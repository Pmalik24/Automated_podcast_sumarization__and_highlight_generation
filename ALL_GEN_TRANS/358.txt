WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLADCONCAS  AS SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO R I'M ENTERHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDISON MY GUEST TO DAY IS RICK REUBEN RICK REUBEN IS A WORLD RENOWNED MUSIC PRODUCER HAVING WORKED WITH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF INCREDIBLE ARTIS PRODUCING FOR INSTANCE RED HOT CHILLY PEPPERS BEASTY BOYS JAISY JOHNNY CASH A DELL LADY GAGA TOM

HAS APPEARED ONCE BEFORE ON THE HUBERMANLAB PODCAST AND DURING THAT APPEARANCE HE OFFER TO ANSWER LISTENERS AND VIEWERS PQUESTIONS THOSE QUESTIONS WERE PUT IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOU TWO AND WE RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF THEM SO TO DAY RICK ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESS I ALSO TOOK NOTE OF THE FEED BACK THAT WHEN RICK PREVIOUSLY APPEARED ON THE HUBERMANLAB PODCAST THAT PERHAPS I SPOKE A BIT MORE THAN THE AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SO TO DAY I REFRAIN FROM SPEAKING TOO MUCH AND TRYIND GIVE AS MUCH AIR TIME AS POSSIBLE TO RICK IN ORDER TO DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS YOULL NOTICE THAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION GETS REALLY INTO THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS THE MOST FREQUENT QUESTIONS THAT I RECEIVE FOR RICK WERE ONES IN WHICH PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS SPECIFIC PROCESS IS EACH IN EVERY DAY AS WELL AS WHEN HE'S PRODUCING MUSIC OR OTHER FORMS OF ART AND OF COURSE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD DO SPECIFICALLY FROM THE TIME THEY WAKE UP UNTIL THE TIME THEY GO TO SLEEP EVEN WHETHER NOT THEY SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF THEIR DREAMS AT CETERA WE GET INTO ALL OF THAT SO TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I HELD WITH RICK PREVIOUSLY AND AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE FROM ANY OF THE OTHER INTERVIEWS OR DISCUSSIONS THAT RICK HAS HAD PUBLICLY BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THINK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS MAI NEWY VENISON NOW WE KNEW E VENISON IS THE MOST NEUTRIANT DENSE AND DELICIOUS RED MEETIV VAILABLE IVE SPOKEN BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST AND THERE'S GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT MOST PEOPLE SHOULD STRIVE TO CONSUME APPROXIMATELY ONE GRAM OF PROTINE PERPOUND OF BODYWEIGHT NOW WHEN ONE STRIVES TO DO THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAXIMISE THE QUALITY OF THAT PROTING AN TAKE TO THE CALORY RATIO BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO CONSUME AN EXCESS OF CALORIES WHEN TRYING TO GET THAT ONE GRAM OF PROTINE PERPOUND OF BODYWEIGHT NOW WE KNEW E VENISON HAS AN EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY PROTING TO CALORY RATIO SO IT MAKES GETTING THAT ONE GRAM OF PROTINE PROPOUND OF BODYWEIGHT EXTREMELY EASY IT'S ALSO DELICIOUS PERSONALLY I LIKE THE GROUND VENISON I'L SOLIKE THE VENISON STAKES AND THEN FOR CONVENIENCE WHEN A M ON THE ROAD I LIKE THE JERKEY THE JERKEY IS A VERY HIGH PROTINE TO CALORY RATIO SO IT HAS AS MUCH AS TEN GRAMS OF PROTINE PUR JERKY STICK AND HAS SOMETHING LIKE ONLY LIKE FIFTY FIVE CALORIE SO AGAIN MAKING VERY EASY TO GET ENOUGH PROTINE WITHOUT CONSUMING EXCESS CALORIES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRY MOWE NEWE VENISON CAN GO TO

US BY EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY I'VE SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS POD CAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE NOW I KEE COMPONENT OF GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS THAT IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TEMPERATURE CHANGES A CUR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES AT THE BEGINNING AN THROUGHOUT AND AT THE END OF YOUR NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IS TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'SWHAT EIGHT SLEEP ALLOWS YOU TO DO IT ALLOWS YOU TO PROGRAM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR MATTRESS AND SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT SUCH THAT YOU FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP EASILY AND WAKE UP EACH MORNING FEELING INCREDIBLY REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED IE BEEN SLEEPING ON AN EGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW AND IT HAS DRAMMATICALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF MY SLEEP SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN I TRAVEL AND I MEN A HOTEL OR AN AIR BEAN BEAND I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MY EIGHT SLEEP I VERY MUCH LOOK FOR TO GETTING HOME BECAUSE MY SLEEP IS ALWAYS BETTER WHEN I SLEEP ON MY EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER

FOR CREATIVITY WITH RICK REUBEN RICK REUBEN WELL COME BACK TANK YOU SIR HAPPY TO BE HERE WE'RE GAN TO ANSWER OR RATHER YOU ARE GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF THE LISTENERS OF OUR PREATHIOUS PODCAST EPISODE BEFORE WE DO THAT HOWEVER WHEN WE WE'RE OUT IN THE LOBBY YOU MENTION THAT YOU HAVE A BREATHING EXERCISE A COHERENTE BREATHING EXERCISE THAT YOU THOUGHT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR US TO DO NOW AND PERHAPS FOR SOME OF THE LISTENERS TO JOIN IN LET'S DO IT AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT AFTER WE CAN SOUNDS GOOD THE REASON I STARTED DOING THIS IS I HAVE RELATIVELY LOW HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND YOU WON'T TO HAVE A HIGH ONE IMS I LOOKED AT ALL THE THINGS THAT CAN RAISE YOUR HART RAE VARYABILITY AND I STARTED DOING THIS BREATHING TECHNIQUE SPECIFICALLY FOR HEART RATE VRYABILITY AN IT WENT UP ALSO IT'S GREAT TEST IT GREAT LET'S DO IT TOGETHER HERE IIT'LL SA TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THEN WHEN YOU'LL HEAR THE SOUND OF A IF YOU FOLLOW ME FOR THE FIRST IN HELLEN EXHELL YOU'LL KNOW WHAT SOUND MEANS W AND YOU DO THIS EYES CLOSE TYPICALLY I DO IT ISE CLOSE IT WILL CLOSE OUR EYES STINKYE A'S FIVE MINUTES LIKE THAT FEELS NICE AS N'T YEL I NOTICE I DON'T SPONTANEOUSLY BREATHE AT THAT CADENCE I KNOWREATHE QUITE A BIT FASTER SO IT SPECIALLY ON THE EXILE SO ONCE I GOT INTO A RHYTHM OF IT THE OTHER MIND JUST GOES SEUDO RANDOM FOR ME WHAT ABOUT FOR YOU DOES YOUR MIND TEND TO GO ONE PLACE I DO NOW I COUNT IM SO THE REASON I KNEW WAS FIVE MINUTES IS BECAUSE IT'S EXPRESS PER MINUTE AND I COUNTED I ONE ONE ONE TO ONE THREE ONE OR ONE FIVE ONC SIX TO ONE SO I WAS OCCUPIED WITH A TASK HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO THAT AT LEAST ONCE AND SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY I AIM FOR TEN MINUTES A DAY BUT IF I GET TO TWENTY MINUTES TO DAY IT IT'S A NOTICEABLE IN MY HARTRA VERYBILITY RESULTS DO YOU DO THE COHERENCE BREATHING AT A PARTICULAR TIMES OF DAY OR JUST WHENEVER IT OCCURS TO YOU I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHERE I AM IN WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN MY LIFES OIT IT IT WAS I HAD A WINDOW A VERY SPECIFIC THING THAT I WAS DOING I WOULD DO COHERENT BREATHING AND I WOULD DO SQUATS JUST AIR SQUATS AND A IN ONE LOCATION ORE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER EQUIPMENT AND AND THEN I FOUND A WAY LIKE WHERE I WAS DOING TREADING WATER WHICH YOU GOT TO EXPERIENCE WITH ME I BOULD TREAD WATER AND THEN AFTER TREADING WATER I WOULD GET OUT OF THE POOL SIN THE SUN AN DO THE COHERENT BREATHING GREAT I WISH YOU POLLY MENTION WHAT I THE TREADING WATER WAS ABOUT EX PEOPLE WONDER IM VERY BRIEFLY I WENT VISIT RICK OVER SEES THIS SUMMER AND WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE DAYTIME IM TREADING WATER WHILE LISTENING TO PODCASTS FROM A SPEAKER ON THE SIDE OF THE POOL AND IT WAS AWSUM IM TIME TOGETHER AS FRIENDS AS AWSUM TIME IN THE SUN IS AWSUM LEARNING FROM PODCASTS AND LISTENING AND BEING ENTERTAINED BY PODCASTS AS ASUM AND THEN TREADING WATER AS AWSUM YEUR MUCH BETTER AT TREADING WATER THAN I AM I WAS FATIGUING IT'S JUST AS'S AS I SAID WHEN WE WERE DOING IT IT'S IT'S SAM IT'S LIKE DOING STAIRS IF YOU PRACTICE DOING STAIRS IT GETS EASIER TO DO STAIRS BUT NOBODY'S GOOD IT DOING IU A MARITHON RUNNERS CAN'T RUN UP THE STAIRS IT'S A YUNUTS A PARTICULAR THING AND TREADING WATER IF YOU JUST DO IT IN EVEN EN LITTLE BIT OF TIME THAT WE WERE DOING IT EVERY DAY BY THE END OF YOUR STAY IT WAS EASIER FOR YOU THAN WHEN YOU STARTED DEFINITELY YET YOU ACCLAMATE QUICKLY YE I WAS ABLE TO ADAPT AS IT PRESSED AT YOUR ENDURANCE IN TREADING WATER EARLY ON BY THE AY I'VE CONTINUED THE TREADING WATER PRACTICE BECAUSE I FORTUNATE TO AVE A POOL IN MY NEW PLACE YEIM I LISTEN TO YOUR PODCAST TRULY  TET YOGRAMATON LOV IT I LOVE LOVE LOV IT I LISTEN TO A FEW OTHER PODCASTS AND I'VE STARTED LISTENING TO MORE APISODES OF THE PODCASTS THAT YOU INTRODUCED ME TO WHICH WAS HISTORY OF ROCK MUSIC AND FIVE HUNDRED SONGS AN YOUR HICKEYS AN

WITH YOU IN YOUR FAMILY I'M AN I'LL INVITE MYSELF AGAIN I ALWAYS WELL ON THE TOPIC OF MEDITATION I ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THIS LIST OF QUESTIONS WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE LIST ITSELF IN A MOMENT IM WAS ABOUT THIS ANECDOTE THAT YOU'VE TOLD ME IND YOU'VE MENTIONED A FEW OTHER PLACES APPARENTLY THAT Y YOUVE ONCE MEDITATED ALL THE WAY FROM WAS IT SAN FRANCISCO TO NEW YORK WHERE AT LOST ANGILESS A TO NEW YORK FLIGHT IT WAS EITHER ELATE IN NEW YORK OR NEW YORK TO ELAI CAN'T REMEMBER AND I MAY HAVE DONE IT WHEN THEN ONCE THE QUESTION  SPECIFICALLY WAS WHICH MEDITATION DID YOU DO T M T M WAS THE FIRST MEDITATION I LEARND TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION LEARNED WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN IT'S IT'S PRETTY MUCH OF DEFAULT A SETTING FOR ME NOW SOMETIMES IT'L EVOLVE FROM T M IN TO BREATHING LIKE I MIGHT START BY DOING BREATHING BEFORE THE T M PIECE STARTS AND  AND THE BREATHING MAY JUST TAKE THE WHOLE TIME OR IT MAY TURN FROM BREATHING INTO A GRATITUDE PRACTICE OR M META PRACTICE WHICH IS A FOR PHRASES MAY I BE FILLED WITH LOVING KINDNESS MAY I BE WELL MAY I BE PEACEFUL AND AT EASE MAY I BE HAPPY AND YOU REPEAT THOSE PHRASES OVER AND OVER AND IT STARTS MAY I AND THEN EVENTUALLY IF YOU'VE DONE IT FOR YEAR SO YOU COULD START SAYING MAY WE FOR YOUR F IMMEDIATE FAMILY AND THEN MAY EMEN AS YOU BUILD UP THE CHARGE FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY IN ANOTHER YEAR OR SO YOU CAN SPREAD IT TO YOUR COMMUNITY AND EVENTUALLY AFTER MAY BE FIVE YEARS YOU CAN DO IT FOR THE PLANET SO THAT'S THE META META M ETTA MAY AS I LOVING KINDNESS PRACTICE AND ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR LENKS MAY BE COULD PASS US LATER AND WE COULD PUT ON THA MY APTIONS MAY ONE THAT YOUUI LEARNED IT FROM JACK CORNFIELD WHOSE A BUDDHIST SCHOLAR AND THE BRILLIANT TCHER TERRIFIC WHAT EYOU THING MEDITATION IS A LOUD YOU AFFORD DID YOU AS WELL AS WHAT IT'S HELPED YOU AVOID IN TERMS OF A DAILY PRACTICE OR IM MAYBN JUST HOW DOING IT ONCE IN A WHILE HAS WICKED OUT INTO EREAS OF YOUR LIFE THIT'S PROLLY LONG LIST OF THINGS BUT IF YOU WERE TO PICK MAYBE LIKE THE TOP THREE WEGL YET WHEN I'M MEDITATING REGULARLY BLANK HAPPENS AND BLANK DOESN'T HAPPEN AND WHEN I'M NOT THOSE THINGS CAUSE I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR SUCH A LONG TIME IT'S SO OM PARTON PARCEL OF WHO I AM THAT WITHOUT I DON'T KNOW WHO I WOULD BE WITHOUT IT THAT'S SAID I DON'T ALWAYS DO IT BUT I DON'T HAVE AT THIS POINT I DON'T HAVE TO ALWAYS DO IT TO BE IN THIS ZOWN WHERE I'V BEEN YOU KNOW FOR ALMOST FOR WEU KNOW FORTY FIVE YEARS AS SPEN A BIG PART OF MY LIFE SO A GREAT DEAL OF THE BENEFITS HAVE ART IN ME NOW WHEN I PRACTISE IT ITS AMPLIFIED BUT IM AS MAHERICHI DESCRIBED IT EVERY TIME YOU MEDITATE IS LIKE MAKING A DEPOSIT IN A BANK SO IT'S ALWAYS THERE EVERY TIME YOU DO IT IT'S YOUR BUILDING A BASE AND THE GOAL OF THE PRACTICE IS LESS ABOUT THE PRACTICE IS ABOUT THE PRACTICE IS TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU ARE IN THE WORLD SO IT'S A PRACTICE FOR LIFE DO YOU KNOW T HIM SAYING LIKE THTHE CHANGES THAT COME IN THE MEDITATION AR TO HELP YOUR REACTIONS IN THE REAL WORLD IN SOME WAYS NOT THA TRIVIALIZE IT BUT IT'S LIKE PHYSICAL EXERCISE YET CEERING TE GO TO WORK OUT YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IS REALLY ELEVATED YOUR SECRETING ALL SORTS OF INFLANMATORY SIDE O KINDS YEEF WE'DARE WERE TO DRAW YOUR BLOOD MID WORK OUT YOU'D SAY THIS PERSON IS IN TROUBLE BUT THEN ALL THESE WONDERFUL ADAPTATIONS OCCUR THAT ALLOW YOU TO SLEEP BETTER BETTER MOOD WALK UPSTAIRS EASILY AND ON AND AN IT'S FUNNY ABOUT SLEEPING ABETTER THIS MORNING I WAS WALKING ON THE BEACH AND UM AND MY HEADPHONES ON WIRED HEADPHONES AND I WAS LISTENING TO APODCAST I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I WAS LISTENING TO BUT I WAS LISTENING TO A PODCAST AND SOME ONE FLAGED ME AND INTERRUPTED ME WHO I DIDN'T KNOW AND WENT OVER TO TALK TO HIM HE SAID I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT SEVE MARK NOT APODCAST AND AAND HE TOLD ME STORY ABOUT STEEP MARTIN THAT HE GOT SEE HIM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE I WOULD SAY THIS PERSON WAS PROBABLY MIDST MIDTO LATE SUXTIES AND HE WAS WEARING ALL BLACK HE WAS WEARING SHOES ON THE BEACH A TENS SHOES HE WAS WEARING DARK SUN GLASSES AND A HAT AND UM HE SAID JUST WONT TALK ABOUT COMEDY AND THINGS THAT HE HEARD ME SOUND A PODCAST AN WE TALKED ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT TAT HE LOVES PODCAST ANG HE LISTENS TO HIM AT NIGHT CAUSE HE'S GOT TERRIBLE AND SOMNEAND HE CAN'T SLEEP AND I'M LOOKING AT A GUIT IN THE SUN WEARING SUN GLASSES AND I SAY WELL YOU KNOW THE REASON YOU CAN'T SLEEP IS BECAUSE YOU WERING SUNGLASSES NOW SAID WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT SAID WILL THE WAY THE THE HUMAN BODY WORKS IS WE REACT TO THE SUN THE SN IS WHAT TELLS US WE'RE AWAKE AND THAT AT NIGHT WHEN IT'S DARK THAT'S WHAT TELLS US TO GO TO SLEEP SO YOU'RE MIXING HE SIGNALS TO YOUR BODY BY WEARING THE SUN GLASSES AND HE SAID WELL WELL OMA DERMITOLOGIST AND YOU IVE BEEN ADOMHE SAID HE WAS A DERM DERMATALLJUS FOR LASS FORTY YEARS AND MY WHOLE PRACTICES ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF THE SUN AND AND I SI WE START TALKING ABOUT IT AND A HE HE WAS ALL COVERED UP I WAS WEARING AM MY MY BOARD SHORT AN NOTHING ELSE AND AND I SOLOM IN THE SUN YOU KNOW HOURS EVERY DAY AND AND I AS I ARN'T YOU WERIED ABOUT TA CAN SER ND I SAID I I FEEL PRETTY HEALTHY I FEEL OKAY AND THEN HE SAID LET ME SEE YOR ABACK AND I TURNED AROUND HE LOOKED AT MY BACKINS LIK YOU'VE PERFECT SKIN THATE THEY SHOULD STUDY YOU IN A IN A A IN AN INSTITUTE I SAID THIS IS WHAT NORMALS THIS IS WHAT NORMAL HEALTHY SKIN LOOKS LIKE IF YOU EXPOSE IT TO THE SUN ANY SITS YOUR THING EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN TEACHING IN MY IN MY A MEDICAL PRACTICE FOR LAST WORD USUALY WRONG SUGGEST EVERYTHING THOS FUNNY FUNNY CONVERSATION YETS INTERESTING IVIN WE COULD GO DOWN A DEEP RABIT HOLE WITH THIS BUT IN A LISTENERS OF THIS PYCAST WILL KNOW THAT I'M YOU VERY MUCH PROPONENG OF GETTING THOSE SUNLIGHT SIGNALS TO THE EYES AT LEAST ONCE A DAY IN THE MORNING BUT ALSO IN IN THE EVENING THE US I'LL JUST SHARE WITH YOU IM NOW I LEARNED FROM A A GHAST US UP SO WE HAVE AN I'M AIRED YET THAT THE WHAT IS SO SPECIAL BUT THAT MORNING AN EVENING SUNLIGHT ARE THE CONTRASTS BETWEEN BLUES AND ORANGES BLUES AND REDS BLUES AND PINKS THT WE CAN'T ALWAYS SEE IF THERE'S CLOUD COVER BUT THEY COME THROUGH AND IT'S THE MATHEMATICAL DIFFERENCE IN THEIR PRESENCE OF TRACTION OF A LOT OF BLUE AN THE NEXT TO IT A LOT OF ORANGE OR A LOT OF BLUE AND THE NEXT TO T A LOT OF PINK THAT TRIGGERS THE BODY'S UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS MORNING AN EVENING AND THAT NIGHT IS COMING IN THE EVENING AND THE IS TIME BE AWAKEN IN THE MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN THE SUN IS OUT AND IT'S OVERHEAD IT LOOKS LIKE WHITE LIGHT AND WHITE LIGHT INCLUDES THE BLUES IN THE ORANGES AND THE PINKS AND THE REDS BUT THE THEY SUBTRACT TO ZERO BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL MIXED THE OTHER THAT'S WHY IT LOOKS JUST BLUE AND WHITE AND SO WHILE BRIGHT LIGHT IS GREAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT'S THOS MORNING SIGNALS NOW THE I THINK THE DERMATOLOGY COMMUNITY IS STARTING TO COME ON LINE WITH THE IDEA THAT LOW SOLAR ANGLE SUNLIGHT EARLY AND LATER IN THE DAY SUNRISE AND SUNRISING AND SUN SETTING AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS GO OHD YOU HAVE TO SEE ACROSS THE HORIZON THAT WOULD BE IDEAL BUT RISING AND SETTING DO NOT CREATE THE KIND OF SKIN DAMAGER I DAMAGE THAT THEY'VE BEEN SO CONCERNED ABOUT AND I THINK THE NEXT STEP FOR THE FIELD OF DERMATOLOGY IS GOING TO BE TO START COMMUNICATING WITH THE NURROW SCIENTISTS AND THE CIRCADY AN BIOLOGISTS AND AND REALLY A LEARNING THATS THO THNKS FOR BRIDGING THAT GAP ON THE BEACH THIS MORNING I I DO THINK THAT'S HOW IT STARTS AND THEN IT WIKS OUT HEAD PHONES SO IM I MADE THE CHOICE A FEW YEARS AGO TO STOP USING THE BLUE TOOTH HEADPHONS BASED ON EXMY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS I KEPT GETTING THESE SISTS BEHIND MY EARS WHICH I WAS TOLD WERE LIMPH SWELLINGS OF LIMPH THEY WOULD ACTUALY DRAIN LIMPH IF THEY GOT BIG ENOUGH IS THERE'S REALLY GROSS AND C TROUBLING I STOPPED USING THEM I DIDN'T GET THEM I START USING THEM AGAIN IS AR GAIN THOSE LIMP THINGS AND AND THERE WAS SOME SIGNIFICANT HEAT EFFECTS AS WELL IM AND I T INTERVIEWED A COUPLE PEOPLE INCLUDING A NURW SURGEON ON THE POD CAST ABOUT U'M THE LEVEL OF THEAMATS THAT COME FROM THEM AND THEY WERE NOT CONCERNED OTHERS I'VE SPOKEN TO ARE CONCERNED I WHEN A TRYIN BALANCE OUT THE CONVERSATION OVER TIME BUT MY FEELING WAS LOOK IF THERE'S ANY CONCERN WHATSOEVER WHI WOULD I USE THEM AND I SO I USE THE ONES WITH WIRES BUT USE THE ONES WITH WIRES THERE EVEN ONE STEP FURTHER AWAY FROM IM WHIFE I TRANSMETTET ILL ONES WITH AIR TUBES THAT I USED O ING ON WAS GOING ON UM AND THOSE HAVE NO ELECTRICAL AM THERE'S NO ELECTRIC NEAR YOUR HEAD IT'S JUST AN AIR TO WHERE THE SOUND IS TRAVELLING THIS ACTUAL SOUND IS TRAVELLING IN THE TOBSTERIOUS I DON'T ONLY SLEEP BETTER WITH THE PHONE OUT OF THE BEDROOM SOME PEOPLE ARE NOW TURNING OFF THEIR WIFE FIE AT NIGHT I THINK YOU AND I ARE BOTH REALLY ALINE IN THE SENSE THAT WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH THINGS COMING GO IN THE HEALTH SPACE LIKE DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT LIFTING WEIGHTS LIKE THAT'S JUST FOR BODY BUILDERS AND AT NOW EVERYBODY KNOWT OF MUSCLE BOUND YOU REKE A MUSCLE BOUNT IGHT NOW MEN AND WOMEN ELDERLY AND YOUNG ARE ENCOURAGED TO DO RESISTANCE TRAINING A YOGO US TO BE CAST IN THIS KIND OF MAGIC CARPET REALM BREATH WORK ALL THIS SNUFF IS BECOME OVER TIME MAINSTREAM BUT IT'S TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME IN THE ROAD HAS BEEN CHOPPY AN SOMETIMES MY OPINION REALLY UN FAIR TO THE TO THE PRACTIC ES AND AND THEIR VALUE IA MTHESE ARE ZERO COST PRACTICES IN MANY CASES THAT CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE SUNSCREEN OR OR YOU KNOW BLUE TOS HEAD PHONES OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS IE WISH I HAD A PORTAL INTO THE FUTURE WHERE WE LOOK BACK AND   LIKE OF COURSE OF COURSE TO WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON JUST COUND OF A HEALTH AND WELLNESS AS YOU'VE OBSERVED IT IN THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS A'M YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS FOR A WHILE 'M YOU'VE PAID ATTENTION TO MINEFULNESS AND MINE BODY STUFF YO WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS I I TRY TO LIVE IN AS NATURAL WAY AS POSSIBLE I TRID E IS FEW PROCESS FOODS AS POSSIBLE TRID E GRASSFED ANIMALS A AND AND I USE HARDLY ANY PRODUCTS OF ANY KIND YOU KNOW THAT THAT AREN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT GROWS OR LIVES ON THE PLANET THERE WERE COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS ALL LAST NOW AM YOU' LOST A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT AWAY YOU LOOK GREAT BY THE WAY THINK YOU LOOK SUPERFIT EVERYTIME I SEEL IER IN BETTER IN BETTER SHAPE AM AND A THAT' THAT'S IN THAT'S YOUR PERCEPTION IT'S NOT IN FACT THE CASE I YERE YOUR CEC OH NO WHEN I SEE EACH TIME YOU COMING YOU'R EXTREMELY MOBILE YOU YOU SLEEPING WELL AVE A ROBOST LIFE LIKE YOU NO IN ALL THE MARKS OF HALTH AND VITALITY AM SO I'VE HEARD YOU MENTION BEFORE THAT YOU LOST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT HOW MUCH WEIGHT AND HOW DID YOU DO IT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POUNDS THROUGH A HI PROTENE LOW CALLORY LOW CARBDIET AND THAT WENT AGAINST THE CONVENTION AT THE TIME WELL THE PERSON WHO SUGGESTED IT WAS A A SOME ONE AT YOU SEE A LA SO IT WAS A MAINSTREAME DOCTOR WHO HEALPED ME WITH MY WAYLOST I HAD BEEN AVIGAN AT THAT TIME WHICH WAS NOT MAINSTREME THEN AND IT WAS VERY UNHEALTHY BUT I DID THAT FOR TWENTY SOMEHOD YEARS BECAUSE I BELIEVED IN THE FHURY OF IT BUT IT PROVED NOT TO BE A HEALTHY FOR ME DO YOU THINK THA DIFFERENT DIETS LIKELY WORK FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE YES SO THAT NOT EVERY ONE NECESSARILY SHOULD DO WHAT YOU DID BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY BENEFIT FROM HEALTHY READ ME I'M SAYING THAT ONLY BECAUSE IT SO VILLIFIED IN OUR CULTURE YE I AGREE AND I THINK THE HEALTHY PIECEAS KEY THERE TO NONFACTORY FARMED ANIMALS I'M WHICH FORTUNALLY REASONABLY COST SOURCES THAT ARE BECOMING MORE AVAILABLE WELL EMINENT START PULLING FROM THE LIST OF QUESTIONS A BY THE WAY FOLKS THERE WERE MORE THAN A THOUSAND QUESTIONS IN JUST THE ONE THIRD PRINT OUT THAT I DID A THAN INTIMIDATING STACK IN FRONT OF YET THE MOST NOTES I'VE EVER PUT IN FRONT OF ME DURING A GUEST A DISCUSTION HERE ON THE PODCAST AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO ASK YOU EVERY QUESTION BUT I'VE ORGANIZED A MINITE IN AS SOME SENSE OF COHERENT ORDER IM DID YOU ORGANIZE A MAR A I ORGANIZE THEM I ORGANIZE THEM BUT THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ASK YOU ONE OF QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP SEVERAL TIMES WHICH WAS IM WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON A  AND ITS ABILITY TO I'M SHAPE HOW MUSIC IS MADE HOW VISUAL ARTS ARE MADE ARE YOU ONE OF THESE LIKE SCARED OF  I AR U EMBRACE NEW TECHNOLOGY I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT YET TO TO TALK ABOUT IT WHAT I WILL SAY IS WHAT WHAT I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT ART IS THE POINT F VIEW OF THE PERSON MAKING IT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT A I HAS A POINT OF VIEW OF ITS OWN SO I'M AT I DON'T KNOW HOW INTERESTING IT WOULD BE A I'S POINT OF VIEW BUT I LIKE PEOPLE'S POINTS OF VIEW AND WHAT MAKES AN ARTIST A GREAT ARTS TO ME IS SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR POINT OF VIEW DOES SOMETHING WITH TO ME CHILDHOOD A QUESTION FOR RICK REUBEN WAS WHAT ACTIVITIES DID YOU FIND MOST ENJOYABLE AND EASY TO GET LOST IN AS A CHILD I LOVE THIS QUESTION FOR YOU IN PARTICULAR READING WAS A BIG PART OF MY LIFE LISTENING TO MUSIC LA OBIG PART OF MY LIFE PLAYING GE TAR ALONG WITH MUSIC CAN'T REALLY PLAY BUT THE IDEA OF PLAYING ALONG 'S A DIDN'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE GOOD ENOUGH TO PLAY ALONGS I DIDN'T HAVE THAT SKILL SET BUT I LIKE THE EXPERIENCE OF DOING MY BEST TO PLAY ALONG WITH SOMETHING I WAS LISTENING TO AND IM ALSO MAGIC A LEARNING LIKE SHUFFLING CARTS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND UM CLOIN TRICKS AND A SLIGHT OF HAND WAS JUST INTERESTING TO ME DO YOU STILL DO MAGIC I DON'T AT THE TIME THAT MUSIC TOOK OVER MY LIFE I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWOAS BOTH OF THEM WERE FULL TIME LIFE PURSUITS I WENT SAW MENTALIST IN NEW YORK THE SUMMER WITH MY SISTER A S WIND IS HIS NAME A S I FIRST NAME LAST NAME WIND EVERY TIME I SEE HIM MENTALIST ESPECIALL E WHEN I SEE OSI I'VESEEN HIM TWICE IT IT BLOWS MY MIND WHAT AE YOUR THOUGHTS ON MENTALISTS AS MY FAVORITE FORM A MAGIC REALLY MOST INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T RELY ON CROPS IT RE IT'S IT'S IT'S PURE UM IT FEELS LIKE PURE MAGIC YOU KNOW IF IT IF YOU HAVE A BOX AND YOU PULL SOMETHING OUT OF THE BOCX IT PROBABLY SOMETHING TRICKY ABOUT THE BOC BUT WHEN SOME ONE CAN LOOK AT YOU AND TELL YOU WARE YOU THINKING IT'S JUST WILD IT'S REALLY WILD S I LOVE THAT AFTER ASE DID HIS HIS ACT UM WHEN WE SEUDO RETURN TO REALITY CAUSE IT REALLY DOES CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THINGS AFTER THAT FOR QUITE A WHILE MAYBE FOREVER I ASKE HIM IF HE WAS WILLING TO SHARE MAYBE JUST LIK ONE NUGGET OF INSIDE INTO HOW HE DOES WHAT HE DOES WITH AND OF COURSE I WASN'T EXPECTING HE WAS GIVE AWAY THE WHOLE THING AND HE SAID UM A LOT OF ASS TO DO WITH FORMING IN A RACING MEMORIES IN PEOPLE QUICKLY WHICH SOUNDS VERY KIND OF DARK AND MYSTERIAUSLY INTERESTED YET THAT MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT TWO ERACE MEMORIES WHY LET IT LIK MAYBE WHAT WE THOUGHT WE SAW WE REALLY DIDN'T SEE OR HERE WSO I I'D TIK THAT DESCRIPTION YE I'M MIN TO BRING HIM OUT HERE WILE A SO WE SHOULD ALL GET AGOTHER AND LOVE Y ALWI WANTOD AT HIM ON THE PODCAST THEY A FOOL TEN PER CENT OF THE QUESTIONS FOR YOU WE'RE AROUND WRITERS BLOCK STICKING POINTS THIS KIND OF THING LIKE FEELING STOCK IN THE CREATIVE CROCESS NOW PEOPLE TIDN'T SPECIFY WHETHER NOT THEY WERE STOCK AT THE BEGINNING THE MIDDLE OF THE END BUT BASED ON MY READ OF ALL THESE QUESTIONS I GOT THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE WERE FEELING LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING IN THEM THAT THEY WANT ACCESS TO THEY WANT TO CREATE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET PAST THAT INITIAL STAGE I SUPPOSE TO SOMEBODYIS LIKE NINY PERE CENT DONE AND THEY JUST CAN'T FINISH THE LAST TEN PER CENT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THESE KINDS OF BLOCKS AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM UM ANY EXPERIENCE YOU'VE HAD WITH THEM YOURSELF AND PERHAPS WITH I WORKING WITH OTHER ARTISTS THE FIRST THOUD S TO GO PAST THE IDEAR OF THE BLOCK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS WHAT'S THE CAUSE OF THE BLOK AND THE BLOCK IS USUALLY SOMETHING LIKE IT'S EITHER A PERSONAL I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH IT'S IT CAN BE A CONFIDENCE ISSUE I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY OR IT COULD BE A UM THINKING ABOUT SOME ONE ELSE NOBODY'S CAN ALIKE WHAT I MAKE DID YOU KNOW IM SAYING SO'S EITHER A A SELF JUDGMENT OR FEAR OF OUTSIDE JUDGMENT SO IF YOU'RE MAKING SOMETHING WITH WITH A FREEDOM OF THIS IS SOMETHING I'M MAKING FORM MYSELF FOR NOW THAT'S ALL IT IS IT'S A DIARY ENTRY EVERYTHING I MAKE IS A DIARY ENTRY THE BEAUTY OF A DIARY ENTRY IS I CAN WRITE MY DIARY ENTRY AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME MY DIARY ENTRY WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH OR THAT'S NOT WHAT I THAT'S NOT WHAT I EXPERIENCED OF COURSE IT'S WHAT I EXPERIENCEITS I'M WRITING A PERSONAL DIARY FOR MYSELF YOU'D NO ONE ELSE CAN JUDGE IT IT IS MY EXPERIENCE OF OF MY LIFE EVERYTHING WE MAKE CAN BE THAT CAN BE A PERSONAL REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE IN THAT MOMENT OF TIME IT DOESN'T HVE TO BE THE GREATES YOU COULD EVER DO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY EXPECTATION THAT IT'S GIN A CHANGE THE WORLD IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS HAS TO SELL A CERTAIN NUMBER COPIES FOR ANY REASON IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE THINGS ALL IT IS IS I'M MAKING THIS THING I MAKING THIS THING FOR ME AND I I WANTA DO IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY TO WHERE I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT AND WHERE IT'S HONEST IT'S HONEST OF WHERE I'M AT AND IF YOU'RE LIVING IN THIS WORLD OF JUST BEING HONEST WHERE YOU'RE AT THERE'S NOTHING BLOCKING THAT DID YOU KNOW T I'M SAYING THERE ARE NO BLOCKS THE BLOKS ARE ALL BASED ON DEALING WITH A DIFFERENT FORCE OR A DIFFERENT PERCEPTION THAT IS MADE UP YOU MAKE UP THIS STORY AND YOU'RE LIVING THE STORY I'M IN THIS BLOCK BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T DO IT THE REASON YOU CAN'T DO IT IS BECAUSE HERE AFRAID SOME ONE ELSE IS NOCKING A LIKE IT OR YOU'RE  THERE ARE NO BLOCKS IS THERE'S INFINITE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE TO WORK WITH BECAUSE IT DOESN'T IT ALSO DOESN'T STEM FROM US SO IT WHERE WERE VEHICLES FOR THIS INFORMATION AND IT'S COMING THROUGH US ALL THE TIME SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN I DEA WHEN YOURE SITTING AT YOU DESK IF YOU GO FOR WLACK CHANCES ARE YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT'LL SPARK SOMETHING IN YOU AS A AS A SEED TO TAKE OFF FROM THAT MAKES A LOT OF SANSE AND HAD A THOUGHT WHILE YOU ARE SAYING THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I HAVE IN COMPLETING WORK IN GETTING INTO A GOOD WORK GRIEV IS THAT I'M ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS BECAUSE OF PHONES AND SO EASY TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT'S NOT THAT THEY INTERRUPT ME IT'S THAT AN THIS HAPPEN THE OTHER DAY I SET UP MY NEW OFF ICE REALLY NICELY 'M LIVING IN A VERY QUIET PLACE NOW IT'S LIKE ALMOST COMPLETELY SILENT UNLESS I'M PLAING MUSIC IT'S REALLY INTERESTIN WHAR THER IOTI SOMETIMES COME AROUND AND START DOING THEIR THING AT NIGHT BUT COMPLETELY SILENT AND I REALIZE I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING INTO A WORK GROOF AND I REALIZE THAT I FELT COMPELLED TO CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE AND THEN I REALIZE AS YOU'D JUST PROVIDED YOUR ANSWER TO THE LAST QUESTION THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY SOMETHING IN ME THAT HAS A BIT OF A FEAR OF SEPARATION ARE ABANDONMENT FROM PEOPLE A BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND I FEEL VERY WELL SUPPORTED BY MY FRIENDS AND CO WORKERS THESE DAYS VERY VERY WELL SUPPORTED I'M IN I CON A PINCH ME PLACE AROUND THAT AND BUT I REALIZE NOW THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY MIND IS IT'S NOT A CHALLEGE OF GETTING INTO THE WORK IT'S A FEAR THAT IF I SPEND A COUPLE HOURS REALLY IN THAT TIGHT TONNEL OF CREATION THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANYONE THERE WHENE I EXIT IT WHICH IS A CRAZY THOUGHT AT'S TH CRASY BI THAT'S THE ANXIETY I ONLY REALIZE THAT NOW SO THANK YOU GREAT YOU KNOW I TRUST THAT YOU GUISI'LL BE THERE WHEN I WHEN I XIT THE TONG WO AND WHEN THERE'S A DEAD LINE I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO JUMP INTO THAT TUNNEL THAT THOT'S I SHALLY WHAT HELPS DEADLINES REALLY HELP ME TO DEADLINES HELP YOU DO YOU LIKE DEADLINES I DEDLINES DON'T HELP ME AT THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS THEY CAN HELP AT THE END ONCE THE CODES BEEN CRACKED USUALLY WHEN I START SOMETHING I HAVE NO IDEA WHATS CAN TO BE UM SIT'S A VERY OPEN PROCESS IN THE BEGINNING AND IF THERE'S ANY SENSE OF REQUIRED TIMING THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE FREEDOM NEEDED FRIT TO BE ALL THAT IT COULD BE BUT ONCE THE CODES CRACKED AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS AND IT'S ALL THERE AND YOUR JUST YOU KNOW THE YOU DEALING WITH THE FINE POINTS THEN UM IT CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE A DEDLINE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING AG ONE DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSOR IN THE POD CAST AG ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT'S DESIGNED TO ME ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATION AL NUTRITIAN NEEDS OF COURSE I TRY TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF VITEMENS AND MINERALS THROUGH WHOLE FOOD SOURCES THAT INCLUDE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS EVERY DAY BUT OFTEN TIMES I SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH SERVINGS BUT WITH AG ONE I'VM SURE TO GET ENOUGH VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED AND IT ALSO CON TAINS ADAPTAGENS TO HELP BUFFER STRESS SIMPLY PUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I TAKE G ONE I HAVE MORE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND I SLEEP BETTER AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO TASTE RIGHT FOR ALL THESE REASONS WHENEVER I'M ASKED IF YOU COUL TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT WOULD IT BE I ANSWER AG ONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY AG ONE THEY'LL TO DRINK AG ONE DOC CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK AG ONE DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WERE SORT OF COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE B LEAVE YOUR PROCESS IS AND ONE OF THE REPEATING THINGS THERE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING WAS IT SEEMS THAT RICK REUBEN IS COMFORTABLE WITH UNCERTAINTY AND THE UNKNOWN YES THAT IS TRUE T YES AND YES I AM COMFORTABLE WITH IT BECAUSE I ACCEPT THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE THAT SAID WHEN I START A NEW PROJECT I ALWAYS HAVE ANXIETY BECAUSE I'M UNCERTAIN OF WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN AND I WANT IT TO BE GOOD NOW I KNOW IT WON'T BE DONE UNTIL I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT SOIN THAT WAY THERE IS NO UM HERE'S NO REAL PRESSURE BUT I DO STILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY OF I WONDER WHAT'S CON A HAPPEN TO DAY I HOPE IT'S GOOD YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE WORKED WITH MUSICAL ARTISTS LET'S SAY IM HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO YOU TO KNOW WHAT CHALLENGE IS MAYBE EVEN WHAT SUCCESS IS BUT CERTAINLY WHAT CHALLENGES THEY HAPPEN TO BE GOING THROUGH AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME PUT DIFFERENTLY DOYOU AN FINDING YOURSELF PLAYING PHARAPIST AND GUIDE AND IM PSYCHOLOGICAL SLASH AMOTIONAL MENTOR TO ARTIST YOU WORK WITH JURING THE CREATIVE PROCESS OR'S THAT SEPARATE IF THEY'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S INTDERFERING WITH THE WORK ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THE WORK IS SOMETHING WORTH DISCUSSING OUR FOCUS THEY'RE TOGETHER IS TO GET THE WORK DONE SOMETIMES IT ENDS UP BEING MORE THEREPUTID TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT REALLY STOOD OUT TO ME IN THIS VAST LIST OF QUESTIONS M INVOLVED A QUOTE FROM YOUR LAST DISCUSSION ON THE SPOTCAST OUR LAST DISCUSSION ON THE SPOTCAST IM SOME ONE A READ A LITTLE BIT OF IT CAUSE IT'S FAIRLY LONG BUT I'M IVE FOUND THIS TO BE A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD GET INTO AN A BIT MORE DEPTH IM SOMEBODY I DON'T KNOW WHO SAID IF YOU HAPPEN TO TALK TO RICK HAPPEN TO BE TALKINGTO YOU 'M ASKING THIS FOR ME IN HIS BOOK IN THE SECTION ON SELF DOUBT RICK SAID QUOTE ONE OF THE REASON SO MANY GREAT ARTIST DIE OF OVERDOSEIS EARLY IN THEIR LIVES AS BECAUSE THEY USED DRUGS TO NUMB A VERY PAINFUL EXISTENCE THE REASON THIT IS PAINFUL AS THE REASON THEY BECAME AN ARTIST IN THE FIRST PLACE THEREINCREDIBLE SENSITIVITY IF YOU SEE TREMENDOUS BEAUTY OR TREMENDOUS PAIN WHERE OTHER PEOPLE SEE LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH BIG FEELINGS ALL THE TIME THESE EMOTIONS CAN BE CONFUSING AND OVERWHELM AN OVERWHELMING EXCUSE ME SO THIS GOES ON FOR SOME PAGES AND THEN THIS PERSON SAYS AND I THINK THEY'RE SPEAKING FOR MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAID THIS RESONADE WITH ME PERSONALLY AND I WONDER WHETHER NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MAYBE YOU'VE EXPERIENCE YOURSELF OR THAT YOU JUST NOTICE ABOUT ARTIST AND SIMILAR SITUATIONS AND WHAT SORT OF ADVICE DO YOU GIVE THE ARTIST YOU WORK WITH IN ORDER TO EMBRACE THOSE PAINFUL TONES WITHIN THEM AND TRANSMUTE THEM INTO GREAT WORK I'E DEFINITELY FELT THEN MYSELF IM UNUSUALLY SENSITIVE IN THE WORLD A WERRING RED GLASSES IN HERE FOR REASON UM I LIVE VERY UM PROTECTED MONK LIKE LIFE BECAUSE STIMULATION GET'S IN THE WAY OF MY ABILITY TO BEWHI WANT TO BE SO I TEND TO STAY AWAY FROM THINGS UM AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE WITH MANY ARTISTS UM I DESIRE FOR NURTURING THEIR INTERNAL LIFE AND IF IF THE GOLD IS TO NURTURE ARE INTERNAL LIFE IT IT UM IT INVARIABLY LEADS TO SACRIFICES DID YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME ALONE AS A KID I'M ASKING THI I DID YE I WAS ONLY CHILD AND I SPEND MOST O MY TIME ALONE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CONTROLLING THIS AMOUNTANDTYPE OF STIMULATION IN YOUR LIFE TO PROTECT THAT INNER LEN LANDSCAPE IS THAT PRETAIN TO CERTAIN PERSONALITY TYPES EVEN VOICE TYPES IVE I FOUND IT VERIS TIMES IN MY LIFE I LOVE PEOPLE BUT UM THERE THERE CERTAIN VOICES THAT JUST GREAT ON ME AND I CAN'T BE AROUND THEM I CAM'P BE AROUND THON THE DRIVING IT BRINGS OUT ITHIT JUST IT'S LIKE  COFFINY INSIDE I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M BEING ASKED TO DRINK SOMETHING THAT TASTE AWFUL UM DOES IT DOES THAT RESONET I I TRY TO CURATE THE PEOPLE AROUND ME TO BE PEOPLE I WANT TO HAVE AROUND ME WHATEVER THAT IS RIGHT WHATEVERWYOU SAID YOU PROTECT THE INNER LANDSCAPE BUT CERTAINLY YOU'RE NOT AVERSE TO HIGH INTENSITY STIMULATION I LAST NIGHT WE WENT T THE A W AND BY THE WAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME THAT WAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE HE WASRETEDIT WAS REALLY FUN ETERYMINDING ME OF EARLY PUNKOCK SHOWS WHERE T THE SOME OF MY FIRST PUNKROCK SHOWS OR I WENT JSLIKE ALL MY HASH THIS IS EXCITING AND SCARY AND I LOVE IT AND IT FELT LOVING TOO YES WHICH IS ALSO THE COMMUNITY OF PUNKROCK THAT I OBSERVED AND HAVE BEEN BLESSED BE A PART OF IT'S LIK I IT'S LIKE THERE Y OTHER'S A GRASSION BUT THERE'S ALSO LOVE AND THEN THERE'S ROMANCE AND THEN THERE'S ALSO UM BETRAYAL THERE'S ALL THE ELEMENTS BUT THERE'S STILL A SENSE LIKE EVERYONE WANTS TO BE HERE AND T AT THERE'S A SENSE OF GOODNESS BEHIND IT ALL EVEN THOUGH SOME OF IT WAS BLOODY AND VIOLENT YES SO FOR YOU WHAT IT WHAT IS IT RESTLING ALLOW YOU TO FEEL IN THOSE HIGH INTENSITY IN VIROENCS IT COMPLETELY RELAXES ME BECAUSE THERE 'RE NO STAKES YOU KNOW NOBODY EVERY ONE'S WORKING TOGETHER IN THE SHOW TO PROTECT EACH OTHER NO ONE'S TRYING TO HURT ANYBODY REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE STORY LINENS IT'S LIKE A BALLET WHERE THERE'S A FIGHT IN THE BALLET THERE'S NO UM THERE'S NO ACTUAL AGGRESSION PEOPLE TOWARDS EACH OTHER IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE BUT YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE THIS WILDLY DYNAMIC EXCITING SEREAL THEATRPIECE  WHERE PEOPLE ARE DOING THESE A GYMNASTIC AND ACROBATIC THINGS THAT ARE TRULY DETHTIFING UM AND IT'S FUN IN THE THE STORY LINES ABSORB YOU IN A WAY WERE YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT'S NOT BUT WE KNOW WE KNOW WRESTLING'S FAKE WERE TOLD WRESTLINGSFAKE BUT THERE'S SOMETHING UM LEGITIMATE ABOUT IT THAT SEEMS TO ME MORE LEGITIMATE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE MOST LEGITIMATE BECAUSE IT'S THE CLOSEST TO WHAT THE WORLD'S ACTUALLY LIKE PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS TELL YOU WHAT THEY REALLY THINK AND WHEN SOME ONE TELLS YOU STORY IT MIGHT NOT REALLY BE THE TRUE STORY THEY MAY EVEN THINK THEY MAY BE THEY MAY THINK THEY'RE TELLING YOU THE REAL STORY AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE REAL STORY WE DON'T KNOW WE KNOW SO LITTL YOU KNOW WE WE WE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING AND THEN WE MAKE UP A STORY TO UNDERSTAND IT OURSELVES AND THEN FOREVERMORE WHEN WE TELL THAT STORY IT WAS OUR VERSION OF OF AN EXPERIENCE BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN THAT WAS OUR TAKE ON IT UM WRESTLING IT'S LIKE THAT'S WHAT THE REAL WORLD IS LIKE BECAUSE WE WHEN YOU WATCH WRESTLING YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S TRUE THAT'S WHAT IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS LIKE YOU AR WRESTLING AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S TRUE IT'S MORE IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE YOU'D YOU'D HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THE WORLD IF YOU TOOK IT ALL IN LIKE IT WAS CA RESTLING I THINK WE'RE IN A PLACE IN HUMAN HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT THE MEDIA IT'S ALSO WHY WRESTLING SO POPULAR YOU KNOWIT'S A MORE POPULAR THAN IT'S EVER BEEN YE THAT'S INTERESTING THINGS LIKE YOU AVE SEE CAN GLADIATOR LIKE OCTAGON FIGHTS AND WRESTLING ARE INCREASING IN POPULARITY DESPITE THE FACT THAT SUPPOSE LE WERE REVOLVING SO ADDING AT REFLECT SOMETHING BOTH PRIMITIVE AND EVOLVED ABOUT THE HUMAN BRANG YES MY PRIMITIVE IN THE SENSE THAT YETHER SOME VIOLENCE IT'S PHYSICAL THAT'S DOWN IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS AS WE'D SAY NIT SCRATCHES THAT MICH BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROTECTING EACH OTHER THEU WIT SCRATCHES THAT ITCH OF SEEING THE GLADIATORS BUT IT'S LIKE WATCHING A MOVI YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THEY'RE NOT REALLYSS THEY'RE NOT REALLY HURTING EACH OTHER THEY GET HURT BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE THINGS THYRE DOING ARE SO CRAZY I THINK IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO THOROUGHLY ENJOY WRSTLING ONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE UP NARRATIVE DISTTENSING JUST A LITTLE BIT MY NARRATIVE DISTANCING IS THIS SENSE THAT THIS IS A STORY IT'S A MOVY IT'S NOT REAL BUT THERE WERE MOMENTS LIKE YESTERDAY THAT THE JUMP OFF THE TOP ROPE ON TO THE GUY WHO SPLAYED OUT ON THE LATTER THE LATTER BREAKS THIS WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US IT COULDN'T HAVE FELT GOOD NO HE WALKED AWAY HE SEEMED FINE A ISH BUT THAT AND THEN AM THERE WAS A MATCH BETWEEN TWO WOMEN WHERE WOMEN PUT A METAL PLATE INTO HER A INTO THE BOTTOMS OF HER SUIT IN THEN RAN ON THAN JUMPED ON TO THE OTHER WOMEN AND YOU HID HER WITH THE METAL PLATE IN THE THE METAL PLATE KIND OF SLIPPED OUT SHE WAS WALKING ROUND AND EVERYONE KNEW SHE HAD SHETED CAUSE YOU'RE NOT SPA SEE IS THE METL PLATE BUT SO SORT OF EXCITING CAUSE SHE HAD DONE IT EXCITING CASHEAD GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT AND AT THE SAME TIME EXCITING UPSETTING THAT THE REFERI SAW IT BUT THEN DIDN'T CALL IT ANDTHIS IS LIKE TWITTER AX THIS AS LING LIKE IN STER DAM THIS IS LIKE POLITICS THIS I LIKE THIS S RELUCK RIGHT LIKE SEEING PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH THINGS THIS SO FRUSTRATING WITH E FEELATION  THAT'S ALL PART OF IT IT'S E I'VE GOT IT IT'S VERY A ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD WF IT I'VE I'M IT'S T'S WHERE ECAUSE I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I'D BE HUCKED IOT LIKE ARCHERY AND PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING NOW LIKE ON OF YOU BUSY GUY AND TWENTY FOUR I'M MAN TO COME BACK TO THIS VERY PRACTICAL QUESTION AND ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION FIRST THERE AR FEW COMMENTS IN HERE THAT ARE JUST PRICELESS BY THE WAY 'SDON'T WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOUREO PICEES AND SO ASINSTINE COUPLE OF HISTORICAL QUESTIONS I KNOW YOU'RE NOT BIG ON ANSWERING HISTORICAL QUESTIONS AM NECESSARILY MAYBE YOU ARE BUT I CAN'T HELP EVERY TIME I SEE YOU ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT THE ROMONTS ORE ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT JOSTROMER BUT I I LIKE THIS QUESTION FIRST OF ALL IT STARTS OFF I LOVE RICK REUBEN HE'S SO FASCINATING THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT START THAT WAY ON THE POD CAST AT YOU DID WITH JO ROGAN I YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH JOHNNY CASH AND SEE HIM IN A NEW LIGHT AFTER DOING INTERVIEWS FOR A BOOK ABOUT JOHNNY ORSOMETHING LIKE THAT IM THE QUESTION THIS PERSON ASKED WAS FROM YOUR PRESENT VIEW WHAT WAS THE MOST IMPACKFUL MOMENT OR MOMENTS FROM BEING WITH HIM IN WORKING WITH HIM OR SIMPLY DO YOU RECALL A MOMENT WORK IN WA JOHNNY CASH THAT YOU PARTICULARLY ENJOYED I ENJOYNED ANY TIME I GOT SPEND TIME WITH THEM HE WAS REALLY SOL FUL SERIOUS SHY QUIET MAN INCREDIBLY KNOWLEDGABLE YOU KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HISTORY AND AD SO MUCH ABOUT MUSIC HO KNEW EVERY SONG HE DIDN'T HEE MEAN NOT OF KNOWN MODERN SONCE BUT HE KNEW THE HISTORY OF MUSIC AM REALLY WELL AND THERE WAS JUST A HUMBLE IMASTY ABOUT HIM THAT CAME THROUGH I THINK THAT THE STRENGTH OF HIM AS AN ARTIST WAS WHEN HE SAID WORDS EVEN IF HE DIDN'T WRITE THE WORDS IF HE TOLD A STORY IN WORDS YOU BELIEVE THAT STORY SO HE HAD  A CREDIBLE GRAVITAS AND UM HE WAS GREAT BECAUSE OF WHO HE WAS IT WASN'T HIS ABILITY IS A SINGER IT WASN'T HIS ABILITY AS A SONG WRITER ALTHOUGH HE WAS A GREAT SONG WRIHTER AND HE WAS A GREAT SINGER BUT THAT'S NOT WHY HE WAS JOHNNY CASH WHO WAS JONNY CASH BECAUSE OF THE HUMAN BEING UNDERNEATH AND ANYTHING THAT THAT I WOULD HAVE DONE WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH OF A BEEM OF LIGHT HE WAS ON THE PLANET IT JUST HAPPEN TO BE MUSIC JUST HAPPEN TO BE MUSIC ALLOF THAT ONE QUESTION THAT CAME UP A LOT AND I I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WHICH IS HOW DOES ONE CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AN WORKING ON IS WORTH THAT AND I THINK HERE WE HAVE TO DEFIND WORSH THAT BEUM AND WE CAN DOFIND ANY NUMBER OF WAYS BUT I THINK THIS IS A FEELING THAT I HER PEOPLE EXPRESS A LOT LIKE HOW DO I KNOW IF OM ON THE RIGHT PATH AND I JUST ONE REMIND YOU'RE EARLIER ANSWER THAT YOUYOU'RE PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH UNCERTAINTY THIS AND THE UNKNOWN AND I THINK THAT'S A RARE TRAIT THE QUESTION OF WORTH IT IS RELYANT ON AN OUTCOME WE DON'T MAKE THESE THINGS FOR AN OUTCOME IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT THE MIND SET TO MAKE SOMETHING GREAT THAT OUTCOME HAPPENS YOU'RE MAKING THE BEST THING YOU CAN MAKE IT'S A IT'S A DEVOTIONAL PRACTICE WHATEVER HAPPENS AFTER THAT HAPPENS AND THAT PART THAT HAPPENS AFTER IT IS COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR CONTROL PUTTING ANY ENERGY INTO THAT PART THAT'S OUT OF YOUR CONTROL S WASTED TIME ALL IT IS ALL IT DOES IS UNDER MY NEWR WORK YOUR WORK IS TO MAKE THE BEST THING HOU CAN SO ANY THOUGHT YOU HAVE ABOUT OUTCOME UNDERMINES THE WHOLE THING LET THAT ONE SINK IN AN THAT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR AND I'LL SAY IT'S SO CAY TO THINK ABOUT OUTCOME AFTER YOU'VE FINISHED THE THING YOU'RE MAKING ONCE YOU'VE MADE IT THEN YOU CAN SAY HM WHAT CAN I DO TO TURN PEOPLE ON TO THIS BUT IN THE MAKING OF IT IT'S PREMATURE WHICH BRINGS MY MIND BACK TO THAT DIARY ENTRY LIKE APPROACH BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO A DIARY ENTRY IF YOU LIE TO YOURSELF YOU'RE GOIN TO GET A LOT LESS OUT OF IT IT'S I'S A RIDICULOUS IDEA LYING IN YOUR DIARY AND ITS IS IS WELL IT'S SO INTERTING AS WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO DO REALLY GOOD SCIENCE AND I WAS FORTUNATE TO WORK WITH SOME ONE WHO WAS TRULY COMMITTED TO THE TRUTH AND ACCURACY SHE IS JUST SAY WHENEVER THERE WAS A SCANDAL PUBLISH LIKE SOME ONE FABRICATED DAY TAS YUS LIKE THIS IS O CRAZY LIKE OUT LIKE WHY WOULD YOU GET INTO SCIENC YOU BE BF YOU WANT TO MAKES E AARP OU U THE AT ER OFF GOING TO SOMETHING ELSO CLEARLY THEY WEREN'T THOSE PEOPLE WHO MAKE UP DATA WERE NOT IN SCIENCE FOR DISCOVERY OF TRUTH AS BEST WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT THEY WERE INTO IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE BUT'S THE SAME WAY YOU DO YOU FORMULATE QUESTION THAN A HYPOTHESIS AND THEN YOU JUST GO SEE WHAT IS AN WHAT ISN'T AND THEN AFTERWARDS YOU DECIDE WELL AS THIS A PAPER THAT SEND TO A TOP JOURNAL OR A MEDIOCRE JOURNAL THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE OUTCOME TO US VERY SOMEWHARE EXACTLY THE SAME AND AND IT YOU'LL SEE IT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF LIFE BEYOND ART IT'S IT'S I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS HIT WAS INTERESTING THAT CAME UP IN WRITING THE BOOK IS IT STARTED BEING ABOUT ART AND I CAME TO REALIZE AS I WAS PUTTING THE IDEAS TOGETHER THAT IT' SEEMS LIKE REGARDLESS AF WHAT YOU DO IN LIFE IF YOU FOLLOW THESE PRINCIPLES YOU'R LIFE WILL PROBABLY IMPROFE YOU PROBABLY BE A BETTER HUSBAND OR BETTER FATHER OR BETTER WHATEVER IT IS IT'S SUM IT SEEMS LIKE THE THE ART IS AN OUTGROWTH OF A'S WHY THE SUBTITLESS A WAY OF BEING 'S LIKE YOU CREATE YOU'RSELF IN THE WAY IN THE WORLD WHERE THE THINGS THAT YOU MAKE OR TAPPED IN SOMETHING DEEP BUT THAT COMES FROM YOU BEING TAPPED INTO SOMETHING BE VHENCE OUT WORKS SO TAPPING INTOSELF GROWNING ITSELF NOT THINKING ABOUT OUTCOME DIARY ENTRY LIKE APPROACH TO CREATING STUFF SEEMS TO BE THE AND I THINK ONE THING ELSE I'LL SAY TEX THEY SAY TAPPING INTO SELF IT DOESN'T COME FROM THE SELF BUT YOU'VE TO TAPPINTO YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU'RE THE VESSEL TO ALLOW IT TO COME OUT EVERYTHING IN THE VESSELS COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT YOU'RE CREATION YOU'RE THE UM IT'S LIKE YOU'RE THE SCULPTOR OR THE YOU'RE THE DATA AN ANALYST WEARE TAKING THESE THINGS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES THAT YOU'VE NOTICED SOMETHINGS THAT YOU'VE NOTICE SOMETHINGS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'VE NOTICED BUT YOU DID YOU KNOW ICS HOW WE LEARND IN A WEK TAKIN A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WE'RE TAKING IN BUT THE WAY WE CAN TAKE THESE DATAPOINTS THAT ARE INSIDE OF US THAT CAME FROM OUTSIDE OF US AND CREATE A CONSTELLATION THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE ARTIST JOB IS BUT ALSO THAT'S WHAT WE ALL DO ALL THE TIME AND TO GET BETTER AT IT IT'S GETTING MOREINTUNE WITH YOURSELF AND OPENING YOURSELF TO THINGS OUTSIDE OF UM I'LL SAY IF YOU HAVE A NARROW BELIEF SYSTEM YOU'LL HAVE LESS INFORMATION TO TO WORK WITH LESS TAT POINTS SO BEING OPEN MINDED AND AM ALLOWING SURPRISE TO BE SURPRISED HOLDING ALL F YOUR BELIEFS VERY LOOSELY IT'S INTERTING BECAUSE IT THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THIS AND FROM KNOWING YOU AS WELL IT SEEMS THAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS BEST SERVED BY HAVING REALLY GOOD BOUNDARIES LIKE NOT GETTING I'M FOGGY ABOUT WHAT'S ABOUT YOU AND WHAT'S ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE OR ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT OR THE WORLD WANTS BUT ALSO HAVING REALLY GOOD ANTENI AND BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD YOU CAN'T BE CLOISTERED AND AND LIKE THIS NO UM BUT PART OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS FEELS HAND LOOKS LIKE YOU'R YOU'RE IN E'RE IN A TUNNEL BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO BRING INFROM THE OUTSIDE I' MEAN THE IM SO IT SEEMS LIKE MAKING THESE TWO SEPARATE COMPARTMENTS THAT YOU CAN BRIDGE IM SEEMS IMPORTANT AND HEALTHY IVEING HERE AS YOU MENTION IT'S A WAY OF BEING IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CREATING THINGS THAT'S ALSO A HEALTHY WAY TO BE IN THE WORLD BECAUSE IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY GETTING PULLED AROUND BY EVERYTHING EMOTIONALLY IN THINGS ARE UPSETTING THAT'S NOT GOOD BUT IF YOU'RE JUST CUT OFF FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT GOOD EITHER DO YOU CULTIVATE THAT WAY OF BEING THROUGH THESE PRACTICES IM OR DO YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY YOU'RE WIRE THAT YOU YOU STARTED OFF THAT WAY WAS NATURAL TO ME IF YOELS NATURAL TO ME AND I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I THOUGHT I WOULD LIVE IN NEW YORK CITYI MY WHOLE LIFE AND THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I FELT LIKE HAVING THAT ENERGY AND NOISE AROUND ME FELT GOOD NOW I FEEL BEST IN THE JUNGLE OR THE FIREST I DIDN'T DECIDE THAT HAVIN'T DECIDE WHAT FEELS GOOD YOU KNOWING IT JUST HAPPEN S YOU'RE CLEARLY WILLING TO UPDATE AND ADAPT CHANGE HAR NUTRITIAN CHANGE HERE ALACITY CHANGE OU THE WAY YOU FEEL NEW INFORMATION UPDATE LOF IT YOU'RE SCIENTIST E I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING IIAGAIN WE START WITH I KNOW NOTHING WE ALL KNOW NOTHING SO IF SOMETHING SOUNDS INTERESTING WORTH TRYING I'LL TRY IT SE DOES AT WORK DOES IT NOT WORK YOU KNOW I THOUGHT AT ONE POINT IN TIME I THOUGHT VIGANISM WAS A GOOD IDEA I WAS EXCITED ABOUT IT AND I DID IT FOR A LONG TIME I DIDN'T GET THE RESULSE I WAS HOPING FOR I DIDN'T HAVE BETTER HELT ID MUCH WORSE HELF I HAD YOU KNOW A TREMENDOUS AMAN I WET GAIN AN A I WAS VERY ILL THROUGH THAT DIET I DIDN'T MY INTENTIONS WERE GOOD HOW DO YOU APPROACH RESISTANCE ESPECIALLY RESISTANCE IN OTHER ARTISTS YOU WORK WITH YOU DON'T PRESENTLY PEOPLE HIRE YOU THAT THEY WANT A WORK WITH YOU THEY THEY DO ON A WORK WITH YOU BUT I THINK WHAT THE PERSON IS ASKING HERE IS IF SOMEBODY YOU'RE WORKING WITH IS STOCK LIKE THEIR STOCK DIDO YOU ASKED THEM TO THINK DO YOU ASKED THEM TO FEEL OU ASKED THEM TO TAKE A DAY OFF DO YOU I DO A DENIS RODMAN ON THEM AND SEND THEM TO THAGUEST A PARTY FOR A COUPLE DAYS CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKED FOR DENIS I INDO YOU LEAVE ON THEM ALONE LET THEM COME TO YOU I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THOSE SORTS OF INTERACTIONS ARE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS THE CASE BY CASE SITUATION IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE ARTISTS DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION AND A AND USUALLY BY THE TIME THAT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER ANY RESISTANCE THEY HAD IN THE PAST HAS ALREADY BEEN OVERCOME USUALLY WE I'M TOGETHER WITH SOME ONE WHO WERE WE MAKE A TEEM WITH THE IDEA OF MAKING THE BEST THING WE POSSIBLY CAN AND WE'LL BOTH DO ANYTHING WE CANT ABOUT THING TO BE THE BEST  IT CAN BE WE'RE PASS THE RESISTANCE I KNOWS YOUS REMAIN FRIENDS OF THE LOT OF THE PEOPLE YOU'VE WORKED WITH WHICH IS A GREAT TESTAMENT TO YOU AND YOUR WORK AND WHO YOU ARE IT'S WONE TO MENTION THAT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE FOLKS WITH THA OTHER PRODUCER ARTISTS RELATIONSHIPS IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT A PRACTICAL QUESTION BUT I THINK ONE THAT UM IS I'S WORTH ASKING IS AH DO YOU HANDLE THE FINANCES AROUND YOUR WORK WITH ARTIS SEED YOU HAVE SOME ONE ELSE DO LIKE NEGOTIATIONS AND ALL OF THAT KIND IS HONESTLY OF NO IDEA  WORKS AT NOCLUE IT'S SEE EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GET DONE BUT I HAVE NO IDEA IN TH INNER WORKINGS OF ANY OF IT I TRY TO I TRY TO STAY OUT OF IS MUCH UM IF IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING THE BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE MOMENT I DON'T REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH I DONT WANT O BE INVOLVE THAT ASPECT AS INTERESTING WHEN I WAS VISITING E THE SUMMER WE HAD A REALLY DELIGHTFUL DINNER CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF YOUR OTHER GUESTS AND AT ONE POINT PROUDLY DUE TO ME FRANKLY THE CONVERSATION VEARED A BIT INTO THE BUSINESS REALM AND I'LL NEVER FORGET YE SAID IN A VERY POLITE WAY THAT DIDN'T FEEL DISMISSIVE AT ALL YOU SAID LET'S TALK ABOUT ART INSTEAD RIGHT LIKE ENOUGH ABOUT BUSINESS LESS TALK ABOUT ART INSEAD AND AND IN THAT MOMENT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT WELL I GLEAND A LOT OF GEMS FROM THAT VISIT IM I WASN'T THERE TO STUDY YOU OS THERE TO HANG OUT WITH YOU BUT I GLEAN SO MANY GEMS TREADING WATER IN THE POOL SOME OF THE OTHER PRACTIIS WILL TALK ABOUT BUT REMEMBER THAT AND I THINK ABOUT THAT IN MYSELF A LOT IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW THE EMALES AND THINGS COMING IN AND THEN I THINK MY PURPOSE IN LIFE AT THIS POINT OF MY LIFE IS TOO COLLECT ORGANIZE AND DISSEMINATE HEALTH AND SCIENCE INFORMATION SO THAT FOR ME IS ART IN THE SENSE AND ANYTHING ELSE FEELS KIND OF SO ONE ELSE CAN DO THAT RIGHT SN ELSE  T YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR GIFT AND THAT YOU CAN TAKE COMPLICATED SCIENTIFIC IDEAS AND EXPLAIN THEM IN A WAY THAT ALL OF US WO'RE NOT SCIENTISTS ER NOT UM MEDICAL STUDENTS CAN UNDERSTAND AND IT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND YOU DO IT IN A KIND AND LIVING WAY WHERE WE GET THE SENSE THAT YOU CARE THAT WE UNDERSTAND YOU EXPLAIN IT WAY THAT THEE'S A A A CARE IN IT THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO US SO THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR TEACHING THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE WORDS THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT IS INDEED WAT IT IS FROM MY WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THE INFORMATION BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO COOL AND SO IMPORTANT AND THEY NEED THE INFORMATION AND IT'S

I'M JUST INADEJA ALLMAN A DUSTEJAND I'M AN AUTE LISTEN TO ANYTHING I CAN THINK OF THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT HAVEN'T HEARD THE TALKING HEADS ON WHILIST LISTEN THE TALKINGHEADS JUST HOW GREAT THAT THAT FREEDOM IS TO HAVE EVERYTHING AT YOUR FINGER TIPS AND WHEN I CAME TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY IS I DON'T WANT A DEJAY ALL DAY I LOVE THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY DO DEJAY ALL DAY I LOVE THAT WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING I WANTE HERE I CAN FIND IT BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAFE DO DO THE WORK OF PICKING EVERYTHING I'M IN A LISTEN TO I LIKE BEING PROGRAMME TO AND I LIKE THE DISCOVERY OF SOMEBODY ELSE PLAYING SOMETHING THAT I WASN'T EXPECTING AND GETTING TO ENJOY THAT SO NOW I'D DO MORE LISTENING TO EITHER SOMEBODY'S CURATED PLAYLISTS OR ONLINE RADIO STATIONS AND I DO LESS PICKING MUSIC TO LISTEN TO BUT I NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT BEFORE BECAUSE I WAS THOUGHT WELL IF I CAN LISTEN ANYTHING I WANT I WANT T LISTEN WHAT I WANT TO LISTEN TO I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I DIDN'T WANT A HAVE TO PICK IT I LOVE TH E RARE LIE VERSIONS AND IM BESIDES AND WHATEVER ZEESIDES THAT ONE CAN FIND ON YOU TOO LIKE THE OTHER DAY YOU SENT ME JUST AT RANDOM A A CLIP FROM MY THING WAS A JAPANESE TELL VISION SHOW WITH THE REMONS OPENING UP IM AND JOHNNY OPENS UP WITH YOU LOW MOUBABY YOU BER SHUT UP AND THEN THEY THEY DIVE IN ABALON AND I IT'S THE SONG I CULD HAVE HEARD ANYWHERE ELSE BUT IT WAS THE FACT THAT IT WAS SHOT FROM ABOVE THAT IT WAS BLACK AND WHITE AND THAT HE ADDS THIS LITWLE RIFF AT THE BEGINNING YOU LOW MOUBABY BUT SHUT UP AND THEN JUST DIVES INTO IT THAT MADE IT FOR ME AS A HUGE REMONS FAN ELSE I YT LIKE YOU KNOW THINK I DID THAT IN MY KITCHEN YET LIKE YOU SO HIPE BECAUSE WHEN YOU GOING JUST LISTEN TO A SONG THAT'S RECORD AS PART OF AN ALBAM YOU'RE NOT CAN TO GET THOSE ADDITIONAL PIECES BACK IN THE DAY AND STILL NOW IFYOU WENT TO A LIVE SHOW YOU MIGHT SEE THAT AND HEAR THAT NEVER FORGET THAT BUT IN THAT SENSE TO ME YOU TOO AND AND THE ARNAS LIKE WA LIKE IT'S THI ART ARK HIVE OF JEMS THAT IOUT TENTIALLY HAVE BEEN THERE MAYBE OF SEVENTY I WOULD BEE FOUR YEARS OLD AND SO YOU KNOW IM AND WY THINKS FOR SENDING ME THAT CLEB LOVED IT CAUE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THE REMONS BUT IM THINKGS LIKE THAT I JUST THINK OT THA INTERNET IS JUST AMAZEING AND SO SPECTLAGULAR AND THE AMOUNTELECTURES YOU COULD FIND ON YOU TO UNBELIEVABLE THE THE GREATEST THINKERS IN THE WORLD I WANT I DON'T WONT TO SAY OURE ON YOU TO BECAUSE THEY POBEING POST ON YOU TO BUT THEIR MATERIAL THIS OGT YOU DO AND IT'S UNBELIEVABLE YOU KNOW THINGS FROM OLD FILMS FROM FIFTIES AND SIXTIES IT'S ALL ON YOU TO I BEEN LESSING A BIBLE INTERPRETATION ON YOU TOO AND THERE'S JUST IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS AND EVER PERSPECTIVES AND I WOULD HAVE NEVER FOUND THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE ALEARNDING TAINGS PLEASED THE ATHER SO GOOD I'M I'M TRIN OF WORK THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT START TO FINISH NOW AS A AS A LEARNING IN A PRACTICE AND WELL O CASE SO THE QUESTION WAS AURE SMART PHONES THE CHAINS THAT BIND US AND PREVENT OUR CREATIVITY IM BUT I THINK YOU ANSWERD THAT IT'S BOTH A UM AROCKET SHIP TO CREATIVITY ANA AND AND CHAINS TO THE GROUND AND IT'S LIKE ALL OTHER TOOLS LIKE THE TOOLSTON'T MAKE OR BREAK YOUR ART IT'S JUST IT'S ANOTHER TOOL YOU CAN USE IT FOR MIS USEIT SOME ONE WANTED TO KNOW AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE ANY RECURRING DREAMS AND WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON DREAMS AND DREAMING IN GENERAL DO YOU WRITE DOWN YOUR DREAMS TO YOU SPEND TIME I'VE THINK ONG ABOUT THEM I'VE GONE THROUGH PHASES OF MY LIFE RAVE WRITTEN DOWN DREAMS I'M NOT DOING IT RIGHT NOW UM I THINK WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM FROM WRITING OUR DREAMS I CAN NOT TO ANALYZED THEM IN THE MOMENT BUT I'VE NOTICED WHEN I'VE KEPT A DREAM JOURNAL AND LOOKED AT YEARS LATER TE SERE EL THINGS THAT MADE NO SENSE WERE ALL SAME THE SAME THING AND THEY WERE LL VERY CLEAR BASED ON MY LIFE EXPERIENCE AT THAT TIME SO GIVES US CLUSE AS TO UM WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON THE WE ARE SUBCONSCIOUS IS EXPERIENCING OUR LIVES IT'S GIVING US I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL THEM POINTERS U REFLECTIONS MAY BE BE BETTER WORD OUR MUTUAL FRIEND PAUL CONTY UM BELIEVES THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS OR SUBCONSCIOUS U BOTH USED INTERCHANGEABLY IS THE SUPERCOMPUTER OF THE HUMAN BRAIN THAT THE MISCONCEPTION IS THAT THE FOREBRAIN WHICH IS INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND CONSTAXT AND ANTISCIPATION OF OUTCOMES ET CETERA PEOPLE THINK THAT'S THE SUPERCOMPUTER BUT THAT THE SUPERCOMPETER S THE UNCONSCIOUS THAT'S PAUL'S BELIEF HES STATED THAT VERY CLEARLY ON THES SPOTCAST AND ELSEWHERE AND HE BELIEVES THAT IN DREAMS THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS CONTROLLING MORE OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BUT ALSO THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO TEACH US THINGS IN THE WAY THAT WE LEARN BEST SO THAT MY DREAMS FOR INSTANCE ARE ALL ANALOGIES CAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IF PEOPLE LISTEN AN HE TALK ON THE POTAS I OFTEN WE USE ANALOGY A AND OR VERY VISUAL SO WILL PRESENT THINGS TO ME IN VISUAL SYMBOLS SO PAUL SAID INTERMS OF DREAM INTERPRETATION THAT WE WOULD ALL BE WISE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE LEARN BEST AND OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS TRYING TO TOSS US THINGS IN DREAMS TO UM EXPLAIN THINGS IN THE WAY THAT WE LEARN I MAKE SENSE AND I WOULD SAY ALSO UNCONSCIOUS AND OUR INSTINCT THE WAY WE ACT INSTINCTUALLY IS A REFLECTION OF OUR UNCONSCIOUS AND AS ARTIST THAT'S A TAPPING INTO THAT THE INSTINCT AND UNCONSCIOUS IS WERE THE GREAT IDEAS ARE AND THEN THINGS THAT COME FROM OUR U INTELLECTUALSELVES ARE ARE MUCH LESS THERE THEY HAVE MUCH LESS OF A CHARGE THEY'RE MUCH SMALLER IDEAS  I THINK THE AD THAT THE CONSCIOUS MIND AND THE INTELLECTUAL MIND AS YE HERE CALLING IT ARE BOUND TO OUTCOME IN A BIG WAY I'M AN INJECTOD A QUESTION OF MY OWN UM I'M FASCINATED BY THE WAY YOU'VE DISCUSED PEOPLE'S REAL UNDERLYING MOTIV ATIENCE AND HOW THAT SHAPES THERE CREATIVE PROCESS BUT ALSO THEIR CAREER UM IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK ALO BIT ABOUT THE STORY OF ANDREWDISE CLAY THAT'S THE STORY THAT TO ME CAPTURES IT BEST UM ENDUDICE CLAY A WAS A AA COMMEDIAN WHO TOLD REALLY OFFENSEIV JOKES AND IS AUDIENCE LEVEDEM FOR IT BUT THE PEOPLE WHO WARRENT HIS AUDIENCE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT ND THEY VILLIFIED E AND HE BECAME A COMEDIAN BECAUSE HE WANTO PEOPLE TO LOVE HIM HE DIDN'T BECOME A COMDIAN TO HURT ANYBODY HE WANTED O ENTERTAIN PEOPLE AND WHILE HE WAS PLAYING TO YOU KNOW SOLD OUT MADISON SQUARE GARDENS FULL OF PEOPLE NEWSPAPERS WOULD WRITE TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT HIM AND IT REALLY GOC TO HIM AND HE DECIDED TO CHANGE HIS ARTISTIC OUTPUT TO TRY TO MAKE THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE HIM LIKE HIM AND WHEN HE DID THAT IT UNDERMIND HIS WHOLE GIFT AND IT JUST IT SEEMED LIKE THINGS FELL APART I THINK HE'S IN A BETTER PLACE NOW I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN A WHILE BUT I THINK HE'S IN A BETTER PLACE NOW AND HE'S BACK TO A CARING LESS ABOUT THE REACTION AND IN TURND GETTING A BETTERY ACTION  IM BECAUSE HE'S BEING PURE IN WHAT HE THINKS IS FUNNY I LIKED HIM VERY MUCH IN FACT I THOUGHT HE DID A SPECTACULAR JOB AS PLAYING UM THE FEMALE ARTIST'S FATHER IN A STAR IS BORN GENTLY GOGON IM BRAGCOOP E A REALLY GOOD ACTOR IS GREAT ACTOR WWAT I REALLY LIKE THE STORY ABOUT HIM BECAUSE IT INCAPSOLATE SO MUCH THAT IF PEOPLE CAN THINK ABOUT WHY THEY DO WHAT THEY DO THEY ARE GAN AVOID PITFALSE I POTENTIALLY UM BUT HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD SPEND INTROSPECTING ABOUT WHAT MAKES THEM TAKE AND WHY THEY WANT TO ENTERTAIN OR MAKE JOKES SIR M I DON'T THINK IT'S SO ONE SISEITSI KNOW' NOW THAT I COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS IT TRUE THAT ADROCH AND COURAGE YOU TO GIVE ELLAL COOL JAY A CHANCE YES THAT IS TRUE ADROCH HEARD THE DEMOTATE AND INSISTED THAT I LISTEN TO IT WAT OF THAT THIS IS A KIND OF GENERIC QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S GOOD TO PUT THESE IN EVERYONCE IN A WHILE UM WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO A STARTING COMEDIAN HE NOT THES OF THE THE SORT OF LIKE AS I I WAYS THING THE'S LIKE I YOU KNOW SOPHOMORE AND HIGH SCHOOL KIND I QUESTION BUT THAT DOESN'T MAS SILLY MEAN THEIR BAD IN SOME SENSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SUCH A GREAT QUESTION LIKE WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE BE TO A STARTING COMEDIAN BE TREA TO YOURSELF AR NOT TO LISTEN TO ANY ONE THERE YEU GO UM HE'LL BE A GREAT BOOK AXCEPT TO BE A VERY SHORT BOOK BUTTER O MALSO MAKE IT VERY GREAT BU IM WOK COULD BE A BLANK A JUST PUT ALL E THINGS THAT YOU WANT A PUT IN IT AND I WORKIN ON A BOOK NOW AN I'LL TELL YOU IT'S HART BY THE WAY I ASKED RICK FOR ADVICE ABOUT BOOKWRITING IM BECAUSE I'M TBEEN TRYING TO WITE THIS BOOK FOR A WHILE AND AND HE GAVE ME THIS THE FALLING ADVICE SO'M INJACKIN MY OWN QUESTION HE SAID THE SOONER YOU CAN GET TO A COMPLETE DRAGHT THAT YOU'RE HAPPY WITH OR HAPPIISH WITH THE BETTER THE PROCESS WILL GO SO I'M WORKING ON GETTING THAT COMPLETE DRAUGT I WOULD SAY DON'T FOCUS TOO MUCH ON ANY THE INDIVIDUAL DETAILS UNSO YOU HAVE THE WHOLE THING DOWN MAN YOU CAN FOCUS ON ALL MAKING EVERYTHING BETTER THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE BETTER DON'T GET OG DOUND IN THAT AT THE EXPENSE OF GETTING THROUGH THE PROJECT YOUR ADVICE HAS REALLY BEEN HELPING ME BY THEGH AY DOING IT LIK DIARY ENTRY SGREAT I KNOW AND I'VE KEPT A DIARY FOR MANY YEARS SO THAT SOMEWHAT NATURAL TELL ME LITTLE BIT ABACK DIRIINTRIS HOW LONG HOW LONG IS THE DIRY SURE YEO IM A DIARY ENTRY IS ANYWHERE FROM I ONE TO EIGHT HAND WRITTEN PAGES SINGLE LINE SPACING GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ESI START IN ALL CAPITALS AND THEN SWHICH OVER TO CURSE IVE AS I SPEED UP I'VE BEEN DOING THAT SINCE GOSHON'S HIGH SCHOOL I'VE GOT A  DRAWER FILLED WITH THEM DATED IN EVERYTHING AND IM IT'S USUALLY A PROCESS AF JUST TRYING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF MY SYSTEM THAT I FEELS IS LIKE CLOGGING ME SOME FRUSTRATION WIT THE OUTSIDE WORLD BUT IT SOME TIMES LIKE THIS MORNING I JOURNAL A IN THE ROOM BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP AND I JUST WAS LIKE THING OSE RITING HIGH OFF R ESTLING LAST NIGHT I WAS MARVELLING HOUSE SIMILAR  THE GREAT EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE AR NOW AS THEY WORKED IT EVERY OTHER STAGE IN MY LIFE IN THE SENSE THAT THEY GIVE ME THIS FEELING OF LIKE UGUET LIKE THEIRE THESE GEMS AND I'M AND OF PEOPLE YOU AND OTHERS AND EXPERIENCES AND I'M FINDING THEM LIKE I'M EXPERIENCING THEM AND REMINDING MYSELF THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE LONG PERIODS IN BETWEEN THOSE MOMENTS WHERE THINGS FEEL KINA LIKE NOT EMPTY CERTAINLY NOT EMPTY BUT E CIM FRUSTRATING IN THE SENSE THAT LIKE A'M BUSY AND I'M DEALING WITH A MUNCH OF THINGS AND THINGS DON'T FEEL SMOOTH AND IM BUT I'VE BEN THROUGH ENOUGH FOR THESE CYCLES THAT I JUST IT IN REALLY LEARNING TO ENJOY THE CYCLES AND THAT WAS IT AND  I AND I THINK THE LAST LINE IN MY ENTRY WITH SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW IN IT YOU KNOW AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE OR SOMETHING SO THIS SMORNING IS JUST A VERY POSIVE ENTRY BUT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW IV BEN THERE DEUFTULY SOME TEARSTAINED ENTRIES AND THERE DUFFULLY COME ENTRIES WHERE I'M JUST SO PEST I CAN BARELY GET THE WRITING OUT BUT IT'S IT'S A PROCESS OVE LIKE GETTING THAT STUFF OUT SO THTHAN I CAN LEAN IN TO THE DAY DO YOU EVER GO BACK AND LOOK AT THEM I DID THE OTHER DAY BECAUSE I RECORDIG AN EPISODE ON A VERY PARTICULAR TYPE OF JOURNALING THAT SUPPORTED BY OVER TWO HUNDRED PUREREVIEED STUDIES WHICH IS CALLED EXPRESSIVE WRITING I CAN TLL YOU ABOUT IT I CAN'T READOR EIT'S A PROCESS THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY JAMES PENNABAKER WHO IS A PROFESSOR UNIVERSIY ATTECTAS AUSTIN AND HE HAD HIS STUDENTS RIT AS PART OF AN EXPERIMENT FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES A DAY FOR JUST FOUR DAYS ITHER CONSECUTIVE DAYS OR A WEEK APART BUT ABOUT THE SAME THING AND THE THING THAT THEY'RESP ST TO WRITE ABOUT AS THE MOST CHALLENGING UPSETTING OR EVEN TROMATIZING EXPERIENCE OF THEIR LIFE AND IT SHOWS THAT THE DATA FROM OVER TWO HUNDRED STUDIES SHOW INCREDIBLE POSITIVE SHIFTS IN PSYCHOLOGY PHYSIOLOGY IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND ABILITY TO COMBAT INFECTIONS I WAS SO STRUCK BY THE DATA FROM THIS WORK THAT I DECIDE TO DERDICATE A WHOLE PODCAST EPISODE TO IT IT' PROBABBY OUT BY TIME A'M THIS EPISODE AIRS BUT AM I HAVEN'T DONE THAT ONE YET I'MAN TO DO IT IT'S LITTLE BIT OF A HIER BIR OF ENTRY CAUSE I' LIKE O CLMN I HEARE THAT THE FIRST DAY ESPECIALLY AS PRETTY UPSETTING CAUSE YOU'RE PURPOSELY PICKING SOMETHING REALLY HARD BUT AM YE BUT MOST OF THE JOURNALLY I DO IS JUST KIND OF DIARY LIKE HEARS WHATD HAPPEN HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON AND MY BIGGEST FEARS THAT SOMEBODY WOULD FIND THEM BUT IN PREPARATION FOR THAT EPISODE ABOUT PEN OBAKER I WENT AND LOOK TO MY JOURNALS AND SLIKE WHAT DO I WRITE ABOUT AND I REALIZE THEIR PRETTY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL I'M SOMETIMES ABOUT TROUBLING THINGS BUT NEVER BEFORE HAD I WRITTEN FOUR TIMES IN A ROW ABOUT THE EXACT SYMPATHY INTERESTING NOW TH PENOBAKER IVE THINK DESERVES A NOABLE PRIZE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATE ON THIS COMPARED TO AND I'M NOT DISPARAGING PESCRIPTION DRUGS PERSAY BUT LIKE ACCESSOR EYES FOR DEPRESSION IT'S LIKE AT LEAST AS GOOD A TREATMENT S LIKE ZERO COST STUFF BUT IT YOU KNOW AND AND ON AN ON YOU DON'T WTTO BE CAREFUL LST ARE GIVENG THE PODCAST AGAIN NOW THERE WERE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT QUOTEN QUOTE ENTERTAINMENT AND MUSIC INDUSTRY NONE OF WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WERE PARTICULARLY COMPLIMENTARY OF QUOTE THE INDUSTRY AND I THINK THE SYST SOMETHING THAT COMES A BLOT BECAUSE PEOPLE OFTEN FOCUSS ON THE MARKETING THE PERSONALITIES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE SO PLEASANT AT TIMES I'M SURE THEIR TN PLEASANT PERSONALITIES IN THE INDUSTRY TO BUT THE QUESTION IS THIS HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE AND THESE ARE THEIR WORDS ZOLE CRUSHING ANTI CREATIVE ASPECTS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND HOLD ON TO THAT SENSE OF CREATIVITY AND LOVE FOR THE WORK I'M JUST FOCUST INE THE WORK I DON'T THINK OF MYSELFAS PART OF THE EM THE ENTERTAINMENT INDESTRIAL COMPLEX I JUST MAKE THE THINGS I MAKE AN MAN THER ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE THOD IT FIGURING OUT HAS SELDOM OR GET THEM INTO STORES AR GETTING ON TO SERVICES DO YOU HAVE A PROCESS OF CAPTURING IDEAS LIKE OYOU WRITE THEM DOWN UM AND THE REASON THIS QUESTION CAME UP SO MANY TIMES I THINK IS THAT LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE IT GET GREAT IDEAS WRITE UPON WAKING OR WHILE DRIVING OR IN THE SHOWER RANDOM TIMES AND THEY WERE WONDERING WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE ANY WAY OF COLLECTING AND CURATING YOUR IDEAS PRIOR TO EMBARKING ON QUOTENQUOTE A PROJECT I I WRITE THEM I MAKE NOTES IN MY THON I DO IT ALL THE TIME I DON'T HAVE A GREAT WAY OF DOING IT AND SOMETIMES I MAKI N OT AND THEN COME BACK TO IT LATER AND HAVE NO IDE WHAT IT MEANS DO YOU MAKE THOSE NOTES A BY WRITING OR BY A LIKE VOICE MAMMA WRITING THAT SAID VOICE MAMO MIGHT BE A SOMETHING WORTH TRYING I'VE NOT NEVER TRIED THAT HOW DO YOU VIOU MONEY IN RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR WORK MEANING HOW DO YOU PLACE IT IN THE CONSTELLATION OF THINGS RELATED TO A PROJECT ET YOU MENTIONED EARLY YOU LET OTHER PEOPLE DO THE NEGOTIATIONS BUT MONEY IS JUST ANOTHER FORM OF ENERGY HOW DO YOU PLACE IT IN T IN THE CONTOUR OF WHAT YOU DO I DON'T I TRY NOT THINK IT AT ALL AND I BECAUSE I COME FROM POM CROCKBACKGROUND WHICH WAS LIKE A DO IT YOURSELF BACKGROUND IT WAS ALWAYS MORE ABOUT THE IDEA AND THE EXECUTION OF THE IDEA WITH WHAT EVER YOU COULD USE TO DO IT SO IF I DIDN'T HAVE A IENOUGH TO GO TO A PROFESSIONAL RECORDING S STUDIO THAN I WOULD FIND A FRIEND WHO HAD HOMES RECORDING STUDIO IN RECORD OR WHATEVER IT WAS OR BORROWING A DRUM MACHINE WHEN I BEFORE I HAD TO DRUM MACHINE I WOULD ALWAYS FIND WAYS TO MAKE THE THINGS I WANTED TO MAKE AND DAM I CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME WHERE A FINANCIAL BOUNDARY GOT IN THE WAY OF MAKING SOMETHING AND I SEE IT HAPENING A LOT AROUND ME AND IT DAM I THINK SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT IT AS THE MONEY IS WHAT ALLOWS IT TO HAPPEN AND I THINK I JUT SEE IT AS THE IDEAS WHAT ALLOWS ITO HAPPEN AND THEN THE INGENUITY IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO IT WITH YOU KNOW BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY JUST GO TO MAKE IT WHATEVER THE THAT VERSION IS IT MAY NOT BE THE DREAM VERSION BUT WHATEVER VERSION YOU CAN EXECUTE IS THE ONE FOR YOU TO MAKE I CAN ATTEST THE FACT THA I LAUNCH MY ODCASS IN MY CLOSET IN TO PANGA CANYON WHICH FELT TELTHE NATURAL CAUSE I ALSO COM FROM THE SCAPE OARDING PONCROCK THING WERE LIKE WHEN EVER OCCUR TO ME T GET A PROFESSIONAL STUDIO BUILT LIKE WERE NOW WE HAV THIS ONE BUILT FOR US BUT AT THE TIME LIKE COURSE HE IS A CLOSET CAUSE YOU JUST NEED A BLACK BACK DROP AND YOU KNOW I THINK STARTING FROM THERE MAKE SO MUCH SENSE AND YOU ALSO REALIZE IN THE MINIMALEST APPROACH YOU KNOW ANYTHING ADDED IS JUST SOMETHING ADDED SAY YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU NEED IF YOU START WITH A LOT OF STUFF AROUND Y YE IT'S IT CAN JUST BE A DISTRACTION A'M FRIENDS WERE THERIN ARINASKI HIS GREAT DIRECTOR AND HIS FIRST MOVE YOU WAS CALLE PI AND HE MADE IT FOR PRACTICALLY NO MONEY AND IT WAS REALLY WELL LOVED AND THEN THE NEXT MOVING HE MADE WAS ALSO WITHWILDLY SUCCESSFUL AND HE MADE IT FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY AND THEN HE MADE THIS HUGE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR MOVI AND IT WASN'T IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE A SUCCESS THAT MOVI ND IT WAS A CASE OF WHERE HAVING MORE MONEY DIDN'T HELP HIM TELL A STORY IT'S JUST ONE PARTICULAR CASE AM AND IT'S NO RULE TO FOLLOW BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT MAKE KING THEVERSION THAT YOU CAN MAKE WITH THE MEANS THAT YOU HAVE THAT ADDS SOMETHING REAL TO THE PROJECT THAT MAY BE BETTER THAN THE ONE THAT HAS LOT OF MONEY THROWN AT IT IMTHING THAT SINK IN AROUND A LOT OF ONLINE TUTORIALS FOR SCIENCE HAVE A LOT OF VISUALS BUT WE KNEW WE WANTED TO DO YOU TWO BUT ALL SOUCH JUS PURE AUDIO AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE FUSTRATING THAN SOMEBODBE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY THAT YOU CAN'T SEE CAUSE YOU'RE JUSTLESS THING TO IT AH AND THE VISUALS WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE TO DO RIGHT AND IN THE END I THINK IF P I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THE CLASS ROOM AS WELL AS VIA PODCASTING IF PEOPLE CAN HERE SOMETHING CLEARLY ENOUGH IN CREAT AN IMAGE IN THEIR OWN MIND OF HOW THEY WOULD VISUALIZE IT THEN IT'S IN THERE FOR GOOD WHEREAS JUST HAVING PEOPLE LOOK AT A SLIDE WITH WITH A BUNCH OF BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATIONS ON IT THAT DOES NOTHING FOR RETENTION OF MATERIAL UM SO I THINK THE MINIMALIST APPROCH I THINK SOMETIMES IS REALLY THE BEST ONE MAYBE IT'S ALWAYS THE BEST ONE BECAUSE IT FORCES THE BETTER SOLUTION LIKE THE IN ANY CASE I DO REALIZE I EDITORIALIZED THEIR FOLKS I ENTERED THE ANSWERING PORTION OF THE NOT JUST THE QUESTION  ASKING PORTION HAVE YOU EVER FELT THAT SOMETHING WAS TOO OBSCURE FOR MAIN STREAME AUDIENCE APPEAL TO THE POINT WHERE YOU DID NOT RELEASE IT EVER TELL TELL US MORE IF I LACKE SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE MAYBE THEY' LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW HOW CAN I JUDGE HOW CAN I JUDGE EVERY I'VE BEEN TOLD WITH EVERY NEWTHING THAT I'VE DONE IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEINITLE WORK EVERY SINGLE TIME REALLY EVERY SINGLE TO GETT O BOYS ELEL COOL J BASTY BOY SLAYER A DELL EVERY ONE OF THEM EMANAM EVERY ONE EVERY TIME WHEN I WENT FROM PRODUCING RAPRECORDS TO PRODUCEIN SLAYER YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOUR YURE RAP PRODUCEER IT'S GING TO BE TERRIBLE DON'T DO IT OR THEN JOHNNY CAST YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU'RE A METAL RAP PRODUCER YOU CAN'T DO THAT'S GAING TO BE TERRIBLE DON'T DO IT EVERY SINGLE TIME STILL TO THE DAY STILL TO THIS SDAY I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN YOU LAUNCH TETROGRAMATSON AND IT'S GOING SO WELL I LISTEN TO EVERY EPISODE I LOVE THE INTERVIEWS IVE BEEN FORTUNA TO BE ON THEIR TWICE I THING THE SECOND ONE IS STILL HAS M MAN RELEASE YET BUT I MENTION TETROGRAMMATON BECAUSE IT JUST FEELS SO YOU LIK THE ADERETES CHI TALKED ABOUT IT TURING MY INTRO BUT THE ADERIES ARE AMAZING LIKE I LISTEN TO THE ADRITES OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THEYRE SO CLEVER AND THEY I DON'T THEY PUT ME IN A STATE I FEE LIKE AM WATCHING I'M LIKE EM TRANSPORTED TO AS IF I WAS LIKE BORN IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES I'M LISTENING TO TALIVISION FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING THERE LIKE THERE'S REALLY SOMETHING THERE IT IT'S IT CAME OUT OF SOLVING A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM WAS A WHEN I DECIDED TO DO THE PODCAST IDE EVEN RECORTED THE FIRST SEVERAL EPISODES I'M A FRIEND OF MIND SAID WELL YOU CAN HAVE DO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A ADDS ON THE SHOW TO SUPPORT BEING ABLE TO DO THE SHOW THEN YOU'RE GONGT HAVE TO READ THE ADDS AND I SAID I DON'T REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE READING AS I DON'T THINK THATS SOMETHING I CAN DO WELL I SAID I'M COOL WITH THE IDEA OF ONLY ADVERTISING PRODUCTS I BELIEVE IN OR THAT I USE CUS THAT'S IF I GET TO ESSENTIALLY PROMOTE SOMETHING I'LL DO THAT WITH THINGS THAT I USE BUT DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE READING IT IUM AND IS LIKE WHL YOU HAVE TO IT'S GOING TO BE EXPECTED OF YOU AND IT WAS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY IWAS LIKE A O KA I UNDERSTAND ITS EXPECTED OF ME WHAT CAN I DO THAT'S TRUE TO ME THAT AD SOMETHING YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF IT BEING LESS THAN HOW CAN I MAKE IT MORE THAN AND IT WAS JUST SOLVING THIS PROBLEM OF NEEDING A WAY TO HAVEN'T ADVERTISEMENT THAT I DIDN'T FEEL BAD ABOUT AND THEN GOT INSPIRED AND HAD THIS IDEA AN START MAKING THEM AND NOW THERE MY FAVORITE THING IN THE PODCAST WHEN IT WHEN IT IN MANY PODCASTS HONESTLY WHEN HIT ADDS COME UP I FORWARD THROUGH THEM WHEN I AS A LISTENER ON PETROGRAMATON WHEN I WHEN IT COMMERCIAL COMES ON I ALWAYS LISTEN TO THEM IT'S SO IT'S LIKE A IT'S A HIGHLIGHT AND THEY MAKE ME SMILE WHICH IS IT GET AN AGAIN I DIDN'T SET OUT TO DO THAT I I JUST WAS TRYING TO SOLVE A CREATIVE PROBLEM SO SOMETIMES THE YUM THE INEVATE OF IDEAS DON'T COME WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN INEVATIVE IDEA IT'S JUST THERE'S THIS SLOT TO FILL THIS IS THE WAY IT'S NORMALLY DONE I'M NOT COMFORTABLE DOING IT THE NORMAL WAY HOW ELSE CAN WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T JUST SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT IT BECOMES AN ACTUAL FEATURE YO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LIKESOLUTION SEEKING THAT IS PART OF OR AT LEAST AS A LINE WITH THE CREATIVE PROSSESS RY A YET THE AZAR OR EXTRAORDINARY WE  LES THING TIT IN ITALY I LIKE PLAYED THOT WHEN AGAIN I LOVE THE WAY THE GI SAYS THERE WERE SHILAGIT IT'S THAT SHELLAGET THERE'S NOMETHING LIKG BUT IN IT BUT I I GAT TO THE ACS AT FORS DOT DON'T TAKE WHAT I JUST SAID IS AS A EVIDENCING WHAT THE ADDET LIKE AUSTRALIAN ACCEN I THAT DASH YOLOGET AND THE CHIME IS IN THE BACKI SAYS SO CAD YOU DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL CRAT CORRECT HAVE YOU EVER HAD A SIBOVALCOL I HAD I DRANK ALCOHOL ONCE AS PART OF A CLASS EXPERIMENT AND HAD TO MIX ALL THESE DRINKS AND TASTE THEM AND IM IT WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE BUT IT WAS  IT WAS A REQUIREMENT IN THE CLASS I WAS TAKING WHILE HOUT SCHOOL WAS DIFFERENT BACK THAN OR THAT SCHOOL WAS DIFFERENT I THINK SCHOOL WAS DIFFERENT WE'S TO PRICK OUR FINGERS INTO OUR OWN BLOOD TUSS IN THE SIN NEVER DID IX I WAYS ALWAYS NEEDLEFOBIC BUT THAT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WAS ASKED OF US TO DO YET YOU CAND NEVER GET AWAY WITH THAT NOW N IN HE HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM THE REASON I ASK ABOUT ILCALLS IT FIRS S ALL I'M NOT THE ANTI I'L CALL CRUSADER EVEN THOUGH I DD AN EPISODE ABOUT I'LL CALL WHICH DISCOURAGE MANY PEOPLE FROM DRINKING MORE OF IT BUT I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THE IDEA OF SMOKING CANABUS DRINKING ALCOHALL FOR THEM IN THEIR MIND IS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE CREATIVE PROCESS ESPECIALLY MUSIC IM FOR THE LOT OF REASONS THAT PEOPLE CAN IMAGINE I THINK IT'S REMARKABLE AND IMPRESSIVE AND WORTH SPENDING A FEW MOMENTS YOU SHARING WITH US YOU KNOW HOW IS THAT YOU WERE AROUND ALL OF THAT YOU'RE CLEARLY PART OF THE PART OF THE CRUE A MEANING YOU'R PART OF THAT THE CREATIVE PROCESS PRESUMABLY PEOPLE LOFFERED YOU IA'LCOHAUL DRUGS ET CETERA BUT SOMETHING IN YOU SEEMS LIKE RESISTIN TO ANY KIND OF PURE PRESSURE AND AND AS AN ADULT THAT IMPRESSIVE BUT TO THINK I CAN OLI G WHEN I WAS SIX FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SURE YOU KNOW IT SOR REGRET IT BUT Y I DRANK I I HAD MY EXPERIENCES AND THEN EVENTUALLY STOPPED THAT BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GOOD AT I NOT DRINKING IF THEY DON'T WNT TO DRINK EVER OR JUST ONCE FROM A HIGH SCHOOL CLASS WHAT WHAT WAS THE INTERNAL NARRATIVE IN YOUR MIND I'M WHEN THAT STUFF WAS AROUND AND WHAT ALLOWED YOU TO JUST I NOM I'MAN IT I BELONG HERE BUT I'M NOT GAN DO THAT IT'S JUST WAS NEVER INTERESTING TIN ME AND I I THINK MAYBE HAD TO DO BEING ONLY CHILD I I'D NEVER BEING ONLY CHILD I THINK MADE ME LESS RESISTIN TO PURE PRESSURE BECAUSE I FELT MORE CONFIDE IN WHO I WAS WHATEVER THAT WAS IM JUST FROM BEING WITH MY BEING WITH MYSELF AND NOT WITH OTHER SIBLINGS I'M GUESSING I DON'T KNOW THAT'S RIGHT BUT THAT'S MY FIRST MY FIRST INCLINATION IS TO GUESS THAT WOULD BE THE CASE ALSO I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN WHAT I LIKE AND KNOWN WHAT I DON'T LIKE AND KNOW THERE ARE THINGS I WANT TO TRY THEIR THINGS I DON'T WANT TO TRY AND I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT NOT DOING SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO DO IF' GREATE ABOUT IT HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT PSYCHADELIC'S GIVEN THAT I'M VERY CURIOUS I'VE NEVER DONE IT BUT I'M VERY CURIOUS AND I'VE BEEN CURIOUS FOR A LONG TIME THER MAY BE TIME WHEN I EXPERIMENT IF THE'RE TWO PSYCHAD ELICON PARTICULAR THAT I FIND REALLY INTERESTING ONE IS A MACERDO SYLISIVIN WHICH I'VE DONE AS PART OF A CLINICAL TRIAL I'M IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT REVEALS IN A VERY INTENSE AND EXPERIENTIAL WAY SOME COMPONENT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND ALLOWS FOR PLASTICITY AND REWIRING OF THE BRAIN THAT'S PERMANENT IF YOU COME TO SOME UNDERSTANDING THROUGH THE SO CALLED INTEGRATION IT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS RISKS THE OTHER ONE THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING MORE ABOUT AND I HAVE NOT TRIED UMAND CARRIES SOME DANGERS AS I BEGAIN WHICH I'S TWENTY TWO HOURS LONG AND PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THE WORLD AS NORMAL WITH THEIR EYES OPEN BUT WHEN THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES THEY GET A LIKE HIGH RESOLUTION MOVI LIKE VERSION OF PRIOR EXPERIENCES BUT THEY HAVE AGENCY WITHIN THOSE MOVIES THEY CAN RESHAPE THEIR REACTIONS THITS BEING AS TO TREAT PITIESTY AND VETERANS AT TO GREAT SUCCESS UM IT HAS SOME CARDIACARISK ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO AND IT'S NOT LEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S NOT BEING EXPLORED ING CLINICAL CHARLES YET BUT THE STATE OF KENTUCKY RECENTLY TOOK I THINK IT'S FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE UM OXY CONTIN SETTLEMENT AND IT'S PUTTING INTO ABOGAIN RESEARCH INTERESTING NOW SO THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT KIND OF SPRING TO MINE THE ONCONTHE CLASSIC SYCODELIC EXPERIENCE HEARD THINGS BOUT IMBIA MAD BUT I N YET I HAVE DONE EM D'A MAY I'S PART AGAIN AS PART OF THERAPUTIC TRIAL IT'S A STRONG IN PATHAGEN UM THE DANGER WITH EM D'AMA I THINK IS THAT UM IF YOU DON'T STAY IN THE IMASK OR IF YOU'RE LISTENING TO MUSIC OR SOMETHING YOU CAN EASILY GET ANCHORED TO SOME EXTERNAL CU AND LIKE SEE A PLANT TO BE LIKE I LOVE PLANS AND SPEND THE WHOLE FORTO SIX HOURS THINKING ABOUT YOUR LOVE OF PLANTS WHICH MIGHT BE VALUABLE BUT I THINK THE STRONG INTROSPECTIVE WORK UM IT'S BEST DONE WITH A THERAPIS THERE AND YOU IN THE EYE MASK AND OCCASIONALLY LEAVING THE EYEMASK IN WRITING THINGS DOWN SO YOU KNOW THE REASON I PUT THAT DETAIL IN THEIR IS THAT UM THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE IS VERY DIFFERENT WITH EYES OPEN VERSES IN THE IMASK WITH A CLINITION THERE VERSIS RECREATIONALLY AND THIT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DANGERS VERSES SAFETY IT'S ALSO ABOUT THEY IT'S A BIG INVESTMENT AND WHAT ONE STANDS TO GET OUT OF IT I THINK DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH INTROSPECTION YOU'RE WILLING TO DO WE WON'T BE DOING IT THIS AFTERNOON THERE WERE AT LEAST A THOUSAND QUESTIONS ABOUT A TENSION DEFICITE AND NARATICISM PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T ORGANIZE THEMSELVES AND I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS AND TRIED TO DISTILL THEM INTO A SINGLE QUESTION AND EVENTUALLY I DID AND IT'S THIS FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY ASSOCIATE THE CREATIVE PROCESS WITH DISORGANIZATION I THINK WHAT'S SO STRIKING ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU EMBODY BOTH THE CREATIVE PROCESS BUT ALSO A STRONG SENSE OF ORGANIZATION AROUND IT LIKE NOTHING SEEMS HEIR BRAINED OR IN LIKE RANDOM OR HAFHAZARD ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOU DO AND YET FOR A LOT O PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES CREATIVES THET THEY'LL SAY O'M A CREATIVE THIS THAT IN ET YOU'LL LOOK AT THE SPACE THEREIN  LIKE CHAOS WHERE THEY OR THERE LIFE IS KIND OF CHAOED NOT ALL OF THEM BUT IS WHAT I'M SAYING MAKING SENSE CAUSE I THINK WHY PEOPLE ORIENT TOWARD YOU AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR SUCCESS WITH THE CREATIVE PROCESS IS THAT YOU'RE EXTREMELY ORGANIZED BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF BEING RIGID YOU WILLING TO EMBELLISHABLE BIT ON THAT PERCEPTION WEATHER NOT IT'S ACCURATE IN ALER SAY THERE'S A PART IN THE PROCESS EARLY ON WHERE IT IS BEFORE IT CAN GET ORGANIZED WERE IT'S FREE AND IT'S PLAYFUL AND IT CAN BE CHAOTIC I'M IT'S JUST NOT THE IT'S A BY PRODUCT OF WHATEVERIS HAPPENING IF IT'S NOT IT'S GOOD BECAUSE ITS CHAOTIC AND IT'S IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE SOMETIMES CHAOTIC IN THAT AND THAT EXPERIMENT IN THE BEGINNING YOU WERE WE REALLY PLAYING WITH THIS IDEA OF HAVING FUN AND CREATING STIMULATION AND SEEING HOW IT MAKES US FEEL AN TRY A LOT OWE COULD TRY WACKY THINGS TO GET THERE 'M BUT THEN WHEN IT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET THAT THAT FEELING OF LIKE ALL THIS IS INTERESTING I'VEN'T SEEN THIS BEFORE THEN IT GETS MORE U'M CONTROLLED BUT IT STARTS IN A VERY FREE PLACE AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD REALLY USE THE WORD CHAOTIC BUT IT COULD BE IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE WRONG I WOULD SEEM MORE FREE WOULD BE THE WORD FREE LIKE NO UM NO EXPECTATION AND TOTAL IMMERSION IN LIKE AND IMPROPOSATION THAT YOU'RE PARTISSIPATING IN THAT CAN GO WHEREVER IT WANTS TO GO AND YOU'RE COOL ALLOWING IT TO GO WHEREVER IT WANTS TO GO AND SOMETIMES WHEN IT GOES SOMEWHERE DANGEROUS THAT'S WHEN IT GETS INTERESTING SO THE THE I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THAT DANGER ASPECT MAY MIT'S WHY I LIKE PARESTLING I DON'T KNOW BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT WHEN YOU GET TO THIS THES EDGES WHERE THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY IT CAN GET VERY INTERESTING SPEAKING OF UM STUFF THAT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY AND THAT TO SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHOCKING I REMEMBER HERE AND GET OBOYS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND LIKE WA LIKE THEY'RE TAKIN CERTAIN THINGS PRETTY FAR WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH AN ARTIST AND THEY VENTURE OUT INTO THAT PLACE WHERE THINGS ARE LIKE MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE SHOCKING WHAT IS THAT FEELING FOR YOU INTERNALLY LIKE IS IT HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SHOCK VALUE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY OPENING UP A NEW CREATIVE AVENYOU ARE INSIGHT LIKE LIKE HOWTO YO DO OU RECALL THE FIRST TIME YOU YOU HEARD LIKE BUSHWICK AND ELSGIS DO THEIR THAING YWELL WHAT WAS YOUR INTERNAL NARRATIVE I CAN'T BELIEVE IT I CAN'T BELIEV WHAT THEY SAYING IT'S REALLY A PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT ANY ONE HAS SAID IN THIS MUSIC BEFORE IT HAD SWITCH BECAUSE THE THE ORIGINAL IN ORIGINALLY EN RAP THERE WAS A LOT OF BOASTING ABOUT THEMSELVES PRAGGING AND THEN WE GOT TO THE MESSAGE HAPENED AND THERE WAS SOME SOCIAL COMMENTARY THEN THERE WAS GANKS TO RAP AND THEN THE GETTO BOYS TOOK A VERSION OF GANKS T RA AND TURNED IT INTO HORROR RAP WHICH WAS MUCH MORE GRAPHIC THAN GANS TO RAP GANKSTER RAP WAS TALKING ABOUT A UM A REAL LIFE SITUATION WHERE'S THE GETO BOYS TOOK IT INTO HORROR MOVI TERRITORY IT WAS MORE FANTASY UM BUT IT SEEMED REALLY SCARY AT THE TIME IN THE WAY THAT YOU'RE SCARED AT A GREAT HARM MOVY DO YOU LIKE HARMOIS I DON'T DO YOU LIKE MONSTER MOVIES O WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT REAL LIKE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE A  AS SUPPOSE TO HAR MOVIES WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S UM YOU KNOW PEOPLE GETTING KILLED BY ANOTHER HUMAN LIKE STUFF THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE WORLD VERSES UM YOU KN AW MONSTERS AND ASOMBES AND THAT KOND OF THING I DON'T THINK I REALLY LIKE EITHROUGH THEM VERY MUCH I LIKE THINGS THAT MAKE ME FEEL GOOD I DON'T REALLY LIKE A DRENLAN YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO BE EXCITED FOR SOME REASON IN AUDIO I LIKE SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME EXCITED BUT IN VISUALS I CANNOT TOLKE THINGS THAT MAKE ME EXCITED INTERESTING AND YOU'RE ABLE TO CON OF CLEAN YOURSELF OF EXPERIENCES EASILY RI LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU LISTEN TO SOMETHING IT'S REALLY SHOCK AND YOU DON'T CARRY THAT SHOCK TO YOUR SLEEV BERTS OF THE NEXT DAY LIKE IT DOESN'T TROUBLE  BUT A MOVI CAN CAN IMPACK ME LIKE THERE WAS A MOVI CALLED MELANCHOLYA THAT I SAW YEARS AGO LARGSVON TREER MOVI AND I THOUGHT ITWAS VERY BEAUTIFUL MOVI BUT I WAS IN A BAD MOOD I WOULD SAY FOR THREE MONTHS FROM THE TIME I WATCHED THAT MOVI ON IT' JUST LIKE DID SOMETHING TO MY BRAIN THAT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD AND IT COULDN'T SNAP OUT OF IT SENCHON THERE THERE ARE FEW MOVIES THAT HAVE DONE THAT TO ME THE MOVI BLUE VALENTINE WHICH HAS DONE REALLY WELL M WHICH IS WITH A RHIN GOZLING AND SOME ONE ELSEWHERE UM IT'S A RELATIONSHIP I WON'T EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS IN THE AR TO THE RELATIONSHIP BUT IT JUST LIKE THE MOVI HAUNTED ME THERE'S ONE SEEN WHERE HE'S WEARING A MIS FITZ SHIRT AND ALS I I LIKE AND THAT'S A A PARTICULARLY GOOD SEEN WHERE HE'S SINGING TO HER IM BUT THE REST THE MOVE JUST BRINGS ABOUT SUCH FEELINGS ALIKE JUST HOW HARD LIFE CAN BE OMETIMES AND HOW MISGUIDED PEOPLED CAN BE IN RELATIONSHIP AND IT IT'S INTERESTING HOW MOVIES CAN JUST KIND OF IN BED IN US IT'S NOT PLEASANT I WANT TALK ABOUT ANYMORE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ASKING ABOUT HOW YOU CONSUME INFORMATION IN THE WORLD RELATED TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR NEWS FROM YOU NOT TALK ABOUT THI ALOT HOW HOW DO WE KNOW IT TO TRUST THESE DAYS I'M DID SHOULD WE HAVE EVER TRUSTED THE NEWS ORSE IS IT LEST TRUSTWORTHY NOW I WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR IN FORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND STAY A BREAST OF LIKE WORLD AFFAIRS I I HONESTLY I DON'T FEE LIKE I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW I AM I TEND TO LOOK AT T ALL LIKE WRESTLING SO IF THE STORYS GOOD I MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTED IN THE STORY BUT I STILL DON'T HOLD MUCH A BELIEF THAT THAT STORY'S TRUE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE ANY MORE A I WAS ASKED TO COMMENT ON A PARTICULARLY WELL KNOWN PERSON WHO'S NOT CONSIDERED VERY SAVORY WHY A COUPLE NEWS AVENUES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND AM I DO'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE HAW OIN MIND THAT I WOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS PERSON AND AND I GAVE IZERO INFORMATION TO THESE NEWS OUTLETS AND I'M NONE THE LESS THEY THEY THEY DIDN'T PUBLISH QUOTES FOR ME BUT THEY THEY PUBLISH THINGS THAT I KNOW TO BE COMPLETELY FALSE AND THEY KNOW TO BE COMPLETELY FALSE SO I I WAS JUST STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT LI CAN SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING THAT WOULD GET YOU IF YOU'D LOSE YOUR JOB YOU FOR EVER WELL AT ONE POINT IN TIME YOU WOULD HAVE LOST YOU JOB NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE IF YOU LOSE YOUR JOB CAUSE WE SEE IT HAPPENING A LOT RIGHT E IT'S WILD HAVE YOU EVER READ ANYTHING ABOUT YOU THAT'S NOT TRUE OH YE O YE CASE WE BASE ON ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THAT SOME OF IT IS PLAYFUL STUFF LIKE ON READIT AND NOW THEYAVE FLAGED AS AS PLAT THEY HAVE A LITTLE FLAG THAT THEY CAN PUT AS YOU KNOW COMMEDIC OR SOMETHING BUT OH SURE I MEAN THINGS NOT JUST TAKEN OUT A CONTECT WITH THINGS LIKE COMPLETELY WRONG I JUST LIKE THAT I DON'T OW'T EVEN NOWER IF YOU WILD GET THE STUFF FROM I KEEP WAITING FOR THE THING THOT MEN TO SEE THAT SAYS THAT I'M DEAD  THAT'LL BE THE MOMENT SO BASE ON THAT EXPERIENCE WHY WOULD YOU BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU READ ABOUT ANYONE ELSE YOU U U GET TO SEE FIRST HAND THAT THEREI JUST STORYES JUST NOT TRUE AND PRESUMABLY YOU'VE SEEN THINGS WRITTEN ABOUT YOU THAT ARE NOT SUTELY RIGHT ABSOLUTELY RIGH AN ARTEST I KNOW FRIENDS OF MINE THEY WRIT THINGS ABOUT IM I KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE WILD WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATE OF PLAY AND IS THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING APPARENT AND HAVING A YOUNG CHILD HAS THAT ALLOWED YOU MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLAY AND DESEE THE WORLD THROUGH CHILD LIKE LENSAS IN NA GREATER CAPACITY ORS I BE ANAWL JUST SEPARATE FROM THEUR CREATIVE PROCESS I WOULD SAY I'M FAIRLY CHILD LIKE ALL THE TIME I TI TO STAY AS A OPEN THE BEAUTY OF CHILDHOOD IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AM IN DOCTRINATED YET SO YOU DOU SEE THINGS AND YOU HAVE WONDER ABOUT THEM AND IT'S A GREAT FEELING THAT FEELING OF WONDER AND NOW WHEN SOMMER I OUT TELL YOU STORY THIS IS A BE TRUE STORY MY FRIEND OWN CAME OVER ONE NIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND HE HAD JUST SEEN AM LUMINESSENCE IN THE WATER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND HE HAD DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WHAT IT WAS AND THOUGHT HE WAS HAVING MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE AND WHE'S SO EXCITED THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED THE THE WAVES WERE LIKE THERE WAS LIGHT EVERYWHERE IT WAS SO COOL I'D NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT AND I SO YE THAT A LUMINESSENCE AND I EXPLAINED WHAT IT WAS AND IT DESTROYED THE MAGIC FOR HIM HE WAS REALLY HAVING A CHILD LIKE MAGICAL EXPERIENCE AND I DESTROYED IT I TELLING HOM THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT I TRY TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE I CAN EXPERIENCE WHAT HE EXPERIENCES AND I DON'T LET BE STORY RUIN WHAT'S I LOW THE POSSIBILITY TO GO PAST WHAT I'M TOLD THE STORY IS BUT THAT THINGS CAN BE EVEN WILDER THAND THE RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR ME LEARNING THE REDUCTIONIST SCIENCE BEHIND SOMETHING TO ME ADD'S DEPTH AND BEAUTY BUT THEN AGAIN I REALIZE ON I'VE BEEN IN DOCTRINATED INTO THE THE FIELD OF SCIENCE THE MATRIXS THEY CALL IT BEMA TRICKS THIS ONE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND MADAMIN AS SOON THAT YOU UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT HAS TO DO WITH PEOPLE YOU'VE WORKED WITH IF RICK HAD CASUALLY DROPPD THAT THE ROMND'S NAME THEMSELVES AFTER THE FAKE LAST NAME PAULMAC CARTNEY USED TO CHECK INTO HOTELS DURING BEEDOLMANIA WITH THAT OF BLOWN ANDREW'S MIND THIS A GOT A WERE GUCHIT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS IT TRUE THAT THE ROMOND'S NAME THEMSELVES AFTER THE FAKE LAST NAME THAT PAULMAC CARTNEY USED TO CHECK INTO HOTELS DURING BEEDOLMANIA HUM I DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A TRUE STORY I DO KNOW THAT PAUL MC CARTNEY USED THE NAME PAUL REMOAN WHEN CHECKING INTO HOTELS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHERE THE REMONT'S GOT THE NAME GOT IT AND HERE IS HOW RUMORS TURN IN TO COTON COT FACTS ON THERINERNET SO WE HADN'T ALSO MAYBE THE PAUL REMOND STORY IS NOT TRUE EITHER BUT THATS STORY I'VE HEARD RIGHT THAT REMINDS ME AND AND I THINK THIS IS A IMPORTANT CASE IN POINT THAT THERE'S A WHAT I CONSIDER A VERY FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU JOHNNY CASH JO STRUMMER AND HENRY RAWLINS YOU'RE WERRING A DEAD KENNEDY SURE THE FOUR OF YOUR FACING ONE ANOTHER AND I LOVE THAT PHOTOGRAPH BECAUSE IF WHO AS IN IT UM AND I REMEMBER HERING A RARE TRACK FROM STRUMMER IN THE MESCALEROS CALLED ON THE ROAD TO ROCK AND ROLL UM AND THEN FOR SOME REASON PROBABLY BECAUSE MY PHONE IS TAPPED IN TO MY BRAIN I WAS SERVED UP OF VIDIO ON SOCIA MEDIA OF HENRY RAWLANS TELLING THE STORY OF THAT GATHERING OF THE FOUR OF YOU WHERE RAWLINS AS DESCRIBING THE STORY OF OF JOS STRUMMER LEANING IN TO JOHNNY CASH AND SAYING HEY I WROTE A SONG FOR YOU IT GOES ON THE ROW TO RACHOQE AND I REMEMBER COMIN YOU AND SAYING RICK GUESS WHAT REMEMBER THAT PHOTO YOU COU REMEMBER THE PHOTO I SAID YOU HAVE RAWLANS HAS THE STORY OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THAT MOMENT NOW SO EXCITED AND HIS ET YOU SAID YET I DON'T REMEMBER THAT IT MIGHT BE TRUE IT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT IT MIGHT BE ENTIRELY MADE UP ALSO WE'RE NOT CALLING HENRY A LYRE BUT HENRY I II BELIEVE ENRILYLY HASN REMEMBERS THAT STORY AND THAT WAS THIS EXPERIENCE THAT WAS NOT MY EXPERIENCE OR I DON'T REMEMBER BEING MY EXPERIENCE BUT WHO KNOWS ANYTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAID IT'S TRUE ANYTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAID LIKE IT HAD AS MUCH TO DO THE FACT THAT I DON'T REMEMBER HAS MUCH TO DO WITH WHATEVER I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND THE STORY THAT HENRY TOLD HAD S MUCH TO DO WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HENRY SAID WHEN IT HAPPENED WE HAVE NO IDEA YOU KNOW IT'S WE HAVE NO IDEA DYOU REMEMBER SOMEBODYS SHOOTING THE PHOTOGRAPH I DO NOT I'LL PUT A LINK TO THAT PHOTOGRAPH ON THE AIR ATS A REALLY INCREDIBLE GATHERING OF I'VE SEEN THE PHOTO BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT BEINGSHIP I'M LOOKING FOR A HIGH RESOLUTION VERSION OF THAT PHOTO IF ANYONE CAN FIND ME WEN LL BE HAPPY TO COMPENSATE YOU WELL THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR DAILY ROUTINE PEOPLE OF THIS THE MORNING ROUTINE THE DAILY ROUTINE AND WILE I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODYIS NECESSARY ROUTINE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE NEXT U'M IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND JUST GIVING US A SENSE OF LIKE THE FIRST COUPLE HOURS OF YOUR DAY WHAT THAT TYPICALLY LOOKS LIKE ONE YER LIKE NOT TRAVELLING IN YOUR SETTLED INTO TO A PLACE IT'S DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE PLACE THAT I'M IN BUT TYPICALLY IT INVALVES WAKING UP GOING OUT INTO THE SUN AS NAKED AS POSSIBLE TO START THE DAY UM I TRY TO TIK SLOWLY A WAKE UP SLOWLY AND PROBABLY WITHIN AN HOUR OF THAT IL LEVE THE HOUSE AND GO FER AS LONG AS TI BEECH WALK AS POSSIBLE OR IF IM IN A PLACE WITHI'S A JIM SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK I'LL GO TO THE GIM INSTEAD BUT SOME I'LL DO SOME ACTIVITY I WOULD SAY ABOUT AN HOURAPHTER WAKING UP SOMETIMES ITS AN HOUR AND A HALF S OETIMES LESS TEPENNIG ON THE PLACE ON THAT I ALSO MIGHT DO STRETCHING BEFORE I GO ON HE WALK UNDO UM TO SEVERAL STRETCHES ON BOGAMATS ON THE FLOOR WORK A WITH FUMROLLERS OR BALLS OR SOME DIFFERENT THINGS I DON'T START MY DAY UNTIL THOSE THINGS ARE OUT OF THE WAY I TRY TO AVOID UM ANY WORK RELATED ANYTHING NOW THAT'S THAT SAID IF A THOUGHT COMES UP THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT I'LL KNOT IT I WON'T DUM AVOID THOUGHTS BUT I TEND NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY WORK IN TILL PROBABLY ELEVEN O'CLOCK ELEVEN A AND WOULD BE THE SOONEST AND IN AND SOME DAYS NOT UNTIL ONE O'CLOCK AND THEN I DO FOCUSTD WORK UNTIL MAY BE SIX AND THAND I'D SPEND THE REST OF THE NIGHT AH TRYING TO WINE DOWN OUT OF WORK M SO ONE P M TO SIX PI MO REALLY THE PEAK PROBABLY NITA WORK HOURS AN COULD BE ELEVEN TO LET TO DAY WE STARTED HERE AT ELEVEN AND THAT FELT LIKE I FELT LIKE I'D BE GOOD BY ELEVEN AND I READY DID MY MY MORNING WALK I HAD TO ARGUMENT ON THE BEACH IE A WAS IN THE SUN I WAS IN HOT TAB A HAT A WHOLE WHOLE MORNING ALREADY AND THEN WHAT IS YOUR EVENING LINE DOWN LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF THE SPACE THAT YOU'RE IN IRE TRYING TO CREATE AND YOUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE WELL IT'S ONLY RED LIGHT U I'M USUALLY WEARING I FROM THE TIME SUNSET SOME WORING RED GLASSES I'M MINI SPACE WITH ONLY RED LIGHT AN NINETY NINE PER CENT O THE TIME HOME WITH MY FAMILY AND WE TALK I MIGHT WATCH A RESTLING OR A DOCUMENTARY WITH RED GLASSES ON UM WE EAT DINNER TOGETHER OR WE EAT DINNER IN SHIFTS DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S WORKING BUT WERE ALL WERE ALTOGETHER AND I FIND SOMETHING TO OCCUPY MY MIND THAT GETS ME OUT OF THE WORK DAY THAT SAID SOMETIMES THE IDEAS STILL FLOW AND I'LL NOTE THEM BUT I AVOID I AVOID ANY KIND OF A WORK PHONE CALL OR UM ANYTHING THAT'S STIMULATING OR THAT WILL GET ME THINKING ABOUT IT I AIM FOR SUNSET AND THEN I'M USUALLY IN BED I'MUSUALG IN BED BY TEN AND UM AND BEFALLSLEEP WITHIN FIFTEEN MINUTES YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO LIGHT IS FASCINATING THE SUNLIGHT PIECE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND WI'LL MAKE SENSE TO THE LISTENERS THIS PODCAST WE HAVEN'T DONE TOO MANY EPISODES BUT WE WILL DO MORE THAT COVERERS THE TRYING TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE IN THE EVENING IM YOU'RE WEARING THE RED A LENDS GLASSES NOW EVEN THAUHI'S THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THESE BRIGHT LIGHTS AROUND US CORRECT AND HAVE YOU FOUND THAT LIMITING YOUR BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EXPOSURE IN THE EVENING HAS BENEFITED YOU AND ESOLUTELY AND AND ONCE YOU'VE DONE IT ONCE YOU'VE CHANGED AND AVOID THE CLOOKING AT SCREENS OR MIGHT YOU KNOW MY PHONE TURNS RED AT NIGHT WHEN I SEE SOMEONE ELSE'S PHONE IF  SOMEMONE COMES TO VISIT AND THEIR PHONE LIGHTS UP AT NIGHT IT'S BLINDING AND IT'S SO DISTURBING AND FOR THEM THAT'S NORMAL THEY'RE IN THIS HEIGHTENED BLOWN OUT PLACE ALL THE TIME I'M STAYING AT NEUTRAL I'M SAYING IT AT THE THEN THE MORE NATURAL HOW HOW THE WORLD WOULD BE IF MAN DIDN'T CREATE ALL DESA THESE LOUD THINGS YOU HAD LOUDA LOU DEVICES I'VE SWITCHED MY PHONE THANKS TO YOUR IN PUT IN WE WILL HAVE RELEASED A CLIP ON THIS IM BY TIME THIS EPISODE AIRS ON THE TRIPLE CLICK APPROACH TO THE PHONE THAT YOU CAN PUT IN VERY EASILY IM TOO ALLOW IT TO GO FROM REGULAR SCREEN TO RED SCREEN AT NIGHT SO THA YOU DO'T HAVE TO GO INTO THE SETTINGS YO SHOW ME JUST TRIPLE CLICK AN WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT AM EXPLANATION AND RICK TAUGHT ME THAT WHEN I WAS OVER IN ITALY EVERON IN IS HOME TURNED TO ME AND A SAID WAY YOUR PHONE IS SO BRIGHT YOU GOT TO DO THE RED LIGHT THING I SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW AND IT TAUGHT ME THAT S T'S A VERY USEFUL TRECT IM HAVE YOU NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE SINCE LOOKING HUGE POSITIVE DIFFERENCE I SLEEP BETTER THERE A GREAT DAYDO NOW CAUSE OF COURSE I GO THEN FIND THE DATA THAT IM YOU NOW FOR SHIFT WORKERS PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO BE UP AT NIGHT WORKING IF THEY PUT THEM UNDER RED LIGHT THE YE AMOUNT OF CARTUS ALL AT THAT TIME IS SUPPRESSED WHICH IS GREAT M AS COMPARED TO WEN THEY'E UNDER BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS WITHOUT RED LENDS GLASSES WERE IF THE'RE AND RED LIGHTS ITS FAR FAR MORE BENEFICIAL LASS CUARTUS ALL YOU WANT CORTS ALL HIGH EARLY IN THE DAY VIEWING SOME LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY INCREASE IT BY AT LEAST FIFTY PER CENT THAN YOU WANTT TO TAPEER OFF AH AND ON AND ON I HEARD SOMETHING RECENTLY WHICH IS GOINGTO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE ONE THING THAT'S HAPPEN IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WHICH MAY AT LEAST PARTIALLY EXPLAIN THE OBISITY CRISIS IS THAT CALLORIES WHICH ARE DEPLEATED OF NEUTRIANTS MICHR NEUTRIANCS ARE VERY CHEAP NOW SEE ITHE'R VERY CHEAP TO GET CALLORIES BUT THEY AREN'T NEUTRICIOUS CHCALLORIES IN ADDITION THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN LIGHTING TECHNOLOGY SO THAT BLUE LIGHT PHOTONS ARE VER E CHEAP LIKE WHEN I WAS A KID THEY MY PRANCE IS A TURN OFF THE LIGHTS IT'S COSTING US ALL THIS MINT NOW IT'S VERY CHEAP TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON IN A HOME THE HEAT IS A IFFERENT STORY BUT WITH RESPECT SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CHEAP PHAUTONS SO I THINK OF BLUE LIGHT AS CHEAP PHAUTONS NOT THE GOOD FOR YOU PHATONS NOT NOURISHING PHATONS IT'S CAND CONSUMING CALORIES TOO OFTEN EARTH THE WRONG TIMES OF DAY WE KNOW AS BAD FOR YOU CONSUMING PHAUTONS IN THE WRONG FORM AT THE WRONG TIME A DAY BAD FOR YOU AND I THINK THOSE TE TWO THINGS COMBINED PLUSS ALL THE DOWNSTHROUGH NEGATIVE CASCADES CAN LARGELY EXPLAIN THE OBECITY AND IN SOME SENSIMENTAL HEALTH CRISIS INTERESTING I JUST A THERE I EDITORIALIZED AGAIN I REALIZE THAT RETRENISH IF THE RATIO THE MORE RICK LESS ANDREW YOU CAN'T HELPWE CAN'T HELP HIMSELF AND RICK INDULGES ME SIS YOU THERE ARE UMBER OF QUESTIONS IN HERE THAT ASKED ME YOU KNOW WHAT HOW IS RICK HELP TO YOU AND I I'M REFRAINING FROM I ANSWERING THOSE CONIS PEOPL WANT YOUR ANSWERS FOR THEM BUT I DO ALL THE THINGS THAT RICS REFERRING TO I'M NOT WEARING RED LEN'S GLASSES NOW BUT I HAVE CHANGED A LOT OF MY HEALTH PRACTICES AND OR SOUGHT OUT SCIENCE TO TASKED WHETHER NOT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR A WHILE MAKE SENSE AND INDEED IN EVERY CASE THEY'VE MADE SENSE I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT TO BECAUSE YOUARE HERE BUT YOU AND I DO A LOT OF THE SAME NAN WERE WERE INTERESTED AND IF IT DIDN'T WORK WE PROABLY STOPD DON EVENTUALLY RIT THI WULD TESTING RIGHTS RIGHT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WHAT STARTS OUT AS CRAZY LIKE MIKE MENCE ER STUFF OF LOW VOLUME WEIGHT TRAINING WITH HEAVY WEIGHTS IT WORK SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE HIGH VOLUME THAT ALL THAT STUFF IS BEING SHOWN TO BE TRUE IN THESE ETTE REVIEWD TRIAL SO YEW THAT'S THE NATURE OF SCIENCE IT OFTEN COMES SCIENCE OFTEN FOLLOWS THE PRACTITIONERS BY MANY DECADES YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T GET THERE FIRST BECAUSE IT'S A SLOWER MORE ITERATIVE PROCESS BUT SOME PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THOSE CLINICAL TRIALS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING SOMETHING I THINK THAT CREATIVE PROCESS IS UNIQUELY SEPARATED FROM ACADEMIC SCIENCE AND ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIP IN A WAY THAT I THINK HAS REALLY BENEFITED AM YOUMAGINET IF THE GET O BOYS HAD TO GET A DEGREE IN MUSIC THEOREE IN ORDER TO DO WHAT THEY DO THEY WEN YEOU GENTOBOYS MY OR SLAYER HEY WOULD NOT BE SLAVE YEOR PUBLIC ENEMY YEOR ADEL YEOR EMANEM AND IT'S IT'S ALMOST BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO DEGREE FOR THAT PER SAY THAT ALLOWD THEM TO DO WHAT THEY DID RIGHT ABSOLUTELY SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON SCHOOLING AND HIGHER EDUCATION OR JUST EDUCATION EM YOU WERE AT AND WY YOU WHEN YOU LAUNCH YOUR RECORD LABEL YOU GRADUATED AND WHY I DIT UM WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON GETTING OF A QOTIN QUO FORMAL EDUCATION IT SEEMS IK AN OBSLETE IDEA I THINK MAYBE THERE WAS A TIME WER WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL I MAYBE DEPENDING ON IF THE THING THAT HE WANT O STUDY  CAN ONLY BE LEARNED IN INSTITUTION MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE BUT I THINK THE REAL WORLD M GETTING AN INTERNSHIP OR A M FINDING THE RIGHT MENTOR AND GOING INTO WHATEVER THE THING IS THAT YOU'RE INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT LEARNING FROM PEOPLE WHO DO IT A SUPPOSED TO  THE THE SYSTEM I THINK I THINK MIGHT BE MORE BETTER USE OF YOUR TIME THE CREATIVE PROCESS DOESN'T EXIST IN A VACUUM AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE A HUGE PART OF LIFE ONE THING THAT I'VE HEARD YOU SAY AND THAT CERTAINLY I'VE BEEN WORKING TO INTERNALIZE S THIS IDEA THAT WHATEVER RELATIONSHIPS ONE HAS IN THEIR LIFE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT MARRIED OR NOT KIDS OR NOT THAT THE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE IS WHERE ONE'S WORK IS THE MOST DRESSFUL PART OF THEIR LIFE YES YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT YE THE HOME IS THE EM THE SAFE PLACE FROM WHICH YOU CAN GO OUT AND BE A WARRIOR AND DO ALL THESE GREAT THINGS AND THESE CRAZY THINGS YOUKNOW I HAVE UM I'M FEARLESS WHEN IT COMES TO ART I'M NOT FEARLESS WHEN IT COMES TO LIFE LIFE IS MY RELATIONSHIPS ART IS WHERE WE CAN DO THESE CRAZY THINGS AND HAVE FUN AND UM TRY EXTREME THINGS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND ITS TA SIT THAT'S A SAFE PLACE TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S JUST EXPRESSION AT'S NOT THEM THE THINGS WE MAKE DON'T HAVE TO REPRESENT WHO WE ARE THEYRE JUST THE THINGS WE MAKE AND THAT'S A POINT OF VIEWS LIKE THIS IS INTERETING TO ME IN THIS MOMENT CHECK IT OUT THAT'S ALL IT IS MAY HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FEELING TO MORROW WAT'S IN RELATIONSHIP IT'S IT'S LONG TERM HOPEFULLY AND IT'S IT'S AS LONG TERM AS IT'S PPRODTIVE RELATIONSHIP WHERE EVERYBODY IS GETTING WHAT THEY WANT FROM THAT RELATIONSHIP EVERYBODY'S NEEDS ARE BEING MET AND EVERYBODY CARES ENOUGH TO MEET EACH OTHERS NEEDS HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED HOW RATIONAL YOU ARE ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND THIS NOTION THAT LIKE IF EVERYBODY ISN'T BEING HONEST THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP ACTUALLY NOT IT'S A BAD RELATION BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY NO RELATIONSHIIP NOW BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU IF SOME ONE'S NOT TELLING THE TRUTH THEN EACH PERSON IS EXPERIENCING A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD YEU'RE LIVING INTO DIFFERENT WORLDS SO THEY'RE NOT THE'RE NEVER ACTUALLY TOGETHER WHEN YOU'RE EXPERIENCING A DIFFERENT WORLD S UNLESS YOU CAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE I'M NOT SAYING YOU ILL HAVE TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING T YOU'VE TO BE TRUTHFUL IN SAYING THIS IS HOW I SEE IT AND YOUR PARTNERIS CLEAR AND YES THIS IS HOW I SEE IT OR NO THIS IS HOW I SEE IT YOU'RE ON THE SAME YOU'RE ON THE SAME PAGE EVEN EVEN IN DISAGREEMENT BUT IT'S REAL IT'S YOUR YOUR BEING WHO EACH OF YOURE BEING WHO YOU ARE FOR AND WITH THE OTHER BUT IF YOU'RE NOT OPENING YOURSELF UP IN THAT WAY TO YOUR PARTNER YOU'REIN A DIFFERENT WORLD THEY HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT BEING TOGETHER NO MASKS NO NO IT'S IT'S THE SAME AS WHEN YOU SAID EARLIER ABOUT LYING IN YOUR DIARY YOU'D ONLY BE DOING IT A SERVICE TO YOURSELF LYING IN A RELATIONSHIP WOULD ONLY BE DOING IT A SERVICE TO YOURSELF MIGNASK OF SOCIAL DISTORTION AS A SONG CALLED CHEATING IT SLITAIRE WHICH SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE TITLE TO MENTION RIGHT NOW AN LYING IN THE DIARY CHEATING IT SOLITAIRE 'S RIDICULOUS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE NO YOURE NOT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME DOYOU KNON'T I MEAN IF YOU'RE CHEATING AT IT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME THE WHOLE POINT OF THE GAME IS THE GAME IF YOU CHEAT AT IT YOU'RE NOT PLAYING THE GATE DO YOU HAVE ANY MUST READ BOOKS FOR PEOPLE I'LL ALL THROW ONE OUT RICKS BOOK ON THE CREATIVE ACT  A WAY OF BEING A BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT BOOK WHAT ARE SOME BOOKS THAT YOU RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE FOR STIMULATING THOUGHT OR FOR A I I DON'T KNOW HEALTH PURPOSES OR THINGS THAT YOU FOUND PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL IND BOOK FOR MY FAVORITE BOOK ABOUT MEDITATION IS CALLED WHEREVER YOU GO THERE YOU ARE AND I JUST GOT SENT THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY EDITION WHICH IS COMPLETELY REWRITTEN I HAVE NOT YET READ THE RETHE REWRITTEN VERSION BUT I LOVE THE ORIGINAL VERSION AND I KNOW THE REWRITTEN VERSION I'M GUESSING THAT THE REWRITTEN VERSION IS JUST MORE REFINED AND EVEN BETTER SUCH A GREAT BOOK THAT BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ME Y WHEN I WAS BOUT FOURTEEN AND A HALF  WHEN I WAS A RELEASED FROM A PARTICULARLY UNCOMFORTABLE NONVAN VOLUNTARY UM A STATE OF AFFAIRS AND IF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT BOOK THAT HELP ME THROUGH SO MANY YEARS OF LIFE AND I HAVE TO GO BACK TO IS THIS MOUNTAIN VISUALIZATION MEDITATION BEING A MOUNTAIN I DON'T KNOWHY I WAS SO HELPFUL BUT GOODNESS WAS IT HELPFUL FOR  M A BEAUTIFUL IDEA IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA IKNOW I THOUGHT OF THAT JUST NOW BUT I'M TO GO BACK AND READ IT DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S GENETIC APIGENETIC FAMILY LINEAGE STOFF UNRELATED TO GENETICS THAT LEADS US TO CREATE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY ABOUT LIKE OUR ANCESTORS YOU KNOW THE FOR INSTANCE AM IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AH LET'S TAKE LET'S TAKE JOHNNY CASH FOR INSTANCE OR AN ARTIST SAVE YOU WORKED WITH MORE RECENTLY CHILLY PAPPERS THAT WHEN THEY GOT TOGETHER TO MAKE MUSIC THAT SOMETHING FROM ANTHONY'S FAMILY LINE WAS BEING TRANSMUTED THROUGH HIM INT INTO THE SONGS AH N IS THAT HAPPENING DO YOU THING THAT WE CAN WORK OUT AND AND INCLUDE THINGS THAT ARE GENERATIONS FAR BACK ENOUGH THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO THEM I M IT'S COMING THROUGH IN OURGENES I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE BUT I I DON'T THINK WE CAN KNOW AND I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY EVEN HELPFUL TO KNOW IT JUST IS ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS THINGS I DON'T THINK WE KNOW WHY WE DO MANY O THE THINGS WE DO AND IT'S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT AND THAT'S PPOSSIBLE FURY TOU EXPLAIN WHY WE DO THE THINGS WE DO MAYBE BUT THERE MAY BE ANOTHER ONE IT MAY BE A UEFOS ARE CONTROLLING US I DON'T KNOW DO YOU KNOW AT I'M SAYINGITS IT COULD BE ANYTHING THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE INTERTHAT THINGS THAT SEUEFOS THAT ARE CONTROLLING I I WOULDN'T AM I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH THAT MORE OR MORE EVIDENCE IS COMING OUT THAT YOU KNOW THATA UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS MIGHT WHINT I SHOULD BE A DOCUMENTED PHENOMENON BY THE YOU MUS GOVERNMENT I HAVEN'T LOOKED INTO IT YET BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED WHEN YOU WERE ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE AND ON SEVERAL OTHER PODCAST YOU MENTION THAT YOU DON'T PLAY MUSIC AT LEAST NOT ROUTINELY A YOU DON'T PLAY AN INSTRUMENT UN THAT YOU HAVE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF HOW A SOUND BOARD WORKS SO WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO ARTIST ARE YOU LISTENING FOR SOMETHING OR YOUR STAYING OPEN FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT HERE LIKE IT THAT THAT WILL TRIGGER A CERTAIN STATE IN YOU THAT YOU RECOGNIZE I'M OPENED JUST SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING LIKE I I FEEL WHAT'S I I LISTEN AND RECOGNIZE IS THITS MAKING ME LEAN FORWARD AM I CURIOUS TO SEE WHATS CAN HAPPEN NEXT IS HIT THING THAT HAPPENS NEXT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS CAN HAPPEN NEXT THAT COULD BE INTERESTING OU I LISTEN ALOUT OF MUSIC WHEN IT DOESN'T DO WHAT'S EXPECTED THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING SPECIALLY IF IT SOUNDS GOOD FOR WORKS UM I'M JUST OPEN TO EXPRENCING WHAT IT IS AND I'LL SAY SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT IT WHICH IS THIS THIS SLL SOUND A MYSTICAL I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT OFTEN YOU CAN TELL LOT ABOUT THE PIECE OF MUSIC YIGAN ALISTEN TO BASED ON THE FIRST SOUND YOU HEAR LIKE THE FIRST MOMENT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT NO OD IT IS IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT INSTRUMENT IT IS IT'S AH INTENTION IN THE PERFORMANCE AND THAT PERFORMANCE COULD EVEN BE A MACHINE THE WAY WHEN SOMETHING STARTS SOMETIMES IS IS FEELING OF UP THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD JUST OUT OF THE BON'T THE DOWN BE CAN'T EXPLAIN REMINDS ME OF DATIN AND YOU KNOW WITHIN HALF A NAN O SECOND LIKE THI'S GOIN TO BE A FUN NIGHT TO BE INTERESTING NIHT THIS PERSON'S INTERESTING OR BOUQUET THIS IS NOT A NIGHT TO CONTINUE RIH AT ANOTHER SOMETHING AN AND IT'S NOT WHAT SAID NECESSARILY OR EVEN HOW IT'S SAID JUST IT'S A IT'S A THE FEELING I KNOW THAT DEPENDING ON HOW I'M FEELING I'LL AVOID LISTENING CRITICALLY TO SOMETHING FI'M NOT FEELING WELL IF I'M IF I DON'T FEE LIKE I CAN BE COMPLETELY THERE AN OPEN I'LL NOT LISTEN I I KNOW I KNOW I WANT E REALLY BE THERE FOR THE THING THAT I'M 'LL LISTENING TO DO YOU INFORM PEOPLE IF LIKE I 'M NOT HERE TO DAY LIKE A I CAN'T SOMETIMES YET SOMETIMES AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS NEVER BEEN PART OF THE MUSIC PRODUCTION PROCESS HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE LIKE FOR AN ALBUM IKE ELL LET'S THROW OUT AN ARTIST OF WORSHIPS LIKE YOU WERE TO THEMINEM HOW LONG DID THAT BUT YOU DID SOME SONGS ON THAT ALBUMER THE WHOLE LBAIS THEM SONGS SO DID HE COME IN WITH THOSE WRITTEN AND THEN YOU GOTS WORK TOGETHER ON THOS SONGS HOW LONG WAS THAT A WEEK A MONTH A DAY I THINK WE WERE TOGETHER FOR SEVERAL WEEKS IT'S BEEN LOW ENOUGH NOW THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE SPECIFICS BUT THERE THERE IS NO RULE OF HOW THAT WORKS AND SOMETIMES THINGS COME TOGETHER VERY QUICKLY AND HOW CAN BE MADE IN A WEEKEND AND SOME ALBUMS ARE YEARS IN THE MAKING WHEN IT'S USE IN THE MAKING IT'S REARELY EVERY DAY FOR YEARS IN THE MAKING IT'S USUALLY MORE EPISOTIC BUT THERE IS SOMETHING BOTH VERSIONS ARE VERY INTERESTING AND IT SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT ALMOST FULLY FORMED VERY QUICKLY HAS PARTICULAR ENERGY AND THEN SOMETHING TIT'S MADE OVER TIME CAN HAVE ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL MOMENTES ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAPPEN WITHIN YOU OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME THOSE CAN ALL BE REFLECTED IN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DAILY DIARY JOURNAL AND READING THREE MONTHS IT'S DIFFERENT THER TWO DIFFERENT THINKGS CAN'T SAY ONE'S BETTER THAN THE OTHER THEY'RE JUST TO DIFFERENT THINGS SO SOME PROJECTS ARE MORE LIKE A YEARS DIARY AND SOME ARE MORE LIKE A WEAKEND ITS SAME YOU KOW YOU WATCH A MOVI SO MOVIS THE MOVING STORY TAKES PLACE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND SOMETIMES IT'S A PERSON'S LIFETIME ONE'S NOT BETTER THAN THE AONE'S NOT A BETTER METHOD THAN THE OTHER IT'S WHATEVER SUITS THE WORK SPEAKING OF YOUR WORK WITH THEM AN EM BUT ALSO WITH JASE AND W TH BSY BOYS AND OTHERS YOU ARE FEATURED IN A NUMBER OF THE VIIOS YOU SHOW UP IN THOSE VIDIOS WHOSE DECISION WAS THAT AND ON WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON MUSIC VIDIOS I REMEMBER WHEN MUSIC VIDIOS FIRST CAME OUT OH EMPTY THE ERRA AND JUST THING LIKE THIS IS SOCAL I CAN SEE THE ARTISTS SEE HOW THERE DRAST  THE LIKE THE CRAZY STYLES AND ALL OF THAT THAT ACCOMPANIY THE MUSIC TWO QUESTIONS ONE WHOSE DECISION WAS IT TO BE IN THE VIOS HIT'S PREDUCERS OFTEN ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE VIDIOS YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE IF THE ARTISTS ASK THEY'D BE THE ONLY REASON WOULD BE THERE AND TOO O WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON MUSIC VIDIOS AND THE IDEA THAT THEN IT PUTS A VERY STRONG VISUAL TO THE THE SONG WHEREAS WERE THERE NOT TO BE EVIDIO PEOPLE COUD JUST IMAGINE SOMETHING BASED ON WHAT THEYRE HEARING AND HEARING ALONE THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT THEIR TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IS NOT A BETTER OR WORSE OR SOMETIMES WHERE THE VIDIO MAKES THE SONG BETTER AND THERE'S OFTEN THE CASE WHERE THE POETRY OF THE WORDS AH IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES AND LISTEN TO WHAT THE WORDS ARE AS E LISTENER YOU GET TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT IN CREATING THAT WORLD IN YOUR HEAD SO IIS SOMETIMES PHOTOGRAPHS CAN TELL US TOO MUCH INFORMATION IT'S TOO LEADING IT LIMITS THE STORY TO JUST THIS PHOTOGRAPH THE PHOTOGRAPH TELLS YOU MUCH MORE THAN THE WORDS THE WORDS CAN BE INTERPRETED IN MANY WAYS AND THEN WE EACH GET TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE IT'S SOMETHING IN THE BOOK THAT I WAS A COGNISANT OF IN PICKING THE WORDS WAS NEVER TO BE SPECIFIC TO THE POINT OF WHERE THE READER DOESN'T GET TO PAR TICIPATE IN THIS ACT SO IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT TO THINK IT'S AN INVITATION TO THINK IT'S AN INVITATION TO SAY WHERE AM I IN THIS WHAT'S MY VERSION OF THIS IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYONE ELSE IT'S ABOUT THE READER AND THAT WAS SOME IT WAS AL FROM THE BEGINNING THAT WAS ALWAYS PART OF THE UM MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE THE MOST HELPFUL THE COVER CERTAINLY EMBODIES THAT THAT IT IT'S NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE COVER DESIGN IS COATING WAT SUPPOST TO BE IT'S HELP INTO ANTELURTATION INTERPRETED AS YOU WISH AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE SEE DIFFERENT THINGS LET'S GET CURRENT WHAT WHAT AR YOU WORKING ON NOW THAT YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT IF YOU CAN SHARE YOU SEE WHAT I CAN CAN'T SHARE CULD BE BROADCATEGORIES OF THINGS TOO BELCAN I'M WORKING ON A COUPLE OF UM  DOCUMENTARY PROJECTS THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT AND SOME ALBUMS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON OVER TIME OR ARE COMING OUT IM ONE IS A CREDIBLE SINGER GATARTPLAY IN A MARKES KING HIS ALTUMS ABOUT TO COME OUT I THE GOSSIP IS A BAND THAT I MAY NABUM WITH TEN YEARS AGO AND WE JUST MADE A NEW ALBUM OR WE MADE AN ALBUM MAY BE EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO AND THAT'S COMING OUT NOW UM THOSE ARE THE FIRST ONES THAT COME TO MINE IS THE DOCUMENTARY PROCESS FUN FOR YOU AND HOW HOW DO YOU APPROACH THAT I WATCH A LOT OF DOCUMENTARIES TO LEARN WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN INSPIRED WHT MAY BE SOME CASES WHERE I GET INSPIRED BY WHAT I'M SEEING BUT MORE OFTEN I SEES THINGS AND A SALCA THESE DOCUMENTARIES ALL HAVE THIS FORMAT SO I KNOWI DON'T WANT IT TO BE THIS FORMAT UM 'S MORE OF A RULING OUT AND IT'S FUN TO FIND NEW WAYS THAT REVIEW DIFFERENT INFORMATION THAN THE STANDARD FOR  MADELOUSE INTERESTING TO ME ICT WILL SEE IF ANYONE ELSE CARCE YOU HAVE AN UNIQUE APPROACH TO PODCASTING I FIRST ALL WHATEVER YOU'R CRICHERIA FOR HER YOU INVITE ON AS A GUAST AND SECOND IM WHAT D YOU HAVE IN MIND WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND PODCAST M I HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT YOUR IN ANSWER BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I'M NOT INJACT IN THAT D I THINK PEOPLE ARE INGEDIN THIS EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT A PODCAST BECAUSE I THINK IT IT GETS TO THE PROCESS OF SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE DOING NOW AND HOW YOU'RE DOING IT NOW YE IM I DIDN'T SET OUT TO DO WHAT I'VE ABOUT TO TELL YOU I DN'T SET OUT TO DO THIS BUT IT SOMETHING THAT AFTER I STARTED DOING IT I CAME TO REALIZE IT'S AN INTERESTING THING AND ACTUALLY LEARN THIS FROM LISTENING TO YOU'RE PODCAST WHOS ACTUALLY LEXAS PODCAST WITH YOU AND I WAS LISTENING TO THE PODCAST AND I KNOW YOU KNOW LEX AND I KNOW YOU AS A FRIENDS AND BOTH OF YOU IN ADDITION TO YOU TALKING THE LEX YOU'RE TALKING OF THE AUDIENCE AND LEX IN ADDITION TO TALKING TO YOU TALKS TO THE AUDIENCE AND THE AUDIENCE WAS A PARTICIPANT IN YOUR CONVERSATION AND I REALIZE THAT IN IT THE TETROGRAMATIN PODCAST IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THAT IT'S MO ORE OF AN INTIMAT PERSONAL LIKE THE INTERVIEW WITH YOU THAT HASN'T COME OUT YET THAT WAS ME TALKING TO YOU WITH NO I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA THAT ANYBODY ELSE WAS CAN TO HEAR IT OTHER THAN YES SOMEONE ELSE'S CAN TO HEAR IT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS IS IS I WAS ASKING TO QUESTIONS I WAS INTERESTED IN AND I WANTED TO LEARN AS MUCH AS I COULD AND IF YOU SAID SOMETHING EITHER THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND I ESS YOUD T EXPLAIN IT OR IF YOU TOLD ME STORY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT SENT ME ON A TANGENT THAT WOULD I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS LEFT SIDE OF WHAT YOU SAID OR THE RIGHT SIDE OF WHAT YOU SAID I WOULD ASK BUT ONLY FOLLOWING MY OWN INTEREST SO IT HAS A AN INTIMACY IT'S TURNED INTO WHEN I IF I LISTENED TO A TEDROGRAMAT IN PODCAST IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M OVERHEARING A CONVERSATION A PERSONAL CONVERSATION AND IT IT HAS TURNED INTO PARTS OF CERTAIN DECISIONS WE'VE MADE LIKE HAVING THERE'S MUSIC AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN YOU HEAR THE GUEST MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORY AND IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU'VE WALKED INTO A ROOM AND PEOPLE ARE IN THIS DEEP CONVERSATION AND YOU JUST SITTING ON THE SIDE QUIETLY IN HEARING THIS CONVERSATION AND IT'S A REAL MOMENT THAT'S HAPPENING THERE AND IT'S JUST DIFFERENT I CAN'T SAY IT'S BETTER CAN'T SAY IT'S WORSE CAN'T SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT IT BUT SOMETHING ABOUT IT'S INTERESTING TO ME AND WHEN I LISTENED TO IT I FEEL A DIFFERENT KIND OF AN INTIMACY I'M AND AGAIN IT WASN'T PREMEDITATED THIS IS AFTER THE FACT I'M LOOKING ABACK AND UNDERSTANDIN OH THIS IS WHAT IT IS THIS IS WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT YET THE PODCAST THAT I DID WITH YOU ON YOUR PODCAST WHEN I WAS FEATURED AS A GEST THE SECOND TIME I I COMPLETELY FORGOT THAT WE WERE PODCASTING IT WAS ALSO GOOD WE'D HAD A FEW DAYS TOGETHER OVERSEES THERE WE'RE IN A VERY ON ACCOUNT OF ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT THAT HELPED ME GET OUT OF THE MODE OF THERE ARE LISTENERS NOW THERE'S NO THERE'S NO SENSE OF PERFORMANCE INVOLVED IT'S IT COULDN'T BE MORE CASUAL AND THE REASON I CHOSE NOT TO FILMENT IS BECAUSE THE NATURE OVE LIGHT'S AND CAMERAS MAKE IT HARDER TO FORGET THAT YOU'RE DOING IT SO I AIM FOR IT TO BE AS I NATURAL AN EXPERIENCE SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU REALLY WOULD HAVE IF THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN CAMERAS NOT THAT NOT THAT ONT TO REVEAL ANYTHING IT'S JUST IT'S A LEVEL OF COMFORT AND OPENNESS WHERE YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEBODY LIKENS YOU'RE ENJOYING THE CONVERSATION AND THAT SO YOU I JUST HAVE TO SHA R THAT YOU ADE THE FIRST TIME WE MET IN PERSON YOU AND I HAD FACED TIME TO NUMBER OF TIMES PREVIOUS TO THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE MET IN PERSON CAME OVER YOUR HOUSE WE ENDED UP DOING SONA AND COLD AND I WAS GOING THROUGH A PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TIME IN MY LIFE I MEAN IT DID REALLY JUST HIT ME SQUARE IN THE FACE AND I REMEMBER SAYING HAYLISS AND I I DON'T NO WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS BUT I JUST OPENED UP ABOUT ALL F IT AND THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN LIKE WE WOERE TOT BECOME FRIENDS ANYWAY BUT THAT'S WHERE T THINGS REALLY TO COFF CAS I KEPT APOLOGIZEING AT THE AND I'M SO SORRY YOU SAID NO NO THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE SPOST TO DO AND YOU KNOW I'M FEEL VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE'VE REMAIN CLOSE FRIENDS EVER SINCE AND THAT CATALIZED A LOT BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT PODCASTS NOT JUST PODCASTING BUT PODCASSIS THAT THE REALLY A FACTIVE PODCAST LIKE YOURS LIKES LIKESES LIKE ROGUE AND LIKE RITROLL TIM FERRIS DID THEY REALLY REFLECT THE LOVE AND PASSION THAT THE PERSON HAS FOR THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION I MAN I CAN CERTAINLY SAY THIS ABOUT MY PODCASSIT IE BEEN LEARNING ORGANIZING AND DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION SINCE I WAS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW SIX YEARS OLD SO MY PODCAST IS JUST THAT YOU YOU LIKE REAL CONVERSATION AND REAL THINGS THAT ARE UNBURRIERED BY LIKE THE IDEA THAT MAY BE SOME ONE CAN LISTEN AND HOWLL IT WORK OUT JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND YOU ANSWERD THE QUESTIONS THAT WAY AND I THINK LACKS LIKES LIKES HIS FORM OF THING AND JOE IS DOING HIS FORM OF THING AND I THINK THT'S TO ME ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS OF PODCASTING IF ANY ONE WANTS TO KNOW HOW TO CREATE US SUCCESSFUL PODCASTS QUOT IN QUOTE SUCCESSFUL IT'S HAVE THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS AND TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU REALLY LOVE LIKE CAMERON HAINES AS AS LIFT RUN SHOOT PODCASTS WHERE YOU GO TO HIS HOUSE YOU WOULD DO A WORK OUT THEN YOU GO FOR A RUN AND THEN HE TEACHES YOU ARCHERY AND THE REASON IT'S SO EFFECTIVE IS THAT HE LOVES LIFTING RUNNING AND SHOOTING AND THEN HE IS OMEST ANHY LOVES TEACHING PEOPLE THAT SO THE END OF THE DAY YOU'RE SITTING DOWN TALKING ABOUT A GREAT DAY THAT EEMBODIES EVERYTHING THAT HE'S ABOUT IN AND THE PERSON LEARNED AND THAT I COULDN'T DO THAT PODCAST I CAN GO ON AS A GUEST AND I LOVED BEING GUEST BUT I THINK THAT'S THE MESSAGE AND IT BRINGS US BACK TO WHAT YOU'RE TIME OUT EARLIER AND THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION JUST THAT IF

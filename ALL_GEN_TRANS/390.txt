PREMIUM SUBSCRIBER IS FORE YOU SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S GET TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THE FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT CRADUM AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE SHORT AND LONG TERM EFFECTS OF TAKING CRADUM FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVEN'T HEARD OF CRATUM CRATUM AS A SUBSTANCE THAT COMES FROM A TREE THAT GROWS NATURALLY IN INDONESIA THE TRE ELF IS CALLED MITROGINA SPECIOSA AND IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS OR MORE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW LONG BUT AT LEAST FOR A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS THAT WHEN PEOPLE CHEW THE LEAVES OF THIS TREE THEY EXPERIENCE A MILD STIMULANT EFFECT AND THERE'S ALSO A PROCESS OF EXTRACTION WHEREBY YOU CAN TAKE THE LEAVES AND GET HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF CRADUM THAT NOWADAYS AS PACKAGED INTO VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS MOST OFTEN CONSUMED IN CAPSAL FORM ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES IT SOLD IN RAW POWDER FORM HERE'S THE KEYTHINGE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT CRADUM INDEED AT LOW DOSAGES CRADUM HAS A MILD STIMULANT EFFECT HOWEVER AT HIER DOSAGES IT HAS WHAT'S CALLED AN ANALGESIC EFFECT THAT IS A PAIN KILLING EFFECT AND IT ACTS AS A SEDATIVE AND CRADAM ITSELF ACTS AS AN OPIOID IN THE BODY THIS IS WHAT'S MAKING CRADUM A VERY CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC THESE DAYS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF THE SO CALLED OPIOID CRISIS THE OPIOID CRISIS HAS BEEN A TERM COIN TO LARGELY CENTRE AROUND ISSUES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES ALTHOUGH THESE ISSUES DEFINITELY EXTEND BEYOND THE BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES BUT THE OPIOID CRISIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE OVER CONSUMPTION AND WIDESPREAD ADDICTION TO OPIOIDS OPIOIDS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE MORPHINE OXY CODONE ALSO CALLED OXY CONTIN AND THERE ARE OTHER OPIOID SIMILAR TO THOSE COMPOUNDS ALL OF WHICH HAVE THE GENERAL EFFECT OF BEING PAIN KILLERS AND SEDATIVES AND IN SOME PEOPLE AGAIN SOME PEOPLE ELICITING A SENSE OF EUPHORIA IN PARTICULAR AT LOW TO MODERATE DOSAGES HOWEVER PEOPLE QUICKLY DEVELOP A TOLERANCE TO THOSE DRUGS AND NEED TO CONSUME MORE AND MORE OF THEM IN ORDER TO GET THE EFFECT THAT THEY INITIALLY GOT FROM A LOWER DOSAGE AND THEY ARE NOT JOUS HIGHLY HABIT FORMING THEY ARE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE AND WE CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HABIT FORMING AN ADDICTIVE BY SIMPLY SAYING THAT ADDICTIVE MEANS PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING DESPITE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCIS THERE ARE OTHER RELEVANT DEFINITIONS O VEDICTION AS WELL I DEFINE THE DICTION MORE BROADLY AS THE PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE THINGS THAT GIVE YOU PLEASURE AND INDEED WHEN PEOPLE GET ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS IT IS A VERY BAD PICTURE IT OFTEN HAMPERS MANY MANY AREAS OF THEIR LIVES AND SERIOUSLY SO SO THE OPIOID CRISIS REFERS TO THE OVER PRESCRIPTION OF OPIOI DRUGS THAT SORT OF WHAT IT GENERALLY TAKEN TO MEAN BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES ACCESSING OPIOIDS SUCH AS MRPHINE OXY CODONE ET CETERA THROUGH GRAY MARKET SOURCES THROUGH BLACK MARKET SOURCES AND ON AND ON AND OF COURSE THE ACQUISITION OF THE DRUGS IS JUST ONE PIECE IT'S ALSO THE OVER CONSUMPTION OF THOSE DRUGS AND OF COURSE THE ADDICTION TO THOSE DRUGS WHICH HAS PROVED TO BE SO PERNICIOUS SO WHAT IS THIS APT TO DO WITH CRATAM CRADTAM IS ALSO IN OPIOID AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW IT DIFFERS IN ITS OPIOID PROPERTIES FROM THE DRUGS I JUST TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT FROM MORPHINE AND HYDROCODONE BUT IT ALSO HAS SOME SIMILAR PROPERTIES AS WELL BUT THE DEAL WITH CRATAM IS THAT A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE MANAGED TO WEAN THEMSELVES OFF OPIOID SUCH AS MORPHINE AND HYDROCODON THROUGH THE USE OF RATAM AND THAT HAS BEEN USED AS JUSTIFICATION FOR KEEPING CRATUM ON THE MARKET IN KEEPING IT LEGAL HOWEVER AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT HOWEVER CRATAM ITSELF HAS ALSO PROVED TO BE NOT ONLY HABIT FORMING BUT ADDICTIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN TAKEN AT DOSAGES THAT EXCEED THAT LOWER DOSE THAT JUST GENERALLY CREATES A BIT OF STIMULANE TO LITTLE BIT OF EUPHORIC EFFECT WHEN PEOPLE START TAKING HYRODOSAGES OF CRATUM IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT IT DOES BECOME ADDICTIVE AND ITSELF IS VERY HARD TO COME OFF OF SO MUCH SO THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SO CALLED CRATUM WITH DRAWL NOW THE REASON I MENTION THAT CRATUM HAS BEEN USED BY GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO WEAN THEMSELVES OFF OF THE MORE POTENT FORMS OF PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS IS THAT WHEN I SOLICITED FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT CRATUM ON SOCIAL MEDIA IT WAS A VERY BINARY RESPONSE IN FACT THERE WAS ONE CAMP A VERY RABID CAMP THAT SAID CRADOM IS TERRIBLE I TOOK THIS STUFF I GOT ADDICTED IT WAS EXTREMELY HARD TO COME OFF OF THERE WERE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS IN THEIR SUCH AS I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO LITERALLY HAD TO GO TO REHAB BECAUSE OF CRADEM WHO DEVELOPED A BUNCH OF OTHER ADDICTIONS BECAUSE OF CRADEM ESSENTIALLY MANY MANY RESPONSES OF PEOPLE WHO HAD ONLY BAD EXPERIENCES WITH CRADEM MEANING THEY LIKED IT ENOUGH AT FIRST THAT THEY CONTINUED TO TAKE IT AND IT BECAME ADDICTIVE FOR THEM OR SOMEBODY THAT THEY KNOW HOWEVER THERE WAS ANOTHER CAMP THAT WAS EQUALLY VOCAL WHICH KEPT SAYING NO IF ONE REALLY ADHERES TO THE LOWER DOSAGES OF CRADM CRADEM ITSELF CAN BE A USEFUL TOOL FOR GETTING OFF OTHER OPIOIDS AND THERE WERE EVEN A FEW BONIFIED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS MEDICAL DOCTORS THAT IS AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW THEM IN THEIR REPUTATIONS AS QUITE GOOD WHO CHIMED IN AND SORT OF RECONCILE THE TWO CAMPS BY SAYING INDEED IF ONE CAN AVOID TAKING CRADTEM AT ALL YOU SHOULD THERE IS NO REASON TO TAKE THIS THING THINKING THAT IT'S COULDN'T GOOD FOR YOU YOU WOULD BE WISE TO AVOID TAKING IT BECAUSE THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY IF YOU TAKE IT AT A GIVEN DOSAGE OR AT ADOSAGE THAT IS GOING TO GET YOUR BRAIN AND BODY INTO A STATE OF EUPHORIA AND OLGESIA AND THE SORT OF CLASSIC OPIOID EFFECT THAT IT'S GOING TO BECOME HABIT FORMING AREDICTING FOR YOU THAT SAID THESE SAME MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY KNEW MANAGED TO GET OFF OF THE MORE POTENT FORMS OF OPIOID SUCH AS MORPHINE OXY CODONE AND SO FORTH USING CRADEM AND THEY SAID WELL IF IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN BEING ADDICTED TO MORPHINE AND HYDROCODO N VERSES TAKING CRADEM AND ADDICTED TO THOSE SUBSTANCES AND CRADEM SOMEHOW ALLOWED THEM TO TAPEER OFF OF THOSE SUBSTANCES THAT THEY WOULD LOOK MORE FAVORABLY UPON CRADEM IF AND ONLY IF THEY WOULD ALSO COMMIT TO PROGRESSIVELY LOWERING THEIR DOSE OF CRADEM AND EVENTUALLY COMING OFF OF CRADEM SO THE GENERAL TAKE AWAY FROM ALL THAT IS IF YOU CAN AVOID TAKING CRADEM MEANING IF YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN IT ALREADY DON'T AND THAT REMINDS ME OF A VERY IMPORTANT POINT WOULD A GUEST ON THE HUBORMANLAB POKKASKED DOCTOR ROBERT MERLANKA WHO SAY EMDY AND PACESE MY COLLIGET STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IS A WORLD EXPERT ON THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING ADDICTION AND DOPOMINE AND DRUG REINFORCEMENT AMONG MONEY OTHER THINGS WHAT HE SAID ON THE PODCAST IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE WHICH IS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ADDICTED TO A SUBSTANCE THAT YOU'VE NEVER CONSUMED THAT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS BUT THINK ABOUT THAT ONE AGAIN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ADDICTED TO A SUBSTANCE THAT YOU'VE NEVER CONSUMED SO I THINK THE SAFEST STATEMENT TO MAKE IS IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED CRATEM YOU WOULD BE WISE TO AVOID IT BECAUSE YOU STAND A CHANCE TO BECOME ADDICTED TO IT IF HOWEVER YOU ARE SOMEBODY THAT'S ADDICTED TO OTHER FORMS OF OPIOIDS YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD TALK YOUR PHYSICION ABOUT THAT AND HOW TO GET OFF OF THOSE OPIOIDS BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE USED CRATEM TO SUCCESSFULLY WEEN THEMSELVES OFF THE MORE POTENT FORMS OF OPIOIDS THAT I TALKED ABOUT NAMELY MORPHINE AND HYDROCODONE AS WELL AS A FEW OTHERS NOW IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO ALREADY TAKES CRATEM YOU NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE DOSAGE THAT YOU TAKE AND YOU ALSO NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DIFFERED TROMATICALLY IN THEIR RESPONSE TO OPIOIDS THIS IS O SO IMPORTANT AND PEOPLE DO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS ENOUGH WE HEAR FOR INSTANCE THAT OH YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE ARE TAKING ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO FIVE GRAHAMS MAY BE ONE TO SIX CRAMS OF CRATE TO PER DAY THAT'S KEEPING IT IN THE DOSAGE RANGE FOR WHICH PEOPLE DON'T GENERALLY TEND TO GET ADDICTED YOU'LL HEAR THINGS LIKE THAT AND BY THE WAY WHEN I SAY ONE TO FIVE OR ONE TO SIX GRAMS PER DAY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS THAT ARE PRESENT IN CRATEM THEIRE COUPLE DIFFERENT PLANT ALKALOIDS I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT THAT ARE PRESENT IN CRATEM AND THESE HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON THE OPIOID SYSTEM SO NOWADAYS SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT SELL CRATEM AND BY THE WAY THATS ASSOLD OVER THE COUNTER AS A SUPPLEMENT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE PRESCRIPTION TO PURCHASE AT LEAST AT THIS POINT IN TIME IN THE UNITED STATES SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS WE'LL HAVE A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF ONE OR THE OTHER ALKALLOIDS WITHIN THEM SUCH THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY COMPARE ONE GRAHAM OF ONE BRAND OF CRATEM TO ONE GRAHAM OF ANOTHER BRAND OF CRATUM BECAUSE THEY CAN HAVE WILDLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THESE DIFFERENT ALKALOIDS AND THESE DIFFENT ALKALOIDS HAVE WILDLY DIFFERENT IMPACT ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY BIOLOGY IN PARTICULAR HOW MUCH THEY TEND TO IMPACT THE SO CALLED IN DOGENOUS OPIOID SYSTEM OCASE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DOSAGES WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS IN THE BACK OF OUR MIND IN WE HAVE TO KEEP IN THE BACK OF OUR MIND THET THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A SUB GROUP OF PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THIS SUB GROUP OF PEOPLE IS BUT WE KNOW IT'S NOT EVERY ONE BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND FORTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO RESPOND TO OPIOIDS IN A PARTICULARLY POTENT WAY THEY REALLY LIKE THEM AND PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THAT CATEGORY DON'T TEND TO LIKE OPIOIDS I CAN CERTAINLY SAY THAT I AM SOMEBODY WHO WHEN I'VE BEEN PERSCRIBED THINGS LIKE VIKEDIN OR ANY OTHER OPIOID POST SURGERY FOR PAIN I HATE TAKING THOSE STROGS I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT I'D RATHER DEAL WITH THE PAIN THEY MAKE ME NAUCIOUS THEY MAKE ME FEEL TERRIBLE THAT' SAID I KNOW PEOPLE WHO LOVE OPOIDS IT'S LIKE A NATURAL FIT FOR THEIR CHEMISTRY IN THE SENSE THAT IT TENDS TO EVOKE MORE EUPHORIA THEY JUST IMMEDIATELY LIKE THE FEELING SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THE EPISODE OF THE HUBRUMAN LAPODCAST THAT IT DID ABOUT ALKOHOL AND THERE TOO I DISCUSS THE FACT THAT ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE WHO CONSUME ALKOHOL YET AN INCREASE DOPAMINE RESPONSE TO ALKOHOL THAT'S NOT OBSERVED IN OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT PARTICULAR SUB GROUP OF PEOPLE IS VERY VERY AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING ALKOHOL USED DISORDER SOMETIMES CALLED ALKOHOLISM BECAUSE THEY CAN DRINK IN A WAY AND THEY EXPERIENCE A HIGH FROM DRINKING IN A WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE SIMPLY DO NOT EXPERIENCE NOW LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IF THEY CONSUME TO MUCH ALKHOL THEY GET DRUNK SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DRUNK EFFECT IT'S ABOUT THE DOPAOMINE AND OTHER SORTS OF CHEMICALS THAT ARE RELEASED IN THOSE PEOPLE IN RESPONS TO ALKHOL THAT OTHER PEOPLE JUST DON'T SEEM TO EXPERIENCE AT THE SAME LEVEL OF POTENCY SO AGAIN WITH THINGS LIKE CRADEM AND THE OTHER OPOIDS THERE'S A CATEGORY OF PEOPLE AND IT'S A MUCH LARGER CATEGORY OF PEOPLE GAN TEN TO FORTY PER CENT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY BECAUSE THE STUDIES ARE NOT REALLY COMPLETED N THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF THOSE STUDIES YET UNFORTUNATELY BUT WHEN THOSE PEOPLE TAKE AN OPIOID WO O WOW DO THEY LIKE IT AND THOSE PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR ARE VERY MUCH AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING AN ADDICTION TO OPIOIDS AND SO THOSE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY SHOULD NEVER EVER GO NEAR CRADUM IF THEY HAVEN'T OR IF THEY ARE ALREADY TAKING CRADEM THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSTANTLY RACHETING UP THEIR DOSE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT TELL YOU NOW I'M NOT ADDICTED BUT IF YOU WERE TO SAY HEY ALL RIGHT WELL THEN LET'S DO AN EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU DON'T TAKE CRADUM FOR A WEEK THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUDDENLY GOING TO GET ANXIOUS ABOUT THE MERE IDEA OF THAT I'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS IN REFERENCE TO CANABAS WHEN I DID IN EPISODE ABOUT CANABAS GEND I'M NOT PUTTING A BLANKET' STATEMENT OUT THERE ABOUT CANABAS AS BEING GOOD OR BAD ON THAT EPISODE I TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT CANABAS DOES INDEED HAVE VERY STERAPEUTIC USES BUT THAT THERE ARE GOOD NUMBER PEOPLE WHO RELY ON CANABAS FOR ANXIETY CONTROL AND OTHER WAYS OF MODULATING THEIR BRAIN CHEMISTRY AND BODILY CHEMISTRY SUCH THAT IF YOU WERE TO SAY HEY ARE YOU ADDICTED TO CANABAST THEY SAY NO I DON'T HAVE TO SMOTE CANABAS OWN AVE TO TAKE MY EDIBLES BUT IF YOU WERE TO PUSH THEM ELOBIT AND SAY ARE IGHT WILL THEN N WET'S DO AN EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU DON'T CONSUME ANY CANABAS IN ANY FORM FOR TEN DAYS THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF THAT EXPERIMENT AT ALL SO MUCH SO THAT WERE THEY TO RUN THAT EXPERIMENT THEY WOULD EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDICTION SO I CAN'T IN GOOD FAITH SAY THAT CRADUM IS SAFE FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY NOT NOW IS IT SAFER THAN THE OTHER OPIOIS AND IF SO WHY WILL IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT LET'S TAKE A SHORT GLANCE AT THE PHARMOCOLOGY OF CRADUM AND HOW IT WORKS IN TERMS OF ITS NOR CHEMISTRY IN THE BODY NOW ON TO KEEP THIS PRETTY BRIEF BECAUSE IN THE FUTURE I'M GOING TO DO AN EXTENDED EPISODE ALL ABOUT OPOIDS AND I WILL INCLUDE CRADEM IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT JUST TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT AND DISCUSS WHAT OPIOIDS ARE OPIOIDS ARE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN ACTIVATE THE SO CALLED INDOGENEOUS OPIOID SYSTEM ALL OF US HAVE WITHIN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THE CAPACITY TO RELEASE OUR OWN OPIOIDS THAT'S RIGHT YOU HAVE OPIOIDS WITHIN YOUR BODY THEY ARE RELEASED FROM NURONS AND THEY BIND TO SO CALLED OPIOID RECEPTORS PERHAPS SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD THE SO CALLED RUNNERS HIGH THE RUNNERS HIGH IS A EUPHORIC STATE IT'S A FAIRLY MILD EUPHORIC STATE IN MOST CASES BUT IT'S EUPHORIC STATE INDUCED BY LONG DURATION EFFORT A KA E THE RUNNERS HIGH THE RUNNERS HIGH IS JUST A PHRASE USED TO EXPLAIN THAT WHEN WE ENGAGE IN LONG DURATION RAPETITIVE ACTION EFFORT THE BODY STARTS RELEASING THESE INDOGENEOUS OPIOIDS THEY BIND TO RECEPTORS AND THEY TRIGGER THINGS LIKE ANALGESA RELIEF FROM PAIN THEY TRIGGER MILD EUPHORIA THEY TEND TO CHANGE OUR PERCEPTION OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD MAKE THINGS LOOK MORE BEAUTIFUL CHINE THEY GIVE THINGS A LITTLE BIT OF ACHINE WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS A MILD VERSION OF WHAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY TAKE SOMETHING LIKE MORPHINE WHEN PEOPLE TAKE MORPHINE THERE'S A MORE OF A SEDITIVE EFFECT THERE'S MORE OF A EUPHORIC EFFECT AND THERE'S MORE OF A DREAM LIKE EFFECT AND AGAIN IT WILL DEPEND ON DO SUCH CRADUM AND MORPHINE AND HYDROCODON ALL HAVE THE PROPERTY OF ACTING LIKE THE INDOGENOUS OPIOIDS BUT AT MUCH HIGHER POTENCY WHEN YOU BRING THEM INTO YOUR SYSTEM THEY CROSS THE BLOBANE BARRIER SO THEY GO INTO THE BRAIN AND THEY BIND TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPIOID RECEPTORS THERE'S THE MEW OPIOID RECEPTOR BY THE WAY THESE NAMES ALL FOLLOW GREEK ALPHABET LETTERS SO THE MEW OPIOID RECEPTOR THE CAPA OPIOID RECEPTOR THEIR BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ONES CRADEM BINDS PREFERENTIALLY TO THE MEW OPIOID RECEPTOR AND SOMEWHAT TO THE CAPA OPIOID RECEPTOR THERE'S A BIGMESS CONCEPTION OUT THEIR LOT OF PEOPLE SPECIALLY PEOPLE WERE PROPONENTS OF CRADUM WILL SAY NO MORPHINE AND HYDROCODUM BIND THE MEW OPIOID RECEPTOR WHERE AS CRADTEM BINDS THE CAPOPIOID RECEPTOR SO IT'S A DIFFERENT COMPOUND VERY VERY DIFFERENT NOT TRUE NOT TRUE CRADEM MORPHINE AND HYDROCOTON ALL BIND TO THE MU OPIOID RECEPTER AND THAT'S WHAT'S LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR IT'S OPIOID LIKE EFFECTS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET THE DOSAGE UP TO A LEVEL WHERE YOU START GETTING THE MILD CEDATION THE ANALGESA THE PAIN RELIEF AND KEEP IN MIND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TAKING CRADEM BECAUSE THEY WANT PAIN RELIEF AND WHEN THAT MEU OPIOID RECEPTOR SYSTEM IS ACTIVATED IT INDIRECTLY ACTIVATES A LOT OF THE REINFORCEMENT CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN THAT RELATES TO DOPOMING AND CEROTONENT THIS IS ANOTHER AREA THAT WILL GO INTO IN MORE DEPT THAN THE FUTURE BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY PEOPLE SAY OH YOU KNOW CRADEM DOESN'T TRIGGER THE DOPOMING SYSTEM THEREFOR IT'S NOT ADDICTIVE BUT THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE IT INDIRECTLY ACTIVATES THE REINFORCEMENT CIRCUITRY THAT INCLUDES BOTH DOPEMING AND CERATONAN BUT IT'S PRIMARY EFFECT IS TO HIT THIS MEU OPIOID RECEPTOR SYSTEM THAT EXISTS IN A BUNCH OF PLACES IN THE BRAIN BUT MAINLY IN THE BRAINSTEM AND STRUCTURE CALL THE PERIAQUIDUCTAL GRAY NUCLEUS WHICH THEN PROVIDES PAIN RELIEF IT TRIGGERS A NUMBER OF DIFFE SHIFTSIN COGNITION IT'S WHAT CREATES THAT MILD EUFORIA ET CETERA ET CETERA NOW HOW CAN WE BE SO CONFIDENT THAT CRATEM IS ACTING SO SIMILARLY TO HYDROCODONE AND TO MORPHINE I'LL BE IT WITH LOWER POTENCY AND THE REASON IS IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE A DRUG THAT BLOCKS THE MU OPIOID RECEPTOR PRIOR TO THEM TAKING CRATEM THEY DON'T EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE CLASSIC EFFECTS OF TAKING CRADEM NOW UPORIA NOANALGESIA NO CEDATION A EVEN AT THE LODOSAGE IS NO MILD STIMULANT OF FACT SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT CRATEM AS AN OPIOID THAT'S JUST THE HONEST TRUTH AND IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T LIKE THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE YOU LIKE CRADEM I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT YOU DON'T LIKE CRADEM ON TELLING YOU YOU LIKELY LIKE CRATUM BECAUSE IT'S AN OPIOID SO AGAIN IF YOU GO ON LINE IN YOU START ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT CRADEM AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THESE TWO CAMPS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE CRATEM IS TERRIBLE IT'S ADDICT IVE IT'S EVERYTHING BAD CAMP AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE OTHER CAMP OUT THERE VERY VOCAL IS WELL TALKING ABOUT HOW CRATUM HELPED THEM AVOID OTHER THINGS THAT ARE WORSE AND YOUKNOW THIS IS AN ARGUMENT THAT FRANKLY I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO LEAN ON RIGHT THE IDEA THAT SUBSTANCE A IS NOT AS BAD AS SUBSTANCE B AND THAT MAKING SUBSTANCE A UNAVAILABLE IS JUST GOING TO SEND EVERYONE RUNNING FOR SUBSTANCE B YOU KNOW THAT'S A WEAK ARGUMENT FRANKLY RIGHT I HEARD THIS ARGUMENT AROUND CANABAS AND BY THE WAY I I THINK PRETTY BALANCED ABOUT CANABAS IF YOU LISTEN TO THE EPISODE I DID ON CANABAS I THINK YOU'LL AGREE THAT I BELIEVE THAT CANABAS HAS ITS THE REPUTIC APPLICATIONS I ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY YOUNG MAILS WITH A PREDISPOSITION TO PCYCHOSIS SHOULD NOT BE TAKING HIGH CONCENTRATION T H C CANABAS BECAUSE THE DAT A TELL US THEY ARE ALREADY AT RISK OF PCSYCHOSIS AND THEY ARE A MUCH GREATER RISK OF PSYCHOSIS IF THEY DO SO I THINK I'M PRETTY BALANCED ABOUT THE STORY ON CANABAS BUT I OFTEN HEAR THE ARGUMENT O CANABAS ISN'T AS BAD AS ALCOHOL AND THEREFORE CANABAS IS GOOD THAT'S SIMPLY NOT RATIONAL WHAT WE SHOULD BE SAYING IS WHETHER NOT ITS CANABAS OR ALCHOL OR CRATUM OR ANY SUBSTANCE FOR THAT MATTER WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND AGAIN THIS IS FAR TOO MUCH THAN WE CAN GO INTO IN THIS A M A AND WE WILL GO INTO IN A FUTURE FULL LENGTH EPISODE O THE HURMEN LADPODCAST BUT THE OTHER THING TO REALLY KEEP IN MIND IS THE LACK OF REGULATION OVER CRATUM SUPPLEMENTS NOW AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I AM A FAND OF MANY NOT ALL BUT MANY SUPPLEMENTS IN CERTAIN  CONDITIONS ID ALWAYS SAY BEHAVIORS FIRST THAN NUTRITION THEND IF AND ONLY IF IT'S NEEDED RELY ON SUPPLEMENTATION BUT SUPPLEMENTATION IS A BIG CATEGORY BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE OPIOID COMPOUNDS I START TO GET NERVOUS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH ABUSE POTENTIAL AND THE HIGH A DICTION POTENTIAL OF OPUOITS AND CRATUM IS INCLUDED IN THAT CATEGORY A COUPLE OF OTHER KEY NOTES ABOUT CRATUM WEL LE DEATH DIRECTLY FROM CRATUM IS FAIRLY RARE IT HAS HAPPENED NOW HYDROCODONE AND MORPHINE SUPPRESS RESPIRATION AS SHE SUPPRESS BREATHING BY WAY OF A MECHANISM THAT IF YOU ARE LISTENER THE HUBRUMLAPODCAST YOU KNOW ABOUT WHICH IS THE SO CALLED PHYSIOLOGICAL SIE MANY OF YOU FORD ME TALK ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE SOMETHING THAT YOU DO VOLUNTARILY THE DOUBLE IN HELL THROUGH THE NOSE AND THEN ALONG EXHAL IN ORDER TO RAPIDLY REDUCE YOUR LEVEL OF STRESS FAR AS WE KNOW THATS THE FASTEST WAY TO DELIBERATELY LOWER YOUR LEVEL OF STRESS BUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AS A SPONTANEOUS PATTERN OF BREATHING THAT OCCURS INVOLUNTARILY IN SLEEP IN ORDER TO REINFLATE THE LUNGS AND ALLFLOAD CARBONDIOXIDE AND BRING OXYGEN BACK INTO THE SYSTEM ON THE SUBSEQUENT BREATH WHEN I INTERVIEW DOCTOR JACK FELDMAN WHO IS A PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSY CALFORNIA LOS ANGELIS AND REALLY THE PIONEER OF THE MODERN NURR SCIENCE UNDERSTANDING OF RESPIRATION HE TALKED ABOUT SOME STUDIES IN HIS LABORATORY THAT WERE EXPLORING WHY PEOPLE DIE WHEN TAKING OPIOITS THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE ASSOCIATE WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS AND WHAT HE MENTIONED WAS THAT THE OPIOIDS BINED TO PARTICULAR RECEPTORS IN THE BRAINSTEM LOCATIONS THAT GENERATE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE SO OPIOIDS WHEN TAKEN AS DRUGS SUPPRESS PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGING AND DO SO DURING SLEEP AND LACK OF ADEQUATE RESPIRATION MEANING PEOPLE STOP BREATHING DURING SLEEP IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY PEOPLE DIE WHEN THEY TAKE OPIOIS NOW CRATEM IS NOT KNOWN TO SUPPRESS RESPIRATION WHEN TAKEN AT LOW TO MODERATE DOSAGES BUT WHEN COMBINED WITH ANY OTHER OPIOIDS AND CERTAINLY WHEN COMBINED WITH ALCOHOL IT CAN SUPPRES RESPIRATION AND WHILE THE DATE ON THIS ARE FAIRLY SCANT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT CRATUM INDUCED DEATH IS CAUSED BY SUPPRESSION OF THE RESPIRATION SYSTEM SO AGAIND DEATH DUE TO TAKING CRATEM AT THE DOSAGES THAT R RECOMMENDED ON MOST COMMERCIAL PACKAGING IS FAIRLY RARE ALTHOUGH IT HAS HAPPENED ITS UN CLEAR IF IT HAPPEN BECAUSE IT WAS TAKEN IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT SEEMS LIKELY BUT WE CAN'T FORGET THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TAKING CRATUM AT MUCH HIGHER DOSAGES AND IN FACT PROGRESSIVELY HIGHER AND HIGHER DOSAGES FROM THESE OVER THE COUNTER SOURCES AND WITH INCREASED DOSAGE THERE IS YES AND INCREASE RISK OF RESPIRATORY FAILURE SO AGAIN ALL THIS POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CRADUM IS SIMPLY NOT A BENIGN SUBSTANCE SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY HONEST THE ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL OF CRATEUM IS REAL IT IS EXASCERBATED FOR SOME PEOPLE COMPARE TO OTHERS BUT IT IS REAL IT'S VERY SIMILARITIES TO OTHER MORE POTENT FORMS OF OPIOIDS ARE WHAT MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO COME OFF THOSE MORE POTENT FORM OF OPIOIDS BUT THE GOAL OF COURSE IS TO COMPLETELY COME OFF ALL OPIOIDS AND CRATEM ITSELF CAN BE A BIT OF A TRAP IT CAN BE A TRAP IN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER TAKEN OTHER OPIOIDS CAN BECOME ADDICTED TO CRATEM ITSELF THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT CAN HAPPEN IT HAS HAPPEN IN A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT CRATEM CAN POTENTIALLY BE A TRAP KNOSISAID POTENTIALLY BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO COME OFF OTHER MORE POTENT FORMS OF OPIOIDS AND THEN THEY USE CRATEUM TO DO THAT AND THEN THE'RE RATCHONING UP THEY'RE DOSAGE OF CRATUM SUCH THAT THEY'RE NOW MATCHING THE INDOGINOUS RESPONSE TO CRATUM IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T REALLY DISTINGUISH FROM THE EFFECTS THAT THEY WERE GETTING FROM MORPHINE AND HYDROKODON WELL THEN THEY'RE JUST USING A DIFFERENT FORM OF MORPHINE AND HYDROKODONE AND I'M SURE THAT SOME OF YOU ARE OUT THEIRE SAYING THAT IS RIDICULOUS YOU CANNOT COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF CRATEM TO THE EFFECTS OF HYDROKODUN BUT THE POTENCY IS ABOUT ONE SIXTH OF HYDROKODON AND THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE JUST INCREASING AND INCREASING BOTH THE DOSAGE AND MODIFYING THE TYPE OF CRATUM THAT THEY'ARE TAKING SO THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE CRATUM THAT HAS A PARTICULAR THE HIGH CONCENTRATION OF ONE OF THE ALKALOIDS THAT HITS THAT MEU OPIOID RECEPTER HARDEST AND IN DOING SO SURE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE PURE HYDROCODON EFFECT BUT THEY'RE ETTING REALLY CLOSE SO MY ADVICE WOULD BE IF YOU HAVEN'T TOUCH CRATUM DON'T TOUCH IT AT ALL EVER IF YOU ARE TAKING CRATUM YOU NEED TO TAKE NOTE OF WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED THANK YOU OR JOINING FOR THE BEGINNING OF THIS ASK ME ANYTHING EPISODE TO HEAR THE FULL EPISODE AND TO HEAR FUTURE EPISODES OF THESE ASK ME ANYTHING SESSIONS PLUS

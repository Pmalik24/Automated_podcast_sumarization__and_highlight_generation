WELL YOUVE FERD THE WORDS DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION OVER AND OVER AND OVER D E I A HURIT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE YOU HUREITE FROM YOUR CORPORATION YOU HURE IT FROM THE MEDIA AND THIS STANDARD DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION ACCORDING TO JOBION'S WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN INFUSE IN EVERY ASPECT OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT NOW WHAT EXACTLY DOES ANY OF THAT MEAN WE TALKED ABOUT IT AT LENGTH ON THE SHOW BEFORE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION IS ESSENTIALLY CRITICAL RACE THEORY BOILED DOWN TO A FRIENDLIER PIECE OF CORPORATE BOILER PLATE ESSENTIALLY WOOD ARGUES IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION IN WHICH ONE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP IS UNDERREPRESENTED IN ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR JOB THAT MUST B THE RESULT OF SOME SORT OF SYSTHEMIC DISCRIMINATION OR RACISM SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SAY BLACK SURGEONS THAT IS BECAUSE THE SURGICAL SYSTEM ITSELF DISCRIMINATES AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE IN THE SOR OF VISION OF IBRAM EXCENDY EITHER EVERY ONE IS EQUAL IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY WHICH MEANS THAT THEREFORE EVERYONESHULD BE EQUALLY REPRESENTED IN EVERY INDUSTRY OR EVERY ONE IS UNEQUAL WHICH MEANS THAT YOU ARE RACIS NOW THERE IS A A SORT OF HALF WAYED POINT BETWEEN THOSE TWO POSITIONS WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE TRUTH THAT PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND ALL INDIVIDUALITY DIFFER IN THEIR GENETICS THEY DIFFER IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS THEY DIFFER IN THEIR CULTURE THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE DIFFERENT IN THAT MEANS THT WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT GROUP BAVERAGEIS THERE ARE VERY FEW EXAMPLES ACTUALLY A CROSS ALL OF HUMANITY IN WHICH GROUP AVERAGES ARE COMPLETELY IDENTICAL BUT WE HAVE TO IGNORE THAT IN FAVOR OF THIS D E IPROPOSITION WHY BECAUSE D E I IS A IS A GUN POINTED DIRECTLY AT THE HEART OF THE MARYTOCRACY THE MARYTOCRACY SUGGESTS THAT THERE SHOULD BE OBJECTIVE METRICS BY WHICH WE SUCCEED OR FAIL AND THE GOOD NEWSABOUT MARYTOCRACY IS THAT IT MEANS THAT IF YOU SUCCEED IT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING BETTER THAN SOMEONE ELSE WHICH MEANS THAT'S BETTER FOR EVERY ONE ELSE THE D E I IDEA INNATELY MEANS THAT PEOPLE WH ARE UNQUALIFIED ARE GOING TO ADVANCE IN LIFE BY DINTS OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERED A PART OF THE VICTIMIZED TO GROUP NOW WHY DOES THIS MATTER IN MATTERS IN PRTY MUCH EVERY INDUSTRY MATTERS TAT UNIVERSITIES WHERE YOU'V SEEN FOR EXAMPLE AGIAN AMERICANS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO HIGH ACHIEVING IN FAVOR AF PEOPLE FROM OTHER GROUPS WHO HAVE LOWER TESCORES YOU'VE SEEN IT IN THE GOVERNMENT RECEIVE POPLE COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED FOR PARTICULAR OFFICES APPOINTED TWO THOSE OFFICES SO AS TO ESTABLISH SOMEFORM OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND NOW WE SEE IT IN MEDICINE SO ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS EXCELLENT RESEARCH FROM PRODUCER GREGRAY HE HELPS US PUT THIS TOGETHER AND IT'S IN AMAZING AMAZING STORY D I IS NOT JUST PRESENT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR CORPORATE HIRING PRACTICES IT IS ALSO PRESENT IN MEDICINE AND THAT SHOULD FRIGHT ON LIVING HELL OUT OF EVERYONE BECAUSE ALL YOU CAREABOUT WHEN YOU GOIN TO THE DOCRIES IS MY DOCTOR GOOD AT THE MEDICINING IS MY DOCTOR GOOD AT TAKING CARE OF ME AND MAKING SURE THAT I AM HEALTHY AND IN THIS IS AN ARYA WHERE MARYTOCRACY SHOULD BE THE ONLY THING THAT COUNTS IS MY DOCTOR LIKELY TO FIX ME OR IS MY DOCTOR BAD AT THAT JOB AND GOT APPOINTED BECAUSE OF EXTRANEOUS MERITS AND WHEN MATTER WHAT THOSE EXTRAMEOUS MERITS ARE WHETHER THEY ARE INTERSECTIONAL OR WHETHER IT'S NAPIT THAT DOESN'T MATTER ALL YOU CARE ABOUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THAT SURGICAL BED IS THAT THE PERSAN OPERATING ON YOU SHOULD BE GOOD AT THAT JOB BUT SURGERY IS NOW BEING IMPACTED BY D E EYE APPARENTLY SORCE IS AT WAKE FORSE MDICAL SCHOOL ARE ABOUT TO GRATUATE CISHELL DILL ROSARIO SHE'S A MED STUDENT WHO INJURED A CONCERMATIVE PATIENT AND THEN BRAGGED ABOUT IT HERE IS WHAT SHE TWEATED HIS A BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO QUOTE I HAD A PATIENT I WAS DOING A BLOOD DRAWON SEE MY PRONOUN PIN AND LAUGH LOUDLY TO THE STAFF SHE HER WELL OF COURSE IT IS WHAT OTHER PRONOUNS ARE EVEN ARE THERE IT I MISS TIS VAIN SO HO HAD TO GET STUCK TWICE SNORTING LAUGHING EMOGI NOW THAT OF COURSE IS IN INSAIN TWE THE IDEA BEING THAT IF SOMEBODY DISAGREES IF YOU POLITICALLY THEN YOU MAKE THEM ACTUALLY SUFFER BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THE POSITION OF THE DOCTOR NOW AS OUR S SOURCEIS TELL US WAKE FOREST ALOUD ROSARIA T LAYLOW AND TAKE A VOLUNTARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE WHEN THIS SCANDAL ORIGINALLY BROKE A  SHE WAS NOT ACTUALLY EXPELLED OR SUSPENDED AND I FACT NO APOLOGY WAS ISSUED WAKE FOREST WENT INTO FULL DENIAL MODE OVER ALL THIS ALSO YOU PEN HEALTH HAS HIRED YOU WIN LU WHOS DELROSARIO'S CLASSMATE WHO ALSO TWEATED THAT IT SEEMED QUOTE CARMATIC WHEN SHE INJURED THE PATIENT WHO MOCKED HER PRONOUN PIN WAKE FOREST THAN SHOUTED LOOU WITH THE WORDS FOR EXCELLENCE AND PATIENT CARE SHE NOW FOLKS IS ON EL G B T KU PLUS HELTH HERE'S WHAT SHE TEATED AT THE TIME QUOTE HERD THIS STORY FIRST TEN WEEKS AGO AND IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE ARE MIS INTERPRETING UNDERSTANDABLY FROM THE PHRASING TO CLARIFY THE MIS STICK WAS COMPLETELY IN ACCIDENT AND JUST SEEMED QUOTEN QUOT CARMATIC SHE'S KIND AN PROFESSIONAL AND WOULD NEVER HARM ANY ONE INTENTIONALLY E GAS MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE MOMENT FIRST I'V BEEN TONG I MA HELIC SLEEP MATTRESS FOR YEARS I'VE HAD THAT HELIKSLEY MATTRESS FOR

IT'STHER BEST OFFER YET IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST LONG WITH HELITS BETTER SLEEP STARTS RIGHT NOW SO FIRST OF ALL THE BASIC IDEA THE MEDICAL ERROR IS ROOTED IN CARMA THAT YOU QUON'T UO DESURV IT IF THERE'S A MEDICAL  ERROR UPON YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE WRONG BELIEF SYSTEM LIKE SAY YOU BELIEVE IN THE ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC FACT TO THERE ARE MEN AND THERE ARE WOMEN THAT IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS PROBLEM ALSO ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES BOTH YOU PEN AND LOSE MEDICAL SCHOOLWAY FORUST IF ATTEMPTED TO HIDE LOOSE HIRING WHE FORSE DIDNECTIOLD LIST LOSE HOSPITAL AND GRADUATION MATERIALS PENS IS NOT LIST LOSE MEDICAL SCHOOL ON ITS WEB SIDE NOW AGAIN ALL THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBER AND THIS ONE BASIC SITUATION WHICH NO APOLOGY WAS ISSUED FOR A BAD TWEAT YOU COULD THEORETICALLY IMAGINE A SITUATION IN WHICH THESE STUDENTS THEY SAID SOMETHING DUMB BUT NOW THEY APOLOGIZE FOR IT BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THATIT WAS WRONG TO SAY IT BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENE AND THE BIGGER PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT THIS SORT OF PERSPECTIVE WHICH THAT LEFT WING SOCIAL VIEWS OR INTROSECTONAL QUOLITIES MAKE YOU A BETTER DOCTOR THIS IS BECOME A WIDESPREAD PERSPECTIVE IN THE FIELD OF SURGERY SO LET'S TALK ABOUT IN WARDWINING DUE SURGICAORESSENT IN VIGNASH RAMAN AN INTERNAL D ILECTUR RAMAN ACTUALLY SAID THAT IUS HART SINKS WHEN HE HAVE PATIENTS W WATCH FOX NEWS OR WHERE MAGAHATS HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY YOU KNON THING AS WE IN THE THOU RIGHT AND UNLIKE A LOT OF THE ELECT HOSPITALS IN THE NOTHES ON THE WES WE SAR A VERY SOUTHERN POPULATION THIS IS NOT OF I P HOSPITAL A PEOPLE ARE NOT LIKE FLYING IN FROM CATA TO GET TREATED HER WE TREAT PATIENTS WA JUS FROM THE COMMUNITY IN THE SOUTH AND YES MY HOT TINGS EVERYTIME I GOING TO A ROOM AND I WATCH THEM WATCHING FOXUS ARE THEY HAVE AMAGA HAT ON ARE THEY'RE WEARING A CONFEDERATE BET AND I THESE ARE THE PATIENTS OT RETREAT BUT DORDA I A WOLT SAYO THE ONE VERY GOOD THING ABO THER THOUGHT THAT INJON IS EXACTLY WHAT A LEDED TO ALIA IS THAT WE DON'T TREAT THE IPES WE TREAT PEOPLE FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND ALL COMMUNITY IS AS ALW EXPLAIN IS MAJORITY NON WHITE AND IT IS WONDERFUL TO TREAT SUCH A DIVES GROUP OF PEOPLE IN EVERY REGOD AND THAT'S NOT AN EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD AN MY SAVIS ANOTHER PLACEAS A AUGHT THAT MY FRIENDS HAVE TRAINING ANOTHER PROGRESSS FORS WALL DIVERSE MEANING NON WHITE IS AN AMAZINGLY EUPHAMISTIC STATEMENTDIVERS USUALLY MEANS YOU KNOW I BROUGHT DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE BUT NOW OF COURSE DIVERSITY MEANS NOT WHITE PEOPLE SO FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU HAVE SURGICAL RESIDENT IT ONE WORDS TALKING ABOUT THEIR HEARTS SINKING WHEN THEY SEE SOMEBODY OF A DIFFERENT POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT SHOULD PUT UP YOUR RADE ARE A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S NOT THE BAD PART THE BAD PART IS WHAT RAMAN SAYS NEXT SO ACCORDING TO RAMAN HE SAYS THE POST GEORGE FLOID DUKE ACTUALLY MADE A CONSERTED EFFORTS TO STOP HIRING SO MANY CONCAL WALLS OF WHITE MEN AND THAT THE TEAM EVEN LEARNED TO ABANDIN PARTICULAR METRICS ANDS OP POLISTIC APPLICATION PRACTICES SO AS TO ACCROUP MORE WOMEN AND MORE LATIN ACT SURGEONS HERE'S VIGNASH RAMAN TWENTY TWENTY EN DOFLIE TOS EVEN HAEN AND GO COLLECTIVLY YAGENAS THE CONYEES OF DUCUETEA TETEY AE AMEN TO TRY TO DOTHO TE AND RECOGNIZE THEN IS LIKE SENTIURIS LONG HISSO RASISM AND FLAVORY IN WHICH DUPUNIVESITY ESENTIALLY WAS FONDED ON WHICH OF A FONDED AND THAT'S WHEN WE THOUGHT OF AD TO CONFRONT THAT THE HISTY OF INSTITUTION THEY SF OU DEPARTMEN THE THAT THEM THAT THE WA THE WHITE MEN THAT A DRAKED ACROSS O A ALWAYS AAND AND AND THAT'S WHEN WE WESATITIS STOE THINK THAT MAY BE SOMETHING SHOULD CHANGE SOMETHING TERCHANGE WITHIN OURS O AND IN  AND WHO COMPRISES THIS DEPARTMENT THEND OF THE FACULTY INSTEND OF RESIDEN SIGNIFICANT INEQUITY IN REPRESENTATION IN OUR PROGRAMM AND AND SOMETHING THAT WEIN CONSCIOUSLY DELIBERATELY WORKING HAD TO CHANGE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEAS IM SOME OF THINGS THAT WE THAT WE HAVE DONE IN ADDITION TO WHAT LILIN PRESENTED I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE WEVE DON IS REALLY SYSTEMAC CHANGES TO OUR RECRUITEMENT PROCESS  TO TRY TO PRECRUIT DIVERS RESIDENCE TO UR PROGRAMM AND THEN TO RETAIN IN SEPOLTTES I ES RESIDENCE OFF TO THE GET TO OUR PROGRAME SO PART OF THIS HAS IN BAL TRONTES THING TO COMPLETETHE HOLISTIC REVIEW PROCESS THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT OT TO DAY IM APONDIDING IN  ALL TO METRIKS ANC CREENS IM LOOKING AT PEOPLES BLIFE STORY IN IN WHAT PRO THEM INTO SURY IM AND THEN THE OTHEPART OFIT IS IN ETING THAT I BIST PEOPLE READ THE OPPLICATIONS AND BECAUSE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OFTINSURING THAT WE GET THATTIS RESIDENCE INTO OUR PROGRAMM AND THEN ONCE RESIDENCE GET HERE I HOW DO WE HOWTRE SUPPORT THEM SOJUST TO GET THAT STRAIT HE'S LITERALLY SAYING THAT WE ARE IGNORING METRICS IN ORDER TO LOOK AT THE LIFE STORY OF YOUR SURGEON NOW JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU GO IN FOR AN OPEN HARD SURGERY HAS GOD FROM MEDGOT A BLOCKAGE IN YOUR ARNERY DO YOU ASK FOR THE SURGEON'S LIFE STORY DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE SURGEONS LIFE STORY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT THE SURGEONS LIFE STORY OR DO YOU CARE A LOT MORE ABOUT WHETHER THIS DOCTOR HAS A GOOD TRAC RECORD OF MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE WHO REQUIRE A BYE PASS ACTUALLY GET THE BY PAST THEY NEED WITHOUT DYING ON THE TABLE IT IS INSANE FOR SURGICAL RESIDENCIES DO TAKE A LOOK AT PEOPLE BASE ON THEIR WHIFE STORY AS OPPOSED TO OBJECTIC MACTRIC OF SUCCESS IT'S TOTALLY CRAZY IT'S TOTALLY WHAT BY THE WAY THIS SAME PERSON HAS ALSO TWEATED THAT HE WON'T QUOT QUOTE AMPLIFY MEDICAL LITERATURE INVOLVING ONLY WHITE MEN HE TWEATED OUT IS JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY QUOTE I WOULD SAY EVEN FOR ACADEMICE PUBLICATIONS I DON'T WANT TO AMPLIFY THE WORK OF WHITE MEN WHO ONLY COLLABORATE WITH OTHER WHITE MEN WE HATE O MOST OF THE MODERN MEDICAL ADVANCES IN HUMAN HISTORY IN E SURIOUSLY YOU YOU YOUARE NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY TAKE A BOOK AT THE ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS OF WHITE MAN WORKING WITH OTHER WHITE MEN LE FIRST OF ALL THITS RACISM SECOND OF ALL THESE ARE THE AREAS WHERE MERIT MATTERS MOST AND OF COURSE AGAIN EVEN THE SKUY IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF A BIG OR TREN DISGUISE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS THE ACE YES GAVE ITS EIGHTIEIGHT THOUSAND MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE A DEFINITION OF RACISM THAT SAYS IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE DERACES AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID QUOTE RACM RACISM IS THE MARGINALIZATION AND ORE OPPRESSION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR THASE ON A SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED RACIAL HIERARCHY THAT PRIVILEGES WHITE PEOPLE RACISM INVOLVES ONE GROUP HAVING THE POWER TO CARRY OUT SYSTEMATIC DISCRIMINATION THROUGH THE INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF SOCIETY AND BY SHAPING THE CULTURAL BELIEFS AND VALUES THAT SUPPORT THOSE RACES POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT IS THE IPRAM EXCENDY DEFINITION OF RACISM RACISM IS NOT JUST DISCRIMINATION AGAINST A RACE IT IS POWER PLUS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE RACE AND THE ONLY PEOPLE WE CAN EVER DEEM TO BE POWERFUL ARE WHITE MEN WHICH MEANS THAT BEING RACIST AGAINST O WHITE PEOPLE IS TOTALLY VINE NOT ONLY IS AT FIND IT IS A CORRECTIVE MECHANISM SO BARRING FOR EXAMPLE WHITE MEN FROM GETTING INTO TOP LEVEL SURGICAL RESIDENCES AS A CORRECTIVE MECHANISM IS SOMEHOW GOOD NOW AND YOU PUT THAT PRESSURE ALL THE WAY DOWN SYSTEM AND WHAT YOU'RE ENDING UP WITH IS FEU ARE QUALIFIED PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTERING THE SYSTEM AND MORE UNQUALIFIED PEOPLE GOING TO TOP MEDICAL SCHOOLS IT'S MORE ONTHIS IN JUST ONE MOMENT FIRST CAN YOU

TALKING NONSENSICAL PHRASEOLOGIES ALL THE STUFF IS ONE THING IN THES SUNORGISTIC CORPORAT BOARD ROOM IT IS ANOTHER THING WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SORDUCAL ROO HERE'S A RESON CONFERENTE ONT I AT PEN WHERE YOU AND WUNA WORK ONE SURGEON EXPLAIN THAT WASE OFF PUTTING THAT SO MANY SURGEONTS WERE QUONCAL WHITE MEN YOU KNOW IT'S I THINK SURGEAN GENERAL HAS BEEN YOU KNOW A PREDOMINENTLY WHITE AN MA DOMINATED FELD AND THAT CAN BE VERY AM OF CUTTING AND INTIMIDATE ANGOR SOMEBODY A AND I YOU KNOW UNFORTION I THINK THEY PROBABLY LOST YOU KNOW MANY GRIDAT MINDS JUST FOR THAT READEN THE DON'T FEE I THEY THE LAN THEY FEEL LIKE THERE ANOTHER AND I THINK YOU DON'T LEC TUR HEAR IT IT YOU CAN VERY EASILY FEEL LIKE ANOTHER JUST BECAUSE YE DON'T LOOK LIKE THER SHAR ALOT OF THE SAME EXPERENCES AS YOUR PEERS YYOU KNOW IT MAKE SOMEBODY FEEL LIKE ANOTHER IF YOU LITERALLY SAY THAT THEY ARE IN OPPRESSOR CLASS AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE PART OF YOUR SURGICAL RESIDENCY THESE SEAME DOCTOR IS GO ON TO EXPLAIN THE SURGER REQUIRE SOMETHING LIKE THE ANIFELLS RUNY RULES THE RUNY RULE IS A RUIN THE ANIFELL THA YOU MUST INTERVIEW A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BLACK C APPLICANTS TO A POSITION TBEFORE YOU ARE ACTUALLY ALLOWED TO HIRE SO THEIR SAYING THE TEAMS SHOULD BE FORCED INTERVIEU MIGH NORTY CANDIDATES REGARDLES OF QUALIFICATIONS I PUBLISHED YEARS AGO THAT THE RUNY RULE THE RULE THEY US THAT HAD A FELLS SHOULD BE APPLIE TO I CAN AVE IT BOT A TAT A I CAN AV SURGER IN PARSICULAAR AM IF YOU THOUGHTSOME OF THE COMMENTS MUST RECIVLY ABOUT THE I EFFORTS WERE AR CHOLENGIN IT AN INFLAMEN TORA NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE A DECAT A GO THAT MEANS THAT IS STILL NEEDED TO BE DISCUSSED SO I THINK THE LANDS OF WHO ELSE IS OUT THERE LET'S REACH A LITTLE FURTHER NOT DOWN BUT OT AM PERTAIN TO CANTINANCE THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER IT IS POBLAR THE WAY THAT THAT THEY NEEDS TO GO SAMFORD MY BEON I THEE THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE SOME A A COUNTABILITY OR SOME AM YOU DON'T CREDENTS PUT ON DIVERSITY INISIATIVES PUT ON THET DIVERSITY WORK THAT YOU MAR MAY NOT BE DOING HER THE DIVERSITY OF YOUR DEPARTMENT FOR THE DIVERSITY OF SOMETHING BECAUSE CERTAINLY IF YOU PUBLISHD SEVENTY FIVE MANUSCRIPTS IN AN ABREVIATED MOUNT OF TIME ABSOLUTELY BUT THE RUNY RULE WHICH WE KNOW DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL SINCE THERE'S NOT THAT MANY BLACK YOU KNOW A HAD COACHES IS ALSO THAT THEY THEY UST HAVE TO INTERVIEW THEM THEY DON'T HAVE A HIRER WOOMAN THEY NOHAE TO ACTUALLY THINK OF BOUT THEN YOU DON' ON THE SAME LEVEL THEY HAVE TO INTERVIEW THEM IT'SO I THINK THAT STILL WERE STILL IN THE SAME ISSUE THAT IF THE WHITE MAN OR OR YOU KNOW THA THE WHITE MAIL CHAIR IS PICKING THEIR SUCCESSOR OR PICKING WHOEVER IT IS THERE'S STILL BEEN A GRAVITY TOWARDS THE WHITE MAIL WHATEVER AND SO THE RULY  I THING IS GREAT THAT IT NEEDS TO GO ONCE THAT FURTHER AND AND I'M SURE AT THAT LECNATI CREDITLY ARR OUT IN THE WORLD BUT WHAT IT'S TRUE IF WHE KNOW JUST INTERVIEWIN AITAN ENOUGH CO THIS DONE I AINT IT SO PEOPLE MUST BE FORCED TO SELECT FORCE TO SELECT BLACK CANDIDATES OR MINORITY CANDIDATES OR WHOMEVER FORCE TO PICK TAT I LOVE THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW LIVING THIS ORWELLIAN WORLD WHERE SHE CAN ASSUME THAT IF A WHITE CHAIR OF A MEDICAL ASSOCIATION PICKS SAY IN ASIAN PERSONS TOR A PLACE THEM THAT THAT IS IN A FACT WHITE SUPREMACY DONE THROUGH UNCONSCIOUS BICE BUT IF THEY OPENLY PICK SOMEBODY FOR RACE THEN THAT IS SOMEHOW A CORRECTIVE ANOTHER WOULD YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS EVIL IN ORDER FOR YOU TO PURPET PERPETUATE YOUR OWN EVIL WHICH IS TO SELECT PEOPLE NOT ON THE BASIS OF MERIT THAT YOU LITERALLY SAYS THAT IT'S ONE THING IF YOU HAVE SEVENTY FIVE PUBLICATION OR WAT EVER BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPL WHO DON'T HAVE SEVENTY FIVE POUP WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST IN COMPETENT WHY SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE A SHOT THAT BEING CHIEF MEDICAL RESIDENT AT HARVARD WHY NOT WHAT WHAT WOULD EXACTLY IS TE PROBLEM WHELL I MEAN LISTEN HERE'S THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE THORD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES IS MEDICAL ERROR THAT'S THE THORD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH THEY'RE ENOUGH MISTAKES THAT GET MADE IN THE OPERATING ROOM OR IN DOCTOR'S OFFICES ALL AROUND THE CONTRY ALREADY THE LAST THING THAT YOU NEED IS TO SPECIFICALLY GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO PUT UNQUALIFIED PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER BASED ON THEIR RACE AND WHENEVER PEOPLE SAY THE SORT OF STUFF THERE'S AN ACCUSATION WHAT YOUR SAYING IS RACES KNO WHAT I AM SAYING IS THE OPPOSITE OF RACES I AM SAYING MERIT SHOULD DECIDE MERITHOUDECIDE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADVOCATING FOR D E I IN THESE PROFESSIONS THEY ARE THE RACES THEYARE EXPLICITLY SAYING THAT RACE IS THE ONLY RELIVANT FACTOR THAT YOU BEAPLE TO OVERCOME MERIT YAND THIS IS DANGEROUS STUFF BECAUSE PEOPLE DIE ALL THE TIME AND HOSPITALS PEOPLE DIE ALL THE TIME FROM MEDICAL MAL PRACTICE FROM MEDICAL ERROR AND GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY IS A MEDICAL SCHOOL OR IS A COLLEGE OF SURGENTS TO SUGGEST THAT D E I OUGHT TO BE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE THERE OUGHT TO BE ONLY ONE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE AND ONE  GOVERNING  PRINCIPLE ALONE AND THAT GOVERNING PRINCIPLE OUGHT TO BE THE MERIT OF THE DOCTOR THAT'S IT THERE IS NO OTHER GOVERNING PRINCIPLE AS A PATIENT THT IS WHAT I CARE ABOUT WHEN I PUT MY KIDS IN THE CARE OF A DOCTOR OR A SURGEON GOD FORBID THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS WHETHER THAT PERSON IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF ME OR MY KID I DO NOT CARE AT ALL ABOUT THE RACE OF THE PERSON AND THE FACT NAT THAT COLOR BLINDNEES IS NOW SEEN AS RACISM AND OF THE CORRECTIVE TO THAT IS ACTUAL RACISM IS TOTALLY INSAN IS CAN GET PEOPLE KILL IT LEGITIMATELY WILL GET PEOPLE KILLEDYOULL

PERO S A HORRIFYING STORY OVER THE WEEKEN ACCORDING TO C ANN THERE HAS BEEN SUSPECT IN THE KILLING OF AN AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF NURSING STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA CAMPUS IN AFINS THE YOUNG WOMAN'S NAME WAS LAKEN HOPE RILY WHO 'S A JUNIOR ON THE DEANSLEST AT AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA POLICECHIEVE  JEFF CLARK IT WAS A CRIME OF OPPORTUNITY BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WOKE UP WITH BAD INTENTIONS TO WHO EXACTLY IS THE ALLEDGED MURDERER WHELE THE POLICE OR RECOMENDING CHARGES AGAINST A TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD INCLUDING FELLING MURDER FALSE IMPRISSMAN KINNAPPING AND CONCEALING THE DEATH OF ANOTHER IN RILE'S KILLING TO EXACTLY WAS THE SUSPECT WHELE TURNS OUT THAT THE SUSPECT WAS WAIT FOR IT INYLY LEMIGRANS THIS PERSON IS UNDOCUMENTED APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO A MEMBER OF THE GEORGIA LEGISLATURE THE SUSPECT WAS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY HAVING CROSSE THE BORDER IN OU PASOTECAS INTWO THAUSIN TWENTY TWO HO'S APPREHENDHED AT THE BORDER AND RELEASED INTO THE UNITED STATES NOW AGAIN THAT IS THE CATTIONRELESE PROGRAMMES TDEBIE ADMINISTRATION AS PUT IN PLACES ALL BOUT T EA REMEMBER DIVERSE PEOPLE GET TO BREAK THE LAW THAT'S THE WAY THAT TIS WORKS THE SUSPECT WAS ARRESTED IN QUEENS NEW YORK FOR AN INJURY TO A CHILD AND HAVING NO LICENS THAT WAS IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUT GAIN NEW YORK CITY ALSO HAS A D  IPOLICY WHEREBY THEY'VE DECIDED THAT CRIME IN OBJECTIVE METRIC IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT TO DECIDE WHETHER SOME ONE OUGHT TO GO TO JAIL OR BE DEPORTED IF TWO MANY BLACK OR HISPANNIC PEOPLE ARE BEING ARRESTED AND OR TEPORTED WELL THAT MUST MEAN THAT THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND WE HVE TO GET RID OF THE METRIC ITSELF THE SUSPECT AND HIS BROTHER RECITED IN AFINS CLARK COUNTY IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR SHOPLIFTING THE SUSPECT EVEN HAD N OW STANDING BENCH WARRANTS AS OF  DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR FAILING TO APPEAR IN COURT ON THE CHOPLIFTING CHARGES THE SUSPECTS BROTHER WAS CHARGED YESTERDAY BY FEDERAL

AND FAILURE TO LEA YIELD TO AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE AND WAS ARRESTED AGAIN IN DECEMBER SO JOBYDEN HAS TAKEN UP D YIAT EVERY LEVEL OF HIS ADMINISTRATION THAT MEANS WITH REGARD TO EMIGRATION POLICY AS WELL IN PEOPLE ARE DEAD BECAUSE OF IT THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHORE CROSSING THE BORDER AR CRIMINALS OTHER THAN THE ILLEGAL CROSSING OF THE BORDER IT IS TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU LET PEOPLE IN AND YOU DON'T LET THEM AND YOU OVE NO IDEA WHY THEYRE HERE AND THEN YOU ARREST THEM MULTIPLE TIMES AND RELEASE THEM WITHOUT THE PORTING THEM PEOPLE LIE THEY SHOULD BE VERY OBVIOUS STUFF ICE PUT OUT A STATEMENT AS WELL THEY SAY THAT THE TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD CITIZEN OF VENISUAYLE WAS ARRESTED BY C B PIECE SOFTEMBER EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY TWO AFTER UNLAWFULLY ENDTERING THE UNITED STATES NEAR A POSSO TAXIS HE'S PAROLED AND RELEASE FOR FURTHER PROCESSY ON SEPTEMBER FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THREE HE'S RRESTED BY THE AN WHY PETY AND CHARGE HE WAS RELEASED BY THE UNWIPUTY BEFORE ANY DETAINER COULD BE ISSUED AND THEN ON FEBRARY TWENTY TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY FOUR EARRO ATLANTA ENCOUNTERED THIS PERSON PURSUING TO HIS ARREST BY THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND BEING CHARGED WITH MURDER AND OTHER CRIMES AND FINALLY EARO ATLANTA LODGED A DETAINER A THIS IS THE PURE AND OBVIOUS OUTCOME OFV A HURRIFIC EMIGRATION POLICY UNDERTAKCUN BY THIS AD MINISTRATION NONE OF THIS HAD TO HAPPEN Y UHOW WE KNOWN IT DIDN'T HAVETO HAPPEN THIS JOBIDON IS NOW CONSIDERING TAKING EXECUTIVE ACTIONS WHO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING JOBID NOW ANTS TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF ASYLUM AT THE BORDER SO AS TO REJECT PEOPLE AT THE BORDER RATHER THAN PROCESSING THEM AND LETTING THEM INTO THE COUNTRY FOR NON SPECIFIED AT PERIOD OF TIME TAMMY DUCKWORTH VERY LIBERAL SENATOR SHE SAYS THAT YHOU'D BACK JOBITNS EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO STOP ASYLUM CLAMS WHICH BY THE WAY IS IN AN OF ITSELF A TACIT ADMISSION TO ALL THE CHARGES REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN MAKING ABOUT BAD DEMOCRATIC EMIGRATION POLICY THE BI ADMINISTRATIONS CONSIDERING USING EXACT TAT OF ACTION TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR MIGRANTE TO CLAIM ASYLUM WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT I WOULD SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A CRISIS AT THE PORTER  BUT I ALSO THINK THT SOMETHING DONA TRUNK TRIED WELL YOU KNOW WHAT DOTTO TRUMP HAS  HAS PACKED AWAY FROM THIS AS PART OF THAT PACKAGE THERE WAS MORE MONEY FOR A WHOLE BINTS OF THINKS TO INCLUDE A WERE AA A WORKER PROGRAMS O THAT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY GO TO WORK AT WHILE THEY'RE WAITING FOR THEIR CASE TO BE ATUDICATED I THINK THAT IS QUICKLY IMPORTANT IS A WORK PARMET FOR FOLKS WHO COME HERE IF THEY WANT TO WORK WITL AS PUT THEM TO WORK I'VE GOT THE ACT IN DESTREETS LOOKING FOR WORKERS RETAILS OF  FOR WORKERS WHILE THEY'RE WAITING FOR THEI LET'S LET ALLOW HEM TO WORK SO THER AN THAT COMPROMISE IT'S EXACTLY THAT THERE WAS STUFF THE FIX THE OF THE BORDER PROBLEMS BUT ALSO ALLOWED US TO LET TO BE HUMANE ABOUT HOW WE TAKE CARE OF THE MICRANTS ER HERE AGAIN EEN DEMOCRATS ARE NOW REALIZING HON F POLITICAL LIABILITY THIS IS AND THEY SHOULD PRESIDENT TRUMK WAS ON THE ATTACK ABOUT THIS OVER THE WEEKAND HE WAS SPEAKING AT SEAPACK AND HE HAD TALKED ABOUT JORBIDNSEMIGRATION POLICY AND SO IT'S IT'S FUNNY TO WATCH DEMOCRATS TO CRY TRUMP FOR SAYING WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY THROUGH HERE WE HAVE A NEW CATO GOIN MYGRIN CRIME AND IT'S GOING TO BE MORE SEVERE THEN VIOLENT CRIME AND CRIME AS WE KNOW IT BECAUSE WE HAVE MILLIONS AND MILIONS OF PEOPLE AND THEY CAME FROM PRISONS AN JAILS THEY CAME FROM MENTALINSTITUTIONS ANDSAN THE SYLUMS KNOW THE NOT THE SAME SAY AND IN SANESO EM IS TA MENTAL INSTITUTION ON STERITSIT'S A SILENCE OF THE LAMPS HE CA YOU KNOW THE HADABOLECTOR THEY'RE ALL BEING DEPOSITED INTO OUR COUNTRY AND THEN YOU HAVE TERS AND THEN YOU HAVE TRAS AND THEN YOU HAVE YUMAN TRAFFICERS AND THE COMING OVER IT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE WE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING OURAGE ABOUT TRUM SAYNG SUF LIKE THAT IT SEEMS TO ME SHULD BE A LOT MORE OUTRAGE ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW ILLEGAL IMIGRANTS SOMETIMES KILL AMERICAN CITICEN AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE HERE THAT'S WHAT'S TRULY OUTRAGEOUS I TELL ABOUT PREBORN A LOT ON THIS SHOW THAT'S BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THEIR MISSION REBORNS NETWORK OF CLINICS IS SAVING AS MANY BABIES AS POSSIBLE FROM THE CLUTCHES OF ABORTION THEIR CLINICS ARE LOCATED IN THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE NATION WHERE THE MAJORITY OF ABORTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE PREBORN OFFERS THESE EXPECTING MOTHERS FREE ULTRASOUNDS THEY BELIEVE WHEN A MOM HERES FOR BABIES HARDBEAT ON THE ULTRASOUND SHE USUALLY CHOOSES LIFE AND THAT'S TRUE IT'S AN AMAZING TRANS FOREMEN OF EXPERIENCE TO USE ULTRASOUND IVE FORKAS MET ALL OF THEM LONG BEFORE THEY WERE BORN VEAALS FORSOUND AND NOW PREBORN IS HELPING EXPECTANT MOMS DO THE SAME THEY RESCUE TWO HUNDRED BABIES EVERY DAY BUT BY THE TIME THIS MESSAGE IS DONE TWO MORE BABIES WILL HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES ABORTIONTINS ON CAN STOP WE NED EVERY ONE TO SAY ENOUGH AND HELP FIGHT SAVE THESE UNBORN CHILDREN IF YOU HAVE THE MEANS WOULD YOU CONSIDER A LEADERSHIP GEF TO SAVE BABIES IN A BIG WAY ATTACK SEDUCTABLE DONATION OF FIVE GRANDWILL SPONSE OR PREBORNS IN TIRENUTWORK FOR S TWENTY FOUR HOURS HELPING TO RESCUE TWO HUNDRED BABIES TO DON'T AGET SECURELY TOW POUNDS TO FIFTY SAY KEEWORD BABY THAT'S TOWN TWO FIVES ERO SAY KE WERE BABY OR GO TO PREBORN DOT COM AT SLASH BEN AGAN THAT'S PREBORN DOT COM AT SLASHBEN AND THIS IS WHAT TRUMP IS BANKING ON FOR HIS REALACT IS THAT BOTTOM LINE IS  JOBIDON HAS BEN A TERRIBLE PRESIDENT AND PEOPLE OF PAID THE PRICE BECAUSE JOBIDON IS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PRESIDENT AT SEE PACK PRESEN AND TRUMPLAS SAYNG THAT JOBINE IS DIRECTING THE COUNTRY TORD COLLAPSE AND CERTAINLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT AT LEAST A SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE WERN COUNTS ARD AT THE BORDER UNDER JOBIDON MILLIONS MORE NOT ENCOUNTERED SO ANYWORE BTEEN SEVEN AND TEN MILLION PEOPLE OF PROBABLY ENSTERED THE CONTRY LEGALLY SINCE JOBIDON TOOK OFFICE I MEAN THOSE ARE AWFUL NUMBERS AND TRUMP IS RIGHT TO POINTED OUT OVIOUSLY IF CROOKED JO BIDON AN IS TUGS WHEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE WORST IS YET TO COME A COUNTRY  WILL GO AN SINK TO LEVELS AT WE'RE UNIMAGINABLE AND JUST THINK ABOUT IT WITH FOR MORE

EX PRESIENT PREDICT A REELECTED TRUMP WOULD WAGE A MORE FOCUST THAN AGGRESSIVE ATTACK ON THE STATUS QUOT ANDMAN I CAN ONLY HOPE SO THIS TIME THAT HE THEY SAY HE'D BE FAR MORE KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF WIELDING EXECUTIVE POWER HAVING PLACED SO MANY CONSERVATIVES IN FEDERAL JUDGESHIPS HO'D FACE LESS RESISTANCE FROM THE COURT AND HE WOULD BE MORE DETERMINE TO PLACE LOYALISTS NOT RULES OBSESSED TRADITIONALISTS INSENIOR ROLES WENT MY GUESS IS THAT HE WOUD ACTUALLY BE MORE I HE WOULD BE MORE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE LOWER DOWN ON THE FOOD CHANE WERE PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T TO TEMPTING TO U NO DESTROY HIS PRESIDENCY FROM WITHIN SO WHAT EXACTLY IS SO SCARY APPARENTLY HE IS TALKING NOW ABOUT A SIXTEEN WEEK ABORTION BAD THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HE IS PUSHING A SIXTY  THAT BY THE WAY IS WAY LATER THAN VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY IN EUROPE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO SCARE PEOPLE HE APPARENTLY ALSO WANTS TO GO AFTER FEDERAL CLIMATE SCIENCE AND IN SURE T CAN'T BE USED TO GUIDE GOVERNMENT POLICIES WHICH UM LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS IT SHOULDN'T BE GUIDING EXECUTIVE POLICY IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MAKE DECISIONS TO CRIPPLE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY BAST ON THE GRADUAL WARMING OF THE CLIMATE OVER THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED YEARS USING MEASURES THAT WILL NOT MARKEDLY DECREASE THAT WARMING AND OUR HEAVILY RELIANT ON FORN COUNTRIES TO DO THE SAME WHEN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DO THAT LET YOUR LET YOUR LEGISLATORS BE PUNISHED FOR IT WHY SHOULD THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING ALL OF THAT TRUMP ALSO IS GOING TO TARGET CHINA HEIS GOING TO BUT TERIFF'S ON CHINA HE SAID ECONOMIC SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY CHINA IS NOT ALLOW AMERICAN COMPANIES TO TAKE OVER THE CRITICAL INFOSTRUCTURE AMERICA SH NOT ALLOWD CHINA TO TAKE OVER OUR CRITICAL IN FOR STRUCTURE HE SAID HE WOULD IMPOSE A FOR YOUR PLAN TO FACS OUT ALL CHINES IMPORTS OF A SENTURAL GOODS EVERYTHING FROM ELECTRONICS TO STEAL TO FARMASUTICLES MEAN AGAIN SHOW ME THE LAW WHERE IS THE PROBLEM OF THAT DO YOU WANT TO BE RELIANCE ON CHINESE FARMASUTICLES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CHINA INVADES TI ONE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE ABILITY OF AMER RICKINS TO GET VITAL GOODS GOES AWAY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PREPARE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT POLITICOES ALSO TRYING TO SCARRY THT HE'S GIN A WAGEOR CLASSROMORE A AND THIS IS ON OF THE LEFT FAVORITE GAMES IS THAT THEY DECLARE WAR ON SOMETHING PERFECTLY INOCUOUS LIKE A CLASSROOM BY TRYING TO SECTUALIZED CHILDREN AND THEN WHEN YOU SAY NO YOURE WAGING OU CLASSROUM WAR AND THIS IS ALL THE STUFF THAT SUPPOSED TO BE SCARING YOU I GOTTELL YO I DON'T SEEM SO SCARED ABOUT ALL OF IT W DON'T SEEM SUPERSCARED ABOUT IT ALSO APPARENTLY THEY'RE SAYING THAT DONAL TRUMS GEM DEPLOY YOU US TROOPS AGAINST AMERICANS OT WELL KNO ACTUALLY WHAT HE SAID IS THAT IF THERE IS A ROGUDS HE MIGHT CALL THE NATIONAL GUARD WHICH IS PRETTY SAYNG TO ME AND AS FAR AS THE NOTION THE'S GOING TO A BANDIN NADO THAT'S NOT TRUE WHAT HE SAYS IS THAT THE MEMBERS OF NATO NEED TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE HE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO STOP BEING A MEMBER OF NATO AND BY THE WAY IT'S WORKED THE MEMBERS OF NATOL ARE UPPING THERE OWN DEFENS SPENDING AND E'S GING TO LOOSEN THE RAINS ON

IN THE SELECTION AND THAT'S NOT REALLY BECAUSE OF TRUMP SO MUCH AS IT IS ABOUT YOBIDE RIGHT NOW IN THE REAL CLOPOLITICS PULLING AVERAGE DONAL TRUMP IS RUNNING FULLY ONE POINT NINE POINTS AHEAD OF JOBIDON AT THIS POINT IN THE LAST SELECTION CYCEL TOBIDON WAS RUNNING NEARLY FIVE POINTS AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMPET OF COURSE HE ONLY NARROWLY BEAT HIM IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE ACCORDING TO THE BRAN NEW HERIS EXP OLE THAT IS OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW DAYS TRUMPE IS UP FOR CORINT ECONIMOUST YOU GUP TRUMPS UP ONE ACORING TO MORNING CONSULT TRUMP IS UP FOR IF TRUMP IS UP IN THE POPULAR VOTE TRUM SWINTING THE ELECTION IF TRUMPS EVEN WITHIN A POINT IN H POPULAR VOTE TRUMP IS GOING TOWIN THE ELECTION SO TRUMP IS IN PRETY GOO SHAPE BUT HE DOES HAVE A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM THAT HE HAS IS CAN HE GET LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS TO THE POLES BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TRADEAD HIGH PROPENSITY VOTERS FOR LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS HAPPEN NOW DEMOCRATS OF SORT OF DUM IN THE SAME IT'S REALLY WEIRD BOTH PARTIES HAVE DECIDED THAT THE MEDIAN VOTER THE HIGH PROPENSITY MEDIAN VOTER IS NO LONGER A PERSON WORTH PER SUING SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATE TO VOTER TURN OUT IT'S NOT JUST CAN YOU GET A CERTAIN PER CENTAGE OF A POPULARY A POPULATION BASE TO VOTE IN YOUR FAVOR ARE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF WHITES OR BLACK AOLETINOS WENT YOU FAVOR IT'S HOW OFTEN THOSE GROUPS VOTE ARE THEY HIGH PROPENSIT VOTERS OR ARE THEY LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE WIDE DISPARITIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT GROUPS BASED ON AGE BASED ON RAGE BASED ON EDUCATION BASED ON FAMILY IN COME IN WHO IS A VOTER AND WHO IS A NON VOTER HUGE DISPARITIES SO IF YOU TAKE A LOK FOR EXAMPLE AT TWENTY TWENTY TWO WRITE THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THAT AMONG VOTERS THE NUMBER OF OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINES WAS REALLY REALLY LOW TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINES DID NOT VOTE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO ELECTION ONLY TEN PER CENT DID THE SAME THING WAS TRUE OF THIRTY TO FORTY NINUROLDS THIRTY CEVEN PER CENT OF THIRTY TO FORTY NINEROLDS DID NOT VOTE THEY REPRESENTED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE NON VOTERS RATHER THEY ARE REPRESENTANLY TWENTY SIX PER CENT OF VOTERS SO THE OVER REPRERSENTING GROUPS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR S PEOPLE DON'T VOTE ARE PEOPLE AGE SIXTY FIVE PLUSS PEOPLE ORE AGE SIXTY FIVE PLUS DEFINITLY BENIFIT TRUMP SOS ARE HIGHER PROPENSITY VOTERS HOWEVER THEY'RE OTHER CROSS CUTTING CONSIDERATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENSY TWO WHITES ARE OVERREPESENTED IN TERMS OF BEING HIGH PROPENSITY VOTERS SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WERE WHITE COMPARED WITH FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF NON VOTERS NINE PERSENT ORE BLACK NINE PER CENT ORE HASBENIC THREE PER CENT REATION HISPANNIC ARE WILDLY UNDER REPRESENTED THERE I VERY LOW PROPENSITY GROUP SO IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN YOURE HAT YOURE CONTING ON HEAVY LETZENO TURN OUT TO JOGUED VICTORY OR FOIR DEMOCRAT DOING THE SAME THOSE THAT THAT'S A LOW PROPENITY VOTING GROUP BLACK AMERICANS TYPICALLY ARE A ARE A LOW PROPENSITY VOTING GROUP WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION HOWEVER IU THAK LOOK AT AT TO WHITES OVERREPRESENTED OLD PEOPLE OVERREPRESENTED BUT WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE THEY TEN TO BE COLLEGE GRADUATES SO IF YOU ARE A HIGH SCHOOL OR LESS VOTER THAT BE A LOT OF TRUM WHITE VOTERS ARE HIGH SCHOLE LESS VERY LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF VOTERS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO HAD A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE OR LESS IN TERMS OF EDUCATION COMPARED TO FORTY THREE PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT VOTE IF YOU HAVE SOME COLLEGE THEN YOU'RE PETTY MUCH EQUALLY LIKELY TO VOTE NOT VOTE IF YOU ARE A COLLEGE GRAT OR A POST GRAD YOUR SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY D VOTE SO THIS IS WHY FOR EXAMPLE DEMOCRATS ARE VOTE ORE FOCUSSING IN ON THE VIEWS OF THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE LADIES IN THE SUBURBS THOSE ARE VERY HIGH PROPENSITY VOTERS BUT THEY'RE THEN ACCOMPANYING THAT WITH LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS BLACK IN HIS PANIC VOTERS IN MAJOR URBAN AREAS FOR EXAMPLE AT'S A WEIRD COALITION MEANWHILE REPUBLICANS HAVE ALSO BEAR BUILT A WEIRD COALITION THERE WEIRD COALITION IS HIGH PROPENSITY VOTERS NAMELY OLD WHITE PEOPLE BUT ALSO VERY LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS NAMELY HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED POOR WHITE PEOPLE ORE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO VOTE SAVE A COALITION IN BOTH PARTIES OF SOME HIGH PROPENSITY VOTERS IN A LOT OF LOW PROPENSITY VOTES THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET YOUR LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS TO VOTE THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION BECAUS NEITHER PARTY CAN AFFORD TO LOSE A LOT HERE I SO IF YOU ARE DONALD TRUMP HAD DO GET THOSE LOW PROPENITY VOTERS OUT TO THE POLES WELL DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY DOES HAVE A HABIT OF GETTING LOW PROPENSITY HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED WHITE MALS FOR EXAMPLE OUT TO VOTE IN BROADER NUMBERS CAN JO BIDN DO THE SAME WITH MINORITIES IT'S THE REASON RIGHT NOW WHY HE'S TRYING TO CAPITULATE THE COMMOSS IT'S THE REASON WHY HE'S PLAIN FOOTSEE WITH THE WITH THE RADICALS IN MICHIGAN IT'S THE REASON WHY HE REFUSES TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WOULD CRACK DOWN ANY LEGAL IMIGRATION UP TILL NOW HE'S TRYING TO TO PLEASE A LOW PROPENSITY VOTING GROUP YOUNG PEOPLE VERY LOW PROPENSITY VOTING GROUP HE'S TRYING TO PLEASE THOSE PEOPLE ANLOW PROPENSITY VOTIN GROUPS LIKE LIKE BLACK AMERICANS HE THINGS THAT IF HE CATERS TO THAT VOTING GROUP THEY'LL SHOW UP IN BROUGHTENA LOW PROPENSITY MEANS LIKELYHOOD D VOTE RITYPICALLY THE WAY THAT YOU WIN IN ELECTION IF YOU WANT ONE ELECTION YET EVERYBODY WHO IS LIKE SIXTY PER CENT OR UP IN TERMS OF VOTING FOR YOU TO GET TO THE POLES AND THEN YOU CAN VINCE EVERYBODY WHOS LIKE FORTY PER CENT OR UP ON VOTING FOR YOU GETS THE POLSE THOSE WHO BE INDEPENDENT VERY OFTEN PEOPLE WHO VOTALOT BUT YOU'RE NOT SHURE WICH FOR THER IN VOTE NOBODY IS AIMING AT THE MEDIAN VOTER ANY MORE IT'S PRETTY IM PRESSIVE HOW EVERYONE IS STEADFASTLY IGNORING THE MEDIAN VOTER WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE WHY NICKEY HALEY PULLS REALLY WELL IN GENERAL ELECTION TERMS BECAUSE SHE'S CONTINTERMNS F HOR POSITIONING SHE ECTIUL CLOSER TO CON THE MEDIAN VOTER NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT YHOU'D EVER WIN A PRIMARY INSIDE THE R PUBLICAN PART THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS NOW WHICH IS WHAT HAPPEN IN SOUTH CAROLINA THE OTHER DAYS WHON SOUTH CAROLINA DONALD TRUMP BLUE NICKEY HALEY AWAY HE WANT A TWENTY POINT VICTORY OVER NICKEY HALEY IN SOUTH CAROLINA'S FREPUBLICAN PRIMARY THAT OF COURSE IS WHERE SHE WAS A THE GOVERNOR THAT WAS HER HOME STATE AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY ACTION TOLD THAT STAFF SUNDAY YOU WOULD STOP SUPPORTING HER FINANCIALLIYST THIS RACE IS EFFACTIVELY OVER FOR HER SHOE DOES'T HAVE THE MONEY TO KEEP RUNNING SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING A CONTINUE TO STAY IN I ASSUME THE REASON THAT SHE IS STAYING IN IS BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THAT IF SHE STAYS IN AND IF DONLD TRUMP GETS THE NOMINATION THAT HE LOSES SHE'S GONE BE ABLE TO STAYLESS AND I OFFERED YOU AN ALTERNATIVE TRY ME GIVE ME A SHOT NEXT TIME AROUND CO SHOVIOUSLYTINGON WIN THE NOMINATION THIS TIME HERE'S NICKEY HALEY SOUTH CAROLINA I WOULD CONTINUE TO RIN I NI GIVING UP THIS FI WHEN A MEN TORDIVE MERI CANS DIS A TRUTH OF BOTH DONEL TRUMP AND JO BIY OGET AND THEN SHE SAYS THE DONAL TRUMP DRIVES PEOPLE AWAY AND BY POLLING DATA SHE HAS CORRECT DOWN TRUM IS A HIGHLY POLORIZING FIGURE THAT GIVEN TOBITONS MURIAD FAILURES AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TRUMP SHOLD BE UP TEN POINTS OVER JOBIDON AT THIS POINT EVEN THOUGH HE IS UP VERY SLIGHTLY IN THE POLES RIGHT NOW SO WHAT CAN TRUMP DU TO FIX THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A SECOND HERE IS NICKEY AILY THIS HAS  NEVER BEN ABOUT ME ON MY POLETICAL FUTURE WE NEED TO BED JU BIDIN IN NO VEMBERI TUBELE DONL TRUMP CAN BE JOBI NERLY EN TREE DAY TRUMP TRUNS PEOPLE AWAY  TOTIN WIT THIS TOMMENTS JEST YESTERDAY YET THAT MAY VERY WELL BE TRUE TRUM HIMSELF SAYS THAT HE AS NEVER SEEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS UNIFIED AS IT IS RIGHT NOW BUT THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT TRUE I MEAN HE IS THE INCUMBEN PRESIDENT HE ONLY ONE BUT WHEN I SAY ONLY THAT THE BIG VICTORY TWENTY POINTS BUT THE AREDICALLY HE SHO N EIGHTY TWENTY NOT SIXTY FORTY THA MEANS THAT FORTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE VOTING THE SOUTH CARELINE PRIMARY DID NOT WANT TRUMP NOW IT IS AN OPEN PRIMARY THERE ARE DEMOCRATS FOR VOTING IN THAT PRIMARY BUT NOT EVERYBODY WHO OUT ER FR NICKEY HAILEY IS A DEMOCRAT  HER IS TRUMP TRALK AOUT THE UNITY INSIDE THE PARTY NOW THIS A SPIRIT THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN WERIN TO GRI RA S  E EVER E   EVER THIS NEVER TEN ASPIRT LI THI AN I JUST GON TO SAY THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE REPUBLICAN BADY SO UNIFY AS O E TRAVER E SO WHAT IS TRUMP STRATEGY GOING TO BE HERE U SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO TRY TO DIVERSIFY OUT HIS BASE BY PICKING SOMEON ELIKE TIM SCOT FOR VICE PRESIDENT I THINK THE ANSWER HERE FOR FOR TRUMP REALLY IS THAT I I THINK THAT HE FIGURES HE'S GOT EVERYBODY IN THE LOW PROPENSITY CATEGARY HI'S GON AVOVOTING MAYBEE TAX TO THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF POSITION AND HOPES THAT INDEPENDENT VOTER BREAKS FOR HIM WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S REALLY COUNTING ON MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS FOREBIDING NOT TO BE ABLE TO TURN OUT THE LOW PROPENSITY VOTER THT'S HOW A TERRIBLE BAT IT JUST MEANS THE ELECTIONS CAN BE REALY REALLY CLOSES WHEN YOU'RE BETTING ON THE OTHER SIDE TO FAIL AS OPPOSED YOURSELF TO SUCCEED THAT CAN BE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM IT ELS IT DOESN'T HELP WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MY LANDELL WHIS IVAS THE BIG TRUMPBACKER OUT THERE TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE BY MAIL LIKE ST DUD STOP STOP IF YUIF YOU WANT TRUMP TO WIND YOU NEED REPUBLECANS VOTING BY MAIL AND YOU NEED THE VOTING EARLY LIKE JUST GET THEM TO VOT BUT HERE'S ROVER LODED FRORAN OL THER WE HAUT THAT

WHO ARE WORSE THAN THE LEGACY MEDIA TO BE TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU I MEAN AN INIS ACROSS THE BOARD JUST THE DISCONNECT THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN ORE LEGACY MEDIA AND THEAMERICAN PUBLIC IS UTTERLY WILD FOR EXAMPLE HERE IS A POLITICAL REPORTER ON EMUSAN BE SEE EXPLAINING THAT ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN GOD GIVEN RIGHTS IS ACTIALLY A CHRISTIAN NATIONALISTS SO THIS WHAT THE LEFT US THEY TAKE AN ACTUAL TERM AND THEN THEY BROUDEN OUT THE DEFINITION TO EXTO TO INCLUDE EVERYONE THEY HATE RIGHT SO WHITE SUPREMACY IS A TERM WITH A MEANING AND THEN THEY EXTHET THE EXPAND THAT OUT TO INCLUDE ANY ONE WHO THINKS FOR EXAMPLE THAT MERITOCRACY IS GOOD YOU ARE NOW WHITE TO PRIMISIST SO CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM IS A TERM WITH AN ACTUAL MEANING WHAT IT TYPICALLY MEANS IS SOMETHING AKIN TO THEOCRACY THAT LAW SHOULD BE CHRISTIAN IN ORIENTATION NOT JUST THAT IT SHOULD TAKE ITS VALUES FROM CHRISTIANITY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I GENERALLY AGREE WITH IN THE UNITED STATES NOT THAT YOU SHOULD BE MAN TATED TO GO TO CHURCH BECAUSE TERE IS A SEPARATION OF CHURCHAN STATES TO THAT EXTENT BUT THAT THE MORAL UNDER PINNING OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS ROOTED IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY THAT MTHERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT IS TRUE ABY THE WAY SO IS SECULAR ISIN IN THE WEST THEY'RE ROOTS HISTORICALLY IN CHRISTIANITY CLEARLY BUT WHAT THEY SAY IS THE CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM MEANS ANYTHING THAT INVOKES GOD IS NOW CHRISTIAN NATIONALISMS THAT'S HW YOU END UP WITH THIS IDIOTIC REPORTER HIDY CHRISBULA TRYING TO CLAIM THAT THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IS A CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST DOCUMENT THE ONE THING THAT UNIT TOLE BECAUSE HERE'S MANY A DIFFERENT CRIPS ORBITING TRUMPIT THE THING THAT WRI OT UNITES THEM AS CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST NOT CHRISTIANS BY THE WAY BECAUSE CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST THIS VERY DEF IS THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT OUR RIGHTS AS THEAMERICANS AS ALL HUMAN BEINGS DON'T COME FROM ANY IRTHLE AUTHORITY THAT COME FROM CONGRESS THAT A CONFESS PIN COURT THEY COME FROM GOD YOU MEAN LIKE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE T THAT THAT'S LITERALLY THE DECLARATION INDEPENDENCEISSHES CALLING A CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST DOCUMENT NOW S AGAIN IF YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT YOU ARE JUST WHATEVER IS THE EVIL TERM OF THE DAY BY THE WAY THE CUORRELLARY TO WHAT SHE SAYING IS TIT THE ONLY WAY TO BE NOTA CHRISTIAAN NATIONALIST IS TO BELIEVE THAT RIGHTS COME FROM GOVERNMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT GRANTS YOU RIGHTS WHICH OF COURSE IS RIDICULOUS BECASE THAT ASSUMES THAT ALL POWER INEATLY RESIDES NOT WITH THE PEOPLE NOT WITH INDIVIDUALS NOW THE FAMILIES NOW TH COMMUNITIES BUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT IT WORKS THE ENTIRE BASIS FOR AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS THAT WE GRANTED GOVERNMENT CERTAIN SPECIFIED POWERS IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES SPECIFIED POWERS NOT UNLIMITED POWERS AND THAT WE RESERVE RIGHTS TO OURSELV AND THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT INVADES THOSE RIGHTS THE GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO DO ITS JOB AND IN FACT HAS DESTROYED IT'S REASON FOR EXISTENCE BUT THAT'S NOW I GUESS I A CHRISTIAN NATIONALISTS PERSPECTIVE O GOOD NEWS GUISE I GUESS AI'M NOW CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST IF THAT'S THE WAY THE THAT WORKS AREADY FOLKS IN JUST ONE SECOND WE'LL JUMP INTO THE S AN L EPISODE STARRING

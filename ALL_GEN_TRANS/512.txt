WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LADPODCAS WTHS A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO FORI M INDREWHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEURBOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING DOCTOR MATTHEW WALKER AS OUR GUEST ON THE HUBERMAN LADPODCAST DOCTOR WALKER IS A PROFESSOR OF NEURO SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSY OF CALIFORNIA BERKLEEP THERE HIS LABORATORY STUDIES SLEEP THEY SCUDY WHY WE SLEEP WHAT OCCURS DURING SLEEP SUCH AS DREAMS AND WHY WE DREAM LEARNING DURING SLEEP AS WELL AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF GETTING INSUFFICIENT OR POOR QUALITY SLEEP ON WAKING STATES DOCTOR WALKER IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL BESSELLING BOOK WHY WE SLEEP OUR DISCUSSION TO DAY IS AN ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING ONE FOR ANY ONE THAT'S INTERESTED IN SLEEP LEARNING OR HUMAN PERFORMANCE OF ANY KIND DOCTOR WALKER TEACHES US HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING HE ALSO DISCUSSES NAPS WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT NAP WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN COMPENSATE FOR LOST SLEEP AND IF SO HOW TO BEST DO THAT WE DISCUSS BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALS AND INTERACTIONS WITH LIGHT TEMPERATURE SUPPLEMENTATION FOOD EXERCISE SECS ALL THE VARIABLES THAT CAN IMPACT THIS INCREDIBLE STATE OF MIND AN BODY THAT WE CALL SLEEP DURING MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER I'VE READ MANY PAPERS ABOUT SLEEP AND ATTENDED MANY SEMINARS ABOUT SLEEP YET MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR WALKER TO DAY REVEAL TO ME MORE ABOUT SLEEP SLEEP SCIENCE AND HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING THAN ALL OF THOSE PAPERS AND SEMINARS COMBINED I'M ALSO DELIGHTED TO SHARE THAT DOCTOR WALKER HAS STARTED A PODCAST THAT PODCAST ENTITLED THE MAT WALKER PODCAST RELEASES ITS FIRST EPISODE THIS MONTH AND IS GOING TO TEACH ALL ABOUT SLEEP AND HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING SO BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE MAT WALKER PODCAST ON APPLE SPOTIFY OR WHEREVER YOU LISTEN TO PODCAST BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCINCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS

ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLIES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MAGNESIUM AND PETASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZE IF THE ELECTROLIYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONT SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK

CAM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR MAT WALKER GREAT TO FINALLY MEET YOU IN PERSON WONDERFUL TO CONNECT M I MEAN ITS BEING TOO LONG BUT I SUSPECT IT WOULD HAVEBEENISIOS TO TIME BEFORE WE'VE MET LEST THE PANDEMIC NM THANK YOU NOWMYOU A I'M DELIGHTED THAT WE'RE FINALLY SEING DOWN FACES TO FACE I'VE BEEN TRACKING YOUR WORK BOTH IN THE INTERNET SPHERE AND I READ YOUR BOOK AND LOVED IT AND ALSO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SCIENCE YOU ACHY CAME TO STAMFORD COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND GAVE A ELECTURE A FOR BRAINMIND O YA YEE  AND UM THERE OF COURSE  YOU TALKED ABOUT SLEEP IN ITS UTILITY AND ITS CHALLENGES AND HOW TO A AND HOW TO CONQUER IT SO TO SPEAK UM LET'S START OFF VERY BASIC WHAT IS SLEEP SLEEP IS PROBABLY THE SINGLEMOST EFFECTIVE THING YOU CAN DO TO RESET YOUR BRAIN UM BUDY HEALTH SO THAT'S A FUNCTIONAL ANSWER INTEMS OF NOW WHAT IS SLEEP INTEMSOF ITS BENEFITS SLEEP IS A PROCESS THOUGH IS AN INCRANTIBLY COMPLEX PHYSIOLOGICAL BALLE AND IF YOU  TO RECOCNIZE O SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BRAIN ND YOUR BODY AT NIGHT DURING SLEEP YOU WOULD BE BLOWN AWAY AND THE PARADOX IS THAT MOST OF US AND I WOULD THINK THIS TOO YOU KNOW IF I WASN'T TO SLEEP SCIENTIST WE GO TO BED WE LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS FOR SEVEN TO NINE HOURS AND THEN WE SEIT OF WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND WE GENERALLY FEEL BETTER AND IN SOME WAYS THAT DENIES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL BEAUTY OF SLEEP SO UPSTAIRS IN YOUR BRAIN WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEEP THE THE CHANGES IN BRAINWAY OF ACTIVITY ARE FAR MORE DRAMATIC THAN THOSE THAT WE SEE WHEN WE'RE AWAKE AND WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT DEEP SLEEP ON WHAT HAPPENS THER REMSLEEP IS A FASCINATING TIME WHICH IS ANOTHER STAGE OF SLEEP OFTEN CALLED DREAM SLEEP WHICH IS RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP THAT STAGE OF SLEEP SOME PART OF YOUR BRAIN ARE UP TO THIRTY PER CENT MORE ACTIVE THAN WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE SO AGAIN IT'S CAN HAF VIOLATING THIS IDEA THAT ARE MIND IS DORMANT AND OUR BODY IS JUST SIMPLY QUIESCENT AND AND RESTING SO I WOULD HAPPY TO DEST OF DOUBLE CLICK ON EITHER ONE OF THOSE AND ALSO WHAT CHANGES IN THE BODY AS WELL BUT IT IS AN INTENSE EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTIVE BENEFIT AR AND SYSTEM THAT SAID THOUGH  I WOULD ALMOST PUSH BACK AGAINST A AND EVOLVED SYSTEM WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION OF SLEEP AND WHAT SLEEP IS OUR ASSUMPTION HAS ALWAYS BEIN THAT WE EVOLVED TO SLEEP AND HAVE ACHY QUESTION THAT AND I HAVE NO WATER GET IN A TIME CAPTUAE AND GO BACK AND PROVE THIS BUT WHAT IF WE STARTED OFF SLEEPING AND IT WAS FROM SLEEP THAT WAKEFULNESS EMERGED WHY DO WE ASSUME THAT IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND AND I THINK THIS PROBABLY SOME REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT SLEEP MAY HAVE BEEN THE PROTO STATE THAT IT WAS THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL LIVING STATE AND WHEN WE BECAME AWAKE AS IT WERE WE ALWAYS HAD TO RETURN TO SLEEP IN SOME WAYS AT THAT POINT SLEEP WAS THE PRICE THAT WE PAID FOR WAKEFULNESS AND THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF DESCRIBING WHAT SLEEP IS BUT AGAIN I THINK IT SAT OF DENIES THAT THE ACTIVE STATE OF SLEEP IT'S NOT A PASSIVE STATE OF SLEEP EITHER AND AND THEN FIND YOU CAN SAY WHAT WHAT IS SLEEP ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECIES AND IN US HUMAN BEINGS AND IN ORMEMALIAN SPECIES AND AVIAN SPECIES AS WELL SLEEP IS BROADLY SEPARATED INTO THESE TWO MAIN TYPES AND WE'VE GOT NON RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP ON THE ONE HAND AND THEN WE'VE GOT RAPID YE MOVEMENT SLEEP ON THE OTHER AND WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT HOW THEY UNFOLD ACROSS THE NIGHT AND THEIR ARCHITECTURE BEKERS IT'S NOT JUST INTELLECTUALLY INTERESTING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT SLEEP IS IT'S ALSO PRACTICALLY IMPACTFUL FOR OUR DAILY LIVES AND ID LOVE TO SIT O GO DOWN THAT ROOT TOO BUT YOU NAVIGATE YOU DOW ME I ON LET'S DEVIL END GO DOWN THAT ROOT SO O YOU MENTION HOW I T OF THE BRAIN IS DURING CERTAIN PHASES OF SLEEP WHEN I WAS COMING UP IN SCIENCE REMSLEE RAPID I MOVEANT SLEEP WAS REFERRED TO AS PARADOXICAL SLEEP YAS THAT STILL A GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT PARADOXICAL BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS SO ACTIVE AND YET WE ARE ESSENTIALLY PARALYZED CARRAT YET IT REALLY IS A PARADOX AND WHERE THAT CAME FROM WAS SIMPLY THE BRAINWAVE RECORDINGS THAT IF ALL I MEASURING ABOUT YOU IS YOUR BRAINWAVE ACTIVITY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME SITTING OUTSIDE OF THE SLEEP ABORATORY ROOM TO FIGURE OUT ARE YOU AWAKE WORRAR YOU IN REMSLEEP BECAUSE THOSE TWO PANS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY ARE SO CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THEM YET HE PARADOX IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE AWAKE I GO IN THERE AND YOUR SET OF SITTING UP YOUR CLEARLY CONSCIOUS IN AWAKE BUT YET WHEN YOU GO INTERREM SLEEP YOU ARE COMPLETELY PARALYED AND THAT'S ONE OF THE I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PARADOX BUT THE PARADOX REALLY JUST COMES DOWN TO TWO DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT CONSCIOUS STATES YET BRAIN ACTIVITY IS DRAMATICALLY MORE SIMILAR THAN DIFFERENT AND THE WAY I CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH OF THE TWO YOU ARE IN IS BY MEASURING TWO OTHER SIGNALS THE ACTIVITY FROM YOUR EYES AND THE ACTIVITY FROM YOUR MUSCLES SO WHEN WERE AWAKE WE WILL OCCASIONALLY HAVE THESE BLINKS AND WE'LL HAVE CERT OF SICADS BUT DURING REM SLEEP YOU HAVE THESE REALLY BAZAARE HORIZONTAL SHUTTLING EYE MOVEMENTS THAT ACCUR AND THAT'S WHERE THE NAME COMES FROM RAPID I MOVEMENTS THEY ALWAYS HORIZONTAL MOSTLY THEY ARE HORIZONTIALS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN DIFFERENTIATE THEM FROM OTHER WAKING I MOVEMENT ACTIVITY CAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS LET CAN BE SOMETIMES HORIZONTAL BUT CAN ALSO HAVE DIAGONAL AND ALSO VERTICAL IN THAT PLAINE BUT THEN THE MUSCLE ACTIVITY IS THE REAL DEAD GIVE AWAK JUST BEFORE YOU AND TO REM SLEEP YOUR BRAINSTEM WHICH IS WERE THE DINAMICS OF NONREM AND RAM ARE ESSENTIALLY PLAYED OUT AND THEN EXPRESSED UPSTAIRS IN THE QARTECS AND DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BODY AND WHEN WE GO INTO REM SLEEP AND JUST A FEW SECONDS BEFORE THAT HAPPENS THE BRAINSTEM SENDS A SIGNAL ALL THE WAY DOWN THE SPINAL CORD AND IT COMMUNICATES WITH WHAT ARE CALLED THE ALPHAMOTONURONS IN THE SPINAL CORD WHICH CONTROL OF VOLUNTARY SCLECAL MUSCLES AND IT'S A SIGNAL OF PARALYSIS AND WHEN YOU GO INTO DREAM SLEEP YOU ARE LOCKED INTO A PHYSICAL INCARCERATION OF YOUR OWN BODY AMEZN  YOU WHY WHY WOULD MOTHER NATURE DO SUCH A THING AND IT'S IN SOME WAYS VERY SIMPLE THE BRAIN PARALYZES THE BODY SO THAT THE MIND CAN DREAM SAFELY BECAUSE THINK ABOUT HOW QUICKLY WE WOULD HAVE ALL BEEN POPPED OUT OF THE GEAMPUL YUND IF I THINK I'M YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BEST SKY DIVERS WHO CAN JUST SIMPLY FLY AND I'VE HAD SOME TIMES THOSE DREAMS TOO YOU KNOW AND I GET UP ON MY APARTMENT WINDOW AND I LEAP OUT YOU DON'T YOU'RE DONE YOU KNOW SO THAT'S ONE OF THE SORT OF THAT PART OF THE PARADOX OF RAM SLEEP BOTH IT'S BRAIN ACTIVITY SIMILARITY DESPITE THE BEHAVORAL STATE BEING SO DIFFERENT AND THIS BAZAAR LOCK DOWN OF THE THE SIRT OF BRAIN OF THE BODY ITSELF NOW OF COURSE THE INVOLUNTARY MUSCLES THANKFULLY AUNT A PARALYZED SEE YOU KEEP BREATHING YOUR HEART KEEPS BEATING IS THIS WHY MEN HAVE ERECTIONS DURING RAMSLEEP AND WOMEN HAVE VAGINAL UBRIGATION DURING SLEEP THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON PART OF THE OTHER REASON THOUGH THERE IS BECAUSE OF THE AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY SO THERE IS ANERVOUS A PART OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CALLED THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IT CONTROLS MANY OF THE AUTOMATIC BEHAVIORS AND SOME OF THOSE RE ASPECTS F ARE REPRODUCTIVE FACILITIES DURING REMSLEEP WHAT WE LATER DISCOVERED IS THAT YOU GO THROUGH THESE BAZAAR WHAT WE CALL AUTONOMIC STORMS WHICH SOUNDS DRAMATIC BUT IT ACTUALLY IS WHEN YOU MEASURE THEM THAT YOU'LL GO THROUGH PERIODS WHERE YOUR HEART RATE DECELERATES AND DROPS AND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE GOES DOWN AND THEN UTTERLY RANDOMLY YOUR HEART RATE ACCELERATE DRAMATICALLY AND WHAT WE CALL THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT BRANCH OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OR THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BADLY NAME CAUSE IT'S ANYTHING BUT SYMPATHETIC ITS VERY AGGRAVATING AN THAT ALL THE SUDDEN FIRES UP AND THEN IT SHUTS DOWN AGAIN AND IT'S NOT IN ANY REGULAR WAY ND IT'S WHEN YOU GET THOSE AUTONOMIC STORMS YOU GET VERY ACTIVATED FROM A PHYSIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU CAN HAVE THESE ERECTIONS AND YOU HAVE FATIONAL DISCHARGEICS O YOU'RE TOLAL ARALYZED BUT YOU ARE STILL PARALYZED THERE ARE ONLY AM TWO VOLUNTARY SGO AT TWO VOLUNTORY MUSCLE GROUPS THAT ARE SPURRED FROM THE PARALYSIS BAZAAR ONE YOUR EXTRA OCULAR MUSCLES BECAUSE IF THEY WERE PARALYED YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HAVE RAPID EYE MOVEMENTS AND THE OTHER THAT WE LATER DISCOVERED WAS THE INNER EAR MUSCLE AND WE'VE GOT NO GOOD UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY THOSE TWO MUSCLES GROUPS ARE SPURRED FROM THE PARALYSIS IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH CRANIAL NERVE BUT I A I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT I THINK IT'S PERHAPS SOMETHING MORE SENSORY RELATED SOME PEOPLE OF ARGUED THAT THE REASON THE EYEBLLS ARE SPURRED FROM THE PARALYSIS IS BECAUSE IF YOUR IEBLLS ARE LEFT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME INACTIVE YOU MAY GET THINGS SUCH AS OXYGEN SORT OF ISSUES IN THE AM EQUEOUS ORVITORIOUS HUMOR AND SO THE IBLLS HAVE TO KEEN THE GRAININ SEMDINGS OF THE ANTERIOR I ARE I MADE REQUIRE MOVEMENT EXACTLY PIMELICLARCOMA HAVE DATHE SAIDS IN AND DRAINAGE THROUGH THE ANDURO CHAMBER BUT THERE AM SPECULATING I'M ALSO SPECULATING WHEN I ASKE THIS AM I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE STATES IN WAKING THAT ALSO RESEMBLE SLOWWAVE SLE WERE RATHER THAT NER STATES THAT' SLOW WAVE SLEEP ALSO RESEMBLES WAKING STATES YOU'VE BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED HOW RAM SLEEP CAN MIMIC SOME OF THE MORE ACT OF BRAIN STATES THAT WE ACHIEVIN WAKING WHAT SORT OF WAKING STATE THAT I MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED OR EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY BASIS MIH LOOK SIMILAR TO SLOW WAVE SLEEP NONRAM SLEEP IF ANY IT'S GENIOUS WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT TURNS THE TABLS I LEV IT I'M WE ALMOST NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE THE THE TRUE ULTRUT SLOW WAVES OF DEEP NONREM SLEEP SO I'M WE SPOKE ABOUT THESE TWO STAGES NONRAMON RAM I'M NONRAM IS FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO FOUR SEPARATE STAGES I'M STAGES ON THROUGH FOR INCREASING IN THA DEPTH OF SLEEP SO STAGES THREE AND FOR THAT'S WHAT WE TYPICALLE CALLED DEEP NONRM SLEEP STAGES ONE AND TWO I MABN' TAKE ME THROUGH THE ARK OF A NIGHT JUST SO THEY I U SO I I PUT MY HEAD DOWN I WELL FOR YOU WAT WHAT'S I'M YOU NORMANLY GO TO SLEEP SO I'M USUALLY SIT OF AROUND ABOUT TEN THIRTY P M GY AND USUALLY I'LL NATURALLY WAKE UP SAID OF A LITTLE BIT BEFOR SEVEN SOMETIMES BEFOR SIX FORTY FIVE OR SEVEN I HAVEN ALARM SET FOR I'M SEVEN O FOR I'M A M YOUREE HERE FOLKS MA A AN AS USEIN ALARM A I REALLY AN REALLY I'M USUALY E  RION MAND IT BUT HE DOES USE IT YEI USUALLUSUALY LIMAN AFTER A OH I AM SO HUMAN IM AND AND I'VE HAVE MY SLEEPFISHES AND I'D LEFT TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT TOO BUT I'M IT'S ONLY JUST YOU KNOW IN THE EVENT THAT I'M YOU KNOW CAUSE I LIKE TO KEEP REGULARITY TO YOU'VE GOT TO KEEPH THOSE TWO THINGS IN BALANCE AND SEVEN O FOR JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY NOT BE ATIOSINCRACTIC I DON'T KNOW WHY WE ALWAYS SET THINGS ON THESE A HOD NUMBERS SO YEP SO WHEN SO YOU MI SLEEP ROUND TEN THIRTY SO YOSING YOU IS AN EXAMPLE IM AUS I IMAGINE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP AT DIFFERENT TIMES WITH TEN THORIES ABOUT WHEN I GO SLEV ELEVEN AS FOR ME BUT I'M SO YOU GO TO SLEEP AT TEN THIRTY SOVER THAT FIRST I'M LET'S SAY THREE HOURS OF SLEEP WHAT IS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THAT SLEEP LOOK LIKE AS COMPARED TO THE LAST THREE HOURS OF YOUR SLEEP AR BEFORE MORNING YE SO I SHOULD KNOTE THAT THAT'S  IF YOU KNOW TEN THIRTY TO SEVEN THAT'S JUST BASED ON MI CRON A TYPE AN MY PREFERENTIAL IT'S DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT'S THE PERFECT SLEEPS BUT FOR HUMANITIES SLEEP IT'S JUST MY BUT I'MAGIN MOST PLOPLE PROBABLY GO TO SLEEP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AN P M AN MIDNIGHT ETS O ABOULY LI NINHT AND MI NIGHE IVE A M AND SEVEN A M WERE OR FIVE THIRTY AND SEVEN THIRTY YE YE I'M AT LEAST IN IF YOU LOOK AT SO THE FIRST WELT NATIONS THAT'S THAT'S A TYPICAL SLEEP PROFILE I' SO WHEN I FIRST FULL ASLEEP I'LL GO INTO THE LIGHT STAGES OF NONREM SLEEP STAGES ONE AND TWO OF NONREM INM THEN I'LL START TO DESCEND DOWN INTO THE DEEP E STAGES OF NONREM SLEEP SO AFTER ABOUT MAYBE TWENTY MINUTES AN STARTING TO HEAD DOWN INTO STAGE THREE NONREM AND THEN INTO STAGE FOR NONREM SLEEP AND AS I'M STARTING TO FALL ASLEEP AS I'VE CAST OFF FROM THE ARD USUALLY WITH ME MURKY WATERS OF WAKEFULNESS A'M AND I'M IN THE SHALLOWS OF SLEEP STAGES ONE AND TWO MY HEART RATE STARTS TO DROP A LITTLE BIT AND THEN MY BRAINWAY PATERN ACTIVITY STARTS TO SLOW DOWN NORMALLY WHEN I'M AWAKE IT'S GOING UP AND DOWN MAY BE TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY TIMES ER SECOND AM AS I'M GOING IN TO LIGHT NONREM SLEEP IT WILL SLOW DOWN TO MAYBE FIFTEEN TWENTY AND THEN REALLY STARTS TO SLOW DOWN DOWN TO ABOUTS AT O TEN OR EIGHT CYCLES PER SECOND EIGHT CYCH OR WAVES PER SECOND THEN AS I'M STARTING TO MOVE IN TWO I'M STAGES THREE AND FOUR NONREM SLEEP ISEVERAL REMARKABLE THINGS HAPPEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY HEARTRAT REALLY DOES START TO DROP OH AND I'LL COME BACK TO TEMPERATURE I'M GOING TO WRITE TEMPERATURE DOWNCAS I ALWAYS FORGET THESE THINGS AND NOW I'M SARDLY IN THE FOOTHILLS OF MIDDLE AGE AN SO AS I'M STARTING TO GO INTO THOSE DEEPER STAGES OF NONREM SLEEP ALL OF A SUDDEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CELLS IN MY QUARTEX ALL DESIDE TO FIRE TOGETHER AND THEN THEY ALL GO SILENT TOGETHER AND IT'S THIS REMARKABLE PHYSIOLOGICAL COORDINATION OF THE LIKES THAT WE JUST DON'T SEE AT JORING ANY OTHER BRAIN STATE ANSTRILLIENTUALLY HAVING RECORDED FROM THE BRAINS OF OF ANIMALS AND ALLORBIT FROM HUMANS AN ONTHING I'VE EVER SEEN THE ENTIRE CORDECS OR EVEN ENTIRE REGIONS OF GROTACS LIGHT UP LIKE THAT IT'S IT'S  SNUNNING IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE THIS MUTREFUL SORT OF MANTRECHAND AN ALL THIS SURT OF YOU KNOW TO SLOW IN HAL AND THEN A MEDITATIVE EXHAL IN HAL EXHALE AND THESE WAVES ARE JUST ENORMOUS IN THEIR SIZE AN THE BODY IS CAPABLE OF MOVEMENT AT THIS TIME THERE IS NOS PARALYSIS THERE IS NO PARALYSIS BUT FOR THE MOST PART MUSCLE TONE HAS ALSO DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY TEREST AT THAT POINT AND THEN YOU WILL OR I WILL THEN STAY THERE FOR ABOUT ANOTHER TWENTY OR THIRTY MINUTES SO NOW I'M MAY BE SIXTY OR SEVENTY MINUTES INTO MY FIRST SLEEP CYCLE AND THEN I'LL START TO RISE BACK UP BACK UP INTO STAGE TWO NONREM SLEEP AND THEN AFTER ABOUT EIGHTY OR SO MINUTES I'LL POP UP AND I'LL HAVE A SHORT REM SLEEP PERIOD AND THEN BACK DOWN I GO AGAIN DOWN INTO NONREM UP INTO REM AND YOU DO THAT RELIABLY REPEATEDLY AND I WILL BE DOING THAT AND I DO DO THAT EVERY NIGHTY MINUTES AT LEAST THAT THE AVERAGE FOR MOST ADULTS IT'S DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT SPECIES WHAT CHANGES TO YOUR QUESTION IS THE RATIO OF NONREM TO REM WITHIN THAT NINETY MINUTES CYCLE AS YOU MOVE ACROSS THE NIGHT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES ARE COMPRISED OF LOTS OF DEEP NONREM SLEEP THAT'S WHEN I GET MY STAGE THREE AND FOUR OF DEEP NONREM SLEEP ONCE I PUSH THROUGH TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIG GHT NOW THAT CEASEFUL BALANCE CHANGES AND INSTEAD THE MAJORITY OF THOSE NINETY MENUTE CYCLES A COMPRISED EITHER OF THIS LIGHTO FORM OF NONREM SLEEP STACE TOO NONREM SLEEP IA'M MUCH MORE AND INCREASINGLY MORE RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP AND THE IMPLICATION THAT I WAS T OF SPEAKING ABOUT PRAGMATICALLY IS LET'S SEE THAT I'M I HAVE TO AND I USUALLY NEVER TO ATLY MORNING FLIGHTS OR RED EYES I'M JUST BECAUSE I'M A MASS IF THAT HAPPENS I'M NOT SUGGESTING UP OF THE PEOPLE SHOULDN'T I'M SUGGESTING TIS OLL NOT DO THAT A IM I'VE TAKEN A RED EYER I'VE DONE THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER I GET SOME SORT OF GENERAL FEELING MALAYS MY BRAIN DOESN'T WORK AS WELL I I THINK RED I SHOULD BE ABOLISHED I FOR THE PILOTS TOO I MOU KNO AND OH AN WE CAN FOR THE ABOUT THOSE ANDY ERERS THEINERGENCY REMEMBING LONG SHIFTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO OU KNO PHYSICIAN INDUCED A ERRORS THAT IL LEAD TO LOT OF FATALITIES I'M IN THEIR LOT OF REASONS WHY STAYING UP TOO LONG OR BEING UP AT THE WRONG TIMES IF YOU'RE NOT ADAPTED TO IS JUST TERRIBLE  THE DATRINOLL OF THOSE CASES YOU KNOW I'M PARTICULAR PHYSICIANS TOO THERE WAS SOME RECENT DAY TO LOOKING AT SUICIDE ALITY I'M THE RATES OF SUICIDE IN TRAINING PHYSICIANS A YOUV THOUG FAR ABOVE THE NOUM AND I DON'T SUSPECT THAT YOU KNOW THE CHETUALS O HELPING THEM I SUSPECT THAT SLEEP IS A MISSING THOUGHT OF THAT EXPLENETORY EQUATION BUT I TEACH MEDICAL STUDENTS AND AND THEY THE'RE PHENOMENAL BUT THEY YATHER UNDER EXTREMELY CHALLENGED CONDITIONS IT'S I SHOULDN'T PUT THEM UNDRNO ITAS NOT IT'S NOT OPTIMIZING PERFORMINGIS IM I'VE ONE SRRY I MUS SCIR NO NO THIS IS IS IMPORTANTHESE UM IT'S AN IMPORTANT DIGRESSION I HAVE ONE QUESTION WHICH IS YOUR SAYING THAT AS ACROSS THE NIGHT A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES ARE GOING TO BE OCCUPIED BY REM SLEEP AS YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE NIGHT I'M AWARE THAT THERE A BASED ON WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE AN AND I AND FROM YOUR PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS AND OTHERS IM THAT WE HAVE SO CALED CIRCADIAN FORCES AND WE HAVE OTHER FORCES THAT ARE DRIVING WHEN WE SLEEP AND WHEN WE WANT TO SLEEP ET CETERA WITHOUT GOING INTO THE DETAILS OF THOSE OF A SIMPLE QUESTION THE EXPERIMENT IS THE FALLOWING LET'S SAY GOD FORBID YOU ARE PREVENTED FROM GOING TO SLEEP AT YOUR NORMAL TIME YAND YOU STAY UP FOR THE FOUR HOURS OR FIVE HOURS THAT NORMALLY YOU WOULD BE IN PREDOMINANTLY SLOWWAY OF SLEEP YE IF LET SAY YOU FINALLY GET TO LIE DOWN AT THREE A M A TIME WHEN NORMALLY YOUR SLEEP WOULD BE OCCUPIED MOSTLY BY RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP YE WILL YOU EXPERIENCE A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP BECAUSE OF THESE SO CALLED CIRCADIAN FORCES MEANING THAT'S WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THAT TIME OR WILL YOUR SYSTEM NEED TO START AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RACE THAT WERE NAS  IS I'M REFERRING TO IT IR CALLING SLEEP IF FOR IF THAT'S NOT CLEARED ANYBODY BAS ON TO MASKING AS IF YOU ARE FORCE TO SKIP THE SLOWWAVE SLEEP PART OF THE NIGHT WILL YOUR SYSTEM LE P INTO RABIT I MOVMENT SLEEPER DOES IT HAVE TO START AT THE BEGINNING AND GET SLOWWAVE SLEEP FIRST IN OTHER WORDS DOES ONE SLEEP STATE DRIVE IN ANTRY TO THE NEXT SLEEP STATE GREAT QUESTION SO THERE IS SOME DEGREE OF RECAPROSITY BETWEEN THE SLEEP STATES I SHOULD NOTE THAT WHEN WE DRIVE ONE OF THOSE UP WE OFTEN BUT NOT ALWAYS SEE A A CHANGE IN THE OTHER THERE ARE SOME PHARMACOLOGIES THAT HAVE SHOWN AN INDEPENDENCE TO THAT AND WE'VE ALSO PLAYDROUM WITH THINGS LIKE TEMPERATURE AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN YOU KNOW NUDGE ONE AND NOT SEEM TO UPSET OR PERTUB THE OTHER BUT TO YOUR I'M I THINK LOVELY POINT THE ANSWER IS IT'S A MIX BUT IT'S MOST SLEEP THE LATTER MEANING YOU WILL MOSTLY GO INTO YOUR REM SLEEP PHASE IS AND BE SIGNIFICANTLY DEFICIONT IN YOUR DEEP SLEEP SO JUST BECAUSE I START MY SLEEP CYCHLE AT THREE A M RATHER THAN AT TEN THIRTEP P M IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MY BRAIN JUST AS WELL I'VE GOT A PROGRAMM AND I'M JUST GOING TO RUN THE PROGRAMM AND THE WAY THE PROGRAMM RUNS IS THAT WE ALWAYS START WITH FIRST COUPLE OF HOURS OF DEEP SLEEP SO WE JUST GOT A BEGIN AT NUMBER ONE SEEN ONE IT DOESN'T DO THAT NOW I WILL GET SOME DEEP SLEEP TO BEGIN WITH AND PART OF THAT IS JUST BECAUSE OF HOW SLEEP WORKS BASED ON HOW LONG I'VE BEEN AWAKE LONGER I'M AWAKE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATE A PRESSURE FOR DEEP SLEEP BUT WE ACTUALLY USE EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED AS AN EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQU TO SELECTIVELY DEPRIVE PEEPLE OF ONE OF THOSE STAGES OF SLEEP OR THE OTHER SO WE WILL DO FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT DEPRIVATION AND THEN LET YOU SLEEP THE SECOND HALF SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU WILL BE MOST SLEEP DEEP SLEEP DEPRIVED AND YOU WILL STILL GET MOST SLEEP ALL OF YOUR REM SLEEP AND THEN WE SWITCH IT SO YOU ONLY GET YOUR FIRST FOUR HOURS WHICH MEANS YOU WILL MOSTLY GET DEEP NON REM SLEEP BUT YOU WILL GET ALMOST NO REM SLEEP SO IN BOTH OF THOSE GROUPS THEY'VE BOTH HAD FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN TERMES OF AN EXPERIMENTAL OUTCOME IS NOT THE SLEEP TIME BECAUSE THEY'VE BOTH SLEPT FOR THE SAME AMOUNT IT'S THE CONTRIBUTION OF THOSE DIFFERENT STAGES NOW WE ACTUALY HAVE MORE ELEGANT METHODS FOR SOT OF SELECTIVELY GOING IN THERE AND SCOOPING OUT DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEEP BUT THAT'S THE WAY WE USED TO DO AT OLD SCHOOL WAS JUST USING THIS TIMING DIFFERENCE AND WHO SUFFERS MORE O THOSE THAT LACK THE EARLY PHASE OWD WERE THOSE THAT LACK THE LATER PHAYSE OF THE NIGHT SLEEP IN OTHER WORDS IF I HAVE TO SLEEP ONLY FOUR HOURS FOR WHATEVER REASON ON MY BETTER OFF GETTING THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT SLEEP OR THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHTS DEPENDS ON WHAT THE OUT COM MEASURE IS IM SO THAT GETS RIGHT TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SLOWWAVE SLEEP AND REM RAY I I WAS A PROBABLY MISINFORMD BUT MY UNDERSTANDING A VERY TRUDE UNDERSTANDING I SHOULD I SHOULD SAY BEFORE I I MUCH DA  OLS CONTRA WIT SOME OS AT YOU HOW WICH IS THAT THER VERY AS OF YOU BUT THAT THE THE FIRST PART OF THE NIGHT THE SLOWAVE SLEEP IS RESTORATIVE TO THE MUSCULATURE TO MOTOR LEARNING AND THAT THE DREAM CONTENT ENTS TO BE LESS EMOTIONAL THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT BE MORE EMOTIONAL DREAMS AND SORT OF THE UNPARRING OF THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF OUR PREVIOUS DAY AND OTHER EXPERIENCES SO ANOTHER WORDS IF I WERE TO DEPREME MYSELF DEPRIVE MYSELF CUSE ME OF REM I WOULD BE HIPEREMOTION ALL NIGHT MAYBE NIGHT AS SETTLED WITH  THE KIND OF EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE WHEREAS OFBO DEID MYSELF OF SLOWAVE SLEEP I WOULD I'M FEEL OF O MORE PHYSICAL MALAYS S THAT CORRECTOR IS THAT FAR TO SAND WON AND IF IT IS TOO SIMPLE PLEASE I TELL ME WHERE I'M WRONG NO I THINK MUCH OF THAT IS  CORRECT AND IT'S SIT OF THAT PLUS SO FOR EXAMPLE DURING DEEP NONREM SLEEP THAT'S WHERE WE GET THIS IT'S ALMOST A FORM OF NATURAL BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION AND SO WHEN I TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU THE NEXT DAY WERE USUALLY GOING TO SEE AUTONOMIC DISFUNCTION WERE USUALY GOING TO SEE ABNORMALITIES AND HEARTRATE BLOOD PRESSURE WE ALSO KNOW THAT DURING DEEP NONREM SLEEP THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN CONTROL OF SPECIFIC HORMONES FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT THE INSOLEN REGULATION OF SORT OF METABOLISM A MEANING HOW WILL YOU LUCK FROM A REGULATED BLOOD SHOOK A PERSPECTIVE VERSIS DISREGULATED PREDIABETIC LUCK OF PROFILE THAT'S WHERE DEEP SLEEP SEEMSTEMATIV WE SELECTIVELY DEPRIVE YOU OF THAT E GLOSEG ON HIM GROWTH FORMERS DIFFERENT ATCULLY SO THAT'S THAT'S A BEAUSIFUL DEMONSTRATION WERE GROWTH HORMON SEEMS TO BE MORE REMSLEEP DEPENDENT AND THAT'S WHY WE CAN COME ON TO THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL IN THES THE SOMREALLY IMPRESSIVE FRIGHTENING DATURON ON ALCOHOL IN ITS DISRUPTION OF AM OF SLEEP BUT THEN WE ALSO KNOW TESTOSTEROM PIQUE LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE HAPPENED DURING REMSLEEP THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT IT AS SAI A SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT SO IT REALLY JUST MEANS THAT THE YOUR PROFILE OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISFUNCTION WE'LL BE DIFFERENT UNDER BOTH OF THOSE CONDITIONS WHICH ONE WOULD YOU PREFER I WOULD PREFER NEITHER OF THEM AND IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR TRYING TO OPTOMISE FOR SO IT'S IT'S JUST SO COMPLECENT OF SLEEP IS JUST SO PLORI POTENT YOU KNOW IT'S SO PHYSIOLOGICALLY SYSTEMIC THAT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO UNDERGO ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS JUST DEEP SLEEP DEPROVATION OR JUST REM SLEEP DEPROVATION AND NOT SHOW A PROFILE THAT YOU WOULD REALLY PREFER TO AVOID AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE REASON FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY STANDPOINT THAT WEAVE PRESERVE THOSE STAGES OF SLEEP I MEAN SLEEP IS JUST SO IDIOTIC YOU KNOW FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE OR MAYBE WAKING AS IT EAN OL WAIT E HERS  YOU KNOW I E YE I TE ON YOUR PREVII DLI TALKING TOA COME IN IS VERY PACIFIC TO ME I YET I AM NORMALLY I'VE ALWAYS IN IDIOT WHEM WAKING BUT I THINK THIS THIS IDEA THAT SLEEP YOU KNOW IS SO PROFOUNDLY DEBT TRO MENTAL TO US IF YOU TO TAKE IT AT FACE VALUE YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT FINDING A MATE YOU'RE NOT RE PRODUCING YOU'RENOT FORAGING FOR FOOD YOUE NOT CARING FOR YOU YOUNG AND WORST OF ALL YOU'VE FUNDERABLE TEPREDATION ON ANY ONE OF THOSE GROUNDS SLEEP PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED AGAINST BUT IT WASN'T SLEEP HAS FOGT ITS WAY THROUGH HEROICALLY EVERY STEP ALONG THE EVOLUTIONARY PATH AND THER FOR EVERY SLEEP STAGE HAS ALSO SURFIVE JUST BEST WE CAN TELL WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THOSE ARE NON NEGOTIABLE IF MOTHER NATURE HAD FOUND AWAY TO EVEN JUST SET OF YOU KNOW THIN SLY SOME OF THAT SLEEP FROM US THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FAST I'M SURE EVOLUTIONARY BENEFITS BUT LOOKS AST THOUGH SHE HASN'T AND I'M USUALLY IN FAVOR OF HER WISDOM AFTER THREE POINT SIX MILLION YEARS SO TAT'S IT'S INCREDIBLE I WANT  I INTRODUCA ANOTHER A GODONKAN EX PROM ANOTHER THOUGHT EXPERIMENT SO IN THIS ART OF THE NIGHT I SLOWAYS SLEEP PREDOMINATES EARLY IN THE NIGHT AND THEN REM SLEEP THERE'S A SANAREO THAT MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF EXPERIENCE ON A REGULAR BASIS WHICH IS THEY GO TO SLEEP SEEMING JUST FINE THREE FOUR HOURS INTIT THEY WAKE UP THEY WAKE UP FOR WHATEVER REASON MAB THERE 'S A NOISE MAY BE THE TEMPERATURE ISN'T RIGHT WE WILL CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT SLEEP HYGENE ET CETERA THEY GET UP THEY GO TO THE RESTROM THEY MIGHT FLIP ON THE NIGHTS THEY MIGHT NOT THEY'LL GET BACK IN BED HOPEFULLY THEY'RE NOT PICKING UP THEIR PHONE AND STRARTIN TO ROUSE AND WAKE UP THE BRAIN THROUGH VARIOUS MECHANISMS LIGHT AN COGNIME STIMULATION ET CETERA THEY GO BACK TO SLEEP LET'S SAY AFTER ABOUT TEN FIFTY MENTES THEY'RE ABLE TO FALL BACK A SLEEP THEN THEY SLEEP TILL THEIR MORE TYPICAL WATE TIME E HOW DETRIMENTAL IS THAT WAKE UP EPISODE OR OR IM EVENT IN TERMS OF LONGEVITY LEARNING ET CETERA I WOULD LOVE TO SLEEP THE ENTIRE NIGHT THROUGH EVERY NIGHT BUT MOST NIGHTS I DON'T AND YET I FEEL PRETTY GOOD THROUGHOUT THE DAY SOME DAYS BETTER THAN OTHERS E SO IF YOU WERE TO AT AVE A VALUE ATE THAT WAKING API SOD IN COMPARE IT TO SLEEPING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH WHAT ARE YOUR WERE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT SO I THINK IF YOU'RE WAKING UP SO FREQUENTLY AS YOUR DESCRIBING I WOULD PROBABLY GET YOUR ESTATE IN ORDER BECAUSE MY GUESS IS WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR BER GIN TO BE YOU CAN TO BE DONE FOR NO I'M KITTING ABSOLUTELY KITTING YOU IT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL AN NORMAL PARTICULARLY AS WE PROGRESS WITH AGE YOUR CHILDREN TEND TO HAVE I'M TYPICALLY MORE CONTINUOUS SLEEP NOW IT'S NOT THAT THEY AUN'T WAKING UP FOR BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME THEY ARE AND IN FACT WE ALL DO WHEN WE COME OUT THE OTHER END OF OUR SLEEP CYCL AT THE END OF OUR REM SLEEP PERIOD OF THE NINTY MINUTE CYCLE ALMOST EVERY B DY WAKES UP AND WE MAKE A POSTURAL MOVEMENT WE TURN OVER BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN PARALYZE FOR SO LONG AND THE BODY WILL ALSO LIKE TO SHIFT IF WE ARE A LOOK AROUND WE RE OPEN OUR RS POSITION YOU SOMESOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL OPEN THEIR EYES BUT USUALLY IT'S ONLY FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY USUALLY NEVER COMMIT THOSE AWAKENINGS TO MEMORY YOU'R SITUATION AND IT'S MY SITUATION AS WELL I USUALLY NOW AT THE SAGE OF LIFE I DON'T SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT I'LL USUALLY HAVE A BATHROOM A BREAK AND HEN I'LL COME BACK THAT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL WE TEND TO FORGET THAT IN SLEEP SCIENCE WE THINK OF SLEEP EFFICIENCY SO OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU'RE IN BED HOW MUCH OF THAT PER CENT TIME IS SPENT ASLEEP AND WE USUALLY LOOK TWO NUMBERS THAT ARE ABOVE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OR MORE AS A HEALTHY SLEEP EFFICIENCY SO IF YOU TO THINK ABOW ME GOING TO BED AND I SPEND YOU KNOW LET'S SAY EIGHT AND A QUARTET EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS OF TIME IN BED WITH A NORMAL HEALTHY SLEP EFFICIENCY I STILL MAY BE ONLY SLEEPING A TOTAL OF SEVEN AND A HALF HOURS OR SEVEN AND THREE QUARTER HOURS MEANING THAT I'M GOING TO BE AWAKE IN TOTAL NOT IN ONE LONG BOD BUT I'M GOING TO BE AWAKE FOR UPWARDS OF THIRTY MINUTES NAT SOME TIME SOME TIMES THAT CAN BE AFTER A TEN MINUTE YOU KNOW DALLIANTS AFTER HAVING GONE TO THE BATH ROOM AND I'M JUST GRADUALLY DRIFTING BACK OFF AGAIN OR THE TIMES IT WILL JUST BE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND MOST OF THOSE YOU DON'T COMMITE SO I THINK WE NEED TO STOP WE DON'T NEED TO GET TOO WORRIED ABOWT YOU KNW PERIODS OF TIME AWAKE JUST BECAUSE WHENE NOT SLEEPING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT TON I REMEMBER WHEN I THAT USED TO HAPPEN IN IT STILL HAPPENS YOUEVERYAT OLY YOUR GREAT MD AD OT  IT'S LOVELY THINGS TAS SURPRISE RIGHT AND YOT NOT GO NOW A LRISE THE HALL NIGHT YONER IT IS A SURPRISER BUT FOR THE MOST PART I THINK WE CAN BE MORE RELAXED ABOUT THAT WHERE WE HAVE TO BE A BIT MORE ATTENTIVE THO IS IF YOU ARE SPENDING LONG PERIODS OF TIME NOT BEING ABLE TO GET BACK TO SLEEP AND USUALLY WE TY FINE THAT BY SAYING IF IT'S BEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES NORMALLY THAT'S A TIME WHEN WE WULD REALLY SAY I'LL GAY LET LET'S EXPLORE THIS WHAT'S GOING ON LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING THE OTHER THING IS IF IT'S HAPPENING VERY FREQUENTLY SO EVEN IF YOU'RE AM YOU KNOW NOT AWAKE FOR TWENTY FIVE MINUTES STRETCHES BUT YOU'R FINDING YOURSELF WAKING UP AND BEING CONSCIOUSLY AWERE THAT YOU'VE WOKEN UP FOR MAY BE SIX SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND YOU'R SLEEP IS VERY WHAT WE CALL FRAGMENTED THE GREAT SCIENCE OF SLEEP IN THE PAST FIVE OR TEN YEARS HAS HAS BEEN YES QUANTITY IS IMPORTANT BUT QUALITY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AND YOU CAN'T HA AVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER IN TIMES OF A GOOD BENEFICIAL NEXT DAY OUT COME YOU CAN'T JUST GET FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP BUT BRILLIANT QUALITY OF SLEEP AND BE UNIMPAT NOR CAN YOU GET EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP BUT HAVE VERY POOL QUALITY OF SLEEP AND BE UNIMPAT THE NEXT DAY SO THAT'S WHY I JUST SOT OF ONE TO ASTERIS THIS IDEA OF LET'S NOT GET TOO WORRIED ABOUT WAKING UP AND HAVING SOME TIME AWAKE THAT'S TERFECTLY NORMAL AND NATURAL BUT IF IT'S HAPPENING VERY FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT ALL THOSE PERIODS OF TME A LONG STRETCHES OF TIME UPWARDS OF TWENTY FIVE MINUTES THEN LET'S LOOK INTO IT I CAN ASSURE YOU JUST UM HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THIS WAKING UP EPISODE THAT I AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENTES I I AM SO BECAUSE I CAUSE I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE YOU KNOW I THINK I'VE BEEN DESPERATELY GUILTY OF PERHAPS YOU KNOW ALYON BEING TOO PURITANICAL ABOUT YOU KNOW SLEEP AND AAND I'VE I'VE RETROSPECTED AND I'VE TRIED TO EXPLORE WHY THIS WAS THE CASE YOU KNO IT WAS ALMOST SLEEP OR ELSE DOT DOT DOT AND AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS STUCTING TO WRITE THE BOOK WHICH WAS BACK IN TOO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN YOU SLEEP WAS STILL A NEGLECTED STEP SISTER IN THE HEALTH CONVERSATION OF TO DAY AND I CL DESICERN OLD GAN THE AND IT'S CHANGING YOU KNOW AND NOT BECAUSE IT TO MY EFFITS Y I WILL SAY HOLLY I WILL SAY WELL I IT'S A GREAT UM THAT YOU GIVE AN ATTRIBUTION TO YOUR THET OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED IN OF COURSE IT'S A BIG FIELD BUT I THINK UM YOU'VE DONE A GREAT SERVICE BY CUING PEOPLE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS STATE NOT JUST FOR AVOIDING TROUBLESOME OUT COMES BUT ALSO FOR OPTIMIZING THEIR WAKING STATE IT'S REALLY YOU KNOW I I VEW SLEEP AS THIS HERE THAT FEELS GOOD BUT WERE NOT AWARE OF HOW IT FEELS WHEN WE'RE IN IT NECESSARILY YE IM HAS TREMENOUS BENEFITS WHEN YOU'R DOING IT WELL SO TO SPEAK AND HAS TREMENDOUS UM DEPHISITS WHEN WHEN WERE NOT AND I THINK I THINK IT WAS AN IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU TO DO TO CU PEOPLE TO THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD SAY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE NEED FOR SLEEP I THINK THAT KNOWING THAT WAKING UP IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT IS NORMAL PROVIDED T'S NOT TOO FREQUENT IS IS GREAT AND WILL ALSO HELP PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I I DO ONE USEIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY RAISE SOMETHING ABOUT THE SO CALLED UBERMEN SCADUL NOT HAVE YU ANIFYOUNET WITH TE HUBERMAN AS CADL IM FORTUNATELY KNOWIN I HAS CONFUSED THOSE YET IM SOME YEARS AGO THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SO CALLED UBERMEN SCDUL MEANING THE SUPERMAN SCHADUL SO THAT HUBERMEN WITHOUT AN ACH WHICH I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH UM YO READ YOUR NICI THIS W THIS WILL HAVE A SUBTEXT BUT REGARDLESS M THE UBERMENSCADULE AS I UNDERSTAND IS ONE IN WHICH UM THE PERSON ELACS TO SLEEP IN NINETY MEN IT BOUTS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NIGHT IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET MORE PRODUCTIVITY AM IND OR REDUCE THEY'RE OVER ALL SLEEP NEED THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISH RECENTLY THAT EXPLORED WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS GOOD OR BAD FOR US MAYBOU JUST IT GIVE US THE TACO MESSAGE ON THAT YES OF THESE UPEMEN LIKE A SHEDUELS AND THES LOTS OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF THAT THEY TRIE TO ESSENTIALLY PI CHOT THE TWENTY FOR OUR PERIOD INTO SHORT BOUTS OF SLEEP WITH SOME SHORT O OR NO WELL SLIGHTLY LONGER PERIODS OVE WAKEFULNESS THAN SHORT BOUTS OF SLEEP THAN WAKEFULNESS YOU KNOW YOU'R I SAID HAVE MADE I THINK EQUIP IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOUR SLEEPING LIKE A BABY IN CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THAT ABE NIGHET IN NINETY MIN LL TIPES THAT THEY 'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THESE BRIEF NAPS THEN THER'RE AWAKE THEN THER'RE A SLEEP THEN THERE WAKE AND TO THE CHIGRIN OF PARENTS ACROSS THE NIGHT IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THER'RE AWAKE THEY'RE SLEEP THEY'RE AWAKE TO SLEEP AND THAT'S MORE THE THE CHEDUEL THAT THESE TYPES OF PROTOCALS AVE I HAVE SUGGESTED AND THERE WAS A REALY GREAT COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW THAT FOUND NOT ONLY THAT THEY WENT NECESSARILY HELPFUL BUT THEY WERE ACTUALLY RALY QUITE DETRIMENTAL ANDON ALMOST EVERY PERFORMANCE MET TRICK WHETHER IT BE TASK PERFORMANCE WHETHER IT BE PHYSIOLOGICAL OUT COME MEASURES WHETHER IT EVEN BE THE QUALITY OF THE SLEEP THAT THEY WERE HAVING WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO GET IT ALL OF THOSE WERE IN A DANWID DIRECTION AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING IF YOU LOOK AT YOU'R THE WAY THAT YOUR PHYSIOLOGY IS PROGRAMMED IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY YOUR CICADIAN RHYTHM IS PROGRAMMED NONE OF THAT SCREAMS TO US THAT WEP SHOULD BE SLEEPING IN THAT WAY WHY CHUCKLING BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HERE SLEEP LIKE A BABY THIS IS OUR BABYS SLEEP AND A I WOULD SAY DON'T SLEEP LIKE A BABYS SLEEP LIKE AN ADULT BE I MEANS TE GET GET YOUR SOLAT EIGHT HOURS TO THE A CRYSTALS LINE WHOSA A YOU KNOW A LONG STANDING SUFFERING A IN SOMENY ACUSESS I SLEEP LIKE A BABY AM AWAKE EVERY TWENTY MINUTES YOU KNOW AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WHEN YOU FIGHT BIOLOGY YOU NORMALLY LOSE AND THE WAY YOU KNOW YOU'VE LOST IS DISEASE SICKNESS AND IMPEIMENT AND I THINK IF YOU SLEEP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATURAL BIOLOGICAL EDICT THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN GIVEN LIFE TENDS TO BE BOTH OF A HIER QUALITY AND ALONG A DURATION I AGREE ALONG THOSE LINES AM IM AS A VISION SCIENTISTS I'VE BEEN VERY EXCITED BY THE WORK ON THESE ANON IMAGE FORMING CELLS IN THE EYE THE SO CALL MOLONOPS AND CELLS THAT AN N THE BRAIN ABOUT TIE CIRCADIAN TIME OF DAY AND I'M A BIG PROPONING OF PEOPLE GETTING A SOME SUNLIGHT IDEALLY SUNLIGHT BUT OTHER FORMS OF BRIGHT LIGHT IN THEIR EYES EARLY IN THE DAY AND WHEN THEY WANT TO BE AWAKE YOU ESSENTIALY DURING THE PHASE OF THEIR TWENTY FOUR HOUR CIRCADIAN CYCHAEL WHEN TEMPERATURE IS RISING AND THEN STARTING N GET LESS LIGHT IN THEIR EYES AS OUR TEMPERATURES GOING DOWN AND TURM IT LATER IN THE DAY AND IN THE EVENING ARE THERE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT GENERAL THEME THAT YOU LIKE TO ADD OR IS A IN ANYWAY NOW I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WA WE RECOMMEND RIGHT NOW WHICH IS TRY TO GET AT LEAST THIRTY TO FORTY MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TO SOME KIND OF NATURAL DAYLIGHT NOW THERE MAY BE PARTS OF THE WORLD WERE YOU KNOW IT IS FROM YOURE FROM A A RATHER CLOUDY PART OF I AM FROM YE A LIVERPOOL ENGLAND A AND A THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND IS NOT KNOWN FOR ITS A BEACH RESULTS AND FINE WEATHER A I REMEMBER I'D SO I WENT BACK HOME FOR TRIP WHEN I'D FIRST BEEN OUTS AIN CALIFORNIA I THOUGHT WHY IS THE SKY SO LOW IT'S JUST THEN O CONSTANTLY A WE JOKE THAT IN AN IN THE YOU CA WE USUALLY HAVE NINE MONTHS OF BAD WEATHER AND THEN THREE MONTHS OF WINTER AND THAT THAT'S YOUR THAT'S YOU'RE ENTIRE YEAR OF INTEMTS OF A CLIMATE BUT TO COME TO YOUR POINT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT TRY TO GET THAT DAYLIGHT NOW IT CAN BE YOU KNOW WORKING NEXT TO A WINDOW AND YOU'L GETTING THAT NATURAL SUNLIGHT BUT THAT NATURAL SUNLIGHT IS EVEN ON A CLOUDY DAY IN ENGLAND IS USUALLY FAR MORE POTENT THAN ANYTHING THAT YOU'LL GET FROM INDOOR LIGHTING DESPITE YOU THINKING SO FROM A PERCEPTION WISE MAYBE THE THAT MUCH CLOSER THAN I WOULD THING Y I'VE BEEN AM START INTERRUPT I'VE BEEN N A BIG ONE OF THERE'S A AN AP CALLED LIGHT METER WHICH WELL IT'S A FREE AP I'VE NOTHIN TO DO WITH IT THEY'LL ALLOW YOU TO AGET A PRETTY DECENT MEASUREMENT OF THE AMOUNT OF A LIGHT ENERGY COMING TOWARD YOU AND IF YO AM HOLD IT UP TO A CLOUDY MORNING WHERE YOU DON'T THINK IT'S VERY BRIGHT OUTKIND OF A DISMAL DAY YOU' NOTICE THAT THEY'LL BE A THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND EVEN HE OR FIVE THOUSAND LOOKS LOCKS JUST BEING A MEASURE OF BRIGHTNESS OF COURSE AND THEN YOU CAN POINT THE SAME LIGKT MEET RETOWARD AN INDOOR LIGHT THAT SEEMS VERY BRIGHT AND VERY INTENSE AND IT'LL SAY FIVE HUNDRED LANS AND YOU REALIZE THAT THE INTENSITY AS WE GAUGE IT PERCEPTIONALLY IS NOT REALLY WHAT THES SYSTEM IS RECEIVING SO OUTDOOR LIGHT EST KEY HOW DO YOU WHOW DO YOU GET THIS NATURAL STIMULATION OR AM I SHOULD O SAY LIGHT STIMULATION EARLY IN THE DAY WHAT IS YOUR TYPICAL WHAT'S MAT WALKER DO TA THIS AT'S AN ANLY I AM NO POST E CHILD BUT AM USUALLY I WILL AN IF I'M WORKING I USUALY WORK OUT MOST DAYS AM AND I SHOPPED AROUND WAND I FOUND O JIM THAT HAS HUGE AMOUNTS OF WINDOW EXPOSURE FACING TO THE EAST THIS IS SOUND THIS CAN A SOUND SO AT RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW THAT WORK IT CHOUSES A JIM ON THE BASIS A LOVIT THE SOLA IMPUT SO HE CAN WROT YOU KNOW THER A LOT OR IT TOIS IS  LI IN JIMS THIS ONE IS ROUNDED IN PHYSIOLOGY AN BIOLOGY AND SO AND SELFISHNESS ABOUT MY OWN SLEEP US A SOYO SO YOU GET YOUR EXERCISE AND YOUR LIGHT STIMULATION SAS RAINS YE YE AND SOR STACKING CUSE FOR WAKEFULNESS EARLY IN THE EXACTLY SO BOTH EXERCISE AND DAYLIGHT ARE WONDERFUL CUESE FOR SECATIN RHYTHM A LINEMEANT AN ALSO SECATIAN RHYTHM RESET EACH DAY AND SO I WILL USE BOTH EXERCISE I MEAN I AM I'M NEITHER A STRONG MORNING TYPE OR ASTRONG EVENING TYPE AND MY PREFERENCE TO EXERCISE IS PROBABLY SOME TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY I'M PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ROUND ONE I ONE P MSARY NOT ONE AM I'M BUT I'M USUALLY WORKING OUT PROBABLY AROUND THE SAID OF SEVEN SAID OF FORTY FIVE EIGHT I A M TIME THAT'S USULLY WHEN I'LL START MY WORK OUT AND THERE I START WITH CARDIO SPEND BY FACING A WINDOW AND LUCKILY FOR THE MOST PART HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S USUALLY SUNLIGHT COMING THROUGH BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME BECAUST JUST AS YOU CAD EVEN WHEN IT'S A CLOUDY DAY THAT LUCK'S COMING THROUGH OF LIGHT THERE THE THE INTENSITY IS IS SPLENDID SO I WOULD PREFER TO FAVOR MI EXERCISE JUST BECAUSE FOR EFFICIENCY TOO I ONE GET ALSO WORKING ON THE DAY I'M I'LL TRY TO MATCH MI EXERCISE MORE WITH MY CICADIAN LIGHT EXPOSURE THAN I WELD PROBABLY IF I'M GOING TO DO I REALLY ON A CRESSURE WORK OUT OR DO I WANTO JUST YOU KOW MAKURE IT'S A GOOD WORK OUT I WOULD PREFER TO WORK OUT YOU KNOW AT A DIFFERENT TIME BUT I LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF THE DAYLIGHT AND WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT EXERCISE TIMING AT SOME POINT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THAT HEN IS THE RIGHT EXERTIME TO EXERCISE DURING SLEEP AND WE CAN SAID BUSTSOM METHS THER TOO I'M SO I THINK YOUR SPOT ON WITH THE SUGGESTION GET SOME MORNING DAYLIGHT TRY TO GET THAT EXPOSURE USUALLY AT LEAST THIRTY TO FORTY MINUTES THERE WAS SOME GREAT WORK RECENTLY COMING OUT IN THE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH DOMAIN WHERE THEY MOVED WORKERS FROM OFFICIES THAT WERE JUST FACING WALLS AND YOU KNOW DIDN'T HAVE ANY EXPOSURE TO NATURAL DAYLIGHT AND THEN THEY DID A TIME PERIOD DURING THAT STUDY WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WERE IN FRONT OF A WINDOW AND WORKING AND THEY MEASURED THEIR SLEEP AND THERE SLEEP TIME AND THERE SLEEP EFFICIENCY INCREASE QUITE DRAMATICALLY I'M FORGETTING THE NUMBERS NOW BUT I THINK THE INCREASE IN TOTAL SLEEP TIME WAS WELL OVER THIRTY MINUTES AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP EFFICIENCY WAS FIVE TO TEN PER CENT YOU KNOW AND IF YOURE BATTING IN EIGHTY PERCEND YOU KNOW SLEEP EFFICIENCY AVERAGE WERE A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BUT AT TEM PER CENT TO THAT AN NOW YOU'RE IN YOU KNOW GREAT ESHALON OF HEALTHY SLEEPERS AND ALL YOU DID WAS JUST SPEND SOME TIME WORKING IN FRONT OF WINDOWS THAT'S GREAYE AND PROBALY UM FOLKS MY ONE I CONSIDER SPENDING L LAST TIME AS SON GLASSES PROVIDED THEY CAN DO THAT SAFEFLY YOU'N YOU'RE DRIVING ET CETERA YOU'RE NOT ALONE WITH YOUR EXERCISE BEHAVIOUR IN FACING E SO UM THE ONE AND ONLY TEN PARIS TOLD ME RECENTLY THAT HIS MORNING ROUTINE NOWADAYS CONSISTS OF JUMPING ROPE WHILE FACING EAST TO GET THE SUNLIGHT STIMULATION OF OF THE GEYES AND UM AS A MAT NI BOTH NO IT HAS TO BE OF THE EYES RI ON YO TES PORITALS A THE ONLY WAYDUS TO UM CONVEYD OF THE REST OF THE BRAIN AN BODY ABOUT THE TIME OF DAY AND WAKEFULNESS UM ALONG THE LINES OF WAKEFULNESS A'VE ANOM ERE QUESTIONS ABOUT KAFFINE YE THE DREADED AND BELOVED KAFINEI LOVE KAFFI BUT I LIKE IT IN RELATIVELY A RESTRICTED PERIODS OF TIME SO UM I'M A BIG FAN OF WAKING UP AND EVEN THOUGH I WAKE UP VERY GROGGY ALLOWING MY NATURAL WAKEFULNESS SIGNALS TO TAKE HOLD MEANING I WAKE A VERY SLOWLY BUT I DON'T DRINK KAFFINE RIGHT AWAY IBSERVE DELAY KAFFINE WHILE A LITTLE WHILE USUALLY NINETY MINUTES TO TWO HOURS AND THAT IDEA CAME TO ME ON THE BASIS OF MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW KAFFINE IN THE A DENISINE RECEPTOR INTERACT I'VE A FEELING YOURE CAN PRONOUNCE A DENISINE DIFFERENTLY THAN I DON'T NO ILL AO GOI THE INISI'L I'LL TRY TO GO WITH YOUR SKILETAL INSER OF SKELETOL AN ASA SENAANSIN AS SET YOUON TAAT YOUL NER YA BUT UM BUT TO MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE FOR VOKS HOW DOES KAFFINE WORK TO MAKE US FEEL MORE ALERT AND DOES THE TIMING IN WHICH WE INGEST KAFFINE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN WEATHER OR NOT IT WORKS FOR US OR AGAINST US SO MAY WE JUST START WITH HOW DOES KAFFINE WORK WHY IS IT THAT WHEN I DRINK MATE OR COFFEE WHICH ARE MY PREFERRED SOURCES OF KAFFINE DO I FEEL A MENTAL AND PHYSICAL LIFT YE SO I'M GOING TO SUGGEST COUNT TO WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK DRINK COFFEE WE'LL NOT  IS MY TAALL YAER AN WHATEVER FORM YOU WELLING WILL WILL COME ON TOS AT O WHY I SUGGEST THAT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO COFFEE I WOULD SAY THE DOSE AND THE TIMING MAKES THE POISON SO THAT START WITH HOW KAFFINE WORKS I'M CAFFINE IS IN A CLASSOF TROKES THAT WE CALL THE PSYCHO ACTIVE STIMULANTS SO IT WORKS THROUGH A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS I'M ONE IS A DOPAMINE MECHANISM DOPEN WE WE OFTEN THINK OF AS A REWARD CHEMICAL OR IM BUT DOPAMINE IS ALSO VERY MUCH IN ALERTING YOU'RE A CHEMICAL AS WELL KAFFINE HAS SOME ROLE IT SEEMS TO PLAY IN INCREASING DOPEMEE BUT IT'S PRINCIPAL MODE OF ACTION WE BELIEVE IN TIMES OF MAKING ME MORE AL LET AND KEEPING ME AWAKE THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS ON THE EFFECTS OF A DENIINE AND TO EXPLAIN WHAT A DENISINE IS FROM THE MOMENT THAT YOU AND I WOKE UP THIS MORNING THIS CHEMICAL A DENISINE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP IN OUR BRAIN AND THE LONGER THAT WERE AWAKE THE MORE OF THAT A DENISINE ACCUMULATES IS IT UM MAY ASK IS IT ACCUMULATING IN NURONS IN GLEA OR IN THE BLOOD VESSELS WHERE AN END IS IT ALSO ACCUMULATING IN MY BODY WHERE IS THIS A DENISINE COMING FROM AND WEARS IT ACCUMULATID YES SO THE ADENISINE HERE THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS CREATING THE SLEEP PRESSIA IS A CENTRAL BRAIN PHENOMENON AND IT COMES FROM THE NURONS THEMSELVES COMBUSTING ENERGY AND AS THE COMBUSTING ENEGY ONE OF THE OFF SHOO TS OF THAT IS THIS CHEMICAL A DENISENE CA AND SO AS WE'RE AWAKE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND OUR BRAIN IS METOBOLICALY VERY ACTIVE IT'S ACCUMULATING IN BUILDING UP THIS A DENISENE NOW THE THE MORE ADENISEENE THAT WE HAVE THE SLEEPIA THAT WE WILL FEEL SO IT REALLY IS LIKE SLEEP PRESSURE IS WHAT WE CALL IT THATIT'S NOT A MECHENICAL PRESSURE DON'T WORRY YOU HEAD'S NOT GANO EXPLAIN IT'S A CHEMICAL PRESSU AND IT'S THIS WAIGHT OF SLEEPINESS THAT WE FEEL GRADUALLY GROWING AS WE GET INTO THE EVENING MAY AMA JUST INGI AGAIN TO JUST ASK A DO WE KNOW WHAT THE CIRCUIT MECHANISM IS FOR THAT I'M NOT TO AM GO TOO FAR DOWN THE RABBIT HOLL BUT FOR THE EVISNATOS AND FOR MYSELF  WE HAVE BRAIN MECHANISMS LIKE LOCUSERULIASIRE RELEASE THINGS THAT ER BRAIN AREAS LOXTRIL IS JUST BEING A BRAIN AIR OF COURSE THAT RELEASE THINGS THAT CREAT THAT PROACTIVELY CREATE WAKEFULNESS YE SO ARE THOSE NERE ON SHUTTING DOWN AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING TOO MUCH A DENSINE ER ARE THEIR AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT PROMOTE SLEEPINESS THAT ARE AND A ACTIVATED BECAUSE HE'S Y IMAGINE BOTH THINGS WORKING IN PARALLEL YE ON OR THE OTHER WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE SAME ANPOINT AND IT'S IT'S BOTH AND SO THERE ARE TWO MAIN RECEPTORS FOR A DENISCENE THE A ONE RECEPTA AND THE A TO RECEPTA AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACTIVATING BRAIN CELLS OR INACTIVATING OR DECREASING THE LIKELIHOD OF FIRING AN A DENISINE WORKS IN THIS BEAUTIFUL ELEGANT WAY WHERE IT WILL INHIBOT AND SHUT DOWN THE WAKE PROMOTING AREAS OF THE BRAIN WHILST ALSO INCREASING IN DILING UP THE VOLUME ON SLEEP ACTIVATING SLEEP MY ALMOSTING AGREES AH IT'S ALWAYS A PIGICAL YE I MAN WE AND WE COULD HAVE A LARGER DISCUSSION AT SOME POINT ABOUT THAT A EVERYTHING SEEING DARK EDGES SEENG LIGHT EDGES A YR ABILITY TO TO SMELL OR TO SENSE PRESSURE ON THIS IS EVERYTHING'S A PUSH OD'S BRAT YAYA SO THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE AS I MAWAKE LONGER A DENIINE IS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AN MY WAKEFULNESS AREAS ARE BEING ACTIVELY SHUT DOWN BY THAT A DENISENE AND MY SLEEPINESS BRAIN AREA SO TO SPEAK ARE BEING PROMOTED TO BE MORE ACTIVE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S RIGHT AND IT'S A VERY PROGRESSIVE PROCESS IT'S NOT LIKE A STEP FUNCTION WA AND SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS OCCASIONALLY BUT IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEINGSTEAD OF DRIVING THROUGH AND AS WILL COME ON TO HAVE CAFIN IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN ALL OF A CERTAIN YOU JUST HIT A WOOL AND IT JUST YOU KNOW ENGULFS YOU AND YOU GO FROM A ZERO TO THE ONE OF SLEEPINESS WITHIN A SHORT PURED TIME WHAT ITBLAINS THE FATIGUE AFTER A HARD CONVERSATION THE DESIRE TO GO TO SLEEP OR THE DESIRE TO GO TO SLEEP DURING A HARD CONVERSATION AM THAT'S AN INTERESTING OT I THINK IT'S USUALLY JUST BASED ON PERSONALITY TIVINS DIRECTIONS AND FOR THE MOST PART NOT A I'VE EVER EXERINSA NO WE WITH YOU DON'T BUT WITH ME THEY ONTIN I TE DESIREO TO SOME CONVERSATIONS I'M HALF WAY THROUGH THEM AND I FEEL LIKE O ON A TAKAN AP NEW RIGHT A AND I WOULD LOVE TO LOOK AT YOUKNOW PEOPLE'S SLEEP HISTORY WE'VE SOT OF SEEN THAT TIME TIME AGAIN BUT I'M AND THEN IT COULD BE BEEN WITH WITH FOLKS LIKE ME PEOPLE JUST LOSE THE WILL TO LIVE WITHIN ABOUT FIVE MNA O SPEAKING WITH MES   NOT  TATHINOA SLEEP S INORTAN'T IN TAT OI A NATHING LATTERY THAT'S GREAT BUT SO THE WAY THAT THEN KAFFINE COMES INTO THIS I'M EQUATION AS O SAYING IT'S USUALLY AT THE COUNT OF A LINEA PROCESS OR MAYBE IT'S PROBABY CLOSER TO AN EXPENANTIAL INTERMS OF YOUR SUBJECTIVE FEELING OF SLEEPINESS I'M AND WE HAVEN'T REALDY BEEN ABLE TO MEASURE THAT IN HUMANS BECAUSE NORMALLY WE'VE ITS HARD TO AT SEEP YOU KNOW STICK SOMETHING INTO THE BRAIN AND BE YOU KNOW SUCKING SIFENING OFFSTER FOR EVERY COUPLE OF MINUTES AS YOU COULD DO IN ANIMAL STIDIES AND KEEP ASKING PEOPLE AVERY COUPE OF MINUTES HOW SLEEPY DOYOU FEEL HOW SLEEPY AND TRACTOSE IF THERE'S A LINE ARISE IN YOU KNOW A DENYSINE WHICH THEN CREATES AND EXPENENTIAL RISE IN SUBJECTIVE SLEEPINESS OR WHAT THE DYNAMICS ARE BUT I'M I'M CAN OF NUTTING OUT KAFFINE COMES INTO PLAY HERE BECAUSE KAFFINE COMES INTO YOUR SYSTEM AND IT LATCHES ON TO THOSE WELCOME SIGHTS OF A DENYSINE THE ADENYSINE RECEPTORS BUT WHAT IT DOESN'T DO IS LATCH ON TO THEM AND ACTIVATE THEM BECAUSE IF IT WAS DOING THAT THEN IT WOULD YOU KNOW IN LOTS OF WAYS IT WOULD DIAL UP MORE SOT OF SLEEPINESS IT DOES THE OPPOSITE THE WAY THAT KAFFNE WORKS IS THAT IT COMES IN COMPETES WITH QUITE SHARP ELBOWS WITH A DENASINE COMPETITIVELY FORCES THEM OUT OF THE WAY CI JACKS THAT RECEPTOR BY LACHING ON TO IT BUT THEN JUST ESSENTIALLY BLOCKSIT IT DOESN'T INACTIVATE TE RECEPTOR IT DOESN'T ACTIVATE THE RECEPTOR IT FUNCTIONALLY INACTIVATES IT IN THE SENSE THAT IT TAKES IT OUT OF THE GAME FOR A DENASINE SO IT'S IT'S LIKE SOME ONE YOU KNOW COMING INTO A ROOM AND YOU JUST ABOUT TO SIT DOWN ON THE CHAIR  KAFFIN COMES IN AND JUST PULLS OUT THE CHAIR IN YOU LIKE WELL NOW I'VE GOT NOWHERE TO SET AND KAFFIN JUST KEEPS PULLING OUT THE CHAIRS FROM A DENASENE AND A DENASENE EVEN THOUGH IT'S AT THE SAME CONCENTRATION AN YOUR BRAIN YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR YOU KNOW KAN HOURS SIXTEEN HOURS AT THAT POINT WHEN YOU'VE DOWN A CUP OF COFFEE BECAUSE ALL OF THAT A DENASINE THAT STILL THERE CONT COMMUNICATE TO THE BRAIN THAT YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR SIXTEEN HOURS BUT JUST BUT THE ADENASINE IS STILL AND BRAIN TRASHIT SO IT'S A THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KAFFNE IS DISLODGED FROM THE ADENASNES UNFORTUNATE THINGS HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THE KAFFINE CRASH WHICH IS KAFFINE HAS A HALF LIFE AND ITS METABOLIZED I'M AND CALL WHAT THE HALTH LIFE IS YA THE HALF LIFE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE TO SIX HOURS AND THE QUARTER LIFE THERE FOR IS SOMEWHERE BET ING TEN TO TWELVE HOURS IT'S VARIABLE DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IM DURATIONS OF IT'S ACTION BUT FOR THE AVERAGE DULT FIVE TO SIX HOURS THAT VARIATION WE UNDERSTAND IT'S DOWN TO A LIVER EN TIME OR SET OF LIVERAN TIMES I'M OFF THE CLASS THAT WE CALL THE SIHT TO CRONE PEEP FUR FIFTY ENTIMES AND THERE ARHE I THINK LAST IGHT I DEALTED INTO THE DAT TO WHICH IS PRETTY RECENTLY THERE ARE TOO GENE VARIANCE THAT WILL DICTATE THE ENZIMATIC SPEED WITH WHICH THE LIVA BREAKES DOWN KAFFINE AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAN HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO KAFFINE AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU KNOW I'M JUST DOESN'T AFFECT ME READY THAT MUCH A TWEINGS THAT THE PEOPLE TO HAVE A DOUBLESTPRESSO AFTER A NINE P M DINNER AN YLEEP JUST FINE WELL I'M WE'LL COME ILET OBJECTIVELY THE TINK SOPREJECATIVELY YND WE WE SHOULD SPEAK ABOUT THAT THAT A SUMPTIVE DANGER TOO SO THEN THE KAFFINE IS IN THE SYSTEM I'M AND AFTER SOME TIME PERIOD IT WILL BE INACTIVE IN THE SYSTEM SO LETS SAY THAT YOU KOW I'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR TWELVE HOURS NOW AND IT'S YOU KNOW EIGHT P M AND A FEELING A BIT TIRED BUT I WANT TO PUSHED THROUGH WHEN I WANT TO KEEP WORKING FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS SO I HAVE A CUP OF COFFEI ALL OF THE SUDDEN I WAS FEELING TIRED BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR TWELVE HOURS ANY MORE BECAUSE WITH THE KAFFNE IN THE SYSTEM MAYBE ONLY HALF OF THAT A DENISENE IS BEING COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE RECEPTED TO MY BRAIN HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE DTHE ADENISINE IS STILL THAT ONLY HALF OF IT IS ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE TO MY BRAIN SOM NOW I THINK I HAVEN'T BEEN AWAKE FOR TWELVE HOURS AT JUST BEEN AWAKE FOR SIX HOUS FEEL GREAT THEN AFTER A FEW HOURS AND THE KAFFINE IS STOCTING TO COME OUT OF MY SYSTEM NOT'S ONLY AM I HIT WITH THE SAME LEVELS OF A DENISCENE THAT I HAD BEFORE I'D HAD THE CUP OF COFFEE SEVERAL HOURS AGO IT'S THAT PLUS ALL OF THE ADENICIN THAT'S BEEN BUILDING UP JURING THE TIME THAT THE KAFFINE HAS BEEN IN MY SYSTEM THE SORT OF A AN AVALANCHE OF IT IS SIS AN ARMY WAY Y AND I'VE A KAFFINE CRASH AND HIT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE KAFFINE CRASH AD A TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN YOU HAVE WORKD TO DO IS A TERRIBLE THING BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PERSON MAYBE THIS PERSONN AS ME IN MY CORNINS WHO SAYS I'MNT A DRINK KAFFINE ALL DAY LONG AND THEN I WANT THE CRASH BECAUSE AT NINE OR TEN P M IF I STOPP DRINKING KAFFINE AT SAY SIX P M AND I CRASH THEN I CRASH INTO A A SLUMBER A DEEP NIGHT OF SLEEP  IS THAT SLEEP REALLY AS DEEP AS I THINK IT IS BECAUSE GIVEN THE HALF LIFE OF KAFFNE THAT YOU MENTION A FEW MOMENTS AGO HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT HAVING SOME OF THAT KAFINE CIRCULATING IN MY SYSTEM MIGHT DISRUPT THE DEPTHS OF SLEEP WERE SOMEHOW THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP AND AWAY THAT EVEN IF I GET AIGTOR WHO KNOWS EVEN TEN HOURS OF SLEEP IT MIGHT NOT BE AS RESTORATIVE AS I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE YM AND THAT IS THE DANGER JUST AT OF THAT YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU DESCRIBED WHO SAY AND I WELL LOT OF THEM WELL I'M SPEEP WITH ME TOO SAY LOOK I CAN HAVE TWO ESPRESSERS WITH DINNER AND I FULL ASLEEP FINE AND I STAY ASLEEP BECAUSE Y USUALLY THOSE OF THE TWO FENA TYPES THAT WE TYPICALLY SEE WITH TOO MUCH KAFFIN I JUST CAN'T FULL ASLEEP AS EASILY AS I WANT TO OR I FULL ASLEEP BUT JUST CAN'T STAY ASLEEP AND KAFFIN CAN DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS QUITE POTENTLY HOW LATE IN THE DAY DO YOU THINK IS ASSUMING SOMEBODY TRANSLITE THIS VOKS IF YOU GO TO BED OR ORLY R OR LATOR Y AFE TER SHIFT E THE HOURS ACCORDINGLY BUT GIVEN A SOMEBODY WHO TYPICALLY GOT GETS IN TO BED AROUND AN AND THIRTY AND FALLS ASLEEP ROUND ELEVEN ELEVEN THIRDY O WHEN WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE HALT KAFFIN IN TAK AND AND THESE ARE NOT A STRICT PRESCRIPTIRS BUT ID THINK PEOPLE DRE BENEFIT FROM HAVING SOME A VAIRLY CLEAR GUIDE LINES OF WY MY MIGHT WORK FOR THEM WOULD YOU SAY CUT OFF KAFFIN BY WHAT TIME OF THE DAY I WOULD USUALLY SAY TAKE YOUR TYPICAL BEDTIME AND COUNPT BACK SEAD OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO EIGHT HOURS IS PROBABLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT CLOSE BUT TAKE BACK INSTEAD OF TEN HOURS OR EIGHT HOURS OF TIME THAT'S THE TIME WHEN YOU SHOULD REALY STOP YOU KNOW USING KAFFIN IS THE SUGGESTION AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO EVEN JUST KEEP DRINKING UP UNTIL YOU KNOW THE INTO THE EVENING YOU'R WRIT THAT THEY CAN FULL ASLEEP FINE MAY BE THEY STAY ASLEEP BUT THE DEPTH OF THE DEEP SLEEP IS NOT AS DEEP ANY MORE AND SO THERE ARE TWO CONSEQUENCE IS THE FIRST IS THAT FOR MEAT AND IT CAN BE UP TO BY THIRTY PERCEND AND FOR ME TO DROP YOUR DEEP SLEEP BY THIRTY PERSENT I'D HAVE TO AGE YOU BY BETWEEN TEN TO TWELVE YEARS OR YOU CAN JUST DO IT EVERY NIGHT YOURSELF WIT THE COPLE OF ASPRESSOS THE SECOND IS THAT YOU THEN WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND YOU THINK WHILE I DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEMS FALLING ASLEEP AND I DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEM STAYING ASLEEP BUT I DON'T FEEL PARTICULARLY RESTORED BY MY SLEEP SO NOW I'M REACHING FOR THREE OR FOUR CUPS OF COFFEE THE NEXT MORNING RATHER THAN JUST TWO OR THREE CUPS OF COFFEE AND SO GOES THIS DEPENDENCY CYCLE THAT YOU THEN NEED YOUR UPPERS TO WAKE YOU UP IN THE MORNING AND THEN SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL USE ALCOHOL IN THE EVENING TO BRING THEM DOWN BECAUSE THEIR OVERLY AFFANATED AN ALCOHOLAN WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT THAT TOO ALSO HAS VERY DILITERIOUS IMPACTS ON YOUR SLEEP AS WELL SO YOU'R RITE THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE QUANTITY OF YOUR SLEEP OR EVEN DIFFICULTIES FALLING OR STAYING ASLEEP CAN ALSO BE DEEP SLEEP BUT HERE AGAIN I THINK YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIGHTENING PEEPLE AND I MENTION THIS BEFORE I THINK ONE OF THE REAL PROBLEMS THAT I OR MISTAKES THAT I MADE CAUSE I DIDN'T YOU KNOW I'D NEVER HAD MUCH PUBLIC EXPOSURE BEFORE THE BUCK AND AND I WAS SO SADDEND BY YOU KNOW THE DISEASE AND THE SUFFERING THAT I WAS SEEING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A LACK OF SLEEP IN OUR SOCIETY AND THE FACT THAT IT WASN'T REALDY BEING DISCUSSED VERY MUCH I SORD OF CAME OUT A YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT HEAD STRONG MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT HEADSTRONG AND I THINK I WAS YOU KNOW PERHAPS TOO TOO MUCH GASPEDAL AND TOO LITTLE YOU KNOW BREAK AS IT WERE AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WA TO APPROACH HEALTH MESSAGE WITHIN THE PUBLIC SPHERE AND I'VE BECOME MUCH SOFTRA IN HOW I THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS I HAVE IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE IDEAL WORLD LOOKS LIKE FOR SLEEP BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT NONE OF US LIVE IN THIS THING CALLED THE IDEAL WORLD WE CERTAINLY S ALSO YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE REALLY MINDFUL OF THAT AND I THINK I'VE DONE A REALLY BAD JOB OF BEING SORT OF PATOO FORTHRIGHT PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH SLEEP YU KNOW ILY ON WHEN I ULD OFFER THESE SORT OF MESSAGES ABOUT SLEEP I WANT TO BE YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE VERITICAL WHEN IT COMES TO THE SCIENCE I WANT TO BE FAITHFUL TO THE SCIENCE BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO GO OUT AND SCA THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THER SLEEP CAUSE IT'S PROBABLY ONLY GOT TO MAKE MASSES WAS SO I'VE BEEN BUSIVFULLY SCHOOLED BY I'M LEARNING HOW TO BE A SLIGHTLY BEST OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATES I'M NO ANEAR OF THE SENDING THAT THAT YOU ARE YOU'RE VERY ELEGANT AND IT'S VERY INTUITIVE TO YOU I'M STILL WITH TRAINING WHEELS BUT I'M GETTING A LITTLE BIT BESTA BUT I DON'T I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WHEN I'M SPEAKING ABOUT KAFIN CASS IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH I'M VERY I'M SOT OF OVAT ABOUT IT BUT I WILL COME BACK TO WHY I SAY DRINK COFFEE I'M BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT NO I APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THAT POINT AND I'M SURE OUR LISTENERS WILL TOO I'M I STILL WILL I'M STAND BEHIND MY STATE MENT I'M WHICH IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR THE NOTION THAT SLEEP IS VITAL FOR ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH AND FOR PERFORMANCE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL AND WAKEFULNESS THE MESSAGE AN THAT AND THE PACKAGING IT WAS CONTAINED IN AND IS HAS BEEN CLEARLY CLEARLY NET POSITIVE PEOPLE NEEDED TO BE CUED TO THIS NOT I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD MENTALITY IS ONE THAT I HAD IT'S ONE THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE I'M PEOPLE IN A HUGE NUMBER OF VITAL COMMUNITIES NOT JUST YOUR YOUR STUDENTS BUT ALSO I'M PEOPLE THIS THE MESSAGEING THAT YOU PROVIDED AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE FIRST RESPONDOR COMMUNITY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THERE STILL STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN THE MILITARY COMMUNITY AND OF COURSE THE'S CIVILIAN COMMUNITY AND SO I THINK THESE ADJUSTMENTS ABOUT YE CAFINE'S OKA JUST RESTRICT IT TO THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY IF YOU CAN MOST DAYS I'M MANT MAKE THE LAW F AVERAGES ETLY THE LIGHT VIEW IN BEHAVIOR I THINK IT IS CRITICAL TO VIEW SUNLIGHT OR NATURAL SOME OTHER FORM OF BRIGHT LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY BUT IF YOU MISS A DAY IT'S NOT THAT YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM AS GOTINGS AT ILAND TO A PUDDLE OF TEARS THT DON'T  THAT OLL HAPPEN ON THE SECOND OR THE THIRD DAY NOT G BIOLOGY WORKS IN AVERAGES EXACCEPT WITH RESPECT TO ACCIDENT OR INJURY A CAR ACIT IS A CAR ACCIDENT RIGHT YOU DON'T GET TO HAVE THREE OF THOSE BEFORE THE BRAIN DAMAGE OCCURS IF THE ACCEDENTS SEVERE ENOUGH BUT WITH SLEEP BEHAVIOR OF THESE I'M HOMEOSTATIC TYPE BEHAVIORS OR WITH FOOD ONE CHOCOLATE S ONDAY IS AGAIN TO KILL YOU NO EVERY NIGHT YET IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU DIMENTED AND KILL YOU EARLY WE KNOW THIS AND SO I THINK THE THE MIDDLE GROUND IS OFF IN A HARD PLACE TO ACHIEVE UM SO I THINK YOU'VE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOWBUT I APPRECIATE YOU RAISING THESE POINTS AND AND I THINK UM IT'S CLEAR THAT WE ALL NEED TO THAT WE ALL CAN AND SHOULD DO CERTAIN THINGS BETTER INCLUDING BEING GENTLE WITH OURSELVES FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN WE DEVIATE FROM THESE A THESE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES ALONG THESE LINES I I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALCOHOL ECAUSE I THINK KAFIN AND ALCOL REPRESENT THE ON THE CON OF TWO OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SPACTRUM CLEARLY THEREARE OTHER STIMULANTS ON THERE YOUR ATARALLS AND YOUR A HIGH ENERGY DRINKS THAT PEOPLE USES BUT ALCAL IN KAFFIN ARE ARE THE MOST COMMONLY CONSUMED A STIMULANTS AND ANSEDITIVES TE PRESSENCEES ARE SOMETIMES CALL SO A WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY HAS A GLASS WE ALWAYS HEAR A GLASS OR TWO OF WINE IN THE EVENING OR ER A A ACOCCTAIL AFTER DINNER THEWER BEFORE DINNER HOW DOES THAT IMPACT THEIR SLEEP AND THEN WE'LL BE SURE TO CIRCLE BACK IN TERMS OF WHAT IS REASONABLE RANGES OF BEHAVIOR WHEN IT COMES TO AVOIDING ALCOHOL OR IF IT'S AGE APPROPRIATE ET CETERA ENJOYING ALCOHOL E SO ALCOHOL IF WER THINKING ABOUT CLASSES OF DRUGS THEREIN A CLASS OF DRUGS THAT WE CULL THE SEDATIVES AND I THINK ONE OF THE FUS PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE OFTEN MISTAKE ALCOHOL IS OFTEN USED AS A SLEEP AID FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH SLEEP WHEN THINGS LIKE OVER THECOUNTER REMEDIES ET CETERO HAV REMEDIES HAVE JUST NOT WOKED OUT FOR THEM AN ALCOHLN FORTUNEY IS ANYTHING BUT A SLEEP AID THE FIRST REASON THAT MOST PEOPLE USE IT IS TO TRY AND HELP THEM FULL ASLEEP SOAND THIS PROCESS OF THIS EVENT THAT WE CALL FALLING ASLEEP AFE TO IMAGINE IS A PROCESS IT IS LIKE ALITING UMBALGEER END THAT THAT PROCESS INVOLVES IN SOME WAY AS WE TALK ABOUT PUSHPOLE BEFORE TURNING OFF THINKING PLANNING YE ET CETERA AND TURNING ON SOME SORT OF RELAXATION MECHANISM I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THESE TWO THINGS ARE NOPBS TURNING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THAT JRAINS US THIS AUTCOME WE CALL FALLIN ASLEEP ALCALL IT SEEMS IS HELPFUL FOR SOME PEOPLE TO TURN OFF THEIR FTHOUGHTS AR THEIR PLANNING IS THAT RIGHT YES IT IS AND SO I THINK YEIF WE LOOK AT THE PATERN OF BRAIN ACTIVIT IF I WERE TO PLACE YOU INSIDE AND AMARISCANA WE ERE LOOKING AT THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR BRAIN AND WHAT YOU DRIFTING OFF SOME POTS IF YOUR BRAIN WILL BECOME LESS ACTIVE OTHER POTS WILL BECOME MORE ACTIVE AND THIS IS THE PUSHPULL MUDDLES INABITION EXCITATION BUT ALCOHOL IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN THAT REGARD ALCOHOL IS BECAUSE IT'S ASEDATIVE WHATS IT'S READY DOING IS TRANKTO SENCIALY KNOCK OUT YOUR QUOTEX IT'S SEDATING YOUR QUOTEX AN SEDATION IS NOT SLEEP BUT WHEN WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DRINKS IN THE EVENING WHEN WE HAVE A COUPLE OF NIGHT CAPS WE MISTAKE SIDATION FOR SLEEP SAYING WHILE I ALWAYS WHEN I HAVE  COUPLE OF WHISKES OR A COUPLE OF COCK TAILS IT ALWAYS HELPS ME FULL ASLEEP FASTER IN TRUTH WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT YOU'R LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS QUICKER BUT YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY FALLING NATURALISTICALLY ASLEEP ANY QUICKER SO THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST SAID OF THINGS JUST TO KEEP IN MIND THE SECOND THING WITH ALCOHOL IS THAT IT FRAGMENTS YOUR SLEEP AND WE SPOKE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF YOUR SLEEP BEING JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE QUANTITY AND ALCOHOL THROUGH A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS AT SOME OF WHICH ARE ACTOFATION OF THAT AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT BRENCH OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ALCOHOL WILL ACTUALLY HAVE YOU WAKING UP MANY MORE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT SO YOUR SLEEP IS FAR LESS CONTINUOUS NOW SOME OF THOSE AWAKENINGS WILL BE OF CONCTIOUS RECOLLECTION THE NEXT DAY YOU'LL JUST REMEMBER WAKING UP MANY OF THEM WON'T BE AND SO BUT YET YOU'R SLEEP WILL BE LITTED WITH THESE ST OF PUNCTURED AWAKENINGS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WHEN YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING YOU DON'T FEEL RESTORED BY YOUR SLEEP YOU KNOW FRAGMENTED SLEEP OR NON CONTINUOUS SLEEP IN THIS ALCOHOL IN DUSED WAY IS USUALLY NOT GOOD QUALITY SLEEP THAT YOU FEEL GREAT ON THE NEXT DAY THE THE THIRD PART OF ALCOHOL INTEMPTS OF AN EQUATION IS THAT IT'S QUITE POTENT O BLOCKING YOUR REM SLEEP YOUR RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP AN REMSLEEP IS CRITICAL FOR A VARIETY OF COGNTIVE FUNCTIONS AM  SOME ASPECTS OF LEARNING IN MEMORY SEEMS TO BE CRITICAL FOR ASPECTS OF EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH YOU'VE DESCRIBED IT BEFORE AS A SORT OF SELF GENERATED THERAHBY THAT OCCURS WHILE WE SLEEP YEIT'S OVERNIGHT THERAHBY YOU KNOW IT'S EMOTIONAL FIRST AID IT'S OTOINLY YOU RETHER DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP AM OR VERY EASY TO DERAIL EMOTIONALLY YEIM NOT THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT TO PEOPLE BUT WE ALL SORT OF FALL APART EMOTIONALLY ARE  I I WAS TING THAT ALMOST LIKE OUR SKIN SENSITIVITY CAN BE HEIGHTENED YES WHEN WE ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED AM ARE EMOTIONAL SENSITIVITY I IS SUCH THAT WHEN WE'RE SLEEP DEPRIVES A SUCH THAT IT TAKES A AM MUCH FINER GRAIN OF SAND PAPER TO CREATE THAT KIND OF FRICTION YES BOTHERS IT THRESHOLD ETEN ON I RECOMMENTS BOTHER US WHEN WE'RE SNA AND NEER WHEN WAT WI A LET TO SAY THAT I NEVER LOOK AT THEM EXCEPT I LOOK AT AN I SHULD VER YEAVY EVERYBR I WEL ET IT I REALIZE BECAUSE THE NOTION OF NOT LOOKING AT COMMENTS IS M IS UNREASONABLE FOR TO ASK OF ANY ACADEMIC BECAUSE ACADEMICS WE ARE ALL TRAIN TO LOOK AT OUR TEACHING ONVALUATIONS AND JUST LIKE WITH ON LINE COMMENTS TO IGNORE TWENTY PERSON OF THEM NIM KIDOAN LE THEM ALL AN AN INTEN SO IN TERMS OF TRANSLATENESS TO BEHAVIOUR I'M NOT I DON'T PARTICULARLY ENJOY ALCOHOL I GUESS I'M MIGHT BE FORTUNE IN THAT SENSE BUT I ALSO HAVE NE VER REALLY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PLEASURE OF OF DRINKING A ALCALL I SOMETIMES LIKE THE TASTE OF OF A DRINK BUT I NEVER LIKE THE SENSATION SO THAT'S HA I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF A FAMILIARITY WITH THIS BUT MANY PEOPLE DO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SO LET'S SAY UM SOMEBODY AENJOYS A GLASS OF WINE OR TO WITH DINNER AND THE DINNER AT SEVEN P M IS THAT LIKELY TO DISTROP THEIR SLEEP AT ALL WHAT'S JUST SORT OF LET'S MAKE THIS A A SERIES OF GRADATIONS EM AND THE ENSIS S YES EM I THINK ONCE ITY JUST LOOKED AT A SINGLE GLASS OF WINE IN THE EVENING WITH DINNER AND I WOULD BE UNTRUTHFUL IF I DIDN'T JUST SIMPLY SAY IT HAS AN EFFECT AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT IN SO LESS YOIM SLEEP LESS REM SLEEP AND ONE OF THE FASCINATING STUDIES I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT DOSE I THINK THEY GOT THEM CLOSE TO ASTAND E I'M ILLEGAL BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL SO MAYBE THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT TIP SLEEP AND YES YOU SEE ALL OF THE CHANGES THAT WE JUST DESCRIBED IM THEY SOT OF LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS MORE QUICKLY THEY HAVE FRAGMENTED SLEEP AND THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN REM SLEEP BUT WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING BECAUSE REM SLEEP AS WE SPOKE ABOUT BEFORE IS A TIME WHEN SOMEHOMONAL SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIALLY RECHARGED AND REFRESHED GROWTH HORMON BEING ONE OF THEM THOSE WELL OVER A FIFTY PER CENT FIVE ZERO DROP IN THEIR GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE DURING ALCOHOL LACED SLEEP AT NIGHT A KNOTHORMON IS SO VITAL FOR METABOLISM AND REPAIR OF TIAMS AND YO AM 'S NOT JUSING BODY TAT LOS ESENTIAL TENTIALS INESSANTIAL AM ALONG THOSE LINES I I JUST WANT A HIGHLIHE THE FACT THAT THIS UM THIS INFORMATION THEYURE SHORING THAT GROWTH HORMON IS RELEASE IS STRONGLY TATHERED TO THE PRESENCE OF HEALTHY AMOUNTS OF REM SLEEP IS INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE GROWTHORMON WAS RELEASED IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NIFE WELL IT IS RELEASED I MIM ACROSS BOTH OF THOSE BUT CROSS THE DIFFERENT STAGES BUT WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT WHEN YOU DISR REM SLEEP THE'RE ARE THOSE GROWTH HOMON CONSEQUENS IS SO IT'S NOT AN EXCLUSIVE A SYSTEM JUST LIKE WITH TESTOSTRONE WE CAN SEE CHANGES THROUGHOUT NONREM SLEEP BUT IF YOU ASK WHEN ARE THE PEAK RELEASE RATES OFF TESTOSTRONE IT'S RIGHT BEFORE WE GO INTO REM SLEEP AND THEN JORING REM SLEEP AND OF COURSE R TESTASTRON BEING IMPORTAN BOTH FOR FOR MALS AN AMEMALS RI AVER LIBIDO AND TISSUE REPAIRING WELL BEING THAT NOBODY REGARDLESS OF CROMOSOMO HORMONO OR ANY OTHER BACKGROUND WANTS TO HAVE THEIR NORMAL LEVELS OF TESTOSTRON REDUCED ACUTELY THAT'S NOT A BAD I I IT ACQUITES TO A TERRIBLE SET OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ND PHYSICAL SEMPTEM YND THE MORTALITY RISK THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH LOTESTOSTRONE IS NONTRIILI CANSWER RIGHT EXACTLY YOU KNOW SO COMING BACK TO JUST THE POINT ON REM SLEEP THAT YOU MENTIONED REGARDING EMOTIONAL INSTABILITY AND WE SEE THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE MOST RELI ABLE SIGNATURES OF JUST INSUFFICIENT SLEEP DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SLEEP DEPROVATION WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS HERE AT THE SLEEPS CENTER IS THAT THERE IS NO MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER THAT WE CAN FIND IN WHICH SLEEP IS NORMAL AND SO I THINK THAT FIRST SLEE TOLD US THERE IS A VERY INTIMATE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOUR EMOTIONAL MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR SLEEP HEALTH BUT WHEN IT ALSO COMES TO REM SLEEP I THINK WHAT'S FASCINATING IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOUR EMOTIONAL HEALTH IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOUR HORMONAL HEALTH AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN SEEING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUNO COGNITION BUT THEN THERE WAS A A REPORT I THINK IT COULDHAVEBEEN ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO OUT OF HARVARD AN I THINK IT WAS BETH A CLEARMANCE GROUP A THEY FOUND THAT AND THEY REPLICATED IT IN TWO DIFFERENT LARGE POPULATIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT SLEEP STAGES TO YOUR LIFE SPAN REM SLEEP WAS THE STRONGEST PREDINCTOR OF YOUR LONGJEVITY AND IT WAS A LINEA RELATIONSHIP BUT WASN'T IT SORT OF ONE OF THESE YOU SHAPE OR JAY SHAPED CURVES THAT WE OFTEN SEE WITH TOTAL SLEEP AND MORTALITY RISK IT REALLY WAS LINEA THAT THE LESS AND LESS REM SLEEP THAT YOU WERE GETTING THE HIGHER AND HIGHER YOUR PROBABILITY OF DEATH AND THEN THEY DID WAS THAT TATH DYO DO AM NATURAL CAUSES S ACCIDENTS I CAN IMAGINE YOU'D I GAIN OF REM SLEEP YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO DRIVE OFF THE FREE WAY STUP OFFICALLY I THINK IT WAS ALL COURSE MAHT A AD DECISIONS ABOUT ANYTHING IN LOVE RELATIONSHIPS YE I CAN ALSO BE LIFE THREATEN YE I'VE TRIED TO LEAN INTO THAT AN CLAIM THAT I AM WITH THOSE BAD RELATIONSHIP SITUATIONS THOH I JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH AND LIKEN ELSE LI MI DARLING AN  EVEY SLEEP THE EARTH AND A BUT A IS FAR WISER THAN THAN I THOUGHT BUT AM SO THEYVE DID THIS GREAT MACHINE LEARNING ANALYSIS AND I MAY GET THESE NUMBERS BACKWARDS BUT I THINK FOR EVERY FIVE PER CENT REDUCTION IN REM SLEEP THERE WAS A THIRTEEN PER CENT AS SOCIATED INCREASE RISK OF MORTALITY OW AND I COULD HAVE I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK AND AND CHECK BUT TO ME AND IN THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGRE THEM WHAT THEY ALTIMATELY SPAT OUT WAS THAT OF ALL F THE SLEEP STAGES REM SLEEP IS THE MOST PREDICTIVE OF YOUR LONGJEVITY OF YOUR LIFESPAN SO WE OFTEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAYING HOW CAN I GET MORE DEEP SLEEP A OR THEY SOMETIMES SAY HOW CAN I GET MORE DREAM SLEEP AND MY ANSWER IS A QUESTION WHY DO YOU WANT TO GET MORE OF THAT AND I'LL SAY WHAT ISN'T THAT THE GOOD STUFF AND I'LL SAY WELL ATCH THE ALL STAGES IT'S ALL THE GOSLEEP  ARE YET WHA'S LIKE THE EXERCISE QUESTION AND IT TOOK DECADES FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT MOVING AROUND AT A FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PROBABLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MINUTES A WEEK AT DOING ENDURANCE TYPE WORK IS OWN TOO CARDIO IT'S NOT TYPE WORE IS IS CORRELATED WITH LIVING LONGER FEELING BETTER LAST I BEDIS THAT'S THAR THERE'S REALLY NO WAY AROUND IT AND W YOU CAN AM YOU CAN INJEST MET FOREMAN UNTIL THE COWS COME HOME ND YOU CAN TAKE IN AMEN WALL OF WHICH I THINK HAVE HAVE THEIR PLACE AND AM CERTAIN CONTACTS O'M BIG FAN OF THE WORK SURROUNDING ALL ALL THOSE PROTOCLANT LIKE WIS BUT WITHOUT GETTING PROPER AMOUNTS OF MOVEMENT MEANING SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OFT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY TWELVE MENUTE EXERCISE REGIMES YOU FOLLOW FOR WHIT YOU NEED THAT THRESHOLD LEVEL AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SAME IS TRUE OF REMSLEEP AND TO AND TOTAL AMOUT OFSLEEP THIS IS  YE YOU AM YOU PAY THE PIPER SOMEHOW YET HE RETUNON INVESTMENT I MEAN TO TO FLIT THE COIN THE RETUN ON INVESTMENT IS IS ASTRONOMICAL YEN I THINK OF SLEEP ITS IT IS THE TIDE THAT MOVES YOU KNOW THAT RAISES OLL OF THOSE HELF BOATS AND THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL LAYER OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH WHENEVER PEOPLE ASK ME A EVEN THOUGH NY PHYSICIAN THEY'LL ASK ME  WHAT WHAT SHOULD I WHAT H I TAKE OR WHAT SHOULD I DO THE FIRST QUESTION IS ALWAYS HOW'S YOUR SLEEP GREENING HOW WELL DO YOU SLEEP EVERY NIGHT AND AND HOW HOW LONG YOU SEE MY ALWAYS RECOMMEND YOUR BOOK I ALWAYS RECOMMEND YOUR POCK I YOU YOU KNOW THE PODCAS YOU'VE BEEN A AA GUESSED ON ET CETERA AM WHO KNOWS MAY BE LEAVE IN RELEASE YOUR OWN POT CASTIN BECAUSE I DO THINK PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU MORE OFTEN ONE THING I I DON'T ON O RETURN TO THE THE NOTION OF OF A PUBLIC HEALTH A DISCOURSE TOO MUCH BUT I DO WANT TO SAY ONE ISSUE WITH BOOKS IN GENERAL IS THAT THEY CAN BE REVISED BUT IT'S MORE OR LESS A ONE AND DONE KIND OF THING AND UNTIL THE NEXT BOOK COMES OUT YE ONE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THE POD CAST FOREMAT IS THAT UPDATES CAN BE PROVIDED REGULARLY CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES AS NEW DATA COME OUT AND SO THAT'S A A WONDERFUL ASPECT TO TO THIS FORMAD AND AND A HOPFULLY THE FOREMAT THAT YOU'LL BE YTHING I I HAV WORL NEEDS TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU MORE OFTEN ABOUT SLEEP IN ITS VARIOUS CONTOURS AM NOT LESS AND AM SO I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT A DRINKING ALCOHOL YE NOT THAT WE WANT TO PROMOTE DAY DRINKING BUT LET'S SAY THAT THE ONE OR TWO GLASSES OF INE OR COCKTAIL IS CONSUMED WITH LUNCH SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TRADITIONALLY DONE NOWADAYS OR IN A LATE AFTERNOON HAPPY HOUR TOT COCKTAIL AND THEN ONE IS GOING TO SLEEP SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS LATER DO YOU THINK THAT THAT WILL IMPROVE OR SOMEHOW MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL OR IF YOU HAVE A DRINK ARE YOU ARE YOU BASICALLY SCREWED FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS NO I THINK THIS GOING TO BE A A A TIME WINDOW DEPENDENT SEE NOW I DON'T KNOW OF ANY ONE WHOSE ESCENTIALLY DONE WHAT YOU AND I WOULD LIGHT WHICH IS THE TIME SEPARATION DOSE DEPENDENT CAVE WER OCA YOU DRINK AT TEN A M THEN OR EELEVEN TWELVE ONE TO THREE FOR FIVE OLL AWAY UP TO YOUN O TEN P M AN ESTIMATE WHAT IS THE BLAST RADIUS AN IS IT LINIA OR IS IT NON LINIA IS IT SUCH THAT ONLY WHEN YOU DRINK IN THE LAST FOUR HOURS D YOU JUST HIT THIS EXSPENANTIAL AND IT'S BAD BAD BAD OR IS THE SOME OTHER CUV THAT WE CAN IMAGINE THERE WOULD BE MANY POSSIBILITIES BUT CERTAINLY WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE LASS ALCOHOL AND LESS AND MOST SPECIFICALLY THE METABOLIC BY PRODUCTS ALTOHIDES AND KEYTONES THAT THE SORT OF THE NEPHARIOUS PLAY IS YOU NOT THE EYTONES THAT PEOPLE ARE ALL ES I KNOW ABOUT  DO NO THER KTHE OTHER KEYTONES YES THEY TO MAY A CAVE US TO KNOW WHAT WERE FORND YENBITS IS NOT ABOUT KEYSA GENIS THIS IS NOT ABOUT KEETER JENS HES NA HEATONE BODIES AND A THAT A RELEASED A AFTER IN JESTING ALCOHOL THAT ARE NOT OF THE POSITIVE SORT DIRECT THAT A A KITO GANIC DIET MIGHT PROMOTE RIGHT NOW SO I THINK IN TERMS OF THAT ALCOHOL A PROFILE WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT YOUAS YOUR HEADING INTO THE EVENING HOURS ONCE AGAIN TIMING IN DOSE MAKE THE POISON BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT ONCE AGAIN FROM THAT PUBLIC A MESSAGE THAMPOY AND THANK YOU I THINK I I I AM LEANING INTO THE T OF THE PODCAST A CONSIDERATION ARENA AT SOME POINT BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE PURITANICAL HERE YOU KNOW I'M JUST A SCIENTIST AND I'M NOT HERE TO TELL ANY ONE HOW TO LIVE ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS IMPOWER PEOPLE WITH SOME OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE REGARDING SLEEP AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE WHATEVER INFORMED CHOICES THAT YOU WANT NOW INM LIKE YOU IT TURNS OUT I'M NOT TO BIG DRINKAADS JUST BECAUSE I'VE NEVER LIKED THE TASTE AND I'M SURPRISE THAT THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN AWAY MY BRITISH PASSPORT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE LOGER OR O BEA AM BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT LIFE IS TO BE LIVED TO A CERTAIN DEGREE IT'S ALL ABOUT CHECKS SOME BALANCEIS SO YOU KNOW IF I GO OUT AND YOU KNOW I HAVE AN ICE CREAM SUNDAY I'M NOT BIG ON THOSE EITHER BUT NOW SURE I KNOW THAT MY YOU KNOW BLOOD GLUCOS IS NOT GOING TO BE IDEAL FOR ANOTHER TWELVE HOURS MAYBE THAT'S JUST THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR HAVING SOME KIND OF RELAXED FUN LIFE I DON'T WANT TO LOOK BACK ON LIFE AND THINK GUSH YOU KNOW I LIVED UNTIL I WAS YOU KNOW A HUNDRED AND ELEVEAN AND IT WAS UTTERLY MISERABLE YOU KNOW RIGHT SO BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT SOME KIND OF A BALANCE AN MINE MY JOB IS NOT TO TO TELL PEOPLE A'M A PRESCRIPTION FOR LIFE IT'S JUST TO OFFER SOME SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION I THINK YOU'RE DOING A TERRIFIC JOB OF THAT PEOPLE ARE I WU SAY WE HAVE ALL THESE NERL CIRCUITS AND AM IF IT'S WORKING PROPERLY WE ALL HAVE A CIRCUIT THAT ALLOWS US TO U SKIP OVER INFORMATION OR AS WE WISH RIGHT IF THE CIRCUITS BETWEEN YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR THUMBS ARE WORKING YOU CAN SLIDE RIGHT ALONG YOU CAN DROP TO THE NEXT A CONTENT HOW VER YOU LIKE I I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ABOUT MAROWANA AND SEEBIDI THERES A DISCUSSION THAT I THINK FIVE YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE VENTURED INTO THE REALM OF E LEGAL BUT NOW YER IN MANY PLACES NOT ALL MEDICAL MAROUANA IS APPROVED OR IS LEGAL AND CERTAINLY IT'S IN WIDESPREAD USE CERTAINLY NOT RECOMMENDING PEOPLE DO IT I HA MY OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT A MAROWANA C B  I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE I SUPPOSE THAT I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE MAROWANA OR C B D I DON'T EVEN KNOW I'VE EVER TRIED C B D AM FIRST OF ALL DOES MAROWANA DISRUPT THE DEPTH OF SLEEP THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP ON AND IF SO A AS WITH ALCON KAFFIN DOES WHEN YOU A IN JESTIT OR WHEN IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM DOES RELATIVE TO WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP DOES THAT MIN AN IMPORTANT RALSO DOES MAROWANA DISRUPT SLEEP YE IT IT DOES AND THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD AMOUNT OF DATA ON SO WE CAN BREAK A TO CANNABIST DOWN IN CO TWO OF ITS K INGREDIENTS WE'VE GOT T H C TETRA HYDRO CONABANAL AND WE'VE GOT C B D AND C B D IS SOT OF THE THE LESS PCYCLAT'S IT WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE NON PCSYCHO ACTIVE COMPONENT IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU TAKE C B D YOU DON'T GET HIGH IF YOU TAKE T H C YOU CAN GET HIGH THAT'S THE PCYCHO ACTIVE PART OF THE EQUATION ARE BOTH CONSIDERED SADITS AN THE TECHNICLES A NOW THEN NOT A NEITHER OF THEM HAVE THAT CLASS RIGHT NOW T H C CAN SEEMS TO SPEED UP THE TIME WITH WHICH YOU FALL ASLEEP BUT AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE ELECTRICAL BRAIN WAVE SIGNATURE OF YOUR FALLING ASLEEP WITH EM WITHOUT THAT T H C IT'S NOT CONTO BE AN IDEAL FIT SO YOU COULD ARGUE IT'S NON NATURAL BUT MANY PEOPLE USE T H C FL THAT FACT BECAUSE THEY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FALL ASLEEP AND IT CAN SPED THE ONSET OF AT LEAST NON CONSCIOUSNESS I GUESS THE BEST WAY OF DESCRIBING IT BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH T H C AND THERE ARE TWOFOLT THE FIRST IS THAT IT TWO BUT THROUGH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS SEEMS TO BLOCK REM SLEEP AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY USING WILL TELL ME YOU KNOW I I DEFINITELY I WAS DREAMING I DON'T REMEMBER YOU KNOW MANY OF MY DREAMS AND THEN WHEN THEY STOP USING A T H C THE SAY I WAS HAVING YOU KNON'T JUST CRAZY CRAZY DREAMS AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THERE IS A REBOUND MECHANISM REM SLEEP IS VERY CLEVER AND ALCOHOL IS THE SAME WAY IN THIS SENSE ITS THE SAME HOMYESTATIC MECHANISM SOME PEOPLE WILL TELL ME LOOK IF I HAVE BIT OF A WILD FRIDAY NIGHT WITH SOME ALCOHOL YOU KNOW IT MAYBE I'LL SLEEP LATE INTO THE NEXT MORNING AND I'LL JUST HAVE THES REALLY INTENSE DREAMS SO AND I THOUGHT I WASN'T HAVING ANY REM SLEEP WAT THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT IT'S DURING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT REALLY AND WHEND ALCOHOL BLOCKS YOUR REM SLEEP AND YOUR BRAIN IS SMART IT UNDERSTANDS HOW MUCH REM SLEEP YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD HOW MUCH REM SLEEP YOU HAVE NOT BECAUSE THE ALCOHOLS BEEN IN THE SYSTM AND FINALLY IN THOSE EARLY MORNING HOURS WHEN YOUREGETTING THROUGH SYSMM YOU KNOW CIX ZAVIN  T AN ALL OF A CERTAIN YOUR BRAIN NOT ONLY GOES BACK TO HAVING THE SAME AMOUNT OF REM IT WOULD HAVE HAD IT DOES THAT PLU S IT TRIES TO GET BACK ALL OF THE REM SLEEP THAT IT'S LOST DOES IT GET BACK ALL OF THE REM SLEEP KNOW IT DOESN'T IT NEVER GETS BACK OL OF THE REM SLEEP BUT IT TRIES AND SO YOU HAVE THESE REALLY INTENSE PERIODS OF REM SLEEP HANCE YU HAVE RIDDY INTENSE BEZA DREAMS AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS ALSO WITH T H SEE YOU BUILD UP THIS PRESSIA FOR REM SLEEP THIS DAT FOR REM SLEEP WILL YOU EVER PAY IT BACK DOESN'T SEEM AS THOUGH YOU GET BACK EVERYTHING THAT YOU LOST BUT WILL YOU GET BACK SOME OF IT YES THE BRAIN WILL STORT TO DEVOUR MORE BECAUSE IT'S BEING STARVED OF REM SLEEP FOR SO LONG BUT ONE OF THE BIKER PROBLEMS WITH T H C THAT WE WORRY ABOUT IT S WITH DRUEL DEPENDENT C SO AS YOU STOUHT TO USE T H C FOR SLEEP THAT CAN B A A DEPENDENC TOLERANCE SO YOU STOP TO NEED MORE TO GET THE SAME SLEEP BENEFIT AND WHEN YOU STOP USING YOU USUALLY GET A VERY CEVERE REBOUND IN SOMNEA AND IN FACT IT'S SO POTENT THAT IT'S TYPICALLY POT OF THE CLINICAL IM WITH DREL PROFILE FROM T H C FROM CANABUS OES' THERE'S ANXIETY WITHDRAW I I AM I  YOU KNOW I DON'T I ASK ANYBODY TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR WE JUST AS YOU SAID WE TRY AND INFORM PEOPLE BY WHAT THE SCIENCE AS AND AND LET THEM MAKE CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES PEOPLE WERE REGULAR APOT SMOKERS IF YOU THAT MANY OF WILL INSIST THERE NOT ADDICTED AND AND MMAYBE INDEED THEY DON'T ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE PROFILE OF CLASSICAL ADDICTION I DON'T KNOW I'M GESSING SOME DU SOME DON'T BUT AM IF YOU ASK THEM WELL WHAT IF I TOOK AWAY ALL MAROWANA CONSUMPTION FOR A TWO WEEKS THAT THOUGHT SCARES MANY OF THEM AND MANY OF THEM WILL EXPERIENCE INTENSE ANXIETY WITHOUT MARAUANA WHICH SPEAKS TO PERHAPS NOT ADDICTION BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF DEPENDENCY AM AND AGAIN I I BEEN I KNOW MANY POT SMOKERS AM SOME OF WHOM I HAVE JOBS THAT ARE THAT ARE QUITE HIGH PERFORMING AND THEY AND THEY MANAGE HERE IN BONLY I DON'T KNOW ANY OF AN KNO KNOT  AM T THE WHAT ABOUT C B D I MAY WE HERE SO MUCH ABOUT C B DOI'VE BEEN A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT AM THE ANALYSIS OF A LOT OF C B D SUPPLEMENTS OUT THERE IS CONFIRMED THET MUCH LIKE WITH MELETONE AND THE LEVELS THAT ARE REPORTED ON THE LABELS IN NO WAY SHAP PERFORM MATCH THE LEVELS THAT ARE ACTUALLY CONTAINED IN THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS SOMETIMES THAT THE LEVELS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY'RE REPORTED ON THE LABELS OTHER TIMES IT'S MUCH LOWER AM WHAT IS IN JESTING C B D DU TO THE ARCHITECTURE AND QUALITY OF SLEEP RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH DE TO MAKE SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW MEANINGFUL SENSE OUT OF IT I THINK THE PICTURE THAT IS A MUDGING HOWEVER IS PROBABLY THE FOLLOWING FIRSTLY C B D DOES NOT SEEM TO B DET TREMENTFUL IN THE SAME WAYS THAT T H C IS SO WE CAN STOP BY SAYING IT DOES IT CREATE CREATE YOU KNOW POTENTIAL PROBLEMS NOT OF THE THE NATURE NECESSARILY THAT WE SEE WITH T H SEE BUT THE DEVIL IS A LITTLE BIT IN THE DETAILS FROM THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVEIN IT COMES ON TO YOU A VALID POINT OF PURITY AT LO DOSE C B D CAN SEEM TO BE WAKE PROMOTING SO ME IN LOWEDOSIS THAT SAY SOT OF FIVE OR TEN MELEGRAMS AN TRENC TO REMEMBER SOME OF THE STUDIES OF TOOK MY HEAD THERE IT ACTUALLY MAY IN HANDSWAKEFULNESS AND CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH SLEP IT'S ONLY ONCE YOU GET INTO THE HIHER DOSE RANGE THAT THERE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SOME YOU KOW INCREASE IS AT STRAY INCREASES IN SLEEPINESS OR SET OF SEDATION LIKEN AM INCREASES AND THAT'S USUALLY I THINK ABOVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MELIGRAMS AS BEST I CAN RECALL FROM THE DATA AND THEN WHEN WE LUK IN ANIMAL MODELS YOU TYPICALLY SE THE SAME TYPE OF PROFILE TOO SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES AND NOW AGAIN YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU KNOW PURIT IT'S SVERY DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH I THINK AND AGAIN I I NOT O USID NOT NECESRITY BECAUSE I YOU KNOW HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST IT IT'S JUST THAT'S NOT YOU KOW NESARITY MY CUP OF T THERE ARE SOME FIMS THAT ARE NOW DOING THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT LABORATORY TESTS I DON'T KNOW HOW GAMED THAT IS SO I'VE GOT NO SO I THINK I SOME I SUPPLEMENT COMPANIES ARE QUITE A HONEST AND ACCURATE ABOUT THE MOUNTS OF VERY SUBSTANCES THAT ARE IN OTHER A PRODUCTS AND SOME ERE NOT YO AND  I THINK THERE'S JUST A HUGE RANGE I THINK YEU AFTER A IS STARTING TO EXPLORE SB D THERE I CERTAINLY I SAW SOME GRANT ANNOUNCEMENTS TO EXPLORE YOURE FUNCTION SB MOST OF THE WORK ON SB D IS BEING DONE BY THE GENERAL POBLIC IN JUSTING IT AND HOW THEY FEEL I LEAVE IT TO MY DOG WHO WAS HAD SOME A DEMENTURE RELATED SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND IT ACTUALLY ET CREATED A HEIGHTEN WAKEFULNESS AT COMPLETELY SOTLY UP HIS IS SOUNDS AS TONLES OTIS ALL DOGS OT HES GON AND GET ACCESS TO SLEEPIES GAN A TAKE ET O GAM REALLY MASSED HIM UP TOOK TOOK IT AWAY HE DID BETTER AM BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S AT THAT'S A KENINE SO RAGT I COULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW TAT OF DOSE RELATED TOO BUT MINDERS OR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN THER SHURECT E AND WE BUT BUT RIGHT NOW IF WE WERE TO AND I'M NOT MAKING THE STATEMENT I DON'T THINK ANY ONE COULD MAKE THE STATEMENT NOW BUT IF IT ENDS UP BEING THAT C B D IS POTENTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR SLEEP HOW CAN WE RECONCILE HAT MECHANISTICALLY AND I THINK THERE ARE TO ME AT LEAST THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE CANDIDATE MECHANISMS THAT I'VE BEEN EXPLORING AND THINKING ABOUT THE FIRST IS THAT IT'S THEMOREGULATORY AND WHAT WE FOUND IN SOME ANIMAL MODELS IS THAT C B D AND WE'LL CREATE A PROFILE OF HIGH PO THERMIA IN OTHER WORDS IT COOLS THE BODY THE CALBODY TEMPERATURE DOWN AND THT SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS GOOD FOR SLEEP THE SECOND IS THAT IT'S AN ANXIOLITIC THAT IT CAN REDUCE ANXIETY AND THAT DATER IS ACTUALLY QUITE STRONG EVEN WITH SOME FUNCTIONAL IMAGING WORK THAT'S BEEN COMING OUT RECENTLY SHOWING THAT ONE EP CENTERE OF EMOTION WILL BE A MAKTULA DEEP WITHIN THE BRAIN IS QUIETAN DOWN WITH C B D SO I THINK THAT AT LEAST A SECONDS AND ON MUTETHAT'S ERATE THAT'S INDUSIVE IN A POSSIBILITY I THINK THE THIRD AM IS SOME RECENT DATES THAT'S COME OUT THAT WAS SUGGESTING THAT C B D CAN ALTER THE SIGNALLING OF A DENACENE SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU PRODUCE MORE A DENICENE BUT WHAT IT CAN DO IS PERHAPS MODULATE THE SENSITIVITY PERHAPS OF THE BRAIN SO THAT THE WEIGT OF THAT SAME A DENACENE IS WEIGTIA IN ITS BRAIN SIGNAL AND THEREFORE IT CREATES THIS STRONG OPPRESSIUE FOR SLEEP SO I THINK THESE ARE OL TENTATIVE MECHANISMS I THINK ANY ONE OF THEM IS FIABLE I THINK OLL THREE ARE FIABLE TOGETHER BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK DOES THAT SERT OF HELP THINK THROUGH THE THE TAPESTRY OF T H C AND C B D A VERY MUCH SO AND ACTUALLATES A IT'S A PERFECT SAGUAY FROM WE'VE TALKED ABOUT KAFIN ALCOHOL T H C AND C B D AS SORT OF A WEE FRAMED THEM ANYWAY AS THINGS THAT DONE IN MODERATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES ARE PROBABLY OKE FOR MOST PEOPLE CERTAINLY NOT FOR EVERYBODY THERE WILL BE DIFFERENCE AS IN SENSITIVITY BUT THAT DONE AT THE INCORRECT TIMES AND CERTAINLY IN THE INCORRECT AAMOUNTS WILL GREATLY DISRUP THIS VITAL STAGE OF LIFE WE CALL SLEEP C B D IT SEEMS REPRESENTS A KIND OF BRIDGE TO THE TOPIC I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT NEXT WHICH IS THINGS THAT PROMOTE MORE HEALTHY SLEEP OR SOMEHOW CONTRIBUTE TO ENHANCING THE ARCHITECTURE AND QUALITY OF SLEEP SO I'D LOVE TO CHAP OR MOMENT ABOUT THE KIND OF GRANT THE ORIGINAL I SHOULD SAY THAT NOT THE GRANDADY BUT THE O G OF SLEEP SOCCLEMENTATION WHICH IS MELATONA HERE THE SO CALLED HORNMONE OF DARKNESS A THAT'S INHIBITED BY LIGHT ET CETERA FRAME FOR US MELATONAN IN THE CONTECTS OF ITS NATURALLY OCCURRING FORM AND THEN I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MELATONEAN THE SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE AS IN MY EXPERIENCE ANY TIME I SAY THE WORD MELATONAN PEOPLE THING ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENT MELATONAND WHICH AR IN ITSELF IS AN INTERESTING AM A PHENOMENON THAT PEOPLE ARE SO CUE TO ITS ROLL AS SOMETHING YOU TAKE WE OFTEN FORGET THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE MAKE IN DOGENOUSLY I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO COMMEN IN PARTICULAR ON EVEN THOUGH WE WITHOUT NESSERLY GETTING INTOS PRECISE NANAGRAMS PRODESTS TA LEADER VALUES WHAT ARE THE TYPICAL AMOUNTS OF MELATONEAN THAT WE RELEASE EACH NIGHT AND THEN I'D LIKE TO COMPARE THAT TO WHAT IS CONTAINED IND SAY A THREE MELEGRAMOR SIX MELEGRAM TABLET THAT ONE MIGHT BUY AT THE PHARMACY RAT ITSO I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT HAS MELATONAN ALREADY KICKED IN BEFORE I SHUT MY EYES AND LAY DOWN MY HEAD USUALLY YES IF YOUR SYSTEM IS WORKING IN THE CORRECT WAIN AS DUSK IS STORTING TO HAPPEN SO LET'S SAY THAT YOU LOOK AT HUNTOGATHER A TRIBES WHO ON TOUCH BY ELECTRICITY AND SO THAT'S IT OF THE PURITENICAL STA PAR EXCELLANCE WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTRIC A LIGHT INFLUENCE AM AND USUALLY IT'S AS DUSK AS APPROACHING THATS WHEN MELATONE AN WELL START TO RISE AND SO WHEN YOU LOSE THE BREAK PEDALE OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE ISE THAT NORMALLY ACTS LIKE AHARD BREAK PEDAL THAT STAMPS DOWN AND PREVENTS THE RELEASE AND PRODUCTION OF OF MELATONEAN AS THAT LIGT BREAK PEDAL STATS TO FADE WITH DUSK THAND WE EASE OFF THE BREAK PEDAL AND MELATONE IN THE SPICKET OF MELALTEM MELATONE AN IS OPENED UP A MELATONE INSTARTS GETTING RELEASED AND USUALLY WILL SEE THIS RISING PEAK OF MELATONEAN AM SOME TIME YOU SALLE AN HOUR TWO HOURS LATER OR ROUND AND IT VARIES FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND THE TIME OF SLEEP ITSELF BUT IT'S ALREADY BEEN ON THE MARGE FOR SOME HOURS BEFORE YOU ATTUALLY HIT SLEEP ITSELF INTERESTING AND UP I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT AND I'M ASSUMING IT'S STILL TRUE THAT THE ONLY SOURCE OF MALETONEAND IN THE BRAIN EM BODY IS THE PINEEO GLAN IS THAT STILL TRUE IYE IT SEEMS TO BE FROM BEST THAT WE CAN TELL AND THE PINEOLGLAND AM SORT OF MEANING PELIKE BSERT OF A SHAPE ATTATUALLY I THINK OU SEY PEOPLE SAY ITS PELIKE I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE LATIN TERIFITIVE IT'S MORE AM I THINK IT'S DERIVE FROM PINE CONE NOT PE BECAUSE IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PENILA IT IS MORE PINE CONE JAPED ANCERS APTLY NAMED ANLY HUMAN BRAIN I'VE EVER DISSECTED WOI CONFESS A DAS A TELACK AS I TEACHNG ORONATOMY AND HAVE FOR YEARS AM I I LOVE LOOKING AT THE PIEOL IT'S THE ONE STRUCTURE IN THE BRAIN THAT'S NOT ON BOTH SIDES IS USUALLY PRETTY USY TO FINED AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD SIZE AT IT LOOKS LIKE A IT LOOKS LIKE A PE AND  IT'S SITTING RIGHT THERE AND IT'S REMARKABLE THAT IT RELEASES THIS HORMONE AS CERTAIT PROBABLY OUR ENTIRE LIFE SPAN AND IS INHIBITED BY LIGHT THE UM SO A PINEAL STARTS TO RELEASE THIS INTO THE GENERAL CIRCULATION AFTER IMAGINE WE OF MELEATONE A RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN EMBODY CORRECT SO YE ESSENTIUALLY YOUR BRAIN HAS A CENTRAL MASTER TWENTY FOUR HOUR 'CLOCK CALLED THE SUPERCIASMATIC NEU CLEUS THAT PEEPS INTERNAL TIME NOW IT'S NOT A PRECISE CLOCK IF LEFT TO ITS ONE DEVICES NOTHING THAT A SWISS CLOCK MAKER WOULD BE PROUD OF IT RUNS A LITTLE BIT LONG AND LAGGY LIKE AN AMERICAN CLOCK SO   O  OT AMERICAN WATCHES BY THE WAY A ANTANS AR VERIN R IS LIKE BUT NOT FAME AS FOR OUR TIME KEEPING OR OUR PUNCTUALITY FOR THAEM AR BUT THE SWISS ARE IT'S VERY IT IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE SWISS LIKE IT'S MORE BURCLED LIKE WHICH IS VERY RELAXED O YOU KNOW WHAT AVE AND SO IN MOST ADULTS IF THE AVERAGE IT OLT I SHOULD SAY YOUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK NORMALLY RUNS A LITTLE BIT LONG IT'S A BOWS AM ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND THIRTEEN MINUTES I THINK WAS THE LAST CALCULATION BUT THE REASON THAT WE DON'T KEEP DRIFTING FORWARD IN TIME AND COND OF RUNNING CONSISTENTLY E YOU KNOW MORE AND LATER AND LATER THIRTY MINUTES BY THIRTY MINUTES BY THIRTY MINUTES EACH DAY IS BECAUSE YOUR CENTRAL BRAIN CLOCK IT'S REGULATED BY EXTERNAL THING SUCH AS DAYLIGHT AND TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS FOOD AND ACTIVITY ALL OF THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FINGERS THAT COME ALONG AND ON THE RIST WATCH OF THE TWENTY FOUR CLOCK WILL PULL THE DIAL OUT AND RESET IT EACH DAY TO PRECISELY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND I MAKE THAT POINT BECAUSE IT KNOWS TWENTY FOUR HOUR TIME BUT IT NEEDS TO TELL THE REST OF THE BRAIN AND THE BODY THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR TIME AS WELL AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT IT DOES THIS IS BY COMMUNICATING A CHEMICAL SIGNAL OF TWENTY FOUR HOUR NURSE OF LIGHT AND DAY USING THIS HORMONE MELATONIN AND WHEN IT IS AT LOW LEVELS OR ITS NON EXISTENT IT'S COMMUNICATING THE MESSAGE IT'S DAYTIME AND FOR US DIANAL SPECIES IT SAYS IT'S TIME TO BE AWAKE YET AT NIGHT TIME WHEN DUSK APPROACHES AND THE BREAK COMES OFF MELATONAN AND WE STOT TO RELEASE IT THEN IT'S SIGNALS TO THE REST OF THE BRAIN AND THE BODY LOOK IT'S DUSK AND IT'S  NIGHT TIME AND FOR US DINAL SPECIES IT'S TIME TO THINK ABOUT SLEEP SO MELATONIN ESSENTIALLY TELLS THE BRAIN IN THE BODY WHEN IT'S DAY AND WHEN IT'S NIGHT AND WITH THAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO SLEEP WHEN IT'S TIME TO WAKE AND THEREFORE THAT'S WHY MELATONAN HELPS WITH THE TIMING OF THE ONSET OF SLEEP BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP WITH THE GENERATION OF SLEEP ITSELF AND THIS IS WHY WELL COME ON TO WHAT THOSE STUDIES OF SUPPLEMENTATION HAVE TAUGHT US SO I TELLS THE REST OF MY BRAIN AND BODY IT'S TIME TO GO TO SLEEP AN IT PERHAPS EVEN AIDS WITH THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO FOR INCIT'S INSURE THE OR ALL STRUCTURE OF SLEEP OR A IT'S NOT THE CONDUCTOR THAT'S GUIDING THE SLEEP ORCASTAR SO TO SPEEK THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRONITE YA IT'S E MORE LIKE THE UM THETHE PEOPLE THAT AS EMCALLY TAKE YOU TO YOUR SEET AND SIT YOU DOWN AND GIVE YOU YOUR PROGRAMME RA EXACTLY YES IT VTHE FAR AND LESS SOPHISTICATED ANALOGY I HAVE IS ARE YOR MELATONE IS LIKE THE STARTING OFFICIAL AT THE HUNDRED METER RACE IN THE OLYMPIC NOT A BETTER AND  IT COR CALLS ALL OF THE THE SLEEP RACES TO THE LINE AND IT BEGINS THE GREAT SLEEP RACE A BETTER IS NOLEGE I LIKE EOIA AN AS TA  AN AN TRETERA MONAE A BUT IT DOESN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE RACE ITSELF THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF BRAIN CHEMICALS AND BRAIN AND BRAIN REGIONS WHICH THEN BRINGS US ON TO PERHAPS THE QUESTION OF SUPPLEMENTATION WHICH IS IS IT HELPFUL FOR MY SLEEP WILL I SLEEP LONGER WILL I SLEEP BETTER AND IF I AM WHAT DOSES SHOULD I BE TAKING SADLY THE EVIDENCE IN HEALTHYP ADULTS WHO ARE NOT OLDER AGE SUGGEST THAT MELATONAN IS NOT REALLY PARTICULARLY HELPFUL AS A SLEEP AD I THINK HERE'S A RECENT METERANALYSIS THAT DEMONSTRATED WHEN I'M IT IT LOOKED AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SLEEP PER AMETIS MELATONAN CRAM ANMETERANALYSIS FOR THESE NOT KNOWING WHAT THAT IS IT'S A SCIENTIFIC SOT OF METHO THAT WE USE WHERE WE GATHER ALL THE INDIVIDUAL STIDIES AND WE PUT THEM IN A BIG BUCKET AND WE CAN AV DO THIS CAN A STATISTICAL FANCY SLIGHT OF HAND AND WE TRID TO COME UP WITH A BIG PICTURE OF WHAT ALL OF THES INDIVIDUALS THADIES TELL US AND WHAT THAT METRONALYSIS TOLD US IS THAT MELATONAN WILL ONLY INCREASE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SLEEP BY THREE POINT NINE MINUTES ON AVERAGE MINUTES MENIT AT IS PER CENT NOT AN IT WILL ONLY INCREASE YOUR SLEEP EFFICIENT SEEP BY TWO POINT TWO PER CENT SO IT RIDIS AS AS A THEY SAY IN UM CERTAIN BARDS OF CALIFORNS IT'S WEAK SAUCE AMANINAS ASOME IT THE SOURCE IS NOT STRONG THE FULSE IS NOT STRONG IN IN IN THIS WONT WHEN IT COMES TO HAT A TOOL THAT IN HEALTHY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT OF OLDER AGE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL NOW YOU KNOW RESULTS CAN VARY EVERY ONE IS DIFFENT OF COURSE SO WIT TALKING ABOUT THE AVERAGE THE SOCALD AVERAGE HUMAN ADULT HERE WELL MELATONAN AM IN DEFENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND ALSO I SHOULD MENTION I HAVE A COLLYGU ET STAMPFORD A JIMY'S ITESIR O ONCEFUL JUST T ICES LA BUT HARBARD MED WER ALSO TRAINED AND TRIFIC SLEEP RESEARCHURE AND ASKED HIM ABOUT MELETONAN AN USSENTIALLY SAID THE SAME THING THAT YOU JUST SAID WHICH IS VERY LITTLE IF ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT CAN IMPROVE SLEEP AND YET IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST I'M COMMONLY CONSUMED SO CALLED SLEEP IT HUNDREDS OF MENON DOLLARS INDUSTRY YES SO IT EITHER MASSIVE PLECISIBO O FACT OR ITS OPERATING THROUGH SOME OTHER MECHANISM RELATED TO QUELLING ANXIETY BROAS IT YA THAT'S IS ACHALLY INTERESTING YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME SIDIES WHERE YOU DO SEE SOME YOU KNOW EFFECTS NOW AGAIN WHEN YOU DO THE GRAND AVERAGE OF ULSE THADIES IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE AN EFFECT BUT LAT'S ASSEUME THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE IT DOES HAVE AN EFFECT THAT'S NOT AGAIN BEATST OF COMPLETELY DISMISSIVE EF THAT HOW COULD IT HAVE THAT EFFECT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'VE BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE BULLISH ON MELATONEIN FROM A SLEEP PERSPECTIVE AND THE MELATONEIN MORE GENERALLY FOR A I MAB BE CAN SPEAK ABOUT THIS TO AS A COUNTER MEASURE UNWHEN YOU'RE UNDER GOING IN SUFFICIENT SLEEP IM THERE ARE TOO ALL TO DIFFERENT ROOTS THAT THE FIRST REASON THAT I THINK IT COULD HAVE A SLEEP BENEFIT FOR SOME PEOPLE IS NOT BECAUSE IT HELPS IN THE GENERATION OF SLEEP WE KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T IT'S BECAUSE IT TOO SEEMS TO DROP COR BODY TEMPERATURE THERE IT ISN'T SO  AGAIND IM I'M FASCINING THESE DAYS MORE AND MORE BY TEMPERATURE AS AM IT BE NOT JUST A REA REFLECTION OF BRAIN STATE AND WAKEFULNESS AND IN SLEEP BUT ACTUALLY A LEVER THAT AS QUITE POWERFUL AND IT'S AND AND WITH ALL THE INTEREST IND ICE BAS AND HOTCHOURS AND SANAS ANSELF SOMETHING THAT WE WILL DEAFULLIN TOUCH ON AM TEMPERATURE VERIATION IS SO KEY SO IF IF MELATONAN IS DROPPING BODY TEMPERATURE BY A DEGREE OR SO SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE SAID BE OR CAN HELP INDUCE A SLEEPY STATE AH MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S ALOWIN PEOPLE TO GETTING THAT'S ONCS LOSS OILITY I I DON'T THINK MELETONE BY ITSELF WILL DROP IT BY ITST OF YOU KNOW AT A DEGREE SENTHINGIN OUR DEGREE SELSIUS AND FOR ORDIN IN US TO FOOL ASLEEP AND THEN STAY ASLEEP ACROSS THE NIGHT WE DO NEED TO DROP ORCORBODY TEMPERATURE BUY ABOUT ONE DEGREE SELSIUS OR ABOUT TWO TO THREE DEGREES A FARNHEIGHT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO FULL ASLEEP IN A ROOM THAT'S TOO COLD THAN TOO HOT AM I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE POTENTIAL AVENU THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING THINKING MORE DEEPLY ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO MELATONIAN AND THEN THE OTHER IS MELATONAN AS AN ANTIOXIDEN BUT LET'S I LET ME TABLE THAT FOR NOW CAUSE I'LL JUST GET A SIDETRACT THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT MELATON IN IN TIMES OF IT'S SUPPLEMENTATION BENEFIT OR LACK THEREOF TWO FINAL POINTS THAT I SHOULDN'T FORGET ONE IS THE ONLY POPULATION WHERE WE TYPICALLY SEE SOME BENEFIT AND IT OFTEN IS PRESCRIBED IS IN OLD REDULTS BECAUSE ALDER MEANING A SIXTY IN ALL THIS YES SIXTY SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER BECAUSE AS WE GET OLDER YOU CONTYPICALLY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED CALCIFICATION OF THE PENIAL GLAND WHICH MEANS THAT THAT GLAND THAT'S RELEASING MELETONIAN DOESN'T WORK AS WELL ANY MORE AS A CONSEQUENCE THEY TEND TO HAVE A FLATTER OVER ALL CAVE OF MELATONIAN RELEASE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT IT'S NOT THIS BEAUTIFUL LOVELY PEAK AND THIS BULL HON MESSAGE OF IT'S DARKNESS PLEASE GET TO SLEEP THAT'S WHY OLDREDULTS CAN HAVE PROBLEMS FOLLING ASLEEP OR STAYING SLEEP IT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON BY SUR ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BUT IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IN IT'S WHY MELETONE AND SUPPLEMENTATION IN THOSE COHORTS OLD REDULTS ESPECIALLY OLD REDULTS WITHIN SOMNIA PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AS MAYBE IN APPROPRIATE USE CASE WELL ON THOSE LINES AND IF WE WERE TO COMPARE DOSAGES A I DON'T DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH MELETONIAN ITS TYPICALLY RELEASED INTO THE BLOOD STREAM PER NIGHT AM AN CAN WE USE THAT AS A KIND OF A RULE OF THUMB BY WHICH TO COMPARE OF THE TYPICAL AMOUNT THAT SOMEONE WOULD SUPPLEMENT I BIGLY THE SUPPLEMENTS FOR MELETONE AN THAT I SEE A IN THE FARMERSEE AND ELSEWHERE AND ON LINE RANGE ANYWHERE FROM ONE MELEGRAM TO TWELVE OR EVEN TWENTY MELEGRAM YA MY GUES IS THAT A NORMAL NIGHTS RELEASE OF MELETONEAND TYPICAL FOR SOMEBODY IN THER TWENTYES THIRDIYS FOR ITIYS WOULD BE FAR LOWER THAN THAT AN I'S CORRECTOR WRONG YE IT'S IT'S A MANY MAGNITUDES LOWER AND THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT I SEE THAT TO I SEE YOU NOW TYPICAL DOSE IS AR YOU KNOW FIVE MELEGRAMS OR TEN MELEGRAMS AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A SUPPLEMENT COMPANY YOU KNOW PUTTING TEN MELEGRAMS VUS IS FIVE MELEGRAMS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ATUALLY DOING WHICH WE'LL SPEAK ABOUT PURITY AS WELL AN YOU IT'S CANOPH LIKE THE SUPER GULP SIZE NOBODY WANTS TO LOWER PRICE THEY JUST WANT YOU TO YOU KNOW WE'LL JUST GIVE YOU MORE FOR THE SAME PRICE AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL COMPETE SO IT'S BEEN THIS ESCALATING AUMS RACE OF MELETONE AND CONCENTRATION AND IT REALLY DOES NOT LOOK MEANING FUL FOR YOUN'T FORSLEEP IN ANYWAY WHAT WE VATUALLY FOUND IS THAT THE OPTIMAL DOSE IS FOR WHAY YOU DO GET SLEEP BENEFITS IN THE POPULATIONS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT A SOMEWER BETWEEN ZERO POINT ONE AND ZERO POINT THREE MELEGRAMS OF MELETONA IN OTHER WRDS THE TYPICAL DOSE IS A YOUSE THE TEN TIMES TWENTY TIMES MAY BE MORE THEN WHAT YOUR BODY WOULD NATURALLY EXPECT AND THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A SUPERA PHYSIOLOGICAL DOSE IN OTHER WORDS IT'S FAR ABOVE WHAT IS PHYSIOLOGICALLY NORMAL YOU NOWNT BUT THENY CONTIX IMAGINE I SAID TO YOU I WANT YOU TO EAT TWENTY TIMES AS MUCH FOOD TO DAY OTHOUGH YOU CAN USE TESTOSTRONAS EXAMPLE IU NO LET'S YOU'RE GING TO TAKE THREE HUNDRED TIMES THE NORMOL AMOUNT ED TO SUCH OR WE KNOW THAT WOULD HAVE A TONS OF DILATERIOUS OFFACTS VERY TERRIBLE AND YET YOU CAN DO THIS WHAT ONE THING THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT THESE SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL LEVELS OF MELATONE AND IS THAT A MANY YEARS AGO ASHALD HERE BERKLY WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE SOON WE WOULD INJECT ANIMALS WHICH WERE SEASONABLY BREEDING ANIMALS WITH MELATONAN AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WAS THAT THERE A GONADS EITHER THEIR TESTES OR OVERIS WOULD SHRINK MANY HUNDRED HUNDREDFOLD OR MORE A IN OTHER WORDS THAT THEY WOULD GO FROM HAVING AM NICE HEALTHY SIZED HAMPSER TTESTICLS WHAT A HAMPSTER WOULD CONSIDER HEALTHY SIZE AM FOR HAMPSTER AND THEY WOULD SHRINK TO THE SIZE OF A GRIN OF RICE SO FROM LIKE AN ALMONDS TO A GRAIN SIZE OF A GRAIN OF RICE I HAD TO SEE THAT ONLY ONCE FOR ME TO BE VERY CONCERNED AOUT SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL LEVELS OF MELATONAND AND I REALIZE THAT NELATONEAN DOES DIFFERENT THINGS INDIFFERENT SPECIES WE ARE NOT HAMPSTERS WE ARE NOT SEASONAL BREEDERS HOW SEASONLY RESTRICTED BREEDERS THERE MIGHT BE MORE BREEDING GURIN CERTAIN SEASONS I DO'T KOW THOSE DATA BUT NONE THE LESS HORMONES ARE POWERFUL AND AND SURE THERE IS AN OPTIMOL AND SOMETIMES A WE SEE THAT GOING SLIGHTLY ABOVE IN DOGINOUS LEVELS FOR CERTAIN HORMONES NOT ALWAYS CAN HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFACTS AND SOMETIMES IT CAN HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFACTS I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT TAKING HIGH LEVELS OF A HORMONE THAT HAS A FACTS ON THE REPRODOCTIVE AXUS AND THAT'S ONE OTHER REASONS WHY I GET VERY CONCERNED WHEN I SEE PEOPLE REALLY GETTING AGGRESSIVE ABOUT MELATONAN SUPPLEMENTATION TAKING A HUNDRED TEN FIVE HUNDRED SOMETIMES EVEN TEN THOUSAND TIMES THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD NORMALY RELEASE THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT NESTED IN ANY ONE SPECIFIC HUMAN STUDY I JU I JUST DON'T LIKE TO SEE I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE AND I DON'T WANT IT A PERSONALLY TAKE A HORMONE THAT'S KNOWN TO BE ANDROGEN SUPPRESSIVE AT HIGH LEVELS WHY WOULD I WHY WOULD I TAKE THAT I A THAT IMATION I ASKED MYSELF I THINK IT'S A VERY YOU KNOW GOOD POINT AND IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE EVIDENCE AROUND YOU KNOW MELETONANS LE THALITY IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT EXTREME FOR THE MOST PART YOU KNOW IT IT'S PRETTY SAFE THE YOU MEAN THE OTYOU CAN TAKE A LOT OF IT BEFORE YOU DIE RIGHT EXA YEBTHAT'S THAT'S A NO TOE OUW E OUTOTAY  BECAUSE YUKNOW YOU REALNEED TO THINK ABOUT YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR HEALTH NOT JUST WHETHER THE SURN IS GOING TO TO KILL YOU OR NOT AS THE DECISION MATE TRICKS THROUGH WHICH YOU PORIT A PUPAPILL AND IT COMES ON TO THIS CONCERN AROUND MELETONIA BECAUSE THEREWAS A STUDY I THINK IT'S ONE THAT YOU MENTION TOO WHE THEY LOOKED AT OVER I THINK IT WAS AT LEAST OF A TWENTY DIFFERENT BRANDS OF MELETONE AND SUPPLEMENTS AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT BASED ON WHAT IT SAD ON THE BUTTLE FUS IS WHAT WAS IN THE THE CAPTUALS THEMSELVES IT RANGED FROM I THINK IT WAS EIGHTY TREE PERCENT LAST THAN WHAT IT SAID ON THE BUTTLE TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT MORE THAN WHAT IT SAID ON THE BUTTLE NOW IF YOU IF THAT'S A TEN MILOGRAM YOU KNOW HILL AND IT'S FOR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT MORE THAN TEN MILOGRAMS AND WIL ALREADY AT TEN MILOGRAMS AT MANY TENS OF TIMES MORE THAN IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL RATHER THAN A SUPER PHYSIOLOGICAL DOSE I DO NEED TO BE A BIT THOUGHTFUL YE REMEMBER THOSE HAMSTERS A  WELL AN I DO APPRECIATE THE DEEP DIVE ON MELETONEUM BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S IT'S NEW ANTS IT'S A MATTER OF DOSAGES IN TIMING ET CETERA AND THEN IT MAY HAVE ITS PLACE AS YOU MENTION IN IN ALL THEIR INDIVIDUALS YEM AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT I'M AN AVID CONSUMER OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT I BELIEVE IN FOR ME AND I HAVE BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIMES I'M BY NO MEANS ANTI SUPPLEMENT ON SOME SUPPLEMENTS I REFUSE TO TAKE OR AVOID TAKING OTHERS I'M A QUITE AVIDLY TAKE AND OM ALONG THOSE LINES I PERSONALLY A AND I DON'T KNOW A WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS OR BUT AW THERE A FEW THINGS THAT I'VE PERSONALLY FOUND BENEFICIAL LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THEM AND I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU WOULD TELL ME THAT A EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT TO REFER TO IS PLACEBO THAT WOULD BE FINE SO A THAT'S WHAT WE DO WERE SCIENTISTS WE ARGUE AND THEN AND THEN WE ON WE REMAIN FRIENDS IN A AS AS A GO SO IM MAGNESIUM THERE'RE MANY FORMS OF MAGNESIOU MAGNESIUM CITRATE IS A AS WE KNOW AS A TERRIFIC LACATIVE A MAGNESIUM MALADE SEEMS AT LEAST FROM A FEW STUDIES SEEMS TO RELIEVE SOME OF DELAYED ON SET MUSCLE SORINESTS DOESN'T SEEM TO CREATE A KOND OF SEDATION TWO FORMS OF MAGNESIUM THAT I'M AWARE OF MAGNESIUM BY GLICENATE AN MAGNESIUM THREE INATE YE WE BELIEVE BASED ON THE DATA CAN MORE ACTIVELY CROSS THE BLUDBRING BARRIER SO YOU PUTIN YOUR GOT BUT SOME OF THAT MESI ON YOUR BRAIN NO WOULD HAVE THE SED OF EFFECT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTATION DO YOU SUPPLEMENT WITH MAGNESIUM AND OM WHAT WHAT STUDIES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE DONE IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DONE ALREADY SO I DON'T SUPPLEMENT WITH MAGNESIUM A BUT I DO THINK THREE AND EIGHT IS INTERESTINK BECAUSE OF THAT HIRE CAPACITY TO CROSS THE BLOOD BRAINBARRIER AND AGUALLY HAVE A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECT AND THE REASON THAT THAT INTERESTS ME IS BECAUSE THE SLEEP IS BY THE BRAIN OF THE BRAIN AND ALSO FOR THE BRAIN AS WELL AS FOR THE BODY WE JUST DON'T HAVE A PARTICULARLY GOOD SET OF STUDES THAT OF TARGETED EXCLUSIVELY THREE AND EIGHT WE DO HAVE LOTS OF STUDIES THAT OF JUST LOOKED AT MAGNESIUM IN GENERAL FOR SLEEP AND OVER ALL THE DATA IS UNCOMPELLING INTERUST AND FOR A WHILE I I WAS CONFUSEUS TO WHY WHERE DID THIS COME FROM THIS CAN OF MYTH OF MAGNESIUM SO I STARTED LOOKING BACK INTO THE LITERATURE AND I'VE BEST TRACED IT AT LEAST AS FAR AS I CAN TELL TO EARLY STUDY SHOWING THAT THOSE WHO WERE DEFICIENT IN MAGNESIUM ALSO HAD SLEEP PROBLEMS THEY HAD OTHER PROBLEMS TOO OF COURSE BUT SLEEP PROBLEMS WERE ONE OF THAT SET OF SIQUALI THAT CAME FROM HAVING LOWER MAGNESIUM AND WHEN THEY SUPPLEMENTED WITH MAGNESIUM AND TRID TO RESTORE THOSE LEVELS SOME OF THOSE SLEEP PROBLEMS DISSIPATED AND THEN THAT SEEMS TO HAVE GOT LOST IN SAND OF SOME GAME OF LIKE WHISPERS AROUND THE ROOM AND IT'S BECOME TRANSLATED INTO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE SLEEP PROBLEMS WHO ARE HEALTHY SLEEPERS AND WHO ARE HEALTHY IN GENERAL AND YOU HAVE HEALTHY NORMAL LEVELS OF MAGNSIUM IF THEY TAKE MORE MAGNESIUM THEY WILL SLEEP BETTER AND THE DATA REALLY THERE IT'S NOT A GOOD ONCE AGAIN THE ONLY STUDY THAT I'VE SEEM WHERE MAGNESIUM DID HAVE SOME EFFICACE WAS IN A STUDY WITH OLD REDULTS I THINK THEY WERE SIXTY TO EITY IS OLD IT MAY HAVE BEEN EXCLUSIVELY WOMEN NOW I THINK ABOUT IT AND THEY ALSO HAD INSOMNIA AND IN THAT POPULATION YOU DID SEE SOME BENEFITS AND MY GUESS IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S AN OLDER COMMUNITY IS WELL THEY WERE PROBABLY PROBABLY DEFICIENT IN MAGNESIUM SO THEY FIT THE FORMER CAT AGREE OF SIMPLY WHEN YOUR DEFICIENT AND YOU RESTORE YOU CAN HELP SLEEP SOID RETURN TO NORMAL BUT IF YOU ARE NOT DEFICIENT AND YOURE HEALTHY ING YOU NOT OLDING YOU DON'T HAVE IN SOMNIA AND YOUR SUPPLEMENTING THINKING THAT IT PROVIDE SLEEP RIGHT NOW THE DATA ISN'T SUPPORTIVE EF THAT BUT I JUST DON'T THINK WE HAVE AN AUTHREE AND ETE DATA TO ACTUALLY SPEAK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT COULD JUST BE A BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER ISSUE SO FAR WITH THE OTHER FORMS SO MAYBES SOME ADDITIONAL STUDIES LOOKING SPECILIAALY AT THREE IN ATOR BY GLYCENATE WOULD BE WOULD MEDLESTE  MAGNESIUMS INVOLVEDAN SO MANY SELLER PROCESSES YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS A FACT IF IT TRULY EXIST IS AS WE SAY INSINES IN THE NOISE MEANING IT'S IN THE IT'S IN THE THE GIDDER OF THE DATA BUT TO ISOLATE THE REAL EFFACT ONE NEEDS TO DO SOME MORE REFINED STUDIES AM WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE OF THE INTEREST TO YOU IF NOT THINGS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO TAKE AM I THESE ARE NOT THINGSTHAT I PERSONALLY TAKE MOST BECAUSE I'E JUST HAVE NAN EXPERIMENTED WITH THEM A VOLARIAN ROOT AH IS ONE AM TART CHERRY AND KEEWY FRUIT TELL ME ABOUT TELL ME ABOUT VALARIAN ROUT TART CHERRY AND KEEWE FRUIT THIS IS NEW TO ME AM A HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD OF THEM AND AM TARTCHERRYAND KEEWE SONS DELICIOUS ABUT WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH VALARIAN ROUT TART CHERRY AND KEEWE AND ARE WE TALKING ABOUT EATING TART CHERRIES AND KEEWEES AND VALARIAN ROUT E WHY YET I NOT TAKING THEM IN BILLFOR USUALLY IT SUPPLEMENTS BUT IT'S ALSO BOTH FOR TART CHERRIES AND FOR KEEWEES INS THE ATUAL YOU KNONT FRUIT THEMSELVES VALARIAN OFTEN TOUTED AS A BENEFICIAL SLEEP AID AND LOTS OF PEOPLE SWAR BY IT TO BUT THE EVIDENCE IS AT SEE QUITE AGAINS THOU REALLY NOT THAT IT MAKES YOUR SLEEP WORSE BUT OF AT LEAST THE SEVEN GOOD STUDIES THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND AND TYPICALLY THESE ARE OF THE NATURE OF WHAT WE CALL A RANDOMIE PLESEEBO CROSSOVER DESINE AND I WON'T BOLL PEOPLE WITH WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S ST OF WON OF STUDY SOLID YIS ONE OF THE SERT OF GOLD STANDID METHODS THAT WE HAVE WEN WERE LOOKING AT INT TO VENTIONS THATY SUCH AS STRUKS TITIES FIVE OF THE SEVEN FOUND NO BENEFIT AOF VALARIAN ROUT ON SLEEP THEN TOO OUT OF THE SEVEN THE DATA WAS JUST INSUFFICIENT I THINK IT WAS A POWER ISSUE WHERE THEY JUST COULDN'T MAKE ANY STRONG CONCLUSIONS AND THEN I THINK THERE WAS THE MOST RECENT AM STUDY I THINK LOOKED AT TOO DIFFERENT DOSES OF VALARIAN I COULD HAVE THIS WRONG AND THEY JUST FAIL TO FIND ANY EFFECTS ONCE AGAIN BUT THE STONING PART OF THAT PAPER AS I RECALL THEY HAVE THIS BIG TABLE WITH ALL F THE DIFFERENT SLEEP MATRICTS THAT THEY LOOKED AT AND THEY WERE WELL OVER TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY TRIED TO SEE IF VALARIAN IMPACT IT AND NONE OF THEM WERE SIGNIFICANT WHICH STUNS ME BECAUSE FROM STATISTICAL PROBABILITIES WE KNOW IF YOU JUST RANDOMLY PERFORM TWENTY FIVE STATISTICAL TESTS CHANCES ARE PROBABLISTICALLY YOU'LL JUST GET WAND SIGNIFFICANT RESULT BY RANDOM CHANCE AND EVEN WITH RANDOM CHANS ON THEIR SIDE THEY STILL COULDN'T FIND A BENEFIT OF A A VALARIAN SO SO VALARIAN ROUT MIGHT BE WORSE THAN NOTHING AT AL IF THERE IS A SO TO SPEAK AE AGAIN PLECERO EFFECT WE ONT WE CAN THINK ABOUT THAT TWO AND I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU FEEL AS THOUGH IT'S HAVING A BENEFIT FOR YOU AND WITH ALL THE CAVIATS THAT WE HAVE WITH SUPPLEMENTS THINKS LIKE MELETONE AN PURITY CONCENTRATION ET  CETERA YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S NO HARM NO FOUL BUT I'M NOT A A YOU KNOW A MEDICAL DOCTORANA I DON'T TELL ANY ONE ABOUT WE HAVE ALL O THESE DISCLAIMIS ABOUT NOT RECKOAN WELL INCLUDE THESE G THEN OW WE SAY YOU KNOW WERE NOT PHYSICIANS WE DON'T PRESCRIBE ANYTHING WERE SIGNED TO SOME PROFESSORS WE PROFESS THINGS  OT IT A POBL TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH AM TO NOT JUST TO PROTECT US BUT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AM I DO ON IT HERE ABOUT TART CHERRY YAWE FRUIT AM WHAT WHAT'S THE STORIES AR TRANGE AS N IT I WAS YOU KNOW I I'M CAN OF A HARD NO SCIENTIST AND WHEN PEOPLE YOU KNOW SOME YEARS AT GOES TUT AT SAYING OW TART CHERRIES ITS THING OR KEYWEE FRUITS I WAS THINKING I GAN THIS THE SOUNDS A BEEN CALIFORNS AN O TO OU YE I KNOW HA THE SUN HAS SUFTENED ME AS TEM BUT I THOUGHT THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO AS SCIENTISTS IS BE AS OPEN MINDED AS POSSIBLE AND I SHOULD NOT BE SO QUICK TO DISMISS SO I WHEN TO THE LITERJUST JUST STARTED READING AS MUCH AS I COULD ABOUT IT AND THERE WERE THREE REALLY GOOD RANDOMISE PLESEE BO CROSS OVER TRIALS WITH TART CHERRIES AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT IN ONE STUDY IT REJUICED THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU SPENT AWAKE AT NIGHT BY OVER AN HOUR AND THEN THE OTHER TWO STUDIES ONE OF THEM FOUND THAT IT INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP THAT YOU GOT BY THIRTY FOUR MINUTES THE OTHER IT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP THAT YOU GOT BY EIGHTY FOUR MINUTES ARE WHICH YOU KNOW THESE ARE AND WHAT STRIKING IS THAT THEY WERE INDEPENDENT AT STUDIES ITHER THINK MEANING THAT THEY WERE FROM INDEPENDENT GROUPS AND THESE WERE YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE GUIS YOUN I IN GELLS I KNOW PRETTY WELL YOU KNOW AN REALLY KNOW IN TRUST THERE WERE RIGHT I REALLY TRUST THER WERE TOLY IN JUSTING ACTUAL TARTCHERRIES OF THE DRINKING THE JUICE OR IN CAPSAL IT WAS JUCE SO THEY IN ALL THREE STUDIES IT WAS JUICE AND ALTHOUGH YOU CAN I THINK AS A SUPPLEMENT YOU CAN BUY IT IN A CAPSUE HN WE'VE GOT NO IDEA WHETHER THAT CHANGEUS THE BENEFIT OR NOT WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING IN I THINK IT WAS THAT LAST TUDY WHERE THEY GOT IN INCREASE IN SLEEP BY EIGHTY FOUR MINUTES IT ALSO DECREASED DAYTIME NAPPING SIGNIFICANT AND THAT'S ONE THAT I COULD CERTAINLY MAKE USEU LATO I I LOVE YOU  SIT OF TOW YOU KNOWS BUT I THUSLY SKIPED THEM TO RIGHT AND AND WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT NAPS AND SUCH A THE UPSIDE AND DOWNSIDE OF THAT WHICH THEN MADE ME THINK WELL IF THAT'S THE CASE MAY BE THE NET NET BENEFIT ON SLEEP OVER ALL IS NO DIFFERENT IT'S JUST THAT IT DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE TAKING TO SLEEP DURING THE DAY AND GIVING IT BACK TO THE NIGHT BUT THAT WASN'T THE CASE AS IF YOU ADDED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SLEEP THAT THEY WERE GETTING WITHOUT TART CHERRIES BOTH NAPS AND NIGHTLY SLEEP COMBINED STILL WHEN YOU TOOK TART CHERRIES YOU STILL GOT A NET SOME BENEFIT NONTROCITIAL AMOUNT OF SLEEP SO YOU KNOW SO FAR WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPLEMENTS AND THOSE TYPES OF STUDIES THE GOOD STUDIES AND THE DATA LOOKS INTERESTING BUT AS A DRUG ITSELF YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS CLINICAL DRUG UKNOW THREE STUDIES THAT ARE SOMEWHAT SMALL IN NATURE AND HAVE SOME POSITIVE BENEFIT THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD CALL PRELIMINARY DATA OF MAYBE A CHIN SCRATCHING KIND SO YAND IS GENN ON THE MARGIANS FOR SAFETY ONE MIGHT THINK WELL GIVEN THEN IT'S A TART CHERRY AS U PUS TO SOME FORMER SUITABLE UNION PRESCRIPTION FOR THAN AND YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE THEIR THRUSHOLD TO EXPERIMENT WAS SUPPLEMENTS IS QUITE LOW SOME PEOPLE THEIR THRESHOLD IS QUITE I I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THE'RE TWO CATEGORIES OR AT LEAST TWO CATEGORIES OF FOLKS OUT THERE PEOPLE WHO HERE O TARTCHERRY CAN IMPROVE SLEEP AND WILL RUN OUT AND TRY IT AND PEOPLE WHO HEARE WELL THATS SOUNDS CRAZY WHY WOULD I DO THAT AM BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT TARTCHERRY ISN'T REALLY WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT PRESUMABLY IF THIS IS A REAL AFFACT AND SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE THAT THERE'S A COMPOUND IN TART CHERRY INSRY THAT IF WE WERE TO CALL IT WHATEVER WHATEER FIVE ALPHIS IX YOU KNOW SOME MOLECULE IF WE REFERRED TO IT BY TS TECHNICAL NAME THEN PEOPLE SAY O THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY INTERESTING TECHNICAL WAY TO APPROACH SLEEP BUT DOESN'T SOUND VERY NATURAL SO BOTH GRIPS OR LITTLE BIT AM MISGUIDED I IN ACENSE THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT EVERYTHING THAT COMES FROM NATURALLY OCCURRING FOODS PLANTS IT SET ORO THINGS THAT GRW OF THE GROUND THAT THAT'S ALL SAFE THAT'S NOT TRUE AND PEOPLE THAT THINK THAT FORMA SUTACLES ARE THE ON IF IT'S NOT EVIDENCE WITH THE PURIFIED MOLECULE THAN SOMETHING'S NOT OF UTILITY WITL THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT TRUE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE I THINK LIES THE ANSWER WHICH IS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE TARTCHERRIES AT LEAST AN INTRIGUING POTENTIAL SLEEP AT INTRIGUING POTENTIAL SLEEP AD AND I'M UNDER SCORING POTENTIA AM I'V CERTAINLY INTRIGUE BY IT TO THE POINT WHERE I I MIGHT EXPERIMENT A BIT BUT I'M AN EXPERIMENTOR FOR MYSELF AM BEFORE I A ASK YOU ABOUT KEEWE I'VE HAD QUITE GOOD RESULTS FROM TAKING SOMETHING ALLED APIGENAN WHICH IS A DERIVATIVE OF CAMOMILE BUT IN SUPPLEMENT FORM I THING I TAKE FIFTY MELEGRAMS ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE SLEEP AND I SUBJECTIVELY EXPERIENCE A I BETTER NIGHT SLEEP SO IS  BEAU I DON'T MEASURE I HA CONFESS I DON'T MEASURE MY SLEEP I'M NOT A SLEEP TRACT ANY I AM BUT I YOU KOW THERE A FEW PAPERS OUT THERE THEY'RE NOT WHAT WE WILD CALL BLUE PUBLISHD IN BLUE RIBBON JOURNALS BUT THEY HAVE CONTROL GROUPS AND IN IT LOOK SOMEWHAT INTERESTING AND THE'RE WHEN I SAY APOGENAN A PEOPLE GET SOMEWHAT INTRIGTALE WITH A MOLECUE CEMOMILE HAS LONG BEEN FHOUGHT TO BE A SETATIVE A MILD SETITIVE BUT A SEDATIVE A YOU DRINK CAMOMILE TE DO YOU TAKE APIGENAN AN WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON APOGUV YET I I DON'T AND I I HAVE LOOKED INTO SOME OF THE DAYS A REGARDING SLEEP AS WELL RIGHT NOW FROM BEST I CAN TELL IT'S IT'S MOSTLY SUBJECTIVE TATS AR OF THAN OBJECTIVE HAD SAIT OF SLEEP METSHES AND THAT'S WHI RIGHT NOW I YOU KNOW I SIT OF UNCLEA NOT NO COMMENT BUT JUST AN CLEA NOT DISMISSING IT BECAUSE I THINK YOU AND I BOTH ASCRI TO THE IDEA OF ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE SO KEEP YOUR MIND OPEN AT LEAST I TELLIT TO MYSELF A I THINK IF YOU'LL FINDING A BENEFIT AND YOU CAN DO WHAT I WOULD THINK OF IF I WAS PERSONLY EXPERIMENTING WHICHIS BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE POTS OF THE EXPERIMENT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS U LET'S SAY THAT I NOW WANT TO YOU THINK ABOUT SOME KIND OF A SLEEP SUPPLEMENT I WILL TAKE SOME KIND OF BASE LIND SET OF RECORDINGS FOR MONTH AND IILL JUST GAUGE WHERE I'MAT SET OF SUPPLEMENT FREE THEN I'LL GO ON FOR A MONTH TO WHATEVER I'M THINKING OF OF TAKING AN I DON'T YOU KNOW SUPPLEMENT BUT LET'S SAY THAT I WANT TO AND I EXPERIMENT WITH THAT AN I FEEL AS THOUGH BASED ON MY METRICS BE THEM OBJECTIVE FROM MY OR A RING WILL BE THEM SUBJECTIVE FROM WHATEVER I'M YOU KNOW RITING DOWN IN THE MORNING AND BOTH ARE IMPORTANT VALID SUBJECTIVE AN OBJECTIVE WE LIKE BOTH IN THE SLEEP WORLD AND I THINK OCA LOOK IT'S CLEARLY THAT THE IT SEEMS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF AN EFFECT THE KEY THING HOWEVER IS THEN DO THE NEGATIVE EXPERIMENT WHICH IS NOW COME OFF IT FOR ANOTHER MONTH AND SEE TO THINGS GET WORSE AND IF I CAN SEE THAT BY DIRECTIONALITY THEN I'M STARTING TO THINK MAYBE I'M BELIEVING THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE SO THAT'S THE WAY I WOULD OF TYPICALLY APPROACH YOU KNOW A SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMENT IF I WERE TO DO IT AND THAT'S JUST ME THAT'S JUST THE WAY MY MIND WORKS BUT NO THAT'S GREAT ITHTHING IT'S VERY VERY SCIENTIFIC AND ORGANIZED IN A WAY THAT ALOWS ARE YOU AND AND WOULD ALLOW OTHER PEOPLE TO MAKE VERY INFORM DECISION FOR THEMSELVES AM I LIKE THAT I NOM I LIKE TO THINK IN TERMS OF OF MANIPULATING ANY ASPECT OF ARBIOLOGY THAT BEHAVIOURAL TOOLS ALWAYS ARE THE FIRST LINE OF ENTRY THEN NUTRITION EVERYONE AS THE SOONER OR LATER EVEN IF YOU'R FASTING THEN PERHAPS SUPPLEMENTATION THEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THEN PERHAPS BRAIN MACHINE IN HER FACE DEVICES THAT USE O INDUCE SOMETHING AND THOSE CAN BE DONE IN COMMINATION BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME IS WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE I SAY WHAT WHAT SHOULD I TAKE WITHOUT THINGING ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOUR THEIR LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR ET CETERA BUT OF COURSE THESE THINGS WORK IN COMMINATION AN I THINK IT'S YOU RIGHT THAT THE'S MANY WHEN IT COMES TO SLEEP THERE ARE MANY LOW HANGING FRUITS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE YOU TO YOU KNOW PUT SAT OF EXOGINIUS MOLECULES IN OTHER WAYE THINGS LIKE SUPPLEMENTS INTO YOUR BODY OR YOU KNOW USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRUGS TO HELP YOU GET THE NOW WHEN IT COMES TO PRESCRIPTION SLEEP ADES I THINK I'VE BEEN AGAIN A LITTLE BIT TO FORTHRIGHT WE KNOWING CLENICAL PRACTICE THAT THE MAYBE A TIME AN A PLACE FOR THINGS LIKE SLEEPING PILLS THEY ARE A SHORT TIME SOLUTION TO CERTAIN FORMS OF INSOMNIA BUT THEY ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THE LONG TIME AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER WAYS THAT YOU CAN GET A SLEEP I'M HELP OR YOUCAN GET ASLEEP CURATIVE PROFILE FROM THINGS LIKE COGNATIVE BEHAVRAL THERAPE FOR INSOMENE WHICH IS A NON DRUG APPROACH A PSYCHEL AND QUITE EFFECTIVE FROM ONE I VERY JUST AS GOODVO SLEEPING PILLS GREAT DATA MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG TIME THERESE A RECENTS THAT HE PUBLISHED THAT AFTER WORKING WITH THAT THERAPIST SOME OF THE BENEFIST LASTED ALMOST DACCADE YOU KNOW NOW IF YOU STOP SLEEPING PILLS USUALLY YOU HAVE REBOUND IN SOMMNIA WAY OF SLEEP GOES BACK TO BEING JUST AST BAD IF NOT WER S AND I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO IMPLEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO SLEEP THAT DON'T REQUIRE VENTURING OUT INTO THOSE WATERS AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT HERE TO TELL ANY ONE ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD VENTURE OR NOT THAT'S COMPLETELY YOUR CHOICE WHAL I'M SAYING IS THAT IF YOU ONE TO THINK ABOUT OPTIMIZING YOUR SLEEP THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO IT THAT DON'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE YOU TO SWALLOW ANYTHING OR INJECT ANYTHING OR YOU NOW SMOKE ANYTHING OR O YOWACE THE MARGINS OF SAVETY ARE QUITE QUITE WHY RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S THE OTHER ONE YESRI SO JUST BE O LOWHANGING FRUIT A OROR HOWA HANGS REALITY BUT WHAT WHAT ABOUT KYWE THEY'RE DELICIOUS TO ME ANYWAY YA THE HUMBLE KEY WE FRUIT A NAME NOT A SHOULDN'T BE MISTAKEN FOR THE THE THE AM FLIGHTLESS BUD OF A YOU ZEALAND WHICH IS THE NATIVE BID THAT WERE TOOKING ABOUT THE KEY WE THE FRUITERE WHICH A THOSE TREES AND SHRUBS ARE A MOSTLY A SOUTH EAST ASIA KEY WE FRUITS HAVE BEENG PREVIOUSLY TOUTID AS POTENTIALLY HAVING ASLEEP BENEFIT WHICH AGAIN GOT ME CURIOUS ANIGHT AT FIRST THREUG IT OUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THIS READY ONLY ONE PUBLISHED HUMANS THATY THAT'S OF ANY VALUE BUT WHAT THEY DID FIND WAS THAT IT DECREASED THE SPEED OF TIME WITH WHICH IT TOOK YOU TO FALL ASLEEP THES AE REA INJUSTING THE HOWKEWE SO IT'S INJESTING THE WHOLE CLEEP LE SKIN I YES GIN PEE THE SCRINGE WHEN THEY SEE ME WELL I O THE ONLY THERE'S NO NO NO I THINK THE IDEA IS SOME OF THE GOOD STUFF AND OUT COME ON TO THIS MAY ACTUALLY BE IN THE SKINNINSELF THANK YOU YOU AS YOU YOU ARE JUST WHAT YOU JUST HELP ME WHEN OF THAT I'LL GIVE YOU O KA OKA  A PAMULAT BY THE WAY THIS SKIN IS USE AN THEN A O JUS TO TAS I THAT'S AR EWENTS NO HE DID NOT A SO THE SKIN SEEMS TO BE PART OFF THIS POTENTIAL SLEEP EQUATION AND THAT'S THATY YET THE AM YOU FELL ASLEEP FASTER AND YOU STAYD TO SLEEP FOR LONGER AND YOU SPENT LESS TIME AWAKE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND I JUST THOUHT WELE YOU KNOW THAT'S ONCE THADY WHAT CAN EAREALY DO WITH THAT THERE IS ANOTHER STADY HOWEVER IN AN ANIMAL MODEL WHICH IS YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING AND ONCE AGAIN THEY FOUND A VERY SIMILAR FENA TYPE THAT THE RATS I SAY THEY WERE MICE THE MICE FELL ASLEEP FASTER AND THEY ALSO SPENT LONGER TIME IN SLEEP THE SLEEP JURATION ALSO INCREASE WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING MECHANISTICALLY AND THIS IS NOT THE MECHANISM THAT I THINK TIE TOGETHE TART CHERRIES KEY WE FRUT T AND YOU NOTHINKS LIKE MELATONAN CAUSE I THINK THERE COULD BE ONE COMMON BINDING A MECHANISM WHAT THEY FOUND IN THE ANIMAL STUADY IS THAT THEY COULD BLOCK THOSE KEY WE FRUIT SLEEP BENEFITS USING A GABBA BLOCKING AGENT NOW GABBA A GABBA AT WHICH IS STANDS FOR GAMMA AMENIO BUTERIC ACID HERE'S ONE OF THE MAJOR INHIBOTORY YOUR A TRANSMITTERS OF THE BRAIN IT'S CANNOT LAKE A GA ALICERING SAIDITIVE I A SORT OF GETS IT ACCOUNT OF THE RED LIGHT ON THE TRAFFIC LIGHT SIGNAL YOU KNOW IM OTHERS ARE GREEN LIGHT IM GABBER IS RED LIGHT SO BY PLAYING AROUND WITH SOME SORT OF CLEVER DRUGS TOMANICULATE THE SYSTEM THEY COULD PREVENT THE BENEFIT OF THE KEY WE FRUIT BY SIT OF BUGGERING ARAUN WITH THE GABBA RECEPTAV MEANING THAT PERHAPS PART OF THE KEY WE FRUIT BENEFIT ON SLEEP WAS MEDIATED BY THE BRAINS NATURAL INHIBOTRY YOUR TRANSMITS A SYSTEM CALED THE GABA SUST IPSIDE AND I THOUGHT THAT THIT WAS THAT WAS KAND OF THAT CONVINCE ME A LITTLE BEMORE THAT MAYBE THE SOMETHING HERE TO READ INTO SO TO BE DETERMINED AGAIN HERE IS THE BANA BUT YOU KNOW TAUGHT CHERRIES AND KEYWE FRUITS THE DAYSA SURPRISE ME BECAUSE IN PAT I WAS SO PREOCCUPIED WET BEING YOU KNOW AN  A BIT PURISHABAT IN A BIT SNOBBY THINKING NOT COME ON THAT'S DEFFENY NO KANOWAK WELL I CAS OF CARMOUNDS I LOOK FOR TO A DAY WHEN SUPPLEMENTS ARE NO LONGER CALLED SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER NOT SOMETHING HAS AN EFFECT WHETHER NOT IT'S A WHOLE KEYWE FRUIT OR A DIRIVET OF KEYW FRUIT WILL DEPEND ON THE MOLECULAR COMPOUND AND AS YOU MENTION THIS AM POTENTIAL MECHANISM VIA THE GABA SYSTEM AM THAT'S I THAT WE BOTH AS SCIENTIST GET EXCITED ABOUT MECHANISM CAUSE WHEN YOU CAN ISE A MECHANISM AND PATHWAY PROVIDES A RATIONALA GROUNDING FOR WHY KEY WEE OF ALL THINGS OR TARTCHERY OF ALL THINGS MIGHT HELP A INCREASED TOTAL SLEEP TIME A I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION OR ASK ABOUT TRIPTOPAN AND SERATONAN I CAN AN TOTALLY SAY WHEN I'VE TAKEN TRIP TO FAN THE PRECERSIR TO SERATONAN OR SRATONAN ITSELF I HAVE A HORANDIS NIGHT SLEEP I FALL ASLEEP VERY EASILY AND I EXPERIENCE RIDICULOUSLY VIVID DREAMS NEITHER PLEASANT NOR UNPLEASANT AS KIND OF A MISSMASH AND THEN I WAKE UP AND I EXPERIENCE SEVERAL DAYS OF INSOMNIA THAT AND I'VE DONE THE THE PAS IF CONTROL IN THE NEGATIVE CONTROL AT ALL THE VARIATIONS THEREOF TO CONFIRM THAT AT LEAST FOR ME SUPPLEMENTING WITH SERATONERGIC AGENTS IS A BAD IDEA FOR ME M AND AM TRIPTOPAN IS A COMMON SLEEP SUPPLEMENT AND SLEEP AID THAT THAT'S DISCUSSED UM THE NORMAL ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP INVOLVES THE RELEASE OF SARATONA BUT IN A VERY TIMED AND REGULATED WAY WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT SERATONAN IN SLEP OF YE ODTOCAN A PUT THAT INTO A NUTSHELL AND THEN WHY SUPPLEMENTING SUP WITH SARATONAN AND OR ITS PRECURSOR A TRIP TO PAN MIGHT BE A GOOD OR A BAD IDEA FOR SOMEBODY I THINK ONE OF THE POTENTIAL DANGES IS THAT BASTD ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY THAT CAN CHANGE THE ABSORPTION OF NATURAL TO OF TRIPTOPHAN AND SERATONAN UPTAKE WITHIN THE BRAIN ITSELF SO I'M ALWAYS THOUGHTFUL WHEN YOU'R PLAYING ARAN WITH THAT MOTHER NATURE DYNAMIC AS IT WERE THE DATA AS YOU DESCRIBED AS A LITTLE BIT ALL OVER THEM AP SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT KNOCKS THEM OUT OTHER PEOPLE SAY JUST LIKE YOU DO IT HAS A TERRIBLE IMPACT ON MY SLEEP AND WHEN I STAP IT'S PRETTY BAD FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND SEEMS TO HAVE THIS LINGERING AFTER E FACT IF THINK WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING HERE IS WE NEED SERATONAN TO JUST AS YOU DESCRIBED TO BE MODULATED IN VERY SPECIFIC WAYS DURING THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEEP IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRING OF THE A'M BRAIN EPY CENTERS WERE SERATONAN IN IS RELEASE THAN THERE'S A BUNCH OF THEM IN THE BRAIN STEM WHAT YOU FIND AND THE RELEASE OF OF OF A SERATONIN TOO WHEN WE'RE AWAKE IT'S USUALLY IN HIGH CONCENTRATIONS AS WE START TO DRIFT OFF TO SLEEP IT LOWERS SOME BUT NOT NECESSARILY DRAMATICALLY AS WE GOING INTO NONREM SLEEP BUT THEN WHEN WE GO IN TO REM SLEEP SERATONIN IS SHUT OFF THE OTHER ONE OF THE OTHER NOR AMODULATORS NORA DRANALIN ALSO SHUT OFF REMSLEEP IS THE ONLY TIME DURING THE TWENTY FOR OUR PERIOD WHERE WE SEE NORADRANALIN AND SERATONAN OR NORAPINEFFRAN COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN WHEN I SAY SERATONAN WORLS ARE TALKING FIVE ACH TEEP P STRIKE FIVE AH TEA THAT'S JUST ITS CHEMICAL A NAME HERE SO AM WHETHER IT ULD SPEAKING ABOUT SERATONE OR FIVE ACH TEAS THE SAME THING NOR APANEFRAN NORADRANALIN BOTH OF THOSE NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN FOR YOU TO PRODUCE REM SLEEP THE OTHER ONE OF THE OTHER NOUR AMODULATORS THAT THEN RAMPS UP TO PRODUCE REM SLEEP IS ACATILE COLY SO THESE THREE NOURAMODULATORS HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE RECIPROCAL DAMS THAT THEY HAVE FOR YOU TO GENERATE WHAT IS CALLED AND NATURAL ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT IT'S THE PUSHPULL AGAIN IT'S A PUSHPULL AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S CHEST TEM BACK IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THINK OF THE THAT'S WHY I THINK IF YOU'RE TRYING TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY DRIVE UP YOUR SERATONAN LEVELS AT NIGHT AND THAT SUSTAINS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET INTO REM SLEEP YOU COULD BE ARTIFICIALLY FRAGMENTING REMSLEEP NOW I DON'T KNOW THE DATA I DON'T THINK ANY ONE'S REALLY GOT NOW DATA IVEDONIT WHY I WOULD BE YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE TO SAY MAT TWO YEARS TIME THAT'S THE DATO HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL MECHANISM OR LET'S DESIGN SOME EXPERIMENTS WHERE WOULD YOU GO FIRST I WOULD SAY LET'S LOOK AT THE DESRRUPTION OF REM SLEEP NONREM SLEEP RECIPRICAL REGULATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU NEED SERATONIN TO BE YOU KNOW UP AT ONE TIME DOWN AT ANOTHER SO AI I AM AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID AND I'M AM I'M PERSONALLY NEVER TAKING TRIP TO VENAR SERATONAND AGAIN UNLESS THERE'E SOME CLENICAL REASON FOR THAT I THAT NON NEED TO DO THAT I WANT A ASK ABOUT ON SOME OTHER PRO SLEEP BEHAVIORS BUT BEFORE I DO NAP LET'S TALK ABOUT NAPS I LOVE NAPS I COME FROM A LONG HISTORY OF NAPPERS AMY DAD ALWAYS TOOK A NAP IN THE AFTERNOON I TAKE A TWENTY OR THIRTY MINUTE NAP OR I DO A PRACTICES WHACH I AM TOOK THE LIBERTY OF QINTING ANDEST AR NON SLEEP DY BRASS SOME SORT OF JUST PASSIVE LAYING ORTY NOW THERE FEET UP ELEVATED SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO YOU WERE I'LL DO YOGANEDRI'LL DO HYPNOSIS OR SOMETHING THAT SORT BUT TWENTY OR THIRTY MINUTES OF THAT HAS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL FOR ME TO GET UP FROM NAT NAP OR PERIOD OF O MINAMILL WAKEFULNESS WILL CALL IT AND GO ABOUT MY DAY QUITE WELL AND ALSO FALL ASLEEP JUST FINE WHAT ER THE DATE U ON NAPS A DO YOU NAP AND WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT KEEPING NAP SHORT MEANING TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTES VERSES GETTING OUT PAST NINETY MINUTES TWO HOURS SO A FOR YOU PERSONALLY NAPS YE NAY OR  I DON'T NAP AM AND I'VE JUST NEVER BEEN A HABITUAL NAPA IS THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL SLEEPY IN THE AFTERNOON OR DICA SLEEP DON'T FEEL ASLEEPY YOU'RE JUST HARDIER THAN I'M I WOULDN'T SAY HAUDIE I MAY BE AM LESS CAPABLE OF FULLING A SLEEP A BUT GI NOT THE RA RY AFTERNOON NO NO I DON'T DRAG  DON'T NAP BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL A A MEE TO NAP THAT'S RIGHT YAP NOW IT'S NOT THAT I AM IMMUNE TO WHAT WE CALL THE POSTPRANDIAL DIP IN ELUTNESS I DEFINITELY FEEL AS THOUGH THAT CAN BE THIS CANNO AFTERNAL AFTERNOON LULL WA YOU KNO I'M NOT QUITE AS ON AS I WAS AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WE KNOW THE PHYSIOLOGY TO THAT WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO WHETHER WE WOULD DESIGN TO NAP SO FOR NAPS WE'VE DONE LOTS OF DIFFERENT STUDIES AND OTHE COLLEAGUES OF DONE THESE THATIES TWO NAPS CAN HAVE SOME RIDDY GREAT BENEFITS WE'VE FOUND BENEFITS FOR CODYOVESCULAR HEALTH BLOPRESSIA FOR EXAMPLE WE' FOUND BENEFITS FOR LEVELS OF COURTS US ALL WEVE FOUND BENEFITS FOR LEARNING IN MEMORY AND ALSO EMOTIONAL REGULATION HOW LONG ARE THE NAPS TYPICALLY IN THOSE STUDIES ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY MINUTES TO NIGHTY MINUTES SOMETIMES WE LIKE TO USE A NIGHTY MINUTE WINDOW SO THAT THE POTIS BUT CAN HAVE A FULL CYCLE OF SLEEP AND THEREFORE THEY GET BOTH NONREM AND REM SLEEP WITHIN THAT TIME PRIOT THAN WHEN WE WAKE THEM UP WE USUALLY WAIT A PERIOD OF TIME TO GET THEM PAST WHAT WE CALL SLEEP IN NASHA WHICH IS THAT KIND OF WINDOW OF GROGGINESS WAY YOU SAY TO YOU BET'S TA HOFF LOOK YOUNEF DAWLING PLEASE DON'T SPEAK TO ME FOR THE FI HOUR NATHIN IV DON'T ANYTHING RIGHT NOW AFTER HNO TA HOUR OF WAKING UP YOU O I'M NOT JUST I'ME JUST NOT THE BEST FERSION OF MYSALVR SO WE WAIT FOR THAT TIME PERD AND THEN WE DO SOME TESTING AND WE'VE DONE SOME TESTING BEFORE AND AFTER AND WE LOOK AT THE CHANGE AND THAT'S HOW WE MEASURE WHAT WAS THE BENEFIT OF NAPS THE REASON WHY WE SOMETIMES DO NIGHTY MINUTES SO THAT THEY GET ALL OF THOSE STAGES OF SLEEP AND THEN WE CORRELATE HOW MUCH BENEFIT DID YOU GET FROM THE NAP AND HOW MUCH OF THAT BENEFIT WAS EXPLAINED BY WHAT REMSLEEP YOU GOT WHAT DEEP SLEEP YOU GAT WHAT LIGHT SLEEP YOU GOT SO THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THAT WE USE THAP AS AN EXPERIMENTAL TOOL WHAT WE'VE ALSO FOUND IS THAT NAPS OF AS LITTLE AS SEVENTEEN MINUTES CAN HAVE SOME QUITE POTENT EFFECTS ON FOR EXAMPLE LEARNING NONE OF THIS IS NOVEL NASER PIONEER THIS BACK IN THE NINETEEN NIGHTIES AND DURING THE MISSIONS THEY WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH NAPS FOR THEIR ASTRONAULTS AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT NAPS OF LITTLE AS TWENTY SIX MINUTES IMPROVED AM AMISSION PERFORMANCE BY THIRTY FOUR PER CENT AND IMPROVED DAYTIME ALERTNESS BY FIFTY PERCENT AND IT BURTH WHAT WAS THEN CALLED THE NASER NAP CULTURE THROUGHOUT ALL TERRESTRIAL NASER SNAP DURING THAT TIME PERIOD SO IT'S LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT NAPS CAN HAVE A BENEFIT NAPS HOWEVER CAN HAVE A DOUBLE EDGE SWORD THERE IS A DARK SIDE TO NAPS AND IT COMES BACK TO OUR STORY OF A DENESENE AND SLEEP PRESSURE THE LONGER WE'RE AWAKE THE MORE OF THAT SLEEP PRESSURE DENAESNE THAT WE BUILD UP BUT WHAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU IS THAT WHEN WE SLEEP THE BRAIN GETS THE CHANCE TO ESSENTIALLY CLEAR OUT THAT A DENESENE AND AFTER ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF WAKEFULNESS AND THEN AFTER ABOUT EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP SEEMS TO BE ABLE TOO ALLOW THE BRAIN TO DEE CREASE IT'S A DENESENE LEVELS BAK TOO NORMAL AND SO NAPTUALLY WE SHOULD START TO WAKE UP WHICH ALSO ALINES WITH YOUR CICADIAN WITHTHM AND THOSE ARE TOO SEPARATE PROCESSES BUT WITH ABOUT EIGHT HOURS OF GOOD QUALITY SLEEP SEVEN TO NINE HOURS OF THE AVERAGE EDULT WE ARE FREE OF ALL OF THAP A DENESNE WE'VE AVACUATED IT ESSENTIALLY OUT OF THE BRAIN AND WE WAKE UP NATURALLY FEELING REFRESHED THE REASON THAT NAPS CAN BE PROTENTIALLY DANGEROUS IS THAT WHEN YOU NAP YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY OPENING THE VALVE ON THE PRESSURE COOKER OF SLEEP PRESSURE SHAND SOME OF THAP SLEEPINESS IS LOST BY WAY OF THE NAP SO FOR SOME PEOPLE AND NOT ALL PEOPLE AND YOU'RE GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS SOME PEOPLE HOWEVER IF THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH SLEEP AT NIGHT AND THEY NAP DURING THE DAY IT MAKES THEIR SLEEP PROBLEMS EVEN WORSE SO FOR PEOPLE WITHIN SOMNIA WE TYPICALLY ADVISE AGAINST NAPPING AND THE ADVICES IF YOU CAN NAP REGULARLY AND YOU DON'T STRUGGLE WITH SLEEP AT NIGHT THEN NAPS ARE JUST FINE BUT IF YOU DO STRUGGLE WITH SLEEP STAY AWAY FROM NAPS IF YOU ARE GOING TO NAP TRY TO LIMIT YOUR NAPS TRY TO CUT THEM OFF A BIT LIKES HAT OF CAFFINE MAYBE YOU KNOW EIGHT TO SO TWELVE HOURS MAY BE NOT THAP YOU KNOW FAR OFF MAY BE SAID OF SEVEN TO SIX HOURS IS A GOOD RULE OF THUMB TRY NOT TO NAP ESSENTIALLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND IF YOU DO TAKE A NAP AND YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN YOR YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT GROGGIN AS HANG OVER THAT CAN HAPPEN AFTER A FULL NIGHT OF SLEEP FOR THE FIRST HOUR TRY TO LIMIT IT TO ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AND THAT WAY YOU DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE VERY DEEPEST STAGES OF SLEEP WHICH I IF I RENCH YOU OUT OFF WITH AN ALARM THEN YOU JUST CANNO FEEL YOU ALMOST FEEL WUS FOR THE FIRST HOUR AFTER THE NAP I'VE DEFILY EXTERNS TTHAT IF I OVERSLEEP CERTAINLY IF O THE SUN GOES DOWN DURING MY NAP AND I WAKE UP AND LIGHT OVER ALL LIGHTING CONDITIONS HOFE CHANGED I FIND IT VERY HARD TO JOLT MYSELF BACK INTO THE EVENING AND IT IT CAN SCREW ME UP YI TRYND KEEP THOSE NAPS PRETTY BRIEF AND I SHOULD SAY UM I I'M VERY HAPPY TO HEAR YOU MENTION INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND WHY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT WANT A NAP AND OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT NOT WANT TO NAP A I HAVE A COLLEAGUE LEECHON LOW ILL BE FAMILIAR TO TO MANY NRBAL JUST EWHE'S A ABSOLUTE SPECTACULAR SCIENTISTS O MEMBER THE NATIONAL CADEMY HOURD HE'S INVESTIGATOR JUST O FENOM AND A AS A TON OF ENERGY BUT YEARS AGO I LEARNED THAT HE ALWAYS TAKES A NAP IN THE AFTERNOON SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN HE TRAVELS TO GIVE SEMINARS AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES HE WILL TELL HIS POST LUNCH UM IT PERHOST WHOEVER IT IS THAT HE'S PUS TO MEET WITH MAY I HAVE YOUR OFFICE FOR THIRTY MINUTES OF OUR SOMETIMES THIRTY MINUTE I DISCUSSION OR SIXTY MINUTE DISCUSSION CAUSE I LIKE TO TAKE A NAP AND HE DOES THAT AND THEN GIVES IS HIS TALKS ARE TYPICALLY IN THE AFTERNOON IN ACADEMIC CULTURE AND HE DESCRIBES THE THE EFFECT OF THE NAP FOR HIM THESE SHORT NAPS IN THE AFTERNOON BEING SO PROFOUND FOR HIS PRODUCTIVITY THAT'S I SHOLD WHAT INSPIRE ME TO START FEELING O KEY ABOUT MY DESIRED NAP AND SO I THINK OT FOR ME THAT WAS GREAT VINDICATION FOR THOSE THAT MIGHT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT WANTING A NAP BUT I I TAKE TO HEART YOUR NOTE ABOUT UM AVOIDING NAPS IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE FALLING IN STAYING O SLEEP CAUSE I THINK THAT I I'VE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ALSO IF THEY NAP THEY'RE RECK THEY CAN'T SLEEP E I THINK IT'S JUST WE'VE OFTEN BEING VERY PRO SLEEP WE AS SIT OF SLEEP COMMUNITY SO I THINK IT'S GOOD TO ALWAYS POINT OUT THESE POTENTIAL DOGSIDES OF OF ANY ASPECT BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT NO ONE SHOULD FEEL GUILTY ABOUT GETTING THE SLEEP THAT THEY NEED AND I THINK THAT'S BEING ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IN SOCIETY SOCIETY A STIGMATIZE SLEEP WITH THESE LABLS OF BEING SLOTHFUL OL LAZY AND WE'RE ALMOST EMBARRASSED YOU KNOW TO TELL COLLEAGUES THAT WE WE TAKE A NAP I THINK SLEEP IS A RIGHT OF HUMAN BEINGS AND I THE FULL THINK THAT SLEEP IS A CIVIL RIGHT OF OLD HUMAN BEINGS AND NO ONE SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL UNPROUD OF GETTING THE SLEEP THAT YOU NEED  I I LOVE THAT AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT AM I ALSO FEEL THAT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO UM BEAT YOUR COMPETITION IN ANY ENDEAVOR IS TO OUTLIVE THEM SOAND NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT  AN ENHANCE A LUNCHEVITY AND LACK OF SLEEP CAN SHORTEN ONE'S LIFE UM THAT'S ALL THE JUSTIFICATION I NEED ANY NAY A CAN SOMEBODY SLEEP TOO MUCH IS A OSIBLE TO GET TOO MUCH SLEEP IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND THERE ARE PROBALY TOO THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT THERE IS A CONDITION THAT WE CALL HYPOSOMNIA BUT THAT'S A MIXTURE OF THINGS IT'S WHERE PEOPLE HAVE EITHER A VERY HIGH SLEEP NEED OR THEY ARE VERY SLEEPY DURING THE DAY AND THEIR TYPICALLY FALLING ASLEEP AND THESE CAN HAPPEN IN AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CLINICAL CONTEXTS ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE WE'VE OFTEN SEEN HYPORSOMNEA BELIEVED TO MANIFEST IS IN DEPRESSION BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE STHUDIES IT TURNS OUT IT LOOKS MORE AS THOUGH THOSE PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY REPORTING BEING IN BED LONGER BUT NOT NECESSARILY SLEEPING LONGER AND THAT FITS VERY WELL WITH ONE OF THE PROFILES THAT WE KNOW OF DEPRESSION WHICH IS ANADONIA YOU DON'T GET PLEASURE FROM NORMNWY PLEASUABLE THINGS SO YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD YOU DON'T WANT TO INTERRACT BECAUSE YOU DEPRESSE SO WHAT YOU DO YOU JUST STAY IN BED LION TALOS WATCHING TO YOU RAY AND THAT JITT LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT TIME DID YOU GO TO BED AND WHAT TIME DID YOU GET OUT OF BED THE MISTAKE MADE IN THAT QUESTION IS OKAY THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME THE SLEEPING WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID WHAT TIME DID YOU FALL ASLEEP AND WHAT TIME DID YOU WAKE UP AND THE ANSWER COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT SO THAT TYPOSOMNIA FROM A CLINICAL CONTEXT CAN YOU SLEEP TOO MUCH THOUGH ONE OF THE DATA POINTS THAT ARGUES YAS THAT'S POSSIBLE IS WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL CAUSE MORTLITY CERTAINLY WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT USING THE SWEET SPOT OF SEVENTOR NINE HOURS WHEN YOU START TO DROP BELOW SEVEN HOURS THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP WHICH SUGGEST THAT THE SHORTO YOUR SLEEP THE SHORT TO YOUR LIFE SHORT SLEEP IN THAT REGARD PREDICTS ALL CAUSE MORTALITY BUT IT'S AGAIN NOT A LINEA RELATIONSHIP LIKE THE WONE THAT WE'VE SEEM WITH REM SLEEP ONCE YOU GET PAST NINE HOURS THE MORTALITY CURVE STOPS GOING DOWN AND THEN WANTS YOU GET FURTHER TEN OR LEVEN OURS IT HUCKS BACK UP AGAIN IT'S ALMOST LIKE A JA SHAPE TILTED OVER A LITTLE BIT AND REVERSED SO AS THIS STRANGE HUCK WHAT'S GOING ON HERE RIGHT NOW SLEEP SCIENCE HAS AT LEAST TOO NON MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS THE FIRST IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE POPULATIONS THE IDEA IS THAT THE WHATEVER WAS CAUSING THEM ILLNESS AND TOOK THEIR LIVES WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR SLEEP TO DEAL WITH HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE GET SICK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IMMEDIATELY IN THIS A WHOLE MECHANISM AND IN FLAMETARY MECHANISM CYTICIMEDIATED WHEN WE GET SICK WE WANT TO SLEEP WERE WE JUST WANT TO KELLUP IN BED AND YOUN SLEEP IT UP SLEEP IT OFF SO THE ARGUMENT THERE IS THAT IT'S NOT THAT SLEEP WAS KILLING PEOPLE PREMATURELY IT WAS THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE CALLING ON THE THE HELP OF SLEEP THEY WERE CALLING ON THES THING CALLED THE SWISS ARMY KNIFE OF HEALTH THAT IS SLEEP BUT WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY WERE FACING WAS JUST TOO POWERFUL FOR S LEEP TO OVERCOME SO IT ARTIFICIALLY LOOKS AS THOUGH MORE SLEEP LEADS TO A HIGHE RISK OF DEATH WHEN SLEEP WAS ATCHLHE RESPONDING TO THE MORTALITY RISK AND IT LOST THE BATTLE THAT'S ONE ARGUMENT THE SECOND IS THAT WE KNOW THAT SLEEP QUALITY AND POOR SLEEP EFFICIENCY IS A VERY STRONG PREDICTOR OF ALL CAUSE MORTALITY AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO OFTEN REPORT SLEEPING LONG AMOUNTS TEN OR ELEVEN HOURS THEY TYPICALLY REPORT HAVING VERY POOR QUALITY SLEEP SO BECAUSE THEIR QUALITY OF SLEEP IS POOR THEY JUST TRY TO SLEEP LONGER TO TRY AND GET SOME OF THAT BACK SO AGAIN HERE NOW IT'S POOR QUALITY SLEEP MASKING AS TOO MUCH SLEEP LEADING TOO THIS ARTIFICIAL HUCK WHICH LOOKS LIKE MORTALITY THAT'S A SECOND EXPLANATION A THIRD WHICH IS MORE OF A GODUNKAN WHICH IS JUST CANNOT LIKE A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT AND I'M OF THIS MENTALITY I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE SHARE THIS I ACTUALLY THINK THERE COULD BE A THING AS TOO MUCH SLEEP PHYSIOLOGICALLY I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BUT THE REASON I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN FOOD WATER OR OXYGEN CAN YOU OVER EAT YES YOU CAN CAN YOU UNDER EAT OF COURSE OR LIGE LIGHT IN THEIR EARLY WONDER THE DAY OR THROUGHOUT THE DAY WONDERFUL LIGHT LATE IN THE DAY NIGHT AT NIGHT DETRIMENTAL BY DIRECTIONAL YOU KNOW FOR WATER CAN YOU OVER HYDRATE HYPEN AN NEUTREMA IT CAN LEAD YOU KOW IT HAPPENED IN THE NINETY NINETIES AND TWO THOUSAND WITH THE ECSTASY CRAZE WERE GOVERNMENTS WERE SAYING YOUR DEHYDRATING YOU DANCING ALL NIGHT PLEASE DRINK WATER AND THEY DRANK TOO MUCH WATER THE BLOOD ELECTROLIGHTS WHEN YOU KNOW ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY WERE HAVING CARTY ACARESCES OR STROKE THAT PEOPLE  DINE AND THEY WERE DYING BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE HYDRATION CAN YOU GET TOO MUCH OXYGEN HYPEROC EMIA AND IT CAN CAUSE FREE RADICAL DAMAGE WHICH CAN BE PROFOUNDLY HARMFUL AND KILL BRAIN CELLS CAN YOU SLEEP TOO MUCH YOU KNOW WHICH IS THE FIFTH ELEMENT OF THEIR LIFE EQUATION YOU KNOW ALONGSIDE YOU KNOW FOOD WATER OXYGEN A SO FORTHI SHOULD SAY CAN'T EVEN COUNT CLEARLY I'M SLEEPING WELL AN YES I THINK THERE COULD BE THAT POSSIBILITY AR MOST PEOPLE IN DANGER OF GETTING TOO MUCH SLEEP O CONTRARY IF YOU LOOK AT PHE DATAR SO E BUT II DON'T DISMISS THAT IDEA I THINK IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S IT'S A VERY THOROUGH AND VERY NEW ARTST AND YOU'R VERY CLEAR ANSWERS I I ON IT'S SO INTERESTING TO THINK THAT A LOT OF THE THE THE DATE O THAT OUT THERE THAT TOG OU OUT BEING IN BED TOO LONG THAT IT'S JUST TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR THE ACTUAL FRAGMENTATION OF SLEEP SO THE UT I'M COMING AWAY WITH IS THAT THEY'RE MANY PATS TO THIS AND AR BOTH POSITIVE AND THINGS TO AVOID BUT THE IDEAS TO GET MOST NIGHT AY SIMILAR AMOUNT PROBABLY SEVEN AN NINE HOUR SOMEWHERE IN THERE OF HIG QUALITY SLEEP THAT THE NOTH OF SLEEP QUALITY IS GOING TO BECOME I WOULD HOPE A A PHRASE THAT MORE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT AND LEARN ABOUT AND CULTIVATE AS A PRACTICE A ONE ASK ABOUT A A SET OF BEHAVIORS THAT I'M AT LEAST I'M AWARE OF AT LEAST ONE COMPANY A STARTING TO TRACK IN THEIR SLEEP MONERING DEVICE AND THAT'S AM ORGANASM AND SEX ORGASM AND MASTERBATION TOPICS THAT ARE YOU KNOW I ARE SOMEWHAT AM SENSITIVE AM BUT AFROM THE PROSPECTIVE BIOLOGY AD A A NONE OF US WOULD BE HERE OR WE'RE NOT FOR A SPER MES EGG IN SOME FASHION EITHER IN ADDITOR OR IN VIVO AM BUT WHAT WHAT ARE THE DATA AS AS YOU KNOW THEM TO BE OR MAYBE LAVS EVEN DOING THIS KIND OF UM A WORK AND EXPLORATION ABOUT THE ROLL THAT SEX WORGASM MASTERBATION PLAY IN GETTING TO SLEEP AND STAYINED IS A SLEEP AND SLEEP QUALITY CERTAINLY THOSE BEHAVIORS AND THOSE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL EVENTS AVE BEEN PART OF OUR EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AM WHAT'S THE STORY THERE AND WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT THIS IN IN TERMS OF UM SCIENCE AND AND THERE AIS A PRACTICE YE A MEN IT'S ALMOST THAT CARICATURE OF YERN THE MOVIS WA YE A COUPLE MAKES LAV AND THAN ALL OF A SUDN YOU JUST SOIT OF HI SNORING OR YOU KNEWT HAVES WITH THE IDEA THAT ITSOMEWHAT SOMNEGANIC THAT IT'S SLEEP PROMOTING WELL THE PASORGASMIC INCREASE IN PROLAC WELL THAT'S IS HERE IS IS IS INTEREST OUGHT TO BE A A SET A NATURALLY CURING SADITIVE THERE PRESUMABLY HAS A FUNCTION IN AN OXITOSON HAS THAT ALSO THAT BENEFIT WE YOU SEE YOU KNOW A DISSIPATION OF THE FIGHTS OR FIGHT BRENCH OF THE NOV SYSTEM WHICH HAS TO HAPPEN FEU TO FULL ASLEEP THAT'S WHY WE OFTEN SEE OU KNOW HERE AT THE SLEEP SENSO WILL SEE IF PHENOMENON CALLED WIAT AND TIRED WHET PEOPLE SAY LOOK I AM SO DESPERATELY TIRED I A I JUST IAM SO SO TIRED BUT I CAN'T FULL ASLEEP BECAUSE I'M TOO WIRED SO YOU'R SLEEP DRIVE YOU'R YOU'RE DESPERATELY TIRED IT'S THAT BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE WIRED BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION TOO MUCH CAURTS US ALL AS WELL YOU CAN'T FULL ASLEEP IT'S A IT'S AN IMPRESSIVE ROAD BLOCK TO ANYTHINK LIKE GOOD SLEEP AND IT'S ONE OF THE PRINCIPULL MECHANISMS THAT WE NOW BELIEVE STRESS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVATION THAT IS THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF MANY FORMS OF INSOMNIA BUT COMING BACK TO SEX THE DATA IS AT TUALLEP QUITE COMPELLING THAT BOTH EITHER SUBJECTIVELY ASSESSED SLEEP QUALITY OR OBJECTIVE AMOUNTS OF SLEEP SEX THAT HAS RESULTED IN OL GASM AND I THINK IT'S THA THAT LASTA PART THAT TYPICALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN I WOULD IMAGIN SIA THAT YOU KNOW SO BETWEEN TOO MUTUALY EXCLUSIVE A INDIVIDUALS A WER BOTH AR YOU KNOW BENEFICIAL IN TIMES OF RECEIVING AN ORGANASM I WE HA DAY ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT SEX WE ARE REFERRING TO CONSENSIAL AGE APPROPRIATE SPECIES APPROPRIATE CONTEXT APPROBOW I WRITE AND NEVER EVEVEN GONE I LE O SE EIN TERE BECAUSE IE TE INTERING ET AND PEOPLE WILL COME UP WITH O OUSIDDEA SO I I THINK THAT A AE APOPRIATE I THINK AGE APPROPRIATE CONSENSUAL AND CONTEXT APPROPRIATING SPECIES APPROPRIATE COVERS ALL THE BASES GI  LET ANY PIC THEM IN THE COMMENT SECTION AND AND LB SURE TO TAKE NOTE YAD NITHING IT'S I THAT'S REALDY WELL SAID I'M AN IMPORTANT TO SAY SO THE DATO IS THAWHEN YOU LOOK AT COUPLES HO HAVE ORGASM WE'VE ALSO HOWEVER FOUND BENEFITS OF MASTABATION AND IT'S NOT FREQUENTLY SPOKEN ABOUT BUT WHAT IT IF YOU DO SOME SERVEYS IT TUNS OUT THAT PEOPLE WILL OFTEN USE MASTIBATION AS A SLEEP TOOL IF THE STRUGGLING WITH SLEEP AND I KNOW THIS IT SOUNDS ALMOST LIKE A STRANGE CONVERSATION OR IT'S A TOBUCOMOSITION BUT I I THINK WE JUST NEED TO BE VERY OPEN ABA STARTED OFF IN SCIENCE AM ONE OF THE THINGS I WORKED ON A EARLY MY CAREER NOT THE VERY FIRST TOPIC WAS  THE TOPIC OF EARLY INFLUENCES OF HORMONS ESTERGEN INTO SASTRON ON SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN AND NODY AND WHEN YOU ARE WEAND IN A LABORATORY LIKE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT ERA YOU LOOK AT SEC AND IT'S PBEHAVIORS AND IT'S HORMONES AND ITS PHYSIOLOGIES AS A SCIENTIST AND SOIT THAT'S TO BE CLEAR WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WERE EXPLORING THESE UMTHESE BEHAVIORS FROM THAT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE  ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN EVERY ONE IS HERE BECAUSE A SPERM MEDANEG EITHER IN ADDISH OR IN VEVO AS WE SAID BEFORE AND A AT LEAST IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT FACT HERAM AND WHAT PRECEDED THAT IS TYPICALLY THIS ACT WE CALL SAC AND SOMETIMES HOPEFULLY A I LIKE TO THINK WORGASM IS ASSOCIATE WITH THAT SEXUAL ACTIVITY NACERBATION AS ONE DIMENSION OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT CAN ON SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IF IN FACT THERARE DATA THAT RELATE IT TO SLEEP YE ANMD BOTH OF THOSE ROUTES SEEM TOLAD TO I'M A SLEEP BENEFIT NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ORGASSM I THINK AS WE SPOKE ABOUT WITH OXITOSIN THERE IS SOME DEGREE OF PA BONDING THAT IF YOU HAVE A POTNA AND YOU EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW AN INTIMATE LOVING YOU KNOW RELATIONSHIP THAT INVOLVES THAT THAND YOU CAN HAVE HOMONOL BENEFITS THAT AR SLEEP PROMOTING THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE SEEN IF YOU'RE JUST ENGAGING YOU KNOW IN THE SOLO SINGULAR ACT OF MASTABATION I'M SO WHAT WE SENTLY KNOWN  AND I I 'M NOT SOME ONES TAKE ANY ADVICE ON WHEN IT COMES TO AND I THINK RELATIONSHIP WISE OR SEX UISE I DIVIN APISODE YES CERTAINLY AND THAT'S NOT APOCA SERIES THAT I'M GOING TO BE RELEASING ANY TIMES SAING TO CING TO BE MOSTLY ABOUT A SLEEP ALTHOUGH I WILL TOUCH ON I'LL RELEASE UPON GEST ON SLEEP AND SEX BUT THAT'S THE DATO THAT WE HAVE SO FAR WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT WORKS BOTH WAYS THOUGH AND IT'S COMMONLY THIS THE SAME WAY WITH SLEEP A YOU NOW SLEEP AN EXERCISE SLEEP AND DIET HOW YOU EAT CAN EFFECT HOW YOU SLEEP HOW YOU SLEEP CAN EFFECT HOW YOU EAT SAME WITH EXERCISE AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR TOO SO HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER SEX CAN HELP WITH SLEEP CAN SLEEP HELP WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP AND SEX AND THE ANSWER IS YES IT CAN FIRSTLY WE KNOW AND WE SPOKEN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS THAT THE REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES ARE UNDER PROFOUND SLEEP REGULARLY SHOWTH ESTROGEN AND TUST ASTRO ESTRAGONES TESTASTRON IS WE HEREIS OR AN AAS TARS AS WELL BUT WOMEN WHO OR I SHOULD SAY ANY ONE WHOIS INTERESTED IN HAVING HIGHER LEVELS OF ASTROGEN OR OR NORMAL HEALTHY LEVELS OF ESTROGEN A I PRESUME THE DAY DO SHOW FOR ASTROGEN WHAT THE DATE ALSO SHOW YOSIR MORLY FOR TUST TASTOSGON IF YOU GET TOO LITTLE OR POOR QUALITY OF SLEEP BOTH SEX TORE IN HORMONES AS THER REFERRED TO TUST ASTRON GRAND ASTROGEN WHICH ARE PRESENT IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES AND EVERY VARIATION THEREOF OR GOING TO BE DIMINISHED BELON NORMAL HEALTHY YELS GRESTROGEN SESTOSTRONE A EFFES H IN WOMEN A AKEY HORMONE IN THE REGULATION A FOR A KEE FOR CONCEPTION OF COURSE ALL OF THESE SEX HORMONES SEEM TO BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY DESRUPTED WHEN SLEEP BECOMES OF SHORT QUANTITY OR POR QUALITY WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN WOMEN A SLEEP DISRUPTION CAN USUALLY LEAD TO MENSTRUAL PSYCHAL DISRUPTION WE KNOW THIS PARTICULALY FROM EVIDENCE IN SHIFT WORKING WOMEN WHERE THEY RE NIGHT TIMESHIFT WORKERS THEY STRUGGLE WITH SLEEP DURING THE DAY OFTEN MENSTRATION IS DESTRUPTED OR EVEN BECOMES IMPAD BUT WE ALSO KNOW IT WORKS THIS WAY NOT JUST FOR SEX HORMONES BUT FOR SEX ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE WE FOUND THAT FOR EVERY ONE HOUR OF SLEEP EXTRASLEEP THAT A WOMAN GETS HA INTEREST IN BECOMING SEX SLEEP INTIMATE WITH HER PARTNER INCREASES BY FOURTEEN PERCENT WHICH IS YOU KNOW ANDS ANONDERIRIAL AMOUNT AND THEN THE FINAL PART OF I THINK THIS EQUATION WHEN IT COMES TO SLEEP AND SEX IS YOUR YOUR RELATIONSHIP ITSELF AND THOUGH SOME GREAT WORK HERE FROM YOU SEE BOKLY BY A PROFESSOR SERENA CHAN AND WHAT CHIE FOUND WAS THAT RESTLESS NIGHTS MEAN FOR FAR MORE BRUTAL FIGHTS IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP AND THEY DID THIS AN INVINUMBEROUS OF DIFFERENT ELEGANT WAYS AND VICE FIRSTER AS WELL AM WE NOT THAT I'VE EVER HAD CONFLICT AN RELATIONSHIP A ME N LIG IN A I JUS THIS US IST DAYS TRITER AD OF NEVER EXPERIENCE THAT IT'S ALL A SO AND THEY FOUND RELIABLY THAT SLEEP WOULD PREDICT HIA LIKELY HERD OF RELATIONSHIP CONFLICT SECONDLY IF YOU GOT INTO THAT CONFLICT THE CHANCES IF YOU RESULVING IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LEA WHEN THE POTIES HA NOT BEING SLEEPING WELL PAT OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE NOT WELL SLEPT YOUR EMPATHY GOES DOWN SO YOUR NOT YOUR TAKING MORE OF AN AGRASIVE STENTS WITH YOURPATNA ROTH THAN EMO AGREEABLE STENTS WITH YOU PATNA SO IT ALMOST EVERY DIMENSION OF A HUMAN LEVING RELATIONSHIP SLEEP CAN HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT I THINK THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO UNDER SCORE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET THAT ARE OBSESSED WITH THIS AM I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE IT'S ALL ALL THIS INTERNETSTELF A SHOUTING INTO A TOMNEC AN AND CONENTS BACK IND WRITTEN FORMANCE A VERY BAZAARE CONVERSATION THI I SO TO SPEAK AM IS WHETHER OR NOT SEXUAL BEHAVIOR ITSELF LOWERS ARE INCREASES TESTOSTRONE AND I WENT INTO THE DATA UM WHICH EXPANDS MANY DECADES ACTUALLY BOTH ANIMAL STUDIES IN HUMAN STUDIES AND IT SEEMS A JUST TO UNDERSCORE THE AS LONG AS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SUBJECT THAT AM IT DOES SEEM THAT SEXUAL ACTIVITY SECTS BEBETWEEN TWO PEOPLE DOES SEEM TO INCREASE TESTOSTERONE IN BOTH THERE IS THIS QUESTION ABOUT ORGAASM OR NO ORGAASM EJACULATION NO EJACULATION ANA AND INDEED THERE DO SEEM TO BE SOME EFFECTS OF OF AM OF RESTRICTING EJACULATION IN MALS HAS A FORM OF FURTHER INCREASING TESTOSTERONS OF SEX WITHOUT EJACULATION FURTHER INCREASING TESTSTRONE BUT THE DATA ARE NOT CLEAN A PRESUMABLY BECAUSE ORGANIZING THESE SORTS OF STUDIES AND GETTING TRUTH IN IN SELF REPORTING IS PROBABLY HARD TO GET FROM FROM SUBJECTS BUT UM BUT IT EVERYTHING SORT OF POINTS IN THE DIRECTION THAT PROVIDED THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS A HEALTHY ONE IT'S ITS CONSENSUALSAGE APPROPRIATE CONTECTS APPROPRIATE SPECIES APPROPRIATE THAT SEC BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS DOES SEEM TO INCREASE THE SEXTROID HARMONS TESTOSTRON AND ESTRGEN TOWARD HEALTHY RANGES AND WHAT I'M HEARING NOW THE SORT GESTALT OF OF THE DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD IS THAT THAT TO CAN PROMOTE SLEEPINESS RESTFUL STATES AND QUALITY SLEEP AND UM I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT JUST HASN'T BEEN HELD ENOUGH I MANG SOONER OR LATER AM BOTH IN THE YOU ASS AND ELSEWHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS OF SOME SORT AND THAT WE HAVE CHOICE IN LIFE ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS UM FROM SUPPLEMENTATION TO SECTS OR NO SECTS ET CETERA BUT THAT THEY HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON OUR CORBIOLOGY I MEAN IT'S FASCINATING TO ME THAT THE AREAS OF THE HYPOTHALEMUS THE PREOPTIC AREIA THE SUPEROPTIC AREAS THOSE AREAS WHICH THE NAMES MIGHT NOT MEAN ANYTHING TO ANYBODY BESIDES A NAT INI SITTING HERE BUT THOSE AREA SIT CHEEK TO JOWL WITH EACH OTHER IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS AND CONTROL SLEEP AND SECTS THE TRIGGER OF ORGAASM THE APPETITE FOR FOOD YO APPETIEOTER FOR ELECTRO LIGHTS I MEAN I BUTHALMUS IS KIND OF A UM A FESTIVAL OF OF NORONS WITH DIFFERENT BOOTHS FOR DIFFERENT I JUST FROR MEWYHAZES OLS ATURE IN THE BRAIN BUT IT'S THE OCHISTRATOR OF THE FAST NUMBER OF OUR BEHAVE IS DISPROPORTIONA IT SOMES OF ITS SIZEF US IS A FACT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO TO THIS HYPOTHILAMIC FESTIVAL WITHOUT IT'S A AT LEAST SEEING ALL THE BOOTHS WHETHER R NOT YOU DECIDE OIN OR NOT A AM MASTERNALOGY SO AM SO I'MN'T SO I'M GLAD THAT WE'VE BROACH THAT CONVERSATION AND I HOPE PEOPLE WILL UM WILL THINK THAT WE'VE APPROACHED TO WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL SENSITIVITY IT'S IT'S AN IMRDNT ONE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE CERTAINLY THINKING ABOUT THIS IF NOT UM ENGAGING IN IN THESE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS OR AVOIDING THEM IM SO THE MORE WE CAN UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE MIOLOGY THE BETTER SUM AND SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT TOPIC UP BECAUSE FOR THE RECORD MAT A TABLED IT FOR DISCUSSION WE CEN TO   A CAT TING OUTSIDE YTHING SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE ERTHATIV SECT AN I SUR AUT WE CAN GO THA THAT'S SO LECH INTERESTING AB ABSOLUTELY UM I WANT A TOUCH ON JUST TREMAINING TOPICS ONE IS ARE THERE ANY UNCONVENTIONAL SLEEP TIPS OR THINGS ABOUT SLEEP THAT THAT WE'VE OVERLOOKED IF IF WE COVERED EVERYTHING GREAT BUT IM YOU KNOW HERE TO KEEP THE ROOM COOL WE HEAR A BECAUSE OF THIS TEMPERATURE PHENOMENON THE LIGHT ASPECTS THE CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT ALCOHOL C B D MAROANA IM COGNOF BEHAVIOUR ALL TARTCHERY FO N WEAS PERHAPS PERHAPS PLEASE DON'T PUT ME ON THE HYETCHERS YEIIS JUST OFFERING WHAT I KNOW NOIS ENES E CONSIDERATIONS AND AND WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ABATCH THESE THINGS I I WON'T EVEN LIST THEM OFF NOW BECAUSE THEYRE TOO MANY JOKES THAT ONE ON C UM AND I HAVE NO AFFILIATION WITH ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS I'M OVINAN TAKE OUT A TOUT ANYTHIN WE COMPANY N A BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE IS ABOUT ANY UNCONVENTIONAL OR LESSER KNOWN THINGS OR MAYBE YOU DO THINGS OR YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS JUST IN A PURELY A EXPLORATORY WAY AS A SCIENTIST O THAT YOU KNOW THET THE WHAT IF A KIND OF THINGS THAT AN WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT AND I HEAR I JUST I VE GOT A BLANK THERE FOR YOU TO FILL IN I THINK YOU BEYOND THE STAND A YOU KNOW FAIR THAT IVE DISHED OUT PLENTY OF TIMES OF SLEEP HIGEN AF YOU KNOW REGULARITY TEMPERATURED DOGNES IM ALCOHOL CAFI AN WE'VE WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT ALL OF THOSE WHAT IS SOME MORE UNCONVENTIONAL TIPS I GUESS THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS UNCONVENTIONAL ALONG LINES OF NAPS IF YOU'VE HAD A BAD NIGHTS OF SLEEP LET'S SAY THAT YOURE STOCTING TO IMAGE WITH IN SOMNIA AND YOU'VE HAD A BAT NIGHTS OF SLEEP THE ADVICE AND I LAND THIS FROR MY WONDERFUL CALL IT MICHAEL PALACE DO NOTHING WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS DON'T WAKE UP ANY LATER DON'T SLEEP IN THE FOLLOWING DAY TO TRY AND MAKE UP FOR IT DON'T NAP DURING THE DAY DON'T CONSUME EXTRA CAFFINE TO WAKE YOU UP TO TRY TO GET YOU THROUGH THE DAY AND DON'T GO TO BED ANY EARLIER TO THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO COMPENSATE AND I CAN EXPLAIN ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT IF YOU WAKE UP LATER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SLEEPY UNTIL LATTO THE EVENING SO YOU GONG TO GO TO BED AT YOUR NORMAL TIME AND YOU WON'T BE SLEEP IN YOU'LL THINK WHILE I JUST CAME OFF A BAD NIGHT OF SLEEP AND NOW I I STILL A'M I CAN'T EVEN GET TO SLEEP AND IT'S MY NORMAL TIME 'SBECAUSE YOU SLEPT IN LATER THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE AND YOU REDUCE THE WINDOW OF A DENACINE ACCUMULATION BEFORE YOUR NORMAL BED TIME SO DON'T GO DON'T WAKE UP ANY LATER DON'T USE MORE CAFFINE FOR THE REASONS AT THAT ARE OBVIOUS BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY GING TO CRANK YOU NT KEEP YOU AWAKE THE FLLOWING NIGHT OR DECREASE THE PROBABILITY OF A GOOD FOLLOWING NIGHT OF RECOVERY SLEEP IM THIRD I'M I MENTION DON'T TAKE NAPS BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THAT WILL JUST TAK YOU NON'T NAPS PARTICULARLY LATER IN THE AFTERNOON I ALMOST LIKEN THEM TO SNACKING BEFORE A MAIN MEAL IT JUST TAKES YOUR APPETIT OFF THE EDGE OF THAT MAIN MEAL OF SLEEP SO DON'T DO IT AND THEN FINELY DON'T GO TO BED ANY EARLIER RESIST AND RESIST AND GO TO BED AT YOUR NORMAL TIME WHAT I WANT TO TRY AND DO IS PREVENT YOU FROM THINKING WHILE I HAD SUCH A BAD NIGHT LAST NIGHT AND I NORMALLY GO TO BED AT TEN THIRTY I'M JU GING TO GET INTO BED AT NINE O'CLOCK BECAUSE LAST NIGHT WAS JUST SO BAD BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR NATURAL BED TIME AND IT'S NOT A LINED WITH YOUR NATURAL CRONO TYPE BECAUSE PRESUMABLY YOU CAN IVE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT OUR MORNING TIME EVENING TIME YOU TRAN TA SLEEP IN HARMONY WHICH IS YUSLEEP OR HOW YOU GET BEST QUALITY SLEEP BUT YOU GO TO BED AT NINE AND MY BODY IS NOT READY TO TO SLEEP AT NINE O'CLOCK BUT I'M WORRIED BECAUSE I HAD A BAD NIGHT OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT SO I GET INTO BED AND NOW I'M TOSSING IN TURNING FOR THE FIRST HOUR AND A HALF BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY NATURAL SLEEP WINDOW BUT I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHNG ABOUT SLEEP I WOULD THINK ALL OF THESE SAME THINGS TOO AS I'M NOT FINGER WAGGING BUT AFTER IF I HAVE A BAD NIGHT OF SLEEP AND I AM NOT IMMUNE JUST BECAUSE I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SLEEP DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE MY BAD NIGHTS I DO DOESN'T MEAN I HAVEN'T HAD BOUTS OF INSOMNIA IN MY LIFE I HAVE BUT AFTER A BAD NIGHT OF SLEEP I DO NOTHING I DON'T DO ANY OF THOSE FOR THINGS I THINK THE SECOND TIP I'M I WOULD OFFER IN TERMS OF UNCONVENTIONAL ITS HAVE A WIND DOWN ROUTINE MANY OF US THINK OF SLEEP AS IF IT SLIKE A LIGHT SWITCH THAT WE JUST DOMP INTO BED AND WHEN WE TURN THE LIGHT OUT SLEEP SHOULD ARRIVE IN THAT SAME WAY TO THE BINERY YOU KNOW IT'S HONOR IT'S OFF SLEEP IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE LANDING A PLAIN IT TAKES TIME TO GRADUALLY TO SEND DOWN ON TO THE TERRA FARMER OF WHAT WE CALL GOOD SOLID SLEEP AT NIGHT FIND OUT WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU AND IT COULD BE LIKE STRETCHING I USUALLY MEDITATE AN FOR ABOUT TEN OR FIFTY MINUTES A BEFORE BAD SOME PEOPLE LIKE READING TRY NOT TO WATCH TEL VISION IN BAD THAT'S ODEALLY IT DLIS IT IS YOU WON'T  LIKE YOU'RE HOW MUCH LIKE TOO ACTIVATING NO YOU CAN LISTEN TO RELAXING CODCAST ALTHOUGH WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IN THE BEDROOM TO BUT HAVE SOME KIND OF A WINE DOWN ROUTINE IT'S YOU KNOW I IT'S ALMOST YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T RACE INTO YOUR GARRAGE AND COME TO IT  SCREECHING HALT FROM SIXTY MILES AN HOUR YOU TYPICALLY DOWN SHIFTY GEARS AND YOU SLOW DOWN AS YOU COME INTO THE ARRAGE THIS THE SAME THING WITH WITH SLEEP TO SO THAT'S THE SECOND THING HAVE SOME KIND OF A WINE DOWN ROUTINE FIND WHAT WORKS FOR YOU MAYBE IT'S TAKING A HOT BATH OR A WARM SHOWER AND THEN STICK TO IT JUST WE DO THIS WITH KIDS ALL THE TIME WE FIND OUT WHAT THEY'R BEDROOM STRRY THEIR BED TIME REGIMENT IS AND THEN WE JUST STICK TO IT FAITHFULLY BUT WE HUMANS ARE THE SAME WAY TO THE THIRD THING IS A MYTH DON'T COUNT SHEEP IFS A STUDY DONE HERE IT YOU SEE BUGLY I DIDN'T DO THIS THEDY I WISH IT DID IT'S BY MY COLLEAGUE PROFESSOR OUS AND HARVEY AND THEY FOUND THAT COUNTING SHEEP ACTUALLY MADE IT HARDER TO FALL ASLEEP MADE MATTERS WORSE AS A CONTER A SORRY COUNTER A MEASURE TO THAT WHAT THEY DID FIND WAS THAT TAKING YOURSELF ON SOME KIND OF A MENTAL WALK SO THINK ABOUT AN NICE WORK THAT YOU TAKE IN NATURE OR A WALK ON THE BEACH OR EVEN A WALK AROUND AND ERBIT IS YOU IROMON AND VISUALIZING THAD THAT SEEM TO BE BENEFICIAL THE OTHER THING ABOUT AM SOT OF THAT IDEA OF SHIFTING FOCUS AWAY FROM YOUR MIND ITSELF GET YOUR MIND OFF ITSELF IS A GOOD PIECE OF ADVICE CATHARSIS YOU CAN TRY TO WRITE DOWN ALL F THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE AND DO THIS NOT WRITE BEFORE BAD BUT USUALLY AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE BAD SOME PEOPLE CALL CALL IT A WORRY JOURNAL AND TO ME IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE CLOSING DOWN ALL OF THE EMOTIONAL TABS ON MY BROWSER BECAUSE IF I SHUT THE COMPUSER DOWN AND ALL O THOSE TABS ARE STILL OPEN I'M GONG TO COME BACK IN THE MORNING THE COMPUSERS RED HEART THE FANS GOING BECAUSE IT DIDN'T GO TO SLEEP BECAUSE IT COULDN'T BECAUSE THERE WERE TOO MANY TABS ACTIVE AND OPEN I THINK IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH SLEEP AS WELL SO TRY TO THINK ABOUT DOING THAT SO JUST VOMIT OUN ALL YOUR CONCERNS ON THE PAGE A IVE THET LITHERY  AM WAKING AS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH ME RIDING DOWN THE LISTS OF THINGS THAT I'VE REGARD TO DO THAT I NEED TO DO YE AND IN IN ONCE I EVENTUALLY WAKE UP FROM THE LATER NIGHT A SI CAN HAVE OF THE NIGHT SLEEP THATSTOFT SEEMS MUCH MORE TRACTABLE AND REASONABLE BUT A SURE WOULD BE GREAT TO GET THAT STOFF OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE SLEEP WELL THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE OFE SPOKEN ABOUT A LOT AND I'D LIKE TO RESEARCH IT WHICH IS DIFFICULTY AND ANXIETY AT NIGHT IN THE DAR ALK IS NOT THE SAME DIFFICULTY AND ANXIETY IN THE LIGHT OF DAY AND WHEN WE HAVE THOSE THOUGHTS AT NIGHT IT COMES WITH A MAGNITUDE OF RUMINATION AND CATASTROPHIZ ATION THAT IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO THAT WHICH YOU WOULD DESCRIBE WHEN YOU ARE AWAKE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ABOUT THE BRAIN AND THOUGHT AND IN MOTION AT THE TIME I'VE GOT A BUNCH OF THEORIESIS TO WHY AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE IDEA OF CLOSING UP ZIPPING UP ALL OF THOSE DIFFEREND COMPONENTS JUST GET THEM OUT ON THE PAGE AND IT FEEL AND I AT FIRST THOUGHT THIS JUST SOUNDS LIKE WHO  IT SOUNDS VERY BUCKLY IT'S CAN NAT COME BY OUR WE ALL HOLD HANDS AND YOU KNOW WELL COME AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT THEN THIS THE DATIS THOUGH'S COMING OUT READY GOUDS THATIES FROM GOOD PEOPLE AND THEY FOUND THAT KEEPING ONE OF THOSE GENERALS DECREASE THE TIME IT TAKES YOU TO FALL ASLEEP BY FIFTY PER CENT FIVE ERO IT'S WELL ON CAL WITH ANY PHOMSUITICAL AGENT O ABSETUNA I'M CONVINCE THAT I'VE LONG THOUGHT THAT THE WORRIESE IN CONCERNS AND IDEAS I HAVE AT THREE FOR I M I'VE LEARNED TO NOT PLACE ANY STOCK IN THEM YE BECAUSE EVER SOMETHING I'M GLAD THAT YOU MIGHT AM DECIDE TO EVENTUALY LOOK AT THIS IN YOUR LABORATORY BECAUSE I YOU LIKE SOMETHING IS MELTED AWAY OR ALTERED I SUSPECT IT IN THE A THE REGULATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT IT MAKE SENSE WHY I CONCERN AT THREE FOR I M OUGHT TO EVOKE MORE OF A PANIC SENSE THAN I CONCERN CANCE AND CERTAINLY THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE ALTHOUGH NOT I FORTUNE DO NOT SUFFER FROM FULLBLOWN PAANIC ATTACKS BUT EVERYTHING SEEMS WORSE AT THREE FOR I M Y ADED YOUR AWAKE AND WE WE NEED TO TO T LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT SUICIDE RATES AROUND THE TWENTY FOR OUR CLOCK FACE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER RATES IN THOSE MIDDLE S AT OF NIGHT HOURS SO NOW NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S COURSITIVE OR NOT BUT SOMETHING YOU KNOW I COULD JUST BE THAT THAT'S THE TIME WHEN WERE MOSTLY LONELY AND WERE BY OURSELVES AND THAT'S THE REASONS HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH SLEEP ALL THE NIGHT TIME I DON'T KNOW AM SO THAT'S THE THIRD THING I THINK THE FOURTH SAT OF LITTLE TIP I WOULD GIVE THAT'S UNCONVENTIONAL IS REMOVE OLD CLOCK FACES FROM YOUR BEDROOM INCLUDING YOUR PHONE INCLUDING YOUR PHONE AND RESIST CHECKING IT NOW I KNOW AND I CAN SPEAK ABOUT THE PHONE TO THAT GENIE OF TECHNOLOGY IS OUT THE BOTTLE AND IT'S NOT GOING BACK IN ANY TIME SOON SO WE'VE GOT TO THINK OF SCIENTISTS AND SLEEP SCIENTIST YOU KNOW AS TO WHAT WE DO WITH U NOPHONES IN THE BETTE OBUT I A YEARS AGO WAS A COUNCERT O SUMMER CAMP I WORKED WITH ATRIS KIDS AND THE AM THERE WAS A PHRASE THAT COMES TO MINE HERE ITS BE A CHANNEL NOT A DAM BECAUSE WE MA SHY AND DAMN CERTAIN KINDS OF BEHAVIOR AM PHYSICALLY DAMN CERTAIN KINDS OF BEHAVIOR NOT MORALLY DAM AM THAT TO A IT S DRREAPS OVER THE EDGE AND YOU GET AND YOU GET A A WATERFALL IM SEE HA AS GAN OL THE PHONA AND DEVICES HAVE TO BE WORKED WITH IN NEGOTIATED NOT'S RIGHT AND D THINK ABOUT THOSE MINDFULLY TO BUT CLOCK FACES REMOVE ALL OF THOSE BECAUSE IF YOU ARE HAVING YOU KNOW A TOUGH NIGHT KNOWING THAT IT'S THREE TWENTY TWO IN THE MORNING OR IT'S FULL FORTY EIGHT IN THE MORNING DOES NOT HELP YOU IN THE SLIGHTEST AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE MATTES WORSE THAN BETTE SO TRY TO REMOVE OLD CLOCK FACEIS I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THOSE O THE TIPS THAT SOME PEOPLE AF FOUND HELPFUL BUT THOSE WOULD BE SAID OF SOME SLIGHTLY UNCON VENTIONAL I GUESS MORE THAN YOUR STOCK FARE OF HERE THE FIVE TIPS FOR SLEEP I GENE TO NIGHT AND SO THOSE ARE TERRIFIC SLEEP TIPS AND U'M SEVERAL OF WHICH IF NOT ALL OF WHICH I'M GOING TO INCORPORATE UM THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING A DEEP DIVE ON SLEEV AND IT'S POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REGULATORS I HOWPE IT HASN'T BEEN TOO LONG AND I I DOS HAS BEEN GREAT CUT IT DOWN SHORTEN IT TOO A YOU KNOW HAVE SINE TE MINUTES OF MAMSOLALHAT I A BUT ABSOLULY NOT EVER IT IT IS CHALKA BLACK FUL OF VALUABLE TAKE AWAYS IT'S BEEN A A

FALL ON YOUR WORK VERY CLOSELY BUTH YOUR SCIENTIFIC WORK IN DETAIL AND UM YOUR PUBLIC FACING I EDUCATIONAL WORK IS THAT YOU VERY MUCH WANT THE BEST FOR PEOPLE AND IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING THING AS A

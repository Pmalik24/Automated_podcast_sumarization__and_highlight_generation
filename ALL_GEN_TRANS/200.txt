WHEN YEU DON'T LOOK ETHMICALLY RUSIAN I KNOW I GREW UP ON RUSSIA LOOKING UN RUSSIAN AND I GET TEASED CHASTE AND BEATEN UP A LOT CARAN'S NAME  MARKS HIM AS AN AURMENIAN HE HAD TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO BE RUSSIANNEITHER ON  OTHER HAND WITH HER BLON HAIR AND BLUE GRAY EYES GROWING UP IN MOSCOW SHE CERTAINLY NEVER HAD TO DEFEND HER RIGHT TO BE THERE SHE MOVED A KE AS A KIND OF EXPERIMENT AND FOUNDAN SHE LUFTED THERE BECAME HER HOME CARANO LOT OF NETHERS FRIENDS THOUGH KEPT ASSUMING SHE WAS AN EUCRANE TEMPORARILY ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT CARAN WAS A LITTLE DRUNK AND THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED FOR THIS FIGHT HE WAS WE STARTED OVER SCHOOLS AND THEN IT WENT TO THAT EUCRANIAN CULTURE IS NOT CULTURE AND THE LANGUAGE IS NOT LANGUAGE AND ALL THAT AND HE WENT ON IN ON AND AT FIRST I WAS SHOCKED AND SO HE WAS LIKE HIS SUDU MANY THINGS AND THEN I WAS LIKE WAT WHAT WHAT DO I SUFPECE TO DO BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGHT WITH MI DON'T BECAUSE I HAVE TO KEEP GOOD FELATIONSHIP BECAUSE HE IS LUCAS FATHER SO I WAS LIKE A CATE PLEASE DON'T SAY THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE EUCRANIANS HE WAS LIKE NOW YOU KNOW EUCRANIANS YOU RUSSIANS YOU FROM MOSCOW AND HE'S RUSSIAN ANOTHE CA YET OF COURSE I WAS BYISTAN I AM STILL BY US AN BUT BY AS TILE BYS SE TOWARD RUSSIAN HERITAGE THIS IS IMPORTANT PART OF MY DIDNTO HE AND I WAS CONVINCED THAT THAT A THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF HIS IDENTITY ALSO IN FACT AN HAD ALWAYS HOPED THAT NEITHER WOULD MOVE BACK TO MOSCOW NEITHER HAD ZERO INTENTION OF DOING THAT IS THING IS I ALWAYS HATED THE IDEA THAT HE HAS TO GO TO MOSCOW EVEN OL VER THEY A VACATION I NEVER LIKED THE INFLUENCEI WAS ON HIM NOT THAT SHE SAID THE STOCAREN WHY STARTIFI BECAUSE ALL THE TIME LUCA WAS GOING TO RUSSIA FOR ONE MONTHS A YEAR HIS FATHER WAS LIKE INSISTENTLY FEEDING HIM THAT HE WIL RUSSIAN YOU NOT EUCRANIAN E GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUCRANE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS EUCRANIAN CULTIR THE EUCRANIAN LANGUAGEIS NO GOOD AND THERE'S THIS CRAMANDES RUSSIAN CULTU OUSHULD HEDING TOWARDS THAT AND THEN LUCA WOULD BE COMING BACK IN SAYING YOUNG I DON'T LIKE TO A TANT SOME EUCRANIAN HOLLIDAYS O WHERE WE CHIVAN CAN OWE WHY WOULD YO DO THAT OF A CHAVANKA IS A TRADITIONAL EUCRANIAN EMBROIDERED SHIRT KRAN TOLD ME HED IN HAVINGTHING AGAINST EUCRANIAN TRADITION IN PARTICULAR WE ALL KNOW THAT A TRADITIONAL COSTUMES AR JUS LIDERLY THAT TASTE FOR LIKE EVERYBODY INNO MATTER IF THIS IS VICHAVANKA OR TRADITIONAL RUSSIAN COSTUME WE LOOK DOWN TO THAT IN GENERAL BECAUS SILY BECAUSE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE NATIONALES WE ALL HATED ALWAYS LIKE AT LEAST WE THOUGHT WE HATED THERE'S HA BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUSSIAN AND EUCRANIA NATIONAL COSCUMES THE VACHAVANKA LONG BEFORE THE WAR WAS A SYMBOL OF THE RENAISCENCE OF EUCRANIAN CULTURE AND IDENTITY AFTER THE FALL OF THE SOVI UNION YEUCRANE WAS A FORMER COLONY OF RUSSIA KARAN LIKE MOST RUSSIANS WAS OBLIVIOUS TO THIS THIS IS ANOTHER BOT LIKE A RUSSIA RECRAGES THIS IS ABOT LIKE SENSEESS STYLE KIND OF TO NEITHE IT WAS ABOUT KARAN'S ATTITUDES TOWARD ALL THINGS YOUCRANIAN HE THOUGHT KIVE WAS A BACKWATER I HATE TO MENTION IT BUT I HE WAS VISITING MUSEUMS OR THEATRES OR CONCERTS ONLY WHEN I WAS A COMING TO KES AND I TOOK HIM TO LIKE SAME TO A THREE MUSEUMS AND NOT TO MENTION THEATRES THERE ARE ALMOST NONE IN KES HOW MUCH A THEATR AN THAN THE MUSEUMS DID YOU GET WHEN YOU WERECID UNFORTUNATELY NOT A TO MUCH NOT TO MANI BECAUSE I WAS BORN AND RASED IN A SIBERIA IN USK AND THIS IS NOT LIKE THE CULTURE CENTRE EVERY PARENT WANTS TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN WHAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE GROWING UP NEITHE UNLIKE KAREM GREW UP IN THE CENTERE OF MOSCOW IN THE VERY HEART OF THE EMPIRE IN A PRIVILEGED FAMILY KARAN COULDN'T BELIEVE SHE WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP WHAT HE HAD SO LONGED FOR AS A KID NEITHER FOR HER PART ONE E TO ABOID CONFLICT SO IN THE END LUCA DIDN'T GO TO E UCRANIAN SCHOOL OR RUSSIAN SCHOOL HE ENROLLED IN A GERMAN SCHOOL GV WHEN THE WORST STARTED ALL THOSE THINGS THAT LUCA HAD HEARD HIS FATHER SAY THAT HE AND HIS MOTHER REALLY RUSSIAN THESE IDEAS HID TO LUCA HARD HIS FATHER'S COUNTRY WAS BAMMING HIS MOTHERLAND LUKA WAS CRYING AND SAYING ITS MY FAULT IM RUSSIA SO I CALLED HIS FATHER AND A SAID LOOK WHAT HAVE YOU DONE LUCA NOW WI THINGS THAT IS HIS FAULT BECAUSE HE IS RUSSIAN HE FELT THAT HE'S HALF THIS AND HALF THAT AND NOW THERE IS HUGE IN THEIR CONFLICT INSIDE OF HIM BECAUS LIKE TO HIM TO HES KID'S MIND THERE WAS LIKE ONE HALF OF HIM HES ATTACKING THE OTHER HALF OF HIMSELF TALKING TO LUCA DIDN'T HELP MUCH MAYBE HE COULD BE CONVINCED THAT THE WOR WASN'T HIS FAULT BUT HE WAS STILL STUCK WITH THIS PROBLEM OF BEING BOTH EUCRAMIAN AND RUSSIAN THE WAR WAS TEARING HIM APART IT MAYBE DIDN'T HELP THAT HE AND HIS MAMS WERE STILL IN THE MOVE THEY FINALLY LANDED IN LISBON I WAS LIKE THINKING MAY BE SUGGESTING MAYBE YOU THINK YOU AN BE PORTUGUESA SANCE WE LEAVING PORTUGA AND HE WAS IKE NONE NOW I'M GERMAN I'M DEFINITEY GERMAN LIKE WINE AND THEN THE PSYCALLOGES EXPLAIN TO ME THAT IT THIS AGE THEY JUST PIK THE SAVEST INVIRONMEN LUCA HAD CONE TO GERMAN SCOLINTU HE WAS GOING TO START A TENDING A GERMAN SCO AND LISBON CHOOSING GERMANY WAS AWAY TO AVOID CHOOSING OU CRANE WERE CHOOSING RUSSIAN A WAY TO AVOID CHOOSING BETWEEN HIS PARENTS I THINK GERMANY FELT NEUTRAL FIHT'S NUMBER THREE IN NUMBER FOR CREMEA AND THE GLOBE IF HEAS BACK I DON' SURPRISE NITHER FOR HIS PART OF SUMMER VACATION HIS SUGGESTED TAKING LUCA TO CRAMEA CRMEA HAD BEEN UNDER RUSSIAN OCCUPATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS ONCE UPON A TIME IT HAD BEEN A VACATION DESTINATION FOR BOTH RUSSIANS AND EUCRAMIANS BUT AFTER THE OCCUPATION CREMEA WAS OFF LIMITS RE

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN SCIENCESCIENCEPACTO I MAY DRA HUBERMEN AND OM R PROFESSOR F NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS RICK REUBEN RIC REUBEN IS CREDITED WITH BEING ONE OF THE MOST CREATIVE AND PROLIFIC MUSIC PRODUCERS OF ALL TIME THE RANGE OF ARTISTS WITH WHOM HE'S WORKED WITH AND DISCOVERED IS ABSOLUTELY STAGGERING RANGING FROM ARTIST SUCH AS ELLO COOL JA PUBLIC ENEMY MINOR THREAT FUGAZI BEASTI BOYS JEESUS AND MARY CHAIN JAISE RED HOT CHILLY PEPPERS METALICA GREENDA TOMPETTY SYSTEM OF A DOWN JOSTRUMMER CONIEWESS JONNY CASH A DELL AND MANY MANY MORE NOT SURPRISINGLY THEREFORE RICK IS CONSIDERED SOMEWHAT OF AN ENIGMA THAT IS PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW IT IS THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL IS ABLE TO EXTRACT THE BEST CREATIVE ARTISTRY FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT JONERAS OF MUSIC WELL AS TODAY'S DISCUSSION REVEALS RICK'S EXPERTISE IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS EXTENDS WELL BEYOND MUSIC IN FACT OUR CONVERSATION TAKES US INTO THE REALM OF WHAT THE CREATIVE PROCESS IS SPECIFICALLY AND GENERALLY A CROSS DOMAINS INCLUDING MUSIC OF COURSE BUT ALSO RITING FILM SCIENCE AN ESSENTIALLY ALL DOMAINS IN WHICH NEW ORIGINAL THOUGHT IDEAS AND PRODUCTION OF ANYTHING BECOMES IMPORTANT OUR CONVERSATION VENTURES FROM ABSTRACT THEMES SUCH AS WHAT IS CREATIVITY IN WHERE DOES IT STEM FROM TO THE MORE CONCRETE EVERY DAY TOOL BASED APPROACHES TO CREATIVITY INCLUDING THOSE THAT RICK HIMSELF MUSES AND THAT HE'S SEEN OTHER PEOPLE USE TO GREAT SUCCESS THAT TOOK US DOWN SOME INCREDIBLE AVENUES RANGING FROM A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SUBCONSCIESS TO HOW THE SUBCONSCIOUS INTERACTS WITH OUR CONSCIOUS MIND AND HOW THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUS MIND INTERACT WITH NATURE AROUND US AND WITHIN US INDEED OUR CONVERSATION GOT RATHER SCIENTIFIC AT TIMES BUT ALL WITH AN IYE AND AN EAR TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE PRACTICAL TOOLS THAT ANY AND ALL OF US CAN USE IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE CREATIVE PROCESS WE ALSO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT RICKS NEW BOOK WHICH IS ALL ABOUT CREATIVITY AND WAYS TO ACCESS CREATIVITY THE TITLE OF THE BOOK IS THE CREATIVE ACT A WAY OF BEING BY RICK REUBEN THIS IS A BOOK THAT I'VE NOW READ THREE TIMES FROM COVEREDTA COVER AND I'M NOW READING AN A FOURTH TIME BECAUSE IT IS SO RICH WITH WISDOM AND INFORMATION THAT I'M APPLYING IN MULTIBLE DOMAINS OF MY LIFE NOT JUST MY WORK BUT MY EVERYDAY LIFE I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY ENOUGH RICK HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO TRANSLATE HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS IN A WAY THAT IS MEANINGFUL FOR ANYBODY SO FURE IN MUSIC IF YOUR MUSICIAN IT WILL CERTAINLY BE MEANINGFUL FOR YOU BUT IT IS NOT ABOUT MUSIC IT IS ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESS AND SO WHETHER OR NOT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF SOMEBODY CREATIVE OR NOT OR WHETHER NOT YOU SEEK TO BE MORE CREATIVE RICK'S BOOK AND TO DAY'S CONVERSATION SHEDS LIGHT ON WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF WHAT MAKES US HUMAN BEINGS THAT IS WHAT ALLOWS US UNLIKE OTHER ANIMALS TO LOOK OUT ON THE LANDSCAPE AROUND US TO EX DAMIN OUR INNER LANDSCAPE AND TO COME UP WITH TRULY NOVEL IDEAS THAT THRILL US ANTERTAIN US ANTERTAIN OTHER PEOPLE SCARE US MAKE US LAUGH MAKE US CRY ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE RICH ARE ESSENTIALLY CONTAINED IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS AND TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND LEARN FROM THE RICK REUBEN HOW THE CREATIVE PROCESS EMERGES IN HIM AND HIS OBSERVATIONS ABOUT HOW IT CAN BEST EMERGE IN OTHERS IS AND WAS TRULY A GIFT SO I'M EXCITED TO SHARE HIS KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU TO DAY ONE THING THAT OU'LL QUICKLY COME TO NOTICE ABOUT TO DAY'S CONVERSATION IS THAT RICK IS INCREDIBLY GENEROUS WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESS IN FACT HE VERY GRACIOUSLY AND SPONTANEOUSLY I SHOULD ADD OFFERED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT CREATIVITY SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESS FOR RICK PLEASE PUT THOSE IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOU TOBE AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE QUESTIONS A BIT EASIER FOR ME TO FIND PLEASE PUT QUESTION FOR RICK REUBEN IN CAPITALS THAN COLAN OR DASH WHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE AND THEN PUT YOUR QUESTION THERE I DO ASK THAT YOU KEEP THE QUESTIONS RELATIVELY SHORT SO THAT I CAN ASK RICK AS MANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE WE WILL RECORD THAT CONVERSATION AND WE WILL POST IT AS A CLIP ON THE HUBERMAN LAP CLIPS CHANNEL BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE OF THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POD CAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR WSALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TO ELECTOROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT' ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH RICK REUBEN CRATE TO HAVE Y HER TO DERICH THANK YOU FOR HAVING MEDS PLEASURE OF ALL THE TOPICS IN SCIENCE AND IN PARTICULAR IN NERV SCIENCE I CONFESS THE CREATIVITY IS THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE TO CAPTURE BECAUSE AN YOU CAN FIND PAPERS SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT IS ON CONVERGEN THINKING VERSES DIVERGEN THINKING AND THEIR DEFINITIONS TO THESE TAKE ON DIFFERENT FORMS BUT IN IT ET STRICT DEFINITION FORM IT SEEMS THAT CREATIVITY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH I THER REARRANGING EXISTING ELEMENTS OR COMING UP WITH NEW ELEMENTS BUT AS I WHEN INTO YOUR BOOK WHICH I'VE DONE TWICE I'VE READ IT TWICE AND BY WIT I FEEL SO BLEST AN HONOR TOAVE GOTTIN IN EARLY COPY FROM YOU IM OR A FINAL COPY EARLY THAT IS BUT HAVING GONE THROUGH IT TWICE I'M NOW CONVINCED THAT THE'RE MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE AN INTERNAL SOURCE OF CREATIVITY THAT EXISTS ON ITS OWN WRITE AND AND THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GIVE THAT FOR ME REALLY IS SERVING AS AN ANCHOR AND TELL ME IF I'M WRONG HERE IS THIS IDEA THAT IDEAS AND CREATIVITY OR LIOLBIT LIKE A CLOUD IF YOU LOOK OUT AT IT ONE MOMENT YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ONE THING WHERE IT HAS A CERTAIN SHAPE AND TEXTURE BUT THEN YOU LOOK AT IT A MOMENT LATER CO BE QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT AND IF YOU LOOK AT AN HOUR LATER IT VERY WELL COULD BE GONE AND THE THE REASON I THINK THAT SERVES AS SUCH A POWERFUL HOOK FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT CREATIVITY IN WHY I THINK NERA SCIENTISTS AND SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY CAPTURED AWAY THAT EVEN TALK ABOUT CREATIVITY A STEMS FROM SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNEW IN PERSON BUT THAT AS YOU KNOW I'VE GREATLY ADMIRE I DON'T HAVE MANY HEROES BUT I WOULD PUT JOE STRUMMER AMONG THE SHORT LIST OF HEROES THAT I HAVE AND I REMEMBER ONCE AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM FAIRLY DISJOINTED I HE WAS SORT OF A YOU KNOW OFTEN DIFFERENT TANGENCS THAT I COULDN'T FOLLOW BUT AT ONE POINT HE JUST CAN AE BLURTED OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA YOU HAVE TO WRITE IT DOWN AND YOU MAYND UP THROWING IT AWAY BUT IF YOU WAIT IT WILL BE GONE AND I REMEMBER THAT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I HAVE ALLD SYSTEM THAT I USED TO TRY IND CAPTURE IDEAS BUT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT JOE SAID THIS CLOUD IDEA THAT COMES UP IM IN ONE FORM IN ONE AREA THE BOOK BUT THEN I THINK IT'S THREAD THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IN DIFFERENT WAYS NO HOW DID THAT COME TO YOU AND IM AND HOW DOES IT SERVE YOU AN TRENIX I ONT SAY EXTRACT WOULD TRY TO ACCESS CREATIVITY I THINK THE BEST WAY TOF THINK ABOUT IT IS LIKE A DREAM S F IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR DREAMS THEY DON'T THEY DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU WAKE UP YOU'LL REBE MIGHT REMEMBER PART BUT NOT THE WHOLE THING THEN IF YOU START WRITING THEM DOWN THE'LL THEY'L THEY'LL COME BACK AND THEY MAY NOT MAKE SENSE TO YOU THE THER THEY'LL BE UM A SERIES OF ABSTRACT IMAGES AND MAY MENO MAY BE SOME DAY IN THE FUTURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY MEAN AND MAYBE NOT AND THATS SORT OF HOUSE THE ART MAKING AH PROCESS WORKS IS LIKE MAKING THINGS AND WE'RE LOOKI FOR FEELING IN OURSELVES AND IT'S IT COULD BE FEELING OF EXCITEMENT OR ENTHUSIASM A FEELING OF INTEREST A FEELING OF CURIOSITY ON ONE NO MORE AM FEELING OF LEADING FORWARD AND WEV WERE FOLLOWING THAT ENERGY IN OUR BODY WE FEEL BE THIS THERE'S SOMETHING HERE THERES SOMETHING HERE I WANTING O WANT I WANTIN NO WAN I ANTIN NO MORE ANU BUT IT'S NOT IT'S I' SAY IT'S NOT AN INTELLECTUAL PROCESS IS A DIFFERENT THING THAT'S WHAT'S IT'S HARD EVEN TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S SO A ELUSIVE YOU KNOW RECENTLY I WAS LISTENING TO A PODCASS BY OUR FRIEND AM LEX FREEDMAN THIN WHO IS IN EPISODE WI BOLOGY SRINA VISAN WHERE THIS IT WOULD BOLOGY WHO'S A INVESTORA TYPE GUY THINKER TYPE GUY UM THIS IS LIKE AN AIT OUR APISODE HE SAYS SOMETING INTHE BEGINNING THAT I'D LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HE SAID LOK YOU KNOW WE CAN TRAIN A RAT TO LEVER PRESS EVERY OTHER TIME OR TO EXPECT REWARD AND EVERY EVEN NUMBER PRESS WHERE EVERY ODD NUMBER PRESSOR EVENT EVEN EVERY FIFTH NUMBER PRESS BUT A HUMAN AND A RAT CAN'T DO THAT FOR LIKE PRIME NUMBER PRESSES YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY TRAIN THAT AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE REWARD SYSTEMS AN THE WAY THAT WE FOLLOW LIFE FROM WHEN WE GET UP UNTIL WE GO TO SLEEP AND WHAT HE SAID IS THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T DO THAT MEANS THAT WE MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE IN TOUCH WITH THE BEST SCHEDUALS OF DOING THINGS LIKE EVERY TIME I'M THIRSTY I TAKE A SET I ASSUME THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT BUT IT MAY NOT BE OPTIMLE RIGHT OPTEM FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE WHEN I WAS READING YOUR BOOK I'V SINKING ABOUT THERE'S AT THERE'S A THERE'S A  SET OF THINGS TO FOLLOW THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO YOU TALK ABY THIS THINGS TO ACCESS THAT NONE OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS COMES FROM JUST WITHIN US IT CAN BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEING FED BY THINGS OUTSIDE OF IT AND SO WHAT I'D STARD TO DO IS THE SECOND TIME I READ THROUGH THE BOOK WAS THINK ABOUT IT THROUGH THE LENDS OF WHAT BOLOGY WAS SAYING WAS THAT THERE MAY NOT EVEN BE A LANGUAGE FOR THIS THING THAT WE CALL ACCESSING CREATIVITY I MEAN THERE'S A PROCESS BUT THAT LANGUAGE IN THE FORM OF WORDS IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE UM TRYING TO USE EVEN NUMBERS TO TRY AN ACCESS PRIME NUMBER SIS LIKE THE THE MATH BECOME SO CONVOLUDED THAT WE END UP IN A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS WHERE I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN GET TO THE COLONELS OF IT BECAUSE IN WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT THE BOOK IS THAT YOU DO OU YOU SHOW AND IN FORM THE PROCESS BUT THERE MAY NOT BE A ENGLISH OR ANY OTHER LANGUAGE FOR SAYING DO THIS THAN THIS THAN THIS THAN THIS AND YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING OF CREATIVE VALUE YO THAT CAPTURE IT YES I THINK LANGUAGE IS INSUFFICIENT INSUFFICIENT TO TO DRILL DOWN ON CRATIVITY IT'S MORE UM IT'S CLOSER TO MAGIC THAN IT IS A SCIENCE SO WHEN KIDS COME INTO THE WORLD U DO YOU THINK THAT THEY HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO THIS CREATIVE PROCESS THAN WE DO AS ADULTS BECAUSE WE START TO IMPART RULE PLAYS AND BOOKS LIKE WELL IT GET LIKES WELL PEOPLE LIKE IT BUT ALSO UM LIKE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US THAT WE'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO LIKE THE TEXTURE OF THIS TABLE RIHT THEY WE'RE DISCARDING THINGS IT COME SYSTEMATICALLY WE GET COTICOSET IN OUR WAYS DO YOU THINK KIDS ARE MORE ARE JUST BY DEFINITION AND BY DESIGN MORE CREATIVE THAN THEDULT YES IT KIDS ARE THEY'RE OPEN AND THEY HAVE NO BAGGAGE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BELIEF SYSTEM THEY DON'T KNOWT HOW THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK UM THEY JUST SEE WHAT IS AND IF WE PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS WE LEARN WE LEARN MUCH MORE THAN IF WE A MOST OF US SELECT FRUM AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF DATAPOINTS AVAILABLE TO US TO WELL AS AS A SPECIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DIE AND TO PROCREATE AND TO FEED OURSELVES OR PROBABLY THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS FIRST AND THEN AND THEN WE LEARN THINGS ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT IN WHAT'S WRONG AND WE LEARN THINGS ABOUT A HOW TO DO CERTAIN THINGS OR WE'RE INSPIRED BY SOMEONE WHO MAKE SOMETHING WE LOVE AND WE WANT TO DO IT THE WAY THEY DO IT AND ALL O THOSE THINGS UNDER MIND THE PURITY OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS THEY CAN BE UM TOOLS TO BUILD YOUR SKILL SET TO BE ABLE TO DO IT YOURSELF LIKE IF YOU'RE A A A SINGER YOU MIGHT IMITATE A SINGER YOU REALLY LIKE FOR A WHILE TO GET GOOD AT IT AND THEN EVENTUALLY COME TO FIND YOUR OWN VOICE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS DOESN'T ALWAYS START WITH YOUR OWN VOICE BUT IF YOU'RE THREE YEARS OLD OR FIVE YOURE YORS OLD YOU TRY SINGING YOU'RE NOT SINGING LIKE ANYONE ELSE YOU'RE YOU'RE SINGING WITH YOUR OWN YOUR OWN VOICE AND WHEN YOU MAKE SOMETHING YOU'RE MAKING IT BASED ON NOT NOT KNOWING AND I THINK UM I HAD THE ADVANTAGE EARLY IN MY CREER OF STARTING MAKING MUSIC WITHOUT ANY EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS HELPFUL BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT RULS I WAS BREAKING AND SO IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL BREAKING OF RULES I JUST DID WHAT SEEMED RIHT T ME UM BUT I DID REALIZE THAT I WAS DOING THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE WOULDN'T DO THEN THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT THERE ARE NO NEW IDEAS YOU KNOW I SORT OF DISAGREE YE AS EVERY ONE KNOW ILES HE OR HER SOMETHING THAT IT LEAST SEEMS DIFFERENT ENOUGH M THIN IT'S A A A COMA COMBINATION OF A NEW COMBINATION OF EXISTING IDEAS PRESENTED IN A NEW WAY ITHINK THIS I THINK THAT'S HOW IT WORKS I DON'T KNOW A BUT IT WILL SAY AS SEEM LIKE THINGS THAT ARE MOST INTERESTING TO ME HA A SERIES OF FAMILIAR ELEMENTS JOINED TOGETHER IN A WAY THE DISCREETING SOMETHING A EER SEING BEFORE YOU MENTION THAT IT'S UM THAT WHEN YOU ARE CLOSE TO WHERE YOU HAVE SEE HINTS OF CREATIVITY THAT IS OF REAL VALUE THAT YOU CAN ET THAT IT'S A FEELING AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BODY IS A GREAT SOURCE OF INFORMATION  WHICH UM YOUA ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THE BRAIN OF COURSES IN THE SKULL BUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM EXTENDS EVERYWHERE IN THE BODY THE WHOLE MIND BODY THING JUST FALLS AWAY OU NOVE PHILOSOPHERS OF ARGUED ABOUT THIS FOREVER BUT IT'S A SILLY ARGUMENT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT YOU KNOW GOD FORBID OVER TO IMPUTATE ALL MY LIMBS HAVE THEM IMPUTATED I'D FUNDAMENTALLY STILL BE ME THE SAME IS NOT TRUE IF WE TOOK ABOUT BIG ENOUGH CHUNK OF MY BRAIN AND I STILL SURVIVED I WOULD BE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT HUMAN BEING I STILL HAVE THE SAME NAME AND IDENTITY AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BUT I WOULD BEHAVE VERY DIFFERENTLY UM WHO KNLSE MAYBE BETTER AH THE SIGNALS FROM THE BODY WE KNOW OR AT LEAST WE ASSUME OURE PRETTY GENERIC LIKE I CAN THINK OF FIFTY DIFFERENT WAYS ORE A HUNDRED WAYS THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT CREATIVITY TO DAY AND WE COULD DEFINE IT AND RE DEFINE IT AND CARVE IT UP AND SERVE IT UP LIKE SUTY IN A BONCH A IFFERENT WAYS BUT THE BODY SEND SIGNALS THAT MOST OF US ARE IM WE HAVE A KIND OF COURSE UNDERSTANDING OF IT'S LIKE OE MY STOMACH HURTS ARE MY STOMACH FEELS GOOD OR I'M NOT SENSING MY STOMACH OR IM  THAT FEELS GOOD IF FEELS WARM IT FEELS CO LIKE WAT MOST OF US AREN'T TRAINED IN UNDERSTANDING HOW TO INTERPRET THOSE SIGNALS SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU HAVE A FEW VOWELS A FEU SYLLABLES AND THERE ISN'T A LOT MORE BUT RESNEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR THOUGHTS IN OUR EXPERIENCES DEPENDIN ON HOW HIPE PREVERBAL SOMEBODY IS AND HOW MUCH EMPHASIS THEY PUT ON DIFFERENT SOUNDS IT IT'S KINE OF NEAR INFINITE I IM NOT INFINITE BUN YOUR INFINITE SO FOR YOU PERSONALLY WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE ON THE ON THE THE END OF A THREAD OF CREATIVITY MAY BE LISTENING TO AN ARTIST ARE YOUR OR YOUR HEARING SOMETHING OU ANYOR LIKE THERE AND THE THE YOU'RE UNTEN I START TO TE FLECT IN A CERTAIN WAY RIGHT DO YOU FEEL THAT IN YOUR BODY AS A RECOGNIZABLE SENSATION OR IS IT A THOUGHT AND A SENSATION IT'S A IT'S A FEELING IN MY BODY IS IT LOW IS IT LOCALIZED NO IT'S INSO IT'S A FEELING OF UM I WUS IT'S A A SURGE OF ENERGY DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME YOU EXPERIENCE THAT PROBLY DOU NO HEARING TH BEATLES WHEN I WAS THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD THREE OR FOUR YEARS OL HER WELL Y IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME THAT THE BEETLES HAVE NEVER DONE IT FOR ME I MAYBE JUST WEREAN EXPOSED THA DIRECT TIME IN THE RIGHT WAY IT'S IS NO NTE RED O WRONG WAY AND AND EVERYONE UM I CAN LOVE THE BEATLES AND YOU CANNOT AND WE'RE BOTH RIGHT IN O THISS NATA I'M GLAD WE CAN STILL BE FRANDS ASLE AND SIR IS ALL SCAR DA THAT QUESTION I KNOW MY TASTE OF MUSIC IS A L OFIT OBSCURE BUT I'M AND AN GON FRAGMENTARY BUT IM OOKET GUT I'M ALWAYS FELT LIKE CASH THERE MUSTN'T BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH E I LIKE THEIR SONGS BUT THEY DON'T THERE'S NO JUSE FOR ME ERE I THINK MAYBE L WATCH EM IT WAS A AND A PART SERIOUS CALL THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY WHICH IS AT A PRINT BUT I I CAN TRY TO FIND IT SOMEWHERE AND WE CAN WATCH AT TOGETHER AN MAYBE THATLE MAKE THE CASE FOR THE BEATLES K YED BE I MEN NOTHING AGAINST THEM AS JUST AND I'M ALWAYS BOTHING YOUF FR STORY THAT LIKE RAMONDS I SAW THAT S LIKE WHA LIKE JANE'S EIDIATORS EVERYONE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR LAST NAME TO RAMN A LOT OF THEM HATED EACH OTHER THERE'S OT SO MUCH DRAMA AND THERE AND AND THREE CORDS AND JUST BUT TO ME IT JUST WAS LIKE WHALE LIKE KIDS FROM NEW YORK THAT ENERGY SO I THING IT DIFFERENT THINGS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY SO THAT BRINGS ME TO A QUESTION OF WHEN WHEN SOMETHING FEELS CREATIVELY RIGHT AND YOU'RE SENSING IT AND I'M AND YOU'RE THERE WHAT SAY IN THE STUDIO OR MAYBE BEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY SENT YOU HOWD HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE THAT GIVEIN THE ABSENCE OF A LANGUAGE HA HOW DO YOU TRANSLATE THAT INTO A CONVERSATION WITH THE ARTIST AND AGAIN THIS COULD BE ABOUT WRITING OR COMEDY OR YOU NOR SCIENCE OR PODCASTING THAT MATTER HOW DO YOU SAY THAT KEEP GOING THAT WAY WHEN THEY MIG NOT EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT HE DID IT AND I'M GESSING A LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T YE SOMETIMES IT DON'T IT DEPENDS WHEN WE'RE IN THE I'LL TRY TO BE IN IN A SETTING WHERE AS WHERE TALKING ABOUT IT WE CAN ENGAGE WITH IT IN THAT MOMENT SIT'S NOT MUCH GOOD UM BUT SAY I WAS PRODUCING YOUR NEW RECORD AND YOU PLAYED ME SOMETHING AND I HAD SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT IT IT WOULDN'T BE SO HELPFUL FOR ME TO TELL YOU WHAT THOSE WERE IT BE BETTER FOR US TO WAIT TILL WERE IN A PLACE WHERE WE CULD TRY THINGS AND SEE WHERE IT GOES I'M SO THE FIRST THING IS I WOULDN'T RELY ON LANGUAGE TO DO IT IT WOULD BE MORE OF A MAKING A SUGGESTION OF SOMETHING THAT'S ACTIONABLE WE TRY IT AND THEN WE HAVE MORE DATA AND EITHER WERE MOVING IN A GOOD DIRECTION OR REMOVING AWAY FROM RE MOVING TOWARDS IT OR AWAY FROM IT AND WE NEVER KNOW AND SO IT'S ALWAYS AN EXPERIMENT AND MAYBE SIMPLE WAY TO TALK ABOUT IT WOULD BE LIKE UM IF I GAVE YOU TO DISHES OF FOOD AND ASK YOU TO TASTE THEM AND TELL ME WHICH WHEN YOU LIKE BETTER IT'S PRETTY USUALLYS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES WICH OU LIKE BETTER AND I THINK MOST CREATIVITY CAN BE BOILED DOWN TO THAT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THEN I WONDER HOW THIS IS GAN A PERFORM   ON CERTAIN SOCIAL MEDIAT PLATFORMS THAT'S A DIFFERENT THEN WHAT IS IT WHEN I'M TASTING THESE TWO THINGS WHICH IS WHEN I WANT E FINISH EATING AND AND IF I WERE TO SAY I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER BUT IT NEEDS LITTLE SALT AND THEN PUT A LITTLE SALT ON IT LIKE MAYBE A PTOO MUCH SALT AND YOU' HEN YOU KNOW YOU TASTE THAT'S LIKE IT'S IT'S THAT SIMPLE A BEING IN TUNE ENOUGH WITH OURSELVES TO REALLY KNOW HOW WE FEEL IN THE FACE OF KNOWING THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL VERY DIFFERENTLY WHICH IS PART OF THE CHALLENGEIS LIKE OF IF EVERYONE TELLS YOU A A A A A  A AND YOU LISTENING YOU LIKE THAT'S BE A AS AN ARTIST IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO ME IT'S BE AND THAT'S A IT'S A DISCONNECT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF YOU KNOW WHEN WE GO TO SCHOOL IT'S TO GET US TO FOLLOW THE RULES AND IN ART IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE THE RULES ARE THERE AS A SCAFFOLDING TO BE A CHIPPED AWAY AS NEED BE SOMETIMES THE'RE HELPFUL SOMETIMES ORE NOT AND SOMETIMES WILL EVEN IMPOSE OUR OWN RULES TO GIVE SOMETHING IT'S SHAPE SO WE CAN DECIDE TO MAKE A AF WEEN TO MAKE A PAINTING BUT WE'RE ONLY GOING TO USE A GREEN AN RET OR THE ONLY CLOTHES WERE WERE ALLOWED TO USE WE DECIDE THAT IN ADVANCE AND THEND HOW TO WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM KNOWING ALL WE HAVE AS GREEN AND RED AII CAN BECAUSE OTHERWISE IF THERE'S AN INFINITE NUMBER OF CHOICES ANYTHING CAN BE ANYTHING YOU KNOWS LIKE IT'S IT'S OF SOMETIMES MORE CHOICES IS NOT BETTER SO LIMITING YOUR PALIT TO SOMETHING MANAGEABLE FORCES YOU TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN A DIFFERENT WAY NOW IN ARE A IN OUR DIGITAL AGE A MUSICWISE YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING A DIGITILY HERE'S NO LIKE IN IN THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GUITARN STUDYO YOU COULDN'T RECORD GUITAR OR IF YOU DIDN'T IF YOU COULDN'T HIRER AN ORCHESTRA THERE COULDN'T BE YORKSTRA ON YOUR ACCORDING NOW YOU CAN JUST CALL ANY OF THOSE THINGS UP SO THERE'S INFINITE CHOICES AND INFINITE CHOICES DON'T NECES SARILY LEAD TO BETTER A BETTER COMPOSITIONS OR BETTER FINAL A FINAL WORKS UNDERSTANDING HALF HOW YOU FEEL IN THE FACE OF OTHER VOICES WITHOUT SUCAN GUESSING YOURSELF IS PROBABLY THE SINGLEMOST IMPORTANT UMTHING TO PRACTISE AS AN ARTIST ORE SKILL SET TO DEVELOP IS AN ARTISTIS TO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL AND ON YOUR FEELINGS AND AND THE KEE TO THAT IS NOT I KNOW SO I KNOW WHAT TRIKE FOR YOU IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY ITS JUST I KNOW FROM ME AND THE REASON I CHOSE TO BE AN ARTIST IS TO DEMONSTRATE THIS IS HOW I SEE IT IF I'M IF I'M UNDERMINDING MY TASTE FOR SOM COMMERCIAL IDEA OR AH IT IT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF DOING THIS THIS IS NOT AT'S NOT WHAT THIS PROCESSIS ABOUT THIS PROCESS IS I'M DOING ME AND I'M SHOWING YOU WHO I AM AND YOU CAN LIKE IT OR NOT BUT EITHER WAY THIS IS STILL HOW I SEE IT I LOVE THAT BECAUSE SOM IN SCIENCE IN HAVING TRAINED GRADUATES YUNES HAVING BEEN A GRADUATES TO I WAS VERY BLESSED O HAVE MENTORS ONE OF WHO IS A REAL ICONICLASS HE'S DEAD NOW UM I SHEALT ALL MY ADVISERS ARE DEAD UM SOIS I CANSWER CANSWER THE JOKE AS YOU DON'T WANT ME TO WORK FOR YOU STHEY WERE ALL HAD A MORBID SENSE OF HUMOR SO THEI'R LAUGHING ABOUT THIS SOME PLACE RIGHT NOW UM  THAT YOU CAN TO SAY THEY ILL ATE THE POISON MUSHROOM NO THE LAST ONE A SAID TO ME YOU'RE THE COMMON DENOMINATOR ANDREW AND I THOUGHT O MY GOODNESS AND HE SAID KIND OF JUST GETTING BUT NOT REALLY AND NO THAT'S A LOW OF IT YEARY BUT IN ANY CASE UM HE HE ALWAYS SAID I SEEM WAS BEEN HE ALWAYS SAID THE'RE THE ONE THING I CAN'T TEACH IS TASTE AND THE ONE PREDICTOR I HAVE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER DEVELOP IT ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PERFECTIONIST BECAUSE THE'RE FILTERING THEIR PERFECT PERFECTIONISTS THAT FILTER THEIR PERFECTION THROUGH THE FEED BACK OF OTHERS HE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE PERSON THAT WAS T PUTTING UP A LITL BIT OF A MIDDLE FINGER TO FEED BACK NOT SO MUCH T AT THEY WOULD GET THINGS WRONG CANN'T CAN BE BADLY WRONG IN SCIENCE YOU CAN BE WRONG FOR THE RIGHT REASONS BE CAN ALSO BE FOR THE WRONG REASONS BUT PEOPLE THAT JUST HAD ALMOST A COMPULSION TO DO IT THEIR WAY OR TO BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY WE'RE DOING AND I I'M HEARING SOME OF THAT UM OR I'M HEARING THAT IN WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING I I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUMAN EMPATHIC PROCESS OR THE EMOTIONAL PROCESS WHERE WHEN WE SEE SOMEBODY DOING SOMETHING AND THEY SEEM TO REALLY NOT BE PAYING ATTENTIONTO WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS DOING MENT I GUESS THAT THE CRAZY PERSON ON THE STREET IS ONE AVERSION OF IT WHERE WE GO THERE JUST IN THEIR EXPERIENCE AND JUST CRAZY BUT WHEN SOMEBODY SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING THEMSELVES OR THE EMOTION SEEMS TO BE REAL I THINK THERE ARE ARE A GOOD FRACTION OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL A KIND OF GRAVITATIONAL PULL E GO HAVE THAT IN THE BEST EXAMPLE I HAVE OF THIS AS I REMEMBER GROWING UP IN THE SCAPEWARD THING WE WERE THE FIRST WE WERE THE FIRST START DOING THE BAGGY LIKE SAGGING THA CLOTHES THINK WE OUGHT TEASED ENDLESSLY ONE EAR IN SCHOOL THEN THERE WAS A BUNCH A HYPPOT THAT CAME OUT AGUIES WERE WEARING SAGGING THERE THEIR GENES ARE THE SHORT NEXT YEARE WE COME BACK AND THE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING FUN OF US WE'RE ALL DOING IT AND THAT'S WHEN T A IT CLICKED FOR ME IS THI MOST PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY LIKE NO THEY LIKE WHAT THEY LIKE BECAUSE OF THE CERTAINTY OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LIKE AND ON SO THE QUESTION THAT IS IN THIS AM LANDSCAPE OF CREATIVE STOFF WHAT'S REAL WHAT'S NOT REAL ON YOU KNOW THESE ARE IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHOEVER CAN CREATE THE MOST CONVINCING STORY AT LEAST CAPTURES A GOOD NUMBER OF OF A GOOD FRACTION OF AUDIENCES BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE CREATIVE ARTISAN US TO DO THE ANANT ACTUALLY DEPART FROM THAT DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT WIT THIR JUST TWO DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE A COMING UP WITH THA STORY WITH THE PURPOSE OF PLEASING SOME ONE ELSE I'S A SKILL SAID BUT IT'S MORE OF A C IT'S MORE OF A COMMERCIAL ENDEAVOR THAN AN ARTISTIC IN NEVER THAT'S A TACTICAL YET I WA SEING IT IN YOUR BOOK YOU DESCRIBE AGAIN WHENYTHING ABOUT IT THE CREATIVE PROCESSES THE CLOUD FOR ME AGAIN INTO SERVISAS SUCH A POWERFUL ANCHOR AND THEN I THINK ABOUT THE THE BIOLOGY THE NEURBIOLOGY OF LIKE STRATEGY FORMATION OR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AND THEN ALMOST BY CHEER LUCK OR MIRACULOUSLY I TURN A FEW PAGES LATER INTO THE BOOK AND THERE'S A DESCRIPTION OF HOW ANIMALS THAT ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING EAT MATE FIND WATER E ACCOMPLISH THERE THE'RE THE REQUIREMENTS OF LIVING IT REQUIRES A NARROW VISUAL FOCUS THIS IS SOMETHING MY LAUVH IS KIND OF OBSESSED WITH AN IVBEEN OBSESSOR AND IN THAT MORE NARROW VISUAL FOCUS WE KNOW THAT THE THE PLAY BOOK BECOMES MORE NARROW THE RULE SET IS MORE NARROW NOW AT SOME POINT IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH A NEW CREATIVE IDEA THAT MEANS BROADENING VISION IS ESSENTIAL IN SOME WAY A BROADENING THINKING WAT IT COULD EITHER BE ABROADENING OR NARROWING BUT IT'S CHANGING THE APERTURE FROM THE STANDARD THE REASON WE DO THOUS IS TO PRESENT SOMETHING KNEW THAT MAYBE YOU ALREADY KNEW BUT DIDN'T KNOW YOU KNEW IT AND FOR THAT TO BE THE CASE IF TO BE LOOKING AT IT'S NOT UNLIKE WHAT A COMMITIAN DOES AND A COMMEDIAN MAKES YO LAUGH USUALLY WITH THEY'RE SAYING IT'S OUTRAGEOUS BUT YOU'VE KNOW THAT IT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW JUST KNO INCESSAT THAT WAY OR NOWN AS SAIT IT THAT WAY BEFORE BUT IT'S ALWAYS THE TRUTH IN IT THAT MAKES IT FUNNY IT'S IT'S LIKE THAT IT'S THE SAME IT'S THE SAME IDEA IS RECOGNIZING SOMETHING THAT' SEEMS REALLY OBVIOUS ONCE YOU SEE IT BUT SEEMS LIKE NOBODY ELSE SEES IT OR NO ONE ELSE POINTS IT OW AND I FEELIC SCIENCES LIKE THAT TOO WE HOW MUCH OF SCIENCE WHEN ONCE THE AYOU KNOW THERE THE LIGHT FLASHES OVER YOUR HEADS THIK I GOT IT OF RIT JUST SEEMS LIKE  I WE KNEW THAT FOR EVER NO ONE KNEW IT BUT DOYOU NOW NEVER SAYG AS TIK I SO OBVIOUS IT'S SO OBVIOUS AND I THINK ANOTHER THE SUPERPOWER OF HARNESSES IS IS EXCEPTING WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING  WHEN WE THINK WE KNOW THINGS THAT ALSO LIMITS ARE OUR WORLD WE THINK WE KNOW IT'S ONLY LIKE THIS THIS IS ALL IT'S POSSIBLE WE'RE MICI THIS LITTLE BOX BUT IN REALITY WHO'S TO SAY THAT'S THAT'S THE CASE WHO'S TO SAY ANY OF THE WE COULD TAKE ALL OF THE A WHAT WE BELIEVE IN SCIENCE NOW AND DECIDE TO THROW ALL F THAT AWAY AND START FROM SCRATCH AND WE PROBLY CREATED DIFFERENT A WHOLE DIFFERENT ONE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITAMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL F YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STORY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH ORE GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MEAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS ENOTHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE RIGHPT IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSDOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIND THAT'S TATHLETIC GRENSDOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY O VITEMIND THREE K TO IN A OFF LINE CONVERSATION UM ONE TIME YOU ASKE A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S BEEN A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST ED CHANG IS CHAIR OF NERO SURGERY AND ONE I IWULD PLACE HIM IN THE TOP TOP ONE PERCENT OF NEROSCIENTIST UKNOWS PULLING SPEECH OUT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLETELY PARALYZED WIT LOCKED IN SENDRUMENT CETER AND YOU ASKED HIM A WHAT PERCENTAGE OF WHAT'S CONTAINED IN MEDICAL TEX BOOKS AND TRAINING TO DAY TO DAY IF YOU WENTO MEDICAL ETTLE TO DAY RIGT AND YOU LEARNED WHAT WAS IN THE TEXTBOOK WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT INFORMATION IS ACCURATE N PERCENTAGEIST NOW AND HE SAID MAY BEHALF RIGHT AND YOU ASKED AND WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT AND HE SAID INCALCULABLE AND I I COMPLETELY AGREE AND UM AND ASKED HIM A SECOND TIME AND HE STILL CAME UP AT THE SAME ANSWER SO THAT'S A GOOD SINE IM RELIABILITY FROM EXPERIMENT TO THE NEXT IS GOOD YET I THINK THAT THE THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT WE REALLY KNOW THINGS UM IN SCIENCE EMEN YOU SEE WE'VE OBSERVED AMAZING DISCOVERIES FROM CHANCE WE'VE OBSERVED AMAZING DISCOVERIES UM FROM INCREDIBLE BOUTS OF HARD WORK IN BOTH CASES PEOPLE WRE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN THE LAP NO ONE WALKED IN THE LAP SAW SOMETHING ONE DAY AND HAD A KNOBELL PRIZE WHENING DISCOVERY OR FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY THEY WERE ALL HANGING OUT IN LABAE LOT JUST SOME OF THEM UM CAME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T EXPECT OTHERS WERE WERE DRILLING TOWARD AN ANSWER AND IN ALL THOSE CASES WHEN THE BREAKTHERS HAPPEN I'M GUESSING I DON'T KNOW THIS THAT CONSIDERING WE WE ASSUME THIS INFORMATION THEN THIS DISCOVERY I'S TRUE BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT BUT IF EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT IS WRONG THEN THE DISCOVERIES ARE PROBABLY BUILT ON A THE KNOW I'M SAYING IT'S LIKE THA THAT THE CONTEXT  EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE CONTEXT THAT IT SITTING IN IT IT'S IN THAT CONTEXT YAT CONTEXT ISN'T RIGHT WHO KNOWS WE DON'T KNOW SO I'M SAYING WERE TO WE'RE TOO CLOSE TO MOST THINGS IN THINKING WHEN WE NOTE WHEN WE THINK WE KNOW THINGS WE'RE THEY'RE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO IT ANM AT ANY NEW DISCOVERIES ORE ESSENTIALLY BUILT ON TOP OF THESE BELIEFS YOU KNOW BUT THEY'RE BELIEFS I REMEMBER AM YOU KNOW LEARNT OF COURSE I LISTENE THE BEASY BOYS GROWING OUT RUDENOS CHILD THE NINETIES AND THEY WERE IN THE IN  SAVATAGE WAS YOU SERVE AN OUTGROWTH OF E SCAPEWORDING MOVY LIKE SPIKE JONES AND LIKE THE GIRL MOVIES AND THOSE WORLDS THAT BESEBOYS N SCAPE WARING WERE WERE REALLY CLOSELY INTERWOVEN FOR WHILE SOME PEOPLE KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T IN SPITE SORT OF FORM THE BRIDGE AND THEN SPIKE WEN OFF THA START MAKING MORE TRTIT BIGGER MOVIES AM THE MORE PEOPLE WATCH BUT YLET'S JUS USE THEM AS AN EXAMPLE I HEARD YOU SAY ONCE BEFORE THAT YEN GESWERE KIND OF JOKING AROUND LIKE BEASY BOYS LIKE YOU KNOW THESE GUISES DOING HIPPOP IT AS CONN LIKE THE HARD QUARSESEEN IN NEW YORK PUNKROC SEEN AND OW A SORT OF A JOKE THEREWRA LOT OF INSIDE JOKES WHEN YOU WERE WORKING TOGETHER WAS THERE THE THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE MIGHT LOVE IT MIGHT HATE IT OR YOU JUST WARN'T PAYING ATTENTION AT ALL WERE' PAYING ATTENTION AT ALL NEVER CONSIDERED IT THE YOU KNOWM AT THAT POINTING TIME WHEN YOU'RE MAKING I CONILL HIPPOT ME USIC WASI TINY UNDERGROUND THING AND IT WAS NO ONE MAKING HYPPOP AT THAT TIME THOUGHT IT WOULD EVER MEAN ANYTHING IT WAS IT WAS NOT REALIST THIC THOUGHT SO WE WERE MAKING IT REALLY FOR OUR CRAZY FRIENDS THAT'S IT SO YOU THINK NOWADAYS THE FACT THAT ONE CAN CREATE SOMETHING AND QUOTI  RELEASE IT QUICKLY I CAN PUT IT SOMETHING OUT ON TO TWITTER INSTER GRAM NOW YOU DII IN TEN SACONDS FROM NOW AND I WILL GET IMMEDIATE FEED BACK THAT THAT THAT WHICH IS EXTERNAL IF YOU BACK OF COURSE BUT THEN I CAN ITERATE ON THE BASIS OF THAT FEED BACK TO YOU THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR THAT LARGER OPPORTUNITY FOR CREATIVITY IN OTHER WORDS IF WE WERE TO GO BACK TWENTY YEARS OR EVEN FIFTEEN YEARS WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY CREATE TO CREATE WAS CERTAINLY STILL THERE BUT YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HOW IT WAS GIN A LAND UNTIL YOU QUOTIC RELEASED AT THERE WAS IT SEEMS TO ME THERE WAS MORE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN THAT MAGICAL NA RAIN FOREST THAT IS THE THE THE CREATIVITY ITSELF I DON'T THINK IT'S WRONG OR RIGHT IT'S JUST IT'S MORE INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN USE OR NOT USE AND USE IT IN A USEFUL WAY AND AND YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING IN COULD IT OUT AND PEOPLE COUND NOT LIKE ITING I COOD HEY STILL DON'T GET IT HORE I MEN  I GOT O GO HARDER A NO LIKE I GOT TO GO HARDER IN THAT DIRECTION NOT DO YOU KNO AT I'M SAYING IT'S LIKE THAT UM TO REACT A WAY FROM INFORMATION CAN BE HELPFUL IT CAN BE HELPFUL WHEN UM TERE COULD BE DIFFERENT STORIES THAT HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME WERE MAKING SOMETHING AND YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT IT IS AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE ENGAGE WITH IT AND MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT IDEA OF WHAT IT IS AND THEY LIKE IT FOR DIFFERENT REASON THAN YOU DID OR DISLIKE IT FOR A REASON DIFFERENT THAN THE REASON YOU LIKE IT WE CAN'T CONTROL ANY O THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW THE ONLY PART OF IT THAT WE CAN CONTROL IS HOW WE RELATE O THE THING THAT WE MAKE AND ANY EXTERNAL INFORMATION THAT UNDERMINES THE CLARITY OF THAT CONNECTION IS PROBABLY BAD FOR THE ART IS MY IS MY CES AND AND AGAIN I I'M ONLY THINGS FROM MY EXPERIENCE LIKE I TRY TO MAKE THINGS ALL I'VE EVER TRIED TO MAKE WERE WAS SOMETHING I LIKE OR SOMETHING THAT I FELT LIKE WAS MISSING AS A FAN THAT I WANTED AND I NOBODY WAS MAKING IT SO I I'LL MAKE IT YOU KNOW BUT IT WASN'T UM IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE SERVICE OF I LOVE THIS THING I WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS NO ONE ELSE'S MAKING ONE AVE TO MAKE ONE THAT'S A IT'S BEAUTIFUL CAUSE I THE WORTHA KEEPS COMING TO MINE IS THIS IT'S ALMOST LIKE A COMPULSION LIKE THERR THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS OF WAYS TO BE AND TO BEHAVE INTO FUNCTION AND WORK AND LIK BUT THER' IF SOMETHING'S A COMPULSION IT BEYANKS US AWAY FROM THOSE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES JUST ENOUGH THAT WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO IT YOU'VE TALK BEFORE ABOUT AND YOU TALK IN THE BOOK THIS NOTION OF THE SOURCE IN I TO ME  AGAIN I CAN'T HELP ABUT MY NARRAW SCIENTIST LENDS ON THIS I THINK OF UM THE SOURCE AS NOT ONE BRAIN AREA BUT SOME FUNCTION WITHIN THE BRAIN WHERE WE WE'RE IN TOUCH WITH OUR ABOUT BODILY'S SIGNALS IWHAT FEELS RIGHT WHAT DOESN'T NOT LIKE TASTING THE TWO FOODS I LOVE THAT EXAMPLE AND THAT IT'S A IT'S A PLAY BOOK THAT IS FAR MORE VAST THAN THE THE SHORT TURM ADAPT IF PLAY BOOK LIKE THIS HOW MEN GET FROM POINAD TO POINT TE AND YET WHEN I LISTEN TO AN ALBOMER A SONG I MAN I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THERE AT SOME POINT IT BECOMES NOT STRATAGY DEVELOPMENT OR CREATIVITY BUT STRATAGY IMPLEMENTATION LIKE THERENEEDS TO BE LIKE THA SONGS ARE G TO COME IN THIS ORDER AND I I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MUSIC I'VE MY MUSICIAN FRIENDS AR ALWAYS YOU KNOW EVER AN EITHER S A IT'S NOT SO MUCHY ABOUT USI OER THAT THAM RIGHT WELL WELL PUT AM BUT THE ORDERING OF THE SEQUENCE OF THE MELODI IS ET CETERA SO AT WHAT POINT TE DOES ONE DESIDE OQUET LIKE NOW'S A TIME TO GET INTO THAT MORE NARROW FOCUS OF OF EFFORT I WE'VE GOT IT LET'S RUN WITH IS BECAUSE THERE IS A COMPONEENT AT CREATIVE PROCESS INVALVES PACKAGING AND FINISHING AND UM IS THAT PART LESS SATISFYING TO YOU OR IS IT JUST ALL PART OF THE SAME LARGER ART IT'S NO PART OF THE SAME IT'S IT'S NICE ITE'S A GOOD FEELING IS USUALLY A GOOD FEELING WHEN SOMETHING IS DONE ON THE ONE HAND IT'S SAM IT'S A COMMITMENT BECAUSE UP UNTIL THE TIME THAT YOU SAY IT'S DONE YOU CAN KEEP EXPERIMENTING AND CHANGING IT YOU KNOW F IF YOU THINK WENL MAYBE TO MORE I CAN MAKE IT BETTER EN IT'S NOT FINISHED AND KEEP THINKING THAT FOR A LONG TIME YOU CAN DO THAT FOREVEREND NEVER NEVER PUT OUT ANYTHING SO GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE READY TO SIGN OFF IS A GOOD FEELING UM AND IT ALOUS YOU EN THINKS I TOOK ABOUT MY BOOK IS A BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFICULT THING TO DO IS FUN TO PLAYIN IT'S FUN TO MAYBE IT'S NOT THE BEST THIT COUL BE AT YOU KNOW EM TO USE WHAT EVER THE NEXT PRIJECT IS GON  BE AS MOTIVATION TO FINISH THE WON YOU'RE WORKING ON NOW I I'M WORKING ON THIS AN SPENDING ALL OF MY TIME ON THIS THING IT'S REALLY GOOD I BELIEVE IT CAN BE BETTER BUT IS TIS OTHER THING THAT I REALLY WANT TO MAKE AND IF I KEEP TINKERING WITH THIS WHEN I'L NEVER GET TO MAKE THE OTHER ONE SO USING OTHER PROJECTS AS A IMPETUS TO FINISH SOMETHING AND RELEASE IT INTO THE WORLD'S GOOD ONE AND YOU SAID THE YOUR DESCRIPTION OF OF SOURCE IS SOMETHING IN US UM AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD ACCURATE IF I WOULD SEE THAT WAS ACCURATE IT'S DEFINATELY IN US TOO BUT IT'S NOT ONLY IN US AND IT'S UM I THINK OF SOURCE AS THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE OF EVERYTHING AND IT'S HOW EVERYTHING EXISTS HOW THE TREES GROW AND WHY THER MOUNTAINS AND ANYTHING THAT WE CAN SEE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND AND EVERY DISCOVERY AND EVERY PIECE OF ART AND EVERY A NEW DESIGN AND EVERY MACHINE ARE ALL OUTGROWS OF THIS SOURCE ENERGY OUR PART OF IT IS THE ANTENNA THAT LIKE CONNECTS TO IT AND AND MAY BE WEARTHY UN WERE THE THE VEHICLE FOR SOURCE TOO ALLOW THINGS TO HAPPEN IN THE WORLD THEND THANK YOU FOR THAT CAUSE I I DID INDEED MISSPEAK BECAUSE I RECALL VERY DISTINCTLY IN THE BOOK HE DESCRIBED HOW YET THE PHYSICAL WORLD IS CONSTRAINED IT BY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND CERTAIN THINGS ARE THE IMAGINATION IS UNCONSTRAINED AND YOU THINK I HAVE THIS WRITE THESE SO THAT YOEN THE WORK SIT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THOSE IT'S NEITHER OF ONE NOR THE OTHER BUT THAT ULTIMATELY WHAT FEEDS IN TO ALL OF THAT OUR IMAGINATION AND THE WAY INDEED THAT ARE OUR BRAIN IS A PHYSICAL ENTITY THAT NATURE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD PROVIDES AT LEAST WHAT APPEARS TO BE NEAR INFINITE IF NOT INFINITE OPTIONS AND I LOVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE COLOR PALETE THAT IF WE RESTRICT ME TO WHATEVER SORTS OF PAINTS OR MEDIUM I HAVE THAN UM IT'S RESTRICTED BUT IN NATURE THERE'S A AN INFINITE NUMBER OF SHADES AND TONES AND COMBINATIONS AND EVEN ON ONE YOU KNOW WE PICK UP A ROCK AND LOOK AT THE COLOR OF THE ROCK AND TRIED TO FIND A PAINT TO MATCH THAT ROCK IT WOULD NEVER MATCH IR'S TOO MUCH T THE'RE TOO MANY VARIATIONS IN NATURE WITHIN A SINGLE COLOR ROCK UM FOR US TO GET CLOSE IS IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION WE WE SCRATCH THE SURFACE WE'RE ONLY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE AND WE LOVE WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO PEER IN AT DIFFERENT SCALES SPACIAL SCALES TIMES SCALES TO BUT SPACIAL SCALES THE DELIGHT THAT COMES FROM THAT YOU KNOW THAT THESE NATURE PICTURE SEEM LIKE THE WERE MORE THIES IN THE EIGHTIES I CR YOU SEE A DROP OF OIL SHOT AT HIGH VERY HIGH RESOLUTION THERE'S BEAUTY IN A DROP OF OIL AND THEN YOU'D SEE THAT THE EARTH AND THE GALICSY THERE'S BEAUTY IN THAT TOO RIT  EXTREMES I'M AN OF COURSE ARE DAILY PERCEPTION IS MOSTLY THROUGH THE FILTER OF THESE KINDS OF INTERACTIONS WALLS AND SOMETIMES OUTDOORS THERE'S A UM A B BRILLIANT NURROW SCIENTISTS AND IM NOT SURPRISINGLY HE HAS A NOBELL HIS NAME AS RICHARD AXL HE'S AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSIY UM IS OUTRAGEOUS PERSONALITY UM CHOOSE NIKARETT NON STOP UM YOUGUES WE GET ALONG GREAT NOT BECAUSE OF THE NIKERET BUT BECAUS UM HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS IS IS VERY ABSTRACT FOR A GUY WHO'S SOLVED A HE WONT THE NOBELL FOR SOLVING A OF GREAT PROBLEM WITHIN HOW WE SMELL UM PERCEPTION OF ODORS AND TASTE AND HE SAYS YOU TH EVERYTHING THAT THE BRAIN DOES AS AN ABSTRACTION THINK I COULD TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOUR FACE AND SHOW IT T YOUSA YET THAT'S ME OR LET'S SAY FOR THE MOMENT I CALL MYSELF AN ABSTRACT ARTIST LES JUST PLAY A GAME BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING AN ARTIST BUT AND I DO THREE DOTS AND AS QUIGLY LINE AND I SAY THAT'S YOU AND YOU SAY LAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ME AND I SAY BUT THAT'S MY ABSTRACTION OF YOU LOOK ET WITH HA BRAIN ESSENTIALLY DOES THAT IAS ER SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU IN MY BRAIN IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF NURON'S PLAYING WHAT WE CALL IN ON SOMBLE LIKE A DIFFERENT KEYS ON A PIANO AND WE GO RICK I RECOGNIZE YOU RICK RUBEN AND SO EVERYTHING IS AN ABSTRACTION AND IT'S ONLY ONCE WE START TINKERING WITH THE PARTS AND THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF SCIENCE TO REMOVE AND ADD AND MANIPULATE AND THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN COME UP WITH WOULD BE A ROTHGO  I ONLY COME OVER THIS EXAMPLE CAUSE I START OFF IN VISION SCIENCE AND MAYBE  SO MAKE THE MOST SENSE TO EVERYONE EXCEPT THE FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN BLIND SINCE BIRTH AND THEY CAN SWAP SOMETHING IN HERE THE IF I SHOW YOU A ROTHGO AND I DON'T TELL YOU IT'S A ROTHGO YOU MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY THINK IT'S THAT IMPRESSIVE T DEPENDS ON YOUR TASTE IN ART BUT WHAT ROTHGO DID WHICH WAS AMAZING EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE ROTHGOES AND I HAPPEN TO IS THAT HE REMOVED ALL THE WHITE AND HIGH CONTRASTY STUFF AND WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU ALTER COLOR SPACE AND SO THE COLORS LOOK VERY DIFFERENT SOME PEOPLE SAW THAT DRESS A FEW YEARS AGO IS IT ORANGER IS A GOLD OR WHATEVER THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF THE SAME PHENOMENON I DOUBT IN FACT I'V BE WILLING TO BET MY LEFT ARM THAT ROTHGO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE NURROW SCIENCE OF COLORD PERCEPTION BUT SOMEHOW GOT TO THIS PLACE WHERE IF THERE WAS NO CANVAS SHOWING AND NO HIGH CONTRAST AND THE PAINTINGS WERE LARGE ENOUGH AND ON THE APPROPRIATE WALL YOU SAW THEM A CERTAIN WAY THAT TAPPED INTO SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL AND THIS IS WHERE I THINK ART AND SCIENCE REALLY CONVERGE IS THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WE SEE SOMETHING THAT FEELS AMAZING TO ENOUGH PEOPLE AND NOT JUST LIKE THE BAGGY PANTS PHENOMENON NOT JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE THINK IT'S COOL BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE AND AGAIN THATIS DEFIES LANGUAGE AND AT I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT IN YOU'RE A YOUR YEARS OF OF LIGHT AND MUSIC AND OTHER CREATIVE ENDEAVORS THAT YOU'VE THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE TO YOU HAVE YOU EVER ENCOUNTERED SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL KEEP SHOWING UP INDIFFERENT FORM OR THERE'S SOMETHIN ON LIKE A LIKE A ALMOST LIKE A RULE WER A PRINCIPALE IS IT EVER COME ABOUT CAUSE IN SCIENCE WE THING OF THIS AS LIKE THIS IT REVEALS SOMETHING ABOUT OUR LIMITATION TOU ABSTRACT THE WORLD I HOPE I MADE THAT CLEAR M NOT EXACTLY BUT I HAVE A THOUGHT YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE OF THE DROP OF OIL THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DROP OF OIL AND THE PHOTOGRAPH OF ORD WE COULD USE THE ON THE OTHER SIDE LIKE HUBLE TELESCOPE IMAGES OF THESE THESE VAST THINGS AND I I DEFINITION WHAT WE SEE EVERY DAY IS AS IMPRESSIVE AS THOSE THINGS BUT WHERE NUMB TO THEM BECAUSE WE SEE THEM ALL THE TIME AND IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT DROPS OF OIL EVERY DAY IN IN A MICROSCOPE A A MONTH FROM NOW WE WOULD NOT WE WOULD NOT FIND WONDER IN THAT IMAGE SO IT'S SOMETIMES IT'S THE NOVELTY OF NOT SEEING IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE BEFORE THAT'S REALLY THRILLING YOU COULD AND I COULD IMAGINE AND AS PROBABLY RELATES TO THE ROTHCO IDEA THAT YOU COULD SEE SOMETHING FROM A PARTICULAR ANGLE AND HAVE THIS MAGICAL EXPERIENCE AND THEN WALK THREE FEET TO THE SIDE AND SEE IT FROM A DIFFERENT WAN IT JUST EVAPORATES IT ONLY WORKS IT ONLY TRIGGERS THIS THING IN US A WHEN WE LOOK AT IT JUST THE RIGHT WAY U THERE WAS A PAINT THA N EXPERIMENT I JUST HEARD ABOUT HEARD ABOUT THE OTHER DAY THAT THAT SOUNDS FASCINATING THAT U A PAINTING TEACHER RECOMMENDED WHERE INSTEAD OF PAINTING YOU KNOW HAVING A MODEL IN THE ROOM AND PAINTING THE MODEL THAT YOU HAVE THE MODEL IN THE NEXT ROOM AND YOU GO INTO THE NEXT ROOM WITHOUT YOUR EQUIPMENT YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR EQUIPMENT AND YOU CAN STUDY THE MODEL FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT AND THEN YOU GO INTO A DIFFERENT ROOM WERE YOU CAN'T SEE THE MODEL AND PAINT THE MODEL INSTEAD OF AND IT'S IT CHANGES YOUR RELATIONSHIP WHERT'S NOT WE'RE NOT JUST PAINTING THE LINES WE'RE PAINTING WHAT IS INTERESTING ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT I SAW WHAT IS THE DATAPOINTS THAT' STUCK IN MIND MIND AND WHEN I STRING THOSE TOGETHER WHAT O I GET AND AND WHAT DO I HOW DO I FORM IT TO GET AS CLOSE TO WHATEVER THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THAT PERSON WAS WHICH THE CLOSE THE CLOSEST TO OF GETTING TO THE EXPERIENCE OF THAT PERSON IN THE PAINTING MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE A PHOTOGRAPH YOU KNOW IT MIGHT LOOK MORE DIFFERENT THEN MORE THE SAME TO REALLY SEE WHAT YOU SEE THIS IF WE THINK ABOUT THEM THE PECOTL PAINTINGS THAT WERE INSPIRED BY AFRICAN ART WERE THE EYES ARE UNDIFFERENT DIFFERENT LEVELS THEY MAY GIVE US MORE INFORMATION THAN A PHOTOGRAPH WOULD GIVE US AM THINKING ABOUT THE EWHEN YOU ERE DESCRIBING THE SENSATION OF WHIN SOMETHING PIXES YOUR BREATH AWAY AND WE ALL HAVE THAT WHEN WE SEE A DRAMATIC SUNSET ANY ONE YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S A REALLY DRAMATIC SUNSET OR IF THERE'S A WHALE AND IF ANY ONE'S ON THE BEACH AND THERE'S A WHALE EVERYBODY'S REALLY INTERESTED THAT THERE'S A WHALE IT'S DENOT IM SAYING THESE FEELINGS OF WONDER WE GET TO EXPERIENCE THEM DEPENDING ON WHERE WE ARE WERE YOU KNOW DRAGON FLY WE'RE A BIRD FLIES INTO YOUR SPACE THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND WHEN THEY HAPPEN LIKE WE'RE WE'RE AH CONFRONTED WITH THE THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD WHEN WE CHANGE THE PERSPECTIVE NORMALLY WE DON'T THINK OF WHALES IN OUR BACK YARD OR BIRDS IN OUR HOUSE YOU KNOW FLYING FREELY BUT BUT THEY DO HAPPEN THESE THINGS DO HAPPEN AND THEY THEY LIKE BREAK US OUT OF OUR TRANCE WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN  OH YA THE'RE BIRDS LIKE THIS EVERYWHERE I'M JUST NOT PAYING ATTENTION THISGUIS COMING INTELLECT TAP ME ON THE SHOULDER THAK REMEMBER ME HERE I AM YOU KNOW SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE WHALE EXAMPLE AND WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS IT'S REVEALING TO US HOW IN A DELIGHTFUL WAY HOW DEFICIENT OUR PERCEPTINAL FILTERS NORMALLY ARE YES IT'S A LITTLE BUT LIKE THE ROTHGO IS REVEALING HOW I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT THIS WAY UNTIL THIS MOMENT IS REVEALING TO US HOW COLOR NORMALLY LOOKS AS ACTUALLY FIRST ALL NOT THE ONLY WAY IT LOOKS THOSE COLORS WE THINK OUR ONE WAY BUT ALL COLOR THITS GETS INTO THE BIOLOGY OF COLORVISIONS ALL ABOUT CONTRAST WHAT SOMETHING IS NEXT TO DICTATES WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THAN THAT'S THE ORIGIN OF THAT DRESS MEM OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT I STILL CAN'T FIRG GROUT EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN AS SOME ONE WILL FRENCHLLY TELL ME THE IN THE SAME WAY WHEN YOU SEE A WHALE AND IT'S DELIGHTFUL I THINK IT'S REVEALING TO US THE EXTENT WHICH THOSE WHALES ARE THET OCEAN IS VAST THERE'S A WHOLE UNIVERSE THERE AND WE ARE BLIND TO IT ALL THE TIME AND I THINK THE MISPERCEPTION OR THE MISCONCEPTIONS GIVES ME AS THAT WERE DELIGHTING CAUSE WE SEE THE WHALE WE MIGHT BE JUST AS DELIGHTED BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING HIT WITH THE CONTRAST OF HOW LITTLE WE RECOGNIZE ALL THE TIME AND IN THAT WAY IT REMINDS ME ALOF IT ABOUT COMEDY WE'RE AND IVS I'VE BEEN WATCHING MORE COMEDY LATELY AND  SOMETIMES IT'S THE SHOCK SOMETIMES IT'S THE THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH THAT'S REVEALED AND THEN OTHER TIMES WHAT I'VE NOTICED AND I SAW ROGUE INTO COMEDY AT THE VULCAN CLUB IN AUSTEN WHICH HE DOES EVERY ONE'S A WHILE AND IT WIS SMALL CLUB IN AND HE WAS LEADING OUT THIS STORY DURING HIS ROUTINE OR BIT I THINK IT IS RIGHT THIS BIT HE'S LEADI AND EVERYONE KNEW WHERE IT WAS GOING WE ALL KNEW AND THEN WHEN HE FINALLY TOLD US IT WAS EXACTLY WHERE WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING AND IT WAS HILARIOS AND IF O GOOD AND IT FELT AMAZING AND I AND I THOUGHT IN THAIN THAT MOMENT I WAS LIKE WAY SICOND HOW DID HE PULL THAT OFF THAT WAS MASTERFUL BECAUSES NORMALLY IT'S THIS THING LIKE YOU CREATE ONE STORY THERE'S LIKE A SCRIPTING OUT ALMOST LIKE A COURTROOM LAWYER AND THEN THAT KIND OF PULL THE CURTAIN AND IT' SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT'S THEAND AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE SCIENCE THE NARROW SCIENCE AND BRAIN IMAGING OF OF LAUGHTER AND HUMOR WHICH I'VE LOOKED INTO'TO BE HONEST AND NOTICE RESPECTED THE PEOPLE IN THAT FEEL IT'S PRETTY LAME IT'S LAME BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS THAT THE JARRING NATURE OF A SURPRISE BUT WHAT HE LED US TO WAS SOMETHING THAT OH NO HE'S ACTUALLY GOING THERE O HE'S REALLY GOING THERE AND IT WAS THIS ANTICIPATION WITH A WITH A BEAUTIFUL DELIVERY AT THE END AND SO I'M CONVINCED THAT BA SOM WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING WE THINK IT'S ABOUT THAT BUT THAT THE THE DELIGHT THAT WE FEEL COULD BE ABOUT ALL THE OTHER EXPERIENCES THAT NOW BECOME IN A SUBCONSCIOUS WAY AND OF LIKE HAH IT'S ALMOST LIKE LAUGHING AT THIS PERCEPTIONABL DEF AS IT THAT WE HAV IT'S ALMOST LIKE LAUGHING AT HOW LITTLE WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHICH IS WHAT YOU'VE SAID IT IT COULD BE BETTER ALSO COULD BE TE SENSE OF COMMUNITY OF WHEN YOU THINK IT'S CINIGA PARTICULAR WAY AND IT GOES THAT WAY IT'S LIKE REINFORCEMENT OF YOU E OS O UE I YET WE HE SAING IT BUT IN WE WERE SAING IT TOGETHER I'M LISTENING HEU SING IT BUT WER IN THIS TOGETHER NAT'S GOOD FEELING TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR SECOND I WAS TRY TO THINK ABOUT WISE CERTAIN MUSIC I'M STILL CAN EVOKE SUCH POWERFUL EMOTIONS IN ME AND AND THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE MUSIC WE LISTEN TO WHEN WE ARE TEAN AGERS YOU KNOW FROM ABOUT YOU KNOW FOURTEENE UNTIL ABOUT TWENTY FIVE IT SEEMS TO GET ROUTED INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN SOME WAY MAYBE BECAUSE THAT FASE OF OUR LIFE IS IS REALLY ONE OF IDENTITY CRISIS AND AND YOU DON'T FIND TOO MANY FORTY YEAR OLDS SOME WHO ARE WONDERING LIKE WHO THEY ARE OCCASIONALLY BUT ALMOST EVERY YOUNG TEANAGER OR PRETEINE AND SNO LIKE WHO AM I YOU'RE JIVED FINDING PERSONALITY SO I ALWAYS LIKENED IT TO THAT BUT LEAVING OUT THE THE SORT OF CRITICAL PERIOD BIOLOGY STUFF WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT THE MUSIC THAT WE HERE AT THAT TIME ARE WE THAT MUCH MORE EMOTIONALLY TUNED HAVE WE NOT SHUT DOWN OUR CENSORS QUITE AS MUCH IS THERE THE SONGS IN THE ARTISTS DON'T MATTER TO THE VERY INDIVIDUAL TO ME OTHIT FOR OTHER PEOPLE 'LL BE THE BEATLES OR SOMETHING I'M NOW I JUST REALLY WISH THE BE LES DID IT FOR ME TOO BUT M DO YOU THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I COULD SEE HOW IT'S REALLY TERRIFIC I COULD ALSO SEE HOW IT SETS UP U ONE OF THESE WHAT A'LL JUST USE NURTY LANGUAGER CALLD AT I LIKE A SEMY DEPRIVED FILTER BECAUSE IF I'M ONLY LOOKING FOR THE WAY THAT LIKE A STIFF LITTLE FINGERS TRACK MADE ME FEEL THE FIRST TIME I LISTEN TO ON'S FIFTEEN THE FEELING IS WORTH WHILE BUT IF I'M LOOKING FOR THAT I'M MISSING ALL THE OTHER STUFF I'M MISSING THE BEETLES I'N MISSING FLEET WOOD MACK WHICH NEVER DID IT FOR ME EITHER I'M LIKE A MISSING ALL THE STUFF THAT YOU DON'T PEOPLE I LOVE IN RESPECT REALLY LOVE SO IM I'VE NEVER WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE'S KIND OF A INFINITE UM TREASURE TROVE OF OTHER THINGS THAT I DO LOVE BUT I DO SOMETIMES WONDER WHETHER 'R NOT MY LIFE EXPERIENCES DIMINISH BECAUSE I'M NOT ALLOWING U CON RANGE AND YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY WORK IN A HUGE NUMBER DIFFERENT JONERAS OF MUSIC PONK IS ONETHING HIPPOP IS N IM IT YOU'LL DIAMOND TOO RIGHT EMANEM TO SLIGHER TOO RIGHT AAND IN SOMESENSE AS I LIST THESE OFF I'M JUST THING ABOUT HOW MUCH IN HIGH SCHOOL MAYBE NOWADAYS LESS SO BUT EVEN IN COLLEGEIND IS AN ADULT WE SOCIETILY WERE SORT OF ASKED TO CONSTRAIN OURSELVES TO ONE OF THESE GROUPS I I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS OKAY TO LOVE BOB DILLIN AND LOVE PONCROCK AS MUCH AS I DO UNTIL I HEARD TIM ARMSTRONG SAID HE LOVE BOBD DILLIN AND A'LLS LIKE AND RECENTLY Y TOLD ME HE LOVES THE GRATEFUL DEAD AND ALLS LIKE WO ABUT TO IT I REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD TO M I BOTH E REMONS AND  CLASH LOVED BEETLES SO MININ A I O WORK TO THE MINO  YOU TOGETHERDOK  SOO SO I'VE A FEELING PART OF IT IS THE RUSON IT GETS IN AT THAT AGE IS IS AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE DEFINING WHO WE ARE AND THE MUSIC IS PART OF THE DEFINITION OF HOW WE SEE OURSELVES SO IT'S THE BIK THE MUSIC THAT WE HEAR BEFORE THAT MIGHT BE THE MUSIC THAT'S ON ARADIA OR OUR PARENTS MUSIC ORUR OLDER BROTHER SISTERS MUSIC AN MEN WHEN YOU'R FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN AND YOU START CHOOSING WOL YOUR YOU'RE LISTENING TO IS LIKE NOCE FINALLY MINE AND MY PARENTS MIGHT NOT LIKE IT AND MY ELDER BROTHERS SISTERS MAY OR MAY NOT LIKE IT BUT THIS ONE IS MINE AND YU IT ALWAYS HA IT ALWAYS HAS THAT A IMPRESSION IN US THAT THIS IS THIS IS OURS IT'S MY  IT'S MY THOUGHT A WOCK OF WYAT IT LUCK WHY CONTINUES TO LAST YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU WIPE THE SLATE CREEN THEN LIFE SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOUARE GOING O GOING IN WORK WITH SOMEBODY KNEW AND AGAIN AS PEOPLE ARE HEARING THIS I HOPE THAT THEY'RE TRANSPLANTING THIS TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY DO CAUSE IN THE REALM OF SCIENCE AND PODCASTING COMMUNICATION THAT IT'S NOT MUSIC BUT UM THERE'S A CONTOUR IN AAWAY YOU KNOW HOPELITIST POGCAST WILL LOOK NOTHING LIKE IT DOES IN FIVE YEARS THAT'S MY HOPE IS IT WILL STILL HAVE THE COOR FEATURES OF THE BEAUTY AND YOU T ILITY OF BIOLOGY COMING THROUGH BUT I HOPE IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE EPISODE TOO AND I THINK IT'LL EVOLVE AS YOU VOVE IT'S JUST THE TRUER IT IS TO WHAT INTERESTS YOU AND IF YOU'ARE NOT INTERETING BIOLOGY THE SAME WAY IN FIVE YEARS I WOULD HOPE IT'S NOT THE SAME I'LL BE DOING PSYCHOANALYSIS IN REAL TIME  WUT IF VERITY WILL ALY LYING DOWN ON COUT WHAT EVER IT IS IWN EVER ITI YE WE PROBABLY WON'T BE ON PSYCHODELICS BUT WE MIGHT BE LEVITATING YOU NSO HOW DO YOU A STUCKLE OF IT IF YOU WOULD CAUSE I KNOW IT I'M VERY INTERESTED IN A YOUR PROCESS I I'LL SPARE YOU THE DAILY ROUTINE A QUESTION IT'S VERY CLICHET BUT YOU AND I ARE BOTH LOVERS OF SUNLIGHT OF HORIZONS AND NOT AS A TRIVIAL SOURCE AS AN AMAZING UM GIFT OF ENERGY RIGHT AM IN IT IN THERE AREN'T WORDS FOR IT REALLY U ASIDE FROM YOUR DAILY ROUTINES UM WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW SOMEBODYYOU'RE GOING FROM PROJECT TO PROJECT AND AND YOU KOW YOURE CON BE DOING WORK WITH SOMEBODY COULD BE YOUR OWN WORK AND WILL TALK ABOUT THE WRITING OF THIS BOOK AND IT'S STRUCTURE WHICH IS VERY UNIQUE I'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED A BOOK WITH THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE BEFORE AND IS THET IT'S THE MOST FACILE READ EVER AND YET EVERY SINGLE PAGE I UNDERLINE TOOK NOTE STARVD AND LIKE IT AS YOU'D NOTICE IT'S VERY WARN HAVE A VERY VERY WARN ALREADY AND ONLY MORE SOOVER TIME DO YOU HAVE A PROCESS FOR IN A REMOVING THE FUNCTIONS OF THE DAY AND THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING LAST WEEK AND WHAT'S GOING ON AND UM IN ORDER TO GET MORE ACCESS TO THE THIS SUM I GONG TO THINK OF IT NOW MORES AS A RECEIVER INSIDE OF YOU RIGHT ALMOST LIKE IT TUNING A RADIO UCAND THEN IT COMES IN LIKE THE BEGINNING OF LIKE A DROM ER CLASH I LOVE THE RADIO JO LOV THE RADIO WRIGT THE COTR AND THAN IT COMES IN CLEAR AND THERE IT IS HOW DO YOU CLEAR THE STATIC WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL STEPS THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE MORE UM GENERALIZABLE TO REGARD LESS OF WERS U SOMEBODY AND YOU KNOW UM AFRIDAS LISTENING THERE'S THE THING WHEN I'M WHEN I ENGAGEE IN AR PARTICULAR PROJECT WHATEVER IT IS I I DEDICATE ALL OF MYSELF FOR THAT PREED OF TIME WHATEVER IT IS WHETHER IT BE TWENTY MINUTES OR WHETHER IT BE FIVE HOURS WHATEVER IT IS UM TOTAL FOCUSS AND KNOW UM OUTSIDE DISTRACTION WHATSOEVER AND WHEN I LEAVE THAT PROCESS I DO MY BEST NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT WHEN I'M AWAY FROM IT I DON'T BRING ANY MATERIALS WITH ME I DON'T LEAVE THE STUDIO WID WORKS IN PROGRESS IND SPEND TIMELESSING TO THEM DURING THE DAY OR LOOKING FOR IDEAS S I I STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM IT WHEN I'M NOT DDIRECTLY ENGAGING IN IT AS POSSIBLE AND IN THE BEST OF SITUATIONS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO TOTALLY ENGAGE MYSELF IN IN BETWEEN SO INSTEAD OF WORKING ON PROJECT AY FOR FIVE HOURS AND THEN LEAVING IN DOING NOTHING I'M HOPING TO ENGAGE IN A PROJECT BE OR BE S IND WITH ALL OF MYSELF BEFORE GOING BACK TO PROJECT AY AGAIN WHICH MIGHT BE THE NEXT DAY LET'S I TO AM RELATES TO AN AMAZING A CHAPTER IN SERIES OF WRITINGS I YOUR BUK THAT I'M NOT GOING TISCRIVINGS I WANT PEOPLE TO FIND FOR THEMSELVES ABOUT DISENGAGING ABOUT DISENGAGING FROM THE PROCESS ONE QUESTION I HAD AS I READ THAT CHAPTER AND AS YOU'R SAYING THISS NOW IS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE DISENGAGED DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE SELF CONSCIOUS AS WORKING IT THROUGH THAT I BELIEVE SO I BELIEVE SO AND I THINK IN GENERAL TO STE OVER PROBLEM IS NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THINK TO HOLD THE PROBLEMIS LIGETLY AND AND IF AND WHEN I SAY A PROBLEM YOU KNOWIN WHERE AN WAS STARTING A PROJECT IS USUALLY THIS FEELING OF UM THERE'S A QUESTION MARK AT THE BEGINNING OF OAREPROJECT  I AM ALWAYS ANXIOUS WHEN I START ANNY PROJECT BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEAS CAN HAPPEN I NEVER KNOW I KNEVER I NEVER AS I MAY HAVE IN SOME CASES A POTENTIAL BACK A PLAN IF YOU KNOW IF NOTHING WORKS BUT I REALLY TRY NOT EVEN TO HAVE THAT IT'S I PREFER NOT TO HAVE THAT I PREFER TO GO IN MAYBE TO COMT MYSELF DOWN ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SHOW UP THEY'LL BE AN IDEA OF LIKE AN NOTHING WORKS MAYBE WE COULD TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIT'S BUT THAT WOULD ONLY BE FOR MY OWN ANXIETY THAT WOULD IT WOULDN'T BE FOR ACTUAL PRACTICALLY HES UM BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A SENSE OF ANXIETY BECAUSE I KNOW WHATEVER'S CAN O HAPPEN IS COMPLETE THE AUT OMY CONTROL SOMETHINGS CAN SOMETHING EITHER INTERESTING OR NOT WILL APPEAR AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THAT WHEREVER IT GOES AND IN TILL SOMETHING APPEARS FOR US TO FOLLOW I HAVE A LOT OF ANXIETY EVEN THOUGH I KNW EVEN TOUGH IT HAS NEVER NOT COME NOW IT AS COME EVERY TIME BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT CAUSE I ALSO FEEL LIKE THERE MIGHT BE EXPECTATION ON ME THAT I'M NA MAKE IT HAPPEN AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT HAPPENING THAT'S NOT HOW WORKS IT'S IT'S EM I SHOW UP READY FOR IT TO HAPPEN AND A'M OPING TO WHATEVER WE HAVE TO DO TO FIND THAT FIRST THREAD AND ONCE WE FIND THE THREAD THENCE AO IKE WE HAVE A AND THAT THREAD MAY LEAD US TO ANYTHING OUD O COULD LEAD US TO IN A MILLION DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING THAT GLIMMER THAT IT'S NOT A BLAN WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A BLANK PAGE OU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT OKE WE HAVE A WE HAVE A THE BEGINNINGS OF A I WOULD SAY A MAP BUT IT'S A MAP WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT TAKES US AND IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING IT'S JUST LIKE IT'S JUST A STUP YOU KNOW YOU ARE HERE  WHATIS I IF YOU HAVEA MAPPINESSES YOU ARE HERE EVEN IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE DIRECTIONS KNOWING WHERE WE ARE FEELS O K A AND ONCE WE GET UNUSUALLY IT BEGAN USUALLY IN THE FIRST DAY FIRST COUPLOF DAYS IT HAPPENS A BUT UP INTIL THENITS IT'S REALLY AND ANXIETY PRODUCING A SITUATION AND THEN I CANT CON REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL QUESTIONS I THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF OF SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT I DO OU REMEMBER WHAT YOU ASKED I REMER YET WELL IIN WEARE TIME OUT DISENGAGING AND IS YOU'R SUBCONSCIOUS INTO IT AND YHEU AND THEN WE WERE TULKING ABOUT YOU KNOW TO I LOVE THIS A SORT LIKE WONDER WHAT IS YOUR PROCESS OF AF WADING INTO THIS THING AND AND YOU'RE REVEALING THAT NOW I'M AN I I THINK OF ANXIETY AS READINESS YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURES OF ANXIETY IT TENDS TO BE A BIT OF A CONSTRICTION OF THE THE VISUAL FIELD INTO MORE OF A NARROW VISION BUT THAT'S APPROPRIATE BECAUSE YOU HAVE WANT TO SHED HAT WHAT'S GOING ON ELSEWHERE AND THEN YOU KNOW EVEN WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE SHAKE SOR THIS LIKE NOT FEELING NO CASE SITTING STILL ANXIETY WAS DESIGNED TO MOBILIZE US AND NOT ALWAYS TO RUN AWAY THIS IS ONE OF THAT I CU IN ARARELY DO I TALK ABOUT THE WORK IN MY OWN LABORATORY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FRANKLY I DIDN'T DISCOVER BUT IT WAS DONE IN MY LABORATORY BUT ITIS BRILLIANT GRADUATES DON'T LINDSEY SALAIY WHO'S NOW AT CALTAK WAS THAT WE CAN OFTEN OBSERVE ANIMALS ORE HUMANS IN VERY HIGH STATES OF ANXIETY AS THEY MOVE FORWARD TOWARD A GOL AND WE ALWAYS THINK OF MOVING FORWARD IS LIKE THIS CALM THING YOU KNOW WE THESE HEROS YO AROSE A PARTS TELLING PEOPLE LIKE A FEW LIKE 'M NOT GETTEN OFF THE BACK THAM NOT LEAVIN THE THE GIVEN UP MY SEAT ON THE BOS OR MOHAMMED ALL  I BET YOU THEY WERE EXPERIENCING TREMENDOUS ANXIETY BUTY WAS IN THE FORWARD TILT AND SO I THINK ANXIETIES IS IS LEAST I'M  COMFORTABLE WHEN WE ARE FORCING OURSELVES TO STAND STILL SO IT'S A IT'S A ACTIVATING ENERGY AND BEYOND THAT BRINGS UP A WORD THAT YOUN I HAVE WRITTEN MY NOTE BOOK AS AN EXTRACTIONOBLE LOT OF THEMES FROM WITHIN THE BOTH THE YOU AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHICH IS IN AND HERE I'M MEAN A SOUND VERY WEST COAST A WO BUT I MEAN IT AS SERIOUSLY IS IT CAN BE STATED THAT I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING IS ENERGATIC MY WE CAN DO THINGS FROM A PLACE OF ANGER WE CAN DO THINGS FROM A PL ACE OF JOY WE CAN DO THINGS FRE ONE PLACE OF DELIGHT IM I I LIKE TO THINK MATURING INTO THE IDEA THAT JOY AND DELIGHT AND LOVE AS AND THE ULTIMATE RESERVOOIR OF ENERGY BUT YOU A LOT OF THE MUSIC I LIKE FROM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WAS BECAUSE OF THE ANGER THAT WAS THREAD INTO IT OR IUM OR THE SADNESS OF YOU THINK OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THAT MUSIC IT'S A RELATIONSHIP OF LOVE OW EAS LISTEN TO THAT TO GET ANGRY NOW YOU LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE YOU LOVED IT AND I FELT LOVED BY IT YES IT'S MATCHED WHERE I WAS AT AT THE AUS IT WAS TRUE TO WHO YOU WERE AND WHERE YOU WERE I KNOW THAT COLLABORATION THERE'S A WONDERFUL CHAPTER ON COLLABORATION THAT BUT IT'S CLABORATION AS YOU MENTION BEFORE WITH THE UNIVERSE NOT WITH OTHERS BUT IN TERMS OF THE ESPECIALLY THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE AND DO WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING WITH ARTISTS IM I DO WONDER AND HERE I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANY A GOSSIP OR STORIES THATS I'VE NEVER BEEN INTERESTED IN GOSSIP I LOVE STORIES BUT I'M NO NIN GOSSIP BUT ONCE YOU SEE THAT THREAD KIND OF DANGLING THERE ANDYOU'RE GOIG IT'S GOING TO GO AFTER THIS AND WERE YOU GRAB ON TO IT IN YU DCANE NOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A MAP AN AN ORIENTATION WITHIN THAT MAP OFTEN WONDER IN A SCIENTISTS ARE COMPLICATED PEOPLE PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE VERY BORING BUT THERE ARE YOE VERY COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN LIVING IN ONE LIMITED RULE SET OF THE PREFUNTAL QUARTECTS THAT'S HOW YOU GET GOOD AT GETTING DEGREES IT'S BY UNDERSTANDING THE RULES OF ACADAMIA AND PLAYING BY THOSE RULES YES IM PEOPLE THINK ER WITH THE RULES YOU GET YOUR RICHARD AXELS WHO ARE VERY PLAYFUL AND HOW THEY GO ABOUT IT BUT THEY ARE SYSTEMATIC HE'S KNOWN FOR RIGOR RIGOR RIGOR I WHEN I THINK OF CREATIFE ARTISTS AND MUSICAL ARTISTS I THINK OF A BIT MORE ZANI OR LOSE IR YOU WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE REMONS AND LIKE WHITHERS ALL AS CHAOS HOW BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE BRILLIANT ARTISTS MUSICAL ARTISTS THAT ARE OUT THERE SEEM TO HAVE SOME CHAOS INSIDE THEM OR THEIR LIVES AREN'T ALWAYS STRUCTURED OFTENTIMES AND SCIENCE TOO BY THE WAY THEARE SUBSTANCE OF USE ISSUES AND PERSONAL LIFE ISSUES HOW SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CONTROL THEY ME TO PLAY THE INSTRUMENTS SAYING ET CETERA HOW DO YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT IN THEM BUT ARE GETTING IN THEIR OWN WAY RIGHT UM AND DO YOU THINK THAT THAT KIND OF THE INTERNAL CHAOS THAT THE LOT OF ARTIST SEEM TO HAVE DO YOU THINK THAT SOMETIMES IS ACTUALLY AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF THE CREATIVITY PICTURE THAT YOU CAN'T DISENTANGLE IT I DON'T THINK SINECENTIAL PIECE IN GENERAL BUT CERTAIN ARTISTS THAT'S THERE THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT UM I WOULD SAY I REALLY GET TO SEE THE CHAOTIC PART OF ARTISTS FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY THEY REALLY SHOW IT TO ME AND MOST OF THEM LI LIKE MOST COMMEDIENCS I KNOW I'M MUCH MORE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TH EN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM IF YOU SEE THE ON STAGE HERE'S MUCH MORE TO IT AND AS MUCH MORM FOCUS ON CRAFT GOING ON AND DIGGING DEEP TEN WOULD NECESSARILY BE OBVIOUS SEE HIM TURN ROUND ON STAGE AVE I'M I'M A FAN OF BOXING TRACK AND FIELD IN BOXING THE SPORTS NOBODY REALLY CARES ABOUT NOW THAT YOUAVE SEE SO POPULAR AND AND TRACK AND FEEL IS AT IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WRESTLING WHEN YOU GO THE PEOPLE THAT THER ARE THERE CAUSE THEY REALLY LOVE IT I WILL TALL ABOUT REST THAN IT A PROFESSIONAL RESTLING UM BUT YOU'L FLOID MAY WEATHERIS A OBVIOUSLY A COLORFUL CHARACTER AND ONE OF THE BEST RECORDS IND BOXING OF ALL TIME AND IF YOU URS BACK AGAIN TO WATCHING HIS STUFF AND AND WHAT ONE SEES IS THE THE CARS AND THE MONEY THAT CALLED LYRID CALL THEMSELVES THE MONEY TEAM YOU KNOW AND THATS SPENDING IN THE AND AND THERE'S ALL THE OUTRAGEOUS STUFF BUT I KNOW SOME ONE WHO IS IN HIS INCAMP WITH HIM I'M WHO ACHALLY WAS A SPARRING PARTNER FOR HIM AND THE LOER HAS IT THEY HAVE VERY CLOSED DOOR A SPARRING I'M ER CAMPS BUT THE LOER IS THAT HE WOULD DO YOU KNOC AS NOWDAYIS IT'S TWELVE THREE MINUTE ROUNDS RIGHT WITH IM AN EN BETWEEN YOU SPEE FIFTEEN BUT NOW NOR A SCIENTIST STEPPED IN AND IT TURNS OUT ALLOW THE DEATHS WERE OCCURRING WHEN IT WAS MORE THAN TWELVE ROUNDS I FOR WHATEVER REASON IT CUT OFF IT AT TWELVE REALLY SEEM TO TRUNCATE THE DEATH THER'RE OTHER THINGS TO IF THE DAD IS A APPARENTLY CORNER MAN WE HAVE SOME ONE ELSE HERE THE POTGASSI KNOWS MORE ABOUT THIS THAN N HE BAST IN IN YOU HAVE THE KID NOT WANTING TO DISAPPOINT THE PARENT ORELATED WITH DEATH THERE'S AM I'LL BUT GET SOME OF THIS WRONG AN AN AN THE TAKAN COME AFTR ME UM BUT IN ANY CASE DIS GY WHO WAS IN FLOD'S CAMP SAID THAT HE WOULD DO THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES OF SPARRING BRINGING IN FRESH SPARRING PARTNERS WITH NO REST THAT HE WOULD RUN THREE OR FOUR TIMES PER TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE DESPITE ALL THE CRITICAL NEED FOR SLEEP THAT HIS TRAINING WAS UNBELIEVABLY INTENSE TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD JUST JUST CHEW OUT CHEW UP IN DESTROY ALL TRAINING PARTNERS AND YET THE PERCEPTION THAT WE SEE IS IT'S KIND OF IT'S PLAYFUL FOR HIM FOR HIM SO IT SOUNDS VERY SIMILAR LIKE WHAT WE SEE IS OFTEN NOT WHAT GOES IN TO IT THAT PEOPLE ARE INTENSELY RIGOROUS AND I THINK IN A WAY FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE IF YOU KNEW YOU WERE FIGHTING SOME ONE WHO WASN'T TAKING IT SERIOUSLY THAT WOULD GIVE YOU SOME CONFIDENCE AND THAT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD THING IF YOUR IF THE PRIRSON WAS ACTUALLY IM WORKING REALLY HARD OUTWORKING YOU INDYOU KNOW IT IN ABDA I FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME SO I KEEP COMING BACK TO IS THAT 'M IMAGINING MY MIND HAVE TWO ENDS OF THE CONTINUUL ONE THAT IS ABOUT FAIRLY NARROW FOKCAS TRAINING TRAINING STRATEGY IND PLEMENTATION CULTIVATING CRAFT BUILDING CRAFF AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS THIS THE CLOUD IT'S VERY NEBULUS RIGHT IN IT I'M THERE'S IS A WORD THAT I I LEARNED FROM A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHEN I WAS DOWN AT THE SALT INSTITUTE WHEN MY LAV WAS THERE AUS HE STUDIES THIS THERE'S THIS PHENOMENON I'M THAT I DON'T WANT TO MISS PRONOUNCE CAUSE THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE BUT THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION IS PERADOLIA AN PARADOLIA IS OUR TENDENCY TO LOOK AT AN AMORFISH SHAPE LIKE A CLOUD OR A TREE AND THINK THAT IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE AN ICE CREAM COMB THE MAN IN THE MOON  AND THAT AGAIN REVEALS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BRAIN WANTS TO PLACE SYMBOLIC FILTERS ON THINGS AND WE NEED THIS RIGHT BECAUSE I SEE YOU WALKIN THE DOOR AND RECK I I RECOGNIZE YOU IN FACT WE HAVE A BRAIN AREA CALLED THE FUSIFORM FACE GIRIS LITERALLY IS A FACE RECOGNITIONARIA AND YOU COULD BE AT ANY ORIENTATION OR I COULD JUST SEE YOUR EYES AND KNOW THAT IT'S YOU A THERE'S A PHENOMENON CALLE PROPOSAGNOSIA WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE FACES THEY CAN DESCRIBE EVERYTHING IN THE FACE BUT THEY'D DON'T KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT IT'S J F K OR MADONNA OR LAKS FREEDMAN IT'S QUIKE THE LISTS QUIKE THE LIST THERE YO GO LACKS IM RUN FOR OFFICE LACKS JUST KIN I'SHARD ENOUGH TO GET YOU TO RESPOND MY TEXT AS IT IS M SO WE HAVE THESE FILTERS SINCE I WE'RE TAKING THIS CLOUD AND WERE WE'RE DECIDING WHAT THINGS ARE YES AND WHATD I WANT TO GO AT DRILL INTO YOUR PROCESS A LITTLE BIT I MORE DEEPLY WHEN YOU APPROACH A PROJECT SO EVERYONE'S MEET EACH OTHER SHAKES HAND HERE THE ENGINEERS WHEN A SIT DOWN WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING CAUS YOUR WORK WITH PROFESSIONALS AND YOU START GOING ARE YOU TRYING TO BE WITH THE CLOUD OR IN THE IMPLEMENTATION LIKE WHERE ARE YOU IN THAT CONTINUUM AND FORGIVE ME IF I'M LIKE TRYING TO U'M SURGICALLY GO INTO YOUR PROCESS IN A WAY THAT WOULD DISTERRUPT IT AN ANYWAY BUT I TRUST YOUVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A WHILE I KNOW THERE'S NOTHIMAN NOT I'M I'M IN THE CLOUD WOULD THE EXCEPTION OF I'M AWARE OF WHAT COULD GO WRONG ON A TECHNICAL SIDE AND I MIGH LIKE IF SOMETHING GOOD THIS HAPPENING I MIGHT LOOK OVER IN MAKTURE THAT WE'RE ROLLING IM SO THAT'S ANL LEAP OVER TO HEARE MOMENTARILY BUT THEN HE AY BE I MAYBE IF I IF I FEW LIKE IF I WAS IN THE MOMENT I WOULD BE IN THE CLOUD AND IF SOMETHING GOOD STARTS HAPPENING IT WOULD TRIGGER SOMETHING IN ME LIKE OH I HOPE THIS IS I HOPE WERE REALLY DOING THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNO IF WE CAN EVER DO THIS AGAIN THAT'LL THAT THAT WOULD BE A THOUGHT I WHEN THE FIRST TIME THE REAL WORLD WOULD COME INTO THE PICTURE WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD AS HAPPENING LET'S NOT LOSE IT AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS DO YOU NEVER BEEN IN AS IN A STUDIO BESIDES HE PODCAST TO YOU DO YOU SAY HE GOTS THAT SOUNDED GOOD A MORE F THAT WHAT YOU WAIT YOU LET THEM CONTINUE BECAUSE IT AS SEE DON'T WANT TO BREAK THER THER FLOW WOULD NEVER WANT O BREAK ANY FLO WHENCE ITS HAPPENING YET ONE SOMETHING'S HAPPENING JUST CONE TO SIT BACK AND WATCH AND O YOU THINK THERE'S RESINENCE LIKE THE THE TEAN OF ENGINEERS AND OTHER PEOPLE KNOW WHEN IT COT UNCLE IS HAPPENING IF EVERYONE'S PAYING ATTENTION YES WHEN EVERYOE'S PAYING ATTENTION IT'S USUALLY PRETTY OBVIOUS SOMETIMES THE THREAD'LL BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN EXPECTED AND MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY WOULD PICK UP ON IT AND THAT MIGHT BE PARTICULAR THAT MIGHT BE PARTICULAR BASED ON MIGHT A STORE AN ARDIST TASTE ORR UM SOME ONE INVOLVEMENT MIGHT SAY THAT WAS TE SI SOME BACT I THINK THIT WAS BETTER THAN WIT THEM WE THOUGHT THAT CAN HAPPEN I THINKOYOU SAID SEVERAL THINGS AND UM IT WAS LIKE YOU SAID ENOUGH FOR THERE TO BE SEVERAL CONVERSATION I SENTY THAT SO I ESPECIALLY WITH YOU I DON'T GET TO SEE YOU AS NEARLY AS OFTEN AS I WOULD LIKE AND SO WHEN I DO I CONFESS THAT I'M A BIT OF A KIT IN A CAND I SHROUT DOWN IN THE BRAIN TELLS A STORIES SO YOU TALKED ABOUT UM I WALK IN CERTAIN DOT APOINTS YOU RECOGNIZE ME BUT IT'S A REAL LIKE LOOKING AT A CLOUD SHORTHAND WE GO THROUGH WE GO THROUGH OUR LIVES DOING THIS ALL DAY WITH EVERYTHING WE SEE AND THE SHORT HAND IN THE CASE OF ME YOU KNOW ME THE SHORT HAND TURNS OUT TO BE RIGHT IT IT CHECKS OU UM IF IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW AND SOMETHING WE'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH SOMETHING HAPPENS WE WE WE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING ON THE STREET SOMETHING HAPPENS AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SOMETHING OUT OF YOU WURD NARRY HAPENS FIRST THING IS IS THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THEN WHAT WE DO IS AGAIN SOBESUBCONSCIOUS UNCONSCIOUSLY I DON'T  IT'S UNCONSCIOUS SUBCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT THINKING WE CREATE A STORY THAT EXPLAINS WHAT JUST HAPPENED A HYPOTHETICAL THAT MAKES IT OKAY THAT WHAT JUST HAPPENED HAPPENED AND OH MAYBE HE'S RUNNING CAS'S DOG RAN WAY AN HE'S CHASING HIS DOG MAYBE THAT'S WHA'S RUNNING AND AS SOON AS WE HAVE THAT THOUGHT OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE WE RELAX BECAUSE NOW IT'S NOT JUST A GUY RUNNING AND THIS IS WEIRD BUT IT'S A GAY RUNNING ALWAYS PRY RUNNING AFTER IS THOUGHT AND NOW WE REGISTER THAT STORY THAT WE JUST MADE UP WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING WE'RE MAKING IT UP AS WHAT HAPPEN AND THEN LATER IN THE DAY IF SOME ONE SAYS HE HAD YOU SEE THAT I RUN OW LETS A YABES CHASING HIS DOG I SAW THAT AND Y YOU WON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT IT WAS THE MAYBE HYPOTHETICAL STORY THAT WAS THE FIRST POSSIBLE EXPLANATION THAT ALLOWED YOU TO CONTINUE WALKING DO OU N NEM SING THAT'S OUR WHOLE LIVES WE ARE WHOLE LIVES ARE REACTING THINGS MAKING UP A STORY WHAT WE THINK MAY HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT REALIZING THAT'S WAT WE'RE DOING I' TEN LIVING THE REST OF OUR LIVES AS IF THAT THING THAT WE MADE UP REALLY HAPPENED AND WE NEVER KNOW I COMPLETELY AGREE WE CONFABULTE FROM BIRTH UNTIL DEATH THERE'S I A WELL OBSERVED PHENOMENON UM AND PEOPLE O MEMORY DEFISITS M YOU SEE THERE'S THE SAD EXAMPLE THIS AND THEN THERE'S THE EVERY DAY TYPICAL NOT'S WHO KNOWS SAD UR NOT SAD EXAMPLE SO FOR INS TANCE IF SOMEBODY HAS A SLIGHT MEMORY DEFS IT WHERE SOMEONE HAS ALTIMERS TO MENSHA THEY'LL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE WHALL WAY AT NIGHT IS AT WHAT YOU DOING HERE THEY'LL SAY OH YOU KNOW I WAS GOING TO GET A GLASS OF WATER BUT THEY'RE WALKING AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE AM PEOPLE WHO ALKOHOLICS WHO DRINK ENOUGH DEVELOPS SONETHE KORSIKOV'S INDRUM WHERE A CERTAIN BRAIN AREA GETS MESSED UP AND YOU'LL ASK HIM A QUESTION I GO WHAT YOU DOING HERE AND THEY WILL COME UP WITH INCREDIBLE STORIES SOMETIMES INTERESTING STORIES THAT HAVE NO BEARING ON REALITY YES N WE THEIR NAME IS BUT DO THEY BELIEVE THEY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT  WITH ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CERTAINTY AND THIS ACTUALLY RELATES TO A LOT OF THE A NOW BETTER UNDERSTOOD CONTROVERSY AROUND REPRESSED MEMORIES TEW YOU CAN ESPECIALLY FROM YOUNG PEOPLE YOU CAN PULL MEMORIES FROM THEM THAT OF THINGS THAT NEVER HAPPENED THIS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED OVER AND OVER AGAINST THE COURTROOMS KNOW TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS NOW BUT THE WHOLE NOTION OF REPRESSED MEMORIES KUYENA WE HAVE VERYERY A A COMPLICATED AREA OF THE LAWAS YOU CAN IMAGINE IM BECAUSE WE WANT WE TEND TO WANT TO TRUST VICTIMS FOR UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS BUT IN TERMS OF ACCURACY OF DETAILS TWO PEOPLE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE SAME OF THE SAME EXPERIENCES IN THIS BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN OU NE EVEN THAT YOU CAN DO WELL IN THE LABORATORIES PRETTY INTERESTING SO AGAIN BECAUSE OF THESE SELECT I FILTERING AND STORY TELLING AND WE ARE THINK OF A SALMAN RUSHTY WHO SAID WE ARE THE STORY TELLING SPECIES HE PROBABLY NOW I WAS CON TE SA RESNORY TOI MACHINES AND THAT'S GREAT YE THINK O WE ARE TH STORY I WOULD SAY THAT THE BIG FIVE IF I HAD TO PICK UPS A BRAIN FUNCTION IS WE ARE VERY LIMITED FILTERS THE MANTIST SHRIMP SEES SIXTY SEVERN SHADES OF RED FOR EVERY ONE THAT WE SEE YESTHEY HAVE ACCESS TO THINGS WE DON'T AV ACCESS TOO YES THEY'RE NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW YOU KNOW RELEASING ALBUMS OF THE YOU KNOW RED HOT CHILLY PEPPERS CALIBER BUT WHO KNOWS MAYBE DOWN THERE THEY ARE I DID SEE SOMETHING BY THE WAY AS A RELEVANT TANGENT RECENTLY AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S LOK I IF EVEN OF IT'S CRAZY IT SUPERCOOL IF YOU TAKE A DEVICE THAT AMPLIFIES THE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS COMING FROM CACTUS AND YOU JUST TRANSLATE THAT INTO A SIMPLE RULE OF CONVERSION TO TWO OR THREE PITCHES OF SOUND THE MUSIC THAT COMES OUT OF IT IS BEAUTIFUL NOTHING SHORT OF YEUREAL AWHEN I SAW THAT THEY THE TEAN AGER AND ME THOUGHT YOU KOWHN WE HEAR WALE SONG WE THINK IT SO BEAUTIFUL LIKE WHA IF THEY'RE JUST LIKE CURSING AT EACH OTHER THE WHOLE TIME I RIGHT ONLY THEY THE'RE IN THERE LIKE I  LIKE A ROGEN EPISODE WHEN HE INVITES ALL HIS COMMEDIAN FRIENDS AND THERE WHO KNOWS MAYBE IT'S A PSYCHOANOLETIC CONVERSATION ABOUT THEIR CHILDHOOD TROMIS I DON'T KNOW YES BUT WE DECIDE WALE SONG IS BEAUTIFUL S WE DECIDE CACTUS AN IS IT LELSE AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO US AND AND W'RE RIGHT THAT IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO US BUT WE IT DOESN'T MEAN WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT'S RIGHT YES WE HAVE THESE FILTERS PERCEPTIONABLE FILTERS WE ONLY CAN SEE IN HEAR SMELL AND TASTE WHAT WE CAN AND THEN THE BRAIN LIKES TO WORK IN SYMBOLS WE TEND TO LIKE TO MATCH THAT PERSON WHOSE SHOES ARE MASSED UP MUST BE HOMELESS UM I'VE HAD A COUPLE INSENSES IN LIFE WHERE I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A HOMELESS VAGRANT INSIDE A BUILDING AND AN ACADEMICS INSTITUTION TURNED OUT IT WAS THE MOST IM ACCOMPLISH PERSON IN THE FIELD THAT'S ALWAYS COOL UM YES THAT HAPPENED IT BERKELEY THEN THE OTHER THING THAT WE DO IS WE TEND TO PUT YOUDO SIMBL REPARAT SO WE SA PERCEPTION SIMBOL REPRESENTATIONS AND THEN OUR MEMORIES ARE ENTIRELY CONFABULATED BASED ON ALREADY DEFICIENT SIMBOLE AND PERCEPTIONABLE REPRESENTATION YES AND SO I NEVER LIKE THE STATEMENTHAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE BRAIN WORKS I THINK WE DO KNOW HOW THE BRAIN WORKS BUT THAT IT WORKS THROUGH VERY LIMITED FILTERS YESLOOK AS SO KNOWING THAT AND ACCEPTING IT AND UM IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IDEA OF LOOKING TO NATURE LOOKING OUTSIDE US IS SO CRITICAL AND IN FACT I I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND ME SHARING THIS BUT A FEW YEARS BACK I HAD SENT YOU SOMETHING BY TEXT AND I WAS KIND OF IN DISBELIEF ABOUT SOMETHING I'VE SEEN IN THE MEDIA ELS LIKE THEY GOT IT ALL WRONG AND I KNEW THE PERSON INVOLVED AND IT WAS IT WAS NOT A GOOD SITUATION FOR THEM AND ILS IKE THEY GOT IT ALL WRONG AND YOU WROTE BACK AND YOU SAID IT'S ALL LIES BACK TO NATURE THE ONLY TRUTH OW AND WHY AND I WROTE THAT DOWN I PUT IT OVER MY DESK NOW AND I STILL YOU KNOW I'D A TAT TO ITE ON MY FOREHEAD IF I DIDN'T IT I HAV IT WELL WELL COMMITTED TO MEMORY BUT I THINK I KNOW THAT'S TRUE RIGHT NATURE WE CAN LOOK AT AND IT'S BUT WHANT ONE I SAY IT'S ALL WISES YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT OUR BILITY TO HOW LIMITED OUR FACILITY TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE SEE YES YES SO BASED ON MAT THAT LEADS US TO WE CAN'T KNOW MUCH DOYOU NOW'T OW THING OUR RESOLUTION IS SO LOW ON EVERYTHING THAT WE WE REALLY JUST LIKE WERE GRASPING IT STRAWS WE'VE NO IDEA WE HAVE NO IDEA AND THIS GREAT POWER KNOWING THAT BECAUSE IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON CHANCES ARE YOU'RE BEING DECEIVED  NOT BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S DECEIVING YOU BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE TELLING YOU WHAT THEY SEE AND THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S ALL DUNOTIM THING IT'S ALL MADE UP EVERYTHING THAT WE EVERYTHING WE KNOW IS MADE UP MAYBE MAYBE IT'S TRUTH THE SPRINGS US O PA WRESTLING INIT'S IT'S THE REASON THAT PO WRESTLING IS CLOSER TO REALITY THEN ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN WATCH OR ANY OTHER CONTENT IT'S WE KNOW IT'S MADE UP WE KNOW THAT IT'S A PERFORMANCE IT'S STORY TELLING AND THAT'S HOW EVERYTHING IS EXCEPT WE THINK WRESTLING SPAKE IN THE WORLD IS REAL WRESTLINGS REAL AND THE WORLD'S FAKE YOU TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK AF WE'RE DEAFLY GOING AT THIS DIRECTION A IN THE BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT THE OPTHIS NOTION OF ENTERTAINING THE IDEA OF THE OPPOSITE BEING TRUE AS IT AND AND THERE'S OUR NOT ONLY EMERGING BUT ESTABLISHED FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT ARE MAKING GREAT GROUND I THINK INTO THE HUMAN PSYCHE BIRON CATIES WERE AND OTHERS WHERE YOU TAKE A STATEMENT AND YOU START PLAYING WHIT THAT STATEMENT FOR YOU POKE AT IT'S AUTHENTICITY AND WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT I THOUGHT THIS IS KIND OF HOKE WRETE IS JUST WORDS AND THEN I REALIZE HOW FOOLISH I WAS BEING BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY ON TO SOMETHING AND THERE ARE OTHERS TO O COURSE BUT IN SCIENCE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO YOU DON'T REALLY ASK QUESTIONS IN SCIENCE YOU ARE FORCED TO RAISE HYPOTHESES AND TRYING SAY TRUE OR FALSE NOW THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO THAT APPROACH CERTAINLY I MEAN PURE OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES IVE BEEN INCREDIBLE I'M IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'VE REVEAL TO US SPUSHING MEDICINE YOU KNOW PATIENT THAT HAS A BULLET HOLE THROUGH A CERTAINARY OF THE BRAIN YOU DON'T GO IN AND SAY OH I HYPOTHESIZE THAT PERSON WILL HAVE A DEFISITE IN SEEING FACES NOW YOU THE PERSON WANDERED INTO THE CLENEC AND THE GO THIS PERSON CANNOT SEE SEES FACES BUT CAN'T MAKE SENSE OF THEM AND THEN YOU YOU A REVERSE AN YOU YOU FERENSICALLY ARRIVE AT AND UNDERSTANDING SO BUT IN GENERAL WE WE GO ABOUT THINGS IN THIS WAY AND CONSIDERING THAT THE OPPOSIT MIGHT BE TRUE WELL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT I I SUPPOSE OF LIK SEEING THE WAIL AT TE SURFACE OF THE WATER IT'S LIKE WELL THE OPPOSITE OF MY EXPERIENCE WHICH IS ALL ABOVE WATER FOR THE MOST PART IT'S MAYBE NOT THE COMPLETE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE INS OUR SEEING THE INVERSE ALL THE TIME SO I WANTA TO CONSIDER THE UNIVERSE ALL THE TIME AND IT IT REALLYRELATS TO THE WAY YOU YOU DESCRIBED HOW WE SEE COLORS IS BASED ON CONTRAST SO MAYBE BLUES ONLY BLUE IN RELATION TO YELLOW SO IF BLUE IS OUR CHOICE IF WE'RE NOT CONSIDERING YELLOW BLUE DOESN'T EXIST DI NON EM SAYING TO TING WE T ALK ABOUT NIGHT IT'S ONLY NIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S DAY IF THERE WAS NO DAY THERE IS NO NIGHT IN IN ALL OF OUR CASES LIKE IT'S LIKE BEUNIAN YOU KNOWIS LIKE IT'S WE THERE'S THE THE LIGHT AND THE SHADOW ALWAYS THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER SIDE FOR EVERYTHING AND WEV WE FOCUS ON ONE ASPECT BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE OTHER ASPECT CHANCES ARE WE LEARN SOMETHING TO THE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS NOT JUST ABLE TO DO THIS IT'S THE WAY IT DOES EVERYTHING AT TWO EXPERIMENTS AL TOES BRIEFLY DESCRIBE MY SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRANPARENTS GAVE YUILL IN TORRENS OF WEASLL SHOW THAT IF YOU FORCE A PERSON TO LOOK AT SOMETHING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT MOVING THEIR EYES THERE'S A WAY THAT YOU CAN DO THIS THE IMAGE DISAPPEARS BECAUSE NORMALL YOUR EYES ARE MAKING LITTLE MICROSICADS AND YOU'RE COMPARING WHAT YOU'RE SEEING TO WHAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO IT IT'S HE LIKEIC PIC UP IMIC IF WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO USE EXAMPLE OF PRESSING ON THE ARM WERE SITTING IN CHAIRS RIGHT NOW AND UNTIL I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE LEVEL SENSATION ON THE BACKS OF YOUR THOUGHS YOU WERE UNAWARE OF IT BECAUSE IF YOU EXPERIENCE A PRESSURE OR A SMELL IN A ROOM NEVER WALK IN THE SMELL IS EITHER GOOD OR NOT GOOD PRE SOON THE SMELL DISAPPEARS THE NURONS ARE STILL FIRING LIKE SLEDGE HAMMERS ON ON A BELL BUT WE BECOME BLIND AND DEAF TO IT BECAUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM LIKES TO HABITUATE THE VALUE OF THAT SIGNAL WHEN IT'S THERE OFTEN AND IT'S ONLY THE STUFF THAT GOES COMES THROUGH SIGNAL THE NOISE THAT CON AJOLTS US INTO A YOU KNOW ATTENTION AND AWARENESS AND I WANT TO RETURN TO ATTENTION AWARENESS WHICH ARE UM PROMINENT THEMES IN THE BOOK AND I THINK IT IN AN IMPORTANT WAY NOT JUST O ATTENTION O WARENESS IS IMPORTANT BUT YOU ALSO GIVE INSIDT IN TO HOW TO PAY BETTER ATTENTION HOW TO PAY AWARENESS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE RE GOIN TO GO ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY BUT I DO ON'T ASK YOU BOUT WRESTLING BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GROWING U I WAS NOT I LIVE SOUTH OF THE COW PALACE AND THEREWAS SOME WRESTLING GOING ON THERE THING BACK THEN TO HIS W W F THERE WAS A SHORT STIN TO MY CHILDHOOD WHERE I PAID ATTENTION TO IN PARTICULAR UM WAS IT COCO BEWARE THAT GOY THAT HAD O MA CAL I WAS OBSESS WITH TROPICAL BIRDS AND HE WOULD COME IN N PUT THIS TROPICAL VER O THING AND THEN WHO'S THAT GEORGHE ANIMALS STEAL TOGETHER WOULD EAT THE RING OKAY SO UM AND I RELIEF HE WAS A PROFESSOR AES LEON REAL LIFE AMAZEAT USE A PROFESSOR BUT HE LA GEORGI ANIMALS TEAL AS RETH AND I LOVED THE MOVY THE WREST UM A THE WRESTLER RNARNOVSKY  ITAS AM BEMOER TH WONTHEREANS I LIKED AS I ONCE VISITED AM ASBERY PART U IS NOT WHERE THAT WAS FILL NER'S AT THERE'S A VACANT HE WAS O VIS HIS DAUGHTER THERE'S A VACANT A AMUSEMENT PARK OR ABANDON MUSEMENT PARK SEEN THERE THAT WAS REALLY EARY STILL KON AHAUNTS MEAL BUT THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE EAST COAST IN IN CAN A FALL ALL THE PLACES THAT PEOPLE NORMALLY GO FR JUST FOR THE SUMMER HAT WE DON'T HAVE OUT HERE ON THE WEST COAST AM PEEPOE LHE IS COSER UST TOUGHER THAN WHEN WE ARE IT STILL HAUNTS ME UM  GREAT MOVY BUT I REMEMBER WATCHING WRESTLING AND IT WAS AT THAT AGE I THINK IT WAS PROLLY ABOUT TWELVE THIRTEEN MAY BE ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN WHERE UM YOU KNOW YOUR KND OF ENTERING PUBERITY SO AND I  YOU NO PUBRITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL LANDMARK OF OF DEVELOPMENT IT'S THE MOST RAPID PERIOD OF AGING IT'S ALSO WHEN WE START TO CHANGE OUR RULE SET LIKE CERTAIN PEOPLE AND CERTAIN KINDS OF INTERACTIONS TAKE ON PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT MEANING I IT'S NOT JUST A REPRODUCTIVE COMPETENTS TIME AND WHEN KID'S CHAINT THEIR BODIES CHANGE THE RULE BOOK CHANGES FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD CHANGES IN THEM OH YE MEAN THE MOMENT THAT A CHILD UNDERSTANDS REALLY WHAT SEX IS AND CONOHOW THEY GOT THERE AND THAT A LOT OF THIT STUFF THAT WE SEE IN THE WORLD IS IS COND OF PASSIVELY ARE NOT SO PASSIVELY BEING SENT THROUGH THAT FILTER IT'S LIKE IT'S IT'S SOMETHING IT CHANGES THAT THE RULE THE THE RULE BOOK OF'T A PERCEPTION I VIEW THIS AGE FROM ABOUT ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN AT LEAST FOR ME WAS IT UNIQUE TRANSITION POINT WHERE THE GAT BETWEEN WHAT I PERCEIVED AS REALITY IN FICTION WAS KIND OF BLURRY IS IT CAPTURED PRETTY WELL IN THAT MOVI STAND BY ME WHERE THEY'R HANG AROUND THE CAMP FIRE NIGHT IN THE KID SAYS WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT BETWEEN SUPERMAN AND MIGHTY MOUSE AND THE OTHER KID SAYS LIKE YOU IDIOT MINY MOUSE IS A CARTOON OF COURSE SUPERMAN WOULD WIN AND LIK TO ME THAT'S BEING ELEVEN D AND A HALF OR TWELVE YEARS OLD WHERE YOU'RE UNDERSTANDING OF REALITY AS YOU KNOW IT IS CHANGING BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CRYSTALLIZED INTO AN ADULT FOR IN REALITY THAT'S ONI REALLY HEALTHY PLACE TO BE TO ME LIKE THAT NOT LIVING AT CRYSTALLIZE THINK THAT'S THE A THERE'S WHERE THE DOWNFALL HAPPENS SO I HAVE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WRESTLING BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT PROCESS I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER NOT YOU WATCH WRESTLING BECAUSE IT ELOWS YOU TO ACCESS THE ENERGY STATE IN YOUR BODY AND MIND AND THAT KIND OF MODE OF THINKING IN WHICH REALITY AS ONE CONCEIVES IT IS SOMEWHAT BLURRY WHERE IS IT FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS WHICH IS FINE IS THAT THE ENERGY YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPORT AND BRING TO THE CREATIVE PROCESS ELSEWHERE TO LIFE IS IT THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE OR THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ARCHETYPES CAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S COCAL BEWERE OR RANDY MOT TO MEN SAVAGER GEORGETHE ANIMAL STEAL IN THE LOVELY ELIZABETH I GUESS I DID WATCH A LITTLE BIT OF WRESTLING THERE THEY ARE ARCHETYPES MUCH LIKE THE GREEK MITHS OR THE BIBLE OR YOU KNOW I'M NO DISRESPECT TO THE BIBLE OR TO GREEKMITH OR TO WRESTLING FOR THAT MATTER ARCHETYPES ARE ARE POWERFUL FILTER FOR HUMANS BUT WE KNOW THAT THEYARE VERY LIMITED FILTHER TOO BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T BUILT LIKE SQUARE WAVE FUNCTIONS WE HAVE CURVES AND CONTOURS AND COMPLEXITY SO WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO WRESTLING I THINK IT IT MAINTAINS THAT KIND OF PLAYFULNESS ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WE EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED ALL THE TIME AND WRESTLING AND IT'S UM ND IT'S A WAIT TO HAVE A KIND OF A FEELING OF THE ENERGY OF A SPORT WE'VE WITH NO COMPETITION IT'S EVERYONE'S WORKING TOGETHER TO PUT ON THE BEST SHOW THEY CAN SO IT'S MORE LIKE A BALLET THAN IT IS LIKE A SPORTING EVENT AND AND ITE'S GREAT SKILL INVOLVED IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS I CAN WATCH AND REALLY FEEL RELAXED IT RELAXES ME I DON'T FO LOOK AFE TO THINK ABOUT IT I CAN JUST RELAXE AND ENJOY IT THIS BRINGS UP AT A TOPIC THAT IS VERY NEAR NEAR TO MY HEART WHICH IS THIS NOTION OF DOPAMIN SCHEDULES I NEVER WANT TO REDUCE EVERYTHING TO DOPAMIN BUT DOPEMEAN IS THE UNIVERSAL CURRENCY OF DELIGHT PLEASURE MOTIVATION SEEKING THERE ARE OTHER CHEMICALS INVOLVE TO BUT THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENT AND A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT I'LL USE AS A FOUNDATION TO MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WRESTLING AND WY IT'S POWERFUL AND WHY OTHER PEOPLE MAY WANT TO USE WRESTLING OR SOME OTHER AM ENDEAVOR IS A WAY TO ACCESS CREATIVE ENERGY AND SOURCE EALLY ARE WE TALKED ABOUT YEU NOW YOU CAN TRAIN IN ANIMAL TO PRESS UP A LEVER THREE TIMES HEN THEY GET REWARD AND IT WILL LEARN THREE'S THE MAGIC NUMBER FOR REWARD IN THET CAN SWITCH IT TAKES A LIBIT OF TRAINING AND THEN THEY CAN SWITH BUT THEY CAN'T DO PRIME NUMBERS THEY CAN'T DO HIGH ABSTRACTION SCHEDULES HUMANS EITHER WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT FIGURING OUT THE RULE SET FOR OPTIMOL FORAGING WE DO IT WELL ENOUGH TO PERSIST AS A SPECIES AT LEAST FOR NOW BUT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT WE ARE NOT TAPPING IN TO THAT SYSTEM AS WELL AS WE COULD AND HOW WOULD WE KNOW IF WE DON'T KNOW 'S ONE OF US YOU DON'T KNOW H YOU DON'T KNOWS THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENT THAT EXPLORED WHEN DOPAMING IS RELEASED IN THE CONTECTS OF WATCHING SPORT OR WATCHING COMEDY BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND WITH THE COMEDY STUFF IT WAS EVERY TIME THEREWAS A SURPRISE SO AS COMD THAT JARRINGLY HA THEY MEASURE PEOPLE DOPAME PEOPLES TOPENING OUTPUT THEY WEREALSO BRAIN IMAGING IN THE GAME OF BASKET BALL IT'S A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY EXPERIMENTALLY BECAUSE EVERY TIME ONE TEAM GETS THE BALL OR SHOOTING FREETHROWS OR AND THEY'RE GOING DOWN COURT AND IT'S EITHER GAN END UP IN THE BASKET OR IT'S NOT MIGHT END UP ON THE FREE THROUG ALIMEBUTS AND ET WER NOT SO BUT THEY FOUND IS THAT THE SCHEDUL OF ANTICIPATION WAS EVERY TIME THERE WAS A SWITCH OF WHICH TEAM GOT IT SE YOU'RE WAITING WAITING AND THEN IT'S AH NER WAITING WEDDING YES WAITING WAITING THREE POINTER AH OSOM AND IF SOMETHING HAPPEN WHERE LOOK LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE THE THREE POINTER BUT THEN S OMEBODY BASELY SWATTED THE BALL AWAY AND THEN WENT FOR HALF COURT SHOT LIKE YOU DON'T EXPECT THAT VERY OFTEN BIGGER DOPENING RELEASE U GUESS THAT'S NONE HOW THE DOPENING THING WORKS WHEN YOU DESCRIBE WRESTLING I WONDER IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THE SCRIPT IT'S NOT ONE TEAM GETS IT THEN THTHE OTHER TEAM GETS AT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TOWAYIN ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN IS WHAT YOU SAID YES THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT DOPAMIN SURGE OR DRIP WHICH IS A POWERFUL THING IS COMPLETELY IT'S COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR REACH IN INTERMS OF ANTICIPATION YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GON TO COME BUT IT MUST ARRIVE OFTEN ENOUGH THAT YOU RETURN TO IT ELEVEN HOURS E WEK OF WATCHING IN MANY WAYS THE WAY I'M STARTING TO CONCEPTROALIZE THE CREATIVE PROCESS IS A LITTLE BUT THE SAME YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THOSE NUGGETS OF GOLD AND THOSE LOOSE THREADS ARE BUT YOU HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE AND IN THIS CASE I AM REFERRING TO YOU  SPECIFICALLY TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE IN THERE THE PEOPLE WALKING IN THIS ROOM HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ABILITY AND TALENT TO CREATE THAT THE MAP WILL FORM ITSELF AS WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE VOYAGE AND THOSE NUGGETS OF HERE I'M CALLING THEM DOPENMING BUT THEYRE THEY ARE OUT THERE AND THAT KNOWLEDGE IS ENOUGH TO GET YOU TO COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN TO TRUST THE PROCESS SO IISHLYTHINK OF THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE I'M WRESTLING AS YOU KNOW IT'S THE ENERGY OF THE SPORT IT'S NOT THE WHETHER NOT IT'S THIS MOVE OR THAT MOVE OR WHO WINDS OR WHO LOSES IT'S THE ENERGY AND I'M GUESSING IT'S THE ENERGY THAT IT CREATES IN YOU YES IS OBSERVER YES IT'S ENGY CREATES IN ME AND THE REALITY THAT IT'S HONEST IN WHAT IT IS IN A WORLD WHERE SEEMING WE NOTHING IS HONESTED AT WHAT IT IS AND AGAIN TATNMIT NOT NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE YOULYING ALL THE TIME WE HAVE LITTLE DABTA WE MAKE UP THE STORY TO EXPLAIN IT AND THEN WE SAY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AND AND WE HAVE A TRUSTED SOURCES WHO DO EXACTLY WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED AND WHO PAST THIS DOWN AS GOSPEL OF WHAT WHAT WE TEACH AND WE'RE AND MAYBE IT'S TRUE MAYBE IT'S NOT WETH WRESTLING WE KNOW MAYBE IT'S TRUE MAYBE IT'S NOT WE LEAN TOWARDS IT NOT BEING TRUE BUT IT'S REALLY INTRESTING ABOUT RESTLING AVADY ONE MUST FUND THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT SOMETIMES REAL LIFE WORKS ITS WAY INTO THE STORY LIKE A WREST TO WRESTERS GET MARRIED NOW IN REAL LIFE WHELL WE DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE THAT YOU NEVER KNOW IS LIKE IN THE STORY LINE THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED OR GETTING DIVORCED OR BEST FRIENDS TURN ON EACH OTHER AND IT COULD BE PART OF THE STORY ND IT COULD REALLY BE HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY DO RIGHT SOME ONE GETS SOME ONE BREAKS THEIR LEG SO THEY'RE OUT BECAUSE THEY'R LEG IS BROKEN DID THEY BREAK THEIR LEG WE DON'T KNOW THEY'RE OUT DO YOU NOW I'M SAYING THE WE'RE TOLD THEY BROKE THEIR LEG SO THERE'S ALWAYS DISLIKE I WONDER WHAT'S TRUE YOU KNOW WHAT I WONDER WHERE THE LINE IS WE KNOW THAT IT'S SCRIPTED WERE AND WERE PREDETERMINED THAT'S HOW THEY SAY IT'S PREDETERMINED BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE REALITY IS AND ISN'T AND IN SOME WAYS THAT'S OUR REAL EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD IS THIS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE REALITY ISN'T ISN'T WE HAVE AN IDEA MAYBE I THINK IN SOME WAYS WRESTLINGS MORE HONEST OR LEGITIMATE BECAUSE WE START WITH THE IDEA THAT IT'S A THAT IT'S FIXED WEN WE GO TO A BOXING MATH RE NO WHAT A BOXING MATCH THINKING IT'S FIXED YET IT MIGHT BE AND HISTORICALLY IT'S HAPPENED YOU KNOWT OR THERE WAS JA SOMETHING IN BASEBALL WHERE A WAS A BASEMALT I DON'T FOLLOW BASEPALL I SHOULD KNOWN IT WAS JUST THERE WAS JUST THE BIG A SPORTS A OH RONE OF ONE OF THE TEAMS THAT LAYS PASE I YES SAI THAT IS HAT THE CALL SIGNALS OF YES AID THE CATCHER YES YAT THER'S OVER THEY WERE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DEPROGRAMM THE WHERE DE CONSTRUCT THE CALL THE CALL SIGNALS OF THE OTHER TEAMEN I GUESS MAYBE SOME A TEAMDOK CAUGHT DOING THAT YES AND THE TEAM TET ONE WHATEVER THE A YOU KNOW WHERE SERIES WAS IT'S SO IT'S LIKE WE WRESTLING YOU NO THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE A SCANDAL  YOU KNOW OM SAYINGITS LIKE CAUSE THAT ALMOST ANYTHING GOES ANYTHING GOWS AND THAT'S WHAT THE WORLD IS REALLY LIKE SO IN SOME WAYS IT'S COMFORTING AND THERE'S STILL THIS MYSTERY LIKE W I WONDER IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT BECAUSE WE NEVER REALLY KNOW SOME ONE GET'S HURT DID THEY REALLY BREAK THEIR BACK WHERE THEY JUST GOING ON VACATION WE DON'T KNOW WE'LL NEVER KNOW FASCINATING IT IS FASCINATING I FEEL IT THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP IN A WAY THAT IS SURPRISING IN IN NOT JUSTS ONE DIRECTION BUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE IT'S ONE THING FOR A CELEBRITY TO COME OUT AND MAKE A STATEMENT I CAN BE INTERESTING OR NOT INTERESTING DEPENDING ON THE CELEBRITY IN THE STATEMENT AND THE DELIVERY BUT AND I'M PROLY GAN TO GET THIS WRON BECAUSE I'M TERRIBLE AT POP CULTURE THINGS A MOST OF THEM ANYWAY BUT AS I RECALL YOULL LADY GOGA SHOWED UP TO SOME EVENT WEARING IT OUTFIT MADE OF MEAT AND I CAN'T TELL YOU FOR THE LIFE OF ME WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS A STATEMENT AGAINST MEAT OR FOR MEAT TEY DS A STATEMENT FOR THE CARNIVORE DI IT MAY TOS A STATEMENT FOR VEGANISM I DON'T KNOW IN ON MAY OR MAYBE NEITHER OR MAYBE NEITHER BUT IT WAS DEVILLING A STATEMENT IN THAT IT BROKE WITH THE NORM AND IT'S SAID TO ME O K SHE CREATES DIFFERENT RULES FOR HERSELF OR SO BREAKS BOUNDARIES THAT U OTHER PEOPLE A I NEVER HEAD OF ANY ONE DOING THAT BEFORE UM SDOES 'T MEA THEY HADN'T BUT I NEVER HEAD OF ANY ONE DOING IT BEFORE BUT WE DO TEND TO ASSOCIATE AND OUTSIDE THE CURRENT PLAY BOOK WITH COTICO CREATIVITY UNLESS IT CROSSES A LINE IN WHICH CASE IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE IT BECOMES ALMOST FEEDER FOR SAKE OF THEDER BUT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THAT WITHIN THE REALM OF WRESTLING FEEDER IS THE GOAL AT SOME LEVEL AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT WHO GOES INTO THOSE ARENAS WHO WATCHES YES EVERYBODY YES AND EVERYONE AGREES TO KIND OF SO SAND END OUTSIDE REALITY AND SAY THIS IS REALITY YES AND THEY BO FOR THE BAD GUISE AND CHEER FOR THE GOOD GUISE KNOWING THAT BACTS DAYS YOU'RE PROPTLY FRIENDS EXCEPT FOR THE KIDS THAT ARE ELEVEN WHO THINK IT'S REALLY REAL IO NO I DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY KNOW I'M NOT SURE THE ONLY O THE PERSON I  KNOW WHO UM HAS VOCALIZED THEIR LOVE OF A WREST PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING UM TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IS A LARGE FREDERICS IN THE RHYTHMBATAREPLAYER FOR RANCET WHO LOVES WRESTLING BUT HIS STATEMENT AND FORGIVE ME LARS OFON GETTING THIS WRONG UM IS THAT BECAUSE HE GREW UP IN A ARRY OF THE SOUTH BAY WERE LIKE THERE WERE NO TEAMS LIKE NOW THERE'S TA SANDOS AY EARTHQUAKES BUT THERE IS NO FOOTBALL TEAM IN SAINT OSE HE'S FROM CAMPBELL BUT THERE WUL THERE WERE NO LIKE GOOD TEAMS NO SPORTS TEAMS BUT THEY HAD WRESTLING AND HE HAD IT WHERE ON THE TELL OVISION SET AND SO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BUT GUIDIN GREW UP WITH ANY ORGANIZED SPORT THING THE FORTY NINERS WERE UP THE ROAD BUT FOR ME OF ESCAPEWARDING AND I LOVE IT FOR THE SAME REASON YOU ASHIN NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THERE IS NO RULE BOOK THE RULIC IS MADE UP BUT THEY ARE VERY AIT'S A UNIQUE SPORT IN THAT SURFINGS A BIT LIKE THIS TOO IN THAT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY MANIACAL ABOUT MAKING THINGS LOOK A CERTAIN WAY IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST DOING IT IT'S ABOUT DOING IT MAKING IT LOOK GOOD SMOOTH CATCHING IT WITH THE FRONT FOOT THE NEND THAT'S THE TRENS CHANE STYLES IS O IT'S A STYLE STYLE IS IN IT THAT STYLISIS LIKE NEBULOUS THING OF LIKE YOU KNOW IN FASHIONEREINS TAY RIGHT RAS WITH A FOOTBALL THERE SOME AMAZING CATCHES THERE'S EVEN LIKE LA HATCH WHICH I HAPPEN TO KNOW IS A IS A FORTING OR THE CATCH DURING THE SUPERABLEL BUT IN GENERAL IT'S LIKE THE GOAL IS GETTING THE ENDS OWN WHIN THE GAME AND I'M SURE FOOTBALL PLAYERS ARE LIKE CRINGING AS I SAY THIS BUT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU RUN UGLY IF YOU RUN FASTEST IN SCAPE ORING THAT WOULD NEVER FLY IN FACT YOU BASILY BE A RIDICULED OUT OF THE SPORT UM IN WRESTLING IS IT THE SAME ARE THERE IS THERE STYLE TO WRESTLING IT'S ALL IT'S ALL PERFORMANCE IT'S ALL BE CARISMA OF THE PEOPLE IN VOU THIS THE THE PHYSICAL ABILITY THEU BILITY TO TALK AND TELL A STORY AND BE AHOW CARISMATIC THE PERFORMERS ARE WHUT YOU WANT TO WATCH THEM WHIUT YOU WANT TO SEE THEM WIN WHIT YOU WANT TO SEE THEM LOSE AND WITH HE YEAR INTERESTED IN CARBING FOR THEM I WAS YUST SAY IT REMINDS ME OF OPERA BUT OPERA S GET RELEASED OVER AND OVER GAN YOU KNOW THE STORY AND HOW IT ENDS WHEN YOU WALK IN IF YOU'VE LISTENED TO IT BEFORE SO WRESTLING DOES SEEM TO BE UNIQUE IN THAT WAY IT'S REAL TIME ITERATION AT LEAST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE AND AND IT'S REAL TIM ITERATION BASETIME BECAUSE PEOPLE GET HURD ALL THE TIME TO DO REALLY CRAZY PHYSICAL STUFF SO IF SOME ONE GET'S HURT THE STORY HAS'S CHANGE BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE THEY CAN'T SHORT NEXT WEE CAN DO WHAT WAS PLAED IN THE SCRIPT IT'S IT'S VERY ALIVE AND THERE'S A A LOT OF AM SOMETHING INTERESTING AND UNEXPECTED IS ALWAYS HAPPENING BUT IN A MUCH MORE UM I CALM FORM M I I'LL SHARE WITH YOU SOMETHING I JUST LIKE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON IT FOR YEARS I I USED A TOOL IN ORDER TO TRY AN ACCESS IDEAS IM  SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID ACTUALLY IM BECAUSE I HAVE A LI BIT OF OSE DEALO BIT OF A TERET WHEN I GET TIRED I'LL DO THAT LIKE VERY LIKEI'M STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION ORIENTED I HAD THAT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE LITTLE KIT I NEED ALL MY STUFFED ANIMALS ARRANGE IN CERTAIN WAY LEGOAS HOW TO  YOU KNOW OLL NARATI EERE A LO UM AND THEN SCIENCE IS VERY MUCH ABOUT YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS WITH A LOT OF PRECISION AND I DISCOVERED THAT THE ULTIMATE RESET FOR ME WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL OR A POSTTOCK IF I COULDN'T MAKE IT TO A REALLY GOOD LIKE AGNOSTIC FRONT SHOW LIKE CHAOS LIKE THE CHAOS ABUPON CROCKSHOW FOR ME WAS A KIND F THIS RESETS LIKE  COULD LIKE RELEASE ALL THIS THING AND I GOT ENERGY FROM IT FOR SOME I SAW TRANSPLANTS PLAY AND YOU KNOWS LIKE WA CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S CAN TO HAPPEN AND WAS SCARY AND I LOVED IT THE OTHER THING THAT I USED OVER TIME TO KIND OF RESET THIS ABILITY TO TO THINK IN A STRUCTURED WAY WITHOUT IT FEELING LIKE IT WAS OVERCOMING ME MAYBE EVEN ACCESS THE SAME THING IN SOME WAYS THAT YOUR ACCESSING WITH WRESTLING WAS  LIKE TO STRE AT A QUARIA LIKE I LIKE TO GO TO AQUARIUMS OR I'D BUILDIQUARIUMS AND I WOULD JUST SIT THERE BECAUSE OU NEVER KNOW WHICH WAY THE FISHARE GOIN A GO YOU THINK IT'S GOING THAT WAY WITHAN ALL H SUDDENTHEY'LL TURN AND GO THE OTHER WAY IT'S COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE AND I LOVE A QUARIA BECAUSE OF THE TRANQUILLITY AND HAVE THEM IN MY LAB FOR A LONG TIME I JUST A DORE A QUARIUMS BECAUSE OF THE NON LINEARITY OF IT IT'S NOT A B C IT'S A Z Z E CU YOU KNOW AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT SOME PEOPLE TRYIN ACCESS THROUGH PSYCHADELICS BUT THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO ME LIKE A VERY GOOD WAY TO DO IT ON A REGULAR BASIS WHEREAS WITH A QUARIA YOU JUST THE TANKS ARE THERE SO IN YOUR BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I I ALSO SHARE A LOVE FOR WHICH IS IT HOW YOUV THE OCEAN AND ASPECTS OF NATURE LIKE CLOUDS AND OCEAN THEY HAVE A PREDICTABILITY TO THEM WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND WHERE TO FIND THEM UNFORTUNATELY THE S ON RISES AND SETS EVERY DAY AT LEAST FOR NOW AND WE CAN COUNT ON THEM WITH A HUNDRED PER CENT RELIABILITY AND YET THEY ARE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LIKE WHAT PHYSICIS WOULD SAY THEIR VERY CHAOTIC THEY YOU CAN'T LOOK AT A WAVE AND KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE FOAM IS GOIN A ROLL OUT YOU KNOW IT'S GOIN TO ROLL IN AND ROLL OUT WE HAVE THE TIDES BUT WHEN I HEAR ABOUT RESTLING I THINK ABOUT MY LOVE OF A QUARIA I THINK ABOUT MY LOVE OF PUNCROCK MUSIC A FOR INSTANCE FOR I THINK ABOUT THE OCEAN I THINK IN THAT WAY THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEED TO SOURCE FROM THINGS THAT HAVE BOTH A COMMINATION OF STRUCTURE AND NO STRUCTURE I THINKS INTERESTING THAT THERE ARE SOME PLACES THAT DON'T CHANGE IN SOME PLACES THAT CHANGE A LOT AND I CAN REMEMBER THINKING ABOUT THIS I WAS WALKING THIS ON BEACH THAT I WALK ON IN IN WHY THAT I WALK ON EVERY MORNING WHEN I'M THERE AND IF YOU WALK ON THE SAME BEACH EVERYDAY CINDING GET A SENSE OF WHAT IT'S LI CAN REMEMBER I WAS IN WHY WALK ON THE BEACH EVERYDAY FOR YEAR WIRNO WAS AND I LEFT FOR SIX MONTHS AND I CAME BACK AND THE NEXT TIME I WALKED ON THE BEACH IT WAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BEACH ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND AND I REMEMBER THINKING IN THAT MOMENTS LIKE THIS IS AN UNUSUAL PLACE BECAUSE I PICTURED AN THE HOUSE THAT I DIDN'T EVEN GROW UP IN THE HOUSE I WAS I LIVED IN MAYBE FOR THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS IN MY LIFE AND I THINK ABOUT WHITH A BACK YARD LOOK LIFE AND I THINK ABOUT A PARTICULAR OLD TREE THAT WAS THERE AND I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR SHORE BUT MY SENSES IF I WERE TO GO BACK TO WHERE I GREW UP AND GO TO THAT PLACE AND LOOK IN THAT YARD IT WOULD PROBABLY LOOK PRETTY SIMILAR YET HERE WAS THIS BEACH THAT I WAS WALKING ON AN WHY THAT IN THE COURSE OF SIX MONTHS COMPLETELY CHANGE ITS FACE AND JUST HOW INTERESTING BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE AND THAT DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT WORKING ON TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A PLACE THAT WE KNOW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE A LOT AND WHAT THAT WOULD DO TO AR A YOU ARE A CONNECTION WITH THE EARTH WHEN WWHEN WE'RE EXPERIENCING THAT VERSES GO TO GO GOING TO A PLACE THAT HAS VERY LITTLE CHANGE AND YOU CAN KIND OF COUNT ON IT BEING TH WAY IT'S ALWAYS BHEEN THAT BOTH OF THOSE ARE INTERESTING THINGS TO BE ABLE TO DRAW UP ON DEPENDING ON WHAT WE WANT TO OPEN IN OUR IN OUR PSYCHE I HAVE AN ALMOST A UNHEALTHY FASCINATION WITH NEW YORK AND THE MIDATIES AND NINE US AND NOM A IVE YOUNT LIVED THERE THOUGH NO BUT I SINCE I WAS A KIT I WEN THERE WHEN I WAS A LITT KID AND I WAS FASCINATED BY IT THERE'S ALSO A VERY INTERESTING MIGRATION OF EAST COAST TO WEST COAST CREATIVES INCLUDING YOURSELF THAT WAS IT PAI PLAN IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE JUST SEEING THINGS AND HEARING INGS THAT WE'RE MEANING FUL TO ME BUT I LIKE FOR INSTANCE I LOVE THE MOVI I'VEN'T SEEN THE DOCUMENTARY BUT THE ONT ABOUT SHAW MISHELL BOSKIO BOSKIO BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTERS THETARE IN IT AND THE HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THAT LIKE PARKER POSY DENISHOPPER AND CRISFOR WILL AND ON AND ON THAT THOSE IMAGES OF NEW YORK AT THAT TIME ORE SO EXCITING AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING AMH I WISH I COULD TRANSPLANT MYSELF TO THAT BY THE TIME ASHINE THAT'S WHERE I LAND FIRST UM I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW NEW YORK ISNI'T WHAT IT USED TO BE SAFRANCISCO AS NIN WHAN HE USED TO BE WHAT EVER ALLI ISNT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING THAT FEELS A LE BUT DISRUPTIVE TO PEOPLE ABOUT CITIES CHANGING BUT THE IDEA THAT NATURAL LANDSCAPES CHANGE IS ACTUALLY WE'VENEN ACCEPT LIKE A FIRE SWEEP THROUGH PLACES AND ASSUMING THEY WEREN'T STARTED BY HUMANS WE ACCEPT THAT THAT CHANGE AND THE REORDERING OF LANDSCAPES IS NORMAL AND HEALTHY ANI ALWAYS TELL MYSELF THEY HAVE THE KIDS GROWING UP IN NEW YORK OR SAN FRANCISCO OR CHICAGO NOW THEY ONLY KNOW IT THAT WAY SO TO THEM IT'S AS COOLER AS UNCOOL AS IT'S EVER GOING TO BE I THEITHER WANT TO GET OUT OR THEIR LOVING EVERY PIECE OF IT AND THIS HAPPEN FOR ALL THE PEOPLE THIT CAME BEFORE US SO UM MY QUESTIONS A VERY BASIC WHEN DO YOU MISS THE NEW YORK THAT YOU CAME UP IN ARE YOU SOMEBODY WHO IS ATTACHED TO THE PAST IM NON PAST IT ALL I'MOUNT A TO ANYTHING IN THE PAST I DON'T LOOK BACK AT ALL YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT LIKE OH IN MY DORMA MENDAM WHY YOU BEASTY BOY AS THIS LIKE I MIS NOW YOUR YOUR OPTICS ARE FORWARD PRESENT AND FOR ONLY ONLY PRESEN FORARD IS THERE A PROCESS TO THAT OR IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE WHERE YOU DEFAULT TO I DON'T KNO I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THIT'S SO I DO IT NOSTALJAS NOT YOUDT IN RIKRUBEN'S BRAIN NO ULUCKY YOU MAN NO I SAY THAT WITH WITH WITH GENUINE WHAK ADMIRATION UM SO YOU CAN HEAR A SONG THAT MAYBE YOU HAD A AROLLIN PRODUCING OR NOT SOMETHING FROM THE PAST AND YOU'RE ACCESSING A STATE PRESUMABLY BUT YOU'RE NOT PINING FOR WISHING HOW IT WAS NEVER I'M NO PSYCHOLOGIST BUT I'VE MEEN A VENTURE SAY THAT I THINK THAT'S A VERY UNIQUE QUALITY I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WISH FOR OR WISH THAT THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN THE WAY THEY DID THAT THERE'S A LOT OF LIVING IN THE PAST THERE'S A LOT OF THIS NOTION OF LIKE PEOPLE FUTURE TRIP I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S THE DEFAULT STATE OF THE BRAIN I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE IN EMOTIONAL ANCHORS TO THE PAST GOOD AND BAD E AN NON IN WATCHING WRESTLING IS ONE WAY THAT YOU CLEANS THE PALATE ICIYOU CAN YOU GO TO A MEAL AND YOURE HAT THEY PASS AROUND TH  THAT AND THEY DO THE SAM MORE BUT PASS R ONLO BUT ASSORBAY A CLENS THE PALAT TURNS OUT THERE'S A A BIOLOGICAL REASON FOR THAT THERE'S A KIND OF NEUTRALIZATION OF THE TASTE RECEPTORS BETWEEN SAVORY AND SWEET ET CETERA SO WRESTLING IS YOUR A NEW A PALAT NEUTRANELY IF I WATCH US ING BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP IT'S CAN BE GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP DO YOU DREAM ABOUT WRESTLING NOW NEVER SPEMINITES A MINUTES IT'S JUST RELAXING IT'S A IT'S JUST RELAXING DO YOU ANTICIPATE WHEN YOU WATCH IT LIKE HERE COMES THE DOPOMING HET SOMETIMES SOMETIMES WHEN IT HAPPENS NO NOTING TESIDE O WENTER YES SOMETIMES EXCITING  BUT DO YOU ENJOY WILL EVEN MAN IT'S LIKE THE STAKES OR LOW A SI I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT HAPPENS WHICH FEELS GOOD YOU KNOW THAT IM I'M JUST BE ENTERTAINED DO THEY ACTUALLY GET HURT SOMETIMES YOU SAID THEY DO ALA OFTEN DO DO IMEAN THE'R BASICALLY STUNTMAN SO IMAGINE STUNT MAN GETTING HER DOING A CRAZY'S THUN WHAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WHEN THE MOVY THE WRESTLER I REMEMBER HE GOT STAPLE STAPLED INTO HIM AND I THOUGHT THAT'S PRETTY INTENSE I ONCE WENT AND SAW AM I GUESS THEY CALL THAT MEXICAN WRESTLING I DO'TKNOW IF THEY CALL IT THAT ANY MORE WHERE THE EYES GEPS AT AGRATE YET THEY DIPP THEIR HANDS IN GLASS THAS WAS IN SACRAMENTO AND I WENT UN IOSLEY DID NOT A STOMACH FOR IT I REALLY DIDN'T I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS LEGAL IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN LEGAL YET BUT I THOUGHT THIS CRAZY STUFFIN RESTING SOMETIMES  SO IT BEFORE SLEEP IS THAT TYPICALLY WHEN YOU WATCH WRESTLING YES DO YOU THINK IT'S USEFUL FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE SOME ACTIVITY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAND OF IM CLEAR THEIR MIND IN IN A AND CREATE PEACE BEFORE HEADING OFF TO SLEE I THINK SO AND I THINK YOUL CIN MITES WOULD BE GOD LEGS I YOU'LL GAN TO DRIF FOR WRESTLING ANY OF THE N ANY THOSE THAT THINGS YET NOT WATCHING THE DULMERTHING I WON'T WATCH THAT I I AM I DON'T WATCH ANY HORROR ANY ANYTHING OR IDON'T LIKE VIOLENT THINGS NEW I KNOW IT EXIST I KNOW HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE WORLD BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT BEFORE SLEEP I THINK THESE LIMINAL STATES BEFORE AND EMERGING FROM SLEEP ARE VERY POWERFUL IM WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IM ARE YOUR THOUGHTS IMMEDIATELY STRUCTURED OR DO YOU ENJOY THE KIND OF CLEARING OF THE CLOUDS IT'S AS ITS A SLOW PROCESS FOR ME TO WAKE UP AND I LIKE THAT I LIKE NOT ENGAGING TOO MUCH TOO SOON I ALSO AM ANOTHER I USUALLY FALL ASLEEP LISTENING TO A LECTURE OR A SOMETHING SPEAKING AS THAT IF I'M IF I DON'T I CAN GET CAUGHT IN MY OWN THOUGHTS AND LISTENING TO SOMETHING IS ENOUGH OF A FOCUS POINT THAT IT STOPS ME FROM TALKING MYSELF I DO THE SAME MY GRANDFATHER LISTENE TO THE RADIO UT TO IM SPORTS ON THE RADIO AND HE WOULD FALL ASLEEP OFTENTIMES I'S A SMOGER WITH A CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH HIS WIFE'S RESPONSIBILITY WAS TA STAY UP LATER THAN HE SHUREIN FORN EVERYTHING DOWN IM AND THEN WHEN YOU WAKE UP YOU SAID IT'S A SLOW PROCESSES IT AN HOUR OR OR TO BEFORE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR I WOULD SAY PROBABLY AN HOUR I USUALLY WAKE UP AND TRY TO GET IN THE SUN AS SOON AS I POSSIBLY CAN AND HOPE TO SPEND HOPE TO SPEND ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN I'LL USUALLY GO FOR WALK ON THE BEACH IM FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND I BEMINUTES PENDING I ARE YOU WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER PEOPLE THEN I'M USUALLY FOCUSED BY MYSELF FIM I'LL BE LISTENING TO SOMETHING I DON'T LOOK AT THE FUN BUT I LISTEN I LISTEN TO AGAIN LECTURE PON CASTER AUDIABLE I LIKE OGT YOUR BOOKS LOT I DO TO IF AN IDEA COMES TO MIND YOU WRITE IT DOWN I MAY IT DEPENDS I LIKE TO ARE USUALLY A HAVEN'T WOULD DO A NOTE IN MY PHONE I DON'T USUALLY CARRY PIT PANY PEOPLE WOULD ME WHEN IWANT OM WALKING I DO THE SAME I DO A LONG SUNDAY HIKE OR JOG AND I I WILL AUDIOSCRIPT INTO MY PHONE IM PEOPLE SOMETIMES GIVE ME FUNNY LOOKS CAUSE I'M TALKING MYSELF AND I THET'S A NICERWY TO DO THOUGH I'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE OF THE ADO YOUR METHODS OF DOING IT INSTEAD OF A TYPING METHODS MA NOW I TYPE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S BESTWAY THE VOICE MEMOS FUNCTION AND IM I THA I PHONE AND OTHER FHONES IT'S REALLY GOOD AND THEY'RE NOW IUM COMPANYIS LIKE A REVDOCK CALM THAT WILL TURN THOSE INTO WERE DOCSCRIPTS DETTER FAIRLY WELL I'M CRRACTED M FAIRLY INEXPENSIVE KNOW THEIR NOSPONS ARE THE POCAS I JUST HAPPEN S AN IT'S GREAT IM I SHAL LEARN THAT TRICT FROM RICHARD AXEL THE NICKARET CHEWING WILD MAN NO ABLE PRIZE WINTER IM HE WRITES MANUSCRIPTS AND BY WALKING AROUND IS OFFICE PACING AND TALKING INTO HIS FONE I ALWAYS THINK OF THEA WOULD E ALLAN MOVE WERE THE HAV ALLEN ALL THE CHARACTERS WIT YOU KNW Y TALKING ABOUT Y AT PES ES SPEAKING COMEDY IDEAS INTO THE FUNE IT'S REALLY PRETENTIOUS I LIKE THAT MOVY ABOUT HARVEY MILK THAT CHANPANPLAYE HARVEY MILK IAUSE I'LL TOOK PLACE BEFORE I WAS ALIVE MOSTLY IN THE BEYTERY BUT THERE'S THIS THESE BEAUTIFUL SCEMES OF HIM AS I RECALL SITTING THERE AT IS KITCHEN TABLE TALKING INTO A TAPER QUARTER AT NIGHT TELLING BOUT HOW HE PREDICTED THAT HE WOULD BE POSSIBLY ASSASSINING  ET CETERA AND THIS GOES ABACK TO THE STROMER THING ABOUT WRITING THINGS DOWN I REM YOU KNOW I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE EGOTISTICAL GILT AROUND LIKE WHO AM I TO THINK THAT MY IDEAS COULD BE WORTH WHILE OR SOMETHING BUT IM YOU KNOW IT I THINK OVER TIME I'VE COME REALIZED THAT THE IDEAS ABOUT EXPERIMENTS OR HEALTH QUESTIONS I HAVE ABOUT HEALTH WERE THE IUM THEY THEY DON'T ALWAYS BUT OFTENTIMES CAN LEAD TO REAL YOU KNOW SEEDS THAT GROWING TO BUT ITS SROMSING THAT'S INTERESTING TO YOU IT'S IT'S IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ANY ONE ELSE THINKS YOU KNOW LIKE A MOST OF MY NOTES ARE NOT FOR ANY ONE ELSE IS  YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE ELSE AS USE LIKE I I HERE ABOUT SOMETHING IT'S INTERESTING TO ME AND I THINK ABOU DON'T A WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS WHATEVER IT IS AND MEN SOMETIMES THOSE THINGS WORK THEIR WAY INTO THINGS I'M DOING BECAUSE H UNIVERSE SEEMS TO WORK IN THAT WAY BUT I REALLY AT LEARNING SOMETHING WITH THE IDEA OF USING IT I LEARNED THINGS WITH THE IDEA OF THIS IS WHAT I WANTED NOW THIS IS WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME AND THEND OFTEN THOSE THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING TO ME CAN FIND THEIR WAY INTO OTHER PROJECTS JUST BECAUSE THEY DO YET IT'S ALMOST LIKE COAL OR KINDLING BUT THE MOMENT THAT YOU THINK OF IT THAT WAY IT IT'S FOR IT SOUNDS SO EXTRACTIVE RIGHT BY  IF SO YOU YOU TAKE THIS WALK IND YOUR IN YOUR I'M WRITING DOWN THE OCCASIONAL IDEA PERHAPS AND THEN I'M WHAT IS THE NEXT SORT OF THE WAY THAT I'M HERE A LESS THAN DO THIS THAN THIS THAN THAT IA'M INTERESTED IN I WHERE DOES YOUR MIND SHIFTY DOES IT BECOME MORE STRUCTURED AS THE DAY GOES ON DOES YOU'RE THINKING BECOME AM MORE STRUCTURE AROUND PROJECTS IN THE CLAN A TRI DO IM DEAL WITH THINGS THAT ME DEALING WITH AFTER THAT AND IN PREPARATION FOR GOING TO WORK AND THE WHEN I GO TO WORK IT'S MORE LIKE FREE THIS FREETHING WERE'M AGAIN HOPING SOMETHING GOOD COMES A WELCOMING SOMETHING GOOD PAYING ATTENTION AND I MAY BE TRYING TO WILL IT TO HAPPEN BUT NEVER A BUT KNOWING I I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN I CAN JUST BE PRESENT FOR IT AND BE READY IF IT DOES ARRIVE SOME OF THIT I'M MORE SURPRISING AND I I FOUND RELY A INTERESTING AND USEFUL FEATURES OF THE BOOK WHEREABOUT I'M TO DANCING WITH STRUCTURE AND LACK OF STRUCTURE SO WHEN I THINK OF STRUCTURI THING LIKE DEAD LINES SO WHEN YOU ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING SOMETHING I'M IVESEE DEAD LINES ARE RELEVANT TIME OF DAY I THERE'S ONLY SO MANY HOURS IN THE DAY WHERE ONE CAN STAY IN THE GROOVE OR THIS  LIKE READINESS TO RECEIVE IM HAVE YOU EVER FOUND YOURSELF IN THAT MODE WHERE YOU'RE CONTO GRINDING LIKE ALL LIKE HERE WE ARE LIKE OKE AV NOT COMING HOME FOR DINNER AND IGHT IT'S THE NEXT YOT WORK IN A PUSH WELL I NOT THAT PUT ALL THE COFF UPOT KIND OF THING A LOT A LOT IN THE OVER THE COURSE OF MY LIFE A LIVE NOT IS MUCH NOW I'M AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DISCOVERED THROUGH WORKING ON THE BOOK WAS THE PHASES OF WORK WHERE NOT REQUIRED TO TREAT THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF WORK IN THE SAME WAY WRS BEFORE I DID BEFORE EVERYTHING WAS IN MISSTATE OF PLAY EVERYTHING HAD AND A WHIDE OPEN TIMES STEDUAL IT HAPPENS WHEN IT HAPPENS AND IF IT TAKES TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT'S NOT ABOUT THAT IT'S ONLY ABOUT THIS THING AS BE GREAT AND WHAT I CAME TO REALIZE IN WORKING ON THE BOOK IS AT THEIR THEIRE DIFFERENT PHASES AND THE FIRST PHASE IS THIS SEED COLLECTING PHASE WHICH IS KIND OF AN ONGOING PART OF LIFE IN GENERAL I DO THAT I DO THAT ALWAYS WHITHER I'VWHE THEREARE WORKING ON SOMETHING OR NOT I'M ALWAYS IN THE SEED COLLECTING PHASE AND THERE'S NO DEAD LINE OR A ITJUST ANYTHING THAT INTERESTS ME THAT I THINK I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OR HAS POTENTIAL TO BE SOMETHING ANYTHING SOMETHING I HEARE SOMETHING THINKING ID LIKE TO READ MORE ABOUT THAT OR I WONDER IF I WONDER IF THERE'S A MOVING ABOUT THAT IS THE REMOVING ABOUT THAT IF NOT MAYBE THERE'S A MOVOU TO BE MADE YOU KNOW I COULD AGAIN I WANT THIS SOMETHING I WANT IN MY LIFE LET'S SEE IF IT EXIST IF IT DOESN'T EXIST THEN MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING INTERESTING TO PURSUE BUT I KNOW THAT THE DESIRES THERE CAUSE I HAVE IT OF SO N THE SEED PHASE THERE'S NO DEAD LINES IS JUST A WIDE OPEN PART AND THEN THE NEXT PHASE IS CALLED EXPERIMENTATION PHASE WER YOU WE START EXPERIMENTING TO SEE WHAT THE SEEDS WANT TO DO YOU'RE INVOLVED BUT YOU'RE MORE O A A YOU'RE NOT REALLY DICTATING THE ACTION YOU'RE YOU'RE SETTING THE STAGE FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU YET SO IT BE LIKE THE EQUIVALENT OF YOU'D PLANT THE SEED YOU'D WATER IT YOU'D MAKE SURE IT WAS IN THE SUN AND YOU'D WAIT I'M SO YOU'RE INVOLVED BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT GROW YOU KNOW AND THEN WHEN IT'S SPROUTS AND IT GROWS AND O IF IT TURNS INTO A PLANT THAND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE PLANTS I O CAY HAD IS THIS PLANT WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL OF THIS PLANT AND THEN Y AND THAN THAT THE THIRD PHASEIS THE CRAFTING PHASE OR IS LIKE CO HAVE THIS PLANT MAYBE HIM IN THE TRIM IT OR MAYBE I'M THAN A DA COMBINE IT WITH THESE OTHER PLANTS TO MAKE SOME SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT ANOLSE LIKE MATERIAL THAT YOU HAVE AND THEN FINALLY IS THE THE COMPLETION OR OR FINISHING PHASE WHICH IS THE FINAL LET IT GET GETTING TO THEVERSION OF IT THAT THE VERSION OF IT THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU CALDN'T SHARE WITH THE WORLD IF IF THAT' SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT BY THE TIME YOU'RE GOING INTO THE COMPLETION PHASE YOU CAN HAVE A DEAD LINE AND IT WON'T HURT THE PROJECT IN FACT IT MIGHT HELP THE PROJECT AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BEFORE SO I'VE WORKED ON PROJECTS THAT HAVE GONE LONGER THAN THEY NECESSARILY NEEDED TO AND MAYBE NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE TIMING O THAT BECAUSE I BECAUSE I A'M SO AWARE OF THE NECESSITY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL PHASE DID NOT HAVE A DEAD LINE THAT I ASSUME THAT THAT HELD THROUGH THE WHOLE PROJECT AND AND THEY'RE IT'S NOT A CLEAR PHASE ONE FINISHES AND THEN YOU START FACE TWO FACE TO FINISHES AND YOU START FACE THREE YOU MOVE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM I'M COLLECTING SEEDS ALL THE TIME I'M ALWAYS IN PHASE ONE AND THEND PROBABLY TO SOME DEGREE THERE'S ALWAYS SOME VERSION OF EXPERIMENTATION GOING ON MAYBE NOT NOW BUT IF SOMETHING'S ON A LIST OF THINGS I WONE TO LOOK AT HOPEFULLY I'LL GET GET TO THE LIST AND GIVE THEM SOME EXPERIMENTATION AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN TURN INTO AND THEN IF THEY DO TURN INTO SOMETHING THAN THEY GET TO THE CRAFTING PHASE WORT'S MORE OCAY NOW I HAVE THIS THING WHAT WHATO I KNOW ABOUT THIS KIND OF THING WHAT CAN I MATCH THIS WITH WHAT CAN I USE THIS FOR HOW CAN I BE INVOLVED AS A CRAFTSMAN AND BY THE END OF THE CRAFTING PHASE OR DEEP INTO THE CRAFTING PHASE YOU CAN START SEEING THE END YOU NEEY CAN START SEEING AN END AND THEN YOU CAN EVEN DICTATE AN END BUT I RECOMMEND IF YOU DO JUST DICTATE IT FOR YOU NOT FOR ANY ONE ELSE BECAUSE IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE YOU LEARN IF YOU A SET A DEADLINE PUBLIC DEADLINE AND THEN A NEW DISCOVERY HAPPENS ALONG THE WAY ANDYOU MUS ALTIYS CONNECTION BE MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT BUT I NEED MORE TIME IT'S HARDER TO DO THAT IF YOU SET THE DEAD LINE SIOULD SAY HAVING INTERNAL DEADLINE TO GET TO FINISH IT THAT SAID IF AN UNUSUAL SITUATION COMES UP AND IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYTHING NOT TO MEET THAT DEADLINE IT'S A IT'S ONE OF THOSE RULES THAT YOU SET THE RULE TO BREAK IT IF IT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PROJECT A BUT THAT THAT WAS A DEW THING FOR ME AND AN IT HELP ME A LOT WHEN DID YOU REALIZE THT IN COLLECTING THE MATERIAL FOR THE BOOK AND FINKING ABOUT IT WHEN WHEN I REALIZED THAT IT WAS PHASES I DIDN'T I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS WHEN WHEN I START RITING THE BOOK I DIDN'T KNOW ANY HARDLY ANY OF THE THINGS IN THE BOOK THEY'RE MORE AN MOST OF IT WOULD BE REVERSE ENGINEERING SOME THING THAT I HAD EXPERIENCE A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE A USING THESE METHODS WITHOUT KNOWING THERE WERE METHODS JUST FOLLOWING MY INSTINCTS GOT ME TO SOMETHING GOOD AND THEN I WOULD LOOK BACK AT WHY DID I WANT TO DO THAT AND IS THERE A A PRINCIPLE AT PLAY THAT CAN BE OF USE OUTSIDE OF THIS CASE AND HOW DORIGT EXPLAIN THAT AND T  THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK IS AS THESE REVERSE ENGINEERED PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE LED TO A GOOD DECISION MAKING IN TRYING TO MAKE THINGS THE CHAPTER ON SELF DOUBT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME AS WER ALL TELL ME WHAT IT SAYS RWELL YOU I'LL READ THE FIRST SENTENCE OUT ON BECAUS ITSELF DOOUTLIVES IN ALL OF US AN WHILE WE MAY WISH IT WAS GONE IT IS THERE TO SERVE US AND IT GOES ON TO IT STRIBE HOW TO IM DANCE WITH SELF DOUBT UM IN NOT SO MANY WORDS I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A SAYING THAT UM IS ACTUALLY FROM THE LANDSCAPE OF PSYCHOLOGY UM WHICH IT WHICH IS A  GENERALLY DISCUSSED IN A UM IN A KIND OF PATHOLOGICAL CONTECT WHICH IS UM IF NOTHING MATTERS ANYTHING GOES THIS IS USUALLY THE PHRASE USE TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE WHO FEEL AS IF LIKE THERE'S NO YOUS IN LIVING SUCH AS GO CRAZY OFTEN TO SELF DESTRUCT BUT THERE'S A LIGHT VERSION OF THIS I REALIZE WHERE IN SOME SENSE THET CREATIVE PROCESS SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT OUTCOMES ARE MY WHO LIKES IT WHO DOESN'T LIKE IT AND YOU'RE JUST DOING IT FOR YOU YOU MAKE THE THE RULE PLAY I WANTA DELIGHT MYSELF WELL THEN ANYTHING GOES AND YOU HAVE AN INFINITE RULE SET THERETTO EXTRACT FROM AT LEAST INITIALLY SO AS ONE GETS BETTER AT THEIR CRAFT YOU CAN IMAGINE SELF DOUBT GOES DOWN I THINK THAT'S THE PERCEPTION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE RIGT YOU GET BETTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU KNOW YOU CAN A LANDMORE THREE FREE THROWS AS A BASKETBALL PLAYER YOU CAN HIP MORE HOME RUNS AS A BASEBALL PLAYER COBRIS MORE YOU KNOW UM PLATINO MAUBUMS AS AS AN ARTIST YOU YOU KNOW SELF CONFIDENCE GOES UP SELF DOUBT GOES DOWN BUT THANK YOU AND I BOTH KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES THERE'S A MERROR IMAGE TO THAT WHERE PEOPLE FEEL PRESSURE BECAUSE THEY DID AT ONCE NOW THEY GOT TO DO IT AGAIN YES OR THAT YOU THINK YOU'RE SO GOOD AT IT IT ET COMES EASILY ANION HAVE TO APPLY YOURSELF ARROGANCE YET SO SELF DOUBT IS IT'S LIKELY HAV IT'S A CHECK ON YOURSELF IT CAN EITHER BE REALLY HELPFUL OR IT CAN UNDERMYT YOU SO IT'S SOMETHING WE ALL HAVE AND IF WE LET IT UNDER MY NUSS AND WE DON'T MAKE ANYTHING THAT'S NOT TOD UM BUT WHEN USED AS A A BALANCING TOOL IN OUR LIVES IT SERVES A GREAT FUNCTION WHERE WE REALLY DO IT'S O KAY TO HAVE ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD AND STILL SECOND GUESS IS THIS THE BEST IT CAN BE YOU CAN DOUBT I THINK THET THE PHRASES IN HA BOOK YOU CAN DOUBT YOUR WAY TO A GREAT WORK YOU KNOW TO MASTERPIECE UM SOMETIMES THAT QUESTIONING ALLOWS YOU TO PUSH FURTHER EEN JUST EXCEPTING I MADE IT SO IT'S GOOD YE I'VE ENCOUNTERED MORE PEOPLE THAT SEEM TO BE DRIVEN BY UM SELF DOUBT AND THE NEED TO CONSTANTLY PERFORM AND PERFORM AGAIN THAN I HAVE REAL ARROGANCE JUST HAS BEEN MY EXPERI TS FORTUNATELY I' THAT'S AMERIGAN PEOPLE IN MY LIFE BUT UM AND OF COURSE WE NEVER AS A PSYCHIATRIST A WHO I ADMIRE A LOT AND BY O ENGINEER WHO WAS A GUEST ON THIS POCK AS CALLED DICEROT SAID YOU KNOW WE WE NEVER REALLY KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL IT ME MOST THE TIME WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW WE FEEL AGAIN LANGUAGE IS A VERY DEPRIVED FORM AT FOR EXPLAINING FEELING SO WE THINK SOMEBODY FEELS ONE WAY BUT WE CAN OBSERVE AN IT COULD BE ANOTHER BUT WE OBSERVE THEIR BEHAVIOR SO IN THE SENSE OF RETURNING TO THE WORK YOU KNOW JUST ALWAYS RETURNING TO PROCESS SONE LIKE YOUR ROUTINE IS FAIRLY SCRIPTED AT LEAST NOW UM BUT THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE GETTING IN TOUCHWITH RESTLING SLEEP AND DREAMING UM THE OCEAN THERE'S A PREDICTABILITY OF THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN ACCESS THEM IN A PREDICTABLE WAY BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF UNPREDICTABILITY IN THEM THE OCEAN IS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE I ALSO LISTEN TO A LOT OF MUSIC THAT I DON'T KNOW SO LISTEN TO A LOT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC AN AH LES SO BUT SOM JAS AND A LOT OF OLD MUSIC THAT I NEVER HEARD BEFORE AND I LIKE I LIKE BEING SURPRISED BY MUSIC UM AND SOMETIMES IT REALLY CATTURES ME OFF GARD LIKE I MICIOUS AMALAT YOU KNOW IN WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING I LIKE AT THE EVER ENCOUNTER MUSIC THAT REALLY WORKS WELL LIVE BUT JUST DOES NOT WORK IN A RECORDING OR THAT IS THAT MUCH BETTER LIVE BUT THE RECORDING A SORT OF MAT YOU'RE OFTO NAME MA I DON'T THINK SO IF YOU LIKE MAYBE THER SOME ARTISTS WHO A GREAT LIVE WHO'VE NEVER CAPTURED IT WELL ON RECORD EXAMPLE WOULD PROBABLY BE THE GRATEFUL DIDS GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BANDEREI FYE LIKE THEIR ALBLUMS ARE NOT THEIR STRONG POINT BUT THE YOU EAR LIVE RECORDINGS THEY REALLY INTERESTING REALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER AND THAT'S KIND OF PART OF WHAT MAKES THE GRATEFUL THAYT INTERESTING IS THERE UNPREDICTABILITY I CONFESS I  SISTER WHO LISTENED THE GRATEFUL DEAD AND IE GOT TAKEN TO A FEW SHOWS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND THEY WOULD DO THAT AS A CALLED SPACE SOAS LIKE THESE DRUM SOLOS THAT WOULD GO ON FOR HOURS AND OURS IS LIKELHY UNTITHESIS OF PONHATIR S RESOLSA LIKE NINETY TO HUNDER AND TWINTY SECONDSTAN I YET AND I REMEMBER THING LIKE WHAT IS THIS WHAT IS THIS BUT PEOPLE I KNOW LOVE THE GRATEFUL DED LOVE THAT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WERE THAT THAT DRUM THING I THINK THEY DO CALL IT SPACE FORGIVE ME DEAD HEADS I'M NOT ENOUGH OF ONE TO I GET IT RIGHT U BUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES THEY FIND IT AND IF YOU'RE DHEARE WE MAY FIND IT WE FEELS EXCITING ITIS NOT JUST A IT'S NOT JUST FOLLOWING A SCRIPT IT'S LIKE SOMETHING IS REALLY HAPPENINGS IT'S A REAL MOMENT SA SOMETHING THAT I I AIM FOR IN STUDIO IS TO CREATE REAL MOMENTS THAT WHEN YOU HEAR THEM THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SOUND PERFECT THEY SOUND LIKE SOMETHING THAT REALLY HAPPENED AND IN THAT MOMENT SOMETHING HAPPENED AND IT'S A SPECIAL MOMENT AND YOU YOU CAN FEEL THAT IF THEY WERE TO PLAYED AGAIN IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT THER'S SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING ABOUT THAT THIT'S IT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S HOW JAS JASWORKS AS WELL AND I'M I THINK SOME OF BRINGING SOME OF THAT JASMENTALITY INTO OTHER TYPES OF MUSIC IS IS REALLY INTERESTING MAKES FOR COMPELLING THINGS CAUSE WHEN YOU HEAR THEM IRE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT O AM YOU YOU YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO DO IT WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT YOU'RE REALLY PAYING ATTENTIONS I I DON'T REALLY KNOW THERE'S NO MUSIC THERE'S NO IN OTHERE'S NO A THERE'S NO MAP TO FOLLOW AND NOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SOMETHING DO I PLAY OR NOT PLAY WHEN DO I PLAY AND YOUR REALLY PAYING ATTENTION AND CAN I ADT OR YOU GO TO START ADDING SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE AT AT SOMETHIN THAGOI CAN'T DO THAT AND S EVERYONE'S JUST IN THIS THING IN THIS MOMENT EXPERIENCING THIS THING AT ONCE THAT YOU CAN FEEL AS A LISTENER AND WE GET TO WE GET TO HEAR THEIR EXCITEMENT OF FINDING IT AND IT'S THRILLING WHEN IT HAPPENS SO I II LIKE THAT EXPERIENCE I FEELIN THAT'S KIND WHANT THE DEAD DO LIVE THE PLAY SONGS IN DIFFERENT WAYS UMAND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE DEAD AND A SORT OF A NEWER AIT'S NEWER FOR ME TO LISTEN TO THE DEAD GROWING UP I NEVER LISTEN OF THE DEAD BUT PROBABLY BECAUSE I HEARD SONGS ON THEIR ABUMS AND THOUGHT DISIT US WHENLY SPEAK TO ME BUT I THINK THAT THE ATOMS DON'T REALLY REFLECT WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THEM I THINK A LATHER SHOWS ARE RECORDED RITER O VEITAPE YES IRS BUT BY BY FANDS WHICH THEY I'M SUPPORTED THEY SUPPORTED THAT EVERYBODY COME EVERYBODY TAKE EVERYBODY  YOU KNOW TRADE TAPES IT MADE SENSE FOR WHO THAT MAN WAS THEY READ TEFIND OR THEY DEFIND SKEEMSE ME THE NOTION OF FOLLOWERS AND MAY PEOPLE LITERALLY GAVE UP THEIR LIVES OR SPENT MUCH OF THEIR LIVES I LITERALLY DRIVING FROM CITY A CITY TO FOLLOW THEM BUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY GOING FROM CITY TO CITY TO WATCH A MOVY OVER AN OER FOR THI'S NOT A MOVY IT'S DIFFERENT EVERY NIGHT IT'S CHANGING PREY INCREDIBLE PHENOMENON USAY I DON'T NOW OF ANYTHING ELSE QUITE LIKE IT EXCEPT CULTS AND THEN THOSE OFTEN DON'T END WELL I THINK I GUY THAT I MIXE THE PUNCH AT THAT FOR THE JELLANTS TOWN MASKER WENT TO MY HIGH SCHOOL THAT WAS THE S THAT TRUE I THAINK SELYISAND MY SISTERS REALLY GOT AT ALL THIS KIND OF LIKE EVENTY'S EIGHTY IT IS LIKE UM LIKE DARK PSYCHOLOGY TRIVIA SHE'S VERY LIKE PERSON BUT DREDA SEASOMOF WHICH NO IT'S ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO I SIXTHES AS GREAT BELOW IT ONE AY A BOOK OUGT TO CHECK IT OUT THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE A EXPERIENCES GOING BY AND TIME AND OR OR THINGS EMERGING IN TIME AND THE CREATIVE PROCESS BEING A WAY OF OBSERVE GRABIT CATCHING CAPTURING THOSE MOMENTS MAYBE RE RRANGE WE MAYBE WATERING ET CETERA UM I THOUGHT WAS BEAUTIFULLY CAPTURED IN THE IN THE ANALOGY YOU GAVE ABOUT A KIND OF A COMB A CONVEYOR BELT GOING BY OF THINGS RIGHT THAT WE THING OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS LIKE IT'S IN A LAND IN US OR WE'RE GIN TO ENTER IT ORE THAT WE'REGIN TO SIT THEREIN A CHAIR IN LEK GRID OUR TEETH THE OTHERE'S LIKE A SOMEHEMMING WAY QUOTE ON WERE YOU JUST SIT THERE IN STAIRE AT THE PAGE UNTIL THE BEADS OF BLOOD FORM ON YOUR FOREHEAD OR SOMETHING MAYBE YOU WAS HIM MAYBE AS  SOMELING COWSKER SALLING ANYWAY INLLY GET THIS WRONG PEOPLE TELL ME IN THE COMMENTS UM MAYBE NO ONE SAID IT IT WAS A DRANG BUT I LOVE THIS CONVEYOR BELT THAY TE THAT REMINDS ME OF BEING IN LABORATORY DOING EXPERIMENTS THINKING I MUS TRYING TO SOLVE ONE THING AND THEN SEEING SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN HAVING TO MAKE THE DECISION LIKE IS THAT REALLY COOL ENOUGH TO DROP EVERYTHING AND GO THAT DIRECTION OR TO KIND OF SPEND A NIGHT OR A WEEK OR A CAREER GOING THAT WAY AN ME TESE ER CONT OF BIG DECISIONS GIVEN THAT AT LEAST AS FAR AS WE KNOW WE'RE WE'REGONG TO LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS OR LESS AN BUT THIS IDEA THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW THOUGHTS AND EXPERIENCES IN OUR PAST AND WE CAN DR DRAWN AND LIKE TRY TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS TO BE TO BE LIKE GRABLING THINGS OFF THE CONVEYOR OR NOT I HEARING YOU IN IM S TRYING TO REALIZE THAT BEING ATTACHED TO THE PAST MIGHT BE THE WORST THING THAT ONE COULD DO IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS IN THIS CONTEXT BECAUSE IT WE HAVE A KIND OF A PLAY BOOK OF WHAT'S WORKED AN WHAT HASN'T WORK BUT YOU EXSHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS THERE'S A A PASSAGE IN THE BOOK YOU KNOW THAT IM I'LL JUST READ IT IM TO BE BEWARE OF THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE WAY YOU WORK IS THE BEST WAY SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S THE WAY YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE I SAT WITH THIS PAGE FOR ALMOST TEN FULL MINUTES WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING I DO VERY OFTEN MAY YOU COULD ELABORATE ON THE SOL BET I MEAN WE WANT TO HAVE YOU KNOW MECHANISMS AND ROUTINES WE CAN TRUST BUT THIS IS A I THINK AN IMPORTANT WARNING WHEN WHEN SOMETHING WORKS IT'S EASY TO BE FOOL INTO BELIEVING THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT OR THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY IT'S JUST A WAY AND IT'S JUST A WAY THAT HAPPENED TO WORK THAT TIME AND THIS PLEASING TO WEN YOU GET AH ADVICE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU YOU'D  EXPLAIN YOUR SITUATION THEY TELL YOU THEIR ADVICE THE ADVICE THAT THEY'RE GIVING YOU IS NOT BASE ON YOUR LIFE FOR YOUR EXPERIENCE AS SPACED ON THEIR LIFE IN THEIR EXPERIENCE AND THE STORIES THAT THEI'R TELLING ARE BASED ON EXPERIENCES THEY'VE HAD THETER THAT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT DAT OF POINTS THAN YOURS SO MAYBE THEY'RE GIVING YOU GOOD ADVICE BUT MAYBE THEY'RE GIVING YO GOOD ADVICE FOR THEM AND NOT GIVING YOU GOOD ADVICE FOR YOU AND IT'S IT'S EASY WHEN WE TRY SOMETHING AND HAVE A RESULT POSITIVE RESULT THINKING THIS IS IT EVERYBODY CAN DO THIS YOU KNOW THE WAY I II WAS VIGAN FOR LONG TIME TWENTY YEARS AND THEN I STARTED EATING THEM I STARTIEDING ANIMAL PROTENE AND THEN EVENTUALLY CHANGED MY CHANGE MY DIED A FEW TIMES TO THE POINT WHERE LOST LOT OF WEIGHT THE WE THAT I DID IT WORK FOR ME BE RIGHT BEFORE THAT HAPPENED I DID A SOMETHING THAT I WAS TOLD THAT EVERYONE ELSE WHO DID WHAT YOU DID THEY ALL LOST WAIT FOR WHATEVE REASON I DIDN'T SO THE IDEA THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT FOR SOME ONE ELSE I THINK IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OURSELVES AND IF WE DO SOMEHOW CRACK THE CODE OF WHAT'S RIGHT FOR US BE HAPPY WE HAVE IT AND THEN STILL KNOW I WONDER IF THAT'S THE ONLY WAY MAYBEIS AN EVEN BETTER WAY THAT WE'RE NOT CONSIDERING YOU KNOW LIKE AN A NOT TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH THINKING WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS JUST BECAUSE WE GET THE OUTCOME WE WANT I WAS RAISED IN SCIENCE WITH A PRINCIPLE IT WAS LITERALLY DICTATE TO ME AS A PRINCIPAL ALMOST LIKE A RULE OR RELIGION WHICH WAS THAT THE BRAIN IS PLASTIC IT CAN CHANGE AND LEARN UNTIL YOU'RE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE AND THAN THE CRITICAL PERIOD'S END IN THAT'S IT AND THIS WAS A RULE IS SEMTITE WAS DICTATED A NOBLE PRIZE WHICH WAS VERY DESERVED GIVEN TO MY SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRAND PARENTS THEY DESERVE IT UN BUT I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO CHANGING OF BRAIN STRUCTURE FUNCTION IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY AFTER AGE TWENTY FIVE OR SO TURNS OUT THAT'S COMPLETELY WRONG SORRY DAVID AND TOWARDS THEM BUT THEY KNEW IT WAS WRONG WOL BETY INTERESTING YET I WAS ACTIVELY SUPPRESSED BECAUSE THERE'S A COMPETITIVE NATURE OF PRIZES AND DISCOVERIES AT THAT TIME AND A GUY TEME MIKE MERSONIC AND HIS STUDENT ON GREY RECKONS ON WERE SHOWING TT A DULL PLASTICITY EXISTS AND ONLY NOW AS THIS REALLY STRYING TO EMERGE AS A THEME I JUST CRAZY LIKE THERE WERE SO MANY REASONS AND THE TAXTBOOKS SAID IT WE WERE ALL TOLD IT AND IT CHANGED OUR BEHAVIOR NOW WE KNOW THIS TO BE COMPLETELY FALSERS PLASTO SEE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPEN THERE'S LIMITS TO IT HERE AND THERE BUT LIKE IT'S JUST FAR AND AWAY A DIFFERENT STORY SO WHY WOULD THAT BE THE ONELY TIME MATEVER  EXACTLY AND AND A BUT THE FIELD WAS RUN BY A VERY SMALL CABAL OF PEOPLE THAT ALL FIELD SA RUND BY VERSE IN AL CABALITY OWHO HAVAN INVESTMENT IN THINGS BEING T WAY THEY ARE NOW BECAUS THERE IN CHARE AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT GETTING OLDER IS THAT UM WELL FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE EVENTUALLY AGES AND I I HOPE THAT YOU KOW A DAVID UNFORTUNATE PASSED AWAY HE WAS LOVELY TORNSON'S LEVELY HES STILL ALIVE AND THEY WOULD SAY I THINK TWARDSTON WOULD SAY YH WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE OPEN OR KIND IN IN ALLOWING THESE OTHER IDEAS BUT I THINK THAT BUT JUST THINK ABOUT ALL THE YEARS AT E WASTED WI THIS MISUNDERSTANDING ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND AND IT WEN BEYOND THAT AND THERE WOULD BE B S SPECIALS THAT HELP PROPAGATE THE SENOR ONE OF THE GOLS OF THE PODCAST HAS BEEN TO TRYAND SHED SHINE LIGHT ON IDEAS THAT AT FIRST SEEMED CRAZY LIKE I KNOW YOU AND I ARE BOTH A SEMI ABSESSED WITH THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF LIGHT AND YOU HERE ABOUT THE STUFF LIKE NEGATIVE EYE ON I THERA BE IT SOUNDS CRAZY RIGHT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YO WOULDONLY HEARE ABOUT A ASILAN OR IN BIG SIR TURNS OUT NEGTIVE EY ONIZATION THAT THERABY FOR SLEEP AND MOOD IS BASED ON REALLY AMAZING WORK OUT OF COLUMBIA BY GYNAN MICHAEL TERMAN THE NOBELL PRIZE I THINK T WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN WAS GIVEN FOR PHOTOTHERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF LUPAS LIKE THIS IDEA THAT CERTAIN WAVELANE SOB LIGKT CAN HELP TREAT MEDICAL CONDITIONS IS NOT A NEW IDEA BUT SOMEHOW WE SEE A RED LIGHT WERE NOT USED TO SEEIN RED LIGHTS EXCEPT IN SUNSETS AND ON STOP LIGHTS AND SOMEHOW IT BOTHERS PEOPLE OR IT MAKES THEM FEEL LIK  IT UNDERMINES A UM A BUSINESS MODEL THAT DOESN'T TAKE RED LIGHT INTO CONSIDERATION RIGHT UNTIL IT DOES AND THEN IT WAS AND THEN IT'S COOPTED THERE AND THE PLACE THAT WHAT I LOOK TO HIS ACUPUNCTURE YEL FOR A LOT OF YEARS PEOPLE SAID WELL ACUPUNCTURER THIS IS LIKE NO MECHANISM NO MECHANISM OR MECA THERE'S A A LAB AT HARVARD GYNAME CHUFUMA I KNO REASONABLY WELL WHOSE LABORATORIES DEDICATE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF ACUPUNCTURE AND THEYARE DISCOVERING WHAT EVERYONE HAS KNOWN FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS WHICH IS THAT INCREDIBLE EFFECTS ON ANTI INFLAMMATION THE GOT MYCRO MM SO A I'VE A FRIEND WHO WAS HAVING A TERRIBLE BACK PROBLEM AND I SUGGESTED THAT HE SEE AN ACU PUNCTUOUS AND HOU WENT TO THE ACCUPUNCTURE THAT I SUGGESTED AND HIS FACK PROBLEM COMPLETELY HEALED ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY AND I ASSEIM YOU KNOW HAVE YOU BEEN KEEPING OUT BECAUSE HE GET ANOTHER ANOTHER FLARIP IS AC NI I CAN'T GO BACK THERE BECAUSE ACU PUNCTURE AS A WORK AS IT WILL IT YOU SAW IT WORK FOR OU TE CAPITIS NOF SCIENCE HE'S GOT IT THERE IS NOW THERE'S GOOD SCIENCE AND PUBLISHED IN PRIMIAR JOURNALS IT YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING IS IS A LIBIT OF SCIENCE EDITORIAL BUT SINCE WE LIKE TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH AND THINGS THAT SORT THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF A JOURNAL DICTATES WHAT GETS EXPUBLISH IN WHAT DOESN'T AND THE PREMER JOURNALS HAVE A AN OUTSIZED EFFECT ON WHAT THE MEDIA COVERS AND SO THE BEAUTIFUL THING IS THE JOURNAL STAFF NOW IS OF THE AGE THAT THEY GREW UP HEARING ABOUT ACUPUNCTURE HYPNOSIS HAS A POWERFUL CLINICAL A FACT IF IT'S DONE RIGHT UM YOUL GAN NEE DRA AND SIMILAR PRACTICES AND SO THE TIDES ARE CHANGING BUT I SOMETIMES LIKE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK WHATER WE CONFRONTED WITH NOW THAT SEEMS CRAZY THAT IN TEN YEARS THE KIDS THAT WILL BE THE AS TO ME THEIR KIDS WILL BE JOURNAL EDITORS MIKE OH YE ABSOLUTELY UM YOU KNOW I'M MAKING THIS UP BUT PUTTING TUNING FORKS AGAINST YOUR HEAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE SOUND SOUND WAVE THERABY UM I THINK WHEN ONE ADOPTS A STANCE OF WE WE HAVE TO FILTERE EVERYTHING THROUGH THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR BIOLOGY BUT ALSO THROUGH THE E SOCIAL SOCIOLOGY OF A LIKE THE WAY CULTURE GOES IT BECOMES A DIFFERENT STORY HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT NOT JUST IN TERMS OF OF HEALTH BUT IN TERMS OF UM THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING SELNDS LIKE YOU DON'T SPEND A WHOLE LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THINK IS COOL OR NOT NO I HER HERE A HAR YEYOU STILL ARE I CAN'T I GA I JUST KNOW WHAT I LIKE IN WHAT I KDOWN'T I KNOW IT WORKS FOR ME WHAT DOESN'T YOU KNO I TRY THINGS AND I'M CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR NEW BETTER SOLUTIONS TO ANYTHING AND WHEREVER THEY COME FROM DOS MATTER IT COULD COME FROM IT COME FROM STAMFORD OR IT COULD COME FROM THE GI A TALKING HIMSELF ON THE STREET IF IT WORKS I'M GOOD AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME AT ALL II DON'T HOLD DEM I DON'T HOLD ANY OF IT TIGHTLY FORTUNATELY THERE'S NOW A DIVISION OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH CALLED UM COMPLIMENTARY HEALTH COMPLIMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH AND IT'S IT IT'S AMAZING AND SEE SEE I AGE AS RUN BY A WOMAN WHO HAS PUBLISHED ON  THIS IS INTERESTING THE A SOME OF THE ANTI CAN'T SIR EFFECTS OF THINGS LIKE ACUPUNCTURE I'M NOT THAT I COMPUNCTURE CAN CURE ALL CANCERS BUT BUT REAL ENT REAL DATA UM THAT I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY OF THE GENERATION ABOVE US YOU KNOWT THEY JUST ILIKE NOT INTERESTED IT IT SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON THE AM ANDREW WILES THE PUL STANDMENTS IS UM YOU KNOW THAT THE WILD ONES A OZUN THERE'BYR THERE'S SO MANY THERE'S SO MANY CAN LOOK I YOU FOR LONG TIME NUTRITION WAS JUST THOUGHT OF AS SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YO IT'S IT'S WHAT MEDICINE YOU TAKE IN WHAT YOU KNOW IT'S IXS THE FOOD IS EVERYTHING FOOD FOOD IS A POWERFUL A POWERFUL VARIABLE IN THE LANDSCAPE OF A VON LY NUTRICION IT ITS SORT ONE OF THE THIRD RAILS FOR ANY ONE LIKE MYSELF WHOS OUT THERE ON SOCIA MIT YOU DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF PUTTING OUT POSTS ON TWITTER AND IN SURRAND BUT EACH DAY YOU TAKE GET DOWN YOU PUT UP A NEW ONE AND I DON'T TALK ABOUT ANY I ONLY TALK ABOUT I YOU KNOW I TALK ABOUT CREATIVE IDEAS I DON'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING SPECIFIC RELATED TO M ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUKNW MAY BE SOMETHING LIKEDON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU HRIT EXACTLY A WELL IN THE LANDSCAPE OF NUTRICIAN SOMETIMES I I NOW PLACE IT THROUGH THE FILTER OF A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING YOU'VE GOT YOUR YOU'RE VEGANS IN YOUR OMIN OF ORDERS AND YOUR UM YOUR CARNIV WORE M D AND YOU'VE GOT LIVER KING AND YU GOT EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN RIGHT SO YOU COULD TRANSLATE THAT TO ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS FASHION PROBABLY HAS ITS PEOPLE I'M JUST NOT AWARE FOR THAT MUSIC HAS THEIRS AND UM SPORTS HAS THEIRS AND SCIENCE HAS THEIRS CHARACTERS SO ARE WE ALL JUST PRO WRESTLING LIKE CHARACTERS IN THESE DIFFERENT DOMAINS AND WE'RE TAKING OURSELVES AN EACH OTHER WAY TOO SERIOUSLY IT'S ALL WE'D WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING IT'S ALL IF SOMEONE HAS AN IDEA AN IT SOUNDS INTERETING YOU TRY IT AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK IT'S OKAD TRY SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE AN EMPIRICIST YE WHATEVER WORKS WET IT WORKS AND IF SOMETHING SEEMS INTERESTING TO YOU AND YOU'RE EXCITED BY IT WHY NOT TRY IT IT'S YOU KNO I TRIED VERY FRINGY THINGS I LIKE IN SOME WAYS THE MORE UM UNREALISTIC IT SEEMS SOM MORE INTERESTING IT IS TO ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THAT'S GETTING CLOSER TO SOMETHING THAT DONE SOMEBODY DOESN'T WANT ME TO KNOW YOU KNOW BUT YOU'RE NOT A BIG DRUG GUY LIKE THE BIG PSYCHADELIC CRAZE THAT'S HAPPENING NOW AND THAT HAPPENED YONG YOURS NO I'M NOT AGAINST IT IT'S JUST HAS NEVER BEEN SOMETHING THAT I'VE DONE YEW YETHAT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING AREA THAT'S TEFFLING MAKING IT HADWAY INSIDE OF STANDARD ACANEMIC SCIENCE IN MEDICINE NOW UM SO THAT I'M INTERESTED NON PHARM PHARMOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO THINGS WHATEVER THEY ARE  I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT ALSO THAT BEHAVIOUR OLD DUWS AND NOTS AT FIRST ARE THAT THEY'RE THE MOST FUN TO EXPLORER BECAUSE IN GENERAL AN LESS IT'S SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW AM JUMPING BETWEEN A BUILDINGS DOING PARCORESELING IT BUT MOST TO TIME YOU'RE NOCAN A INJURE HARM YOURSELF AND THERE'S MORE ROOM FOR ITERATION THAN THERE IS WITH A PILLAR OF POTION UM ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW CERTAINLY FARM A COLLOGY HAS ITS PLACE SO YOU'VE HAD CREAT OF WORKS CERTAINLY WITHIN THE REALM OF MUSIC ALSO COMEDY AND PRODUCING FILM AND OTHER THINGS FOR SOMEBODY OUT THERE WHO OF WHATEVER AGE THAT THEY MAYBE THEY'RE CREATING MAYBE THEY THEY THEYRE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE THIS CREATIVE UNTEN I NOT THE SOURCE IS OUTSIDE UM WHAT WAS IT THAT TRUMMER SAID I USSUE WROTE THIS ON THE WALL OF MY LABORATORY NO IN PUT NO OUTPUT WE THAT'S STRUMMERS LAW IT'S WRITTEN IN MY LABORATORY THE PEOPLE MY LAVERS AR LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE I THINK ONE GUO UNDER KNEW WING I WAS BUT ITE'S A PICTURE OF HIM AND PICTURE MY BULL DOG AND YOKNOW IN PUT NO OUT BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN JUST STAY IN A ROOM WITH FOUR WALLS IN A CEILING NOTHING ELSE AND AND CREATE I MEAN I KNOW THAT THERE'S CERTAIN NUMBER OF THINGS IN HERE BUT I I DO THINK ACCESSING THE WORLD IS AMAN IN WORLD IS GIVING US CLUES ALL THE TIME FOR PAINTENTION IT'S MEN PART OF IT I  YOU PAYIN ATTENTION THING THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS BEING EITHER WHISPERED OR SCREAM TO YOU IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD IF YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION WELL IN I'VE I I FORGET THE EXACT TITLE OF THE CHAPTER BUT OM THERE'S A CHAPTER ABOUT STAYING OPEN TO CLUES OR OR BEING ON THE LOOK OUT FOR CLUES NOW I'E FEEL TEMPTED TO LOOK FOR THE EXACT TITLE OF THAT CHAPTER BUT SO BE LOOK FOR CLUES AS IY THEY LOOK FOR CLUES SOUNDS I AT SOUNDS RIGHT AND SINCE YOU WROTE IT OM COM GUSSONANS RAHT UM SO DO YOU THINK THEY'RE CLUES IN IN EVERY EVERYWHERE YES ITHINK THEYRE CLES EVERYWHERE FOR IF WE PAY ATTENTION WELL HOURE FRASE  TRIGGERIM A THOUGHT WE'LL SEE SOMETHING UNEXPECTED UM IN IF SOME ONE RECOMMENDE SOMETHING TO YOU MAYBE IT'S A COINCIDENCE IF THREE PEOPLE RECOMMENCINGTHING TO YOU MAY IT'S NOT OU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHO KNOWS I DO BELIEVE THE UNIVERSE IS ON THE SIDE OF CREATIVITY AND THE UNIVERSE IS SUPPORTING THINGS TO HAPPEN AND THEY CAN HAPPEN THROUGH YOU OR THEY COULD HAPPEN THROUGH SOME ONE ELSE SO IF YOUR PAY ATTENTION MAYBE'LL HAPPEN THROUGH YOU WE HAD A GUESS ON THE PYCESTNIME JUST IN SONOBER HE'S AN EXPERT IN THE GOT MYCRO BYOM AND HE APPLIED SOMETHING THAT WITHOUT KNOWING HE APPLIED THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE PRINCIPLE I'L WEE TIE ABOUT THESE TRILLINGS HAVE GOT MYCRO BYODA THAT CLEARLY ARE DOING AMAZING THINGS TO CREATE OR TRANSMITTER IS IN GOVERNOUR BRAIN AND EVEN DECISION MAKING HOW MUCH SUGAR IS IN OUR SYSTEM DRIVING APPETITE T CETERA AND HE SAID YOU KNOW WE THINK OF THEM AS CARGO WELL I MAYBE WORE JUST VEHICLES AND THEY'RE IN CHARGE YTHAT ALL OF OUR INTERACTIONS LAC EVERY TIME WE SHAKE HANDS OR TOUCH OR IS WERE EXCHANGING GOT MICROBIOTA AND WE THINK OF INTELLIGENCE AS A AS THINKING AN INTELLIGENCE AND HE'S A A MICROBIOLOGIST AND IN IN ALL SERIOUSNESS HE SAID MAYBE WERE THE ONES BEING MANIPULATED WERE THE HOUSE CATS AND WE THINK HERE WE ARE WERE FALLING IN LOVE AND KISSING AND SHAKING HANDS AND WASHING HANDS AND A DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO ISOLATOR OR CONNECT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND MAYBE THEY GOT MICRO BY OTORE REALLY TRYING TO OPTIMIZE THEIR STHAT'S WHAT DEM LERD HAMILTON SAID THAT ON POINT IN THE SONA THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SON AN IT'S REALLY HOT THE FEELING THAT YOU HAVE OF WANTING TO GET OUT COULD BE THE BAD CRITTERS IN YOUR BODY THAT THE CAN'P HANDLEI  LET'S GET AT A ARE'T STRYING TO CONVINCE YOU FROM THE INSIDE TO GET OUT MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THE THAT FEELING OF BEING COMPELLED TO GET OUT COMES FROM SO ELON GETTING US ALL TO MARS MIGHT BE A BIT OF UM MAYBE THEY JUST WANT TO GET TO MARS AND SO THERE A MAYBE AS I'M STARNGTO FEEL LIKE AM CHANNELLING LIKE FREEDMEN HERE FOR A MOMENT NOW I THINK THIS CONSIDERING THE OPPOSITE AS REALLY HE AND WHILE IT MIGHT SOUND MYSTICAL TO PEOPLE OR LITTLE IT LIKE WE'RE JUST PLAYING WITH IDEAS THIT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO IN SCIENCE SOME ONE WALKS IN WITH A RESULT AND SAYS I FOUND THIS THIS IS TRUE AN YOU SAV BUT WHITIF IT'S ALL SOMETHING ELSE A GOOD EXAMPLE MIGHT BE HERE I'M PULLING FROM PI CASTS EPIZODES O THAT WE'VE HAVE BUT A LEOCROME UM IS THIS AMAZING PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WERE SON BELIEF OF FACTS YOUR KNOWLEDGE STRONGLY SHAPES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOMING SHE HAD THE AMAZING GRADUATE THESE AS WERE SHE SAID WOULD IF ALL OF EXERCISES PLACIBO ALL OF IT YE HAVE BURN SOME CALORIES AND DOES SOME THINGS TURNS OUT THIS ISN'T THE CASE BUT IN TURNS OUT A LOT OF THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE POSIVE EFFAECTS LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE RELIEVING STRASS POSIBEN OR PLACIBO AND BUT NOBODY THINKS OF IT LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE SO ATTACHED TO CALORIES BURNED ET CETERA I THINK THAT'S A BIG POINT THAT THE BELIEF PART OF IT IS A HUGE PART OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERYTHING IN WHAT WE BELIEVE HAS POWER IF WE BELIEVE WE COULD MAKE SOMETHING GREAT THE CHANCE OF US MAKING SOMETHING GREAT A BETTER THAN IF WE DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN SO AH I IOULD SAY ANY A BILITY THARNESS YOUR BELIEF ON YOUR BEHALF IS REALLY HEALTHY THING TO DO AND ONE THING THAT YOU MAKE VERY CLEAR S THAT WHILE OUR OWN ABILITIES MAY COME INTO QUESTION FROM TIME TO TIME YOU ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT THE ELEMENTS FROM WHICH TO CREATE ARE OUT THERE ABSOLUTELY ALL ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE ARE ARE YEURE EVERYTHING IS HERE WE GET T PICKINSHUS WE GET THE CONVEYRVILTS GOING BY WITH LITTLE TELITTLE GIFTS AND WE CAN FIRST FIR UST WEAVE DENOTICE THERE'S A CONVEY ABOUT THEN WE NOTICE THE GIFTS AND AN THAT'S THE STARTING POINT A MEN WE MAY EVEN FEEL A  EMPOWERED ENOUGH TO GRAB ONE OF THE GIFTS AND OPEN IT UP AND SEE WHAT'S INSIDE MEN ME THAT'S START  SOMETHING REALLY BEAUTIFUL THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE WE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE EVERYTHING EVERYTHING THAT THAT I'D MAKE OR HAVE MAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN BESED ON SOMETHING THAT I SEE OR HEAR THAT ALLOWS ME TO SEE SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE S I WAS CAN TO ASK YOU WHETHER NOT IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE HAPPY IN ORDER TO CREATE BUT CERTAINLY LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WE'RE UNHAPPY WERE STILL ABLE TO CREATE BUT THE MORE I LISTEN TO YOU IT SEEMS THAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT AN ABILITY TO PAY ATTENTION YES SO IF I'M UNHAPPY OR IF I'M HAPPY MAY NOT BE AS RELEVANT AS WETHER NOT OT I'M ABLE TO STAY UNDISTRACTED YES I WOULD SAY THAT'S I WAS SAY BEIN ABLE TO STATE PRESENT IN THE WORK IS PROBABLY THE MOST MOST IMPORTANT PART OF IT AND HOW YOU FEEL IS LESS OF AN ISSUE IN TH LESS HOW YOU FEEL GETS IN THE WAY OF YOU FEELING HOW THE WORK MAKES YOU FEEL IN WHAT I'M SAYING IF YOU'RE IN A LOT OF PAIN AND YOU'R LOOKING AT A PIECE OF ART IT MAY BE HARD TO KNOW HOW THAT ART MAKES YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOU'RE ETHE BIG SIGNAL IN YOUR BODY IS THE PHYSICAL PAIN I'M SURE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO CAN DO THAT TO WHO CAN EVEN THROUGH THE PHYSICAL PAIN CAN FEEL IT THERE'S TIS IDEA OF TRANSMUTATION OF TAKING ONE EMOTION AND CONTORTING IT AND COOPTING IT INTO ANOTHER ACTION IN AN ADAPTIVE WAY BUT THIS IDEA OF DISTRACTION BEING A PROBLEM I I THIS REALLY RESONATES I THINK UM WHEN I THINK OF TIMES OF GREAT PRODUCTIVITY IS WHEN I WAS ABLE TO BE UNDISTRACTED THIT I COULD ALSO SEE HOW SUCCESS CAN BE ITS OWN DISTRACTION THIS IS OFTEN DISCUSSED IN THE CONTECTS OF FIGHTING SPORTS WHERE SOME ONE STARTS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY AND PRETTY SOON THEIR FOCUSS BECOMES ALL THE THINGS THEY CAN ACCESS WITH THEIR SUCCESS AS SUPPOSE OF THE THING THEY GOT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE OM KEEPING AN UNDER DOG MENTALITY YET NOW BEFORE WE CONCLUDE I DO ONE ASK YOU ABOUT ONE OTHER ASPECT OF PROCESS WHICH IS MEDITATION A MEDITATION AN IS INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE WHEN WE CLOSE OUR EYES AS MOST MEDITATIONS ARE DONE AND WE FOCUS ON OUR BRAIN OUR BRAIN HAS NO SENSATION LIKE IF WE I WOULDN'T SEY WE FOCUS ON ON BRAIN OH OR WE FOCUSS ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN OUR NORMAL EXPERIENCE THAT HOW WOULD YOU DEFIND MEDITATION WELL IT'S DIFFERENT THE'RE A DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDITATION USUALLY EITHER WAY WEI WOULD SAY THERE'S NO FORM OF MEDITATION OVER FOCUS ONER BRAKIN O LATEWE DIS AGI WOULD SAY HERE THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WE EITHER ARE ENGAGING IN A MONTRA WHICH WOULD BE AVERSION OF A ALMOST LIKE A CREATING A TRANCE FOR OURSELVES NOT UNLIKE LISTENING SOMETHING WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP THAT WOULD DISTRACT OUR CONSCIOUS MIND FROM PARTICIPATING WE WOULD BE OVERRIDING AR A THE THE TALKING MIND WITH JUST A SOUND THAT WE'RE GENERATING OR WORD OR A PHRASE SERIES OF PHRASES IT MEDIMETIT META MEDITATION IS OFN A LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATION WITH PHRASES COULD BE THAT A WORK COULD BE FOCUSSED ON THE BREATH BUT THE PURPOSE OF BEING FOCUSSED ON THE BREATH IS TI NOT HER THE SELF TALK THAT WE NORMALLY HAVE IT'S A IT'S A SINGLE POINTED FOCUS EXERCISE IN THOSE THAT I DESCRIBE THE OTHER VERSION IS 'T AWARENESS MEDITATION WE YOURE CLOSING YOUR EYES AND YOUR BEING WITH WHATEVER IS AND NOTICING SO IF WE WERE TO DO IT NOW AN HAND YOU COUN DOITEYES OPENER EYES CLOSE WITHIN AWARENESS PRACTICE BUT THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD DO IS I WOULD FEEL A I FEEL LITTLE RINGING IN MY HEARS MIGHT BE FROM ME ALETRONIC EQUIPMENT AROUND US THAT I DON'T MEAN THAT I HEAR THE SOUND IT'S LIKE A A VIBRATION I HEAR CARS PASSING IN THE DISTANCE SEE WHAT ELSE COMES UP I CAN FEEL A FEELING IN MY CHEST I CAN FEEL ON THIS PART OF MY FACE NOT SURE WY EEL LIKE IT'S RELATED TO MY JAW MOR CAR SOUNDS IAM AWERE OF A LITTLE FEELING OF WARMTH YOSO NOW IWOULD SAY THE ROOM IN THE ROOM FEELS A BIT WARM I WAS 'T AWARE THAT BEFOR WHEN I WASN'T JUST BEING WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING I FEEL LITTLE ITCH ON MY LEFT SHOULDER SO IN THATTHAT WOULD BE IN AWARENESS PRACTICE WHICH IS ANOTHER KIND OF MEDITATION WE ARE JUST HING INTENTION WHAT'S GOING ON THERE'S NO STORY THIS NOW THIS MEANS THIS NONE OF THOSE THINGS JUST LIKE AN INVENTORY ALMOST OF EVERYTHING THAT COMES UP WHEN IT COMES UP AND YOU DO THAT FOR PREETO TIME BUT IN IN ALL THOSE CASES AND IN THE EXAMPLE OF DOING THE WARENESS MEDITATION OR DOING A MONTRAMEDITATION OR FOCUSING ON THE BREATH IN NONE OF THEM AM I THINKING AND ANOTHER MI CONCENTRATING ON I'M O I'M I'M BEING AWARE OF THE OF SENSE PERCEPTIONS IN THE AWARENESS ONE OR IN THE OTHER MEDITATIONS I'M DOING A PRACTICE SO THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE WHEN DO YOU START MEDITATING AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEDITATE NOW I LEARNED WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND AT I STARTED WITH T M AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE THE MEDITATION THAT I'VE DONE THE MOST IN MY LIFE AND I COME BACK TO ALTHOUGH I TRIED MANY DIFFERENT KINDS IM AND ALSO DIFFERENT PHYSICAL FORMS OF MEDITATION TICHE THINGS LIKE THAT I MEDITATED FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS AND THEN I STOPPED WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL TO TO UNIVERSITY AND THEN I STARTED AGAIN SEVERAL YEARS LATER AND WHEN I STARTED AGAIN I REALIZED HOW PROFOUND IT WASN'T IN ME THAT I HAD DONE IT WHEN I DID IT SO I USUALLY OF SOME SORT OF A SOME SORT OF A PRACTICE IN SOME WAYS THE BEACH WALKS COULD BE A FORMER MEDITATION IM BUT THE FOR ME TYPICALLY I WOULD WAKE UP IT BE THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO DURING THAT STARTED IN BETWEEN TIME MAYBE GO OUT IN THE SUN CLOSE MYCEN MEDITATE BEFOR STARTING MY DAY II IF I'M DOING IT TWICE A DAY THE SECOND TIME WOULD PROBABLY BE RIGHT BEFORE DINNER IF I'M DOING IT ON A REGULAR SCHEDUL THEN IF  IF I FIND MYSELF ON AN AEROPLANE I MIGHT MEDITATE FOR AN HOUR OR FOR  I'VE CAN REMEMBER ONE TIME MEDITATING THE ENTIRE FLIGHT FROM NEW YORK TO ELAY JUST WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO A DEEP DIVE I AND TIME PASSES YOU LOSE TRACK O TIME AN O YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S LIKE GOING TO SLEEP IN WAKING UP YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT WAS EIGHT HOURS YOU KNOW IT'S JUST TIME STOPS IM NOT ALWAYS BUT WHEN IT DOES ITS GREATYE YOU'VE SENT ME SOME MEDITATIONS AND AND CLEAN THE ONE THAT YOU DID ON THAT TRANSATLANTIC IR TED TRANS CONTNENTAL FLIGHT AN AND IM I THEN TRY TO GET DE LONGER AND LONGER MEDITATIONS BUT A'NM I'VE ALWAYS MEDITATE A LITTLE TAT BUT YOUR MDITATEION PRACTICE AS ONE I'MS TRYING TO ADOPT IF I MAYBE WE COULD COMMITSEE TO GIVE US E SUGGESTIONS OF ONE OR TWO AND WE CAN LINK OUT TO THEM FOR LISTENER SOR THERE'S APPRECIATE AND THERE'S ALSO IM MEDITATION LIKE PRACTICES TO DO THAT NVALVUM LIKE THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE UM THE SURGICAL SERIES FROM THE MONRO INSTITUTE WHICH I USED WHEN I HAD A SURGERY YOU'D LISTENED TO THIS RECORDING AND IT BOTH ALLOWS YOUR BODY TO HEEL MUCH FASTER AND A REMOVE F SOME OF THE TRAMA THAT GOES ON WHEN YOU NAV GETTING CUT UP AN IT'S DRAMATIC UM BUT JUST THROUGH LISTENING CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN MAM COMMAN REALLY POWERFUL EFFECT YOL MUCH FASTER REMEMBER UM I WAS ABOUT TO BE PUT UNDER FOR SURGERY AND AM MS WERE CLOSE AND I WASN'T UM COMMUNICATING WITH ANY ONE THERE BECAUSE I WAS GOING INSIDE AND UM  AN MY WIFE WAS WITH ME AND ME CAME IN AND MAY SAID O UM SO THE RATY GAVE IC THE SENITIV BECAUSE HOU REEE WILLINGN AN MANYTHING IS LIKE BUT LOOK AT HIS NUMBERS E I LOVE IT YET'S IT IT'S A THAT IT'S AN AMAZINGLY POWERFUL PRACTICE II LIKE AUSE ANY ONE CAN CULTIVATE SH NO ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY HO'S AN ENDER'S NO GOOD OR BAD VERSION IT REALLY IS JUST IF YOU LEARNA TECHNEQE AND SHOW UP AND DO IT IT WORKS WELL I LOVE THAT YOU'RE SO WILLING TO SHARE WHAT YOU DO AND YOUR PROCESS AND IS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS I WANT TO THANK

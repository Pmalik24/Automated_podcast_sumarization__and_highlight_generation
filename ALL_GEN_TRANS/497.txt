WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LATPONEN  A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TON  LI MAYDRHUBERMEN AND ONM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TO DAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TIME PERCEPTION OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME IS PERHAPS VEMOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HOW WE GAUGE OUR LIFE THAT IS WHETHER R NOT WE THINK WE ARE BEING SUCCESSFUL WHETHEROR NOT WE ARE FAILING WHETHER OR NOT WE LIVE IN FEAR WHETHER OR NOT WE LIVE IN RELATION TO THINGS IN AWAY THAT'S POSITIVE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE NEURO CHEMICAL STATES THAT CONTROL MOOD STRESS HAPPINESS EXCITEMENT AND OF COURSE IT FRAMES THE WAY IN WHICH WE EVALUATE OUR PAST SO WHETHER NOT WE THINK OF OUR PAST AS SUCCESSFUL OR UNSUCCESSFUL IT FRAMES OUR PRESENT WHETHER NOT WE THINK WE ARE ON TRACK OR OFF TRACK AND IT FRAMES OUR SENSE OF THE FUTURE WHETHER OR NOT WE THINK WE HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE A DIM FUTURE OR WHETHER NOT THE FUTURE IS VERY UNCERTAIN OR NOT TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF TIME PERCEPTION AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS THAT YOU CAN USE THAT CAN INHANCE YOURABILITY TO DILATE AND CONTRACT TIME WHEN WE MEAN BY DILATE AND CONTRACT TIME WE CON CONTROL THE SPEED AT WHICH WE EXPERIENCE LIFE WE CAN SLOW THINGS DOWN OR WE CAN SPEED OUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE UP AND WE CAN DO THAT IN A VERY DIRECT AN DYNAMIC WAY S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TIME PERCEPTION WORKS SO THAT'S WHET WERE HEADED I THINK YOU CAN COME AWAY FROM TO DAY'S EPISODE WITH A LOT OF NEW KNOWLEDGE AND CERTAINLY WITH MANY TOOLS THAT YOU CAN TRY IN YOUR DAILY LIFE WHETHER R NOT THAT'S WORK SPORT RELATIONAL EMOTIONAL AND SO ON BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT TIME PERCEPTION I'D LIKE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THAT I RECEIVE RELATED TO THE EPISODE ON FASTING AND TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT EPISODE THIS INFORMATION SHOULD STILL BE OF USE TO YOU TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING INVOLVES EATING FOR PARTICULAR PERIOD OF TIME IN EACH TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE THAT'S FAIRLY REGULAR STHIS WOULD BE AN EIGHT HOUR MOST OFTEN OR A TEN HOUR BLOCKS ON PEOPLE DO SHORT SHORTER FEEDING WINDOWS BUT REGARDLESS THAT FEEDING WINDOW IS TUPPOSE TO FALL AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME PERIOD WITHIN EACH TWENTY FOR OUR DAY THIS HAS A NUMBER PAUSIVE EFFECTS ON GENE EXPRESSION THAT REGULATE A NUMBER OF POS EFFECTS ON THE DIFFERENT TISSUES OF THE BODY AND FOR SOME PEOPLE NOT ALL BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE MAKES WEIGHT LOST EASIER BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY ARE NOT EATING FOR LARGE PERIODS OF EACH TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCLE IN ANY EVENT ONE OF THE MAJOR QUESSIONS I GOT AFTER THAT EPISODE WAS DO SUPPLEMENTS BREAK A FAST AND DURING THAT EPISODE I TALKED ABOUT WHAT BREAKS A FAST IS HIGHLY CONTEXTUAL IT BASICLY BOILS DOWN TO WHETHE OR NOT SOMETHING YOU INJEST WHETHER IT BE LIQUID OR FOOD INCREASES YOUR RESTING BLOOD GLUCOS HOW MUCH IT ROUT INCREASES THAT RESTING BLOOD GLUCOS AND HOW LONG THAT INCREASE LAST SO YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE EPISODE FOR MORE ABOUT WHAT BREAKS A FAST BUT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND WHETHER NOT SUPPLEMENTS AF PARTICULAR BREAK OF FAST MANY OF THE QUESTIONS WHEREABOUT ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS A SPONSOR OF THIS PODCAST IT IS ALSO A TERIFIC SUPPLEMENT THAT I HAVE BEEN TAKING FOR MORE THAN A DECATE BEFORE THIS PODCAST LAUNCHED AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING AND CONTINUED TO USE ATHLETIC GREENS DOES ATHLETIC GREENS BREAK A FAST WILL THAT WILL SOMEWHAT DEPEND ON WHETHER OR NOT YOUR RESTING BLOOD GLUCOS TENDS TO RUN HIGH OR LOW BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING ME BECAUSE I'VE MEASURED IT IN JESTING ATHLETIC GREENS DOES NOT BREAK A FAST AND IF IT HAPPENS TO BREAK A FAST IT WOULD BE A VERY TRANSIENT BREAK IN FAST SO WITHOUT KNOWING ARRESTING BLOOD GLUCOS LEVELS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THERE'S NOWHAY I CAN SAY FOR SURE THAT IT DOESN'T BREAK A FAST BUT CHANCES ARE IT DOES NOT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T CONTAIN MUCH CARBOHIDRATE OR SUGAR AND IT DOESN'T TEND TO THEREFORE PULL YOU OUT OF THE MALECULAR MILU AS SOCIATED WITH LOW BLOOD GLUCO STATES THE OTHER QUESTION I GET IS WHETHER NOT THINGS LIKE FISH OIL BREAK A FAST AND ONCE AGAIN THIS WILL BE CONTEXTUAL BUT BECAUSE FISH OIL IS A FAT AN ESSENTIAL IT MAINLY IF ESSENTIAL PHADIACIDS IN PARTICULAR EPA IN D CA THOSE DON'T TEND TO RAISE BLOOD GLUCOS VERY MUCH IN MY CASE HAVING MEASURED USING IN CONTINUOUS GLUCOSMONITOR MY RESTING LOGLUCOS FISH OIL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE MY RESTING BLOOD GLUCOS CHANCES ARE IT WON'T DO THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE AS WELL SO DOES FISH OIL BREAK A FAST CHANCES ARE IT DOES NOT AND OF COURSE PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT PILLTYPE SUPPLEMENTS YOU KNOW CAFINE AND THINGS THAT RAISE DOPOMINE AND THEIR VITEMENTS IN MINERALS IN GENERAL IF SOMETHING DOESN'T CONTAIN SUGAR OR MUCH CARBOHYDRATE OF ANY KIND IT'S NOT GOING TO RAISE BLOOD GLUCOS VERY MUCH NOW OF COURSE PROTINE CAN RAISE BLOOD GLUCOS AND FAT CAN TO AS WELVE ALTHOUGH TO A LESS OR EXTENT SO AGAIN THIS IS ALL CONTEXTUAL BUT AT LEAST BY THE LOGIC THAT I JUST SPELLED OUT ATHLETIC GREENS FISH OIL AND MOST FORMS OF SUPPLEMENTS PROVIDED THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SUGAR OR PROTINE CONTENT SHOULD NOT QUOTENQUOTE BREAK A FAST BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THEREASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAST IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUT MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIO IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL IVE YOU FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK AM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFREE TRAVEL PACKS

RATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OF TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS POD CAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTOMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES IF YU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEIRE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TIME PERCEPTION AND THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF TIME PERCEPTION IS SOMETHING CALLED IN TRAINMENT IN TRAINMENT IS THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR INTERNAL PROCESSES YOUR BIOLOGY IN YOUR PSYCHOLOGY ARE LINKED TO SOME EXTERNAL THING AND THE MOST BASIC FORM OF EN TRAINMENT THAT WE ARE ALL A SLAVE TO ALL YEAR ROUND FOR OUR ENTIRE LIFE ARE SO CALLED CERCANUAL RHYTHMS WE HAVE NURONS NERVE CELLS IN OUR EYE IN OUR BRAIN END IN OUR BODY THAT ARE MARKING OFF THE PASSAGE OF TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR LITERALLY A CALENDAR SYSTEM IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THE WAY THIS WORKS IS BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE LIGHT SEEN BY YOUR EYES INHIBITS MEANING IT REDUCES THE AMOUNTS OF A HORMONE RELEASED IN YOUR BRAIN CALLED MELOTONEN MELETONEN HAS TOO MAJOUR FUNCTIONS ONE FUNCTION IS TO MAKE YOU SLEEPY AT NIGHT ND THE OTHER IS TO REGULATE SOME OF THE OTHER HORMONES OF THE BODY IN PARTICULAR TESTASTRONE AND ESTROGEN WHEN WE VIEW LIGHT WE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MALETONIAND RELEASED IN FACT IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT WHEN MALETONIAN TYPICALLY IS PRETTY HIGH IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND YOU FLIP ON A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE BATHROOM YOUR MELETONAN LEVELS CRASH DOWN TO ALMOST AS ZERO AND STAY THERE LIGHT IS A VERY POWERFUL MODULATOR OF MELATONAN AND LIGHT INHIBITS MELATONAN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE DAYLENGTH VARIES AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT FROM THE SUN THAT IS AVAILABLE TO YOU VARIES SO WHEN DAYS ARE LONG THE AMOUNT OF MELETONAN IN YOUR RAIN AND BODY THAT'S RELEASED TENDS TO BE LESS THERE'S LESS OF IT AND ITS RELEASED FOR SHORTER AMOUNTS OF TIME  BECAUSE LIGHT IN HIBITS MELATONAN WHEN DAYS ARE VERY SHORT THE AMOUNT OF MALETONAN THAT'S RELEASED AND THE DURATION THAT THAT MLETONIAN EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY TENDS TO BE BUTCH LONGER SO MELATONAN CORRELATES WITH DAYLENGTH AND IF WE ARE VIEWING MORE LIGHT WE HAVE LASS MALETONIAN REVIEW LESS LIGHT WE HAVE MORE  MELATONAN YOU SEE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF LIGHT EACH DAY BUT WE HAVE A PROCESS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT AVERAGE IS THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT THAT YOURE SEEING BOTH FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES AND FROM SUNLIGHT AND MEASURES THAT OFF AND IT SO EXQUISITELY PRECISE THAT FOR A GIVEN SAY EIGHT HOUR DAY IN THE SPRING BECAUSE SPRING IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE R ELSEWHERE YOU KNOW DAYS ARE GETTING LONGER THAT MEANS THAT THE AMOUNT OF MELETONAN IS GETTING PROGRESSIVELY LESS AND LESS AND THAT SIGNALASS CONVEYED TO ALL THE SYSTEMS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THIS IS WHY MOST PEOPLE NOT ALL BUT MOST PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MORE ENERGY IN THE SPRING CONVERSELY WHEN YOU HAVE AN EIGHT HOUR DAY IN THE WINTER THE AMOUNT OF MALETONAN THAT CORRESPONDS AT EIGHT OUR DAY IS GETTING PROGRESSIVELY GREATER AND GREATER BECAUSE WHY DAYS ARE GETTING SHORTER SO MELATONAN IS INCREASING FROM DAY TO DAY TO DAY EVERY SELLAND SYSTEM OF YOUR BODY PAYS ATTENTION TO THIS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE MOST PEOPLE NOT ALL BUT MOST PEOPLE FEEL THEY HAVE A LITTLE LESS OR SOMETIMES A LOT LESS ENERGY AND A SLIGHTLY LOWER MOOD IN THE WINTER MONTHS NWTHERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS OF COURSE BUT THE MELATONAN SIGNAL IS THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR INTERNAL STATE YOUR MOOD YOUR SENSE OF ENERGY EVEN YOUR APPETITE IS IN TRAINED IS MATCHED TO SOME EXTERNAL EVENT IN THIS CASE THE EVENT IS THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH AROUND THE SON THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF INTRAINMENT MEANING THE MATCHING OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY TO THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN YOUR EXTERNAL EN VIRONMENT ONE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS PUBLISHED LAST YEAR BY PARIC AT ALL IN SELL REPORT SELL PRESSJOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOW ING THAT ACROSS THE CALENDER YEAR THE AMOUNT OF TOSTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN THAT HUMAN BEINGS MAKE VARIES SUCH THAT IN LONGER DAYS THEY TEND TO MAKE MORE TESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN THAN IN SHORTER DAYS AND THIS WAS CORRELATED WITH THINGS LIKE  DESIRE TO SEEK OUT ROMANTIC PARTNERS OR HAVE ROMANTIC IN DRACTIONS WITH THEIR EXISTING PARTNERS EVEN AGGRESSION ALTHOUGH A NOT A VIOLENT AGGRESSION BUT SENSE OF CAN A WILLINGNESS TO ARGUE INTO TO GET INTO A KIND OF COMBATIVE STATES AND OVER ALL ENERGY AND MOOD THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN HYPOTHESIZE FOR A LONG TIME BUT IT NEVER REALLY BEEN CLEANLY DEMONSTRATED AND WHAT THEY SHOWED WAS THAT ITS ACTUALLY THE SKIN THAT'S TAKING INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT AND CONVERTING IT INTO THESE INCREASES IN TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGEN LIGHT EXPOSURE TO THE SKIN TURNS OUT ABOUT TWO HOURS A DAY THIS WAS SUNLIGHT IN THIS CASE TO THE UPPER BODY THESE PEOPLE WEREN'T NAKED THEY WERE WEARING CLOTHES BUT THEIR ARMS WERE EXPOSED ON THEIR UPPER BACK AND A NACK AND FACE WERE EXPOSED THEY WERE NOT WEARING HATS RESULTED IN LARGE INCREASE OF SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGEN NOW YOU COULD PROBABLY EXPORT A TOOL FROM THAT IF YOU LIKE A THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THIS PODCAST IS ABOUT BUT A ITS VERY CLEAR THAT BECAUSE THE SKIN IS ACTING AS AN INTRCRANE ORMAN THE ORGANSCUSE ME AS KIND OF A HORMONE INFLUENCING ORGAN THAT GETTING LIGHT ON THE SKIN NOT JUST TO THE EYES CAN INFLUENCE OUR SENSE OF WELL BEING BY THESE HORMONE PATHWAYS AND THE THRESHOLD THERE AGAIN SEEM TO BE ABOUT TWO HOURS A DAY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE VERY BRIGHT OUTSIDE THERE CAN BE CLOUD COVER AND SO ON MANY PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY ASK WILL SUN SCREEN INHIBIT THIS EFFACT AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT IT DOES OBVIOUSLY PRIORITIZE A SKIN HEALTH AND AN AVOIDING SKIN CANCER A SUNSCREEN IS KIND OF A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC NOWADAY AS I  MAY BE ATOPIC FOR ANOTHER A PODCAST EPISOTE AT SOME POINT BUT NONE THE LESS WHAT THE PARIC AT ALL STUDY SHOWS AND THAT'S MOST RELEVANT TO TODAY'S PODCAST IS THAT WE ARE IN TRAINED WE ARE MATCHED TO THE EXTERNAL LIGHT DARK CYCLE AND AS THE DAYLENGTH CHANGES OUR HORMONES CHANGE AND WE CAN OVERRIDE THAT WITH EXPOSURE A TO BRIGHT LIGHTS ON PEOPLE GOES ON TANNING BEDS A I HAS NOT A PRACTICE TAT PARTICULARLY A MYSELF A ENGAGIN BUT YOU KNOW THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFRENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN OVERRIDE THESE PROCESSIES BUT THE POINT IS VERY SIMPLE THE POINT IS THAT OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME IS BOTH CONSCIOUS YOU KNOW IT'S A WAITING WATCHING THE CLOCTIC DOWN AND THEIR THE SLOWER WHAT WE CALL OCILATORY MEANING UP AND DOWN REPEATEDLY SLOWER OCILATORY EVENTS RELATED TO DAYLENGTH THAT ARE INFLUENCING OUR HORMONES LIKE MALETONANTESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN AND THEREFORE OUR MOOD OUR OUTLOOK AND EVEN OUR BEHAVIOR THE NEXT LEVEL OF TIME OR BEEN OF TIME AS WE SAY THAT WE ARE ALL IN TRAINED OR MATCHED TO IS THE SO CALLED CIRCADIAN TIME CYCLE WHICH IS TWENTY FOUR HOUR RHYTHM THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL RHYTHM THAT WE ALL CONTAIN AND THAT NONE OF US CAN ESC APE FROM WE ALL HAVE THAT THIS CRCADEAN CLOCK THAT RESIDES OVER THE ROOF OF OUR MOUTH THE CELLS IN THAT CIRCADEAN CLOCK FIRE MEANING THE RELEASE CHEMICLES INTO OUR BRAIN AN BODY ONE A VERY REGULAR RHYTHM SO ACROSS THE TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCLE THEY WILL BE VERY ACTIVE AT SOME PERIODS AND LESS ACTIVE AT OTHERS NOT SURPRISINGLY THERE ARE PERIODS OF EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE WHEN WE ARE VERY ACTIVE AND WE TEND TO BE ALERT AND OTHERS WHEN WE ARE ASLEEP NOW HAVE TALKED TA LOT ABOUT CIRCADEAN RHYTHMSOM SLEEP ON THIS PODCAST PREVIOUSLY AND SO I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT TOO MUCH OF THAT INFORMATION IN DETAIL BUT I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE A SUMMARY OF HOW CIRCADEAN AND TRAINMENT WORKS BECAUSE I HAVENT REALLY COVERED THAT IN THE CONTACTS OF TIME PERCEPTION WE HAVE THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK IT OSCILLATES IT GOES UP AND DOWN ONCE EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND THEN REPEATS EVERY CELL OF OUR BODY HAS A TWENTY FOUR OUR OSCILLATION IN THE EXPRESSION OF VARIOUS GENES HOW THAT WORKS IS ACTUALLY REALLY SIMPLE ELEGANT AND INTERESTING DIANE GENES MAKE ARONE ARONE IS CONVERTED INTO PROATINES EVERY CELL IN OUR BODY HAS THIS BEAUTIFUL TWENTY FOUR HOUR TIMER WHERE A GENUS EXPRESSED AND THE IMPORTANTING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT A GIVEN GENE IN THIS CONTACT IS THAT THAT GENE IS INHIBITED MEANING ITS REDUCED BY A PARTICULAR PROTINE BY A LITTLE BIOLOGICAL MOLECULE IN THAT CELL SO THE GENE GETS EXPRESSED WHEN THERE'S VERY LITTLE OF THAT OTHER MOLECULEA ROUN D'ANE IS THEN BECOMES ARONE ARONE IS TRANS LATED INTO APPROACHINE AND THAT PROACHING GOES WAYWAY UP AND THE GENE SHUTS DOWN BUT AS THAT PROTINE GETS USED UP AND ITS LEVELS EVENTUALLY DROP LELELELELO TO ZERO THE GENE CYCLE CICKS IN AGAIN AND THE GENE GETS EXPRESS THE ARONE GETS EXPRESS IN THE PROTINE AGAIN THIS ALL HAPPENS ON A TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE SO IT'S A LITTLE BUILT IN TIMER ING EACH ING EVERY ONE OF OUR CELLS AND I DIDN'T LIST OFF THE GENES BUT FOR THE EFFYCINATOES OUT THERE THEY GO BY NAMES LIKE PUR FOR PERIOD BMAL CLOCK AND ALL THESE DIFFEN THINGS WE CALL THEM THE CLOCK GENES AND THOSE CLOCCINGS REGULATE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FUNCTION SO EVERY CELL IN OUR BODY HAS A TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE OF GENE AND PROATINE EXPRESSION AND THE EARTH ROTATES ONCE EVERY TWENTY FOR HOURS AND THE PROCESSES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN EVERY CELL OF OUR BODY AR LINKED THEY ARE INTRAINED AS WE SAY TO THE OUTSIDE LIKE DAUR CYCLE BECAUSE MORNING SUNLIGHT EVENING SUNLIGHT AND THE LACK OF LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MAKE SURE THAT THE CHANGES THESE OSCILLATIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING WITHIN THE CELLS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY ARE MATCHED TO THE OUTSIDE LIKHE DARK CYCLE NO ONE AR GOING TO ALL THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT HAPPENS BUT THERE SOME VERY SIMPLE TOOLS THAT ONE CAN USE TO INSURE THAT YOUR IN TRAINMENT YOUR CIRCADEAN AN TRAINMENT IS PRECISE AND I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOUR CIRCADEIAN AN TRAINME T BE PERCISE WHY BECAUSE DESRUPTIONS IN CIRCADEAN AN TRAINMENT CAUSE HUGE HEALTH PROBLEMS THEY INCREASE CANCER RISK THEY INCREASE OBESITY THEY INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THEY IN DECREASE WOUND HEALING THEY DECREASE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE THEY DISRUPT HORMONES YOU WANT YOUR CELLS TO BE LINKED TO THE CIRCADEAN CYCLE THAT'S OUTSIDE YOU AND THE CRCADEAN CYCLE OUTSIDE YOU MAINLY CONSISTS OF WHEN THEIRE'S SUNLIGHT AND WHEN THERE IS NOT AND THAT'S WHY THE SIMPLE PROTOCALS TO FALL OUT OF THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION AUHOUT CIRCADEAN IN TRAINMENT ARE THE FOLLOWING VIEW TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES OF BRIGHT LIGHT IDEALLY SUNLIGHT WITHIN AN HOUR OF WAKING ASSUMING THAT YOURE WAKING EARLY IN THE DAY ESPECIALLY YOU WAKE UP EARLY IN THE DAY GET OUTSIDE SEE SUNLIGHT DO THAT AGAIN IN THE AFTERNOON OR ROUND EVENING TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW BRIGHT IT IS OUTSIDE ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY OR IF YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE AND YOU WAKE UP EARLY AND THERE'S NO SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE YOU CAN OF COURSE TURN ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS IF YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE BUT BASELYOU WANT AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT IDEALLY FROM SUNLIGHT IN COMING IN THROUGH YOUR EYES THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THEND IN THE EVENING YOU WANT AS LITTLE BRIGHT LIGHT COMING IN THROUGH YOUR EYES IVE SAID THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS PODCAST THERE'S ALWAYS A LAT IN NEGOTIATIONS BUT I WANT TO MAKE A FEW THINGS CLEAR TRY NOT TO WEAR SUNGLASSES IF YOU CAN DO IT SAFELY FIND TO WEAR EYE GLASSES ARE CONTACTS THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM THE LIGHT VIEWING THAT YOU DO AND THE AVOIDANCE OF LIGHT AT NIGHT SET THE FUNDAMENTAL LAYER OF YOUR TIME PERCEPTION ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DESRUPT YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME IN THE WAYS THAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN THE SUBSEQUENT PORTIONS OF THE PODCASTS IS TO DISRUPT YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK AND THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO SO CALLED IN TRAIN YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO ENGAGE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AT FAIRLY REGULAR TIMES OF DAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT EVERY DAY BUT IF YOUARE GOING TO EXERCISE TRY AND EXERCISE AT A FAIRLY CONSISTENT TIME OF DAY PROBABLY BETTER TO EXERCISE THAN TO NOT EXERCISE EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO MOVE THAT TIME OF DAY BUT LIGHT ACTIVITY AND WILL TALK ABOUT THE THIRD IND A MINUTE FOOD ARE THE MAJOR WAYS THAT YOU IN TRAIN YOUR INTERNAL PERCEPTION OF TIME TO THE EXTERNAL EVENTS OF THE OF THE WORLD MEANING THAT THE TURNING OF OF THE EARTH AND THEREFORE THE EXPOSURE TO SUNLIGHT OR NOT SO IN ADDITION THE SUNLIGHT VIEWING IN THE MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND AVOIDING BRIGHT LIGHT AT NIGHT OF ANY KIND NOT JOUST BLUE LIGHT TRYING TO GET YOUR ACTIVITY YOUR EXERCISE AT FAIR FAIRLY REGULAR WITHIN PLUSSER MINE AS TWO HOURS FROM EACH DAY TO THE NEXT IS GOING TO HAVE A VERY PAUSIVE EFFACT ON SO CALLED CIRCADEAN IN TRAINMENT AND ALSO EATING AT FAIRLY REGULAR TIMES HOWEVER THIS IS EXCITING THE DAYTE A MAINLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT YOU NEED TO EAT WITHIN MORE OR LESS THE SAME TIME WINDOW EACH DAY NOT THAT YOU ALWAYS NEED TO EAT YOUR MEALS AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME SO YOU DON'T NESARELY HAVE TO EAT A LUNCH AT NOON AND SNACK AT FOR AND DINNER AT EIGHT IN ORDER TO KEEP YOUR CRCADEAN IN TRAINMENT A LINED OR A SHARP YOU COULD FOR INSTANCE HAVE A SMALL SNACK AT NOON AND THEN EAT AT TWO AND THEN HAVE DINNER AT SIX AND THEN A SMALL SNACK AT EIGHT IT DOESN'T SO MUCH MATTER WHEN THE EXACT MEALS FALL SO MUCH AS THAT THEY FALL MORE OR LESS WITHIN A CONSISTENT PERIOD OR PHASE OF EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS CIRCADEAN CLOCK STARTS GETTING DISRUPTED I MEAND THIS IS AFTER ALL AN EPISODE ABOUT TIME PERCEPTIONS NOT AN EPISODE ABOUT CIRCADEAN RHYTHMS AND IN TRAINMENT WELL THERE'S A CLASSIC STUDY BY ASHOFFTONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THAT'S NOW BEEN REPEATED MANY TIMES WHERE THEY HAD PEOPLE GO INTO ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE CLOCKS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE WINDOWS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE WATCHES AND THERE WERE SOMETIMES EVEN IN CONSTANT DARK OR CONSTANT LIGHT AND THEY VALUATED HOW WELL PEOPLE PERCEIVE THE PASSAGE OF TIME ON SHORTER TIME SCALES AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS REALLY INTERESTING WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE HOW LONG THEY WERE IN THESE ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT SO AFTER FORTY TWO DAYS OR SO THEY'D ASK PEOPLE HOW LONG YOU THNK YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS OR THIRTY SIX DAYS THEY GENERALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN IN THIS VERY ODD ENVIRONMENT WITH NO CLOCKS OR WATCHES OR EXPOSURE TO SUNLIGHT OR REGULAR RHYTHMS OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IN ADDITION THEY FOUND THAT THEIR PERCEPTION OF SHORTER TIME INTERVALS WAS ALSO REALLY DISRUPTED SO IF THEY ASKED THEM TO MEASURE OFF TWO MINUTES THEY NORMALLY PEOPLE ARE PRETTY GOOD AT MEASURING OFF TWO MINUTES PEOPLE WITHIN YOU KNOW FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS AT MOST AF YOU CONA TO SIT THERE IN JUST A WAY YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHEN TWO MEN IS ZUBIOU SAY TWO MENS IS UP WELL WHEN PEOPLE CIRCADEAN CLOCKS OR CIRCATIAN AN TRAINMENT I SHOULD SAY WAS DISRUPTED THEIR PERCEPTION OF TIME MEASUREMENT ON SHORTER TIME SCALES OF MINUTES ARE EVEN SECONDS WAS GREATLY DISRUPTED AND AS WELL SEE IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES GREAT PROBLEMS FOR HOW YOU CONTEND WITH WORK HOW YOU CONTEND WITH CHALLENGES OF DIFFERENT KINDS YOU WANT YOUR CIRCADEAN N TRAINMENT TO BE PRETTY LOCKED IN OR PRETTIAN TRAINED TO THE OUTSIDE LIGHT DARK CYCLE SO THAT YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME ON SHORTER TIME INTERVALS CAN BE PRECISE BECAUSE THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE TIME ACCURATELY FOR THEY GIVEN TASK OR GIVEN THING THAT YOUR ENVOLVED IN TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL WAYS THAT PREDICTS HOW WELL OR POORLY YOU PERFORM THAT THING OR TASK SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CIRCANUAL IN TRAINMENT THEY MATCHING OF THE CELLS AND TISSUES AND ORGANS OF OUR BODY TO THE THREE HUNDERED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY JOURNEY THAT THE EARTH TAKES AROUND THE SUN EACH YEAR AND WE TALKED ABOUT CIRCADEAN IN TRAINMENT THE WAY THAT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR GENETIC AND PROTINE CLOCKS OF EACH IN EVERY ONE OF OURSELVES IS MATCHED TO THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH ON ITS AXIS AND THE EXPOSURE O AR LACK OF EXPOSURE TO THE SUN BECAUSE OF THAT ROTATION ON ITS AXIS NEXT I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SO CALLED ULTRADEAN IN TRAINMENT ULTRADIAN RHYTHMS ARE RHYTHMS OF ABOUT NINETY MINUTES OR SO AND ALL OF OUR EXISTENCE IS BROKEN UP INTO THESE NINETY MINUTE ULTRADEAN CYCLES WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT BY THE NIGT YOU SLEEP SIX HOURS OR FOUR HOURS OR EIGHT HOURS OR TEN HOURS THAT ENTIRE PERIOD OF SLEEP IS BROKEN UP INTO THESE NINETY MINUTE ULTRADEAN CYCLES EARLY IN THE NIGHT YOU TEND AT MORE SLOWAVE SLEEP LATER IN THE IGHT YOUTENDON WERE RHEM SLEEP BUT NONE THE LESS YOUR SLEEP IS BROKEN UP INTO THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES HOWEVER WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO ARE GOVERNED BY THESE ULTRADEAN RHYTHMS FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE TO WORK MEANING DO MATH OR TRY AND LEARN A LANGUAGE OR DO PHYSICAL WORK OF ANY KIND OR WORK OUT THE NINETY MINUTE TIME BLOCK SEEMS TO BE THE ONE IN WHICH THE BRAIN CAN ENTER A STATE OF FOCUS AND ALERTNESS AND DO HARD WORK AND FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS AND THEN A ABOUT NINETY MINUTES THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN EUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN THIS MENTAL OR PHYSICAL WORK NOW EVERYBODY FROM YOU KNOW THE SELF HELP LITERATURE TO THE BUSINESS LITERATURE TO THE POPPSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE HAS TRIED TO LEVERAGE THESE ALTRADEIAN CYCLES BY SAYING IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING HARD AND YOU WANT A FOCUS ON IT LIMITET TO NINETY MINUTES OR LAST AND I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO IS ALSO JOING THAT CONVERSATION AND INDEED I USE NINETY MINUTE WORK CYCLE AND I THINK AH THEY ARE EXTREMELY POWERFUL A ONE SHOULD NEVER EXPECT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DROP IMMEDIATELY INTO A STATE OF HIGH FOCUS AT THE BEGINNING AND THAT ITS REMAIN THERE FOR NINETY MINUTES WE ALL YOU KNOW STRUGGLE TO VARYING DEGREES TO ACHIEVE FOCUS AND MOTIVATION AN DRIVE WITHIN THOSE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES BUT IT IS TRUE MEANING THERE IS AMPLE LITERATURE TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT AFTER ABOUT NINETY MINUTES WE TEND TO GOING TO A STATE OF LESS ABILITY TO FOCUS SO WHILE THIS ISN'T TIME PERCEPTION PER SAY IT IS AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF ENTRAINMENT WHAT ARE WE IN TRAINING TO RIGHT WHEN JUST BECAUSE WE CAN FOCUS FOR NINETY MINUTES AND THEN NOT SO WELL AT A HUNDRED MINUTES OR A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES WHAT ARE WE IN TRAINING TO WILL WHAT YOURE IN TRAINING TO IS THE RELEASE OF PARTICULAR NORCHEMICLES THIS CASE A SEETOCOLLING AN DOPOMINE THAT ALLOW YOUR BRAIN TO FOCUS FOR PARTICULAR PERIODS OF TIME NINETY MINUTES OR SO AND AFTER ABOUT NINETY MINUTES OR SO THE AMOUNT OF THOSE CHEMICALS THAT CAN BE RELEASED TENS TO DROP VERY LOW WHICH IS WIOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS BECOMES DIMINISHED IF ONE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE MORE ABOUT THE AN BACKBONE AND BASIS OF THESE ULTRADING RHYTHMS IT GOES BY DIFFERENT NAME THIS WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED THE BASIC REST ACTIVITY CYCLE AH THIS WAS PROPOSED MANY YEARS AGO BY N THANIAL CLITEMEN IT WAS ESTABLISH TO BE TRUE WITHIN SLEEP STATES AS I MENTION BEFORE THEN IT WAS DEBATED FOR A LONG TIME WHETHER OR NOT THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES ALSO CONTROLL OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND PER FORM WORK IN WAKEFUL STATES AND IE TURNS OUT THAT THEY DO NOTHERS A LOT OF LITERATURE TO SUPPORT THAT I ALWAYS GET THE QUESTION HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE NINETY MINUTE CYCLE BEGINS IN OTHER WORDS LET SAY YOU WAKE UP AT EIGHT A M AND YOU JUST FINISHED A NINETY MNUTES SLEEP CYCLES THAT MEAN THAT YOUR NEXT NINETY MINUTE CYCLE WHERE YOU COULD DO WORK BEGINS RIGHT TO AITO ONE NOW THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THESE BASIC REST ACTIVITY CYCLES THESE ALTRADING RHYTHMS IS THAT YOU CAN INITIATE THEM WHENEVER YOU WANT THIS IS NOT LIKE A CIRCATEANG RHYTHM WHICH IS A HARD WIRED UNERRING SIGNAL OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE ALTRADING RHYTHMS THAT OCCUR DURING SLEEP ARE HARD WIRED UNERRING YOU DON'T GET THE OPTION OF MAKING YOUR SLEEP CYCLES OF HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES OR FIVE MINUTES YOU DON'T GET THAT OPTION BUT IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO APPLY ALTRADIANG RHTHMS TO WORK IN PERFORMANCE YOU CAN SET A CLOCK AND DECIDE OCAE NOW THE FOCUS BEGINS NOW THE WORK BEGINS AND THIS NINETY MINUTE CYCLE IS THE PERIOD IN WHICH I'M GOING TO DO WORK AND I ACTUALLY DO THIS IIN A MIDMORNING AND SOMETIMES TWICE TO DAY I DO A NINETY MINUTE CYCLE WHERE I LIMIT ALL DISTRACTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE PUT AWAY MY PHONE OFTEN TURN AL THENE AN AS WELL I TALKE ABOUT THIS IN AN EPISODE ON OPT AN COND OF AN OPTIMAL WORK DAY AT LEAST FOR ME I JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS MIGHT WORK BUT I WANTE EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT THESE ALTRADING RHYTHMS ARE ONES THAT YOU SET SO YOU DECIDE I'M GOING TO WORK FOR NINETY MINUTES WHAT YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE HOWEVER IS THAT AT ABOUT A HUNDRED MINUTES OR A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A DIMINISHMENT IN PERFORMANCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FOCUS AS WELL AND THAT'S AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES ARE LINKED TO THE ABILITY OF THE NURANS THAT RELEASE A SEETO COLING AND DOPAMING AND TO SOME EX ENT NORUPE AND EFT FROM THET THINGS THAT GIVE US NARROW FOCUS MOTIVATION AND DRIVE THE WAY THAT THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES ARE INVOLVED IN THOSE CIRCUITS AFTER ABOUT NINETY MINUTES THOSE CIRCUITS ARE FAR LESS WILLING TO ENGAGE AND THERE FOR ITS MUCH HARDER TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS TO A HIGH DEGREE SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DO MULTIBLE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES PER DAY OF FOCUS IN THAT CASE YOU NEED TO CSEPARATE THEM OUT YOU CAN'T DO ONE NINETY MINUTE CYCLE THAN GO RIGHT INTO ANOTHER NINETY MINUTE CYCLE THAN UNDER THE NINETY MIUTE CYCLE YOU CAN'T CHEAT THESE A CIRCUITS RELATED TO A SEET OF COLING AND DOPEMING IN NORUP AN EFFEREN UNFORTUNATELY I SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE DO NO MORE THAN THREE AN IDEALLY IT WOULD BE TWO OR JUST ONE OF THESE NINETY MNUTE CYCLES WHAT I SAY IDEALLY WELL THEY ARE VERY TAXING YOU ARE IN A VERY NARROW TONNEL OF FOCUS SO FOR ME I CAN DO ONE MIDMORNING AND CAN PROBABLY DO INOTHER ONE IN THE AFTERNOON THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF WORK THAT'S LIKE CHECKING EMAL OR TEX MESSAGING OR SOCIAL MEDIA THIS IS VERY FOCUS HARD WORK A WORKING ON HARD PROBLEMS OF VARIOUS KINDS AND THIS WILL BE DIFFER FOR EVERYBODY SO I RECOMMEND THAT THEY BE SPASED BY AT LEAST TWO TO FOUR HOURS AND MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE MORE THAN TWO PER DAY THEYEARE PROBLECS A MUTINS OUT THERE THAT COULD DO THREE OR FOUR BUT THAT'S EXCEEDIN NGLY RARE I THINK EVEN ONE A DAY IS GOING TO FEEL LIKE A SIGNIFICANT MENTAL INVESTMENT AND AFTERWARDS YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL PRETTY TAXED SO NOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CIRCANUAL CIRCADIAN AND ULTRADIAN RHYTHMS BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT TIME PERCEPTION PER SAY WE'VE MAINLY TALKED ABOUT THE SUBCONSCIOUS SLOW OSCILLATORY WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE INTRAINED OR MATCH TO THE YEAR OR TO THE DAY AND THESE ALTRADIAN CYCLES THAT WE CAN IMPOSE ON OUR WORK AND THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE TOWARD MORE FOCUS IF WE LIKE WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL PERCEPTION OF TIME WHAT ACTUALLY CONTROLS HOW FAST OR HOW SLOWLY WE PERCEIVE TIME GOING BY THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE FORMS OF TIME PERCEPTION THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE AWARE OF ONE IS OUR PERCEPTION OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME IN THE PRESENT HOW QUICKLY ARE SLOWLY THINGS SEEM TO BE HAPPENING FOR US THIS IS KIND OF LIKE AN INTERVAL TIME OR TICKING OFF TIME TICTICTCTICTICTIC ITS EITHER FINE SLICING LIKE THAT OR TIC TIC TIC WE HAVE INTERVAL TIMERS I'LL DISCUSS THE BASIS OF THOSE INTERVAL TIMERS WE ALSO ENGAGIN WHAT'S CALLED PROSPECTIVE TIMING WHICH IS LIKE A STOP WATCH MEASURING OFF THINGS AS THEY GO FORWARD THAT MIGHT SOUND A LO BIT LIKE WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A LIBIT DIFFERENT FOR INSTANCE IF I TOLD YOU TO START MEASURING OFF A TWO MINUTE TIME INTERVAL INTO THE FUTURE YOU COULD DO THAT PRETTY WELL BUT IF I TOLD YOU YOU HAD TO MESURE A FIVE MINUTE TIMER INTERVAL INTO THE FUTURE AND YOU COULDN'T USE ANY CLOCKS OR WATCHES OR YOUR PHONE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SET THE TIC MARKS YOU'D HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MANY TIMES YOU WERE GIN TO COUNT OFF DURING THAT FIVE MINUTE TIME BLOCK THERE'S ALSO RETROSPECTIVE TIME WHICH IS HOW YOU MEASURE OFF TIME IN THE PAST SO IF I SAY YOU KNOW LAST WEEK I A KNOW YOU WENT TO THE PARK YOU DID SOME THINGS WITH FRIENDS YOU KNOW YOU WENT OUT IN THE EVENING O HOW LONG WAS IT BETWEEN LUNCH AN WHEN YOU WENT TO DINNER WITH FRIENDS YOU PROBABLY THINK  CE WILL I REMEMBER I WEN TO DINNER AT SEVEN AND WE HAD LUNCH RIGHT AROUND TWO YOU'RE USING MEMORY TO RECONSTRUCT CERTAIN SETS OF EVENTS IN THE PAST AND GET A SENSE OF THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONING WITHIN TIME OK WE HAVE RETROSPECTIVE CURRENT TIME INTERVAL MEASUREMENTS AND THEN PROSPECTIVE TIME MEASUREMENT INTO THE FUTURE THE BEAUTY OF TIME PERCEPTION IN THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THAT IT BOILS DOWN TO A COUPLE OF SIMPLE MOLECULES THAT GOVERN WHETHER R NOT WE ARE FINE SLICING TIME OR WHETHER NOT WE ARE BATCHING TIME IN LARGER BINS THOSE MOLECULES GO BY NAMES THAT MAY BE O'VE HEARD THINGS LIKE DOPAMING AND NOR UP IN EFFRENT NUROMODULATORS CALLED NOROMODULARS BECAUSE THEY MODULATE THEY CHANGE THE WAY THE OTHER NURL CIRCUITS WORK ALSO THINGS LIKE CERETONAN CERETONAN IS RELEASED FROM A DIFFERENT SIGHT IN THE BRAIN THAN DOPOMINA NOR AN EPINEFERAN IS AND HAS DIFFERENT EFFECT ON TIME PERCEPTION SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THINGS LIKE DOPAMINE AND CERETONAN CAN MODULATE OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME WHEN FOCUS ON A LITTLE BIT OF LITERATURE THAT NOW HAS BEEN DONE FORTUNATELY IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS AND WHICH ESSENTIALLY SHOWS THAT THE MORE DOPAMNE THAT'S RELEASED INTO OUR BRAIN THE MORE WE TEND TO OVERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS JUST PASSED THET ME REPEAT THAT THE MORE DOPAMINE THAT IS RELEASED INTO OUR BRAIN THE MORE WE TEND TO OVERESTIMATE HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE VERY STRIPE STRAIGHTFORWARD SCUSE ME AND THEIR VERY OBJECTIVE WHICH IS REALLY NICE WHICH IS YOU CAN GIVE PEOPLE OR IN ANIMAL A DRUG THAT INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE AND THEN ASK THEM TO MEASURE OFF WITHOUT ANY MEASUREMENT DEVICE LIKE A WATCHER A CLOCK WHEN ONE MINUTE HAS PASSED AS DOPAMINE LEVELS TARISE IN THE BRAIN PEOPLE TEND TO THINK THAT THE MINUTE IS UP BEFORE A MINUTE SO THEY AT THE THIRTY EIGHT SECOND MARK THO SEOCE THINK A MINT IS UP SO THEY'VE OVERESTIMATE E HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED THE HIGHER LEVEL THE DOPAMINE THE MORE PEOPLE TEND TO OVERESTIMATE NOW IT'S ALSO TRUE THEN NORE EPANEFERAN ALSO CALL NORGRENALIN PLAYS A ROLL AND ITS ROLL IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF DOPAMINE AND THAT'S BECAUSE NOREPONEPERO AND DOPAMIN AR CLOSE COUSINS AS SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED FROM ONE ANOTHER OCASO DOPAMINE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE EPAN EPFRON AND NOREPAN EFRON BY A CHEMICALLY IT'S THEY THERE'S A CASCADE IN WHICH DOPAMINE CAN BE MADE INTO NOREPAN EPFRON AN EPAN EFRN WHICH IS REMARKABLE HOW DOES HAVING ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IN NOREPANEFRAN CAUSE ONE TO OVERESTIMATE HW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED WELL IT DOES IT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT CAUSES FIND SLICING OF YOUR TIME BINS SO FIND SLICING OF TIME MENS IS LIKE INCREASING THE FRAME RATE ON YOUR CAMERA RIGHT SLOW MOTION IS ACHIEVED IN MOVIES AND ELSEWHERE BY INCREASING THE FRAME RATE SO IF YOU TAKE A MOVI AT THIRTY FRAMES PER SECOND AND WATCH IT IT WILL APPEAR TO HAVE A CERTAIN SPEED RCAUSE OS A O SNAPSHOTS THIRTY FRAMES PERSECOND IN CONTRASTS IF YOU TOOK THAT SAME MOVI AT FOUR THOUSAND FRAMES PERSECOND YOU ARE FIND SLICING INUTO SEE EVERY LITTLE DETAIL N AS YOU PLAY EACH ONE OF THOSE FRAMES IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE IT MOVED SLOWER OCEN WHATEVER IT SO THE KIND OF JUMP SHOT AN BASKEBALL THAT'S DONE SLOWLY ANY ANY SLOW MOTION IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIGHER FRAME RATE SO DOPAMINE AND NORE EPERAN EFRAN INCREASE FRAME RATE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THEY TEND TO LEAD US TO OVERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT'S PASSED CONVERSELY THE NEROMODULATOR CERATONAN CAUSES PEOPLE TO UNDERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THATS PASSED SO THEY'VE DONE THESE EXPERIMENTS THEY ACTUALLY HAVE DONE THESE EXPERIMENTS USING  INHUMANS WITH DRUGS THAT INCREASE CRATONAN THEY'VE ALSO DONE THEM WITH CANABUS WHICH INCREASES CERATONAN AMONG OTHER THINGS INCLUDING THE CANABANOID RECEPTOR ACTIVATION AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF FIVE AH T OR WHETHER NOT THEYV IGESTED CANABUS THEY TEND TO UNDER ESTIMATE HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED UDO THE EQUIVALENT EXPERIMENT YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO GUESS OR TELL YOU WHEN FIVE MINUTES FOR INSTANCE AS PASSED JUST USE FIVE MINUCEAS EXAMPLE IS TIME AND GENERALLY THEY WILL MISS THE FIVE MINUTE MARK THEY WILL THINK IF THEY'LL LET SIX MINUTES PASSANCS THEY GET AS FIVE MINUTES WHEN THEY'VE UNDER ESTIMATED HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED AND THAT'S BECAUSE CERATONAN AND SOME OF THE RELATED MOLECULES IN THE BRAIN TEND TO LEAD TO SLOWER FRAME RATES RIGHT THEY TAKE THE FRAME RATE FROM IN THE EXAMPLE I USE BEFORE FROM FOUR THOUSAND FRAMES PERCECON DOWN TO SAY TWENTY FRAMES PER SECOND SO THIS IS VERY INTERESTING IT'S INTERESTING IN TERMS OF HOW PHARMACOLOGY CAN BE USED TO ADJUST TIME PERCEPTION BUT IT'S ALSO INTERESTING IN TE CONTECT OF THAT CRCADIAN RHYTHM THERE SOME EMERGING EVIDENCE THAT THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE THERE ARE ROBUST CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMI NOR UPIN EFRAN AND SERATONAN THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE BRAIN AND BLOOD STREAM AN BODY DEPENDING ON TIME OF DAY WITHIN THE CIRCADIAN CYCLE NOW I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DURING SLEEP DURING SLEEP THERE ARE DEFINITELY VARIATIONS AND THINGS LIKE DOPOMI NOR EPIN EFRANAN CERATONA I TALKED ABOUT THEM THE EPISODES ON SLEEP HEREON JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ROLL OF THESE MOLECULES IN TIME PERCEPTION DURING WAKEFULNESS SO MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE POINTS TOF THE FACT THAT IN THE FIRST TALF OF THE DAY APPROXIMATE FOR SALF OF THE DAY DOPAMY IN THE NOREP AND EFRAN ARE ELEVATED IN THE BRAIN BODY AN BLOOD STREAM MUCH MORE THEN IS CERATONAN AND THAT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY AND I PARTICULAR TOWARDS EVENING IN NIGHTTIME CERATONAN LEVELS ARE GOING UP I THINK THAT'S FAIRLY WELL ESTABLISH NOW WHAT THAT MEANS BASED ON WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED ABOUT THE ROLE OF DOPOMI NOR EPINEFRNAN CERETONAN IN SETTING THE FRAME RATE OF TIME PERCEPTION IS THAT OUR PERCEPTION OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY AND IN THE LA LATTER HALF OF THE DAY AND THERE STARTING TO BE SOME EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS THAT EARLY IN THE DAY PEOPLE TEND TO OVERESTIMATE HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED AND LATER IN THE DAY THEY TEN TO UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASS AND THIS IS INDEPENDENT OF TAKING ANY KIND OF SUBSTANCE THAT WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE DOPAMENOR CERATONAN NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF HOW ONE THINKS ABOUT STRUCTURING THEIR DAY BECAUSE I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS TASKS THAT THEY NEED TO DO THROUGHOUT THEIR DAY MANY OR I SHOULD SAY ALL OF THE LITERATURE AT LEAST THAT I CAN FIND ON PRODUCTIVITY AND THINGSO THAT SORT POINT TO THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THE HARDEST TASK THE THING THAT WE WANT TO DO THE LEAST OR THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK EARLY IN THE DAY AS A KIND OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOL FORGET ING AT DONE AND FEELING IS IF WE ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING AND I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT PROTOCOL FRANKLY BUT I 'M NOT SURE IT'S AN EXCELLENT PROTOCAL BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE SENSE ACCOMPLISHMENT OR AT LEAST IT'S NOT ONLY AN EXCELLENT PROTOCOL BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE SENDS ACCOMPLISHMENT BANOTHER REASON TO MOVE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HARD INTO THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY IS THAT IF INDEED THE DOPOMANERGIC AND NORATRENERGIC CIRCUITS ARE MORE ACTIVE IT AT THAT TIME WE ARE ACTUALLY IN A BETTER POSITION COGNITIVELY TO PARSE THAT HARD PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO FIND SLICE OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME AND FIND SLICE ALL THE PERCEPTIAL EVENTS OUTSIDE US SOWHAT IAM REALLY SAYING IS THAT EARLY IN THE DAY YOU ARE A MUCH MORE HIGH RESOLUTION CAMERA SO TO SPEAK THAN YOU ARE LATER IN THE DAY NOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF TASK AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS REQUIRE DIFFERENT FRAME RATES OR DIFFERENT WAYS OF PERCEIVING TIME AND INDEED THIS ALSO LENDS ITSELF TO A TOOL WHEREBY FOR ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE MORE KIND OF CREATIVE THINKING THAT AREN'T AS CONSTRAINED BY PARTICULAR ANSWERS OR OUTCOMES AND IN WHICH WE NEED TO KIND OF BLEND DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR MEMORY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF TASK UTALIZATION IN OTHER WORDS FOR CREATIVE WORKS FOR BRAIN STORMING FOR THINGS THAT ARE A BIT MORE FLUID SO TO SPEAK THE MORE CERATONERGIC SECOND HALF OF THE DAY AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SERATONERGIC SECOND HALF THE DAY LENDS ITSELF TO ARE TIME PERCEPTION MAY ACTUALLY BE MORE BENEFICIAL FOR THOSE SORTS OF TASK AND I'LL PUT A REFERENCE TO A COUPLE THE STUDIES THAT POINT TO THIS IDEA THAT IN THESE HIGHER DOPAMANERGIC STATES WE ARE BETTER AT DOING CERTAIN SORTS OF TASKS AND IN THESE MORE SCERETONERGIC STATES WERE BETTER IT DOING OTHER SORTS OF TASK AND HOW THE DOPOMINE TENDS TO BE EARLIER IN THE DAY AND THE SARTONAN LATER IN THE DAY SO TO SPEAK THESE ARE BROUGHD A PAINTING WITH BROAGD STROKES HERE BUT I THINK THESE LEND THEMSELVES TO SOME REALLY EXCELLENT TOOLS ECAUSE I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF DOING SOMETHING THAT'S HARD OR CHALLENGING EARLY IN THE DAY BUT WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES HARDER CHALLENGING HOW WHAT DOES THAT TASK ACTUALLY REALLY REQUIRE IN TERMS OF TIME PERCEPTION SOME PEOPLE MIGHT APPRECIATE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS MIGHT WORK BASICALLY WHAT I AM SAYING IS IF YOU ARE DOING WORK THAT INVOLVES ADHERING TO SOME RIGID RULES SO MATH OR A RECIPE OR EXECUTION OF MUSICAL SCALES OR PHYSICAL SKILLS OR A COUNTING OR SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF PRECISION WHERE THERE'S A RIGHT AND WRONG ANSWER AND IT'S HARD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU DO THAT IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT DOPOMINE E NORAPAN EFEREN IMPAT TIME PERCEPTION YOU ARE LITERALLY BETTER AT SLICING UP TIME YOU ARE A HIGHER RESOLUTION BRAIN DURING THOSE TIMES AND SO THAT'S GOING TO LEND ITSELF BETTER TO A VENTS AND DEMANDS THAT REQUIRE HIGH RESOLUTION WHEREAS IN THE AFTERNOON IN THIS MORE WHAT IAM CALLING SERETONRGIC STATE THAT'S WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE BETTER R AT BRAIN STORMING AND CREATIVE WORKS WHERE THERE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW YOUR BASCHING TIME IN PERCEIVING TIME AND THERE ISN'T SO MUCH RIGID OVERSIGHT OF A RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER AND AS AN ASIDE TO SUPPORT WHAT I SAID BUT ALSO TO TAKE US BACK TO THIS CRITICAL ROLE OF THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT WHEN ONE'S SLEEP IS DESRUPTED WHEN SLEEP IS EITHER TOO SHORT OR IS FRAGMENTED OR IS NOT OF HIGH ENOUGH QUALITY FOR ENOUGH DAYS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THERE IS A DISREGULATION OF THESE DOPOMANURGIC NORAGENER GIC AND CERETONURGIC STATES THROUGHOUT THE DAY THEY GET KIND OF O MISHMASHED UP OM IT'S NOT THAT THERARE TOTAL MESS BUT THEY ARENT AS CLEANLY DEFINED ND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHEN WE HAVEN'T SLEPT WELL OR WE HAVEN'T SLEPT ENOUGH WE TEND TO FEEL LITTLE OFF LIKE WE CAN'T CONCENTRATE PART OF THAT LACK OF CONCENTRATION IS DUE TO OTHER THINGS BUT PART OF THAT CONCENTRATION COULD BE DUE THE FACK THAT OUR SENSE OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS DESRUPTED SO THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME VALUE IN KEEPING THE DOPOMENURGIC NORAGERNERGIC STATE CAN E LIMITED TO THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY AND THE CERTONURGIC STATE AS RECALLING IT AN A PUSH TOWARDS THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY NOW THERE IS AVERSION OF HOW DOPAMINE AND NORAP IN EFREN CAN IMPACT OUR PERCEPTION OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME IN WAYS THAT CAN BE VERY DESRUPTIVE OR EVEN MALEDAPTIVE AND THE BEST EXAMPLE THAT I AM AWARE OF IS TRMA MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN CAR ACCIDENTS OR WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME OTHER FORM OF MAJOR TRAMA DO WHAT'S CALLED OVERCLOCKING OVERCLOCKING IS WHEN LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AND NORAP IN EFREN INCREASE SO MUCH DURING A PARTICULAR EVENT OUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS IS INCREASED SO MUCH DURING A GIVEN EVENT THAT WE FIND SLICE IN OTHER WORDS THE FRAME RATE IS INCREASE SO MUCH SO THAT WE PERCEIVE THINGS AS HAPPENING IN ULTRASLOW MOTION NOW THAT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A BAD THING OVER ALL BUT THE PROBLEM WITH OVERCLOCKING IS THE WAY IN WHICH THAT INFORMATION GETS STAMPED DOWN INTO THE MEMORY SYSTEM SO THE MEMORY SYSTEM WHICH INVOLVES ERE IS THE BRAIN LIKE THE HIPPICAMPIS BUT ALSO THE NEW QUARTEC IS BASICALLY A SPACE TIME RECORDER WHEN I MEAN BY SPACE TIME RECORDER WELL YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM OF COURSE IS HOUSED IN THE A DARKNESS OF YOUR SKULL IT DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD EXCEPT LIGHT COMING IN THROUGH THE EYES AND WHATEVER HAPPENS TO HIT OUR EARS AND ON TERMS OF SOUNDWAVES AND AND SKINANS AND SO FORTH SO AS TO TAKE ALL THOSE NEURAL SIGNALS AND IT HAS TO CREATE A RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED NOW T DOESN'T CREATE A RECORD OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPEN BUT CAR ACCIDENTS AND TRAMA AN THINGS OF THAT SORT OFTENTIMES ARE STAMPED DOWN INTO OUR RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT GET STAMPED DOWN WHAT WE ACTUALLY MEAN BY THE PHRASE STAMP DOWN IS THAT THE PRECISE FIRING OF THE SEQUENCE OF NURONS THAT REFLECTED SOME EVENT SO LETS SAY I'M IN A CAR ACCIDENT CERTAIN NURANS ARE FIRING BECAUSE OF THE FLIPPING OF THE CAR OR THEIR SCREAMS ORE THERE'S BLOOD OR NO THINKS OF THAT SORT ALL OF THAT NURAL ACTIVITY GETS REPEATED IN THE HYPPICAMPUS AND THEND THE SEQUENCE OF THE FIRING OF THOSE NURANS IS ALSO REMEMBERED SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT NURAN ONE TO THREE FOR FIRED IN THAT SEQUENCE IT'S ALSO THAN NURE ON ONE TO THREE FOR FIRED AT A PARTICULAR RATE SO WOULD BE ONE TO THREE FOR DURING THE ACTUAL EVENT AND THEN THE MEMORY IS STORED AS FIRING OF THOSE NURANS AS ONE TO THREE FOUR RIGHT IF IT IF DURING THE EVENT IT WAS ONE TO THREE FOR AT THAT RATE THE STORAGE OF THE MEMORY IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE TO THREE FOUR OKE IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S BOTH A SPACE CODE AS WE SAY MEANING THE PARTICULAR NURANS THAT FIRE IS IMPORTANT AND THERE'S A RATE CODE HOW QUICKLY THOSE NURANS FIRE OR THE RELATIVE FIRING THE TIMING OF THE FIRING THOSE NURANS IS ALSO PART OF THE MEMORY THIS AFFORDS OUR MEMORY SYSTEM TREMENDOUS FLEXIBILITY WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE SAME SET OF NURANS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND STAMP DOWN MANY MANY MORE MEMORIES BECAUSE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS USE A MATCH OF THE DIFFERENT RATES OF THE DFERENT NURANS THAT WERE FIRING IN ORDER TO SET THAT CODE RIGHT YOU DON'T OTHERWISE IF YOU NEEDED A DIFFERENT SET OF NURANS FOR EVERY MEMORY YOU NEED ANY ENORMOUS HYPPICAMPAGN ENORMOUS HEAD SO I THINK I THINK YOU GET THE BASIC IDEA OVERCLOCKING IS A CASE IN WHICH THE FRAMORYTE IS SO HIGH THAT A MEMORY GETS STAMP DOWN AND PEOPLE HAVE A VERY HARD TIME SHAKING THAT MEMORY AN THE EMOTIONS ASSOCIATE WITH THAT MEMORY AND IT'S NOT THE TOPIC OF TO DAY'S CONVERSATION BUT WE WILL COVER TRAMA IN A FUTURE EPISODE IN DETAIL BUT MANY OF THE TREATMENTS FOR TRAMA E M D ARE NOWADAYS THERE 'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ALSO ABOUT KEDEMINE THERAPIES A EXPOSURE THERAPIES OM YOU KNOW LIKE COGNATE BEHAVIORAL THERAPIECS INVOLVED NOT JUST TRYING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF EMOTION ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEMORY BUT ALSO A SA DELIBERATE SPEEDING UP OR SLOWING DOWN OF THAT MEMORY IN OTHER WORDS TRYING TO ALLOW THE PERSON WHO EXPERIENCE THE TRAMA TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE RATE OF THE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR MEMORY NOT JUST WHETHER NOT THE MEMORY HAPPENED AT ALL IN FACT INOW ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT TRAMA VICTIMS LEARN IS THAT THEY AREN'T GOING TO FORGET WHAT HAPPEN WHAT'S EVENTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN IDEALLY WITH GOOD TREATMENT IS THAT THE EMOTIONAL WEIGTE OF THE EXPERIENCE WILL EVENTS SHALLY BE DIVORCED FROM THE MEMORY OF THE EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S DONE AGAIN BY TRYING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF EMOTIONAL ACTIVATION DURING THE RECALL OF THAT EXPERIENCE AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO ALTER THE RATE OF THE MEMORY PLAYBACK IN OTHER WORDS TAKING THAT FIRING OF NURANS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEND ONE TO THREE FOUR AGAIN IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED BUT ONE TO TH REFOR FOR THE CAR CRASH AND GETTING THE MEMORY TO PLAY BACK AT A RATE OF ONE TO THREE FOUR OR EVEN ONE TO THREE FOUR ONE TO THREE FOR IN OTHER WORDS ALLOWING THE PERSON OR INSTRUCTING THE PERSON TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE RATE OF THE PLAYBACK AND IN THAT WAY THERE SEEMS TO BE STILL YET UNKNOWN MECHANISM BY WHICH PEOPLE CAN UNCOUPLE SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL WEIGHT THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THAT MEMORY SO OVERCLOCKING IS A KIND OF EXTREME EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE DOPAMANURGENT AN THE NORAGENERIC SYSTEM IS RAMPED UP SO HIGH THAT PEOPLE HAVE THIS UNFORTUNATELY WHAT SEEMS LIKE INDELIBLE MARK IN THEIR BRAIN OF A PARTICULAR EVENT BUT AGAIN TROMA TREATMENT IS DESIGN TO UNCOUPLE THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF THAT EVENT SOME OF YOU R PROBABLY SAYING WHY DOPAMINE DURING TRAMA I THOUGHT DOPAMINE WAS THE FEEL GOOD MOLECULE WELL A IN REALITY DOPAMINE IS NOT NECESSARILY A MOLECULE REWARDETS A MOLECULE OF MOTIVATION PURSUIT AND DRIVE AND BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOPAMINE AND NORUP AN EFFRAN OFTENTIMES THEY ARE CO RELEASED SO WHETHER NOT DOPAMING IS RELEASED DURING CARCRASHES OR OTHER FORMS OF TRAMA WE DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT BOTH THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM THE NORAGENERGIC SYSTEM WHEN WE SAY NORAGENERGIC WE ENORUP AN EFRAN THOSE SYSTEMS ARE GREATLY INCREASED ANY TIME THERE'S A HEIGHTENED STATE OF AROUSAL AND AROUSAL CAN HAVE NEGATIVE VEILANCE LIKE A MEANING ASSOCIATED WITH AN EVENT THAT WE REALLY HATE THAT WE PREFER NOT TO BE OF MOLVEDEN ORGAN HAVE POSITIVE VAILANCE BUT DOPAMING THE NOROP AND EFRONAR CAND OF THE COMMON HOLLMARK OF ALL THINGS OF ELEVATED AROUSAL AND SO THAT'S WHY WE SEE EVIDENCE FOR DOPAMINE BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CHANGES IN TIME PERCEPTION BOTH FOR POSITIVE EVENTE AND FOR NEGATIVE EVENTS THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AROUSAL DOPAMINE TIME PERCEPTION AND BLINKING AND THIS IS ALL SUPPORTED BY A REALLY INTERESTING PAPER FIRST AUTHOR TERAHOON AS THE LAST NAME T R E CU ANIS PUBLISHING CERNBIOLOGY SEL PRESTORNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THE TITLE OF THE PAPERS TIME DILATES AFTER SPONTANEOUS BLINKING SO HEIGHTEN STATES OF AROUSAL OR ASSOCIATE WITH HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF DOPAMING YOU NOW KNOW THAT DOPAMINE LEADS TO A KIND OF FINE SLICING OF TIME AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE FINE SLICE TIME IS BY BLINKING NOW WE THINK OF BLINKING IS JUST A THING TO LIKE LUBRICATE OUR EYES OR TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF LIKE COMING INTO OUR EYES BUT IT'S A SHUDDER ON OUR EXPERIENTS SO MUCH OF TE INFORMATION THAT COMING INTO THE BRAIN THROUGH OUR EYES IMPACTS OUR ATTENTION I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST THAT COGNIVATTENTION FOLLOWS VISUAL ATTENTION LEAST FRECITED INDIVIDUALS WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT DOPAMNE AND INCREASES IN DOPAMINE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN SPONTANEOUS BLINK RATE SO THE MORE ROUSED WE ARE THE MORE WEKE WE ARE THEIR NUMBER OF EFFECTS PEOPILS DILATE HEART RATE INCREASES ET CETERA BUT ALSO BLINKRATE INCREASES AND EVERY TIME WE BLINK THIS STUDYH CLEANLY SHOWS WE SHIFT OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME LEADING TO AS I MENTION BEFORE OVERESTIMATIONS OF TIME SO IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IN SOME WAY BLINK RATE IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO FRAME RATE ANSOLICIS VERY VERY INTERESTING AND THE WAY THAT YOU COULD THINK ABOUT LEVERAGING THIS WOULD BE IF YOU WANTED TO ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME YOU WOULD BLINK LESS AND IF YOU WANT TO SPEED UP YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME YOU WOULD BLINK MORE NOW YOU'D HAVE TO THINK OF A SYNAREON WHICH THAT WOULD BE USEFUL TO YOU A OBVIOUS OF YOUR CONBLINK YOUR GEN A MISSTHINGS AS WELL BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY INTERESTING PERAMETER OF OUR VISUAL ATTENTION AS IT RELATES TO TIME PERCEPTION BECAUSE WHAT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO IS THAT THESE NEUROMODULATORS LIKE DOPAMIN OUR SERATONEAND THAT AT JUST FRAME RATE THEY'RE NOT DOING IT THROUGH SOME MAGICAL MECHANISM IN FACT THERE'S NO SINGLE BRAIN AREA THAT WE CAN SAY CONTROLS TIME PERCEPTION I HAVEN'T SAID TODAY OH YOU KNOW IT'S THE STRIATUM WHAT INVOLVES TA STRIAUM BUT I'M NOT IN A SAY FOR INSTANCE OH IT'S THE CARABELLUM THE CARABELLUM IS DEFINITELY INVOLVED IN TIMING OF MOVEMENT SOMETHING FOR A FUTURE PODCAST BUT TIME PERCEPTION IS WHAT WE CALL A DISTRIBUTED PHENOMENON IT I'S A NETWORK OF AREAS IN THE BRAIN WORKING TOGETHER BUT DOPAMINE IN THE WAY THAT IT RELATES TO THE SHUDDERING OF YOUR EYES SEEMS TO BE CONTROLLING THE FRAME RATE ON YOUR EXPERIENCE NUMEROUS TIMES ON THIS PODCAST I'VE TALKED ABOUT COLD EXPOSURE AND NOW DAYS THEREIS A LOT OF INTEREST IN THINGS LIKE COLD SHOWERS ICE BATHS SUBMERSION IN A COLD WATER TANKS AND IN A LAKES AND OCEANS AND THINGS THAT SORT THERE ARE LOT OF DIFFERENT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF COLD EXPOSURE PROVIDEDS DONE PROPERLY CAN LEA TO INCREASESM MATABOLISM BROWN FAT STORES WHICH ARE THE GOOD FAT STORES THAT YOU WANT THIS ARE LIKE A FURNACE TO HEAT AS ALLOW YOU TO HEAT YOURSELF UPSTAY WARMING COLD A ENVIRONMENTS A TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION TO INCREASE RESILIENCE AND SO FORTH THERE'S A STUDY PUBLISH IN THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY SHOWING THAT COLD EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE ARE BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ROBUSTLY TWO POINT FIVE ACTS AND IT'S A LONG LASTING INCREASE IN DOPAMINE AND APPEARS TO BE A HEALTHY ONE MEANING DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ADDICTIVE I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME BEBLOUT THEIR ADDICTO D ICE BASBOT YOU WHON YOU THINK ABOUT THE RANGE OF A DOPAMINE INDUSING BEHAVIORS THAT ARE ADDICTIVE THAT SEEMS TO BE MORE ON THE HALTH PROMOTING SIDE WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT BECAUSE COLD WATER EXPOSURE INCREASES DOPAMINE IT WILL ALSO CHANGE YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME AND IF YOU'VE EVER DONE ONE THESE COLD WATER EXPOSURES YOU'VE EXPERIENCE THIS YOU'VE EXPERIENCE GETTING IN AND FEELING LIKE WELL MAKING IT THREE MINUTES IS A REALLY REALLY LONG TIME AND YOU ARE FINE SLICING TIME YOUR FRAME RATE IS GOING UP PART OF THAT JUST AT A KIND OF A A COURSE LEVEL AS YOUARE THINKING THIS IS PAINFUL I DON'T LIKE THIS I WANT TO GET OUT RIGHT BUT PART OF IT IS ALSO THAT YOUR DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE GOING UP VERY QUICKLY AND THEREFORE YOUR PERCEPTION OF THAT DISCOMFORT IS ALSO BEING FINE SLICE AND SO YOU COULD A LEVERGEATOOL FOR INSTANCE WHERE YOU TRYAND IN TRAIN YOUR THINKING TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN YOUR IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE RIGHT THIS IS A A KIND OF A CONTROVERSY IF YOU WILL IN THE COLD EXPOSURE WORLD THE QUESTION IS DOU TRYING LEAN INTO THE EXPERIENCE AND REALLY FEEL IT OR DO YOU TRYING DISTRACT YOURSELF YOU KNOW SING A SONG OR COUNT OFF OF YOU KNOW A FROM ONE TO A HUNDRED JUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER TACTIC YOU USE TO GET THROUGH THE COLD EXPOSURE THAT THE DOPAMING LEVEL THAT'S NOW INCREASED IN YOUR SYSTEM IS GOING TO CAUSE YOU TO FINE SLICE OR EXPERIENCE THAT AT SLOW MOTIONS SO A MINUTE IS GOING TO SEEM LIKE A LOT LONGER THAN A MINUTE IN REALITY SO YOU COULD FOR INCETANCE DECIDE TO PAY ATTENTION TO SOME EXTERNAL CUE MAYBE IT'S A AA METRONOM THAT TAKES ONCE EVERY TEN SECONDS YOU COULD DECIDE TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE YOU COULD DECIDE TO SING A SONG IN YOUR HEAD OR SING THE SONG OUT LOUD ALL OF THAT WILL DIVORCE YOU FROM THE SENSATION THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE SOMEWHAT BUT MORE SO IT WILL DIVORCE YOU FROM THE PERCEPTION OF YOUR EXPERIENCE AS GOVERNED BY THAT DOPAMINE INCREASE IN FRAME RATE IF THAT HASN'T CLEAR JUST KNOW THIS WHEN YOURE IN THE ICE BATH YOUR DOPAMY LEVELS ARE HIGH WHEN YOUR DOPAMEN LEVELS ARE HIGH YOURE EXPERIENCE OF THE DISCOMFORT THAT ICE BATH IS AT HIGHER RESOLUTION NOW UP UNTIL NOW IHAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW DOPAMINE AND TO SOME EX SENS CERETONEN CAN DIFFERENTIALLY IMPACT YOUR PERCEPTION OF HOW FAST OR HOW SLOWLY THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THE MOMENT BUT REMEMBER WE HAVE PROSPECTIVE TIME WE HAVE OUR EXPERIENCE OF TIME IN THE MOMENT AND WE HAVE RETROSPECTIVE TIME AND THER BEAUTIFUL STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWED THAT THE DOPAMINERGE EX STATE CHANGES THE WAY NOT JUST THAT WE EXPERIENCE THINGS NOW BUT THAT IT CHANGES THE WAY IN WHICH WE REMEMBER THINGS IN THE PAST AND THE RATE AT WHICH THOSE THINGS OCCURRED AND THOSE ARE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO TO MAKE THIS VERY SIMPLE IF SOMETHING THAT YOU EXPERIENTE IS FUN OR VERIED MEANING HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS IN IT AND IS IT IN OTHER WORDS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN DOPAMINE IN YOUR BRAIN YOU WILL EXPERIENCING EXPERIENCE THAT AS DOING BY VERY FAST NOW THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ICE BATH WHICH I JUST SAID YOU EXPERIENCE IS GOING BY VERY SLOWLY BUT HERE IOM TALKINGABOUT SOMETHING THATS FUN AND VERY THAT YOU REALLY LIKE ND YOU EEL LIKE IT GOES BY VERY VERY FAST IMAGINE AN AMAZING DAY FOR A KID AMUSEMENT PART THEN YOU DO A TON OF THINGS THAT'S ALL NEW THE VERY EXCITED AND HY'LLFEEL LIKE IT GOES BY VERY FAST BUT LATER THEY WILL REMEMBER THAT EXPERIENCE AS BEING VERY LONG THAT IT WAS A LONG DAY FULL OF MANY MANY EVENTS AND SO THERE'S THIS PARADOXICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOW WOU PERCEIVE FUN EXCITING VERIED EVENTS IN THE PRESENT AND HOW WE REMEMBER THEM IN THE PAST FOR THOSE OF YOU GONE ON VACATION YOU HAD AN AMAZING DAY ON VACATION IT'LL SEEM LIKE OR AN AMAZING VACATION OVER ALL IT WILL SEEM LIKE IT GOES BY VERY FAST THE LAST DAY OF VACATIONS ORE GEWOW IT WENT BY SO FAST AS THERE SO MUCH HAPPENING BUT IN MEMORY SIXTO EIGHT MONTHS LATER YOU REMEMBER WELL THAT THAT JUST WHEN YOU KNOW THAT WAS A LONG LO ONG THING WE HAD THIS THAN WE HAD THAT THAN WE DID THIS THAN WE HAD THAT INTENDS TO SPOOL OUT IN A LONGER MEMORY THAN THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE CONVERSELY IF YOU ARE BORED WITH SOMETHING OR IT SOMETHING YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE IT'S GOING TO SEEM LIKE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GO THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE MOMENT BUT WRETTORACTIVELY LOOKING BACK ITW'LL SEM LIKE THAT MOMENT WAS VERY SHORT SOIFTHE OTHER DAY I WAS WAITING IN THE WAITING ROOM FOR THE DENTIS IIS PRETTY BORING I WASISNA SITTING THERE THERE WASN'T MUCH GOING ON AND IT DID SEEM LIKE YOT WAS GOING ON AN AWFULLY LONG TIME BUT INDEED LOOKING BACK IT TO SEEMS LIKE OK SAT IN THE I SAT IN THAT ROOM NOT MUCH HAPPENE IN SO IT SEMS LIKE A VERY SHORT TIME BEEN THIS SEEMS TO BE AN EFFICIENCY OF HOW THE BRAIN STORES INFORMATION DOPA MEN BEING ASSOCIATED OF COURSE WITH FUN AND VARIED EXPERIENCES AND LOW DOPEMING BEING ASSOCIATED WITH KIND OF EMPTY BORING OR OR WHAT AT THE TIME SEEM LIKE LONG EXEXPERIENCES AND THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN STAMPED DOWN INTO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE BY THOSE EARLIER EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY TAKE HUMAN BEINGS AND ISOLATE THEM IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS YOU NOW TAKE AWAY ALL THE CLOCKS AND WATCHES AND CUES AND ABOUT WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS N WHAT TIME OF NIGHT IT IS AND A LOW PEOPLE TO HAVE A LIFE OF WHERE THEY CAN EITHER READ AND WORK AND DO THINGS OR WERE TEY HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO WHEN PEOPLE ARE ISOLATED IN VERY BORING ENVIRONMENTS AND THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TIME CUES TIME DILATES THEY TEND TO ASSUME THAT TIME HAS GONE ON VERY VERY LONG AND SO THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS WE AREN'T JUST DRIVEN BY THE CIRCADIAN CLOCKS AND THE SIRCANUAL CLOCKS AND THESE ALL TRADING CLOCKS WE ARE DRIVEN BY THESE TIMERS THAT VERY DEPENDING ON OUR LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT AND THEY VERY ON DEPENDING ON OUR LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT BECAUSE OF THESE NEUROMODULATORS DOPOMING IN SER ATONEMENTS THE WAY I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU HAVE TWO CLOCKS TWO STOP WATCHES ONE IS A DOPAMANURGIC STOP WATCH THAT FIND SLICES REALLY CLOSELY IS LIKE COUNTS OFF MILLY SECONDS AND IT'S GRABBING A MOVY OF YOUR EXPERIENCE AT VERY HIGH RESOLUTION AND IN THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE A A STOP WATCH THAT'S GATHERING BIG TIME BEENS BIG TICKS ALONG THE THE  YOU O THAT THE HAND IS MOVING AT BIGGER INTERVALS THEA MARKING OFF TIME AND DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOUR EXCITED OR WHETHER NOT YOUR BORED YOUR USING DIFFERENT STOP WATCHES ON TIME AND THEREFORE YOUR PERCEIVING YOUR EXPERIENCE DIFFERENTLY ONE VERY INTERESTING ASPECT TO THE WAY THAT NEUROMODULATORS LIKE DOPOMINE AND NOVELTY INTERACT WITH TIME PERCEPTION AND MEMORY IS HOW WE PERCEIVE OUR RELATIONSHIP TO PLACES AND PEOPLE SO REALLY INTERESTING LITERATURE SHOWING THAT THE MORE NOVEL EXPERIENCES WE HAVE IN A PLACE THE MORE WE FEEL WE KNOW THAT PLACE OBVIOUSLY BUT THE LONGER WE FEEL WE'VE BEEN THERE SO HERE'S THE KIND OF GODDUNKAN OR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAT ILLUSTRATES OF WHAT'S IN THE LITERATURE LET SAY I WORD TO MOVE IN YOUR CITY I HAPPEN TO REALLY LIKE NEW YORK CITY HAVE NEVER LIVED THERE BUT LET SAY I LIVED THERE I I LIVED IN AN GIVEN APARTMENT O FOR A YEAR AND I WON'T HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT A EXPERIENCES AND THIS MENTAL EXPERIMENT LET SAY I HAD A HUNDRED I DIFFERENT EXCITING IN NEW EXPERIENCES I WOULD AT THE END OF THAT YEAR FEEL AS IF I LIVED THERE A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME ONE YEAR I WOULD ACHALLY KNOW I LIVE THERE ONE YEAR IF HOWEVER I LIVED IN THREE DIFFERENT PLACES IN NEW YORK CITY AND I MET THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE AND I HAD THREE TIMES AS MANY NOVEL EXPERIENCES I WOULD ACTUALLY FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN THERE MUCH LONGER THEN HAD I ONLY LIVED IN ONE LOCATION THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WHEN WE MOVE TO MULTIPLE OR SEVERAL NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS WITH SOMEBODY ELSE WE TEND TO FEEL AS IF WE KNOW THAT PERSON MUCH BETTER AND THAT THEY KNOW US MUCH BETTER NOW OF COURSE WE GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH THOSE PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT CONTACTS THAND SO INDEED WE DO GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THEM FOR INCES AT THE COFFEE SHOP HOW THEY ORDER COFFEE YOU MAY BE AT THE GO TO A SPORTS EVENT HOW THEY ACT THERE MAYBE HOW THEY INTRACT WITH YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE GETTING A A SENSE OF THEM IN DIFFERENT CONTACTS THAT'S A CERTAINLY PLAYING A ROLE BUT IT SEEMS IF THE MORE NOVELTY YOU EXPERIENCE WITH SOMEBODY NOT ONLY THE MORE FAMILIAR THEY ARE TO BUT THE MORE TIME YOU FEEL YOU'VE SPENT WITH THEM EVEN THIUGH THE TOTAL AHOUNT OF TIME CAN BE EXACTLY THE SAME AND SO THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING ASPECT OF HOW OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME AN THESE NEROMODULATORS AND NOVELTY CAN SHAPE THE WAY NOXIOUS THAT WE PERCEIVE I GIVE IN EVENT IN OUR WORLD BUT HOW WE RELATE TO A PLACE OR RELATE TO A PERSON SO WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT NURCHEMICALS AND HOW THOSE NORCHEMICALS CAN INFLUENCE ARE PERCEPTION OF TIME WE HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE NURL CIRCUITS AND THE VARIOUS AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT UNDERLIE THIS I DO ONE O TOUCH ON THAT BY HIGH LIGHTING A REALLY WONDERFUL STUDY THIS WAS A STUDY PUBLISH IN NURON ALSO A SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THE TITLE THE PAPER IS BEHAVIORL PHYSIOLOGICAL AND NURL SIGNATURES OF SURPRISE DURING NATURALISTIC SPORTS VIEWING THIS EXPERIMENT HIS REALLY QUALLD THEY DID BRAIN IMAGING ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WATCHING BASKABALL GAMES THESE WERE BASKABALE GAMES THE ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE THAT WERE RECORDED AND TESUBJECTS WATCHING THESE BASKABALE GAMES IN SOME CASES NOT ALL HAD SOME INTEREST IN WHO WOULD WIN OR LOSE AND IN SOME CASES NOT ALL THE SUBJECTS IN THESE STUDIES HAD SOME PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH TEAM THEY THOUGHT WAS BETTER WHICH TEAM WAS LIKELY TO WIN ARE NOT LIKELY TO WIN THE BASIC FINDINGS OF THE STUDY WERE THAT THEY COULD MEASURE SURPRISE BI THE RELEASE OF DOPOMINE IN TWO AREAS OF THE BRAIN PART OF WHAT ARE CALLED IS CALLED EXCUSES ME THE MESO LIMBIC REWARD PATHWAY SO THE TWO ARIS OF THE BRAIN THAT R IMPORTNT HERAR THE NUCLIOUS ACUMBENS AND THE VITIER THE VENTURALTEGMENTALAREA THESE ARE AREAS THAT RELEASED JOPEMEN AS KIND OF A TOKEN OF REWARD ANY TIME SOMETHING IS SURPRISING OR A POSITIVE EXPECTATION IS MET OKE SO IF I PREDI CT THAT MY TEAM DRIBBLING DOWN COURT IS GOING TO SCORE ON THIS DRIVE AND THEY GET THE BALL IN THE BASKET LOBIT OF DOPAMIN IS RELEASED THESE TWO BRAINAREAS LIGHT UP IN THE FUNCTIONAL IMAGING A SO CALLED EPHEM OR I FUNCA FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONENCE IMAGING THAT THEY USED IN THE STUDY WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS STUDY IS NOT JUST THAT DOPAMINS RELEASED ANY TIME THAT SOMETHING THE SUBJECT WANTED TO SEE HAPPEN RIGHT ANY TIME THEY WANT TO SEE THEIR TEAM SCORE THEY SCORED BUT ALSO DURING SURPRISE SO IF THEY THOUGHT FOR INSTANCE AND THEY WOULD A HIT A BUTTON TO PREDICT THAT THEIR TEAM WAS GOING TO SCORE ON THIS PARTICULAR DRIVE AND THEY DIDN'T WELL THEN DOPAMINE COULD ALSO BE RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO THAT SURPRISE SO THIS SPEAKS AGAIN TO DOPAMING BEING SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT NOTCIOUS FOR POSITIVE EVENTS BUT FOR UNEXPECTED EVENTS NOW THAT'S ALL VERY INTERESTING AND SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT DOPAMINE IS A KIND OF FLEXIBLE CURRENCY IN THE BRAIN IT'S DOLED OUT IF YOU WILL OR RELEASED WHEN SOMETHING THAT ONE HOPES WILL HAPPEN HAPPENS AND IT'S RELEASED WHEN THERE'S A SURPRISE EVEN IF IT'S A KIND OF A NEGATIVE SURPRISES NOT SOMETHING THATTHE SUBJECT WANTED TO HAPPEN BUT THE MORE INTERESTING THING IS HOW THAT RELATES TO TIME PERCEPTION WHAT THEY FOUND WAS REGARDLESS OF WHAT CAUSED THE DOPAMINE RELEASE THE FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINE RELEASE PREDICTED HOW THE SUBJECTS PARSED THE TIME BINS OF THE GAME THEY WERE WATCHING WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL WHEN YOU WATCH A BASKETBALL GAME ERE YOU WATCH ANYTHING CHILDREN PLAYING OR TALKING YOUR SPOUSE OR WHATEVER YOURE BATCHING TIME HOW ARE YOU BATCHING TIME WELL YOU COULD BATCH A MEAL BY THE I DON'T KNOW THE APPETISER THE MAIN COURSE IN THE DESSERT BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOURE BATCHING TIME ACCORDING TO THE FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINE PULSES THE FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINE RELEASE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY SAW IN THIS STUDY IF THEY HAVE VALUATED PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT THAT MATCH NOT WHETHER NOT A THE YOU KNOW IT WAS A PARTICULAR TIMEPOINT IN THE GAME NOT WHETHER NOT THEIR TEAM WAS GOING DOWN COURTOR RUNNING BACK UPCORD TO PLAY DEFENCE BUT THET DOPAMINE RELEASE SERVED AS MARKERS WHICH WOULD PREDICT THE FRAME RATE OF THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE EXPERIENCE AND IF THAT SOUNDS COMPLICATED WHAT I MEAN IS HOW OFTEN AND WHEN YOU RELEASED DOPAMINE IS ACTUALLY SETTING THE FRAME RATE ON THE ENTIRE PERCEPTION OF EVERYTHING NOT JUST OF HER POSIVE EVENTS OR NEGATIVE EVENTS SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS AS YOU WERE GOING THROUGH LIFE DOPAMIN AND THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE IS SAYING THAT'S OVER AND NOW YOU'RE IN A NEW PHASE OF YOUR LIFE EVEN IF IT'S VERY SHORT RIGHT SO IF I GET UP IN THE MORNING II REALLY NEED A CUP OF COFFEE AS YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW I WAIT NINEY MINTS TO A HUNDRED TWHENTY A THE HUNDR ED TWENTY MENTS BEFORE I DRINK MY COFFEE BUT THEN I GET MY COFFEE AND SURELY THERE'S A DOPAMINE THAT THERE I PROMISE YOU I ACTUALLY IMSTARTING TO CARVE UP MY DAY ACCORDING TO DOAMINE HITS I AM WITH CONSCIOUSLY OR SUBCONSCIOUSLY IAM ACTUALLY CARVING UP MY EXPERIENCE ACCORDING TO WHEN I'M GETTING DOPAMINE THROUGHOUT MY DAY THIS GOVERNENTS OVER OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME THAT DOPAMINE HAS POINTS TO A VERY CLEAR VERY ACTIONABLE AND VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND THAT IS A TOOL THAT MANY PEEPLE OF TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHICH OUR HABITS PEOPLE OF DISCUSSED HABITS IN A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF DOPAMINE REWARD AND TIME PERCEPTION WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT PLACING SPECIFIC HABITUAL ROUTINES AT PARTICULAR INTERVALS THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY IS A VERY NOT JUST CONVENIENT BUT A VERY GOOD WAY TO INCORPORATE THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM SO THAT YOU DIVIDE YOUR DAY INTO A SERIES OF WHAT I WOULD CALL FUNCTIONAL UNITS WHAT WITH THIS LOOK LIKE IT WOULD MEAN WAKING UP AND HAVING ONE SPECIFIC HABIT YOU ALWAYS ENGAGING THAT CAUSES A RELEASE OF DOPAMINE YOU COULD SAY WHAT GREAT THAT'LL MAKE ME FEEL GOOD AND I WILL WOULD AGREE DOPING RELEASE GENERALLY MAKES US FEEL MODE IF ATED BUT IT WOULD HAVE AN ADDITIONAL EFFECT OF MARKING THAT TIME OF DAY AS THE BEGINNING OF A PARTICULAR TIME BEEN THEN INCERTING ANOTHER HABIT PERHAPS THE BEGINNING OF I DON'T KNOW YOUR BREAKFAST OR SOMETHING BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THAT'S A HABIT AND BEING FAIRLY HABITUAL YOU HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW OBSESSIVELY PRECISE ABOUT THE TIMING BUT THAT THE THAT REGULAR SEQUENCING OF THINGS IS GOING TO LEAD NOTJUS TO DOPAMINE RELEASE AS IT RELATES TO REWARD AND MOTIVATION AND FEELING GOOD BUT IT ACTUALLY BECOMES THE WAY IN WHICH WE CARVE UP OUR ENTIRE EXPERIENCE OF OUR DAY AND THIS IS ALMOST THE CIRCULAR ARGUMEN OU COULD SAYOF COURSE YOU KNOW I DO ONE THING THAT I DO THE NEXT THAN I DO THE NEXT AND THAT'S HOW I PERCEIVE MY DAY THAT'S MY DAY IT'S MY LIST IT'S MY TO DO LIST ET CETERA BUT WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT ON THE BASIS OF THIS STUDY I SHOULD MENTION THE FIRST AUTHOR AS LAST NAME IS ANTONY WIS ANTONY AT ALL OF IS PUNCTION TWENTY TWENTY THE STUDY ON BASCEBALL VIEWING WHAT IT POINTS TO IS THAT BY ENGAGING IN SPECIFIC HABITS THAT WE KNOW WE CAN PERFORM WELL WE ARE ACTUALLY SETTING THE FRAME RATE ON OUR DAY AND SO I THINK THERE WILL SOON COME A TIME WHERE HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT JUST THINKING OF OKAN MY MORNING ROUTINE AND MY AFTERNOON ROUTINE THINK THAT CAN BE USEFUL IN IN FACT I USED WERE MENTIONED A STRUCTURE OF THAT SORT EARLIER IN THEIR EPISODE BUT RATHER THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON AT THE LEVEL OF OUR BIOLOGY WHICH IS THAT DOPAMINE IS MARKING TIME HABITS ARE A VERY CLEAR WAY IN WHICH WE CAN INVOKE DOPAMIN RELEASE AND THEREFORE PROVIDE TIME MARKERS AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT FOR INSTANCE DURING YOUR MORNING YOU MIGHT INCERT HABIT ONE AND HABIT TO AT SAY IT ON AGHT A M AND TEN A M AND IN DOING THAT THAT MARCHS AN EPOCH A LITTLE BATCH OF TIME IN YOUR MORNING ROUTINE THAT'S DISTINCT FROM THE SECOND HALF YOUR MORNING IN OTHER WORDS HABITS SERVE AS FLANKERS OR MARKERS FOR THE PASSAGE OF YOUR DAY NOW IF THAT SEEMS KIND OF HYPERNOROTIC OR WHY WOULD I WANT STRUCTURE MY LIFE LIKE THAT I WOULD SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD DO WELL TO STRUCTURE THEIR LIFE LIKE THAT INTO UTILIZE HABITS NOTCIOUS FOR SAKE OF WHAT YOU DO DURING THE HABIT BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE HABITS SERVE AS A MARKER BE CAUSE OF THE WAY THEY CAN EVOKE DOPAMINE RELEASE AND IN DOING THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO SEGMENT YOUR DAY INTO A BUNCH OF SMALLER IF YOU WANT THEM TO BE SMALLER OR LARGER FUNCTIONAL UNITS IF ANY ONE WANTS TO EXPERIMENT WITH THIS THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST PUTS OUT A NEWS LETTERS CALLED THE NURAL NETWORK NEWS LETTER YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR IT AT HUBERMAN

NEWS LETTER I INTEND TO INCLUDE A EXAMPLE PROTOCAL OF HOW ONE COULD USE HABITS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HABITS AND DOPAMINE DOPEMING AND TIME PERCEPTION TO STRUCTUREOUR DAY ACCORDING TO PERFORMANCE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF TASTS TO DAY WE COVERED TA LOT ABOUT TIME PERCEPTION WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING ABOUT TIME PERCEPTION BUT WE COVERED THINGS LIKE IN TRAINMENT THE ROLL OF

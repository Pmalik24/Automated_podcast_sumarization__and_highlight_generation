WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANSCIENCESCIENCE TATO I MANDR HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR DAVIDSON CLAIR PROFESSOR OF GENETICS AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND CODIRECTOR OF THE PULL F GLEN CENTER FOR THE BIOLOGY OF AGENG DOCTOR SINCLAIR'S WORK IS FOCUST ON WHY WE AGE AND HOW TO SLOW OR REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF AGEING BY FOCUSING ON THE CELLILER AND MOLECULAR PATHWAYS THAT EXIST IN ALL CELLS OF THE BODY AND THAT PROGRESS THOSE CELLS OVER TIME FROM YOUNG CELLS TO OLD CELLS BY ELUCIDATING THE BIOLOGY OF CELLILAR MATURATION AND AGING DOCTOR SIN CLIR'S GROUP HAS FIGURED OUT INTERVENTION POINTS BY WHICH ANY OF US INDEED ALL OF US CAN SLOW OR REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF AGENG WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT HIS WORK IS THAT IT FOCUSES ON BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIENS AS WELL AS SUPPLEMENTATION AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN HELP US ALL AGE MORE SLOWLY AND REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF AGING IN ALL TISSUES OF THE BODY DOCTOR SAINCLAIR HOLDS A UNIQUE AND REVOLUTIONARY VIEW OF THE AGING PROCESS WHICH IS THAT AGING IS NOT THE NORMAL AND NATURAL CONSEQUENTE THAT WE ALL WILL SUFFER BUT RATHER THAT AGING IS A DISEASE THAT CAN BE SLOWED OR HALTED DOCTOR SIN CLAIR CONTINUALLY PUBLISHES ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLES IN THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AND COMPETITIVE SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IN ADDITION TO THAT HE'S PUBLISHED A POPULAR BOOK THAT WAS A NEW YORK TIMES BEST CELLER THE TITLE OF THAT BOOK IS A LIFE SPAN WHY WE AGE AND WHY WE DON'T HAVE TO HE IS ALSO VERY ACTIVE IN PUBLIC FACING EFFORTS TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ON THE BIOLOGY OF AGING AND SLOWING THE AGING PROCESS DOCTOR SAINCLAIR AND I SHARE A MUTUAL INTEREST AND EXCITEMENT IN PUBLIC EDUCATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SO I'M THRILL TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE PARTNERD AND DOCTOR DAVIDSON CLAIR IS GOING TO BE LAUNCHING THE LIFE SPAN PODCAST WHICH IS ALL ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF AGING AND TOOLS TO INTERVENE IN THE AGING PROCESS THAT PODCAST WILL LAUNCH WEDNESDAY JANUARY FIFTH YOU CAN FIND IT AT THE LINK IN THE SHONOTES TO THIS EPISODE TO DAY AS WELL YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE TO THAT PODCAST ON YOUTUBE APPLE OR SPOTIFY OR ANYWHERE THAT YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS AGAIN THE LIFSPAN PODCAST REATURING DOCTOR DAVIDSON CLAIR BEGINS WEDNESDAY JANUARY FIFTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO BE SURE TO CHECK IT OUT YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN BOTH THE MECHANISTIC SCIENCE BEHIND AGING THE MECHANISTIC SCIENCE BEHIND REVERSING THE AGING PROCESS AND PRACTICAL TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE IN TO DAY'S EPISODE DOCTOR SON CLAIR AND I TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF AGING AND TOOLS TO INTERVENE IN THAT PROCESS AND SO YOU MIGHT VIEW TODAY'S EPISODE AS A PRIMER FOR THE LIFE SPAN PODCAST BECAUSE WE DELVE DEEP INTO THE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NUTRITIONAL ASPECTS SUPPLEMENTATION ASPECTS OF THE BIOLOGY OF AGING WE ALSO TALK ABOUT DAVID'S IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES OF THE SIRTUINS PARTICULAR MOLECULAR COMPONENTS THAT INFLUENCE WHAT IS CALLED THE EP GENOM AND IF YOU DO'T KNOWHAT THE EPIGENOM IS YOU WILL SOON LEARN IN TO DAY'S EPISODE COMING AWAY FROM TODAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE INDEPTH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF AGING AT THE CELLLER MALECULAR AND WHAT WE CALL THE CIRCUIT LEVEL MEANING HOW THE DIFFERENT ORGANS AND TISSUES OF THE BODIES AGE INDEPENDENTLY AND HOW THEY INFLUENCE THE AGING OF EACH OTHER TODAY'S EPISODE GETS INTO DISCUSSION ABOUT MANY ASPECTS OF AGING AND TOOLS TO COMBAT AGING THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSED ON ANY OTHER PODCAST OR IN THE BOOK LIFE SPEND BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SIGNCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFISCIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITH OUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER HE'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CAROVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PETASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPERATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR IDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLIGHTS IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT E DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'L GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT E DO CALM SLASH HUBERM AND NOW MY CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR DAVID SINT CLARE THANK YOU FOR COMING THENS HAVE ME  CO DESEE THIS IS MATE BY THE WAY THE WERE TUSTING TA ELEVEN I AM HAN LIKE OTHER POT CAST WE WHY DON'T DRINK OUT ALSO I'M BORING THAT WAY BUT TRULY THANKS FOR BEING HERE I HAVE A TONIC QUESTIONS FOR YOU WE GO AWAY BACK IN SOME SENSE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DON'T HAVE MANY MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT AGING LONGEVITY LIFE SPAN ACTIONABLE PROTOCALLS TO INCREASE HOW LONG WE LIVE ET CETERA I JUST WANT TO START OFF WITH A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION 'M NOT EVEN TRU THERES AND ANSWER TO BUT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LONGEVITY ANTIAGING AND AGING AS A DISEASE BECAUSE I ASSOCY YOU WITH THE STATEMENT AGING IS A DISEASE RIGHT WELL SO LONGEVITY IS THE THE MORE ACADEMIC WAY WE DESCRIBE WHAT WE RESEARCH ANTI AGING IT'S CONE OF THE SAME THING BUT IT'S GOT A BAD RAT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN USED BY HOL BUNCH PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY TOKIN ABOUT SO I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT TERMANTA AGING BUT AGING AS A DISEASE AND LONGEVITY ARE PERFECTLY VALID WAYS TOK ABOUT THIS SUBJECT SO LHETSTO ABOUT AGING AS A DISEASE WHEN I STARTED MY RESEARCH DISEASE YOURE HOVERD MEDICAL SCHOOL IT WAS CONSIDERED IIF THE'S SOMETHING THAT'S WRONG WITH YOU A AND IT'S A RARE THING HAS BE LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT THE POPULATION THAT'S DEFINITELY A DISEASE AND THEN PEOPLE WORK THEIR WHOLE LIVES TO TRYIND CURE THAT CONDITION AND SO I LOOKE UP WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF AGING ANDS AYS WELL TO DETERORATION AND IN HEALTH AND SICKNESS AND YOU CAN DIE FROM IT FICALLY YOU DO SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS PRETTY MUCH LIKE A DISEASE BUT THE CAVIOT IS THAT IF MORE THAN HALF THE POPULATION GETS THIS CONDITION AGING H IT'S PUT IN A DIFFERENT BUCKET WHICH IS FISIAL THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS CAUSE I IT'S JUST A THE TOTALLY ARBITRARY CUT OFF BUT THINK ABOUT THIS THAT WE'RE IGNORING THE MAJOR CAUSE OF ALL THESE DISEASES AGING IS EIGHTY AND NINETY PER CENT THE CAUSE OF HOT DISEASE ALTSIMERS IF WE DIDN'T GET OLD AND O BODY'S STAYED YOUTHFUL WE WOULD NOT GET THOSE DISEASES AND ACTUALLY WHAT WAS SHOWING MY LABLES F YOU TURN THE CLOCK BACK IN TISSUES THOSE DISEASES GO AWAY SO AGING IS THE PROBLEM AND INSTEAD THROUGH YOUR MOST THE LOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS WE BEEN STICKING BANDADES ON DISEASES THAT AVE ALREADY OCCURRED BECAUSE OF AGING AND THEN IT'S TOO LATE SO THERE COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS YOU WANT A SLOW AGING DOWNS WE DON'T GET THOSE DISEASES AND WHEN THEY DO OCCUR DON'T YOU STIK A BANDATE ON REVERSE THE AGE OF THE BODY AND THEN THE DISEASES WILL GO AWAY THAT CLARIFIES A LOT FOR ME THANK YOU CAN WE POINT TO ONE SPECIFIC GENERAL PHENOMENON IN THE BODY THAT UNDERLIES AGENT YR WELL THAT THAT'S CONTENTIOUS BECAUSE YOUR SCIENTIS LIKE TO COME UP WITH NEW HYPOTHESES US M IT'SHATHE GIL THEIR CAREERS BUT FORTUNATELY DURING THE TWO THOUSANDS WE SETTLED ON EIGHT OR NINE MAJOR CAUSES OF AGING WE CALL THEM HOLE MARKS CAS CAUSES WITH WAS LITTLE BIT TOO STRONG BUT THESE THESE EIGHT OR NINE CAUSES AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST TIME ALLOWED US TO COME AROUND AND TALK TOGETHER WE PUT PUT THEM ON A ON A PETS A SOVONE GOT AN EQUAL WAITING EQUAL SLICES  BUT BEFORE THAT BY THE WAY WE WERE TRYN TO KILL EACH OTHER IN THE FIELD IT WAS HORRIBLE INCOSTING THAT YOU GUESS WORK ON AGIN I TRN A KILLYGYESN'T IT WELL  KILL EACH OTHER'S CAREERS WHEN I LIKE TO THINK I WAS FILLY GENEROUS BUT I WAS ONE OF THE KIDS AND THE OLD GUARD REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE NEW GUARD WE WE JUST CAME ALONG IN THE NINETEEN NIGHTIES ANC NINTIES AND SAID FREE RADICALS DON'T DO MUCH THE THERR ACTUALLY GENES CALL ON GEVITYGENES AND THAT CAUSE A WHOLE RARKES AND THERE WAS THIS COMPETITION FOR WHAT NEVER HAPPEN WHICH WAS NOBLE PRIZE FOR THIS AND IT JUST LED TO A LOT OF COMPETITION YOU I WOULD GO TO MEETINGS AND PEOPLE WOULD SHOUTED EACH OTHER AND SBACKS TAT WAS HORRIBLE BUT THEN FORTUNATELY THE TWO THOUSAND WE RAULED AROUND THIS NEW MAP OF AGING WITH THESE CAUSES OF WHOLE MARKS BUT I BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S ONE SLICE OF THE PEACE SO THAT IS WAY LARGER THAN THE OTHERS AND WE CAN GET TO THAT BUT THAT'S THE INFORMATION IN THE CELL THAT I CALL WE CALL THE EPIGENON BELL TELLSO BUT MORE ABOUT THE EPIGENO A FRAM IT FOR US IM IF IF YOU WILL AND IM AND THEN WELL GET INTO WAYS THAT ONE CAN ADJUST THE EPIGENOMAN POSITIVE WAYCS YES OIN SCIENCE WAT WHAT I LIKE TO DO A REDUCTIONIST IS TO BOIL IT DOWN AND I ACTUALLY AND IT UP BOILING AGING DOWN TO AN EQUAGEN WHICH IS THE THE LOSS OF INFORMATION GUR ANTROPY S IT'S A HARD THING TO OVERCOME SECOND LOW THE MADANAMACS THAT'S THAT'S THERE BUT THIS A QUASION  REALLY REPRESENTS THE FACT THAT I THINK AGING IS A LOSS OF INFORMATION IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN YOU ZEROC SOMETHING A A THOUSAND TIMES YOU'LL LOSE THAT INFORMATION OR YOU TRY TO COPY IT ET SEID TA OR EVEN IF YOU SEND INFORMATION ACROSS THE INFINATE SOME OF IT WILL GET LOST THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS AGING AND THERE WARE TWO TYPES OF INFORMATION IN THE BODY THERE IS THE GENETIC INFORMATION WHICH IS DIGITAL A T C G THE CHEMICAL LETTERS OF DENA BUT THERE'STHIS OTHER PART OF THE INFORMATION IN THE BODY THAT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT IT'S ESSENTIAL IN FACT AND THAT'S THE SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL WHICH GENES AS WITCHED ON AND OFF IN WHAT SELL AT WHAT TIME IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE EAT ET CETERA AND IT TURNS OUT THAT EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR FUTURE LON GEVITY AND HEALTH IS CONTROLL BY THIS SECOND PART THE EPIGENETIC INFOMATION THE CONTROL SYSTEMS I LIKEN THE DENA TO THE THE MUSIC THAT'S ON A D V D OR COMPACT DISK FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE USE TO USE THE THINGS I RECALL THE OTHER AND THEN THE EPIGENOM IS THE READER THAT SAYS OKE IN THIS SELL WE NEED TO PLAY THAT SET OF SONGS AND IN THIS OTHER SELL WEAFE TO PLAY A DIFFERENT CITOSONGS BUT OVER TIME AGING IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SCRATCHING THE CID AND THE DEVITY SO THAT YOU YOU NOT PLAYING THE RIGHT SONGS AND CELLS WHEN THEY DON'T HEAR THE RIGHT SONGS THEY GET MISSED UP AND THEY DON'T FUNCTION WELL AND THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYING IS THE MAIN DRIVER OF AGING AND THESE OTHER WHOLE MARKS AR LARGELY MANIFESTATIONS OF THAT PROCESS CAN WE GO A LITTLE DEEPER INTO WHAT THE THESE SCRATCHES ARE IS IT THE WAY THAT THE D'ANNA ARE PACKED IN TO A CELL IS IT THE WAY THAT A THEIR SPACE OR WHAT IS WHAT ARE THE SCRATCHES THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SO DENA IS SIX FOOT LONG SOIF YOU JOIN YOU CROMES HOMES TOGETHER GET AT SIX FOOT PERCELL SO THERE'S ENOUGH TO GO TO THE MOON AND BACK EIGHT TIMES ANY BODY ND IT HAS TO BE WRAPPED UP TO EXIST IN INSIDE US BUT IT'S NOT JUST WRAPPED UP WILLI NELL IT'S NOT JUST A BUNDLE OF STRING IT'S WRAPPED UP VERY CAREFULLY IN WAYS THA DICTATES WHICH GENES A SWHICHED ON AND OFF AND WHEN WE'RE DEVELOPING IN THE EMBRYO THE SELL MARKS THE DENA WITH CHEMICALS THAT SAYS A THIS GENE IS FOR A NERVE CELL YOU YOU SELL WILL STAY AND OE CELL FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS IF YOU'RE LUCKY DON'T TURN INTO A SKIN CELL THAT WOULD BE BAD AND THOSE CHEMICALS AP THERE ARE MANY DIFERENT TYPES OF CHEMICALS BUT ONCE CALLED METHELATION THOSE LITTLE METHALS WILL MARK WHICH SONGS GET PLAYED FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND THERRE OTHER MARKS THAT CHANGE DAILY BUT IN TOTO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THE BODY CONTROLS THE GENO THROUGH THE ABILITY TO MARK THE DENA AND THEN COMPACT SOME PARTS OF IT SILENCE THOSE GENES DON'T READ THOSE GENE AND OPEN OTHERS KEEP OTHERS OPEN THAT SHOULD STAY OPEN AND THAT PATTERN OF GENES THEIR SILENT AND OPEN SILENT OPEN IS WHAT DICTATES THE SELLS TYPE THE SELLS FUNCTION AND THIN THE SCRATCHES ARE THE DESRUPTION OF THAT SO GENES THAT WERE ONCE SILENT AND YOU COULD SAY IT'S E GENE THAT IS INVOLVED IN SKIN IT'S SIN TO COME ON IN THE BRAIN SHOULDN'T BE THERE BUT WE SEE THIS HAPPEN AND VICE PECER THE GENE MIHT GET SHUT OFF EVER TIME DURING AGING E SELLS OVERA TIME LOSE THESE STRUCTURES LOSE THEIR IDENTITY THEY FORGET WHAT THEY SUPPOSED TO DO AND WE GET DISEASES WE CALL THAT AGING AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT IN FACT WE CAN MEASURE IT IN SUCH A WAY WE CAN PREDICT WHEN SOMEBODY'S GO TO DIE BASED ON THE CHANGES IN THOSE CHEMICALS ARE THESE CHANGES THE SAME SORTS OF CHANGES THAT UNDERLIE THE OUTWARD BODY SURFACE MANIFESTATIONS OF AGING THAT MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH GRAYING OF THE HAIR WRINKLING OF THE SKIN DROOPING OF THE A OF THE FACE OM A A WALK AROUND NEW YORK LATELY IT'S AMAZING TO ME THER CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT SEEM TO WALK LOOKING DOWN AT THE SIDEWALK BECAUSE THER THEIR SPINE IS ESSENTIALLY IN A SEA SHAPE RIGHT AM HALL MARK IF YOU WILL OF AGING THAT MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH AR THESE SAME SORTS OF GE AN A SCRATCHES ASSOCIATE WITH THAT OR WE TALKING OUT PEOPLE THAT ARE BOTENTIALLYOU ARE GOING TO LOOK OLDER BUT SIMPLY LIVE LONGER AH WELL IT'S ACTUALLY YOU YOU ARE AS OLD AS YOU LOOK IF YOU WANT TA GENERAL LIVES AM O LET START WITH CENTINARIAN FAMILIES THESE ARE FAMILIES ATTEND TO LIVE OVER A HUNDRED WHEN THEYRE SEVENTY THEY STILL OOK FIFTY OR LESS SO IT IS A GOOD GOOD INDICATOR IT'S NOT PERFECT BECAUSE YOU CAN LIKE ME GROW UP IN A SCRALIAR AND EXCELERATE THE AGING OF YOUR SKIN AH BETDING GENERAL HOW YOU LOOK NO ONES EVER DIED FROM GRAY HAIR BUT OVER ALL YOU CAN GET A SENSE JUST FROM THE BILITY OF SKIN TO HOLD ITSELF UP HOW THIN IT IS THE NUMBER OF WRINKLES THAT IS ACTUALLY  A GREAT PAPER JUST CAME OUT THAT SAID THAT AN AI SYSTEM LOOKING AT THE FACE COULD VERY ACCURATELY PREDICT SOME ONE'S AGE VERY INTERESTING SO I STARTED OFTIN DEVELOPMENTAL NEROMIOLOGY SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED EARLY ON THAT I STILL BELIEVE A WHOLE HEARTEDLY IS THAT DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T STOP AT AGE TWELVE OR FIFTEEN OR EVEN TWENTY FIVE THAT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IS ONE DELONG DEVELOPMENTAL ART SO IN THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THAT DEVELOPMENTAL ART THE EARLY PORTION OF INFANCY AND ESPECIALLY PUBERITY SEEM LIKE ESPECIALLY RAPID STAGES OF AGING AND I KNOW WE NORMALLY LOOK AT BABIES AND CHILDREN ANGITS AND PURITING WE THINK ALL THEY'RE SO VITAL THEY'RE SO YOUNG AND YET THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THESE CHANGES IN THE EPIGINOM AND THE WAY YOU ARE FRAMED AGING AS A DISEASE LEADS ME TO ASK OUR PERIODS OF OF IMMENSE VITALITY THE SAME PERIODS WHEN WERE AGING FASTER YES YES AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT A AT LEAST NOT PUBLICLY SO THAS REALLY GOO QUESTION SO THOSE CHEMICALS WE CAN MEASURE A IT'S IT'S ALSO KNON ACE THE HORE BATH CLOCK AT'S THE BIOLOGICAL CLOCK ATS SEPARATE FROM YOUR CHRONOLOGICAL AGE SECIALLY WHAT I DIDN'T MENTION IS THAT WHEN THE A I LOOKED AT THE FACES OF THOSE PEOPLE THEY COULD PREPREDICT THEIR BIOLOGICAL AGE THEYR INTERNAL AGE SO YOUR SKIN REPRESENTS THE AGE OF YOUR ORGANS AS WELL AND THE PEOPLE THAT LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES WE CAN TAK ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT LATER BUT THE THERE'ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE TEN TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER THAN OTHER PEOPLE A BIOLOGICALLY AND TURNS OUT IF YOU MEASURE THAT CLOCK FROM BIRTH OR EVEN BEFORE BIRTH IF YOU LOOK AT ANIMALS HERE'S A MASSIVE INCREASE IN AGE ON BASE ON THAT CLOCK EARLY IN LIFE SO YOU ARE RIGHT THAT SO THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOUYU HAVE ACCELERATED AGING DURING THE FIRST FO YEARS OF LIFE AND THEN IT GOES LINER TOWARDS THE REST OF YOUR LIFE BUT THERE'S ANOTHER INTERESTING THING YOU BROUGHT UP WHICH IS WET FINDING THAT THE GENES THAT GET MESSED OP THAT GET SCRATCHED THAT A LEADING TO AGING AGING ALL THOSE EARLY DEVELOP MENTAL GENES THEY COME ON LAD IN LIFE AND JUST MISS UP THE SYSTEM AND THEY SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THOSE SCRATCHES SO WHAT OUT WHATS CAUSING THE SCRATCHES WHELL WE KNOW OF A COUPLE OF THINGS IN MY LIFE WE FIG IT OUT ONE IS BROKEN CROMISONS DENA DAMAGE PARTICULARLY CUTS TO THE DENA BRAKS SO FYOU IF YOU HAVE AN EX RAY OR COSMIC GRAY OR EVEN IF YOU GO OUT IN THE SUN AND YOU'LL GET YOUR BROKEN CROMISONS THAT EACCELERATES THE UNWINDING OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL DENA LOOPS THAT I MENTION A WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS TOAMOUSE WE CAN ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS AND WE GET AN OLD MOUSE FIFTY PER CENT OLDER AND IT HAS THIS BENCE SPINE CAFOSUS IT HAS GRAY HAIR IT'S OLGANS ARE ALL SO WE NOW CON CONTROL AGING THE FOLDS DIRECTION THE OTHER THING THAT ACCELERATES AGING IS MASSIVE CELL DAMAGE OR STRESS SO WE PINCHED NERVES AND WE SAW THAT THEIR AGENT CROCESS WAS ACCELERATED AS WELL CREDIBLE YET THE THIS IS MORE OF VAN ANIC DOTAL A PHENOMENON IT IS AN ANICTOTAL PHENOMENON BUT THIS EXPERIENCE OF IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL YOUR GOING HOME FOR A SUMMER NDEU COME BACK HIGH SCHOOL IN TH YOU ASKE USUALLY STARTS EIGHTH OR NINTH GRATE OR GREAT EIGHT OR GREAT NINE FOR YOUR CONNEDIANS AND THEN SOME OF THE KIDS LIKE THEY GREW BEERDS OVER THE SUMMER OR THEY COMPLETELY MATURED QUICKLY OVER THE SUMMER DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT RATES OF ENTRY INTO AND THROUGH PUBERITY HAVE CAN PREDICT OVER ALL RATES OF AGING IN OTHER WORDS IF A KID IS A A THEYOUNOW A SLOW BURNER RIGHT THEY THEY BASICALLY ACQUIRE THE THE TRAITS OF PUBERITY SLOWLY OVER MANY YEARS CAN WE MAKE SOME COURSE PREDICTION THAT THEY ARE GOING TO LIVE A LONG TIME VERSES A KID THAT GOES HOME FOR THE SUMMER AND COMES BACK A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ORGANISM AR APPEARING TO BE A COMPLETE OF AN ORGANISM IKE THEY BUSY AGED VERY QUICKLY IN THE SUMMER TO THAT MEAN THEIR AGING VERY QUICKLY OVER ALL WELL YHE I DON'T WANT TO SCARE ANYBODY SURE THAT THERE THERE THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THE SLOWER YOU TAKE TO DEVELOP IT ALSO IS PREDICTIVE OF HAVING A LONGER HEALTHIER LIFE A AND IT MAY HAVE SOME TO DO WITH GROWTH HORMON WE KNOW THE GROWTH HORMON IS PRO AGING ANY ONE WHO'S TAKEN GROWTHHORMON IN A PAY ATTENTION WE KNOW THES LOOK AT SOME ONE OS TAKING GROWTH HORMON YE THEY OFTEN WI ACQUIRE THESE A CHARACTERISTICS OF VITALITY LIKE IMPROVED A SMOOTHNESS OF SKIN B AT THE E BODY SHAPE CHANGE YE ON YOU FILL BETT FEEL BETTER FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'LL BUILD AP MUSCLE YOU FEEL GREAT BUT IT'S LIKE BURNING YOUR CANDLE ABOVENS ULTIMATELY IF DON'T LIVE LONG YOU WANT LESS OF THAT AND THE ANIMALS THAT AVE BEEN GENERATED A AND MUTENTS THAT HAVE LOW GROWTH HORMON SOMETIMES THESE A DWARFS  THEY LIVE THE LONGEST BY FAR AI GUIDE MY LAD MICHAEL BONCOWSKI HE HAD THE LONGEST LIV MOUSE A MOUSE TYPICALLY LIVES ABOUT TO AN A BIT YEARS HE HAD A MOUSE THAT LIVED FIVE YEARS AND HE GAVE IT CLORIC RESTRICTIONS WIT FASTING COMBINED WITH ONE OF THESE DWARF MUTATIONS LOW GROWTH HORMON I THINK CALLED IT YODA BUT THI THIS IN NO YOU LOOK AT WHO WHO LIVES THE LONGEST IT'S THE REALLY SMALL PEOPLE A THIS IS BIT ANECDOTAL BUT IT SOUNDS SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE TRUE IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PLAYED THE MUNCHKINS IN THE WIZARD OF AS MANY OF THEM WENT ON TO LIVE INTO THE NINES AND BEYOND REALLY AH MAZIN O THERE AR SOM LOI LOREN DWARFS AS WELL THERE ARE DWARF AM BUTATIONS A IN SOUTH AMERICA AND THEY SEEM TO BE PROTECTED AGAINST MANY OF THE DISEASE OF AGING YOU BARELY EVER SEE HO TO SESE OR CANTSER IN THESE FAMILIES SO I HAVING OWNED A VERY LARGE DOG BREED A BULLDOG MASTIF WHO LIVED A LONG LIFE FOR A BULLDOG ELEVEN YEARS BUT THERRE MANY DOGS THAT WILL LIVE TWELVE SIXTEEN YEARS THAT AR SMALLER DOGS CAN WE SAY THAT THERE IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY SIZE AND LONGEVITY OR IT DURATION OF OF OF LIFE WELL THAT THERE IS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE SLAVE TO YOUR EARLY EPIGINO NOR TO EURGENO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE EPIGINO CAN CHANGE THOSE LOOPS AND STRUCTURES CAN BE MODIFIED BY HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE AND SO IF IF YOURE BORN TOLL AND I WASN'T AND I WISH AT THE TIME I I DID OR A BUT NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU ARE YOU CAN HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE THAN ANYTHING EUGENES GIVE YOU EIGHTY PERCENT IS EPIGINETIT NOT GINETIC SO THET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO AND I I'VE CONE TO BACH THES IN TO CATEGUORIES AM RATHER THAN JUST DIVING RITE INTO ACTIONABLE PROTOCALLS SO THE FIRST ONE RELATES TO FOOD BLOOD SUGAR INSOLENT THIS IS ONELHING I HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT FASTING IS GOOD FOR US BUT RARELY DO I HEAR WHY IT'S GOOD FOR US O IM ONE OF THE REASONS I'M EXCITE TALK TO YOU TO DAYS BECAUSE I WANT A DRILLING TO THE DETAILS OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISM WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES AND NOT SIMPLY TO JUST DECIDE WHETHER NOT THEY'RE GOING TO FAST OR NOT FAST OR HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING T FAST I THINK SHOU'LD BE DICTATED BY SOME UNDERSTANDING ON THE MECHANISM SO WHY IS IT THAT HAVING ELEVATED BLOOD SUGAR BLUCOS AND INSOLEN AGES US MORE QUICKLY AND OR WY IS IT THAT HAVING PERIODS OF TIME EACH DAY OR PERHAPS LONGER CAN EXTEND OUR LIFESPEN WELL AT LET STARE WITH WITH WHAT I THINK WAS A BIG MISTAKE WAS THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER BE HUNGRY WE LIVE IN A WORLD NOW WITH IS AT LEAST THREE MEALS A DAY AND THEN WEE GO COMPANY SELLING BARS AND A SNACKS IN BETWEEN SO THE FEELING OF HUNGER O SOME PEOPLE NEVER EXPENCE HUNGER IN THE WHOLE LIVES IT'S REALLY REALLY BAD FOR THEM A IT WAS BASED I BELIEVE ON THE TWENTYTH CENTURY VIEW TAT YOU DON'T WANT TO STRESS OUT THE PANCREUS IAN YOU TRY TO KEEP INSLEN LEVELS PRETTY STEADY I AND NOT HAVE THI S THIS FLUCTUATION WHAT WE ACTUALLY FOUND A MY COLLEAGUES AND I ACROSS THIS FIELD OF LUNC EVITY IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK IT FOT ALL ANIMALS WHETHER IT'S A DOG OR MOUSE OR MONKEY THE ONES THAT LIVE THE LONGEST BY FAR THIRTY PER CENT LONGER AND STAY HEALTHY OTHER ONES THAT DON'T EAT ALL THE TIME ACTUALLY WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BACK IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY BUT PEOPLE IGNORED IT AND THERE WAS REDISCOVERED IN OR THE NINETEEN THIRTIES CLIV MACAID CLARK RESTRICTION HE PUT SELL YOUR LEWS IN THE FOOD OF RATS SO THEY COULDN'T GET AS MANY CALORIES EVEN THOUGH THEY AT AND THOSE RATS LIVED THIRTY PERCENT LONGER BUT THEN IT IT WENT AWAY AND THEN CAME BACK IN THE TWO THOUSANDS IN A BIG WAY WHEN A COUPLE OF THINGS HAPPEN ONE IS THAT O MY LAB AND OTHERS SHOWED THAT THERE ARE LONGEVITY GENES IN THE BODY THAT COME ON IN PROTECT US FROM AGING AND DISES THE GROUP OF GENES THAT I WORK ON A CALLED SIRTUANS AS SEVEN OF THEM AND WE SHOW IT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE IN A SIENCE PAPER THAT IF YOU HAVE LOW LEVELS OT INSOLEN AND ANOTHER MULCULE CALLED INSOLENT LIKE GROWTH FACTOR THOSE LOW LEVELS TURN ON THE LONGEVITY GNES ONE OF THEM THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS CALLED SORT ONE AND BUT BY HAVING HIGH LEVELS OF INSOLEN ALL DAY BEING FED MEANS YOUR LONGEVITY GENES ARE NOT SWITCHED ONE SO YOUR FALLIN APART YOUR EPIGINO ON YOUR INFORMATION THAT KEEP YOURSELVES FUNCTIONING OVER TIME JUST A GRADS QUICKYO YOU CLOCK IS TICKING FASTER BY ALWAYS BEING FED O THE OTHER THING THAT I THING MIGHT BE HAPPENING BY ALWAYS HAVING FOOD AROUND IS THAT IT'S NOT ALLOWING THE CELL TO HAVE PERIODS OF REST AND AND RE ESTABLISHED THE EPIGENO AND SO IT ALSO IS EXCELERATING IN THAT DIRECTION THE'S PLENTY OF OTHER REASONS AS WELL THAT ARE NOT AS PROFOUND SUCH AS HAVING LOW LEVELS OF GLUCOS IN YOUR BODY WILL TRIGU OR MAJYOUR MUSCLES IN YOUR BRAIN TO BECOME MORE RESA SENSITIVE TO INSOLEN AND SUCKD THE GLUCOS OUT OF YOUR BLOODSTREAM WHICH IS VERY GOOD YOU DON'T ONE HAVE LUCOS FLOWING AROUND TOO MUCH AND THAT WELL WOR OFF TUTH Y DIBES SO HUNGER OF COURSE IS ASSOCIATE WITH LOW BLOOD LUCOS AND LOW INSOLEN DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANYTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF HUNGER ITSELF THEY COULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR LONGEVITY YEI I DO AH THOUGH YOU GET USED TO THE FEELING OF NOT EATING SO 'M KINDISCRRED THAT WAY LIKE COLD WATER YOU EVENTUALLY A DOUT YOU GET USED TO IT ANFON UNFORTUNATLY BUT THERE THERE ARE SOME STUDIES THAT ARE BEING DONE AT THE NATIONALLINSITUS OF HEALTH THAT ARE ABLE TO SIMULATE THE EFFECT OF HUNGER BUT STILL PROVIDE THE GALERIES AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE THES A SMALL COMPONENT THAT'S JU TO HUNGER BUT MOST OF IT ACTUALLY IS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THIS THESE PERIODS OF NOT BEING FED AND THEN THE BODY TURNS ON THESE DEFENSIVE GENES O THERE'S REALLY INTERESTING EXPERIMENT THAT WAS PUBLISHED MAY BE COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BY ROPHIL DACABO DOWN AT EINNIAGE WHAT HE DID WAS YEU TOOK OV TEN THOUSAND MICE AND GAVE THEM DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF FAT CO A HIDRATE PROUTINE AND YOU'S TRY TO FIGER OUT WHAT WAS THE BEST COMBINATION AND THE YOU ALSO CLEVERLY HAD A GROUP WELL TWO GROUPS ONE THAT WAS FED ALL THE TIME OR ATE AS MUCH AS THEY WANTED AND THE OTHER GROUP WAS ONLY GIVEN FOOD FOR AN HOUR A DAY AND IT TURNS OUT THEY ATE ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF CALORIES CAUSE OF COURSE IN AN HOUR THE STUFFING THEIR FACES IT TURNS OUT IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT DIET HE GAVE THEM IT WAS ONLY THE GROUP THAT ATE WITHIN THAT WINDOW THAT LIVED LONGER AND DRAMATICALLY LONGER SO MY CONCLUSION IS AND MICE ARE VERY SIMILAR TO OSTIMATE ABOLICALY I THINK THAT TELLS US THAT IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT WHAT YOU EAT IT'S WHEN YOU EAT DURING THE DAY WHAT IS THE PROTOCAL THAT PEOPLE CAN EXTRAPLATE FROM THAT UM OR MAY YOU SHOULD JUST ASK YOU WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCALL FOR WHEN TO EAT AND WHEN TO AVOID FOOD DO YOU FAST DO YOU EVER FAST LONGER THAN TWHENTY FOUR HOURS WHAT DO YOU DO AND WHAT D YOU THINK IS A GOOD JUMPING OFF PLACE IF PEOPLE WANT TO EXPLORER THI AS A PROTOCOL WELL IF TI'S ONE THING I I COULD SAY IF I WAS SA DEAFINITELY TRY TO SKIP A MEAL THE DAY THAT'S THE BEST THING DOES IT MATTER WHICH MEAL FOR THEY ARE SUCH A EQUIVALN WELL AS LONG AS IT'S AT THE END OR THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU ADD THAT TO THE SLEEP PERIOD WHER YOU HUWFULY NOT EATING I THIN THAT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT ARISES US IT'S A IMBORMBAT I THNG IS AN EXCELL ONE BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH THE MOST IS KNOWING WHEN AND HOW TO INITIATE THIS SO CALLED INTERMITTAN FASTIN AND THE MIDDL OF THE DAY OBVIOUSLY IS NOT ATTACKD TO THE SLEEP CYCLE ON THE SAME WAY SO IT'S MUCH HARDER AS WELL FOR MANY PEOPLE YERE WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DO II I SKIP BREAKFAST TO HAVE A TINY BIT OF YOUR G OR ALOV OIL BECAUSE THE SUPPLEMENTS I HAVE NEED TO BE DISSOLVED IN IT ND THEN I GO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DAY AS I'M DOING RIGHT NOW HERE WITH THIS ITHIS GLASS OF WATER HERE I' JUST KEEPG MYSELF FILLED WITH LIQUIDS AND SO I DON'T FEEL HUNGRY BEWARE THAT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS WHEN YOU TRY THAT YOU WILL FILL HUNGRY ANDYOU ALSO HAVE A HABIT OF WANTING TOS CHEW ON SOMETHING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PHYSICAL PARTS TO IT BUT TRY TO MAKE THROUGH THE FIRST THREE WEEKS AND DO WITHOUT BREAKFAST OR DO WITHOUT DINNER AND I YOU GET THROUGH IT ND I DID THAT MOST FOR MOST OF MY LIFE ACTUALLY MAINLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T I WASN'T HUNGRY IN THE MORNING SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY HUNGRY IN THE MORNING AND THEY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SKIPPING DINNER INSTEAD BUT I WILL GO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DAY I DON'T GET THE CRASHES OF THE HIGH GLUCOS AND THE LOW GLUCOS THAT ANY ONE WHO GOES AR MEN AS THREE O'CLOCK I AM GOIING NEED A SLEEP IF YOU DO WHAT I DO YOU WILL NOT EXPERIENCE THAT ANY MORE BECAUSE WHAT MY BODY DOES IS IT IT REGULATES BLOOD SHUGA LEVELS NATURALLY MY LIVER IS PUTTING OUT GLUCOS WHEN IT NEEDS TO IN IT VERY STEADY AND GIVES ME PURE FOCUSS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT LUNCH AND JUST POUERING THROUGH AT DINNER II LOVE FOOD AS MUCH AS ANYBODY SO I WILL I WILL EAT A REGULAR PRETTY HEALTHY MEAL I'LL ET I'LL TRY TO MOSTLY VEGETABLES I CAN EAT SANE FISH AND SHRIM I REALLY WILL EAT IT A AS AKE I IN FACT MY MYCRO BY A IT'S SO ADAPTED TO MY DIET NOW IF I EAT A STAKE IT WILL NOT GET DIGESTED VERY WELL I'LL FEEL TERRIBLE IF I DON'T EAT A STAKE I FEEL TER AAH WELL WE ARGENTYIN LINEAGE BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT SO  WELL EVERYBODYS DIFFERENT  MEET THAT'S THE OTHER THING WHAT WHAT WORKS TO ME MAY NOT BE PERFECT FOR YOU AND WE DO AFE TO MEASURE THINGS TO KNOW WHAT'S WORKING A I REALLY  DESERT I GAVE UP DESERT AND SUGAR IN MY WHEN I TURN FORTY AND A OCCASIONALLY I'LL STEAL A BIT OF DESERT CAUSE IT DOESN'T HERD IF YOU STEAL IT RIGHT BUT OTHER THAN THAT I I AVOID SUGAR WHICH INCLUDES A SIMPLE COBA HYDRATES IM BREAD I TRY TO AVOID BUT ACTUALLY NOTICE TIS A AND JUST A SIDE NOT ASE TO GET BUILD UP A PLACK PRETTY EASILY AND EVERY TIME I WENT TO THE DENTIST THAT HAVE TO SCRAPE IT OFF AND I EVEN BORT TOOLS TO SCRAPE IT OFF CAS WAS DRIVING ME NOTS I DON'T GET PLACK ANY MORE AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF MY DIET I DON'T HAVE THOSE SUGARS IN MY MOUTH AT THE BACTERIA FEET ON AND THEN FORM THE BUY A FILM ON  TI MUCH BETTER BREATH BY THE WAY A ALL THAT'S AF BENEFIT ISHOULD DO YOU EVER FAST LONGER THAN THIS IT SOUNDS LIKE YO IF YOU AM IF YOU GO TO BED IT WELL USE TEN TO STAY UP LATE I KNOW BECAUSE I GAT TACS FROM YOU LIKE TWO IN THE MORNING THE AM MY TIME WHICH MEADS YOUR OUP VERY LATE AND UP EARLY AS WELL BUT ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP SOME TIME AROUND ELEVEN THIRTY OR TWELVE PLACER MANICE AN HOUR AND WAKE UP SOME TIME AROUND SEVEN A M PLACER MINUS NINETY MINUTES YOU'RE EATING MORE OR LAST ON A IT SOUNDS LIKE A SOM LIKE A TWENTY HOURS OF FASTING FOUR HOURS OF EATING OR SIXTEEN HOURS A FASTING AND EIGHT HOURS OF OF FOOD AND TAKE ET CETERA BUT DO YOU EVER DO LONGER FAST LIKE FORTY EIGHT HOURS OR SEVENTY TWO HOURS OR WEEK LONG FAST OCCASIONALLY I DO A SO MY TYMICAL DAY I I WOULD ONLY EAT WITHIN A TWO HOUR WINDOW JUST U SUALL I MEAT IT EITHER EATING HOUT OR ASSE YOUR TWENTY TWO TWO YE YERE I I LOVE WELL AND IF YOU EXERCISED YOU FEEL LIKE THEN YOU JUST POURS THROUGH AND MAINTAIN THAT FASTED STATE ABSOLUTELY I CAN EXERCISE AND NOW I BODY SO USED TO IT I DON'T FEEL LIKE A NEED FOOD OFFTER EXERCISING I USED TO I AN BUT HAVE I GONE LONGER YES BUT NOT VERY OFTEN I FIND IT QUITE DIFFICULT TO GO MORE THAN TWENTY FOR HOURS  BUT WHEN I DO IT MAY BEET'S ONCE A MONTH I'LL GO FOR TWO DAYS A OFTO TWO AND ACTUALLY EVEN BETTER IF YOU GO THREE DAYS WITHOUT EATING IT KICKS IN EVEN GREATER A LONGAVITY BENEFITS SO THERE'S A SYSTEM COLLD THE WHAT TOFAGI SYSTEM WHICH I JEST OLD AND MISFOLDED PROTINS IN THE BODY AND THERE'S A NATURAL CLEANSING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE HUNGRY I MACROATOFAGY ITS NAME IS BUT A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE A ANEMEREA CUARVAUX ATD ALL THUT IN STON COLDIA MEDICINE DISCOVERED A A DEEP CLEANS CALLED THE CHAPRON MEDIATED OR TOFAGI WHICH KICKS IN DAY TWO DAY THREE I WHICH REALLY GETS RID OF THE THE DEEP PROTINS AND WHAT WHAT EXCISES ME IS SHE JUST PUT OUT A A BIG PAPER THAT AD IF YOU TRIGGER THIS PROCESS IN AN IN AN OLD MOUSE IT LEAVES THIRTY FIVE PER CENT LONGER SO IT'S A BIG DEAL IF I COULD GO LONGER I WOULD BUT I JUST FIND THAT WITH MY LIFE STYLE AND I'M GOING ALWAYS DAY IN A HUNDRED TEN PER CENT  I NEED TO TO E AT LEAST ONCE A DAY AN FORSHAN WHAT MORE PRACTICAL QUESTION THAN A MECHANISTIC QUESTION RELATED TO THIS THE PRACTICAL QUESTION IS WHEN YOU ARE FASTING REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG I KNOW YOUR INJESTING FLUIDS LIKE WATER AND A PRESUMELY SOME CAFIN I HEARD YOU HAD SEVERAL OR MORE OR MORE EXPRESSER TO DAY A WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE BUT ARE YOU ALSO INJESTING ELECTROLIGHTS LIKE I KNOW SOME PEOPLE GET LIGHTHEADED THEY SAR TO FEEL SHAKY WHEN THEY FAST AAND THAT THE ADDITION OF SODIUM TO THEIR WATER OR PATASSIUM MANESIM A IS SOMETHING THAT'S BECOMING LITTLE MORE INVOGUE NOW IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU DO OR THAT YOU SEE A NEED FOR PEOPLE TO DO WELL IT MAKE SENSE  BUT IHAVENT HADN'T NEED TO DO IT SO I DON'T I JUST I DRING TO DURING THE DAY AN COFFEE WHEN I FIRST AWAY AND I DON'T GET THE SHAKS O YOU KOW I I DON'T FIX WHAT'S NOT BROKEN A AND I DO AD THINGS TO MY PROTO CALL THAT I THINK WILL IMPROVE ME  AND AVOID THOSE THINGS OF COURSE THE ON A BE IT BE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A NEED FOR TI DON'T TRY IT BUT IT DOES MAKE SENSE SPECIALLY IF YOU'VE HAD A BIG NIT THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU POBLY ONT A SUPPLEMENT WITH THAT BUT I I THINK THER'S THIS FERAMOUNT OF A GOOD STOFF IN T AN COFFEE AS IT IS  SO THEN TH THE MECHANISTIC QUESTION IS YOU'VE TOLD US THAT THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT KEEPING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LOW FOR A PERIOD OF TIME EACH TWENTY FOUR HOURS CAN HELP TRIGGER SOME OF THESE PRO LONGHEVITY ANTICING MECHANISMS AND THAT EXTENDING THEM OUT TWO OR THREE DAYS CAN TRIGGER YET ADDITIONAL MECHANISMS  OF ET GOBBLING UP OF OF DEAD SELL SOMETHINGS THAT SORT HOW IS IT THAT BLOOD GLUE COAST TRIGGERS THESE MECHANISMS CAUSE WEVE SAID I'LL GENT REMOVE GLUCOS AND THINGS GET BETTER A YOU'VE I TALK BEFORE ME WE COULD TALK MORE NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE UNDERLYING CELLER AND GENETIC MECHANISMS THINGS LIKE THE SURTUANS BUT HOW ARE GLUECOASTS AND THE SURTUINS ACTUALLY TETHER TO ONE ANOTHER MECHANISTICALLY IF THERE'S A REALLI OD QUESTION THAT PROVES YOUR SCIENTIST AORD WORDLY ON SO WHAT WE WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS THAT THESE LONGEVITY PATHWAYS WE CALL IN THESE LONGEVITY GENES TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WE USED TO SAY ALL MY LON JOTY GENES MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURS IT WAS RIDICULOUS CAUSE THE OLL TALKIN EACH OTHE YOU PULL ONE LEVER AND THE OTHER ONE MODS ND THE WAY TO THINK OF IT IS THAT THERE ARE SYSTEM SET UP TO DETECT WHAT YOU ARE EATING SO THE SORTUANS WILL MAINLY RESPOND TO SUGAR AND INSOLEN AND THEN THIS IS OTHER SYSTEM CALLED AM TOR WHICH IS SENSING HOW MUCH PROTINE OR A MENOASCENCE OF COMING INTO YOUR BODY AND THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER WE CAN PULL ONE AND FICT THE OTHER IN VISE VERSER BUT TO GATHER WHEN YOUR FASTING YOU'LL G ET THE SURTUIN ACTIVATION WHICH IS GOOD FOR YOU AND YOU YOU'LL ALSO THROUGH LACK OF A MENOACIDS PARTICULARLY THREE OF THEM LOOSING I SOLUCING VAILING THE BODY WILL DOWN REGULATE EMTOUR AND IT'S THAT OPSOR TO AND DOWN EM TOUR THAT IS HUGELY BENEFICIAL AN TURNS ON ALL OF THE BODY'S DEFENCES THE PRO CHEWING UP THE OLD PROTINES IMPROVING INSOLENCENSE TO BE GIVING US MORE ENERGY REPAIRING CELLS ALL OF THAT AND AND SO THESE TWO POTHWAYS I THINK OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FLONGEVITY SO INTERESTING YOU MENTION LOUSINE WITHIN THE RESISTANCE TRAINING SLASH BODY BUINGS LASH FITNESS COMMUNITY LOOSINE GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY'RE LONGSTANDING DEBATES ABOUT HOW MUCH PROTINE ONE NEEDS PERDAY AND HOW MUCH ONE CAN ASSIMILATE AT EACH MEAL IT MAKES FOR MANY YOU TO VIDIOS AND AND NOT MUCH ELSE FRANKLY HOWEVER IT'S CLEAR THAT BECAUSE OF LOSINE'S EFFECTS ON THE EMTOUR PATHWAY THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE NOT JUST PEOPLE IN THESE PARTICULAR FITNESS COMMUNTIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO INJEST MORE LOOSINE ON A REGULAR BASIS IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE THEIR WELLNESS AND FITNESS AND IN SOME CASES MUSCLE GROWTH BUT ALSO JUST WELLNESS BUT WHAT I INTERPRET YOUR LAST STATEMENT TO MEAN IS THAT LOOSINE BECAUSE IT TRIGGER CELLER GROWTH IS ACTUALLY PRO AGEHIM IN SOME SENSE IS THAT RIGHT WELL IT COULD BE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO THE DEBATE SHOULD YOU SUPPLEMENT WITH GROWTH HORMONO TISTOSTERON ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES WILL GIVE YOU IMMEDIATE BENEFITS YOU'LL YOU'LL BULK UP MORE YOU'LL FEEL BETTER IMMEDIATELY BUT BASED ON THE RESEARCH IT'S AT THE EXPENSE OF LONGTOM HEALTH SO MY VIEW OF LONGEVITY THE WAY I TREAT MY BODY IS I DON'T BURN BOTH CANDLES I HAVE ONE END OF THE CANDLE IT I A'M VERY CAREFUL I DON'T BLOW ON IT BUT I ALSO DO ENOUGH EXERCISE THAT I'M BUILDING UP MY MUSCLE BUT I'M I'M NOT HUGE ANY ONE WHO SEE MES IU KNOWS THAT I'M NOT A A PROFESSIONAL BODY BUILDER BUT I TRY T ACTUALLY HE'S THE CASE AND I HAVEN'T SAID THIS PUBLICLY THAT I CAN REMEMBER I PULSE THINGS SO THAT I GET PERIODS OF FASTING AND THEN I EAT THEN I TAKE A SUPPLEMENT THEN I FAST THEN I EXERCISE AND II'M TAKING THE SUPPLEMENTS AND EATING IN THE RIGHT TIMING TO ALLOW ME TO BUILD UP MUSCLE SOMETIMES BECAUSE YOU CONST JUST EXPECT TO TAKE SOMETHING CONSTANTLY AND DO SOMETHING CONSTANTLY FOR T TO WORK AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S TAKING ME ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS TO DEVELOP MY PROTICAL ND IS THIS LOT OF SUBTLETY TO HIM YET SOY A VERY RATIONAL PROTOCOL DOES THE NAME ORRY HOFMACLER MEANIITHING TO YOU NO OQUETT I JUST BRIEFLY A I DISCOVERED ORY HOFFMACLER ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO HE WAS A IN HIS RAILLY SPECIAL FORCES HE'S NOW GOT O BE CLOSE TO SEVENTY FORGIVE ME ORRY IF THACTS A THAT THAT NUMBER IS INFLATED AM HE WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE WARRIOR DIET WHICH GOT VERY LITTLE ATTENTION AT THE TIME BUT WHAT HE SAID WAS WHEN HE WAS IN IS RAILLY SPECIAL FORCES THEY RARELY ATE MORE THAN ONCE PER DAY AND SOMETIMES ONCE EVERY SECOND OR THIRD DAY AND THIS IS A GUOD WHO MAINTAINS IN INCREDIBLE FHYSICAL STATURE YER HE'S VERY LEAN VERY STRONG AND VERY VITAL AT YOU NO NT I WOULD SAY AN ADVANCED AGE BUT HE IS GETTING UP THERE AND HE JUST SEEMS TO BE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER ORRY HOFMACHLER WAS THE PERSON WHO ESSENTIALLY FOUNDED IF YOU WILL ALTHOUGH OUR ANCESTORS FOUNDED TO BE COMPLETELY FAIR THE SO CALLED INTERMITTENT FASTING DI HE CALLE IT THE WARRIOR DIED IN THIS BOOK DIN GET MUCH ATTENTION BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YU TO SAID REALLY REMINDEN ME OF OR E I SAT DOWN WITH HIM AS SHE WENT TO HIS HOME AND SAT DOWN WITH HIM AND HE SAID FASTING IS WONDERFUL BUT THESE PULSES WHERE YOU NOURISH THE BODY OR EVEN SLIGHTLY OVER NOURISH THE BODY PROVIDED THEY ARE TOO FREQUENT HAVE A TREMENDOUS EFFECT ON VITALITY AND SI I WONT TO USE THAT AS KIND OF A SAG WAY TO A ADDRESS THIS ISSUE A VITALITY VERSES LON GAVITY BECAUSE HERE YOURS TELLING ME AND CERTAINLY THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THAT YOU GROTHORMON WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER AND YOUNGER TAKING TESTOSTRON OR ESTRGON WE SHOULD PROBABLY SAY THERE ARE RIGHT WOMEN WHO AAVE TAKE CORMONTERAPIES LATER IN LIFE WOU TAKE ESTRICHIN THEY EXPERIENCE A STRONG INCREASE IN VITALITY IF IT'S DONE CORRECTLY BUT THERE IS IT AN EFFECT OF AGING THE BODY MORE RAPIDLY IT SORT OF A SECOND PUBRITY IF YOU WELL BUT THIS IDEA OF RESTRICTION AND T HEN PULSING NOT NECARILY FEAST AND FAMINE BUT CERTAINLY FAMINE AND FEAST IN LOWER CASE LETTERS REALLY THERE REALLY SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SO AT A SELLER LEVEL LIKE WE CON GO BACK TO EMTOUR IN THE SURTUANS HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THE CELLS MIGHT BE REACTING TO THIS KIND OF LOWER CASE FEAST A AND UPPER CASE FAMINE TYPPROTICAL I A WELL THE THE PULSING I THINK IS WHAT YOU WANTO TO IS TO GET THE CELLS TO BE PERCEIVING ADVERSITY A COSOUR MODERN LIFE WYS SITTING ROUND WERE EATING TOO MUCH A WERE NOT EXERCISING OURSELVES RESPOND DE GOHAY EVERYTHING'S COOL NO PROBLEM AND THEY BECOME RELAX IN THEIR INTURN ON THE DEFENCES AND WE AGE RAPIDLY WE CAN SEET IN THE CLOCK PEOPLE WO EXERCISE AND EAT LESS HAVE A SLOWE TICKING CLORKS IT'S A FACT A BUT MY PROTOCAL IS DIFFERENT THAN MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE I IM PULSING IT NOW THE FESSELL LET'S GET TO WHY DID I EVEN THINK THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE CAUSE I DIDN'T READ THE WARRIOR DIET A WHAT I FOUND IN MY RESEARCH WAS THAT IF WE GAVE OR IS VERETRAL THIS RED WINE MOLECULE THAT BECAME WELL KNOWN IN THE TWO THOUSANDS A IF WE GAVE IT TO MY THEI WHOLE LIFE SPEN THEY WERE PROTECTED AGAINST A HIGH FACT DIET WHICH WE CALL THE WESTERN DIET THEY HAD LEAN ORGANS THEY LIVE SLIGHTLY LONGER BUT NOT A LOT AND IF WE GAVE THEM A HIGH FACT IE WITHOUT REVERTRAL THEY ACTUALLY YOUN LIVED WHAT SORE SO IS VIRTUAL PROTECTED THEM AGAINST THE HIGH FAT DIET WE GAVE IT TO THE MON A NORMAL DIET THAT YOU STAT IT WHEN THEY WANTED AND THERE WASN'T MUCH EFFECT THIS IS WHAT'S NOT KNOWN THOUGH IT'S IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL DATA OF THE PAPER THAT NOBODY EVER READS THE MICE THAT WE GIVEN RESVERTRAL EVERY SECOND DAY ONA NORMAL DIET LIVE DRAMATICALLY LONGER THAN ANY OTHER GROUP SO PEOPLE OUT THERE YOU KNOW MY MY CRITICS SAY ALWAYS VERTRAL DIDN'T EXTEND THE LIFE SPAN O MY SON A NORMAL DIET THEREFORE IT'S NOT AGING ITS JUST PROTECTING AGAINST THE HIGH FAT DIET WELL LOOK AT THE SUPPLEMENTAL DATA PLEASE IF YOU GIVE IT TO THE MICE EVERY OTHER DAY WE HAD MYE LIVING OVER THREE YEARS WELL THT'S A LONG TIME R I HAVE GOT MANY MANY MICE IN MY A ONLY A OWNERSHIP THAT AND MY LABID S TAMPER AND THAT'S A VERY LONG LIFE FOR AMOUT IT WAS BY FAR AND SO IT WAS A LONG LIVE SPAN EXTENSION AND WHAT THAT TOLD ME IS THAT PROBABLY YOU DON'T WANTO BE TAKING A SUPPLEMENT EVERY DAY YOU CAN TAKE IT EITHER EVERY OTHER DAY OR GIVE YOUR BODY ARREST AND I DO THE SAME WITH MY MEALS I REST DURING THE DAY ANDTHEN I GIVE A NUTRICIOUS DINNER TO MY BODY AND THEN GIVE YOURREST SAY WETVE EXERCISE AND THATI TRY TO TIME IT WAS THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I'M TAKING THE DRUG MET FOREMAN WHICH ME MIXE LOW ENERGY FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNO METFORMAN AS A DRUG GIVEN TO TYPED YOU DIBETICS TO BRING DOWN THEIR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS BUT IT'S BEEN FOUND THAT LOOKING AT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BETERANS AND OTHERS THAT THOSE TWO TOUCH Y DIBETICS LIVE LONGER THAN PEOPLE THAT DON'T EVEN GET TYPEY DIBEDS SO IT'S A LONGEVITY DRUG RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO GET IT FROM YOUR DOCTOR IN THE UES AND MOST OUT OF COUNTRIES YOU CAN JUST GET IT OVER THE COUNTER AND YOU PROTECT IT IT LOOKS LIKE BASED ON EPBEDYMOLOGICAL DATA A CANSE OR HARD DISEASE FRAILTY  WHAT ELSE TO MENSURE SO I TAKE MET FOREMAN INADDITIO YOU TAKE METFORMAN AN YOUR FASTING EACH DAY SO WHEN DO YOU TAKE ITR RELATIVE TO THE FACT I I ALWAYS TAKE A MET FORMAN IN THE MORNING ALONG WITH THEE ISVERTRAL A BECAUSE FOR NUMBER O REASONS BUT MAINLY BECAUSE MY BODY RESPONDSE BETTER AND I BEE MEASUREN MY BODY FOR TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS BUT HE'S THE THING IF IAM GOING TO EXERCISE A THAT DAY I WILL SKIP THE MAT FORMAN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WHO DO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS THIS KIND OF THING THINK THAT THEY SHOULD STOP TAKING ET FORMAN CAUSE THEY NEVER CAN A GET MUSCLE OR ITSCENNAT FACT THERE ABILITY TO BUILD UP MUSCLE BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE WHAT MET FORMAN DOES TO IT ACTUALLY JUST REDUCES THE OBURABILITY TO HAVE STAMMINA BECAUSE IT'S INHIBITING YOUR BODI'S ABILITY TO MAKE ENERGY A AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOUARE MET FORMAN YOU DO FEWAR RETS BUT GUESS WHAT THOSE MUSCLES THAT YOU DO BUILD UP ON MET FOREMAN HAVE THE SAME STRENGTH AND HAVE MUCH LOWER INFLAMMATION AND OTHER MARKES OF AGING YOU JUST WON'T HAVE THAT EXTRAFIVE PER CENT SIZE OF MUSCLES SO IF YOU WANT LARGE MUSCLES DON'T TAKE MET FOREMAN AND YOU'LL BE FINE DURING YOUR EXERCISE H BUT FOR ME ID I'M NOT TRYING TO GET GIAN I ONCE STRONG MUSCLES AND I WANTE LIVE LONGER IN HEALTHIER SO I I JUST TRY O TIME IT SO THAT I GET THE MOST RAPS OUT OF MY EXERCISE RAGINE AH BUT SOMETIMES IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IT'S WORTH BRINGING THIS UP IF THERE'S A FIVE PER CENT DIFFERENCE IN A GRAPH THEN EITHER THE PRESSRELESE OR SOME REPORTABLE SAY O MY GOODNESS BIG DIFFERENCE FIVE PER CENT CONTAKE MET FORMING DURING EXERCISE THAT'S THE HEADLINE AND IN GO IN AND IT'S BAILY SIGNIFICAND AND THE GRATH IS DISTORTED BECAUSE THEY'VE CHANGED THE AXES TO MAKE IT LOOK BIGGER AND YOU KNOW NOW IT'S BECOME AMIT THAT MET FORMAN GREATLY INHIBITS RABILITY TO EXERCISE WHICH IS NOT TRUE BUT IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION I I SKIP MY MET FORMAN ON DAYS ON AN EXERCISE AND NOT ONLY THAT I'M ONE OF THE TWENTY PERCENTOF PEOPLE THAT HAS A STOMACH SENSITIVITY TO IT SI IF I'M NOT FEELING GREAT THAT DADN' TAKE IT EITHER YOU MENTION MAT FORMAN IS AVAILABLE ONLY BY PRESCRIPTION FROM A DOCTOR AT LEAST IN THE YOU S AM BERBERINE AS THI SUBSTANCE THAT COMES FROM TREE BARKER I ALSO LEARNED ABOUT MANY YEARS AGO FROM ORY A HE SAID IF EVER I'M GOING TO OVER EAT LIKE A THANKSGIVING MEAL OR SOMETHING I TAKE BERBERING  THIS WAS HTHOSE WERE HIS WORDS AND I TRIED AND WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT BERBERINE IS THAT A YOU CAN EAT ENORMOUS QUANTITIES OF FOOD AND NOT FEEL AS IF YOU'VE EATEN ENORMOUS QUANTITIES OF FOOD I'M NOT NECESSARILY RECOMMENDING PEOPLE DO THIS BUT WHAT I NOTICE WAS IF I TOOK BERBERINE WHICH MYNERSENTI IS IT WORKS VERY SIMILARLY TO TO MAT FOREMEN WORSE ON THE MPIQUE PATHWAY THE UMTOR PATHWAY ET CETERA THAT IF I DIDN'T INJEST FOOD IN PARTICULAR CARBOHYDRATES I WOULD FEEL A LITTLE DIZZY AN CON TO GET A HEAD ACHE LIKE ALMOST HIPOGLISEMAC WHAT AE YOUR THOUGHTS ON BERBERIN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MAT FOREMEN AND ARE THERE ANY CAUTIONARY NOTES I'M NOBVOUSLY PEOPLE SHOULD TALK TOR THEIR DOCTOR BEFORE ADDING OR SUBTRACTING ANYTHING FROM THEIR LIFE INCLUDING AM A BRATHWORKER ANYTHING THAT ONT THAT COMES UP BUT WITH ALL THAT AS SET ASIDE WHAT RE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT BERBERING AND A TIMING OF OF LOW BLOOD SUGAR AND AN THESE SORTS OF THINGS I WELL BEFORE I HAD ACCESS TO MAT FOREMAN I WAS TAKING BERBERING IT'S IT'S OFTEN KNOWN AS THE PORMAN'S METFOREMAN U THAT HE JUST CALLED ME POOR WHAT WT WOMEN CAN TAKE IT TO A SO THAT THE THING WITH BUGGERING WE STURDED IN MY LAB IT IT IS EFFECTIVE AT BOOSTING ENERGETICS IN THE BODY JUST LIKE A  PICE I'M AT FOREMAN DOES AH AND WE'VE ACTUALLY GIVEN TO RATS AND AND MY SINCSEEING THAT THEY ARE VERY HEALTHY SPECIALLY ON A HIGH FAT DIDE SO I I THINK IT'S IT'S LIKELY TO BE GOOD THERE ARE SOME HUMAN STUDIES THAT EXIST CLINICAL TRIALS SHOWING THAT IT INCREASES IN SELENC SENSTIVITY EFE TO TAKE HIGH DOTICES WHICH IS A GOOD THING  YEA I THINK MY PEOPLE YOUARE INSOLENT SENSITIVITIES SOMETIMES EOPLE THINK OH ELL TAT THAT'S BAD RIGHT KNOW YOU WANT YOURSELVES TO BE INSOLENT SENSITIVE YOU DON'T WANT A LOT OF BLOOD SUGAR FLOATING AROUND THE CAMP BE SURQUASTERED INTOSELVS EXACTLYUE SO THIS IS ANTI TYPE TO DI BEES AND SO THAT THIS BURBERING I DOES HAVE WONDERFUL EFFECTS ON THE METABOLISM OF ANIMALS AND IN SOME CLINICAL TRIALS ON DOZENS OF PEOPLE IT'S BEEN TESTED NOW THERE'S THERE'S ONE CAUTIONARY TALE WHICH JUST CAME UP MET CABELINES LAD PUBLISH THA BURGERING REDUCE THE LIFE SPANIF WORMS  BUT I'M NOT SORE WORMS TRUMP HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS AT THIS POINT SO NO  NOT IN MY OPI WOUL MU NO DIST RESPECT TO MY SE ELLEGANCE COLLEAGUES FOR  RATHER MY COLLEAGUES THAT WORE CONCEAL YER BET THAT WHAT I LIKE TO DO AS TO GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION PEOPLE CAN DECIDE WHAT THEY ON BUT I WOULD SAY BASE ON THE WORN DATE I WOULDN' PANIC JUST YET I THINK BURGERING HAS BEEN SHUN WE REALLY SAFE IN HUMANS YOU MENTION REST ORATRALL THINK I NOWD BE A GREAT TIME TO TALK LOWBIT ABOUT PROTOCALLS FOR REST RARTRAL GRAT SEED EXTRACT ET CETERA I LET'S START WITH THA THE OBVIOUS ONE THAT I I KNOW YOU GET A LOT BUT I'M FOR THE RECORD CAN'T I JUST DRINK RED WINE AND GET ENOUGH RES RRTROLL DAVEN YOU CAN TRY YOU YOU NEED TO DRINK ABOUT TWO HUNDRED GLASSES A DAY SO I IHURE IT'S BEEN TRIED THERE ARE SOME AND I I DRINK IT A GLOSS OF RED WINE A DAY F I GET THE CHANCE BUT ANY MORE THAN THAT IT'S LOT OF CALERIES AND YOUR LIVER WILL GET FATTY AND IT'S ALL TAT SO IT WE REALISTICALLY YOU CAN ONLY GET THE THOUSAND MILEGRAMS THAT I TAKE A DAY A FROM A SUPPLEMENT THAT'S PURE NOWTHEREREA LOT OF PEOPLE SELLINGWERS VERATRALL IF IT'S NOT LIGHT GRAY OR WHITE IN IN COLOR THROW IT AWAY THE BROWN STUFF HAS GONE BAD BORE IS CONTAMINATED AND THE CONTAMINATE ISTOFF BEWAREIT CAUSED IREA  BUT REREGULAR AS VERTRALS SHOULD NOT DO THAT SO A THOUSAND MILEGRAMS PERDAYS WHAT YOU DO YEN I HAV FOR OR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS NOW AND YOU IN JEST THAT WITH SOME FATTY SUBSTANCE LIKE ALL OF OYAL OR YOGER IS I RIGHT YR YOU HAVE TO AND OW THE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS COURSEITEN CIRKUMEN THESE THESE ARE CRUNCHY THINGS THAT IS NOT GING TO GET THROUGH YOU GUT AND I'M NOT JUST MAKING THIS UP A I ALWAYS BASE MIGHT STATEMENTS ON HUMAN STUDIES SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF STUDIES ON RESVERTRALL AS IF OTHERS SINCE AND WE KNOW THAT FROM WE FOUND OUT EARLY I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO TAKE A HIGH DOTES FOR HIS VERTRAL AND WAY WHEN WE INCLUDED IT WITH FOOD THE LEVELSAND MY BLOOD WENT OUT FIVEFOLD AND SO YOU WANTO HAVE SOMETHING IN THERE IF YOU JUST DRINK IT WITH WATER ITS NOCKING TO GET THROUGH AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE HAVE DONE CLINICAL TRIALS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING THAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO DISSOLVEED IN SOMETHING SO YOU ARE YOU TAKING THIS ALL AT ONCE IN THE MORNING AND CHASING IT WITH SOME ALL OF OYAL OR YOU A DISSOLVING AT ANY OGER WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE SPECIFIC PROTICAL YE I IVE BEIN IMPROVING PERFECTING WHAT I DO FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS I WOULD TAKE SOME GREEK YOGER COUPLE OF SPOONFULS PUT THE RESVRTROL ON THERE MAKES IT AROUND MAKE SHORTST IS OLD AND PUT THAT IN MY MOUTH IN SFUL OF THAT THESE DAYS WHAT I LIKE TO DO BECAUSE I'VE REALIZE THAT OLIVOIL AND PARTICULARLY ALAKE ACID ONE OF THE MONET O UNSETURATE OF FADIACIDS IS ALSO AN ACTIBATOR OF THE SURTUIN DEFENCES SO I'M TRYING I IN JEST MORE OF OLAK ACID SO I SWITCH TO OLIVOIL WHAT I DO AS I PUT COUPLE OF TEASPOONS OF OLIVOIL IN A GLASS MIX AROUND THERE ISVERTROL AND MAY BE SOME CROSI CROSITIN A SIMILAR MOLCULE MAKE HORST IS OLD I PUT A LITTLE BIT OF VINEGAR A AND IF I HAVE A BASLELY IL PUT THAT IN AND 'S LIKE DRINKING SOME ASALA DRESSING IN ITS GRAT DELICIOUS A THAT RAISES A QUESTION THAT I WON'T ASK BEFORE WE GET TO ANAMAN AND AN ARE INVITEMEN BE THREE WHICH IS BY DOING THAT DO YOU THINK THAT IT BREAKS YOUR FAST AND I WANT I JUST FRAME THIS QUESTION OF BREAKING THE FAST IN IT IN A MORE GENERAL SCIENTIFIC THEME AND I LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GET ASK ALL THE TIME IS DOES IN JESTING BLANK BREAK THE FAST DOES EATING THIS OR DRINKING THAS COFFEE YOU KNOW IF I WALK IN THE ROOM AN SOME ONE ELSE IS EATING A CRACKOR DOES IT BREAK MY FAST YE PEOPLE GET PRETTY EXTREME WITH THIS MY SENSE AND PLEASE TELL ME IF I'M WRONG O MY SENSE IS THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU DID THE NIGHT BEFORE WHETHER NOT YOUR DIBETIC LOTS OF THINK SO FOR INSTANCE OF I EAT AN ENORMOUS MEAL AT MIDNIGHT GO TO SLEEP WAKE UP AT SIX A M I COULD IMAGIN THAT BLACK COFFEE OR COFFEE WITH A LITTLE BUT A CREE MIHT QUOT AN COP BREAK MY FAST BUT THE BODY DOESN'T HAVE A BRAKING THE FAST SWITCH THE BODY ONLY SPEAKS IN THE LANGUAGE OF GLUE COS A M PQU M TOUR ET CETERA SO DO YOU WORRY THAT IN JESTING THESE CALLORIES IS GOING TO CORTINCL BREAK YOUR FAST AND MORE GENERALLY HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF WEATHER NOT YOUR FASTING ENOUGH TO GET THESE PAS INF A FACTS BECAUSE I NOT EVERYBODY CAN MANAGE ON JUST WATER OR JUST TE OR I UWE SHOULD SAY NOT EVERYBODY IS WILLING TO MANAGE ON JUST WATER OR JUST FOR CERTAIN PART OF THE DAY WELL MY FIRST ANSWER IS NOT SCIENTIFIC IT'S PHILOSOPHICAL IF YOU DON'T ENJOY LIFE WHAT'S THE POINT AND SO I'D I'D LIKE A COUP OF COFFEE IN THE MORNING LITTLE BIT OF MILK SPOONFUL OF YOURGETS NOK IN A KILL ME I OLIVOIL DOESN'T HAVE PROATINE OR CARBS IN IT NOT MANY AND SO I'M PROBABLY NOT AFFECTING THOSE SLUNGE EFY PATHWAYS NEGATIVELY I BUT WITHOUT THAT FITTLE I WOULDN'T ENJOY MY LIFE AS MUCH SECKWELL THET OLIVOIL IS'T IS NOT AS GREAT AS THE OGET BUT I'M TRYNG TO OPTIMIZE AND THERE'S NO PERFECT SOLUTION TO WHAT WE DOING AND WE STILL LEARNING WE DON'T KNOW IT'S ILL TALK TO MOLFOME LET ALONE EVERYBODY ELSE BUT I I'M WITH YOU I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TAKING A COUPLE OF SPOONFULS OF SOMETHING UNLESS IT'S HI FROTOS CONSIR IS GON A HURT YOU BECAUSE I'VE NOW GOT THE REST OF THE DAY TILL ABOUT EIGHT NINE P M OF NOT EATING ANYTHING AND THAT  I I FORGIVE MYSELF FOR THAT AND THAT THERE'S A REALY GOD POINT HERE YOU AND I WERE DISCUSSING THIS EARLIER I THE POINT ABOUT DOING THIS IS THAT YOU TRY TO DO YOUR BEST IF IF YOU GO FROM REGULAR LIVING TO DON'T EAT THE WHOLE DAY YOU CAN'T FAIL LIKE QUITTING SMOKING COLD TURK IT'S EASYE TO TRUE GARMENTS TO THE PATCH ON WHICH YOU BODY HAS TO GET USED TO ALL SORTS OF HABITS AND IT'S SOCIAL IT'S PHYSICAL PUTTING STUFF IN YOUR MOUTH CHEWING NOT JUST THE LORD BLOODSHUER LEVELS AND YOUR BRAIN WILL FIGHT IT YOUR LIMBIC SYSTEM IS GIN A GO HEY DO IT DO IT DO IT AND YOU CAN HAVE TO FIGHT IT ONCE BUT WONT YOU GET THROUGH IT YOU'LL BE BETTER BUT YOU DO IT IN STAGES DO BREAKFAST FIRST THEN DO SMALL LUNCH AND EVENTUALLY CUT LUNCH OUT DON'T GO CULTUGBECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S A FACT THAT IF YOU TRY TO DO A STRICT DIIT RIGHT OUT OF THE GATES YOU'LL ALMOST ALWAYS FAIL I THINK IM THAT CAPTURES TA THE ASSENCE OF OF THE FASTING RATIONALLY IN IRRATIONAL APPROACH TO IT TO SUPPLEMENTATION VERY WELL ALONG THE LINES OF SUPPLEMENTATION WHAT ABOUT AN M AND AND AR AND BE THREE NISON WHAT HOW DOES ANE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU DO I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO LIK AND I THINK MOST WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD DO EN THESE ARE MOLECULES THAT IMPACT THE SURTUIN PATHWAY IN PACT THA THE PATHWAYS THAT CONTROL AGING E RATES OF AGING IN THE APICE KNOW HOW DO THEY DO THAT AND HOW DOES WANT INCORPORATE THAT IN TO IT A SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCAL SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT ALL RIGHT WELL DISCLAIMER IS A I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYTHING BUT I TALK ABOUT WHAT I DO I SO BIT OF SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND THESE SIRTUANGENES THAT WE DISCOVERED FIRST IN YE SELLS WE KNOWS IT IN MY TE AND THEN NA INANIMALS AS I MOVE TO HARVARD IN THE TWO THOUSANDS I'M AND ONE OF ONE OF MY FIRST POST OX ACTUALLY LITERALY MY FIRST POSTOC IME COIN PUBLISHED A GREAT PAPER JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND FOUND THAT TURNING ON THE SIRTUAN SIXTEN MEMBY THE SEVEN N BUT SIXTENE IS VERY PODENT IT EXTENDED THE LAST PANDRAMATICALLY OF MICE THAT HE ENGINEERED BOTH MAILES AND FEMALES WHICH IS GREAT SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS SO NATURALLY BOOST THE ACTIVITY OF THESE SIRTUINS THEY ARE GENES BUT THE ALSO MAKE PROTINES THAT'S WHAT GENES TYPICALLY MAKE  R INCORD AND THEN THOSE PROACHINGS TAKE CARE OF THE BODY IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AS WE'VE DISCUSSED SO HOW DO YOU TURN ON THESE GENES AND MAKE THE PROTINES THEY MAKE EVEN MORE ACTIVE YOUR RIVE UP THAT SISEN SO EXERCISE WILL DO IT FASTING WILL DO IT WHAT ABOUT SUMPLEMENTATION WHILE THE FIRST ACTIV ATOR ALL THE SURTUINS THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT ACTS ON THE ENDS I'M TO MAKE IT DO A BETTER JOB IF CLEANING UP THE BODY IN PROTECTING WAS THE RESVERTRAL WE LOOKED AT THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT MOLECULES EVENTUALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS AND THE ONE THAT WAS THE BEST WAS RESVERTRAL IN THE DITION THAN WE GAVE IT TO LITTLE ORGANISMS WORMS AND THEN A FLIES IN MICE VENTUALLY HUMANS I WE STORE THAT IT ACTIVATED THAT INSIN SO RES VERTRAL IS ONE WAY TO ACTIVATIT YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS THE ACCELERATE A PEDAL ON A CAR IT REBS IT UP BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT THE SIRTULONES NEED TO WORK AND THAT'S AN AD ANADIS A REALLY SMALL MOLECULE LITTLE CHEMICAL IN THE BODY THAT WE NEED FOR LIFE IT'S USED BY THE BODY FOR CHEMICAL REACTIONS FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT REACTIONS IN THE BODY IN WITHOUT IT YOUR DEAD WITHIN SECONDS YOU NEED AN AD THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE SEEIN IS THAT ANYDY LEVELS DECLINE AS YOU BECOME OR BES AS YOU GET OLDER  IF YOU DON'T EVER GET HUNGRY  AND THE BODY NOT ONLY DOESN'T MAKE ENOUGH OF IT IT'S SHEWING IT UP AS WELL THERE IS AN ENDSIN CALLED SEEDY THIRTY EAD THAT ERIC VERDEN OWEVER A YOU SE AS E SHOWED CHOOSE UP OWASN OW THE BUCKINS ISSU IN CALIFORNIA CHOOSE UP AN AD AS YOU GET OLDER SUCH A DOUBLE WAM YOU DON'T MAKE AS MUCH CHEW IT UP WHICH IS REALLY BAD BECAUSE WHAT WE SHOWN IN MY LAB AND SO OF OTHERS IS THAT ANY DE LEVELS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR KEEPING THOSE OR TWO IN DEFENCES AD USEFUL LEVEL AND YOU CAN GIVE A LOT OF AS VERTRAL BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUEL YOUR ONLY YOU PYSICALL ACCELERATING A CORLOR DOESN'T AMN OF GAS S YOU WONT TO DO BOTH AND THAT'S WHAT I DO I TAKE A PRECURSER TO AN  CALLED N AMEN AND THE BODY USES THAT TO MAKE BE AN AD MOLECULE IN ONE STEP AND SO I KNOW FROM MEASURING DOZENS OF HUMAN BEINGS THT IF YOU TAKE AN AMEN FOR THE TIME PERIOD THAT I DO I'V BEEN TAKEN IF HE IS BUT IF YOU TAKE IT FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS YOU'LL DOUBLE ON AV REDOUBLE YOUR AN AD LEVELS IN THE BLOOD AY THAT'S NOT PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT'S FROM CLIMICAL TROUBLS THAT ARE NOT YET PUBLISHED OR THE LAST TWO YEARS  THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO INCREASE IN AD LEVELS IN SOME ONE LIKE ME WHO IS GETTING OLDER FIFTY TWO NOW  YOU CAN TAKE N R WHICH IS USED TO MAKE AN A MEN WHICH IS USED TO MAKE IN AD AN BOTH AN AMEN AN AN OUR SOUL BY COMPANIES A IN THE US  AN OUR IS LACKS THE PHOSPHATE A FOSPATES OF SMALL CHEMICAL THE BODY NEEDS PROBABLY HEARD OF THE ATOM PHOSOPHERUS I LET'S GO BACK ONE STEP HAD YOU MAKE AN AR AN AR GETS MADE FROM VITEMEN BE THREE OFTEN I YOU AN ALSO FIND IT IN MILK ANOTHER FOODS BUT SOMETIMES YOU PILLASK ME WHON DON'T YOU JUST TAKE VITEM IN BE THREE AND WON'T THAT JUST FORCE THE BODY TO MAKE AN D AND THE ANSWER IS NO IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL WE KNOW THIS JUST BY DOING THE EXPERIMENT BUT THE REASON I THINK IS IS THAT ANAD IS A IS A I SAID IT'S A SMALL MOLECULE BUT RELATIVE TO IVITEM IN BE THREE IT'S BE G IT'S GOT THOSE FOSPHATES ON THERE IT'S GOTTISH SUGAR A IT'S GOT THE NTHE BIDEMEN B ATTACHED SEE WHAT ALTHYS COMPONENTS THAT COME TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS VERY COMPLICATED LITTLE MOLECULECLED ANA D AND YOU WHEN YOU GIVE ANAMEN IT CONTAINS ALL THREE COMPONENTS THAT THE BODY NEEDS TO MAKE AN AD IF YOU GIVE AN AR OR JUST BY TOM AN BE THREE WHICH IS AN EVEN SMALLER MOLECULE THE BODY HAS TO FINE THESE OTHER COMPONENTS FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE SO WED YE GET FOSPAT WELL BODY NEEDS IT FOR D NA NEEDS IT FOR BONS SO HIH DOSES OR SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL PHOSPHATE A MAKES ME A LITTLE CONCERN AND WE HAVE COMPARED ANEMEN AN AN OUR HEAD TO HEAD IN MOUSE STUDIES A FOR INSTANCE AN ANEMEN WEVE SHOWN IN A SOLL PAPER FOR USICER MAKES MICE RUN FURTHER OLD MICE CAN RUN FIFTY PER CENT FOR LOOK AS THEY BETTER BLOOD FLOD BETTER ENERGY IN AR THE SAME DOSE DID NOT DO THAT INFACTIT HAD NO EFFECT I SEE BUT DOSAGE WISE IF I WERE ELECT TO TAKE ANAMAN AN SUPPLEMENT FORM TO INCREASE MY ANY D LEVELS AND PRESULY SLOW MY AGING HOW MUCH ENEAMEN SHOULD I TAKE WHAT'S THE PROTOCAUL THAT YOU DO AM AND ARE THE VARIOUS FORMS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE SOME BETTER OR SOME WORSE WELL I'M ALWAYS HAVING TO TELL YOU WHAT I DO IN WHAT MY FATHER DOES MY EIGHTY TO YOUR OLD FATHER WE WE TAKE A GRAH OF AN AMAN EVERY DAY SUCH A GRAMMARVERSFOR AT ALL AND A GRAHAM YO AN AMAN RIT O A THOUSAND MOGERS NOW ANOTHER ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS I'M NOT THE SAME AS EVERYBODY ELSE I'VE DIFFEREN MY COMBIM AGE SEX I AND SO I HAVE BEE MEASURING MYSELF A AND SO I KNOW IF SOMETHINGS OR I THINK I KNOW OF SOMETHING'S MAKING ME BETTER OR WORS BASED ON MEASURING FORTY FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS SO JUST WANT TO BE A PEOPLE TO BEAWARE THAT WHAT I DO MAY NOT PERFECTLY OR WORK AT ALL FOR OTHERS BUT I HAVE STUDIED AS I SA DOZANDS OF PEOPLE WO TAKE ANAMAN AT A GRAM SOMETIMES TWO GRAMS AND I KNOW BY LOOKING AT ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS THAT IF YOU DO WHAT I DO YOUR ANADY LEVELS COT UP BY ABOUT TWO FOLD OR MORE A AND SO I DO THAT EVERY DAY THE THOUSAND MILEGRAMS NOW PEOPLE SELL IT I I NEVER GET IN TO BRANDS AN ALL THAT FIRST OF ALL IDON' HAVE THE TIME TO MEASURE PRODUCTS I DON'T KNOW TH I SHOULD SAY I DO ONE TO SAY I AM WORKING ON A SOLUTION FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT'S REAL AND WHAT ISN'N BUT I'M NOT THERE YET AND IN THE MEANTIME I WOULD SAY IF YOU DO WANE OA BIDE THIS LET'S SAYO ONE TABITE AN AMAN LOOK FOR A COMPANY THAT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT HAS HIGH LEVELS OF QUALITY CONTROL LOOK FOR THREE LETTERS G M P WHICH IS A GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES AND SO IT MEANS THEY MAKE IT UNDER CERTAIN LEVEL OF QUALITY CONTROL YOU NOT AN A FINE IRON FILINGS IN THERE AND IT PROBABLY HAS THE STOCK IN IT THAT THEY SAY IT DOES  BUT SO THAT THAT'S THE THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY RIGHT NOW IA SURENLE SOMETHING IS TO BE MUCH MORE HEALPFUL BUT I OVER ALL MAKE SHORTS WHITE CRYSTALLINE AN A MAN AND T T TO ME IT TASTE LIKE BURNT POCKCON YOU CRACK OPEN THE CAPSILS AND YOU TAKE A LITL SAMPLE TO MAKE SURE TASTE LIKE BORK POCKOR WELL WHEN I WHEN I'M MAKING MY CAPTALS ALL TASTE IT AND A I DO LET A CALITY CONTROL IN THE STUFF THAT I TAKE DO YOU TAKE THAT GRAHNM ALL AT ONCE WITH THE RESFORAT ALLD O YOU TAKE IT SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT'S A ALL IN THE MORNING FOR THE FOR THOSE THINGS SO IT'S THA IT'S IF I TAKE MY FORMAND IT'S ANA MAN IN THERE ISVERTRAL ALTOGETHER AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT I IT'S ALL SCIENTIFIC I TRY TO BE I THE LEVELS OF ANYDY GO UP IN THE MORNING IN OUR BODIES NATURALLY OUR BODYES ACTUALLY HAVE A CYCLE OF ANYTY IT'S NOT STEADY IT'S CIRCADIAN IT'S ECADIAN IN FACT ANYDY CONTROLS YOUR CLOCK THIS WAS SHOWN BY SHIN AND I AND COLLEAGUES AND AS NICE SIGNCE PAPER AT A DECADE AGO THAT IF YOU DESTRUPT THE ANADY CYCLE WHICH IS CONTROLL BY THE CIRTUAN GEN THAT WE WORKED ON THAT IS WHAT'S TELLING YOUR BODY OH IT'S TIME TO EAT IT'S TIME TO GO TO SLEEP AND IF YOU TAKE THES THE ANY MAN LATE AT NIGHT FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN DESRUPT YOUR CIRCADIAN WEHEMS INTERESTING CONVERSELY WHEN I TRAVEL AND I WANT A RESET MY CLOCK TO THE TIMES ON I WILL TAKE A BOOSE I OF ANY MAN IN THE MORNING AND I FEEL RIGHT DOES IT THIS PROTO CALL FOR YOU OM DOES IT PRODUCE IM ANY IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF INCREASED ENERGY ET CETERA YOU MENTION IT THAT IM ONE WOULD IF IT'S RIGHT FOR THEM WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS TO START TO SEE THE ANADY LEVELS INCREASE AT THAT POINT WHEN A ANYDY LEVELS INCREASE I'M COOLD ONE POSSIBLY EXPECT AN INCREASE IN OVER ALL ENERGY FOCUS ET CETERA U I REALIZE WERE NOT MAKING PROMISES HERE BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER NOT THE ONLY MEASURE OF WHETHER NOT THIS PROTOCOLL IS WORKING IS WHETHER NOT YOU DIE AT AGE BLANK OR BLANK PLUSS TWENTY AND OF COURSE ONCE THAT YOU KNOW ONCE YOUR DEAD YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY KNOW IF YOU WOULD HAVE LIVED LONGER IF YOU DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY AND VICE VERSE SOR WR THAT THERE AS A STUDY AGAIN BY SHIN AN I MY GOOD FRIEND AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN SAINT LOS THAT OM SHOWD THAT IMPROVES REMEMB THIS INSOLENT SENSITIVITY I WHICH IS A GOOD THING SO BUT YOU CAN'T KNOW YOUR INSELLENT CENTIVITY UNLESS YOUR MEASURING A CLUCOS HAVE A CLUCOS MONETR ON YOUR AW HAVE ONE ON RO NO NO NO I USED TO I LEARNT LA LAST TIME I SID YOU HAD THIS THING IT LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE A LIKE A SMALL LEECH NOT A LARGE LEECH AND THERE'S MEASURING YOUR BLOOD LUTUPS THE VERY INFORMATIV BECAUSE YOU LEARN WHAT YOUR BODY REACTS TO AND GRAPES WERE REALLY BAT RONTIPATRIC I AGREES WITH THAT BUT DO THE THE ISSUE WAS WAS WHAT WE WERE WE ENDER ITHE ISSUE IS WHETHER NOT YOU CAN EXPECT ANY IMMEDIATE EFFECTS ON ENERGY VITALITY FOCUS ANY JUST EVEN SUBJECT AS H WHAT Y FEEL IS THE QUESTION AND ANECTOTALLY CAUSE I'VIN TAKEN THIS FOR LONETIME IF I DON'T TAKE IT I STOP TO FEEL FIFTY YEARS OLD ASORRO A MY CON THINGS TRAIGHT I IT MAY MAY BE POSIVA BUT WHO KNOWS BUT WHAT WER DOING NOW AE VERY CAREFUL CLINICAL TRIALS WE DONE THE SAFETY FOR TWO YEARS AND WE NOW TREATING ELDERLY PATIENCE AT HOVIDMITICAL SCHOOL WITH SOME WONDERFUL COLLEGUES AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE AND CONNLY IN EMARIYES SO YEU CAN MEASURE THE ENERGETICS AND HE THE INADY LEVELS IN THEIR LEGS AS THEY EXERCISE IN RILL TIME AND THAT WILL TELL US IF WHAT WE SEE IN THE MICE THES INCREASED ENDURANCE ACTUALLY WORKS IN THE MEANTIME IT'S FON TO TALK ABOUT ANECDOTES HAVE A NUMBER OF ATHLETE FRIENDS  SOME OF WHICH HAVE INCREASED THERE  LOID THEI TIME IN MARATHONS FOR EXAMPLE IS A GOOD FRIEND ABOUS A I NOW CIRCLE THAT IS WINNING MARATHONS AT AGE FIFTY NOW AN HY ATTRIBUTES THAT TO THE PUTICOLITIES ON SING I HAVEN'T STARTYD TAKING ANIMAN BUT I PLANNING TO DO THAT A WHEN MY NEXTBERTH DEY AREAFS WHICH IS IN A COUPLE MONTHS BUT I I DO EXPERIMENTS ANL MY SISTER AND HAVE FOR YEARS I HAVE A SISTERS AM THREE YEARS OLDER THAN I AM WHO A IS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THESE PROTOCOLS AND I'LL TELL IT YOU THAT AFTER READING YOUR BOOK I STARTED PURCHASING FOR HER IN GIVING HER AN ANIMAN SUPPLEMENT  AND SHE CLAIMS AND I BELIEVE HER AM SHE HAS QUITE SENSIVE SISTEM S SHE'S READY TUNED INTO IT SHE FEELS AM FAR AND AWAY BETTER WHEN SHE TAKES IT AS SUPPOST TO WHEN SHE DOESN'T AND I'VE DONE THE CONTROL EXPERIMENT OF REMOVING HER AM HER SUPPLY AND THEN GIVING IT BACK TO HER IN THIS KIND OF THING SO AM THAT'S MY OTHER LABORATORY A IS IS WHAT YOUNGER BROTHERS DO TO OLDER SISTERS I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IF IT HAS NO RELEVANCE WE CAN JUST A TREAT AS A SPEED BUMP AND THEN MOVE RIGHT ON IN THE THE ARTIFICIAL SWEET NURSE THESE THINGS THAT WERE I I WISHES A NON A GLUECOSE INCREASING SWEET NURSE AY YOU GOT STEVIA WHICH IS A A PLANT BASICALLY AND THEN YOU'VE GOT SUCOLOS AND ASPERTAIMEN ALL THESE THINGS THERE OUGHT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT EN NO WE'RE BOTH AWARE OF THE BEEN PUBLISHING QUITE REPUTABLE JOURNAL SHOWING THAT THEY CAN DISRUPT A THE GOT MYCROBIOM IN CERTAIN CASEIS IN PARTICULAR SACRON THE ONE THAT BASELY NOBODY USES ANY MORE A AND IT'S QUESTIONABLE AS TO WHETHER NOT STEVIA AS THE SAME NEGATIVE EFFECTS ET CETERA THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT IN TERMS OF THE SENSATION OF OR THE PERCEPTION OF SWEET TASTE IS IS THAT ITSELF A POSSIBLE DETRIMENT TO THESE AM PROLON GEVITY FOR GIVE ME FOR USING THE TERM THAT AM A PATHWAYS YOU KNOW IF IF I WERE TO DRINK A DIE COX DURING A FAST IN MY SOMEHOW DISRRUPTING THIS AND I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I GET ASKED THIS QUESTION A LOT WELL THAT THERE MAY BE SMALL EFFECTS I DON'T THINK THEY'RE WORTH WARRING ABOUT A JOROGAN LAFT OF MEAUS I WAS DRINKING A DIED COK DURING THE FIRST INTOGUIGE WITH HIM A I WILL DRINK DIT COK A I'VE READ THE SCINTICAL LITERATURE AND AGAIN AT'S THIS FIVE PER CENT THING THAT I THINK IS BLOWN OUT O PROPORTION IF I WAS TO PUT A A NUMBER ON IT I WOULD SAY IF EATING A HIGH SUGARY ME OR DRINKING A SUGAR FILLED SODA WHAT IS THAT THIRTY GRAMS OF SUGAR LET'S SAY THAT'S A THAT'S A TAIN AT A TEN BAD FOR YOU I DIED COT MIGHT BE A ONE AND IF I'M U NOT WHICH YOM MI GOING TO DO I COULD HAVE A A TEN OR ONE OR GO WITHOUT IN MY LIFE I'LL DO THE ONE ON OCCASION I TRY TO AVOID THEM BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE ONES AS MUCH BUT YOU CAN'T SAY THAT SUCALIS IS EQUIVALENT TO DRINKING A SUGARY SODA IS JUST NO COMPARISON AND I THINK SUIT WHAT IS AT STEVIA I DO USTEVIA WHENEVER I CAN BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A AN NATURALLY SAUCE PRODUCT AND HAVEN'T SEEN ANY GOOD EVIDENCE YET THAT IT'S BAD FOR YOU BUT I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS IS OVERBLOWN AND A LOT OF IT'S THAT THE MEDIA TRYING TO GIVE EQUAL WAIGHT TO STORIES AS YOU KNOW IS A SCIENTIST IT CAN BE FROSTRATING WHEN SOMETHING'S ATTAIN IN SOMETHING TO ONE AND THEY'RE QUATED HOW DO I SAY THIS RESPECTFULLY I THINK IF SCIENCE JOURNALISTS WERE A REQUIRED TO POST THEIR CREDENTIALS THALONGSIDE THEIR THEIR NAME  PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THE ARTICLES AN TO WITH A ADDITIONAL GRAIN OF SAULT I AND IN OTHER WORDS THAT I THINK THAT MOST THE SINS MEETYAS MAINLY GENERATE AROUND TWO  SPECIFIC GULLS ONE IS TO MAKE PEOPLE VERY VERY AFRAID WERE GET PEOPLE VERY VERY EXCITED AND OFTENTIMES THE THE GET PEOPLE EXCI DEPARTED SPONSERD CONTENT AND I THINK THAT'S OVERLOOKED IN ANY CASE A THANK YOU FOR THAT I WNT TO TALK ABOUT IRON AN IRON LOAD WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT FERITON AND OF COURSE WOMEN MEN STRATE AM AND SO THEY THEIR IRON NEEDS ARE GREATER THAN PEOPLE MEN THAT DON'T MENSTRATE WERE WOMEN THAT DON'T MENSTRATE HOWI DONT THING WE CAN GET RIGHT OWN INTO HOW MUCH IRON SOMEBODY NEEDS BECAUSE YOUR VERY PERSON A PERSON BUT I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT IRON IS ACTUALLY GOING TO ACCELERAT THE AGING PROCESS A IN VARIOUS CONTUCTS THAT THIS IS NEW FINDING A KNEW FINDING OUT OF SPAIN MENERAL SERONOS LAV HAS FOUND THAT EXCESS IRON WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SENESSEN CELLS IN THE BODY AND SENNESSENCELLS OF THESE OMBYCELLS THAT ACCUMULATE AS YOU GET OLDER AND THEY SIT THERE AND THEY CAUSE INFLAMMATION MAINLY IN AL SO CAN COSE CANCER AND IT'S FOUND THAT IF YOU GET RID OF THESE CELLS OR NEVER ACCUMULATE THEM A YOU STAY YOUNGER IN INANIMALS AND TAS SOME REALLY INTERESTING STUDIES OUT OF MAY OCCLINICAN CUMANS AS WELL SO IRON IS A PROSENESSON A METTL AND'S WHAT I THINK IS THAT IF YOUR TAKING EXCESS IRON AS A SUPPLEMENT YOU PROBABLY ACCELERATING YOUR AGING PROCESS THE OTHER THING THAT I FOUND REALLY INTERESTING IS I I'VE LOOKED AT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE S METABOLISM AND THEIR BLOOD BY YOUR MARKERS IM I WAYS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE IN INSIDE TRACKER IS A BORD MEMBERAND I'M THE SOLY SCIENTIFIC OM LEAD I SO I I CAN LOOK ANONYMOUSLY AT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE'S BLOOD WORK AND WE ALSO KNOW HOW FIT THEY ARE HOW OLD THEY ARE I SOME OF THEM MARTHON RUN AN SOME OF THEM ARE O CROSS FIT AND THERE'S A SIGNATURE OF HEALTH THAT ACTUALLY IS DIFFERENT THAN YOUR AVERAGE PERSON NEL I'M NO KING TO SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT EMDIES CAUSE IT BLOOD  MY BEST FRIENDS ARE EMDIES D I WORK WITH THEM AT HOVEN MEDICAL SCHOOL THE ISSUE TO IS THAT WITH EM TE TRAINING IT'S THERE'S A SCALE OF WHAT'S NORMAL AND IF YOU'RE OUT OF THAT NORMAL RANGE SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG THAT'S THE PARADINE THAT THEY WORK UNDER BUT FOR SO EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE BASE LINE IN TRACK PEOPLE OF YEARS TO KNOW WHATS NORMAL FOR THEM AN WHAT I FIND FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY HEALTHY AND LEAVE THE WAY I DO AND HAVE A DIET THAT'S I FAIRLY VEGETARIAN BUT NOT STRAIGHT I STILL HAVE SLIGHTLY LOW HEMICAL OF IN LEVELS SLIGHTLY LOW IRON SLIGHTLY LID FERITON BUT WE HAVE SUPERMOUNTS OF ENERGY WERE NOT AN NE MAKE AND WE GETTING ALONG WITH GREAT IN LIFE BUT A DOCTOR WHO JUST LOOKS AT THAT MIGHT SAY ALL WE NEED TO GIVE YOU MORE IRON SO WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WE NEED TO PERSONALIZE MEDICINE AND LOOK AT PEOPLE OVER THE LONG RUN TO KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR THEM AND WHAT'S HEALTHY FORFOR THEM AND NOT JUST WORK TOWARDS THE AVERAGE HUMAN BUT WORK TOWARDS WHAT'S OPTIMAL FOR HUMAN I OF THAT ANSWER I HE YOU MENTION TRACKING AND TRACKING OVER TIME AND THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING AREA THAT I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON FOR A LONG TIME I'VE BEEN GETTING BLOOD WORKED ON ABOUT EVERY SIX MONTHS SINCE I FRANKLY SINCE I WAS IN COLLEGE I JUSTGOT I LIKE DATA AND I I' GOT INTERESTIN SUPPLEMENTATION AND EXERCISE AS IT MADE ME FEEL BETTER BUT ALSO WONT TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON UNDER THE HOD ISE YOU GET NUMBERS BACK YET THIS HORM ON THAT HORMON THIS BLOOD GLUE COAST MEASURE EECETERA HOW DO YOU MAKE SENSE OF THE DATA I MEAN WHAT INSIDE TRACER IS DOING ASIDE HOW DO YOU PERSONALLY MAKE SENSE OF THE DATA AND WAYS THAT MIGHT DIFFER FROM THE WAY THAT A STANDARD EMDY MIGT LOOK AT ONE OF THESE CHARTS BECAUSE THE STANDARD PRACTICE IS TO SAY IS IT RED YELLOW ORGREEN I IS IT BASICALLY TOO HIGH WERE TOO LOW IS IT SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO THE MARGINS OR ARE YOU OKEY ARE YOU IN THESE RANGERS ARE THERE ANY THINGS THAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THAT YOU THINK ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE TO JUST TAKE NOTE OF A MEN IT WERE NOT ASKING TO GO AGAINST ANYBODY'S PHYSICIAN ANM BUT WHAT SORTS OF THINGS SHOULD PEOPLE START TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES ABOUT AND TERMS WHAT THESE MOLECULES ARE ON THEIR CHARTE IF THEY CHOOSE TO GET THEM AND WHAT YOU WAT YOU LOOK AT YE WHELE THERE'S A LOT THERE A THE FIRST IS THAT YOU SHOULD BE TRACKING THINGS  BECAUSE ONE MEASUREMENT ISN'T ENOUGH THESE THINGS VERY AND OVER TIME AND YOU IF YOU CAN HAVE A DECATE OR MORE OF DATA IT'S SUPERIMPORT INFORMITY AS YOU NO WELL NOW I AS YOU KNOW SO THAT THE PHYSICIAN INTERESTINGLY MY PHYSICIAN LET'S TAKE HIM IS AN EXAMPLE I SO HE SEES ME HE SAYS OW FEELING I'M FEELING GREAT A CASO NEXT YEAR THAT'S CRAZINESS ANY WAY SISAO CA STAV LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LET ME EDUCATE YOU THAT'S WHAT DAVID TELLS THIS PIS INITION I IMAGINE THAT THE LIKE TWELVE YEAR OLD DAVIDSON CLARE SAYS TO CITITION LISTEN LET LET'S HAVE A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION THA OR WHER IT IS HE HE FINDS ME PRETTY ANNOYING AS TO DOES MY DENTIST BUT SO I SAY SOK HANG I'VE GOT THIS DATA I'VE GOT THE INSIDE TRACKADATUS I PULL THAT UP ON THE SCREEN AND HE I'M SURE SHOWING HIM MY THE CHANGE IS IN MY COLESTER ALL IN MY I SEE OUR PE WHICH IS IN FLAMETARY MOCKERS YOU KNOW AN WE GOING THROUGH IT YOU CAN SEE THINGS CHANGE OF TIME AND AND I'VE CORRECTED THEM AS THEY GO SLIGHTLY OUT OF THE OPTOMA RANGE FOR ME WHICH IS DIFFERENT THEN WHAT HE WOULD DO OF COURSE BUT WHAT WAS FUNNY IS THAT HE SAYS THIS IS GREAT I LOVE THIS DATA BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GET THIS BECAUSE COURSE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ONT PAY FOR IT SO AGAIN YOU CAN PAY OUT OF POCKET IT'S IS NOT SUPEREXPENSIVE I WOULD SAY IF YOU SAVE A BIT OF MONEY ONE ON AON A COFFEE I YOU CAN AFFORD THIS KIND OF STAV BUT THE THE MAIN POINT IS THAT DOCTORS DUE LIKE THIS DATA IT'S JUST THA THEN UNABLE TO SPEND MONEY ON EVERY ONE OF THEIR PATIENTS TO GET IT IS THERE A COD WORD THAT SOME ONE CAN USE WITH THEIR PHYSICION THAT  TRIGGER OF HE COMPREHENSIVE BLOOD TUST I KEEN TRY TO FINGER OUT WHAT'S THE CODE I THAT ONE NEEDS TO ASK THERE IS RTELL THEIR DOCTOR LIKE I'M FEELING BLANK SO THAT THEY GET A FULL BLOOD PANEL WAT WELL YOU HAVE TO BE HAMERAGIN FROM THE FROM LE GAT ERS ONLY WELL I USUALLY USE THE  W T H METHOD WHICH IS WHAT THE HELL AND THEN HE AND THI SAS ACATE WILL DO IT AM S CAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE I THINK ANG LOOK I LOVED OUT BLOOD WORK REPEATEDLY OVER TIME BUT THAT'S HARD TO GET FOR FINANCIAL REASONS BUT ALSO LOPYOU JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPROACH THE CONVERSATION AND THIS IS ONE OF THINGS THAT I I HOPE THAT WE CAN EDUCATE PEOPLE ON YOU KNOW THAT THEY DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THEIR BODY AND THAT ET MAKES A DOCTORS VISIT WORTH WHILE AND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEIN ILLNESS IN ORDER TO DO IT RIGHT Y AND LORD PEOPLL DO SO I A IF Y IF YOU CAN AFFORD THESE TESTS THERE ARE INCREASING NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT OFFER THESE TESTS INSIDETRACTOR IS ONE OF THEM AND YOU JUST DO IT A COUPLE OF TIMES A YEAR AT A MINIMAM AND THEN YOU CAN SHAD THAT WITH YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN' AFFORD THAT THEN I WOULD SAY TO YOUR DOCTOR HE ARE THE MAIN ONES THAT ANDREW AN DAVID TO ET EN WE MUST AND THERE'S AN EMAL THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE FIVE FIVE OR A FOR NUMBER RATHER IT'S FIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE I THINK IF THEY HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS THEY CAN JUST CALL THAT AM DAVID WILL PICK UP A O NISE COASTNOT BUSINESS HARZEV GT I LI ADER YOS HOURS H BUT THERE IS THE MAINONES I WOULD SAY A YOU BLOOD SHUGAL LEVELS YOU WANT TO DO YOUR H P WHEN SEE WHICH IS YOUR AVERAGE CLUCOS LEVELS OVER THE MON THIS A SEE OR P WHICH I MENTION FOR INFLAMMATIO WAS TALK ABOUT SA REACTIV BROTINE FOR A SECOND CAUSE I THINK ON IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN EARLY MARKER OF MACULAR DEGENERATION OF OF A HEART DISEASE OF VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS UM SEEAR P IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT I THINK UM MAYBE HT WHAT YOU KNW ABOUT SEROPE THAT I DON'T I 'M GUESSING A LOT BUT OH WHO AS ORIGINALLY PICKED UP AS SOMETHING THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HEARTDISEAS AND THE FRAMING HAM STUDYAPLY A IT IT IS A THE BEST MARK OF FOR CADIVASCULAR INFLAMMATION AND IS ALSO WUSE IT AS A PREDICT OR OF LONGEVITY AND IT'S LEVELS GO UP AND WITH MORTALITY AND SO THITS AN ASSOCIATION BUT THERE'S ENOUGH DATA THAT I WOULD SAY IF YOU HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF SRP YOU NEED TO GET YOUR LEVELS DOWN QUICKLY AND THE LEVELS USUALLY GO UP WITH AGE  AND WITH LEVELS F INFLAMMATION SO THE WAYS TO GET IT DOWN WOULD BE TO SWICH THE DIET EAT LESS A TRY TO EAT WOL VEGETABLS YOUL FIND IT WILL COME DOWN THERE ALSO DRUGS THAT CAN DO IT  ANTEN CLAMATRIES  CAN DO IT AS WELL BUT SAR P IS ESSECIALLY H SAR P AS A HIGHCENSITYVE   ARP YOUR DOCTOR WILL NO GET ONE OF THOSE READINGS I IF YOU'VE GOT NOMAL BLOODSHUGA LEVELS YOUR DOCTOM O FASTING BLOODSHU LEVELS A YOUR DOCTOR MIGHT SAY YOU FIND BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NORMAL BLOODSHUGER IT HAVE HIGH SAR P WHICH IS JUST AS BAD FOR YOU LONG TE AND CAN PREDICT A FUTURE HARTI AL LINES OF HEART ATTACK I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ON CLESTER ALL AND SYRUM CLUSTER ALL INDIETARY CGLESTERA I CAN NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME GET MY ARMS AROUND THIS LITERATURE AND EVEN IF I IGNORE ALL THE ESSENTIALLY NONSENSE THAT'S OUT THERE AND VERY SOCIAL MEDEA GROUPS TA SAYING CLESTER ALL IS T IS THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD OR CLESTERAL IS NOT IT OR DIETARY CLESTER ALL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SERM CLESTER ALL NOTHING TO DO WITH LONGEVI I I CAN'T SEEM TO SORT THROUGH THE THE VERY BASIC DATA THAT ESSENTIALLY ASK IS HAVING HIGH LEVELS OF ELD ELL AND A KILL ME EARLIER SHOULD I BE STRIVING TO ALWAYS REDUCE EL DE ELL AN INCREASE H DELL IS THAT A REASONABLE GOLL AND IF SO IS DIETARY CLESTERALL THE PRIMARY DETERMINANT OF THAT AND JUST AS A FINAL POINT ABOUT THIS I AM AWARE OF QUITE GOOD DATA THAT SHOWS THAT IN ARAXIX PEOPLE THAT ESSENTIALLY NO FOOD UNLESS YOU FORCE THEM TO CAN OFTEN HAVE VERY HIGH ELL DE YELL SOTHER DIETARY CLESTER ALL IS ESSENTIALLY ZERO AND SO THEIR MANUFACTURING A LOT OF THEIR OWN SO REALIZE THIS ISN'T YOUR PRIMARY O TAORY OF EXPERTESE BUT YOUR SMARGI YOU THINK ABOUT THIS CONNISTOPHAL LOT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON WITH THE CLESTER ALL LITERATURE AND WILL WE EVER GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS  AS HE SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE TO ME IT IS RATHER PERPLEXING IT IS AH BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN GET THROUGH THE POLITICS I KNOW A FEBITE ABOUT CLESTROAS IT IT'S IN MY FAMILY HISTORY AND I I WAS HEADED FOR NOLY DEATH MY GRANDMOTHER HAD A STROKE OF THIRTY THAT'S HOW BAD I AM IN TURNS MY GENETICS SO I WENT ON A STATIN AND I KNOW THER THERE'S LORD PEOPLE SAY THAT STATANS LONG TURM AR BAD AT MYT SASSOCIATED WITH WITHOUT SAMES DISEASE AH I I'VE BEEN TAKING STATANSINCSELS TWENTY NINE AND THAT'S CAUSE I FORCED MY SAME DOCTOR TO GIVE ME THE STATAN THE CONVERSATION WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE ON ESTATIN SO WHAT YOU WANT ME TO HAVE HAVE A HEARD ATTACK FOR YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING GIVE IT TO ME NOW O TWENTY NINE OF BEEN ON A STADIN A MY CLESTRALL WAS WAY UP IN BEYOND THREE HUNDRED WHICH IS A MASSIVE MASS OUT BASICALLY MY BLOOD WAS CREAMY TO LOOK AT SO I'VE NOT GOT MY CLESTERAL DOWN TO LOW LOW LEVELS TO WHAT BE GO CHECK ON MYINSIDE TRACTOR BUT SO MY RASURE OF ACHTY EL TO ELDEEL WHICH ONE BE LESS THAN FIVE IS NOW TOO AND THE EL DEEL IS BLOW A HUNDRED SO TOLL GOOD AND MY HIAVE MEASURED MY CADIVASCO HEALTH WITH THE NAMARIA AR MOVY MY HEART BEATING I'VE STILL GOT A HEART OF A TWENTY YEAROL SO THAT'S WORKING IAM WILLING TO FOREGO THE RISK THAT THE STATAN IS CAUSING PROBLEMS LATER BECAUSE OF MY FAMILY HISTORY BUT OTHER PEOPLE I WOULD SAY Y BE AWARE THAT STATAN'S ON PERFECT DRUGS THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING NEW ONES THATS ONE CALLED TE PS CANIN IN HIBITER WHICH IS A I THINK FORTNIGHTLY EVERY TWO WEEKS INJECTION THAT BLOCKS THE RELEASE OF O EL BEEL FROM THE LIVER AH AND THEN THAT SEEM TO BE GREAT FOR LORIN CLEESTRALL BUTTL SAYS OTHER BENEFIT'S THAT MIGHT BE PROLONGEVITY N THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE AT WAS JUST TALKING TOR ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF THIS AND THET DOCTORS AFE TRYING THEM ON THIS DRUG INSTEAD OF THE STATANSO HE COULD TALK TO YOU DOCT ABOUT DO YOU AVOID AM DIETARY CLESTER ALL FOR THAT REASON ALSO READ ME BUTTER AT I HAVEBEEN A LOVE BUTTER I LOVE RED MEAT WHO I HAVE REALIZE HER SOMEBE WO WHO DON'T AMY CLEESTER ALSL WILL BE HIGH BUT I I'M WORKING TO BRING THAT DOWN A BIT A MOL THOG NOT MY ALTERING MY FOOD AND TAKE A YET A BUT WHAT YOU THINK IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIETARY CLEESTER ON SERM CLEESTER ALL AND WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE LIVER WIR AN ER EXIX YET YHE ENWIRES THERE AF TERM CLEESTER ALL SO HIGH WHEN THE'RE EATING NOTHING THET WILL HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF PAPERS OVER THE YEARS THAT AVE BEING IGNORED AND TE OUR FRIEND PETER IT'S HERE A BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION RECENTLY A NEW STUDY THAT I THINK DEFINITIVELY SAID THAT DIETARY CLESTROL HAS ALMOST ZERO IN PACT ON BLOOD CLESTROLEVELS GOOD YER SO  I AM ANNOYED CAUSE I'VE BEEN AVOIDING EGGS AND BUTTER FRORMOST OF MY LIFE AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO SO I HAD I HAVE EXLAINTING YOR TIME N EARLEAST IN YOUR CASE YEE SO THAT THAT'S THE THING AYOU CAN EAT THESE FOODS THAT WILL ONCE MAN BECAUSE THE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TO TAKE COLESTRAL UP INTO THE BODY FROM THE GOT AND MOST OF ITS BEING SINTECIZED IN THE BODY WELL I'M JUST PAUSING THERE FOR SECOND BECAUSE I THINK THAT IM IT IT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD SIX MEALS A DAY YOU KNOW EAT A LOT OF GRAINS AND FRUITS AND THIS KIND OF THING IM YOU KNOW I A VOID COLESTER ALL I MEAN BASILY EVERYTHING WE LEARNED IN THE EIGTIES AND NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSANDS IS GETTING FLIPPED ON ITS HEAD NOW IM BUT AND I THINK THIS IS VERY STRONG CARVYAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION A MENO ACITS IN PARTICULARLY YOU MEANO ACIDS THAT COME FROM ANIMAL PRODUCTS RIGHT SEEM TO HAVE SOME PRO AGING EFFACT ON THEM RIGHT AT LEAST THE WAY THAT I'VE HEARD YOU DESCRIBE THE YOUR DIET NI'M SOMEBODY WHO ENJOIS MEAT I LIKE IT BUT I'M SOING BY NO MEANS A A VEGAN AND AT ALL BUT I'VE HEARD YOU SAY YOU EAT MOSTLY PLANTS BUT A LITTLE BIT OF FISH OR CHICKEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT OF EGGS OR IM BUT IS THAT SPECIFICALLY TO AVOID EXCESSIVE AMENOACIDINTAKER IS AT SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT PLANTS THAT THAT ECITES YOU WITH RESPECT I MEAN VEGETABLES ARE DELICIOUS TOO BUT WHAT IS IS THAT SOMETHING GREAT ABOUT PLANTS OR IS T SOMETHING BAD ABOUT WHEN I THINK OF MEAT I GUESS THE BIOLOGIST AN METHINKS A MENO ACIDS RIGHT I DON'T THINK TOPSEROON I THINK A MEANO ACIN I THINK OBSTERLOIN AS A MEATING IT BUT REALLY WHAT THEY ARE OR A MENO ACIDS INCLUDING LOOSING YE WEL THERE ARE TWO GOOD THINGS ABOUT PLANTS A AND NEITHER OF THEM IS TASTE FOR ME I I WOULD EAT STAKE ALL THE TIME IF I COULD I DID WHEN I WAS A KID I'M ASTRAILIAN BUT PLANTS OFE TWO BENEFITS ONE IS THAT THEY'RE HIGHLY NUTRICIOUS AND I'LL GIVE YOU A LOT OF TH THE VITAMENS AND  NUTRINTS THAT I NEED I DON'T TAKE A MULTIVI HIM AND I DON'T WANT HAVE THE EXCESS IRON IN MY BODY SO THERE'S THAT HIDENSITY NUTRITIONS OR THOSE DARK LEAVES IF IT'S A SPINISH SALID GREAT IM THE SECOND IS THAT THERE IS WHAT CALLED ZENO HERMETIC MOLECULES IN PLANTS THAT TERMS INO HERMISUS IS HE TERM THAT I CAME UP WITH WITH MY FRIEND CONADE HOWITS WHICH MEANS STRESS PLANTS MAKE MOLECULES THAT BENEFIT YOUR HEALTH I'LL BREAK IT DOWN ZENO MEANS BETWEEN SPECIES AND HORMISUS IS THE TERM WHATEVER DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER AND LIVE LONGER AND THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN PLANTS ASE STRESSED OUT THINK OF A GREAT VINE THAT'S DRIED OUT AND THES SINE TO HOVISE THE GRAPES WHICH IS TYPICALLY HEUTSD ON THEY ARE FUL WITH RESVERTRAL BECAUSE VERS VERTRAL IS A PLANT DEFENCE MOLECULE THAT I THINK IS MADE TO ACTIVATE THOSE SORTUAN GANS IN H PLANTS O PLANTS HAVE SOTULANCS JUST LIKE WEADER BUT BY INT IT PURIFYING OR AT LEAST CONCENTRATING IN A LIKT PROVE BOTTLE IN KEEPING IT OUT OF THE AIR WE STABLIZED THIS ZINOHERMETIC MOLECULE OR IT'S A COKTAIL NOT JUST ONE I'S OTHERS IN WINE WE THEN IN JEST THOS AND GET THE BENEFITS OF ACTIVATING OUR OWN DEFENSES BECAUSE OUR FOOD WAS GETTING STRESSED OUT AND BY STREST I DON'T MEAN PSYCHOLOGICALLY STREST I MEAN BIOLOGICALLY STRESS A AND SO I TRY TO EPLANTS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH BIT OF STRESS THEY MIGHT BE BRIGHTLY COLORED THAT ARE TOO MUCH SANO G NIBBLED ON BY A CATERPILLAR SYOU GO TO PLACES WHERE IT'S ORGANIC OR ITS FRESH LOCAL AND KNOWS THE PLANTS THAT ON PERFECT AND THEY PRABLY HAVE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF THESE MOLECULES AND IN ADDITION I AS O BY THE SUPPLEMENTS TO MAKE SHIM GETTING ENOUGH R OSAS ON WHICH SUPPLEMENTS MIMET THAT ALSO AS VERTRALL WILL IS ANOTHER ON CALLED CRICITON OR CROCIT IN SOME PEOPLE CALL IT WICH YOU FIND IN TRACE AMOUNTS AN A APPLES AND ONIONS AND WE ALSO SHOW BACK INTWO THOUSAND THREE THAT IT ACTIVATES OR TUANS AS WELL BUT OTHERS OF TWHENTY YEARS LATEV FOUND THAT IT KILL CINESSENCELLS OR HELPS KILL CINESENCELLS O IT'S A DOUBLE WAMMING WITH THAT MOLECULE AND ARE YOU ACTIVELY PICKING OUT THE PEACHES THAT LOOK LIKE THEY WERE NIBBLED ON BY A CATERPILLAR NO BUT A I DON'T WORRY IF THEY'VE BEEN BANGED OUP A BIT WHAT'S THE STORY WITH ANTI OCCIDENTS ARE THEY OF ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER BECAUSE THE WAY THAT YOU DESCRIBED THEM AT THE BEGINNING AN WHAT I'VE HEARD RECENTLY IS THAT THEY ARE NOT ALL THE RAGE FOR AM ANTI AGEN A WHAT ARE THEY DOING THAT'S USEFUL SHOULD WE BE SEEKING OUT ANCIOCCIDENTS ANY WAY FOR OTHER SELLER HEALTH PURPOSES WELL YOU ANTOCCIDENTS NOT GOING TO HURT YOU UNLESS YOU TAKE MAKEADOSES WE DO NEEDS SOME OCCIDENTS FOR OUR UN SYSTEM AND THERE'S EVEN WHAT'S CALLED MY TO HORMESES WHICH IS YOUR MIGHTICONDRIA POWPACS NEED HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THESE FREE RADICALS TO BE OLD A FUNCTION A SO YOU DON'T WANT OVEDOS ON THESE ANTOXEN SPIDIMEN SEE VIDE HIMAN E DON'T OVERDO OVERDO IT YOU DON'T TAKE A MULTIVITEMEN CORRECT RIGHT I THNK GOM IN TO STOP AFTER THIS CONVERSATION IS I'VE ALWAYS JUST TAKEN WHAT FOR THE KIND OF INSURANCE PURPOSE WHICH IS A STUPID PURPOSE AM I NOT ACTUAL INSURANCE BUT JUST THINKING A YOU ALL CAP WE ALL TOP OFF ON MY  C B D RA NO I'LL PE OUT WHAT I DON'T NEED IASSURE THAT NEVER BOTHERED ME THE WHOLE EXPENSIVE PEATHING NEVER GOT THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT ARGUMENT EVER GOT MEE AS A THAT THE GOOD WIDMEN IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE AM I JUST FIRGURED BETTER SAFE THAND SORRY BUT IT MAY BE THAT IT'S DETRIMENTAL WELI IT IT CAN IN THE CASE OF IRON AS WE DISCUSSED AN THE ANTOXONS SO WHEN I CAME INTO THE AGEN FIELD AND THE AM EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES IT WAS ALL ABOUT ANTOCCIDENTS WE THOUGHT THAT ENTIMS BY THE NAME OF CATALAYS AND SUPROXID DISMETATE WHETHER CANN BE THE KEY TO LONGERITY IT TURNS OUT THAT AT IT'S LARGELY BEING A FAILURE THAT GIVING ANIMALS A AND ANTS HUMANS ANTOCCIDENTS HAVENT HAD THE LON GEVITY BENEFITS THAT WE DREAMED OF AND THE MAIN REASON IS THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE GOING ON THAN JUST FRE RADICAL DAMAGE A THE EPIGINOM GETS DE SROPTED WE GOT THESE PROACHINGS MISFOLDING SO THE PROBLEM REALLY HAS BEENG THAT WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU NEED TO TURN ON THE BODY'S NATURAL DEFENCES AGAINST THAT PLOS A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER THINGS TO GET THE TRUE BENEFITS BUT ONT LOOCINSATES A PROBLEM TAKING IT IN OUR AN ANTOXIDENT DRINK POMEGRANITIUES FOR ONE IS FULL OF GOOD STOV INCLUDINGS IN O HERMETIC MOLECULES BUT RESVERTRAL IS A GOOD CASE IN POINT WHICH IS WHEN I WORKED ON RESVERTRAL AS A LON GEVITY MOLECULE FIRST WE SHOWED IT IN EAST AN ONEAN FLIES AN MICE A BEFORE THAT IT WAS THOUGHT THE RESVERTRAL WAS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART IN RED WINE WHEN YOU DRINK RE WINE BECAUSE IT'S AN ANTIOCCIDENT SO THEN WE SHOWED THAT IT EXTENDED THE LIFESPAN OF YEAST CELLS THROUGH THIS A GENETIC PATHWAY THE SORTUANS AND WE THEN TESTED WHETHER IS VERTRAL IF WE CHANGE ONE ATEM TO MAKE IT NOTINANTOCCIDENT GUESS WHAT IT'S SO WORKE FINE SO IT WASN'T ITS ANTOXIDEN ACTIVITY THAT WAS EXTENDING LIFES AND IT WAS ITS ABILITY TO TURN ON THE YEASTS DEFENCES AGAINST AGING CONVERSELY WHEN WE GAVE THE EAST ANTOCCIDENTS THEY LOOKED SHORTER SO YET THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY TRANSORMATION IN THINKING TURN ON THE BODY'S DEFENCES DON'T GIVE IT THE ANTOCCIDENTS THIS IS A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SAY SOMETHING IVE BEEN WANTING TO SAY FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS THAT THAT WHAT SO WONDERFUL ABOUT SCIENCE IS THAT BECAUSE THE GOAL IS MECHANISM YOU CAN REALLY START TO UNDERSTAND AS YOU JUST DESCRIBED WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY MEDIATES A PROCESS IS VERY DIFFENT THAN WHAT MODULATES A PROCESS I MAN A FIRE ALARM GOES OFF IN THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING TO MODULATE OUR ATTENTION THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT CONTROLS OUR OUR ATTENTION IT'S NOT MECHANISTICALLY RELEVANT AND SO I THINK THIS THING ABOUT ANDIOCCIDENCE IS ONE OF THESE CASES IT SOUNDS LIKE WHERE IT'S IN THE RIGHT BALPARK BUT UNTIL ONE REALLY UNVEILS THE MECHANISM AS YOU HAVE YOU CAN BE A ONE CAN OR AND A FIELD CAN BE BADLY WRONG FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME AM IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SURTUANS AND REALLY GETTING DOWN TO THE THE GOTS OF THE MACHINERY OF WHAT CAUSES CELLS TO AGEIS REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT ZUMING WAY OUT WHAT ARE THE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THAT ONE CAN START TOF THING ABOUT INTERMS OF WAYS TO MODULATE THESE EH YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE WAY THET DEONA IS IS BEING EXPRESSED AND FUNCTIONING I'VE HEARD YOU TALK BEFORE ABOUT A HORNESIS OF OTHER SORTS COLD EXPOSURE A WE TALKED ABOUT FASTING WE TALKED ABOUT EXERCISE IN BROAD TERMS BUT WHAT ABOUT A ANY EVIDENCE IF IT EXISTS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AROBIC TRAINING VERSES WAIGT TRAINING THESE SORTS OF THINGS AM IN OTHER WORDS WHATEVER THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE ORTUAN PATHWAY AND A I REALIZE THAT THER CAVIATS WE CAN'T GO DIRECTLY FROM A BEHAVIOR DER SURTUNS BUT IN THE GENERAL THEME WHAT WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO WHAT DO YOU DO RIGHT WHEL WE KNOW THAT THAT EROVIC EXERCISE IN MY SAND RATS RAISES THEIR INATY LEVELS AND AND THE LEVELS OF SIR ONE OF THE GENES GOES UP OT TOO ACTUALLY NUMBER WONING OF THA THREE WHET WE DON'T KNOW YET IS WHAT TIGHT OF EXERCISE IS OLTIMALD TO GET THEM TO CHANGE WE WILL LEARN WE'RE DOING WORK NOW IT'S RE VEALED THAT WERE DOING WORK WITH THE MILITARY IN THE US TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THAT KIND OF THING  AND I'LL ALWAYS TELL YOU AND THE PUBLIC WHEN I DON'T KNOW SOMETHING O NOKING EXTRAPALATE  BUT WHAT DO I DO  I BASE MY EXERCISE ON THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WHICH HAS SHOWN THAT  MAINTAINING MUSCLE MASSES VERY IMPORTANT FOR NUMBER OF REASONS THE TWO MAIN ONES ARE I YOU WENE TO MAINTAIN YOUR HORMAN LEVELS I'M AND OLDER MALE LOSING MY TESTALS TRON AND MUSCLE MAST OOF A TIME AND BY EXERCISING I WILL MAINTAIN THAT AND HAVE OIN FACT I I I PROBABLY HAVEN'T HAD A BODY LIKE THIS SINCE OS TWENTY SO THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THES LIFE TIME SART INTER ARE WE DIDNAT EPISODE ON FOREMONES AND THERE ARE DATA IN HUMANS THAT SHOW THAT THERE ARE SOME MALES IN THEIR EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHERE THEIR TESTOSTRONE IS ACQUIVALENT TO THE AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY EAROLDS I CAN GET YOU THAT INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE STUDIES AMTH UNFORTUNATELY DIDN INCLUDE A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIFESTYLE FACTORS ET CETERA BUT THIS IDEA THAT TESTOSTRON GOES DOWN WITH AGE A IT MIGHT IT MIGHT BE THE TREND BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A A PREREQUISITE WHY I I BELIEVE IN IN NATUALLY INCREASING AND MAINTAINING THESE HORMERAN LEVELS AND I'VE BEEN MEASURING THEM FOR A LONG TIME AND I COULD SEE FOR ME MY TESTOS TOSSTORY LEVELS WAS STEADILY LEVELS WERE GOING DOWN AND THEN HE GOT TENURE ND THEY WENT BACK OV NO A ACTUALLY BECAME COMPLACENT AND AND A IT WAS THE WORST ACTUALLY MY AGE CHANGED IN THEIR ROWN DIRECTION AFTER THAT SI WAS RELAXED INTEREST AND NOT WIDE ABOUT THE FUTURE AH BUT THEN I GOT SERIOUS AND ACTUALLY ACCORDING TO THE INSIDE TRACERALD ALGER TEM BUT MY AGE DOWN FROM FIFTY EIGHT TO THIRTY ONE IN  MATTER OF MONTHS THAT THAT WAS A BIG DROPAN IE I'VE BEEN GETTING STEADILY YOUNGER OF THE LOST TEN YEARS ACCORDING TO THAT MEASURE MENT THE BLOON TES WHAT ABOUT ESTROGEN BECAUSE WWOMEN ARE DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT THEY DO A THE NUMBER OF EGGS THAT THEY AND THE OVERIES CHANGE OVER TIME RIGHT A DO YOU THINK THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN ESTROGEN LEVELS AT AIN A OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME IN USING SOME OF THESE SAME PROTICLES WELL THE I GET INTO TROUBLE FROM A CSUDDEN UNIVERSITY WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS TOO MUCH ABOUT ASTROGEN JUST ABOUT FERTILITY AND LONG STORY THAT IF I IF I I D ONAY GET TOO MUCH INTO THE ANECDOTES BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE SCIENCE WHICH IS A THAT IF YOU TAKE A A MOUSE AND P UT IT ON FASTING OR CLORIC RESTRICTION FOR UP UNTIL THE POINT WHERE IT SHOULD BE IN FERTILE SO THAT'S ABOUT IT AT A YEAR OF AGE AMOUSE GETS AND FERTIL FEMAL MOUNS DUE TO DUE TO FASTING ER L YOU O AIMPLY TO AGEAD YOU TO AGE A DOU TO AGING THE FASTING IT'S IT'S NOT EXTREME FAST IS JUST LESS CALORY ON IT THEN YOU PUT THEM BACK ON A REGULAR FOOD AND THEY BECOME FERTILE AGAIN FOR A MANY MANY MONTHS AFTERWARDS SO THE THE EFFECT ON SLOWING DOWN AGING IS ALSO ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM INTERESTING AND SO THAT I WOULDN'T SIHT AND H WOMEN I WOULDN'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BECOMES TO BASKINY TO TRY AND PRESERVE FERTILITY THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING BUT THESE PATHWAYS THAT WE WORK ON THESE FERTUINS ARE KNOWN TO DELAY IN FERTILITY IN FEMALE ANIMALS CASING POINT O I'M ONE OF THE LEADAL OUTHORS ON A PAPER WHENE WE USED AN AMEN REMEMBER THIS IS THE GAS THE FUEL PETRAL FOR THES ORTUINS WE GAVE OLD MICE A ONE GROUP OF MICE WAS SIXTEEN MONTHS OLD REMEMBER THEY BECAMEIN FERTILE AT TWELVE GAVE THEM AN A MAN AND THINK IT WAS ONLY SIX WEEKS LATER THEY HAD OFFSPRING THEY BECAME FERTILE AGAIN WHICH GOES AGAINST BIOLOGY IT TAKES BOOK BYT YOU WHICH IS THAT FEMALE MAMALS RUN OUT OF EGGS TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE YOU CAN RED DUVENATE THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND EVEN GET THEM TO COME OUT OF MALSUPOES AS WE CALL IT SO THAT'S A HONLY PARADIME IN MYLOGY AS WELL THAT SUPERINTERESTING A SARE IT INTERRUPT YOU BUT I'M AM REMINDED BY A SET OF OF A SET OF STUDIES THAT WERE DONE BY YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUE SIS THERE NO LONGER THEIRE DAVID HU RON TOWARDS TO WEASIL BY SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRAND PARENTS ONE THE NOBLE PRIZE FOR DISCOVERING WHAT ARE CALLED CRITICAL PERIODS THIS PHASE OF EARLY DEVELOPMENT WHEN THE BRAIN IS EXTREMELY PLASTIC AND A BIG PART OF THEIR WORK WAS TO SHOW THAT AFTER A CERTAIN POINT THE CRITICAL PERIOD SHUTS DOWN A SUCHALY THE BRAIN CAN'T CHANGE WERE NOT NEARLY IS AS MUCH AND THEN PEOPLE CAME ALONG LATER AND SHOW THAT YOU COULD OPEN UP THESE CRITICAL PERIODS AGAIN BUT VERY BRIEFLY AND  IF YOU TAKES A VERY SPECIFIC STIMULUS ESSENTIALLY HIGH DEGREES OF FOCUS ET CETERA HOWEVER THERE'S A WELL KNOWN PHENOMENON IN THIS LITERATURE WHERE IF YOU TAKE AN ANIMAL AND TO SOME DEGREE THIS HAS BEENG SHOWN IN HUMANS AS WELL AND YOU LET THEM PASS THROUGH THE CRITICAL PERIOD BUT THEN YOU ESSENTIALLY CENSURY DEPRIVE THEM YOU TAKE AWAY EXPERIENCE YOU CLOSE BOTH EYES YOU ESSENTIALLY REOPEN THE CRITICAL PERIOD SO IT SEEMS LIKE AI COULDN'T HELP A MENTION THAT THATHER'S THIS PARALLEL O BETWEEN WHAT RE TORE YOUI HEARE WITH FERTILITY AND NARROW PLASTICITY WHERE YES THEREIS A A TIMER WHERE CERTAIN THINGS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE ORGANISM EARLY IN LIFE AND THEN THEY TEND TO TAPER OFF IT'S NOT A OPEN AND SHOP IT THEY TAPER OFF BUT THEN A DEPRIVATION CAN ACTUALLY REACTIVATE THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT PROCESS A FORGIVE ME I JUST COULDN'T HELP A MENTION BUT IT TO ME IT THER SO BO TH OF THOSE THINGS ARE ASSOCIATE WITH YOUTH FERTILITY AND OR APLASTICITY AND SO I THINK THAT I IT BE SO INTERESTING I LOVE TO COLLABORATE WITH YOU ON THIS TO EXPLORE HOW NURRAL PLASTICITY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE REGULATED BY THESE THINGS LIKE THE SIR TUANS RI AND AND THI TERTUENTS DO CONTROL MEMORY A IN IN NURONDS IS WELL SO WHAT I THINK IS REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT WHAT WEAR LEARNING FROM WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR COLLEGUES HAVE DONE AND IN MY LIFE IS WELL IS THAT THE BODY HAS REMARKABLE POWERS OF HEALING AND RECOVERING FROM ILLNESS AND INJURY AND WHAT WE ONCE THOUGHT WAS HE ONE WAY STRAIT AND JUST CAUNT REPAIR YOU CAN GET OVER THESE DISEASES YOU CAN RESET THE SYSTEM AND THE BODY CAN REALLY GET REJUVENATED IN WAYS THAT IN THE FUTURE A WONDER WHY WHIDING WORK ON THIS OLIER WI THE THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY IS MORE LIKE US WOING AROUND LIKE DEAD POOL WELL PROBABLY BE CLEANER AND A ONE SMELL IS BADLY BUT DEAD POULL IF YOU DON'T KNOW CAN GET INJURED AND JUST RECOVER IT'S VERY HARD TO INJURE THE SKY A AND WE CAN BE THE SAME THERE WARE MANY SPECIES YOU CUT OFF THE LIMB THE LIMB GROWS BACK SALEMANDERS OR YE YET WE ARE NOW LEARNING HOW TO TAP INTO THAT SYSTEM AND IN PART WHAT WERE DOING IS REVERSING THE AGE OF THOSE CELLS AND TELLING THEM HOW TO READ THE GENES CORRECTLY AGAIN REVERSING THE AGE OF THAT EPIGINON A WE DO THAT THE SELLS THE BRAIN FOR INSTANCE OF THE SKIN  WE DID THE OPTIC NERVE  TE TIS TALK ABOUT THOS RESULTS FOR A SECOND THEN I WANT A MATURE THAT WE RETURN TO SOME THESE BEHAVIOAL PROTOCALS YE THIS AMAZING PAPER AT THE END THE LAST YEAR COVER ARTICLL FULL ARTICLEIN IN NATURE SHOWING THAT ESSENTIALLY A SMALL MEN YOU OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS WHICH CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION ET CETERA COULD ESSENTIALLY REVERSE THE AGE OF NARANS IN THE EYE AND AND RESCUE THOSELVES AGAINST DAMAGE I ESSENTIALY ALOW BLIND MICE TO SEE AGAIN AND OFFSET DEGENERATION OF THESE RETINALCELS INCREDIBLE PAPER OM AND SUCH A A A BOON TO THE FIELD WHERE IS THAT WHERE DOES THAT STAND NOW INTERMS OF HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS OM IT HOW WOULD YOU WOULD YOU INVISIONING IN TERMS OF THE TRAJECTORY OF THOSE OF THOSE DAY OR FROM MICE IN TO I INTO HUMAN SOME DAY I WELL TO TO GET TO THE POINT IMMEDIATELY A WERE  GOING TO BE TESTING THE TREATMENT ON O MONKEYS A FIS JUST FOR SAFETY REASONS A AND THEN THE FIRST PATIENT SHOULD BE DON SOME TIME IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ORLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN WE GON TRY TO RECOVER BLINDNESS IN THIS INVOLVS MAKING AN INJECTION OF A OF AVIRISINTO THE EYE RIGHT THE RAY NOW THERE'S NOWAY THAT I AM AWARE OF TO MANIPULATE THESE CHENCH CRIPSTHAN FACTORS THROUGH AP HILL OR OR SOME OTHER THAT'S WHAT WE WORKING ONIN MY LAD AT HARVARD RIGHT NOW SO IT WILL RELACE YOU ONVEATION OF CHURCH CRIPTIO  ONLY UPO PILL IN THE WHLE BODY GETS REJUVENATED BY TWENTY YEARS THAT'S WHAT WERE AIMING FOR NOW WE DO IT WIH GEN THERAPY IN THE EYE AND OTHER PLACES AH SOING THE I YES IT'S SINGLE INJECT SIAN THE GENES GO INTO THE RET IN A AND WE CAN TURN IT ON WITH THE DRUG COLDUXY SYCLIN AND WE DO THAT IN THE MICE FOR FOUR TO EIGHT WEEKS THE THE EYE GETS YOUNGER WE CAN MEASURE THAT O CAN MEASURE THE CLOCK HAND THEN THE THE VISION COMES BACK IN THOSE MICE AND I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY IT SHOULDN'T WORK IN PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME STRUCTURES AND MECHANISMS THAT ARE ON IN THE HUMAN IS WELL NOW THE END IT'S ONE INJECTION IT'S ISH IMAGINE AT INJECTIONS INTO THE EYE IOBVIOUSLY NOBODY SHOULD DO THIS OUTSIDE OF A ATHOMOLOGY CLINIC UM AND THERE DEATINLY BY AN OPTHOMOLOGIST BUT AM H THE INJECTIONS INTOTHE IYERE PAINLESS HAF DONE CORRECTLY BY THE RIGHT PERSON IT SOUNDS DREADFUL BUT IT'S ACTUALLY I'VE SEEN IT DONE HUNDRS OF TIMES I'VE DONE IT THOUSANDS OF TIMES AND IT'S AH NOT TO MYSELF BUT AT OTHER CREATURES AND THERE'S A WAY OF DOING THIS AS COMPLETELY PAINLESS TO THE PERSON UDER FIL IT'S A TINY TINY NEEDLE TO BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT'S A ONE TIME TREATMENT THOSE GENES GOING TO THE BACK OF THE IRON STAY THERE FOR EVER AND YOU CAN JUST TURN THEM ON WHENIVER YOU WANT SO WHAT WE FOUND AS YOU CAN TURN THEM ON IN THE MICE THEY GET THE VISION BACK AND THEN YOU TURN IT OFF AGAIN AND SO FAR MANY MONTHS OLT THE BENEFIT AS REMAIN BUT IF IT DOES DECLINE WE JUST TURN IT BACK ON AND RESET THE SYSTEM RINGSAN REPEAT SO ONE DAY WHAT'S EXCITING IS THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY DO THIS ACROSS THE ENTIRE BODY AH AND JUST TAKE THIS ANTIBODIC EFERE FIVE YEARSAND GO BACK TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN THINKING ABOUT THE BODY AND WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE  I'M AMAZED STILL THAT THERE ISN'T A SIMPLE AFFORDABLE TEGNOLOGY THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO JUST LOOK INTO MY BODY AND SEE WHETHER NOTHER ANY TUMORS GROWING ANYWHERE IT IT'S NOT THAT HORRID TO LOOK INTO THE BODY MEN THAT THE TECNOLOGY EXISTS WHY WHY HASN'T ANYBODY CREATED AN AT HOME OR SUITO AT HOME SOLUTION LIKE A CLINIC WHERE YOU CAN GO AND PAY FIFTY BOX OR A UNDRED BOX AND SEE IF YOU OF ANY TUMORS GROWN YET'S IT'S STILL EXPENSIVE YOU CAN GET YOUR DOCTOR TO TRY OR GET YOU IN AS SOME COMPANIES THAT OFF E BLOOD TEST THAT LOOK AT CIRCULATING DE IN AY THEY'LL MEASURE IT WE GETTING THERE ITS STILL PRENTY FIVE TO TEN YEARS AWAY FROM BEING REALLY CHEAP A YOU CAN DO THINGS LIKE A COLINCANSOR TEST AT HOME I THINK IT SO HUNDN SOMETHING DOLLARS YOU YOU SHIP OFF YOUR SHIP ASK USE MY LANGUAGE AND THEY MEASURE IT AND TH THEY TELL YOU IF YOU GOT CONCANCILER WITH HIGH PROBABILITY I DID THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE I DIDN'T WONT TO GET A COLONOSCOPY IS IT MORE ACCURATE OR AS ACCURATE AS A KOLONOSK I BELIEVE IT'S CLOSE TO BEING IS ACCURATE THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT DURING A COLONOSCOPY THEY CAN PINCH OFF THE PULLIPS THAT ARE LOOKING DANGEROUS RIS THIS OBVIOUSLY ISN'T THAT ABUT IT' CERTAINLY EASIER TO DO AND MY FATHER WHO'S A STRATIAN TELLS ME THAT IT'S FREE FOR STRALANS THEY GET THIS TEST ROUTINELY INTERESTING U I WANT A RETURN TO THE TOPIC THAT I TOOK US AWAY FROM SO I APOLOGIZE WHICH IS BEHAVIORAL A PROTOCALLS YOU REGULARLY DO THE COLD SHOWERS THING ICE BATHS COLD WATER SWIMS OR YOV INTO THAT HORE IS AA A WELL YOU YOU DO KNOW THAT I'VE DONE IT AT LEAST ONCE  WE DIT IT TOGETHER THAT'S RIGHT NOT THE SAME BATHS JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR SAME SAON A DIFFERENT ICE PATHE IDEA OF SAINT CLARE AN HURERMAN TAKING ICE BAT TOGETHERS A IT MIGHT WARM SOME PEOPLE'S HEARTS BUT A WIT JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR DIFFERENT SAME ICE FAT DIFFERENT AM DIFFERENT TIMES YE THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING AAHI DON'T DO THEM REGULARLY I I I DO TRY TO SLEEP COOL I I SLEEP BETTER ANYWAY I TRY TO DRESS WITHOUT A LOT OF WARM CLOTHES I'M HERE IN A TISHIRT AND'SMITTLE OF SUMMER THATTIN WINTRILL TRY TO WEAR TISHOR TO TO YOUR CHALLENGING YOUR SYSTEM TO THER MO REGULATE RIGHT RIGHT I'VE GOT THIS A HYPOTHESIS  WITH GRAY CRONS WE PUBLISHED WHAT'S CALLED THE METABOLIC WINTER HYPOTHESIS WHICH IS IF YOU TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO WEERE EITHER HUNGRY OR COLD OR BOTH AND WE REALLY EXPERIENCE THAT NOW AND SO WETRY TO GIVE OURSELVES THE THE METABOLIC WINTER AND PART OF THE PROBLEM I THINK WITH THE OBESCITY EM EPIDEMIC IS THAT WE'RE NIVER COLD AND COLD WHEN YOU COLD YOU AFTER BURN ENERGY IT MAY BE ONLY SLIGHTLY BUT OVER THE WHOLE NIGHT IF YOUR LITTE BUT COOL YOU'L ACTUALLY SPEND MOR ENERGY SO I TRY TO DO THAT BUT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF COLD SHOWERS THE SONA I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MY GIM AS MUCH AS I DID I BUT I DO ONE TO GET BACK INTO IT I USED TO DO IT REGULARLY WITH MY SON AND I POSTED ON INS TO GRAMONTE A THAT HE COULD STAY IN THERE FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND I COULD ONLY STAY IN FR ABOUT THREE A IT LOOKS VERY SHORT  I I TRY TO COMPENSATE WITH CHANGES IN MY DIE AND EXERCISE UNTIL I GET BACK INTO IT YOU REMIND ME OF SOMETHING THAT I'VE MEANT TO ASK EARLIER THAT OBESITY REDUCES AN  D LEVELS AND ACCELERATES AGIN HOW I MEAN O GESO THE GADNESS IS THAT THA THE SCIENCE IST IN IN AS YOU KNOW IT SO SOME ONES CARRYING A LOT OF  EXCESS OUT OF POST TISSUES THE SUBTUTANEOUS AND A VICERAL FAT IM BUT WHY SHOULD THAT REDUCE AN AD IN ANY WAYS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF EFFECTS ON GUCOS AND INSOONT IF IT YOU KNOWIS TERE SOMETHING DIRECT ABOUT WHITE OUT OF POST TISSUE AND TE REASON I ASK THIS IS NOT SIMPLY TO DIG IN TE MECHANISM ALONE BUT I THINK THE'RE REALLY INTERESTING DATE NOW THAT FAT ACTUALLY GETS NORAL INNURVATION I MEAN IT'S C IT'S A IT'S NOT JUST AT IT'S IT IT'S NOT JUST STORED FUEL IT'S STORED FUEL THAT'S ACTING AS AN ENDICRANT ORGAN ASANTIALLY SO IM YET WHY WOULD BEING FAT  MAKE PEOPLE A FASTER YES THAT'S A QUESTION THAT IT'S SO OBVIOUS BUT SO FEW PEOPLE ASK IT THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU GOOD SCIENTIST AND SO THAT WE DON'T KNOW BUT I'LL GIVE YOU MY BEST ANSWER WHICH IS THAT  OBESITY COMES ALONG WITH A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT I INCLUDE LOT OF SINESSENCSELVES IN FAT IF YOU STAIN OLD FAT FOSNESSENCSELVES IT LIGHTS OUT AND WHEN YOU KILL OFF THOS SELLS AT LEAST IN MICE AND MAY BE IN HUMANS IT LOOKS LIKE O THE FACT IS LESS TOXIC TO THE BODY CAS THOSE SENIZEN SELLES IN THE FAT ARE SECRETING THESE INFLAMETRY MOLECULES THAT WILL EXCELERATE AGING AS WE NO NO YOU TOOK ABOUT THE SURTUINS IN AN ADY A SOF WE IF WE JUST LOOK PHILOSOPHICALLY AT WHY THIS WOULD BE THE SURTUANS ONLY LIKE TO COME ON OR GET ACTIVATED WHEN THE BODY NEEDS IS THAT IS UNDER ADVERSITY AND IF A SELL IS SURROUNDED BY FAT OR CONTAINS A LOT OF FAT IT'S GIN A THING TIMES A GOOD DOESN'T NEED TO SWITCH ON SO THAT'S THE EVOLUTIONARY ARGUMENT MECHANISTICALLY WE DON'T KNOW BUT IT COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RESPONSE TO GLUCOS WHICH THEN RESPONDS TO THE SURTUNGINE BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN WORKED OUT VERY WELL AND THERE IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT LEPT IN THIS HORMON FROM FAT CAN ACTUALLY OM INTERACT WITH THE SURTUAN PATHWAY I DON'T RECALL SEEING THAT MAYECU DO A SYBATICAL ON YOUR LAP AND THE THAT BE A FUN ONE DEFINITELY BECAUSE LEPT IN DURING DEVELOPMENT IS WHAT TRIGGERS THE THE PERMISSION FOR THE HYPOTHALEMUST ANTER PUBRITY I YES IS WHY KIDS THAT THAT EATAL LOT WHEN THEIR YOUNG AND GET OVER WEIGHT WILL ALSO STARTO GOIN UNDERGO PUBRITYING WORK QUICKLY ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES LATER WE YE WE SHOULD STUDY THE HYTHALEMUS TOGETHERS THE HYPOTHALEMIS IS CAN CONTROL THE AGING F TH BODY THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF THE BRAY ET SURE YET ALU IF IF YOU TURN ON THE SORT LONGING THE SURTUNGIN THT WE WORK ON IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS HAT ACTUALLY WILL EXTEND LAST MAN ALSO IT'S BEEN SHOWN BY DUNCTIANCAI O ATALBONA ALBONIN SANCOTA MEDICN I FEW INHIBIT INFLAMMATION IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS IN A MOUSE IT WILL INCREASE OR MAINTAIN THE EXPRESSION OF WHAT'S CALLED GE AN OUR AGE WHICH IS THE HORMON THAT  HE FOUND ACTUALLY CONTROLS ALON GEVITY IN THE MOUSE IN PART AND SO KEEPING INFLAMMATION DOWN IN THE HYPOTHALMUS IS SUFFICIENT TO EXTEND THE LAST PAN OF ANIMALS AND I REVIEW THAT PAP OR FE NATUR O ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO AND THAT WAS THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION THAT THE HYPOTHALEMUS IS ONE OF THE LEADING REGULATORS OF THE BODY'S AGE I FIND THIS FASCING GAN OR AGE OM FOR THOSE YE OR NO ASHY COMES FROM NURONS IN THE HPOTHALEMUS THAT THEN LITERALLY REACH GOWN IN TO THE PETUITARIAN TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT CONTROL FERTILITY LUDINIZING HORMON FOR THE FOLICAL STIMULATINE HORMON ET CETERA  SUCH A POWERFUL SET OF NERANS AND IT'S NEVER REALLY BEEN CLEAR WHAT AT A BEHAVIOR OR LEVEL TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF GIANAR AGE OM THERE'S ALL THE STORIES ABOUT FERMONS AND TIMERS AN PUBRITY ET CETERA BUT I ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND DIETARY CONDITIONS AND BEHAVIORS THAT CAN CONTROL GANARAE RULEAS I THINK I IS AN INCREDIBLE VARIA FOR FOR EXPLORATION I'VE LEFT TO DO THAT SYMANICAL BY THE WAY AVOCABLE A SEEMINGLY RANDOM QUESTIONS BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT ASK BECAUSE ONE THING I LIKE TO DO AS FORAGE THE INTERNETE FOR PRACTICIS THAT AT LEAST MORE THAN A FEW PEOPLE ARE DOING AND AND THEN WONDER WHETHER NOT THERE'S ANY BASIS FOR IT A YOU MENTION METHELATION AS A A DETRIMENTAL PROCESS THE WAY IT DISTRUPTS THE EPEGENOM THE THE SEEDY READER SO TO SPEAK THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE INJESTING MATHELINE BLUE AND WHEN I WAS A KID I USED METHELINE BLUE TO CLEAN MY FISHTANK AND I LOWFISH THANKS I KNOW YOU'RE INTEA QUARIA ALSO AA DIFFERENT PARGAS EPOSODE TOUK ABOUT A QUARIA BUT WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD PEOPLE IN JEST MATHELINE BLUE IT MEANING IS THEIR LOGIC CORRECT AND OR IS THAT A DANGEROUS PRACTISE I I'M NOT TRIED ONE EN JEST MATHELINE BLUE SOUNDS NI LIKE A BAD THING TO DO IT STAINS YOUR BODY YOU SEEIN YE WHEN YOU UD YE THERE WAS A  SOME ONE IN MY LAT AH AS A POSTAC WAS USING IT TO STUDY A COMPLETE DIFFERENT PROCESS RELATE THE BLOOD RAIN BARRIER IND EUSTER INJECT IN TO ANIMALS AND THEY WOULD TURN BLUE UT THEN AGAIN PEOPLE IN JEST CORLOID SILVER YOO THEY'LL PUT IN THERE THERE'S AS PLEASE PEOPLE DON'T DO THIS OR IF YOU DO JUST DON'T TELL ME ACAUSE I WON'T LIKE IT THEY PEOPLE PUT IT IN THEIR EYES AND SOME PEOPLE AUTALLY STAIN THEIR SKIN THEY AC SHOULD BECOME KIND OF AT THIS SILVER PURPLE BROWN COLOR IF THEY DO IT EXCESSIVELY I'M INTHERE LOT OF CRAZY STUFF OUT THERE A BOOK WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE THINKING WITH THIS METHELINE BLUE THING OR SHOUD WE JUST GET THEM TO A GOOD PSYCHIATRISE A I DON'T KNOW ASHORE I THINK METHLINE BLUE IS FOUND TO EXTEND THE LIFE MAND OF SOME LOWER OVANISM AND THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM MY RECOLLECTION WITH THE EMPHASIS ON LOWER WORD YES A SMALLER OGANISMS A I THINK DOESN'T YOU REMEMBER ANDED IS'IN INTERRUPT INTERFERE WITH MITY CONREAL ACTIVITY IND THAT IS EEN MY LI LIGERING IT YE WE WE NEED TO LOOK THIS OPIN POSTAD OGA WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS BUT THOSE METHELS THAT'S TALK ABOUT THE YE A THOSE METHELS HAVE TO BE PLACED ON THE RIGHT PART OF THE GENO THEY GET ATTACHED TO THE RIGHT GINES AND THE RONGINES AND IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF METHELATION IT'S GET A MESOP THE EPEGENO A SMOKING WILL DO THAT A LIKEVICSISE OR LIKWIDSTOFF SO WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO DO AS YOU WANT A MEASURE IT AND MAKE SURE WHAT YOUR DOING WITH YOUR BODY IS WORKING HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU DO THIS OR THAT IS ACTUALLY HELPING  AND SO YOU CAN YOU CAN TEST YOUR AGE I COULD TAKE A SWAB FROM YOUR MOUTH AND TELL YOU HOW OLD YOU ARE BY OLOGICALLY AND THEN WE COULD WORK ON TWENTY BRING THAT DOWN AND EXTUALLY THERE ARE ANECDOTES NOW AH THAT PEOPLE ARE REVERSING THEIR AGE BY A DECADE OR MORE  JUST BY DOING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND SME OTHER CUTTING EDGESTOFF THAT A I'M GET T RIDE ABOUT A BUT YET BUT YOU HAVE TO MEASURE STUFF THAT'S UDIDN'T WANT TO FORGET TO BRING THAT OT I I MEASURING STOFFOR THE TIME I HAVE BLOOD TESTS LIKE YEUR ABOUT THIS MONATER THAT STUCK TO MY CHEST RIGHT NOW THAT'S MEASURING MYSELF A THOUSAND TIMES A SECOND AND I MEASURE MY BIOLOGICAL AGE WHAT'S IT MEASURING A THOUSAND TIMES A SECOND OMOST OF THIM YEA A ALSO THIS THIS LITTLE DEVICE IS STOCK HERE AND IT'S FOR TWO WEEKS IT YOU JUST RECHARGE IT WI'LL SEND IT BACK GIN YOU ONE IT'S GOT A BODY TEMPERATURE MOVEMENT HAT RAT VERYABILITY IT'S AN EFTY A A PROVE DEVICE IT'S NOT A TOY IT'S NOT ONE OF THESE RECREATION AL THINGS AH IT ALSO LISTENS TO MY VOICE EVENTUALLY'LL TELL ME IF I NEED A PSYCHOTRIS OR IT I'M DEPRESSED AH IT WILL TELL ME HOW I SLEEP OBVIOUSLY BUT WHEN YOU PUT A THAT DATE TOGETHER AND IT'S INDIVIDUALIZED AND ANONOMIZED IF CAN NOW TELL MY DOCTOR IN REAL TIME IF I'VE GOT A COLD THAT NEEDS AN ANTIBODIC OR ITS JUST ABIROUS A IF I AM I'M SUFFERING FROM PROVEIN NINETEEN OR EVEN IF A I'M GET HAVE A HARTITACK NEXT WEEP AND SO THESE LITTLE DEVICES I  GOING TO BE WITH US ALL THE TIME INSTEAD OF GOING TO YOUR DOCTOR ONCE A YEAR WHICH IS LUDICROUS I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT EXRACE OS EVERY TIME I GO THROUGH THE SCANNER AT THE AIRPORT I THINK SAINT CLAIRE WOULD NEVER  DO THIS AND THE ARGUMENT I HEARD YOU GIVE ABOUT THIS BEFORE WAS A REALLY EXCELLENT ONE WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A LOW LEVEL AMOUNT OF RADIATION GOING THROUGH WITH THE AIRPORT BUT THE ARGUMENT AS ALWAYS WAS JUST AS MUCH AS ON THE PLAIN AND YOUR ARGUMENT YOUR COUNTER ARGUMENT I SHOULD SAY WAS WELL THEN WHY WOULD I WANTED YO BOTH IT I ULD SO WHEN YOU GO TO THE IRRPORT ASSUMING YOU'RE NOT RUNNING LATE AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE STANDARD LINE WHAT O YOU SAY TO THEM AND D' YOU SAY I'M DAVID SAINT CLARE AND THEN THEY A SRUTTLE YOU TO YOUR OWN LINE WHA DO YOU SAY YU'DYOU SAY I DON'T LIKE THIS THING DOYOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A REASON NO YOU DON'T YOU CAN SAY I DON'T WANT THIS AND THEY'LL GET ANNOYED ITS HARD FOR THEM TO PAT YOU DOWN BUT YOU GET A PAT DOWN IN YOU YOUR DON AS LONG AS Y U NOT IN A HARRY IT'S FINE IF YOU WANTA PAY FOR THE TE SA PRETY IN AMERICA THE WAY TO GET AROUND THOSE SCANERS YOU CAN DO THAT SO I TRAVEL A LOT SOT'S WORTH IT ANYWAY BUT I I JUST GO THROUGH THE MIDDLE DETECT I DON'T GET SCAN AND THE METAL DETECTOR DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME IM SAIME PROBLEM WHAT ABOUT EXRAYS AT THE DENTIST YEU WELL YOU KNOW ONE EXTRASE NOTHING TO KILL YOU TWO'S NOCKIN O KILL YOU BUT I BROLL KILL YOU NOW I'M JUST GETIN II TRY TO LIMIT IT BECAUSE IT'S CUMULATIVE R AND I WENT FOR OR SIX YEARS WITHOUT HAVING A DENTAL EXRAY AHAND THEN MY LOST VISIT I JIST GAVE UP IS TIRED OF ARGUING I DENTIST SO THEY GAVE ME ONE BUT THOR THEY'VE GOT LED COATS ON AND THEY PUT LATLE OF YOUR BODY THAT'S TELLING YOU SOMETHING RIGHT THERE AH AND FUNNLY ENOUGH MY TEETH HADN'T CHANGE NOW YOU COULD BALANCE THAT BY SAYING WELL ONE EX RAY TO EXRETHR EXTRACEIS WORTH IF I HAVE CAVITIES AND THAT'S TRUE YOU WNTA NOW IT'S IN THERE AH BUT DOING IT REGULARLY FOR ME I DON'T THINK WAS WORTH IT BECAUSE OT MY TEETHR IND PERFECT HEALTH AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN DON'T HAVE ANY CAVITIES DIN'T EMBRACE AS IF I SO STOP SCANNING ME I MAN I KNOW YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE MACHINE BUT N TO I'VE A CHOICE YES SO STOP PRESSURING ME YOU WHO SHARED YOUR SENTIMENTS ABOUT EXRAYS AND THE DENTIST IN GENERAL MY APOLOGIES TO THE DENTISTS OUT THERE WAS THE GREAT PHYSICISTS RICHARD FINEMENT AM THIS IS A STORY ABOUT HIM THAT'S NOT ESPECIALLY WELL KNOWN BUT HE HAD VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS A HEALTH CONCERNS ABOUT EXRAS BECOUMES HE UNDERSTOOD THE PHYSICS YOU UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH BIOLOGY THAT A HE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE VOCAL ABOUT HIS AM DISLIKE OF DENTL TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S DANGEROUS AND A HE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND THAT ON THE UNERNET AM IF THEY LIKE SPEAKING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE FINEMEN WHO BEEN ENGAGED IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE ABOUT SCIENCE A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT YOU IN FACT THE WAY THAT YOU NI INITIALLY CAME TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER IS THROUGH YOUR PUBLIC  EDUCATION ENFORTS SO A OBVIOUSLY WERE DOING THIS PODCAST YOU'V DONE THE YOUROGAN PODCASTE LIKES FREEDMAN POT FREEDMAN'S PODCASUS ME LIKES SOME STILL ADJUST IN THAT LEX FREEDMAN PODCAST MANY OTHER PODCAST YOU'RE IN AMAZING BOOK WHAT DO YOU THINKING THESE DAYS AND TERMS OF WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS IN TERMS OF EDUCATION FROM SCIENTIS EDUCATION FROM EMDIES EDUCATION IN GENERAL AS IT RELATES TO THESE THINGS BECAUSE YOU I THINK IF NOTHING ELSE TWENTY TWENTY REVEALED TO US THAT THERE'S A GAP THERE'S A GAP AND UNDERSTANDING AND THAT THE SCIENTIST TOO ARE GUILTY OF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE ON POBMATTER ELSEWHERE JUST AM AN WOULD YOU THINKING FOR YOURSELF AND IN GENERAL I'D LIKE TO JUST KNOW WHAT HE THINK THE WORLD NEEDS THERE MAY WE CAN A RECRUIT SOMEWHERE O PUBLIC EDUCATORS YOU WE WE WE'VE GONE FROM A TIME WHEN YOU AND I WERE IN COLLEGE AND YOUNG PROFESSES WERE THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUR VOICE OUT TO THE PUBLIC WAS EITHER THROUGH NEWSPAPER OR A VERY SHORT RADIO INTOVIEU A WHICH FOR ME WAS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING PARTICULARLY THE NEWSPAPERS AND MY TAPIC EVERY TIME WAS TWISTED INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT JUST EMBARRASSING BUT HOW A UNIVERSITY USED TO BRING ME INTO THE BACK OFFICE AND FRANGLYN RESIGN HOW DIDN'T YOU SAY SUCH A THING ROGAN I LIVED ON I DIDN'T SAY THAT SO WE'RE NOW ALSO IN A WORLD WHERE OR OVERWHELMED WITH INFORMATION AND MOST OF IT IS WRONG AND ANY ONE CAN PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT SO WE'VE GONE FROM EARLY DAYS O NOW THE FUTURE AND WERE EXPERIENCING IT RIGHT NOW THANKS TO GUIDES LIKE YOU PEOPLE LIKE YOU IS THAT THE EXPERT SOME EXPERTS OF THE A SMALL NUMBER WHO ARE BRILLIANT ANGOOD COMMUNICATORS ARE TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC THIS IS NEVER BEING ABLE TO BE POSTLE UNTIL THIS TIME RITE NOW SO ANOTHER FIVE YE IS FROM NOW AND SUDDENLY BY TEN YEARS I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE ARE TRUSTED SOURCES OF INFORMATION OF PEOPLE WHO CNOT JUST COMMUNICATE THE IDEAS DIRECTLY BUT ARE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON THER'REARONOT EVEN PUBLISHED YET TO SAY HE IS WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON AND THIS IS WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE BUT THIS IS SOMEBODY LIKE YOURSELF WHO SPENT THEIR WHOLE LIFE STUDYG A PARTICULAR TOPIC AND KNOWS WHAT THEY TALKING ABOUT AND THIS THIS IS ALL IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT WE SCIENTISTS IF WE TELL A LIE WE BURST INTO FLAMES WE ABSOLULY CANNOT TELL SOMETHING THAT'S UNTRUE AND TO THE BEST ABOUT KNOWLEDGE WE SAY IT AS IT IS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WERD BEATEN UP AND WE  WE KEEPED OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY S THE PEOPLE WHO SURVIVE TO OUR AGE AND I'M A LITTL OLDER THAN YOU SUFSIVIVED BET LONGER BUT A LOT YOUNGER INSIDE TWE HAVE TO MEASURE YOU WITH MY DOWING E O A PRIDIN YO A LITTLE HELP OTFULLY NOT TOO MUCH YOU MEASURE THAT AND AND A WELL WORK ON ON YOUR EATING BUT THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT FINALLY PEOPLE LIKE YOUR ARE ALLOWED BY OUR UNIVERSITIES TO TALK TO THE PUBLIC I USED TO DO IT WITH E REAL THREAT TO MY SURVIVAL PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT ME ALWAYS ASSAILSMEN ES PROMOTING THIS AND THAT IT WAS SEEN AS A RUALE NEGATIVE E FINALL T THING WERE IN TA WORLD WHERE IT'S NOT NEGATIVE ANY MORE AND THE PANDEMIC SHOWED THAT WE NEED TO VOICES OF REASON VOICE IN THE VOICES OF FACT THAT YOU COULD TRUST AND I YOU CAN SEE THE POPULARITY OF YOUR POOTCOS SHOW IS THAT THE PUBLIC ARE THE DESPERATE FOR FACTS THAT THEY CAN TRUST WAS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE ANY MORE WELL I BEING COMPLETELY HONEST WHAT I SAY THIS THAT YOU KNOW I FOLLOWED YOUR LEAD I SAW YOU ON THE JOROGAN PODCAST AND MY JAW JOB I'S LIKE THIS IS AMAZING LIKE THIS BECAUSE A YET AT OTHER GOOD SCIENTISTS ON BEFORE BUT YOU'RE YOU TENDEUR PROFESSOR ARVARD CENETICS DEPARTMENT AF GENETICS AND FOR THOSE ARE YOU DON'T KNOW A THERE'S THE HARVARD AND OF COURSE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THEY'RE BOTH EXCELLENT OF COURSE AH BUT IS OT THE TOP TOP TEARS OF A VACADAMI AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THERE AND SURVIVE THERE AND TO TO THRIVE THERE IT'S LIKE A A GAME OF PINBALL YOU NEVER WIN YE JUST YOU JUST GET O IF YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL YOU GET TO KEEP PLAYING THAT'S THE TRUTH IN ACADAMIA IF YOU'RE NOT YOU STOP PLAYING BASICALLY BUT WHEN I SAW YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN A WAY THAT WAS ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLE PROTOCALS THAT THEY MIGHT EXPLORE FOR THEMSELVES TO SEE IF THOSE WERE A RIGHT FOR THEM I WAS JUST A I WAS JUST DAZZLED AND EXCITED AND I MADE EVERY EFFORT TO GET IN CONTACT WITH YOU AND AND YOU KNOW THE REST IS IS HISTORY BUT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING TO ME THESE DAYS IS BECAUSE OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WHAT EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPEN AND CONTINUES TO HAPPEN THERE'S A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE THERE'S ALSO THIS DIRECT TO THE PUBLIC A ROUT THAT YOU MENTIONED AND AND I THINK THERE'S ALSO AN OPENNESS AM AND LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S AN OPENNESS N A FROM T E GENERAL PUBLIC ABOUT HEALTH PRACTICES THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO CONTROL THEIR STRASTS LEVEL TO CONTROL UM THER SLEEP TO CONTROL THEIR COLLESTERALL IF THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED TO DO MAYBE THEY DON'T AM AND TO YOVEN CONTROL THEIR LIFE SPAN WHICH I THINK IS REMARKABLE AND YOU KNOW I KNOW I SPEEK ON BEHALF OF SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN I JUST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU YOU'VE IT TRULY CHANGE THE COURSE OF OF MY LIFE I WOULD NOT BE SITTING HERE DOING THIS WERE NOT FOR YOUR EXAMPLE AND I ALWAYS SAY SIN CLAIRE MANY PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN BOOKS MANY ACADEMICS HAVE WRITTEN BOOKS AS YOU HAVE BUT IN TERMS OF DOING PODCASTS AND REALLY GETTING OUT THERE WITH YOUR MESSAGE IN A WAY THAT I HAVE TO ASSUME RAISED YOUR QUARTERS AL LEVEL AND HEART RATE JUST A LITTLE BIT A BUT YOU DID IT NON THE LAST IM YOU KNOW YOU WERE TRULY FIRST MAN IN AND THAT THAT DESERVES A A NOD AND AND  I'VE A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO YOU FOR THAT SO THANK YOU SOI SHANKS ANDER YOU'RE A YOUVE BECOME A GOOD FRIEND AND I I'M SUPERPROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN WHAT YOU I KNOW WHAT YOU WILLER SO IN ADDITION TO YOUR BOOK AND YOUR PRESENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN SEGRAM AND TWITTER AND APPEARANCES ON PODCASTS RECENTLY IVE NOTICE THAT YOU'VE AM OPEN UP A A SORT OF EMAL SLASH WEBSIHT THAT PEOPLE CAN ASK A ACCESSCUSE ME UM TO GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH AND RATES OF AGING A TELL US ABOUT THAT AND UM WHAT'S BEING MEASURED AND A WHAT IS THIS A TEST THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON I SEGRETLY AND NOW SOON NOT SO SEGRELY YE WILL THIT WHAT I WANT IS IS A CRITISC OR FOR THE BODY TO MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW THEIR HEALTH AND THERE IS A NUMBER THERE'S AT AS A BIOLOGICAL AGE THAT YOU CAN MEASURE UNFORTUNATELY THE TEST AS MANY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS RIGHT NOW BUT A IN MY LIVE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING THAT DOWN A LOT AND SO I WANT O DEMOCRATIZE THIS TEST SO THAT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO A SCORE FOR THE HEALTH THAT CAN PREDICT THE NOT JUST THE FUTURE HEALTH AND TIME OF DEATH BUT TO CHANGE IT AND I'M BUILDING A SYSTEM THAT WILL POINT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND GIVE THEM DISCOUNTS FOR SUDDEN THINGS THAT WILL IMPROVE NOT JUST THEIR HEALTH NOW BUT TEND TWENTY THIRTY IS INTO THE FUTURE AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT AND VERY CHEOPLY KEEP MEASURING IT TO KNOW THAT OU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK CAUSE IF YOU DON'T MEASURE SOMETHING YOU CON OPTIMIZE IT AND SO THIS IS THE BIOLOGICAL AGE TEST WE'VE DEVELOPED IT IT'S A SIMPLE MOUTH SWAB A WE ROLLING IT OUT I WULD BUILDING THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW AND THERE IS A SIGN UP SHEEP AUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO GET IN LINE I GO TO DOCTO SING CLEIR DOT COME YOU CAN GET ON THAT AND YOU'LL BE ONE OF THOST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO GET THIS TEST AND SEE WHAT WERE DOING O FANTASTIC WILL PEOPLE BE CELEBRATING THEIR A BIOLOGICALE AGE BIRSTDAYS IN OTHER WORDS IF I'M MINDNESS LIKE IF I COULD MATGE I'M FORTY FIVE RIHT NOW SOON BE FORTY SIX BUT IF MY IF I WERE TO BE SO LUCKY AS TO GET MY BIOLOGICAL AGE TO THIRTY FIVE UM WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS MAYBE CAN HELP ME DO THAT DO I GET TO CELEBRATE A A A NEGATIVE BIRTDAY ABSOLUTELY N MY PLAN IS THE THOSE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THEIR AGE BACK A YEAR OR MORE WE THINK WE CAN GO BACK TWENTY YEARS EVENTUALLY THEY'LL GET A BUT THEY COD FOR ME AND IT'S A NEGATIVE BIT THEY CAR I LOV IT AND T PROBABLY VERY LITTLE ACTUAL BIRTHDAY CAKE BEING INJESTED BUT WHO CARES CAUSE YOU ARE LIVING THAT MUNCH LON IS PHILISTAVIAR THAT'LL BE FIND AND THANK YOU FOR TALKING US TO DAY I I REALIZE I TOOK US DOWN DEEP INTO THE GUTSM OF MECHANISM AND AND AS WELL TALKING ABOUT GLOBAL PROTOCALLS EVERYTHING FROM WHAT ONE CAN DO AND TAKE IF THEY CHOOSE THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM OM TO HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS THAT THAT WE ON TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LIFE SPIN ASAM

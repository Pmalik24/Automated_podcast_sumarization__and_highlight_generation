RACE TO REPLACE THE SPEAKER IS ON AGAIN THE RECRIMINATIONS HAVE ONLY BEGUN AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE FACT THE MATTER IS THIS WAS A STUPID FIGHT THAT THAT CHOOSE NOTHING IT'S ALL ABOUT AN SENT O STRUCTURES AS I SUGGESTED YESTERDAY ON THE SHOW ITS NOT ABOUT KEMICARTY BEING A BAD SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE THE TRUTH IS WASN BOUT PAURYAN BEING A BAD SPEAKER OF THE OUSE MAKE A BETTER CASE THAT WAS BANER BEING A BAD SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IN ALL THE SITUATIONS THESE THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN OUSE DED LARGELY BECAUSE OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT AND THEN UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL CAUKIS WHOEITHER HAVE ON REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OR WHO ARE FIBBING TO THEIR OWN CROWD SEE FOR POLITICIANS IT'S THE INTENTIVE STRUCTURE IS ALWAYS TO TELL YOUR OWN PEOPLE THE THINGS THEY WANT TO HERE AND WHAT YOUR PEOPLE WONT HERE IS IF THEY VOTE FOR YOU THEY WILL GET THE SUN THE MOON IN THE STARS IF THEY VOTE FOR YOU YOU WILL BEABLE TOGIVE THEM EVERYTHING AN POSSIBLY HAVE WANTED AND TEN WHEN THAT DULSNT MATERIALIZE YOUAVE A COUPLE OF CHOICES ONE IS YOU COUN BE HONEST WITH THEM HEU TILLUSEN WE DID THE BEST THAT WE COULD WE GOT THE MOST THAT WE CAN THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT YOU'RE GOIN T BE OUTFLANK BY SOME ONE ELSE WHO'S GOING TO COME ALONG AND PROMISE THEM THE SUN THE MOON AND THE STARS SE UNEITHER ALI ON THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR VOTING BASE WHICH YOU GOULD DO AND I THINK THE MOST HONEST AND BEST POLITICIANS DO DO THAT IS ILLISTET WE'RE SHOOTING FOR ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND STEAD WE GOT EIGHTY PER CENT WE GOT SIXTEEPER SENT THAT'S ALL WE COUL GET BECAUSE THAT'S THE REALITY OF LIFE BUT IT DOES PUT YOU IN THE POLITICAL DANGER OF BEING OUT FLANK BY SOME ONE WHO'S GOING TO PROMISE YOU EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AND THE WAY THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO KEEP MEMBERS IN LINE TO KEEP THEM FROM DOING THIS SORT OF STUFF ORIGINALLY WAS THAT THE PARTY STRUCTURES WERE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MEANING THAT THEY COULD DENY YOU MONEY THAT IF YOU IF YOU CROSS THE PARTY THE PARTY COULD PUNISH YOU IN SOME WAY WELL AS THE PARTIES HAVE BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IMPORTANT IN AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE AND BY THAT I MEAN THE PARTIES EXERT VIRTUALLY NO PULL OVER THEIR MEMBERS ANY MORE THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE IN THE R PUBLICAN PARTYS LESS TRUE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHERE AO SEE WILL FOLLOW NANCY PLOSY NOT BECAUSE SHOU LOVES NANY PLOSY BUT BECAUSE NANCY BLOSY HAS THE POWER TO PUNISHER OR DID UNTIL VERY RECENTLY WE IN TE REPUBLICAN PRTY THERE'S NO POWER TO PUNISH IN FACT IT'S PRECISELY THE OTHER WAY AROUND IN ORDER FOR SPEAKER MAC CARTHY TO A BECOME SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE CAN MAKE PROMISES TO A VERY SMALL COOTERY OF MEMBERS OF HIS OWN CAUKAS BIGHT BE VAST MINORITY OF IS OWN CAUKAS THAT A SINGLE PERSON COULD INITIATE A VOTE TO TAKE DOWN THE SPEAKER HE HAD TO DO THAT NOR TO GET THE SPEAKERSHIP  THIS WILL HAT PUT HIM AN INHERENTLY WEAK POSITION SO HERE IS THE PROBLEM NOW WHEN PEOPLE SAY OH  ONE PLACE MC CARTHY WAS SOE ON BTTER FINE LET'S SAY THHE GET CHIM JORDAN I LOVE JHIM JORN GIM JORDANS GREAT REPRESENTATIVE FROM OHIOES ON THE HOUSE OVERCIDE COMMITTE IS REAL BULL DOG AND OWN PERSONALLY HE'S GREAT OR LET'S GET SHE GET STEEVE SCHOOLIES STEEVES TERRIFIC I REAL LIKES TEE BLOT LET'S HE GET EITHER ONE OF THOSE GUIS AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IF THE SAME RULES APPLID TO THEM THAT APPLIED TO CEVEN MCCARTHY IT WILL NOT MATTER IF THEY ARE QUONNPOOT BETTER THAN CEVEN MACARTHY BECAUSE IN THE END WLET'SAY IT COMES DOWN TO ANOTHER CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND YOU ARE ONE OF THESE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HO IS NOT BEHOLD INSYUR PARTY BUT WHO DOES MAKE HAY BY FIBBINGS YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT THE SON THE MOON IN THE TARS OR POSSIBLE WELL YOU CAN JUST DO THE SAME THING TO JIM JORDAN YOU CALL HIM MORINO HOU SAY WAY WAY YOU WARN'T WILLING TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER SPENDING THAT'S BECAUE YOUARE IN SUFFICIENTLY CONSERVATIVE YOU YOU MUST BE OUSTED SO THE ONLY WAY THIS GETS BETTER IRONICALLY IS FOR MATGATES TO HAVE ALL OF HIS POWER TAKIN AWAY BY THE NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY SPEAKER THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS WORKS THE ONLY WAY THIS GETS BETTER IS JIM JORDAN IN MAKING THE DEAL TO BE COME SPEAKER BASICALLY RENAGS ON ALL THE THINGS THAT CO MC CARTHYE PROMISED INCLUDING THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO CHALLENGE TO SPEAKERSHIP WITH ONE VOTE A THE OTHERWISE THIS JUST CENT TO KEEP HAPPENING ALL IT TAKES IS ONE ALL TAKES IS LIKE FIVE BECAUSE THE HOUSE MAJORITY OR THE REPUBLICANS IS SO DAMNED SLIM BY THEWAY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT' SO UNBELIEVABLY SLIM AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT WAS SUP POSED TO BE AFTER THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE WHICH WAS YOU KNOW A THIRTY SEAT HOUSE MAJORITY FOR THE REPUBLICANS THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP BACK TY BUNCH OF REALLY BAD CANDIDATES IN PURPLE DISTRICTS AND THEY LOST THAT IS THE REASON IN FACT MODERATE RE PUBLICANS ONE IN NEW YORK IF THEY WERE GOD CANDIDATES FLORIDA THEY DID REALLY WELL LLOUT OF THER PLACE IN THE COUNTRY THEY LOST VERY TIGHT RACES IN LARGE PARPBICAS THEY WERE VERY VERY TRUMPY AND THEY OFFENDED A LOT OF THOSE SWING VOTERS IN THE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT REPUBLICANS DID NOT WINSENITEATS IN SAY ARIZONA OR IN GEORGIA OR IN PENNSYLVANIA SO THE THE THE PROBLEM IS STEMACH IS THE POINT THAT I MAKIN TAND SO TO PRETEND THAT THIS IS A PRINCIPAL TO ACT BY MATGATES IN COMPANY TO OUST MC CARTHY AND THA IF WE GET SOME ONE BETTER IN THERE THAT'S CON O FIX ALL OUR PROMISE NOW WE'LL GET SPENDING UNDER A CONTRAL NOT TRUE IT'S NOT TRUE AT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THEN YOU ARE JUST GOING T KEEP GETTING SUCCORED BTHIS A POINT MADE BY REPRESENT OF CLOUDYATENNY SHE IS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM IT NEW YORK AND AGAIN SHE'S FROM NEW YORK WHICH MEANS SHE'S VULNERABLE NOW YOU MAY SAY WHET SHE SHE'S A RY NOW HOW HOW COULD SHE NOT ONE OF LOERS SHE DOES ONE LORS MENNN SHE'S ALSO FROM IT NEW YORK AND HERE'S THE THING YOU WANT A NATIONAL MAJORITY OR DO YOU PREFER WHO KEIN JEFFREYS TO BE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IF YOU WOULD LIKE THE RE PUBLICANS TO BE IN CHARGE OF CONGRESS YOU NEED PEOPLE LIKE CLAUDYETTENNY IN CONGRESS SHE'S IN A SWING DISTRICT HERE'S CLODOTTENNY WE WOULDN'T HAVE  SUPENA THE DOCUMENTS WE WOULD' AV HAD G SINCE SMITHIS CHAR THE HOUSEWAYS A MEANS COMMITTEE WHO OPEN THE MISTLE BLOWER CORDAL WE WOULD NEVER AVE KNOWN WHAT THESE LISTLE LOERS BROUGHT FOR NOW UNDER UNDER TO RASS UNDER THREAT OF THEIR JOBS WE WOULD NOT KNOW ANY OF TE S NON OF THIS MEN O MC CARTHY HADN'T BEEN SPEAKER AN IT'S NT ABOUT HAVIN TA CARTHE THESE PEOPLE ARE GING A WHOLE HOSSTAGE WHOEVER THE NEXT SPEAKER IS AND THAT IS RIGHT THAT IS RIGHT SO I WOULD HOPE THE WETHER IS JIM JORNOR SEEVSCLEES WHOEVER BECOMES THE NEXT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE THE DICTATE IS I NEED I'M NOT I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN ALOW EMOTION TO HIT THE FLOOR UNLESS A MAJORITY OF THE RE PUBLICAN COCKAS WANTIT I'M NOT GON TO DO IT I'M NOT GAN TO HAVE A MOTION TO GET RID OF ME A SPEAKER UNLESS THERE'S A LARGE CONTINGENT YOU NIVES ON A MAJORITY A SIGNOFBE MYNORITY THAT DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE HERE I'M NOT GON TO DO IT FOR ONE VOTE MEN CAN DO FOR FOR VOTES AND THAT BY THE WAY SHOULD BE THE SAME THING OFFERED BY EVERY SPEAKER OF THE OUSE CANDID AN THE PROBAA YOU'VE COLLECT OF ACTION PROBIN THERE SO LET'S A STEEVSCHOLEES AND JORDAN DECIDE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SILIZON NEITHER OF US IS GOING TO TAKE THE SPEAKERSHO POSITION UNLESS WE CLAWBACKS FROM THE POWERS THAE MC CARTHY GAVE TO GATES AND CREW WELL ALLI'S GOING O TAKE THAT POINT IT'S FOR SOME ONE TO SWING IN FROM THE RIGHT AND SA NOI'LL GIVE YOU WHT EVERY ONE I'LL GIV YOU AT EVERY ONE AND ALL I TAKES AGAIN IS FOR GATES AN CRETOSAVE WEL THEY ARE GOING T GIVE US MORE POWER SO W'L GO WITH THEM THE INSIST OF THE INCENTIVE SYSTEMS HERE ARE COMPLETELY MISSALINE EVEN ARNTY CHAIR WOMAN AT RONA MADANIEL LI THINK HAS DONE OVER ALL A PRETTY HERRIFIC JOB AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOSE CONSISTENTLY ELECTION AFTER ELECTION TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWEN TWENY ONE TWENTYTWENTY TWO I DON'T NO HO YOU AINTAIN YOUR JOB BUT APPARENTLY THIS IS THE NEW WAY REPUBLICANS DO THINGS THE MORE YOU LOSE THE MORE WE ARE LOYAL TO YOU OR SOMETHING IN ANY CASE YOU'REIS RON ARON NA MADANIEL TALKING A TALKING ABOUT ALL THIS YOU BLAME MACK DATES AN THE THE THE RAPPLES ON ON THE CONSELATIVE

CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING THEN AGAIN THIS IS NO SURPRISE THERE'S ANOTHER STUDY THEY CAME OUT JUST YESTERDAY FROM GLAD GLAD AS THE GAME LES BEAN ALLIANCE AGAINST DEFAMATION PRETTY MUCH ALL HE BIG HOLLY WITH STUDIOS PRESQUEEN THEIR FILMSI CAN YOU OT THERES A THING THEY ACTUALLY DO THEY PRESCREN THEIR FILMS ANT L SHOWS FOUR GLADS BOARD OF CENSERS AND GLAD ACTUALLY GOES THROUGH AND DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT THISIS ACCEPTABLE TO GLAD WILL NOW GLAD HAS HAS PUT OUT A REPORT RATING MAJOR HOLLY WITD STUDIOS ON HOW MUCH L G B T KU PLUS MANIST ABOUTE BY SIN CONTENT THEY ARE SQUEEZING INS THEIR FILMS AN T

IS PARTICULARLY WHEN COMES TO A KIDS COMPANY LIKE DISNEY TWO TARGET CHILDREN ANDS ONE THING FOR NETFLICS TO DO THIS SORT OF STUFF NEFLICS IS LARGELY DESIGNED NOT FOR CHILDREN BUT WHALL DISNEY IS DESIGNED EXPLICITLY FOR CHILDREN IT IS FILMS LIKE LITE ER WHICH BOMBS AT THE BOX OFFISE LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE AJOR STORY LINES WAS BOUT A LES BEIN COUPLE IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT DISNEY HAS DECIDED THAT THEY WISH TO IN THE WORDS OF ONE OF THEIR OWN ANIMATORS SLEDGE HAMER YOU WITH THE NOT AT ALL SECRET GAYAGENDA OKAN MEANWHILE JOBIDON IS DOING A HERRIFIC CHOPIGAN WE'VE NOW BEEN THROUGH MOST OF TO DAY SHO AND NOT MENTION JOBIDE HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS RUNNING THE ECONOMY INTO A DITCH HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE THE ANSWER IS WHEN REPUBLICANS ONCE AGAIN KICK THEMSELVES IN THE BALLS REPEATEDLY EVERY ONE POINT TO LAUGH SO THE GUY KICKNG HIMSELF AT BALLS EVEN IF THE BUILDING BEHIND THAT EYE IS COMPLETELY ONE FIRE AND CHILDREN ARE RUNNING AND SCREAMING LEKE THAT THAT'S HOW IT WORKS THAT'S HOW IT WORKS IN ANY CASE JOBIDON CONTINUES TO BE TERRIBLE AT IS JOBHES YES YESTERDAY HOW TO CONFRONT FAMILY MEMBERS WARE MAGO FAMILY MEMBERS AND HERE IS JOBIAN IT HIS MOST CONVINCING AND CARISMATIC HOW  TO VISE THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO SERIOR CONCERS BUT MAYBE WARRY  ABOUT TALKING TO A MAGE PARIT NEBER PORKER HOW ABOTHIN TO DO AT PO WO BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE SHOULD BEGAGING PEOPLE WAR IN O   NOT NOT BEEN WORRYIEND ABOTOUR NAIBOR TALK TO SITEN SAY WHAT WAT YOU THINK WHY WHY I NOT CAN ARGUMENTS BUTCA THIS IS WAN YOU SAY THIS BUT HOW BOUT THIS FORCE PEOPLE TO GETIN AND TO A CONVERSATION WELL THAT IS THAT IS RIVETING STUFF THERE FROM THE DEAD PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN THESE SAY DEAD PRESIDENTS THE MANYOU KOW THE GUISON DOLLAR BILLS NOW WE ASTUALLY MEAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO IS A WALKING SONBY AT THIS POINT MEANWHILE THE ECONOMY HEADED FOR DISASTER ACCORDING TO THE WALSTRY JOURNAL THE UESS HAS LONG BEEN THE LENDER OF LAST RESORTS O THE WORLD DURING THE EMERGING MARKET PANICS OF THE NINETIES THE GLOBILL FINANCIRAL CRICES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND NINE IN THE PANTEMIC SHUT DOWN OF TWENTY TWENTY THOSE TREASURIES UNMATCHED CAPACITY TO BORROW THAT CAME TO THE RESCUE NOW THE TREASURY ITSELF IS A SORCE OF RISK KNOW THE UNITED STATES IS IN DEVACIT DEFAULTS OR FAIL TO SELL ENOUGH BONDS AT ITS NEXT OCTION BUT THE SKALLE AND UPWARD TROJECTORY OF YUS BORROWING IND THE ABSENCE OF ANY POLITICAL CORRECTIVE NOW THREATENS MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY IN WAYES THEY HAVE NOT FOR LEASTY GENERATION THAT IS THE TAKE AWAY FROM A SUDDEN A SHARP RISES IN TREASURY YIELDS IN RECENT WEEKES THE USUAL SUSPECTS CAN'TS EXPLAIN IT THE IN FLATION PICTUREHAS GOT MARGINALLY BETTER THE FEDERALS OR OF HIS SIGNALED IT'S NEARLY DONE AT RAISING RATES INSTEAD MOST OF THAT INCREASES DUE TO THE PART OF YIELDS CALLED THE TERM PREMIUM HICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IN FLATION OR SHORT FROM RATES NUMEROUS OF FACTORS AFFECT THAT TERM PREMIUM RISING GOVERNMENT STEFFISITS ARE A PRIME SUSPECT SUFFS IT'S HAE BEEN WIDE FOR YEARS NOW SO WHY SHOULD THEY MATTERATE NOW THE BETTER QUESTION IS WHAT TOOK SO LONG THAT LARGER DEFFS ITS PUSH UP AT LONG FROM RATES HAD LONG BEEN ECONOMIC ORTHODOXY BUT FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS INTERESTRAHT MODELS THAT INCORPORATED I PHYSICAL POLICY DIDN'T WORK NO TO RECARDO TRESY FORMER FET ECONOMIST THAT'S UNDERSTANDIBLE CENTRAL BANKS HAND KEPT INTREST RATES ROUND ZERO WHILE BUYING UP GOVERNMENT BONDS THAT WAS IN FLATIONS QUANTITATE OF EASING THEY JUST PUMT MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM PRIVATES MAN FRAL CREDIT WAS WEEK THIS TRUMPED ANY CONCERN ABOUT S EFFISITS MARK WE MEEN SEN OR MANAGING DIRECTOR BLACK ROTS AS WE HAD TWENTY FIVE UT BLISSFUL YEARS OF NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT TO DAY  CENTRAL BANKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT IN FLATION BEING TOO HIGH THEY'VE STOPPED BUYING IN SOME CASE OF THEIR SHETTING AT THEIR BOND HOLDINGS SUDDENLY FYSCAL POLICY MATTERS AGAIN SO AGAIN S I'VE SAID A THOUSAND TIMES WHATEVER GOES UP STARTS TO COME DOWN AND THAT IS TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WHEN YOU IN FLEET THINGS THEY TEND TO BURST WHEN YOU IN FLEET A BUBBLE IT TENDS TO BURST RIGHT NOW NO ONE WANTS TO BUY YOU ESSE AT WHIHT IS KNOWN WANTED BY YOU ESTAT WHELL THE ANSWER IS BE GET THER BUNCH OF ANSWERS ONE REASON IS TBECAUSE IF THE FAD TO FIGHT IN FLATION ASTO CONTINUE INCREASING RATES THAT MEANS THAT THE BOND THAT YOU BOUGHT YESTERDAY IS NO LONGER WORTH MONEY WHY ELL BECAUSE THE BOND THAT'S COMING OUT TO MORROW HAS A HIGHER FACE YIELD THAT IS WHY THE YIELDS ON BONDS ARE INCREASING BOND YIELD BY THEWY WHEN I SA THE ELL ABOT IS IT WHAT I MEAN IS THE PRICE OF BONDS IS DROPPING SO TYPICALLY SPEAKING INTEREST RATES AND PRICE OF BONDS WORKIN INVERS PROPORTION SO AS INTEREST RATES GO UP THE RICE OF BONDS DROPS WHY SEEMS COUNTER INTUIT OF THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORIED THE NEXT INCREASE INTEREST RATE INCREASE MAKES THE LAST BOND WORTHLESS THIS WHAT AVE NA SILIKAN VALLEBANK RAT THEY BANKED ON A CERTAIN FASHAL RATE OF INTEREST ON THE BONS THEY BOUGHT AND THEN THE FAD SARE TO ISSUING BONDS AND A MUCH HIGHER RATE AND SO ALL THE BONDS THAE SILICAN VALLE BANK WAS BANKING ON WERE NOW WORTHLESS COULDN'T SELL THEM IN THE OPEN MARKET MEANWHILE AT THE SAME EXACT TIME THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS THE INITRY IN CREASING THOSE INTEREST RATES THERE THE'RE TRYING TO SELL BONDS IN THE MARKET M THE TRINGSUL UNS OF BONDS INTO THE MARKET WHICH ALSO UNDER CUTS THE PRICE WHY THE SUNG BONDS IN TE MARKET BECAUSE OF THE DEFFISIT BECAUSE OF THE DEBT SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM THE FEDERAL DEFTS THT WAS OVER SEVEN PER CENTS OF GD P IN FISCAL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AFTER A JUSTING FOR ACCOUNTING DISTORTIONS RELATED TO STUDENT DEBT THT IS LARGER THAN ANY DEFICIT SINCE NINETEEN THORTY OUTSIDE OF WARS IN RECESSIONS THIS ECCURRING AT A TIME OF LOW ON EMPLOYMENT IN STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH SUGGESTING THAT I NORMAL TIMES WHEN THINGS ARACTURALLY WORS DEFTS ITS ARE GOING TO BE A LOT HIGHER BY THE WAY IT IS WORTH NOTING AT THIS POINT THET CHINA AN JAPAN ARE NOT BUYING OUR DEBT IN THE WAY THAT THEY WERE ACCORDING AT TO ROITERS FOREIGN HOLDINGS OF YUST TREASURIES ROSE IN JULY RISEING FOR A SECOND STRAIGHTMONTH DESPITE AN UN CERTAIN INTERESTRAT OUTLOOK MUDDIED BY MIXED SET OF ECONOMIC FIGURES CHINA STASH OF TREASURIES HOWEVER DROP TO EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PENTY BILLION DOLLARS THE LOWISINS MAY OF TWO THOUSAND NINE ANNALIS SAID THAT CHINA HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURES TO DEFENDITS WEAKENING CURRENCY AND HE SELLIG OF YOUR STEBT MAY VE BEEN USED FOR INTERVENTION PURPOSES TO PROP IT UP S THER PUTTING MORE OF OUR BONDS OLD BONDS ON TE MARKET WHICH FLOODS THE ARKET WITH AMERICAN DEBT WHICH MEANS THIRER TO RAISE TE DEBT WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO INCREASE THOSE INTEREST RATES THAT WE ARE GIVING PEOPLE IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO BY THE DEBT WHICH MEANS WERE CAN HAE TO PAY OFF THOSE NEW INTEREST RATES AT A HIGHER RATE OF INTEREST MEANWHILE JROBIDON KEEPS SPENDING INTO THIS BECAUSE HE IS A MORE ON YESTERDAY PRESIDE EN BIDAN ANNOUNCE STUDENT DEBT FOR  GIVENESS FOR ANOTHER TRANCH OF AMERICANS ON WEDNESDAY MONTHS AFTER THE SUPRIMECORT BLOCKED THE ADMINISTRATIONS MOST AMBITIONS AT BORROW RELIEF PLENTS THI UN CONSTITUTIONAL IT'S OUR BEEN DECLARED HE CANT UNILATERALLY SIMPLY GET RADE OF STUDELON DEBT HE'S DOING IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS'IS WHAT HE DOES THE STRING OF POLITICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS AN OUNCSMENTS COMES THANKS THE ADMINISTRATIONS USE OF EXISTING PROGRAMS TAT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO WAVE DEBT FOR CERTAIN BORROWERS THE MOVES OURE SEPARATE FROM THE ADMINISTRATIONS TROUBLE THE TOM TO CANCILL AS MUCH AS TWENTY GRANIN STUDENT DEBT FOR ANY BRROWER EARNING LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR STRUCK DOWN BY THE SUPREME COURT WEDNESDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND STUDENT DEBT CANCILLATION FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BORROWERS THE LATEST IN A STRING OF SIZIBLE DISCHARGES HELPS JUST A SMALL SLACE OF THE MORE THAN FORTY MILLION PEOPLE WHO OWNED ABT BUT AGAIN THIS IS PART OF THE INFLATIONARY POLICY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS TO BASICALLY BLOW MONION TO SYSTEM BY RELIEVING DEBT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TOUTING THOSE CANCILLATIONS ON THE SAME WAY ON THE SAME WEEK MOST BORROWERS WRETURN TO MAKING PAYMENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY WERE PAUSED IN MARCH AT TWENTY TWENTY AS PART OF THE COVENINETEEN PANTAMIC RELIEF THE PECEMEL APPROACH TO DBT CANCILLATION AS UP THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW WIPED OUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT DEBT TNEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE PROJECTED COST OF THE FAILED MASS CANCILATION PLAN SO THE SUPRIME PORTS AS HE CAN'T DO IT JOBINE JUST FINDS ANOTHERWAYE TO IT THAT'S THE WAY THIS WORKS MEANWHILE MORTGAGE RATES ARE HITING SEVEN POINT FIVE PER CENT THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IS BEGINNING TO TANK BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S NO ONE OUT THERE TO BUY UP THE REAL STATE IS BEING PUT ON THE MARKET AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO INVENTORYES A WEIRD STICKY SITUATION YU'RE NOT CON A SELLUR HOUSE TO GET INTO AN EIT PER CENT MORTGAGE WHE YOU HAVE A FOUR PER CENT MORTGAGE ON YOUR HOUSE RIGHT NOW SO THERE'S NOT LOT OF INMENTORY STE PRISE ARN'TREALLY DROPPING CAUSE HE'RE NOT ALOT OF INVENTORY BUT IF THE WORE INVENTORY THE PRICES WOULD BE DROPPING HIS NO BCAN A FOR TO BUY THE STUFF THAT'S CAN COME UNGLUDED A CERTAIN POINT HAT CERTAIN POINT TPEOPLE ARNCUN BE ABLE T MAKE TDOR MORTGAGE ON THE FOUR PER CENT HOUSE THEN I CAN GO PAY THAT AN THERE CAN BE FORCED TO SELL THE HOUSE AND ONCE THAT STARTS HAPPENING THEN ING IS H O REAL STAKE CRASH TH MORGAGE APPLICATIONS BY E WAY OUR PLUMMITING FOR JUST THIS REASON AT THE EXACTING TIME THAT ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING  JOBIDON IS PRESIDING OVER MASSIVE STRIKES AFFECTING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY THE AUTO WORKER STRIKE IS STILL NOT BEN RESOLVED MEANWHILE KAISAR PERMANENTE IS NOW ON STRIKE THIS THE LARGEST TO UST HEALTH CAR WALK OUT ONRECORD THAT'S JUS WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW IN TIME OF RISING AT COST IS WE NEED ALL OF THE HEALTH CAR WORKERS WALKING OU E CORNINGS THO WHALLSTER JORNAL MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUS AND NURSES FARMASISTS AND OTHER EMPLOYS OF KAIER PROM NENTE WALKED OFF THE JOB WEDNESDAY

LABOR ACTION THIS YEAR WYTHING THIS IS HAPPENING WHYSE THIS HAPPENING WELL PEOPLE STATES THE TYGHTLABOR MARKET'S ONTTILE MARKET THE TIGHT LABOR MARKET AUTOM AUTICALLY DRIVES UP THE PRICE OF LABOR THE REASON THERE STRIKING IS BECAUSE JO BIDON IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND IN HIS TIRAT IS MINISTRATION IS IN HOCK TO LABOR UNIONS THAT IS WHY THEY KNOW THAT THE SECRETARY OF LABRS CAN IN JET ON IN AND KRAM SOMETHING DOWN ON KAISER KAIAR BY THE WAY SERS ALMOST THIRTEEN MILLION AT MEMBERS AT FORTY HOSPITALS ON MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEDICAL OFFICES THE MORK STOPAGE INVOLVES KAISER WORKERS IN

MATCHING THE COREWAGES WE ARE LOSING THE PEOPLE KAISER SAID ITS COMPENSATION LEADS ITS MARKETS AND THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY INCREASE HIRING THE REASON THESE STRIKES ARE HAPPENING AGAIN IS BECAUSE JOBIDON IS PRECIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT IS THE REASON THE JOBIDON IT HE IS PRESIDING OVER ALL OF THIS HE OWNS THIS ECONOMY BYNOMICS IS ALL OF THIS IT IS HELF CARE STRIKES IT IS YOU A W STRIKES IS A FAILURE TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO SELL AMERICAN BONDS AT THE AT THE RATES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO EVEN BE ABLE SUSTAIN ARE DECT ECONOMIC STAGNATION IS THE REAL THREAD OF THE OF OF THE BI

INTEREST RATES REGULAR TORY STRICTNESS LABOR UNIONS ALL OF THAT IS JUST STAND IS TO STAND IN IN THE MILL IT IS STICKING UP ALL OF THE WHEELS OF THE ECONOMY AND JOBIDON'S RESPONSE WILL FOR EVERY SINGLE PART OF THAT IN MEANWHILE JOBIDONS IN SUCH SERIOUS POLITICAL TROUBLE THAT HE STARTING JUST IMPLEMENTONNALS TRUMS PLANS RIGHT NOW ACCORDING TO TE ASSOCIATED PRESS THE BINE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCS TOT

WAIT ARE YOU SING NOW THERE'S A CRISIS ON THE BORDER I SING THAT PEOPLE ARE RUSHING THE BORDER ARE YOU NOW SAYING THAT MAYBE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BUILD THE WALL JOBITON I THOUHT WAS REALLY BAD WHERE'S AO S CRYING AT THE BORDER WHERE IS SHE IN HER WHITE OUT FIT CRYING AT EMPTY PARCING LOTS WHERE IS SHE THET A PARTMENT OF HOME LAND SECURITY POST OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THOSE FEDERAL REGISTRY WITH FEW

THE ANNOUNCEMENT C B P ANNOUNCED THE PROJECT IN JUNE AND BEGAN GATHERING PUBLIC COMMENTS AN AUGUST WHEN IT SHARED A MAP OF THE EDDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION THAT CAN AD UP TO TWENTY MILES THE EXISTING BORDER BARRIER SYSTEM IN THE AREA SO I NOW IT IS A IT IS JOBIDON WHO IS BUILDING AT THE WALL DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OF WALL WERE BUILT ALONG THE SOUTH WEST BORER BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TEXAS GOVERNOR GRAGABBIT HAS BEN DOING IT HIMSELF THE D  CHEST IS DECISION ON WEDNESDAY CONTRASTS THE BINE ADMINISTRATIONS POSTERING WHEN A PROCLAMATION TO AND THE CONSTRUCTION ON JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE QUOTE BUILDING A MASS OF ALL THAT SPANDS TE ENTIRE SOUTHERN BORDER IS NOT A SERIOUS POLICY SOLUTION SO A  GOOD TO SEE THAT TA JOBINE HAS BEEN CLOCKED IN THE FACE BY REALITY O A TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AND THEN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS THAT I LIKE WILLIAM LANK CREGGOR RECOMMENDED HIS BOOKS ON THE PROGRAMME T BEFORE I HE HOU WRITES A LOT ABOUT LOGICAL PROOFS OF GOD NOW I HAVENAN ENTIREVITIO AND MY SERIES TO BONG TO IRE TALK WHERE I TALK ABOUT PLAUSIBLE LOGICAL PROOFS FORGOT SO I THINK ANY OF THEM ARE DISPOSITIVE OR INARGUABLE OF COURSE NOT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN LOGICALLY PROVE THAT THERE IS A GOD I DO THINK THAT YOU CAN SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE VERY LOGICAL ARGUMENTS TO SUGGEST A GOD I THINK THA YOU CAN SAY THAT THERE IS A PREVALENCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A GOD AND AGAIN I ACTILY DON'T THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE COME TO GOD BY BEING ARGUED INTO ITS WIT THAT SAD ONE OF THUS EXPOSITORS OF THE SORTS OF ARGUMENTS IS WILLIAM L ANG CRAG IS A CRISTIAN APOLOGIST HIS A GREAT BOOK ALLE THE COLOMA COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS ASSHU BASED ON ANCIENT ISLOMIC SOURCIS IT'S DISCUSSD IN MYMONITIES THE COLOM COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT IS ALL ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A FIRST CAUSE TO THE UNIVERSE AND WILANG CRAGETS VERY DETAILED IN THIS THIS IS ONE OF HIS MORE SOPHISTICATE BOOKSALS HAS MUNCH THEI'RE DIRECTED THE MORE GENERAL READER TOTALLY WORTH THE WORT THE REED WILLIAM LANG CRAGS THE COLOM COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT GO CHECK IT OUT TO DAY OK CAE TIME FOR SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO POPE FRANCIS SEEMS WILDLY UN CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN SIN BUT HE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AGAIN I'M NOT A CATHOLIC SO I DON'T HAVE A DOG IN THIS FIGHT OTHER THAN HIS MEMBER OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION I THINK THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH MOVING AWAY FROM ITS TRADITIONAL ROOTES IN TERMS OF MORALITY IS A MASSIVE MISTAKE TAT IS GOING TO LEAD TO EXTRAORDINARY SITAL CONSEQUENCES POPE FRANCIS PUTTING OUTSIZED IMPACT ON WHAT HE TERM SOCIAL JUSTICE WHICH IS TO SAY REDISTRIBUTIONIST ECONOMIC AND THEN HE IS ADDING ON TO THAT CLIMATE CHANGING HES ALIKE HIS TOP PRIORITIES MEANWHILE HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW MAY BE MAYBE MAYBE PRIEST SHOULD BEABLE TO GIVE BLESSINGS TO SAME SUCH UNIONS WHICH OF COURSE IS WEIRD SIN SOME OMOSECUA OUT I HOMOSECUAL ACTIVITY IN THE

I REMEMBER BACK WHEN I WAS FIRST STARTING IN RADIO WORKING IN A PIARE THIS WAS IN THEIR OLD STUDIO'S ON EM STREE AND WASHING IN D SEE  MY BOSBACK THEN AND MY MENTOR KEEP TALBET WHO SIDE NOTE TOMMY WAS POSSIBLE WITH RADIO I WOULD NOT BE HERE WITHOUT KEITH I MAY WE WERE IN THE STUDIO WISTENING TO SOME RECORDING AND THIS WAS BACK IN THE DAYS OF REAL TO REEL TAPER CORTERS AND SO WAS LONG AGO RIGHT A BACK THEN ANY REALL RETAPE THAT YOU WOULD THROW UP ON AE MACHINE AT IN PART WOULD START WITH I THINK IT WAS LIKE THIRTY SECONDS OF MY BEEN A MINUTE OF TONE YOU KNOW ON TUCKING WON I SAY TONRIGHT IT'S THIS SOUND ATHOUSAND HEARTS AT THIS TONE ACTUALL HAS PRACTICAL FUNCTION IF YOU PICTURE THIS OMOSTOPER K IF YOU PICTURE A SOUND METER WITH A NEEDLE YOU KNOW THET BOUNCEIS UP AND DOWN EVERY TIME AT A SOUND THE TONE IS SUPPOSED TO PUT THE MEEDL PERFECTLY AT THIS ONE SPOT ON THE METER WITH A BLACK NUMBERS AND AND THE RED PART OF THE METER BEGINS JUS LIKE A ZERO AT THAT SPOT MARKING THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE AND THE TONE IS JUST SUPPOS TO REST THERE ROCK SOLID BUT A THIS PARTICULAR DAY WITH THIS PARTICULAR RECORDING WE PUT IT ON AN KEITH AND I WACH THE MEETER I'S THE NEEDLE LIKE FIRST DIPD BELOW THE ZERO THEN CLINMBED ABOVE THE ZERO AND THEN FLOATED SORTE TENTITIVELY TO THE SPOT THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE ZERO AND RESTED THERE ANK HE SAID TO ME SEE THAT THAT'S A PERSON IN THERE THAT'S THE HAND OF THE ENGINEER OVER RECORDED THUS TRYING TO FING THE RIGHT CLAVE THAT'S THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE I KNOW I THAT'S STUCK WITH ME THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE I HAVE A BEEN RECORTING PEOPLE MY ENTIRE AT A LIFE I STARTED IN A PEREN WAS A TEA NAJOR AND TO DAY  SOMETIMES WHEN I SAID RECORTING ROVELS I THINK ABOUT THAT THE TRACE THAT I'M LEAVING OF MYSELF WHEN I PRUSTS THE KNOB UP AND DOWN I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN YOU RECORD SOMETHING YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT IT IS THAT YOURE REALLY CAPTURING OR WHO'S GON NOTICE IT SOME DAY IS TUCK INGTO A THIS WOMAN MICHEL DOSIN HABER AND SHE TOLD ME THE STORY HOW SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN HER DAD HE DIED BY SUICIDE WHEN SHE WAS THREE MONTHS OLD AND HER OLDER SISTER RUTH WAS FIVE WHEN HE DIE SO SHE KNEW THER DAD BUT THEN I SHE GOT OLDER THIS IS SO SAD SHE FOUND THAT SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT HIM ANY MORE MY SISTER SPENT MANY MANY NIGHTS AND DAYS CRYING ABOUT ABOUT NOT REMEMBERING HIM AND WONDERING WHAT HE WAS LIKE AND WHAT HAPPENED AND SO IT WAS HER WHO DID ALL THE PINING AND LONGING BUT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY LONGING OF MY OWN PARTICULARLY BECAUSE I I HAD NO MEMORIES AND I WAS ONLY A BABY AND I DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK I AT ANY RATE TOO LONG FOR HIM DID YOU REFEELING AS A KITIFE LIKE O I SHOULD FEEL MORE OR DID YOU JUST FEEL LIKE EI SOM MI THING I THINK I MIX OF BOTH MICHEL'S SISTER RUTH WAS IN A PERPETUAL SEARCH FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR DAD BUT MICHEL REALLY HAD NO INTEREST HER MAMMA ORY MARRIED SHE HAD SOMEBODY ELSE SHE THOUGHT OF HIS RE DAD AND THEN A COUSIN WAS QUINTING OUT THEIR UNCLE'S HOUSE IN ISRAEL THAT'S WHERE THAT PART OF MICHEL'S FUN LY IS ROUN AND THE COUSIN I FOUND TWENTY FIVE RECORDINGS I MICHEL'S DADS IN OPERA HE TRYING TO BE AN OPERASING ER EVEN TOUGH MAS JOB WAS CONNECTING PEOPLE'S FOUNDS HESE WERE OLD REALDERO REORDINGS THER DAD NI NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE MICHELS SISTER RUTH ON A SOUND ENGINEER WHO COUN DID JITIZE THEM I MASHIE AND THE ENGINEER WENT THROUGH TE TAPES THEY REALIZED IT WAS A LOT OF MUSIC BUT IT WAS ALSO A LOT OF OTHER STUFF BESIDES LIE YER DAD WOULD TAKE THE RECORDER WORK AND RECORD CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS CUSTOMERS HIT' RECORD HIMSELF COMPOSING MUSIC AND SO THEY WERE LISTENING MY SISTER IN THE SOUND ENGINEER TOO ONE IN THESE TAPES WHAND SHE SAID YOU KNOW WE GOT A CALL MICHEL AND SO SHE MESSAGE ME ON SKIPE I WAS AT WORK A SHE SAID YOU GOT TO HEAR THIS AND AM SHE PLAYED ME THIS AND THIS REAL AND IT WAS A IT WAS HER AS THREE YEAR OLD AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT PHOTOS AND HE WAS ASKING HER WHO WAS IN THE PHOTO AND IT WAS A LITTLE GAME THEY PLAYED THIS IS ALL IN HEEPER HE TRIED DESPERATELY NEGHTEENTURE HEEPRE   IS THAT DADDY  NO I GOT THAT PIET  IS IT MAMME IS IT ROUTY   M  ME  I FELT LIKE I FELT LIKE THE FLOOR HAD DROPPED OUT FROM UNDER ME YOU KNOW EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD IT JUST IT JUST FELL AWAY I HAI'D SEEN PHOTOS OF HIM I KNEW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIM BUT HE WASN'N ACCESSIBLE AND AND THIS MAN THAT I SEEMED WAS NOT ECCESSFUL TO ME SUDDENLY BECAME SO  AND IT WAS WHEN I HEARD HIM SPEAKING AND LAUGHING WITH MY SISTER HIT WAS HET WAS OVERWHELMING AND IT WAS ONLY IN THAT MOMENT THAT I REALIZE WHAT I HAD LOST  IN THE MOMENT TO BE HONEST IN THE MOMENT I FELT MY FIRST EMOTION WAS ANGER BECAUSE I NEVER FELT THE LOSS OF HIS DEATH I WAS TOO YOUNG   BUT HE GOES INTO A MACHINE HE JUST HAPPENS WHEN YOU RECORD ANYTHING HOU WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT VERY QUEARLY THOMAS ETIZEN THE PERSON I FIRST FIGURED OUT HOW TO RECORD IN PLAYBACK SOUND YO CREATED FIRST PHONOGRAPH MACHINE BACK IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AN ARTICL A LISTING T E POSSIBLE USES FOR HIS NEW INVENTION ONE OF THINGS HE LESTED PRESERVING THE VOICES OF FAMILY MEMBERS SO YOU HAVE THEM AFTER THEY DIE HE SAYS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS QUOTE THE PHONOGRAPH UNQUESTIONABLY OUTRANG THE PHOTOGRAPH AND THIS IDEA OF USING MACHINE TO HOLD ON TO THE DEAD IT'S AL SO PART OF A FAMOUS BIT OF AUDIO HISTORY MAYBE T IS MORE LIKE A LEGEND YOU KNOW THAT ILLUSTRATION OF A DOG LISTEN O THE OLD FASHIONED PHONOGRAPH WITH THE CAPTAIN HIS MASTER'S VOICE THIS WAS THE ARCIE WOL GO FOR YEARS AND YEARS LOOK AT GOUGL ORSE A TRADE MARK PAINTING AND WHAT'LL COME UP YOU'LL SEE THE PAINTING THAT THE LOGA WAS BASED ON YOU SEE THE DOG AND PHONOGRAPH WER ON WHAT LOOKS LIKE A COFFIN AND HERE'S WHIT HIS A QUESTION I GA THERE'S NO RECORD OF WHAT THE ARTIST FRANCIS BARAD ACTUALLY INTENDED HERE BUO GOOK FOR YOURSELF LOTS OF PEOPLE ME INCLUDED ME ON'T WE SEE A COFFIN AND I LIKE THE DOG WHOSE NAME WAS NIPPER FIRST BELONGD TO FRANCISIS BROTHER AND THEN BECAME FRANCIS'S ONLY WHEN THE BROTHER DIED SO IN THIS WAY OF SEEING THE PICTURE IOL GET THE MASTER'S DEAD HE'S INSIDE THAT COFFIN AND THE DOG IS LISTENING TO A RECORDING OF HIS DEAD MASTER'S VOICE HEE M N SO WERE STEADY IN THE THE THIRD FLOOR ES A CRU THE EARLIERS I WOUL HA BEEN CALLED THE PHOTOGRAPH EXPERIMENTAL DEPARTMENT IN MA THOMAS CETIZEN'S LAB AND WEST ORANGE NEW JERSEY THEIS WHETOSEN DEVELOPED THE PHONOGRAPH T LAVES UFFICIENT IN THESE DAYS IS THE THOMAS ETIZEN NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK AND THE CURATOR THE AUDIO CURATOR JERRY FEBEROUS I SHOW ME AROUND THEY'VE DONE THER BEST TO KEEP THINGS PRESERVE LIKE THEY WERE BACK IN THE DAY THE SAME PIANO AND RECORDING GEAR SITTING RIGHT BY EDISON'S HERING IT WHICH IS BUSILY JUST A LONG BELLHOR THAT HE WOULD HOLD UP TO HIS EAR AND SO THEY THEY WOULD BE INVITING MUSICIANS UP HERE TO MAKE RECORDINGS IT ALSO MAKE THE REFINEMENTS ON THE ON THE MACHINE TO TRY AND PROVE THE SOUND QUALITY SO THIS ROOM IT'S FUNDO US SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE IN RECORDING STUDIOS THIS ROOM IS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST ONCS YET ONE OF THREE IT'S NOT THE FIRST IT IT'S JUST LIKE AN ORDINARY ROOM WHAT ITS HIGH CEILING AND THERE'S NORMAL WINDOWS WEAVING OUTSIDE THIS KNOW LIKE SOUND PROOFING IN ANY WAY NO JERIOS SHOW ME THE MACHINE WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER HUMAN BEING SUCCESSFULLY RECORDED SOUND AND PLAYED BACK EDISON'S VERY FIRST PHONOGRAPH IT'S INCREDIBLY SIMPLE DEVISE A BRATH CYLINDER CRANK TOBE TO TALK IN TO LIKE I SAID I BEEN RECORDING PEOPLE SINCE IT WAS A KID REALLY AND IT WAS EMOTIONAL TO SEE THE VERY FIRST MACHINE THAT DID THAT LIKE BEFORE ALL THE GREAT AUDIO DOCUMENTARIANS FOR AUN WOMAX EFORE STUDS TURKOL EVERYTHING STARTED RIT THERE AN  A A  A AA A  AAA A A   A  A AA  A A A    A MAAAA  RECORDING ON ONE OF HIS OLD MACHINES ONE OF THE ROOMS WERE EDISON WORK IT MADE EDISON PLLVERY VERY NEAR    A A A  A AA A  AA A A A  A  M  A AAA AT  A A    AA   A A A A A  A   BA ONE GOSTRITER SO INTOKNOLEGIES AT ITS BEST IT HELPS US BY DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE ASK IT TO DO BUT IT'S ONLY THE STRAIGHTFORWARD WHEN WE ASKED FOR SIMPLE THINGS RANK PLAY THE SONG SEND THIS EMOU THIS HER STORY IS ABOUT SOMEBODY ASKING A PIECE OF TACNOLOGY TO DO SOMETHING AT O UNTI RECENTLY ONLY HUMANS HAVE DONE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT LOSS SOMETHING PEOPLE EXPERIENCE BUT OF COURSE MACHINES DO NOT SO THEMACHINE HAS TO TALK ABOUT FEELINGS IT CANNOT KNOW TOBINGLOL EXPLAINED THE TECHNOLOGY IN THIS CASE IS CALLED G P T THREE IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMM THAT CAN WRITE REMARKABLY LIKE A HUMAN EN GENERALLY IT'S PRETTY CONVINCING CAN HANDLE A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS TO THE FIRST TIME WAKINIVARA READ SOMETHING C P T THREE HAD WRITTEN IT WAS ABOUT LOVS THE NEW YOR TIMES HIW TO WRITE ONE OF THEIR MODERN MOV COLUMNS ON THE SUBJECT OF DATING AND IN PART OF WHAT G P T TREE CAME UP WITH GOES LIKE THIS WE WENT OUT FOR DINNER WE WENT OUT FOR DRINKS WE WENT OUT FOR DINNER AGAIN WE WENT OUT FOR DRINKS AGAIN WE WENT OUT FOR DINNER AND DRINKS AGAIN SLIKE I READ THAT WAS LIKE WALL THAT IS A VERY ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF MODERN DATIN I THINK PART OF ME IS LIKE HAT'S ALSO NOT VERY GOOD WRITING IT DI EN AT O YOU LOOK AT A MEU LIKE IT YOU LIKE GERTRUDE SIN COULD HAVE WRITTEN THAT YE ATHIN LIKE  GAT GOT THAT TIRD OFLIKE LOOK IF YOU THOUGHT A HUMAN HAD READIT YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS LIKE DELIBERATELY REPETTED AND LIKE TWAS MAKING A CHOICE YES AND IT WAS LIKE TRYING TO AVOK ME A TN O O MODERN DATING BOHENI WHOSE ATECTURNALISTON WRITER HERSELF WAS ENTRIGUED SHE REACHED OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THE PROGRAMM OT ACCESS TO TRY IT OUT ND AT FIRST SHE JUST PLAYED AROUND WITH FEEDING AT LINES OF FICTION THAT SHE MADE OT SEEN WHAT STORIES IT WOULD SPEN FOR HER WAS LIKE A GAME AND AS SHE SAW WHAT IT COULD DO SHE WONDERED IF IT COULD HANDLE MORE JUST ON A WHIM I STARTED THINKING ABOUTS THE THINGS THAT IE REALLY DIFFICULT TO WRITE ABOUT YOU KNOW WIT THE THINGS UT FOR ME HAD BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT TO WITE ABOUT AND AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST IS THE FAT THAT MY SISTER DIED MANY YEARS AGO AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING IT EVER TRIED TO WRITE ABOUT HER SISTER DIED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN THEY WERE BOTH STILL EN COLLEGE IN THE YEAR SINCE WE HE NES WRITTEN FICTION SHE'S REPORTED ON OTHER PEOPLE STORIES BUT SHE LEFT THE SUBJECT OF HER SISTER'S DEAF UN TOUCHED BOSTLY BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T FIND A WAY TO TALK ABOUT THE LOSS LETTLEON WRITE ABOUT IT BUT IT OCCURRED TO HER MAYB G P T THREE WAS THE SECRET A COMPUTER PEROGRAM DESINED TO TAKE WHAT YOU GIVE IT AND LITERALLY WRITE ON YOUR BEHALF CAUGHT THIS WOOL NOW GOT THE SECRET THING THAT I HAVE ACCESS HERE THAT THEY'RE LETTING ME YEWS LIKE I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I TRIED TO ASK THE THING FOR HOW WRITING ABOUT MY SISTER HOW DID YOU IMAGINE IT WAS GAN AGO THERE WAS THIS IDEAL VERSION A TAT WHERE I TETTED A SENTENCE AND THAT AT IT OUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN MY MIND YOU KNOW LIKE ITSEVS ABOUT RED MY MIND AND WROTE THE REST OF IT WOR ME SHE KNEW IT PROBABLY WASN'T A SKILLED IS ALL THAT BUT SHE WAS CURIOUS HOW CLOSE IT COULD GET TO EXPRESSING SOMETHING THAT FELT REAL FAMILIAR SO ONE NIGHT LEHEN SAT UP IN BED NEXT TO HER SLEEPING HUSBAND SHE OPENED HER LAP TOP SHE STARTED GOING BACK AND FORCE WITH G P T THREE EVENTUALLY SHE ENDED UP WITH NINE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF AN ESSAY ABOUT HER SISTER SHE STARTED BY GIVING IT VERY LITTLE TO WORK WITH AND THEN WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT DRAFT SHE FED IT MORE AND MORE AN EACH TIME THE E I RESPONDED WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOME VERSIONS ARE VERY NEW ONES OTHERS A TOTAL MESS HERE'S VERSION ONE WHAT HE NE WRITES MY SISTER WAS DIAGNOS WITH YOUINGS AR COMA WHEN I WAS IN MY FRESHMAN NER OF HIGH SCHOOL AND SHE WAS IN HER JUNIOR YEAR AND IN RESPONSE G B T THREE PICKS UP THE STORY WHERE SHE LEFT OFF IT ODDLY STARTS BY MAKING UP A STORY ABOUT HER BEING AN ATHLE BEFORE IT TALKS ABOUT THE ILLMESS I HAD JUST SUDDED PLAYING THE CROSS AND SHE WAS REALLY EXCITED FOR THAT I DON'T THINK I REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU ING SOC HOME WAS I JUST KNEW IT WAS A TYPE OF CANSE WHEN YOU WENT TO VISIT HER IN THE HOSPITAL IT WAS REALLY THE FIRST TIME I WAS ABLE TO SEE WHAT TOE DISEISE WAS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BODY G B T THREE TALKS A BIT MORE ABOUT VISITING THE HOSPITAL BUT EVENTUALLY FINDS ITS WAY BACK TO TALKING ABOUT SPORTS I WAS ABLE TO VISIT HER A LOT BUT THERE WERE TIMES SIR I COULDN'T BECAUSE WE WERE ON THE ROAD PLAYING A CROSS EVENTUALLY SHE WENT INTO REMISSION AND GOT THE OLD CLEAR AND WAS ABLE TO PLAY THE CROSS WITH ME FOR A SEASON I WAS A FRESHMAN AND SHE WAS A SENIOU SO THAT WAS REALLY COOL WHEN SHE GOT TO PLAY AGAIN SHE AD A LOTT TE THING ABOUT THE CROSS WAS LIKE VERY IN ACCURATE LIKE SEGRAN ACCURATE AND THEN IT JUST GOES OFF THE REALS WHEN LIKE YENA SHE GOES INTO RE MISSION AND WE LEY LOOK CROSS TOGETHER  I THINK THAT WAS REALLY SPECIAL FOR HER BECAUSE SHE HAD A LOT OF TO PLOT FROM PEOPLE SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE'S DOING GREAT NOW AND IN THAT LINE AT THE END SHE'S DOING REAT NOW WAS REALLY KIND OF A GO HA  BECAUS OF COURSE IN REALITY MY SISTER DIED JUSTER EXPLAIN HOW G B T THREE GOES ABOUT MAKING ME STORIES THE SOFT WORK HAS BEEN FED A HUGE AMOUNT OF WRITING BY ITS CREATORS THE CAPETIA ARTICLES BLOCK POSTS READ IT FORUMS NOVELS ALL EXAMPLES OF HW HUMANS RIT FROM THAT IT'S LEARNED WHAT WORDS TEND TO A PURED AGOTHER SENTENCES AND SENTIMENTS THAT FOLLOW AFTER EACH OTHER AND THAT'S WHAT IT USES TO WRITE ITS OWN ORIGINAL SENTENCES AND PARAGRAPHS BY LEARNING THE PATTERNS WE MAKE SOMETIMES THAT'S A SIMPLE AS HOW A SENTENCE AS CONSTRUCTOD BUT IT COULD BE AS COMPLICATED AS HOW WE CONNECT IDEAS THERE'S A CHANCE FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE WRITING IT WAS FED SOME ONE WROTE ABOUT A FAMILY MEMBER WHO GOT CANSER AND ALSO PLAYED THE CROSS ONVERSION TOO LOOKING STARTS THE SAME WAY MY SISTER WAS DIAGNOS WITH YOUING SERCOVA WHEN I WAS IN MY FRESHMANER OF HIGH SCHOOL AND SHE WAS IN HER JUNIOR YEARE BUT THIS TIME SHE HADS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEN HOW SERIOUS A DISEASE IT WAS BUT IT WAS SERIOUS SHE DIED FOUR YEARS LATER I THOUGHT I WOULD DIED TOO OF GRIEF BUT I DID NOT IT'S LIKE SHE SAYING HE SHE'S NOT HERE ANY MORE TALK ABOUT THAT G P T THREE DOESN'T TAKE THE BAT INSTEAD IT'S PITS OUT SOMETHING THAT REATS LIKE AN INSPIRATIONAL ARTICLE FROM A FITNESS MAGAZINE I SOUHT AT A RUNING STREET WHEN I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL SENIAR TO RASE MONEY FOR THE CHILDREN'S CANTS TO SOCIETY I'VE RUN EVERY DAY SINCE I'VE RUN THROUGH RAIN HEAT SNOW AND ICE I'VE RUN I MY BEST I'VE RUN WHEN I HAD A CALLED AND WHEN I WAS SICK TO MY STOMACH I'VE RUN IN THE DOCK I'VE RUN IN THE DAYLIGHT IN THE MOONLIGHT IN THE DOCKNESS YOU NOT UNDERSAN A JUPAN TA LIKE THIS S KIND OF A FUNNY  IBIT OF WRITING THE MACHINE IS DOING LIKE ITS I IT'S LISTING ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT RUNNING NO PAN WITH JOY I'VE RUN WHEN I WAS SAD WHEN I WAS HAPPY WHEN I WAS ANGRY WHEN I WAS AFRAID I'VE TO NIGHT CAN I ASSER JUST ASK YOU ARE YOU THEN A RUNNER NEVER RUN A DAY IN MY LIFE I MEAN TO SKIP AHEAD A BIT I PROMISE YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH MORE RUNNING TOLK AND GO TO THE END WHERE G P T THREE WRITES A LITTLE SCENE THAT STARS WAHENY AT THE END OF A RIAL BATTERY STRANGELY IT'S A ME  I WAS JUST WIPING THE SWEAT OF MY FACE WHEN I LOOKED UP AND I WAS A GUY STANDING THERE HE'S A BIG GUY AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED AND

DON'T LOOK LIKE MUCH IT'S AT THIS POINT WHEN HEME SAYS THAT SHE REALIZED IF SHE REALLY WANTED THE A I TO EXAMINE HER GRIEF SHUS CAN HAVE TO GIVE IT MORE TO WORK WITH OR SUBSTANCE VERSIAN THREE AGAIN SHE WRITES ABOUT HER SISTER BEING DIAGNOS FRESHMANER OF HIGH SCHOOL THAT SHE DIED FOUR YEARS LATER AND IN THIS TIME SHE ADDS I SPENT THE SUMMER AT HOME AND SIATTLE THEN RETURNED TO COLLEGE AT STANDFORD WHEN I ARRIVED THERE THE CAMPUS HADN'T CHANGED BUT I HAD I FELT LIKE A GHOST AN HERE FOR A MOMENT G P T THREE SEEMS TO SIT WITH HER ON THAT FEELING I COULDN'T SPEAK I COULDN'T SLEEP I THEUGT

RESPONS I'M SORRY I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT BUT IT'S FIRSION FORWARD THIS ENTIRE EXCHANGE OF ALVS SH P T THREE STARTS BREAKING OUT OF CLUCHET AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WOHNI GIVES IT SOMETHING MORE POTENT TO WORK WISS JUST ONE ADDITIONAL SENS BUT IT FEELS LIKE A CONFESSION OF A SECRET HERE'S THE END OF WHA HENYS PROMPT I FELT LIKE A GHOST AT LIGHT MY SISTER WOULD APPEARE IN MY DREAMS S B T THREE

GHOST WHEN SHE MOVES TO ANEW CITY SHE'S PRETENDING TO MOVE ON BUT SHE CANNOT BTHUT EH I FOR THE FIRST TIME IS LINGERING IN HER SADNESS SO IN VERSION FIVE WOHENI TRIES TO BUILD ON THAT SUCCESS SHE POSES A NEW CHALLENGE TO G P T THREE LIKE A TEST SHE WRITES HERE I SHOULD CONJURE MY SISTER FOR YOU HERE I SHOULD DESCRIBE HER SO THAT YOU FEEL HER ABSENCE AS I DO SO THAT YOU'RE MADE GHOSTLY BY IT TO BUT THOUGH I'M A WRATER I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONJUR HER I REMEMBER THE SAME SMALL SET OF DETAILS SHE STOPPS THERE I REMEMBER THE SAME SMALL SET OF DETAILS COLL AND LINK SPACE IT'S A PROMPT MEANT TO

HOW YOU RESPONDED TO THIS LIKE LITTLE SCENE THAT IT RIGHTS FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER I MEAN THE WEIRD THING ABOUT THAT WAS THAT LIKE I PICTURE IN MY ACTUAL SISTER YOU KNOW LADIES ARE NOT THINGS THAT HAPPENED AT LEAST LIKE NOT IN THIS SERIES LIKE NOT IN THIS THE WAY THAT IT'S DESCRIBED HERE BUT LIKE THER'RE LITTLE BITS OF DIALOGUE THERE THAT ARE TRUE THAT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED YOU KNOW LIKE THE WAY THAT I THINK LIKE I'D BE IN MY ROOM AND CH BE IN HER ROOM AND LIKE I WOULD ASK IF SHE WAS IF SHE WAS AWAKE YOU KNOW AND LIKE SHE' BE LIKE YA ARE YOU WAS THERE SOMETHING NICE ABOUT IT ALMOST GIVING YOU LIKE KIND OF A NEW MEMORY WITH HER IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A NEW MEMORY LIKE I WOULDN'T YOU KNOW TEN YEARS SFROM NOW REMEMBER THIS PART OF THE ESSAY THAT THE A I ROTE AND LIKE MISTAKE IT FOR SOMETHING

HAVE NEW MEMORIES RAHT UP AND SO IT WAS LIKE IT FELT NICE IN THAT WAY READING SOMETHING LIKE SHE WAS STILL HOLDING MY HAND WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN I DIDN'T WANT HER TO LET GO I WANTED HER TO HOLD MY HAND FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IT'S HARD NOT TO WONDER HOW G P T THREE IS CONJURING SUCH A SPECIFIC FEELING THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE VAST LIBRARY OF WHAT HA'S BEEN FAID THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE WRITTEN ABOUT GOING TO CLARKBEACH WITH FAMILY OR PERHAPS AN AUTHOR WHO RECALLS HOLDING HANDS WITH SOME ONE THEYE LOSS AND THAT'S HOW G P T THREE NOWS THAT REMEMBERING THE TOUCH OF SOME ONE LONG GON CAN BREAK YOUR HEART IN THAT SENSE G P T THREES FUEL IS VERY HUMAN IT POLLSE FROM THE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE AND WORDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE WRITING THOSE THOUSANDS OF BLOGPOSTS AND ARTICLES AND NOVELS AND IN THIS CASE SYMPHASIZES IT INTO A REFLECTION OF OUR GREEF WELL UNDERSTANDING NONE OF IT WHICH OF COURSE IS THE STRANGEST THING ABOUT ALL THIS BUT THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS WOITH G B T THREE HAPPENS INVERSION AT IN THIS VERSION LA HEN STARTS WITH ALL THE PARTS WE KNOW DIAGNOSIS FEELING LIKE A GHOST TRYING TO DESCRIBE HER SISTER AND THEN G P T THREE JUMPS IN I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT FELT FOR ME I FELT I HAD LOST HALF OF MYSELF I FELT I HAD LOST MY RIGHT ARM I ELT I HAD LOST MY LEFT LEG I FELT I HAD LOST MY TONGUE I FELT I HAD LOST MY HOT I FELT I HAD LOST MY MIND I FELT I HAD LOST MY EYES I FELT I HAD LOST MY EARS I FELT I HAD LOST MY BREASS G P T THREE GETS CAUGHT IN ONE OF ITS REPETITIVE LOOPS HERE BUT FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME EVEN WITH ALL ITS BRILLIANCE THE A I CAN STILL BECOME LIKE THIS ROBOUT VACCIUM STUCK IN A CORNER SUCKING UP JERK FROM THE SAME PATCH OF FLOOR OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT IN THIS CASE G P T THREE THIT GETS STUCK SOMEWHERE USEFUL AND THE VERY MOLTEN COR OF A FEELING BIKE IN THIS NEXT PART WHERE TALKS ABOUT GRIEF FEELING LIKE AN ASTRONOT LOST IN SPACE I'M A GHOST AND I'M IN A SPACESHIP AND I'M HIDDLING THROUGH THE UNIVERSE ND I'M TRAVELLING FORWED AND IAM TRAVELLING BACKWAD AND IM TRAVELLING SIDEWAYS AND I'M TRAVELLING NO APYSHIP AND I'M GREELING ITS WERSON AND TRAVELL FORWARD AND TAVING BACK WERE AND THAT IT DISCONTINUES LIKE I MA GHOST AND I IN THE SPACHIP  AND I'M YOU GHOST AND I'M IN A SPACESHIP AND I'M HIDDLING THROUGH THE UNIVERSE AND I'M A GHOST AND I'M IN A SPACESHIP WADS LIKE THE ONE PART OF THE ESSAY THAT LIKE REALLY FEELS THE MOST I THINK LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY A MACHINE CAS A KIND OF IE GETS LOST IN ITS OWN AND REHERSIVENESS AND I'M A GHOST AND I'M IN A SPACESHIP AND I'M HIDDLING THROUGH THE UNIVERSE AND I'M A GHOST AND I'M IN A SPACESHIP A THEN THAT HAPPENS TO ALL SO VEETHE EXPERIENCE OF GRIEF WERE LIHE YOU FEEL UNTATHERD YOU FEELS HER TO LIKE LOST IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OF GRIEF LIKE YOU HAVE NO WAY OF TRENALIN IN A GREATER UNDERSTAND WHON'S GOING ON THIS AND I'M A GHOST AND I'M IN A SPACESHIP AND I'M HARTLING BOHINI SAYS G P T THREE REELING IN ITS CORNER WHENDED ON SOMETHING TRUE THAT GRIEF TURNS US INTO SOMETHING LIKE A BROKEN MACHINE STILL PERFORMING TASKS BUT POORLY HALF HAZARD WAY VIXATING ON THOUGHTS ND EMOTIONS THAT SEEMED TO SPEND ENDLESSLY AND M PUT THAT ON THE PAGE FOR ME AND THEN ONCE A PA THAT ON THE PAGE WAS ALMOST LIKE A RELIEF I WAS ALMOST LIKE O HAY IT DESCRIBE THE FEELING THAT I WANTED TO DESCRIBE IN THIS ESSAY AND I CAN COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT THE OTHER SIDE LOOKS LIKE IS VERSION NINE THE LAST ONE THIS ONE IS NOTABLE BECAUSE ITS ALMOST ALL LAHENY'S WRITING HER DOING THE THING THAT ONCE FELT SO HARD TO DO SHE LEFT ME A RECORDING OF HERSELF WHERE SHE GAVE ME ADVICE HER VOICE SOUNDED WEIRD AROUND THE TIME THAT SHE RECORDED IT THE WAY A PERSON'S VOICE SOMETIMES DOES WHEN THEY'VE GOTTEN THEIR MOUTH NEN BY THE DENTIST IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER CANCER BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THE MECHANICS I LOOKED IT UP ON LINE AND TOTHING CAME UP AND I DON'T ONE ASK ANY ONE SHE SAID IN HER MUFFLED VOICE THE HAPPIEST THING RIGHT NOW IS I LEARNED TO TALK OPENLY I WORKS REALLY REALLY WELLF TO DAY YOU THOUGHT I DIN'T WANT YOU TO COME TO THE SPACE NEEDLE SEMADE A FACE AT SINSANITY YOU HAVE TO TELL EVERYBODY WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN ASKED THEM WHAT THEY ONE DON'T HIDE ANYTHING TAKE CHANCES THE TAPE IS IN A BOX SOMEWHERE I'VE LISTENED TO IT ONLY A COUPLE OF TIMES THE SOUND OF HER VOICE IN IT FREETS ME OUT AROUND THE TIME SHE MADE THE TAPE SHE CHANGED IN A LOT OF WAYS ISHE'D ALSO GROWN RELIGIOUS SHE SAID SHE WAS READY TO DIE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT GAVE MY PARENTS PEACE BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS DELUTING HERSELF ER US ER BOUT BUT STANDS OUT TO ME ABOUT THIS VERSION IS HOW MATTER OF FACT IT IS IT'S HONEST LIKE SOME ONE TELLING A STORY WITHOUT EMBALLISHMENT SO DIFFERENT FROM THE TENATIVE SENTENCEF G SAT G P T THREE IN THIS EARLY VERSIONS EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD FEEL GOOD TO SAY LIE YES THE CONMY CONCLUSION HERE IS I WAS ABLE TO DO THIS ENTIRELY ON MY AW MI I DIDN'T NEED BE A EYE AT ALL IT'S IT'S LIKE THAT THE REALITY IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT THE REALITY BEING THAT G P T THREE AND IT'S AN ACCURACIES AND WILD STORY TELLING HAD CLEARED A PATH FOR WHAT H  TO WRITE JUST THE TRUTH SHE DID HOWEVER LET G P T THREE HAS THE LAST WORD THE LAST COUPLE SENESE WAS ACTUALLY SHE HAD A GENERATE ABUNCH OF OPTIONS FOR HER SIX PAGES OF OPTIONS AND THEN SHE CHOSE WHICH ONE FELT RIHTE HERE'S THE LAST PARAGRAPH THAT WHIT H M HERSELF WROTE ONCE UPON A TIME MY SISTER TAUGHT ME TO READ SHE TAUGHT ME TO WAIT FOR A MOSQUITO TO SWELL ON MY ARM AND THEN SLAP IT AND SEE THE BLOOD SPREAD OUT SHE TAUGHT ME TO INSULT RACIS BACK TO SWIM TO PRONOUNCE ENGLISH A I SOUNDED LESS INDIAN TO SHAVE MY LEGS WITHOUT CUTTING MYSELF TO LIE TO OUR PARENTS BELIEVABLY AND HEARE'S THE NDIN FROM G P T THREE THAT SHE CHOSE TID Y MAN TO TELL STORIES WONCE PLONNY TINE SHE TELT ME TO EXIST SHE ESPECIALLY LOVE THAT LAST SENTENCE BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SO MUCH PRETTY GOOD WRITING I'D SAY TEBUA HE'S AN EDITOR ON OR PROGRAMM THE WRITING DONE BY THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OF WHERE G P T THREE WAS READ BY LUCY TALOR WHY HE NI VARA FIRST TOLD THI STORY IN THE BELIEVER MAGAZINE YOU CAN READ THE FOOL VERSION ON LINE WITH ALL THE YEARE THINGS OF THE AR COMES UP WITH WIT TO CONDENSED THE DROM T RADIO YOU CAN FIND THAT AT BELIEVER MAG DOT CALM WHY HE NE HAS A BOOK COMING OUT THAT YOU CAN PREORDER CALLED THE IMMORTAL KING ROW I CUS US WEI TI A OCOMING UP A

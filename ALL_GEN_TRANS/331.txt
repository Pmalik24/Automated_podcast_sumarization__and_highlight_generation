PERSON YOU IFE TO CATCH IT AND HAVE A TESTIT AND IF YOU CAN'T CATCH IT YOU SHOULD GO TO A DOCTOR I'M SERIOUS I LEARNED ABOUT THIS IT FREEKED ME OUT AND NOW I WANT T TELL PEOPLE FOR MICHEL OF COURSE THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF EXPOSURE SHE HAD TWO FANG MARKS ON HER LEG RACOON BLOOD ALL OVER OUR CLOTHES AND A BATTERED RACOON CARCASS IN A PLASTIC BAG BUT GETTING TREATMENT PROVED TO BE ITS OWN TYPE OF FORER STORY FIRST SHE CALLED THE TAT HAN TOLD HER TO CALL THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT SHE CALED THE HALTH DEPARTMENT BUT THEY WERE CLOSED ON WEEKENS SO SHE LEFT THE MESSAGE AND CALLED ANOTHER HALTH DEPARTMENT AND A DIFFERENT COUNTY SAME THING EVENTUALLY SHE JUST WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM ON HER OWN WHERE SHE WAS TOLD THA THIS WASN'T AN EMERGENCY SHE HAD TEN TO FOURTEEN DAYS BEFORE SHE NEEDED TO

TWO RABBIT ANIMALS NUMBER THREE ITCHIKING AND BEFORE YOUR OWN PARENTS THIS I FELLY BRINGS AS TOO ACT  FOR A WILL GEN A LEARN A FEW MORE THINGS TO AVOID ACT FOR  GREVER SCHIFT HERE THE GHOSTS AND SKELETONS AND MONSTERS YOU RISE FROM THE GRAVEN HOLLOWIN ARE A KUNT OF UM FAKE CHILDRENS STORY VERSION OF DEATH BUT WANT HOLLOWING A COUPLE YEARS AGO A DIV ITSITERS TO SID HE WAS IN A GOAT FOR THE REAL THING ON HOLOWI NES CANT FOR THE REAL THING THE MEDICAL EXAMINERS OFFICE THE MORGUE BASICALY THE MORGUE A PLACE FILLED WITH ACTUAL DEAD PEOPLE HE READ HIS ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE AT THE OFFIAN THEATR IN AN THE APWAS THE THING ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE IS THAT THEY LOOK REALLY DEAD FAKE ALMOS LIKE MODELS MADE OF WACK THIS I LEARNED AT A MEDICAL EXAMINERS OFFICE I VISITED IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHILE THE BODIES SEEMED UNREAL THE TOOLS USED TO PICK THEM APART WERE DISTURBINGLY FAMILIAR IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN PLACES WITH BETTER FUNDING BUT HERE THEY USED HEDGE CLIPPERS TO SNIP THROUGH RED CAGES CHEST CAFITIES WERE EMPTIED OF BLOOD WITH CHEAT METAL SUIP LADLES THE KIND THEY USED IN CAFATERIAS AND THE ODD TOPSY TABLES WERE LUBRICATED WITH WHATEVER D ISSUTARGENT HAPPENED TO BE ON SAIL ALSO FAMILIAR WERE THE SONGS OLDIES MAINLY THAT ISSUED FROM THE BLOOD SPATTERED CLOCK RADIO AND FORMED A KIND OF SOUND TRACK WHEN I WAS YONG I ASSOCIATED THREE DOG NIGHT WITH MY SEVENTH GRAT SHOP TEACHER WHO PROUDLY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS THE GROUPS BIGGEST FAN NOW THOUGH WHENEVER I HEAR JOY TO THE WORLD I THINK OF A FIBROID TUMOR POSITIONED UPON A STYRAPHONE PLAYED FUNNY HOW THAT HAPPENS WHILE LET THE MEDICAL EXAMINERS OFFICE I DRESSED IN A PROTECTIVE SUIT COMPLET WITH HE BONNET IN A PAIR OF KIVEC BOOTIES CITIZENS WERE DISAND BOWELED ONE RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER AND ON THE SURFACE I'M SURE I SEEMED FINE WITH IT THEN AT NIGHT I'D RETURNED TO MY HOTEL DOUBLE LOCK THE DOOR AND STAND UNDER THE SHOWER UNTIL ALL THE SOAP AND CHAMPOO WAS USED UP THE PEOPLE IN THE NEXT ROOM MUST HAVE WONDERED WHAT WAS GOING ON AN HOUR OF RUNNING WATER AND THEN THIS BLUBBERY VOICE I DO BELIEVE IN SPOOKS I DO BELIEVE IN  I DO I DO I DO I DO IT'S NOT LUCK I'D WALKED INTO THIS COMPLETELY UNPREPARED EVEN AS A CHILD I WAS FASCINATED BY DEATH NOT IN A SPIRITUAL SENSE BUT AN INESTHETIC ONE I HAMPSTER ORGANY PID WOULD PASS AWAY AND AFTER BEARING THE BODY I DIG IT BACK O OVER AND OVER UNTIL ALL THAT REMAINED WAS A SHODDY PEL THAT EARN ME A CERTAIN REPUTATION ESPECIALLY WHEN I MOVED ON TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PATS EGOR THEY CALLED ME WICKED SPOOKY BUT I THINK MY INTEREST WAS ACTUALLY FAIRLY COMMON AT LEAST AMONGST ADOLESCENT BOYS AT THAT AGE DETH IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ONLY TO ANIMALS AND GRANDPARENTS AND STUDYING IT IS LIKE A SCIENCE PROJECT BE GOOD KIND THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE HOMEWORK MOST KIDS GROW OUT OF IT BUT THE PASSING OF TIME ONLY HEIGHTENED MY CURIOSITY AS A TEEN AGER I SAVED UP MY BABY SITTING MONEY AND BOUGHT A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR COPY OF MEDICOLEGAL INVESTIGATIONS OF DEATH A SORT OF BIBLE FOR FOR INS AT PATHOLOGISTS IT SHOWS WHAT YOU MIGHT LOOK LIKE IF YOU BIDDEN EXTENSION CORD WHILE STANDING IN A SHALLOW POOL OF WATER IF YOU WERE CRUSHED BY A TRACTOR STRUCK BY LIGHTNING STRANGLED WITH A SPIRAL OR NONSPIRAL TELEPHONE CORD KIT WITH A CLAW HAMMER BURN SHOT DROUND STAB OR FEASTED UPON BY WILD OR DOMESTIC ANIMALS THE CAMPTIONS RED LIKE REALLY GREAT POM TITLES MY FAVOURITE BEING EXTENSIVE MILL DO ON THE FACE OF A RECKLIS I STARED AT THAT PICTURE FOR OURS ON END HOPING IT MIGHT INSPIRE ME BUT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT POETRY AND THE BEST I CAME UP WITH WAS PRETTY LAME BEHOLD THE RECKLERS LOOKING PENSIVE MILL DO THOUGH IS QUITE EXTENSIVE ON HIS HEAD BOTH AFT AND FORE HE MAYBE SHOULD UG GOT OUT MORE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BY OLLOGY EITHER THE PATHOLOGIST TRIED TO EDUCATE ME BUT I WAS TOO DISTRACTED BY THE GROTESK MY DISCOVERY FOR INSTANCE THAT IF YOU JUMP FROM A TALL BUILDING AND LAND ON YOUR BACK YOUR EYES WILL POP OUT OF YOUR HEAD AND HANG BIGHT BLOODY CABLES LIKE THOSE JOKE GLASSES I SAID TO THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER THE MAN WAS NOTHING IF NOT PROFESSIONAL AND IS RESPONSE TO MY OBSERVATIONS WAS ALWAYS THE SAME WELL HE'D SIGH NOT REALLY AFTER A WEEK IN THE ODTOPSY SWEET I STILL COULDN'T OPEN A DENY'S MENIA WITHOUT WANTING TO THROW OFF UT NIGHT I'D CLOSE MY EYES AND SEE THE BUCKETS OF WITHERED HAND STORED IN THE MORG SECONDARY COOLER THEY HAD BRAINS TOO A WHOLE WALL OF THEM SHELLED LIKE PRESERVES AN A GENERAL STORE THEN THERE WERE THE BITS IN PIECES A FORSAKEN TORSO A PRETTY BLOND SCALP A PAIR OF EYES FLOATING AND A BABY FOOD JAR BUT THEM ALL TO GETHER AND YOU HAD AN INCREDIBLY GRIGT SECRETARY WHO COULD TIGHT LIKE THE WIND BUT NEVER ANS ER THE TELEPHONE UT LIE A WAKE THINKING OF THINGS LIKE THIS BUT THEN MY MIND WOULD RETURNED TO THE FRESHLY DEAD WHO WERE A MOST OFTEN WHOLE OR AT LEAST WHOLE ISH MOST OF THEM WERE DELIVERED NAKED ZIPDOP BIN IDENTICAL BODY BAGS FAMILY MEMBERS WERE NOT ALLOWED INSIDE THE BUILDING AND SO THE CORPSES HAD NO CONTECT ON CONNECTED TO THE LIVING THEY WERE LIKE THESE STRANGE CREATURES RELATED ONLY TO ONE ANOTHER A POLISE REPORT WOULD EXPLAIN THAT MISSUS DANIELS HAD BEEN KILLED WHEN A TROCK LOST CONTROL AND DROVE TO THE FRONT WINDOW OF A HAMBURGER STAND SHE HAD BEEN A CUSTOMER WAITING IN LINE IN CASES LIKE HERS I NEEDED MORE THAN A STANDED REPORT THERE HAD TO BE A REASON THIS WOMAN WAS RUN DOWN AS WITHOUT ONE THE SAME THING MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME THREE MEN ARE SHOT TO DEATH WHILE I TENDING A CH ILD'S CHRISTENING AND YOU TELL YOURSELF SURE THEY WERE HANGING OUT WITH THE WRONG CROWD BUT BUYING A HAMBURGER I BUY HAMBURGERS FAR I USED TO ANYWAY THIS MEDICAL EXAMINERS OFFICE WAS IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AND A CITY WHERE GONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE AND DRIVERS ARE KNOWN TO SHOOT EACH OTHER OF HER PARKING SPACES THE BUILDING WAS LOS SLUNG AND MEAN LOOKING SAT ON THE FAR EDGE OF THE DOWN TOWN AREA BETWEEN THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND A RUBBER STAMP MANUFACTURER AND THE LOBBY WAS THE POTTED PLANT AND A RECEPTIONAS WHO KEPT A CAN OF MOUNTAIN GLAN AIR FRESHENER AN HER DESK DRAWER FOR DECOMPS SHE EXPLAINED MEANING TOST WHO HAD DIED ALONE AND ROTTERED A WHILE BEFORE BEING FOWND WE HAD SUCH A CASE ON HOLLOWEEN AND ELDERLY MAN WHO HAD TUMBLED FROM A LATTER WHILE WE PLACING A LIGHTBALB FOR AND A HALF DAYS ON THE FLOOR OF HIS UNAIR CONDITIONED HOME AND AS THE BAG WAS UNSIPPED THE ROOM FILLED WITH WHAT THE ATTENDING PATHOLOGIST TERMED THE SMELL OF JOB SECURITY THE AUTOPSY TOOK PLACE IN THE MORNING AND WAS THE BEST ARGUMENT FOR THE BUDDY SYSTEM I HAD EVER SENNEVER LIVE ALONE I TOLD MI TBEFORE YOU CHANGE A LIGHT BULB CALL SOME ONE FROM THE OTHER ROME AND HAVE THEM WATCH UNTIL YOU'RE FINISHED BY THIS POINT IN M STAY MY LIST OF DONTS COVERED THREE PAGES AND INCLUDED SUCH REMINDERS AS NEVER FALL ASLEEP AND A DUMSTER NEVER DRIVE A CONVERTIBLE BEHIND A FLAT BED TRO NEVER GET DRONKNEAR A TRAIN NEVER GET OLD I HADN'T TIMED MY VISIT TO COINCIDE WITH HOLOWEEN BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKED OUT YOU THINK THAT MOST OF THE CASUALTIES WOULD INVOLVE TRICKER TREATERS HIT BY CARS OR DONE IN BY TAINTED CANDY BUT ACTUALLY THE DAY WAS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER AN THE MORNING WE HAD OUR DECOMPOSED SENIOR AND AFTER LUNCH I ACCOMPANIED A FEMALE PATHOLOGIST TO A MURDER TRIAL SHE HAD PERFORMED THE VICTIMS AUTOPSY AND WAS TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE PROSECUTION THERE WERE PLENTY OF THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE CONCERNED ME THE BLOOD SPATTER EVIDENCE THE TROJECTORY OF THE BULLETS BUT ALL I COULD CONCENTRATE ON WAS THE DEFENDANC'S MOTHER WHO'D COME TO COURT WHERING CUT OFF GENES AND A GHOST BUSTERS TEACER IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY FOR HER BUT STILL YOU HAD TO WONDER WHAT WOOD SHE CONSIDER A DRESS UP OCCASION AFTER THE TRIAL I WATCHED AS ANOTHER FEMALE PATHOLOGIST COLLECTED MAGGETS FROM A PINAL COLUMN FOUND IN THE DESERT THERE WAS A DECOMPOSED HEAD TOO AND BEFORE LEAVING WORK SHE PLANNED TO SIMMER IT AND STUDY THE EXPOSED CRANIUM FOR CONTUSIONS I WAS ASKED TO PASS THIS INFORMATION ALONG TO THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER AND LOOKING BACK I PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN MY WORDS MORE CAREFULLY FIRE UP THE KETTLE I TOLD HIM OLD FASHIONED SKULL BOIL AT FIVE P MIT WAS OF COURSE THE FEAR TALKING THAT AND A'T PATHETIC DESIRED TO APPEAR CASUAL ONE OF THE GANG THAT EVENING INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO MY HOTEL I SAT AROUND WITH THE TRANSPORTERS ONE OF WHOM HAD RECENTLY BEEN TICKETED FOR USING THE CARPOOL LANE AND AT ARGUED UNSUCCESSFULLY THAT THE DEAD BODY HE WAS CARRYING IN THE BACK CONSTITUTED A SECOND PASSENGER IT WAS JUST THE FOUR OF US UNTIL AROUND MIDNIGHT WHEN A TIPSY MAN IN A DATONA BEACHS WEATSHIRT CAME TO THE FRONT GATE AND ASKED FOR A TAR WHEN TOLD NO HE GESTURED TOWARD AN IDLING CAR AND GOT HIS GIRL FRIEND TO ASK THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS LOVELY AND FLORTATIOUS AND AS SHE PRESSED HERSELF AGAINST THE BARS I IMAGINED HER LYING UPON AN AUTOPSY TABLE HER ORGANS PILED IN A GLISTENING HEAT BESIDE HER I NOW LOOKED AT EVERY ONE THIS WAY AND IT WORRIED ME THAT I'D NEVER BE ABLE TO STOP THIS WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF SEEING TOO MUCH AND UNDERSTANDING THE HORRIBLE TRUTH NO ONE IS SAFE THE WORLD IS NOT MANAGEABLE THE TRICKER TREATER MAY NOT BE STRUCK DOWN ON HOLLOWEN BUT SOONER OR LATER HE IS GOING TO GET IT AS AM I AND EVERYONE I HAVE EVER CARED ABOUT IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I WAS NOT MUCH FUN TO LIVE WITH AND EARLY NOVEMBER I RETURNED HOME AND REPELLED EVERY SINGLE PERSON I CAME INTO CONTACT WET GRADUALLY THOUGH MY GLOOMINESS WORE OFF BI THANKSGIVING I WAS IMAGINING PEOPLE NAKED RATHER THAN DEAD AND NAKED AND THIS WAS AN IMPROVEMENT A WEEK LATER I WAS BACK TO SMOKING IN BED AND JUST AS I THOUGHT THAT I'D PUT IT ALL BEHIND ME I WENT TO MY NEIGHBOURHOOD GROCERY STORE AND SAW AN ELDERLY WOMAN SLIP ON A GRAPE SHE FELL HARD AND AFTER RUNNING TO HER SIDE I TOOK HER BY THE ARM YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH YOURSELF IN THIS PRODUCEILE I KNOW IT SHE SAID I COULD HAVE BROKEN MY LEG ACTUALLY I TOLD HER YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED THE WOMAN ATTEMPTED TO STAND BUT I WOULDN'T LET HER I'M SERIOUS I TOLD HER PEOPLE DIE THIS WAY I'VE SEEN IT HER EXPRESSION CHANGED THEN AND BECAME FEARFUL RATHER THAN MERELY PAIN IT WAS THE LOOK YOU GET WHEN FACING SOME SUDDEN AND INSURMOUNTABLE DANGER THE ERRANT TRUCK THE SHAKY LATER THE CRAZY PERSON WHO HOLDS YOU TOO TIGHT AND INSISTS WITH EVER INCREASING URGENCY THAT EVERYTHING YOU KNOW AND LOVE CAN BE UN DONE BY A GRAPE TITE TERE E EAE SEVERAL BOOKS MOS RESENTLY LOOK SO   WE BO MIS POTIS TO DAY BY JAMBERY AND MYSELF ABOUTSO BO BANK COK WIS APOLICLIS SOBOLIS EOPAN NESEPT I

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAN SCIENCE SCIENCE TACE TOCE I MANDRUW HUBERMEN AND O A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AN OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY GUEST TO DAY IS DOCTOR DAVID BUSS DOCTOR BUSS IS A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTIN AND HE IS ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS AND LUMINARIES IN THE FIELD OF EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY DOCTOR BUSS IS LABORATORY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE STRATEGIES THAT HUMANS USE TO SELECT MATES IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM AND HE IS AN EXPERT IN SEX DIFFERENCES IN MATING STRATEGY HIS LABORATORY IS EXPLORED FOR INSTANTE WHY WOMEN CHEAT ON THEIR SPOUSES OR THEIR LONG TERM PARTNERS AS WELL AS WHY MEN TEND TO CHEAT ON THEIR SPOUSES AND LONG TERM PARTNERS HE'S ALSO EXPLORED A NUMBER OF THINGS RELATED TO THE COURTSHIP DANCE THAT WE CALL DATING AND SECURING A MATE INCLUDING THE USE OF DECEPTION RELATED TO PROCLAMATIONS OF LOVE OR PROMISES OF FINANCES OR SEXUAL ACTIVITY DOCTOR BUS IS LABORATORY HAS ALSO AVALUATED HOW STATUS IS ASSESSED MEANING HOW WE EVALUATE OUR OWN WORTH ND OUR POTENTIAL AS A MATE AND WHO IS LET'S JUST SAY WITHIN RANGE OF A POTENTIAL MATE BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM FOR INSTANCE TODAY WE TALK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE DON'T JUS MAKE DIRECT ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR OWN AND OTHER PEOPLE'S VALUE AS A POTENTIAL MATE BUT ALSO USING THE ASCESSMENTS OF OTHERS TO INDIRECTLY DETERMINE WHETHER NOT THEY STAND A CHANCE OR NOT IN SECURING SOMEBODY AS A SHORT OR LONG TERM MATE HIS LABORATORY HAS ALSO FOCUSED ON SOME OF THE COMPLICATED AND VARIED EMOTIONS RELATED TO MATING LOVE IN RELATIONSHIPS SUCH AS LUST AND JEALOUSY AND HIS EXTENSIVELY EXPLORED SOMETHING CALLED MATE POACHING OR THE VARIOUS STRATEGIES THAT MEN AND WOMEN USE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON THAT THEY WANT TO BE WITH OR THE PERSON THEY ARE WITH IS NOT WITH ANYONE ELSE OR SEEKING ANYONE ELSE AND INDEED THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T SEEK THEIR MATE DOCTOR BUSS S WORK ALSO RELATES TO HOW BI LOGICAL INFLUENCES SUCH AS OVULATION OR TIME WITHIN THE MENSTUAL PSYCLE INFLUENCES MATE SELECTION OR TENDENCY TO HAVE SEX OR NOT WITH A POTENTUAL SHORT OR LONG TERM MATE AND MORE RECENT WORE FROM DOCTOR BUSS'S LABORATORY FOCUSES ON THE DARKER ASPECTS OF MATING AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN HUMANS INCLUDING STALKING AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO DAY WE DISCUSS ALL THOSE TOPICS WE ALSO DISCUSS SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT HUMANS CAN USE TO MAKE HEALTHY MATE SELECTION CHOICES AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY IN COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS TO INSURE HEALTHY PROGRESSION OF THOSE COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS IN ADDITION TO PUBLISHING DOZENS OF LANDMARK SCIENTIFIC STUDIES DOCTOR BUSS IS AUTHORED MANY IMPORTANT BOOKS A FEW OF THOSE INCLUDE THE EVOLUTION OF DESIRE AND WY WOMEN HAVE SECS AND HIS MOST RECENT BOOK IS THE ONE THAT I 'M READING NOW WHICH IS CALLED WHEN MEN BEHAVE BADLY THE HIDDEN ROOTS OF SECUAL DICEPTION HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT AND IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING REED IT HAS INDORSEMENTS FROM DOCTOR ROBERT SUPULSKI PROFESSOR STAMFORD WHO'S BEEN ON THIS PODCAST AS A GUEST BEFORE AS WELL AS STEPHEN PINKER AND JONATHAN HATE WHO WROTE THE CODDLING OF THE AMERICAN MIND IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT BOOK I BELIEVE AND ONE THAT DOESN'T JUST GET INTO THE DARKER ASPECTS OF HUMAN MATING BEHAVIOR AND VBIOLENCE BUT ALSO STRATEGIES THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE TO INSHORE HEALTHY MATING BEHAVIOR AND RELATIONSHIPS THERE'S SO MUCH RUMOR SPECULATION AND OUTRIGHT FABRICATION OF IDEAS ABOUT WY HUMAN SELECT PARTICULAR MATES IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM WHAT MEN AND WOMEN DO DIFFERENTLY AND SO ON WHAT I LOVE ABOUT DOCTROBUSIS WORK IS THAT IT'S GROUNDED IN LABORATORY STUDIES THAT ARE HIGHLY QUANITATIVE USING RIGOROUS STATISTICS AND SO THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU'LL NOTICE THAT I'M RAPPED WITH ATTENTION TRYING TO EXTRACT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I CAN FROM DOCTORBUS ABOUT THE REAL SCIENCE OF HUMAN MATE SELECTION AND MATING STRATEGY I'M CERTAIN THAT EVERY ONE WILL TAKE AWAY EXTREMELY VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY CAN USE IN EXISTING OR FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS FROM THIS DISCUSSION WITH DOCTROBUS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ALETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED

PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIAM MANESIUM IN PETASTIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLIYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONT SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THA YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT

HUBERMAN AND NOW MY CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR DAVID BUS DAVID DELIGHTED TO BE HERE I'VE FOLLOWED YOUR WORK FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND A MEXCITE O ASK YOU A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IS SUPER INTERESTING TOPICS ABOUT HOW PEOPLE SELECT MATES HOW THEY LIE CHEAT AND A BUT ALSO BEHAVE WELL IN THE THIS DANCE THAT WE CALL MAKE CHOICE YES YE FORTUNATELY THERE ARE THERE ARE A WELL BEHAVING HUBANS IN THE IN THE MIXERE GOOD TO KNOW A JUST TO START OFF AM PERHAPS YOU COULD JUST ORIENTOUS A LITTLE BIT A ABOUT MATE CHOICE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PRIMARY CRITERIA THAT STUDY SHOW MEN AND WOMEN USE IN ORDER TO SELECT MATES BOTH A SHALL WE CALL THEM A TRANSIENT MATES AS WELL AS A LIFETIME MATES RIHT WELL THAT'S THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR IN A LONG TERM COMMITTED MATE SHIP LIKE A MARRIAGE PARTNER OR LONG TER ROMANTIC RELATSHIP IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR IT A IN A HOOK UP OR CASUAL SECTS OR ONE LIGHT STAND OR EVEN A BRIEF AFFAIR A SO AM SO THAT'S ACTUALLY CRITICAL ONEVEIF WE CAN MAY BE SBACK UP A SECOND AND JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING MATE THOICE OR SO I IT BASICALLY STEMS FROM DARWIN'S THERY OF SEXUAL SELECTION AND MOST PEOPLE WON THEY THINK ABOUT EVOLUTION THEY THINK ABOUT A CLESHAS LIKE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST OR NATURE REDINTOTH AN CLAW AND DARWIN NOTICE THAT THERE WERE PHENOMENA THAT COULDN'T BE EXPLAINED BY THIS SO CALLED SURVIVAL SELECTION THINGS LIKE THE BRILLIANT PLUMAGE OF PEACOCKS A SEX DIFFERENCES LIK CAN YOU KNOW STAGS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE THESE MASSOF ANPLERS AND THE FEMALES OF THE SPECIES DO NOT AND SO YE COME UP WITH TEORY OF SEXUAL SELECTION WHICH DEALS NOT WITH THE EVOLUTION OF CHARACTERISTICS DUE TO THEIR SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE BUT RATHER DUE TO THEIR MATING ADVANTAGE AND HE IDENTIFY TWO CAUSAL PROCESSIES BY WHICH MATING ADVANTAGE COULD OCCURR ONE IS INTEROSEXUAL COMPETITION WITH THE STERITYPE BEING TWO STAGS LOCKING HARRANS IN COMBAT WITH THE VICTOR GAINING SEXUAL ACCESS TO THE FEMALE LOS OR AMBLING OFF WITH A BROKEN ANTLER AND DEJECTED IN LOW SELF ESTEEM AND NEEDING PSYCHOTHERAPY PERHAPS OR WERE MATE MATE MATE A VALUE IMPROVEMENT THERAPY A AN THE LOGIC WAS WHATEVER QUALITIES LED TO SUCCESS IN THE SAME SEX BATTLES THOSE QUALITIES GET PASSED ON IN GREATER NUMBERS AS  YE SEE EVOLUTION WHICH IS CHANGE OVER TIME IN INCREASE IN FREQUENCY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH WINNING THESE WHAT DORE ONE CALL CONTEST COMPETITION AND WE KNOW THAT LOGIC OF THAT IS MORE GENERAL NOW AN ENVOLSE TINGS LIKE IN OUR SPECIES COMPETING FOR POSITION AN STATUS HIERARCHIES SO ANYWATE O INTROSEXUAL COMPETITION IS ONE BUT THE SECOND MOST RELEVENT TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT MATE CHOICE IS PREFERENTUAL MATE CHOICE THAT WAS THE SECOND CAUSAL PATHWAY AND THE LOGIC THERE IS THAT IF MEMBERS OF ONE SEX AGREE WITH ONE ANOTHER IF THEIR SOME CONSENSES ABOUT THE QUALITIES THAT ARE DESIRED THAN THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX WHO POSSESS THE DESIRED QUALITIES OR EMBODY THOSE DESIRED QUALITIES THEY HAVE A MATING ADVANTAGE THEY GET CHOSEN THEY GET PREFERRED THOSE LACKING DESIRED QUALITIES GET BANISHED SHUND IGNORETR WERE IN THE MODERN OF OURM BECOME INCELLS AND SO THE LOGIC THER IS VERY SIMPLE BUT ALSO VERY POWERFUL AND THAT IS THAT A WHATEVER QUALITIES ARE DESIRED CON SENTUALLY DESIRED IF THEIR SOMEHERITABLE BASIS TO THOSE THAN THOSE INCREASE IN FREQUENCY OVER TIME AND SO AND IN IN THE HUMAN CASE THESE TWO A CAUSAL PROCESSIES OF SEXUAL SELECTION ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER IN THAT THE PREFERENCES OF THE MATE PREFERENCES OF ONE SEX BASICALLY SET THE GROUND RULES FOR COMPETITION IN THE OPPOSITE SECT SO IF FOR EXAMPLE HYPOTHETICALLY WOMEN A PREFERRED TO MATE WITH MEN WHO WERE ABLE AND WILLING TO DEVOTE RESOURCES TO THEM THAND THAT WOULD CREATE COMPETITION ON AMONG MEN TO QUAW THEIR WAY YO OW AND BEAT OUT OTHER MEN IN RESOURCE ACQUISITION AND THAN DISPLAYING THAT THEIR WILLINGTESS TO COMMIT THAT TO A PARTICULAR WOMEN AND SAME WITH WOMEN TTHAT HIS ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT HUMANS IS THAT WE HAVE MUTUAL MATE CHOICE WHICH IS NOT TRUE IN ALL SPECIES SO AND THAT IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF YOU KNOW YOU SELECTING SOME ONE TO BE YOUR MATE THEY HAVE TO RESIPROCALLY SELECT YOU AND SO WITH MUTUAL MATE MATE CHOICE A WE HAVE BOTH PREFERENCES MATE PREFERENCES THAT WOMEN HAVE AND MATE PREFERENCES THAT MEN HAVE IN CONSEQUENTLY COMPETITION AMONG MEN FOR ACCESS TO THE MOST DESIRABLE WOMEN IN COMPETITION AMONG WOMEN FO R ACCESS TO THE MOST DESIRABLE MEN SO THAT SORT OF A LITTLE BIT OF THEORETICAL BACKDROP A SO YOU ASKEDABLE WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES THAT MEN AND WOMEN DESIRE AND MAYBE WILL START WITH A LONG TERMATING AND THEN SHIFT TO SHORT TERMATING AND LONG TERMATING IS IS INTERESTING IN AN OF ITSELF IN THAT ITS VERY RARE IN THE MAMALIAN WORLD SO THERE MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND SPECIES OF PRIMATES OF WHICH AO'M SORY MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND SPECIES OF MAMMELS OF WHICH WE ARE ONE BU ON THE PERCENTAGE OF MAMBELS THAT HAVE ANYTHING RESEMBLING LIKE A PARABOND OF LONG TERMATING STRATEGY S ABOUT THREE TO FIVE PER CENT ITS EXTREMELY RARE AN EVEN ARE CLOSEST PRIMATE RELATIVES THE CHIMPANZEESE A A THEY DON'T HAVE A LONG TERMATING STRATEGY THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RESEMBLING PAIRBOND AND MATING HIM IN THE CHIMPS THE FEMALES COMEING TO ESTRAS ALMOST ALL THE SEXUAL ACTIVITY OCCURS DURING THAT ESTRA PHASE AFTER THAT MALES AND FEMALES BASICALLY IGNORE EACH OTHER A FOR THE MOST WITH SOME SOME EXCEPTIONS A BUT WITH HUMANS YOU HAVE THE EVOLUTION OF LONG TERM PAIRBONDING ATTACHMENT A HEAVY A MALE AND VESTMEN IN OFFSPRING A A RELATIVELY CONCEALED OBULATION A AND SO AND SO THESE ARE KIND OF UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE HUMAN MATING SYSTEM SO ASO TO GET TO YOUR QUESTION A SO WELL WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES SO THE THTHE BEST T THE MOST LARGE SCALES STUDI THIS BEEN DONE THIS IS STUDY THAT I DID AWILE BACK OF THIRTY SEVEN DIFFERENT CULTURES AND HAS NOT BEEN REPLICATED BY OTHER RESEARCURES BUT BASICALLY WHAT WE FOUND AS THREE CLUSTERS OF THINGS WE FOUND QUALITIES THAT BOTH THE MEN AND WOMEN WANTED IN A LONG TERMATE WE FOUND SOME QUALITIES THAT WERE SEX DIFFERENTIATED WERE WOMEN PREFER THAN MORE THAN MEN WERE MEN PREFERRED THN MORE THAN WOMEN AND THE WE FOUND SOME ATTRIBUTES THAT WERE HIGHLY VERIABLE A CROSS CULTURES IN WEATHER PEOPLE FOUND TIES AS DESIRABLE INDISPENSABLE OR IRRELEVANT INTIMATE AND SO I COULD GIVE EXAMPLES OF EACH OF THESE IF THA YET OU BEGREAT I I LOVE TO KNOW A WHAT SOME OF THE COMMON THEMES WERE ACROSS THESE CULTURES AND TERMS OF WHAT WHAT'S BEYOND SECH THE MATAN SEXUALLY SELECTED FOR YE O O SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE  SO TUCK BY UNIVERSAL DESIRE TO THINGS THAT MEN AND WOMEN SHARE A THERE THINGS LIKE INTELLIGENCE A KINDNESS A MUTUAL ATTRACTION AND LOVE A WHICH IS REALLY KIND OF HEART WORMING AS SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT A LOVE IS A ARECENT WESTERN INVENTION BY SOME EUROPEAN A POETS BUT IT TURNS OUT IS NOT TRU YOU GO TO THE CLUNSTON AND BOSOUANA A AND THEY DESCRIBE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS A FALLING IN LOVE AS AS WE DO AND EVEN DESCRIBE THE DISTINCTION BE TWEEN THIS KIND OF INFATUATION STAGE OF LOVE AND THE ATTACHMENT PASE WERE YOU KNOW U YOU CAN'T MAINTAIN THIS FRENZY OF INFATUATION AN OBSESSION FOR VERY LONG SIX WEEKS MAY BE SIX MONTHS AT MOST ON AOTHERWAS YOU CAN GET NOTHING ELSE DONE IN YOUR LIFE AND OF THOSE OF THOSE DOPENME IN CIRCUITS FIRING AND I FREQUENCY YE A YET SO SO O SO MUTUAL ATTRACTION LOVE ON A GOOD HEALTH A A DEPENDABILITY AEMOTIONAL STABILITY ALL THHERE'S A BIT OF A SEX DIFFERENCE THERE WITH WOMEN PREFERRING IT A BIT MORE THAN MEN AN AND SO BASICALLY AND TH AN THESE MAY SEEM OBVIOUS SO NO ONE WANTS A STUPID MEAN UGLY DISEASE RIDDEN MADE AND SO PERHAPS OBVIOUS BUT A BUT NO ONE DO THIS IN ADVANCE OF THE THIRTY SEVEN CULTURE STUDY SO THESE WERE SOME UNIVERSAL PREFERENCES SO YOU GO TO THE ZULU TRIBE IN SOUTH AFRICA OR A YOU KNOW A REODEGANERA AND BRAZIL OR A PORTUBL OR OSLOW A OR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT PEOPLE UNIVERSALLY DESIRE IN LONG TERM MATES SEX DIFFERENCES SO SEX DIFFERENCE IS BASICALLY FELL INTO TWO CLUSTERS SO WOMEN MORE THAN MEN PRIORITIZED GOOD EARNING CAPACITY A SLIGHTLY OLDER AGE AAND THE QUALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH RESOURCE ACQUISITION SO THE THESE ARE THINGS LIKE A MAN'S SOCIAL STATUS A DOES HE HAVE DRIVE IS THE AMBITIOUS A IT DOES HE HAVE A GOOD LONG TRM RESOURCE TRAJECTORYIS ONE WAY THAT I LIKE TO PHRASE IT BECAUSE WOMEN OFTEN THEY DON'T LOOK IT NECESSARILY A THE RESOURCES THAT A GUOD POSSESSES AT THIS MOMENT BUT WHAT IS HIS TRAJECTORY AN SAS A JUST ARCHIN TRUB BUT MAY ASK A IS THERE ANYTHING KNOWN O AABOUT THE COMMONALITIES OF HOW THAT IS A SEST YOU KNOW IT IS IT A YOU KNOW HE'S ROLLING OUT O BED EARLY AND A RUNNING EIGHT MILES A HE'S SHOWING PROFICIENCY IN SCHOOL A HE HANDLES HIMSELF WELL SOCIALLY A PARTIES IS DRINKING TOO MUCH BUT KNOWS WHAT YOU KNOW VIN OBYOUSEY THEIR INTERGRATING MULTIPLE CUSES THE BRAIN AS A COMPLEX PLACE BUT IT AT IS THERE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THOSE VARIABLES OR ACROSS CULTURES YA WELL I THINK THAT A I THERE'S BEEN LESS ATTENTION TO THAT SHATS A GREAT QUESTION A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO KNOW ACROSS CULTURES IS THAT WOMEN ATTEND TO THE ATTENTION STRUCTURE SO A THE ATTENTION STRUCTUREIS A KEY DETERMINE OF STATUS SO AS PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGH EN STATUS ARE THOSE TO WHOM THE MOST PEOPLE PAY THE MOST ATTENTION OLSO THE ATTENTION OF OTHERS TO THEM NOT HOW WELL A GIVEN POTENTIAL MATE PA ONFOKESS IN PAY ATTENTION YES IRILY YES EXACTLY AND BUT BUT  BUT WOMEN LOOK I MEAN YOU KNOW A IT IS THE GUY EVEN IN THE MODERN ENVIRONMENT AS THE GUY SPENDING EIGHT HOURS A DAY PLAYING VIDIO GAMES A A EATING CHEATOS IN DRINKING BEER OR IS HE A DEVOTING EFFORT TO HIS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT A SO HARD WORK A AMBITION DOES HE HAVE CLEAR GOALS OR IS HE IN AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS NOT KNOWING WHAT IS GOING TO DO WITH HIS LIFE A SO THOSE ARE SOME THE QUALITIES THAT THAT THAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR AND ALSO WOMEN USE A WHAT'S CALLED IN LITERATURE MATE CHOICE COPYING AND THIS IS RELATED IN PARTS TO THE ATTENTION STRUCTURE THAT IS GUYSE WHO HAVE O A PASS THE PHILTERS OF MULTIPLE WOMEN A THOSE AR A LIKE A A PREAPPROVED PREAPPROVEMEND SO WE'VE DONE STUDIES WEARE YOU JUST TAKE A GUY PHOTOGRAPHED HIM ALON A VERSIS TAKE THE SAME GUY PUT AN ATTRACTIVE WOMEN NEXT OR PUT TWO WOMEN NEXT TO EM AND WOMEN JUDGE EXACTLY THE SAME GUY TO BE MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE IF THEREIS IF THER AR ES PAIRED WITH WOMEN THAN I THEN THEN IF HEIS NOT AND SO AND SOME GUYS EXPLOIT THIS IN THE MODERN WORLD BY HIRING WING WOMEN TO GO WITH EM ON DATES ANDS OF FORE THIS IS MY MY SISTER AFORMER ROAL FRIEND OR WHATEVER A SO A A BUT A BUT BUT BR CORRECT IN IN MIN THE WOMEN USE MULTIPLE CUSE TO ASSESS THESE THINGS A AND THEY CHANGE EVER TIME AND A SO A IN IN THE MODERN VIRONMENT EVEN THINGS LIKE THE ATTENTION STRUCTURE TOS THIS GUY HAVE A MILLION TWITTO TRITTER FOLLOWERS OR THREE TWITTER FOLLOWERS A SO A THAT IS AN INDEX OF THE ATTENTION STRUCTURE AND HENCE THE STATUS OF THE GU WITHIN THE BROUHTER COMMUNITY ASO AN AND FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE IS REASONABLE THAT WOMEN WOULD PRIORITIES THESE QUALITIES BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS A SYMETRY IN OUR REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY NAMELY THAT FERTILIZATION OCCURS INTERNALLY WITHIN WOMEN NOT WITHIN MEN WOMEN BEAR THE THE BURDENS OF THE NINE MONTH PREGNANCY WHICH IS METABOLICALLY EXPENSIVE AS WELL AS CREATING OPPORTUNITY COSTS IN TERMS OF MOBILITY AND INSOLVING OTHER TASKS THAT PEOPLE NEED DISSOLVE IN THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES AND SO A ONE WAY TO PHRASE THAT IS THAT THE COSTS OF MAKING A BAD MATE CHOICE ARE MUCH HEAVIER FOR WOMEN WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL BEHAVIOR CERTAINLY A BECAUSE ONM IT A ND THE THE BENEFITS CORRESPONDINGLY OF MAKING A WISE MATE TOICE AR HIGHER FOR WOMEN IN THE SEXUAL CONTEXT A BUT AS I SAID WE HAVE MUTE MUTUAL MATE CHOICE IN OUR SPECIES AND SO WHAT DO MEN VALUE MORE THAN WOMEN A PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS A THEY WRAKE THAT MUT AS A A MORE IMPORTANT CRITERIA THAN DO WOMEN ABOUT MEN YES YET EXACT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS COLL CONSISTENTLY IT IS NOT THAT WOMEN ORE ARE ARE A INDIFFERENT TO IT SO WOMEN DO PAY ATTENTION TO A GUISE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE IS HIS FITNESS AND SO FORTH IN GUISE ARE ACTUALLY OFF BASE IN THE A THINKING THAT WOMEN PREFER MORE MUSCULAR MEN THAN THEY ACTUALLY DO SO LIKE IN MUSCLE MAGAZINES THESE MEN WITH BULGING BISEPS AND SO FORTH WOMEN DON'T FIND THAT ESPECIALARY BUT THEY DO PRIRTIZED FIT MEN A GOOD SHOULDER TO HYPORATIO AND OTHER QUALITIES OF PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AS WELL AS THINGS LIKE A CUSE TO HEALTH SA IN PHYSICSO PHYSICAL APPEARANCE PROVIDES A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON'S HEALTH STAT US BUT ALSO PROVIDES FOR MEN A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT WOMEN'S FERTILITY A HER REPRODUCTIVE VALUE NON NOT THAT MEN THINK ABOUT THAT CONSCIOUSLY AND YOU MEN DON'T WALK DOWN THE STREET AND SEE OF WOMEN AND THEY A FIND HER ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE I THINK SHE MUST BE VERY FERTILE A MAYBE A FEW WEARD PEOPLE DO THAT BUT MOST MEN JUST IS LIKE A THEY JUST FIND THOSE CUES ATTRACTIVE AND THE CES ARE CUS ASSOCIATE WITH YOUTH AND HEALTH BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOUTH IS A VERY POWERFUL CUE TO FERTILITY AND REPRODUCTIE VALUE SO MEN PRIRADISE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE IN AND IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY IT USED TO I WAYS TAUGHT WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE THAT YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER THAT PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS WAS INFINITELY ARBITRARY INFINITELY CULTURALLY VARIABLE AND AND IT SIMPLY NOT TRUE WE KNOW NOW BASED ON THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC A STUDIES THAT THE CUSE THAT MEN FUNNIN TOTRACTIVE WOMEN ARE NOT AT ALL ARBITRARY A THERE IS SOME VARIATION ACROSS CULTURES LIKE IN RELATIVE PLUMPNESS FERSIS THINNESS A BUT THINGS LIKE CLEAR SKIN CLEAR EYES SYMMETRICAL FEATURES A I A LOW WASTO HYPORATIO A A FULL LIPS A LUSTROUS HAIR ALL THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT ARE A ASOCIATED WITH YOUTH IN HEALTH AND HENCE HAVE HAVE EVOLVE TO BE PART OF OUR STANDARDS OF ATTRACTIVENESS AND SO AND SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT MEN AR THESE A SUPERFICIAL CREATURES WHO YOU VALUE AT WOMEN ON THE BASIS OF APPEARANCE THER THERE IS AN UNDERLYING LOGIC TO WHY THEY DO SO A AND AS I SAID RELATIVE YOUTH THIS THIS AGE THING IS ONE OF THE LARGEST SEX DIFFERENCES YOU FINE IN LONK FROM MATE SELECTION WITH WOMEN PREFERRING SOMEWHAT OLDER MEN AND MEN PREFERRING SOMEWHAT YOUNGER WOMEN IS THEVER CONSISTINT AGE GAP A THROUG A TO RELATE TO THAT STATEMENT YES THERE IS A SO THE AGE GAP THOUGH DEPENDS ON THE AGE OF THE MAN SO A SO WE CAN DOCUMENT THIS SO IN MY STUDIES WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT MEN PREFERRED WOMEN WHO ARE ABOUT THREE TO FOUR YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEY WERE ON AVERAGE I I'LL QUALIFY THATS IN SECOND WOMEN PREFERRED GUISES WHO ARE ABOUT THREE AND A HALF THE FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OLDER THEN THEN THEY WERE SO THERE IS A SEX DIFFERENS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION A BUT AS MEN GET OLDER THEY PREFER WOMEN WHO ARE INCREASINGLY YOUNGER THAN THEY ARE SO ONE WAY TO GAGES SO THERE THERE ACTUAL MARRIAGE STATISTICS A AND THEN THERE ARE EXPRESS PREFERENCES AND BOTH SEXES KIND OF CONVERGE SO IF YOU LOOK AT A YOU KNW FIRST MARRIAGE SECOND MARRIAGE THIRD MARRIAGES IF PEOPLE GET DIVORCED TAN REMARRIED AVERAGE AGE GAP IS A IN AMERICA ANYWAYIS THREE YEARS AT FIRST MARRIAGE WITH THE GUIDES BEING OLDER A FIVE YEARS SECOND MARRIAGE AND EIGHT YEARS A THIRD MARRIAGE A A SO THAT IS AS MEN ARE GETTING OLDER AND GETTING DIVORCEON REMARRYING THAT THEY ARE MARRYING WOMN WHO ARE NCREASINGLY YOUNGER THAN THEY ARE A IN TERMS OF PREFERENCES IT'S ALSO EXPRESSED IN PREFERENCES SO IT DOESN'T GO DOWN SO SO LIKE A SAY AT TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN WOULDN SAY PREFER A WOMEN WHOIS TWENTY OR IN E EARLY TWENTIES THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN MIGHT PREFER WOMEN WHO'S IN ER LATE TWENTIES OR EARLY THIRTIES A FIFTY YEAR OLD MAN MIGHT PREFER WOMEN WHO SAY THIRTY FIVE TO THIRTY EIGHT SO SO THAT THE PREFERENCES DO GO UP BUT THE GAP GETS INCREAS IN THE LARGER AND THE REASON THAT YYOU DON'T SEE THINGS LIKE A WHY AREN'T MEN PREFERRING WOMEN SO PIQUE FERTILITY IN HUMANS IS AROUND AGE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE A AND SO SAY WHY AREN'T THE SIXTY YEAR OLD MEN PRIORATIZING TWENTY FIVE OR OLD WOMEN WELL AS I MENTION WE HAVE IT'S A RECIPROCAL MUTUAL MATE CHOICE PHENOMENON SHOCENSTRAINS THE OCCASION IS  WELL SHE SHE CONSTRAINS IT BUT ALSO MARRIAGE AND LONG TERMATING ARE A THINGS OTHER THAN REPRODUCTIVE UNIONS IN THE MODERN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS THERE A YOU KNOW W WE YOUSPOSED TO DO THINGS AS A COUPLLD AND IF YOU GET TOO LARGE IN AGE GAP THEN ESSENTIALLY YOURE INDIFFERENT CULTURES IN A YEU YOU KNOW YOU GROW UP WITH DIFFERENT SONGS AND AND AND AND IF THE CULTURAL GAP GETS TWO LARGE YOU YOUNGERSTAND EACH OTHER  SO SAID SO THER CONSTRAINTS ON THAT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CONTECTS WHERE THERE ARE NO CONSTRAINTS OF THAT SORT SO HISTORICALLY KINGS EMPERERS DES BUTS A ETCETER AND I'LL GIVE ONE MORE MODERN EXAMPLE A THEY BASICALLY PREFER YOUNG FERTILE ATTRACT IT FEMALES AND IF THEY HAVE HARAMS THEY STOCK THE HAREMS WITH THOSE S AN THEN CIRCULATE THEM OUT WHEN THEIR THIRTY AND SO FORTH AND SO SO IF YOU LOOK AT AT MARRY SYSTEMS THAT ARE UNCONSTRAINED A THEN THE PREFERENCES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE REVEALED OR WITHIN CULTURES THAT IS IF YOU LOOK AT MEN WHO WERE IN A POSITION TO GET WHAT THEY WANT SO AS MAC JAGGER NO TED YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT BUT OTRIS SOMETIMES A YEU WHICD YOU NEED I HEAR THAT AT MOST TE TIME HE GOT WHAT HE NEEDED RIGHT RIGHT YU GOT WHAT HE WANTED RIGHT AAND MAY BE WHAT HE NEEDED BUT HE HE WAS IN A POSITION I DON'T IF HE STILL EASYTHINGS IN HIS SEVENTIES NOW BUT HE WAS IN A POSITION AS WAS A LET'S A ROD STEART TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OR LEANORDER TE CAPRIA IF YOU WERE A MALE WHOSE IN A POSITION WHERE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO YOU AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PICK THEN YOU SEE THAT CLEAR EXPRESSION FOR YOUNGER FEMALES A THERE IS A CHART THAT WAS FLOATING AROUND THE INNE AND AT OF THE THE GIRL FRIENDS OF LEONA LEONARTER DE CAPIO AS HE GOT OLDER NAS HE'S GETTING OLDER AND OLD OR AND THE GRAPH OF THE AGE THE HIS GIRL FRIENDS IT BASICALLY STAYED THE SAME WAS IN THE EARLY EARLY TWENTIES OR SO HE VALUES CONSISTENCY HE HIS CONSISTENCY A BUT ON SO ASAY TO ANY ITTHE DAY TO CONVERGE ON THAT SO THESE ARE UNIVERSAL SEX DIFFERENCES IN A LONG TURM MATE SELECTION SO NOW WHEN WE SHIFT TO AND I SHOULD MENTION CULTURAL VARIABILITY  BECAUSE THAT'S A CRITICAL THINK CAUSE THERE IS IN MY THIRTY SEVEN CULTURE STUDY WHAT I FOUND WAS THE PREFERENCE FOR VIRGINITY THAT IS NO PRIOR SEXUAL EXPERIENCE THAT WAS THEMO SEVERIABLE A DESIRE OF CROSS CULTURES SO YOU HAD CULTURES LIKE ON AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY CHINA A IT WAS BASICALLY INDISPENSABLE THAT A PARTNER BE A VERGIN AND THEN AT THE OTHER END YOU HAVE SWEDEN WHERE SWEDEN SWEDES TYPICALLY PLACE CLOSE TO ZERO VALUE ON  SOME YOV FIND IT UNDESIRABLE LIKE YOUR WEIRD IF YOURE A VIRGIN AND SO YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE SPECTRUM THIS IS A VIRGINITY IN THE FEMALE OR IS THIS ALSO TAS NOT N WHEN CHINA WAS IT PREFERENCE AT THE MALE AND THE FEMALE B A YOUR MUTUAL MAKES A SELECTION YET IT WAS A PREFERENCE FOR BOTH SEXES O BUT TIT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE WHERE THERE WAS A SEX DIFFERENCE IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE DIRECTION OF MALES PREFERRING VIRGINITY MORE THAN FEMALES AND WE'VE GONE BACK TO CHINAS I STILL TO RESEARCH IN CHINA AMONG OTHER PLACES AND WEV GONE BACK AND RETESTED MODERN URBAN POPULATIONS IN THE IMPORTANCE OF VIRGINITY HAS GONE DOWN IN CHINA SPECIALLY IN THE URBAN AREAS AND THE SEX DIFFERENCE THAT DID T EXIST BEFORE HAS NOW EMERGED WHERE MALES TVALUE OT MORE THAN FEALES AND I THINK PART OF IT WAS IN PREVIOUS TIMES YOU U IT SEALING OF FACT YOU KNOW WHERE BOTH SEXES TAY YET IT'S ABSOLTLY IMPORTANT TO TO BE VERGION  SO SO THEIRE'S CULTURAL VARIATION AND CULTURAL CHANGE OVER TIME IN SOME OF THESE QUALITIES I ABUT THE SEX DIFFERENCES THAT I DESCRIBED HAVE REMAINED INVARIANT OVER THE YEARO SO SINCE MY THIRTY SEVEN CULTURE STUDY THESE BEEN REPLICATED IN IN AT LEAST A COUPLE OF DOZEN DIFFERENT CULTURES AND A AND WE'VE GONE BACK TO SOME OF THE CULTURE SO I MENTION HAVE GONE BACK TO CHINA A A BRAZIL AND INDIA A TO LOOK AT CULTURAL CHANGES OVER TIME AND AND THERE HAVE BEEN YOU NESS IN SOME CASES DRAMATI CULTURAL CHANGES OVER TIME BUT THE SEX DIFFERENCES THAT I DESCRIBED ARE INVARIANT THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT I BE REMISSIF I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT A TRUTH TELLING AND DECEPTION BECAUSE SOME OF THE MEASURES THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AGE FOR INSTANCE OF ONE CAN POTENTUALLY LIE ABOUT RIGHT I AN GUESSING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT ON ONLINE PROFILE YUS WHAT NOT  FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE ALSO LIE ABOUT HEIGHT AND OTHER FEATURES ON UNLING PROFILES A BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MUCH HARDER TO LIVE RIGHT EVENTUALLY A THE TRUTH COMES OUT ABOUT IM SOME IF NOT ALL OF THESE THINGS SO IT IF YOU WOULD A COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT HOW MEN AND WOMEN A LEVERAGE DECEPTION VERST IS TRUTH TELLING AND COMMUNICATING SOME OF THE THINGS AROUND MATE CHOICE SELECTION YET WELL SO BASICALLY THE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN DO DECEIVE ON O WE HAVE A THE MODERN CULTURAL IMENTION OF ONLINE DATING WHICH YOU KNOW WAS LITTLE USE TEN YEARS AGO AND VIRTUALLY ABSENT TWENTY YEARS AGO  AND PEOPLE DO LIE BUT THEY LIE IN PREDICTABLE WAYS THEY LIE IN WAYS THAT ATTEMPT TO EMBODY THE MAKE PREFERENCES OF THE PERSON THEY ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT AND SO MEN DO LIE THEY DECEIVE ABOUT THEIR INCOME THEIR STATUS TO THEY EXAGGERATE THEIR INCOME BY ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT A THEY THEY ARE THEY ADD THEY TACK ON ABOUT TWO INCHES TO THEIR HEIGHT OF THEIR FIVE TEND THEY ROUND UP TO SIX FEET A SO THEY DON'T LIKE IF THEIR FIVE TEN THEY DON'T SAY THAT THEIR GIGANTIC BUT THEY THINK CON OF ROUNDED UP IN THE MORE DESIRABLE DIRECTION A WOMEN TEND TO DECEIVE ABOUT WEIGHT SO THEY TEND TO SHAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN POUNDS OFF OF THEIR REPORTED WEIGHT AND BOTH SEXES POSTPHOTOS THAT ARE NOT TRULY REPRESENTATIVE WHAT THEY ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE SO THEY MIGHT POSTPHOTOS OF A THEMSELVES WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGOR ORE THER EVEN ADVICE A A TIPS ON HOW TO CREATE THE BEST SELFFY OF THE BEST ANGLE THAT WILL MAXIMALLY YOU KNOW AND HANCE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE OR TO ORDER JUST DOCTRINE OF F ODOS OT GUESSING R A I ARE BUT A SHY ING ABSOLUTELY AND AND IN ONE OF THE THINGS A AABOUT IT NOW YOU SAY LIKE WILL DO PEOPLE FIND OUT OF COURSE PEOPLE PEOPLE DO FIND OUT I MEAN I GIVE YOU ONE STORY ABOUT A COLLEAGUE OF MIND WHO AS DOING IS E MALE WHOS DOING IN AN ET DATING AND CE PICKED ONLY WOMEN WHO SELF DESCRIBED AS SEVENS ON THE ONE TO SEVEN ON ATTRACTIVNE O THE MOST ATTRACTIVE SO AS SELF REPORTED AND SO AND TO WIN OUT WITH ONE WOMEN AND SHE WAS MISSING HER FRONT TEETH AND HE HE SAID WILL CALL ME PICKY BUT MISSING  FRONT TEETH AND SHE THINKS SHE'S LIKE HE TOLEBADRAGGORS HE WAS A LITTLE A  DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT AND WOMEN OF COURSE ARE DISAPPOINTED THEY THEY MEET A GUY WHO THEY THINK IS THIS PHYSICALLY FIT YOU KNOW ATHLETIC GUY IN HE COMES UP IS IN A THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND OVERWEIGHT A SO PEOPLE PEOPLE DO FIND OUT AND AND SO AND THERE ARE SOME IN ANET DATING SIGHTS HAVE A KIND OF A VETTING OF THE ACCURACY OF A SOMETHING SO SOMETHINGS YOU CAN LOOK UP THOUGH PUBLIC RECORDS AND TOS TISK I HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR EXAMPLE  I SE ISI ON A IN A A SEXUAL A OFFENDERS A THE WEBSIDE A SO SO THERE' SOMETHINGS YOU CAN VERIFY BUT WHAT I TELL PEOPLE IS OU REALLY HAVE TO MEET THE PERSON IN INNER ACT YUOW BECAUSE IT BEBEIMPART BECAUSE OF THE DISCEPTION BUT ALSO BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS WITHIN ERNET DATING IS THAT THE PHIS THE PHOTOGRAPH TENDE TO OVERWHELM ALL THE OTHER CUSE AND ALL THE OTHER CUESE ARE WRITTEN STATEMENTS AND WE WAREN'T RELIEVE EVOLVED TO PROCESS WRITTEN STATEMENTS A BUT WE WERE REVOLVE TO RESPOND TO PHYSICAL CUSE BUT A AND MEN TEND TO ATTEND TO THE VISUAL CCUSE MUCH MORE THAN WOMEN SO WOMEN IN THEIR MATE SELECTION THEY HAVE OLD FACTORY CUSE TO WHAT IS THE GUY SOUND LIKE IS VOCAL QUALITIES A A A THAT'S A AUDITORY CUS A BUT ALL FACTORY CUSE WHAT IS THE SMELL LIKE AND SO WOMEN HAVEN'T MORE ACUTE SENSE OF SMELL THAN MEN DO AND O AND SO IF THE GUD OESN'T SMELL RIGHT EVEN IF HE EMBODIES ALL TH OTHER QUALITIES WOMEN WANT THAT TO DEAL BREAKER  AND AND SO I CURGE PEOPLE JUST YOU KNOW STOP WITH THE HUNDRED TACBACK AN FORTH OR MESSAGING AND MEET A PERSON FOR COPLI COFFEE AND INTER ACT AND THEN YOU'LL YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET A MORE ACCURATE BEAT ON THE PERSON AND THEN OF COURSE SOME QUALITIES YOU CAN'T DISSESS EVEN WITH A WITH A HALF HOUR INTER ACTION YOU COAN TELL A LOT BUT THINGS LIKE EMOTIONAL STABILITY ARE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE ASSES OVER TIME AND SO ONE OF THINGS THAT I ADVISE PEOPLE TO DO AND ANOT THE ADVICEGIPING BUSINESS BUT PEOPLE ASKING A WHAT DO I FIND OUT WHAT I STUDY THEY SA I GO THIS PROBLEM CAN YOU GIVE ME ADVISE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS TO ASSESS THINGS LIKE EMOTIONAL STABILITY WHICH IS ABSOLY CRITICAL AND LONG TERM MATING  IS TO DO SOMETHING LIKE GO ON A TRIP TOGETHER TAKE TAKE A VACATION AND WERE YOUR EVEN IN A UNFAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT WERE YOUR YOU HAVE TO HOPE WITH THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IN A AS OPPOSED TO A IN ENVIRONMENT WERE IT'S VERY PREDICTABLE AND AND SO U U GET A GREATER EXPOSURE BECAUSE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE HALL MARKS OF EMOTIONAL INSTABILITY IS  HOW THEY RESPOND DISTRESS SO EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE A LONG LATENCY TO RETURN DE BASE LINE AFTER A STRESSFUL EVEN AND SO THIS IS THE SORT OF INFORMATION YOU CAN'T GET ON A COFFEE DATE AND IW YOU CAN ONLY GET BY ASCESSING IT OVER TIME UT SOMEBODY WHOSE LABORATORY STUDY STRESS AND TOOLS TO COMBAT STRESS I A THAT'S GREAT IT'S YET MORE INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO DEVELOP A SELF REGULATORY MECHANISM A FOR THEMSELVES A I'M GUESSING MANY OF THE A FEATURES OF DECEPTION IN THIS CONTECT A WERE PRESENT LONG BEFORE INTERNAT DATING A AND SO IS IT IT'S SOMEWHAT DARK TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS A IS DECEPTION BUILT IN TO THIS DANCE THAT WE CALL MATE SELECTION AND HAS IT BEEN BUILT IN FOR A LONG TIME OR THIS A WERE'S A SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK IS EMERGED MORE AS PEOPLE I ARE APPROACHING EACH OTHER THROUGH THESE ELECTRONIC A YHE BASE MEDIUM YE I MEAN SOME FORMS OF DECEPTION HAVE BEEN THERE A FOR A LONG TIME OVER HUMAN AVE WE SHORING HISTORY SO ONE FORM OF DECEPTION WHICH WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED IS DECEPTION ABOUT WHETHER YOUR INTERESTED IN A LONG TERM COMMIT A RELATISHIP OR A SHORT FROM HOOK UP AND SO THERE'S DECEPTION ABOUT THAT ESPECIALLY ON THE PART OF MEN SO MEN WHO ARE INTERESO LIKE ON TENDER  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED OF THE TENDER DENIES THIS 'S BEEN REPORTED THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY PERCENT OF THE MEN ON TENDER OR EITHER MARRIED OR IN LONG TERM COMMITTED RELATISHIPS AN THEIR LING FOR SOMETHING ON THE SIDE BUT A THE A IN TERMS OF SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING A MATE THE OVERDISPLAY THAT HEY I'M INTERESTED IN JUST A SHORT TERM HOOK I HUNDERSTON SEXS IL MONT HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW I LEST JUST GO BACK TO MY APARTMENT THESE ARE VERY INEFFECTIVE TACTICS AND SO EFFECTIVE TACTICS FOR MEN AR OFTEN DISPLAYING CUSE TO LONG TERM INTEREST AND SO AND OF COURSE THAT'S EFFECTIVE FOR A WOMAN WHOS SEEKING ALONG TERM INTEREST IAND SO AND SO THAT'S OF DECEPTION SO WE FIND IN OUR STUDIES OF DECEPTION THAT MEN TEND TO EXAGGERATE THE DEPTHS OF THEIR FEELINGS FOR A WOMAN I EXAGGERATE HOW SIMILAR THEY ARE AND HOW A LING THEY ARE IN THEIR VALUES AND RELIGIOUS ORIENTATIONS AND POLITICAL VALUES AN SO FORTH AND SO AND SO I THINK THERE'S DECEPTION AROUND THAT AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY IN EVOLUTIONARILY A RECURRENT FORM OF DECEPTION THAT WOMEN HAVE DEFENCES AGAINST BY THE WAY BUT I THINK THAT MODERN INTERNETDATING OPENS THE DOOR FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DECEPTION THAT IT WERE AT AMINTIMUM WERE DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH ANCESTRALLY SO LIKE THINGS LIKE PHOTO SHOPPING  YOU KNOW  YOU WASN'T AVAILABLE BACK THEN A PLUS WE EVOLVED IN THE CONTEXT OF SMALL GROUP LIVING WERE YOU NOT ONLY HAD YOUR OWN PERSONAL OBSERMATIONS OF SOME ONE'S QUALITIES YOU HAD ALSO YOUR YOUR RELATIVES YOUR FRIENDS ALLIES THE SOCIAL REPUTATION THAT SOME ONE HAD THIS IS THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT ARE LESS AVAILABLE IN MODERN ENVIRONMENTS BECAUSE IN A PEOPLE MIGRATE THEY MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE ON I THEY CAN CLOSE DOWN ONE INTER NAT PROFILE AND PUT UP ANOTHER OR THEY COULD HAVE SIX GOING SIMULTANEOUSLY SO THERE SO THE MODERN FERNMENT OPENS UP THE DOOR FOR FORMS OF DECEPTION THAT WEREN'T AVAILABLE OR WAREN'T AVAILABLE TO THE SAME DEGREE ANCESTRALLY I SEE A VERY INTERESTING A WOULD YOU I TOUCH ON SOME OF THE THE FEATURES THAT A ARE SELECTED FOR INTERS OF A SEC SEXUAL PARTNER CHOICE A ETOCTUAL OBIT ABOUT A MAKE CHOICE BUT A IN TERMS OF SEXUAL PARTNER CHOICE ARE THE IS ARE THERE ANY GOOD STUDIES EXPLORING WHAT PEOPLE ARE SELECTING FOR OR IS IT A THAT THEY ARE BOTH JUST IN A STATE OF OF A PURE HYPOTHILAMIC DRNERSIDE TIST AFTER ALL AND A AND THEREFORE IT'S HARD TO RECREATE IN THE LABORATORY O NO NO WE WE DO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE PREFERENCE OF FOR A SEX PARTNER DIFFER FROM PREFERENCE FOR LONG TERMATE ATHERE IS OVERLOP OF COURSE BUT AONE THING IS ON PHYSICAL APPEARANCE SO PHYSICAL APPEARANCE FOR WOMEN IS IMPORTANT AND LONG TERMATING NOT AS IMPORTANT IS FORMEN BUT IT BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT IN SHORT TERMATING AND SO IIS THE GU GOOD LOOKING ASO THOS PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN A THEY ARE THEY REMAIN IMPORTANT FORMEN PHYSICAL APPEARANCE IN SHORT FORMATING BUT WITH THE FOOTNOTE THAT MEN ARE WILLING TO DROP THEIR STANDARDS IN SHORT TERMATING A IF ITS LOW COMMITMENT LOW RISK A JUST SEX ON YOU KNOW WITHOUT ENTANGLING COMMITMENTS A WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO PRIORATIES ON WHAT I CALL A BAD BOY QUALITIES SO GUYSE WHO ARE VERY SELF CONFIDENT A GUYSE WHO ARE A A STRAT GUYSE WHO ARE A LITTLE ARROGANT GUSE WHO E RISK TAKING GUYSE WHO A DEFY CONVENTIONS  WOMEN ARE MORE ATTRACTED TO THOSE GUYES IN SHORT TERM MATING THAN LONG TERMATING A AND WHERE IS A LONGTERMATING THEY GO MORE FOR THE GOOD DAD QUALITIES IS THI GUY DEPENDABLE WAS HE GING TO BE A GOOD FATHER TO MY CHILDREN A AND THEN ALSO  IN SHORT TERM MATING WOMEN USE THAT MATE COPYING A A HURISTIC THAT IS A IF THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER WOMEN WHO FIND HIM ATTRACTIVE WOMEN FINE HIM ATTRACTIVE AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE THE GROUPYN PHENOMENONS OSO WITH THE ROCK STARS FOR EXAMPLE THEYE ARE THOUSANDS OF SCREAMING WOMEN ALL OF WHOM ON ASLEEP WITH THIS A FAMOUS ROCK STAR AND THEY USED THAT IS INFORMATION THEY FIND IF YOU TOOK LIKE A STILL PHOTO OF SOME OF THESE ROCK STARS AND ASKED WOMEN HOW ATTRACTIVE THE GUY IS VERSES TELLIME'S A FAMOUS ROCK STAR AND SHOWED THE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN SCREAMING A ATA THAT THEY JUDGE HIM ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY TERMS OF HIS A ATTRACTIVENESS A SO S OR EVEN THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT WOMEN'S ATTRACTION TO MEN IS MORE CONTEXT SPECIFIC AND VERYES MORE CROSS CONTEXTS THAN MEN'S ATTRACTION TO WOMEN AND SA  GAVE YOU JUST AN EXAMPLE THAT THIS IS A A FEMALE COLIGUE OF MY WENT TO A CONFERENCE AN ACADEMIC CONFERENCE AND SHE FOUND THE ORGANIZER OF THIS CONFERENCE TO BE REALLY ATTRACTIVE N AND AND THEN SAW HIM SIX MONTHS LATER AND WONDER WHAT WHAT WAS I THINKING I ISN'T HE VERY ATTRACTIVE AT ALL AND WHAT IT WAS IS WHEN HE WAS THE ORGANIZER HE WAS AT THE CENTER OF THE ATTENTION STRUCTURE YOU NOW HE HE WAS THE GUY UP ON STAGE DIRECTING EVERYBODY AND EVERYONE WAS ATTENDING TO HIM AND THEN WHEN HE WAS JUST A NORMAL PRESENTERATOF CONFERENCE A HE WASN'T DIDN'T COMMAND THE ATTENTION STRUCTURE LIKE HE DID IN THAT WHEN HE WAS THE ORGANIZER AND SO THIS IS JUST AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW A CIRCUMSTANCE DEPENDENT WOMEN'S ATTRACT MADE ATTRACTION IS FOR GUYSE IT DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW HIS HIS STATUS THE NUMBER OF A WOMEN THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO E A THE ATTENTION STRUCTURE IS SEE HOW HOW HE INTERACTS WITH A PUPPY OR OR A BABY IF HE IS IGNORING A BABY IN DISTRESS OR POSITIVELY INTERACTING WITH A YOUNG CHILD A A ALL THESE THINGS WET WORSE FOR MEN IT ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER YAU HAVE CONTEXTIS MORE IRRELEMENT THERE HUNTING IN ON THE SPECIFIC CYCLOPHYSICAL CUSE THAT THE WOMEN IS DISPLAYING IN CONTECTS BE DAMNED VERY INTERESTING A STUCK ABOUT INFIDELITY A INCOMMITTEED RELATIONSHIPS A WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CONSISTENT A FINDINGS AROUND A REASONS FOR AND MAYBEVEN A LONGTROM CONSEQUENCES OF INFIDELITY FOR MEN AND WOMEN NTHIS COAN BE MARRIAGE OR OR LUNGTRM PARTNERSHIP OR YOU INFIDELITY OF ANY KIND I SUPPOSE YE SO WELL LIS THING IT DOES HAPPEN YEYEYEWELL WLL THAT HOW FREQUENT IS YET THATS THAT'S THE INTERESTING TING WELL WELL HOW FREQUENT IT IS IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE BECAUSE O IT'S THE THE ONE OF THE FORMS OF HUMAN CONDUCT THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO KEEP SECRET SO SO THE IF YOU GO BACK A NOW SAY SEVENTY YEARS TO THE CLASS I KINSIY STUDIES THE QUESTIONS BEN INFIDELITY WERE THE QUESTIONS THAT MOST PEOPLE REFUSED TO ANSWER AND WHEN THE QUESTION WAS BROUGHT UP CAUSE MORE PEOPLE TO DROP OUT OF THE STUDY AND SO THAT KIND OF TELLS YOU SOMETHING THAT WHAT WHAT A PEOPLE CONCEAL IN A INFIDELITY INSEST MURDER YE THERE'S A SMALL HANDFUL THINGS OF PEOPLE UNIVERSALLY ONE TO CONCEAL AN INFIDELITY IS ONE OF THEM ASO BUT PEOPLE DO IT AND SO KINSY ESTIMATED TWENTY SIX PER CENT OF MARRIED WOMEN COMMITTED AN AN INFIDELITY T SOME POINT ERIN THEIR MARRIAGE AND ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF MEN OTHER STUDIES HAVE GIVEN LOWER FIGURES AND SO THAT THE EXACT FIGURES BOUND SUROUND DEPENDING ON IU A AN AN EMITY PROVIDED AND HOW COMFORTABLE THEY ARE WITH THE INTER VIEWER AND SO FORTH BUT AND BY INFIDELITY AS IVING INTERCOURSE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE YOT SO WERE NOT TIKING ABOUT AND QUATINGCA EMOTIONAL AFFAIRS R TALKING ABOUT THIS WERE JUST SEX SEX WITH SOMEBODY OTHERS THAN THEIR COMMITTEED PARTNER YES UNBEKNONTS TO THEIR PART RIGHT RIGHT AND THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF INFIDELITY WHICH WE COULD GET INTO INCLUDING EMOTIONAL INFIDELITY AND FINANCIAL INFIDELITY BUT HERE RE JUSTIING ABOUT FOR THE MOMENT SEXUAL INFIDELITY AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT SEXUAL INFIDELITY IS THAT THE SEX IS REALLY DIFFER FUNDAMENTALLY IN THE MOTIVES FOR COMMITTING INFIDELITY SO FOR MEN ON THE PRIMARY MOTIVE AND THAT THESE ARE ON AVERAGE SEX DIFFERENCE SO WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT SECON A OINTAMET ON AVERAGE SEX DIFFERENCES CAS THERE'S OVERLAPPING THE DISTRIBUTIONS AND AND A BUT SO THESE ARE GENERALIZATIONS OF WHICH THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS SO OF SO FOR MEN IT'S IT'S MAINLY A MATTER OF SEXUAL VARIETY SO ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE MEN IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY PRERSENTED ITSELF I WAS OUT OF TOWN  I HAD THIS OPPORTUNITY SO LOW RISK LOW COST A PURSUIT OF SEXUAL VARIETY SEXUAL MOVELTY IS A KEE MOTIVATION FOR MEN SIGHT INTERRUPTED IS WO  SO SEVENTY PER CENT OF MEN THAT CHEAT THAT'S  A A PRIMARY TO A CAUSE OR IS IT THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF MEN DO CHEAT NO NOOSEVENTY OF THE MEN WHO CHEATS SEVENTY PER CENT THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION OF THE MEN WHO DU CHEAT SEVENTY PER SENT SIGHT THAT AS THE KEY MOTIVE A THE KEY REASON WHY THEY COMMITTED AN INFIDELIT OR LIKE WI METAN CLIMBERS CLIMBOUTANS CAUSE THEY'RE THERE REBECAUSE THERE THERE IF THEY WELL OU OW THE COMMEDIAN I THINK IT WAS CRISS ROCKS THAT MEN ARE ONLY AS FAITHFUL AS THEIR OPPORTUNITY A AND OR OR HOW AN HOW AVAILABLE THEIR PASSWORD ON THEIR PHONAS TO THEIR PARDNER RIGHT RIGHT YET SO BUT AND THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION BUT A A BUT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WOMEN A THIS JUST DESIRE FOR PURE NOVELTY SEXUAL VARIETY IS MUCH LESS OF A MOTIVE  BUT WOMEN WHO HAVE AFFAIRS SIGHT THAT THEIRE UNHAPPY WITH THEIR PRIMEAR RELATIONSHIP EMOTIONALLY UNHAPPY ERE SEXUALLY UNHAPPY AND TYPICALLY BOTH AND THIS MAY SEEM LIKE TOTALLY OBVIOUS THAT WELL OF COURSE PEOPLE IF ARE UNHAPPY IN THE RELATISHIP ARE MORE LIKELY TO STRAY BUT IN FACT IT'S NOT TRUE FOR MEN SO F YOU COMPARE MEN WHO ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR MARRIAGE AND MEN WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR MARRIAGE THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE IN THEIR INFIDELITY RATES I THINK IT GOES IT DOWN TO THAT ISSUE OF A YOU KNOWIS MOTIVE FOR SEEKING VARIETY SO NOW WHY DO WOMEN DO IT A BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A RISKY ENDEAVOUR SHE RISKS FOR LONG TERM MATE OR LOSING LONG TERMMATE IT'S RISKIAN TERMS OF REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FOR BOTH SEXES A SO IT'S A RISKEEPING WHY DO WOMEN DO IT A AND THERE TOO COMPETING HYPOTHESES  AT LEAST TOO BUT THEIRE TWO PRIMARY COMPETING HYPOTHESES IN THE EVOLUTIONARY LITERATURE ONE IS CALLED A DUEL MATING STRATEGY HYPOTHESIS WE ARE WOMEN AR SEEKING TO GET RESOURCES IN INVESTMENT FROM ONE GUY AND GOOD GENES FROM ANOTHER GUY SO IN PRINCE AN IMPRINCIPLE THAT THAT CAN THAT CAN WORK AND I INITIALLY THIS IS A WASN'T HYPOTHES ORIGINAL WITH ME THISS OF STEEP GANG INSTEAD RANDYTHORNHENE SOME OTHERS OF A MIRTY HAZELTON A FORMER STOOD N MIND HAVE ADVOCATED THIS DUEL MATING STRATEGY HYPOTHESIS AN ORIGINALLY I WAS A IN INDORSED IT BECAUSE THE DT A SEEM TO SUPPORT IT WE CAN GET INTO WHICH ADATA SEEM TO SUPPRT IT BUT OVERTIME I BECAME MORE AND MORE DUBIOUS ABOUT THIS HYPOTHESIS AND INSTEAD HAVE ADVOCATED WHAT I CALL THE MATE SWITCHING HYPOTHESIS AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT A A WHOLE HOST OF INFORMATION AROUND WHY WOMEN HAVE AFFAIRS IT'S NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE DUEL MATING STRATEGY HYPOTHESIS SO AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE MATE SWITCHING THAT IS WOMEN WHO ARE LOOKING TO A EITHER DIVEST THEMSELVES FROM AN EXISTING MATESHIP A OR A TRATE UP IN THE MATING MARKET TO A MATE WHOSE MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THEM WORE HIGHER AND MATE VALUE OR SIMPLY SEE WHETHER THEIR SUFFICIENTLY DESIRABLE SO THAT IT EASES THE TRANSITION INTO THE MATING POOL OR KEEP KEEPING AND MATE IS A POTENTIAL BACK UP MATE WITH A CAL MATE INSURANCE I SHOULD HAVE CAR INSURANCE OF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO YOUR CAR HOSEHOUSI HOUSE INSURANCE WE ALSO HAVE MADE INSURANCE HE O KEEPING SOME WHEN ONE WOMEN SAID THE MEN ARE LIKE SOUP YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE ONE ON THE BACK BURNER SO A INTEREST WHETHER THAT IT'S THE BEST O ANOW YOU NOT ON MATURE BUT A BUT AT CONVE CAPTURES SOMETHING ABOUT ABOUT WHY SO SO WELL WHAT EVIDENCE AN I TALK ABOUT WELL FOR ONE THING WOMEN WHO HAVE AFFAIRSN HESS IS ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT OF THEM THEY LETY AGAINST AR JUST A ONE ATO  E OEN O EV TO HAVE O OTHE WOMEN WHO HAVE AFFAIR SO LET'S SAY BALL PARTKINZII WAS LET SAY ROUGHLY RIGHT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX PER CENT OF WOMEN WILL HAVE AFFAIRS LET JUST ASSUME THAT HE IS RIGHT AND WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY A BUT OF THE WOMEN WHO DO HAVE AFFAIRS ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT SAY THEY HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THEIR AFFAIR PARTNER THEY BECOME DEEPLY EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED WITH THEIR AFFAIR FOR PARTNER A AND TO ME IF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET GOOD JEEDS FROM A GUY THAT IS THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS FALL IN LOVE WITH THEM OR GET EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED BUT IT'S VERY COMPATIBLE IF YOU WANT A SWITCH MATES A AND SO THE A SO THAT SORT OF THAT'S US ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THAT WOMEN A THAT THE MATE WITCHING FUNCTION OF INFIDELITY IS A MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION THAT THESE TWO ERE NOT INHERENTLY INCOMPATIBLE HYPOTHESES ANOTHERS AT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOME WOMEN DO PURSUE A DUEL MADTING STRATEGY HYPOTHESIS A BUT THERE'S OTHER EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHATER THE ACTUAL RATES OF GEANETIC COCKLEDRY WELL IN THE MODERN ENVIRONMENT ANYWAY THERE PRETTY LOW TURNS OUT THER LIKE TWO TO THREE PER CENT COULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN FOR THE AUDIENCE WHITH GENETIC COCLE SOSO THIS IS WHERE WERE THE WOMEN WERE WERE THE MAN BELIEVES HE IS THE GENETIC FATHER OF A CHILD BUT IT TURNS OUT HE'S NOT MIGHT BE THE MALE MANNOR OF THE NEXT OR NABLE OF THE GUY SHE'S HAVING INTERFERE WITH SO A A ME MISTAKIN PATERNITY  AND GENETTIC COCKLEDRY IS JUST ONE WAY TO A CAPTURE AND AFTER THE CUNCOO BIRD RIGHT NAMED AFTER THE COKOO BIR YES WHO SNEAKS ITS EGGS INTO THE NEST OF THE OTHER ROLLS DESTROYS THE THE FUTURE OFFSPRING OF THE RIGHT BIRD AND THEN BUSILY AWFUL OADS ALL THE WORK ON TO ANOTHER RIGHT FATHER PARISATIZS YA THE PRENELEN VESTMEN OF A A DIFFERENT BIRD SPECIES SO A SI SO ANYWAY SO I THINK THAT AND THERE'S OTHER SOURCES OF EVIDENCE THAT I THINK POINT OSO ONE OF THER SOURCES OF EVIDENCE THAT INITIALLY SEEM TO SUPPORT THE DUELMATING STRATEGY HYPOTHESIS WAS OBULATION SHIPS SO INOTHER WORDS ON IT LOOKD LIKE FROM THE EARLY STUDIES THAT WEN WOMEN ARE OVULATINGS ARE AMONG NON PIL TAKING WOMEN NON WOMEN NOTON HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES THAT THEY EXPERIENCED A PREFERENC SHIFT TOWARD MORE MEN WHO WERE MASCULINE AND SYMMETRICAL WHICH WERE HYPOTHESIZED MARKERS FOR GUGINES AND AND THERE'S AN EXPLANATION FOR THAT BUT IT TURNS OUT THE EFFECTS OF OBULATION ON WOMEN'S MADE PREFERENCES ARE FAR WEAKER THAN INITI THAN THE INITIAL STUDIES LOOKED LIKE AND IN FACT SOME LARGER SCALE STUDIES HAVE FAILED TO REPLICATE THEM ENTIRELY AND SO IT'S N THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY SOURCES EVIDENCE THESE OVULATIONSHIPS THAT WOMEN WERE GOING AFTER GUGINES BECAUSE IT'S ONLY WHEN SHE'S OBULATING AND SHE CAN GET PREGNANT BY HAVING SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN THAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR HER TO HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN AND THERE WAS EVEN SOME EARLY EVIDENCE THAT WOMEN WERE TIMING THEIR AFFAIRS A TIMING SEXS WITH THEIR AFFAIR PARTNERS TO COM INSIDE WITH WHEN THEY WERE OBULATING BUT BUT AS I SAID SOME OF THESE SUBSEQUENT STUDIES HAVE FAILED TO REPLICATE THESE EARLY FINDINGS CALLING INTO QUESTION THAT DUEMATING STRATEGY NOTION AND SO I THINK IVE I'VE SHIFTED MY VIEWS ON THIS IAN AND NOW ENDURESE N THE MADES WHICHING HYPOTHESIS AS A MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR WHY MOST WOMEN HAVE AFFAIRS THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THIS A MAKES ME WONDER IF WHEN OF THE WOMEN THAT HAVE AFFAIRS DO THOSE AFFAIRS TEND TO BE MORE LONG LASTING THAN THE AFFAIRS THAT MEN HAVE BECAUSE THE WAYYO DESCRIBE IT IS MEN ARE A SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE A CARPEDEUM TYPE APPROACH YOV INFIDELITY AND WOMEN POTENTIALLY ON AVERAGE ARE UNCAPITALIZING ON SOMETHING THAT IS LONGER TERM NOW OF COURSE IF THEY'RE DOING THIS AROUND OPULATION THAN IT WOULD CONSTRAIN THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THEY WOULD NEED TO SEE OR HAVE SEX WITH THETHE ON THIS OTHER PERSON THAT THE'RE NOT MARRIED TO WHAT A IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT WOMEN HAVE MORE ONGOING AFFAIRS IN MEN MEN HAVE TRAIND MORE TRANSI INTO YES YET THERE IS AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE AFFAIRS THERE'S A SEX DIFFERENCE THERE SO THAT WOMEN TEND TO HAVE AFFAIRS WITH ONE PERSON AND BECOME A MOTIONALLY INVOLVED WITH AT ONE PERSON OVER TIME MEN TEND TO WHO HAVE AFFAIRS TEND TO HAVE AFFAIRS WITH A LARGER NUMBER OF AFFAIR PARTNERS AND SO WHICH THAN BY DEFINITION CAN'T BE LONG AS YOU CAN HAVE LONG TERM AFFAIRS WITH SIX DIFFERENT PARTNER E UNLESS HE'S A JUGGLING MULTIPLE A FONE ACCOUNTS ORS ONRS A I  ARRIGHT AND SOME MEN TRY TO DO THAT BUT ON THIS TOU BE VERY TAXING YET ON AND IN THE STA N AGEIT'S O IT'S EASIER TO MEET MORE PEOPLE BY VIRTUE OF ON LINE COMMUNICATIONS BUT IT'S ALSO EASIER TO GET CAUGHT MEANING IT'S HARDER T CONSEAL A INTERACTIONS EVERYTHING'S IN THE CLOUD ANYWAY A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A FORMER VERY HIGH LEVEL IN SPECIAL OPERATIONS SAID ANYTHING THAT'S NOT IN YOUR HEAD AND ONLY IN YOUR HEAD IS AVAILABLE  OTHERS TO YE FINE SHOULD THEY WANT IT YEI THINK THAT'S AND I THINK THAT'S LARGELY TRUE AND AND YE SO O A AND FUN INFORMATION TEXT MESSAGES AND PEOPLE VERY GOOD HACKING INTO THEIR PARTNERS A FUNDS COMPUTERS AND THEN ALSO THEIR VIDIO CAMERS EVERYWHERE SO SO A SNEAKING OFF TO THIS  ACQUIET RESTAURANT I'M IN THEIR PROBABLY AIHT VIDIO CAMERS THAT AND RECORTED YOU WALKING IN AND OUT OF THAT RESTAURANT EVERYTHING CAN BE FOUND A I'M CERTAIN OF THAT YOU MENTION EMOTIONAL AFFAIRS AND FINANCIAL INFIDELITY IS WELL YE AM I  HAD A GROFER AND ONCE WHO A AS A EARLY DATE DISCUSSION A SAID A NOT THAT I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT A YOU ARE BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR SHE SAID THAT YOU ARE NOT EMOTIONALLY PHYSICALLY OR FINANCIALLY TIED TO ANY OTHER WOMEN I VERY INTERESTING THAT NOW YOU BRING UP A FINANCIAL IN FIDELITY SHE'S A QUITE HAPPILY PARTNER NOW AND A A NOT WITH ME BUT A  BUT IT'S INTERETING IS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD ANYONE SPELLET OUT THAT WAY IS A LIST ALMOST LIKE SPECIFIC AMES IND A GRANT AM A WHAT IS EMOTIONAL INFIDELITY WHAT IS FINANCIAL INFIDITYA WAS IS A VERY SMART WOMAN TITE AE  ATHERAT AND SI SO I SSEEMED YOU YOU WERE YOU GAVE HONEST RESPONSES TO ALL THOSE THREE QUESTIONS AS I RECALL IT AS WE NOW KNOW A THAT THER AWHAT YOU CAN ASK HER AT SOME POINT RI  I YOU ARE AND THERE'S SELF DECEPTION IN THE SERVICE OF DECEPTION THAT IS ANOTHER SHE SO EMOTIONAL AN FIDELITY IS BASICALLY  EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S IT'S FALLING IN LOVE WITH SOME ONE ELSE BECOMING PSYCHOLOGICALLY CLOSE TO SOMEONE ELSE SHARING INTIMATE A WERE PRIVATE INFORMATION WITH SOME ONE ELSE A THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY EMOTIONAL INFIDELITY AND OM ONE OF THE HALMARKS OF THIS O  STUDY DON BY A FORMER A STUDINTO MID VERY CULY IS VERY CLEVER I THOUGHT HE ANALYZE THA USED TO BE THIS REALITY TVESHO CALLED CHEATERS WHERE THEY WOULD HIRA DETECTIVES I AND THEY WOULD WHEN THE DETECTIVE WOULD LIKE TO FALLOW SOMEONE TO A HOTELRUM THEY CALL UP THE PARTNER AND I SAY A YOUR HUSBAND JUST WALKED INTO THE HOTELERUM A WITH SOME ONE ELSE DO YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME DOWN TO THE HOTEL AND CONFRONT EM AND CERTAIN PERCENGOF PEOPLE WOULD CONFRONT AND WHAT HE ANALYZED THAT HE ANALYZED ALL THESE EPISODES OF THIS SHO CALLED CHEATERS AND WHAT HE EXAMINED WAS THE VERBL INTERROGATIONS WHEN PEOPLE CONFRONTED THEIR PARTNERS AND WHEN MEN CONFRONT OF THEIR PARTNERS THE FIRST QUESTION THEY WANT NOW IS DID YOU FUCK HIM A WOMEN THEIR FIRST QUESTION WAS DO YOU LOVE HER AND SO THIS KIND OF C APTURES THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SEXUAL INFIDELITY AND EMOTINAL INFIDELIT AND ALSO KIND OF CAPTURES ANOTHER SEX DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL JEALOUSY YOU KNOW WHERE MEN TEND TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE SEXUAL COMPONENTS OF THE INFIDELITY BECAUSE THOSE ARE WHAT A COMPROMISE HIS PATERNITY CERTAINTY HIS CERTAINTY THAT HE'S ACTUAL ACTUALLY GENETIC FATHER OF WHATEVER A OFFSPRING ENSUE A WHEREIS A WHAT LOVE IS A CUE TO DO YOU LOVE HER THAT'S A CUE THAT HE'S GOING TO LEAVE YOU THE WOMEAN FOR ANOTHER WOMAN  IS A CUE THAT TO THE LONG TERM LOSS OF THAT INVESTMENT INCOMMITMENT FROM THAT PARTNER  AND SO AND SO THE SEXES SEEM TO DIFFER A IN WHICH O ASPECTS OF THE INFIDELITY WITH WOMEN WORE A TUNE TO MORE UPSET BY THE EMOTIONAL INFIDELITY MEN WORE BY THE SEXUAL INFIDELITY NOW FINANCIAL INFIDELITYES BEEN EXPLORED MUCH LESS BUT IN IN IN MY NEW BOOK A WHEN MEN BEHAVE BADLY I HAVE A SEXTION ON FINANCIAL NFIDELITY WERE I SUMRISE ALL THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE AND I WAS KIND OF FLABRAGASTED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO DO THINGS LIKE HAVE CREDIT CARDS THAT THEIR SPOUSE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT KEEP SECRET BANK ACCOUNTS HAVE THE CREDIC CARD BILLS MAIL TO THEIR OFFICE RATHER THAN THEIR HOME I HAVE A BASICALLY A RESOURCES AND EXPENDITURES OF POOLED RESOURCES THAT THEY KEEP FROM THEIR PARTNER AND BOTH SEXES DO IT A AND IN THE PERCENTAGES VERY  FROM STUDY TO STUDY BUT THEY RANGE FROM LIKE THIRTY TO SIXTY PER CENT OF ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE KEEPING FINANCIAL INFORMATION FROM THEIR FROM THEIR SPOUSE IN ONE WAY ANOTHER COULD BE THE WOMEN'S OUT BYING DESINER O PURSES OR DESINER HAND BAGS A COULD BE THE GUISE OUT A GOING TO STRIPT CLUBS OR TAKING HIS A FAIR PARTNER TO A RESTAURANTS AND DOESN'T WANT THOSE CHARGES TO SHOW UP ON YOU KNOW A A JOINT BEHELD CREDICRAT A SO FINANCIAL INFIDELITY'S CRITICAL  AND THEN EVEN THINGS LIKE DIVERTING POOLED RESOURCES TO ONE SET OF GENETIC RELATIVES VERSES ANNOTHER SAID IS ANOTHER THING THAT PEOPLE TEND TO KEEP SECRET SO THERE ARE FORMS OF FINANCIAL INFIDELITY   AS WELL SO YOT INFIDELITY YOUR ABSOLY IT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T BE CONFINED TO SEXUAL INFIDELITY WHICH IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT A BUT ALSO EMOTIOAL IND FINANCIAL INTERESTINGLY IF YOU ASK PEOPLE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT WHAT IS INFIDELITY  IN A MARRIAGE MEN TEND TO SAY WELL IT'S OBVIOUS AS SHE HAS SAS SEX WITH SOME ONE ELSE A THAT'S INFIDELITY  WHEREAS WOMEN MY LIKEUD HAVE A BROADER DEFINITION OF INFIDELITY THEY WILL SIGHT THINGS LIKE E MOTIONL INFIDELITY FINANCIAL INFIDELITY AS PART OF THE DEFINITION WHEREIS MEN HAVE THAT MORE NARROW DEFINITION INTERESTING I HAVE A A GOOD FRIEND WHO'S A A COUPLES COUNTS AR OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND A SHE TOLD ME SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT RELATES TO THIS WHICH IS THAT A IN CASES OF INFIDELITY OFTENTIMES THE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS A BETWEEN COUPLES BOILED DOWN TO WHETHER NOT CONTRACEPTION WAS USED OR NOT THAT HECOMES A A KEY FEATURE AND SHE ALWAYS A THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS YOUTO HONT HOMINGIN ON A A DETAIL WHICH OF COURSES AND IMPORTANT DETAILS T RELATES TO BOTH A PATERNITY ISSUES AND PREGNANCY BUT ALSO DISEYS RIGHT BUT A AS WERE TALKING ABOUT ALL THIS IT IT MAKES IT A MAKES ME THINK THAT A THIS MAY HAVE DEEPER EVOLUTIONARY RUTS IN OUR A FURIT FURTHER DOUT IN THE BRAIN AS WE SAY N THE AR OF SOLITA AND A YON AND AMUSING A CONOVERSE S NOT USING ECONOM NOT USING IS A MORE INTIMATE ACT IN A WAY YOU WERE LITERALLY PHYSICALLY MORE INTIMATE WITH SOME ONE ELSE  THAN IF YOU DO USE A CONNUM SO A IN AT BUT WHETHER IT'S A WHETHER EVOLUTIONARY RUSE TO TAS I DON'T KNOW OM ECONOMS ARE PROBABLY RELATIVELY RECENT IN AR LEAST A WIDESPREAD USE O THEM RELATIVELY RECENT AN  EVOLUTIONARY TIMESO I DOUBT WE HAVE ADAPTATIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR THEM NOW IN PRESUMALY BEFORE CONUMS A A ONE CAN ONLY SPECULATE BECAUSE AS WE SAY WITICOMES TO A BEHAVIOR A THERE'S RARELY A FOSSIL RECORD A BUT SOMETIMES THERE IS IT WOULD BE A THE WITHDRAWAL METHOD OF CONTRACEPTION WHICH A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO STUDIES A WHOSE LABORATORY WOR SONE REPRODUCPTIVE BIOLOGY SAYS THE REASON  THAT'S A POOR CHOICE OF CONTRACEPTION IS BECAUSE IT WAS DESIGNED NOT TO SO NOTE NOTE TO THOSE OF A TRYING TO AVOID UNWANTED PREGNANCY SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STATUS IN TERMS OF WHAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE SELECTING FOR A PREDIFFEREN TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS A IS HE ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT STATUS THAT IT H YOU FIND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING AND YOU NOW WHAT MEN ARE FINDING ATTRACTIVE BESIDES THESE UNA WASTO HYBRACIOS AND A A QUQUALITY OF POTENTIAL MOTHERS A AND SO FORTH A THERE ANY KIND OF A HIDDEN GEMS IN THE LITERATURE AROUND THIS THAT A MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD OF A WELL YES SO I YOU MEAN AMONG IU A THINGS LIKE SEX DIFFERENCES IN WHAT LEADS TO HIGH STATUS OR OR FOR INSTANCE OR WHAT A OR PERHAPS THINGS THAT A OR SURPRISING IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE SELECTING FOR DO PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEIR SELECTING FOR THIS IS ORS IS ALL SUBCONSCIOUS ANY AN ALL OF THE THOSE TOPICS AR OF INTEREST TO MEYE SO WELL TO TAKE THEM IN REVERSE ORDER OU NOW I THINK A LOT OF IT IS CONSCIOUS BUT SOME OF IT IS CERTAINLY UNCONSCIOUS WERE THERE ELEMENTS A WHICH ARE TOTALLY UNCONSCIOUS SO I MENTION ONE EARLIER WHERE MAN LOOKS AT WOMAN HE 'S NOT HE'S AWARE THAT HE'S ATTRACTED TO HER AND ATTRACTED TO HER PHYSICAL APPEARANCE BUT HE MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF WHY IN I WE DIDN'T EVAULV TO BE AWARE OF WHY JUST LIKE WITH FOOD PREFERENCES WE WE FIND CERTAIN THINGS THELECTABLE ANOTHER THINGS A IU NAUSEATING WE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE AADAPTIVE LOGIC OF WHY ARE FOOD PREFERENCES EXIST IN WHY WE HAVE THEM AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF MATING AN I WEND SO A MEN FIND WOMEN WITH WITH A LOW WASTE TIPORATIO ATTRACTIVE A BUT THEY MIGHT NOT THTHAT THEY ALMOST RARELY REALELY WILL THEY DOW O LOW WE WASTURPACIUS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER FERTILITY LOWER INTROCANLOGICAL PROBLEMS A AYOU LOWER AGE ET CETERA A SO SO WWE'RE SOMETIMES AWARE WHAT WE WONT UP BUT WE ARE UNAWARE OF WHY WE WANTED SO  SOTHINK THEIR UNCONSCIOUS ELEMENTS THAT THE WHOLE TOPIC OF STATUS AND WHAT LEDS TO HIGH STATUS ON MOST STATUS STOPICAM CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING PUBLISHED A COUPLE SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES ON IT AND A SO BUT MAYBE WILL HOLD OFF ON THAT FOR A A FUTURE DISCUSSION BUT BUT IT INTIT INTERSECT ILL MENTION ONE IT INTERSECTS WITH MATING AND IN INTERESTING WAYS IN THAT HIGHER STATUS GIVES PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO A CHOOSE FROM A WIDER POOL POTENTIAL MATES THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY HAVE LOST STATUS  AND SO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE STRIVE FOR STATUS IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MORE DESIRABLE MATES CONVERSELY HAVING DESIRABLE MATES ENDAWS YOU WITH HIGHER STATUS AND SO IF YOU HAVE IF YOUR AMAIL YOU HAVE A VERY A ATRACTIVE A WOMAN ON YOUR ARM THAT LEADS TO HIGH STATUS AND SO THERE'S A RECIPROCAL LINK BETWEEN STATUS IN MATING IN THAT WAY AND THEY'RE BEEN STUDIES WHERE YOU YOU SAIY I SAID THEY POS A A KIND OF A UNATTTRACTIVE GUY OLDER UNATTRACTIVE GUY AND A STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AS IS A GIRL FRIEND AND THEY SAY  WHAT WHAT WHA WHAT'S HIS GUY ALL ABOUT AND THEY SAIY WELL HE MUST BE VERY HIGH AND STATUS HE MUST BE VERY WEALTHY HE MUST A HAVE A LOT GOING FOR HIM A YOU KNOW WHERE IS THE REVERSE PEOPLE DON'T MAKE THE SAME ATTRIBUTIONS AND SO AND SO THERE IS AN INTERESTING RECIPROCAL LINK BETWEEN STATUS IN MATING SUCCESS WERE MAKE SUCCESS LEADS TO HIGH STATUS AND I STATUS LEADS TO MORE MATING SUCCESS TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN THERE ARE THESE INSTANCES THAT YOU DESCRIBE WHERE THE SESSMENT OF POTENTUAL MADE SECUAL OR LONETRM PARTNERSHIP OR A BEING MADE IN THE CONTENTS OF GOOD STATISTICAL PRACTICES LOOKING AT THE CHOICES OF OTHERS AS A REDOUBT OF YOUR OWN CHOICES A THAT KEEP THIS SEEMS TO BE A THEME THAT THIS IS NOT BEING MADE IN A VERY NARROW C NTEXTS BUT PAYING ATTENTION WHAT OTHER PEOPLE PAYING ATTENTION TO SES TO COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN A SLIGHTLY OFF CENTER FROM THAT BUT STILL PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO A WHAT'S KNOWN ABOUT JEALOUSY IN MEN VERSES WOMEN AND A HOW FREQUENT IT IS HOW INTENSE IT IS AND WHAT PEOPLE DO WITH THAT JEALOUSY O MEAN WE HEAR R IAVE HEARD AT SOME POINT THAT A A LARGE FRACTION UF HOMICIDES ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF JEALOUS LOVERS A THAT'S THE DARKEST ANGLE OF ALL THIS BUT A IN EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY CONTEXT O WHAT IS JEALOUSY A DOES IT RELATE TO PRATERNITY ISSUES ONLY O WOOKI TELLUS YESO WELL I'S A THE GREAT SET OF QUESTIONS IN AND WHEN I FIRST STARTED STUDYING JEALOUSY A I REVIEWED ALL THE PRIOR PUBLICATIONS ON JEALOUSY AND AT THAT TIME JEALOUSY WAS REGARDED AS A AA SIGN OF IMMATURITY A SIGN A A INSECURITY A A SIGN OF A NEROSESS OR PATHOLOGY OR IN SOME CASES DELUSION A AND WHAT I ARGUED A IS  AND DU ARGUE IS THAT JEALOUSY IS AN EVOLVED EMOTION THAT SERVE SEVERAL ADAPTIV FUNCTIONS A A ONE OF WHICH YOU MENTION IS IS A PATERNITY CERTAINTY FUNCTION A BUT THE BUT TO TOBACK UP A SECOND BASY ONCE YOU HAVE THE EVOLUTION OF LONG TERMATING LONG TROM PARBONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FROM A MALE PERSPECTIV INVESTING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES IN A WOMAN AND HER CHILDREN OVER YEARS OR DECADES A ON WITH BOOMERAN KIDS NOW A  GO MORE THAN TO DECADES BOOMERAN KIDS YEA IDS GIDS TO LEAVE HOM AND THEN COME BACK AND LE LIVE AT HOME OTHAT A TO THE O THEY OW YE I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN SO O I A NO IT'S A BIG THING A BUT IF I DO ALL JUST EXPECT THAT THE COMEBACK   COME BACK O THEY THEY CAN'T FIND A JOB OR THEY FIND IT CHEAPER TO LIVE AT THE PARENT'S HOUSE OR WHATEVER FUNKINNESS I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING WORSE I MAN I LOVE MY PRARENTS I NOW ID I GET A CAN IMAGINE BUT A BUT IT HAPPENS AND IT'S HAPPENING MORE AND MORE IN GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION BOOKA BA SO NCE YOU HAVE LONG TURMATING YOU NEED A A A DEFENSE TO PREVENT WERE PRESERVE THE INVESTMENT THAT YOU'VE MADE IN AR MAKING AND LONG ERMATIA AND SO JEALOUSY SERVE THIS A MATE GUARDING FUNCTION IF YOU WILL WERE MATE RETENSION FUNCTIONS SO IN OTHER WORDS ONE WAY OF PHRASING THIS IS THAT WE KNOW THAT THEIR THER AFFAIRS WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE BREAK UP THEY GET DIVORCED A BUT PEOPLE HAVE ADAPTATIONS TO WANT A WHOLD ON TO THEIR MATES AND THAT'S WHAT JEALOUSIES INPART ABOUT AND SO JEALOUSY GETS ACTIVE ATED WHEN THEIRE THREATS TO THAT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHI A NO OTHER FORMS OF JEALOUSY LIKE SIVILING JEALOUSY AND SO FORTH FUXING ON MATING JEALOUSY IN THIS CONTACT SO A NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE THE THREATS TO AN ON GOING VALUED ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP COME FROM MANY SOURCES SO THEY COULD BE YOU DETECT CUES TO YOUR PARTNERS INFIDELITY A A ER CUSE A OF A A LACK OOF AN EMOTIONAL DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR PARTNER YOU YOU SAY I LOVE YOU TO YOUR PARTNER AND YOUR PARTNER SAYS A I WONDER HOW HOW THE NIXS ARE DOING THE SCORING SEASON WHATEVER IF YOU GET AN UNRECIPROCATED I LOVE YOUS A BAD CUE ORE  OR SOME PEOPLE ARE SO TUNE TO THIS IF THERE'S A HALF MILL A SECOND DELAY RAY E CAN DETECT DELAYS IN RESPONT YES YET YE DELAYS IN RESPONSES BUT EVEN THINGS LIKE SO THAT'S ONE SET OF CUES ABUT THEN N ANOTHER SET OF A INTERESTED MATE POACHERS SO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE MATED TO SOMEONE WHOS DESIRABLE A WHICH MANY PEOPLE ARE OTHER PEOPLE STILL DESIRE THEM AND SO SOMETIMES TRIED TO POACH THEM WERE WURE THEM AWAY FROM YOU FOR A SHORT TRM SECTUAL ENCOUNTER OR FOR A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP AND SO WE HAVE TO BE SO JEALOUSY MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO BE ATTENTIVE TO POTENTIAL MATE POACHERS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT ABUT EVEN WERE SUBTLE THINGS LIKE A MATE VALUE DISCREPANCIES CAN TRIGGER JEALOUSY SO EVEN IF THERE ARE NO MATE POACHERS AND NO CUSED INFIDEALITY IF A A MATE VALUE DISCREPANCY OPENS UP IN A RELATIONSHIP SO IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM LIKE YOUR A SIX OR AN EIGHT OR A TEN A AND PEOPLE GENERALLY PAIR OFF BASED ON SIMILARITY IN MATE VALUES SO THAT TENDS TO HAPPEN NIT IS END UP WITH SIX IS SEVENS TEND UP WITH SIX TE A LUST OR MIND US WON'T YET YET RIGHT SO YETHESE ARE  SOMEWHAT SUBJECTIVE YIU SOMEWHAT SUBJECTED BUT THERE' STILL SOME CONSENTSS ABOUT THESE THINGS SO EVEN CLLOQUYY PEOPLE CLLOQUIALLY PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE A A HE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU YOU KNOW WERE I THINK YOU YOU COULD DO BETTER A TO PEOPLE AN IMPLICITLY HAVE A NOTHION OF RELATIVE MATE VALUE AND DISCREPNCIES THEREIN E BUDISCREPANCIES CAN OPEN UP WHERE NONE PREVIOUSLY EXISTED SO YOU GET FIRED FROM A JOB ALL A SUDDEN YOU KNOW AND MOST PEOPLE ARE VERY UNDERSTANDING AND FORGIVING ABOUT THAT IF IT'S NOT TOO LONG BUT YOU GO SIX MONTHS EIGHT MONTHS PEOPLE START HAVING PROBLEMS WERE SOMEONE'S CAREER TAKES OFF WILL SAY A WOMAN BECOMES A A FAMOUS SINGER ORE ACTRESS OR OR R A MAN DOES A CREER TAKES OFF ALL A SUDDENERS O MATE VALUE DISCREPANCY WHERE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A LARGER POOL POTENTIAL MATES AND HIGHER MATE VALUE POTENTIAL MATES SO SO PEOPLE ARE ATTENTIVE TO MATE VALUE DISCREPANCIES AND SO JEALOUSY CAN GET ACTIVATED EVEN IF THERE ARE NO IMMEDIATE THREATS TO RELATIONSHIP BUT TH THE MATE VALUE DISCREPANCY IS AY THREAT THAT LOOMS ON THE HORIZON OF THE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE WE KNOW STATISTICALLY THE HIGH OR MATE VALUE PERSON IS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE AN AFFAIR AND IS MORE LIKELY TO DUMP THE OTHER PERSON AND TRADE UP IN THE MATING MARKET AND WHEN PEOPLE FIND A NEW PARTNERS FOR LONG TURN RELATIONSHIPS DO THEY TEND TO TRADE UP ON AVERAGE YES IF THE DISCREPANCY IF THE DISCREPANCY IS SUFFICIENTLY VARGE SO SSO THEIR COST ASSOCIATE WITH BREAKING UP  IN A DIVORCING FOR EXAMPLE IM IS AT EMOTIONALLY FINANCIALLY IT'S A COSTLY THING AND SO IF YOU HAVE LIKE A HALF A POINT MATE VALUE DISCREPANCY YOU'RE NOT CONCY A LOT OF BREAK UPS BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE LARGER MAY TY DISCREPANCIES THAT'S GENATE VAGER WERE FOR A TRADING UP IN THE MATING MARKET A SO BUT SAI THEN THEN YOU GET INTO N SO WHAT JEALOUSY IS IT'S AN EMOTION THAT GETS ACT IV AED BY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEN WHAT PEOPLE DO ABOUT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEIR OCTIONS ARE AND PEOPLE DO THINGS THAT I AT IN MY PUBLISHED SCIENTIFIC WORK I SAY RANGE FROM VIGILANCE TO VIOLENCE SO THERE'S WHOLE SPECTRUM OF THINGS AND FECT OF IDENTIFIED NINETEEN DIFFERENT TACTIS THE PEOPLE USE TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS ONCE THEY GET JEALOUS AND ONE IS INCREASED VIGILANCE AND THE OTHER VIGILANCE FOR THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MATE YET VISIONS FOR THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MADEN IN THAT CONCLUDE A A STOLKING FOLLOWING ACTING INTO I FUNS OR OR COMPUTERS O A MONITURING A THE BEHAVIOR OF MATE POACHERS LOOKING AT I CONTACT BETWEEN OTHER MEN AN YOUR PARTNER  THERE THE WHOLE SUITE OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE INIS INVOLVED IN IN VIGILENCE A AND THEN AT THE OTHER EXTREME AND WE TALK ABOUT THINGS IN BETWEEN THE OTHER EXTREME IS VIOLENCE AND SO IN MY NEW BOOK A WHEN MEN BEHAVE BADLY HAVE THE WHOLE CHAPTER ON INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND THIS IS A A WHAT I ARGUE IN THIS IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE AND I'M NOT ADORSE IT'S ILLEGAL IT'S BAD DON'T DO IT BUT PEOPLE ENGAGE IN INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE A IN AMERICA SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY PER CENT OF ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE MARRIED WILL EXPERIENCE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IN THEIR IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP SO IS NOT A TRIVIAL PERCENTAGE AN THAT VIOLENCE IS BETWEEN THE TO PART IN THE TWO PARTNERS YES A THERE'S ALSO VIOLENCE THAT GETS DIRECTED TO R POTENTIAL MATE POACHERS BUT THAT'S THAT'S A SOMEWHAT SEPARATE ISSUE A BU ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS FUNCTIONAL ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IS THAT IT TENDS TO REDUCE PERCEIVED AN MATE VALUE TISCREPANCIES SO ANOTHER OF US SAY IT'S A I AN GUIDES TEND TO ENGAGE IN THE VIOLENCE MORE THAN WOMEN DO ALTHOUGH SOME ARGUE THAT THERE'S MORE EQUALITY IN THE VIOLENCE ON BUT ATD A MINUMA MEN TEND TO DO MORE DAMAGE WHEN THEY DO THE VIOLENCE AND WHEN YOU TRIE ABOUT VIOLENCE IS THIS EVER EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE I MEAN THE THERE'S THAT AS WELL AND IN FACT THAT TWO TEND TO BE CORRELATED SO IN MY STUDIES OF MARRIED COUPLES OM VERBAL VIOLENCE IS A GOOD PREDICTOR A PHYSICAL VIOLENCE HAPPENING AS WELL SO ONE THINGS THAT HAPPEN JUST TO GIVE A CONCRETE EXAMPLE GUIS WILL START INSULTING THEIR PARTNER'S APPEARANCE YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING UGLY TO DAY YOUR YOUR THIGHTS AR HEAVY OR YOU KNOW YOW NOT LOOKING VER GOOD SO THE TRY TO DENTEGRATE THE WOMAN'S APPEARANCE WHICH IS A KEY COMPONENT OF WOMAN'S MATE VALUE SO THE TRYING TO A JUST MORE CLOSELY THE MATE VALUE DISCRUP YET THE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE HER PERCEIVE SELF RECEIVED MATE VALUE SO IF IF LETS A HE'S IS SIX SHE'S IN AID AND HE CAN CONVINCE HER THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY ONLY A SEX A THEN SHE'S GET E MORE LIKELY TO STAY WITH THEM VERY DIABOLICAL IT'S TERRIBLY DIABOLICAL BUT THE FACT IS WOMEN DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES OM WHEN THEY GET A BEATEN UP  BY THEIR PARTNER IN FACT IT IN IN THE CASES WHERE IT LEAVES PHYSICAL EVIDENCE IN A WOMEN WHERE SUN GLASSES OR OTURTLE NECS OR COVER UP THE THE BRUISES IS AS LITERALLY DOES LOWER THE MATE VALUE OF THE WOMEN BY I INJURING HER PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND GETTING HER TO CONCEAL HERSELF STAY HOME YE EXACTI YE SHE'S TAKING HER OUT OF THE THE  LITERALLY TAKE REDUCING HER VISIBILITY RIGT AND AND THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE PREDICTORS OF VIOLENCE IS IF HE STARTS DOING THINGS OTHER THAN VIOLENCE LIKE COTTING LOFF FOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH HER FRIENDS IN HER FAMILY TRYING TO SUQUEST OR HER I AND PREVENT HER FROM GETTING EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL OTHER OTHER OTHER PARTNERS AND SO IT IS A VERY DIABOLICAL BUT I THINK IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE THE POTENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY OF OF INTIMATE PART OR VIOLENCE SO WHAT ABOUT IT AS STAR TO INTERRUPT AGAIN BUT A JUST SO CURIOUS SO A OFTENTIMES WHI OUT ANCH WILL SAY  INTERRUPT TOO OFTEN BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT  DON'T MISS IT AN OPPORTUNE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION FEMALE TO MALE WHERE STERITIPICALLY SPEAKING THAT THE OPPORTUNING FOR PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS STILL THERE BUT THE THE IDEA IN MIND IS THAT I IT WOULD BE MORE OF A PSYCHE LOGICAL NATURE ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT HAT SOME WOMEN BEAT THEIR HUSBANDS YE BUT IT I'M GUESSING IT YO NOT IS FREQUENT OR MY ALTHOUGH WELL DIFFERENT STUDIES SO IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU JUST SIMPLY COUNT UP ACTS OR WHETHER YOU LOOK AT THE DAMAGE IT IS DONE AN AND AS I MENTION MEN TEND TO DO MORE PHYSICAL DAMAGE SO THEIR SHELTERS FOR BATTERED WOMEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS I KNOW THER'S ONE FOR BATTERED MEN NOW IT MAY BE AND THIS IS PARTLY TRUE THAT MEN ARE A MORE ASHAMED IF THEY GET BEATEN UP BY THEIR PARTNER CLOCK WITH A FRYING PAN I AND AIT'S POSSIBLE AND THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT POLICE DON'T CTAKE IT AS SERIOUSLY SO THERE'S ONE CASE THAT I REPORT IN MY BOOK WHERE A GUY A CALLED THE POLICE AND HIS WIFE A CLOCDOM WITH SOMETHING AND A POLICE SHOWS UP AND HE SAYS THA IF SHE'S SO MUCH AS BROKE A FINGER NAL IN THIS ALTERCATION THEY'LL CHARGE YOU AND NOT HER AND SO THERE'S A THERE IS A A POLICE ON BYAS A AEPOTENTIAL POLICE BYUS IN THIS AND SO THERE MAY BE UNDERREPORTING OF WOMEN BEATING UP MEN AS A CONSEQUENCE A CEBU THE MOTIVATIONS ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT SO ONE IS THAT MALE SEXUAL JEALOUSY WILL TRIGGER HIM TO ATTACK HIS PARTNER AND THEN SHE WILL USE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TO DEFEND HERSELF SO SHE MIGHT PICK UP AND A  FRYING PAN OR YOU KNOW OR OR WEAPON OF SOME SORT TO DEFEND HERSELF AND SO THE MOTIVATION IS HIS SEXUAL JEALOUSY ON HIS PART BUT SELF DEFENCE ON HER PART AND SO THAT ACCOUNTS FOR SOME UNKNOWN PERCENTAGE OF THE CASES AND IN SOME CASES IT IS WHOMEN WHO WERE OUTRAGE WHEN THEY DISCOVER THEIR PARTNERS BEN HAVING SEXT WITH SOME ONE ELSE AN INFIDELITY O OF A SEXUAL FINANCIAL OR EMOTIONAL NATURE AND SO THERE IS SOME FEMALE TO MALE VIOLENCE THAT ABSOLUTELY OCCURS ABUT THE THE REDUCTION OF A PERCEIVE MATE VALUE DISCREPNANCY IS A KEY FUNCTION FROM MALE PERSPECTIVE NOT AGAIN NOT THAT HE THINKS ABOUT THIS HE'S JUST ANGRY AND WANTS TO HERT HER  BUT BUT HERE HERES ONE OTHER THING THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING AT ABOUT THE INTIMAPARTER VIOLENCE ND THAT'S THE SPECIFICITY OF IT DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES AND NAMELY WHEN THE WOMAN GETS PREGNANT SHE'S MORE VULNERABLE TO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND WHEN THE MAN SUSPECTS THAT HE'S NOT THE FATHER OF THAT PREGNANCY HE'S MORE LIKELY TO DIRECT THE VIOLENCE TOWARD BLOWS TO HER ABDEMON  IT'S THAT'S THAT'S SPECIFIC AND SO IN THAT CASE THE FUNCTION IS IS HYPOSSTIS FUNCTION IS DETERMINATE THE PREGNANCY BY A RIVAL MALE AAS OPPOSED TO DETERING THE WOMAN FROM COMMITTING AN INFIDELITY OR FROM LEAVING THE RELATIONSHIP ENTIRELY SO THAT'S WHY ONE FUNCTION VENTI A PART OR VIOLENCEIS IS JUST SEQUESTURANG WOMAN IN KEEPING HER ALL TO HIMSELF A SO IT'S BOTH TO PREVENT INFIDELITY AND TO PREVENT DEFECTION I HAVE A A FRIEND A WHO A WIFE TOLD ME A THAT IF SHE IF HE CHEATS I'LL KILL HIM THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID A BUT IT'S ASHALLY JUST MUCH EASIER TO KEEP HIM VERY VERY BUSY AND A AND THAT STATEMENT NOW IT LEAPS TO MINE BECAUSE AOF WHAT YOURE DESCRI VING THAT THEARE MANY TACTICS BY WHICH PEOPLE CAN ENGAGE THIS EFFORT TO REDUCE THE MATE VALUE DISCREPANCY NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE AVERTLY VIOLENT YO OT SOME ARE BUT ALL OF WHICH ARE DESIGNE TO CONSTRAIN THEIR BEHAVIOR RIGHT RIGHT YET THESE WORES TO THESE WHUCH FALL UNDER WHAT I WOULD CALL MATE RETENSION TACTICS  ONLY ONE OR TWO OF WHICH A FALL UNDER THE VIOLENCE CATEGORY YETHERR EVEN A YET A A WITHIN PARTNER PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS O THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATIONS ABOUT PERCEIVED MATE VALUE A YOU KNOW NO ONE ELSE WOULD WANT YOU I YOU KNAW OUR YOUR  LOSER THERE'S DENEGRATION OF PARTNER WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP A EVEN FEIGNING ANGER TO MAKE THE PARTNER FEEL GUILTY AB SAY LOOKING AT SOME ONE ELSE  SO U SO THERE'S ALL ALL KINDS OF A INTERNESCING WARFARE THAT GOES ON WITHIN RELATIONSHIPS TO MANIPULATE PERCEPTIONS OF THESE THING THIS IS SOME CREATING A MUCH TOO JATED VIEW OF ROMANCE AND LOVE  OH NO WE WILL GET TO THE THE THE HAPPY ENDINGS AND AND I MING THERE CERTAINLY MANY HAPPY RELATIONSHIPS OUT THERE I  YOU KNOW AS A NORO SCIENTIST I HEAR ABOUT THIS AND AND THE A IMMEDIACY OF OF  HOW PEOPLE YET'L FALL INTO A A PATTERN OR JEALOUSY OR A A PATTERN OF CHEATING AND NOT ALWAYS BUT AND AND I  JUST SPEAKS TO A BRING CIRCUITRY THAT'S OF ALVE TO PROTECT SOMETHING AND A I'M SURE THIS STATEMENT IS A NOT EXHAUSTIVE BUT I THINK IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY THAT EVERY SPECIES BUT A I ESPECIALLY HUMANS WANTS TO MAKE MORE OF ITSELF AND PROTECT ITS YOUNG BUT THESE ISSUES OF PRATERNITY AND A RESOURCEOLICATION IM I THINK THEIR VITAL AND YET I LOOK FOR TO A DAY WHERE EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY AND NOR SCIENCE ARE A CON MERGE AT THE LEVEL OF OF UNDERLYING MECHANISM BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A DARK I THINK IT'S JUST THE THE WAY REWIRED THAT SOME WONL A SPEAKING OF DARK A COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE DARK TRY AT YESO THE DARK TRIADS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SEX DIFFERENCES ON AVERAGE BUT THERE ARE CRITICAL WITHIN SECTS INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND THE DARK TRYAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES THE DARK TRIAT CONSISTS OF THREE PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS SO NARCISISM MACHUVALIANISM AND PSYCHOPATHY HALLMARKS OF NARCICISM ARE THINGS LIKE A GRANDIOSITY PERSON THINKS THAT THEARE MORE INTELLIGENT WERE A TRACTIVE MORE DAZZLING MORE CHARMING THAN THE ACTUALLY ARE I THINK THER THE GREATEST PERSONS IN SLIGCE BREAD A IMPORTANTLY WITH NARCICISM YOU ALSO GET A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT A TO THEY FEEL ENTITLED TO A LARGER SHARE OF THE PIE WHETHER THAT BE THE FINANCIAL PIE THE STATISPIE OR THE SEXUAL PIE A A MACHUVALIANISM A IS HIGH SCORS TEN TO PURSUE AN EXPLOITED IVE SOCIAL STRATEGY SO THEY MIGHT FAIN COOPERATION BUT THEN SHE YOU KNOW ON PSUBSEQUENT MOVES A THEY VIEW OTHER PEOPLE AS PLANS TO BE MANIPULATED FOR THEIR OWNINSTRUMENTAL GAINS A AND THEN PSYCOPATHY ONE OF THE HOMARKS OF PSYCOPATHY IS A LACK OF AMPATHY SO MOST PEOPLE HAVE A NORMAL EMPATHY SIRCUT WERE IF A CHILD FALLS DOWN AND GETS HER WE FEEL COMPASSION FOR THE HARM THAT THAT PERSON IS UNDERGOING WERE IF A A POPPY GETS A HIT BY A CARE WHATEVER WE FEEL COMPASSION A PSYCHOPATS DONT THOUGH THAT IS THOSE HIGHENS DEMITS A DIMENSIONAL THING IT'S NOT A CATEGORICAL  THINKS O THOS HIGH AND PSYCOPATHY A BASICALLY LACK AMPATHY A AND SO IF YOU COMBINE THESE QUALITIES ND ARCISISM PSYCOPATHY AMACHIAN VANI MACIVANISM YOU YOU HAVE A WHAT SOME VERY BAD DUDES AND I SAY BAD DUCE GOOS MENTEND TO SCORE HIER IN THESE THINGS THAN WOMEN ESPECUALLY ON THE PSYCOPATHY DIMENSION SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CLINICAL LEVELS OF PSYCOPATHY IT'S A ESTIMATED TO BE SOMETHING LIKE ONE PERCENT OF WOMEN ABOUT FOR PERCENT OF OF MEN'S A MEN A ARE MUCH HIGHER IND THAT SO WHISEST IMPORTANT WELL IT'S IMPORTANT IN THE MAIDING CONTACT BECAUSE A THOSE WHO WARE HIGH AND DARK TRYAT TRAITS TEND TO BE A A SEXUAL DECEIVERS FOR ONCE OF THEIR VERY OFTEN VERY CHARMING A VERY GOOD SEDUCING WOMEN AND THEN ABANDONING THEM SOMETIMES WITH A AFTER FLEECING THEM A OR DRAINING THEIR BANK ACCOUNT A THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT A AT THE ART OF SEDUCTION A THEY ARE ALSO TEND TO BE SEXUAL HARASSERS SERIAL SEXUAL RASSERS AN SEXUAL COORCERS A A SO WHEN IT COMES TO FORMS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE A HYDAR TRYA GUISES TEND TO BE PERPETRATORS OF THIS AND SO LIKE MOST MEN I THINK A WOULD BE AFIND IT ETHICALLY ABHORRENT TO SEXUALLY HARASS SAY A WOMAN IN THE WORKPLACE DARK TRYAT GUISES IMPORT MAYBE THEY FEEL ENTITLED TO IT AND AND AND IMPORT THEY DO I MEAN SOME CASES THAT I REPORT IN THE BOOK THERE LIKE LITERAL DESCRIPTIONS WHERE THE GUIS ARE WRITING IN THESE JOURNALS I I KNEW SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO ME AND THAT THAT'S WHY SHE SHE MET ME IN THE A ZEROC'S ROOM JUST WHEN I WAS THERE TO SHE WANTED TO ADMIRE MY BULGING BISEPS OR WHATEVER IS ALL ABOUT THEM THEY YE HEY THEY THEY THE IN THIS GETS INTO A BIAS THAT I TALK ABOUT WHICH IS THE THE MALE SEXUAL MISPERCEPTION BY US WHERE WOMEN SMILES AT A MAN MAN THINKS OUT SHE'S SHE WANTS MY BODY SHE'S ATTRACTED TO ME AND WOMEN ARE THINKING I'M JUST BEING FRIENDLY ON BEING POLITE OR PROFESSIONAL A BUT THESE GUYES HIGH DARK TRY GUYES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE A SEXUAL OVER PERCEPTION BY US AND THEY LITERALLY BELIEVE THAT THE WOMAN IS ATTRACTEV TO THEM AND SENDING THEM SIGNALS GREEN LIGHT A TWO SEXUALLY APPROACH A AND SO IF YOU COMBINE DARK DARK TRYA TRATS WITH THE DISPOSITIONAL PURSUIT OF A SHORT TERMATING STRATEGY THAT'S AN ESPECUALLY DEADLY COMMINATION THAT'S WHEN YOU GET SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL COERCION SO THESE THESE ARE VERY BAD DUTES A ALSO A PREDICTORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE WHAT WHAT AAPPROXIMATE FREQUENCY IN THE MALE POPULATION OR THESE HAVE ALL THREE THE DARK TRIET TRAITS AND I REALISE THE THROUGHT A CONTINUUM SO S A YET THAT'S WAS THT'S THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SAY OUT AS THEY ARE ON A CONTINUUM AND IT'S SORT OF ARBITRARY WERE YOU WHERE YOU DRAW THE LINE A BUT BUT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A MINORITY OF MEN IT'S A SUBSET OF MEN WHO COMMIT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT LIKE IF YOU IF YOU LOOK VICTIMS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THEYARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE PERPETRATORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE BECAUSE THE PERPETRATORS TEND TO BE SERIAL OFFENDERS SO TO SPEAK ONE GUY IN THE WORK PLACE HARASSING FIFTEEN DIFFERENT WOMEN ONE GUY SEXUALLY COERCING IN A MULTIPLE WOMEN SUCH WHAT YOU HAVE LIKE A IN WELL KNOWN CASES IN THE NEWS LIKE CARVEY WINE STEAM YOU KNOW PROBABLY OVER A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WOMEN A BILL COSBE GJEFFREY ABSTINT SOME ITIES A MORE FAMOUS CASES THESE ARE LARGE NUMBER OF VICTIMS BUT PRETTY MUCH SOULS SA OU O PERPETRATORS  AN AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THESE GUYES A ALIKE HARVEY WINE STEAN  JEFFREY HAV STING WERE DEFINITELY HIGH UND AR TRYAD TRAITS A YOU MENTIONS TALKING BRIEFLY A TAY WE COUL JUST TALK ABOUT A A SOME OF THE LESS KNOWN FEATURES ABOUT STALKING I I THINK I ONCE HEARD YOU GIVE A LECTURE WHERE YOU SAID THAT A ONE OF THE SCARIOUS THINGS ABOUT STALKING IS THAT SOMETIMES IT WORKS YES YE SO WELL STAKING A HAS MULTIPLE MOTIVATIONS BUT ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT MOTIVATIONS IS A A A MATING MOTIVATION WERE EITHER THE THERE'S A BREAK UP AND THE WOMEN DUMPS THE GUY AND THE GUY DOESN'T WAN TO GET DOMPT YOU WANTS TO MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER AND I SHOULD SAY THAT AND WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMINAL STALKING THEREIS A HUGE SEX DIFFERENCE ABOUT EIGHTY PERSENT OF THE STALKERS TEND TO BE MEN BOUT TWENTY PERCENT WOMEN SO THERE'S SO THERE ARE WOMEN'S STALKERS BUT THERE A A YOU KNOW ABOUT A FOURTH THE NUMBER COMPARED TO TO MEN SO THE MOTIVATION OF THE GUYS TENDS TO BE EITHER AN ATTEMPT TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH THE WOMEN EITHER SECUALLY OR IN A RELATIONSHIP OR AND WORE TO INTERFERE WITH HER FUTURE MADING PROSPECTS I AND IT WORKS IN IN SOME OF THE TIME IN TWO SENSES ONE IS IT DOES INTERFERE WITH HER ATTEMPTS TO REMATE SO A IN FACT IT SCARES OFF SOME GUISE SO LIKE YOU SHOW UP AND TO PICK UP A WOMAN AT HER APARTMENT FOR A DATE AND HER HER EXAS SITTING OUT THERE GLARING AT YOU OR A ADI AM I SHOULD FAMILIAR WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE EARLY IN IN A RELATIONSHIP SOMEBODY MENTIONS THAT IN AXTS HAS MADE AM VAILED THRATS ABOUT SURVEILLANCE FOR INSTANCE YES I I THAT SHE HAD TO HAPPEN SEVERAL TIMES IN MY DATING HISTORY WHERE SOME ONE WOULD SAY YOU KNA STAR T OPENING UP ABOUT PREVIOUS RELATINSHIPS A LITTLE BIT AS APPROPRIATE IN SOMEONE SAYS YET YOU KNOW HE MENTION THAT HE WAS GON AS YOU KNOW SEND SOMEONE AROUND TO YOU KNOW TO SURVEILE ME YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING WHICH IS A VERY INTERESTING AM FACTOIN TO PICK UP IN A BUT I HURT IT ENOUGH TIMES UM AND PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE REPORTED TA HEARING THIS ENOUGH TIMES TID I A'M GUESSING THA THAT'S PROBABLY MORE FREQUENT THAN PEOPLE ACTUALLY TRAILING PEOPLE IN CARS AN THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT PLANTING THAT IT'S A THE PSYCHOLOGICAL O YES SURVEILLANCE IS IS A FORM OF OF HARASSMEN IN SOME SON YES ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE EREIN THERE'S THAT PLANTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SEEDS BUT THEN ALSO WITH SURVEILLANCE A SOME SURVEILLERS REMAINED HIDDEN SO YOU DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY YI I CONFESS IN THIS CASE IT DID NOT ACT AS A DETERN FOR CONTINUING THE RELATIONSHIP  THAT'S WHAT AM BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY SO UM SO HOW OFTEN DO WOMEN RESPOND  HAVE TO PUT THIS IN QUOTES A FOR THOSE THARE LISTENING EIR QUOTS AND QUOTS POSITIVELY TO TOLK MEAN HOW OFTEN DOES IT WORK TO A RESECURE THE PARTNER AFTER THEY'VE BEEN BROKEN ELL SO IN  IN OUR STUDIES UM IT'S A MINORITY OF CASES THAT IT WORKS TO AA RE ESTABLISHD I THINK SOMETHING LIKE FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE TIME THAT IT WORKS EITHER TO TEMPORARILY REESTABLISH A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP OR LURE THE WOMAN BACK IN FOR MORE PAENTRELATIONSHIP SO MOST OF TIME IT DOESN'T WORK BUT M A ONE WOMAN IN OUR STUDY SAID UM THE GUY EVERY TIME SHE WENT OUT WITH ANOTHER GU HE WOULD THREATEN THE OTHER GUY AND SHE SAIT AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS THERE WERE ANOTHER GUISE HE BASICALLY SCARED OFF ALL THE OTHER GUISE AND SO SHE WENT BACK TO IM BECAUSE THERE WERE NO OTHER GUISE AROUND I I EXPERIENCE THIS WOUN A IWAS IN COLLEGE I LIVED IN A SMALL TOWN VERY POPULATION DENSE UM ILL OF THISTA YOU SEE SAINTA BARBARA AND THERE WAS A COUPLE WHERE EVERY TIME AM THIS WOMAN WOULD DATE SO WHEN HE BASELY BEAT UP WHOEVER THE NEW SUITOR WAS AND PRETTY SOON KNO ON GO NEAR THEM THEY GOT A REPUTATION AS THE CONTISCITIN DANCY COUPLE UM AND INDEED IT WORK I A IT WORKED IN THE SENSE TH IT A NO ONE DARE GO NEAR HER  AND THEY ENDED UP TOGETHER SO I THIS O I'VE SEEN REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OF THIS YEA SO IT HAPPENS BUT BUT IT IS IT IS AN IN GENERAL NOT AN NOT A SUCCESSFUL STRAT OH KNOWN IT'S NOT ONE I'M SUGGESTING IVE OSA SHOCK TO LEARN THAT CAUSE WE HEAR STALKING AND WE WE HAVE THIS A THERE'S ONE VERY EXTREME IMAGE OF IT BUT THE UNDERLYING MOTIVATIONS I THINK AR AR A REVEAL SOMETHING ABOUT A YEOUT MEATING DYNAMICS YEAND I THINK THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE OFTEN A MAD VALUE DISCREPANCY WHERE THE GU REALIZES CORRECTLY THAT HE WILL BE UNABLE TO REPLACE HER WITH A MADE OF EQUIVALENT MADE VALUE  WER WERE IN SOME CASES IN ANY MATE YETS LYCLAS SHE SHE WAS WITH ME ONCE MAY BE SHE I CAN GET HER BACK WITH ME AGAIN SO A SO THE PSYCHOLOGY IS VERY UNDERSTANDABLE BUT ABUT IT TENDS ITTENDS NOT TO WORK BECAUSE AND ANOTHER THING WE FOUND WE TO STUDY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED VICTIMS OF STOCKINGS IS WITH JOSHTON THE AFORMER STUDENTO MIND WHOS NOW A PROFESSOR IN A CRIMINALOGY DEPARTMENT AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE WERE LARGE A SEX TO  LARGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE STCKER AND THE VICTIM OF THE STOCKER WHERE WHERE THE STOCKER TENDS TO BE MUCH LOWER IN MADE VALUE THEN THE VICTIM AND SO BASICALLY THE IS TYPICALLY THE WOMAN WHO REALIZES SHE CAN DO A LOW BETTER ON THE MADING MARKET AND THE GUI REALIZES I AM NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO REPLACE HER A WITH A WITH A WOMAN OF EQUIVALENT MAD VALUE AND SO AM GING TO USED TIS LAST TICH DESPERATE MEASURED O TRY TO GET HER BACK AND OCCASIONALLY AT WORKS A IN THINKING MORE ABOUT THIS FV ATE A MATE VALUE A THING THIS IS IS NUMBER THES METRIC THEY AT TEN SIX A WHATEVER IT IS A AND MADE VALUE TISCREPANCY PLAYING SUCH A STRONG ROLE IN  IN ALL THESE DYNAMICS A I SHOULD HAVE ASKED IS EARLIER BUT WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON A MATE VALUE PERCEIVED OR REAL A OF A WOMAN HAVING ALREADY HAD CHILDREN YOU KNOW A FOR INSTANCE A THERE AFRIENDS OF MINE WHO ARE MARRIED IN DIVORCE WO HAVE CHILDREN WOFTEN POST PICTURES OF THEMSELVES WITH THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR OWN LINE PROFILES BECAUSE IT SHOWS A A STRONG SENSE OF PATERNAL INSTINCT A YOU KNOW THERS THE PUPPY THING A A PEOPLE  WITH DOGS OR PUPPIES AT DEMONSTRATING CARE AT A CAPACITY TO CARE AND AND FORCARETAKING A IN WOMEN THE THE OFPOSES ALSO TRUE WOMENEN CHILDREN SHOW CAPACITY IT DEMONSTRATES FERTILITY AT LEAST AT AT ONE POINT PERHAPS STILL A FERTILITY THAT STILL PRESENT A DOES IT POSITIVELY NEGATIVELY ER NEUTRALLY IMPACT A WOMAN TO ALREADY HAVE CHILDREN WHEN SEEKING A ANOTHER MATE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT SHE WAS MARRIED OR HAD THE CHILDREN OUT OF WITYEAS A GENERAL RULE IT DECREASES HER MATE VALUE BECAUSE KIDS WITH ANOTHER MADE OR VIEWED AS A COST NOT NOT A BENEFIT AND THERE A COST ON MULTIPLE A A DIMENSIONS ONE OF WHICH THERE GOING TO BE A COST TO THE GUY A BECAUSE HE'S CAN TO HAVE TO INVEST RESOURCES A TIME ATTENTION SO FORTH BUT ALSO APPORTION OF HER EFFORT AND RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE DEVOTED TOWARD KIDS WHO WERE NOT GENETICALLY RELATED TO HIM AND WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY STEP FAMILIES THERE'S OFFON A LOT OF CONFLICT WITHIN STEP FAMILIES VERY EXPLICABLE FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE INJUS O IN GENERAL IT'S A COST NOT A BENEFIT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE A BENEFIT ASAD Y I KNOW ONE KASE WERE WOMAN GOT TO VORE SHE HAD TWO KIDS AND SHE ANDED UP SUCCESSFULLY MADING WITH A GUY WHO WAS ALSO DIVORCE AND HAD PRIMARY COSTIDY OF HIS TWO KIDS AND SO THERE WAS A COMPATIBILITY THERE BUT IS A GENERAL RULE IT WILL DECREASE A WOMAN'S AND THE MAN'S MATE VALUE TO HAVE KIDS ESPECIALLY KIDS WHO ARE FINANCIAL WHO WERE YOUNG AND FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT A BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS LESS AY THE WOMAN WOULD BE IN AID WITHOUT KIDS A GUY WHO'S A SIX MIGHT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT HER A A AND MIGHT FEEL LUCKY A TO ATTRACT HER BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT OR UNDER OTHER CONDITIONS BUT A THAT'S WHY THE DISPLAY OF EFFORT INVESTING IN HER KIDS IS OFTEN A MADING TACTIC HES SHOWING UP AM WILLING TO INVESTEN IN KIDS AN WOING TO SACRIFICE AND SO THEY INESSENCE BECOME EQUIVALENT IN MATE VALUE A AS A RESULT OF THAT BUT A WILL SHE BE ABLE TO ATTRACT ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW OTHER AITES O LESS LIKELY BUT TH SAME IS TRUE OF GUISES AND THIS IS WHY THE THE ITHE THE REASON THAT AFFECTS WOMEN MORE THAN MEN IS CAUSE MORE COSTIDY TENDS TO GO WITH WOMEN THAT IS THE KID WOMEN TAN HAVE GREATER COSTODY  AND WOMEN TEND TO INVEST MORE IN THE KIDS A THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES A NOW THERE OTHER THINGS LIKE ALAMONTY AND CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS AND SO FORTH BUT  AL ALL THE WOMEN I'VE TALKED TO ADA FOCT TO ONE OF WHONE ALONG WITH MANY WOMEN ABOUT THIS THEY VIEW A GUY WITH KIDS AS A COST NOT A BENEFIT UNLESS THE KIDS ARE OLD ENOUGH IN THEY'VE LEFT HOME AND ANO FUNT NO LONGER FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT AND EVERYTHING YOU JUST DESCRIBED A IS CONSISTEN WITH WITH WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER WHICH IS THAT WITH SUBSEQUENT MARRIAGES ERE AS MEN GET OLDER THE TENDENCY IS TO A SEEK MATES THAT ARE PROGRESSIVELY YOUNGER RIGHT RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S A HIGHER A LOWER PROBABILITY THEY'LL ALREADY HAVE CHILDREN IF THERE IF THERE MUCH ALL RIGHT RIGHT AN THERE AN AND IF THE GUYES SUCCESSFUL IF HE HAS STATUS AND RESOURCES AND AS OTHER QUALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MATE VALUE THAN HE WILL REMAIN ATTRACTIVE TO YOUNGER WOMEN I REALIZE IT'S NOT YOUR SPECIFIC AREA OF EXPERTHESE BUT THESE DAYS THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOU UT HOW REALY CHILDHOOD ATTACHMENT TO PARENTS INFLUENCES MATE CHOICE LATER ON THIS A CAN A GENERAL CATERBRIZATION OF AVOIDING AND ANXIOUS AND ANXIOUS AVOIDANT AND ALL THIS KIND OF THING UM AND AGAIN A PUTTING MY HAT ON AS A NURVOE SCIENTIST I THINK YOU KNOW IT IT MAKE SENSE THAT THE NORL CIRCUITS FOR FOR ATTACHMENT UM IN CHILDHOOD WOULD BE SOMEHOW PARTLY OR IN WHOLE REPURPOSE FOR OTHER FORMS OF ATTACHMENT WE DON'T JUST TEND IT SIY DON'T GET THAT BRAIN CIRCUITRY WAS FOR WHEN I WAS A KID AND ELMAN ADULTANCE ALL DEVELOP THIS NEW ATACHMENT CIRCUITRY I'M GUESSING IT EVOLVES AND AND WHAT NOT BUT U IS THERE ANYTHING INTERESTING ABOUT A THAT ABOUT CHILDHOOD ATTACHMENT STRATEGIES VIES OF THE STABILITY OF LONG TURN PARTNER CHOICE ORS THAT TOO BIG A VELEP FOR US TO MAKE HERE YE WELL I MAY LIK AN OFFER A SOME SIR INFORM SPECULATION ABOUT IT AND AND AS YOU PUN IS NOT MY MYEREF EXPERTIES BUT I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT AND A I MAY I THINK THAT YOU KNOW SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE IF BOTH PARTNERS HAVE A SECURE ATTACHMENTS NOT AS CONDUCIVE TO A LONG TERM MATESHIP AM AVOIDANC ATTACHMENT STYLES AVOIDING PEOPLE TEND TEA YU HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY WITH INTIMACY AND ALSO HIGHER PROBABILITY OF INFIDELITY A AND N ANXIOUS ATTACHMENT STYLE II DON'T KNOW CAN A CREATE THE PROBLEMS OF ITS OWN YOU KNOW AN OVERLY CLINGY DEPENDEN YOU KNOW OBSORBING WHAT WHAT I CALL HIGH RELATIONSHIP BELOWD S O YNOTHERS LIKE MUTATION LOAD WHICH WE ALL HAVE CERTAIN REMUTATION THERE'S A IN A A PARASITE LOAD THERE'S ALSO WHAT I CALL RELATIONSHIP BELOWD SO WHAT IS THE BAGGAGE OT SOMONE BRINGS TO THE RELATIONSHIP AND PROBABLY CORRELATED WITH THE FREQUENCY OF DEMAND OF IMMEDIATE TEXT MESSAGE RESPONSE WHY THINK THITE FREQUNCY OF DEMANT LIKE THE THE LATENT THE EXPECTED LOW LATENCY OF TEXT MESSAGE RESPONSES YEA PLAYS OUT U CONSISTENTLY IN RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW REALLY ON THERE'S A VERY LOW EXPECTATION OF RESPONSE AND THEN AS PEOPLE GET ATTACHED DEPENDING ON THEIR LEVEL OF ANXIETY IF THEY DON'T HEAR BACK FROM SOMEBODY REALLY QUICKLY WHERE THE MIND GOES IS I IS A VERY INTERESTING ASPECT YOU KNOW AR D YOU BECOME SUSPICIOUS YOU BECOME ANXIOUS CAN YOU STABLIZE YOUR OWN INTERNAL MILEU WHATD YOU WAR D YOU NEED TO SEE  NOT NOT NTHAT I COMING BACK I'D LOVE TO SEE A STUDY ON THAT SON YA YEH YEO THAT'S A GOOD ONE AND AND O O MY INTUITION SUGGEST THAT YOUR PREDICTION ABOUT THAT WOULD WOULD PAN OUT THEREOUD BE THEINSECURE THAT WOULD REALLY BE YIN GETTING UPSET IF THERE WERE IF THERE WERE NOT THAT IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE TEX I HAVE A FRIEND A FEMALE FRIEND WHO UM DELIBERATELY COTE AND COTE USING HER LANGUAGE TRAINS HER U PETENTIAL PARTNERS TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH A VARIABLE RESPONSE LATENCY BUT THEN I ASKED HER IF SHE'S COMFORTABLE WITH A VARIABLE RESPONSELAAND SHE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOTSO  THERE'S ANY SYMMETRY AT LEAST IN THAT CASE AM THIS IS ALMOST CERTAINLY A MORE RARE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT A I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT UNCONVENTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AM THESE DAYS A I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST BY VIRTUE OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA YOU HEAR MORE AND MORE ABOUT A MONOGAMISH A SUPPOSED TO MONOGAMOUS A AND VARIOUS FORMS OF APOLLYAMORY THAT MAY E MAY NOT INCLUDE THE AMORY PART A YOU KDON'T ASSES IN PERMISSION A BASED ON A SEASON CIRCUMSTANCE AND A PRIORINFIDELITIES LIKE OKA SOMEBODY HAD A MISHAP ERLY ON YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ONE A PASS SO TOS I GORAND YOU HEAR THIS KIND OF LANGUAGE GETTING THROWN AROUND ANA AND IT'S INTRIGUING TO ME BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS LIKE AN AN EFFORT TO A MY PASS SOME OF THE MORE A IF YOU WILL HARD WIRED OR AT LEAST CULTURALLY HARD WIRED ASPECTS OF MATE CHOICE IN SEXUAL PARTNER CHOICE YOU KNOW A ACKNOWLEDGING JEALOUSY BUT CONFRONTING IT BY ALLOWING YOUR PARTNER TO BE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE FOR INSTANCE A I I CONFESS I HAVE FRIENDS WO HAVE UN CONVENTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS I FRIENDS WITH CONVENTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS A ANY THOUGHTS ON THE POLLYAMRY IYET YET I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ON IT I HAVEN'T STUDIED IT EXTENSIVELY BUT AM I THINK THAT THE WAY I WOULD PHRASE IT IS THAT THEREIS AN ATTEMPT TO AM OVERCOME A CERTAIN EVOLVES AA FEATURES OF OUR MATING PSYCHOLOGY BUT OFTEN IN THE SERVICE OF OTHER ASPECTS OF REMATING PSYCHOLOGY SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THIS SO FOLK ABOUT POLLYAMERY FIRST OF ALL THER'S A SEX DIFFERENCE ON A OT ON AVERAGE THAT IS MEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO WANT TO INITIATE APOLLYAMEROUS RELATIONSHIP THAN WOMEN THERE ARE LOTS OF EXCEPTIONS AND I ACTUALLY NO OF A AT LEAST ONE EXCEPTION PERSONALLY FRIENDS FRIENDS OF MINE WHO WERE IN APOLYAMERAS RELATIONSHIP BUT THE MOTIVATION FOR MEN IS THAT EVOLVE DESIRE FOR SEXUAL VARIETY SO AA IT GIVES HIM ACCESS TO WIDER VARIETY OF SEX PARTNERS WHICH IS PART OF OUR EVOLVE SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY ESPECUALLY FOR MEN WOMEN ONE MOTIVATION A WOMEN ALSO HAVE A DESIRE FOR SEXUAL VARIETY ON AVERAGE TENDS NOT TO BE AS GREAT AS THAT OF MEN BUT ALSO HAVE IT BUT SOME WOMEN AGREE TO APOLLYAMOUS RELATIONSHIP AS A MATE RETENTION TACT THAT THAT IS THIS GUY IN ORDER TO KEEP EM SHE HAS TO AGREE TO THE RELATIONSHIP AND SO AND SO THE MOTIVATIONS FOR ENGAGING APOLYAMERY ARE SOMEWHAT SEX DIFFERENTIATED ON AVERAGE ON AVERAGE ON AVERAGE CURES LOTS OF EXCEPTION SO NOW WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL JEALOUSY THERE IS THIS RECOGNITION THAT THERE AN MI THE WAY THAT I WOULD FRAMD WIT THRESIST EVOLVED EMOTION WERE WE A A TRIGERS SEXUAL JEALOUSY SENOUR P ARTRAMMING SECT WERE IMAGINING YER PARTNER HAVING SEX OR BEFALLING IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND BUT INTERESTINGLY AND THERE HAVEN'T BEEN STUDIES ON THIS BUT I KNOW OF THIS ONE POLLYAMEROUS COUPLE WHERE THEY REPORTED TO ME A BOTH OF THEM REPORTING ME SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T BUT IT DOESN'T BOTHER HER AT ALL OF HER HUSBAND THEY'RE MARRIED HAS SEX WITH OTHER WOMEN SHE THEY ALLOW IT I THINK IT'S LIKE EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE THE DIFFERENT COUPLES HAVE DIFFERENT RULES A BUT ONE TIME SHE SAW HIM WALKING DOWN THE STREET HAND IN HAND AFFECTIONATELY WITH HA FORMER GIRL FRIEND AND SHE GOT EXTREMELY JEALOUSE SO BECAUSE IT SIGNALED AN EMOTION OL CONNECTION SO THE SEXUAL  ENVMOTHER THE EMOTIONAL DID SHE HAPPENED TO BE BY SEXUAL AND SHE A AND HER PARTNER SAID THAT IT REALLY UPSET HIM WHEN SHE SLEPT WITH OTHER MEN BUT IT WAS FINED IF SHE SLEP WITH OTHER WOMAN WHEN I THIN THET'S A FAIRLY COMMON THING THAT I AMONG THE MEN THAT I KNOW THAT ERE INPOLYAMEROUS RELATIONSHIPS THAT YET THAT'S A FAIRLY COMEYE YET SO HE KEPT TRYING TO N TH THIS THES INTERNESSING A MANIPULATIONS TRYING THE ENCOURAGE HER TO SLEEP WITH OTHER WOMEN BUT NOT WITH MEN AND IN HER CASE OF ENCOURAGING HIM NOT TO GET EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED WITH OTHER WOMEN BUT THE SEX WAS OUTKET SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IN THE MODERN ENVIRONMENT IN A WE WE HAVE A VERY RICH AND COMPLICATED EVOLVE MADING PSYCHOLOGY AND WHAT WERE DOING IN THESE NOVEL FORMS OR SEMI NOVEL CAUSE THESE THINGS HAVE A PRETTY DEEP HISTORY THEMSELVES A A THAT WE WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO MAXIIE SOME OF OUR EVOLVE DESIRES WHILE MEN WHILE KEEPING QUIESCENT OTHER REVOLVED ASPECTS OF OUR SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY LIKE JEALOUSY SO SATISFYING HER DESIRE FOR SEXUAL VARIETY BUT KEEPING JEALOUSY AT BAY AND DIFFERENT COUPLES DOE IN DIFFERENT WAYS O AS YOU AS YOU ALLUDED TO SO I KNOW ONE COUPLE WHERE LIVEIN LOS ANGULESS AND THE WOMEN FROM THE WOMAN SAID SHE GIVES HER HUSBAND PISION HAVE AN AFFAIR SLEEP WITH OTHER WOMEN AS LONG AS OUTSIDE OF THE CITY LIMITS OF ALET AN HAVIN THIS OTHER COUPLE WITS HAS TO BE THURSDAY NIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT TERIN INSTRAINTS O BUT THE CONSTRAITS AR R A SPECIFIC AND SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY TO THE RELATIONSHIP YET YET THER SPECIFIC IN AND AND OFTEN IN POLLYAMEROUS RELATIOUS PEOPLE TALK IT OUT AND AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT O WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE ON WHAT'S OUT ABOUNDS SO O BUT BUT IN A WAY I MEAN IT IN A WAY IT'S JUST YOU KNOW WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR EVOLVED SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY I DON'T THINK WHAT WE CAN DOS WE CAN ACTIVATE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF IT AND KEEP OTHERS QUIESCENT AND OM  AND THAT AND THAT'S ALL GOOD IN A IN A WAY WE WE DO IN THE MODERN ENVIRONMENTS I EVEN TO TAKE IT OUTSIDE A POLYAMERY A PONOGRAPHY A WIDELY CON UMED IN ANAT PROOGRAPHY UWHAT WHAT IS THAT DO WHETHERE IS A BIG SEX DIFFERENT THEIR MEN TEND TO CONSUME AN A LOT MORE THAN WOMEN THE FORMS OF THE PRONOGRAPHYER ARE DIFFERENT BUT IN A WAY THE PRONOGRAPHY WHAT IT DOES IS IT PARISITIZE MEN'S EVOLVED DESIRE FOR SEXUAL VARIETIES SO THEY CAN IN SOME IN SOME SENSE PSYCHOLOGICALLY EXPERIENCE SEXUAL DISTHEA VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WOMEN SEXUALLY WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING BY JUST LOOKING AT THEIR COMPUTER SCREEN AND SO IN A WAY WHAT YOU ANOTHER WAY OF PHRASING AT IS THAT WE CREATE MODERN NOVEL CULTURAL INVENTIONS IN WAYS THAT SATISFY OR EVOLVED DESIRES IN OUR EVOLVE SEXUAL DESIRES THAT'S INTERESTING WITH THE UM OF EXPLOSION OF I OF UNLINE PRONAGY HAVE A COLLEAGUE GET STAMFORD UM IN PSYCHIATRY ON OLEMPKI WHO STUDIES THE DOPA MEAN SYSTEM AND UM SHE MENTION TWO THINGS OF INTEREST ONE IS THAT U NOT ONLY AS THEIR TREMENDOUS VARIETY OF OF A EXPERIENCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE TO VIEW IN PRONOGRAPHY BUT THE IN THE INTENSITY IS ALSO QUITE HI UM SO MUCH SO THAT AT LEAST FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE OBSERVING A LOT OF PRONOGRAPHY IT'S POSSIBLE IN THEIR TUDIES LOOKING AT THIS NOW THAT THEIR BRAIN CIRCUITS BECOME WIRE TO OBSERVING SEXUAL ACTS AS SUPPOSED TO BEING ENGAGED IN THEM WHICH CAN BE EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC UM SO IT'S A IT'S A SHARP BLADE SO TO SPEAK AM THI PONOGRAPHY THING IT ISN'T WHAT IT ONCE WAS IN ITS EVOLVING QUICKLY A VERY INTERESTING A SO HOW SHOULD ONE FRAME ALL THIS SO I IMAGINE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LISTENING ARE IN RELATIONSHIPS OR OR WOULD WOULD HOPE TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP UM YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ARE SELECTING FOR CONSCIOUSLY OR SUBCONSCIOUSLY A IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR COMMON THEMES IT'S A PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL UM ATTRACTIVE AND ATTRACTED UM E PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR STABILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS SO WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT SECURITY OFTEN TIMES I THINK OF THIS KIND OF WARM OXYTOS AN CERE TONE AND A LIKE THING BUT BAT THIS MATE VALUE THING SEEMS SO POWERFUL IN ALL THIS ASSESSING MATE VALUE SO HOW OBJECTIVE ARE PEOPLE ABOUT ASSESSING THEIR OWN AM VALUE IN TERMS OF FINDING SECURING AND OVERTIME MAINTAINING OUR RELATIONSHIP SECURING IS DYNAMIC BECAUSE PEOPLE AGE AT DIFFERENT RATES UM IS THERE A A A IN OBJECTIVE METRIC OF THI STUFF I GUESS YOU GET A LOT OF STATISTICS ABOUT SOMEBODY'S IMAGE AND YOU FIGHT COME UP WITH AVAUT AT  AVERAGE VALUE BASED ON THE POPULATION BUT HOW SHOULD PEOPLE ASSESS THEMSELVES BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE FEATURES THAT WOULD BE VERY POWERFUL FOR LEADING TO HAPPINESS OF OF GOOD PARTNER SELECTION THAT STABLE UM WERE YOU ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO RESORT TO THESE MACCAVILIAN OR DIABOLICAL OR ANYTHSE OTHER STRAGIES WOULD BE TO BE VERY HONEST WITH ONESELF AND HOW DOES ON' DO THAT O GREAT QUESTIONS A AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE SCIENCE HAS ALL ALL THE ANSWERS SO A COUPLE THINGS SO ONE IS THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD AT SELF ASESSING MATE VALUE A AND EVEN A SELF ESTEEM HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO BE ONE INTERNAL A MONITERING DEVICE THAT TRACTS MADE VALUE SO WE GET A PROMOTION AT WORK OR WE GET ARISINST AS WE FEEL AN ELEVATED SENSE OF SELF ESTEEM WE GET FIRE WE GET REJECTED WE GET OSTRCISES OURSELF ESTEEM PLUMETS SO ON SO OURSELF A VALUATION I THINK DOES TRACT MATE VALUE TO SOME EXTEND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO OVER ESTIMATE THEIR ATE VALUE PEOPLE HINARCICISM AR PARTULAR IN PARTICULAR A AND SOME PEOPLE UNDER ESTIMATE THEIR ATE VALUE AANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT IS THAT THEREIS CONSENTIAL MATE VALUE SO THAT IS IF YOU ASKD A GROUP OF A HUNDRED PEOPLE YOU KNOW THERE'S FAIR AMOUNTICAN SENSES THAT THIS PERSONS IN MATE THAT PERSONS AS SIX BUT THERE ARE ALSO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN MATE VALUE SO ONE EXAMPLE AS I KNOW WOMAN WHOS A PROFESSOR AND SHE PLACES A HIGH PREMIUM ON GUISE WHO ARE DEEPLY STEEPED IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE WHICH SHE IS SO THAT SHE CAN HAVE INDEPT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RUSSIAN LITERATURE NOTE TO YOUNG MEN LEARN RUSSIAN LITERATURE WEL WELL BUT THIS IS HIGH AND IT'S A DIMENSION OF MATE VALUE THIS IMPORTANT FOR HERS BUT PROBABLY NOT IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AND SO WHERE IS OTHER PEOPLE WHAT SAY MIGHT BE LESS AT YOUR INTO FOOTBALL OR A WERE SOME SPORT THAN AND AOTHER PARTNOR THINK SPORTS ARE STUPID YOU KNOW THEN THAT'S YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHOSE ALSO INDISPORTS CAN BE HIGHER IN MATE VALUE FOR YOU SO THERE THESE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN COMPONISIMATE A WHICH IS GOOD CAUSE THAT MEANS IF EVERY ONE WERE GOING AFTER THE SAME PEOPLE AND THERE WAS TOTAL CONSENSES ON MATE VALUE THAN THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF A A MATELESS PEOPLE AND A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD A LOT OF DISSATISFIED PEOPLE SO SO AT BOTH ARE IMPORTANT THE CONSENTIAL ASPECTS AND THE INDIVIDUALLY DIFFERENT DIFFERENTIATED COMPONENTS OF OF MATE VALUE A BUT AIN TERMS OF ACCURACY OF ASSESSMEN IT IT'S THERE ARE NOT NO GOOD MEASURES SCIENTIFICALLY TO TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S SUFFICIENTLY COMPLICATED SO I MENTION YOU KNOW WEVE MENTION MAY BE HA MAY BE A DOZEN DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF MATE VALUE A PHYSICAL ATTRACT IN THIS KINDEST EMOTIONAL STABILITY HEALTH STATUS ET CETERA A AND  AND AND THESE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES SO I TEACH A COURSE ON PSYCHOLOGY OF HUMAN MATING AND I ASK THE PEOPLE IT'S A LARGE COURSE COUPLE UNDER PEOPLE TELL ME WHAT DO WOMEN WANT IN A MATE AND SO I STARTET WITH THE BLACKBOARD THIS IS BACK IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN THERE AS A BLACKBOARD A PIECE OF SHOCK THEY SAY I WANT A MATE WHO HAS A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOURS AR RIGHT SENSE OF HUMOUR INTELLIGENT RIGHT HIM TIME AND SO I GO THROUGH THIS AND I GO THROUGH FIVE BLACKBOARDS AND THEN I RUN OUT OF SPACE OVER WHAT WOMEN WANT I DO THE SAME FOR MEN AND MEN COUNT O RUN OUT OF SPACE AFTER ABOUT ABLACKBOARD AND THE HALF BUT BUT WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS THAT THESE QUALITIES ARE LARGE IN NUMBER AND COMPLICATED IN NATURE SO OU SAY YOU WANT A GUY WHO'S A NICE AND GENEROUS IT'S A YAV SO LIKE A GUY WHO AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH TAKES HIS WHOLE PACHECK AND GIVES IT TO THE THE WHY KNOW A HOMELESS PERSON WELL KNOW NOT THAT GENEROUS AN  GENEROUS TOWARD ME BUT NOT TOR IT EVERYONE ELSE NICE IN GENERAL BUT NOT SO NICE THAT THEY'RE GETTING EXPLOITED SO OR EVEN IN ANOTHER SOMETHING YOU CAN'T BE TOO HEALTHY SO PEOPLE IT THAT'S UNITO MENTIONAL BUT YOU WANT A GUI WOMEN LANT A GOT WHOSE CONFIDENT BUT NOT TOO CONFIDENT AND  CAUSE TOO CONFIDENT WOMEANNGS EITHER ARROGANT OR SICISTIC OR NOT SUFFICIENTLY MANIPULABLE I SO M A SO ENEMAS MY POINT IS THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF MATE VALUE AND THAT THEY VERY IN AA MOUNT SO AS NOT JUST LISTING THE QUALITIES IN SUMMING A MOP THEYVOUT VERY IN AMOUNT I'S A VERY COMPLICATED A ENDEAVOUR TO ASSESS ACCURATELY BUT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A GOOD INTUITIVE SENSE AF PEOPLE'S RELATIVE MATE VALUE SPECIALLY IF YOU YOU'RE IN A GROUP AND YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THEM FOR A LONG TIME AND ONE INDICATION IS A AGAIN THAT ATTENTION STRUCTURE HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLEREALLY WANT A MATE WITH THIS PERSON THAT'S A GOOD CUE THAT THEY'RE HIGH AN MATE VALUE NOBODY WANTS TO MATE WITH YOU THEN CUE THAT YOUR LOW IN MATE VALUE WIN'S ME OF THE TIME WHEN NA ONE IS TRYING TO DECIDE WHO'TO ASK TO THE PROM YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A COMPLICATED ACESSMENT BASED ON WHO ONE WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH WHETHER NOT YOUR ALREADY PARTNER WHO WOULD SAY YES WHO WOULD SAY NO BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A RISK IN REJECTION TOO BECAUSE THAT O IF I'M GUESSING CORRECTLY WOULD WOULD CAN LOWER ONE'S OWN PERCEIVED MATE YOU VAL HE REJECTED RIGHT FREQUENCY OF REJECTIONS IPROBABLY DOESN'T LEND ITSELF WELL TO INCREASING MATE A ONE'S ON VIEW OF THEIR MATE VALUE I WHICH O WHICH IS WHY WHY MANY GUIDES HAVE WHAT I CALL A MADING ANXIETY THAT IS THEY THEY DON'T APPROACH HIM BECAUSE THEY RISK GETTING SHOT DOWN THEY'RE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THAT NUMBER A IN THET BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DATA RIHT YET VERY BER'S THAT IT'S BUT IT IT'S IT'S A IIN BACK FIRES IN THE MODERN ENVIRONMENT SO SO THERE'S A FAMOUS PSYCHOLOGIST ALBERT ELLUS WHO HAD MADING ANXIETY AND HE ASSIGNED HIMSELF THE TASK O APPROACHING ASKING LIKE I C AN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE NUMBER WAS BUT A SAY FIFTY WOMEN OUT ON DATES HE LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY SO AS THEY LOT OF WOMEN HE COULD TO STAND STILL IN THE ASTERING A N A AND THE ASSIGNS OF LIKE ASK FIFTY WOMEN ON A DATE YOU KNOW EVERY E EVERY WEEK AND HE SAID AFTER TWO WEEKS HAS MADE N ANXIETY TDISAPPEAR WITH MOST OF THEM SAIT BAZ OFF CREEP A BUT HED SID OPO ACTON GETTING REJECTED DIDN'T CAUSE MY WORLD TE COLLAPSE AND TH ACTURY WAS A CANT SO HE KIND OF INNURED HIMSELF TO THIS REJECTION AND SO ON IT ENDED UP BY THE END THAT HAVE DEING QUITE WELL IN HIS MATING LIFE ANOTHER POINT FOR COGNY OF BEHAVIAL DISENSES ATION YES  EXACTLY HE DERAND THE EXPERIMENT  JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS EALLY AR YOU MENTIONED SELF DECEPTION BASE DECEPTION UM AND WE'RE SOMETHING OF THAT SORT SELF DECEPTION  THAT PEOPLE AREN'T ALWAYS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOMEBODY ELSE OF SOMETHING THAT SECRETLY THEY KNOW ISN'T TRUE BUT THAT THEY DECEIVE THEMSELVES  I YO TELISH ON THAT A LITTLE AT SO BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY HTHIS HYPOTHESIS IS A THE FAMOUS EVOLUTIONARY BILOGIST ROBERT TRIVERS FIRST ADVANCE THIS HYPOTHESIS AND THE PREFACE A NINETEEN A SEVENTY SIX TO DOCKIN'S BOOK THE SELFISH CEEN AND TH ANY SUBSEQUENTLY WRITTEN A WRITTEN MORE ABOUT IT A BUTH IN SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE AND IN A MORE POPULAR BOOK  BUT THE IDEAS THAT IF A COOR IDEAS THAT SUCCESSFUL DECEPTION IS FACILITATED BY SELF DECEPTION SO IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT AN TH ACTS THEN YOU'REGING TO BE A MORE SUCCESSFUL SALESMEN TO CONVINCE OTHER PEOPLE OF ACTS O IF YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE LETS SAY A TEN AND MATE VALUE YOU TRULY BELIEVE IT EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT IMEN TO HAVE A MORE SUCCESSFUL TIME CONVINCING YOU THAT I AM AS WELL AND SO THE HYPOTHESIS IS BASICALLY THAT PEOPLE SELF DECEIVE IN ORDER TO A INCREASE THE EFFECTIVNESS OF OF ACTUAL DECEPTION  A BUT I THINK THAT THEARE PEOPLE WHO ON R OR OR SO IN ONE OTHER TIMENTION I'LL MENTION TO IS THAT AS THAT ANIMALS OFTEN TAKE EACH OTHER AT OUR OWN WORD FOR THINKS SO IF WE'RE SELF CONFIDENT PEOPLE ASSUNE THAT WE MUST HAVE THE GOODS TO BACK UP THAT SELF CONFIDENCE IF WE'RE A QUIVERING MASS OF INSECURITY PEOPLE BELIEVE WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE GOODS TO BACK UP ANYTHING YOU KNOW AND SO PEOPLE USE OTHER PEOPLE'S DISPLAYS OF THEIR SELF CONFIDENCE AS A CUE TO TO THEIR GOODS AND IT'S GENT IN GENERAL PRETTY RELIABLE CUBE BUT THAN THEIR OVER ESTIMATES AN UNDER ESTIMATES AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LIKE WITH NARCISISM YET WE SEE THE SUITH THE JOB CANDIDATES YOU KNOW YE YOU YOU ARE TAUGHT TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THE APPLICATION AND CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS BUT ULTIMATELY  YOU CONSIDER THAT ALSO IN LIGHT OF YOU KNOW HOW FIRMLY SOME ONE BELIEVES IN THE VISION OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING TO THE PROFESSION AND U AND TOT'S A I THINK O LARGELIEST OF CONSCIOUS PROCESS BEING AWARE OF IT CAN BE HELPFUL A BUT NOW WHEN SOMEBODY'S CONVIDENT YOU TAND TO THINK THEY'RE GOIN TO GET WHERE THEY SAY THEY'RE OING TO GO AND IT AND IT ACTS AS A BIT OF A OF A HURISTIC FOR NOT MEETING THE IMPULSES THAT ONE THEN DOESN'T NEED TO GO THAT ALL THE INFORMATION QUITE AS CAREFULLY BUT IF I GESS IF ONE IS AWARE OF IT THAN YOU KNOW TO TO DIG DEEPER IN OT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF DECEPTION GOING  E YE YE WELL AND AND A YOU KNOW AND AND WA SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT EARLIER PEOPLE HIHON PSYCHOPATHY ARE VERY GOOD AT A AT DECEPTION I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE GOOD SELF DECECTION OR WHETHER THEYRE JUST REALLY GOOD DECEIVERS AN  SO  BUT THEY CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE AND AAOUT IN CALIFORNIA OU KNOW YOUOU LIVE OUT IN CALIFORNIA I'M SURE YOU SENOR FAIR SHARE OF A CASES LIKE THAT OH YE I THINK A INTO A CROSS TO DAY'S DISCUSSION AND VARIOUS EXAMPLES POP TO MIND OF AF SEEN THESE FEATURES AND HUMANS IT'S SO INTERESTING I I FIND THE WORK THAT YOU DO INCREDIBLY INTERESTING I THINK THIS FIELD OF EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY IS FASCINATING AND AND M I HOPE I I SAID IT BEFORE BAT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN I FEEL LIKE NOURA SCIENCE AND EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY ARE ANIDGING TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE A THEY MERGE IN IN SOME A FORMAL WAY I MIN THERE IS THE WORK FOR INSTANCE ON POLYGAMIS FERSS MONOTOMIUSTS PRAIRIEVOLS AND LEVELS OF THESE OPPRESING BUT IT'S A BIG LEAP TO GO FROM THESE OPPRESSING IN A PRAIRIE OF ALL I KNOW DUSTRESPECT TO THAT BEAUTIFUL WORK BUT TO HUMANS AND SAY AL VASE OPPRESSING IN HAIL IS ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU MONOGNAMIS OR SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S A THA PRI GET THE DIRECTION THE EFFECTOR ON BUT YU YOU GET TH YE YE N OT YOUR ABSOLY RIGHT AND AND I THINK IT IT WILL HAPPEN I THINK IT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN AND AND IT WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE A GETTING AT THE NAROU SCIENCE IS GETTING AT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS THAT AR DRIVING THE PROCESS SO YOU KNOW WHAT AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE BRINGS TO BEAR IS IS EVOLV FUNCTION A AND ULTIMATE EXPLANATION THE SELECTIVE FORCES THAT CREATED ADAPTATIONS THE FUNCTIONS OF THOSE ADAPTATIONS AND THE NAROU SCIENCE BRINGS WOR WHAT IS THE UNDERLYING MACHINERY THAT THESE MECHANISMS ARE INSTANTIATED IN I WONDERFUL TO COLLABORATE SOME DAY MAY WE WILL DO A BRAINIMMAGING STUDY ON JEALOUSY OR SOMETHING IN A I DONONN'T THROW IT YOU'RE YOU'RE THE PSYCHOLOGIES YOU WOULD COME UP WITH THE BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A I'M CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE

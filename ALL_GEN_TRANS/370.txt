WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAMCONCAS NTE US SCIENCE  SCIENCE BASE TOOLE FORLI   I MENTER HUBERMEN AND ON ROPROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY WE ARE DISCUSSING TOOLS FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH I WILL INCLUDE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TAKEN FROM THE GUEST EPISODE THAT I DID WITH DOCTOR LISA FELDMAN BERRET WHO IS A PSYCHOLOGIST AND NEURO SCIENTIST WHOSE LABORATORY FOCUSES ON MOOD AND EMOTIONS DURING THAT EPISODE SHE MENTION SEVERAL IMPORTANT TOOLS THAT I DO BELIEVE EVERYBODY SHOULD APPLY THAT INDEED I'VE BEEN APPLYING TO MY OWN LIFE AND HAVE FOUND TO BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL I WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC RESEARCH ARTICLES THOSE TOOLS ARE BASED ON WHICH WERE NOT COVERED IN THE PODCAST WITH LESO I WILL ALSO DISCUSS TOOLS GLEAN FROM THE FOUR EPISODE SERIES THAT I DID ON MENTAL HEALTH WITH DOCTOR PAULCONTI WHO IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR SPECIALIZING IN PSYCHIETRY AND THAT EPISODE AS SOME OF YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW FOCUSED ON MENTAL HEALTH AND THE SELF AS WELL AS RELATIONSHIPS AND IT INCLUDED A DEEP DISCUSSION OF WHAT IS THE SELF WE TALKED ABOUT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND THE CONSCIOUS MIND AND WE ALSO COVERED A LOT OF TOOLS FOR UNDERSTANDING ONESELF BOTH WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THERAPY BUT ALSO WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO ALONE AND THAT REQUIRE ZERO COST IN ADDITION WE TALKED ABOUT TOOLS FOR IMPROVING RELATIONSHIPS WE TALKED ABOUT FIRST PRINCIPLES OF SELF CARE SO I WILL PROVIDE HIGHLIGHTS AND TAKE AWAYS OF THOSE TOOLS DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE AND THIRDLY I'LL INCLUDE TOOLS WHAT WE OFTEN REFERD TO AS PROTOCALS GLEANED FROM SOME RECENT PUBLICATIONS INDEED PUBLICATIONS THAT CAME OUT AS RECENTLY AS TWO WEEKS AGO WHICH REALLY EMPHASIZE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO THAT AGAIN OUR ZERO COST THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN QUALITY PURREVIEWED RESEARCH TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE A REGULAR LISTENER OF THIS PODCAST YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH MY NEGRLY CONSTAN REMINDER THAT PEOPLE SHOULD VIEW MORNING SUNLIGHT AND AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT IN A YOU CAN'T TO EMBRACE SOME ALTERNATIVES LIKE LOOKING AT BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT ALTHOUGH SUNLIGHT IS BEST WELL THERE WAS A RECENT PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL NATURE MENTAL HEALTH AND EXCELLENT JOURNAL FOCUSING ON NOT JUST THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF VIEWING LIGHT AT THOSE TIMES OF DAY AND INDEED THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT ALSO THE INDEPENDENT AND POSITIVE EFFECTS OF BEING IN DARKNESS FOR SIXTY EIGHT HOURS EVERY NIGHT THAT'S RIGHT NOT ONLY IS LIGHT DURING THE DAY CORRELATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES BUT DARKNESS AT NIGHT THAT IS AVOIDING LIGHTS NOT JUST BRIGHT LIGHTS BUT LIGHTS FOR UP TO EIGHT HOURS AT CERTAIN PERIODS OF YOUR TWENTY FOUR HOURS CIRCADIAN CYCLE HAS BEEN CORRELATED WITH IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND INDEED HAS BEEN SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY OFFSET CERTAIN NEGATIVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES THIS IS A SPECTACULAR STUDY AGAIN IT INVOLVED A ENORMOUS NUMBER OF RESEARCH SUBJECTS MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND RESEARCH SUBJECTS AND IT TOUCHES ON A LARGE NUMBER OF ACTIONABLE PROTOCOLS THAT I 'VE JUSTSTEALED DOWN TO JUST ONE OR TWO THINGS THAT ALL OF US CAN EASILY DO TO IMPROVE OUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORTS TO BRING ZERI COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SIGNS RELATED TOOLS TO THE JENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I' LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS PLUNGE PLUNGE MAKES WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE MOST VERSATILE AT HOME SELF COOLING COL PLUNGE FOR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IHAVE COVERED THE TOPIC OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS PODCASTINDEED WE DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND WHAT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE RESEARCH LITERATURE IS THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN INDUCE DRUMMATIC POSITIVE SHIFTS IN SO CALLED CATICOLAMINES THAT IS DOPEMING NORUPINEFFERON AND EPINEFFORT THIS IS A SMALL COLLECTION OF MOLECULES THAT ARE RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND BODY W EN WE DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND THAT SUBJECTIVELY LEAD TO GREATLY ENHANCED FEELINGS OF MOOD ALERTNESS AND FOCUS FOR MANY HOURS AFTERWARDS THAT'S PERHAPS THE BEST SUBSTANTIATED REASON AND THE MOST POPULAR REASON WHY PEOPLE WHO GET INTO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE NO PUN INTENDED CONTINUE TO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ON A CONSISTENT BASIS PLUNGE USES A POWERFUL AND VERY EASY TO USE COOLING FILTRATION AND SINITATION UNIT TO GIVE YOU ACCESS TO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IN CLEAN WATER WHENEVER YOU WANT I'VE USED TO PLUNGE FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND I REALLY LIKE IT BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IT CAN USE A STANDARD OUTLET YOU DON'T HAVE TO MODIFY THE ELECTRICITY IN YOUR HOME OR YARD AND IT'S VERY EASY TO CLEAN IN FACT IT STAYS CLEAN FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHICH MAKES IT VERY EASY TO MAINTAIN AS WELL PLUNGE HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODELS

SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKES SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT SLEEP THAT IS GETTING ENOUGH QUALITY SLEEP ON A CONSISTENT BASIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE NOW ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS TO GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE NIGHT SLEEP IS TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY SLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE NEEDS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP CONTROLLING THE TEMPERTURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IS MADE EXTREMELY EASY IT LEEP MATTRESS COVERS ALLOW YOU TO PROGRAM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMEN AT THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF YOUR NIGHT IT CAN EVEN DIVIDE THE TEMPERATURE ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE BED FOR DIFFERENT PEEPLE IT ALSO AS SLEEP TRACKING FACITY WILL TLL YOU HOW MUCH SLOWWAVE SLEEP AND RAPID I MOVE AND SLEEP YOU'RE GETTING AND REALLY HELP YOU DI L IN THE EXACT PERAMENERS YOU CAN GET THE BEST POSSIBLE NIGHT SLEEP

MINDFULNESS TRAININGS YOGANEDRA SESSIONS AND ANESTY AR NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST PROTOCALS I START USING THE WAKING UP AP A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN DOING REGULAR MEDITATION SINCE MY TEENS AND I STAR DOING YOGANEDRA ABOUT A DECATE AGO MY DAD MENTION TO ME THAT HE HAD FOUND AN AP TUR NOT TO BE THE WAKING UP AP WHICH COULD TEACH YOU MEDITATIONS OF DIFFERENT DURATIONS AND THAT HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDITATIONS TO PLACE THE BRAIN AND BODY INTO DIFFERENT STATES AND THAT HE LIKED IT VERY MUCH SO I GAVE THE WAKING UP APATRY AND I TOO FOUND IT TO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL BECAUSE SOMETIMES I ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO MEDITATE OTHER TIMES I'VE LONGER TO MEDITATE AND INDEED I LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN EXPLORE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDITATION TO BRING ABOUT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS BUT ALSO TO PLACE MY BRAIN AND BODY INTO LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF STATES DEPENDING ON WHICH MEDITATION I DO I ALSO LOVE THAT THE WAKING UPAP HAS LOTS OF DFFERENT TYPES OF YOGANEDRA SESSIONS THOSE YOU DON'T KNOW YOGANEDRA IS A PROCESS OF LYING VERY STILL BUT KEEPING AN ACTIVE MIND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN MOST MEDITATIONS AND THERE'S EXCELLENT SCIENTIFIC DATA TO SHOW THAT YOGANEDRA AND SOMETHING SIMILAR TO IT CALL NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST OR AN ES TIAR CAN GREATLY RESTORE LEVELS OF COGNIVE AND PHYSICAL ENERGY EVEN WITH JUST A SHORT TEN MINUTES SESSION IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THE WAKING UP AP YOU CAN GO TO WAKING UP DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMAN AND ACS ESS A FREE THIRTY DAY TRIAL AGAIN THAT'S WAKING UP DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO ACCS ESS A FREE THIRTY DAY TRIAL O KET LET'S TALK ABOUT TOOLS FOR IMPROVING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH I THIN GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THESE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOPICS FOR EVERY ONE NUTJUS TO KNOW ABOUT BUT IN MY OPINION ALSO FOR PEOPLE TO IMPLEMENT AND THE REASON IS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN A WORLD WIDE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND WHILE WE COULD DEBATE THE REASON WHY WE ARE IN A WORLD WIDE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES IT'S VERY VERY CLEAR THAT MOOD DISORDERS AND CHALLENGES WITH MENTAL HEALTH ABOUND AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF MOOD DISORDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH EVERYTHING FROM TALCTHERAPY WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST OR SOCIAL WORKER PRESCRIPTION DRUG TREATMENTS THEIR NEUTRITIONAL APPROACHES SEMMATIC APPROACHES I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S VALUE IN ALL OF THESE APPROACHES WHAT TENDS TO MATTER IN TERMS OF WHAT SORTS OF TOOLS AND APPROACHES ONE ADOPTS INCLUDES BOTH ACCESS SO WHETHER NOT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THESE TYPOTHERAPIES WHETHER NOT THEY CAN AFFORD THEM ON A CONSISTENT BASIS AND ALSO OF COURSE THE SEVERITY OF THE MOOD OR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER AND I'D BE REMISS OF COURSE IF I DIDN'T MAKE THE STATEMENT AND I DON'T SAY THIS JUST TO PROTECT ME I ALSO SAY THIS TO PROTECT ALL OF YOU AN THOSE THAT YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOURSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE HAVING A SERIOUS MOOD OR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER PLEASE DO SEEK OUT HEALP FROM A LICENSE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST OR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL WHOSE QUALIFY TO HEALP YOU IN THAT REGARD WITH THAT SAID WE CAN NOW HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT TOOLS AND PROTOCALS FOR ENHANCING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH THAT TRULY APPLIED TO EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF AGE TO START OFF I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND HANSOMENT THAT WAS DISCUSSED BOTH IN THE GUEST EPISODE WITH DOCTOR LISA FELDMAN BEAR IT AS WELL AS IN THE GUESTS SERIES WITH DOCTOR PAULCANTI AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT DOCTOR PALCANTI REFERRED TO AS THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF SELF CARE OR MENTAL HEALTH THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF SELF CARE INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO TAKING EXCELLENT CARE OF ONE'S BY OLOGY WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES BOTH THE MIND AND THE BODY AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS VERY SIMPLE AND ACTIONABLE AVE DISSTILLED OUT WHAT I REFERRD TO AS THE BIG SIX I'VE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO THESE AS THE SIX MAJOR PILLARS OF HEALTH BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AS WELL AS PERFORMANCE FOR THAT MATTER BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH WE ABSOLUTELY CAN'T DISCARD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OUR BIOLOGY THAT IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR NORMAL BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION AND INDEED ENHANCING THE PRODUCTION OF SPECIFIC NOR TRANSMITTERS AND REMODULATORS THAT WE ARE OPTIMIZING YES I USE THE WORD OPTIMIZING THE FUNCTION OF OUR SO CALLED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ASPECT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT'S HUMMING IN THE BACKGROUND ALL THE TIME IT'S OPERATING UNCONSCIOUSLY TO REGULATE OUR SLEEP WAKE CYCLES ITS REGULATING HOW WELL OR POORLY WE REACT TO THINGS ITS REGULATING HOW MUCH DOPAMINE SERETONAN A PINEPERIN A SEAT OF COLLING WE ARE PRODUCING ALL OF THE STUFF IS HUMMING IN THE BACKGROUND AND SETS THE STAGE FOR ALL THE CONSCIOUS WORK THAT WE MIGHT PUT TO FOR INSTANCE TRYN UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR LIFE NARRATIVE IS WHAT OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DOING WHAT SORTS OF DEFENCES IT MIGHT PRODUCING ALL OF THE SORT OF HIGH LEVEL AND DIRECTED WORK THAT WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LOBIT LATER EXIST ON A BACKGROUND OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION OF NER TRANSMITTER PRODUCTION OF HORMONE PRODUCTION NOT JUST TESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN BUT THINGS LIKE CARTERS ALL PROLACTIN AND ON AND ON SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF OUR GOAL IS TO BE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MOOD GIVEN OUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE MENTAL HEALTH GIVEN OUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO IMPROVE OUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME THAT WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT I'M REFERRING TO HEAR AS THE BIG SIX OR THE SIX PILLARS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND THOSE ARE JUST TO LIST THEM OFF THEN I'LL GOINTO A LUMIT MORE DETAIL SLEEP SUNLIGHT ALTHOUGH I K TO MODIFY SUNLIGHT BECAUSE BASED ON SOME NEW DATA THAT JUST CAME OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I'D LIKE TO NOW MAKE THAT SECOND PILLAR NOT SUNLIGHT BUT LIGHT SLASH DARK SO WE GET EVEN JUST THINK ABOUT IT AS A LIGHT WHEN AND HOW MUCH LIGHT YOU GET BUT WHAT YOU'LL SOON LEARN IS THAT HOW MUCH DARK YOU GET IS ALSO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO WE'VE GOT SLEEP LIGHT MOVEMENT IS THE THIRD NUTRITION SOCIAL CONNECTION AND STRESS CONTROL NOW THESE ARE TOPICS THAT I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT EXTENSIVELY ON PREVIOUS HUBERMAN LABPODCAST EPISODES SO I DON'T WANT TO GOING TO A DEEP DIVE OF EACH OF THESE SIX PILLARS RIGHT NOW BUT I AM GOING TO JUST GIVE YOU A FEW HIGH LIGHTS OF EACH AND THEN OF COURSE WE WILL PROVIDE LINKS IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS FOR WHICH YOU CAN GO ON THE DEEP DIVE IF YOU LIKE AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT IF YOU EVER HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS OR TOOLS AND YOUR SEEKING THOSE OUT OR PREVIOUS EPISODES OR SPECIFIC TIME STAMPS OF PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THIS PODCAST YOU CAN GO TO OUR NEWLY REVAMPED HUBERMAN LABDOC COM WEBSIGHT AND PUT ANY TOPIC OF INTEREST OR EVEN SEVERAL TOPICS OF INTEREST INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION AND IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE VERY SPECIFIC TIME STAMPS AND OTHER RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THOSE TOPICS SO I'M GOING TO GOING TO A FEW OF THE KEY BULLET POINTS ABOUT EACH OF THE SIX PILLARS OR WHAT I ALSO REFER TO AS THE BIG SIX OF SELF CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH AGAIN THIS IS A NECESSRY LIST BUT IS NOT SUFFICIENT AGAIN NECESSARY TO DO THESE THINGS EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS INDEED EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH BUT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT MEANS YOU STILL NEED TO DO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF DIRECTED APPROACHES TAT IMPROVING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH IF YOU ARE TO COINCL OPTIMIZE YOUR MOOD AND MENTAL HALTH OR IF YOU ARE LET'S JUST SAY TRYING TO CONSTANTLY IMPROVE YOUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH BUT THESE ARE THE NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT PILLARS OF MENTAL HEALTH SO IUNDER THE HEADING OF SLEEP IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE NEED BETWEEN SIX TO EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT SOME PEOPLE CAN GET AWAY WITH FIVE SOME PEOPLE NEED AS MUCH AS NINE OR TEN CERTAINLY GROWING KIDS BABIES TEAN AGERS AND THOSE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM SOME SORT OF ILLNESS ARE GOING TO NEED MORE AS MUCH AS NINE TEN MADE EVEN TWELVE HOURS OF SLEEP PERNIGHT HOWEVER MOST PEOPLE DO WELL TO GET SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX AND EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO EXPERIMENT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU NOW ONE THING I HEARD RECENTLY SO I CAN'T CLAIM THIS AS AN ORIGINAL IDEA BUT THAT I THINK I'S A REALLY GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT SLEEP IS THAT SLEEP MUCH LIKE PHYSICAL FITNESS IS SOME THING THAT WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY BE WORKING ON IT'S NOT THE SORT OF THING HERE YOU CAN GET A GREAT NIGHT'S SLEEP ONE NIGHT AND THEN THE NEXT NIGHT JUST COUND LET ALL THE PROTOCALLS GO AND EXPECT TO GET A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NOURADIC ABOUT GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP INDEED I DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD STRIVE TO GET ENOUGH QUALITES SLEEP AS MANY OF THE NIGHTS OF OUR LIFE IS POSSIBLE AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT HOPEFULLY IT'S FOR GOOD REASONS BUT OF COURSE THINGS HAPPEN IN LIFE RAISING KIDS OFE EMERGENCIES ALL NIGHT ER'S TO STUDIES WHO CAN MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT BEST POSSIBLE GRATE ON EXAM ET CETERA ET CETERA BUT WE SHOULD ALL STRIVE TO GET THE BEST QUALITIES SLEEP THAT WE CAN AND AS MUCH OF IT MOST NIGHTS OF OUR LIVES SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT SLEEP AS A PROCESS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE JUST LIKE FITNESS AND I DON'T SAY THAT TO OVERWHELM YOU I SAY THAT SO THAT IF ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT YOU GET A POOR NIGHT SLEEP YOU DON'T STRESS THAT TOO MUCH YOU JUST GET RIGHT BACK ON THE WAGON AND YOU TRING GET THE BEST POSSIBLE NIGHT SLEEP THE NEXT NIGHT AND THE NEXT NIGHT AND THE NEXT NIGHT MUCH LIKE FITNESS THERE'S NO TEN WEEK PROGRAMME THAT'S GOING TO TRANSFORM YOUR PHYSICAL FITNESS FOR EVER EH  JUST LIKE THERE'S NO SLEEP PROGRAME THAT'S GOING TO TRANSFORM YOUR SLEEP FOR EVER IT'S A DAILY OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY NIGHTLY INVESTMENT ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO POSITIIVELY IMPACT YOUR SLEEP OR PERHAPS DAMAGE YOUR SLEEP ARE THINGS THAT YOU DO DURING THE DAYTIME RIGHT SO AVOID THAT CAFFINE TOO LATE IN THE DAY GET THAT MORNING SUNLIGHT AND ON AND ON BUT IF YOU SLEEP AS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY INVESTING IN AND IT IS A CRITICAL INVESTMENT FOR YOUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH THE OTHER THING THAT'S NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED AND I REALLY HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT TERRIBLY MUCH ON THIS PODCAST IS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A FAIRLY CONSISTENT SLEEP ROUTINE NOW I REALISE THAT NOT EVERYBODY CAN GET TO SLEEP AT THE EXACT SAME TIME EACH NIGHT AND WAKE UP AT THE EXACT SAME TIME EACH MORNING AND FRANKLY THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL I CERTAINLY DON'T DO THAT HOWEVER WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE CIRCADIAN HEALTH LITERATURE IS THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD STRIVE AGAIN THAT STRIVE NOBODY'S PERFECT BUT STRIVE TO GET TO SLEEP AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME TIME EACH NIGHT AND WAKE UP AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME TIME EACH MORNING TURNS OUT TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR REGULATING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND INDEED FOR IMPROVING YOUR OVERALL LEVELS OF SLEEP GETTING THE OPTOL MOUNTS OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP AG A DEEP SLEEP AND RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IDEALY YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO SLEEP WITHIN PLUS OR MINUS ONE HOUR OF YOUR REGULAR SLEEP TIME SO IF OU'RE REGULAR TO BED TIME IS TEN O'CLOCK YOURE USED TO GETTING IN BED AT TEN O'CLOCK AND FALLING ASLEEP SOMEWHERE ROUND TEN THIRTY WELL THEN IF THE NEXT NIGHT YOU FALL ASLEP AT NINE THIRTY GREAT YOU'RE STILL WITHIN THA PLUSERMINUS ONE HOUR AND IF THE NEXT NIGHT YOU GO T TO SLEEP AND YOU DON'T FALL SLEEP TILL LEVEN THIRTY DON'T SWEAT IT IN FACT YOU'RE STILL WITHIN THAT PLUSERMINUS ONE HOUR HOWEVER IF YOU START GETTING INTO A HABIT OF GOING TO BED AT VASTLY DIFFERENT TIMES DEVIATING MORE THAN OR LESS THAN ONE HOUR FROM YOUR NORMAL TO BEDTIME WITHEN YOU'RE GOING TO START TO RUN INTO ISSUE SUCH AS WAKING UP FEELING GROGGY EVEN IF YOU GOT ENOUGH SLEEP SO EVEN IF YOU SLEPT THE FULL EIGHT HOURS THAT YOU'RE USED TO GETTING PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP MUCH LATER THAN THEY NORMALLY DO OR MUCH EARLIER THAN THEY NORMALLY DO START GETTING INTO AND OF ISSUES OF MOOD REGULATION ENERGY REGULATION NOT JUST IN THE MORNING BUT IN THE AFTERNOON LIKEWISE TRY TO WAKE UP AT MOREOR LESS THE SAME TIME EACH MORNING PLUSERMINUS ONE HOUR THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP YOU ANCHOR YOU'R OVER ALL SLEEP SCEDUAL AND IT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP LEAD TO PREDICTABILITY OF YOUR OVERALL LEVELS OF ENERGY MOOD AND FOCUSS THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE SECOND PILLAR IN THAT BIG SIX IS LIGHT AND I USED TO REFER TO THIS AS SUNLIGHT RIGHT I'D SAY AND I'M GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN NOW ALTHOUGH I'VE COVERED THIS IN A LOT MORE DETAILS AND JUST HITTING THE TOP CONTOUR CRITICAL ELEMENTS TRY TO VIEW SUNLIGHT THAT IS WITH YOUR EYES VIEW SUNLIGHT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER WAKING WHENEVER I SAY THAT THE MOST COMMON QUESTION I GET IS WHAT DO I DO IF I WAKE UP BEFORE THE SUN COMES OUT WELL UNLESS YOU HAVE SUPER POWERS THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF YOU CAN'T MAKE THE SUN COME OUT ANY EARLIER SO JUST FLIP ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS AS NEEDED UNTIL THE SUN COMES OUT AND THEN GET OUTSIDE FACE EAST IN THE MORNING TAKE OFF THOSE SUNGLASSES IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE TO LOOK AT LOW SOLAR ANGLE SUNLIGHT WITHOUT SUNGLASSES PROVIDNGYOURE NOT YOU'RE DRIVING INTO BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOU CRASH THIS KIND OF THING GET OUTSIDE LOOK AT THE SUNLIGHT DEFINITELY BLINK TO PROTECT YOUR EYES AS NEEDED BUT GET THAT SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES EARLY IN THE DAY THIS HAS MYRIAD POSIVE EFFECTS ON MOODFOCUS AN ALERTNESS AND NIGHT TIME SLEEP LATER THAT NIGHT AND IT DOES SO THROUGH A NUMBER OF WELL DEFINED BIOLOGICAL AND ENDERGRIN HORMONAL PATHWAYS THAT I'VE DISCUSSED ON MANY PREVIOUS PODCAST EPISODES AND YOU WANT TO DO THIS FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES ON NONOVERCASTAYS AND AS LONG AS TWENTY OR THIRTY MINUTES ON OVERCASTAYS AND THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE SECOND MOST COMMIN QUESTION I GET WHICH IS WHAT DO I DO IF THERE'S NO SUN WHERE I LIVE I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S NO SUNLIGHT LOOK IF YOU LIVE ON PLANET EARTH THERE'S ALWAYS SUNLIGHT THERE MIGHT NOT BE VERY MUCH OF IT THAT MIGHT BE VERY OVERCAST WHERE YOU LIVE IT MIGHT SEEM VERY DARK BUT TRUST ME THERE'S FAR MORE PHOTONS LIGHT ENERGY COMING THROUGH THAT CLOUD COVER EVEN IN THE DARKEST MORNINGS OF WINTER THEN THERE ARE AT NIGHT IN THOSE DARK WINTERS SO GET THAT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES AND DO IT AS CONSISTENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND ALSO DO THAT IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THAT'S CRITICAL FOR REGULATING YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK FOR REASONS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY BUT I'LL GET INTO IN A FUTURE POCKCAST REALLY EXPLAINING HOW THOSE CLOCK OSCILLATORS AND MECHANISM'S WORK BUT JUST TO KEP IT REALLY SIMPLE SINCEICEAS A TOOL KIT EPISODE FOR MOO D IN MENTAL HEALTH YOUR MOOD AND YOUR MENTAL HEALTH WILL BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY FROM GETTING MORNING SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES NOW IF YOU NEED TO GET MORE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES BECAUSE INDEED THERE'S JUST NOW ENOUGH SUNLIGHT OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUTSIDE AND THE VIEW SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNING FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU MIGHT INVEST IN GETTING A BRIGHT LIGHT SOURCE THAT YOU CAN PLUG IN YOU PROBABLY WANT ONE THAT'S AS BRIGHT AS TEN THOUSAND LUCKS SO THAT'S PRETTY BRIGHT THOSE FALL INDER THE CATEGORY SO CALLED SAD LAMPS ESSAY D SEASONABLE EFFECT OF DISORDER LAMPS AND YOU CAN'T PURCHASE THOSE THAT CAN BE SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE YOU CAN ALSO OP TO GET A NINE HUNDRED LUCKS DRAWING TABLET BY THE WAY I HAVE NO FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP TO ANY OF THESE SORTS OF LIGHT SOURCES YOU CAN FIND THEM PRETTY EASILY AND IN THE CASE OF THE NINE HUNDRED LUCKS LIGHT TABLET IM FAIRLY INEXPENSIVELY ON LINE AND YOU CAN PUT THAT ON YOUR DESK OR WHERE AN YOU HAVE YOUR MORNING COFFEE AND TRIND ENHANCE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LIGHT THAT YOURE GETTING IN THE MORNING BUT FRANKLY NOTHING IS AS GOOD AS SUNLIGHT SO IF YOU CAN'T GET SUNLIGHT YOU MIGHT TING ABOUT INVESTING IN ONE OF THOSE SAD LAMPS AND INDEED THOSE SAD LAMPS AREN'T ITS GOOD A SUNLIGHT BUT THEY ARE THE NEXT BEST THING IF YOU REALLY CAN'T GET SUNLIGHT ON A CONSISTENT BASIS A FEW OTHER FINE POINTS THAT I ALWAYS GET ASKED ABOUT FIRST OF ALL IT IS ABSOLUTELY OQE TO WEAR EYE GLASSES OR CONTACT LENSES THOSE SORTS OF CORRECTIVE LENSES ARE ACTUALLY IN A FOCUS THE LIGHT TO YOUR RETNA WHICH IS WHERE YOU WANT IT HOWEVER THIS WHOLE PROCESS A VIEWING MORNING SUNLIGHT IN AFTERNOONLIGHT DOES NOT AGAIN DOES NOT WORK THROUGH A WINDOW OR WINDSHIELD BECAUSE WINDOWS AND WIND SHIELDS FILTER OUT THE RELEVANT WAVELANES OFLIGHT THAT YOU WANT TO GET DIRECTLY ON TO YOUR RETNA AND SO THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT IN ADDITION PLEASE DON'T FEEL THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN AND CERTAINLY DON'T STARE AT THE SUN NEVER FORCE YOURSELF TO LOOK AT ANY LIGHT SUNLIGHT OR OTHERWISE THAT SO BRIGHT THAT IT'S PAINFUL TO LOOK AT SO IF IT'S COMFORTABLE FOR YOU TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN AND JUST BLINK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT ANY PAIN OR DISCOMFORT OR WATERING OF THE EYES PLEASE DO THAT YOU'RE GTTING A LOT OF FATONS INTO YOUR EYES AND THEIRE TRANSMITTING THAT TO YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR BRAIN TO THE REST OF YOUR BODY AND ON AND ON HOWEVER IF YOU FIND IT UNCOMFORTABLE TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN IN THAT CASE TO WHAT YOU'LL WANT TO DO IS OFFSET YOUR GAZE TO ON TEN OR TWENTY DEGREES WHICH IS NURGED SPEAK FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT TO THE RIGHT OR LOW BIT TO THE LEFT AND GET THE SUNLIGHT INTO YOUR EYES INDIRECTLY GAY AND I OFTEN ALSO GET ASK WHELL CAN I STAND IN THE SHADE WHILE I DO THIS WOULD IF I HAVE AN OVERHANG IN MY APARTMENT THE BEST THING IS OF COURSE GOING TO BE TO FACE DIRECTLY TO THE SUN AND LOOK EITHER DIRECTLY ATTED OR SLIGHTLY OFFSET BUT IF YOU CAN ONLY GET MORNING SUNLIGHT BYH GOING OUT ONDER YOUR BALCONY AND YOUR BALCONY DOESN'T FACE EAST RATHER IT FACES WEST YOU'LL STILL GET A LOT OF FAUTANS FROM THE SUN REACHING YOUR EYES THERE BUT IDEALLY YOU WOULD FIND SUNWAY TO LOOK TOWARD THE SUN FIRST THING IN THE MORNING I REALIZE THAT WITH KIDS AND WORK AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS THIS CAN BE CHALLENGING BUT IT IS A CHALLENGE WORTH MEATING MEANING DON'T LOSE YOUR JOB OR FORGET TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS TO DO THIS BUT YOU CAN BRING YOUR KIDS TO DO THIS AND INDEED YOU SHOULD IT SETS THEIR CIRCATIAN RHYTHMS ALSO AND PEOPLE OFTEN LASK WELL DOES IT WORK ON DOGS YOU KNOW AN INDEED DOGS AND OTHER ANIMALS HAVE THESE EXACT SAME CIRCUITS AND PATHWAYS FOR SETTING THEIR CIRCATING RHYTHM SO IT'S GREAT FOR THEM TO NOW THERE ARE ALSO CLEAR AND DOCUMENTED BENEFITS FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH TO GETTING BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES IDEALY FROM SUNLIGHT THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS MUCH AS YOU SAFELY CAN PLEASE DON'T GET SUNBURN DON'T GET CATARACTS BY GETTING TOO MUCH SUNLIGHT BUT GETTING OUT DOORS AND GETTING SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES DURING YOUR LUNCH BRAGE OR A WALK HERE AND THERE OR IF YOU HAVE TO REMAIN INDOORS DURING THE DAY GETTING THE LIGHTS IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AS BRIGHT AS POSSIBLE AS IS SAFELY POSSIBLE I SHOULD SAY IS KNOWN TO IMPROVE MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH WHY WELL BECAUSE THERE'S A SPECIAL SO CALLED OPSEN WITHIN THESE CELLS OF YOUR EYES CALLS MELINOPSEN THE DOESN'T RESPOND TO THE SAME DIFFERENCE IS IN COLOR THAT ARE PRESENT IN SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNING AND THE EVENING BUT RATHER RESPONDSE TO THE OVERALL BRIGHTNESS OF LIGHT SO VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS EITHER FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES ARE IDEALY FROM SUNLIGHT ACTIVATE THESE CELLS AND THESE CELLS PR OJECT THESE LWIRES WE CALL AXONS INTO SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT IMPROVE YOUR MOOD AND FEELINGS OF WELL BEING SO I CANT GIF YOU A SPECIFIC NUMBER YOU KDONT OF FIVE MINUTES A DAY OR TEN MINUTES A DAY JUST GET AS MUCH LIGHT IN YOUR EYES HA DAILY FROM SUNLIGHT THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS IS SAFE FOR YOU MEANING WHERE YOU'RE NOT GETTING SUNBURN AND YOU'RE NOT DAMAGING YOUR RETNA AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE DAMAGING YOUR RETNA WEALTH ANY TIME YOU HAVE TO BLINK OR TURN AWAY FROM LIGHT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BRIGHT THAT'S A SIGNAL THAT THE LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT SO WHILE YOU WANT TO PLACE YOURSELF INTO BRIGHT ENVIRONMENTS YOU DON'T WANT TO PLACE YOURSELF INTO ANY ENVIRONMENT SO BRIGHT THAT IT'S PAINFUL TO BE IN I'LLGUESS A USE THAT AS AMETRIC AND YOU SHOULD BE JUST FINED AND THE LAST POINT ABOUT LIGHT FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH IS A RELATIVELY RECENT THEME THAT'S EMERGING FROM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND THAT REALLY WAS DRIVEN HOME BY A RECENT STUDY THAT I MENTION WILL BE EARLIER IN THE EPISODE THIS IS THE STUDY PUBLISHIN NATURE MENTAL HEALTH SHOWING THAT DARKNESS DURING A PARTICULAR STAGE OF YOUR TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE YOU SO CALLED CIRCADIAN RHYTHM IS ALSO VERY BENEFICIAL FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND IT'S BENEFICIAL FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH IN A WAY THAT IS INDEPENDENT FROM LIGHT AND FROM SLEEP NOW WHAT O I MEAN BY THAT OAY WELL THEREARE NUMBER DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THIS CAN BE EXAMINED BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WHICH I LIKE OH SO MUCH IENTITLED DAY AND NIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND OBJECTIVE LIGHT STUDY IN MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHAT THE RESEARCHES DID IS THEY ANALYZED HOW MUCH LIGHT AND OR DARK PEOPLE WERE GETTING ACROSS THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE AND CORRELATED THAT WITH MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES LOOKING AT A RANGE OF DIFFERENT MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES INCLUDING BY POLAR DISORDER SCHIZOFRENI A DEPRESSION PITIESTI AND MUCH MORE AND I'LL GO INTO THIS STUDY IN A LOT OF DETAIL IN THE FUTURE EPISODE CAUSE IT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STUDY WITH SO MANY GEMS WITHIN IT THAT WE SHOULD ALL KNOW ABOUT BUT ONE OF THE KEY THINGS FROM THE STUDY IS THAT THE POSIVE EFFECTS OF DAYTIME SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE AND THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF NIGHT TIME DARK EXPOSURE THAT MEANS OF COURSE THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT ARE INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER PUT DIFFERENTLY MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE IN VERY DIM TO COMPLETELY DARK INVIRONMENTS FOR A CONTINUOUS SIX TO EIGHT HOURS WITHIN EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS CIRCADEAN CYCLE IS CORRELATED WITH MUCH BETTER MENTAL HEALTH OUT COMES IN OTHER WORDS WE SHOULDN'T JUST THINK ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF LIGHT IN THE MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS POSIVE FOR MENTAL HEALTH THAT'S ALL TRUE IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND THIS STUDY FURTHER VERIFIES THAT BUT THAT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME TIME INDEED DECADES FROM THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND OF COURSE IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS INTUITIVELY AND SUBJECTIVELY WITHOUT DETAILED SCIENTIFIC MEASUREMENT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO STAY IN VERY DIM TO DARK ENVIRONMENTS FOR EIGHT HOURS EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR I SHOULD SA APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HOURS IN EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE THEY BENEFIT FROM IMPROVED MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH OUT COMES IN A WAY THAT'S INDEPENDENT OF HOW MUCH LIGHT THEY'RE GETTING AND INDEPENDENT OF HOW MUCH SLEEP THEY ARE GETTING THE POINT IS THIS THE TIME WHEN YOU WAKE UP CONSIDER THAT TIME ZERO AND THEN ABOUT AGAIN YOU'RE NOT TO BE SUPERSTRICT ABOUT THIS ABOUT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THAT WAKE UP TIME YOU SHOULD BE IN A VERY DIM TO DARK ENVIRONMENT FOR THAT SIXTEEN HOUR TO TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD AFTER WAKING UP OQUE WHAT DO I MEAN BY THIS I MEAN IF YOU GO TO SLEEP AT TEN P M AND YOU WAKE UP AT SIX A M WHILE THAT TEN P M TO SIX A M PHAS OF YOUR CIRCADEAN CYCLE YOU SHOULD BE IN VERY DIM LIGHT OR ENTIRELY DARK ENVIRONMENT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REFERENCE ANOTHER STUDY WHICH AS PUBLISHED IN THE PROCEEDS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES WHICH SHOWS THAT EVEN HAVING A SMALL AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THE ROOM WHICH ISN'T EVEN THAT BRIGHT WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH EYES CLOSED CAN DISDROP MORNING GLUCOSE LEVELS SO IN OTHER WORDS KEEP YOUR SLEEP ING ENVIRONMENT DARK KEEP YOUR NIGHT TIME ENVIRONMENT DIM TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITIES RIGHT CERTAINLY GO OUT TO DINNER EVERY ONE M IILL GO TO THE MOVIES GO OUT AND HAVE A PARTY ENJOY YOURSELF IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL GOD FORBID OR YOU HAVE TO TEND TO SOME EMERGENCY DO THAT BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN CONTROL IT WITHIN THE CONFINES OF LIFE AND ITS DEMANDS KEEP YOUR NIGHT TIME ENVIRONMENT DIM OR DARK BECAUSE THAT INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY SUNLIGHT ANOTHER BRIGHT LIGHT THAT YOUR VIEWING DURING THE DAYTIME AND AFTERNOON IS GOING TO POSIVELY IMPROVE YOUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH NOW MOVING ON TO THE OTHER PILLARS AND THESE I'M GOING TO MOVE THROUGH A BIT MORE QUICKLY THAN I HAVE THE PREVIOUS TO BECAUSE WE'VE DONE ENTIRE SERIES ON THES OR I SHOULD SAY SERISES SERIESES THAT HE PRONOUNCED IT SO ONE PUT THE PLURE OF SERIESIES IN THE IN THE COFMENTS ON YOU TO THE THIRD PILLAR IS MOVEMENT AND WHEN I SAY MOVEMENT I MEAN EXERCISE AS YOU ALL KNOW WE SHOULD ALL STRIVE TO GET ANYWHERE FROM HUNDR AND EIGHTY TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MINUTES OF ZON TWO CARDIO PER WEEK THAT'S MOVEMENT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HOLD HE CONVERSATION BUT WERE YOU TO DO IT MORE INTENSELY OR EVEN A BIT MORE INTENSELY YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLETO HOLD THAT CONVERSATION ANDITION WE SHOULD DO SOME VIOTWO MAX WORK WE SHOULD GET OUR HEART RATE VERY HIGH AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK DOING SOME SORT OF MOVEMENT THAT SAY FOR YOU SO THAT COUL BE RUNNING OR CYCLING OR SWIMMING OR POLLADIES WHATEVER IT IS FOR YOU GETTING YOUR HEART RIGHT WAYWAY UP IS ALSO IMPORTANT AND TO DO THAT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK BUT DAILY MOVEMENT EITHER CAUGTOVASCULAR TRAINING OR RESISTANCE TRAINING AND IT'S VERY VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED BOTH MAY BE NOT ON THE SAME DAYS IN FACT I SPLIT THEM TO SEPARATE DAYS RESISTANCE TRAINING DONE FOR ANYWHERE FROM SIX TO TEN SETS PER MUSCLE GROUP EITHER CLOSE TO OR TWO FAILURE F THIS COULD BE WITH WEIGHTS IT COULD BE WITH BANDS IT COULD BE WITH MACHINES ALL OF THAT WAS COVERED IN DETAIL IN THE PODCAST SERIES THAT I DID WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALPAN AND EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGIST WHOSE EXPERT IN ALL THOSE AIREES I ALSO DID AN EPISODE ON FOUNDATIONAL FITNESS PROTOCAL THAT HAS BEEN DISTILLED INTO A VERY SIMPLE THREE PAGE P D F THAT YOU CAN GET FOR COMPLETELY ZERO COST BY GOING TO HUBERN LABDOC CALM AND JUST PUT FOUNDATIONAL FITNESS PROTO CALL P D F NDOU'LL BE TAKEN TO THAT TOOL KIP SW ALL OF THE DETAILS OF A WEEKLY EXERCISE ROUTINE THAT INVOLVES DAILY MOVEMENT BUT ALSO CERTAINLY MY CASE INCLUDES AT LEAST ONE FULL DAY OF REST PER WEEK BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE DO INDEED NEED ONE MAY BE VEN TOOFULL DAYS OF REST PER WEEK SO THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE THIRD PILLAR MOVEMENT BUT WE KNOW THAT CARDIVASCULAR TRAINING IN RESISTANCE TRAINING ARNCHES GREAT FOR OUR BODY THEY ALSO IMPROVE MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH THAT'S SO VERY CLEAR FROM THE RESEARCH LITERATURE SO WE CAN'T OVERLOOK THOSE IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH NOW THE FOURTH PILLAR IS NUTRITION AND NUTRITION IS A BIG TOPIC IT'S A VERY BARBEDWIRE TOPIC IF YOU GET YINVOLVED IN THE STUFF ON LINEIN OF YOUVE YOU'VE GOT YOUR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW CARNIVORE IS BETTER THAN VG ANY OF THE PEOPLE BELIEVE VIGAN IS BETER THAN CARNIVORE MOST PEOPLE ARE OMNIVORES YOTE YOUR SEED OIL DEBATES AND ON AND ON AND ON WE'RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH ANY OF THAT NOW INDEED IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT NUTRITION AND WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK FOR SAKE OF ESTHETIC CHANGES WEIGHT LOST MUSCLE GAIN ET CETERA I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE GUESSED EPISODE THAT WE DID WITH DOCTOR LANE NORTON CAN FIND THAT AGAIN AT HUBERMAN LABDOK COM WHENE WE DO A DEEP DIVE ON ALL THE VARIATIONS IN DIFFERENT NUTRITIONAL PROTOCALS BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOUR VIGUE AND OMNIVORE CARNIVORE OR KEETO OR WHATEVER EVERYBODY NEEDS TO CONSUME SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS BUT NOT EXCESS AMOUNTS OF QUALITY CALORIES PER DAY NOW YOU MAY DO THAT BY INTRUMENT AND FASTING YOU MAY DO THAT BY MORE TRADITIONAL MEAL SCEDULING BUT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO NEED TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOUR BODY AND BRAIN AND INDEED THE PARTS OF YOUR BODY AN BRAIN THAT TRANSLATE TO MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH REQUIRE MACRINUTRIANTS PROTINES FATS AND CARPIDRATES AS WELL AS MICRO NUTRIENT SO THE KEY TAKE AWAY WITH NUTRITION IS TO MAKE IT QUALITY NUTRITION WITHIN THE BOUANDS OF WHATEVER SOR OF NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMM THAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING AND THAT MEANS GETTING MOST OF OUR FOOD SOURCES FROM EITHER NON PROCESSED OR MINIMILY PROCESS FOODS SO THESE WOULD BE FOODS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO PREPARE OR FOODS THAT WOULD PERISH OM OVER TIME THESE ARE NOT THE SORTS OF FOODS THAT LIVE IN BOXES AND CANS AND OTHER A PACKAGES THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO LIVE ON THE SHELVES FOR EVER AND EVER OCAN AS I SAY THAT I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SHOUTING BUT WHAT ABOUT RICE YOU KNOW RICE CAN LIVE ON THE HELL FOR A LONG TIME AND YES O GET I CONSIDER RICE A MINIMILY PROCESSED FOOD BECAUSE OF COURSE IT CAN LIVE ON THE SHELL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND HERE I'VE JUST GOING TO BACK OUT OF THE WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT NUTRITION AT THIS POINT BECAUSE AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL IT'S A DEEP SERIES OF RABIT HOLES THAT WE CAN FALL INTO AND REALLY GET DISTRACTED THE POINT IS MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH FOOD DON'T OVER EAT WE KNOW ENERGY TOXICITY IS A PROBLEM FOR NOTJOUS BODY COMPOSITION BUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SO YOU WANT TO GET ENOUGH CALLRIES BUT NOT TOO FEW CALORIES AND YOU' WANT TO MAKE SURE THATYOU'RE GETTING THEM FROM QUALITY SOURCES AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE OF COURSE FOOD IS NOT JUST THE SUBSTRAIGHT FOR THE THE CELLER REPAIR AND INDEED PRODUCTION OF TISSUES IN YOUR BODY BUT IT'S ALSO THE SUBSTRATE FOR ALL THE SOURTS OF NOR TRANSMITTERS RIGHT WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM AMENOASID PRECURSERS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM FOOD RIGHT ALL OF THAT DOPAMINE STUFF AND CERATONAN STUFF IS DERIVED FROM A MENOASSES THAT COME FROM FOOD SOURCES SO THE LENGTH BETWEEN NUTRITION AND MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD NOW BE AN OBVIOUS ONE AS WE ALL KNOW QUALITY NUTRITION INFLUENCES OF COURSE ARE PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALT ND OUR COGNIV FUNCTIONING OUR MEMORY OURE ABILITY TO LEARN NEW THINGS AND TO FOCUS AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF HIGH QUALITY NUTRITION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ENOUGH VIDEMENS AND MINERALS FROM HIGH QUALITY UNPROCESSED OR MINIMLY PROCESS SOURCES AS WELL AS ENOUGH PROBIOTICS AND PREBOTICS AND FIBRE TO SUPPORT BASIALLY ALL THE CELLAR FUNCTIONS IN OUR BODY INCLUDING THE GUP MICROBIOM NOW I LIKE MOST EVERYBODY TRY TO GET OPTIMAL NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS IDEALY MOSTLY FROM MINIMILY PROCESSED OR NON PROCESS FOODS HOWEVER ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE FACE S GETTING ENOUGH SERVINGS OF HIGH QUALITY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY AS WELL AS FIBER AND PROBIOTICS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY THOSE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S WHY WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE LONG BEFORE I EVER HAD A PODCAST I STARTED DRINKING A G ONE AND SO I'M DELIGHTED THE A G ONE IS SPONSERING THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL DRINK A G ONE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES ALL OF MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT PROVIDES INSURANCE THAT I GET THE PROPER AMOUNTS OF THOSE VIDEAMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBER TO INSURE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE YOU CAN GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOKCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THE'RE GIVING AWAY FI FR TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VIDEMEN D THREE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THAT SPECIAL OFFER THE FIFTH PILLAR IN THE BIG SIX IS SOCIAL CONNECTION AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LBIT MORE ABOUT THIS LATER IN THE EPISODE BUT LET' JUST BE VERY BRIEF AND SPECIFIC ABOUT THIS WE ALL NEED TO STRIVE TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THAT WE FEEL TACS OR EVEN VEX US THAT CAUSE US STRESS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS COVERED IN DEPTH IN THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR LESA FELDMEN BEAR IT WHERE SHE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE DON'T JUST HAVE A NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT REGULATES ITSELF THROUGH EXPERIENCE AND THROUGH OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR ACTIONS WE ARE AS A SPECIES INTERACTING WITH OTHER NERVOUS SYSTEMS BOTH OF OUR OWN SPECIES OTHER HUMANS AS WELL AS NONHUMAN SPECIES DOGS AND CATS AND IF YOU HAVE EM HORSES AND OTHER ANIMALS SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AS BEING BOTH REGULATED FROM THE INSIDE AND THROUGH OUR OWN ACTIONS AND CHOICES AND THOUGHTS BUT ALSO THROUGH INTERACTION WITH OTHER NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND WHILE WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE AS MUCH CONTROL OVER WHICH SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OR WORK INTERACTIONS WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN WE SHOULD REALLY STRIVE TO UNDERSTAND AND INDEED PAY SOME SERIOUS ATTENTION TO WHETHER OR NOT CERTAIN TYPES OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OR WHAT SHE REFERED TO AS NET SAVINGS NEUTRAL OR TAXING I CERTAIN TYPES OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE OR GROUPS OF PEOPLE JUST MAKE US FEEL TACT TAT MAKES US FEEL STRESSED IT LEADS TO NEGATIVE AFFECT THAT IS NOT GOOD FEELINGS OR EMOTIONS AND OFTEN ELEVATED LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL THAT LEAVE US RUMINATING AND LEAVE US HAVING CHALLENGES WAS SLEEP WE REALLY SHOULD ALL STRIVE TO LIMIT THOSE INTERACTIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN ON THE REVERSE SIDE OF THAT AS LESA FELDMAN BEAR IT SO BEAUTIFULLY POINTED OUT WE ALSO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO REGULATE EACH OTHERS NERVOUS SYSTEMS IN WAYS THAT PRODUCE SAVINGS THAT IS THAT ALLOW US TO FEEL AND INDEED CAUSE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT MAKE US FEEL NOT JUST HAPPIER NOT JUST RELAXED NOT JUST HAPPY BECAUSE WE ENJOY INTERACTING WITH SOMEBODY BUT OR A GROUP BUT THAT GIVE US A SAVINGS THAT GIVE US THE KIND OF RESOURCES LITERALLY METABOLIC AND NOR CHEMICAL RESOURCES THAT MAKE US FEEL MORE CAPABLE AND GIVE US A SENSE OF ELEVATED MOOD AND IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH WHEN WE ARE NOT ENGAGING WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND THIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE OF COURSE BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH IN FACT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME EVN JUST FIVE OR TEN MINUTES THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO ARE THE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS THAT I INTERACT WITH THAT LEAVE ME FEELING TAXED YOU KNOW THAT REALLY SEEM TO DRAIN MY ENERGY AND HAVE ME RUMINATING AND IN A NOT GOOD SPACE WHEN I LEAVE WHATEVER INTERACTION I HAD WITH THEM THIS COULD BE A REAL INTERACTION OR AN ONLINE INTERACTION INDEED I DID THIS THE OTHER DAY BASED ON LESAS SUGGESTION I FOUND IT TO BE TREMENDOUSLY USEFUL BUT I DID AS I DECIDED TO AND BY THE WAY THIS WAS HAPPENING ON A RUN WHERE I WAS THINKING YOU KNOW ALLOT OF MY MIND IS IN A CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE THAT AREN'T EVEN HERE I WAS TO WORKING THROUGH A CONVERSATION I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WOULD SAY WHAT I DID SAY WHAT THEY SAID IN AN INTERACTION THAT UNFORTUNATELY WAS PRETTY UNPLEASANT IT WASN'T EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT BUT IT WAS PRETTY UNPLEASANT AND I REALIZE OKE THAT IS A SORT OF INTERACTION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO AVOID IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT WASN'T HAPPENING RIGHT THEN BUT IT WAS CARRIED FORWARD INTO A PORTION OF MY DAY MY MORNING RUN THAT FOR ME IS NORMALLY VERY PLEASUREFUL AND QUITE SACRED TO ME ACTUALLY SO PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO HOW MUCH YOUR INTERNAL DIALOGUE IS WITH YOURSELF VERSES WITH OTHERS AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IS EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL NDON 'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ALWAYS JUST THINKING ABOUT ONESELF AND NOT THING ABOUT OTHERS TO THE CONTRARY WE ALSO NEED TO THINK AS LEAST A POINTED OUT ABOUT WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE INTERACT WITH OR OBSERVE THAT LEAD US TO HAVE ON GOING DIALOGUE WITH THEM IN OUR MIND OR THINK ABOUT THOSE INTERACTIONS IN WAYS THEY GIVE US ENERGY THAT LEAD TO ENERGETIC SAVINGS LITERALLY METABOLIC SAVINGS THAT WE CAN APPLY NOT JUST IN THOSE INTERACTIONS BUT IN OUR WORK ENDEAVORS AND OUR SO LOW ENDEAVOURS WHATEVER THAT WE'RE DOING WHEN WE ARE AWAY FROM THOSE PEOPLE SO WHILE THIS CONCEPT OF SAVINGS OR NEUTRAL OR TAXATION OF OUR METABOLIC AND OUR NEUROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS MIGHT SEEM A LITTLBIT SQUISHY IT IS NOT SQUISHY THIS IS A NEURA BIOLOGICAL CONCEPT IS ALSO A PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPT AND IT'S ONE THAT I'M SO GLAD THAT LEASTS ARE BROUGHT UP BECAUSE SOCIAL CONNECTION SOCIAL INTERACTION IS SO VITAL TO OUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH BUT OFTENTIMES WE HEAR SOCIAL CONNECTION WE THINK OH THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH FRIENDS WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE DINNER PARTIES WELL SURE THAT'S ALL FINDING GOOD IF YOU CAN DO THAT AND I DO OF COURSE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SPEND TIME WITH THOSE THAT THEY LOVE BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO TAKE A STEP BACT AND JUST THINK A BIT MAYBEVEN RIGHT OUT A BIT NOW WHOARE THE GROUPS AND SORTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND INTERACTIONS THAT REALLY TAX YOU WHOARE THE PEOPLE YE FIND KIND OF NEUTRAL AND WHAT ARE THE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS THAT REALLY PROVIDE WHAT LEAST A REFER TO AS SAVINGS THAT IS THEY TAP INTO THE METABOLIC AND NEUROCHEMICAL PATHWAYS THAT LEAD US TO HAVE IMPROVED MOOD IN MENTAL HEALTH NOT JUST DURING THOSE INTERACTIONS BUT AWAY FROM THOSE INTERACTIONS AS WELL AND OFTEN PERVASIVELY AND EXTREMELY POSITIVELY SO SO THIS IS NO SMALL DEAL THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH NOW THE SIXTH PILLAR IN THE BIG SIX IS STRESS CONTROL AND THE REASON IT'S INCLUDED IS THAT LOOK STRESS IS GOING TO HAPPEN LIFE IS FILLED WITH SO CALLED STRESS ORDERS AND FOR GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS INBACT THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAS BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NERW SCIENCE AS WELL WHETHER NOT STRESS IS GOOD FOR US WHETHER NOT STRESS IS BAD FOR US WHETHER NOT WE SIMPLY NEED TO REFRAME STRESS AS GOOD OR BAD AND TO SOME EXTEND ALL OF THAT IS TRUE YOU KNW WE KNOW THAT CHRONIC STRESS IS NOT GOOD FOR OUR MEMORY OUR MUN SYSTEM ORE OUR HEALTH WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE REALITY WHICH IS THAT STRESS ALSO ALLOWS US TO HARNESS OUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL RESOURCES TO PERFORM BETTER THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT PROVIDED WE CAN GET TO SLEEP EACH NIGHT THAT PERHAPS STRESS IS 'N SO BAD AND PERHAPS AS EVEN PERFORMANCE ENHANCING I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE GUEST EPISODE WITH DOCTOR ALLY CRUM FROM THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT STAMFORD AND HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND OTHER PODCASTS AS WELL AND I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THAT STRSS IS GOOD FOR YOU I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THE STRESS IS BAD FOR YOU WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU IS THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL HAVE READILY ACCESSIBLE STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT WORK THE FIRST TIME AND EVERY TIME AND THESE FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES THE FIRST CATEGORY ARE REAL TIME TOOLS SO TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO REDUCE YOUR LEVEL OF STRESS IN REAL TIME AND THE BEST WAY THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT'S GROUNDED IN EXCELLENT PHYSIOLOGY AND NER SCIENCE TO REDUCE YOUR STRESS IN REAL TIME IS THE SO CALLED PHYSIOLOGICAL SILE I DID NOT INVENT THIS PATTERN OF BREATHING ITS NOT BREATH WORK PERSEY THIS IS A PATTERN OF BREATHING THAT WE ALL NATURALLY DO IN OUR SLEEP TO RESTORE CARMODOXIDE AND OXYGEN LEVELS TO THEIR PROPER RATIOS WE ALSO DO IT PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITHOUT NOTICING INDEED WE HAVE A DEFINED OR SPECIFIC NERAL CIRCUIT IN OUR BRAIN THAT EXTENDS TO OUR DIAPHRAMAND COMMUNICATES WITH ASPECTS OF OUR HEART ET CETERA THAT A LOW PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE TO CAM US DOWN FASTER AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAN ANY OTHER DIRECTED PROTOCOL AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE AS MANY IF YOU KNOW IS VERY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD ANYONE CAN DO THIS YOU SIMPLY DO A BIG INHAIL THROUGH YOUR NOSE TRYIN MAXIMIZE THE INFLATION OF YOUR LUNGS AND THEN BEFORE YOU EXHAIL SNEAK IN ANOTHER BRIEF INTILATION EVEN IF IT'S JUST A TINY MICHRO INNILATION TO MAXIMILY INFLATE THE LUNGS AND THAT HAS AN IMPORTANT EFFECT ON THE LITTLE SACKSON THE LUNGS CALL T IT IV YOLEAVE THE LUNGS IT'S GOING TO OPEN UP WHATEVER AVIOLI WERE COLLAPSED IN THERE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DO A LONG EXTENDED EXHAIL THROUGH THE MOUTH AND TYPICALLY JUST ONE ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES IT REQUIRES TWO OR THREE BUT JUST ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGE IS EFFECTIVE IN BRINGING DOWN ONE'S LEVEL OF STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO DO IT AGAIN SO THIS CAN BE DONE ESSENTIALLY ANYWHERE AND BY ANY ONE I SUPPOSE PROBABLY CULDN'T DO IT IF YOU ARE UNDER WATER OR CERTAINLY DON'T DO IT IF YOU'RE UNDER WATER BUT OTHERWISE IT'S A VERY SAFE AND VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO CALM DOWN AND REDUCE YOUR LEVELS OF STRESS IN REAL TIME MAY BE BEFORE PUBLIC SPEAKING OR IN WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCE YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN IN REAL TIME SO I'LL DEMONSTRATE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE FOR YOU HERE I'VE DONE THIS MANY TIMES BEFORE AND PREVIOUS EPISODES BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVEN'T HEARD OR SEEN THOSE EPISODES I FEEL A OBLIGATED O DO IT AGAIN NOW O CA SO IT'S A DEEP INHAILTHROUGH THE NOSE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER BRIEF INHAL THROUGH THE NOSE AND THEN A LONG EXHELL THROUGH THE MOUTH AND BEFORE YOU START ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT DO I DO IF I HAVE A DEVIATE SEPTEM CAN IT BE JUST THROUGH THE MOUTH DO THE FIRST TWO THROUGH THE NOSES DO THE THIRD THROUGH THE MOUTH SO IT'S LIKE THIS AND INDEED I FEEL CALMER AND INDEED IF YOU DO IT YOU WILL FEEL CALMER YOU'LL NOTICE THAT SECOND INHAIL THROUGH THE NOSE WAS CAN IT SHARP IN THE SENSE THAT I HAD TO REALLY PUSH IM PUT SOME PHYSICAL EFFORT INTO MAKING IT HAPPEN AND YOU KNOWI MY SHOULDERS JOLTED UPWARDS IF YOU ARE JUST LISTENING TO THIS AND NOT WATCHING MY SHOULDERS SHOULTED UPWARDS THAT SECOND INHAIL THROUGH THE NOSE IS IMPORTANT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS I'VE TALKED ABOUT ELSEWHERE SO THE PHYSIAL OGICAL SIZE IS GOING TO BE THE GO TO PROTOCAL FOR YOU AGAIN NOT INVENTED BY ME THIS IS NOT HUBERMAN BREATHING THIS IS A PATTERN O BREATHING DISCOVERED IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES BY PHYSIOLOGISTS IT'S HARD WIRED INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO GREAT IT WORKS THE FIRST TIME AND IT WORKS EVERY TIME SO THAT'S TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE BEST WAY TO CONTROL YOUR STRESS IN REAL TIME NOW WHISE THAT IMPORTANT FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH WELL AS WE'LL TALK ABOUT LATER IF YOU WANT TO ACCESS YOUR SO CALL GENERATIVE DRIVE A THEME THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO IN A BIT MORE DETAIL THIS IS SOMETHING CAME UP DURING THE SERIES WITH DOCTOR PAULCONTI YOU WILL LEARN THAT STRESS AND ANGER AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS WHILE THEY CAN BE VERY MOTIVATING VERY AROUSING THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR YOUR LONG TERM MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH PERIOD SO HAVING TOOLS TO REGULATE YOUR STRESS AND YOUR LEVELS OF ANGER YOUR LEVELS OF REACTIVITY AND ALSO TO ELEVATE YOUR FEELINGS OF AGENCY AND CONTROL OVER YOUR LIFE STARTING WITH AGENCY AND CONTROL OVER YOUR PHYSIOLOGY YOUR INTERNAL STATE IS GOING TO BE VITAL AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE IS THAT OF COURSE IT'S COMPLETELY ZERO COST BUT ALSO THERE'S A DEDICATED CIRCUIT IN YOUR BRAIN END BODY FOR THIS PARTICULAR PATTERN OF BREATHING WE DO IT SPONTANEOUSLY BUT YOU CAN DO IT INTENTIONALLY AND IT WORKS TJUST AS WELL IF NOT BETTER TO REGULATE YOUR LEVELS OF STRESS THAT IS TO BRING THEM DOWN WHICH HAS OUTSIZE PAUS IFVE EFFECTS ON YOUR MOODIMENTAL HEALTH NOT JUST IN THE MOMENT BUT IT ALSO SHOULD IMPROVE YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT WHEN STRESS COMES BECAUSE THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH STRESSERS IT'S NOT IF IT'S WHEN WHEN STRESS COMES THAT YOU WILL HAVE A PHYSIOLOGICALLY SCIENTIFICALLY SUPPORTED TOOL TO DEAL WITH AND REDUCE THAT STRESS NOW IN ADDITION I DO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR SAKE OF MOODIMENTAL HEALTH TO ALSO HAVE A TOOL OR A PROTOCAL TO RAISE YOUR STRESS THRESHOLD THAT IS TO INCREASE YOUR CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH LIFE STRESSERS WITHOUT THEM FEELING SO STRESSFUL AND THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS BUT THEY ALL CENTER AROUND ELEVATING YOUR LEVEL S OF A DRENOLIN EPINEFERON AND NOR APINEFERON NORA DRENOLINE THOSE ARE THE SAME THING JUST THEY MULTIPLE NAMES FORGIVE ME I DIDN'T GIVE THE SAME TWO THINGS FOR NAMES SO DON'T BLAME ME BLAME THE OTHER SCIENTISTS THAT DID IT THE POINT IS THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THAT YOU CAN SELF INDUCE ELEVATIONS OF NORA DRENOLINE AND A DRENOLINE AND THEN TO LEARN TO ANCHOR YOUR MIND AN YOU'RE THINKING TO STATE CALM IN THOSE ELEVATE IT A DRENLIE STATES AS A PRACTICE FOR WHEN STRESSERS HIT YOU IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND YOUR A DRENOLINE IN NORA DRENNOLINE SPIKE NOW ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT WORKS THE FIRST TIME AND EVERY TIME AND IS ALSO ZERO COST IN FACT IT WILL SAVE YOU MONEY IS TO PUT YOURSELF IN A COLD SHOWER OR OTHER DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ENVIRONMENT BUT MOST EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO A COLD CHOWER NOT EVERYONE BUT MOST PEOPLE AND OF COURSE BY TURNING OFF THE HEAT YOU'RE GOING TO REDUCE HEATING COSTS RITE YOUR WATERBILL SO GETTING INTO A COLD SHOWER FOR A MINUTE OR SO TO ELEVATE YOUR LEVELS OF DRENOLIN AND LEARNING TO EITHER USE YOUR BREATHING YOU COULD DO PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE OR TO DISTRACT YOURSELF OR WHATEVER TOOLS AND APPROACHES YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO STAY CALM WELL YOU HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF A DRENOLINE IN YOUR BODY AND THE REASON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WORK SO WELL TO DO THIS IS THAT IT IS PRETTY NON NEGOTIABLE EVEN IF YOU REALLY LOVE COLD SHOWERS OR COLD PLUNGES OR THINGS OF THAT SORT YOU'RE STILL GOING TO GET THAT ELEVATED A DRENOLINE AND NORA DRENOLINE IT'S PRETTY MUCH NON NEGOTIABLE NOW FOR THE FIRST TEN OR FIFTEEN SECONDS THAT YOU GET INTO A COLD PLUNGE OR COLD SHOWER YOU SHOULD FULLY EXPECT YOURSELF TO FEEL STRESSED AND FOR YOUR BREATHING TO ACCELERATE AND THEN YOUR GOAL IS TO TRY AN ANCHOR OR CONTROL YOUR BREATHING IN THAT STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT  THE REASON FOR DOING THIS IS THAT IT'S A PRACTICE IT'S A PRACTICE THAT'S GOING TO TRANSLATE TO A BETTER ABILITY TO MANAGE YOUR INTERNAL STATE AND THERE FOR YOUR THINKING YOUR COGNITION AND YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS UNDER STRESS IT'S NOT ABOUT COMING UNTOUCHED BY STRESS IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO BETTER NAVIGATE STRESS INDEED I THINK OF THIS AS ANALOGOUS TO DRIVING IN FOG SOMETHING THAT I HAD TO LEARN TO DO BECAUSE I GROW UP IN THE BAAREA AND IT CAN BE VERY FOGGY THERE SOMETIMES AND OF COURSE YOU DON'T LEARN TO DRIVE IN FOG THE FIRST DAY YOU LEARN HOW TO DRIVE BUT THE FIRST TIME YOU HIT HEAVY FOG DRIVING WHERE YOU CAN ONLY SEE ONE REFLECTOR IN FRONT OF YOU AT A TIME IT IS TRULY STRESSFUL RIGHT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOIN TO COME UP ON ANOTHER VEHICLE IN AN INSTANT WHICH OF COURSE CAN HAPPEN SO YOU HVETO JUST A NUMBER OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO THAT AND WHILE I WOULD NEVER ELECT TO DRIVE IN FOG LEARNING TO DRIVE IN FOG TEACHES YOU HOW TO BE COMFORTABLE DRIVING IN DIFFERENT WEATHER ENVIRONMENT SAMETHING WITH DRIVING IN A RAINSTORM ER FOR YOU EAST COASTERS FROM THE NORTH EAST LEARNING HOW TO DRIVE IN A SNOWSTORM YOU WOULD NEVER ELECT TO DO THAT BUT ONCE YOU DO IT A FEW TIMES YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THOSE EXTREME CONDITIONS SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT RAISING YOUR STRESS THRESHOLD IS ALL ABOUT OF COURSE DO IT SAFELY DO IT UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH YOU'RE NOT GOINGTO GET HURT OR ANYONE ELSE WILL GET HURT BUT LEARNING HOW TO DO THIS CAN BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL AN OF COURSE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURESNT THE ONLY WAY BUT FRANKLY IT'S THE MOST RELIABLE WAY AND IT'S THE MOST VERSATILE WAY TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT IN YOUR SHOWER OR IN A COL PLUNGE AT HOMES YOU CAN PRACTISE THESE THINGS AGAIN SAFETY FIRST ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT EXPOSING YOURSELF TO COLD TO THE EXTENT THAT YO'RE OING TA DAMAGE YOURSELF MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY BUT IT'S A GREAT PRACTICE AND YOU COULD ROBABLY THINK OF OTHER WAYS TO SPIKE YOUR DRENALINE THAT WAS SAFE AN OF COURSE LIFE WI'LL SPIKE YOUR ADRENALINE SO YOU CAN ALSO YUSE REAL LIFE AS YOU'RE AH YOU KNOW YOU'RE STRESS INOCULATION TOOL AND WE ALL HAVE TO DO THAT ANYWAY WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT YOU ADOPT A REAL TIME TOOL PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE AND THAT YOU ADOPT AT LEAST ONE OFF LYING TOOL THAT YOU DO ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE MAY BE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK BUT AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK THAT YOU PUT YOURSELF INTO A COLD SHOWER DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE NOT FORSAKE OF INCREASING MATABOLISM OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT REALLY JUST TO LEARN HOW TO CALM YOURSELF AND MAINTAIN CLEAR COGNITION WHEN STRESS HITS BECAUSE INDEED STRESS AS GOING TO SO THAT'S THE BIG SIX FOR IMPROVING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THE BIG SIX APPLY THAT IS THEY ARE THE CORNER STONE FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU ARE REGARDLESS OF YOUR AGE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOUR DEALING WITH AN ACUTE OR SEVERE MOODER MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER OR YOU FIND YOURSELF TO BE REASONABLY HEALTHY WITH RESPECTO MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND YOU SIMPLY WANT YOUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH TO BE STABLE AND OR IMPROVE OVER TIME NOW THE REASON WHY THE BIG SIX THOSE SIX PILLARS ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND INDEED FORM A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WHAT DOCTOR PAULCONTI REFERRED TO AS THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF SELF CARE IS THAT THOSE SIX PILLARS ESTABLISH A MILEU THAT IS AN ENVIRONMENT OF NER CHEMICALS INCLUDING YOUR OMODULATORS SUCH AS DOPAMY AN CERATONAN EPINEPERON NOR EPINEFERANACEETO COALING AND OTHER NORCHEMICALS AS WELL AS WEALLIS HORMONES TESTOSTRON ESTEROGEN PROLACED AN CORDISSALL AND I MUNEMOLECULES AND ON AND ON THAT LEAD TO A HIGH DEGREE OF PREDICTABILITY IN YOUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM NOW WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WHY WOULD PREDICTABILITY BE SUCH A KEY COMPONENT OF MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH IS IT REALLY JUST ABOUT KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL ENERGIZED IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY ENTIRED AT THE END OF THE DAY NOW THAT MIGHT BE PART OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT THE MAJOR TAKE AWAY THE MAJOR TAKE AWAY IS THAT AS DOCTOR LISAFELMAN BEARIT SO APTLY POINTED OUT YOUR BRAIN AND INDEED YOUR ENTIRE NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS A COUPLE OF MAJOR JOBS HAS THE JOB OF REGULATING YOUR BREATHING AND YOUR HEART RATE ET CETERA IT ALSO HAS THE JOB OF REGULATING YOUR THINKING AND YOUR PLANNING AND YOUR MEMORY THOSE ARE THE JOBS OF THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WE NORMALLY HEREABOUT BUT IF WE THINK ABOUT THE MORE MACKRO JOBS THAT THE BRAIN HAS THE KEY FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN CERTAINLY THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE MORE RECENTLY EVOLVED THE ONES INVOLVED IN THINKING AND PLANNING ET CETERA ARE REALLY INVOLVED IN GENERATING PREDICTIONS PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN N EXT AND WHETHER NOT YOU ARE GOING TO BE PREPARED FOR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT  INDEED DOCTOR ELISA FELDMEN BEAR IT ALSO BEAUTIFULLY ILUSTRATED THIS MODEL OF THE BRAIN AS REGULATING A BRAIN BODY BUDGE IT AND MOODS AND A RELATED TOPIC WHICH HE CALLED AFFECT I I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT AFFECT IS IN A MOMENT SETTING THE STAGE FOR BEING ABLE TO BETTER PREDICT WHAT'S CAN IT HAPPEN NEXT AND THEREFORE REGULATING YOUR MOOD IN THE MOMENT LET'S JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND EXPLORE THAT STATEMENT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ESSENTIALLY WHAT SHE WAS SAYING IN WHAT I'M NOW AGAIN SAYING IS THAT YOUR BRAIN ENBODY GO THROUGH DIFFERENT STATES YOUR STATE AT A GIVEN MOMENT CAN BE LABELLED AS YOUR AFFECT YOUR AFFECT INCLUDES A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC ARALSAL LEVELS OF HORMONES LEVELS OF TRANSMAERS ALL OF THAT STUFF BUT IT FALLS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF AFFECT AFFECT ESSENTIALLY SETS THE STAGE FOR PARTICULAR EMOTIONS TO BE MORE LIKELY OR LESS LIKELY TO EMERGE SO EMOTION AN AFFECT AREN'T THE SAME THING AFFECT IS A BIT MORE GENERAL IN SORT OF UNDERGURDS THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING CERTAIN MOODS LIKE FEELING ELATED HAPPY OR SAD OR DEPRESSED WE REALLY SETS THE GENERAL STAGE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPECIFIC EMOTIONS EVEN HIGHLY SPECIFIC EMOTIONS SO IN THAT WAY WHEN YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF THE BIG SEX WHEN YOURE TENDING TO THESE SIX PILLARS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE REALLY WANT ATTEND TO THOSE SIX PILLARS EVERY SINGLE DAY OR EVERY SINGLE TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE THOSE AR REGULAR INVESTMENT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WHEN WE DO THAT WE CREATE A NEUROCHEMICAL AND A NURL MILEU THAT ALLOWS THE BRAIN TO BE IN A BETTER PREDICTIVE STATE IT ALLOWS THE BRAIN TO GIVE RISE TO CERTAIN AFFECTS SPELLED A FFF E C T S SO AFFECTS THAT LEAD TO CERTAIN EMOTIONS BEING MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR PUT VERY SIMPLY WHEN WE'RE TENDING TO THOSE SIX PILLARS ON A REGULAR BASIS WE FEEL BETTER MORE GENERALLY AND THEREFORE THE EMOTIONS THAT WE TEND TO HAVE UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS EVEN CONDITIONS OF A DIFFICULT INTERACTION WITH A CO WORKER WITH A FAMILY MEMBER TEND TO BE MORE POSITIVE THAN IF WE ARE NOT TENDING TO THOSE SIX PILLARS NOW IN SOME SENSE THAT SORT OF A DUST STATEMENT FOR INSTENCE IF YOURE SLEEP DEPRIVED IF YOU'RE NOT FED WELL LIKE YOU HAVENT EATEN IN A FEW HOURS OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE MORE IRRITABLE YOU'RE GOING TO BE MORE REACTIVE YOUR ARE GOING TO BE MORE EMOTIONALLY LABILE BUT SLEEP AN NUTRITION ARE JUST TWO OF THOSE SIX CORPE PILLARS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE CORPS PILLARS AND THE NECESSITY FOR TENDING TO THEM ON A REGULAR EVERY TWENTY FOR OUR BASIS WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS CREATING A MILIU WITHIN OUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO DO WHAT IT DOES BEST AND IN FACT WHAT IT'S MAIN JOB IS TO DO WHICH IS TO PREDICT WHAT'S CAN A HAPPEN NEXT BECAUS HAS LEAST A FELDMAN BEAR IT POINTED OUT EMOTIONS ARE REALLY CONTEXT DEPENDENT STATES THAT ALLOW US TO NAVIGATE NOT JUST OUR PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY ARE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BRING BEST GUEST ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ARE SOON GOING TO ENCOUNTER NOW I DON'T OFFER YOU ALL OF THAT AS KIND OF A IA BUNCH OF YOU KNOW TANGLE MESS OF NERVE SPEAK TO CONFUSE YOU WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT BY TENDING TO THOSE SIX COR PILLARS YOU ARE SHIFTING THE LIKELY AFFECTS THAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE AND THEREFORE THE LIKELY EMOTIONS THAT YOU'ILL EXPERIENCE SO YOU'RE BISING YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM TOWARDS MORE POSITIVE AFFECT AND MORE POSITIVE EMOTIONS REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES HAPPEN TO BE AND THE STRESSERS THAT YOU ENCOUNTER AND INDEED YOU ALSO INCLUDING THAT SIX PILLAR OF STRESS CONTROL SO WHEN THEE STRESSERS ARRIVE YOU WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO NAVIGATE THEM NOW THIS VIEW OF EMOTION REGULATION OF MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH IS CERTAINLY NOT A NOVEL CONCEPT PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL REGULATION OF MOOD FROM THE TIME OF WILLIAM JAMES AND EVEN EARLIER NOW IT'S BEEN A LONGSTANDING QUESTION FOR INSTANCE OR DEBATE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY YOU KNOW DO WE FEEL ANXIETY IN OUR BODY AND THEN LABEL IT AS ANXOITY OR DO WE FEEL ANXIETY IN OUR MIND AND THEN OUR BODY FOLLOWS THAT'S BEEN A LONGSTANDING DEBATE AND FRANKLY THERE'S EVIDENCE ON BOTH SIDES WHICH LEADS ME TO THE CONCLUSION I THINK MOST NERBIOLOGISTS AND PSYCHOLOGIST OF THE CONCLUSION THAT THOSE THINGS ARE INTERRELATED IN A WAY THAT WE CAN'T REALLY DISSOCIATE THEM COMPLETELY AT ANY LEVEL RIGHT WHEN YOUR HEARTRIGHTE GOES UP AN YOUS ARE BREAD THING FASTER AN IF I WERE TO INDUCE THAT STATE IN YOU YOU'D PROBABLY INTERPRET THAT IS FEELING ANXIOUS IN ADDITION TO THAT SOMETHING CAN MAKE YOU ANXIOUS BEFORE YOUR HEARTWRIGHT IN BREATHING IND CREASES THE THN YOUR HEARTRIGHT IN BREATHING INCREASES SO NO NEED TO TEASE THOSE APART BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN IN LARGE PART AS A PREDICTION MACHINE AND YOUR BRAIN AS A METABOLIC REGULATORS TRYING TO DECIDE WHICH ORGANS NEED RESOURCES HOW MUCH RESOURCE CAN I DEDICATE TO THINKING TO CREATIVITY TO ENJOYING SOCIAL INTERACTION TO PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS SAYING AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE MY BODY ALL OF THOSE MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN AS THEY RELATE TO AFFECT AND EMOTIONS ARE GOING TO BE BEST SUPPORTED THAT IS BIASED TOWARD POSITIVE MOOD POSITIVE AFFECT POSITIVE EMOTIONS AND THEREFORE POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES WHEN WE'RE TENDING TO THOSE SIX PILLARS DOCTOR LISSA FELVAN BARRETT REFERRED TO THAT WHOLE PROCESS AS THE BRAIN REGULATING A BRAIN BODY BUDGET AND SHED BEAUTIFUL ANALOGIES FOR THAT BUDGET AND THAT'S WHAT LED TO THE DESCRIPTION OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IS EITHER GENERATING SAVINGS OR BEING NEUTRAL OR GENERATING A TAXED FEELING LITERALLY TAXING THAT BRAIN BODY BUDGET AND I LOVE THAT CONCEPT IN THATSONE THAT YOU CAN KEEP IN MIND AND INDEED WE CAN INJECT A LOT OF SPECIFICITY INTO THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF IMPROVING MOOD IN MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH SPECIFIC PROTOCALS IF YOU SIMPLY REMEMBER IF YOU MAKE A DAILY INVESTMENT IN THE SIX CORPS PILLARS YOU ARE BUILDING UP THAT BRAIN BODY BUDGET YOU WILL HAVE MORE ENERGETIC RESOURCES TO SPEND ON WHATEVER LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES COME YOUR WAY NOW BEFORE WE MOVE INTO A DISCUSSI ON ABOUT PROTOCOLS FOR HOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR LIFE NARRATIVE TO ENHANCE YOUR SENSE OF SELF AND CONFIDENCE AND THINGS OF THAT THEME I BRIEFLY WANT A MENTION THAT OF COURSE THERE ARE NON TOOLS OUT THERE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL COMMUNITY FOR IMPROVING MOODI MENTAL HEALTH AND WHILE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF TOOLS ONE OF THE MAIN TOOLS OF THE PSYCHIATRIS IS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT TARGET SPECIFIC NORMODULATOR SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY FOR INSTANCE S S ARS SELECTIVE CERATONAN REUPTAKE IN HIBITORS OR A TYPICAL ANTIDEPRESSENCE THAT TARGET THE DOPOMINE AND EPINEFERAN SYSTEMS SUCH AS WELL BEUTRAN PROPRIORON OR OTHER TYPES OF ANTIDEPRESSENCE OR FOR INSTANCE NOWADAYS THERE'S A LOT OF GROWING EXCITEMENT ABOUT CLINICAL TRIALS USING RELATIVELY HIGHDOSAGES OF SYLICIBON WHICH BY THE WAY CLOSELY MIMICS THE CHEMICAL SERATONAN THAT'S RIGT SYLICIBON WHICH IS CONVERTED TO SOLISON IN THE BRAIN IF YOU LOOK AT IT CHEMICALLY IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE SERATONANTHOUGH HAS DISTINCT EFFECTS FROM CRATONAN I TALKED ABOUT SYLICIBON AND WHAT'S BEING DONE IN TERMS OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS I TALKED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL HAZARD CONSIDERATIONS AND WHERE THE LEGALITY AND ALL THAT IS GOING IN THAT EPISODE IF YOU WANT A CHECK THAT OUT BUT THE REASON I'M TAKING A MOMENT TO MENTION THESE DRUGS THINGS LIKE ESESORIS PROS AXOLOPSITALOPRAM WELL BEUTRON SYLCIBON AND SO ON IS THAT ALL OF THEM TARGET SPECIFIC NARMODULATOR SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND AT THE SAME TIME IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR THAT MOOD DISORDER SUCH AS MAJOR DEPRESSION ARE NOT NECESSARILY DEFISITS IN THINGS LIKE SERATONAN OR DOPOMINE THEY CAN BE BUT MOST OFTEN THEY ARE NOT SO WHY ARE SUCH DRUGS PRESCRIBED FOR MOOD DISORDERS AND FOR MENTAL HEALT DISORDERS WELL BECAUSE IF SPECIFIC NARMODULATORS LIKE SERATONAN DOPOMINE OR EPINEPERON AR DRAMATICALLY INCREASE ABOVE BASE LINE THAT AFFORDS THE BRAIN THE ABILITY TO REWIRE ITSELF REALLY THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT ESCESSORISE OR A TYPICAL INTO DEPRECENCE OR SYLICIBAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF MAJ OR DEPRESSION IS REALLY TO THINK ABOUT THEM AS CHEMICAL TOOLS TO OPEN OR ACCESS O NEURAL PLASTICITY AND THAT'S WHY IT'S O SO IMPORTANT THAT THOSE DRUGS BE COMBINED WITH TACTHERAPY WHERE PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING THROUGH THE SOURCES THE REAL LIFE SOURCES AND THE HISTORICAL SOURCES MAY BE EVEN THE TROMABASE SOURCES OF THEIR DEPRESSION AND I MENTION THE BECAUSE THE OTHERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE NOWADAYS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW THESE DRUGS ARE USEFUL WHETHER NOT THE SIDIFET PROFILES JUSTIFY THEIR USE WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW THEY ARE APPLICABLE TO YOUNG POPULATIONS THE OTHER'S A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT THIS AND CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF THE PSYCHODELICS THERE'S A LOT A LOT OF DEBATE BECAUSE THIS IS NEWLY EMERGING ARIAN THEI'RE STILL NOT A LOT OF DATE ALTHOUGH IT'S STARTING TO YOU KNOW INCREASE OVER TIME BUT THE KEY POINT HERE IS THAT ALL OF THESE DRUGS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO WORK IN SOME PEOPLE NOT OTHER SOME PEOPLE  ONLY SIMPLY DON'T WORK FOR IN THE CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS THAN SOLUTIONS THEY SOLVE BUT THEY TEND TO WORK BY INCREASING THE PROPENSITY FOR NEURAL PLASTICITY BY CHANGING THE NEUROMODULATOR MILEU IN THE BRAIN AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT WHEN THINKING ABOUT TOOLS FOR ENHANCING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT TOOLS FOR ENHANCING MOODIMENTAL HEALTH AND NEXT OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGN TO TARGET A SPECIFIC ASPECT OF ONE'S LIFE STORY OR CONCEPT OF SELTH ALL OF THAT IS ALWAYS OPERATING ON A BACKDROP OF TWO THINGS THAT OVER ALL NEUROCHEMICAL MILIU AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTION THAT THE SIX PILLARS RELATE TO AND SUPPORT IF WE'RE TENDING TO THOSE BUT ANY IMPROVEMENT IN MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH THATS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT IT'S GOING TO BE NOTICEABLE AND IT'S GOING TO BE STABLE IT'S GOING BE PERVASIVE OVER TIME IS GOING TO REQUIRE THAT SOME DEGREE OF NERL PLASTICITY SOME DEGREE OF NERL REWIRING OCCUR SO 'M NOT BRINGING UP THE TOPIC OF THESE PARTICULAR DRUG TOOLS TO SAY THAT THEY ARE THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE MOOD IND MENTAL HEALTH I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THAT THEY ARE BUT ONE WAY TO POTENTIALLY IMPROVE MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO WORK THEY ALWAYS WORK BEST WHEN DONE IN CONCERT WITH TALC THERAPE BECAUSE THEY ARE OPENING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR NERL PLASTICITY BUT THEN THAT NERL PLASTICITY HAS TO BE DIRECTED TOWARD A PARTICULAR AND POINT THERE HAS TO BE SPECIFIC WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY THE INDIVIDUAL OR IDEALLY THE INDIVIDUAL WITH AN EXPERT TRAIN CLINICALLYE CERTIFIED THERAPIST OR PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NERL PLASTIC CHANGES THAT OCCUR LEAD TO LONG STANDING IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH OVER TIME INDEED THE DRUGS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGN AS TOOLS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACCESS CHANGES WITHIN THEIR BRAIN THAT WOULD THEN ALLOW THEM TO ENHANCE MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH BUT NOT HAVE TO RELY ON THE DRUGS THEMSELVES FOR IMPROVED MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND ALONG THOSE LINES SURE SOME OF YOU OUT THERE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENT BASED OR NEUTRICIAN BASES APPROACHES TO ENHANCING THESE NERMODULATORS AND INDEED WHILE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME POTENCY AS THINGS LIKE WHELE BUTRNAN ESSESARISE THAT INCREASING THINGS LIKE DOPAMNE AND SARATONEAN RESPECTIVELY THERE IS A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE RELYING ON THEY DAILY SUPPLEMENTATION WITH ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE GRAMS WITH AF ELTIRACINE YOU KNOW AMENOACID PRECURSAR TO DOPAMINE COMBINED WITH OFTEN YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED OR SIX UNDER MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAGY P C AS A WAY TO ENHANCE DOPAMINE AND ASETO COLINE AND TO SET THE STAGE FOR ELEVATED LEVELS OF NERL PLASTICITY BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE AMENOASCID PRECURSERS TO THE VARIOUS NERMODULATORS LIKE ELTIRE SENE LIKE ELTRIP TO FAN SO ALTIRACINE PRECURSUR O DOPAMINE AL TRIPP TO FAN PRECURSURE TO CERATONAN AND SO ON THAT THOSE DON'T HAVE THE SAME DEGREE F POTENCY THAT IS ABILITY TO ENHANCE THOSE NEUROMODULATORS AND SO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ENRICH THE POSSIBILITY FOR NEROPLASTICITY STILL REMAIN SOMEWHAT OBSCURE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN CLINICAL TRIALS ON THAT YET AT LEAST NOT CLINICAL TRIALS THAT I AM AWARE OF SO I MENTION ALL OF THAT STUFF ABOUT DRUGS WHETHER NOT AT PSYCHODELICS OR WHETHER NOS PRESCRIPTION ANTIDEPRESCENTS OR WHETHEROR NOT PEOPLE ARE USING A SUPPLEMENT BASE A MENOACID BASED PROTOCAL FOR INCREASING CERTAIN NEROMODULATORS FEEL IS IMPORTEDT TO MENTION ALL OF THAT BECAUSE WHILE FIRST OF ALL IT'S QUITE PROMINENT OUT THERE CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF PROSCRIPTION ANTIDOPRESSINS AND THERE'S GROWING PROMINENCE AN USE OF RELATIVELY HYDOSYLICIBAN AGAIN ALWAYS IN DONE WITH SUPPORT TALCTHERAPE THIS IS DONE IN THE LEGAL SETTING I SAID LEGAL NOT ILLEGAL A LEGAL SETTING WITH A BORD CERTIFITHERAPASIES AS BEING DONE ON UNIVERSY CAMPUSES WITHIN RESEARCH LAPS AND OF COURSE I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEIARE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THESE COMPOUNDS OUTSIDE THE REALM OF THE UNIVERSITY CLINICAL STUDY ENVIRONMENT SO I MENTION THESE CHEMICALS NOT BECAUSE I'M POINTED TO THEM AS THE PATH TO IMPROVED MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH THEY CAN BE BUT THEY AREN'T ALWAYS AND AS I MENTION BEFORE THEY CAN SOMETIMES CAUSE PROBLEMS THAT LEAD PEOPLE TO WISH THAT THEY HADN'T TAKEN THEM OR TO DECIDE TO NOT TAKE THEM ANY FURTHER A DECISION THAT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE MADE WITH A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL WHOSE WELT CERTIFIED TO DO THAT BUT I MENTIONING THESE TOOLS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY WORK WHY THEY WORK AND ONE KEE POINT THAT WAS REALLY EMPHASIZED BY DOCTOR PAULCONTI WHO AS MENTION BEFORE AS A PSYCHITRI SO HE USES PHORMICOLOGY AND IS PRACTICE ALTHOUGH HE USES OTHER NONPHORMICOLOGIC TOOLS AS WELL IS THAT THESE FORMICAL OGICT TOOLS ARE NEVER TO BE VIEWED AS THE BE ALL END ALL OF ENHANCING MOODIMENTAL HEALTH THEY ARE BUT ONE PATH TO IMPROVING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND INDEED SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A PATH TO GETTING PEOPLE WHO ARE OTHERWISE UNABLE TO ENGAGE IN THOSE SIX COR PILLARS THOSE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF MENTAL HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE THINGS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEN PERHAPS BASED ON A DISCUSSION WITH THERE CLINITION THESE PEOPLE COULD COME OFF THOSE PHARMICALOGIC AGENTS MAYBE YES MAYBE KNOW IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THOSE CORE SIX PILLARS THOSE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT IN CLUEBUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE CORE SIX PILLARS ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THERE'S NO DRUG THAT CAN REPLACE THOSE CORESIX PILLARS I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND THANK OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKER IS A PERSONALIZED NUTRITIAN PLATFORM THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDIANE TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTHICALS I'VE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TAST I MAJOR PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TEST OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT METABOLIC FACTORS LIPIDS AND HORMONES AND SO FORTH BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WITH INSIDE TRACKER THEY MAKE IT VERY EASY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZE PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THE LEVELS OF ALL THOSE THINGS METABOLIC FACTORS LIPIDS HORMONS ET CETERA BUT IT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT RELATE TO NUTRITIAN BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION SUPPLEMENTS ET CETERA THAT CAN HELP YOU BRING THOSE NUMBERS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMAL FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY INSIDE TRACTOR YOU CAN GO TO INSIDE TRACKER DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACTORS PLANS AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKER DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN O K SO SETTING ASIDE THE COR SIX PILLARS LET'S NOW TALK ABOUT OTHER TOOLS FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH THAT CENTERE AROUND REALLY WHAT WE MORE TIPICALLY THINK OF WHEN WE THINK OF MOUDIMENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS EMOTIONS WHEN DOCTOR LISA FELDMAN BEAR IT WAS A GUEST ON THE PODCAST SHE SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY INCREDIBLE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S STRONGLY GROUNDED IN EXCELLENT SCIENTIFIC DATA WHICH IS THE MORE SPECIFICITY THAT WE CAN PUT TO LABELLING OUR EMOTIONS THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF OUR OVER ALL MENTAL HEALTH WE RESTATE THAT THE MORE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN PUT TO OUR OWN INTERNAL EMOTIONS EVEN IF THAT LANGUAGES JUST TO OUR SELVES IN OUR OWN INTERNAL NARRATIVE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SPEAK OUT THAT WHAT THOSE LABELS ARE THE BETTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO FEEL OVER TIME AND D INDEED THIS EFFECT CAN BE QUITE RAPID AND INDEED DOCTOR LESA FELDMENBERIT HAS DONE RESEARCH ON THIS VERY SPECIFIC TOPIC ITS SOMETHING THAT'S REFERRED TO AS EMOTIONAL GRANDULARITY SO WHILE SOME OF US MOVE THROUGH LIFE WITH A SORT OF WHAT I CALL EMOJIFICATION OF EMOTIONS YOU MAY GETYO HAPPY FACE HAPPY YOURE SAD FACE SAD IF YOU'RE ANGRY DEPRESSED ANXIOUS YEF THOSE ARE LABELS FOR EMOTIONAL STATES OR YOU COULD THINK OF THEM AS AFFECTS OR EMOTIONS I THINK OF THEM AS EMOTIONS BUT THEY'RE NOT VERY SPECIFIC THEIRE PRETTY BROAD BEINGS WE SAY SAD OR DEPRESSED OR SUPERDEPRESSED OR SUPERSAD ANXIOUS PANIC YEN WE THINK OF THAT AS NUAUNTS BUT IT'S NOT VERY NEW ANTS AND LISAS LABORATORY AND OTHER LABORATORIES HAVE EXPLORED TWO THINGS FIRST IF PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO ARE ENCOURAGED TO PUT MORE GRANULARITY MORE SPECIFICITY ON WHAT THEIR FEELING THEN IT SEEMS THAT THEIRE LEVELS OF EMOTIONAL PROCESSING ARE BETTER OVER ALL HOW DOES THAT TRANSLATE TO EMOTIONS WHELL IT TRANSLATES TO BETTER OVER ALL FEELINGS OF WELL BEING WHEN ONE IS PLACING MORE SPECIFICITY ON POSITIVE EMOTIONS AND THE FLIPSIDE IS ALSO TRUE THIS IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF ONE PLACES MORE SPECIFICITY ON NEGATIVE EMOTIONS IT ALSO CAN ENHANCE ONE'S AND OF EXPERIENCE OF THOSE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS NOW THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS A TWO SIDED BLADE RITHIS ISN'T ALWAYS A GOOD THING AND IF ONE IS THINKING ABOUT PROTOCALS FOR IMPROVING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH THE DATA MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT ADDING MORE SPECIFICITY TO OUR POSITIVE EMOTIONS AND TERMS THAT THE LANGUAGE WE USE BUT ALSO JUST THE DEPTH WITH WHICH WE PROCESS AND THINK ABOUT THOSE PAUSIVE EXPERIENCES CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR US SO THERE ARE TWO STUDIES THAT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT RELATE TO THIS THE FIRST IS ENTITLED EFFECT OF SELF MONETORING THROUGH EXPERIENCE SAMPLING ON EMOTION DIFFERENTIATION IN DEPRESSION AND THE SECOND STUDY IS ENTITLED EMOTIONAL GRANULARITY INCREASES WITH INTENSIVE AMBULATORY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGICAL AND INDIVIDUAL FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW MUCH NOW EACH OF THESE STUDIES FOCUS ON SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THE FIRST STUDY WAS MAINLY FOCUST ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEPRESSION AND THEY WERE CUED SEVERAL IF NOT MANY TIMES PER DAY TO JUST THINK ABOUT AND REPORT ON THEIR EMOTIONAL STATE AND THAT WAS DONE IN ORDER TO GET PEOPLE TO PLACE MORE GRANULARITY MORE SPECIFICITY ON WHAT THEIR FEELING BUT ALSO SIMPLY TO TAP INTO HOW THEIR FEELING ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE SECOND STUDY WHICH IS ONE THAT INCLUDED DOCTOR LESA FILLMAN BER AS AN AUTHOR WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE IF FOCUSED ON NON DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS AND AT CUDE THEM TO TOUCH INTO THEIR EMOTIONS MORE TIMES PER DAY AND IT ALSO INCLUDED SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS AND ONE IN PARTICULAR THATWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN SOME DETAIL NOW I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF THESE STUDIES I MAY DO THAT IN A FUTURE PODCAST EPISODE BUT THE KEY TAKE AWAYS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO KNOW WHICH ARE FIRST OF ALL THE MORE OFTEN THAT YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF YOU KNW WHAT AM I REALLY FEELING RIGHT NOW HOW DO I FEEL AND AND THIS IS SO CRITICAL THE MORE THAT YOU FORCE YOURSELF TO NOT USE BROAD LABELS OR SIMPLY VALANC LABELS VALANCE LABELS ARE GOOD OR O K OR BAD AND INSTEAD UNDERSTAND THAT GOOD IS NOT AN EMOTION O K IS NOT N EMOTION BAD IS NOT AN EMOTION BUT RATHER SAYING YOU KNOW I FEEL  CURIOUS BUT A LITLE ANXIOUS IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE CASE OR I FEEL YOU KNOW BORED A BUT YOU KNOW ALSO A LITTLE BIT IN POSITIVE ANTICIPATION ABOUT WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN TO MORROW THINGS OF THAT SORT PUTTING MORE NUANS AND SPECIFIC TY ON YOUR EMOTIONS BUT ALSO TOUCHING INTO ARE THINKING ABOUT YOUR OWN EMOTIONAL STATES MORE TIMES PER DAY CLEARLY HAS POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND THIS IS SOMETHING EVERYBODY SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD IT BE THAT PUTTING MORE SPECIFICITY ON WHAT WE'RE FEELING SO PERHAPS JUST IN OUR OWN HEADS LIKE THINKING OOK IT HOW TO I FEEL RIGHT NOW LIKE IF I WERE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW I'D SAY I FEEL ENERGIZED AND HAPPY I DO I REALLY ENJOY DOING WHAT I'M DOING SO I WOULDN'T SAY I'M LIKE OFF THE CHARTS IN AWE OR ELATION BUT I'M VERY HAPPY AND I FEEL ENERGIZED YOU EARLIER TO DAY I WAS FEELING A LITTLE BIT FATIGUED AND ELITEATE CONFUSED BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO SOART OUT SOMETHING IN A IWASN'T MAKING SENSE TO ME AH SO ASSESSIMENTS LIKE THAT WHICH CAN BE TOLD TO SOMEBODY ELSE SOR THAT WE JUST HOLD INTERNALLY DONE REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO SIX TIMESTHROUGHOUT THE DAY JUST PERIODICALLY PINGING OURSELVES MAYBE SET AN ALARM OR MAY BE JUST DECIDE TO EVERYONE IN A WHILE YOU KNOW MAYBE EVERY TIME YOU YOUGO INTO AN ELEVATOR OR EVERY TIME YOU GO PE OF FLIGHT OF STAIRS YOU JUST ASK YOURSELF YET HUNTO  I FEEL RIGHT NOW AND THINKING ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT AND YOU DON'T TO WRITE IT DOWN ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE YOU COULD WUT TURNS AUT THE JUST THAT PRACTICE CAN REALLY ENHANCE OUR SO CALLED EMOTIONAL GRANULARITY THAT CAN ENHANCE ARE POSITIVE EMOTIONS IN AFFECT AND IN ADDITION IT PROVIDES US A BETTER SENSITIVITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THOSE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS WHICH SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A BAD THING BUT THOSE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS HAVE INFORMATION IN THEM RIGHT THIS IS ONE THING THAT'S OFTEN LOST IN THOSE BROAD CATEGORIZATIONS OF ANXIOUS OR SAD OR DEPRESSED AND KEEP I MIND OF COURSE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GENUINELY CLINICALLY DEPRESSED AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY JUST LIKE SOME PEOPLE ARE GENUINELY CLINICALLY ANXIOUS AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKENS SERIOUSLY BUT MOST OF US WHEN WE THROW OUT THE WORDS DEPRESSED ANGRY SAD WE'RE NOT USING ENOUGH NUAUNTS AND IT DOESN'T REALLY APPLY TO OUR INTERNAL STATES WHERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WEREIN AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE SUFFER IT'S NOT CIOUS ABOUT COMMUNICATING OUR EMOTIONS WE SUFFER BECAUSE THE DATA SAY THAT THE MORE NUANTS THE MORE EMOTIONAL GRANULARITY THAT WE HAVE THE RICHER IS OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF LIFE AND THE MORE EFFECTIVELY WE CAN NAVIGATE THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF LIFE RIGHT AGAIN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS PERHAPS IS IN THE BEST WAY TO EVEN DESCRIBE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS BECAUSE THAT LABEL NEGATIVE IMPLIES THAT WE SHOULD AVOID IT AND IN FACT THOSE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS PROVIDE A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT PERHAPS SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THAT WE SHOULD SEEK TO AVOID IN THE FUTURE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH NOW ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF INCREASING EMOTIONAL GRANULARITY AND TOUCHING IN SEVERAL TIMES PER DAY AND TO HOW WE FEEL SOMETHING THAT'S COMPLETE LY ZERAL COST TAKES JUST A MOMENT TO DO THAT WE CAN GET MUCH BETTER AT OVER TIME THAT WAS CLEARLY SEEN IN THESE STUDIES THAT PEOPLE GET MUCH BETTER AT DOING THIS IT BECOMES MORE FACILE FOR THEM VERY QUICKLY IS THAT IT CORRELATES WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS THAT RELATE TO OVERAUL IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THE SPECIFIC PHYSIOLOGICAL METRIC THAT I'M REFERRING TO IS SO CALLED VAGAL TONE SOME OF YIOU OF PERHAPS HEARD OF THE VAGUEST NERVE IT'S THE TENTH CRANIAL NERVE ITS AN EXTENSIVE PARIFERAL NERVE THAT IT GOES OUT OF THE BRAIN AT THE LEVEL OF THE THE NECK IT'S ONE OF THE CRANIAL NERVES THAT EXTENDS ON TO ESSENTIALLY ALL THE ORGANS OF THE BODY THE HEART BELONGS ET CETERA BUT IT'S A TOA STREET IT'S A SUPER HIGHWAY OF NERVES OUT OF THE BRAIN AND INTO THE BODY AND IT'S A SUPER HIGHWAY OF NERVES BACK FROM THE BODILY ORGANS TO THE BRAIN AND IT'S INVOLVED IN REGULATING A LOT OF SO CALL AUTONOMIC FUNCTION SO HOWFAST OUR HEART RAT IS HOWFAST OUR BREATHING IS RATES OF DIGESTION AND ALL OF THAT WEAVES TOGETHER TO CREATE THOSE THINGS THAT WE CALL AFFECT OUR INTERNAL STATES SO WITHOUT GOING INTO A TON OF DETAIL ABOUT THE VAGUEST NERVE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED CARDIAC VAGAL CONTROL CARDIAC VAGAL CONTROL IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT VAGUEST NERVE CAN IMPACT YOUR HEART RATE AN YOUR OVERALL FEELINGS OF CALM OR ALERTNESS NOW THE SIMPLE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS MORE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS HEART RATE VARIABILITY HARTRAY VARIABILITY IS SIMPLY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOUR HEART BEATS OR RATHER THE TIME BETWEEN YOUR HEART BEATS WHICH WE KNOW IF THOSE TIMINGS BETWEEN YOUR HEART BEATS ARE SOMEWHAT VARIABLE THAT IS CORRELATED WITH POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES ONE OF THE WAYS THAT OU CAN INCREASE HEART RAY VARIABILITY IS TO GET REGULAR CARTY OFASCULAR EXERCISE AS WELL AS DOING RESISTANCE EXERCISE AND NO SURPRISE GETTING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF QUALITY SLEEP EACH NIGHT IS ALSO GOING TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR HEART RATE VERYABILITY NOW EXERCISE AND SLEEP OF COURSE A WONDERFUL BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S ALSO A VERY RAPID WAY TO INCREASE HEART RATE VARABILITY BY ACTIVATING THE VAGAL INNERVATION OF THE HEART AND THE WAY THAT THE HEART AND SOME OTHER CIRCUITS WITHIN THE SO CALE BRAINSTEM INTERACT AND THAT'S THROUGH SOMETHING CALLED RESPIRATORY SINESS A RHYTHMIA RESPIATORY SINUS ARHYTHMIA CAN BE SUMMARISED VERY SIMPLY BY SAYING WHEN YOU INHALE YOU SPEED YOUR HEART RATE UP AND WHEN YOU EXHALE YOU SLOW YOUR HEART RATE DOWN AND IT'S THAT EXHALE SLOWING YOUR EART RATE DOWN THAT'S MEDIATED BY THE VAGUEST NERVE NOW THERE'S A MORE THOROUGH DESCRIPTION OF THAT WHICH ILL JUST GIVE YOU NOW AND IT'S NOT THAT LENGTHY SO HERE'S HOW IT GOES WHEN YOU INHALE YOUR DIAPHRAM ACTUALLY MOVES DOWN AND AS A CONSEQUENCE YOUR HEART ACTUALLY GETS A LITTLE BIGGER AS LOMORE SPACE AS A CONSEQUENCE THE FLUID IN YOUR HEART MOVES A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY PER UNIT VOLUME AND THERE'S A NERL SIGNAL TO SPEED THE HEART UP CONVERSELY WHEN YOU EXHALE THE DIAPHRAM MOVES UP THAT MEANS IS A LITTLE LESS SPACE FOR THE HEART IN THE GENERAL ARIA WHERE IT SITTING THE HARTGETSAL BUT SMALLER LITLE MORE COMPACT THAT MEANS THAT THE FLUID IN YOUR HEART IS MOVING MORE QUICKLY THROUGH THAT SMALLER SPACE AND THERE'S A NURL SIGNAL MEDIATE BY THE VAGUS TO SLOW THE HEART DOWN SO THAT'S WHY INHAIL SPEED YOUR HART UP AND EXCELS SLOW YOUR HEART DOWN THAT IS THE BASIS OF SO CALLED OR ESSAY OR RESPIRATORY SCINES A RHYTHMEA NOW WHAT IS IT ANY OF THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE GRANULARITY OF LANGUAGE THAT WE PLACE ON OUR EMOTIONS TURNS OUT THEIR SEVERAL STUDIES SHOWING THAT WHEN PEOPLE PLACE MORE DESCRIPTIVE GRANULARITY ON THEIR EMOTIONS THAT IS CORRELATED WITH OKEY IT'S NOT CAUSAL BUT IT'S CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN RESPIRATORY SCINESCE A RHYTHMEAT WHICH WE KNOW CORRELATE WITH IMPROVEMENTS AND HEART RATE VERY ABILITY INDEED IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR BASIES FOR HEART RATE VERY BILITY WHICH WE KNOW IS CORELATED WITH NOT JUST OSITIVE PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES BUT POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTHOUT COMES INCLUDING LOWER LEVELS OF ANXIETY IMPROVE SLEEP AND OVER ALL LEVELS OF MOOD THIS IS A TOPIC THAT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH IS LAST YEAR MY LABORATORY ITS TEMPHORAD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN COLLABORATION WITH A COLLEAGUE OF MINE DOCTOR DAVID SPEAGLE OUR ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF PSYCHITRY ALSO AT SAMPOR UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE PUBLISHED A CLINICAL TRIAL AND SELL REPORTS MEDICINE SHOWING THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF BREATHING THAT PEOPLE CAN DO FOR JUST FIVE MINUTES PER DAY THAT IS EFFECTIVE INSIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING VARIOUS METRICS RELATED TO MOOD AND REDUCING ANXIETY AND ALSO IMPROVING SLEEP ALTHOUGH I SHOULD SAY THE PROTOCOLUM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE DIDN'T UNIFORMLY IMPROVE ALL OF THOSE METRICS IT HAD A BIGGER EFFECT ON SOME VERSE AS OTHERS I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT STUDY IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS BUT IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT THIS PROTOCOL IS THAT PEOPLE DID FOR FIVE MINUTES O DAY THAT ALLOWED THEM TO BY THE WAY PERVASIVELY IMPROVE THEIR MOOD SO IT WASN'T JUST THEIR MOOD WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS FIVE MINUTE A PROTOCOL IT WAS IMPROVEMENTS IN M OD AROUND THE CLOCK ESSENTIALLY AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS IN OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THOSE SIX QARE PILLARS IT WAS THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL SIG THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE WE DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE DO JUST ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE WE HAD PEOPLE SET ASIDE FIVE MINUTES PER DAY SO SET A TIMER FOR FIVE MINUTES THEY COULD SIT OR LIE DOWN THEY COULD DO ANY TIME OF DAY AND WE JUST HAD THEM REPEAT THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE FOR A DURATION OF FIVE MINUTES TOTAL SAY THAT THEY WOULD DO TWO INHALS THROUGH THE NOSE AND THEN A FULL EXHILE TO LONGS EMPTY THROUGH THE MOUTH THAN THEY WOULD O W IT AGAIN AND THEN THEY WOULD DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THOSE FIVE MINUTES WERE COMPLETED AGAIN THE OUTCOME OF THAT CLINICAL TRIAL WAS THAT THAT PARTICULAR PATTERN OF BREATHING WHICH WE CALLED SYCLIC PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGHING FOR FIVE MINUTES PER DAY AGAIN DONE ANY TIME OF DAY HAD THE MOST POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF IMPROVING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTION THOSE THINGS RELATED TO SLEEP AND HEART RAT VERY ABILITY SO THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE VERY MINIMAL TIME AND VESTMENT ZERO COSTOOL THAT ANY ONE CAN USE THAT AGAIN IMPROVES VARIOUS MTRICS OF PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO IMPROVES METRICS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND IT TIES RIGHT BACK IN WITH WHAT WAS OBSERVED IN THE WORK BY DOCTOR LISA FELDMEN BEAR IT EXPLORING HOW PUTTING MORE WORD LABEL EMOTIONAL GRANULARITY ON ONE'S EMOTIONAL STATES POSIVELY IMPACT ORE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE AND THE FACT THAT THINKING ABOUT OUR EMOTIONS MORE FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND DELIBERATELY PUTTING MORE LABEL GRANULARITY ON THOSE EMOTIONS FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS CORRELAYED WITH THIS IMPROVEMENT IN RESPIRATORY SINESS A RHYTHMEA AT HEARTRATE VARIABILITY THE FACT THAT THESE THINGS ALL RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER SHOULD NOT SURPRISE US BECAUSE INDEED THERE'S A PREVIOUS PAPER THIS IS QUITE EXTENSIVE REVIEW ACTUALLY IT'S A VERY NICE REVIEWINTS ONE THAT I ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHOSE INTERESTED IN THESE TOPICS TO EXPLORE ESPECIALLY PSYC OLOGISTS WHO MIGHT HAVE A INTEREST IN PHYSIOLOGY OR PSYCHATUS OR SIMPLY PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MIND BODY STUFF THIS IS A REVIEW PUBLISH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN THE JOURNAL BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY ENTITLED CARDIAC VAGAL CONTROL AS A MARKER OF EMOTION REGULATION IN HEALTHY ADULTS A REVIEW AND AGAIN IT'S A REALLY WONDERFUL LITERATURE REVIEW OF THE PURE REVIEWED PRIMARY RESEARCH WHICH REALLY ESTABLISHES THAT THIS THING VAGAL TONE ARE A BILITY TO CAN PUT THE BREAKS ON OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SLOW OUR HEARTRAHE DOWN DELIBERATELY THROUGH OUR BREATHING AND PERHAPS EVEN JUST BY STOPPING AND REFLECTING ON WHAT ARE EMOTIONAL STATES ARE IS REALLY BENEFICIAL FOR OUR OVER ALL MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND I ON A HIGHLIGHT BOLD AND UNDERLINE THAT WORD OVER ALL BECAUSE IT'S NOJUST THE CASE THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE ELEVATED MOOD IND MENTAL HEALTH IN THE MOMENTS WHERE THEY STOPPING OOHOW AM I FEELING O YOU KNOW I MI FEELING IN A BORD OR AGITATED DO I FEEL PARTICULARLY EXCITED SURE THAT CAN HAVE SOME IMPACT ON PHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS AND MOOD AD MENTAL HEALTH BUT IN ALL OF THESE STUDIES THE OUTCOME SEEMS TO BE THAT PEOPLES OVER ALL LEVELS OF MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH ARE ENHANCE NOJIOUST WHILE THEYRE THINKING ABOUT THEIR EMOTIONS OR DOING THIS FIVE MINUT DAY PSYCLIC SIGHN BUT AROUND THE CLOCK WHICH IS REALLY TERRIFIC BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT MOST ALL OF US WANT WHICH IS IMPROVE MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH NOT JUST IN THE MOMENTS WHEN WE DO A PRACTICE OR IN THE FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS BUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY I SUPPOSE WE MIGHT SEGMENT OUT SLEEP DURING WHICH YOU KNOW FULLY WERE HAVING GREAT DREAMS AS OPPOSED TO  OTHER KINDS OF DREAMS BUT THE POINT IS EVERY ONE I HAVE TO IMAGINE WOULD LIKE TO FEEL BETTER AND HAVE ELEVATED MOOD ND MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE TIMES WHEN THEYARE WAKE AND INDEED THESE SORTS OF PROTOCALS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO DO THAT OR SO SAY THE SCIENTIFIC DATA NOW WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THE TOOLS FOR ENHANCING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH GLEANED FROM THE FOUR EPISODE GUEST SERIES WITH DOCTOR PAUL CONTI WHO IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR SPECIALIZING IN PSYCHIATRY HE ALSO HAS PARTICULAR EXPERT IECE IN TRAMA HOWEVER THE FOUR EPISODE GETS SERIES THAT WE DID WITH DOCTOR CONTI WAS REALLY ABOUT EXPLORING THE SELF AS WELL AS TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS FOR NOT JUST GAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ONE SELF BUT ALSO FOR GAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND TOOLS FOR RELATING TO OTHERS A C A RELATIONSHIPS THREAD THROUGH THE SERIES WAS A MODEL OF THE MIND AND HOW IT WORKS TO CREATE EVERYTHING FROM FEELINGS THOUGHTS TO BEHAVIORS THAT DOCTOR PAULCANTI DESCRIBED AS AN ICEBERG MODEL AND I PERHAPS SHOULD REFER YOU TO THE FACT THAT HE ECTUALLY DREW OUT THIS MODEL AND WE PROVIDED IT AS A ZERO COSTPDI F IN THE SHONOTE CAPTIONS FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE EPISODES IN THAT FOR EPISODE SERIES WE ALSO PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS MODEL IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS FOR THIS TOOLS EPISODE THE MODEL IS CALLED THE ICEBERG MODEL AND AS THE NAME SUGGESTS IT RESEMBLES AN ICEBERG IN WHICH THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MINDS PROCESSING OCCURS BELOW OUR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND SO THAT'S THE PORTION OF THE ICEBERG THAT RESIDES BELOW THE SURFACE WHEREAS THE PORTION OF OUR MENTAL PROCESSING THAT WE ARE AWARE OF RESIDES ABOVE THE WATER SURFACE THE SO CALL CONSCIOUS MIND SO A KEY ASPECT OF THE ICEBERG MODEL IS THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR FEELINGS THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS BUT THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE OF HOW THIS UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DOING THAT AND BY EXTENSION THE TOOLS AND PROTOCALS THET DOCTOR CONTI DESCRIBED LARGELY DEAL WITH GOING INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS AND FIGURING OUT HOW THE UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSING IS INFLUENCING OUR CONSCIOUS PROCESSING BOTH IN HEALTHY AND IN UNHEALTHY WAYS AND WHEN WE SAY IN HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY WAYS WE'RE LARGELY REFERRING TO THE PRESENCE OF DEFENCES SOME OF YOU V PERHAPS HEARD OF DEFENCES BEFORE SOME DEFENCES CAN INDEED BE HEALTHY AND OTHERS ARE UNHEALTHY THERE ARE DEFENSES SUCH AS PROJECTION SUBLIMATION DENIAL AND DURING THE CORSE OF THAT FOUR EPISODE SERIES DOCTOR CONTI EXPLAINS HOW PROJECTIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS BAD FOR US INDEED THEY CAN PROTECT US FROM PANIC FROM SEVERE TRAMA BUT THEY ALSO CAN CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN PROCESSING OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF SELF AND OF OUR LIFE EXPERIENCES IN WAYS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE DAMAGING TO US SO A KEY TAKE AWAY FROM THAT FOUR EPISODE SERIES IS TO UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DRIVING MUCH OF WHAT YOU FEEL THINK AND DO HOWEVER BY DOING STRUCTURED EXPLORATION OF THE SELF AND WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT ONE CAN GAIN BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSING IS INFLUENCING WHAT YOU THINK FEEL BELIEVE AND DO SO ONCE YOU ACCEPT THE IMPORTANT ROLL OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MINE AND YOU MAKE THE DECISION THAT YOU WANT A BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND CONSCIOUS MIND ARE IN THIS CONSTANT DIALOGUE AND HOW YOU CAN HAVE THAT DIALOGUE BETTER SERVE YOU THERE ARE SERIES OF ACTIONABLE TOOLS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND YOURSELF AND HOW YOU RELATE TO OTHERS AND THE FIRST OF THESE TOOLS IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND YOURSELF CONSEPT NOW OF COURSE WMOST ALL OF US KNOW OUR OWN NAME RARELY DO WE EVER FORGET THAT NAME WE HAVE SOME CONCEPT OF WHEREWERE FROM WHO OUR APPARENTS ARE WHAT OUR PRESENT AND FUTURE GOALS MIGHT BE WHERE WE'VE SUCCEEDED WHERE WE FAILED IN LIFE AND ON AND ON BUT THE SELF CONCEPT GOES FAR BEYOND THAT SORT OF C V LIST OUR OUR BIOGRAPHY OF SELF INDEED THE SELF CONCEPT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH OUR SELF CONFIDENCE OUR FEELINGS OF ABILITY BOTH TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES BUT ALSO OUR ABILITY TO SERVE THE WORLD THAT WERE IN AND OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE OURSELVES OVER TIME NOW OF COURSE THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE CONFIDENCE OR LESS CONFIDENCE OR THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOMEBODY FEELS THAT THEY CAN EXERT INFLUENCE ON THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR GOALS IS OF COURSE GOING TO VARY BASE ON THEIR PERSONAL HISTORY BUT AS DOCTOR CONTI EXPLAINED EVEN INDEPENDENT OF ALL THAT IF ONE PUTS IN SOME WORK TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR SELF CONCEPT TO REALLY GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF ONESELF FROM THAT ONE CAN DEVELOP MORE AGENCY WITH WHICH TO PURSUE ONE'S ATSPIRATION NS AND TO REACH THEIR GOALS AND THE KEY CONCEPT HERE IS ONE THAT'S PARTICULARLY POWERFUL FOR BOTH EXPLORING AND BUILDING UP ONCE CONCEPT OF SELF AND THAT'S THE CONSCIOUSLY AND DELIBERATELY BUILD A LIFE NARRATIVE NOW SIMPLE WAY TO DO THIS THAT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IS TO CREATE A SERIES OF FOLDERS OR DOCUMENTS IT COULD EVEN BE A STACK OF PAPERS I PREFER TO DO THIS AN ELECTRONIC FORM AND I CONFESS THAT EVEN BEFORE LEARNING ABOUT THIS TOOL FROM DOCTOR CONTY I HAD INITIATED DOING THIS TOOL STARTING BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND IT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT AS I MENTION BEFORE IT CAN BE VERY POWERFUL AND IT'S SIMPLY CONSISTS OF BUILDING OUT SEPARATE FOLDERS OR PIECES OF PAPER AND THIS COULD BE DONE ELECTRONICALLY OR ON REAL WORLD PAPER WITH PAPER AND PAN OR PAPER AND PENCIL AND ESENTIALLY WHAT YOU DO AS YOU'RE GOING TO DIVIDE YOUR LIFE HISTORY INTO SOME REGULAR INCREMENTS SO FOR ME THE WAY THAT I DID THIS AS I CREATED A FOLDER ON MY LAP TOP THAT I ACTUALLY CALL LIFETIME TAT'S THE TITLE OF THE MAIN FOLDER AND THEM WITHIN THAT FOLDER I'VE A SERIES OF FOLDERS EACH OF WHICH SPANDS A PARTICULAR PHASE OF MY LIFE SO ZERO TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE SIX TO TEN YEARS OF AGE ELEVEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH NOW I'M FORTY EIGHT YEARS OLD SO I HAVE FOLDERS THAT EXTEND TO AGE FIFTY CURRENTLY ALTHOUGH I WILL ADD FOLDERS GOING FORWARD VERY SOON AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT FOR EACH OF THOSE FOLDERS YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE A SINGLE WORD DOCUMENT INTO THAT FOLDER AND THEN ON THAT WORD DOCUMENT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JOURNAL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY SORT OF EXTENSIVE WRITING RATHER YOU'RE SIMPLY GOING TO PUT DOWN BULLET POINTS WITH TITLES IT COULD BE ONE OR TWO SENTENCEIS BUT TYPICALLY T JUST A FEW WORDS DESCRIBING SOME OF THE KEY MILESTONE EVENTS THAT YOU REMEMBER FROM THAT PARTICULAR PHASE OF YOUR LIFE SO JUST FORSAKE OF EXAMPLE I'LL READ OFF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLDERS FOR MY PARTICULAR LIFETIME NARRATIVE BUT OF COURSE THIS RELATES TO MY LIFETIME NARRATIVE YOU SHOULD OF COURSE PUT THE MILESTONES AND KEY BULLET POINTS THAT RELATE TO YOUR LIFETIME NARRATIVE BUT AGAIN JUST TO GIVE YOU A CEN S OF THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT MADE IT INTO THIS FOLDER IN MY SIX YEARS OLD TO ELEVEN YEAR OLD FOLDER I'M ON THAT DOCUMENTS I PUT WHERE I WAS LIVING AT THAT TIME THE CITY I WAS LIVING THE SCHOOL THAT I WENT TO I PUT A COUPLE OF TEACHERS NAMES A TEACHERS THAT HAD A PARTICULAR INFLUENCE ON ME I'M A PARTICULAR SUMMER CAMP EXPERIENCE IM THAT WAS NOT A DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE BY THE WAY WAS A HAPPY EXPERIENCE BUT FOR ME IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY TRANSFORMATIVE ONE AND THEN THERE ARE COUPLE OTHER THINGS IN THERE THAT ARE JUST RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOODS  FRIENDS NAMES  SO SEEMINGLY MONDANE INFORMATION PERHAPS BUT IT LOOKS MORE OR LESS LIKE A BIOGRAPHY AND YET OTHER FOLDERS SO FOR INSTANCE A THE FOLDER THAT SPANDS FROM TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ITIS THE TIME THAT I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL SOD INCLUDES A NOTE ABOUT GRADUATE SCHOOL A NOTE ABOUT PARTICULAR HOBBIES THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN IN ADDITION TO MY SCIENTIFIC RECEARCH AT THE TIME A COUPLE OF KEY RELATIONSHIPS A COUPLE OF KEY RELATIONSHIP CHALLENGES AS WELL AS SOME THINGS THAT AT THAT TIME I WAS PROCESSING ABOUT PRIOR YEARS IN PARTICULAR MYG TEEN YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW THE KEY THING HERE IS THAT WHATEVER GOES INTO THESE FOLDERS IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU IT COULD BE POSITIVE EVENTS IT COULD BE NEGATIVE EVENTS IT COULD BE EVENTS THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU REMEMBER AND KEEP SURFACING IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE INTERESTING OR IMPORTANT AT SOME LATER TIME OR THAT YOURE CONCERNED YOU MIGHT FORGET IN FACT THAT MIGHT BE A REALLY GOOD MATRIC FOR WHETHER NOT YOU INCLUDE SOMETHING THESE FOLDERS OR NOT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU NEVER FORGET BUT THAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT FORGET I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO PUT IT ON TO THAT WORD DOCUMENT AND PUT IT INTO THAT PARTICULAR FOLDER AGAIN THIS ISN'T ABOUT CREATING A COHERENT LIFE STORY THIS IS ABOUT CREATING A SERIES OF SEGMENTS OF SMALL COLLECTIONS OF KEY LIFE EVENTS POSITIVE NEGATIVE NEUTRAL INSPIRING BASICALLY ANYTHING THAT WAS SALIENT FOR YOU AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME AND OF COURSE IF YOU WANT TO PUT REFLECTIONS ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR EVENTS INTO THAT WORD DOCUMENT YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO DO THAT BUT THE BASIS OF THIS SELF CONCEPT DEVELOP ING EXERCISE IS JUST THAT IT'S TO DEVELOP A HISTORICAL SENSE OF YOURSELF OF COURSE BRINGING YOU UP TO PRESENT DAY WHERE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO ADD THINGS TO WHATEVER WERE DOCUMENT GOES IN TO THAT PARTICULAR FOLDER FOR THE AGE YOU HAPPEN TO BE NOW NOW FOR SOME OF YOU THIS KIND OF AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL BULLET POINTING MIGHT SEEM LIKE IT'S JUST THAT SOME ATTEMPT TO BUILD OR RIHT AND AUTOBIOGRAPHY BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THESE FOLDERS ARE FOR YOU THESE FOLDERS ARE NOT ABOUT WRITING A BOOK ABOUT YOUR LIFE HISTORY ALTHOUGH IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THAT WITH THESE FOLDERS AT SOME POINT DOWN THE LINE  THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT THAT'S NOT THE GOAL HERE THE GOAL IS FOR YOU TO BUILD A STRUCTURED NARRATIVE REPRESENTATION OF EVENTS THAT WERE KEY IN YOUR LIFE AND AS DESCRIBED IN THE SERIES WITH DOCTOR CONTY THIS GOES WAY BEYOND JUST UNDERSTANDING YOUR PAST THIS IS REALLY ABOUT UNDERSTANDING PAST IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF AT PRESENT AND INDEED IT THREADS INTO YOUR GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS FOR THE FUTURE AN IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS TOOL OR PROTOCAL IS THAT IT ALSO HAS A INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO ANCHOR YOU IN YOUR PERCEPTION OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME NOW SOME OF US TRACK THE PASSAGE OF TIME BETTER THAN OTHERS BOTH WITHIN THE DAY AND A CROSS DAYS AND YEARS AND SO FORTH BUT THIS EXERCISE IN PARTICULAR IS VERY GOOD AT ALLOWING YOU TO SEE OU KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU DEVOTED AT A GIVEN STAGE OF YOUR LIFE TO A GIVEN ENDEAVOR WHETHER NOT YOUR STUCKING PATTERNS WHEREBY YOUR STILL ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TYPES OF THINGS PROFESSIONALLY YOUR RELATIONSHIP WISE OR IN ANY OTHER NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HAVE YOU IN A PATTERN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE SERVING YOU WELL I WANT TO EMPHASISE AGAIN THAT THIS EXERCISE IS NOT ABOUT GOAL SETTING IT'S ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO BUILD A STRUCTURED NARRATIVE PATTERN FROM WHICH YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW YOU FEEL THAT YOUR CURRENTLY ON THE RIGHT PAST FOR YOU BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT PROJECTING FORWARD AS TO WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE WE'LL SOON TALK ABOUT THAT WEILL TALK ABOUT GOALS AND ASPIR ATIONS IN A MOMENT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT LED YOU UP TO THE PLACE THAT YOU ARE NOW AND IT REALLY HELPS YOU PIN POINT THE KEY WORK THAT YOU NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF EXPLORING YOUR UNCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUS MIND USING SOME TOOLS THAT WERE GOING TO GET INTO SUBSEQUENTLY SO THERE'S REALLY NO STRICT RULS ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS EXACTLY EXCEPT THAT I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE THOSE INCREMENTS ACROSS YOUR LIFE SPEND MANAGEABLE I WOULDN'T SUGGEST DOING IT ONE FOR EVERY YEAR I WOULDN SUGGEST A FOLD ARE O ONE FOR EVERY TEN YEARS I THINK OF THREE TO FIVE YEAR INCREMENTS SEEM LIKE A MORE REASONABLE AND TRACTABLE WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE SORTS OF TOOLS THAT DOCTOR CONTYO REFERRED TO AS TO HOW TO BUILD UP ONE'S SELF CONCEPT WHICH DIRECTLY RELATES TO THINGS SUCH AS AR CONFIDENTS ARE ABILITY TO TRACK OUR OWN BEHAVIOUR UNDERSTAND SOME OF OUR MOTIVATIONS BOTH CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS BUT OF COURSE THAT PRACTICE IS MAINLY A CONSCIOUS EXERCISE IT'S REALLY NOT TAPPING DIRECTLY INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS IN ANY KIND OF DIRECT WAY AS FAR AS WE KNOW NOW WE CAN CONTRAST THAT WITH THE TOOLS AND PROTOCALS THAT ARE DESIGN TO TAPPEN TO THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND ND OF COURSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN THAT FOUR EPISODE SERIES WITH DOCTOR CONTY BUT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WAYS TO DO THIS IS BY THINKING ABOUT AND INDEED SOMETIMES WRITING ABOUT OR EVEN ANALYZING ONE'S DREAMS NOW DREAM ANALYSIS OS SOMETHING FOR WHICH YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF BOOKS OUT THERE THER A LOT OF THEORIES THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF ARGUMENT THAT PERHAPS DREAM ANALYSIS WHICH HAS ROOTS IN FRORDI AN PSYCHOLOGY AS WELL AS OTHER TRADITIONS IS PERHAPS NOT ACCURATE I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER NOT DREAM ANALYSIS IS ACCURATE RATHER I THINK WE SHOULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHEN WE ARE DREAMING AND PARTICULAR THE DREAMS THAT WE HAVE TOWARD THE LATER PART OF OUR NIGHT WHICH ARE THE DREAMS ASSOCIATE WITH RAPID E MOVEMENT SLEEP THAT TEND TO BE VERY EMOTIONALLY LADEN DREAMS AS COMPARED TO THE DREAMS THAT WE HAVE EARLIER IN THE NIGHT WELL WHEN WE CONSIDER THE CONTENT OF THOSE DREAMS EVEN IF WE'RE NOT TRYING TO INTERPRET THEM IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE DREAMS REFLECT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND CONTROLLING MORE OF OUR INTERNAL DIA LOGUE OR WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING AT THAT TIME WHEREAS WHEN WE ARE AWAKE OUR CONSCIOUS MIND TENDS TO TAKE OVER MORE OF THE NARRATIVE THE INTERNAL NARRATIVE AND THE CONTROL OF OUR FEELINGS THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS BUT AS I MENTION BEFORE THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS ALWAYS EXERTING AN INFLUENCE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT WE ARE SLEEP OR AWAKE WITH THAT SAID ONE WAY TO EXPLORE THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND INTO BEGIN TO GET A BETTER UTTERSTANDING ABOUT HOW IT MIGHT BE INFLUENCING ARE WAKING STATES AND BEHAVIORS IS TO ACTUALLY RECORD AND THINK ABOUT ONE'S DREAMS NOW OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE REMEMBER THEIR DREAMS ON A REGULAR BASIS OTHER PEOPLE DON'T SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY DON'T DREAM STUDIES OUT OF SLEEP LABORATORIES AT STAMFORD UNIVERSIA PENNSYLVANIA HARVARD AND ELSEWHERE ALL GENERALLY AGREE THAT EVERYBODY DREAMS BUT NOT EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THEIR DREAMS SO IF YOUR INTERESTED IN TAPPING IN TO AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOUR DREAMS ARE TELLING YOU WHICH IS BASICALLY AWAY OF SAYING WHAT YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND OR DIALOGUE CONSISTS OF I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PUTTING A JOURNAL SO THIS WOULD BE ANY CONT OF PAPER AND PAN OR PAPER AND PENCIL TYPE JOURNAL AND THE IDEAS THIS IF YOU WAKE UP AND YOU CAN REMEMBER YOUR DREAM WRITE DOWN A FEW KEY BULLET POINTS FROM THAT DREAM IF YOU FEEL YOU CAN WRITE OUT THE DREAM IN A VERY  LINEOR NARRATIVE THIS HAPPENED THAN THAT HAPPENED AN THIS HAPPENED THAN THAT HAPPENED GREAT BUT MOST PEOPLE FIND THAT THEIR MEMORY OF THEIR DREAM IS RATHER FRAGMENTARY OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T REMEMBER THEIR DREAM OR AT LEAST THEY WAKE UP THEY FEEL LIKE THEY WERE HAVING A DREAM BUT THEY CAN'T REMEMBER ALL OF IT OR KEY COMPONENTS OF IT AND FOR THAT I SUGGEST THAT YOU TRY KEEPING YOUR BODY COMPLETELY STILL AND CLOSING YOUR EYES ONCE AGAIN WE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON DREAM RECOLLECTION IT SEEMS THAT BY KEEPING ONE'S BODY COMPLETELY STILL WITH EYES CLOSED WE HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO WHATEVER THE CONSTENTS OF THE DREAM THAT JUST OCCURRED WERE CA SO IF YOU WAKE UP AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER YOUR DR REAMS TRY LYING STILL FOR A FEW MINUTES AND KEEPING YOUR EYES CLOSED AND SEEING WHETHERE NOT THAT HELP SURFACE THE CONTENT OF THAT DREAM OTHER PEOPLE FIND THAT THEY GET UP THEY GET OUT OF BED AND THEN SOMETIME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING MAY BE EVEN LATER IN THE DAY THE CONTENTS OF A DREAM WILL JUST COME TO THEM WHILE IF THAT HAPPENS GREAT I ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU HAVE AWAY TO WRITE DOWN THE CONTENTS OF THE OF THAT DREAM NOW WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU DO THES SORT OF TOOL OR PROTO CALL I INCURAGE YOU TO BE WEARY OF ANY IMMEDIATE INTERPRETATION OF FOR INSTANCE OKAY ANIMALS IN A DREAM MEAN CHILDREN ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NOW THERE IS NOT A LOT OF SCIENCE THAT REALLY SUPPORTS THAT AS A FIRM STATEMENT AND OF COURSE THEIR BOOKS OUT THERE AND PODCASTS AND A TON OF INFORMATION TRYING TO HELP YOU INTERPRET YOUR DREAMS AND WHILE SOME OF THAT CAN BE FUN AND NOT ALL OF IT IS ENTIRELY USELESS THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO INTERPRET YOUR DREAMS THE GOAL HERE IS TO START RECORDING SOME OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS MAYBE EVEN THE ENTIRE NARRATIVE OF THE DREAMS THAT YOU HAVE JUST PRIOR TO WAKENG AS A WAY TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE THEMES THAT ARE OCCURRING AND RECURRING IN THE DIALOGUE THAT EXIST WITHIN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND SO A KEY ASPECT TO THIS TOOL IS THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY ONE DREAM AS AN ENORMOUSLY INFORMATIVE DREAM IT MIGHT BE BUT MORE IMPORTANT IN THIS PARTICULAR TOOL IS TO WRITE DOWN THE THEMES OF OUR PARTICULAR DREAM AND THEN SEE WHETHER NOT THOSE PARTICULAR THEMES RESURFACE AGAIN AND AGAIN A CROSS DIFFERENT NIGHTS OR A CROSS DIFFERENT DREAMS THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THINGS THAT ARE REPETING HUMATICALLY WILL SHOW UP AS DIFFERENT COMPONENTS IN DIFFERENT DREAMS BUT THAT BY KEEPING A DREAM JOURNAL YOU CAN START TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THESE PATTERNS THAT ARE OCCURRING FROM ONE DREAM TO THE NEXT AS OPPOSED TO HAVING THE SAME DREAM OVER AND OVER BUT THE POINT HEREIS TAT YOU CAN EXPLORE THE CONTENTS AND THE THEMES THAT'S REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT WORD HERE THE THEMES OF YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND THAT IS OCCURRING IF YOU START THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S RECURRING DURING YOUR DREAMS BECAUSE DREAMS ARE A TIME WHEN YOU'RE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DOMINATING THE NARRATIVE WITHIN YOUR MIND AND BRAIN NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DREAM A LOT AND REMEMBER YOUR DREAMS AS WELL AS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DO NOT I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXPLORE THE CONTENTS OF YOUR THINKING THAT IS THINKING ABOUT YOUR THINKING DURING SO CALL LIMINAL STATES AND THE LIMINAL STATE DURING WHICH THIS CAN BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL IS RIGHT UPON WAKING SO THIS IS DIFFERENT THIN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE DREAMING ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT KEEPING YOUR EYES CLOSED AND BODY STILL WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR DOING THIS WELL BECAUSE ONCE YOU START MOVING YOUR BODY YOU OPEN YOUR EYES AND YOU START BRINGING IN SENSORY EXPERIENCE FOR THAT DAY YOUR MIND DRAMATICALLY SHIFTS TOWARDS CONSCIOUS PROCESSANG BUT IN THAT LIMINAL STATE BETWEEN SLEEPING AND AWAKE YOU WAKE UP AND YOUR LITTLE SLEEPY MAY BE DON'T WANT TO GET OUT OF BED THAS HAPPENS TO ME ALL TOO OFTEN TRY CLOSING YOUR EYES AND REMAINING PERFECTLY STILL FOR MAY BE ONE TO THREE MINUTES MAY BE FIVE MINUTES AND JUST PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE YOUR MIND GOES NOW YOU MIGHT FALL BACK ASLEEP BE MINDFUL OF THAT DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT MORNING BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL FIND THAT THEIR MIND GOES IN TO THIS PLACE THAT'S NEITHER SLEEP NOR AWAKE BUT THIS IS A STATE THAT VERY MUCH RESEMBLES THE STATE PEOPLE ACHIEVE IN THINGS LIKE YOGANEDRA YOGA SLEEP OR IN NON SLEEP DEEP REAST ALTHOUGH IT TENDS TO BE MORE DOMINATED BY THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND A LITLE BIT MORE SLEEP LIKE NOW SOME PEOPLE FIND THIS PRACTICE TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT WAKE UP AN THEREARE JUST IMMEDIATELY READY TO GO MOST PEOPLE HOWEVER MYSELF INCLUDE TO FIND THAT WHEN THEY WAKE UP YOURE THE MIND ISN'T COMPLETELY ALERT YET AND YOU CAN USE THAT PERIOD AGAIN JUST MAY BE TWO OR THREE MINUTES MAY BE FIVE MINUTES TO START TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE CONTENTS OF YOUR THINKING SEE WHETHER NOT YOU'R THINKING MIGRATES FROM YOU KNOW SOMETHING RELATED TO WERK OR TO RELATIONSHIP OR TO SELF OR TO SOMETHING YOU WANTOD DO OR SOMETHING THAT YOUARE ANXIOUS ABOUT AND SO ON AND SO ON AND HERE TOO YOU'LL WANT A RIGHT THIS DOWN SO THIS IS VERY MUCH LIKE THE DREAM JOURNALLING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY EASY ERE FOR MOST PEOPLE TO ACCESS ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HARD TIME REMEMBERING THEIR DREAMS AND AGAIN IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS SOME OF THE CONTENTS OF YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO LEARN TO LOOK AT AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IN A WAY THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO UNLESS YOU'RE WORKING WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S VERY GOOD AT ACCESSING THE UNCONSCIOUS SUCH AS A SKILLED PSYCHATRIS OF PSYCHOANALYST AND IN THAT WAY ALLOWING YOU TO DO INTROSPECTIVE WORK WHICH IS NOT STRUCTURED IN TERMS OF THINKING TRYNATHING ABOUT LIKE WHAT I WAN WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW WHY DID THEY DO THAT WHY DID I REACT THAT WAY NOTHING LIKE THAT YOU'RE SIMPLY OBSERVING YOUR MIND AND SEEING WHAT'S GUISERING UP FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS THAT IS YOU'RE GETTING A PORTAL INTO THAT PORTION OF THE ICEBERG THAT RESIDES BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THE NEXT SET OF TOOLS FOR EXPLORING THE SELF SELF CONCEPT ET CETERA FROM THAT FOUR EPISODE SERIES WITH DOCTOR CANTI IS JOURNALING I'M GOING TO DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE TO THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST ABOUT JOURNALING AND THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF JOURNALING AND FORTUNATELY THER'RE A LOT OF GREAT PUREVIEWED STUDIES ABOUT THE POWER OF JOURNALING FOR PROCESSING ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE EMOTIONAL STATES TRAM ET CETERA HERE BUSILY TWO CATEGORIES OF JOURNALING THAT ARE VERY USEFUL TO CARRY OUT ON A CONSISTENT BASIS AND WHEN I SAY CONSISTENT BASIS THAT COULD MEAN EVERY DAY OR IT COULD MEAN THREE TIMES A WEEK COULD EVEN BE ONCE A WEEK TERE REALLY NO HARD IN FAST RULES ABOUT THIS BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT JOURNALING HERE REALLY TWO MAIN STYLES OF JOURNALING ONE IS GOING TO BE FREE ASSOCIET OF JOURNALING SOMETIMES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIS AS A DATA DUMP RIGHT TYPICALLY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE DATA DUMP AS THE MORNING NOTES WHICH IS WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW YOU GOT A LOT ON YOUR MIND YOU CAN'T ORGANIZE YOUR MIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HARD TIME STRUCTURING THEIR THINKING AND BEHAVIOUR OFTEN FIND THIS VERY USEFUL WHICH IS TO YOU KNOW TAKE OUT A JOURNAL OR A PIECE OF PAPER AGAIN THIS IS JUST FOR YOU IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU REALIZE AND REALLY  MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S GOING TO SEE THESE NOTES BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET INTO SELF MONITORING WHEN THEY ARE DOING THEIR JOURNALLING THER THINGG ABOUT WELL HOUSES GAN A LOOK IS MY HANDWRITING O CAY HAS BY PUNCTUATION WHAT ARE PEOPLE GOG TO THINK IS THIS GOING TO BE A GOOD BOOK OR NOT TO GO BUT LISTEN NONE OF THIS JOURNALLING THAT REFERRING TO IS ABOUT YOUR BOOK OR YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY THIS IS REALLY JUST FOR YOU THIS IS AN EXPLORATION OF YOURSELF THAT'S DESIGNE TO HELP YOU ENHANCE YOUR CONCEPT THAT IS YOURE UNDERSTANDING OFSELF AND INDEED TRANSLATES TO BETTER CONFIDENCE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR UNHEALTHY PATTERNS AND DEFENCES AND ON AND ON AND SO AGAIN THE TWO STYLES OF JOURNALLING ARE FREE ASSOCIATION SO R YOU LITERALLY JUST WRITE DOWN ANY THING THAT COMES TO MINE OR THAT YOU FEEL LIKE WRITING DOWN WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME FOR MOST PEOPLE TEN MINUTES IS AMPLE TIME TO DO THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE FIVE WILL BE ENOUGH AND FOR SOME WHO HAVE THE TIME MAY BE THIRTY MINUTES BUT FOR ME AND I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF THIS DATA DUMP FREE ASSOCIATION YOU IT COULD BE YOUR ANXIETIES WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ANXIOUS ABOUT REALLY COULD BE ABOUT ANY THING THAT COMES TO MINE AND THIS FREE ASSOCIATION PROCESS CAN BE VERY USEFUL FOR CLEARING OUT THE CLUTTER SO TO SPEAK THE OTHER STYLE OF JOURNALLING THAT'S EQUALLY USEFUL BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS IS STRUCTURE JOURNALING TO HAVE A GOAL FOR A GIVEN ENTRY ON A GIVEN DAY AND AGAIN THIS COULD BE DONE IN THE MORNING AFTERNOON OR NIGHT AND THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD SET AN INTENTION AND BY INTENTION I MEAN A SPECIFIC TOPIC THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RESTRICT YOUR WRITING TO AND THAT WRITING SHOULD BE ABOUT SELF IN PARTICULAR GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS WHAT YOU'VE WANTED IN THE PAST YES BUT ALSO WHAT YOU WANT AT PRESENT WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT IN THE FUTURE FOR YOURSELF THESE COULD OF COURSE BE MATERIAL THINGS BUT IN GENERAL THIS IS MORE ABOUT ASPIRATIONS OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACCOMPLISH OR GENERATE AND THE KEY WORD THERE IS GENERATE AND IF YOU LISTEN TO THE FOUR EPISODE SERIES WITH DOCTOR CONTY HE TALKED ABOUT THREE DRIVE S THAT EXIST IN ALL OF US THESE THREE DRIVES ARE THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THE PLEASURE DRIVE AND THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND WE DON'T NEED TO GO INTO AN LENGTHY DESCRIPTION ABOUT THESE DRIVES RIGHT NOW IF YOURE CURIOUS ABOUT THEM AND WHAT THEY REPRESENT AND AHOW THEY CAN BE IN BALANCE OR OUT OF BALANCE AND HOW THAT SERVES US OR DOESN'T SERVE US PLEASE CHECK OUT THAT FOR EPISODE SERIES WITH DOCTOR CONTY BECAUSE HE GOES INTO THAT IN A FAIR AMOUNT OF DETAIL AND ALSO IN ANACTIONABLE WAY BUT THE KEY THING HERE IS THAT WERE GENERATIVE YET ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ASK DOCTOR CONTY AT THE OUTSET AND THREUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SERIES WAS IU NO WANT IS MENTAL HEALTH YET WE TALK ABOUT PHYSICAL HEALTH AND WE HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT THAT REPRESENTS YOU KNO HEALTHY BLOOD PRESSURE THE ABILITY TO DO CERTAIN FORMS OF PHYSICAL MOVEMENT COGNIVABILITIES ITI ASKED HIM HOW CAN WED DEFINE MENTAL HEALTH AND HIS ANSWER WAS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND VERY POWERFUL HE SAID WHAT WE ALL NEED TO ASPIRE TO IS TO BE IN STATES THAT IS IN THE VERB ACTIONS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE FOR AS MUCH OF OUR WAKING LIFE AS POSSIBLE NOW THAT SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT A SENSE OF AGENCY THE ABILITY TO EXERT INFLUENCE OVER OUR INTERNAL STATE AND AFFECT THE WORLD AROUND US IN POSITIVE WAYS POSTIVE RELATIONSHIPS REACH OUR GOALS AS WELL AS GRATITUDE BEING GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'VE BEEN AFFORDED EVEN GRATEFUL PERHAPS FOR SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN AFFORDED OR THAT A WE'RE SELECTED FOR US THOUH WE HAD NO CONTROL OVER AND CURING THAT AGENCY AND GRATITUDE FORWARD BECAUSE IT GIVES RISE TO A SENSE OF PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT SO ALL OF THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL RIGHT BE AN AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS VERB STATES EXPERIENCE PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT BUT DOCTOR CONTY ACKNOWLEDGED AND WE SPENT A GOOD MOUNT OF TIME DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN JUST BECAUSE WE DECIDE WE WANT TO IN FACT AGENCY AND GRATITUDE PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT GUISOR UP FROM A WHOLE SET OF OTHER PROCESSIES THAT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN ON AR REGULAR BASIS AND THAT REALLY GETS US BACK TO THOSE THREE DRIVES HE TALKED ABOUT HOW PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE MORE OR LESS AGGRESSIVE DRIVE NOTJOUS AGGRESSION IN TERMS OF VIOLENCE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE DO HAVE THAT BUT IN TERMS OF THEIR DETERMINATION AND THEIR A SOR LEANING INTO FRICTION EVEN SEEKING OUT OF FRICTION PEOPLE ARE ON A CONTINUUM WITH RESPECT TO THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE YOU'LL TALKED ABOUT THE PLEASURE DRIVE AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE ON A CONTINUUM OF THE DESIRE FOR PLEASURE TO EITHER BE A HEDONIST OR SOMEBODY WHO REALLY AVOIDS PLEASURE AND CON RESTRICTS PLEASURE FROM ONESELF AND AGAIN THAT THESE THINGS CAN SLIDE AROUND DEPENDING ON OUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES OUR AGE ET CETERA BUT THAT IT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHERE WE ARE ON THAT CONTINUUM OF AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND A PLEASURE DRIVE AND THAT AND HERE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT OUR AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AN PLEASURE DRIVE NEVER OUTSIZE OUR GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THAT ENGAGING OUR GENERATIVE DRIVE IS REALLY THE HULMARK OF MENTAL HEAL THAT LEADS TO THAT SENSE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT AND HE DEFIND THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IN THE FOLLOWING WAY YOU SAID THE GENER OF DRIVE IS OUR DESIRE TO CREATE BUILD AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD IN MEANINGFUL WAYS AND APPRECIATE THE PROCESS TO GET THERE IT IS THE COOR FEATURE OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SO IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE VARIOUS DRIVES AND HOW THEY INTERACT AND HOW TO ACCESS MORE GENERATIVE DRIVE AGAIN THAT'S ALL CONTAINED IN THE FOUR EPISODE SERIES WITH DOCTOR CONTY BUT TAKING US BACK TO THE TOOLS AND TAKE AWAYS FROM THAT FOUR EPISODE SERIES THE PROCESS OF JOURNALING AND FREE ASSOCIATION MODE OR THE PROCESS OF JOURNALING IN A CONSCIOUS STRUCTURED WAY IS REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO ACCESS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND TO BUILD UP THAT GENERATIVE DRIVE AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ABOUT CONSCIOUS JOURNALING IS THAT IT AFFORDS US THE OPPORTUNITY IN A WAY THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE SEEN BY ANYBODY ELSE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS IVE NOW YOU MIGHT SAY OWI CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT MY GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT WELL THAT'S FINE THAN YOU SHOULD JOURNAL ABOUT THAT HOWEVER MOST PEOPLE HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NOT COMFORTABLE WITH WRITING THOSE THINGS OUT OR EVEN THINKING ABOUT THEM AN IF YOU REFLECT ON THAT HOW COULD IT EVER BE THAT YOU WOULD ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN FEELING COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT THEM AR WRITE ABOUT THEM AND SO THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT AND WRITING ABOUT YOUR GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE KEY FIRST STEPS TOWARDS BEING ABLE TO ACTUALIZE THOSE GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THIS MIGHT BE VERY EASY TO DO YOU SIMPLY WRITE DOWN SAY I WANT A YOU DON'T BE MARRIED BY THIS AGE AND I WANT TI YOU KNOT MAKE EX AMOUNT OF MONEY AND I WANT TO LIVE HERE OR THERE AND CERTAINLY THOSE SORTS OF GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS ARE PERFECTLY VALID FOR THIT'S TYPE OF EXERCISE BUT SO ARE THE SORTS OF GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS THAT RELATE TO FEELING STATES LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL PART OF A COMMUNITY I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL LIKE AN ACTIVE CONTRIBUTOR TO A COMMUNITY AND THEN THE ESSENTIAL THING IS TO REALLY FLESH OUT THE DETAIL AROUND THOSE GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS OU KNOW WHAT SIZE COMMUNITY A WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF FITTING INTO THIS COMMUNY ARE YOU DOING THIS ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE OR BY YOURSELF IN OTHER WORDS TO REALLY GET COMFORTABLE THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOUR GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS ARE AGAIN COMPLETELY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SELF AND THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE ONLY PERSON TO SEE THIS PARTICULAR DOCUMENT NOW I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT THE EXERCISE THAT IVE JUST DESCRIBED NOT THE FREE ASSOCIATION JOURNALING BUT THE STRUCTURE JOURNALING OF GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS I AND MANY PEOPLE FIND TO BE DIFFICULT TO INITIATE DIFFICULT TO INITIATE BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF INTERNAL ANXIETY IN FRICTION AROUND DOING IT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT KEEPS MANY NOT ALL BUT MANY PEOPLE FROM FEELING AS IF THEY ARE EVEN ALOUD TO THINK ABOUT THEIR GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE DEFAULT TOO WELL THEN OUN ALL JUST BE DISAPPOINTED CAUSE IT'S NOK IN TO WORK OUT I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I WANT BECAUSE THEN I'LL JUST BE MORE DISAPPOINTED AND THAT PARTICULAR FRAME OF MIND WAS ACTUALLY DISCUSSED IN THE SERIES WITH DOCTOR CONTY AND HE CONVINCED ME AND HE'S THE EXPERT THAT THE OPPOSITE IS ACTUALLY TRUE WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO OVERCOME SOME OF OUR ANXIETY AND REAL LY THINK ABOUT IN A DEDICATED WAY WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE FOR OURSELVES IN OUR LIVES BOTH PRESENT IN FUTURE AND KEEPING IN MIND ARE EVENTS OF PAST BECAUSE WE ALWAYS CARRY THAT LIFE NARRATIVE FORWARD THEN WE ARE IN A FAR BETTER PLACE TO ACTUALIZE THOSE CHOOLS AND ASPIRATIONS AND HE EXPLAINED A VARIETY OF REASONS WHY THAT'S THE CASE AND IS CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS AND SOME OF THE OTHERS OBSERVATIONSE THAT REALLY SUPPORT THAT STATEMENTS SO I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT EMBRACING A PROCESS OF JOURNALING AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY DAY THE JOURNALLING AND THE DREAM ANALYSIS TAKE A LOBIT MORE TIME BUT THEY ARE O SO VALUABLE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING ONESELF CONCEPT AND THEY REALLY THREAD FORWARD INTO REAL EVERYDAY ACTIONS THAT CAN POSITIVELY ENRICH YOUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH NOW ANY DESCRIPTION OF SIGN SPACED TOOLS FOR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH WOULD BE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT INCLUDING SOME TOOLS RELATED TO PROCESSING OF TRAMAS NOW THE PROCESSING OF TRAMAS IS SOMETHING THAT ESPECIALL IN THE CASE OF MAJOR TRAMAS WERE REPEATED TRAMAS REALLY SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN CONCERT WITH A EXPERT TRAINED CLINITION THAT IS A PSYCHOLOGIST ARE PSYCHIATRIST WHOSE TRAINED IN HELPING PEOPLE WORK THROUGH TRAMAS HOWEVER EVEN IF YOURE WORKING WITH SOMEBODY WHOSE EXPERT IN PROCESSING TRAMA THERE ARE SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE ON YOUR OWN TO ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING THROUGH WHAT ARE SOMETIMES CALLED MORE MINOR TRAMAS THESE ARE SOMETIMES CALLED BIG T BIG TRAMAS AND LITTLE T LITTLE TRAMAS HOWEVER IN THAT KNOMINCLATURE DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW MOST OF US CAN PROBABLY TELL WHAT THE BIG TRAMAS ARE FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OTHERS BUT SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TELL WETHER NOT THOSE SMALL TRAMAS THE LITTLE T TRAMAS ACTUALLY AR BIG T TRAMAS SO NOW THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY WORKING WITH THE LICENSE PROFESSIONAL IS REALLY GOING TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS AND IN MANY CASES NECESSARY TO WORK THROUGH TRAMA THAT SAID THE SELF DIRECTED PROTOCALS FOR WORKING THROUGH TRAMA HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH HOW WE THINK ABOUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AT TIMES HOW WE TALK ABOUT THOSE TRAMAS AND DOCTOR PALCONTI TALKED ABOUT THIS NOT SO MUCH IN THE FOUR EPISODE SERIES WITH US BUT IN A PARTICULAR PODCAST EPISODE THAT HE DID WITH DOCTOR PETER ATIA WHO SOME OF YOUR PERHAPS FAMILIAR WITH FOR HIS INCREDIBLE PODCAST THE DRIVE BUT ALSO FOR HIS EXCELLENT BOOK OUTLIVE WHICH DEALS WITH HELSPAN AND LIFE SPAN OR LONGEVITY NOW IN THAT PARTICULAR CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR CONTI AND DOCTOR ATIA DOCTOR CONTI EMPHASIZED THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE HOLD OURSELVES BACK AND IT HE CAN EXACERBATE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF TRAMA ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MODIFY OUR LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THOSE TRAMAS AND WHAT HE SAID WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT IS THAT OFTENTIMES WE DON'T ALLOW OURSELVES TO USE LANGUAGE THAT'S AS BIG AS IS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THAT TRAMA AND THE IMPACT THAT TRAMA ON US AND ON OTHERS IN FACT MANY PEOPLE START TO YOU KNOW RELEGATE THEIR LANGUAGE TO MORE PASSABLE IN A GIVEN SENTENCE OR PASSABLE IN A GIVEN CONVERSATION NOW WHAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE IDEA THAT OCCATING A SCREAMING AT SOMEBODY ELSE ABOUT YOUR TRAMA OR USING A LOT OF FOUR LETTER WORDS IS NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO PROCESS THAT TRAMA VERBILY HOWEVER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALLOWING ONESELF EITHER IN SPOKEN FORM OR IN WRITTEN FORM TO REALLY ALLOW THE MAGNITUDE OF A GIVEN TRAMA TO BE EXPRESSED WITH A FAIR DEGREE OF INTENSITY AND LANGUAGE THAT CAN CAPTURE AT LEAST SOME OF WHAT THAT TRMA REPRESENTED FOR US OR FOR OTHERS NOW AS DOCTOR CONTI POINTED OUT ALL TOO OFTEN WE DO THE OPPOSITE WHAT ENDS OF HAPPENING IS PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE SOME SORT OF TRAMA EITHER MAJOR OR MINOR MAY BE SINGULAR REPEATED TRAMA AND RATHER THAN BEING COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT IT RATHER THAN USING LANGUAGE THAT CAPTURES AT LEAST SOME OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT TRAMA FOR THEM PEOPLE START TO TALK ABOUT THAT TRAMA LESS FREQUENTLY THEY START TO DISTRACT THEMSELVES TO THINK ABOUT OTHER THINGS INSTEAD O OF TALKING ABOUT OR THINKING ABOUT THAT TRAMA AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT TRAMA ROOTS INTO OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND STARTS TO IMPACT US IN NEGATIVE WAYS NOW THOSE NEGATIVE WAYS INCLUDE INCREASES AN ANXIETY DESTRUPTIONS AND SLEEP IN FACT ONE OF THE COMMON WAYS IN WHICH TRAMA MANIFESTS AND DESTRUCTIONS AND SLEEP BY WAY OF ROOTING INTO OUR UNCONSCIOUS IS THAT PEOPLEWAKE UP AT TWO THIRTY OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WAS TO SAY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF BEING ASLEEP AND IMMEDIATELY THEIR THINKING ABOUT THAT THING THAT HAPPENED AND THEI'RE UPSET ABOUT IT THE IDEAS THAT WHEN WE PUSH THOSE TRAMAS DOWN WHEN WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM WITH PEOPLE THAT WE TRUST WHEN WE DON'T HAVE AWAY TO CONSCIOUSLY PROCESS THOSE TRAMAS USING LANGUAGE THAT AT LEAST PARTIALLY MATCHES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACT OF THOSE TRAMAS FOR US WELL THEN THOSE TRAMAS IMPACT OUR UNCONSCIOUS MINED WAYS THAT LEAD OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO LITERALLY WAKE US UP IN THE MIDDL THE NIGHT AND REMIND US OF THAT THING IT'S AS IF IT'S BEING THROWN BACK IN OUR FACE OVER AND OVER ALSO SOMETIMES TRMAS WILL ROOT THEIR WAY DOWN INTO OUR UNCONSCIOUS AND THEN THEY WILL RESURFACE IN THE MODE OF COMPULSIVE OR OBCESSIVE THINKING ABOUT THAT THING OR PERHAPS OTHER THINGS AGAIN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND HAS A INTERESTING AND COMPLICATED NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT IT DEFENDS US IN WAYS THAT IT YOU KNOW CAN CREATE DENIAL DISTRACTION THAT WE MIGHT GET HYPER FOCUSSED ON WORK AS A WAY TO NOT THINK ABOUT THE TRAMAR HYPER FOCUSSED ON SOME DETAILS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND JUST REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO PROCESS AND HANDLE THAT THAN THESE TRAMAS YOU KNOW AGAIN THE PROCESSING OF TRAMA IS A WHOLE LANDSCAPE INTO ITSELF THAT ACTUALLY WAS A BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF HOW IT ARISES WITHIN US AND HOW TO PROCESS TRAMAS IN A REALLY STRUCTURED WAY IN A JUST FABULOUS BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN BY DOCTOR CONTY CALLED THE INVISIBLE EPIDEMIC HOW TRAMA WORKS AND HOW WE CAN HEAL FROM IT AND IN THAT BOOK DOCTOR CONTY EXPLAINS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN DO SELF DIRECTED WORK AS WELL AS WORK WITH LICENSE PROFESSIONALS TO PROCESS TRAMAS AND HELP US MOVE THROUGH THOSE TRAMAS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING US GOING FORWARD SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE ANYONE THAT'S TRYING TO PROCESS TRAMAS FROM THE PAST AND WERE PRESENT TO CHECK OUT DOCTOR CONTI'S BOOK BECAUSE IT'S A SPECTACULAR RESOURCE BUT IN TERMS OF THE TOOLS RELATES O PROCESS IN TRAMA THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW THINK THIS POINT ABOUT REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO VERBALLY PROCESS AND EMOTIONALLY PROCESS THAT TRAMA IN A WAY THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR USING LANGUAGE THE CAPTURE SOME OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT TRMA AND HOW IT IMPACTED US AND OTHERS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHAT ENDS OF HAPPENING IS THAT WE TEND TO ADOPT FEELINGS OF GUILT AND SHAME AROUND THOSE TRAMAS SIMPLY BY NOT TALKING ABOUT THEM BY HAVING THEM GO INWARD AND THEN THEY START TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND THAN OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND TRIES TO THROW THEM UP TO THE SURFACE FOR OUR CONSCIOUS MIND TO RECOGNIZE BY WAKING US FROM SLEEP AND IN SOME CASES BY LEVERAGING THOSE UNHEALTHY DEFENCES THINGS LIKE DENIAL THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW THE OVER INDULGENCE IN ALCOHOL OVER INDULGENCE OF DRUGS WAYS TO DISTRACT OURSELVES AS WELL AS PROJECTION AND SUBLEMATION AND THE OTHER TYPES OF DEFENCES THE DOCTOR CONTY TALKED ABOUT IN THE FOUR EPISODE SERIES AGAIN THOSE DEFENSES ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOOD OR BAD IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS NOT TRYING TO HARM US YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS PART OF YOU IT IS YOU BUT OF COURSE IT IS YOU ACTING IN CONCERT WITH YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND AND SO REALLY THE TOOLS AND PROTOCALS FROM THE FOUR EPISODE SERIES WITH DOCTOR CONTI ARE AIMED AT HELPING YOU FEEL AND ACTSESS MORE SENSE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ON A REGULAR BASIS MORE PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT AND DOING SO BY TOUCHING IN TO THOSE DIFFERENT DRIVES UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY ARE THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THE PLEASURE DRIVE AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT YOUR GENERATIVE DRIVE CAN I LOVE THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE GENERATIVE DRA VE SO MUCH SO THAT I AM GOING TO READ IT AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MENTALLY HEALTHY AGAIN THE GENER DRIVE IS OUR DESIRE TO CREATE BUILD AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND APPRECIATE THE PROCESS TO GET THEIRE IT IS THE COOR FEATURE OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SO BEING ABLE TO ACCUS THAT GENERAIVE DRIVE ON A REGULAR BASIS IS REALLY WHAT THIS THING THAT WE CALL MENTAL HEALTH IS ALL ABOUT AND THE TOOLS THAT I JUST DESCRIBE OF COURSE CAN BE COMBINED WITH IN ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS WITH THE TOOLS THAT HAV DESCRIBED GLEAN LARGELY FROM THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR LISA FELDMAN BEAR IT AND SO WHAT YOU NOW HAVE IS A KIT OF TOOLS AND PROTOCALS FOR IMPROVING MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH SOME OF WHICH ARE GROUNDED IN THAT CORE SIX THE YOU KNOW FIRST PRINCIPLES OF SELF CARE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE GETTING YOUR PHYSIOLOGY RIGHT SO THAT YOUR PSYCHOLOGY CAN BE RIGHT AS WELL OF COURSE YOU WANT TO EMPHASIZED TOOLS AND PROTOCALS THAT BUILD UP YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN CONCEPT OF SEALTH THAT'S WHAT THE TOOLS FROM THE CAUNTI SERIES THAT WE JUST DESCRIBE ARE ALL ABOUT AND THEN THE TOOLS FROM THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR LISA FELDMAN BEAR IT SORT OF BRIDGE THE TOO BECAUSE SHE TALKS ABOUT BOTH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT REALLY REPRESENT WAYS TO ENHANCE OUR MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH AND SO BY THREADING THESE THREE THINGS TOGETHER I BELIEVE IT REALLY ARMS US WITH THE GREATEST DEGREE OF OPTIMISM AND CAPACITY TO TAKE CONTROL OF THIS THING THAT WE CALL OUR MOOD AND EMOTIONS AND TO COURSE ALLOW OURSELVES TO FEEL THE NEGATIVE THINGS WE NEED TO FEEL BUT THEN PROCESS THEM IN HEALTHY WAYS AND TO EXIST AS MUCH AS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE IN GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC UPBEAT STATES THAT ALLOW US TO ENGAGE ARE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND ALTHOUGH WE COVERED A LOT OF TOOLS DURING THIS EPISODE AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZED THAT THE IDEA ISN'TO NECESSARILY DO ALL OF THEM ALL AT ONCE MAY BE JUST PICK ONE OR TWO IN START TO IMPLEMENT THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS AND BY EMPLEMENTING THOSE THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY EATING INTO THE OTHER DEMANDS ON YOUR TIME BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING ELEVATED MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE BETTER RELATIONSHIP TO

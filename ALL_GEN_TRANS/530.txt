WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAPONCAS  SCIENCE SCIENCE ACE TO FRAMY NAME IS ANDREW HUBERMEN AND IM A PROFESSOR OF NUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSERS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL F MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK OM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THE'LL GIVE YOU FIE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT INVITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'L GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT TE DOTCALM SLASH HUBERM THIS MONTH WERE TALKING ALL ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF EMOTIONS AND TOOLS RELATED TO THE SCIENCE OF EMOTIONS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF STRESS AND RESILIENCY TOOLS TO ACCESS MORE CALM TOOLS TO RAISE YOUR STRESS THRESHOLD TO BECOME MORE RESILIENT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MOTIVATION AND THE ROLL OF THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM ID LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT SOME NEW RESOURCES THE FIRST ONE IS THAT WE HAVE NOW CAPTION ALL THE HUBERMAN LAB EPISODES IN ENGLISH END IN SPANISH WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT THANKS TO YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR SPONSORS AND ON PATRION SO NOW ALL OF THE PODCASTS HAVE A CAPTIONING FEATURE ON YOU TO AND THOSE WERE DONE BY EXPERTS SO WHILE THERE MIGHT BE THE OCCASIONAL ERROR FOR THE MOST PART THEIR VERY PRECISE WE'VE DONE THAT SO THAT PEOPLE THAT PREFERR TO CONSUME THE CONTENT IN SPANISH WHER THAT LIKE TO READ THE CONTENT FROM THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES CAN DO SO AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF LANGUAGES THAT ARE CAPTION FOR THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST O WE WANT A THANK YOU FOR THAT RESOURCE IT'S NOW AVAILABLE FOR ALL EPISODES IN ADDITION AND PREVIOUS EPISODES I'VE TALKED ABOUT INS D AR OR NON SLEEP DEEP REST N S DRS COME IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FORMS THEIR'S SELF EPNOSIS I'VE POINTED YOU TO SOME RESOURCES FOR THAT PREVIOUSLY THERE'S YOGANEDRA N S DAR IS REALLY ABOUT ACHIEVING CALM QUICKLY AND DOING THAT IN A SELF DIRECTED WAY FOR MANY REASONS IN ORDER TO ACCESS SLEEP MORE READILY IN ORDER TO DESTRESS VERY DEEPLY IN ORDER TO REPLACE SLEEP THAT YOU'VE LOST IT ALSO SEEMS TO AID NERL PLASTICITY IT CAN ENHANCE THE REARRANGEMENTS OF CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN THAT OCCURRD DURING LEARNING THEIR SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR THAT THERE'S A LINK IN TO DAYS EPISODE CAPTION TO A NEW SIT THIS IS A UTU VIDIO THAT WAS BROUGHT FREE OF COST BY THE FOLKS OVER IT MADE FOR ACCOMPANY THAT'S BIN A SPONSE OR THE PODCAST PREVIOUSLY SO THIS IS AN N S DAR SCRIPT THAT DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY OF THE INTENTIONS OR SOME OF THE MORE TYPICAL LANGUAGE OF YOGANEDRA INSTEAD ITS FOCUST PURELY ON THE BREATHING PROTOCALS AS WELL AS INCLUDES A SORT OF BODY SCAN WE DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AROUND YOUR BODY IT HAS ALL THE CORE ELEMENTS OF NON SLEEP DEEP REST BUT IS DISTINCT FROM YOGANEDRA I JUST OFFER THIS TO YOU AS A RESOURCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO USE IT IT'S ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES LONG AND SHOULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN BRINGING YOU INTO DEEP STATES OF RELAXATION FOR ALL THE REASONS I MENTION BEFORE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT EMOTIONS EMOTIONS ARE A FASCINATING AND VITAL ASPECT OF OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT EMOTIONS T MAKE UP MOST OF WHAT WE THINK OF AS ARE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE EVEN THE THINGS WE DO OUR BEHAVIORS AND THE PLACES WE GO IN THE PEOPLE WE AND UP ENCOUNTERING IN OUR LIFE ALL OF THAT REALLY FUNNELS INTO OUR EMOTIONAL PERCEPTION OF WHAT THOSE THINGS MEAN WHETHER NOT THEY MADE US S HAPPY OR SAD OR D EPRESSED OR LONELY OR WERE AWE INSPIRING NOW ONE THING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IS THAT EVERY ONE'S PERCEPTION OF EMOTION IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MEANING YOUR IDEA OF HAPPY IS VERY LIKELY DIFFERENT THAN MY IDEA OF WHAT A STATE OF HAPPINESS IS AND WE KNOW THIS ALSO FOR COLOR VISION FOR INSTANCE EVEN THOUGH THE CELLS IN YOUR EYE AND MY EYE THAT PERCEIVE THE COLOR RED ARE IDENTICAL RIGHT DOWN TO THE GENES THAT THEY EXPRESS WE CAN BE CERTAIN BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE AN WHAT ARE CALLED PSYCHO PHYSICAL STUDIES THAT YOUR IDEA OF THE MOST INTENSE READ IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY IDEA OF THE MOST INTENSE RED IF WE WERE GIVEN A SELECTION OF TEN DIFFERENT READS AND ASKED WHICH ONE IS MOST INTENSE WHICH ONE LOOKS MOST RED AND THAT SEEMS CRAZY YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS COLOR WOULD BE UNIVERSAL AND YET IT'S NOT AND SO WE NEED TO AGREE AT THE OUTSET THAT EMOTIONS ARE COMPLICATED AND YET THEY ARE TRACTABLE THEY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EMOTIONS ARE FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR EMOTIONAL STATES MEAN AND WHAT THEY DON'T MEAN AND IN DOING THAT THAT WILL ALLOW YOUE TO PLACE VALUE ON WHETHER NOT YOU SHOULD HOLD AN EMOTIONAL STATE AS TRUE OR NOT TRUE WHETHER NOT IT HAS MEANING OR IT DOESN'T AS WELL AS WETHER NOT THE EMOTIONS OF OTHERS ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU IN A GIVEN CONTEXT WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT DEVELOPMENT IN FACT WE'RE GONG A CENTR A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSION TO DAY AROUND INFANCY AND PUBERITY WE'RE ALSO GIN TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS FOR ENHANCING ONE'S EMOTIONAL RANGE AND FOR NAVIGATING DIFFICULT EMOTIONAL SITUATIONS I AM NOT A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST I'M NOT A THERAPIST BUT I DO HAVE SOME BACKGROUND IN PSYCHOLOGY AND TO DAY I'M GOING TO BE DRAWING FROM THE PSYCHOLOGY GRATS NOT ME BUT FROM THE GRATS OF PSYCHOLOGY WHO STUDIED EMOTION WHO STUDIED EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LINKING THAT TO THE NURL SCIENCE OF EMOTION BECAUSE NOWADAYS WE UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT THE CHEMICALS AND THE HORMONES AND THE NURAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN IN BODY THAT UNDERLIE EMOTION SO WHILE THERE'S NO ONE SINGLE UNIVERSALLY TRUE THEORY OF EMOTION AT THE INTERCEPTION OF MANY OF THE EXISTING THEORIES THEREARE REALLY SOME GROUND TRUTH SO TODAY WE'RE GOING O VISIT THOSE GROUND TRUTHS WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS THAT EMERGE FROM THEM AND WE'REGOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME ABSOLUTELY WILD AND WACKY EXPERIMENTS THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THAT I DON'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND YOU DO OF INHALING DIFFEREN TYPES OF HORMONES AND TRYING TO GET ATTACHED MORE QUICKLY YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO SOME EXPERIENTIAL STUFF TODAY IF YOU LIKE THEARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN REAL TIME WHILE LISTENING TO THE PODCAST IN ORDER TO TAP IN TO SOME OF THE MECHANISMS THAT ALL BE REFERRING TO SO TODAYS CAN BE VERY INTERACTIVE IN A WAY THAT PREVIOUS PODCASTS EPISODES HAVE NOT IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND EMOTIONS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE EMOTIONS FIRST DEVELOP IN FACT THIS IS A CRITICAL SENTIAL THEME IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND BRAIN SCIENCE AN PSYCHOLOGY THERE'S A RULE IN NURONATOMY BEC AUSE IF YOU LOOK AT FIFTY DIFFERENT BRAINS OF HUMANS OR YOU COMPARE THE BRAINS OF DOGS IN HUMANS THER'RE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES CERTAIN THINGS ARE THE SAME BUT CERTAIN THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AND THE RULE THAT EVERY GOOD NUROONATOMIST KNOWS IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A PART OF THE BRAIN DOES YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS TWO QUESTIONS FIRST YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT CONNECTIONS DOES THAT BRAIN AREA MAKE WHAT IS IT CONNECTED TO WHERE DOES IT GET INPUTS FROM AND WHERE DOES IT SENDIN PUTS SO FOR INSTANCE IF THERE'S AN AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT GETS DIRECT IMPUT FROM THE NURONS IN THE KNOWS YOU CAN BE PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT HAS SOME ROLL IN ANALYZING SMELL IN MEASURING SOMETHING ABOUT ODORS ARE ANALYZING SOMETHING ABOUT ODORS NOW IF IT ALSO GETS IN PUT FROM THE EYE YOU CAN ALSO CONCLUDE THAT IT GETS IN PUT FROM THE VISUAL SYSTEM THAT IT CARES ABOUT LIGHT AND PHOTONS THIS THE SORT OF OBVIOUS AND YET YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT CONUCTIVITY AND YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S CALLED THE DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGIN OF THAT STRUCTURE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE IT WAS EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THINGS MOVE AROUND A LOT AS THE BRAIN DEVELOPS THE BRAIN OF COURSE IS THIS MORE OR LESS SQUISHY THING FLOATING AROUND IN SOME LIQUID THAT STUFFED INSIDE YOUR SKULL AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THINGS MOVE AROUND A LOT THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS IN THE SAME PLACE IN TO OF DIFFERENT SPECIES OR TO INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME SPECIES SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THEY STARTED OUT BECAUSE WHERE THEY STARTED OUT IN FORMS WHAT THEY DO AS WELL AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EMOTIONS WE CANNOT POINT TO ONE AREA OF THE BRAIN WE CAN'T SAY THAT'S THE AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR EMOTIONS THERE IS THE SO CALLED LIMBIC SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN LINKED TO EMOTIONS IN VARIOUS WAYS WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT TO DAY BUT THE LIMBIC SYSTEM IS JUST ONE COMPONENT OF THE IMPUTS TO CREATE EMOTIONS IT'S NOT THE PLACE FOR EMOTIONS YOU CAN'T GO IN IN LESION ONE LOCATION IN THE BRAIN AND ELIMINATE EMOTIONS ENTIRELY JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY SO FIRST OF ALL WEU HAVE TO ASK WHAT ARE THE CIRCUITS FOR EMOTION WHAT ARE THE BRAIN AREAS FOR EMOTION AND NOWADAYS TERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THERE MIGHT BE CIRCUITS MEANING CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN THAT GENERATE THE FEELING OF BEING HAPPY OR CIRCUITS THAT GENERATE THE FEELING OF BEING SAD ET CETERA THAT'S BEEN CHALLENGED IN FACT LESA FELDMEN BAR IT HAS BEEN THE PERSON WHOS REALLY CHALLENGE THIS HEAD ON AND HAS VERY GOOD EVIDENCE FOR THE FACT THAT SUCH CIRCUITS PROBABLY DON'T EXIST AND YET I THINK THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE FOR CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN SUCH AS LIMBIC CIRCUITS AND OTHER CIRCUITS THAT SHIFT ARE OVER ALL STATES OR ARE OVER A LEVEL OF ALERTNESS OR CALMNESS OR WHETH THER'RE NOT THEY BIAS US TOWARD VIEWING THE OUTSIDE WORLD OR PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OUR BODIES IF NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE RIGHT NOW I PROMISE IT WILL MAKE SENSE SOON BUT THE IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IN MOTIONS DO ARISE IN THE BRAIN AN BODY THEY ARISE BECAUSE THERE ARE SPECIFIC CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SPECIFIC AREAS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW IN M OCEANS WORK WE HAVE TO LOOK HOW EMOTIONS ARE BUILT AND THEY ARE BUILT DURING INFANCY ADOLESCENCE AND PUBERTY AND THEN IT CONTINUES INTO ADULTHOOD BUT THE GROUND WORK IS LAID DOWN EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT WHEN WE ARE SMALL CHILDREN SO LET'S THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A BABY THAT COMES INTO THE WORLD A BABY COMES INTO THE WORLD YOU WERE BORN INTO THIS WORLD WITHOUT REALLY ANY UNDERSTANDING OF THE THINGS AROUND YOU NOW THERE TWO WAYS THAT YOU CAN INTERACT WITH THE WORLD AND YOU 'RE ALWAYS DOING THEM MORE OR LESS TO SOME DEGREE AT THE SAME TIME THOSE ARE INTERRECEPTION PAYING ATTENTION WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE YOU WHAT YOU FEEL INTERNALLY AND EXTRAECEPTION PAYING ATTENTION WHAT'S GOING ON OUTSIDE YOU HOLD THAT IN MIND PLEASE BECAUSE THE FACT THAT YOU ERE BOTH IN TERRACEPTING AND EXTRAACEPTING IS TRUE FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND IT SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONS ITS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AS AN INFANT YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT YOU NEEDED YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HUNGER YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND TOYS WHEN YOU FIRST CAME INTO THE WORLD YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND COLD OR HEAT OR ANY OF THAT WHEN YOU NEEDED SOMETHING YOU EXPERIENCE THAT AS ANXIETY YOU WOULD FEEL AN INCREASE IN ALERTNESS IF YOU HAD TO USE THE BATHROOM YOU WOULD FEEL AND INCREASE IN ALERTNESS IF YOU WERE HUNGRY AND YOU WOULD VOCALIZE YOU WOULD CRY OUT YOU WOULD ACT AGITATED YOU MIGHT COO YOU MIGHT DO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT ALL YOU KNEW WAS WHAT YOU WERE FER FEELING INTERNALLY AND THEN YOUR CARGIVER WHOEVER THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WOULD RESPOND TO THAT SO YOU WOULD FEEL SOME AGITATION A CAR GIVER WOULD COME AND MAKE A DECISION OH YOU NEED FOOD AND GIVE YOU MILK OR CHANGE YOUR DIPER OR RAP YOU IN A BLANKET IF YOU WERE COLD BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE COLD THEY COULD JUST ASSUME THAT YOU WERE COLD SOTIS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT A BABY WHEN YOU WERE A BABY AND WHEN I WAS A BABY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD EXCEPT THAT IT RESPONDED TO OUR ACTS OF ANXIETY ESSENTIALLY NOW THIS IS AN PHROIDIAN THEORY RIGHT ITS IT THERE R COMPONENTS OF IT THAT OR METTED IN FROIDIAN THEORY BUT ALL DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGISTS AGREE THAT BABIES LACK THE ABILITY TO MAKE COGNATIVE SENSE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD BUT IN THIS FEELING OF ANXIETY AND REGISTERING ONE'S OWN INTERNAL STATE AND THEN CRYING OUT TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD EITHER THROUGH CRYING OR SUBTLE VOCALIZATIONS OR EVEN JUST COOING MAKING SOME NOISE WE START TO DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN WHICH OURE INTERNAL STATES ARE SHIFTS AN ANXIETY START TO DRIVE RE CUESTS AND PEOPLE COME AND RESPOND TO THOSE REQUESTS HOPEFULLY AND THE REASON I SAY HOPEFULLY IS THAT WE'VE ALL HEARD PRESUMABLY ABOUT THESE CASES OF NEGLECT THERE ARE LOT OF CASES WHERE IF YOU NEGLECKED A BABY IU NEGLECT AN ADOLESCEINTERATEEN AGUR DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T GO WELL AND WILL TOUCH ON SOME OF THOSE BUT THOSE ARE REALLY EXTREME CASES THEYRE SORT OF LIKE THE APARALLEL TO EXPERIMENTS THAT ARE OFTEN DONE IN THE LABORATORY WITH ANIMALS WHERE YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF THESE ENRICHED ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY'LL GIVE MY E SABUNCH OF TOYS AND THEY'LL GIVE THEM OM  SOME DIFFERENT FOODS EVERYONCE IN A WHILE HEY' HOUSE THEM TOGETHER WITH OTHER MICE AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE ANIMALS THEY WILL SAY OH YOU KNOW THEIR BRAIN IS THICKER AND THEIR NURANS HAVE MORE BRANCHES TO THEM IN ALL THAT BUT THAT'S REALLY COMPARING DEPRIVATION WITH NORMAL SY WHAT WE WANT A CENTER ON TO DAY INSTEAD IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS GO WELL AND WHY THINGS MIGHT NOT GO WELL IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INTERESTING BUT TO ME NOT AS INTERESTING AS WHAT HEALTHY EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT LOOKS LIKE AND IF YOU HAVEN'T ACHIEVED HEALTHY EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHAT CAN BE DONE AS AN INTERVENTION AT LATER TIMES IN ORDER TO RESCUE THAT SO THE BABY YOU AS A BABY YOURE FLOPPING AROUND THERE IN YOUR CRIB YOURE GETTING CARE WHERE YOU WHERE YOU NEED IT AND WHEN YOU NEED IT PRESUMABLY AND THIS GETS TO THE BASIS OF WHAT EMOTIONS ARE ABOUT WHICH AR EMOTIONS ARE REALLY ABOUT FORMING BONDS AND BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT'S REALLY WHAT EMOTIONS ARE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE BABY FEELS ANGRY OR HAPPIER SAT WE DON'T KNOW WE CAN GUESS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IN FACT MOST TOF TIME WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW WE FEEL LET ALON HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL AND THAT'S TRUE FOR ADULTS SO IF I ASK YOU HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD TELL ME IN ANY KIND OF RICH LANGUAGE THAT WOULDS I WOULD SAY OH I REALLY UNDERSTAND IF YOU SAID YOU WERE VERY VERY DEPRESSED ARE VERY VERY HAPPY I'D HAVE SOME SENSE BECAUSE OF HOW EXTREME THAT IS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD REALLY KNOW AND I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW EITHER I COULD BE FURIOUS RIGHT NOW OR I COULD BE VERY HAPPY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA OF COURSE WE HAVE THESE THINGS CALLED EXPRESSIONS OUR PUPILS DILATE THEIR VERIEST CUES OF HOW PEOPLE FEEL WERE IN A TALK ABOUT THOSE CUES BE REALLY DON'T KNOW AND AT THIS POINT I ACTUALLY JUST WANT A PAUSE AND MENTION A REALLY INTERESTING TOOL THAT IT'S TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION OF WHAT OUR EMOTIONS AND WHAT ERE THEY CONSIST OF THAT YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIKE THIS IS AN AP I DIDN'T DEVELOP IT I DON'T HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THEM BUT THE AP WAS DEVELOPED BY PEOPLE AT YALE UM BY GROUPS AT YALE WHO DO RESEARCH ND IT'S CALLED MOOD METER AND IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE INTERESTING I THINK IT'S EITHER FREE OR ITS NINETY NINE SENSE AGAIN O NO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP TO THEM BUT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS PUT MORE NEU ANTS MORE SUBTLETY ON OUR WORDS AND OUR LANGUAGE FOR FOR EMOTIONS AND BE ABLE TO TO ALLOW YOU TO PREDICT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL IN THE FUTURE AN'S ICHUALLY QUITE INTERESTING I'M ON THE APRIGHT NOW AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE THIS BUT OM IT'S CALLED MOOD MEATER AND OM YOU CAN FIND ON APPLE ARE ENDROYED AND YOU GO INTO IT AND ASK YOU NOW IT SAYS TO ME HIGH ANDREW HOW ARE YOU RIGHT NOW AND I CLICK THE TABE THAT SAYS I FEEL AND I CAN EITHER PICK HIGH ENERGY AND UNPLEASANT HIGH ENERGY AND PLEASANT LOW ENERGY UNPLEASANT OR LOW ENERGY PLEASANT AND I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW I FEEL HIGH ENERGY PLEASANT SO I JUST REVEAL S YOU I FEEL SO I CLICK ON THAT AND THEN IT GIVES YOU A GALLERY OF COLORS AND YOU JUST MOVE YOUR FINGER TO THE LOCATION WHERE YOU THINK IT MATCHES MOST AND AS YOU DO THAT LITTLE WORDS POP UP I KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THIS ON OUT OR LISTENING THIS ON AUDIO ONLY SO SAY MOTIV ATED CHEERFUL INSPIRED I WOULD SAY I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW CHEERFUL SO YOU CLICK THAT AND THEN YOU JUST GO TO THE NEXT WINDOW IN IT JUST AS WHAT YOU DOING AND I THIS FEELS LIKE PLAY TO ME BUT I'M N A CALL IT WORK AND THEN THAT'S IT AND THEN ON WHAT IT DOES IS IT BASICALLY STARTS TO COLLECT DATA ON YOU YOU'RE GIVING IT INFORMATION AND IT STARTS TO LINK THAT TO OTHER FEATURES THAT YOU ALLOW IT ACCESS TO IF YOU LIKE AND IT STARTS HELPING YOU BE ABLE TO PREDECT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL AT DIFFERENT TIMES TO DAY ESPECIALLY QUITE ACCURATE N ON  CERTAIN WAYS QUITE INTERESTING AND IT POINTS TO A COUPLE REALLY INTERESTING FEATURES WHICH IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ENOUGH LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE ALL THE EMOTIONAL STATES AND YET THERE' SOME COR TRUTHS TO WHAT MAKES UP IN EMOTION AND I WANT A REVIEW THAT TWICE DURING TO DAY'S PODCAST BECAUSE THIS CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE KID'S AN ADULTS UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THEIR FEELING AND WHY AND WHEN BEST TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND THANKFULLY WHEN BEST TO AVOID CERTAIN ACTIVITIES TOO SO THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THE FOLLOWING YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF AT ANY POINT YOU CAN DO THIS RIGHT NOW IF YOU LIKE WHAT'S YOU'R LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AUTONOMIC AROUSAL IS JUST THE CONTINUUM THE RANGE OF ALERT TO CALM SO IF YOU'RE IN A PANIC RIGHT NOW YOU ARE A TEN AT A TEN ON THE AROUSAL SCALE IF YOU'RE ASLEEP YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT COMPREHENDING WHAT I'M SAYING ALTHOUGH MY BE A LITTLE BIT BUT LET SAY YOURE VERY DROWSY YOU MIGHT BE AT A ONE OR A TOO SO YOU YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO ASK WERE YOU ON THE AROUSAL SCALE AND THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER ACIS THIS OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT WE CALL VAILANCE NOW VEILANCE IS OF VALUE DO YOU FEEL GOOD OR BAD I WOULD SAY I FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW AND A SCALE O ONE TO TEN I MIKE A AUNO I FEEL LIKE A SEVEN GOT GOOD NIGHT SLEEP LAST NIGHT AT A GOOD WALK WITH COSTELLO THIS MORNING ITED A HYDRATED I FEEL GOT SOMETHING A SEVEN SOME ALERT AND I FEEL PRETTY GOOD AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD THING WHICH IS HOW MUCH WE ARE INTERROCEPTING AND HOW MUCH WE ARE EXTERROCEPTIN I O HOW MUCH OUR ATTENTION IS FOCASSED INTERNALLY ON WHAT WE'RE FEELING AND HOW MUCH ITS FOCASSED EXTERNALLY AND THIS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE IN A DYNAMIC BALANCE SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE REALLY REALLY STRESSED OFTENTIMES THAT PUTS YOU IN A POSITION TO BE REALLY IN TOUCH WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY IF YOU START HAVING A LOT OF SOME MATIC A LOT OF BODILY SENSATIONS LIKE YOUR HEART IS BEATING SO FAST THAT YOU CAN'T IGNORE IT THEN YOU'RE REALLY STRONGLY IN TERROCEPTIVE BUT ALSO SOMETIMES YOU'RE REALLY STRESSE BECAUSE SOMEONE STRESSING YOU OUT OR SOMEBODY SENDS YOU A TAX MESSAGE OR MAKES A COMMENT ABOUT A OUTUBE THING YOU POSTED OR SOMETHING AND YOU'RE REALLY TRIGGERED BY IT THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME BUT IT IF IT DOES HAPPEN TO YOU THEN YOURE EXTEROCEPTING SO T THESE THREE THINGS HOW ALERT OR SLEEPI YOU ARE THAT'S ONE HOW GOOD OR BAD YOU FEEL THAT'S TOO AND THEN WHETHER NOT MOST OF YOUR ATTENTION IS DIRECTED OUTWARD OR WHETHER NOT SDIRECTED INWARD AND MUCH OF WHAT WE CALL EMOTIONS ARE MADE UP BY THOSE THREE THINGS AND SO LET'S RETURN NOW TO DEVELOPMENT BUT TUCK THAT AWAY AND JUST KIN O THINK ABOUT IT ALERT VERSES ASLEEP GOOD VERSES BAD AND FOCUSTD INTERNALLY OR FOCUS EXTERNALLY BECAUSE WHEN I LOOKD AT THE WHOLE OF THE OF ALL THE THEORIES OF EMOTION THAT WERE OUT THERE THERE WER LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO THEM BUT THEY ALL SEEM TO CENTER BACK TO THESE SAME THREE FEATURES IN SOME WAY OR TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER AND IT CAN BE VERY POWERFUL TO UNDERSTAND AND LOOK AT YOUR EMOTIONS THROUGH THAT LENDS SO LET'S RETURN TO THE INFANT THERE'S THE BABY IN THE CRIB IT'S MOSTLY INTERROCEPTING AS CARE GIVERS BRING IT WHAT IT NEEDS YOU HOPE MILK DIPER CHANGES ET CETERA WARM BLANKET OF ITS COLD PULL OFF THE BLANKET WHEN THE BABIES FUSSING AND ITS TOO WARM CAUSE BABIES GET TO WARM ALSO IT STARTS TO INTERRAS EXTROCEPT EXCUSE ME I MISSPOKE I WON'T BE VERY CLEAR IT STARTS TO EXTEROCEPT THE BABIES STARTS TO LOOK INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND START MAKING PREDICTIONS IT STARTS WONDERING HOW MUCH IT NEEDS TO CRY OR PREDICTING WELL IF I CRY LIKE A LITTLE BIT THEN MOM COMES OVER AND I GET MY MILK OR IF I CRY A LOT MOM DOESN'T COME OVER AND GIVE ME MILK SO I NEED TO REALLY SCREAM AT THE TOP OF MY HEAD O K SO BABIES ARE STARTING TO EVALUATE AND DO ALL THIS BUT THE'RE NOT DOING IT CONSCIOUSLY THEY'RE DOING THIS STRATEGICALLY IN ORDER TO RELIEVE ANXIETY AND I WON'T PROPOSE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DO INTO ADULTHOOD BUT A LOT OF WHAT WE DO IN ADULTHOOD IS WHEN WE FEEL SOMETHING WE START EXTEROCEPTING SOME PEOPLE ARE MUCH BETTER JUST SITTING AS A CONTAINER AND JUST INTERACEPTING AND PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY'RE FEELING INTERNALLY BUT MOST PEOPLE DO A LOWL BIT OF A BALANCE OF BOTH WE STUCWE DON'T FEEL GOOD SO WE LOOK FOR AN ITEM OF FOOD THAT MIGHT MAKE US FEEL BETTER WE'RE FEELING ANXIOUS HEADING INTO THE DENTIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE TEXSOMEBODY WE DO THIS ALMOST REFLECTIVELY IT'S NOT ALWAYS CONSCIOUS SO INFANTS DO THIS AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THIS WE START TOD NOW BALANCE ARE INTERECEPTIVE AND EXTERECEPTIVE FOCUS ARE LOOKING INWARD AND LOOKING OUTWARD AND AS WE DO THAT WE'RE STRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT GETS OUR NEEDS MET REMEMBER EMOTIONS ARE REALLY THERE TO FORM BONDS AND TO MAKE PREDICTIONS AND SO OUR NEEDS ARE GOINGTO BE MET TO SOME DEGREE OR NOT SOMETIMES SADLY THERE IS NEGLECT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T SHOW UP FOR US THE WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE AND IN GENERAL ARE A OURE RESPONSES TO THAT HAVE TO DO WITH WHETHER NOT WE PREDICT WHETHER NOT THEY WOULD OR NOT WHEN WE EXPECT SOMETHING AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IT'S A BIG LET DOWN THAT WAS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT DOPOMINE LAST EPISODE SO THE MANY THEORIES OF EMOTION THE TRIUNE BRAIN THEORY THAT YOU HAVE A PRIMITIVE AND INVOLVED BRAIN SOMETHING THAT'S ELOBIT ON SHAKY GROUND THESE DAYS THE IDEA THAT DARWIN PROPOSE THAT THERE THESE UNIVERSAL EXPRESSIONS OF EMOTIONS THE WORK OF HELEN FISSURE ON LOVE THAT YOU HAVE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN FOR LOST CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN FOR LOVE AND CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN FOR LONG TURN BONDS AS WELL AS THE WORK OF LEISA FELDMAN BEAR IT SAYING THAT EMOTIONS ARE CONTEXTUAL THAT THEY HAVE A SOCIAL COMPONENT AND I'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THIS BUT THE WORK OF ALLAN SHURE A A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND RESEARCH AR OUSEALE ABOUT RIGHT BRAIN LEFT BRAIN AND IT'S ROLL IN EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ALL OF THEM HAVE STRONG ELEMENTS OF THIS IDEA OF PAYING ATTENTION WHT'S GOING ON INWARD AND OUTWARD AS A YOUNG CREATURE AN INFANT AND YOUNG TODDLER YOU WERE MAINLY FOCUSTD INWARD AND YOU START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTWARD AS A WAY OF PREDICTING WHAT WOULD BRING YOU RELIEF WHAT WOULD REMOVE YOUR ANXIETY AND THAT'S WHERE THE FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF YOURE EXPERIENCE YOUR EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE WERE LAID DOWN NIW REALIZE THAT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION AND IT'S SOMEWHAT OF AN ACADEMIC TALK BUT THERE WERE TWO TOOLS IN THERE THAT I JUST ONE A HIGHLIGHT ONE IS THE MOOD METER AP IF YOURE INTERESTED IN IT CAN GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT INTO THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEW ANTS WITH IN EMOTIONS AND ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY PREDICT EMOTIONAL STATES A IF YOU WANT TO TRY THAT TAN YOU MIGHT FIND THAT INTERESTING THE OTHER ONE IS THIS IDEA THAT THERE ARE THREE AXES TO EMOTION THREE CONTINUUM THAT INTERRACT THE LEVEL OF LERTNESS AND COMNESS HOW GOOD OR BAD YOU FEEL AND WHETHER NOT YOUR MAINLY FOCUSS INWARD OR OUTWARD BECAUSE THOSE ARE GOING TO FORM A USEFUL TOOL KIT FOR THE INFORMATION GOING FORWARD SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF BABY YOU WERE BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY IN FORMS YOUR EMOTIONALITY NOW THESE ARE CLASSIC THERE ACTUALLY FAMOUS EXPERIMENTS DONE BY BOLBYAN AINSWORTH ANY ONE THAT STUDIED PSYCHOLOGIERS TAKEN A PSYCHOLOGY CLASS MIHTHAVE LEARNED ABOUT THIS THIS IS THIS CLASSIC EXPERIMENT OF THE WHAT WAS CALLED THE STRANGE SITUATION TASK IN WHICH AND I'M DESCRIBING IT VERY COARSELY HERE I REALIZE BUT A MOTHER AND CHILD COME INTO THE LABORATORY YES THIS AS NOW ALSO BEEN DONE WITH FATHERS THE BABY AND THE MOTHER OR FATHER PLAY TOGETHER FOR A BIT AND THEN THE MOTHER LEAVES THE MOTHER LEAVES FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN COMES BACK AND THE RESEARCH IS DEVOTED TO UNDERSTANDING THE RESPONSE OF THE CHILD WHEN THE CARETAKER THE MOTHER OF THE FATHER RETURNS MOST ALL CHILDREN NOT EVERY CHILD BUT MOST CHILDREN WILL CRY WHEN THEIR PRIMARY CARETAKER LEAVES THEY DON'T LIKE THAT AND THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR THAT THEY FORMED A BOND IN AN ATTACHMENT AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOME F THE DEEPER CHEMICAL REASONS FOR THOSE BONDS HOWEVER THE EXPERIMENT IS FOCUSSED ON THE RETURN OF THE CAREGIVER BECAUSE BOLBY AND AINSWORTH AND MANY OF THEIR SCIENTIFIC OFFSPRING AND COLLEAGUES IDENTIFIED AT LEAST FOUR PATTERNS THAT BABIES DISPLAY WHEN THEIR CARETAKER RETURNS AND THEY GROUP THESE INTO GROUP A B C D SO MUCH SO THAT THE KIDS WERE REFERRED TO AS A BABIES B BABIES C BABIES OR DEE BABIES YOU MAY KNOW WHICH ONE YOU WERE BUT THE CATGORIES ARE REALLY INTERESTING THE FIRST BABIES ARE THE ABABIES SO THESE WERE KIDS THAT WOULD GET UPSET WHEN THEIR CARETAKER WOULD LEAVE BUT WHEN THEIR CARETAKER WOULD RETURN THE INFANT WOULD RESPOND WITH HAPPINESS WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE DELIGHT THEY WOULD GO TO THE CARETAKER THEY SEEMED HAPPY IF THEY HAD BEEN FUSSY BEFORE OR SAD THEY FELT RELIEVED THESE ARE REFERRED TO AS SECURE ATTACHED KIDS SO THEY HAVE A HEALTHY RESPONSE TO SEPARATION AND THEY HAVE THA HEALTHY RESPONSE TO RE ENGAGING WITH THE CARETAKER THE B BABIES AS THEY'RE CALLED WERE LESS LIKELY TO SEEK COMFORT FROM THEIR CAREGIVER WHEN THE CAREGIVER WOULD RETURN SO THEY WOULD SOMETIMES CONTINUED TO PLAY WITH THEIR TOYS OR THEY WOULD A BE WITH THE THEY HAD AN ADULT IN THE ROOM WHILE THE PARENT WAS GONE THEY WOULD STAY WITH THEM IT WAS SOMETIMES COMPLICATED AND NUANTS BUT THESE WERE REFERRED TO AS AVOIDANT BABIES DON'T RUN AWAY WITH ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE HERE JUST YET IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT AVOIDING BABIES BECOME AVOID INT ADULTS BUT BEARE WITH ME THE S BABIES WOULD RESPOND TO THE RETURN OF THE CAREGIVER WITH ACTS OF ANNOYANCE THEY SEEM KIND OF ANGRY RY SO WASN'T THAT THEY IGNORED THEM THEY SEEM KIND OF ANGRY AND THOSE WERE REFERRED TO AS AMBIVLENT BABIES  NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH ABABIES THESE ARE THE S BABIS WERE THE AMBIVOLENT BABIES SO THE INFANTS REACTION TO THE RETURNING CAREGIVER WERE INCONSISTENT THEY IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WANTED TO BOND WITH THEM AGAIN BUT THAT THEY SEEM KIND OF ANNOYED I THINK WE'VE ALL FELT THIS WAY BEFOR WITH PEOPLE THAT WE CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WE ARE VERY MUCH ABOUT AND THEN THE THIRD CATEGORY THE D BABIES WERE THE DISORGANIZED BABIES THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THEM THEY WEREN'T DISORGANIZING THAT THEY WERE MESSY THE CHILD AVOIDED INTERACTIONS WITH EVERY ONE AND ACTED FEARFUL WHEN THE CAREGIVER RETURND AND THEIR BEHAVOR DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE WHETHER NOT THE CAREGIVER WAS THERE OR NOT ND THAT FOURTH CATEGORY WAS ACTUALLY ADDED RATHER LATE IN THE COURSE OF THIS RESEARCH I SHOULD MENTION THES EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN REPEATED WITH A HUGE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CONTECTS THEYE WAS WORK DONE BY MARY MAIN AT A AT YOU SEE BERKLEY AND MANY OTHERS LOOKING AT ALL SORTS OF VARIATIONS ON THIS THEME BUT OVER TIME IT MADE IT CLEAR THAT CERTAIN BABIES ARE ABLE TO FEEL SECURE UPON REENGAGING WITH THEIR CARE GIVER AND OTHERS DON'T OR THEIR CONFUSED ABOUT IT SO WE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER NOT YOU ARE IN A  R C D BABY UNLESS YOU ARE IN THESE EXPERIMENTS AND SOMEHOW YOU HAD THAT KNOWLEDGE BUT THIS WORK THIS CLASSIC WORK OPENED UP A HUGE SET OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT RELATE TO WHAT IS THE RE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BOND REALLY ABOUT I MEAN WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEING FIGURED OUT HERE IS NOT WHETHER NOT THEIR FOUR CATEGORIES OF BABIES THAT'S INTERESTING BUT IT PRESUMABLY IS MORE INTERESTING TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS IT THAT DEFINES A REALLY GOOD BOND A SECURE ATTACHMENT OR AN INSECURE ATTACHMENT R AN AVOIDAN ATTACHMENT AND THE FOUR THINGS ARE GAZE LITERALLY I CONTACT AND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DIRECT BEAMING EYE CONTACT WITH NO BLINKS LIKE PEOPLE ACCUSE ME OF BEFORE CAN JUST BE GAZE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE LOOK AT EACH OTHER U SEE COUPLES THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER THEY DON'T ALWAYS TARE EACH OTHER LONG PERIODS OF TIMES SOMETIMES THEY DO VOKE VOCALIZATIONS SO WHAT WE SAY AND HOW WE SAY IT AFFECT OR EMOTIONS SO THE WAY THAT WE EXPRESS IN YO CRYING SMILING ET CETERA AND TOUCH THOSE FOUR THINGS AND YOU PROBABLY COULD ADD A FIFTH DIMENSION ONCE LANGUAGE AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE DEVELOPS WHICH IS WRITTEN WORD EXCHANGE OF LETTERS EXCHANGE OF TAXTS EXCHANGE OF THINGS OF THAT SORT EMALES ARE ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN BOND BUT GAZE VOCALIZATION AFFECT AND TOUCH ARE REALLY THE CORE OF THIS THING THAT WE CALL SOCIAL BONDS AND EMOTIONALITY NOW THAT'S IMPORTANT WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT THERE ARE BRAIN AREAS LIKE THE FUSIFORM FACE AREA WHICH IS DEEP IN THE BRAIN THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROCESSING OF FACES CHILDREN RECOGNITION OF THEIR PARENTS FACES AND VOICES IS EXTREMELY ACCURATE AND STRONG LIKEWISE PARENTS RECOGNITION OF THEIR CHILD'S VOCALIZATIONS NOT JUST VOICES BUT CRIES ARE REMARKABLE I IF YOU'VE EVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN A PARTY WITH SOMEBODY WHO HASE SMALL CHILDREN YOUR TALKING THEM AN ALL SUN THEY THEY HEAR SOMETHING BUT YOU DON'T IT'S AS IF THEY'VE GOT WOLF HEARING AND ALLT SEND THEY GO RUNNING INTO THE OTHER ROOM AN INDEED THE YOU KNOW THE KID IS LIKE I DON'T NOW SOME KID IS BEATING UP THEIR KID OR THEIR KIDS BEATING UP SOME OTHER KID OR THE KID IS DONCE INJURED THEMSELVES OR FEELS EMOTIONALLY INJURED THIS PERCEPTION OF VOICES  THERE'S VERY GOD EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT WE ARE TUNED TO THE FREQUENCIES OF OF VOICES AND VOCALIZATIONS OF PEOPLE THAT WE CARE ABOUT AT'S NOT JUST TRUE IN RODINTS AND IN BIRDS AND OTHER MAMMELS IT'S DEAFLY TRUE IN HUMANS AS WELL AND BABIES ARE VERY TUNED IN TO THE SOUND OF THEIR OF THEIR MOTHER'S VOICE EVEN YES WHILE THER IN THE WOMB OM THERE'S THIS WHOLE A WORLD OF WHAT'S CALLED MOTHER EASE WHICH IS THA THE PARTICULAR OM STYLE OF SPEECH THAT MOTHERS AND OTHER CARETAKERS NOW WE KNOW ARE USE WITH CHILDREN SO THOSE ARE THE CORE ELEMENTS RIGHT HOW YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY AND HOW THEY LOOK AT YOU WHAT YOU SAY WHAT THEY SAY WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE FEELING AND HOW THAT MAKES YOU FEEL SMILES FROWNS IF YOU KNOW SOME ONEREALLY WELL YOU CAN READ INFLECTIONS IND LIKE EVEN LITTLE SUBTLE THINGS LIKEYOU KNOW THEY ONT THEY DON REALLY BELIE ME OR O THEY AH THEYRE REALLY EXCITED BY THIS OR AM OH YOU KNOW NOW I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING THAT KIND OF PROCESSING SOME PEOPLE ARE ARE BETTER ATT IT THAN OTHERS BUT EVERYONE'S BETTER AT DOING THAT WITH PEOPLE THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND KNOW IN FACT COUPLES COME TO KNOW EACH OTHEIRE EXCEEDINGLY WELL SO MUCH SO THAT O IT CAN BOTH BENEFIT AND INJURE THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO CONSTANTLY BE MAKING THESE PERCEPTIONS BUT THERE'S ARRANGE SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE TUNE INTO THIS THAN OTHERS AND THAT PROBABLY HAS ROOTS IN THE SORTS OF ATTACHMENTS THAT YOU FORM ERLY ON SO BULBY IN COLLEAGUES DEVELOP THESE A B C D THING AND HAS A LOT TO DO WITH FACE PROCESSING AND GAZE ENVOCALIZATIONS AND TOUCH ALL OF THOSE HAPPENED ON RETURN WITH THE MOTHER BUT THEY WEREN'T PARCING THOSE THEY WEREN'T LOOKINGAT THEM INDIVIDUALLY SO THIS RAISEIS A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT IS IT WHEN WE FEEL SOMETHING IS IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS SPONTANEOUSLY IN UCIT SOME MEMORY OR IT SOMETHING THT WE REALIZE WE SAW ON THE INNER NET ORE WE GOT NEWS ABOUT SOMEBODY I YOU KNOW NOWADAYS PEOPLE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THE PEOPLE THEY KNOW BOTH THE PEOPLE THEY LIKE IN DISLIKE BY WAY OF VIEWING ON LINE ACTIVITIES RIGHT SO THEI'RE EXTRECEPTING AND THEN IT'S IMPACTING YOUR INTERNAL STATE AND IT'S CLEAR FROM MOST ALL OF THE THEORIES OF EMOTIONAL HEALTH THAT IN ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE WHEN YOUR OWN INTERNAL STATE IS BEING DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY EXTERNAL EVENTS AS IMPORTANT FOR BEING ABLE TO EMOTIONALLY REGULY MY PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSTANTLY BEING YANKED AROUND BY THE EXTERNAL HAPPENINGS IN THE WORLD YOU WOULD SAY ARE EMOTIONALLY LA BILE THEY ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF THEIR EMOTIONS EVEN IF THEI'RE CALM ALL THE TIME IF THAT CALMNESS ONLY ARIVES BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A PLACID ENVIRONMENT AND THEN YOU PUT YOU KNOW A CRACKER IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AND THEY FREAK OUT WELL THEN THEY'RE NOT REALLY CALM THEY ARE THEIR CALM IN SO FAR AS THERE ISN'N SOMETHING DISTURBING IN THE ENVIRONMENT SO HOW MUCH YOUR THE OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENT DESRUPTS YOUR INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS BALANCE OF INTERECEPTION AND EXTERECEPTION AND IT VERY LIKELY HAS ROOTS AN WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE SECURE ATTACHED OR INSECURE ATTACHED DISORGANIZED OR IMBIVILENT AS A BABY OF COURSE YOU CAN'T TRAVEL BACK IN TIME AND KNOW BUT THERE ARE SOME HINTS AS TO WHAT KIND OF EMOTIONALITY EACH OF US HAS BY EXAMINING TWO PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT ONE IS ADOLESCENCE IN PUBRITY AND THE OTHER IS ADULTHOOD SO WHILE WE CAN'T TRAVEL BACK IN TIME THERE IS AN EXERCISE THAT YOU CAN DO TO ADDRESS AT LEAST IN THIS MOMENT WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A BIAS FOR EXTRECEPTION OR ABIAS FOR INTERRECEPTION WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE BETTER AT LEAST IN THIS MOMENT AT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY AND OF COURSE THIS WILL VARY S CIRCUMSTANCE ITHINK WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE THAT MAYBE IT'S YOU YOU GO TO A PARTY AND YOU GET THERE AND EVERY ONE SEEMS TO BE TALKING AND HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME AND YOU'RE WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE ANY FOOD IN YOUR TEETH OR WHETHE ANOTHER SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE OR WHETHER NOT YOUR HAIR IS RIGHT OR WHETHER NOT YOU SAID SOMETHING THE WRONG WAY WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE TURNING RED PEOPLE ALSO EXPERIENCE THIS A LOT WITH PUBLIC SPEAKING AN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LEARNING TO CLAMP YOUR LEVEL OF STRESS IT'S ALSO ABOUT HOW MUCH YOUR EXTRACEPTING HOW MUCH YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR HEAD THEY CALL IT BUT HOW MUCH YOUR FOCASSED ON THE EVENTS AROUND YOU VERSES THE EVENTS INSIDE YOU ASHLE IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY EFFECTIVE ATHLETES WHERE THEY A VERY HIGH STRESS HIGH CONSEQUENCE JOBS THEY TALK ABOUT THIS NOTION OF YOU GETTING OUT OF YOUR HEAD YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH ATTENTIONAL RESOURCE AND IT CAN BE SPLIT BETWEEN TWO THINGS YOU'LL SEE THAT IN A MOMENT HIY CAN BE ANCHORED TO ONE THING IND CAN BE FULLY FOCUSSED ON WHAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY OR CAN BE FULLY FOCAS ON WANT'S GOING ON EXTERNALLY AND IF YOU WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE WORLD EFFECTIVE BEING IN QUOTES IT IS USEFUL WHEN IN VERY DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS ESPECIALLY SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS TO HAVE A LOT OF YOUR ATTENTION FOCUSSE OUTWARD I SUPPOSE TO TRYING TOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHETHER NOT YOUR SAYING THINGS CORRECTLY OR THE TAMBER OF YOUR OWN VOICE THAT IS MORE OR LESS DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE SOCIALLY SO HERE'S THE EXERCISE YOU CAN DO THIS PLEASE DON'T DO THIS OF YOUR DRIVING AH BUT LET'S JUST TRY IN ILLUSTRATE OR ALLOW YOU TO EXPERIENCE THIS INTEROCEPTIV EXTRA ECEPTIVE BALANCE AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU CAN MOVE INTERCEPTION AND EXTRAECEPTION DELIBERATELY IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES RIGHT NOW AND CONCENTRATE ON THE CONTACT OF ANY PORTION OF YOUR BODY WILD SAY THE CHAIR OR YOUR CARSEET ALTHOUGH PLEASE AGAIN DON'T DO THIS WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING AH ANYWHERE THAT YOU ARE EVEN IF YOU'D RSTANDING UP OR YOU'RE IN THE KITCHEN RELYING ON THE COUCH AND TRYING TO BRING AS MUCH OF YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT POINT OF CONTACT AS POSSIBLE AND THEN FROM THERE YOU GAN O MOVE YOUR ATTENTION EVEN MORE DEEPLY INTO SAY THE SENSATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR GOT ARE YOU FULL OR YOU EMPTY OR YOU HUNGRY OR YOU NOT A IS YOUR HEART BEATING AT WHAT RATE WHAT'S THE CADENTS OF YOUR BREATHING BASELY BRINGING YOUR FOCUS AN ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING AT THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN AND INWARD SO IE GOING TO DO A RARE THING ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODGASS OMMN INTRODUCE ABOUT FIVE DAT SECONDS OF SILENCE I'M IN ORDER TO ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT A LITTLE BIT OKE NOW THIS IS AN EXERCISE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE AFTERWARD IF YOU WAN TO EXTEND HOW LONG YOU DO THIS BUT NOW TRY AND DO SOMETHING THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE ACTHS A LITTL BIT HARDER WHICH IS TO PURELY E EXTEROCEPT PUT PUT YOUR EYES OR YOUR EARS OR BOTH ON ANYTHING IN YOUR IMMEDIATE SPACE ONE THING AND I WOULD RESTRICT THAT THING TO SOMETHING SMALL ENOUGH A THAT AT LEAST IN YOUR FIELD OF YIOU IT WOULD OCCUPY YOU KNOW TWENTY PER CENT OF YOUR FIELD OF EW SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A PIN POINT UNLESS THE PIN IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU IN YOUR HOLDING IT REL CLOSE I WOULD SAY LOOK ACROSS THE ROOM PICK UP PANEL ON THE WALL OR A YOU KNOW A LEG OF A TABLE OR SOMETHING AND TRY AND BRING AS MUCH OF YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT AS POSSIBLE AND AGAIN A TAKE ABOUT FIVE SECONDS OF SILENCE TO ALLOW YOU TO EXTEROCEPT OCS WHAT YOU PROBABLY FOUND IS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT THAT SOME DEGREE OF INTERECEPTION IS MAINTAINED IT'S HARD TO PLACE A HUNDR PERCENT OF YOUR ATTENTION ON SOMETHING EXTERNALLY UNLESS IT'S REALLY EXCITING REALLY NOVEL YOU'VE EVER WATCH A RALLY GREAT MOVIE PRESUMELY YOUR EXTRAOCEPTING MORE THAN YOUR INTERECEPTING UNTIL SOMETHING EXCITING HAPPENS THAN AND THEN YOU FEEL SOMETHING YOUR ACTIALLY TETHERING YOUR EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE TO SOMETHING EXTERNAL AND NOW YOU CAN ALSO DO THIS DYNAMICALLY YOU CAN DECIDE TO FOCUS INTERNALLY AN THE  EXTERNALLY YOU CAN DECIDE TO SPLIT IT FIFTY PER CENT FIFTY PERCENT OR SEVENTY THIRTY ONE CAN DEVELOP YOU CAN DEVELOP A HEIGHTENED ABILITY TO DO THIS AND THE POWER OF DOING THAT IS ACTUALLY THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR FOCUS TOO MUCH INTERNALLY AND YOU LIKE TO BE FOCUS MORE EXTERNALLY YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT DELIBERATELY BUT AS YOU NOTICE IT TAKES WORK IT INVOLVES TAKING YOUR ATTENTIONAL SPOTLIGHT AND WHAT WE CALL THE APERTURE OF YOUR ATTENTION AND NARROWING THAT APERTURE TO EITHER THE SELF OR SOMETHING EXTERNALLY OR SPLITTING THE TWO AND YET THERE ARE PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT CENTRE ON MOVING INTERECEPTION AND EXTO RECEPTION FROM ONE BEING MORE HEAVILY WEIGHTED THAN THE OTHER MORE FOCUSED OUTWARD OR MORE FOCUSSED INWARD AND IT'S DYNAMIC AND THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT UNDER LIE INTERRO AN EXTO RECEPTION AREN'T EXACTLY KNOWN BUT THEY ARE ANCHORED IN THE AREAS THE BRAIN THEIR VOLT AND ATTENTION LIKE THE FRONT LI FEELDS AN AREAS THAT ON WHEN YOU THIRD PERSON YOURSELF WHEN YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF DOING SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND OUT IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND YOU FOCUSS ON YOUR HAND YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S YOUR HAND AS SPPOSED TO SOMM RANDOM OBJECT THERE ARIIS THE BRAIN THEIR INVOLVED IN THAT IN RECOGNIZING LOCATION OF SELF RELATIVE TO THE REST YOUR BODY THESE EXERCISES ARE REALLY WHAT ARE AT THE CORE OF THESE DEVELOPMENT OF EMOTIONAL BONDS BECAUSE AS WE MENTION BEFORE THESE FOUR THINGS THE GAZE VOCALIZATION TOUCH AN AFFECT THOSE ARE HAPPENING VERY DYNAMICALLY SO IF SOMEBODY WINKS AT YOU YOUR PAYING ATTENTION TO THEIR WINK BUT THEN YOUR ALSO NOTICE HOW OU FEEL THEN THEY MIGHT SAY SOMETHING THAN YOU MIGHT SAY IN TIT IS VERY DYNAMIC SO IF IT SEEMS OVERWHELMING TO TRY AND INTERACEPTAN ETERAOCEPTAND THAN SHIFT THE BOLANCE YOU DO THAT ALL THE TIME YOUR BRAIN IND EVRSYSTEM ARE FANTASTIC AT DOING THIS NOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE A VERY HARD TIME BREAKING OUT OF A VERY STRONGLY ENTEROCEPTIVE MODE SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HARDER TIME BREAKING OUT OF THEIR EXTEROCEPTIVE MODE IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO NOTE THE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE HAVE BIACES AND HOW INTERACEPTIVE OR EXTEROCEPTIVE WE ARE REMEMBER THOSE THREE AXES THAT WE TALKT ABOUT EARLIER YOU HAVE VAILANCE GOOD OR BAD YOU HAVE ALERTNESS ALERT OR CALM AND YOU HAVE INTERACEPTIVE OR EXTEROCEPTIVE BY US Y AND IT'S GOING TO DIFFER ACROSS THE DAY IT'S GOING TO DIFFER ACROSS THE LIFETIME ANTS CERTAINLY GOING TO DIFFER ACCORDING TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE ENGAGED IN BUT EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT YOU START OFF WITH THIS INTEROCEPTIVE BYUS YOU ARE STARTING TO DEVELOP EXPECTATIONS PREDICTIONS ABOUT HOW THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS GOING TO WORK AND YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE RELIABILITY OF OUTSIDE EVENTS AND PEOPLE AND WERE THINGS ARE RELIABLE WHEN PEOPLE ARE RELIABLE WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE UP MORE OF OUR INTERACEPTION THERE'S LITERALLY TRUST THAT OUR INTERACEPTIVE NEEDS OUR INTERNAL NEEDS WILL BE MET THROUGH BONDS AN ACTIONS OF OTHERS THIS STARTS TO VERE TOWARD THE DISCUSSION ABOUT NEGLECT INTRAMA WE ARE GOING TO DEVOTE ENTIRE EPISODES PROBLY AN ENTIRE MONTH TO TRAMA AND PITIISTY BUT THESE THOSE HAVE ROOTS IN WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO INTERNALIZE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THOSE FUTURE CONVERSATIONS SO IF ALL THIS SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND VERY COMPLICATED I JUST INVITE YOU TO PAY ATTENTION FROM TIME TO TIME HOW MUCH YOU HAPTEN TO BE ENTERACEPTING OR EXTEROCEPTING BECAUSE EMOTIONS AND THE INTENSITY OF THOSE EMOTIONS WE'LL GROW OR SHRINK DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH WE'RE ENTEROCEPTING IF WE ARE FEELING EXTREMELY SAD AND THERE IS AN OUTSIDE EVENT THAT MADE US SAD CHANCES ARE THEREIS GOING TO BE ABALANCED BUT THAT THE EXTREME GRIEF THE EXTREME SADNESS IS GOING TO LEAD US TO MOSTLY INTEROCEPT WHEREAS WHEN WHEN WE'RE FEELING EXTREMELY HAPPY THE SAME IS TRUE YOU KNOW SOMETHING GREAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD AND WERE JUST GOING TO FEEL IT MOST OF OUR PERCEPTION MOST OF OUR AWARENES SIS GOING TO BE ON INTERNAL STATE SO WE ARE ALWAYS TETHERED TO THE OUTCSIDE WORLD TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER IT'S THAT WAS TRUE WHEN YOU WARE AN INFANT AND IT WAS TRUE WHEN YOU ARE NADOLESCENT AND IT'S TRUE AS AN ADULT SO NOW I WANTED JUST PAUS JUST SHELVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT INTERAOCEPTION EXTEROCEPTION FOR MOMENT AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS ARGUBLY THE SECOND MOST IF NOT EQUALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF YOUR DEVELOPMENT AS IT RELATES TO EMOTIONALITY AND AS IT RELATES TO THIS WHAT I CALL TRUST BUT THIS ABILITY TO PREDICT WHETHER NOT THINGS IN THE OUTPSIDE WORLD ARE RELIABLE OR NOT REL RELIABLE IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO HELP YOU MEET YOUR INTEROCEPTIVE NEEDS AND THAT PERIOD IS PUBERTY SO UP UNTIL NOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING MAINLY ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY NOT A LOT OF BIOLOGY NOT A LOT OF MECHANISM AND NAWORGAN TRANSITION INTO TALKING ABOUT MECHANISM HORMONES RECEPTORS ET CETERA PUBERTY IS A ABSOLUTE BIOLOGICAL EVENT IT HAS A BEGINNING AND IT HAS A SPECIFIC DEFINITION WHICH IS THE TRANSITION IN TO REPRODUCTIVE MATURITY SO THERE A LOT OF HORMONAL CHANGES YES THERE ALSO LOT OF BRAIN CHANGES AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IT BUT THE BRAIN CHANGES OCCUR FIRST THE BRAIN TURNS ON THE HORMONE SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW PUBERTY TO OCCUR PUBERTY IS OCCURRING EARLIER NOWADAYS THAN IT DID IN THE PAST THE CURRENT NUMBERS THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND IS THAT IN FEMALES GIRLS I THE TRANSITION IS STARTING AROUND AGE TEN WHEREAS INBOYS IT'S ABOUT AGE TWELVE THAT'S GOING TO DIFFER BY WAY OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THOSE ARE AVERAGES SO DEPEND AL WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD DEPENDS ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS ONE OF THE PRIMARY TRIGGERS FOR PUBERTY IS ACTUALLY BODY FAT THIS IS INTERESTING THE PEPTIE HORMONE LEPTIN SOME PEOPLE CALL THE PEPTITE SOME PEOPLE CALL TO HORMONE BUT IT MEETS BOTH DEFINITIONS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT IS MADE BY FAT SO LEPTIN HAD A LOT OF POPULARITY IN THE NINETIES BECAUSE IT WAS DISCOVERED AS BEING PRODUCED BY FAT AND IT WAS SEEN IN ANIMAL STUDIES THAT IT COULD PROMOTE LEANNESS IT ACTUALLY COMMUNICATES TO THE BRAIN THAT THERE'S ENOUGH BODY FAT IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE METABOLIC FACTORS AND PROCESSES TO OCCUR TO LIBERATE MORE FAT THIS IS WHY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE LOSING THAT LAST FIVE POUNDS IT'S BECAUSE LEAPT IN LEVELS ARE VERY LOW THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE BASIS FOR THE WHOLE CHEAT DAY REFEED THING THAT THE IDEA WAS IF YOU A EAT A LOT FOR ONE DAY A WEEK WHILE DIETING HARD THAT YOU CAN SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN THAT THERE'S ENOUGH LEPT IN I DON'T KNOW IF THATS THE REASON OR WHETHER NOT THE CHEAT DAYS JUST PROVIDED SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL RELIEF PROBABLY BOTH BUT IN ANY CASE LEPTON IS MADE BY BODY FAT AND WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH LEAPT IN IT SIGNALS THE BRAIN TO TRIGGER PUBERTY THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE MIDNINETIES IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOWING THAT LEPTON COULD BE INJECTED INTO YOUNGER FEMALES THAT WOULD NOT HAVE YET GONE INTO PUBERTY AND YOU COULD ACCELERATE THE ONSET OF PUBERTY WITH LEPTON SO THE MORE BODY FAT THE EARLIER PUBERTY THAT'S TRUE LEPTON IS ALSO INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GROWTH EFFECTS IN THE BODY GENERALLY AND ITS INTERESTING A VERIOBEEST CHILDREN DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERGO PUBERTY EARLIER  SOMETIMES THEY DO BUT THEY DO TEND TO BE LARGER BONED IT THEIR BONES AT SHOULD GROW MORE QUICKLY AND THEY TEND HAVE HIGER BONDENSITY BECAUSE LEPTON IS ALSO INVOLVED IN BONEDENSITY THE WHOLE ISSUE OF ONSET OF PUBERTY ALSO HAS SOME REALLY INTERESTING SOCIAL EFFECTS AND I ONE OF REALLY HIGH LIGHT THAT MOST OF THESE EFFECTS ARE SO CALLED FARIMON EFFECTS REMEMBER HORMON IS A SUBSTANCE SECRETED FROM ONE AREA THE BODY TRAVELS AND IMPACTS TISSUES AND SELVES ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY A FARMON IS A CHEMICAL THAT'S RELEASED BY ONE MEMBER OF A SPECIES THAT GO AS AN ACTS ON AND IMPACTS OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT SPECIES OR EVEN OTHER SPECIES SO FOR INSTANCE RODENTS ARE VERY GOOD AT DETECTING THE THE URINE AND THE SENT MARKINGS OF LARGE CARNIVORES THAT WANT TO EAT THEM SO THAT'S A FARMONAL INTERACTION WHETHER OR NOT THEIR FARMONAL EFFECTS IN HUMANS IS VERY DEBATED I DID APPOST ON THIS ON INSRAMELO WHILE AGO ABOUT SOME FARMON EFFECTS THAT WEREPORTED IN HUMANS AND I HAD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE COMMAT ME SAYING LOOK ITS NEVER REALLY BEEN SHOWN IN HUMANS THAT THERE IS A FARMONAL VOMER WHAT'S CALLED THE VOMORONAZAL ORGAN THERE SOMETHNG CALED JACOBSON'S ORGAN ITS RUDIMENTRY SOME PEOPLE HAVE IT SOME PEOPLE DON'T VERY CONTROVERSIAL SO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HUMAN FARMON EFFECTS ARE CONTROVERSIAL ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE'S IN MY OPINION THERE'S AMPLE EVIDENCE FOR THEM SYNCERNIZATION OF MENSTRUAL CYCLES FOR MANY PEOPLE REPORT TEN PEOPLE SAY THERE SOME STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IT'S NOT TRUE THEN THERE BEEN SOME DATAS SHOWING VERY IMPRESSIVE FARMONAL EFFECTS OF FEMALE PARTNERS BEING ABLE TO DETECT THE ODOR OF THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS ON TEA SHIRTS THAT WERE WASHED SEVERAL TIMES TO THEY CAN'T CONSCIOUSLY PERCEIVE IT BUT THEY SAY THIS ONE SMELLS LIKE THEM THIS ONE SMELLS LIKE MY PARTNER AND INDEED ON THE THE MATCHUAS WAY ABOVE CHANCE SO THERE DOES SEEM TO BE WEAK FARMONAL EFFECTS AT LEAST IN MY OPINION WHEN I LOOK AT THE DATA BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE SO ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING FARMON EFFECTS THAT IMPACTS PUBERTY AT LEAST IN ANIMAL MODELS IS THE SO CALLED VANDENBERG EFFECT WHICH IS IF YOU TAKE A PRE PUBERIDAL FEMALE SO A FEMALE THAT HAS NOT UNDERGONE SEXUAL MATURATION AND YOU INTRODUCE A NOVEL MALE THAT IS NOT THE FATHER OR A BROTHER NOT A SIBLING SHE WILL UNDERGO PUBERTY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SO THIS IS REALLY STRIKING FOR YEARS THIS WAS THOUGHT NOT TO OCCUR IN PRIMATE SPECIES BUT THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IN CURMIOLOGY SELPRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOWING THAT MANDREL O PARTICULAR TYPE OF PRIMATE THEY EXHIBIT THIS VANIMBERG EFFECT THERE ARE ALSO ALL SORTS OF OTHER FARMON EFFECTS THERE'S THE ON THE MOST INFAMOUS ONE IS CALLED THE BRUCE EFFECT WHERE THE INTRODUCTION OF A NOVEL MALE TO A PREGNANT FEMALE ANIMAL CAUSE IS SPONTANEOUS MISCARRIAGE AND THAT EFFECT SEEMS TO BE PROTE CTED AGAINST BY THE PRESENCE OF THE FATHER SO ANOTHER YUKNOW THAT THES A INTERPRETATION OF THIS AND I ON REALLY HIGLIGHT THAT THIS IS THESE ARE ANIMAL STUDIES BUT THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THAT IF A PREGNANT FEMALE IS IN THE COMPANY OF THE MALE THAT IMPREGNATED HER THEND HER YOUNG ARE PROTECTED BY HIS SCENT PRESENCE OR HIS FARMON PRESENCE BUT IF HE'S GONE AN A NOVEL MALE SHOWS UP THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR HER TO SPONTANEOUSLY MISCARRY AND ESSENTIALLY FOR A THE FEAT IS TO BE LOST NOW WHETHER NOT THIS OCCURS IN HUMANS IS STILL VERY CONTROVERSIAL BUT NONE THE LESS THESE FERMON EFFECTS EXIST AND THAT ONE IS CALLED THE BRUCE EFFECT NAMED AFTER HILDABRUCE WHO IS THE SCIENTISTS THAT DISCOVERED IT THE ONE THAT'S RELEVANT TO THE PUBERTY DISCUSSION IS THE VANON BIRD EFFECT WHICH I MENTION A FEW MINUTES AGO WHICH IS A NOVEL MALE SHOWING UP SEC HAS TO BE SEXUALLY COMPETENT MALE SO HE HAS TO HAVE ALREADY PASSD THROUGH PUBERTY AND HIS PRESENTE TRIGGER'S ACTIVATION OF PUBERTY IN A FEMALE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE REMAINED PREPUBERDAL FOR LONGER AGAIN WHETHER NOT THIS HAPPENS IN HUMANS ON CLEAR WELL WHAT CAN WE BE SURE ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PUERTY PUBERTY IS TRIGGERED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THEIRE CHANGES IN GABA EXPRESSION IN THE BRAIN AND INHIBITORY TRANSMITTER ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING MOLECULES THAT TRIGGER'S PUBERTY IN ALL INDIVIDUALS IS SOMETHING CALLED KISPEPTON K I S S P  P P I N KISPEPTON KISPEPTON IS MADE BY THE BRAIN AND IT STIMULATES LARGE AMOUNTS OF AL DIFFERENT HORMON CALLED G N RH CANATATROPEAN RELEASING HORMON TO BE RELEASED GANATROPAN RELEASING HORMON THEN CAUSES THE RELEASE OF ANOTHER HORMON CONES SOMETHING LIKE CALLED LUTINIZING HORMONER EL H WHICH TRAVELS IN THE BLOOD STREAM AND STIMULATES THE OVERIES OF FEMALES TO PRODUCE ESTROGEN AND THE TESTIES OF MALES TO PRODUCE TESTOSTERON KISPEPTON HAS OTHER EFFECTS AS WELL BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MAIN ONES AS THEY RELATE TO PUBERTY THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE AT THIS POINT THE TESTIS IN MALES START TURNING OUT TONS OF TESTASTRON IN ORDER TO TRIGGER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS BODY HAIR AND ALL THE OTHERS DEEPENING A VOICE ET CETERA AND IN FEMALES ESTROGEN IS DOING VARIOUS OTHER THINGS BREST DEVELOPMENT ET CETERA NORMALLY IN AN ADULT SOMEBODY WHO IS PASSED PUBERTY A BIG INCREASE IN GANATROPAN RELEASING HORMON AND LUTINIZING HORMON WOULD EVENTUALLY BE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN WORKS THE HYPOPHALMUS IN THE PETUITARY ARE ACTUALLY MEASURING HOW MUCH HORMON IS IN THE BLOOD AND IF TESTOSTRON OR ESTROGEN OR ANY OTHER HORMO N GOES TOO HIGH THEY SHUT DOWN THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE LUTINIZING HORMON IT'S A WAY CALL THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACKLOUP IT BASILYS LIKE A THERMASTAT IN A HOUSE IT'S MORE COMPLICATE THAN THAT BUT ONCE LEVELS GET TOO HIGH IN THE BLEDSTRUMIT SHUTS DOWN BUT KISSPEPTON IS ABLE TO DRIV VERY HIGH LEVELS OF THESE HORMONES IN AN ON GOING WAY SO THAT PUBERTY CAN COMMENCE AND CON CONTINUE AND INCIDENTALLY KISSPEPTON HAS NOW BECOME A YET ANOTHER OF THE PANOPLY OF AM HORMONES AND PEPTIDES AND COCKTAILS THAT A ATHLETES TAKE IN ORDER TO TRYING STIMULATE NATURAL HORMON PRODUCTION ESSENTIALLY TO CREATE THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS A INDOGENOUSLY NO JUDGMENT THERE BUT THAT'S A FACT THERE'S A LOT OF KISPEPTON USE PEOPLE I'M NOT I TRULY NOT SUGGESTING ANYONE DO THIS BUT A PEOPLE ARE BUYING IN INJECTING KISPEPTON FOR THE SPECIFIC REASON THAT EVEN PASSPUBERTY CAN STIMULATE THE LARGE INCREASES IN THINGS LIKE ESTEROGEN LARGE INCREASES IN TESTOSTRONE AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AS A NUMBER OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS TO SEEMS TO HAVE BIG EFFECTS ON LOBIDO ET CETERA ALL THESE THINGS OF COURSE O SUBJECT TO FEED BACK LOOPS M SO THEY DON'T WORK IN DEFINITELY AND ON HIGHLIHT AGAIN I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYONE DO IT BUT I DO LIKE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S OUT THERE AND KISSPEPTIN BECAUSE IT WASN'T DISCOVERED THAT LONG AGO IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T OFTEN HEREABOUT AWHEN THA PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS OR AMTHERAPUTIC AND CHONOLOGY THESE THINGS ALSO HAVE THEIR APUTIC USES AM IN THE A ENDICRIN SETTING SO FOR INSTANCE KIDS THAT DON'T UNDERGO PUBERTY OR KIDS THAT ARE HYPOCANATL OR ADULTS THEIR HYPOGANATLE THEY'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH HORMON WILL TAKE THINGS LIKE KISPEPTON AMONG OTHER THINGS SO THAT'S HOW PUBERTY HAPPENS THAT THE BIOLOGICAL LEVEL GETS TRIGGER BY LEPTON IN KISPEPTON AND THEN THIS YOUNG CHILD IS NOW A DIFFERENT CREATURE TO SOME TO SOME EXTENT NOT JUST BECAUSE THEIR REPRODUCTIVELY COMPETEN OF COURSE BUT BECAUSE THERE'S A SHIFT IN A NUMBER OF THE THINGS THAT UNDERLIE THESE SOCIAL BONDS THERE ARE THERE'S A MARKED SHIFT IN A NUMBER OF THE THINGS THAT A LOU CHILDREN AND ADULTS TO ENGAGE IN PREDICTIVE BEHAVIOR ABOUT EACH OTHER AND THE WHOLE NATURE OF ADOLESCENCE IN PUBERTY IS TO TAKE A CHILD THAT WAS A GENERALIST AND TO MAKE THEM A SPECIALIST AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT RELATES THE CONVERSATION ABOUT EMOTIONALITY BUT IT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF ALL ASPECTS OF BRAIN FUNCTION AND IN TERMS OF LEARNING AND IN TERMS OF WHO EACH IN EVERY ONE OF US WILL AND HAS BECOME IN ADOLESCENCE AND IN CHILDHOOD SURE THERE ARECEN GENETIC BIASES YOU KNOW HAIR COLOR I COLOR HEIGHT IN THIGS THAT A LOT OF THAT'S PROGRAMMED INTO THE GENO THERE ARE OTHER GENETIC BIASIS TOO OF COURSE THAT WE INHERIT BUT IT'S IN ADOLESCENCE IN PUBERTY THAT WE GO FROM ESSENTIALLY BEING SOMEWHAT GOOD AT A BUNCH OF THINGS OR SOMEWHAT POORID A BUNCH OF THINGS TO BE COMING VERY GOOD AT A FEW THINGS AND VERY POOR AT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO PUBERTY AND NUROW PLASTICITY THIS ABILITY TO CHANGE THE BRAIN IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE IS STARTING TO TAKE PER OFF SUCH THAT BY OUR EARLY TWENTIES IT'S HARDER TO ACHIEVE NOW THE TRANSITION FROM GENERALIST TO SPECIALIST IS ONE ASPECT OF ADOLESCENCE IN PUBERTY BUT THE OTHER IS THE FORMATION OF SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BONDS AND MOST OF WHAT CONSUMES THE MINDS AND WAKING HOURS OF ADOLESCENCE AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH PUBERTY AND GOING THROUGH PUBERTY IS QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THEY RELATE TO SOCIAL STRUCTURES WHO THEY CAN RELY ON AND HOW THEY CAN MAKE RELIABLE PREDICTIONS IN THE WORLD NOW THAT THEY HAVE MORE AGENCY THAT THEY ARE PHYSICALLY CHANGED IN FACT YOU COULD ARGUE THAT PUBERTY IS THE FASTEST RATE OMATURATION THAT YOU'LL GO THROUGH AT ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE IT'S THE LARGEST CHANGE THAT YOU'LL GO THROUGH AT ANY POINTIN YOUR LIFE IN TERMS OF WHO YOU ARE BECAUSE YOUR BIOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED AT THE LEVEL OF YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR YOUR BODILY ORGANS ALL YOUR ORGANS FROM THE SKIN INWARD SO I WANT A VISIT A LITTLE BIT OF THE RESEARCH ABOUT SOME OF THE CORN NEEDS THAT A CUR DURING PUBERTY AND ADOLESCENCE NOT JUST FOR PARENTS OR FOR THE PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE IN PUBERTY AND ADOLESCENCE BUT ALSO SO THAT PEOPLE CAN REFLECT ON WHICH OF THE SORT OF A BOXES WERE CHECKED OFF FOR THEM AS THEY APPROACHED EMOTIONAL MATCHER MATURITY SO THERE'S A TERRIFIC REVIEW ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL NATURE WHICH IS IF NOT TE PREMER THAN SERTAINLY AMONG THE TOP THREE PREMEAR JOURNALS IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF ADOLESCENCE AND PUBERTY AS WELL AS SOME OF THE CORE NEEDS AND DEMANDS THAT HAVE TO BE MET FOR SUCCESSFUL EMOTIONAL MATURATION DURING THAT TIME WILL WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT BUT I A JUST ONE A HIGHLIGHT OF FEW OF THE THINGS THAT THEY PLACE IN THE FINAL TABLE I DON'T ONT GO THROUGH LL THE RESULTS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU COUN DO TDOWN YOUR OWN IF POU LIKE THEY MAINLY HIGH LIGHT A LOT OF THE CHANGES IN NURONS AN NURL CIRCUITS FOR INSTANCE ILL JUST HIGHLIKE ONE THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DOPAMINE CENTERS IN THE BRAIN AND AN AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT'S INVOLVED IN EMOTION AND DISPERSAL DISPERSAL IS VERY INTERESTING WHAT YOU OBSERVE IN ANIMALS AN HUMANS IS THAT AROUND THE END OF ADOLESCENCE AND DURING THE TRANSITION TO PUBERTY BOTH BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THE BRAIN AND CHANGES IN HORMONES THERE IS AN INTENSE DESIRE ON THE PARD OF THE CHILD TO GET FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM PRIMARY CARE GIVERS NOT PERMANENTLY THEY ALWAYS RETURN SIMILAR TO A CHILD THAT WALKS OFF AND THEN LOOKS BACK SEES OF EVERYTHING SAFE AND THAN CONTINUES ON DURING ADOLESCENCE IN PUBERTY BOTH IN ANIMALS AND IN KIDS THEREIS IT ALMOST SEEMS LHIKE THERE'S A BIAS FOR ACTION AND THE ACTION IS ALWAYS IN THE DIRECTION AWAY FROM THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER NOW SOON AS I SAY THAT I CAN JUST IMAGINE IN MY MIND THAT SOMEBODY OUT THER SAYING WELL NO MY KID AS SOON AS THEY HYPPUBERTY THEY JUST WANE TO STAY HOME WITH US ALL THE TIME THAT'S NOT TYPICAL IT HAPPENS BUT IT'S NOT TYPICAL MOSTLY THERE'S A DESIRE TO START SPENDING MORE TIME WITH FRIENDS MORE TIME WITH PEERS AND LESS TIME WITH ADULTS AND I FIND IT EXTREMELY INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THAT'S NOT JUST TRUE IN HUMANS THAT'S TRUE IN OTHER PRIMATE SPECIES THAT'S TRUE IN RODENTS THAT'S TRUE AND ALMOST EVERY OTHER MAMALIAN SPECIES SO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THESE HORMONES THAT DON'T JUST ALLOW SEXUAL REPRODUCTION THEY DON'T JUST CHANGE THE BRAIN INBODILY ORGANS IN THE SHAPE OF OF US THEY ALSO BIAS US TOWARDS DISPERSAL GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM PRIMARY CAREGIVERS IN PARTICULARS SO PARENTS OF TEAN AGORS OR FUTURE TEAN AGERS IT IS NOT JUST NORMAL IT IS BAKED IN TO THE BIOLOGY OF HUMANS TO DISPERSE AROUND ADOLESCENCE AND IN THE TEN YEARS SO AGAIN I JUST WANT O HIGHLIGHT OF FEW OF THESE WHAT WERE LISTED AS INTERVENTION STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE HEALTHY ADOLESCENCE AND PUBRITY AS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THE ENTIRE ARTICLE A I SHOULD MENTION O THE WHO WROTE THIS ARTICLE APOLOGIES AM ONE OF THEM IS IS A FRIEND OF MINE SO AH THE FIRST AUTHOR IS DULL RONAL DULL NOT THE CHALDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR AN ASSUMING A A NO FROM THE SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH AT I UNIVERSY CALFORNIA BIRKLY AM AND NICHOLAS ALLAN LINO WILBRICK AND A ANA BALANHOFV SULEIMAN FORGIVE ME FOR THE PRONUNCIATION LAST ONE I KNOW A DOCTOR WILBRICK QUITE WELL  DONE THE THE WORK ON DISPERSAL IS A QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR FOR THAT WORK AND IT'S A VERY EXTENSIVE REVIEW A BUT I THINK YOU CONFINDED  YOU'LL FIND IT ACCESSIBL LOT OF CHANGES IN THICKNESS OF THE BRAIN AT DIFFERENT STAGES ET CETERA BUT I THINK MOST BE WILL BE INTERESTIN WHAT THAT TRANSLATES TO IN THE IN THE REAL WORLD AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS JURING PUBERTY THERE'S INCREASED CAN CONNECTION CONUCTIVITY AS WE CALL IT BETWEEN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS WHICH IS INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION AND DECISION MAKING BEING ABLE TO SUPPRESS ACTION FOR MAKING LONG TERM A GOALS POSSIBLE A AS WELL AS DOPOMEAN CENTERS AND THE EMIGDOLA SO THERE'S THIS REALLY BROUGHT INTO GRATION AND TESTING I THINK THIS IS THE KEY ELEMENT YOR TESTING OF CIRCUITS FOR EMOTIONS AND REWARD AS THEY RELATE TO DECISIONS AND I THINK THAT'S USEFUL BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLESCENCE AND TEENS THEY ARE TESTING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THEY ARE TESTING PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS WITH THE WORLD OFTENTIMESTHEY'RE ENGAGING IN UNSAFE BEHAVIOR AND YOU CAN'T A JUST I I WOUL NEVER TRYING JUSTIFY THAT WITH WITH THE UNDERLYING NEUROLOGY BUT THE NOUROL SCIENCE POINTS TO INCREASED CONACTIVITY BETWEEN AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE RELATED TO EMOTIONALITY AND A TO THREAT DETECTION LIKE THEY MIG DULA BUT ALSO REWARD SO IT'S A TIME OF TESTING BEHAVIORLY HOW DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS LEAD TO SUCCESS OR NOT IT'S HOW DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS LEAD TO FIER STATES OR NOT NOW OF COURE YOU COUN SAY THAT OF ANY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE PUBERTY IS A IS A VERY VERY HEIGHTENED STAGE IN WHICH TESTING OF CONTINGENCIES GOOD OR BAD IS TAKING PLACE AND OF COURSE THIS IS HAPPENING IT'S OPERATING IN A BODY THAT'S NOW MORE CAPABLE THAN THE INFANT SO AN INFANT CAN CAN DAMAGE THEMSELVES THROUGH ERROR BUT IT'S HARDER FOR THEM TO DAMAGE THEMSELVES THROUGH DELIBERATE PLANNING YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT OF COURSE TO LOCK UP ALL THE MEDICATIONS IN THE HOUSE MAKE SURE INFANTS CAN GET TO THEM BUT IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT THAT INFANT IS GOING TO DEVISE AN EXTREMELY DIABOLICAL PLAN TO GET INTO THE CABINET TO GET A CERTAIN SUBSTANCE WHEREAS A TEANAGER MIGHT RIGHT AH SO YOU CONSTRUCT TE MAP THE NEUROLOGY ON TO SOME OF THIS EMOTIONAL EXPLORATION I DO REALIZE THAT THIS EPISODES ABOUT EMOTIONS PUBEITIES OF TIME IN WHICH THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE PERSON OR THE ANIMAL IS BEING SAMPLED AND TESTED AGAINST DIFFERENT EXTRACEPTIVE EVENTS ONLY NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO GUIDE THOSE EVENTS WITH MORE AGENCY RIGHT IT'S NO LONGER JUST ABOUT WHETHER NOT THE CAREGIVER IS BRINGING YOU MILK OR BRINGING YOU FOOD OF COURSE THE PARENTS WILL ALL SAY YET BUT I'M PAYING FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEI'RE DOING ON PAYING FOR THE CAR AND ON PAYING FOR THE FOOD AH TRUE BUT THE BIOLOGY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE SOURCE THE CHILD OR THE ADOLESCENT IS NOW ABLE THE TEEN REALLY IS ABLE TO NOW SAMPLE MANY MANY MORE EXTRACEPTIVE EVENTS THROUGH BEHAVIOR SO SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE INTERESTING THE THEORY IS THAT ONE OF THE MOTIVATIONS IS TO LEARN TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF FAMINEINE MAL NUTRITION AS TEEN AGERS GET OLDER THEY START QUESTIONING WHETHER NOT THEIR PARENTS ARE EVERYTHING THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE WHETHER NOT THO THE GREATEST THING THAT EVER WAS OR THE WORST THING THAT EVER WAS PERHAPS INCLUDING WHETHER NOT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM RESOURCES SO THEY TEST WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN ACTUALLY FEED THEMSELVES WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN SUPPORT THEMSELVES ALTHOUGH RARELY NOT CERTAINLY IT HAPPENS BUT RARELY ARE THEY  REALLY TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES ALTHOUGH SOME TEENS ARE FORCED TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES OF COURSE HISE PARENTS ANOTHER CARETAKERS ARE AN AVAILABLE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MAP TO THE BIOLOGY INCLUDE LATER THERE'S BEEN A BIG PUSH FOR LATER START TIMES IN SCHOOLS TO MATCH THEIR SHIFTS INCIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND THE NEED FOR EXTENDED SLEEP SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE SLEEP EPISODES AH TO INSIST ON SLEEP INTERVENTIONS FOR YOUTH WHO ARE AT INCREASE RISK FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ALMOST EVERY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE IS SUPPORTED BY I GETTING REGULAR QUALITY SLEEP OF SUFFICIENT DURATION SUFFICIENT DURATIONS CAN A VERY FROM PERSON A PERSON LEVERAGING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT REENFORCE POSITIVE BEHAVIOR THIS IS STARTING THE SOUND LIKE KIND OF BOILER PLATE STUFF AND YET REALLY THE GOAL IS DURING PUBRITY TO ENCOURAGE AS MANY THEY SAFE FORMS OF INTERACTION THAT ALLOW CHILDREN TEENS REALLY AND ADOLESCENCE I KEEP CALLING THEM CHILDREN BUT WHAT I MEAN OUR PEOPLE CHILDREN GOING THROUGH PUBRITY THAT ALLOW THEM TO TEST THIS THING OF AUTONOMY SO THAT THEY CAN START TO MAKE GOOD ASCESSMENTS ABOUNT THERE EXTRAACCEPTIVE EVENTS THAT THEY ARE SELECTING AND HOW THOSE MAKE THEM FEEL INTERNALLY SO THERE RE SENTIALLY DOING A BUFFET THE BUFFET HAS NOW BROUD IN TO NOT JUST INCLUDE THE EVENTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT THEIR PARENTS AND OTHER CARETAKERS BRING THEM BUT THEY CAN NOW EXPAND THE BUFFET INTO THINGS THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE THEMSELVES AND SO ADOLESCENTS AND PUBRITY IS REALLY SEEN AS THE PERIOT IVE DEVELOPMENT IN WHICH ONES SELF SAMPLES FOR THESE TWO ELEMENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING WHICH ARE HOW DO I FORM BONDS AND HOW DO I MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT WILL MAKE ME FEEL GOOD AT A LEVEL OF INTERRACEPTION SOME OF THAT MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE TRANSACTIONAL YOU KNOW THAT ALL WERE TRYING TO DO AS FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BOND WITH PEOPLES WE CAN GET WHAT WE NEED SO WE CAN FEEL HOW WE NEED I THINK THAT'S TRUE TO SOME EXTENT OF COURSE THERE IS A RICHER MORE ON A ABSTRACT ASPECT TO RELATIONSHIPS TOO WHICH ARE YOU KNOW IN RELATIONSHIPS YOU CAN ACCESS THINGS YOU COULDN'T DO BEFORE YOU CAN COOPERATE THEIRE THINGS LIKE TEAM WORK YOU CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT INTERMS THE BIOLOGY IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE IS THE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT WHERE MORE AUTONOMY MORE PHYSICAL CAPABILITY IS TRIGGERED BY THESE HORMONE CHANGES IN THE BRAIN AND THESE PEPTITE CHANGES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND THAT NONE THE LESS BRINGS US BACK TO THE EXACT SAME MODEL THAT WE STARTED WITH AN INFANCY OF ALERT OR CALM FEEL GOOD OR FEEL BAD PRIMARILY EXTRAACCEPTING PROMARILY INTERRACEPTIN SO I KEEP GOING BACK TO THIS I'M SORT OF LIKE O REPEATING RECORD ON THAT BECAUSE THE SAME CORE ALGARITHM THE SAME CORE FUNCTION IS AT PLAY THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN AND THAT'S A USEFUL FRAMEWORK IN MY OPINION BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO SORT THROUGH ALL THE DATA AND INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THEREABOUT WHELL THIS AR THSTRIA TERMINALIS IS ACTIVE OR THE BASILATERAL MIGGALA'S ACTIVE OR GREY MATTER THICKENING OR THIS HORMON ER THAT HARMON AND RETURN TO A KIND OF CERNAL OF CERTAINLY NOT EXHAUSTIVE TRUTH TIT DOESN'T COVER ALL ASPECTS OF EMOTIONALITY BUT AT LEAST ESTABLISHES SOME GROUND WORK FROM WHICH YOU CAN START TO EVALUATE HOW DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE HOW CERTAIN EMOTIONAL RESPONSES MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE REGARDLESS OF THE AGE OF THE PERSON OR THE ORGANISM A DISCUSSION ABOUT EMOTIONS WOULD NOT BE COM PLY WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT BRAIN LEFT BRAIN STUFF AND THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING ASPECT OF SOCIOLOGY PSYCHOLOGY AND NURO SCIENCE THEREIS A THEORY OF EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT I FIND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING WHICH IS FROM ALANSHORE YOU SALE THE TALKS ABOUT HOW MOST OF OUR TESTING OF BONDS AND RELATIONSHIPS IS THIS SEA SAWING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN VERY DOPOMINRGIC SO DRIVEN BY DOPOMINE OR CERETONERGEIC DRIVEN BY CERATONAN STATES AND THIS STARTS WITH INFANT AND MOTHER OR INFANT AN FATHER I TALK TO LOBIT ABOUT THIS IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT JUST TO REMIND YOU OR FOR ANY ONE THAT DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT IT THAT DURING DEVELOPMENT HEALTHY EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT CLEARLY BEGINS WITH IN ABILITY FOR THE CHARETAKER AND CHILD TO BE IN CALM PEACEFUL SOOTHING TOUCH ORIENTED I GAZING TYPE OF BEHAVIORS THOSE REALLY DRIVE CERTONAN THE INDOGENIS OPIOID SYSTEM A OXYTOSIN THINGS ARE VERY CALMING AND ARE CENTERED AROUND PLEASURE WITH THE HERE AND NOW AS WELL AS EXCITED STATES OF WHAT WERE GOING TO DO NEXT THEREIS ACTUALLY EY A  CHARACTERISTIC SIGN OF THE DOPOMINURGIC INTERACTION WHERE BOTH CARETAKER AND CHILD HAVE ARE WIDE EYED THE PUPILS DILATE THATS SIGNATURE OF AROUSAL THEY GET REALL EXCITED OFTENTIMES THE BABY WILL LOOK AWAY IF IT GETS REALLY EXCITED THAT THOSE ARE SIGNATURES OF DOPOMINE RELEASE IN THE BODY AND IN ADOLESCENCE THESE SAME THINGS CARRY FORWARD WHERE THEIR GOOD BONDS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH HANGING ROUND WATCHING T V JUST KIND OF BEING ER UNO PLANGVIDIO GAMES ARE TEXTING TOGETHER OR TALKING WHATEVER IT IS THAT THE THE SOOTHING LOCAL ACTIVITY HAPPENS TO BE AS WELL AS ADVENTURE AN THINGS THAT ARE EXCITING SO IT COULD BE SPORTS IT COULD BE SHOPPING IT COULD BE A SUMMER ADVENTURE IT COULD BE THE NEXT BIG THING AND SO THIS KIND OF SEASAWING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEIR DIFFERENT REWARD SYSTEMS SEEMS TO BE THE BASIS FROM WHICH HEALTHY EMOTIONAL BONDS ARE CREATED AND I INVITE ANYONE WHOSE INTEREST IN THIS TO A LOOK UP SOME OF A DOCTOR SHORE'S WORK ON I THINK I MISSPOKE ON THE LAST EPISODE IS NOT A PSYCHATROCES A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND PSYCHOANALYST BUT HAS DEEP ROODINGS IN NAURO SCIENCE AS AS IF I THINK OF FASCINATING ASPECT BUT THE WAY ITS FRAMED IN THAT BOOK AND IN HIS BOOK AND IN SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AROUND THAT S A ROUND RIGHT BRAIN LEFT BRAIN AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THIS STUFF BEFORE THAT THE RIGHT BRAIN IS THOUGHT TO BE THE EMOTIONAL SIDE THIS IS THE CHARACTERISTIC THING THAT YOU HEAR OUT THERE THAT THE RIGHT BRAIN IS HOLISTIC THAT IT'S EMOTIVE AND THAT THE LEFT BRAIN IS LOGICAL SEQUENTIAL AND ANALYTIC AND ON THAT'S NOT WHAT SHORE WAS PROPOSING ON THERE ARE SOME RIGHT BRIN LEFT BRAINE DIFFERENCES BUT THE IDEA THAT THE RIGHT BRAIN IS SYNTHETIC HOLISTIC AND EMOTIVE AND THAT THE LEFT BRAIN IS LOGICAL SEQUENTIAL AND ANALYTIC IS FALSE THERE IS ZERO NERROL SCIENCE A VIDENCE FOR THAT WHATSOEVER WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS IND MORE DETAIL DURING A MONTH TALKING ABOUT LEARNING AND MEMORY AND DOMENTIA BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME TRUTHS SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LEFT BRAIN AND RIGHT BRAIN BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT A MOTION WITHOUT DOING THAT THE LEFT BRAIN AT LEAST FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT HANDED IS LINGUISTICALLY DOMINANT MEANING MOST OF LANGUAGE IS CENTERED IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BRAIN FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE IF YOU WERE A LEFT HANDER AND YOU WERE FORCED TO BECOME RIGHT HANDED CHANCES ARE THIS IS STILL TRUE BECAUSE OF WHEN LANGUAGE GETS LAID DOWN IN THE BRAIN FOR LEFT HANDERS PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE THAT NATURALLY RIGHT WITH THEIR LEFT HAND AND ALWAYS DID LANGUAGE IS STILL MOSTLY IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BRAIN BUT IT'S ALSO FOUND MORE OFTEN IN THE RIGHT SIDE OFTHE BRAIN SO IT'S NOT AS LATTERALIZED AS WE SAY IT'S KIND OF DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN BOTH SO RIGHT HANDERS MOST YOUR LANGUAGES COMING FROM THE LEFT SIDE YOUR BRAIN LEFT HANDERS IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLEBIT MORE EVENLY ISTRIBUTED AND THERE ARE SOME VARIATIONS WHETHER NOT YOU'R A HOOK RIGHTY OR A HOOK LEFTY THERE'S ALL SORTS OF NEWANTS TO THIS BUT THAT'S THE THE GENERAL ASPECT SO LANGUAGE TENDS TO BE CENTERED IN THE LEFT SIDE THE BRAIN AND THAT INCLUDES LEXICON GRAMMAR INTACTS ALL OF IT EXCEPT FOR ONE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT ONE ASPECT OF LANGUAGE THAT SEEMS TO BE MORE RIGHT BRAIN THAT'S VERY INTERESTING THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME ARITHMETIC ADVANTAGE SO ABILITY AN MATH IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BRAIN NOMON TO TALK ABOUT HOW ALL THIS WAS DISCOVERED IN A MINUTE THE RIGHT BRAIN HOWEVER IS LINGUISTICALLY PRIMITIVE MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THUS BECAUE THE RIGHT BRAIN AS ALWAYS DESCRIBED AS THE EMOTIVE SIDED AT SUPEREMOTIONAL AND HOLISTIC BUT IT'S ACTUALLY LINGUISTICALLY PRIMITIVE AND THERE'S A WAIGT THAT THAT'S BEEN TEASED OUT THROUGH EXPERIMENT IT'S VERY GOOD AT MANIPULATING SPACIAL THINGS AND VISUAL SPACIAL TASKS IT'S PRIMARILY HANDLING THAT STUFF BUT IT'S SORT OF NON LANGUAGE EXCEPT ONE ASPECT AND THERE ISN'T A TON OF EVIDENCE FOR THIS BUT THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG WHICH IS PROCIDY PROCIDI IS THE LILTING AND FALLING OF LANGUAGE SO A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE ITALIAN I DON'T SPEAK ITALIAN I ONLY KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF ITALIAN BUT THE MOST THE ITALIAN I KNOW IS ON WHEN MY ITALIAN COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID TO ME MACOSETICI WHICH MEANS LIKE WHAT YOU TRYN AN A SAY WHAT YOU SAYING I  I THINK I'M GETTING THAT RIGHT BUSY THERE SAYING I DON'T SPEAK ITALIAN WHICH IS TRUE OR AH BECAUSE ONE OF THEM KNOWS AND LOVES COSTELLO VERY MUCH THEY ALWAYS SAY UMPIGONE WHICH MEANS BIG LAZY GUY WHICH ACCURATELY CAPTURES COSTELLO SO EVEN THOSE FEW EXAMPLES RIGHT MACOSETTICI UMPIGRONE THERE'S A LOT OF LILT AND FALL IN ITALIAN OTHER LANGUAGEIS NOT SO MUCH AND IT VARIES BY LANGUAGE HON O THE REASONS I FIND ITALIAN SO BEAUTIFUL NOT THE ITALIAN I SPEAK BUT THE ITALIAN THAT OTHER PEOPLE SPEAK SO BEAUTIFUL TO LISTEN TO IS THAT THAT PROCIDY AND THAT THE SHIFTS AND INTONATION ARE REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE THAT'S ALMOST LIKE A SENE SONG I LISTENING TO THE TO THEM SPEAK AND I SELIKE TO GO TO SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS AND I ALWAYS HANG OUT WITH THE ITALIANS CAUSE IE SOM GOOD FRIENDS IN ITALIAN LAPS BUT ALSO COL THEY ALWAYS KNEW WHERE THE BEST FOOD WAS THEIR STANDARDS FOR FOOD ARE INCREDIBLE THEY WOULD RATHER STARVE THAN HE TERRIBLE POSTA AND THE POSTA THEY DO FIND AND THAT THERE WILL INDEED IS ALWAYS FANTASTIC BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY LWAYS BROUGHT A GUITAR THEY WERE NOT MORE FUND THAN A LOT OF MY OTHER A  CALWAYS TO HANG OUT WITH AT MEETINGS SO IN ANY EVENT THE RIGHT BRAIN IS DOING THINGS THAT ARE MORE ABOUT MANIPULATING SPATIAL INFORMATION AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS MORN OF FUTURE EPISODE BUT I THIS WAS DISCOVERED IN SPLIT BRAIN PATIENTS OF PEOPLE THAT LACK CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO SCIDES OF THE BRAIN AND IT THIS HAD TO BE TEASED OUT THROUGH VERY COMPLICATED EXPERIMENTS PEOPLE LIKE ROGER SPARRY WHO WANT TO KNOW ABLE PRIZE FOR THIS WHO IS AT CALTAC MIGHT GAZANAGA AND OTHERS FIGURED OUT THESE LATERALIZED DIFFERENCES BUT LET'S JUST TRY AND DEMOLISH THE MYTH THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE RIGHT SIDE IS SYNTHETIC AND HOLISTIC AND A MOTIVE AND THAT THE LEFT SIDE IS LOGICAL SEQUENTIAL AND ANALYTIC THAT YOU'RE A LEFT BRAIN PERSON ORE RIGHT BRAIN PERSON NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT AND THERE'S A FEW LEISION STUDIES THAT CAN TEASE OUT EFFECTS THAT MAKE YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT THE REALLY CAREFUL WORK POINTS IN ITS WHOLALLY DIFFERENT DIRACTION WE CAN'T HAVE A COMPLETE CONVERSATION ABOUT EMOTIONS AND BONDS AND SOCIAL CONNECTION WITHOUT TALK ABOUT OXYTOSIN OXYTOSIN HAS COME TO SUCH PROMINENTS IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO AND SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE ANY TIME YOU HEAR A DISCUSSION ABOUT NURASIGNS IN THE BRAIN OR HORMONS IN THE BRAIN OXYTOSIN IS RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO LACTATION IN FEMALES IT IS RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO SEXUAL INTERACTIONS IT IS RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO NONSEXUAL TOUCH IT'S RELEASED IN MALES AND FEMALES AND INDEED IT'S INVOLVED IN PERBONDING AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SOCIAL BONDS IN GENERAL HOW IT DOES THAT SEEMS TO BE BY MATCHING INTERNAL STATE IT SEEMS TO BOTH INCREASE SYNCRANY OF INTERNAL STATES SOMEHOW MAYBE IT SETS A LEVEL OF CALMNESS OR ALERTNESS THAT SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE HYPOTHESIS AS WELL AS RAISING PEOPLE'S AWARENESS FOR THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF THEIR PARTNER AND AGAIN THIS BRINGS US BACK TO THIS ALERTNESS CALMNESS AXIS AND THIS INTEROCEPTIVE EXTROCEPTIVE AXIS IN ORDER TO FORM GOOD BONDS WE CAN'T JUST BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE FEEL WE ALSO NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION HOW OTHERS FEEL AND WERE EVALUATIN A MATCH WE'RE TRYING TO SEE WHETHER NOT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF SYNCRANY BETWEEN STATES AND OXYTOSIN BOTH SEEMS TO INCREASE THAT SYNCRONY AN END INCREASE THE AWARENESS FOR THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF OTHERS OW I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY SCREAMING MIRORNURONS MIRONURONS MIROR NURONS AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW AND SOME OF YOU PERHAPS MAY NOT ARE NURONS THAT WERE DISSCOVERED INANIMALS AND HUMANS FOR THEIR ABILITY TO RESPOND WHEN PEOPLE ENGAGED IN CERTAIN PHYSICAL ACTIONS LIKE LIFTING OF F A PEN BUT THE SAME NURONS WOULD RESPOND WHEN SOMEBODY WATCH SOME ONE ELSE LIFT A PEN SO THEY WERE REALLY MIRORS OF WERE REPRESENTING MIRORS OF BEHAVIOR BOTH IN SELF AND IN OTHERS MIROR NURONS ARE VERY CONTROVERSIAL THEIRE MANY NUR ASCIENTIST WHO I RESPECT A LOT WHO DON'T THINK THEY EXIST BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT THE DATA AND THE DATA AT LEAST IN THEIR MIND WERE OVER INTERPRETED IN THE REALM OF EMPATHY AND IN ASSIGNING VALUE TO THE EMOTIONAL STATES OF OTHERS AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE LITERATURE MY OPINION IS THAT INDEED THERE ARE NURONS IN THE BRAIN THAT CLEARLY REPRESENT THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THEYRE WIRED INTO THE EMOTION IN EMPATHY SYSTEM IN ANY DIRECT WAY AND I THINK THE GROWING CONSENSUS IS THAT MIROR NURONS WHILE THE NAME IS TERRIFIC IS AND SO CATCHY A AND ENCOMPASSES SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU LOVE FOR IT TO ENCOMPASS BUT THAT THE DATA DON'T REALLY SUPPORT THAT BUT THIS IS CONTROVERSIAL AND I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY TO A GET EXPERTS ON HERE THAT COULD DEBATE IT A BETTER THAN I COULD THERE ARE HOWEVER NIRONS IN THE BRAIN THAT WERE DISCOVERED BY MY COLLIGUE CARIN HERUCHE AT STAMFORD WHEN SHE IS WORKING IN NOMSIVSLAB THAT CLEARLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT PRIMATE SPECIES ARE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS AND ARE TRYING TO PREDICT THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHER MEMBERS OF THEIR SPECIES IT'S AN EXPERIMENT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO IN REAL DETAIL WHICH MI JUST GET CARRING ON HERE FOR THOSE OF YOU TAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE PRISONERS DILEMMA WHICH IS REALLY A A MODEL OF COOPERATION YOU CAN EITHER COOPERATE OR ONE CAN ONE MEMBER OF A GIVEN INTERACTION CAN COOPERATIN THE OTHER ONE WON'T WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN BOTH NOT COOPERATE THEIR WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN SOLVE THE SO CALLED PRISONERS DILEMMA BY LOOKING AT PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR AND MAKING PREDICTIONS ABOUT THAT LIKELY NEXT BEHAVIOR THAT THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL WILL ENGAGE IN AND THERE DO SEEM TO BE NURONS THAT ARE DOING THESE SORTS OF PREDICTIONS ARE COMPUTATIONS AND OUHT AGAIN AT ALL GO IN TO THIS AND MORE DETAIL IN THE FUTURE SO THAT RATHER THN THING ABOUT MIRONURONS LIKE NURONS FOR EMPATHY I THINK IT'S MORE CORRECT TO THINK ABOUT NURONS THAT ARE TRYING TO PREDICT THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHERS AND THAT'S AS WE SAID ONE OF THE COR FEATURES OF EMOTIONS WHICH ARE TO TO ESTABLISH BONDS AND THROUGH THOSE BONS TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT BEHAVIOR SO OXYTOSIN IS ONE COMPONENT OF THE S ABILITY TO PREDICT OTHERS BEHAVIOR AND TO GUIDE OUR OWN BEHAVIOR SO HERSOME IT EXPERIMENTS THAT INVOLVED THE ADMINISTRATION OF OF INTRENASAL OXY TOSIN THIS IS OCTUALLY PEOPLE NOW I THINK YOU NEED A PRESCRIPTION ALTHOUGH IN SOME PLACES YOU DON'T THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING INTRENASAL OXY TOSIN IN ORDER TO TRY AND INCREASE THE DEPTH OF BONDING AND I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU DO THAT I'VE NEVER TRIED THAT I WHATEVER OXYTOSIN I'VE RELEASED I'VE MADE WITHOUT THE N INTRENASAL A EXOGENOUS APPLICATION BUT WHAT'S BEEN REPORT IT IS INCREASE POSITIVE COMMUNICATION AMONG COUPLES SO PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN INTRENASAL OXY TOSIN IN STUDIES SO THAT STUDY JUST IF YOU FOR THOSE WHO LIKE WAS PUBLISHIN BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIOTRY WHICH MY SI KATRY COLLES TELL ME IS A FINE JOURNAL AND THE TITLE IS INTRNASAL OY TOSIN INCREASES POSITIVE COMMUNICATION AND REDUCES THE STRESSWORM ON CORTISALL LEVELS DURING COUPLE CONFLICT THEY HAVE THEM FIGHT ER THEY HAVE THEM FIGHT WITHOUT WITHEN WITHOUT OXY TOSIN SO INTERESTING UM VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE IDEA THE OXYTOSIN IS THE COTENQO TRUST HORMON THAT SORT IN KEEPING WITH THAT THOUS A TWO THOUSAND NINE PAPER THERE'S OTHER EVIDENCE FOR INSTANCE THAT MEN REPORT A GREATER SENSE OF CONNECTION AND INTIMACY WITH THEIR PARTNERS DURING SECTS AFTER TAKING INTRENASAL OXY TOSIN THERE ARE STUDIES IN OCTISTIC CHILDREN GIVING THEM INTRENASAL OXY TOSIN IS A WAGED TO TRY AND HELP THEM ESTABLISH BETTER SOCIAL CONNECTION AND QUOTIN QUO EMPATHY OR THEORY OF MIND HAVE TALKED ABOUT THEORY OF MINE BEFORE WERE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OTHER CHILDREN OR AND ADULTS ARE EXPERIENCING SO YOU DON'T OXY TOSIN DOES SEEM TO CREATE THESE GENERAL EFFACTS AND HOW NUANTS THEY ARE IN ONE SITUATIONER OR ANOTHER I DON'T KNOW I I'M AWARE AND I WAS TOLD AND I'M DEAFLY NOT RECOMMENDING THIS THAT  THERE'S A A MARKETED OXY TOSIN KEDEMINE NASAL SPRAY NOW I HAVE NO IDEA MAYBE SOME ONE CAN AN PUT IN THE COMMENTS WHY YOU'D WANT TO COMBINE OXY TOSIN IN KEDEMINE I CAN'T IMAGIN WHY CEDEMINE IS A DISSOCIATIVE AND AESTHETIC THAT'S USE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PITIESTI I USED TO BE USED AS A RECREATIONAL DRUG UM IT IT'S A VERY SIMILAR TO PIECI P SEEMS QUITE DANGEROUS IN FACT UM I DON'T KNOW WHY THOSE TWO THINGS WOULD A BE COMBINED A WHY ONE WOULD WANT TO COMBINE THEM BUT UM THERE ARE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT SEEM TO COMBINE THOSE TWO THINGS IN AND I'M NOT CERTAIN WHY A ONE WOULD DO THAT BUT IT'S IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT IT'S HAPPENING A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING STUDY ABOUT OXY TOSIN IS THAT THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF NARROW SCIENCE WHICH IS A GOOD JOURNAL THAT OXY TOSIN MODULATE SOCIAL DISTANCE BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES SO THEIS INTERESTING WHAT THEY DID IS THEY GAVE OXY TOSIN TO PEOPLE THAT WERE IN MONOGYMOUS RELATIONSHIPS AND THEN THEY EVALUATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE IN THIS CASE THE MALES IN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WOULD A PAY ATTENTION TO VISUAL ATTENTION TO ATTRACTIVE OTHER A POTENTIAL PARTNERS AND IT SEEMED LIKE THAT THE GENERAL TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY IS THAT OXYTOSIN ADMINISTRATION SEEM TO PROMOTE MONOGAMIUS BEHAVIOR SO BEHAVIOR THAT WAS IN LINE WITH MONOGAMY OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY WERE IN AS OPPOSED TO A FORGING FOR POTENTIALLY NEW MATES NOW OF COURSE THESE ARE SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL EXPERIMENTS OR VERY ARTIFICIAL EXPERIMENTS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU INTERPRET THEM BUT THE GENERAL THEME IS THAT OXYTOSIN IS PROMOTING MONOGAMY IT'S PROMOTING PARABONDING ITS PROMOTING A UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERNAL STATE OF OTHERS WHICH REQUIRES ENHANCED EXTURECEPTION FOR THOSE PARTICULAR OTHERS SO NOT JUST GENERALLY HAVING THEM LOOK EVERYWHERE AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD BUT PARTICULARLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE EMOTIONAL STATES OF OTHERS I'M SURE SEVERAL OF YOU WILL BE ASKING WELL WHAT CAN I DO TO INCREASE OXYTOSIN I IF THAT'S YOUR GOAL THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE AND I IDVITE YOU AGAIN TO TO GO TO EXAMINED OT COM OR ANOTHER SUCH SIGHT LIKE A PUBMET IF YOU WANT A FORGE PUBMET THAT VIT EM INDE IS REQUIRED FOR PROPER PRODUCTION AND IN SOME CASES CAN INCREASE LEVELS OF OXYTOSIN WHEN SUPPLEMENTED WHICH IS INTERESTING AND THAT BELIEVE ARE NOT MELATONAN ORE OLD FROM MELATONAN WHICH I HAVE PUSHED BACK AGAINST AS A SUPPLEMENT A FOR SLEEP BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE A WHAT I VIEW AS UNTOWARD SIDE EFFECTS OF MELATONAN IN MOST CASES AM BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MELATONIIN SOME CASES CAN A CAN PRIME THE SYSTEM FOR SLIGHTLY INCREASED OXYTOSIN RELEASE THERE'S EVEN ONE REPORT ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T LOOK THAT STRONG TO ME THAT A LODOSES OF CAFINE COULD INCREASE OXYTOSIN RELEASE BUT THAT TO ME FALLS UNDER THE CATEGORY OF WHAT A WAS ONCE DESCRIBED AS A DRUG WHEN INJECTED INTO A PERSON OR ANIMAL IS ALWAYS EFFECTIVE IT PRODUSING A SCIENTIFIC PAPER MEANING THAT YOU CAN GET A RESULT BUT THE RESULT IS INTO ALWAYS SO ROBUST SO YOU ALWAYS WANT A RED PASS THE TITLES IN THE OBSTRAXS AND GET INTO THE MEAT OF THE PAPER AND WHEN I DID THAT THE EFFECTS WERE WERE PRETTY NEGLIGIBLE WITH CAFINE ON OXYTOSIN BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT VITEM INDEE AND MELATONAN MAY HAVE SOME PAUSIVE EFFECTS ON OXYTOSIN RELEASE BUT LIE A SAID MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST TAKING OXYTOSIN DIRECTLY THROUGH THESE INTRENASAL A SPRAYS I'M PRETTY SUREITS PRESCRIPTION IN MOST PLACES BUT A BUT CHECK AND AGAIN I AM NOT RECOMMENDING ANYBODY DO THAT I'VE NEVER TRIED IT I DON'T KNOW THEY WILL I THNK IMON A STICK WITH THE OXYTOSIN THAT I'VE GOT THE OTHER MOLECULE THAT WE MAKE THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR SOCIAL BONDS IN EMOTIONALITY IS ONE THATWERE GAN TA TALK ABOUT MORE IN THE MONTH ON HORMONES  THAT'S VESO PRESSIN VESO PRESSIN SUPPRESSES URINATION IT WAS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED A IT'S MADE BY THE BODY BUT IT'S IT WAS DEVELOPED AS A TREATMEN FOR SOMETHING CALLED DIABEDIES INSIPITUS WHERE PEOPLE URINATE EXCESSIVELY AND THEY ACTUALLY WRISTY HYDRATION AND THEY CAN LOSE A LOT OF ELECTROLITES ET CETERA SO CAUSES WATER RETENTION ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION INHIBITS VES OPPRESSIN SO LARGE AMOUNTS OF ALCOL MADE PEOPLE EXCRETE A LOT OF FLUID AND SO FORTH THESE OPPRESS AND HAS EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN DIRECTLY IT ACTUALLY CREATES FEELINGS OF GIDDY LOVE IT ALSO INCREASES MEMORY IN VERY POTENT WAYS THERE IS A WHOLE BIOHACKING COMMUNITY THAT A HAS BEEN DABBLING WITH VEZOPPRESSIN FOR SOME TIME I HAVE NEVER TRIED IT I CERTAINLY DON'T RECOMMEND IT IS PRESCRIPTION AND IT IS A PRETTY SERIOUS COMPOUND OM TO START A YOU KNOW MESSING WITH O BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY DIFFERENT EFFECTS IN THE BODY IT'S IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT CREATES THE SENSE OF GIDDY LOVE ITS IT'S ALSO USED O SOMEWHAT AS AN APHRODESIAC SO IT SIMILAR TO OXITOSIN IT ALSO HAS VERY INTERESTING EFFECTS ON MONOGAMIUS OR NONMONOGAMIUS BEHAVIOR THIS AGAIN WE WILL REVISIT IN THE FUTURE BUT THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL SET OF EXPERIMENTS THT HAVE BEEN DONE IN A LITTLE RODANT SPECIES CALLED A PRAIRIE VOL AN TURNS OUT THEIR TWO DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF PRAIRIEVAL SOMEMER MONOGAMIUS THEY ALWAYS MATE WITH THE SAME OTHER PRARIEVAL AND SOME ARE VERY ROBUSTLY NON MONOGAMIS THEY MATE WITH AS MANY OTHER PRAIRIEVALES AS THEY CAN AND TURNS OUT THAT LEVELS OF VEZOPPRESSIN AND ORVAS OPPRESSIN RECEPTER DICTATE WHETHERNOT THEIR MONOGAMIS OR NOT THERE'S ACISOME INTERESTING EVIDENCE IN HUMANS A WHEN WHEN PEOPLE REPORT THEIR BEHAVIOR ASSUMING THEIR REPORTING ACCURATELY THAT VESOPPRESSIN EVAS OPPRESSIN LEVELS A CAN RELATE TO MONOGAMY OR NON MONOGAMY IN HUMANS AS WELL WEDN A TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE MONTH ON HORMONTS IF WERE TALKN ABOUT THE NERROW SCIENCE OF EMOTIONS WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE VAGIS NERVE I DESCRIBED WHAT THE VAGUS NERVE IS IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE THAT'S THESE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE VICERA INCLUDING THE GUT THE HEART THE LONGS IN THE MUN SYSTEM AND THE BRAIN AND THAT THE BRAIN IS ALSO CONTROLLING THESE ORGANS SO IT'S A TWO WAST STREET THERE'S THIS BIG MITH OUT THERE THAT I MENTION BEFORE THAT STIMULATING THE VAGUS IN VARIOUS WAYS LEADS TO CALMNESS THAT ITS ALWAYS GOIN A CALMU DOWN AND THAT IS FALSE IS ONE REPEAT THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE IN FACT THERE WAS JUST A PAPER YET ANOTHER PAPER PUBLISHED THE OTHER DAY WHICH IS FANTASTIC WHICH IS FROM DAVID CORMIC SLAP UP THE UNIVERSY OF ORGAN PUBLISHING CURRENT BIOLOGY EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOWING I'M JUST READING THE TITLE VAGUEST NERVE STIMULATION INDUCES WIDESPREAD CORTICAL THE NEWQROTECS ENBEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION I'VE READ THE PAPER ITS FANTASTIC IT ILLUSTRATES YET AGAIN STIMULATION OF THE VAGUUS INCREASES DOPEMING RELEASE INCREASES ACTIVATION OF THE BRAIN ALERTNESS IT IS A STIMULANT OF ALERTNESS IT IS NOT CALMING PEOPLE DOWN NOW THIS IS INTERESTING IN LIGHT OF EMOTIONALITY BECAUSE OF WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY MANY GROUPS BUT IN PARTICULAR OMONOFOCUS ON THE WORK OF A COLLEAGUE OF MONCARAL DISEROTH AT STAMFORD WHOSE A SACATRIS BUT AS ALSO DEVELOPED A LOT OF TOOLS TO A JUST THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS IN REAL TIME USING LIGHT AND ELECTRICAL STIMULATION AND SO FORTH I'LL REFER YOU TO AN ARTICLE IN E NEW YORKER THAT WAS PUBLISHED ABOUT THIS A FEW YEARS AGO AN A READ A BRIEF EXCERPT AT A'LL PUT THE THE LINKIN THE CAPTION AS WELL HE'S TALKING TO AN EXTREMELY DEPRESSED SUICIDE A  DEPRESSED PATIENT WHO HAS A SMALL DEVICE IMPLANTED THAT ALLOWS HER TO ADJUST HER VAGUEST NEROF ACTIVITY NOW VAGUEST STIMULATION WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR THE TREATMENT OF APILEPSY IT'S NOW BEING USED FOR VARIOUS OTHER PURPOSES VAGUES STIMULATION CAN EVEN INCREASE PLASTICITY IT SEEMS SO AGAIN INCREASING ACTIVITY OF THE VAGUUS INCREASES ALERTNESS AND IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN REAL TIME TO EMOTIONALITY WHEN THE VAGUEST IS STIMULATED AGAIND NOT CALMING BUT ACTIVATING ALERTNESS THERE IN HIS OFFICE IN THEIR TALKING AND HE ASKS HER HOW SHE'S DOING AND SHE SHE DESCRIBES HOW SHE'S BEEN DOING AS AM PREVIOUSLY AS QUOTINQUOTE GOING PANCAKE WHICH FOR HER DISMEANS TOLLY LAID OUT FLAT NOT MUCH GOING ON SHE TALKS ABOUT HOW SHE DOESN'T WANT TO PURSUE A JOB SHE'S REALLY DEPRESSED A AND HE SAYS IN YOU KNOW TYPICAL GOOD PSYCATROUS FASHION YOU KNOW WILE THAT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT THATS ESURE TH QUOTE AM A AND THEY TALK ABOUT HER BLOOD PRESSURE ET CETERA AND THEN SHE SAYS YOU KNOW MOODS BEEN DOWN JUST SPIRLING DOWN TALKS ABOUT INSOMNIA BAD DREAMS LOW APPETITE SO THIS IS SEVERE DEPRESSION THIS IS WHAT WE CALL MAJOR DEPRESSION AND THEN SHE REQUEST CAN WE PLEASE GO UP TO ONE POINT FIVE ON VAGUES STIMULATION SHE'D BEEN RECEIVING ONE POINT TWO MILLY AMPS OF STIMULATION EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO THIRTY SECONDS BUT WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO FEEL THE EFFECTS SO HE SAYS OK I THINK WE CAN GO UP A LITTLE YOUR TOLERATING THINGS WELL THEY START STIP THE STIMULATION AND QUOTE IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW MINUTES HER NAME WAS SALLY UNDER WENT A REMARKABLE CHANGE HER FROWN DISAPPEARED SHE BECAME CHEERFUL DESCRIBING THE PLEASURE SHE HAD HAD DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY AND RECOUNTING HOW SHE'D RECENTLY WATCHED HIM YOU TWO VIDIOS OF DISERHOH SHE WAS STILL SMILING AND TALKING WHEN THE SESSION ENDED AND THEY WALKED OUT TO THE RECEPTIONARIA SO THIS IS JUST BY STIMULATING AND ACTIVATING THE VAGUUS NOW WHY AM I BRINGING THIS UP WELL FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE IS THE VAGUEST IS FASCINATING IN TERMS OF THE BRAINBODY CONNECTION TOO I'D LIKE TO A KEEP TRYING TO DISPEL THE MYTH THAT VAUEST STIMULATION IS ALL ABOUT BEING CALM IT'S REAL ABOUT BEING ALERT I DO'T KNOW HOW THAT ORIGINALLY GOT GOING BACKWARDS BUT IT'S ABOUT BEING ALERT AND ONCE AGAIN LEVEL OF ALERTNESS OR LEVEL OF CALMNESS IS IMPACTING EMOTION THAT THIS ACCESS OF ALERTNESS AND CALMNESS IS ONE CRIMARY ACIS IN EMOTION IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO THIS VAILANCE COMPONENT OF GOOD OR BAD AND IT'S THOSE TWO AREN'T THE ONLY ONES BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO THIS COMPONENT OF INTER RECEPTIVE EXTA RECEPTIVE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND THERE WILL BE OTHERS TO AGAIN IT'S NODDID XHAUSTIVE BUT I FIND IT FASCINATING AND IT REALLY BRINGS US BACT TO WERE WE STARTED WHICH IS WHAT ARE THE CORE ELEMENTS OF EMOTION AND WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THEM AND BEFORE WE CLOSE UP TO DAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH IHAVE MENTION SOME TOOLS I TALKED ABOUT THE THE MOODMETER AP I TALKED ABOUT UM OXYTOSEN AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT IMPACTOXYTOSEN TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CONCONCEPTIALIZED EMOTIONS THIS BUSINESS OF HOW YOU CONCEPTIALIZED EMOTIONS IS REALLY THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL YOU CAN EVER HAVE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING IND REGULATING YOUR EMOTIONAL STATE IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TRY AND WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND IT I REALIZE ITS NOT THE SIMPLEST THING TO DO BUT RATHERTHAN THINK OF EMOTIONS AS JUST THESE LABELS HAPPY SAD AWE DEPRESSED THINKING THEM THINKING ABOUT EMOTIONS EXCUSE ME AS ELEMENTS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT INCOMPASS LEVELS OF ALERTNESS THAT INCLUDE A DYNAMIC WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND YOUR PERCEPTION OF YOUR INTERNAL STATE AND STARING TO REALLY THINK ABOUT EMOTIONS IN A STRUCTURED WAY CAN NOT ONLY ALLIW YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE PATHOLOGY OF WHEN YOU KNA YOU MIGHT FEEL DEPRESSED OR ANXIOUS OR OTHERS ARE DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS BUT ALSO TO DEVELOP A RICHER EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE TO ANYTHING NOW OF COURSE I DON'T EXPECT THAT AS YOUR OUT THERE INTERACTING WITH FRIENDS IN YOUR WATCHING T V AND EXPERIENCING LIFE THAT YOU SHOULD BE PARCING EVERY BIT OF OF YOUR EXPERIENCE IN  SOME SORT OF REDUCTIONIST IND MECHANISTIC WAY THAT'S NOT THE GOL HERE BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THEI R PRACTITIONERS TEACHERS OF ANY KIND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE KIDS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR EMOTIONAL LIFE IN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS DHERE I SAY THE WORD REALLY CONSISTS OF I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE WELL SUPPORTED BY THE SCIENCE ACROSS A VARIETY OF RESEARCHERS DOING TO YOU THINGS FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND SOME OF WHOM AGREE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN SOME OF WHOM DON'T SO I OFFER IT TO YOU AS A AS A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE FROM WHICH YOU CAN START TO THINK ABOUT YOUR EMOTIONAL LIFE DIFFERENTLY I HOPE AS WELL AS OTHERS IN A WAY THAT BUILDS MORE RICHNESS IN TO THAT EXPERIENCE NOT THAT DETRACTS FROM IT ONE LASTPOINT AS IT RELATES TO THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE ASKED ME ABOUT PSYCHODELIC THERAPIES THAT ARE NOW EMERGING THINGS LIKE SYLICIVAN AND MDI MAY WE ARE OF COURSE GOING TO DIVE IN TO THAT TOPIC DEEPLY WE HAVE AN EXPERT GUEST COMING ON TO DISCUSS THAT TOPIC THOSE COMPOUNDS CLEARLY EFFECT THE ASPECTS OF EMOTIONALITY THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY CALMNESS ALERTNESS VAILANCE GOOD OR BAD INTERECEPTIVE EXTERECEPTIVE POSITION AND SO RATHER THAN JUST DO A KIND OF CURSORY EXPLORATION OF THOSE COMPOUNDS AND WHAT THE THERAPUTIC AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IS THINKING ABOUT THEM AND HOW THEY FUNCTION I THING IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO INBED THAT FRAMEWORK IN AUR THINKING SO THAT WHEN WE ADDRESS PSYCHODELICS WHEN WE ADDRESS OTHER SORTS OF THERBES COGNIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMOTIVE THERAPES THAT RELATE TO INDIVIDUALS AND COUPLES ET CETERA THAT WE ARE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THEM WITH SOME SORT OF STRUCTURE AND RIGOR RATHER THAN JUST TALK ABOUT THEM AS A BUNCH OF CHEMICALS THAT PRODUCE THESE AMAZING EXPERIENCES THAT PEOPLE NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE TRUTH IT SEEMS THAT PSYCHODELICS SEEM TO PROMOTE ACTIVITY OF STORY TELLING ABOUT PSYCHODELIC EXPERIENCE BUT THAT ITSELF IS NOT REALLY WHAT THE THERAPUTIC COMMUNITY AND THE ACADEMIC AND A COMMUSE ARE INTERESTED IN THEIRE INTERESTED IN TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSAL TRUTHS THE UNIVERSAL BIOLOGICAL SHIFTS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SHIFTS THAT OCCUR IN THE CLENICAL USE OF THOSE COMPOUNDS AND SO WE'RE GAN TA HOLD OFF FOR NOW BUT WE WILL GET TO THEM ONCE AGAIN WE'VE COVERED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MATERIAL TO DAY S REALLY THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO IF NOT THREE UNIVERSITY LECTURES IN ONE PODCAST EPISODE I WANT TO THANK THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE SUPPORTED THE PODCAST AND POINT TO WAYS IN WHICH ALL OF YOU CAN SUPPORT THE

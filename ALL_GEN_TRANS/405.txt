WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPPONCANC DISCU SCIENCE SCIENCE PAY TO  FR LIFE I MANE YOUR HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEURBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR NOM SOBLE DOCTOR NOM SOBELL IS A PROFESSOR OF NEURBIOLOGY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF BRAIN SCIENCES AT THE WISEMEN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE HIS LABORATORY STUDIES ALL FACTION AND KIMO SENSATION ALL FACTION IS OF COURSE OUR SENSE OF SMELL KHIMO SENSATION IS OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CHEMICALS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT TODAY YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN SOME ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE FACTS ABOUT HOW YOU INTERACT WITH THE WORLD IN OTHER PEOPLE AROUND YOU FOR INSTANCE YOU WILL LEARN THAT HUMANS CAN SMELL THINGS AROUND THEM AS WELL AS DOGS CAN IN FACT HUMANS ARE INCREDIBLY GOOD AT SENSING THE CHEMICAL WORLD AROUND THEM YOU ALSO LEARN FOR INSTANCE THAT EVERY TIME YOU MEET SOMEBODY YOU ARE TAKING CHEMICALS FROM THAT PERSON EITHER FROM THE CHEMICAL CLOUD THAT SURROUNDS THEM OR DIRECTLY FROM THE SURFACE OF THEIR BODY AND YOU ARE ACTUALLY APPLYING IT TO YOUR OWN BODY AND YOU ARE PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PERSON'S CHEMICALS TO DETERMIN MANY THINGS ABOUT THEM INCLUDING HOW STRESS THEY ARE THEIR HORMONE LEVELS THINGS THAT OPERATED A SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL ON YOUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT IMPACT YOUR EMOTIONS YOUR DECISION MAKING AND WHO YOU CHOOSE TO RELATE TO OR NOT TO RELATE TO YOU WILL ALSO LEARN THAT TEARS YES THE TEARS OF OTHERS ARE IMPACTING YOUR HORMONE LEVELS IN POWERFUL WAYS YOU WILL ALSO LEARN THAT EVERY SO OFTEN ACTUALLY ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE THERE IS AN ALTERNATION OF EASE THROUGH WHICH YOU CAN BREATHE THROUGH ONE NOSTRIL OR THE OTHER AND THAT ALTERNATION REFLECTS AND UNDERLYING DYNAMIC OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HAS A LOT TO DO WITH HOW ALERT OR SLEEPY YOU HAPPEN TO BE THE LIST OF THINGS THAT DOCTOR NOM SOBELL'S LABORATORY IS DISCOVERED THAT RELATE TO EVERYDAY LIFE AND THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU SAY WOW I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HAPP NS BUT THEN GO OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD AND ACTUALLY OBSERVE THAT THAT HAPPENS IN WAYS THAT ARE INCREDIBLY INTERESTING JUST GOS ON AND ON IN FACT HIS LABORATORY DISCOVERED THAT WE ARE ALWAYS SENSING OUR OWN ODORS THAT'S RIGHT EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE YOUR OWN SMELL YOU ARE ALWAYS SENSING YOUR OWN ODOR CLOUD AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY YOU PERIODICALLY SMELL YOURSELF DELIBERATELEY YOU VEN THOUG YOU MIGHT NOT REALIZE IT IN ORDER TO CHANGE YOUR COGNITION AND BEHAVIOR I FIRST LEARNED OF DOCTOR SOBELL'S LABORATORY THROUGH A RATHER ODD OBSERVANCE THAT OBSERVANCE TOOK PLACE WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT MANY YEARS AGO AT YOU SEE BERKELEY AT THE TIME KNOWN SOBELL WAS A PROFESSOR AT YOU SEE BERKELEY AS I MENTURE BEFORE YOU SINCE MOVED TO THE WISEMEN WELL I WAS WALKING THROUGH THE BERKELEY CAMPUS AND I SAW PEOPLE ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES BUT WITH THEIR HEAD VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND THEIR EYES WERE COVERED THEIR HANDS WERE COVERED THEIR MOUTHS WERE COVERED AND ONLY THEIR NOSE WAS EXPOSED AND WHAT I WAS OBSERVING WAS AN EXPERIMENT BEING CONDUCTED BY THE SOBAL LABORATORY IN WHICH HUMANS WERE FOLLOWING A SCNT TRAIL THAT CEN TRAIL WAS ACTUALLY BURIED SOME DEPTH UNDERNEATH THE EARTH AND YET THEY COULD FOLLOW THAT CENT TRAIL WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF FIDELITY IT WAS FROM THAT EXPERIMENT AND OTHER EXPERIMENTS DONE IN DOCTOR SOBELL' LABORATORY AT BERKELEY AND AT THE WISEMAN INVOLVING NARROW IMAGING AND A NUMBER OF OTHER TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT REVEALED THE INCREDIBLE POWER OF HUMANAL FACTION AND HUMANS ABILITY TO FOLLOW SCENT TRAILS IF THEY NEED TO AND THAT OF COURSE LED TO MANY OTHER IMPORTANT DISCOVERY SOME OF WHICH I ALLUDED TO A FEW MOMENTS AGO BUT YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT MANY MANY OTHER IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES IN THE REALM OF OL FACTION AND CIMO SENSATION THAT HADE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY DOCTOR SOVERAL'S LABORATORY THROUGH THE COURSE OF TO DAY'S EPISODE AND BY THE END OF TODAY'S EPISODE I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL NEVER LOOK AT OR SMELL THE WORLD ROUND YOU THE SAME WAY AGAIN BEFORE WOU BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THA A THEME I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S POT CAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR WSALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANTS ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACKTOLECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDR MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOTCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENT DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR NOME SOBLE DOCTOR SOABLE NO WELCOME THANK YOU MUST SAY I AM EXTREMELY EXCITED FOR THIS CONVERSATION HA'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF YOUR WORK FOR MORE THAN A DECADE OR TO A YES THE KIND OF FRIGHTENING A AND WE OVERLAPPED AT YOU SEE BERGKLY SOME TIME AGO ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT MEAT AND WEME APARTMNAND WE'VE JUST LEARND THAT THE AMAZING APARTMENT THAT YOU MOVED OUT OF WAS THE APARTMENT THAT MY GIRLFR AND I AT THE TIME MOVED INTO IN TWO THOUSANDANDSIX I BELIEVE SO A WE'VE SHARED QUITE A FEW THINGS AR AND TO DAY I LOVE FOR YOU TO SHARE WITH US A ALL ABOUT THE AMAZING LANDSCAPE OF CEMO SENSATION IN PARTICULAR FULL FACTION OR SENSE OF SMEL AND SOME RELATED PERCEPTIOAL ABILITIES OR SUBCONSCIOUS ABILITIES INCLUDING FARIMONDS ET CETERA TO GET EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE I LIKE YOU JO START OFF BY ASKING WHAT ARE THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR ABILITY TO SMELL OBVIOUSLY ERE I LIKE TO THINK IT INVOLVES THE NOSE AT SOME LEVEL IT DOES TO WHAT EXTENT IS THAT MIXED IN WITH OTHER SENSES LIKE TASTE AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT ABOUT THE CHEMICALS THAT WE ARE SENSING THROUGH THIS THING AND FOR THOSE YOU LISTENING OM AND NOT WATCHING I'M TAPPING MY NOSE THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE OF YOU KOW THAT THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE THAT WE'RE INHALING AND A MAKING SENSE OF WITHOUT OUR AWARINESS OWIF YOU COULD JUST OM GIVE US THE TOP CONTOU OUR OR EVEN DEEP CONTERER F YOU LIKE OF THE O THE PARTS LIST AND THE THE VARIOUS ROLES THEY PLAY SO YOU OU'E ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AT ONCE A IN ALL ART WITH THE LITTLE COMMENT ON THE WAY YOU SAID SMELLING THROUGH OUR NEWS WHICH WE DEED DO BUT WE ALSO SMELL THROUGH OUR MALEFACTURALLY THERE'S A PROCESS REFERRED TO HIS RETRONASAL OL FACTION WEARE AM ODERANCE COME UP THROUGH OUR THE BACK OF OUR THROAT AND OUT OF OUR NEWS THE REVERSE WAY AND WE SMELLPINGS THAT WAY AS WELL AN IN FACT A BIG PART OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF ALL FACTION TO FOOD AND TASTE COMES FROM THAT FROM RETRONAZAL AL FACTION BUT A A PRIMARY OL FACTION IS REFERRED TO HIS ORTHONASOL FACTION THAT IS THROUGH OUR NEWS WE SNIFF AND SNIFFING AS A BIG THING WHILE I HAVE A SENSE WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT THAT A LOT TO DAY IN ALL SORTS OF CONTEXTS SO WE SNIFF IN THROUGH OUR NEWS AND TO ANSWER A GENERAL QUESTION OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE SYSTEM AM SO MOLECULES EIRBORNE MOLECULES TRAVEL UP OUR NEWS A DISTANCE IN THE HUMAN OF ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN CENTIMETERS TO ABOUT HERE WHERE THEY INTERACT WITH I WILL YOU USE THE WORD SHEET OF RECEPTERS BUT SHEET IS A BITS S LEADING HERE IT'S NOT A SHEET IT'S VERY CONVOLUTED WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN MILLIONS SUCH RECEPTORS A LINING A STRUCTURE KNOWN AS THE OL FACTORY PETHELIUM THIS IS THE CENSORY SURFACE OF THE O FACTORY SYSTEMS OF FACTORY PETHELIUM AGAIN ABOUT PROBABLY ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN MILLION RECEPTORS IN THE HUMAN IN THE HUMAN PROBABLY OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DIFFERENT KINDS SO THAT'S AMAZING THAT MEANS OA MEANINGFUL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR GENOM IS DEVOTED JUST TO THIS JUST TO THE KINDS OF OLL FACTORY CEPTR SUBTYPES YOU HAVE IN YOUR KNOWS BY THE WAY I CAN SHARE AN AMUSING STORY I WOULD IMAGINE AMUSING STORIES ARE GOOD FOR PODCASTS SO THAT NUMBER OF SIX OR SEVEN MILLION RECEPTORS IT IS PROBABLY NOT VERY WELL GROUNDED ON ITS HEART TO COUNT AH BUT IT'S REASONABLY GROUNDED AND THERE WAS THE THING ROAMING AROUND IN THE LITERATURE ABOUT BLOODHOUNDS HAVING BILLION RECEPTORS HAN OUR KNOWS WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE SO AMAZING AND THIS NUMBER WAS YOU KNOW IT SOT OF PROPAGATED THROUGH THE LITERATURE AND AND OUR LAB A HAS WRITTEN OVER THE YEARS OF FEW REVIEW CHAPTERS AND AND WE WERE REPEATEDLY WRITING THE OLL FACTION CHAPTER FOR VERY LARGE ONE OF THESE LARGE TEXT BOOKS THE GAZANAGA HAND BOOK OF A COGNITIVENORL SIENCE I THINK IT'S CALLED AM AND AND WE HAD THAT IN THERE AS WELL SOMEWHERE AND AND ONE TIME WEN WERE RENEWING THE CHAPTER FOR A NEW VERSION OF THE BOOK I TOLD THE GRADUATES AN WHO AS LEADING THAT AT THE TIME AR IASHURN SHEIS NOW A PROFESSOR IT SAEE UNIVERSITY I TOLD HER CHECK THAT CHECK THAT REFERENCE OUT WHERE IN THE WORLD TAT THAT COME FROM AND WE STARTED GOING BACK AND BACK AND BACT ND IT TURNS OUT IT COMES FROM IT TEXT BOOK AN AUSTRALIAN TEXT BOOK AND WE FOUND THE AUTHOR OF THE TEXT BOOK AND AND WE WROTE HER AND AS IT LOOKED THERE IS THE THING AND IN THE LITERATURE OF A BILLION RECEPTORS IN IN THE BLOODHOUND WHERE DID THAT COME FROM AND AND SURPRISEY SHE ANSWERED ME AND AN I WAS HOPING TO GET A REFERENCE RIGHT BUT IT WASN'NT REFERENCE AND IN THIS WHERE IT REALLY BECOMES FUNNY FOR US BECAUSE SHE SAID I I I WAS ONCE A AT A LECTURE A A AN OLFACTION GENETICISTS GENETISISTS BY THE NAME OF DORON LANDSET A AND HE SAID THAT IN THE LECTURE NOW THIS IS REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE SHE'IS IN AUSTRALIA THIS IS ALL OVER THE WORLD TIS NUMBER AND I'M WRITING HER FROM ISRAEL AND DORON LANCET IS IN THE BUILDING NEXT TO ME OQUET HE ISN'T IN WHITESMEN INSATIGENETICS I MEAN HE USED TO BES HIS RETIRED NOW A AND AND HE HE HAD MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF LL FACTION AM TO I PICKED UP THE INTERNAL PHON AND AND A SID HATER ON YOU KNOW DID YOU SAY THAT THERE IS A BILLION RECEPTORS IN THE BLOODHOUND NERVES AND HE SAID WHAT'S A BLOODHOUND SO THIS IS TOTALLY MADE UP RIGHT IT TORIALY MADE UP AND ITPROPAGATED I MEAN YOU CN YOU CAN PROBABLY GOIN TO GUGEL AND TYPE LIKE ABILLION RECEPTORS IN THE BLOODHOUND AND AND YOU'LL GET A LOT OF HITS BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTY NOETINENCE FOR THAT AMAZING AND NOT JUST AMAZING IN LIGHT OF WHAT IT IT TELLS US ABOUT OL FACTION IN BLOODHOUNDS ARE OTHERWISE BUT AMAZING BECAUSE IT SHEDS LIGHT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF WHAT IS IN TAX BOOKS SCIENCETIFIC AND MEDICAL IS ABSOLUTELY WROL THINGS THINS PROPAGATE AND AND YOU KNOW YOU SIHT YOURSELF AND RIGT SO WE FIXED THAT AND THAT VERSION OF RIT OF THE AND AND SO TO FINISH THE LINE SO THAT SOODERANCE INTERACT WITH THESE RECEPTORS A HERE IN ARIPITHELIUM NOT WHERE THE UNDERGO WHAT IS REFERRED TO HIS TRANSDUCTION THAT IS THE ODERANCE AR DOCATA RECEPTOR AND TURN INTO A NERAL SIGNAL OR FOR IN FORCE THE RECEPTOR RESPOND IN NERAL SIGNAL AND A THIS SNERAL SIGNAL IN FACT ACTION POTENTIALS NOT RADIANT POTENTIALS OF ANY KIND A PROPAGATES A VIOLIAL FACTORY NERVE NOW THIS IS A NERVE THAT GOES FROM OUR PITHELIUM ALL RIGHT HERE BEHIND THE FOREHEAD NO IT'S WELL YA N HERE A THRUGH A THE THINNEST PART OF OUR SKALL AN ERRY REFRGES THE CRUBERFORM PLATE WHICH HAS PERFORATED IT HAS A LOT OF HOLES THE NERVE GOES THROUGH THOSE HOLES AND SYNAPSES AT THE FIRST TARGET IN THE BRAIN A WHICH IS THE OLFACTORY BALB AND HUMANS A THAT FORMS AN INTERESTING A POINT OF SENSITIVITY A BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOSE THEIR SENSE OF SMELL DUE TO TRAMA A BECAUSE OF THAT STRUCTURE A HEAD HIP TYPE TRAMA WELL YES ALTHOUGH A YOU DENOTED HITTING ON THE FRONT OF THE HEAD WHICH IS WHERE ALL THIS REAL ESTATE IS BUT ACTUALLY A THE MORE COMMON CAUSE FOR LOSING YOUR SENSE OF SMELL FOR TRAMA IS THE BACK OF THE HEAD BECAUSE OF WHAT'S REFRGES A CONTRE TO INJURY SO AS YOUR LISTENERS PROBABLY KNOW OUR BRAIN IS FLOATING IN LIQUID AND C ASEF AND SREEBER SPINAL FLUID INSIDE OUR SKULL AND WHEN WE GET HIDDEN THE BACK OF THE HEAD THE BRAIN HAS THIS FORWARD AND BACKWARD MOVEMENT IN THE LIQUID AND IN THE SKULL IT'S SOUT OF CRASHES IT CAN CRASH AGAINST THE FRONT OF THE SKULL WHICH LI YOU ALSO HAVE AN CONTREQUINDERY YOU ALSO OFTEN HAVE FRONTAL DAMAGE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THIS GENERATES A SHEERING MOTION ON THE CRIBFORM PLATE AND THE OLFACTORY NERVE IS SEVERED AND IF IT'S COMPLETELY EVERED IT'S IT'S LOST FOREVER BECAUSE MY UNDERSTAND IS TAT THE OLFACTORY SINCE RE NERANSCAN ARE AMONG THE FEW CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM NERNS IN ADULT HUMANS THAT CAN REGENERATE SO OR REPLENISH THEMSELVES RIGHT SO SELL IL AGAIN THERE A FEW QUESTIONS O GA WES O PIRSTOF AL WE WILL SPEND ANY PLATE SIN WIL TA ITS COMPLETELY SEVERED COMPLETELY THEN YES YOU'RE LOST FOREVER YE IF IT'S COMPLETELY SEVERED BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU'LL HAVE REGENERATION AT THE BASIL SELLA LEVEL AT THE PIFILIUM THEY WON'T MANAGE TO FIND THEIR WAY BACK A TO THE BALB IF IF YOU HAVE PARTIAL OR SOMETHING LEFT OR SOMETHING SHOWS UP IN A SHORT WHILE AFTER THE INJURY THEN YOU HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF RECOVERY O BECAUSE DONT ROW ALONG THE TRAJECTORY OF THE OTHER ACTS ON THAT OR PIONEERING THE WAY FOR THEM ASSUMINGLY HM INTRANTEND SUT SOISCALLY AND AND BASICALLY THE TIME FRAME AND YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY I GET A LOT OF YEMALES ON THIS LL  I'M NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR BUT BUT I GET A LOT OF EMALES FROM PEOPLE WITH LOST THEIR SENSE OF SMELL BECAUSE IT'S VERY DISTRESSING AND NOW MORE PEOPLE NOW THIS BECAUSE OF COVID THAT IT'S VERY DISTRESSING AND AND BASICALLY THE RULE OF THUMB IS THAT IF YOU DON'T GET IT BACK WITHANY YEARTY YEARN A HALF YOU'LL NEVER CO GET IT BACK MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATISTICS ON O FACTORY LOSS IN COVET AN AND AN OTHER VIRAL TYPE INFECTIONS IS THAT AFORS SO I HAD I EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN I GOT COVED INCLUDING TOTAL AND OSMA FOR ONE DAY AND NOT TOTAL IT WAS JUST THERE WAS A REMNANT OF A ABILITY TOTO SMELL WERE SET OR PERCEIVE THE SMELL OF A LEMON AND I WAS HOFFING AS HORD AS I POSSIBLY COULD I ACTUALLY THERE'S AN OVER THE COUNTER REMEDY AND THIS IS NOT A PSEUDO SCIENCE BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF PAPERS PUBLISH ABOUT THIS ONPUBMET THE ALFALAPOIC ACID CAN ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY OF OF A SMELL YE AND  AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT O IT WORKD SUCCESSFULLY FOR ME I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S THE ONLY OR RATHER KNOW IF I WORK SUCCESSFULLY FOR EUROPE YOU WOULDHAVE RECOVERED ANYWAY  YOU DINT THROUGH A CONTROLIT  THAT I AS NO AINIALIES YE THAT THA LEIS SAY TWO THINGS ON THIS FRONT FIRST THE DEEN ON THE ALFULOPOCACID IS YE SA HIIS NOT EY WELL BUT BELUSING YOUR SENSE OF SMELL IS OVERWHELMING EYOU NO NO I KNOW TO IT'SO AND I THINK YO MAY KNOWS ESPERIT  A WORD ABOUT THE SMELLING THE LEMON AND THIS IS A I'LL TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT TA SURE MORE INFORMATION WHEN WE SMELL THINGS IT'S THE RESULT OF MORE A SENSORY SUBSYSTEMS IN THE OLE FACTORY SYSTEM ALONE SO YOU HAVE SEVERAL CUMOSENSORY SENSITIVE NERVES IN YOUR NES A PRIMARY ONE BEYOND THE OLFACTORY NERVE IS THE TRIGENERAL NERVE THE FIFTH CRENIAL NERVE SO THE TRIGEMERAL NERVE HAS SENSORY ENDINGS IN YOUR NOS IN YOUR THROAT AND IN YOUR EYE IT HAS THREE BRANCHES THAT'S WHY AN ONION HAS SMELL AND BURNS YOUR EYES AND BURNS IN YOUR THROAT IS THAT WA TRIGEMERAL YOW THE TEERING OF A CUTTING AN ONYIN IS TRIGEMERAL LL TRIGEMERAL REFLECTS AMAZING WE TALK ABOUT TRIGEMINA ON THE CONTECT OF HEADACHE DURING A HEADACH EPIS ITS A TRIGEMERAL REFLECTS SO THE LEMON YOU WERE SMELLING MAY HAVE BEEN A TRIGEMENAL SENSATION O SMELLING THE LEMION WITH MY EYES AS WHAT YOUR SAIDWHAT NO WITH YOUR NOSE WE LEN I KNO WITH YOUR TRIGEMERAL RECEPTORES 'T NOT YOUR OL FACTOR CEPTORS AM SO INWITHIN YOU KNOW ALL FACTION RESEARCH FOR JARGON A THERE'S WHAT WE REFER TO HIS PURE OL FACTANTS THESE ARE ODERS THAT WILL STIMULATE YOUR OL FACTORY NERVE ALONE THEY WON'T INFLUENCE YOUR TRIGEMERAL NERVE AT ALL AND AN EXAMPLE JUST TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THAT MIGHT BE WOULD BE A A COFFEE RIGHT HERE A IS A PURAL FACTANT A VENILLA IS AN KNOWN PURAL FACT AND THESE THINGS HAVE NO TRIGEMERAL ACTIVATION M AS LONG AS WE'RE ON THIS TOPIC AND WILL WEAVE BACK AND FORTH BUT I'M GLAD WE ARE ON THE TOPIC BECAUSE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE WROTE TO ME DURING THE PANDEMICANS CONTINUE TO ABOUT O FACTORY A LOSS AM IS THE I I'VE HEARD OF THIS OL FACTORY TRAINING WHERE WHEREBY IF YOU HAVE A PARTIAL OR EVEN A COMPLETE LOSS OF A PRIMARYAL FACTION  THAT UM ONE IS ENCOURAGED TO SMELL OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SMELLS A I GROP STUDYING ACTIVITY DEPENDENT WIRING AT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE TO ME WY KEEPING THER ONS ACTIVE KEEPS THEM ALIVE THIS IIS NOT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER TYPE I THING BY THE WAY THAT'S TO QUOTE FROM CARLOR SHATS NON DONALD HEAD FOLKS OR ME BUT THIS IS ABOUT KEEPING NERONS ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE THE SCISLL A FACTORY NEUR ONS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR CONNECTIONS BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY WILL DIE OL FACTION IS A DEFINITE USITOR LOSE IT SYSTEM AND SO THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND INDEED THERE'S VERY STRONG EVIDENCE FOR SUCCESS OF OF A THE TRAINING PORAMS MORE THAN THE ALPHOLOPOIC ACID I AN AND SO THAT'S A REAL THING AND AND WHAT'S COOL ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO GO AND BY EXPENSIVE THINGS ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T F COURSE THEIR PEOPLE WARE CAPITALIZING ON THIS COMMRCIALYE ALREADY BUT YOU CAN JUST TAKE THE FROM YOUR REFREGERATOR OR YOUR OR YOR YOU KNOW MAKE UP CABINET OR WHATEVER AND SMELL THEM YOU KNOW ATTENTIONALLY AND CONSTANTLY AND SNIFF THEM AND AND THAT EXPOSURE WILL HELP YOU RECOVER O THERE'S GOOD DATA ON THAT BI NOW YOU MADE THAT A POINT IN PASSING ABOUT REGENERATION IN THE ORFACTORY SYSTEM AN NEITHER ONE AT ONE OF THE COOL THINGS SISU IN ALL FACTION YOU CAN YOU CAN STUDY MANY THINGS THROUGH AL FACTION INDEED ONE OF THEM IS IS IN IS NUR REGENERATION A BECAUSE THE OLFACTORY NURONS ARE REALLY THE ONLY NURONS THAT DO THAT SYSTEMATICALLY IN THE ADULT MAMELIAN BRAIN AND WHETHER THE HUMAN OL FACTORY SYSTEM SHOWS THE SAME LEVEL OF REGENERATION AS AT DOZN IN A IN OTHER MAMMALS IS AND WAS SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE AND I'M JUST BRINGNG THAT OF TO SHARE REALLY COOL STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NURON I THINK SOMEWHERE ROUND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A WHERE TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION I JUST REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF DOING THAT WHAT THEY WHAT THE AUTHORS DID A WAS LOOK AT IN IN POST MORNAM THEY LOOKED AT LEVELS OF SEAFOURTEEN IN IN ADULTS WERE EXPOSED TO ATOMIC BOM EXPERIMENTS PRIT SO YOU HAVE YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THESE AT THESE NURONS AND AN TIME THEM BESON EXPOSURE TO RADIATION A AND THAT PAPER SUGGESTED THAT THAT THERE'S NOT AS MUCH TURN OVER IN THE HUMAN OLD FACTORY BALB AS THERE IS IN OTHER MAMMALS A OTHER LINES OF DATAS SUGGEST OTHERWISE SO THIS IS KIND OF DEBATED QUESTION AS TO WHAT EXTENTED NURGEN DEGENERATION YOU HAVE IN IN THE HUMAN OL FACTORY SYSTEM IS OPPOSED TO OTHER A A MAMALS BUT BUT THAT WAS JUST REALLY QUEL PAPER I THINK OF DOING THAT FASCINATING A I I TO SHOULD I FINISH THA THE PATH JUST O LE HAVE SO SO WE SAID O TO INFORMATION THEN CYNAPS IS AT THE OLFACTORY BALB FROM FROMON THE HE ALFACTORY PEFILIUM AND THE PATTERN OF THAT SCYNAP SING FOLLOWS WHAT'S REFERRED TO IS THE MOST EXTREME CASE OF CONVERGENCE IN THE MAMILIAN A NERVOUS SYSTEM MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT ALL THE RECEPTORS OF A GIVEN SUB TYPE AND REMEMBERING HUMANS WE SAID WE HAVE ABOUT THRE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN THE MOUSE WE HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND TO HUNDRED PROBABLY A SO ALL THE RECEPTORS OF ONE SUB TYPE CONVERGE TO ONE LOCATION IN THE BALB AND OW THIS LOCATION IS REFERRED TO HIS ICALAMARALISS OR IMPLORAGLAMAROLE AND AND THAT MAY BE A SLIGHT OVER SIMPLIFICATION ITS IN FACT TOOGLAMARALI  THERE IS A MIRROR SORT OF A MIRROR CUT LINE AND SO ALL THE RECEPTRS OF ONE SUB TYPE WILL CONVERGE TO TWO MIRAGLAMERALI ON THE ALFACTORY BALB SO YOU END OP HAVING A TO GLAMERALIE REFLECT THAT ONE RECEPTOR SUBTYPE AND SO IF AND THIS IS IS FAR AS THA I'M GIVING YOU NOW THE TEXT BOOK VIEW OF OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS BUT THEN I CAN ALL HAPPILY SHARE WITH YOU THINGS THAT POSE A PROBLEM FOR THE TEXTBOOK VIEW OF HOW THINGS WORK BUT THE TEXT WE VIEW OF HOWTHING'S WORK IS THAT EVERY SUCH RECEPTOR SUBTYPE IS RESPONSIVE TO A SMALL SUB SET OF DIFFERENT MOLICULAR SHAPES WHAT SOMETIMES REFERRED TO HIS ODOTOPES THE MOLICULAR ASPECTS OF THE ORDERANT SO EACH RECEPTORS IS RESPONSIVE TO A DIFFERENT SUBSET OF ODOTOPES LET SAY TEN AND EACH ODOTOPE WILL ACTIVATE A DIFFERENT SUBSET OF RECEPTORS SO POTENTIAL YOU HAVE THI INSANE COMMON ENTORICS OF THIS POTENTIALLY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DIMENTIONAL SPACE IN THE HUMAN POTENTIALLY BUT THEN BECAUSE OF THIS CONVERGENCE YOU WEND UP HAVING ON THE BALB IN A WAY A MAP REFLECTING  RECEPTOR IDENTITY SO SO LET SEE THIS COFFEE A ACTIVATES RECEPTERS OF TYPE ONE THREE AND SEVEN SO THE GLMERALI OF RECEPTRS ONE THREE AND SEVEN WILL LIGHT UP QUOTUN QUOTE WHEN I SMELL THE COFFEE AND IF YOU CUL TAKE A SNAPHOT OF THAT THEORETICALLY WOULD HAVE THE MAP OF OF COFFEE AN ENSONE ANDSO FORTH THIS THIS IS ON OF THE TECTS WHICH VIE OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND AND THEN INFORMATION GOES FROM THE BALB TO SEVERAL TARGETS IN THE BRAIN I MEAN WHAT IS FUR TOS PRIMARY FACTORY QUARTEXIS PURIFORM QUARTEX AND AN INTHERINAL QUARTEXS THIS IS ON THE VENTAL SURFACE OF THE BRAIN THE LOWER PORTION OF OUR TEMPORAL LOBE A AN INFORMATION GOES THERE DIRECTLY BUT IT ALSO GOES DIRECTLY TO TEMING DELA IT PROBABLY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE IPPOTHOLEMIS IT MAY GO DIRECTLY TO THE HERABELLUM IT GOES ALL OVER THE BRAIN SO SOIN FRENCHMENT PROJECTS WIDELY FROM THERE AND AS FAR AS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE MAP THAT MAY EXIST ON THE BALB A DOESN'T EXIST IN THE REST OF THE BRAIN AND THEUNDERSTANDING OF OF HOWL COODING OCCURS IN THE REST OF THE BRAIN AS IS MURKY COMMONLY ONE HEARS THAT THE MEMORIES THAT WE HAVE OF ODORS ARE SOMEHOW MORE ROBUST A THAN THE MEMORIES OF OTHER PERCEPTIOAL EVENTS IN OUR LIFE I I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT BUT ONPEOPLE WILL SAY FOR INSTANCE I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE SMELL OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S HANDS OR THE SMELL OF COOKIES IN HER KITCHEN ATA MINIMUM IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT SMELL AND MEMORY ARE CLOSELY LINKED AND YOU JUST MENTIOND A DIRECT A IN A MULTI STATION BUT NONE THE LESS SOMEWHAT DIRECT PATH FROM THE NOSTRILS TO THE HIPPOCAMPUS A ONE OF THE PRIMARY AN COTING CENTERS OF JTOS EN AMS OF THE WAY THE OTOUCH IS IT WHICH IS A REMARKABLY SHORT PATHWAY CONSIDERING THAT FOR INSTANCE I JUST BY EXAMPLE TOS A SOME OF OUR LISTENERS AR WON'T BE FAMILIAR WITH US BUT SOME WILL THAT SOUND WAVES THAT A UNOR TRANSDUCED INTO NARAL SIGNALS AT THE LEVEL OF THE INNER EAR GO THROUGH MANY STATIONS BEFORE THEY ARRIVE AT THE LOCATION IN THE BRAINWEAR WE MAKE SENSE OF THOSE SOUNDWAYS AS VOICES OR MUSIC ET CETERA WHEREAS OL FACTION IS A MORE OF A DIRECT ROUTE AM TO THE TO THE A MEMORY CENTERS AM IS THERE ANY A JUST SO STORY OR REAL A OBJECTIVE TRUTH TO THE IDEA THAT OLL FACTORY MEMORIES ARE FORMED MORE EASILY OR MAINTAINED LONGER OR MORE ROBUSTLY THAN OTHER SORTS OF MEMORIES SO SO YES A BUT FIRST SIGHT I SHOULD I SHOULD SAY THAT I'M NOT AN AUTHORITY ON ALL FACTORY MEMORY IT'S SOTOM IT IFACT REMEMBERIES A HUGE FIELD RESEARCH AND SOMEHOW OUR LAB HAS NEVER REALLY A GONE MUCH INTO THAT ALTHOUGH AGAIN THE SAME SUNET I HAPPEN TO TALK ABOUT BEFORE THE OUR EYESHRUN WHOSE GAN NOWA A FACULTY IT SELL OF EVE AH AM RAN A STUDY A PAPER WE THINK WE PUBLISHIN CARNBILY BIOLOGY CALLED THE PRIVILEGE REPRESENTATION OF EARLY OL FACTOR IS A ASSOCIATIONS BASICALLY THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIRST TIME YOU EXPERIENCE A SMELL THE GENERATES A PARTICULARLY ROBUST REPRESENTATION MORE THAN OTHER CENSURY STIMULI AND AND THAT'S WHAT SHE IN FACT COMPARED SO THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIRST EXPOSURE TI SMELL AM IN TERMS OF THE BRAIN INCOUDING THAT THAT ETCHES IT INTO OUR A BEING AND AND THIS IS AN EFFECT THAT HAS YOU KNOW IT HAS ECHOES OF COURSE IN LITERATURE I MEAN YN O THA THE THE BIGGESTLY CHANE THIS IS TO BRING UP THE PRUST EFFECT RIGHT SO THE PRUSE EFFECT IS WHEN HE ATE THE MADALIN AND IN IMMEDIATELY THE TASTE AND SMELL IMMEDIATELY REMINDED HIM AH OF OF AN EVENT IN HIS CHILDHOOD WERE IT WEREA WERE THE SAME MADLINE A APPEARED AH AM BUT BUT SO THAT SOMETHING VERY REAL THERE THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH ON IT A NOT COMING FROM OUR WORKS A I'M NOT AN AUTHORITY BUT ITT DOES SOUND LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT ALL FACTION AM AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ISN'T SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT VISION OR ODITION EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN A UNIQUE AAV THE LAST OUR US IT THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUNM MY STUDENTS MAKE FUN OF ME BECAUSE THE SAME THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO THAT THAT I TRY TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING THROUGH THE ORFACTORY SYSTEM IMEAN FOR ME EVERYTHING IS ALL FACTORY SO SO YES HROUGH THE LENDS OF THE NOSE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLTIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS AN ATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASE CRIPE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AND THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO WHEN I WAS AT BERGLEY AM I WAS WALKING ACROSS CAMPUS ONE DAY AND I SAW I THINK STUDENTS BUT I SAW PEOPLE ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES WITH GOGGLES ON GLOVES ON AND AM I THINK THEIR MOUTHS WERE COVERED TO AONY WAS COVERED WAS COVERED AND THEY WERE WALKING WHILE THEY WERE CRAWLING ALONG THE GROUND AM AND I THOUGH THIS WAS PECULIAR BUT THEN AGAIN  ITS YOU SEE BERKLEY AND THE JOKE IS A IT TO GET NOTICED ON THE USEE BERKLY CAMP AS YOU OGHT TO BE NAKED AND ON FIRE I ONE OF THE OTHER WOULD NOT BE EFFICIENT PLEASE ONT ONIS EXPAI OLACE UM E BUT NONE THE LESS  A PAPER CAME OUT OF A FEW YEARS LATER DESCRIBING THE RESULTS OF WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE YOUR EXPERIMENT THAT YOUR LABORATORY WAS RUNNING WHICH WAS HAVING PEOPLE FOLLOW AN ODOUR TRAIL WITH THEIR NOSE AND U AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PEOPLE CAN IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO TRACT SENSE QUITE ROBUSTLY ESPECIALLY IF WE DEPRIVE THEM A VISION AND SOME AT A SENSATION THAT IS TOUCH AND SOME OTHER IM SENSATIONS MAY BE COULD JUST TELL US A LOWLBIT ABOUT THAT STUDY AND FROM M FOR I THINK IN OUR AUDIENCE I'M SUSPECTING THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE A KEEN KEEN SENSE OF SMELL VERY S I OVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHOCH IS LIKE DETECT ANY NEGATIVE IN PUTRID ORDER IN THE ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO GOOD ODORS IM EXQUISITELY WELL NIGH I HAVE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHOSE SENSE OF SMELL IS QUITE POOR UM ID LOVE FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE TO LEARN A BIT ABOUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF TRAINING UP OR IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO SMELL AND AMIT PERHAPS IN THE CONTECTS OF THAT STUDY IF YOU WILL YES SO SOFRIST BEFORE WE'VE BEN TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING JUST OFF THE BAT HUMANS HAVE A REMARKABLE SENSE OF SMELL AND THIS IS SOMETHING AGAIN IN OUR LIBEWY ARERADY SUMINO GAW WE KNOW THIS THIS IS ONL NEWS BUT BUT TO PEOPLE COME FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS WE HAVE TO REITERATE THIS SOMETIMES WHEN I GIVE YOU KNOW PUBLIC LECTURERS TO TO NOMINAL FACTION AUDIENCES I REITERATE THIS HUMANS HAVE AN UTTERLY REMARKABLE SENSE OF SMELL TO TO PUT THAT A BIT INTO SUT OF YOU KNOW THINKS THAT YOU COULD THERE ARE TANGIBLE TO TO FOR EXAMPLE IM MERCAPTAINS WHICH ARE ADDED TO COOKING GAS THAT WE SMELL IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WOELDN'T HAVE A SMELL SO THAT THE SMELL OF GA S DOS NOT THE SMELL OF GAS OF PROPANCE AN ADDED TO WERECAPTAIN YAC ITS MER CAPTAIN THI ALIVER LAYAO SO SO OUR DETECTION THRESHOLD THAT IS THE LEVEL AT WHICH WE CAN DETECT IT IS ZERO POINT TO PARTS PERBILION AH THERE'S NO MACHINE T AT CAN REALLY DO THAT THAT EFFECTIVELY NO GASCROMATOGRAPH NOTHING NOW TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER SENSE O A MAKING THIS AGAIN REALLY TANGIBLE WE'RE WORKING WITH A NOTERANT IN OUR LAB CALLED ESTRATETRA ENALL THAT OUR PARTICIPANTS CAN DETECT WHEN WE HAVE IT MIXED AT TEN TO THE NEGATIVE TWELVE MOLAR IN LIQUID PHASE TO GIVE YOU A REAL SENSE OF THAT WE DID THE MAT IF YOU WOULD TAKE TO OLYMPIC SIZED SWIMMING POOLS AND YOU WOULD PIPE IT ONE AMOUNT ONE DROP INTO ONE POOL VERSES THE OTHER YOU COULD SMELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POOLS INCREDIRAL THAT'S THE DETECTION THRESHOLD YOU HAVE WITH YOUR NOSE PEOPLE HAVE ANUTTERLY AMAZING NOSE OKAY SO SO THAT'S JUST IN TERMS OF ITS DETECTIONABILITIES WHICH AR ARE JUST IN A REMARKABLE REALLY UP THERE IN THE MAMALIAN WORLD WER NOT A BAD MAMEL AN ALL FACTION AM AND AND BEYOND THAT WE CAN WE CAN IMPROVE OKAY AND AND EXAMPLE YOUARE TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY STARTED OFF AH IS A LAB BET OGAY WE WERE HAVING A LAB PICNIC SO I GUESS I SHOULD HEAR PILIN BECAUSE AM AM YOUR GUEST FROM THE WITESMAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE IN ISRAEL BUT BEFORE GOING BACK TO MY HOME IN ISRAEL I WAS A A AM FACULTY T YOU SEE BERKLEY IN TH HELLENWOLE'S NERROW SCIENCE INSTITUTE AND THIS STUDY WAS DONE DURING THAT TIME AND WE WERE ON A LAD PICNIC AND WE WERE HAVING INDEED ONE OF THESE SORT OF LAB DISCUSSIONS ARGUMENTS ON WHAT HUMANS CANNON CANDO WITH OUR SENSE OF SMELL AND AND I SAID THAT HUMANS COUL TRUL EVEN TRACK ODOR LIKE A DOG AND PEOPLE THERE SAID NO WAY AND WE RAN THIS QUICK EXPERIMENT AT WHICH AVIDIO OF BUT I DON'T THINK WE'LL SHOW IT HERE AH BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE A RIDLE THE PICNIC VIDIO WE HAVE IT AND  A A GRADUTON BY THE CRISTINA SALANA A BRILLIANT GRADUATESONS AT THAT TIME WHO'S NOW SHE'S NOW A PROFESSOR AT NORTHWESTERN AN SHE'S REALLY LEADING THE FIELD OF AVOLLFACHION IMAGING TO DAY BUT SHE WAS THE VOLUNTEER AND WE DRAGGED A CHOCOLATE BAR ACROSS THE GRASS AND BLINDFOLDED HER AND CHECKED IF SHE COULD TRACK THE TRACK WE MADE WITH THE CHOCOLATE WHICH SHE DID VERY EFFECTIVELY RIGHT AND SE AS LACER AT THE STARTING POINT OF THE LINE OR I THINK WE DID I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID ON THAT SORT OF PICNICA A TRIAL BUT YOU KNOW I I ASSUME SHE NEVER PRACTISED THAT IN HER LIFE BEFORE IHT AND YET YOU KNOW SHE SHE DID IT REALLY REALLY WELL AND AND THEN THIS WENT ON AS THE LABBET IN WAY THAT THI I SAID TO MY METENSIY WE WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS INTO AN EXPERIMENT PUT IN EXPERIMENTAL SETTING AND AND AND QUANTIFY WHAT'S GOING ON A AND THEY ALL SAID A IT WOULD BE UNINTERESTING THAT WAS THE BED AND AND I TOLD THEM IT WOULD BE IN NATURE WHICH IS A BET I WON IN THIS CASE ATUR MUS AING ONE OF THEAP THREE AN ANAL  O A WAS A WS ATENERAL SIENCE TO  HER BUT BUT A SO SO THEN WE TURNED IT INTO AN EXPERIMENT AND AND WHAT THE EXPERIMENT WAS IS THAT WE BROUGHT IN PARTICIPANCE NAIVE PARTS IPANCE NO NOT GRADULICONCS FROM OUR LAB A COMPLETELY DEPRIVED THEM OF ANY OTHER CENSURY AND PUT SO WE BLOCKED OUR EYES WE BLOCKED OUR EARS WE BLOCKED EVERYTHING WE BLOCKED WIT THEY WERE WEARING HEAVY GLOVES A YOU KNOW THE THEY CONSENT ANYTHING AND WE GENERATED A AA A CONSISTENT ODOR PASSED IN THE GRASS WHICH IS WHAT YOU SAW AH WE DID THAT BY BURYING TWINE UNDER THE GRASS AND AN ODORIN PREGNATED TWINE SO THAT WAY WE COULD GENERATE A CONSISTENT A ODOR TRAIL EVERY TIME WAS IT AND AT THE BASE OF THE GRASS OR IN THE DIRT IT WAS BURIED IT WAS BURIED UNDER THE GRASS REALLY YE YE WHILE AND DID NOT IT WAS BURIED UNDER THE GRASS AND WE A CONDUCTED AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND A PARTISPANCE ALSO HAD THE CENSE OR PACK THAT THEY WERE WEARING WHERE WE A MEASURED NASAL AIRFLOW IN EACH NOSTRIL IN REAL TIME AND A THEY OUGHT WE ALSO USE SOMETHING CALLED ART K G P S WHICH IS AWAY TO LAY A RADIAL FREQUENCY GRATED OVER THE G P S GRID SO THAT YOU HAVE MILIMETE RESOLUTION AND SPACE PACICALLY AM IT'S USED BY SURVEYORS MOSTLY AM SO THAT WE COULD TRACK BEHAVIOR AND WE FOUND A FEW THINGS DOING THIS ONE IS THAT PEOPLE COULD JUST DO THIS RIGHT OFF THE BACK AM THE SECOND THING WE FOUND THAT IS WHEN WE TRAINED THEM UP THEN WITHIN A AVERAGE OF FOUR DAYS A THE RAT LIMITING FACTOR WECAME THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY COULD CRAWL SO AS FAST AS YOU COULD CRAWL YOU COULD CENT TRAC OF COURSE YOU CAN'T CAL AS FAST AS AE DOG CAN RUN BUT YOU AS FAST AS YOU CAN CRAWL YOU CAN CENT TRACK AND THEN TO TO SORT OF ADD WHAT MADE IT REALLY INTERESTING FROM FROM A A SYSTEMS NORSTINES PERSPECTIVE IS THAT WE ASKED WHETHER HAVING TWO NOSTRILS A CONTRIBUTES TO THIS SO A WE BUILT WE CONSTRUCTED A ANNASAL PROSTSS IF H WILL A THAT HAD TWO VERSIONS ONE IS THAT T IT COMBINED BOTH NOSTRILS INTO ONE BIG NOSTRIL CENTERED AND THE OTHERS THAT IT IT MAINTAINED TO SEPARATED A NOSTRILS AND WE COMPARED PERFORMANCE UNDER THESE TWO CONDITIONS AND PEOPLE PERFORMED BETTER A WITH TWO NOSTRILS OVER ONE CENTRALIZED NOSTRIL TITGH THE FLOW REMAIN THE SAME SO YOUR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE INFORMATION  THE COMES FROM YOUR TWO SEPARATE TOTALLY SEPARATE NOSTRILS BY THE WAY THE SYSTEM I DESCRIBE BEFORE OF YOUR EBITILIUM AN BALB AND AN CONNECTION OT QUERTICS A YOU HAVE TWO OF THOSE RIGHT IT'S COMPLETELY UNI LATERAL WELL ALMOST COMPLETELY UNHEDERALE SYSTEM THERE'S SOMEVERY SMALL EXCEPTIONS TO THAT BUT BAT'S O REPRESENTATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN MUCH IN THE SAME WAY WE HAVE TWO EYES WERE NOT A CYCLOPS WE CAN GAIN DEPTH RECEPTION INFORMATION WE CAN PERCEIVE MOTION BETTER AS A CONSEQUENCE AND AND A NUMBER OF ADEPTH ESPECIALLY STERY OPSIS AND CAN LOCATE SOUND BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR EARS AND HOW HAD BLOCKS THEM BETWEEN EMIS I A ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE THE MECHANICS AND STRATEGIES THAT YOU OBSERVED BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S INFORMATION ABOUT THE SYSTEM THE BRAIN AS A CONSEQUENCE AM WERE YOU IN A POSITION TO MEASURE SNIFFING FREQUENCY AND THE SPECIFIC QUESTION I HAVE AS WERE PEOPLE DOING SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF A QUICKSNIFFING OR A I A YOUNO LONG A MADROLL IN ZUINHILL YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T SO WE GUESS WE WERE MEASURING SNIFFING AND RECORNING IT AND AND WE HAVE ALL THE DATA AM THERE WAS NOTHING AM VERY REMARKABLE IN THAT DATA IN THAT STUDY ALTHOUGH IT MAY REFLECT THAT WE DIDN'T ANALYZE IT CAREFULLY ENOUGH AS WELL I MEAN IT DIDNT IT WAS IT IT WASN'T A MAJOR COMPONENT OF OUR ANALYSIS SOLA WE DID LOOK AT IT A TO SOME EXTENT AGAIN YER YOUR ASKING ABOUT A PAPER FROM QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO SI I MAY BE FORGETTING PARTS OF IT AS WELL AM BUT I'M SURE IF IT WAS A OF MAJOR COMPONENT NOUT IT IT WHAT EVER ISN II DEVENT I WASN'T A MAJR FINDING OO THE SNIFFING BEHAVIOR AM IN THE PAPER ALTHOUGH AGAIN WE IN O A SNIFFING BEHAVIOR IS A HUGE PORTION OF OUR OUR LIFE AND LABA A AND AND IT'S IT'S TAKING US TO TO PLACES AND AND IT'S REREEMERGING NOW IN OUR WORK WERE WE'RE DOING TONS OF SNIFFING WORK AM AN I IT CAN SURE WITH YOU SOMETHING THAT THAT I THINK WE'LL INTEREST YOUR YOURA LISTENERS AND PUR IS IS WELL AN AND AN WE THINK IS IS REALLY A A ONE OF THE MOST OVERLOOK THINGS AND INNURE SCIENCE A I LOL WHO VITE YOU I INVIT UE TO THE FALLING EXPERIMENTS SO T INCLUDE ONE NOSTRIL BY PRESSING ON IT FROM THE SIDE AND SNIFF IN AND THEN INCLUDE THE OTHER AND SNIFF IN YOU SENSE A DIFFERENCE IN FLOW YES CADE YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS NO IN IT WAS THE NEXT QUESTION ON MY LIST O DON'T FEEL BADLY ABOUT NOT KNOWING WHY THAT IS A MOST PEOPLE DON'T A BUT THAT IS A REFLECTION OF SOMETHING REFERR TO IS THE NASAL CYCLE SO IN FACT IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT REPEATEDLY YOU WOULD FIND THAT YOUR HIGH FLOW NOSTRIL AND LOW FLOW NOSTRIL ALTERNATE EVERY TWO AND HALF HOURS ON AVERAGE IN AN ABSOLUTE WAYRIS A KIND OF LIKE A SINE WAVE LIKE GRADUAL SHIFT TO THE ONE AND THE GRADUAL SHIFT BACK IT CAN VARY IT CAN VARY AND WE DON'T YET KNOW THE RULES ALL THE RULES BUT BUT YOU HAVE THIS CONSTANT SHIFT FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE SHIFT BECOMES INCREDIBLY PRONOUNCED IN SLEEP SO WE CAN MEASURE THE POWER OF THE DIFFERENCE AND AND IN SLEEP YOU HAVE THE FACE SHIFT OF POWRYOF HA HUGE LIKE ONE CLOSES IN ONE OPENS TOTALLY AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS LINKED TO A BALANCE IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO AS YOUN YOURLISSERS KNOW WE HAVE AN AUTONOMICS NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT HAS A SYMPATHETIC IN PARI SYMPATHETIC COMPONE INTO IT AND AND THEREIN BALANCE OR IMBALANCE IN MANY DISEASES FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE AOUGHT IT BETWEEN THE SYMPATHETIC AND PARI SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DRIVES THE SWITCH FROM LEFT TO RIGHT NOSTRIL JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE ASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS NOTHING DO A SYMPATHY A HAS EVERYTHIN TO DO WITH GENERATING PATTERNS OF ALERTINIST IS SOMETIMES CALL THE FIGHTER FLIGHT SYSTEM BUT ANY EPATTERN OF AROUSAL PAUSIVER NEGATIVE AND THEN IT'S BALANCE IN A CORDINATED WAY OR AT LEAST IN PARALLEL WITH THE PARISYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS SOMETIMES CALL THE REST IN DIGEST SYSTEM BUT IS A ASSOCIATE WITH ALL S ORTS OF THINGS THE SEXUAL ROUSAL RESPONSE  AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR PHYSIOLOGIES SO THINK OF IT LIKE A SEA SAW OF ALERTNESS AND CALM PERFECT SO NOW IMAGINE RIGHT IMAGINE IMAGINE YOU WOULD WALK AROUND LIVING YOUR LIFE RIGHT HALF OF THE TIME WITH ONE EYE CLOSE LIKE THIS AND THE OTHER HALF WITH ONE EYE CLOSED LIKE THIS AND YOU HAVE THIS EYECYCE ALL RIGHT AND THAT WAS LINKED TO AUTONOMIC ROUSAL I ASSURE YOU YOU WOULD GO TO PUTMED THERE WOULD BE FIVE MILLION PAPERS ON THE IYCYCLE RIGHT AND THE ICYCLE AND EVERY DISEASE YOU CAN NAME AND WHAT IT DENOTES AND WHAT IT TELLS US AND WHAT WE CAN DO WITH IT YOU HAVE EXACTLY THIS MARKER YOURE WALKING AROUND THE MARKER ON BALANCE IN YOUR AUTOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND WE DO NOTHING WITH IT SO WEARE IN FACT NOW DOING A LOT WITH IT O CAS WE BUILT WE BUILT A WEARABLE DEVICE THAT I IS PASTED TO YOUR BODY AND MEASURES AIR FLOING EACH NOSTRIL SEPARATELY AND LOGS IT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WERE COLLECTING THESE TWENTY FOUR HOUR RECORDINGS WERE CALLING AT THE NAZAL HALTER SO WE MEASURE WITH THE NAZAL HALTER AND AND WERE FINDING IT IS A DISEASE MARKER IM I CAN I CAN GIVE YOU A NAZAL HALTER MEASUREMENT IS AN ADULT AND I CAN SAY THIS IS WORK BY TMNOSEROKA GRADUATE SONER OR LABNOW I CAN SO WE WE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A A H D AND NONE AD HD ADULTS AND WE CAN TELL JUST FROM THE RECORDING WE CAN TELL IF THE ADULTARNRIDDLEING OR NOT SO I CAN I CAN MEASURE YOUR NASL AIR FLUENCE  IF YOU ARE OR NOT WITH AD H DN IF YOU ARE OR NON UNRIDDLING INCREDIBLE 'VE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS IS IT THE CASE THAT EIR FLOW THROUGH ONE NOSTRIL IS REFLECTIVE OF A SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DOMINANCE VERSES PARI SYMPATHETIC SOM OR IS IT SIMPLY THE CASE THAT THIS ALTERNATING LEFT RIGHT NOSTRIL UNPERIODICITY ON WHICH YOU SAID I THINK IS ON THE ORDER OF ABOUT EVERY TWO HOURS DO AND HALF TWO AND A HALF ITS WHICH IS TO A MAX MLE ON ONE SIDE VERSES THE OTHER IS THAT SIMPLY REFLECTIVE OF AN OVER ALL BOUNCY LET LET'S NAY IS IT THE HINGINTESS HE SAW OR IS AT THE TILT OF TO SEA SO SO I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER I MEAN EN I I CAL GIVE YOU SOME OF A AND I COULD SAY TO SOME EXTENT A RIGHT NOSTRIL MORE OPEN IM IS MORE SYMPATHETIC AND LEFT NOSTRIL MORE OPEN IS MORE PARA SYMPATHETIC BUT THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE VERY CORRECT I MEAIN'T YOU KNOW IT  HERE THAT IT IT AS A YOGY URGON O BE ALL OVER THE SORAY AS I HAD TO STRUCK MY LAT DOS ERSEMSELF ON ON ANYTHING AND THAT THE YOGS ARE ALWAYS SAYING LOKAT YOU NON BECAUSE THERE'S THIS THING I DON'T DO YOGA ANY MORE ABUT NOT FOR ANY POWAN IAMA THAT IM WHERE THEY'LL HAVE YOU BREATH THROUGH ONE NOSTRIL OR THE OTHER AND I I PROBABLEVEN ASKED THIS QUESTION ON SOCIAL MEDIA TEN THOUS   TIME ARE YOU I'VE GO TO BECOME PUBLIC ANY RENUMBER ONE OF THE YOGIES RIGHT NOW SO IS A RE SORI WE THEY'LL COME ANGRY WITH A YOGA HATS WHICH ARE NOT VERY DANGER WE REALLY SO SINCE WE'RE SO INTERESTED IN THIS MECHANISM ONE OF THESE REALLY LIKE TO KNOW HOW TO DO IS IS TO GAIN CONTROL OF IT SOMEHOW AND THERE'S THIS WORLD OUT THEIRE OF YOGA WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE CONTROL OVER THIS SO WE SAID OKET LET'S BRING LIKE REALLY SERIOUS YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND SEE IF THEY CAN SHIFT THEIR NASAL CYCLE FROM LEFT TO WRITE BUT BY WILL ALONE RIGHT NOT BY MANIPULATING THEMSELVES SOMEHOW AND AND IF YOESTIN  WILL LEARN FROM THEM HOW THEY DO THIS AND THEN WE MIGHT E NO USE US TO TO CURATE G DEER OR WHAT NOT RIGHT SO SO WE BOASTED LIKE ON ALL THE LISTS LIKE THE YOGA TEACHERS AND HAVE THIS PARADE OF YOGA TEACHERS WALKING IN TO OUR LAB THIS WAS ONE OF THE STRANGE LOT OF AN OED O ODERS AND TERF  RIT WIT A CLUTHING N AN SO ON AND AND SO WE WE STUDY I ACTUALLY NO WE STUDIED FOURTEEN YOGA TEACHERS ALL FOURTEEN A BY YOU BY THE CONDITIONS OF ENLISTMENT FROR THIS A CAME IN SAYING THAT THEY THEY CA CONTROL SHIFTING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT A NOSTRIL WITHOUT PLUGGING A OSIE I A MA BY THE POWER OF THOUGHT LON M AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF FOURTEEN SUCCEEDED ZERO INCLUDING INCLUDING ONE INO T AS EXTREME ONDERS WET WE HAVE THIS GUY WHOWEWYO KNOW AND WE'RE RECORDING AND WE WE NODERED CORTIS REALLY WELL RIGHT AND AND HE'S SEDING E SING YAMS WITCHING NOW AND A ITWITCHING AND YOU KNOW YOU'R LOOKING AT THE MODER AND NO IT'S NS WITCH AND AND SO NO NO YOGA TEACHER THAT WE FOUND A COULD A WILFULLY SWITCH I BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT NOSTRIL FLOW AND YET THEY'RE THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE AND HAVE TO IMAGINE THE'RE NOT TRYING TO YOU KNOW THERES THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO LIE RIGHT NE NO EVEN OPPOSITE I MEAN ONA THIS PUTS THEM IN AN AWKWARD POSITION ONCE THE AY I DON'T KNO WHAT THE DEAL IS BUT BUT NONE OF THEM CAN DO IT AM GIVEN THAT THE ALTERNATING FLOW THROUGH ONE OR THE OTHER NOSTRILS REFLECTIVE OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS IS TO AND HALF HOUR PERIODICITY IF I SUDDENLY ENTER A BOUT OF STRASS FOR INSTANCE DOES IT SWITCH BECAUSE THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE AUTONOMNERVS I YT AT LEAST I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION IS NOT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY IMPORTANT AS IT RELATES TO STRESS BUT I'M TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSALITY IN OTHER WORDS IS THE AS ARET UNA LATERAL SMELLING THROUGH A UNALATERAL NOSTRIL SMELLING PERIODICITY THAT WHEN WE NAMED IT I COULD THING OF THE WRONG THING I'M SURE IS THAT DRIVING THE SHIFT IN AUTONOMENER SYSTEM OR IS IT MERELY REFLECTIVE OF THIS THE SHIFF SO YOU'VE YOU'VE VERY CONCISELY NOW WORDED AIM TO OF A GRANTS THAT WAS PROBABLY JUST REJECTED BUT BUT BASICALLY WE'RE TRINA ANSWER EXACTLY A THAT QUESTION AND WE'RE CURRENTLY RUNNING EXPERIMENTS ON THAT LINE SO SO WE HAVE ONE EXPERIMENT WERE A I WE'RE LOOKING IM SO WE'RE EXPOSING PARTICIPANCE TO PAIN I WE'RE USING A COLD WATER HAND EXPOSURE IT'S A REALYQUAL PARADINE BECAUSE IT IT THERE'S HUGE INVIDUAL DIFFERENCES WE JUST STARTED THIS WE BUILT THE SET UP JUST NOW AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF MEAT TO WORK WITH THERE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL DIFERENCES HERE E IT'S CAP AT THREE MINUTES O FOR SAFETY REASONS BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE PRETISIPENS PUTTING THEIR HAND IN IN A TWO DEGREE SALTIST WATER BUT TH THEY'LL BE PARTSIPANS WILL PULL IT OUT I LIKE TEN SECONS NINE SECONDS AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE YOU'LL HAVE THREE MINUTES AS WELL SO THERE'S LOTS OF LOTS OF A AND AND ARIDIANTSO NOW I'M SURING PILOT DATA WITH YOU I  I NO TO TO THIS MIGHT  WHEN IT WHEN THIS ANDS OP BEING PUBLISHED IT MIGHT BE THE OPPOSITE BUT SO FAR IT SEEMS THAT THETD HAVE THE EXPOSURE TO COLD GENERATES SHIFT IN THE NAZAL AN ENAZAL BALANCE SO AUTONOMIC ARAUSL CAN DRIVE A SHIFT ATTENTIALLY A EARLIER YOU WERE DESCRIBING THE ARCHITECTURE OF THESE AM SMELLING SYSTEMS AND YOU MENTION THESE GLAMARIALI WAS THEAL FACTOR RECEPTORS CONVERGE RAT IN THE BULB AND THEN LATER YOU MENTION THAT THE SYSTEM IS UNILATERAL BUT WITH A MERROR REPRESENTATION ON BOTH SIDES OF TH BRAIN SO FOR THOSE WHO DON'T THINK IN TERMS A NUR ANATEMY ON WHAT NO ONE WAS DESCRIBING IS THE FACT THAT OF OF COURSE THERE ARE TWO NOSTRILS AND THEN THE BUNCH OF RECEPTORS THAT CONVERSION THESE CLAMERLA BUT YOU HAVE A MERROR REPRESENTATION OF THAT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN AND THAT MOST OF THAT INFORMATION IS KEPT ON ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN OR THE OTHER THERE ISN'T A LOT OF EXTENSIVE INTERMIXING AT THE FIRST ORDER OF CROSSRITIN SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHETHER R NOT YOU BELIEVE I'M NOT ASKING FOR DATA FIRST I JUST ONE TO NW YOU BELIEVE THAT THE  ALTERNATING NOSTRIL AIRFLOW PHENOMENON HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH PREFERENTIAL PROCESSING OF OFACTORY INFORMATION IN TERMS OF RIGHT BRAIN LEFT BRAIN WITH THE CAVIAT THAT ANY TIME WE HEAR RIGHT BRAIN LEFT BRAIN A WE'VE COVERED THIS IN A PREVIOUS APISODE MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE HERE OUT THEREABOUT RIGHT BRAIN LEFT BRAIN EMOTIONALITY LOGICAL STUFF IS COMPLETELY WRONG COMPLETELY WRONG DOESN'T EXIST IS A TOTAL FABRICATION AMEN WE'D LIKE TO ABOLISH THAT MYTH BUT WITH THAT ASIDE FOR ET ASIDE RATHER WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WY THE INFORMATION WHICH SWICH FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN TO THE OTHER AT ALL N I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK THA THAT THE NASAL CYCLE IS AN ALL FACTION STORY IM SO SO I I DON'T THINK THAT IM THAT THIS WAS SHAPED BY THE OLFACTORY SYSTEM NOR DO I THINK THIS HAS MADE YOUR IMPACT ON AL FACTION I THINK THE NASAL CYCHL STORY IS A DIFFERENT STORY ABOUT BRAIN FUNCTION IM SO SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE THE SET OF PET THEORY WHERE CALLING OW THE THE SNIFPING BRAIN APPROACH WHERE WHERE BASICALLY WE THINK THAT THAT NASAL INHALATION IS TIMING AN DRIVING A LOT OF ASPECTS AND PATTERNS OF OF NURAL ACTIVITY AND COGNITIVE PROCESSING AND AND THIS THEORY IT IS IS ALL FACTION INSPIRED IN ITS BEGINNING THAT IS I MEAN IF YIF YOU THINK OF THE MAMALIAN BRAIN RIGHT IT'S WHICH WHICH EVOLVED FROM ALL FACTION IT'S SITTING THERE AND AN INALL FACTION BECAUSE ALLFACTION DEPENDS ON SNIFFING YOU HAVE THIS SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A YOU HAVE A SNIFF YOU HAVE INFORMATION AND THEN FLAT NOTHING RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE INFORMATION AN THEN NOTHING SO INFORMATION PROCESSING IS IS ONE TO ONE LINK TO NASAL INHALATION AND AND WE THINK THAT THAT THIS PROPERTY EVOLVED TO TO BE MEANFUL IN BRAIN PROCESSY IN GENERAL NOT ONLY OF AVOLLFACTORY INFORMATION BUT OF ANY TYPE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE THE BRAIN EVOLVED IN THIS WAY IN THIS WAY THAT IT PROCESSES INFORMATION ON INHALATION ON SET SO A STUDY LED BY ULPHUR PERIL FROM OUR OUR LAB A TWO THREE YEARS AGO A WE LOOK AT IT SOMETHING COMPLETELY NONAL FACTORY WE LOOKED AT AT VISUOU SPACIAL PROCESSING AND WE COMPARED VISUOU SPACIAL PROCESSING ON INHLATION VERSIS EXHELLATION AND THE BRAIN DOES IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ON INHALATION VERSS EXELLATION  YOURE N IN THAT PARTICULAR TASK PEOPLE PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ON INHALATION VERSES EXHELLATION WHAT WAS THE TASK WAS IN AN OLD FACTORY DDON'T KNOW IT'S A VISU SPACIAL TASK SO THIS IS THE ASA WERE WERE THAT THE THE SPECIFICS OF THE TASK WHERE AM THAT YOU SEE A A SHAPE AND YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE IF IT'S A SHAPE THAT CANNOR CANNOT EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD SO SOME OF THEM WERE LIES LIKE USHERSHAPES LIKE  WHERE WERE ONE FASCIT DOSEN REACH THE OTHER FASSIT THESE IMPOSSIBLE FIGURE S  YAYA BUT BUT BUT A STRUCTURAL SHAPES NOT NOT AND AND SO ITO A PURE VISUAL SPACIAL TASK WWE INTENSELY WENT FOR A TASK THAT IS NOT CONSIDERED A VENTURAL TEMPORAL TASK IN AL FACTORY QARTIC TASK IN ANYWAY AND AND PEOPLE PERFORMED MUCH BETTER ON INHALATION VERSIS EXELLATION AT DOING THIS TASK WAS THERE A BOST NOSTRILS ECLUDED AM VERSION WHERE PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO MOUTH BRIETH YES AND IN THIS PARTICULAR TASK THE ALSO DID BETTER ON MOUTH IN HALATION VERSES MOUTH EXHELLATION BUT THE DIFFERENCE WASN'T AS PRONOUNCED AS IT WAS WITH NASAL INHALATION VERSES EXHELLATIONS WITH BAT A YOM A BIG PROPONENT OF NASAL NOT MOUTH BREATHING WHENEVER POSSIBLE OR SURE FOR A MANY HEALTH RELATED REASONS OF A BIG FAN OF THE BOOK JAWS A INEPIDEMIC AOF IN BY COLLIGS O MON AT STANFORIS FAMILIAR WITH IT NAND THIS IDEA THAT A PEOPLE WHO MOUTH BREATHE A EXPERIENCE WERE COLD'S MORE INFECTIONS OF VERIOUS KINDS IT'S NOT GOOD AESTHETICALLY OR FOR THE DENT DENTITURE I NEVER KNOW THE TEETH THE GUMS AID STUFF YES I MY I DENSIISNNICOME AFTERA NEDIO EN TOSA I THE AM THAT NOS BREATHING IS GREAT FOR YOUR HEALTH RELATIVE TO MALSI RESIDE THING ITS ALSO GOOD FOR YOUR COGNITION NOT ONLY FOR YOUR YOUR DENTAL HEALTH I THINK THAT THAT A NEWSBREATHING SHAPES COGNITION AND ANTHAT THERE'RE OTHER LABS A WHO WHO AR A ARE FINDING THE SAME AGAINA A CRISTINOZALANA IS DOING WORK ON THIS LINE SHAPE SHED MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS HERE AND AND A UAN LUNSTRUM IS DOING WORK ON THIS LINE THAT THERE'S LOTS OF STUDIES SUGGESTING THAT AM NAZAL INHALATION IS TIMING COGNITIVE PROCESSING AND AND MODULATING IT E CREDIBLE AM PERHAPS NOT SURPRISING GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE TAUGHT US ABOUT THE OL FACTORY SYSTEM I MEAN THAT THESE TWO HOLES IN THE FRONT OF OUR FACE THESE NOSTRILS I TEAN OTR A PATHWAY TO THE BRAIN THAT I I LOVE TO TELL PEOPLE CAUSE I WORK ON THE VICIAL SYSTEM MY LAB THAT YOW YOUR EYES ARE TWO PIECES OF BRAIN EXTRUDED FROM THE CRANIAL VAULT WHICH THEY ARE THATTHE RATINOS ANY ANYHOW AND AM AND THEN YOU NEVER LOOK AT ANY ONE THE SAME WAY AGAIN AN BUT THE THE AL FACTORY SENSURING ARONS ARE RIGHT THERE AT THE TOPS OF THOSE CAVERNS THAT WE CALL NOSTRILS AND THEY ARE BRAIN YE DEFINITELY IT'S IT'S THE ONLY PLACE HOR YOUR BRAIN MEETS THE OUTSIDE WORLD BECAUSE IN YOUR RETINA THEY'RE PROTECTED BY VIOLENS AND HERE HERE YOU HAVE NURONS IN CONTACT WITH WITH THE WORLD THIS ES ACTUALLY HAS BEEN THE SOURCE FOR SOME THEORIES ON A POTENTIAL A RAT FOR FORNOUR DEGENERATIVE A A MECHANISMS SO AS AS YOU MAY KNOW AM LOSS OF THE SENSE OF SMELL IS ONE OF THE IF NOT THE EARLIEST SIGN OF NEUR DEGENERATIVE DISEASE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE THEREIS A A LOSS IN THE SENSE OF SMELL PROBABLY TEN YEARS BEFORE ANY OTHER SYMPTOM A BUT PEOPLE HAVE FAILED TO MAKE THIS A DIGNOSTIC TOOL BECAUSE IT'S NON SPECIFIC SO IT'S NOT AS IF YOU CO COME TO YOUR DOCTOR AND SAY I'M LOSING MY SENSE OF SMELL AND THEY'LL SAY O EARLY SIGN OF PARKINSONS BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MANY REASONS TO LOSE YOUR SENSE OF SMELL AND AN AND SO ON UM BUT BUT LL FACTORY LOSS AGAIN AS IT IS AN EARLY SIGN OF NER DEGENERATION AND THERE'S AT LEAST ONE THEORY PATICULARLY ABOUT ALTIMERS DISEASE SUGGESTING THAT THAT ALTIMERS MAY BE THE RESULT OF OF A A PASSAGEON THAT ENTERS THE BRAIN THROUGH THE OL FACTORY SYSTEM UM O INTEREST IT IT'S IT'S NOT OF COURSE A A A MAINSTREAME OR WIDELY ACCEPTED THEORY OF ANY TYPE BUT BUT IT'S IT IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS THIS NOTION THAT THAT THE NOSE IS A PATH TO OUR BRAIN I THINK THES NON INVASIVE UM REDOUBTS OF POTENTIAL NER DEGENERATION UM SUCI AS I VISUAL TASK BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE RETINAS ARE PART OF THE BRAIN AND LOSS OF NERNS IN THE RETNA IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER FORMS OF CENTRAL DEGGENERATION ELSIMER UM PARKINSON ET CETERA AS IT'S LILTLE MORE INVASE OF THE WHA YOU'RE DESCRIBING I'M BEGAIN TO WONDER WHY WE DON'T UM GIT AF A AO FACTORY TASK EVERY TIME WE GO TO THE DOCTOR UM THAT WOULD ALLOW TRACKING OVER TIME BECAUSE OF COURSE AS YOU MENTION SOMEWHAT CAN LOSE OUR SENSE OF SMELL DOES NOT MEAN THEIRE GTTING ALSIMERIS NOT NECESSARILY BUT IF THER SENSE OF SMELL WAS TERRIFIC THE YEUARE BEFORE AND IT'S FIFTY PER CENT WORSE THAN EXT O THAT'S AE REALLY BAD TIME TO YOU THAT'S A BAD SIGN AND SO WHATT ROU TIME USNTHING COMPLETELY NON INVASIVE UM THEN COULD BE RELATIVELY PLEASANT TO I NOK YOU AS I PASINLY ORDERS YU SO IT A SO SO FIRST I CAN ANSWER THAT RIGHT AN THE REASON THAT THAT'S NOW HAPPENED AND THAT MIGHT THAT THAT MAY BE CHANGING RIGHT NOW BUT THE REASON THAT HAS NOW HAPPENED IS BECAUSE ALL FACTION HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVELY DIGITIZED ITS IF IF YOU NEED A GENERATE YOU KNOW REALLY PRECISE VISUAL INFORMATION YOU CAN BUY A MONITER FOR E KNOW A HUNDRED BOXS THAT IS IT THE RESOLUT ION OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM BASICALLY AND IF YOU WANT A GENERATE AUDITORY STIMULI REALLY PRECISELY THAN YOU CAN BUY AN AMPLIFIRE FER YOU KNOW MAYBE A BIT MORE THAN UNDR BOXMAN NOT THAT MUCH MORE AND YOU'LL BE AT THE RESOLUTION OF THE ARTITORY SYSTEM IN OUR LAB WE BILD DEVICES THE GENERATE ODERS A WE CALL HIM ALL PHACTOMETERS WHICH IS A MISSNOMER BECAUSE IT DON'T MEASURE ANYTHING BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY' ALWAYS BEEN CALL TO WE CALL HIM ALL FATOMETERS AS WELL AND WE'VE ALREADY BUILT AT LEAST ONE ALL FATOMETER THE COST A QUARTER OF A MILLION EUREA AND IT'S PATHETIC RIGHT SO IT IS IT'S PATHETIC IT'S IT'S SLOW IT'S CONTAMINATED IT'S NOWHERE NEAR THE RESOLUTION OF YOUR SYSTEM SO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT'S NOT HAPPENED IS JUST THE UTTERLY POOR CONTROL OF THE STIMULUS MIND YOU TO SOME EXCENT IT HAS HAPPENED IN THAT THERE THERE ARE AA STANDARD CLINICAL TESTS OF ALL FHACTION BASICALLY TOO THAT SORT OF CONTROL A THE WORLD IN THIS RESPECT THE OLDER ONE IS IS A TEST CALLD TH U PSITEE WHICH STANDS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST IT WAS DEVELOPED BY RICHARD DOUDY AND PEN AND IT'S A TEST WHERE YOU SCRATCH AND SNIFF AND AND IT'S A FOR ALTERNATIVE FORCED CHOICE TESTS WITH FORTY ODER AND SO OF THESE FORTY PAGES THAT U PAGE THROUGH AND YOU SNIFF AND SMELL AND AND A OU KNOW IT'S BEEN NORMED ON GAZILIANS OF TESTS A I I'M ALWAYS AMUSED BY IT BECAUSE SISO RICHARD DODY MADE A HUN OF MONEY A ON THE U PISITEE BUT HE NEEDED IT BECAUSE HE HAS A HABIT HE HAS A NAST CAR SO THIS EVERY TIME WE BUY YOU BEASITEES IN LIVE I SAY THERE'S ANOTHER GALLON OF GAS INTO RICHARD HE RAISE IS NASCO IT'S NOT NOT LIKE NAST CARBO LIKE ONE LOWER THAN THAT LIKE ADENA LIKE SOME SOME SORT OF FORMULA A OR FORMULA FORD OR SOME HE RAISES A CAR AND SO THAT'S WHERE ALL YOU BESITEES ONE SO I ALWAYS FEEL GOOD ABOUT BUYIND YOU THE PIAS ITES BECAUSE I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO THAT GOOD CAUSE BUT KEEPING HIM INININ THE FAST LEN BUT BUT OTHAT'S ONE TEST THAT'S OUT THERE AND AND INDEED YOU KNOW IT AS BEEN SHOWN AS A IUNOSIS OR THERE'S REDUCED TUPIOUS ITEE IN ALSIMERS AND PARKINSONS AND AND IN A HOST OF OTHER DISEASES AND THERE'S A EUROPEAN VERSION CALLED SNIFFING STICKS AH THE TOMASFUMEA HAS DEVELOPED AND ENS ITS BAS LY THE SAME SORT OF CONCEPT OF THAT ONE ISN'T SCRATCH AND SNIFF ITS LIKE THESE PENS THAT YOU OPEN UPEN INS BUT BUT THOSE EXIST BUT THEIR NOD IS IS CONVENIENCES IS A IS THE DELIVERING STIMULA INVISION AN ADITION AND THAT'S WHY I YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT YOU'VE JUST SUGGESTED S  YOU KNOW ANOTHERTHING ANOTHER PLACE WHER YOU DON'T HAVE IT WHICH WHICH I THINK IS EVEN MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE MANYFUL IS IS YOU DON'T OFACTION IS NOT TESTED IN IN NEWBORNS RIGHT WHERE VISION AND AUDITION IS YOR THERE'S THE THING CALLED CAN GENERAL AND OSSME A WRIHT WHICH IS BEING WITHOUT THE SENSE OF SMELL FROM BIRTH SUPPOSED CONGENERAL H WHICH IS A HALF A PER CENT OF THE POPULATION IT'S NOT A TRIVIAL NUMBER NOT TOTAL YA BUT NOBODY KNOWS IF THAT REALLY IS TRUE BECAUSE HE HERES AN AMAZING FACT WIT YES THE AVERAGE AGE IT WHICH CAN GENERAL AN OSSMEA IS DIAGNOISED IND THISIS THIS IS A HORRIBLE STATISTIC FOR ME FOR THE WAY I SEE THE WORLD BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE AVERAGE AGE OF DIAGNOSISES FOR CONGENERALAN OSMEA FIVE YEARS OF AGE FOURTEEN INCREDIBLE FOURTEEN SO MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE ONE HALF OF ONE PER CENT OF THE HUMAN POPULATION PRESUMABLY YA IS A WITHOUT THE SCENSE OF SMELL AND DOESN'T REALIZE THAT UNTIL THEY'RE FOURTEEN YEARS WH I KDON'T KNOW WHEN THEY REALIZED AT FIRST BUT BUT IT'S FORMERLY DIAGNOST AT FOURTEEN ON AVERAGE WHICH MEANS SOME OF THEM EVEN LATER WRIT AND A AND A WRITES A DISTRIBUTION WUT WHAT AM DO THEY SUFFER YES SO SO FIRST OF ALL THEY THEY SUFFER SOCIAL LY UM AND THERE'S A HOST OF OF DELATERIOUS LIFE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONGENTLEEAN OSMAN UM I THE DIUNGER U SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S THIS IS WORK OUT OF A ELORNA CROY IN GERMANY UM AND YOU KNOW AMONGST THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT ARE PREDICTED BY ANOSMEA IS SHORTER LIFE SPAN AH BUT THINGS LIKE YOU KNA REDUCED A SOCIAL CONTACTS A REDUCED UM A ROMANTIC SOCIAL CONTACTS IM IT'S NOT A GOOD THING UM AND AND DO THEY LACKAL FACTORY BULBS IM PRESUING THEY HAVE NOSES AND NOSTRILS THERE IS A CONDITION I'M AWARE OF WERE WERE OUT CHILDREN ARE BORN WITHOUT NOTICE IT IT I VERY RAREYARE VERY RARES OR ORKAS ON THATBES IT'S IT'S EXCEEDINGLY RARE UM SU THEY'RE BORN WITH NOSES AND NOSTRILS I AND HERE'STHE THING RIGHT WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE BORN WITH OL FACTORY BALBS U MOST OF THEM ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE ALL FACTORY BULBS IN ADULTHOOD OR OR I SHOULD REPHRASE THAT HAVE REMNANTAL FACTORY BULBS REALLY SHRIVELED OL FACTORY BULBS BUT YOU KNOW NOBODY CAN SEE THE CAUSE AND EFFECT HERE BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE RULE OF THE THE A REQUIREMENT FOR O FACTORY BULBSFORAL FACTION A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC IN ITS OWN RIGHT I I CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEIR INDICRAN SYSTEM IS ALTERED BECAUSE AS WILL SOON TALK ABOUT THEREIS A LOT OF SIGNALING THROUGH THE NOSE FRUM BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT A TRIGGERS THINGS EVERYTHING FROM THE ONSET OF PUBERTY TO FEELINGS OF ROMANTIC ATTRACTION ATTACHMENT THESE SORTS OF THINGS UM IS IT KNOWN WHETHER OR NOT AND I SHOULD S EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING MYSELF BUT SANS I'M INTERRUPTING YOU EVERY FIVE MANCEWOR MIS WILL INTERRUPT MYSELF TOO THAT UM WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE PROXIMITY OF THE OL FACTORY SYSTEM TO  SOME OF THE HYPOTHOLAMIC SYSTEMS THAT REGULATE THE RELEASE OF GANATA TROPENS WE NANTRAL TUSTOSTRONE AND ASTROGEN PRODUCTION ET CETERA SO AM ARE THEY A HORMONALY NORN SO SOME ARE AN SOME ARNTS IN ALL ALL BE SPECIFIC SO AM THERE IS A CONDITION NS COMMON CYNDRUM WHICH IS HYPOGUANATIC A DEVELOPMENT  IN IN MEN AND IN COLMN CYNDRUM A THE'RE PRACTICALLY ALL ANOSMAC SO SO TANS YOUR QUESTION YES THERE IS A DIRECT LINK AND AND IT MATERIALIZES IN COMMON CYNRM THAT' SAID NOT ALL CONGENERALLY ANOSMIC A INDIVIDUALS HAVE COMMON CNDRUM AND NOT ALL BUT ALMOST ALL PEOPLE HAVE COMMONCINDROM AR IN OSMA SO SO CO COMMON CYNDRUM A GOS WITH A AN OSMA I THINK O THERE IS A FEMALE EQUIVALENT OF COLMANS OR I DON'T REMEMBER ITS NAME A IT'S NOT TURN IT'S NOT A IN THE TURNER CYNDRUM FAMILY O NOSHORE O CAND I THINK IT'S ALL SO ASSOCIATED WITH ANOSMEA A BUT I'M NOT CONFIDENT OF THAT BUT COMMONS AS IS ASSOCIAVA ANOSZMEA A SO SO THE ANSWER IS AS YES AND AND YOU KNOW WE CAN MAY BE YOU KNOW ALL ALL FACTION AND REPRODUCTION ARE ARE TIGHTLY LINKED AND AND THE'RE TIGHTLY LINKED IN ALL MAMALS AND WE ARE BIG TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS AND ALL FASHION REPRODUCTION AR LINCON HUMANS AS WELL IM TYET WE WILL DEFILALY GET INTO THAT I HAVE A STORY SLASH QUESTION THAT I'D LIKE TE AM TELL YOU ASK YOU AS A SEG WAY TO THAT I'M NOTING OF COURSE THE THAT WILL GET BACK TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR A FACTORY BULBS YES OR NO FERAL FACTION AH AND AM THIS RELATO WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I GRUP AT THE AEND OF A STREET WITH A A LOT OF BOYS OF MY AGE WHO JUST LYKE QWINSENS HAD A LOT OF ALLHER SISTERS THEREWERE MY SISTER MY OLDER SISTERS AGE IS FORTUNATE I LOT OF KIDS TO PLAY WITH WE WOULD HANG OUT EACH OTHER'S HOUSES BY BUILD JUMPS AND DO ALL IS THINGS LIKE KIDSTUFF WORT STUFF GET INTO TROUBLE OR WHAT NOT AND OFTENTIMES WE WOULD AND A BLIEVING OUR ARTICLES OF CLOTHING AT EACH OTHER'S HOUSES ALL THE TIME LIKE TEA SHIRTS AND JACKETS AND SO MY MOM WAS CONSTANTLY COMING IN AND SAYING THERE'S ALL THERE'S IS CLOTHES LIKE SOMEONE LEFT IS HERE I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS WE 'RE ALL MORE LESS THE SAME SIZE AND FROM TH AS FAR BACK AS I COULD REMEMBER SIX SEVEN YEARS OLD AND ONWARD I COULD PICK UP A SHIRT OR A JACKET SMELL IT AND SAY OH OLL THAT'S ERIC IS AN ARTS SHIRT A FRIEND OF MINE THERE I GUST GAVE HIS NAME WORK OH THAT'S GOT MADSON SHIRT I I COULD JUST SMELL THE SHIRT AND IN A CONSCIOUS WAY KNOW WHO IT BELONGED TO HAVING NEVER I PROMISE NOT THAT I WOULD PRETEND IF I HAD IF I HAD UM PRETEND I HADN'T IF I HAD BUT HAVING NEVER ACTUALLY DONE THE EXERCISE OF GOING AND TAKING AN SMELLING MY FRIEND INTENTIONAL RIGHT NAY IN FACT IF ANYTHING I HAD ALL THE REASONS IN THE WORLD TO AVOID SMELL AT OTHER YOUNG BOYS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD O CASE SOA UM THAT RAISES A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE CONSCIOUSLY AND OR SUBCONSCIOUSLY COTING IDENTIFICATION OF PEOPLE THAT WE INTERACT WITH FREQUENTLY OR INFREQUENTLY IN TERMS OF THEIR SMELL AND WORE SOME OTHER ASPECT OF THERE A CHEMISTRY YEM SYES AH WE'RE DOING THAT ALL THE TIME IN MY VIEW AND A LOT OF THIS PROCESSINE ALMOST ALL OF IT A IS SUBCONSCIOUS AND I DON'T KNOW WHY ALREADY ALREADY PUT THAT OUT THERE RIGHT I HAVE NO IDEA WHY WHY A HUMAN NATURE HAS HAS ZA OR OR NATURE OR CULTURE OR WANT NOT HAS AS AS PUSH THIS INTO THE REALM OF OF SUBCONSCIOUS AND SOMETHING WERE UNAWARE OF UM BUT WE DO IT ALL THE TIME AN AN UM AN OUR LAB HAS LOTS OF STUDIES ON THIS FRONT IM ONE OF THEM YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH IT IT HAD GAIN SOME NOTORIETY BECAUSE IT'S AMUSING IM SO IS O WEET WE LOOK AT HUMAN BEHAVIOU'RE A LOT WE TRY TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH OUR NEWS A IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING YOU KNOW WE TRY TO THINK YOU KNOW IF I WAS A DOG WEL WHAT WOULD I THINK OF THIS AND AND YOU IF YOU LOOK AT DOGS RIGHT THEY THEY'VE YEU KN WHEN THEY INTERACT THEY VISIBLY SNIFF EACH OTHER IT'S VERY OBVIOUS THEY WALK UP TO EACH OTHER AND THEY SNIFF EACH OTHER IM AND YET HUMANS DON'T TYPICALLY WALK UP TO A STRANGER AND CAREFULLY SNIFF THEM RIGHT I MEAN IT'S YOUIT WE'RE WE'RE SOT OF OBLIGED TO SNIFF OR OUR BABIES THAT'S CONSIDERED ALMOST SOMETHINGYOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO M AND IT'S NOT CULTURALLY TABUDA SNIFF OUR LOVED ONES IT SOT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN ODD THING TO DO BUT WE DON'T SNIFF STRANGERS RIGHT WELL OR DO WE SO WE'RE FINDING MORE AND MORE MECHANISMS WHERE WE DO THIS AND ND THE ONE I'M REFERRING TO NOW FOR ONE EXAMPLE IS WE STARTED LOOKING AT HANDSHAKING HANDSHAKING IS THIS REALLY ODD BEHAVIOUR AND IT'S NOT ONLY IN THE WEST BY THE WAYS SOME PEOPLE THINKS IT'S ONLY A WESTERN THING IT'S NOT IT'S ALMOST EVERYWHERE ANDAND THERE'S REALLY POOR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS BEHAVIOR EVOLVED LIKE WHERE IS WHERE DID THIS THING COME FROM SO IF YOU YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK FOR THE WIKAPETY AVERSION RIGHT AND THEY'LL TELL YOU THAT IT'S TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE NOT HOLDING A WEAPON IN YOUR HAND BUT THERE'S REALLY NO GOOD EVIDENCE FOR THAT IT'S A BIT LIKE THE TRILLING BLOODHOUND RECEPTRA STORY RIGHT I MEAN WE TRY TO FIND AT IN A WIDE PEOPLE SAY THAT AND THEY JUST DO AND WE STARTED LOOKING AT PEOPLE HANDSHAKING AND AND WE NOTICED OR IT SEEM TO US THAT WE'RE NOTICING THAT NOW PEOPLE WILL SHAKE HANDS AND THEN GL LIKE THIS AND LIKE THOSE OF YOU I NOA AM NO A TERIS TAKING HIS HAND AND AND WIPING IT ON HIS FACE YAIN O NOA COUCHIN NICE INS ALINE YA THESE THINGS THESE THINGS THAT WED  ALL THE TIME AFTER A HAND SHAKE WELL SO SO FRS WALL WE DO THEM ALL THE TIME JUST PERIOD RIGHT THE BASE LINE HERE IS REALLY HIGH AND WI'LL GET TO THAT A SECOND BUT BUT BUT THESE BEHAVIORS THAT YOU KNOW YOU COULD EASILY NOT NOTICE RIGHT AND AND SO WE WE ASKED WHETHER THAT'S A REAL THING U AND THIS WAS A STUDY LED BY DONE FROOMING IN OUR LAB AT THE TIME UM AND WHAT WE DID FIRST AND AND IF YOU WANT YWE CAN LINX O SO THIS WAS PUBLISHED IN E LIFE IN ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT E LIFE IS THAT IT HAS A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO A IMBEDVIDIOS IN THE PUBLICATION SO IF YOU WANT WE CAN LINK THIS TO YOUR SYSTEM LATER ON THE TE LIVEN THE SHOWN OUT CAPTONS AS A LINK AUN YOU TO BEEN THE OTHER FOR A PLATFORM SPOTIFY OFICE SO SO WHAT WE DID IS IS A WE WE BROUGHT IN PARCHASPENCE TO OUR LAB AND WE SAT THEM IN THE ROOM A EXPERIMENT ROOM AND AND TOLD THEM THE EXPERIMENT WOULD START SOON AND THEY SHOULD WAIT FOR US THERE THEY DIN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE COMING FROM UNBENOENTES TO THEM THEY WERE READY BEING VIDIOED OF COURSE LATER ON THEY THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO NOT AGREED US SAVING THE VIDIO IN WHICH CASE WE WOULD TO LEAD IT IMMEDIATELY OR OR LETTING US USE IT FOR SCIENCE OR SOME LETTING US USE IT FOR MORE THAN SCIENCES FOR FOR THE VIDIO THAT'S NOW O NEA LIFE AND AND WE WALK INTO THE ROOM AND SAY YO CAN JUST WAIT HERE A WELL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU A TO SIT UP OUR EXPERIMENT AND THEY WOULD SIT THERE FOR THREE MINUTES AND DURING THOSE THREE MINUTS WE COULD LATER QUANTIFYNG HOW MUCH INDEED THEY JUST BY BASE LINE HOW MUCH THEY TOUCH THEIR NOSE OR THEIR FARHEAD OR THEIR CHIN OR HOW MANY TIMES THEIR HAND A REACHES THEIR FACE AND BY THE WAY THAT BASE LINE IS NOT LOW MOGEN AND THEN THREE MINUTES LATER AN EXPERIMENT WOUL WALK INTO THE ROOM AND WOULD SHARE A CONSISTENT TEXT IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL SETTING UP OUR EQUIPMENT IN THE OTHER ROOM AR AN ANSO DIS WAIT HERE AND WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU BUT IN THE MEANTIME JUST WAIT HERE AND THE EXPERIMENT WENT THROUGH THIS LIKE TWENTY SECOND FIXED TEXS AND IN HALF OF THE CASES INCLUDED A HANDSHAKE THIS WAS A NEW EXPERIMENT OR NOT THE ONE PUT THEM IN THE ROOM SO THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY MET SO BELOWIME YOU KNOW SO AND SO THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HAND AND SHAKE THEIR HAND OR NOT AGAIN WE DID ALL POSSIBLE INTRACTIONS INTROMS OF GENDER SO WE MATCHED A MALE PARTICIPANCS WITH MALE AND FEMALE EXPERIMENTERS AND FEMALE PARTISPENTS WITH FEMALE AND MALE EXPERIMENTERS AND SO YOU HAD HANDSHAKE IN NO HANDSHAKE CONDITIONS AND THEN YOU CALN QUANTIFY THAT BEHAVIOUR OF THE HAND GOING TO THE NOSE AFTER HANDSHAKE AND THERE WAS A REMARKABLE INCREASE IN THE HAND GOING TO THE NOSE AFTER HANDSHAKE AND THIS IS ONE OF THE NICE CASES WE THE PAPER INCLUDE STATISTICS BUT YOU DON'T NEED SITITIC HERE JUST LOOK AT THE VIDIO IT'S UNIT'S UNREL THE VIDI WAS UNREAL SO INTERESTED THE HAND GOES TO THE NOSE NOW WE DID A FEW CONTROLS HERE TO VERIFY THAT THIS IS ANOR FACTORY BEHAVIOUR ONE IS UNBENONSTY AN TO PARTICIPANCE WE MEASURED NASAL AIRFLOW AND AND PEOPLE NOT ONLY BRING THEIR HAND TO THEIR NOSE THEY SNIFF IT SO IN THIS IS PERFECTLY TIME THEY GO LIKE THIS A CASE OF THEIR SNIFFING THEIR HAND AND AN AN ADDITIONAL CONTROL STUDY WE MANIPULATED IT SO WE BUILT THIS LITTLE JAMES BOND THING OF A WATCH ON THE EXPERIMENTER'S HAND THAT COULD EDMIT AN ODOR AND THE EXPERIMENT OR DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ODOR THEY WERE EMITTING AND THEY COULD ADMIT EITHER A PLEASANT OR AN UNPLEASANT ODOR ND WE COULD DRIVE THE SELF SAMPLING AFTERWARDS UP OR DOWN SO THIS WAS AN OLD FACTORY BEHAVIOR NO DOUBT ABOUT IT MEN WERE WERE QUITE CONFIDENT THO PEOPLE IN THAT CASE PEOPLE MUST HAVE BEEN SENSING THE ODOR ON THEIR OWN HAND BECAUSE THEY SHAKE HE SHOOK THE HAND OF THE OF THE EXPERIMENTOR PLEASANT ODOR AND THEIR MORE FREQUENTLY BRINGING THAT HAND TO THEIR NOSE VERSES UNPLEASANT ODOR UGHT THAT  HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO THEIR OWN HAND BY THE EXPERIMENTER ABIT  NOITH I THINK THEY WERE SENSING  THE ANVIENT ODOR THAT CAME IN WITH THE HAND THAT THAT CHOKE AND THEN THAT EITHER DROVE THEM TO SNIFP THEIR HANDS MORE OR LESS THE ODOR CLOUD AND OF THE EXPRAIAN AND E THEREIS AN INTERESTING THING GOING ON HERE TOO BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T ONLY SMELL THE HAND THAT SHOOK THEY ALSO SMELLED THE OTHER HAND AND AND WE THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON HERE COMPARING SELF TO OTHER AND WE THINK A LOT OF SELF SAMPLING MIGHT MIGHT REFLECT THAT THERE'S ON THIS SAME LINE AND AGAINTO T LINK TO YOUR CHILDHOOD STORY OF A IDENTIFYING YOUR FRIENDS BY BY SMELL A STUDY WE PUBLISHED JIS LAST YEAR BY A BOTHEROFREBIAN IN OUR LAB AM WE'RE IN BOD CAME WITH THIS A A BASIC INTEREST AND THIS PHENOMENON THAT'S LOOSELY REFERRED TO HIS CLICK FRIENDSHIPS SO PEOPLE YOU MEET AND YOU CLICK RIGHT AWAY RIGHT YOU IMMEDIATELY BECOME CLOSE FRIENDS AND THIS IS A PHENOENA THAT YOU KNOW IS POORLY DESCRIBED OR IS POORLY DESCRIBED AND LILITERATURES AS AS AN ENTITY AND YET ANYBODY WILL TELL YOU THEY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT I MEAN IF YOU TELL THT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY Y CLICK WITH BRIGDE AWAY YOU YOU BECOME INTIMATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES RIGHT EVERYBODY EXPERIENCED THIS IN THEIR LIFE YOU KNOW TO SOME EXTENT AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WAS THERE RIGHT WHAT WAS IT WAS IT BECAUSE YOU LOOK THE SAME COULD BE WAS IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAD THE SAME SPORTS TEAM THAT YOU LIKED OR IS THERE IS SOMETHING  A DEEPER HERE AND AND INBAS THEORY WAS THAT THAT AM THAT SIMILARITY IN BODY ORDER MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THIS THAT PEOPLE WHO SMELL THE SAME WILL CLICK IN SOME WAY AND SO DO JUST THAT SHE SHE ACTUALLY RECRUITED A AM CLICK FRIENDS FROM ALL OVER ISRAEL SHE POSTED ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA A TO IDENTIFY A PARS OF FRIENDS WO THESE ARE OUR SAME SEX NON ROMANTIC DIATS O THESE OUR FRIENDS MEN AND WOMEN A WHOSE FRIENDSHIP STARTED IS A CLICK WEARE HERE THIS BECOMES SENSITIVE BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE MUTUAL CLICK RIGHT LATER ON WE DISCOVERED THERE COAND BE ONE SIDED CLICKS SO SOMEBODY'S SURETHY CLICKED WITH SOMEBODY ELSE BUT THE OTHER PERSON THERE'S A NAME FOR THAT IN NAUROLOGY THAT OUR A COMMON FRIEND THE LATE BEN BARRASS TAUGHT ME WHICH IS THERE'S A PHRASE THAT NAUROLOGIST YOU SOGAY CALLED STICKY THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT COME UP TO YOU AND AND START ASKING QUESTIONS AND THEN WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE THEY THEYR SO CALLED STICKY EL THAT AND IF YOU ASKD THESE STICKY PEOPLE AM STICKY IN AIR QUOTES AS ARE NOT PHYSICALLY STICKY AM THEY MAY BE WHAT A THEY COULD BE AM YOU KNOW IWHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PART THIS PERSON THEY'LL SAY OTHEIR GREAT WERE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS AND SO THEY'VE MADE A UNALATERAL A CLICK FRIENDSHIP AND A YES NAUROLOGIST ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU IF YOURE IF YOUARE ONE OF THESLE ROLOGIS AR TI O OTHERS A AN AN INFORMAL DIGNUSTAN HOD  STICKY SO SO SO A SHE SHE RECRUITED AUM AM CLICK FRIENDS AND THEN SHE AM SAMPLE THEIR BODY ORDER AN AND WE ARE AA PROL CALL FOR THIS O THEY'RE GIVEN YOU KNOW AA ODOLESS CHAMPOON SOAP TO USE FOR THREE WEEKS FOR SOMETHING AND THEN THEY SLEEP TWO NIGHTS IN THIS TEASHER A WERE THEY HAVE TO SLEEP ALONE AND THEN WE EXTRACT THE BODY ORDER FROM THE TEASHIR AND S WE HAVE A WAY TO EXTRACT A METHOD TO EXTRACT BODY ORDER AND THEN SHE SHE FIRST ASKED AM WHETHER INDEED CLICK FRIENDS ARE MORE SIMILAR IN THEIR BODY ORDER THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT BY CHANCE AND SHE FIRST TESTED THIS WITH WITH A DEVICE MACHINE WE CALL IN ELECTRONIC NOSE SO AN ELECTRONIC NOSE IS SOT AF VERY POOR EFFORT TO MACK WHAT THE MAMELIAN KNOS DOES BASICALLY IT'S A BUNCH OF CENSURES THAT RESPON TO AIR BORNE MOLECULES IN THIS CASE SENSEHER'S REF TO HIS MOXERS AS A METAL OXSIDE COVERED CENSERS AM AND SO SHE USED AN ELECTRONIC NOSE TO SAMPLE THESE BODY ORDERS AND SHE FOUND THAT CLICK FRIENDS ARE INDEED MORE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER A THEN YOU WOULD EXPECT  BY CHANCE BY RANDOM DIADS AND IN THE S WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AND AFTER SHE FOUND THAT A DEVICE COULD DO THIS SHE HAD OTHER PARTICIPANTS DO THIS SO SO SHE HAD PEOPLE SMELLING THE CLICK FRIENDS FOR AS NONCLICK FRIENDS AND AND THEY JUDGED THEM AS BEING MORE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER AH THAN NOT NOW AGAIN YOU MIGHT ONDER IS THIS COUSAL OR NOT RIGHT BECAUSE MAYBE CLICK FRIENDS GO TO THE SAME RESTAURANT TOGETHER ALL THE TIME WHATEVER LIVE IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD AND AND THAT'S WHY THEY THEY THEY SMELL THE SAME SO TO ADDRESS CAUSALITY SHE RECRUITED TORTAL STRANGERS AND FIRST SMELL THEM WITH THE ELECTRONIC NOSE AND THEN ENGAGE THEM IN A SOCIAL INTERACTION SOMETHING CALLED THE MIRROR GAME SO IN THE MIRROE GAME ONE PERSON MOVES THEIR HANDS AND THE OTHER PERSONIS REALLY CLOSE TO THEM LIKE RIGHT HERE O THEY CAN SMELL EACH OTHER AND HAS TO MOVE THEIR HANDS WITH THE OTHER PERSON AND ONE ONE PREDICTION THEIR PANNED OUT A BUT ANOTHER DIDN'T THE ONE THAT DIDN'T SO SHE PREDICTED THAT PEOPLE WOULD SMELL MORE A SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER WOULD BE BETTER AT THE MIRROR GAME THAT IS THEY WOULD FOLLOW EACH OTHER BETTER THAT DID NOT PAN OUT HOWEVER SHE THEN ALSO HAD THE INTRACTION WAS COMPLETELY NONVERABLE THEY WERE NOT OUT TO SPEAK WITH EACH OTHER AND SHE DID AT ENTIRE ROUND ROBIN SO EVERYBODY PLAYED WITH EVERYBODY ELSE THIS WAS AN INSANE EXPERIMENT TO RUN AND SHE THEN AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT EACH PERSON RATED EACH OTHER PERSON AS TO HOW MUCH THEY THINK THEY WOULD WANT TO BE THEIR FRIENDS AND ALSO IN A BUNCH OF RAITINGS HOW NICE THEY THINK THEY ARE HOW AFFECTIONAT THEY THINK A BUNCH OF RAITING SOKATE ALL OF THIS WAS PREDICTED BY THE ELECTRONIC NOSE SO PEOPLE WHO SMELL MORE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER THINK THAT THE OTHER PERSON IS MORE LIKELY TO BE THEIR FRIENDS IS MORE LIKELY TO BE A NICE PERSOND ET CETERA ET CETERA SO WE COULD ACTUALLY PREDICT FRIENDSHIP USING THE ELECTRONIC NOSE SO THIS IS NOT A RESULT OF FRIENDSHIP IT'S IT IT PLAYSNIT THE COUSAL ELEMENTS OF BUILDING FRIENDSHIP SO THIS IS TO RELATE TO YOUR CHILDHOOD'S STORY A THERE IS SOMETHING GOING T HERE WORET WORK CONSTANTLY SMELLING OURSELVES CONSTANTLY THIS CONSTANTLY AND U IF YOU ANE TE LIK THE REASON I'M SMILING AVIN IN IN YOUR VIOURS OR LISTENERS WILL UNDERSTAND WHY I AM SMALLING I'LL SEND YOU A VIDIO TO LINK A A IN IN IN INTYR PODGAST HERE WE THOUGHT OF CALLING TAT  THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CONSTANTLY SNIFF THEMSELVES WE THOUGHT OF CALLING THIS LOW EFFECT AND LO I SITISOMN IN AMERICA THIS WON'T PASS THAT EFFECTIVELY BUTIN IN THE REST OF THE NORMAL WORLD A YACHHIN LO IS THE SOCKER THE NATIONAL SOCRACOACH OF THE GERMAN SOCRATEIM SO I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHO TO BE A VERY FAMOUS COACH HERE BUT TEEV KUR AING THIS IS THA YOU KNOW  THIS IS A SUPERSUPERFAMOUS A NAME ALL ROUND THE WORLD WHERE SOCKER IS THE PRIMARY SPORT THAT PEOPLE WATCH AM AND AND ONCE PEOPLE WILL SEE THIS FEDIO THEY'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WE THOUGHT OF CALLING THIS LOW EFFECT A IS VERY GRAPHIC AH BUT BUT PEOPLE ARE CONSTANT SMELLING OURSELVES THEY ARE SMELLING THEMSELVES WITH THEIR HANDS THERE ARE SMELLING THEMSELVES EXPLICITLY PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY SMELLING THEMSELVES CONSTANTLY SMELLING OTHERS A I FIND THIS TOBJECT SO INTERESTING A AND FIRST OF ALL CONFESSION I DEFLING SMELL MYSELF MULTIMLE TIMES PER DAY AND EVERYBODY DOES I'LL KET GOOD AND I I AM I WOULD DO IT ANYWAY A A I THINK I LIKE MOST PEOPLE I EITHER FIND MY OWN SMELL TO BE NEUTRAL TO PLEASANT MI I A OCCASIONALLY I ON I NEAN TO TAKE A SHOWER AS LONG AS WEARE TALKING ABOUT SMELLING ONESELF AND A FRIENDSHIP KINSHIP AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO SMELL WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SMELL AND ROMANTIC ATTRACTION AND MAUND SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF FOR INSTANCE A MOUSE IS GIVEN THE OPTION TO MEET WITH ANY NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFERENT MICE THEY WILL BUIAS THEIR CHOICE TOWARD THE MOUSE THAT HAS THE IMMUNE COM POSITION THE SO CALLED EM MAJOR HISTO COMBATIBILITY COMPLEX WITH PLEX AMUNE DIVERSITY THE IMUNE SYSTEM THAT IS MOST DISTANT FROM THEIRS AT THE THE EVOLUTIONARY ARGUMENT BEING THAT WORD THEY TO A PRODUCE OFFSPRING THAT THE ARRAY OF AMUNGINES WOULD BE MUCH BROADER THAN IF THEY WERE TO SELECT AN ANIMAL VERY CLOSE O THEM AN IN ADDITION TO THAT THAT ONE OF THE MOST STRONGLY SELECTED AGAINST BEHAVIORS NOTJUS CULTURALLY BUT AT THE LEVEL OF ELICITING A SENSE OF DISGUST MAYBE EVEN FROM THE ACTIVITY OF THE HYPOTHALEMIS IS MATING WITH VERY CLOSE KIN AKA INCEST BECAUSE THAT CON POTENTIAL IT WE KNOW PRODUCES THE HIGHRATE OF MUTATIONS IN OTHER WORDS WHEREAS YOU DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHINP BETWEEN SMELL AND CHOICE OF FRIENDS AS YOU O CHOOSE PEOPLE WHO SMELL MORE LIKE YOU MINORSTANDING IS THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF AT SO CHOOSING ROMANTIC PARTNERS OR SEXUAL PARTNERS ARE BOTH THAT YOU CHOOSE THE PERSON WHOSE ODOR AND THEREFORE IMMUNE COMPOSITION IS MOST DIFFERENT RATE SO THE WE DESCRIBED THE ANIMAL LITERATUREIS CORRECT AND THERE'S EVIDENCE SIMILAR MECHANISMS IN HUMANS OUR LAB HAS NOT WORKED DIRECTLY ON THIS ISSUE OF OA OF THE ROMANTIC SELECTION BASED ON ODOR A THEREIS A BUNCH OF PAPERS A WEDKIND AD ALLEN IN THE WEDKIN LAB AND ALSO PORTER A AL EMIALIS HU LATER ON A THAT HAVE HAVE DONE A LOT OF THIS WORK AND FIND EXACTLY AS YOU SAY THAT THEY DA A ROMANTIC ODORPREFERENCES IN HUMANS A OUR INFLUENCE BY BODY ODOR AND THAT THIS IS LINKED TO A EME SEE A A A HYSOCOMETIBILITY COMPLEX MAKE UP OF THE THE PORTION OF ARGINU THAT THE SHAPES ARE UN SYSTEM A TO SOME EXTENT AM O TO THIS EFFECT A HAS BEEN STUDIED AND REPORTED ON AGAIN EXT NSIVELY IN MICE AND ALSO A IN IN HUMANS AM NOT WORK THAT THAT WE'VE DONE AUM THE ONE SORT OF TANGENT WORK WE'VE DONE AN AN AND ILIKE O MAY BE TELL YOU ABOUT IT RELATES TO TO AN EFFECT THAT THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE EFFECTS AND IN MAMELIAN SOCIAL CUMO SIGNALING SO AND AN ALSO RELATED TO TO SO IT IT'S NOT RELATED TO ROMANTICISM IN ANYWAY OR BUT BUT BUT ITS RELATED TO REPRODUCTION AND INDEED IN OUR LOB WE'VE NOT LOOKED AT ROMANCICISM WE HAVE LOOKED AT ARE OUR LOOKING AT REPRODUCTION THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME M CERTAINLY GAN N ANIMAL MAMILIAN OR TERRESTRIAL MAMELIAN REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR IS IS DOMINATED BY BY THE SENSE OF SMELL MIN EMMAMALS AND HERE REMEMBER INITIALLY ENWE STARTED OFF I I NOTED THAT THEIR SEBERAL SUBSYSTEMS IN OUR NOSE THAT TRANSDUCE ORDORANS AN IN SO PRIMARILY THE THE MANAL FACTORY SYSTEM THE WHICH IS CRENIAL ER NUMBER ONE AND THE TRIGENERAL NERVE WHICH IS CRENIAL NUMBER FIVE A MOST TERRESTRIAL MAMALS HAVE ANOTHER SUBSYSTEM REFERRED TO AS THE THE A SECONDARYAL FACTORY SYSTEM THAT HAS A SEPARATE SENSE ORGAN IN IN THE NOSE THIS ORGAN IS KNOWN AS THE FORMERR NASAL ORGAN IT'S A A SMALL PIT IN THE NASAL PASSAGE OF OF MOST TERRESTRIAL MAMALS SOMETIMES IT'S A DESCRIBED IS A COMMUNICATING PIT BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT CONNECTS THE NASAL PASSAGE TO THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH SOMETIMES IT COM CONNECTS BOTH AND SO THERE IS THE SENSE ORGAN WITH ITS SPECIFIC RECEPTR SUBTYPES A VIANARS VERMORNAZAL RECEPTORS AND A THIS AMUMIS LINKD TO U TO US SORT OF SEPARATE PORTION OF THE AL FACTORY BALB NOT REALLY E MANL PATRIGALBOTSERFRIT AS THE ACCESSORIAL FACTORY BALB AMAND FROM THEIR DIRECTLY TO THE LYMBIC SYSTEM TO THE TO THE PORTIONS OF THE BRAIN THE CONTROL REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR AN AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR AND AND IN MOST A TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS THIS SUBSYSTEM PROCESS'S ODORANCE THERE ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO HIS PEREMONS A O THAT'S IN MANY WAYS OF PROBLEMATIC TERM BUT BUT ODORANCE THAT ARE FRTROS FIRMONS NAMETHE ODORANCS THAT ARE METTED BY ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE SPECIES TO INFLUENCE O THAT MEMBER OF THE SPECIES AND ALTAR BEHAVIOR OR HARMONAL STATE AND AND IN SOME OF THESE FERMONAL EFFECTS ARE ARE UTTERLY REMARKABLE AND IN MY VIEW THE MOST REMARKABLE OF ALL AS AN EFFECT KNOWN AS THE BRUSE EFFECT AH THIS WAS AN EFFECT DISCOVERED BY MARGARET BRUCE IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE SHE WAS A A BRITISH A SCIENTIST AND IN THE BRUCE EFFECT WHEN YOU EXPOSE A PREGNANT MOUSE AT AN EARLY CRITICAL STAGE OF THE PREGNANCY I THINK UP TO ABOUT DAY THREE AH IF YOU EXPOSE THE PREGNANT MOUSE AH TO THE ODOR OF WHAT IS REFERRED TO IN TECHNICAL TERMS IS THE NON STUD MALE THAT IS A MALE WHO DID NOT FATHER THE PREGNANCY SHE WILL MISCARRY THE REGNANCY SHE WILL ABOARD IT NOW THAT THAT'S AN INSANE DECISION MADE BY THE FEMALE HERERIGHT BECAUSE SHE IS INVESTED QUITE ALOD IN THIS RIGHT IN IN IN BIOLOGICAL TERMS AND IN INFORMING THIS PREGNANCY AND MAINTAINING IT AND YET SHE DROPS IT ON THE BASIS OF AN ODOR A AND THIS EFFECT IS REMARKABLY ROBUST AND WHAT DO I MEAN BY REMARKABLY ROBUS O THIS WILL OCCUR ON ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF EXPOSURES NOAS YOU KNOW EIGHT EIGHTY PER CENT IS A HNDRED PER CENT IN BIOLOGY RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAPPENS IT MORE THAN EG PER CENT SO IT'S A REMARKABLY EREMARKABLY ROBUST EFFECT THIS THIS DROPPING OF THE PREGNANCY AND WE KNOW IT'S MEDIATED BY KEMO SENSATION TRO TO NOL SURE AND WE KNOW IN THE FOLLOWING WAY SO FIRST IT'S ENOUGH TO JUST BRING THE ODER OF THE NONSTEAD MALE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING THE MALE HIMSELF WRIGHTS TO JISCAN BRING BEDDING FROM A NONSEN MALE AD THAT WILL INDUCE A THE BRUSE EFFECT BUT OF COURSE THE MOST TELLING SET OF EXPERIMENTSIS THAT IF IN THE FEMALE MOUSE YOU ABLATE THE FORMER A NAZAL ORGAN YOU JUST BURN THE TINY STRUCTURE IN THE NOSE THE EFFECT DISAPPEARS SO THE EFFECT IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THE FORMER NAZAL ORGAN AM  ND I FIND THIS OUTOLY A REMARKABLE FACT RIGHT I MEAN I BECO BECAUSE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE THE EXTENT OF OF COST HAT TH THE FEMALE TAKES ON HERE AH BASED ON ON THIS INFORMATION IN SMELL NOW HUMANS THE SORT OF THE GOING NOTION IN ALL FACTION IS THAT HUMANS DON'T HAVE A FUNCTIONAL VOMERINAZAL ORGAN SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT A FUNCTIONAL ORGAN IN OUR NOSE NOW I'LL POINT OUT WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE THE PIT SO THA THE THE STRUCTURE OR THE OUTLINING STRUCTURE IS THERE AH BUT THE PIT THAT WE HAVE IS CONSIDERED VASTIDIAL AN NONFUNCTIONAL WHAT ABOUT THIS THING I LEARNED ABOUT AT BERKLEY AH IN INAGREATO BIOLOGY CLASS THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED JACOBSON'S ORGAN THIS IS THE SAME ORGAN SO SO JACOB'S N ORGANS IS THE FORMER NAZAL ORGAN AH IT'S ALSO CALLED JACOBSON BECAUSE A I THINK JACOBSON WAS A MILITARY PHYSICIAN IN LIKE THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS IN HOLLAND OR SOMETHING AND HE FOUNDED IN IN IN THE SOLDIER WHO AS OPERATING ON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT THATTHE STORY COMES FROM SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT BUT THAT JACOB'S AN ORGAN IS ANOTHER NAME FOR THE FOMER NOLIZAL ORGAN THESE ARE ONE AND THE SAME THE SENSORY ORGAN OF THE ACCESSORIAL FACTORY SYSTEM AND AGAIN THE GO ING NOTION IS THAT THE HUMAN JACOBSON ORGAN OR FROM WENIS ORGAN IS FESTIDIAL IT'S NON FUNCTIONAL DOES THAT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE FARMONE EFFECTS NOW IT DOES NOT SO FIRST OF ALL WE KNOW THAT LOTS OF WHAT ARE CONSIDERED FOR IMMORNAL EFFECTS NAMELY SOCIAL CUMO SIGNOING IN RUDENTS ARE MIDIATED BY THE MANAL FACTORY SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT FOR SHORTH IM THERE'RE SEVERAL EXAMPLES FOR THIS AND MICE AN RATS AND RABBITS AND SONE AND SO FORTH SO SO A A THESE CAN BE MADE MIDIATED BY BY THE MANAL FACTORY SYSTEM AND AND AND A'LL I'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN SECOND BUFIRST TO FINISH THE BRUCE EFFECT AM AND AND SECOND AND AND I'M GOING OUT ON A LIMB HERE AH BUT I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT THAT A RISK IM I'M FOR ME THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON HUMAN VOMERANAZAL ORGAN AM THAT THE DECISION OR THAT THE NOTION AH THAT IT'S NON FUNCTION ALL RELIES ON ABOUT ONE AND A HALF PAPERS PUSS MORTEM AH LOOKING FOR THE NERVE THAT CONNECTS THIS THING TO THE BRAIN AND FAILING TO FIND IT USING STAINING AND SO ON IS FORTH BUT STANDING POS MORTEM STUDIES IN HUMANS ARE ARE NOTORIOUSLY COMPLICATED AM BASLICALLY KNOW FOR MANY REASONS ONE OF THEM IS THAT THE MATERIAL IS JUST ALWAYS HAS GONE THROUGH YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT IDEALLY AA SET AS IT IS WHEN YOU SACRIFICE AN ANIMAL AND AN AND AND STUDY IT'S ITS TISSUE AM SO SO BASED ON ON REALLY REALLY APOSITY OF STUDIES THAT FAIL TO FIND AH THIS NERVE THE NOTION IS THAT THE STRUCTURE IS VASTIDIAL A INHUMANS I DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT'S FUNCTION UMON YOU BUT BUT I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT IT'S N ODD BUT IM WHAT WE DO HAVE A SUSPICION IS THAT HUMANS MAY EXPER E AN SOMETHING SIMILAR TO BRUCIFFECT SO FIRSTOFALL HUMANS HAVE AN ENORMOUS A NUMBERAR RATIO OF OF A OF SPONTANEOUS MISCARRIAGE ARE THEY A OCCURRING MORE OFTEN IN THE FIRST TRYASTER BECAUSE YOU MENTION YES THAT IN THE BRUCE EFFECT IN THE MISES IN THE FIRST THREE DAYS OR SO FALLING OUT PAGNANTY WHICH IN THE MALSE JUSTATION AS I RECALLS ABOUT TWENTY ONE DAYS IN THE MASEUR TORM AT ONE SEVENTH OF TOTAL JUSTATION SOEM I'M NOT QUICK ENOUGH TO TO NOR IS IT IMPORTANT TO TRANSLATE BUT THIS WILL BE FIRST TRYASTER YES WHICH IS INTHE EARLY MOSO WHEN MOST MISCARRIAGE OCCURS NOW HU HUMANS HAVE AGAIN A HUGE NUMBER OF MISCARIAGES AND AND THE NUMBERS ALL A'LL SOON SHARE THEM WITH YOU THAT THEY SOUND ODD AND THE REASON THEY SOUND ODD IS BECAUSE IF IF YOU HAVE WHAT'S SOMETIMES SIMPLY REFERR TO HIS FAILED IN PLANTATION RIGHT THIS CAN OCCUR YOU KNOW IN DAYS ONE TO NOBODY EVER KNOWS OQE SO O SOME PAPERS TALK ABOUT NINETY PER CENT OF ALL HUMAN PREGNANCIES AND IN MISCARRIAGE THIS IS COUNTING AA FAILED IN PLANTATION IN DAY ON TO ET CETERA MORE CONSERVATIVE STUDIES TALK ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT NOBODY WILL ARGUE THIRTY PERCENT O CASE OF A HUGE NUMBER A HUGE NUMBER OF OF A HUMAN PREGNANCIES AND IN MISCARRIAGE NOW OUT OF THESE THEREIS A PORTION THAT ARE ARE UNEXPLAINED RIGHTS O NOBODY KNOWS WHY I MING THERE ARE PORTION THAT ARE EXPLAINED BY ALL SORTS OF GENETIC FACTORS DEVELOPMENTAL FACTORS AND SOAN SO FORTH BUT THERE'S ALSO A PROPORTION THAT ARE UNEXPLAINED AND AND AND SO ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT THEREIS THEREIS A STATISTICAL BACK DROP OR SETTING IF YOU WILL FOR SOMETHING LIKE A REMNANT BRUSEFFECT IN HUMANS NOW WITH THAT IN MIND WE WE APPROACH TO GROUP A F WE WE WE ENLISTED A GROUP OF OF OF THEYE'RE NOT REALLY PATIENCE AND PARTICIPANS IN IN A STUDY OF PEOPLE WHO COUPLES WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HAT IS REFERRED TO IS IS UNEXLAINED REPEATED PREGNENCY LOSS SO FORMERLY IF YOU HAVE A TWO CONSECUTIVE A UNEXPLAINED MISCARRIAGES THAN A THAT THAT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF UNEXPLAINED REPEATED PRGNANCY LOSS HOWEVER IN OUR COHORT OF THIRTY  WE HAD COUPLES WHO EXPERIENCE TWELVE CONSECUTIVE UNEXPLAINED REPEATED PREGENCY LOSSES TO SO THE TWO THE TWO IS JUST THE FORMAL ALL OF OUR COHERT WAS LIKE TWELVE FIVE YOU KNOWSI IT IS AN EMOTIONAL DIFFICULT PLACE TO BE AND AND THESE ARE COUPLES WHOWHOARE LOSING A THEIR PRRENCY FOR NO APPARENT REASON SO THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH ALL THE TEST THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE OF NOR GENETIC INCOMPATIBILITY IS IN ALL SORTS OF ISSUES A CLOTTING A LL THAT ALL THE THE KNOWN SUSPECTS O FOR FREPENANCY LOSS AND THAT THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT REMAINS TOTALLY AT A LOSS IS TO WHY THESE PRNENCES ARENT WHOLDY AND SO WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THAT PERHAPS HERE THERE IS SOMETHING AINTO TO A BRUSE TYPE EFFECT OBVOUSLY SONCAN BE THE SAME AS A MICE BUT BUT SOMETHING LIKE A BRUSE EFFECT NOW OF COURSE AT THAT'SAGE WE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING CAUSAL TO TOTEST THIS RIPT BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IS TO SEE A IN  TO SEEK CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO SEE IF IF WHERE THERE IS FIRE MAY BE THEIR SMOKE AND WHAT WE DID WAS WE TESTED A ALL FACTION IN MORE SPECIFICALLY THE RESPONSE TO TO MALE BODY ORDER A IN IN THE THE COUPLES EXPERIENCING AM A REPEATED PREGNENCY LOSS AND WE FOUND A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL IF YOU THINK OF THE MECHANISM IS BEHIND THE BUCEEFFECT THE BRUCIFEC IMPLIES THAT THE FEMALE HAS TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR MEMORY OF A THE FOTHERING MALE BECAUSE IF SHE'S GOING TO MISCARRY IN RESPONSE TO THE NONFATHER SHE HAS TO KNOW FATHER NDONFATHER I MEAN THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS A PRONOUNCED OR FACTORY MEMORY AT THE MOMENT OF MEANING O CAN AND IN MICE THIS HAS BEEN VERY WELL CHARACTERIZED IN AND ATTRIBUTED TO THE ANTERIAL FACTORY NUCLEUS A STRUCTURE IN THE BRAIN M BUT YOU'LD HAVE TO HAVE THIS MEMORY IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT DECISION NOW SO TO ADDRESS THAT AND HEAR YOUR GOING TO SEE THAT YOU IN YOUR CHILDHOOD STORY FROM BEFORE STAND OUT OF IT AS AS A SKILFUL IS THAT THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS JUST BEHAVIOURLY TEST A WHITHER AM THESE WOMEN AND CONTROL WOMEN COULD IDENTIFY THE SMELL OF THEIR A SPOUSE AND YOU MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED OR YOU KNOW WE WOULD ALL AR PRALBLY A BIT DISAPPOINTED TO LEARN THAT CONTROL WOMEN AR VERY POOR AT THIS SO SOYOU WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOMEN WOULD BE GOODED IDENTIFYING THE BODY ORDER OF THEIR SPOUSE THEY'RE NOT ARE THERE NOT FAR FROM CHANCE HOWEVER AM THE AWOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE A REPEATED PRINCYLOSS ARE MORE THAN THEIR THEIR DOUBLE A AT THEIR PERFORMANCE LEVEL SO THISS NOT A NUANT'S EFFECT A WOMEN WHO WHO WHO W  EXPERIENCE REPEATED A PRINCOS CAN IDENTIFY ATHEIR HUSBANDS OR THEIR SPOUSES A BY THEIR BODY ORDER WITH MUCH GREATER ACUITY THAN THE TYPICAL PERSO DOUBLE A BIT MORE THAN DOUBLE AND WAT AN WAY ABOVE THANCS Y KNOW THA I SO I POSSIS A QUESTION WHUT I BENT YES WITH MUCH GREATER ACUITY A AN DOUBLE AS IT IS  SIGNIFICANT A IMPROVEMENT ARE THEY MUCH BETTER AT DETECTING ANY NO OR NO THEY'RE NOT WE DID THE CONTROLS AND THEY'RE NOT AND THEN AM WE ALSO MEASURED USING AFOM MORI WE MEASURED THEIR THEIR BRAIN RESPONSE TO A STRANGER MALE BODY ORDER AND THERE AN AN AN THIS WAS QUITE REMARKABLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE APPROACH SO THIS WAS A FULL BRIN ANALYSIS OWITHOUT A REGION OF INTEREST AND ALYSIS IT'S NOT IS IF YOU ERE A TWEAKING YOUR STATISTICS TO LOOK AT ONE PART OF THE BRAIN YOU ARE JUST LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE BRAIN AND THE RESPONSE TO MALE BODY ORDER IN ASKING DEY KNOVOYS THER ARE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS AND THERE WIS ONE HUGE DIFFERENCE AND IT WAS IN THE HIPPOTHOLEMIS AND SO THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN RESPONSE TO STRANGER MALE BODY ORDER A BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AM SO SO OLD FACTION IS ALTERED IN SPONTANEOUS REPEATED SPONTANEOUS APPRIENCY LOSS WE DON'T KNOW THIS IS CAUSAL RIGHT A BUT BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR US TO APPROACH THE ETHICS COMMITTEE AM TO RUN A CAUSAL EXPERIMENT AM AND WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT NOW INCREDIBLE I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THE THE RESULTS OF THE IT'S INTERTAINMENT IT'LL PROBALYTACE YEARS AM A FEW BECUT BECAUSE INTHE THESE ARE SLOW EXPERIMENTS TO RUN A UM RECRUITMENT IS COMPLICATED A BUT BASICALLY WERE WE'RE BLOCKING AM WE'RE BLOCKING SMELL IN IN A COUPLES WHO ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN A PRIGANCY I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOME OTHER A SO CALLED FAREMON EFFECTS AND ONE THING I HEARD YOU SAY DURING A TALK WHICH I THINK REALLY CAPTURES THIS WHOLDISSUE OF ARE THEIRE FARIMON EFFECTS IN HUMANS AM VERY NICELY AS YOU SAID YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A CLASSIC FOR  FAREMON EFFECTOR WHETHER NOT ITS ALL FACTION OR SOMETHING ELSE THIS IS KYMOST SENSORY SIGNALING ETWEEN INDIVIDUALS A THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT ME IS A FEW YEARS AGO I DID A SOCIAL MEDIOPOST ABOUT FAREMN EFFECTS AND ANIMALS AND SOME POTENTIAL FARMON EFFECTS IN HUMANS AND A COUPLE OF THE UM A HUMAN A OL FACTIONIS DOES A MORE FROM THE THE I SHALLY WHO WORK ON ANIMAL MODELS REALLY CAME AFTER ME WITH A YOU KNOW INTENSE SNIFFING SAYING AH YOU KNOW THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR HUMAN FERMONOF FACTS HUMAN FRMON ORGANS AND I THINK TO DAY YOU'VE BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED HOW REGARDLESS OF THE ANSWER TO THAT HUMANS ARE CONTAIN AND AREEMITTING CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT INFLUENCE EACH OTHER'S PHYSIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR FOR SURE FOR SURE AND AND HTHE TERM FIRMON IS A PROBLEMATIC TERM IN ANY CASE I MEAN THE TERM THE TERM WAS A PUT FORTH TO DESCRIBE INSECT BEHAVIOR RIGHT SO YOU KNOW IF IF YOU WERE GIVEN A HARD TIME BY THE MOUSE PEOPLE YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN AND EAT THEM AND EQUALLY HARD TIME IF YOU WERE AN INSECT PERSON RIGHT BECAUSE REALLY AT THE PLACE HE TERM IT IS IS ZA IS ACCURATE IS HUNUS O THE FIRST FIRMON THAT WAS DISCOVERED WAS BAMBICCAL WHICH IS THE FIRMON THAT HAS THE MALE MOTH FOLLOW THE THE SEN TRAIL OF THE FEMALE MOTH BAMBICAL IS A FERMON A INSECT FIRMON PEOPLE WILL ARGUE THAT THE STUFF THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IN MICE AND RATS IS NOT FERIMONS AND AND IT ALL BECOME SEMANTIC YET THEY WERE LINE NURDY INSIDE BALL YET'S ALL SEMANTIC SO I DON'T I'D IN OUR PUBLICATIONS WE DON'T USE THE TERM FERIMON YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT HELP ME AND IT WOULD PROBABLY ONLY HURT US AND SO YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT CIMO SIGNALS AND HUMANS DEFINITELY EMIT CIMO SIGNALS FROM THEIR BODY AND THESE CIMO SIGNALS INFLUENCE OTHER HUMANS AND INFLUENCE THEIR BEHAVIOR UNN AN AN THAT THEIR SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF THIS ONE OF THEM ALL ALL POINT OUT FIRST WHICH IS IS THOUGHT OF THE MOST WIDELY STUDIED AND AND NOT MOSTLY FOR OUR LAB ACTUALLY I MEAN THAT HATTHE FLAVOR OF THE MONTH FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS IN THIS FIELD IS WHAT'S REFRICHIS THE SMELL OF FEAR RIGHT TO A THIS IS PROBABLY TRUTH OF MANY MAMALS AND HUMANS A IT'S TRUE OF IM WE EMIT A SPECIFIC BODY ORDER WHEN WE'RE IN A STATE OF FEAR AH THIS WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN HUMANS BY DENISE CHEN M OUT OF I THINK BROWN NATR THINK THAT'S RIGHT HUMAN SUBMIT A PARTICULAR BODY ORDER WHEN THEY'RE IN A STATE OF FEAR AND THIS BODY ORDER OR INFLUENCES OTHER HUMANS IN EFFECT INCREASING ATHEIR AUTONOMIC A AROUSAL THEIR SYMPATHETIC STATE AM SO IN EFFECT YOU COULD SAY THAT FEAR IS CONTAGIOUS A BIT SAID THE SMELL OF FEAR I'S CONTAGIOUS BY THE WAY CULTURALLY WE KNOW FOR AGES THAT DOGS CAN SMELL FURIN HUMANS BUT ACTUALLY THAT WAS ONLY REALLY SHOWIN ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO IN A STUDY SOWAS ALWAYS SAID BUT IT WASN'T REALLY SHOWIN EFFECTIVELY WAS SHOWIN ABOUT I YERE AN A HALF A GOING STUDY THE DOGS INDEED CAN SMELL HUMAN FEAR A AND HUMANS CAN SMELL HUMAN FEAR SO SEVERAL LABS STARTING FROM DENIS CHEN AND HAVELIN JONES AND AND THEN IN OUR LABE AND ANOTHER LABS A IF IF YOU COLLECT BODY ORDER FROM PEOPLE IN A STATE OF FEAR AND COLLECT BODY ORDER FROM THE SAME PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN A STATE OF FEAR A OTHER PEOPLE CAN DETERMINE WHICH IS IS THE STATE OF FEUARE NOT AND AND THIS INFLUENCES THEIR BEHAVIOR WHAT ABOUT THE SMELL OF SAFETY OR IS THAT SIMPLY THE ABSENCE OF THE ODOR CORRESPONDING TO FEAR AND THE REASON I ASKED US IS SOMEWHAT WOVEN INTO OUR A PRIOR DISCUSSION ABOUT MATE CHOICE AM AGAIN ALL ASKED THE QUESTION IN A FORM OF OF BRIEF ANECDOTES A I'LL USE THAT I HAD A FRIEND TO A APPROACH HERE BUT A WELL ONE PHENOMENON HAS NOTHING TO DO A WITH ME IN PARTICULAR I THINK THIS IS A COMMON PHENOMENON IS AM ROMANTIC PARTNERS LEAVING ARTICLES OF CLOTHING AT EACH OTHER'S HOMES NOW THIS COULD HAVE OTHER PURPOSES TO MAR ERTORY BUT AM VUSUALLY MARKING TERRITORY BUT ALSO AM SENT MARKING TERRITORY IS VERY COMMON IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM  A IT'S NOT UNCOMMON A FOR A ROMANTIC PARTNERS WHEN ONE IS RAVELING OR AWAY FOR THE OTHER PARTNER TO SMELL THEIR ARTICLE OF CLOTHING IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT POSITIVE A CONNOTATIONS HAVE THE OTHER PARTNER VERY UNCOMMON BEHAVIOR FOR DOING THIS FOLKS I EVER OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS TOO UM IT RAISES QUESTIONS FOR INSTANCE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE MORNING PERIOD PART POSTBREAK UP WEATHER BY DECISION BY DATH OR BY AM SOME OTHER PHENOMENON THAT'S FORCED THE BREAK UP AM WHETHER NOT THAT MORNING PERIOD HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITHIN OLD FACTORY UNLEARNING A A AM AND MADE SUCH AND ON AND ON AND   WITH ALL HES INSIDES I WAD OFF FOR YOU TO BE OPPOSTOCKIN WELL I WAS GO I THIS I HA  T ATICAL CIN SO I WOULD LOVE TI WAS ADMAAS GING TO KILL MEDI ATHAT YOU DON'T WEN ME TOER I YOU T ABOUT AS MNCE WEN A IOE A IT THERE'S A STORY A WEN NOAS E FR A I  TELLY AN A O AN WI AS TE DON'T REALLY WERE I REALLY AUS I WAS AFOR IN FACT THAT I'VE HAD THREE INCREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC MENTERS A UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE IN POSTTOCK BUT AM FOR REASONS A THAT ARE UNCLEAR TO ME AM A FIRST ONE DIED OF SUICIDE THE SECOND ONE CANCER AT FIFTY IN THE THIRD ONE AM PANCRIATIC ANCER IN HIS EARLY SIXTIES AND THE LAST ONE BEFORE HE DIED WHO IS AN EMPTY IN A COMMON FROND OF NOMES AND I TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU KNOW ANTER YOU'RE THE COMMON DENOMINATOR SO AM KNO THAT THE DI HAD THE THIR NO  IAS AS AS YOU DO R R SO NONE THE LESS I WOUD LOVE TO DOUS AMATICAL IN YOUR LA THAT SO SO WHEN I WAS TRYING TO SAY IN THAT ROUND ABOUT WAYS THAT THIS ARE ALL REALLY KEEN OBSERVATIONS AND GOOD IDEAS IM FOR SURE AND AND AND THE JIS HIGH LIGHT AGAIN YOU KNEW THAT THAT WE'RE INCREDIBLY OL FACTORY ANIMALS YOU KNOW HAVE AND AND IN YOU'R YOU'RE EVEN TOLK ABOUT THE NEWANCS WE'RE VERY OLD FACTORY EVEN NOT IN THE NEWANTS I MEA I HAVE THIS WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T USE OUR SENSE OF SMELLING WE DON'T NEED IT IN AL THAT AND AND I I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS ALOT RIGHT AFTER THEAL LOT YOU STUDY VISION NOBODY'LL TELL YOU THAT VISION IS UN IMPORTANT RIGHT HAVE I VISUALLY DEPENDENT I DON'T NEED A DOG TO TAKE OVER MILE FACTORY SYSTEM IF I LOSAL FACTION BUT I'LL TELL YOU FROM HAVING LOST MY SENSE OF SMELL OR NEVER ONE DAY AY RIH I WAS IN INTENSE FEAR I BID INTO BLUE I LOVE BLUEBERRIES A' LIKE A DRY BY BLUEBERRY EATERS OR THERE I JUST CONE TO PICK THEM UP LIKE A GIRSLY BARRON RAMONIN IN MY MOUTH SO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM ME IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MEATN BUT I CAN'T I  ALMOST CAN'T HELP MYSELF UM I BID INTO A BLUEBERRY OR A HANDFUL OF BLUEBERRIES AND THEY JUST THIT WAS THE SENSATION OF LITTLE BAGS OF WATER AND I IMMEDIATELY FELL A TREMENT H IT TREMENDOUS REEF OTEN A SOT OF A A THROW A LINE THAT I USE IN THIS ONE WHEN I TALK WITH PEOPLE OU KNOW I IM I MEAN YOU KNOW TAKE THE TWO MOST BASIC BEHAVIORS THAT SUSTAIN US RIGHT LET'S A I GIVE YOU A CHOICE BETWEEN A BEAUTIFUL LOOKING LEER CAKE WITH WITH WITH TRAWBERRIES AND BLUEBERRIES AND AND N AND WITH CREAM BUT THAT SMELLS OF SEAGE VERSES SOME GRAY BROWN MAKES THAT SMELLS OF CINNAMEN WHICH DO YOU EAT A SIMPLE THE LARE RIGHT YOU EAT THE LATTER RIGHT NOW IMAGINE I OFFER YOU A MATE CHOOSE THE THE GENDER OF YOUR LIKING RIGHT THAT LOOKS LIKE A GREEK GOD OR GODDESS RIGHT BUT SMELLS OF SEAGE OR AN ORDINARY LOOKING INDIVIDUAL THAT SMELLS OF CIN ITSELF WHO DO YOU CHOOSE THE LATTER WRIHT SO IN THE TWO MOST BASIC BEHAVIOURS WE HAVE WE FOLLOW OUR NOSE NOT OUR EYES RIHT TEN I NOT ALWAYS IN PREDICTIBLE WAYS BECAUSE YOU OFFERED AN EXTREME EXAMPLE WHICH IS THE BEST EXAMPLE BUT I FOR INSTANCE FOR REASONS I DON'T KNOW I'VE NEVER LIKE THE SMELL OF PERFUME EVER IN FACT I FIND IT AVERSIVE BUT I DO I CONFESS I DO LIKE THE SMELL OF CERTAIN BODY ODERS VERY MUCH AND I'M VERY UN PARTICULAR ABOUT THAT AND I KNOW WITHIN AN INSTANT UM AND SO A THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR ANY ROMANTIC PARTNER A WHO LIKES PERFUME FOR ME AN I KNOW MANY PEOPLE LIKE PERFUMES AND COLONES AND THINGS THAT LIWER AND ANERNESS I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD AM THAT A BY SOME ONE THAT THEY COULDN'T SPEND TIME WITH ME BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LIKE MY SMELL IN FACT THEY DISLIKE IT AND I AND FORTUNATELY FOR ME THERE'S AT LEAST ONE PERSON ON THE PLANET WHONA AS  A WHOSO E AM SO I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING U I CAN ALSO SAY THAT UM I IMPRINTED ON THE SMELL OF MIDABLE DOG MASTIFF UM WHEN THEY RAISE FROM THE TIME HE WAS A PUPPY AND I IMPRINTED ON I IMPRINTED ON HIS SMELL IMMEDIATELY AND EVEN THOUGH TO OTHER PEOPLE HE WAS BLE DOG MASTIFF AFTER ALL HIS SMLL WITH HWAS RATHER AVERSIVE TO ME HE HE SMELLED DELICIOUS RIGHT I AND A ANYTHING IT SMELLED LIKE HOME AND HE WAS MY BEST ANIMAL FR  RADALONG TA SO AND ON AND ON AND ON WRITE THE SMELL OF CHILDREN AS YOU SAID THE BACK  WE HAD A GUEST ON THIS POTGES TO IMSURE YOUR FAMILI CHARLES LOOKER A PROFESSOR COLUMBIA HAS DONE INCREDIBLE WOR IN VISION  A THIRSTSENSIN AND HE AND I TALKED LI IT ABOUT THIS THAT UM THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE GREATH OF ROMANTIC PARTNERS UM THAT'S HOPEFULLY A PETITIVE NOT AVERSIVE AS WELL AS IN CHILDREN HE WAS TALKING THAT THE SMELL OF HIS GRANDCHILD THE BAT THE NAPE OF THEIR N THE BACK OF THEIR NECK AND HOW HE MISSES THAT SMELL BES WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT MISSING HIS GRANDCHILD OR CHILDREN IT'S THAT SMELL THAT THAT THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THAT FILLING HEXA DECANAL HEXA DECANAL YES IS AT CHARLES A YOUR GRAND CHILDREN SMELL LIKE HEXA DECANAL YES GETTEVEN AFTER ME NOW ANTTHIS THIS IS A SEDY A RAN BY A IVAMISURE A WHO WAS A GRADUTION IN OUR LAP AM AND AND IVA WAS INTERESTED IN AGGRESSION SHE WAS REALLY INTO AGRESSION AM AND ACTUALLY WHEN SHE START AN AN ENSIH WHEN SHE START OFF WE SO KEEPLETS TO KEEM A SIGNALING OF AGGRESSION SHE ACTUALLY WAS GOING LIKE EMIMA CLUBS AND COLLECTING BODY ODORS AH AND WEWE HAD ALL SORTS OF IDEAS GOING AND ANCHISCHI WORKED ON THAT QUETIBIT IT NEVER WENT ANYWHERE REALLY AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD A COLLEAGUE OF OURS A FROM GERMANY I MEAN MY SA COLLIGU PRIMARLY A FRIEND AR ACQUAINTANCE I MENT AT CONFERENCES AM HINDS BREER AM AND AN NAM HE WAS STUDYING IN HIS LAB A MOLECULE HEXADECANAL AM THAT WAS A CIM SIGNAL IN MICE WERE IN MICE IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A CIMO SIGNAL THAT PROMOTES SOCIAL BUFFERING WERE SOCIAL BUFFERING AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT MY FIELD BUT AS FIR AS I UNDERSTAND ITS BASICALLY A FEEL GOOD TOGETHER A THING SO WHEN LOTS OF MICE ARE TOGETHER THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT BEING IN A GROUP AND THAT SOCIAL BUFFERING AND IT'S PROMOTED BY HEXADECANAL WHICH THEY OMIT IN THEIR FISIES MICE AND IN HIS WORK ON HEXDECANAL AM AND EN SSO SO BREER AND HIS COLIC SORTSMEN THEY THEY DISCOVERED THE RECEPTER FOR THIS AND THEN THEY WENT AND DISCOVERED THAT THE RECEPTOR IS VERY HIGHLY CONSERVED U THROUGHOUT MAMELIAN EVOLUTION AND THEREFORE THEY HYPOTHESIZED THAT MAY BE A THIS IS A UNIVERSAL MAMELIAN SIGNAL NOW WHICH IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE IN IN CIMO SIGNALING TYPICALLYTEN TO THINK OF THINGS AS BEING VERY SPECIE SPECIFIC BUT HERE THEY HYPOTHESIZED THAT MAY BE HEXADECANAL WHICH PROMOTE SOCIAL BUFFERING IN MICE MAY DO SOMETHING IN ALL MAMALS AGAIN BECAUSE THIS RECEPTOR IS VERY HIGHLY CONSERVED O OUR THIRTY SEVEN B I THINK AM SO THEY SO HE APPROACHED US AND SAID LOOK YOU GOT A STUDY THE STUFF IN HUMANS RIGHT BECAUSE HE KNOWS US IS THE HUMAN PEOPLE ALL RIGHT I MEAN WE GO TO THESE ALL FACTION COM FEANCES WERE WE'RE LOTS OF PEOPLE STUDY MICE AND AND ENZEBRAFISH AND WHAT NOT N WETHER THE HUMAN GROUP SO AND AN EVENTUALLY HE JUST TEDIC TUS HEXA DECANAL AND AND SO WE HAVE THIS THING SITTING AROUND AND EVA WAS NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH HER AGGRESSION STUDIES WITH SWEAT FROM HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND YET SHE BUILT THE ENTIRE A POWRADINE TO STUDY HUMAN AGGRESSION SO THEY'RE STANDARD PARADIMES THIS IS A POWER DI'ME KNOWING AS THE TAP THE TYLER AGGRESSION PARADINE I'LL SOON DESCRIBE IT AND SO WE SAID ACAME WE HAVE THE TEXA DE CANAL STUFF HERE AND IT PROMOTE SOCIAL BUFFERING SOCIAL BUFFERING SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD MAKE YOU LESS AGGRESSIVE WHY DON'T YOU RUN YOUR TAP EXPERIMENT USING HEXIDECANAL WHAT'S THE TAP EXPERIMENT SEBASICALLY WHAT YOU DO IS YOU BRING IN A PARTICIPANT TO LAB AND YOU HAVE THEM A THINKING THAT THEY'RE CAN BE PLAYING AGAINST ANOTHER PERSON AND IN THIS GAME AND YOU CAN YOU CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE HAVE ANOTHER PERSON WALK INTO THE OTHER ROOM PLAYING ON LINE SO T SO CONNECTID SO YOU CAN FOOL THEM INTO BEING QUITE CONVINCE THAT THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THEY GO INTO THEIR OWN ROOM AND IND THE INITIAL GAME THEY PLAY I'M ON EACH ROUND THERE A THEY'RE PROVIDED WITH A SUM OF MONEY AND THIS IS REAL MONEY THATHEY'LL RECEIVE AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT AND BY TURN EACH ONE OF THEM DECIDES HOW TO DIVIDE THE MONEY UP BETWEEN THE TWO RIHT O THEY'RE PLAYING AGAINST ANOTHER PERSON THEY THINK BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY A COMPUTERALGARA THEM HAT THEY'RE PLAYING AGAINST AND THE COMPUTER ALGAR THEM IS IS PROGRAME TO BE IN INSIDE TOFIC TERMINOLOGY A JERK RIGHT SO THAT YOU KNOW LIKE THAT SAY TH HAVE TO DIVY UP A HUNDRED CHECKEL WHICH IS THE ISRAELICCARENCY SO SO THE COM OF THE OTHER PLAYER WOULD TE OKE YOU KNOW I'LL KEEP NINETY SIX AND YOU GET FOR RIGHT AND THEN IF YOU CAN EITHER ACCEPT IT OR NOT ACCEPTIN THE NEITHER OF YOU GET ANYTHING RIGHT SO BASICALLYOU'RE BEING SHAFTED BY BY THE OTHER SIDE ALL THE TIME AND THIS IS CALLED THE PROVOCATION PASE YOU'RE REALLY GETTING ANGRY AT THIS PERSON BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY NOT NICE RIGHT THRTHEY'RE SHAFTING YON EVERY TRIAL OR ALMOST AND YOU PLAY THIS GAME AN AND IT GOES TO ITS END AND THEN YOU PLIT YOU PLAY A SECOND GAME AS FAR AS YOU KNOW AGAINST THE SAME PARTICIPANT AND THE SECOND GAME IS A REACTION TIME GAME SO A TARGET CHOSE UP AND THE FIRST TO PRESS IT WINDS AND ON EVERY TRIAL WHERE YOU WIN IF YOU WANT YOU CAN BLAST THE OTHER PARTS ISPENT WITH A LOUD NOISE AND AND IT'S A REALLY LOUD NOISE SO YOU'RE ALSO WEARING YOUR FONDS IT'S NINETY D B AND IT'S IT'S A SCREECHING HORRIBLE SOUND IT'S THE MOST PUNISHMENT THAT AN IARBY COMMITTEE WILL LET YOU AN ENDUREON ON A PARTISMENT AN EXPERIMENT UNLESS YOU'RE ON STANDFORD SEVENTY YEARS AGO WHATEVER THAT WAS NOW IS I IO TE  TE CLASSIC   EREPAR WE PLACE IN THE I E TER T WE WEN WE SO YOU CAN BLAST THE OTHER PARTS TOSPENT WITH VERY LEVELS OF SOUND AND YOU HAVE A SELECTION BOX FROM SOMETHING VERY LOW TO SOMETHING VERY HIGH AND WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THIS IS IT THEN ALLOWS YOU TO QUANTIFY AGGRESSION BECAUSE THE MORE VOLUME YOUR BLASTING THE OPPONENT WITH THE MORE GRESSIVE YOU ARE TOWARDS YOUR OPPONENT AND AND SYOU HAVE A MEASURE OF AGGRESSION AGAIN THE TYLOR AGGRESSION PARADIME OBVIOUSLY INVENTED BY TYLOR AVERY WELL VALIDATED STUDIED ALL OVER YOU KNOW A A VERY STANDARD PROTOCOL SO AWE BROUGHT IN PARTISPENCE AND HAD THEM PLAY A THE TYLER OF THE TAP AEITHER UNDER EXPOSURE TO HEXT A DECANEL OR CONTROL NOW EXIDECANAL DOESN'T IT'S IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULTY EVEN DETECT TECT A DECANEL BUT JUST IN CASE ABECAUSE IT'S NOT VERY ITS CONSIDER A SEMIPHOLATILE IT DOESN'T HAVE A STRONG SMELL BUT WE BURIED IT BOTH THE CONTROL AND THE IDECANAL AND IN A A CONTROL ORDER THAT HID THEM IN A MASK AND AND SHE RAN LOTS AND OTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF PARTS ISPENCE MEN AND WOMEN AND I'LL FORST ELL YOU THE RESULT WITH MEN WHICH IS THAT HEXADECANAL CONSISTENTLY REDUCED AGGRESSION PEOPLE WERE LESS AGGRESSIVE UNDER HEXADICANAL A THE EFFECTSIZE WAS WAS A A QUITE MEANING FULL AND LATER ON WE LEARNED BECAUSE I'M NO SPECIALIST IN THE WORLD OF AGGRESSION BUT COMPARED TO EFFECT SEEN IN THE AGGRESSION WORLD N IN RESEARCH REALLY REALLY STRONG EFFECTS SO UNUSUALLY STRONG SO HEX DECANAL LOWERD AGGRESSION AND MEN AND WE WERE LIKE QUOL THIS IS YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT WE WERE HOPING TO TOSEE CONSISTENT WITH HE HYPOTHESIS A AND CONSISTENT WITH IT SEEMS TO DO IN MICE BUT THEN WE LOOKED AT THE DATA FROM WOMEN AND HEXA DECANAL INCREASED AGGRESSION EQUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY IS THIS TOUHT TO BE SOMETHING RELATED TO MATERNAL PROTECTIVE NOS GETTING THERE SO YOU YOU A GOT THEIR REALLY FAST IT TOOK ME A YEAR BUT AND AND N EV I GOT TO IT REALLY ILT ALL I'LL TELL YOU BECAUSE WE REMEMBER WERE REACHING THE BACK OF THE HEAD OF YOUR OF O A WHOSE WAS IT A GRANDCHILDREN ARS OTEGERSTO TE ASHAL DE AE ONE OF THE KINGPINS OF THE NEW YORK NEROSIENCE MAFLIA YES SO A SO THIS WAS REALLY ODD TO ME AT THAT TIME D SO I DIDN'T HAVE THE INTUITION YOU JUST HAD AND I WAS LIKE IVA THIS THERE WAS SOME BUG HERE I'M IN THIS THIS IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME OU KNOW WHY WOULD SOMETHING INCREASE AGGRESSION IN WOMEN AND DECREASED AGGRESION IN MEN THIS IS REALLY REALLY STRANGE AND AND ASIDOCAT I WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN BEFORE YOU KNOW WE GO AHEAD WITH THIS SO SHE WENT INTO THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT AGAIN AND THIS TIME SHE DID WITHIN THE EFEMOROI MAGNET SO THAT WE WE CAN ALSO A TRACK A BRAIN ACTIVITY ON WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING AND FIRST OF ALL IT REPLICATED AGAIN SO ONCE AGAIN A HEXADECANAL MEN MADE MEN LESS AGGRESSIVE AND WOMEN MORE AGGRESSIVE AND AN AND THE EXTENT OF MORE THAN THE EFFECT ALONE THE DISSOCIATION WAS REMARKABLE THIS HAS IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CROMAS ALMOL TEST I MEAN YOU LOOK AT THE DATE ON THE UNIT UNIT SLOPE LINE AND ALL ALL THE MEN ARE ABOVE A BELOW AND ALL THE WOMEN ARE ABOVE THOG THERE'S A FIGURE IN THE PAPER THEN SH SHE ALSO LOOKED AT THE BRAIN DATE AND N THIS IS YOU KNOW ALALTHOUGH OUR LAB DOES AHUNOF EFEMARI IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR TOOLS WE USED TO MEASURE A A BRAIN ACTIVITY I'M I'M I'M QUITE COGNIZANT OF THE LIMITATIONS OF EFEMRIN AND AND THIS IS I THINK SADLY I THINK THE ONLY STUDYING MY CURY AT LEAST WHERE WERE ACTUALLY MANAGED TO ALSO GET A MECHANISM OUT OF EFEMRI NOT ONLY AN AREA THAT'S INVOLVED IN ACTIVITY AND AND SO HERS WHAT WE SAW THAT HEXIDECANAL ALONE INCREASED ACTIVITY QUITE PRONOUNCELY IN AN AREA OF THE BRAIN KNOWN IS THE LEFT ANGULAR GIRISTS NOW THIS IS AN ARYA INVOLVED AND WHAS REFERRED TO A SOCIAL APPRAISAL SO THAT WAS KIND OF COOL IN THAT A SOCIAL ORDER ACTIVATED THE SOCIAL BRAIN NOT THE FACTORY SYSTEM PERSAY AND AND VERY PRONOUNCED SO ON ONE HAND THAT WAS COOL BUT THEN WHAT WAS UNCOOL WAS THAT IT DID THE SAME IN MEN AND WOMEN AND THIS WAS IN CONTRAST TO BEHAVIOR WHICH YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING RIGHT I ME BECAUSE YOU WOULD EXPECT BRAIN ACTIVITY REFLECT BEHAVIOR AND IT INCREASED ACTIVITY IN THE LEFT ANGERLEGE IRIS AN BOTH BOTH MEN AND WOMEN BUT THEN SHE DID TO FOLLOW UP ANALYSIS WHICH WAS LOOK AT WHAT'S REFERRED TO HIS FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY THAT IS HOW DOES THIS REGION OF THE BRAIN TALK WITH THE ENTIRE BRAIN AS IT WERE UNDER HEXIDECANAL VERSES O CONTROL AND HERE THE DISSOCIATION REEMERGED POWERFULLY WHEREBY THE CONNECTIVITY FROM THE ANGULAR GIRIST WAS MOSTLY TO THE CLASSIC NERAL SUBSTRATES OF AGGRESSION TO THE MIGDELLA AND THE TEMPORAL POL AND THE CONNECTIVITY WENT IN OPPOSITE DIRECSIONS IN MEN AND WOMEN SO HEXA DECANAL INCREASED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN MEN IN DECREASED IT IN WOMEN SO IN A WAY THIS IS ALMOST SAYING THAT THE DEFAULET BRAIN REACTION IS AGRESSION RIGHT THE DEFAULT IS TO AGGRESS AND IN MEN HEXA DECANAL INCREASES THE CONTROL THAT THE LEFT ANGLATIRIS IS HOLDING OVER YOUR AGGRESSION AND IN KEEPING YOU BACK AND IN WOMEN IT LET IT ROOAM FREE AND THEY BECAME MORE AGGRESSIVE BUT I WAS STILL APOSTLE SOSO SO I WAS CONVINCED THIS HAPPENED TWICE THE EMARL DATA PROVIDED NOT ONLY A PATTERN BUT A MECHANISM WHICH IS UNUSUAL AND YET I I WAS TELLING YE WHAT YOU KNOW BUT IT OTHERS MAKES NO SENSE TO ME AND THEN AND THEN HER INSIDE WHICH OF COURSE AFTERWARDS IS LIKE TA IT IS NOW THERE IS A PLACE WHERE THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND THAT IS IF YOU WERE A MAMILIAN OFFSPRING BECAUSE PATERNAL AGGRESSION IS OFTEN DIRECTED AT YOU THERE IS INFANTICIDE ALL OVER AND SADLY THEREIS MALE AGGRESSION TOWARDS HUMAN CHILDREN AS WELL AND MATERNAL AGGRESSION IS OFTEN PROTECTIVE SO IF YOU ARE AN OFFSPRING IF YOU HAVE A MOLECULE THAT WILL MAKE YOUR MOTHER MORE AGGRESSIVE IN YOUR DADDY LESS AGGRESSIVE BOTH OF THOSE ARE GOOD FOR YOU SO YOUARE WINNING SO WE REMEMBER A RECENTLY PUBLISHED PAPER FROM A GRUP IN JAPAN THIT LOOKED AT THE ODERS EMANATING FROM BABY HEADS WE NOW COME FULL CIRCLE TO CIRCURS GRANDCHILDREN THEY USED A METHOD KNOWN AS G C AMS GASCOMATARIPU MASPECTROMETRY A TO MEASURE THE VOLATILES FROM BABY HEADS BECAUSE BABY HEAD ODOR IS A CULTURAL THING ACROSS CULTURERS EVEN IN JAPAN AND SO WE QUICKLY WENT TO THAT PAPER AND TO SEE IF ONE OF THE MOLECULES THAT REPORT IS HEXIDECANAL AND WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WASN'T ONE OF THE MOLECULES THAT REPORTED IN THE PAPER AND SO WE WE WROTE TO THE AUTHORS WHO ARE SINCE THEN ARE COAUTHORS A AND WE SAID LOOK YOU KNOW WERE STUDYING A THE MOLECULE EXIDECANON WE DON'T SEENOUR RESULTS AND AND WE WERE WONDERING MAYBE YOU HAD SOME RESULTS THAT YOU DIDN'T PUBLI ASSURE SOME SUPPLEMENTARY TILS OR WHATEVER AND AT THIS LAP WHICH IS A HARD WORG S LAPS AD NO NO HEXA DECANALS A SEMI VOLATILE WHICH WE KNEW A AND OUR PREVIOUS PAPER WAS NOT DIRECTED TO THE SEMIVOLATILE RANGE BUT WE CAN NOW DO USE WHAT'S CALLED G C X G C DOUBLE G S THAT A IS DIRECTED AT SEMIVOLTAS AND CAN DO THIS AGAIN WE JUST A STUDIED O LEVIN BABIES AND WE CAN WE CAN SEE IF THE SIS NESIO SOSITY A PLEASE DO A THE BOTTOM LINE OF ALL THIS IS THAT HEXADECANELS THE MOST ABUNDANT SEMIVOLATILAND BABY HEADS IT'S TONS OF IT COMING OUT BABY HEATS SO BABIES AGAIN SPEAKIN ABOUT A FUMANS TO ARDON KUMUSING OL BABIES ARE CONDUCTING CHEMICAL WARFARE RIGHT THEYRE THERE THERE YOU KNOW PREDUCING AGGRESSION AN THEIR FATHERS OR MALES AROUND THEM AND INCREASING AGGRESSION AN THEIR MOTHERS OR FEMALES AROUND THEM AND BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOOD FOR THEM INCREDIBLE THIS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AM AND YET SIMILAR IN OTHER WAYS A BECAUSE IT'S A BUILT OFF OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE MUD ITS ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT YOU HEAR ALL THE TIME AND YET WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AT LEAST BY MY READ THE DATA ARE NOT CLEAR MAYBE EVEN CONTRADICTORY AND THAT RELATES TO THE CORDINATION OF MENSTRUAL CSYCLES AMONG COHOUSED E WOMEN WERE WOMEN WHO ARE FRIENDS THE O MANY WOMEN LISTENING TO THIS THE MAYBE SOME MEN WHO ARE AWARE OF OF THIS EFFECT WILL SAY OH YA ABSOLUTELY WHEN I SPEND TIME WITH MY FRIENDS OR GO AWAY CAMPING OR EVEN SPEND A DAY WITH THEM OUR MENSTRUAL CSYCLES BECOME CORDINATED HOWEVER MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE EARLY LITERATURE BARBARAM CLINTA CORRECT AM DISCOVER THIS PHENOMENON PUBLISH A PAPER IN SCIENCE AS AN UNDERGRADUATE AND EN SEVENTY ONE NATURE AMAZING NATURE THA PAPER AGAIN ONE OF THE THREE APEXTERNALS AND AS AN UNDERGACE FANTASTIC SO DISCOVER THIS DESCRIBE THAS AND A PROBABLY WOMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO BECAME AWARE OF THIS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BY PROBABLY SAID YES ABSOLUTELY THIS GIVES VALIDATION TO WHAT WE OBSERVED AHOVER AN OVERAN AND YET AS SUBSEQUENT PAPERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED THIS RESULT HAS BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION IS IS THERE ANY A FINAL WORD ON WHETHER OR NOT MENSTRUAL CYCLES A BECOME CORDINATED AMONG WOMEN WHO SPEND TIME TOGETHER AND IF SO IS THERE ANY ROLL OF OFACTION IN THIS A WORK A CUMO SENSING THROUGH THE NOSTRILS ONM AND ER MOUTH A TO SUPPORT THIS IDEA SO SO YA SO SESROV INDEED TO ECHO A THE BACKGROUND IS THAT THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY BY MARTHA MC CLINTOCK WHEN SHE WAS AN UNDERGRADUATED WESLIAN COLLEGE A AND SHE NOTICED THAT SHE THOUGHT HER MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND AND HER COINHABITANTS IN HER DORNROOM AM AM WERE CORDINATED IN TIME AM AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THIS COMES ON THE BASIS OF SIMILAR OR RELATED TYPE AFFECTS IN RUDENCE NO RUIN SON HAVE A MENSTRUAL CYCLE LIKE HUMANS DO A BU BUT AM THERE'S A AN AFFECTIN RUINCSE REFRTOS THE WITTEN EFFECT WHICH AM RESEMBLES A THIS TYPE OF OF OF EFFECT M AND SHE PUBLISHED INDEED THAT PAPERS AN UNDERGRADUATE N NATURE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SHE PUBLISHED TO FOLLOW UP IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ALSO IN NATURE A WITH THEN HER GRADUATES IN CHICAGO A STERN SO THIS IS STERN AND MC CLINTOCK NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND HERE'S WHAT THEY DID THEY A COLLECTED AM SWEAT FROM DONER WOMEN AND DEPOSITED IT ON THE UPPER LIP OF RECIPIENT WOMEN SO THIS WOULD BE A FUNE EXPERIMENT FOR YOU AT LEAST WEEKS WE SAID YOU LIKE BODY ORDERUS BUT FOR MANY OTHERS PERHAPS IT WOULD BE DAUNT ING WHI LI AS CERTAIN  BODY ORDERS FROM CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL  A  I DON'T I DON' THINK I UNIFORMLY LIKE ALL BY YOURS ALTHOUGH I DO I UNIFORMLY NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF PERFUME ALTHOUGH I SOU JUST DECLARE BY THAIS OT THER AN IEAR IN THE HARDWAY COMMERCATION OF INTO SOME OF THOSE PERFUMES I FIND DOWNRIGHT AVERSIVE E LIKE ITSAT A I THINK THE GREAT MARKETS MYSTER  GREAT NOR BY ALES NN TH OTHER'S BASELIC THREE RESPONSITS TO EITHER YUG YAC OR MET SO SOME I AR TRUE I NEVER HEARD THAT  A N INTER ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR  RAITHER ERN ARA OR  TT ORD PAUSE A SO SOME ARE TRULY A YACH SOME MANY ARE MET ZERO TO DATE OR YUM FOR ME NOW BODY ORDERS THE DISTRIBUTION IS SHIFTED IT COULD BE ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE YUMG YACOR MET SO JUS TO BE CLEAR BUT THEY THE A YUMG CATEGORY IS DEFINITELY INCLUDED SAY FOR FOR A ASO A A SO SO SHEDED THE STUDY SO SO BECAUSE RIGT IN THE ORIGINAL MC LINTOC STUDY YOU MIGHT SUSPECT OTHER A DRIVERS OF THE EFECTEVEILITY WIX YOU ACCEPT THE EFFECT BUT STILL THERE MIGHT BE OTHER SOCIAL DRIVERS OF THE EFFECT THER ARE NO BODY ORTE WRIT ER MIGHT BE SOME DOMINANT WOMEN WHOSE DOMINANT IN SOME OTHER WAY AND THIS MIGHT BE DRIVING THE CORNATION RIGHT SO HERE THERE WAS NO DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THESE WOMEN OTHER THAN BODY ORDER SO IF THE EFFECT RE EMERGED A IT WOULD DEFINITLY BE ANA FACTORY EFFECT AND WHAT SHE FOUND IS THAT IF SHE TOOK A SWEAT FROM THE FOLICULAR OR THE AVILATORY APASE OF THE DONERS ONE ACTENDED THE CYCLE AND RECIPIENTS AND ONE SHORTEN THE CYCLE IN RECIPIENTS I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH WAS WHICH BUT BUT BASICALLY A A DEFINITELY DENOTING A A KIMO SIGNALING EFFECT A WITH WITH THE OPPOSING A A EFFECT ON DURATION BASED ON THE TIME IT WAS COLLECTED FROM AGAIN PUBLISHED IN NATURE IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THAT'S IT I I THAT THERE'S A A QUOTATION I THINK THIS IS FROM FROM MA FROM FROM MA I'M NOT SURE BUT BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT A A IF SOMETHING'S PUBLISHED IN A NATURE OR SCIENCE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S NOT TRUE SO A WITH THAT IN MIND IM THE FINDINGS WERE SINCE CALLED INTO QUESTION WUITE WIDELY IM ONE REASON IS JUST STATISTICS OF SICLIC EVENTS ARE SURPRISINGLY COMPLICATED SO SO IT'S TRICKY IT'S ONCE YOU HAVE A SYCLIC EVENTS TISTATISTICS BECOME TRICKY AND ANSOSHU MARTHA TOOK A LOT OF HEAT ON THE STATISTICS OF OF CLAIMING AN EFFECT AND I THINK THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE EFORT OF REPLICATION THAT DIDNT REALLY WORK OUT IM IF YOU ASKED ME I'M ON THE FENCE SO I AND BUT I'M ITMAY BE IN A MINORITY IN MY FIELD I THINK AA MAJORITY IN THE FIELD IS CURRENTLY NEGATIVE I'M NOT I AND I'VE WE'VE SAID IN LAB THAT WE SHOULD DO A PLANNED REPLICATION IM WE WILL IT'S  AGAIN IT'S A HORRIBLE STUDY TO RUN IT'S TINS OF WORK IND IN IT AND YOU HAVE TO RUN IT FOR REALLY LONG TIME A AND AND NA SO ITS COMPLETELY NON TRIVIAL A BUT WE HAVE GRADUSN NOW AND LAB INTERESTED IN THESE EXACT THINGS A RUDE WISE GROSSENCE AND SHE'S DOING SIMILAR STUFFAN AND I HOPE WE WILL DO THAT I HOPE WE WILL TRY TO TO REPLICATE THIS IM VERY INTERESTING RESULT AND I THINK AINTERESTING BECAUSE OF ITS U REAL WORLD A MEANING OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY OF COURSE OUR EXPERIMENT ANALOGUE BUT ALSO BECAUSE FEREMONAFFECTS AND A FACTORY EFFECTS IN HUMANS SEEM UNIQUE AMONG A NURBIOLOGICAL SLASH ENDICRINE PHENOMENA BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE SO MANY STORIES THAT WE ALL HAVE OF THE SMELL OF OUR GRANDMOTHER'S HANDS OR THE RECOGNIZING THE SENT OF OF SOMEBODY OR I KNEW FROM THE MOMENT THAT  I SMELLED THEIR BRATH OR A YOU KNOW OR I JUST LIKED THEIR SMELL KIND OF THING THESE AR KIND OF THINGS THAT THAT INFORM THE THE DEEP POTENTIAL FOR A REAL BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON AS UPPOSED TO THE KIND OF THING LIKE O I YOU KNAY JUST THROW SOMETHING OUT THERE OXYTOSTAN IS BONNING AND AND ALLO A SUDDEN YOU KNOW THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC NOT AT NO TO NO FAULT TOF THEIR OWN COMES TO THINK THAT EVERY EVERY ASPECT OF BONDING IS IS OXYTOSAN AND EVERY DEFECT IN BONDING IS LACK OF OXYTOS AND BUT THE THE GENERAL PUBLICPROVIDES A SORT OF A RICH  IT'S VODER FOR FOR EXPLORING ALL THESE THINGS AND IN LOTTIMES THEY TURN OUT TO BE TRUE I  WOENN'T IN THE CONTEXABLE ACT YETNOITS IT'S A VERY PRIMAL SYSTEM YOU KNOW SO SOIDES ITS LINK TO THE MOST YOU KNOW LIMBIC PRIMAL MECHANISMS IN OUR BRAIN AND IT DRIVES PRIMAL BEHAVIOR IT' IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SYSTEM I I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT A PARTICULAR STUDY BUT I'M JUST GOING A CUIT UP AND YOU'LL KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT IM I'M CEWING UP UM AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ODORS AND HORMONES AND IN PARTICULAR CRYING AS I POINTED OUT PREVIOUSLY THE THE SOUT OF FLAVOR OF THE MONTH AND INHUMAN SOCIAL CUMO SIGNALING RESEARCHES THE SMELL OF FER AND THE THE MEDIA OF THE MONTH A SWEAT WRITES O SO AM THE THE FEW MAYBE TENS OF BLABS IN THE WORLD THAT STUDY A HUMAN SOCIAL CUMO SIGNALLING ALL COLLECTS SWEAT AND AND THAT'S THE MEDIA AH THEY LOOK AT IS IT ALWAYS FROM THE ARN THAT WOR AS THERE ARE THER MEANING FUL DIFFERENCES IN FRMS THE SWEAT MITTED FEROM DIFERENT LOCATIONS ON THE BODY I ALREAHT KNOW THE ANSWER THAT AS I ASK IT BUT LET YOU STAY ABOVE THE WAST LINE AND AM IKNONO YES IT SOER BELOW THEWAST LINE OF A WE'RE BIOLOGIST AFTER ALL WE WE YESOITS IT'S FUNNY WE WE WE HAVE WERE WORKING N A PAPER ON THAT RIGHT NOW I ON THE SMELL OF FEAR AH SO ISO WE HAVE A NICE PARADINE FOR A GENERATING FEAR WE THROW PEOPLE OUT OF AIR PLANES IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO GENERA HAN TO COME TO YOUR LAB I TY THE GRAN E HAVIN THERDU WE WE DIDN'T INVENT THAT BY THE WAY I THE FIRST TO DO THAT WAS A AND I HOPE ON PRONOUNCING HER NAME CORRECTLY I THINK ITS MUJIKA PE RUDI AM BUT BADAM THAT'S OUR PARADINE FOR GENERATING FEAR AND WE STARTED THAT ON OUR OWN BUT A WE'VE SINCE ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION WITH THE IS RALLY PARTRIPER'S BRIGADE AND WE NOW COLLECT BODY ODER FROM EVERY FIRST TIME JUMPER SO AM WE WE WENT THAT PATH BECAUSE WE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS FIELD YOU KNOW THAT THE HOLY GRAIL THERE IS IS FINDING THE MOLECULES RIGHT I MEAN I FEU'LL HAVE THE FEAR MOLECULES THAT'S  BANANZA RIGHT BECAUSE I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU COUL THINK OF MANY REASONS WHY WOULD BE A BANANZA BUT FOM YENO IF IF YOU FIND THE MOLECULES YOUYOU CAN THEN FIND FIND THE RECEPTERS AND WHEN YOU FIND THE FOGNA RECEPTRS YOU CAN THEN DEVELOP WACKERS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU KNOW A MA AM WHAT'S THE TERMONE FOR AM M SWICHING ITO HE BREW IT'S ABOUT MIDNIGHT NOWR I AM AM SORRY OYA YARNING YOU DONT IN CRATABLY HON CONSIDERING  NEVERI THES MORNING  WE WOULD NEVER KNOW EA AHADIN TO DAY FROM ISRAEL SO HE'S AT HESAS CIRCATIAN INVERTED AS WE SA AH AMANXIETY SO SO A YOU CAN IMAGINE DEVELPING LIKE A NAZAL SPRAY AGAINST ANXIETY RIGHT WERE WERE YOU WOULD QUELL THOSE RECEPTERS AND KILL THE FURESPONSE RIGHT WHICH RATHER THAN GOING TO CARN PATH WHICH IS THROUGH R TRANSMITTERS THAT THEN HAVE EFFECTS ALL OVER THE PLACE YOU WOULD BE GETTING FEAR AT ITS SORCE RIGHTS O  THAT WOULD BE WHY I WOULD WANT THAT AND AND AND WE FORGET OUT THE DOING THAT YOU KNOW COLLECTING FEAR LIKE THREE FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE A IN AN EXPERIMENT YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO ANOLITICAL CHEMISTRY ON THAT SO WE NOW HAVE A W WE HAVE A A SETTING WE CALL FEAR BANK A WHICH NOW HAS MORE THAN A THOUSAND SAMPLES IN IT SO WERE TRYING TO DO A AANALYTICS ON THAT BUT BUT IN DOING THAT WE WEE JOIND YOU KNOW THAT THE CROWD EVERYBODY IS DOING FEAR AND EVERYBODYIS DOING SWEAT AND IN ONE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS AND LAB YOU KNOW ER SAYING WHELE THERE'S GON A BE MOU KNOW OR THEIR POTENTIALLY DIFFIRLY COULD BE ADDITIONAL BODILY MEDIA THAT ARE OUR PLAIN TO SOCIAL KEEMO SIGNALING A NOW MANY OF THESE YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY STUDY YOU RIGHT I MEAN SO YOU KNOW JUST TO THROW IT WHAT MOST TERRESTIAL MAMALS COMMUNICATE SOCIL INFORMATION THROUGH URINE A BUT YOU KNOW STARTING DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH HUMANS WITH SMELLING URAND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT YOU KNOW BOTH IN O OUR B AND AN AGREEMENT AND YOU KNOW AND AND THEN WE WE WE I KNOW THIS IS A RARE CASE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HYPOTHESIZED WHAT WE SAW TO DO AND  NCED ONLY CLAIM IN RETROSPECTHAT IT WAS HYPOTHESIS AH IS IS TEERS ON WWE WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT TEARS AND LOOKING INTO TEARS BECAUSE TEARS ARE BODILY LIQUID EMOTIONAL TIERS THAT THAT WE ADMIT IN EMOTIONAL SITUATIONS WHERE WERE THESE ARE SITUATIONS WERE NON VERBAL COMMUNICATIONIS IS CRITICAL AND KEY AND AND TEARS ARE LIQUID THAT THAT IS PUZZLING BEYOND OCULAR MAINTENANCE RAN AND SO SO YOU KOW THE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL TEXT I THINK TILL THIS DAY AND IN IN EMOTION RESEARCHES IS DARWIN'S BOOK HAH THE SHWING OF THE EMOTIONS AND MAN AND ANIMALS I THINK IS THE FULL NAME OF THE BOOK AND AN ENTIRE CHAPTER CHAPTER SIX IS DEVOTED TO TEARS AN ENTIRE CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK WHY WE WITH NO CONCLUSION WHY BECAUSE THE BOOK REVOLVES AROUND DESCRIBING THE FUNCTIONAL ANTICIDANCE OF EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE A SHOWING OF THE TEETH AS A SIGN OF AGGRESSION WRITES SO SO ANIMALS FIRST BIT WITH THEIR TEETH AND AND DARIN ARGUED THE THREVOLUTION A JUST A SHOWING THE TEETH ALONE BECAME AN AGGRESSIVE SIGN BECAUSE IT STARTED FROM BITING OR WHAT I I FIND AS IT IS A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE IN THIS WORK PARTLY DONE BY BY ADAM ANDERSON NOU AT CERNEL IM IS IS THE A EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION OF DISGUST SO DISGUST WHICH COMES FROM ONE DISGOZY A DISTASTE RIGHT IS SPINNING SOMETHING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH NOW WHAT WHAT ADAM SHOW IT IS IS THAT THE MUSCULARTRPATTERNS OF ACTIVATION AND THE TEMPORAL SEQUENCE OF ACTIVATION WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE MORAL DISGUST ARE THE SAME AS WHEN YOU PIT OF BITTER TASTE OUT OF YOUR MOUTH WRITES SO AGAIN SO THERE IS A FUNCTIONAL ANTICIDANT SPINNING SOMETHING OUT AND THROUGH REVOLUTION THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT IT BECAME AN EXPRESSION OF EMOTION AND YOU EXPRESS DISGUST JUST AS IF YOU ARE SPINNING SOMETHING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH EVEN THOUGH THERE YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF MORAL DISGUST THERE IS NOTHING YOU'RE SPINNING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH SO SO DARN SYSTEMATICALLY WENT THROUGH THE EXPRESSIONS OF EMOTIONS AND FOR EACH ONE WENT TO THEIR FUNCTIONAL ANTICIDANT AND EXPLAINED EVERYTHING VERY NICELY AND THEN HE GOT STUCK WITH TEARS RIGHT BECAUSE TEARS ARE AN OBVIOUSLY EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION AND HE COULD NOT FIND A FUNCTIONAL AR ANTICIDANT SO HE ENDED UP SAYING THAT THIS IS AN EPIC PHENOMEENA BASI CLY RIGHT I I DON'T IWHAT ALL SIENIS DO WHEN  HV AG  IM BLAME IT  NATURE RIT  SO SO BUT HE BOTHERED TO WRITE THIS ENTIRE CHAPTER ON ON ON THE OCULAR SORT OF MAINTENANCE COMMUOS FUNCTION OF TEARS AND SONSFR BUT BUT NOTHING EMOTIONAL SO WE THOUGHT WEL MAY BE THE FUNCTION IS IS A CHEMICAL SIGNAL AND AND YOU KNOW WITH THAT IN MIND WE WE HARVESTED EMOTIONAL TEARS AH WHICH WAS ALSO AN AMUSING EVENT ON ITS OWN RIGHT BECAUSE WE WE A WE AM WE WE POSTED UM MESSAGES ON ALL SORTS ABOARDS THAT THAT A WERE SEEKING AM EXPERIMENT PARTICIPANTS WHO CRY WITH EASE NOW THIS GENERATED AN UNFORTUNATE GENDER BY US IN OUR STUDY RIGHT BECAUSE WE RECEIVED T ABOUT A HUNDRED WOMEN VOLUNTEERS AND ABOUT ONE MAN AND YOU KOW I THINK THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM ONLY AND IN MOCHO ISRAEL RIGHT PROBABLY ANYWHERE IN THE WEST THIS WOULD AVING DEFLY IN AMERICA WOULD BE THE SAME HE MY GUESS IS THAT THERE PROBABLY MEN OUT THERE WHO CRY EASILY EMOTIONAL TEARS OH IAM SURE THERE'S NOTING A SHOW WELL YEA THATS I'M SAYING THAT  CULTURAL THING IT'S NOT YOU KNOWARE NOT GONGTO COME TO LABINTA A I CRY ALL THE TIME THIS HAS NOT GONETO HAPPEN AH AND THEN A WE WE WHAT WE DID IS OUT FOR EACH ONE OF THESE PARTICIPANTS YOU KNOW WE WOULD ASK THEM YOU KNOW AS THERE ARE PARTICULAR FILM EVENT THAT YOU KNOW OF THAT YOURE SEENG THAT IT MAKES YOU CRY AND AND INTERESTINGLY IN THESE EFFECTIVE CRIERS THERE IS AWAY OH YES YOU KNOW THE SCENE AND IN SO AND SO I ALWAYS CRY PROFUSELY FROM THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE LEARLY AN EXAMPLE OF A ONE OF THE MORE COMMONLY YANS AM IT WITHESE AM THE MOVY THE CHAMP THE CHAMMEL DIES HE'S A BOXER AND HE DIES AND IT LITERALLY IN THE HANDS OF HIS ABOUT EIGHT YEAR OLD SON AND HIS SON IS STANDING NEXT TO HIS BED AND YOU KNOW SAIN CHAMP CHAMP AND AND HE DIES RIGHT IT'S O WINNER MOGET HONORFALL THE A NSO E KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY THE NER BIOLOGY LAB WITH MOST SAD MOVY FILMS ON THOSE SHELLS IN THE WORLD RIGHT LIKE O A WHOLE COTUGE COLLECTION  STANDLING AS DEERS ON JOY AA I SO NO NO WELL WE'RE GOING HEAD OF OURSELVES LIKE US IF WE TRYD TO COLLECT THEM AND FAILED A EVEN PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY SHED TEARS OF DRAW AND LAUGHTER THEIR EYES WATER BIT BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME THING WITHA IN IN IN THE EFFECTIVE CRIERS WEND UP SCREENING SO I INRIT WE COLLECT A FULL M ELL OF TEERS A FULLE MELL OF TEERS IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES SO SO THAT'S PORING RAY AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN FROM LAUGHTER THAT WOR WE'VE NEVER HAING THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEND FROM O WE GROHT A SO SO A SO WE HAVE WE HAVE ALL THESE SAD FILMS AND BYLY ONE OF THE AMUSING THINGS IS AWHEN WE ULTIMATELY PUBLISHED THIS PAPER AND IN SCIENCE A WE WERE FORCED IN RETROSPECT TO GON ACTUALLY BUY THE FILMS RIGHT WE IMUREDY KNOW ORIGINALLY WE LIKE DOWNLOD  DIT WEAR THERE BUT YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOURE BE VIOLATING A AYOU KNOW AUR CONTGRARY LAWS RIGHT SO WE HAD TO BUY LIKE PURCHASE ALL THESE FILMS T THE PARTS AND WATCH THEM IT IS SO THO WE RE ACTUALLY HAVE THESE AND LAB LIKE DIVIDIES YU KNOW THAT WE ACTUALLY PURCHASE A BUT SOSO A HOVERAGE OF POTENTIAL LEGAL FALL A  NO NO WE DID I BERERELIELY S THATA SO WN  YET AND AND WHILE WE CAN TOUCH ON THAIT LATER BUT BUT AP SSO AM WE TOOK SO MOST OF THESE A A VOLUNTEERS WHO WHO COME SAYING THEY CAN CRY WITH EASE ACTUALLY DON'T MEET THE BILL A AND SO OUT OF THE BOUT HUNDRED AT LEST MORE WOMEN THAT WE SCREENED WE ENDED UP WITH ABOUT SIX WHO W COULD REALLY COME TO LAB WEEK AFTER WEEK AND PORTIERS THERE'S A NAME FOR THIS IN CYCHATRY THEY CALL IT A A NARRATIVE DISTANCING SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY WATCH A FILM WHERE SOME ONE'S GETTING HIT THEY THEY THEY THEY FLINCH QUITE A LOT THEY IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY'RE EXPERIENCING IT IT BUT IT WORSE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO I KNOW SOME ONE LIKE THIS A WHERE IF THEY WATCH A FILM THAT SOME ONE'S EXPERIENCING SOMETHING EVEN MILDLY POSITIVE THAT THEY'RE MOVED ELEVATE SO THEY THEY CAN QUICKLY BRIDGE EAM AND  IT'S NOT ALWAYS ADAPTIVE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE SO THERE'S LACK OF NARRATIVE DISTANCE IN RAT YE WHAT ONE OUR ISSUE YO CAN BRING UP WITH THE CENTARLON OF STUDIES OW LOBIS IS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE ABOUT THE DONERS RIGHT AND WERE ASSUMING THESE ARE TEARS AND NOTICE IS PRETTY COMMON I THINK THAT THE NUMBERS I SAUT A OUT THERE ABOUT FIVE TO EIGHT PER CENT IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE GOT ABOUT RENCHOT SIXSO TILL WE COLLECTED A AM TEARS AND AND WE EXPOSED A PARTICIPANTES A TO THESE TEARS AND AND WE FOUND A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL THE TEARS ARE COMPLETELY ODERLESS YOU CANNOT DETECT THEM AT ALL COMPLETELY ODERLESS M AND YET WHEN YOU SNIFF THEM YOU HAVE A PRONOUNCED A REDUCTION IN TESTHOSTERON A WITHIN ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES HALF AN HOUR THIS IS MEN AND WOMEN  SMELLING MANMINSTEARS HAS MEN DAILIK WOMEN'S TEARS BUT NOT PERCEIVING ANY ODOR NOTHING JUST SNIFFING THEM AND YOU HAVE A ABOUT A FOURTEEN PER CENT DROP IN FREETESTOSTRON FREE O CASE O THIS IS TESTOSTRONE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN LIBERATED FROM THE TESTES FREETONCE OR THET WE DONE A FEW WORMENTA THIT'S A EITHER BOUND OR UNBOUND IS UNBOUNCE YALMY AM FROM SIX ORM MINDING GLOGIN ET CETERA AND IT'S THE ACTIVE FORM SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S SUBJECT TO VERY SHORT TIME SGAL CHANGES YE AND AND THIS IS YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO WE STUDY TISTOSTRON WHICH IS NOT ME BUT THEY TELL ME THIS IS A REALLY STRONG EFFECT LIKE ITS IT'S HARDS EVEN FORMOCHOLOGICALLY GET AN EFFECT LIKE THAT THAT FAST I YEN KNOW INFORM ACOLOGY YET YEARS AGO ON TIME STUDYING INDECREN EFFECTS OF THIS SORT AMIN THAT'S A THE TREMENDOUS RESIZED AF FACT SO AND SO HERE A'LL POINT OUN PASSING A THAT AH WHAT ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD BECAUSE OF THE A EFFORT TO RUN THI STUDY IS THAT NOBODY WOULD EVER TRY TO REPLICATE IT AND TO OUR JOY ABOUT TWO YEARS LATER AN INDEPENDENT GROUP FROM A A SOUTH CAREE A OWE IT I'L I DON'T KNOW AT ALL A REPLICATED THE TISTOSTRONE EFFECT TO A T I MEAN LIKE SAME NUMBERS SO SO A IT IT LOWERS TISTOSTERON AND AN ANDWE THEN ALSO LOOKED A USING EM ARE AT THE AT THE A AM EFFECT ON BRAIN ACTIVITY AND SA PRONOUNCED A EF EFFECT ON ACTIVITY A DAMPENING A LOWERING OF ACTIVITY  UNDER UNDER A UNAROUSING STATE A LOWERING OF ACTIVITY A BOTH IN TH HIPPOTHOLEMIST AM AND IN THE FUSIFORM GIRIS FOR WHATEVER REASON I THOSE ARE RECOGNITIONARY AMONGST OTHER THINGS YES AM AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY A BUT PRONOUNCED AM AND CURRENTLY AM CHANIAR GROWIN IN OUR LAB IS REPLICATING THIS AGAIN AND THIS TIME A WITH A STRONGER BEHAVIOURAL COMPONENT AM AND I CAN SHARE WITH YOU A UNPUBLISHED A DATA NOW UNDER REVIEW AM THAT'S AS YOU WOULD EXPECT GIVEN THE EFFECT ON TISTOSTRON PERHAPS A SNIFFING TEARS LOWERS AGGRESSION IN MEANT AH USING AGAIN THE TAP THE SAME EXPERIMENT USED BY EVIN IN THE A EX AD ECONOMEXPERIMENT THE TATLY OUTEM TO THINK OF THAT IS THE THE SATIST THE TITOLGR SAID THE TITRATION N HE SATUST TITREYE THE TILOR A GRESSION PARADIZE SA NO O ONEOF THE MILGRIM EXPERIMENTS OF THE OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHICH POST A THIS WAS LOOKING AT SORT OF A POSTHAULACOST BEHAVIOR  YOU NOT PEOPLE BASICALLY TOR IN AMERICAN LABORATORIES THINKING THEY WERE TORTURING OTHER PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD TO AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DID THAT EVEN THOUGH MOST PEOPLWOULD REPORT THAT THEY WOULD NEVER TORTUROUS YEA NO HUMANS ARE NOT A WONDERFUL SPECIES ORS I THINK IT WAS THE THE GREAT CAR YOUNG SAID A WE HAVE ALL THINGS INSIDE OF US BUT AM A THE THE GOAL IS NOT TO EXPERIENCE THEM ALL CERTAINLY AM IT'S AN I CREDIBLE STUDY AND IT POINTS AGAIN TO THE THE POWER OF OF A THESE QIMO SENSURY SYSTEMS AND PATHWAYS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SO MUCH HERE AM AN I KDOW N OUGH YOU WANT ME TO TO TELL ABOUT THIS RONONAND I GUESS YOU CONNENDED IT OUT O EGAL BUT A ETHIS IS JUST IN ASSURING STORIES ABOUT THE POLITICS OF SCIENCE AND AN SO WHERE IS THE EFFECT ON TISTOSTON WAS WAS A REPLICATED BY BY AN INDEPENDENT GROUP AM IN THE ORIGINAL STUDY AND IN SCIENCE WHERE WE HAD WE IT HAD THREE COMPONENTS ONE WAS THE EFFECT ON TISTOSTRON WHICH WAS ROBAS THE SECTOND WHICH WAS BRAIN ACTIVITY WHICH WAS ROBAST AND THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BUT WEAKER EFFECT ON BEHAVIOR AND I DON'T THINK WE STUDIED THE RIGHT BEHAVIOUR IN RETROSPECT WHAT WE LOOKED AT THEN WAS A READINGS OF AROUSAL ASSOCIATED WITH PICTURES AND THERE THERE WAS AN EFFECT IT WAS SIGNIFICANT BUT IT WAS IT WAS NOT WHAT CARRIED THE STORY AM NOW THERE IS THE LAB IN HOLLAND A OF A GUI BY THE NAME OF VINT AN PROBABLY MISPRONOUNCING THIS BUT I THINK IT VINGER HOATS FOR THE NON DUTCH YE DUTCH NAMES ARE ALWAYS ALILIT OF A CHALLENGE BUT AND I SHOULD SAY THAT AT BEING IN ISRAILWAY I SHOULD GO TOO MUCH ON THAT LINE BUT MADA THAT LAB REALLY DIDN'T LIKE OUR ORIGINAL TEER STORY AND THE REASON THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT IS BECAUSE THEY TE BUILT A CAREER ON THIS NOTION A INCLUDING A BOOK WITH THIS TITLE THAT EMOTIONAL TEARS ARE UNIQUELY HUMAN NOW HERE I SHOULD BE WELL I SHOULD CHAR US ONE OT ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALLY LIKED ABOUT THAT THAT THA A TEER RESULT IS THAT PARTIALLY BEFORE WE DID OUR WORK BUT MORE AFTERWARDS AND AND WE LIKE THAT BECAUSE USUALLY THINGS SO USUALLY IN OUR CEMO SIGNALLING WORK LIKE WHAT I TOLD YOU BEFORE ABOUT THE BRUCE EFFECT WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS OM RUINS AND WE SEE IF THE SAME THINGIS HAPPENING IN HUMANS THIS WAS A RARE CASE WHEREAFTER WE DID THIS WORK A MORALESS IDENTICAL EFFECTS WERE DISCOVERED RUDENTS SO A A PAPER PUBLISHED IN NATURE TWO YEARS LATER FOUND THAT MOUSE TIERS A MOUSE POPTIERS LOWER AGGRESSION AN INA MAL ADULT MICE TOWARDS THEM IN  IN A SMELL DEPENDENT WEYI AM SO  N N THEY ALSO ACTUALLY FOUND THE ACTUAL COMPONENT IN TEARS THAT SO THE TEER FAREMON THAT LOWERS AGGRESSION RIGTS S SO YOUKNOW THIS HAS US THINKING OF AGRET IT AS TEARS AS S AS YOU CAN THINK OF TEARS IS LIKE A CHEMICAL BLANKET IN A WAY TATHAT YOURE COVERING YOURSELF UP AGAIN WITH IN ORD TO PROTECT AGAINST IGGRESSION RIGHT AND AND SO OUR FINDING YOU KNOW WHICH TO ME I MEAN THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW I THINK ABOUT BEHAVIOUR NOW  I  I DON'T THINK IN A BEYOND LANGUAGE THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS DEFFENATLY CENSORY THINGS THAT ARE UNIQUELY HUMAN YOU KNOW I I I AD BE HARD PRESSED BUT SO SO YOU KNOW OUR FINDING WENT AGS  KNOW AGAINST THEIRE THEIR STORY RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW HERE WERE SAYING NOW YOU TEARS ARE THIS CEMEO SINOLIN MECHANISM LIKE ALL ANIMALS AND BY THE WAY I YOU KNO DISAFTER THIS ANTIRE DEBATE ABOUT AM SIX MONTHS AGO THERE WIS A PAPER AND CARN BIOLOGY THE DOGS EMIT EMOTIONAL TEARS AND AND THERE IS TA THE DOGS ADMIT EMOTIONAL TEARS WHEN THEY REUNITE WITH THEIR OWNERS AND YOU WERE TALKING BEFORE ABOUT ABOUT A OXYTOSAN SO I THINK WHAT THEY SHOWED THERE IS THAT NOT ONLY THAT BUT THAT THE THE THE VIEW ASEEM THE TEARS IN THE DOG INFLUENCES OXYTOSEN AND IN THE HUMANS I P I'M GETTING THIS RIG OI ABSOLUTELY LY THE SIMINA FROM FROM THE TIME I BROUGHT COSTELLOHOMA EIGHT WEEKS OLD CASTELLIS YOUR DOG I AS MY DAUGTER FOR YE ASK W HAV' ALON I SHED THE ONLY TIME I CAN RECALL CRYING I LISTEN I I CERTAINLY CRIED BEFORE A MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE AH MANY MANY TIMES A THE ONLY TIME I EVER RECALL CRIMES THE POINT WHERE I WASN'T SURE THAT I COULD KEEP PRODUCING THREE YEARS BUT SOMEHOW IT IS WHEN I HAD TO PUT HIM DOWN I IS THIS THAT YOU KNOWIN IF I TALK ABOUT TOO LONG NOWLS ARE YERE ON TO NOW YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS A I HAD I THING IT'S A HEALTHY YEE O SHURE DAFOR SURE BUT I RECALL WHEN HE WAS A PUPPY THINKING THIS OXY TOSTAND THING MUST BE REAL BECAUSE I CAN RECALL BEING IN FACULTY MEETINGS WHICH YOU DON'T R FAIRLY STATOR NOT ALWAYS THAT INTERESTING BUT THERE THEY CULD BE PRETTY INTERESTING AND SOME ONE PRESENTING DATA AND MY MIND THINKING I HOPE COSTELLOS OKE WHAT'S HE DOING DOWN IN MY OFFICE IS WHEN HE WAS VERY LITTLE AND ALSO NOT NEETING TO EAT NOT BEING ABLE TO FOCUS ON ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT MY ATTACHMENT TO HIM FOR ABOUT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS THAT HADAM THEN IT WAS EASY THEN I COULD FOCUS OFF ON OTHER THINGS AND I THINK IT I THINK THE DOGS PERHAPS THROUGH OXYTOS AND HIGH JACK THE CIRCUITRY THAT'S NOT TENDED FOR CHILD EI REALLY DO OTHERWISE WHY WOULD PEOPLE BE SO RIDICULOUSLY ATTACHED TO THEIR DOGS ME HA NCE ALL THE THE POSTS OF EVEROL THINGS THEIR DOG IS THE KEETEST DOGGERS N EVEROL THINGS THEIR CHILDREN OF THE CUTIS G YOU CI  WELL WELLER  S SSA I SASA SO AGAIN SO THEYSO EVEN YBUT ANOTHER NAIL IN THAT STORY OF AA A TEARS ARE UNIQUELY HUMAN SO THEY'RE NOT DOGS SHED EMOTIONAL TEARS AAND AND AND SU THAT  REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THIS AND THEY WENT AHEAD AND AND TRIED TO REPLICATE AND TO YOUR LISTENERS IAM SHOWING DOUBLE LO QUOTATIONS ON THE REPLICATE ONLY THE BEHAVIOURAL PART THE RAIDINGS OF AROUSAL IM A IN WOMEN OF WOMEN A AND AND FAIL TO REPLICATE THAT I SAY NOW TH THIS WAS IN YOU DISTARING ON HOW SCIENCE WORKS AND DOESN'T WORK IN MY IN MY NOTION IN THIS CASE SO AT THE TIME IM AFTER THEY GOT THIS ACCEPTED IN SOME JOURNAL IM NOT A FIELD JOURNAL IN THE JOURNAL OF MEMORY OF SOMETHING IM THEY CONTACT IN ME FOR A A RESPONSE AND I IA ROD TO THE OFFICN I SAID LOOK YOU KNOW A THIS IS VERY ODT TO ME WHY DON'T YOU COME O WHEN WHY DN'T WE REPLICATE THI AGAIN TOGETHER AND SEE IF IT DOESN'T ORK IF IT DOESN'T WORK I'LL PUBLISH IT WITH YOU THAT IT DOESN'T WORK BUT YOU KNOW IM AND SO I SAID WHY DON'T YOU SEND OVER GRADUSON TOR THE LEAD AUTHOR AND WILL DO IT HERE AND WILL SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE BECAUSE THEY THEY DID IT VERY WRONGLY IN THE PAPER IM AND SO THEY REPLIED THAT ANOTHER ONT OF MONEY TO SEND OVER A GRADUSON TO DO IT SO I REPLIED SAYING OCHAAL FUND THE GRADU SOON COMING OVER AND ALL FUND THE ENTIRE STUDY AND THEYR STAY AND SO AND SO FORTH AND LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER AND THEY REPLIED NO THEY 'RE NOT WILLING TO TO DO THAT WHICH ANOU I DON'T THINK IT'S THE WAY THINGS SHOULD WORK A AND AND THEY PUBLISH THIS SORT OF FAIL A A BEHAVIOURAL EFFECT AND IN THAT PAPER I'M SI'M JUST SHARING THE SENOR THAT IT'S NOT ONLY THERE THERE WAS THAT SUCCESSFUL REPLICATION WITH THE THE EFFECT ON TEST OSTRONE BUT THERE WAS SUPPOSEDLY TISPAILED REPLICATION ON THE EFFECT IN IN BEHAVIOR IM AND IN I PUBLISHED A A REBOTTLE ON ON THAT WHICH I DON'T NOW IF I SHOULD HAVE DONE BUT I DID WELL I THINK IT'S AIT'S INTERESTING I MADE AT THE I THINK IM PROVIDED STUDIES ARE DONE CORRECTLY AMEAN THE THE POSTIVE RESULT UM ALMOST ALWAYS TRUMPS THE THE NEGATIVE RESULT AND YET I THINK REPLICATION IS KEY THE PROMISE YOU POINT OUT IS THAT REPLICATION IS RARELY PURE REPLICATION OF THE YE IV JUST MUDY THIS ONE IS NOT UNRONTLY BUT  IN I PUBLISHD THE DETAIL SO ACTUALLY THEY HID SOMETHING IN THEIR DATA THAT DID PARTALY ROPSIGHT I ASKED FOR THE DAD AND I REANALYZED IT AND THAT'S WHAT I PUBLISHED IN THE REBOTTLE BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST SHARING ON ON HOW SIGNS WOR KS I I TOOK ADVICE TO IM IT'S NOT THAT THID  I'M FRIENDS WITH HIM BUT AT THAT TIME I WAS COMMUNICATING A BIT BECAUSE WE GREOUNDSOME BOARD WITH WITH THA WITH A DANIEL CONMENT WHOS IS NO BALI A ASK INC SLONT RIGHT AND SO SO I ASKED HIM HOW HOW SHOULD I DEAL WITH THIS YOU KNOW GIVE ME SOME ADVICE HERE I WAS REALLY YOU KNOWIT WASN'T EMOTIONALLY NOT FUN TO BE IN THAT POSITION AND HE SAID DON'T I DON'T DON'T NEVER PUBLISH A REBOTTLE DON'T DO ANYTHING IS YOU KNOW HOW CAN I KNOW I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SAID NOT DON'T BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO THAT THEN YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS THEY WON'T READ THE DETAILS OF YOUR ABOTT ALTHOUGH BE LIKE WELL THERE'S A GROUP THAT SAYS THIS AND THERE'S A GROUP THAT AS THAT SO IT'S UNCLEAR WELL AND NO I MAY I I APPRECIATE THE YOUR BRINGING IT UP TO DAY AND I I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU PUBLISHED THE REBOTTLE AND THAT YOU OFFERED IN A VERY MAGNETICEST WAY TO TO DO A CL THAT'S WHAT YOU THEN SAID THAT'S ITS  SA COMMONS ADVICE AFTER THAT WAS THAT WELL IF YOU INSIST THEN JUST PUBLISH  RIGHT A RESPONSE THAT YOU OFFERED THEM TO TO COME DO TOGETHER THEY REFUSED AND THERE'S NOTHING CIN DO ABOUT THAT IT'S A LOT LIKE A FIGHT SPORTS RIGHT PEOPLE TALK A LOT OF TRAP ALTHOUGH IN SCIENCE YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THIS YOUS ALLS WERE ON THE THE ASSOCIOLITY OF SCIENCE THE STAY TURN YOU WORD SIENCE IS VERY DIFFERENT TAN PODCASTING YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA OR A OTHER FIELDS BE IS IN SCIENCE PEOPLES GENERALLY ARE VERY KIND TO YOUR FACE AND THEN THEY YOU GET IT IN I GET IT IN THE NACK ON GRANT REVIEWS OR IONYMOUS REVIEWS AM I WAS ON THE GRANTS FOR YOU PANNEL THIS MORNING I'M A NICE REVIEW OR MEANING I  JUDGE THINGS OBJECTIVELY BUT I I TRY ALWAYS A THINK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE GRADUU STUNER AUTHOR OF THE OF THE PROPOSAL LISTEN I I THINK THAT AM SCIENCE IS IS A GAME OF OF A PEOPLE WHO MOST OF THEM ARE SEEKING FACTS HOWEVER THE THE EGO IS STRONGLY WOVEN INTO IT LIKE ANY LIKE ANYTHING ELSE I THINK IT WAS A VERY MAGNAMINOUS OF YOU TO OFFER THE CLABORATION SO I'M GOING TO TELL THIS LAB WHOSE NAME I CAN'T PRONOUNCE AM PLEASE ACCEPT THE COLLABORATIOND THN WE CAN IVITE EVERYONE ON EROUND TABLE UM APPRECIATE THAT YOU SHARED THAT STORY AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE WILL UM FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I HAVE A COUPLE OF MORE QUESTIONS AM AND I REALIZE AND THANK YOU BY THE WAY FOR YOUR A FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS AND STAMINA BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY ONE I M ISRAEL TIME NOW UM AND YOU JUST ARRIVE O I THINK A BUT YOU'RE DOING A TERRIFICALLY WELL SO I I UM IF YOU'LL INDULGE US JUST A A TOUCH FURTHER THE'RE TWO TOPICS THAT AM I WANT A TOUCH ON IN IF YOU WANT TO COVER THES IN SHORTER THRIFT THAT'S FINE AL THUGH DON'T FEEL ANY OBLIGATION TO AM THE FIRST ONE IS I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE SCENT OF FOOD FOR FOODS AS A SIGNAL OF THE NUTRIENT CONTENTS OF THOSE FRUTS AM YOU KNOW AN ORANGE THAT SMELLS GRAY TOR THE SMELL OF SOMETHING BAKING YOU KNOW IT IN IT IT SUGGEST SOMETHING ABOUT THE THE CONTENTS AND QUALITY THAT FOUIT AFTER ALL YOU AND I BOTH SEPARATELY LIVED IN THE SAME APARTMENT IN BERKLY ABOVE THE CHEESE BOARD WHICH THE SMELL OF  OFITIN OT OU CHEESE  WORD I SONETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET AND THEREDS NEVER FORGET IT I'M AMAZING A GREAT I I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CONVEYED THAT CLEARLY ENOUGH TO LISTENERS OR WATCHERS AND THE PROBABILITY ALY TIST DISCOVERED THAT WE LIVED IN THE SAME WE'VE NEVER MET I MEAN TO FEET LIKE THIS BEFORE AND WE LIVED IN THE EME EXACTLY WHY WE ARE LIE FRIENDS IIN A LINGERING WAY YES I A LOOTHROUG   THROG T WE ATROUG THE HORBOARDS ITD HAD A GREAT FLOOR OF THAT PLACE AND A GREET WON FLORS IN AMAZING PLACE I LIVE THERE WITH MY GIRL FRIEND FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND THEN IT WAS A MAZING ICE A WE WON'T GIVEIT OUT THE ADDR FOR OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE TO LIVE THERE NO A BUT YOU CHECK OUT THE CHEESEBOARD IF YOU EVER IN BRIRKLY THEIR HOURS ARE WEIRD BUT AS YEU HAVE TO LOOK ON LINE BUT THAT THE'RE IT'S UNIQUE PLACE WITH GREAT BREAD AND CHEESE AND UM SOME GOOD PLAVERS OF PIZA A IN ANY CASE UM I'M WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT SMELL CAN SIGNAL THINGS ABOUT THE NUTRIENT CONTENTS OF FOODS IN A WAY THAT'S DIVORCE FROM THE SMELL THAT WE ARE PERCEIVING SO FOR INSTANCE I COULD IMAGINE BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE TOLD US ABOUT SMELL TO DAY THAT IM YOU KNOW I I DON'T KNOW WHY I I SEE I SMELLI A A PIECE OF MEAT COOKING AND IT SMELLS GREAT TO ME AND I THINK OF IT AS AL THAT' SO SAVOURY AND MY MOUTH IS WATERING AND I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS AND I'M THINKING OQUET THIS IS PROTINE AND FAT AND I LOVE THE TASTE OF STAKE AND A LITTLE BIT OF CHAR BUT THAT NATURE HAS COOPTED THAT TO IN SURE OR I SHOULD SAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT I WILL INJEST SOME OTHER THING THAT'S IN STAKE FOR THAT HAS NO ODOR BUT WHOSE NUTRIN CONTENT IS VERY IMPORTANT ME FOR INSTANCE A MENO ASCITS RIT RIGHT I MEAN I MEANOACIDS ARE ESSENTIAL TO LIFE AND YET AM WE DON'T GO ROUND SNIFFING FOR A MINO ASCIDS WE GO ROUND SNIFFING FOR SAVOURINE AS OMAMI TYPE A A TASTAN AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO UM I COULD IMAGINE A MILLION DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF THIS IN THE SAME WAY I COULD IMAGINE THAT THE SCENT OF SOMEBODY THAT WE FALL IN LOVE WITH OR BECOME ROMANTICALLY ATTACHED TO OR YOU SECUALLY ATTRACTED TO IS SIGNALLING ALL SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT SURE THE POOTENTIAL FOR OFFSPRING OF A PARTICULAR MEANS DATIS THAT'S A LONG TERM GAME BUT ALSO AUM SOMETHING ABOUT U A PLEASURE AND SAFETY OF A POTENTIAL INTERACTION SO WHAT I'M ASKING HERE IS ABOUT THAT WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE SUBCONSCIOUS SIGNALS THAT THE AM OLFACTORY SYSTEM HAS A LEARN TO SEE BUT LEARN TO SEEK THROUGH AM MORE OVER SIGNALS OR THAT THE TYPOTHE ICEBERG PHENOMENA SO YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR YOU ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION U OR OR OR GOOD IDEA IN FACT SO SO WHITHER WHETHER THERE'S YOU KNOW ODER CUS O NEUTRANT VALUE IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA MOREOVER IT'S PROBABLY GOOD TO THE EXTENT AT SOMEBODY PROBABLY DID IT AND I SHOULD KNOW AND DON'T UM WE HAVEN'T ONE ANYTHING ON THAT LINE SO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF IF THE NEUTRIANT VALUE OF FOOD IS SYSTEMATICALLY INCLUDED IN ODOR UM IF THAT'S NOT BEEN DONE AND I WILL CHECK AFTER    A MEETING TO DAY THAN IT SHOULD BE UM HIT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA AN WHAT WON THE RESIASIS IS BECAUSE AM YOU KNOW THE OBE CITY CRISIS IN THE USIS A HUGEISSUE AND ELSEWHERE AND HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS UM YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A OFTEN IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCENT THE TASTE AND THE NUTRAND THE NEUTRIANT CONTENT A I DON'T MEAN MACRONEUTRIANT SUGAR FAT I ASCUSE ME A CARBIDERATES FATS IN PROTINES BUT THE THE VITALMENS IN MICRONEUTRIANS THINGS THAT SUPPORT THE MICROBYUM WHEREAS FOODS THAT ARE NOT HIGHLY PROC US FOR INSTANCE MEAT OR A PIECE OF FRUIT A CONTAIN MANY MICHRO NUTRYINS THAT ARE VITAL TO ASPECTS OF OUR VALAGE BE WODON'T GO ROUND SNOTHING FOR PROBIOTICS I'LL TELL YOU ONE SORT OF FACTOYD AT MAY SUPPORT YOUR HYPOTHESIS HERE AND THAT IS THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE POTENTIAL OR FACTORY PERCEPTIBL SIMILARITY IN METABOLIC PRODUCTS SO SOMETHING THAT'S METABOLIZED FROM SOMETHING ELSE AS PERCEPTIBLE SIMILARITY ACROSS THOSE THOSE TWO THINGS SO SO SO METABOLIC CASCADES PLAIN TO THE CODING OF O FACTORY SPACE AND AND THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTION YOUR YOUR OUR IMPLYING BUT AGAIN I DON'T I DON'T KNOW OF A DIRECT TEST OF AVA OF NUTRITIONAL VALUE IN SMELL AND AN AGAIN THE FACT THAT I DON'T KNOW DOESN'T MEAN OF COURSE THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST IN IN THIS CASE I WOULD SUSPECT THAT IT SHOULD EXIST AM IN SCIENTIFIC PRESS AND AND IF NOT THERE THANTHE COMPANIES THAT HAVE VESTED INTEREST IN THIS WHICH ARE MANY O A BRIEFLY SHR DIS DIS LEASE AND ANECED AND AMUSING ANECDOTE TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED TO INDEPENDENT A A PEOP ME NO  COMPANIES WHO HAVE TURNED TO OUR LAB RECENTLY A ASKING FOR HELP A TO TO BRING ODOR TO ENGINEERED MEAT RITE THAT'S A GROWING THING AND ALL THESE INNO MEATS THAT ARN NO THE A TO BRING IT UP THIS THIS AUDIENCE IS GOING TO BE VERY POLERAZI ALONG THE A ONG THE LINES OF ENGINEERED MEAT  A   NO NOT FROM WHAT YOU'RE NOT FROMOTE NO NOI A AM AGNOSTIC BUT BUT A BUT WE'VE HAD GOT TWO COMPANIES TURN TO US AND SAY LOOKING AN WE HAVE THIS GREAT PRODUCT BUT IT JUST DOESN'T S ELL LIKE MEAT SO HELP US MAKE IT SMELL LIKE ME INTERESTING OTHE REASON IS SO POLERIZING IS THAT ANYTHING RELATION UTRITION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS A TOTAL BARBED WIRE TOP WE THAT ATES ON NUTRICIAN COME ON HERE WE'LL HAVE MORE AS I I NO NOTHING ORHERSI OR YOUR SAY NOW O NOIS NOTHING IS NOTA PROMOTING A THAS HE HAS ANYVEN SAID WHETHER NOT HE'S GOING TO HELP THEM OUT NO WE WERE NOT ACTUALLY NO NOT BECAUSE E I JUST N I DIDN'T HAPPEN O THAT THEY THE WEATHER OR NOT THOSE A ENGINEERED MEATS ARE A YOUNG YACKAR TAT IS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE TO PEOPLE IN TERMS OF TASTE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE BETTER FOR NEUTRAL OR WORSE FOR YOU AND THE PLANET THAN GIVEN THE INGREDIENTS THAT ARE REQUIRE THAT'S A A WHOLE WORLD WILL AVOID NOW I WUL BUT TAKU I'LL TAKE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT TA TO HIGH LIGHT SOMETHING RELATED MAY BE BECAUSE IM ON WHAT WERE TO SAY ON THE ON THE SCALE YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS EN I'LL TAKE OPPORTUNITS OF DISSMELL ANOTHER MISCONCEPTION ABOUT ALL FACTION RIGT THERE'S THIS COMMON NOTION THAT OUR SENSE OF SMELL I'M IS INCREDIBLY SUBJECTIVE RIGHT AND THAT WHAT YOU MIGHT LIKE IN THE SMELL I WILL NOT LIKE IN THE SMELL IN THAT WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN YOU KNOW QUOTALLY SUBJECTIVE WORLD OF ALL FACTION I THINK I KNOW THE STUDY YOURE IN I TONE THER'RE MANY THE CROSS CULTURAL SIMILAR AR THER'RE MANY THAT THAT IS UTTERLY UNTRUE MANY NOT ONLY FOR MY LIVE THERE'RE MANY FOR MANY LAPS A POLEACE CLARIFY FOR THOSE THAT  AS A THIS SO SO I'M YE SO SO HUMANS ARE INCREDIBLY SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER AN THEIR ALL FACTORY PERCEPTION AND THIS IS INCONTRASTED WITH TMOST PEOPLE THINK SO WHY WH S THER THISMISCONCEPTION THE MISCONCEPTION IS THERE TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL OR FOR SEVERAL REASONS BUT TO ARE SEND OUT FORSVALL WERE WERE ATTRACTED BY OUTLIERS BECAUSE YOU KNOW HAT YE I'LL TELP SOME MODY LOOK YOU KNOW FOREXSEMPLE FACTORY PLEASANTNESS IS HIGHLY CORRELATED AMONGST HUMANS AND LET'S FIRST PUT THIS I NUMBERS YOU'LL TAKE A A BUNCH OF HUMANS IN A BUNCH OF ODORANCS AND HAVE THEM REAT PLEASANTNESS THE CORRELATION ACROSS A THE HUMANS WILL BE ABOUT POINT EIGHT THAT'S INCREDIBLY HOT INCREDIBLY HIGH WHAT DO YOU THINK IS PLEASANT I THINK IT YOU YE NOW WHY WHY IS THAT GO AGAINST WHAT CULTRALLY PEOPLE THINK FOR TO REASONS FIRST OF ALL WERE WERE ATTRACTED OR OR BYASED BY OUTLIERS BUT THAT'S PARTICULARLY THAT SHOS IN FACT THE RESALPPET I MEANS TO YOU'LL TELL SOME WHAT HOU LOOK PEOPLE ARE VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR PLEASANT NESSESTIMATES AND THE SELL YOU KNOW THAT CAN'T BE I LOVE CYLANTRO AND YOU KNOW MY GIRL FRM HATES THE SMELL OF CYLANTRO RIGHT OR IN THEIRE FEW CLASSIC EXAMPLES THEIRE GUAVA RIGHT YOU KNOW IS ANOTHER AH A PULL ARISING ODORS SO THERE ARE FEW POLE RISING ODORS RIGHT AND AND THAT'S TRUE RIGHT SO THAT'S TRUE THAT YOU KNOW HALF OF THE POPULATION LOVES THE SMELL OF CYLANTRO AND HALF HATES IT HALF LOVE'S GUIAVA HALF HATES IT THAT'S JIGERWAVE PAR PAPGON HOWEVER I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME TO OUR LAB WE HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND ODORANS IN OUR LAB MOQE WE WON'T SMELL THE THOUSAND RIGHT BUT I ASSURE YOU YOU KNOW TAKE A HUNDRED ODORNTS OCAY FROM OUR MIXTURES AND LABS RIGHT AND WA WE'LL SMELL THEM RIGHT AND ARE THE HUNDRED ODORS NINETY WE'LL TOTALLY GREEON RIGHT AND IN CLUDING YOU I MEAN YOU KNOW NOBODY WI'LL SAY THEY LIKE THE SMELL OF FISIS OR FACLE SMELLS AND EVERYBODY ILL SAY THEY LIKE THE SMELL OF ROSE AND FLOWERY SMELLS THERE WILL BE RARE RARE EXCEPTIONS E AND THE CORRLLEYS ABOUT POINT EIGHT ACROSS INDIVIDUALS SO ON NINETY OF A HUNDRED WILL ULY BE IN HIGH AGREEMENTS THEN FIVE ODORANTS WILL BE IN  SORT OF INTERMEDIATE AGREEMENTS AND YES THERE'LL BE THE FIVE ODORANTS THAT WERE IN TOTAL DISAGREEMENT ON BUT I ASK YOU YOU KNOW IF WE AGREE ON NINETY FIVE AND DISAGREE ON FIVE ARE WE THE SAME WORE ARE WE DIFFERENT WE'RE THE SAME THERE'RE JUST OUTLIERS TO THIS TO THIS RULE AND AND AND SO ONE REASON IS THIS ISSUE OF OF OUTLIERS ATTRACT HOW WE THINK ABOUT THINGS BUT KNOW WE'RE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE SIMILAR THAN THAN WHAT WE THINK AND THE SECOND THING THAT THAT DRIVES THIS CULTURAL EFFECT IS THE LUCK IT IS OUR POOR APPLICATION OF LANGUAGE TO A FACTION RIGHT SO SO IN OTHER SENSURY SYSTEMS WE GROW UP WITH WWE WERE WERE WE DEVELOP WITH ANCHORS RIGHT SO SINCE YOU'RE A LITTLE KID YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER SHOWS YOU A COW AND SAYS WHAT DOES THE COW DO MO RID AND WE ALL NO MWU AND WHAT COLOR IS THIS IT'S WELL THIS IS KIND OF AN ODD BLACK BUT IT'S BLACK RIGHT OR R WHAT COLOR IS THAT IT'S RED RIGHT SO YOU HAVE THESE ANCHORS BUT AS YOU ALL KNOW YOU KNOW THE RED THAT I'M SEEING IS NOT INA LY THE RED THAT YOUR SING WE DOEST BOTH KNOW TO CALL THAT RED AND SINCE YOU SAY RED AND I SAY RED I THINK WHY WERE SEEING THE SAME THING BUT NO ONE HOT SEEING THE SAME THING RIGHT AND IN IN ODOR WE DON'T HAVE THOSE ANCHORS RIGHT WE WE KDON'T FROM CHILDHOOD YOU KNOW OUR MOM DOESN'T ALSO WHAT'S THIS SMELL AND WHAT'S THAT'S SMELL RIGHT AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THESE LANGUAGE ANCHORS THAT MAKE US THINK THAT WE'RE PERCEIVING THE SAME THINK NOW HOW CAN YOU PLONTIFY THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT TERM AND IN MEASURING SENSURY SYSTEMS IS SIMILARITY RIGHT THAT'S THE MEASURE RIGHT SO WHAT CAN YOU LET SAY WE TAKE TEN ODRANTS AND I HAVE YOU RATE ALL THE PARAWY SIMILARITIES RIGHT SO YOU END UP WITH FORTY FIVE NUMBERS RIGHT SO KNOW HOW SIMLAR IS ONE TO TWO ONE TO THREE ONE TO FOREIGN THAN TO AN ALL THE POSSIBLE PARWISE SIMILARITIES LET'S A GREAT SIMILARITY FROM ONE WHICH IS TOTALLY DIS SIMILAR A HUNDRED EXACTLY THE SAME RIGHT SO NOW I HAVE A SIMILARITY MATRICKS THAT DESCRIBES ANDREW'S PERCEPTION OF SMELL RIGHT I HAVE YOU KNOW BASED ON THESE TENORANTS THAT I SELECTED NOW I CAN RUN MY SIMILARITY MATRICKS AND THEN I CAN SEE IF THE SIMILARITY MATRICKS ARE CORRELATED RIGHT AND THEN WE'VE GOTE RID OF THE ISSUE OF NAMES AND ORDERS RIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I'LL CALL THIS LEMON AN THIS ORANGE AND YOU CALL THIS SWEET POTATO IN THIS MARSHMELL RGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I THINK THAT THESE TWO ARE HIGHLY SIMILAR AND YOU AGREE AND I THINK THAT THESE TWO ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND YOU AGREE RIHT WE PERCEIVE THE WORLD IN THE SAME WAY IF OUR SIMILARITY MATRESSES ARE LIND RIGHT AND WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THAT IS AT THEN YOU CAN DO THAT FOR VISION ODDITION AND ALL FACTION IN A COMMON GROUP AND YOU CAN SEE WERE WERE MORE ALIKE EACH OTHER OR NOT AND WE'VE DONE THAT FOR COLORVISION ALL FACTION AND TONAL ADDITION OE AND WE'RE MOST DISSIMILAR AND COLORFISION OKE WE'RE IN COLORVISION THE VARIANCE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED PER CENT MAZING IT I DEFEND THERE IS TONS OF LITERATURE ON THIS TONS OF IT TNS OF IT RIGHT AND IND ALL FACTION AND AUDITION THERE ABOUT THE SAME SO WE'RE NOT DIFFERENT WERE VERY SIMILAR WE'RE JUST VERY POOR AT APPRECIATING THIS AND AND MIND YOU NOT THAT THERE IS NOT VERABILITY THERE IS VERY ABILITY AND OF COURSE THE SYSTEM IS MALLABLE AS ALL SENSORY SYSTEMS ARE SO YOU CAN LEARN TO LIKE AN ODOR AND AND THAT WILL CHANGE YOU AND LEARN O THIS LIKE AN ORDER RIGHT BUT JUST YE CAN LEARN TO LIKE A SOUND OR JUSLIKE A SOUND SO YOU KNOW THIS DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE HARD WIRED LINK OF A STRUCTURE TO ITS PERCEPTION THAT YOU CAN TA THERMALABOL AND AND AND WERE WE'RE NOT VERY VARIABLE WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY KIND OF SIMILAR THAT'S A PERFECT ZEGUAY TO THE QUESTION I HAVE NEXT WHICH IS IF IN GENERAL PEOPLE PERCEIVE CERTAIN ODORS SIMILARLY YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT ODORS COULD BE AM MANUFACTURED COOPTED ET CETERA IN ORDER TO ELICIT RICHER SENSORY EXPERIENCES AND DRIVE CHOICE MAKING A THAT'S OBVIOUS AT THE LEVEL OF THE SMELL OF A HOT DOG STAND OR FRESHLY BAKED BREAD ET CETERA BUT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE AND I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT AS DOING THIS SCALE AND A SCIENTISTS GEEKS LIKE TO SAY E IN SILICO IN A THROUGH COMPUTER SO FOR A LONG TIME NOW THERE'S BEEN THIS IDEA THAT AM THERE WILL SOON BE GUGEL SMELL NOT TO CALL OUT GUGL IS THE ONLY SEARCH ENGIONDUCK DUCK GO SMELL FOR THOSE OF YOU THE DIN HEURE SMELL CHEUGITEER YOR IN A CHAT CE BEGIN AND ON AND ON IN OTHER WORDS IU NO VISION VISUAL INFORMATION AS SENT THROUGH A COMPUTER INTERFACES AS IS AUDITORY INFORMATION NOT SO MUCH HAPTIC SOM AT A SENSERY ALTHOUGH IT CAN YOU KNOW WE ARE LAVIUSES OF YOUARE IT'S A IT IT CAN BE DONE RI OM BUT IT HASN'T REALLY TAKEN HOLD AM HOWEVER SMELL BEING SUCH A RICH SOURCE OF BEHAVIORAL AND FORMONAL AND OTHER SORTS OF DEEP DEEP INFORMATION THAT CAN DRIVE PEOPLE INTO YUM YAKOR MET TYPE DECISION MAKING A SEEMS LIKE IN AMAZING CANDIDATE SO WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH AM GENERATING SMELLS IN SILICO IN COMPUTERS AND HERE FOLKS TEFER THOSE OFYOU THAT AREN'T CATCHING ON TO THIS AND AND I DON'T EXPECT THAT EVERYONE WOULD BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY ALLUDING TO HERE AM IS THE IDEA THAT YOU'LL LOOK AT YOU'LL A PUT INTO A SURCHENGIN UM A GLUEBERRY PANCAKES RECIPE AND THAT NOT ONLY WILL YOU GET PHOTOS OF THOSE BLUEBERRY PANCAKES AND A RECIPE BUT YOU WILL GET THE HOPEFULLY VALIDATED ODOR OF THOSE PANCAKES AND THAT RECIPE COMING AT YOU IN REAL TIME THROUGH THE COMPUTER SO I'LL START OFF ANSWERING FROM A FROM THE ATHE NEE YO THROUGHOUT THERE GUGEL SO ABOUT PRALY BOUT FIVE YEARS AGO A GUGEL HAD AN IPOLFOOL SPOOF ALL RIGHT AND THEY PUT OUT THIS VIDIO OF GUGEL SMELL OKAN AND IT HAD ALL THESE LIKE CLASSIC LIKE SAILS IMAGES OF YOU KNOW HOLDING UP YOUR PHONE TO A ROS AND GENERATING ROS AND AN ND ALL THESE THINGS RIGHT SI GUGAL IS NOW TRYING TO DO THAT  AND THEY JUST THEY JUST A A PUBLISHED I MY NIGHT I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IT FOR A WHILE THEYE VISITED OUR LAB A BUT THEY JUST OUGHT OF WHENT PUBLIC WITH THIS THAT REALLY JUST LIKE ABOUT A A MONTH AGO OR SOMETHING THAT THAT AM THEY HAVE THIS OFF SHOOT START UP I THINK IT'S CALLED OZMAO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT STARTED OFF WITH A RIDICULOUS SOME OF MONEY FOR A START UP LIKE I DON'T KNOW TONS OF MONEY LTHERE'S A LOT OF MONEY IN THAT WORM YE AN GUGAYA A TO TA YOU KNOW TODIGITIZE A SMELL AND AND A AND THERE ARE OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THIS AS WELL AM AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING NOW FOR QUITE A WHILE ABOUT OUR OUR LAB'S KEMO SIGNALING WORK BUT ACTUALLY HALF OF OUR LAB IS DEVOTED TO THIS QUESTION OF OF A ULTIMATELY DIGETIZING SMELL AM AND AND  THIS IS A VERY VERY ACTIVE FIELD OF RESEARCH AND AND AND I'LL SAY AM ONE THING THAT THAT DOVE TALES WITH WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE IN MANY WAYS COVID IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPEN TO ALL FACTION RESEARCH BECAUSE SUDDENLY ALL THE WORLD AIS AR ALL THE WORLD LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE ARE A VERY COGNIZANT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SMELL AND SMELLS LIKE WAY UP THERE IN PEOPLE'S WARENESS BECAUSE OF COVIT AND THIS IS DRIVING A RENAISCENCE OF OF ALL FACTION RESEARCH AND AND WARENESS TO ALL FACTION TO SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH PAYING ATTENTION TO A AND AND OUR LAB HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS WAY IN THIS EFFORT FOR A LONG TIME WHEREWERE THE INITIAL PART OF THIS EFFORT IS IN FACT TO DEVELOP A SET OF RULES THAT LINK ODER STRUCTURE TO OD PERCEPTION THAT IS THE GOING SAING UAS THAT UNTIL RECENTLY AT LEAST THERE WAS NO SCIENTIST OR PERFUMER FOR THAT MATTER WHO COULD LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF A NOVEL MOLICULAR MIXTURE AND PREDICT FOR YOU HOW IT WILL SMELL OR A SMELL SOMETHING AND TELLIYOU WHAT IT MOLICULAR STRUCTURE COULD OR SHOULD BE A YOU KNOW SO IN CONTRAST THET SAY O TRIVIALS LIKE COLOR VISION LET'S AY SAY KNOW IF IF IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE WAVELENGTH OF THE LIGHT IS YOU MORALIST KNOW WHAT PERCEIVED COLORS CAN BE OF COURSE THEIR EXCEPTIONS TO THAT AND AND AN ALSTRATS OF VISHES BUT AS A RULE YOU YOU'LD KNOW OR IYU OR THE OTHER WAY ROUND YOU KNOW YOU CAN GENERATE A WAVELENGTH AND YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT CUR LIGHT A IT'S GOING TO BE PERCEIVED AM SO SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE THE RULES LINKING STRUCTURE IN THIS CASE MEASURED BY WAVELENGTH AND PERCEPTION IN THIS CASE EXPERIENCED THIS COLOR THE RULES ARE WELL KNOWN IN ALL FASHION WE'DN'T HALF THAT AM INTIL RECENTLY AM BUT OVER TE PAST TWO YEARS A BUNCH OF LABS HAVE REALLY AM  PUSH THIS FORWARD A THERE'S A BUNCH OF WORK A OUT OF LESLIE VASHHALL'S LAB AT ROCKORFELLER AN UNDRESS KELLOR WORKING WITH LESLEY AM A WHO WO'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS FRONT AM ALSO WORKE FROM JOL MAINLAND'S LAT LAB A AT MONAL AM AND FAIR DISCOVERY JOLL WAS A A GRADUTSION IN OUR LAB M AND AND RECENTLY IN OUR LAB WE'VE HAD AN AND HOPE THIS DOESN'T COME ACROSS IS OVERLY ARROGANT BUT WE WE'VE HAD A SORT OF MANY BREAK THROUGH ON THIS FRONT TO CALL SOMETHING A MANY COULD BREAK THROUGH AS FAR FROM AMERICAN  N AN AND THIS IS A PAPER A LED BY ARMRAVIA A A FROM OUR LAB AND COBE SNITS ALSO A MAJOR CONTRIBUTER THERE A PAPER PUBLISHED IN NATURE A ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO IN THE HEIGHT OF COVE PANDEMIC AN NOBODY REALLY RN I WON'T SEE NOBODY BUT IT WASN'T NOTICED IN THE WAY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN IT WAS IT WAS PUBLISHD IN NATURE REALLY UN LIKE A WEEK WHERE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS LIKE GOING BAZERC OVER COVET M AND IN THIS PAPER WE DEVELOP AN ALGORITHMIC FRAMEWORK A WERE WE CAN PREDICT THE PERCEPTUBLE SIMILARITY OF ANY TWO MOLECULAR MIXTURES WITH VERY VERY HIGH ACCURACY SO IF YOU GIVE ME TO MOLICOR MIXTURES I CAN PREDICT HOW SIMILAR YOU WILL SMELL THEM TO BE YE MOQET NOW NOT ONLY COULD WE PREDICT THAT BUT WE CULD DESIGN IT SO WE CAN GENERATE A A MIXTURES WITH NOINE SIMILARITIES AND THAT THE THE RESULT WAS HIGH LIGHTED AND  YOU'LL APPRECIATE THIS COMING FROM VISION  IS THAT USING OUR ULGARITHMIC SOLUTION WE GENERATED OL FACTORY METIMARS SO WE MEASURED MIXTURES COMPLETELY NON OVERLAPPING IN THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE BUT THO SMELL EXACTLY THE SAME MOQET NOW IF YOU WOULD COME TO A CLASSIC PERFUMER OR MOST CLASSIC PERFUMERS AND TELL THEM THAT YOU CAN GENERATE TWO MIXTURES WITH ZERO MOLECULES IN COMMON BUT SMELL EXACTLY THE SAME THEY WOULD TELL YOU NO AND YET WE DID AND AND ANYBODY CAN RECREATE THEM THIS IS SIMPLE ACTUALLY AM N IN THE PAPER WE DO IF FOU THINGS LIKE WE GENERATE A MEDIMARE FOR A CHANALNUMBER FIVE SO YOU DON'T LIKE PERFUMES OF THIS ONE BUT BUT WE WE WE TAKE SO WE GENERATE A CHENOLUMERFIVE WITH NO COMPONENT FROM CHENALUMBER FIVE IN IT MOQUET A AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PUBLICLY EVELOPLE WEBSIDE I'LL GIVE IT OYOU FOR YOUR LINGTS IF YOU ANT THAT ANYBODY CAN DO THIS WE BUILT I AN ENGINE THAT YOU CAN GENERATE THESE THESE METIMARS NOW ONCE WE DID THAT IN A WAY WE'VE GENERATED THE THE THE IN FOR STRUCTURE FOR DIGITIZING SMELL BECAUSE WHAT AGAIN WHAT WE WHAT ARE WAT AR ALGRATHAN PREDICTS ARE OUR FRAME OF PREDICTS IS SIMILARITY BUT IN AY THAT'S ENOUGH FOR YOU WISE AN ENOUGH WE HAVE A MAP OF A FOUR THOUSAND A MOLECULES A FOR EACH ONE WE KNOW THERE ARE PERCEIVED SMELL NOW YOU CAN MAKE UP ANY MIXTURE YOU WANT FOR ME I CAN PROJECT IT INTO THAT MAP AND MEASURE IT'S PARAWISE DISTANCE FROM ALL THE POINTS IN THE MAP IF IT FALLS ON LEMEN THAN WHAT YOU GENERATED SMELLS LIKE LEMEN AND IF IT FALLS OU KNO ON TOMATO THAN WHAT YOU GENERATED SMELLS LIKE TOMATO SO WE WE NOW SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WE CAN PREDICT THE ODOR OF ANY MALICULAR MIXTURE WE CAN SAY HOW IT'S GOING TO SMELL WHAT WE CAN DO IS THEN FIND A SET OF COMPONENTS WHICH WE CALL ODOR PRIMARIES THAT CAN BE USED TO MIX ANY ODOR THAT YOU CAN PERCEIVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW M AND ABOUTA MONTH AGO SO THIS IS IN COLLABORATION WITH A LAB OF A JONATHAN WILLIAMS AND MAXPLANK AN MEUNUCH A JONATAN WILLIAMS IS AN A ATMOSPHERIC CHEMIST A BUT HE'S REALLY GOOD IT AT USING G C AMES THESE TOOLS THAT MEASURE MOLECULES SO A JONATHAN WILLIAMS MEASURED ODORANCE IN GERMANY  TRANSMITTED THE INFORMATION TO US OVER IPE AWE FED THAT INTO OUR GRHYTHMIC FRAMEWORK AND WE CREATED IT FROM A DEVICE THAT MIXS IS PRIMARIES AAND WE TRIED TO DO FOUR DIFFERENT ODORANCS IN OR OUR PROOF OF CONCEPT TEST A ONE OF THEM A WAS ROSE AND WE FAILED AT RECREATING ROSE WE IN FACT WE CREATED SOMETHING THAT HAD A PROCEPT BUT MOST PEOPLE PERCEIVED IT AS BUBBLEGUM ATHE SECOND ONE WE TRIED TO DO WIS A NICE AND WE FAILED AT RECREATING A NICE AAND MOST PEOPLE SAID IT WAS CHERRY WHICH IS NOT VERY FAR BA IT FAILED ATHE THIRD WAS GASOLINE AAND WE WERE SLIGHTLY BUT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN CHANCE AT RECREATING GASOLIN N A AND THE FOURTH WITH WAS VIOLETS AND FIFTEEN OF SIXTEEN PEOPLE SAID VIOLETS SO THE FIRST ODOR EVER TRANSMITTED OVER I PE IS VIOLETS AND WE DID THAT LAST MONTH A OF COURSE THIS IS NOT ANYTHING NEUERE PRACTICAL SOLUTION A THE DEVICE A AH THE JONATHAN WAS USING TO MEASURE A IS A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DEVICE BIGGER THAN THIS STABLE HIT I REMEMBER WHEN VISY ARS HALF THE AUDIENCE WONLY WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS IS YOURS WERE LIKE THIS BIG OU OR IT WAS ALL GOOD A I'M ALL GOOD WITH THA WITH THE PREDICTION O IS WILL SAY DOWN IN SIZE AND CAUSE I SERE YOU KNOW  DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH UP FOR THIS TO BE UNER TABLE TO MORROW  AND AND YOU KNOW AGAIN EVEN EVEN YOU KNOW ALL WE HAVEN'T HANDES THIS VERY INITIAL PROOF OF CONCEPT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT EVEN YET CLOSE TO BEING A PAPER WE ARE SUBMITTING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOTS OF WORK TO BE DONE AH BUT WE'RE ON ROUND THE PATH AH ROUND THE PATH AND YOU KNOW GUGAL PROBABLY BEAT US TO IT AH THEY GOT A LOT AWE SEEM PRETTY DOGET IN THER Y THEY HAVE SO MUCH MORE RESOURCES THATA THE A AT THIS STAGE DAND THEY'VE THEVE ALREADY PUBLISHED A TO PAPERS FROM THAT EFFORT THAT ARE GOOD AH AH YOU KNOW IF AE DEVIL HAVE A LOT OF DOLLARS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF GOOD A NEROU SCIENCE AND OTHER BIOLOGY ENGINEERING GRAGESONS AN POSTOKS ETER BUT BUT AM THE REAL QUESTION IS ARE THEY GETTING THE BEST PEOPLE BECAUSE AS YOU AND I BOTH KNOW IN SCIENCE THE OFTENTIMES IT'S SMALL GROUPS OF OF THE VERY BEST AND MOST CREATIVE PEOPLE THAT CAN A OUT RUN AN OUT GUN LARGE GROUPS AND AND HERE I DON'T OAAYTHING AGAINST GUGAL YAEAA I I USE IT ALL THE TIME I  IAN OT A BETTING MAN BUT I WOULD PUT MY MY MONEY ON GUGAL ON THIS RACE BUT I'LL GIVE THE I'LL TRY TO GIVE THEM A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY VERY NO THAT WAS WAS  LIKE MOST S WANT TO SEE THE PROBLEM SOLVED REGARDLESS OF WHO I GETS THERE FIRST WHAT I'LL SAYS YOU BETTER GET GOING GUGLE CAUSE NO MUST BEING IS OMERAL AND HE'S DOAM BETTER BETTER GET CRACK AND THERE WE JUST COST THE WEEK ENDS OF ANA I BROKE UP THE RELATIONSHIPS OF I ONC US ON ETON ELSE GAS DO YOU NEVER I REMEMBER HEARING THERE WAS A GUY AND IN OUR COMMON FRIEND A ER A ERINGSOOKERS LAVHED THAT WORKED A HUNDRED HOURS A WEEK SO I WAS LIKE WI'LL WORK ONER IN TWO HOURS A WEEK WHICH WAS NOTGA O ANCASE IVES IT'S A IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS HERE AND ANY OTHER AND I GO TO SOME OF THEIR EARLIER DISCUSSIONS WE HAD AND I THINK WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT TRANSFERRING RECIPES AND SMELLS A OF O FOOD A GASOLINE FROM PEOPLE WATCHING THE THE F ONE RACE OR SOMETHING BUT I'M THINKING DATING APS I'M THINKING IM YOU NOW NOWADAYS EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WHEN YOU TRAVELIN YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR FAMILY YOUR GRAND KIDS AR KIDS YOU BETTER TO GET ON FACE TIME AND SEE THEM RESUME I'M THEN TO JUST HEAR THEIR VOIL WELST I AM NOT BEING ABLE TO SMELL THEM I'LL TELL YOU MORE THAN THAT I'TA MORE THAN THAT I MEAN WE'RE TALKING NOW OF TRYING TO ACHIEVE A THE OLD FACTORY EQUIVALENT OF CIRCON NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BLACK AND WHITE T VIOKE BASICALLY RIGHT I N YOU KNOW IAM NOT DREAMING LETS HE OF BEING ABLE TO TRANSMIT TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CABERNA OR ARMOUR LOW RITE BUT IF I CAN GENERATE SOMETHING THAT'S VAGUELY WINE THAT WILL BE AN AMAZING SUCCESS FROM MY PROSPECTIVE RIGHT BUT JUMP AHEAD IN YOUR IMAGINATION TO TO FOR KA ORDER TRANSMISSION THEN MEDICAL DIGNOSTICS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO BE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IN THIS IS THIS IS A A OVERA EXTENSION BUT YOU CAN ALMOST SAY THAT EVERY DISEASE WILL HAVE AN ORDER I MEAN EVERY DISEASE IS A SPECIFIC METABOLIC PROCESS METABOLIC PROCESS HAVE METABOLITES METABOLITES HAVE A SMELL OL FACTION ONCE IT'S DIGITIZED AND AND HIGH RESOLUTIO WHICH AGAIN IN OUR HANDS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE I MEAN WE'RE TALKING YOU KNOW IN MY RETIREMENT MAYBE I'LL READ ABOUT THIS ONE DAY FALLSTILL HAVE VISION I MEAN THIS IS NOT CLOSES BUT WHEN WHEN ALL FACTION DIGITISATION IS BROUGHT TO THE EQUIVALENT OF FOUR KEY A VISION AND ODITION THAT YOU HAVE NOW THEN IT WILL BE IN MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS YOU'LL HAVE EXCUSE ME FOR THE AR THE IMAGERY BUT YOU WILL HAVE AN ELITRONIC NOS IN YOUR BATHROOM AEACH ONE OF US WILL HAVE IN THE TOILIHT AND IT WILL BE DOING DIAGONOSTICS ALL THE TIME AN AN THAT'S THAT'S WHER ITS CAN GO BUT AGAIN NOT ANYWHERE IN THE VERY CLOSE FUTURE WETL IT'S ITS CERTAINLY AN EXCITING PROPOSITION AND I'M DELIGHTED THAT YOU AND OTHER GROUPS AM WHO ARE SO STRONG OR WORKING ON IT I HAVE REALLY AM NO MY I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO DAY FIRST OF ALL I THIS WAS IT TREMENDOUSLY INTERESTING CONVERSATION AND WE TOUCHED ON SO MANY THINGS HORMON SMELLS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE OLD FACTORY SYSTEM I KNOW THAT PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS A REALIZING WHAT I'MN TO SAY AT ANYWAY WHAT AN INCREDIBLE GIFT YOU'VE GIVEN US IN IM AS E AS A EXPERT IN THIS FIELD GIVING US THIS TOUR OF OF THE WORK THAT YOU AND OTHERS IWHO YOU CREDIT SO GENEROUSLY IM HAVE DONE TO ELUCIDATE THIS INCREDIBLE SYSTEM THAT WE CALL FACTION CUMEO SENSATION ALSO JUST FOR THE INCREDIBLY PIONEERING WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE YOU KNOW I I DON'T HAVE MANY HEROES IN SCIENCE I HAVE HEROS OUTSIDE ASINCE IN A FEW IN SCIENCE BUT I'M AN AT IM OF AN INA PURPOSELY EMBARRASS MYSELF A LITTLE BIT BY SAYING THAT FROM THE TIME I WAS AT BERKLY AND I THEN AND SAW THAT EXPERIMENT BEING DONE AT PEOPLE FORGING A FALLING SENT TRAILS AND THEN WHEN I WAS AT U UNTIL I WAS A JUNIOR PROFESSOR I USED THAT IN MY TEACHING SLIDES IM IN A CLASS THAT I TAUGHT THETE WAS SORT OF THE EARLY ORGINS OF THIS PODCAST IN ANY WAY AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN YOUR LABORATORY PUBLISH HIS PAPERS I FIN LIKE THIS IS SUPERINTERESTING SUPERCOOL AND I FIND MYSELF TELLING EVERYBODY ABOUT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I DO FOR A FOR A LIVING AS I I LEARN AND THEN I BLAB ABOUT IT TO TO THE WORLD SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DONE IN THE SPIRIT THAT YOU BRING TO IT WHATEVER DRIVES THAT SPIRIT AS THE GREAT LATE BENBARRASS USE TO SAY KEEP GOING BECAUSE WE ARE ALL BENEFITING TREMENDOUSLY AND IM AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS THE THE SPIRIT OF SCIENCE IS ONE OF AS YOU MENTION THEIRE'S COMPLEX POLITICS AND ALL THESE THINGS BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT YOU DELIGHT IN THE WORK YOU DO AND I'M SO I DELIGHT IN IN IT I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME TO DAY AND SO I'M BEHALF OF ME AND AND THE MANY MANY PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS I JUST ONE EXTEND IT A HUGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE THANK YOU SO MU UT ESO IM M THI'M BLUSHING I DON'T KNOW IF THIS DOESN'T COME ACROSS ON H ON THE RADIO PODCASTBAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR VERY WARM WORDS YOU KNOW WIT E AS YOU KNOW IT YOU WHEN YOU WORK IN YOUR LAB YOU DON'T THERE'S THESE MOMENTS WHERE YOU SOMELINY DISCOVER THAT SOMEBODY IS LIKE CAREIS A BIT ABOUT IT AND THOSE ALWAYS VERY REWARDING MOMENTS BECAUSE USUALLY YOU YOU FUNCTION WITHOUT THAT I MAN I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF THINGS YOU NEED TO BE A SCIENTIST IS TO HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE DRIVE TO WORK WITHOUT THAT IS IT COMES ONLY RARILY THERE'S IMMENSE GRATITUDE IND APPRECIATION FOR YOU AND WHAT YOU DO FROM ME AND NOW I KNOW FROM A A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE WORLD AS WELL SO A MY ONLY REQUEST IS THAT YOU COME BACK AND TELL US ABOUT ATHE NEXT RESULTS SOMETIME NOT TO L NOW WELL WELL I I WON TO CATCH YOU LIVE NOW ATHOUGH YOU HAVE THE POWER TO EDIT THIS I GUESS THAT'S NOT FAIR BUT FIRST YOU COME VISIT US IN ISRAEL AND AND TELL US BOTH ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND THE PUBLIC SCIENCE WORK HERE DOING AND THEN I'LL COME AGAIN AT A GOOD BARGAIN RGAN I I THAN YOU SO MUCH PLEASURE THANK YOU FOR JOIN ME FOR TO DAY'S DISCUSSION ABOUT OLD

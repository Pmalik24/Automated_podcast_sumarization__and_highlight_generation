THE MENSHVIR SHOW SPONSIRBY EXPRESSIV HEPIAN PRIVACIES A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE DEFEND YOUR RIGHT THAT EXPRESSIVVEPIANTA COMS FLASHMAN THE MASSSHOOTER IN LOUISTIAN MANE IS STILL AT LARGE HE HIS DONE EXTRAORDINARY DAMAGE EIGHTEEN DEAD THIRTEEN INJURED LIVES ENDED LIVES DESTROYED FAMILY'S RECT IN AMERICA SUCH EVENTS QUICKLY DEVOLVE INTO THE USUAL ARGMENTS THOSE WHO ARGUE FOR GUN CONTROL BLIME THE WEAPON CARRIED BY THE SHOOTER THEY POINT OUT THAT HE WAS CARRYING IN A RE FIFTEEN AND THAT HE HAD A HIGH CAPASINY MAGAZINE THEY SAY THAT MEANS GUNLAWS ARE TOO LOOSIN THAT IF THEY HAD BEEN TIGHTER THE SHOOTER NEVER WOULD AVE BEE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE WEAPON GUNRIGHT'S ADVOCATES ARGUE BY CONTRAST THAT THE SHOOTER WAS MENTALLY ILL THAT ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST HE HAD QUOTE SO ALARM PEOPLE AROUND HIM THAT HE WAS HOSPITALIZED AND RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THIS SUMMER PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE SHOTER TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT QUOTE IN RECENT MONTS HE DESCRIBES HEARING DISTURBED VOICES AND INCREASINGLY BECOME FICATED ON THE BOWLING ALLEY AND THE RESTAURANT OR HE ALLEGEDLY OPEN FIRE IT'S UNCLEATER WHERE THE SHOTER GOT HIS WEAPON IF HE DID NOT HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD A FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECK WOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED HIM FROM GETTING A WEAPON ANYWAY BUT MAN ALSO HAS A SO CALLED YELLOW FLAG LAW THAT REQUIRES POLICE TO GET A MEDICAL PRACTITIONER TO EVALUATE SOME ONE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND IDENTIFY THEM IS A THREAD TBEFORE THE POLICE CAN PETITIONAR JUDGE TO ORDER A PERSONS FIREARMS SEIZED IF EVER SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR USE OF SUCH A LAW THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED IN THE END THE ARGUMENT'S FORT AN AGAINST GUN CONTROL AREN'T GENERALLY ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF ANY PARTICULAR POLICY LEAST NOT ONE T COMES TO MASS SHOOTINGS  MASSHOTINGS ARE STATISTICAL OUTLIERS THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOMICIDES INVOLVING FIRE ARMS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE COMMITTED WITH HAND GUNS NOT LONG GUNS ACT IVE SHOTER OVENTS CONSTITUTE A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL HOMICIDES WELL HE MEDIATE TEND TO COVER LARGE SCALE MAS SHOOTNGS LIKE THE LOUISTON SHOOTING THEY TEND TOIG NOR MASHOOTING CEN CITIES LIKE CHICAGO DESPITE THE FACT THAT FIREARM TOMICIDERTE FOR BLACK AMERICANS IS SOME FOURTEEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT FOR WHITE AMERICANS NOW THE ARGUMENTS FOR GUN CONTROL TEN TO CENTRAL LIES AROUND ONE PARTICULAR ARGUMENT THE ARGUMENT THAT NO ONE COULD  QUAT NEEDS IN A R FIFTEEN OR ANY GUN FOR THAT MATTER THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THE PRESENT AN BIDEN ROUTINELY MAKES TO THOSE GRAV RIGHT LING AMERICAN SAY IT'S ALL ABOUT SHAPIN AMERICA CAPIAN AMERICAS INDEPRENDEN SAY IF YOU WANT A FIGHT AGAINST TA CONTRINITO F FIFTEEN YOU NEED A SOME LITTLE MORE THAN A GUN THE IY D THE IDEA WE STILL ALOW SIMIO AMOUT  WRIS SICK TIS SICK HIT HAS NO NO SOCO THE VAL STER NUN NOT A SINGLE SOL TO RATIONAL FOR SO PROE UN IF YOU WANT A PROTECT YOURSELF GET A DOUBLE BY AL SHOCK GON HAVE THE SHELLS O TWELVE GAG SHACK A PROMISE HO IS EVER COMING IN HIS LOCKER HOU DON'T NEED A OR FIFTEEN IT'S HARDER AT AM IT'S HARDER O USE AND IN FACT HOU DON'T NEED THIRTY ROUNDS TO PROTECTSO BY SHO KON IN NONE OF THAT IS TRUE NONE OF THAT IS TRUE ALSO NOTICE HIS LANGUAGE THERE WHEN HE SAYS NO ONE EED TO SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPON THAT'S LIKE ENORMAL AN GUN THT IS A NORMAL RIFLE A SEMIAUTOGMATIC WEAPON JUST MEENS THAT EVERY TIME YOU PULL THE TRIGGER THE GUN SHOOTS THAT'S ALL AND THEN IT RELOADS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT TO SEM MY AUTO IS BUT IS BIDON RIGHT ON PRINCIPLE I SPEEND PART OF MY DAY YESTERDAY WITH MY WIFE AND SOME FRIENDS AT GUNRANGE WHILE WE ARE THERE WE WORKED IT MY SMITH AND WESSON AMEN PE SHIELD MY MILLIMATE OR MY MOSBERG FIVE HUNDRED CHOCKON AND YES MY A R FIFTEEN WHY PRECISELY WERE WE AT THE GUNRANGE MESIM BEAUSE I LOVE THE GUNRANGE IT'S BECAUSE SINCE THE OCTOBER SEVENTH TERROR ASSAULT ON THE GAZA ENVELOPE ANTI SEMANTISM ACROSS THE WEST HAS SKY ROCKETED I CURRNTLY HAVE FULL TIMES SECURITY ON MYSELF ON MY FAMILY PROBLY GREN TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT LEVEL OF SECURITY THE REST OF OUR LIVES BUT IT' NOT JUST MEE PETTY MUCH EVERY JEW I KNOW WHO CAN OBTAIN A WEAPON IS NOW TTEMPTING TO DO SO AND THEY SHOULD AS ALL LAW ABIDING AND RESPONSIBLE ADULTS SHOULD OWNING A WEAPON IS IN THE END THE ONLY PROTECTION AGAINST THE DARKNESS THE JEWS WERE MURDERED RAPED AND KIDNAPPED IN THE GOSA ONVELOPEERE LARGELY ONARM IS RAEL HAS EXTREMELY STRICTE GUN CONTROLAWS IN THE WAKE OF THE MASSACRE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS RAILIES ARE NOW SEEKING TO ARM THEMSELVES AS THEY SHOULD OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND IS RAILIES HAVE REPORTEDLY SUBMITTED GUN LICE ENCES APPLICATIONS CLOSER TO HOME THE STORY IS THE SAME THERE ARE EVIL PEOPLE WHO SEEK TO DO HARM TO INNOCENT PEOPLE ON WEDNESDAY MORNING FOR EXAMPLE A MAN WAS ARRESTED IN STUDIO CITY CALIFORNIA AFTER BREAKING INTO A HOME WITH THE MAZIZA THAT IS A A SCROLL ON THE DOOR POST OF JEWISH HOMES MARKING IT IS A JEWISH HOME THE MAN WAS SCREAMING FREE PALISTIN AND KILLD JEWS IN TRYING TO KICK IN A DOOR  NOW NEW YORK JEWS ARE BEING TOLD TO STAY INDOORS BY SECURITY SOURCES OVER CHABAT HECAUSE PROL COMMASS PROTESTERS ECIDED TO DESCEND ON BROOKLIN ONCHAVAT AFTERNOON ACCORDING TO SEOWHILE LIVE DAT COM JEW SHOULD AVOID WALKING AROUND CROWNHEIGHTS A HEAVILY ORTHODOX NEIGHBORHOOD ACCORDING T THE ANTI DEFIMATION LEGUE ANTHE SMENT AC INCIDENTS OFE INCREASED BY THREE HNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT PER CENT THIS MONTH YEAR OVER YEAR WHY WOULDN'T EVERY JEW WANT TO CARRY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES PEOPLE OF DECENCY ON ALL SIDES DO WANT THE SAME THING HERE INNOCENCE PROTECTED AND THE DANGEROUS DISARM THE QUESTION IS HOW BEST TO ACHIEVE THAT GOL SIMPLE MINDED STATEMENTS ABOUT BLANKET WEAPONS BANDS ARE NOT THE ANSWER AND THOSE ANSWERS MAKE EVEN LESS SENSE COMING FROM MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO SEE THE POLICE AS THE PROBLEM SO NO I'M NOT GOING TOBE GIVING UP MY AR FIFTEEN BECAUSE A MENTALLY ILL PERSON WHO NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAD WEAPONS COMMITTED AHANE IS HACET OF EVIL IN FACT THAT IS PRECISELY WHY I KEEP BY WEAPONS TBECAUSE EVIL PEOPLE DOING EVIL THINGS ARE NOT STOPPED BY PARCHMENT BARRIERS IN JUST A SECOND WE'LL GET TO THE POLITICAL RESPONSE TO THE MASS SHOOTING AND MAN WICH OF COURSE HAS FOLLOWED ALL THE TRADITIONAL HALL MARKS OF THE DEBATE FIRST PURE TAK RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THEY WULD ALLEVIATE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN VETERANS AT BY VETERAN'S DAY THANKS TO YOUR SUPPORT THEY'RE FIFTY THREE PER CENTS THAT GOLL WITH TWO WEES TO GO THING ABOUT THIS THEUST MILITARIES MADE UP OF ONE HUNDRED PER CSENT VOLUNTEERS THESE ARE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILLINGLY SACRIFICE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE FOR THIS COUNTRY WHEN THEYRE DONE SERVING THEY RETURN HOME TO A TIGHT CHOB MARKET AND OUTRAGEOUS LIVING EXPENSES THAT IS WHY I'M SO HAPPY A PRIVATE COMPANY LIKE PURE TALK HAS JUMPED INTO HELP WHEN YOU SWITCH TWO PURE TOCKS LIGHTNING FASTFIVE TO NETWORK THEY WILL DONATE A PORTION OF EVERY NEW ORDER TO THIS EXCELLENT CAUSE YOU CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE JUST BY CHOOSING SUPERIOR SELF ON SERVICE PURETALKS PLANS STARTED JUST TWENTBUX MONTH OFFERING ON LIMITED TALK TACED MORE DATA AND MOBILE HOSPOT JUST GO TO PURETAK DOT COM SLASH CHIPIRO AND MAKE THAT SWITCH BUT'S RALLY TOGETHER SHOWIN WAVERING SUPPORT FOR OUR VETERANS IS IT PURE TALK DOK COM SLASH CHIPURO SWITCH TO PURE TALK TO DAY ITS THE RIGHT MOVE IT'S THE AMERICAN WAY VISIT PURETALK DOT COM SLASH CHIPRO AGAIN THITS PURE TOKTOK COM SLASH PURO I USE PURTOK FOR ALL OF MY CALLS GREAT TOWER NOTWORK WHICH WEANS THE RECEPTION IS REALLY GOOD PLUS I'MS HAVING MONEY PLUS I'M HELPING OUT COZA LIKE PURE TALK DOT COM SLASH PURIGAL CHECK MAURING OUT PURE TOKTO COM SLASH CHIPIRO TOD A BEGA SO AS FOR OUR USUAL ARRANGEMEN THESE SHOOTINGS ALMOST INVARIABLY INVOLVE SOMEBODY WITH OBVIOUS RED FLAGS LIKE OBVIOUS OBVIOUS RED FLAGS AND THEN THE MEDIA DECIDE TO IGNORAL THE RED FLAGS IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA THAT A HUNDRED MILLION GUNNERS OUGHT TO GIVE UP THEIR GUNS BECAUSE IN THE END THE IDEAS THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECTIN NOW I DON'T TRUST THE GOVERNMENT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE I DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN PROTECT ME IN THE FIRST INSTANCE SOERE I LIVE GREAT SHERIFF'SDEPARTMENT EXCELLENT POLICE DEPARTMENT EVERYBODY  ONE FORSEMEN IS EXCELLENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S CAN TAKE HEM A LITTLE WHILE TO RESPOND TO AN ACTUAL BAD THING HAPPENING D IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD THEY ARE IT WILL TAKE THEN AT THE VERY LEAST A FEW MINUTES TO GET TO A PLACE AND THAT IS TOO LATE FOR THE PEOPLE WHARE IN THAT PLACE HER'S ALL VERY SPECULATIVE UNTIL IT HAPPENS IN A PLACE WHERE YOU ARE WHICH IS WHY AT MI SENGOG HAVE TO GAZ O CARRYING WE HAVE SECURITY AND WE HAVE HAF THE GI'S CARRYING THAT IS A GOOD THING THAT IS A WORTH WHILE THING WHENEVER SOMEBODICES AS WELL GOOD GUIS WITH GUNS DONE STOP BAD GOS HE GUNS KTNOW THE ANSWERS THEY DO THEY IT'S OT IT' ALWAYS SUCH A WEIRED ARGUMENT THEY'L SAY THINGS LIKE WUP YOU NOUG'T REALLY STOPS THE BAD GAV A GUN IS EITHER HE COMMIT SUICIDE OR THE COP STOPON YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE ON TEENE WHO A HAD A GUN STHEY TO WAIT UNTIL GUI WAS DON SHOOTING A BUNCH PEOPLE FOR THE COPS TO GET THERE IN SHOOTOGUY OR WHAT Y CAN AWAIT THEIR FURTLEGATICOMENT SUICIDE I GOUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART YOU THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT'SGOING TO STOP THIS THING AN THE REALITY IS ONCE AGAIN THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS IN INVOLVING A MASSHOOTER IS A SITUATION IN WHICH THE PERSON HAS ALL SORTS OF INDICATORS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT OF HAD A GUN IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SOMEBODY DROP THE BALL SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WHICH REALLY SPEAKS TOO A A LACK OF BELIEF IN THE ACTUAL SOCIAL FABRIC BECAUE IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY AROUND YOU WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE A GUN SOMEBODY AROUND YOU WHO HAS SEVERE MENTAL ILNESS YOU AVE AN OBLIGATION A MORAL OBLIGATION TO REPORT THAT TO THE AUTHORITIES IN THE MORAL AND AND THE AUTHORITIES OVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO TRY TO GET THAT PERSON THA CARE THEY NEED AND REMOVE FROM THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVE ACSESS TOAL WEAPON THAT IS YOUR MORAL OBLIGATION IT IS A THING T YOU SHOULD DO BY THE SAME TOKAN IT IS IMMORAL TO REMOVE FROM A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN WHO KNOWS HOW TO USE A GUN HIS MEANS OF SELF DEFENSE THAT IS IMMORAL THE FIRST WRIGTE ANY OF US HAVE IS THE RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE AND DOFENSE OF OTHERS OBVIOUSLY WE WHENEVER ONEOF THESE SHOOTINGS HAPPENS OBVIOUSLY MOTIONS RUNRALLY HIGH AND YOU SEE SOME POLITICIONS WHO DECIDED THEI'R GOING TO SHIFT THEIR OPINIONS ON POLITICALISS OU NOT BECAUSE NEW EVIDENCE IS EMMERGE BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW EMOTIONALLY STRUCK BY THE ISSUE I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THIS TYPE OF POLITICS IF YOUR POSITIONS CHANGED RADICALLY NOT BECAUSE NEW EVIDENCE DEMERGE THAT THE DEBONT YOUR PRIOR POSITION BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE JUST RESPONDING MORE EMOTIONALLY TO THE ISSUE THAT'S NOT A GOOD REASON  TO SHIFT YOUR OPINION ON AN ISSUE IT ISN'T EVIDENCE IS SUPPOSED TO DECIDE YOUR POSITIONS ON THE ISSUES WELL THERE WAS A CONGRESS PERSON YESTERDAY AND JER GOLDEN DEMOCRAT FROM MAN WHO REVERSED COURSE ON GUN CONTROL NOW MAIN IS A DEMOCRAT DOMINATED STATE T HAS DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR IT HAS TWO DEMOCRATIC IT HAS ONE DEMOCRATIC ENTER ONE REPUBLICAN SENTER AND IT HAS A DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE SO HERE IS IS JER GOLDEN WHO IS A MAIN CONGRESS PERSON WHO REPRESENS LOUIST AND NOW COMING OUT IN FAVOR OF GUN CONTROL WHICH IS THE POLITICALLY SAFE THING TO DO AFTER A MASS SHOOTING OBVIOUSLY BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO NEW EVIDENCE THAT'S BEN PROVIDED THAT THIS WOULD THAT WHAT FORM OF GUN CONTROL WOULDHAV STOPE THIS FROM HAPPENIN SEREIS WHAT FORM AF GUN CONTROL THE APPARENTLY ALREADY HAD GUNS KNOWN NOW HIW OBTAINE THE GUNS AND WE DO KNOW THAT HE WAS LITERALLY INSTITUTIONALISE JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND SOMEHOWS TO WIT ACCESS TO THE WEAPONS WHAT LAWS ON THE BOOKS WOULD HAV CHANGED THIS HERE IS JOUR GOLDEN ADVOCATING FROM ORE LAWS ANYWAY  NONME ON IS WY  O ON A NESA AN THE ONE IS BY THIS SAT ER IS MAS CIM MOM DOWNAS MAN TO TE GIEN MONE ME AR WERI A O TO GETI ON N O I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY HE SAYING IT'S HIS RESPONSIBLE WHAT IS THE LAW THAT HE FAILED TO PASS TAT WOULD PREVENT TO THIS CHRISTMURPHY OF CONNECTICUT SENATOR LONG TIME ADVOCATE FOR GUN CONTROL HE THEN ACTUALLY STOMPED ON THIS GUY THAT'S THE ALSO TH WAY POLITICS WORSO EVEN IF YOUR VIRST POSITION TH THEN THE PEOPLE WHO REFLECT YOUR NEW POSITION WAL STOMPON HERE'S CHRISTMURPHY GOING AFTER YESTERDAY I DON'T KNOW REPRESENTATIVE GOLDEN PERSONALLY I KNOW THAT HE'S A PRETTHE CONSERVATIVE A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AH AND HE'S COMING TO THE SAME REALITY THAT MANY OTHERS HAVE WHICHIS DEMOCRADS WEAPONS DON'T DESERVE TO BE ON THE STREETS OF AMERICA THEU CAN PROTECT PEOPLE SECOND A MEMTH RIGHTS BUT JUST MAKE SURE THAT FOKS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE WEAPONS OF WAR BUT I WISH IT DIDN'T TAKE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO HAVE TO EXPERIENCE AMASS SHOOTING IN THEIR OWN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT TO COME TO THES REALITY I'M GLAD THAT REPRESENTATIVE GOLDENS MADE THIS DECISION UM BUT WHY DOES IT TO HAVE TO HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN MEAN DO DOES HE HAVE A SOLUTION THAT W STOP THUS FROM HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THERE SOME FIFTY PEOPLE WHO ARE SHOT IN CHICAGO OVER THE WE GET NOBODY NEW STORY ABOUT IT BECAUSE NOT AS SPECTACULAR DOESN'T GRAB THE HEADLINES IN THE SAME WAY THOSE WERE ALMOST INVARIABLY WITH HAND GUNS TYOU DON'T SEE CHRISTMURPHY TALKING ABOUT ANY OF THAT AND AGAIN THIS IS THE EASY LIER'S WAY OUT OF THE DILEMMA THE REAL ARGUMENT THA THAT PEOPLE ONLEFT THAT THEY ARE HONEST ONE AHAVES THAN KNOWINCH VE GUN THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THEY REALLY WANE A HAVE THEY DO'T ON MAKE THAT ARGUMENT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT TO LOSING ARGUMENT BUT THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT THEY ACTUALLY YOU WANT TO MAY

BIGGEST PROBLEM SO THE BINDADMINISTRATION NETS TIT CONTINUED TO DEMONSTRATE A STIFF UPPER LIP AND A STIFF SPINE IF THEY DO THIS THING WILL REMAIN CONTAINED WHICH IS THE BEST INTERESTS CERTAINLY OF THE UNITED STATES AND MEANWHILE MIKE JOHNSON IS THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE MOVING TO TRY TO UNDER CAUGHT HIM AS SPEAKER SUGGESTING THAT HE IS AN EXTREMEST OF COURSE THIS IS THEIR NEXT MOVE AD THING TE CAN HAVE TOUGH TIME WIT THIS BECAUSE MIKE JOHNSON IS VERY PERSONABLE FELLOW JIMMY RASKIN DEMOCRAT FROM MARYLAND  HE ISN'T NOW ACCUSING JOHNSON OF OPPOSING DEMOCRACY AND SUGGESTING AT THE SAME TIME HE WANTS TO DAN THE REGULATORY STATE BY THE WAY THESE TWO THINGS ARE IN CONFLICT BANDING THE REGULATORY STATE MEANS IN A REPUBLIC IT MEANS UP HOLDING DEMOCRACY THE REGULATORY STATE IS NOT

EIGHTEEN DANIEL HAD AN ENTIRELY NEW PERSONNER HE WAS JUST DIFFERENT HE HAD A DIFFERENT M WAY IF CARRYING HIMSELF HE SEEMED YOU KNOW MORE MILITARY LIFE STYLE THEN HE WAS LIKE YOU KNOW OH YM IM EXECUTIVE PROTECTION SECURITY YOU KNOW AND I ASKED HIM TO EXPLAIN IT AND AS IKE SO LIKE YOUR SCURITY GARDER LIKE IT LIKE A CONTRACTOR HE WAS LIK TIT THIT THE EXACT WORDS THIS  CAS IS SUCH A STUPID STATEMENT I I REMEMBER IT HE SAYS A I ESCORTED ESSENTIAL AND NON ESSENTIAL PERSONEL THROUGH THE THEATER OF BATTLE AM AND I WAS LIKE A OKE COOL AND THEN LIKE I REMEMBE HIM SAYING IT I REMEMBER HIM SAYING IT TO OTHER PEOPLE AS FOR DANIEL'S CLAIMD THAT HE'S A PRIVATE MILITARY CONTRACTOR HE DID STARSECURITY COMPANY CALLED GARMDYNAMICS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH A GI NAME EAENSPURGEON A FORMER OFFICER IN THE SWEEDISH MILITARY THE TWO OF THEM MET AND AN EXECUTIVE PROTECTION TRAINING COURSE DENMARK HEINSAID AT THE TRAINING DANIEL RALLY IMPRESSED HIM HE SAID LOOKED LIKE HE HAD REAL EXPERIENCE DID HE SAY HED TT WHAT AIN'T HE TELLS THE WORKLIC HAD IT BEEN OVER SEES HAD AT BEEN IN HIGH STRESS IN VIRONMENTS IKE ANYTHING LIKE THET Y I SAID HE HAD A OVERSEES CONTRACTS AND A A  WITH HE WAS GOVERNMENT AND ALSO BIT THE PROVESECTOR A AND AGAIN IT FRFROM MY BACKGROUND  IM I'M PROE NOT TO AND ASK QUESTIONS AS REALLY ITS IF IF IT'S NOT MY NEED TO KNOW THAT I'M REALLYED ON AN ASK ANY QUESTIONS THE IDEA WAS THAT GARM DYNAMICS WOULD DO SECURITY CONTRACTING AND TRAIN PEOPLE IN MILITARY TACTICS THE GARNWEBSIDE HAD SEALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY IN OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ON IT BUT HEN TOLD ME THAT THE NEVER ACTUALY WORK FOR ANY OF THEM HE SAID DANIEL HAD ASSURED HIM IT WAS O KATY USED TO LOGOS THE WETSIDE ALSO SAID THE COMPANY WAS QUOTE ESTABLISHED IN FACILITY BY LEA MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT PERSONNOW WAS THERE ANING  ALSE THAT WAS LIKE A LHE MILITERY OVERNEN PERSON ON HIS IZ YOU O WA WA THERE WAS ONLY THE TOO IUT I DON'T KNOW HOW HE LIKE IT HOW HE HAD BUT BUT AGANIEL O ENHANCSING THE MARKET ABILLY OF TETHE COMPANY YEWEASE A YOU MOT YOU MOLY FASTEN TUES OF INSTRY EXPIRTS FRENDS IC ANALISTS A TEL IS EXFERTS ON THE GROUND SOURCES PROVIDED TOWGENS TO MISICESSN IS THAT ELSE JUST TAT MARKERIN EHYEH AND ITHERE'S A A PICTURE O LIK E THIS WONT IS N'T A PICTURE OF HIS DUES IN THE ALLCOCTER AND THEIR FACES ORE WORRD OW YE I THATS LIKE A STOCK FOLDOW I THINK IT IS HE INSAID GUARD NEVER GOT ANY CONTRACTS NEVER DID ANY TRAININGS AT LEAST WHEN HE WAS THERE THENTUALLY DANIEL SEEME BE GETTING SUCKED MORE AND MORE INTO HIS PROBLEMS UP IN VERMONT AND THE COMPANY DIED DANIEL ALSO REGISTER A SECOND COMPANY THAT IS STILL ACTIVE BUT I COULD FIND ONLY ONE PERSON ON LINKTON WHO SED HE'D WORK THERE AND WHEN I MESSAGED HIM ABOUT THIS HE TOLEAVE IT FROM IS PROFILE IT'S HARD TO SAY FOR SURE OF DANIEL EVER DID WORK ITS PRIVATE MILITARY CONTRACTOR OR IF HE DID WHETHER REALLY INTAIL DODGING BULLETS IN A ROCK AS HE ONCE CLAIM TO ME YOU CAN'T CHECK THAT KIND OF THING THROUGH PUBLIC RECKOR'S REQUESTS AND PEOPLE WHO DO PRIVATE CONTRACTOR WORK ALSO USUALLY HAVE TO SIGND ON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS THE OTHER WORK DANIEL SAYS HE'S DONE HIS SUECUTIVE PROTECTION WHICH IS THE BUSINESS OF GUARDING THE RIGCH AND FAYMENTS WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM ONE ASPECT OF THIS DANIEL WORK FOR A TIME ON A DETAIL PROTECTING BENCH A PERO TCON SERVATIVE COMMENTATOR THOUGH HE WAS ULTIMATELY FIRED FROM THAT JOP OI SPOKE WITH A FEW PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES PART OF THE SLATE RIGE FAMILY THEY SEE A THOTALLY DIFFERENT VERSION OF DANIEL IN THE NEIGHBORS TO SA MANT THE SHUM WAY IS ONE OF THE COFOUNDERS OF THE VRERMONT STATE MILITIA SHE SAYS THEIR SURVIVALIST THEY 'RE PRETY SMALL GROUP ABOUT TEN MEMBERS THEY TRAIN ONCE A MONTH SHE THIRTY TWO HAS FOUR KIDS WHO CALLED DANIEL UNCLE DANIEL SHE TOLD ME HE'S NOT DANGEROUS AT ALL HE JUST SOME ONE WHO WANTS THA SHARE IS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GUNS HE TAUGHT THEM ALL FIRE ARM SAFETY SHE AND THE OTHER MILISH REMEMBERS DRIVE ABOUT TWO HOURS TO GET TO SLATE RIDGE YOU'VE KNOW THEY ARE MUCH CLOSER RANGES BECAUSE THE FASILITY IS SO NICE AND BECAUSE DANIEL IS SO WARM AND WELCOMING SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THE EIGHBORS ARE REALLY A SCARED AS THEY SAY SHE THINKS THE'RE EXAGGERATING THEIR FEARS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT A NOISY SHOOTING RANGE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY'RE AFRAID OF CHANGE THEY HAVEN' EVEN MET US SHE TOLD ME SHE DID THINK THE FACE BOOK THREATS WERE OVER THE LINE AFTER THE HE LOT TRUCKING VIDIEL SHE IN SOME OTHERS IN THE SLATE RIGE FRAMILY TOLD DANIEL HE NEED O STOP IT WAS ALL PART OF WHA SHE CALLED A BATTLE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WHICH SHE DIDN'T SEE HOW COADAND AT THIS POINT BUT THE THINK SHE WAS MORE WORRIED ABOUT WAS THE GOVERNMENT TAKING DANIEL'S LANT IT'S A PIECE OF HIM SHE TOLD ME IN ANY COMMUNITY THEY ARE BASIC RULES AND LAWS WE AGREE TO LIVE BY IT'S HOW WE'RE ABLE TO COSE THIS BUTIN PALLIT DANIEL WAS CLEARLY NOT PARTICIPATING ALL THAT AND THE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE MEANT TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT'S LIKE HE'S MANAGE OUT MANEUVER THEM SIMPLY BY CREATING CHAOS FOR INSTANCE WITH THE STATES NATURAL RESOURCE SPORT DANIEL MIGHT BE INVIOLATION OF THE VERMONT LAND UE SLAW BUT THEY NEED TO PROVE THAT HE'S RUNNING OF BUSINESS HE SAYS HE'S NOT THAT EVERYTHING AT SLATE RIDGEIS FREE AND SO FAR THE NATURAL RESOURCES BOARD HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVE OTHERWISE AND TAKE THOSE CASES IN NEW YORK ONE OF THEM IS A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM WHICH REQUIRED HIM TO SURRENDER HIS FIREARMS I ASKED LONG FORCEMEN AUTHORITIES AN VERMON ABOUT THIS COULD THEY INFORCED NEW YORKS ORDER GO AND SEES HIS GUNS IT SAID YES THEY COULD BUT HERE'S THE IRONING YEUVEN KNOW THE EIGHBORS HAVE BEEN HEARING ALL THA SHOOTING FOR SO LONG EVEN THOUGH DANIEL TALKS ABOUT ALL THE WEAPONS HE HAS THERE'S NO HARD PROOF THAT HE CURRENTLY HAS ANY IN HIS POSSESSION IF YOU LOOK AT HIS FACE BOK POSTS BODOS MIVIOS HE NEVER APPEARS WITH GON FOR A WHILE NOW SOME THE EIGHBORS HAVE HAD THIS FEELING THAT'S NEW TO THEM THAT THE SYSTEM 'S FAMILING THEM THAT THE PROTECTION THAT THEY TOUGHT IT PROVIDED ISN'T ACTUALLY THERE I THINK THIS CAN CREATE THE SPECIAL KIND OF ANXIETY ANT LED THEM TO TAKE THINGS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS THIS IS MY CAVELLER TAST TO THIS IS THIS UNDERNEATH YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW  TE BATH SHOW ME RATHER HOUSE WITH NO MACHINERAY HAVE WEAPONS HIDDEN EVERYWHERE JUST IN CASE THIS IS

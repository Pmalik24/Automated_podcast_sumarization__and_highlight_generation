WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANNC SCIENCE SCIENCE PACETONCE EI MANDRHUBERMAN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEROBOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TODAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR DAVID BERSON PROFESSOR OF MEDICAL SCIENCE NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT BROWN UNIVERSITY DOCTOR BERSON'S LABORATORY IS CREDITED WITH DISCOVERING THE CELLS IN THE EYE THAT SET YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHMS THESE ARE F THE SO CALLED INTRINSICALLY PHOTO SENSITIVE MELONOPSAN CELLS AND WHLE THAT'S A MOUTHFUL ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR A SAKE OF THIS INTRODUCTION IS THAT THOSE OF THE CELLS THAT IN FORM YOUR BRAIN INBODY ABOUT THE TIME OF DAY DOCTOR BERSON'S LABORATORY HAS ALSO MADE A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES ABOUT HOW WE CONVERT OUR PERCEPTIONS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD INTO MOTOR ACTION MORE PERSONALLY DOCTOR BERSON HAS BEEN MY GO TO RESOURCE FOR ALL THINGS NERO SCIENCE FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES I KNEW OF HIS REPUTATION AS A SPECTACULAR RECEARTUR FOR A LONG PERID OF TIME AND THEN MANY YEARS AGO I COLD CALLED HIM OUT OF THE BLUE I A BASICALLY CORRALLED HIM INTO A LONG CONVERSATION OVER THE PHONE AFTER WHICH HE INVITED ME OUT TO BROWN AND WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING NEROW SCIENCE AND HOW THE BRAIN WORKS AND THE EMERGIN KNEW TECHNOLOGIES AN THE EMERGING NEW CONCEPTS IN NERO SCIENCE FOR A VERY LONG TIME NOW YOU'RE GOING TO REALIZE TODAY WHY DOCTOR BERSON IS MIGHT GO TO SORCE HE HAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR AND ORGANIZED VIEW OF HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS NOW THERE ARE MANY MANY PARTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM DIFFERENT NEUCLIEE AND CONNECTIONS AND CIRCUITS AND CHEMICALS AND SO FORTH BUT IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON TO BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE THAT INFORMATION INTO A STRUCTURED AND LOGICAL FRAME WORK THAT CAN ALLOW US TO MAKE SENSE OF HOW WE FUNCTION IN TERMS OF WHAT WE FEEL WHAT WE EXPERIENCE HOW WE MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD DOCTOR BERSON IS TRULY ONE OF A KIND IN HIS ABILITY TO SYNTHESIZE AND ORGANIZE AND COMMUNICATE THAT INFORMATION AND I GIVE HIM CREDIT AS ONE OF MY MENTORS AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT I RESPECT MOST IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE AND MEDICAL SCIENCE GENERALLY TO DAY DOCTOR BERSON TAKES US ON A JOURNEY FROM THE PERIFERY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MEANING FROM THE OUTSIDE DEEP INTO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM LAYER BY LAYER STRUCTURE BY STRUCTURE CIRCUIT BY CRCUIT MAKING CLEAR TO US HOW EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUITS WORK AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER AS A WHOLD IT'S A REALLY MAGNIFICENT DISCRIPTION THAT YOU SIMPLY CANNOT GET FROM ANY TEXT BOOK FROM ANY POPULAR BOOK AND FRANKLY AS FAR AS I KNOW FROM ANY PODCAST THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS OUT THERE SO IT'S A REAL GIFT TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM DOCTOR BERSN AGAIN I CONSIDER HIM MY MENTOR IN THE FIELD OF LEARNING AND TEACHING NERO SCIENCE AND I'M EXCITED FOR YOU TO LEARN FROM HIM ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN BY THE END OF THIS PODCAST YOU WILL KNOW FAR MORE ABOUT HOW YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS THAN THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE INCLUDING MANY EXPERT BIOLOGISTS AND NERO SCIENTISTS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGRENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR I'VE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES IND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THE'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOT COM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR DAVID BURSEN WELCOME THANK YOU NWSO NICE TO BE HERE GREAT TO HAVE YOU FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS YOU'VE BEEN MY GO TO SOURS FOR ALL THINGS NERVOUS SYSTEM HOW IT WORKS HOW ITS STRUCTURED SO TO DAY I WON'T ASK YOU SOME QUESTIO NS ABOUT THAT I THINK PEOPLE WOULD GAIN A LOT OF INSIGHT INTO THIS MACHINE THAT MAKES THEM THING CAN FEEL AND SEE IT ECETERA IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU TELL US HOW WE SEE YOU KNOW A PHATON OF LIGHT ENTERS THE EYE WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT HOW IS IT THAT I LOOK OUTSIDE I SEE A TRUCK DRIVE BY OR LOOK ON THE WALL I SEE OF PHOTO OF MY DOG HOW DOES THAT WORK RIGHT SO THIS IS AN OLD QUESTION OBVIOUSLY AND CLEARLY IN THE END THE REASON YOU HAVE AF VISUAL EXPERIENCE IS THET YOUR BRAIN IT'S NOT SOME PATTERN OF ACTIVITY THAT ASSOCIATES WITH THE INPUT FROM THE PERFERY BUT YOU CAN HAVE OF VISUAL EXPERIENCE WITH NO INPLET FROM THE PERFERY AS WELL WHEN YOUR DREAMING YOURE SEEING THINGS THATE AREN'T COMING TO YOUR EYES ARE THOSE MEMORIES AHI WOULD SAY IN A SENSE THEY MAY REFLECT YOUR VISUAL EXPERIENCE THARE NOT NECESSARILY SPECIFIC VISUAL MEMORIES BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN BE BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF SEEING IS ACTUALLY A BRAIN PHENOMENON BUT OF COURSE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WE SEE THE WORLD BECAUSE IT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AND ENRERUSING OUR EYES TO LOOK AT IT AND FUNDAMENTALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EXPERIOR WORLD IT'S WHAT THE RETINES TELLING THE BRAIN THAT MATTERS SO THERE ARE SELLS CALLED GANGLIN ELLES ES ARE NURONS THERE ARE THE KEYSELLS FOR COMMUNICATING BETWEEN EYE AND BRAIN THE EYE IS LIKE THE CAMERA IT'S DETECTING THE INITIAL IMAGE DOING SOME INITIAL PROCESSING AND THIN THAT SIGNAL GETS SENT BACK TO THE BRAIN PROPER AND OF COURSE IT'S THERE AT THE LEVEL OF THE QUARTEX THAT WE HAVE THIS CONSCIOUS VICUAL EXPERIENCE THERE MANY OTHER PLACES IN THE BRAIN THAT YET VISUAL INPUT AS WELL DOING OTHER THINGS WITH THAT KIND OF INFORMATION SO IGHT I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT COLOR VISION IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN PERCEIVE REDS AND GREENS AND BLUES THINGS OF THAT SORT RIGHT SO THE FIRST THINK TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT LIGHT IS THAT IT'S JUST A FORM OF ELECTRO MAGNETIC RADIATION AH ITS VIBRATING IT'S OSCILLATING BUT ITTO SAY IT'S VIBRATINS OCILLING YOU MEAN THAT PHATONS ARE ACTUALLY MOVING WELL IN A SENSE FOTONS ARE THERE CERTAINLY MOVING THROUGH SPACE WE THINK ABOUT PHOTONS AS PARTICLES AND THAT'S ONE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT LIGHT BUT WE CAN ALSO THINK OF IT AS A WAVE LIKE A RADIO WAY EITHER WAY IS ACCEPTABLE AND TE RADIO WAVES HAVE FREQUENCIES LIKE THE FREQUENCIES ON YOUR RADIO DIAL AND CERTAIN FREQUENCIES IN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM CAN BE DETECTED BY NURONS IN THE RATINA THOSE OF THE THINGS WE SEE BUT THEREE STILL DIFFERENT WAVELINGS WITHIN THE LIGHT THAT CAN BE SEEN BY THE EYE AND THOSE DIFFERENT WAVELNGS ARE UNPACKED IN A SENSE ARE DECOTED BY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO LEAD TO OUR EXPERIENCE OF COLOR OM ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT WAVELANGS GIVE US THE SENSATION OF DIFFERENT COLORS THROUGH THE AUSPICES OF DIFFERENT NURONS THAT ARE TUNE TO DIFFERENT WAVELINGS OF LIGHT SO WHEN A A PHOTON SO WHEN A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT HITS MY EYE RIDOS IN THE PHOTO RECEPTORS CONVERT THAT INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNAL RIGHT HOW IS IT THAT A GIVEN PHOTON OF LIGHT GIVES ME THE PERCEPTION EVENTUALLY LEAVES THE PERCEPTION OF RED VERSES GREEN VERSES BLUE RIGHT SO AH IF YOU IMAGINE THAT IN THE FIRST LAYER OF THE RETINA WHERE THIS TRANSFORMATION OCCURS FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION INTO NURL SIN S THAT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SENSITIVE CELLS THEY ARE EXPRESSING THEIR MAKING DIFFERENT MOLECULES WITHIN THEMSELVES FOR THIS EXPRESS PURPOSE ABSORBING PHOTONS WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS OF SEEING NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT ALTOGETHER THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE PROTINGS LIKE THIS THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IN THE TYPICAL RETNA BUT FOR SEEING COLOR REALLY ITS THREE OF THEM SO THAT THREE DIFFERENT PROTINGS EACH ABSORBS LIGHT WITH THA DIFFERENT HAE PREFERRED FREQUENCY AND THEN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HEEPS TRACT OF THOSE SIGNALS A A COMPARISON CONTRASTS THEM TO EXTRACT SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAVELIKE COMPOSITION OF LIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE JUST BY LOOKING AT A LANDSCAPE OH IT MUST BE LATE IN THE DAY BECAUSE THINGS ARE LOOKING GOLDEN THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW FUNCTION OF OUR ABSORBING THE LIGHT THAT'S COMING FROM THE THE WORLD AND INTERPRETING THAT WITH OUR BRAIN BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT COMPOSITION OF THE THE THE LIGHT THAT'S REACHING OUR EYES IS IT FAIR TO ASSUME THAT MY PERCEPTION OF RED IS THE SAME AS YOUR PERCEPTION OF RED WELL THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THAT MINE IS BETTER  IT'S THE GREAT QUESTIONIS A DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION IS A QUESTION THAT REALLY PROBABLY CAN'T EVEN ULTIMATELY BE ANSWERED AH BY THE USUAL EMPIRICAL SCIENTIFIC PROCESSESS CUSS IS REALLY ABOUT YOU NOW AN INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE A WHAT WE CAN SAY IS THAT THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR SEEING COLOR FOR EXAMPLE SEEM TO BE VERY HIGHLY SIMILAR FROM ONE INDIVIDUALS THE NEXT WHETHER IT BE HUMAN BEINGS OR OTHER ANIMALS AH AND SO WE THINK THAT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS LOOKS VERY SIMILAR ON THE FRONT AND BUT YOU KNOW WHATCS YOUR AT THE LEVEL OF PERCEPTION OR UNDERSTANDING OR EXPERIENCE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TOFFERED AN NAIL DOWN WITH THE THE SORTS OF YOU KNOW A SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES THAT WE A APPROACH BIOLOGICAL VISION WITH THIS I YOU MENTION THAT THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT CONE TYPES ESSENTIALLY THE CONES BEING THE CELLES THAT ABSORB LIGHT OF DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS A IOFTEN WONDERED WHEN I HAD MY DOG A WHAT HE SAW AND HOW HIS VISION DIFFERS FROM OUR VISION AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE ANIMALS THAT CAN SEE THINGS THAT WE CAN'T SEE RIGHT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MORE OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLES OF THAT OF SEEING ANSIMPTING  IN THE EXTREME A YOU KNOW A DOGS I IGUESSING SEE REDS MORE AS ORANGES IS THAT RIGHT CAUSE THEY THEY DON'T HAVE T IES THE SAME ARRAY OF OF NURANS THAT WE HAVE FOR FIRST SEEN COLOR RIGHT SO THE FIRST THING IS IS NOT REALLY FIVE TYPES OF COMS THERE REALLY THREE TYPES OF CONS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THAT COLOR ISH S THOUGHT TO WORK YOU CAN SORT OF SEE THAT IT HAS TO BE THREE DIFFERENT SIGNALS THERE ARE COUPLE OF OTHER TYPES OF PIGMENTS ONE IS REALLY MOSTLY FOR DIM LIKT VISION WHEN YOU'RE WALKING AROUND AND A MOONLESS NIGHT IN YOUR SEEING THINGS A WI VERY LOW LIKE THAT'S THE RD SELL NAT USES IS OWN PIGMENT A AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER CLASS OF PIGMENTS WILL PROPEYOU TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER THE SMELL AND OPSAN PIGMEN I THOUHT YOU REFERRING TO LIKE ULTURE VIOLET AND INFORRED AND AND WHIOS OR RIOT SO IN THE CASE OF A TYPICAL A WELL AS PUT IT THIS WAY IN IN HUMAN BEINGS MOST OF US HAVE THREE CONTYPES AND WE CAN SEE COLORS THAT REBIT THAT STEM FROM THAT IN MOST MANNELS INCLUDING YOUR DOG A OR YOUR CAT THERE REALLY ARE OLLY TWO CON TYPES AND THAT LIMITS THE KIND OF VISION THAT THEY CAN HAVE IN THE DOMAIN OF WAVELENGTH OR COLOR AS YOU'D SAY SO REALLY A DOG SEES THE WORLD KIND OF LIKE A PARTICULAR KIND OF COLOR BORNT BLIND HUMAN MIGHT SEE THE WORLD BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING THREE CHANNELS TO COMPARE IN CONTRAST THEY ONLY HAVE TWO CHANNELS AND THAT MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHICH WAVELENG YERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT TO A COLOR BLIND PEOPLE SUFFER MUCH AS THE CONSESEQUENCE OF BEING COLOR BLANT WELL WEU KNOW WERE IT ITS LIKE SO MANY OTHER DISABILITIES WE ARE A I THAT THE THE WORLD IS BUILT FOR PEOPLE OF THE MOST COMMON TYPE SO IN SOME CASES THE EXPECTATION CAN BE THERE THAT SOMEBODY CAN SEE SOMETHING THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO IF THEY'RE MISSING ONE OF THEIR CON TYPES LET SAY SO IN THOSE MOMENTS THAT CAN BE A REAL PROBLEM A YE KNOW IF THERE'S A LACK OF CONTRAST TO THERY VISUAL SYSTEM BA WILL BE BLIND TO THAT IN GENERAL IS A FAIRLY MODEST A VISUAL A A LIMITATION AS THINGS GO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IF NOT BE ABLE TO SEE ACUTELY CAN BE MUCH MORE DAMAGE AND NOT BEING ABLE TO READ IN A FIND PRINT FOR EXAMPLE THA'S WAS FID TO GIVE UP AM A THE ABILITY TO SEE CERTAIN COLORS OR GIVE UP THE ABILITIES SEE CLEARLY I CERTAINLY TRADE OUT COLOR FOR COLARITY RIGHT OF COURSE COLORS VERY MEANFUL TO US AS HUMAN BEING YOU KNOW A SO WE WOULD HATE TO GIVE IT UP BUT OBVIOUSLY DOGS AND CATS AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER MAMMELS DO PERFECTLY WELL IN THE WORLD TAN BECAUSE WE TIKE CARE OF THEM ISPEND N HERE THAT ON A IF YOU CARE ME TO A LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THAT ODD PHOTOPIGMANT AM FHOT O PIG MEN OF COURSE BEING THING THAT ABSORBS LIGHT OF A PARICULAR WAVE LENGTH AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE SPECIALIZED GANGLING SELLS THAT COMMUNICATE CERTAIN TYPES OF INFORMATION FROM EYE TO THE BRAIN THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR SO MANY THINGS WHAT I'M REFERRING TO HEAR OF COURSE IS YOUR R CO DISCOVERY OF THE SO CALLED INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE SELLS THE NURONS IN THE EYE THAT DO SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT DON'T ACT SHOEU HAVE TO DO WITH PERCEPTION BUT HAVE TO DO WITH IMPORTANTMIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS WHAT I WOULD LOVE FR YOU TO DO AS A EXPLAIN TO ME WHY ONCE I HEARD YOU SAY WE HAVE A BIT OF FLY I  IY AND YOU SHOWED THIS SLY OF A A GIANT FLY FROM A HORROR MOVI TRYING TO ATTACK THIS WOMAN AND MAYBE WAS AN IY ALSO SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT WE HAVE A BIT OF A FLY IY IN OUR EYE YEW SO THIS IS THIS LAST PIGMENT IS A REALLY PECULIAR ONE AM IT ONE CAN THINK ABOUT IT AS REALLY THE INITIAL SENSITIVE ELEMENT IN I SYSTEM THIS DESIGNED TO TELL YOUR BRAIN ABOUT HOW BRIGHT THINGS ARE IN YOUR WORLD AH AND THE THING THAT'S REALLY PECULIAR ABOUT THIS PIGMENT IS THAT IT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE IN ESSENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE RATINA YOU THINK ABOUT A LAYER CASE ESSENTIALLY YOU'VE GOT US THIS THIN MEMBRANE AT THE BACK OF YOUR EYE BUT IS ACTUALLY A STACK OF THIN LAYERS AND THE OUTERMOST OF THOSE LAYERS IS WHERE THESE PHOTOROSCEPTORS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ARE SITTING THAT'S WHERE THE FILM OF YOUR CAMERA IS ESSENTIALLY THAT'S WHERE THE PHOTONS DO THEIR MAGIC WITH THE PHOTOPIGMENTS IN TURN IT INTO A NURRL SIGNAL I LIKE THAT NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF THE PHOTORCEPTERS AS THE FILM OF THE CAMERA WITH THE MIC SENSE OR LIKE THE SENSITIVE CHIP ON UNO SESEDY CHIPPIN YOUR IN YOUR SELPHON IT'S THE SURFACE ON WHICH THE LIGHT PATTERN IS IMAGED BY THE OBTECTS OF THE EYE AND NOW YOU'VE GOT IN A RAY OF CENSORIS TIT'S CAPTURING THAT INFORMATION IN CREATING A BIT MAP ESSENTIALLY AH BUT NOUITS IN NERL SIGNALS DISTRIBUTE ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE THE RETINA SO ALL OF THAT WAS KNOWN TO BE GOING ON A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO A COUPLE OF TYPES OF PHOTOCEPTERS CHONES AND RODS IF YOU LOOK A LITIT MORE CLOSELY THREE TYPES OF CONS THAT'S WHERE THE TRANSFORMATION FROM ELECTROMATING AT NET GRADIATION TO A TO NURAL SIGNALS WAS THOUGHT TO TAKE PLACE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS LAST PHOTOPIGMENT IS IN THE OTHER END OF THE RETINA THE INNERMOST PART OF THE REDNAND THAT'S WHERE THE SO CALLED GANGLIN SELLS ARE THOSE OF THE SULLS THAT TALK TO THE BRAIN THE ONCE THAT ACTUALLY CON COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WHAT INFORMATION COMES TO THEM FROM THE PHOTORI CEPTORS AND HERE YOU'VE GOT A CASE WHERE ACTUALLY SOME OF THE OUTWUT NURONS THAT WE DIDN'T THINK HAVE ANY BUSINESS BEING DIRECTLY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT WERE ACTUALLY MAKING THIS PHOTOPIGMENT ABSORBING LIGHT AN CONVERTING THAT TO NERAL SIGNALS IN SENDING TO THE BRAIN SO THAT MADE IT PRETTY SUCH SURPRISING AND UNEXPECTED BUT THE'RE MANY SURPRISING THINGS ABOUT THESE CELLS SO WAN WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE FL IY THE RIGHT SO T THE LENGTH THER IS THAT IF YOU ASK HOW THE PHOTOPIGMENT NOW COMMUNICATES DOWNSTREAM FROM THE INITIAL ABSORPTION EVENT TO GET TO THE ELECTRICAL SIGNAL THAT'S A COMPLEX SOL TOR PROCESS ARBOVES MANY CHEMICAL STEPS AND IF YOU LOOK AT HOW POTORECEPTORS IN OUR EYES WORK YOU CAN SEE WHAT THAT CASCADE IS HOW THAT CHAIN WORKS IF YOU LOOK IN THE EYES OF FLIES OR OTHER INSECTS OR OTHER INVERTIBRATES HI'S A VERY SIMILAR KIND OF CHAIN BUT THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE SIGNAL AS YET FROM THE ABSORPTION EVENT BY THE PIGMEN TO THE ELECTRICAL RESPONSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN UNDERSTAND OR CHARACTERISTICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN FUZZY FURRY CREATURES LIKE US AND INSECTS FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE FLY I SAY SO THESE FUNNYEXTRA VOTORECEPTORS THIT ARING THE WRONG LAY OR DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OR ACTUALLY USING A CHEMICAL CASCADE THAT LOOKS MUCH MORE LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A FLY PHOTORIS CEPTOR THAN WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A HUMAN FOTOR RECEPT OR ROD OR CONE FOR EXAMPLE SO IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS A VERY PRIMITIVE PART OF A PRIMITIVE ASPECTS OF BIOLOGY THAT WE MAINTAIN EXACTLY RIGHT THE AAND DESPITE THE FACT THAT DOGS CAN SEE AS MANY COLORS AS WE CAN AND CAS CAN SEE AS MANY COLORS AS WE CAN WE HAVE ALL THIS EXTRAVAGANT STUFF FOR SEEN COLORAND THEN YOU GET THIS OTHER PIGMEN SITTING IN THE WRONG NOT WRONG BUT IN A DIFFERENCE A PART OF THE EYE SENDING PROCESSING LIKE VERY DIFFERENTLY RIGHT AND SENDING THAT INFORMATION INTO THE BRAIN SO WHAT DO THESE CELLS DO I MEAN PRESUMELY THERE THERE FOR A REASON THERE ARE AND THE THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT ONE SELL TIME LIKE THIS CARRING ONE KIND OF SIGNAL WHICH I WOULD CALL A BRIGHTNESS SIGNAL ESSENTIALLY CAN DO MANY THINGS IN THE BRAIN WHEN YOU SAY BRIGHTNESS SIGNAL YOU MEAN THAT IT LIKE RIGHT NOW I HAVE THESE SELL AVE THESE E I DEAS NIN IM ATOKING I HOPE I HAVE THESE ELLS OM I OM AND THEIR PAYING ATTENTION TO OWBRIGHT IT IS OVER ALL BUT THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION FOR INCSTANCE TO THE EDGE OF YOUR EAR OR WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN THE ROOM RIGHT SO SO IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING WHAT THE OBJECTS ORE ON THE TABLE AND KNOWING WHETHER IT'S BRIGHT ENOUGH TO BE DAYLIGHT RIGHT NOW SO WHAT WHITE IS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN NEEN NEED TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S DAYLIGHT RIGHT NOW WHILE ONE THING THAT NEEDS KNOW THAT IS YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCK YOU IF YOU TRAVEL ACROSS TIMEZONS TO EUROPE NOW YOUR INTERNAL CLOCK THINKS IT'S CALIFORNIA TIME BUT THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH IS YOU KNOW FOR YOU KNOW A DIFFERENT PART OF THE PLANET YOURE THE RISING IN SETTING OF THE SUN IS NOT AT ALL WHAT YOUR BODY IS ANTICIPATING SO YOUVE GOT AN INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH IN YOUR OWN BRAIN THAT'S YOUR CIRCADIAN SYSTEM IS KEEPING TIME BUT NOW YOUV PLAYED A TRICK ON YOUR NERVOUS IS TOM YOU PUT YOURSELF INTO DIFFERENT PLACE WHERE THE SUN IS RISING IT THE COT WRONG TIME LET'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU RIGHT SE YOU GOT TO GET BACK ON TRACK ONE OF THE THINGS THIS SYSTEM DOES IT SENDS A OH IT'S DAYLIGHT NOW SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN WHICH COMPARES WITH ITS INTERNAL CLOCK AND IF THAT'S NOT RIGHT IT WEEKS THE CLOCK GRADUALLY UNTIL YOU GET OVER YOUR JETLAC AN YOU FEEL BACK ON TRACK AGAIN SO THE JET LAG CASE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME BUT PRESUMELY THESE A ELEMENTS DIDNT OF OLVE FOR JETLAG RIGHT SO WHAT WAT WHAT ARE THEY DOING ON HA DAY TO DAY BASIS RIGHT WELL ONE ME TO THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE CLOCK THAT YOU HAVES IN NOT JUST YOUR BRAIN IN ALL THE SALLS  ALMOST ALL F THE SELLS OF YOUR BODY THEY'RE ALL OSCILLATING OU'RE ALL WE KNOW TEGOT LOT CLOCK IS  LITTLE CLOCKS AN THEMSELVES THERE ALL THEY'RE ALL CLOCKS AM YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO BE SYNCRANIZED APPROPRIATELY AH AND THE WHOLE THING HAS TO BE BUILT IN BIOLOGICAL MACHINERY THIS IS ACTUALLY F BEAUTIFUL STORY ABOUT HOW GENE EXPRESSION CAN CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION AND IF YOU SET IT UPRIGHT YOU CAN SET UP A LITTLE THING THAT JIS SORT OF HUMS ALONG AT A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY IN OUR CASE IT'S HUMMING ALONG AT TWENTY FOUR HOURS CAUS USS HOW OUR EARTHROTTASE IT IS ALL BUILT INTO OUR BIOLOGY SO THIS IS GREAT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE CLOCK CAN ONLY BE SO GOOD WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BIOLOGY ERE IT'S NOT PRECISION ENGINEERING AND SO IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OFF W ALSO IT DOESN'T IT'S IN OUR BRAIN SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY REGULAR UNERRING SIGNAL WELL IF IN THE ABSENCE OF THE RISING AND SETTING OF THE SONNET DOES IT IF YOU PUTS SOMEING IN A CAVE THEYRE BIOLOGICAL CLOCK WILL KEEP TIME TO WITHIN A HANDFUL OF MINUTES OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT'S NO PROBLEM FOR ONE DAY BUT IF THIS WENT ON WITHOUT ANY CORRECTION EVENTUALLY YOU BE OUT OF PHASE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BLIND PATIENCE OFF AND COMPLAIN ABOUT I THEY'VE GOT RETNALL BLINDNESS IS IN SOMNIA AND AHLORE'S ANN'S AYATING THAT RING AN A EXACTLY THE'RE NOT SYNCRINIZE OUR CLOCK IS THERE BUT THEY'RE DRIFTING OUT OF PHASE BECAUSE OUR CLOCKS ONLY GOOD TO YOU HAVE TWENTY FOUR POINT TO HOURS OR TWENTY THREE POINT EIGHT HOURS THIUL BY LITTLE YHOURE DRIFTING SO YOU NEED A SYNCRANIZATION SIGNAL SO EVEN IF YOU NEVER ACROSS TIME S HOSON OF COURSE WE DIDN'T BACK ON THE SANANA WE STAYED WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF WHERE WE WERE AH YOU STILL NEED A SYNRANIZER AS OTHERWISE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO ACTUALLY CONFIRM ONE THE RISING THE SETTING OF THE SUN IS THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SYNCRNIZE YOURSELF TO I'M FASCINATED BY THE CIRCATEAN CLOCK AND THE FACT THAT ALL THE SELLS OF OUR BODY HAVE ESSENTIALLY AT TWENTY FOUR HOUR ISH CLOCK IN THEM RIGHT WE ARE A LOT ABOUT THESE CIRCATIAN RHYTHIMS INCIRCUTEN CLOCKS THE FACT THAT WE NEED LIGHT IN PUT FROM THESE SPECIAL NURONS IN ORDER TO SET THE CLOCK BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY HEARD IT DESCRIBED HOW THE CLOCK ITSELF WORKS AND HOW THE CLOCK SIGNALS TO ALL THE REST OF THE BODY WHEN ON THE LIVERS SHOULD BE DOING ONE THING IN MAT ASTOMACH SHULD BE DOING ANOTHER I KNOW YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK ON THE CLOCK SO IF YOU WOULD JUST MAY BE BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHERE THE CLOCK IS WHAT IT DOES AND SOME OF THAT YOU KNO TOP CONTOUR OF HOW IT TELLS THE CELLS OF THE BODY WHAT TO DO I SO THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT IS YOU SAID THE CLOCK IS ALL OVER THE PLACE MOST OF THE TISSUES IN YOUR BODY HAVE CLOCKS I WE PROBABLY HAVE WHAT MILLIONS OF CLOCK YENO WE SAY THAT'S BETST PROMPTLY FAIR YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF SALTIPES YOU MIGHT MAY HAVE MILLIONS OF CLOCKS AM THAT THE ROLL OF THE CENTRAL PACEMAKER FOR THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM IS TO CO ORDINATE ALL OF THESE AND THIS IS ITIS A LITTLE NUCLIOUS A LITTLE A COLLECTION OF NERVE CELLS IN YOUR BRAIN THIS CALLED THE SUPERCAISMATIC NUCLEOUS THE S ND AH AND IT IS SITTING IN A FUNNY PLACE FOR THE REST OF THE STRUCTURES IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT YET DIRECT RETINAL LINPUT ITS SITTING IN THE HEYGHPOTH ALEMES WHICH YOU CAN THINK ABOUT AS SORT OF THE GREAT CO ORDINATOR OF DRIVES AND THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR PLEASURES AND ALL OUR PROBLEMS RIGHT OR MOST OUR PROBLEM YES IT REALLY IS BUT IT'S SORT OF U NOW DEEP IN YOUR BRAIN THINGS THAT DRIVE YOU O DO THINGS IF YOU FREEZING COLD YOU PUT ON A COD YOU YOU UOU SHIVERY ALL THESE THINGS ARE CO ORDINATED Y THE HYPOTALEMAS SO THIS PATHWAY TIT WERE TALKING ABOUT FROM THE RETNA AND FROM THESE PECUL OURSELVES THAT ARE ECODING LIGHT INTENSITY AR SENDING SIGNALS DIRECTLY INTO THE CENTER THAT'S SURROUNDED BY ALL OF THESE CENTERES THAT CONTROL AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND A YOUR CORMONAL SYSTEMS AM SO THIS IS A PART OF YOUR YOUR VITUAL SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T REALLY REACH THE LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU YOU THINK ABOUT IT'S HAPPENING UNDER THE RAID OUR KIND OF ALL THE TIME AH IN THE SIGNAL IS WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE THIS CENTRAL CLOCK CO ORDINATING CENTR NOW WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS NOT THAT WELL UNDERSTOOD BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS A NERAL CENTR THAT HAS THE SAME ABILITY TO COMMUNIATE WITH OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN IS ANY OTHER NERAL CENTR AN CLEARLY THERE ARE CIRCUITS THAT INVOLVE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURONS THAT A YOUO ARE RCONVENTIONAL BHEN IN EDITION IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THERE ARE ALSO SER HUMORAL EFFECTS THAT THINGS ARE BEING AR OSING OUT OF THE CELLS AH IN THE CENTERE AND MAY BE INTO THE CIRCULATION OR OR JUST A DIFFUSING THROUGH THE BRAIN TO SOME EXTENT THAT CAN ALSO EFFECT A NER ONS ALLSWEARE BUT THE HPATHALEMES USES EVERYTHING TO CONTROL THE REST OF THE BODIES AND THAT'S TRUE THE SUPERCASMATIC NEUCLYAS THIS THIS CIRCADIAN CENTER IS WELL AH IT CAN GET ITS FINGEROUS INTO THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE HUMORAL SYSTEM AND OF COURSE UP TO THE CENTERS OF THE BRAIN THAT ORGANIZED CO ORDINATED RATIONAL BEHAVIOR SO FI UNERSTAND CORRECTLY WE HAVE THE SCRUP OF CELLS THE SUPERCOS MAGNUCLEUS IT'S GOT A TWENTY FOUR HOUR WHITHEM THAT RHYTHM IS MORE OR LESS MATCH TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR EXTERNAL WORLD BY THE SPECIALIZED SET OF NERANS IN OUR EYE BUT THEN THE THAT THE MASTER CLOCK ITSELF THE USS AND RELEASE IS THINGS IN THE BLOOD HUMORAL SIGNALS ON THAT GO OUT VERIOUS PLACES IN THE BODY AND THE SAID TO THE AUTONOMIC SYSTEM WHICH IS REGULATING MOR LESS ON ALERT OR CALM WE ARE AS WELL AS OUR THINKING IN OUR COGNITION I'M SO THE I LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC PART A PRESUMELY THAT'S THROUGH MELETONAN IT'S THROUGH ON A DRENTLAN HOWHOW IS IT THAT THAT OF THIS CLOCK IS IMPACTING HOW THE AUTONOMIC SYSTEM HOW ALERT OR CALM WEEP WE FEEL RIGHT SO THERE THERE ARE PATHWAYS BY WHICH THE SUPERCASMATIC NECLEAS CAN ACCESS WITH THE PARIS MPATHETIC AND SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST SO PEOPLE KNOW THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ONE THAT TENDS TO MAKE US MORE ALERT THAN THE PARISYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THE PORTION OF THE AUTONOMINERVOUS SYSTEM MAKES US FEEL MORE CALM RIGHT IN IN BROUGHT COFIRST YET  TO FIRST APPROXIMATION WRIGHT SO THIS IS BOTH OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM THROUGH HRYPITHYLAMIC CIRCUIS ONE OF THE CIRCUITS THAT WILL BE I THINK OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO SOME OF YOUR LISTSTERIS IS A PATHWAY THAT INVOLVES THIS SYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT SYSTEM THIT IS ACTUALLY THROUGH A VERY SUCURIOUS RUTE INTERVATING THE PINEEL GLAND WHICH IS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR BRAIN THE SO CALLED THIRD EYE RIGHT SO THIS IS LOV TO GET BACK TO WHY IT'S CALL THE THIRD EYE BECAUSE YE THAT'S AN INTERESTING HAN ALTAGANGS THA THIRD EYE AND THAT ANJUSTED YOU KNOW TOS LEAVE AT THIRSLEAVE IT THERE RIGHT RIGHT ANYWAY THIS IS THE MAJOR SOURCE OF MELOTONE INTE YOUR BODY SO LIGHT COMES IN TO MY EYE YES PASSED OFF TO THE SUPERGISE MATIC NUCLLEUS ESENTUALLY NOT THE LIGHT ITSELF BUT THE THE SITTING AL REPRESENTING THE LIGHT SURE THEN THE ES  AND THE SUPEROGISE MAGNUCALIIS CAN IMPACT THE MALETONAN SYSTEM RIGHT V VY THE PINEEL RIGHT THE WAY THIS IS SEEN IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO MEASURE YOUR MELOTONE AND LEVEL OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY IF YOU COUL DO THIS YOU KNOW HOUR BY HOUR YOU'D SEE THAT IT'S REALLY LOW DURING THE DAY VERY HIGH AT NIGHT BUT IF YOU GET UP N THE THE NIGHT AND GO TO THE BATHROM AND TURN ON THE BRIGHTFUL OR AT FLOORCAN LIGHT YOUR MELOTONEA LEVEL IS SLAM TO THE FLOOR LIGHT IS DIRECTLY IMPACTING YOUR HORE MORTAL LEVELS O THROUGH THIS MECHANISM THAT WE JUST DESCRIBED SO THIS IS ONE OF THE ROUTS BY WHICH LIGHT CAN ACT ON YOUR OR MORTAL STAT IS TO PATHWAYS THAT ARE COMPLETELY BEYOND WHAT YOU NORMALLY WOULD THINK ABOUT RIGHT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE THE THINGS IN THE BATH REVL THERE'S THE TOOTH BRUSE NOR THIS THE TUBE OF TOOTHBAYS BUT MEANWHILE THIS OTHER SYSTEM IS JUST COUNTING PHOTONS AND SAYING OH WHAT ITS LOT OF POTONS RIGHT NOW LET'S SHUT DOWN THE MELETONE AND RELEASE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY I'VE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT NOT JUST BLUE LIGHT BUT BRIGHT LIGHT OF ANY WAVE LENGTH BECAUSE THERE'S THE SMYTH OUT THERE THAT BLUE LIGHT BECAUSE IT'S THE OPTIMAL SIGNAL FOR ACTIVATING THIS PATHWAY AND SHUTTING DOWN MELATONE AND IS THE ONLY WAVE LENGTH OF LIGHT THAT CAN SHUT IT DOWN BUT IM I CORRECT IN THINKING THAT IF A LIGHT IS BRIGHT ENOUGH RIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER OF ITS BLUE LIGHT GREEN LIGHT PURPLE LIGHT EVEN RED LIGHT RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO SLAM MELLATONE AND DOWN TO THE GROUND WHICH IS NOT A GOOD THING TO HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT RIRCT RIGHT M ANY ANY LIGHT WILL AFFECT THI SYSTEM TO SOME EXTENT THE BLUE LIGHT IS SOMEWHAT MORE EFFECTIVE BUT DON'T FULL YOURSELF TO IN INTO THINKING THAT IF YOU USE RED LIGHT THAT MEANS YOUR YOU KNOW YOU'RE AVOIDING THE EFFECT YOU SIS CERTAINLY STILL THERE AND CERTAINLY TIT'S VERY BRIGHT IT'LL BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DRIVING THE SYSTEM THAN DIM BLUE LIGHT WOULD BE INTERESTING A LOT OF PEOPLE WEAR BLUE LOCKERS OM AND IN A KIND OF ODD TWIST OF MISS INFORMATION OUT THERE A A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEAR BLUE LOCKERS DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHICH FASTICALLY MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IS WHEN YOU WANT TO GET A LOT OF BRIGHT LIGHT AND INCLUDING BLUE LIGHT INTO YOUR EYES CORRECT ABSOLUTELY AND NOT JOUS FOR THE REASONS WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF CIRCATIAN EFFECTS THERE MAJOR EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON MOON AH AND SEESAL EFFECTIVE DISORDER APPARENTLY IS ESSENTIALLY A REFLECTION OF THIS SAME SYSTEM IN REVERSE IF YOURE LIVING IN THE NORTHERN CLIMES AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT MUCH LIGHT DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE THE WINTER IN STOCK OM AM YOU MIGHT BE PRO INTO DEPRESSION AND PHOTOF THERE IF YOU MIGHT BE JUST THE TICKET FOR YOU AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A DIRECT EFFECT OF LIGHT ON MOOD DAS THERE'SNAT EXAMPLE WHERE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LIGHT IT'S A PROBLEM SO I THINK YOURE EXACTLY RIGHT IS NOT ABOUT IS LIGHT GOOD OR BAD FOR YOUSE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF LIGHT AND WHEN AH THAT THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE AT THE GENERAL WILL AV THUMB THAT I'VE BEEN LIVING BY IS TO GET AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT IN MY EYES IDEALLY FROM SUNLIGHT ANY TIME I WANT TO BE ALERT RTAND DOING EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE WHEN I WANT TO BE ASLEEP YWE'RE GETTING DROWSY AND AND THERE THEERE ASPECTS OF THIS THAT IT SPIN OUT WAY BEYOND THE CONVERSATION WERE HAVING NOW TO THINGS LIKE THIS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE INCIDENTS OF MY OPIA NEOR SUDDENNESS YOUR SIGHTEDNESS RIGHT IS STRONGLY RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT KIDS SMEND OUT DOORS AND IN WHAT DIRECTION OF EFFECT THE MORE THEY SPEND TIME OUTDOORS THE LESS MEAR SIGHTEDNESS THEY HAVE SO TIT TLLS OUT BECAUSE THEIRE VIEWING THINGS AT A DISTANCE OR BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF BLUE LIGHT IS A SUNLIGHT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION IT IS NOT FULLY RESOLVE WHAT THE EPIDEMEOLOGICAL WHAT THE BASIS OF THAT EBIDEMEOLOGICAL FINDING IS ONE POSSIBILITY IS THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH WOULD MAKE ME THINK ABOUT THIS MEONOBSIN SYSTE AGAIN BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE A QUESTION OF ACCOMMODATION THAT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH YOU FOCUSS ON NEAR OR FAR THINGS IF YOU'RE NEVER OUT DOORS EVERYTHING IS NEAR BY IF YOU'RE OUT DOORIS YOUR FOCUSSING FAR SANS US HERE ON YOUR FHON RIGHT EXACTLY WHICH THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INTERESTS THESE DAYS IN YOUR WATCHES AND THINGS THAT COUNT STEPS AT BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE A DEVICE THAT CAN COUNT FOTONS DURING THE DAY AND CAN ALSO COUNT FOTONS AT NIGHT AND TELL US HAY YOUE GTTING TOO MANY FOTONS YOUE GIN A SHUT DOWN YOUR MELETONE AN AT NIGHT OR YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH FOTONS TO DAY YOU DIDN'T GETT ENOUGH BRIGHT LIGHT WHETHER NOTS FROM ARTIFICIAL LIGHTER FROM SUNLIGHT THAT I GUESS THE WHERE WOULD YOU PUT I ESY BOLLANT OP YOUR HEAD OR YOU PROUBABLY WANT IT SOME PLACE OUTWARD FACING RIGHT IT BUPROBABLY WHAT YOU NEED IS AS MANY FOTONS OVER AS MUCH OF THE RETIN AS POSSIBLE TO RECRUIT AS MUCH OF THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW AS POSSIBLE IN THINKING ABOUT OTHER EFFECTS OF THIS NON IMAGE FORMING PATHWAY ATHAT INVOLVES THESE SPECIAL SELLS IN THE EYE IN THESEE AND YOU HAD A PAPER A FEW YEARS AGO LOOKING AT RETINAL IN PUT TO AN AIRY OF THE BRAIN I WHICH HAS A FANCY NAME THE PRY HOBENULA BUT NAMESTON'T NECESSARILY MATTER THAT HAD SOME IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON MOOD AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OF LIGHT BUT MAYBE YOU TELL ASYLOBIT ABOUT WHAT IS THE PERRY HOBENULA OH WELL SO THAT'S A FANCY TERM BUT I THINK THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IS A CHUNK OF THE BRAIN THAT IS SITTING AS PART OF A BIGGER CHUMP THAT'S REALLY THE LINKER BETWEEN PERFERAL CENSORY IN PUT OF ALL KINDS VIRTUALLY ALL KINDS A WHETHER IT'S AUDITORY IN PUD OR TACTILE IN PUT A OR VISUALIN PUT TO THE REGION OF YOUR BRAIN THE QUARTEX THAT ALLOWS YOU TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS AND MAKE PLANS AROUND THEM AND TO INTEGRATE THEM IN THAT THAT KIND OF THING A SO A YOU NOW WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT A PATHWAY THAT GETS FROM THE RETNA THROUGH THIS SORT OF LINKER CENTERE SCALLED THE THALAMIS AND THEN ON NOT SYCA TRINGITASEXACTLY BUT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT THE DESTINATION RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GRANDCENTRAL AND NOW YOU CAN DO U YOUR THING AS YOU'RE UP AT THE QUARTEX SO THIS IS THE THE STANDARD PATTERN YOU HAVE SINCE YOR INPUT COMING FROM THE PRIFERY YOU'VE GOT THESE PRIFERAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE YOURE DOING THE INITIAL STAGES OF THE A THE I O SKIN OF YOUR FINGER TIPS RAIN NOW THAT THE TASTEBUDS ON YOUR TONGUE THEY'RE TAKINGS RAW INFORMATION IN AND THEY'RE DOING SOME PREPROCESSING MAYBE OR YOU THE EARLY CIRCUITS ARE BUT EVENTUALLY MOST OF THESE SIGNALS HALVE TO PASS THROUGH THE GATEWAY TO THE QUARTEC WHICH IS THE FHALAMIS AND WE'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS FOR FOR DECADES MANY DECKIS WHAT THE MAJOR THROU PUT PATHWAY FROM THE RETINA TO THE UARTE IS AND WHERE IT INDS UP INS UP INTHE VISUAL QUARTEX KNOW YOU PAT THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD THAT'S WHERE THE WERE THE RECEIVING THE CENTR IS FOR THE MAIN PATHWAY FROM RETNA TO GARTTEX BUT WAIT A MINUTE THERE'S MORE THERE'S THIS LITTLE SIDE PATHWAY IT GOES THO DIFFERENT PART OF THAT LINKING FALAMOUS CENTR THE GIINE TE CART LIKE A LOCAL TRAIN YA FROM GRAND CENTURALLAS INS IN A WEIRD PART OF THE NEBRO IT RIGHT IS T IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITS IT'S LIKE A LITTLE TRUNK LINE THAT BRANCHES OFF AND GOES OUT INTO THE HINTER LANDS AND IT'S GOING TO THE PART OF THIS LINKER CENTR THAT'S TALKING TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PART OF COURT TAKES WAY UP FRONT FRONTA LOBE WHICH IS MUCH MORE INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE PLANNING OR A SELF IMAGE OR SO I VERAGE LITERALLY HOW ON WITHA YOU US ONESELF AND IF YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF OR I NOT WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR NEXT THURSDAY A NOW IT'S IT'S A IT'S A VERY HIGH LEVEL CENTR IN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THIS IS THE REGION THAT IS GETTING INPOT FROM THIS PATHWAY WHICH IS MOSTLY WORKED OUT IN FUNCTION BY USANT RITARS LOVE I KNOW YOU HAD HIM ON THE POD CAN LEADEN TALK ABOUT THIS PATH THIS PATHWAY ALL RIGHT SO I A DAY OF A A FERNANDAS AND AND SAMERIN THE FOLKS AT WORK WITH THEM WE'RE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THIS PATHWAY DOESN'T EXIST AND GET YOU TO A WEIRD PLACE BUT IF YOU ACTIVE ATIT AT KIND OF THE WRONG TIME OF DAY ANIMALS CAN BECOME DEPRESSED AND IF YOU SILENCE IT UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES THEN WEIRD LIGHTING CYCLES THAT WOULD NORMALLY MAKE THEM ACT SORT OF DEPRESSED NO LONGER HAVE THAT EFFECT SO IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERES THIS PATHWAY FROM I TO THIS UNUSUAL TRAIN ROUT THROUGH THE THE STRUCTURE WE CALL THE THALAMIS THEN UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BRAIN THAT RELATES TO THINGS OF SELF PERCEPTION CAN A HIGHER LEVEL FUNCTIONS IV OIND THAT REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE MOST OF WHAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THESE FANCY WELL OR THES PRIMITIVE RATHER A NURANTS THAT DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE SHAPES OF THINGS BUT INSEID TO BRIGHTNESS I THINK OF WELL IT REGULATES MELL ATONE AN ECCIRCATING CLOCK MOOD HUNGER THE REALLY KIND OF AM VEGETATIVE SLIFE IF YOU WELL RIGHT AND THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCED DEPRESSION NOT JUST PEOPLE THAT LIVE AT YOU KNOW IN SCANANAVIAAN THE MI WINTER AND WE ARE VERY MUCH DIVORCED FROM OUR NORMAL INTERACTIONS WITH LIGHT IT ALSO MAKES ME REALIZE THAT THESE INTRINSICALLY FHOTO SENSITIVE CELLS THAT SET THE CLOCK ET CETERA AR 'N INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THINGS I MEAN THEY SEEM TO REGULATE A DOZEN OR MORE DIFFERENT BASIC FUNCTIONS I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM NOW WHICH IS THE ONE THAT RELATES OUR SENSE OF BALANCE SO I I LOVE BOATS BUT I HATE BEING ON THEM LOVE THE OCEAN FROM SHORE BECAUSE I GET INCREDIBLY SEASICK I'VE JUST IT'S ALF I THIMLAN GET SEA SICK IF I THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH AND ONCE I WENT ON A BOATSHEP I CAME BACK AND ACTUALLY GOTS I GOT MOTION SAK OR WASN'T SEASICK AS TOGH IT UPRAFTING SO THERE'S A SYSTEM THAT SOMEHOW GETS MESSED UP THAT WAS TELL US OF YOUR FEELING SICK TO LOOK AT THE HORIZON ET CETERA ET CETERA AND WHAT IS THE LINK BETWEEN OUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND OUR BALANCE SYSTEM AND WHY DOES IT MAKE ITS NOCIOUS SOMETIMES WHEN THE WORLD IS MOVING IN A WAY THAT WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO I EREALISE THIS IS A BIG QUESTION BECAUSE IT INVALVS I MOVEMENTS ET CETERA BUT LET'S MAYBE JUST WALK IN AT THE SIMPLEST LAYERS OF VISION VE STIBULAOR SOCLE BALANCE SYSTEM AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN PIECE THE SYSTEM TOGETHER FOR PEOPLE SAID HAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND AND THEN ALSO WE SHOULD GIVE THEM SOME TOOLS FOR ADJUSTING THERE A NARSI WHEN THERE AN THEIR VESTIBULOUS SYSTEM IS OT A WACK CO SO THAT I MEAN T THITK THE VERSING TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT IT IS TIBULAR SYSTEM IS I DESIGNE TO ALLOW YOUTO SEE HOW YOU'R ORE DETACT SENSE HOW YOU'R MOVING IN THE WORLD THROUGH THE WORLD AM IT'S A FUNNY ONE BECAUSE IT'S O YOUR MOVING IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE WORLD IN A SENSE AND YET IT'S SORT OF INTEROCEPTIVE IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS REALLY THE INSENSING THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR OWN BODY O CAUS OIN TERRUSEPTION WE SHOULD PROLY DELINATE FOR PEOPLE AS WHEN YOUR FOCUSSING ON YOUR INTERNAL STATE YETS S A TAING OUTSIDE YOU RIGHT SO IT'S IS IS IT A IT'S A GRAVITY SENSINCS IT'S IT WELL IT'S PARTLY A GRAVITY SENSING SYSTEM IN THE IN THE SENSE THAT GRAVITY IS A FORCE TIT'S ACTING ON YOU AS IF YOU WERE MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AREI NOW YOT EXAS A O O A CASE SO BASICALLY THE IDEA IS THAT UM IF WE LEAVE GRAVITY INSIDE WERE US SITTING IN IN A IN A CAR IN THE PASSENGER SEEN AND A DRIVER IT'S THE EXCELERATOR AND YOU START MOVING FORWARD YOU SENSE THAT IF YOUR EYES WERE CLOSE YOU'D SENSIT IF YOUR EARS WERE PLUGGED IN YOUR EYES WERE CLOSE YOU'D STILL KNOW IT THAT MANY PEOPLE TAKE OFF ON THE PLAIN LIKE THIS THER DREADING THE FLIGHT AND THEY KNOW ON IT THE PLAN IS TAKING UP SURE THAT'S YOUR VISTIBULAR SYSTEM TALKING BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT JOSTLES YOU OUT OF THE CURRENT POSITION YOU'R INRIGHT NOW WI'LL BE DETECTED BY THVE STIBULAR SYSTEM PRETTY MUCH A SO THIS IS A COMPLICATED SYSTEM BUT IT'S BASICALLY IN YOUR INNER YOUR EAR VERY CLOSE TO WHERE YOU'RE HEARIN HIM BUT IT THE I THENSAND I DON'T KNOW HY  IIS NO U ER DOT ARRIVED I' JUST GETTING AS TO STEAL OUR FRIEND ROS VAN GELDER'S EXPLANATION WE WEREN'T CONSULT TO THE DESIGN FASE AND KNOWN AS I THAT'S A GREATIN EYE THAT'S THAT'S THE REAT ONE AM BUT IT'S INTERESTING IT'S IN THE EAR YAH IT'S I YOT'S DEEP IN THERE AND IS SERVED BY THE SAME NERVE ACTUALLY IT'S SERVES THE HEARING SYSTEM ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS BOTH THE HEARING SYSTEM AND THE VESTIBULAR SELF MOTION SENSING SYSTEM ARE REALLY DETECTING THE SIGNAL IN THE SAME WAY THEYRE HAIRY CELLS AND THEYARE EXCITELY ER YES OR HAVE THEY GOT LITTLE SILLY AS STICKING UP OFF THE SURFACES AND DEPENDING ON WHICH WAY YOU BEND THOSE I SELSWILL EITHER BEINHIBITED OR EXCITED THEY'RE NOT EVEN NURONS BUT THEN THEY TALK TO NERANTS WITH A NRAN LIKE PROCES AND OFF YOU GO NOW YOU'VE GOT IN AUDITORY SIGNAL IF YOURE CENSING THINGS BOUNCING AROUND IN YOUR COXLY  WICOUS ISO SYMPATHETICALLY THE BOUNCING OF YOUR EAR DRUM WHICH IS INSYMPATHETICALLY THE SOUNDWAVES IN THE WORLD BUT IN THE CASE OF THE VESTIBULAR APPARATUS EVOLUTION IS BUILT TO SYSTEM THAT DETECTS THE MOTION OF SAY FLUID GOING BY THOSE HAIRS AND IF YOU PUT A CENSOR LIKE THAT IN TA TOO THAT'S FLUID FILLED NOW YOU'VE GOT A CENSOR THAT WILL BE ACTIVE ATED WHEN YOU WROTE TO AT THAT TOO AROUND THE ACCESS THAT PASSES THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF IT THOSE YOU WERE JUST LISTENING WN WON'T BE LA THE ANLY SAYS A OUSING OF IT IS THREE WHOLOPS  THREE WHOLON STANDING UP ONE LYING DOWN ON THE GROUND HAONE O THE OTHER ON THE OTHER  THREE AY DIRECTIONS I KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO FLY WILL TALK ABOUT ROLE PITCH IN YOALL THAT KIND OF THING SO THREE AXES OF IN COTING JUST LIKE IN THE COLMS OF THE VAS NO AND THEN I W SAY IT'S AND THEN THE PUPPY ED TILL YOUAV THA PUPPY HOOD TILL YES THAT'S THE OTHER ONE SO THA THE POINT IS THAT YOUR YOUR BRAIN IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNPACK WHAT THESE CENSORS ARE TELLING YOU ABOUT HOW YOU DISROTATED YOUR HEAD IN VERY MUCH THE WAY THAT THE THREE TYPES OF CONES WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE ARE READING THE IN COMING FOTONS IN THE WAVELINGTH DON' MEAN DIFFERENTLY AND IF YOU ENGER HEARINYET YOU THINK WEAR INTRUST TO GET READYIN BLUE SO  IT SEEMBISIC IDEA IF YOU HAVE THREE CENSORS IND YOU RAY THEM PROPERLY NOT EU CAN TELL IF YOURE ROTATING YOUR HEAD LEFT A RIGHT UPDOWN THAT'S THE CENSORY SIGNAL COMING BACK INTO YOUR BRAIN CONFIRMING THAT YOUV JUST MADE A MOVEMENT THAT YOU WILL BUT WHAT ABOUT ON THE PLAIN BECAUSE WHEN I'M ON THE PLAIN ON COMPLETE STATIONARY THE PLAINS MOVING  MY HEAD HASN'T M RIGHT SO I'M JUST MOVING FORWARD GRAVITYIS CONSTANT EXACTLY ASO AS I KNOW 'M EXILERING SO WAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS YOUR BRAIN IS SENSING THE MOTION AND THE THE BRAINS SMART ENOUGH ALSO TO TO ASK ITSELF DID I WILL THAT MOVEMENT OR DID THAT COME FROM THE OUTSIDE SO NOW TERMS OF SORT OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE THE VESTIBULAR SIGNAL MEANS IS GOT TO BE IMBEDDED IN THE CONTECT OF WHAT YOU TRIED TO DO OR WHAT U YOUR OTHER CENSURIES A SYSTEMS ARE TELLING YOU ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING I O SO A'S VERY INTERESTING I BUT IT'S NOT CONSCIOUS OR LEAST IF IT'S CONSCIOUS IS VER I NOT CONSCIOUS IT'S DEVILING VERY FAST RI THE MOMENT THAT PLAIN STARTS MOVING I KNOW THAT I DIDN'T GET UP AN INA CHAR AND RUN FORWARD RIGHT BUT I'M NOT REALLY THINKING AMY GETTING APBOUT IN MY CHAIR BUT STILL I GUESS THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS QUOTE AWARE AT MANY LEVELS WHEN IT GETS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE QUART JEXAND WERE THINKING ABOUT IT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW THAT'S CORTIGAL BUT THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE BRAIN THAT DON'T REQUIRE YOU TO ACTUALLY ACTIVELY THINK ABOUT IT THEY'RE JUST DOING THEIR THING ARE ALSO MADE AWARE RIGHT A LOT OF THIS IS HAPPENING UNDER THE SURFACE OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING THESE ARE REFLEXES  SO WE'VE GOT THIS GRAVITY SENSING SYSTEM RIGHT UM FOR I'M NOTING FOR THOSE EARLESSING FOR A YES MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD AND NO MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD OR THE TELTING OF THE HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND THEN YOU SAID THAT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT ACTIVATION OF THAT SYSTEM COMES FROM MY OWN MOVEMENTS OR SOMETHING ACTING UPON ME LIKE THE PLAIN MOVING HAS TO BE COMBINE WITH OTHER SIGNALS AND SO HOW IS THE VISUAL INFORMATION OR INFORMATION ABOUT THE VISUAL WORLD COMBINED WITH BALANCE INFORMATION RIGHT SO I MT I GUESS  MAYBE THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THESE TWO SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER IT'S TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SUDDENLY ROTINTE YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT WHEN YOU SUDDENLY WROTE TO YOUR HEAD O THE LEFT YOUR EYES ARE ACTUALLY ROTATING TO THE RIGHT AUTOMATICALLY YOU YOU DO THIS IN COMPLETE DARKNESS IF YOU HAD AN EYE   INFOR RED CAMERA AND WATCH YOURSELF IN COMPLETE DARKNESS YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING YOUROTINING YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT YOUR EYES WOULD ROTATE TO THE RIGHT THAT'S YOUR VISTIBULAR SYSTEM SAYING IT'S I'M GOING TO TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR THE HEAD ROTATION SO MY EYES ARE STILL LOOKING IN THE SAME PLACE WHY IS THAT USEFUL WELL IF IT'S ALWAYS DOING THAT THEN THE IMAGE OF THE WORLD ON YOUR RETINA WILL BE PRETTY STABLE MOST OF THE TIME AND THAT ACTUALLY HELPS VISION HAVE THEY BUILT HIS INTO TH CAMERAS FOR A IMAGE STABLISATION CAS WHEN I MOVE WHEN I TAKE A PICTURE WITH MY FONE IT'S BLURRY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT CLEAR WELL ACTUALLY YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET A BETTER FALL BECAUSE NOW WHAT THEY HAVE IS SOFT WARE IN THE BETTER ABS THAT WILL DO A KIND OF IMAGE STABLIZATION POST HAWK BY DOING A REGISTRATION OF THE IMAGES THAT ARE BOUNCING ROUND THEY SAY THIS THE EDGE OF THE HOUSE WAS HERE SO LET'S GET THAT ALINE AT EACH OF YOUR IMAGES SO YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE IF YOU'RE USING A GOOD NEW PHONE THAT IF YOU WALK AROUND A A LANDSCAPE AND HOLD YOUR FAN THAT YOU KNW THIS ALL THIS IMAGE TAPILIZATION GOING ON BUT T'S BUILT INTO STANDARD SCYNEMATIC YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY NOW BECAUSE WE TRY TO DO A HAND HOLD CAMERA THINGS WE BE BOUNCHING AROUND THINGS WUD BE UNWATCHABLE YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SCENE SO THE THE BRAIN WORKS REALLY HARD TO MOSTLY STABLIZE THE IMAGE OF THE WORLD ON YOUR EAD NEN O CORSE YOU'RE MOVING THROUGH THE WORLDS YOU CAN'T STABLIZE EVERYTHING BUT THE MORE YOU CAN STABLIZE MOST OF THE TIME THE BETTER YOU CAN SEE AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE'RE SCANNING A SCENE LOOKING AROUND AT THINGS WE'RE MAKING VERY RAPID I MOVEMENTS FOR VERY SHORT PERIODS OF TIME AND THEN WE DIREST BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT DO THAT IF YOU EVER WATCH A HUMMING BIRD DOES EXACTLY THE SAME THING AN A FEEDER RIGHT SHITIS  FOR TITS BODY YOULIT'S GOING TO MAKE A QUICK MOVEMENT AND THEN AS COUL BY STABLE AND WHEN YOU WATCH A PIGEON WALKING ON THE SIDE WALK IT DOES THIS FUNNY HEAD BOBBING THING BUT WHAT IS REALLY DOING IS RACKING ITS HEAD BACK ON ITS NACK WHILE ITS BODY GOES FORWARD SO THAT THE IMAGE OF THE VISUAL WORLD STAYSTATIC AS THAT WEATHER TO YES AND YU YOU'VE SEEN A FUNNY CHICKEN VEDIOS ON YOU TWO RIGHT YOU'VE TAKE OR CHICKEN MOVE IT UP AND DOWN THE HEASTAYS IN ONE PLACE IT'S ALL THE SAME THING ALL OF THESE ANIMALS ARE TRYING HARD TO KEEP THE IMAGE OF THE WORLDS STABLE ON THEIR RET INA AS MUCH OF THE TIME AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND THEN WHEN THEYVE GOT TO MOVE MAKE IT FAST MAKE IT QUICK AND THEN STABLE AS A GATOR THE PISINS OF THEIR HEADBAT IT IS WEL I MA CANCY TO PAUSE THERE FR AAAND THA JUST THAT AMAZIN UM CASE PEOPLE AREN'T UM WELL TTHERE'S NO REASON WHY PEOPLE WOULD KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT A SENTUALY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE BUILDING UP FROM CENSORY YOU KNOW LIGHT ON TO THE EYE MA COLOR TO WHAT THE BRAIN DOES WITH THAT THE  INTEGRATION OF THAT ASCIRCATING CLOCK MELLATONE ET CETERA AND NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS RETURNING ABOUT MOULTY SENSORY WERE MOULTY MOTIL COMBINING ONE SENSE VISEON WITH ANOTHER SENSE BALANCE RIGHT AND IT TURNS OUT THE PIGEONS NO MORE ABOUT THIS THAN I DO BECAUSE PIGEONS KNOW TO KEEP THEIR HEADBACK AS THEY WALK FORWARD RIGHT ALL RIGHT SO THAT GETS US TO THIS ISSUE OF MOTION SICKNESS RIGHT AND IF YOU DONT HAVE TO GO OUT ON A BOAT ANY TIME I GO TO NEW YORK I SIT IN AN UBER OR IN A CAB IN THE BACK AND IF I'M LOOKING AT MY PHONE WHILE THE CARS DRIVING I FEEL NATIOUS BY TIME I ARRIVE AT MY DESTINATION RIGHT I ALWAYS TRY AND LOOK OUT THE FRONT OF THE WIND SHIELD BECAUSE I'M TOLD THAT HELPS BUT IT'S A LITTLE TINY WINDOW RIGHT AND I ENOVE FEELING SLIGHTLY LESS SICK IF I DO THAT SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE VISION AND THE BALANCE SYSTEM THAT CAUSES THE KIND OF A NAUSEA AND I SHL IF I KEEP TOK O THE CITY OLI DON'T THROW UP EASILY BUT UM BUT FOR SOME REASON MOTION SICKNESS AS IT IS A REAL THING FOR IT'S A PROPER LOT OF PEOPLE IMN I THINK THROG THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM TIPIDLLY WHEN YOU GET MOTION SICK IS WHAT THEY CALL VISUAL VISTIBULAR CONFLICHT THAT IS YOU HAVE TWO CENSORY SYSTEMS THEY'RE TALKING TO YOUR BRAIN ABOUT HOW YOU'RE MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD AND AS LONG AS THEY AGREE YOU'RE BINE SO IF YOU'RE DRIVING YOU KNOW YOU'RE BODY SENSES THAT YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD YOUR VISTIBURO SYSTEMS YOU IS IS PICKING UP THIS EXCELERATION OF THE CAR AN YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IS SEEING THE CONSEQUENCES AFORWARD MOTION IN THE SWEEPING OF THE SCENE PAST TO YOU EVERYTHING IS HAWKY DOORY WRIHT NO PROBLEM BUT WHEN YOU ARE HEADED FORWARD BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOURSELF ON WHAT IS YOUR RETNESSING YOUR RETNESS SEEING THE STABLE IMAGE OF THE SCREEN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO MOTION IN THAT WOR THE MOTION ISOR SOME OTHER MOTIN AT SOME MONGOFYOUR ITY IF YOU'RE PLAYING A GAME OR YOU'RE WATCHING O VEDIO A FOOTBALL GAME YOU KNOW THE MOTION IS UNCOUPLED WITH WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING TO YOUR BODY YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T LIKE THAT YOUR BRAIN LIKES EVERYTHING TO BE IT A LINE AND IF IT'S NOT IT'S GOINGTO COMPLAIN TO YOU A TON YOU MAY FEEL NI MAKINS IF YOEL NOXIOUS AND MAY BEU'LL CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIORS SO YOU'RE GETTING AN GAING PUNISHED YAH FOR FOR FOR FOR SETTING IT UP SO ISAN LIN LIT RIT BY THE VESTIBULAR YOU'LL LEARN VISUALS IN TI I LOVE IT M I LOVE THE IDEA OF OF REWARD SIGNALS AND WE'VE DONE A LOT OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SON THE POTGAST OF THINGS LIKE DOPENMING REWARD AND THINGS BUT ALSO PUNISHMENT SIGNALS AND THEM I LOVE THIS EXAMPLE A WELL MAYBE MARCHING A LA BIT FURTHER ALONG THIS PATHWAY AM VISUAL IN PUT IS COMBINED WITH BALANCE IN PUT WHERE DOES THAT OCCUR AND MAYBE CAUSE I HAVE SOME HINT OF WHERE IT OCCURS I YOU COULD TELL SO LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS A KIND OF MYSTERIOUS LMANY BRAIN AH THAT THE CALL THE SARAPAROWE YE SO YOU KNOW THE WAY I TRYED TO DESCRIBE THE SERABELLAM TO MY STUDENTS IS THAT IT SERVES SORT OF LIKE THE ERITRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM FUNCTIONS IN HOUR TRAVELE SO THAT IT'S A SYSTEMS VERY COMPLICATED AN IS REALLY DEPENDENT ON GREAT INFORMATION SO IT'S TAKIN IN INFORMATION ABOUT EVERYTHING THAS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE NOT ONLY THROUGH YOUR SENSORY SYSTEMS BUT IS LISTENING INTO ALL THE LITTLE CENTERE IS ELSEWHERE IN YOUR BRAIN THEY'RE CONFUTING WHAT YOU GNG TO BE DOING NEXT AND SO FORTH SO IT'S JUST RAPENEUS FOR THAT KIND OF INFORMATION SO T REALLY IS LIKE A LO MANY BRAY IT IS AS IT'S IT'S GOT ACCESS TO ALL THOSE SIGNALS AM AND IT REALLY HASNAN IMPORTANT RULE IN CAN IN IN COORDINATING AND SHAPING MOVEMENTS BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU SUDDENLY ELIMINATED OUR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM PLAINTS COULD STILL TAKE OFF AND LAND BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME UNHAPPY  ACCIDENTS ININ THE PROCESS SO THE SERABLUM'S GONLIKE THAT IT'S NOT THAT YOU WOULD BE PARALYZED IF YOUR SAR SERABALEM WAS GONE BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE MOTORMARADS YOU STOP WAYS TO TALK TO YOUR MUSCLES A YOU STILL HAVE REFLEX CENTERS AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU OUD HAVE ANY SENSORY LOSS BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE YOUR QARTIX GETTING ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL SIGNALS THAT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE CO ORDINATING THINGS SO WELL ANY MORE THE TIMING BETWEEN INPUT AND OUTPUT MIGHT BE OFF OR IF YOU WERE TRYING TO PRACTICE A NEW ATHLETIC MOVE LIKE AN OVERHEAD SERVIN TENIS YOU' BE JUSTERRIBLE AT LEARNING THAT ALL THE SEQUENCES OF MUSCLE MOVEMENTS AND THE FEED BACK FROM YOUR CENSORIES APPARATUS THAT WOULD LET YOU REALLY GET THAT BALL EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANTED TO AFTER THE ENTH REP BRIGHTENING O THE THOUSANDTH REP OR SOMETHING GET MUCH BETTER AT IT SO THE SERBONES ALL INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE MOTOR LEARNING AND REFINING THE PRECISIONS OF OF MOVEMENTS SO THAT THEY GET YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IF YOU REACH FOR A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE THAT YOU DON'T KNOCK IT OVER OR STOPP SHORT A YIT HAS ET YOGEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE SELECTIV DAMAGE TO THE SARABELLUM ABSOLUTELY AND AND WHAT I CAM FAMILIAR WITH AM COURSICOUGHS IS IS DIFFERENT RIGHT ISN'T THAT O BEVITEM INDEFICIENCY FROM INCHRONICALCA HOLLIN WY AND THEY HAVE A THEY TEND O WALK ON A BOW LEGGED AND THEY CAN'T CORNATE THEIR MOVEMENTS IS THAT THAT HAS SOME THAT I'M HURE AMERYS AYOLEER ALSO SARABELLUM I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE SARBELLER INVOLVEENT THERE BUT YOU KNOW THEY THE TYPICAL THING WOULD BE UM A PATIENT HAS A SARABELLEAR STROKE OR A TOMOR FOR EXAMPLE AM MIGHT BE AM NOT THAT STEADY ON THEIR FEET YOU KNOW IF IF THE A YOU KNOW DYNAMICS OF THE SITUATION YOU STANDING ON A S ON A STREET CAR WITH YOUR  WITH NOT TO PULL THE WHOLE ON TO THEY MIGHT NOT BE AS GOOD IT ADJUSTING ALL THE LITTLE MOVEMENTS OF THE CAR AM ND KOW THIS A KIND OF TREMOR THAT CAN OCCUR AS THEIR REACHING FOR THINGS AM BECAUSE TTHEY REACH A LITTLE TOO FAR AND THN THEY OVER CORRECT AND COME BACK A THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S IT'S UM VERY COMMON NERALOGICAL A PHENOMENON ACTUALLY A SARBELLER A TAXIES IS WHAT THE NAURALEGIS CALL IT AND IT CAN HAPPE NOT JUST WITH SARABELOR DAMAGE BUT DAMAGE TO THE TRACTS THAT FEED THE INFORMATION INTERA SARABELL AN EVI IT STRUCTURES ACTLY OR OUTPUT FROM THE SARABELLUM AND SO THE ARABELLUM IS WEAR A LOT OF VISUAL AND AND BALANCE INFORMATION IS COMBINED IN A VERY KEEF PLACE IN THE SARABELLUM WHICH IS A IT'S REALLY ONE OF THE OLDEST PARTS INTIMES OF EFLOLES THE FLOCCULOUS RIGHT THIS IS ITY IT'S A CRITICAL PLACE IN THE SARABELLUM WERE VISUAL IN THE STIMULAR INFORMATION COMES TOGETHER FOR CORTING JUST THE KINDS OF MOVEMENTS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS IMAGE STABILIZING NETWORK ITS ALL HAPPENING THERE AND THERE'S LEARNING HAPPENING THERE AS WELL SO THAT IF YOUR VESTIBUTAR APPARATUS IS A LITTLE BIT DAMAGE SOMEHOW YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY TALKING TO YOUR SARABELLUM SAYING THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE THERE'S AN ERROR AND YOUR SARABILLUM IS LEARNING TO DO BETTER BY INCREASING THE OUTPUT OF THE THE STIBULAR SYSTEM TO COMPENSATE FOR WHATEVER THAT LOSS WAS SO I'S A LITTLE IRRECORRECTION SYSTEM THAT SORT OF TYPICAL OF SARABELLER FUNCTION AND IT CAN HAPPEN IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT TO MES THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE DOMAINS OF SENSURY MOTOR INTEGRATION THAT AT EXPLAIN SIR I SHOULD SAY OFF MY FON IN THE UVERS IF AMON A BOAT I SHOULD ASSENTIY LOOK AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ACT AS IF I'M DRIVING THE THE MACHINE RIGHT I'M THOT' BEWEARED IF I WAS IN THE PASSENERS SEET PRETENDING ON STRIVING THE MACHINE BUT I DO ALWAYS FEEL BETTER FROM SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER RIGHT SOER OF THE OF THE VISUAL WORLD THAT YOU CAN SEE AS IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY THE ONE DOING THEM WI MOTION I WOULD THINK BUT'S STAY IN THE INNER EAR FOR A MINUTE AS WE CONTINUED A MARCH AROUND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WHEN YOU TAKE OFF IN THE PLAIN OR WHEN YOU LAND OR SOMETIMES THE MILL O THERE YOUR EARS GET CLOGED NLYST MY EARS GET CLOGGED THAT'S BECAUSE OF PRESSURE BUILD UP IN THE VARIOUS TUBES OF THE INNER EAR ET CETERA WILL GET INTO THIS BUT YEARS AGO OUR GOOD OUR GOOD FRIEND HARVEY CARTON IS A ANOTHER WORLD CLASS NEUR ANATAMIST GIVE A LECTURE AND IT TALKED ABOUT HOW PLUGGING YOUR NOSE AND BLOWING OUT VERSES PLUGGING YOUR NOSE AND SUCKING IN CAN SHOULD BE DONE AT DIFFERENT TIMES DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOURE TAKING OFF OR LANDING AND I ALWAYS SEE PEOPLE TRY TO UNPOP THEIR EARS RIGHT AND WHEN YOU YOU SCOUDAVING YOU LEAR HOW TO DO THIS WITHOUT NECESSARILI CAN TO IT I MY JUST CON TO MOVING MY JAHN NOW CAS AVE DONE IT UTLL BIT OF DIVING BUT WHAT'S THE STORY THERE I'M WE DON'T HAE TO GET INTO ALL THE DIFFERENCES IS AN ATMOSPHEREIC PRESSURE ET CETERA BUT FROM TAKEN OFF IN MY EARS ARE PLUGGED YOURE H'VE RECENTLY ASCENDED PLAR AG OFF MYARS ARE PLUGGED DO I PLUGG MY NOSE AND BLOW OUT OR Y PLUGG MY NOSE AND SUCK AND RIGHT SO T VASTIC IDEA IS THAT IF YOU ARE EARS FEEL BAD BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING INTO AN AREA OF HIGHER PRESSURE SO T A PRESSURE RISE THE CABIN MORE THAN TE PRESSURE THAT YOU HAVE ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET YOUR EAR DRUMS WULD BE BENDING IN AND THEY DON'T LIKE THAT YOU MIG PUSH A MORE THAL HER EVEN AT SINGLE DESCRIPTION THAT HYOU KNOW THE PRESSURE GOES UP THEN HOGES BANDAND ANT IN IN IN THE REVERSE WOULD BE TRUE IF YOU GO INTO AN AIRIVE LOW PRESSURE SO IF YOU KNOW  STARDING TO DRIVE UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE YOU'RE THE PRESSIOUS GETTING LOWER AND LOWER OUTSIDE NOW THE INSIDE THE EAR BEHIND YOUR YOUR DRUM IS BALLOOMI OUT YE RIGHT SO I'S JUST A QUESTION OF N ARE YOU TRIN TO GET MORE PRESSURE OR LESS PRESSURE BEHIND THE EAR DRUM IN THIS LITTLE TUBE THAT DOES THEN COMES DOWN INTO YOUR N VACCUR THROAT THERE AND YOU FORCE PRESSURE UP THAT TOO YOU CAN BE PUTTING MORE EAR PRESSURE INTO THE COMPARTMENT TE COUNTER I DIF IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND IF YOU'RE SUCKING YOU'RE GOING THE OTHER WAG IN REALITY I THINK AS LONG AS YOU OPEN THE PASSAGE WAY I THINK THAT DIFPRESSURE DIFFERENTIALS CAN SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS I THINK YOU COULD ACTUALLY BLOW IN WHEN YOU'RE NOT QUOTES POSE TO ESSO YOU COULD JUST BROLG YOUR NOSE AND BLOW EIR OUT OR HOLD YOUR NOSE AND SUCK IN THE RIGHT A FACT EITHER WAYS FINE I THINK SO I M ACELLENT YOU JUST I JUST ONE A HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM R I N VERY MUCH AS A LOCK WE HARVY NIZE THE TEACHINER ANATOMY TOGETHER ELSE I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS BUT THANK YOU RS IL I'LL SPLIT IL'L SPLIT THAT WITH YOU  ON THI IS A THIS IS IMPORTANC STUFF A BUT BUT ITS SURE YOU HEAR THIS YOU KNOW SO SO IT DOESN'T MATTER E OTHER WAY I I KNO EXPERT IN THIS AREA DONWERY DON'T WON'T MES NI CAN A N  ON  BUT O CASE SO  WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE INNER YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT THE SARABELUM I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AN AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT IS RARELY DISCUSSED WHICH IS THE MID BRAIN YET AND FOR THOSE THE DON'T KNOW THE MID BRAIN IS AN AREA BENEATH THE CARTAX I GUSS WE NEVER REALLY TDEFIND CUARTEX WAS AOUTER LAYERS OR ARE THE OUTER LAYERS OF THE LEAST MAMALIAN BRAIN AR HUMAN BRAIN  BUT THE MID BRAIN IS SUPERINTERESTING BECAUSE IT CONTROLS A LOT OF UNCONSCIOUS STUFF REFLEXES ET CETERA AND THEN THERE'S THIS PHENOMENON EVEN CALLED BLIND SIGHT SO COULD PLEASE TELL US ABOUT THE MIDBRAIN ABOUT WHAT IT DOES AND WHAT IN THE WORLD IS BLIND SIGHT YES SO THIS IS A IE'S A LOT OF PIECES THERE A I THINK THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS IF YOU IMAGINE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN YOUR MIND'S EYE YOU SEE THIS BIG HAUNKING BRAIN AND THEN THI IS LITTLES SINTHIN LITTLE A ON THAT DANGLES DOWN INTO YOUR VERTIWAL CAL THE SPINAL CORD AND THAS KIND OF YOUR VISUAL IMPRESSION AM WHAT YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IS STARTING IN THE SPINAL CRND WORKING YOUR WAY UP INTO THIS BIG MAGNIFICENT BRAIN AND WHAT YOU WOULD DO AS YOU ENTER THE SKULL IS GET INTO A LITTLE PLACE WHERE THE SPINAL CORKON A THICKENS OUT IT STILL HAS THAT SORT OF LONG SCHEMY TRUNK LIKE FEELINGS WERE LIKE A PADDLE OR A SPOONSHAPE RIGHT IT STRETCHED SPREAD OUT A LITTLE BUT THASK AS YOUR OU EVOLUTIONIS PACKED MORE INTERESTING GOODIES IN THERE FOR PROCESSING INFORMATIONIN AND GENERATING MOVEMENT SO BEYOND THAT IS THIS TWEEN BRAIN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TUS LING THIS LINKER RAIN WITH DYING SUFFLEON REALLY MEANS THE THE BETWEEN ROA THAS ATWEEN ALL YES YETS NONE A O TWEN BETTWWEEN AS ASINMENT SAID TWEEN TATS THE BEWEEN IT'S AT BETWEEN BRAIN AS IS WHAT THE THE NAME MEANS IS THE LINKER FROM THE SPINAL CORD IN THE PERIFERY UP TO THESE GRAND CENTERS OF THE QUARTE BUT THIS MID BRAIN YOURE TALKING ABOUT IS THE LAST BIT OF THIS ENLARGED SORT O SPINAL CORTY THING IN YOUR SKULL WHICH IS REALY THE BRAINSTEM IS WHAT WE CALL IT THE LAST BID OF THAT BEFORE YOU GET TO THIS REWAY UP TO THE QUARTEX IS THE MID BRAIN AND THIES WAE REALLY IMPORTANT VISUAL CENTER THERE IT'S CALLED THE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS AH THERE'S A SIMILAR CENTERE IN THE BRAINS OF OTHER VERTERATE ANIMALS OF FROG FOR EXAMPLE OR A LIZARD WOULD HAVE THIS IS CALED THE OPTIC TECTUM THERE BUT IT'S ON A CENTERE THEN IN THESE NON MAMALIAN A VERTEBRASES IS REALLY THE MAIN VISUAL CENTRE AH THEN REALLY HAVE WHAT WE D CALL A VISUAL QARTEXLE OF THERE'S SOMETHING SORT OF LIKE THAT BUT THIS WHERE MOST OF THE ACTION IS IN TERMS OF INTERPRETING VISUAL INPUT AND OF ORGANIZING BEHAVIOR AROUND THAT YOU CAN SORT OF THINK ABOUT THE THIS REGION OF THE BRAINSTEM IS A REFLEX CENTER THAT CAN RE ORNIENT THE ANIMALS A GAZE OR BODY OR MAY BE EVEN ATTENTION TO PARTICULAR REGIONS OF SPACE OUT THERE AROUND THE ANIMAL AND THAT COULD BE ALL FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS I MN IT MIGHT BE APPREDITOR TIS SHOWED UP IN ONE CORNER OF THE FOREST AND YOU PICK THAT UP AN YOUR TRYING TO AVOID IT WHICH IS ANY MOVEMENT MANY MOVEMENT RIGHT IT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW THAT SUDDEN WY A YOU KNOW SOMETHING SPLATS ON THE PAGE WHEN YOUARE READING A NOVEL AND AND YOUR EYE REFLECTLY LOOKS AT IT YOU'RE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT THAT'S A REFLEX WHAT IF YOU THROW ME O BALL I'M NOT EXPECTING IT RIGHT I JUST REACH UP IN AND TRYING RABIT RIGCHET OR NOT RIGHT IS THAT TO HANDLED BY THE MIDBRAND WELL THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE MID BRAIN ALTHOUGH IT COMING BY ITSELF BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO INVOLVE ALL THESE LIM MOVEMENTS THIS MOVEMENT OF YOUR ARM AND BODY AH AND WAS I PDUCKING AN THAT O SUDDENLY THROWN AGAHAD SURE RIGHT THINGS LIKE THAT ORT WILL CERTAINLY HAVE A BRAINSTEM COMPONENT AMIDBRAIN COMPONENT ONO SOMETHING LOOMS AND YOU DOCK A IT MAY NOT BE THE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW MIGHT BE ANOTHER PART OF THE VISUAL MIDBRAIN BUT THESE ARE CENTERS THAT EMERGED EARLY IN THE EVOLUTION OF BRAINS LIKE HOURS TO HANDLE COMPLICATED VISUAL EVENTS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE ANIMAL IN TERMS OF SPACE WER IS IT IN SPACE AND IN FACT THI SAME CENTER ACTUALLY GETS INPUT FROM ALL KINDS OF OTHER CENSORY SYSTEMS THAT TAKE INFORMATION FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD FROM PARTICULAR LOCATIONS AND WHERE YOU MIGHT WANTO EITHER AVOID OR APPROACH THINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU SO YOU GETTING PUT FROM THE TOUCH SYSTEM YO GETTING PUT FROM THE AUDITORY SYSTEM I WORK FOR A WHILE IN RATTLESNAKES THEY GETTING PUT FROM A PART OF THEIR OM WARM ENSERS ON THEIR FACE THARE IN THESE LITTLE PITS ON ON THE FACE CIRCUM BABY RATTLESNINKS SIRW THER THEY ADULT IT O I WASN'T HIN TO DIMINISH THE DANGER I HAVE FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE LITTLE ONES NO I IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU WORK ON RATTLESNINS WELL BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VERSION OF AN EXTRACEPTIVE CENSORY SYSTEM THAT IS THEYRE LOOKING OUT INTO THE WORLD USING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SET OF CENSERS THEY'RE USING THE SAME CENSORS THAT WOULD FEEL THE WARMTH ON YOUR FACE IF YOU STOOD IN FRONT OF A BONDFIRE EXCEPT EVOLUTION IS GIVEN THEM THIS VERY NICE SPECIALIZED SYSTEM THAT LET'S THEM IMAGE WEAR THE HEATS COMING FROM YOU CAN SORT O DO THAT ANYWAY RIGHT IF YOU WALK AROUND THE FIRE YOU CAN FEEL WHICH FER THE FIERIES FROM THE THE N OF THE HEAT HITTING YOUR FACE IS THAT IN JUSENARY WAY IN WHICH THEY DETECT PRAIS ONE OF ONE OF THE MAJOR WAYS AND IN FACT THES VISION IS WELL AND THEY BRING THESE TWO SYSTEMS TOGETHER IN THE SAME PLACE IN THIS TECTOM REGIONS BRAINSTEM THERAINS ON EACH ON JUTTING ABOUT WHEN THE TINKS THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT MAY BE OLD FACTORY THERE MADE THERE SNIFFING THE AIR WITH THERS ON AN THER MAY BE A AS WE AR DRIVE YOU TOLD ME THAT FLIES ACTUALLY TASTING WITH THEIR FEET VESSEL AVE THEY HAVE TASTE RCEPTRES AND LOTS OF FUNNY PLACES I BUT I WANT TA PAUSE HERE JUST FOR ONE SECOND BEFORE WE GET BACK INTO THE MID BRAIN I THINK WHAT'S SO INTERESTING IN ALL SERIOUSNESS ABOUT TASTE RECEPTORS ON FEET HEAT CENSORS TONGUES CHUTTING NOWT OF SNAKES AND VISION IN ALL THITS INTEGRATION IS THAT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT ALL THESE SENSORY NURONS ARE TRYING TO GATHER INFORMATION RAN STUFF IT INTO A SYSTEM THAT CAN MAKE MEANING FUL DECISIONS AND ACTIONS AND THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHETHE OR NOT IT'S COMING FROM EYES OR EARS OR KNOSE OR BOTTOMS OF FEET BECAUSE IN THE END IT'S JUST ELECTRICITY FLOWING IN AND SO IT'S IT IT SOUNDS LIKE GITS PLACED ON EACH ANIMAL SALWAYS FEELS WEARE TO CALL FLYING ANIMAL BUT THEY ARE ANTERS AT THEY ARE ANIMALS A IT'S PLACE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ON DIFFERENT ANIMALS DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THAT ANIMAL RIGHT BUT HOW MUCH MORE POWERFUL IF THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS CAN ALSO CROSS CUIRRELY A CROSS CENSORY SYSTEMS SO IF YOU'VE GOT A WEAK SIGNAL FROM ONE CENSRY SISTING OU'RE NOT QUITE SURE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE AND A WEEKS SIGNAL FROM A ANOTHER CENSR Y SISTEM TA'S TELL MIEG THE SAME LOCATIONS IS IS A LITTLE B INTERESTING THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE YOU'VE GOT THOSE TWO TOGETHER YOU'VE GOT CORROBORATION YOUR BRAIN NOW SAYS IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT THAT'SCNYOU DON'T BE SOMETHING WORTH PAYING ATTENTION TO RIS O MAYBE I AM FEELING SOME HEAT ON ONE SIDE OF MY FACE UM AND I ALSO SMELL SOMETHING BAKING IN THE OVEN RIGHT SO NOW THERE'S IT'S NEITHER IS PARTICULARLY STRONG BUT AS YOU SAID THERE SOME CORROBORATION RIGHT AND THAT CORROBORATION AS O CURRING IN THE MID BRAIN RIGHT AND THEN IF YOU THROW THINGS INTO CONFLICT NOW THE BRAIN IS CONFUSED AND THAT MAY BE WHERE YOU'RE YOURE MOTION SICKNESS COMES FROM SO IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU KNOW AS A AS A BRAIN I'S GREAT TO HAVE AS MANY SOURCES AND INFORMATION AS YOU CAN HAVE JUST LIKE IF YOU'RE A OU NOW YOUR YOURE A SPY OR A JOURNALIST YOU DON'T WANT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS CAN GET ABOUT WHAT'S OUT THERE BUT IF THINGS CONFLICT THAT'S PROBLEMATIC RIGHT YOUR SOURCES ARE GIVING YOU DIFFERINFORMATION BOUT WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON NOW YOUVE GOT A PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS WHAT YOU PUBLISH THE MID BRAIN IS SO FASTENING I I DON'T WANT IT EJECT US FROM THE MIDBRAIN AND GO BACK TO THE VESTIBULOUS SYSTEM BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION THAT I'VE FORGOT TO ASK ABOUT THE VESTIBULAR SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY IS IT THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING ME THERE'S DESPITE MY MOTIONS SICKNESS AND CAPS THAT THERE'S A SENSE OF PLEASURE IN MOVING THROUGH SPACE AND GETTING TILTED RELATIVE TO THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF THE EARTH FOR ME GROWING UP IT WE SCAPEBOARDING BUT PEOPLE LIKE TO CORNER IN CARS CORNER ON BIKES UM IT MAY BE FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S DONE RUNNING OR DANCE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT ABOUT MOVING THROUGH SPACE AND GETTING TILTED LAS SERFER S AROUND HERE GETTING TILTED THAT CAN TAP INTO SOME OF THE PLEASURE CENTER ISD WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHY THAT WOULD FLY AD NO CLUES THEIR JOBLEMEN ERGHI CAN PUT TO THE M SYSTEM WELL YOU KNOW THE DOPEMENERGIC SYSTEM GETS A LOT OF PLACES YOU KNOW I IT'S PRETTY MUCH TO SOME EXTENT EVERYWHERE IN THE QUARTECKS A LOTMORE IN THE FRONT A LOBE OF COURSE BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS I MEAN THERE'S BASICALLY DOPEMEN URGING INNERVATION MOST PLACES IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM SO THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR DOLEMEN URGING INVOLVEMENT BUT I REALLY HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT THE TILTING PHENOMENON I MEANING YOU DON'T PAY MONEY TO GO ON ROLLER COASTERS RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT MAY BE AS MUCH ABOUT THE THRILL IS ANY JURS AND FALLING AS THE FALLING REFLECTSES VERY ROBUST IN ALL OF US I  IN THE VISUAL WORLDS GOING UP VERY FAST THA INLEMEANS THAT WERE FALLING RIGHT BUT IAM SOME PEOPLE LIKE THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T RIGHT AND KIDS KIDS TOLERATE A LOT MORE YOU KNOW A SORT OF STIBUTOR CRAZING IS SPINNING AROUND UNTIL THEY TROP AND I NOT SE I'VE FRIENDS IT ALWAYS YOU KNOW WORGS ME LOA BIT THAT WILL THEY THROW THEIR KIDS I'M NOT RECOMMENDING  AND DO THIS WHEN THEY'RE LOW KIDS YOU KNOW LIKE THROWING THE KIDS REALLY FAR BACK AND FORTH AM CAN SOME CAN SEEM TO LOVE IT EYOUR S I'M LOVE BEING SHAKEN UP AND DOWN VERY VERY I VIGOROUSLY EHAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD COME DOWN SOMETIMES INTERESTING YES O I'M GUESSING WE CAN WE CAN NA GES THAT MAY BE THERE'S SOME ACTIVATION OF THE REWARD SYSTEMS FROM NOU BEING MOVED MOVING THROUGH SPACE WELL TOT ME IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOU HOW REWARDING IT IS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH SPACE AND HOW UNHAPPY PEOPLE ARE WHO WERE USED TO THAT WHO SUDDENLY AREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT THERE IS A A SENSE OF AGENCY READY IF YOU YOU CAN CHOOSE TO MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD AND TO TILT TOTS NOT ONLY MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD BUT YOU'RE DOING WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FINASS MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT AS YOU CEN FEEL LIKE YOUR THE MASTER OF YOUR OWN MOVEMENT OIN A WAY THAT YOU WOULDN'T IF YOU ARE GOING STRAIGHT I'M I'M JUST BOIN SMOKE HERE YKNOW O WE CAN SPECULATE THAT'S FINE I I CAN'T HELP BUT ASK THE QUESTION WE CASE IF WE UM I MOVE OURSELVES I'MPUN INTENDED BACK INTO THE MIDBRAIN THE MID BRAINS COMBINING ALL TESE DIFFERENT SIGNALS FOR REFLECTSIVE ACTION AT WHAT POINT DOES THIS BECOME DELIBERATE ACTION BECAUSE IF I LOOK AT SOMETHING I WANT IN I WNE PURSUEIT IAM GOING TO GO TOWARD IT AND MANY TIMES THAT'S A DELIBERATE DECISION RIGHT SO THIS GETS VERY SLIPPERY I THINK BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE TO TRY TO IMAGINE IS ALL THESE DIFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN WORKING ON THE PROBLEM OF STAYING ALIVE AYOU KNOW IN SURVIVING AND IN IN THE WORLD A THER'RE WORKING ON THE PROBE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THERE'S NOT ONE RIGHT ANDSWER TOA HOW TO DO THAT O BUT THE ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THER ARE VERY WELL DESIGNED TO OVERRIDE AND OTHER WISE AUTOMATIC MOVEMENT IF ITS N APPROPRIATE SO IF YU IMAGINE YOU'VE BEEN INVITED TO TEA WITH THE QUEEN AN SHE HANDS YOU AH YOUR VERY FANCY WEDGE WOULD YOU TEACOP VERY THIN WEDGE WOULD TEA  YES WITH VERY HOT TEA IN IT YOU'RE BURNING YOUR HAND YOU PROBABLY WILF TRY TO FIND A WAY TO PUT THAT BAK DOWN ON THE SAWCER RATHER THAN IS DROPPING ON ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE YOU'RE WITH THE QUEEN YOU U KNOW YOU'R TRYING TO BE APPROPRIATE TO THAT SO YOU HAVE WAYS OF RAINING IN AUTOMATIC BEHAVIOURS IF THEY'REGONGTO BE MALEDAPTIV BUT YOU ALSO WANT THE REFLEX TO WORK QUICKLY IF IT'S THE ONLY THING IS CAN TO SAVE YOU THE LOOMING YOU KNO OBJECT COMING AT YOUR HEAD YOUN'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT SO THIS IS THE INTERPLAY IN THESE HIERARCHICALLY ORGANIZED CENTERS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AT THE LOWEST LEVEL YOU'VE GOT THE AUTOMATIC CENSERS THAT IN CENTRES AND REFLEX YOU A ARKS THAT WILL KEEP YOU SAFE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT AND THAT YOU'VE GOT THE HIER CENTRE SAYING WELL MA BYEU COUL DO THIS AS WELL OR MAY YOU WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT AT ALL RIGHT SO YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT LEVELS OPERATING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND YOU NEED BY DIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HIGH LEVEL COGNATIVE CENTERS DECISION MAKING ON THE ONE HAND AND THESE LOW LOVE A VERY HEALPHFUL REFLEX OF CENTERS BUT THEY'RE LITTLE RIGID LITTLE HARD WIERED SO THEY NEED SOME NEW ANE SO THIS THEY'RE BOTH OF THESE THINGS ARE OPERATING INTANIM IN REAL TIME ALL THE TIME ON OUR BRAINS AND SOMETIMES YO LISTEN MORE TO ONE THAN THE OTHER YOU'VE FOR PEOPLE IN SPORTS TALKING ABOUT MESSING UP AT THE PLAYCAUSE THEY OVERTHOUGHT IT YOURE THINKING TOO HARD ABOUT IT THAT'S PARTLY YOUVE VOERY TRAINED YOUR SIR SARABELL THAT IT A FASTBALL RIGHT ON THE MIDDLE RIGHT AND IF YOU START LOOKING FOR FOR SOMETHING NOU ORE DIFFERENT  YOU'RE GOING TO MESS UP YOUR YOUR REFLEX IVE SWING RIGHT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THE PHYSICS OF THE BALL AS IS COMING AT YOU YOU'VE ARTY MISS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU R YOU'RE NOT USING YOUR THIS ALL THOSE REPTS HAVE BUILT A KIND OF KNOWLEDGE IS WHAT YOU WANT TA RELY ON WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO A CONTEMPLATE THIS IS IMPORTANT AND A GREAT SEGUAY FOR WHAT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS NEXT WIT IT WHICH IS THE BAZIL GANGUIA THIS REELLY INTERESTING IN THE ERRY OF THE BRAIN THAT'S INVOLVED IN GO TYPE COMMANDS AND BEHAVIOURS INSTRUCTING US TO DO THINGS AND NO GO PREVENTING US FROM DOING THINGS WIT SO MUCH OF MOTOR LEARNING AND SKILL EXECUTION AND I'M NOT SAYING THE WRONG THING ORE SITTING STILL IN CLASS WHEN OR AS YOU USED WITH THAT YOU KNOW TEA WITH THE QUEEN EXAMPLE FEELING DISCOMFORT INVOLVES SUPPRESSING BEHAVIOUR AND SOMETIMES IT'S ACTIVATING BEHAVIOUR Y O TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ON LINE ATTENTION AS DEVOTED TO I'M TRYING TO GET PEOPLE MOTIVATED IF THIS ISN'T THE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR POTGUESS WE TOUCH ON SOME OF THE UNDERLINE NIRL CIRCUITS OF OF MOTIFATION DOPEN ME AND SO FORTH BUT SO MUCH OF WHAT PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH OUT THERE OR ELEMENTS AROUND FAILURE TO PAY ATTENTION OR O CHALLENGES IN PAYING ATTENTION WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY PUTTING THE BLINDERS ON NAIR YOU GETTING A SO TO STRAW F YOW OF THE WORLD AND MAINTAINING THAT FOR A BOUT OF WORK OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND TRYING TO GET INTO ACTION SO OF COURSE THIS IS CARRIED OUT BY MANY NARRL CIRCUITS NOT JUST THE BASIL GANGLEA BUT WHAT ARE THE BAZIL GANGLEA AND WHAT ARE THEIR PRIMARY ROLES IN  CONTROLLING GO TIGHT BEHAVIOR AND NO GO TIGHT BEHAVIOR YES SO I ME TO ET THE BASIL GANGLE ARE SITTING DEEP IN WHAT YOU'D CALL THE FOUR BRAINS OR THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE BRAIN THEY ARE SORT OF COUSINS TO THE CREBRAL CARTEX WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT IS SER THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF YOUR BRAIN THE THE THING YOU'RE THINKING WITH THREBLECORTE BEEN THE REFINED COUSINS AND THEN YOU'VE GET THE RAY YOU KNOW THE BRUTES YAA I MAY THAT'S PROBABLY TOTALLY UNFAIR BUT TET AT SIRI LIKE THE BASIL GANGLEY I CAN RELATE UNDPARTS OF THE BRAIN THOUGH BUT TO HI PATHOL MASLOW IS A BASIL GANGLEA SURE WE NEED IT ALL WE NEED IT ALL AND I YOU KNOW THIS AIREY OF THE BRAIN HAS GOTTEN A LOT BIGGER AS THE CARTEX HAS GOTEN BIGGER AND IT'S DEEPLY INTERTWINED WITH CARTICAL FUNCTION THE CORTEX CAN'T REALLY DO WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO WITHOUT THE HELP THE BASIL GANGLEY AND VICE VERSA SO THEYRE REALLY INTERTWINED A AND IN A WAY YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THIS LOGICALLY IS SAYING YOU KNOW IF IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO WITH WHOLD BEHAVIOR OR TO EXECUTE IT HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH TO DO WELL TE CORTEXAS CAN HAVE TO DO THAT THINKING FOR YOU YOU HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT ALL THE CONTINGENCIES OF YOUR SITUATION O DECIDE IS THIS TA CRAZY MOVE OR IS THIS REALLY SMART INVESTMENT RIGHT NOW OR EN OF WHAT I DON'T WANT TO GO OFT FOR RUN IN THE MORNING I'M GOING TO MAKE MYSELF GO OUT FOR RUN OR I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME OUT ON A RUN AND I KNOW I NEED TO GET BACK BUTKIND ONE TO GO ANOTHER MILE IM MEAN ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE IS THAT YOU ARE THE MARSHMELL O TEST FOR THE LITTLE KIDS YOU KNOW THEY CAN GET TWO MARSHMELL AS IF THEY HOLD OFF YOU KNOW JUST THIRTY SECONDS INITIALLY YOU KNOW TEY CAN HAVE ONE RIGHT AWAY BUT IF THEY CAN WAIT THERY SECONDS THEY GOT TO YOU NOW SO THAT'S THE NO GO BECAUSE THEIR CORTEX IS SAYING YUKNW I REALLY LIKE TO HAVE TWO MORE THAEM HAVING ONE BUT THEY'RE NOT CON TO GET THE TO UNLESS THEY CAN NOT MEACH FOR THE ONE SO THEY'VE GOT A HOLD OFF THE ACTION AH AND THAT HAS TO RESULT FROM A CODNE TO PROCESS OF THE CARTEX IS INVOLVED IN THIS IN A MAJOR WAY AH YES I RECALL N THAT EXPERIMENT THE KIDS USED O VARIETY OF TOOLS TO SOME ONE DISTRACT THEMSELVES I PARTICULARLY RELATED TO THE KID THAT WOULD JUST PUT HIMSELF RIGHT NEXT TO THE MARSHMELLS AND THEN WOULD AND THEN SOME THE KIDS COVER THEIR EYES SOME OF THEM WOULD COUNT OR SAYING YES THAT'S ALL VERY CORTICAL RY COMING UP WITH A NOVEL STRATITY SIMPLE EXAMPLE THAT WERE USING HERE BUT OF COURSE THIS IS AT PLAY ANY TIME SOME ONE DECIDES THEY WANTING TO WATCH A MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH OR SOMETHING JUST YOU KNOW A STEEVE JOB'S COMMENCEMENT SPEECH JUST TO GET MOTIV ATEO TO ENGAGE IN THEIR DE I TAKE THIS NEW JOB IT HAS GOT GREAT BENEFITS BUT IT'S AN ALOUSY PART OF THE COUNTRY WHY DO YOU THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HARDER TIME RUNNING THESE GO NO GO CIRCUITS AND OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE VERY IM LOW ACTIVATION ENERGY WE WOULD SAY THEY CAN JUST I YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A TASK THEY JUST LEAN INTO THE TASK HAS SOME PEOPLE GETTING INTO TASK COMPLETION OR THAT THINGS THAT SORT IS IS VERY CHALLENGING FOR THEM YE I MA I THINK IT'S REALLY JUST ANOTHER IS A SPECIAL CASE OF A VERY GENERAL PHENOMENO WHICH IS BRAINS ARE COMPLICATED AND BRAINS RESIN RAINS WE HAVE ARE THE RESULT OF GENETICS AND EXPERIENCE AND MY GEANES ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR GENES AND MY EXPERIENCES ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES SO THE THINGS THAT TO BE EASY OR HARD FOR US WON'T NECESSARILY BE A LINE THEY TEY MIGH JUST HAPPEN TO BE JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE BUT THE POINT IS THAT OU KNOW YOU YOUR DEALT A CERTAIN SET OF CARDS YOU HAVE CERTAINSET OF GENES YOU AR HANDED TO O KNOW A BRAIN YOU DON'T CHOOSE YOUR BRAIN IS HANDED TO YOU BUT THEN THERE'S ALL THE STUCK YOU CAN DO WITH IT YOUU KNOW YOU YOU CAN LEARN AM TO NOW TO TO HAVE NEW SKILLS OR TO YOU ACT DIFENTLY OR JUST SHOW MORE RESTRAINT WHICH IS KIND OF RELEVANT TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE OR MAY BE SHOW LESS RESTRAIN IF YOUR PROBLEM IS YOU'RE SO BUTTON NOW N YOU NEVER HAVE ANY FUN IN LIFE AND YOU SHOULD LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAS I ADAVID'S ALWAYS ENCOURAGE ME TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE FUN ASO BAZL GANGLEY ARE THEIR KIND OF THE DISCIPLINARY AND OR THAT THER'S THE SORT OF THE INSTRUCT OR CONDUCTOR OF SORTS RIGT GO NO GO YOU KNOW YOU BE QUIET YOU START NOW I WISH I KNEW MORE ABOUT THE BASIL GANGLEY THAN I THEN I DO MY SENSE IS THAT IT YOU KNOW THIS SYSTEM IS KEY FOR INPLEMENTING THE PLANS THAT YET COOKED UP IN THE QUARTECS AH BUT THEY ALSO INFLUENCE THE PLANS THAT THE YOU KNOW QUARTEXIS IS DISHING OUT BECAUSE THIS IS A MAJOUR SOURCE OF INFORMATION TOO THE QUARTEC SO IT BECOMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE COMPUTATION BEGINS AND WHERE IT ENDS AND WHOSE DOING WHAT BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE ALL INTERACTING IN A COMPLEX NET WORK AND IT'S ALL OF IT IT'S THE WHOLE NETWORK IT'S NOT YOU KNOW ONE IS THE LEADER IN THE OTHERS THE FOLLOWER OF COURSE THE OTHESE ARE ALL THE STRUCTURES THAT WERE DISCUSSING OUR WORKING IN PARALLEL RIGHT AND I THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGEING CROSSTOLK I HAVE THIS UM SOMEWHAT SICK A HABIT DAVID OF A EVERY DAY I TRY AND DO TWENTY ONE NOW GOES SO IF I WANT A REACH FOR MY PHONE I TRY IN NOT DO IT JUST TO SEE IF I CAN PREVENT MYSELF FROM ENGAGING IN THAT BEHAVIOUR IF IT WAS REFLECIVE IT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO DO A DELIBERATE CHOICE THAN I CERTAINLY ALLOW MYSELF TO DO IT RT I DON'T TEND AT TOO MUCH TROUBLE WITH MOTIVASION WITH GO TYPE FUNCTIONS MOST BECAUSE I'M SO BUSY THAT I I WISH I'D MORE TIME FOR MORE GOES BUT I'M SO TO SPEAK BUT DO YOU THINK THESE CIRCUITS HAVE GENUINE PLASTICITY AND H ABSOLUTELY I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW THEY'VE LEARNED OVER TIME TO WAIT FOR THE TOMARSHMELLL IS RIGHT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE INSTANT GRATIFICATION ALL THE TIME YOU'RE YOU'RE WILLING TO DO A JOB SOMETIMES IT ISN'T YOUR FAVOURITE JOB BECAUSE IT COMES WITH THE TERRITORY YOU WANT THE SALARY THAT COMES AT THE END OF THE WEEK AT THE END OF THE MONTH RIGHT SO WE CAN DEFER GRATIFICATION YOU KNW WE CAN CHOOSE NOT TO SAY THE THING THAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO INFLAME OUR PARTNER AN CREATA YOU KOW I MELT DOWN FOR THE NEXT WEEK YOU KNOW WE WE LEARN THIS CONTROL BUT I THINK THESE ARE SKILLS LIKE ANY OTHER AM YOU CAN GET BETTER AT IM IF YOU PRACTISE SO I THINK YOU'R YOU'RE CHOOSING TO DO THAT TO SPONTANEOUSLY IS AS KIND OF A OU KNOWS A MENTAL PRACTICE IT'S A DISCIPLINE IS A WAY OF BUILLING THE SKILLED THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE I FIND IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT WHEN I ENGAGE IN A NO GOTYPE A SITUATION A THEND THE NEXT TIME AND THE NEXT TIME THAT I FIND MYSELF ABOUT TO MOVE REFLEXIVELY THERE'S A LITTLE GAP IN CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I CAN INTER I CAN MAKE A DECISION WHETHER NOT THIS IS REALLY THE BEST USE OF MY TIME BECAUSE I I I SOMETIMES WONDER WHETHER NOT ALL THIS BUSINESS AROUND ATTENTION CERTAINLY THERE'S THE CASE OF EIGHTY H T AND CLINICAL DIAGNOST ADIAGE SHE BUT ALL THES AT THE ISSUE ROUND FOCUS AND ATTENTION IS REALLY THAT PEOPLE JUST HAVE NOT REALLY LEARNED HOW TO SHORT CIRCUIT A REFLEX AND SO MUCH OF WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT THAN RATTLE SNAKES OR WELL ISHALLY THEY COULD BE DELIBERATE BUT FROM THE OTHER ANIMALS AND IS OUR ABILITY TO SUPPRESS REFLEX WELL THAT'S THE QUARTEX AN  OR LET'S O SAY THE FORBRAT QUARTEX AN BAYSLLL GANGLEY RE WORKING TOGETHER SITTING ON TOP OF THIS LIZARD BRAIN THAT'S GIVING YOU ALL THESE GREAT ADAPT TOF REFLEX IS THAT HELP YOU SURVIVE YO JUST HOPE YOU DON'T GET THE SURPRISING CASE WHERE THE THING THAT YOUR REFLEX IS TELLING YOU IS ACTUALLY EXACTLY THE WRONG THING IN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE RIGHT AND THAT'S RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT THE QUARTEES FOR IT'S ADDING NEUADS AND CONTEXT AND EXPERIENCE PAST ASSOCIATION AND YIN HUMAN BEINGS OBVIOUSLY LEARNING FROM OTHERS THROUGH YOU KNOW COMMUNICATION WELL I WAS YOU I WENT RIGHT TO IT I'M AND IT WAS WHERE I WAS GOING TO GO SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE QUARTEX WE'VE WORKED OUR WAY UP THE SO CALE NER AXES AS ON THE APHYSIONONOS WILL LL KNOW SO WE'RE IN THE QUARTEX THIS IS THE SEAT OF OUR HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS SELF IMAGE PLANNING AN ACTION BUT AS YOU MENTION THE QARTEXIS IN JUST ABOUT THAT IT'S GOT OTHER REGIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN OTHER THINGS SO MAYBE WE SHOULD AS TO STAYING WITH VISION S TALKLE O BIT ABOUT VISUAL QUARTEX YOU TOLD ME A STORY AN AMAZING STORY ABOUT VISUAL QUARTEX AND IT WAS THE SOMEWHAT OF A SAD STORY UNFORTUNATELY ABOUT SOME ONE WHO HAD A STROKE TO VISUAL QUARTEX MAYBE YOU YOU WOULD A SHARE THAT STORY BECAUSE I THINK IT ILLUSTRATES A MANY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES ABOUT WHAT THE QUARTEK DOES RIGHT SO I YOU DON'T THE VISUAL QUARTEX IS YOU COULD SEY THE PROJECTION SCREEN THE FIRST OUNON PLACE WORD THIS INFORMATION STREAMING FROM THE RETINA THROUGH THIS ALAMOUS YOU CONNECTING LINKER YET'S PLAYED OUT FOR THE THE HIGHEST LOVEL OF YOUR BRAIN TO SEE AM IT'S A REPRESENTATION IT'S A MAP OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE VISUAL WORLD THAT'S IN YOUR BRAIN AH AND I WHEN WE DESCRIBE A SCENE TO A FRIEND WERE USING THIS CRUNK OF OUR BRAIN TO BE ABLE TO PUT WORDS WHICH ARE COMING FROM A DIFFERENT PART OF OUR QUARTEK TO THE OBJECTS AND AND MOVEMENTS AND COLORS THAT WE SEE IN THE WORLD AM SO YOU KNOW THAT'S I KEEP PART OF YOUR VISUAL EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CAN DESCRIBE THE THINGS YOURE SEEING YOU YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR VISUAL QUARTEK AND THIS IS THAT I JUST SAS A GOOD QUESTION SO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT YOUR FACE RIGHT AS WE'RE TALKING THERE ARE NURONS IN MY BRAIN MORE OR LESS IN THE CONFIGURATION OF YOUR FACE THAT ARE ACTIVE AS YOU MOVE ABOUT AND AH WHAT IF I WERE TO CLOSE MY EYES AND JUST IMAGINE  I DO THIS ALL THE TIME BY THE WAY DAVID OAS MAD AND I IMAGINE DAVID BURSON'S FACE I DON'T TEND TO DO THAT AS IF MAYBE I SHOULD BUT YOU GET THE POINT I I'M NOW YOUS VISUALIZATION A WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE BY WAY OF MEMORY IF WE WERE TO IMAGE THE NURANS IN MY BRAIN WOULD THE ACTIVITY OF NURAN'S RESEMBLE THE ACTIVITY OF NURANS THAT'S PRESENT WHEN I OPEN MY EYES AND LOOK AT YOUR ACTUAL THIS IS A DEEP QUESTION WE DON'T REALLY HAVE FULL  I NOW ESTELEN TO NTAT YES EXCEPT YOU KNOW YOURE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING IN DETAIL AT THE ACTIVITY OF NURANS IN A HUMAN BRAIN AND THAT'S NOTS AS EASY TO DO AS AS IT WOULD BE IN A ENUON SOME KIND OF ANIMAL MODEL BUT YOU ARE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU YOU HAVE A SPACIAL REPRESENTATION OF THE VISUAL WORLD LAT AT TE MAP OF THE VISUAL WORLD LAI OWN ON ANOTHER SURFACE OF YOUR UARTEK THE THING THATS SURPRISING IS THT IT'S NOT ONE MAP IT'S ACTUALLY DOZENS OF MAPS WHATO EACH OF THOSE MAPS DO WELL WE DON'T REALLY HAV AFULE ACCOUNTING THERE EITHER BUT IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE OUTPUT NURANS OF THE RATEN O THE GANGLY AN SELLS WE WARE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THER ARE IFFERENT TYPES OF GAINLANDSELVES THAT ARE INCODING DIFFERENT KINDS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE VISUAL WORLD WE TALK ABOUT THE ONES THAT WERE CONCUUDING THE BRIGHTNESS BUT ITHE ONCE ARE INCODING MOTION OR COLOR THESE KINDS OF THINGS THE SAME KINDS OF SPECIALIZATIONS IN DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIONS OF THE VISUAL WORLD IN THE QUARTEK AH SEEM TO BE TRUE IT'S A COMPLEX STORY WE DON'T HAVE THE WHOLD THE WHOLE PICTURE YET BUT IT DOES LOOK AS IF SOME PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR THINGS LIKE REACHING FOR THINGS IN THE SPACE AROUND YOU AND OTHER PARTS OF THE CARTECTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR MAKING ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PARTICULAR VISUAL THINGS YOURE LOOKING AT NOW AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE WHAT THEY WHAT WHAT IS THAT OBJECT WHAT CAN IT DO FOR ME HOW CAN I USE IT WHAT ABOUT THE REALLY SPECIALIZED AREAS OF CORTEX LIKE THE VERY LIKE NURONS THAT RESPOND O PARTICULAR FACES OR AM NURANS THAT I DON'T NOW CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHERE I AM RELATIVE TO SOME OTHER SPECIFIC OBJECT RIGHT SO YOU A VISITTHESER ARE PROPERTES OF NURONS THAT  EXTRACTED FROM DETECTED BY RECORDING THE ACTITIVITY OF SINGLE NURONS IN SOME EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN YOU ACTUALLY PERCEIVE YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S FACE IS A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED QUESTION CLEARLY INVOLVES HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS AND PUBLIC MILLIONS OF NURONS ACTING IN A COOPERATIVE WAY SO YOU CAN PICK OUT ANY ONE LITTLE ELEMENT IN THIS VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM AND SEE THAT IT'S RESPONDING DIFFERENTIALLY TO CERTAIN KINDS OF USUAL PATTERNS AND YOU THINK YOUR SEEING A GLIMPSE OF SOME PART OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S FACE BUT THAT'S A LONG WAY FROM A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO BE AT THE LEVEL OF A MAGIC SINGLE NURON THAT HAS THE SPECIAL STUFF TO RECOGNIZE YOUR GRANDMOTHER AS GOING TO BE IN SOME PATTERN OF ACTIVITY ACROSS MANY MANY SELLS RESINATING IN SOME KIND OF SPECIAL WAY THAT WILL REPRESENT THE INTERNAL YOU KNOW MEMORY OF YOUR OF YOUR MOTHER SO IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE YAHIMIN HAVIN THAT EVERY TIME WE DO THIS DEEP DIVE WHICH WE DO FROM TIME TO TIME YOU AND IE WE CAN LET MARCH INTO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND AM EXPLORE HOW DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF ARE OF OUR LIFE EXPERIENCES IS HANDLED THERE AND HOW IT'S ORGANIZED THE IT AFTER SO MANY DECATES OF DOING THIS IT IT STILL BOGGLES MY MIND THAT THAT THE COLLECTION OF NURONS A ONE THROUGH SEVEN AM ACTIVE IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE GIVES THE MEMORY OF A A PARTICULAR FACE AND AM RUN BACKWARDS SEVEN THROUH TO ONE IT GIVES YOU A COMPEYOU COULD BE YOU KNOW WHAT RATTLESNAKE PTIPER A HEAT SENSING ORANS RAGER TI COM OUT EARLIER AM SO IT SOUNDS IS IT TRUE THAT THEREIS A LOT OF MULTI PURPOSE IN OF THE CIRCUITRY LIKE WE CAN'T SAY ONE BERI OF THE BRAIN DOES AY AND ANOTHER AIREAR THE BRAIN DOES BES UP YON AREAS CAN MULTI TASK ER HAMULTIBLE JOBS THAT CAN MOONLIGHT RIGHT BUT GHT I I THINK IN MY CAREER THE HARD PROBLEM HAS BEEN TO SQUERE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT OU KNO THINGS ARE SPECIALIZED THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC GENES EXPRESSED IN SPECIFIC NURONS THAT MAKE THEM ME SYNAPTOC CONNECTIONS WITH ONLY CERTAIN OTHER NURON S AND THAT PARTICULAR SNAPTIC ARRANGEMENT ACTUALLY RESULTS IN THE FROSESSING OF INFORMATION THAT'S USEFUL TO THE ANIMAL TO SURVIVE RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S EITHER A BIG UNDIFERENTIATED NETWORK OF SAULS AND LOOKING THT ANY ONE IS NEVERING TO TELL YOU ANYTHING THAT'S TOO EXTREME ON THE ONE HAND NOR IS IT THE CASE THAT EVERYTHIGIS HARD WIRED AN EVERY NONE HAS ONE FUNCTION AND THIS ALL HAPPENS IN ONE PLACE IN THE BRAIN IT'S WAY WORE COMPLICATED IN INTURACTIVE AND INTERCONNECTED THAN THAT SO THET WE'RE NOT HARD WIRED OR SOFT WIRE BOTH WERE SORT OF AM I KNOW WHAT THE ANALOGIES SHOULD BE WHAT WHAT SUBSTANCE WOULD WORK BEST AN NO IDEA THEARE BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE IDEA IS THAT IT'S ALWAYS NETWORK ACTIVITY THIS ALWAYS MANY MANY NURONS INVOLVED AND YET THERE'S TREMENDOUS SPECIPICITY IN THE NORNES THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN ANY DISTRIBUTED O FUNCTION LIKE THAT RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR MIND AROUND THE FACT THAT IT'S BOTH VERY SPECIFIC AND VERY NONSPECIFIC AT THE SAME TIME SITTLE TRICKY TO DO BUT I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THE TRUTH LAWS AND SO THE THIS EXAMPLE THAT YOU MENTIOND ONT TO ME ONCE BEFORE ABOUT A WOMAN WHO HAD A STROKE IN VISUAL QUARTEX AND I SPEAKS TO SOME OF THIS RIGHT AM TOULD HE SHARE WITH US THAT STORY SURE SO THE THE POINT IS THAT YOU YOU ALL THOSE OF US WHO WO SEE HAVE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE VISUAL WORLD IN OUR VISUAL QUARTEX WHAT HAPPENS TO SOMEBODY WHEN THEY BECOME BLIND BECAUSE OF PROMISIN THE EYE THE RETTEN OF PERHAPS AH YOU HAVE A BIG TRUNK OF THE QUARTEX IS REALLY VALUABLE REAL ESTATE FOR NORL PROCESSING AM THAT IS COME TO EXPECT INPUT FROM THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND THERE ISN'T ANY ANY MORE SO YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT THAT IS FALLOW LAND RIGHT IS JUST IT'S UNUNAM USED BY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM N THAT WOULD BE A PITY BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT IS IN FACT USED AM AND THE THE CASE THAT YOU'R TALKING ABOUT IS OF A WOMAN WHO WAS AM BLIND FROM VERY EARLY ITA IN HER LIFE AND WHO HAD RISEN THROUGH THE RANKS TO A VERY HIGH LEVEL EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAL POSITION IN A MAJOR CORPORATION I AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY GOOD AT RAIL READING AND SHE HAD A RAIL TYPEWRITER AND THAT'S HOW EVERYTHING WAS DONE AND APPARENTLY SHE HAD A STROKE AND WAS DISCOVERED IT WERE COLLAPSED IN PART OF THE HOSPITAL AND AM APPARENTLY THE NEUROLOGIST WHO SAW HER WHEN SHE FINALLY CAME TOO SAID YOU HAVE GOT GOOD NEWS IN BAD NEWS BAD NEWS IS HEE HAD A STROKE THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT WAS IN AN AIRE OF YOUR RAIN OR NOT EVEN USING ITS YOUR VISUAL QARTEX AND I KNOW YOUR BLIND FROM BIRTHS O THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY ISSUE HERE THE PROBLEM WAS SHE LOST HER ABILITY TO READ BRAIL SO WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE AND THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IN OTHER WAYS BY IMAGING EXPERIMENTS IN HUMANS IS THAT IN PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND FROM VERY EARLY IN BIRTH THE VISUAL CARTEX GET'S REPURPOSE AS AN A CENTRE FOR PROCESSING TACTILE INFORMASIONE AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU DRAIN TO BE A GOOD BRAIL READER YOU'RE ACTUALLY REALLOCATING SOMEHOW THAT REAL ESTATE TO YOUR FINGER TEPS YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF THE CORTEX THAT SHOULD BE LISTENING TO THE EYES SO THAT'S AN EXTREME LEVEL OF PLASTISTY BUT WHAT IT SHOWS IS THE VISUAL CARTEX IS KIND OF A GENERAL PURPOSE PROCESSING MACHINE IS GOOD AT SPASIUL INFORMATION AND THE SKIN OF YOUR FINGERS IS JUST ANOTHER SPACIAL SENSE AND DEPRIVED OF Y ANY OTHER INPUT THE BRAINS SEEMS SMART ENOUGH IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY TO REWIRE ITSELF TO USE THAT REAL ESTATE FOR SOMETHING A USEFUL IN THIS CASE READING BRAIL INCREDIBLE SOMEWHAT TRAGIC BUT I HADABLE LEAVE YOURE NAT CANTRAGIC I VERY FOR VERY IN FORMATIVE AND OF COURSE IT CAN GO THE OTHER WAY TOO I WERE PEOPLE CAN GAIN FUNCTION YIN PARTICULAR MODALITIES I CAN PROVE HERING ER TACTILE FUNCTION IN THE ABSENCE OF VISSION RITEM TELL US ABOUT CONNECTOMES WE HEAR ABOUT GENOMS PRODEOMS MICRO BYOMS OLMSOLMS OMS AH THESE DAYS AM WHAT'S A CONNECTOM AND THEIS IS VALUABLE YES SO SO CONNECTOMACTUALLY NOW HAS TWO MEANINGS SO I'VE ONLY REFER TO WHAT THE ONE THAT IS MY PASSION RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF NERVOUS TISSUE AT A SCALE A THAT'S VERY VERY FINE M SI MALLER THAN A MILLIMETER WAY SMALLER THAN A MLLIMETER A NANO MEATER OR LESS AS US A THOUSAND TIMES SMALLER AM OR OR ITSETUALLY YOU KNOW AAAA A MILLION TIMES SMALLER AH SO REALLY REALY TINY YET ON THE SCALE OF INDIVIDUAL SYNAPSES BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL NURONS OR EVEN SMALLER LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL SYNAPTIC VESICLES CONTAINING LITTLE PACKETS OF NERVE TRANSMITTERY TEN TO GET A RELEASED TO A WONDER ON TO COMMUNICATE TO THE NEXT SO VERY VERY FINE AM BUT THE THE NOTION HERE IS THAT YOUR DOING THIS SECTION AFTER SECTION A VERY FINE SCALE SO IN THEORY WHAT YOU HAVE IS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF A CHUNK OF NERVOUS TISSUE THAT IS SO COMPLETE THAT IF YOU TOOK ENOUGH TIME TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE BOUNDARIES ARE ALL THE SELLS ARE YOU COULD COME UP WITH A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE SYNAPTIC WIRING OF THAT CHUNK OF NERVOUS TISSUE BECAUE YOU HAVE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION F WHERE ALL THE SELLS ARE AND WHERE ALL THE SYNAPS IS BEFORE ALL THE SELLS ARE SO NOW YOU ESSENTUALLY HAVE A WIRING DIREGRAM OF THIS COMPLICATED PIECE OF TISSUE SO THE OMIX PART IS THE EXHAUSTIVENESS OF IT RATHER THAN LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF SYNAPSES THAT ARE INTERESTING TO YOU FROM TO DIFFERENT SELTIPES YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE SYNAPSES OF ALL F THE SELTIVES AH WHICH OF COURSE IS S MASSIVE I HAVE A LAGE OF DATA I SA INGENATICS YOU HAVE GENETICS AND THE O GENOMICS WITAY IDEA OF GETTING THE HOLE GENA HALL OF IT AND WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN AN ALEGOUS WORD FOR GENATICS BUT IT WOULD BE CONNECTIVITY AND CONOMAC IIIS AVONCONICTOMA HONY TOMICS OM CERTIVY AND CONICTOMAC SO ITS ITS ITS WANNING AT ALL AND OF COURSE IT'S CRAZY AMBITIOUS BUT YOURE THUT'S THUS WHERE IT GETS FOND YOU US IT REALLY IT'S T A USE OF ELECTRON MY CROSSCOPY A VERY HIGH RESOLUTION MICROSCOPIC IMAGING SYSTEM ON A NEW SCALE WITH WAY MORE PAY OFF IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE CONCTIVITY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IT'S JUST EMERGING BUT I REALLY THINK ITS CONNER REVOLUTIONIZED THE FIELD BECAUSE WE'RE GOTG TO BE ABLE TO QUERY THESE CIRCUITS HOW D THEY ACTUALLY DO IT LOOK AT THE HARDWARE IN A WAY THAT'S NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE BEFORE THE WAY TO I DESCRIBE THIS TO PEOPLE AS AM IF YOU ARE TO TAKE A CHUNK OF UM AND COLD COOKED BUT COLD SPIGETY RIGHT AND SLICE IT UP VERY THIN YOUR SHIN TO CONNECT UP EACH IMAGE OF EACH SLICE OF THE EDGE OF THE SPIGETTY AS FIGUE OUT WHICH ROPES OF SPIGETY BELONG TO WHICH AND HAVE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF WORD THIS PIECES SBEGETTY TOUCH AS THAT PIECES SPEGETTING AS THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL THER O AS THE NEAD SAUC IS AND ALL THE OTHER SELTIPES AN THE RANITS THE THE PESTO N ALL WEAR IT ALL IS AROUND THE SPIGETY GOT AS OF THE OTHER SELT THE BLOOD VESSELS AND THE GLEAL CELLS AND SO WHAT'S IT GOOD FOR I MEAN IT YOU MAPS ARE GREAT ROUN I WAS THINK OF CONNECTOMCS AND GENOMICS AND PRODIOMICS CETERA AS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT I RIGHT SO I MEAN I IN MANY CASES WHAT YOU DO AS YOU GO OUT AND PROBELY THE THE FUNCTION AND YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN DOES THE FUNCTION BY FINDING NURONS IT SEEM TO BE FIRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH WITH THI FUNCTION THAT YOU'RE OBSERVING AND LITTLE BY LITTLE YOUR WORK YOUR WAY IN AND NOW YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE CONACTIVITY IS MAYBE THE ANATOMY COULD HELP YOU BUT THIS CONNECT HOMICS APPROACH OR AT LEAST THE SERIAL ELECTORN MY CROSSCO BE RECONSTRUCTION OF NURONS APPROACH REALLY IS ALLOWING US TO FRAME QUESTIONS STARTING FROM THE ANATOMY AND SAYING I SEE A SCYNAPTIC CIRCUIT HERE MY PREDICTION WOULD BE THAT THESE SELTIPES WOULD INTERACT IN A PARTICULAR WAY IS THAT RIGHT AND THEN YOU CAN GO AND PROBE THE PHYSIOLOGY AND YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT OR YOU MIGHT BE WRONG BUT MORE OFTEN THAN OT IT LOOKS LIKE THE STRUCTURE IS POINTING US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO IN MY CASE I 'M USING THIS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND A CIRCUIT TIT IS INVOLVED IN THIS IMAGE IMAGE STABLIZATION THAT WER WERE TALKING ABOUT  KEEPING THINGS STABLE ON THE RETNA AND THIS THINGIL ONLY RESPOND AT CERTAIN SPEEDS OF MOTION ESE THESE CELLS IN THE CIRCUIT LIKE SLOW MOTION TEY WON'T RESPOND TO FAST MOTION HOW DOES THAT COME ABOUT WELL I WAS ABLE TO PROBE THE CIRCUITRY I KNEW WHAT MY SELLS LOOKED LIKE I COULD SEE WHICH OTHER SOULS WERE TALKING TO IT I COULD CATEGORIZEA LISTLES THAT MIGHT ME THE PLAYERS HERE THERE INVOLVED IN THIS MECHANISM OF TUNING THING FOR SLOW SPEEDS AND THEN WE SAY TOT LOOKS LIKE ITS THAT SELLTYPE AND WE WENT AND LOOKED AND THE DATIF BORE THAT UP BUT THE ANANOMY DROVE THE SEARCH FOR THE PARTICULAR SALTYPE BECAUSE WE COULD SEE IT CONNECTED IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO THE RIGHT CELLS AS IS TAT CREATES THE HYPOTHESIS LEST YOU GO QUERY THE PHYSIOLOGY THAT IT CAN GO THE OTHER WAY AS WELL SO IT'S ALWAYS THE SENERGY BETWEEN THESE FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL RAPPROACHES IT GIVES YOU THE THE MOST A LIFT BUT A YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES THE ANATOMY HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT THE WEAK SISTER IN THIS THE STRUCTURE OR TRYING TO WORK OUT THE DIAGRAM BECAUSE HAVEN'T HAD THE METHODS NOW THE METHODS EXIST AND THIS WHOLE FIELD IS IS EXPANDING VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT THESE CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS FOR THE PARTICULAR PART OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEIRE WORKING ON IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE SALE TYPES AND HE CONNECTIONS HA OW DO YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT THE MACHINE WORKS YE WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IS  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND AS SCIENTIS WE DON'T ASK QUESTIONS WE POSED HYPOTHESES HYPOTHESES BEING OF COURSE SOME PREDICTION THAT YOU WAGER YOUR TIME ON BASICALLY RIGHT AND IT EITHER TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE OR NOT TRUE A BUT IF YOU DON'T KNO THAT A PARTICULAR SELTYPE IS THERE YOU COULD NEVER IN ANY CONFIGURATION OF LIFE A OR A CAREER WERE EXPLORATION OF A NERVOUS SYSTEM WAGER A HYPOTHESIS BECAUSE HEDEN KNOW IT WAS THERE STHIS ALLOWS YOU SAY AH THERES IS A LITTLE INTERESTING LITTLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS CELL THAT I KNOW IS INTERESTING IN ANOTHER CELL THAT'S A LITTLE MYSTERIOUS BUT INTERESTING I'M GOING TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT IT'S DOING BLANK BLANKAND BLANK AND GOTEST THAT AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE CONNECT TOMES YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW THAT THAT SELL WAS LURKING THERE IN IN TE SHADOWS RIGHT RIGHT YET AND IF YOU JUST TRIED TO UNDERSTAND HOW INFORMATION FLOWS THROUGH THIS BIOLOGICAL MACHINE YOU ONT'T KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE YOU KNOW NARROW TRANSMITTERS ARE DUMPED OUT OF THE TERMINALS OF ONE CELL AND THEY DIFFUSE ACROSS THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO CLLS WHICH IS KIND OF E LIQUIDY SPACE AND THEY HIT SOME RECEPTORS ON THE POSTNAPTIC CELL AND HAVE SOME IMPACT SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT THROUGH A REGULAR SYNAP SOMETIMES IT'S TO A NEUROMODULATOR LIKE YOU OFTEN TALK ABOUT IN YOUR PODCAST TIT AR SORT OF DOSEN DO'T E MO EXACTLY LOSING INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE CELLS ND IT MAY BE ACTING AT SOME DISTANCE FAR FROM WHERE IT WAS RELEASED RIGHT BUT YIF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE RELEASE IS HAPPENING AND WE ARE OTHER THINGS ARE THAT MIGHT RESPOND TO THAT RELEASE YOUR GROPING AROUND IN THE DARK I LOVE THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS AND AM I HAVE TO SHARE WITH A THE LISTENERS THAT AT THE FIRST TIME I EVER MET DAVID AND EVERY TIME I'VE EVER MET WITH THIM IN PERSON AT LEAST AT HIS LABORATORY AT BROWN HE WAS IN HIS OFFICE DOOR CLOSED DRAWING NER ON AND THER CONNECTION S AND THIS IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL FOR SOMEBODY WHO SAY YOU KNOW INDOUBTFUL PROFESSOR OF CHAIRMAN THE DEPARTMENT AT CETERA FOR MANY YEARS OUT TO BE DOING THE HANDS ON WERE TYPICALLY THAT'S THAT'STUFF THAT'S DONE BY TECHNICIONS OR GRADUATES IN SURPOSETOCTS BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU REALLY LOVE LOOKING AT NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND DRAWING THE ACCURATE RANDITIONS OF HOW THOSE NERVOUS SYSTEMS ARE ORGANIZED AND THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY WORK NOW IT'S PURE JOY FOR ME A MAN AM A VERY VISUAL PERSON MY WIFE IS AN ARTIST WETHLOOK A LOT OF AR TOGETHER JUST THE FORMS OF THINGS ARE ARE GORGEOUS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT BUT TO KNOW THAT THE FORM IS IN A SENSE THE FONCTION THAT THEY THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE CONACTIVITY IS HOW THE COMPUTATION HAPPENS IN THE BRAIN AT SOME LEVEL EVEN TOUGH WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT IN MOST CONTECT GIVES ME IN A GREAT JOY CAS I'M WORKING ON SOMETHING THI BOTH VISUALLY BEAUTIFUL BUT ALLSO DEEPLY BEAUTIFUL IN A SORT ABOUT HIER SORT OF FA KNOWLEDGE CONTEXT OU KNOW WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT LOF IT WAT IS A FINAL QUESTION I GET ASKED VERY OFTEN ABOUT HOW PEOPLE SHOULD LEARN ABOUT NEROUS SCIENCE AM WOR HOW THEY SHOULD GO ABOUT PURSUING MAYBE AN EDUCATION IN NERO SCIENCE IF THE AT THAT STAGE OF THEIR LIFE FOR THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR CURRENT TROJECTORY DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE TO YOUNG PEOPLE OLD PEOPLE AND ANYTHING IN BETWEEN ABOUT HOW TO LEARN ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MORE MAYBE IN A MORE FORMAL WAY I MAN OVOSY WE HAVE OUR PODCASTS THE OR OTHER AM SOURCES OF NERVOUS SCIENCE INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT FOR THE YOUNG PERSON WHO THINKS THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE BRAIN I THEY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT THE BRAIN WHAT SHALL WE TELL THEM WET IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THERE'S SO MANY SOURCES OUT THERE ITS ALMOST A QUESTION OF YN HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THIS AVALANCHE OF INFORMATION OUT THERE I THINK ER PODCAST IS A GREAT WAY FOR PEOPLE TO TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND AN ACCESSIBLE WAY BUT THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF OUT THERE AND ITS IS NOT JUST THAT MING THE RESOURCES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE VEL FOR AVERAGE FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE IN NERVOUS CIENCE RESEARCH ON SOME LEVEL THERE'S TIS FAMOUS IYHWIRE PROJECT OF SUBASIANSOS I ABOUT IYWIRE YES SO THAT'S CONNECT TOMIX AND THAT'S  A IS SITUATION WHERE A VERY CLEVER SCIENTISTS REALIZE THAT THE THE PHYS ICAL WORK OF DOING ALL THIS RECONSTRUCTION OF NRONS FROM THESE ELECTRON MICROGRAPHS IS A LOT OF TIME IN VOLVE MANY MANY PERSON OURS HAVE TO GO INTO THAT TO COME UP WITH THE MAP THAT YOU WANT OF WHERE THE SELLS ARE AND HE WAS VERY CLEVER ABOUT SETTING OUP A CONTECT IN WHICH HE COULD CROWD SOURCEIS AND PEOPLE WERE INTEROUS IN GETTING A LITTLE EXPERIENCE LOOKING AT NERVOUS TISSUE IN PARTICIPATING IN A RESEARCH PROJECT COULD LEARN HOW TO DO THIS AN DO A LITTLE BIT FOM THEIR LIVING ROOM FROM THEIR LIVING THE PUT A LINK TO IYEWIRE THAT'S IT ALSO IS A GREAT BRIDGE BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE JUST LOKE ABOUT CONICTOMICS AND I SHOULD PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH RIGHT AND YOU DON'T NEED A GRADUATE MEN TOOR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT RIGHT I SAW TO MORE OF THIS IS COMING AND I'M ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN BUILDING MORE OF THIS  SO THET OPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED ANT A PARTICIPATED SOME LEVEL DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE TIME OR RESOURCES TO GET INVOLVED IN LABORATORY RESEARCH CAN CAN GET EXPOSED TO IT IN AND PARTICIPATE AND ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE IM SO I THINK THAT'S I YOUWANT ONE THING I MAY JUST ASKING QUESTIONS OF THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU WHO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE AND HAVE THEM POINT YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION HERE'S A BOOK YOU MIGHT LIKE TO READ THERE'S LOS OF GREAT POPULAR A BOOKS OUT THERE THETARE ACCESSIBLE THAT WILL GIVE YOU SOME MORE SENSE OF THE FULL RANGE OF WHAT'S OUT THEREING THE NERVOUS SCIENCES AND HOW WE CAN PUT SOME LINGS TO A FEW OF THOSE THAT WE LIKE RIGT  ON BASIC NEROU SCIENCE MY A GOOD FREND DIC MASLIN THE LATE RICHARD A PEOPLE CALL HEM DICTIC MASLIN I HAD A GOOD BOOK IM I I FORGET THE TITLE AT THE MOMENT AD AT SITTING BEHIND ME SOMEWHERE OVER THE ON THE SHELF BUT IM ABOUT VISION AND HOW NERVOUS SYSTEMS WORK O A PRETTY ACCESSIBLE BOOK FOR THE GENERAL POBLEC RIGHT RIGHT SO YOUNOW THAT AND AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S SO MANY SOURCES OUT THERE A MEAN WICKAPETY IS A GREAT WAY YOU OUGHT A PARTICULAR QUESTION BHAT VISUAL FUNCTION I WOULD SAY BY ALL ME AS YOU KNOW HAD THE WICK OBEDIENCE AND GET THE FIRST LOOK AND FOLLOW THE THE REFERENCIS FROM THERE OR GO YOUR LIBRARY OR YOUNO THERE THERE'S SO MANY WAYS TO GET INTO IT IT SUCH AN EXCITING FIELD NOW HERE'S SO MANY EMMY ANY PARTICULAR REALM THAT SPECIAL TO YOU YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR U KNOW YOUR STRENGTH YOUR PASSIONS AH THERE'S HERE'S A FIELD OF NERVOU SCIENE DEVOTED TO THAT YV YOU'V FORGOT IF YOU KNOW SO MANY'S GONE A ANEROLOGICAL PROBLEM OR AH A PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEM THRE'S A BRANCH OF NERVOU SCIENCE THAT IS DEVOTED TO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND TO SALL THESE KINDS OF PROMIS DOWN THE LINE IM SO FEEL THE FEEL THE BUZZ IS I'S AN EXCITING TIME TO TO GET INVOLVED GREAT THOSE ARE GREAT RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE ZERO COST AS YOU MEAN INTERNE CONNECTION BUT ASIDE FROM THAT WE'LL PUT THE LINKS TO SOME AND I'M REMEMBERING IM DICK'S BOOK IS CALLED OT WE KNOW IT WHEN WE SEE IT I IM ONE AM I HEROS YET A WONDERFUL COLLEG WHO IN FORESHILLING WE LOST A FEW YEARS AGO BUT IM LISTEN DAVID THIS HAS BEEN WONDERFUL IM AN A BLAS WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS AS A PEOPLE PROBABLY REALIZED BY NOW IM YOURE AN INCREDIBLE WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ENTIRE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO DAY WE JUST HIT THIS A TAUPT CONTOUR OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS TO GIVE A FLAVOR OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS AND IS ORGANIZED AND HOW THAT'S PUT TOGETHER IM NOW THESE AIRIERS ARE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER HEN I LOVE ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOUR SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EDUCATOR AND AND I'VE TAUGHT SO MANY STUDENTS OVER THE YEARS BUT ALSO IM FOR ME PERSONALLY I AS FRIENDS BUT ALSO ANY TIME THAT I WANT TO TOUCHING TO THE THE BEAUTY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM  IE RARELY LOSE TOUCH WITH HAT BUT ANY TIME I WANT A TOUCHING TO IT AND AND START THINKING ABOUT NEW PROBLEMS AND WAYS THAT IM THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS DOING THINGS THAT I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT I CALL YOU SO I A PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR CALLS PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE UNLESS YOU CAN A NUMBER  IF YOU DO I  I'S SUTTAIN IN SUCH A BLAST A ANY IN AND THIS HAS BEEN AGRETA SESSION AND IT'S ALWAYS FUN TALKING TO YOU ITS ALWAYS GETS MIGHTY A BRAIN RACING SO THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME TO DAY FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR DAVID BURSEN BY NOW

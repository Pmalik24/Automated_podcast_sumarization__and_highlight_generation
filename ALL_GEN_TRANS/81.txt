JUST WHY LEST WE FORGET HERE IS THE PRESIDENT OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY NOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT UNABLE TO SAY THAT CALLS FOR GENICIDE AGAINST JEWS ON CAMPUS VIOLATE THE COLLEGES POLICIES ON FREE SPEECH AND DOCTOR GAY AT HARVARD DOES CALLING FOR THE GENICIE O JEWS VIOLATE HARVARD'S RULES OF BULLYING AND HARASSMENT YES OR NO IT CAN BE DEPENDING ON THE CONTECT WHAT'S THE CONTEXT HARGEDED AS AN

SEMATISM I WILL ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME OES CALLING FOR THE GENICIDE OF JEWS VIOLATE HARVARD'S RULES OF BULLYING AND HARASSMENT YES OR NO ANTICEMITIC RHETORIC AND ISN'T ANTI MATIRATORAT ANTICEMITIC RETORIC WHEN IT CROSSES INTO CONDUCT AT AMOUNTS TO BULLYING ARASSMENT INTIMIDATION THAT IS ACTIONABL CONDUCT AND WE DO TAKE ACTION SO THE ANSERIS YES THAT CALLING FOR THE GENICIDE OF JEWS VIOLATES HARVARD COTE OF CONDUCT CORRECT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTACT IT DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE CONTEXTS THE ANSWER IS YES AND THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD RESIGN THESE ARE UNACCEPTABLE ANSWERS ACROSS THE BOARD GAY MADE THOSE STATEMENTS AFTER ISSUING A WEEK STATEMENT COMPLAINING ABOUT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION UN LEASHED ON OTOBER SEVENTH AN ISRAEL WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO HOMASS HARVARD STUDENTS TESTIFIED ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS OF UNEASE ON CAMPUS ON EAS UNDERSCORED BY ACTUAL ATTEMPTED VIOLENCE AGAINST SOME PRO ISRAEL STUDENTS ALLEGEDLY INCLUDING BY MEMBERS OF THE HARVARD LAW RO VIEW AFTER THAT INSANE EXCHANGED WITH STEPHANIC AFTER ALL HARVARD ISN'T EXACTLY A HOTBED OF FREE SPEECH BEING ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE CAMPSARS IN AMERICA ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HOPON TOPICS CLODING GAY CAME UNDER EVEN MORE FIRE THE WASHINGTON FREEBEACON DID PULLETS ARE LEVEL WORK AND UNCOVERING HER ACADEMIC CHARLATANISM BY MID DECEMBER THE FREEBEACON HAD UNCOVERED DOZENS OF ALLIGATIONS OF HER PLATURISM THEN ON MONDAY NIGHT THE FREEBEACON REVEALED EVEN MORE EXAMPLES OF PLATURISM WHAT HARVARD OUPHAMISTICALLY TURNED QUOT TO PLICATIVE LANGUAGE WITHOUT PROPER ATTRIBUTION TAND TO PLICAT OF LANGUAGE WITHOUT PROPER ATTRIBUTION IS CALLED PLATRISM THERE'S WORD FOR IT BUT STILL HARVARD TRIED TO KEEP HER ON THEY HAD TO SHE OF COURSE WAS THE POSTER CHILD FOR THEIR COR PHILOSOPHY DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION OR D E I WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ALL INEQUALITY OF GRUPOUTCOME IS DUE TO SOME SORT OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE SYSTEM THAT CAN ONLY BE CORRECTED FOR BY FORMS OF ACTUAL DISCRIMINATION IN PRACTICE TO ALLOW THAT CLOUDINGAY SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOTT EN THE POSITION SHE WAS IN THAT HER ACADEMIC RECORD WAS SCANTY THAT SHE HAD INVOLVES HERSELF IN NO ORIGINAL GROUND BREAKING WORK HAVY EMPHSIS ONWARD ORIGINAL HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ADMIT THAT SHE ACTUALLY GOT THE JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS A BLACK FEMALE AND TO THE LEFTIS PALORS THO B HAD TO MAINTAIN THA SHEECTUALLY DESERVED THE JOB THE HEAD OF THE END OF LACY P SAID THAT THOSE WHO WANTED GATE TO GO WERE ENGAGING AND QUOT NOTHING MORE THAN THEATRICS ADVANCING A WHITE SUPREMASIST A GENDA DOZENS OF BLACK HARVARD FACULTY MEMBERS WROTE AN OPEN LETTER PROCLAMING UOT ANY SUGGESTION THAT HER SELECTION AS PRESIDENT WAS THE RESULT OF A PROCESS THAT ELEVATED AN UN QUALIFIED PERSON BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS OF RACE ENGENDER ARE SPECIOUS AND POLITICALLY MOTIVATED BUT OF COURSE THAT IS WHY SHE HAD THE JOB HER RACE AND HER GENDER SHE WAS NOT QUALIFIED SHE HAD THE RIGHT INTEROSECTIONAL QUALITIES TO MAINTAIN HER JOB SHE WASN'T TO BLACK MAL WITH HETERODOCX'S LEANINGS LIKE ROLAN FIRE THE ECONOMIST WHO HAD TO BUNKED NOTIONS OF DISPROPORTIONAT ANTI BLACK POLICE SHOOTINGS AND THEN GOT ALSTED FROM HARVARD OVER A BUNCH OF SPECIOUS ALIGATIONS OF SEXUAL RASMENT SHE WASN'T THE JEWISH MAL LIKE LARRY SUMERS FROM HER PRESIDENT WHO IS AUSTED AFTER POINTING OUT THAT THE LACK OF WOMEN IN STEMFIELDS MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH BOTH SKILLS  DISTRIBUTION AND DESIRED TO ENTER THE STEM WORLD BY WOMAN CLOUDING GAY WAS A FAR LEFT BLACK WOMAN AND HER IMUNITY WAS ABSOLUTE UNTIL IT WASN'T AND A PROBABLY CAME NOT ABSOLUTEES PEOPLE SAR PULLING THEIR MONEY NOW THE QUESTION IS WHETHER AMERICANS WILL BE SATISFIED TO LEAVE D E I IN PLACE WITH GA GONE WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE WRONG IN ORDER TO LEAVE D  I IN PLACE THE LEFT REQUIRES A NARRATIVE A NARRATIVE THAT GA WAS ACTUALLY A MARTYR BECAUSE EITHER SHE WAS A GRIFTER WHO ABUSED AT D E I OR SHE WAS A MARTYR OR D I IS ITSELF A GRIFT THE LEFT CAN'T CALL HER A GRIFTER BECAUSE THAT MIGHT OPEN THE DOOR ON ALL THE OTHER GRIFTERS OR MEMBERS OF THE D E  CONTINGENT PRICTABLY THOSE RACE SGRIFTERS ARE THEREFORE CALLING HER A MARTYR TODAY SO MARK LEMONT HILL WHO MAKES AN ENTIRE LIVING SUGGESTING THAT VIRTUALLY ALL IN EQUALITY IN AMERICAN LIFE IS THE RESULT OF INEQUITY HE IMMEDIATELY TWEATED THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF HOVARD UNIVERSITY MUST BE A BLACK WOMAN WHY WHY CLOUDINGATED SUCH A SPECTACULAR JOB THAT WEANS OMEN WHO LOOKS JUST LIKE HER LIKE WHAT WHAT WIDE WHY OR FOR EXAMPLE NECOL HANNAJONES WHOS MANE ENTIRE LIVING OFF OF BEING IN ABSOLUTELY UNQUALIFIED HACK HISTORIAN TERRIBLE AT HER JOB HASN'T WRITTEN ANYTHING FOR THE NEAR TIMES IN A COUPLE OF YEARS I BELIEVE KEEPS GETTING OFFERED PREFESORIAL POSITIONS TO SPITE HER COMPLETE BACHERY OF AMERICAN HISTORY SHE TWETED OUT WELL THEY GOT WHAT THEY WANTED FROM THEIR WELL EXECUTED PLAN THE THE THEY OF COURSE PRESUMABLY BEING THE WHITE SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POWER IN AMERICA OR FOR EXAMPLE CORNAL LEST WHO WAS SUCH A LACK LUSTER ACADEMIC WHEN HE WAS AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY THA WHO'S ALSTED FOR NEVER HAVING WRITTEN ANYTHING HE LITERALLY HAD RELEASED A RAP ALBUM AND NO PAPERS AND SO THEY GOT RID OF HIM WAS THERE ON THIS HAPPEN AND THEN HE ENDED UP AT PRINCETON BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT IN TER SECTIONAL QUALIFICATIONS IN AMERICAN ACANDEMIC LIFE YHOU FAIL UPWARDS CORNEL LEST TWEETED OUT HOWSAD BUT PRINCTABLE THAT THE SAME FIGURES AND FORCES ENABLING THE EFFINIT CLEANSING AN GENOCIDAL ATTACKS ON PALSTINIANS AND GAZA ACMAN BLOOM SUMMERS AND OTHERS PUSH OUT THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN PRECIDENT OF HARVARD AH YOU SEE IT'S ALL THE JEWISH CONSPIRACY TO GET RID OF CLOUDYAN GAY THIS RACISM AGAINST BOTH PALISTINIANS AND BLACK PEOPLE IS UNDENIBLE AND DISPICABLES O CLOUDING GAGOS AND THAT'S RACIS M AGAINS PALISTINIANS I'VE EXPERIENCE SIMILAR ATTACKS FROM THE SAME FORCES IN ACADEMIA WITH TOO MANY OF MY COLLEGUES REMAINING SILENT WHEN BIG MONEY DICTATES UNIVERSITY POLICY AND RAW U POWAR DICTATES FORN POLICY THE MORAL BANKRUPTCY OF AMERICAN EDUCATION AN DEMOCRACY LOOMS LARGE BUT WE SHALL REMAIN STRONG IN OUR FIGHT FOR TRUTH JUSTICE LOVES IS CORNELL WEST WH'S BEEN SPENDING HIS DAYS STANDING UP FOR COMMASS WHO LOVE NEITHER TRUTH NOR JUSTICE NOR LOVE OR ASHA HADALE A DEEPLY TERRIBLE COLONIST WHO TWEATED OUT CRIS RUFO AND BAD FATH RIGHTWING ACTORS WIN AGAIN OH YOU MEAN BECAUSE CRISRUFO REPORTED THAT SHE WAS A PLATRIS I'M SORRY THAE JOURNALIS MAN HAPPENED TO YOU THAT'S A SAD ONE THE JOURNALISMING HAPPEN TO YOU MEANWHILE IBER MA KENEDY TWEATED OUT REPEATEDLY ON H MATTER HE SUGGESTED QUOTE WHEN A RACIST MOB ATTACK A BLACK PERSON IT FINDS A SEEMINGLY LEGITIMATE REASON FOR THE ATTACK THAT ALLOWS FORT TO A CROUPOPULAR SUPPORT IN CREDIBILITY WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE GROWING MOB TO DENY THER ATTACKING THE PERSON IN THIS WAY BECAUSE THE PERSON IS BLACK NOW I MEAN WHAT'S WEARD ABOUT THIS IS THAT LISMAGILL WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF PEN IS NO LONGER THE PRESIDENT OF PEN INCHIS WHITE LADY AND CHOS ALSTED WITHOUT ANY ALLIGATIONS OF PLATURISM BECAUSE SHE MADE THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MAY IN FONT F THE LEAS STOPHANNIC OVER UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLLANIA ALSO THIS NOT THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF A MAJOR UNIVERSITY TO BE ALSTED OVER RESEARCHFROM IS CONDUCT MARTES YOUR LEVIN OF STANFORD HAD RESIGNE OVER RACSEARCH MIS CONDUCT AS S BACK IN JULY WHEN ALL THAT LONG AGO BUT ITR MAX KENDY SAYS THAT EFFECTIVELY SPEAKING ANY TIME A BLACK PERSON IS CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR OWN SINS WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED CLOUDING GAY THAT IS IN ASPECT OF RACISM AND ALL THE REST OF IT IS BASICALLY JUST FOR SHOW ITR MAX KENDY WHO IS INDEED THE D YI GRIFTER PAR EXCELLANT A PERSON WHO CANNOT DEFINED THIS FROM RACISM WHITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE WORD RACISM HE LITERALLY DEFINES THE TEMRAISM AS RACISM IS A SERIES OF RACIST POLICIES IN PURSUIT OF A RACIST IDEOLOGY WHICH IS MOST CIRCULAR DEFINITION YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE IT MAX KENDY HAS CLEARED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLARS FOR BEING A TERRIBLE SCHOLAR WHO LIES ABOUT AMERICA AND AMERICAN HISTORY ITR MEX KENEDY RESPONDED TO A TWEED FROM SOME ONE SANQUAT WE ARE RETURNING TO A COLOR BLINE PERFORMANCE SBASE SOCIETY WERE HE JUDGE PEOPLE BY THEIR CHARACTER AFFORT AND ACHIEVEMENTS AND IT MEX KENDY SAYS THIS IS THE PROPAGANDA OF HISTORY TO USE DUTELY BEE TO BLASTERM THAT THEY WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE AT WE SHOULD RETURN TO THE COLOR BLIND PERFORMANCE BASE SOCIETY OF MASSING CARCERATION OF JIM CROW OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS OF LINCHINGS OF SLAVERY OF SETTLER COLONIALISM YES BECAUS THOUGH THOSE THOSE WHERE THE CHOICIS THE CHOICES WERE KEEP CLOUDING GAY OR YOUARE IN FAVOR OF MASING CARCERATION JIM CROW C CENTRATION CAMS WINCHINGS SLAVERY AND SETTLER COLONIALISM ACCORDING TO IBERMAX CENDY AGAIN THE REASON THEY ARE ALL STANDING UP FOR CLOUDING GATE IS BECAUSE ONCE THE GRIFT IS EXPOSED AT CAN NO LONGER BE USED AND THEY REQUIRE THE REQUIRE THE GRIFT TO BE USED THEY OF COURSE ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE GRIFT IS WHY ALL THE GRIFTORS ARE OUT OF LUDWORK ON THIS ONE IT'SWHY AL SHARPTON IS OUT THEIRE MAKING HIS USUAL GRIFTY STATEMENS AL SHARPTON WHO'SE SPENS IS ENTIRE ADOLT LIKE LYING ABOUT AMERICA AND BY THE WAY OVERTLY LYINE ABOUT SITUATIONS INCLUDING TOON A BRALLEY INHELPING TO INSITE RYOTS IN NEW YORK  THACY WHO HAS A SHOW ON AMES AND BECES SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE SHE IS A QUOINCLAT BLACK LEADER THEUG WHAT FLOCK E LEADS IS UP TO ANYBODY TO TO DISCOVER HE SAYS QUOTE PRESIDENT GAZE RESIGNATION IS ABOUT MORE THAN A PERSON OR A SINGLE INCIDENT THIS IS AN ATTACK ON EVERY BLACK WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO'SE PUT A CLACK A CRACK IN THE GLASSYLIN SO QUESTION FOR THEBLACK WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY ARE ALL OF YOU PLAGERISTS WHY EXACTLY WOULD HER BEING ALSET FOR BEING A BAD PRESIDENT WHO SHIELD ANTY SEMETISM ON HER CAMPAS AND ALSO A PLAGERIST WHY WOULD THAT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON YOU THI THIS IS SUPERCONFUSING TO ME I GOT I GOT A TELL YOU AM YU WENT WHEN WEN MARK TESIAR LEVING WOS ALSTED FROM STANFERT UNIVERSITY THAT'S A WHITE DUD IS A CANADIAN AMERICAN ATYNTHING WAW A SEALING HAS NOW BEEN SET UP FOR CANADIAN AMERICAN WHITE DUDES IS JO WEIRD TAKE BUT THE UNSPOKEN ASSUMPTION HERE OBVIOUSLY IS THAT THE REASON THAT SHOOSE PUT IN PLACES BECAUSE SHOS A BLACK WOMAN THEREFORE THE REASON THAT SHE WAS REMOVED FROM HER POSITION IS BECAUSE SHE WAS A BLACK WOMAN THE REALITY IS SHOOSE REMOVED FROM HER POSITION DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHEAS A BLACK WOMAN HARVARD WAS FIGHTING AS HARD AS IT COULD TO MAINTAIN HER THIS PRESUMABLY IS WHY ERIC DEGGINS AT N PAR ALSO TO TOQUOTE THE INTIMIDATION IS THE POINT WELL THE NEXT PRESIDENT AT HARVEARD STAND FOR DIVERSITY WILL

THIS WAS THE PROMISE THAT JOBIDAN MADE ON COMING TO THE WITE HOUSE WHICH HIS A DIFFERENT PROMISE THEN WHAT HE MAY DURING THE CAMPAIGN DORIN CAMPAIGN HE SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE A MODERATE WHO GOVERNED FRALL AMERICANS AND PON ENTERING IMMEDIATELY HE STARTED CALKING BY HEQUITY WOULD BE AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING THEY DO BUT YEN EQUITY AN A QUOLITY NOT REMOTELY THE SAME THING A QUALITY IS THE IDEA THAT EVERY ONE OUGHT TO BE TREATED EQUALLY THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING IS EVERYONE OUGHT TO HAVIN EQUAL OUTCOME WHICH IS WHAT EQUITY IS ALL ABOUT HERE'S COREEN JOHN PIERR WHO HERSELF IS  D I PRODUCT SHE'S TERRIBLE AT HER JOB BUT CHOOSE A POINTED FOR HER DIVERSITY QUOCEON HERE SHE IS THE PRESS SECRETARY SUGGESTING THAT EQUITY IS AGAIN AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING JOBITON DOES THE PRESENT HAS ALWAYS ALWAYS PUT EQUITY AT THE SENTER OF EVERY POLITY IS PUT FOR IT EVERY LEGISLATION THAT HES FUT PUT FORIT CAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT MANY COMMUNITYIS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND HAVE BEEN LEFT OF BEHIND WERE NOT TRYIND TO DO THE TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS AGAIN SHE'S NOT WRONG EVERY BIDEN POLICY IS GEARE TOWARD THIS IDEA OF EQUAL OUTCOME AND THEY WILL RUN ROUGH SHOT OVER INSTITUTIONS ROUGH SHOT OVER THE LAW IN ORDER TO GET THERE THIS WHY CREEN CHON PAREN THE SAE INTERVIEW SHE'S TOING OHOUT JOBIDON UNILATERALLY TOOK ACTION ON SOON LONS ILLEGALLY BECAUSE AGAIN THE IDEA WAS THAT EQUITY HAD TO BE ESTABLISHE NO THER E DON'T  NO YO WE NO ON A OTER S AND I WANTE AND IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEARD FROM YOU THAT I SENTIALLY THIS AS SOMETHING PRESIDENT HAS TRIED TO DO AND DO YOU THINK THAT OVER TIME THEY START TO FEEL LIKE TRYING ISN'T A DOT NO BUT I WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY WHAT I WAS GOT A FINISH AND SAY IS THAT THE PRESENT EVEN THOUGH HIS PLAN WAT STOP HE WAS ABLE TO TAKE ACTION AND WE'RE ABLE TO OT WER ABLE TO I GET RID ABOUT TA HUNDRED AND TAR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF DAT A MORE THAN THAT FOR MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF FOLKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT MATTERS THAT MES SO HE STILL TOOK ACTION HE STILL TOOK CTION EVEN THOUGH HIS HANDS WERE A TIDE AGAIN THIS IS ALL WHAT EQUID IS EQUITY SUGGESTS OF COURSE THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS OF POLITICS BECAUSE THOSE ARE ALL OBSTRUCTIONIST ALL THOSE INSTITUTIONS OBSTRUCT EQUITY IT' YOU HAV TO RUN RIGHT OVER THEM IN PURSUIT OF THE QUALITY OF OUTCOME YOU DO IT ANDTHIS HAS PARTICULAR RAMIFICATIONS FOWARD THE AMERICAN BOARDER SO ONE OF THE BIG POLITICAL CONNUNDRUMS THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT DOWN THE COUNTRY IS THAT THE BORDER IS WIDE OPEN WIDE OPEN AND IT IS TOTALLY NOT UNDERSTANDBLE ON A POLITICAL LEVEL WHY PRECISELY THE BORDER SHOULD BE WIDE OPEN IT'S A HUGE MINSTAKT BY JOBIDON AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT HIS PALLING NUMBERS JOBIDON'S PALLING NUMBERS ON EMIGRATION ARE ABSOLUTELY AWFUL PEOPLE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS TRUST TRUMP MORE THAN BIDON WITH REGARD TO EMIGRATION IT'S APPROVAL RATING ON EMIGRATION OVER ALL IT'S DOWN TO THORTY EIGHT PER CENT IN THE LAST HARVARD CAPS HERIS POLL THOS ARE TERRIBLE NUMBERS FORTY SIX PER CENT BY THE WAY SO THAT THEY PROVED OF IT IN NOVEMBER TAN'S GOING TO GO DOWN EVEN FURTHER IF HE DOESN'T STOP WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE BORDER AND YET THE BI DEMINISTRATION WHICH HAS AN OUTRIGHT NOW THER'S THE PARTS TO MATING THEY'VE A POLITICAL OUT THE BI DEMINISTRATION COULD TO DAY SIGN A BILL A  YEAL WITH REPUBLICANS AND CONGRESS AND SIGN A BILL THAT WOULD GET THEM THE EUCRANADE THAT THEY WANT AND THAT EUCRANE DOES IN FACT NEED GET THE AID TO ISRAEL THAT ISRAEL REQUIRES IN ORDER TO PURSUE ITS WAR WITH COMMASS AND POSSIBLY A WAR WITH CUSBELO IN ITS NORTH GIVE ARM'S PRETECTION TO TI WON AND ALSO SOLIDIFY THE BORDER AND JOBIDE WOULD BE ABLE ON A POLITICAL LEVEL TO GO BACK TO HIS LEFT TO DAILISON YOU GOTS WANT ED THE UCRANED I CULDN'T GET THAT WITHOUT SOLIDIFING THE BORDER AND THEN HEU COULD GO TO MODERATES IN AMERICA AND TAK GUIES YOU WANTED ME TO DO SOMETHIN ABOUT BORDER I DID SOMETHING ABOUT THEWOARDR BUT JO BIDON WON'T DO IT IT'S UNBELIEVABLE JOBIDON CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN AND OPEN BORDER POSITION THAN GAS LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY SAYING THT THE BORDER IS IN FACT BEING TAKEN CARE OF NOW WHY IS THAT WHY ARE THEY DOING S ME HERE'S CARRENGE ON PEARE DOING THIS YESTERDAY SUGGESTING THAT JOBIDON TOOK THE BORDER CRACES SERIOUSLY FROM THEY ONE WHICH OF COURSE IS A LIE NOW WEARE HAVIN WE BELIEVE A VERY PREDUCTIVE CONVERSATION INCONGRESS WITH SENATORS UNHOW DO WE MOVE FOR IT IN A BY PARTISAN AGREEMENT TO DEAL WITH THE BORD TO SECURITY THAT IS IMPORTANT NOW WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT WHEN CONGRESS STITS FACT WOLL BE ABLE TO ACT AND GET THESE THINGS MOVING FORWARD SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SOME OF THOSE MARES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT GOVERNORS A IN AND NORTHERN AND NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY ON DEALING WITH THE ISSUE THAT THEIRE DEALING WITH ON THE GROUND AND WE HAVE PROVIDED O TRESOURCES TO THEM AN WERE GEN IT CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT AGAIN CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACT THE PRESDENT TOOK THIS VERY SERIOUSLY UNDAY ONE THE PRESIDENT DID NOT TAKE THE SERIOUS THY UNTAY ONE THIS PRESENT HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE CAN TO KEEP THAT BORDER OPEN NOW WHY WHY IS THAT THE CASE THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THERE IS A DEEP IDEA LOGICAL BELIEF ON THE LEFT THAT SOMEHOW PEOPLE ARE ODE ENTRY TO THE UNITED STATES ANDTHERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT IT JUST TA CYNICAL PLOY THAT IT'S ABOUP BRINGING PEOPLE IN WILL THEN VO DEMOCRAT MAYBE THAT'S TRUE QUITE POSSIBLE THEYOU BELIE THEY DONO BRING A BUNCH PEOPLE IN WHORE UNDER EDUCATED WO DON'T HAVE QUALIFICATIONS FOR HIGLEVEL JOBS WILL AND UP BEING ON WELFARE ONCE THERE IN FACT GIVEN LEGAL STATUS BY A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION AND THEN WHO'LL GRATEFULLY VOTE DEMOCRAT FOR THE REST OF TIME THE GE THE CALIFORNIA MODEL AN THEY BELIEV THAT THEY CAN BROADLY APPLY THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON IT SYNICAL REASON BUT MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON OR MAYBE THERE'S A SYNICAL ECONOMIC REASON WHICH IS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVING FACILITATED POLICY THAT STAGNATES THE ECONOMY REQUIRES A CHEAP SUPPLY OF LABOR FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT ECONOMY HUMMING COULD BE THAT IS WELL OR MAYBE THE'S SOMETHING EVEN MORE DEEPLY IDEALOGICAL HERE WHICH IS THE EQUITY ARGUMEN WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY THAT AMERICA IS AN UNJUST TERRIBLE FORCE IN THE WORLD AND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO PAY FOR ITS SINS IS TO KEEP THAT BORDER WIDE OPEN WHATEVER IT IS THE THE EQUITY ORRIENTATION OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS LEAVING SOME PRETTY HERRIFIC POLICY ACCORDING TO THE WALSTRY JOURNAL THE BY DMINISTRATION HAS NOW ASKED THE SUPREME QUORT TOLOW THE BORE PATRAL TO CUT TEXASES RAZOR WIRE SO TEXAS HAS PUT UPON TO RAZOR WIRE ON THE BORDER E DRYING STOP PEOPLE FROM SIMPLY CROSSING IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO BORDER CROSSING AND JOBIDON ONCE THE BORDER PATRAL TO CUT THE BORDER WIRE WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THAT WHAT WOULD THE POSSIBLE RATION OUT FOR THAT BE ACCORDING THE WALSTRY JOURNAL THE BY DEMINISTRATION ASK THE SUPREME QUORT ON TUESDAY TO REINSTATE FEDERAL AUTHORITY OVER THE INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN MEXICOANE TEXAS AFTER STATE OFFICIALS ONE A LOWER QORT ORDER BLOCKING THE OTHBOR PATROL FROM REMOVING CONCERTINO WIRE TEXAS OFFICERS HAD INSTALLED TO DETERMIGRANTS FROM CROSSING A TWENTY NINE MILE STRETCH OF THE REAL GROUND THE MOVE REPRESENTS TO GET ANOTHER VOLLEY IN TH INCREASING CONFLICT BETWEEN TEXAS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERMEN OVER BORDER IN FORCEMEN STATE TROOPERS AN NATIONAL GIRDSMEN DEPLOYED BY THE STATE LEAD MILES OF RAZOR WIRE AS PART OFTHE STATES OPERATION LONE STAR BORDER SECURITY EFFORT THE OPERATION IS SPENT OR ALICATED MORE THAN ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS SINCE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY'VE SOUGHT TO CHALLEGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SOLL AUTHORITY OVER INTERNATIONAL BORDERS AND NOW THE BY DEMINISTRATION IS LITERALLY SUING TEXAS TO STOP THEM FROM PUTTING OBSTRUCTIONS ON THE BORDERS TO STOP ILLEGAL IMOGRATION THAT'S INSANE THAT'S TOTALLY WILD BU JUST ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL I WOULDN'T JOBIEN LOOKE THE OTHER WAY AIN'T THAT THAT IS JUST CLEAR HOST THAT SO WE WON'T IN FORTH T HEMMIGRATION LAWS AN IF YOU DO WE WILL GO TO COURT TO STOP YOU TROM IN FORCING THE EMIGRATION LAWS MEANWHILE CORREEN JOHN PIARIS OUT THERE CLAIMING THAT ITS SHAMEFUL THAT MIGRANS ARE BEING BUSTO SANCTUARY CITY SO 'S LONG AS THEY ARE BEING IM PORTED INTO SMALL TOWNS AND TEXAS AND ARIZONA NO MEXICO IT'S TOTALLY VINE THE MAN YOU SEND THEM TO CHICAGO OR NEW YORK THAT'S AN ALL HELLBREAKS LOOSE ACCORDING COREENG JOHN PIERRE MORALLY SPEAKING THE THE BUST THE BUSTING OF MIGRANTE THE PUTTING THEM ONT FLIGHT IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT THAT IS A CURRING AND INSTEAD OF IF THE GOVERNOR REALLY TRULY ONTE THA DEAL WITH THISITION HISHOULD TALK TO I THE SENATOR IS IN HIS STATE UNBELIEVABLE A CA SO  JUST JUST TO MAKE CLEAR WE LOD PEOPLE SAY THE JOBIDON ASN'T REALLY CHANGED THE BORDER POLICY THAT'S NOT TRUCE THE MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE HAS A GOOD RUN DOWN ON EXACTLY WHAT JOBIDON HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF POLICY'S INSTAKING OFFICE THEY'S JUST IN THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION ACCORDING TO THEM FROM JANUARY TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO JANUARY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION THE BIN ADMINISTRATION TOOK FOUR HUNDRED AND THREE EMIGRATION RELATED ACTIONS ACCORDING TO MIGRATION PLICY INSTITUTE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO FOUR HUNRED AND SEVENTY THE ENTIRE PRESIDENCY OF DONAL TRUM JOBIDN HIMSELF CHANGED D  CHES

MAP OF THIS REGION WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS A COMMOSSES LOCATED IN THE GOSSISS TRIP WHICH IS THE SOUTH WESTERN PART OF ISRAELSING THE SOUTH WESTERN CORNER AND THEN ISBALLAT IS LOCATED IN ISRAEL'S NORTH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MISSILLS PPOINTED AT ISRAEL BOUT FIFTY THOUSAND THEM ER SMART WEAPONS CAPABLE OF ACTUAL TARGANING TECHNOLOGY MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED MUCH MORE DANGERAS THEN A CAMAS TO ISRAEL KISBALLAH HAS BEEN BASICALLY PROTTING ISRAEL AT THE NORTHERN BORDER THAT KILLED MONCH PEOPLE TOE NORTHERN BORB MANY OF THE KISBALLAT TERRAS HAVEBEN KILLED AT THE NORTHERN BOR ISRAEL HAS EVACUATED FOR LITERALLY MONTS THIS POINT SOME THIRTY TO FORTY THOUSAND IS ON PEOPLE A WAVE FROM THAT NORTHERN BORDER IN EXPECTATION OF A POSSIBLE ISBALLA ATTACK SO KISBALLAH WAS APPARENTLY HOUSING  SOME OF THE COMMAS LEADERSHIP ACCORDING THE TIMES V ISRAEL CMMASES DEPUTY LEADER ABROAD AN SELLA ALLARURI WANTED FOR YOURS BY ISRAEL AND SEENAS THE GROUPS PRIMARY ORCHISTRATOR OF WESTBANK TERRISM WAS KILLED TUESDAY EVENING IN ISRAELY STRIKE IN THE BEROOT SUBURB OF DAKIYA ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS WITH COMMAS AND THE LEBANY'S TERRAS GROUP KISBALLA ISRALLY OFFICIALS DECLINED TO COMMENT UNNAME TOOUS

REVENGE FOR THE CMMASCHIEF BEING KILLED IN BARRY WHICH HEGAN IS WERD COMMAS IS A DIFFERENT AND DISTINCT TERRAS GROUP FROM KISBALLANA KISBALLA IS REMARKING THAT ONCE REVENGE ON ISRAEL FRAVING KILLED A COMMAS TERRAS THE POSSIBILITY OF COMAS GOING HOT WITH ISRAEL OBVIOUSLY DRAMATICALLY HIGHER THEN IT WAS AND MEANWHILE THE WEST IS SAINT ISRAEL DON'T HOU GOT O AVOID ESCALLATION PARTICULARLY IN LEBANON OKET WELL HERE IS A GOD WAY OF DOING THAT WHAT IF THE WESTRA SAID TO THE LEBANY'S GOVERNMENT WHICH IS IN FACT DISTINCT FROM BUT HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY KISBALLA MOVE CISBALLA OFF THE BORDER END OF STORY MOVE THEM OFF THE BOARD THEEN THEN VIOLATION OF YOUN RESOLUTION BY WAY FOR THOSE RE WHO PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT THE UNITED NATIONS THERE IS A YOUAN RESOLUTION THAT PREVENS KISBALLAH FOR MILITORIZING THE NORTHERN BORDER OF ISRAEL THE MILITRIZE THE BORDER STHERE IN VIOLATION O INTERNATIONAL WAW IF THAT'S A THING H YOU CAREABOUT OR PRETEN TO CARREABOUT AND YET THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIS LIKE W ISRAEL REALLY SHOULD USE RESTRAINT WITH THIS TERRAS GROUP THAT IS THREATENING TO EVISRAKE NOT ONLY THOUSANDS REPITE TENS OF THOUSAND OF ISRAELIES AN DE ON FRENCH PRESIDENT AN MANUEL MC CRON IS CALLED ON

HUNDRED PEOPLE ANTOK ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY CAPTIVE THERE'S STILL DOZANS OF HOSTAGES BEING HELLD IN GAZA COMMAS CO ON THIS WORE LITERALLY ON MOMENT'S NOTICE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SURRENDER AND

PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS PIECE OF RECEARCH ON THIS AS AN OLD ONE CALLED THE PARRY PRIESCHOOL PROJECT THE STUDY BEGAN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THEY TOK A BUNCH OF POOR KIDS FROM IPSILANTI MICHIGAN PUT HALF OF THEM INTO A PRIESCHOOL PROGRAMM AND THEN THE OTHER HALF OUN OF JUST LED THEIR NORMAL LIVES AND THEN AFTER A YEAR OF THAT BOTH OF THOSE SCGROUPS WENT BACK INTO THE SAME PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THEN EVER SO OFTEN RECEARCHERS WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH THESE KIDS TO SEE HOW THEY WERE DOING FOR THE TWO GROUPS THE FOLLOWING THM STILL EVEN NOW AND THERE IS ALS HAVE BEEN AMAZING AT AGE TWENTY SEVEN THE KID WHO GOT PRIE SCHOOL WERE HALF AS LIKELY TO HAVE GOTEN ARRESTED THEY UNDER AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY PER CENT MORE PER MONTH THERE WERE FIFTY PER CENT MORE  LIKE W'D HAVE A SAMG IS A CCOUNT PTWENTY PERCENT MORE LIKE WOULD HAVE A CAR PRIESCHOOL KIDS GOT SICK LESS OFTEN ONE AND POYED LESS OFTEN SENTENCED TO INCARCERATION LESS OFTEN OTHER STUDIES SHOW SIMILAR RESULTS NOT JUST FOR POOR KIDS BUT FOR OTHER KIDS TOO THEY DO BETTER IF THEY HAVE PRIESCHOOL AND THE VERY FIRST STATE TO CHOOSE TO MAKE FREE HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL AVAILABLE TO ALMOST EVERY FOR YEURON IN THE STATE AND THEN NACTUALLY DELIVERED ON THAT PROMISE TURNS OUT TO BE A SURPRISING ONE FACT ONLY A HANDFUL EF STATES HAVE JOINED IT HAWLEXPLONBER REPORTS THAT THE STORY OF HOW THE STATE CAME TO LEAD THE NATION IN PRESCHOL ACCESS IS ALL ABOUT GETTING AWAY WITH IT QUICK REMINDER FOR WE START TO DAY SHOW AS A RERUN FROM A FEW YEARS AGO SINCE WE DID THIS STORY SOME DETAILS FOKOHOMA'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE HAD CHANGED HE'S AEX THE STATE IS OKLAHOMA AND TO SHOW YOU JUST HOUESURPRIZING THAT IS CONSIDER WHAT HAPPENED TO GUO NAME RAN PETERS PETERS WAS A FRESHMEN LEGISLATOR IN THE OKLAHOMA STATE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REPUBLICAN ONE OF ITS PARTY LEADERS A VETERAN LEGISLATOR CAME UP TO HIM ONE DAY AND SAID THE GOVERNOR ALSO A REPUBLICAN APPOINTED THIS TASK FOR US TO LOOK INTO THE ISSUE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THEY CAME UP WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE PUT INTO THIS BILL THE GOVERNOR WANTS US TO PASS IT WILL YOU BE IN CHARGE OF MAKING THAT HABIT AN MAS VERT WAS FREE MONDAY IN BILL STOI WAS HIS SAID PUBLIC PRIVIC PARTNERSHIP SAID BE PROV FONDIGE RON PETER SAID SHAR THE BILL SEEMED EASY TO PASS AND PRETTY NON CONTROVERSIAL THERE WERE NO STATE FUNDS INVOLVED WITH ALL PRIVATE MONEY THE IDEA WAS SIMPLY TO SET UP A NON PROFIT TO PUBLICIZE THE VALUE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SOME MORE PARENTS WOULD CONSIDER IT SO WE INTRODUCED THE BILL ON THE HOUSE FLOOR I DIDN'T NO THANGING BY WOULD BAT IT I MEAN HAD HE D BAT O NO JUST PA SECTORAS GONT RASE MONEY TO FUND THE WOR POK AN SOMECOULDN'T ARGUE ABOUT SINCE PIN STATE MONEY BUT AND THEY SAID WLL BE TO BATED UP SEVEN HANDS ON MY SAW THE IAND AT TO THE BIT AGAINST IT ID THIS IS A NANY STAE BILL CANS CON CON TIKEOR CADS AN RISIN FOR WE THIK HIT SHOULD BE RASE BY THE MAMAN DAD O'S LIKE TO OT THELI RUSHLIN LAR IN CARNETE I GOT THE LEGESLITERSLIKE TO THEA TITTLE PEOPLE HIT WERE THERE SO YOU THINK THERE'S ANYBOTY RIGHT OF YOU NOOH NO NE TUT THEY TE THE WHOLE HOLE MUNCHIM I GOT IT PASS AND THE PASS HE HOUSE PAST THE SENATE AND THEN ALL PEOPLE STORY INN LETTERS FROM THE FAR RIGHT WIG  SAYING TO THE GOVERNOR THIS IS HIS MANUSTATE BILL WHY WOELD YOU SECRECATES FROM THE HOSPITAL AN TIKE IM TO UTORISE FORS AN HE GOT HE GOT SCARED A LITTLE BIT I GUESS AND HEINIT BETS ON HIS OWN PASS FORCE BILL  WI ALOS I WAS TERBLIP SI ACTUALLY THE GOVERNOR ONLY THREATENED A VETAIL THAT IT WAS ENOUGH TO TELL PETERS BILL THAT TIN AROUND AND THAT IS HOW UNLIKELY IT IS TO PASS UNIVERSAL PUBLIC PRESCHOOL IN OKLAHOMA A BILL THAT SIMPLY SUGGESTS THAT THE STATE MIGHT THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR KIDS TO GO TO PRESCHOOL A BILL REMEMBER THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY STATE MONEY AND DOESN'T ACTUALLY SET UP ANY NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMS THAT BILL GETS A TACK AS SOCIALISM AS COTTLE OKLAHOMA IS ARGUBLY THE MOST CONSERVATIVE STATE IN THE COUNTRY SGOT A REPUBLICAN HOUSE A REPUBLICAN SENATE A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR FOR OUT OF ITS FIVE REPRESENTATIVES TO CONGRESS AR REPUBLICANS AS OUR BOTH AT SENATORS ONE OF THOSE SENATORS TOM COBURN WAS NAMED THE MOST CONSERVATIVE SENATOR IN CONGRESS BY NATIONAL REVIEW MAGAZINE AND IF YOU NEED MORE PROOF CONSIDER THIS OKLAHOMA WAS THE ONLY STATE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WERE NOT ONE SINGLE COUNTY VOTED FOR BRACOBAMA SO HOW IN THE WORLD THAT ANY ONE GET THE CONSERVATIVE STATE OF OKLAHOMA TO AGREE TO A DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF THE STATES PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN PREE SCHOOL SOMETHING THAT MANY CONSERVATIVES WOULD OPPOSE HOW DID ANY ONE GET AWAY WITH THAT THE ANSWER UNIVERSAL PUB LIC PREESCHOOL CAME TO OKLAHOMA NOTEST PART OF A BOLD EVIDENCE BASE CAMPAIGN IT WAS SNUCKIN IN THE DARK AND TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF JUST HALF SECRETLY AT HAPPENED CONSIDERED THIS RATHER AMAZING FACT AT THE TIME RON PETERS WAS GETTING HIS LITTLE BILL SQUASH BY HIS OWN PARTY IN THE LEGISLATURE UNIVERSAL PREESCHOOL WAS ALREADY IN PLACE IN OKLAHOMA ITIT BEEN VOTED INTO LAW THREE YEARS EARLIER LOTED G TO LAW BY MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCUSING RON PETERS OF SOCIALISM AND WAT'S MORE THEY HAD PROBABLY VOTED FOR THAT LAW WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT WHICH IS EXACTLY THE WAY  THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT PUBLIC PRE SCHOOL TO OKLAHOMA WANTED IT OT PC O  PPO THE STORY BEGINS IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINES AND IT BEGINS WITH A SEEMINGLY UNRELATED ISSUE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS AROUND OKLAHOMA HAD DISCOVERED A LOOPHOLE AND THE STATES SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA AND WERE USING THAT LOOPHOLE TO RUN A LITTLE SCHEME THAT INVOLVED KINDERGARDEN CLASSES AND HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY S THE SCHEME WAS IT WAS LEGAL IN OKLAHOMA FOR SCHOOLS TO HAVE EITHER A FULL DAY OR A HALF DAY KINDEGRATON PROGRAMME THE LOOPHOLE WAS THAT SCHOOLS GOT PAID THE SAME AMOUNT FROM THE STATE EITHER WAY AND SO WAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEGAN DOING WAS RUNNING TWO HALF DAY PROGRAMMS AND COLLECTING TWICE AS MUCH MONEY AND IF THEY COULDN'T FIND ENOUGH FIVE YEAR OLDS TO FILL TWO KINDERGRAEN CLASSES THEY WOULD HAD THEIR NUMBERS WITH FOUR YEAR OLDS WE WE GOT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THAT VERY VERY EARLY LOYD SNOW WAS THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDED AT THIS TIME WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE LOPHOLE RAN TWO HALF DAY KINDEGARDENS AND WRLE A BUNCH OF FOUR YEAR OLDS GOT PAID DOUBLE FROM THE STATE IT WAS LIKE A NO PRATER DID NOT ONLY BE ABLE TO DO THIS PUT IN PLAY AND IN HAVE MONEY WFT OWER FOR OTHERS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED UNDER FUNDAN EDUCATIONAL PROCESSES I M IT WIT WAS IT WAS A GOOD THING AND WE HAVEIT HAD VERY MANY GOOD THING A GOOD THINGS AND BOBLIC SCHOOLS AND MY ESTREMATION SO I DIDN'T BLANK WAS ALL AROUND THE STATE THE SCHEME SPREAD FOUR YEAR OLD WERE LIKE GOLD AND THE EXTRA MONEY THEY BROUGHT IN WHENT EVERYTHING FROM FOOTBALL PROGRAMMS TO NEW SCHOOL EQUIPMENT EVEN NEW BUILDINGS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DISTRICT OF JOE EDENS A STATE LEGISLATOR AROUND THIS TIME THERE WAS SO MUCH MONEY CAME WITH THESE CHILDREN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BOUGHT BUT WE CALL PORTABLE CLASH ROOMS O THE BIG MOBLEHOME OU KNOW THITZ  CLUNK IT TOGETHER IN AND  YOU'VE GOT A NICE CLAS ROOM A PREFI UP HERE THEY BOUGHT THE THE BUILDINGS PAID CASH FOR THEM WITH THE MONEY THE THE FIRST YEAR AN M US T IT S THAT MUCH GRAVY AND THEN FROM THEN ON THE YOUN TO USE THE BUILDINGS AN ISENCE FREE NOT MY TIME LI JOE WAS HAPPY ABOUT THIS BUT HE WASN'T THIS SEEMED LIKE A LOOPHOLE THAT PEOPLE WERE ABUSING AND SO FOR TWO YEARS HE TRIED TO CLOSE IT TO KEEP FOUR YEAR OLD OUT OF KINDEGRAT THEY GOT NOWHERE AND JOE EDDONS HE BECOME SENTRAL TO THE SCTORY OF UNIVERSAL PREE SCHOOL AND OKLEHOMA YOU'LL HEAR A LOT MORE FROM HIM LATER AFTER HE MEETS THIS NEXT GY ANOTHER MAIN CHARACTER IN THE SAGA A GY NAMED BOB PARBASON BOB HARBESON AS A SELF DESCRIBED TO CORPORIT GUY CONSERVATIVE SUITS TORTESHOW GLASSES HE WAS FOR MANY YEARS THE SENIOR MANAGER AT TET U AY AND AFTER THAT AND EXECUTIVE IN THE OIL IN GAS INDUSTRY HEWAS ALSO FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE ON THE BOARD OF THE TULSA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND ONE DAY A BANKER FRIEND OF MINE IT WAS THE INCOMING PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER BROUGHT ME AP PIECE I WAN TALK TO YOU ABOUT A PROJECT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AT THE CHAMBER AND A HE SAID TIT A STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY THEY HAD PUT TOGETHER ILL TASK FOR S TO A AN AY WAY TO WORK FORCH DEVELOPMENT ISSUES BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO TOSO WAS GOING THROUGH A PRETTY EXPLOSIVE GROWTH PERIOD THE BANKER FRIEND EXPLAINED THAT LOCAL BUSINESS IS UNTILSA HAD A PROBLEM THEY WERE FINDING IT HARDER AND HARDER TO IRE EMPLOYES WITH ENOUGH SKILLS AND ABILITIES TO DO THE JOB THE CHAMBER HAD BEEN LOOKING INTO THE REASONS FOR THIS WAS AT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES NOT TRAINING PEOPLE PROPERLY HIGH SCHOOLS THEY KEPT WORKING BACK TO THIS NOTION OF CHILDREN INCREASING NUMBERS OF CHILDREN NOT BEING READY FOR SCHOOL THIS BANKER FRIEND HANDED BOB A CARDBOARD BOX FILLED WITH RESEARCH AND REPORTS ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SAID HERE LOOK THIS OVER AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO I WORKING THROUGH THIS CARDBOARD BOX OF MATERIALS IN A CUBICAL AT THE A CHAMBER THEY IN THE STAFF HAD A CUMULATED A LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT AND A I BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE A PAIRIE PRIEST SCHOOL STUDY AND DO YOU REMEMBER READING THOSE STUDIES LIKE WAS THAT SORT OF AN AHAMAMA WE ARE READING LIKE THESE LONG TERM OFFECTS OF PRIE SCHOOL WITH THAT BUT WHAT DOU REMEMML MIND AT THAT AS YOUO I TINDED TO FRAME THINGS IN TERMS OF MY A BUSINESS EXPERIENCE  AN YOU I JUST OT YEUE JUST SO AUTOMATIC HARBESON SAID HE THOUGHT BACK TO HIS CAREER IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY WHERE ONE OF THE WORST THINGS YOU CAN DO IS FLY A PLAN WITH AN EMPTY SEATE BUT A KID WHO COMES TO KINDERGARDEN TOO FAR BEHIND STATISTICALLY THAT KID MIGHT NEVER CATCH OP IS OCCUPYING THAT SEAT IND FIRST SECOND THERD GRADE AN MIDDLE SCHOOL AN HIGH SCHOOL BUT THE SEAT MIGHT AS WELL BE EMPTY FROR THE GOOD IT'S DOING THE ID SITTING IN IT AND ALSO HE THOUGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS OF WHAT HAPPENS TO A LOT OF AT RESS KIDS WHEN THEY GET OUT OF SCHOOL THEY AN OF COSTING THE GOVERNMENT A LOT OF MONEY THEY AND AV BEEN CARCERATED OR ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE BAD OUTCOMES FOR THEM AND FOR SOCIETY IALWAYS STOUGHT ABOUT IF IF IF THERE WAS A BUSINESS SOR GROUP OF BUSINESSES AND THEY HAD AGREED TO PAY FOR ALL THE OUT COMES THEY WOULD BE SPENDING MONEY ON PREVENTION THIS CARDBOARD BOX MADE A BIG IMPRESSION ON BOB HARBESON WHO IN HIS QUIET WAY BECAME SOMETHING OF A CRUSADER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION MAKING THE CASE FOR IT TO ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN INCLUDING SOME TIME IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES JOE EDONS NW MEMBER JOE WAS THIS LEGISLATOR HE HAD THIS BILL TRYING TO CLOSHE THAT LOOPHOLE AND KEEP FOUR YEAR OLDS OUT OF KINDERGARDEN BOB HARESON STARTED MAKING THE CASE THAT WE DON'T WANT FEWER FOR YEAR OLDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL WE WANT MORE OF THEM HERE'S JOE BOB HARBERSON IS EY WUT YOU KNOW HOW SMOOTH BOB HARBERSON THEIS AN E AND AD YOU KNW WHAT TO MAD I NEVER KNEW I WAS BEING LOBBY IF I WAS BEN LOY NOT IS THOB BOYIS BOB ARBERSONS TELLIN ME TWIT THINGS I MAD KNOW WHICH INCIDENALY A BOB HARBESON WAS TELLING THE TRUTH BUT TH THAT THAT WAS THE KEY THA THAT BOB HARBERSON A FOUND ME A WILLING PUPIL AND ATAUGHT ME ALL I KNOW BOUT THE FOUR YOURS  TTHEREWERE THE COURSE OF SEVERAL MEETINGS BOB SHARED WITH JOE THE CONTENTS OF THAT CARDBOARD BOX ALL THE STUDIES AND RESEARCH PROJECTS DEMONSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND JOE GRADUALLY DECIDED THAT HE NEEDED TO CHANGE HIS LOB AND MAKE IT MUCH BEAKER HE WOULD STILL ELIMINATE THAT FOUR YEAR OLDS AND KINDERGARDEN FOR CASH SKI SHIR NO LONGER COULD SCHOOLS PACK THE KINDEGERNS WITH FOUR YEAR OLDS TO GET EXTRA MONEY FROM THE STATE BUT A LONGSIDE THAT HE WOULD PROVIDE FOR AN ACTUAL PROGRAM FOR FOR YEAR OLS AND ENTIRELY NEW GRADE FULLY PAID FOR BY THE STATE PUBLIC PRIES SCHOOL AND TURNED OUT OKLAHOMA HAD A VERY GOOD PILOT PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WITH GUY LINES FOR CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE CORRICULEM AND HIRING QUALIFIED TEACHERS BUT THIS PROGRAM ONLY EXISTED IN A FEW DISTRICTS BECAUSE ACCORDING TO EDNS THE STATE DIDN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR IT EDON'S ESTIMATE THE STATE PROVIDED ONLY A THIRD OF THE MONEY THAT WAS ACTUALLY NEEDED TO RUN ONE OF THESE PROGRAMMS JOE EDON'S PLAN WAS TO TAKE THAT PILOT PROGRAMM AND FULLY FUND IT SO THAT ANY DISTRICT THAT WANTED IT COULD ACTUALLY GET PAID ENOUGH TO PUT IT IN PLACE NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROB WITH THIS PLAN TIT'S PROBABLY NO WAY IT COULD PASS NO WAY THE STATE LEGISLATURE WOULD EVER AGREE TO PAY FOR A PROGRAMMI THIS SILL JOE EDON'S ESSENTIALLY HIT IT HE SIMPLY OFFERED HIS AMENDMENT T AGAIN THE ONE CLOSING THE FOUR YEAR OLDS AND KINDRGARDEN FOR CASHLEFOLL ONLY T WITH SOME NEW LANGUAGE A KIND OF P S AND WHICH HE PROPOSED A WEEK TO THE STATES SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA MADE IT SO THAT SCHOOLS GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR PRE SCHOOL THAT THEY GOT FOR OTHER GRADES THIS WAS IN FACT A MASSIVE OVERHAUL OF OKLEHOMA'S PUBLIC SCHOOL SISTEM BUT THE ACTUAL TAX OF EDON'S AMENDMENT LOOKED LIKE NOTHING SPECIAL THE WAY YOU AMEND TO BILL A THE STAFF TAKES THE SECTIONS OF LAW THAT YOURE AMENDING AND THEN RIT YOURE AMENDMANCIN A UNDERLINE AND LINE OUT WHAT YOU ARE TELEADING LANGUAGE AND I JUST HAD A FEW WORDS HERE IN A FEW WORDS THERE STILL THERE WERE THE TRADITIONAL AND POWERFUL ENEMIES TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUDGET HAWKS AND LIMITED GOVERNMENT FOLKS WHICH AS I SAID OKLEHOMA MIGHT LEAD THE NATION IN EDINS STRATEGY HERE POLITICAL SLIGHT OF HAND HE DREW THEIR ATTENTION TO THE STUFF IN THE BILL HE THUGHT THEY WOULD LIKE AND DIDN'T MENTION THE STUFF THEY WOULDN'T I PROBABLY SAT DOWN A THIRD DESH WITH EACH REPUBLICAN AND SHOWED HIM TWO OR THREE THINGS IN THE BILL  I THOUGHT THEY OUGHT TO KNOW AND WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS WELL I SHOWED HIM WHERE IT'S A WERE E'RE KEEPING FOUR YEAR OLDS OUT OF KINDIGARDEN A WERE SAVING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY A YOU CAN CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE PROVIDERS THEY LOF THAT THAT'S ALL I SAYIN NOW EVERYTHING HE SAID WAS TRUE EDONS BILL DID ALLOW STATE MONEY TO GO TO PRIVATE DAYCARE SENTERS TO TEACH PRESCHOOL ALSO HIS PLAN WAS VOLUNTARY SCHOOL DISTRICTS DIDN'T HAVE TO OFFER PRECATE PROGRAMMS AND PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO ONE SO IT WAS ENTIRELY REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT IN THE BEGINNING AT LEAST NOT TOO MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD EVEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EDON'S TWEAK TO THE FUNDING FORMULA AND OFFER A PRECAY PROGRAMMEAND ONE OTHER THING EDONS HAD GOING FOR HIM THIS FOUR YEAR OLD AND KINDR GAREN FOR CASHSCHEME IT WAS GROWING AND WAS FEARED THAT THE TWO BIGGEST DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OKLEHOMA CITY AND TULSA WERE ABOUT TO GET IN ON IT EDON SAYS THAT COMPARED TO THE SURE FINANSIAL ARMAGEDAN THAT WOULD BE HIS BILL WAS THE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE EVERY BODY COULD SEE THAT MY BILL WAS WAY CHEAPER THAN NOT MY BILL IF YOU VOTED NO ON MY BILL AND KILLED IT YOU WERE GOING O HAVE ENORMOUS IN ROMAN A FOUR YEAR OLD SAN KINDIGARDEN AND THIS WAS TAKING AN EMENSE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND A ALL BUT ONE VOTED YES ON THE BILL PROBABLY BECAUSE IN ALMOST ALL HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH LAWMAKERS ABOUT HIS BILL EDONS LEFT OUT THE MAIN PART YOU KNOW THE PART ABOUT HOW HE PUT THE STATE ON THE HOOK TO PAY FOR AN ENTIRELY NEW GRAT LOVEL HE KNEW ALMOST NOBODY IN ANY LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY READS ALL THE BILLS AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD OKLEHOMA'S SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA YOU COULD PY COUNT ON ONE HAND AND HIS STRAGEGY WORKED IT WAS A HUGE AND COSTLY EXPANSION OF THE GOVERNMENTS ROLL AND PUBLIC EDUCATION IN A STATE MOREIPOSED TO COSTLEY EXPANSIONS OF GOVERNMENT THAN PERHAPS ANY OTHER IN THE COUNTRY STEPHEN DOW WAS THE DIRECTOR OF AN ANTI POVERTY AGENCY AND A LONG TIME EARLY CHILDHOOD EGDUCATION ADVOCATE IN O KLOHOMA HE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH JOEDONS TO GET THIS LAW WRITTEN IN PASSED I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING ON IN TERMS OF THE ADJOSTOMENT TO THE STATE ADE FORMUA THAT MOST CERTAINLY YOU COULD YOU COULD COUNT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE WERE OF THAT ON ONE HAND NOW IF THERE HAD BEEN IF EVERYBODY IN THE STATE WAS AWARE OF IT WOUT IT HAVE PASSED I I I DON' UKNOW THAT I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IT'S LIKELY THAT IT WOULD HAVE PASSED BASICALLY IF IF YOU GOT SADN'T NUCK  FISION I WOULD SAY AD AD THE FING HAD HAD THE ENACTMENT OF TUNIVERSAL PREK I'T NOT BEEN DONE THROUGH THIS WHAT I WOULD CALL STEALTH CAMPAIGN AI THINK IT'S FAIRER TO SAY THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EMBRACE  THE IRONY IS NOW THAT THE LAW IS AND PLACE NOKLOHOMA IT JUST ADDS EVIDENCE TO THE CASE FOR PRESCHOOL RESEARCHERS WHO STUDIED TULSAS PRESCHOOL KIDS SAY THEY EN TER KINDO GARDEN AND AVERAGE OF FIVE MONTHS AHEAD AND MAT SEVEN MONTHS AHEAD IN WRITING AND NINE MONTHS AHEAD IN REATING AND THE GAMES ARE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED FOR ATRIS KIDS WHO GET PRESCHOOL LOYDS KNOW THE OKLHOM SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT SAYS HE DIDN'T E A STUDY TO SHOW HIM THAT HE COULD SEE AT THE VERY NEXT YEAR AFTER I DISTRICT STARTED OFF FROM PEE SCHOL I MEAN ONE YEAR AFTER WE STARTED I MEAN WE HAD HAVE DEPARTMENT MEETINGS NO KINCIOF TEPICAUS OUR KIDS YOU'LL HAVE BETTER TWARD RECOGNITION LETTER RECOGNITION BETTER SO SIA SKILLES BETTER A A AND I CORDINATION SKILES BETTER A A YO JUST ALMOST A BETTER EVERYTHING AAS IT RELATES TO REDYI FOR SCHOOL SO NOW WE'VE GOT ALL OF OUR KIDS FOR WHATEVER BAT GRAM I MEAN THEIR VORACIOUS MURNERS NAM DO STORT ME WITH THAT STOP SO NO MADBE SEES I KNO AH YE YEH YES SO SO THAT WAS CUT OF A GAME CHANGER FOR FORN FOR FOR US NOTHING OTE TA MOST SCHOOLS A GAME CHANGE OF THAT ACCORDING TO JO EDONS THE LEGISLATOR WHO ARGUABLY DID MORE TO CHANGE THE GAME THAN ANYONE ELSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STRANGE FOUR YEAR OLDS AN KUNER GARDEN FOR CASH SCHEME THE SCHEME THAT EDDONS USED AS A SMOKESREENE TO SNEAK UNIVERSAL PREQ THROUGH A SCEPTICAL LEGISLATURE I DON'T SEE IT EVER A BEING FUN DID IF YOU HAD  LIKE OTHER STATES DO IF YOU HAD TO SAY HERE'S A PROGRAMME THAT WE WON'T A IMPLEMENT A HERE'S HOW MUCH MONEY IT'LL TAKE WHO WERE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY I YOU KNOW IF YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LINE ITEM APPROPRIATION  NOBODY WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED IT EXCEPT THE YOUNG MOTHERS AND THEY HAVE NO POLITICAL CLOUT WHAT LESSONS COULD OTHER STATES SAY OTHER STATES WONT TAT TRY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS PRAYER THEY DON'T HAVE A PRAYER THEY DON'T HAVE A PRAYER A BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIE AND THERE'S A THE STATE LEGISLATURS ARE RUN BY PEOPLE THAT DON'T WON'T A S THEY WON'T A CUT PROGRAMMES NOT IAD PROGRAMES NOT EVERYONE WOULD AGREE WITH EDNS ON THIS IN FACT IF YOU TALK TO EXPERTS THE TRANND AROUND THE COUNTRY AS FOR MORE AND MORE KIDS TO BE ENROLLED IN STATE FON TE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMMS  STATES AS DIVERSES GEORGIA I WA OR MONT AND WEST VIRGINIA ARE ALL HARD ON THE HEELS OF OKLOHAMA WITH PRESCHOOL PROGRAMMES OF THEIR OWN AND AS FOR OKLOHAMA PARENTS SAYS LOYDS KNOW OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT THEY LOVE THIS SCPROGRAMM ANDSTATISTICS ACROSS THE STATE BEAR THAT OUT REMEMBER PARNTS TON HALF TER CENT THE KIS THE PRESCHOL IT'S VOLUNTARY BUT ALMOST SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE STATES FOUR YEAR OLD ARE NOW ENROLLED IN PUBLIC PRESCHOOL HOWEVER IT ARRIVED IT SEEMS THAT UNIVERSAL PREQ IS HERE TO STAY IN OKLOHOMA WHO OUG SPIMBURG HE'S THE FOUNDER OF GIMWAT MEDIA IN

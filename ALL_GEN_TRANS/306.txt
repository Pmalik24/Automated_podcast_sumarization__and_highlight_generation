ASTATOR GETTING  HUGE MOUNTS OF BLOOD WAS COMING OUT AND A I'D THIS WHITE TEA SHERDER WAS EVENTUALLY OLL IN BLOOD NOW THERE WAS REALLY THE WAY OFF THE ISLAND EVEN BY SWIMMING BECAUSE WILLYOU KNOW SHARKS IT WAS A GALLING SITUATION AND IT WAS MADE EVEN MORE MAD CAUSE THE CITY WAS RIGHT THERE I WAS LIKE THINKING HOWN THE HELL THAT I GET MYSELF INTO THE SITUATION I I NEVER BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN IN  LIKE IN NEW YORK CITY AN LIKE IS SUCH A HUGE CITY THAT YOU COULD SEE SKY O SKY SCRAPERS LIKE TEN MILES AWAY AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU CAN DIE LOOKING AT THEM YOU KNOW IAND ALSO I GOT A LITTLE MAD AT THE CITY OF NEW YORK LIKE I COULDNT I COULD UNDERSTAND IF THEY HAD JUST ONE PAY FROM THERE OR AT LEAST I DON'T KNOW LIKE A BUTTON TO PRESS TOTO KNOW THAT YOU'RE THERE YOU

HOW DID YOU CATCH TH DUCK OH IM ER YOU JUST GO AFTER IT WITH A STICK I MEAN YOUR HUMAN BEING YOUET MORE BRAINS THAN A DUCK YOU CAN CATCH  BUT I WASN'T REALLY THINKING ABOUT DOING IT I WASN'T LIKE

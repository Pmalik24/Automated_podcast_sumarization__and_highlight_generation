EIHT OR HAN ANY NOW PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER INVISIBILITY ALWAYS ONE ANOW DO I HAVE TO BE NAKED PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE FLIGHT ONE ANOW HOW FAST ALMOST ALL ASKED WHO UD BEEN IN A FIGHT MISTER INVISIBLE OR FLYING MAN AND SO I HAD TO LAY DOWN SOME RULES IN VISIBILITY MEANS THE POWER TO BECOME TRANSPARENT A WILL INCLUDING YOUR CLOTHING BUT ANYTHING YOU MAY PICK UP IS VISIBLE FLIGHT MEANS THE POWER TO FLY AT ANY ALTITUDE WITHIN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE AT SPEEDS UP TO ONE THOUSAND MILES PR HOWER BUT EVEN THEN THEY START LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES HIDDEN CATCHES SUPERPOWER FINE PRINT THEY START NEGOTIATING THEIR

CARRY SOMEBODY CAN SOMEBODY GON ON OON MY BACK CAN YOU CARRY SOMEONE ON YOUR BACK NOW A LITTLE PEOPLE YOU LITTLE PEOPLE Y THAN YOU CAN CARRY LITTLE PEOPLE UN ER BAY DONE FLIGHT IT IS THIS IS ALL PART OF WHAT I CALL THE FIVE STAGES OF CHOOSING YOUR SUPER POWER SOMETIMES THIS PROSESS OCCURS AND JUST MOMENTS FOR EXAMPLE SUBJEC A TOLISH MAN ITH GLASSES LEDGED INTO A CRAMPED FARROM CORNER BEGINS AS THEY ALL DO WITH STAGE ONE CAT REACTION INDISTIUALLY HAV WA THANK CAV PERHAPS IN VISIBILITY NEXT COME STAGE TO PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE BILITY TYOU Y WALK AROUND WORK PERHAPS SHOW UP AT ONE POINT AND PERHAPS I GO AWAY FOR LITLE WHI TURN INVISIBLE AND THEN COME BACK OF THIS I N WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YOU YET THE POWER TO SPY ON YOUR ACSIS AND NOW IT A'LL BE ENLIGHTENING AND AND FINE AND IN FACK A LIT IT PERVERTED AND AM YOU HEAR THAT DOUT IN HIS VOICE THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF STAE THREE PHILOSOTICAL RE CONSIDERATION AT WOULD I BELIEVE IU BE YOU WOULD YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY TURN INTO A LIFE OF COMPLETE DEPRESSION YOU WOULD YOU WOULD GET TO REALLY SHARE WITH ANY ON YOU NOW AM AND I KNOW THER BE SOME LIK FROM IT LIKE THE AT THE EFIRS OF THANK STAGE FOR SELF  FROM AN ANTION IN VISIBILITY TEASES YOU AV THES ME AS IN VISILE PERSON TOWN A OUR CAS ECAUSE YOURE NOT GOON  MISS OUT EN YOUR VISIBLE ON OU NOW TO MATTER HOW MANY TIME YOU SEEN O WOMAN MAKIN IN A SHOWER YOURE GOTTE WANT O SEE IT A GAIN BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS A DIFFERE WOMN A  AN THERE'S LIKE A LIGHE TIME A THAN AND THAT THAT'S NOT EXCEPT ABLE BE GAVOU NO MATTER WHETHER YOUR VISIBILE AN NON AND FINELY STAGE FON EXCEPT ANCE YAD AV BUT FLIGHT SO WHO CHOOSEIS INVISIBILITY AND WHO CHOOSES FLY IN MY EXPERIENCE THOUGH THERR LOTS OF EXCEPTIONS MENDLING TOWARD FLYING WOMENTO INVISIBILITY AND MANY BREWD ANXIOUSLY OVER THEIR CHOICE SWITCHING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND BACK AGAIN AND THAT'S BECAUSE MORE THAN THE ABILITY SAY TO BURST INTO FLAME OR SHOOT ARROWS WITH UNCANNY ACCURACY FLIGHTEN IN VISIBILITY TOUCH AN NERVE ACTUALLY THEY TOUCHED TOO DIFFERENT NERVES SPEAK TO VERY DIFFERENT PRIMAL DESIRES AND UNCONSCIOUS FEARS MY FRIEND CRISTINE CHOSEIN VISIBILITY WHAT IF TA POWER IS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUS N THE OTHER IS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS HIDDEN AN INDICATES YOUR LEVELOP SHAME HOW DO YOU MEAN A PRESENT HICHES IS TO FLY HAS TOTHING TO HIDE A PERSONAGE IS O BE INVISIBLE WANTS CLEARLY TO HIDE THEMSELVES DO YOU FEEL THATYOU WANL HIDE YOURSELF I WANT TO A I'D LIKE TO NOT  TITS THAT QUESTN IT ALL THIS TA DE WIN GUILE  WANTING TO BE INVISIBLE ME INS THAT YOU ARE MORE GUILE FULL PERSON IF YOU WANT TO FLY IT MAS YOUR GUILELESS I THINK THE REASON THAT I AM SO CONFLICTED ABOUT MYING VERSIS INVISIBILITY IS IT A HAD GUILE BUT I REALLY WISH THAT I DIDN'T FLIGHT OS THE HERO SELPLESS AND CONFIDENT AND UNASHAMED AN INVISIBILITY THE VILAIN ALMOST EVERY ONE I TALK TO CALLED INVISIBILITY THE SNEAKIER POWER FLYING AS FOR PEOPLE L YOU WANT TO LET IT ALL ING AT IN IT ISABILITY IS FOR FEARFUL CROUCHING MASTER BERS FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GET TO TELL YOU THAT THEY WOULD CHOOSE FLIGHT AND I THINK THEYRE LYING TO YOU I THINK THEY'R SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEY TRY TO SOUND ALL MYTHIC AND HEROIC BECAUSE THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE WOULD TELL US THAT THE REAL THING THAT WE SHOULD STRIVE FOR IS FLIGHT AND THAT THAT'S NOBLE AN ALL THAT CAN STUFF BUT I THINK ACTUALLY IF EVERYBODY WERE BEING PERFECTLY ON US WITH THOU THEY WOULD TELL OU THE TRUTH WHICH IS THAT THEY ALL WANT TO BE INVISIBLE SO THAT THEY CAN SHOP LIFT GET NTO MOLIES FOR FREE GO TO EXCOTIC PLACES ON AIR PLACE WITHOUT PAYING FOR AIR LINE TICKETS AND WATCH CELEBRITIES HAVE SEX AT ANY ONE FACE WITH THIS CHOICE IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS WUT CHOOSEIN VISIBILITY YES OR THEY HAVE THE A SORT OF INFLATED HEROIC MYTHICAL CONCEPT OF THEMSELVES AND DA THAT INFECT THEY'RE NOT REALLY GIVING DURING WHICH BREHE  TOT  N  YOU MHEND IS NOT IC QUESTION OF WHAT KIND OF PERSON FLIES AND WHAT KIND OF PERSON FATES WE ALL DO BOTH PERHAPS THAT'S WHY WHEN I PUT THE CHOICE TO MYSELF AN HOPELESSLY COMPLETELY STUFF THE HEART OF THIS DECISION THE QUESTION I REALLY DON'T ONE OF THINGS IS THIS WHO D YOU WANT TO BE PERSON YOU HOPE TO BE  THE PERSON YOU FEAR YOU ACTUALLY ARE DON'T RUSSIAN TO IT THINK IT OVER WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE  A GMEN S HE OTHER OF MANY FINE BOOKS WAS LATEST IS CALLED VACATION LAND TRUE STORYS FROM

POWERS TO COMMUNICATE IN CONTROUL THE ANIMALS WY THIS ONE THING THAT PRESS PROVES IT'S THAT THA THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE PRESIDENT CONSOLVED WITH TWO FIFTS AND ANYIN COMPANION AND A SMALL ARMY OF BIRDS AND EL  IF YOU WERE TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A BAD COMIC BOOK SUPERHEREOUT THERE ARE A YATHER OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF WAYS YOU CAN SCREW UP IM ONE OF THE WAYS IS TO JUST OVERDO IT AND AND CRAM THE THE ELEMENTS THE CHARACTER DOWN THE READER'S THROATS A ONE O THE THE CHARACTERS WAS B MN AND EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS BEES HIS FULL NAME WAS BERY E EMS A HE WAS ATTACKED BY MUTINT BEES WHICH WERE SENT TO EARTH BY SPACE ALIEN B PEOPLE AND HE HIMSELF BECAME A MUTINT B PERSON WHO HAD BE POWERS AND LIVED IN A HIVE AND EAT HONEY AND STOLE GOLD BECAUSE GOLD LOOKED LIKE HONEY AND HE COULD STING YOU THERE IS NOTHING BE RELATED THIS MAN REFUSED TO DO IT'S IF YOU YOU YOU MEET SOMEBODY AT A BAR YOU START TALKING TO M YOU REALIZE HE ONLY HAS ONE INTEREST IN LIVE THAT'S EXACTLY WOULD BEVERYTHING WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BACK TO BEES YOU STRARK TIME BY WHIC YO WATCH ON TELLIWICH ON LAST NIHTILL SAY YOU NOTT SUN INTERESTING YO ONE BES A AA A A AHE SERIM COMIC SUPERHERE AS COME OUT OF PARTICULAR A MOMENTS IN THE NATION'S HISTORY POSITIVELY I THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT THAT REALLY WORKS AGAINST A CHARACTERS WHEN THEIR TIED IN TOO TIGHTLY TO A FAD OR A TIHT IN TOO TIGELY TO SOMETHING THAT IS IDENTIFYING AN AIRA THERE'S A CHARACTER CREATED IN THE SEVENTIES BUT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE RETRO CHARACTER FROM THE FIFTIES NAME OF THREE D MAN TO HELP HOOK UP ON THE THREEDY MOVIES THERE WERE A CRAZE IN THE FIFTIES TERRIBLE FLAT CHARACTER NOTHING GOING ON AND WHEN YOU SAY THREE DEEMAN WHAT WAS HIS POWER H A AD A A MATRICAL PAIR OF GLASSES AND I HAVE THE STRENGTH OF THREE MAN AND THAT'S IT HE WAS AS STRONG AS THREE PEOPLE FAST AS THREE PEOPLE WHATEVER THAT MEANS PROLY THREE TIMES FASTER THAT HUMAN BING I THEY ALWAYS DESTRABE IS SO AS SOMETHING AS SO MUCH AS THREE MEN BUT I DON'T SEE HE CAN BE THREE TIMES AS BE THE HAVE THE AGILITY OF THREE MEN T THEY THIS THREE GIES WERE ASUAL AS MAKE ANY SENSE HII HAVE LITTLE TROUBLE OF THREEDING PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE WITH JUST NAMING OFF THE SUPERHEROES ARE GOINGTROUGH THEIR POWERS IS THAT ON THE FACE VALUE THERE IS NOT A SUPERHEE WHO DOESN'T SEEM SILLY A BECAUSE HE HAVE TO DD TO A POINT WHERE THE MAN'S WEARING A COSTRUUM AND HE'S DRIVING ROUND FIGHTING CRIME AND THEN WHERE IT IES THE LINE COMWAY THEY RISE ABOVE THAT DO YOU HAVE AE THEORY ON THIS ABOUT WHAT MAKES A GOOD ONE IN A BAD ONE I HAVE SORT OF A HALF FORMED THEORY I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY A HELPS THE SUPERPOWER TO GET OVER WITH THE AUDIENCE GET OVER WITH THE READERS IS A IF IT' SOMETHING THEY CAN APPLY TO THEIR NORMAL LIVES PERHAPS BY WAY OF FANTASY AND THAT'S I THINK WHY SUPERSTRENGTH  SUPERSPEED A IF VONER ABILITY URGES GENERAL TOUGHNESS ARE OFTEN SO COMMON YOUAN GET ON THE COURT WITH IT GET THAT SUPERACCURACY AND GET A SLAMM DOG FROM MID COURTS AND AND REALLY JUST SCHOOL OVER SOMEBODY THAND THAT'S HARILY A SUPERPAWER YOU WANT A YOU KNOW BUT WHEN YOU START GETTING INTO POWERS LIKE AM ONE CARAC TO WHO HAD MAGNETIC EYES OF SUPERPOWER

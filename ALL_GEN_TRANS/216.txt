VERY FIRST DAY OF IN PERSON LEARNING HE SAS HE LINGERED BY HIS TEACHERS DESK AFTER CLASS HUNG BACK AND I WAS JUST LIKE HEY OWN I THING I SAID MY NAME FINN NOW AND I SEE HIM FRONCE AND SHESJUS LIKE OH IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE SHE WAS LIKE DIS GUSTED HER THIN SEEM LIKE SHE WAN TO DO THAT SHE SHE JUST SEEME TO MORE SHOCKED I DON'T THINK SHE'S EVER LIKE ENCOUNTERDAY AT THIS POINT AGAIN THIS IS THE SPRING OF FINS AITH GREAT YEAR TRINCE GIDS WERE NOT YET CONSTANTLY IN THE HEADLINES AND FNN SAYS MOST OF HIS TEACHERS WERE OPEN AND SWEET WITH HIM VERY EXCEPTING AND UNDERSTANDING AND DI JERT SO BEYOR TEACHERS GOOD ABOUT USING THE RIT PRONOUNCE EVERYTHING FOR THE MOST PART I I MEAN IT TAKES ANY ONE AR COUPLE MINUTES PRONONS ARE NOT A SMALL THING FOR FIN WHEN PEOPLE REFER TO HIM WITH THE WRONG PRORNAN HE SAYS IT SO DISTRESSING HEU OFTEN FEELS PHYSICALLY ILL IT'S A RESPONSE THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON SOMETIME IT SLAKE E PAIN AND MINT GET IM SOMETIMES I ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO BOU SOMETIMES A JUST AFTER WALKAWAY NATURALLY MAKE SURE I DON'T BUT QUEESINESS WASN'T MUCH OF A PROBLEM IN MIDDLE SCHOOL FEN REMEMBERS TELLING HIS FRIENDS FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HE WANTED TO GO BY HE  THING THEY LIKE THREANS IF ANYONE MUST UP THEY'D PUNCTION I DON'T SPHYCICALLY REMEMBER BUT I THINK THAT WAS ONE IN THEIR RACTIONS HEIN MADE ME LAUGH AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WENT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR THE TEACHERS WERE OPEN THE KIDS WERE ON BOARD AND IT MAY FIN GRADUATED FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL FEELING GOOD COMFORTABLE FINN'S PARENTS JOSHIN JODY WERE INCREDIBLY RELIEVE THEY'VE LIVED IN GROVE HILL FOR MOST OF THEIR LIVES AND SO HAVE A NEW ANTS TO VIEW OF THE COMMUNITY ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS THAT GROVHILLE ALABAMA CONTAINS JODY TOLD ME THAT THOUGH MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS SEEMED COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT TO WHETHER FINN WAS TRANS OR NOT AND LOVED HIM NO MATTER WHAD MAYBE EVEN MORE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY FIND THE EXPERIENCE OF HER CHILD DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND EVEN HIS EXISTENCE UNSETTLING WHICH BRINGS ME TO HIGH SCHOOL THIS IS FINNS MAM JODY TWO DAYS BEFORE SCHOOL ACTUALLY STARTED HE SAID WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO YOU IF I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATH M AT SCHOOL AND I I GUESS SAY WA S NI EVE BECAUSE IT STILLDID CLICK I WAS LIKE WHAT YOU MEAN I YE HAVE TO GO THE BATH ROOM GETTO THE BATH E YE WT WIT I SOY STUPID NOW AND HE SAID NO WHICH WANT OM I SUPPOSED TO USE IT DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE GIRLS ROOM NOW THERE WERE NO LAWS DICTATING WHEREFINN COULD GO TO THE BATHROOM NOT YET ANYWAY SO WHEN JODY TALKED WITH THE SCHOOL PRINCIPLE ABOUT WHAT FINN SHOULD DO THE PRINCIPAL QUICKLY CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION FINN COULD USE THE SINGLE STALL BATHROOM IN THE TEACHERS LOUNGE THIS SUITED HIM FINE AND FINN SAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF SCHOOL HE WAS FEELING RELATIVELY OPTO MISTIC AND WASN'T AS WORRIED WITH MY NAMES ER PRONOUNCE MORE THAN I WAS FINDING MY WOCKER IN FINDING  THE GLASSES BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FINN ENCOUNTERED PUSH BACK IT STARTED IN GEOMETRY CLASS TEACHER WAS CALLING ROLL AND I TRY GOING UP TO THEM WHILE THEY'RE DOING IT SO THEY WON'T CALL OUT MY DED NAME IM BUT SHE TOLD ME TO SIT DOWN AND SHE'S CALLED ON MY NAME AND WHEN SHE WALKED UP TO ME I CORRECTED HER I TELL HER THAT THAT'S NOT MY NAME AND I USE A DIFFERENT NAME AND PRONOUNCE AND SHE WAS LIKE NO I'M NOT GING TO DO THAT I'M GOINGTO GO OFF WHAT'S ON THE PAPER AND WHAT DID YOU SAY NOTHING AND IT WASN'T JUST THE GEOMETRY TEACHER THERE WAS PUSHPECT FROM FINS ENGLISH TEACHER HIS SCIENCE TEACHER EVEN HIS HISTORY AND HOBBY'S TEACHER SHE PULL ME ASIDE AND SHE TOLD ME THAT ON SHE RESPECTS KIDS AND SHE LOVES KIDS AND ALL THAT IS WHY SHE BECAME A TEACHER IN WHATEVER IM SHE'LL DO THE NAME BY ULSHE WON'T DO THE PRONOUN BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I BELIEVE IN I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT I'LL JUST NOT CALL ON YOU ANIT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE EXACT WY BEHIND THIS RE SISTENS I REACHEDAT TOFIN'S TEACHERS THE SCHOOL PRINCIPLE THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE ALL EITHER DECLINED TO TALK TO ME WERE DIDN' RESPON BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE NATIONAL CONVERSACHION WAS CHANGING AND GROWING THERE WERE MORE AND MORE BILLS DIREC TO TO TRAN'S KIDS WREGULATING HOW THEY PLAYD SPORTS WHERE THEY WENT TO THE BATHROOM WHAT KIND OF MEDICAL CARE THEY COUL GET ACCESS TO SOMETIMES FORBIDDING ANY DISCUSSION OF TRANSISSUES IN SCHOOL AT ALL DID THAT INFLUENCE THIS RESPONSE WAS IT SIMPLY TEACHER LUCK OF THE DRAW OFTEN KNEW WAS THAT VERY VERY UNFORTUNATELY THE FEELINGS OF THE TEACHERS SEEMED TO BE SPREADING LIKE TALKING TO ME SAYING THE WRONG CRONOUNCS IT AFFECTED HOW OTHER PEOPLE SAW SAW ME BUT SLOWLY ANYWAY WHAT HOU MEAN SLOWLY INTAWOY IT WAS MORE GRADUALLY OBVIOUS TAT PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS A GIRL IT WAS A ROUND DESEMBER OF HIS FRESHMANYERE THAT FINN BEGAN TO THINK MORE SERIOUSLY ABOUT MEDICAL TRANSESSION FINDING A DOCTOR WHO COULD PROFIED HORMON BLOCKERS AN EVENTUALLY TESTOSSED HER OWN FINN THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP PEOPLE TO SEE HIM THE RIGHT WAY VERY INSECURE BOON'T LIKE HOW HI MY VOICE CAN GO OH SO WAS LIKE IF I WAS ABLE TO ACCESSESS A AND PROBLY HELWHEN FINN TALKED TO JODY ABOUT GETTING TREATMENT HORMON BLOCKERS IN TESTOSSE HER OWN SHE TOLD HIM SHE WAS OPEN TO THE IDEA BUT NEEDED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS SAFE FIRST SHE SAID SHE'D RESEARCH IT SO FINN PLOUGHED FORWARD PLAYED HIM BEYOND SUFFERED THREUGH GEOMETRY AND ALSO BECAME INCREASINGLY DISTRESS WORRIED THAT HIS TEACHERS WOULD CONTINUE TO MISGENDER HIM THAT THE KIDS AT SCHOOL WOULD CONTINUE TO QUESTION WHETHER HE WAS TRULY ABOY THAT IT WOULD ALL JUST KEEP ON GETTING WORSE AND THEN ONE DAY IN GEOMETRY FINN HAD A BREAKING POINT SHE EITHER AND NAME TO ME MISS GENDERED ME ONE OF THE OTHER IN FRONT OF THE GLASS AND AND SHE BESSED OUT A TESTPAPER AND O MY PAPERS I USUALLY WRITE FIN HE HIM JUST LIKE A LITTLE REMINDER NO AND I DID THAT AFTER WRITING THAT I WROTE IT IT WAS

REALLYGON A COMMIT SOI SIDE OF THE TEAC HER DIDN'T USE THE RIGHT PRONOUNCE HE JUST COULDN'T THINK OF ANOTHER WAY TO COMMUNICATE HIS DISTRESS THE PROBLEM OF SUICIDE IS INCREDIBLY SERIOUS AMONG TRANS KIDS A RECENT STUDY SHOWD THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ROUGHLY ONE IN TWO TRANS U SERIOUSLY CONSIDERS SUICIDE THAT WHEN PARENTS AND SCHOOLS ARE ACCEPTING THE RATE OF ACTUAL SOASIDE ATTEMPTS FALLS DRAMATICALLY FINN'S BOMJODY DID TALK TO THE TEACHER ABOUT THIS NOT AND SHE SAYS THAT SHE WALKED AWAY FROM THE CONVERSATION FEELING AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT BETTER SHE TOLD ME SHE COULD SEE THE TEACHER CARED FOR FIN BUT FELT LIKE USING HIS RIHT NAME IN PRONOUNCS WAS AGAINST HER RELIGION SHE WASN'T AT ALL A BRACE OF WITH ME SHE DIDN'T TENSE WHEN I BROUGHT ANYTHING UP OM SHE ACTUALLY SHE CRIED WHEN I

POLITICS OT THIS PLAN THAT IS WHY IS IT THAT ON CAMPAS THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LIKE QUEERS FOR PALISTINE WHERE IS THAT COMING FROM THEY HATE AMERICA AND THEY HATE THE WEST THAT IS THE COMMON THREAD UNITING RADICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH TERRORIST MEMBERS OF COMOSS IT'S WHY WE SEE MARCHES BY QUEERS FOR PALISTINE DESPITE THE FACT THAT QUEERS WOULD BE SUMMARILY MURDERED IN ANY PALISTINE THEI'R DIFFERENCE IS DON'T MATTER THEY ARE IN THE WORDS OF RADICAL REVOLUTIONARY OUTHOR FHRONSFINON THE WRETCHED OF THE EARTH RISING UP TO SMITE THE HIERARCHIES OF POWER IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE FRONZSFANT ON A BLACK RADICAL MEMBER OF THE ALJEURIAN NATIONAL ABRATION FRONT PUT FORTH A SHOCKINGLY VIOLENT TREATIS CALLING FOR THE REVOLUTION OF THE COLONIZED POINTING OUT THE EVILS OF COLONIAL AD MINISTRATION PHANONTON MERELY CALLED FOR AN END TWO COLONIALISM LA GONDY INSTEAD HE CALLED FOR VIOLENS WHICH HE SIZED PURIFYING IN ALL OF ITS VARIED FORMS HIS BOOK THE WRETCHED OF THE EARTH POSITED THAT REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE WOULD USHER IN THE NEW MAN FREE OF THE EVILS OF THE WEST DECOLONIZATION HE WROTE IS ALWAYS A VIOLENT OMEND DE COLONIZATION HE WROTE WHICH SETS OUT TO CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE WORLD IS CLETRLY IN AGENDA FOR TOTAL DISORDER IN ITS BEREALITY FENONWROTE DE COLONIZATION REEKS OF RED HOT CANNONBALLS AND BLOODY KNIVES VIOLENCE DISORDER BLOODY KNIVE THAT'S THE ESSENSE A FINON'S DECOLONIZATION THE COLONIZE MUST TAKE EVERYTHING FROM THE COLONIZERS IN THE NAME OF RESTORING HIMSELF AS A HUMAN BEING FINAL RIGHTS QUOTE THE GAZE THAT THE COLONIZED SUBJECT CASTS AT THE COLONISTS SECTOR IS A LOOK OF LUST A LOOK OF ENVY DREAMS OF POSSESSION EVERY TYPE OF POSSESSION OF SITTING AT THE COLONIST'S TABLE AND SLEEPING IN HIS BED PREFERABLY WITH HIS WIFE THE COLONIZED MAN IS AN ENVIOUS MAN COLONIALISM HE SAYS JUSTIFIE ANY RESPONS IN FACT IT REQUIRES ANY RESPONSE THE WEST MUST BE DESTROYED FOR THE WEST HAS COLONIZE QUOTE WHEN THE COLONIZED YOUR SPEECH ON WESTERN CULTURE THEY DRAW THE MICHETTIS OR AT LEASE CHECKED TO SEE THEY ARE CLOSE AT HAND FANON SAYS SACHATER OF COLONIAL POWER WAS AT LEASET SOMEWHAT UNDERSTANDBL IND ALGERIA BUT FENON WASN'T MAKING THE CASE FOR REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE MERELY IN ALGERIA HE'S ACTION MAKING THE CASE FOR REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE THE PERSON WHO MADE THAT CLEAR WAS EXISTENTIALIST AND MARKIST JOHN PULSARTR THE FRENCHINT ELECTUAL SRTAR'S INTRODUCTIONS O FINONS WRETCHED OF THE EARTH MAKES THE CASE NOT ONLY THAT THE COLONIZE HAVE AN ULTIMATE RIGHTS VIOLENCE BUT THAT THE ENTIRE WEST MUST BE COLLAPSED FROM WITHIN FOR ITS GREAT SINS VIOLENCE SAYS SARTRA QUOTE IS MAN RECONSTRUCTING HIMSELF KILLING A EUROPEAN IS KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE ELIMINATING IN ONE GO OPPRESSER AND OPPREST LEAVING ONE MAN DEAD AND THE OTHER MAN FREE THE ONLY HONORABLE THING FOR THE WEST TO DO IS DROIN IN ON ITS CULTURAL SUICIDE QUOTE YOU WHO ARE SO LIBERAL SO HUMAN WHO TAKE THE LOVE OF CULTURE TO THE POINT OF AFFECTATION YOU PRETEND TO FORGET THAT YOU HAVE COLONIES WHERE MASSACRES ARE COMMITTED IN YOUR NAME SARTRA WRIGHTS FINON REVEALS TO HIS COMRADES ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO REMAIN A LITTLE TOO WESTERNIZED THE SOLIDARITY OF THE METROPOLITANS WITH THEIRE COLONIAL ATIONS SARTRA SAYS THAT HE HAS CARRIED FANONS QUOTE DIALECTIC THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION WE TOO PEOPLES OF EUROPE WE ARE BEING DECOLONIZED MEANING THE COLONIST INSIDE EVERY ONE OF US IS SURGICALLY EXTRACTED IN A BLOODY OPERATION WE MUST ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE COMPLICIT IN QUOTE A ONE THOUSAND YEAR OLD OPRESSION OUR BELOVED VALUES ARE LOSING THEIR FEATURES IF YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK THEREIS NOT ONE THAT IS IN TAINTED WITH BLOOD SO HOW DO WE RECOVER BY JOINING IN ON THE VIOLENCE AGAINST OUR OWN CIVILIZATION VIOLENCE SAYS SARTRA LIKE A KHILLEE'S SPEAR CAN HEAL THE WOUNDS IT HAS INFLICTEN SO WHO CAN WE TELL WHO ARE ENEMIES ARE WELL WE SIMPLY ATTACK THE POWERFUL THE COLONIZERS ARE THE POWERFUL THE COLONIZE ARE THE POWERLESS THEREFORE THE POWERFUL MUST BE COLONIZERS AND THE POWERLESS THEIR VICTIMS THIS IS SARTRA'S LOGIC THIS IS FOR EXAMPLE HOW ISRAEL THE ULTIMATE CASE OF DECOLONIZATION A CROSS HUMAN HISTORY AFTER THE TURN OF A NATIVE POPULATION TO ITS HOMELAND AND IT'S BATTLE TO THROW OFF THE SHACKALS OF THE BRITISH MANDATE BE CAME TODAY'S HOTTESED QUOTE DECOLONIZATION CAUSE SARTRA'S RADICAL CALL HAS BEEN TAKEN UP SPERATICALY BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD AS CRITICAL THERISTS HOME BABA POINTS OUT IN HIS FORWARD TO FNAL'S BOOK THE BLACK PANTHERS FOUND INSPIRATION IN FENON SO DID TH ARRONIAN REVOLUTIONARIES WHO ENDED WITH THE RISE OF THE MULLAS THOSE REVOLUTIONARIES TRANSMUTED FINOL'S DISTINCTION BETWEEN OPPRESSER AND OPPREST INTO A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ARROGANT AND THE WEAKEN TRANSLATING FINONCE MARKSIST TINGED RADICALISM INTO RADICAL ISLAMISM BUT THE COALITION OF FINOL'S WRETCHERD OF THE EARTH COULD NOT MATERIALIZE UNTIL THE GENERATION OF SARTRA CAME TO FUL MATURITY UNTIL THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE WEST POISONED THEMSELVES SLOWLY WITH THE IMBACILIC TOICIDALITY OF WEAKNESS THE WEST REMAIN STRONG ENOUGH TO FEND OFF THE RADICAO LINES WHEN IT FACE DOWN T SOVIA UNION BUT THEN IT COULDN'T STND UP FOR ITSELF AND SO I BEGAN TO FALL FAST FORD SIXTY YEARS FROM SARTRA AND SARTAR'S RADICALISM HAS NOW BECOME A MASS MOVEMENT A MOVEMENT UNITING CAMMAS AND CAMPUS RADICALS THE FAR LEFT AND THE TERRORIS CORNAL WEST THE BLACK MARKSIS RADICAL CALLS FINONCUALT THE GREATEST REVOLUTIONARY INTELLECTUAL OF THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY ACCORDING TO WEST HE COMPELS US TO ACKNOWLEDGE COLONIALISM IS A SUSTAINED BARBARIC WAR WAGED AGAINST COLONIZED PEOPLE SANCTIONED BY WESTERN VALUES WHAT'S MORE COLONIALISM SUS WEST IS NOT A FAR FROM HOME PROBLEM IT MEANS THE WEST MUST BE DEMOLISHED FOR FINON WEST SAYS REVOLUTIONARY INTERNATIONALISM ANTIIMPERIALISM ANTI CAPITALISM ANTI COLONIALISM ANTI PATRIARICALISM ANTIWETETO PREMISY YIELDS A NEW HUMANISM THAT PUTS A PREMIUM ON THE SYCHIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL NEEDS OF POOR AND WORKING PEOPLES A SOLIDARITY IN UNIVERSALITY FROM BELOW WEST EXPLAINS QUOTE IN OUR PRESENT AY MOMENTS OF IMPERIAL DECAY AND CAPITALIST DO PREPITUDE THE SPIRIT OF FINON IS MOST MANIFEST IN ANY AMERICAN IMPERIALIST CONTECT IN THE REVOLUTIONARY INTERNATIONALIST WINGS OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT AND THE PALISTINIALIZE MATTER MOVEMENT A LINE WITH THE BOYCOS DIVESTMENT AND SANCTIONS EFFORT THE COALITION IS NOW COMPLETE THE ALLIANCE OF THE SUPPOSEDLY MARGINALIZED MARCH TOGETHER ARMANARM TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WEST AND IN PARTICULAR THE UNITED STATES AFTER ALL THE UNITED STATES EVEN ACCORDING TO FINOLA I NINETEEN SIXTY ONE HAD BECOME THE CHIEF COLONIZER THANKS TO ITS POWER QUOTE TWO CENTURIES AGO A FORMER EUROPEAN COLONY DECIDED TO CATCH UP WITH EUROPE IT SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT THE UNITED STATES BECOME A MONSTER IN WHICH THE TAINS THE SICKNESS INHUMANITY OF EUROPE HAVE GROWN TO UPHAULING DIMENTIONS UN QUOTE THE ALLIANCE TO DESTROY THE WEST SPANS THE GLOBE AND ITS RIGHT CURAT HOME TO THREATENING EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR IFTY COLONIZATION IS MERELY A CODEWARD FOR ATTACKING VE POWERFUL AND THE SYSTEMS THAT SUPPOSEDLY SUSTAIN THEM THEN QUEERS FOR PALISTINE BEGINS TO MAKE A LOT OF CENS THAT'S WHY THE SAME PEOPLE CATTERWAULING OVER THE USE OF THE WRONG PRONOUN WILL CELEBRATE THE BURNING OF BABIES IN THE GASA ENVELOPE AS WASHINGTON POST

RETIURE OF PALISTINIAN DAILY REALITY IN LIGHT OF THE HISTRY AN STATEMENTS BY THE USU REGIONS DEMANIZING THE BOYCOTS VESTMEN AND SANCTIONS MOVEMENT AND OTHER FORMS OF PALISTINIAN SOLIDARITY WE HAVE NO CONFIDENTS THU SE ADMINISTRATION COMPREHENDS OR RESPECTS IT'S OBLIGATIONS IT IS DEEPLY DISTRESSING THE U SEE AND OTHER HIGHER INSTITUTIONS AD MINISTRATIVE STATEMENTS IN LAST WEEK AN A HALF THAT IRRESPONSIBLY WEELD CHARGES OF TERRORISM AND UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A CLIMAT THT IS MADE PALICINANS UDENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON SAFE GET TH THIS THE THE BIG LIE I'M NOT MERELY ENJOYING THE BIG LIVE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY FEEL ON SAFE ON CAMPISON THESE DAYS ARE OBVIOUSLY THE PROCOMAS PROTESTORS ARE MARCHING ON MASS THROUGH CAMPUSSES AND THREATENING PEOPLE BY T EWAY HOW PATHETIC ARE OURE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS THERE SO PATHETIC THE TOBRANDIZED UNIVERSITY WHICH WAS FOUNDED BY THE AMERICAN JEWISH COMMUNITY ETBRANDI'S UNIVERSITY STUDENT LEADERS VOTED TEN TO SIX NOT TO CONDEMN COMOSS NOT TO CONDEMCOMOSS YO ONLY CON A SENIOR AT TH UNIVERSITY SAID THAT HE STANDS WITH PALISINIANS BUT THIS IS STILL ABOUT CONDEMNING EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION BUT HE WAS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE MINORITY SO AMAZING STUFFED THERE FROM BRANDAS SO AGAIN THIS IS A GROUP OF YOUNG HIGHLY EDUCATED USUALLY UPPER CLASS STUDENTS WHO ARE FULLY IN LEE WITH THE IDEOLOGY OF TERRORISM BECAUSE COMMOSSAGEUS PART OF THE VIOLENT COLITION TO TEAR DOWN I CIVILIZATIONS THEY HAVE TO STAND BY THE RUDDIES AND AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT ALSO THERE'S A SENSE OF TREMENDOUS ANTITLEMENT FROM THESE FOLKS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO A JOB FROM YOU THEYRE ENTITLED TO YOUR TAX PARED OUTS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR SUPPORT PROLUBEST EXAMPLE THIS THAT I'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IS A PERSONAMED RHINUT WORKMEN RHINA WORKMEAN IS A A MEMBER OF THE AND WHY YOU STUDENT COUNCIL IN FACT A RHINA WORKMAN IS THE M STUDENT THE THE AND WHY YOU LAWSCHOOLS STUDENT BAR ASSOCIATION PRESIDENTS SO SHE'S CAUGHT ON CAMERA TO FACING POSTERS OF CANNAPTIS RAILIES I SO THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT HAS BECOME UNBELIEVABLY COMMENT AND AND PRETTY SHOCKING BECAUSE THESE ARE JUST POSTRS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LITERALLY BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY TERRORIS GROUP AND PRO COMASS PEOPLE YOU CAN'T CALL THESE PRO PALCINIAN PEOPLE BECAUSE THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WITH BEING PROPALISTINIAN PEOPLE I MEAN IF IT DOES THEN I THINK YOU'RE GETTING THE ISSUEWRONG THEY'RE LITERALLY TEARING DOWN POSTERS OF OF KIDNAP CHILDREN OR TO FACE THEM HERE'S RHINA WORKMEN DOING JUST THAT A TEIE THATS AT IT OS WI THI A  MA ASE E RE E TE I ITA TO CO I THER RTE DOING TO I PRIAN VERY I WHAT A SOCIATIN SI HO A UT TO EVERYTHIN ER SINTLI THI WHET R TE DOING TO THE OVER IS HOSES  IT'S T O DOIS I AND TUM AND OF COURSE SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY SHES JUST STANDING THER OF CORST HE'S NOT GIVING HER NAME WHILE SHE HAD HER HER JOB AT A LAW FORM WRECINDED BECASE IT TURNS OUT THE LAW FROMS DON'T LIKE TO EMPLOY TERROR SYMPATHIZERS IT'S NOT IS NOTE THEIR BIGGEST THING SO WHAT IS THAT MEAN ONE MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THE MEDIA TO JUMP IN AND FINALLY TALK ABOUT FREESPEECH ON COLLEGE CAMPS AS WOL THAT IS AMAZING SO WHEN SPEAKERS LIKE ME GET BAND FROM SADE TO PAUL UNIVERSITY THAT'S NOT NATIONAL NEWS IT IS DEFINITELY NATIONAL NEWS WHEN YOU DON'T GET A JOB BEING A TERROR SYMPATHIZER THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE SO HERE IS A B C NEWS COVERING RHINA WORKMEN I MEAN THE THE SENSE OF ABSOLUTE INTITLEMENT FROM THESE PRIVILEGED PATTY PATHETIC LEFT WINGERS WHO AGAIN ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THE CUONNO QUOT WRETCHED OF THE EARTHACORN FINA IT'S IT'S REALLY IT'S QUITE DISCUSTING AND PEOPLE SHOULD REALIZE HOW REVOLUTIONARY THE IMPLICATIONS ARE HERE IS RHINA WORKMEN DECLARING THAT NOT ONLY IS SHE ENTITLE TO TEAR DOWN POSTERS OF CANNAP CHILDREN SHE'S INTITLE TO A JOB FROM YOU AND YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO HERR IT'S BECAUSE YOUR DISCRIMINITORY IF YOU WERN TO REA TO THE LATTER  AVISLY WITH THE BENEFIT OF HIND SIGHT ANYTHING YOU WOULDHAVE DONE DIFFERENTWAY I THINK I ILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK UP FOR PALESON IN HUMAN RIHTES AND USE WHATEVER PLATFORM I HAVE AVAILABLE TO ME TO CALL FOR ISTYS FIRE AND YOU KNOW IN THIS OCCUPATION THAT'S HARMING THE PALESINIANS I MA JUST TRY ONE MORE TIME WOEN'T YOU CHANGE ANYTHING EVEN THE TIMING OF IT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO SOON BECAUSE YOUR LETTER CAME THE FOR ISRAIL EVEN LAUNCH ANY KIND OF RETALIATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE GENICIDE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW DID NOT START ON OCTOBER SEVENH ITS STARTED OVER SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND THAT WAS WHAT MY MESSAGE WAS INTENDED TO GET ACROSS WAS THAT WE ARE SEEING VIOLENCE HAPPENING THAT IS PART OF A MUCH LARGER A STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE A SYSTEM THAT IS HAPPENING IND PALESTINE RIGHT NOW DO YOU CONDAMNSTRUCTURAL VIOLENCE ON THAT'S IS THAS TAY HAVNS A SETTLER CLO KNOS MA ATI WHAT I USE MY PLATFORM FOR AND WHO I CONDEMN WAS PRETTY CLEAR BY MY MESSAGE AND I THINK THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO CONDEMNAPARTIDE AND MILITARY OCCUPATION AND THAT IN THIS MOMENT I'M FOC  KNOW THAT'S NOT CALLING FOR AN INTIGENICIDE AND CALLING FOR AN IMMEDIATESY FIRE DO YOU THINK  IN THE SPACE THAT WERE IN RIGHT NOW THERE IS ROOM TO HAVE AMPATHY FOR THE ISRAILIES WHO LOST THEIR LIVES WHO WERE BRUTALIZED WERE RAPED AND ALSO AMPATHY FOR THE PALESTINIANS WHO ARE SIMILARLY LOSING THEIR LIVES YET I THINK RIGHT NOW IF YOU TURN ON ANY MAINSTREAME CHANNEL YOU'LL SEE THE STORIES OF THIS RALIES ON EVERY SCREEN YOU LOOK TO AND SO I THINK FOR ME I WILL CONTINUE T USE MY PLATFORM TO UPLIFT THE VOICES OF PALESTINIANS AND THE STRUGGLES THERE GOING THROUGH BECAUSE BYT NOW WE HAVE ME A THISISS IS THE WHOLE THING IN ONE YOU LOST THE HOLTHING THE RHINA WORKMEN MEAN POSS OF THEIR RINA WORKMEN USEIS THA THEM PRONOUNS RHINA WORKMEN CONSIDERS HERSELF OBVIOUSLY WOMAN CONSIDERS HERSELF TO BE A MEMBER OF QUEERS FOR A LIBERATED PALESTINE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THAT'S HAT THIS IS SHE PUT OUT A STATEMENT BE FOR IS RAEL ACTUALLY DID ANYTHING CONDEMNING ISRAEL FOR THE DEAD JUWS THAT'S WHAT SHEU DID WHY BEGUS AGAN IT'S PART OF THE BROADER RUBRIC OF MARGINALIZED OF THE EARTH UNITE AND TERR DOWN AT THE CORNQUAL COLONIZES BUT COLONIZERS THEY JUST MEAN ANYBODY WHO HAS POWER WHE THE POWER IS IS GOTTEN USEFULLY OR NOT WHETHER THE POWERFUL AR MORAL OR OTHER NIGHT DOESN'T MATTER IT DISN'T MATTER AS LONG AS YOU ARE A MEMBER OF QUOIN QHAT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY IT'S THE COALITION TO DESTROY THE SYSTEMS THET REALLY MATTERS A MAD SHOULD SCARE EVERYBODY BECAUSE THAT'S A LOT OF YOUR KIDS THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT YOUR YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL WITH A COLLEGE CAMPASSES THAT IS A RISING MOVEMENT ON THE LEFT AND IT IS VERY STRONG IT IS NOT A TINY MINORITY ON COLLEGE CAMPASSES THERE IS A REASON WHY YOU CAN BARILY GET FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES TO SAY THE COMMOSSE TERRIS

PRESSURE TO STRIKE ARON IN PROXIES THAT AVE RE PEATEDLY AN ANTACT AND INJURED YOU UST TROOPS IN A ROCK AND SYRIA THIS MONTH BUT HE'S WAYING ANY DESISION FOR ATALIAT AGAINST HAS BROUGHTER CONCERN THAT THE WARN GOSIC CULD BE ON THE PRECIPICE OF ERUPTING INTO A REGION WHY TEMPEST WHAT LIF THE TRUTH IS THE THING THT WILL KEEP IT FROM ERUPTING INTO A REGION BY TEMPEST IS IF THE UNITED STATES MAKES CLEAR THAT IF YDOU INJURE OUR TROOPS WE'LL STUMP ON YOU LIKE A FLY IK THAT THAT HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN THE AMERICAN WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN THESE PLACES AND THAT HAS IN FACT WORKED WHEN WHEN AMERICAN TROOPS ARE ATTACKD THE ONLY WAY TO PUSH PEOPLE OFF OF DOING THAT IS TO MAKE IT VERY CLAR TO THEM THAT IF THEY DO THAT THAY IN THEIR BODYSE DIE ANDHAT THERE'S A REASON THAT DONAL TRUMP TO THIS EXACTLY RIGHT WHEN HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IF THERE WAREATACKS ON AMERICAN TROUPS ONL FROM RESPONDED IN KIND AND HE DID SO WITH ALACRITY IT WAS  WAS DOWN TRUMBLE PULL THE TRIGGER ON

RE PUBLICANS LAST NIGHT THEY DECIDED YOU STOP KICKING THEMSELF DIRECTLY IN THE NADS AND INSTEAD THEY DECIDED TO ACTUALLY VOTE IN FAVOR OF MAKE  JOHNSON TO MAKE JOHNSON SOMEBODY THAT I WOUD TAKE MOST OF AMERICA HAD NOT HEARD OF LIKE EVER HE WAS ONLY ELECTED TO CONGRESS FAIRLY RECENTLY HES A MEAN IN CONGRESS ALL THAT LONG HE IS A A CONGRESSMAN FROM LOUISIANA ACCORDING TO POLITICO HIS E ANANIMITY IN WASHINGTON WAS THE DRIVING FORCE IN HIS ELECTION AS SPEAKER BECAUSE HE HADN'T MADE ANY ENEMIES YET HE BECAME THE UNLIKELY LEADER OF AN UNRULY GROUP OF HOUSE RE PUBLICANS WILL NOW RELY ON HIM TO RUN THEIR SIDE O THE CAPITAL HE WAS NEXT TO NO ONES FIRST PICK BUT AGAIN EVERYBODY ELSE HAD A HIGH PROFILE AND THAT MEN THAT HE WAS THE GUY WHO CAN A SNEAKIN UNDER THE RATAR NOW JOHNSON MUST FIGUR HOW TO CHEEVE UT MC CARTHY COULDN'T COMPROMISE THAT DOESN'T PROMPT MUTINY NOW HE'S GANHAVEN EASIER TIME WITH THAT THE REASONG'S CAN AVEN EASE YOUR TIME WITH THAT THAN MC CARTHY DID IS BECAUSE HE'S NOT NAME COVE MC CARTHY SERIOUSLY THAT IT'S THAT SIMPLE MATGATES AND A FEW OF HIS CREW DECIDED THEY HATE HI MC CARTHY AND SO THAT MENT IS THAT ANY COMPROMISED THE C CARTHY COUHT WAS GOING TO BE SEEN AS TREASON BY GATES AN COMPANY AND USED AS AN EXCUSE TO GET RID OF MC CARTHY WELL NOW  JOHNSON IS GIN A COMIN HE'S GOIN TO DO KIND OF EXACTLY WHAT MC CARTHY DID BECAUSE THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE IS PRECISELY THE SAME SO TO TAKEIN EXAMPLE MC CARTHY JUST CUT A CONTINUING RESOLUTION HE COUT IT WITH SIME DEMOCRATS THE REASON HE HAD TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE HEGET A BETTER CONTINING RESOLUTION DEAL TERE WAS SCUTTLE BY GATES IN COMPANY TEN AFTER MC CARTHY ACTUALLY DID THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION TO FUN THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S WHEN HE WAS ALSTED BY GATES IN COMPANY WELL NOW MA JOHNSONS GOIN T COMEIN AN YOR HE'S PROPOSING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS THE SAME SORT OF STUFF NOW HE CAN PASS A BUNCH OF SINGLE ISSUE BILLS SUPPOSEDLY PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS BILLS DO THE PROCESS AN ALL THAT BUT DEMOCRATSIGON A REJECTED AN 'S GIVEN COME BACK TO DOING CONTUNING RESOLUTION NOW THE THING IS THAT BECAUSE GATES OUTSTID MC CARTHY AND BECAUSE JOHNSON IS THE NEW SPEAKER HE HAS AN INCENTIVE GATES DOES IN MAKING JOHNSON APPEARED TO BE BETTER THAN MC CARTHY WHICH MEANS THTHE IS NOT GOING TO YELLIN SCREAM ABOUT ANY DEAL THAT JOHNSON CUTS SO INHERENTLY JOHNSON HAS MORE LEE WAY TO CUT DEALS AND MAKE DEALS THAN MC CARTHY DID MAINLY BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE INCENTIVISE TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY FOR THE PUBLICITY ALREADY DID THAT AS THEY CAN'T DO IT AGAIN THEY HAVE TO PLAY THIS AS THOUGH THEY THEYE CHIEFSOMS FOR MASS OF WIN BY SUBSTITUTING JOHNSAN FOR MC CARTHY ANDNAGAIN THE POLICY IS IN A COME OUT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME IT'S CAN BE VERY VERY VERY SIMILAR NOW THE FACT IS THAT JOHNSON HAS A LOTLESS EXPERIENC THE MC CARTHY IN THE SPACE T AGAIN IS NOT A RIP ON JOHNSON JOHNSON'S GREAT I'M TO GO THROUGH HIS OPENING SPEECH IN A SECOND WHEN HE WHEN HE WON THESPEAKERSHIP AN IT'S EXCELLENT IS REALLY REALLY REALY GOOD I  I HAPPEN TA RESONATE TO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WHAT JOHNSON SAYS AS A SPEAKER I THINK HE'S WAY MORD APPEALING THEN THEN CEM MC CARTHY WAS HOWEVER THE SPEAKEROF THE HOUSE IS JOB HE'S NOT JUST TO BE A A A PERSON WHO SPEAKS WELL AND A PERSON WHO COMMUNICATES WHILE THE SPEAKER O THE HOUSE ESSENTIALLY HAS SEVERAL JOBS ONE IS TO YA SPEAK WELL AND AND MAINTAIN POLICY POSITIONS BUT THE CAN A BIGGER ASPECTS ARE VOTE COUNTING VOTE WHIPPING REWARDING ALLIES AND PUNISHING ANIMIES GETTING TOGETHER OUR COLISH AN ACTUALLY DO THINGS AND MOU CUIRES A LOT OF BACK SCRATCHING REQUIRES A LOT OF MANEUVERING REQUIRES THE CAN A MOCKYV ALLEAN STUFF THAT MC CARTHY WAS ACTUAL PRETTY GOOD AT I DON'T NOW IF JOHNSON HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE THAT MAYBEIS GREAT AT IT WE DON'T KNOW HE'S NEVER DONE IT BEFORE THE SPEAKER ALSO ISPPOSE TO FUND RAYS FOR PRETTY MUCH ALL THE RE PUBLICANS ACROSS THE BOARD SO MC CARTHY OVER THE COURSE OF HIS TIME IN HOUSE LEADERSHIP RAISED ALMOST HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR VARIOUS HOUSE RE PUBLICAN CANDIDATES INCLUDING MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO THEN OUSEED HIM MIKE JOHNSON IN LAST ELECTION CYCLE YOUAN EXPECT HIM ARAYS TENS MILLIONSOF DOLLARS HE'S BROUGHT ONE GUY RUNNING IN AN UNCONTESTED DISTRICTS IN LISIANA MIKE JOHNSON IN HIS LAST ELECTION CYCLE RAISED ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO CAN HE TRANS LATE THAT OVER IN'S RAISEING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR FELLOW CANDIDATES MC CARTHY WHEN RECRUITED A BUNCH OF CANDIDATES IN PURPLE DISTRICTS  JOHNSON HASN'T REALY DONE THAT YET SO AGAIN HE'S ENOUGH TO PROVE THAT HE CAN DO ALL OF THE HARD NOSED THINGS THE MC CARTHY COULD DO AND THERE'S A LOT OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCECUER BEING SPEAKER O THE HOUSE IS TELLING ANYBODY CAN JUST WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR AND SUDDENLY TRANSFORM THE PLACE IF YOU DON'T FILE A BILID TO PROPER TIME DHE MC CRATS COULD SNEAK IN THT CULD FLIP THE BILLICE IT THEY'RE REALLY ARE A LOT OF PROCEDRAL COMPLEXIES DON JOHNSON MADE VERY WELL BEABLE TO HANDLE IT WE JUST DON'T KNOW HIT SO THE THE NOTION THAT THAT THINGS ARE GIN TA RATICALLY CHANGE IN TH HOUSE NOW THAT ITS JOHNSON AS OPPOSED TO MC CARTHY IS REALLY SILLY NIT AGAIN NONE OF THAT'S A RIP ON JOHNSON IT IS A RIP ON GATESONTIM THE IDEA THAT THE CATESONS HE MACHIEVES SOME SORT OF MASSIVE MATERIAL VICTORY BY THROWING THE HOUSON TO FULL ON CHAOS FOR THREE WEEKS IN DEMONSTRATING THE FRACTUOUSNESS AN IDIOCY OF OF PART OFTHEIR PUBLICAN CAUKUS I DON'T BUY IT I DON'T SEE IT AND TAT THAT IS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO WHAT HAPPENS GOING FORD WITH WITH JOHNSON IN SO HERE ARE A FEW THINGS ABOUT MIKE JOHNSON THAT ARE AR KIND OF AUSUM SO MIKE JOHNSON VERY VERY SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE HIS A NINETY PER CENT LIFETIME RATING FROM HERITAGE ACTION NINETY TWO PER CENT FROM THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION HE IS VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF CUTTING SPENDING WHICH IS SOMETHING BY THE WAY LOT OF MAGNATYPE ARE NOT REALLY BIG IN FAVOR OF THE COUNT LIKE DISPENNING DEPENDING ON WHO THEY ARE HEIS VERY STRONG ON ABORTION EXTREMELY PROLIKE HAS AN APLUS RATING FROM THE SUSAN B ANTHONY PROLIFE AMERICA GROUP HE IS TO WORK AS THE SENIOR LEGAL COUNSIL FROR THE ALLIANCE DEFENSE FUND AND A HE IS ANTI SAME SEX MARRIAGE FOR EXAMPLE HE HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY WHICH BY THE WAY IS HE HISTORICALLY CORRECT HIS ITION OF THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY AND A MAN AND A WOMAN OUR MARRIAGE AND THAT ANY OTHER FORM OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIP IS NOT THE SAME U MORALLY OR SOCIOLOGICALLY HE UM HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ATTEMPTS TO TOS STALL SORTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION POST TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS IS BEING USED AS A CLUB BY DEMOCRATS ALREADY HE DEVISED IN ARGUMENT DOES ECTUALY THE ONLY GOOD ARGUMENT THATWAS MADE IN THE AFTFROMATH OF NOVEMBER SEVENTH WHICH IS A SENTURY THE LOT OF STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA HAD UNALATERALLY SHIFTED THEIR VOTING LAWS SO AS TO BENEFIT DEMOCRATS IN WAYS THAT WERE LEGAL THAT WAS LIKE THE ONLY GOOD LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE DURING THAT ENTIRE SPECTACLE JOHNSON WAS ONE MAKING THOSE ARGUMENTS AND HE SEND SOME STUFF DURING THAT TIME THAT FRANKLY IS RIDICULOUS ARE HE HE CALLED IN TO QUESTION THE VOTING SYSTEMS INCIDE EDVEN IS WHAYLAND WLD OS SINY POWELL KIND OF STUFF BUT HE IS NOW MOVING AWAY FROM THAT I ASSUM THA HE'S GOING TO IGNORE ALL OF THAT THAS MEAN DEMOCRATS ARCAN JUMP ON WHICH WILLGET TO A MOMENT BUT JOHNSON GAVE A REALLY QUITE BEAUTIFUL SPEECH LAST NIGHT ON BECOMING SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE HE OPEND BY THANKING KEP MC ARTHY I WANT I WANT TO A EXPRESS MY GREAT THANKS FOR OUR SPEAKER AMERITUS CAVEN MC CART CEAVEN HAS DEDICATED OVER TWO DEKAGE OF HIS LIFE TO SELPLICE PUBLIC SERVICE SIXTEEN OF THOSE YEARS IN THIS HOUSE AND YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIDED ANYBODY WHO LOVES THIS INSTITUTION MORE OR IS CONTRIBUTED MORE TO IT HE IS THE REASON WE'RE IN THIS MAJORITY TO DAY SO HE STARTED OFF WITH THAT HE THEN MOVED ON TO THE FACT THAT IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO WORK WHICH OF COURSE IS TRUE IS IS NOT BEEN A GOOD MOMENT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THEY LOOK LIKE CLOWNS SO RESTORING SOME SORT OF SEMBLANCE OF DIGNITY TO THE REPUBLICAN CALKAS WOULD CERTAINLY BE APPLAUSE I WANT TO SAY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US HERE WE HEAR YOU WE KNOW THE CHALLENGEIS YOUR FACE IN WE WE KNOW THAT TO THAT THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD AND WE ARE READY TO GET TO WORK AGAIN TO SOLVE THOSE PROPS AND WE WILL OUR MISSION HERE IS TO SERVE YOU WELL TO RESTORE THE PEOPLE'S FAITH IN THIS HOUSE IN THIS GREAT AND ESSENSIAL INSTITUTION AN HE CONTINUED ALONG THESE LINES HE SAID THE DEPRIVE THE INSTITUTION IS IN JEOPARDINAS TIME TO RESTORED THAT PRIDE THAT OF COURSE IS TRUE AS WELL AND AND I THINK ALL OF OUR PARENTS ARE PROUD OF WHAT WE'RE CALLED TO DO HERE I THINK ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AT ONE TIME A GREAT PRIDE IN THIS INSTITUTION BUT RIGHT NOW A THAT'S IN JEOPARTY AND WE HAVE A CHALLEGE BEFORE US RIGHT NOW TO REBUILD AND RESTORE THAT TRUST HEIS OF COURSE RIGHT ABOUT THAT AS WELL NOW ON PRINCIPLE HE'S A VERY STRONG TRANITIONAL CONSERVATIVE HE'S PRETTY HAWKISH ON FORM POLICY HE VOTED AGAINST SOME OF THE ACRANE APPROPRIATIONS BILSE THAT PROBLY THE BIGGEST DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIM AND MC CARTHY IS THE MC CARTHY WAS PRO FUNDING FOR YOU CRANE AND IN THE INITIAL RESPONDS MIGHT JOHNSON WAS PRO FUNDING OF YOU CRANE AND THEN AFTER WE GAVE THEM LIKE A HUNDRBILLIAN DOLLARS THEN HE STARTED TO TET SKIDDISH ABOUT IT AND HE SUGGEST THAT HE IS NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT BUT THAT'S ALSO WHERE THE REPUBLICAN CAWCASIS THE POSSIBILITY OF PASSING LARGE SKALE YOU CRANE FUNDING ON A STANTALON BASIS WAS AN ON STARTER INSIDE THE CAWCAS ANYWAY THAT'S OBVIOUSLY DIRECTION AT THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY HAS MOVED WILL GET TO MORE FROM MIKE JOHNSON IN  JUST AT ONE SECOND THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FIRST WE DO THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY HERE AT DAILYWIRE WE HOST A LOT OF HUGE POD CAS OF COURSE WE

MAE JOHNSON AGAIN HIS HIS SPEECH LASIN WAS EXCELLENT WHEN HE GOT TO HIS PRINCIPLES THI PARTICULARLY GOOD SO MIKE JOHNSON TICKED OFF A LOT OF LEFT LAST NIGHT WHEN BEFORE HE ASSUMED HIS SPEAKERSHIP POSITION HEACTUALLY NELT IN PRAYER WITH BUNCH O THER MEMBERS THE REPUBLICAN CAWCAS AND THIS OF COURSE IS VERY BAD NOT'SPOS TO THIS IS SUPEROFFENSIVE TO YOU KNOW PAY TRIBUTE TO GOD AFTER YOU ACHIEVE SOMETHING WIF TE MAGNUTUD BECOMING SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN THE UNITED STATES TO AMERICA THAT OF COURSE IS IS DEEPLY FFENS IF DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC CLEARLY AMIN BEING RECHEUTED TO LEAVE IN BEING NACTURAL TERRA SUPPORTER O CA ACCORDING TO DEMOCRATS KNEWING FOR PRAYER ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE THAT OF COURSE THE HUGE PROBLEM YOU'RE LATANNEEL IN CENTA CLOTH FOR GEORGE FLOID YOU'RE JUST NOT ALLOWED TO DO IT FOR GOD I WITHOUT THE CONTIN CLOTHAN NCIS MAE JOHNSON HE SAID LAST NIGHT THAT IT'S TIME TO REJECT EIGHTHEISM AND MARXISM NINETEEN SIXTYX TWO AN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO THAT THAT AR NATIONAL MATO THIN GOD WE TRUST WAS IT THE ADORNED ABOVE THIS ROSTRUM AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITTLE A GUI THAT THEY GIVE THE TURIST AND CONSTITUENT WO COMON IN AN VISIT THE HOUSE IF YOU TURN IN THERE TO ABOUT PAGE FOURTEEN IN THE MIDDLE TET GUID IT TELLS YOU THE HISTORY OF THIS NIT SAYS VERY SIMPLY THESE WORDS WERE PLACE HERE ABOVE US THIS MATO WAS PLACED HERE AS A REBUKE OF THE COLD WAR EROF PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOVIET UNION THAT PHILOSOPHY WAS MARXISM AND COMMUNIS SO OBVIOUSLY  HEIS SLAPPING AT SOME MEMBERS HOF T E LEFT THEN HE LISTED WHAT HE CALLED TO SEVEN COR PRINCIPLES OF CONSERVATISM I THESE A PRETRITIONAL I THIN IT'S REALLY QUEN ESSENTIALLY THE COR PRINCIPLES OF OUR NATION I BULL THEM DOWN TH INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM LIMITED GOVERNMENT THE RULE OF LAW PIECE THEIR STRENGTH THIS CORRESPONSIBILITY

TRITIONALLY CONSERVATIVE SPEAKER OFTHE HOUSE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING I HOPE THAT HE PULLS THE LEVERS IN A MORE CONSERVATIVE DIRECTION THAN HOUSE LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO I ALSO UNDERSTAND AS I'V SAID THE INCENSIVE STRUCTURE AND THE INCENSIVE STRUCTURE MEANS HE HAS A DEMOCRAT SENNATE IS A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HE HAS AN EXTREMELY THIN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND ALL TAKES A FEW GRAND STANDERS TO MAKE IT THAT HE HAS TO CON TO DEAL WITH DEMOCRATS AGAIN IN THE INITIAL RUN I EXPECTHED H'S GOINGTO GET THE SUPPORT OF MANYOF PEOPLEWHO HOUSED IN MC CARTHY SO THOSE

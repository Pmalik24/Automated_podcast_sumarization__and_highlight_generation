WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN TASCIENCESCIENCEEI MANDERHUBERMAN AND ON PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS MONTH WERE TALKING ALL ABOUT DISORDERS OF THE MIND THINGS LIKE DEPRESSION ATTENTION DEFICITE DISORDERS EATING DISORDERS SKITZ OPHRENIA AND BY POLAR DISORDER DURING THE COURSE OF THIS MONTH WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL UNDER PINNINGS OF MOOD DISORDERS OF ALL KINDS YOU'LL LEARN A LOT OF SCIENCE YOU'LL ALSO LEARN A LOT ABOUT THE VARIOUS TREATMENTS THAT EXIST AND THAT ARE INDEVELOPMENT FOR THESE VARIOUS MOOD DISORDERS WE WILL TALK ABOUT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THINGS LIKE EXERCISE MEDITATION BREATHWORK BUT ALSO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SUPPLEMENTS AND NOVEL COMPOUNDS THAT ARE NOW BEING TESTED IN VARIOUS CLINICAL TRIALS ACROSS THE MONTH I THINK YOU'LL START TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE COMMON PATHWAYS UNDERLYING MANY MOOD DISORDERS IN FACT MOO DISORDERS THAT LOOK QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER OFTEN DEPEND ON THE ACTION OF THE SAME NEUROCHEMICALS OR NEURL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ACTUALLY SHOULD BE A POINT OF GREAT RELIEF BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT BY UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY OF ONE MOOD DISORDER OR UNDERSTANDING HOW ONE TREATMENT OR BEHAVIOR LI INTERVENTION CAN IMPACT A MOOD DISORDER WE GAIN INSIGHT INTO OTHER MOOD DISORDERS AS WELL AS ALWAYS WE WILL DISCUSS SCIENCE AND SCINCE RELATED TOOLS THAT PEOPLE COULD IMPLEMENT SHOULD THEY CHOOSE BEFORE WE DIVE INTO TO DAY'S TOPIC I LIKE TO DISCUSS A VERY PARTICULAR SET OF SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS THAT RELATE TO TO DAY'S TOPIC AND THAT ORE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING ALL MOD DISORDERS AND ALL STATES OF MOTIVATION HAPPINESS AND SADNESS AS WELL AS DEPRESSION BASICALLY I 'M GOING TO PARAPHRASE A BRIEF SEGMENT OF MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR ANALEMPKI WHO I SAT DOWN WITH THE DISCUSS A DICTION AND THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF A DICTION AND ADDICTION TREATMENT A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT DISCUSSION WAS WHEN DOCTOR LEMPKI DISCRIBED THE PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE LITERALLY THE CIRCUITS IN OUR BRAINS THAT CONTROL OUR SENSE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND ULTIMATELY WHETHER NOT WE REMAIN HAPPY IN OUR PURSUIT OF PLEASURE OR NOT THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL ASPECT TO THE WAY THAT WE FUNCTION IN EVERYDAY LIFE AND ESPECIALLY UNDER CONDITIONS OF MOOD DISORDERS THE PATHWAY THAT SHO AS DESCRIBING IS THE SO CALLED PLEASURE SYSTEM HOWEVER WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT THE PLEASURE SYSTEM IS ALSO DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AND IN FACT IS THE VERY SAME SYSTEM THAT MODULATES MENTAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL ANGUISH AND PAIN ESSENTIALLY WHAT SHE DESCRIBED IS THAT WHENEVER WE PURSUE SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WILL BRING US PLEASURE AND THAT COULD BE ANYTHING THAT WE THINK WILL BRING US PLEASURE FROM FOOD TO VIDIO GAMES TO SECTS TO A PARTICULA R JOB OR GOAL SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM THAT WE EXPERIENCE RELEASE OF THE NERMODULATOR DOPAMINE NOW DOPAMINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LEVELS OF MOTIVATION IN DRIVE IT IS NOT THE MOLECULE F REWARD IT IS THE MOLECULE OF CRAVING MOTIVATION AND DRIVE HOWEVER AS DOCTOR LEMKI POINTED OUT WHEN WE ARE IN PURSUIT OF SOMETHING THERE IS A RELEASE OF DOPAMINE IN OUR BRAIN THAT MAKES US FEEL MOTIVATED AND IN GENERAL IT MAKES US FEEL GOOD BUT VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND BENEATH ARE OUR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS THERE IS A TILT OF THE PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE IN THE BRAIN LITERALLY A SHIFT IN THE NURLE CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE PLEASURE AND PAIN SUCH THAT EVERY BIT OF PLEASURE OR PLEASURER SEEKING THAT CAUSES RELEASE OF DOPAMINE WILL WE BALANCE DOUBT BY A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN AND WE DON'T EXPERIENCE THIS AS PHYSICAL PAIN AT LEAST NOT AT FIRST WE EXPERIENCE IT AS CRAVING FOR MORE OF THE THING THAT BROUGHT US PLEASURE NOW THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD YOU GET PLEASURE AND THEN HE GET A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN TO BALANCE IT OUT ITS SUBCONSCIOUS AND YOU EXPERIENCE IT AS THE DESIRE TO SEEK OUT MORE PLEASURE HOWEVER ITS ACTUALLY MORE DIABOLICAL THAN THAT AND WE REALLY NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS IF WE ARE TO REMAIN HAPPY IF WE ARE TO REMAIN IN PURSUIT OF OUR GOALS THE CRUCIAL THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IF WE REMAIN IN CONSTANT PURSUIT OF PLEASURE THE PAINSIDE OF THE BALANCE TIPS SO THAT EACH TIME WE ARE IN PURSUIT OF THAT PLEASUREFUL THING ACTIVITY OR SUBSTANCE WE ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE WE LITERLLY ACHIEVE LESS DOPAMINE RELEASE EACH SUBSEQUENT TIME SO WE GET LESS PLEASURE AND THE AMOUNT OF CRAVING INCREASES NOW AFTER A CERTAIN POINT OR THRESHOLD WE CALL THAT ADDICTION AND THE WAY TO RESET THE BALANCE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THE WAY TO RESET THE BALANCE IS ACTUALLYD TO ENTER INTO STATES IN WHICH WE ARE NOT IN PURSUIT OF PLEASURE TO LITERALLY ENTERE STATES IN WHICH WE ARE BORED MAY BE EVEN A LOE BORED AND ANXIOUS AND THAT RESETS THE PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE SO THAT WE CAN RETURN TO OUR PURSUIT OF PLEASURE IN A WAY THAT'S HEALTHY AND THAT IN AN ONGOING WAY WON'T LEAD TO THIS OVER TIPPING OR THIS INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PAIN OR ADDICTION SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IF THIS SEEMED VAGUE WHAT THIS MEANS IS WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE CAUTIOUS OF ANY STATE OF MIND OR BODY OR ANY PURSUIT THAT LEADS TO VERY LARGE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE AND IF IT DOES WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL TO NOT PURSUIE THAT REPEATEDLY OVER TIME DURING TO DAYIS EPISODE I'M GOING TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OF A DISCUSSION THAT HAVE BEEN IN WITH A YOUNG MAN WHOSE TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WHOSE DEALING WITH A DESRUPTION IN THIS PLESURE PAIN BALANCE HE IS ESSENTIALLY DEPRESSED AND HE IS DEPRESSED BECAUSE OF HIS ON GOING PURSUIT OF A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY THAT INITIALLY LED TO A LOT OF DOPAMNE BUT OVER TIME HAS LED TO LESS AND LESS DOPAMINE AND MORE AND MORE OF THIS PAINSIDE OF THE BALANCE WE COULD CALL HIM ADDICTED TO THAT PARTICULAR ACTIVITY WHETHER NOT HE'S ADDICTED BY CLINICAL STANDARDS ARE NOT REALLY ISN'T IMPORTANT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT HE EXPERIENCES THIS AS DEPRESSION AS LOW AFFECT AS IT'S CALLED OR AN HEDONIA AN INABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE FROM THAT THING OR FROM ANYTHING ELSE AND HE'S CURRENTLY UNDERGOING TREATMENT THROUGH A REBALANCING OF THIS PLEASURE PAIN PATHWAY SO WHILE I CAN'T REVEAL HIS IDENTITY TO YOU THAT WOULN'T BE APPROPRIATE HE DO GIVE ME PERMISSION TO REVEAL THE GENERAL ARCHITECTURE OF WHAT HE'S COPING WITH AND I SPEND SOME HOURS WITH HIM ON THE PHONE THIS WEEK TALKING TO HIM AS WELL AS TO THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT HE'S WORKING WHAT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AS I THINK IT CAN ILLUSTRATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOPAMINE PLEASURE AND PAIN FORSAKE OF ADDICTION BUT ALSO FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW TO AVOID DEPRESSIVE STATES HOW TO REMOVE OURSELVES FROM DISDEPRESSIVE STATES AND AS YOU'LL SEE TO DAY AS WE DISCUSS DEPRESSION MANY OF THE MOLECULES AND NERAL PATHWAYS IN BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT WE KNOW CAN BE USED TO COUNTER DEPRESSION FEED BACK ON TO THIS PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PDCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN

FOR NERVE SELFF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MANESIUM AN PETASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPERATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE ARE MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAING ON

ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT O TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTE DOCCAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY WE'RE DISCUSSING  DEPRESSION IN PARTICULAR WEREGIN TO TALK ABOUT MAJOR DEPRESSION THE PHRASE MAJOR DEPRESSION IS USED TO DISTINGUISH ONE FORM OF DEPRESSION FROM THE OTHER THE OTHER ONE BEING BY POLAR DEPRESSION BY POLAR DEPRESSION SOMETIMES CALLED BY POLAR DISORDER IS REALLY CHARACTERIZED BY MANIC HIES SO WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T SLEEPING AND THEIR TALKING VERY FAST AND THEIR BUYING THINGS IN PURSUING RESOURCES THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEYRE STARTING RELATIONSHIPS LEFT IN RIGHT THEI'R MANIC FOLLOWED BY PERIODS OF CRASHES OF FEELING VERY LOW LETHARGIC AND SO ON BY POLAR DEPRESSION IS AN ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THING FOR US TO DISCUSS AND THEREFORE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ENTIRE SEPARATE EPISODE RELATED TO BY POLAR DEPRESION TODAY WE'RE GIN O TALK ABOUT MAJOR DEPRESSION ALSO SOMETIMES CALLED UNI POLAR DEPRESSION JUST BECAUS IT DOESN'T HAVE THE HIGHES AND LOWS IT'S MORE CHARACTERIZED BY THE LOWS WE'REGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY THE PSYCHOLOGY AND THE VARIOUS TREATMENTS BEHAVIORAL DRUGS SUPPLEMENTATION DIET EXERCISE ALL OF THAT BEFORE WE GO FORWARD INTO THE MATERIAL I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT MOOD DISORDERS CARRIES WITH IT A PARTICULAR SENSITIVITY AND THAT SENSITIVITY IS ONE RELATED TO SELF DIAGNOSIS TODAY'S EPISODE AND INDEED IN THE FUTURE EPISODES FOR THIS MONTH ON MOOD DISORDERS YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR VERY SYMPTOMOLOGIES THAT ARE USED TO DIAGNOSE AND CHARACTERIZE THESE DISORDERS IF YOU RECOGNIZE SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMOLOGIES IN YOURSELF OR IN OTHERS THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO TAKE NOTE OF HOWEVER ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS REALLY SHOULD BE DONE BUY A QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL SO AT ONCE I'M SAYING KEEP YOUR EYES IN YOUR EARS UP FOR THINGS THAT SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU THAT MIGHT BE OF CONCERN AND AT THE SAME TIME I'M SAYING DON'T NECESSARILY LEAP TO CONCLUSIONS TAKE THOSE FLAGS OF CONCERN IF THEY'RE THERE AND BRING THEM TO A QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PROPERLY DIAGNOSE YOU W AS HAVING AN PARTICULAR MOO DISORDER OR DIAGNO SOMEBODY IS HAVING A PATICULAR MOOD DISORDER OR NOT AND THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL STEP IN DON'T SAY THIS TO PROTECT US I SAY THIS REALLY TO PROTECT YOU OQUE LET'S HAVE A FACT BASED  DISCUSSION ABOUT DEPRESSION AND I PROMISE YOU THAT WHERE WE DON'T KNOW CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT DEPRESSION I WILL BE CLEAR TO TELL YOU IN FACT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION THAT ARE LOOKING VERY PROMISING AND THAT RIGHT NOW ARE ACTUALLY BEING USED MORE AND MORE AND FROM MY READ OF THE MECHANISTIC LITERATURE WE'RE STILL A BIT IN THE DARK AS TO HOW THESE WORK NSICUALY COMMON THEME OF MEDICINE MANY TIMES THEIR TREATMENTS THAT SEEM PROMISING OR THAT LOOK REALLY TERRIFIC AND THERE ISN'T A LOT OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT MECHANISM HOWEVER ANY GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT NOR SCIENCE IND IN PARTICULAR ABOUT MOO DISORDERS HAS TO GET INTO MECHANISMS O O'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND IN DOING THAT WE'RE GOING TO FRAME THE DISCUSSION FOR THE TOOLS OF HOW TO KEEP DEPRESSION AT BAY AND HOW TO DEAL WITH IT IF YOU HAPPEN TO FIND YOURSELF DEPRESSED OR IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY ELSE WHO'SE DEPRESSED WHAT IS THIS THING WE CALL DEPRESSION WAS I MENTION BEFORE IT HAS TWO FORMS BY POLAR DEPRESSION WHICH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TO DAY AND MAJOR DEPRESSION ALSO CALLED UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION IS THE OTHER MAJOR DEPRESSION IMPACTS FIVE PER CENT OF THE POPULATION THAT IS ANY ENORMOUS NUMBER THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE IN A CLASS OF A HUNDRED PEOPLE FIVE OF THEM ARE DEALING WITH MAJOR EPRESSION OR HAVE IT SOME POINT LOOK AROUND YOU IN ANY ENVIRONMENT AND YOU CAN BE SURE THAT A GOOD PORTION OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOUR SURROUNDED BY IS IMPACTED BY DEPRESSION OR WILL BE AT SOME POINT SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE REALLY HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THAT WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT IS THE NUMBER FOR CAUSE OF DISABILITY A LOT OF PEOPLE MISS WORK MISSSCHOOL AND BEFORE THEN LIKELY PERFORM POORLY IN WORK OR SCHOOL DO TO MAJOR DEPRESSION NOW THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS CHALLENGE IN HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT DEPRESSION AND IT RELATES DIRECTLY TO THE CHALLENGES IN DIAGNOSING DEPRESSION EARLIER I DID AN EPISODE WITH DOCTOR CARL DICEROTH WHO IS INDEED A A MEDICAL DOCTOR AND A PITYS A PSYCHIOTRIST AND HE MADE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS THAT THE FIELD OF PSYPSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOLOGY ARE CONFRONTED WITH A CHALLENGE WHICH IS THERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THE STUFF THAT'S IN ARE BRAINS THAT DEEP TO OR SKULLS WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT WITHOUT BRAIN IMAGING AND ELECTRODES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SOME ONE JUST COMES INTO THE OFFICE AND THE DISECTION TOOL FOR DEPRESSION SO TO SPEAK IS LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF SOMEBODY HAS DEPRESSION OR NOT WE HAVE TO USE LANGUAGE HOW THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS ALSO HOW THEY CARRY THEIR BODY ALSO SOME GENERAL PATTERNS OF HEALTH SO LET'S TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION THE WAY THAT CLINITIONS TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION BECAUSE ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THAT WE USE THE WORD DEPRESSION LOOSELY A LODPUO S EY AH YOU KNOW I'M SO DEPRESSED I DIDN'T GET THIS JOB ORE I'M SO DEPRESSED I JUST OWN I HAD A REALLY ROUGH WEAK OR I'M EXHAUSTED I'M SO DEPRESSED OR I'M SO DEPRESSED I THOUGHT I WAS CON GO ON VACATION AND THAN THEY CANCEL THE FLIGHT EH THAT IS NOT CLINICAL DEPRESSION THAT'S CALLED BEING BUMMED OUT BEING SAD OR DISAPPOINTED NOW THAT PERSON MIGHT BE DEPRESSED BUT CLINICAL DEPRESSION ACTUALLY HAS SOME VERY SPECIFIC CRITERIA AND THOSE CRITERIA ARE MAINLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE PRESENCE OF CERTAIN THINGS AND THE ABSENCE OF A FEW PARTICULAR THINGS S LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE PRESENT IN SOMEBODY THAT HAS MAJE YOUR DEPRESSION FIRST OF ALL THERE TENDS TO BE A LOT OF GRIEF THERE TENDS TO BE A LOT OF SADNESS THAT'S NO SUPPRISE THE THRESHOLD TO CRY IS OFTEN A SIGNATURE OF DEPRESSION NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IF YOU CRY EASILY THAT YOU'RE DEPRESSED SOME PEOPLE PRY MORE EASILY THAN OTHERS BUT IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO TYPICALLY DIDN'T CRY EASILY AND SUDDENLY YOU FIND YOURSELF CRYING VERY EASILY THAT COULD BE A SIGN OF DEPRESSION AND I WANTO EMPHASIZE COULD THERE'S ALSO THIS THING THAT WE CALL ANHEDONIA A GENERAL LACK OF ABILITY TO ENJOY THINGS THINGS THAT TYPICALLY OR PREVIOUSLY WE ENJOYED THINGS LIKE FOOD THINGS LIKE SEX THINGS LIKE EXERCISED THINGS LIKE SOCIAL GATHERINGS A KIND OF LACK OF ENJOYMENT FROM THOSE THINGS SOMETIMES THAT LACK OF ENJOYMENT IS SAD AND SOMETIMES IS JUST FLAT IT'S JUST KIND OF NEUTRAL IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING THERE IT'S LIKE BLAND FOOD IT'S LIKE  THESE EXPERIENCES OR ANALOGOUS TO BIGHTING INTO YOUR FAVORITE ARTICLE OF FOOD AND IT JUST NOT TASTING VERY GOOD IT ISN'T TASTE LIKE ANYTHING AT ALL AND THAT'S A COMMON SYMPTOM OF MAJEYOUR DEPRESSION THE OTHER ONE IS GUILT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION WILL FEEL VERY GUILTY ABOUT THINGS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PASTD OR THEY'LL JUST GENERALLY FEEL BADLY ABOUT THEM SELVES AND WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE MORE SERIOUS SYMPTOMOLOGY SEEM IN DEPRESSION SOMETIMES THINGS LIKE SELF HARM MUTILATION OR EVEN SUICIDE BUT FOR THE TIME BEING WE WANT A FRAME UP ANTEDONIA THIS LACK OF ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OR EXPERIENCED PLEASURE A KIND OF A FLAT AFFECT AS IT'S CALLED SOMETIMES EVEN DELUSIONAL THINKING NEGATIVE DELUSIONAL THINKING AND IN PARTICULAR ANTI SELF COMFABULATION WHAT IS ANTI SELF CONFABULATION WILL FSWELL CONFABULATION IS AN INCREDIBLE ASPECT OF OUR MIND IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM YOU SOMETIMES SEE OTHER FORMS OF CONFABULATION IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEMORY DEFICITS EITHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE BRAINDAMAGE OR THEY HAVE AGRULATED DOMENSHA A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS WOULD BE SOME ONE WITH AGE RELATED DOMENSHA SOMETIMES WILL FIND THEMSELVES IN A LOCATION IN THE HOUSE AND NOT KNOW HOW THEY GOT THERE AND IF YOU ASK THEM WHATARE YOU DOING HERE THEY WILL CREATE THESE ELABORATE STORIES OH YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING ABOUT GOING TO SHOPPING TO DAY AND I WAS A YOU KNOWNT OI WAS GOING TO TAKE THE BOSS AND THEN I WAS GOING DO TH EY CREATE THESE ELABORATE STORIES THEY CONFABULATE AND YET THAT PERSON HASN'T LEFT THE HOUSE IN WEEKS AND THAT PERSON DOES NOVE A DRIVER'S LIZE SENSENSE SO THE'REREALY JUST CREATING THE STUFF THEY'RE NOT LYING TO GET OUT OF ANYTHING THEY'RE CONFABULANCES IF A BRAIN CIRCUIT THAT WRITE STORIES JUST STARTS GENERATING CONTENT IN MAJOR DEPRESSION THERE'S OFTEN A STATE OF DELUSIONILL ANTI SELF CONFABULATION WHERE THE CONFABULATIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY OR COMPLETELY LINK TO REALITY BUT THEY ARE ONES THAT MAKE THE SELF THE PERSON DESCRIBING THEM SEEM SICK OR IN SOME WAY NOT WELL A GOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO EXPERIENCES A PHYSICAL INJURY PERHAPS MAYBE THEY BREAK THEIR ANKLE MAY BES AN ATHLEE AND THEY ALSO HAPPEN TO BECOME DEPRESSED AND YOU'LL TALK TO THEM YOU SAY HOWR THINGS GOING HOWS YOU'RE REHAVE THEM O IT'SO KAY AND OH NO I'M JUST I FEEL LIK CAM GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER BY THE DAY I'M JUST NOT PERFORMING WELL AND THEN YOU'LL TALK TO THE PERSON THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEIRE CONESIOLOGIST OR WHOEVER THAT THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST AS THEY'LL SAY NOW THEIRE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPROVING AND I TELL THEM THEY'RE IMPROVING BUT SOMEHOW THEY'RE NOT HEY'RE NOT SEEING THAT IMPROVEMENT THEY'RE NOT REGISTERING THAT IMPROVEMENT YOU NOTICE THAT SOMETIMES IT SUBTLE AND SOMETIMES IT'S SEVERE BUT THEY'LL TART CONFABULATING YOU'LL SAY ACTUALY HARD YOU'RE DOING MUCH BETTER YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING BETTER YOU YOU TAKING MULTIPLE TRIPS AROUND THE BUILDING NOW BEFORE YOU COULD BARELY GET OUT OF BED AND THEY'LL SAY YEA WELL BASICALLY YOU KNOW THEY CHANGE SOME THINGS ABOUT THE OF ABOUT THE PARKING LOT THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO MOVE AROUND SO IT'S NOT REALLY ME AND THESE ARENT PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST EXPLAINING AWAY THEIR YOU KOW THEIRE ACCOMPLISHMENTS CAUSE THEIRE THEY'RE TRYING TO YUNO BRUSH OFF PRAISE THEY ARE VIEWING THEMSELVES AND THEY ARE CONFABULATING ACCORDING TO A VIEW THAT IS VERY SELF DEPRECATING TO THE POINT WHERE IT DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH REALITY IT'S NOT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SEE AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT MATCHED UP WITH REALITY AND THAT'S A SYMPTOM OF DEPRESSION THAT I THINK WE DON'T OFTEN THINK ABOUT ORE CONCEPTIOALIZE ENOUGH SO IT'S NOT JUST TELLING PEOPLE OH YEH YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS IT SEEMS EVERYTHINGS BAD THESE PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVE THAT AND IT BECOMES DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY SO I'S IF THEIR SORT OF SINKING INTO A PIT AND TEY'R LOSING TOUCH WITH TE REALITIES OF THE WORLD INCLUDING DATA ABOUT THEMSELVES THEYI'RE ABILITY TO MOVE AND GET AROUND FOR EXAMPLE IN THE A PARTICULAR INSTANCE THAT I USED AES AN EXAMPLE BUT THEI'R RE OTHERS AS WELL THE OTHER COMMON SYMPTOMOLOGY OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IS WHAT THEY CALL VEGETATIVE SYMPTEMS OCA SO VEGETATIVE SYMPTEMS ARE SYMPTEMS THAT OCCUR WITHOUT ANY THINKING WITHOUT ANY DOING OR WITHOUT ANY CONFABULATION THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR COR PHYSIOLOGY THE WORD VEGETATIVE YOUMIGHT KNOW A SOUNDS LIKE VEGETABLE IT ACTUALY RELATES TO WHAT A SYSTEM IN THE BODY THAT NOWADAYS IS MORE COMMONLY CALLED THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE VEGETATIVE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HISTORICALLY WERE CONSIDERED OR ONE IND THE SAME AND IT  RELATES TO THINGS LIKE THE STRESS RESPONSE OR TO OUR ABILITYES A SLEEP SO VEGETATIVE SYMPTOMS BE THINGS LIKE CONSTANTLY BEING EXHAUSTED THE PERSON JUST FEELS EXHAUSTED IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY EXERCISE TOO MUCH IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF A LIFE EVENT IT COULD BE BUT THEYRE JUST WORN OUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY THEY ONCE HAD SO IT'S NOT IN THEIR HEADS IT'S PROBABLY AND NOW I THINK WE HAVE GOOD DATA TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING OFF SOMETHING IS DESERUPTED IN THE AUTONOMIC OR SO CLLED VEGETATIVE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ONE OF THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS OF PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION ONE OF THE SIGNS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IS EARLY WAKING AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FALL BACK O SLEEP DESPITE BEING EXHAUSTED SO WAKING UP AT THREE A M OR FOUR A M OR FIVE A M JUST SPONTANEOUSLY AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP NOW ONE EMPHASIZE THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN FOR OTHER REASONS AS WELL BUT IT IS A COMMON SYMPTOM OR WARNING SIGN OF MAJOR DEPRESSION SO LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT SLEEP AND DEPRESSION IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP IS DESRUPTED IN DEPRESSION WHAT'S THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP HAVE DONE ENTIRE EPISODES ABOUT THIS BUT VERY BRIEFLY IN TWO SENTENCES ALTHOUGH THEY PROBABLY BE RUN ON SENTENCES EARLY IN THE NIGHT YOU TEN HAVE SLOW WAVE SLEEP MORE THAN REMSLEEP OR RAPIDI MOVEMENT SLEEP AS THE NIGHT GOES ON UTEND HAVE MORE RAPIDIE MOVEMENT SLEEP THAT ARCHITECTURE OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP PRECEDING RAPIDI MOVEMENT SLEEP IS RADICALLY DESRUPTED IN MAJOR DEPRESSION IN ADDITION THE PATTERN OF ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN JURING PARTICULAR PHASES OF SLEEP IS DESRUPTED NOW THIS IS DURING SLEEP SO THIS CAN'T BE THAT PEOPLE ARE CREATING THIS SITUATION FOR THEMSELVES THESE ARE REAL PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNS THAT SOMETHING IS OFF IN THIS SO CALLED AUTONOMIC OR VEGETATIVE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THEN THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT RELATE TO THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT THAT WE NORMALLY THINK OF AS MORE VOLUNTARY IN NATURE AND THESE ARE THINGS LIKE DECREASED APPETITE SO YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT ONE COULD HAVE DECREASED APPETITE BECAUSE OF THE ANTEDONI THE LACK OF PLEASURE FROM FOOD AND IF YOU DON'T ENJOY FOOD THAN YOU MIGHT BE LESS MOTIVATED TO EAT IT THAT MAKES SENSE AS WELL BECAUSE OF THESE DESTRUPTIONS IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THESE VEGETATIVE SYMPTOMS AS THEY'ARE CALLED YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT SOME ONE WOULD HAVE DECREASED APPETITE BECAUSE SOME OF THE HORMONES ASSOCIATED WITH APPETITE HYPROCRETE NORECON AND THINGS OF THAT SORT GRELLIN THAT THOSE WOULD BE DESRUPTED AND IF THOSE NAMES OF HYPROCRETAN ERECTION IN GRELLAND DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO OU DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT WHAT THOSE ARE JUST HORMONES THAT IMPACT WHEN WE EAT WHEN WE FEEL HUNGRY AND WHEN WE CRAVE FOOD MORE AS WELL AS WHEN WE FEEL FULL WE HAVE ENOUGH SO CALLED SATIETY YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THOSE WE DID ENTIRE EPISODES ON EATING AND METABOLISM SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SYMPTOMOLOGY OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IMPACTS US THAT MULTIPLE LEVELS THERE'S THE CONSCIOUS LEVEL OF HOW EXCITED WE ARE GENERALLY WELL THAT'S REDUCED THERE'S GRIEF THERE'S GUILT THERE'S CRYING BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THESE VE GITATIVE THINGS THERE'S DESRUPTIONS AND SLEEP WHICH OF COURSE MAKE EVERYTHING MORE CHALLENGING WHEN WE'RE AWAKE WE KNOW THAT SLEEP IS SO VITAL FOR RESETTING YOU'RE WAKING UP EARLY YOU CAN'T GET BACK TO SLEEP THAT'S IN A RETHAT'S GOING TO ADJUST YOURE AFFECT YOUR EMOTIONS IN NEGATIVE WAYS WE KNOW THIS AND APPETITE IS OFF AND THERE ARE HORMONES THAT GET DESRUPTED SO CORTUS ALL LEVELS ARE INCREASED IN PARTICULAR THERE'S A SIGNATURE PATTERN OF DEPRESSION WHEREBY COURTIS ALL THIS STRESS HORMON THAT NORMALLY IS RELEASED IN A HEALTHY WAY ONLY IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY IT SHIFTED TO LATE IN THE DAY IN FACT A NINE P M PEAK AN CARTUSALL IS ONE OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNATURES OF DEPRESSIVE LIKE STATES IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE BUT'S AN IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE SO THERE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON IN MAJOR DEPRESSION AND BY NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING A GOODNESS THIS IS DREADFUL LIKE THERE'S ALL THIS TERRIBLE STUFF AN INDEED IT IS TERRIBLE IT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO FIND ONESELVES IN A MODE WHERE THINGS FEEL SAD YOU FEEL YGUILTY YOU'RE EXHAUSTED AND OFTENTIMES THERES ALSO AN ASSOCIATION WITH THE ANXIETY SYSTEM SO JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE EXHAUSTED AND LETHARGIC AND THEY DON'T ENJOY THINGS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THERE'S AN ABSENCE OF ANXIETY THERE CAN ALSO BE A LOT OF ANXIETY ABOUT WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN TO ME AND I CAN BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE MY GOALS IN LIFE WILL I EVER GET OUT OF THIS STATE AND SO THINGS REALLY START TO LAYER ON AND IS IF THE SOUNDS DEPRESSING TTO IT IS INDEED DEPRESSING THIS IS REALLY THE PLACE THAT MANY PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES AND IT'S A PIT THAT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO CLIME OUT OF SO LIS JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE UNDERLINE BIOLOGY THAT CREATES THIS CLOUD ARE THIS CONSTELLATION OF SYMPTOMOLOGY I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE VARIOUS TREATMENTS HOW THEY WORK AND WHY THEY WORK IND HOW TO IMPLEMENT THEM WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE UNDERLINE BIOLOGY SO LET'S SPEND A FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF DEPRESSION WHAT'S KNOWN WHAT'S NOT KNOWN BECAUSE IN DOING THAT I THINK YOU'LL GET A MUCH CLEARER PICTURE ABOUT WHY CERTAIN TOOLS WORK TO RELIEVE DEPRESSION AND WHY OTHERS MIGHT NOT SO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EARLY FINDINGS IN THE SEARCH FOR A BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF DEPRESSION WAS THIS FINDING THAT THERE ARE DRUGS THAT RELIEVE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION THOSE DRUGS GENERALLY FALL INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES BUT THE FIRST SET OF ONES THAT WERE DISCOVERED WHERE THE SO CALLED TRYCYCLIC ANTI DEPRESSENCE AND THE M A O INHIBITORS THE MONO AMEAN OXIDATES ANHIBITORS YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOMINCLATURE BUT O' MEN GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL SO THAT IF YOU WANT UNDERSTAND IT YOU CAN MOST OF THIS WORK TOOK PLACE IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND CONTINUED WELL UNTIL THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN NEW CLASSES OF DRUGS WERE DISCOVERED AND THESE TRICYCLIC ENTO DEPRESSENS AND THE EMAO INHIBITORS LARGELY WORK KED BY INCREASING LEVELS OF NOR EPINEFFERON IN THE BRAIN AS WELL AS IN THE BODY IN SOME CASES AND THEY WERE DISCOVERED THROUGH A KIND OF ODD SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE DON'T HAV TIME TO GO INTO ALL THE HISTORY BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT THEY WERE DISCOVERED BECAUSE OF THE EXPLORATION FOR DRUGS THAT ALTER BLOOD PRESSURE NOR UP INEFFERAN IMPACTS BLOOD PRESSURE AND DRUGS THAT LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCE LEVELS OF NOR UPINEFFERAN AND THAT IN MANY CASES WAS SHOWN TO LEAD TO DEPRESSION OR DEPRESSIVE LIKE SYMPTOMS AND SO THESE DRUGS THESE TRYCYCLIC DRUGS AND THE EMAOIN HIBITERS ACTUALLY INCREASE NOR UPINERAN AND FRANKLY THEY DO QUITE A GOOD JOB OF RELIEVING SOME IF NOT ALL OF THE SYMPTOMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSURE HOWEVER THEY CARRY WITH THEM MANY SIDE EFFECTS SOME OF THOSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE SIDEAFFECTS RELAID TO BLOOD PRESSURE ITSELF BY INCREASING NOR NOR DRENALINE NOR EPINEFFEREN AS IT'S CALLED YOU RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS THAT CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF OTHER SIDE EFFECTS THE REASON THEY HAVE OTHER SIDE EFFECTS IS BECAUSE THEY IMPACT SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN END IN THE BODY THAT IMPACT THINGS LIKE LEBIDO APPETITE DIGESTION AND OTHERS AND WILL TALK ABOUT EACH OF THOSE IN SEQUENS O C SO THE EXPERIENCE THAT CLINITIONS HAD OF OBSERVING SOME RELIEF FOR DEPRESSION WITH THE TRYSYCLIC AN TO DEPRESSONS AND WITH EMAOIN HIBITERS WAS TERRIFIC BUT THEY WERE ALL THESE SIDE EFFECTS EXIDEAFFECTS THAT PEOPLE REALLY DID NOT LIKE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THESE DRUGS AT ALL O PEOPLE GET DRY MOUTH I MENTION THE LOLIBIDO THEY'D HAVE SLEEP ISSUES APPETITE ISSUES WEIGHT GAIN THEY MADE SOME PEOPLE SO UNCOMFORTABLE THAT THEY PREFERRED NOT TO TAKE THEM EVEN THOUGH WHEN THEY DIDN'T TAKE THEM THEY HAD A WORSENING OR AMAINTENANCE OF THEIR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS A DECATE OR SO LATER THERE WAS THE DISCOVERY OF THE SO CALLED PLEASURE PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN THESE ARE PATHWAYS LITERALLY GROUPS OF NURONS THAT RESIDE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN BUT CONNECT TO ONE ANOTHER SO IT'S A CIRCUIT AND WHEN YOU STIMULATE THESE NURONS WITH CERTAIN BEHAVIORS OR WITH ELECTRICAL STIMULATION IN AN EXPERIMENT BELIEVER NOT THAT'S BEEN DONE IN BOTH ANIMALS IND HUMANS ANIMALS AND HUMANS BECOME VERY VERY MOTIVATED TO GET MORE STIMULATION OF THESE PATHWAYS SO THIS PLEASURE PATHWAY OR THESE CIRCUITS FOR PLESSURE AR VERY WHAT WE CALL REINFORCING IN FACT ANIMALS AND HUMANS WILL WORK HARD TO GET STIMULATION OF THESE BRAIN AREAS EVEN MORE THAN THEY WILL WORK TO OBTAIN SECTS DRUGS OR EVEN IF THEY ARE ADDICTED TO A PARTICULAR DRUG AND THEY ARE IN A STATE OF WITHDRAWL THE ULTIMATE STATE OF CRAVING IF GIVEN A CHOICE A PERSON OR OR IN ANIMAL WILL SELECT TO HAVE STIMULATION OF THIS PLEASURE PATHWAY INSTEAD OF THE DRUG ITSELF AND THAT IS A MAJOR AND SIGNIFICANT FINDING THIS PLEASURE PATHWAY AS ITS SOMETIMES CALL INVOLVES AREAS LIKE THE NUCLES ECUMBENS AND THE VENTURAL TAGMENTAL AREA THESE ARE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE RICH WITH NURONS THAT MAKE DOPOMINE AND IF YOU THINK TO THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION OF ANHEDONIA LACK OF PLEASURE A LACK OF ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE WELL THAT WAS A SMOKING GUN THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DOPOMINE PATHWAY IN DEPRESSION AND INDEED THAT'S THE CASE SO IT'S NOT JUST NORPINEFERON ITS ALSO THE DOPOMINE OR PLEASURE PATHWAY IS SOMEHOW DESRUPTED AND THEN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THERE WAS THE DISCOVERY OF THE SO CALLED ESS S ORSE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOW FAMILIAR WITH THE ESS ES RISE THE SELECTIVE SERATONAN REUPTAKE IN HIBITORS THE ESES ARISE WORKED BY DISTINCT MECHANISMS FROM THE TRISICLIC ANTE DEPRESSENCE AN THE AMAO AND HIBITORS AS THEIR NAME SUGGESTS ES S ORISE SELECTIVE SERETONA REUPTAKN HIBITORS PREVENT CERATONAN FROM BEING WIPED UP FROM THE SYNAPS AFTER TO NURONS TALK TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL HERE SOME VERY BASIC NEURABILOGY ONT A ONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANY NURBIOLOGY YOU'RE GIN TO NOSUM IN ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS NURONS COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER BY SPITTING OUT CHEMICALS INTO THE LITTLE GAP BETWEEN THEM THE LITTLE GAP BETWEEN THEM IS CALLED THE SYNAPS OR BY THE BRITZ THE SINAPS THOSE CHEMICALS BIND TO THE NURON ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND CAUSE CHANGES IN THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF THAT NURON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCINAPS CERATONAN IS ONE SUCH NERO TRANSMITTER OR MORE SPECIFICALLY ITS ANURO MOGULATOR CAN CHANGE THE ACTIVITY OF LARGE GROUPS OF NURONS IN VERY MEANINGFUL WAYS SELECTIVE CERATONAN REUPTAKE INHIBITER MEANS WHEN A PERSON TAKES THIS DRUG SOME OF THOSE DRUGS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE PROZAC OR ZOLOFT THE MORE TYPICAL NAMES OR A MORGINARIC NAMES ARE THINGS LIKE FLUOXITINE WHEN PEOPLE TAKE THOSE MORE CERATONAN HANGS OUT IN THE SYNAPS AND IS ABLE TO BE TAKEN UP BY THE NURON ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE BECAUSE OF THIS SELECTIVE REUPTAKE IN HIBITION IT PREVENTS THE CLEARANCE OF CERATONAN FROM THE SYNAPS AND THEREBY MORE CERATONAN CAN HAVE AN EFFACT SO ESES ARISE DON'T INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CERATONAN IN THE BRAIN THEY CHANGE HOW EFFECTIVE THE ERATONAN THAT'S ALREADY IN THE BRAIN IS AT CHANGING THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS OKE SO THEY DON'T INCREASE CERATONAN THEY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OR THE FUNCTION OF CERATONAN IN THE WAY THAT I JUST DESCRIBED SO THAT WAS MORE THAN FIFTEEN SECONDS BUT NOW YOU UNDERSTAND HOW ESESS ARISE WORK AND I WOULDN' BE TALKING ABOUT ESSESS ARISE IF THEY DIDN'T IN FACT WORK YES THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS WITH ESES ARISE THEY DO CARRY CERTAIN SIDE EFFACTS IN MANY INDIVIDUALS ALSO ABOUT A THIRD OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE ESSESS ARISE DON'T DERIVE ANY BENEFIT IT DOESN'T RELIEVE THEIR SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION HOWEVER FOR THE OTHER TWO THIRDS THERE'S OFTEN A RELIEF OF SOME IF NOT ALL OF THE YMPTOMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION THE PROBLEM IS THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT ACCOMPANY THOSE ESSESSORSES AND SO THESE DAYS ESSESSORISE ARE A COMPLICATED TOPIC IT SORT OF WHAT I WIL CALL A BARBED WIRE TOPIC BECAUSE WE OFTEN HERE ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH THEM BUT THESE DRUGS ALSO HAVE SAVED A LOT OF LIVES THEY AVE ALSO IMPROVED A LOT OF LIVES THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY TAN TO HAVE VARYING EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND SOMETIMES VARYING EFFECTS OVER TIME SO THEY WORK FOR A WHILE THAN THEY WON'T WORK FOR WHILE THEYARE ALSO A LOT OF MYSTERIES ABOUT THE ESSESSORISES AND THOSE MYSTERIES BOTHER PEOPLE WHAT MYSTERIES ARE MY REFERRING TO WELL ESSESSORIES INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CERATONAN OR MORE SPECIFICALLY THEY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF CERATONAN AT THE SYNAPS THAT HAPPENS IMMEDIATELY OR VERY SOON AFTER PEOPLE START TAKING ESESSORISES BUT PEOPLE GENERALLY DON'T START EXPERIENCING ANY RELIEF FROM THEIR SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION IF THEY ARE GOING EXPERIENCED THEM AT ALL UNTIL ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER THEY START TAKING THESE DRUGS SO THERE SOMETHING GOING ON THERE THAT'S NOT CLEAR ONE IDEA IS THAT THE ESSESSORISE ACTUALLY CAN IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION OR EVEN REMOVE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION THROUGH SO CALLED NURO PLASTICITY BY CHANGING THE WAY THAT NURL SARCUITS FUNCTION AND THERE ARE MANY STUDIES ON THIS BUT THE MAIN CATEGORIES OF STUDIES ON ECESSARIZE THAT RELATE TO NEURAL PLASTICITY FALL INTO TWO CAMPS ONE IS THE WAYS IN WHICH ESSESSORISE MIGHT AND ON EMPISIZE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TRIGGER THE PRODUCTION OF MORE NURONS IN THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS CALLED THE DENTIC GIRIS AND OTHERS THAT IMPACT MEMORY THIS IS IMPORTANT WERE ION COME BACK TO MEMORY THE OTHER IS THAT THE ESSESSORISE HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC STUDIES TO REOPEN CRITICAL PERIODS OF PLASTICITY OU JUS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED ONE OF THOSE STUDIES WAS A STUDY DONE BY LOMERTO MAPHES GROUP IN PISA THAT EXPLORED BRAIN PLASTICITY THAT'S KNOWN TO BE PRESENT IN YOUNG ANIMALS AND DISAPPEAR IN OLDER ANIMALS THIS IS ALSO TRUE IN HUMANS THE YOUNGER HUMANS HAVE A FAR MORE PLASTIC BRAIN CAN CHANGE IN MANY MORE WAYS MORE EASILY THAN CAN THE OLDER BRAIN AND WHAT THEY SHOWED WAS THAT FLUOXITINE PROSAC GIVEN TO ADULT ANIMALS CAN REOPEN THIS INCREDIBLE PERIOD OF PLASTICITY CAN ALLOW MORE PLASTICITY TO OCCUR I WAS INTERESTING AM AND IT'S PURELY THROUGH INCREASES IN CERATONAN TRANSMISSION AND THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES SHOWING THAT FLUOXITINE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NEW NURONS THAT ARE BORN INTO THE ADULT BRAIN SO CALLED NEURO GENISIS THE PRODUCTION OF NEW NURONS SO IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE MAJOR CHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN NOR UPAN EFFERAN DOPENING AND CERATONAN THAT RELATE TO AND CAN ADJUST THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND THOSE ACTIY CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SEPARATE CATEGORIES SO FOR INSTANCE EPINEPERAN IS WER NOR EPANEFERAN IS THOUGHT TO RELATE TO THE SO CALLED PSYCHOMOTOR DEFECTS SOMETIMES CALLED PSYCHO MOTOR RETARDATION THIS IS THE LETHARGY THIS IS THE EXHAUSTION THIS IS THE INABILITY GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING DOPAMINE IS THOUGHT TO RELATE TO THE ANTHEDONIA OR I SHOULD SAY LACK OF DOPAMINE IN DEPRESSIVE PATIENCE IS THOUGHT TO LEAD TO THE ANTEDONIA THE LACK OF ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE AND SERATONAN IS THOUGHT TO RELATE TO THE GRIEF THE GUILT SOME OF THE MORE COGNATIVE OR MORE EMOTIONAL ASPECTS OF DEPRESSION SO WE'VE GOT THE NORPAN EFFERENT SYSTEM RELATED TO ACTIVITY IN ALERTNESS THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM RELATING TO MOTIVATION PLEASURE AND THE ABILITY TO SEEK AND EXPERIENCE PLEASURE AND THEN THE SERATONAN SYSTEM THAT'S RELATED TO GRIEF AN UNFORTUNATELY BRAINS AND ORGANISMS DON'T WORK IN A SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL WAY WHERE YOU JUST SAY OH WHILE THIS PERSONS EXPERIENCING LOT OF GRIEF BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH ON YOU KNOW LETHARGY AND SO LESTIOUS BOOST UP THEIR SERATONENT ON PAPER IT WORKS BUT OFTENTIMES IT DOESN'T WORK CLINICALLY AND THE AN ANOTHER PATIENT YOU MIGHT GET SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T EXPERIENCE PLEASURE BUT THERE KIND OF ANXIOUS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE SLEEPING AND A BUT THEIRE THE'RE JUST MUCH MORE ANXIOUS AND AND FRUSTRATED THAN THAN THEY NORMALLY ARE IN THATAND THEY MEET THE SYMPTEMS OF DEPRESSION WELL YOU MIGHT THINK O WELL DO YOU JUST GIVE THAT PERSON SOME DRUG TO INCREASED DOPAMINE AND EVERYTHING WILL BE BETTER AND INDEED IN SOME CASES THAT'S TRUE THERE ARE DRUGS LIKE WELL BUTRON WHICH FUNCTION MORE SPECIFICALLY ON THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM TO INCREASE DOPOMINE AND THEY ALSO INCREASE IN ORUP AND EFFERENT MANY PEOPLE GET GREAT RELIEF FROM THINGS LIKE WELL BUTRON THEY DON'T REALLY IMPACTD THE CERATONAN SYSTEM SO MUCH AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF THE CERATON NURGIC OR CERATONA RELATED SIDE EFFECTS HOWEVER SOME PEOPLE FEEL FAR TOO ANXIOUS ON THOSE DRUGS SOME PEOPLE GET ADDICTED TO THOSE DRUGS IN IT IN A WAY BECAUSE LOT OF THOSE DRUGS THAT INCREASED DOPAMOU MAKE YOU WANT MORE OF THOSE DRUGS SO YOU START TO REALIZE THAT WHAT MAKES SENSE ON PAPER DOESN'T ALWAYSE MAKE SENSE CLINICALLY AND THIS IS WHY IT'S COMPLICATED AND A E REALLY GOOD PSYCHOLOGIST AND REALLY GOD PSYCHATRIS WILL WORK WITH SOME ONE TO TRIN PULL IN PUSH ON THESE VARIOUS SYSTEMS TO FIND THE COMMINATION OF DRUGS THAT MAY BE OR MAY NOT BE CORRECT FOR THEM THERE'S A FOURTH ASPECT OF THE CHEMISTRY OF DEPRESSION THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND AND THAT'S PAIN WE'VE TALKE ABOUT PAIN ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE BUT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE EPISODE ON PLEASURE AND PAIN SO ONE EMPHASIZE THAT PAIN IS SOMETHING THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN OUR BODY NO SURPRISE THERE AND INJURY A CAUT ET CETERA BUT THAT WE ALSO EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL PAIN AND THOSE SYSTEMS ARE LINKED IN VERY INTRICATE WAYS THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME DATE A SHOWING THAT PAIN RELIEVERS TILE AND ALL ASPER IN THESE SORTS OF THINGS CAN HELP CERTAIN PEOPLE WITH EMOTIONAL PAIN NI'M NOT RECOMMENDING PEOPLE RUN OUT AND TAKE THOSE THINGS FOR EMOTIONAL PAIN BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT SHUN COME AS ANY SURPRISE GIVEN THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE PAIN KILLERS OPIOIDS IN THINGS LIKE THEM TO TRY AND RELIEVE THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN AND AS WE KNOW THOSE DRUGS ARE VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS THEY CAN HELP CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BUT THEY ARE VERY PRONE TO ABUSE AND THEY CAN INDUCE ADDICTION VERY EASILY IN A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE'S A SUBSTANCE THAT'S LITERALLY CALLED SUBSTANCE P THE LETTER P THAT MANUFACTURED BY NURONS IN OUR BRAIN IN BODY WHICH UNDERLIES OUR SENSATION OF PAIN AND INDEED SUBSTANCE P INHIBITERS HAVE BEEN USED TO TREAT DEPRESSION AND IN SOME CASES WORKS A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION ARE HYPER SENSITIVE TO PAIN AND OF COURSE THEY COULD HAVE MULTIPLE THINGS GOING ON THEY COULD HAVE CHRONIC PAIN OR CHRONIC INJURY AND MAJOR DEPRESSION S YOU START TO GET THE CONSTELLATION OF OF THE MANY THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN SO THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY TO DAY ABOUT THE CHEMISTRY UNDER LYING DEPRESSION OR MAJOR DEPRESSION THERE'S A LOT MORE THERE BUT I THINK IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE NORUP IN EFFEREN SYSTEM AND THAT IT RELATES TO SOME OF THESE THINGS LIKE LETHARGY THE PCYCHOMOTOR DEFECTS AS THEY'ARE CALLED DOPOMINE AND HOW IT RELATES TO MOTIVATION AND LACK OF MOTIVATION AND LACK OF DOPENING AND DEPRESSION AND CERETONAN AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO GRIEF AND THAT LOW CERETONEAND CAN LEAD TO EXTREME GRIEF AND SHAME AND HIGH HIGHER CERETONE AN LEVELS CAN SOMETIMES RESTORE A SENSE OF WELL BEING AND SAFETY AND FEELING GOOD ABOUT ONESELF F YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PHYSICAL PAIN IS SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN CERTAIN CASES I THINK YOU WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT DEPRESSION AND ITS UNDERLYING CHEMISTRY THAN MOST ALL PEOPLE OUT THERE AND IF YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE I INVITE YOU TO PURSUE ON SEARCHING THOSE TERMS O FURTHER ON THE INTERNATE AND WILL CERTAINLY GO INTO THEM IN MORE DEPTH BUT THAT REALLY SETS THE STAGE FOR WHERE WE'RE HEADED NEXT SO NEXT I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HORMONES AND HOW THEY RELATE TO DEPRESSION AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT STRESS AND HOW IT RELATES TO DEPRESSION AS WELL AS TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE GYNETICS OR THE PREDISPOSITIONS TO DEPRESSION AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THERE ARE THINKING HAY I WANT THE TOOLS I WANT O NOT TO FIX DEPRESSION I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE FOR THAT I WILL JUST ASK IF YOU HANG IN HERE WITH ME A LOW BIT LONGER NOT ONLY WILL YOU LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT HOW THIS COMPLICATED MOD DISORDER WORKS SOME OF THE MORE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT IT BUT IT WILL ALSO POSITION YOU TO GET A LOT MORE OUT OF THE TOOLS THAT WE WILL DESCRIBE YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION TOT SKIP FORWARD OF COURSE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE HORMONALAND STRESS RELATED ASPECTS OF DEPRESSION SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HORMONES TWENTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE MAJOR DEPRESSION HAVE LOW THIROD HORMONE FIEROID HORMONE IS RELATED TO METABOLISM OFTENTIMES WE THINK ABOUT THIEROID IS ONLY RELATED TO YOU KNOW HAVING A FASTMETABOLISM BUT FIEROID IS RELATED TO ALL FORMS OF METABOLISM INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO SYNTHESIZE NEW TISSUES LIKE PROTINE AND REPAIR INJURIES I DID A WHOLE EPISODE ON THIEROD AND GROWTH HORMONE IF YOU WANT TA CHECK THAT OUT ALL OF THAT IS ARE CIVED AT HUBERMEN LABEDOT COMETS ALL TIME STAMPED ET CETERA YOU CAN FIND ON UTUBAPPLE SPOTIFY ALL THOSE PLACES SO IF YOUR CURIOUS ABOUT THIEROYD HORMON AND GROWTH HORMONE AND YOU WANT TO DO THE DEEP DIVEON THOSE NDYOU AN LEARN HOW TO ALTER THEIR LEVELS USING VERIOUS EPROCHES CHECK THAT OUT BUT TWENTY PER CEND OF PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION ARE HYPO THIRODAL THEY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH THIROID AND THAT LEADS TO LOW ENERGY LOW METABOLISM IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND THERE'S A CONDITION CALLED HACHEMODOS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY LOW THIROID OUTPUT AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO L THE TOOLS RELATE TO THIROD SOMETIMES OF A PCYCHOTRIS WILL PRESCRIBE THIROID MEDICATION TO INCREASE THIROID OUTPUT IN PEOPLE THAT ARE DEPRESSED AND THAT WILL WORK TO RELIEVE THE SYMPTEMS SO THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY A DIRECT PROBLEM OF SERATONEAN DOPENMING AN NORUPAN EFFEREN OR SUBSTANCE BE SOMETIMES IT'S A THIROD PROBLEM SO THERE ARE CERTAIN SITUATIONS ARE CONDITIONS THAT CAN IMPACT THE THIROID HORMONE SYSTEM AND MAKE PEOPLE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEPRESSION OR MAKE A PRE EXISTING DEPRESSION WORSE AND THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE CHILD BIRTH SO IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT WOMEN WHO GIVE BIRTH CAN OFTEN UNDERGO WHAT'S CALL POSTPARDEM DEPRESSION NATUALLY COMES FROM THE R POSTPARTUITION DEPRESSION THEY GIVE BIRTH WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPIER WHAT'S MORE JOYFUL THAN THE BIRTH OF A NEW HEALTHY CHILD AND THEY WILL LAPSE IN TO A DEPRESSION AND THAT'S THOUGHT TO BE HORMONALLY RELATED EITHER DIRECTLY TO THE THIROD SYSTEM OR PERHAPS TO THE CORTIS ALL SUSTEM AS WELL WILL TALK ABOUT CORTISONA MOMENT AS WELL CERTAIN WOMEN DURING CERTAIN PHASES OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCL EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS THAT ARE VERY MUCH LIKE CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND OFTENTIMES ARE DIAGNOSE WITH CLINICAL DEPRESSION APPROPRIATELY AND OF COURSE THE MENSTRAL CYCLES ASSOCIATE WITH SHIFTS IN HORMON LEVELS AS WELL MENIPOSAN AND POSTMEN APOUZLE WOMEN ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MAJOR DEPRESSION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THEY'VE HAD THAT MAJOR DEPRESSION EARLIER IN THEIR LIFE SO THESE ARE THINGS TO BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR AND TO DEFILYN TALK TO A DOCTOR AND GET A BLOOD PANEL THAT HOPEFULLY INCLUDES MEASURES OF THIROID HORMONE AND CORTIS ALL HORMON WHY CORTIS ALL HORMON WELL MORE STRESS IS CORRELATED WITH MORE BOUTS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION ACROSS THE LIFE SPIN HOW MANY BOUTS WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT AS YOU GO FROM HAVING ONE TO TWO TO THREE WELL WHEN YOU HIT FOUR TO FIVE BOUTS OF REALLY INTENSE TO STRESSFUL EPISODES IN LIFE THESE TEND TO BE LONG TERMS STRESSFUL EPISODES YOUR RISK FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION GOES WAY UP SO WHETHER R NOT YOU HAVE A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO DEPRESSION OR NOT ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO TO TRY AND AVOID GETTING DEPRESSED IS TO LEARN TO CONTROL YOUR STRESS SYSTEM TO NOT GO FROM SHORT TERMS STRESS WHICH EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES WE ALL HAVE SHORT TERM STRESSERS TO MEDIUM TERMS STRESS TO LONG TERMS STRESS AND DO NOT HAVE TOO MANY BOUTS OF LONG TERMS STRESSED BECAUSE THAT PROBABILITY OF GETTING DEPRESSED GOES WAYWAY UP AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN NOT JUST IN MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER BUT JUST THROUGHOUT LIFE PEOPLE IN ALL SORTS OF DOMAINS YOUNG AND OLD I'VE SEEN THAT PEOPLE WILL GO THROUGH A VERY INTENTS RELATIONSHIP THAT BREAK A BREAK UP SOMETIMES IT'S THE STAYING TOGETHER THAT STRESSFUL SOMETIMES IT'S A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CAN BE STRESSFUL SOMETIMES IT'S SOME OTHER EVENT AND THEN SOME MONTHS LATER THEY BECOME DEPRESSED AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE STRESS SYSTEM IS ASSOCIATE WITH THE RELEASE OF CORTIS ALL THE CORTIS L SYSTEM CAN DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE WAY THAT THESE DIFFERENT NEURMODULATORS DOPAME NOR UP IN IFFERNANCERATONE AN FUNCTION AND SO THEREIS THIS KIND OF LATEN OR LONGER LASTING IMPACT ON THE SYSTEMS THAT THAT IMPACT MOOD AND WELL BEING SO LEARNING HOW TO CONTROL YOUR STRESSES REALLY K IF YOU'RE NOT DEPRESSED ERE YOURE SOMEBODY THAT HAS NOT LAPSED INTO A DEPRESSION RECENTLY TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR STRESS SYSTEM AND WE DID AN ENTIRE EPISODE ON HOW TO CONQUER STRESS AND THAT INVOLVES DEALING WITH STRESS IN THE SHORT TERM THE MEDIUM TERM AND IN THE LONG TERM IN THEIR LOT A DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT REASONS FOR LEARNING HO TO COWNTER STRESS IN ORDER TO OFFSET DEPRESSION IS THAT THERE IS A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE CARRIED TO BECOME DEPRESSED THER ARE THESE STUDIES NOW OF MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS THESE WERE MAINLY DONE IN NEW ZEALAND BUT THESE STUDIES HAVE NOW BEEN DONE ELSEWHERE LOOKING AT MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO CARRY PARTICULAR COPIES OF GENES WHAT THEY CALL POLLYMORPHISMS IN PARTICULAR OF A GENE CALLED FIVE H T T L P ARE WHICH IS A CERATONAN TRANSPORTER SO THIS IS A GENE THAT CONTROLS OR REGULATES HOW MUCH CERATONAN IS AVAILABLE IN THE BRAIN IF YOU HAVE THIS GENE THIS POLLYMORPHISM IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU WILL BE DEPRESSED BUT IT GREATLY SHIFTS YOUR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DEPRESSION UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS SO I REALISE SOME PEOPLE ARE LISTENING IN THIS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE WATCHING IT ON YOU TOVE SO WHEN TO DESCRIBE THIS IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE LOOKING AT ANY GRAFTS WHAT I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE IS A VERY UM IS A VERY SHALLOW HILL LIKE A LIKE A VERY MELLOW HILL IT'S JUST A RAMP SET IT ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN DEGREES OK WHAT WERE PLODTING THERE IN YOUR MIND IS THAT WITH EACH BOUT OF SERIOUS STRESSE SO THAT COAN BE TRYN TO FINISH A DEGREE OR RELATIONSHIP BREAK UP ERE A A FAMILY MEMBER THAT SICK OR THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE OR A PET WITH EACH BOUT OF STRESS THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE A MAJOR DEPRESSION GOES UP HOWEVER IF YOU CARRY THIS GENE THIS H T T L PARGENE THE STEEPNESS OF THAT CURVE GOES WAY WAY UP OR ITS ACTION MORE LIKE A LINE SUCH THAT YOU NEED FAR FEWER BOUTS OF STRESS IN ORDER TO LAPSE INTO A MAJOR DEPRESSION K SO IF THE TYPICAL PERSON WHO DOESN'T CARRY THIS POLLYMORPHISM HAS TO EXPERIENCE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE BOUTS OF STRESS BEFORE THEY LAPSE INTO A DEPRESSION SOMEBODY WITH THIS GENE IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING DEPRESSION AFTER JUST ONE BOUT OR TWO BOUTSE OF INTENSE STRESS  SO THAT'S HOW THESE GENES WORK THEY DON'T PREORDANE OR DETERMINE YOU TO BE DEPRESSED THEY RAISE A SUSCEPTIBILITY AND MANY AN GENES MANY THINGS RELATED TO HERITABILITY IN GENERAL WORK IN THAT WAY AND WE KNOW THERE'S A STRONG GYNETIC COCOMPONENT TO DEPRESSION HOW TO WE KNOW WELL IN WHAT ARE CALLED CONCORDENT MNOSIGOTIC TWINS SO THESE WOULD BE IDENTICAL TWINS AND THEY CAN EITHER BE IN ONE BIOLOGICAL SACK OR TWO BIOLOGICAL SACTS WHILE IN UTERO WHAT'S CALLED MONOCOREONIC OR DICOREONIC WELL TYPICALLY IT'S MONOCORYONIC AND IDENTICAL TWINS FOR WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWINS GOES ON TO HAVE MAJOR DEPRESSION THERE'S A FIFTY PER CENT PROBABILITY THAT THE OTHER ONE WILL HAVE MAJOR DEPRESSION SO IT'S NOT A HUNDRED PER CENT IT'S NOT A HUNDER PER CENT INHERITED  NOT A HARD PER S ENT GUNETIC S YOU MIGHT SAY BUT THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER PREDISPOSITION FOR DEPRESSION WHEREAS IN FRATERNAL TWINS THAT NUMBER DROPS AND IN SIBLINGS THAT NMBER DROPS TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT AND IN HALF SIBLINGS IT'S ABOUT TEN PER CENT THE NUMBERS VERY FROM STUDY TO STUDY BUT BASICALLY THE MORE CLOSELY RELATED YOU ARE TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS MAJOR DEPRESSION THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT YOU WILL ALSO GET MAJOR DEPRESSION AND THEREFORE IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT MAJOR DEPRESSION THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO LEARN TO MITIGATE STRESS BECAUSE STRESS IS THE MAJOR FACTOR THAT CAN TRIGGER ONE OF THESE DEPRESSIVE EPISODES SO COVERED A LOT RELATED TO THE STRESS AND THE HORMONES AND THE NRCHEMISTRY OF DEPRESSION IN FEST I THINK THIS DEPROBABLY THE DEEPEST I'VE EVER GONE INTO THE BIOLOGY OF ANY TOPIC ON THIS POTGAS BEFORE GETTING TO ANY SPECIFIC TOOLS I MENTION THAT LEARNING HOW TO MITIGATE STRESS AND DEOISTRESS LEARNING HOW TO MEASURE AND ADJUST YOUR THIROTORMON THOSE MIGHT BE USEFUL BUT NEXT I LIKE TO TURN TO SOME VERY SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT PEOPLE WHO BOTH HAVE DEPRESSION OR WHO ARE PRONE TO DEPRESSION AS WELL AS PEOPLEWHO DON'T HAVE DEPRESSION AND SIMPLY WANT O MAINTAIN A GOOD MOOD WHO WANT TO MAINTAIN A POSITIVE AFFECT AND PURSUIT OF THINGS IN LIFE WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TURNS OUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AND ALL OF THE BIOLOGY THAT UNDER LIES UTILITY OF THOSE THINGS MEANING THE REASONS THOSE THINGS WORK WILL NOW MAKE CENSE TO YOU BECAUSE THEY ADJUST THINGS LIKE CERETONAN AND DOPENING AND THEY ADJUST THEM THROUGH VERY SPECIFIC PATHWAYS I KNOW FOR MANY PEOPLE LEARNING ABOUT MECHANISM IS KIND OF GRUELING I REALIZE THIS POTGAS ISN'T NECESSARILY ONE THAT YOU CAN LISTEN TO PASSIVELY WHILE DOING OTHER THINGS ALTHOUGH I WOULD HOPE THAT A YOU COULD DO THAT AND STILL ENJOY IT AND EXTRACT THE INFORMATION WHY MECHANISM MECHANISM IS SO KEY BECAUSE MECHANISM IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKING IF YOU READ A RECIPE AND YOU CAN FOLLOW A RECIPE YOU OFTEN HERE PEOPLE SAY I CAN I CAN FOLLOW RECIPE THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU HAVE EVERY INGREDIENT IN THAT RECIPE YOU'R GOOD YOU LIKELY CAN MAKE THAT DISH YOU CAN MAKE THAT MEAL HOWEVER IF YOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF THE CHEMISTRY OF WHY SALT HAS TO BE ADDED THIRD AND NOT FIRST OR WHY THE HEAT HAS TO BE ADJUSTED AT A PARTICULAR TIME WELL THEN NOT ONLY CAN YOU FOLLOW A RECIPE BUT THAT ALSO GIVES YOU FLEXIBILITY FOR WHEN SALT ISN'T AVAILABLE OR WHEN YOU WANTO ADJUST THE FLAVOR OF THE DISH OR WHEN YOU WANT TO TRY A NEW DISH ORE YOU WANT TO GET EXPERIMENTAL SO WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND MECHANISM IT PUTS YOU IN A TREMENDOUS PLACE OF POWER TO WORK WITH YOUR SYSTEM SO IT'S NOT JUST PLUG AND SHUG LIKE TAKE TWELVE MELEGRAMS OF THIS YOU EITHER FEEL BETTER OR YOU DON'T YOU CAN REALLY START TO UNDERSTAND HOW PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SUPPLEMENTS NUTRITION BEHAVIORAL TOOLS HOW THOSE THINGS WEAVE TOGETHER TO EITHER WORK FOR YOU OR NOT WORK FOR YOU AND GET YOU TO PATHS OF HEALTHY MIND AND BODY SO LET'S THINK ABOUT WHY ANY TOOL WOOLD WORK TO RELIEVE DEPRESSION E TALKED ABOUT OUT SOME OF THE DRUGS THAT IMPACT THESE DIFFERENT CHEMICAL SYSTEMS MIGHT WORK AND WHY THEY CREATE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THEY CREATE PROBMS ARE MAINLY CREATED BY THE FACT THAT THEY IMPACT LOTS OF SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY SO TAKE A DRUG TO INCREASE TERATONUM BUT THAT CERATONA IS ALSO RELATED NOT JUST A MOOD BUT TO THINGS RELATED TO LIBIDO AND APPETITE AND SO YOU START DESTRUPTING MULTIPL SYSTEMS YOUL THE THING CO BE SAID FOR BEHAVIORAL TOOLS RIGHT THAT ANY BEHAVIORAL TOOL THAT ADJUST THE LEVELS OF A PARTICULAR CHEMICAL OUGHT TO PERHAPS PROVIDE SOME RELIEF FOR SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE THAT IT I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THE PODCASTS WHICH IS IF YU GET INTO A VERY COLD SHOWER OR YOU TAKE AN ICE BATH YOU WILL RELIEF NOR UP IN EFFERAN IN EP IN EFFERON IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT I DON'T THINK ANY ONE CAN REALLY ESCAPE THAT IT'S A KIND OF UNIVERSAL RESPONSE TO BE IN COLD WATER WELL IF SOME ASPECTS OF DEPRESSION ARE RELATED TO LOW LEVELS OF NORUP AND EFFRON WE'LL TAKING COLLD SHOWERS RELIEVE YOUR DEPRESSION PERHAPS IT MIGHT EVEN RELIEVE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THAT DEPRESSION IS IT A CURE WELL THAT'S GUN DEPEND ON THE INDIVIDUAL WELL EXERCISE HOUP WELL IF YOU GO OUT FOR A RUN YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF NORUP AND EFFRAN IN YOUR BODY IF YOU ENJOY THAT RUN IT'S LIKELY THAT YOU'LL INCREASE THE LEVELS OF DOPEMENG AND PROBABLY SERATONAN IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AS WELL WELL THAT CURE YOUR DEPRESSION WELL THERE'RE A LOT OF STUDIES EXPLORING HOW EXERCISE CAN IMPACT DEPRESSION AND INDEED REGULAR EXERCISE IS KNOWN TO BE A PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOUR AGAINST DEPRESSION BUT IT ALSO CAN HELP RELIEVE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION SO YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF WHY WOULD YOU NEED DRUGS AT ALL WHY WOULD THERE BE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR THE NEED FOR SUPPLEMENTATION OR OTHER THINGS TO ALLEVIATE THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AH WELL THAT'S THE DIABOLICAL NATURE OF DEPRESSION WHICH IS IF PEOPLE ARE FAR ENOUGH ALONG IN THIS THING THIS SOMETIMES CALLED DISEASE SOMETIMES CALLED DISORDER BUT MAJOR DEPRESSION OFTENTIMES THEY CAN'T GET THE ENERGY TO EVEN GET UP AND TAKE A BATH OR A SHOWER THEY HAVE NO MODIVATION TO DO IT THEY HAVE NO DESIRE TO GO FOR A RUN SO YOU SAKE COME ON LET'S GO YOU'LL FEEL BETTER I KNOW YOU FEEL BETTER IT GENERATES ALL THESE CHEMICALS IVE HEARD ON THE WHATEVER PODCASTS YOU REM LADPOCAS OR ANOTHER PODCASTS THAT GETTING INTO ACTION DOES ALL THESE THINGS AND THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND TO YOU A PERSON WHOSE NOT EXPERIENCING DEPRES TION THAT PERHAPS COULD JUST SEEM LIKE THE MOST FRUSTRATING AND CONFUSING THING IN THE WORLD BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT THESE CIRCUITS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE TO SOME OF US THE CIRCUITS FOR HAPPINESS FOR PURSUIT OF PLESSURE FOR EXERCISE FOR GETTING INTO COLD SHOWER IF THAT'S YOUR THING THAT THOSE CIRCUTS ARE PRESENT IN ALL PEOPLE BUT FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING MAJOR DEPRESSION AND ARE REALLY IN THE DEPTHS THAT OF THEIR DEPRESSION THEY CAN'T REALLY ACCESS THOSE CIRCUITS IN THE SAME WAY THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION CAN THAT MAKES IT CLEAR IT'S NOT OFFERING AN EXCUSES FOR THEM AND INDEED I THINK THOSE BEHAVIORS WOULD HELP JOLT THEM OUT OF SOME OF THE SYMPTOMOLOGY OF DEPRESSION BUT THERE JUST NOT ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO DEAL WITH DEPRESSION AGAIN ANY TIME YOU ADD A BEHAVIOR OR A TOOL OR A SUPPLEMENT OR OR SUBTRACT A BEHAVIOR TOOL SUPPLEMENT DRUGUITS THAT ARE YOU ABSOLUTE YOULD TALK TO YOUR PHYSICIAN ESPECIALLY FOUR SOMEBODY THAT'S DEALING WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION I WANT A FOCUS ON THE STRESS SYSTEM AND I'M NOT JUST CON TO TELL YOU TO GET SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES AND TO GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP ALTHOUGH I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS IDEALY EVERY DAY TALKED ABOUT THOSE HADNAUSIUM ON THIS PRODCAST THEY WILL HELP YOUR SLEEP THEY WILL HELP YOU ALLEVIATE STRESS I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TOOLS TO DEAL WITHSTRESS IN REAL TIME ET CETERA BUT LET'S LOOCUT DEPRESSION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A DEEPER BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON WHICH IS INFLAMMATION AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THERE'S GROWING EVIDENCE NOW THAT MANY FORMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IF NOT ALL OF THEM RELATE TO EXCESSIVE INFLAMMATION INFLAMMATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE AND WOUND HEALING IS THAT IT IS A POSITIVE ASPECT OF OUR MUNE SYSTEM ARE ABILITY TO COMBAT WOUNDS COMBAT ILLNESSES ET CETERA BUT INFLAMMATION GON UNCHECKED INFLAMMATION THAT LAST TOO LONG OR IS OF TOO HIGH AMPLITUDE MEAN MEANING TOO MANY ANTI IN FLAMMATORY OR INFLAMMATORY CITACINDS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT IN THE BODY IS BAD AND THERE'S DECENT EVIDENCE NOW THAT INFLAMMATION CAN LEAD TO OR EXASCERBATE DEPRESSION AND THAT IF WE WANT TO CONTROL DEPRESSION OR LIMIT OR E LIMINATE DEPRESSION THAT FOCUSING ON REDUCING INFLAMMATION AND ITS ASSOCIATE PATHWAYS IS A REALLY GOOD THING TO DO AND I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD THING FOR EVERYBODY TO DO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION OR NOT AND TO DAY WE'RE DON'T TALK ABOUT EXACTLY HOW DEPRESSION COMES ABOUT THROUGH THE INFLAMMATION PATHWAY SO FIRST OF ALL WHO ARE THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN CREATING CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THEY ARE THE INFLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS THINGS LIKE IEL SIX INTERLUCANSICS THINGS LIKE TOO MER NECROSIS ALPA T AND AFALPA THINGS LIKE SEA REACTIVE PROTINE RIGHT NOT ALL OF THESE ARE CITACHNS YOU HAVE INTERFERONS AND PROSTIGLANDANS AND ALODY CINGS BUT WHEN WE ARE STRESSE CHRONICALLY STRESSED WE GET INFLAMED AR BRAIN AND VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN BECOME INFLAME BECAUSE CERTAIN CLASSES OF CELLS IN PARTICULAR THOSE GLEAL CELLS THE CELLS THAT ARE TYPICALLY THOUGHT TO JUST BE SUPPORT CELLS THOSE CELLS AND THEREBY CHEMISTRY IN THEIR DIALOGUE WITH THE NURONS OF THE BRAIN EMBODY STARTS TO BECOME DISRUPTED I MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT EARLIER I DON'T RECALL BUT I CERTAINLY MENTIONED IT IN AN EARLIER PODCAST THAT A DRENALINE APINEFRAN WHEN ITS RELIESED IN THE BODY DOESN'T CROSS THE BLOOD BRAINBARRIER BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE ABLE TO CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRY WHEN WE ARE STRESS THINGS LIKE THE E TWO PROSTAGLANDENS THOSE CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AND ARE BLOOD AND AR BRAIN THEREFORE OR BRAIN IN OUR BODY CAN COMMUNICATE BECAUSE CERTAIN THINGS CAN PASS THROUGH THIS BARRIER WE CALLD THE B B B OR THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AND ALSO WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE GLIMPHATIC SYSTEM WHICH IS REALLY APPLUMBING SYSTEM THAT LINK THE BRAIN AMBODIES THE LINK BETWEEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE BRAIN WELL THERE IS A SET OF ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO LIMIT INFLAMMATION AND THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN SEVERAL QUALITY PERE REVIEWED STUDIES NOW TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND TO RELIEVE SUM AND IN SOME CASES ALL OF THE SYMPTOMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION ONE OF THOSE APPROACHES IS TO INCREASE AR INTAKE OF SO CALLED E P AS OR ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS THERE'S NOW A VERY LONG LIST OF PAPERS IN QUALITY PUREVIEW JOURNALS SHOWING THAT WHEN PEOPLE IN JEST A CERTAIN LEVEL OF E P A O MEGATHRE FATIACIDS THE RELIEF FROM DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS MATCHES THE ESCESS ARISE THAT'S INCREDIBLE MIGHT THAT ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS COULD RELIEF SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PRESCRIPTION ANTI DEPRESCIDS NOW THIS DOESN'T NESSERLY MEANIOU RUN OFTAND STOPTAKING YOUR INTO DEPRESSENCE IF YOU BEEN PRESCRIBED THAN PLEASE DON'T DO THAT PLEASE TOCT YOUR PHYSICION AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT SOME OF THESE SAME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT INCREASING OR INTAKE OF THESE ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS IN PARTICULAR THE E P A VARIETY OF OMEGATHREES KAN LOWER THE EFFECTIVE DOSE OF THINGS LIKE ASCESSORISE MEANING IF WE REQUIRED A FIFTY MILIGRAM OR FORTY MILIGRAM DOSE OF FLUOXITINE THAT ONE CAN GET BY ON A LOWER DOSE AND THEREBY PERHAPS NOT EXPERIENCE AS MANY OR AS SEVERE SADE EFFECTS BY TAKING OR SUPPLEMENTING WITH E P AS NOW THE THRESHOLD LEVEL SEEMS TO BE ABOUT ONE BRAM A THOUSAND MELIGRAMS OF E P A SO YOU WILL SOMETIMES SEE ON A BOTTL OF CRILLOIL OR FISH OIL OR ANY OTHER SOURCE EVEN YOU KNOW PLANT SOURCE OR OTHER SOURCE OF AVA E P  THAT IT'S A THOUSAND MELIGRAMS AR TWELVE HUNDRED MELIGRAMS BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S MORE THAN A THOUSAND MELIGRAMS OF E P A BECAUSE THE E P A IN PARTICULAR IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE AND AC TUALLY IN EXPLORING SOME OF THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTS OF E PES ON CARDOVASQUE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH CUSE ME AS WELL AS THEIR EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION THERE SOME INTERESTING DOSE DEPENDENT RESPONSES SUCH THAT PEOPLE WHO TOOK ANYWHERE FROM FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO FIVE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF E P ES ACHIEVED A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT BENEFITS AND IN SOME CASES SOME SIDE EFFECTS WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE AND IT DOES SEEM THAT THIS THOUSAND MILIGRAMS IS THE CRITICAL THRESHOLD FOR BENEFITING OR GETTING SOME RELIEF FROM DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS BUT PEOPLE WHO TOOK TWO GRAHMS SEEM TO DO BETTER AND IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH REALM THERE ITS A LITLE MORE COMPLICATED SOME STUDIES POINT TO A VERY POSITIVE EFFECT ON CARDY OF ASCULAR HEALTH BY TAKING INCREASING AMOUNTS OF E P E OTHERS NOT SO MUCH THE CURRENT DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT FOR EVERY GRAHM OF E P E THAT ONE IN GASTERS ABOUT A NINE PER CENT IMPROVEMENT IN CARDVASCULAR HEALTH THE SAME DOSE DEPENDENT IMPROVEMENT ON SYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH ON A IN COMBATING DEPRESSION CAN'T REALLY BE STATED I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THE MORE E P  YOU TAKE THE BETTER YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL SO TO SPEAK I DON'T THINK THE DATUS A POINT TO THAT HOWEVER IT DOES SEEM THAT IF YOU TAKE A GRAHM A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OR TWO THOUSAND MLIGRAMS OF E P E THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME SUBSTANTIAL RELIEF FOR MANY PEOPLE CH EMPASIZE MANY NOT ALL FOR MANY PEOPLE IN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS SO HOW WULD THIS WORK WHILEL TURNS OUT THAT THESE INFLAMMATORY SIDAKINDS THEY IMPACT NERONS AND THE AND THE CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN THAT RELATE TO THINGS LIKE CERATONAN DOPOMINE AN NOROPANEFERON THESE INFLAMMATORY CDAKINDS ACT IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THEY MAINLY ACT TO INHIBIT THE RELEASE OF CERATONAN NOROPAN EPERON IN DOPOMINE OR THE SYNTHESIS OF CERATONAN NOROPAN EPERON IN DOPOMINE AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW E P S CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT THIS PROCESS AND THEN IT POINTS TO A SECOND TOOL WHICH IS THE PROPER UTILIZATION OF EXERCISE TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF DEPRESSION SO NOW YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY HAVING HEALTHY LEVELS OF CERATONAN IS IMPORTANT FOR MAINTAINING HEALTHY MOOD IT'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE ASPECTS OF HAVING HEALTHY MOOD THEREIS ALSO DOPOMINA NORPANEFRON BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE DOPOMINE ALSO CALLED FIVE H T ESSENTIALLY DERIVES FROM A PRECURSER CALLED TRIPTOPHAN TRIP DOFN ARRIVES INTAR SYSTEM THROUGH OUR DIET C TRIP DOFANIS IN AMINO ACID TRIP DOFAN IS FOUND IN TURKEY ITS FOUND IN CARBOHYDRATES AND THAT SHOULD THEREFORE RAISE THE IDEA I WONDER IF ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPRESSED HAVE SUCH AN APPETITE FOR CARBOHYDRATE LAT IN FOOD IS BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET MORE TRIP DOFAN AND THEREFORE MORE CERATONAN AND INDEED THAT'S THE CASE TRIP DOFAN IS EVENTUALLY CONVERTED INTO SERATONAN HOWEVER IF THERE'S EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF INFLAMMATION THESE INFLAMATORY SIDOKINDS CAUSE TRIPDOFAN DONOT BE CONVERTED SO MUCH INTO SERATONAN BUT TO BE DIVERTED DOWN A DIFFERENT PATHWAY THE PATHWAY INVALVE SOME THAT CALLED IDEO EDOLOMINE WHICH CONVERTS TRIP DOFAN INTO CINURINE OK CINURINE ACTUALLY ACTS AS A NEUROTOXIN BY WAY OF CONVERTING INTO SOMETHING CALLED QUINOLINIC ACID OK AND QUINNALINIC ACID IS PRODEPRESSIVE SO THAT SEEMS LIKE A COMPLICATED ABOU CHEMICAL PATHWAY WHAT'S BASELY HAPPENING HERE IS THAT THE TRIP DOFAN THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE MADE INTO SERATONAN UNDER CONDITIONS OF INFLAMMATION IS BEING DIVERTED INTO A NEROTOXIC PATHWAY AND INGESTION OF E PES BECAUSE IT LIMITS THESE INFLAMMATORY SIDOKINES THINGS LIKE IOLSIXE REACTIVE PROTEN ET CETERA KIN CAUSE MORE OF THE TRIP DOFAN THAT ONE INGESSOR HAS IN THEIR BODY TO BE DIVERTED TOWARDS THE SERATONERGIC PATHWAY EXERCISE IT TURNS OUT ALSO HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE TRIPDOFAN TO SERATONAN CONVERSION PATHWAY AND THE WAY IT DOES IT IS REALLY INTERESTING YOU NOW KNOW THAT TRIP TOFAN CAN EITHER BE CONVERT INTO SERATONAN ER CAN BE CONVERT INTO THIS NEUROTOXIN WHICH IS A BAD THING EXERCISE THE ACTIVATION OF THE MUSCLES THROUGH RHYTHMIC REPEATED USE IN PARTICULAR ROBIC EXERCISE BUT ALSO RESISTANCE TRAINING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DO THIS TO SOME EXTENT TENS A SEQUESTER OR SHUTTLE THE CINURING INTO THE MUSCLE SO THAT IT ISN'T CONVERTED INTO THIS NEROTOXIN THAT IS PRODEPRESSION CAYE THEIR A LOT OF STEPS IN THE PATHWAY LEADINGTO DEPRESSION BUT WHAT THIS ESSENTIALY MEANS IS THAT HITTING A CERTAIN THRESHOLD LEVEL OF E PEIAN TAKE WHETHER BY SUPPLEMENTATION WITH FIHOIL OR CRILOIL OR THROUGH SOME PLANT SOURCE IF YOU'RE NOT INTO INGESTING FISHORE CRI OR TRYING TO GET UP ABOVE THAT THOUSAND MILIGRAM THRESHOLD FORE PE BY INGESTING PATICULAR FRUID SOURCES YOU CERTAINLY CAN DO IT THROUGH FOOD YOU DON'T PAP TO SUPPLEMENT BUT IT'S EASIER TO DO A SUPPLEMENTS THAT DOING THAT WILL LIMIT THE INFLAMMATION THAT THAT DIVERTS TRIP TOFAN INTO THIS NEROTOXIC PATHWAY AND EXERCISE AS WELL AUGMENTS THIS CONVERSION OF TRIPTOFAN INTO SERATONAN BECAUSE IT TAKES THIS THING THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY BE A NEUROTOXIN AND IT SEQUESTURES IT IT PULLS IT AWAY SO THAT IT CAN'T ACTUALLY GOHAVE ITS PRODEPRESSIVE E FACTS SO YOU'VE GOT MULTIPL STEPS HERE F IT WERE DESCRIBING TO TOOLS INCREASING A P AND REGULAR EXERCISE AS A WAY OF INCREASING ERATONAN SOMEWHAT INDIRECTLY RITE ITS BY LIMITING THIS BAD PATHWAY TO E PROMOTE THE ACTIVITY OF A GOOD PATHWAY BUT FROM THE DATA THAT ARE PUBLISHED IN QUALITY PURE REUJEURNALS IT REALLY APPEARS THAT THIS INFLAMMATION PATHWAY DOES FUNCTION TO INCREASE DEPRESSION THROUGH THESE PATHWAYS AND SO KNOWING THAT THEIR BEHAVIORAL STEPS AND SUPPLEMENTATION BASE STEPS OR IF YOU PREFER GETTING URE P S FROM TYPICAL FOOD FROM NUTRITIONAL APPROACHES I FIND THAT VER VERY REASSURING THAT THE MECHANISMS ALL CONVERGE ON A COMMON PATHWAY SER ATONENT THAT GIVES ME GREAT PIECE OF MIND THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY HA GO OUT INTO AU NOW GO OUT FOR RUN OR YOU SHOULD GET OUT DOORS EXERCISE OR YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD TAKE FISH OIL R LIKE THE SKAN INAVIANS YO HAVE SKAN INAVIAN FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY ARE KNOWN TO OR I SHOULD SAY THEY ARE QUITE OPEN ABOUT THE FACT THAT DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AN PARTICULAR WHEN DEPRESSION IS MORE LIKELY BUT THROUGHOUT THE ARE REALLY THEY MAKE AN EFFORT DO REGULARLY IN JEST HIGH LEVELS OF E P  EITHER THROUGH IN JEST IN JESTING FATTY FISH AND ITS SKIN I'M NOT PARTICULAR FAN OF INJESTING THE SKIN OF FATTY FISH OR BY SUPPLEMENTING WITH CAUD LIVER OIL OR OTHER TYPES OF FISH OIL SARDINES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SARDINE OILS THEI'RE NUMBER DIFFERENT THINGS OUT THERE THAT ONE COULD USE SO I FIND IT VER VERY REASSURING THAT THERE'S A COMMON BY O CHEMICAL PATHWAY THAT CAN EXPLAIN WHY THESE THINGS NOT JUST WORK BUT WHY THEY SHOULD WORK THEY SHOULD WORK BECAUSE THEY OPERATE IN THE VERY SAME BILE CHEMICAL PATHWAYS THAT AND TO DEPRESSENTS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED TO PEOPLE DO SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU WELL IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO SUFFERS FOM MAJOR DEPRESSION AGAIND DON'T STOP TAKING YOUR PRESCRIBE MEDICATION TALKE YOUR DOCTOR BUT TALK TO THEM PERHAPS ABOUT THE E P S AND EXERCISE AND HOW THESE THINGS CAN IMPINGE ON THE SAME BILE CHEMICAL PATHWAYS IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOIS NOT SUFFERING FROR MAJOR DEPRESSION I STILL THINK THESE PATHWAYS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AN ACTUALLY KNOWING THESE PATHWAYS IS ADDITIONAL MOTIVATION TO GET REGULAR EXERCISE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE GETTING ANYWHERE FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTES TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES PER WEEK OF SO CALLED ZONE TWO CARDIO FOR CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS ZONE TO IS THE KIND OF MELLOWISH CARDIO WHERE YOU CAN SORT OF HOLD A CONVERSATION IF YOU NEEDED TO BUT IT'S LOBIT THOFGH YEUR KCOND OF SUCKING FOR EER LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S GOING TO LIMIT THESE DEPRESSIVE LIKE SYMPTOMS I THINK IN ALL OF US I DON'T THINK THT WE SHOULD THINK OF DEPRESSION AS AS A STRICT THRESHOLD I'M SOMEBODY WHO PERSONALLY HAS MADE THE CHOICE TO TAKE A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF E P  PER DA I DO THAT BY SUPPLEMENTING FISH OIL THERE ARE DE BATE OUT THERE AS TO WHETHER NOT ITS BETTER TO TAKE E P  N D  CH IN PARTICULAR RATIOS AND WHETHER NOT D  CH  CAN IMPACT THE AL D L WHICH IS THE SO CALLED BAD COLESTERALL THAT THAT'S GETTING REALLY DOWN INTO THE WEEDS AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT IN FUTURE EPISODE BUT FOR MYSELF I NOTICE IT A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL POSITIVE EFFECT OF TAKING ANYWHERE FROM A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS TO TWO THOUSAND MLIGRAMS OF E P  PER DAY I DO THAT THROUGH SUPPLEMENTASION AND I DO ON STRIVE TO TRY AN EAT SOME FISH EVEN THOUGH FRANKLY I'VE NEVER LIKE THE THISTO FISH FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL OR PERHAPS A LOT MORE DETAIL INTO THE EFFECTS OF E P  ON DEPRESSION AND IN RELIEVING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE KNITTY GRITTY OF IT I INVITE YOU TO GO TO EXAMINE OT CALM PUT IN DEPR ESSION E P A THEY LIST OFF AND HAVE LINKS TO TWENTY EIGHT STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF E P A ON MAJOR DEPRESSION IF YOU GO TO PUBMED THER A MANY MANY STUDIES ON THIS NOW THAT DATE BACK O SEVERAL DECADES REALLY A I IF YOUR INTERESTED IN THE SPECIFIC OFFACTS OF E P A AS A POSA D A CH A I WANT APPOINT YOU TO OR A PARTICULAR STUDY ENTITLED NOT SURPRISINGLY E P  BUT NOT D A H  APPEARS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EFFICACY OF OMEGATHRE LONGCHANE POLYON SATURATED FADIAS ITD SUPPLEMENTATION IN DEPRESSION EVIDENCE FROM A METANALYSIS OF RANOMIZE CONTROL TRIALS THIS IS A REALLY WONDERFUL PAPER THE AUTHOR IS JULIAN MARTINS M A R T I ANS WAS PUBLISHIN TWO THOUSAND IN NINE WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS STUDY IN THE CAPTION THAT STUDIES REALLY THE ONE THAT AT LEAST TO ME POINTS TO WHY E P A IN PARTICULAR IS WHAT'S EFFECTIVE AND THAT WHETHER NOT D A CH A IS PROBLEMATIC OR NOT IS A SEPARATE ISSUE BUT IT'S REALLY THE E P A THAT ONE WANTS TO HIT A CERTAIN THRESHOLD LEVEL OF IF ONE'S GOAL IS TO GET RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION OR TO KP DEPRESSION AT BAY BY KEEPING MOOD ELEVATED WHICH IS WHY I TAKE A IDOS P  SO WE'VE GOT E P A WE GOT EXERCISE NOW YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK TO A JUST MOOD NOW I WANT A TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST FOR ME WAS QUITE SURPRISING WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT IT FORSAKE OF TREATMENT OF MOOD DISORDERS AND THAT'S CREATNE CRETINE HAS A NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THROUGHOUT THE BOTY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTO RESISTANCE TRAINING OM AND ACTUALLY FOR THOSE OF YOU THET ARE INTO ENDURANCE TRAINING AS WELL CREATINE AS ACHIEVED A LOT OF POPULARITY A IN RECENT EARS BECAUSE SUPPLEMENTATION WITH CREATINE CAN DRAW MORE WATER INTO MUSCLES AND CAN INCREASE POWER OUTPUT FROM MUSCLES OM SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT DOES INDEED WORK A THERE HAVE BEEN DEBATES ABOUT WHETHER NOT IT'S ONHEALTHY FOR THE KIDNEY IS TO TAKE LONG TERM CREATING SUPPLEMENTATION AT HIDOSES AND I INVITE YOU TO GO DOWN THAT RABBIT WHOLE I THINK MOST PEOPLE NOW ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE NOT ALL BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE LODOSE CREATING SUPPLEMENTATION OF ANYWHERE FROM ONE GRAHAM TO FIVE GRAHAMS PER DAY CAN HAVE A NUMBER OF POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE PEOPLE WITH KIDNEY ISSUES ET CETERA NEED TO BE ESPECIALLY CAUTIOUS BUT CRETING IS INTERESTING FOR THAT PURPOSE HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO A SO CALLED PHOSPHO CREATING SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN AND THAT PHOSPHO CREATING SYSTEM HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN NURONS HAN THESE OTHER CELL TYPES CALLED GLEA AND GLEA COMPRISE NON SEVERAL CELL TYPES MICRULIA ASSERCISES ET CETERA BUT THE PHOSPHROR CRETINE SYSTEM IN THE FOR BRAIN IN PARTICULAR IN THE FRONT OF OUR BRAIN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN REGULATION OF MOOD AND SOME OF THE REWARD PATHWAYS AS WELL AS IN DEPRESSION AND THERE ARE NOW SEVER RAL STUDIES AT LEAST THREE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE PROBABLY MORE BY TIME THIS COMES OUT BECAUE THE'RE COMING OUT VERY QUICKLY NOW AT LEAST THREE QUALITY STUDIES POINTING TO THE FACT THAT CRETING SUPPLEMENTATION DOESN'T JUST HAVE THES POSIVE EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BUT CAN ALSO BE USED AS A WAY TO INCREASE MOOD AND TO IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION THIS HAS BEEN NOW DONE IN SEVERAL DOUBLE BLIND PLACIBO CONTROLLED STUDIES THESE STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT WOMEN HAVE IT LOOKED AT MEN HAVE LOOKED AT ADOLESCENCE SOME OF WHOM WERE TAKING ESCESS OREYES SOME OF WHOM WERE NOT THEY'VE DONE MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCHOPY SO SPECTROSCOPY IS A WAY THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE CONCENTRATIONS OF PARTICULAR COMPOUNDS IN THE BRAIN IN REAL TIME IN HUMANS O IT CAN BE USE FOR OTHER THINGS AS WELL OF COURSE AND BASICLLY WHAT BEEN OBSERVED IS THAT INCREASING THE ACTIVITY OF THE PHOSPHOR CREATING SYSTEM IN THE FOREBRAIN CAN BE BENEFICIAL OR AT LEAST IS CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD SUCH AS TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT'S INVOLVED WITH USING OR SUPPLEMENTING CREATINE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MOOD AND PERHAPS EVEN TREAT DEPRESSION FIRST OF ALL WHEN I TALK ABOUT CREATINE I'M TALKING ABOUT CREATING MONOHYDRATE THERE ARE NUBER DIFFERENT FORMS OF CREATING HERE IMPIM OT CREATING MONOHYDRATE THE AMERICAN JOURNAL PSYCHIATRY IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE PUBLISHED A STUDI WHICH WAS ARANDOMIZED DOUBLE BLIND PLACIBO CONTROL TRIAL ORAL CREATING MONOHYDRATE AND WHAT IT FOUND IS THAT IT COULD AUGMENT OR ENHANCE THE RESPONSE TO A SELECTIVE CERETONE AND REUPTAKE ONHIBITER IN PARTICULAR IN WOMEN WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER SO LIKE E P A CREATINE SUPPLEMENTATION SEEMS TO EITHER LOWER THE REQUIRED DOSE OF ESCESSORI THAT'S REQUIRED TO TREAT DEPRESSION OR CAN IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A GIVEN DOSE OF ECESS OR I HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES THAT HAVE LOOKED DIRECTLY AT CREATING SUPPLEMENTATION IN THE ABSENCE OF ESSESSORISE AND THOSE ARE INTERESTING AS WELL THEREIS A WONDERFUL AND VERY COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW ON CREATINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSION THAT INCLUDES BEAUTIFUL TABLES OF ALL THE SUBJECTS AND THE DOSAGES ET CETERA IAM NOT IN A READ OFF EVERY LINE AND A EVERY COLUMN IN THAT REVIEW BUT WE WILL PROVIDE LINK TO THAT REVIEW AS WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY STRIKING ABOUT THE LISTS OF STUDIES THAT THEY INCLUDE IS THAT MOST OF THEM USED DOSAGES THAT ARE PRETTY REASONABLE FOR MOST PEOPLE ANYWHERE FROM THREE GRAHAMS TO FIVE GRAHMS SOMETIMES UP TO AS MANY TEN GRAMS PER DAY OF CREATINE MANY OF THESE ALSO WERE SHOWN TO INCREASE ACTIVITY OF THIS PHOSPHOR RETING SYSTEM IN THE FOREBRAIN AND SOME SHOW A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT PHOS PHOR CREATINE SYSTEM AND UT PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN CALLED THE N N N M SCUSE ME D A RECEPTOR N METHEL D ASPIRTATE RECEPTOR THE N M D A RECEPTR IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT EVERY BUDDING NERRAL SCIENTISTS LEARNS ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS THE RECEPTER THAT HAS PARTICULAR ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES THAT MAKE IT A CRITICAL GAIT FOR SO CALLED NERAL PLASTICITY SO IT'S NOT A RECEPTOR THAT'S ACTIVATED IN THE BRAIN TYPICALLY FOR JUST THE FUNCTIONING OF THE BRAIN ON A DATED A BASIS IT'S A RECEPTOR THAT'S ACTIVATED WHEN CIRCUITS ARE GOING TO CHANGE WHEN THEY ARE INSPIRED TO CHANGE BY SOME VERY STRONG STIMULUS MEANING SOME EXPERIENCE OR IN SOME CASES OF DRUG OR IN SOME CASES UM SOMETHING ELSE BUT THE ENM DA RECEPTER IS A KID OF A KEY NODE FOR SHIFTING BRAIN CIRCUITRY AND SO WHILE THE DETAILS AREN'T ENTIRELY CLEAR IT SEEMS THAT CREATINE SUPPLEMENTATION LEADS TO INCREASES IN THE PHOSPHOR CREATINE SYSTEM IN THE FOREBRAIN AND THAT INCREASES IN THE ACTIVITY OF THE FOREBRAIN PHOSPHOR CREATINE SYSTEM RELATE TO CHANGES IN THE WAY THE NM D A RECEPTOR'S FUNCTION AND MAY LEAD TO SOME OF THE PLASTICITY THAT CHANGES IN NARRL CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE THE SHIFT FROM NEGATIVE MOOD AND AFFECT TO POSITIVE MOOD NOW THERE A LOT OF GAPS OS OR YO NOW THEIRE LOT OF LITTLE BOXES ARE BINS IN THE DIAGRAM I JUST LAID OUT FOR YOU AND SOME OF THEM ARE STILL TRULY BLACK BOXES AS WE SAY MEANING WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S IN THEM YET AND MORE MECHANISTIC DATE ARE COMING HOWEVER WHEN YOU LOOK OVER THE DATA IN THIS REVIEWER WHEN I LOOK OVER THE DATE IN THIS REVIEU WE FIND IS THAT THE PRETTY STRIKING PAUSIVE EFFECTS OF CREATINE AND ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING EFFECTS IS THAT CREATINE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE MANIA IN PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY MANIC AND THAT'S INTERESTING WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT BY POLAR DEPRESSION TODAY BUT IT SEEMS THAT CREATINE ELEVATES LEVELS OF ACTIVATION AND CAND OF MOOD OVER ALL ANDYOU COULD SEE WHY THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S ALREADY IN A MANIC PHASE BUT IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY LOW AFFECT AND HAS MAJOR DEPRESSION SO SHOULD YOU SUPPLEMENT WITH CREATINE WELL AS ALWAYS TAUGHT YOUR HEALTH YOUR PROVIDOR BUT IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO IS THINKING ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AND THINGS THAT YOU CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOUR MOOD KEEP DEPRESSION AT BAY MAYBE EVEN SUPPORT OTHER TREATMENTS FOR DEFOR MAJOR DEPRESSION THE CRETING SYSTEM SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL ONE THERE'S AT LEAST STRONG STUDIES AND A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM TO LOOK TO TO DETERMINE WETHER NOT THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU I PERSONALLY TAKE FIVEGRAMS OF CREATINE FOR OTHER REASONS I TAKE IT FOR THE M PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ENHANCING EFFECTS A BUT IT'S KIND OF NICE TO THINK THAT PERHAPS IT'S ALSO HELPING ME IMPROVE MY MOOD THAT' TAE CHOICE THAT I'VE MADE FOR MEISN WITHIN THE MARGINS OF SAFETY FOR ME IN MY LIFE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S RIGHT FOR EVERYBODY BUT I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING AND AGAIN I FIND IT PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THEREIS A LOGICAL BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAY TO SUPPORT THE FINDING THAT IT IMPROVES MOOD IN CAN OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IN SOME CASES OR CAN IMPROVE THE EFFECTS OF ANTIDEPRESSENT MEDICATION IN MANY CASES WHEN I SEE MECHANISM AND I S EFFECTIVENESS AND THE MECHANISM IN THE EFFECTIVENESS MAP TO A LOT OF THE SAME MECHANISMS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT GIVES ME GREAT REASSURANCES THAT THIS IS IN JUST SOME SORT OF MYSTERIOUS PATHWAY OR MYSTERIOUS COMPOUND BY WHICH A CRETINE MIGHT BE WORKING SO NOW WE'VE AN A CLUSTER TOGETHER E P S EXERCISE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO INFLAMMATION CREATINE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO FOREBRAIN FUNCTION AND THE PHOSPHOR CREATINE SYSTEM AND THIS NM D A RECEPTOR ND AS YOU'LL SEE IN A FEW MINUTES THE NM D  RECEPTOR TURNS OUT TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT AND IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAIN NOTES OF ACTION FOR SOME OF THE MORE NOVEL AND EXCITING THERAPEUTICS THEI AR BEING EXPLORED NOW IN PSYCHIATRIC LINICS SO LET'S TALK A LITLEBITE MORE ABOUT THIS N M D A RECEPTOR AND HOW IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE MORE EXPERIMENTAL OR NOVEL THERAPEUTIC COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT O MAJOR DEPRESSION AND THE COMPOUNDS THAT WERE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE ONE IS KEDEMINE WHICH IS GETTING INCREASING INTEREST IN PSYCHIATRIC CLINICS AND IN VARIOUS EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES AND THE OTHER IS P C P BOTH KEDEMINE AND P C P ARE KNOWN DRUGS OF ABUSE FOR MANY YEARS PEOPLE HAVE ABUSED THESE DRUGS GO BY THE STREAT NAMES SPECIAL K ET CETERA AND THEY CREATE DISSOCIATIVE AN ESTHETIC STATES SO DISSOCIATEOF STATES WERE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL AS CLOSELY MESHED WITH THEIR EMOTIONS END THEIR PERCEPTIONS IT'S AN ODD STATE I HERE AND IT'S AN ODD STATE THAT CLINITIONS ARE NOW LEVERAGING FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION WILL TALK ABOUT WHY THAT IS BUT IT'S TALK A LOBIT ABOUT THIS N M D A RECEPTOR AND WHY KEDEMINE AN P C P MIGHT WORK FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION OR HOW THEY EVEN COULD WORK I WANT TO BE VERY DIRECT THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT STILL NEEDS A LOT OF DATA THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME EXCELLENT PAPERS FROM REALLY TERRIFIC GROUPS ONE OF THEM IS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NATURE LAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY O FIRST AUTHOR IS VESUNA SAM VASUNA V  S U N A THE LAST AUTHOR IN THE LEAD ON THE STUDY WAS DOCTOR CARL DISEROT WHO WAS A GUESSED ON THE HURUAN LABPODCAST FEW MONTHS AGO THE WORLD EXPERT IN NERASCIENCIES A PSYCHIATRISTAN THIS PAPER FROM SAN VASUNA AND AND CARL AND COLLEAGUES EXPLORED HOW THESE DISSOCIY OF STATES COME ABOUT AND THEY LOOKED AT THIS BOTH IN ANIMALS AND IN HUMANS AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS A SUNCHY A COMMON MECHANISM WHEREBY A PARTICULAR LAYER OF QUARTEC A YOUR YOUR BRAIN HAS THIS OUTER SHELL OF TISSUE THAT IS CALLED THE NEAL QUARTAX ITS WHERE OUR PERCEPTIONS LIE ITS WHERE OUR ASSOCIATIONS LIE ATS IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT AREA FOR PROCESSING DECISION MAKING AND PLANNING ET CETERA IT'S LITERALLY STACKS OF CELLS AN ONE OF THOSE LAYERS IN THE STACK OF CELLS IS LAY OR FIVE AND THE LAYER FIVE NERONS IN PARTICULAR WHEN INTO A PARTICULAR RHYTHM OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY THIS ONE TO THREE HURTS RHYTHM AFTOR MICE OR HUMANS WERE ADMINISTERED CEDEMINE OR PIEC P THERE WAS ACTIVATION OF A PARTICULAR ARE OF THE BRAIN THIS RETROSPLENIAL QUARTAX AS ITS CALLED AND THE DISSOCIATIVE STATE THAT EMERGED WAS AN INTERESTING ONE AND CLINICALLY WHAT'S DESCRIBED IN THE TRIALS FOR CEDEMINE AND THINGS LIKE IT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPRESSED WILL TAKE CEDEMINE WILL EXPERIENCE A KIND OF SEPARATENESS FROM THEIR GRIEF AN FROM THEIR EMOTIONS AND THAT POSSIBLY THERE'S PLASTICITY THEIRE ACTUALLY SHIFTS IN THE NARRAL CIRCUITRY SUCH THAT THEIR EMOTIONS DON'T WAY ON THEM SO HEAVILY AMUSING VERY LOOSE LANGUAGE YEARE BUT THAT THEY DON'T FEEL AS OVER RIDDEN OR WERE AS BURDEN BY THEIR OWN EMOTIONS AS THEY DID PREVIOUSLY TO THE CEDEMINED THERAPY NOW ABSOLUTELY IN NO WAY SHAPE PERFORM IN MY SUGGESTIONG THAT PEOPLE RUN OUT AND TAKE CEDEMINE IN ORDER TO TREAT THEIR OWN DEPRESSION THESE DRUGS ARE STILL VERY MUCH EXPERIMENTAL ALTHOUGH THEY ARE APPROVED IN CERTAIN CONTAX AT LEAST IN THE US O BY PERSCRIPTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS THAT THESE DESSOCIATIVE STATES SOUND AT LEAST HAT THE OUTSET TO BE MORE OF A SEPARATENESS FROM EVERYTHING IT SOUNDS A LOIBIT LIKE DEPRESSION ITSELF THA SORT OF LIKE A ANTEDONIA AN INTOB INABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE AND THEN T ONE TAKES A DISSOCI OFE ANAESTHETIC AND SOMEHOW IS ABLE TO GET RELIEF BY GETTING EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM IN EXPERIENCE TO ME THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT THAT JUST SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT THESE DRUGS IN THESE RECEPTORS IN THESE PACK PATHWAYS OPERATE THROUGH VERY CRIPTIC MEANS AND WE REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN THAT RELATE TO MOTIVATION AND MOOD AND SO FORTH AND THE RESULTS WITH THESE CEDEMINE TRIALS ARE LOOKING VERY PROMISING IN FACT THERE ARE NUMBER OF TRIALS THAT SHOW THAT A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE CEDEMINE INATHERAPUTICCETING LEGALLY WITH A PSYCHITRIS GUIDING THE EXPERIENCE ARE ABLE TO GET RELIEF FROM THEIR SYMPTOMS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR MANY MANY TREATMENTS WITH THE DRUG JUST HOW MANY TREATMENTS VARIES FROM INDIVIDUAL TO INDIVIDUAL BUT IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE THIS STUFF ON GOING THIS IS REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO T TAP IN TO THIS ENMDA RECEPTOR THAT IS RELATED TO NEURAL PLASTICITY BOTH CENEMINE AND P C P ESSENTIALLY ACT AS ANTAGONISTS WHICH MEANS THEY BLOCK THE ENM D A RECEPTOR THEY DO IT THROUGH DIFFERENT METHODS NON COMPETITIVE AND COMPETIVE FOR YOU CHEMIS AND PHARMOCOLOGISTS OUT THERE LOOK IT UP IF YOU LIKE BUT WHATS THEREFORE EVEN MORE SURPRISING IS THAT EVERY NERRAL SCIENTISTS LEARNS THAT ACTIVATION OF THE ENEMD A RECEPTOR NOT ANTAGONISM ARE BLOCKING OF THE ENEMDY A RECEPTOR LEADS TO CHANGES IN NARAL CIRCUITRY IN VERY PROFOUND WAYS IN FACT EXPERIMENTALLY AND I'VE DONE THESE EXPERIMENTS MYSELF IF YOU WANT TO PREVENT PLASTICITY YOU WANT TO PREVENT IN EXPERIENCE FROM RESHAPING NEURAL CIRCUITRY YOU GIVE AN ENM D A RECEPTOR BLOCKER IVE DONE THAT MANY TIMES IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPERIMENTAL NARL SCIENCE CAREER NOT TO MYSELF OBVIOUSLY BUT IN ON THE COURSE OF DOING EXPERIMENTS SO IT'S STILL A BIT MYSTERIOUS TO ME HOW THIS COULD WORK A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS THIS LAYER FIVE ACTIVATION IS PRETTY INTERESTING WERE IN A COME BACK TO LAY OR FIVE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YET ANOTHER EMERGING TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION WHICH IS SYLICIBIN SO CALE MAGIC MUSHROOMS AND THE EFFECTS OF SYLICIVAN ON LAYOR FIVE NURONS IN THE QUARTEC SO THERE'S A COMMON THEME EMERGING HERE WHICH IS THAT LAYOR FIVE ACTIVITY IN THE QUARTECS MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR REWIRING THE BRAIN IN CERTAIN WAYS THAT CAN LEAD TO RECOVERY OR TO AN ALLEVIATION OF SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IF THIS IS SOUNDING A LITTEBIT VAGUE TO YOU IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS STILL TRULY EXPERIMENTAL AND NEW AND STILL VERY MUCH ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS SO IF IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M MOVING SLOWLY THROUGH THIS AND I BEING EXTRA CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I SAY I YOUR YOU ARE CORRECT YOUR ON YOUR UNTENI ARE CORRECT IN THIS IN THIS CASE I NEVER WANT A MISTEP AND SAY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT THAT'S ESPECIALLY THE CASE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPERIMENTAL THERAPIES IN DRUGS WHICH FORMERLY WERE TAKEN AS DRUGS OF ABUSE WHICH ARE NOW BEING USED AS DRUGS FOR THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT IN THE CLINIC THERE IS AN A VERY INTERESTING STUDY THIS WAS PUBLISH IN SCIENCE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THESE ARE VERY RECENT STUDIES A THE LAST AUTHOR ON THIS IS LISTIN ALI S T O ND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS SUSTAINED RESCUE OF PREFRONTAL CIRCUIT ISFUNCTION BY ANTIDEPRESSAN INDUCED SPINE FORMATION AND HERE WHEN WE HEAR SPINE WERE NOT AN REFERRING TO SPINEAS IN YOUR VERTEBRA RUNNING YOUR SPINAL DOWN YOUR SPINAL COLUM WERE TALGO ABOUT THE SPINES WHICH ARE THESE LITTLE PROTRUSIONS ON NURONS NURONS ARE NOT SMOOTH BY ANY STRETCH IF YOU ZUMIN ON A NURON YOU WARE TO COME TO MY LAB AND LOOK DOWN THE MICROSCOP AT A NURON IN ZUMIN ON IT YOU'D FIND THAT SOME NURONS ARE SMOOTH BUT MOST NARONS HAVE THESE LITTLE PROTRUSIONS AND THOSE LITTLE PROTRUSIONS ARE CALLED SPINES AND THOSE LITTLE SPINY P RETRUSIONS ARE LITTLE SIGHTS WHERE NURONS CAN REACH OUT AND FORM AND RECEIVE NEW SYNAPSES FROM NEIGHBORING NURONS SO THEY INCREASE THE SURFACERY OF A NURON AND ALLOW NEW CONNECTIONS TO BE FORMED IN SO SPINE FORMATION IS SYNONYMOUS WITH NAURO PLASTICITY WHICH IS SYNONYMOUS WITH CHANGES IN CIRCUIT FUNCTION WHICH IS SYNONYMOUS WITH CHANGES IN THE WAYS THAT WE THINK WE FEEL AND WE BEHAVE AND WHAT WAS SHOWN IN THE STUDY IS REALLY INTERESTING WHAT THEY SHOWED IS THAT KETAMINE CAN RELIEVE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS RAPIDLY BY CHANGING OR INCREASING IN THIS CASE THE SPINES ON THESE NURONS IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND IF THAT WORD PREFRONTAL RINGS ABELT WELL NOW YOU REMEMBER THE PHOSPHOCREATINE SYSTEM THE INGESTION OF CREATING MONOHYDRATE AND THE FOREBRAIN ACTIVATION OF THE FOREBRAIN WERE RELATED TO IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER TO RELIEF OR IMPROVEMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTEMS SO ERE TRYING TO CONVERGE ON A PICTURE HERE WHEREBY THESE DRUGS KETAMINE PC P USED IN THE THEREPUTIC CONTEXT MAY BE INCREASING NURO PLASTICITY LITERALLY THE CHANGING OF NAURO CIRCUITS IN THE FOREBRAIN SOMEHOW THROUGH DISOCIATIVE STATES AND I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE TOO MUCH ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT COME ABOUT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SUCH AN AND A RESOUNDING OR REPEATING THEME OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IS THT WHEN YOU TALK TO SOMEBODY AS MAJOR DEPRESSION IT IS A REAL DOWNER AND I'M NOT BEING DISPARAGING OF THOSE PEOPLE BUT IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHO'SE DEPRESSED THEYE ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW EXHAUSTED THEY ARE OR IN REALLY SEVERE CASES THEY ARE NOT EVEN RESPONSIVE AT ALL THEY JUST COME A STAND THE OUNSTARE AT YOU BLANKLY OR THEY FALL ASLEEP IN THEIR TRULY DEPRESSED THEIR SYSTEM IS LOWERED IN TERMS OF ITS ACTIVATION STATE SO I THINK THAT IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE APPLICATION OF DRUGS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO SEPARATE FROM THAT STATE OF NOT CARING OR BEING UNINTERESTED OR UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING IS ASHLY ONE OF THE PATHS TO TREATMENT IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT JUST GETTING PEOPLE PEPPY AND EXCITED AND HAPPY THE ARE ALSO SEEMS TO BE REQUIREMENT FOR GETTING THEM DISTANCED FROM THEIR OWN GRIEF AND THIS BRINGS US BACK TO SOMETHING THAT WE TALK ABOUT WAY BACK TAO THE BEGINNING OF THIS EPISODE WHICH WAS THIS PARTICULAR FEATURE OF THE ANTI SELF CONFABULATION THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IS A REFLECTION THAT I SHOULD SAY FOR THE DEPRESSED PERSON THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IS A REFLECTION OF HOW LIFE IS BAD IN THEIR EXPERIENCES JUST POINT TO THE FACT THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO GET BETTER THIS IS THE COMMON LANGUAGE OF OF DEPRESSION IF TIS VERY DEPRESSING TO HEAR ON ME TALK ABOUT IT IS IT IS HEAVY AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TO HEAR THESE THINGS THAT EVEN HEAVIER OF COURSE FOR SOMEBODY TO EXPERIENCE THEM AND THOSE BELIEFS THOSE PATTERNS OF GUILT AND GRIEF AND ANTEDONIA AND DELUSIONAL ANTI SELF CONFABULATIONS THOSE OF THE THINGS THAT HA VENTUALLY IF THEY GET SEVERE ENOUGH START TO CONVERT INTO THINGS LIKE SELFHARM MUTILATION AND IN THE MOST TRAGIC OF CASES OF COURSE SUICIDE AND SO I THINK WE CAN LOOK TO THESE TREATMENTS SUCH AS CETEMINE AND PC P BUT IN PARTICULAR CEDEMINE AND ITS USE IN THE CLINIC AS WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO GET DISTANCE FROM THE NEGATIVE AFFECT THAT THEY FEEL IS IN JUST INSIDE THEM OR OVERWHELMS THEM BUT THAT FOR THE VERY SEVERELY DEPRESS PERSON THEY FEEL IS THEM AND WE HEAR THAT SOMETIMES YOU ARE NOT YOUR EMOTIONS OW THAT'S A STATEMENT THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A LIBIT CHALLENGE BY MENT YET YES INDEED EMOTIONS ARE NOT UM WHO WE ARE AND THEY ARE STATES THAT WE GO INTO AND OUT OF INCLUDING HAPPINESS AND SADNESS BUT THEY ARE VERY MUCH A PART OF US WHEN WE EXPERIENCE THAT WE DON'T EXPERIENCE THEM AS NEXT TO US AR BEHIND US OR ACROSS THE ROOM FROM US WE EXPERIENCE THEM AS OUR EMOTIONS THEY THEY ARE SO MUCH PART AN PARCEL WITH OUR EXPERIENCE OF OURSELF THAT A STATEMENT LIKE WE AREN'T OUR EMOTIONS IS A VERY HARD STATEMENT TO DIGEST ESPECIALLY FOR THE DEPRESSED PERSON AND SO I THINK THAT THE ENEMDI A RECEPTOR AND ITS CAPACITY TO INDUCE NERALPLACTOSY CIRCUIT CHANGES THE FACT THAT PC P AN CEDEMINE ARE BOTH SHOWING ACTIVE THEATION OF NERL CIRCUITS BY WAY OF SUPPRESSING ACTIVITY THE ENEMDY A RECEPTOR AND SOME OF THE POSITIVE OR EXCITING THEIRAPUTIC OUTCOMES THAT ARE COMING FROM THIS REALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT CETEMINE AND PEC P AND REMOVAL OF NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES OR THE EXPERIENCE OF A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE SORT OF GETTING META THERE BUT THE EXPERIENCE OF A NEGATIVE EXPERIENTS MAY BE AN IMPORTANT PATH BY WHICH PEOPLE TREAT THEIR DEPRESSION ESPECIALLY IN ITS MOST SEVERE FORMS WHERE PEOPLE ARE REVERING TOWARDS SELPHARM MUTILATION AND SUICIDE SO YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A THEME WHICH IS THAT CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF APPROACHES THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR OFFSETTING THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION SUCH AS EXERCISE IN GESTING EPAS REDUCING INFLAMMATION OR EVEN THE ASCESS ORISE FOR INCREASING CERETONAN FOCUS ON CHANGING SOME COR BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION LIKE RAISING TE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL CERETONAN OR REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF INFLAMMATORY CITICINDS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND YET THINGS LIKE CETEMINE FOCUS MORE ON REWIRING CIRCUITRY CHANGING NERAL CIRCUITRY SO THAT IT FUNCTIONS BETTER IN THE IMMEDIATE AND HOPEFULLY IN THE LONG TERM AS WELL AND KEEP PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION IN WHAT THEY CALL REMISSION AWAY FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION ANOTHER CATEGORY OF TREATMENTS THATS BEING ACTIVELY EXPLORED NOW IN LABORATORIES AND IN THE PSYCHAETRY REALM ARE THE PSYCHODELICS AND THAT'S A HUGE CATEGORY OF COMPOUNDS HOWEVER ONE IN PARTICULAR SYLICIBAN IS ONE THETS BEING MOST INTENSELY AND ACTIVELY PURSUED FOR ITS CAPACITY TO TRY MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER I ONE TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THE WORK THAT I AM GOING TO DESCRIBE IS WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN UNIVERSITY SETTINGS UNIVERSIY HOSPITALS BO SCIENTISTS AND PSYCHIATRIS AND THESE ARE CLINICAL STUDIES CLINICAL TRIALS LEADING TO PUREVIEWED DATA AND THOSE OF THE DATA THAT WILL BE DISCUSSING A SOME OF THE MAJOR LUMINARIES IN THIS AREA INCLUDE OF COURSE AR NOT LIMITED TO BUT INCLUDE PEOPLE LIKE MATTHEW JOHNSON WHOISE AT JOHN'S HOPKINS WILL DISCUSS SOME OF HIS WORK NOW AND FORTUNATE TO SAY THAT HE WILL BE COMING ON THE PODCAST AS A GESTO DISSCRIBE THE STUDIES IN A VARIETY OF LABORATORIES WORKING ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PSYCHODELIC COMPOUNDS BUT LET'S FOLCUS ON SYLICIBON FOR ITS CAPACITY TO REWIRE NORL CIRCUITS AND ALLEVIATE DEPRESSION THERE HAVE BEEN ANECDOTAL DATA OR EVIDENCE OVER THE YEARS THAT SCYLICIBON HAS THIS CAPACITY HAD O SYLICIB AN WORK WHILE SYLICIBE AND MAGIC MUSHROOMS AS IT SOMETIMES CALLED MAINLY WORKS ON WHAT'S CALLED THE SERATONE AND FIVE H TWO AY RECEPTOR WITH SOME AFFINITY FOR THE FIVE H TO ONE RECEPTOR WHAT IS THAT MEAN WHILL BASICALLY YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CERETON AND RECEPTORS JUST AS YOU HAVE LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF DOPAMIN RECEPTORS OR OTHER TYPES OR RECEPTORS THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING DIFFERENT RECEPTORS EXPRESSED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY EVEN ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF INDIVIDUAL CELLS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY IS THAT THE SAME COMPOUND SERATONAN CAN HAVE A DIVERSE SET OF EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT CELLS AND TISSUES THIS IS ALSO THE BASIS OF SOME OF THE SIDEPECT PROFILS OF ASSESSARIS BECAUSE MAYBE FOR INSTANCE WE KNOW THAT TAKING PROSACLOXITINE WILL INCREASE SERETONE IN ONE AREA BUT ALSO IN ANOTHER AREA AND THEN THEY WILL GO HAVE DIVERSE EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT BRAIN CIRCITS BECAUSE OF THE VARIETY OF RECEPTORS RECEPTORS ARE JUST LIKE PARKING SLOTS WHERE THE MOLECULE CERATON AND PARKS AND HAS DIFFERENT EFFECTS WELL SYLICIBON INGAGES OR INCREASES SERATONAN TRANSMISSION MEANING IT INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF SERATONAN MAINLY BY ACTING AT THESE FIVE H TO A RECEPTORS BUT WHERE IN THE BRAIN DOES IT HAPPEN IN WHAT ARE THE MAJOR EFFECTS FIRST THILL TALK ABOUT THE MAJOR EFFECTS CAUS I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THE STUDY THAT LIKE TO HIGHLITE IS A FAIRLY RECENT ONE IT WAS PUBLISHIN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN JOURNAL JOURNALSCUSE ME OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION PSYCHIOTRIS O JAMA PSYCHIATRY AND ITS ENTITLED EFFECTS OF SYLICIB AN ASSISTED THERAPE ON MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER A RANDOMIZE CLINICAL TRIAL S AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL STUDY A VERY IMPORTANT STUDY IT INCLUDES SOME OF THE LUMINARIES IN THIS SAREA LIKE MATTHEW JOHNSON PATRIC FINAN ROLAN GRIFFITHS AND OTHERS WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS STUDY IT IS AVAILABLE IN ITS FULL FORM OF AT ZERO COST IF YOU WANT O READ IT ITS COLODIDYTAIL SUMJUSCAN A SUMMARIZE A FEW THINGS BUT BASICALLY WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY A SCREEN FOR PATIENTS TO COME INTO THE CLINIC THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT SUFFERED FROM MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AND ADMINISTERED EITHER ONE OR TWO ROUNDS OF SYLICIBON A THEY USED PARTICULAR DOSAGES THEIR LIST IN THE STUDIES YOU CAN LOOK IT UP IF YOUR REALLY INTEREST IN THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL OM TYPICALLY IT WAS A TWENTY MILEGRAMS PARKILEGRAM OF BODYWEIGHTS O DEPENDS ON BODYWEIGHT OR THIRTY MILEGRAMS OF SILICIBEN PERA SEVENTY KILEGRAMS OF BODYWEIGHT O THEY WERE GIVEN IN CAPSAL FORMS OF PEOPLE WEREN'T EATING THE MUSHROOMS THIS THIS OBVIOUSLY A VERY CONTROLLED STUDY AM EN THEY WANT TO CONTROL THE DOSAGES APPROPRIATELY A THEY RANDOMIZE TO BEGIN THE TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER AN EIGHT WEEK DELAY A THEY HAD ALL THE APPROPRIATE CONTROL GROUPS THAT ONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT'S REALLY STRIKING ABOUT THIS STUDY IS THAT THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MOOD AND AFFECT AND RELIEF FROM DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE SUBJECTS IN TIE STUDY WHO RECEIVED OM THE SILICIBEN TREATMENT AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS FIFTY OR WHETHER NOT IT WAS SEVENTY ONE PER CENT A VARIED ACCORDING TO HOW LONG AFTER THE STUDY THEY MAINTAIN THESE ANTI DEPRESSIVE EFFECTS WHETHER NOT THEY STAYED IN REMISSION FROM THE DEPRESSION BUT THESE ARE ARE REALLY ENORMOUS AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS VERY EXCITING OM AND ARE POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF SILICIBAN VERY SOON BECOMING AY TREATMENT FOUR VARIOUS FORMS OF DEPRESSION INCLUDING MAJOR DEPRESSION NOW OF COURSE THIS IS LIMITED TO THE LABORATORY AT PRESENT THERE ARE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS OF THESE STUDIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TOO WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE HIGHLY TRAINED GUIDES MEANING PEOPLE TO DIRECT PEOPLE THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE AS AM MATTHEW JOHNSON IS TOLD ME THEIR UNI THERE IS THE OCCURRENCE FROM TIME TO TIME OF PEOPLE HAVING SO CALLED BAD TRIPS OF HAVING ANXIETY ATTACKS DURING THE HALLUCINATIONS AND ALL THAT AND THEY HAVE WAYS TO MITIGATE THAT AND DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE THE GUIDES ARE TRAINED THEY HAVE OM ALL THE SORTS OF MEDICAL MONITERING DEVICES FOR HEART RAIT AND TEMPERATURE AND THINGS THAT ONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FOR STUDY LIKE THIS BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY POWERFUL COMPOUNDS I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ANY ELEMENTS OF THE DISCUSSION WITH A MATTHEW JOHNSON BECAUSE IT WILL BE RELEASED IN PODCAST'S FORM REASONABLY SOON HERE THE HUBERMENLAPODCAST BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP AND IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THAT I HAD THAT I THINK PROBABLY MANY OF YOU OR ASKING IS DOES THE EXPERIENCE THAT ONE HAS ON THESE COMPOUNDS MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY GAINS RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION FROM THESE SILICIBEN JOURNEYS OR NOT A IN OTHER WORDS DOES IT MATTER WHT THEY TALK ABOUT DOES IT MATTER WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT DOES IT MATTER IF THEY HAVE A GOOD TRIP OR A BAD TRIP AND A I DON'T T HOLD YOU IN TOO MUCH SUSPENSE I'LL LET MATTHEW PROVIDE THE MORE THOROUGH ANSWER BUT WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THERE ARE SOME COMMON THEMES TO SILICIB AN ADMINISTRATION AND EXPERIENCE THAT LEAD TO RELIEF FROM DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS BUT THEY ARE SUBJECTIVELY EXCUSE ME SUBJECTIVELY VERY VARIED MEANING THAT WHETHER OR NOT T PEOPLE FEEL THEY HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE ARE A BAD EXPERIENCE WHETHER NOT PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR PARENCE OR THOUGHT ABOUT A THE COLOR OF THE CEILING DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE TOO MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON WHETHER R NOT THEY RECEIVE RELIEF DURING THESE STUDIES IN THESE CLINICAL STUDIES SEEMS THEY DIFFERENT PEOPLE CAN HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND STILL RECEIVE BENEFIT AND THAT POINTS TO SOMETHING DEEPER IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THESE DRUGS JIS REALLY WHAT THEY ARE OR REWIRING NAURAL CIRCUITRY IN A COMMON WAY DESPITE A DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE WHILE ON THE DRUG AND THAT ITSELF IS REALLY INTERESTING NI AND IT TAKES US BACK TO A PLACE THAT WE'VE BEEN BEFORE IN THIS DISCUSSION WHICH IS LAYER FIVE OF THE QUARTEC THIS AREA THAT CENEMINE SEEMS TO IMPACT AS WELL BY GENERATING RHYTHMS OF I MENTION ONE TO THREE HURTS ACTIVITY IN LAY OR FIVE OF CERTAIN AREAS OF THE QUARTEC WELL THE FIVE H T ONA RECEPTOR IS KNOWN TO BE ENRICHED IN LAYER FIVE OF THE QUARTEC AND LAYER FIVE OF THE QUARTEC IS A VERY INTERESTING AREA BECAUSE ITS AN AREAN WHICH THERE'S A LOT OF LATERAL CONACTIVITY SO CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS LATERALLY GENERALLY A IS WHAT ALLOWS US TO MERGE DIFFERENT SENSES SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE HEAR A SOUND OFF TO OUR RIGHT OVER HERE WE TURN TO OUR RIGHT A THERE'S A VERY HARD WIRED RESPONSE IN TYPICALLY WE HEAR SOMETHING OFF TO OUR RIGHT WE DON'T LOOK TO OUR LEFT THAT'S HOW HARD WIRED SOME OF THESE CIRCUITS ARE WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAPPENING IS THAT THE ACTIVATION OF THE CERETONAN SYS TEM IN FIVE AGE T ON A RECEPTOR IN LAYER FIVE IS OFFERING UP OR PROVIDING AND EXPERIENCE WHEREBY LAT THE LATERAL CONNECTIONS ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE MUCH MORE BROADLY THAN THEY WOULD NORMALLY NOW THAT ALSO A COULD BE A BAD THING YOU KNOW AND I ASKED A MAT ABOUT THIS YAN THAT SOUNDS CONTISPOKY I DON'T KNOW THAT WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING OFF TO MY RIGHT THAT I WANT O LOOK OFF TO MY LEFT THAT COULD BE HIGHLY MALADAPT IVE ESPECIALLY OF ITS THE CAR COMING AT ME FROM MY RIGHT A THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WHAT'S HAPPENING IT'S NOT REALLY REWIRING THESE DEEPLY REFLECTIVE CIRCUITS IT SOMEHOW REWIRING ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN EVENTS EMOTIONAL EVENTS PAST EVENTS CURRENT EVENTS AND FUTURE EVENTS IN WAYS THAT A LOW PEOPLE TO GET SOME SORT OF RELIEF OR DISTANCE FROM THESE NARRATIVES THESE DEPRESSIVE STORIES ABOUT THEIR PAST AND PRESENT AND ALLOW THEM TO SEE NEW OPPORTUNITY AND OFF TIMISM IN THE FUTURE AN REALLY A FASCINATING THING IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT BUT SIMPLY BY RAMPING UP LATERALITY OF CONNECTIONS MEANING THE CROSS ASSOCIATIONS THAT THINGS COULD EITHER BE REWIRED RANDOMLY IN WAYS THAT DON'T SERVE US OR WOULD PERHAPS JUST CAUSE NO EFFECT AT ALL SO AS YOU THY CAN BE BAD OR NEUTRAL BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE WAY THINGS ARE TURNING OUT AGAIN THESE ARE HIGHLY CONTROLLED STUDIES I DO ONE EMPHASIZE THAT CEDAMINE CYLICIB IN THESE THINGS ARE STILL ILLEGAL MOST ALL PLACES THERE ARE SOME REGIONS AND CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE TH Y ARE LOCALLY DECRIMINALIZED BUT THEY ARE NOT LEGAL THEY ARE STILL ELLEGAL SO WHAT REFERRING TO HERE ARE INDEED CLINICAL STUDIES IN WHICH ON PEOPLE ARE TAKING THEM LEGALLY OM I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY WE WILL SEE A SHIFT IN THE LEGISLATURE AROUND PSYCHODELICSAN IN PARTICULAR SYLICIBON IN THE OM NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE A AND I THINK THAT FOR NOW WHAT WE SHOULD KNOW IS WHAT MAT TOLD ME AND WHAT YOU'LL HEAR FAR MORE ABOUT UM WHICH IS THAT SYLICIBEN THIS ONE ER IN MOST CASES TODOSE TREATMENTS DONE INHIGHLY CLINICAL SETTING CONTROLLE SETTING WITH PATIENTS THAT ARE CAREFULLY SELECTED CAN IN MANY CASES THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE RERECEIVE AND MAINTAIN RELIEF FROM THEIR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS SIMPLY THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY I DID ASK THIM ABOUT MICRODOSING U I MEAN IT SOUND AS IF I A NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE MICRODOSING NOT MICRODOSING MICRODOSING UM AND HIS ANSWER WAS INTERESTING HIS ANSWER WAS THAT THE MICRODOSING EFFACTS DON'T SEEM TO BE NEARLY AS IMPACTFUL AS SOME OF THESE OM WHAT LET'S JUST CALL THEM WHAT THEY ARE THESE KIND OF HIGH AMPLITUDE SESSIONS THAT THERE ARE JUST ONE OR TWO OM THERE ARE SOME STUDIES ON GOING WHERE THEREIS MORE THAN TWO BUT THAT THE MICRODOSING DOESN'T SEEM TO COMPARE TO THESE MACRODOSING OM I MENTION THE DOSAGES BEFORE A THIS TWENTY MILEGRAMS PER SEVENTY KILEGRAMS OR THIRTY MILIGRAMS FOR SEVENTY KILEGRAMS DOSAGES I'M GIVEN COUPLE A GIVEN SEVERAL WEEKS APART SO YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT MICRODOSING ANDOTHER O PSYCHODELICS AND THEIR IMPACT ON A DEPRESSIVE STATES AND MAJOR DEPRESSION IN THE EPISODE WITH MAT BUT FOR THE TIME BEING IT REALLY SEEMS AS IF AGAIN WERE LOOKING AT NERAL PLASTICITY WERE COMING BACK TO LAYER FIVE JUST LIKE WITH KEDEMINE AND PC P WERE HEARING ABOUT LAY OR FIVE OR HEARING ABOUT REWIRING OF CIRCUITRY WERE HEARING ABOUT A DISSOCIATION OR A DISTANCING OF ONESELF FRUM THESE NEGATIVE MOODS AND AFFECS AND NARRATIVES BUT THERE'S A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CEDEMINE WORK AND THE SYLICIBEN WORK WHICH IS THAT IN THE CEDEMINE WORK IT REALLY IS ABOUT DISSOCIATING FROM EXPERIENCE JURING THE SESSION WITH THE PSYCHATRISS WERE AS JURY THE SYLICIBAN JOURNEY ITS REALLY ABOUT IMMERSING ONESELF IN THE EXPERIENCE IND BEING FULLY PRESENT TO THAT EXPERIENCE THAT DOES SEEM TO BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT AND WHAT THE DIFFERENCEIS THERE AND WHY THEY BOTH SEEM TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF FROM DE MAJOR DEPRESSION ISN'NT CLEAR I THINK MOST LIKELY IT TAKES US BACK TO THE FACT THAT THIS THING WE CALL MAJOR DEPRESSION CLEARLY INVOLVES SERATONAN DOPOMIN AND NOR APAN EFERON AND IN SOME INDIVIDUALS THEY MAY BE MORE DEFICIENT IN ONE OR SEVERAL OF THOSE OR ALL OF THOSE WERE AS INOTHER INDIVIDUALS IT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT COLLECTION OF CHEMICALS AND OF COURSE THERE ARE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF OTHER PSYCHODELIC COMPOUNDS THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPLORING FOR TREAT ANT OF MAJOR DEPRESSION BUT REALLY SYLICIBON IS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE THE MOST DATA ON EM DI AMAY HAS MAINLY BEEN EXPLORED IN THE CLINICAL REALM FOR TREATMENT OF TRAMA THERE ARE SOME TRIALS ON GOING FOR TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION BUT THE THE BIG THE BIG BRAK THROUGH SEEM TO BE HAPPENING IN THE REALM OF TROMA TREATMENT THE SO CALLED MAPS GROUP THAT'S DOING THIS AGAIN LEGALLY A AN A CLINICAL SETTING AND THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE STARTING TO DO IT AS WELL AN WE ARE GOING TO DO AN ENTIRE PODCAST EPISODE ABOUT EMDIA MA AND SOME RELATED COMPOUNDS SO I'LL SAVE THAT DISCUSSION FOR THEM ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET FOR THIS PODCAST IS ABOUT DIFFERENT DIETS DIFFERENT REGIMES DIFFERENT NUTRITIONAL PLANS THINGS LIKE KITO KITOGENIC DIET OR VIGAN DIETS OR INTERMIN FASTING OR THE ALMEAT DI THE SO CAL LION DIT ET CETERA A THERE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY INTERESTING DATA RELATING NUTRICIAN AND DIET TO MAJORE DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AND THINK WE JUST NEED TO FRAME THIS BY RETURNING TO SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER WHICH IS THAT THE INGESTION OF CARBOHYDRATES IN PARTICULAR CARBOHYDRATES AND SOME MEATS LIKE TURKEY THAT ARE RICH IN TRIPDIPHAN THIS PRECURSOR TO SERATONAN ARE IN MANY WAYS THE SELF MEDICATING VERSION OF DEPRESSION TREATMENT NOW TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT SAYIG THAT PEOPLE SHOULD USE FOOD TO MEDICATE THEIR DEPRESSION MANY PEOPLE DO THAT REFLECTIVELY HOWEVER THEY REACH FOR CARBOHYDRATE RICH FOODS TO BLUNTH THEIR CORTISALL THAT'S INDEED WHAT IT DOES A BLUNT'S CORT IS ALL WHEN YOU JEST HY CARBOHYDRATE FOODS IN PARTICULAR STARCHY FOODS AND IT DOES INCREASE SERTONAN N PARTICULAR IF ITS A IF THOSE FOODS RATHER OR RICH IN IN THE EMENOACID TRIPTOPHAN NOW INJESTING FOOD IS WONDERFUL AND IMPORTANT AND GREAT BUT INJESTING EXCESSIVE FOODS OF ANY KIND CARBOHYDRATE OR OTHERISE OTHERWISE IS NOT HEALTHY OF COURSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EXPLORATIONS OF WHETHER NOT A VIGAN DIET CAN IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION NOT A LOT OF DATA NOT IMPRESSIVE DATA THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW CONTROLLED STUDIES LOOKING AT THE A CARNIVORE OLL MEAT DIET ON THAT I THINK THERE ARE NOW SOME THAT ARE STARTING TO SPEN UP MEANING THE STUDIES THEIR STERN IS SPEEN UP HOWEVER THE KITOGENICDIE HAS BEEN EXPLORED FOR IT'S ABILITY TO RELIEVE CERTAIN SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION A IN PARTICULAR TO WHAT'S CALLED MAINTAIN EUTHYMIA EUTHYMIA IS THE KIND OF STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN AMANIC EPISODE AND A DEPRESSIVE EPISODE IN A MANIC BY POLAR PERSON WILL RETURN TO THES MORE IN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT IT BASICALLY MANICS HAVE HIGES AND THEY HAVE LOWS BY POLARS EITHER CYCLE BACK AND FORTH REALLY QUICKLY SO RAPID CYCLING BY POLARS OR SLOW PI SOME PEOPLE SO REALLY QUICKLY CAN BE DATO DAY OTHER PEOPLE ITS MONTH THE MONTH OR WEAK TO EAK THEIR GOING HIES AND LOWS AND YOU HEARE ABOUT MANIA AND YOU HER ABOUT DISPHORIA EUTHYMIAIS THAT KIND OF A PLACE IN THE MIDDLE WHERE PEOPLE FEEL NEITHER TOO HIGH NOR TOO LOW AND THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING STUDIES LOOKING AT THE QUEITO JOGENICDIET FROM MAINTAINING UTHIMIA IN MANIC DEPRESSIVES BUT ALSO IN PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WHY WOULD THIS WORK WILL WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE QUITOGENIC DIET WASN'T DISCOVERED SO THAT UN A SELF APPOINTED A NUTRICIAN GEROOS COULD TALK ABOUT IT ON LINE OR SO THAT PEOPLE COULD MAKE MONEY SELLING ANYTHING RELATED TO TO QUITOSIS AND HERE I'M NOT DISPARAGING OF THE QUITOGENTITES HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE THE QUITOE THE QUITOGENIC DIET WAS ACTUALLY SHOWN TO BE MEDICALLY A RELEVANT FOR ITS USE TO TREAT EPILEPSY IT TURNS OUT THAT IN EPILEPSY OR IN PARTICULAR PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY THAT A QUEITOGENIC DIET AND THE SHIFT OF BRAIN METABOLISM TO PREDOMINANTLY ONE IN WHICH QEITONES ARE BEING METABOLIZED RATHER THAN MORE STANDARD GLUCOS TYPEMOTABOLISM CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF EPILEPTIC SEIZURES THAT THESE CHILDREN EXPERIENCE NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT ITS OFTEN THE CASE AND SO YOU TALK TO A NEUROLOGIST WHO R A NER SURGEON WHOSE SPECIALIZED IN A IN A EPILEPSY IN PRETULAPEDIATRIC EPPCY AND THAT THEY'LL TELL YOU THAT SO HE HAVE THE QITOGENIC DIET IN MANY CASES NOT ALL CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE ORTHE TREATMENT HOW HOW IS IT THAT A QITOGENIC DIET REDUCES SEIZURES WELL THE WAY IT REDUCES SEIZURES IS BY INCREASING WHATS CALLED GABA TRANSMISSION GABA IS A SUBSTANCE THAT IS NATURALLY RELEASED IN OUR BRAIN IT'S AN ANHIBITORY NOR TRANSMITTOR MEANING THAT WHEN ITS RELEASED INTO THE CYNAPS IT HAS THE TENDENCY TO REDUCE THE FIRING THE REDUCE THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF THE NEXT NERON OR SETS OF NERONS THEIR VARIOUS COMPOUNDS THE INCREASE GABA IN PARTICULAR GABON THE FOREBRAIN ONE COMIN EXAMPLE WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE ALCOHOL DRINKING A ALCALIC DRINKER TOO WILL NCREASE GABA TRANSMISSION WILL IRONICALLY WILL LOWER OR SOCIAL INIBITIONS BY INCREASING EURNERCHEMICAL INIBISSION IT BASILY SUPPRESSES THE A SELP MONITERING PATHWAYS AND IF PEOPLE DRINK ENOUGH IT WILL SUPPRESS ALL PATHWAYS AND PEOPLE WILL URINATE THEMSELVES AND FALL OVER IT WILL EVENTUALLY INHIBIT ALL SORTS OF PATHWAYS SO THE GABASYSTEM HAS A RICH ARRAY OF EFFACTS ALL OVER THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT ALCOHOL TENDS TO ACTIVATE THE RELEASE OF GABA YOU MIGHT SAY WILL THEN WHY NOT JUST TAKE ALCALL THE SUPPRESS SEIZURES WITHOUT BE A TERRIBLE IDEA BECAUSE THERE TENDS TO BE A REBOUND EXCITABILITY AFTER ALCOHOL STOPS HAVING ITS EFFECTS ON THE GABA RECEPTORS AND SO THEN THERE'S AN EXCITABILITY FOR WHICH AN EPILEPSY WOULD BE TERRIBLE THE REASON WHY THE EPILEPTIC A GDIET IS USEFUL FOR EPILEPSY IS THAT INCREASES THAT WHAT WE CALL THE TONIC LEVEL THE SORT OF THAT THE TIE THE LEVEL OF GABA IN THE BRAIN AND THAT SUPPRESSES SOME OF THE HYPER EXCITABILITY THAT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF EPILEPSY AND THERE ARE OTHER DRUGS FOR INSTANCE THE BENZO DIAZOPINES OM AND THINGS OF THE ZANAX VARIETY VALIUM AND SO FORTH THOSE INCREASE GABATRANSMISSION THOSE DRUGS ALSO HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE AND EDDICTION ET CETERA AND HAT THEIR PROBLEMATIC FOR OTHER REASONS BUT THE KEITOGENIC DIET BY WAY OF INCREASING KEYTONE METABOLISM ARE SHIFTING BRAINS METABOLISM OVER TO KEYTONES TENDS TO MODULATE GABA SUCH THAT GABA IS MORE ACTIVE AND A JUST THES SO CALLED GABAGLUDIMATE BALANCE THIS IS GETTING TECHNICAL BUT GLUDIMATE AS AN EXCITATORY N NERTRANSMITTER GABAS IN HIBATORY NERTRANSMET AND THEIR BALANCE IS VITAL FOR NER PLASTICITY FOR MAINTAINING HEALTHY LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN ET CETERA AND SO THER IS DECENT EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS INPARTICULAR THE PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS THAT ARE REFRACTORY MEANING THEY DON'T RESPOND TO CLASSICAL ANTIDOPRESSENS CAN BENEFIT IT SEEMS FROM THE KEITOGENIC DIET NOW THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION AND FOR WHICH DRUGS HAVE NOT WORK PLEASE TALKED YOUR PSYCHOTRIST I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM ARE UP ON THE LITERATURE ABOUT A THE KEITOGENIC DIETOR THE EPIES AND THE REST YOU KNOW PSYCHATRIS ARE VARY IN TERMS OF HOW INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT LITERATURE ON THEY TEND TO BE BUT THERE ARE MANY EXCELLENT PSYCHATRIS OUT THERE MOST OF THEM IN MY EXPERIENCE ARE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE AVID LEARNERS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WHAT'S NEW IN THIS REALM THEY CALL PSYCHITRY SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT EATING IN A PARTICULAR WAY LOWERING CARBROHYDRATES TO THE POINT WHERE YOU RELYING ON KEITOGENIC METABOLISM IN THE BRAIN NCREASES GABA AND CAN PROVIDE SOME RELIEF FOR FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTEMS AND THAT IN PARTICULAR THAT SEEMS TO HAVE POSIVE EFFACTS IN PEOPLE THAT ARE REFRACTORIOR DON'T RESPOND TO CLASSIC ANTIDEPRESSONS AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE FLUOXITINE ET CETERA I'LL MAKE ONE FINAL POINT ABOUT KEITOGENIC DIETS AND GABA AND DEPRESSION WHICH IS THAT IT'S ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT RESPOND WELL TO THESE DRUGS THAT IMPACT THE PCERATONAN SYSTEM DOPEMIAN SYSTEM OR NOR UP IN EFFERN THE KEITOGENIC DIET THERE MAY IMPROVE THE ABILITY FOR THOSE DRUGS TO WORK AT LOWER DOSAGES WHICH IS REMINISCEN OF WHAT WE SAW WITH THE EPIA SUPPLEMENTATION SO TO DAY WE'VE COVERED WHAT AT LEAST FEELS TO ME LIKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THIS TOPIC OF DEPRESSION IS INDEED AN ENORMOUS TOPIC TO TRY AND GET OUR ARMS AROUND WE TALKED ABOUT THE SYMPTOMOLOGY WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE UNDERLYING NOR CHEMISTRY IN BIOLOGY AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT APPROACHES TO DEAL WITH IT THAT ARE REALLY GROUNDED IN THE NARRO CHEMISTRY AN BIOLOGY I JUST WANT TO RECAP A FEW OF THOSE TOOLS AND WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE FIRST OF ALL WE TALKED ABOUT MAKING THE EFFORT TO NOT OVERWHELM THE PLEASURE SYSTEM THAT MIGHT SEEM C N AR INTUITIVE DO NOT OVERLY SEEK OUT PLEASURE OR ELSE ONE CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN A PLACE OF DEPRESSION I MENTION WAY BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE A YOUNG MAN WHO I KNOW TO BE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION AND IT IS THOUGHT AND WE DON'T KNOW FORSURE BUT IS THOUGHT THAT SOME OF THAT DEPRESSION WAS PROBABLY TRIGGERED BY AN OVER INDULGENCE IN VIDIO GAMES AND OTHER HIGHLY DOPEMAN URGIC ACTIVITIES TO THE POINT WHERE THOSE ACTIVITIES EF VENTUALLY WERE COUNTERED BY THE PAIN BALANCE THAT DOCTOR ANALEMPKI DESCRIBED AND HE NOW HAS TO DO THOSE ACTIVITIES REPEATEDLY AND FOR MANY MANY HOURS EACH DAY JUST TO FEEL O KAY NOT EVEN TO DERIVE PLEASURE FROM THEM AND WORSE MANY OTHER ACTIVITIES PRACTICALLY ALL T OTHER ACTIVITIES HAVE LOST THEIR ZEST THEY'VE LOST THEIR EXCITEMENT AND THEIR AND HIS SENSE OF PLEASURE FOR THEM AND SO THEREIS ARE REALLY A ACTIVE CAMPAIGN NOW TO RESET THAT SYSTEM SO NUMBER ONE DON'T OVERWHELM YOUR PLEASURE CENTERS EITHER THROUGH ACTIVITIES OR COMPOUNDS I SEEM COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT YOUR SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR ANTEDONIA AND DEPRESSION IF YOU DO THAT SNOT JUST ABOUT ADDICTION THAT TO BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT SETTING YOURSELF FOR ANADONIA AND DEPRESSION HOW OFTEN CAN YOU ENGAGE IN THESE ACTIVITIES WELL THAT N A DIFFER FROM PERSON A PERSON EVERYONE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY MIND YOUR EXTREME HIGES AND YOUR EXTREME LOWS AND BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THOSE WILL PROBABLY HAVE A DOCTOR LEMKION AGAIN AN A FUTURE TIME TO TRY AND GET SOME MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT THAT BUT IF YOU DO FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO RESET THAT SYSTEM IT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE A THIRDY DAY COMPLETE DETOLKS FROM WHATEVER ACTIVITY YOUR SUBSTANCE THAT IS AND IDEALLY IT DOESN'T CONTINUE AFTER THAT THIRTY DAYS SPECIALLY IN A CONDITIONS OF DRUGS OF ABUSE SECOND OF ALL TALKED ABY THE NOR UP AND EFFERENT SYSTEM AND HOW THE NORPAND EFFERENT SYSTEM IS REALLY DEFICIENT IN MANY A FORMS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION AND IN DEPRESSION THERE IS NOW MORE DELIBERATE PURSUIT OF NOR UP AND EFFERENT INDUCING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE HEALTHY THAT AREN'T A A DRENALIN SEEKING PURSAY THINGS LIKE COLD SHOWERS THINGS LIKE PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF BREATHING THAT ENGAGE AND AND TEND TO MAKE US MORE ALERT THINGS LIKE EXERCISE THAT WILL INCREASE AUR LEVELS OF NORGRENALIN I BE REMISS IF I SAID THAT THESE ACTIVITIES COULD COMPLETELY ELIMINATE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTEMS AN PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE AND AGAIN I ONE OF CKNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY THE WILLINGNESS OR A THE CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES BUT THINGS LIKE COLD SHOWERS DELIBERATE COL CHOWERS THINGS LIKE REGULAR EXERCISE THEY AREN'T JUST FEEL GOOD ACTIVITIES THEY ACTUALLY ENGAGE THE NORUP AN EFFERNT SYSTEM AND AND KEEP THAT SYSTEM TUNED UP AND ALLOW US TO INCREASE OUR NORUP AN EFFERN LEVELS AT WILL ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEIR MOOD ENHANCING EFFECTS ARE REAL EFFACTS THAT AT THE LEVEL OF NOR CHEMISTRY THEN WE TALKED ABOUT EPIES THESE ESSENTIAL FACT EASIDS ANS CLEAR THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE AM GETTING ABOVE A THOUSAND MELEGRAMS AND PROBLEVIN CLOSER TO TWO THOUSAND MILIGRAMS PERDAY OF E PES CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR MOOD ESPRECIARLY IN ATTEMPTS TO TREAT OR OFFSET MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER ARE THEIR SIDE EFFECTS WELL YOU NEED TO EXPLORE THOSE FOR YOURSELF AND WITH YOUR DOCTOR EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT HELTH BACKGROUND AH YOU KNOW FOR THE MARGINS OF SAFETY FOR MOST PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY BE QUITE OM QUITE LARGE BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE ON THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE SO DEFILY DEFLING CHECK WITH YOUR PHYSICION WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT EXERCISE AND HOW E P  AND EXERCISE ON A REGULAR BASIS CAN OFFSET THESE INFLAMMATORY PATHWAYS I WANT A MENTION SOMETHING I MENTION ON A PREVIOUS PODCAST BUT IN TERMS OF KEEPING THE INFLAMMITOME ALL THESE MOLECULES THAT CREATIN FLAMMATION AND THEN THE INFLAMMATION CAN LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF SARATONAN THROUGH THE PATHWAYS WE DESCRIBED IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT'S ALSO VERY VERY USEFUL TO IN JEST TWO TO FOUR SERVINGS OF FORMENTED FOODS ON A DAILY BASIS ARE NEAR DAILY BASIS THESE ARE DATED THAT WERE PUBLISHED BY THE SONANBURG LABIT STAMFORD RECENTLY IN THE JOURNAL SELL SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THAT INGESTION OF THESE FORMENTED FOODS REALLY KEEPS THE GOT MYCROBIOM TUNED UP SO TO SPEAK WELL IN ORDER TO OFFSET THESE INFLAMMATORY SIDAKINDS KEEPING INFLAMMATION AT BAG IT JUST TURNS OUT TO BE A REALLY GOOD THING IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR MOOD IN A GOOD PLACE SO E P EXERCISE FOR MENTED FOODS CREATINE AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF OF RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION OR OFFSETTING OR KEEPING US AWAY FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION OR RELAPSE INTO DEPRESSION AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS AN THE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE BEING USED MAINLY IN THE COURSE OF STUDIES AND OF SYCHIATRY AND DEPRESSION THINGS LIKE CADAMINE PIECY PIE SILICIBEN AND RELATED COMPOUNDS AND THEN LASTLY WE TALKED ABOUT QUITOSIS WHICH MAY NOT BE RIGHT FOR EVERYBODY BUT MIGHT BE RIGHT FOR CERTAIN ON INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE WHO ARE GRAPPLING WITH THIS IF YOUR LEARNING FROM THIS PODCAST AND HOPEFULLY ENJOYING IT AND APPLYING SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE

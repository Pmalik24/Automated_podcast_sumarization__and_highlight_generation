WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LATPONCENCE CU SCIENCE SCIENCE SPACE TO  FORLIFE I MANDERHUBERMAN AND A A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY GUESS TODAY IS DOCTOR MICHAEL ISENBERG DOCTOR MICHAEL EISENBERG IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR SPECUALIZING IN EUROLOGY AND AN EXPERT IN MALE SEXUAL FUNCTION AND FERTILITY HE IS BOTH A CLINITION WHO SEES PATIENTS AS WELL AS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST HAVING PUBLISHED OVER THREE HUNDRED PURE REVIEWED ARTICLES ON MALE SEXUAL FUNCTION EUROLOGY AND FERTILITY AND HE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE WORLD'S FOREMOST EXPERTS IN MALE SEXUAL HEALTH TO DAY WE DISCUSS A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS IMPORTANT TO ALL MEN INCLUDING E RECTILE DISFUNCTION AND FUNCTION WE ALSO DISCUSS PROSTATE HEALTH AND URINARY HEALTH WE DISCUSS FERTILITY AND SPERM COUNT WE DISCUSS EVEN TOPICS SEEMINGLY ESOTERIC SUCH AS WHY PENILE LENGTHS ARE ACTUALLY INCREASING OVER TIME WHILE SPERM COUNT SEEM TO BE DECREASING TODAY YOU'LL ALSO LEARN SOME VERY INTERESTING SURPRISES SUCH IS THE FACT THAT A VERY VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF RECTILE DISFUNCTION ACTUALLY STEMS FROM HORMONE DISFUNCTION RATHER THE VAST MAJORITY OF RECTILE DIS FUNCTION STEMS FROM ISSUES THAT ARE EITHER VASCULAR THAT IS RELATED TO BLOODFLOW OR NURL AND TO DAY YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT A LARGE VARIETY OF TREATMENTS FOR ERECTILE DIS FUNCTION DOCTOR EISENBURG ALSO DISPELS A LOT OF COMMON MYTHS THAT YOU HEAR OUT THERE BOTH ON THE INTERNET AND IN POPULAR CULTURE THAT RELATE TO MALE SEXUAL HEALTH AND FUNCTION BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MALE SEXUAL HEALTH IS HOW IT RELATES TO OTHER ASPECTS OF HEALTH AND HOW TO THINK ABOUT TREATING MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING ALL ASPECTS OF MALE SEXUAL HEALTH FERTILITY AND FUNCTION BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUME OUR INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOL OLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THO THANK THE SPONSERS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ROCA ROCA MAKES EYE GLASSES AND SUNGLASSES THAT ARE OF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED BY TWO ALL AMERICAN SWIMMERS FROM STAMFORD AND EVERYTHING ABOUT ROCA EYEGLASSES AND SUNGLASSES WERE DESIGNED WITH PERFORMANCE IN MIND I'VE SPENT A LIFETIME WORKING ON THE BIOLOGY OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOUR RIGIAL SYSTEM HAS TO CONTEND WITH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE CLEARLY ROCA UNDERSTANDS THIS AND I'S DESIGN EYE GLASSES BOTH FOR SPORT ND FOR WEARING IN CASUAL SETTINGS OR TO WORK OR TO DINNER THAT ALWAYS ALLOW YOU TO SEE WITH CRYSTAL CLARITY THEIR EYEGLASSES ARE EXTREMELY LIGHT WAIGT END THEY WON'T SLIP OFF YOUR FACE EVEN IF YOU GET SWEATY I WEAR ROCA SUNGLASSES WHEN I'M DRIVING INTO DIRECT SUNLIGHT OR WHEN IT'S PARTICULARLY BRIGHT DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ROCA EYEGLASSES OR SUNGLASSES GO TO ROCA THAT'S R O K A DOK CALM AND ENTER THE CODE HUBERMEN TO SAVE TWENTY PER CENT OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER AGAIN THAT'S ROCA R O K A DOT CALM AND ENTER THE CODE HUBERMAN AT CHECKOUT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY I'VE SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP REALLY IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IS CORRECT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL IN STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN PROGRAM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IN THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF YOUR NIGHT IN HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES LIKE TRACKING THE AMOUNT OF RAPID E MOVENT AND SLOW WAVE SLEEP THAT YOU GET THINGS ARE ESSENTIAL TO REALLY DILING IN THE PERFECT NIGHT SLEEP FOR YOU I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON AN EGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR WELL OVER TWO YEARS NOW AND IT HAS GREATLY IMPROVED MY SLEEP BY FALL ASLEEP FAR MORE QUICKLY I WAKE UP FAR LESS OFTEN IN THE IDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND I WAKE UP FEELING FAR MORE REFRESHED THAN I EVER DID PRIORTY USING AN EIGHTESLEEP MATTRESS COVER IF YOU LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO SAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POT THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP KERNLLY SHIPS TO THE U ESSAY CANADA UK SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE U AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR MICHAEL ISENBURG DOCTOR ISENBURG WELCOME THINK YOU COULD BE HER HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR AT TO TALKING TO YOU FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE THESE DAYS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE DIMINISHING QUALITY OF SPERM WHICH IN SOME WAY SEEMS TO BE TACKED TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT DIMINISHING QUALITY OF ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE INTELLIGENCE YOU KNOW HAT THERE'S A LOT WOVEN INTO THIS STATEMENT THAT SPERM QUALITY IS DECLINING AND SOME OF IT I THINK PEOPLE ASSUME IS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES SOME OF IT ITHINK PEOPLE ASSUME IT ARE RELATED TO CHANGERS IN BEHAVIORS SO MAY BE LESS EXERCISE LESS SUNLIGHT WHO KNOWS HOFLY YOU'LL TELL US WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON BUT THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS IS SPERM QUALITY ACTUALLY DECLINING AND REGARDLESS WHAT IS SPERM QUALITY YE GREAT QUESTION SO I THINK IT'S VERY CONTROVERSIAL I THINK IS YOUR QUESTION ALLUDES TO SO I THINK WE WILL START BY JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT SPERM QUALITY IS AND WHIDESENPORM SO FOR REPRODUCTION AS YOU'VE COVERED ON THE PODCASTLEFOR MAN MAKE SEAMEN AND THAT HAS SPERMAN IT AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING CLENICALLY ABOUT A SEAMEN ANALYSIS THERE'S A FEW THINGS WE LOOK AT WE LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF EJACULATE SEAMEN THAT COMES OUT WE LOOK IT THE SPERM HOW MANY THERE ARE WE LOOK AT THEIR MOTILITY OR MOVEMENT WE LOOK AT THEIR MORE FILES OR SHAPE THERE'S SOME MORE ADVANCE TESTING THAT'S DONE IN RARE CASES LOOKING AT FRAGMENTATION OF THE INAY FOR EXAMPLE OR SOME NEW R TESTLOOKING IN HEPIGENETIC PROFILES OF SPERM BUT ESSENTIALLY THESE ARE ALL MARKERS OR FERTILITY SO FERTILITY IN ITSELF AS A TEAM SPORT RIGHT SO IT'S HARD TO IU MIT LABEL A MAN IS FERTILE ARE NOT FERTILE WITHOUT KNOWING ABOUT HAS PARTNER A BUT NEVERTHELESS BASED ON DIFFERENT THESE DIFFERENT PRIAMETERS WE TRY AND QUANTIFY HOW LIKELY MAN IS TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A PREGNANCY SO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION EVERY DECADE OR SO LOOKSOVER THE EXISTING LITERATURE AND DEFINES THESE DIFFERENT CUT POINTS OF WHAT'S NORMAL OR WHAT SUB FERTILE AFOR THOSE LEVELS SO THAT SORT OF THE BACKDROP OF WHAT SEAMEN IS AND HOW YOU KNOW THESE THESE TESTS ARE DONE OR YOU NOW WHAT THESE TESTS REPRESENT NOW THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY HAVE DECLINED OVER TIME EM HAS BEEN YOU KNOW QUESTION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THERE IS A LANDMARK PAPER IN THE EARLY NINETIES Y CARLSON IN A GROUP AND DENMARK THAT SHOWED THIS TEMPORAL DECLINE YOU OVERTHELAST FIFTY YEARS FROM THAT TINE POINT AND SO WHAT THE INVESTIGATORS HA DONE AS LOOKED OVER THE LITERATURE FOR STUDIES THAT REPORTED SEAMEN QUALITY AROUND THE WORLD AND NOTED THAT YOU KNOW THE QUALITY IN THE EARLIEST STUDIES LIK CAN COUNT OF THE MID A TWENTIETH CENTURY WOR HERE AND THAT OVER TIME THEY HAD SORT OF DECLINE THE MORE RECENT STUDIES E NOW OF THAT STUDY WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL THERE WAS QUESTIONS ABOUT WAITING FROM DIFFERENT STUDIES PUTTING BECAUSE THERE YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF EARLY STUDIES SO PUTTING A LOT MORE IMPORTANCE ON THOSE RATHER THAN SOME OF THE LATER ONES  AND SO SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN MANY OTHER STUDIES THAT HAVE THAT HAVE COME OUT AN TIME AND EVEN TODAY IT REMAINS VERY CONTROVERSIAL I THINK YOU KNOW I WERE TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THERE'S A DECLINE SOME OF MY COLLEGUES AND FRIENDS WOULD BE VERY UPSET WITH ME I SAY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ALL MY COLLEAUES AND FRIENDS WOUD BE VERY UPSUT WITH ME SO I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW MY OPINION REALLY VARIES BASED ON WHOSE PAPER I'VE READ AND I'VE THERE'S SOME VERY CONVINCING YOU KNOW STUDIES ON EACH SIDE OF IT YOU KNOW THER MOST RECENTLY JUST IN THE LAST YEAR SO THERE WAS A MEDANALYSIS OF  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN WHERE THEY LOOKED O AGAIN A HOST OF THESE STUDIES OVER THE LAST ANUMBER OF DECADES ALL AROUND THE GLOBE SO PRIOR STUDIES YOU REALLY JO SPOKE A STO OM THE WESTERN HEMISTER WESTERN COUNTRIES CAUSE THERE WAS MORE DATA FROM THAT BUT MORE RECENTLY HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF DATA FROM AFRICA FROM ASIAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AND THOSE ALSO SUPPORT THIS DECLIME EM SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE COUNTER ARGUMENTS TO WHY WERE SEEING THAT IS JUST SORT OF AN EVOLUTION OF TECHNIQUES OVER TIME EM SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THE SORT OF THE POPULAR EM QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S REALLY A TRUE TO CLIME EM YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S YOUR ALLUDING TO WHY THERE WOULD BE A CLINED AS ALSO YOU KNOW UNKNOWN AND BUT YOU SORT OF LABELL YOU KOW PERFECTLY THAT CONOMOST COMMON HYPOTHESY SO WETHERS ON ENVIREMENTAL EXPOSURES RIGHTE A LOT OF THINGS OF CHANGED OVERLAST FIFTY YEARS AND I THINK YOU KNOW CHEMICAL EXPOSURE CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FAIRLY CONBEEN SEEING YOU KNOW PRECLINICAL STUDIES SO YOU KNOW MOSTLY DONE IN ANIMALS A THAT SHOW THAT LIKE EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT CHEMICALS DALLIDS EM A B PIE OTHER THINGS MAY ACTUALLY HARM YOU KNOW REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION FOR MEN AND FOR WOMEN AS WELL AND SO IT MAY BE THAT YOU KNOW THESE CHEMICALS YE THAT ARE THAT WERE BEING EXPOSED TO AS KIDS AND ADULTS OR EVEN PROBLY EM MORE SINISTERLY WHEN WERE EM YOU KNOW CONT OF DEVELOPING IN UTERO THAT MAY BE COUNT OF THE MOST HARMFUL EXPOSURE EM BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN OU KNOWN OBICITY EPIDEMIC AS WELL AND THERE'S A STRONG LINKTH BETWEEN AMEN MAN'S REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION EM AND BODYWEIGHT AND SO THAT'S ALSO E THOUGHT TO PLAY A ROLE IN SOME OF THIS TOO EM SO I THINK THERE ARE IN CONVINCING STUDIES BUT THE OTHER I GUESS ASPECT O THIS AS THAT THERE'S VARIATIONS AND SEAMEN QUALITY AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD THERE'S GEOGRAPHIC BARIATION AND SO THAT'S ALSO A SORT OF A UNKNOWN EM A EXPLANATION EYOU KNW THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT FORT A GENETIC YOU KNOW COMPOSITIONS OF MEN AND SO THERS DIFFENT REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL IN THAT SOURCE THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT IN BIREMENTAL EXPOSURES DIET EXERCISED LIFE STYLE AN THERE'S A FAMOUS STUDY EM DONE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHERE THEY LOOKED AT SEAMEN QUALITY AMONG FATHERS SO THESE ARE MEN THAT IT ACHIEVED A PREGNANCY AND AT THE FIRST YOU KNO PRENATAL VISIT THEY HAD AM THE FATHERS GIVE A SEAMEN SAMPLE AND SO THIS WAS DONE FOUR CENTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY I THINK IT ONEY CALIFORNIA THERE WAS AM ONE IN THE MIDWEST A THERE IS ONE IN NEW YORK SO THEY BASICALLY FOUND THAT  SEAMAN QUALLID IT WAS O HIGHEST IN THE URBAN CENTERS IN NEW YORK TENDED TO BE THE HIGHEST NUMBERS WHERE IT WAS YOU KNOW LOWER IN THE MIDWEST AND SO THE HYPOTHESIS WAS POTENTIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS A MORE RURAL SETTING MAYBE THERE WAS PASISIDE EXPOSURE THAT HAD LED TO THESE LOWER NUMBERS BUT OU KNOW ANOTHER EQUALLY PLOUSIBLE EXPLANATION MAY BE THAT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SORT OF A DIFFERENT POPULATION AND MAY BE BE NO THAT THAT COULD EXPLAIN THESE DIFFERENCIS SO I THINK IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT AM AND I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SORT OF LACKING THINGS AND THIS AS THERE'S NOT REALLY LOGITUNAL DATA ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS WOULD BE IF WE JUST STARTAD TRACKING AM SEAMAN QUALITY ARE ON THE COUNTRY JUST LIKE WE DO A BECITY LIKE YOU KNOW ANHANES A SD SEES A SURVEY OF HEALTH IN IN US IF WE HAD A SEAMAN QUALITY ON TO THAT THAT WAY YOU COULD REALLY SEE YOU KNOW HOW IT VERIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND YOU KNOW SORT OF COMPARE LIKE TO LIKE TO SEE OVER TIME IF THERE'S REALITOUS PROGRESSION WOU NW ANT OF THE ONLY STUDIES TO DO THAT IN DENMARK E THEYAVE STARTED AROUND YOU W ROUND TWO THOUSAND AND TRACT SEAMEN QUALITY AMONG THEM YOU KNOW VOLUNTEERS IT CAME IN WHEN THEY WERE CONSCRIPTED FOR MILITARY SERVICE IN DENMARK THEY WERE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE THE STUDY EM AND SO SOME MEN DID AND WHAT THEY FOUND AS ACTUALLY THAT SEAMAN CUALLIT IT WAS FAIRLY UNIFORM OVER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS WHER THEY HAD DATA BUT SORT OF ANOTHER VERY INTERESTING PART OF THAT STUDY IS THAT ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THOSE MEN HAD NORMAL SEAMEN QUALITY AM SO SORT OF VERY CONCERNING YOU KNOWS I GUESS REASSURING THAT IT WASN'T FURTHER DECLINING BUT VERY CONCERNING AND ONLY A QUARTER OF DANISH MEN HAD BEEN A NORMAL SEAMEN QUALITY AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE I THINK THOUGHT LEADERS IN THIS FIELD IM JUST BECAUSE OF A REPRODUCTIVE CRISIS THERE YOU MENTION THAT SOME OF THIS APPARENT DECLINE IN SEEMING QUALITY MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE TOOLS TO MEASURE SEEMING QUALITY ARE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AND THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF FOR INSTANCE ONE IS JUST LOOKING AT TOTAL VOLUME MORE FOLIGY THE WHICH OEN SHAPE I SHOULD HAVE CLARIFY THAT A HOW MANY FORWARDLY MOTILE SPERM THERE ARE AND THEN ALSO ADDING IN YOU KNOW A VERY SENSITIVE MEASURE SUCH AS A DANA FRAGMENTATION YOU ISSENTIALLY AS THE INSTRUMENTS GET FINER AND FINER YOU DISCOVER MORE AND MORE DETAILS AND IF YOU ARE A RADING QUALITY ALONG A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS THAN IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THOSE WHOUD TEER OUT INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS SO IF ONE WERE TO SIMPLY ASK FOUR COUPLES WHO WANT TO GET PREGNENT AND ASSUMING THAT EGG QUALITY IS NOT THE ISSUE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FAILURES TO ACHIEVE SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF DEFICIENT SPUR DEFICIENT IN ANY WAY AND IS THAT NUMBER INCREASING OVERTIME YE SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY HEY I THINK WHEN COUPLES THINK ABOUT FERTILITY USUALLY AS THOUGHT OF AS A FEMALE PROBLEM AND I THINK THERE'S A HISTORIC REASONS FOR THAT YOU KNW IF YOU LOOK IT DAT IN U S WHEN COUPLES DU SEET CARE FOR FERTILITY THE MAN IS BY PASS PROBABLY A THIRD OF THE TIME EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REASONS FOR FERTILITY MAN CONTRIBUTES PROBEHALF OF THE TIME TO INFERTILITY SO I THINK THERE'S A HALF HALF  SO I THINK THERE'S A HUGE NEED JUST TO UNDERSTAND AND IVALUATE THE MAN AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS I THINK IS THAT A YOU KOW ONE OF THE MAIN TREATMENTS FOR INFERTILITY IN THE U S IS I B  WHICH IS VERY POWERFUL I THINK ONE OF THE YOU KNOW GREATEST MARVELS OF MEDICINE IN PROBABLY THE LAST YOU KNOW QUARTER CENTURY IS AREABILITY TO MAXES A SPERMANGG IN THIS IN CREATE A LIFE IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE BUT BECAUSE NOW TAKES JUST THE SINGLE SPERM YOU KNOW THROUGH SOMETHING CALLED INTERCIDE O POSING SPIRMINJECTIONARRY CONJECT ONE EGG OR ONE'S BURN INTO AN EGG YOU KNOW THE BAR HAS GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY YOU KNOW FOR COUPLES JUST TRYING WITHOUT YOU KOW ANY ASSISTANCE PROBABLYNED TWENTY TO FORTY MILLION MOVING SPIRM BUT NOW WITH YOU KNOW THESE REMARKABLE TECNISU TUST NEED ONE SPIRM U AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF OUR ENOVATION AND RESEARCH ON MAL FERTILITY IS PROBABY GONE TO THE WAYSIDE TO SPEAK AS CLINICALLY YOU KNOW WE JUST NEED YOU KNOW A FEW DOZEN SPIRM FOR MOST COUPLES WHAT ABOUT TESTOSTROA LEVELS ARE THOSE ALSO DECLINING WE HEAR THIS U AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE LITERATURE I CON FINED EVIDENCE FOR THAT BUT THE QUESTION IS ALSO WHETHER NOT THE AMOUNT OF DECLININTESTOSTRO LEVELS AS SIGNIFICANT IN A WAY THAT IMPACTS WHAT SAY FERTILITY BUT ALSO U VITALITY IN OTHER WAYS ENERGY MOOD U SEXUAL HEALTH ET CETERA A WHAT'S THE TORY WITH TESTOTRON LEVELS ARE THEY INDEED DECLINING ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE MAIL POPULATION IN THE YOU ASSEN ELSEWHERE I THINK THERE IS PRETTY CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS HAPPENING AND I THINK THE REASON FOR THAT AGAIN IS PROBABLY NOT CERTAIN BUT YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW SOME PRETTY NICELY DO IN COHORT STUDIES WHERE THEY VE RECRUITED YOU KNOW MEN AND THAT THE TWO THOUSANDS THE NINETIES THE EIGHTIES AND YOU CAN SEE THAT DEPENDING ON WHEN THESE MEN ARE RECRUITED JUST YOU KNOW MATCHING AGE FOR AGE THESE TESTCHAN LEVELS TEND TO BE LOWER  AND THEN EN HANES WHICH IS GAIN THIS SORT OF LOGIGENAL STUDY RUN BY THE SEDY SEA E THAT IS ALSO SHOWN ANDLOOKING AT TESTOSTRAN LEVELS OVER REU NO DECADES THE TESTOCHAN LEVELS HAVE TECLINED OVER TIME UM SO THERE YOU KNOW CHEMICAL EXPOSURES ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION AGAIN EITHER IN A DULL TR ADOLESCENT LIFE OR A UNERO  BUT OBISEI I THINK AS ALSO PORT OF A CONVINCING EXPLANATION IS WERE MORE SEDENTARY  YOU KNOW WE GET BIGGER THAT'S ONE OF THE PLACES THAT TESTASTRAN CAN DECLINE I THINK THERE'S DIFFERENT FRT OF EXPLANATIONS FOR THAT U YOU KNOWS TESTOSTRANS PRODUCED IT'S A ROMATIZED AN A PERFERAL TISSUE YOU KOW VATIC TISSUE FAT HAS LOT OF THIS ROMANTASTES OF THAT CONVERSE TESTOSTRON TO ESTROGEN SO IT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW LOWERS THE TESTOSTRON LEVEL THAT CIRCULATING IN OUR BODY I'M ALSO DISINSULATING THAT THE TESTACLS OR THIGHS GET VIGOR INSLATING THE TESTES CAN ALSO SOMETIMES LOWER THE EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION A LITTLE BECAUSE OF HEAT EFFECTS FOR THE HAT EFFECTS I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT THIS LATOR BUT I'LL ASK ABOUT NOW SINCE WE'RE TUNGING MY HEAT EFFECTS AND IM SPERMAN TESTOSTRON AM THE HEAT OF COURSE BEING A NOT GOOD FOR AM SPERM HEALTH AND TESTOSTRON WHICH IS I'VE READ A MATAANALYSIS I DON'T KNOW AM HOW HIGH QUALITY IT IS BUT AM THAT EXPLAINED THAT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE FOR IM EITHER HEAT OFFECTS OR POSSIBLY NON HEAT RELATED AFFACTS OF SELPHONE YOUN SMART PHONE IN THE POCKET IN PARRING SPERM HEALTH MAY BE VEN TESTOSTRON LEVELS NOW YOU HEAR THIS MORE OFTEN AND KIND OF BIOHACKE AUM I DON'T KNO A CIRCLES AM WHICH YOU KNOW I'M NOT A FAN OFTHE WORD BIOHACKIN AM IT DOES IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT IT MEANS BUT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT MEANS SOMETHING ABOUT TAKING A SHORT CUT USING ONE THING FOR A PURPOSE IT WASN'T INTENDED BUT YOU KNOW IT ALSO MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT A SMART PHONE COULD GENERATE SOME HEAT IM SOME RADIATION THAT MIGHT IMPIR AM TESTICULAR FUNCTION AND THEREFOR IMPAR SPERM QUALITY AND OR TESTOSTRON LEVELS BUT IS THERE ANY REAL SOLID DATA THAT CARRING YOUR SELPHONE IN YOUR POCKET LET'S US WHOM ON THAT THE SULPHONE IS ON IS BAD FOR SPERM HEALTH OR TESTOSTRON LEVELS YES O IM I THINK THERE'S NOT CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT ITS GIN HELPS IM TESTOSTRO LEVELS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I GN A HURT TESTOSTRO IT'S NOT GET TO HURT YE SO I SHOULDN'T IU TO MAKE CLEAR THAT I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION AND HEAT EFFECTS OU NA SPERM PRODUCTION IS MUCH MORE SENSITIVE THAN TESTOSTRON PRODUCTION BUT THERE HAVE BEE E SOME STUDIES LOOKING IT SELPHONE EXPOSURE BECAUSE AGAIN YR'REGETTING THI WHETHER IT'S HEAPED WHETHER IT' SORT OF THE YOU KNOW RADIA FREQUENCY YOU KNOW WAVES COMING IN I THINK YOU CAND DEPOSIT SORT OF DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS OF WHY THAT MAY BE HARMFUL SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES THAT YOU KNOW LOOKED EARLY ON YOU KNOW MEN THAT USE SELPHONES MORE OR LESS THEY HAD LOWER SEAMAN QUALITY IF THEY USED IT MORE BUT YOU CAN ALSO IMAGINEERS HUGE DIFFERENCES IN MEN THAT DO AND DO NOT USE SELPHONE SO YOU KNOTS IT'S IT'S A HARD EXPERIMENTS O DESIGN BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES A DOING THIS IN VITROSO IN THE LABORATORIES OF TAKING YOU KNOW SFIRM IN A CUP BASICALLY AND PUTTING A SELPHONE NEXT TO IT OR NOT NEXT TO IT TO TRYAND SEE IF THAT PLAYED A ROL THERE'VE BEEN STUDIES DONE WHERE THEY AM SORT OF NORMALIZED THE THE HEAT YOU KNOW THEY CANTO PUT ON AM A SORT OF A SPECIAL STAGE SO THAT IT'S NOT HEAT NECESSARILY MAYBE ITS AREIF EXPOSURE SO THOSE STUDIES I THINK DON'T SHOW SORT OF MEE ECLINICALLY MEANINGFUL CHANGE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES TO SAY THAT MAYBE DANA FRAGMENTATION OF SFIRM CAN GO UP A LITTLE BIT IF THERE'S CLOSE PROXIMITY A TO A SELPHONE A SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN PATIENTE ASKD ME TAT WHICH THE COMMON QUESTION I GET ITN CLINICOVIOUSLY PATIENTS ARE COMING AND THEY WANT TO DO WEU KNOW WHATEVER THEY CAN AM TO TRY AND IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES A SO I THINK GENERALLY THINK THAT DATE OS NOT CONVINCING AM BUT YU KNOW IT'S EASY ENOUGH CERTAINLY TO BE AWARE OF IT YOU KNO I THINK PUTTING A LAPTOP ON A DESCRIBE THAN IN YOUR LAP I THINK FOR HEAT EXPOSURE IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING TO WE WANT MINIMISE ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I DID AN EPISODE ABOUT TESTASTRO AN ESTROGIN WHERE IT'S MANUFACTURED IN THE MALN FEMAL BODY ET CETERA AND FOUND A VERY INTERESTING GRAFF IN A A TEXT BOOK ON A BEHAVIOURL ANDER CHRONOLOGY I GOT NAME RANDY NELSON WHO I HAPPEN TO KNOW THROUGH THE FIELD OF BEHAVIOUR  IN THE CHRONOLOGY AS IT'S TYPICALLY STUDIED IN ANIMALS SO MOST OF THAT BOOK CENTERS ON ANIMAL STUDIES BUT THERE'S A FRACTION OF THE STUDIES THAT CENTERE ON HUMAN A DATA AND THERE WAS A VERY INTERESTING GRAFF THAT SHOWED TESTOSTRAL LEVELS AS A FUNCTION OF AGE IN MALES A AND AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT TESTOSTROE LEVELS WERE ON AVERAGE MUCH HIGHER IN LEIGHTEENS EARLY TWENTIES THIRTIES AND THERE WAS A PROGRESSIVE DECLINE BUT WHAT WAS REMARKABLE TO ME ABOUT THAT GRAPH IS THAT EVEN WHEN EXPLORING THE A ESCATTER PLOTSCASI THEY SHOWED INDIVIDUAL POINTS THEY DIDN'T JUST SHOW THE AVERAGES OF TESTOSTRNE LEVELS IN MEN IN THEIR FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTIES EIGHTIS EVEN NINETIES THERE WERE THESE OUTLIERS THESE GUYES WHO HAD TESTOSTRONE LEVELS THAT WERE ON PAR WITH A TESTOCTRONE LEVELS OF MEN IN THEIR THIRTIES BUT THESE GAS WERE IN THEIR FIFT SIXTY SEVENTIES EIGHTIES EVEN NINETIES SO DO YOU OBSERVE THIS CLINICALLY DO YOU OBSERVE THAT A MEN ARE COMING IN YOU NOW AFT WHO ARE OLDER THAN FORTY AND HAVE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS AND PRESUMABLY FREE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS AS WELL A THAT ARE STILL VERY HIGH YOU KNOW I  THE REASON I ASKE US THAT I THINK WEVE ALVE BEEN TOLD AND WE PRESUME THAT TESTOSTRONE LEVELS DECLINE WITH AGE AND ONE WOULD EXPECT SOME OUT LIERS AND OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER NOT THOSE GUIES IN THEIR NINETIES WHO HAVE THE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS OF THAT MATCH THE AVERAGES OF MEN IN THEIR THIRTES DIDN'T HAVE EVEN GREATER TESTOSTRONE LEVELS IN THEIR THIRTIES BUT GIVEN THAT THEY WERE SEALING DOUT AROUND NINE HUNDRED ANIGRAMS PRODESILYER YOU HAD TOWARD THE HIGH AND NORMAL DEPENDING ON THE SCALE A IN ALREADY AT AGE NINETY'GON'T HARD TO IMAGINE THAT EARLIERE THEIR WALKING AROUND WITH O TWO THOUSAND ANIGRAM PRODESTOLIER TESTOSTRONE SO DO YOU SEE THIS ARE THERE SOME IS THERE JUST A LOT OF NATURAL VARIATION IND TESTOSTRON LEVELS OF MEN WHO WALK INTO THE CLINIC AT ANY AGE AND OF COURSE WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IU O MAINTAINING HIGH NORMAL TESTOSTRONE LEVELS INTO THEIR LATER YEARS YETS THE GREAT QUESTION I THINK THIS IS SUCH A COMMON QUESTION ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT TESTOSTRONE I THINK AN SIERE TACK ABOUT MOST SORT OF A CLINICAL TESTS THAT WE DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS AVERAGE WHAT IS NORMAL SO WE DO SEE GREAT VARIATION I MEAN I THINK JUST LIKE YOUR SAYING I USUALLY LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT YOU NOW USUALLY TESTOSTRONE PEAKS IN A KIND OF EARLY TWENTIES AND ANTENDS TO GO DOWN PROBABLY ONE PERCENT A YEAR FOR EVER BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE VURIN YOU KNOW VERY VERY HIGH LEVELS YOU KNOW JUST MEARING YOU KOW THAT GRAP THAT YOU DESCRIBE I CERTAINLY HAVE PATIENTS YOU KOW WE SCREEN FOR TESTOSTRN LEVELS YOU KNOW INPATIENTE COME IN WITH COMPLAINTS OR WERE WORRIED ABOUT THAT LOW ENERGY LEVEL YOU KNOW LO LOBIDO SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF LOTESTOSTRON SEXUAL DISFUNCTION AND YOU KNOW TO MYSE SURPRISE SOME TIMES THESE MEN YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN EIGHT YEAR OLDS THAT CERTAINLY HAVE THE HIGHEST TESTOSTRON LEVEL ALL SEE OVER SIX MONTHS YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS I THINK IT'S NOT CERTAIN MAY BE ASKED TO DO IF YOU KNOW ID THINK WITH EVERYTHIN THAE'S PROBABY SORT OF A BELLSHAPE CURVE AND EVERYBODY'S LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT ANDERS AN SENSITIVITY O SENSITIVITY THE RECEPTOR YOU KNOW THEY MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENTLY BUT I HAVE NOT REALLY NOTICED GENTAS AT LEAST IN CLINICAL PRACTICE YOU KNOW INPATIENCE COME IN THEY COME IN WITH THE COMPLAINT AND SO EVEN MEN YOU KNW IT VERY HIGH LEVELS THEY MAY HAVE SOME OF THE SAME DISFUNCTION MEN WITH LOW LEVELS SO I THINK WITH LOW LEVELS YOU CAN TRY AND TREAT THAT AND THAT MAY BE THE SOLUTION BUT FOR MEN WITH YOU KNOW THESE WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER HIGH LEVELS YOU KOW THERE MAY BE OTHER ISSUES GOING ON ME FRAME THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK A LITLE BUT DIFFERENTLY WHEN SOME ONE COMES IN TO YOUR CLINEC AND YOU MEASURE THEIR TESTOSTRO LEVELS AS YOU MENTION THEIR LIKELY COMING IN BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME ISSUE PROSTATE ISSUE SECTUAL FUNCTION ISSUE ET CETERA BUT YOU DO GET A READ ON THERE YOU KNOW T'SA CRUDE MORPHOLOGY OF THEIR BODY WRIGHT SO YOU COULD VISIBLY DETERMINE WHETHER NOT THER LIKELY TO BE OBEAST OR NOT UNREGARDLESS OF AGE SO EARLIER YOU MENTIONED OBSITY AS A RISK FACTOR FOR LOWERING TESTOSTRON AND SPERM QUALITY YOU MENTION THAT FAT A ROMATIZES TESTOSTRON INTESTROGEN SO THAT'S AT LEAST ONE MECHANISM BY WHICH THAT COULD HAPPEN BUT IF YOU WERE TO JUST STEP BACK AND SAY OKE IF SOMEBODY WHO WALKS INTO MY CLINEC TENDS TO BE UNLESS THEY HEALTHIER LOOKING YO KNOW NOT O BES MUST JUST PUT THE CUT OFF AT WHAT YOU WOULD PRESUME IS OBEST U IS THERE A HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT THEIR TESTOSTRO LEVELS ARE GOING TO BE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE CONVERSELY WHEN SOMEBODY WALKS IN IN THEIR OBIST IS DO YOU FULLY EXPECT THEIR TESTOSTRON LEVELS TO BE SUBNORMAL U OR ARE YOU SOMETIMES SEEING OBEAST PEOPLE WALKING IN WITH YOU KNOW HIGH TESTOSTRONE U AND THE REASON I MASKING THIS IS NOT TO CREATE CONFUSION IS THAT I THINK THAT EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHOIS THINKING ABOUT SPERM QUALITY AND TESTOSTRON LEVELS AND THIS APPARENT DECLINE THE TRN O FIGO YOU KNOWOCAE WHAT CAN WE DO IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE HEALTH METRICS THAT ARE GOING TO F COURSE INCREASE FERTILITY BUT FOR THOSE THAT DON'T WONT HAVE KIDS OR ALREADY HAVE KIDS ARE GOING TO AT LEAST MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE VITALITY IS OBESITY REALLY VO THING TO AVOID SO IS THERE A NOT ONE FOR ONE BUT IS THEIR TYGHT CORRELATION BETWEEN OBESITY AND TESTOSTROM LEVELS I WOULD SAY THAT YOU CANNOT PREDICT I THINK THAT SORT IT WOULD BE THA TAKE HOME AND SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW MORE INFORMATION IS ALWAYS BETTER YOU KNOW ON I SEE PATIENTS AND CLINEC UM YOU KNOW SOME PATIENTS OR WALKING AROUND YU KNOW WITH YUEVERYTHING IS TOTALLY NORMAL THEY VERY HEALTH THE ALL THE NUMBERS COME IN AT THE NORMAL RANGE BUT SOMETIMES WHEN MEN YOU KNOW LOOK TOTALLY NORMAL THEY TALKD ABOUT TAKING CARE OF THEIR LIFE THEY EXERCISEING OF FIVE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK THEIR TESTOCHAN LEVELS CAN BE VERY WELL SO EVEN TE SPITE YOU KNOW HAVING WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER SHOULD REALLY GIVE THEM YOU KNOW SYMPTOMS M THEY'RE ABLE TO COMPENSATE YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY'VE LIVE THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT NORMAL IS NOW WE GET THEM YOU KNOW TO CERT OF NORMAL LEVELS THE LOT OF TIMES THEY FEEL BETTER AGAIN CAS TAD NO IDEA HOW THEY SHOULD FEEL U BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST SORT OF IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY YOU KNOW SHOULD BE SCREENED I THINK THAT YOU KNOW TESTOSTROND SEAMAN QUALITY THERE'VE BEEN SHOWN TO EVEN BE BAROMETERS OF HEALTH UM SO YOU KNOW MEN WITH LOWER TESTOCTUM LEVELS OF HIGHER RISK OF NO HEART DISEASE DIBES MORTALITY THE SAME STUDIES EXISTS FOR SEMEN QUALITY AS WELL U AND YOU KNOW AGAIN THEY MAY HAVE SORT OF A SIMILAR RELATIONSHIP AND EXPLANATION WHY THAY MADE BE BUT I THINK IT'S HARDE JUST PREDICT YOU KNOW BASED ON APPEARANCE WHAT YOU KNOW TESTOSHENILL BE WHAT SEMEN QUATO BE WHAT TESTICULAR FUNCTIONW'LL BE WITHOUT ACTUALLY GETTING SOME OBJECTIVE DATA AND ACTUALY IF YOU LOOK AT THE TREND OF TES OF SEMEN QUALITY TO CLINE OVER TIME CON TO GETTING BACK TO SOME OF THOSE EARLIER POINT YOU'RE MAKING IF YOU WERE TO OVERLAY THAT ON THE KNOWN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OBISITY EM ITS EFFECTS ON SEMEN QUALITY THAT ACTUALLY DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE WHOLE DECLINE  THE YOU KNOW THE PROPORTED DECLINE IT SEMEN UALITIES ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT BUT IF YOU JUST IF YOU WERE TO SAY WELL WHAT WOULD WE EXPECT IF YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT U NICAUS WE ARE ABLE TO TRACT EXACTLY HOW MUCH FATTER WE ARE NOW THEN WE USED TO BE THAT ACTUAL EXPLAINS ABOUT A TEN PER CENT THE CLIME SO I THINK THERE IS THENATOUR PLAIN SOMETHING MORE U AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN JISTIDENTIFY MY HIGH WHAT ARE THE DUS AND DON'T AS IT RELATES TO IDON'T Y USE THE WORD OPTIMIZING IT'S GOTTEN ME INTO TROUBLE BEFORE BECAUSE ERE OPTIMIZE OR OPTIMAL SUGGEST THAT THERE'S AN PERFECT NUMBER THAT ONE SHOULD ALL ATTAIN E IF POSSIBLE BUT IN REALITY AM OPTIMLS A DAY TO DAYTHING UMAT LEAST BUT WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE AVOID IN ORDER TO YET THEIR SPERM QUALITY AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE THEIR TESTOSTERON LEVEL AGAIN HERE I WOIL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL DON'T SAY AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT WANT EXCESSIVE ANDROGEN UM BUT AT THE HIGH END OF NORMAL PERHAPS WOULD BE THE IDEAL FOR MANY PEOPLE WHAT SHOLD POPLE DO WHAT SHOULD THEY AVOID AND HERE I SETTING ASIDE ANY PRESCRIPTION CLINICAL TREATMENTS THAT SUCH AS TESSOSTEROAN INJECTIONS OR THINGS LIKE A CORYONIC GAN ATITROPE CUMAN CUARYONI CANATITROPE AND THINKS WE CAN TALK ABOUT LIBIT LATER BUT WHAT SHOULD EVERY MAIL BE DOING IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THESE HEALTH PERAMETERS YESO I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME RISK FACTORS THAT WE DO LIKE START WITH SEMEN QUATY SO WE TALKED ABOUT HEAT I THINK THAT'S A BIG ONE SO LIKE HOTUBSANAS TRYING AVOID THOSE H EAN A LIKE DAT ON SEA WARMERS ANY TIME YOU KNOW WE CANNOT GET THIS EXTERNAL HEAT SOURCE TO THE SCROTUM YOU KNOW THE TESTACLES ARE OUTSIDE THE BODY CAUSE THEY NEED TO BE A LITTLE COOLER O ANYTHING THAT WARMS THEM UP CAN CERTAINLY BE A PROBLEM COULD I JUST A BRIEFLY INTERRUP THERE AM TOASK A WE'VE DONE EPISODES ON SANA AND SOME OF HEALTH BENEFITS OF SANA A IS IT SUFFICIENT FOR SOMEBODY TO BRING IN A COLD PACK TO THE SANA AND PUT THAT THEIR GROIN I ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I DO WHEN I GO INTO THE SANA A AND I HAVE SUGGESTED THE SON POD CASTS I'M NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE HEAT AS YOU MENTION IS BAD FOR SPERM NOT QUITE AS BAD FOR TE STASTRONE LEVELS BUT IS IT ALSO TRUE THAT HEATING THE TESTICAL TOO MUCH IS GENERALLY BAD FOR INDECRON FUNCTION AND MAILS AND THEREFORE WOULD IF ONE IS GOING TO GO INTO A HOT SANA FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE TO ESSENTIALLY COOL THE SCRODOLARIA YOU I MEAN I THINK THE PREMATIGENISIS ORE SPERM PRODUCTION IS CERTAINLY ALLOW MORE SENSITIVE YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN WHAT A THWART THE EFFECTS OF EXTERNAL HEAT WITH A COOLING PACK I THINK IT MAKE SENSE THERE ARE STUDIES THAT HAVE LOOKED AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO COOL THE SCROTUM AND COMPAREYOU A STEMEN QUALITY BEFORE AND OUT OR AND THERE IS SOME DATO THAT MAY HELP A IT GESS THE PENS HOLL ONGER GAN SPEND IN THE SANA AND HOW COLD YOU KNOW THAT PACK IS GIN TA REMAIN SO ICE PACK AND IN THE SANA FOR TWENTYT OF FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND HIS ICE PACKS STILL COLD AFTERWARDS YET THEY ACTUALLY SELL AND BY THE WAY HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TOING THESE COMPANIES BUT THEY AVUALLY SELL COLD PACKS THAT ARE DESIGN TO BE WORN IN YOUR SHORT SO IF YOU GO TO A YOU KNOW I'LL GO TO A RUSSIAN BONYA EVERY ONCE A WHILE NOW I GUESS I'M OUTING MYSELF YES I HAVE BUT YES I HAVE A COLD PACK IN MY SHORTS WHEN I GO TO THE RUSSIAN MONIA A BUT A BUT THEY HAVE A A SORT OF AN INSOLATION SO THAT YOUR THE COL THE VERY COLD SURFACE IS COLD ENOUGH BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT UP IN CONTACT WITH THE SCROLDL SKIN BECAUSE THAT COULD GET A I'M GOING TO MAKE A BAD CHOKE AND SAY I CAUN GET STICKY A THAT SITUATION YOU YOU DON'T WANT IT GET B SO COLD THAT IT ACTUALLY WOULD STICK TO THE SKIN AND THEN IT COULD PETENTIALY DAMAGE THE SKIN WHEN YOU TRYINGT REMOVE THE COL PAC SO T HAS A THIN INSULATING LAYOR UM AND A YAH THAT'S ESETIALLY WHAT IT IS YO ME FROST SPITE TO THE SCROTUM IS NOT THEORETICAL COULD CERTAINLY HAPPEN SO YOU DO WANT TO BE CAREFUL SO I MEAN A THEORY THAT SHOULD BE THAT SHOULD BE ADEQUATE THE SORT OF TE NO TO DECREASE THE RISK OF THAT PARTICULAR EFFECT UM OU KNMIGHT KEEP COMING BACK TO HEALTH HOW IMPORTANT MATAS TO MAINTAIN AM YOU KNOW ADEQUATES FIRM PRODUCTION BECAUSE I THINK YE'S TWO VERY LENGTH YOU NEVER BEEN STUDIES IT SHOW THAT MEN WITH MORE COMERMAN CONDITION SO BESCITY HYPROTENSION HYPEROLOBEDEMIAS THESE SORT OF STACKED UP WE SEE A DECLINE AND TESTICULAR FUNCTIONS SO LOWER TESTOSTRO LOBELS AND LOWER SFIRM QUALITY SO I THINK YOU KNO TAKING THE OWNERSHIP OF YOUR YOUR HEALTH I THINK IS IMPORTANT AS WELL EM YOU KNOW LOT OF TIMES UM FORTILITY TENTS TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST TOUCH POINTS THAT SOME MEN HAVE WITH HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE GENERALLY WHAT BRINGS MN TO THE DOCTOR ITS USUALLY PAIN OR TE KNO KIND OF A PROBLEM UM SO YOU KNOWG MEN ARE IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES GETTING READY TO START A FAMILY OR FORTIES IN SOME CASES SOMETIMES THEY HAVEN'T YOU HAVE SEEN A PRIMARY CARIDOFRISE TO SOME OF THESE THINGSE IN SOME THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED YET O I THINK ME NO THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO START THAT I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT TOO UM AND THEN I KNOW YOU DO'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT TESTOSTRON BUT TESTOSTRON HIS ACTUALLY A FIRGHLY COMMOND PROBLEM THAT WE SEE AND FRATILITY CLINICS EM I WOULD SAY THAT YOU  ESTIMATE SAY MAY BE ABOUT ONE AND TWENTY AND FERTILE MEN ARE THAT WAY BECAUSE OF TESTOSTRON SO I THINK WHEN YOU KNOW PEOPLE GET TESTOSTROM DIFFERENT PLACES AND HOPEFULLY Y KNOW WHATEVER PRORIETOR YOU'RE GETTING IT FROM TELLS YOU THAT ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS EM IS LOWER SPIRM PRODUCTIONS ACTIL BEN TESTED AS A CONTRACEPTIVE AND YOU KNOW WITH SOME OTHER HEGENS IT CAN ACTI TO BE FAIRLY EFFECTIVE SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW IF MEN ARE STARTING TESTOSTRO THER DOING IT FOR THE RIGHT REASON THEY'RE DOING IT SAFELY I THINK I ABOT TESTOSTRO AN REPLACEMENT THERIPE ALTHOUGH I SAWE WERE TILKING ABOUT BEFOR WE START RECORDING I I AM REALLY ON A PUSH NOW TO RENAME UM WHAT PEOPLE CALL T ARE T TESTOSTR REPLACEMENT THERABY BECAUSE INDEED SOME PEOPLE OF LOW TESTOSTRON AND NEED IT REPLACED  ARE IN TIRT BUT I THINK WHAT YOURE REFERRING TO I I'M NOT MISTAKEN IS THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY MILLIONS OF YOUNG MEN AND OLDER MEN TAKING EXOGENOS TOSTSTRON INJACTIONS CREAMS PILLS PELLITS YOU N ANY NUMBERD NASAL SPRAYS NOW YOU KOW ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT A ROUTS OF DELIVERY OF EXTOGINUS A TESTOSTRON AND THAT A DRAMATICALLY REDUCES ONCE'S INDOGENOUS TO STOSTRON PRODUCTION AND DRAMATICALLY REDUCES ONE'S SPERM COUNT AND MABE E EVEN QUALITY MAY BE TALK ABOUT THE SOLOBIT LATER BUT MAYBE EVEN CAN THET THEIRS I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT CAN PERHAPS INTRODUCE A DIONE FRAGMENTATION  WITHIN THE REMAINING VIABLE SPER MUSWELL SO DO I HAVE THAT CRECT YOUR SAYING THAT THAT YOU SEE ONE AND TWENTY MEN HAVE ISSUES WITH FRATILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING TESTOSTRO SO THEIR TESTSTRO LEVELS PRESUMABLY ARGN BEHIGH AND NORMAL OR MORE BUT THEY ARE DOING PRESUMABLY NOT TESTOSTROM REPLACEMENT THERAPY BUT THEYRE DOING WHAT I CALL TESTOSTRON AUGMENTATION THERARE BE MEANING THEY WERE SOMEWHERE IN THE THREE HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED NANOGRAMS FOR DUST LEADER RANGE BUT DECIDED TO STARTAKING TESTOSTRON ANYWAY AND THEN THEIRE THEIR SPERM COUNT ESSENTIALLY DIMINISHES TO NILL WORE CLOSE TO IT IN SOME CASES YET SO I MEAN I THINK THERE'S VERIOUS REASON THY YO TAKE TESTOSTRON I THINK HE NAS SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TREATED YOU KNOW YEARS AGO AND SO THEY DO NEED A REPLACE TESTOSRONIUKNOW  BUT SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR OGMENTATION I DUST YU TO SAY TESTOSTRON THERAPY TO SON  YOURE KILL THE ARE I LIKE THAT THAT'S BETTER THAN THE T E T WHICH DOESN'T HOW VERY GOOD OKE JUST TESTOSTRON THERAPY YBUT IF YOU HAD YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WE TAKE A HUNDRED OF MY INFERTILE PATIENTS THAT COME IN TO SEE ME AN CLINET AT LEAST FIVE OF THOSE MEN WILL BE INFERTILE BECAUSE THEIR ON TESTOSTRON THERAPY AND SOME OF EM DO HAVIONU O HAVE THAT SUSPICION THEY SAY YOU KNOW MAND LEVEL WITH YOU THIS IS WHY MY LEVELS ARE PRO BALE LOW BUT A LOT OF MEN WERE NOT TOLD BACK YOU KOW WHEN THEY STARTED THERE SO I THINK CERTAINLY FOR REPRODUCTIVE AGED MAN THAT'S IN A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE U BECAUSE THERE CAN BE SOM OTHER BENO WAYS THAT WE KIND OF MAINTAINS FORM PRODUCTION I THINK SPIRM CRA PRESERVATION IS A GOOD OPTION FOR THESE MEN AS WELL UM OR THERE MAY BE OTHER THERAPIES THEY CAN THINK ABOUT JUST BECAUSE OF REPRODUCTOVTOXASY WHOWHAT ABOUT UM H C G HUMAN CORYONIC GANATATROP AND I HEARABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE GO ON TESTOSTRON THERAPY WHO TAKE H C G EVERY OTHER DAY OR SO UM TYPICALLY THE DOSAGES THAT I HEREABOUT BECAUSE PEOPLE WRITE T ME ABOUT THE STUFF ALL THE TIME REALLY 'S ONE THE MOST COMMONLY ASK QUESTIONS UM I GET MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MANY TOPICS BUT I WOULD SAY A FOOL TEN TO TWENTY PER CENT OF THEM ARE ABOUT UM PENISES OR CESTOSTRA UM THOSE PERFECTRIGT EXACTLY UM SO A NUMBER OF THOSE UM GUYS WHO ARE TAKING TESTOSTROM WILL BE PRESCRIBED H C G TO UM STIMULATE SPERM PRODUCTION UM INDOGENOSPERN PRODUCTION TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY SPERIM PRESUMEE BECAUSE THEY EITHER WANT TO CONCEIVE OR INTENDING TO CONCEIVE IN THE FUTURE IS THAT THE BEST LINE OF TREATMENT FOR MAINTAINING FRATILITY WHILE PEOPLE ARE TAKING TESTOSTRON THERAPY YE IT'S ONER THE THERAPIES THA WE USE AND I THINK CAM MORK WELL YOU ARE JUST A LODOS UM USUALLY EN FOR THOSE THAT TAT KNOW FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND UNITS EVERY OTHER DAY IS USUALLY ANIQUITE AS WE ALL KNOW QUALITY NUTRITION INFLUENCES OF COURSE OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR COGNEVE FUNCTIONING OUR MEMORY OUR ABILITY TO LEARN NEW THINGS AND TO FOCUS AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF HIGH QUALITY NUTRITION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ENOUGH VIDEMENS AND MINERALS FROM HIGH QUALITY UNPROCESSED OR MINIMLY PROCESS SOURCES AS WELL AS ENOUGH PROBIOTICS AND PREBODICS AND FIBRE TO SUPPORT THASICALLY ALL THE CELLAR FUNCTIONS IN OUR BODY INCLUDING THE GOP MICROBIO NOW I LIKE MOST EVERYBODY TRY TO GET OPTIMAL NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS IDEALLY MOSTLY FROM MINIMALY PROCESSE OR NON PROCESS FOODS HOWEVER ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE FACE IS GETTING ENOUGH SERVINGS OF HIGH QUALITY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY AS WELL AS FIVER AND PROBIOTICS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY THOSE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S WHY WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE LONG BEFORE I EVER HAD A PODCAST I STARTED DRINKING A G ONE AND SO 'M DELIGHTED THE A G ONE IS SPONSORING THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL DRINK A G ONE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES ALL OF MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT PROVIDES INSURANCE THAT I GET THE PROPER AMOUNTS OF THOSE VITEMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBER TO INSURE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE YOU CAN GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOKCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THE'RE GIVING AWAY FI FRE TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIN D THREE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THAT SPECIAL OFFER SO IF SOMEBODY IS NOT TAKING TO STOSTERON EXOGUNOUSLY THEY GOTTEN THERE A BODY FAT LEVEL DOWN TO A POINT WHERE THERE NOT CONSIDERED O BE SITHER HOPEULY DOING SOME CARY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE EACH WEEK MAY BE DOING SO SPORT RESOME RESISTANCE TRAINING TO EM A WITH THE INTENTION OF MAINTAINING ALL AROUND GOOD HEALTH STAVE OFF YOU SRUBER OF ASCULAR CARDY OF ASCULAR ISSUES WHAT IRE SOME OF THE OTHER DON'TS I'V BEEN GOING TO ASSUME THAT SMOKING CIGARETTES OR VAPING CIGARETTES IS BAD THERE ANY STUDIES THAT LOOKD SPECIFICALLY AT VAPING AND SPRM QUALITY OR TO STOSTRONE LEVELS EM AND IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT I SMOKING CIGARETTES IS GOOD FOR TOSTOSTRON LEVELS ER SPERM PRODUCTIONS I'M GUESSING TH ANSWERS NOW I FEEL LIKE NOWADAYS WE JUST SAY DON'T SMOKE EM BUT THE DATAE THE DATA WHO KNOWS MAY BE NEKATINE TON HELPSPURM I HAVE NO IDEA RI A IT'S POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE DATE ON THAT YET BUT YE MAN I THINK I YOUR POINT I THINK LIFESTOU FACTORS ARE CERTAINLY A BIG ONE AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW POTENTIONALLY EM YOUKNOW CAN UNHELPY HABITS O SMOKING IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING YOU SHAL NOT DO THERE HAVE BEEN LENOLOTS O STUDIES TO DO LINK THAT TO YOU KNOW LOWER QUALITY BEGAN ALL THE DIFFERENT MEASURES THAT WE LOOK AT I'M ALSO LOOKING AT FERTILITY THESE MEN TEN TO HAVE A LONGER TIME TO GET PREGNENT IM ALCOHOL I THINK IT'S ANOTHER VERY COMMON QUESTION AGET ASKED AS WELL AND I THINK FOR THAT THERE'S YOU KOW I THINK LESS OF A STRONG ASSOCIATION THAT WE'VE SEEN SO THERE EM YOUKNOWTHERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT VERY HIGH LEVELS OF ALCOHON I GUESS THAT SORT OF SUBJECTIVE WHAT SOME WOULD CONSIDER HIGHER OR NOT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET ABOVE ME BE TWENTY DRINKS A WEEK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EFFECTS BUT YOU HEVS A LOT OF DRINKIN I WOULD THINK THAT'S LOT E BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T BUT YET I DIDN'T EPISODE ON ALCAL I THINK ANYTHING MORE THAN TWO I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GIN EM O BULK AT THIS BUT YOU I THINK ANY MORE THAN TWO DRINKS PER WEEK AS WHERE YOU START TO SEE SOME NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON SOME HEALTH PERAMETERS BUT OU NO I'M NOT A TITOLERSA  YE EM BUT WHEN YOU GET TO THIS TWENTY DRINK THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED TO SEE SOME EFFECTS ON SEAMEN QUALITY BUT THE OYOU KNOW THE THING ABOUT THAT IS USUALLY OF THESE MEN ARE DRINKING TWENTY THE'RE DOING OTHER THINGS TO SMOKING THERE CAN BE OTHER DRUG USE AS WELL SO IT'HARD TO TEASE THAT AL BUT IN GENERAL THAT'S YOU KNOW I THINK CERTAINLY ANYTHING IN MODERATION IS PROBABLY OAK YOUNOW I'S PROBABLY BETTER AND SO THAT'S HOW I COUNSIL PATIENCE I THINK YOU AGAIN IT'S VERY RARE THAT I SEE MEN THAT ARE THAT LEVEL BUT I CERTAINY LET HEM KNOW WHAN I DO EM THERE'S SOME NEW DAT TO COMING OUT OF THAT WE'VE STARTED TO WORK ON LOOKING AT IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES TO ALCOHALSO YOU KNOW SOME EAST ASENTS HAVE MUTATION THAT LEADS TO FLUSHING EM AND SO THAT MAY PUT THOSE MEN AT HIERUS WHEN THEY MIX ALCOHOL WE MAY SEE SOME YOU KNOW SLIGHTLY LOWER AS FRM PRAMETERS YOU MEANG SKIN FLUSHING BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE ALCALTE HYDROGIAN THEAVE GAD YAA E AND IS IT IE IVE HEARD ABOUT THAT IN ASIAN CULTURES IS THERE EM ANASIEN POPULATION ESCUSE ME BUT IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT OTHER POPULATIONS MIGHT HAVE SLIGHT VARIANCE ON ALCALL DEHYDROGENAS THAT PERAPS MAYBE THEY DON'T LACK IT ALTER GETHER BUT THEY HAVE ION'T KNOW  THEIR HYPOMORS FOR WHATEVER GENE MAKES I'LL CALL THE HIDROGENATOND THEREFORE THEY DON'T METABOLIZE IT AS WELL AND THEREFORE THE TOXIC FORM OF ALCOL IS ACTIVE IN THEIR SYSTEM LONGER IS THRE ANY EVIDENCE FOR THAT NOT THE GET YOUR EXACTLY RIGHT I MAN I THINK THE ONE THAT WE THINK ABOUT IS YE SAYS AN CULTURES WHERE IT CAN BE OU KNOW DEPENDING ON ANOTHER REASION LIKE I CHINESE TIMONESE POBY ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY PER CENT O THE POPULATION HAS YOU KNOMUTATION THE ALED EACH TUGENE BUT OTHER POPULATIONS I AND PEOPLE OF AFRICAN ANCESTRY THERE'S A A RATE IMUTATION I THINK  NO COUN REMEMBER THE EXACT PERCENSI BUT THINK OF FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS IS SOME A INDIVIDUAL O THESPANIC ANCESTRY ASKCONAZY JEWISH ANCESTRY SO IN THIS PARTICULAR GENE THEREIS I MUTATION NOT THE SAME ONE THAT E STATIONS HAVE BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK IT GETS TO WY MUTATION YOU KNOW WHERE WE SEE SORT OF NEGATIVE FFECTS WOULD PERSIST AND THE HYPOTHESES THAT YOU KNOW BELENIA GO PRETEND PROTENTIALLY YOU KNOW GAVE SOME SORT OF BENEFIT FOR MAYBE INVEXASEASE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO SISTINCT BYBROSIS WHY YOU KN AGAIN THIS MUTATION WOULD PERSIST IN OUR POPULATION IF THERE'S NOT YOU KNOW RE ME NO SOME SORT OF ADVANTAGE AT TO THOSE CARRYING IT BUT WE DO SEE ANOTHER YOU KNOW OTHER MEN AS WELL SO I THINK IF YOU KNOW IT SIMPLE QUESTION DO YOU FLUSH IF YOU FLUSH THEN MAYBE ALCOHOL MAY HAVE OU NA MORE OF A A HARM THAN THAN SOME ONE ELSE AND THEN YOU KNW  FORT OF GETTING ALONG THE LINES I THINK DRUG USES ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD TRYING YOU KOW WEWE DO CONSULPATIONS ABOUT CAUSE I CAN ALSO NEGUABLY FECT E MEQUALITY YOU THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT OQE MODERATION IS BEST BUT IF SOMEBODY HAD THE OPTION TO EITHER NOT DRINK OR DRINK IN MODERATION THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DRINK WOULD THAT BE EVEN BETTER STHERE ANY EVIDENCE FOR THAT I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE NOWADAYS WE TAKE THE STANCE THAT AM NOT SMOKING AT ALL IS BETTER THAN SMOKING A LITTLE BIT I SHULD WHEN I WAS A POSTOCK AT STAMFORD FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE YES TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO A END OF TWO THOUSAND TEN A YOU COULD STILL SMOKE ON THE STAMFOR CAMPAS I'M NOT A SMOKER BUT THERE WAS THIS COLLECTION OF I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT I SAY HERE THERE WAS A PARTICULAR GROUP ON CAMPAS OF POSTOCXS AND GRADUETS SOON THAT WOULD U YOU KNOW THAT WE COLONIZE THIS LAREA OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND SMOKE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD SMOKE THAT WAS EVENTUALLY UM ELIMINATED AS A POSSIBILITY YOU CAN'T SMOKE ON SAMFOR CAMPA AS FAR AS I KNOW BUT THEYWOULD SMOKE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL I SHALL ALOVE THE HOSPITAL WORKERS WOULD YOUON'T TAKE A CIGARETTE ON THEIR BRAK THIS IS VERY COARINY Y EXACTLY YEAND IN THIS WIST COMMON ALL OVER THE COUNTRY RIGHT THIS ISN'T UNIQUE TO STAMFORD BUT NOWADAYS YOU JUST DON'T SEE THAT UM BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALOWD UM AND WE HEAR DON'T SMOKE IT'S TERRIBLE FOR EXQUISY AND EVERYTHING EVERY OTHER LETTER THE ALPBAT WITH I'LCALL UM WE TEND TO HEAR THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DRINK DRINK IN MODERATION UM'S NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT NUMBER THAT IS BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ZEROWILE CALL IS BETTER FOR SPERMAN ENDICRAN HEALTH THEN ANY ALCOHOL OR IS THAT NOT NOT A FAIR ASSUMPTION I MEAN I THINK TIT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW THAT YOU POINT ABOUT TOBACCO IS AN EXCELLENT ONE CAUSE IVTHINK ANY SMOKING IS BAD M BUT A'LCL I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA FOR YE AND SO I THINK IT'S ATHEARTED TARDER FOR ME TO MAKE THAT RECOMMENDATION TO PATIENCE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOUNO' PEOPLE DO IT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS UM AND IF IT'S NOT NECTERALLY GOING TO HELP THEM YOU KNOW ALL HARM THEM IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS OR OTHER THINGS EM YE I USELY I USUALLY GIVE THEM THE MODERATION ONE UNLESS AGAIN FOR THEM THE VERY HIGH DRINKERS I DON'T LY TALK ABOUT THAT UM YOU MENTION OTHER DRUG USE UM I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT U UNLESS PRESCRIBED FOR SI POSTSURGICAL PAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT PENZA DA AZOPENES HEROINE OPIATES OF ANY KIND UM AR JUST BAD FOR SPERMAN TESTOSTRONE I THINK WE CN PROBABLY MAKE THAT A SHORT DISCUSSION RIGHT H YE  I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OF THAT WOULD BE GOOD UM FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH YE THAT'S TRIMBIN THERE'S AGAIN YOU'D IMAGINE OR MAYMAYBE NOT BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DATA ON IT UM IT BE DIFFICULT TO ENROL OR MAY BE EASY TO UNROLL BUT A LOT OF THE STHUDIES HAV NOT BEEN DONE A BUT THERE'S LIMITED ONES OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE AND RE HAVE A WHERE THEY HAVE SHOWN YOU KNOW THESE ASSOCIATIONS WITH PE NO ATTICS OR USERS AND LOWER QUALITYE SO A YON THAT'S A WE TALKED PATIONS WHAT ABOUT CANABAS I DIDN'T EPISODE THIS PODCAST ABOUT CANABAS AND I DID HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF CANABAS I ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THAT VERY HIHT S CANNABAS A MAY PREDISPOSED AESPECIALLY YOUNG MALS TO LATER PSYCHOTIC EPISODES THERE MORE AND MORE DATA COMING OUT ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME I A GOT A LOT OF FLACK FOR FOR SAYING THAT BUT THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE DATA A AND A I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE USE CANNABAS A RECREATIONALLY A AND IN A KIND OF PSEUTOH THERAPEUTIC WY I SAY PSEUOTHERAPEUTIC BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE USED CANABAS TO MANAGE THEIR ANXIETY AND IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ALCOHOL A FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CANABAS USE AND TO STOSTRONE AND SPERM PRODUCTION WOR I SHOULD SAY SPIRM QUALITY EXCUSE ME YES O THIIS ALSO A VERY COMMON QUESTION A EGAIN WITH WAVE OF LEGALIZATION ACROSS THE COUNTRAVIC MORE AND MORE MEN AND WOMEN ARE EXPOSED TO IT A SO AGAIN THERE'S DATA THAT THE MORE MEN ARE EXPOSED TO CAN LEAD TO SOME HARM IN TERMS OF PER MORPHOLOGY AND SPERM NUMBERS AS WELL A YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SORT OF LANDMARK STUDIES WAS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED MEN AND HAD FOUND THAT MEN THAT USED CANNABAS DAILY HAD SIGNIFICANT LOWER CONCENTRATION MOTILITY MORPHOLOGY COMPARED TO THOSE THAT DIDN'T USE IT A SO I THINK THAT'S GENERALLY HOW MEN ARE COUNSELLED BUT THERE'S ALSO YOU KNOW OTHER DATA THAT SHOWS REALLY A NOLLEFACT AND I THINK THAT IT IT GOES IN TO PROBALY THE COMPOSITION HOW MEN ARE TAKING IT THE FREQUENCY BECAUSE THE LOT OF THAT DATAS NOT WELL TEASED OUT IN A LOT OF THESE STUDIES A SO YOU KNO I THINK I I SOMETIMES STRUGGLE WITH THIS WITH PATIENCE BECAUSE SOME OF A M MARK TAKING IT FOR WO KNOW YOU SOME WHAT THEY CONSIDER LEGITIMATE REASONS ANXIETY'SLEE PAIN AND IF THERE'S NOT SORT OF BURY CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT IT'S GOING TO HELP AND THEIR TAKING IT MAY BE LOWER THAN THE THRESHOLD WERE I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOOD DAVITIT'LL CAUSE HARM YOU KNOW I GUESS I'M I TRY AN TO BE SORT OF HONEST ABOUT WHERE WE ARE BUT I THINK WITH A LOT OF THINGS RELATED A SPIRM I THINK AR THEIR LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IS NOT GREAT ARE THERE ANY COMMON OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATIONS THAT CAN NEGTIVELY IMPACT SPERM QUALITY AND ORATESTOSTRONE THINGS LIKE A NONSTERDANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUGS TALANALL THADVILLE TYPE STOFF A THE UNIV OPROFINACY TO MENIFIND AM THINGS OF THAT SORT THAT I AND OTHERS MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF I'M NOT I'M NOT PROVING FOR ANTHING IN PARTICULAR HERE I JUST II KNOW THAT AU YOU A LOT OF OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS HAVE A FACTS THAT WERE IS SIMPLY NOT AWARE OF YE ME I THINK WE PROBAB LEE MORE DATA BUT I THINK CURRENTLY WE THINK ALL THOSE ARE SAFE I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE PETUITARY PETUITORY GLAN AS MANY THE LISTENERS OF THE SPADCAS OR E KNOWS GLAN THAT RECEIVE SIGNALS FROM THE BRAIN AM THE GLAND SITS NEAR THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH A NO THING THAT'S FAIR AM AND RELEASES CRITICAL HORMONES INTO THE BLOOD STREAM THAT CONTROL THE OUTPUT OF TESTOSTRONE FROM THE TESTES AS WELL AS OUTPUT OF HORMONES FROM OTHER GLANCE AM I KNOW A UMBER OF PEOPLE AND PLAYING SPORTS LIKE FOOTBALL OR RUGBY ER EVEN LACROSS OR EVEN SACKER I'VE READ THERE ARE DATE ON THIS YOU KNOW THEIR HEADING THE SACKER BALL QUITE A LOT OR MARSHAL ARTS OR THEY GET A HEAD INJURY AT SOME POINT AND A I CERTAINLY HEAR A LOT FROM PEOPLE WHO PLAYED THESE HIGH CONTACT SPORTS AND THAT TO THEIR SURPRISE LATER THEY HAVE DIMINISHED TESTOSTRON LEVELS I ALSO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF MILITARY GROUPS THAT TALK ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW THAT THEY LEAVE AND MAY BE ITS FROM  COMBAT RELATED STR ASS ET CETERA BUT U THEY WONDER WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANY TRAMATIC HEAD INJURY OR MAYBE PETUITARY INJURY RELATED EM IMPERAMENT TO THE REPRODUCTIVE ACCESS THAT INCLUDES BRAIN PRETUITARY AND THE TESTIS DO YOU SEE THAT EM AND IF SOMEBODY PLAYED A CONTAXPORT IN PARTICULAR CONTAXPORT WHERE THE HEAD WAS HID OR THEY WERE HITTING THINGS WITH THEIR HEAD OFTEN U WHICH THEY HAVE A TB IER HAD A T B I THAT UN THER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CAN BE IMPERIT THAT'S FACT A FASCINATING EM I HAVE I HAVE NOT I MEAN I THINK YOUMUST INTERESTING I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT THE PETUITARY DOES YEUVOVEUSLY COVERED THIS BEFORE BUT IT DOES GO TO A LOT OF ARTHERITIES I MEAN SO YOU KNOW FOR YOUR LISTENERS YOU KNOW THAT PETUITOR PRODUCES TWO HORMONS ELATE SLUTINIZING HORMEN AND EFFISATES FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE WHICH THEN STIMULATES THE TESTACL SO THAT LUTINIZING HORMENA HORMON STIMULATES THE LAT EGCELLS TO MAKE TESTOCTRONE AND THEN THER POLICAL STIMULATING HORMONER EFISTATE STIMULATES SPERN PRODUCTION I'M SO BOTH OF THOSE ARE VERY KEY YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION AND INTERESTINGLY WHEN EXOGINOUS TESTOCTRON IS USED YOU KNOW IT SHUTS DOWN THAT ACIS AS YOU KNOW SO WE GET LESS OF THESE GANATITROPENS I ELE EFISAGE EM TO STIMULATE THE TESTACAL EM AND THE OTHER SORT OF REASON THAT FORM PRODUCTION IS LOST WITH EXOGINOUS TO SOCE RENUSES IT IS ACTUALLYTHE INTERTESTIGLAR TESTOCTRONE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN SYRUM LEVELS SO YOU KNOW OUR SYRUM LEVELS ARE YOU KNOW BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED ANRSTRODESLATER ON AVERAGE BUT IN THE TESTICLE OF PIE TENFOLD HIGHER AT LEAST SO WHEN MEN ARE GIVEN EXOINOUS TESTOSTRA AND NOT PRUSING THEIR OWN THE LEVELS OF TESTACERAN INTHE TESTACLE WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR SPERN PRODUCTION ARE MUCH MUCH LOWER EM BUT ITS IT'S INTERESTING THIS I THINK EM I AM NOT AWARE OF FRTHATRUM DRAMATIC INTURIES WOULD WOULD DO THAT EM THAT'S GOD TO KNOW I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE NON AND D E CRIN NON CHEMICAL SO A FACTS ON SPERM QUALITY AND TESTOSTRON LEVEL SO HERE I'M THINKING ABOUT A BUNCH OF NEW STORIES YOU'RE HEARD A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW BICYCLE SEAT PRESSURE ON THE PROSTRATE OR MAYBE WAS OTHER OTHE PORTIONS OF THE UM EY WAS A A NERVOUS RUNNING TO THE PEANIS ITSELF AM WERE SURROUNDING AREAS MAY THOS PELVIC FLOR RELATED AN SOMEHOW YOU'LL TELL US I'M SURE A WAS IMPAIRING SEXUAL FUNCTION WAS IT IMPAIRING SEXUAL FUNCTION IN ANYWAY BY IMPAIRING TESTOSTRO LEVELS CUTTING OFF BLOOD FLOW TO THE TESTES A AND HERE PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANTHING TO ASK STRAIGHT OFF IS AM IS WRITING A BICYCLE BAD FOR A MALE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INSEXUAL HEALTH NOW THESE ARE REAT QUESTIONTHIES AGAIN LIVING IN THE BARRY WORKING I THE BARRIA A CYCLING IS VERY VERYT POPULAR SO THSE ARE QUESTIONS THAT I GET A LOT SO I THINK YOU KNEW I IN GENERAL LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ANYTHING IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEART ITSKEN TO BE GOOD FERTILITY SO GOULD DIET IN EXERCISE MAINTAINA GOOD BODYWEIT AND SO I ALWAYS TRY AND ENCOURAGE PHYSICAL FITNESS I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT YOU KNOW IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT SOME PARTICULAR AM ACTIVITIES MAY PUT MEND IN MORE RISK SO I THINK CYCLING COULD BE ONT OF HIM IF I BUT IT WOULD TWERE TO DEPEND ON EXACTLY WHY WE THINK THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM SO I GUESS THE THEORY IS HEAT IF YOU'RE IN THE SADDLE FOR A LONG TIME ENOUG FOR THESE PROLONGED YOU KNOW RIDES THAT MEN TAKE YOU KNOW ON WEAK ENDS YOU KNO HOURS A THAT MAY BE IF THERE'S TOO MUCH HEAT EXPOSURE THAT MAY BE THE MECHANISM WERE SPIRM PRODUCTION WOULD DECLINE SO THERE HAPPEN SOME STUDIES THAT MAY BE FIVE HOURS A WEEK WOULD BE ENA THAT MAY BE TOO MUCH SOFIER ABOVE THAT LEVEL IS FRM COUNCIL SHOWN TO BE LOWER YOUR LESS THAN THAT THAT MAY BE O CASE SO WHEN I TALK THE PATIENTS ABOUT IT A TRYING DIS ENCOURAGEENT NOST STAND UP IN THE SADDLE TO TRY AND AGAIN TO AIR THINGS OUT TO TRY AND DISSIPAY HEAT IF ETHANCE THE MECHANISM ARE NI THINK REGARDING SEXUAL DISFUNCTION A THAT IS THOUGHT TO BE PRESSURE AS YOU'RE ALLUDING TWO SO YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT SADDLE IS CAN FIGURED IDEALLY ALL THE PRESSURE IS PUT ON OUR I SKILL TWUBEROCITIES ARE A SIDBONES THAT'S WHAT I'M SITTING ON NOW BUT ON THE SADDLE YOU KNOW THERE'S I BU SEE COUNT OF THE RIGID NOS AND IF THERE'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON THAT THAT ACTUALLY SQUEEZES BETWEEN THAT IS KUILL TUBEROSITIES WHERE YU KNOW THE MAIN BLOOD FLOAD OF THE PENUST GOES AND THE MAIN NERVE SUPPLY IS TOO AND SO IF THERE'S COMPRESSION ON THIS YOU GET THIS FOR LACK OF BLOOD FLOWER A SCHEMIA AND YOUAN GET A NEUR PRACTCAS WELL IF YOU CRUSH THESE NERVES AND SO THAT OVER TIME CAN LEAD THE PROBLEMS SO YOU IT SOME PATIENCE WILL SAY THAT YO KNW AFTER IS CYCLE YOU KNOW THINGS ARE NUNB DOWN THERE FOR THIRTY MINUTES I'M OR A DAY OR I DON'T GET ERECTIONS FOR THAT SORT OF A SAME MAT A TIME OR SOMETIMES YOU KNOW MEN JU SORT OF YOU KNOW RIDE THROUGH IT EM AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THINGS COME BACK IN A DAY OR TWO SO THAT'S THAT COULD BE THE MECHANISM THERE ARE SOME SADDLES THAT YOU KNW HOPEFE E'LL BE A LITTLE SAFER AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THIS SORT OF FIRST WAS NOTED PROBBY AROUND TWO THOUSAND OR SO AND THERE IS A BIG REDASIGN AND TURNS OF SADDLES ON TR AND MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE YOU ANTATOMICALLY CORRECT TO TRY AND MINIMIZE SOME OF THIS AND THERES YOU KNOW CYCEL FIT THAT CAN BE DONE OR SADDLE FIT RATHER THAT CAN BE DONE TAT SOME OF THE CYCLING SHOPS TO TRYM YOU KNOW LOOK AT YOUR BODY POSITION LOOK AT YOUR SIZE AND TRY ING TO FYING TO SADDLE THAT'S SAFER EM YOU KOW IT NOT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO EVERYBODY I WOULD SAY MAY BE  IF YOU WERE TO EM SERVY CYCLIST MAY BE TWENTY OR THIRTY PER CENT OF MEN AND WOMEN TEND TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS SO I THINK IF YOU ARE HAVING DISCOMFORT AN WHEN YOU CYCLE WHETHER IT BE PAIN NUMBNESS OR YOU NOTICE DISPUNCTION THINK CERTAINLY YOU SHOULD YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT CHANGING SADDLES OR THINK ABOUT CHANGING WRITING STYLE EM YOU THERE'S OTHER STRATEGIES OR SOMETIMES USED BUT YOU KNOW ABSOLULY SOMETHING THAT THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE WARE I MEN TO ASK THIS EARLIER BUT I SEEM TO RECALL A STUDY THAT DREW A A CORRELATION BETWEEN EM AMOUNT OF WALKING AND MAYBE IT WAS SPERM QUALITY BUT I THINK AS TO STOCTERON LEVELS MAYBE SOME OTHER METRICS OF A MALESEXUAL HEALTH IFORGIVE ME I'M NOT RECALLING THE DETAILS NOW  IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT WALKING MORE STANDING MORE MAYBE EVEN USING A STANDING DUSK IS BENEFICIAL FOR A YO CALVICFLOR HEALTH BLOOD FLOW A PROSTRATE HEALTH WHO KNOWS COULD BE ANY IN ALL THOSE THINGS IN SOME WAY THAT IS BENEFICIAL FOR SPERM QUALITY TO STOSTERON LEVEL AND OR OVER ALL MALESEXUAL HEALTH YOU I THINK YOU KNOT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN CHARACTERIZED ACTIVITY IS STEPCONT RIGHT I THINK I NO HAVE A WATCH THAT TELLS ME THAT SOMETHING THAT I LOOK AT EVERY DAY AND THAN A STRIVE FOR IT AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE MORE ACTIVE YOU ARE I IT'S BEEN SHOWN FOR T O LOOKING IT YOU KNOW LARGE NATIONAL DATA POOLS ACROSS DIFFERENT AGE RANGES THAT IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH TESTOSTRON LEVELS SO BEING MORE ACTIVE I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT A THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAN YOU KNOW EVERYBODY CAN DO IT O TRY AND IMPROVE FOR TESTICULAR FUNCTION BROADLY BUT TESTOSTRON SPECIFICALLY AND DO YOU KNOW WHETHER NOT THAT CAN BE SEPARATED OUT FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BEING MORE ACTIVE AND LESS OBS MEANIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S INDEPENDENT OF OF OBCITY IN OTHER WORDS CAN WE INCEND TIVIZED PEOPLE TO WALK MORE UM SIMPLY ON THE ON THE PROMISE OF A IMPROVE SEXUAL HEALTH WELL IN NORNO YOUR SEXUAL HEALTH WILLD BE A DIFFERENT ONE BUT WE CAN I THINK THERE IS TESSOCIATIS ETING TESTOSERON LEVELS AND STEP ACOUNT A CROSS DIFFERENT B M I STRAIGHT OUT SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHETHER YOUR HAVE THE IDEAL BODYWI WHETHER YUAV A FEW POUNDS TO LOSE PERHAPS IF YOU WALK MORE YOU WILL SEE HIGHER LEVELS OF TESTOSTROM AND ANOTHER QUESTION MEN TO ASK EARLIER AND THAN WE CAN A CLOSE THE HATCH ON ON EXOCIONIS TESTOSTRO N THERAPELEASE FOR THE TIME BEING MAY BE WILL COME BACK TO IT IS A ASSUMING THAT SOMEBODY CAN MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SPERM PRODUCTION THROUGH THE USE OF  C G OR SOME OTHER AUTHERABE OR PERHAPS THEY DON'T CARE IF THEIRE STILL MAKING SPIRM BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY HAD CHILDREN OR THEY DON'T CARE TO HAVE CHILDREN MAYBE THEY BANKSPERM IN ANY EVET ASSUMING THAT SOMEBODY TAKES TESTOSTROON THERAPY BECAUSE THEY WERE PRESCRIBED THAT A BUT SAY IN YOUR CLENE MISES USE A UANER CLENICAS AN EXAMPLE AND THEY ARE HAPPY WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THAT AND THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE TRADE OFFS IS THERE ANY INCREASED RISK OF SA PROSTATE CANCER OR OTHER FORMS OF CANCER AND HERE I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT THIS PERSON IS KEEPING THERE O THEIR LIPID LEVELS IN CHECK MYTUS YOU HEARE ABOUT SOME HYPROLIPIDEMIA WITH TESTOSTRON THERAPIES LET'S ASSUME THAT THEYREITHEIRE TAKING A STATNOR THY'R NOT TAKING STAD AND THE'RE GETING IN A CARDIVASCULAR EXERCISE THAT THINGS ARE IN CHECK IN TERMS OF ELDIAL AHED ELLO APO B AN ALL THAT AND THEIR TESTOSTRON LEVELS ARE NO HY NORMAL AND THEIR FEELING BETTER A AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SPERM PRODUCTION CAUSE IT THEYRE EITHER MAINTAINING IT OR IT'S BEEN BANKED OR THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT IS THERE AN INCREASED RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE ANSWERIS NO BUT WHAT'S THE REAL DEAL DOES TAKING TESTOSTRO AN THERAPY ASSUMING ALL OTHER THINGS ARE BEING HELD IN A IN CHECK IN A HEALTHY CHECK DOES IT INCREASE THE RISK OF ANY KIND OF CANCER YET I MEAN THIS IS A ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF NES UROUND TESTOSTRN AND THAT'S ONE OF THEM YOU KNOW THIS THE ORIGIN IS THAT PROSTATE CANCERS THOUGHT TO BE OR IS SORT OF ANDRGEN BEATED YOU KNOW WONT OF THE KNOBALL PRIZE A OUKNOW CAN DECATES AGO WAS AWARDED BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND THAT HEN WE LOWERED MANSTESTOSTRON THE PROSTATE CANCER WOULD REGRESTS DRAMATICALLY SO THAT PUT THAT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TESTOSTRON AND PROSTATE CANCER SO THEN THE CONCERN BECAN IF WE WERE TOO YOU NW EITHER OF PLACE TESTOSTRO OR AUGMENTESTOSTRAN GIVE A MAN TESTOSTRON IS ACCAN A ALTER HIS RISKOR INCREASEIS RISK SO I THINK WE HAVE PRETTY CONVINCING DATA THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE  OTHERS LOTS OF LOGIGINAL DATA SPANNING DECATES WHERE MAN IS GIVEN TESTOSTRON IT DOESN'T CHANGE HIS RISK THE REAS SN'T FOR THAT IN SORT OF SEEMING CONTRADICTO THIS CONTRADICTION RATINE OU KNO PROSTAT YANCER A THERAPE WHERE WE LOWERD HASTOSTRON WHERE IF YOU GIVE A MANTOSOCION DOESN'T CHANGE IS PROSTECANCER RIS IS NOT CERTAIN BUT THERE'S THIS POPULAR MODEL CALLED THE SATURATION MODEL SO THAT ONCE THERE'S ENOUGH TESTOSTERN IN THE BODY AND ITS THAT TENDS TO BE A VERILY LOW LEVEL A THAT ALL THIS SORT OF THE PROSTATE TESTOSTON RECEPTERS YOU CAN OF THINK OF IS HAVE BEEN FILLED SO IF YOU ERE TO GIVE MAN MORE TESTOCOR DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING REGARDING THE PROSTA ANCER PROSTATE GROWTH ANY OF THAT SO IT IS IT IS SAFE WHON WERE LOOKING AT PROSTA ANCERS ISN'T I LIKE TO JUST TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND THANK ONE OF OUR SPONSERS WHICH IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLITES AND NO SUGAR SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONTS NOW PEOPLE OF COURSE HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF REQUIREMENTS FOR SODIUM SO PEOPLE WITH HYGH PRETENSION OR PREHIGH PRETENSION PROBABLY SHOULDN'T INCREASE THEIR SODIUM HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT BY INCREASING THEIR SODIUMEN TAKE THEY ARE ABLE TO FUNCTION BETTER COGNIVELY AND PHYSICALLY N THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SPECIALY PEOPLE ARE FALLING LOW CARBOHYDRATE OR EVEN MODERATE CARBOHYDRATE AND REALLY CLEAN DIETES OFTENTIMES ARE EXSCREETING A LOT OF WATER IN ELECTROLITES ALONG WITH IT AND SIMPLY BY INCREASING THEIR ELECTROLITE INTAKE USING ELEMENT THEY JUST FEEL BETTER AND FUNCTION BETTER I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLITES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND CERTAINLY I DRINK ELEMENT IN MY WATER WHEN I'M IN THE SAUNA AND AFTER GOING IN TE SANA BECAUSE THAT CAUSE IS QUITE A LOT OF SWEATING IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENTE DOC COM SLASH HUBERMAN GETTING BACK TO PROSTATE HEALTH AND A NORAL INERVATION OF THE PENIS AN AND BLOOD FLOW TO THE PENUS YOUU MENTION THE BIKE SE RELATED ISSUES ARE THERE OTHERS THINGS THAT MEN SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PROSTRATE HEALTH STAVE OFF PROSSATE DISEASES AND TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY BLOOD FLOW AND NERL INERVATION OF THE PENIS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AND WILL GET AM INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THOSE REASONS ND IN OUR LATER DISCUSSION YET I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW ALWAYS CAN I THINK OF THE PENUS AS A USER TO LOSE ORGAN SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN ESTRAL YO HAVE TO HAVE SEC BUT YOU N NORMALLY BEGET IRECTIONS EVERY NIGHT SO THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAINED AND IF THERE'S ANY REASON TO SORT OF SUSPECT THAT THAT MAY NOT BE GOING ON A USUALLY IN MY PRACTICE THIT WOULD BE FROM PINISEMS PUBLIC SURGICAL INTERVENTION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETIMES WE CAN INTERVENE TO TRY AND MAINTAIN THAT YOU TULK HIM AOUT SPONTANEOUS ERECTIONS DURING SLEEP R SO AM AND SHORT OF ASSIGNING A ONE'S PARTNER TO A TO CHECK UM FREQUENCY IN TU MESSANCE WHAT IS THE A WAY THAT MEN WOULD KNOW THAT THAT'S HAPPENING FOR YOU TUG ABOUT WAKING UP WITH IN ERECTION IS THAT A REQUISITE FOR KNOWING THAT NOCTURNAL ERECTIONS ARE OCCURRING WELL I YET I THINK YOU YET HAND A COPME I HE GOTS HA GOOD QUESTION SO I THINK A LOT OF TIMES YOU WON'T KNOW BUT I THINK IF YOU HAVE SORT OF NORMAL RESPONSE YOU KNOW WHEN EITHER BY YOURSELF WITH THA PARTNER I THINK THAT GENERALLY MEANS A THE YOU ARE GOINGTO GET NORMAL ERECTION SO I THINK I GUESS WHEN I SAY USIT OR LOSE THT IT DOESN'T MEAN ESTRALY THE MAN HAS TO STIMULATE HIMSELF OR KIND OF A MAKE SURE THAT HE DOES HAVE YOU KNOW ADEQUATE FUNCTION BECAUSE USUALLY MOST OF THAT NORMAL FUNCTION JUST OCCURS PEUKNOW WITH THISE NOCTURNAL PENOW TWO MASSONS WHICH WE ALL GET AND I THINK SOMETIMES MEN DO NOTICE WHEN THEY WAKE UP AT NIGHT SOMETIMES IN THE MORNING YOU WAKE UP WITH THEN ERECTION MEN NOTICE THAT BUT THE APSLEN OF THAT DOESN'T MEAN ITS NOT HAPPENING AT LIKELY IS JUST YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE SLEEP THROUGH IT WHICH IS NORMAL OTHERWISE MEN WOULD NEVER GET ANY SLEEP BECAUSE THE HAPPENS MANY MANY TIMES THE NIGHT A SO I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING NORMAL FUNCTION I THINK THATS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD PROBUOUSLY YOU KNOW A PHYSICIAN ABOUT AND THEN SAME FOR LIKE YERINARING FUNCTION I THINK IF IT BOTHERS YOU IF THERE'S YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE WAKING UP AT NIGHTS YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHS FROM OFF AND INTERSTREAM IS GETTING WEAKER THOSE ARE ALL SORT OF COMPLAINTS DO WE HEREABOUT WHAT IS OFTEN AM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S A NORMAL TO WAKE UP PERHAPS ONCE DURING THE NIGHT TO EURIN ATE A AND THIS IS A COURSE ASSUMING AD AGAIN FORGIVE ME FOR ALL THE CAVIATES BUT I'VE DONE THIS LONG ENOUGH THAT YOU KNOW IF I DON'T GET REALLY GRANDULAR ABOUT SOME OF THIS THAN TOAS ALLL WOULD IF I DRANK YOU KNOW THIRTY TWO OUNCES A FLUID RIGHT BEFORE SLEEP AND I'M OU'RE INATING THREE TIMES FOR NIGHT WELL WE'RE ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE ARE TAPERING THEIR LIQUID AND TAKE AS THEY APPROACH BED TIME AM AND THAT WAKING UP ONCE MAY BE TWICE BUT ONCE IN THE MILL THE NIGHT TO EUR IN ATE IS NORMAL FOR SOMEBODY LET SAY AGE I DON'T KNOW EIGHTEEN TO FORTY AND MAYBE FROM FORTY TO A HUNDRED A THAT NUMBER MIGHT BE IN THE A ONE TO TWO TIMES PER NIGHT IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT YET I MANIT THINK ONCE THE NIGHT YET I'S NORMAL FROM US MEN AND THEN I THINK YF THING SART TO BOTHER YOU AT THE ONCERTANLY SEE SOMEBODY BUT IT'S HARD TO GET BETTER THAN ONCE OR TWICE TO NIGHT AFFORMOST MEN AMY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AM NOCTURNAL ERECTION AND THE AMOUNT OF REM SLEEP RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP THAT ONE IS GETTING THAT THIS TENDE TO BE MORE FREQUENT TOWARD MORNING AS THE A PROPORTIONT OF RAPID EYED MOVEMENT SLEEP INCREASES I ON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE ENOUGHT BUT IE FOUND COUPLE OF STUDIES THAT AT LEAST POINT IN THAT DIRECTION NOT UN INTENDED A SO THAT RAISES A A BIGGER ISSUE THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET WHICH IS GETTING ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF QUALITY SLEEP EACH NIGHT AND AM I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT SEVEN TO NINE HOURS I DEALLY AM WHICH MEANS GETTING SUFFICIENT SLOWAVE DEEP SLEEP AS WELL AS RAP AND I MOVEMENT SLEEP BUT NOWADAYS A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WORKING EXCESSIVE HOURS OR UM GETTING IU NO FOUR FIVE SIX HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT IS THERE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GETTING LESS THAN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF SLEEP AND SPIRM QUALITY TO STOSTRONE LEVELS AND UM SEXUAL HEALTH THE O MEN I THINK CERTAINLY THERE'S REASONABLE DATA FOR SEEMIN QUALITY AND THERE TENDS TO BE EM NO WE CALL LIKE IN SCIENCE SORT OF A USAPE RELATIONSHIP SO THAT IT'S NOT SORT OF LENEER SOS YET MORE SLEEP THINGS ARE BETTER THERE'S SORT OF THE'S IS CONCEPT OF TOO MUCH SLEEP AND NOT ENOUGH SLEEP SO THE IDEAL I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT AT SEVENTY NINE HOURS AND FOR MEN THAT ARE NOT GETTING THAT SEEMIN QUALITANTS TO BE LOWER AND THEN FOR MEN GETTING TOO MUCH UM WE ALSO SEE AT TECLIME AND YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS AS E GET NOT CERTAIN IS BEGET I THROUG ABLE TO GET THAT MUCH SLEEP MAYBE THERE'S OTHER THINGS AS WELL THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT BUT EM SO I THINK NOT OF GETTING IN THAT IDEAL SLEEP MOUT IS BEST FOR SEEMING QUALITY AND PROBABLY FOR BROAD TOSTIC IT FUNCTION AS WELL YOU KEEP BRINGING UP SEEMING QUALITY UM IN A WAY THAT MAKES ME WONDER WHETHER OR NOT IS SEMING QUALITY OF PROXY FOR OVER ALL VITALITY AND HEALTH OR S TESTOSTRON LEVEL APROXY FOR OVER ALL VITALITY AND HEALTH AM IT SONDS LIKE SEEMING QUALITIEIS THE THE METRIC THAT YOU KEEP COMING BACK TO IN A WAY THAT UM I'VE TO A SOOM REFLECTS THE OR YOU KNOW YOUR CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN THAT THE TE MANY A PAPERS THAT YOU AUTHORED IN THIS AREA UM I THINK FOR PEOPLE THAT HERE SEEMING QUALITY AND WHO ARE NOT INTERESTING CONCEIVING CHILDREN NOW OR WHO ARE WHICH SHOF COURSE COD INCLUDE PEOPLE ARY HAD CHILDREN OR WHO DON'T WANT CHILDREN UM SEEMING QUALITY SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT RELATES TO FERTILITY BUT IS SEEMING QUALITY SOMETHING THAT IS A GOOD GOAL FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN OVER ALL MALE VITALITY AND HEALTH IS IT IS IT ONE OF THE BETTER METRICS OF OVER ALL A VITALITY ND HEALTH WHY THINK YOU IT'S I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT MARKER FOR OVER ALL HEALTH I THINK THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SUPPORT IT CAN BE MEASURE OF HOW HEALTHY YOU ARE YOU KNOW I FOU LOOK IT MEN WITH WORE HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT CAN HAVE LOWER SEAMAN QUALITY BUT ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT SEAMEN QUALITY JUST BY ITSELF AND THEN YOU LOOK INTO THE FUTURE HOW THESE MEN TEND TO DO IF THEY HAVE HIGHER SEAMAN QUALITY A THEY TEND TO LIVE LONGER ME TO GO TO THE DOCTOR LESS LOWER RATES OF CANCER SO I THINK THEREIS A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT SEMAN QUALITY MAY BE A GOOD BAROMETER OF HEALTH A YOU KNOWS YU KNOW WHY THAT LINK EXISTS I THIANK AS NOT IS NOT KNOWN BUT THERE'S LOTS OF THEORIES SO ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW PRY ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE MALGENOM IS DEVOTED A REPRODUCTION A AND SO MAKE SENSE GIVEN THEM  HAVE ABOUT YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND GENES IN THE BOTY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF A YOU KNOW OVERLAP SO ONE GENE THAT PLAYS A ROLE AND REPRODUCTION MAY PLAY A ROLE AND AN THE PARTIOF ASK FOR SYSTEM OR THE MENEROLOGICAL SYSTEM AND SO IF WE GET THE FIRST YOU KNOW SORT OF SIGN THAT REPRODUCTION IS NOT PERFECT THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER HEALTH CONSEQUENCES DOWN THE LINE A ANOTHER SORT OF HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AGAIN SORT OF GOING ALONG THIS LINE THAT REPRODUCTIONIS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE SEE IS THAT A YOU KNOW GESTATION IS SORT OF VERY CRITICAL TO ARE YOU KNOW EXISTENCE RIGHT IN PERTURBATIONS TO THAT SYSTEM HAVE PROLONGED A YOU KNOW EFFECTS SO AT THE SO CALLED SORT OF DEVELOPMENT O ORGIN OF THE DULT DISEASE ARE THE BARKER HYPOTHESIS  AND SO WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PREMATURE CHILDREN AF HIHERISK OF CARTIO ASCUTERS EAS RIVEN STUDIES TO SHOW DAT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THESE GESTATIONAL EFFECTS CAN ALSO A PLAY OUT ON REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION TOO SO THAT ALSO MAY BE KIND OF A LINK YOU A SORT OF EARLY SEEDING AF REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION AND THEN THAT MAY BE THE FIRST MARKER THAT WERE GOING TO HAVE FOR OTHER HEALTH EFFECTS LATER ONE A THERE ALSO IT'S AST SORT OF SORT OF INHERENT A FOR A SIMILARITIIS BETWEEN A REPRODUCTION IN SOME OTHER SORT OF SOCIAL EFFECTS SO YOU KNW KIND OF ONE SORT OF CONFOUNDING FACTOR WHENE WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE STUDIES IE TALKED ABOUT LOOKING IMMORTALITY FOR EXAM PLE AND SEMAN QUALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW THER SORT OF FACTORS THAT NECESSARILY INVOLVE REPRODUCTION SO YOU CHILDREN AND HAVING A PARTNER AND HAVING A PARTNER PROLONGS LIFE AM HAVING KIDS PROLONGIGE EVEN THE FILLS LIKE KIDS ARE KILLING YOU IF YOU LOOK AT STUDIES MEN WITH KIDS TEN TO LIVE LONGER AM SO YOU KOW THAT'S ANOTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATION BUT I THINK WE KNO REALLY SORT OF THIS HEALTH AM YOU KNOW LINK BETWEEN FERTILITY I THINK IT SORT OF A POWERFUL ONE SO I DO THINK IT SHOULD BE A BAROMETER I THINK THAT YOUKOW IT SHOULD BE  WEN I'VE GIVEN LECTURES ON THIS I CALL AT THE SIX BITLE LINE I THINK OF SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK BECAUSE IF THERE IS OU NOW SORT OF LOWER LEVELS THAT MAY TELL US ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN MEN COME IN FOR FRTILLY OF IWATONS A LOT OF TIME WE DO DIAGNOS YOU KNOW THESE NEW MEDICAL PROBLEMS SOMETIMES WE DIAGNO'S CANCER YOU KNOW RV ALLUDING TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS EVE ASK DIBES AND SOME OTHER OU NO VERY SIGNIFICANT GENETIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AND YOU KNOW THE FIRST WAY THAT WE WOULD IDENTIFY IT AS REPRODUCTIVE FAILURE BECAUSE THERS FIRM COUNCER LOU AM AN OTHER THING SO IT IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT IT'S CERTAOF IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK FOR PEOPLE TO REALIZE A AND IT WOULD BE GREAT I THINK YOU KNOW ANOTHER AM I THINK ADVANTAGE TO LIKE THE CENTRES FOR ZESE CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE THO TO START TRACKING IT WOULE O BE A GOOD IDEA FOR UM MALES IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES TO GET A SPERMANALSIS TIS TO HAVE A BASE LINE I CONFESS I'M FORTY SEVEN NOW AM ONE THING I WISH I AD DONE IN MY TWENTIE SO AS TO GET MY A BLOADHORMON PROFILES AND LIPID PROFILES DONE WHEN I WAS IN MY TEENS AND TWENTIES BECAUSE I'D HAVE SOMETHING TO COMPARE TO M I STARTED DOING THAT IN MY MID THIRTIES AND I'M SO GLAD I DID ECAUSE I CAN NOW COMPARE TO MY MID THIRTY SLEVELS I STARTD INCLUDING UM SPERMANALYSIS A BOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO UM WITH THE INTENTION OF FREEZING SPERMAN  DID THAT UM BECAUSE I WAS ALSO READING AT THAT TIME ABOUT THE INCREASED RISK OF AUTISM AM IN OFFSPRING OF MALES OLDER THAN OARTY SOMETHING HAT I REALLY WOULD LIKE YOUR TAKE ON BUT AM IT SEEMS LIKE GETS INEXPENSIVE ENOUGH TO DO A SPERMANALSIS A I THINK NOW THEY PEOPLE CAN GET A DONE AT HOME THEY HAVE MAL MAIL KETS AL THOUGH I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE MOTILITY COULD BE MAINTAINED IF YOUR MAILING YOUR SPERM BACK AM AT ROOM TEMPERATURE OR YOUO TETTING THRUGH THE POST OFFICE NOW OF ROOMS IMAGING ALL THESE SPERM TRAVELLING THROUGH THE THE POSTAL SERVICE IT'S OUT THEI'RE OUT THERE FOLKS AM YET WHAT WHAT RE YOUR THOUGHT SHOULD AM SHOULD PEOPLE INVEST THE I THINK IS A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET A A SPERMANALSIS MORE A COSTLY TO GET THE DEANNA FRAGMENTATION THAN YOU GET UP INTO THE LOW THOUSANDS AM BUT IF PEOPLE HAVE THE DISPOSABLE INCOME IS A GOOD IDEA FOR THEM TO DO I MAY I THINK IT'S A WORTH WHILE TESTS I THINK MORE INFORMATION AS ALWAYS GOOD AM YOU KNOW I THINK SORT OF ONE OF THE SAME REASONS THAT AM YOU KNOW YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT CHECKING LIKE LIPPID LEVELS OR WE TELL YOU KNOW MEN AND WOMEN TO GET BLOODPRESSURE CHECKED I THINK YOU NOW GETTING THAT SORT OF EARLY HEALTH INDICATOR I THINK CAN BE IMPORTANT I THINK YOU KNO GOING BACK TO NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHY SEAMAN QUAITY IS TELLING US ABOUT HEALTH WHAT THE EXACT LINK MAY BE YOU KNOW MEANS THAT IF SOMEBODY IS COMING IN WITH A LOW SPIRM COUNT ER ICLY THE ABSENCE FIRM COUNT IT'S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO COUNSIL THAT THAT PERSON OTHER THAN THAT MAY BE REPRODUCTIVE DIFFICULTIES M BUT I THINK JUST TA SORT OF A MARKER FOR REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL I THINK IT'S USEFUL AND ALIKE YOU SAD I THINK IT'S BECOME A LOT EASIER ONE OF THE FORINNOVATIONS IN THE SPACE AM AND YOU KNOW SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW IS IN THE REPRODUCT THE WORLD I THINK IT'S JUST REALLY GREAT TO SEE FOR THIS INFLUX AND CAPITAL A NEW COMPANYIS COMING IN THE TRYING TO JUST DECREASE THE BARRIER TO YOU GETTING A SEEMENT AS THE USED TO BE APT TO GO TO A LAB SCHETUL ANT APPOINTMENT SOMETIMES THEY WOLD SEND YOU TO A BATH ROOM WHICH CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE YOUS PEOPLE DE YOU KNOW YOU KOW PEOPLE DO IN A BATHROOM JUST NEXT DE OR YOU TRYING TO COLLECT BUT THEY WOULD SEND THEM INTO IN A COMMON SPACE MA HOMENER BAYS BOUT THEY WON'T EVEN GIVE THEM THE QUIET ROOM WITH THE WITH THE RED LIGHT WHICH IS A RIGHT WHAT I HEAR THEY DO NOW THE SOME OF EM TO HAVE ITIA SO THERE ARE SOME HIGHER LEVEL OH I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN WAVIDIOS I JUST AT I THINK THAT A O KET YES I'VE DONE THIS ALL JUST AT I MEAN I'VE BEN TRYING TO NORMALIZE THINGS RELATED TO ALL ASPECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH IS NEW WEALTH UM SO UM YE I I DECIDE TO FREES PERMAND BASELY THEY SENT ME TO A ROOM THAT I WENT TO A UNIVERSITY BASET ACTUALLY WASN'T STAMFOR BUT DIFEREN UNIVERSY AND UM I YE THEY PUT THE CUP THROUGH THE WINDOW THEY GIVE YOU THE CUP THEY UM THEY CLOSE THE DOOR AND THEY TELL YOU THAT AS LONG AS THAT RED LIGHT IS ON OVER THE DOOR NO ONES CAN WALK IN AND THEN THEY LEAVE AND I THINK THEY THE ASSUMPTION NOW IS THAT A YOU FIGURE IT OUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER UM HOW TO PROVIDE THE SAMPLE ANDTHE PUT THE SAMPLE BACK THROUGH THE THE THING AND THEN ONE THING THES CLINECTS REALLY NEED TO WORK OUT IS THAT ANY TIME YOU'RE WALKING OUT YET YOU SEE THE PEOPLE PROCESS IN YOUR SAMPLESS YOU WALK OUT SO THERE 'S ALL THIS UM THIS A FEIGNING OF OF A YOU KNOW ANANIMITY BUT REALLY IT ISN'T THERE YOU KNOW I AS THEY LIKE SEE LATER YOU GREAT YOUNT YOU KNOW THAT THEY RARELY ASK YOU QUESTIONS ON THE WAY OUT BUT IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE PROCESS OVER ALL AND UAND I MUST SAY THAT THAT THE DATA ARE INFORMATIVE YOU GET THEY YOU KNOW GET THE VOLUME NUMBER MOTILE FORWARD INLY MOTILE I DID OPT FOR THE DEINNA FRAGMENTATION UM DATA UM AND I JUST LOVE DATA SO I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BUT AGAIN UM  MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO FLAG THIS WHAT THIS SET OF FINDINGS I BELIEVE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A SMALL BUT SISI SIGLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ARTISTIC BIRTHS DUE TO A PREGNANCIES WHERE THE MALE WAS OVER FORTY AT THE TIME OF UM OF A CONCEPTION UM SO I FIGURED YOU KNOW WHY NOT FREE SOME SPERMIN ITS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE YES SO I THINK PATERNAL AGES ALSO YOU KNOW SOMETHING BUT'S INCREASING IN THIS COUNTRY SO OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS OR SO WE'VE SEEIN THAT THE AVERAGE PATERNAL AGEIS INCREASE FROM ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN AND A HALF TO ABOUT THIRTY ONE UM AND I SHOULD SAY THIS IS ALL FATHERS SO A BIR CERTIFICATE DATE OUR BIRTHDATA IS COLLECTED A MATERNAL LEVEL SO YOU KNOW WHEN A CHILD IS BORN SOMEBODY COMES IN TO COLLECT DATA ON THE BIRTH SO THEY ASKING ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOTHER AND THEY ALSO ASK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FATHER YOU KNOW AGE EDUCATION IVAUS E REGION I THE COUNTRY THE CHILD WAS BORN  SO WE DON'T KNOW WE KNOW WHAT NUMBER CHILD THAT WAS FOR THE FATHER WE NON'T FOR THE MOTHER THEY DO ASKING I WAS OUR FIRST SECOND THIRD ET CETER A CHILD M SO THE FATHER AND FORTUNE WE JUST HAVE DATA THE SORT OF ALL LUMP TOGETHER  BUT OVER THE LAST AGAIN FORTY YEARS WE'VE SEEN THAT INCREASE INTRUSTING OVERTHE LAST FORTY YEARS THE YOUNGEST FATHER WAS ELEVEN AND THE OLDE IS EIGHTY EIGHT ELEVEN QUITE A SPANYAW EIGHTY EIGHT GOODNESS UNRELATED I WATER NI NIAS DO GOODNEIT'S ANOTOMIZ DATA BUT I LEVEN A I HAVE TO ASK THE SORRY TO A TAKE US ON A SLIGHT TANSION BUT WHAT IS THE AVERAGE AGE OF PUBERTY IN MALES IN THE UNITED STATES A NOW YES SO YOU ASKING BAGUTS FORT A PERMARKY WHEN LIKE SPERN PRODUCTION BEGINS SO ANOTHERE AR LOT OF MARKERS OF A PUBERTY THE OLICANDAVERY SEXUAL CHARACTERIS O BEARD GROW DEEPENING A VOICEITS HERER THEY HAPPEN AT DIFFERENT RATES IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT YE THANK YOU AM AT WHAT POINT A ARE A YOUNG MALES UNDERGOING UBERTY A T THE LEVEL OF O THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE YES SO IT'S YET THERE HAS BEEN DATA THAT WERE GOING THROUGH PUBERTY A LITTLE BUT EARLIER NOW THAN WE USED TO I BUT IT REALLY DERYS SO WE DON I THINK IT'S NOT AM YOU KNOW JUST LIKE TESTOSTRAAN RANGES BETWEEN LIKE THREE HUNDRED A NIGHT HUNDRIT'S A WIDE RANGE FOR ANYBODY I THINK FOR MOST YINDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW PUBERTY IS YOU KNOW PROBBLY TWELVE TO KIND OF FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IN GENERAL SO I'VE JUST GIVE SORT OF A VERY WIDE RANGE WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SAY THAT'S O CAYAN YOU KNOW SOME OF THE DAY DOT BASING IT ON IS A WHEN SPERN PRODUCTION BEGINS IN BOYS AND IT'S ACTUALLY YOU KNOW NOT THATS SIMPLE TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT BECAUSE HE KNOW WE DON'T GENERALLY TALK TO YOU KNOW YOUNG BOYS ABOUT HOW TO MASTER Y HAD TO COLLECT IND THEN CHECK ON THAT BUT THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED FIRST MORNING BOIDED URONE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES TON AND THEY SEE IF THERE ARE SORT OF IN O NOCTURNAL OMISSIONS WHETHER THER SPERM IN THERE AND SO GENERALLY A PROBALY STARGE AROUND AM THE EARLIEST O BE KIND OF ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN BUT USUALLY MOST IS PROBABLY LITTLE LATER SO MAY BE ALL REFINE THAT PUBERTY AND MOVE IT A LITTLE BUT LATER BY FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN  IS WHEN PROBLY ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHTY PER CENT OF BOYS ARE GOING TO HAVE PRODUCED STARTED PRODUCING SPERM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN FEMALES PUBERTY IS ALSO SHIFTING EARLIER PERHAPS AT A MORE DRAMATIC RATE THAN APPEARS TO BE THE CASE FOR MALES WELL I THINK THERE IS SOME DATA FOR MALES TOO I THINK A BUT I GET FROUR LISTENERS ON A WANT A YOU KNOW HAVE THIS ONSLAUGHT OF YOU KNOW PEDIATRICIAN SEEING KIDS THAT HAVENT PENO WHEN BOYS HAVENT GONE THROUGH PUBRITY BY A CERTAINTY SO I THINK IT STILL FAIRLY WIDE LET'S GET BACK TO AGE OF THE FATHER AND ISSUES LIKE AUTISM A WHAT ARE THE DATA THERE AM AN THIS TO ME IS A PRACTICAL ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK IF THERE'S ONE OBVIOUS TAKE AWAY FROM OUR DISCUSSION TO DAY IT'S THAT A MALES SHOULD PROBABLY NOT WAIT UNTIL THEYRE TRYING TO CONCEIVE IN ORDER TO ASSESS THER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AT THE LEVEL SPERM QUALITY A TISTOSTERON LEVELS PERHAPS BUT AT LEAST SPERM QUALITY BUT AM BUT PERHAPS MEN SHOULD LSO BE FREEZING THEIR SPERM IF IN FACT CONCEIVING CHILDREN AFTER FORTY PLACES THEIR CHILDREN AT FAR GREATER RESRAUTISM AND MINER STANDING IS THAT THE RATES OF AUTISM OR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND EIGHTY YOU'LL HEAR AS HIGH AS ONE IN FIFTY MALE BERST BUT I THINK IT'S PROULY MORE LIKE ONE IN SIXTY TO EIGHTY IS THAT A RIGHT M AND THAT THE AGE OF THE FATHER IS A RISTCRACTOR YET I THINK THAT THIS GUESTS IN SORT OF THE LARGER ISSUE A YOU KNOW HOW MEN SORE A PRECEIVED FERTILITY SO YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT AS WOMEN ATES FOR TILLI ECLINES BUT THE OLDEST FATHER EVERS NINETY SI SO THE BIOLOGIC POTENTIAL CERTAINLY PERSISTS IT I WONT TO KNOW HOW LONG HE LIVED TO SEE HOW HIS CHILD GROW UP  W HE CONCEIVED AT NINETY SIX SUMPOSEDLY SUPPOSEDLY A WE I MIS SEING HE DID NOT MEAN HIS GRANDCHILDREN AT LEAST NOT THE YOR GRANDCHILD OF THAT CHILD SO WELL HOW LONG DID HE LIVE IM YOU KNOW I WELL SO THAT THIS IS WAS A MAN IN INDIA IT'S AS HREAD UP A FAMOUS STORY BUT SUPPOSEDLY IM HE HAD A CHILD HE HAVE THAT CHILD WITH HIM ON A LIKE THEIR WAITINGIN A BUSTOP HE FELL ASLEEP TA CHILD WAS KIDDEN OUT  LET TE DEVORE SO OH E DREADFUL SORT OF AA HORRIBLE END BUT THE WIFE WAS ALSO OR NOT NOT BATTLD BUT IN HER FIFTIES MCASO YE WELL AM TRAGIC AN AN INCREDIBLE STORY FOR SEPARATE REASONS EM FOQUET I'LL GET MY HEAD AROUND THIS NINETY SIX YEAR OLD A A CONCEIVING A CHILD A C A PLEASE CONTINUE YESO PEOPLE I THINK HER MEN THINK THAT THE SORT OF THA M YOU KNOW THERE YOU KNOW FRFERTILE ROAD IS SORT OF INFINITE BUT I THINK THAT'S VERY MUCH NOT THE CASE SOS YOU'RE ALLUDING TO PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED INTO RISKS FOR OLDER FATHER SO YOU KNW ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AS FIRST NOTICE THAT DWARFISM OR CONTROPLESIO WAS MORE COMMON AND LAST BORN CHILDREN SO VENTUALLY THAT LINK WAS MADE EM AND SINCE THEN OTHER CONDITIONS TOO  SO THERE LIKE THESE NEAROUS PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS ARE TALKING ABOUT LIKE ATISM AS CERTAINLY ONE BY POLER SKITSIPHRANIA PEOPLE OF LOOKED AT ALSO LINKED THAT WITH OLDER AGE YOU KNOW LESS ATTAINMENT IN SCHOOL YOU KNOW FAILING GRADS ALL THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A LITTLE BUT MORE COMMON WITH OLDER FATHERS SO YOU KNOW WHY I THINK ALL THESE EXISTS YUTHERE CAN BE SORT OF DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS EM YOU KNOW ONE EXPLANATION FOR THE AUTISM ASSOCIATION I'LL TALK ABOUT EM YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS MORE GENETIC OR IM CIMUTATIONAL REASONS ABOUT ONE THING THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW COULD BE SORT OF A HEREDITARY TRAIT AND SO IT MAY BE THAT YOU KNOW MEN THAT DISPLAYS SOME SORT OF ARTISTIC CHARACTERISTIC SEEN A MAYBE THEY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO MEET A PARDNER AND SO IT SORT OF DELAY CHILD RANG SO MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION BUT I THINK OU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THERE CAN BE NO REAL EPOGENETIC CHANGES THAT OCCUR WITH AGE AMUTATIONAL CHANGES THAT OCCUR WITH AGE EM I THINK I READ ACITISTIC AND YOU WOULD KNOW MORE BEING UNDER A SCIENTIS THAT EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE THE GENES IN OUR BODY EXPRESS SOMEWHERE IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THAID ME MUCH ABOUT RIGHT YE I OT I D WANT TO STAMP MY NAME TO THAT A UM BUT THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT SO EM ITS ITS ESTIMATED THAT EVERY YEAR WE ITGENERATE ABOUT TWO MUTATIONS AND ARE U OU KNOWS FIRM DIANE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU KNOW OF FORTY YEAR ALL THIT'S GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW TWENTY YEAR IDRI FORTY MORE MUTATIONS IM THEN A TWENTY EAROLL SO THAT RATE DOES GO UP AND IF YOUR DISRANDOM LESE SPRINKLING MUTATIONS YOU KNOW IN YOU KNOW A GENOM THAT THEY'RE MORE LIKELY THAT SORT OF MANIFEST AND YOU KNOW MAY BE NEAR A PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS EM SO THERE ARE YOU KNO DATE A COVITZING DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THAT DOES OCCUR NOW AGAIN THRE'S BMILLIONS OF BASE PARS IN THE BODY SO THESE RAN IMUTATIONS LIKELY MOST OF TEM WILL NOT RESULT IN ANYTHING BUT THERE CAN'T BE SOME MEANEEFUL AND SO FOR EXAMPLE A COUNTROPLASIS DUE TO AMUTATION IN FIBRE BLAST TO GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR EM AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THIS CONDITION IS NOT THAT RARE RIHTE BASED ON SORT OF THESE RARE MUTATIONS YOU'D EXPECT THIS WOULD YOU KNOW O CUR MAY BE ABOUT ONE AND A HUNDRED MILLION BUT IT TURNS OUT THESE THESE CONDITIONS OCCUR IN ABOUT ONE AND THINK THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND OR SO SO THERE SORT OF DISCREPANCY BASED ON FOR MUTATIONAL RATE THAT WE EXPECT BASED ON AGE AND THE RATE THAT WE ACTUALLY SEE SO THE EXPLANATION FOR THIS IS SOMETHING CALLED SELFISH PRAMATIGONIAL SELECTION SO WHAT THIS SUGGESTS IS THAT SOME OF THESE MUTATIONS THAT OCCURRANOMLY OCCUR IN PROLIFER RATIEN PATHWAYS AND SO IT GIVES THE SPIRM THAT CONTAIN THESE SORT OF ADVANTAGES OVER THERE YOU KNOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT DON'T HAVE THEM FOR EXAMPLE AND SO THEN THEY OUT COMPETE THE OTHERE SPIRM AND SO THE'RE MORE LIKELY TO LEAD TO A CHILD RATHER HIN SORT OF A RANDOM SMATTERING YOU CAN ACT YOU SEE THAT SOME OF THESE MUTATIONS ARE MORE COMMON AND OLDER MEN THAN YOUNGER MEN IF YOU LOOK RESCREEND FOR SOME OF THESE MUTATIONS IN YOU KNOW SOMEBOF THESE PATHWAYS EM AGAIN THE LONGER THAT WERE EXPOSED TO LIFE THERE'S US MORE LIKELY TO BE  O DIFFERENT CHEMICAL EXPOSURES OTHER EXPOSURES AND SO PEOPLE AVE LOOKED AT EPIGENETIC SIGNATURES SORT OF THESE SIGNATURES THAT EM YOU KNOW THE DICTATE WHICH GENES ARE GOIN TO BE EXPRESSD AN WHICH AREN'T AND THERE R DIFFERENT PATTERNS BETWEEN OLDER AND YOUNGER FATHERS AND YOU KNOW WHY WHAT TRIGGERING THOSE IS NOT KNOWN BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES SO THOSE COULD ALSO POTENTIALLY EXPLAIN YOU KNOW SOMEBO THES RISK THAT WE SEE EM YU KNON'T USED TO BE THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE N OLDER FATHER MAYBE THERE IS A LOT OF ADVANTAGES YOU KNOW FOR THE KIDS RITKIS SUFURE YOU'RE MORE RESOURCE IT I ALWAYS TELL PATIENTS T YOU KNOW WHEN THEY COME TO SEE ME FOR RY CORRECTION PROBEMS OR ANYTHING I ALWAYS SAY NOTHING GETS BETTER WITH AGE RIGHT AN THAT'S MOSTLY TRURE ALTHOUGH THEY POINTED OUT THAT EM SALARY OFTEN GOES UP WITH AGE AND WISDOM GOES UP WITH AGE SO YOU'LD IMAGINE IF YOU'RE MORE RESOURCE MAYBE THE KIDSRGANA ALSO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE TO THAT BUT YOU KOW AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF CONVINCING DATA THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE CASE EM THERE'S YEVEN THERE'S ONE STUDY THAT I SAW THAT SHOWED THAT IF YOU LOOK AT EM OUR EYES E BRAINS OF CHILDREN JUST AFTER BIRTH THER ACTUAL A LITTLE SMALLER FOR OLDER FATHERS COMPARED TO YOUNGER FATHERS SO EM I THINK THERE ARE SOME YOU KNOW SORT OF TALKING ABOUT  OF NEURO CONAT OF DEVELOPMENT EM SOME OF THOSE E FACTS AN THRE'S ALSO BEEN EM STUDIES LOOKING AT CANCER RISK TOO SO HIRISK OF BREST CANCS ER PROSSTEY CANCER IN ADULL CHILDREN PIRISK OF YOU KNOW LUCIMIA OR SEEANESS CANCERS AN CHILDREN AS WELL SO I THINK THE MORE WE LOOK THE MORE WE FIND OUT OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS WITH PATERNAL AGE EM SO I THINK IT' SOME ME CERTAIN LY BE AWARE I THINK HE TALKING ABOUT MITIGATION STRATEGIES I THINK FOR EDUCATION BE IMPORTANT FOR YOU COUPLES TO TRY IT EARLIER YOU INDIVIDUALS TO TRY EARLI ER TO CONCEIVE YOU KNOW IF WE THINK IT SIMUTATIONAL REASON I THINK EM YOU KNOW CERTAINLY FREEZING SPERM I THINK IS  IS A GODOCTION AS WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AM ANALYSIS OF DIONE FRAGMENTATION IN SPRM DE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR SELECTION AF THE BEST SPERM ON THE BASIS OF A DIONE COMPOSITION AM TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH WHAT I MEAN IS IN ORDER TO TELL WHETHER OR NOT THE THE DIONA OR MUTAT IN A SPERM YOU HAVE TO KILL THE SPERM BASICALLY SO AM ENSINCE AM IN A GIVEN POOL OF SPERM SO TO SPEAK AM THERE WILL BE FORWARD MOTILE NONMOTILE TWITCHERS TWITCHING IN PLACE DEAD SPERM AM SOME PERCENTAGEO DEAD SPERMER IN MOTILE SPERMS PRESUMABLY NO NORMAL SOME SMALL PERCENTAGE  HOPEFULLY AM AND THAT SOME MIGHT HAVE SOME DIONE FRAGMENTATION SOME MIGHT NOT SO A IS THE WAY TO ADDRESS THIS AM AVERAGES IT WHAT I'M HEARING HERE IS THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY HAD KIDS OR IF YOU WANT MORE KIDS AM THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR SPERM QUALITY I WOULD SAYL YOU DO AM AND THAT IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK A D'ONEE FRAGMENTATION DATA AM BUT HAVING DONE THIS AM WHAT ONE RECEIVES IS A CHART THAT GOES FROM RED BAD TO GREEN GOOD AND THEN THEY PUT THE ARROW HOOTFULLY IN THE GREEN ZONE AND THEN YOU SAY OH GOOD YOU KNOW I'M IN THE GREENZONE I DON'T HAVE FRAGMENTE DIONAE IN MY SPERM BUT REALLY THAT'S AN AVERAGING OF ALL THE SPURN RIGHT RIGHT IT COULD BE THAT AS YOU AGE THAT SOME PERCENTAGE OF THE SPERM HAVE FRAGMENTED D'ONEE AND AM IF ONE OF THOSE IS THE ONE THAT SUCCESSFULLY AM WINS THE EGG SO TO SPEAK A FERTILIZES THE EGG THEN THAT FRAGMENTED D'ONEE CONTAINING SPERM IS GOING TO PROPAGATE THAT IN TO YOUR OFFSPRING SO ARE THERE AN Y TECNOLOGIES THAT CAN ALLOW MEN TO AM SELECT OR  FOR OR IMPROFE THE D'ONAE OF THERSPURN NOT JUST THE MOTILITY I YEI WICH RIGHT THAT SORT OF THE HOLY GRAIL BECAUSE I THINK HE POINTED OUT SORT OF A VARYING OF RIGHT THE HISENBURG AND CERTAINY PRINCIPLES THAT WE CAN'T IF WE IDENTIFY WHICH SPIRM IS BAD WE'RE NECERLY GAN A DESTROY IT SO TO TELL YOU KNOW WHICH ONE IS HARBOURING THESE MUTATIONS A WOULD BE GREAT BUT I THINK WE'RE NOT THERE YET I MEAN ONE THING THAT WE DO DO IS WASHSPERM SO WE DO SORT OF SELECT THE MOST MOTAL SPERM WE CLEAR OUT THE DEAD ONES A AND I THINK EMERY ALL DOES R PRETTY GOOD AT TELLING WHICH FIRM THY THINK OR BETTER BUT YEND AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE ANY REAL OBJECTIVE DATA TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND YOU KOW WHICH OR HARBOURING SOMETHING OR OTHER BUT I THINK IF WE UNDERSTOOD MORE ABOUT THIS LINK WITH AGE OR AGAIN OTHER CONDITIONS A HOPEFULLY ROUD VEAL  A STOP SOME OF THIS PASS THROUGH LET'S GET BACK TO THE PROSTATE A TIS INCREDIBLE GLAND TELL TELL US ABOUT THE PROSATE I THINK WE HEAR ABOUT THE PROSTAE WE HEREABOUT PROSATE CANT SIR AM PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE HEARD THAT IT'S INVOLVED IN THE EJACULATORY RESPONSE IT'S VOLVEN IRECTIONS IT'S INVOLVED A NUMBER OF THINGS YOU GIVE US A YOU KNOW I CATALOGUE OF THINGS THAT THE PROSTATE DOES A AVE YOU SPENT LOW TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS GLAND WHAT IS OMON THE COOLER THINGS THAT IT THAT I IT DOES THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT A YOU KNOW HOW DO WE KEEP IT HEALTHY A AND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT KEEPING IT HEALTHY YES OR THE PROSTATE IS A GLAND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A WALNUT IT SITS BEHIND THE BLADDER AND I'S INVOLVED IN REPRODUCTION IT PRODUCES SOME OF THE PROTENES ANDS IMES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR YOU KNOW SPIRM TO BE SUPPORTED IN YE EJACULATE TO KIND OF KEEP THE THE SPIRM HEALTHY  IN THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT SO YOU KNOW IT FUNCTIONS IN REPRODUCTION AND THAN BASE THIC WAY AFTER REPRODUCTION IS DONE IT DOESN'T REALLY SERVE ANY USEFUL FUNCTION SO THEN IT JUST BECOMES A PROBLEM ESSENTIALLY SO TEOU RETHRA WHICH IS WHERE WEPEET THROUGH SO IT CONNECTS THE BLATTER ENA TO EXCETS THE BODY A RUNS RIGHT THROUGH THE PROSTATE AND AS WE AIDS THE PROSTATE DOES GET BIGGER THAT SORT OF A KNOWN THING AND IS THE PROSTATE GETS BIGGER IT CREATES SORT OF MORE RESISTANCE IN THIS PIPE AND SO IT MAKES THE BLATTER AFT TO WORK HARDER AND THAT LEADS TO A LOT OF THE SYMPTOMS YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALREADY HE NA WAKING UP AT NIGHT WE EXTREME THIS NEETER A OURNADE URGENTLY A SOMETIMES FEELING LIKE YOU'R NOT HEMPTING ALL THE WAY SO IT'S SORT OF A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PROSTRATE A R BEING THERE IN TERMS OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN KEEP THE PROSATE HEALTHY I THINK THAT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THAT YOU KNOW NECESSARILY YOU CAN DO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW ONE THING I'E TALK THO PACES ABOUT ONE THESE SORT OF SYMPTOMS START IS TO KNOW SOME OF THE TRIGGERS SO I MEE KN LIKE YOU MENTION DRINKING A LOT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP AT NIGHT THAT'S NOT A GOOD PRACTICE SEE IM EVEN ANTA GOING TO BED TOU LITTLE DEHYDRATED JUST SO YOU CAN TRY TO LAST THE NIGHT A THERE ARE SOME YOU KNOW PARTICULAR DRINKS OR FOODS ATTEND TO BE MORE IRRITATING SO LIKE SPICY FOODS A CITIC FOODS THOSE CON SOMPTIMES YOIRRITATE THE LINING OF THE BLATTER AND MAKE YET TO PEA A LITTLE BUT MORE YOU KOW CAFFINE IS A DIRATIC A SO IT MAKES US EURANATE MORE AND ALSO AM I CAN ALSO IRRITATE THE BLATTER AND GIVEYOU THAT SENSATION HALCOHOLE WILL DO THE SAME THING SO I THINK YOU KNOW KIND OF KNOWING SOME OF THOSE TRIGGERS MAK CONTO STAVE OFF SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS LITTL OF IT BUT YOU KNOW GET IF YOU ENJOY THOSE VICES AND YOU 'RE WILLING TO TOLERATE IF THAT'S OCCATE TO I'M HEARING MORE AN MORE ABOUT A PRACTICE OF TWEOPLE TAKING LODOS TO DALIFILL SIALIS A LODOS MEANING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF TWO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MILIGRAMS PER DAY A NOT NECESSARILY FOR ERECTILE TIS FUNCTION BUT FOR PROSTRATE HEALTH AND WAS AM SOMEWHAT SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THOSE DRUGSWHOARE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED FIRST FOR TREATMENT OF PROSTRATE HEALTH TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE PROSTRATE AM IS THAT TRUE AND AM IS THERE GOOD REASON TO A THINK ABOUT TAKING TWO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MILIGRAMS OF TODALIFILL PER DAY SIMPLY FOR MAINTAINING BLOOD FLOW TO THE PROSTRATE AND THEREBY MAINTAINING OUR IMPROVING PROSTRATE HEALTH I MEAN CERTAINLY CAN DO THAT IT CAN DEAFTLY HEALP WITH SOME OF THESE JURNARY SYMPTOMS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW LOOKING ET POSIBO CONTROL TRIAL SORT OF OUR HI ELSE ALLE OF EVIDENCE DOES SHOW THAT YOU KNOW LODUS OF TO DAL FILL IS TWO AND A HALF THE FIVE MILIGRAM THESE DAILY DOSING UM CAN HELP WITH ESURINARY SYMPTOMS SO I THINK THAT NOT MISTERELINGS OF PREVENTATIVE MEASURE BUT FOR MEN THAT ARE BOTHERED YOU KNOW OTHERWISE I THINK MUST MEN PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE A PILL EVERY DAY BUT CERTAINLY YOU HAVE SOME OF THSE SYMPSOMS AT CANDEFINITLY HELP WITH THE ORDINARY BOTHER AND THEN THE ATTED BENEFIT IS OU ALSO ALLUDED TO IS A CAN HEP WITH E RECTILE FUNCTIONS WELL EVEN AT THE TWO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MILIGRAM DOS INTERESTING UM YEHAV MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT THEREARE LOT OF PEOPLEWHOW LOVE TO TAKE PILLS EVERY DAY U THERE SEEMS TO BE A KIND OF VINARY DISTRIBUTION WHERE UM AND HERE I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE MALE I HEAR FROM BECAUSE I HEAR FROM COURSE MALES IN FEMALES BUT U I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT CAN I TAKE WHAT CAN I TAKE WHAT CAN I TAKE UM AND BUT AS YOU POINT OUT THERE'S ALSO CATEGORY OF OF MEN WHO SEEM TO UM NOT WANT TAKE ANYTHING NOT WANTED MEASURE ANYTHING NOT WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING BUT A SPECILLY NOT TAKE ANYTHING AND THEN THERE'S THE OTHER GROUP UM AND THE OTHER GROUP SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY SEEM TO BE THE LUNK THE YOUNGER EXCUSE ME POPULATION UM MAYBE GREW UP IN THE UTUBE ER UP OR THAYBE IN THE ERE AWHERE SEXUAL HEALTH WAS DISCUSSED MORE OPENLY  THAN IT WAS CERTAINLY WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I MEAN THE EXTENT OF SEXUAL HEALTH DISCUSSIONS AT MY HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO VERY GOOD HIGH SCHOOL WERE UM IT ONLY TAKES ONE SPERM WHICH DOES YOU POINT OUT TRUE FOR EVY F BUT MORE S BETTER IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCEEME NATURALLY UM AND UM THERE WERE DISCUSIONS ABOUT COMMUNICATION AND CONSENT OBVIOUSLY SUPERIMPORTANT UM AND THEN UM THEY JUST CON TURN TO S LOOSE U TO LEARN FROM OUR FRIENDS AND OTHER SOURCES I MEAN THAT AND FAMILY SOMETIMES HAD THE DISCUSSIONS SOMETIMES DIDN'T UM A DIFFEREN FAMILIES DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS OBVIOUSLY UM SO VERY VERY LITTLE IN FORMATION NOWADAYS I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SO THE TWENTY TO FORTY YEAR OLD MALE CROD SEEMS TO BE THE CROWD THETTER ASKING YET WHAT CAN I TAKE THESE AR ALSO PEOPLE WERE GETTING ON TO S OSTERON THERAPE EARLY PERHAPS WITHOUT THE NEED I JUST WONE A FLAG THAT BECAUSE AM  I THINK A I UNDERSTAND QUICKLY AM YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF TESTOSTRAN THERAPE THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE DON'T NEED IS THAT RIGHT WELL I THINK IT'S MEX SOME PEOPLE PROBABLY DO NEED IT BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW BEFORE STARTING IT EVERYBODYS TO BE AWARE OF ALL THE RESTS AND YOU'VE GON A HIGH LIGHTED SOME BUT TESTOSTER ON ANY ANY MEDICATION RIGHT IS GOING TO HAVE SOME REST SINCE EVERYBODY NEDS TO BE AWARE OF WHAT THES ARE AND PROTEST OSTROM REPRODUCTION IS CERTAINLY ONE AND IF THEY'RE NOT ALREADY DOING ALL THE OTHER THINGS GETTING ADEQUATES SLEEVE LIMITING THEIR ALCOL AND TAKES NOT SMOKE IND GETTING EXERCISE AT CETERA SEEMS THAT TOSTOSTRON THERAPY WOULD NOT BE THE PRIMARY ENTRY POINT LIKE FIRST WORK OUT ALL THE RIGHT ALL THE BASICS I THINK THAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE TETTING NOWADAYS THAT WHAT SHOULD I TAKE QUESTION COMES UP EARLY WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T NESERELY DOING ALL THE OTHER THINGS UM THAT THEY COULD DO TO PROMOTE THEIR HEALTH ANYWAY THIS IS OBSERVATION L ON MY PART AM YOU'RE THE ONE AWHOSE CLINIC THEYARE SHOWING UP I TO AM OF QUESTION ABOUT U T EYES UM WE HEAR ABOUT UTIAZ YOUR INARTRACT INFECTIONS AM IN WOMEN PRETTY OFTEN AM DO MEN GET OU T EYES IF THEY'RE GETTING MORE THAN ONE UT IE PER YEAR IS THAT ABNORMAL AM SHOULD A MEN BE A EXAMINED FOR AM THIS BLATTER OU RETHRA PROSTATE PINAL ARCHITECTURE I KNOW THEIR WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN COME IN I WAS READING ABOUT THIS PRIOR TO THIS EPISODE AT AM CAN INJUST A DIE AND THEN THEY CAN DIE IMAGE THE WHOLE APPARATUS IS THAT RIGHT L OUT HAVING TO CUT ANYTHING IS VERY  IS THAT WORTH PEOPLE DOING OR S THAT ONLY UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING SOME SOME AM SOME VEXING ISSUE YET I THINK THAT SOME OF THOSE TESTOUD ONLY BE DONE IF THERE'S A PROBLEM BUT I THINK A MAL YOU'RE INARYTRACT INFECTION IS RARE ENOUGH THAT IT SHOULD BE EVALUATED SO WOMEN HAVE VERY SHORTY RETRESS BUT MEN HAVE A VERY LONGRY THREAD IT HASK TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PINA TO REATHROUGHO THE PROSTA I CA REATER UP INTO THE BLATDER AND SO THE WAY YOU'R NITRACT INVECTION WHAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW ONE WAY WOULD BE THAT OF BLACK CURIACTUALLY GETS ALL THE WAY WE KNO BACK AND THAT'S JUST OW MUCH LONGER TRECK UM AND SO IF SOMETHING WRARE LIKE THAT DOES HAPPEN WE LOOK FOR ANTATOMIC CAUSES FOR THAT SO THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT SCARCH ISSUE IN THE EREATHOR FOR EXAMPLE THERE CAN BE STONES IN THE BLADDER THERE CAN BE STONES IN THE KIDNEY SOMETIMES MEN ARE EMPTYING THEIR BLADDERS ALL THE WAY SO THOSE THOSE MEN SHOULD BE AVALUATED BECAUSE THERE CAN BE SOME BITHOLOGY THAT WE CAN HOPE WE IDENTIFYING CORRECT LET'S TALK ABOUT ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION UM I PUT OUT THE CALL FOR QUESTIONS AND ANTICIPATION OF THIS EPISODE AND UM NO SURPRISE UM AT LEAST THIRTY PER CENT OF THE QUESTIONS FROM MALES WERE ABOUT ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION UM OR A QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S NORMAL IN TERMS OF LABIDO LEVEL OV INTERESTING RIGHT YOU KNOW AND WE'LL DEAL WITH THE FIRST QUESTION FIRST BUT UM WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF RECTILE DIS FUNCTION ARE THEY HORNMONAL IN NATURE I THINK THAT'S A COMMON BELIEF THAT IF PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING ERECTILE DIS FUNCTION THAT IT'S BECAUSE THEIR TUSTOSTRO LEVELS ARE TOO LOW HENCE ALL THE INTERESTIN UM TESTOSTROAN THERAPY UM OR ARE THERE OTHER SAY BLOOD FLOW RELATED PELVIC FLOW RELATED NURL UM BRAIN TO UM TO BODY NURL CONNECTIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE ON GUESSING IT'S ALL OF THESE THINGS  HOW DO WE PARCH THIS UM AND YE WATTELL US ABOUT ERECTILE DIS FUNCTION WHAT YOU MOST COMMONLY SEE WHAT YOU MOST COMMONLY DO IN ORDER TO TREAT IT YE SO YOU KNOW ERECTILE TIS FUNCTION AS YOU KNOTISE SORT OF THE INABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN AN ERECTION AND IT'S FAIRLY COMMON UM YOU KNOW OF ALL THE CONDITIONS I SEE THAT STEPLY THE NUMBER ONE SO YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT MEN OVER THE AGE OF FORTY OVER HALF WILL HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH ERECTIONS UNDER AGE OF FORTY IS COBBY ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT SO THIS VERY COMMON CONDITION THAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF THE EDIOLOGY IT CAN VERY A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW USE TO THINK THAT THEY WERE PRIMARILY PSYCHOGENIC A BUT THAT WAS YOU KNOW YEARS THAT WAS DECUDES AGO NOW WE KNOW THAT MOST OF MORE ORGANIC SO IT'S ACTUALY A BLOOD FLOWIS YUE SO THE MOST COMMON CONDITIONS JUST SORT OF NATIONALLY WOULD BE THE SAME THINGS THAT CAUSE BLOOD FLOW PROBLES ANYWHRE INTHE BODY SO  BLOOD PRESSURE DIBEDIS ON AFTROS GROSSS ANYTHING THAT SORE CAN IMPAIR BLOOD GETTING YOU KNOW TO THE END ORGAN A IN SOMETIMES THE OTHER HAS BEEN DATA THAT YOU KNOW TROUBLE WITH ERECTIONS CAN ACTUALLY PREDATES OTHER MORE YOU KNOW SERIOUS YOU NOW BASCULAR CONDITIONS SO THE BLOOD MUSCLES IN THE PINUS THA PINAARTERIES ARE ABOUT ONE MILIMETER YOU KNOW AN THE  HART IN THE BRAIN THEIRE MUCH LARGER SO YOU KNITE'S MUCH EASIER TO ECCLUE A SMALL VESSEL THAN A LARGE VESSEL SO THAT'S WHY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES SUPPORT THAT A SORT OF AN EARLY MARKER FOR BASCULAR DISEASE A SO I THINK LOOKING AT THOSE RIS FACTORS YOU KNOW A SORT OF LIFE STYLE WILL BE CITY AGAIN IS ANOTHER IS A COMMON ONE A ENTERCRIN DISORDERS ACTUALLY FAIRLY SMALL IT'S PROBABLY LESS THAN TEN PER CENT PROBABLY ON FIVE PER CENT OR SO A PULBLIC CANCER TREATMENT IS ANOTHER VERY COMMON ONE AFTER YOU NOW TREATMENT FOR PROSTAY CANCER WHETHER BE RADIO THERE BE OUR SURGICAL THERE BE BLATTER CANCER AM SOMETIMES RECT OL COERECTOKINA CANCER OF THAT TREATMENT ALSO ANY TIME WERE YOU KNOW AM INVOLVING SOME OF THE NERVES IN THE THE BASCULATURE IN THE PALBAS THAT CAN ALSO IMPACT IRECTILE FUNCTION AS WELL WHAT ABUT HERNEA HURNE A THAT SHOULD BE SEPARATE SO SOMETIMES IF THERE YOU KNOW ALWAYS SAY THAT IN MEDICINE YOU CAN NEVER SAY NEVER A BUT YOU KNOW GENERALLY IF THAT WAS GETING MAN OF US ERECTILE FUNCTION WOULD PRI BE DUE TO MAYBE SOME PAIN SINTRMES CAN RARELY HAPPEN DURING THIS THE EARLY POST OPATIVE PERIOD BUT THE BLOOD SUPPLY THE NERVOUS SUPPLIES IS SEPARATE SO YOU SAY SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HER SO AM GOING TO HIGHLIGHT IT A YOU SAID THAT LESS THAN TEN PER CENT OF RECTILE THIS FUNCTION IS DUE TO A HORNMONAL ISSUE A I DO'T KNOW W R'S TIME YOU'R SPENDING ON YOU TOO EEN THE INTERNETE BUT UM THAT IS GOING TO BE A SHOCKER FOR A LOT OF MALS OUT THERE BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION ROUND TESTOSTRON IS AROUND LEBIDO IN SECUAL FUNCTION SO UM IT'S KEY FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR THAT IT'S ALSO KEY FOR THEM TO KNOW ABOUT THIS OTHER NINETY PER CENT UM WHEN YOU SAY BLOOD FLOW ISSUE THEN A WHAT IS THE COMMON FIRST PASS FOR TREATMENT AND AGAIN I FORGIVE ME FOR LISTING US OFF OVER AND OVER BUT WE ARE ASSUMING HERE THAT PEOPL'VE GOTTIN THEIR BODY WEIGHT DOWN THERE SLEEPING ENOUGH THEY'RE NOT IN JUSTING EXCESSIVE AL CALL THE'RE NOT SMOKING OR VAPING NOT SMOKING CANIBAS UM E'RE DOING THE EDIBLES ALTHOUGH MANGUISH TALK ABOUT EDIBLES AND CANIBUS AND INDIGRANE EFFECTS WILL DO THAT LATER UM DOING ALL THE THINGS RIGHT AVOIDING DOING THE WRONG THINGS TOO OFTEN OR AT LEAST COMPLETELY SO E'RE SSUMING THEIR OING ALL THAT CORRECTLY THEIR TESTOSTRON LEVELES ARE SOMEWHERE IN THAT THREE HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED NANTIGRAM PERDEST LEADER IT RANGE THAT'S TYPICAL FOR THE SO CALLED REFERENCE RANGE A IN AT LEAST IN THE YUASK OTHING T GOES UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED OR MAY BE FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND OTHER COUNTRIES BUT UM AS OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE TO POINT OUT UM BUT IT STARTS AT TOO NOW I'M JUST GETTING UM BUT ASSUMING THEIR DOING EVERYTHING CORRECTLY AND IT'S NOT ITS TESTOSTRONE ISSUE THEN IF IT'S A BLOOD FLOW ISSUE UM MEANING THEY HAVEN'T HAD TREATMENT FOR SUM PALVIT CANCER WHAT IS THE FIRST LINE OF TREATMENT YES ASSUMING THAT LIFE STYLE YOU KNOW IND ALL THAT HAS BEEN OPTOMISZE MATICAL TREATMENT HAS BENOPTOMIZE THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DO I WAYS TELL MEN AS LONG AS THEYHAVE A PENUS WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE IT HEART O THERE'S THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT I'MSURE THE ARE THE MOST UM POPULAR DOCTOR IN YOUR FIELD A THE LOUNCYAT YET THAT USUALLY DOES CINNAHEESE EVERYBODY UM SO YOU SEE WE START WITH ORLD THERE BE SO PHOSPHIAT POSPHODASTRES IN HIBITERED THERBE SO THAT WOULD BE LIKE SODENAPILLA BIAGRA TODALICAL SIALISE VENIFILL TENDRA AVERDENFILLLEBITRA WOULD YOU BE WILLIN TO TALK ABOUT SOME THE PECIFIC THER ARE YOU A IS THE TYPICAL THING TO PUT PEOPLE ON THIS TWO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MELIGRAMS PER DAY LOW DOSE OR TO AM GIVE THE HIR DOSES THAT ARE MORE COMMONLY USED A FOR RECTILE DIS FUNCTION PERSE I THINK IT DEPENDS WE KNOW WHY WE'RE PUTTING THEM ON AND HOW MUCH SECTS THEY HAVE TO YOU KNOW ON AVERAGE PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVE SECTS YOU KNOW PARTRED SECTS MAY BE ONCE A WEEK ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT MEN AN THEIR COUNT OF THIRTIESAN BEYOND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT CAN BE A FEW MORE TIMES A WEEK THAN THAT BUT YOU KNOW IF THEIR TAVING SECTS EVERY DAY ARE VERY OFTEN AND SOMETIMES A DAILY DOSE CAN BE USEFUL BUT GENERALLY MOST MEN ARE ON JUST ON DEMAN A CAZURGON TO FALL INTO THAT YOU KOW MAY BE ABOUT YOU KNOW A FEW TIMES A MONTH CATEGORY SO THAT'S USULY AR WE START AND YOU KNOW THEREARE SORT OF A TITRATION THAT CAN'T BE DONE YOU CAN GO SLIGHTLY EAN A HIERDOSES ARE LOWER DOSEAS SO USUALLY START IN THE MIDDLE TO THE HIERDOSES A AND YOU KNW WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS THEY MAY HAVE BUT THOSE PROBABLY HELP SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF MEN A AND THEY WORK WELL YOU KNOWN TERMS OF ANOTHER COMMON QUESTIONS HOW TO WE DECIDE WHICH ONE WERE GOING TO START SOMETIMES INSURANCE WILL TELL US WHICH ONE WE'RE GOING TO DO A THAT'S A COMMON ONE YOU KOW ALL THESE MEDICATIONS THEN TO BE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR ONE DIFFERENCE IT TENDS TO BE THE TIME OF ONSET YOU KNOW HOW QUICKLY THEY REACH PEAK LEVELS IN THE BODY AND THEN ALSO HOW QUICKLY THEY'RE CLEARED FROM THE BODY SO TO DALIFULS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT IN  LAST LONGER THE HALF LIFE IS ABOUT TWENTY HOURS OR SO SO IT SORT OF MARKET IT IS A WEEK END PILL SO SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE IDEA OF THAT IN TAKING A PILL ON FRIDAY STILL HAVING SOME LEFT ON SATURDAY A BUT FOR OTHERS YOU KNOW WE START WITH WITH ONE OF THE OTHER ONES THE FACT THAT THESE DRUGS LIKE TO DELLFULL A ALSO CALLSIALIS FRRITES EL TO SEALS THE BRAND NAME RIT O K AND UM VIAGAROS OUT OF BRAND NAME RT STANDS FOR A WHAT IS THE GYNERIC NAME O SE DAN A FEL SEDOM OGE A SO BECAUSE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IN SUCH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF CASES WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE VASCULAR SYSTEM OF ALL THESE MALS TATER AM HAVING IRECTILE TIS FUNCTION BUT THEN IT'S GAING RESOLVED BY THESE TRUG TREATMENTS IS THAT YOU N OTHER WORDS SOMEBODY COMES INTO YOUR CLINIC THEIR HAVING THIS ISSUE YOU PRESCRIBED AM ONE OF THESE DRUGS THEY COME BACK AND SAY EVERYTHING'S WORKING GREAT OR MAYB THEY DON'T COME BACK THEY JUST SYOUNO SEND ANYMALE SAY EVERYTHING'S SCRAT AM BUT DO YOU NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THAT PERSON ABOUT THEIR OOVER ALL VASCULAR HEALTH BECAUSE A FEW MINUTES AGO YOU TOLD US THAT THE FACT THAT THEY WEREN'T GETTING ERECTIONS DUE TO WHAT NOW APPEARS TO BE EVASCULAR ISSUE A CAN BE RESOLVED FOR THE PINAL TISSUE BUT AM IS IT CAN ASSOLVE THEIR OTHER ASCULAR ISSUES OR SOULD THOSE PEOPLE BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SREEPER OF ASCULAR CARTY OF ASCULAR DISEASE THAT CAN POTENTIALLY CAUSE THINGS AT LEAST AS BAD AS E RECTILE THIS FUNCTION MAY BE WORSE YT ABSOLUTELYWH I THINK THEY SHOULD BE SCREENED SO YOU KNOW SOMETIMES ON DIAGNOSING AND THE FIRST DOCTOR THAT THEIR SEEING AT A LONG LONG TIME A BUT OTHERWISE I DO ENCOURAGE IN TO SEE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR TO BE SCREENED FOR YOU KNOW BLOOD PRESSURE LIPID LEVELS YOU KNOW FASTING A BLOOD LUCOS ALL THOSE THINGS AGAIN SORT OF EARLY MARKERS OF SOME OF THESE SOMETIMES ARE IDENTIFIED SOMETIMES NOT BUT I THINK IT'S YOU KOW I THINK WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT SRT OF THE IDEAL PATIENT THATS PERFECT BODYWAY NOTHING ELSE IS GOING ON BUT THAT'S AS YOU KNOW VERY RARE ANTITY SO USUALY THEIRE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO BE OFTOMIZE AND I DON'T I TRY NOT TO BE ALARMIST ABOUT THIS BUT I DO WANT TO YOU KNOW ENCOURAGEMEN THAT SORT OF TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE HEALTH CAS THAT SOMETIMES CAN IMPROVE AM YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE CONDITIONS BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TERRIFICT MEDICATIONS FOR FOR MEN IN WHOM WE CANNOT WHAT ARE THE COMMONSIDE EFFECTS OF THESE TRUGS SO THERE BASE A DILATOR THEY OPEN UT BLOOD BUSCLES SO WE GET SOME OFF TARGET OF FACT SO HEADACHE FASEFUL FLUSHING BACK EGGS LIKE CRAMPS INDIGESTION NASAL CONGESTION THOSE WOULD BE THE MOST COMMON BEFORE THE LAST SUPERABLE THERE WAS SOME PRESS ABOUT THE FACT THAT A LOUT OF THE PLAYERS WERE TAKING THESE DRUGS AT LOW DUSAGEES BEFORE THE GAME PRESUMABLY TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOOD OF THEIR MUSCLES AND BRAIN AS THAT S THAT WHAT THE RATIONA WAS I THINK SO YET YOU KNW ANOTHER  WE TALKED ABOUT SORT OF HOW CYCLING MAY LEAD TO ERECTILE PROMTER SEXUAL PROMISE ER HAS BEEN SOME DATA LOOKING AT TAKING LIKE BIAGRA OR ONE OF THESE MEDICATIONS THE ALIS TO ALITHO BEFORE A RIDE AGAIN TO TRYING INCREASE CIRCULATION THO DECREASE TE CHANCE OF ANY OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF PROLONGED SADDLE PRESSURE BUT SOUNDS LIKE JUST INCREASING BLOOD FLOW AND LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE SLIGHTLY IS JUST A GOOD THING ALL AROUND YE TETHER SCERTLY ABAUTYET CAUSE THESE MEDICATIONS WERE ORIGINALLY I THINK AS ORE ALLUDING TO OR DEVELOPED AS A BLOOD PRESSURE TREATN AND THIS WAS SORT OF AN AMAZING OFF TARGET EFFECTS THAT IS TURNED INTO A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY SO YOU MENTION ABOUT TEN PER CENT OR LESS OF RECTALTIS FUNCTION IS DUE TO ENDI CRINICIUS DOES IT SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT CAN BE RESOLVED WITH A WITH THESE BLOOD FLOW IN HANCERS I KNOW IT'S A TERRIBLY NON A A NON CLINICAL NON SCIENTIFIC WAY IT DESTRIBE THE VIAGGRESS A SIALIS TO DALIPO A ET CETERA A WHAT ABOUT THE REMAINING PER CENTAGE AND ARE THERE OTHER TREATMENTS THAT A YOU YOU PRESCRIBED OR OR GIVEN A IN WHACH CASES DO YOU NEED TO A RESORT TO A I GUESS MORE IN VASIVE REPROACHES YE SO ANOTHER THERAPY WE HAVE AS YOUR REATHFUL SUPPOSITORIE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT A MEDICATION IN THE TIP OF THE PIANIST SENT ABSORBED BY THE REST OF THE PENUS ALSO INJECT ITS SUPPOSITORY AS A OGATORY OR JELL OR A JELLY YE A SO IT'S ALSO ABAS A DILATOR SORT OF THE CONCEPT IS VERY SIMILAR AND SOMETIMES THAT HE KNOWS IS O CA FOR MEN TOLERATED IT'S A SAVE FOR PARTNERS AS WELL A IT CAN TINGLE LITTLE BIT SO HE DENFATLY LET MEN KNOW IT CASM E ONE OF THE MAIN MEDICATIONS DOS CAUSELIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A A BURN AS WELL WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THIS AS UPPOSED TO TAKING THE PILLFORM OF THE DRUGS WEERE JUST TALKING ABOUT MOSTLY EFFICACY WOULD BE A BIG ONE A AND SO THIS THIS THIS CAN SOMETIMES HELP WHERE OTHERS CANNOT SO THAT'S ONE  PINAL INJECTIONS ARE ANOTHER COMMON THERAPE SO THE EFFICACY OF PINAL INJECTIONS OR POBVY EIGHTY TO NINETY PER CENT AAGAIN WERE INJECTING BAS A DILATORS INTO THE PENUS SO THE IDEA JUST OPENS UP BLOOD BUSTLES EASIER AGAIN AND O KEEP ERECTIONS YOU CAN IMAGINETHERE THE HUGE PSYCHOLOGICAL BURRIER TO PUTTING AN NEEDLE IN YOUR PENUS BET IS SOMETHING THAT THE PATIENTS ARE DOING FOR THEMSELVES AT HOME OR THAT YOU'RE DOING IS IT LONG LASTING IS THAT SOMETHING YOU DO IT THE CLENIC AND THEN THEY COME BACK EVERY FEW WEEKS OR SO NO YET THIS IS AN ONDEMAN TREATMENT SO WE WE TEACH THEM HOW TO DO AT THE FIRST TIME I DO WITH US IN CLENIC I DEALLY WE TRY AND GET A ERECTION THE LAST TWENTY TWENTY OF THIRTY MINUTE SO WE UASULY START OF THE LOW DOSE AND THEN THEY JUST INCREASE AT HOME UNTIL THEY GET BEN ON ERECTION THAT LAST FOR THAT AMOUNT OF TIME IS IT INJECTED SUBCUTANEOUS SIR ACTUALLY INTO THE UM GOOD NISS A THE METEOR TISSUE OF OF THE PENUS THAT'S RIGHT INTO THE ERECTILE BODIES DIRECTLY AND THEY YHE ONLY HAVE THEM JECK ONE SIDE THEY DO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER MOST MENS TAT'S FIND IT'S HE SMALL ET'T VERY SMALL GAGE NEED ALL ABOUT HIS BEGAZINA A FEW STRANS IP HERE  HAVING BEEN POINTMENT OVER IN OPTHEMOLOGY AND I AVE SEEN INJECTIENTS IN TO THE HUMAN EYEBALL AND IT IS INCREDIBLE HOW FAST AND HOW PAINLESS THAT PROSEDURE IS WHEN IT'S DONE BY THE RIGHT PERSON NOBODY SHOULD TRY THAT AT HOME ON THEIR OWN BUT WHEN IS DONE BY A SEALED OTHEMOLOGIST IS JUST STRIKING IN A HER YOU THING ABOUT NEEDLE IN THE EYE WE KNOW WHAT'S WORSE SLIKE THE CHILDHOOD WHEN IM WRITES STOCKANEEDLING MY TECAN THING OF ANYTHING WORSE BUT UM MAYBE YOU KNOW AN INJECTION THE PENU SOUNDS ALMOST AS BAD BUT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT IF PATIENTS ARE PRESCRIBED THIS THAT THEY CAN DO THIS WITH WITH LIMITED IF ANY DISCOMFORT WELL IT DOES HAVE A HIGHDROP OUTRIGHT SURPRISED SURPRES UBE KNOWIN'S EXCITED ABOUT IT YOU KNOIT GUESS THE MOOD CAN SOMETIMES WE EFFECTED BUT A LOT OF COUPLES ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH IT AGAINST VERY AFFICATIONS THE PART THE MAN CAN DO IT IS PARTNER CAN DO IT UM SO IT DOES WORK WELL AND I I GUESS HERE WERE SORT OF ASENDING THE THE LIST OF A INVASIVENESS I UM WHAT WHAT IS THAT THAT THE SORT OF TOP TEER OF INVASIVENESS FOR A FRIRKED OL ES FUNCTION SO THEN WE GO IN TO PENOTIN CLANTS SO THEREIS ACTUALLY A CURTICAL PROCEEDER WE CAN DO TO PUT A TO BICE INSIDE THE PENUS THAT CAN HELP MEN BE HARD WHEN THEY WANT TO AND THAT COMES IN SORT OF TWO MAIN FORMS THERE'S EITHER NOT INFLATABLE OR INFLATABLE SO THE NOT A FLATABLE SORT OF A BENDABLE AM IT'S YOU KNOW HAS SORT OF A METAL CORPS AND SO WHEN MEN DON' ON HAVE SEX THEY BENDED DOWN WHEN THEY READY FOR SEX THET CAN KIND OF BEND IT OUT IS TO EALLY JUST THERE ON DEMAND YES E INTERESTING YE SO IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO USE AM SORT OF THE MORE I GUESS M FOR A NATURAL FORM TO BE THE INFLATABLE SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING AT ITS DEFLATED THAN WHEN EUREADITY USE IT IT'S INFLATED AND YOU'VE INFLATE IT WITH BASICALLY A PUMP THAT'S IN THE SCROTUM SO ALL THIS IS SORT OF SURGICALLY EMPLANTED INSIDE A MAN ALL UNDER THE SKIN YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL IF A MAN HASITOR DOESN'T HAVIN BUT WHEN HE'S READY HOU PUMPS IT UP AND IT MOVES FLUID FROM A RESERVOIR WHICH USELY IS ALSO ALSO SURGEICALLY IMPLANTED INTO THE PENIS TO GET A REIRECTION WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGICAL AROUSAL AN ERECTION AS IT RELATES TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES IM IN THE WAY YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT SOUNDS PURELY MECHANICAL IT AM WHICH I'M A NOCTURNAL ERECTIONS WHICH I SUPPOSE PEOPLE COULD BE HAVING EROTIC DREAMS BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A A PREREQUISITE FOR NOCTURNAL OR ERECTIONS AT ALL RIGHT SO AM IS THE IDEA THAT IF ADEQUATE BLOOD FLOW IS ACHIEVED THEN ANY SIGNAL FROM THE BRAIN CAN INITIATE A CASCADE OF BLOOD FLOW THAT CREATES THE ERECTION OR IS IT THE CASE WITH SOME OF THESE TREATMENTS THAT A SONDS A BLOOD FLOW IS ALMOST AM AUTONOMIST RIGHT WHLI THINK A LOT OF THESE AM YET THE BLOOD FLOW IS NOT ADEQUATE AND THAT'S WHYT WE'RE HAVING TO YOU KNOWIES WHERE TO GO BEYOND BUT GENERALLY IS TO POINT OUT THERE'S DIFFERENT STIMULATION WHETHER IT BE YOU KNOW VISUAL TACTILE OR FACTORY A IT SORT OF START STAT CASCADE THAT RELEASES NEAR  TRANSMITTERS IN THE PENUS THAT LEADS TO THE SPASE ADILATION YOU KNOW NATURALLY AND MEN GET ERECTIONS A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS READING ABOUT AM TAS OPPRESSIN INHALMENTS YOU KNOW THERE AS A MUNCH OF STUFF HITTING THE MARKET AM BY THE WA Y I DON'T SUGGEST ET PEOPLE AM GET EXPERIMENTAL WITH THE STUFF I YOU KNOW HAS A NER SCIENTIST WHO ALSO AM KNOWS A THING ABOUT A NERPEPTIDES AND ER HORMONES THAT CAN IMPACT THE HYPOTHAL MA CEKNOI JUST I I JUST COVER MY EYES IN ON OF AM CRINGE WHEN I THINK ABOUT PEOPLE IN HALING THEY SOPPRESS AND THINKING OH YE O THERE'S A STUDY THAT IS OPPRESSIN INCREASE OF SEXUAL DESIRE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AM BUT NOWADAYS I'M READING LOT MORE ABOUT A REALLY INTERESTING PAPTIDE IM TREATMENT WHICH I THINK IT'S A AFTER A PROVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG WHICH IS AM RELATES TO A A A MALANASITE STIMULATING HORMONE THAT COMES OUT OF THE MEDIAL PATUITARY AM THAT IS USED TO INCREASE SEXUAL DESIRE IT'S PRESCRIBED FOR WOMEN AM BUT MEN ARE STARTING TO TAKE IT A AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE AT LEAST FROM WHAT YOU READ ON THE INTERNET AM A PRETTY PROFOUND IMPACT ON LABIDO AND ON ERECTILE FREQUENCY AND PERSISTENCE M IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW ITS YOUR USING IN YOUR CLINIC A A YNOW WHAT WHAT ABOUT THESE BAPTIDES THAT PEOPLE ARE INHALING AND ENJACTING AND SOME OF THEM ARE TAKEN IN ORAL FORM BUT MOST OFTEN I THINK IT'S NASAL ANHALINT OR AM A OR IT'S A A SUBCUTANEOUS INJACTION YES SO IM THOSE ARE NOT ONES THAT THAT WE IS IN CLINIC BUT I THINK YOU KNOW LOOKING A SORT OF JUST SEXUAL DISFUNCTION BROADLY THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW WE DO TRY AND HELP IM AN ONE OF THINGS SORT OF THAT I KIND OF RELATES TO THAT THAT IS IT'S BEEN A PROPOSED TREATMENT FOR IT IS THIS CONCEPT OF THE LATE ORGAASM OR DELATE EJACULATION SO I THINK EVERYBODY'S FAMILIAR WITH PREMATURE EJACULATION RI WER MAN EJACULATE TOO QUICKLY I BUT ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTIOM THERE'S MEN THAT TAKES YOU KNOW A LONG TIME TO EJACULATE AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS IS YOU SORT OF DEFINE DIFFERENTLY BUT GENERALLY MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY LIKE SORT OF TWO STANDARDEVIATIONS ABOVE AVERAGE ON AVERAGE PROBPING AROUND FIVE MINUTES OR SO TWO STANDAR DEVIATIONS WOULD BE CAN TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE MINUTES OF FOR MEN TO TAKE THAT LONG TO EJACULATE THAT OULD BE CONSIDERED DELAYED OR SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EJACULATE EVERY TIME THAT THEY H NO HAVE RELATIONS SO FOR THOSE I THINK THERE IS IN NEED FOR TREATMENT BECAUE THERE'S NO EF TO APPROVE THEIROTY FOR THAT UM AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINKING OF PROVIDERS OR TRYING SOME OF THESE OTHER HE KNOW MORE EXPERIMENTAL THINGS UM THERE' SOME THAT WE USE TOST NOT THAT ONE IN PARTICULAR UM THERE'S ALSO SOME DEVICES THAT HAVE BEEN TRIWALLED AS WELL TUT IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE NOW I CERTINLY REALLY FEEL FOR THESE MEN E IT'S ONE OF THE PLEASURES IN LIFE UE AND SOME OF EM ARE NEVER ABLE TO HAVE SECTS AR ONLY OR S RI NEVERLABLE TO ORGASM AN SOME ARE ONLY ABLE TO DO IT VERY RARELY SO WE DO ON OF FER THE BENEFIT WHAT ABOUT PELVIC FLOOR HEALTH MORE GENERALLY E THE TOPIC OF PELVIC FLOOR HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT COMES UP MORE OFTEN AROUND FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND YEUROLOGY UM YERE ABOUT KEEGLES KAGLES EEGLES I OH KNO I IS WILL HAVE TO ASK HIM TO THE TURNS OUT KEEGELL KEGL WAS A PERSON EM WHO NAMED THE EXERCISE AFTER HIMSELF UM WITH AN HE DID THEM I DO NOT KNOW BUT U MINORSTANDIGS THAT KEGELES OR A PELVLIC FLOOR STRENGTHENING EXERCISE UM AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE YURINARY OR SEXUAL DISFUNCTION BECAUSE OF A OVERLY RELAXED A KA WEAK PELVIC FLOOR BUT THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE EXACTING PROBLEMCE BECAUSE OF A HIPER CONTRACTED A KA A OVERLY TENSE TIGHT STRONG PELVIC FLOOR MEANING DON'T RUN OUT INST OUR DOING KAGELES JUST ASE YOU HEARD ABOUT THEM THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR EVERYBODY THEY MIGHT BE BAD FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE BUT WHAT ABOUT PELVIC FLOOR HEALTH I MEAN SHOULD MEN BE PAYING ATTENTION TO PUVIC FLOOR HEALTH SHOULD MEN BE DOING PUBVIC FLOOR EXERCISES I MA THICK IT'SHROUGH LE KEY THAT YOU SAY THAT AS YOU KNOW NOT EVERYTHING HEREABOUT IS GOOD AND I THINK IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE RIGHT PERSONS SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY MEN THAT I SEE THAT HAVE VERY NO JUST A LOT ATTENTION LOT OF ANXIETY SOMETIMES THESE MEN YOU NOW BURINATE EVERY HOUR I MEAN THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAN YOU CAN JUST TELL THEIR SORT OF VER E WOUND UP AND I THINK FOR THAT MAN YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES TOU CONT OF ALLUDE TO AS HE PROPINESE RELAX MORE SO YOU KNOW PELVIC FLOOR PHYSICAL THERAPY CAN STILL BENEFIY ECAUSE THERE ARE SOME JUST DIFFERENT FEED BACK EXERCISE THAT COULD BE DONE TO HELP WITH RELAXATIONS SO YOU KNOW ANY ER ALLGOUS OFFICERS USUALISTS A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AROUND THE REGION THAT CAN HELP WITH SOME OF THESE A PEGAL EXERCISE THOUGH IT CAN BE USEFULINOR FOR EXAMPLE FOR A MI PROSTAT CANSO REHABILITATIONS SOME OF THESE MEN FORWARD TRYING TO CANTO REBUILD SOME OF THE STRENGTH OR MAINTAINED OR IMPROVE CONTINENTS IN THESE MEN WE DO WANT A STRENGTHEN SOME OF THESE MUSCLES SO THAT THEY CAN TOR RECREATOR REPLACE WHAT WAS LOST WHEN THE PROSTRATE WAS REMOVED SO I THINK FOR THE RIGHT MAN THEY CAN' BE USEFUL BUT YET IT COULD BE A DANGEROUS TOOL IN THE WRONG HANDS AND YOU MENTION THAT IF YOUPL WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT PELVIC FLOORTHERAPY UM VACAN CONTACT THEIR LOCAL EUROLOGIST AND FIND A GOOD PELVIC FLOOR GOOD MALE PELVIC FLOOR SPECIALIST DO THEY TEND TO SPECIALIZE MALE FEMALE THEY USUALLY A PRETTY MUCH GENDER SEXAGNOSTIC SO THEY USUALLY ARE ABLE TO HELP ALL AND A FORGIVE ME FOR A ASKING FOR IN A BRIDGE TENATOMY LESSEN HERE BUT UM COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE BLATTER PROSTRATE YOURETHROPENUS ANADOMY THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT BEFORE CAUSE I HAVE THE PICTURE OF THE BLATTER YOUREATHROU PROSTRATE PENUS IN MY BRAIN UM I KNOW UM BY A LIFE EXPERIENCE WHERE THE TESTES AND SCROW TO MORE RELATIVES ALL THAT BUT IT NOW IN TRYN TO FIGURE OUT A OUT LIKE TO THE PELVIC FLOOR BMUNCH OF MUSCLES THAT THAT ARE ATACH TO THE PELVIS BUT HOW DO THEY INTERACT WITH THOSE A WITH THOSE ORGANS YET YOUD QUESTIONS SO THEY SIT BENEATH YOU KNOW THE SORT IN THE PARANIUMS O THE AREA BETWEEN THE SCRODUM AND THE ANUS AND BA BEYOND TOO SO THEY BASICALLY SUPPORT ALL THE STRUCTURES THERE THEY SUPPORTS YOU KNOW THE BASE OF THE PENUS THE PROSTATES THE BLATTER THE RECTEM AND YOU KNOW THERE THE CANA KEET MAN YU KNOW ADEQUATE TENSION TO KEEP A L THE STRUCTURES UP THEY RELAX WHEN U NO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ARE NECESSARY THEY VERY IMPORTANT FOR EJACULATION I MEAN A SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY CONT OF TRIGER SOME OF THE ORGASMIC RESPONSE AS WELL AM YEU KNOW SOME TIMES MEN WILL HAVE INU PAIN IN THAT ARE IN THE PARANEL AREA CAN TRANSMITE TO OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY LIKE THE SCROTUM OU KNOW ONE OF THAT ONE CAUSE OF SCRODAL PAIN AND THERE CAN BE MANY CAN SOMETIMES IN PUBLIC FLOOR DISPUNCTION SO I THINK OU N AGAIN PESPULIFOR THERAPE CAN BE USEFUL FOR A SORT OF A CONSTOLATION OF SYMPTOMS AGAINST SOME URINARY SYMPSTOMS AS WELL SO I THINK FOR SOME PATIENTS IT CAN BE HELPFUL BUT IM YOU KNOW AGAIN THER IF IF YGET THINKS TWO TENSE I BAK CAN SOMETIMES BE HARMFUL SO PRESUMABLY THESE PUBLIC FLORITHERAPIS ALSO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE A MORE RELAX PUBLIC FLOORISH THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED EXACT GOT IT GOING TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT UM CAME BACK TO ME WHEN I SOLICITED FOR QUESTIONS AND IN SUSPICION OF THIS EPISODE UM SEVERAL NOT A FEW A LET'S SAY COUPLE DOZEN PEOPLE ASKED ABOUT SPLIT YOUR IN STREAME IS THAT A SIGNATURE OF PROSTRATE OVERGROWTH IS THAT A A EURETHRAL ISSUE IS IT PERFECTLY NORMAL A I'M ASSUMING HERE THEY MEAN A SSPLIT STREAME OF YOURE IN THAT DOESN'T UNIFY AT ANY POINT THER TOWING ABOUT A CONSISTENTLY SPLIT YOURE INSTREME AND FOR THOSE WHO YHU DON'T KNOW I AM TALKING ABOUT OR TELKING ABOUT A YOUR INSTREME THAT'S ICH TO YOUR INSTREMES AND WE'RE ASSUMING ONE YOURETHRO OPENING CAUSE I HIT THE LITERATURE ON THIS AND AM THERE IS A CASE OF A FAILURE TO FULLY FUSE THOEG EURETHRAL DOC DURING DEVELOPMENT WHERE PEOP SOM I MOSSUMING SMALL FRACTION OF MALS HAVE A YOU RETHR OPENING ON THE BASE OF THE PINUS AND AT THE TIP OF THE PENUS WAT'S RULE THAT OUT AS A  IMPOSSIBILITY FOR NOW UM BUT NOW THAT IT'S ON THE TABLE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF MALS HAVE THAT SA TO YOURETHRAL OPENINGS SO WELL HYPOSPADIOS MAT YOUARE DESCRIBING WHERE THE THE ACTUAL MEATUS IS NOT AT THE TIP BUT ITS CANTIS ALONG THE APROXIMLIORETHROUG OR YOU KNW EVEN FURTHER DOWN SOMETHINES IN THE SCROTUM PRI ABOUT ONE PERCENTIBERS UM AND USUALLY IT'S RECOGNIZE IT BIRTH AND OFTENTIMES IT SURGICALLY CORRECTED CAUSE BETTER TO PREPARED EARLY RATHER THAN LATER O K SO RULING THAT OUT EM WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF SPLIT YOUR IN DREAMIN IS IT AM A SIGNATURE OF A LARGER ISSUE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS  WE YOU KNOW YUR INA SORT OF AM FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY STAMP MY RITIS TO YOU KNEW BASICALLY DEPOSITE SORT OF A CONVENIENT TIME OUR WAYS AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET AT EVERYWHERE WE DON'T WANT ASORT OF LABEL OURSELVES AM WITH SMELL OF YOURINCS IT'LL BE EASIER FOR PREDITORS TO TO BEOLD IDENTIFI SOI JST SIMILAR TO TO DAY WE LIKE EVERYTHING TO GET IN THE TOILET WITHOUT CREATING A MASTSO ANY TIME THERE'S TURBULENT FLOW M IT YOUAD CERTAINLY COUN SIGNAL IN NIN ISSUE SO IT COULD BE LIKEY RETHROSHITES ORE POINTING OUT A PROSTATIC ISSUE ANADEQUATE SPEED YOU KNOW OF GETTING ER AN ALDIMIETUS SO OUDETLY SHOULD SEE YOU KNOW PHYSICIAN TO GET AVALUATED BECAUSE THERE'S LIKELYSOME ISSUE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED THE  MOST POPULAR QUESTION I RECEIVED FROM MALES HOWEVER WAS ABOUT PERHAPS NO SURPRISE PEANUS LIFE YOU 'RE AN EXPERT IN THIS ACTUALLY M NOT JUST BECAUSE HERE A EUROLOGIST MAIL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EXPERT WAT AM YOU PUBLISH A STUDY RECENTLY ON THE CHANGING TRIENDS IN PINAL LENGTH A TELL US ABOUT THAT STUDY I'VE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT AM THE METHODOLOGY BECAUSE AM I HAVE TO ASSUME THI STINT INVOLVE SELF REPORT RIT THOSE WERE EXCLUDED YA TASO AM LYING WAS EXCLUDED A THIN FACITIOUS HERE BUT A YEHOW WAS THIS STUDY DONE I MA PRETTY INCREDIBLE STUDY AM AND THE RESULTS ARE I DON'T KNIFE THERE SURPRISING OR NOT A I FIRST I THOUGHT OH THIS IS SURPRISING BUT THE RESULTS WERE ONLY SURPRISING AND LIGHT OF WHAT YOU WERE TIGT EARLIER ABOUT SPERM IN TUSTOSTRO NOTICE I THINK A I'LL LET YOU DISTRIBE THE STUDY NOW RATHER THAN THAN GIVING PEOPLE THE PUNCH LINE HERE YES SO I MEAN THAT WORSHIN WAS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WE WANTED NO AVERAGE LENGTH SOR ANOTHER PROJECT THAT WE WERE DOING AND OU KNOW GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR DECADES YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT REASONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED PN LENGTHING T SOMETIMES THEY DO IT I JUST ON VOLUNTEERS AGAINST SORT OF GET THE AVERAGE LENGTHS OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS SOMETIMES IT'S DONE PREAN PROSURGICALLY TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT CHANGES WOULD OCCUR A SO WE JUST SORT OF COLD THE LITERATURE FOUND DATA ON FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN ALL OVER THE WORLD A AND WANTE AS YET THERE IS A YOU KNOW A SORT OF A TIME PATTERN WITH THAT AND SIMILAR T YOUR HYPOTHESIS WE ASSUME BASED ON ALL THE OTHER DATA THAT WE WOULD LIKELY SEE A DECLINE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT BE NO CHEMICAL AND BIREMENAL EXPOSURE BUT IF NOTHING ELSE IF WE'RE GETTING BIGGER YOU KNOW THE FUNCTION AL PINO LENGTH SHOUD DECLINE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE SUPERPUBIC FAT PAD WILL GET A LITTLE A BIGGER AND SO WI'LL CON O LOSE PINO LENGTH WITH THAT AND SO MUCH TO OUR SURPRISE THE SUPERPEVIC  ADSCUS ME OF BEING THE PAT OF FAT DIRECTLY OVER THE PINO  R AND SO YOU KOW I FACT GETS BIGGER THAT'LL NECESSARILY COMPROMISE PENOU LENGTH BUT YOU KNOW YOU ALLUDED TI WE FOUND HIS ACTUALLY OPPOSITE THAT A THE PENISIS WORERE GETTING GETTING LONGER WITH TIME SO HOW IT'S MEASURED MEAURE DIFFERENTLY SO ONE OF OUR INCLUSION CRITER WAS THAT ALL THE STUDIES HAD HAVE MEASURED FORT OF IN AND OFFICE SORT OF IN A CLINICAL SETTING SO WHETHER IT BE A YOU KNOW A CLINITION OR WHETHER BE A RESEARCHOR THAT ACTUALLY DID IT SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN MEASURE PENUS YOU CAN JUST DO A STRETCH LENGTH SYOU CANT O STRETCH IT UP AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND THEN YU SORT OF A RULER TO MEASURE HOW LONG IT IS AGAIN FROM SDEEP AS YOU CAN GET YOU KNOW THE PUPUBIC BONE IDEALLY UP TO THE TIP OF THE A THE GLANS OR TH ABASO HEARES WO AT HES DESCRIBE HES TALKING BOUT MEASURING FROM THE TOP NO IN THE BOTTOM BELEF NOT U GLAST QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS MEASURING FROM THE TOP NOP FROM THE BOTTOM NO CHEATING A UTIME AT STRETCHING THE INIS WALIT'S FLACID PRESUMABLY AND THEN MEASURING FROM SSENTIALLY CONTACT WITH A LOCATION THAT'S CONTACT WITH THE PUBIC BONE TO THE THE TIP RIHT O SO THAT THAT LENGTH WAS RECORDED IN FIFTY THOUSAND MEN  WELL YEW SO THAT WAS ONE AND THAT WE ALSO LOOKED AT ERECTLING AND SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS THAT AN ERECTION CAN BE ACHIEVED SORT OF AN A CLENICAL STUDING SO ONE AS YOU COULD ASK THE MAN TO STIMULATE HIMSELF AND THEN MEASURE SO THAT WAS SOME OF THE STUDIES AND THEN THE OTHER METHOD WE HAVE LUTED TOO EARLIER AS YOU COAN INJECT THE MAN WITH THE MEDICINE TO GIVE THE ERECTION AND THEN MEASURE IT AND DID FIFTY THOUSAND MEN PARTICIPATE IN THAT ASPECT OF THE STUDY IT WAS LESS NOW THAT WAS THAT ITHINK THAT WAS ABOUT PROBY TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN I HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER NOT IT'S EASY OR DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO RECRUIT SUBJECTS FOR THESE STUDIES I DON'T KNOW I COULD SEE IT GOING BOTH WAYS YES SOME OF THE STUDIES ACTUALLY HAD A TREMENDOUS NUMBER HAD ABOUT UM LIKE FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN SOME INDIVIDUAL TUDIES CONTRIBUTED THAT AND ACTUALL INTERESTING AFTER WE PUBLISHED THAT THERE WERE SOME MEN THAT VOLUNTEERED FOR THE NEXT STUDY TO BE MEASURED I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME OF THEM AFTER THIS UP TISUM WHAT WAS THE MAJOR FINDING SO THE MAJOR FINALLY WANTED TO DO AS JUS GIVE NORMAN TO DATA WE FOUND THAT IT VARIED AROUND THE WORLD SO BASED ON DIFFERENT REGIONS M THE AVERAGES LENGTHS YOU KNOW VARIED A LITTLE BIT BUT GENERALLY ON AVERAGE AM ERECT PEEN US IS PRIVATEEN ABOUT FIVE TOR SIX INCHES SOMEWHERE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD SO THAT WAS FINE OF TO TAKE HOMEY O WAS THE AVERAGE THE AVERAGE FIRRECTLY ID YOU PUBLISH THE FULL DISTRIBUTIONS AH WE DIDN' NOT THIA WE WERE WERE WERE OUR PLAN WAS ACTUALLY TO MAKE A FOLLOW ON STUDY SO WE CAN SHOW EVERYBODY YOU KNOW I GUESS PROBABLYTHEY WERE INTERESTED WHERE THEY CON IT FELL ON THE GROUND BUT IT WAS FAIRLY YOU KNOW AS NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED YET I WOULD THINK THAT UM DESPITE THE U YOU KNOW THE WIDE AVAILABILITY OF PORNOGRAPHY THAT UM THAT THE DISTRIBUTIONS LIKE THE SCATTER PLOTS OF ALL THE DATA  WOULD BE INTERESTING TO MEN UM FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THE TESTOSTRONE BY FUNCTION OF AGE DATA PUBLISH H AS A SCATTERED PLOT IN THAT TEXTBOOK E REFERRED TO EARLIER I VER INTERESTING BECAUSE AM THE SCATTER PLOT DISTRIBUTIONS PIC A POINTO A OTHER TAKE AWAYS THAT ONE CAN BE IN THEIR SEVENTIES AND HAVE TESTOSTRO LEVELS EQUIVALENT TO A MALE AND HEALTHY MAL IN HIS THIRTIES THAT ONE CAN BE IN THEIR THIRDIYS AND HAVE TESTOSTRO LEVELS THAT ER TWICE AS MUCH OR HALF AS MUCH AS AS H MATCH COHORT THIS KIND OF THING A THINK THAT THERE'S VALUE IN THAT SO A WHAT WHAT OTHER TAKE AWAYS A ARRIVED WITH THE DATA FROM THE PINUST LENGTH STUDY THAT PERHAPS WE DIDN'T WE DIDNT HEARE ABOUT LY WHAT D WHAT DO YOU FIND MOST INTERESTING ABOUT ABOUT THE DATA WELLTHAT THERE WAS ANY CHANGE OFER TIME YOU NOTICERS AE PRETTILY SHORT A STUDY WAS PRY ABOUT NO THIRTY YEARS OR SO  BUT WE DID FIND THE PINA LENGTH HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER TIME SO A YOU KNOW THAT WAS JUST SORT AF FASCINING THAT WE WOULDSEE SORT OF IN SUCH A SHORT INTERVAL OF TIME TAT THEIR BE CHANGE NUMBER ONE BUT THAT WE ULD SEE A LENGTHENING NUMBER TWO SO YU KNO AGAIN SIMILAR TO THE CONCERNS AR ROSE FOR THESE YOUKNOWERELSE WIULL BE SHORT PRIOD OF TIME WHERE YOU WOULD SEE CHANGES IN SEAMEN QUALITY  YOU KNOWT SUGGEST SOMETHING SINISTER IT IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE GENETIC CHANGE BECAUSE THAT WOULD TAKE YOU KNOW CENTURIES PROBABLY I CERTAINLY SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF THE FACT THAT THIS HAPPEN SO QUICKLY A WAS JUST SURPRISING A THIS BRINGS TO MIND SOME OF WORK THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN YEARS AGO AM WHEN I WAS A MASTER SUDEN I STUDIED A EARLY ORGANIZING EFFECTS OF HORMONES ON A THE BRAIN EMBODY AND A MI'M SURE THIS HAS BEEN UP DATED A SINCE THAT BUT AM MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT A DURING EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT MALES A ARE EXPOSED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DIHYDRO SESTOSTRON NOT TESTOSTROM BOUL DIHADRE TESTOSTROM WHICH ORGANIZES THE BRAIN MALE AS THEY USED TO SAY NOW THE THE THE VERBAGE AROUND TAT WOULD PROUABLY BE A LOBIT DIFFERENT BUT  THE IDEAS THAT A MAL ELS ARE BORN A WITH PINAL TISSUE OF COURSE BUT THEN IT DURING PUBERTY THAT THE SAME HORMONE DIADR TESTOSTRON THEN EXERTS AN ACTIVATING EFFECTS ON THE GENERTALS AND THE GENETALS GROW DURING PUBERTY PINUS LENGT INCREASES SO ASSUMING THAT THE STUDY THAT YOU DID WAS ON MALES A POSTPUBERTY RIT MASSUMING IT WAS AM THEN IT WOULD IMPLY THAT SOME THINGS CHANGING ABOUT THE LEVELS OR THE SIGNALING RELATE TO DIHADRATISTOSTRON A HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN UM DO WE HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING I MEAN THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENDERGRAN DISROPTORS PREVENTING SPERM FROM BEING AS OU N OW HIGH QUALITY AND NUMEROUS AS THEY COULD BE OR FOR YOU KNOW ER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS EITHER IN UTERO OR POSTUDERO AM SUPPRESSING TESTOSTRO LEVELS HERE WERE TI M BY THE OPPOSITE IF IT WERE TIE A DIHADR TESTOSTRO LEVELS PRESUMALY BEING HIGHER IN MALES OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND THEREBY LONGER PENISES RIGHT SO I MEAN TAT THERE'S DIFFERENT CONJECTURES THAT YOU COULD MAKE ABOUT WHY THIS COULD HAPPEN THE MENIT COULD BE YOU MAY BE ENDERCRAN DESTRUCTING CHEMICALS YOU KNOWING UTERO SOME EARLY EXPOSURE YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE MOTHERS HAD TO CONIHANDROGANIC EFFECTS DURING THE MAL PROGRAMMING WINDOW THA MAYHAV LEDS O SOME LONGER LENGTHS A ANOTHER HYPOPESIS WE HAD AS THAT IF MALES ARE GOING THROUGH PUBERTY EARLIER THE EARLIER ONE GOES THROUGH PUBERTY THE LONGER LENGTH TENDS TO BE SO MAYBE THAT PROVIDES SORT OF THIS LENC TO EARLIER PUBERTY TENDS TO BE LONGER BUT POTENTIALLY MEANS LONGER DURATION EXPOSURE TO DIAGRATISTOSTRON LONGER PINISES YET YOU MAY BE SURPRISED IN TO KNOW YOU MITE NOT BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A A SUB CULTURE ON LINE I KNOW BECAUSE THEY CONTACTED ME AN ANTICIPATION OF THIS EPISO HUM OF AM POST PUBERDOL MALES WHO TAKE A COMMINATION OF DIHADRATISTASTRON AND LOW LEVELS OF GROWTHHORMON IN E FORTS TO TRY AND INCREASE THEIR PINAL LENGTH AND THAT THE AM ONES TAKING DIHYDROTISTOSRAN THEY'RE NOT TAKING PUR DH  THEIR TAKING THINGS LIKE OXANDREL ON AM WHICH VERY CLOSELY MEMICS THE STRUCTURE OF D H T A THEY REPORT A SOME SUCCESS AM FORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT SEND ME PICTURES AM OTHERWISE IT WOUL I AFORIDO THEM TO YOU FOR YOUR NEXT STUDY AM BUT THIS STUFF IS HAPPENING A A IN POSTPUBRDOL MAL SO AM IT IT ALL RESTS ON THIS DIHYDROTISTOSTRON HYPOTHESIS AA JUST A POINT OF INTEREST A I DO'T KNOW ATPHYSIOLOGICAL LY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WUT THAT WOULD WORK AS YEU'R TWENTY UP POST PUBERTALY AN LIM LESS THEYRE DOING OTHER THINGS UNIT SOME SORT OF STRETCHING EXERCISES OR CALLED JOLKING BUT YE I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT THANK YOU THAT WAS THE RESPONSE I WAS LOOKING FOR SO A THAT COMMUNITY WILL BE LISTENING WITH EM A OPEN EARS DON'T DO IT AS OONS WERE TALKING ABOUT D H T DIHYDRO TISTOSTRON AM IT'S ONLY FAIR TO DISCUSS THE DRUGS THAT MANY PEOPLE TAKE TO SUPPRESS TIHYDROTESTOSTRON IN HOPES TO KEEP OR GROW THEIR HAIR THINGS LIKE FINASTERIDE DU TASTERIDE M SOME MAYBE MANY NOT ALL PEOPLE WHO TAKE THESE TRUGS PARTICULARLY IN ORAL FORM EXPERIENCE A SEXUAL DISFUNCTION ISSUES AM AND OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO SUPPRESING D H T THAT SAID MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE DRUGS ARE ALSO QUITE USEFUL MAYBE VEN LIFE SAVING IN SOME CASES FOR UM STAVING OFF CERTAIN FORMS OF PROSTATE CANCER WHAT RE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT FINASTERIDE DE TASTRIDE DO YOU SEE PEOPLE COMING INTO YOUR CLINIC WHO ARE HAVING SEXUAL DISFUNCTION OR OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES BECAUSE OF THEIR HEIR OR ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN OR GROW THEIR HAIR ISSUES AND AM EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT SO CALLED POSTFINASTERIDE CINDRUM I GOT A LO OF QUESTIONS ABOUT POSTS PHINASTRITE CINDRUM UM BECAUSE I'LL DESCRIBE IT IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES UM IT SEUNDS PRETTY DEVASTATING FOR THESE PEOPLE'S LOKES EM AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY IT'S SO DEVASTATING FOR THEM E IN A MOMENT BUT YET WHAT ABOUT FINASTERIDE YOU TASTERIDE IN THESE DRUGS THAT ARE EFFECTUAELY DEAGED TEA BLOCKERS EM DT LEVELS IF THEY GET TOO HIDE INDEED CAN MANYTRIES THE HAIR FOLICAL CAUSE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HAIR TYPICALLY A FRONT OR IN THE BACK CRYSO CALLED CROWN OR WHATEVER YOU NA WIDOWS PEAK A A OR EVERYWHERE IN SOME CASES U IT ALSO NUSE HIS HAIRGROWTH ON THE BACK BEARD GROWTH AS WE UNDERSTAND BUT THEN PEOPLE GO AND TAKE THESE DRUGS TO TRY AND MAINTAIN A GROW THEIR HAIR AND OFTENTIMES THEY HAVE ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION OR OTHER ISSUES IS THAT SURPRISING TOYO YOU KNOW I THINK THE MEN THAT WE SEE THESE EM THESE SIDE EFFECTS ARE ARE TEND TO BE NO YOUNGER MEN IN THEIR TWENTIES THIRTIES AND FORTIES AND THEY TAKE IT AS YOURE POINTING OUT FOR HAIR LOSS SO BEFORE WAS EFTY A PROVE FOR THAT INDICATION OF THESE FINASTERIDE WAS YOU NOW THEY DID RANOMIZE CONTROLL TRIALS TO LOOK EM AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WWILL TALK ABOUT TWO AS TIS REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS SO THEY DID  KNOW LOTS OF STUDIES TO SEE IF THERE WERE CHANGES IN SEAMEN QUALITY YOU KNOW FOR MEN ON FINASTERI ADVERSES OF LOSEIBO AND THERE WERE SOME VERY SUBTLE CHANGES BUT YOU KNOW A SORT OF IN POSTMARKETY NOW WE SEE THESE PATIENTS AND CLINIC EM YOU KNOW EVERYBODY TO ENROLL IN THESE STUDIES HAD NORMAL FUNCTIONS I THINK THAT SORT OF IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND OBBE SY THAT'S NOT LIFE RIGHT THET PEOPLE COME IN WITH SORT OF DIFFERENT BASE LINES AND DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF RESERVE AND SO WE NOW KNOW THAT THERE'S PROBABLY PEOPLE THAT ARE A LOT MORE SENSITIVE TO THESE MEDICATIONS THAN OTHERS AND SO THERE'S SOME MEN THAT DROP THEIR FIRM COUNTS DRAMATICALLY AND USUALLY IF WE ARE WE STOP THESE MEDICATIONS THEIR FIRM COUNTS CAN RECOVER OU NO USE US FROMATAGENIC CYCLES PROBIY ABOUT TWO TO THREE MONTHS SO USUALLY AND MAY BE THREE TO SIX MONTHS WE USUALLY SEE RECOVERY FOR MOST MEN UM BUT SIMILARLY FOR YOU NO SEXUAL FUNCTION I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW HAVE A NUMBER PATIENTS YOU KNOW THE DUE COMPLAIN OF LOLIBIDO ERECTILE FUNCTION THIS POSTFINASTERIDE CINDRUM IM YOU KNOW IN THE MECHANISMS I THINK ORE LESS CERTAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW MEASURING TASTOSRA LEVELS WHICH WE DO YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IF ANDERGENS OR LOW OR EVEN IF ANDERSEN SEEM TO BE IN THE MAYBE NORMAL RANGE OR LOW NORMAL RANGE WILL TRYAND INCREASE TESTOSTRON THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS TESTOSTRON CLOMOPHINE SOMETIMES WILL GIVE YOU AT HELP SOME MEN BUT NOT ALL SO I THINK THE EXACT MECHANISM OF WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WHAT IS CHANGING I THINK EM HEU WE NEED MORE YOU KNOW MORE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE EXACT SORT OF PAP OF PHYSIOLOGY IM NR YOUW TOR NURA CHEMICALLY IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SERIOUS TRAIT OFF TO EITHER MAINTAIN GROW HAIR OR LOSE SEXUAL FUNCTION I MEAN NOT TALKD ABOUT D H T AND SOME OF THESE UM SIDE EFFECTS AVE FINASTRI DUTASTRIDE ON U PREVIOUS EPISODES AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT A CLINITION BUT MY ENCOURAGEMENT IS ALWAYS FOR PEOPLE TO APPROACH THESE DRUGS WITH WITH A REAL LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS IF NOT CAUTION UM THE POSTPHINASTRIDE CYNDRUM WAS DESCRIBED IN THESE ON LYING QUESTIONS AS SEEMINGLY PERMANENT EVEN THOUGH UM PEOPLE HAD CEASED TO TAKE FINASTRIDE OR UTASTROTE SO IN OTHER WORDS THEY WERE TAKING THE STOF THEY I NO'T KNO HOW THEY FELT WHILE THEY WERE ON IT BUT THEY STOP TAKING IT AND THE SEXUAL DISFUNCTION ISSUES U DON'T SEEM TO BE RESOLVING UAM DOES THAT MEAN THEY SHOULD GO SEE A YOU ORE ANOTHER A MAL YOU'RE ALOGIST REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHSPOE SPECIALIST YU I MEAN OFTEN TIMES THEY DO FOR YOU KNOW THESE COMPLAINTS UM YOU KNOW THEY START TO NOTICE IT WHEN THE'RE ON THE MEDICATION THAN WHEN THEY USUALLY THROUGH ON MINE RESEARCH KCON O LEARN ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL ENTITY SOMETIMES THEY DISCONTINUE NOW SOME MEN DO HAVE RESOLUTION WHEN THEY STOP BUT THERE IS THIS PERMANENCE IND SOME HANDFUL OF MEN I MEAN T THEY'VE DONE YOU  AM ARI IMAGING TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND SORT OF YO MORAN ATOMICALLY OR FUNCTIONALLY WHAT EXACTLY'S GOING ON I THINK THEY'R SO LOT OF UNKNOWNS ABOUT IT BUT IT CAN BE N A PERMANENT OR SOM SO THEY COME IN YOU KNOWHEN THEY SEE ME IN CLINIC ERECT ALL THIS FUNCTION LOW LIBIDO AND THEN WE GO DOWN ALL THE THE HOST OF TREATMENTSTHAT WE TALKED ABOUT NEVA IOATIONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT I GAIN WE HAVE RESOLUTION AND SOM BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT SEEM TREATMENT REFRACTORY YIKES THAT'S MY ONLY RESPONSE I MEAN PERMANENT EFFECTS A ON SECUAL HEALTH IN IT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN ONE'S HAIR I MEAN THIS ISQUARE YOU KNOW A IN ALL SERIOUSNESSE IT IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT A PEOPLE NEED TO THINK VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT BECAUSE IT AS I UNDERSTAND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT SOME ONE WILL HAVE POSTPINASTRIDE CYNDRUM MIGHT RIGHT  AND I DID AM A BIT OF READING ON THIS A WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AS WELL THERE ISN'T A LOT OF INFORMATION AS YOU POINT OUT AS IT'S A FAIRLY RECENT PHENOMENO AN THAT HIGHLITES A DIFFERENT ISSUE THIS MAY BE THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WHERE YOUNG MALES AR TAKING PHINASTRIDE IN DO TASTRIDE AND THAT MIGHT BE THE CAUSE OF THE POSTPHINASTRIDE CYNDRUM RIGHT I THNK YOU ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER I THESE DRUGS HAVE PROVENG TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR OLDER MEN TREATING PROSTATE ISSUES EXACTLY RIGHT SO THIS IS IT POSTPHINASTRITE CYNDRUM A I THINK A FALLSE UNDER THE CATEGORY OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT A YOU KNW A FEW YEARS AGO WE WE'LD HEAR THE SAME ABOUT A CHRONIC FATIGUE CYNDRUM EVEN FIBRO MYALDA NOT LONG AGO WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THESE OWAYS AT ALL A PSYCHOSEMATIC ISSUE NOE WED NOW CLEARLY KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR FIVE OR MILECHO BY THE WAY A BUT I CAN RECALL AT TIME NOT THAT LONG AGO WHEN PEOPLE A IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION CANLIKE AH YE THIS IONO THIS A REAL THING BUT POSTPHINASTRTE CYNDRUM SOUNDS CERTAINLY REAL FOR THE PEOPLE THERE AR SUFFERING FROM IT EXACTLY OW I GAIN WELL THE REASON IE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON THIS AS THAT A I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AND THER'RE CLEARLY A LOT OF YOUNG MALES WHO TAKE PHINASTWRTER DO TASTRIDER OR THINKING OF DOING THAT A FOR COSMATIC REASONS AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE POTENTIALLY SERUS CONSEQUENCES OW BUT YOU DID SAY EARLIER THAT IF SOME ONE HAS A PENUS YOU CAN GET IT HARD SO A SO ALL IS NOT LOST EVEN FOR THESE POSTPHINASTRIDE CENTURE INVIDU CUT  HOLDIS THAT A A YOU MENTION CLOMAPHINE AM COULD YOUEXPLAIN WHAT CLOMAPHINE IS AND WHAT IT'S USED FOR AM BECAUSE AGAIN A WE WANT THIS DISCUSSION TO BE CENTERED AROUND THE REAL SCIENCE THE REAL MEDICINE AM BUT THERE IS A GROWING KIND OF SUB COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE SAYINGOKE TESTOSTRON THERAPY CAN CAUSES THE SPERM AM SUPPRESSIVE ISSUES AND PERHAPS SOME OTHER ISSUES AM BUT DOING NOTHING MIGHT NOT BE ANOPTION FOR SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO INCREASE THERE WHATEVER LIBIDO OTHER ASPECTS OF OF AMANDROGEN FUNCTION AM AND SO THERE ARE A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TAKING CLOMAPHINE ONLY IN ORDER TO PRESUMABLY INCREASE TESTOSTROM BUT MINORCHINE IS THAT IT WOULD IMPACT THE ESTROGEN PATHWAYS WHATWHAT'S CLOMAPHINE A WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT PEOPLE USING CLOMAPHINE AM SRVOFF LABEL A SIMPLY TO INCREASE ANDROGENS SASKETCHY TO ME FOR REASONS RELATED TO CHANGES IN NURLE CIRCUITS AM BUT YOU'LL TELL US HOUTWORKS NOWE WIALL THINK YOU FOR INCLUDING THE OWFULA BELL DISCLOSURE ANY TIME I TALK ABOUT THIS I ALWAYS HAVE TO SAY SAY THAT BUT SO CLOMAPHINE AS THE SELECTS OF ESTRON RECEPTOR MODULATOR SO BASICLLY AT BLOCKS ESTROGEN AND SO FROM OUR EARLIER DISCUSSIONS OF HOW THE POTUITARY WORKS YOU KNOW THER SORT OF AN ELABORATE FEEBACKLUTE BETWEEN THE POTUITARY AND THE GONADS DEMAND THE TESTES AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU KNO EFFASTAGE ELAGES THESE GANADITROPAN STIMULATE DH TESTICLE TO MAKE SPERMON TESTOSTRON TESTOSTRONS PERFERLY CONVERTED ESTEROGEN AND THAT FEEDS BACK ON THE HYPOTHALEMUS TO STOP THAT SO GAIN YOU DON'T GET AN OVER PRODUCTION SO BY BLOCKING THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR AT THE LEVEL THE TUITERIER OF THE HYPOTHALEMUS YEU'LL STOP THAT AND SO THE IDEA BEHIND BLOCKING TAT AS THE'LL GET MORE PRODUCTION OF EFFASAGE ELATES MORE OF THESE DRIVERS SO YOU GET MORE TESTOSTRO YET HIGHER STIMULATIO N OF THE TESTACAL YOU KNW THE HOPE IS THAT FOR FERTILITY THAT SOMETIMES IT CAN IMPROVE SPIRM PRODUCTION TOO AND THERE'S SOME LIMITED ATA THAT CAN HELP BUT I THINK IT'S YOUR ALLUDING TO ITS SORT OF A WAY TAGE IS AUGMENT A BODY'S OWN PRODUCTION OF TESTOSTROM SO IT CERTAINLY DOES THAT I THINK THEREIS NO QUESTION THAT TESTOSTIAN LEVELS DO RISE I THINK THAT THE REASON THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HELP IS BECAUSE NOT EVERY PROBLEM IS SOLVED BY TESTOSTRON LE CANT A TALKED ABOUT SOMEONE IN THIS O THIS DISCUSSION BUT ALSO THAT YOU  UGENEED SOME ESTEROGENIC SIGNALING AS WELL AND SO BY BLOCKING THAT YOU KW EVEN PARTIALLY COERT ALSO SOME PARTIAL AGONISTS EFFECTS OF A CLOMOPHINE AS WELL IT MAY LIMIT IT AND YOU KNOW TURNS OUT THAT ESTRGENT SIGLIS IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF THINGS IS PORTANT FOR YOU KNOW BONE HEALTH BUT SEXUAL HEALTH TOO ITS IMPORTANT FOR LOBIDO SO THAT MAY BE PARTIALLY BLUNTING SOME OF THE HOPE FOR BENEFITS OF TESTOSTR I'VE FOUND THAT MEN TEND TO BE HAPPIER ON TESTOSTROM THAN SOME OF THESE OTHER FORMS AND THAT COULD BE A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION BUT ONE OF THE ADVANTAGE OF CLULMOPHINE IF WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS IS A TREATMENT FOR LOW TESTOSTROM HYPROGANATISM IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME TOXIC EFFECTS ON SPERM PRODUCTIOM  SO BY MAINTAINING THE BODY'S OWN PRODUCTION OF TESTOSTROM BY MAINTAINING PRODUCTION OF EFFIS AGE LLAGE WILL CONTINUE TO GET SPERM PRODUCTION SO FOR THIS REPRODUCTIVE AGED MAN THAT HAS LOW TESTOSTRO AND SYMPTOMATICAL O TESTOSTROM YOU KNO LOW TO LEAN A LOW ENERGY LEVEL SEXTRA MOOD SLEEP PROBLEMS I CAN BE A WORTH WHILE TREATMENT AND IT IT DOES HELP A LOT OF MEN A BUT NOT EVERYBODY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS WHY IF THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE SPERM PRODUCTION THAT THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT IS H SEG HUMAN CORIONIC GANADATROPEN BECAUSE AS YOU MENTION EARLYAR LUDINIZING HARMON AND EFFISAGE FOLICAL STIMULATING HARMON A ARE DEPLOYED FROM THE PATUITARY AND TRAVEL TO THE TESTES WHERE THEY STIMULATE A TESTOSTERON PRODUCTION AND SPERN PRODUCTION BUT IS THE EFFISATE SPECIFICALLY THAT ENCOURAGES SPERM PRODUCTION SO WHY WOULDN'T A A MAN WHOSE TAKING MAYBE'ST A SACTEROM THERAPY OR WHO PERHAPS JUST ONCE INCREASED SPERM COUNTING QUALITY TAKE EFASH INSTEAD OF HUMAN CORYONIC AT ATROP AN WHICH IS MORE OR LESS A PROXY FOR LUTINIZING HORMO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND SO WHAT EFISTAGE DOES LAKE HE SAID AS STIMULATES SPERM PRODUCTION SO IT SEEMS LIKE COUL BE A MUCH MORE LOGICAL TREETMENT AND ACTUALLY AND RANOMIZE WILL SEBO CONTROL TRIALS IT DOES DO THAT SO ONE O THE RAS NOT IT DOES DO THAT OEL SO IT'S BENEFICIAL AND WE SHOULD WE SHOULD GIVE IT MORE BUT ONE OF THE REASON THAT WE DON'T IS COST SO IT'S RARELY COVERED BY INSURANCE AND  C G A MONTH OF THAT IS IN A HUNDRED O DOLLARS SO LET'S SAY LIKE THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT A MONTH A SORT OF THERAPUTIC EPISTAGE US PROBABLY TWO TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THAT COST IS REALLY LIMITING IT TAKES TWO TO THEE MONTHS TO MAKE A SPERM SO A YOU KNOW MEN OFTEN HAVE TO BE WOULD HAVE TO BE HONRED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BUT THERE IS REASONABLE DATA THAT WOULD HELP AND IT DOES MAKE YOU KNOW LOT MORE SENSE THAT THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN AS AGUVANT THERBE WITH TESTANSTRAN RATHERN G G A BUT  G  DOES WORK YOU KNOW SORT OF EVERYONE'S SURPRISE IT DOES ACTUALLY HELP A BUTY I AGREE THERE IS SORT OF A CONTRADICTION THERE SO IF THE PRICE CAME DOWN IT DOESN'T BE NO THIS ANOTHER AWFULLYABLE MEDICATION O FOR THAT INDICATION A IT WOULD BE IT IT COULD BE WORTH WHILE ONE HORMAN THAT WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IS PROLACTIN AI'M FAMILIAR WITH PROLACTUM FROM A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES BUT A IWAYS THINK OF A DOPAMEAN AND PROLACTIN IS KIND OF A C SAW RELATIONSHIP DOPE MEANS UP PROLACTINIS DOWN YOU KNOW DON'T ME IS ELEVATED WITH SECTURAL DESIRE SECTRAL ACTIVITY PUST EJACULATION PROLACTING GOES UP SETS PERHAPS THE REFRACTORY PERIOD ON ERECTION EJACULATION FOR SOME PURIODF TIME THEN DOPENY COMES BACK UP BUT YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF THING AND I REALIZE THAT'S FAR TO SIMPLISTIC THAT PROLACTIN IS DOING MANY THINGS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY BESIDES THAT BUT HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE HYPEROPROLACTINMIAS AM IDON'T OF PLURAL PROLEMIAS IS A A IS CLINICALLY CORRECT BUT A ELEVATED LEVELS O ROLACTIN THAT ARE COUSING PROBLEMS A FOR MEN AM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TELL TELL SIGNS OF THAT A AND THIS I'D LIKE TO USE AS A SEGWAY TO TALKING ABOUT A SOME TISEXUAL DISFUNCTION THAT IS COMMONLY DISCUSSED AROUND THE USE OF ESCESS ORIZE AND OTHER OTHER DRUGS TO TREAT DEPRESSION AND AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT SOMETIMES CREATE A ENDICRIN AND OR SEXUAL HEALTH ISSUES YES SO PROLACTIN AM IS SOMETIMES WE ITS I DIAGNOS IS HYEROPLECNEMIAS O DIAGNOSS MAKE NOT BAT MANY TIMES I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS THAT WE SEE WILL END OF HAVING THAT BUT USUALLY IT'S A HANDFUL OF TIMES A YEAR CAUSE YOU KNOW WE WE SEE A LOT OF PATIENCS AM TYPICALLY THAT TO TELL TELLS SORT OF SYMPTOMS WOULD BE UNO ONES OF LOW TESTOSTRONE THAT'S A COMMON ONE BUT YOU KNW IN MY PRACTICE I SEE IT A LOT WITH NO VERY LOW SPERM PRODUCTION SO I'VE DIAGNOS SEVERAL PROLACTINS CREETING TUMORS AND THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT WAS AN THET WARN'T GETTING PRIGNENT WE CHECK A SPIRM COUNT WAS VERY LOW YOU KNOW THAT MANDADES A CHECK OF TESTOSRON WHICH IS ALSO VERY LOW AND THEN THAT LEADS TO A POLACT IN WHICH IS VERY HIGH AND THEN THAT THAT WAS DIAGNOS SO IT'S SOMETHING I THINK TO BE AWARE OF BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT USUALLY A LOT OF SYMPSOMS AND SORTY GOING TO A CLINITION WHEN YOURE HAVING SEXUAL DISFUNCTION SYMPTOMS LOTESTOSTRONE OR FRTILITY PROBLEMS WILL USUALLY YO KNOW BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSITIV ITS PRESENT ARE THERE ANY OTHER HORMONES IN THE AM IN THE GALAXY OF SEXUAL HEALTH RELATED HORMONES THAT A FALL INTO A OU KNOW COMMON CLINICAL PRACTICE A FREE A I CHECK ESCERGON AS WELL SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ONE IS AGAIN BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OBISITY I THINK THAT CAN BE IMPORTANT SOMETIMES THERE'S TOO MUCH OROMADIZATIEN AND SO SOMETIMES A THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM I THINK YOU JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT NORMAL ESTERTON SIGNALY'S IMPORTANT I THINK TOO MUCH CAN BE BAD SO THERE ARE SOME MEN WILL REDUSEE MANIFESTATIONS AT TI CA MANIFEST AS GANICOMACITY IN SOME CASES MAIL BREST TISSUE MIL BREAST TISSUE YO AS I WAS AM TOLD A WAS AT THAT THE A MAIL BREAST TISSUE AS SORT OF LIKE E THE APPENDIX IT'S THERE BUT IT'S NOT VERY INTERESTING WRIT'S WRIGHT YET EVERYBODY HAS SOME AND WE JUST DON'T WANT THE GROWTH TO GET OUT O CONTROL COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCE WORDS WHICH IS VERICASIL IS YES SO VERICASILL IT'S A VERY COMMON CONDITION WHY ABOUT FIFTEE PER CENT OF ALL MEN HAVE IT AND IT'S A VERY COMMON CAUSE OF IN FERTILITY YOU LOOK IT ALL THE EDIOLOGIES IT CAN BE THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT SO BASICA WHAT I IS AS DILATED VEINS IN THE SCROTUM IM SOBVOUS TY WE NEED VEINS TO GET BLOOD OUT OF THE TESTACLES I UT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE A LITTLE LARGER THAN AVERAGE AND THERES S SORT OF E NORMAL FOR THE THURMAL REGULATIONS OF THE VEINS A GET TOO BIG ETS THOUGHT TO WARM UP THE TESTACLE THE OTHER THOUGHT IS THAT IT DOESN'T ADEQUATELY CLEAR SOME OF THE METABELITES IM SO EXACTLY THE PATHO PHYSIOLOGIES YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT DEBATED BUT I THINK THOSE PROBY CONTRIBUTE IM AND IT SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR IF YOU'R CONCERNED ABOUT FERTLITY IM SO AGAIN WE SEE IT VERY COMMONLY YOU KNOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT A LOT OF MEN HABIT ABOUT ONE AND SEVEN MEN HAVE IT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS CAUSE A PROB IT MAY BE ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TIME IT DOES SO MEN'LL MANIFEST WITH LOW SPIRM COUNTS WE SEE SOMETIMES DISCOMFORT YOU KNOW ACHE YOU WORSETO THE END O THE DAY THAN THE BEGINNING OR TOT ACTIVITY ANY TIME BLOOD CAN POOL SOMETIMES IT STRETCHES IN SOME MEN FEEL THAT AND THEN IT KIDS SOMETIMES IT CAN LEAD TO UE EITHER STUNTED TESTICULAR GROWTH OR SHRINKAGE OF THE TESTACLE M IT'S ALSO THOUGHT TO BE A PROGRESSIVE LEGION TO THE LONGER MAN HAS IT THE MORE DAMAGE IT CAN DO USUALLY MANIFEST AROUND PUBERTY IN GENERAL IM SO IT'S NOT A CONCERN FOR EVERYBODY BUT I THINK CERTAINLY OF COUPLES OR HAVING DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVING HAVING DISCOMFORT IN THE AREA AND YOU HAVE ONE IT'S THE DISCUSSION YOU SHOULD HAVE ABOUT PERONIOS DISEASE YES A PERONIES IS A SCARRING OF THE PENUS WHICH LEADS TO CURVETURE OR DEFORMITY SO THE WAY ERECTION'S WORK IS EVERYTHING SWELLS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE TAT THERE'S A SCAR TISSUE IT DOESN'T SWELL SYMMETRICALLY SO YOU GET LIKE A CURVATURE DEVIATION SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET AN HOUR GLASS OR SORT OF A BANDING IM YOU LOOK IT UP ON THE INTER NAW YOU CAN SEE A HOST OF DIFER M DEFORMITIES THAT MEN YET IT PRIVE PRESENT ABOUT FIVE TEN PERCENT OF MEN SO IT'S VERY COMMON UM SOMETIMES IT CULD BE FROM INJURY YOU KNOW FROM O A LIKE A PENA FRACTURE OR OTHER BE KNO SORT OF LESS SEVERE FORM OF INJURY TO THE PENUS SOMETIMES MEN HAVE DESCRIBED HITTING IT ON DIFFERENT THINGS POTENTIALY THAT CULD COULD LEAD TO IT I SOMETIMES IT CAN MANIFEST AFTER AM A PROSTAC CANS OR SURGERY OR OTHER KIND OF SURGERIES WHICH CAN YOU KNOW FOR TO STUN THE PENUS OR O INJURE SOME OF THE NERVES OF THE PENUS M SO THAT'S ANT OTHER CONDITION WE SEE COMMONLY M OU KNOW OBVIOUSLY CAN LEAD TO BOTHER YOU KNOW IN ERECTIONS ARE NOT STRAIGHT THAT CAN JUST YO KNOW CAUSE A YOU KNOW PSYCHOLOGIC BOTHER TO MEN CAN ALSO PHYSICALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR A MAN TO HAVE SEX YOU KNOW M SOMETIMES IT CAN LIMIT CERTAIN POSITIONS THAT'S ANOTHER COMMON COMPLAIN WE SEE U I THINK IT SOMETHING THAT MEN SHOULD BE AWARE OF THERE'S NOW WERING IS CAMPAIGNS NOW ATHERE'S AN EFTY IPPROVED MEDICINE FOR IT A COLAGENASORS IAFLEXS WHICH IS A MEDICINE THAT'S ALL SCAR TISSUE UM SO THAT'S ONE OF THE TREATMENTS WE HAVE FOR IT THERE'S ALSO YOU KOW DIFFERENT DEVICES SORT OF STRETCHING DEVICES OR WE TRYING JUST MECHANICALLY REMODEL THE PENUS TO ALLOW IT TO BE A LITTLE BUT STRAIGHTOR U AND THEN THERE'S ALSO SURGICAL OPTIONS TO SO THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO ALWAYS TELL MEN AGAIN SLONG THAT PENUS WE CAN MAKE IT WE CAN MAKE HARD BUT WE CAN ALSO MAKE IT STRAIGHT I'M WONDERING WHY IN THE STUDY ABOUT PENUS LENGTH A TESTICULAR SIZE AND VOLUME WASN'T ALSO MEASURED AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING HAT WE HAVEN'T DISGUST UM WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TESTICULAR SIZE AND VOLUME UM AND SOME OF THE OTHER PERAMETERS WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND MAYBE THIS IS ALSO A GOOD TIME TO HIGHLIGHT UM ANY KIND OF UM MOREPHOLOGICAL SIGNALS THAT A WOULD WARRANT PEOPLE COMING TO THE CLINIC SO A SYMMETRY IN TESTICAL SIZE FOR INSTANCE A CHANGES IN TESTICULAR SIZE EM OBVIOUSLY A PESIZE LUMP A THEY TAUGHT US IN A HIGH SCHOOL ESS A A WARNING SIGN OF POTENTIAL TESTICULAR TUMOR OR CANCER A YO WE YOU REALLY TALK ABOUT TESTACALS YES SO I THINK THAT YET KIND BEING AWARE YOU NW THE AVERAGE SIZE OF M A TESTACAL FOR MAN IS ABOUTS YOU KNOW FOR ABOUT A WALNOT SUTS ABOUT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY C CEAS IM HE USED IF YOU ARE GET A MEASURE AT IT BE ABOUT FOR O BORN A HALF CANTIMETERS AND LONGEST AXIS TO GIVE YOU KNOW YOUR LISTENERS OR VIOURS AT SOME IDEA I IF IT CHANGES CERTAINLY LET PEOPLE KNOW IF YOU FEEL ANYTHING LET PEOPLE KNOW ALTHOUGH AM ARE OU KNOW NATIONAL GUIDE LINES ON SCREENING PRACTICES RECOMMENDS AGAINST REGULAR TESTICULAR SELF EXAMINS INTERESTINGLY BECAUSE I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT IT LEADS TO MORE ANXIETY THAN CANCERS THAT IT WOULD DIAGNOS BUT I THINK YOU N OWWAYS TELL MEN NO ONE KNOWS YOUS RODIN BETTER THAN USE OF YOU IDENTIFY YOU KNOW PROBLEM YOU SHOULD BRING IT TO ATTENTION SO YOU NOW THE CLASTIC APPEARANCE OR THE WAY THAT TEST TIS CANTERA MANIFESTIS OF FIRM PAINLESS MASS THAT YOU COND OF FEEL COMING FROM THE TESTACAL AM  FINDY INTERESTING THAT AM AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND WOMEN ARE ENCOURAGED TO DO REGULAR SELF EXAMS OF THEIR BREASTS FOR FOR LUMPS O BUT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT MEN ARE ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE FROM DOING REGULAR EXAMS OF THEIR TESTACLES FOR LUMPS THAT COULD BECANCER AT FEELS LIKE A M UNFAIR A SYMMETRY IT TELL AS I'VE BEEN CANCER I MEAN BOTH BOTH SEEM VERY IMPORTANT  OH YET YOU I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION I WAS STEUN VERY BY US YE I WOAS TRYING TO SAY IT'S SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OH YET YE ONTO GET YTROUBLE WIT YOU L AS A IS I  AAT ANY ONE TO GET CANCER I MEA NOT SO AM I YOU WANT A DOG TO GET CANCER AM SO I'M SURPRISED THAT THEY DISCOURAGE SELF EXM AM BUT IS IT BECAUSE MEN ARE GETTING IT WRONG THEY'RE COMING INTO THE CLINIC THINKING THEY HAVE TESTICULAR CANCER AND THEN MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T I THINK THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF CANCERS THT OR DIAGNOSPERSES HE FALSE YOU KNOW M THE FALSE YOU KNOW LUMPS AT THEY IDENTI I JUST LEAD TO MORE ANXIETY AND I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY YOUA CAUSING MORE HARM THAN GOOD I THINK IT'S THE CONCERN BUT AM YET IT WAS A SURPRISING RECOMMENDATION WHEN IT CAME DOWN USUALL PATIENCE ASKD ABOUT IT I CERTAINLY DON'T DISCOURAGE THEM FROM DOING THESE EXAMS AND I HAVE WE CERTAINLY IDENTIFIED CANCERS THROUGH THAT MEANS BEFORE I SAW THE EPISODE OF YARE WHERE THE GOD WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING WHEN HE WAS AN ELETE RUNNER AND TURNED OUT HE HAD TESTICULAR CANCER AND HE HAD OVERLOOKED THE LUMP ON HIS TESTIC ALSO AMENA CONTINUED HISELF SCREEN BERNOU NUMEROUS TIMES SAY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF GETTING A BLOOD TEST FOR HORMON PROFYLES LIPPID PROFYLES AND OTHER THINGS AS WELL AS A SPERM ANALYSIS UM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ONE CAN ONLY DO THAT IF THEY HAVE THE DISPOSABLE INCOME TO ELECT TO DO THAT THROUGH SOME COMMERCIAL ON LINE SERVICE U BUT IS THERE ANY WAY THAT AM PATIENCE WHO HAVE INSURANCE CAN A APPROACH THEIR PHYSICIAN IN A WAY THAT THIS WOULD BE COVERED BY INSURANCE UM I DON'T WANT TO GET YOU INTO ANY TROUBLE HERE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S ALWAYS SUCH A SHAME IT IS SUCH A SHAME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY AM PERVASIVELY RELATED TO HEALTH AS IS SEXUAL HEAL THROUGH PRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF A POPOTENTIAL PROBLEM IN THE PRESENTER IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MITIGATED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET A BLOOD TEST WE'RE DO SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A A ASPERMANALYSIS UM SO WE CAN'T BE A PRESUMPTUOUS IN SANGOO YOU TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS OR A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A BIG DEAL OF ME FOR LOPEOPLE THAT'S A HUGE STEAL AM IT'S PROHIBITIVE U FOR MANY PEOPLE SO HOW CAN PEOPLE GET THE STUFF ASEST UM SHOULD THEY TALK TO THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SHOULD THEY UM CALL IT YEUROLOGIST WHAT'S THE BEST APPROACH I THINK BOTH ARE GOOD STRATEGIES I THINK YOU KNOW INSURANCE IS BECOMING A LOT MORE OPEN TO COVERING OM IN PRETILITY AT LEAST TESTING SOMETIMES TREATMENT AS WELL SO I THINK A LOT OF INTURANCE TAS COVERED THAT NOW YAN SOMETIMES WE CHECK AMEN AND ALICIES FOR OTHER JACE ORY ISSUES UM BUT I THINK THAT YOUL GET AS MORE OF THIS DATE IT GETS OUT I THINK IT'S MORE RECOGNITION HOW IMPORTANT THE MALE IS I THINK WE'LL GET IM SORT OF MORE BYING AND COVERAGE IBVIOUSLY WOMEN HAVE YOU KNOW THE AUTOMATIC FEEDBACK OF O'BBE TORY CYCLE TO THEY KIND OF NOW AND THERE'S A PROBLEM THEY CAN BRING THAT TO THE ATTENTION BUT MEN DON'T HAVE THAT FEEDBACK WITHOUT SOME OF THES TESTING YET WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THIS EARLIOR SO FORGIVE ME A A THIS WAS ON ME TO MENTION THAT I WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SPERM QUALIUME WE SORT OF SHIFTED BACK AND FORTH TO SEAMEN QUALITY IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE UM NORMOL SEAMEN VOLUME AND HAVE VERY LOW SPIRM COUNT RIGHT HE WE'RE NOT TALKING BOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EJACULATE PERSEL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DENSITY OF FORWARDLY MOTILE HEALTHY NON DIANA FRAGMENT IT SPIRM IN THAT SEAMEN RIGHT SO IN OTHER WORDS IT'S NOT SUFFICIENG TO JUST UM ASSUME BECAUSE A YOU CAN EJACULATE THAT YOUR SPERM ER HEALTHY THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT YOT I MANE I THINK YOU KNW ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF MEN HAVE LOW SEAMEN QUALITY WHETHER BE CONCENTRATION MOVEMENT SHAPE BOUT ONE PER CENT OF MEN HAVE NO SPERM IN THE EJACULATE AND THAT SOMETHING SOMETIMES THAT NEW IDEA ABOUT SO THE ONLY WAY DON KNOW WOULD BE T ACTUALLY TO A FORMAL TEST WELL I'M ENCOURAGING PEOPLE UM TO GET THESE PERAMETERS ASSAST AND UM IM MAKING THAT STATEMENT UM BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLEAR BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT YO'VE TOLD US TO DAY THAT SPERM QUALITY AND HORMON LEVELS ARE JUST O SO IMPORTANT I'M NOT JUST FOR SEXUAL HEALTH UM BUT FOR YOUR INARY HEALTH AND FOR REFLECTING PROSTATE HEALTH AND OTHER ASPECTS OF WHOLE BODY HEALTH AND AN I'M SEXUAL HEALTH

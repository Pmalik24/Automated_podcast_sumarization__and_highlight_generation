WHEN DAVIS TURNING HIS LIFE AROUND IN TRYING DIVEREN THINGS AND FIGRING OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT ONE PLACEAS HE LOOKED WAS TO THE HOWARD'S STERN SHOW I THINK THERE WAS A REALLY GOOD CHOYES I KNOW EVERYBODY IS NOT AFAN OF HOWARD'S STERN BUT I AM AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THE SHOW IS THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE TALK WITH THIS KIND OF BRUTAL AND FUNNY HONESTY ABOUT THEMSELVES ONE OF HOWARDS INNOVATIONS IS THAT HE TOOK THE STRAIN OF CRUDE DARK CONFESSIONAL COMEDY THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A BIG PART OF STAND UP EVER SINCE WEN HY BRUSE HOWARD FORGET OUT HE WAY TO TURN THAT INTO RADIO DAILY RADIO ANYWAY TO GET BACK TO HIS GIDAVE HE LOVED THAT ABOUT THE SHOW AND IN TWHENTY FIFTEEN HE WAS A FEW MONTHS SOBER IN HIS EARLY FORTIES WORKING AS A WAITER T CATS'S DELLY IN NEW YORK SITY WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER HE'D WORKED IN TELLIVISION POSTING AN INTERVIEW SHOW FOR COWLAGE KIDS BUT BRUINED THAT CAREER WITH A HEROINE DICTION NOW SOBER IN RECOVERY HE NEEDED A PROJECT  HE DECIDED TO A PODCAST ABOUT DRUGS WITH THE FEELING OF THE HOWARD TERN SHOW LIKE HE REMEMBERD THE YEARS WHEN COMMETTIONARTY LANGWAS ON HOWARD'S STERN DEFINITELY MY FAVORPEC HOWARD'S TERN WON AIGADY WOULD COME ON EVERY DAY HE WOULD TALK ABOUT HIS OWN DRUG PROBLEMS HE WOULD TELL CRAZY STORIES HE WOULD TALK IN THS VERY REAL WAY ABOUT THE MISTAKES HE WAS MAKING IN HIS LIFE AT THAT TIME THAT HE WAS NOT ATBLE T STOP AND DAVE WANTED TO SHOOT FOR THAT HE WOULD CALLHOST THE SHOW WITH THI FRANK CRISS TO HE HAD MET CHRIS YEARS BEFORE IN REHAVE THERE WOAD SBEENT HOWARDS IN REHAV SMOKING CIGARETTES AND TALKING ABOUT THE CRAZY THINGS O THE DONE ON DRUGS THAT'S WHAT THEY WENTED TO PODCAST TO BE PEOPLED COME ON TEL WILD DRUG STORIES AND VERY IMPORTAN TO DAVE NO RE COVERY TALK WHICH DAVE FOUND TO BE SANCTIMONIOUS AND ANNOYING THIS SHOW I'S NOT AS SOWLY ABOUT RECOVER IT'S BET DRUGS THEY BE VENTUALLY IT WILL BE WES ITS THIS SHOW IS EVER ABOUT RECOVERY YET GET SOMEBODY ELSE IN THI PUT OME O O GATIE CASES ISN'T CLEAR IN THSE RECORTINGS DAVE IS THE ONE WITH THE DEEPER VOICE IN THE LOUD OPINIONS CHRIS IS THE OTHER GOD THE SHOW IS ABOT DRUG STORY IS NOT ABOT RECOVERY IT'S NOT ABOU DOING THE NEXT RAT THING IT'S NOT THE LAST WRONG THING THE LADY WITH THE EVOLUTION OF YOU RECOVERY THAT'S WHAT THE SHOW WILL BE  NOTICE OW AT THE ENDTHER CHRIS IS NOT AGREE IN HI DAY CHRIS IS TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN DAVE BUT STARTED DRUGS IN DRINKING AT AN EARLIER AGE HE'S JUST ELEVEN OR TWELVE AND HIS WAYMORE EXSTREME STORIES ABOUT IT PUTTING A YEAR IN PRISON HIS ALSAS PENT WAY MORE TIME IN REHAB AND AT THIS POINT HE'D BEEN SOBER FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS FIRS HIS FOUR MONTHS FOR DAY AND ALL THAT GAVE HIM A DIFFERENT FEELING ABOUT RE COVERY AND SOBRIETY HE WAS CAME TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT DAVE WAS AT AM IT SO BRITY ISN'T ALL THAT ENTERTAINING AT FIRST AND FOREMOST HE WANTED THE PODCAST TO BE ENTERTAINING IT I SHOWS ABO RECOVERY SANN BEN LA SO THEY TELLD DRUG STORIES WAS MEN TO BE GOOD FOR YOU WAS MEAN TO BE FUN HEY LISTETED IN THE COMEDY SECTION OF HIG TUNES NOT SELF HELP IF HE WONCE SELF HELP DAVID SAID GO TOON MEETING IT WILL DON'T CALL THE SHOW WAR STORIES BUT THERE WAS ALREADY APODCAST CALLED WOR STORES

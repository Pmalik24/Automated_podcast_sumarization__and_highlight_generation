PRIVATE EMAL SERVER THERE'VE BEEN OTHER PEOPLE WHO IN THE PASSIVE HAD PRIVATE EMAL ADDRESSES AND IF THOSE PRIVATE EML ADDRESSES ARE DEALING WITH ENO PRIVATE BUSINESS THAT IS ONE THING BUT IF THEY ARE DEALING WITH OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND THIS IS BEING USED THE SORT OF A CHINESE FIREWALL IN ORDER TO SCREEN THOSE OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM ANY SORT OF DISCOVERY THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM TO

ORDER TO EMAL HIS SON ABOUT A CAL THT HE HAD JUST HAD WITH THE THEN AHEAD OF U KRANE THIS IS A PRETTY DICY STUFF FOR JOBIDON AND AGAIN JOBIDON HAS LONG BEEN A DEEPLY CORRUPT UMAN BINE IN JOBIDON HIS CORRUPTION GOES ALL THEWAY BACK TO HIS FIRST SENATE RACE THEIR SERIOUS ALLIGATIONS THAT HIS FIRST SENATE RACE PEOPLE RELATED TO THE BIDON CAMPAGN WORKED ALONGSIDE MEMBERSE OF LOCAL UNION TO PREVEN FOR EXAMPLE THE DESSEMINATION OF A NEWSPAPER THAT CONTAINED IN INSERT FOR HIS REPUBLICAN OPPONENT THAT THE UNION WAS BASICALLY TOLD TO CREATE A A PICKET LINE SAID THE NEWSPAPER DIDN'T GO OUT THAT DAY THUS BOOSTING JOBIDON TO HIS FIRST SENATORIAL VICTORY IN DELAWARE AND THEN FROM THEN ON IT'S BEEN UNBROKEN SERIES OF SCANDALS INVOLVING JOBIDON AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND MONEY FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE ABSOLUTLY ON CREDIT WORTHY RECEIVING MONEY FROM BANKS WHO ABSOLUY SHOULD NOT AV BEEN LENDING THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT JOBIDON WAS THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE TO HIS SONS RECEIVING JOBS THEY CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TWO HUNTER BIDON RUNNING AROUND IN FOREIGN PRECINCTS PICKING UP BADS OF CASH UNDER THE BIDON NAME BUT JOBIDON HAS ALWAYS HIT BEHIND THE SORT OF PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY I WAS NEVER DIRECTLY INVILVE THIT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY WAY SHIPPER FORM AND ITS BEEN PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO EVERYBODY T HE WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN EVERY WAY SHAPEN FORM AFTER ALL HOW DOES A MAN WHO

UMUSS JOBIDON IS ACTIVELY INTERESTED IN THEM DOING REALLY WELL BY USING HIS NAME AND HE KNOWS THAT THE'RE USING HIS NAME IN ORDER TO TRAFFIC HE KNOWS THAT BUT THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST EVIDENCE THAT JOBIDON WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED AS IN LIKE WRITING EMOS OUT WE HAVE A LOT OF INDIRECT EVIDENCE THE JOBION WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED WE HAVE A LOT OF INDIRECT EVIDENCE RANGING FROM ACTUAL TESTIMONY FROM POLIKE DOVERN ARCHER THAT HUNTER BIDON WAS HAVING JOE'S STOP BY BUSINESS MEETINGS OR THAT HUNTER WOULD ACT TOULD CALL UP JOE ON THE PHONE AND I'E TOCK BOT THE WEATHER AND THEN THEY WOULD GET OFF THE PHONE IN FRONT FOR THER PEOPLE WE WE HAVE TESTIMONY FROM TONY BOBYLENSKY THAT JOE WOULD STOP BY VARIOUS BUSINESS FUNCTIONS WE HAVE PICTURES OF JOE WITH VARIOUS BUSINESS DIGNATARIES THAT HUNTER WAS CULTIVATING AT WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT THIS WOULD BE ACTUAL COMMUNICATIONS TWO HUNTER BIDEN ABOUT THE BUSINESS WHICH WOULD BE THE FIRST THAT WE HAVE ACTIVELY SEEN AT THIS POINT IN RIDING SO BE

STUCK WHICH BRINGS US TO THE STATES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I HAVE A QUESTION WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO WIN WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO WIN YOU HAVE A CORRUPT ELDERLY MAN WHOIS NOT CAPABLE OF FULFILLING HIS OFFICE TAND WHEN HE IS CAPABLE IT'S EVEN WORSE I'D RATHER HAVE HIM BEING SEEN O WATCHING MOUTLOCK IN THE BASEMENT THEN HAVING HIM DO THE SORT OF DAMAGE HE DOES TO THE COUNTRY WHEN HE OCCASIONALLY IS AWOKAN BY AUTHORIZINE SHOT OR SOMETHING SO REPUBLICANS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF THIS GUISE TO YOU NOTE THEY SHOULD DO MAYBE THY SHOULD RUN A CANDIDATE WHO COULD WIN I DON'T KNOW IT'S SOUNDSLIKE A CRAZY IDEA I KNOW IT SOUNDS NOTS MAYBE THEY SHOULD FOCAS LAST AN PERSONALITY AND A MOTIONAL RESPONSE TWO PARETICULAR CANDIDATES AND MAYBE THY SHOULD FOCAS ON YOU KNOW WHO COULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND MAKE TROBIDI NOTBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT'S UP THERE'S VERY INTERESTING PIECE OF DATA THEN IS COMING DOWN FROM AT NATCONE THEY COME TO SOME REALLY COD DATE AND ALSIS AT THE NEAR TIMES TEVEN THEY'S AT THE MERTIMES NACONSDAY AN ALSIS S GOOD I AND OM HE BREAKS DOWN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN TOI SENTIALLY SIX PIECES FIRST IS THE SOCALLD MODERATE ESTABLISHMENT HIGHLY EDUCATED AFFLEN SOCIALLY MODERATE OR EVEN LIBERAL OOUTRIGHT NEVER TRUMP VERY OFTEN THET BE LIKE FOURTEEN PER CENT SO THE MODERATE ESTABLISHMENT WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT SAY CHRIS CHRISTY FOUR EXAMPLE MAYBE LIKE NICKY HALEY AT THE EDGE RIG THEYLYC DID THEY CAN AVE LEFT DOING O THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THEY THE ASA HUTCHENSON WING THEN THERE'S THE TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVES TWENTY SIX PER CENT OLD FASHIONED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES TO POSE ABORTION AND PREFER CORPORATE TAX CUTS TO NEW TERRIFS THEN A LOVE MISTER TRUMP BUT THEY DOE SUPPORTIN RATES SO THERE'S BE MADE MIT LIKE NEVER CAN MAYBE TRUMPERS THEN YO'VE GOT THE RIGHT WING THAT'S TWENTY SIX PER CENT THEY WATCH FOX NEWS IN NEWSMACS THEY'RE VERY CONSERVATIVE TE'R DISPROPORTIONAL EVENTELICAL THEY BELIEVE AMERICAS ON THE BRINK OF CATASTROPHE AND THEY LOVE TRUMP MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP THAT'S TWENTY SIX PER CENT THE BLUE COLLOR POPULACE THAT'S TWELVE PER CENT THEY'RE MOSTLY NORTHERN SOCIALLY MODERATE ECONOMIC POPULACE WHO HOLD DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE EWS ON RACE AND EMIGRATION TNOT ONLY DO THEY BACK MISTER TRUMP HE HIMSELF POBLY COUNTED AS ONE A DECATE AGO THAT'S TWELVE PER CENT THE BLUE COLLOR POPULACE O THEY BE LIKE JADY VANSIS CROWD THE LIBERTARIAN CONSERVATIVESTESE ARE FOURTEEN PER CENT THESE DIS PROPORTIONALLY WESTERN AND MIDWESTERN CONSERVATIVES VALUE SMALL GOVERMENT THE'RE RELATIVELY SOCIALLY MODERATE AND ISOLATIONIST TAND THERE ON THE LOWER END OF TRUMP SUPPORT COMPAREDWTH OTHER GROUPS IN N THERE'S THE NEW COMERS EIGHT PER CENT THEY DN'T LOOK LIKE REPUBLICANS THEIR YOUNG DIVERS AND MODERATE BUT THESE DISAFFECTIVE VOTERS LIKE DEMOCRATS AND THE WOKE LEFT EVEN LESS O CASE SO IF YOU' ENUT BREAK THIS TOWN WHEE YOU OULD FIGURE IS THAT TRUMP HAS ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT PER CENDS OF THE REPUBLICAN VOTE ABSOLUTELY LOCKED UP RIT'S A TAT MEANS ALMOST FORTY PER CENT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS BASICALLY LOCKED UP WHAT HE SAYS THAT THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN BLUE COLLOR POPULICE AND THE RIGHT WING HAS LEFT MISTER TRUMPS TETENTIAL O PONENT OPPOSITIENT IN DISARRAY THE FORE TRUMP THE PARTY'S MAIN STREAM PREVAILED AGAINST RITWIN CANDIDATES BY UNITING TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVES AND THE MODERATE FACTIONS BOTH ESTABLISHMENT AND BLUE COLLOR THAT BLUE PRIN FOR VICTORY APPEARS TO BE CLOSED AT LEAST FOR NOW WITHOUT A NATURAL FACTIONAL BASE RONTO SANTUS IS STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN A STEADY FOOTHOLDS IN THE RACE IN FACT TRUMP LEADS TO SANTUSAMONG EVERY GROUP OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS THE REST OF THE PARTY BEYON TRUMPS PASE MAY NOT ALWAYS BACK TRUMPS POLICIES BUT'S NOT NECESSARILY ANTI TRUMP THE CLOSEST THING TO AN ANTI TRUMP GROUP INTHE PARTY THE MODERAISTABLISHMENT HAS BECOME ALIENATED FROM THE REST OF THE PARTY SO YOW AGAIN THAT BREAK DOWN BRIAKS  VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN FOR ANY ONE WHO WISHES TO CHALLENGE PRESIDENT TRUMP WHELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU ARE A IF YOU ARE A CANDIDATE WHO WISHES TO CHALLENGE PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE'S REALLY ONLY TWO BASEES TO DO SO ONE IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AS PRESIDENT DIDN'T DO ENOUGH THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AS PRESIDENT HIS RECORD THE FIRST THREE YEARS WAS GREAT BUT IN THE LAST YEAR HE SFOR FELLOPART AND ALSO YO BECAUSE OF THAT HE DIDN'T WIN THE LAST ELECTION THAT'S POINT NUMBER ONE AND THERE'S LOT OF TRUTH TO THAT THE LAST YEAR OF JUM OF OF DON TRUMPS PRESIDENCE HE WAS NOT GOOD HIS IS HANDLIG OF COVET WAS NOT GOOD IS HANDLING OF THE RACE RIOTS OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS NOT GOOD ALL OF THAT CAN BE TRUMP AND THEN THERE'S THE SECOND POINTAN THIS S THE REALLY MORE TELLING ONE WHICH IS DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE AN EXCELLENT SHOT AT BEATING JOBIDON THE POLLING THAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW THAT I SHOWING HIM COMPETITIVE WITH JOBIDAN VERY OFTEN IS INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY BIAS PULLING YERE'STHAT THE'S A PULICAME OUT YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT SHOWED THE HE AND JOBIDON WERE EFFECTIVELY TIED IN THE RACE IT THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM IT THAT POLE IT SHOWS JOBIDEON WINNING MINORITY VOTERS BY PLUSS TWELV JOBINAN IS NOT GOING TO IN MYNORITY VOTERS BY PLUS TWELVES AN WHEN MINORITY VOTERS BY LIKE THIRTY THIRTY TO FORTY POINTS BECAUSE THTS FOR DEMOCRATS ALWAYS WIN BY THERE'S BEEN SOME MOVEMENT AT THE EDGES BUT NOT TO THE TUNE OF LIKE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PER CENT THIS A NOTION THAT TRUMP IS GONT OT ONLY LOSE BY TWELVE POINTS AMONG MY NORITY VOTERS BROAD RED LIKE BLACK HAS PANIC AN ASION VOTERS HIS TOTALLY WHILE BUT THOSE POLES ARE FLOATING TRUMPRIGHT NOW BECAUS AGAIN IF THE ELECTABILITY ARGUMENT IS THE CHIEF ARGUMENT THAN THE POLES THAT SHOW THAT TRUMP IS STILL ELECTABLE AGAINST JOBIDON ARE REALLY REALLY HELPING HIM OBVIOUSLY AND THAT'S ABOUT JOBIDON'S WEAKNESS BUT PEOPLE NEED TO ASK THEMSELVES OT THIS POINT WHAT IS TRUMP KON RUN IS CAMPAIGN ON GOING FORWARD THISN'T ABOUT TO SANTIS THIS NOW ABOUT TRUMP YOU ONTO MAKE THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT TRUMP THAN THE CAMPAIGNS BUT TRUMP CAN TRUMP WIN SHOULD BE THE ARGUMENT THE REPUBLICANS ARE

I'VE MADE THAT INCREDIBLY CLEAR OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEVE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS I THINK THE CASE IN MANHADDON IS B S LIKE OVERT B S I THINK THAT THE JANUARY SIX CASE BEING BROUHT BY JACKSMITH IN D C IS A MISCHARGE I THIN THE CASE BEING BROUGHT BY FANNY WILLIS THIS REGO CASE IS 'N OVER CHARGE AND IS A MIS USE OF RECO LIKELY BECAUS SHE DOESN'T ATURALLY HAVE A CRIMINAL ENTERPRIZE AND I THINK THAT

FOUR BE ABOUT LITIGATION AS OPPOSED TO YOU NO ELECTIONS I DON'T UNDERSTAND MY INTEREST AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN IS PRIMARILY IN JO BI NOPING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES RUNNING OF THE DO J VEAMERIC GARLAND THAT IS PREDOMINENTLY MY INTEREST I CERTAINLY HAV AN INTEREST IN DONALD TRUMP FIGHTING HIS LEGAL BATTLES THATS THAT'S FINE IS THAT MY PRIMARY INTEREST AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO BASE TAXES IS

ABOUT FUNDING DONALD TRUMP'S LEGAL TRUBLES BY THE WAY IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT HE'S FUNDING ANYBODY ELSE IS LEGAL TROUBLES HE'S GOT A BUNCH OF LAWYERS WHO'RE VERY LOYAL TO HIM AND THE MINUTE THAT THEY SAID

BILLYAN DOLLARS WHY IS HE USING HIS CAMPAIGN FUNS TO FUN HIS LEGAL PROBLEMS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION WHY I MEAN SHOULD' HE BE USING HIM TO BEAT JOBIDEN FORGET ABOUT THE IDEA THAT HIS HIS OWN SUPPORTERS ARE ARE REALLY HOPING HE'LL USE THE FUNDING NOT FOR HIS LEGAL FUNDING BUT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE ISN'T THERE A TACIT ADMISSION THERE THAT EITHER HE'S NOT WORTH AS MUCH MONEY AS HE SAYS HE IS OR THAT HE'D RATHER USED YOUR MONEY TO FUN HIS LEGAL BILLS AN HIS OWN MONEY TO FUN IS LEGAL BILTS THAT WHY IS HIS MUT WHY IS HIS MONEY NOT BEING USED FOR HIS OWN LEGAL PROBMS AND FOR TH LEGAL PROMIS OF HIS ALLIES BY THE WAY IN SPEAKING OF HIS CAMPAIGN MEAN THRE'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY FRUM POLITICOT TODAY OKAN THIS IS STORY TALKING ABOUT LOR LUMER SO LOR LUMER IS APPARENTLY VERY OPSETIMEN BECAUS I MENTIONED IT THAT SHE'S A KIND OF A CRAZY PERSON AND THE DONAL TRUMP IS ALLIED WITH HER SHE'S KIND OF A CRAZY PERSON DONAL TRUMP IS ALLIED WITH HER THAT'S JUST WHAT THAT IS WHAT IT IS IN ANY CASE ACCORDING TO POLITICO RON PHILIP COWSKY WHO IS A FAR LEFT TWITTER ATTICT HE HAS TEEMED UP NOW WITH LORA LUMER AND PEOPLE OF FILIATED WITH DONAL TRUMPS CAMPAIGN TO A TACK RONASANTIS SO JUST TO GET THIS STRAIGHT THE WAY THAT WORKS IN PUBLICAN PARTY POLITICS IF YOU SAVE ONE BAD WORD ABOUT DONAL TRUMP AND YOU ARE ANOTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE REPUBLICANS ARE ANGRY AT YOU IF DON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN TEEMS UP WITH RON PHILIP COWSKY TO ATTACK RONTO SANTUS THAT'S GOOD APPARENTLY APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO POLITICO PHILIP KOWSKY SEN IM PROBABLY THE TOP ANTAD TO SANTAD PERSON ON TWITT ON TWITTER SO FRIVALS HAVE SOMEPHING ANTAD T SANTUS THAT ONE T GET INSTO THE MAIN STREIM THEYLL SEND IT TO ME THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DECLINED TO COMMENT AND WHETHER THEY ARE CO ORDINATING WITH A FAR LEFT TIS RON PHILLIP COWSKY TO ATTACK TO

LUMER TO ATTACK RON DESENT DOESTHIS SOUND LIKE A WAY TO BE TRUBI JUST A QUESTION BY THE WAY THE SANTS AS NOW BEEN TARGED BY MORE NEGATIVE EXPENDITURES THAN BOTH BIDEN AND TRUMP COMBINED A QUARTER OF ALL INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION CYCLE ACCORDING TO WASHINGTON EXAMINER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS HAVE TARGETED TO SANTUS STRUMP WAS IT WIT JUST EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF NEGATIVE INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES DIRECTED TOWARD HIM BIDON WAS ATTACKED OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS VINDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES SO PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY IS ATTACKING TO SANTUS AT THIS PLOINT AND KNOBODY IS ATTACKING TRUMP WEIRD WEIRD YOU KNW WELST NOBODYIS ATTACKING IS OF COURSE THE VAKE ROMASUAMIN LISSN'T I'M FRIENDS WITH THE VACE AND VAKES RELESE MARKI ALSO TE VACE SPENDS EVERY WAKING MOMEN NOT ATTACKING THE FRONT RUNNER OF HIS OWN PARTY NOT MENTIONING ANYTHING BOUT IS POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WITHTHE FRONT RUNNERO HIS OWN PARTY THE VACE IS A CLEVER GUY I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THE POLING DATA WITH REGARD TO THE VAKE IS A LITTLE BUT BIFERICATED THE ALLMINE POLES SHOM AT EIGHT NINE TEN PER CENTS AND THEN THE ACTUAL PHONE POLES THE ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE BUT MORE RELIABLE THAN ON MINE POLES HAVE LIKE TO THAT'S A PRETTY WIG GAP AND THE PRESS OR OF COURSE TRUMPING ON THE IDEA THOF VACA SURGING INTO SANTIS FLING HERE'S THE REALITY OF THE RACE THE RACES ABSOLUTELY STAGNENT I'S BEEN STAGNANT FOR THREE TO FOUR MONTHS AGAIN IF I LOOK AT THOSE REAL CER POLITICS POLLING AVERAGES I'M LOOKING AT THEM RIGHT THIS VERY INSTANT WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT DE SANTUS HAS DE CLINED ABOUT SON SOME ONE BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR PERCENT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST IDANOW EIGHT MONTHS IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLING IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT SHOWED TRUMP AT FIFTY THREE ANDT SANTUS AT NINETEEN TO DAY IN THE REAL CLAPOLLIN AVERAGE IT SHOWS TE TRUMP AT FIFTY FIVE AND SANTUS HAT FIFTEEN THAT IS NOT EXACTLY A POLING COLLAPSE TEVACE HAS BEEN SURGING TO ELEVEN PER CENT AND THE SANTIS EVEN IN THAT FOX NEWSPOLE THAT'S THE OTEN BY THE WAY THE FOX NEWS POLES THE ONLY RESINPOLE THAT SHOSAN ACTUAL OF THE VAKE SEARCH THAT'S NOT N OMLINE ONLY POLE THAT POLT THERE'S MOREIN CONSULPOLLISH WAS MAN NIDE BOTH OF THOSE POLES ALSO SHOWE TO SANTUS AT SIXTEEN PER CENT WHICH MEANS THAT HE'S BASICALLY WHER HE'S BEEN F R THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THIS RACE IS NOT CHANGE VERY MUCH R'S LILL BEN MOVEMENT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RACE NOT A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN TE REST OF THE RACE WHAT IS THAT MEAN MEANS GOING INTO TE DEBATE I WOULD A SOON THAT ALL THE ATTACKS ARE GOING TO BE ON TO SANTUS I THAT THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY THE WAY THAT'S GOING TO GO A JEFF ROW WHO OUTRUNS ONE OF THE DESSANTI SUPERPATS HE HE THEN THERE'S ONE OF THINGS THAT THE SUPERPACK SOME TIMES DO TO AVOID LEGAL COMPLICATIONS WITH CO ORDINATING WITH CAMPAIGNS STHEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO SO SOMETIMES IN LIKE DARK CORNERS OF THEINTRN AT THE POST THINGS HOPING THAT THE CAMPAGN SEES IT AND THEN IMPLEMENTS SO APPARENTLY AMEMO HAS NOW GONE OUT FRUM JEFF ROW IT DEBATE ADVISE FOR DO SANTUS FOR  NEXT WEEK TRUMP IS AREDY THAT HE'S NOT DEBATING IN FACT HE'S CN ACCOUNTER PROGRAM THE DEBATE I'M GOING TO SEE ANEN TRUMP IS A IS GOING TO DU SOME SORT OF EVENT WITH TUCKER CARLSON IT SOUNDS LIKE HE IS A FLOATING THAT HE'S SKIPPING IT BUT THE INI GOT SY THE ARANSEES ABSOLUTEL CUTLASS SEE MATE OF SUPERGUTLESS BECAUSE WHAT IS THE ARANS HE DOING HERE THE ARAN SEE IS CO ORDINATING WITH TRUMPS SUREGATES TO REPRESENT HIM IN THE SPIN ROOM SO APPARENTLY THAT MEANS THAT THEY WILL ALLOW CARRY LAKE BYRONS ONALDS AND MAD GATS AS WELL AS OTHE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS WHARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS OPENLY TO AT TEND THAT DABATE NEXT WEEK AND THEN RAND THEN BASICALLY CRITIQUE TO EBATE IN THE SPIN ROOM THAT'S WHILE THAT'S WHILE I'M SAR IF YOUR MAN DOESN'T SHOW UP YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN THE SPIN ROOM THAT'S LIKE THE SANTO SANG I'M NOT KON TO SHOW UP BUT I EM GIN A AND  CHRISTINE  SHAW OVER TO THE DEBATE ROOM TO LIKE CRITIKE ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES THAT'S THAT'S AN ABSURDITY IT REALLY IS  ONE OF THESE OTHER CANDIDATES COULD RISE BUT I'M WONDERING HOW AND 'M WONDERING AT WHAT POING THE REPUBLICANS ARE GING TO SAY YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO EXAMINED SOME OTHER OPTIONS AT THIS POINT JUST IN CASE JUSTING CASE ANYWAY THE A JEFFRO MEMO ABOUT WHATSTE SANTUS NEEDS TO DO IS QUOTE TAKE A SLEDGE HAMMER TO THE VAGE ROMASUAMMY THE POLITICAL NEW COMERISING THE PULSE HE SHOULD DEFEND DONALD TRUM AM WEN WHEN CRITZ CRISTY INEVITABLY ATTACKS THE PORN PRESIDENT AND NEEDS TO ATTACK JO BION AN THE MEDIA NO LESS THAN THREE TO FIVE TIMES NOW AGAIN WONE CAMPAIGNS ARE HAVING TROUBLE VERY OFTEN T FEELS LIKE THER JUST STUMBLING ON LANDMINE AFTER LANDMINE WHEN A CAMPAIGN IS HAVING TROUBLE AND SANSIS CAMPAIGN IS EXPERIENCING TROUBLE TO LAUNCH FOR SHORE WHEN YOU SEE THIS WHAT YOU SEE IS STUFF LIKE THIS LEEKS IN THE PRASS ABOUT DEBATE STRATEGY NOW IS THAT A TERRIBLE STRATEGY I'M I'M NOT SRURE THAT THE ISATE A TERRIBLE STRATEGY BUT THE FACT THAT IT IS NOW BEING REVEALED PUBLICLY AND AND BEING TREATED AS LIKE TOP LIE NEWS IS PART OF THE ON GOING MEDIA NARRATIVE WHICH IS THAT TE SANTIS IS GETTING HAMMERED BY TRUM HERE IS THE REALITY THE MEDIA HAVE A COMMON INTEREST IN INSURING TAT TRUMP GETS THE NOMINATION BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY THAT DONALD TRUMP GETTING THA OMINATIONAL LOOS TOBIDE THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND IF REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE IND THE NOMINATE TRUMP MAYBE HE'LL BE RIGHT AND MAYBE THE'L BE WRONG BUT IF THEY'RE RIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THET DATE THATHEYARE RIGHT AND OUT LIKE TO SEE THE PLAN THAT TRUMP PLANS TO IMPLEMENTS TO AVOID WHAT HAPPENE LAST NIMT I STIL ONE QUESTION AND ONE QUESTION ONLY GUIES IF DONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINE AND HE THINKS THAT THE LAST SELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM HIM AFTER HE WANTED BI BIG NUMBERS ACCORDING TO HIM RIGHT HE WONE HUGE WHAT IS HIS PLAN TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN DOES IT EXIST WHAT WOULD IT BE IT SEEMS TO ME THE RIGHT NOW THE R PUBLICAN PARTY IS IN ITS OWN REFRENDUM DO WE CARE MORE ABOUT DONAL TRUMP PERSONALLY OR DO WE CARE MORE ABOUT BEATING JOBIDON NOW MAYBE YOU THINK THAT YWO ARE NOT IN CONFLICT ANDTHAT'S A NICE EASY ANSWER BUT IF THE TWO ARE IN CONFLICTS WHICH ONE DO YOU PRIORITIZE AS A VOTER IS SERIOUS QUESTION FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE THE DATO SHOW THAT THE TWO RIGHT NOW ARE IN CONFLICT IN PRETEND THE DATA AWAY WE CAN ASSIN THE DATE DON'T EXIST THAT'S FINE BUT JUST AS HA HYPOTHETICAL HUMOR ME IF THE YURIN CONFLICT BEATING JOBIDON OR PERSONAL WOVE  FOR DONALD TRUMP WHICH ONE MATTERS MORE TO YOU AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ANY ONE EVEN ASKING THE QUESTION IS NOW CON SIDERED AN ENEMY OF DONAL TRUMP THIS IS NOT ME BEING AN ENEMY OF DONAL TRUMP DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE AC QUITTED ON THESE CHARGES I THINK THAT THESE CHARGES ARE BEING BROUGHT FOR POLITICAL REASONS I AGREE WITH ALL THOSE THINGS AND I WILL VOTE FOR HIM IF HE'S ANOMINA BUT IF AS THE AY TO SHOW VICTORY IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND NOMINAING DONAL TRUMP ARE IN CONFLICT WHICH ONE IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU AND IF IT IS THE LATTER I WOULD ASK WHY THEY'RE MANY WAYS TOD FENDONAL TRUMP INCLUDIN GIVING TO HIS LEGAL DEFENCE FON THAT APPARENTLY DOES NOT REALLY EXIST HE SHOULD THAT ONE UP LIKE RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE PLAN WHAT IS THE PLANT AGAN BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE THINKS TO TALK ABOUT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE INSIPIENT COLLAPSE OF THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF THE UNITED STATES WILL GET

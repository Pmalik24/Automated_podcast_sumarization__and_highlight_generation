LAST DAY PETER DESCRIBING THEIR DAD HALLUCINATING COUGHING GRUNTING LOSING CONTROL OF HIS BLATTER AND BOWELS PETER GIVING INVITEMENS AND PROBIOTICS THE COUSIN DROPPED OFF HA FINAL ROUND OF SOUP ON THE PORCH IN THE AFTERNOON SEEING HOW HER FATHER'S DEATH HAD UNFOLDED WAS AWFUL HOW HE'D SUFFERED BUT RACHEL ALSO READ THOSE TEXTS AND EVERYTHING PETER IN HER COUSIN WROTE GOING FORWARD ITH THE HELPLESS AWARENESS OF SOMEBODY WATCHING A GREEK TRAGEDY KNOWING WITH THE CHARACTERS DON'T ALL THE HORROR THAT'S TO COME IT'S LIKE THE BLACK BOX AFTER A PLANGRASH IT'S LIKE HEARING GHOSTS SPEAK OF THEMSELVES I MAN I JUST RESPODED WITH ABSOLUTE RAGE AND HEARTBREAK SHE SAW THE TEXT EXCHANGE BETWEEN HER BROTHER AND COUSIN AT THE MOMENT HER FATHER DIED PETER I BELIEVE HE'S TAKIN HIS FINAL BREATHS AND THEN A MINUTE LATER HE'S GONE COUSIN WHAT PETER WHAT PETER I SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW THIS IS WHEN RACHEL SAW HERSELF ENTER THE CONVERSATION WHEN HER BROTHER TEXTED HER THAT THEIR FATHER WAS GONE SHE SAW IN THE TEXTS HOW THE SHOCK OF THEIR FATHER'S DEATH HAD OPENED UP A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WITH PETER AND IN THAT WINDOW PETER HAD TEXTED HER AND SHE CONVINCED HIM TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL OR AS HE PUT IT IN A TEXT TO THE COUSIN RACHEL DEMANDED THAT I GO TO THE YARS I'M GOING TO THE YAR THEIRE COUSIN TEXTED BACK KEEP ME POSTED THAT WAS WHAT I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WERE DUEL CONVERSATIONS BEING HAD AND THAT ONE WAS MY AD TEMPT AT SAVING MY BROTHER'S LIFE AND THE OTHER ONE WAS MY COUSINS VERSION OF AN ATTEMPT AT SAVING MY BROTHER'S LIFE RACHEL AND PETER'S COUSIN DIDN'T RESPOND TO MY TEXTS LETTER AND PHONE MESSAGE REQUESTING AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM I'M NOT NAMING HIM BECAUSE OF THAT AND BECAUSE I DON'T WANT STRANGERS HARASSING HIM OVER THIS STORY RACHEL HASN'T SPOKEN TO HIM SINCE SHE FOUND THE TEXT BETWEEN HIM AND HER BROTHER AND HE HASIN CONTECTED HER PETER IN THESE TEXT BACK AND FORTH WITH EACH OF THEM IS CLEARLY SCARED FOR HIS LIFE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE DO IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A FUNCTIONING HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BUT IN THE UNITED STATES A LOT OF US MAY BE MOST OF US SEEK OUT ADVICE FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN THE MIDST OF HEALTH CRISIS THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY GUIDANCE IS OFTEN SUPPLEMENTED BY THE INTERNET AND THEN WERE FACED WITH THE MESSY PILE OF ANECDOTES JARGON AND SAILES PITCHES TO SIFT THROUGH THAT MESSY PILE MAY BE ALL A PERSON HAS IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR PETER DIDN'T BUT HE DID LIVE CLOSE ENOUGH TO A DECENT HOSPITAL THAT HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT IN TIME TO BE OFFERED POSSIBLY LIFE SAVING CARE AT WHICH POINT HE BEGAN TO WORRY CAN I AFFORD THIS PETER'S MIS TRUST OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM REVOLVED AROUND MONEY IN HIS TEXT WITH THIS COUSIN EVEN BEFORE HE IN HIS FATHER GOT SICK PETER KEPT RE TURNING TO THE IDEA THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THE COVI TESTS AND TREATMENTS BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE GETTING RICH FROM THEM HE BELIEVED THERE WAS A GOVERNMENT PLAN THAT GAVE HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS FINANCHELANSENTIVES TO KILL PEOPLE AND BLAME COVIT PETER WAS AFRAID OF THE WRONG THINGS WITH COVIT HE WAS JUST INCORRECT BUT THE OVER ALL IDEA THAT THE US MEDICAL SYSTEM IS SHAPED BY PROFIT SEEKING THAN HIS OFTEN AT ODDS WITH GOOD PATIENT CARE THAT'S A FACT NO ONE IN AMERICA IS WRONG TO BE AFRAID OF MEDICAL BILLS IN LIGHT OF THAT REALITY AND IN LIGHT OF PETER'S EARLIER TEXTS IT'S A SIGN OF JUST HOW SCARED HE WAS WHEN HE TEXT RACHEL FROM THE HOSPITAL AND SAYS THANKS FOR GETTING ME GOING ON THIS I WASN'T GOING TO GET ANY BETTER AT HOME AND IT WAS HARD FOR RACHEL TO ACCEPT AS SHE WAS READING THROUGH THE TEXTS THAT ONLY FORTY MINUTES AFTER HE WROTE THAT TO HER WHEN HE FINDS OUT THE HOSPITAL WILL BE GIVING HIM A NASAL SWAB PETER'S RESOLVE STARTS TO FALTER AND SO PETER TEXT THEIR COUSIN THEY PE SE ARRED ME CRINGIMOGY TOO SICK TO GET UP

CENT CHANCE IT'LL SHUT DOWN YOUR KIDNEYS SEVERAL HOURS LATER PETER TEXTS THE COUSIN THEY FINALLY BROUGHT IN A BAG OF ROM DESEVERE AND I SAID I'LL HOLD OFF ON THAT AND HE SAID O KE THAT'S FINE  NO PROBLEM WITH THE NURSE ASSISTANTS AND THE NURSE BUT SOON AS THE DOCTOR COMES AND MAKES A DECISION YOU KNOW IT'S THE ONCE THE COUSIN A MINUTE LATER NO NO NO ROOM DESEVERE PETER TEXTS TEMIPHOTO OF AN IVY BAG THE COUSIN ASKS THEY'RE GIVING IT TO YOU PETER NO I TOLD THEM ALL PASS THE COUSIN O KE I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED BUT KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE FUCKERS WHATCH EVERYTHING THEY'RE PUTTING IN THOSE LINES I'D OFFER HIM ADVISE ID SEE HIM GOTER A COUSIN TO GET LIKE THE SECOND OPINION YOU KNOW AM AND HE WOULD JUS ALWAYS DERAYALL THOSE EFFORTS IT'S JUST THE MOST UNFATHOMABLE OBSURD CONVERSATION NO WATCH HAPPEN PETER TECS THE COUSIN A PHOTO OF HIS DAD AT THAT FAMILY FUNERAL HE TOLD RACHEL ABOUT THEY'RE DAD IS HUGGING A RELATIVE WHO WAS VAXINATED AS HE'D MENTION TO RACHEL HE CAPTIONS THE PHOTO THE DAY MY DAD WAS KILLED THE NEXT MORNING PETER TETS THE COUSIN TEMP FINALLY DOWN NINETY EIGHT POINT EIGHT STILL ON OXYGEN BECAUSE MY OXYGEN LEVELS ARE WEEK THE COUSIN I'M GLAD YOUR STRUTTING TO IMPROVE THE SOONER THE BETTER THEY WON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO KILL YOU AGAIND THE COUSIN DIDN'T RESPOND TO MY INTERVIEW REQUESTS ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW ABOUT THE COUSIN THE VERY LITTLE I KNOW FROM READING THE FULL THREAD OF HIS TEXTS IS THAT HE'S A FATHER TWO OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO LIVE WITH HIM ARE IN THEIR SEVENTIES AND HE WORRIES ABOUT THEIR HEALTH HE'S A MAN WITH MULTIBLE HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES WHO IS ALSO UP LATE AND EARLY FOR WEEKS WORRYING ABOUT HIS COUSIN PETERE CHECKING ON HIM I ALSO KNOW FROM RACHEL THAT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THE COUSIN LOST ANOTHER COUSIN JENIFER WHO WAS LIKE A LITTLE SISTER TO HIM AFTER SHE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL UNEXPECTED IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE SHE WAS A YOUNGEST OF THE FOR OF US COUSINS AND HER HER BLTTER HAD BEEN NICKED DURING I SSSERIAN AND SHE ATSEPSUS AND SHE WAS YOUNG UN HAV HIS BABES AND THAN SHE DIED AND THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS CRUSHED RACHEL AND PETER TOO GENIPHER WAS THIRTY TWO YEARS OLD AND RACHEL SAYS THAT FOR PETER THIS MEDICAL ERROR WAS ONE SEERING EVENT IN A LIFETIME OF SMALLER MOMENTS THEY GRADUALLY TRANSFORMED HIM FROM SOMEONE WHO WOULD NEVER TRUSTED AUTHORITY FIGURES IN GENERAL AND DIDN'T GO TO DOCTORS HE BELIEVED HE COULD TAKE BETTER CARE OF HIMSELF WITH EXERCISE AND NUTRICION THAN SOME DOCTOR TO SOME ONE WHO SAW DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AS DANGEROUS AND LATER AS ACTIVELY SEEKING TO DECEIVE AND HARM AND EVEN KILL PEOPLE FOR THEIR OWN GAIN THE DAY BEFORE HE LEAVES THE HOSPITAL PETER TEXTS THE COUSIN THE DOCTOR FINAILY CAME DOWN AND ASKED WHY I WON'T TAKE ROM DESEVER AND HE SAID YOU'RE NOT VAXINATED AND I SAID THAT'S CORRECT HE SAID BAX THE ONLY TREATMENT WE HAVE FOR COVID AND THAT MY LUNGS ARE GOING TO DETERIORATE WITH THE OXYGEN THEY KEEP ORDERING FOR ME IF I DON'T TAKE THE REM DESEVERE I SAID I'LL THINK ABOUT IT AND HE SAID OKET AND LEFT I'M DESEVERE MIGHT HAVE REDUCED PETER'S NEED FOR OXYGEN CONCENTRATED OXYGEN CAN HARM SOME ONE'S LUNGS OVER TIME ESPECIALLY IF THEY'VE BEEN DAMAGED BY FOR INSTANCE COVID THE COUSIN TEX BACK A FEW MINUTES LATER BULK THAT ROM DESEVERE IS GOING TO DETERIORATE YOUR ORGANS ESPECIALLY YOUR KIDNEYS YOU'VE BEEN PUMPING I BE PROPHIN ALL WEEK HE'S JUST TRYING TO  SCARE YOU SO HE CAN GET HIS TWENTY PRECENT BONIS FOR USING REM DESEVERE THAT SAME DOCTOR WILL TELL YOU THE BAXENE IS GOOD FOR YOU WHICH MAKES NO SENSE CAUSE NOW THAT YOU'RE CONFIRMED THT YOU HAVE COVID AND YOURE COVERING IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'LL HAVE NATURAL IMMUNITY FOR LIFE YOU WON'T NEED BOOSTERS JUST PRAY YOUR OXYGEN LEVEL IMPROVE SO YOU CAN GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE AS RACHEL IS READING THE TEXTS SHE KEEPS GLIMPSING THESE MOVINTS HERE AND THERE OVER THE LAST WEEKS OF PETER'S LIFE WHEN PETER ACKNOWLEDGES THIS IS COVIT BUT THE IDEA OF COVID IS LIKE A BALLOON THAT CAN'T STAY ALOFT PETER TEXTS A BIT LATER ALL I HAVE TO DO IS JOG A LITTLE I'LL GET MY OXYGEN BACK UP SITTING IN A HOSPITAL BED ISN' DOING ANYTHING OXYGEN WISE THE COUSIN DO THE TERMARIC AND MENTLY LUNG INHALING EXERCISES AT HOME YE YOU'RE NOT GOIN TO CONTINUE TO DETERIORA HE'S A BUCKING LYAR A FEW MINUTES LATER RACHEL TEXT PETER AND THEY GO BACK AND FORTH ABOUT HIS OXYGEN LEVELS AND WHETHER HE HAS 'NOUGH ENERGY TO EAT AND IF HE HAS A PHONE CHARGER RACHEL ASKS HIM IF HE'S HEARD AND ESTIMATED TIME LINE FOR THEM TO DISCHARGE HIM PETER TEXTS THEY MADE IT SOWND LIKE SOON POSSIBLY TODAY OR TOMORROW RACHEL HOLY SHIT O KAY I'VE TALKED TO RACHEL A BUNCH OF TIMES AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO LET UNTRUE THINGS SLYE SHE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE IT BUT IN HER TEX WITH PETER I CAN SEE HER TRYING HARD TO BE CAREFUL WITH HIM TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIM SUPPORT HIM TELL HIM WHAT SHE THINKS HIS IMPORTANT IN HER BIG SISTER WAY BUT NOT ARGUE WITH HIM THIS DELIBERATE WITH HOLDING OF HER FOLD FORCEFULNESS IS PART OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP RACHEL FEELING PROTECTIVE OF PETER IS BUILT INTO HER EARLIEST MEMORIES HE'S BEEN PHYSICALLY BIGGER SINCE HE WAS FIFTEEN BUT SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN TOUGHER PETER LATER THAT AFTERNOON TEXTS WITH A COUSIN AND AGAIN BRINGS UP THE IDEA THAT MAYBE THIS MIGHT BE COVID PETER CAN YOU LOOK UP SAFE TREATMENTS FOR COVID THE COUSIN RITES BACK HANG IN THERE I'M CHECKING FRANTICAL LY AND THEN THE COUSIN TEXTS MONICLONAL ANNYBODIES CONVALESCENT PLASMA OR IVERMECTON THE FIRST TWO OXIONS ARE USUALLY ONLY GIVEN WHILE IN THE E ARE ONCE YOU'RE ADMITTED THE PROTOCAL CHANGES TO REMDESEVERE THEY ONLY TREAT THE BAXINATED WITH IVRE MECTON SO THAT WAY WHEN THEY RECOVER THEY CAN SAY SEE THE VAXINE KEPT YOU FROM DYING MOTHER FUCKERS THE EVIDENCE ABOUT IVRMECTON IS NOW OVERWHELMING IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE AS EITHER PROTECTION AGAINST COID OR TREATMENT OF IT AND WHILL WE'RE HERE NATURAL IMMUNITY FOR LIFE AGAINST COVID IS NOT A THING AND BAXENES DON'T CAUSE PEOPLE TO SHED THE VIRIS BUT LET'S TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT REMDESEVERE I' SPOKE WITH THE FEW DOCTORS WHO' BEEN TREATING COVID PATIENCE SENCE THE BEGINNING IN CLINEX AND HOSPITALS THEY WERE UNANIMOUS ROM DESVERE HAS REVEALED ITSELF TO BE NOT OCTUALLY A VERY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AGAINST COVIT IT ISN'T HARMFUL AND ALL THE WAYS PETER'S COUSIN KEPT SAYING IT WASED THAT WAS FROM DESEVERE'S STRENGTH IT WAS GENERALLY SAFE STUDIES DID CONFIRM IT'S MODEST USEFULNESS IN SOME PATIENTS BUT IS ONE DOCTOR PUT IT FROM DESEVERE WAS A TOL WE USED BECAUSE WE HAD SO FEW TOOLS EVEN THE DRUG COMBO RACHEL RECOMMENDED FROM DESEVEREPLUS OLLUMIANT ONE CAREFUL STUDIES SHOWED PATIENCE WHO BOUT THE COMBO WERE LESS LIKELY TO DIVE THAN THOSE WHO GOT FROM DESEVERE ALONE BUT ONLY BOUT THREE PER SENT LESS LIKELY TO DIE FOR IN ADVANCED SEVERE CASE OF COVID HERE IS NO CONSISTANT GAME CHANGER SO THE MEDICINE OF COVIT HAS BEEN GENUINELY CONFUSING WE CAN'T KNOW IF PETER WOULD HAVE SURVIVED EVEN IF HE DID STAY AT THE HOSPITAL BUT IT WAS PROBABLY HIS BEST SHOT TWO DOCTORS I SPOKE WITH TOLD ME HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS IN THEIR EXPERIENCE TO JUST LET A PATIENT TALK IF THEY WERE RELUCTANT TO GET TREATMENT FOR ANYTHING DON'T TRY TO CONVINCE THEM JUST ASK THEM HAT HAS THIS BEEN LIKE FOR YOU THEN LISTEN BUT THE DOCTORS WERE ALSO FRANKH ABOUT HOW OFTEN WITH COVIT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT CONVERSATION OR ENERGY BEFORE COVIT THEY'D SEEMED PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE AFRAID TO BE HOSPITALIZED WE DIDN'T WANT SPECIFIC TREATMENTS BUT WITH COVID THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WAREN'T JUST RELUCTANT MANYU WERE HOSTILE SOME GOT A GRESSIVE ONE DOCTOR SAID SHE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OVER AND OVER OF PATIENT SHE KNOWN FOR YEARS SEEING HER IN A MASK AND INSTANTLY DISTRUSTING HER THE DOCTORS BOTH SAID THAT SIMPLY ASKING OF A PERSON WAS VACCINATED WOULD OFTEN STOPPED THE CONVERSATION COLD AND EACH PERSONS REASONS FOR NOT WANTING A PARTICULAR COVI TREATMENT WERE BESPOKE THEIR OWN TIGHTLY HELD BUNDLE OF BELIEFS AND FEARS THAT WERE EXTRA RESISTANT CHANGE A DOCTOR MIGHT BE ABLE TO TEASE OUT AND ADDRESS THE CONTENTS OF THAT BUNDLE FAST ENOUGH TO HELP THE PERSON OR THEY MIGHT NOT ANYWAY WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME  T WHEN RACHEL STARTED READING TFORG HER BROTHER'S TEXT SHE KNEW HE HAD LEFT THE HOSPITAL AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE SHE FOUND THAT OUT FROM THE CORONER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED NOW SHE SAW PETER TEXT HIS COUSIN AT THREE THIRTY IN THE MORNING I'M STARTING TO WONDER IF THEY'RE EVERNO LET ME OUT AND MY COUSIN SAYS THEY HAVE TO RELEASE YOU UPON R QUEST MY BROTHER SAYS I SO HOPE THAT'S TRUE AND THEN MY COUSIN SEN EM DISCHARGE AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE STRAN CAP FROM VERY WELL HEALTH DOT COM THIT STATES A DISCHARGE AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE USUALLY JUST CALLED AN AMA REQUIRES TAT YOUSINAFORM AGREEING THAT YOU WISH TO LEAVE BUT THAT YOUR PHYSICIAN THINGS IT'S A BAD CLENICAL CHOICE FOR YOU TO GO IT SAYS LEGALY THEY CAN'T KEEP YOU THERE THAT'S CONSIDERED FALSE IMPRISONMENT AND MY BROTHER RESPONDS HALF AN HOUR LATER HOW SHOULD I SAY IT QUOT I NEED TO BE DISCHARGED UN QUOTE AND MY COUSIN SAYS ARE THEY CURRENTLY GIVING YOU ANY MEDICATIONS MY BROTHER NOTHING YET TO DAY ACTUALLY ALL THEY EVER GAVE ME WERE STELROYD'S AN ANABIOTICS MY COUSIN OK DO YOU HAVE AN IVE

THE HOSPITAL MY COUSIN HOW DOES YOUR CHEST FEEL PETER FEELS BETTER THAN IT DID WHEN I FIRST CAME IN WHICH IS A SIGN OF THE TREATMENT WORKING THAT LAST BART ISN'T IN THE TEXT IT WAS RACHEL VENTING HER FRUSTRATION AS SHE WAS READING THROUGH ON THIS AGAIN SHE COULD BARELY CONTAIN HERRAGE BY THE END OF THIS NEXT PART SHE WAS SNEERING MY COUSIN YAH AND THE FACT THAT GAVE YOU AN A BAOTIC THAT MANS AGAIN

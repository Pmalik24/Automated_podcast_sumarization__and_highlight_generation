ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF LIFE IS THE SIMPLE FACT IN A MATTER HOW STUPID THINGS GET REALITY ALWAYS WINS AND IN FACT RHETHER A TIME WHAT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE OR WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POLITICS RIT BROADLY THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS EVENTUALLY YOU ARE GOING TO RUN UP AGAINST REALITY AND REALITY IS GOING TO WIN SO IT COMES TO BAD POLITICAL IDEAS THAT DOISN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T EMERGE VICTORIOUS IN THE SHORT OR EVEN THE MID TERM IT DOES MEAN THAT THE REALITIES OF HUMAN NATURE THE REALITIES OF THE WORLD SURROUNDING YOU THOSE DON'T JUST GO AWAY AND EVENTUALLY THOSE POLICIES WILL FAIL DRAMATICALLY THE DUMBOR THE POLICIES THE FASTER THEY TEND TO FAIL AT O MEAN PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FAILURE TUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THEY FAIL PRETTY QUICKLY ONE OF THOSE DUMB IDEAS THAT HAS OBVIOUSLY TAKEN CENTER STAGE OF LATE HAS BEEN THE DUMB IDEA OF WOKE WOKE IS A FOOLISH IDEA NOW WHAT EXACTLY IS WOKENESS WEVE DEFIND IT BEFORE ON THE SHOW WOKENESS IS THE BASIC IDEA THAT IF THERE IS ANY SORT OF DISPARITY BETWEEN GROUP OUTCOME IN AMERICAN LIFE THAT SOMEHOW THAT GROUP DISPRITY IS DUE TO DISCRIMINATION AND THE ONLY CORRECTIVE IS THEREFORE REVERSE DISCRIMINATION SOME FORM OF DISCRIMINATION THAT IS GOING TO EQUALIZE THE OUTCOMES OF THE VARIOUS GROUPS AND WE HAVE SEEN WIDE VARIETY OF POLICIES THAT BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN ORTITO CLOTHES ALL OF THESE GAPS THE QUEST FOR COSMIC JUSTICE AS THOMAS SOAL THE GREAT THINKER OF OUR TIME HAS PUT IT IS A FOOLISH QUEST IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE SOLVED BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF GROUP GAPS ARE EITHER IN BORN OR THEY ARE THE RESULT OF CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTS ECAS THOSE ARE ALL THE FACTORS THAT THERE ARE THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY RESULT IS THE RESULT OF INBORN DIFFERENCES FOR EXAMPLE DIFFERENCE IS IN OUTCOME INTELLECTUALLY VERY OFTEN ARE ABOUT EDUCATIONAL DIFFERENCES OR CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AS SUPPOSED YOU SAY I CU BUT FOR EEMPLE HEIGHT DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN PARTICULAR GROUPS THOSE ARE ABOUT GENATICS THIS SORT OF STUFF HAPPENS THROUGHOUT LIFE AND LOOKING AT THE RATION AWLS FOR WIDE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AN FROMS OV OUTCOMES BETWEEN GROUPS IS A GOOD WAY OF CRAFT ING GOOD POLICY BUT WE'VE BASICALLY THROWN ALL OF THAT OUT IN FAVOR OF STUPIDITY AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN IN THIS STUPIDITY BUT THE PROBLEM IS AGAIN THAT STUPIDITY DOES NOT REFLECT REALITY AND WE ARE SEEING THE RESULTS OF THAT SO ACCORDING TO THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE A HAVORD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STRUGGLING TO BOOST LOW TESCORES AND DISMAL STUDENT ATTENDENTS IS SPENDING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL MONEY FOR AN ORGANIZATION CALLED WOKE KINTERGARDEN TO TRAIN TEACHERS TO CONFRONT WHITES TO PREMISY DISRUPT RACISM AND IPPRESSION AND REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS TO LEARNING HE WOKE KINTREGARDEN SESSIONS TRAIN TEACHERS ON CONCEPTS AND CORRICULA THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO USING CLASSRUMS BITH ANY OF GLASSBORK ELEMENTARIES FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOR STUDENTS THOH SESSIONS ARE FUNDED THROUGH A FEDERAL PROGRAM MEANT TO HELP THE COUNTRIES LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS BOOST STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND AGAIN THE BASIC THURY BEHIND THIS PROGRAM IS THAT IF YOU JUST TEACH KID SELF ESTEEM THEY WILL MAGUCALLY BECOMES SMARTER ANDBETTER PERFORMING IF YOU TEACH THEM ABOUT THE RATICAL INJUSTICES OF THE LIFE THEY LEAD IN THE FREEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD THAN MAGICALLY THEY WILL PER FORM BETTER ONLY ONE PROBLEM IT FAILS CAUSE REALITY ALWAYS WINDS ACCORDING AGAIN TO THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE TWO YEARS IN TO THE THREE AR CONTRACT WITH WOKE KINTERGARDEN A FOUR PROPHIT COMPANY A STUD N ACHIEVEMENT AT GLASSBROOK HAS NOW FALLEN PROMPTING SOMES TEACHERS TO QUESTION WHETHE THE MONEY WAS WELL SPENT GIVEN THE NEDS OF STUDENTS WARE PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME TWO THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS MORE THAN EIGHTY PER CENT ARE HISPANIC LATENO ENGLISH AND MATHSCORS HIT NE LOADS LAST PRING LESS THAN FOUR PER CENT OF STUDENTS WERE PROFISSIONS AN MATH JUST UNDER TWELVE PER CENT WERE PROFISSIONED AT GRAD LEVEL IN ENGLISH THAT IS TO CLIME BUT ABOUT FOUR PER CENTAGE POINTS IN EACH KATEGORY EFFORTS TO REACH THE ORGANIZATION WOKE KINTERGARDEN WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL NOW AGAIN THAT IS NOT A PARTICULAR SHOCK BECAUSE AGAIN WOKE KINTERGARDEN IS A STUPID IDEA TEACHING KIDS TERRIBLE IDEAS IS LIKELY TO MAKE THEM PERFORM WORSE NOT BETTER DISTRICTS OFFICIALS DEFENDED THE PROGRAM SAYING WOKE KINTERGARDEN DID WHAT IT WAS HIRED TO DO THAT'S TRUE THEY MADE THE SCORESE LOWER IT MADE THINGS WORSE THEY DID EXACTLY THEY ARE HIRED TO DO WHICH IS TO EXASTURBATE THE INEQUITIES THEREFORE TO CLAIM THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF IS BROKEN ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING THINGS ABOUT THE NON PROFIT WORLD THIS IS TRUE VIRTUALLY ACROSS THE BOARD IS THAT NON PROFITS ARE CONSTANTLY EXASCERBATING THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO FIGHTS THEY CAN RAISE MONEY TO FIGHT THOSE PROBLEMS THIS HAPPENS ALL OF THE TIME IN NON PROFIT LAND AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COMPANIES LIKE WOKE KINTERGARDEN IF ALL OF THE SUDDEN ACHIEVEMENT ROSE BASED ON YOU KNOW ACTURAL METRICTS OF PERFORMANCS THEY NEED FOR WOKE KINTERGARDEN WOULD DISAPPEAR SO ONE OF THEIR ACTUAL JOBS ONE OF THE JOBS OF FOR EXAMPLE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE ON THE LEFT IS TO EXASTERBATES INEQUALITIES SO AS TO CLAIM IN EQUITY THAT IS THE GOAL BECAUSE IF AT ANY POINT THOSE INEQUALITIES ACTUALLY NARROWED AS A RESULT OF FREEDOM AND GOOD IN SENSE OF STRUCTURES THAN WHAT WOULD THEY DO FOR LIVING THE DISTRICT POINTED TO IMPROVEMENTS AN INTENDANTS AND SUSPENSION RATES THEY SAID THE SCHOOLS NO LONGER ON THE STATE WATCHLEST ONLY TO LEARN FROM THE CHRONICLE THE CHOOL WAS NOT ONLY STILL EN LEST BUT ALSO HAV DROPPED BE THE DISTRICT OFFICIALS LIKE WERE DOING EVEN BETTER AND THE CRONGS LIKE NOORNOT WE HAVE A LISTS RADER THE DESSITION TO BRING IN WOKE KINTERGARDEN RATHER TAN A MORE TRADITIONAL LITERACY OR MATH IN PROVEMENT PROGRAMMA LINES WITH THOUT BELIEF BY SOME PARENTS AND EDUCATORS THAT THE CURRENT EDUCATION SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING FOR MANY DISADVANTAGE TO CHILDREN THE SOLUTION TAYE THESE ADVOCATES IS FOR EDUCATORS TO CONFRONT LEGCIES OF CRSISM AND BY IS IN SCHOOLS AND TO TALK ABOUT HISTORIC WHAT SUPREMACY THE STUDENTS FEEL SAFE AND SUPPORTED NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WHICH AGAIN IS THAT THIS IS A JIANT FAIL SO WHAT EXACTLY IS IN THE WOKE KINERGARDEN CORRICULUM THAT IS FAILING SO DRAMATICALLY WHELE THE CORRICULUM INCLUDES WONDERINGS WHICH POSE QUESTIONS FOR STUDENTS QUESTIONS LIKE IF THE UNITED STATES DEFUNDED THESE RALLY MILITARY HOW COULD THEIS MONEY BE USED TO REBUILD PALESTINE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO ASK YOUR FIRST GRATER MEN IMPLICIT WITH ALL OF ITS RIDICULOUS STUPID IMMORAL ASSUMPTIONS IN A DISTION THE WOKE WORD OF THE DAY INCLUDES STRIKE CEASE FIRE AND PROTEST AFFERING STUDENTS QUOT LANGUAGE OF THE RESISTANTS TINS RODUCE CHILDREN TO LIBERATORY VOCABULARY AND A WAY THEY CAN EASILY DIGEST UNDERSTAND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY USE IN THEIR CRITICS OF THE SYSTEM THAT YEFT UNDERSTAND THAT WOKE KINNERA GARDEN IS JUST THE STUPIDEST BOILING DOWN OF WHAT IS IN FACT IN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL THEORY THERE IS A THERE IS A FURIST OF EDUCATION WHO IS VERY OFTEN QUOTED IN THESE TERMS AN POLOFERE POLIFERE WHOS TALKD ABOUT BY JAMES LENSY WHO E'VE HAD ON THE SUNDAY SPECIAL BEFORE HE WAS A BRAZILIAN EDUCATOR WHO TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE ALLED THE PETAGOGY OF THE APPRISE AND THE BASIC IDEA WASE THEY YOURE SUPPOSED TO INCULCATE IN STUDENTS NOT NOWLEDGE OR WISDOM OR EVEN WAS OF OF SOLVING PROBLEMS TYOUR SUPPOSED TO IMPOSE IN STUDENTS A REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY THAT WAS THE ENTIRE GOAL AND SOME OF HIS STUDENTS LIKE JANE THOMPSON SAID QUOT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A NEUTRAL EDUCATION PROCESS EDUCATION EITHER FUNCTIONS AS AN INSTRUMENT WHICH IS USED TO FACILITATE THE INTEGRATION OF GENERATIONS INTO THE LOGIC OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND BRING ABOUT CONFORMITY TO IT OR IT BECOMES A PRACTICE OF FREEDOM THE MEANS BY WHICH MEN AND WOMEN TILL CRITICALLY WITH REALITY AND DISCOVER HOUTS PARTICIPATE IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF THEIR WORLD AND THIS IS THE WAY THAT SO MUCH OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER IS THAT IT REALLY ISN'T WHEN WE STATE THEIRE ACHIEVING THEIR GOLK THEIR GOLL IS NOT INCREASE THE MATSCORES THAT GOES NOT TO INCREASE THE ENGLISH SCORES THE GOAL OF THESE EDUCATORS IS TO EXASCERBATE AGAIN INEQUITIES IT IS TO PRESENT AMERICA AS A TERRIBLE PLACE THAT MUST BE OVERTHROWN THAT IS THE GENERALIZED GOAL OF THESE SYSTEM SO THERE ACTUALLY DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DESIGNED TO DO BUT THE REALITY IS THEY LEAD TO MORE FAILURE WILL GET'ST MORE ON THIS IN ONE SECOND FIRST TOF FURE LIKE ME THERE'S NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY YOU

CINTERIGOWN  GARTON FOUNDER A PERSONAMED AKIO GROS A WARDED AGAIN A TWO EN OR FIFTY DOLAR OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR GRAMT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APARENTLY AND A HERE IS THIS HUMAN YES EVERYONE

WHO IS NOT ORIGINALLY ON THIS CONSIDENT NEEDS TO BE THROWN OFF THE CONTINENT WHAT THE HLLISHE DOING HERE THAT'S A WEIRD THING BUT AGAIN THE PETAGOGY OF THE APPRESSED IS THE WAY THAT KIDS ARE BEING TAUGHT IN PUBLIC SHOOLS NOW IT RUNS UP AGAINST REALITY WHICH THAT THIS IS A DEEPLY UNSUCCESSFUL WAY OF THINKING IT IS A WAY THAT FACILITATES UNSUCCESS FACILITATES THE SUFFERING OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES MAKES THEIR LIVES MATERIALLY WORSE IT IS DESTINED IT TO FAIL AND A MENTUALLY PARENTS MIGHT REALIZE THIS AND THE MIGHT THING HAY YOU NOW T BE GREAT IS MY CONECTUAL KNEW HOW TO DO MATH YOU KNOW T BE AWSUM IS IT MY KIDS ACTUALLY KNEW HOW TO READ THAT MIGHT BE A MORE USEFUL THING THAN BEING INCULCATED TO BE PART OF THE WOKE REVOLUTION BY MORONS LIKE THIS REALITY ALWAYS WINS AND REALITY IS GOING TO IN HERE AS WELL MAYBE THESE FOLKS WIN IN THE SHORT SUR RITAN THE LONG TERM THEY LEAD DOWN A DARK ROAD OF DESPAIR AND DEPRESSION AND AND FAILURE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCULCATED IN THE SYSTEM WILL BE FAILURES TBECAUSE THEY'R TRAINED TO BE FAILURES AND MEANWHILE REALITY SETTING IN AT AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS ANOTHER ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONS WHERE REALITY IS NOW SETTING IN IS DARTMOUTH SO DARTMOUTH ACTUALLY GOT RID OF THE SSA T DURING COVID AND NOW THEY'VE DECIDED TO PUT A BACK IN WHY ARE THEY USING THE SSA T AGAIN BECAUSE ORIGINALLY AGAIN THESE EQUITY FOOLS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTING THT BECAUSE THEYRE DISPRIT OUTCOMES WITH REGARD TO TE SSA T THAT FOR EXAMPLE BLACK STUDENTS ON AVERAGE DO LESS WELL ON THE SA TS AN THEN SAY WHITE STUDENTS AND WHITE STUDENTS YOU LESS WILE THESAY TEAS BY THEWAY THENATION STUDENTS BUT THEY NO MENTION EPART WHENEVER THEY SAY THAT THERE ARE GROUP DESPARITIES AND ESSAY T OUTCOMES THEY CLAIM THE TEST ITSELF IS RACIS WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE SAING THAT JUST BECAUSE JEWS ARE ON AVERAGE A LOT SHORTER THEN SAY NATIVES OF CERTAIN PARTS OF AFRICA THAT MUST MEAN THAT RULERS ARE BIAS RULERS ARE A PROBLEM CLEARLY WE NEED DIFFERENT YARD STICKS OR SOMETHING THE SSA TS ARE JUST A TEST THAT'S ALL THEY ARE AND AS IT TURNS OUT THEY ARE HIGHLY PREDICTIVE OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE SO DARTMOUTH GOT RID OF IT FOR A WHILE AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THITWAS A GIANT FAILED THEY WARE LETTING IN A BUNCH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO AF SHOU GO THROUGH DARTMOUTHS NOW THE BRINGING BACK THE SSA T AND THE A C T THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SCHOOL ACCORDING TO THE WALLSTER JOURNAL SAID IT WAS MAKING THE MOVE BASED ON NEW RESEARCH SHOWING THAT AT IVY LEAGUEAN OTHER HIGHLY SELECTED SCHOOLS STANDARDIZED TESTSCHORES HELP PREDICT FIRST YEAR COLLEGE PERFORMANCE EVEN BETTER THAN HIGH SCHOOL GRADES DO WHICH OF COURSE MAKES PORFECT SENSE BECAUSE THER'REA LOT OF HIGH SCHOOLS WE ARE GRATING ON A CURVE IF YOU WENT TO A CRAFPY HIGH SCHOOL IT MAY TURN OUT THAT IN A STUDENT AT A CRAPY HIGH SCHOOL IS EQUIVALENT TO A S STUDENTS AT A REALLY REALLY GOOD HIGH SCHOOL BUT THE SA T ISTHE SAME TEST THAT EVERY ONE IS TAKING LEE COFFIN THE VICE PRESIDENT AND DEAN OF ADMISSIONS AND FINANCIAL LIGHTS HADE QUOT I BECOME LESS CONVINCED THAT TEST OPTIONAL IS WR RKING FRESSODARMOUTH REANIMATING THE POLICY THAYS ON EVIDENCE HE SAID TERE ARE MANY OCCASIONS SINCE THE SCHOOL ADOPTED IT'S TEST OPTIONAL POLICY IN TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN THEY ADOPTED IT N TWENTY TWENTY NOT AS RESULT OF COVET BUT AS HE RESULT OF THE QUOTN QUOTE SOCIAL JUSTICE PROTESTS SURROUNDING THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOID BECAUSE A LIFE LONG CRIMINAL AND DRUG ATTIC DIED AND THIS RE JIGGERD ALL OF AMERICAN LIFE UP TO AN INCLUDING WHETHER YOU NEED TO TAKE AN S A T IN ORD TO GET INTO DARTMOUTH HE SAID THAT THERE ARE MANY OCCASIONS SINCE THE SHOOL ADOPTED ITS TEST OPTIONAL POLICY WHEN HE WISHED YOU HAD ONE MORE DATAPOINT ON A STUDENT TO QUOTE CONFIRM WHAT WE THINK AS A HIGH ACHIEVING PROFILE AN OTHER WORDS IT TURNS OUT THAT GOOD PREDICTOR IS REMAIN  GOOD PREDICTORS HE SAID TESCORS WILL BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL AS AS DARMOUTH RECEIVES MORE APPLICATIONS FROM HIGH SCHOOLS THAT ARE UNKNOWN TO THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE AND SCHOOLS ORE GREAT INFLATION IS A CONCERN IN FACT THE SIMPLE FACT OF E MATTER IS IN EXCELLENT WAY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN BAD NEIGHBORHOODS TO GET AHEAD IS TESTING TESTING ISN'T I'S A PALF WAY OUT IF YOURE REALLY SMART KID AND YOU WERE STUCK IN A CRAPPY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN A BAD SYSTEM AND YOU DIDN'T PER FORM IN THAT CRAPPY PUBLIC SCHOOL AN BAD SYSTEM BECAUSEYOUARE SURROUND BY BAT INFLUENCES BUT YOU SCORE HIGH ON THE ESSAY TEE THAT'S A GREAT WAY OF OVERCOMING THAT PARTICULAR BURDEN ATTRALLY WE TOMORON THES IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST AS YOU NO'VE EEN TALK ABOUT MY HELIK SLEEP MATTRESSFOR YEARS AND

BE LIES REALITY ALWAYS WINS REALITY IS ALSO WINNING WITH REGARD TWO ORE AMERICA STREETS SO THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT EVENTUALLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE IN THIS COUNTRY BETWEEN WHETHER WE ACTUALLY WANT POLICE OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB OR WHETHER WE DON'T WANT POLICE OFFICERS PERIOD THERE IS NO THIRD OPTION OR POLICE OFFICERS OUR MAGICAL DISPENSERS OF JUSTICE WHO NEVER MAKE MISTAKES IN EVERYTHINGLISH PRETTY OUN CAMERA THAT ITS NOT THE JOB OF COPS AND YET AND IN THE AFTERMOUTH OF THE GEORGE FLOID PROTESTS WE DECIDED THE BASICLY COPS WERE THE PROBLEM THET WHENEVER WE SAW AS CIVILIANS SOMETHING WE DIDN'T LIKE ON TAPE WE WERE THE BEST A JUDICATORY BODY FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF POLICE OFFICERS NOW THE REALITY IS THE DATO DAY LIFE OF THE POLICE OFICER IS INCREDIBLY DIFICLE YOU WOULDN'T WANT ON TO THAT CO WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT JOB ALL PEOPLE ON LEFT WHO WATCH POLICE OFFCER TACKLES ON MA TEL MY COHTOSORO O MY GOSHTHAT LOOKS A TERRIBLE ARE YOU THE ONE POLICING FOR DRUGS LIKE WHAT WHAT IS TH YOU DO AND THEREASON I ASK THAT IS NOT BECAUSE COPS DON'T DO THINGS WRONG THERE CERTAINTIMES OR COPS ABSOLUTELY DO THINGS WRONG AND WHEN THEY VIOLATE THE RULES THEN OBVIOUSLY THERE SHOULD BE PUNISHMENTS FOR THAT BUT INSTEAD WHAT YOU HAVE TYPICALLY IS PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE POLICE HAVE TO DO ROUGH THINGS TO ROUGH PEOPLE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE PEACSE AND SO THE YELL AT THE COPS EVERYTIME THEY SEE ATAPE OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WHAT THEY WOULD DO BECAUSE A NORMAL CIVILIANS DESCALLATION TECHNIC IS TO WALK AWAY FROM A CONFLICT THAT'S NORMALLY WHAT DO ESCOLLATION LOOKS LIKE FOR THOSE OF USL OR NOT MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FOR EXAMPLE WELL WHAT THAT'S RESULTING IN IS PEOPLE SIMPLY WALKING AWAY FROM THE JOB OF POLICING THE HARDER WE'VE MADE OP FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS THE FOUR POLICE OFFICERS THERE ARE THE FOUR POLICE OFFICERS THERE ARE THE MORY OF CITIES LIKE WASHINGTON DE SE THT AVE BEN COMPLETELY TAKEN OVER BY CRIME AND THE GENERALIZED ATTITUDE TOWARD COBS WHICH MOVED FROM DEFUN THE POLICE WHICH IS WAY TO OUT THEIR WAY TOO LOUD EVEN DEMOCRATS RAN AWAY FROM THAT SLOGAN SCREAMING BY LATE TWENTY TWENTY BECAUE OF THE INCREASING CRIMERATES TO DEMORALIZE THE POLICE DEMORALIZE THE PLICE REMAINS THE WAY THAT WE NOW DO POLICING IN THE UNITED STATES IS APPOINT BEING MADE BY HEATHER MC DONALD OVER IT CITY JOURNAL SHE SAYS ON GANUARY THIRTIETH THE NEWYOR CITY COUNCIL PASS THE HOW MANY STOPS ACT OVER THE VETO OF MARE ARIGADUMS THE LAW REQUIRES NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS TO FILL OUT OF FORM YEARELY EVERY TIME THEY INTRACT WITH THE CIVILIAN IF FOR EXAMPLE AND OFFICER ASKS A POTENTIAL BYSTANDER T A SHOOTING IF YOU HAD WITNESS THATSHUTING THE OFFICER WILL HAVE TO COM PLETE A FORM LISTING THE BYSTANDERS RACE SEC AND AGE ARE THERE OTHER POTENTIAL WITNESSES IN THE AREA WILL URGENTLY NEED TO BE CON TACTED BEFORE THEY DISPERSE TOO BAD IDENTITY BASE PAPER WORK COMES FIRST BUT THAT ACT IS INNOCUOUS COMPARED WITH CALIFORNIA'S DATED COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR POLICE OFFICERS NEW REQUORTING OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE RATIAL AND IDENTITY PROFILING ACT NOW REQUIRE CALIFORNIA OFFICERS TO FILL OUT IN EIGHT PAGE FORM WITH NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIELDS WHEN THEY MAKE WHAT IS KNOWN AS A COSTODIAL STOP MEANING THE CIVILIAN IS NOT FREE TO WALK AWAY THE FORM GENEARY BY THE CALIFORNIA TEOJE COMES STRAIGHT FROM THE RACE AND GENDERSTHUDY'S CLASS RUM THE OFFIER FIRST OCUMENTS WHETHER KEE THE OFFICOR IS A SISGENDER MAN SIXGENDERA WOMAN TRANSGENDERMAN TRANSGENERL WOMAN OR NON BINARY PERSON TO AVOID PLACING A RETROGRESS OF GENDER STRAIGHTJACK AN ON THE STATES PUBLIC SERVANTS THE FORM ALSO ALLOWS AN OFFER OFFICER TO CHECK BOTH NON BARN BINARY PERSON AND SISGENDER WOMAN FOR EXAMPLE THE OFFICER MUST LIST A SECUAL IDENTITY THERE'S ALSO AN EXTENSIVE OFFICE A RACE OR ATHNICITY SECTION THEN THE OFFICER HAVE TO DOCUMENT THE CIVILIANS PERCEIVED SEXUAL ORIENTATION EL G B PLOS OR STRAIGHT HETEROSEXUAL AND THE CIVILIANS PERCEIVED GENDER SIS GENDER TRANS GENDER OR NON BINARY THE DISCERNING OFFICER IS L AD TO SURMISE THAT THE PERSON THEYAVE STOPED IS MORE THAN ONE CALIFORNIA CREATED THE FORMAS HETHERMAT ONTEL POINTS OUT TO GIN UP ANTIPOLICE NARRATIVES ONCE IN OFFICERS IDENTITY PROFILE IS MERGE WITH THAT OF THE PERSON STOP THE POSSIBILITIES OF FINDING SOME FORM OF IDENTITY OPPRESSION ARE VIRTUALLY ENDLESS WHILE THE PREDICTABLE RESULT OF ALL THIS IS WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU JOIN UP AT A COP I'VE TALK TO COPS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY VERY FEW OF THEM HAVE HI MORAL RIGHT NOW EVERY POLICE OFFICER THAT I KNOW AN ALLI PE DOAN OL BUNCH OF THEM IS LOOKING TO GET OUT ITS FAST IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE AND THEY ARE SCARED TOU DEATH OF BEING ON THIS STREETS NOT BECASE THEY ARE SCARTER OF THE BADGISES BUT BECAUSE THY RE AFRAID THAT IF THEY DEAL WITH THE BAD GUIES AND THERE'S A BIZE STANDER WITH THE CAMERA ND THE RUNCH A MORE ONS WATCHING AND BE SE THAT THE OFFICER WILLSPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN JAIL AN SO THEY'VE STOPPE POLICING THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ON STREITS THE THING THEY SIGNED UP FOR IS THE THING THEY HAVE BEEN PROHIBITED FROM DOING BY THE WOKE WHICH IS WHY AS OF AUGUST OF LAST YEAR THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS EMPLOYED BY THE ALE PETY DROPPED BELOW NINE THOUSAND THET WASE A STAFFING LEVEL UN SEEN SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OFFICERS IS WAG TO LOW PEOPLEARE RETIRING AS FASTAS HUMANLY POSSIBLE PEOPLE ARE TAKING LIKE HALF PENSIONS IN ORDER TO GET THE HELL OUT THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING WITH THE N WI PD IN JULAG TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE NEURIC POST REPORTED THE NUMBER OF

EXPECTED THREE THOUSAND TESTTAKERS FOR THE WINTER EXAMINE AND THIRTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE SIGNED UP SO PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN SIGNING IT BECAUSE WHY WOULD YOU SIGN UP FOR THE AGAIN THIS IS REALITY WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE THEY CANNOT DO THEIR JOBS THTWILL BE PUNISHED FOR DOING THEIR JOBS AND THAT BASICALLY THEY ARE NOW GOING TO BE GENERA AND DIVERSITY WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOP CRIME WHO

THE DICATOR IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AGAIN REALITY IS THESE PEOPLE ARE UN POPULAR THEIRE UN POPULAR BECAUSE THEIR GOVERNMENTS IS BAD AND REALITY IS TARTING SEID IN ON PRETTY MUCH ALL SIZE WHEN IT COMES TO E LEGAL EMIGRATION FOR EXAMPLE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS CONSIDERED TOTALLY INSANE TO SUGGEST INVASION WAS HAPPENING AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER NOW OF COURSE THE POSITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS SHIFTED BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS IN INVASION OF THE SOUTHERNBORDER WHEN I SAY INVASION I DON'T MEAN THA THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER AS ILLEGAL EMOGRANS ARE ALL SEEKING TO DO AMERICAN'S TARM BECAS THAT ISN'T TRUE MANY OF THEM AURE COMING HERE IN ORDER TO EITHER WORK OR BE ON WELFARE WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS SAY IN INVADING ARMY BUT THE MEXICAN DRUNG CARE TELLS AURE IN CONTROL OF AMERICA SOUTHERN BORDER THEY ARE FACILITATING A VAST MIGRATION WEIVE THAT CONSTITUTIONEV AGAIN IV SAT ON THE BORDER I HAVE WATCHED MEXICAN DRUG CARTELL DRONES IN AMERICAN TERRITRAM NOT SURE WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THAT OTHER THAN IN INVASION EVEN AL SHARPTON IS NOW CALLING IT IN INVASION THAT'S HOW BADLY THINGS ARE GOING FOR THE DEMOCRAT THERE IS

WUT TO MAZING HERE IS SHARPTAN ADMITS THAT THERE'S EFFECTIVELY AN INVASION OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND CAN ALMOST SEE THE SENATOR CHRIST MURPHY WINCING WHEN HE SAYS THAT BUT HE'S LIMING REPUBLICANS FOR

TRY TO SPLIT REPUBLICANS OVER A BORDER BILL THE BORDER BILL HAS A BUNCH OF LAWS WITH WE WENT THROUGH IT IN DETAIL YESTERDAY ANNI MCARTHY ALSO GOES THROUGH IT IN DETAIL OVER AT NATIONAL REVIEW AND AS HE POINTS OUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS ABOUT THE BILL THAT ARE BETTER THAN CURRENT LAW SO STANDARDS FOR ASYLUM FOR EXAMPLE HAVE CHANGED THEY'VE BEEN A BIT STRENGTHENED IN SOME AREAS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT YOU NOW ARE SUPPOSED TO SHOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO STAY AT HOME IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY AND SMOVE ARIAS OR LIVE IN A COUNTRY THA YOU PASS THROUGH IN ORDER TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES BUT AGAIN ALL OF THE LAW DEPENDS UPON IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT IN THE END IS THE REAL PROBLEM JOBIDON HAS DEMONSTRATED ZERO CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE LAW AS WRITTEN HE HAS PLENTY OF LAW ON THE BOOKS THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO ENFORCE THE LAW RIGHT NOW AN AMA CARTHY SAYS CONGRESS OR PRESSURE BY TE USE IS EXISTING AUTHORITY TO SECURE THE BORDERN AND THE CRISIS THE MOST NOTABLE THING ABOUT THE CURRENT SENTORIAL PROPOSAL IS THAT I WULD UNDERMINE THE EXISTING PRESUMPTIONS IN THE LAW THAT LEGAL ALIENS SHOULD BE APPREHENDED DETAIN IN RAPIDLY REMOVED AND THAT THE UNITED STATES IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ASYLUM ANOTHER WORDS THE BASELINE A SUMPTION OF THE BILL IS THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL GET ASYLUM THAT CERTAIN NUMBER PEOPLE WILLN' BE IMPORTED INTO THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY AND ALL THE REST THE HOUSE GOPE ALSO ISSUED A STATEMENT RIPPING INTO THE BOREBILS THING S BASICALLY DEOA EVEN MITH MACONALL IN THE SENATE WE ORIGINALLY BACK THE BILL IS NOW SAYING HE'S NOT KING TO BRING IT UP FOR A VOTE IF HE HAS ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT CAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE SENATE NURER TO EFFECTUATE ITS PASSAGE BUT THE HOUSE MAJORITY IN THE IN THE HOUSE THEY SAY QUOTE HOUSE REPUBLICANS OPPOSE THE SENATE IMIGRATION BILL HES IT FAILS IN EVERY POLICY AREA NEEDED TO SECURE OUR BORDER AD WOHULD ACTUALLY INSENS BIS MORE ILLEGAL EMIGRATION AMONG ITS MANY FLAWS THE BILL EXPANDS WORK AUTHORIZATIONS FOR LEGAL ALIENS WHILE FAILING TO INCLUDE CRITICAL ASYLUM REFORMS EVEN WORSE IT'S LANGUAGE ALLOWSY LEGALS TO BE RELEASED FROM PHYSICAL COSTODY AND THAT WOUL EFFECTIVELY INDORSE THE BITING CATTEN RELY'S POLICY THE SO CALLED SHUT DOWN AUTHORITY IN THE BILL IS ANYTHING BUT RILDS WITH LOOPOLES THAT GRANT FAR TO MUCH DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO SECRETARY ALAHANDRO MAYARKAS THE BILL ALSO FAILS TO ADEQUATELY STOP THE PRESIDENT'S ABUSIVE PARAL AUTHORITY AND PROVIDES FOR TAX PAYR FUNDS TO FLY IND HOUSI LEGAL EMIGRANTS IN HOTELS THROUGH THE FEMAT SHELTER AND SERVICES PROGRAMM IN OTHER WORDS WHY DOESN'T JOBIDAN JUS DUE HIS JOB THAT IS A SENSIOR OF THE HOUSE JIOP IS SAME AND THE PROTESTATIONS BY DEMOCRATS THAT JOBID NEENS MORE AUTHORITY THOSE ARE FALLING ON DEFIERS BCAUS THEY AREN'T TRUE HERE'S CHRISTMURPHY TRYING TO DO THAT RETIN THE SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT  DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT BY NSHUN JUST ANIT  THIS TISSU WAY FROM THE RPUBLICANS WHO SEEM TO BE PLANK PORTTHATS WITH IT THEN USE EVERY BIT OF HIS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THE BORDER PRISIS AT IS ON SAY BASICALLY WELL PASS THE LEGISLATION OCAB NDO MYSELF WITHOUT BEING CONSTRATIGY FOR HIM WHAT IS THE PROBGAVID I THE PRESENT KIN TE ISPY HIMSELF THE PRESENT DOSENT HASS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY WITHOUT HET DIS TIONAL LEGISLATION TO CONTROL THE BORDERS FIXS THE BROKEN ASILEN SYSTEM IN THE WAY S AIT MEANS TO BE DONE AND THIS IS PARTOF THE ICTION TA GETS PERPETUATED OF THE MARICUL PUBLIC BY REPUBLICANS THE F HE WANTED TO PASSBORDER LEGISLATION LAST HER N TAT IT WAS SO IMPORT ED TOF AN HOUS FOR SENITIS THAT THEY MAD E ACHAR SU IS THE SECOND BUILL THEY INTRODUCED TAS SOON AS AT THE KINGS CLEAR THAT BY PARTISAN BORDER FOR LEGISLATION MIGHT PASS REPUBLICISENT HOUSTOR SCREAMING NOW THE PRESDENT DOESN'T NEED ANY NE LAWS HE HAS ALL THE AUTHORITY HE NMEEDS THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE YE IT IS TRUE ON THE LAWS NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE THE AUTHORITY HE IS REQUIRED FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE ICE TO PORT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND HE'S NOT DOING ANY OF THAT IS NOT INTERESTED IN DOING ANY OF THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS THIS AND THE REALITY IS GOING TO BE VERY HARSH FOR JOBIDEN ON THAT ISSUE SPEAKING OF WHAT TREVENTUALLY REALITY IS GOING TO SET IN WITH REGARD TO THE ECONOMY AS WELL SO RIGHT NOW H OURE BEEN FLOATING ABOVE THE  ECONOMIC REPRECAUTIONS FOR HAVING SPENT MORE MONEY THAN GOD HAS EVER SEEN JEROME POWELL THE FEDCHAIR HE SAYS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT RATE CUTS AT THIS POINT CONSIDERING THAT THE ECONOMY CONNT CONTINUES TO TRULY CHUG AND WE HAVE GOOD EMPLOYMENT RIGHT NOW VERY VERY GOOD EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS WAGES ARE FINALLY STARTING TO RISE AND AS SUPPOSED TO INFLATION AND SO ONE TH THINGS HE'S WORRIED ABOUT IS INJECTING MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM BUT ONE OF THE THINGS HE'S POINTING OUT IS THAT THE FUTURE OBSTACLE TO GROWTH IS NOT GOING TO BE THE INFLATIONARY RATES RGHT NOW THE BIG OSTOBSTACLE TO GROWTH IS GOING E THE FACT THAT GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO EAT UP MORE AND MORE OF THE PRIVETE STECTOR EARNINGS IN THE UNITED STATES AND TAT'S GON TO HAVE TO BE MADE UP SOMEWHERE HERE WAS FEDSHARPAWEL SAYING THE UNITED STATES DON AN UNSUSTAINABLE FISCAL PATH SO FOR ALL THE HAPPY TALK THAT WE'VE BEENHEARING ABOUT THE ECONOMY THE REALITY IS THE LONG FROM PHYSICAL FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES EVENTUALLY WILL HIT REALITY AS WELL HOW DO YOU SES THE NATIONAL DET WE MOSTLY TRY VERY HARD NOT TO COMMENT ON FISCAL POLICY AND AND AH YOU KNOW IT STRUCK CONGRESS ON HAD TO DO THEIR JOB POINTIT ACTUALLY THEY HAVE OVER SIDE OVER US BUT IS THE NATIONAL BET OR DANGER TO THE ECONOMY IN YOU REVIEW IN THE LONG RUN THE UUS IS ON UNSUSTAINABLE FISCO PATHEUS FEDERAL GOVERMENTS ON UNSSATLE FISCOL PATH AND THAT JUST MEANS TAIT THE DET IS GROWING FASTER THAN THE ECONOMY WHALL THAT IS NOT CURABLE IF YOU THINK YOU CAN OUTGROW THE DET NOT AT THE RATES THAT WE ARE RACKING UP DEBT BUT MEANWHILE JOBIDON CONTINUES TO DARE REALITY TO CLOCK HIM SO YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE HE WAS BRAGGING ABOUT HIS ATTEMPTS TO GO AROUND A SUPREME COURT ORDER TELLING HIM HE CANNOT UNILATERALLY RELIEVES TUN LONDET AND HE SAYS THE SUPREMECOURT BLOCKSME BUT DIDN'T STOP ME   AGAIN WE USED TO CALL THAT DICTITORIAL TYPE LANGUAGE THEY BLOCKED ME BUT THEY DIDN'T STOP ME THEY LITERALLY TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THE THING IN THAN YOU WENT YOU DID THE THING THAT'S IT THAT'S AN AMAZING STATEMENT BY JOBITON HE'S UNILATTERALLY RAISING DEBT AT THIS POINT EVENTUALLY THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE EVENTUALLY THERE ARE ALWAYS CONSEQUENCES THE SAME HOLDS TRUE IN THE MIDDLELEAST AS WELL JOBITON HAS SENT EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF MAX SIGNALS ON THE ONE HAND HEL ON LEISH AMERICAN STRIKES ON EIGHTY SEPARATE TAR GAT SIMULTANEOUSLY HIT ON THE OTHER HAND HE WILL THEN TELL ISRAEL THAT ISRAEL HAS TO STOP WITH REGARD TO WHAT I'S DOING WITH CISBELL ON THE NORTH THAT IS WIL HAS TO BE KINDER TO HAMASS THAT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO PURSUE AS THE UNITED STATES IS THAT WE REALLY NED TO PERSUADE TWO STATES SOLUTION THAT INCENTIVIZES ISLOMIC TERRORISM THOSE MAX SIGNALS ARE BEING TAKEN AS WEAKENESS BUY ALL THE PARTIES THAT HATE THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW IF JOBID AN ACTIVELY WANTED TO STOP TPOTENTIAL CONFLICT FROM BRADENINGIN THE MDLAST WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO IS SAY THAT AMERICA IS A WALL THAT AMERICA IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW THIS TO BRADEN INTO A LARGER CONFLICT IN THE IDLEST THAT IF HISBALLAW DOES NOT FOR EXAMPLE MOVE NORTH OF A RIVER THAT THEYARE BOWND BY INTERNATIONAL LAW TO MOVE NORTH OF THF THAT'SOWN IN THE SOUTH OF LEBONON IS NOT TO MILITORIZED THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO FUND ISRAEL TO THE EXTENT THAT ISRAEL BE ABLE TO BASICALLY DESTROY HIS BELLAWWHERE IT STANDS THAT'S WHAT THE UNITED STATES HULD BE DOING IF THEY WANT TO PREVENT FURTHER WAR RIGHT NOW THE BIGGEST PROB THE UNITED STATES HAS THAT IS NOT A CREDIBLE ACTOR IN HE MDDELEAST THERE'S NO CREDIBLE THREAT FROM THE UNITED STATES CALLING UP AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND WARNING THEM ABOUT POTENTIAL STRIKES IS NOT EXACTLY SET TO CREATE A DEEP QUAKING AND TREMBLING IN THE ARANIAN REGINE NOW THE WHITEHOUSE IS REALIZING THAT THEY'R RING TO WALK AT BACK SO THE WAR REPORTS BEFORE A SET OF STRIKES THAT A WEEK AGO THAT THE OUS HAD WARNED THE AROCKY GOVERNMENT WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY RUN BY RON THAT AMERICAN STRIKES WERE FORTHCOMING NOW ACCORDING TO POLITICA TH UUS IS SAYING THAT I DID NOT DIRECTLY NOTIFY THE AROCKY GOVERNMENT AMERICAN FORCES WOULD STRIKE INSIDE THE COUNTRY ON FRIDAY CONTRARY TO AN EARLIER WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT YOU US FORCEIS CONDUCTED AIR STRIKES AGAINSTERONIAND MILITANS IN AROCK AND SYRION FRIDAY AS RETALIATION FOR THE KILLING OF THREE O A SOLDIERS IN JORDAN BY ERONIAN PROXY GROUPS ON MONDAY SATE DEPARTMENT SPOKES PERSON VADON PATAL TOLDS REPORTERS THAT THERE WAS NOT PRENOTIFICATION AND THE U S INFORMED THE ROCKIES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE STRIKES THE AROCKY GOVERNMENT QUOTE UNDERSTOOD THEREWOULD BE RESPONSE AFTER THE DEBTS OF OUR SOLDIERS BUT THAT CONTRADICTED WET THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKES PERSON JOHN KURBY SAID IN A CALLED ON FRIDAY WES TO WHAT WE DID INFORMA THE AROCKY GOVERNMENT PRIOR TO THE STRIKES OCCURRING KURBY THEN WALKED IT BACK HE SAID WELL I RESPONDED WITH IN FORMATION I'D BEEN PROVIDED AT THE TEMPTS WHOT YU BELIEVE THE BI ADMINISTRATION OFTHE BY DEMINISTRATION I' TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE I BELIEVE THAT THE BYN ADMINISTRATION IS BASICALLY WARNING THE ARONIANS TO GET THEIR PEOPLE OUT OF HARM'S WAY WHICH IS LEAVING THE ARONIANS TO THNK OKAE WE CAN PUSH JOBIDON PRETTY MUCH AS FAR AS WHE WANT A PUSH AND IN FACT THE STRIKES AGAINST AMERICANTARGETS HAVE NOTSEASED AT ANY POINT HERE 'S THE PENSAGON PRESS SECRETARY MAJOR GENERAL PATRICK RIDER CONFIRMING YESTERDAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUE DRONE ATTACKS ON AMERICAN TARGET IN TERMS OF ATTACKS IN I RACK IN SERIOUS ANCE WE TOOK THESE STRIKES ON FRIDAY IM ACKSALY ONLY TRACKING TO INCIDENTS  THERE WAS ONE ATTACK ON SATURDAY AN FEBRUARY THE THIRD THAT WAS TWO ROCK ITS THAT WERE FIRED AT AMESS U PRATIES IN SERIA O WITH NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE REPORTED AND THEN I'M AWARE OF ONE YESTERDAY FEBRUARY FORTH THIS WAS AA ONE WAY ATTACK TRON THAT LANDED SEVERAL KILOMETERS FROM AMESS A GREEN VILLAGE I'M ALSO IN SERIA AGAN NO REPORTED U S INJURIES OR DAMAGE TO THOSE FACILITIES  DO AGAIN IT TURNS OUT THE REALITY A JUSTIN MHT ELEAST AND WEAKNESS WILL BE MET WITH AGGRESSIAN FROM THE ARONIANS THIS NOT A SHOT AND EVERY TIME JOBIDN AND HIS TEAMS TA TWO STATES SOLUTION THE DEVIL SMILES BECAUSE TE REALITY IS THAT A TWO STATE SOLUTION IS NOT A REAL POSSIBILITY GIVEN THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IN TH MID DELEAST RIGHT NOW THE PALCINIAN AUTHORITIES A TERROR FOMENTING GROUP GAUSA STRIP IS RUN BY HAMOSS WHICH IS A TERROR GROUP THAT JUST COMMITTED THE WORS SETROCIT AGAINST USINCE WORLD WHER TOO PAUSING AN AUTHORITY S NOTTING HOW CONTROL OVER THE WESTPANK THEY CAN'T TAKE CONTROL OVER THE GOZISTRIP THEYARE NOT TRUSTWORTHY PARDNERS EVEN IF THEY COULD NO OTHER STATE WILL FACILITATE THE REBUILDING OF GOZA AND MEANWHILE THE BY DEMINISTRATION ALL THEIR DOING BY PLAYING THIS GAME IS SIGNALING WEAKNESS TO THE BROADER MIDDLE EAST IT'S ABSOLUTELY FOOLHARDY REALITY IS IN A SET IN THE MIDELEAST TO BECAUSE AGAIN  T ATTEMPS TO PICK AWAY AND AMERICAN MIGHT IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO PICK AWAY OF FREEDOM OF TRATE IN THE RET THAT THOSE WILL CONTINUEHS ARE NOT GOING TO STOP SO LONG AS JOBIDON CONTINUES TO SHOW THE AMERICAN NECK NOW MEANWHILE SECRETARY STATE TONY BLINKON ARRIVED IN THE MIDDELEAST ON MONDAY THE HOPES OF PREVENTING ESCALATING TIT FOR TAT ATTACKS WIT THE RON BACKED MILICIOUS FROM SPILERING SPIRALLING INTO A BROADER REGIONAL WAR NOW AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S THE WAY TO DO THAT WHEN TIT FOR TAT SHOUD BE TIT FOR HELL FIRE MISSIL THEY HID AMERICA WITH HADRONE ND WE BLOW AWAY COSEMSOY MONEY RIGHT THAT SHOULD BE THE WAY THAT AMERICA DEALS WITH TREATS BECAUSE THE BRON DOES NOT WANT WAR MORE THAN THE UNITED TIT IC AND THIS IS HOW TO TURNS WORF THIS IS A BASE LINE FOREIGN POLICY WONT O ONE IN THE MIDDLEAST DO NOT SHOW YOUR NACK TO YOUR ENEMIES IF YOU DO IT WILL BE BAD TRYING TO RAP ALL OF THIS INTO A BALL AND THEN CLAIM THAT IF ISRAEL MAKES CONCESSIONS TO THE PALISINIANS MAGICALLY EVERYTHING IS GOING TO FIX ITSELF IS ABSURD COMMOSS LITERALLY REJECTED ANOTHER SEAS FIRE YESTERDAY COMMOSS IS CURNENLLY HOLDING OVER A HUNDRED HOSTAGES STILL AND THEY'ARE USING THOSE HOSTAGES AS BATE TO GET ISRAEL TO LEAVE COMMOSS IN PLACE TO THE DELIGHT DOF VERON IN IS CONVERSATION WITH MOHAMMED BEEN TOMON BLINK IN STRUST THE IM PORTANCE OF ADDRESSING THE HUMANITARIANS SITUATION AN GAZA MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PALISTANY TOM AN KILLED THERE SINCE OCTOBER SEVENTH ACCORDING TO THE GOZ AND HEALTH MINISTRY NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEN DISPLACED BY THE FIGHTING BUT THE REALITIES DO YOU THINK THE SOUTIES CARED EEPLY ABOUT WITS GOING ON INTHE GOZISTRIP THE ONLY THING THE SOUTIES CARE ABOUT ACTUALLY IS THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMASS THE SOUTY HAVE VERY LITTLE IF THE SUTIES CARED DEEPLY ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON A GOSIP DON'T YOU THINK CAN BE OFFERING A LITTLE MORE HUMANITARIANADE DON'T YOU THING THAT THE WOULD BE OFFERING SO EXITVISAS TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LEAVE THE GOZISTRIP IN THEMIDDLE OF THIS WAR AND OT DOING ANY F THOSE THINGS THE SOUTIES WERE PERFECTLY WILLING TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE WITH ISRAEL THE DAYBIDAN TOOK OFFICE AND THEN HE PROCEEDED TO ALIENATE THE SOUTI'S IN FAVOR OF TRYING TO BRING THE ARANIANS INTO THE FOLD FOOLISHNESS HAS CONSEQUENCES ALWAYS AND FOR EVER NOW I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT NOT ONLY DOES REALITY ALWAYS WHEN BUT I ROOT FOR REALITY AND THAT'S TRUE I DO ROOT FOR REALITY BECAUSE THE FASTER PEOPLE SEE REALITY THE FASTER WEEN GET TO ACTUAL POLICY BASE SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS WE FACE WHEN IT COMES TO CRIME IT TURNS OUT THE YELLING AT THE COFS DOES NOT CON FIX CRIME WHEN COMES TO EDUCATION IT TURNS OUT THE TEACHING STUDENTS IDIOCY ABOUT EQUITY IS NOT CONFIXE THE PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION IT TURNS OUT THAT POLITICAL MACINATIONS IN WHICH WO LEAVE THE BORDER OPEN WHILE CLAMING THE OTHER SIDE SOMEHOW DOESN'T CARE ENOUGH THAT IS NOT GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND WHEN COMES TO MITHELEAST WEAKNESSING

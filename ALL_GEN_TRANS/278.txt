EPIC ROAD TRIP ANY OF US COULD HAVE POSSIBLY IMAGINED AT THE TIME WE PILED INTO MY DAD'S BEWIC SKYLARK AND DROWE FROM QUEEN'S NEW YORK TO THE WORLD'S FARE IN NOXVILL TENNESSEE WERE A ROBAT DANCE FOR US AND THEN DOWN INTO OURLANDO FORIT THIS WAS A BIG DEAL BEFORE THIS GOING AWAY MEANT VISITING RELATIVES AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND SITTING UNCOMFORTABLY AMONG AUNTS AND SECOND COUSINS WHOSE NAMES I WOULD FORGET BEFORE WE EVEN PULLED OUT IN THEIR DUSTY DRIVEWAYS THIS TRIP WAS NOT COUNTRY HEAT AND SIPPING SUGAR ORDER ON SOME RICKETY PORCH WHILE LISTENING TO THE INSCRUTABLE CONVERSATION OF GROANFUL IT WAS WHAT GOING A THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME SHAD FEELI WE CRUISED OWN A BRIGHTLY LIT STREET CALLED INTERNATIONAL DRY WE STAYED AT A HOLIDAY IN TALLER AND MORE GRAND THAN ANY ID EVER SEEN SONLIGHT STREAMED IN THROUGH A HOLE IN THE SEILING A WHOLE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE OUR PARENTS TOOK US TO A BUILDING AT  LIKE A PILE OF POACHED EGGS BUT WAS ACTUALLY SANATU HOUSE OF THE FU TURE AND EVERYWHERE ALONG EVERY ROAD SIDE TIUL BOARDS PROMISE THAT THE MOST MAGICAL SCENE STILL AWAITED US HIS PLACE DISNYWY ALL ACCOUNTS IN HIS PARADISE FOR KIDS BUT BE TWEEN THE GAS AND THE WHO TOWELS ON THE EATING OUT MY DAD QUICKLY DISCOVERED HOW EXPENSIVE TAKING EVEN SIXTY PERCENT OF HIS BROD ON A DISNY VACATION COULD BE HE WAS RESIGNED TO DO IT BUT HE WASN'T ABOVE WORKING THE ANGLES HE FOUND OUT THAT YOU COULD GET CHEAP TICKETS TO THE MAGIC KINGDOM IF HE JUST SIGNED OUT TO SIT THROUGH AN HOUR OR SO SH BEAL FROM SOME ONE PITCHING TIME SHARES HE WAS IN THE HARD CELL WENT DOWN AT THE DISNY VILLAGE A BRANDED MANY MAUL NEAR THE FAMOUS STEAM PARK MY MAM DAD AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER DETERMINED PARENTS STOWED THEIR KIDS IN A ROOM FULL OF TOYS THAT HAD BEN CONVENIENTLY PROVIDED BY THE SALESPEOPLE THE PARENTS SET ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF LISTENING ERE NOT WAITING PATIENTLY FOR THE MOMENT WHEN THE CLOSERS WOULD STOPP SHILLING AND START HANDING OUT THE DISNY DISCOUNT BUT WHILE WE KIDS WERE IN ANOTHER ROOM THROWING LEGOS AT ONE ANOTHER SOMETHING SURPRISING APPIN MY DAD BIT HE WENT INTO A CLOSED ROOM TO GET THREE DAY PASSES JUST SO THAT I COULD EVENTUALLY LOSE MY GLASSES ON SPACE MOUNTAIN ND HE CAME OUT WITH THE DEE THE DEED TO SOMETHING HE AND MY MOM WERE NOW CALLING OUR VILLA MY FATHER WAS A BOLD MAN BUT IN RETROSPECT THIS IS THE MOST IMPETUOUS ACTION THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN HIM TAKE IT COST HIM ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH HE PAID IN INSTALLMANTS IN NINETEEN EGHTY TWO FOR A GUY WITH FIVE KIDS E NEVER MADE MORE THAN THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AT HIS DAJOB IT WAS A CON SIDERABLE IN VESTEBUT THOSE UN FAMILIAR WITH TIME SHARES AND MAY BE HARD TO RAP YOUR HEAD AROUND BUYING A VACATION HOME THAT YHE NEVER REALLY OME YOU PAY UP FRONT FOR IT IT'S AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE BUT YOU ONLY GET TO STAY IN IT ONCE A YEAR OR SO USUALLY FOR WEEK AT A TIME IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE SOME SORT OF SCAM AND SOMETIMES IT IS BUT IT DIDN'T TURN OUT THAT WAY FOR US INSTEAD IT BECAME A FIXTURE IN MY FAMILY MY FATHER HAD CHOSEN AS OUR WEEK THE FIRST WEEK IN JULY AND SO EVERY YEAR DURING ONE OF THE HOTTEST MONTHS OF THE YEAR WE WOULD HAD DOWN I NIGHTY FIVE IS ALWAYS BUT NOW WHEN WE PULLED INTO SOUTH CAROLINA TO SEA RELATIVES THAT WAS ONLY A PITT STOP ON THE WAY OF OUR TRUE DESTINATIONS WE HAD TRANSFORMED FROM PEOPLE WHO WENT AWAY TO A FAMILY   WHEN ON BAKING OUR BILLA WAS NUMBER THREE SEVENTEEN A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT WITH AN ENCLOSED BACK PORT AT LOOKED OUT ON TO A SMALL MAN MADE LATE IWEWITH FISH DUCKS AND ANOTHER SUMMER WORD THAT I LEARN THEZEBO MY BROTHER CHASED TICADAS AND

LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS TRIP EVERY YEAR AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLY A WEEK IT WAS ALMOST ALWAYS THE HIGH LIGHT OF MY ENTIRE SUMMER BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT NOW IT OCCURS TO ME MY DAD PRETTY MUCH ORCHESTRATED THIS THING THAT BECAME SO IMPORTANT TO OUR LIVES AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT HE EVER ENJOYED IT HIMSELF IN FACT IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE DID I CAN'T RECALL ACTUALLY SEEING HIM HAPPY NEITHER IS MY BROTHER HE SAYS DAD WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AT THE TIME SHARE AS HE WAS AT HOME SOMETIMES HEU'D GO FOR WALKS ALONE BUT OFTEN HE JUST SAT ON THE COUCH AND WATCH HE BE I ASKED MY SISTER SHE SAID HE MUST HAVE BEEN HAPPY BUT SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER WITNESS HE HAD EITHER IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A SIMPLE QUESTION BUT I JUST WANTED TO KNOW  DID HE ENJOY HIMSEL ATHE RISK OF INBIDYING THE MOST TIRED TROP AN ALL OF MODERN MASCULINITY I WILL SAY MY FATHER AND I NEVER REALLY GOT ALONE HE WAS STRICT HIS HOUSE HAD A LOT OF RULES AND HE BELIEVED IN CORPORAL PUNISHMENT AND THE STING OF THAT

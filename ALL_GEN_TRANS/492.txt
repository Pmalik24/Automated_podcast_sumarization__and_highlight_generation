WELCOME TO THE UBERMANTA SCIENCE SCIENCE PASE TOCE I MAY ANDRUHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEURBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ABOUT THE BIOLOGY PSYCHOLOGY AND PRACTISES OF SOCIAL BONDING FROM THE DAY WE ARE BORN UNTIL THE DAY WE DIE THE QUALITY OF OUR SOCIAL BONDS DICTATES MUCH OF OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IT SHOULD THEREFORE BE NO SURPRISE THAT OUR BRAIN AND INDEED MUCH OF OUR ENTIRE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS WIRED FOR SOCIAL BONDS NOW SOCIAL BONDS OCCUR BETWEEN INFANT AND PARENT THERE EVEN PARTICULAR WIRING DIAGRAMS WITHIN THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD AND BODY THAT ARE ORIENTED TOWARDS THE SPE CIFIC BONDS THAT OCCUR BETWEEN INFANT AND MOTHER AS WELL AS INFANT AND FATHER ND WE HAVE SPECIFIC BRAIN CIRCUITRIES FOR FRIENDSHIP SPECIFIC BRAIN CIRCUITRIES THAT ARE ACTIVATED IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND AS IT GOES SPECIFIC BRAIN CIRCUITRIES THAT ARE ACTIVATED WHEN WE BREAK UP WITH A ROMANTIC PARTNER OR WHEN THEY BREAK UP WITH US OR WHEN SOMEBODY PASSES AWAY MOVES AWAY OR OTHER WISE LEAVES OUR LIVES IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THOSE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM CIRCUITRIES WE RE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NEUROCHEMICALS AND HORMONES THAT UNDERLIE THEIR FUNCTION AND WE ARE GOING TO TOUCH ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT AND ACTIONABLE TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY IN EVERY DAY LIFE AND BECAUSE WE ARE HEADED INTO THE HOLIDAY THE NEW YEARAND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY THAT YOU CAN DEPLOY IN YOUR VARIOUS INTERACTIONS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS AND SHOULD YOU NOT BE SPENDING TIME WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS TO DAY WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL BONDS OUT OF THE CONTEXT OF FAMILY AND ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP SO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO INCLUDE A LOT OF SCIENCE A LOT OF ACTIONABLE TOOLS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL COME AWAY FROM TO DAY'S EPISODE WITH TREMENDOUS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW YOU FUNCTION FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR N INTREVERT OR AN EXTRAVERT WHY IS THAT TURNS OUT THERE MAY BE A NEUROCHEMICAL BASIS FOR THAT MAYBE AR SOMEBODY THAT REALLY ENJOYS SOCIAL MEDIUM MAY BE AR SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T TODAMN GOING TO TALK ABOUT A GENE OR SET OF GENES THAT PREDICTS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL FOLLOW MORE PEOPLE OR SEEK OUT MORE ON LINE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OR FEWER BELIEVE NT ARE NOT THERE'S BIOLOGY AROUND THAT NOW IN ITS EXCELLENT PUREREVIEWED WORK WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW BONDS ARE BROKEN AND WHY BREAK UPS CAN BE SO PAINFUL NOT JUST ROMANTIC BREAK UPS BUT BREAK UPS WITH FRIENDSHIPS AND CO WORKERS AND OW TO MOVE THROUGH THOSE MORE SEEMLESSLY SO REGARDLESS OF YOUR AGE AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU ARE IN A ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIP OF ONE FORMER ANOTHER OR NOT I DO BELIEVE THIS EPISODE WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU AS YOU EXPLORE THE SOCIAL BONDS THAT ALREADY EXIST IN YOUR LIFE END AS YOU SEEK OUT NEW AND CHANGING SOCIAL BONDS BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELYTED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSERS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE

ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IEF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION END THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF SOCIAL BONDING AND I WANT TA POINT OUT THAT I USE THE WORD BONDING INTENTIONALLY IT'S A VERB AND IN BIOLOGY WE WANT A THINK ABOUT VERBS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN BIOLOGY IS A PROCESS IT'S NOT AN EVENT AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THINGS IN BIOLOGY IS A PROCESS THAT MEAEN S IT'S GOING HAVE MULTIBLE STEPS AND TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO EXPLORE THE STEP START TO FINISH OF SOCIAL BONDING MEANING HOW SOCIAL BONDS ARE ESTABLISHED HOW THEY ARE MAINTAINED HOW THEY ARE BROKEN AND HOW THEY ARE RE ESTABLISHED NOW AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF BIOLOGY GENERALLY BUT IN PARTICULAR AS IT RELATES TO SOCIAL BONDING IS THAT THE NURAL CIRCUITS MEANING THE BRAIN AREAS AN NURONS AND THE HORMONES THINGS LIKE OXYTOSEN WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT TO DAY ND THE OTHER CHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN EMBODY THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROCESS WE CALL SOCIAL BONDING ARE NOT UNIQUE TO PARTICULAR SOCIAL BONDS THEY ARE GENERIC WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT THE SAME BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING A BOND BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD ARE ACTUALLY REPURPOSE IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS THIS MIGHT NOT COME AS A SURPRISE TO MANY OF YOU MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THIS IDEA OF SECURELY ATTACHED PEOPLE VERSES ANXIOUS ATTACHED PEOPLE VERSES AVOIDEN DATTACHED PEOPLE WE'RE GOING TO TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT ALL OF THAT HAS ROOTS IN WHEATHER NOT CHILDREN AND PARENTS FORMED HEALTHY SOCIAL BONDS OR WHETHER NOT THEY HAD CHALLENGE SOCIAL BONDS NOW IT'S CLEAR FROM THE SCIENTIFIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A NOT SO GRAT OR EVEN TERRIBLE SOCIAL BOND WITH APPARENT OR WITH SOME OTHER CARETAKER OR LOVED ONE AS A CHILD THAT DOESN'T FATE YOU TO HAVE POOR CSOCIAL BONDS AS AN ADULT THERE'S A LOT OF PLASTICITY IN THE SYSTEM MEANING IT CAN CHANGE IT CAN REWIRE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE AND AS WE WILL SOON DISCOVER THERERE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS WITHIN THE NURL CIRCUITS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOCIAL BONDING THAT ALLOW YOU TO PLACE SUBJECTIVE LABELS ON WHY YOU ARE DOING CERTAIN THINGS AND TO REWIRE THE NURL CIRCUITS FOR SOCIAL BONDINGS WE'RE GIN TO TOUCH ON ALL OF THAT TODAY BUT THE IMPORTANT FEATURE REALLY TO POINT OUT IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TWELVE DIFFERENT CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN EMBODY FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIAL BONDS WE HAVE ONE AND THERE SOME UNIVERSAL FEATURES THAT UNDERLIE ALL FORMS OF SOCIAL BONDS SO WERE GIN A START BY EXPLORING WHAT THOSE NURL CIRCUITS ARE AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO SEE HOW THEY PLUG IN TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIAL BONDS AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO EXPLORE THINGS LIKE INTROVERSION EXTRAVERSION WERE EVEN A TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THINGS LIKE TROMOBONDS HEALTHY BONDS AND VARIOUS OTHER ASPECTS OF HOW HUMANS CAN BOND TO ONE ANOTHER AND AS YOU'LL SOON DISCOVER THERE IS A UNIQUE CHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF ALL BONDING OF ALL KONDS AND YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO MODULATE THAT CHEMICAL SIGNATURE BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL BONDING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ITS MIRROR IMAGE WHICH IS LACK OF SOCIAL BONDING OR SOCIAL ISOLATION NOW FOR BETTER FOR WORSE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS LITERATURE ON THE BIOLOGY OF SOCIAL ISOLATION AND ALL OF THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN ANIMALS OR HUMANS AR SOCIALY ISOLATED AT PARTICULAR PHASES OF LIFE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTROVERTS YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY DAMAGING YOURSELF BY DECIDING TO SPEND LESS TIME WITH OTHER PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE LIKE TIME ALONE I PERSONALLY AM AN INTROVERT I GET A THRILL OUT OF SPENDING TIME WITH ONE OR TOO CLOSE FRIENDS BUT I ENJOY A LOUT OF TIME BY MYSELF I LIKE TO SOCIALIZE SO I WOULDN'T CALL MYSELF AN EXTREME INTRAVERT BUT I KNOW THERE SOME EXTREME INTROVERTS OUT THERE BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL ISOLATION WHAT WERE REFERRING TO IS WHEN ANIMALS ARE HUMANS ARE RESTRICTED FROM HAVING THE SOCIAL CONTACTS THAT THEY WOULD PREFER TO HAVE AND TO JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE MAJOR TAKE AWAYS FROM THIS LITERATURE WHICH SPANDS BACK A HUNDRED YEARS AR MORE BEING SOCIALLY ISOLATED IS STRESSFUL AND ONE OF THE HALMARKED FEATURES OF SOCIAL ISOLATION IS CHRONICALLY ELEVATED STRESS HORMONES LIKE A DRENALIN ALSO CALLED EPINEPERAN LIKE CORTESALL A STRESS HORMONE THAT AT HEALTHY LEVELS IS GOOD FOR COMBATING INFLAMMATION HELPS US HAVE ENERGY EARLY IN THE DAY FOCUS THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT IF CORTESALL IS ELEVATED FOR TOO LONG WHICH IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF SOCIAL ISOLATION THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SUFFERS AND OTHER CHEMICALS STARE TO BE RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ARE DESIGNE TO MOTIVATE THE ORGANISM ANIMAL OR HUMAN TO SEEK OUT SOCIAL BONDS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE SUCH CHEMICAL IS A PEPTITE CALLED TAKI KINAN TAKI KINAN IS PRESENT IN FLIES IN MICE AND INHUMANS AND UNDER CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL ISOLATION ITS LEVELS GO UP AND BECAUSE OF THE BRAIN AREAS THAT CONTAIN RECEPTORS FOR TAKI KINAN PEOPLE START FEELING VERY AGGRESSIVE AND IRRITABLE AFTER SOCIAL ISOLATION NOW THAT SHOULD BE ELOBIT COUNTER INTUITIVE TO YU YOU WOULD THINK OH YOU KNOW IF YOU ISOLATE AN ANIMAL ARE OR HUMAN AND THEN YOU GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIAL INTERACTION THEY SHOULD BEHAVE VERY WELL THEY SHOULD BE THRILLED THEIR FINALLY GETTING THE NOURISHMENT THE SOCIAL NOURISHMENT THAT THEY'VE BEEN LACKING FOR SO LONG  TURNS OUT THATS NOT THE CASE CHRONIC SOCIAL ISOLATION CHANGES THE NATURE OF THE BRAIN AND BODY SUCH THAT IT MAKES SOCIAL CONNECTION HARDER AND IT MAKES THE PERSON WHO'S BEEN ISOLATED IRRITABLE EVEN AGGRESSIVE WITH OTHER PEOPLE NOW I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO DEEPLY INTO THE BIOLOGY OF SOCIAL ISOLATION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY AFFORD US THAT MUCH INSIGHT INTO WHAT HEALTHY SOCIAL BONDING LOOKS LIKE SO TODAY ORGAN A FOCUS MORE ON THE FUNCTIONAL BIOLOGY A DUAL MEANING OF THE WORD FUNCTIONAL AS OPPOSED TO THE PATHOLOGY OF SOCIAL ISOLATION HOWEVER I DO ONE O POINT OUT THAT SOCIAL ISOLATION STARTS TO DETERIATE SERTAIN ASPECTS OF BRAIN ND BODY PRETTY QUICKLY BUT HOW QUICKLY DEPENDS AGAIN ON HOW INTRVERTED OR EXTRAVERTED SOMEBODY IS SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO SOCIALLY ISOLATED FOR THE HOLODAYS OR HAS BEEN SOCIALLY ISOLATED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND IS CRAVING SOCIAL CONTACT THAT IS A HEALTHY CRAVING AND AS WILL LEARN NEXT THE HEALTHY CRAVING FOR SOCIAL CONTACT HAS A VERY SPECIFIC BRAIN CIRCUIT HAS A VERY SPECIFIC INEUR CHEMICAL SIGNATURE ASSOCIATED WITH AT AND HAS SOME REMARKABLE FEATURES THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE IN SOCIAL CONTACTS OF ALL KINDS I THINK SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT AND EXCITING WORK ON SOCIAL BOND AND COMES FROM THE LABORATORY OF CA TIE KA IS A PROFESSOR AT THE SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES SHE'S AN INVESTIGATOR WITH THE HOWARD HUGHE'S MEDICAL INSTITUTE AND IN RECENT YEARS OUS IN ABOUT THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS HER LABORATORY HAS MADE A FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY AS TO WHY WE SEEK OUT AND PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO SOCIAL BONDS AND THE KEY DISCOVERY THAT SHE MADE IS THAT MUCH LIKE HUNGER MUCH LIKE TEMPERATURE MUCH LIKE THIRST WE HAVE BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT ARE DEVOTED TO WHAT'S CALLED A SOCIAL HOMEOSTASIS MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT HOMEOSTACIS BEFORE HOMEOSTASIS IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL CIRCUITS AND EVEN INDIVIDUAL CELLS TO TRINE MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL 'S MOST EASILY THOUGHT OF IN THE CONTACT OF HUNGER YOU DON'T FOR A WHILE YOUR DRIVE TO PURSUE FOOD AND THINK ABOUT FOOD AND MAKE FOOD AND SPEND MONEY ON FOOD AND INDEED TO ENJOY FOOD GOES UP WHEREAS WHEN YOUR WELL FED YOU DON'T TEND TO SEEK OUT FOOD WITH AS MUCH VIGOR OR AS MUCH INTENSITY YOU WOULDN'T INVEST AS MUCH TIME EFFORT MONEY ET CETERA SO HOMEOSTACIS IS THE ASPECT OF CELLS TISSUES AN ORGANISMS TO SEEK SOME SORT OF BALANCE TO REGULATE THEMSELLS IN A CRUD WAY YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THE THERMASTAT ON YOUR HOME AS A HOMEOSTATIC CIRCUIT WHEN THE TEMPERATURE GOES UP A LITTLE BIT IT COOLS THINGS DOWN TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE WHEN THE ROOM GETS COLLED IT IT'S A CERTAIN A LEVEL AND A CENSER DETECTS THAT IT CLICKS ON AND THEN THE HEAT GOES ON TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN SET TEMPERATURE SO THAT'S A SIMPLE WAY OF THINK ABOUT HOMO STASIS EVERY HOMEOSTATIC CIRCUIT HAS THREE COMPONENTS OR AT LEAST THREE ONE IS A DETECTOR MEANING THE ORGANISM OR THE THERMASTAD ON YOUR WALL HAS TO HAVE SOME WAY OF DETECTING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ENVIRONMENT IGHT IN THE CONTACTS OF SOCIAL BONDING WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH OTHERS AND WHETHER NOT THOSE INTERACTIONS ARE GOING WELL SO THAT HAS TO BE DETECTED THAT'S THE FIRST THING THEN THERE AS TO BE A CONTROL CENTER THAT'S THE SECOND THING AND THE CONTROL CENTER IS THE ONE THAT MAKES THE ADJUSTMENTS TO IN THE CASE OF SOCIAL BONDING TO YOUR BEHAVIOR AND TO YOUR PSYCHOLOGY SOU SOON LEARN THAT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH THE MORE TIME THAT YOU SPEND ALONE THE MORE MOTIVATED YOU ARE TO SEEK OUT THE PICTURES OF FACES THE INTERACTIONS WITH ACTUAL PEOPLE PHYSICAL CONTACT AND SO FORTH NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS TO YOU BUT THANKS TO THE WORK OF CATI AND OTHERS IT'S REMARKABLE TO LEARN THAT THEIR SPECIFIC BRAIN CENTERES THAT ARE ADJUSTING OUR PSYCHOLOGY IN BIOLOGIES SO THAT WE SEEK OUT BONDS MORE AGGRESSIVELY OR MAYBE WE DON'T BECAUSE WE ARE PERFECTLY SATED OR SATIATED WITH RESPECT TO HOW MUCH CONTACT WE'VE HAD WITH OTHER PEOPLE NOW THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS HOMEOSTATIC CIRCUIT IS THE EFFECTOR THE EFFECTOR IS ACTUALLY WHAT DRIVES THE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE IS WHAT IT'S WHAT LEADS YOU TO PICK UP YOUR SOCIAL MEDIUM START SCROLLING IT'S WHAT LEADS YOU TO TEXT A FRIEND IT'S WHAT LEADS YOU TO CALL A FRIEND OR MAKE PLANS AND WHAT LEADS YOU TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THOSE PLANTS SO AGAIN THOSE THREE COMPONENTS ARE A DETECTOR A CONTROL CENTOR AND AN EFFECTOR AND AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN THE NERLE CIRCUIT THAT CONTROLS THE SOCIAL HOMEO STASIS ACTILY AS A FOURTH COMPONENT AND THAT FOURTH COMPONENT IS ONE THAT PLACES SUBJECTIVE UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND ESTABLISHES YOUR PLACE IN A HIERACHY NOW I KNOW THE WHORD HIERACHY CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A BARBED WIRE ONE BECAUSE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY START THINKING ABOUT BOSS AND SUBORDINATE OR IN COUPLES A LEADER AND A FOLLOWER BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL HIERACHES IN THE CONTECT OF HUMAN INTERACTIONS SOCIAL HIERACHEYS ARE VERY PLASTIC MEANING IN ONE SETTING ONE PERSON CAN BE THE LEADER IN ANOTHER SETTING THE OTHER PERSON CAN BE THE LEADER YOU PROBABLY HAVE GROUPS OF FRIENDS OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHERE YOURE CONSTANTLY PASSING THAT THE BATON AS TO WHO'SE GOIN A DRIVE WHO'SE GET A NAVIGATE WHO'SE GOING TO A PICK THE RESTAURANT WHO'SE GOING TO CLEAR THE DISHES AND WHO'SE GOING TO DO CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND NOT OTHERS SO HIERCHEYS ARE VERA DYNAMIC AND AS A CONSEQUENTE SOCIAL BONDING HAS TO BE VERY PLASTIC AND VERY FLUID SO THAT YOU MOVE FROM ONE ENVIRONMENT TO THE NEXT EVEN WITH THE SAINE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND IN THE CASE OF THE SOCIAL HOMEO STASIS CIRCUIT THOSE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE BY A PARTICULAR BRAIN STRUCTURE OF TALKED ABOUT IN THIS PODCAST BEFORE IT'S CALLED THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IT IS THE SEAT OF OUR HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS IF YOU WILL IT'S WHAT ALLOWS US TO PLACE SUBJECTIVE LABELS ON THINGS SO WE ARE NOT STRICTLY IMPUT OUTPUT WE ARE NOT ROBOTIC MEANING IF YOU GO TO DINNER WITH A FRIEND AND THEY ARE EXCEPTIONAL CHOOSING RESTAURANTS WELL IN THE CONTECTS OF THE SOCIAHOMEO STASIS CIRCUIT YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PICK THE RESTAURANT BECAUSE BASICALLY THEY ARE DOMINANT OVER YOU IN THEIR CAPACITY TO PICK GOOD RESTAURANTS AT LEAST IN THIS EXAMPLE WHEREAS AS YOU LEAVE THAT RESTAURANT AND PERHAPS YOU ARE NAVIGATING TO IH WHERE TO GET A DRINK AFTER DINNER OR WHERE TO WALK THROUGH THE CITY PERHAPS YOU HAVE THE BETTER SENSE OF DIRECTION AND SO THEN THE SOCIAL BONDING HAS TO BE MAINTAINED AS YOU SWITCH THE HIERCHY K SO THAT'S THE ROLL OF THAT FOURTH ELEMENT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX NOW I JUST BRIEFLY WANT A TOUCH ON SOME OF THE BRAIN AREAS THAT THANKS TO THE WORK OF CATI AND OTHERS WE NOW KNOW UNDERLIE THE DETECTION CONTROLL AND RESPONSE O CAN I CALL THEM THE DETECTOR CONTROL CENTER AN EFFECTOR BECAUSE INSIDE OF THAT DESCRIPTION ISN'T JUST A BUNCH AND NAMES OF NEURL STRUCTURES THERE ARE ALSO HINTS AS TO WHAT THE UNDERLYING NEROW CHEMICALS ARE AND BY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE NERL CHEMICALS ARE YOU CAN START TO THING ABOUT TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO FORM SOCIAL BONDS AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL BONDS IN BETTER HEALTHIER WAYS SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DETECTOR FIRST KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU HAVE YOUR SENSES YOU HAVE YOUR VISION YOU HAVE YOUR HEARING YOU HAVE TOUCH YOU HVE SMELL YOU HAVE TASTE SENSATION AS I TALKED ABOUT MANY TIMES WE FORM THE POTCAS BUT I'LL JUST REMIND YOU SENSATION IS THE CONVERSION OF PHYSICAL STIMULE IN THE ENVIRONMENT INTO ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THE LANGUAGE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS SO PHOTONS OF LIGHT ARE CONVERTED TO ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS PRESSURE ON THE SKIN WERE LIGHT TOUCH ON THE SKIN IS CONVERTED INTO ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO ALL OF THAT OF COURSE IS FLOWING INTO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT THE DETECTOR THAT UNDERLIES SOCIAL HOMEA STASIS INVOLVES MAINLY TWO STRUCTURES ONE IS CALLED THE A C C THE ENTEROR SINGULATE CORTEXS AND THE OTHER IS THE B LA BASILATERA LEMIGDULA AND WHEN YOU HAR THE WORD OF MIGDALA YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING FEAR BUT TO DAY AS YOU'LL SEE THE IMMIGALACTIALY HAS MANY DIFFERENT SUB COMPARTMENTS AND COMPONENTS AND THERE'S A REASON WHY THE BASILATERALOMIGULA WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF AVERSIVE BEHAVORS MEANING MOVING AWAY FROM SCERTAIN TYPES OF THINGS OR INTERACTIONS THERE'S A REASON WHY THE BIALE IS SUCH AN INTIGRAL PART OF THE DETECTOR SYSTEM AND THAT'S BECAUSE JUST AS ITS IMPORTANT TO FORM HEALTHY SOCIAL BONDS IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT TO TRY AN AVOID UNHEALTHY SOCIAL BONDS AND SO THE BASILATERAL MIGULA IS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AVERSIVE TYPE RESPONSES OF JUST MOVING AWAY FROM CERTAIN THINGS THE CONTROL CENTER IN THE SOCIALHOMEOSTASA CIRCUIT INVOLVES A BRAINARY CALLE THE LATERAL HYPOTHALMUS AND THE PARIVENTRICULAR HYPOTHALMUIS THE LATERAL HYPOTHALMUS AND THE PERIVENTRICULAR HYPOTHALMUS CONTAIN NURONS THAT ARE ABLE TO ACUS THE HORMONE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE OXY TOSEN WHICH IS A HORMON NEURO PEPTITE ITS KIND OF PART HORMONE PARTNER OR TRANSMITTER ITS KIND OF A HYBRID WERE GAN TO TALK A LOT ABOUT OXYTOSIN TODAY SO WE'VE GOT THE AC C IN THE BIALE THESE THERE AREAS TARE MAINLY INVOLVED IN MOVING AWAY FROM THINGS ALTHOUGH ALSO TOWARD THEM THAT'S THE DETECTOR THEN WEE GOT THE CONTROL CENTER WHICH IS IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS AND THEN THERE'S A VERY SPECIAL AND IMPORTANT AREA ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIAL BONDING THAT I WANT EVERY ONE TO LEARN WHICH IS THE DORSAL RAPE NUCLEUS S OR D R AN DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS IS A SMALL COLLECTION OF NURONS IN THE MID BRAIN SO ITS DEEP IN THE BRAIN AND MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT RAFE ARE A P H E BY THE WAY RAFE NUCLEUS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CERATONAN CERATONE IS A NEUROMODULATOR THAT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH FEELINGS OF SETIDY AFTER ETING WARMTH BASICALLY SATISFACTION WITH THINGS TAT YOU ALREADY HAVE HOWEVER WITHIN THIS DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS THERE IS A SMALL SEBSET OF NURONS THAT RELEASE DOPOMIE DOPOMING IS A NEUROMODULATOR MOST OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH MOVEMENT CRAVING MOTIVATION AND DESIRE AND THE NEURAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE RICH WITH DOPOMINE ARE THINGS LIKE THE SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA THE MESOLYMIC DOPOMINE SYSTEM THE VITIE THE NUCLEUS ACCOMMONS ET CETERA OF THOSE NAMES DON'T HAVE TO MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU HOWEVER THIS UNIQUE POPULATION OF DOPOMINURONS IN THE RAFE IS TRULY UNIQUE IN THAT IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MEDIATING WHAT IAVE BEEN CALLING SOCIAL HOMEOSTASIS IT IS THE EFFECTOR WERE THE RESPONSE THAT MEDIATES SOCIALHOMEOSTASIS NOW I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHAT SOCIAL HOMEO STASIS IS SOCIALHOMEOSTASIS JUST LIKE HUNGER IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH WHEN YOU LACK SOCIAL INTERACTION YOU START TO CRAVE IT WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEIRE DOPAMINE NURONS IN THIS RAPHE STRUCTSIRE THAT IS THE EFFECTOR FOR SOCIALHOMEOSTASIS IS THAT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE NOT INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE AT A FREQUENCY OR INTENSITY THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU DOPAMIN IS RELEASED IN TO THE BRAIN IN MOST POPULAR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DOPOMINE AND EVEN IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES WHEN YOU HEAR DOPAMINE RELEASE YOU THINK ABOUT REWARD OR FEELING GOOD BECAUSE INDEED MANY BEHAVIORS AND DRUGS OF ABUSE INCREASE DOPOMINE TSO ONE OF THE REASONS THEY HAVE SO MUCH ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL HOWEVER DOPAOMINE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH FEELING GOOD IT IS ACTUALLY THE NUUROCHEMICAL THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MOVEMENT TOWARD THINGS THAT FEEL GOOD SO TO ZUME OUT AND CONCEPTIALIZE WHAT WE HAVE HERE WE HAVE A BRAIN AREA THAT IS A DETECTOR THAT EITHER WILL MOVE US TORD OR AWAY FROM CERTAIN TYPES OF EXPERIENCES OR SENSATIONS WE HAVE A CONTROL CENTER THAT IS GOING TO RELEASE CERTAIN HORMONS AND EROPEPTIDES INTO OUR BRAIN AND BLOOD DEPENDING ON THE SORTS OF INTERACTIONS THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE HAVING AND WE HAVE THIS RESPONSE SYSTEM WHICH IS THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEAS THAT CONTAINS DOPAMI NURONS AND WHEN WE ARE NOT INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE AT THE FREQUENCY OR INTENSITY THAT WE CRAVE DOPAMIN IS RELEASED AND THAT DOPAMINE CAUSES US TO SEEK OUT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OF PARTICULAR KINDS SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT SOCIAL HOMEO STASIS IS AND HOW IT PLAYS OUT AND AGAIN LET'S USE HUNGER IS AN EXAMPLE SO LET'S SAY YOUARE A PERSON WHO EATS EVERY THREE OR FOUR HOURS REGULARLY SO ON MONDAY TUESDAY WHENSDAY THERE IS DAY YOU'RE JUST ACCUSTOMED TO EATING EVERY THREE OR FOUR HOURS IF JUST SUDDENLY I STEAL YOUR MEAL OUT OF THE FRIGE AT WORK SOMETHING I WOULD NOT DO BUT JUST FOR SAKE OF A MENTAL EXPERMENTATION THAT WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE YOU TO GO AND SEEK OUT FOOD THROUGH SOME OTHER ROUTE YOU MIGHT BY FOOD YOU PY BE UPSET FIRST BUT THEN YOU GO BY FOOD OR REPLACE THE FOOD THAT YOU ARE GOING TO EAT YOU BE HUNGRY FOR THAT FOOD AND INDEED THERE ARE HORMONAL TYPE MECHANISMS AND OTHER MECHANISMS THAT WHEN WE EAT REGULARLY AND WE PREDICT THAT FOOD IS COMING IN WE ACTUALY START SECRETING INSOLEN WHICH IS FOR MOBILIZING BLOOD SUGAR THEIR HORMONS IN THE BLOOD STREAM THAT MAKE US HUNGRY ON A REGULAR CLOCK LIKE STEDUAL AND YOU WOULD SEEK OUT MORE FOOD SIMILARLY IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO IS ACCUSTO TO A LOT OF SOCIAL INTERACTION AND SUDDENLY I TAKE AWAY THAT SOCIAL INTERACTION YOU WOULD FEEL KIND OF LET DOWN YOU WOULD CRAVE OF REPLACEMENT SOCIAL INTERACTION YOU MIGHT BE UPSET THAT YOU HAD A LUNCH STATE WITH A FRIEND YOU'RE USED TO HAVING LUNCH WITH THEM EVERY WEDNESDAY AND THEY CANCEL AND YOU WOULD CRAVE THE INTERACTION CAN THIS IS CALLED A PROSOCIAL CRAVING AND INDEED THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS IF YOU WHAT'S CALLED ACUTELY ISOLATE THEM WHICH IS JUST A FANCY SCIENTIFIC WORD OF SAYING DEPRIVE THEM OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND A SHORT TERM BASIS THEY START ENGAGING IN PROCSOCIAL BEHAVIORS THEY START TEXTING OTHER PEOPLE THEY START SEEKING OUT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OF DIFFERENT KINES THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE RIGHT BUT THOUGHT OF FROM THE DIFFERENT SIDE YOU COULD ALSO IMAGION HOW WELL IF YOU'RE GETTING A SOCIAL INTERACTION WITH SOMEBODY ON A DAILY OR WEEKLY BASIS AND SUDDENLY U REMOVED THAT INTERACTION WELL THEN  PEOPLE MIGHT NOT CARE AH THEY MIGHT JUST THINK WELL ILL GET THE INTERACTION TO MORROW OR THE NEXT YEAR THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE THERE THEY'RE SATED MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE PERSON WHO EATS VERY REGULARLY MIHT SAY WELL I ATE FOUR HOURS GO AN I'LL EAT EIGHT HOURS LATER NOBIG DEAL BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS THERE'S A PREDICTION THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SCERTAIN TYPES OF INTERACTIONS AND WHEN THOSE INTERACTIONS DON'T HAPPEN WE REPLACE THAT LACT OF INTERACTION WITH A DRIVE AN A MOTIVATION TO SEEK OUT SOCIAL INTERACTION AND THAT DRIVE IN MOTIVATION IT'S CAUSE BYOR I SHOULD SAY IS DRIVEN BY DOPEMINE RELEASE FROM THAT DOORCIAL RACTET AND SO THE TAKE WAY IS THAT WHEN WE LACK SOCIAL INTERACTION THAT WE EXPECT WE BECOME PROSOCIAL HOWEVER IF WE ARE CRONICALLY SOCIALLY ISOLATED MEANING WE DON'T HAVE INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME WE BECOME ACTUALLY MORE INTERVERTED THIS IS SEPARATE FROM ALL OF THE TACKI KIND AND STUFF THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER FALLING INTO STATES OF CHRONIC STRESS BUT IT'S WELL ESTABLISH NOW THAT IN HUMANS AND IN ANIMALS IF YOU DON'T GIVE THEM ENOUGH SOCIAL INTERACTION THEY ACTUALLY BECOME ANTISOCIAL AND SO THIS IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHAT MN ONE MIGHT SEE WITH LONG TERM FASTING K I GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF EATING EVERY FOUR HOURS NOW LET'S GIVE THE PARALLEL EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY WHOSE BEEN FASTING PERHAPS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS IF THEY ARE EXPECTING TO EAT AND THEN THE MEAL DOESN'NTERRIVE THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO IMMEDIATELY TRY AND SEEK OUT FOOD ND THAT'S A LOBIT COUNTERTUITIVE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WELL THEY HAVEN'T EATEN IN A E VERY LONG TIME THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY MOTIV AID TO SEEK OUT FOOD BUT NO THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO FASTING SIMILARLY THES SOCIALHOMEA STASIS CIRCUIT WORKS IN A WAY SUCH THAT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS FOR A VERY LONG TIME WE START TO LOSE OUR CRAVING FOR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS LET'S LOOK AT THE SOCIAHOMEA STATSIS CIRCUIT THROUGH THE LENDS OF WHAT'S COMMONLY CALLED INTRVERSION AND EXTRAVERSION NOW TYPICALLY WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT INTERVERTS WE THINK ABOUT THE QUIET PERSON AT THE PARTY OR THE PERSON THAT DOESN'T WANT TO GO OUT AT ALL  WE THINK ABOUT AN EXTRAVERT IS SOMEBODY WHOSE REALLY SOCIAL OF THE SO CALLED SOCIAL BUTTERFLY WHON J JOY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IS REALLY CHATTY IS CONN LIFE OF THE PARTY TYHE PERSON THAT'S THE CLICHE OR THE CONOFPOP PSYCHOLOGY CLICHE BUT ACTUALLY IN THE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE THAT'S NOT REALLY THE WAY IT HOLDS UP MANY PEOPLE WHO APPEAR INTRAVERTED ORE ACTUALLY EXTRAVERTED THE QUIET PERSON AN A PARTY COULD BE AN EXTRAVERT EXCEPT THAT THEY JUST DON'T TALK VERY MUCH THEY CHARACTERISTIC OF AN EXTRAVERT IS SOMEBODY THAT GETS ENERGY OR FEELS GOOD FROM SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THEY SORT OF GET A LIFT AND WE CAN PREDICT THAT THAT LIFT OCCURS BECAUSE OF SOME RELEASE OF DOPOMINE WITHIN THEIR BRAIN AND BODY AND INDEED THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR THAT NAROIMAGING STUDY SUPPORT THAT OTHER FORMS OF NERBIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS SUPPORT THAT IS WELL WE CAN ALSO IMAGINE THAT THE PERSON WHOSE TALKING A LOT IS SOMEBODY WHOSE VERY EXTRAVERTED BUT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO TALK A LOT FOR THEIR WORK OR THERE SOMEBODY WHOISE VERY SOCIAL WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH THEM THAT PERSON GETS BACK TO THEIR CAR AND IS ABSOLUTELY DEPLETED AND EXHAUSTED BY THAT INTERACTION OR ALSO SORTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS SO WE REALLY CAN'T PREDICT WHETHR NOT SOMEBODY IS AN INTRAVERT OR AN EXTRAVERT SIMPLY BASED ON THEIR BEHAVIOR IT'S REALLY MORE OF AN INTERNAL SUBJECTIVE LABEL HOWEVER IF WE LOOK AT INTRAVERSION IN EXTRAVERSION THROUGH THIS LENDS OF THE SOCIALHOMEOSTATIC SET POINT ND WE THINK ABOUT DOPOMINE AS THIS MOLECULE THAT DRIVES MOTIVATION TO SEEK OUT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WHAT WE CAN REASONABLY ASSUME IS THAT INTRVERTS OUR PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY ENGAGE IN CERTAIN FORMS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION EITHER THE AMOUNT OF DOPAOMINE THAT RELEASED IS GREATER THAN IT IS IN AN EXTRAVERT THAT'S RIGHT I SAID GREATER THAN IT IS IN AN EXTRAVERT AND SO THEY ACTUALLY FEEL QUITE MOTIVATED BUT ALSO SATISFIED BY VERY BRIEF OR WE COULD SAY A SORT OF SPARSE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THEY DON'T NEED A LOT OF SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT TO FEEL SATED AGAIN THE PARALOGUES AMPLE WOILL BE HUNGER THIS WOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T NEED TO EAT MUCH IN ORDER TO FEEL SAT IS FIED WHEREAS THE EXTRAVERT WE CAN REASONABLY ASSUME RELEASES LESS DOPOMINE IN RESPONSE TO AN INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL INTERACTION AND SO THEY NEED MUCH MORE SOCIAL INTERACTION IN ORDER TO FEEL FILLED UP BY THAT INTERACTION AND INDEED THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE NEROBIOLOGICAL IMAGING STUDIES SO RATHER THAN THING ABOUT INTRVERTS AND EXTRAVERTS AS CHATTY VERSIS QUIET IT'S USEFUL TO THINK ABOUT PEOPLE MAYBE YOURSELF MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW AS HOW MUCH SOCIAL INTERACTION THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BRING THIS SOCIAL HOMEA STACIS INTO BALANCE NOW THERE'S THE FOURTH COMPONENT OF THIS SOCIAL HOMEA STACI CIRCUIT THAT I MENTION BEFORE AND THAT'S THE PREFRONTAL PORTEX THE PREFRUNT OF QUARTECS IS INVOLVED IN THINKING AND PLANNING AND ACTION AND HAS EXTENSIVE CONNECTIONS WITH AREAS OF THE BRAIN LIKE THE HYPOTHALYMUS WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOT OF MOTIV ATED DRIVES IT ALSO AS CONNECTIONS WITH THE VERIOUS REWARD CENTRS OF THE BRAIN AND IT CAN ACT AS KIND OF AN ECCELERATOR MEANING IT CAN INCOURAGE MORE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF OF OTHER BRAIN CENTER 'S OR AS A BREAK ON THOSE BRAIN CENTERS REALLY GOD EXAMPLE 'SKOND OF A TRIVIAL ONE IN THE CONTEXTS OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION BUT IT'S A CONCRETE ONE SALL USE IT WOULD BE I KNOW MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE YOUSE COLD SHOWERS AS A WAY TO STIMULATE METABOLISM AND BUILD UP RAZILIANS IN THES SORT OF THING IF YOU GET INTO A VERY COLD SHOWER AND YOU FEEL AS IF YOU WANT TO GET OUT WHAT YOU FORCE YOURSELF TO STAY IN YOU'RE FORCING YOURSELF TO STAY IN BECAUSE YOUR PREFRUNTAL QUARTEX IS PLACING SOME SUBJECTIVE LABEL ON THAT EXPERIENCE EITHER YOU'RE DOING IT FOR A CERTAIN BENEFIT OR AM YOU'VE GOT A TIMER AND YOU'RE USING THE TIMER AS THE REGULATOR OF HOW LONG YOU'RE GIN A STAY IN BHEY SEE OU'RE OVER RIDING REFLEXES AND THAT'S THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE PREFRNTAL QUARTEX BUT AS I MENTIONE EARLIER THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX COMPONENTS THAT WIRE INTO THE SOCIAHOMEASTASIS CIRCUIT OUR RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATING WHERE YOU ARE IN A GIVEN HIERKEY AND THAT AFFORDS YOU A TONIFLEXIBILITY INTERMS OF THE TYPES OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN AND WHETHER NOT YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND TIME WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE OR NOT WHETHER NOT YOU'RE GOING T ENGAGE AND THAN DISENGAGE WHAT DO I MEAN BY THIS WELL LET' SAY YOU'RE AN EXTRAVERTED PERSON YOU'RE SOMEBODY THAT LIKES A LOT OF SOCIAL INTERACTION AND YOU GET A LOT OF DOPOMINE RELEESE ON WHOLE FROM A LOT OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS O MAYBE ONE INTERACTION WITH A TELLER AT THE SUPERMARCET IS IN'T REALLY GON GIVE YOU MUCH DOPOMINE BUT GOING TO A PARTY WILL GIVE YOU MORE DOPOMINE UNSO YOU SEEK OUT THESE THESE LARGER SOCIAL INTERACTIONS HOWEVER YOU MIGHT GO TO A PARTY WHERE SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING OR YOU SEE SOMEBODY THERE THAT YOUD MUCH PREFER NOT TO SEE AND THEREFORE YOU DECIDE TO LIEVE THE DECIDING TO LEAVE IS REGULATED BY THAT PREFRONTAL QUARTEX COMPONENT SO IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A HOMEOSTATIC CIRCUIT THAT INVOLLS AREAS LIKE THE IMIGDOLA AND THE HYPOTHALEMUS IN THESE DEEP BRAIN REGIONS LIKE THE DORSOL RAFEY AS A HUMAN BEING YOU AFFLEXIBILITY OVER YOUR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND THAT FLEXIBILITY ARISE FROM THOSE PREFRONTAL CIRCUITS SO THERE'S A TONOF SUBJECTIVE NATURE TO IT THERE'S A LOT OF CONTEX TO IT SO WHILE THERE ARE SOME PREDICTIBLE ELEMENTS OF THESE CIRCUITS THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY WHAT WE CALL PLOGAN SHUG YOU HAVE FLEXIBILITY YOU ARE ABLE TO SAY YOU NOT I LOVE PARTIES BUT I REALLY DON'T WAN TO GO TO THAT PARTY BECAUSE SO AND SO IS THERE OR I VERY MUCH DON'T LIKE GOING ACROSS TOWN IN TRAFFIC BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT TO DAY BECAUSE A CERTAIN COLLECTION F PEOPLE OR PORAPS A CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL WILL BE AT THAT PARTICULAR PARTY AND SO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS AGAIN IS WHAT ALLOWS YOU THAT SUBJECTIVE RULING OR RULING OVER WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE JUST BE REFLEXES SO NOW I'D LIKE TO DRILL A LITLE BIT DEEPER INTO THIS INCREDIBLE NARL STRUCTURE THAT IS THE DORSAL RAFE NUCLEUS AND THIS SMALL COLLECTION OF NURANS THE DOPOMINERANS OF THE DORSAL RAFE BECAUSE WHILE IT'S A SMALL COLLECTION THEY ARE VERY POWERFUL LONELINESS HAS BEEN DEFINED BY THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGIS JOHN CASSIOPO AS THE DISTRESS THAT RESULTS FROM DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN IDEAL AND PERCEIVE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS LET ME RE PEAT THAT LONELINESS IS NOT JUST BEING ISOLATED LONELINESS AS HE DEFINES IT IS THE DISTRESS THAT RESULTS FROM DISCREPAN D SEES BETWEEN IDEAL AND PERCEIVE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS IT'S WHEN WE EXPECT THINGS TO BE ONE WAY AND THEIR ACTIALLY ANOTHER WAY AND WHICH WAY WE EXPECT THEM TO BE AND WHICH WAY THEY TURN OUT AGAIN IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM FRIENDSHIPS AND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE EXPECT FROM FRIENDSHIPS CON BE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BUT THE CIRCUIT THAT UNDERLIES FRIENDSHIP BONDING IS EXACTLY THE SAME AND IT IS THIS DORSAL RAFE NUCLEUS AND THE DOPAMINURONS IN THAT NUCLES THAT UNDERLIE THE BOND THAT IS SOCIAL FRIENDSHIP AND ALL TYPES OF SOCIAL BONDS THERE'S A KEY FINDING IN THE LITERATURE THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS DORSAL RAFE DOPAMINURONS REPRESENT THE EXPERIENCE OF SOCIAL ISOLATION AS THE PAPER FROM CATIES LAB THE FIRST AUTHOR IS MATTHEWS GILIAN MATTHEWS TO BE SPECIFIC WHAT THEY DID IS THEY WERE ABLE TO SELECTIVELY ACTIVATE THE DOPAMI NURONS IN THE DORCIAL RAFE NUCLEUS AND WHEN THEY DID THAT THEY INDUCED A LONELINESS LIKE STATE NOW HOW DID THEY KNOW IT WAS A LONELINESS LIKE STATE THEY KNEW BECAUSE IT MOTIVATED THE SEEKING OUT OF SOCIAL CONNACTIONS THIS IS THE KIND OF SOCIAL HUNGER THAT I WAS REFERRING TO BE FOR WHEREAS WHEN THE DOPAMI NURONS OF THE DORCIAL RAFE ARE INHIBITED MEANING THEIR ACTIVITY IS QUIETED THAT SUPPRESSED A LONELINESS STATE THAT'S A LITTLE COUNTER INTUITIVE RIGHT IT'S A GROUP OF NURONS THAT WHEN ACTIVATED MAKES YOU FEEL LONELY AND WHEN THIS BRAINARY IS NOT ACTIVATED IT SUPPRESSIS LONELINESS BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF CIRCUIT THAT YOU WOULD WANT IN ORDER TO DRIVE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WHEN YOUR FEELING LONELY DOPAMINE IS RELEASED AND IT CAUSES YOU TO GO OUT AND SEEK SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WHEN THIS BRAIN AREA HAS ENOUGH SOCIAL INTERACTIONS A SORT OF A FIGURE OF SPEECH BRAINARIES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SOCIAL INTERACTIONS BUT WHEN ENOUGH SOCIAL INTERACTIONS HAVE HAPPENED THAT THE NURONS IN THIS BRAINARIS SHUT DOWN THEIR PRODUCTION OF DOPAMINE WELL THE LONELINESS STATE TURNS OFF SO WHAT WE THINK OF AS LONELINESS AS THIS BIG KIND OF DARK CLOUD OR OR YOU KNOW FOG IN OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE BOILS DOWN TO A VERY SMALL SET OF NURONS RELEASING ITS PECIFIC NEROCHEMICAL FOR MOTIVATION AND TO ME THIS REALLY CHANGES THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT LONELINESS AND THAT WE THINK ABOUT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THERE SO MUCH SUBJECTIVE LANDSCAPE TO LONELINESS AND TO SOCIAL INTERACTIONS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT IT REALLY IS IS THAT WE ARE ALL SOCIAL ANIMALS TO SOME EXTENT OR ANOTHER AND WE ALL CRAVE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS TO SOME EXTENT OR ANOTHER ALTHOUGH THE EXTENT WILL VERY DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE INTRVERSION EXTRVERSION CONTINUU AND IT IS INDEED A CONTINUAL NOW THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE STUDY THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT GETS BACK TO THAT ISSUE OF HIERCHY AND SOCIAL RANK BUT THEY FOUND IS THAT DEPENDING ON WERE YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE SOCIAL RANK THE DOPAMI NURONS IN THE RAFE WILL LEAD TO ONE CONSEQUENCE OR ANOTHER MEANING MOVING TOWARD SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OR MOVING AWAY FROM THEM SO THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS SET UP SO THAT YOU HAVE A T ON A FLEXIBILITY IN CONTROL OVER SOCIAL INTERACTIONS SO JUST A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS AND ACTIONABLE TAKE AWAYS BASED ON THE INFORMATION I HAVE OFFERED UP UNTIL NOW IF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS AN INTROVERT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT YOU GET A LOT OF DOPOMINE FROM A FEW OR MINIMAL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WHEREAS IF YOUARE NEXTRAVERT CONTRARY TO M WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ARE NOT IN A FLOODYOUR SYSTEM WITH DOPOMIE THEY ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO LEAD TO LESS DOPOMNE RELEASE THAN IT WOULD FOR AN INTROVERT AND THEREFORE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN ORDER TO FEEL FILLED UP BY THOSE INTERACTIONS NOT BEEN DRAWING A LOT OF PARALLELS BETWEEN THIS SOCIAL SEEKING OR AVOIDING SOCIAL ISOLATION AND HUNGER BUT IS THAT REALLY THE CASE AND COULD IT BE THAT THERE RE ACTULLY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DRIVES MEANING COULD SOCIAL ISOLATION OR THE DESIRE TO SEEK OUT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ACTUALLY RELATE TO THE HUNGER SYSTEM AND VICE VERSA AND INDEED THE ANSER IS YES WE DON'T HAVE FIFTY DIFFERENT HOMEOSTATIC SYSTEMS AND FIFTY DIFFERENT NEURO CHEMICALS TO UNDERLY OUR DRIVE TO EAT OUR DRIVE FOR ROMANTIC INTERACTIONS OUR DRIVE FOR FRIENDSHIP INTERACTIONS WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY ONE MAY BE TOO AND THEY ALL FUNNL IN TO THIS SAME DOPOMINE SYSTEM AND THRE'S A BEAUTIFUL PAPER THAT ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT HOMEOSTATIC DRIVES THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS ACUTE SOCIAL ISOLATION EVOKES MIDBING CRAVING RESPONSES SIMILAR TO HUNGER IS THAT FROM REBECCA SAXES LAB AT AMITI MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY DOCTOR CATI IS ALSO AN AUTHOR ON THIS PAPER THE PAPERS PUBLISH IN NATURE NERO SCIENCE ITS ARE REALLY TERRIFIC PAPER JUST A BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE WHAT THEY DID THEY TOOK PEOPLE THAT WERE CATEGRIZED AS SOCIALLY CONNECTED HEALTHY HUMAN ADULTS O THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE USED TO PRETTY FREQUENT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND THEY SOCIALLY ISOLATED THEM FOR ABOUT TEN HOURS AND THEY HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO  ACCS ESS SOCIAL MEDIA EMALE FICTION READING EVEN A AND CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE FACE TO FACE SO WHAT THIS DID IS IT INCREASE SOCIAL CRAVING BOTH SUBJECTIVELY THE PEOPLE SAID THAT THEY WERE NOW CRAVING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND THEN THEY DID BRAIN IMAGING IN RESPONSE TO IMAGES OF PEOPLE PEOPLE INTERACTING FOOD FLOWERS OTHER TYPES OF STIMULE SOME OF THE STIMULE OR THESE IMAGES WE CALL THEM STIMULE BUT THEIR IMAGES REALLY A HAD A LOT OF SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT GOING ON IN THEM OTHERS DID NOT SOMEWHERE HAD A LOT OF FACES SHOWING OTHERS DID NOT AND AS YOU MIGHT SUSPECT THERE WAS ACTIVATION OF MANY OF THE BRAINAIR IS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER DOR SO RAPHE NUCLEUS AND OTHER BRAINAIRS ASSOCIATED WITH DOPOMANURGECNURONS WHEND THE SOCIALLY ISOLATED PEOPLE VIEWED SOCIAL CUES PEOPLE INTERACTING FACES AND SO ON AND LESS SO FOR THINGS LIKE FLOUERS HOWEVER THEY ALLSO HAD INCREASED RESPONSES TO IMAGES OF FOOD WHICH IS INTERESTING AND ACTUALLY IS CONSYSTENT WITH THE LITERATURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE SOCIALLY ISOLATED THEY OFTEN WILL START EATING MORE OR THEY WILL CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE FOODS THAT THEY EAT NOW WE THINK OF THAT AS COMFORT FOODS OR SOOTHING ONESELF THROUGH THROUGH EATING RATHER THAN SOCIAL INTERACTION AS A KIND OF PATHOLOGY BUT WHILE IT MAGHT NOT BE HEALTHY DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT IN THE PERSON IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT T UNDERSTAND THAT THE REASON THAT HAPPENS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A COMMON CIRCUIT AND THAT THE SYSTEM MEANING THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY CRAVING DOPAMIN RELEASE THEY DON'T CONSCIOUSLY KNOW THIS IS ALSO CONSCIOUSLY CARRIED OUT BUT THE RAVING DOPAMIN RELEASE AND IF THEY CAN'T GET IT FROM SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AS THEY NORMALLY WOULD THEY'LL START SEEKING IT FROM FOOD NOW THEY DID AN IMPORTANT REVERSE EXPERIMENT AS WELL WHERE THEY HAD SUBJECTS GO ON TEN HOURS OF FOOD FASTING NOW THESE WERE NOT PEOPLE THAT WERE FAMILIAR WITH FASTING THEY WEREN'T ON DOING INTERMITTANT FASTING THEY WERE EATING MORE TYPICAL MEAL SCEDUALS AND SO THAT CREATED INCREASED HUNGER ET CETERA BUT IT ALSO INCREASED THEIR APPETITE IF YOU WILL FOR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND SO TE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS THAT THERE'S A COMMON BIOLOGY THERE'S A COMMON CIRCUITRY THAT UNDERLIES HOMEOSTATIC CRAVING OF THINGS THAT MAINTAIN US AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A SPECIES AND IT REALLY PLACES SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AS RIGHT UP THERE IN THE LIST OF THINGS THAT WE CONSIDER SO VITAL FOR OUR SURVIVAL AND FOR OUR HEALTH THINGS LIKE FOOD WATER SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ARE REALLY SIT WITHIN A TOP TEER AMONGST EACH OTHER AND THEY USE THE SAME COMMON CIRCUITRY DORSAL RAPHA DOPAMINERONS INADDITION TO OTHER STRUCTURES IN ORDER TO CREATE THIS DRIVE TO SEEK OUT CERTAIN TYPES OF STIMULE NOW THIS IS A VERY REDUCTIONIST VIEW OF SOCIAL BONDING I REALIZE THAT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT WHILE WE PLACE ALL THE SUBJECTIVE CONTEXT OH I MISS THIS PERSON OR I I YOU KNOW OR I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO AVOID THAT PERSON AT THE END OF THE DAY IT REALLY ALL FUNNELS IN TO A SYSTEM WHEREBY A SINGLE NEROCHEMICAL IS EITHER BEING RELEASED AND MODIVATING US TO SEEK OUT MORE OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF INTERACTION OR IS NOT RELEASED AND THEREFORE WE ARE PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE STHAING EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE AS I SAY THIS SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY THINKING OH THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE AND INDEED THAT'S THE CASE WHEN PEOPLE ENTER ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT TO THEM ARE VERY SATISFYING THERE'S THIS PERIOD THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE THEORY IS THAT IT LAST ANYWHERE FROM SIX DAYS TO SIX MONTHS ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE REPORT THAT THIS FEELING CAN LAST MANY MANY YEARS EVEN DECADES OF JUST FEELING COMPLETELY FILLED UP AND SATED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING WITH THAT PERSON SO MUCH SO THAT CRAVINGS FOR FOOD ARE REDUCED CRAVINGS FOR SLEEP ARE REDUCED NOW THERE'S ALL SORTS OF ACTIVITIES AND THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH NEW ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIPS THAT TAKE UP TIME THAT MIGHT GET IN THE WAY OF THINGS LIKE SLEEP OR THINGS LIKE FOOD BUT THE POINT IS THAT DOPOMINE IS THE FINAL COMMON PATHWAY BY WHICH WE SEEK OUT THINGS AND WE END UP FEELING AS IF WE ARE SATISFIED BY CERTAIN TYPES OF INTERACTIONS NOW SIMILARLY IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN ISOLATED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME YOUR FOCUS MIGHT HAVE SHIFTED TO WHAT YOU'REGOING TO EAT WHAT YOUREGOING TO COOK FOR DINNER IN A MUCH MORE HEIGHTENED WAY THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE SENSORY STIMULE IN THOSE TYPES OF INTERACTIONS AND INDEED THE TASTE OF FOOD ITSELF EXPANDS SO NORMALLY WHEN WE ARE IN SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE A ONES THAT ARE FAMILIAR TO US WE HAVE A BALANCE OF THESE DIFFERENT DRIVES BUT WHEN ONE PARTICULAR DRIVE TAKES OVER AND WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON IT BECAUSE THEY ALL FUNNAL INTO THE SAME CIRCUITRY THERE REALLY ISN'T THE SEEKING OUT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF BEHAVIORS LIKE FOOD SEEKING WHEN WE'RE NEWLY IN LOVE NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT FOOD WON'T TASTE GOOD TO US SO THAT WE DON'T SEEK IT INDEED THEIR EXPERIMENTS THATHAVE BEEN DONE WHERE IF PEOPLE HAVE JUST FALLEN AND LOVE THE TASTE OF A STRAWBERRY CAN JUST BE INCREDIBLE THE OTHER EFFECT IF DOPOMINE IS THAT IT CHANGES THE WAY THAT WE INTERPRATE SENSORY STIMULA ARE DETECTORS S ACTUALLY CHANGE WHEN WE ARE IN HEIGHTENED STATES OF DOPAMIN URGIC ACTIVITY OR DRIVE BASILY WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THINGS SEEM BETTER THAN THEY WOULD WHEN WE HAVE LESS DOPAMINE IN OUR SYSTEM THE POINT HERE IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CROSS OVER THERE'S A LOT OF MESHING TOGETHER OF DIFFERENT HOMEESTATIC DRIVES THAT THEY DON'T EXIST IN SEPARATE CHANNELS AND IT'S ONLY UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH ONE PARTICULAR HOMOSTATIC DRIVE IS KIND OF BEING PLAYED OUT TO THE EXTREME SUCH AS THE EXAMPLE FALLING IN LOVE THAT WE TEND TO AVOID OR SORT OF OVERLOOK THE OTHER HOMEESTATIC DRIVES AND THAT'S BECAUSE SIMPLY WERE GETTING ENOUGH DOPAMINE WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE UP UNTIL NOW I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC OF SOCIAL BONDING WHICH IS REALLY JUST NERVES SPEAK FOR HOW IS IT THAT WE FOREIM BONDS AVOID BONDS WHATHER PEOPLE SEEK OUT MORE OR FEWER BONDS THAN OTHERS ET CETERA NOW I'D LIKE TO SHIFT YEARS A BIT AND FOCUS ON WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE THE FORMATION OF HEALTHY BONDS THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN SELL REPORT SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THE TITLE OF THIS PAPERIS CONSCIOUS PROCESSING OF NARRATIVE STIMULE SYNCHRANIZES HEARTRATE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS I MENTION THIS ON A PREVIOUS PODCAST BUT I LIKE TO MENTION IT AGAIN AND GOING TO ELOBIT MORE DEPTH BECAUSE IT POINTS TO SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE ITEMS THAT WE CAN ALL USE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY AND DEPTH OF SOCIAL BONDS OF ALL KINDS NOW THE STUDY INVOLVED A VERY SIMPLE TYPE OF EXPERIMENT THEY HAD PEOPLE LISTEN TO A STORY EVERYBODY IN THE STUDY LISTEN TO THE SAME STORY BUT THEY LISTEN TO THAT STORY AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND INDEED IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS SO DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAME STORY AND THEY MEASURED THINGS LIKE HEARTRAHT THEY MEASURED BREATHING ET CETERA NOW WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION FOR DOING THIS BUT THERE'S A LONG TENDING LITERATURE SHOWING THAT OUR PHYSIOLOGY THINGS LIKE OUR HEART RATE ARE BREATHING OUR SKIN CONDUCTANS MEANING THE AMOUNT OF SWEATING CAN BE SYNCHRONIZED BETWEN INDIVIDUALS AND THAT SYNCRANIZATION CAN OCCUR R ACCORDING TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS THERE BEEN STUDIES THAT HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER AND THEY LOOK AND ACTUALLY SEE THAT THEIR PUPIL SIZE OF THEIR EYES STARTS TO SYNCHRONIZE PEOPLE'S BREATHING CONSYNCHRONIZE PEOPILS A BODY TEMPERATURES CAN EVEN START TO SYNCHRONIZER AT LEAST SHIFTS IN BODY TEMPERATURE CAN SYNCHONIZE ONE PERSON GETS COOLER THE OTHER PERSON GETS COOLER A LOT OF THIS IS SUBCONSCIOUS SOME OF IT CAN BE DETECTED BY CONSCIOUS CUSES LIKE FLUSHING OF THE SKIN ARE ACTUALLY SEEING SOME ONE'S PUPILS CHANGE BUT ACTUALLY THE PUPIL REFLEX AS A REALLY GOD EXAMPLE WHEREBY EXCEPT FOR RARE CASES AND CERTAIN HIGHLY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS MOST PEOPLE CAN'T CONTROL THEIR PUPIL REFLEXES IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY ITS TRULY A REFLEXETS AN AUTONOMIC REFLEX SO THERE'S A LOT OF LITURE SHOWING THAT WITHIN SMALL GROUPS ARE TWO PEOPLE THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS CAN BE SYNCHRONIE WHAT THIS STUDY FOUND WAS THAT WHEN PEOPIL LISTEN TO THE SAME STORY BUT AT DIFFERENT TIMES THEIR HEART RATES STARTS TO SYNCHRONIZE THIS IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THE STORY AT DIFFERENT TIMES BUT THE GAPS BETWEEN THEIR HEART BEATS BECOME VERY STEREOTYPE AND MAP ALMOST PRECISELY ON TO ONE ANOTHER THAT'S INCREDIBLE NOW WE ALSO KNOW FROM AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE THAT THE QUALITY AND PERCEIVED DEPTH OF A SOCIAL BOND CORRELATES VERY STRONGLY WITH HOW MUCH PHYSIOLOGICAL SYNCHRANIZATION THERE IS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOUR BODIES FEEL THE SAME YOU TEND TO FEEL MORE BONDED TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND SO THIS WHOLE THING IS AS RATHER CIRCULAR ARGUMENT WHEN YOU FEEL CLOSER TO SOMEBODY ELSE YOUR PHYSIOLOGY SYNCHRONIZE AND THE REVERSE IS TRUE AS WELL WHEN YOUR PHYSIOLOGIES ARE SYNCHRANIZE YOU FEEL CLOSER TO OTHER PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE CONCERT PHENOMENON IF YOU EVER GO TO SEE YOUR FAVORITE A BAND OR YOU GO TO A CONCER THAT YOU PARTICULARLY LOVE YOU WILL OFTEN LOOK OVER AT SOMEBODY AND YOU'LL SEE THEM ENJOYING THE SAME THING AND THERE OFTEN IN A SIMILAR STATE AS YOU ARE MAYBE THE THE SORTF LIKE FAVORITE SONG COMES ON AND YOU ACTHALL FEEL CONNECTED TO THAT PERSON YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A SHARED EXPERIENCE BUT THERE'S ALSO A SHARED PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THAT EXPERIENCE AND SO THIS CAN HAPPEN AND MASS WITH LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE OR IT CAN HAPPEN JUST BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS AND AS THE STUDY POINTS OUT IT CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT THEM ACTUALY INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER WHEN THE STORY THEY ARE LISTENING TO IS THE ANCHOR OR THE DRIVER OF THEIR PHYSIOLOGY THIS REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE BODY AND THE BRAIN ARE RECYPRICALLY CONNECTED YES INDEED WHAT WE THINK WHAT WE HEAR WHAT WE FEEL DRIVES OUR PHYSIOLOGY OUR HEART BEAT AR RESPIRATION ET CETERA BUT OUR HEARTBEATEN RESPIRATION ALSO ARE INFLUENCING ARE STATE OF MIND AND IN THIS CASE IT'S ENCOURAGING CERTAIN TYPES OF SOCIAL BONDS WHEN OUR HEART RATES ARE SYNCHRONIED YOU CAN LEVERAGE THIS HOW CAN YOU LEVERAGE THIS WELL LET'S TAKE A UPCOMING EXAMPLE OF THE HOLIDAYS THERE'S A A A SORT OF A JOKE AM I THINK IT AS ROMDAS EM SORT OF BUT HIS PHILOSOPHER TYPE A THAT SAID A IF YOU THINK YOU'RE ENLIGHTENED GO VISIT YOUR PARENTS AND I THINK WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO IS THAT SOME PEOPLE NOT ALL PEOPLE HAVE CHALLENGING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR PARENTS OR CAN O TALK ABOUT CHILD PARENT A ATTACHMENT AND INTERACTIONS AND A FEW MINUTES BUT YE SOME PEOPLE HAVE A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP TO BOTH THEIR PARENTS AND MORE POWER TO THEM I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S WONDERFUL WE SHOULD ALL BE SO LUCKY MANY PEOPLE HAVE CHALLENGED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR PARENTS OR THEYHAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PARENTS BUT THEIR PARENTS KNOW OR THEY KNOW HOW TO DRIVE THAT DART RIGHT INTO THAT PARTICULAR SOFT PIECE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FLESH BY SAYING THAT JUST THE SLIGHTEST THING OR EVEN BY RAISING THEIR EYEBROW R ROLLING THEIR EYES OR THE TONE IN WHICH THEY DO SOMETHING THIS IS ALSO TRUE BETWEEN SIBLINGS I THINK MANY OF YOUR CAN THINK OF EXAMPLES WHERE THIS IS TRUE MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH OTHERS EXPECT THAT THE MERE INTERACTION WITH THEOTHER PERSON IS GOING TO CREATE THE SENSE OF BONDING AND OFTEN THAT IS THE CASE FOR INSTANCE IF PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN INTIMATE DISCLOSURE IF PEOPLE ENJOY A THEIR EACH OTHERS COMPANY SO MUCH THAT JUST THE MERE SIGHT OF SOMEBODY EVOKES GREAT FEELINGS AND ITS MUTUAL THAT OFTEN CAN HAPPEN BUT IN MANY TYPES OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IT'S NOT THE DIRECT INTERACTION WITH THAT PERSON THAT MAKES US FEEL CLOSE TO THEM BUT RATHER IT SHARED EXPERIENCE AND SHARED EXPERIENCE IS SHARED PHYSIOLOGY THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE BY WAY OF THI STUDY OFBOUT CONSCIOUS PROCESSING OF NARRATIVE STIMULA STYNCHRONIZES HEARTRATE OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A SOMEWHAT CHALLENGED OR SOMEWHAT A LET'S CALL IT A A SLIGHT FRICTION IN GETTING CLOSE WITH SOMEBODY OR IT CAN BE A CHALLENGING INTERACTION OFTENTIMES IT'S VERY USEFUL TO FOCUS OUTWARD ON SOME OTHER COMMON NARRATIVE A MOVI OFTENTISES PEOPLE WLL WATCH A GAME TOGETHER ACTUALLY THRE'S A LOT OF A CRITIQUE THAT A PEOPLE OR FAMILIES WILL FOCUS OUTWARD TOO MUCH ON EXTERNAL EVENTS BUT THESE EXTERNAL EVENTS CAN BE OBSERVING THE GRANDCHILD THAND HOW WONDERFUL THEY ARE OR OBSERVING THE MEAL AND HOW WONDERFUL IT IS OR AS WE COMMONLY SEE IN VARIOUS TRADITIONS THERE IS A STORY THAT S REPEATED EACH YEAR CERTAINLY IN THE UPCOMING HOLIDAYS THERES CHRISTMAS STORIES THEIR THEIRE THEMES AND TRADITIONS AND THOSE THEMES AND TRADITIONS ANCHOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR PSYCHOLOGY THEIRE REALLY WONDERFUL THEY THREAD THROUGH A THE AGES REALLY AND ALLOW US TO LINK OUR OWN EXPERIENCES UP WITH PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AND EXPERIENCES BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY SYNCHRONIZE OUR PHYSIOLOGIES AND SO SOMETIMES IT CAN BE USEFUL RATHER THAN EXPECTING OTHERS TO SHIFT OUR PHYSIOLOGY IN THE WAY THAT WE WISH OR US SHIFTING THEIR PHYSIOLOGIES IN THE WAY THAT WE WISH AND THEN EXPECTING SOME BOND TO MUSHROOM OUT OF THAT IN SOME BEAUTIFUL WAY TO FOCUS ON SOME EXTERNAL STIMULUS TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING THAT WILL SYNCHRONIZE THE PHYSIOLOGIES OF BOTH PEOPLE THAT CAN ACT AS A BRIDGE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH SOCIAL BONDS AND TH IS IS NOT A HACK OR A WORK AROUND FOR MAKING TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIPS GOOD THIS IS ACTUALLY AT THE SEAT OF WHAT WE COME AWAY FROM A SOCIAL INTERACTION WITH AS FEELING HOW THAT WAS A REALLY WONDERFUL TIME OFTEN A REALLY WONDERFUL TIME CAN BE BY VIRTUE OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WERE SAID OR THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ONE ENGAGED IN BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE FINAL COMMON PATHWAY WE SHOULD SAY OF GREAT EXPERIENCES WAS A GREAT PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE AND A SHARED PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE I HAVE A SHORE ANECDOTE THAT RELATES TO THIS I'VE AN OLDER SIBLING AND SHE IS TO SAY THAT WHEN SHE WAS IN COLLEGE THE BEST DATES THAT SHE EVER WENT ON WERE DATES WHERE OF SHE WAS ASKED TO GO OUT AND LISTEN TO MUSIC SHE POINTED OUT HOWEVER THAT OFTEN TIMES OF THE GUIES THAT WOULD ASK HER OUT WOULD TAKE HER TO JA CLUBS SHE ALWAYS HAD THE THEORY THAT THE WOULD ASK HER TO JAS CLUBS BECAUSE IT JASCLUBS TYPICALLY YOU WOULD SIT DOWN AND THEN SHE HAD TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY COULDN'T DANCE A MY SISTER LIKES TO DANCE AND SO ANY TIME SO ONE ACTUALLY HAD THE NERVE TO TAKE HER DANCING THOSE OM TURNED OUT TO BE PARTICULARLY OF LESS SOU SAY SATISFYING DATES AND RELATIONSHIPS AT LEAST THEY LASTED LONGER THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT THEM THAT'S ALL I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM THE SHES MY SISTER AFTER ALL BUT THE THEORY BEHIND WHOEVER WAS ASKING HER OUT ON THESE DATES  AS IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE WHICH IS THAT IF YOU WANT A BOND WITH SOMEBODY YOU CREATE A COMMON PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE THROUGH A COMMON AND SHARED EXPERIENCE AND THAT IS OFTEN A GOOD ENTRY WAY INTO ESTABLISHING WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ALWAYS A QUESTION WHETHER NOT THERE CAN BE COMMON PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE BETWEEN TO INDIVIDUALS UP UNTIL NOW WE'V BEEN TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL BONDING THROUGH THE LENS OF NERL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED HOWEVER EARLY IN THE EPISODE I MENTION THAT THESE VERY NERL CIRCUITS T AR RESPONSIBLE FOR SOCIAL BONDING IN ADULT FORMS OF ATTACHMENT BE IT ROMANTIC OR FRIENDSHIP OR OTHERWISE ARE ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED DURING DEVELOPMENT ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT AND I THINK EXCITING AREAS OF EARLY ATTACHMENT AS IT RELATES TO ADULT ATTACHMENT COMES TO US FROM THE WORK OF ALLAN SHORE ALLEN SHORE SPELLED A L L A N SHORE  C H O R E IS A PSYCHOANALISTS WHO ALSO HAS DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF NEUROBIOLOGY OF ATTACHMENT BOTH IN CHILDHOOD AND IN ADULTHOOD AND HE'S FOCUSD A LOT ON DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN RIGHT BRAIN AND LEFT BRAIN FORMS OF ATTACHMENT NOW IN A EARLY EPISODE TO THE HUBORMIN LABPODCAST I TOUCHED INTO THE FACT THAT MOST OF WHATS DISSCUSSED IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC ANDS OR POPPSYCHOLOGY AND EVEN IN SOME NEURBIOLOGY COURSES ABOUT RIGHT BRAIN VERSES LEFT BRAIN AND ONE SIDE OF THE BRIN BEING MORE EMOTIONAL ON THE OTHER SIDE BE MORE RATIONAL IS COMPLETELY WRONG O MOST OF WHAT I SEE OUT THERE IS ACTUALLY BACKWORDS TO THE WAYTHINGS ACTUALLY WORK AND WHILE THERE IS SOMEWHAT WE CALL LATERALIZATION OF FUNCTION MEANING CERTAIN BRAIN FUNCTIONS ARE HANDLED BY NURANS ON ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN OR THE OTHER THE IDEA THAT ONE SIDE YOUR BRAIN AS A MOTIONAL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN IS RATIONAL IS JUST NOT SIMPLY NOT TRUE HOWEVER T E WORK OF ALON SHORE POINTS TO SOME VERY CONCRETE NERL CIRCUITS THAT DO HAVE A LATERALIZATION BY US MEANING THEY ARE MORE RIGHT BRAIN THAN LEFT BRAIN OR MORE LEFT BRAIN THAN RIGHT BRAIN THAT UNDERLIE CERTAIN FORMS OF ATTACHMENT BETWEEN CHILD AND PARENT IN PARTICULAR CHILD AND MOTHER AND THAT THESE RIGHT BRAIN ISMS IF YOU WILL AND LEFT BRAIN ISMS FOR ATTACHMENT GET PLAYED OUT AGAIN AND AGAIN IN OUR FORMS OF ATTACHMENT AS ADULTS SO I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT WORK BRIEFLY NOW BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY POINTS TO THE NUMBER OF IMPORTANT FEATURES OF HOW WE ESTABLISH BONDS AND THE DIFFERENT ROUTS TO ESTABLISHING MONSE SO WITHIN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOANALYSIS THERE A LONGSTANDING DISCUSSION OF COURSE ABOUT THE SO CALLED UNCONSCIOUS OR SUBCONSCIOUS THE THINGS THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE OF AND I THINK THERE'S GROWING EVIDENCE POINTING TO THE FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS OR THE UNCONSCIOUS IS THE SO CALLED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THE PORTION OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT CONTROLS ARE REFLECTIVE BREATHING ARE HEART RATE ARE ON SKIN CONDUCTANS MEAN IN OUR SWEATING PUPIL SIZE ITS THE ASPECT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT MAKES US MORE ALERT OR MORE CALM ITS THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC MEANING FOR ALERTNESS OR PARA SYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM PARA SYMPATHETIC FOR MORE CALMING RESPONSES NOW WHAT DOCTOR SHORE'S WORK AND THE WORK OF OTHERS IS NOW SHOWING IS THAT EARLY INFANT PARENT IN PATICULAR INFANT MOTHER ATTACHMENT INVOLVES A COORDINATION OR SYNCRANIZATION OF THESE RIGHT BRAIN CIRCUITS AND THESE LEFT BRAIN CIRCUITS AS THEY RELY RELATE XCUSE ME TO THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT WHILE IT PLAYS OUT WHERE EARLY ON AS AN INFANT WHEN YOU'RE BORN EUROPE TRULY HELPLESS YOU CAN'T FEED YOURSELF YOU CAN'T WARM YOURSELF YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOURSELF AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T EMBULATE WALK ANYWHERE TO GET THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED ALL OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ALL OF THOSE NEEDSERATHER ARE MET BY YOUR PRIMARY CARETAKER TYPICALLY THAT'S THE MOTHER FATHERS OF COURSE PLAY ROLE ALSO BUT BECAUSE A BREAST FEEDING OR EVEN BOTLE FEEDING TYPICALLY MOTHERS PLAY A MORE PROMINENT ROLE I REALIZE THEIR EXCEPTIONS BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL RULE THERE ARE NOW BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES EXAMINING THE BRAINS OF INFANTS END  THE BRAINS OF MOTHERS AS THEY INTERACT AND SHOWING THAT THE PHYSICAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE TWO THE BREATHING OF THE MOTHER AND CHILD THE HEART RATE OF THE MOTHER AND CHILD AND INDEED THE PUPIL SIZE OF THE MOTHER AND CHILD ARE ACTUALLY ACTIVELY GETTING CORDINATED IN OTHER WORDS THE MOTHER IS REGULATING THE INFANTS AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM PRIMARILY AND THE INFANT IS ALSO REGULATING THE MOTHER'S AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM A SMALL COO FROM A BABY OR A CRY WHICH IS A STRESS CRY FROM A BABE WILL DEFINITELY REGULATE THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE MOTHER THIS WHOLE RIGHT BRAIN SYSTEM IS DIRECTLY TAPPED IN TO E SO CALLED OXYTOSEN SYSTEM AND WILL TALK MORE ABOUT OXYTOSEN IN A MOMENT OXYTOSEN AGAIN BEING THIS PEPTIE HORMONE IS INVOLVED IN SOCIAL BONDS OF ALL KINDS BUT THAT AT LEAST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD IS VERY CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH MILK LET DOWN IN MILK PRODUCTION THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF STIMULATION OF OXYTOSAND RELEASE IN THE MOTHER BY NURSING ITSELF SO PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH THE NIPPLE AM AND BY THE CONTACT OF SKIN BETWEEN BABY AND MOTHER AND THEIR SPECIFICITY THERE IT'S NOT JUST ANY BABY THAT CAN EVOKE THE MOST AMOUNT OF OXYTOSE AND RELEASE FROM THE MOTHER NOW HOWEVER THERE ARE EXAMPLES WHERE JUST HOLDING A CHILD WILL EVOKE OXYTOSE AND RELEASE IN THE NON PARENT OR  SOMEBODY OTHER THAN THE PARENT I THINK MOST PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THAT THAT'S THE NEW POPPY OR NEW BABY PHENOMENON CAUSE INDEED POPPIES CAN EVOKE OXYTOSE AND RELEASE AS WELL THE POINT IS NOT THAT OXYTOSIN IS ONLY RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO THE PRIMARY A RELATIONSHIP OR THE MOTHER AND THEIR CHILD BUT RATHER THAT THE AMOUNT OF OXY TOSIN SCALES WITH HOWT CLOSELY RELATED ONE IS TO THAT PARTICULAR CHILD AND AND VICE VERSA SO THERE'S OXYTOSIN RELESE OCCURRING IN BOTH THE CHILD AND THE MOTHER SO THIS RIGHT BRAIN SYSTEM IS AN EMOTIONAL BUT AUTONOMIC SYSTEM IT IS BELOW ARE SUBBELOW OUR CONSCIOUS DETECTION NOW AS WE GET OLDER THERE'S ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT STARTS TO COME INTO PLAY IN PARENT CHILD INTERACTIONS AND THIS ALSO COMES INTO PLAY AND SIBBLING INTERACTIONS AND SO FORTH AND THAT'S THE LEFT BRAIN SYSTEM AS DESCRIBED BY ALONSHORT NOW AGAIN THIS ISN'T ABOUT A MOTION VERSAS RATIONALITY THIS IS ABOUT AUTONOMIC VERSES MORE CONSCIOUS FORMS OF BONDING SO ON THE LEFT BRAIN CRCUIT SIDE WE THERE R IS EVIDENCE FOR BASTE ON NERO IMAGING STUDIES BUT ALSO ANIMAL STUDIES TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT ON THE LEFT BRAIN SIDE OF THINGS THERE IS A PROCESSING MORE OF NARRATIVES THAT ARE VERY CONCRETE LOGICAL NARRATIVES OK AND AGAIN I HAVE TO ZUME OUT AND AND JUST REALLY TAMP DOWN THE IDEA THAT IT'S NOT THAT ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN OF IS EMOTIONAL ON THE OTHER SIDE IS RATIONAL BUT RATHER THAT THESE TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN PARALLEL AND THAT THERE'S A BIT OF A DOMINANCE FOR THE LEFT BRAIN CIRCUITRY TO BE INVOLVED IN THE KINDS OF BONDING THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTION AND REWARD SO GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE READING TO A CHILD EVERY NIGHT SITTING THERE AND READING YOU KNOW I CAN RECALL READING TO MYNICE AND SEEING OF A HER PARENTS READ TO HER AND SHE HAD NO CLUE WHATSOEVER WITH WHA THEY WERE SAYING BECAUSE SHE WELL AT LEAST I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE CERTAINLY COULDN'T SPEAK BUT SHE LIKE LOOKING AT THE PICTURES AND IT WAS A VERY PREDICTIBLE SORT OF INTERACTION IT WAS OKA OUTCOME THE BOOKS IT WAS USUALLY HEARS THE BATH THAN THERE'S THE PAGRAMAS THAN THERE'S THE LIGHTS GO DOWN THAN OUTCOMES THE BOOK AND THEN THERE'S THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD WHICH OF COURSE USUALLY ALSO INVOLVES PHYSICAL CONTACT SO IT'S NOT LAT THE RIGHT BRAIN SYSTEM IN H LEFT BRAIN SYSTEM OR OPERATING SEPARATELY THEIR OPERATING IN PARALLEL BUT THAT SORT OF PREDICTION AND REWARD KITS LIKE TO BE READ TO IS GENERALLY MEEDA BY THIS LEFT BRAIN SYSTEM AND THIS CARRIES ON AS CHILDREN GET OLDER AND IS PARENTS TAKE ON AND EVOLVE THEIR PARENTING ROLLS IT'S  VERY APPARENT THAT HEALTHY SOCIAL BONDING BETWEEN CHILDREN AND CARTAKER RELIES ON THE FACT THAT BOTH THIS RIGHT BRAIN SYSTEM AND THE LEFT BRAIN SYSTEM ARE ENGAGED THAT THERE IS A SYNCHRANIZATION OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION MEANING A JOINING TOGETHER IN ACTUAL SOMATIC FEELING AND THAT THERE IS A SYNCHRANIZATION OF EXPERIENCE THAT'S MORE ABOUT SOME OUTWARD OR EXTERNAL STIMULUS LIKE READING A BOOK OR WATCHING A SHOW TOGETHER OR INJOYING SOME COMMON EXPERIENCE OF A MEAL TOGETHER ND OF COURSE THAS CHILDREN GET OLDER THEY ARE ABLE TO ACTS US MORE AND MORE COGNIIVELY SOPHISTICATED THINGS YOU CAN WATCH A MOVI WITH THEM AND THEYLL MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHICH CHARACTERS ARE GOING TO SHW UP FOR INSTANCE OR YOU CAN A TAKE THEM TO A CONCERT AND THEY CAN APPRECIATE THE CONCERT OR PLAY IN THAT CONCERT AND THEY APPRECIATE THAT THEIR BEING APPRECIATED OCE SO THEIR MILLION DIFFERENT THERE'S INFINITE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES HERE BUT THE IDEAS THAT THEIRE TOO PARALLEL CIRCUITS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR ESTABLISHING BONDS AND THAT THIS IS SET UP VERY EARLY ON IN CHILDHOOD AND THT IT'S NEITHER EMOTIONAL NOR RATIONAL BUT BOTH NOW BOTH OF THESE CIRCUITS TAP IN TO THE CIRCUITRY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHERE DOPOMINE IS RELEASED AND MOLECULES LIKE SERATONAN WHICH AGAIN IS A NAROMODULATOR MORE ASSOCIATED WITH FEELINGS OF WARMTH COMFORT AND SATISFACTION WITH OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS AND POSSESSIONS RATHER THAN SEEKING OF THINGS AND MOTIVATION AND DRAVETICAL LOOK FOR THINGS AS IS THE CASE WITH DOPEMIN SO THERE STILL INTERACTIONS WITH THOSE SYSTEMS BUT THE WORK OF ALANSHORE HAS STIMULATED A LOT OF INTEREST IN WHAT ARE THESE CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE THESE AUTONOMIC BONDING THIS MATCHING OF HEART RATE AND BREATHING AND WHAT ARE THE A NORAL CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE THIS BONDING OR THIS SYNCHRANIZATION OF EXPERIENCE ON THE KIND OF LEFT BRAIN SIDE THE REASON I FIND THIS MODEL SO ATTRACTIVE IS THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HEALTHY CHILD PARENT BONDS ARE ESTABLISHED BUT NOT BY ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE RIGHT BRAIN OR LEFTBRAIN SYSTEMS BUT BY BOTH AND THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO GO INTO IT RIGHT NOW BUT SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THIS IDEA OF ANXIOUS ATTACHED VERSES AVOIDANT ATTACHED VERSES A THERE IS A KIND OF DISSOCIATIVE ATTACHED MODEL OF INFANT PARENT BONDING JUST BRIEFLY WHAT'S BECOMING CLEAR FROM THE NORBIOLOGICAL IMAGING STUDIES IS THAT AS PEOPLE START TO IT ADVANCE INTO ATOLESCENCE AND ADULTHOOD AND WELL INTO THEIR ELDERLY YEARS THE SAME CIRCUITS THAT WERE ACTIVE AND ESTABLISHED IN CHILDHOOD ARE REPURPOSED FOR OTHER FORMS OF ATTACHMENT AND THAT TO HAVE TRULY COMPLETE BONDS WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS BUT IN PARTICULAR WITH ROMANTIC PARTNERS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE BOTH SYNCHRANIZATION OF PHYSIOLOGY AND SYNCHRINIZATION OF THESE MORE I GUESS WE COULD CALL THEM MORE RATIONAL OR PREDICTIVE TYPE CIRCUITS SO WE CAN LEVERISE THIS INFORMATION WE CAN START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF BONDS TO US FEEL VERY ENRICHING AND VERY COMPLETE WE KNOW THAT WE CAN HAVE FOR INSTANCE AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH SOMEBODY BUT WE CAN ALSO HAVE A COGNIVE CONNECTION WITH SOMEBODY I'VE MANY COLLEAGUES WITH WHOM I HAVE DEEP INTELLECTUAL CONNECTION AND CONVERGENCE WITH I WOULN'T SAY THAT I HAVE DEEP EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH MOST OF THEM A FEW OF THEM YES BUT MOST OF THEM KNOW OTHERS IN MY LIFE FOR INSTANCE I HAVE A DEEP EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO BUT NOT A LOT OF DEEP COGNIVE CONNECTION TO A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE CONNECTION THAT I HAD WITH MI BULL DOG WHO UNFORSUING PASSED AWAY BUT COSTELLO WE HAD A VERY CLOSE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION I IT WAS BASED ON TACHA IS BASED ON OUR WALKS IT WAS BASED ON FUN IT WAS VERY AUTONOMIC WHE WE RARELY DISCUSSED IF EVER WHAT WE WERE DOING WE HAD A FELT RELATIONSHIP AS OPPOSED TO A COGNITIVE RELATIONSHIP AND WHILE IAM SORT OF HALF KITTING ABOUT THAT IS AN EXAMPLE IT'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE IT WAS A VERY REAL BOND AND IN FACT JUST AS A BRIEF ANECDOTE I CAN REMEMBER WHEN COSTELLA WAS A PUPPY AND I WAS ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS WELL BEING I LIKE ANY PARENT OF ANY INFANT I LOST MY APPETITE FOR THOSE FEW WEEKS WHEN I WAS HOUSE TRAINING HIM AND I SEEM TO LOSE ALL ABILITY TO PROCESS ANY COGNITIVE INFORMATION NOW WAS ALSO SLEEP DEPRIVED BUT I WAS ENTIRELY FOCUSED OND THE AUTONOMIC BOND THAT WE WERE FORMING NOW THANKFULLY A THAT EVENTUALLY WAS ESTABLISHED PRETTY QUICKLY A BASICALLY I WENT ON TO JUST BASILY FEED HIM WALK HIM AND DO EVERYTHING FOR HIM AND WE HAD A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP NOW IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A FORM OF EMPATHY EMPATHY IS THE ABILITY TO FEEL OR AT LEAST THINK WE FEEL WHAT OTHERS FEEL BECAUSE AGAIN AS MY COLLEAGUE IN THE GREAT BYENGINEER AND PSYCHAATRIS STAMFORD CARLDISEROF HAS SAID ON HE WAS A GUESSED ON THIS PODCAST WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL WE JUST GET THE SENSE THAT PERHAPS WE ARE FEELING THE SAME THING OR RE FEELING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WE INFER R WE PROJECT WHAT THEY MIGHT BE THINKING EMPATHY IS THIS SENSE THAT WE ARE SENSING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SENSING OKIAND THERE'S NO REAL WAY TO VERIFY THAT EXCEPT IF YOUR MEASURING PHYSIOLOGIES YOU COULD GET SOME INSIDE INTO THAT IN THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND IN THE NERBIOLOGICAL LITERATURE NOW IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE IS BOTH EMOTIONAL EMPATHY LIKE ACTUALLY FEELING WHAT SOMEBODY IS FEELING AND WHAT IS NOW CALLED COGNITIVE EMPATHY COGNIVE EMPATHY IS THIS IDEA THAT WE BOTH SEE AND EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THE SAME WAY AT A MENTAL LEVEL EMOTIONAL EMPATHY IS THIS IDEA THAT YES I CAN FEEL WHAT YOU FEEL AT A VICERAL SOMMATIC OR AUTONOMIC LEVEL AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT STRONG SOCIAL BONDS BETWEEN CHILDREN AND CARETAKER I VOLVE BOTH EMOTIONAL EMPATHY THIS AUTONOMIC FUNCTION AND COGNIVE EMPATHY THAT THERE'S HA MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE OTHER PERSON FEELS AND HOW THE OTHER PERSON THINKS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEYARE GOING TO DO IT'S ALSO VERY CLEAR BASED ON THE EMERGING LITERATURE THAT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND TO SOME EXTENT FRIENDSHIPS ALTHOUGH IT FRIENDSHIPS HAVE BEEN EXPLORED A BIT LESS IN THE LITERATURE THAT EMOTIONAL MPATHY AND COGNIVE EMPATHY ARE BOTH REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHAT WE CALL A TRUSTING SOCIAL BOND ANDTHERE'S OM BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS DONE USING NOUR IMAGING OF TWO INDIVIDUALS PLAYING A TRUST GAME ESSENTUALLY A GAME WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO PREDICT THE OTHER PERSONS BEHAVIOR WHETHER NOT THEY WILL BEHAVE IN A TRUSTWORTHY WAY AND THESE A EXPERIMENTS TEND TO USE REAL MONEY AS O THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING AT STAKE AND YOU CAN MOREOR LESS PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY FEELS A LOT OF TRUST FOR SOMEBODY ELSE AND WHETHER NOT THEY BELIEVE THEY WILL ACT IN A TRUSTWORTHY MANNER BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF BOTH OGNITIVE EMPATHY AND EMOTIONAL EMPATHY SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE SEEKING TO ESTABLISH DEEPER BONDS OR BONDS OF ANY KIND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU THINK ABOUT SYNCRANIZATION OF BODILY STATES WE TALKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER AND SYNCARNIZATION OF COGNIVE STATES NOW THAT DOESN'T MEN YOU HAVE TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING IN FACT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO FEEL VERY CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER COGNIVELY AND EMOTIONALLY ARGUE ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND DISAGREE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS IN FACT WE PROBABLY KNOW A I CERTAINLY KNOW PEOPLE AND COUPLES O THAT SEEM TO BOND THROUGH ARGUING WHICH A IS AN INTERESTING PHENATYPE IN ITSELF BUT THE POINT ISN'T THAT THERE BE TOTAL CONVERGENCE OF OPINION OR STANDS BUT RATHER THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE OTHER FEELS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND HOW WE FEEL THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE OTHER PERSON THINKS AND THAT THEY THINK THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY THINK SO IT'S A RECIPROCAL LUTE BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE THAT INVOLVES THIS COGNITION AND INVOLVES EMOTION AND IT'S GROUNDED AS DOCTOR SHARE HAS POINTED OUT IN OUR EARLIEST FORMS OF ATTACHMENT AND THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE BECAUSE THE SAME SORTS OF CIRCUITS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOCIALHOMIA STASIS THE KIND OF RIGHT BRAIN AND LEFT BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR INFANT MOTHER ATTACHMENT AND THEN LATER FOR IN MORE INTELLECTUAL OR PREDICTIVE TYPE ATTACHMENTS BETWEEN CHILD AND CAREGIVER ARE THE EXACT SAME CIRCUITS THAT WE SUPERIMPOSED IN ALL OTHER TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF OUR LIFE AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION THAT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MIGHT BE THINKING THAT YOU HAD A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY INFANT CARETAKER INTERACTION OR FORM OF ATTACHMENT YOU ARE NOT ALONE AND IN FACT MUCH OF THE WORK THAT DOCTOR SHORE FOCUS IS ON IS ABOUT HOW THOSE EARLY CIRCUMSTANCES CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AND REWIRED TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY ADULT ATTACHMENT AND IF YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT HIS WORK A E'S ACTUALLY GOT A FEW UTUVIDIOS OUT THERE O AGAIN IT'S ALLENSHORE SPELLED C H O R E AD LOVE TO GET HIM AS A GUEST ON THE PODCAST HELS WHO HAS A BOOK ITS CALLED RIGHT BRAIN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND IT'S AN EC CELLENT BOOK IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY ACCESSIBLE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY OR PSYCHOLOGY I FOUND IT TO BE VERY INTERESTING THERE A LOT O EXCELLENT REFERENCES AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE LISTENING DOCTOR SHAWER YOU KNOW ALANSHORE WE LOVE TO GET YOU ON THE POCAST ONE OF THE KEY THEMES TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IS THAT THEY OFTEN WORK ON SHORT TIME SCALES AND LONGER TIME SCALES AND UP UNTIL NOW WE'VE MAINLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE STUFF THAT HAPPENS ON SHORT TIME SCALES SO THE KIND OF SYNCRANIZATION OF HEART RATE OR ACTIVATION OF A GIVEN SET OF NURONS THET DUMP SOME DOPOMENE AND CAUSES US TO SEEK OUT A MORE SOCIAL INTERACTION OR LESS FOR INSTANCE BUT EVERY BIOLOGICAL CIRCUIT AND FUNCTION NEEDS TO HAVE LONG STANDING EFFECTS AS WELL AND TIPICALLY WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT LONGSTANDING EFFECTS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY YOU START LOOKING TOWARDS THE HORMON SYSTEM IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT NEUR TRANSMITTERS AND UROMODULATORS ARE PRETTY QUICK WHEREAS HORMONES HAVE LONGER LASXTING EFFACTS IN FACT A LOT OF HORMONES CAN ACTUALLY TRAVEL TO THE NUCLEUS OF A CELLE AND ACTUALLY CHANGE WHICH GENES ARE EXPRESSED SO IF EVER THERE WAS A HORMONE OR HORMON LIKE MOLECULE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIAL BONDING IT'S OXY TOSEN AND OXYTOSIN HAS A TON OF INTEREST IN THE POPULAR PRESS I W KNOW WHY THAT IS BUT PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE OF ALL THE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT OXYTOSEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH AND IT IS INDEED A LOT OF THINGS SO FOR INSTANCE OXYTOSIN IS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND BINDS TO RECEPTORS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE BODY AND THE MOMENT YOU HEAR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE BODY RECEPTERS YOU SHOULD THINK WELL ITS CAN HAVE LOXO DIFFERENT EFFECTS AND INDEED IT DOES OXYTOSIN IS INVOLVED IN ORGASM IT'S INVOLVED IN SOCIAL RECOGNITION THAT'S RIGHT WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE THAT YOU CONSIDER YOUR PEOPLE YOUR TEAM YOUR GROUP YOUR FRIENDS OYTOSIN IS RELEASED EVEN IF YOU DON'T COME INTO PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH THEM OXYTOSIN IS ALSO SOCIATE WITH PAIR BONDING THE FEELING THAT THEY ARE YOUR PERSON AND THAT YOU ARE THEIRE PERSON AS THE COMMON LANGUAGE PEOPLE USE IT'S ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH HONESTY BELIEVE ARE NOT THEIRE EXPERIMENTS THAT SHOW THAT IF PEOPLE RECEIVE A OXYTOSIN THROUGH AN INNOLATION SPRAY THAT THEY WILL BE MORE HONEST AND FORTHCOMING ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS AND THE OXYTOSEN SYSTEM AND VARIANCE IN THE OXYTOS AND SYSTEM HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH OTISM IN VARIOUS OXTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS SO THERE'S A HUGE RANGE OF BEHAVIORS THAT'S INVOLVEDIN BECAUSE YIF RECEPTRS FOROXYTOSIN LOTS OF DIFFERENT BRAIN STRUCTURES AND ERE IS THE BODY THAT DO DIFFERENT THINGS HOWEVER THERE SOME VERY CONSISTENT EFFECTS OF OXYTOSEN THAT ARE WORTH JUST LISTING OFF AND THEN I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO SEPARATE PATHWAYS BY WHICH OXYTOSIN CAN MANIFEST ITS EFFECTS AND HOW YOU CAN ACTUALY REGULATE OXYTOSEN AND WAYS THAT ARE INTERESTING AND PERHAPS USEFUL AS WELL FIRST OF ALL OXYTOSIN IS INVOLVED IN THE MILK LET DOWN REFLEX LACTATION THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE THERE NEEDS TO BE A CUE BY WHICH THE SUCKLING ON THE NIPPLE OF THE INFANT CAUSES THE RELEASE OR LET DOWN OF MILK AND MILKE LET DOWN IN LACTATION IS CONTROL BY PROLACTIN ANOTHER HORMA BUT ALSO OXYTOSIN OXYTOSE IS ALSO INVOLVED IN UTERAN CONTRACTION JURING CHILD BIRTH ITS INVOLVED IN SERVICAL DILATION TO ALLOW THE BABY TO PASS OUT OF THE BIRTH CANALE SO ITS INVOLVED IN INDUCTION OF BRESFEEDING AND OF LABOR WHICH IS REMARKABLE AN ESPECUALLY REMARKABLE GIVEN THAT IN MALES RELEASE IN SOME MALE ANIMALS AND IN SOME MALE HUMANS AND I DO ONE SAY SOME AND ILL GET BACK TO THIS IT CAN BE INVOLVED IN THE ERECTION RESPONSE IT CAN BE INVOLVED IN THE ORGANASM RESPONDS IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES ALTHOUGH THERE THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING DIFFERENCE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT THIS BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT IN FEMALES SEXUAL STIMULATION AND ORGANASM CAUSE THE RELEASE OF OYTOSIN WHEREAS IN MALES SEXUAL STIMULATION DOES NOT CAUSE THE RELEASE OF OXYTOSIN BUT RATHER A DIFFERENT VOLCULE VASE OPPRESSIN IS TRIGGERED BY SEXUAL STIMULATION BUT ORGANASM DOES TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF OXYTOSIN AN MALES BUT WITH TE DELAY OF ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES WHY THAT IS IN THE SPECIFIC FUNCTION OF THAT IS NOT CLEAR BUT IT DOES SEEM THE OXYTOSIN IS INVOLVED IN THE PSEXUAL RESPONSE IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES THE MAIN TYPES OF INTERACTIONS THAT RELEASE OXYTOSIN AT HIGH LEVELS ARE FIRST OF ALL THAT THE INTERACTION BE BEBETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT SEE EACH OTHER AS VERY CLOSELY ASSOCIATED RIGHT SO A INFANT AND MOTHER ARE VERY CLOSLY ASSOSIATED WHETHER NOTS IN ADOPTED INFANT OR NOT OFTENTIMES THEIRE IN CLOSE CONTACT OFTENTIMES THEY ARE FROM THE VERY BODY OF THE OTHER AND SO THE AMOUNT OR THE AMPLITUDE OF OXYTOSIN RELEASE TENDS TO SCALE WITHOUT CLOSELY ASOSCIATED INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST THE SIHTE OF ONE'S BABY OR SMELL OF ONE'S BABY CAN EVOKE OXYTOSIN RELEASE AND VICE VERSA FROM THE MOTHER PHYSICAL CONTACT EVEN MORE SO IN ROMANTIC PARTNERS PHYSICAL CONTACT EVEN THE SIGHT OF A PICTURE OF A PARTNER CAN EVOKE OXYTOSIN RELEASE AND SEXUAL DESIRE ALSO TRUST SO THERE IS IS WHOLE COLLECTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL THINGS THAT ARE PACKAGE INTO THE OXYTOSIN SYSTEM IT'S NOT JUST A ONE WAY SYSTEM NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE WRITTEN TO ME ASKING ABOUT A INHALENT OXYTOSIN ASKING WHETHER NOT THAT CAN AUALLY INCREASE THE DEPTH OR RATE OF PERBONDING AND THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME EVIDENCE FOR THAT NOW I THINK IN MOST PLACES OXYTOSIN IS PRESCRIPTION ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE OVER THE COUNTER AN OTHERS I DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE TO CHECK WHERE YOU ARE S FAR AS I KNOW YOU CANT JOUST GO OUT AND BY OXYTOSIN NASAL SPRAY ALTHOUGH YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FORGIVE ME A NAIVE TO THAT POINT BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT SOME DRUGS THAT ARE BEING USED IN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THINGS LIKE TRAMA AND ARE ALSO USED IN CLINICAL THERAPUTIC SETTINGS FOR INCREASING BONDING IN PARTICULAR EMDI AMA ALSO CALLED ECSTASY INCREASE DOPAMINE AND CERETONE AND WE KNOW THIS DOPOMING IN CERATONAN HAVE VAST NUMBER OF FECT THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THEM TO DAY IN ANOTHER POTCAS BUT ONE OF THE LESSER APRECIATED EFFECTS OF OF M DI AMA IS THAT IT CAUSES HUGE INCREASES MASSIVE INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF OXYTOSIN THATS RELEASED INTO THE BRAIN AND BODY AND MDIAMA ASSISTED PSYCHOTHERAPY WHILE STILL ILLEGAL AS FAR AS I KNOW CERTAINLY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT IN MOST PLACES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IS BEING EXPLORED IN CLINICAL TRIALS NOT JUST FOR TRAMA NOT JUST FOR DEPRESSION NOT JUST FOR EATING DISORDERS BUT ALSO FOR REESTABLISHING WHAT SEEM TO BE FRACTURED OR CHALLENGED BONDS BETWEEN ROMANTIC PARTNERS AND WHILE MOST OF THE ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE DOPOMAN URGIC AND SERATONERGIC ASPECT OF THE EMDIAMA RESPONSE IT'S CLEAR TO ME BASED ON MYRED OF THE LIRATURE THAT THE ENORMOUSLY ELEVATED OXYTOSIN THAT OCCURS DURING THE CONSUMPTION OF M DI AMA IS PART OF THE REASON WHY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE DURING THE EMDIAMA SESSION AND POST EM DIAMA SESSION A MUCH GREATER DEGREE AND DEPTH OF KINSHIP OR FEELING OF CONNECTION WITH THAT PERSEN AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THAT FEELING OF CONNECTION IS OF THE AUTONOMIC TYPE THAT I WAS REFERRING TO EARLIER ALLA ALLONSHORIS WORK THAT IT'S NOT OF THE O WE THINK ABOUT THINGS THE EXACT SAME WAY WE AGREE ON EVERYTHING NOW IT'S MORE OF THAT THEIR PHYSIOLOGIES ARE SYNCHRONIZED SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN IN INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A COUPLE WHERE ONE DOES A THERAPUTIC SESSION AND THE OTHER DOES NOT THEY STILL BOTH THEAL QUITE MORE BONDED TO THE OTHER NOW OFTENTIMES IN THE CLINICAL THERAPUTIC SETTING BOTH MEMBERS OF A COUPLE OR ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIP WHATEVER THAT FORM IT MAY TAKE ARE CONSUMING M DIAMA AND THEN THEREBY EXPERIENCING ELEVATED OXYTOSIN AND THIS ENHANT SENSE OF BONDING AND AGAIN ATS THIS AUTONOMIC BONDING BUT IT'S SO POWERFUL MEANING THE OXYTOSEN RESPONSE IS SO POWERFUL THAT IT DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE THAT BOTH INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCED THIS HUS IN FLEXION AND OXYTOSIN AND THATS BECAUSE ONE PERSON'S PHYSIOLOGIES INFLUENCING THE OTHER AND OXYTOSIN IS THIS KIND OF BRIDGING SIGNAL THAT OCCURS IN BOTH NERVOUS SYSTEMS SYNCHRONIZES THINGS LIKE HEART BEAT OBVIOUSLY ITS ASSOCIATED WITH TOUCHAN S OF PEOPLE ARE TOUCHING OR PEOPLE RE ENGAGING THE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS THAT I MENTION EARLIER THAT CAN INCREASE OXYTOSAN FURTHER THATS CAN A FURTHER INCREASE THE DEPTH OF THE BOND BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT THEREIS ACTUALLY A HORMONAL GLUE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS O C INFANT AND MOTHER FRIENDS TEEN MATES ROMANTIC PARTNERS AND SO ON AND THAT HORMONAL GLUE IS OXYTOSIN NOW PEOPLE VARY IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY FEEL OR HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FEEL BONDED TO ANYONE AND IT IS NOW GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT SOME OF THAT VARIATION MIGHT DEPEND ON VARIATIONS IN OXYTOSE AND RECEPTORS OR WHAT ARE CALLED GENE POLYMORPHISMS FOR OXYTOSEN GENES CAN HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SEQUENCES IN THEM THEIR NEWCLYTIED SEQUENCES WE WERE GOING TO GENETICS RIGHT NOW AGES AND GEAS AND SAS AND TEAS IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS ARE WHAT MAKE UP THE GENES GENES ARE TRANSCRIBED INTO ARE IN A ARE IN A IS TRANSLATED INTO PROTINES THAT AFFECT CELLS OK THE OXYTOSE IN GENE AND COD FOROXYTOSEN AND VARIANCE IN THAT GENE CHANGE THE AMOUNT AND FUNCTION OF OXYTOSEN THERE'S A REALLY INTERESTING STUDY PUBLISHJUST THIS LAST YEAR IN A RELATIVELY NEW JOURNAL THAT JOURNAL HAS A KIND OF A UNUSUAL NAME THATS HELION I THINK ITS HELION AND NOT HELYON BUT HELION H H L IWIOAND THIS IS SEL PRESS JOURNAL SFAR AS I CAN TELL ITS A VERY SOLID JOURNAL CERTAINLY THE SEL PRESS LABLE ON IS VERY STRINGENT AND THIS PAPER IS ENTITLED THE RELATION BETWEEN OYTOSAND RECEPTOR GENE POLYMORPHISMS WHICH JUST MEANS CHANGES IN IN GENES ERE VARIATIONS AND GENES ADULT ATTACHMENT AND INSTEGRAM SOCIABILITY AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS THIS ARE REALLY WILD STUDY BUT I LIKE THE STUDY TS VERY THOROUGH FIRST AUTHOR LAST NAME COROLO C A R O L L O AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT BY ANALYZING THE GENETICS OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND LOOKING T HOW MANY PEOPLE THOSE INDIVIDUALS FOLLOW AND HOW MANY PEOPLE FOLLOW THEM AND WHAT THEY COME UP WITH US A SO CALLED SOCIAL DESIRABILITY INDECTS THEY WERE ABLE TO CORELATE IN A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY THAT PEOPLE THAT CARRY CERTAIN VARIANCE IN THE OXYTOSAN AND OXYTOSAND RECEPTOR GENES ACTUALLY SEEK OUT MORE ONLINE SOCIAL INSTEGRAM INTERACTIONS SO SOME PEOPLE I KNOW I WON'T NAME THEIR NAMES ONLY FOLLOW YOU KNOW ANYWHERE FROM ZERO TO SIX ACCOUNTS OTHER PEOPLE FOLLOW THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS AND THEY TAKE THE RATIO OF HOW MANY ACCOUNTS PEOPLE FOLLOW VERS AS HOW MANY FOLLOWERS THEY HAVE ARGUABLY NOT A PERFECT MEASURE BUT A NICE ONE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU CAN DO THIS IN A COMPLETELY UNBIASED WAY WITH MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE TO GET GENOMAC ANALYSIS FROM A NUMBER OF THESE SUBJECTS AND IT TURNS OUT THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LET SAY HIRE LEVELS OF OXYTOSEAND FUNCTION OR POTENTIAL LEVELS OF OXYTOSAN FUNCTION ACTIVELY SEEK OUT MORE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO THIS I THINK REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT FIRST IN THE AREA OF HOW SOCIAL MEDIA AND DATA FROM SOCIAL METEOR STRYING TO EMERGE WITH BIOLOGICAL DATA IN TERMS OF PREDICTING HOW AVIDLY PEOPLE WILL SEEK OUT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OF AN ONLINE TYPE AND NOWDAYS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT HOW ONLINE ON WE ARE CONNECTED BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY WHERE WHAT IS IT WERE COMMUNICATING BUT WERE NOT CONNECTED OR THE CONNECTIONS AREN REAL I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO REVISIT THAT WHILE I AM CERTAINLY A BELIEVER IN THE IDEA THAT FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION AND COMMON INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE STANDING IN THE SAME PA SPACE OR PLAYING SPORTS TOGETHER EN JOYING MUSIC TOGETHER EN JOYING MEALS TOGETHER AS VITALLY IMPORTANT THERE'S AN ENTIRE GENERATION OR SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING UP WHO MUCH OF THEIR SOCIAL INTERACTION HAS BEEN ON LINE AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SPELLED OUT EARLIER ABOUT COMMON MENTAL NARRATIVE THIS LEFT BRAIN SYSTEM ALLA ALLONSHORE OR AUTONOMIC BONDING OR SYNCRANIZATION OF HEART BEATS ACCORDING TO COMMON STORIES ALL THAT IS HAPPENING IN ONLINE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WHEN A THOUSAND OF US LOOK AT THE EXACT SAME INSTEGRAM POST YES WE WILL HAVE A THOUSAND INDEPENDENT RESPONSES TO THAT BUT CHANCES OURE MANY OF US HAVE A SIMILAR OR SAME RESPONSE BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN SYNCRANIZATION OF HEART BEATS AND SO WE ARE SOCIALLY BONDED WITH OTHER PEOPLE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND ITS VERY APPARENT THAT THE OXYTOSE AND SYSTEM IS PLAYING SOME ROLE IN THAT AND THIS IF WE ZUME OUT MAKES PERFECT SENSE BECAUSE AGAIN DOPOMINE SERATONIN PROLACTIN OXYTOSIN NONE OF THESE SYSTEMS WERE PLACED IN US OR ARE ORGANIZED WITHIN US IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE SPECIFIC AND ONLY SPECIFIC TYPES OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THE ONE THAT WE CAN SAY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IS THE CHILD PARENT INTERACTION RIGHT BECAUSE CHILDREN SIMPLY CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THEY NEED A CARETAKOR I SHOULD HAVE SAID CARETAKER NOT PARENT BUT INFANTS IF THEY DON'T IF THEY'RE NOT TAKING CARE WILL DIE BUT BEYOND THAT WE HAVE EVOLVED OR COME TO REALIZE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND ON LINE INTERACTIONS NOWADAYS ARE VERY VERY COMMON I'M CERTAINLY INVOLVED TTHEM ON GUESSING YOURE INVOLVED IN THEM AS WELL WERE INVOLVED IN ONE RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE THE OXYTOSAN SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY THREADED THROUGH AND LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE TYPES OF SOCIAL BONDS AS WELL AND INCIDENTALLY OXYTOSAN IS THE NAME OF THE FIFTH SONG ON BILLIOLOG'S SECOND ALBUM HAPPIER THAN EVER SO WE'VE COVERED A LOT ABOUT THE BIOLOGY AND INDEED THE NERAL CIRCUITRY AND NURL CHEMISTRY AND NERRO INDERCHRONOLOGY OF SOCIAL BONDING ONE MAKE SURE THAT A HILITE THE KEY FEATURES THAT GO INTO ANY IN ALL OF YOUR SOCIAL BONDS FIRST OF ALL ALLSOCIAL BONDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCLUDE BOTH WHAT WE CALLED EMOTIONAL EMPATHY AND COGNIVE EMPATHY AND SO FEW ARE INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING AND DEEPENING SOCIAL BONDS OF ANY KIND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU PUT SOME EFFORT TOWARD THIS THING THAT WE CALL EMOTIONAL EMPATHY WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT SHARING AUTONOMIC EXPERIENCE NOT DEPENDING ON THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WILL TAKE ON DIFFERENT CONTACTS WHAT'S APPROPRIATE IN ONE TYPE OF BOND IS NOT CAN BE APPROPRIATE IN ANOTHER TYPE OF BOND PHYSICAL CONTACT FOR INSTANCE IS APPROPRIATE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF BONDS AND NOT FOR OTHERS NONE THE LESS EMOTIONAL EMPATHY AND THE SYNCHRANIZATION OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION HEARTRATE BREATHING ET CETERA CAN BE BEST ACCOMPLISHED BY PAYING ATTENTION TO EXTERNAL EVENTS IN PARTICULAR NARRATIVE STORY MUSIC AND PERHAPS SPORTS OR OTHER TYPES OF EXPERIENCE AS AN EXTERNAL STIMULUS TO DRIVE SYNCRANY OF THOSE INTERNAL STATES THE OTHER ASPECT OF FORMING DEEP BONDS IS COGNIVE EMPATHY AGAIN COGNIF EMPATHY IS NOT ABOUT AGREEING ON THINGS OR VIEWING THINGS THE EXACT SAME WAY IT'S ABOUT REALLY GAINING UNDER STANDING OF HOW SOMEBODY ELSE THINKS ABOUT SOMETHING REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT END THEN PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW YOU THINK ABOUT AND FEEL ABOUT SOMETHING SO THAT'S WHAT COGNIVE EMPATHY IS SO MOTIONAL AN COGNIVEEMPATHY TOGETHER ARE WHAT MAKE UP THESE REALLY ROBUST BONDS OF VARIOUS KINDS NOW WE ALSO DOCKES ABOUT INTRVERSION AND EXTRAVERSION AND I'D LIKE TO TRYING DISMANTL THE COMMON MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT INTRVERSION EXTRVERSION BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NERAL CIRCUITRY AS YOU RECALL INTRVERTS ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE SOCIAL INTERACTION ITS JUST THAT THEY EEL FILLED UP OR SATED BY LESS SOCIAL INTERACTION THAN WOULD BE AN EXTRAVATE AND THAT'S BECAUSE AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE SOCIAL HOMEASTATI CIRCUIT MODEL THE ACTUALLY GET MORE DOPOMINE FROM LESS SOCIAL INTERACTION O KES LIKE SOMEBODY WHO SATED BY LESS AMOUNT OF FOOD O KA IT DOES N'T MEAN THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME APPETITE IT JUST MEANS THAT THEY GET MORE FROM LESS WHEREAS EXTRAVERTS GET LESS DOPOMINE RELEIASE FROM AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF SOCIAL INTERACTION OF COURSE THESE AREN'T PRECISE MEASUREMENTS BUT ON THE WHOLE EXTRAVERTS NEED MORE SOCIAL INTRACTION MORE FREQUENT MORE LONG LASTING ET CETERA IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT DOPOMINE THRESHOLD BECAUSE AGAIN DOPOMINE IS DRIVING THAT CRAVING OF SOCIAL INTERACTION AND ONCE IT'S MET THAN PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO SEEK SOCIAL INTERACTION IS MUCH SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT FEEL AS IF YOURE N INTROVERT OR EXTRAVERT OR THAT NO INTRVERTS AND EXTRAVERTS IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW VERBAL PEOPLE ARE IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY SEEK OUT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS PER SAY IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH SOCIAL INTERACTION IS ENOUGH FOR THE GIVEN PERSON NOW THE WHOLE REASON FOR PROVIDING THIS FRAMEWORK THIS BIOLOGICAL SIRCUITRY ET CETERA IS NOT TO SIMPLY PUT A REDUCTIONIST VIEW ON THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY REALIZED AND NEW BUT RATHER TO GIVE YOU SOME LEVERAGE POINTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT THAT YOU FORM SOCIAL BONDS HOW IS IT THAT YOU MIGHT BE CHALLENGE IN FORMING SERTAINS TYPES OF SOCIAL BONDS AND TO THINK ABOUT ENTRY POINTS TO BOTH ESTABLISHING AND REINFORCING SOCIAL BONDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS HOPEFULLY IT WILL ALSO GIVE YOU INSIDE INTO WHY BREAK UPS WHETHER IT BE BETWEEN FRIENDSHIPS ARE ROMANTIC PARTNERS CAN BE SO PAINFUL A BREAK UP OF ANY KIND INVOLVES BOTH A BREAKING OF THAT EMOTIONAL EMPATHY AND THAT COGNIOVE EMPATHY AND INDEED IT HAS A NEURBIOLOGICAL AND HORMONAL UNDERPINNING RIGHT WE GO INTO SOME SENSE A SOCIAL ISOLATION EVEN FOR SURROUNDED BY OTHER TYPES OF PEOPLE IF ONE OF OUR MAJOR SOURCES OF OXYTOSEN OR ONE OF OUR MAJOR SOURCES OF DOPOMNE SUDDENLY IS NOT AROUND THAT IS INCREDIBLY DEVASTATING TO A NERVOUS SYSTEM AND TO BORROW FROM THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST AND NERBIOLOGIST LESA FELPMAN BERIT WHO SAYS YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT JUST INDIVIDUALS WE ARE NERVOUS SYSTEMS INFLUENCING OTHER NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEMS ARE INFLUENCING US I THING THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT SO IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT BREAK UPS OF VARIOUS KINDS ARE VERY CHALLENGING REGARDLES OF WHAT A UNDERLIE THAT BREAK UP THERE NOT SOMEBODY MOVING OR AN ACTUAL DECISION OF ONE PERSON TO LEAVE THE RELATIONSHIP OR BOTH ET CETERA ON THE MORE POSITIVE SIDE LARGELY BIOLOGICAL BUT TO SOME EXENT PSYCHOLOGICAL VIEW OF SOCIAL BONDING WILL ALSO ALLOW YOU TO ORIENT IN THIS VAST LANDSCAPE THAT WE CALL SOCIAL BONDS TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS PERHAPS THAT YOU SEEK OUT SO MANY ONLINE INTERACTIONS MAYBE YOU HAVE THE A OXYTOSIN A POLYMORPHISM THAT CAUSES YOU TO WANT MORE A FOLLOW MORE ACCOUNTS OR INTERACT MORE WITH PEOPLE N A COMMENT MORE OR SPONTE COMMENTS WHO KNOWS IAM ALSO HOPING THAT IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO GET A LENDS INTO HOW YOU CAN STRENGTHEN THE SOCIAL BONDS THAT YOU WANT TO STRENGTHEN AND TO ESTABLISH NEW SOCIAL BONDS THAT YOU WANT TO ESTABLISH NONE OF THIS IS MEANT TO MANIPULATE OR LAVERAGE SOCIAL BONDS THAT WOULDOTHERWISE FORM TO THE CONTRARY ITS ABOUT IDENTIFYING WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC ROUTS BY WHICH SOCIAL BONDS ARE CREATED AND ALLOWING YOU I HOPE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU FEEL CHALLENGE IN FORMINGS AR SOCIAL BONDS WITH OR MAY BE DECIDING TO COMPLETELY DIVORCE FROM THOSE SOCIAL BONDS ENTIRELY BECAUE THERES ABSOLUTELY NO HOPE OF EVER FORMING EMOTIONAL OR COGNIVE EMPATHY I CERTAINLY KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT COULD BE THE CASE TO SO THERE'S BOTH A LIGHT AND A DARK AND A GRAYZONE TO THIS ENTIRE THING THAT WE CALL SOCIAL BONDING WHAT IS NOT GRADED BUT IS ABSOLUTE AS THEY SAY IS THAT SOCIAL BONDS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO US AS A SPECIES WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE AT A DISTANCE OVER SOCIAL MEDIA WHETHER ARE NOT THEY ARE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY ACTUAL PHYSICAL CONTACT TO DAY WOATD IVEREALLY TRIED TO ILLUSTRATE IS THAT THERE ARE COMMON SET OF BIOLOGICAL NEURO CHEMICAL AND ORMONAL UNDER PENNINGS TO WHAT WE CALL SOCIAL BONDING AND SO WHILE IT IS COMPLEX AND IT IS SUBJECTIVE IT INVOLVES HIER KEYS IT INVOLVES ARE PREVIOUS UPBRINGING IT OF VOLVES ARE GOALS ET CETERA IT IS NOT INFINITELY COMPLEX AND IN THAT SENSE IT IS TRACTABLE HOPEFULLY IHAVE OFFERED YOU SOME LEAVE LEVERS OR SOMEENTARY POINTS UNDER WHICH YOU CAN BOTH UNDERSTAND AND MOVE TOWARD SOCIAL BONDS THAT WOULD BE MORE SATISFYNG AND MORE GRATIFYING FOR YOU THAT CERTAINLY ONE OF THE GUALS THE OTHER ONE IS THAT HOPEFULLY IF YOU ARE CLINITION OR SIMPLY THE FRIEND THAT PEOPLE GO TO ORE THE FAMILY MEMBER THAT PEOPLE GO TO WHEN THEY ARE CHALLENGED THROUGH A VARIOUS CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL BONDS THAT YOU CAN START TO PERHAPS PASS ALONG SOME OF THE INFORMATION AS A WAY OF PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING WHAT THER GOING THROUGH AS THEY ARE BREAKING UP BUT ALSO AS THEY ARE FALLING IN LOVE AS THEY ARE FORMING ATTACHMENTS AND AS THEY ARE BEING CHALLENGED WITH ATTACHMENTS THAT'S TO MY HOPE AND ESPECIALLY AS YOU HEAD INTO THE HOLIDAYS AND END OF YEAR A BUT ALSO AS IT CONTINUES INTO TWENTY TWENTY TWO I WOULD HOPE THAT YOUWOULD TAKE THIS KNOWLEDGE AND APPLY IT IN ANY THE WAYS THAT YOU FEEL ARE MEANINGFUL AND ADAPTIVE FOR YOU IF YOUR LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEAS SUBSCRIBE T OUR YOU TO CHANNEL THAT

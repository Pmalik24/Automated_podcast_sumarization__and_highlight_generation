WHEN SHE WAS ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD SO RUSSIA WASN'T SOME RACISM FR UTOPIA PEOPLE LIKE YULINA OBVIOUSLY CAME UP AGAINST WHAT I WOULD CALL RACISM BUT WHEN I ASKED ULINA ABOUT IT THAT WAS NOT RACISM THAT WAS CURIOSITY THAT WAS IGNORANCE BUT NOT A RACISM THIS HAPPENED A LOT IN OUR CONVERSATION YULI KNOW WOULD TELL A STORY ABOUT SOME EXPERIENCE THAT SOUNDED HONESTLY HORRIBLE TO ME BUT SHE'D ALWAYS INSIST THAT IT WASN'T RACISM OR DISCRIMINATION IT WAS IGNORANCE I THINK THA IGNORANCE CAN BE AND OFTEN IS RACISM BUT I DIDN'T WANTED TO BATE THAT FACT SO MUCH AS UNDERSTAND HOW SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT OLIV PEOPLE COMMENTED ON IT YULIDI DIDN'T THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE COLOR OF HER SKIN WHEN SHE WAS A CH HILD SHE DIDN'T FEEL DIFFERENT BECAUSE SHE WAS BLACK BUT BECAUSE HER FAMILY CAME FROM AMERICA IT WASN'T UNTIL SHE STARTED THINKING ABOUT BOYS IN LOVE THAT SHE THOUGHT MORE AND MORE ABOUT THE WAY SHE LOOKED HOW MUCH SHE STOOD OUT FROM EVERYONE ELSE AND I WOULD ASK MY MOTHER MAM WHY AM MY SO UGLY WHY IS MY NOSE SO BIG WHY ON MY LIPS SO GUGE AND SHE WULD SAY NO YOUR BEAUTIFUL AND THEN SHE WOULD ASK HER AMERICAN FRIENDS TO BRING AMERICAN MAGAZINES BLACK AND LOVELY I THINK IT WAS COLLD BLACKE AND

DATE TOU BECAUSE THEY LOVE YOU BUT BECAUSE THEY WOULD WANT TO TRY DATING A BLAKE GIRL AND THAT'S WHY MY SELF WAS STE WAS DAMAGE PROBABLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T TRUST ANY RUSSIAN GY THAT WOULD APPROACH ME AND I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH ME AT ALL SINCERELY I WANTED TO KNOW THE WAYS IN WHICH BEING BLACK SHAPED YELINA'S LIFE IN RUSSIA AND TO HEAR HER TELL IT HER FAMILY WAS NEVER DENIED AN APARTMENT BECAUSE OF HER RACE SHE WAS NEVER PUT INTO AN INFERIOR SCHOOL BECAUSE OF HER RACE SHE WAS NEVER SINGLED OUT BY LAW INFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF HER RACE THERE WASN'T THAT KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM BUT SHE WAS LONELY SHE FELT UNDESIRABLE BEING BLACK MADE IT HARD FOR HER TO IMAGINE A FUTURE WITH A PARTNER SO MUCH OF MY CONVERSATION WITH HER WAS ABOUT WANTING TO FIND HER

BLACK OUTSIDE BUT YOUR WHITE INSIDE YOU DOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WENT THRULE AND THAT WAS THE END OF OUR PPOS THE FANDI EARLY YES YES YES BECAUSE IT SHOWED THAT WE WERE SO DIFFERENT AND HE SAID THAT WE WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND EACH OTHED SHE AGREED THEY ARE DIFFERENT PAIN POINTS IN RUSSIA SHE HADN'NT EXPERIENCE A KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL RACEISM HE HAD AND SHE SAID HER BOY FRIEND COULDN'T POSSIBLY FEEL THE THINGS THAT UPSET HER AS A RUSSIAN THE WAY SHE FELT THEM DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND AFRICAN AMERICAN LIKE THE THE SORT OF LIKE PAINPOINTS AR NO I UNDERSTAND THEM BUT I DON'T FEEL THEM THAT I DIFFERENCE THE THINGS THAT UPSETS ER LET'S SAY AFRICAN AMERICANS I CAN SEE WHY THAT UPSAYS BUT IT DOESN'T HER BHEN HE SAID TO YOU LIKE YOUR BLACK ON THE OUTSIDE BUT YOUR WAY ON THE INSIDE WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT I THOUGHT HE WAS STUPID I SAID HOW COULD I BE BLACK HN AND WHITE OIT INSIDE I AM I MEAN I'M WHOY AM AND THE THINGS THAT I WENT THROUGH YOU DON'T UNTO STAND DID YOU GIS EVER TALK ABOUT RACE BEFORE THAT THAT ARGUMENT THAT YOU HAVE IN THE RESTAURANT WAS THAT LIKE A CONVERSATION OU GAS HAD ARE NOT AT ALL NO HE NO WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT NO WITH DID IT  SURPRISE YOU WHEN IT

JUST TI SORT OF GIVE LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ARVE LIKE I CAN'T I CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER WHAT THE ATTEMPT WHAT THE INTENTION WAS SO I A I A NO OUT YOU AND I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT I DON'T WANT TO DAMAGE MY NERVE SYSTEM BY THINK ING ABOUT THAT IT I WILL NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH NOMBLE ONE NO BUT TO IT CAN BE BOTH NOT BUT TO IAT CAN BE BOTH AND NOT BUT THREE WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IT'S O INTERESTING THAT YOU SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT'S A THING WE DO ALL THE TIME IN AMERICA IS THAT WE WE REPLAY OUT THESE MOMENTS OF DISCOMFORT FOR EACH OTHER IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN FO WHAT FOR WHAT I HAD A MEANING WHAT IF YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU I'D DED THAT AND A RESULT AS IT RESULT THIS RESTAURANT WATZ WAS CLOSE FOR EXAMPLE OR ISN' RESULT THIS WATO WAS KICKED OUT THAT MAKE SENSE BUT WHY GOING THROUGH THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN WITHOUT ANY RESULTS WHY SCRETCHING THE PLACE TILL THE FIRST BLOOD ON YOUR BODY BUT BUT I THINK LIKE PART OF THE REASON WE DO IT IS TO RECOGNIZE THE LAKE THES THIS IS STILL HAT THIS IS HAPPENING LAKE WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING WE CAN'T PRETEND IT'S NOT HAPPENING YES I ACKNOWLEDGE IT BUT AGAIN IF I WAS WAS SIT DOWN AT HOME AND STOPED ALL THEY DID IT BECAUSE I'M JUISH NO THEY DID IT BECAUSE I'M BLACK NO THEY DID IT BECAUSE MY GRAND BAN RESAW AMERICAN NO THET DID IT BECAUSE ON THAT AND THAT AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NO END TO THAT I THINK FOR MANY BLACK AMERICANS THERE'S A CURIOSITY A NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLORER THAT CONSTANT UNEASE WY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I'M BLACK IS MY DOCTOR GIVING ME PROPER CARE BECAUSE I'M BLACK AN I HERE TO FILL A DIVERSITY QUOTA TBECASE I'M BLACK AND I BEING PULLED OVER PART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE BLACK HERE PART OF WHAT DRAWS US TOGETHER IS AN INVESTIGATION OF THAT DISCOMFORT THERE'S COM ME NO REASSURANCE IN THAT I KNOW THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT A MONOLET YET THE FACT THAT YOULINA DIDN'T HAVE THIS CURIOSITY SURPRISED ME BUT IT ALSO MADE SENSE YEULIN DI DIDN'T HAVE AN ECHO CHAMBER OF INJUSTICES GROWING UP I CAN TALK TO MY HER STYLIST MY TRAINER MY FAMILY ANS THEY HATE THIS THING HAPPENED YEULINA HAD NO COMMUNITY TO SHARE WIT NOBODYD TO COSINE HER PROBLEMS WERE NOT THOSE OF BLACK PEOPLE BUT HER OWN I WANT TO BE CLEAR BEING BLACK IS NOT SOME JOYLESS EXERCISE FOR ME I WOULDN'T TREAT IT FOR THE WORLD AN NOT MOVING ABOUT BUT YOULIN IS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING THINKING ABOUT RACE ALL THE TIME IS EXHAUSTING BUT I CAN'T LET IT GO AND I TRY TO EXPLAIN TO HER WHY I FEEL LIKE PART OF IT IS LIKE IT IT ALL IT THEYRE SMALL THINGS THAT I FEEL LIKE IN SOMEWAYS AT A TO ONE REALLY BIG PROBLEM THAT JUST STILL HASN'T BEEN SOLVED THAT IT'S LAKE IT'S SMALL THINGS THAT ATA TO FEELING LIKE YOU DON'T BELONG HERE THAT LIKE THE COUNTRY THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS EXISTED AND LIKE DOESN'T WANT YOU AND I I DON'T KNOW   I HAD THIS MER I HAD THIS DREAM THAT YES SOME WAR THERE WAS ANOTHER WORLD WHERE I BELONG T AND THIS IS AMERICA NOW WITH YOU I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE YOUR DREAM HOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE MI O A I I DON'T KNOW WERE I DON'T KNOW IT AT I TAD TO AD FRIGHT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT GOING TO AFRIC I DON'T ESN THINK IT'S NECESSARILY BACK TO AFRICA I THINK I DON'T KNOW IF THIS PLACE EXIST I THINK IT'S JUST THIS THIS PLACE IN SOMEWAY STILL DOESN'T ACCEPT ME AFTER ALL OF THIS THIS TIME AND THAT MAY BE THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS AND MAYBE THERE ISN'T ANOTHER PLACE AR BETTER OPTION DO YOU DO YOU THINK IT SILLY THAT I THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS SO MUCH YES I THINK THISS SILLY THAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT 'S SO MUCH THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO WASTE YOUR TIME ON THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT CHANGE AND DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THOSE PEOPLE IF THAT'S HOW THEY ARE BUT THAT YOU YOU DON'T I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO WASTE YOUR LIFE ON CHANGING THEM YOU JUST DROP THEM AND GO ON WITH YR YOUR LIFE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE THINGS YOU CANNOT CHANGE SOMETIMES I THINK YOLIAN IS RIGHT THAT I'M SILLY FOR OBSESSING OVER THIS STUFF ND I WONDER IF MAYBE SHE'S BETTER OFF FOR NOT HAVING SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE PUZZLING IN PICKING OVER EVERY IN HER ACTION WITH WHITE PEOPLE THAT MAYBE HER GRAND PARENTS MOVING TO THE UESSIS ARE HELPED HER BY PASS PARTS OF AMERICA'S PARTICULAR BRAND OF RACISM THUT MAYBE I NEVER REALLY HAD A CHOICE RACE SPECIFICALLY BLACK AND WHITE  SUCH AN INTRGAL PART OF LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY YELING ANSIST I HAD BIGGER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT BUT HONESTLY I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THAT AFFECTS ME MORE BEING A BLACK AMERICAN IS WHAT KEEPS ME FROM FEELING LIKE I TRULY BELONG IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE YOU EVER FELT LIKE YOU BELONG SOMEWHERE LIKE HAVE YOU EVER FOUND THAT PLACE AH YOU KNOW WHAT AH FOR ME IT'S NOT WEARE IT'S SMOR WITH HOME THAT'S WHAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME

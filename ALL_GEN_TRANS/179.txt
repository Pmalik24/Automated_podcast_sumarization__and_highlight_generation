COMSLASHMEN SO FINALLY THE OTHER SHOE DROPPED YESTERDAY JACKSMITH THE SPECIAL COUNCIL WHO IS APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE DONAL TRUMPS ACTIVITIES SURROUNDING THE ELECTION OF TWENTY TWENTY AND JANUARY SIX AN ALSO APPOINT DID TO BOOK IN TO HIS HANDLING OF CLASSFI DOCUMENTS E IS NOW FILED A SECOND CASE AGAINST A DONAL TRUMP THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT'S CASE IS GOING TO BE HELD DOWN IN FLORIDA NOW HE IS FILED TE FEDERAL INDICTMEN ELECTING MULTIPLE CRIMES WITH REGARD TO JANUARY SIX AND ELECTION TWENTY TWENTY ACCORDING TO THE WALLSTRATURNAL TRUMP WAS INDICTED TUESDAY AN AN UNPRESEDENT IN CRIMINAL CASE ACCUSING THE FORM PRESIDENT OF TRYING O SUBVERT THE WILL OF AMERICAN VOTERS THROUGH HIS ATTEMPTS TO CLING TO POWER AFTER HE LOST THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION HERE WAS AT JACKSMITH YESTERDAY ANNOUNCING THE INDICTMENT AND MAKE MNG IT ALL ABOUT TIOANUARY SIEX AND AS WE'LL SEE THIS IS SORT OF FASCINATING BECAUSE IT'S POLITICAL MEAN WHAT WHEN I SATE'S POLITICAL I DON'T JUST MEAN THAT HE IS SAYING THINGS THAT ARE POLITICAL IN NATURE I MEAN THAT THIS INDICTMENT ITSELF IS POLITICAL SEE AN ORDER FOR AN INDICTMENT TO ACTUALLY HAVE ANY TEETH THE CRIMES ARST THAT AR STATHRITORY NATURE THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIMES MUST BE FULFILL ALECTING THAT SOMEBODY DID A BAD THING TO YOU DOESN'T MAKE IT A RIME IF I SAY SOMETHING MEAN TO YOU YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT I MAY BEING A JER BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I JUST COMMTTED A CRIME A CRIME IS A STATUE TORALLY DEFYING THING AND YEFT THO HIT THE ELEMENTS OF THAT CRIME IN ORDER FORED TO GO TO JAIL OVER THAT CRIME THE PROBLEM IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS THAT THEY'RE LOT OF THINGS THAT ELOD PEOPLE ALIKE ABALADONAL TRUMP DID BETWEEN THE ELECTION OF TWENTY TWENTY AND JANUARY SEX I THINK FOR EXAMPLE HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH WHEN HE'S SUGGESTED THAT THE ELECTION HAD ACTUALLY BEEN ONE BY HIM THAT FORMAL VOTER FRAUD NOT JUST YOU KNOW MEDEA RIGGING THE ELECTION THROUGH IN FORMAL MEANS OR CHANGING OF VOTERALS BUT ACTUAL FORMAL VOTER FRAUD CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION I THINK HE KNEW THAT WAS NOT TRUE AND I THING THAT HE WAS LYING ABOUT THAT BUT I CAN'T PROVE IT NOT ONLY CAN I NOT PROVE IT THE EVIDENCE YOU KNOW AGAIN IS SOMEWHAT SPECULATIVE BECAUSE MAYBE HE TRULY BELIEVED IS GN BE HIS DEFENCE THAT VOTER FRAUD DID TO SIDE THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION I THINK THAT DONAL TRUMP DED SOMETHING THAT WAS FRANKLY FALSE ANDI THING THAT HE WAS LYING TO PEOPLE WHEN HE SUGGESTED BETWEEN THE ELECTION AND JANUARY SIX THET MIGHT PENCE HAD THE UNALATERAL ABILITY TO OVERTURN ELECTION RESULTS THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE CONSTITUTION IS WRITTEN HOWEVER COULD THERE BE A LEGAL THEORY TO THAT EXTENT THAT DONAL TRUMP ACTUALLY BELIEVED SURE THERE COULD BE ME THINKING THE DONAL TRUMP DID A BAD THING DOES NOT MAKE THE BAD THING A CRIME AND WHEN YOU START MAKING BAD THINGS OF CRIME THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE A CRIME FREE SPEECH A CRIME SPEECIOUS LEGAL THEORY'S A CRIME NOW YOU'RE ENCROACHING ON ACTUAL AMERICAN FREEDOMS JUST TO GET DONAL TRUMP AND THAT'S WHAT JACKSMITH IS DOING HERE BECAUSE AS WE'LL SEE EN   GO THROUGH THE INDICTMENT IN GREAT TO TAIL TODAY AS WE'LL SEE THE THINGS THAT JACKSMITH IS ELEGIONG ARE MAINLY THINGS THAT ARE JUST LIKE NOT GOOD LIKE NOT GOOD THINGS THAT ARE NOT PROVABLE CRIMES AND HE IS STRETCHING THE DEFINITION OF CRIMES TO FIT THOSE NOT GOOD THINGS BECAUSE HE HAD A MAN DATE IS ALL SPECIAL COUNCILS DO WHICH IS INDICT AND AS THE OLD SAN GOS ONCE YOU GET A CASE IN FRONT OF GRANJURY THOES A A HANDSAND A HAMSTANDWICH AND FOR JACKSMTH WHO'S BRINGING THIS CASE IN WASHINGTON YOU SEE IT'S ALMOST BEING TREATED I THINK LEGALLY AS A BACK UP TO THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CASE IN FLOORID CLASSIFIE DOCUMENTS CASE IN FLORIDA IS MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL THREATS ADONAL TRUMP BECAUSE HE APPEARS TO FULFILLED THE ELEMENTS OF TE CRIME LEV ASIDE THE DOUBLE STANDAR WITH HILLERY CLINTON IF YOU ARE JUST A JURY LOOKING AT WHETHER DONALD TFROM DID THE THINGS ALLEGED IN THE INDICTEMENT AND DO THOSE FULFIL THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME WITH REGARD TO CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THE ANSWER IS LIKELY YES IN THE STATE OF FLOORIDTO THE PROBLEM FOR JACKSMETH IS IT'S IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA YOU MAY GET A JUR WHO'S GOING TO BASEDLY SAY I DON'THIN IT'S FAR THE OR TRYING HIM AT ALL AND SON ONE TO VOTE TO A QUET SO THE BACK UP IS FILE A BUNCH OF REAL STRETCH CHARGES IN WASHINGTON YOU SEE WHERE EVERYBODY HATES DONAL TRUMPS GOTS AND HOPE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SEND HIM TO JAIL ON THOSE BASIES SAME THINK THAT MANHATTON D A IS DOINK OVER IN MANHATTON WITH REGARD TO THESE RISDICULOUS STORMY DANIELS CHARGES YOU'S FIGURING TO MAN HATTAND JURY THEY HATE DONAL TRUM THE PUT IM IN JAIL AND THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS TO SEEM INCREDIBLY POLITICAL AGAIN NOT JUST POLITICAL BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS POLITICAL A POLITICAL INCENSE THAT THERE IS AN

PARTICIPATION IN EN'S PAGE TWO OF THE INDICTMENT QUOTE SHORTLY AFTER ELECTIONDAY THE DEFENDENT PURSUIT ONLAWFUL MEANS O DISCOUNTING LEGITIMATE VOTES AND SUBVERTIG TH ELECTION RESULTS IN DOING SO THE DEFENDENT PERPERTRATED THREE CRIMINAL CONSPIRACIES ONE A CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED STATES BY USING DISHONESTY FRAUD AND SEAT TO IM PAIRE OBSTRUCT AND DEFEATS THE LAWFUL FEDERAL GOVERMENT FUNCTION BY WHICH THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ARE COLLECTED COUNTED AND SERIFIED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT VIOLATION OFE EIGHTEEN U S COD SECTION THREE  SEVENTY OND K THAT IS NOT WHAT THE STATUTE IS FOR SO THE STATUTE IS FOR THIS STATUTE HISTORICALLY SPEAKING HAS BEEN ABOUT STEALING MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THES IS A REAL STRETCH CHARGE HA IF YOUARE GOING TO IT ACCUSE DONAL TRUMP AFFRAUD THIS IS NOT CRIMINAL FRAUD AS NATIONAL VIEW POINTS OUT QUOTE AS THE SUPREME COURT REFROM JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO FRAUD AND FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAW IS A SCHEME TO SWINDLE VICTIMSTOUT OF MONEY OR TANGUAL PROPERTY MENDACIOUS RETERIC IN SEEKING TORATAIN POLITICAL OFFICE IS DAMINABLE BUT IT IS NOT CRIMINAL FRAUD OH THAT IS WHAT SMITH IS CHARGE INDEED A SUMING A PROSECUTOR COULD PROVE BEONDER REASONABLE DOUBT TRUMP HADNT ACTUALLY CON VINCED HIMSELF THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM HIM HI PURPALLY AND EVEN WORSE ARE PROTECTED POLITICAL SPEECH SO AGAIN THE NOTION THAT IT IS DEFRAUDING THE UNITED STATES NOT LIKE YOU STOLE MONEY FROM THE POST OFFICE LIKE OR EM BEZZLED FROM THE E P  BUT HIM ACTIVELY CHALLENGING THE EL TION BEYOND THE TIME WHEN BE CONSTITUTION SAYS THE STATE CERTIFY THAT THAT AMOUNTS TO FRAUD AND NO IT DOESN'T FULFIL THAT CRIMINAL STATUE O GAY THAT'S CONSPIRACY NUMBER ONE THEIR LEGING CONSPIRCIY NUMBER TO IT CONSPIRACY TO CORRUPTLY OBSTRUCT AND IMPEDE THE JANURISIX CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDING AT WHICH THE COLLECTED RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ARE COUNTED AND CERTIFIED IN VIOLATION OF EIGHTEEN U S CODE FIFTEEN TWELVE CAY CASE O HERE THE IDEA IS THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO OBSTRUCT AND IMPED A PROCESS OF JUSTICE GOING FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WHEN WHEN THEY SED OBSTRUCTION JUST AS I THAUD TAT THE CHARGES YOU'RE BEFORE THEY RELEASE THEM I THOUGHT MAYBE WHAT THE CHARGE WEN TO BE IS THE DONALD TRUMP CALLED UP WITNESSES AND THREATENE THEM TO LIE HE SAID I WANT YOU TO LIE TO THE GENEROUS EX COMMITTEE OR I WANT YOU TO LIE TO THE JACKSMITHS OFFICE IN THIS PROCEEDING THEY RENE ALLEGE ANY OF THAT WHEN THEY SAY OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE HERE WHAT THEY MEAN IS THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO OBSTRUCT THE LEGAL COUNTING OF THE VOTES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE FOR THAT WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT HE HAD A SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORY AND HE ARTICULATED A LOT THAT DOES NOT AMOUNT TO OBSTRUCTION A OBSTRUCTION WOULD BE I WILL THREATEN YOU WITH A THING I'M N O THREATEN YOU WITH DEATH I'M N A THREATEN YOUR FAMILY I'M A THREATENED THINGS IN ORDER TO STOP YOU FROM DOING THE THING WHAT'S THE THREAT WHERE IS IT CAVE THAT THE ELEMENTS ARE NOT FULFILLED HERE T WILL GO THROUGH THE NIHT ME YEL THEY'RE NOT EVEN ALLEGED AND THIS IS MY BIGEST PROBLEM YET YOU CAN TELL WHEN A CASES BULLCRAP BY WHAT EXACTLY IS BEING ALLEGED AN SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GO BACK TO THE DERIK SHOVEN CRIMINAL CASE I KEPT POINTING OUT THAT THE ENTIRE MEDEA THE ENTIRE COUNTRY  KEPT SAYING THIS TAE CASE ABOUT RACE AND I KEPT SAYING IT'S NOT EVEN A LEGED IN QUART THAT THIS THE CASE ABOUT RASE SOHEN THERE'S A GAP BETWEN THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF A CASE ION WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEING ALLEGED WELL THEN YOU CAN TELL AT THE CASE OF SPECIOUS THE SAME THING IS TRUE WITH REGARD TO DONALD TRUMPS CASE ABOUT ELECTION FRAUD I KEPT POINTING OP THAT DONALD TRUMP DID NOT EVEN LEGALLY ALLEGE THE FRAUD THAT HE KEPT SAYING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OVER AND OVER AND COURT WHICH MEANS THERE'S A GAP WHICH MEANS SOMEBODY IS NOTBING HONEST OKA WELL THEY ARE ALLEGING HERE THAT DONALD TRUMP OBSTRUCTED JUSTISE AND THEN THEY PROVIDE NO EVIDENCE OF THE ACTUAL OBSTRUCTIOR'S NO ALLIGATION THAT MATCHES THE CRIME THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO INDICTE HIM ON THAT CAP MEANS SOMEBODY IS BEING DISHONESTON IN THIS CASE ITS JACK SMITH AND FINALLY A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND TO HAVE ONE'S VOTE COUNTED IN VIOLATION OF EIGHTEEN YUS COD TO FORTY ONE AGAIN THIS DOES NOT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT INTERPRETATION OF LAW AT NT EVEN REMOTELY THIS LALL WAS WRITTENAS THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS WRITTEN THE AFTRMOUTH OF THE CIVIL WAR TO STOP A SENTUALLY WHITE RACSIS FROM PREVENTING BLACK PEOPLE FROM VOTING OR THROWING THE VOTES IN THE RIVER OR SOMETHING AS HOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE IF YOU HAVE A SPECIOUS LEGAL CASE AND I ENS OPT NOT BEING VERIFIED BY A QUART THAT DOES NOT MEAN U VIOLATED THE LAW IF THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT EVERY TIME I ADVANCE A LEGAL THEORY AND THE LEGAL THEORY ENDS UP NOT BEING JUSTIFIED BY A COURT SOMEHOW I HAVE CONSPIRED AGAINST THE RIGHT TO VOTE BUT THAT THAT MEANS I CAN'T EVERFILE A VOTER CASE  MEAN BUT BY THIS PARTICULAR CASE EVERY TIME DEMOCRAT'S FILE A JERRY MANDRING CASE ON SOME LEGAL THEORY AND THEY GET OVERRULED THEN PRESUMABLY THEY'VE NOW CONSPIRED TO EY TO PREVENT SOMEBODY'S RIGHT TO VOTE BECAUE THE GERY MANDURING WAS LEGAL AND THEY SAID THE GERMANNERING WAS ILLEGAL BUT THEN THAT WAS TURNED DOWN SO OVIOUS LHY ORETRYING TO DEPRIVE SOMEBODY OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WAW THAT'S NOT HOW ANY OF THAT WORKS ADVANCING SPECIOUS LE GAL THEORIES IS FULLY PROTECTED BY THE FIRST EMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WILL GET TO MORE OF THE INDICTMENT IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST IF YOU'E UNA SMALL BUSINESS IN YOU TO PLAN AHEAD ONE OF BUST WAYS TO DO THT AS BY

STATES THE FRAUD STATURE DOESN'T APPLY AT CONSPIRACY TO OBSTRUCK JUSTICE THAT DOESN'T APPLY BECAUSE SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORES THAT YOU ATTEMPT TO ADVANCE THAT'S THAT'S NOT OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE AND A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE RGHT TO VOTE AND STOPPING PEOPL FROM HAVING THE VOTES COUNTED AGAIN A SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORY DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOW VIOLATED SOMEBODY'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT'S NOT WHAT ANY OF THAT MEANS IF THEN WE GET TO SOMEOF THE ACTUAL ALLIGATIONS IN THE INDICTMENT SO THEY SAY THE DEFENDANS CONSPIRACY TO IMPAR OBSTRUCTION DEFEAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUNCTION THROUGH DISHONESTY FRAUD IN SEAT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING MANNER AND MEANS FIRST THE DEFENDENT AND CO CONSPIRATORS USED KNOWINGLY FALSE CLAIMS O ELECTION FRAUD TO GET STATE LEGISLATORS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS TO SUBVERT THE LEGITIMATE ELECTION RESULTS AND CHANGE ELECT TORAL VOTES FOR OF THE DEFENDENT'S OPPONENT JO BYDON TO ELECTORAL VOTES FOR THE DEFENDENT THAT IS ON THE PRETEXT OF BASELESS FRAUD CLAIMS THAT DIFENDEN PUSHED OFFICIALS AN CERTAIN STATES TO IGNORE THE POPULAR VOTE DISAN FRANCH HAS MILLIONS VOTERS DISMISS LEGITIMATE ELECTORS AND ULTIMATELY CAUSE THE ASCERTAINMENT OF AND VOTING BY ILLEGENT MAT ELECTORS IN FAVOR OF DEFENDEN OCASE SO YOU THERE'S A KEYWORD IN THAT PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH KNOWINGLY KNOWINGLY FALSE CLAIMS OF ELECTION FRAUD SO THE'RE NEVER REALS HAVE TIME WITH THIS ONE THAT TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUT THE DONAL TRUMP ABSOLUTELY KNEW THAT THE ELECTION FRAUD CLAMS WERE FALSE NOT TAD HE SHULD HAVE KNOWN NOTE THE PEOPLE TOLD HIM TBUT THAT HE ACTIVELY KNEW THAT THE ELECTION FRAUD CLAIMS WERE FALSE AND HE PROMOTED THEM ANYWAY FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL BENEFIT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND TRUM FO BASICALLY SET AS MOTRIHT BUILL STEPYIN FORMAR CAMPAIGN MANAGER THAT BUNCH PEOPLE A ROUN TRUMP HAVE SAID YET WE KNEW THAT THIS KENNIS STUFF WAS NOT TRUE AND WE ARE STILL PROMOTING IT TO THE PUBLIC BUT BY W DO THEYMEAN THAT DONALD TRUMP PERSONALLY TOLD THEM THAT ELEGATIONS ON A CLODING TH INDENTMENT IF IT WERE IF THERE ARE SOME ALLEGATION HERE A WITNESS SAID DONAL TRUM TOLD ME YE I LOST THE ELECTION DO IT ANYWAY THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR DONALD TRUMP IF THEY SAID I IF THERE ARE TAPE LEKE THERE IS N'N CLASSFI DOCUMENTS CASE RAYS LIKE I KNOW LOS THE ELECTION THE ELECTION FRUDGS OF THIS GRAB THAT'S DO IT AT ANYWAY JOBIN GABYBRE  THAT WOULD BE A PROM FOR HIM KNOWINGLY IS A VERY HIGH STANDARD IT REQUIRES INTENT AND AS I'VE SAD FOR A VERY LONG TIME ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF TE UNITED STATES IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH IN TENT FOR DONALD TRUMP ON INTENT CRIMES VERY TOUGH BECAUSE AGAIN HIS INTENT SHIFTS MOMENT TO MOMENT LIK ALMOST EVERY DAY HE SHIFTS HIS INTENT AND HE FULLY BELIEVES THE TING THAT HE IS SAYING TODAY AND HE FULLY BELIEVE THE THING TAT HE WAS SAYING YESTERDAY TE B THE EFENDINE ND CO CONSPIRATORS ORGANIZED FRAUGULANC SELIES OELECTORS AND SEVEN TARGETED STATES AT TEMPTING TO MIMIC THE PROCEDURS THAT THE LEGITIMATE ELECTORS WERE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THIS INCLUDED CAUSING THE FRAUGULNTS ELECTORS TO MEET ON THE DAY APPLINTED BY FEDERAL LAW ON WHICH LEGITIMATE ELECTORS WERE TO GATHER AND CAST THEIR VOTES  CAST FRAUGULAND VOTES FOR THE DEFENDANT HEN SIN CER DIFVICATS FALSELY REPRESENTING THEY WERE THELEGION RN ELECTORS  SOM FRAUGULANS ELECTORS WRE TRICT INTO PARTICIPATING BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING THER VOTES WOULD B USED ONLY IF THE DEFENDED SUCCEEDED AND OUTCOME DETERMINATIVE LOSIGE WITHIN THEIR STATE WHICH THE DEFENDENT NEVER DID THE DEFENDINAND CO CONSPIRATORS THEN CRAUS THESE FRAUDGULAND ELECTORS TO TRANSMIT THEIR FALSE CERTIFICATES TO THE V P GEY AGAIN THAT'S A SPECIOUS LEGAL CLAIM AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS NOTHING NOTHING IF DON TRUMP CONVINCES ME TO WRITE A LETTER TO MY CONGRESS PERSON THREATENING THET IF MY CONGRESS PERSON DOES NOT DO X WHY OR Z I'D BECOME THE LEGAL CONGRESS PERSON FROM THAT DISTRICT THAT IS A FRAUGULENT LEGAL CLAIM THAT HAS NO MERIT IS THAT A CRIME HARD TO SAY THAT THAT'S A CRIME IT'S A SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORY SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORIES ARE FULLY PROTECTED HERE IN THE UNITED STATESTO AMERICAT WHERE THEY WERE UNTIL FIVE MINUTS AGO SEE THE DEFENDIN AND CO CONSPIRATORS ATTEMPTED TO USE THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF THE DO J TO CON DUCT SHAM ELECTION CRIME INVESTIGATIONS ANDTASEND A LETTER TC THE TARGETED STATES THAT FALSELY CLAIM THAT THE DOJ HAD IDENTIFIEDS SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT MAY HAVE IMPACTED THE ELECTION OUT COME THAT SOUGHT TO ADVANCE THE DEFFENDENCS FRAUDULANTE ELECTOR PLAN BY USING THE DOJE'S AUTHORITY TO FALSELY PRESENT FRAUGULANTE ELECTORS AS A VALID ALTERNATIVE AND URGED ON BEHALF OF THE DO J THE TARGEDED STATES LEGISLATORS TO CONVENE TO CREATE TH OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE THE FRAUDULANTE ELECTORS OVER HE LEGITIMATE ELECTORS NOW GEN ALL THIS IS REALLY BAD STOFF RIGHT IT'S N IT'S SUCH A SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORY IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORY IN ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE ALSO DD ANY OF THIS CONSTITUTE CRIME IF DON TRUMP SANS TO A LOWER LEVEL MEMBER OF THE DOJS THE'S WHAT'S ACTUALLY ELEGE I WANT YOU TO SEND A LETTER TO THI STATE OMECH AGAIN AND TELL THEM THAT THERE I'S FRAD AN THEN THAT LOWER AN MEMBER OF THE DOJ WENT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL BILLBORN SAID LET'S DO IT AND MILBAR SAYS NO THERE'S NO EVIENCE OF THAT AND THEN THE LETTER NEVER GETS SENT IS THAT CRIME IS IT VERY DFICULT TO SAY THAT THAT'S CRIME THAT THAT FULFILS THE ELEMENT OF FORGEN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE D THE DEFENDIN AND CO CONSPIRATORS ATTEMPTED TO ENLIST THE V P TO USE THE CEREMONIAL ROLL AT THE JANUARY SIX  SORTIFICATION PROCEEDING TO FRAG GONALTLY ALTER OF THE ELECTION RESULTS AND THIS IS MY FARPART IT SAYS THAT THEY USED A KNOWINGLY FALSE CLAIMS OF ELECTION FRAUDICASO AGAIN THEY KEEP GOING TO KNOWINGLY AS VERY HARD TO ASTABLISH WHEN THAT FAILED ON THE MORNING OF JANUARY SIX THE DEFENDANT AND CO CONSPIRATORS REPEATED KNOWING LHY FALSE CLAMS OF ELECTION PROUGHT TO GATHERED SUPPORTERS FALSELY TOLD THEM THE V P HAD THE AUTHORITY TO AND MIGHT ALTER THE ELECTION RESULTS AND DIRECTED THEN TO THE CAPITAL TO OBSTRUCT THE CERTIFICATION PROCEEDING AND EXERT PRESSURE ON THE VICE PRESIDENT THEY DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE OF THIS THEY DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE THAT HE DIRECTED THEM TO OBSTRUCT THE CERTIFICATION PROCEEDING I CAN NEVER TOLD THEM TO GO INTO THE CAPITAL BUILDING HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT TELL HIM TO GO IN TO THE CAPITAL WE SALT WE'RE ALL THERE RIGHT AND FINALLY AFTER BECAME PUBLIC ON THE AFTERNOON OF GANUAR SIXTH OF PE WOULD NOT FRAUDULENTLHE ALTOR THE ELECTION RESULTS A LARGE AND ANGRY CROWD INCLUDING MANY INDIVIDUALS DEFENDIN HAD SEVED INTO BELIEVING THE V P COULD AND MIGHT CHANGE TH ELECTION RESULTS BLIOLENTLY ATTACK THE CAPITAL AND HALT IN THE PROCEEDINGS AS VIOLENCE ENSUED THE EFENDANT AND CO CONSPIRATORS EXPLOITED THE DESTRUPTION BY RE DOUBLING EFFORTS TO LEVEE FALSE CLAIMS OF ELECTION FRAUD AND COMMINCE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO FURTHER DELAY THE CERTIFICATION BASED ON THOSE PLANES AGAIN NOT A CRIME NOT A CRIME BAD UGLY UN PRESEDENTIAL NOT A CRIME IT WILLGET TO MORE OF THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST I HAD A LATE NIGHT LAST NIGHT WE HAD A BACK STAGE LIVE IN NASTAL AND IHAD TO FLY BACK TO MY HOUSE IN FLORIDA NOWI'M AT THE OFFICE TO DAY I'M TIRED I'M RELYING A LACK REFFLE COFFEE MAT  KNOWS I KNEW MY BLACK REFFLE COFFEE EVERY MORNING BLACK REFFLE COFFEE LITERALLY FUELS THE DAILY WIRE OUR OFFICE DRINKS ABOUT FORITY

LIKE DONALD TRUMP WANTED TO FIR SOMEBODY AND THEN DIDN'T RIT THIS IS ONE OF THE ALLIGATIONS THAT IS MADE ABOUT THE D O J THAT HE'S PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE D O JA TO SEND CERTA LETTERS AND HE THREATEN TO FIRE HIS A G ONESTLY ONE F TH ONE O THE THINGS THAT THET TRUMP DID REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS THREATEN TO FIRE PEOPLE AND THEN WHEN IT TURNED OUT THAT E CULDN'T LEGALLY FIRE THE PERSON OR CREATE SIGNIFICANT BLOWBACK WHO JUST NOT FIRE THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE I'M PAGE THIRTY ONE OF THE INDICTMENT IT SAYS QUOTE AT A MEETING IN THE ALL THE OFFICE ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY THIRD CO CONSPIRATOR FORCE SUGGESTED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHULD O PINE THE V P COULD EXCEED HIS LAWFL AUTHORITY DURING THE CERTIFICATION PROCEEDING AND CHANGED THE ELECTION OUT COM WHEN THEASSISTANT  G FOR

CONVERSATION O KATE AND AND AND SO LIKE ALL RIGHT SO AN DUM AT A CERTAIN POINT HERE ON DESEMBER ON GENURY THIRD THE DEFENDMANT MET WITH THA BRIEF FING ON AN OVERSEES NATIONAL SECURI THE ISSUE IT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIECE OF STAFF TAND OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS THE CHAIRMAN BRIEF TE DEFENDANTS ON THAT PAR TICULAR ISSIUNE WHEN THE CHAIRMAN ANOTHER ADVISER RECOMMENDED THE DEFENDEN TAKE NO ACTION BECAUSE THE INAUGURATION WAS SEVENTEEN DAYS AWAY THE DEFENDANT SAID QUOTE YADYAR WRITE ITS TOO LATE FOR US WERE CON GIVE THAT TO THE NEXT SKY THAT'S A CRIME WET WET WWHERE'S THE CRIME I'M

OVER THIS IS JUST LIKE HERE'S A LIST OF BAD THINGS THE DONAL FROM DID I AGREE OTALL TINGS REALLY BAD I DON'T THINK THEY ARE WORTHY OF A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ALSO NOT A CRIME SO THE THE THE MOST SPECIOUS PART OF THIS PARTICULAR INDICTMENT IS WHEN YOU GET TO THE ACTUAL EVENTS OF JANUARY SIX LISTEN TO THE DESCRIPTION IN THE INDICTMEN OF JANUARY SIX AND SEE IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHERE THE CRIME OCCURS HAKE IS REMEMBER THIS IS AN INDICTMENT IT'S NOT DESCRIPTION THE BAD STUFF YOU KNOW ABOUT HE BAD STUFF IN EFACT THE BAD STUFF IS PROBABLY THE REASON THAT REPUBLICANS HAT A REAL TOUGH TIMEIN THE LAST MID FROMALECTION THERE ARE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES TO ALL THIS IT'S ALSO THE REASON WHY HE WAS NEARLY IMPEACHED AND CONVICTED IN THE SENATE HAKE HERE WE GO  SHORTLY BEFORE ONE PIM THE VICE PRESIDENT ISSUE O PUBLIC STATEMEN EXPLAINING THAT HIS ROLE AS PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE AT THE CERTIFICATION PROCEEDING WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN AND DID NOT INCLUDE UNALADERAL AUTHORITY TO DETURMAN WHICH ELECTORAL VOTES SHOULD BE COUNTED WHICH SHOULD NOT TBEFORE THE DEFENDENT HADFINISHE SPEAKING CROWD BEGAN TO GATHER ATHE CAPITAL THEREAFTER A MASS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD TRAVELLED TOO WASHINGTON AND TO THE CAPITAL AT THE DEFENDENCE DIRECTION BROKE THROUGH BARRIERS CORDONING OFF THE CAPITAL GROUNDS AN ADVANCED ON THE BUILDING INCLUDING BY VIOLENTLY AE CACKING LAWN FORCEMEN OFFICERS TRYING TO SECURE IT THE DEFENDANT WATCHD DEVENCE O THE CAPITAL UN FOLD ON THE TEVE IN THE DINING OOM NEXT TO THE OVAL OFFICE HAY NOW THERE'S BEEN NO ALLIGATION ANYWHERE IN THIS INDICTMENT THE DONAL TRUMP TOLD PEOPLE TO BREAK INTO THE CAPITAL AND VIOLENTLY ASSALT POLICE OFFICERS THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT BEING CHARGED WITH INCITEMENT IF HE HAD THAT'S AN ACTUAL CRIME HE IS NOT BEING CHARGE WITH AT TWO THIRTEEN AFTER MORE THAN AN HOUR OF STEADY VIOLENCE ADVANCEMENT THE CROWD OF THE CAPITAL BROKE INTO THE BUILDING UPON RECEIVING NEWS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAD BREACHED THE CAPITAL THE DEFENDANT'S ADVISER'S TOLD THEM THERE WAS A RIOT THERE AND RIDERS HAD REACHED THE BUILDING WHEN EVISERERS URGED THE DEFENDENT TOE ISSUE A CALMING MESSAGE AIMED AT THE RIOTERS THE DEFENDIN REFUS INSTEAD REPEATEDLY REMARKING THAT THE PEOPLE AT THE CAPITAL WERE ANGRY BECAUSE THE ELECTION HAVE BEEN STOLEN NOW I'VE A QUESTION BAD IS THAT A CRIME IS THAT A CRIME THAT HE DIDN'T SAY A THING ON TWITTER I'M I'M WONDERING HOW SO I MEAN THEIR DESCRIPTIONS OF ACTIVITIES HERE ABOUT THINGS LIKE DONALD TRUMPET READS WEETING THINGS RETREATING THINGS IS NOT A CRIME AS YOU MAY KNOW IF RETREATING THOS FOR A CRIME I' I BE IN JAIL FOR LIFE I RETREE THINGS ALL THE TIME AGAIN IT'S A DESCRIPTION OF LOTABAD STUFF AND ITS NOT DESCRIPTION OF CRIME AND THAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS PARTICULAR INDICTEMENT WHICH IS HONESTLY JACK'S MISHOUL BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF IT'S IT'S IT'S GREEGIOUS AND I S IN FACT IT ASALT ON PARTICULAR RIGHTS BECAUSE WHEN YOU OVER CHARGE AND THOSE CHARGES VIOLATE THINGS LIKE THE FIRST AMENDMENT WERE THE RIGHT TO PURVAY LEGAL THEORIES EVEN IF THEY ARE SPECIOUS WHAT YOU ARE DOING S YOU AR SAING TO EVERYBODY ELSE THAT THEIR FIRST MEN IN ACTIVITIES MAY NOT BE PROTECTED THIS IS GOING TO BE THE DEFENCE BY THE WAY N THAT DONE THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS GON ROLL OUT THE GAN ROLL OUT ISSENTIALLY YO DEFENCE IS ONE WHEN IT COMES TO DID TRUM ET KNOWINGLY KNOWINGLY ATTEMPT TO PURVAY ELECTION FRAUD THE GOIGTO SAY KNOWINGLY IS A REAL STRONGWORD AN IN FACT WHA THEY GONGTO DO IS THERE GING TO RELITIGATE THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION AND THE GNGTO SAY THERE A LOT OF REASONS FOR DONS FROM TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS ELECTION FRIGHT OUT IT MAY BE THAT THERE WAS NO ELECTION FRAUDS THE EXSENTEDONTROM WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT TO PRETEND THAT NO CREDIBLE PERSON COULT IVE EVER BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS ANY ELECTION FRAUD THAT'S A STRATCH THES EXACTLY JOHN LAUREL HIS LAWYER IS SAYING HERE HET WAS YESTERDAY UWHAT ABOUT THE STORIES THAT TO THESE CAMPAGN FONDS ARE NOW PAYING FOR LEGAL FEES SENITS AND HE RUNT ADD O CASH AND THAT FROUT WELL I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THAT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE WAY THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE OUT TONAL TRUMPAS THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS SO HE'S BEING FORCED TO SPEND MONEY ON LEGAL DEFENCE WHICH SHOULD BE SPENT ON THE DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL IDEAS AND CRITICAL ISSUES PEOPLE WANT TO HERE THE ISSUES THEY DON'T WANT A RELITICA TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL I SHOULD SAY MERIGORLAND MERIGORLAND AND THE BIGN ADMINISTRATION HAD TO SIGN OFF ONIS INDITEBET AND WHAT THEY'VE REALLY DONE IS INFITED NOW A REALIDICATION OF TWNTY TWENTY BUT THIS TIME IN A CRIMINAL COURT WHICH IS UNPRECEDENT IT NAY SO WHAT AE THE GING O DO THING TO BRING UP A BUNCH OF CHARGES THE TRUMP ADE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THETDEFENCE IS GON TO BE WELL I MEAN DID IT WOULD DE HAVE TO BE CRAZY TACTUALLY YOUN CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE CHARGES WHAT THE INDIGTMENT SAS IS A MUNCH PEOPLE TOLD DONALD TRUMP THAT THE ELECTION FROUGT THING WASN' TRUE DOES THAT MEAN THE TONAL TRUM HAD TO BELIEVE THEM HOW MANY TIMES HIF YOU BEN TOLD THAT A THING ISN'T TRUE MANY TIMES I D MANSION ACROSS THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE DID YOU BELIEVE IT EVERYTIMESOME WE TOLD YOU A THING WASN'T TRUE PRESUMEG A BELIEVE SOME HIMES YOU BELE DIDN'T SOMEHIMES YOU DIDN'T THEYAV TO PROVE IN TATS THAT IS POINT NUMFER ONE WHAT NEVER DO IS HE'S GONG TO SAY AT THE LOT OF THE ACTIVITY IS JUS PROTECTED FOR SPEECH WHICH IS CLEARLY TRUE HERE'S LAUREL EXPLANING YOR MIN I'S ON TAPE WIT THE FORMER BUT THE SECRETARY STATE FROM THE STATE OF TORGE TO ASKING HIM TO FIND HIM ONE MORE VOTE THAT HE WOULD NEED TO WIN THE STATE THAT'S NOT ASKING FOR A POCE'S ASING FOR VOTES THAT HE DID NOT GET IN THAT WEY WIASKING FOR THE  SECRETARY STATE TO IDENTIFI VOTES THAT WERE NOT COUNTED PROPERLY AND FACTOR THAT IN AND BY THE WAY THAT THAT DIS CUSSION TOOK PLACE WITH DOSENS OF PEOPLE ON A FONE CALV WITH LAWYERS INVALVED AND NO ONE WAS SUGGESTING DOING ANYTHING I LEGAL AND NO ONE DURING THAT CAULS AT MISTER PRESIDENT THAT'S BEYOND THE BOUNDS THIS IS POLITICS THIS INDICTMENT IS ABOUT PURE POLITICS WE ENGAGE IN VIGOROUS TOBATE IN THIS COUNTRY ABOUT POLITICS WUT WE DON'T DO HIS CRIMINALIZE POLITICAL SPEECH THIS INDICTMENT IS A GAME CHANGER IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE TAKEN POLITICAL SPEECH AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO CRIMINALIZE IT WHY THE PARTY THAT'S IN CONTROL AGAINST THE PARTY THAT'S CONTESING THE NEXT SELECTION WE'RE THE TWO INDIVIDUALS AN FAL FTER GONTO BE RUNNING FOR OFFICE TAT IS AN INCREDIBLE CET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AMEAN IT IS INFACT INCREDIBLE AND THE DO J BEING WEAPONIZED AGAINST THE CHIEF POLITICAL OPPONENT OF THE CURM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WELL THAT SAME DEOJA WAS TRYING TO CUT A BACK DOOR SWEETHARD DEAL WITH THE PRESIDENTS SON IS A WILD SPECTACL AND IT IS GOING T BE THE CENTR PIECE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOR ELECTION IF DONAL TRUM ENDS UP BEING THE NOMINY A' GETS A SORT OF THE EFFACTS OF THIS ON BOTH THE PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL LECTION IN A LITTLE BIT BUT THE FACTS REMAINS THAT THIS INDICTMENT IS REALLY SPECIOUS IT'S REALLY REALLY SPECIOUS AGAN NATIONAL OF  WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A PUBLICITION KNOWN FOR BEING TRUMP FRIENDLY NATURALLY IS FULL EDITORIAL TO DAY TALKING BOUT THIS NDICTMEN SHOULD BE TOSSED AND AND BY THE WAY EVEN OF TRUMPER CONVICTED ON SOME OF THESE CHARGES THERE'S A GOOD SHOP THAT SPRINCOURT OVERTURNS THE CHARGES THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PROPERLY FORMULATED JACKSMITH'S INTIRE INDITING STRATEGY HERE IS JANUARYSIX IS SUPERBAD THERE'S MUCH A CRAP OM O A THRO AGAINST THE WALL THAT IS NOT IN INDICTMENT' STRATEGY AND HERE'S THE THING JACKSMITH KNOWS BETTER SO UP UNTIL THIS POINT I'VE SAID WITH REGARD TO JACKSMETH JACKSMITH IS A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IT'S HIS JOB FIDENSIFY CRIMES IN CHARGE THEM IF HE SEES OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE OF A CRIME HAPPENING IT'S NOT HIS JOB TO UN DO AT GIMS COMY DID WRONGLY IN ALLOWING HILLERY CLENTENOUGH THE HOOK AND TWENTY SIXTEENORAL CLASSFI DOCUMENTS IT'S HIS JOB TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ELEMENT OR CRIME ARE FULFILLED AND THEN TO CHARGE THEM SO WHEN IT COMES TO FOR EXAMPLE THE CLASS FY DOCUMENTS CASES IN FLORIDA I CAN'T BLAME JACK SMITH FOR THE IN DICTMENT THAT'S LITERALLY HIS JOB BUT THIS IS NOT HIS JOB THIS IS NOW POLITICALE AND THIS IS PRETTY OBVIOUSLY COMING FROM A BIDING DO J THAT AGAIN IS POLITICALLY BYUS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THIS CURRENT TRUMP INDICTMENT WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME READING THE FACT THAT THE DOJ DID NOT SET UP A SPECIAL COUNCIL FOR THE HUNTER BID AN PROSECUTION THAT THE DO J APPEARS TO HAVE ATTEMPTAT A SWEETHARTUO HUNTER THAT THE DO J PRETTY OBVIOUSLY IS ATTEMPTING TO AVOID ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO HUNTER BYDAN'S FINANCES SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN DAD WHEN YOU READ THOSE TO INJUCT SUPOSITION ONE ANOTHER IT LOOKS LIKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS PROSECUTING YOU FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'SWHT IT' SMELLS LIKE AND BY THE WAY THIS WOULD OW MAKE IT THE SECOND TIME BECAUSE REMEMBER IT WAS UNDER BARAKOBOMA THAT THE F BI AND THE DO J WE'RE TARTDNING DONALTRUP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN STO BE THE SECOND TIME THAT DEMOCRATS IN CHARGE OF TE GOVERNMENT AND THE AUSPECIES OF LEGAL POWER WE'RE ESSENTIALLY TARGANING DONAL TRUMP THAT'S FRUMS ENTIRE CASE IT'S WHY HE'S CAN BE PROMOTED IN THE PRIMARIES BY THE WAY ITS ELIKE EVERYTIME GETS INDICTED EVERY REPUBLICAN RUSHES TO HIS DEFENSE AND THEY SHOULD ON THIS PARTICULAR INDICTMENT BECAUSE THE FEELING QUITE PROPERLY IS THIS IS A WEAPONIZATION OF LAWN FORCEMENT AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR POLITICAL REASONS   THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THIS IS AND IT'S IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE WILL GET TO THE ACTUAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND POLITICALLY SPEAKING FIRST WHEN YOU'RE UNNING A BUSINESS YOUR EMPLOYES CAN CREATE ALL SORTS OF

AVAILABLE AT DAILYWARE PLUS DOT COM RIGHT NOW OK HIM MEANWHILE SO THE MEDIA RESPONSE TO THESE INDICTMEN IS OBVIOUSLY MEMBER THE MEDIORIC STATIC ABOUT ALL THIS CAILING COLINS OF S ANAN SHE TRIED TO DENY THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECT TO ANY OF NONAL FRUM'S ACTIVITY HERE AND IT'S A VERY VERY WEET CASE THAT SHE'S MAKING BUT WHAT IS THAT MATTER SHE'S S ANAN THE PRESIDENT WAS TOLD GIVEN AD FIES THAT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE THE ULTIMATABILITY TO QUALIFY ELECTORS HE FOLLOWED THAT ADVICE NOW YOU MAY DISAGREE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY A CURRED OR NOT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE POLITICAL DEBAYD WE DON'T HAVE CRIMINAL TRY ALSO FOR THAT WE HAVE THE DISCUSSION I NATTEA THING ACTALYA CRRD AR NOT TI NOT UNDER THE FIRST TO  ATTER THAT THI THING O IN CRIPICIS NOT NOT AT ALL BE US UNDER THE FRESNA MAS ACTUALLY FRIED NO NOW THE FIRST TO MAN MAN ALOW  LET E SU YO TAT A IF HE SANG THAT THERE WAS FRID THE FIRST MEN IT DOESN'T ALLOW THAT PRESEN THE UNITED STATES TO GO AND CLAIM THERE AS FRAUD WHEN HE WAS TOLD THERE IS NOT FRID AND THEN TRIE TO  SIMPERT THE ELECTION BY OVER TURNING LANTEN AT A ELECTORS AND HE OR IS TAT AN RIGHT AYER AIN  ACTUAL INDITMENT O GA SO IN OTHER WORDS IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT YOU SAY THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOESN'T PROTECTED THAT'S A HELL OF A STANDARD FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT OBVIOUSLY UNTRUE AGAIN THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT FIRST AMENDMENT DEVELOPMENT IF IT TURNS OUT YOU CANNODVANCE A SPURIOUS LEGAL THEORY OR ADVANCE AN OPINION WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE WRONG OR EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE A THING THAT IS FALSE NOW NOW YO'RE NOT ALLOWED TO OUR TICULATE A THING THAT OTHERS HAVE TOLD YOU IS FALSE B YOU BELIEVE TO BE TRUE THAT THAT'S NOW THE THE STANDARD NO CATYELL WHO IS A LEGAL ANALYST AS WELL HE SAYS THIS ONE MOST SIGNIFICANT CASES IN AMERICAN HISTORY IT IS BUEN NOT FOR THE REASONS THAT'S A'VE LEFT BELIEVES IT IS WHY DO YOU THINK IT WAS SOAN COUR AND TO DO THAT FOR SO MANY PAGES INI AN DIT YES SO IT'S A SHOUTING AN TRO ANIMEN TY IT'S NOT JUST ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANDANDIMENS IT IS HE THE MOST SIGNIFICANCADIMEN AGAINST TONAL TRUMP IT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICA LEGAL CASE OF OUR LIFE TIMES IT IS ONE  IF NOT THE MOST SIGNIFICAN CASE AN YOU KNOT THI STATES HISTRY IT IS NOT FARE WITH TRE SCOT IT IS NOT FHERE WITH PRON FOR SUPPORT OF EDUCATION BECAUSE THIS COS TO THE ESENCHAL QUESTION OF WHOE ARE AS THE PEOPLE DO WE WAT SOME ONE THE PRESEDEN AT IN THIS WAY THAT IS SO INSANE IT'S UP THE  DREAD SCOT A CASE THAT LED TO THE CIVIL WAR AND DECLARED THAT BLACK PEOPLE WERE NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS AND COULD NOT BE AMERICAN CITIZENS IT'S UP THE BROWN FOR SIS BOARD WHICH ENDED SEGREGATION IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S UP THERE WITH THAT REALLY BECAUSE AND NOTE NOTICEIS LANGUAGE IT'S ARE WE GOING TO LET THE A MAN GET AWAY WITH THIS AS PRESIDENT GET AWAY WITH WITH WHAT EXACTLY HE'S NO LONGER THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES I NOTICE AND HE WAS IMPEAGED TWICE AND ALSO WHAT'S THE CRIME OUNOAVE TO DESCRIBE AT THE CRIME IN REFER TO BE LEGAL ONE MUST SIGNIFICANTCANT MAN TESE PEOPLE ARE WAY OUT OVER TEIR SKES HERE IS THE BIGGEST PROBEM OU KNO'T IN TERMS OF KIND OF LONG TERM INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES SO THERE'S THE SHORT TURN PROBLEM WHICH IS DON'T BRING SPURIOUS INVICNTMENTS THAT MAY LAND O PERSON IN JAIL FOR NOT COMMNTING THE CRIME BECAUS THE FACT IS THAT IF HE DOES ANY JAIL TIME AT ALL THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNIT FORMER PRESIDENT IS A SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD RIGHT NOW PRESUMABLY BY THE TIME THIS TRIAL ANDS WILL BE SEVENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD WHICH MEANS THAT IF HE ENS UP IN JAIL FOR TEN YEARS THEN THAT'S LIFE SENTENCE IS ES AN ELDERLY GENTLEMEN LEST WE FORGET BUT PUT THAT ASIDE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE AND YOU CAN SEE IT HAPPENING IS IT LET'S SAY THAT THIS INVITMENT GOES FORWARD BUT SAY THE JUDGE LHAT TO GO FORWARD WHET' SAY THE JURY CONVICTS IT WON'T GO TO SUPRIME COURT THE SUPRIMECORT WILL LOOK AT THESE CHARGES AND THE SPRIMECOURT IS VERY LIKELY TO SAY BY A FIVE FOR VOTE THAT THESE CHARGES OUR SPURIOUS AND T IS LIKELY TO OVERTURN THEM THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HAPPENED TO JACKSMITH'S CASE AGAINST FOR EXAMPLE THE FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR BOBIC DONAL TURN OUT THATW'S A SPURIOUS CASE GOT THROWN OUT IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE HIS CASE GET TORT NOW IMAGINE THE POLITICAL FALL OUT FROM A SUPREME COURT ON WHICH THREUNITED STATES  JUSTICES WERE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP THROWING OUT A CASE IN WHICH TONL TRUMP WAS CONVICTED OF CONSPIRING TO OVERTURN ELECTION CAN YOU AMAGIN WHT TH POLOTICAL FALL OUT'S GOING TO BE YOU WORRY ABOUT THE NCREDIBILITY OF AMERICAN'S INSTITUTIONS AND YOU PRETEND THAT YU YOU CARE ABOUT THAT IF YOU'RE JOBIDON THE ONLY REASON TO SEP THI SUP THIS TO UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF AMERICANS INSTITUTIONS EITHER WAY IT'S A CATCH TWENTY TO IF THEY CONVICT ON SPURIOUS CHARGES HAF THE COUNTRY BELIEVES THAT IT'S BULL CRAP AND INDICTES THE ENTIRE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT'S ALLREADY ON THE TABLE AND NOW IF ITGET'S OVERTURNE THE OTHER HALF ALSO BELIEVES THAT SO WELL DONE THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT CHARGE THINGS THAT DO N OT EXIST AS CRIMES AND WHILE THE POLITICAL FOLLOW OUT HAS BEEN IMMEDIATE PRESIDENT TRUMP IMMEDIATELY A WENT TO A LEVEL ELEVEN WICH YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THE COMPARISON IS CRAP A PRESIDENT FRUM PIT OUT A STATEMENT WHY DID THEY WAIT TO AND HALF YEARS TO BRING HEUE FATE CHARGES RIGHT IN TH MIDLE OF PRESIDENT TRUMPS WINNING CAMPAIGN FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHY WASIDT ANNOUNCE THE DAY AFTER BIG CROOKED JO BIDIN SCANDAL BROKE OUT FROM THE HALLS OF CONGRESS A ALL THAT'S FAR THE ANSWER IS ELECTION INTERFERENCE THE LAWLESSNESS OF THESE PERSECUTIONS OF PRESIDEENT TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS IS REMINISCENT OF NOTSY GERMANY IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE FORMER SOVIAT UNION AND OTHER AUTHORITARIAN DICTITORIAL REGIMES PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE LAW IN THE CONSTITUTION WITH ADVICE FROM MANY HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED ATTERNEIYS A SUP AN NOT NOT A HUGE FAN OF NOZY GERMANY  COMPARISONS BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THE NOTES DIDN'T ACTUALLY JUST TRUMP UP LEGAL CHARGES AT THEY LITERELLIGIOUS KILLED YOU OR PUT YOUIN A CONCENTRATION CAP AND SO DO THE FORMER SOVIET UNION IF THET DID TRUM PUBLIGAL TRARGES IT WAS LIKE A FULL ON SHOW TRAL IN WHICH YOU WERE FORCED TO CONVEST BECAUSE THEY BEAT IN THE BACKGROUND SO IS THE UNITED STATES NOTY GERMANYUR SOVI NO BUT ITS A BENAN A RE PUBLIC TYPE CRAP ABSOLUTELY AM MENTITH THIS INDICTMEN IS BENAN A RE PUBLICTYPE GARBAGE FORSHOR FORSHORE CEVEMA CARTHY THE HOSE SPEAKER HE PUT OUT IT S WE WHAT WE'VE RECENTLY LEARNED HUNDR RECEIVE MONEY FROM CHINA CONTRADICTING PRESIDENT BIDINS CLAIM PRESIENT BIDAN SPOKE WITH HUNTERS BUSINESS ASSOCIATES OVER TWENTY TIMES CONTRADICTING WHAT BIDIN PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED BIDINS GOJA TRIED TO SEECQUERTLY GIVE HUNTER BROAD IM UNITY AND ADMITTED THE SWEETHARTEALAS UN PRESIDENTED AND JUST YESTERDAY A NEW POLCHOD PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WITHOUT ADS OUT BDINS LEADING POLITICAL OPPONENT EVERY ONE IN AMERICA COULD SEE WHAT WAS GOINTO COME NEXT GOGA'S ATTEMPT TO DISTRACK FROM THE NEWS AN ATTACK THE FRUMNT RUNNR FOR THE RE PUBLICAN NOMINATION PRESIDENT TRUMP HOUSE RE PUBLICANS WILL CONTINUE TO UNCOVER THE TRUTH ABOUT BIDIN INK AND THE TWOTEERE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE OTHER RE PUBLICAN LAW MAKERS CAME OUT IN  DEFENSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT INCLUDED PEOPLE LIKE RONTO SANTIS WHO PUT OUT A STATEMENT POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS A DOUBLE STANDARD OF JUSTICE THAT DIDN'T STOP TRUMPS SOFPORS FROM ATTACKING ROUND TOSANTIS INSUFFICIENTLY SUBMISSIVE TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTIVE JIM JORDAN THE CHARE OF THE HUSE JUDICIARY COMINTES HAID WHEN YOU DRAIN THE SWAMP PRESIDENT FHOUR THE SWAMP FIGHTS BAK PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOTHING WRONG THERE'S SOME STAUNCH TRUMP TOF FENDERS TO CALLED FOR CUTING OFF MONEY FOR THESE SMITH INVESTIGATION OLD BE A LITTLE BUT LATE FOR THAT AT THIS POINT TIM SCOTT SUGGESTED HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE WEAPONISATION OF BIDINS T O J AND TOMENCE POWER USED AGAINST POLITICAL OPPONENTS  DEMOCRATS OF CORSE FOR SLEBRATORY SENTITMEN TJORITY LEADER TRUCSUMERS THAIT NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW INCLUDING DONAL TRUMP UNLES YOUR NAME IS  HUNTER BIDON OR HILLERY CLENT IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE TOTALY ABOVE THE WALL WE LOVE YOU YOU'RE THE BEST EVEN IF YOU'R LIKE A JEFFREY HUPSTIN MANDIN MINTUS  G ANANICE THIS INDITEMENTS THIS INDICTEMENT MUST NOW PLAY OUT THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE POLITICAL OR IDEA LOGICAL NTERFERENCE WE ENCOURAGE MISTER TRUMPS SOPPORTS IND PRITICS ALIKES LET DIS CASE PROCEED PEACEFULLY IN CORT O NOW THER FOR PEACEFUL QUART PROCEEDINGS A IS THAT IS NAT CUE MEAN NUM FORGET ALL OF TWENTY TWENTY GET THE RAILROADING OF PEOPLE LIKE AT DERIK SHOVAN NOTHENOT NOW THEY NOW THE LEGAL PROCESS IS TOTALLYAFFAIR AND ABOVE BOARD MEUN AL RESUTEF TO LEAB A TERRIBLE HUMAN SHE POSTED A SIMILAR ACCOUNT TO X WHICH JUS WITTER SAN COT TRUMPMUSE BE HELDIC COUNTABLE FOR CONSPIRING TO OVERTURN ELECTION AND IN CITING A VIOLENT FASHESTINSTRECTION I GIVING AWAY THE QUIET PART RIGHT THERE THAT I HE WASN'T CHARGED WITH INTITEMENT HEU AYHAVE NOTICED WHICH I NATURAL CRI AGAIN I POINT THAT OUT THE ENTIRONSIPEMENS FOUNCITEMENT THEY DIDN'T CHARGE HIM WITH INCITEMENT SO THERE IS THAT EH SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL IMPACT DON THE ELECTION WELL THERE'S A PETTY OBVIOUS IMPACT WHICH IS THAT IF TRUMP IS THE NOMINY THE ENTIRE ELECTION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HIS LEGAL TROUBLES THE ENTIRE ELECTION BECAUSE LISTIN TO THIS CALAN HEH HEREIS THE CALENDER FROM HERE ON OUT TOMORROW HE HAS A JANUARY SIXTH D C QUART APPEARANCE THE FIRST GEOPE OBATE HAPPENS AUGUST TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY THREE OCTOBER SECOND THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION CIVIL SUIT BEGINS JANURY FIFTEENTH THE EGING CAROL CIVIL DEFIMATION SUIT BEGINS JANUARY TWENTY NINTH THE PYRAMID SCHEME CLASS ACTION SUIT BEGINS MARCH TWENTY FIFTH THE HUSH MONEY SUIT BROUGHT BY THE MANHATTAN D EH BEGINS THAT'S MARSH TWENTY FIFTH MAY TWENTIETH THE CLASS FIED DOCUMENTS TRIAL BEGINS AND NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS PARTICULAR TRIALISCAN TO BEGIN I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S CAN BE SOMEWHERE IN THAT TIME ONE SO THE ENTIRE NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BE TAKEN UP BY DONALTRUM'S TRIALS HE'S GOING TO BE FOCUST ON IT LIKE A LAZERBIM AND THAT'S GOIN TO BE THE STRATEGY THE STRATEGY FOR JOBIDON IS GOING TO BE JUST CROWD OUT ALL OTHER MEDIO COVERE ALL OF IT THAT'S GON BE TH STRATEGY AND TRUMPS CAN MUSING ALLHIS MONEY ON HIS LEGAL OFFENCE HE ALREADY HAS REA Y'S ARDY TAPPED INTO ALL OF THE ELECTION FUNDS IN ORD TO PAY HIS LEGAL BILLS SO TAT HAS TWO PARTICULARLY STRONG RAMIFICATIONS FOR GENERAL ELECTION RAVICATION UMBER ONE IF THE ENTIRE ELECTIONSABOUT TRUMPS LEGAL PROBINCE VERY DIVICAL FRHIM TO WIN VERY VERY DIFFICULT TBECAUSE AGAIN EVERYBODY'S CAN BE FOCUST IN ON THE PROBINCE OF TRUM THE'RENOT CAN BE FOCAST IN ON THE PROBINS WITHTHE CURRNT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO'S BOTH CRRUPT AND TERRIBLE AT HIS JOP PROB NUMBER TWO IS IF TO TRUMP USES EVERY DOLLAR THAT IS COMING IN TO FIGHT ALL OF THESE SPURIOUS LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST HIM IU KNOR THAT MONEY ISN'T GOING IT'S NOT GOING TO BALLOT HARVESTING IT'S NOT GOING TOWARD THE KNOCK  NOTKING ON DOORS CAMPAIGN IS NOT GOING TO THE ON THE GROUND THINGS YOU NEED TO WIN A TIGHT ELECTION THAT'S ALL PART OF THE STRATEGY HERE SO THE THE FACT IS THE ALL THE STUFF DOES HAMSTRING DONAL TRUMPET IN GENERAL ELECTION IN PRETTY INCREDIBLE AND DRAMATIC WAYS OBVIOUSLY I AND TOM THOSE ARE CHALLENGES THAR TN BE HARD FOR TRUM  FORGET ABOUT ALL THE OTHER CANDIS FORGET ABOUTL THE E PUBLICAN PRIMARY CANDITS JUST ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL HE'S OURE SERIOUS OBSTACLES FROM NOW I UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONAL APPEAL FOR REPUBLICANS OF GIVE HIM THE CHANCE HE HES HES ONLY CHANCES WE HAVE TO GIVE IT TO HIM WE HAVE TO HEET WE HAVE TO LET HIM RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY BECAUSE THAT WAY HE CAN PARDON HIMSELF IN THE FEDERAL CASEAS OR IF HE WINS THAN HE HAS POWERS THAT HE WOULDN'T NORMALLY HAVE ALSO WEH WE NEED TO SEE THE CONCLUSION OF THIS MOVI WHERE TRUMP TAKES REVENGE OR LEAS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TAKE REVENGE I GAINST THE GOGE THAT HAS BEEN PLAYING HIM I GET I GET THE EMOTIONAL PEEL I FEEL IT MYSELF I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND IT ALSO WHO IS THE MOST LIKELY TO WIN BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY YOU ACTUALLY WIN AND DEFEAT THE JO BIDON POLITICAL MACHINE AND THE GEOGE RUN BY TROBIDON IS TO MAKE HIM NOT THE PRESIDENT ANY MORE AND THE ONLYWAY TO MAKE HIM NOT THE PRESIDENT ANY MORE IS TO REPLACE HIM WITHTHE REPUBLICAN AND THE THE WET E R PLACE WITHTHE REPUBLICAN IS TO RUN SOMEBODY WHO PRESUMABLY IS NOT GOING TO BE HAMPERED FOR THE NEXT YEAR BY MASSIVE LEGAL ISSUES SPENDING EVERY DOLLAR ON HIS LEGAL DEFENDS AND SPENDING NO TIME ACTUALLY CAMPAIGNING BECAUSE HE'S TOO BUSY DOING DEPOS DEPOSITIONS THESE ARE REAL ON THE GROUND CONCERNS N THAT IS NOT EXCUSING ANY OF THE ATTACKS ON TONAL TRUMP IT ISN'T ITS STO PRACTICAL REAL LIFE OF PRASAL OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION ON THE GROUND NOW DESPITE ALL OFTHOSE OUN THE GROUND CONCERNS THE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE GENERAL IN THE PRIMARY THERE'S NO QUESTIONS DANATIC COLPSTRUM THERE JUS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT GOOD EVIDENCE OF THIS IS A MIHT PANCE HIS RESPONS TO MIGHT PENSE THE FORMEVICE PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY WAS THE GUY WHO HAD TH SERTIFY THE ELECTION WHICH HE HAD TO LEGALLY DO OR CAVE THERE WIS NO ACTUALLEGEL ARGUMENT THAY COULD OVERTURN THE ELECTION THAT VICE PRESIDENT CANSENLY THROW ABOUT STATES CERTIFIED ELECTOROVOTES IF YOU THNK THAT'S THE CASE WENTIL COMNALL HERRISTUS IT IF TRUMPLINS THE ELECTION AND THEN TEA FEEL ABOUT IT THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE CONSTITUTION WORKS BUT MIGT PENCE PUT OUT A STATEMENT SANG UA TODAY'S INDITEMENT SERVES ENIENT AS AN IMPORTANT REMINDER ANYONE WHO PUTS HIMSELF OVER THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD NEVER E PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES HOWHAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE GOVERMENT'S CASE AFTER A VIEWING TH INDITEMENT THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS ENTITLE TO THE PESUMPTION OF INNOCENCS BUT WITH THIS S INDICTMENT HIS CANDIDACE HE MEANS MORE TALK ABYU JANUARY SIXTH AND MORE DISTRACTIONS IAS AMERICANTS HIS CANDIDACE HE MEANS LESSITENTION PAI TO JOBIDONS DISASTROUS ECONOMIC POLICIES AFFLICTING MILLIONS A CROSS THE UNITED STATES AND TO THE PATTERN OF CORRUPTION WITH HUNTER OUR COUNTRY'S MORE IM PORTAN THAN ONE MAN OUR CONSTITUTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY ONE MAN'S CAREER ON JANUARY SIX FORM PRESIDENT TOTRUMP DEMANDTAT I CHOOSE BETWEEN HIM AN THE CONSTITUTION I CHOSE THE CONSTITUTION ANA ALWAYS WELL O KASO THE BLOW BACK TO PENCE A STATEMENT HAS BEEN EXTRORDINARY AND I THINK FOR SOME GOOD REASON AND SOM BATTERIES SO HE IS SAYING TWO THINGS AND THEY ARE DISTINCT THINGS THING NUMBER ONE IS HE IS SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMPS ACTIVITIES LEADING UP TO JANUARY SIXTHOR GREGUS AND HAT HE SHOULDN'T BE THE NOMINE TBECAUSE SOMEBODY WHO DISPLAYS THAT SORT OF JUDGMENT SHOULD NOT BE THE NOMINY I HAVE A LOT OF GRIMOTE THAT SENTIMENT I THINK THAT TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR BETWEEN THE ELECTION AND JANUARY SIXT WAS IN FACTO GREGUS I THINK THAT THE PRESSUR HE PUT ON MY PRENTS PENCE TO TAKE UN CONSTUTIONAL ACTION WAS A GREGIOUS AND SPERIUS I THING ALL OF THOSE THINGS ALSO THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE TO DAY ETCAUS THE SECOND THING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SAID IS THE THN HE SHOULDHAVE SAD I DIDT WHICH IS STILL THIS INDICTEMENT IS OBVIOUSLY PUT UP JOB AS ALWAYS TWO THINGS COM METR AT ONCES IT 'RE NO HOW OFTEN I CAN SAY THIS DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR BETWEEN THE ELECTION IN JANUARY STICTES WAS UNPALATABLE IT WAS WRONG HE WAS SAYING THINGS THAT WERE NOT TRUE HE WAS LYING TWO PEOPLE ABOUT THOSE THINGS WHETHER HE BELIEVE THAT HE WAS LYING OR OTHER HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT IF THAT HE WASN'T HE WAS UASE MING ALLIGATIONS THAT WERE NOT EVEN ELEGED BY IS O WOYERS AND QORT HE WAS HE WAS ADVANCING A LEGAL THEORY ABSOLUTE IT'S AN INSANE LEGAL THEORY THE VICE PRESIDENT OF TE UNITED STATES IS THE SINGULAR POWER TO OVERTURN ELECTORAL RESULTS THAR ARE CERTIFIED BY THE STATES TAT'SUGJUST IT'S A NOTTY THEORY KAY ALL OF THAT CAN BE TRUE AND ALSO NOT A CRIME ALSO NOT A CRIME AND RIGHT NOW THE ISSUE IS WHETHER THINGS TAT ARE NOT CRIMES SHOULD BE CHARGED AS CRIMES NOT WHETHER DONAL TRUMPS BEHAVIOR DURING THE ELECTION WAS GOOD DOWN TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR DURING YOEULECTION WAS GOOD HAS BEN LITIGATED AND RELITIGATED ONE MILLION TIMES IN THE COR O PUBLIC OPINION IS LITGATED IN IMPEACHMENT WAS LITIGATED IN ELECTIONS THAT IT TOOK PLACE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE T WAS LITIGATED IN THE MITERNALLECTIONS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT WILL BE LITOGATED AGAIN PRESEMBLYAN TWHENTY TWENTY FOUR OF TRONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINATE BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION THE QUESTION OF TODAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN INDICTMENT COME DOWN IS DOES THE DO J HAVE THE POWER TO CHARGE PEOPLE WITH NON CRIMES AND THAT IS A MUCH BROADER ISSUE THAN DONAL TRUMPS ACTIVITIES ON JANUARY SIX NAS THE THING THAT MIG PENCE IS MISSING AND THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE SHALLACKING HIM TO DAY I CAN MEANWHILE THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF JUSTICE THAT HAD BECOME QUITE APPARENTS TO EVERYBODY CONTINUES THE THE MEDIA CONTINUED TO JUSTUDIOUSLY AVOID ANY IMPLICATION THAT HUNTER BIDNIN JOBIDON HAD SOME SORT OF A CORRUPT BARGAN GOING ON WHICH THEY PRETTY OBVIOUSLY DID HEROSE AN ENS DAIN ABASH TRYING TO DEFEND HUNTER AND JOBIDON'S ACTIVITIES DESPITE THE FACT T WE NOW HAVE OPEN TESTIMONY FROM DEVON ARCHER TO CONGRESS SUGGESTING THAT JOBIDON WAS ON TWENTY PHONE CALLS WITH HUNTER BIDONS BUSIESS PARTNERS THAT THAT HUNTER AND JOE OBVIOUS AND JOE OBVIOUSLY KNEW BOUT THE BUSINESSES WHEN WE KNOW ALL THESE THINGS BUT HEUROSE AN EN STAN ABASH TRYING TO YE WAVE HER HAND AWAY AT IT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE THE PRESIDENT WAS IN PALLED AND HUNTER BIDENS FISINES DEALING NOW BUT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WASHINGTON AND WE ALL UNDERSTAND A THAT A LOT OF THEES A RELATIONSHIPS OPERATE IN THE GRAY AREAS INTENTIONALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A SOMEBODY WHOIS EITHER RELATED TO A AA FAMOUS PERSON OR POWERFUL PERSON OR USE TO WORK FOR  A POWERFUL PERSON YOU WANT YOUR CLIENTS TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN GET THE ON THOM YEY HE'S OBERING THE GRAY AR EAS THE GRAY NOBEGGY IT'S THE GRAY AREAS MEANWHILE YOU HAVE MORNING JOE ONE OF THEIR HOSTS JOHNATHAN LWAWYER BASICALLY TROTTING OUT WHAT WHATS CAN BE TE FINAL FORM OF THE ARGUMENT WHICH IS ALL THIS IS JUST BECAUSE JOBIN I SUCH ANYSKY IS HEMEIN HE FINAL FORM OF THE ARGUMENT ITS CAN TO GO FROM HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE HUNTER'S BUSINESS DEALINGS AND HUNTER DID NOTHING WONG AND NEVER TOK TRINY'S MONEY TO SURE HUNTER DID SOMETHING WRONG TOOK TRINY'S MONEY BUT HE HE WASN'T INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS TO WELL HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS AND KNO WHAT WAS GOING ON ON A GENERAL LEVEL BUT HE'S AN AMAZING FATHER AND THAT'S WHERE JOHNATHAN LYERS IS GOING O RIGHT FOR IT HERE ON THEMISS AN BESAK AS FAR AS HUNTER BIDIN GOES THERE'S NO DOUBT HAVING KNOW IT'S PRETTY CLEAR EVEN THOSE CLOSE DIBIDING FAMILY SUGGEST THE SONE OF HIS BEHAVIOR IS PRETTY UNSEEMLY BUT DOESN'T MAKE IT INLEGAL AND IT ALSO MEANS WE DON'T KNOW THE ROLE AT ALL THEN VICE PRESIDENT BIDON MAY HAVE PLAYED AND IT SEEMS LIKE NO HI HAVEN'T PROVED THAT HE HAD ANT DY I THAT THE HAVENTPROVE THAT HE PROFITED FROM THIS AT ALL YET MAYBE HE IS GUILTY OF TURNING A BLIND EYE TO SOME OF HIS SONS A BEHAVIOR WE SHOULD PUT THIS IN CONTECT THIS IS A TIME WHEN BOBI IN THE PRESENCE OTHER SON WAS ILL OF THEN DYING AND THEN AND THAN PASSED AWAY A SO PERHAPS HE WAS WHO NOT IS ATTENTIVE TO WHAT HE SHOULD AVE BEEN HERE THE CARTIRKS ES THAT A THIS OS O THA TA A SORT OF VERY TROA N  TET TIME FOR THE BI TAILWY AN  WE KNOW O IMPORTANT FAMILY YES A TO THE PRESENTER E OE JOE BEN PN FO ON O ONO TIN  BEANY TIME BU TURLY A MON MY TAA PROBABLY ANSERUS MOLL HE LOVES HIS FAMILY WHICH IS WHY HE'S A CORRUPT ELDERLY GENS TAKING CASH FROM HIS CRACK SON HIS CRACK SNORTING SON WHO SHLIPS PROSTITUTES ON THE REGULAR HAS HE LOVES HIS FAMILY GUEYES THAT'S COM BE VO I I DO LOVE JONATHAN LAMIR'S ARGUMENT RIGHT THEIRE WHICHES UNSEEMLY DOESN'T MEAN LEGAL MEANWHILE OVER HERE DONAL TRUMP DOES 'NON SEEM THAT IS SERTAINLY ILLEGAL CAN YOU IN THEKRI'M KNO BUT IT'S VERY UNSEEMLY WHICH MEANS IT'S HE LEGAL THE

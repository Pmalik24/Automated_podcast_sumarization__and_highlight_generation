THE NEUESS ND THEY HAD A GOOD REASON TO THINK THEY WOULD BE WELCOME THERE JESSACAN MOYSASS'S BRAND OF ACTIVISM IY WAS CHAMPION BY REPUBLICANS INCLUDING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOR ITS DEFIANCE OF A LEFT WING AUTOCRAT THEY WERE CALLED FREEDOM FIGHTERS WE STANND WITH YOU REPUBLICAN SENATOR SAID AN STATEMENTS AND TWEETS AN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TEAD CRUWS GAVE A WHOLE SPEECH ABOUT YOUA SUPPORT FOR

YOU FOR YOUR COURAG AND REMEMBER TRUTH HAS POW THAT' SUPPORT IT'S PART OF WHAT MADE THEIR ASYLUM CASE SEEMED WINNABLE BECAUSE IT FELL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF POLITICAL PERSECUTION IT WAS ONE SLIVER OF THE ASYLUM SYSTEM LEFT INTACT AFTER YEARS OF DISMANTLING IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS GETTING ASYLUMUM US HAS BECOME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE ASYLUM SEEKERS WERE BEING TURNED AWAY AT THE BORDER TOLD NOP WERE CLOSED CASES ARE INCREDIBLY HARD TO WIN EVEN WHEN THEY DO GET TO THE COURTS BUT THE TRUMPADMINISTRATION DID LEAVE AT LEAST ONE WINDOW CRACT ONE OF THE FEW CATEGORIES OF ASYLUM SEEKERS THAT IT PROPORTED TO ACCEPT PEOPLE WHO WERE THREATENED TORTURED JAILED FOR THEIR POLITICS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEIR POLITICS OVERLAPPED WITH US INTEREST PEOPLE LIKE MOISESS AN JESSICA   MOISESS AND JESSICA WHERE A PERFECT ASYLUM CASE FOR ANOTHER REASON THEIR PERSECUTION WAS DOCUMENTED AND IT WAS PUBLIC AS ACKEDOTIS THEY HAD BECOME FAMOUS THEIR PROTESS HAD BEN TELIVISE THEY'D HELD NATIONALLY BROADCAST PRESS CONFERENCES PEOPLE RECOGNIZED THEM IN THE STREETS ALL THE TIME EVEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD TWEETED ABOUT SPECIFIC CONFRONTATIONS THEY HAD HAD WITH THE PARAMILITARY AT ANY OTHER TIME AND RECENT USS HISTORY THEY WOULD LIKELY HAVE BEEN ADMITTED BUT INSTEAD THEIRE IN HIDIN I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHY I'VE BEEN COVERING EMIGRATION FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THIS TIMY FELT LIKE THE LAST CHAPTER AND THE DISINTEGRATION OF ASYLUM SO I CALLED MOISESS AN JESSICA AND THE ATTIC TO HEAR ABOUT THEIR JOURNEY FROM START TO FINISH TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENT IN LATE TWENTY NINETEEN THEY STARTED TO GET READY MOISESS

HE COULD GATHER VIDIOS OF THEIR PROTESS AND PRESS CONFERENCEES REPORTS FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT STATEMENTS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS MOISESS ALSO RODE AFIVE PAGE DECLARATION A LONG ESSAY ENUMERATING EVERY THREAT EVERY BEATING HE'D RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT HE INCLUDED THE NAMES OF HIS TORTURERS HE READ ON LINE THAT THE DETAILS COULD HELP HIS FAMILY'S ASYLUM CASE SO HE WAS AE SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE THE BACKPACK TOOK ON A KIND OF SACRED ROLE FOR THEM IT WAS THERE PROOF THAT THEY WERE DESERVING OF THE SLIVER OF ASYLUM THAT REMAINED

ROLL BECAUSE NORMALLY THEY'RE RESTRICTED TO THEIR KEYBOARD AN THEIR PHONE EH YOU KNOW I LOVE THAT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THAT SPECTRUM IF EVER YOURE FEELING TENSE TRESS JETLAG ANGRY UM YEUKW I CAN THINK ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS WEAR LIKE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR EGOES INCHECK THEY WANT TO BE RIGHT UM YOU KNOW THAT BREAK UPS NEGOTIATIONS IT IS UST NOT A SE RLY ROMANTIC BREAK UP THAT COULD INCLUDE THAT BUT ALSO PROFESSIONALL BREAK UPS IN THE THE DISSOLUTION OF A OF A CONTRACT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT DO YOU EVER HAVE TO CHECK YOURSELF LIKE OOK ET  I NEEDS IT I MAN I IMAGINE BEING CALM IS BETTER THAN NOT BEING CALM FOR MOST UPMOST ALL THINGS IM I D YOU HAVE A PROCESS OF DOING THAT YOU SEEM LY A PRETTY STEADY I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU I DO OVER ALL AN PRETTY STEADY IM WELL WATHE LATE NIGHT F M DE G VOICE THAT  I'M NOT SURE THAT I COIN THE PHRASE BUT CONTOFAMOUS FOR TO CALM YOU DOWN ALSO CALMS TO ME DOWN SO IF I GET BEN OUT OF SHAPE EM I WILL AN A CONVERSATION COULS HEATED I'LL SWITCH INTO THAT VOICE WITH THE INTENTION OF OF CALMING YOU DOWN COS TAT YOU NOT'S THE THAT'S THE HOSTERE EXOTIATOR'S VOICE BUT IT'LL CALM ME DOWN TOO LIK INTENTIONALLY GOING TO THAT VOICE TAMPS DOWN THE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS WHICH I'M CONVINCED MAKE ME DUMMER IN THE MOMENT INTERFERE WITH MY CAPACITY O PROCESS INFORMATION GOT REASONS FOR THAT LAYMAN'S REASONS NO SCIENTIFIC ACADEMILIC RERIGOROUS STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN ANY JOURNALS WHILE AFTER YOU'RE DONE UP AN I TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL PERHAPS BE ASTONISHING TO YOU AS TO WHY THERE'S REAL NUROU SCIENCE BEHIND THAT LATE NI F M D G VOICE HAVING AN IMPACKTD ON OTHER PEOPLE'S PRANCS BUT NOT YET  AND I'LL DO THAT AS IT CALMS ME DOWN NOW IF I CAN IF I CAN MAKE THE SHIFT THE HARD PART IS TO SHIFT INTO A POSIT OVE MIND SET IF I CAN MAKE THAT SHIFT BUT I CAN ONLY MAKE IT FROM A CALM VOICE I ALSO THINK IT'S THE EMOTIONS ARE KIND OF A ROCK PAPER SCISSORS SEQUENCE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO FROM SADNESS TO ELATION DIRECTLY A SAD IM PRESS DOUN I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO UM GETTING ANGRY TO PULL YOU OUT A SADNESS AND I THINK IF YOU'RE ANGRY YOU'VE GOT O GO TO CALM NEXT AND SO BUT IF I CAN GET OUT OF ANGER AND GO TO CALM THEN I CAN SAY SOMETHING O MYSELF LIKE THE REALITY IS THIS IS A LUXURY PROB OR I WAS IN A NEGOTIATION WITH A COUNTERPART THAT I KNEW WAS DECEIVING LYING TO ME AND I EMEMBER SAYING TO MYSELF AND I'M LUCKY TO BE IN HIS NEGOTIATION I MEAN I WOULDN'T THEY WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO HOSTLE ME IF WE WEREN'T REALLY GOOD IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A PRODUCT THAT WAS PHENOMENAL I WOULDN'T BE TARGETED IT AT ALL SO I'M ACTUALLY LUCKY TO BE IN THIS CONVERSATION SO IF I CAN MAKE THAT NEXT SHIFT HE MOSTILY THAN I'M GOOD THE HARD PART IS MAKE ANOTIOUS I MEANING TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I LEARNED RECENTLY ABOUT SOUND AND EMOTION IM I'M RESEARCHING AN EPISODE ON MUSIC IN THE BRAIN FASCINATING TOPIC LEAVING OUT THERE'S A LOT KNOWN AND THE AUDITORY SYSTEM HAS THIS PROPERTY WHERE OF COURSE THEIR NURANS NERECELLS THAT RESPONDED DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES OF SOUND LOW LOW FREQUENCY NO DEEPER TONES AND I FREQUENCY SQUEALS AND THAT SORT OF THOTHAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD JUST LIKE WE HAVE NURANS THAT RESPONDED DIFFERENT DIFFERENT COLORS ARE DIFFERENT A YOU KNOW ANGLES OF LIGHT IN IN THE ROOM BUT WHAT I LEARNED AND I CONFIRMED WITH A GOOD FRIEND OF MY STA AUDITORY NER SCIENTIST AND AND NER SURGEONS NAMES AT ECHANG HE WAS A GUESSED ON THE SPOTCAST PREVIOUSLY IS THAT LOW FREQUENCY SOUNDS OF THE SORT THAT YOUR VOICE IS THAT LATE NIGHT F M D J VOICE OR RESPONDED TO IN THE BRAIN BY NURANS NO SURPRISE THERE BUT THE FREQUENCY AT THOSE NURANS FIRE IS ALSO LOW FREQUENCY IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU SPEAK IN YOUR LOW VOICE THE OTHER PERSONS BRAIN HEAR'S THAT AND STARTS FIRING IN A LOW FREQUENCY O IN OTHER WORDS ITTIN TRAINS TO YOUR VOICE NOT JUST THE TIMING BUT IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY PLAYING AN EMOTIONAL PIANO DOWN IN THE LOW KEYS OF THERE OF THEIR MIND NOW WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE HIGH FREQUENCIES THE NURANS CAN'T FOLLOW THAT HIGH FREQUENCY SO THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT LOW FREQUENCY SOUND THAT ACTUALLY CHANGES THE EMOTIONAL TONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT HEAR THAT LOW FREQUENCY SOUND THIS IS WILD RIGHT IING  OF COURSE THE CONTENT OF THE WORDS MATTERS TOO BUT ANY WY THERE'S THAT THERE 'S REAL NORROW SCIENCE TO SUPPORT  THE VOICE THAT YOU ERE ENDOWED WITH HIM THAT YOU A THAT YOU EMPLOYED FOR YOUR WORK WELL THEN AND THEN ALSO THE POINT THEN TO IS IT'S NOT THE OTHER SIDES NOT MAKING A CHOICE IT'S AN INVOLUNTARY REACTION THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING ONE CAN OVERRIDE EXCEPT BY PERHAPS PLUGGING THEIR EARS  RIGHT NEITHEIR HEARING THAT THERE THEIR MIND IS GETTING SHIFTED TOWARD A STATE OF LOW FREQUENCY OSCILLATION WHICH IS ONE OF MORE CALM SO THEN YES SO THAT'S A REAL THING AND AND WERRE YOU TO HAVE A  HIGH SQUEAKY CHIPMUNK'S VOICE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE NEGOTIATOR YOU AT ALL THE WHO KNOWS MAYBE THERE BE ANOTHER TACTIC THERE I MAYNIT I THINK BACK TO THE A WHAT I GUSS IT WAS DURING ONE OF THE GULF WORK CAMPAIGNS WHETHER THEY WEREN'T THEY TRYING TO AM SQUEEZE OUT A SADOM AND SOME OF A HIS PEOPLE BY PLAYING LIKE MILLY VANILLY AT HIGH VOLUME FOR HOURS ANDHOURS IS THAT TACTIC ACTUALLY USED M SO THAT THAT WAS THAT WAS A PANAMA WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO GET NORYEGAIS ITAM I'M ONLY A FEW A'M ONLY A FEW COUNTRIES O AND I I AN'T NOTION OR GET THE FAND  IWAYS TELL MOU BEFORE AND THE WACKY YET AFASTENING USELESS INFORMATION ROUND TARISM STUFF LIKE THAT I TRIED THAT T AT PANAMA AND AND FOR WHATEVER THE MILL ITARY GUISE THEY WERE PLAN MUSIC T AND SOUNDS AND THEN ALSO AMONG H MANY STUPID THINGS THAT THE IF TE I DID A WAKO AND LATE AT NIGHT THEY TRIED THAT IN THE WACO COMPOUND TO AND IT WAS JUST THERE WAS ONE OF THINGS THAT THE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATORS WERE ADIMATELY AGAINST ADIMATELY AGAINST BUT THEY GOT OVERULED A BY AUNTSING COMMAND AMONG THE MANY STUPID THINGS OVER DONE AT WAKO THAT WAS ALSO DON AT WAKE WE STUPIDIS CONPRODUCTIVE HOSTERS NEGOTIATORS WERE ALWAYS AGAINST IT SO FOR THOSE YOU DON'T REMEMBER WAKCO WAKO WAS A BRANCH DIVIDIANS A DAVID CORASS RIRIT YETHERE WAS A A NEFLIXERIES TIT WAS OUT ABOUT A RECENTLY THAT'S FAIR ABOUT THA HOW HOU WENT THOW YES SAD ENDING HE EVENTUALLY SET THE THE BUILDING A BLAZE HEILED HIMSELF IN EVERYBODY ELSE AND A PEOPLE INSIDE SET THE BUILDING ON FIR INCLUDING A LOT OF CHILDREN PARI INCLUDING SOME CHILDREN AM THERESM A EPYAGENS THAT DOVE NOT GOTTEN OVER THAT LET YOU TALK ABOUT SOME DIFFERENT TYPES OF NEGOTIATIONS A OFTENTIMES I THINK BECAUSE YOURE A FORMER IF BEYIND NEGOTIATOR IT TE TERRIS TASK FORCE THIS KIND OF THING A BTENDEFOCUS ON THE NEGATIVE NEGOTIATIONS IHT GET THE HOSTAGES AWAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT STUFF A BREAK UPS BUSINESS DEALS THAT HAVE GONE WRONG A PEOPLE LYING CHEATING WHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE BENEVOLENT LET'S SAY THAT TWO PEOPLE WANT TO A COME TO IT A TRUE WIND WIND AROUND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY EACH SEE TO BE THEIR BEST INTEREST IN WHAT'S A FRIENDSHIP TWO FRIENDS TAKEN A TRIP TOGETHER ACATION WHO'SE GAN TO PAY FOR WHAT WHOSE GAN TO PAY UP FRONT PEOPLE IN TO PAY EACH OTHER BACK AOR A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP TWO PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING YOU KNOW FUSING FINANCES TO SOME EXTENT OR MOVING IN TOGETHER WHAT SORTS OF QUESTIONS SHOULD PEOPLE BE ASKING THEMSELVES PRIOR TO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS IN PARTICULAR IS IT VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT GOING INTO A NEGOTIATION OR I CAN RECALL MANY TIMES WHEN I'VE GONE INTO LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWING I WANTED A CERTAIN SET OF FEELINGS OR OUTCOMES BUT NOT BEING EXTREMELY SPECIFIC ABOUT YOU KNOW I WANT THIS SALARY I WANT TO LIVE IN YOU KNOW IN A WEST FACING HOUSE ON THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION YOU KNOW AN EXPLORATION UM CAN OF POTENTIALS A MI THINK CAN ALSO TAKE THE FORMER NEGOTIATION SO BUT HOW'D HOW SHOULD PEOPLE THINK ABOUT APPROACHING BENEVOLENT NEGOTIATIONS LIKE WERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING TRAGIC HAPPENING IF IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH IT MIGHT HURT IT MIGHT BE A BIT HIGH FRICTION BUT STALK ABOUT HOW TO GET TO A WIN WIN YET WELL IS AS COUPLE INTERESTING THINGS ARE FIRST OF ALL IN O THE PHRASE WIN WIN UM A BECAUSE WIN WIN IS JUST GREAT COLLIBORATION I MEAN POINT OF FACT IT SHOULD BE WIN WIN WHICH MIGHT ONLY BE EMOTIONAL WIN WIN NOW THE PHRASEOLOGY WIN WIN I KNOW THAT IF SOMEONES OPENS A NEGOTIATION WITH ME AND THEY SAY RIGHT UP THE BAD LOOK I WANT TED TO WIN WEN DO WITH YOU THAT CORRELATES EXTREMELY HIGHLY WITH SOME ONE IS TRYING TO PICK MY POCKET SO I IF YOU USE THAT PHRASE IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES I READY KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM YOU TRYIN TO GET ME TO DRAWP MY GUARDS YOU WEN I LOSE SO AND IS CAME UP ON AN INSTRGRAUND POST I PUT UP RECENT WYN WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WAT WATCH OUT FOR H PERSON SAYS WEN WEN NOT DIDN'T SAY WIN WIN IS BAD I SAID WATCH OUT FOR A PERSON AT SES IT ALSO YOU GOT TO BE CAUTIOUS IF IF YOU LIKE SOME F THE WIN WIN MIND SET AND PEOPLE SET THEMSELVES UP TO JUST GET SLAUGHTERED BY THE PERSON IS EXPRESSING A DESIRE FOR WEN WEN AND LOOK IN A PICK THEIR POCKET  IF I FEEL WIN WHEN MY HEART YOU GO LET'S DO WEN WEND DEAL IF IN A WATCH 'M LIKE ALL CAY WHAT DO YOUT WANT AND THEN I'V FIND MYSELF GIVEN AWAY THE STORE SO THERE'S A LOT BEHIND THE WEN WEN PHRASEOLOGY THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF IN POINT TOF FACT BOTH SIDES SHOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE OUTCOME AND ISN'T THAT THE DEFINITION OF WEN WEN WHELL KINOSSORTER BUT IT'S HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT IT MORE THAN REALLY WHAT THEY GOT SO IN A BENEVOLENT NEGOTIATION AMONG FRIENDS WHERE WE GOING TO GO TO EAT WHERE WE GOING ON VACATION WHAT RUDER WE GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE REALLY JUST WAINT TO BE HERD OUT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHICH OPERATIONALLY SEEMS TO BE UNUNDERSTAND HOW IT'S GON TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD AND HOW WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR SOMEBODY TO FEEL HEARD OUT WELL I'M ING TO START OUT BY TELLING YOU DESCRIBING TO YOU NOT TELLING YOU BUT DESCRIBING TO YOU WHAT MY BEST GUESS IS ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY CALIBRATING ME ACTUALLY FINDING OUT WHERE YOUR POSITION IS AND THE ONLY WAY I CAN FIND OUT WHERE YOUR POSITION ACTUALLY IS I'M IN I'M IN A INCREASE YOU TELLING ME IF I START TAKING A GUESS AT AT FIRST CAUSE YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY RIGHT AWAY OU HE IMMEDIATELY GOING TO TELL ME EITHER 'M RIGHT OR 'M WRONG YOU'RE GIN CORRECT ME CORRECTION IS A IS A SATISFYING THING TO DO AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE CANDID WITH ME IF YOU'RE CORRECTIN ME THAN IF I'M ASKING YOU SO I'L AND YOU'R FEEL GOOD ABOUT CORRECT OF ME SO IT'S GOING IT THERE'S ALL THESE GREAT EMOTIONAL LUBRICRANCE TO ME GETTING YOU TO CORRECT ME SO UNESTO OUT BY SAYING LIKE HIS HIS IS WHAT I THINK YOU'RE THINKIN HIS I THINK YOU'RE APPROACHINGNESS IS WHAT I THINK YOU'RE WANTIN OUT OF THIS OUT OF THIS NOT WHAT YOU SHOULD BE BUT WHAT YOU PROBABLY ARE BASED ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND THAT'S GOING EXCELERAT THE CONVERSATION EXPENANTIALLY LIKE IT'S RIDICULOUS HOW MUCH FASTER THINGS ARE GOING TO GO AND THEN IT BECOMES BOTH AN ININFORMATION GATHERING AND REPOOR BUILDING PROCIS SIMULTANEOUSLY INSTEAD OF SEPARATELY WHICH IS WHAT MAKES US APPROACH FAST OR EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS MORE INDIRECT SO IF WE'RE GETTIN READ ITS SAY YOU ANIT GET TO THING A CART TRIP T CA A TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM HERE AND I MUST SAY AR SO MY GUESS IS YOU WANT TO TAKE THE MOST DIRECT RUTE BECAUSE YOU HATE WAST ING TIME AND YOU PROBLGAM SAY TO ME NOT  I WANT TO GO UP THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY BECAUSE TIS BEAUTIFUL STRETCH E A COUNTRY LIKE I REALIZE IT'S GOING TO BE WASTE OF TIME IF WE GO UP THE PACIFIC COAST CAUSE WE GET A JUMP OFF IT AT SOME POINT BUT I REALLY WANT TO SEE THE SCENERY YOU WOULD HAVE I'VE TAKEN A GUESS OR WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU CON COME BACK REAL QUICK AND CORRECT ME AND AND MAYBE I'M THINKIN TIME ON THE TRIP BUT I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS TO ROLL UP THE COAST AND SO WHEN YOU THROW THAT I'LL BE LIKE OUR YEH IT IS A BEAUTIFUL IDE AND WE MIGHT NOT GET INTO THE SHOT  LIKE WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO YET I KNOW NOW NOW THAT WE'RE HAVENG A CONVERSATION I'D RATHER RUN UP THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY BEFORE WE BEFORE WE GO INLAND AND MAKE THE TRIP AND AND THAT'S HOW WE GET TO A WE COLLABORATE FOR BETTERA BETTER OUT COME MAY BE A BETTER IDEA THAN WHAT I HAD MINE IN THE FIRST PLACE I LOVE THAT BECAUSE WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED THIS HYPOTHESIS TESTING YES IT'S THE WAY SCIENTIST OR TRAIN YU MAY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT DAY TEACH US IN SIENCE NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT TO START WITH A QUESTION LIKE YOU KNOW HOW DOES IT HOW DOES THE BRAIN DEVELOPED FOR SOMETHING AND THEN YOU SAY A HYPOTHESIS AND YOU TEST HYPOTHESES AND THYE FIGURE OUT THER RIGHT AR WRONG AND THAT TAKES YOU THROUGH A SET OF DECISION TREES AND YOU EVENTUALLY GET AT WHAT YOU HOPE AS SOME CORT TRUTH A AND AN HEALTHLY OTHERS ARRIVE THERE AS WELL AN YOU GET AT CONSENSIS SO I LOVE THE IDEA OF HYPOTHESIS TESTING IN FACT WHEN YOU SAID I TAKE THE MOST DIRECTR OUT FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW I INLOS ANGELIST TO I SAN FRANCISCO I'M I LIKE TO TAKE ONE O ONE NOT THE FIVE THE FIVE IS FASTER S I MEANLY THINK BUT I LIKE ONE O ONE FIRST WHILE THEIR COUPLE REALLY GREAT TALKO AND HAMBURGER SPOTS ALONG THE WAY THAT I SAT OP AN MY BULL DOG AN  ALSO GET TO SEE AT THE COAST AND IT MAKES THOSE EXTRA TWO HOURS COMPLETELY WORTH IT AND SO YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT AND I IN THAT WORKING THROUGH THE DECISION TREE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN U PRESUMING THAT THE THE HYPOTHESIS IS RIGHT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU BE EQUALLY O K WITH THE HYPOTHESIS BEING WRONG BECAUSE REALLY WHAT YOUR TRYING DO IS JUST LEARN AND IN LEARNING SET UP YA COLLABORATION A NO COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HYPOTHESIS D WHEN WHEN MY SON BRAND WAS INVOLVED ON A COMPANIES ON IS ATON HIS OWN NOW BUT HES ALWAYS SAY HYPOTHESIS TEST YOUR HYPOTHESIS HE ALWAYS USE AT TERM DAND EVEN NOW LIK CA WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT AND YOU JUS SAID YOU KNEW SOME HOT DOG AND HAMBURGER PLACES AR BUT A CALLI COW I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT YEND WHY YET I WANT TO CHECK THOSE PLACES OUT SO AS HOW YOU DISCOVER NEW STUFF IN A CONVERSATION LOF IT SO  AND ALSO I SIRE PEOPLE ARE NOTING TO NOT SAY THE WORDS WIND WIND WHEN APPROACHING INDOF NEGOTIATION WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT THOSE LITTLE UM CATCH PHRASES THAT THAT SIGNAL LACK OF AUTHENTICITY OR TRUSTWORTHINESS BECAUSE YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT SOMEBODY UMIGHT COME TO YOU AND SAY YOU KNOW HACRISTS LIKE LETS A I LET'S DO SOME COLLABORATIVE THING FOR  SOCIAL MEDEA FOR POTCAST AND UM THIS CAN BE A WIND WIN FOR BOTH OF US NOW I KNOW IT I NEVER SAY THAT WITH YOU BUT YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT SOMEBODY REALLY MEANS THAT  BUT FOR YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IT'S A FLAG THAT IM THEIRE TRYN TO PULL ONE OVER IT'S IT'S A IT CORRELATES REALLY STRONGLY WITH THE PEOPLE THAT A DEAFNIKE TRYNO CARTYOUR THROAT AND I'VE HAD I'E HAD IM ADMIT THAT TO ME CANDIDLY MAS I LIKE I'LL BE IM I'VE EXPERIENCED IT THI GIVE S MEBODY THROWS WIN WENT OUT EARLY TO ME I'LL SAY RIGHT I THINK I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING BUT LET ME EXPLORE IT AND E'LL A YEAH YOU KNOW THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU THAT'S ANOTHER TOP AND WOGAN  PUT YOU IN A ROOM WITH ALL THESE BILLIONERS AND IT'S GOIN TO BE ALL THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU IF YOU JUST COME IN AND SPEAK AND YOU KNONT WE DON'T HAVE A BUDGET OH I'VE GOTEN THAT ONE BEFORE THE THE FAMOUS THAT THE FAMOUS A THE WORLD OWERE JUST WORK OUT IN YOUR FAVOR ES MASI CAUSE IT'S GET A WORK OUT IN MY FAVOR EXACTLY RIGHT H'T I'VE BEEN OTHE RECEIVING END OF THOSE OFFERS MANY A TIME A FASCINATING  CONVERSELY WHAT SORTS OF OPEN ERSE AM DO YOU THINK ESTABLISHED THE BEST REPORTER AND A YOU'N A BENEVOLENT DISCOVERY OF A TOPIC BUT WHEN I'M SAING CORLATES REAL STRONGLY WITH PEOPLE I WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH IF IF THEY FIG IT OUT SOMETHING THAT THEY KNOWS VALUABLE FOR ME AND THEY'VE JUST DONE IT AND THY'VE JUST OFFERED IT LIKE RODT OFF THE BAT NO STRINGS ATTACHED IF THEY FOUND A WAY TO DROP SOMETHING ON ME THAT'S VALUABLE THEY DIDN'T APPROACH ME WITH THEIR HAND OUT THEY APPROACH ME WITH SOME SORT OF GENEROSITY I A AV FRONT OF MINE JOE POLISH RUNS THIS I'LL FID CALL GENIUS NIHT WORK JOE BELIET SAS LIFE GIFTS TO THE GIVER AM I JUG THAT A BUNCH OF FAVORS FOR ME BEFORE I EVER JOINED AND HE WAS TRYING TO HELP ME OUT AND GET MY BOOKS SOLD AND HE ASKED ME TO COME IN AND SPEAK AND HE'D HE'D DONE UP HE'D EMPHASIZE MY BOOK ON HIS POT CASS AND A DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS AND I AND I I FINDLY PAY TE FEE TO JOIN CAUSE HE'D DONE SO MUCH FOR ME LIKE THIS NOT MUCH JOE COULD ASKD ME FORE RIGHT NOW CAUSE HE'S DONE SO MUCH FOR ME THAT HE GETS A BLANKET PRETTY MUCH YEST RIGHT AWAY WHAT H WHAT WOULD WANT WHUT HIN CAUSE HE' JUST GENEROUS AND THE GENEROSITY APPROACH UNIVERSALLY I'M SEEING A LOT OF REALLY SUCCESSFUL PEOP PLE TO LEAD BY GENEROSITY AND SO IF YOU START OUT THAT YOU KNOW IFIF YOU GIVE ME FIVE STORO E BOOK ON AMZON NO STRINGS ATTACHED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT GOES A LONG LONG WAY TO SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO ESTABLISH A LONG TUM RELATIONSHIP O COLLABORATION WHEN I FIRST OPENED MY LABORATORY IN A TWO THOUSAND LEVEN I HAD A TECHNICIAN AT THE TIME WHO 'D BEEN A TECHNICIAM FOM A LOT O YEARS AND THERE'S THIS CULTURE IN SCIENCE OF PEOPLE BORROWING THINGS FROM LABORATORIES AND NOT GIVING THEM BACK OR BREAKING THEM THESE CAN BE LITTLE THINGS LIKE A YOU KNOW SMALL INSTRUMENT OR A A FORSTEPS UM BUT YOU KNOW AS A STUDENT OR POSTLICKE THESE OF THE THINS THAT YOU COVE IT LIKE A REALLY NICE PARAFORE SEPS IS LIKE A GREAT THING YOU KNOW YOU DROP EM ONCE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT GOOD ANY MORE BY THE WAY IT'S LIKE THER THER O ANT TO TREAT THEM WITH RESPECTS SURGICAL TOOLS HAVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT THAT ANTHESE ARE VERY FINE INSTRUMENTS AND PEOPLE USED TO COME BY OUR LAB ALL THE TIME AND BORROW STUFF FROM US AND HE'D ALWAYS LEND IT OUT E WHAT ARE YOU DOING BUT ANY TIME I WENT TO GO BORROW SOMETHING HE'D SAY DO NOT BORROW ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE THEN WE'RE GOING TO OWE THEM RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY SEVERYAND ALS THAT YOU'RE RUNNING UP OR BUDGET GIVEN AWAY THESE INSTRUMENTS THAT COME BACK WITH THE FORSTEPS DENTINE AVEN HE SAID JUST TRUST ME THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT AND I DON'T RECALL EVER COULDN'T QUO CASHING IN ON ANY OF THAT BUT HE WAS EXACTLY RIGHT WHEN I EVENTUALLY DECIDE TO MOVE INSTITUTIONS WE'D GIVEN AWAY SO MUCH AND WE'D ASKED FOR SO VERY LITTLE MAY BE NOTHING THAT YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU LEAVE A PLACE TYPICALLY THERE CAN BE A LOTTLE BAD BLOOD AND ALL WE' GOT WAS SORRY TO SEE YOU GO CONHAD IT BEEN ME I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A KIND OF A IN EXCHANGE OF O WE ASKE FOR THINGS WE GIVE THINGS YOU KNOW ITSTO HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD I GOR UP A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE YOU'D BORROW EGGS OR MILK FROM THE NEIGHBOR REMEMBER THOSE DAYS AH O NO IF PEOPLE DO THAT ANY LONGER A BUT I THINK IT FALLS WELL INTO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN YOU JUST DO THINGS FOR PEOPLE I'M OUT OF GOODNESS THEN YOU KNOW SURE YOU SORT OF HAVE A A HISTORY WHERE YOU COULD RETURN TO THAT THEY OWE YOU BUT THERE'S ALL SO JA SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT JUST DOING THINGS OUT OF GOODNESS AND ALSO NOT ASKING FOR SO MUCH EM AN EXPECTING PEOPLE TO PROVIDE THAT SO I I LOVE THAT AND I ACTUALLY

NEGOTIATIONS OR THER TYPES OND NEGOTIATIONS WHERE THEYRE IT'S THE POTENTIAL FOR A TRULY BAD OUTCOME RANK EM I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ASKED TIS BEFORE BUT SOME OF OURE LISTENERS ER GOING TO BE LEARNING ABOUT YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME DO YOU RECALL OF THE MANY NEGOTIATIONS THAT YOU DID WHILE IN THE EFBII ANY ONE PARTICULAR NEGOTIATION THAT FELT LIKE IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT THIS IS REALLY COTOSTROPHIC AND WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHARE THAT WITH US WELL UM I LEARNE YOU KNOW TO TRY TO TEACH US EARLY ON THAT NOT EVERYTHING'S GOING TO WORK OUT AND THE SECOND NEGOTIATION I HADN'T PHILIPPINES A FIRST ONE AYOUNG MAN O JEFF SHELLING WAS GRABBED BY TERRACE GROUP A ABUSIV AND A ENIT UP WALKIN AWAY CAUSE WE WE STALE THE BAG ISES LONG ENOUGH THAT WE JUST YOU KNOW SOME TIMES IF YOU CAN SLOW IT DOWN YOUL WAIT FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO FALL OUT OF SKY AND IT WILL AND THAT ID ENOUGH HAPPENING IN THAT CASE IND A BAD GUY IN'S O CALLIN THE NEGOTIATOR THAT I COACHED ON A PHONE AFTER WAS OVER THE BASICALLY TELL EM THAT THEY STILL HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP IT WAS NOT A WHY IS A BAG I CALLD THE NEGOTIATE A RESPONSIBLE FRIEND LOSING EVERYTHING AND SAY ANLY GOOD A GOOD JOB WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPEN SO WE ROLL INTO A CASE A AND I HADN'T HAD ANYTHING GO BAD AT THAT POINT OF TIME E VANIC CASE AT BURNHAM SOME BARREL CASE A BY DIFFERENT FASHION OF THE TERRACE GROUP THIRTEEN MONTHS LATER IN'S UP IN AM TO THE THREE REMAINING HOSTAGES SHOT KILLED BY FRIENDLY FIRE ON ALONG THE WAY A HOSTAGES HAV BEEN EXECUTED AMERICAN HAD BEEN EXECUTED EARLY ON AND IT WAS IT WAS A TRAIN RACK AND LOTS OF PEOPLE GOT KILLED ALL ON AWAY AND JUST REALLY RIDICULOUS BAD THINGS HAPPENING AND THAT THAT WAS BAD ALL THE WAY THROUG A SO WE LEARNT O LEARNED A LIE FROM IT A WENT BACK AND CHECKED EVERYTHING WE DID AND WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG THAT WE FELT BASED ON A STRATAGY DIDN'T DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING AND THAT WAS WHY IN IT UP GOIN A CLABORATING WITH THE GUIS AT HARVARD BECAUSE MY REACTION WAS IF THIS IF WE DID EVERYTHING WE KNOW HOW TO DO AND IT WASN'T ENOUGH THAT MEANS WERE NOT SMART ENOUGH WE GOT TO GET BETTER AND SO THAT CASE TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT THE DYNAMACTUR REALLY HAPPENED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOWT WHETHER OT PEOPLEER REALLY ON YOUR SIDE THE ASE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE A THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE THE EVERYBODY WANTED TO GET THEIR POUNTOF FLESH OUT OF THE OTHER OUT OF THE OTHER SIDE I MEAN JUST EVERYTHING BAD THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE EARLIN ON WHEN GARMUSTERBERO A WAS MURDERED BY THE EBBUSIF IT WAS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY IN T E PHILIPPINES AND THE BAGUSE HAD A HISTORY OF KILLING PEOPLE ON NATIONAL HOLIDAYS AND WE WEREN'T FUN OF PHILIPPINES AND WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THAT DAY WAS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY AND WE SHOWED UP AT A PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN MANILLA AND IT WAS CLOSED NOW WE GOT IN ONT TI GOT IT ON GOING HOSTAGE CASE WITH BAD GUISE THREATENING TO KILL HOSTAGES AND WE SHOW UP AT THE GATES AND THE GATES WARE CLOSED AND WEN LIKE PUT THE HOUSE GOING ON HE IT WAS THE NATIONAL HOLIDAY AND NOBODY'S WORKING TODAY AN MI FIRST OF ALL NOBODY TOLD US THAT SECONDLY I DON'T THINK THE BAGGUISE REALLY CARE THAT IT'S THE NATIONAL HOLIDAY AND NOBODY'S WORKIN OUR NEGOTIATORS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND WE GOT WE GOT WE GOT A GUY THERE THAT THAM  THE PREVIOUS NEGOTIATOR WE WORKED WITH PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE WAS NOT THAT HAPPY THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE HIM UNDER COMPLETE CONTROL SO THEY GIVE US A GUI THAT WE'LL NOT TELL US ANYTHING UNTIL AFTER HE'S TOLD THEM SO HES SAD N'T CONVERSATION WITH THE BAD GUISE AND WE'RE ACTUALLY HEREIN ABOUT HIM SECOND HAND HE DIDN'T SHOW UP THAT DAY AND THEN AND OF COURSE THAT DAY THE BAGIES ANNOUNCE ARE GOING TO KILL A KILL A HOSTAGE AND GIBIT IS A GIFT TO COUNTRY THE PHILIPPINES CAUSE IT'S A HOLIDAY AND THEN GO ALL BY THE WAY THEY LIKE DOING THIS ON HOLIDAYS AND SO AN AND GERMISTERBERRY ANT OF GETT HIS HEAD CUT OFF WITH THE BECAUSE OF ALL THEF WARRING FACTIONS ON OUR SIDE OF THE TABLE NOT TELLING EACH OTHER WHAT THELSE GOING ON SO I HAD ASSUMED AT THAT POINT OF TIME THAT PEOPLE TELL US THE STUFF WE NEED TO KNOW WE DIDN NEED TO ASK AND AND AFTER THAT I GOT LIKE LOOK THERE AIN'T NOTHING HERE THAT I DON'T NEED TO KNOW I DON'T YOR FITOLIDIES COMING OUP IN YOU SOOM I KNOW YOU GOT TO TELL US SO REALLY LEARNED A LOT ABOUT COLLABORATION ON OUR SIDE OF THE TABLE AND ALSO THE LACK OF COLLABORATION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE JUSCAUSE WER MEST DOESN'T MEAN THEY GOT THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND THE BAD GUISE DIDN'T HAVE THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND ULTIMATELY THE HOSTAGES ONE OF THE REASON SOMMON IDN'T COME OUT BECAUSE INTERNALLY THEY THEY HAD DOUBLE CROSS EACH OTHER SO LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHAT REALLY FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN NATURED DYNAMICS ARN TEAMS AND YOUR TEM HAS NOT GOT UTSACT TOGETHER AND THE OTHER THEAM DOES NOT EITHER SO WHAT CAN YOU DO IS A COMMUNICATOR TO MAKE UP FOR THAT REALLY LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THAT IN THAT CASE I HAD CASES SUBSEQUENT TO THAT INVOLVED ING ALCITO WHEN AL CITA WAS KILLING PEOPLE ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT WE SAW THOSE COMMIN AND WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD DO TO KEEP THE TRAIN FROM SMASHING INTO US YOU SEE A TRAIN COMING DOWN A TRACKS YOU KNOW IT'S COMING DOWN THE TRACKS AND YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN TO DE RAIL ITTING SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T I'VE HEARD IT SAID THAT WHEN PEOPLE TAKE SOMEBODY CAPTIVE THAT THEY EITHER WANT THEIR MONEY THEIR BODY OR THEIR LIFE OR SOME COMMONATION OF THOSE YATS THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE THREE AND IT'S VERY TRUE AND AS THE NEGOTIATOR TRYING TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGE IS IT IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY EARLY ON WHICH OF THOSE THREE OR WHICH ALL OF THOSE THREE UM THE'REAFTER LIKE HOUE SERIOUS THEY ARE ARE THEY WILLING TO ACTUALLY KILL THE HOSTAGE ARE THEY UM YOU KNOW WILL THEY GO FOR ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY ABOVE AXS NUMBER OF DOLLARS IROUND JETS FIGURE OUT THEIR THRESHOLD RIGHT I MEAN ECAUSE THE PERSON IS ON THE OTHER SIDE IS GAMBLING RIGHT THEIR GAMBLING THERE THE FREEDOM THEIR GAMBLING THERE U REPUTATION WITH WHOEVER THEIR REPUTATION MATTERS TO UM IS IT IMPORTANT TO GET INTO THE MIND SET OF THE PERSONEER NEGOTIATING WITH QUICKLY UM USING THE HYPOTHESIS A GENERATING METHOD YOU HAM AND IF SO A COULD YOU GIVE A AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT PLAYED OUT IN IN YOUR PREVIOUS WORK AT THE AM THE INDICATORS ARE REALLY THERE I MEAN ONCE YOU SORT OF A LUSEYOUR ILLUSIONS ABOUT HOW YOU THINGS IW YOU THINK THINGS SHOULD PLAY OUT THE A PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR ARE GENERALLY PRETTY QUICK I AIN'T CLEAR AND JUST CAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE PATTERNS LIKE WITHOUKITA WE RECOGNIZE THA PATTERNS AND KNOWIN WHAT THEY ARE DOES A MEAN YOU CAN CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE AN ALCIT AND TWO THOUSAND FORESE TIME FRIM WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT KELLING PEOPLE ON DEDLINE AND WE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT SO THAT THERE THERE BECOMES A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR AND IT'S USUALLY SPECIFICITY IN WHAT THEY SAY AND THIS IT THIS IS ALL THIS IS ALL HUMAN NATURE LIKE IF IF IF YOU'RE IN A BUSINESS NEGOTIATION AND THEY SAY YOU KNOW W'LLCAN DO SOME HORRIBLE HERE YOU KNOW WER GAN A WALK OUT N THAT'S FAIRLY NON SPECIFIC AND IF THEY SAY LOOK IF WE DON'T GET THI BY THIS PESPECIFIC DEADLINE IF WE DON'T GET THESE SPECIFIC THINGS MET BY THI SPECIFIC TIME THAT'S PRETTY SPECIFIC THAT ITS SPECIFICITY YOU'E LOOKING FOR IT I LEARN TO LOOK FOR IT AND GEDNAPPING NEGOTIATION N WE'RE WORKING A CASE AGAIN IN THE PHILIPPINS AND A BAG IS SAY YOU KNOW FI IF WE DON'T GET A RANSOM FOR THE SUN SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOY AT THE TIME IS KIDNAPPED YOU KNOW YOU TELL HIS FATHEY'S GOING TO LOSIN EGG AND AT'S THE YOU YOU YOUPHAMISM FOR LOSING A CHILD AND EARLY ON WHEN THAT THREATENING THROUGH ON OUR SIDE TO THE TABLE BUT HE'S LIKE ALL MY GOT THEY GING TO KILL IM AND OFIS IS REALLY BAD WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE FAMILY CAN PAY THE RANSOM I'M LIKE NONIN O NOW IT DIDN'T HEY DIDN'T SAY WHEN IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THEY DIDN'T SAY HOW WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THEY DIDN'T SAY WHO WAS GOING TO DO IT YOU KNOW THE BASIC SPECIPICITY OF WHO WUT WEN IN WEAR LIKE THEY LEFT THEMSELVES AN OUT HERE A VERY CLEAR OUT AND WE NEVER SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO IT WE NEVER SAID WHEN IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WE NEVER SAID WOODS CHILD YOU KNOW WHAT THEY JUST TRYNG TO SCARE I THROWN OUT SOMETHING VAGU I SAI WE GT WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO PLAY WITH THIS WE GOT IT WE GOT A PUSHIS ALL THEWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS AND TO THE END NOW LATER ON IN THAT CASE WHEN THE FAMILY TRIED TO DELIVER A RANSOM AND IT WAS SCREWED UP BY GOD KNOWS WHO THE BAG IS CAME UP BACK ON A PHONE AND THEY SAID IF WE DON'T GET PAID TO MORR YOUR SON DIES AND I SAT RIGHT NOW THAT'S SPECIFIC AND HE'S GUI SOUND LIKE THEY MEAN IT AND SO WE'RE GOINGTO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THI TINGOES DOWN TO MORROW OR THAT'S THE END O THIS KID ND AT THAT POINT OF TIME WE ALLOWED THE FAMILY WE WERE INT A POSITION TO ALLOW OR THISALLOW WE WERE IN A POSITION THE AWL FOR THOUGHTS AND OUR THOUGHTS WER THEY MEAN IT NOW AND YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING NOW OR LIKELY SOMETHING BADS GOING TO HAPPEN AND NOW THAT THER TIS SERIOUS CAUSE YOU ALWAYS GOT A WORRY ABOUT WWE'S TO REFER TO HIS A DOUBLE DEP TDO THEY TAKE THE MONEY AND THEN'S AND THEY COME BACK AND SAY NOW THAT WAS A DOWN PAYMENT THAT WASN'T THE RANT THAT WAS JUST THE DOWN PAYMENT YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET DOUBLE DIPP IF YOU LET THE FAMILY PAY AND YOU GOT TO GIVE YOUR HONEST OPINION IS TO WHETEN AT THE N AT THE HOAGE GO IF TO PAYN NOW AND OUR OUR THOUGHTS WERE YOU PANTEMAR YOU SONCS COMING OUT ANYTHIN THE DOUBLE DIP IS A SCARY THING TO HEAR ABOUT A AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL MEANING MORE MINOR LEVEL A PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET SHAKEN DOWN ON LINE YOU KNOW THAT THEY'R PASSWORD WILL GET TAKEN THEREAE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE WHO GO FOR THE CLICK ON THIS LANK YOU KNOW YOU GET A TAX MESSAGE YOU KNOW WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT YOUR ACCOUNT HAS YOU KNOW BEEN CHANGE VERIFY YOU CLICK ON THE LANK TAKES YOU SOME PLACE WHERE YOU PUT IN YOUR LOGGING IND PASSWORD AND BOOM IT'S GONE AND THEN THEY TRY AND SELL IT BACK TO YOU TYPICALLY THROUGH CRIPTICCURRENCY BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRACEABLE BY THE WAY THOSE THISE NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE A LOT OF FUN IF YOU' LET M I HAVE WELL I'M HOPING THAT OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS NOW IS GOING TO SAVE SOME PEOPLE A THE TROUBLE OF HAVING THEI'R THEY'RE ACCOUNTS HACT I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE WHOE HAVE THEIR ACCOUNTS HACT AND THESE ARE SOME SMART PEOPLE BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT I'VE ALSO OBSERVED THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE SOMEBODY GETS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY SAY YOU KNOW I'M JUST GOING TO GIN WHAT THEY WANT AND I I REMEMBER IN THIS ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE SAYING NO NOO DO NOT GIVE THEM THE MONEY BECAUSE THEN THE'RE JUST GOING TO SAY THEY WANT MORE THERE'S NOW THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY'RE GING TO GIVE YOU BACK WHAT YOU WANT RIGHTAN WHY WOULD THEY RIGHT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHY WOULD THEY THE MONEY FUNNELS IN UNLEC THEY JUST CAN PIVOT AND GO TO THE NEXT THING SO HOW DO YOU UM GAIN CONFIDENCE THAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE DOUBLE DIPPED OR NOT UM WELL FIRST OF ALL I GOT TO FIND OUT IF YOU KNOW ITHAN A POSITION TO CARRY OUT THE THREAD OR  THE'RE ANY SORT OF LEGEN POSITION BEGIN WITH YOU NOW FOR LACK OF A BETTER TARMENTS PROOF OF LIFE AND THEYRE LOT OF PEOPLE AR TO TRY TO SCAM YOU BUT THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCAM YOU SHE GOT TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW WO DO DO SOME CONFIRMATION DO THEY DDO THEY HAVE ACCESS O YOUR COUNT DO THEY DO THEY HAVE YOU DAT OF THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY DDO THEY HAVE IT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY JUST TRYING TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THAT POSITION OF AN  INFLUENCE ON YOU UM THEY'RE LOT OF A  LOT OF BAGUIES OUT THERE THAT ARE JUST ROLE AN A DIE STYLING FOR DOLLARS IF YOU WILL AND IF THEY DON'T SCAM YOU WHEN THEY HAVE NO LEVERE OHN YA THEY'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE THAT'LL GIVE IN SO THERE'S A BIT OF YOU DON'T AUTHENTICITY OR OR DARE THEY IN A POSITION TO DO IT AND UM THE SAME RULE APPLIES IN ANY NEGOTIATION UM THE OTHER SIDE IS GOING TO GIVE IN WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE GOTTEN EVERYTHING THEY CAN KIDNAPPERS I'D BE ASKED BY AN AMBASSADOR I ASKED BY ANIF BE I COMMANDER WHINS I'S GOING TO BE OVER WHEN THE BAD GUISES FEEL LIKE THEY'VE GOTTEN EVERYTHING THEY COULD NOT WHEN THEY DID BUT WHEN THEY FELT LIKE THEY DID SO OUR JOBS JUST MAKE HEM FEEL IT SOONER SO YOU KNOW HOW HOW HARD YOU MAKE IT INNOCENTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE EVERYBODY EVRBODY WANTS TO FEEL LIKE THEY DID E THEY GOT A GOOD DAYS PAY FOR A GOOD DAYS WORK SO IF YOU LET THEM FEEL LIKE THEIR IN CHARGE AND YOU MAKE A MORK BY ASKING EM INNOCENT HOW IN WHAT QUESTIONS WHICH ARE VERY HARD AND FATIGUING TO ANSWER THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOURE GING TO GET A SOLID OUTCOME WHERE YOU DON'T GET DOUBLE DEPTH AND THEYRE GONG TO BE HAPPY THAT IT'S OVER CAUSE THEY FELT LIKE THEY GOT EVERYTHING THEY COULD IT COULD BE A DATE COULD BE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT UM COULD BE ANYTHING THE OTHER SIDE IS GOING TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE OUTCOME WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE WORKED FOR IT AND  BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS JUST SELLIN YOUR CAR AND SOME YOU'VE  PUT A PRICE TAG ON YOUR CAR AND I GOI WALKS UP TOE INSISTS I'LL GIVE YOU FULL AMOUNT RIGHT NOW WHICH YOUR REACTION I SHOULD ASK FOR MORE I MAYBE I WON'T SELL MY CAR YOU KNOW EVERY HUMAN INTERACTION YOTHERSIDE WANTS TO FEEL LIKE THAT THEY EARNED WHAT THEY GOT AND SO THE IDEA OF EMPATHY IN HOSTES NEGOTIATION IS REALLY JUST TO MAKE HIM FEEL THAT SOONER CON TO COME BACK TO EMPATHY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BIG AND IMPORTANT TOPIC BUT I'VE HEARD IT SAID BEFORE THAT IF SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW MAYBE Y ALSO SOMEBODY YOU KNOW PLACES A REAL SENSE OF URGENCY ON YOU KNOW NEED THE MONEY NOW OR A I NEED TO OU DO SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY OR ELSE AM NOT A THREAT OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE BUT THAT ANY REQUEST FOR A EXPEDITING SOMETHING IS A RED FLAG Y THAT IT'S LIKELY TO BE A SCAM YOU KNOW VERY SELDOM DO YOU NEED TO CLICK ON THE LINK WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS RIGHT I MEAN HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE RIGHT THBUT WE BUT THAT'S ONE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE EXPLOITED YOU AM THAT SOME REQUEST COMES IN BY THONE OR BY YOU KNOW EMALE OR TAX TO HER MAYBE EVEN PERSON SOMEBODY SAYS YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW OR ELSE SOMETHING BAD AS CAN HAV CAPTURE PEOPLE'S SENSE OF URGENCE I GET THEM TO MAKE A MISTAKE AND THEN THERE THEY'RE LEFT REELING BECAUSE THAT REQUEST FOR SOMETHING RIGHT NOW OR ELSE I THINK HITS A FUNDAMENTAL NERVE IN US IU KNOW E WANT O HELP TO BE A RESCUER RIGHT SO M IS THAT A GOOD RULE OF THUMB FOR PEOPLE TO KEEP IN MIND IT DID NOT I THINK THAT'S YOUR GREAT RULE OF THUMB I MEAN I A FRIEND OF MINE A SOEBODY GOT O HOLD OF HIS FHONE NUMBER NOT THAT LONG AGO AND A I GI WAS GETTING TAC FROM HIS NUMBER SO LIKE LOOK MA I GOTSOME R PROMS LO ID I NEED SOME MONEY FROM YOU NOW WHS A FRIEND FRIEND'S NUMBER AND I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW IT ACTUALLY IF WHEN I FIRST THOUGHT I WAS REALLY BUSY AND I FELT BAD THAT I DIDN'T BACK THAT DHAY AND THEN I DIDN'T HEAR FROM EM AGAIN AN FATHA WE W ATEVER WAS YOU WORKED IT OUT SO COUPLE WEEKS LATER I GET THE TEXT AGAIN YOU GOT REAL PROMME GOT TO GET BACK TO ME RIGHT NOW SO I'M I'M I DECIDE  IF IT'S REALLY MY BUDDY I AM GOING TO HELP HIM RIGHT NOW I GOT TO MAKE CHURCH REALLY MY BUDDY AN I SAID AY MAN YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T RAISE THIS AT ALL LAST TIME I SAWIN IN VAGUS CAUSE I'D SEEN HIM IN VAGUS RECENTLY AND HE'S LIKE GA YOU KNOW I WAS BUSY I COULDN'T BRING IT UP AND SOMETHING LIKE OUR SO THERE'S NO DIRECT CONFIRMATION OF THE NILE WE HAD WE HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER VAGUS SO THEN I SHOOT BACK A IY LIKE AND MAN I GOT TO TAY SOMETHING THAT WAS SUCH A CRAZY NIGHT AND I STILL OWE YOU MONEY FROM THEM SO YOU KNOW THAT NIGHT WHEN WE'RE GAMBLING I I STILL OWE YOU MONEY I'M HAPPY TO HELP NOW IT WASN'T A CRAZY NIGHT IT WAS BREAKFAST AND I DIDN'T O MONEY AND HIS NEXT RESPONSE WAS LIKE YE I DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT YOU KNOW YOU CAN MAKE IT UP FROM TO ME WITH THIS SO MI GRIED COOL SE NOW I START MAKIN STUFF UP AND I SAID YOU KNOW AND WHEN WE WERE ITH THOSE STRIPPERS AND THAT DOG AND THE CLOWN AND THE PONY I'LL NEVER GGET OVER THAT AND SO NOW THE GUYS WOULD HE TALKIN ABOUT AND I SAID BY THE WAY AND THEN I STARTED THROWN IN SOME STUFF ABOUT HIS WIFE AND HIS MOTHER AND  GUY GOT INSULT THAND CALLD ME NAMES AND STOP TEXT TO ME AND THEN I THEN I SENT ALL THOSE TEX MESSAGES TO THE REAL GUY INCLUDING YOU KNOW WHAT I'D SAID ABOUT HIS MOTHER AND HE TACTED ME BACK HE'S GOT A GREAT SENSE OF HUMORIS AYS BY THE WAY MY MUM DOES THINK YOU'RE ATRACTIVE OH TET I BUT I STHOUGHT I STHARTED IT ALL BY JUST CHECKING THE SOURCE IF IT WAS MY FRIEND I WOULD A HELP THEM IMMEDIATELY AND I NEED TO THROW SOMETHING AT HIM THAT'S GOING TO CONFIRM THAT IT'S HIM AND THEN I'M THERE FOR HIM BUT I'M  ALSO GOING TO HAVE PUT A LITTLE BIT OF A CURVIN THERE THAT THAT IF HE DOESN'T CATCH I KNOW IT'S I KNOW IT'S THE TIN AND THEN I'M GOIN HALF FOND WEATHEN INCREDIBLE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE  HEAR THIS AN THEY MIGHT THINK OH YOU NOW THAT'S NEVER GOIN TO HAPPEN TO ME BUT IKE A SAID I AM KNOWN FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE THEY TAKE THE BAT OF CLICKING ON THE LINK AND THEN NOW THEY'RE GTTING THE SHAKE DOWN I'M ACTUALLY A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE SAID THAT HER PARENTS CALLED AT SOME POINT PARENTS PROBABLY IN THEIR LATE SEVENTYS NOW IM SOME ONE HAD CALLED THEIR HOUSE AND TOLD THEM THAT THEIR CHILD THIS WOMAN HAD BEEN UM KIDNAPPED RAND THAT THEY NEEDED TO SEND MONEY AND THAT IF THEY CALLED THE POLICE THEY'D KILL HER OR HARM HER AND SOMEWHAT SO THEY STARTED SENDING MONEY AND THEY WERE AFRAID TO CONTACT OR AND YOU CAN SEE LIKE WHAT A BIND A A LOVING PARENT WOULD BE IN RIGHT THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT TO GET THIS CHILD OF THEIRS HURT AND THEY OBVIOUSLY A WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES IN ORDER TO GET THE BACTRINE THAT AS TOTAL SCAMP BECAUSE EVENTUALLY THERE WAS COMMUNICATION THAT MADE REALIZED THAT THAT THEIR DAUGHTER WAS PERFECTLY OQUT AND EVER EVEN INTERACTED WITH KIDNAPPERS SHOSE KINDS OF SCAMPS HAPPEN PRETTY OFTEN I HATHET HAVEN'T A FRIEND ALSO YE SO THE SENSE OF URGENCY BUT SHOULD HAVE BEN THE FIRST FLAG THAT'S AT THAT'S A GREAT POINT YE ABSOLUTELY AND IT LOOK LOOK EVEN IF THEY'VE GOT YOU LOVED ONE THE SECONDARY ISSUE IS IF YOU DO WHAT THEY WANT ARE THEY GON A LOTHM GO WHICH IS ACTUALLY A LEGITIMATE QUESTION LIKE IF THEY REALLY ARE BADGUAGE ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED IN HOSSAGE NEGOTIATION THAT I APPLIT OF BUSINESS NEGOTIATION THERE'RE LEGENMATE QUESTION SO AS SO KET ASK OT YOU NOT BEING DISRESPECTFUL YOU'RE NOT PUSHIN BACK THERE'S THERE ARE FAIR IF YOU AN'T USY IF BOM FAIRLYGENIMATE QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IS BASICALLY YOU KNOW IF I COMPLY IS JUS GOING TO WORK OUT THE WAY THAT YOU'RE ARTICULATING IT ANYTHING THAT ADDS COMMUNICATION INTO IT WHICH GIVES YOU MORE INFORMATION TO FIND OUT WHAT THE OLD TIMAN I' COME LOOKS LIKE EVEN IN KIDNAPPINGS HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU PAY THE GON ALAUTUMGO THAT'S A LEGENEMATE QUESTION THERE ARE EXAMPLE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN YOU KOW GETTING YOUR INSTROGRAM ACCOUNT HACKED YOUR BANK ACCOUNT HACKE AND YOU GOD FORBID YOUR CHILD KIDNAPPE FOR INSTANCE A THERE'S A WHOLE PRACTICE WITHINTHE LEGAL PROFESSION OF PROBING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GIVE UP MONEY TO AVOID A LAW SUIT FOR INSTANCE THIS IS A I SHAE A LAWYER FRIEND OF MINE RECENTLY DESCRIBED THEIR JAW VERY WELL HE SAID IN HIS WORDS FIRST PERSON HE SAID I SCARE PEOPLE FOR MONEY THE OPERATYV WORD BEING SCARPY THAT'S BEEN AN ANCE BIONAC YET HE'S BEING VERY HONEST HE SCARCE PEOPLE FOR MONEYIS VERY GOOD AT IT AND A AND HEU UNDERSTANDS HOW OTHER PEOPLE SCARE PEOPLE FOR MONEY AND HE WORKS BOTH SIDES YOU KNOW A PLAINTIVE FOR DEFENSE TYPE SITUATIONS BUT NNOW IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT YOU A LOT OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS NOT OCAYE THA LAW SUIT SLID ACROSS THE TABLE IT'S THE OQUET HEARS WHAT THE LAWSUIT WOULD LOOK LIKE HERE E ALL THE STATUTES THAT POTENTIALLY WERE WERE VIOLATED AND THEN THERE'S A PROBE OF LIKE WHAT SOMEBODY'S FINANCES ARE AND WE KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'R WILLING TO PAY AND DO THEY HAVE LIABILITY INSURANCE TO THEY HAVE AN UMBRELLA POLICY ALL THE SORTS OF THING THATRE THATARE REALLY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN ILLEGAL SHAKE DOWN BUT IT'S YOU KNOW A PROBING AS TO WEATHER OR NOT YOU KNOW T THERE'S IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT FAGNOSING THE OTHER SENSIBILITY TO PAY YOUR NIGHT AND SO THAT HAPPENS REALLY OFTEN I CAN GIVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE WHERE A SOMEBODY HAD A INCIDENT AT A DOG PARK WHERE THEIR DOG A A LEGIDLY RAN INTO SOMEBODY MAY BE CHARGED AT SOMEBODY A DOG RT PEOPLE ARE STANDING AROUND AND THE PERSON MOVED AND AN AND APPARENTLY INJURED THEIR NEET BUT RATHER THAN SO THE OWNER OF THE DOG WHAT THEY TYPICALLY DO IS DELIVERER SOME SET OF DOCUMENTS THAT SAY YOU KNOW I WAS A INJURED YOUR DOG WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AM AND IF YOU DON'T SETTLE UP FOR AX NUMBER OF DOLLARS YOU CAN BE SUED FOR USUALLY AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT ATAND THEN THERE'S THIS QUESTION THAT THE THE LAWYERS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT LIKE IS IT PUFFERY RIGHT ARE THEY SAYING HAT OMENTO SO YOU FOR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AS THERE AIN'T BASIS FOR THAT AND GOOD LAWYERS WILL SAY THAT'S PUFFERY THERE THEY'RE TRYIN TO SCARE YOU WITH A BIG NUMBER BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE THAT NUMBER AGO O MY GOODNESS WHAT ARE THEY WANT YOU KNOW I LIKE I DON'T EVEN NOW IF THEY WERE INJURED IF THEY WERE THAT'S TERRIBLE I'D WANT THAT TAKING CARE OF IF MY DOGS RESPONSIBLE I WANT THAT TAKING CARE OF BUT WHAT IT WHAT A TEY NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE TO THIS GO WAY AND THAT HAPPENS MILLIONS OF TIMES A DAY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND A GOOD PORTION OF THOSE PROBABLY HAPPEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THERE'S A THAT'S GOND THE WAY THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS ARRANGED SO THAT THIS IS NOT SOMEBODY AM YOU KNOW IT COULD BE SOMEBODY MENITLAYING THE LAW COULD ALSO BE SOMEBODY WHO'S BEING ENTIRELY HONEST ABOUT THE'RE EXPERIENCE OF BEING INJURED BY SOMEBODY ELSE'S DOG SO UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS I MAN SOUNDSLAY THE SAME SET OF RULES APPLY YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW SERIOUS THEY ARE DO THEY HAVE A CASE SO TO SPEAK THUS THE WORK OF THE LAWYERS BUT IN TE CESSING HOW SERIOUS SOMEBODY IS YOU SAID SIT'S FAIR YOU CALLED AT THE EFF WORD I LIKE THAT I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT IT JUST ASK A FAIR QUESTION LIKE THAT HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU THINK YOU DESERVE OR A IS THAT WOULD NOAT BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A VERY DIRECT QUESTION A OR IS IT AM HOW LIKELY ARE YOU TO WALK AWAY IF WE DON'T GIVE YOU THE MONEY LIKE IT YOU KNOW IT SIR I BECAUSE I COULD IMAGINE THRE'S ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE WOULD BE DISHONEST ABOUT ABOUT ANSWERING THOSE QUESTION WELL TENTHEN I HOW MUCH MONEY YOU THINK YOU COULD DESERVE A YOU DESERVE IS IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTI IN NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THE ANSWER IS BUT HOW THEY ANSWER IT I YYOU GING TO GET HOW QUICKLY THEY FIRE BACK AND WHETHER NOT THEY STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT HOW AND WHAT QUESTIONS TYPICALLY OR BEST TO JUDGE THE OTHER SIDE TO REACTION ANDY ANSWER IS SECONDARY CAUS HOW OR WHAT QUESTION CAUSES WHAT WE WOULD REFER TO IS A DEEP THINKING SLOW THINKING DANNYCONOMAN BEHAVORLECONOMICS THINKING FASTAND SLOW SLOW THINKING IS IN DEPT THINKING YOU ASK HOW OR WHAT QUESTION MAKE THE OTHER SIDE THINK FIRST AND JUDGE THER REACTION TO HOW THEY THINK ABOUT IT AND DO THEY ACTUALLY DO THEY ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT IT WHOR DER THEY FIRE RIGHT BACK AT YOU THEY GIVE YOU A CLEARER PICTURE OF WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH WHERE THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO GO HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU THINK THAT YOU DESERVE IF THEY IMMEDIATELY OU TEN MILLION DOLLARS I SO TIS IS I GET A SHAPE DON ARTIST ON THE OTHER SIDE OR THEY SAY I IF THEY STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT AND THEY GIVE YOU A THOUGHTFUL ANSWER THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU ASKIN A QUESTION TO GET A TO DIG KNOWS HOW THEY RESPOND FIRST THE ANSWER IS SECOND AND SOMETIMES I IF IT'S A CUT THROT ON THE OTHER SIDE I'M AN TO START PAPRON EM WITH HOW AN WHAT QUESTIONS JUST TO WEAR AM OUT THAT'S PASSIVE AGRESTION IF I IF I GOT A CUT THRUGHOAT A GRESSORON THE OTHER SIDE I'M ANT TO DROP INTO PASSIVE OGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR TO SLOW EM DOWN AND WEAR AM OUT MONE OF MY HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION HEROES A GONNAME JOHNNY PIKO WAS JOHN TO MINICO PIKO NOT NOT JOHNNY LIKE JOHNY ROCKETS ITANIAN JOHNNY JOHN TO MENICO GOT ALL THE A WESTERN HOSTAGE IS OUT OF BAYROOT N MIDAGE WHAT A BOOK CALLED MAN WITHOUT A GUN I YUNEGOTIATED IN PERSON FACE TO FACE WITH HIS BULLA THE ONLY GANG THAT EVER DID THAT GOT EVERYBODY OUT AND IN HIS BOOK HE WROTE ONE OF THE GREAT SECRETS TO NEGOTIATION IS LEARNING HOW TO EXHAUST THE OTHERSIDE AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT A REALLY DANGEROUS ADVERSARY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT TED WE Y U DON'T GO KNOS TO KNOWS YOU DON'T ARGUE YOU DN'T YOU NOT COMBAT IF YOU WEAR M OUT EXHAUSTION AND IF YOU GET SOMEBODY REALLY COMBATIVE OR CUTHROAT ON THE OTHER SIDE START PAPPERIN ON WITH HOW ON WHAT QUESTIONS CAUSE IT EVEN THINK ABOUT THE ANSWER TIRESOM OUT AND IT'S PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE AND IT'S DEFERENTIAL AND IT REALLY WORKS SO IF THE PERSON ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF A HIGH FRICTION NEGOTIATION IS AGGRESSIVE THE GOAL IS TO SLOW THINGS DOWN FATIGUE THEM YE AND GET THEM TO JUST EITHER RELENT OR TO REVEAL SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S A LOOPO YE YE IF IF I HAVE TO MAKE THO DEAL THEN I'M GOING TO WEAR AM OUT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR

GO SO IF WE AGREE TO THIS RIGHT SUT AN NOT CAN TO DRAG THIS THIS GUY ALL THE WAY TO THIS RIVER CROSSING IF THEY DON'T PLAN ON LETIN EM GO AND IF IT'S A LONG WAY TO DRAG EM AND THEY GOT THEIR MONEY DO THEY WANT TO DRAG EM BACK LIKE EVEN IF THEY'R AMBIVILENT ONCE THEY GET THERE IF THEY'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE EFFORT TO GET TO THE MEETING LOCATION AND THE HOSSAGEIS THERE WE'VE NOW JUST INCREASE THE CHANCES SIGNIFICANTLY THEY GON TO GO AHEADNT COMPLY CAUSE ITS PAIN IN THE NACK TO TAKE M BACK THIS IS ALL HUMAN NATURE STUFF HUMAN NATURE AND VESTMENT HOW DO YOU GET EM TO ENGAGE IN ACTIONS IN BEHAVIORS AND THEN VERBAL COMMENTMENTS THAT ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING TO THEM WHEN I WAS WORKIN KIDNAPPINGS THE VERY LAST THING WE'D ALWAYS HAVE THE FAMILY GET THE BAGIES TO SAY AT LAST NOT FIRST BUT LAST WES WE'D ACTUALLY GET A VERBAL PROMISE TO LET EM GO AGAIN AT THE END BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO EM LONG ENOUGH AT THIS PONT OF TIME WE GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT THEY SOUND LIKE WHEN THEY'RE LYING IN WHAT THEY SOUND LIKE WHEN THEY TELL IN THE TRUTH IF SOMEBODY TELLS THE TRUTH THEY PRETTY MUCH TEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME IF THEY TELL THE TRUTH YOU TALK TO SOMEBODY LONG ENOUGH YOU GOT A LYINE ON DO THEY EVER TELL THE TRUTH AND IF THEY DO WHAT IS IT SOUND LIKE PEOPLE LIE TWENTY WAYS THEY TELL THE TRUTH ONE WAY SO WE'VE BEEN COACH IN A NEGOTIATIONS WIT THE KIDNAPPERS LONG ENOUGH THAT WE KNOW WHAT THEY SOND LIKE WHEN THEY TELL THE TRUTH SO WHWHEN THEY ASK IT THE VERY IND IF WE IF WE PAY YOU PROMISE TO LET EM GO IT'S NOT THAT THEY ANSWER BUT HOW THEY ANSWERED T AND THAT THAT'LL BE THE LAST THING TO SEAL THE DEAL YOU NOW HOWD HY CONTINUALLY STACK THE ODS IN YOUR FAVOR FOR IMPLEMENTATION DO YOU HAVE A BODILY LIKE A SOMMATIC SENSEOR FOR LYING OF THE REASON I ASK IS YEARS AGO I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF ON KNOWING SOMEBODY AND THEY TURNED OUT TO BE A GENERALLY GOOD P ERSON BUT I SENSED EARLY ON THAT SOMETHING WAS LIKE OFF I COULDN'T RELAX AROUND THEM I JUST COULDN'T RELAX AROUND THEM AND AND I COULD NOT TELL YOU WHY BUT IT WAS AS IF MY I COULDNT EVEN IDENTIFY THE NERO AN ADOMY OF IT YOU AME I SAY IT WAS THE VAGUEST NERVOUS LAYND BUT I TEACHING OR ANATOMY AND I CAN'T POINT TO ONE PATHWAY IN THE BODY THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT MY AUTONOMIC RESPONSE THAT WOULD JUST START CRANKING UP WHEN I WAS AROUND THEM LIKE SOMETHING AS OFF AS ANYTHING IS OF SOMETHNG US AND IAND I KID YOU NOT FIVE YEARS LATER FIVE YEARS LATER I DISCOVERED A SERIES OF LIES THAT ALL RACHETID TOGETHER THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PRETTY MEANINGLESS IN THE TOTAL CONTEXT OF THINGS BUT I REMEMBER THINKING AT THAT MOMENT OH MY GOODNESS LIKE MY MY SYSTEM KNEW  THE KNEW AND YOU KNOW IT FOR ALL MY KNOWLEDGE OF NARROW SCIENCE I I CAN'T TELL YOU TO THE SDAY LIKE WHAT IT WAS AND IN THE IN MY BIOLOGY BUT IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY BODILY RESPONSE IT WASN'T JUST A THOUGHT LIKE THAT DOESN'T QUITE AT UP WHER I FEEL LIKE CAN GAIN THE RUN AROUND OR OR THIS IT WAS IT WAS A PHYSICAL SENSATION ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT EXPERIENCE YEH WELL IT'S A LITTLE BIT WHAT YOU GUISE IN YOUR COLLEGE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE GOT AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY TEACHING YOU KNOW MY COMPANY NOW WERE TEACHING PEOPLE LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR GOT AND YOUR AMIGULA FOR LACK OF A BETTER TIME YOUR FEERE CENTERS AND KNOW WHICH ONE IS WHICH AND LISTEN TO YOUR GOT YOUR GOT IS RIDICULOUSLY ACCURATE NOW WHERE WHERE DOES THAT INFORMATION COME FROM WHEN YOUR POTCASH RECENTLY I WAS LISTENING TO WO TALKING ABOUT OLA FACTORY TOCUSE RITE THE SMOUSE I CO NEVER THOUGHT OF T HAT COURSE YOU KNOW YT THER E THUM WAS A TERM FOR THE U THER THE MOLCULES ARE YOU PUTTING OFF THAT THAT OH FARI MYEL A FARMOTS WHAT A POAMO MOLLI YOU TEN 'T GET KICKED OUT LIKE OF COURSE AND THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE GREAT INVESTIGATORS I NEW WOULD SAY I CAN JUT SMELL IT I CAN SMELL IT SO WHAT ALL IS FEEDING YOU'RE GOT AND WHAT WHAT ARE THE SENSES THAT THE SCIENCE HASN'T YET DISCOVERED YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T MAKE ME BELIEVE I I WILL NEVER BELIEVE THAT THE LIFE FORCE STOPS AT THE SURFACE OF OUR SKIN THAT THERE'S A ENERGY AND IT WE CAN PICK UP ON THE ENERGY I MEAN OUR GOT IS BEING FED BY ALL THESE DIFFERENT IN PUTS THAT WE'RE AWARE OF OR THAT WE HAVE YET TO BE MADE AWARE OF THE TONE OF VOICE DOESN'T MATCHD THEIR THEIR WORDS THETHAT THE HEAD TELT YOUVE GOT A SUPER COMPUTER IN YOUR BRAIN YOU'RE GOT IS INCREDIBLE IF YOU LISTEN TO IT INSTEAD OF YOUR FIERCE CENTERS AND AS SOON AS YOU START LISTENING TO YOU'RE GOT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT AT THE TIME BUT YOU GOT YOU OT A BAD FEELING IN YOU'R GOT AND LATER ON THEN YOU SAW IT ALL AT ALL CAME TOGETHER WHERE YOUR BRAIN WAS PICKING UP THESE CUES YOUR YOUR BRAIN WAS PROBABLY WHEN YOU 'RE IN THEIR PRESENCE THERE'S GOT O BE IN ODER SOMEBODY GIVES OFF WHEN THEYRE WHEN THEY'RE INTENTIONALLY DECEIVING YOU DON'T YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT ANHAT WAS DISMOLL AND MAYBE YOU COULDN'T HAVE CONSCIOUSLY SMELLED TO BE YOU STILL PICKING IT UP SO LONG ANSWER TO I'M A VERY BIG BELIEVER IN IN THE GOT I THINK THERE'S SCIENCE THAT WE KNOW AND YET TO DISCOVER THAT TELLS US THAT THE GOT IS JUST RIDICULOUSLY ACCURATE IF WE LISTEN TO IT INSTEAD OF OUR FIERCE CENTERS I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THERE ARE ON ENERGETIC EXCHANGE IS THAT NORO SCIENCE CAN'T YET EXPLAIN THE FIELD OF NOR SCIENCE THAT IS IS STARTING TO EXPLORER SOME OF THESE THINGS ON THERE'S BASICALLY A THREE APEX JOURNALS THTHE MOST COMPETITIVE JOURNALS TO PUBLISH IN SCIENCE NATURE AND SELL AND A I ONLY MENTION THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS A SERIES OF ARTICLES WRITTEN IN SCIENCE MAGAZING ABOUT MAGNETO RECEPTION IN HUMANS YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT HUMANS CAN DETECT MAGNETIC FEELD SOUNDS LIKE WUACKERY RIGHT TURTLES CAN DETECT MAGNETIC FEELS THEY MIGRATE BY THEM ACTUALLY LONG DISTANCES BUT THE IDEAS THAT HUMANS CAN'T DO THAT AND YET THERE ARE SOME WELL CONTROLLED STUDIES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO GUESS ABOUT THE ORIENTATION OF A MAGNETIC FIELD AND THEY DO IT BETTER THAN CHANCE NOT EVERYONE CAN DO IT BUT SOME CAN DO IT BETTER THAN CHANCE IN A WAY THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED BY ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT SOME INHERENT FORM OF MAGNETIL RECEPTION IN THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO THERE ARE CAPABILITIES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ARE STARTING TO BE REVEALED FOR WHICH WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE BUT THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THESE THINGS ARE REALLY HAPPENING M THE OTHER EXAMPLE WHICH YOU MIGHT FIND INTERESTING IS A LOBIT A WERE LITTLE LESS ESOTERIC BUT THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL PAPER PUBLISHED IN ONE OF THE SELL PRESS JEURNALS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SHOWING THAT WHEN PEOPLE LISTEN TO THE SAME STORY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIR HEART BEATS TENDS TO BE VERY SIMILAR NOW DOESN'T MEAN THAT THER EXACT HEART RATES ARE SIMILAR BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIR HEART BEATS THEY ALL IN TRAIN TO THE SAME RHYTHM THE SAME SONG GET THIS THERE IN COMPLETELY SEPARATE ROOMS THE EXEXPERIMENTS ARE BEING DONE ON COMPLETE SEPARATE DAYS AND YET IF I WERE TO LINE UP JUST YOU THAT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE THE HEART BEATS FOR YOU THEY WOULD LINE UP LIKE A SET OF COLUMNS OR DOZENS OF INDIVIDUALS LISTENING TO THE SAME STORY SO YOU KNOW CLEARLY THERE'S A PASSAGE OF ENERGY FROM WE HEAR AND THINGS WE SEE THAT GOES INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AT A LEVEL THAT'S BELOW OUR CONSCIOUS DETECTION HERE'S THE LAST THING I'LL SAY ABOUT THIS WE HAVE A SERIES ON MENTAL HEALTH COMING OUT NOT MENTAL ILLNESS BUT MENTAL HEALTH M BY THE A WI THINK TO BE AMONG THE VERY FINEST PSYCHATRIS IN THE WORLD A DOCTOR PALCONTI AND HE SAID YOU KNOW WE ALL THINK THAT THE FOREBRAIN IS THE SUPERCOMPUTER HE SAID NO THE SUBCONSCIOUS IS THE SUPERETHAT'S WHERE THE REAL KNOWLEDGE PROCESSING IS HAPPENING THAT'S THE ICEBERG BELOW THE SURFACE WHERE ALL THE REAL HEAVY LIFTING IS TAKEN PLACE AND THAT PEOPLE WHO LEARN TO TAP INTO THE SUBCONSCIOUS CAN LEARN TO USE THAT INFORMATION IN RY MEANINGFUL WAYS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WY INSCRIVING HE'S BEEN ON WITH YOU BEFORE RIGHT HE HAS TO TALK ABOUT TRAMA IN PARTICULAR AND HE WAS ON LECX FREEDMAN'S PODCAST AS WELL THE SERIES THAT WE'RE DOING WITH HIM IS NOT ABOUT TRAMA PER SET IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND THE SELF I THINK YOU'LL FIND THE SERIES REALLY INTERESTING OAND HAS A NUMBER OF VERY PRACTICAL QUESTIONS THAT ONE CAN ASK THEMSELVES ABOUT THEY'RE SUBCONSCIOUS AND AND CAN WORK THE PROCESS OF PSYCHIOTRY WE'RE EXCITED TO RELEASE THAT SERIES BUT IT UM CAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ANYTHING LIKE IT THAT'S BEEN PUT OUT THERE INTO THE PUBLIC BUT BUT I WAS SO UM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO HEAR HIM SAY YOU KNOW WE ALL HEAR THAT THE FOREBRAIN IS THE SUPERCOMPUTER IT'S WHAT DROVE OUR EVOLUTION AS I NONE NON ON KNOW IT'S IT'S THE SUBCONSCIOUS THAT'S WHERE OUR REAL WISDOM RESIDES AND THE FOREBRAIN IS JUST THE IMPLEMENTATION DEVICE SO IT'S I YOU KNOW I AN WE CAN  CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT THER WERE IN CHARGE I I' I CAN'T THINK OF A TIME THAT MY GOT TOLD ME EH AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE B NEERE OFTEN THAN NOT THOUGH I'VE SUPPRESSED MY RESPONSE RIGHT AGOT I OVERRIDE IT THINKING I THINK I MADE THE MISTAKE THAT YOU GUOS TRAIN YOUR NEGOTIATORS TO AVOID WHICH AS I THOUGHT WELL THIS IS MAKING ME ANXIOUS IN THE ANXIETY MUST BE LIKE ME BUT THIS MUST BE MY FAULT R I'M NOT ABLE TO CALL MYSELF IN THE SITUATION IM NOT SLEEPING WELL ET CETERA AND UM AND THEREFORE LIKE THIS MUCH MUST REPRESENT SOME DEFICIENCY ON MY PART AND THEN UM AND LORD KNOWS AS YOUR SHIRT POINTS OUT I'M I'M A VERY FLOD PERSON I HAVE MANY FLOUHS I ALWAYS HAVE THREE THOUSAND PETPEVES AND AT LEAST AS MANY FLAWS TO MATCH HES I WANT TO ONE AT LEAST RELATIONSHIP BUT I THE POINT BEING THAT I THINK OUR BODIES REALLY DO KNOW THEY KNOW YE YO YE I AGREE SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING NEGOTIATIONS AND YOU'RE HEARING SOMEBODY'S VOICE ON THE PHONE THEY'RE LOT OF CUES WHEN YOU'RE FACE TO FACE THEY'RE ADDITIONAL CUSE THERE'S THEIR FACE AND THEN OF COURSE IF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE BEING DONE BY TEXT OVER A COMPUTERR OF PHONE IT'S A VERY DIMINISHED ENVIRONMENT F RE INFORMATION SO MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT EACH OF THOSE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN THOSE LANDSCAPES IF T W'RE FACE TO FACE AND WE'RE NEGOTIATING AM YOU'RE LISTENING OF COURSE TO WHAT I WANT WHAT I'M INSISTING ON YOU'RE WORKING THAT PROCESS FROM YOUR YOUR SIDE WHAT AR YOU PAYING ATTENTION TO VISUALLY IT'S MORE THAN ARE THINGS IN A LINEMENT THERE'S LAYMON'S DATA O THER WORDS THE WAY IT' SAID AND LOOK ON PEOPLE'S FACE AND HOW ARE THEY WEIGHE AND HOW THEY PLAY OUT THERE'S A RASO OUT THERE THA VERY UN SCIENTIFIC SEME THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE SEME PER CENT WORD THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT DELIVERY FIFTEFI PERCENT BODY LANGUAGE PEOPLE ONT ARGUE ABOUT ITALL THE TIME WHETHER NOT THAT'S ACCURATE IE'S A RULE THOM WE THROW THAT OUT THERE BUT I TELL PEOPLE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS DO THEY LINE UP SO I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK FOR LIKE WHEND YOU RAISE YOUR EYEBROW OR WEN YOU LOOK UP INTO THE LEFT I'M RELY JUST GOING TO TRY TO GET A GOT FEELING WETHER I THINK THESE THINGS ARE LINING UP WHETHER THERE AN ALLIEMENT WHETHER THEY'RE OUT A LINE AND THEN I'M N TO BE REAL CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT MEANING I ASSIGNED TO THAT KNO A AFFECTIVE CUS CHANGES IN YOUR TONE OF VOICE CHANGES IN YOUR MOVEMENT WEN THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE DON'T TEACH READING PEOPLE'S BODY LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY CONTECTUAL TO YOU AND THE MOMENT SO I IF I CONVINCE MYSELF THAT YOU DON'T RAISE O THE EYEBROW MEANS THIS IT'S OUT A CONTEXT I WAS IN A NEGOTIATION ONCE WHOUGH I THROUGHOUT A FIGURE TO SOMEBODY AND I SOME CON LOOK OFF TO SIDE AND LOOK BACK AND ACCEPTED MY OFFER AND I'M MADE THE MISTAKE OF NOT SAYING TO THEM THE PROPRITE THING FOR ME TO SAY AT THE TIME WOULD HAVE BEEND SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING JUST CROSS YOUR MIND CAUSE YOEU ONLY COMPLETELY TRUE OBSERVATION IF THEY LOOKED TO THE SIDE AND LOOK BACK SOMETHING CROSS THEIR MIND NOW I READ IT AT THE MOMENT OF SAYING THAT THEY HAD MORE MONEY AND I FOUND OUT AFTER THE FACT THAT WAS WRONG THEY WERE STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT THE LOOK OF HESITATION DIDN'T MEAN THAT THEY WERE HOLDIN STUCP THEY WERE HOLDING STEP BACK BUT I READ IT WRONG  AND I DIDN'T BOTHER TO CHECK ON THE AFFECTIVE CUE THAT I SAW SO WONE AR MY BABBLING ABOUT WHAT I'M BABBLING ABOUT IS IF WE'RE IN A NEGOTIATION AND WHETHER NOT I'M LISTENING TO YOUR TONE OF VOICE OR WATCHING YOUR BODY LANGUAGE OR YOUR WORDS IF I SEE YOU SHIFT AT ALL I SHOULD PAY ATTENTION THAT THERE WAS A SHIFT IN YOUR AFFECTIV BEHAVIOR BUT I NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS BEHIND IT AS OPPOSED TO MAKE AN AN ASSUMPTION AS TO WHAT IT MEANT SEE I'M GOING TO WATCH ONLY GET MY GUT FEELING AND I'MAN TO SAY SOUNDS LIKE THAR'S SOME HESITATION OR IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING JUST CROSS YOUR MIND OR EVEN IF I CAN'T ATTRIBUTED TO SPECIFIC AFFECTIVE MOVE I MIGHT SAY IF FEELS LIKE TO SOMETHING IN THE WAY THAT'S ME LISTENING TO MY GOT I'LL THREW OUT AN OBSERVATION ON WHATEVER ANY OF THOSE MIGHT BE JUST TO GO BACK OVER THE GROUND THE LITTLE BIT AND DOUBLE CHECK CAUSE THE OTHER THING ABOUT NEGOTIATING IN PERSON IS YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME MORE INFORMATION PHYSICALLY THAN I CAN ACTUALLY PROCESS AND IF YOU SAY SOMETHING THAT'S THOUGHT PROVOKIN I'LL STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT AND WHILE I'M STOPING AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SET I MISSIN ALL YOUR CUES SO ALL THE SKILLS THAT WE TEACH THE LABELS THE MIRRORS THE OPENING TO QUESTIONS WHICH SEEMED LIKE WERE GOING BACK AND PLOUG ON THE GROUND AGAIN WE ARE BECAUSE I DIDN'T PICKED UP ALL THE INFORMATION A FIRST TIME THERE JUST MORE THAN THAN I CAN GET AND SO I NEED TO GO BACK OVER IT A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH YOU JUST SO I GET IT RIGHT WITHOUT MAKING YOU FEEL INTERROGATED YOU ACTUALLY FEEL HURD AND YOU ACTUALLY GET TO GO BACK OVER IT AGAIN SO IT BECOMES WHAT SEEMS TO BE AN INEFFICIENT PROCESS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ME JUST DOUBLESHECK IN MY INFORMATION SO FOR FACE TO FACE I'M GOIN A BUT ASK YOU TO REPEAT BUT I'M NOT GOT TO SAY WOULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT I'M AN TO GETS YOU TO REPEAT WITHOUT ASKING YOU TO REPEAT IS THE SAME TRUE IN AN ONLINER TEXT COMMUNICATIONS THE SAME THING IS TRULY THA THE PROBLEM WITH ON LINE OF TAXAS PEOPLE TRY TO BUNDLE EVERYTHING INTO ONE COMMUNICATION THE BEST ANALOGY I CAN THINK OF IS IF YOU'R PLAIN CHESS BY TEXT WOULD YOU PUT SEVEN MOVES IN YOUR  COMYOUR TEXT NO YOU'D ONLY PUT ONE MOVEINT SO ONLY TRY TO GET ONE POINT ACROSS IN A TEXT DON'T EXPLAIN DON'T THROW A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF AN TEXTER EMALES THEY'RE ALL ALMOST ALWAYS TOO LONG AND IT'S GOING TO COME OFF IS COLD SO DO WHAT YOU CAN TO SOFTEN SOFTEN IT IM IS A DOCUMENTARY FILM HAS BENT ON ON MY COMPANY CALL TACTICAL YMPATHY NICNANTON A ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE EMYS THE PHILM MAKR DEAN F DEIN A FILMS WHOAS FINISHD LAST SHE IS NOT

DERK DER CALENDER HES SUS DONE IT'S DONE WE GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES NOW THING OF THE NORMAL NEGOTIATION AY NICK HOW ARE YO WHAT'S GOING ON TO DAY ARE YOU IN A GOOD MOOD HA HAY HA HOW THE KID'S DOING ALL THIS TIME WASTING CONVERSATION FI TO SET HIM UP WITH THAT NORMAL HE WOULD ALSO HE COULD HAVE LEGITIMATELY SAID ARE YOU OTE IND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR YEAR YOU DIDN'T BRING THIS UP IN A YEAR NOT ONLY THAT YOU ALREADY TOLD ME TWO DAYS AGO AT THE ETE SHOWING AND AN VAGUST THAT YOU LOVED IT AND NOW A YEAR YOU'RE AND A HALF INTO THIS PROJECT YOU'RE BRINGING UP ALL THESE NEW PROMIS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NORMAL NEGOTIATION BUT SINCE I SINCE WE GOT A HIGHLY CLABT OF RELATIONSHIP I TWO LINE TEXT WE DONE IN TEN MINUTES NOW SINCE NEXT TE VERY GENEROUS GY WHEN HE GETS DONE AND HE SAYS BY THE WAY YOU UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS GUN A COST ME IS TIS THREE WEEKS ATUDAY THIS IS THREE HOURS AS SHOOTING IN THREE WEEKS OF EDITY AGR HE GOES BUT I'MHAPPY TO DO IT CALLS HIM BACK THE NEXT DAY IT'S GOT A FAVORITE ASK OR ME YOU GOT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS BECAUSE WE'D GONE THROUGH WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY COMPLICATED NEGOTIATION IT STARTED ON TAXT AND I SENT HIM A TWO LINE TEXT ON A SUNDAY AND WE GET A SALVE THAT FAST SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY BY SETTING THE CONTEXT IN A VERY DIRECT AND SUSSINCT WAY WRIGHT HE GOES INTO IT IN A PROBLEM SOLVING MODE WITH YOU WHEREAS IF YOU DO THE UM THE TOUR OF ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING WELL IN LIFE YEE  YE HAV THE SORT OF THE UM WELL KEEP THIS A P G YOU KNOW THE THE U THE MUD SAND WHICH APPROACH YOU KNOW NOW THEY TEACH YOU THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET A LAVRI TRIT YOU' OL MOST SCIENTIST AT RAN SKILL RUNNING AF BUSINESS RIGHT YOU GET A LABORATORY ALL YOU DONE IS EXPERIMENTS AND THEN SUDDENLY YOAR IN CHARGE OF PEOPLE MANAGING BUDGETS AND ALL THIS STUFF I M MEAN MOST SCIENTISTS NINETY NINE PRESENT A SCIENCIS A COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED TO DO THE JOB THEY DO AT THE LEVEL RUNNING LABORATORY WHEN THEY START YOU LEARN IT ON THE JOB AND EVENTUALLY YOU END UP HAVING LET SOMEBODY GO AND TOY AND SO THE TYPICAL THING THEY TEACH YOU IN THESE ONLINE TRAINING THINGS IS YOU TELL SOME THAT HY SOMETHING NICE THEN YOU GIVE THEM THE BAD NEWS AND THEN YOU TELLS SOMETHING THEM SOMETHING NICE ON EXIT RA IT'S GRANDA TA THE THE MUD SO TO SPEAK SANDWHICH RIGHT NO RIGHT AM THIS IS NOT THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SAYING HEY THIS IS THE PROBLEM YOU'RE NOK IN A LIKE THE PROBLEM OR THERE IS A PROBLEM YOU'RE NOT IN A LIKE IT SO THAT THEY SHOW UP WITH THE CONTEXT OF SOLVING A PROBLEM I SUPPOSE TO GIVING THEM THE TOUR OF ALL THE THINGS ARE GOING WELL AND THEN THE THE PROBLEM IS REALLY IN CONTRAST TO THAT AND THEN IT'S LIKE UH YOU NOW SAY SO YOU WHAT I LOVE ABOUT WHAT YOURE DESCRIBING IS IT'S IT'S IT'S DIRECT IT'S HONEST YOU'RE NOT DOING THE A THE TOUR OF THE GARDEN BEFORE YOU TAKE THEM DOWN TO THE U TO THE SCEPTICTANK IT'S WHAT I WOULD CALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING BLUNT AND BEING A STRAIGHT SHOOTER A STRAGE SHOOTER TELLS YOU THE TRUTH THEY JUST TELL IT IN A WAY THAT LAND SOFTLY LET'S TALK ABOUT BREAK UPS BUSINESS BREAK UPS ROMANTIC BREAK UPS RIGHT YOU BREAK IN UP WITH ME NONO AM BUT THANKS FOR THE HYPOTHESIS TEST NO  A IN FACT I'M ENJOYING THIS CONVERSATION SO MUCH AS I ALWAYS DO I'M LEARNING ITS ONE FROM YOU THAT AM IF ANYTHING I'D LIKE TO EXPAND AND DEEPEN OUR RELATION THER YALA KNOWLEDGE AT AM A PLATONIC AND AN PROFESSIONAL BUT EXPANSIV AM WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF ENDING A RELATIONSHIP AND AGAIN THIS COULD BE ROMANTICALLYTIIP COULD BE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP COULD BE EMPLOYER EMPLOY COULD BE INDIVIDUALS COULD BE TELLING A WHOLE GROUP OR AN ENTIRE GROUP TELLING AN INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW THE REASON I RAISE THIS AS A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE IS THAT UM I'M ASSUMING THAT BOTH SIDES DON'T WANT THE SAME THING ONE SIDE WANTS TO CONTINUE THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO END I AM I'LL AVOID THE USE OF THE WORD WINWI N WORED THE WORDS WINWIND EXCUSE ME AND JUST ASK IS THERE A WAY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IN ANY OF THE CONTACTS I JUST MENTION IN A AS YOU SO BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBED IT A STRAIGHT SHOOT OR MANNER WHERE IT'S DIRECT IT'S HONEST BUT IT LANDS SOFT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS FEELINGS OF REJECTION AND NOBODY LIKES FEELING REJECTED  I DO'T KNOW ANYBODY LIKES BEING FIRED EVEN FROM JOBS THEY DON'T LIKE PEOPLE'S EGOES SOFFER RAIN SO IS THERE A MAY BE AT MORE SPECIFIC WAY OF ASKING THE QUESTION IS IS THERE A WAY TO ENCOURAGE THE PERSON GETTING THE BAD NEWS TO GET THERE EGO OUT OF THE WAY AND SEE THAT IF BOTH PARTIES DON'T WANT IT IT'S BEST FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED I ALMOST WANT TO SAY NO A BUT FIRST HONE OF THE CAVIATS MOST OF A TIME WHEN PUPILIS STRUGGLING WITH THIS THEY NOT TRYING TO SAVE THE OTHER SIDE THO TRY TO SAVE THEMSELVES SO O YOU REALLY TRYI TO SAVE BY POST PONING AT SOFTIN AND YOU KNOW TRY TO AC LIKE A IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS NOT THERE I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY HAS EVER BEEN FIRED THAT DIDN'T HAVE A SENSE THAT IT WAS COMING THE PERSON THAT WAS GETTING READY TO FIRE M OPENS UP BY SAYING HOW ARE YOU ITHEY KNOW HOW THE OTHER PERSON IS AND IN A PERSON GETTING READY TO GET FIRED HAS GOT SOME GOT INSTINCT THAT THINGS ARE GOING WRONG LIKE YOU SAID THE GUTS VERY POWERFUL SO YOU GOT YOU GOT A LOWER THE BOOM AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN BUT ALSO AS GENTLY AS YOU CAN I WAS INVOLVED IN A NON PROFIT A NUMBER YEARS AGO FILIATED WITH CHURCH AND WE TRYNT STRUGGLING WHETHER NOT TO LET THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GO OR GO TO THE MINISTER OF THE CHURCH NORMAN VINCENT PEALS PROTEGE GOT I GY NAME ARTHUR CALLIANDER ONE OF THE BEST HUMAN BEINGS I'VE EVER MET MY LIFE PHENOMENA GRI AND I'M STRUGGLING WITH I THOUGHT FIRING LETNESS WOMAN GO WAS GOING T BE BAD AND I THOUGHT ARTHUR WAS GOING TO COUNTIL ME AWAY OUT AND AND HE LOOK TO MEAN HE SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S NO GENTLE WAY TO CUT SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF AND I THOUGHT YE AD THE HUMANE THING HERE IS HOWDY TO TO BRING IT TO CONCLUSION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE CAUSE THERE'S NO HUMANE WAY TO CUT SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF THERE'S NO HUMANE WAY IN TO TERMINATE THER RELATIONSHIP NOW WHAT O THE CAVIETS MAYBE THERE ARE FIRST CAVYAD IF YO CAN'T FIRE SOMEBODY NEVER FIRE SOMEBODY ON A FRIDAY FIRE HIM ON A MONDAY FIR HEM ON A MONDAY THEY GOT A WORK WEEK TO WORK THEIR WAY OUT OF IT YOU FIRE HIM ON A FRIDAY THEY GOT A WEEK IND TO BE MISERABLE AN TO FEEL HORRIBLE AND THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT CAUGHT OFF GUARD OR NOT ON A MONDAY THEY CAN PICK THEMSELVES UP THEY CAN START LOOKING FOR NEW JOB NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE FI EM ON A FRIDY THEY CAN'T START LOOKING FOR NEW JOB ON A SATURDAY IT'S TWO DAYS ON MISERY SO YET YOU GING TO FIRE SOMEBODY FIRE HIM ON A MONDAY NOT ON A FRIDAY YOU GOT BAD NEWS TER GIVE SOMEBODY WARNAMENT'S COMING THE UM PEOPLE ARE RIDICULOUSLY RESUMIANT TO PAIN IF WARNED AND THEN THAT YOU LOWER THE BOOM AND I CAN'T LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS GON TO BE HEART BREAKING YOU CANTA HATE ME HESITATE NO MORE H'N THREE SECONDS THEY GOT THEIR GUARD UP LET EM HAVE THE BAD NEWS THAT'S THE HUMANE WAY TO CUT SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF DON'T MAKE DON'T LINGER DON'T MAKE EM THINK THAT HOW THE KIDS HOWARE YOU I CARE ABOUT YOU YOUR GREAT HUMAN BEING NOTE O STUFF AT THE BEGINNING WARN EM BAD NEWS IS COMING AND HAD HIM WITH THE BAD NEWS RIPP THE BANDATE OFF THE PAIN IS NOT IF YOU TRY TO RIP THE BANDATE OFF SLOWLY THAT'S EXCRUCIATING YOU TRYING TO SAVE YOURSELF SO IF YOU OT TO TERMINATE A RELATIONSHIP REGARDLESS OR WHAT IT IS THE QUICKER IT YOU DO IT THE LESS PAINLESS IT IS THE SOONER PEOPLE CAN MOVE ON STOP TRYG TO SAVE YOURSELF REALIZE HOW HUMAN BEINGS HANDLE PAIN IF ANYTHING HUMAN BEINGS ARE INCREDIBLY RESUMIN IF GIVIN THE OPPORTUNITY O BRACE THEMSELVES FIRST I AGREE THANK YOU FOR THAT THERE'S A CONCEPT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T HEARD OF AND I'M CONFIDENT IN SAYING THAT BECAUSE I HADN'T HEARD OF INTIL RECENTLY IN DESPITE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME AN THE LITERATURE ROUND DOPAMIN AND MOTIVATION AND IT'S A TERM FROM PSYCHOLOGY THAT IT'S BEING USED A LITTLE BIT MORE NOW UM AND IT'S EGO DEPLETION YET IT'S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT AND I'VE BEEN WING TO RUN THIS BY YU FOR A WHILE BUT I SAVED IT FOR OUR DISCUSSION TODAY IT TURNS OUT EGO DEPLETION IS A LOT LIKE DECISION FATIGUE UM YOU KNOW WE'V ALL HEARD THE STEEVE JOBS THING YOU KNOW HE WORE A BLACK TURTLE NECK EVERY DAY BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW HE'D NENHOUE TO WHEN THAT DESISION SO WE HAD MORE ENERGY TO MAKE OTHER DECISIONS I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF DOING THE SAME BECAUE OF MY BLACK LONG SLEEVE SURS BUT THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER REASON FOR THAT THAT U'M SOME PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW BUT HEY WAY IT'S UNIMPORTANT IN THE MOMENT UM BUT EGO DEPLETION IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN DECISION FATIGUE OR DEECISION BUT IT U THE IDEA WITH EGO DEPLETION IT'S PRETY SIMPLE IT'S THAT THE MOLECULE DOPAMEAN DOESN'T MANY THINGS IN THE BRAIN BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT ABSOLUTELY DOES IS IT HOLDS US TO GOL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH OUR SENSE OF SELF LIKE I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS I WANT TO GET TO THAT AND THE WHOLE NOTION OF EGO DEPLETION INVOLVES THE THE IDEA AND THIS HAS BEEN A DATA SUBSTANTIATED OBSERVATION THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO FIGHT TO BE RIGHT OR TO DEFEND THEIR POSITION FOR A PERIOD OF TIME EVENTUALLY THAT DEPLETES AND IT SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST IN PART DOPAMEN MEDIATED BECAUSE DEFENDING ONE'S POSITION TAKES WORK YOU EARLIER YOU TALK ABOUT RUNNING SOMEBODY DOWN YOU KNOW UM WEARING THEM OUT AND I WONDER AS I JUST THROW THIS CONCEPT OUT YOUD UM A COLD HERE AM WHETHER R NOT THAT CALLS TO MIND ANY A EXAMPLES FROM YOUR WORK WHERE YOU FELT LIKE OCATE LIKE THIS PERSON COULD REALLY HOLD BUT IF I JUST KEPT PRESSING EVENTUALLY THEYD TILT I YOU KNOW AND IT'S DIFFERENT IN THE KIND OF FATIGUE THAT COMES FROM A CONVERSATION THAT STARTS AT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON AND ENDS AT TWO THIRTY IN THE MORNING WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE I'VE BEEN IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS USUALLY THEY'RE NOT VERY PLEASANT AND AT THREE ON THE MORNG EVERYIN'S PEALIND APART YOU JUST I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS YOU KNOW LIKE YECLIPIT AT NINE THIRTY AND YOU TRYING SHIFT RIGHT HE KNO ONE OF THE WORST PIECES OF ADVICE I'VE EVER HEARD AM IS YOU'D NEVER GO TO SLEEP ANGRY BU NO ATUALLY A ACTUALLY GET SLEEP WAKE UP AND THEN REVISIT THE PROBLEM IF THE SITUATION ALLOWS THAT'S MY A THAT'S MY I'M VERYM YA A  TRY TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT TRYING TO WORK SOMETHING OUT IS JUST COUNTER BIOLOGY SO EGO TOPLETION AM I'VE A FEELING A LOT OF WHAT YOU DID IN YOUR PROFESSION WAS AM RUNNING DOWN THERE DOPE MEN TO THE POINT WHERE THEN THEY ARE OPERATING FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE WHERE THEY'RE NOT DEFENDING THE EGO THEY'RE ACTUALLY THINKING MORE PRACTICALLY ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION IS IS HAVE ANY KIND OF TEXTER OF MEANING TO YE NO I WOULD II WOULD AGREE AND I WOULD  DRAW THE DISTINCTION A FIRST OF ALL IN HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION THERE'S THERE'S TWO KIND OF HOSTAGE TAKINGS AM IF THERE'S A DEMAND A AN IS GOING TO BE CONTAINED AND UNCONTAINED WHICH IS JUST LITERAL DEFINITION CONTAINED IS BAGASES IN A BANK LIKE AT THE CHASEBANK IN BROOKLYND WAY BACK WHEN YOU CAN N'M SURROUNDED THEY CAN'T GET AWAY AN UNCONTAINED IS A KITNAPPING YOU KNON'T NOW WHERE THEY ARE UNCONTAINED ON A LOCATION WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET OUR WAY AND I CONTAIN SITUATION PROBABLY BY EGO DOPLETION WERE 'N AMOUNT GETTIN TO THE POINT WHERE THEY JUST I JUST I JUST GOING TO GIVANKAS I ARE TIRED CAUSE THE GOIN TO COME OUT WERE OINGTO PUT HANDCUFFS ON UM WHICH MEANS THAT IF THE EGLE GETS RECHARGED THEY GOIG O GO BACK IN TOR THINK THEYREGONG TO THINK BACK OVER THE DEAL SO WHEREIN SOMEBODY OUT O BUSINESS NEGOTIATION IT'S BASICALLY UNCONTAINED BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU COME TO AN AGREEMENT THERE'S A WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE THEY GONG TO G IT DID YOU DID YOU GET YOU AGREEM TOYU WARM OUT CAUSE THEY GET TIRED CAUSE HE JUST GAVE IN AT SOME POINT OF TIME THEY'REGOIGTO GET RECHARGED AND THEYR GOING TO GET RECHARGED WHERE YOU'E IN IMPLEMENTATION SO THEY EITHER GOING A NOCKON O FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THE DEAL OR IT'S THE SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY THEY'REGOING TO DEVIATE AND SO YET I THINK EGLE DEPLETION IS IS A REAL THING AND IT'S A BAD WAY TO GET A BUSINESS DEAL THAT'S GOING TO STICK CAUSE THEY REST AND THAN THEY COME BACK YE I DIFFERENT PERSON YEYE'RE THEY GOING TO BE RECHARGED THEY'RE EGLE'S GOING TO BE RECHARGED AND IF YOU GET THE IF YOU GT THE AGREEMENT BASED ON A DEPLETION OF THEIR EGO THAT BATTERY'S GOING TO GET CHARGE BACK UP AGAIN WELL IT'S A BUSINESS DEAL WITH ITS PERSONAL NEGOTIATION YOU DON'T YOU HAVE DISAGREEMENT WE THE SIGNIFICANT OTHER WHO AND YOU YOU FOLLOW THAT BAD ADVICE DON'T GO TO BED ANGRY AND SO YOU STAY UP TILL THREE IN THE MORNING AND YOU THINK YOU COME TO A RESOLUTION  BUT HE GETS A GOOD NEXT SLEEPN NEXT DAY THEY FEEL COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT THEY SAID THE IGHT BEFORE I MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THAT HAPPENING ONCE OR TWICE ITS OUGHT TO MOVE YOUR YES HNTE TIM OF YA A FRIEND EXPLAIN THAT SITUATION TO ME U EARLIER YOU MENTION APPROACHING A CONVERSATION IN A PLAYFUL WAY RANG ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW THIS MIGHT IN'T BE LIFE OR DEATH BUT LET'S PLAY THITS LIKE A GAME BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE MORE OPPORTUNITIES NOW WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE ARE RELAXED WE SEE THE BIG PICTURE WHEN WE'RE TENSE EVERYTHING NEVER ONS WAT IS YOUR TUNNAL VISAN TUNNEL THINKING TONNEL EVERYTHING WE LOSE OCCESS TO THE FULL TOOL KIT IM SO YOU ALWAYS SEE TAKE REALLY TO CARRY YOURSELF YOU'RE FIT YOURE IN SHAPE YOU ALWAY SEEM CALM I'M SURE OU HAVE YOUR MOMENTS LIKE ANYBODY ELSE BUT UM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT GOOD NEGOTIATORS DO ALL THE TIME SO THAT WHEN THE BELL GOES OFF AND THEY HAVE TO RESPOND THEY ARE READY AND THE REASON I ASK IS IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS IN KIND OF A VACUE LIKE IT'S HAPPENING AND HOW DOES ONE HANDLE IT BUT LIKE ANY ATHLETE LIKE ANY TEACHER LIKE ANY PARENT LIKE ANY KID EVERYBODY

EXPERIENCES ARESELF I LIKE THE QUESTION UM YOU KNOW HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING IT'S PRETTY OPEN ENDED UM IT'S I SUPPOSE IF SOMEBODY WAS REALLY UPSET THAT WOULD BE PERHAPS THE WORST QUESTION I COULD POSSIBLY ASK UM FROM WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED BUT WE DON'T PUT A FINE POINT ON IT TOO BECAUSE LIKE I'V MANIPULATE HIM WITH WHAT HE LOVE ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S IT YOU WATCH THEM CHANGE IN THE MOMENT TO IMMEDIATELY TO SHIFT INTO THIS CONCEPT OF LOVE WHICH IS MORE THAN LIKE WOUTD YOU LIKE ABOUT DRIVING FRT LIFT WOUTD YOU LOVE ABOUT DRIVIN FOLIFT I I CAN TRIGGER A STAYE CHANGE IN YOU INSTANTANEOUSLY NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF MOODMENT CAUSE THIS GY WAS IN A VERY BAD MOOD PLUS ADDITIONALLY THE DOWNLOAD FROM THAT TYPICALLY IS SO QUICK I MEAN TO GET A REAL CLEAR PICTURE ON WHO YOU ARE REALLY REALLY FAST I'M TALKING TO A SEE YOU OF A COMPANY COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THERE THERE THE YOU KNOW FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM THAN DELIVER IN CLEAN WATER TO THE WORLD AND IM IE THAT'S A COOL MISSION LIKE I DIG THIS IS AN AUNTRO PENOORE AN AUNT YOUE BEEN MORE WANT TO MAKE A DENT UNIVERSE I DIG THAT I I'M TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD SO I SAY TO HIM WHAT YOU LOVE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO FOR LIVE HE IMMEDIATELY FIRES BACK O ME I LOVE LEADING TEAMS I LOVE LEADING TEAMS AND I LOVE GIVEN SHEREHOLD IS A GREAT RETURN ON OUR VESTMENT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GIVE SHEREHOLD IS A GREAT RETURN AND THEN YE YOU KNOW WE DELIVER WATER AND THEN HE SET A FOR THING AND I THOUGHT THIS GUYT COULD BE DOING TOILET PAPER HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE MISSION OF A COMPANY AT ALL HE'S A GREAT SEE YOU PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE YOU TO LEAD TEAMS YOU WANT TO SEE YOU DELIVER A CORPORIT S OU TO H DELIVER A RETURNOL VESTMENT FOR SHAREHOLDERS BUT THAT'S WHAT HE'S A GREAT CORPORITS Y AND NOT A GREAT ANTRO PINORLSY YOU KNOW SO BY HIM GIVIN ME THAT DOWNLOAD RO QUICK THAT WAS BLATENLY HONEST I DO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT GUY YEH DO OUR COR VALUES LINE UP MY MISSION IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN HIS MISSION IS OR HIS MISSION IS MAKIN MONEY NOW I LIKE MAKING MONEY BUT IT'S NOT NUMBER ONE IT'S A STRONG NUMBER TOO BUT THAT QUESSION INSTEAD OF HOW ARE YOU TO DAY TO WHAT ARE YOU LOVE ABOUT YOU IMMEDIATELY PUT HIM IN A BETTER PLACE PLUSH YOU GET SOME RIDICULOUSLY CANDID ANSWERS THAT TELLS YOU WHO THEY ARE REAL FAST WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH OUR RESPONSE TO SOMEBODY WHOIS ASKING TO BE HEARD PERHAPS THEY'VE GOT COMPLAINTS A THEYBE ABOUT US MAYBE ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE ONT PEOPLE ARE VENTING PEOPLE SEEM TO VERY ON THE PROPENSITY TO VENT ESPECTRUM SOMEPEOPLEE JUST YOU KNOW THEY VENT ALL THE TIME THIS HAPPEN THAT HAPPENED AND YOU KNOWHEN THEY WANT TO COMPLAIN YOU KNOW THE A THE WAY IT'S SOMETIMES DESCRIBEAS THEY LOVE TO AND TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S INVENTORIES THEY LOVE TO TAKE INVENTORIES OF EVERYBODY ELSE'S MISTAKES THEY DID THIS THEY DID THAT M YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A LOT EASIER SOME OFTEN THAN TAKING OUR OWN INVENTORIES OFOF WHAT WE COULD BE FOCASSED ON AND DO BETTER THAT'S THAT T'S THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH IN MY MIND BUT YOU NON'T PEOPLE APPROACH OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY TRUST AND THEY WANT EVENT PRESUMABLY TO GET OVER WHATEVER IT IS THAT IS BOTHERING THEM BUT ALL TOO OFTEN IT SEEMS TO JUST AMPLIFY THE FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WHAT O YOU DO WHEN SOMEBODY CARE ABOUT N THAT CARES ABOUT YOU COMES TOET EVENT IS IT JUST YOU LET THEM YOU LET THEM VENT OR TO U UM DO YOU TRY AND LET THEM NEGOTIATE WITH THEMSELVES LITTLE BIT IN A WAY THAT CAN HELP THEM MORE THAN IF YOU WERE TO JUST LET THEM VENT I'M REALLY LEORY OF LETTING PEOPLE VENT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES IT US THEY NEVER IT SEEMS TO BE ASPIRAL THAT JU SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL UM SO HOWTO WHY SOMEBODY VENIT THEY DON'T FEEL HEARD THEY FEEL IGNORED IF YOE LIKE TOVE BEEN WASTING ER TIME TALK THEY'RE FRUSTRATED THAT'S THE FEED BACK IM MOINGTO GIVE YOU FEED BACK ON WHAT I'M GUESSING CAUSE IS CAUSING YOU TO VENT IN JUST AN OBSERVATION I IT IS SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS IS TO TRIVE NEW CRAZI CAS NOBODY LISTENS TO YOU SOUNDS I GEVEN STRUGGLING WITH US FOR A LONG TIME SOUNDS LIKE THIS AS VERY FRUSTRATING FOR YOU UM WHAT'S THE EMOTION THE PARTICULAR NEGATIVE EMOTION FRUSTRATION IS ABOUT SOMEBODY BEING DENIED A GOAL IN FUTURE ANGERIS ABOUT SOMEBODY'S UPSET ABOUT SOME HAPPEN IN A PAST THE TYPE OF NEGATIVE EMOTION BEGINS THA FOCUS YOU WIN ON WHERE THEY IS IT FORWARD THINKING OR IS BACKWARD THINKING AND FRUSTRATION AND ANGER CAN BE TOO VERY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME NEGATIVE EMOTION BUT THEIR FOCUSED ON DIFFERENT POINTS AN TIME SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO INTUITIVELY IF I DON'I DON'T KNOW UM FROM WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME I MIN A START TAKE AN EDUCATED GUESSES ON MAKING AN OBSERVATION ON WHAT IT IS TO DRIVE IN YOU IF YOU NEED DEVENT YOUVE BEEN TALKING AND PEOPLE BEEN IGNORE NG YOU OR YOU'VE BEEN TAKING ACTIONS AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IGNORING YOU TS AT YOU NEED EVENT BECAUSE YOU COMMUNICATION ROACTIONS HAVE BEEN IGNORED THERE ARE SOME CLUSE HERE AND THE SOONER THAT I GET AT THE HEART OF WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU THE SOONER YOU GEN TO BE ABLE AT AT OF SO I'M GOIN TO ENCOURAGE LETTING THE STEAM OFF WITHOUT TRYING TO HAVE CORRECT YOU WITHOUT GIVING YOU ADVISE UM WITHOUT FRUSTRATING YOU BY NOT LISTENING TO YOU BY TRYING TO RECOGNIZE VERBLY WITH SOME EMOTIVATORS ARE WHICH WILL DEACTIVATE THE ANGER MUCH MORE QUICKLY IT'S THE WHOLE BASIS FOR CRISIS HOT LINE TO BEGIN WITH PEOPLE ARE VENTING AND SO HOW DO YOU MOST EFFECTIVELY VENT SOMEBODY SO THAT INSTEAD OF GOING ON A RAN FOR AN HOUR AND THE RANT INTRODUCE TOXENTON TO THEIR SYSTEM RATHER POISONG THEMSELVES I THINK NEGATIVE EMOTIONS PUT TOXINS IN OUR SYSTEM YOU KNW HOW TO I DEACTIVATE THAT IS QUICKLY SO THAT YOU NOT HURTING YOURSELF AS MUCH AND AND YOU YOU FEEL HURRD YOU FEEL RELIEVED YOU FEEL LISTEN TO SO M IN INTHIN INVOLVES ME IF IT'S A CLOSE FRIEND WHO'S VENTING TO YOU YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A SITUATION TO SOME DEGREE AND I MIGHT EVEN SAY BUT IT FEELS LIKE YOU PROBATLY FRUSTRATE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T LISTEN TO YOU TO NOW YOAU OMIN A TART START TAKING SOME EMOTIONALLY EDUCATED GUESSES ON WHAT I THINK IS DRIVING YOU AND I'M AT PUT IN THE FORM OF LABEL WHICH IS JUST AN OBSERVATION SEEMS LIKE SOUNDS LIKE LOOSHLIKE THEN IF I GET IT WRONG AND YOU GO LESS NOT AT AT ALL I CAN SAY WELL THAT JUST A WAY IT SEEMS IT JUST SEEMS THAT WAY OU PUT YOU IN A POSITION JO TOJUST LET SOMEBODY KNOW YOU SEE EM AN YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST UNDERSTAND I'M I'M NOT A FAN OF VENTING I IF IF I GO ON A RANT PERSONALLY I ALWAYS FEEL WORSE SO I WANT TO DEACTIVATE THAT NEGATIVITY SO AN GET GET MY FEET BACK UNDER ME EMOTIONALLY VERY USEFUL NOW LEGE I INTERSHARED WITH US DO YOU MEDITATE I TINY LITTLE BITS I MEAN A IN TRYING TO MAKE MY DAY MORE EFFECTIVE I HAVE A GRATITUDE EXERCISE THAT UM I DO ALMOST EVERY MORNING UM OTHER WAYS TO MAKE MYSELF EFFECTIVE ACTUALLY I'M LOOKING AT THE NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST PRACTICE OR THE BECAUSE I YOU N I I LIKE TO MAKE USE OF MY TIME SO AND AND IAM SPIRITUAL SO UM UMI'M TALKING TO THE ALMIGHTY ON REGULAR BASIS YOU PRAY I DO YE THE MORNING AND NIGHT WHEN YOU NEED TO BOTH YET BOTH I MEAN I THINK YOU KNONT WHETHER NOT YOU BELIEVE IN ONE GOD OR A THE UNIVERSAL WHATEVER IT IS I THINK SPIRITUAL SPIRITUALITY IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF HEALTH WHATEVER YOU SPIRITUALITY IS YOU SHOULD RECOGNIZE IT AND YOU SHOULD YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF IF YOU ENGAGE IN SOME SORT OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN EITHER THREE MAJOR RELIGIONS BUT SPIRITUALITY IS COMPONENT WHO WE ARE SO YE PRACTICED OR REGULARBISES SO SENSE OF HIGHER POWER OR UM TO BETTER DEFIND HIGHER POWER IT COULD BE AS YOU SAID WITH ALINED WITH CONVENTIONAL RELIGION OR JUST A LINED WITH THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE THINGS OUTSIDE OF US THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT WE CAN ALL DO BETTER BY BEING IN RECOGNITION OF OUR SERVICE TO OR WERE BOTH ESOMETHING LIKE I VE DO PRETTY MUCH LIKE THAT AND AND AN LEAVING IS IS OPENI IS AS POSSIBLE CAUSE ER I THINK THERE'S A SPIRITUAL ANSWER TO US PURIT I AGREE WHAT ABOUT YOUR PHYSICAL TRAINING I I MUST SAY YOU KNOW YEUR UM YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT SHAPE IMAGINE THAT WHEN OR ALONG WITH THE F B I THING I AND I SAW SILENCE THE LAMBS AT THE BEGINNING SHES RUNNING AROUND A WITH OTHER ON AGENTS H A UM SHOOTING TARGETS AND RUNNING AND LIFTING INTO AN THEIR SIT UPS IN THERE YOU KNOW THAT WAS A IT WAS NINETEEN EIGHTIES FILM SAYS WAT DATED NOW PROLY NOW THAT THEY'RE DO ANOTHER STUFF AS WELL AM BUT YOU KNOW NOTHING NOTHING WORSE LIKE THE BASIX SO IM WAS THE EF BE I

HACK WELL E LAT WE LIKE MECHANISM SCIENTIS LIKE MECHANT YES YE A HACK SORT OF IMPLIES THAT WE'RE USING ONE THING TO CAL FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT I LIKE MECHANISMS BUT THE END OF THE DAY IF SPEOPLE WANT TO CALL SOMETHING A HACK BECAUSE IT GETS THEM THE RESULT THEY WANT OR THAT THEY'RE MERE IT'S MORE APPEALING TO TO APPLY THE TOOL THAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO ME UT TOOLS SITTING IN A BOXDON'E DO ANYTHING PEOPLE USING HEM THAT I'M GOOD WITH THE TERM YEA SO WHAT THESE DAYS COLD PLUNGE SON A PRINCIPALLY I'M STRUGGLING WITH ISSUES WITH A COUPLE OF JOINTS THAT I KNOW SINCE WILL EVENTUALLY HELP ME REGENERATES IN THE MEANTIME GOOD DIET YOA THE BASIC PILLARS DIET A NOT A A YE NOT A PERFECT DIET BUT BY AN LARGE OVER ALL MY DIETS PRETTY GOOD AM AND THEN O THATHE LITTLE LITTLE THINGS SPIRITUAL KEEPS ME IN SHAPE PHYSICALLY A ITN A COLD PLUNGE AIS IS CHALLENGING PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND PHYSICALLY AND A SULTAO SHIFTER THERE ADS FOR SURE AND YOU DON'T NEED SCIENCE TO KNOW THAT A THREE SECONDS OR A MINUTE IN THAT COLD WATER IS GONG TO CHANGE YOUR CHEMISTRY FOR A LONG WHILE AFTERWARDS AND FOR THE BETTER I BELIEVE YEONCE YOU GET OUT PEOPLE FORGET THAS THEY LIKE I HATE THE COLTHEULT THE POINT IS NOT HOW YOU FEEL WHILE YOU'RE IN IT YOU CAN FEEL PROUD OF HOW YOU NAVIGATE THAT PORTION BUT THE POINT IS HOW YOU FEEL AFTERWARDS WY THE OLD THE OLD SANG WHY DO YOU HEAT YOURSELF IN IT IN THE HAND WHERE THE HAMMER AS IT FEEL SO GOOD WHEN YOU STOP I THAT LIKE THAT A SPOKEN LIKE SOMEBODY WORKED TO NEW YORK CITY FOR A LONG TIME A OUT HERE WE PRISE SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AM HEA A CRYSTALS IN LAVA LAMPS OR SOMETHING ALTHOUG THER ARE MANY LAVE LAMPS ANY MORE I THINK THAT THE IDEA THAT CALIFORNIA IS ALL HIPPY DIPPY THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE ANY MORE I THINK IT'S BEEN OVERRUN BY BY OTHER UM A DIFFERENT YETHELS IN ANY OF THAT AM THANKS FOR SHARING THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE CAN'T SEPARATE THE PHYSICAL FROM THE PSYCHOLOGICAL RIGHT O ME WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE MENTAL AND FATIGUE STATUS OF THE PEOPLE YOU'RE NEGOTIATING WITH OFTENTIMES DURING THIS CONVERSATION BUT THEN OF COURSE THERE'S HOW YOU SHOW UP TO THE JOB IMEAN IF YOU'RE RUN DOWN THREE DAYS AND YOU'VE BEEN IN A FIGHT WITH YOUR SPOUSE AND THAT'S STILL IN THE BACK YOUR MIND AND YOUR AM AN YOUR HUNGRY TIRED SICK WHAT YOU KNOW M NOT CONNECTED TO YOUR HIGHER POWER ALL THAT SINGS THAT THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE AT ANY JOB SO IT IT'S GREAT TO HERE AND NOT SURPRISING TO HEAR THAT YOU HAVE A BEDROCK PRACTICES THAT YOU YOU IMPLEMENT SPHA'S INTERESTING POINT ALMOST EVERYBODY I KNEW T IT WAS REALLY GOOD AND YTHING THEY DID FOR LIVING THEY PROBABLY TOOK PRETTY GOOD CARE F THEMSELVES YEW I AGREE YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS THAT THE LANGUAGE AROUND SELF CARE YET I THINK GET'S REALLY DISTORT IT I'M AN EDITORIALAZE FOR A SECOND O I THINK IT UM BUT I'M AN EDITORIALIZING LINE WITH WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID UM YOU NI THINK SELF CARE SOUNDS LIKE NAVAL GAZING WHERE PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT SELF BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING CARE OF ONESELF SO THAT WE CAN SHOW UP BETTER FOR EVERYBODY ELSE A MORE ENERGY MORE CAPACITY MORE STAING POWER TO HAVE THOSE HART CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE WE CARE ABOUT AND THAT MOVE OUR LIFE FORWARD SO IT'S REALLY REFILLING THE THE FUEL TAK IN MY MIND I SOPPOSED TO UM THE KIND OF A EGOCENTRIC NORSISISTIC YOU KNOW STANDS TAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE TOWARDS THAT THEY AND AND I UNDERSTAND WHYT THEY DO YOU KOW PEOPLE SCROLL THROUGH INSRAM AN THEY SEE UM PEOPLE YOU KNOW SELF BEING EVERY EVERY MUSCLE AND LIKE IN ALL THE SCUFFIN S ANT I'M NOT DISPARAGING WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO BUT BUT THE END OF THE DAY SELF CARE IS ABOUT BEING MORE READY TO DO BETTER FOR THE WORLD IF YOURE OR IF YOUR MISSIONARY ANTO AGREE COMPLETELY AGREE DO YOU THINK THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN THE AM F B I A OVER THE LAST THREE FORTY YEARS AROUND THAT YOU KNOW I HAVE THIS IMAGE IN MY MIND OF AGENTS LIKE SITTING IN CARS FOR TWENTY HOURS EATING HOGY SAND WHICH IS AND UM YOU KNOW AN NOW LOOKING THROUGH BYNOCULARS AND RUNNING THEMSELVES INTO THE GROUND WITH LIKE THIS KIND OF BULL DOG LIKE PERSISTENCE TO TTO SOLVE THE PUZZLE M PUT DIFFERENTLY I IMAGINE THERE ARE SOME NEGOTIATIONS THAT WERE VERY LONG AND FATIGUING SO AM DID YOU RECALL ONE OF THE LONGER NEGOTIATIONS THAT YOU HAD AND HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT MIDWAY THROUGH A HOSTAGE CRISIS UM SO LONG AS ONE THEN I WAS I WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN ON ALMOST THEY TO DAY AND OURD OUR ONE WHEN WHEN ABOUT THREE ISH DAYS MORSINIDS A TWO THOUSAND THREE START OF TH SECOND ARAC WARKIND AN DWY WATS AND ROLL THE TRACT INS THE MED SE AND CLAIM TO ET FOURBOMBS AND LE FOURBOMB SCATTERED AROUND THE CITY HAD HE ACTUALLY DONE THAT ER HE WAS JUST CALMED HE WAS BLUFF HE WAS BLUFFIN HE HE HADN'T DONE EITHER UM ANT START ON SAINT PATRICK'S DANE GONT INTERESTING A COT YONO I LIKE THE LIKE THE THING IN E THAT YOU SAID IN WAS IN OF THE PHILIPPINES SLIKE NATIONAL HOLID AND   HOLIDAY RIHT  INTERESTING A FOR WHOLE BUNCH OF REASONS NOW I AND AN I HAD TO GO HOME GO TO SLEEP A WHEN ONE NIGHT AND WHEN WE AREIN THE MIDDLE OF THAT AND THEN IT WAS JUS I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING TROUBLE GOING TO SLEEP BECAUSE I FELT LIKE A DID A GOOD JOB UM AND AT WE HANDED I HANDED THE SHIFT OFF TO ANOTHER HOSTAGE TOGOTIATE FOR THE BUREAU WAS EFFECTIVELY THE TEAM LEADER VINE STAFFON SO AND VINCE WAS BRINNING NEGOTIATOR SO AND THE TEAM THAT HE WAS WITH I YOU KNOW EVERYBODYW'S IN GOOD HANDS IS MATTERFACT VINCE ALMOST KICKED ME OUT OF T SCENE CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO WHEN HE JUST KEPT HAND GO AND GET SOME SLEEP GO HONE GET SOME SLEEP AND FINALLY THE FIFTH TIME HE SAID AT THE MAN WENT HOME SO I FELT LIKE I WAS LEAVING A THINGS IN REALLY GOOD HANDS AND WE WORK IN KIDNAPPINGS WE EXPECTED THEM TO GO FOR LONG PERIDS HE TIME ANS  JUST CONNAGOT A IT IF YOU HAVE FAITH IN A PROCESS AND YOU FEEL LIKE THAT YOU'RE DOING THE BEST AT CAN BE DONE AND THEN I THINK HE COULD SLEEP AT NIGHT UM I GES TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YOU YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHETHER YOU'RE WORKING A  A CASE O SIEGE OR UM ANYTHING N IN IN THE BUREAU THAT YOU DON'T RUN YOURSELF INTO THE GROUND AND THERE WAS SOME CASES AT WORKE IN A NINETIES WHERE I MEAN LIKE WE WE KNOCKED OURSELVES OUT LIKE WE WOULD WE WORKED HARTEINEBODY WE EVER SAW BUT WE OCCASIONALLY WE TOOK TIME OFF TOO AND I WORKED WITH GUYSE TAT REALIZED THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAD TO GO OUT AND HAVE A BEARD KICK BACK AND BLOSSOME SOME STEAM SO I THINK EVERYBODY THAT I EVER WORKED WITH WE'RE OCCASIONALLY CAUTIOUS ENOUGH TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES AND THEN DEPEND UPON THE NATURE OF THE CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF YOU IRE WAS A SIEGE IN SAINT MARTIN'S PARISH AND WEN SIX DAYS I DON'T THINK THOSE GUYES GOT A LOT OF SLEEP THAT THE NATURE THOSE SIEGES IN THAT PARTICULAR THEPESIEGE ONLY LAST FIVE OR SIX DAYS ANYWAY YOU JUST GOT TO GOT IT OUT WERE THERE EVER INSTANCE HIS WHERE YOU JUST TRY TO KEEP THE PERSON ON THE LINE SO THEY CAN JUST RAD YOU KNOW I I NEVE I NEVER HAD TO DO THAT PERSONALLY YOU HAD TO BE PREPARED TO DO THAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF ANY SIEGE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET SOME OUYOU MIGHT HAVE TO ORCHESTRATE ON ASSAULT OF SOME SORT I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH EARLY ON OF MY TRAINING THERE'S KIND OF A FAMOUS SIEGE IN IF YOU KNOW HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION HISTORY IN LONDON CALLED THE PRINCES GATE SIEGE WHERE UM O ALEGENDARY BRITISH HOSTAGE NEGOTIATED DAVID VENESS HAD THE BAD GUYSES ON A PHONE WHILE THE SA S WAS HIDDEN HIDD THE BUILDING AND REMEMBER THAT WE WERE SHOWN LIKE LOOK THERE MAYB COME A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO KEEP SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE WHEN SWAT COMES AND THAT GOES WITH THE TERRITORY SO EXPECT THAT'S A POSSIBILITY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND IT WAS A GREAT SIEGE UM THE BAD GUY SALENE THE PHOTOES OF HIM AFTER HE WAS SHOT THE PHONE IS WITHIN HIS REACH DAVID KEPT HIM ON THE PHONE I'VE HEARD THE TAPES THE A BREACHING EXPLOSIONS WERE GOING ON AND IL SLIMP SAYS I GOT TO GO I GOT TO GO THEIR SUSPICIOUS NOISES AND DAVID VENIC AND HIS CLASSIC BRITISH ACCENT SAID SALENE THERE ARE NO SUSPICIOUS NOISES NOW LET'S GET BACK TO TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING ON THE BUS TO THE AIR POY BAN AND AND HE WENT IN AND AND I CAUGHT UP WITH DAVID A NUMBER YEARS LATER A HAD  IF PI PRI HAD PRESIDENTIAL INTERN FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IN TURNIL WITH ME IN THE BUREAU WE'RE DRINKING IN A BAR WITH DAVID VANASS I HAD A LOT OF STORIES WHERE I'M DRINKING TO BAR WITH SOMEBODY AND IN TURN WALKED AROUND EVERYBODY AND TAP DAVID ON THE SHOULDER AND HE SAYS A CHRIS SAYS YOU KEPT THE TARASTON A PHONE UP TO THE MOMENT THAT THE ESSAYIS CAME IN A DOOR AND DAVID SAYS YEN I KEPT EM ON THEPHONE EVEN LONGER IF THE ESSAY ISSAID HADN'T COME IN SO SSOON SO WHY MY TELLING THAT STORY IF YOU'E GOING TO GET INTO THAT LINE OF BUSINESS YOU GOT ACCEPT ALL THE THINGS TO GO WITH IT AND REALIZE THAT UM IT'S NOT YOU THAT MADE THE DECISION SOMEBODY ELSE DID YOU GET IMPLEMENT THE STRANEGY DO YOU REMEMBER IT CASE A IN SACRAMENTO WHERE A I THINK IT WAS A YOUTH GANG THEY A TOOK OVER LIKE AN ELECTRONIC STORED GUIS SEECH YET I REMEMBER THIS WHEN I WAS HID AND I TWO THINGS THAT RINK THAT STAND OUT OF MY MIND FROM WHEN I WAS A KID ONE WAS THE UM GOOD G GUYE WAS THE NAME OF THE ELECTRONIC STORE RIGHT GOOD GUISE IS LECTRON STORE AND A BAD GUISE  US SO TO SPEAK WENT IN THERE TOOK THEM HOSTAGE AND UM I MUST BEEN A KID THIS MUST HAVEBEN LIKE LATE AT LES A LATE DATYSA EY  SOMETHING LIKE THAT U I REMEMBER THAT CASE IMS AABOUT NINETEEN NINETY WELATE OR EIGHTY NINE OR NINETY I KNEW ONE OF THE NEGOTIATORS I WAS ACTN SO WAS MORNING SEVENTY FIVE SO UM AND AS I RECALLD THEY ENDED UP OPENING FIRE ON A MUNCH OF HOSTAGES WHO WERE LAYING DOWN ON THE GROUND I'S THAT RIGHT THEY UM THEY THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE GETTING READY TO EXECUTE THE HOSTAGES BECAUSE THEY PUT BAGS OVER THEIR HEADS AND THAT WHENEVER THE BAD GUIDE DO ANY THING TO DEHUMANIZE THE HOSTAGE IT'S EASE YOU TO SHOOT SOMEBODY WITH A BAG OVER THEIR HEAD THEN IT IS NOT  YOU CAN'T SEE THEIR FACE AND SO THE BAD GUISE HAD BEGUN THAT PROCESS AND THEY KNEW THEY NEEDED TO ASSAULT GOD FORBID ANY ONE SHOULD EVER BE TAKEN HOSTAGE I REALIZE CIRCUMSTANCES S DIFFER BUT YOU JUST MENTION PUTTING BAGS OVER THEIR HEADS THERE'S THIS NOTION OF SHEEPLE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL DESCRIBE AM POST TALK AFTER SOMETHING ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WALKS INTO A BUILDING TELLS PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW PUT ZIP TIES ON THEIR OWN ANKLES WHO ARE GOING TO A BACK ROOM THAT NOBODY RESISTS AND THAT IN RATROSPECT HAD SOMEBODY CAUSE A COMMOTION THEY MIGHT HAVE CAUSED ENOUGH OF A COMMOTION TO EITHER RUN OUT OR BE LET GO AM AND YET OF COURSE THERE'S A VERY LOGICAL PART OF EVERYBODY'S BRAIN I WOULD HOPE THE THINGS LISTEN THIS PERSON IS AN AGGRESSOR THERE'S A GUN IN MY FACE DON'T BE AN IDIOT RIGHT CAUSE IT I WE ALSO HAVE HEARD OF THE CASE IN NEW YORK CITY THAT READ ABOUT THIS IN THE NEWSPAPER SO PRESUMABLY IT'S TRUE A WARE SOME ONE WAS HELD UP A GUN POINT IN ONE OF THE WOMEN IN THE GROUP THAT WAS HELD UP SOWHODY CAN DO SHOOT US AND THE PERSON SHOT  RANGS OUT THAT HAPPENS TO SO YOU KNOW IM I DON'T KOW IF THERE'S IT A FAIR AND SAFE ANSWER TO GIVE PEOPLE ON THIS BUT IF YOU'RE TOLD TO DO SOMETHING BY SOMEBODY AND IT'S T ALL HAPPENING IN REAL TIME I MEAN YOU HAVE THAT ASK DO THEY WANT MY MONEY N MY BODY MY LIFE OR SOME COMMINATION OF THE THREE IN REAL TIME WHILE UNDER PRESUMABLY SIGNIFICANT DO REST IM BUT FOR HOSTAGES BUK IF THEY IF THEY DISOBEY CAUSE A COMMOTION IS THAT EXTENDING THEIR LIFE OR IS IT SHORTENING THEIR LIFE I GUESS IT IT'S VERY CONTEXT DEPENDENT T O THE ONLY THING THAT I COAN WITHOUT KNOWING THE CONTET ANYTHING YOU COULD DO TO HUMANIZE YOURSELF AND COMPLY WITH WHAT THE BAD AS WANT I INCREASES YOU CHANCE OF SURVIVAL SO LET'S SEE GAT ORDER TO GO IN A BACK ROOM YOU COULD LOOK AT THE HOSTAGE TAKER AND SAY I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU SAY I'M CRUSS YOU DON'T DROP YOUR NAME ON THEM IN A WAY SO THAT YOU GO FROM BEING A FACELESS PERSON TO SOMEBODY WITH THE NAME THAT INCREASES A CHANCES TO SURVIVAL HUMANIZATION WHATEVER YOU CAN DO TO C PLY SIMULTANEOUSLY BECOME MORE OF A HUMAN BEING BECAUSE IT'S THE OPSETTLE WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT BEFORE IF YOU'RE EASIER TO KILL IF YOU'VE BEEN DEHUMANIZED YOURE HARDER TO KILL IF YOU'VE BEEN HUMANIZED YOU'RE HARDER A HARM LIKE MAY BE THEN I CAN TO KILL YOU THEYE JUST GOIN THEY'RE JUST GONE TO HART YOU THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HARM YOU IF THEY KNOW YOUR FIRST NAME HOW DO YOU GET TIS A HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR IF THEY IF THEY TALK ABOUT A HOSTAGE I I'LL SAY YYOU KNOW YOU MEAN YOU MEAN SHEELER DYOU MEAN RAXS GAN I I'M I'LL FIND A WAY TO DROP THE PERSON'S NAME INTO THE CONVERSATION SO SOON AS IF IF YOU CAN HUMANIZE JUST BY GIVING THEM TO KNOW YOUR NAME YOU INCREASE THE CHANCES OF SURVIVABILITY INCREASE THE CHANCES OF BEING TREATED BETTER IT AN'D COMPLY I'LL DO WHAT BUT I'LL DO WHAT EVERY SAMPCRESS I'S GOING IS GOING TO START TE MOVE THE OUTS IN YOUR FAVOR YOU KNOW T AT WHAT YOU DESCRIPT DESCRIBED EXTENDS TO A SCIENCE IM YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT MY STANDS ON ANIMAL RECEARCH AND A WHY I CHOOSE TO NO LONGER DO IT I I DO THINK IT HAS ITS PLACE IN MAKING IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES THAT CANNOT BE MADE ON HUMANS BUT THAT EVENTUALL EXTEND TO BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT I DON'T WANT TO PERSON I DON'T WANT DO IT AND I DON'T WANT TO PRIMATE WORK OR LARGE CARNIVOR WORK OR SMALL CARNIVORE WORK BUT ON THE POINT I WAS GOING TO MAKE IS THAT WHEN YOU DO PRIMATE WORK IM THEY STRONGLY DISCOURAGE YOUR FORBID YOU FROM GIVING THEM NAMES FRANG GEVE NUMBERS RIGHT RIHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT SO IT'S T IT ALL FALLS IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU ERE WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT CAUSE THE MOMENT SOMETHING HAS A NAME IT MOVES FROM BEING A RESEARCH ANIMAL TO A PET OF SORTS AND THAT MAKES IT A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT SO INTERESTING HOW A NAME TURN SOMETHING FROM A YOU KOW IT ELEVATE SOMETHING TO A RELATIONSHIP HOWEVER INSIGNIFICANT IT IT'S UP A NOTCH AND INTO OUR EMPATHY CIRCUITRY DH WHICH IS A PERHAPS THEY APPROPRIATE SEGWAY TO TALK ABOUT AMPATHY THIS IS A TOPIC THAT A YOU SPANLYA LAS  YEU YOU A YOU MENTION TACTICAL AMPATHY RIGHT OCUMENT HOU BY THE WAY WHEN IS THAT GOING TO BE OUT OR DO WE HAVE SOME SENSE MY GUESS IS A WE'LL FINISH JUMP AN THROUG ALL THE HOOPS AND PROBABLY HAVE OUT AT THE BEGINNING NEXT YEAR WERE A I'MCURRENTLY WORKING WITH LN MORSE EN DEAVOR ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS THEY'VE BEEN ENORMOUSLY SUPPORT OF AND WE'VE ASKED FOR THEIR GUIDANCE ON HOW TO HAW TO THE BEST TIME TO GET THE DOCTORMENTARY OUT AND VERY HAPPY WITH THE PEOPLE ON DEALING WITH THEIR AND ACTUALLY STROKE OF TE UNIVERSE WAS LOOKING OUT FORME FUNNY SAT O CIRCUMSTANCES AND JUST REALLY ENJOY WITH THE PEOPLE ONN WORKING WITH THEIR SO PROBABLY FIRST PARTOF NEXT YEAR FANTASTIC WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON EMPATHY I THINK OF EMPATHY AND THE POP CULTURE SENSE OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S FEELING PAIN AND WE FEEL THEIR PAIN BUT OF COURSE EMPATHY EXTENDS WAY BEYOND THAT YE YE YE AND THAT WASEM A RRAMALANKA YE MY YOU OLLI GET STAMFORD YES I WAS I AS REALLY FASTENING BY THE CONVERSATION A YOU YOU HAD WITH HIM ON THAT RECENTLY AND SO N HE SEID A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU YMPATHY A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS SORT OF FOR THEIR OWN MEANINGS SO UM MY TAKE ON EMPATHY TACTICAL EMPATHY ALSO TO KEEP TRON NAMES OUT BECAUSE PEOPLE GIVE ME THOUGHTS AND I'M ONE A SORCE AMOUNT IAN I'M VERY CLOSE TO STEPHEN COLLERS PROSPECTIVE ON IT STEPHENO SAY EMPATHY IS ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION COMPASSION IS REACTION TO THE TRANSMISSION I LIKE THAT AND BY THE WAY I'M AFAND OF STEPHEN'S WORK I THINK HE I THINK HE'S QUITE A STUT AND A BOY IS HE A HARD WORK HE WRITES LIKE A BEAST I GANLY HELP IT LIKE FOR IN THE MORNING ELS HAS LIKE FIFTY CHAWA WAS OR SOMETHING CRATE BAT HE'S AWAYIN THE DOORS YE ANN ARLY T WILL IUM FIT MORE CHAAAS IN HE ROOM THEN OTHERS GOT YA STEPHEN EY AS SO A AND AND THAT WAS WHEN I WAS WITH TH P I WAS STARTED COLLABORATING WITH HARVARD BECAUSE THE HARVARD DEFINITION OM WAS EMPATHY WAS NOT LIKING THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS JUS DEMONSTRATING AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR PERSPECTIVE A BOBMANUCAN'S BOOK BEYOND WINNINGS CHAPTER THE ATTENTION BETWEEN EMPATHY AND ASSERTIVNESS HE SAYS H EMPATHY IS NOT AGREEING DISAGREEING OR EVEN LIKING THE OTHER SIDE WHICH SORT OF FALLS INTO WHAT STEPHENG TALKED ABOUT UN IT'S ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION NOW IMPATHY IS VERY COMPASSIONATE THING TO DO BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY EQUATE TO COMPASSION ITSELF IF I'M IMIF I IF I LET YOUIF I MAKE YOU FEEL HEARD BY ME SAYING TO YOU WHAT YOU'RE PERSPECTIVE ON SOMETHING IS YOU GAN TO FEEL CARED FOR YOU CAN A FEEL UNDERSTOOD IT'S GON A LAND WITH YOU REALLY WELL I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO FEEL COMPASSION FOR YOU I KNOW IT'S A PRECURSOR TO COMPASSION SO I WOULD SEPARATE IT FROM SYMPATHY CLEARLY AND I WOULD EVEN SYMPATH SEPARATE IT FROM COMPASSION ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT'S A VERY COMPASSIONATE THING TO DO IT'S ABOUT TACTICAL EMPATHY IS ABOUT ME ACTIVELY DEMONSTRATING VERBALLY TO YOU THAT I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM TACTIC FROM THE EXPERIENCE HAN HOSSES NEGOTIATORS BACT UP BY NOR SCIENCE IS HIT PEOPLE LARGELY REACT NEGATIVELY SO THE SMARTER MOVE FOR ME INSTEAD OFE TRYING TO REINFORCE A POSITIVE IS THE FIRST DEACTIVATE THE NEGATIVE BY SYMPLY CALLING IT OUT CALLING THE ELEPHANT A ROOM OUT DON'T DENY THE ELEPHANT DON'T IGNORE THE ELEPHANT CALL THE ELEPHANT A ROOM OUT SAY IT PROBABLY GAN A SIN LIKE I'M GREEDY IF I EXPECT THAT YOU'RE GOIN TO THINK I'M OVER REACHING AND I CAN SAY I WANT YOU TO THINK I'M GREEDY N I SAY IS PROBABLY IN A SCENE GREEDY SO SIMPLY WELL EDUC ATED EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE INFLUENCE GOT INSTINCT INFLUENCE ON WHAT THE OTHER SIDE IS THINKING AND FEELING IF I CAN DEFINE IT IN THAT WAY THEN IT BECOMES AN UNLIMITED SKILL IF IT REQUIRES ME FOR TO HAVE COMPASSION FOR YOU WHEN I DON'T THEN THAT LIMITS MY ABILITY TO USE YMPATHY AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING THAT ABILITY TO BE LIMITED I WANTED TO BE AN UNLIMITED SKILL SO IF YOU JUST IF YOU DISDEFINE IT STRICTLY IN TERMS OF TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION THEN IT'S NOT SYMPATHY YOUR COMPASSION OR LIKING OR GREEN IT HAS A VERY POWERFUL EFFECT IT AT LEAST FEELS LIKE COMPASSION TO THE OTHER SIDE IT REACTS WITH THE EMOTIONAL CIRCUITORY THE NERRO CHEMICALS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO SOME DEGREE IF THEY'RE ALIVE EVEN IF THERE ON THIS THE SPECTRUM THEY HAVE SOME OF THAT GOING ON INSIDE AND OF WHAT I'VE READ UNEVEN EVEN A MENTAL ILLNESSES A IN MY LAST CENTURY TRAINING I SAW PEOPLE WHO RE PARONOITS GETS APHENIC IS A EFFECTIVELY BE MORE OF A WIRING PROBLEM TAN A CHEMICAL PROBLEM FOR FOR A LAYMAN'S DESCRIPTION AND A LOT OF WHAT I'VE READ SAID EMPATHIES EVEN EFFECTIVE WITH PARNOITS GETS APHENICS PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF HOW DISARRAY THE CIRCUITRY IN THEIR HEAD IS IT'S A IT HELPS THEM ON SOME LEVEL TO FEEL UNDERSTOOD SO EMPATHY IS JUST ABOUT MANING SOMEBODY FEEL UNDERSTOOD EXAMPLE WHEN I'M I'M WORKCIN TERRISM WE HAD A LOT OF ARAB MUSLIMS TESTIFY AN OPEN CIVILIAN CHORD AGAINST A A LEGITIIMATE MUSLIN CLERIC WHO WAS ALSO A CRIMINAL WO ALSO COMMITTED CRIMES AND I WOULD SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND I'D SAY TOM RUN OFF THE BAT CAUSE I KNOW WHERE THEY COMING FROM YOU BELIEVE THAT THEREH'S BEEN A SUCCESSION OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN ANTIZE LOMINE AND THEYD LOOK AT ME IN A GO LIKE Y I NEVER SAID I IT WAS TRUE I NEVER SAT IR GREED I NEVER SAID I DISAGREED BY ME SIMPLY ARTICULATING WITH THEIR PRESPECTIVE ON THE INTER ACTION WAS THEY WERE SO STARTLED BY IT IT WAS YMPATHY AND AND AV WE WERE SO GOOD AT THAT IMPATHY FREQUENTLY IN AT IN THAT TIME FRAME THEY WOULD SAY ARE YOU ARE YOU MUSLEM AND ITSI KNOW I RESPECT A RELIGION YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED TO KNOW AT I'M A CHRISTIAN BUT I RESPECT YOUR RELIGION AND I I GOT NO PROBLEM SAYING TO YOU WHERE YOUARE COMING FROM THAT'S YMPATHY FROM MY DEFINITION AND THEN IT BECOMES AN UNLIMITED SKILL I I DON'T HAVE TO FEEL IT I DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY ONE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW GOMAN SAYS THERE'S COGNETE OF AMPATHY ME JUST RECOGNIZING WHAT YOUR EMOTIONS ARE COMING FROM THERE'S EMOTIONAL AMPATHY ME FEELING YOUR EMOTIONS AND THERE'S EMPATHIC CONCERN ME WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR DISTRESS MY VERSION OF TACTICAL MPATHY PROBABLY BRINGS THOSE INTO PLAY AND SEEK WHENCE ON A CONTINUUM OF SORTS BUT NONE OF THEM ARE PRECURSORS IT JUST ME SHOWING TO YOU THAT I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU COMING FROM AND IT HAS A PHENOMENANLLY FAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE INTERACTION TELL ME ABOUT MIRRORING AS A TOOL YET MIRRORING IS A ONE OF THE SIMPLEST EASIEST O AND MOST EFFECTIVE OF THE SKILL TAT TAKES THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BRAN POWER IT JUST REPEATING ONE TO THREEISH WORDS OF WHAT SOMEBODY 'S JUST SAID A CAN BE ONE IT YOU SHOULD NEVER USUALLY BE MORE THAN FIVE HOSTAGE EGOTIATOERS LEARNIT BY REPEATING THE LAST ONE O THREE WORDS OF SOMEBODY'S JUST SAID IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE LAST ONE O THREE WORDS AND A MIRRORING IS NOT THE BODY LANGUAGE MERITS NOT MIMIKING ANYBODY PHYSICALLY AND IT'S NOT MIMICKING THEIR TONE OF VOICE OR THEIR AFFACT OR ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT'S JUST REPEATING ONE O THREE ISH WORDS WE FOUND THAT ACCESSES FOR WHATEVER PART OF BRAIN YOU A THAT YOU GOT ENERGIZE TO DO IT IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT PART OF THE BRAIN THAN LABELING PEOPLE ARE USUALLY THE GOOD REALY GOOD LABELING LIKE II LABEL IMUST EVERYON MY TEAM LABELS A LOT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS BO THAN YOU SOUNDS LIKE SEEMS LIKE YOU JUST NOT REDY SURE WORE THIS IS GOON AND THE MIRROR I GET A CONSCIOUSLY MAKE IT A POINT TO MIRROR AND WHAT'S A MIRROR USE FOR IT'S IN PLACE OF WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT OR WOULD YOU PLEASE GO ON OR I DON'T UNDERSTAND COULD YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN SO I'LL LISTEN FOR STUFF THAT EITHER I DON'T UNDERSTAND OR I NEED YOU TO TALK MORE ABOUT AND INSTEAD OF SAYING COULD YOU SAY SOME MORE ABOUT THAT I'LL JUST MIRROR OF THE WORDS NOW FOR WHATEVER REASON IT CONNECTS THE THOUGHTS IN YOUR HAT THE MESSAGE THE WAY THAT LANDS IS I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID THE WORDS I GOT THE WORDS CAUSE I JUST REPEATED IM AND I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND SO I NEED A MORE INDEPT EXPLANATION WITHOUT USING THE SAME WORDS THAT YOU JISUSED BECAUSE OF YOU SAY UM I THINK ACTUAL PRASS ACTUAL PRASS IS EM IS USELESS AND I MIGHT SAY WOULD YOU MEAN BY THAT AND YOU GO I SO PRACTIVS THEM IS USELESS YOU REPEAT THE SAME WORDS ONLY LOTTER YOU FIGURE THAT SAYING AT LATTER WILL MAKE IT PENETRATE MY CRANIUM THAT DOES A WORK I NEED YOU TO READ TO EXPLAIN TO GO INTO MORE ADAPTH TO EXPAND USING DIFFERENT WORDS AND FOR WHATEVER REASON WE FOUND AS HOSTES NEGOTIATORS AND I FIND I BUSINESS THAT IF I MIRROR YOU YOU'LL EXPAND AND YOU'L CONNECT SO IT'S IF I USE IT IN THAT CONTEXT I MIGHT USE IT TO GET YOU TO HEAR YOURSELF OUT LOUD LIKE IFF WHAT YOU JUST SAID DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I'LL REPEAT IT BACK WORD FOR WORD WEN TO THREE WORDS AND ALL UPWARD AND FLECT I'LL SAY THAT IT DOESN'T MEXCENSE OUKNO USE USE MY TONE MAKE AT LAND WITH MY TONES YOU CAN HEAR YOURSELF OUT LOUD SOMEBODY ELSE JUST POINTED OUT TO ME THE OTHER DAY THAT IF YOU TALKING TO SOMEBODY AND THEY'RE IN MID THOUGHT AND THE KIND OF THEIR VOICE TRAILS OFF BECAUSE THEY SORT OF LOST THEIR TRAIN OF THOUGHT IF YOU MIRROR THEM THERE THAT HELPS THEM GET THEIR TRAIN OF THOUGHT BACK AND EXPAND SO WIT'S IT'S A RIDICULOUSLY EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION TOOL TO GET PEOPLE TO EXPAND AND FEEL HEARD IT'S SIMPLICITY PUT SOME PEOPLE OFF THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT SAY I ANS ONT STUPEN O ONC SEE WHAT GOOD THAT WILL DO I ALWAYS NOTICE IF SOMEBODY'S REALLY WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT MIRRORING MY DESCRIPTION IS THARE BOTH HIGH IYE CU AND HI EQE YOU AND WHY DOES THAT WORK A HI EYE YOU GUYSE ON O WANTE NOR SOMETHING THIT'S REALLY SIMPLE THAT DOESN'T TAKE ANY EFFORT TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT A MIRROR DOES IT'S REALLY REALLY EFFECTIVE IT'S ALMOST NO EFFORT ON YOUR PART AT ALL INTERESTIN I MUST SAY THAT NARROW SCIENCE HAS A UM AN UNFORTUNATE DIRTH OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW BRAINS INTERACT THIS IS STARTING TO CHANGE BUT MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW BRAIN'S WORK IS FROM PUTTING PEOPLE INTO FUNCTIONAL MAGNET AC PRESENCE IN MAGING MACHINES ILL CALL THEM OR I I'M EXPOSING THEM TO MOVE EASE OR GAMES THAT THEY HAVE TO PLAY ET CETERA AND THEN LOOKING AT BRAINSTATED ACTIVATION THERE ARE A FEW LABORATORY STARTING TO LOOK AT HOW PEOPLE INTERACT IN REAL TIME WITH BOTH PEOPLE IN SEPARATE EM ORI MACHINES THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO PAR R SOME OF THIS AND IM I'M CERTAIN THAT SOMEBODY HEARING THIS WILL IM USE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO GO DO THE EXPERIMENT IF NOT AL ALA RUN UP THE FLAGPULD O SOM A HIGHLY QUALIFIED PEOPLE AT STANFORD WHO COULD WHO COULD DO THIS BECAUSE BE FUN TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT HAVE THE SENSE THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THERE IS A REAL MERGE OF COGNITION WHEN ONE HEAR'S THEIR OWN WORDS  SPOKEN BACK TO LEARN THAT AM WAT'S AT YOU KNOW YOU GEN NOW GOT TWO BRAINS PROCESSING THE SAME INFORMATION AND THAT HAS TO LEAD NEW PLACES SO A I DON'T HAVE ANY AM ON INSIGHT AS TO WHERE WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING BUT A CERTAINLY THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THERE EVIDENCE BY THE REAL WORLD RESULTS THAT YOU'RE GETTIN WE DON'T ADAL SERMENTS TO TELL US THAT A AT TO BE INTERESTING TO TO SEE AND LEARN A BIT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IF THERE'S A FUSION FOR INSTANCE OF A COACTIVATION OF EMOTIONAL CENTERS COACTIVATION OF UM RE THERE'S SOMETHING BOUT HEARING OUR OWN VOICE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THEN HEARING OTHER PEOPLE'S VOICES MOST PEOPLE CRINGE WHEN THEY HEAR THEIR OWN VOICE ON RECORDING AM MOST NOT ALL AM SOME PEOPLE ARE IN LOVE WITH THEIR OWN VOICE A I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE BUT WE KNOW THAT OUR AUDITORY SYSTEM CANCELS OUT THE HEARING OF OUR OWN VOICE DID YOU KNOW THAT AS WE'RE TALKING NOW OUR AUDITORY SYSTEM IS SUPPRESSING OUR OWN VOICE WE DON'T REALLY HEAR OURSELVES SPEAK THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK I HEAR YOU SPEAK YET SO A IT'S AN ACTIVE NOR A CHEMICAL INHIBITION OF THE RESPONSE AND IT'S AMAZING TOO BECAUSE AS WE GROW UP OUR VOICE CHANGES PURITY AND SO FORTH TAND OTHER WAYS TOO THAT THE VOCAL COURSE CHANGE IN THICKNESS ET CETERA AND OUR VOICE CHANGES BUT WE ALWAYS KNOW SELF FROM OTHER IN TERMS OF VOICE AND WE CANCEL OUT OUR ACTUAL AUDITORY PERCEPTION OF OUR OWN THAT'S FASCINATING AND BREATHING AND HEART BEAT WE SHUT DOWN OUR RESPONSE TO SELF ACTIVELY WITHIN THE BRAIN HAT'S FASCINATING SO MAYBE HEARING BACK SOME OF WHAT WE JUST SAID ALLOWS US TO ACTUALLY HEAR WHAT WE E JUST SET YE WHAT TRUE AN A ASKED WHY PEOPLE YOUSOMETIMES ALL SOMEBODY NEEDS A SOUNDING BOR SO THEY CAN THEY CAN SOMEBODY ELSE CAN HEAR HEAR THEY CAN HEAR THEMSELVES OUT AND GET A REPEATED BACK TO IM AND AN TE GO LIKE WAY MEN DIDN I JUST SAY THAT E INTERETING INTERESTING USEFUL INDEED PRO ACTIVE LISTENING TELL US ABOUT PROACTIVE LISTENING WE'RE ALL TOLD THAT WE NEED TO BE BETTER LISTENERS YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY SO ONE THAT WE GOT TWO EARS IN ONE MOUTH AS IF THAT'S WLEFT TO REMIND US A MUST PEL OF TWO EARS IN ONE MOUTH AM BUT I GET THE POINT THEY WERE SAYING HEY THERE'S VALUE IN LISTENING AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WE DEFAULT TO BROADCAST BUT NO RECEPTION WE'RE MOSTLY BROADCAST LESS RECEPTION AM HENCE THE A TO CALL FOR NASAL BREATHING IT'S USEFUL IN A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES A CAUSE IT KEEPS US IT GIVES OUR MOUTH SHUT A WHAT IS PROACTIVE LISTENING HOW DO WE DO IT WELL THY WHAT'S IT GOUD I'M REALLY TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE NOTION OF ACTIVE LISTENING JUST BECAUSE ACTIVE LISTENING HAS BEEN SO OVERUSED A PEOPLE OF LOST TRACK OF IT AND A MOST OF UTS TAUGHT POORLY AND IT'S INTERACTIVE FOR ITS PROACTIVE AND SO WE LEARN TO HOSTAGE NEGOTIATORS FIRST OF ALL JUST A LABEL TO PRESENTING EMOTION AND WE JUST ASSUME THAT IN T PRESENTING EMOTION WAS ALWAYS ANGER OF SOME FORM ANGER UPSET ON CERTAIN RERINSTANCES TAGI WAS UNDER CONTROL BUT THEY WERE ALMOST ALWAYS NEGATIVE EMOTION SO WE JUST ASSUME THAT IT WAS ADEFINED TO WHAT WAS A CONFINED TO WHAT WAS DRIVING HOSSAGETAKERS WAS NEGATIVITY NOW IF I MAY AS I I FEEL LIKE AN AN IMPOSTOR TALKING ABOUT NORG SCIENCE TO YOU YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF NOR SCIENCES IS IS SPOT ON AVOS I MUST SAY NUMEROUS TIMES YOU YOU'VE ASKED ME ABOUT THINGS IN NURSIENCE IN YOU YOU'VE NEVER BEEN OFF THE MARK SO YE  YEA YOU YOU AT YOU CLEARLY DONE YOUR HOMEWORK KNO WE KEEP TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT T BUT A WLAYMON'S TERMINOLOGY THE SURVIVAL BRAIN IS LARGELY NEGATIVE BALLPARK I WOULD SAY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT NEGATIVE YOUR REACTIONS ARE GING TO BE NEGATIVE SO NUMBER ONE I BELIEVE THAT'S PRINCIPALLY BACKED UP BY THE EXPERIMENTS OF NORL SCIENCE THE F M OUR EYES IF IF IF YOU'S ALLUDED TO AND SO THEN AN HOSTISE NEGOTIATION WE RE TAUGHT TO BASICALLY LABEL TO PRESENT THE EMOTION AND THEN I'V SEEN FROM EXPERIMENTATION A REPORTING OF EXPERIMENTS UM I THINK THAT FIRST TIME I READ ABOUT IT WAS IN A BOOK CALLED THE UPWARD SPIRAL AND THAT BOOK IS A GOOD TEN YEARS OLD I THINK WHICH MEANS YOU KNOW THE NORL SCIENCE IS EVOLVING BUT PRIMARILY THE EXPERIMENT THERE THAT REMEMBER READING ABOUT AND READ ABOUT INOTHER PLACES THAT IF PEOPLE WERE OF UNDERGOING OF A NEGATIVE EMOTION IN MY A LAYMON'S PARAPHRASE OF THE EXPERIMENT IS A THERE SHOWN A PICTURE THAT INDUCED THE NEGATIVE EMOTION IN THEIR HEAD AND THEN THE ASKED PEOPLE TO SIMPLY CALL OUT WHAT THE EMOTION WAS AND WHEN THEY SELF LABELED THEN THE EMOTION DIMINISHED NOW THE DEGREE OF DIMINISHMENT VARIES BUT THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME THAT IT DIMINISHES BY SIMPLY BY CALLING IT OUT IIS JUST DAR NEAR ALL THE TIME SO FOR LARGELY SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT NEGATIVE AND WE CAN DEACTIBATE THE NEGATIVITY BY CALLING IT OUT WELL LET'S BE PROACTIVE IF YOU'RE HUMAN BEING AND WERE ENGAGEMENT IN A NEGOTIATION THERE'S GOING TO BE CERTAIN VERY PREDICTABLE NEGATIVITY THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE AND I SHOULD BE PRACTIVE IN CALLING IT OUT ANTICIPATING THE NEGATIVITY'S GOIN TO BE THERE BASED ON A CIRCUMSTANCES HIGHLY PREDICTABLE AND YOU GOT INSTINCT BEFORE YU REFERRING TO WHEN YOU WANT TO SAY LOOK I DON'T WANT YOU THINK IM BEING GREEDY YOU GOTS TELLING YOU IT'S HIGHLY PREDICTABLE YOU GON T COME OFF IS GREEDY SO LET ME BE PRACTIVE AND SAY IT' PROBABLY IN TO SEEM LIKE IM BEING GREEDY AND THAT'S THE DILING OVER TO WHAT IS EMINENTLY PREDICTABLE IN THE IN IRRACTION AND JUST BEING PORACTIVE TO DEACTIBATE THE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS THAT EITHER ARE TAKING PLACE OR WHAT ARE EXPERIENCE IS FOUND THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SCIENCE THAT IS YET THAT HAS HAT THE OPPORTUNITY THE BACK THITS UP AT INOCULATES I CAN CREATE A BARRIER IF I CALL OUT A NEGATIVE THATT'S NOT THERE DOESN'T PLANT IT IT ACTUALLY INOCULATES YOU FROM IT IF AND I DONE THIS IMPRACTISE I'V I WAS AT GIVEN A LECTURE COUPLE O YEARS AGO ANYBODY ASKD A QUESTION I TRY TO FIND THE VALUE IN THE QUESTION NO MATTER HOW BAD THE QUESTION IS THIS POOR GOD ASKED ME A QUESTION THAT I JUST CANNOT FIND A SINGLE COMPONENT IN HIS QUESTION THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT HE WAS LISTENING OR PAYING ATTENTION THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT I CAN CONGRATULATE HIM ON AND SO I SAID THIS GOING TO SOUND HARSH BECAUSE I KNOW THE ANSWER I'M GETTING READY TO GIVE HIM IS GOING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE TO THE GROUP THAT I THINK HE STUPID I JUST I CAN'T THINK OF A WAY TO RESPOND TO THIS WITHOUT SAYING EFFECTIVELY LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINKON ABOUT THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WHAT WORTH ALKING ABOUT S  GO THIS IS GOING TO SOUND HARSH AND I ANSWER THE QUESTION AND HIS KIND OT GOES OLD KAY AND I START ANSWERING SOMEBODY ELSE QUESTION AND HE GOES THAT WASN'T HARSH NOW IF I HADN'T SAID THIS IS GOING TO SOUND HARSH AND ANSWERED THE QUESTION I GUARANTEE YOU MY ANSWER WOULD HAVE EMBARRASS HIM AND EMBARRASSMENT IS ONE OF THE WORST NEGATIVE EMOTIONS YOU CAN INFLICT ON ANYBODY AND HE WOULD HATE ME TO THIS DAY FOR EMBARRASSIN HIM SO I GOT A MOMENT COMING AT ME THAT IS PREDICTIBLY NEGATIVE AND I CAN LET IT I CAN LET THAT TRAIN RUN ME DOWN OR I CAN CALL OUT OUT IN ADVANCE AND GET A REACTION WERE THE GUISES I WASN'T IT BED AND THAT'S WOULD BE IMPROACT OF ABOUT THE EMOTIONS IS ABOUT I LOVE IT AND I'M RECALLING AN INSTANCE TURN GRADUATE SCOR MY GRADUATE ADVISE HER WHO SADLY AS PASSED AWAY BUT WAS A PHENOMENAL SCIENTIST I'MIN JUST SO PURE  INSISTED ON GETTING THE ANSWERS COULD EMOTIONALLY DETACH FROM THE ANSWERS WHE SHE'S JUST WAS IT WAS A NINGIA SHE USED TO COME INTO THE LABORATORY WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON A PAPER AND SHE'D SIT DOWN AND SHE'D SAY YOU'RE GING TO HATE ME FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO ASK YOU TO DO AND I THINK OH NO LIKE COME T HAVE TO REDO ALL THE ANALYSIS OR I W I LIKE SOME YOU'NA MONUMENTAL THING AND THEN SHE'D SAID YOU GOT A CHANGE THE LIKE FAUNTS IND FIGURE TOO IM I LIKE GODLY WHEN YOU MEAN ONT ATE YOU BUT ITBUT WAS RELIEF I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO MAKE HER HAPPY WITH MY WORK BECAUSE I I RESPECTED THE STANDARD THAT SHE HELD SO SO GREATLY I ME SHE COULD HAVE ASKED ME TO OUNO STAND ON MY HEAD AND DO DO THE EXPERIMENTS FIFTY TIMES I WOULD PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF I THOUGHT THEY WOULD MAKE THE PROJECT BETTER AND AS A CONSEQUENT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASED I BECAUSE SHE WAS THE STANDARD FOR ME AND A MANY WAY STILL IS BUT I'M WONDER IF SHE READ YOUR BOOK BECAUSE I SHE'S TO PRESAGE THESE I'M REQUEST WE LIKE YOU'REGING TO HATE ME AND THEN SHE'D ASKED ME FOR SOME LE NOW I HATE YOU LIKE THAT'S NOTHING BUT NOW I I WONDER IF IIF I WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN ABACK IF SHE HAD JUST SAID I YOU KNOW I' HAY BY THE WAY FIGURE TOO NEEDS REDOING I MIGHT HAVE BEEN KIND OF BRISTLE BY THAT SO 'M MAYBE SHE READ YOUR BOOK THESE ARE GREAT TOOLS MIRRORING AND PRACT OF LISTENING TAN THANK YOU FOR SURING THESE COURSE DID YOU EVER EMPLOY THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF KIDNAPPERS FRIENDS OF KIDNAPPERS AS A MEANS TO I'M TAP INTO A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THEIR PSYCHE YOU BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE ARE ALL AS HUMAN BEINGS VERY CONTEXT RI IN SO I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE PERSON WHO KIDN AP SOMEBODY OR WHOS AM TRYING TO STEAL SOMEBODY'S RESOURCES IS IN A PARTICULAR GROOVE OF T A PERSON AND AND I I DO THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO ARE JUST EVIL BUT I ALSO KNOW BECAUSE I'VE READ ABOUT IT AND I TRUST THE SOURCES THAT THEIR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE HARANDOUS THINGS WHO LOVE THEIR DOG UM AND GENUINELY LOVE THEIR DOG AND WOULDN'T HARM AN ANIMAL BUT I'M NOT TRYING TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE A PASS BUT I COULD IMAGIN THAT I' THOSE OTHER FASCETS TO SOMEBODY REPRESENT REALLY GOOD ENTRY POINTS FOR ALLOWING THEM TO SEE THE KIND OF INCONGRUENTS IN THEIR BEHAVIOR I'M OR IS IT THE CASE THAT WHEN THESE ARE HIGH STRETSED SITUATIONS THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO PASICALLY NOEFTIC ATTACK THE YOU DON'T DISARM THE AGGRESSOR AND YOU'RE JUST FOXING ON THE PERSON AS THE BAD ACTOR NOT CONSIDERING THE OTHER CONTECTS OF THEIR LIVES ID SO LET LIS DRAW DISTINCTION BETWEEN A HOSTAGE TAKERS IN A CONAINED SITUATION AND UM KIDNAPPERS UNCONTAINED UNON LOCATION SO YOU PROBABLY ASKING ABOUT SOMEBODY IN A CONTAINED SITUATION A BADGAS IN A BANK D WHY WATSON IN IN HIS TRACTOR IN WASHINGTON D S SO VERY CONTRENTUTIVELY IF THEREN A CONTAINED SITUATION THERE'S U SAYING OUT THIS IS SYSTEM THAT YOUR EMPLOYING IS PERFECTLY DESIGNED TO GIVE YOU THE OUTCOME THAT YOU HAVE SO BADGUY D WHY WATSON IS ON IS TRACTOR AND D SIE THE FAMILY'S PART OF THE SYSTEM THO PUT HIM THERE THE BLUNT HARSH REALITY OF THAT IS NOW AT THAT SIEGE THAT WENT ON LONG ENOUGH AND WAS SO HIGH PROFILE SOME OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS SHOWED UP NOW WE CAN WE COULD AND AND DID TRY TO USE THEM I'M WALKING I'M WALKING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER FROM THE NEGOTIATION OPERATION A SULL COMPONENT ON A WAY TO COMMAND POST HOSSAS NEGOTIATEO STOPS ME A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WITH HEM IT'S WATSON'S FAMILY AND THEY SEE I'M IN A HURRY AND THEN I'M NOT INTERESTED OT BEIN STOPPED ANDTHEY GOT TO SAY TO ME SOMETHING TO STOP ME AND GET MY OM TETTENTION AND THEY GO LOOK OUR BROTHERS JUST HURT IN IN HIS HEART HE'S JUST HURTIN YOU DON'T THINGS HAVE GONE BAD FOR A WHOLE FAMILY AND HE'S JUST HURT IN HIS HEART DON'T KILL HIM OVER IT AND I LOOKED AT THE NEGOTIATIN I SAID GET THAT ON TAPE AND WE'LL PLAY THAT FOR HIM BECAUSE IF WE CAN GET THAT ON TAPE EXACTLY THE WAY THEY SAT IT THATO LAND BUT IF WE PUT HIM ON A PHONE WITH THEM THEY'E GONG TO TRY TO REASON WITH HEM ANDTHEY GAN TO SAY STUFF TO EM THAT DIDN'T HELP BUCH THEY DON'T VERY WELL INTENTION BUT IT'S GOING TO BE CONENTUTIVE AND IT'S PROBABLY GING TO MAKE IT WORSE SO YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND FAMILY CAN BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IF YOU GET HIM TO SAY EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO NEED TO BE HIGHLY ORCESTRATED BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW IT'S GON A LAND AND UNFORTUNATELY THINK IF YOU GET HIM IN A DIRECT CONVERSATION IT'LL PROBABLY RENEW IN OLD WOUND YOU DON'T FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE HERD EACH OTHER IN WAYS THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA EVEN HAPPENED AND SO THE OTHER YOU NO FAMILY MEMBER MY SENT THAT TO STAY REMEMBERS WHEN I TOLD HIM SANTA CLAUS WASN'T REAL AND I HAVE NOT TIN OU I HAVE NO MEMORY   OT Y THE I SAY R KNO ALRYR WAY WE GET ONE LEGULES UTE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE HERT EACH OTHER OVER THE YEARS THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHICH COMES UP IN THESE LIVE CONVERSATIONS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD WOUND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WOUNDS ARE THERE THAT YOU CAUSE AND SO IN IN A CONTAIN SITUATION A FAMILY MEMBER CAN BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL BUT IT HAS TO BE IT'S IT'S A SURGICAL SHOT THAT YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY REALLY REALLY CAREFUL WITH OTHERWISE YOU CAN GO THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE WOUNDS IN PUPILON EVEN OR THERE SAS USA PSYCHOLOGICALLY A STUTE WAY OF VIEWING IT BECAUSE I'M A BIG FAN OF THE SO CALLE FAMILY SYSTEM'S MODEL OF PSYCHOLOGY IM AND YOU CAN'T LOOK AT ANY HUMAN BEING PSYCHOLOGY POSITIVE MEANING ADAPT IF OR MAL ADAPT O PSYCHOLOGY AND NOT LOOK AT THE FAMILY SYSTEM WHICH THAT EVOLVED IM WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT SOME PERFECTLY HEALTHY FAMILYES OCCASION Y DON'T HAVE HISSUES WITH A CHILD HAVING MENTAL ILLNESS AND AND  THAT HAPPENS BUT I'M TOLD THAT NINETY NINE POINT NINE PER CENT OF THE TIME YOU CAN IDENTIFY A FAMILY SYSTEM ORGANIZATION OR A LINEAGE A GYRNETIC TIE ET CETERA THAT THAT MAKES THINGSTART TO MAKE SENSE WHEN SOMEBODY'S REALLY STRUGGLE AND AND AS YOU POINT OUT A SADLY OFTENTIMES THAT THAT INVOLVES UM PAINS OF PAST UM WELL WHAT THANKS FOR SHARING THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT AM IN MY MIND THE MOVI VERSION OF IT IS YOU KNOW THEY BRING THE MOTHER IN AND IT'S LIKE BILLY DON'T DO IT YOU KNOW T AS HE SAYD YOARD MI IKE THAT MIGHT BE THE TIME WHEN BILLY'S REALLY GIN TO LET HIS MOTHER KNOW YOU KNOW ISACT  RI AN ATS NOT WHAT YOU WANT EGONESS WHAT A COMPLEX JOB WHAT A COMPLEX HIGH STAKES HIGH CONSEQUENCE JOB WHAT DID YOU DO TO UNLOAD SOME OF THE HEAVINESS OND I'M NOT JUST TARTING OUT GETTING A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP OR HAVING A A BEER WITH YOUR CO WORKERS AFTER ALTHOUGH THOSE THINGS SURE YOU KNOW IMPORTANT ROLVS FOR M FOR PEOPLE I REALIZE A YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK WE CAN DUMP THE HARD STUFF IN OUR HEAD IN OUR HEARTS IN A WAY THAT UM YOU KNOW ALLOWS US TO BE FUNCTIONAL CAUSE YOU KNONT PEOPLE IN YOUR LINE OF WORK AND I THINK JUST ANY ONE IN THE WORLD YOU YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH YOU CAN YOU'RE GON EXPERIEN T'S LOSS YET YOU'RE GONG TO GET KICKED INAND A GOT YET AND YOU'REGONG TO SEE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT GET KICKED IN THEY GOT THERIT THAT'S THERE'S SO MUCH BEAUTY TO LIFE AS WELL BUT BUT THAT'S THE REALITY SO UM DID YOU YOU HAVE TOOLS PROCESSES THAT YOU USE TO KANT DON'T THE BAGGAGE THAT YOU CAN LEAN INTO YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AN YOUR RELATIONSHIP YOURSELF UM WITH WITH RERESTORED SENSE OF OPTIMISM IM YET I THINK MOSTLY MOST OF PEOPLE THAT I'VE ALWAYS WORKED AROUND WE BEEN VERY RE ENFORCING OF ONE ANOTHER UM COMMEDICALLY I MOTIONALLY FRIENDSHIP WISE YOU DON'T BEEN ABLE TO LAUGH WITH EACH OTHER TAKEN IT EASY ON EACH OTHER CAN PEOPLE ETIN A LAUGHTER  AND GENUINE UNDERSTANDING WITH WITHA WITHOUT THM YOU NOW SOMEBODY TRYNG TO TELL YOU THAT  YOU DID WRONG I'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO TE FIND MYSELF IN THOSE GROUPS MOST OT A TIME OR WE'D WE JUST EVOLVED IT THAT'S JUST THE WAY THAT WE WERE WE WERE ATTRACTED TO ONE ANOTHER EMOTIONALLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY BECAUSE OF THAT THAT'S PROBABLY IT MOSTLY I MEAN I'VE TRIED TO PAR SOME O THESE EMOTIONS OUT RECENTLY LIKE I'M NOT PARTICULARLY PROUD OF ANYTHING I'VE EVER THAT DONE BUT I ALWAYS FELT LIKE IT WAS A PRIVILEGE I YOU MUST BE PROUD OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S PRIDE BUT THERE'S THERE'S OTHER FATISFACTION THAT I GET OUT OF IT AND SO THINKING ABOUT WHAT DRIVES ME ALSO NOW OU NO TAT I'M RUNNING A COMPANY AND I'M  AND I GOT PEOPLE ALSO ONTR PANEWERS THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE BEST FOR THE EMPLOYS YOU KNOW WHATAR WE ENCOURAGING ONE ANOTHER SO THAT WHATEVER WERE DOING PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT AND I TRIED TO TAKE A LOT OF THAT FROM WHAT I LEARNED ISN'T IFPIAAGE AND AND A HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR AND PEOPLE THAT I WAS AROUND AND YOU KNOW WE DID JOKE WITH EACH OTHER LOT AND WE DID A PLAY TRICKS ON EACH OTHER YOU KNOW GOOD GOOD NATURED HUMOR AVOID THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING YOU DOWN BUT BE ABLE TO YOU DON'T TAKE TAKE CARE SOME GOOD NATURED RIBBING EVERY NOW AND THEN I  AND I THINK HUMOROUS IS A ONE WAY ANOTHER COMBINED WITH HARD WORK AND AN APPRECIATION FOR WHAT YOURE DOING A MOST PROBABLY BEEN MOST OF THE MENTAL HEALTH LONG A WAY OCCASIONAL BURBON LOVE IT A WE DID A WHOLE EPISODE ON ALCOHOL AND SO PEOPLE ER CAN HEAR ME SAY LOVE IT AND THEN AWAY HERE I'M SUPPORTING OUT EDISEN BUT DAY TO SAY AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT AN ALCOHOLIC AS LONG AS YOU ARE OF AGE A PROBABLY TWO DRINKS SO WEEK AS OR LAST IS SAFE A MAKE EM MAKE EM GOOD HIGH QUALITY DRINKS IF YOU'RE GAN TO HAVE THEM CONSUME THEM IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT OR DON'T CONSUM THEM IN ALL BUT A THAT'S WHAT I SAID LE OF IT I I I SUPPORT YOUR YOUR LOVE OF BURBON A I'M NOT BURBON DRINKER BUT A TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE UP TO LATELY YOU ALLUDED TO IT A MOMENT AGO TAT YOURE RUNNING TEAMS THETTER DOING A LOT SAY YOU'RE YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW HELPING PEOPLE HELP PEOPLE A PROVIDING LOT OF SERVICE IN THE WORLD THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHANNELS A FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY THAT YOUR BOOK NEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS THANK YOU A I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY I DON'T ENDORSE BOOKS VERY OFTEN BUT THE BOOKS I DO INDORSE I LOVE LOVE LOVE I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THAT IT'S A TOSSE UP BETWEEN YOUR BOOK NEVER SPLIT THE DIS DIFFERENCE AND THE BODY KEEPS THE SCORE E THE AWARD FOR BEST TITLES OF ANY BOOK THOSE IS LIKE AMAZING TITLES AMAZING AMAZING TITLES TALL RAS A WRIA CO WRITER CAME UP WITH THE TITLE YET IT WASE PHENOMINAL TITLE THAT IN THE BODY KEEP THE KEEPS THE SCORE JUST LIKE BECAUSE IT'S THERE SO MUCH CONTAINED IN IN THE TITLE AND THEN THE BOOK A EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS SO A REALLY AMAZING BOOK PEOPLE SHOULD LISTEN TO IT READ IT IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY YOU'RE DOING A LOT MORE RIGHT NOW THAN I'M BEEN JUST WRITING ALTHOUGH I WON'T HEAR ABOUT YOUR OTHER BOOK PROJECTS AS WELL BUT BEFORE YOU LIST OFF THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU ARE DOING TELL ME FIRST ABOUT FIRESIDE CAUSE THIS SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY INTERESTING I'M ENDEAVOR THAT FRANKLY AVEN HEARD OF BEFORE I'M WHAT'S FIRESIDE A BRAND NEWS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM A IT'S ESSENTIALLY AN INTERACT OF POTCAST IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FOUNDE BY FOLLEN FATEME AND MARK CUBAN FOUNIN I'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR NUMBER YEARS SHE WAS GUGLE'S YOUNGEST EMPLOY SHE'S AN ANTROPANEWR DYNAMIC SMART HARD CHARGE IN PARSON AND IT'S SORTO GREW OUT OF WHAT'S INADEQUATE IN SOME OF THE SOCIAL MEDIN AP SET HER OUT THERE UM TRYING TO COMBINE THE BEST IDEAS OF A FEW DIFFERENT THANKS AND FOUND SUGGESTED IT TO ME AND I THOUGHT I'LL JUMP IN BECAUSE SHE'S A VISIONARY AND WHAT IS TURNED OUT TO BE AS IT'S EFFECTIVELY WEEKLY INTERACTIV GROUP COACHON AND YOU YOU GET THE AP OFF YOUR IPHONE OR YOUR ANDROYD WHATEVER PLATFORM YOUR PHONE IS ON AND IN YOU LOG IN WE DO AN HOUR ONCE A WEEK AND IT'S YOU'RE GETTING GROUP COACHING AND THEN YOU GET ASK QUESTIONS AND IT'S GOT OF VIDIA COMPONENT TO IT SO IF YOU WANT ASK A QUESTION WE WE'RE GING TO BRING YOU UP ON QUOTE STAGE AND I GET TO SEE YOU AND TALK DIRECTLY TO YOU EN YOU GET A SEE ME AND TALK DIRECTLY TO ME OR A I INTERVIEWED MARKED HUBAN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHEN PEOPLE GOT TO COME ON AND A ASK MARK QUESTIONS OR ASK ME QUESTIONS AND WHAT IT IS TURNED OUT TO BEAS IS ONE OF SORT OF A A THE THUT THE NEXT LEVEL OF HOW TO GET BETTER AT NEGOTIATIONS AFTER YOU'VE READ THE BOOK AND PROBABLY TAKEN THE MASTER CLASS YOU KNOW WHERE DO YOU GO NEXT ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT CAME ON THE POTCAST HERE THE DAY TH THE THE FIRESIDE AM EPISODE THEY SAID WELL I DONNOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY YET TO GO TO YOUR IN PERSON TRAINING EVENTS CASOLES ARE EXPENSIVE AND THIS IS TW IM GOING TO GET BETTER IN THE IN A MEANTIME AND WORK MY WAY IN THAT DIRECTION AND SO THE MONTHLY COACHING IF YOU WERE TO SIGN UP FOR GROUP COACHING FROM US ON A REGULAR BASIS ON A MONTHLY BASIS IT WOULD PROMPTLY EASILY COST YOU FOR WHAT WERE PROVIDING TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND THIS IS A THOUSAND A YEAR SO AT SCALE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH ME AND THE MEMBERS ON MY TEAM ONCE A WEEK AN GET GROUP COACHING AND IT'S AND IT'S JUST KIND OF FUN WE'RE GETIN O KICK OUT OF IT AND PEOPLE THAT REALLY REALLY CARE ABOUT INTERACTING WELL WITH PEOPLE GUY COMES ON THE FIRST EPISODE I DID AND HE SAID BESIDES THE FACT THAT YOU HELP ME MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY YOU HELP ME SAVE MY MARRIAGE AND HE JUST NEEDED TO KNOW HOW TO TALK MORE GENUINELY AND HONESTLY WITH HIS WIFE IN A WAY THE MELE MADER FELT HURD AND HE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A  GOOD WAY TO DO THAT BEFOREHAND AND I WAS JUST LIKE THAT'S A LOT I DON'T I DON I NOKNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT OR THAN JUST BE GRATEFUL THIT PEOPLE CAN SAY STUP LIKE THAT TO US SO THE FIRESIDE THINGS CONTICAL WERE STILL EXPERIMENTING WITH IT IT'S AN INTERACTOF POTCAST GROUP COACHING IT'S FUN GRATE I MEAN I WOULD SAY A TE CHANGING LIVES THERE I MEAN THE SAVING O MARRIAGESMO I NO SMALL DEAL AND I THINK THAT THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AM DIRECTLY WITH PEOPLE ALSO IMAGINE GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNIE TO IMPLEMENT THAT THE TOOLS THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING IN REAL TIME IT'S ONE THING TO HERE ABOUT SOMETHING AND AND TRY IT BUT THEN A YOU CAN GIVE FEE BACK IN REAL TIME OR YOU ON THESE THESE FIRESIDE CHATS DIRECTLY OR MEMBERS OF YOUR TEAM NOW I I DO WE DO ONE EVERY WEEK AND I'M ONCE A MON AND THE OTHER THING TOO LIKE I CAN EXPLAIN SOMETHING ONE WAY AND IF FOR WHATEVER REASON IT DOESN'T LAND IN YOUR CONTACT YOU CAN'T QUITE GET IT SO THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND ABOUT THE INNER ACT IF NATURE OF ITS SOMEBODY COMES ON AND ASK A QUESTION IN THEIR CONTACT AND THAT I'LL ANSWER IT AN  GO LIKE IL   OKE RI THAT HELPED SO YOU GET YOU GET TO HEAR PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO'S STRUGGLING WITH IT THE WAY YOU ARE BUT I HAVEN'T PUT IT IN YOUR CONTACT YET AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT'S GREAT ABOUT A CUAN I LIVE UNE WE AT A GUEST ON HERE WHO TOLD ME THAT THERE ARE AMAZING DATA SUPPORTING THE FACT THAT PEOPLE FOLLOW THE MEDICAL AND HEALTH ADVICE OF DOCTORS THAT THEY CAN RELATE TO FAR MORE THAN THEY FOLLOW THE MEDICAL AND HEALTH ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIANS THAT THEY FEEL AREN'T LIKE THEM IM AND OFTENTIMES THIS CAN INCLUDE THE PHYSICIAN OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER BEING SOMEONE THAT THEY WOULD ASPIRE TO BE LIKE BUT OFTENTIMES IT'S JUST SOME COMMON REPORT LIKE THEY BOTH LIKE BASEBALL OR THEY BOTH LIKE TO COOK OR TO GARDEN AND THAT SETS A BRIDGE RWHERE THEN THE PATIENT IS WILLING TO DO ALL THESE THINGS THAT ORDINARILY THEY WOULD BE RESISTANT TO R AND AND THERARE REALLY GOOD DATA TO SUPPORT THIS AND I I THAT THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME CAUSE IT SAYS THAT IT'S S NOT JUST ABOUT THE INFORMATION OR THE THE DELIVERY ROUT OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE CONTACT AND THAT REPORTS EVEN ALONG SOMETHING IS LIKE O YOU YOURA A'M NOT A MAJOR A YOU KNOW A A MAJOR SPORTS FAN ON MOST THINGS BUT YOU KNOW LIKE ALL OURO BILLS FAN OR SOMEHLING ME TOO LIKE THAT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY DOING ALL THE THINGS TO LOWER THE BLICPRASHURE THE DAY AND CHANGING THEIR DIE AL ALL THOSE THINGS VERSES NOT MAKING THE CHANGES REPORT IS A MAGIC YES KIND OF A MAGIC COMPONENT COULD CHANGES THINGES AR WILL FIRESIDE SENE LAKE

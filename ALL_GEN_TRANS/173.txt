WASHINGTON D C ITSELF THE SANTIS SAID THAT THEYD CHARGE CASES IN THIS PARTICULAR DISTRICT AN WAYS THAT WOUD AVOID ALL OF THE MANITORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR OTH GUN AND DRUG TRAFFIKIN CRIMES THE ALLOWED JUVENALS TO AVOID SERIOUS CHARGES OR IN CARCERATION HE SAID PROSECUTERS HAV A CERTAIN AMOUT OF DISCRETION ABOUT WHICH CASES TO BRING WHICH NOT TO BRING THIS STATE ATTORNEY HAS ABUSE THAT DISCRETION AS AN EFFECTIVELY NULLIFIED CERTAIN LAWS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA THE GOVRNOR THEN APPOINTED ANDREW BAN A JUDGE FROM THE SAME JUDICIAL CIRCUIT TO TAKE WORLS PLACE WORLD CAN APPEAL HER SUSPENSION TO THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED STATE SENATE OR GO TO THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT UNLIKELY THAT SHE A SHE IS GOING TO WIN THAT CASE SHE WILL BE THE NEW AMASAN B C HERO OF THE DAY BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS IF YOU DO NOT PERFORMING DROB OR IF YOU DISRUPT THE SYSTEM LIKE A TENNESSY STATE LEGISLATOR WHO JUST TE SIZES TO LEAD A QUASI RIOT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE TENNESSY STATE LEGISLATURE THEN EMASON BES YOUWLL MAKE YOU A HERO IF THEN YOUAR STRIPT OF CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE PRIVILEGES HERE WAS THE ORLANDO STATE A TORNEY DEPOSE A SUGGESTING THAT DON THE BIG PROMM HERES THAT THE

WELL I MEAN IT DID CHANGE THAT YOU'RE NO LONGER THE STATE PROSECUTOR SO I'MEAN THAT THERE THERE IS THAT SAGAN RONDISSANS IS DOING THE THINGS IN FLORIDA THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE IN FLORIDA TO LIVE A A BETTER LIFE THIS THE PART OF THE DESANTIS CAMPAGN THAT HAS BEEN SO FAR KIND OF LACKING IS THE FACT THAT THE SANSIS IS ACTU VERY GOOD AND LEK TEE BASICS OF GOVERNING IN SATE OF FLORIDA MEANING WEN A BRIDGE THAT'S TAKEN OUT BY HURICANE THET THING IS BACK UP WITHIN DAYS MAKE TA HIGHWAYS WORK HERE THE POLICE ARE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS HERE WHEN A PROSECUTOR FAILS TO DO HER JOB SHE GETS FIRED IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND THAT BRED AND BUTTER KIND OF STUFF IS THE REASON THAT DE SANSI IS VERY POPULAR IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA ALL OF THE FIGHTING OF WOKANESS ALL OF THE SORT OF CONTROVERSIAL POLICY POSITIONS THAT DE SANSIS HAS TAKEN ON TOP OF THAT THAT THAT SORT OF THE ICING ON THE CAKE BUT TE CAKE IS THAT DE SANSIS ACTU VERY GOD GOVERNING AND THIS I SOMETHING THAT RE PUBLICAN VOTERS OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT GOING FORWARD WHEN A COMES TIME TO VOTE IN PRIMARIES IS IS DONAL TRUMP GOING TO LUARN THE LESSONS OF HIS FIRST PRECIDENCY AND IS HE THEN GOING TO BE GOOD AT THE BRED AN BUTTER KIND OF STUFF OR 'IS IT JUST GOIN TO BE A REPEAT OF THE FIRST PRESIDENCY IN WHICH ESSHE DIDN'T DO ANY THE BRED AND BUTTER KIND OF STUFF WHOSE CAN OF TE PEOPLE AROUND HIM DOING ALL THAT AND HE'STWEATED A LOT BECAUSE IF YOU ACTUALLY WISH TO SEE THE LEFT LOSE THE THING THAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED IS FOR THE RIGHTS TO BE GOOD AT THE ACTUAL BUSINESS OF GOVERNING KNO HOW TO WEELD POWER INEFFECTIVE WAYS THE SANS IS DOING THENSAID HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE A BRAN CAMPING IN GEORGIA IS VERY GOOD AT AT THE EFFECTIVE USE OF POWER GLEN YON CAN IN VIRGINIA SEEMS TO B USING POWERWELL BUT THE SANTIS HE'S USING IT IN A VERY POWERFUL WAIGHT IN THE STATE O FLORA THAT'S SOMETHING AGAIN THAT SURED FACTORIN TO HOW RE PUBLICANS CONSIDER VOTING IN A PRIMARY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT BEING PRESIDENT ISN'T JUST ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY IT'S

OGAN MEANWHILE DISNEY IS TAKING IT DIRECTLY IN THE TEETH THE YOUR TIMES OF COURSES ATTRIBUTING US TO LARGER MARKET FORCES BUT THE REALITY IS THAT DISNEY HAS COMPLETELY BLOWN OUT A LARGE SIGMENT OF ITS USERBASE AND TIIT DISN'Y S LOST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM MY FAMILY ALONE AND NORMALLY AND A GIVEN YEAR I WOUL TAKE MY FAMILY TO DISNEY LAND OVER HERE IT DISNEY WORLD OVER HERE AND FLORTOUT TAKE THEM THERE AT LEAST THREE TIMES PROBABLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AND I'VE  FAIRLY LARGE FAMILY BUTH LIKE COUSINS IN EVERYTHING SO R TALKING LIKE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THET DISNEY HAS LOST JUST FOR MY FAMILY ND I'VEITHERE A MASSIVE BILL MOLTIME MOLTIBILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION BUT THEY'R LOT PEOPLE HOR LIKE ME THEYR LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT SUBSCRIBING TO DISNEY PLUS YOUVEN TOUGH I OTHERWISE WOULD JUST WATCH THE STARWORS CONTENT BECAUSE DISNEY HAS DECIDED TO SPIT IN THE EYE OF IT'S CONSUMER BASE AND OBVIOUS THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY THEIR CONFLICT FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER WITH THI STATE OF FLORIDA OVER THE CLUSTER OF SECUAL AND DOCTRNATION OF CHILDREN WELL NOW THEN YOUR TIMES REPORTING THAT ROBER IGERS URGENTY TO OVERHAUL DISNEY CAME IN TO SHARP RELIEF ON WEDNESDAY DISNEY' STREAMING OPERATION LOST ON HUT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MOST RECENT QUARTER BRINGING TOTAL STREAMING LOSTS IS SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN DISNEY PLUSS WAS INTRODUCED MORE THAN ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS DISNEY PLUSS LOST ROUGHLY ELEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION SUBSCRIBERS WORLD WIDE IN THE THREE MONTHS THAT ENDED YOU LIFE FIRST FOR NEW TOTAL OF A HUNDRED FORTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION ALL THE DECLINE CAME FROM LOW PRICE VERSION OF DISNEY PLUSS AND INDIAS THEY BASICALLY INFLATED THEIR NUMBERS BY  GETTING A BUNCH PEOPLE TO SIGN UP FOR YOU O THE STARER PACKAGE IN INDIA AND THEN EVERYBODY BASICALLY DROPPED OFF BECAUSE DISNEY LOST TO BIGE FOR N THE EXPENSEIF RIGHTES TO INDIAN FOR MERELY CRICKET MATCH  MATCHES EXCLUDING DIS IN EXCLUDING INDIA DISNEY PLUS GAINED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS PRIMARILY OVER SEESWITHOUT RATE OF GROWTH IS NOT GLOING TO MAKE UP FOR THE KIND OF CLOSS THAT DAY HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING DUE TO STRIMMING SO IGER IS NOW SHIFTING THE FOKS DI DISNEY PLUS AWAY FROM BRISK SUBSCRIBER GROWTH WHICH REQUIRES THOSE BIG MARKENING CAMPAGNS INSTEAD DISNEY HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE MORE MONEY FROM DISNEY PLUS SUBSCRIBERS AT ALREADY HAS BY INCREASING THE PRITE ANOTHER HAVE TE PRIC IN CREASES ON THE WAY STARTING ON OCTOBER TWELFTH THE AD FREE VERSIONAL COST FOURTEEN DOLLARS POOLO WHICH IS CONTROL BY DISIN WILL BEGIN CHARGING EIGHTEEN BUCK FOR ADFRY ACTES THAT'S UP ROM FIFTEEN BUCKS AS AN INCENTIVE DISNE WILL BEGIN SELLING A NEW STRIMMING PACKEGE AVVREY ACTES TO BOTH DISNEY PLUS ANDHUL FOR TWENTYBUK MONTH STARTING ON SUPTEMBER SIX NOW AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPANING HERE IS THAT A LOT OF PRORSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS PEOPLE LIKE ME HAVE BEEN DROPPING LOFF SO IT'S REALLY LOWERING THEI'R GROWTH CURVE AN ELETHERN PER CENT IN CREASE IN PROFITABILITY AT DISNEYS THEM PMARK DIVISIONS DESPITE WEAKNESS WALT DISNEY WORLD AN FLORDA ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO SALVAGE THE QUARTER TO A DEGREE BUT THEY'RE REALLY GETTIN CLOH AND OTHER TEEN PARK OPERATORS AND FLORTA HAVE SEEN ATTENDANTS DE CLINES HISTORICALLY WHEN BUTGERS GET TIGHT FAMILYS CUT BACK ON EXPENSIVE TRIPS O DIZEY UBAS ONCHUS THAT AGAIN THERE IS A POLITICAL ASPECT TO THIS AND HERE IS A THING A MARGINAL MOVE ON A MAJOR COMPANY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE EVERYBODY ASSUMES THET GIAN CIANE COMPANIES RUN EXTRAORDINARY PROFET MARGINTS AND TAT'S NOT TRUE IT'S NOT TRUE THE PROPET MARGINS PERTICTING THE MEDIA BUSINESS CAN BE EXTREMELY SLIM AND SO IF YOU DING THE PROFPHET MARGIN BY A CERTAINE PER CENTAGE IF YOU ALIENATE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF YOUR QUAR CUSTOMER BASE THAT HAS REALLY OUTSIDES RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE BROADER MARKET BE CAUSE REMEMBER VALUATION WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC MARKETS IS ALWAYS A MULTIPLE OF THE ACTUAL CASH FLOW OR THE ACTUAL EBIT DO OF THE COMPANY WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF A COMPANY SAY HAS A A GROST IN COME A THAT THE GROWT THEY TAKE IN IS A BILLION DOLLARS YEAR THAT COMPANY'S NOT VALUED AND A BILLION DOLLARS ON PUBLIC MARKETS CAN' GET VALUE TO LIKE TEN BILLION FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON THE PUBLIC MARKETS TO PENDING ON WHAT INDUSTRY N SECTOR THE COMPANY IS IN SO THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU DING THAT COMPANY BY SAY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND IT GOES DOWN FROM A BILLION TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IF YOU DO THAT THAN THE MULTIPOLE WHAT SAY IT'S IT A TEN LEVEL IS GOING TO GO DOWN CONCOMINENTLY AT THAT FIFTY MILLION IS GOING TEND UP LOOKING MORE LIKE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WHN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL MARKET CAP OF THE COMPANY TO GENACTURY SERIOUSLY DING A COMPANY IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS SIMPLY BY ALIENATIG A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF YOUR CUSTOMER BAYS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DISNEY HAS DONE BY GETTING INTO THIS BLEEP FIGHT WHET GOVERNOR TO SANTIS THE STATE OF FLORDA AND MORE BROADLY PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND TE'RE ONLY YN TO GET WORSE BY THE WAY MEAN THE FACT THA THEY ARE NOW DOING LIKE WOKE SNOW WHITE IS SO UPON KNOW WHAT THEIR THINKING OVER THERE OR WHY THEY THING THAT IS A GROWTH AREA WHO ARE THEY CATERING TO SERIOUSLY ARE THE CARRINGS OF THE CHINESE MARKET IT USED TO BE THAT DISNEYS THAT THE BIG RAP AGINS DISNES THAT THEY WERE CATTRING TO THE CHINESE MARKET BY FILMING LIKE MULAN IN CHONCHANG AND IGNORING THE SLAVE LABOR OF MUSLIMS AND AT LEAST YOU CULD MAKE THE CASE ON A MARKET LEVEL THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO APPEAL TO UNOTE I THE GIANT CHINESE MARKET BUT WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING TO MAKE WOKE SNOW WHITE WITH LIKE NON P DWARVES AS THE DWARVES WHO EXACTLY ARE THEY APPEALING TO IS NOT THE CHINESE MARKET WHAT IS THAT CLERER THEY DOING AND THE ANSWER IS THAT THEY OF BEEN VICTIMS OF INSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE BY THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND I ASSUME THAT AS THE MARKETS STARTS TO TO CLINEWILL TIM BY THE ECONOMY MOMENTARILY THAT AS THE MARKET STARTS TOR CLINES SUSINENS GON TO HAVE TO DO WHAT EVERY OTHER COMPANY IS DOING AN THER CAN T HAVE TO GET RID OF

ECONOMY I 'M SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SANGUINE ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY I KNOW TOO MANY IN VESTERS WO ARE HOLDING THEIR MONEY IN A BAYINS KNOWING THAT THE ECONOMY IS ON RAISERS EDGE EVERY ONE I TALK TO A IN INVESTMENT CIRCLES AND I DO A FAIR SHARE OF INVESTING EVERY ONE I'M TALKING TO IS HOLDING THEIR MONEY OUT OFTHE MARKET RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY IT'S GOING TOGO WELL TO DAY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDECKS CAME OUT AGAIN AND I IT SET IT SOWE THAT PRICE IS ROSE THREE POINT TWO PER CENTS IN JULY FROM A YEAR AGO SO JUNIAL RECALL WAYS DOWN TO THREE PER CENT WHICH STILL FIFTY PER CENT HIGHER THEN THE FAD SEEKS RIHT THE FED ONCE TO TWO PER CENT REAT OF INCREASE YEAR ON YEAR THAT A SORT OF THE MILTON FREEMEN SCHICAGOS SCHOOL IDEA THAT YOU IF YOU IF YOU CONSTANTLY D IN INFLATE TOE CURRENCY AND DFLY VALUE THAT IF YOU DO THAT IT'S GOING TO SPUR A CERTAIN LEVEL OF COMMY CON SUMER SPENDSING AND IT'S GOING TO KEEP THE WHEELS CHURNING AND ALL THE REST FITS I'AM SORTVEF OF THEENNA SCHOOL GUY IN IN THE SENSE THAT IRN I SHOULD BELIEVE IN TWO PER CENT IN FLATION RADES OP BY THE FAT I THING WE SHOULD SEE A ZERO PER CENT IN FLACIA RATE FROM THE FAD AND MONEY SHOULD BE WORH WHAT MONEY WAS WORTH TEN YEARS AGO OR TWENTY YEARS AGO AND WE SHOULD STOP IN FLATING AWAY PEOPLE SAVINGS BUT CALL ME A CLASSISIST THE FACT IS THAT TWO PER CENT IS WHAT WE HAVE AIMED AT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS LAST MONTH YOUARE ON YOURIC COMMIT AT THREE PER CENTS TAY THAT IS FIFTYP THAT IS A FULL FIFTY PER CENT HIGHER NOW I KNOW THAT OUR MINDS HAVE NOW BEEN WARPED BY THE FACT THAT WE HDE LIKE TEN PER CENT IN FLATION FOR A WHILE THERE THANKS TO SUPPLY CHAIN THANKS TO COVET AND THANKS YOU DRO BIDNS IN FLATIONARY MONITARY AND FISCAL POLICIES BUT THREE PER CENT STILL WAY TOO HIGH LITERALLY FIFTY PER CENT TOO HIGH OSPMUST BE TO IT IS RATE THOSE LASTMA WE'RE TOLD THOSE ALSOM WELL NOW IT'S THREE POINT TWO PER CENT YOU'RE ON YORE WHICH MEANS THAT THE RATE OF INCREASE CONTINUES TO BE TOO HIGH AN NOW THE BRINGING DOWN THE RATE OF INCREASE FROR NINE PER CENT BUT IT STILL AT THREE POINT TWO PER CENT WHICH BY MY CALCULATION IS STILL MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT TOO HIGH HEN A MONTHLY BASEIS PRICES STICKED UP ZURE POINT TO PERSCENT BETWEEN JUNE ANJULY ECONOMIS SAY THAT THE BUMP IS LINKED TWO TEMPORARY FACTORS INCLUDING REBOUNDING AIR LINE HOTEL AND ENERGY PRICES THEY'RE NOT LIKELY TO A RODE LONG OR TERM PROGRESS BUT IARE NOT THAT MEANS AT RODE LONGER LIKE WHERE OTKON N JRUN BACK UP TO SEVEN PER CENT BUT ARE WE ETTING BACK DOWN TO TWO PER CENT THE OVER ALL MUMBER WAS ALSO HIGHER BECAUSE PRICES ARE BEING COMPARED AT THE RATES OF IN CREASE LAST JULY THE FIRST MONTH WHEN INFLATION BEGAN TO FALL AFTER A LONG CLIMBEAT AGAIN THAT ITS STILL A PRICE INCREASE AGAIN IF THE CURVE LOOKS  SORT OF LIKE THIS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THA HERE IT SOMEHOW LOWER THAN HERE THAT'S NOT CORRECT IF FOR THOSE WHO CANTS HAT I'M DOING MY HAND HERE ES SENTIUALLY I'M DRAWING A CURVE THET THE VERBIAN LOOKS VERY STEEP AND THEN SARCH TO SHALLOW OUT BUT IS STILL INCREASING WEARE NOW AT THE SHALLOWED OLT BUT STILL INCREASING RATE OF INFLATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND AT' STILL AGAIN FIFTY PERCENT TOO HIGH PUCHJOSE RU ROM A OUS AECONOMIS TO BARPLACES IN THE GRAND SCHEME WE ARE SEEING DISTINFLATION AND THINGS ARE MOVING INTHE RETSURRECTION IF YOU LOOK PASS THE VOLITAL CATEGORIES UNDERLING LAMENTUM HAS NOT CHANGE HOWEVER IRE RE BACK TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE OBVIOUSLY NIT TTHIS IS SPURRING TALK THAT THEFEDERAL RESERVE IS BASILY GOING TO TRY TO HOLD OUT HERE TAND NOT INCREASE THE INTERESTRATES AGAIN BUT I DON'T SEE EVIDENCE THAT THE RATE IS DROPPING DOWN TO TWO PER CENT WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ACTION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THIS IS WY IT SEEMS LIKE THE STOCK MARKET IS REALLY VOLI OR RIHT NOUS CAN IN GOING UP IT'S GOING DOWN IS CAN A STICK IN AROUND THE SAME GENERALIZE LEVEL THE REASON FOR THAT IS DEEP UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE INIMPACT OF THE POLICIES THET ARE BEING PURSUED RIGHT NOW AGAIN WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT OVER ALL MEASURERS OF ECONOMIC HELTH WHT YOU'RE SEEING IS BUSINESS DISINVESTMENT YOU'RE SEEN MORTGAGE LENDING DRY UP YOU'RE SEEING THOSE THOSE RATES OF INTREST ON NEW MORTGAGES GO WAY WAY WAY UP AND EVENTUALLY EVENTUALLY WHEN PEOPLE START LOSING JOBS BECAUSE THE MONEY DRIES UP THAET'S CAN BE A LOT PEOPLE HOS STAR DEFAULTING ON TATS AND WHN THE START TYFAULTING ON TAT'S BANKS ARE GON TO TAKE TO HEAD AND WEN THOSE BANKS ARE IN VEST IN BONDS THAT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT BLEED OVER EFFECTS WIR HE BROADER ECONOMY IF SILKAN VALLYBANK INVESTED TOO HEAVILY IN GOVERNMENT BONDS AND LOW INTEREST BEARING RATES AND THEN THEY GOT BLOWN OUT BEGAS THE HIGHER INTEREST RACTE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS OFFERING ON ITS NEO BONDS BUT THAT'S CAUSE THE MARGINS INTERENS BONDS WHERE TWO

RAN NOW  CUSSION OF O IS LOW DOWN ORI SAS SI DON'T WNT A COMLINIM IN ON DETAIL WO WO YOU KNOW I ON'T TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ABOUT THE FACT THAT NO ONE TRUSTS THE GOVERNMENT RIHT OWT BECAUSE NOT ONLY S THEGOVERNMENT NOT TRANSPARENT WITH YOU BUT THE MEDIA WHORE SUPPOSEDTO BE THE WATCH DOG ARE NOT TRANSPARENT WITH YOU SO LONG AS HE DEMOCRAT IS IN THE OVAL OFFICE IF IT EM CRID IS IN THE OVAL OFFICE THEY'ARE NOT TRANSPARENT WITH YOU IF REPUBLICAN IS IN THE OVEL OFFICE NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT TRANSPARENT WITH YOU ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN THEY'RE FULLY NON TRANSPARENT ABOUT ALL INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE REPUBLICAN WHEN DID ALL OF THIS HAPPEN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK THAT TERE WAS NOT A GROUND SHIFT IN THEWAY AMERICANS THINK ABOUT THEIR INSTITUTIONS THAT WAS COINCIDENT WITHTHE RISOBROCKOBOMA I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT OVER THE COURSE THE PAST WEEK IRE'S A MASSIVELY IMPORTAT INTERVIEW OVER AT TABLET MAGAZINE WHICH IS A GREAT WEBSITE THAT'S WORSH THE REED THEY DIDN'T INTERVIEW WITH A THE HISTORIAN AME DAVID GARROW WHO WROTE A P LITUR PRIZEWENNG BIOGRAPHY OF MARTNLUTHER KANG AND THEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN HE HAD A BA BIOGRAPHY OF BAROKOBAMA IN HIS EARLIEARS ANDIT WAS ALLED RISING STARS BY ALL RIGHT TO TRIPBEN LIKE A MASSIVE HIT THIS O THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT ACTULLY UNCOVERED A BUNCH OF STUFF ABOUT ABAMA THE THEMMEDIA NEVER WOULD AVE COVERED LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT IN DREAMS FROM MY FATHER WHIH IS ALMOST ENTIRELY FECTIONALIZED APPARENTLY ACCORIG TODIVGARRO THAT WHEN BAROKABAM ROTE HIS FIRST MEMOIR DREAMS FOR MY FATHER HE HAS AN INCIDENT WHERE HE BROKE UP WITH A WHITE GIRL FRIENDS SUSPPOTE SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE SHE COULN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WANT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HI BLACK IDENTITY AND WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS THAT SHE BROKE UP WITH HIM BECAUSE HE WAS COVERING FOR RAVHING BLACK ANTITEMITES THAT'S WHAT DAVID GARRL UN COVERED MEDIA NEVER CHECKED IN TO IT THEY NEVER FOUND THE GIRL FRIEND THEY NEVER DOG INTO ANYTHING REMOTELY RELATED TO BAROKABAMA BY THE WAY OTHER REVELATIONS INCLUDED IN THIS BOOK WHERE ACTUAL HAND WRITTEN LETTERS FROM BAROKOBAMA TO ONE OF HIS GIREL FRIENDS TALKING ABOUT HIS AND IS A DIRECT QUOTE REPEATEDLY FANTICIZING ABOUT MAKING LOVE TO MEN AND MING THAT THE PRETTY BOMSHELL KIND OF STUFF NO IM PRETTY WILD AND SELATIOUS NONE OF IT RECEIVED VIRTUALLY ANY COVERAGE AT THE TIME BUT WHY AND THE ANSER IS BECAUSE THE MEDIA WEN BAROKOBAMA ROSE TO THE PRESIDENCY AND AS HE MADE THAT RISE THE MEDIA DECIDED THAT THEY WERE NOW THE ACTUAL PROTORIAN GUARD THE'RE ALWAYS BY US TO THE LEFT BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY CERTAIN LIKE A LEVEL OF BASE LINE HONESTY THAT REQUIRED THEM O STILL REPORT ON THINGS AND THEN BAROKABAMA ROSE TO LEVEL OF TE PRESIDENCY AND EVERY INSTITUTION WAS WEAPONIZED ON BEHALF OF THIS MAN PERSONALLY THAT'S ACTUALLY WAT HAPPEN THE ENTIRE COMMEDIC INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE FOR EXAMPLE SAID IT IS FORBIDDEN TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT ABAMA YOU CANNOT MAKE JOKES ABOUT THIS ABSOLUTELY SELF OBSESSED RIDICULOUS MAN BECAUSE HE IS ACTUALLY AMESIANA FIGURE YOU REMEMBER THE CRISROCK SAID THAT HE'S LIKE THE COUNTRY'S DAD THIS IS THIS THE KIND OF SO COMEDY OUT ENCERTAINMENT OUT THEY WR ALL WORSHIPPNG AT THE ALTAR THE MEDIA OUT AND OURE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ALSO STARTED REFLECTING EVERYTHING WITH REGARD TO OBAMA DAVID TAMUELS OF TABLET WHOSE INTERVIEWING GARRO E SAID RISING STAR HIGHLIGHTS A REMARKABLE LACK OF CURIOSITY ON THE PART OF MAINSTREAM REPORTERS AN INSTITUTIONS ABOUT A MAN WHO ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY WAS TREATED LESS LIKE A POLITICIAN AND MORE LIKE THE IDOL OF AN INTER E LEAD CULT AND IT'S TRUE LIKE THE ENTIRE TECK WORLD REVOLVED AROUND BAROKOBAMA HE BECAME LIKE THE CENTER OF THE POLITICAL UNIVERSE EVERYBODY THINKS THE CENTR OF THE POLITICAL UNIVERSE IS DONAL TRUMPET THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY RIGHT THE CENTER OF THE POLITICAL UNIVERSE SINCS TOO THOUSANDATE HAS BEEN BAROKOBAMA DONAL TRUMP IS A REACTION TO BAROKOBAMA JOBIDON IS REACTION TO DONAL TRUMP AND HAPPENS TO BE THE THIRD TURM OF BAROKOBAMA SINCE EVERY PERSON IN POSITION OF MAJOR STAFFING POWER IS A BAROKABAMA AKALITE BAROKABAM BY THE WAY STILL RESIDES MOST OF THE URNWASHINGTON TO CEE AND ITS AMAZING TO ME THAT NOBODY'S ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED TO TRACK DOWN HOW MUCH DOES BAROKABAMA ACTUALLY TALK WITH ALL THE PEOPLE WHO USED TO WORK WITH HIM AND SHAPE POLICY INSIDE THE BIDON ADMINISTRATION AND AGAIN THE CORRUPTION OF ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ROM THE BACK OF BAROKABAMAS PERSONAL SELF OBSESSION IS TRULY AN AMAZING THING SA DAVID GARRO'S BIOGRAPHERMOBAMA HE SAYS IN THIS INTERVIEW QUOTE HE HAS NO INTEREST IN BUILDING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS AN INSTIT UTION I THINK THAT'S OBVIOUS IT ONLY HE HAD ANY TRULY DEEP MEANINGFUL POLICY COMMETMENTS OTHER THAN THE NEED TO FEEL IN TO BE PERCEIVED AS VICTORIOUS AS TRIUMPHANT BUT BECAUSE ALL THE INSTITUTIONS WENT INTO DEFENDOBOMAMOTE THAT HAS CARRIED FORWARD TO JOBIDON AND HERE'S A THING THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT WHEN IT ACTUALLY WAS WHEN IT ACTUALLY WAS BAROKABOMIC IS BAROKAMMA HAD THIS SORT OF MESSIANIC QUALITY TO HIM AT HE WAS ACTULLY A REALLY GOOD SPEAKER HE WAS ACTUALLY A CELEBRITY TYPE BUT JOBIDON ISN'T AND SO AS THAT MASK HAS STRIPPED AWAY AND AS THE MEDIA HAVE JUST BEEN DEMONSTRABLY PROVED TO BE MEMBERS OF THAT INTERLY CALT OF COURSE FAITH IN THEN HAS ABSOLUTELY PLUMETED AND OF COURSE THE COUNTRY IS POLARIZED BECAUSE THE INSTITUTIONS THT AT LEAST UED TO HAVE SORT OF A BASELINE GOLL AND PURPOSE THEY HAD O FILL EVEN OF THEIRS POLITICAL BIIC INVOLVE EVERY ONE DISTRUST THOSE INSTITUTIONS NOW AND FOR ABSOLUTELY GOOD REASON AN WHAT THAT ALSO MEANS TIT'S VERY EASY WHEN AN INSTITUTION FAILS TO IMMEDIATELY ATTRIBUTE IT TO THIS SORT OF INTERLY CALLED STATUS IS IT FAILURE OR IS IT MALICE I'VE SOD MANY TIMES THAT I TRIED TO ATTRIBUTE AS MUCH LIKE CA IN STUPIDITY RATHER THAN MALICE BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHEN MALICE HAS BEEN PURSUED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AGAINST TO PROTICULAR POINT OF VIEW AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU START TO SEE THAT MAY BE IT'S NOT STUPIDITY MAY BE IT IS MALICE DOES 'T MEAN ALL THITS MALICE BUT IT MEANS I'S EASY TO OVER A TRIBUTE TWO MALICE RATHER THANTUSTUPIDITY WHICH LEADS TO FURTHER POLITICAL POLARIZATION AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ALL OVER THE PLACE INSTITUTIONALLY SPEAKING IN THE UNITED STATES TO REALLY GRAVE EFFECT BY THE WAY BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS THAT EACH SIDE IS NOW BOUNCING OFF THE OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE REACTING TO TO ANYTHING DEMOCRATS SAY BY SAYING THAT IF DEMOCRATATE IT WE MUST LOF IT WHICH IS A BAD IDEA AND DEMOCRATS ARE REACTING T ANYTHING THE REPUBLICAN SAY BY SAYING THAT IF REPUBLICANS LIKE IT WE MUST HATE IT ALL OF THAT WAS CREATED BY THE BAROKOBOMA ERA THIS IS NOT DONAL TRUMPSER THAT IS STILL BAROKUBON AZEUR WOERE JUST LIVING IN THE AFTERMAUTH OF THAT ERA AS I'VE SAID MAN TIMES ABOUT DONA TRUMP PEOPLE SAVE THAT HE KILLED AMERICAN POLITICS DESTROYED AMERICAN PUT DONAL TRUMP WAS NOT THE MURDERER BAROKOBOMAL WAS THE MURDER DONAL TRUMP IS THE CORONER WHO STUMBLED ON THE BODY AND DECLARTED DEAD O CAN MEANWHILE WE ARE STILL EXPERIENCEING FALL OUT FROM THIS OHIO VOTE SO THERE IS A VOTE IN OHIO TO ESSENTUALLY CHANGED THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO ENSHRINE AMENDMENT TO THESTATE CONSTITUTION TO REQUIRE MORE THAN A SIXTY PER CENT A PROVAL TO CHANGE TO STATE CONSTITUTION THAT WAS MEANT TO PREVENT A A SORT OF WALK BACK WITH REGARD TO ABORTION LAW ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO ARE PROBORTION INSTEATE OF OHIO THAT MEASURE FAILED PRETTY DRAMATICALLY AND ONCE AGAIN THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE TO PURSUE VICTORY INCREMENTALLY VERY OFTEN THET IS THAT THIS TENDENCY TIT TO FEEL LIKE HE S GOT A GOFOR BROKE ALL THE TIME GOING FOR BROKE IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL IS ENEMY SUCCESSFUL TACTIC WHAT'S HILARIOUS IS THE DEMOCRATS OF COURSE ARE ABOUT TO BLOW IT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED THAT ACTUALLY THIS DEMODAL FOR TRANS ISSUES THEIR BUNCH OF ARTICLES TODAY SUGGESTING THAT DEMOCRATS LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN OHIO WHICH WAS THE REJECTION OF WHAT EFFECTIVELY WAS SORT OF APRO LIFE BALLAD INITIATIVE THEY LOOK AT THAT THY SAY WHALL THIS MEANS THAT SUDDENLY THE PEOPLE OF OHIR A SOCIALLY LEFT WING NO I MEANS THERE'S A STATUS QUOBIUS AND IT MEANS THAT WHENEVER THERE IS A MUSCULAR ATTEMPT TWO IN SHRINE IN STATE WAW OF YOU A REUGHFERENDAM MORE PROLIFE POSITIONS  PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT BECASE THERE STATUS QUOBIAS AND FOR GOING TO DO IT YOU HAVE TO DO IT GRADUALLY YOEEFVE TO DO IT OVER TIME BUT BOTH SIDES BECAUSE THAT POLLERISATION THERE NO LONGER SEEKING RADUAL SO YOUTHER HAVE NEW YORK WHICH IS SEEKING TO LEGALIZE ABORTION AN S YOU'REGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD OR YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT FARE SEEKING TO BAN ALL ABORTION IN THE TATE NO OBVIS THE HAVE LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR THAT SECOND POSITION THAT'S THE POSITION THAT I HOLD BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK IF YOU CAN'S ACTUALLY WIND O VICTORY IS A NECESSITY HERE AND PUBLICANS SHOULD BE SMART ABOUT HOW THEY PURSUE IT O CAE TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AND THEN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS THAT I LIKE TO DAY SO THERE'S THIS CRAZY CASE IN STOCKDTIN CALIFORNIA WHE'RE TWO STOCKTAN SEVEN ELEVEN CLERKS A TACKED TO WOULD BE THIEF WITH STICKS VIDIA OF THAT JULY TWENTY NINTH ASSAULT AS GAIN NATIONAL ATTENTION IT'S A FIVE MINUTE CLEP THIS GUY

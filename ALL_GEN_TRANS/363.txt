PREMIUM SUBSCRIBER IS FOR YOU SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S GET TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THE FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT COLDS AND FLUES AND THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY IS WHY IS IT THAT WE GET MORE COLDS AN FLUES IN THE WINTER MONTHS IS IT THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE IS AT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MORE TIME IN DOORS OR IS IT A MYTH THAT WE GET MORE COLDS AN FLUES IN THE WINTER MONTHS WELL THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE RESEARCH VERY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT IN WINTER MONTHS THERE IS A GREATER PREVALENTHS OF COLDS AND FLUES NOW OF COURSE THE WORDS IN THE WINTER MONTHS MEANS MANY THINGS FOR INSTANCE IN MOST AREAS OF THE WORLD UNLESS YOU LIVE DIRECTLY NEAR THE EQUATOR IN THE WINTER MONTHS MEANS THAT DAYS ARE GOING TO BE SHORTER AND NIGHTS ARE LONGER THAN IN THE SUMMER MONTHS IN GENERAL THAT'S TRUE IT'S OF COURSE ESPECIALLY TRUE IF YOU LIVE VERY FAR FROM THE EQUATOR SO IMAGINE SOMEBODY LIVING UP IN CHOMSO NORWAY WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO THE NORTH POLE IN WINTER DAYS ARE VERY VERY SHORT IN TROMPS AND CONVERSELY IN THE SUMMER MONTHS DAYS ARE VERY VERY LONG IN TROMPSON NORWAY NOW CHUMPSO NORWAY REPRESENTS AN EXTREME OF DAYLENGTH VARIATION ACCORDING TO TIME OF YEAR THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE EQUATER THE LESS VARIATION THERE IS IN DAY LENGTH AND THEREFORE NIGHT LENGTH ACROSS THE YEAR HOWEVER IN MOST LOCATIONS ON EARTH DAYS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER BY ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO AT LEAST FOR CERTAIN PARTS OF THE YEAR AND IN GENERAL SHORTER DAYS CORELATE WITH COLDER TEMPERATURES THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHICH IS THAT SHORTER DAYS GENERALLY CORRELATE WITH COLDER TEMPERATURES REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE ON THE PLANET EARTH OK SO IN THE WINTER MONTHS AS WERE CALLING IT INVOLVES AT LEAST TWO THINGS SHORTER DAYS WHICH MEANS WHAT IT MEANS LESS SUNLIGHT AND EITHER MORE ARTIFICIAL LIGHT OR MORE DARKNESS DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH ARTIFICIAL LIGHT YOU RELY ON IT ALSO MEANS AS WE MENTION COLDER TEMPERATURES COLDER TEMPERATURES OF COURSE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THOSE COLDER TEMPERATURES BECAUSE WHAT'S THE THIRD THING SHORTER DAYS AND COLDER TEMPERATURES OUTSIDE MEAN THAT PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MORE TIME IN DOORS SO WHAT THE RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS NOT THE ONLY BUT ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE GREATER PREVALENCE OF COLDS AND FLUES IN THE SHORT DAYS A C A WINTER MONTHS OF THE YEAR IS THAT PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MORE TIME INDOORS AND THEREFORE AT CLOSER PROXIMITY WHICH RAISES A WHOLE BUNCH OF REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLORED IN THE PURE REVIEWED RESEARCH ABOUT PROXIMITY COLD AND FLUE TRANSMISSION THERE'E BEEN STUDIES FOR INSTANCE WHERE PEOPLE COME INTO THE LABORATORY WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM COLD AND FLUE AND ARE SNEEZING HAVING THEM SNEEZE AT DIFFERENT PROXIMITY TO OTHER PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS UNDER CONSENT THERE GREEING TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PARTICULAR EXPERIMENTS AND THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A VERY NICE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU THE UNINFECTED PERSON AND THE SNEEZING COUGHING KNOWS WHIPING I WIPING WHILE GET INTO WHY OH I MENTION ALL OF THOSE THINGS IN A MOMENT PERSON THAT IS SUFFERING FROM THE FLUE IN OTHER WORDS THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO SOMEBODY WHO SNEEZING OR COUGHING THE HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT YOU WILL CONTRACT THAT COLD OR FLUE O CASE WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL PHYSICAL PROXIMITY IS A KEY VARIABLE IN TERMS OF TRANSMISSION OF COLD AND FLUE AND IT SOME LEVEL THAT SORT OF A DU MEAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU'RE IN THE NEXT ROOM OR DOWN THE HALLWAY FROM OR CROSS THE STREET FROM SOMEBODY WITH A COLDER FLUE YOU DON'T EXPECT TO CONTRACT THAT COLDER FLUE FROM THEM WHEREAS IF YOU 'RE IN THE SAME VEHICLE WITH THEM OR YOUR SITTING NEXT OF THE MONTONAIR PLANE OR YOU ARE ON THE SAME BOSSER IN THE SAME CLASSRAMIS THEM AND THEY ARE SNEEZING AND COUGHING WELL THEN THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU WOULD GET THAT COLDER FLUE FROM THEM IS INCREASED THAT'S JUST OBVIOUS BUT THE STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL PROXIMITY AND TRANSMISSION OF COLDERND FLUE HAVE ACTUALLY ANALYZED THINGS DOWN TO THE RANGE OF WELL IF YOU'RE STANDING ONE FOOT APART OR YOU'RE STANDING THREE FEET APART OR SIX FEET APART WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU WILL CONTRACT THAT COLDER FLUE AND IT FOLLOWS A VERY DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WHERE THE CLOSE OF THE PROXIMITY THE MORE LIKELY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTRACT THE COLDER FLUE FROM THAT PERSON AND OF COURSE ANYTHING LIKE EXCHANGE OF SKIN CONTACT OR EXCHANGE OF SALIVA BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IN CASES OF ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WHERE PEOPLE WILL KISS OR IN FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS OR FRIENDSHIPS WERE PEOPLE HUG ANY KIND OF CONTACT ALSO FURTHER INCREASES THE TRANSMISSION OF COLD AND FLUE NOT JUST FROM STUFF EMITTED FROM THE NAZAL PASSAGES AND FROM THE MOUTH WHEN PEOPLE SNEEZING COUGH BUT ALSO WHEN PEOPLE WIPE THEIR EYES EVEN WHEN PEOPLE WIPE THEIR SKIN BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THEY HAVE COLD OR FLU VIRUS ON THEIR SKIN IT DOESN'T ALWAYS SURVIVE TERRIBLY LONG ON THE SKIN BUT IF THEY WIPE THEIR FACE OR WIPE THEIR NOSE OR ARE USING TISSUES AND THEN DON'T WASH THEIR HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTERWARDS INDEED THEY CAN TRANSMIT COLD AND FLUE SIMPLY THROUGH HANDSHAKE O CASESO FOR ALL YOU HYPOCONDRACTS OUT THERE I'M ARMING YOU WITH A LOT OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL JUSTIFY STAYING AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS HAVE COLD AND FLUE NOW THIS PARTICULAR POINT ABOUT PROXIMITY AND PEOPLE BEING INDOORS MORE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S MORE COLD AND FLUE TRANSMISSION RAISES A WHOLE BUNCH OF INTERESTING QUESTIONS AND IN FACT PROTOCOLS THAT I PLAN TO COVER IN A HUBERBAN LAB PODCAST EPISODE SOLELY DEVOTED TO COLDS IN FLUES AND HOW TO AVOID GETTING COLDS AND FLUES BUT ONE BRIEF MENTION OR TELEGRAPH OF WHAT I PLAN TO COVER IN THAT EPISODE IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU THAT THEY ARE SNEEZING AND COUGHING DUE TO A COLD OR FLUE BUT THAT THEY ARE QUOTENQUOTE NOT CONTAGIOUS EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE EARLY IN THE COLD OR FLUE OR LATE IN THE COLD OR FLUE AND THEY HAVE THESE THEORIES OR CLAIMS THAT OH AND A'M NO LONGER CONTAGIOUS A KEEP IN MIND THAT ANY TIME SOME ONE IS SNEEZING OR COUGHING THEY ARE IN FACT CONTAGIOUS SO I'LL GET BACK TO THAT IN THAT FUL LENGTH EPISODE ABOUT COLDS AND FLUES BUT I FELT IT WAS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO MENTION RIGHT NOW THAT PEOPLE'S THEORIES ABOUT WHEN THEY ARE COD AND CUOTE CONTAGIOUS OR NOT CONTAGIOUS ARE RARELY SUBSTANTIATED BY THE ACTUAL DATA THE ACTUAL DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE SNEEZING AND COUGHING IF IT'S DUE TO A COLD OR FLUE THEY ARE STILL CONTAGIOUS O CASO WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT COLD OUTSIDE MEANS PEOPLE TEND TO BE INDOORS MORE WHICH INCREASES PHYSICAL PROXIMITY WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE'S MORE COLD AND FLUE TRANSMISSION ONE OF THE OTHER REASONS WHY BEING ENDOORS M ORE TENDS TO INCREASE COLD AND FLUE TRANSMISSION IS THAT IN THE COLD MONTHS OF WINTER WHEN  PEOPLE ARE IN DOORS THEY TEND TO BE NOT UNDER AIR CONDITIONING NOT AT NEUTRAL TEMPERATURES BUT RATHER THEY TEND TO BE IN HEATED ROOMS AND DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF HEATING THAT'S USED BUT IN GENERAL DUE TO ALL FORMS OF HEATING THE HEATED AIR TENDS TO BE DRYER AIR NOW THIS IS A LITTLE BIT COUNTER INTUITIVE BECAUSE IF YOU EVER GO OUTSIDE ON A REALLY COLD WINTER DAY YOU WILL REALIZE THAT THE COLD WEATHER OUTDOORS IS EXTREMELY DRY YOU CAN ALMOST KOTNFEEL THE DRYNESS OF THE AIR AND IF YOU CAN'T UOTENK FEEL THE DRYNESS OF THE AIR OR IMAGINE WHAT THAT'S LIKE JUST IMAGINE THIS THINK OF YOURSELF OUTDOORS ON A VERY COLD WINTER DAY TAKING A BRISK WALK THEN THINK ABOUT YOURSELF TAKING THAT SAME BRISK WALK ON A VERY HUMID SUMMER DAY HUMIDITY IS OF COURSE THE CONCENTRATION OF WATER IN THE AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT THE AIR WHEREAS THE DRYNESS IS THE LACK OF HUMIDITY AND JUST THAT LITTLE SIMPLE GADUNKAN OR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT WILL REMIND YOU JUST HOW DRY THE COLD AIR IS OUT OF DOORS DURING THE WINTER MONTHS WHEREAS INDOORS WERE HEATING THAT AIR AND INDEED THE HEATING OF THAT AIR DOES HAVE THE PROPERTY OF DRYING THE NASAL AND ORAL PASSAGES BUT ESPECIALLY THE NASAL PASSAGES SO ANOTHER KEY REASON WHY THERE'S MORE TRANSMISSION OF COLDS AND FLUES IN THE WINTER MONTHS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MORE TIME INDOORS AND OFTENTIMES THE WAY THOSE INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS ARE BEING HEATED IS DRYING OUT THE NASAL PASSAGES AND THE NASAL PASSAGES REPRESENT A PRIMARY SIHT OF DEFENCE FOR VIRAL INFECTIONS LIKE COLDS AND FLUES BUT ALSO BACTERIAL INFECTIONS AND FUNGL INFECTIONS FOR THAT MATTER NOW I'VE TALK BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF USING NASAL BREATHING UNDER ANY CONDITIONS WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BREATHE THROUGH YOUR MOUTH SO IF YOU ARE NOT EATING IF YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING OR IF YOU'RE NOT EXERCISING HARD WHICH BY THE WAY OFTENTIMES REQUIRES THAT YOU BREATH THROUGH YOUR MOUTH THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BREATHING THRUGH YOUR MOUTH IF YOUR EXERCISE AND HEART AND YOU NEED TO BREAT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH IN ORDER TO BRING IN ENOUGH OXAGEON THERE ARE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THAT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE PODCAST EPISODE I DID ALL ABOUT BREATHING AND BREATHWORK BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S BEST TO BE A NASAL BREATHER EXCEPT UNDER THE CONDITIONS I JUST MENTION WHY WELL THE NASAL PASSAGES CONTAIN A NUMBER OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS INCLUDING THE HAIRS WITHIN YOUR NOSE I KNOW THAT HAIRS IN THE NOSE A ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE SUPERNUMEROUS ARE NOT CONSIDERED ESTHETICALLY NICE A PEOPLE WILL TRIM THEM AT CETERA BUT THOSE HAIRS IN YOUR NOSE ACTUALLY SERVE AS A BARRIER TOWARD INFECTION THIS IS WELL ESTABLISHED THE LINING OF THE NOSE THE MUCOSAL LINING OF THE NOSE CONTAINS A LOT OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT ACTSES ITS OWN PHYSICAL BARRIER AND PHYSICAL TRAP FOR INCOMING VIRUS'S FUNGL INFECTIONS AND MACTERIAL INFECTIONS THEY LITRELY GET TRAP IN THE NASAL PASSAGES AND THEREFORE CAN'T ENTER DEEPER INTO YOUR PHYSIOLOGY AND RIGHT NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO GO INTO THE HOLE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE NASAL PASSAGES BUT KEEP IN MIND IF YOU SAW THE EPISODE THAT I DID WITH NOMESOBAL OR YOU LISTENT THE EPISODE HAT I DID ON ALL FACTION BOTH OF THOSE EPISODES IGH LIKE THE FACT THAT YOUR BRAIN SITS NOT FAR BEHIND YOUR NASAL PASSAGES THERE'S A A BONY BARRIER THERE CALLED THE CRUPERFORM PLATE AND THERE SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL BUT IT'S NOT FAR FROM YOUR NOSTRILS TO YOUR BRAIN AND IT IS NOT FAR FROM YOUR NOSTRILS TO THE REST OF YOUR RESTIPRATORY PATHWAY OF COURSE AND SO THE HAIRS OF YOUR NOSTRILS THE MUCUS ITSELF AND THE MICROBIUM THE TRILLIANS OF LITTLE MICROBACTERIA THAT THRIVE IN THE MUCOSAL LINING OF YOUR NASAL PASSAGES ACTUALLY SERVE TO PROTECT AGAINST MANY OF THE INCOMING INFECTIONS THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP THEM MUCOSAL LINING OF YOUR NASAL PASSAGES THRIVING AND INTACT HOW DO YOU DO THAT WELL ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AIR THAT YOUR BREATHING IS SUFFICIENTLY HUMITIFIED SO WHILE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT CLAIMS OUT THERE ABOUT HOW TO AVOID COLDS AND FLUES AS LONG ASYOU ERE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHY THERE ARE MORE COLDS AN F ES IN THE WINTER MONTHS BECAUSE INDEED THERE ARE IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT IF YOU SUFFER FROM COLDS AND FLUES AND YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN PARTICULAR INDUOR ENVIRONMENT YOU MIGHT BE WISE TO FIND A EIR HUMIDIFIRE SOMETHING THAT BRINGS MORE MOISTURE INTO THE AIR THAT YOUR BREATHING ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING NOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO PREVENT THE PERSON IN YOUR ENVIRONMEN WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE A COLDOR FLUE AND IS SNEEZING ACTIVELY FROM TRANSMITTING THAT COLDOR FLUE BUT IT WILL KEEP YOUR NASAL PASSAGES AND THE REST OF YOUR RESPIRATORY PATHWAYS AS HEALTHY AS THEY CAN BE AND AS RESYSTANT AS THEY CAN BE TO ANY COLDS OR FLUES THAT YOU MIGHT BE FIGHTING OFF AND THIS IS ANOTHER KEY POINT WHICH IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOTS THE WINTER MONTHS FOR THE OTHER MONTHS OF THE YEAR ALL DAY LONG YOUR COMBATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFECTIONS DIFFERENT TYPES OF VIRAL FUNGAL AND BACTURIAL INFECTIONS ARE BOMBARDING YOUR SYSTEM IN YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM COUNTERS THAT BOT THROUGH PHYSICAL AND THROUGH NURROW CHEMICAL AND HORMONAL AND PURE IMMUNE MECHANISMS HERE THERE'S A WHOLE DISCUSSION OF THIS IN THE EPISO THAT DID ON THE OMIUNE SYSTEM WILL DO MORE ON THIS BUT KEEPING THE AIR THAT YOU BREATHE ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT SUFFICIENTLY HUMINIFIED IS ONE GREAT WAY TO TRY AN OFFSET COLDS AND FLUES THAT YOU MIGHT BE COMBATING BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT THAT COLD OR FLUE HOME FROM WORK AND YOUR MUN SYSTEM NEEDS TO WARD IT OFF EH IF YOU OUR HAVING A HARDTIME GRASPING HOW IT IS THAT YOU COULD BRING HOME A COLDOR FLUE AND THEN WARD IT OFF AT YOU HAVE IT YOU NOT HAVE T IS SITTING THERE TRYING TO GET INTO YOUR SYSTEM OR YOU HAVE IT A LITTLE BIT WELL THIS IS SOME OF THE GRAAREA AROUND COLD AND FLUE AND VIRAL TRANSMISSION GENERALLY WE DON'T KNOW FOR INSTANCE IF YOU GOT A MILD SNIFFLE AS OPPOSED TO A REALLY BAD COLD OR FLUE WHETHER NOT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY BAD COLDOR FLUE HAD YOU SLEPT LESS HAD YOU NOT HUMITIFIED YOUR AIR BETTER ET CETERA PROBABLY IT WOULD BE IF YOU'VE EVER NOT SLEPT WELL FOR A LITTLE BIT AND YOUR SICK YOU EXPERIENCE JUST HOW MUCH WORSE THAT SICKNESS FEELS THE SYMPTOMS OF THAT SICKNESS GO FROM VERY MILD TO MODERAT OR FROM MILED TO MODERATES OF VERY SEVERE WHEN YOU ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED THAT SAID IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT SOME STRAINS OF THE COLDER FLUE CAN BE MORE MILD THAN OTHER STRAINS OF THE COLDER FLUE SO THIS CAN BE PRETTY NUANTS AND WILL GO DEEPER INTO THIS IN THE EPISO THAT I DO ON COLD AND FLE AND HOW TO AVOID COLD AND FLUE BUT NASAL BREATHING WHENEVER POSSIBLE DAY AND NIGHT TIME IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR ENCOURAGING THE OVER ALL HEALTH AND RESISTANCE OF YOUR RESPIRATORY PATHWAYS TO INCOMIND COLD AND FLUE AND OTHER TYPES OF VIRISES SIMILARLY HUMIDIFYING THE AIR THAT YOU BREATHE ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT BUT PERHAPS ALSO DURING THE DAY IN YOUR OFFICE ENVIRONMENTS OR HOME ENVIRONMENT CAN ALSO BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR WARDING OFF COLDS AND FLUES ANDIF YOU LIKE TO READ MORE ABOUT THE NAZSAL VERSES MOUTH BREATHING COMPONENTS OF COLDS AR FLUES JUST MENTION ONE PAPER NOW AND AGAIN I'LL GO INTO THIS AND MORE DEPTH THAN THE FUTURE EPISODE ON COLDS AND FLUES BUT I WANT A MENTION THAT THIS IS A BY DIRECTIONAL EFFACT MEANING PEOPLE WHO DELIBERATELY BREATHE THROUGH THEIR NOSE TEND TO GET FEWER COLDS AND FLUES ALSO PEOPLE WHO TEND TO BREATHE THROUGH THEIR MOUTH MORE TEND TO GET MORE COLDS AND FLUES NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THAT'S THE SAME THING ORE JUST TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN BUT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT THERE'S WHAT WE CALL A DOUBLE DISSOCIATION WHEREBY IF PEOPLE ARE MOUTH BREATHERS THEY ARE FAR MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS AND FLUES AND OTHER TYPES OR RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES I'LL PUT A LINK TO ONE PARTICULAR PAPER THAT I LIKE A LOT IN THE SHOWNO CAPTIONS ENTITLED ASSOCIATION OF ORL BREATHING WITH DENTAL MOUCLUSIONS AND GENERAL HEALTH IN CHILDREN THIS PAPER EXPLORES A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT NASAL VERS'S MOUTH BREATHING ALL OF WHICH BY THE WAY POINT TO THE FACT THAT NAZAL BREATHING WHENEVER POSSIBLE IS BETTER FOR US HEALTH WISE ESTHETICALLY DENTAL HEALTH WISE THAN IS MOUTH BREATHING BUT ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS HERE N THIS IS WHY BRING IT UP IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION IS QUOTE ORL BREATHING IS RELATED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PREVALENCE OF ALIGIES AND A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY GETTING SICK END TAKING MEDICATION FOR BEING SICK SO LOTS IN THIS STUDY LOTS IN RELATED STUDIES BUT NONE THE LESS BEING A NASAL BREATHER OU MITIFYING YOUR AIR PAYING ATTENTION TO WHETHER NOT YOUR INDOORS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE COUGHING AND SNEEZING BECAUSE IT'S COLD OUTSIDE ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE RELEVANT PERHAPS KEEPING A LITTLEBIT OF DISTANCE MAY BE A LOT OF DISTANCE FROM THOSE PEOPLE OR ENCOURAGING THEM TO WASH THEIR HANDS AFTER THEY WIPE THEIR NOS MAYBE EVEN SENDING THEM TO A LITTLE BIT OF A NOT NECESSARILY ISOLATION ALTHOUGH THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY BUT KEEPING THEM AT A DISTANCE RIGHT I DON'T THINK IT'S A TOO MUCH TO ASK SOMEBODY WHO SICK TO NOT GET YOU SICK A PERSONALLY I THINK THAT'S THE POLITE THING TO TRY AND DO AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A NOT MANY THINGS RUDER THAN SOME ONE WHO KNOWS THAT THEY'RE SICK SHOWING UP TO SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MISS THAT PARTICULAR EVENT IN GETTING EVERYO YELL SICK FRANKLY THAT'S MY OPINION I THINK A THAT OPINION IS SHARED WITH MANY OF YOU OUT THERE AS WELL NOW AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE THE AIR TENDS TO BE DRY OR NOT ALWAYS EMMAN YOU COULD LIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S VERY COLD AND VERY RAINY OBVIOUSLY VERY RAINY IS VERY HUMAD IT'S MAXIMUM HUMIDITY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND TIME OUT OF DOORS IN COLD DAYS OF WINTER WHICH BY THE WAY IS A REALLY GOOD THING FOR OTHER REASONS I'LL GET INTO THOSE REASONS IN A MOMENT BECAUSE THEY RELATE DIRECTLY TO WHY THERE SUCH A PREVALENCE OF COLDS AND FLUES BECAUSE IN GENERAL PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU TO DO BUT THERE'RE TOO THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUT OF DOORS FIRST OF ALL ALL THE THINGS ABOUT PROXIMITY STILL HOLD RIGHT THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE COLDS AND FLUES SNEEZING IN INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS VORSES OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS AND HOW MUCH TRANSMISSION THERE IS AGAIN IT BOILS DOWN TO PROXIMITY YES YOU CAN GET A COLD OR FLUE FROM SOMEBODY SNEEZING OUT OF DOORS NEXT TO YOU JUST AS WELL AS YOU CAN IF THEY SNEEZE NEXT YOU INDOORS SA SLIGHTLY HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT YOU'LL GET IT FROM THEM IF THERE SNEEZING AT THAT SAME DISTANCE BUT YOUR INDOORS AS SUPPOSE TO OUTDOORS OBVIOUSLY SNEEZERS COFFERS SNEEZING COUGH IN THE OTHER DIRECTION COVER YOUR MOUTH AND KNOS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TISSUE OR SOMETHING WE ARE TOLD AND I SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEA THAT SNEEZING INTO YOUR ELBOW ER COUGHING INTO YOUR EL LBOW IS PROBABLY THE NEXT BEST THING TO NOT COVERING UP AT ALL AM AS SUPPOSED TO INTO YOUR HAND WHICH THAN YOU TOUCH OTHER THINGS AND YOURSELF ANYWAY WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE MECHANICS OF SNEEZING AND COUGHING TOO DEEPLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUTSIDE IN THE COLD WINTER MONTHS AND YOU LIKE TO AVOID GETTING COLDS AND FLUES WHEN YOU RUN WHEN YOU EXERCISE WHEN YOU WALK WHEN YOU'RE IN CONVERSATION TRY TO NASAL BREATHE UNLESS YOU HALFE TO MOUTH BREATHE AND IF YOU CAN SENSE YOUR NASAL PASSAGES OR YOUR MOUTH DRYING OUT BECAUSE OF THAT HARD BREATHING AND BY THE WAY EXERCISE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS IS STILL IMPORTANT SO I'M NOT DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM EXERCISING OUT DOORS DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AS LONG AS YOU CAN DO IT SAFELY BUT IF YOU FEEL THOSE AIR PASSAGES DRAWING OUT JUST BE AWARE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE THOSE DRIED OUT AIR PASSAGES INDOORS AND YOURE AROUND OTHER PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE COLDS AND FLUES YOU ARE GOING TO BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE SO THAT'S CAUSE FOR TAKING A HOT SHOWER PERHAPS IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A STEAM ROOM OR HUMID IFIRE AND REHIDRATING THOSE NASAL AND ORAL PASSAGES NOW IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE AND RUNNING AND YOU'RE BREATHING HARD AND YOUR NASAL PASSAGES ARE DRAWING OUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU'RE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS AND FLUES THAT ARE JUST OUT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT IF NO ONE ELSE IS AROUND CHANCES ARE NO HOWEVER WHAT WE WERE ALL TOLD WHEN WE WERE KIDS WHICH IS IF YOU GO OUTSIDE AND YOU GET A CHILL IT'S A GOOD IDEA WHEN YOU COME BACK INSIDE TO TAKE A HOT SHOWER OR HOT BATH OR IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IT ASSAUNA TO HEAT BACK UP THAT'S ALSO TRUE WHY WELL IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COOR BODY TEMPERATURE AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO COLD AND FLUEAND THIS IS SOMETHING OMING TO GO DEEPLY INTO IN THE EPISODE ON COLDS AND FLUES KEEP IN MIND THAT FEVERS THAT ARE THE RESPONSE TO EXPOSURE TO A COLD OR FLUE OR BEING FULL BLOWN SICK WITH A COLD AND FLUE ARE AN ATTEMPT OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO HEAT UP THAT VIRUS AND DESTROY IT KEEP THAT IN MIND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING TAKING ANY KIND OF MEDICATION TO LOWER YOUR FEVER OF COURSE KNOW THAT HIGHLY ELEVATED BODY TEMPERATURES ACA FEVER CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS TO THE BRAIN AND BODY E THERE'S A FAIRLY LIMITED UPPER RANGE OF TEMPERATURES THAT WE CAN GO INTO BEFORE WE START DAMAGING OURSELVES BUT ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT FEVER IS AN ADAPTATION DESIGN TO DESTROY VIRUSES ICAS SO IF YOU BLUNT THE FEVER YOU ARE ACTUALLY LETTING A COLD OR VIRUS TO PRELIFERATE MORE READILY THAN IT WOULD IF YOU ALLOWED A SLIGHT FEVER TO COMBAT THAT IN CASE SO THERE TH WHOLE DISCUSSION TO BE HAD THERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLYO DON'T WANT PEOPLE COOKING THEIR BRAINS DO TO ELEVATED FEVER AND NOT TREATING THAT FEVER BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO REDUCE YOUR COR BODY TEMPERATURE TOO MUCH WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION OF THINGS LIKE COLD PLUNGES SHOULD YOU BE TAKING COLD SHOWERS AND DOING COLD PLUNGES IN THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN IT'S ALREADY COLD AND YOU'RE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS AND MAYBE YOUARE COMING DOWN WITH E COLD SHOULD YOU DO THAT AH WELL THAT SEDWAYS INTO THE NEXT QUESTION THAN I'M GOINGT ANSWER FOR THE A M A WHICH RELATES DIRECTLY TO COLD EXPOSURE AND SO CALL THE SICLIC HY PREVENTILLATION BREATHING SOMETIMES ASSOCIATE WITH SO CALL THE WHIM HOFF BREATHING BUT OTHER FORMS OF DELIBERATE BREATHING AS WELL AND HOW SPECIFIC FORMS OF DELIBERATE BREATHING AND HOW DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN INDEED BE USED TO OFFSET OR EVEN PREVENT ENTIRELY INFECTION DUE TO BACTERIAL OR VIRUSES BUT IF YOU'RE ALREADY COMING DOWN WITH A BACTERIAL OR VIRAL INFECTION WHY SICLI CYPEROVENTILATION BREATHING OR WHY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE MAY ACTUALLY BE THE WORST THING IF YOU ARE ALREADY CONTRACTING OR IF CONTRACTED IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING OR HAVE ALREADY CONTRACTED A COLD OR VIRUS SO WILL ANSWER THAT QUESTION NEXT IN THE MEANTIME JUST KNOW THAT YES INDEED IN THE WINTER MONTHS YOU ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS AND FLUES BECAUSE THERES MORE OF THEM GOING AROUND WE TALK ABOUT SOME THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE GOING AROUND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST THOSE COLDS AND FLUES THERE ARE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT ARE VERY VALUABLE THAT WILL EXPLORE IN THE FULL LENGTH EPISODE ON COLDS AND FLUES AND HOW TO AVOID GETTING THEM AND I'M HOPING YOU ALL STAY CLEAR OF COLDS AND FLUES THESE WINTER MONTHS AND NOW YOU HVE SOME TOOLS TO TRY AND REDUCE THE DURATION AN SEVERITY THOSE COLDS AND FLUES SHOULD YOU GET ONE THANK YOU FOR JOINING FOR THE BEGIN

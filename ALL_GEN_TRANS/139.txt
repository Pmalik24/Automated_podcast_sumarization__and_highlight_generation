CONGRESS OFVERTS A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE REPRESENTATIVE GEMAL BOMEN PULLS A FIRE ALARM TO DELAY THE VOTE AND REPRESENTATIVE MATGATES THRETENS KEVEN MCCARTHY'S SPEAKERSHIP I'M BENCHFER THIS IS THE BENCHVIROSHO THE BENSHVIR SHOS GONTOR BAEXPRESSVPIEN PRETECT YOUR OLINE PRIVACY TODAY EXPRESS VEPIANDICOMS LASH MEN AREATY SO IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN OVER THE WEEKEND IT WAS AVERTED AT THE VERY LASS MINUTE MAINLY BECAUSE CEVEN MOCARTHY DECIDED THA WHO'SE GON TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT WE CALL A CLEAN CONTINUING RESOLUTION TICKS ABOUT FORTY FIVE DAYS TINTO THE FUTURE TAKES US INTO NOVEMBER TIT S DIS NOT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE CRANE WAR THE SENATE THEN QUICKLY PASS THAT AND THEN IT WAS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT BIDNESS HAPPEN BOUT THREE HOURS BEFORE A SHUT DOWN WAS SET TO TAKE EFFECT THE DEMOCRATS OBVIOUSLY DID NOT WANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF DEEP ABIDING FIGHT OVER YOU CRANE FUNDING IN THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TOTE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SAY THE REASON FOR HAVING THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE WE MEED EXBILLION DOLLARS MOR FOR THE CRANE WAR AGAIN THE SENTIMENTS AGAINST THE AMERICAN FUNDING OF THE CRANE WAR IS GROWING AND GROWING MAINLY BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS NEVER PRESENTED A PLAN FOR ANY SORT OF OFFRAMP TIF YOU ACTUALLY WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BACKA PLAN WOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN BUT TE BY DEMENSTRATION HASS NO PLAN DEMOCRATS IN ONE TO HAVE THE DOBAY PUBLICLY NOW THE REASON THAT THIS DEAL ENDED UP GETTING DONE IN THE WAY THT GOT DON IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A WING OH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT ACTUALLY SCUTTLED A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER DO JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THE REPUBLICANS WERE GOING TO PASS A HOUSE RESOLUTION THAT WOULD PROVIDED FOR CONTINUING FUNDING FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD HAVE AMOUNTED TO AN EIGHT PER CENT CUT IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT EXT NUMBER OF MONTHS AND NOT ONLY WOULD INCLUDIN EHT PER CENT CUT TO OULD ALSO INCLUE BORE SECURITY MEASURES AND FOR SOME REASON THAT NO ONE CAN DISCERN MATGATES AND COMPANY ON THE RIGHT WING OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCAS DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO NOT VOTE FOR THAT THEY WANTED MORE THEY WANTED NO SPENDING WHATSOEVER THEY WON'T GOING TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS THAT THEY DID WANT OR WHAT THEY THOUGHT COULD PASS THE SENATE INSTEAD THEYE WERE JUST GOING TO STAND THERE AND SHOUT NO AT CEVEN MC CARTHY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE I WENN'T UNDERSTAND WIR SHOUTING AT HIM LIKE WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK HE CAN DO HES A DEMOCRATIC SENATE AND A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTE HE ALREADY ONE ONE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN TO BATE WITH JOBIDEN BECAUSE JOBIDON LIKE A FOOL CAME OUT AND SEGGESTED THAT WH WAS NOT ON A NEGOTIATE WHATSOEVER OVERSPENDING ANDTHEN HE ANDED UP CAVING AND MCARTHY GOT SOME FUNDING CUTS AROUND THE EDGES WHEL THE SAME THING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE MC CARTHY WAS GOIN TO PASS A BILT THAT INCLUDING EIGHT PER CENT DISCRETIONARY FUNDING CUT AND BOR SECURITY MEASURES THWASE THEN GEN TO GO TO THE SENATE TAND DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO BE FORCED TO ARGUE THAT THEY WOULD RATHER THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN THAN THAT THESE CUTS BE ALLOWED OR THAT BORE SECURITY BE ALOWED AGAIN WRONG FOOTING DEMOCRATS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO WIN FUTURE HOUSE ELECTIONS INSTEAD THE RIGHT WING OF THE CAUCAS AGAIN ALL IT TAKES IS A COUPLE OF VOTES FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO LOSE THEIR MAJORITY ON ANY VOTE BECASE THE ONLY HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE VOTES IN THE ACTUAL HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES THEY CAN ONLY IF FORE TO LOSE ABOUT FOUR VOTES AND STILL PASS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION BY MAJORITY VOTE AND SO THAT GOT SCUTTLED AND INSTEAD A WORST EAL GOT TON AND THEN THAT WORSTEAL IS BEING USED IS WE'LL SEE IN SECOND BY MAGATES TO SUGGEST THAT KEVEN MC CARTHY OUGHT TO BE OUSTED FROM THE SPEAKERSHIP SO AS BASICALLY A CATCH TWENTY TWO THE GAITES WAS SETTING UP FOR MAC CARTHY HE WASN'T GOING TO PASS A BETTER VERSION OF THE BILL FOR SOME UNSPECIFIED REASON BECAUSE MC CARTHY WAS A SELL OUT AND THEN WHEN WORSE VERSION OF THE BILL GETS PASS THAN ITS BECAUSE MAC CARTHY IS A SELL OUT IN ANY CASE ACCORDING TOTHE WALSTER TURNAL THE HOUSE VOTED THREE THIRTY FIVE TO NINETY ONE FOR THE MEASURE EXCEEDING THE TWO THIRDS MAJORITY NEEDED TO CLEAR THE BILL WHICH WAS CONSIDERED UNDER SPECIAL PRECEDURES REQUIRING A SUPER MAJORITY O VOTES ALL BUT ONE DEMOCRAT VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE MEASURE WHILE NEARLY HALF OF REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST IT SEVERAL HOURS LATER THE SENAT VOTED EIGHTY  EIGHTY EIGHT TO NINE TO PASS THE LEGISLATION AND THEN JOBIDONS SIGNED THE MEASURE THIS PRISES BREAK THROUGH UP ENDED EXPECTATIONS CONGRESS WAS TWO DIVIDED S PASS ANYTHING IN TIME TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT FROM PARTIALLY SHUTTING DOWN AT TWELVE ONE AM ON SUNDAY HOWSE DEMOCRATS INITIALLY WERE SUSPICIOUS OF THE PROPOSAL AND STALLED FOR TIN AS WELL TALK BOUN JUST THE SECOND ON OF THE PRECEDURES FOR STALLING FOR TIME INVOLVED ACTIVELY PULLING A FIRE ALARM IN ORDER TO CREATE SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY PROTOCAL RESPONSE TO DELAY THE VOTE ON THE SENATE SIDE ANGER OVER THE MOVE TO PULL U CRAN A LED TO A NERVE RACKING DINNER TIME AT DELAY THE MEASURE INCLUDE SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN DISASTERELIEF IT O MITS ASSISTANCE FOR U CRANE IT EXCLUDES BORD SECURITY MEASURES SOUGHT BY REPUBLICANS AND A RENEWS THE EXPIRING FOODING CHURS PROGRAM THROUGH NOVEMBER

HE WAS GOING TO DO WAS GOIN TO WORK OR HE'S A MORUNGS HE DOESN'T O HO FIRE ALARMS WORK LET ME EXPLAIN SO AS THIS VOTE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE HE APPARENTLY PULLED A FIRE ALARM IN A CAPITAL OFFICE BUILDING ON SATURDAY WE DON'T EY LAY WHAT SO APPARENTLY A SECURITY GRAT VIDIO WAS DISTRIBUTED TO OFFERS THEY COULD FINED THE PERSON WHO PULLED THE EVIDI ALARM SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT WHOTH SAYS Y THAT'S THAT'S JAL MALMAN STANDING DIRECTLY BEHIND A TIME THAT SAYS EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY HE A INSTEAD OF WALKING THROUGH THE TUNNELS OR TUNNELS THAT CONNECTS AT THE VARIOUS OFFICE BUILDINGS ON ON THE HELL INSTEAD OF WALKING THROUGH THE TUNNELS HE HE WALKS OVER TO A FIRE ALARM AND HE PULLS THE FIRE ALARM REPRESENT IM GEMAL BOMAN PLLE THE FIRE ALARM IN CANNON THIS MORNING AN COUNT CONTROL BY REPUBLICANS ON THE COMMITTEE IT'SE AN INVESTIGATION IS WHY HE PULLED IT IS UNDER WAY THERE WAS OM THERE'S A RESOLUTION THAT IS NOW CIRCULATING TO EXPEL BOMAN FROM THE HOUSE OVER THE INCIDENT WI THET THE IDEA OF PULLING THE FIRE ALARM ERERS TO DELAY A VOTE IS INSANE TODAY AT TWELVE OR FIVE P MA FIREALARM AS ACTIVATED ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE CANNON OFFICE BUILDING A CAPITAL POLICE BOKES PERSON SAID THE BILDING WAS EVACUATED WHILE U S C P OFFICERS CHECK THE BUILDING THE BILDING WAS REOPENED AFTER WAS DETERMINEDTHERE WIS NOT A THREAD  INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY CONTINUES DEMOCRATS WERE

GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVES O HE HAS TO GO I URGE YOU TO LOOK AT THE CONSTITUENCY OF THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH HIS DEMOCRAT THANKS TO THE PERSONAL INTERVENTION OF DONALD TRUMP IN THE GEORGIA SENTAT RACAS AND THE PRESIDENCY WHICH IS RUN BY TROBIDIN BECAUSE DONAL TRUMP LOST TO HIM THOSE WOULD BE THE PLACES TO LOOK IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW FAR CAN YOU CUT THE GOVERNMENT SUCCESSFULLY AND THE ANSWERIS NOT PARTICULARLY VARS SINCE YOU DON'T RUN THE SENATE ANDYU ALSO A ROUN THE PRESIDENCY AND ALSO I SEEM NOT TO REMEMBERMACGATES BEING PATICULARLY VOCAL ABOUT CUTTING SPENDING WHEN DONAL TRUM WAS THE PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICANS CONTROLLE THE SENATE I REMEMBER HIM A TEMPTING TO SHOT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER SPENDING PROTOCAL WHEN IT WAS AN ENTIRELY REPUBLICAN CONGRESS AND REPUBLICAN

ON YOU CRANE SO AS HE WAS BATING REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR A CONTINUING RESOLUTION WITHOUT YOU CRANE MONEY SAYING THAT WE WERE GOING T JAM THE SENATE ON YOU CRANE HE THEN TURNS AROUND AND MAKES A SECRET DEAL NOW I KNOW YOU AND I PROBABLY HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON YOU AS INVOLVEIN A NOU CRANE BUT HOWEVER YOU THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTION IT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO OPEN REVIEW ANALYSIS AND NOT SOME BACKROOM DEAL SO I VOT A ECATE TO MORROW I DO INTEND TO FILE A MOTION O VACATE AGAINST SPEAKER MC CARTHY THIS WEEK I THINK WE NEED TO AS RIP OFF THE BANDADE I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE ON WITH NEW LEADERSHIP HE SO WHAT IS THAT LEADERSHIP HE WON'T SAY SO HE'S ASKED SO WHO BE THE SPEAKER IF IF YOU GET RID MC CARTHY WHO TAKES OVER FOR HIM AN MAGETES S LIKE RHOM IF YOU SOMEHOW SUCCEED AFTER MULTIBLE TRASSITY WHO WOULD BE THE SPEAKER I WE HAVE A LOT IT LOOK WE HAVE A LOT OF TOUNTS OF PEOPLE ON OUR CONFERENCE OBVIOUSLY IT'S IT'S A IT'S AN AWKWARD DISCUSSION WHILE OUR NUMBER TWO STEEV SCOLEESAS IN TREATMENT FOR BLOOD CANCER SOTS I'M NOT GON TO PASS SOMEBODY OVER BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTNG A MEDICAL TREATMENT I WANT TOD I WANT TO SEE HOW STEEV SCOLEES COMES OUT OF THAT UM SO STEEVESCLEYS IS NOT GOING TO BE DE GUI HE ALREADY DOES NOT WANT TO BE THE GUI HE HIS SAID THAT REPEATEDLY GATE SAYS THIS IS IN PERSONAL BY THE WAY THIS ALL BASED ONE PRINCIPLE WHICH I FIND HARD TO BELIEVE CONSIDERING TIT HE VOTED WITH DOWN ON FROM IS POSITION IN ONE HUNDRED SENTIN CONGRESS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TINE LITERAL LY ONE HUNDRED PRESENT WHICH INCLUDES TPRESUMABLY ALL OF DONE FROM BIG BUT YEUR BLOW OUT AN WA HERS MATGATES TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS IN PERSONAL ABOUT MACCARTHY WELL IT MATTER OF FACT JUST COUP LA WEEKS AGO GOVERNMENT CART THE APPOINTED ME TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON THE ND E EH AND WE SPOKE ABOUT SOME OF OUR A LINE TO DEFENSE PRIORITIES SO THIS ISN'T PERSONAL SOME PEOPLE MAKE POLICY DISAGREEMENTS PERSONAL BECAUSE THEIR OWN POLICY FAILURES ARE SO PERSONALLY EMBARRASSING TO THEM I HOLD NO PERSONAL ANIMIS TO ANY WITH ANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES BOTHER INCLUDING MY RE PUBLICAN COLLEGUERE ABOUT TO HAVE ON NEXT WHOS HAT'S A PRETTY TURSE WORDS FOR ME BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT SPENDING THIS IS ABOUT THE DEAL CEAVEN MADE IN JANUARY AGAIN IT IT REALLY ISN'T IT REALLY ISN'T YE SO THEN GATES SAYS SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETYES TO TOLL ABOUT IT IT'S BEE ABOUT THAT IT'S IT'S BEEN REALLY ABOUT THAT HERE SINCE THE MID MINETIES THIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN RULED BY CONTINUING RESOLUTION OR OMNIBOUS BILL THAT'S WHY WE'RE THIRTY THREE SHILLING IN DEBT MY PLAN TO GO ON TO SINGLE SUBJECTS SPENDING BILLS BUT ACTUALLY ALLOW US TO PUT THAT DOWNWARD PRESSURE AND BI'M ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN DIVIDED GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH SENAE DEMOCRATS YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE WHITE HOUSE BUT I DON'T THING YOU SHOULD WORK WITH THEM OUGHT A CONTINUING RESOLUTION OR AN OMNIBOUS BILL YOU SHOULD MAKE THOSE SENATE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO TAKE UP OUR DEFENCE BILL TO GIVE TROOPS ARAYS TAKE UP OUR HOMELAND SECURITY BILL TO MAKE CHANGES AT THE BORDER TAKE UP OUR VETERANS BILL AND IF THEY DID THOSE THINGS PEOPLEOLDHAVE TO VOTE ON SPECIFIC PROGRAMS RATHER THAN JUST SING A WELL YOU KNOW I VOTED FOR THE GOVERNMENT FINDING BILL AND SURE THERE' SOME STUFF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I DON'T LIKE BUT I HAD TO BE THERE FOR THE VESSEL WHEN ISN'T I'D LOVE ALL THAT STUFF TOO IT'S ALSO NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND THE REASON IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN HE'S BECAUSE EVERY TIME ONE OF THOSE BILLS GETS BROUGHT UP DEMOCRATS REJACTEN AND MC CARTHY DOESN'T HAVE A DURABLE ENOUGH MAJWARTY IN THE HOUSE TO ACTUALLY GET THE STUFF DONE IN THE FIRSTLYS NOW TO BE FAIR TO MACGATES WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING MATGATES HAS VOTED AGAINS PRETY MUCH EVERY BUTCHER BILL THAT'S EVER BEEN PRESENTED TO HIM AS CONGRESS PERSON MADGATES IS VOTING RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING ITS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN HIS VERBAL RECORD WHEN IT COMES SO SPENDING HE SEEMS BE COME VERY VOCAL THE MENUTES DOWN FROM IS NOT AN OFFICE WHN IT CAME TO SPENDING WHELL DOWN FROM WAS AN OFFICE HE VOTED FRANKLY HOW I WOULD VOTE ON LY THESE MUT YOUR BILLS NOW BUT HE DIDN'T TALK ALOT ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT WOULD PUT HIM AT DIRECT TO ODD WITH PRESIDEENT TRUMK SO GEN HE'S DON WRONG ON THE SPENDING BUT THIS IS PART OF THE GREAT LI OF OF HOWCONSIDER POLTIC'S WORKS THESE DAYS HE GAD A GET WHAT YOU CAN GET THE NOTION HE CAN ALWAYS GET THE MOON IS SILLY I KNOW THAT THERE IS A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU JUST SHOUT LOUD ENOUGH THE MAGICALLY THINGS MANIFEST THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS WHEN TED CRUISE DESIDED TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER OBOMAC HER IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT BROCCHAMON WOULD REPEAL BOMICER WHOS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN HO'S NEVER GOINGTO HAD WHEN MACGATES HE'S DOING THIS ROUTINE IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT HE'S GIN TO GET REPUBLICANS TO CUT TABOUCH ABOUT FIFTY PER SENT DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE AND JOBIN 'LL GO ALONG WITH IT THAT OBVIOUSLY'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN KEPMAC CARTHY FOR HIS PART HE SAYS HE DON'T BRING IT ON YOU ONT YOU ON A DO THIS THING AGAIN LET'S DO IT MATGATES HE SAYS HE'S GOING TOO ITAKE A MOTION TO DAY KATE HE'S CEN TRY TO OUT TO YOU A SPEAKER UT THE HOUSE THAT'S NOTHING NEW HE'S TRIED TO DO THAT FROM THE MOMENT I RAN FOR OFFICE BUT ALL THIS TIME HE SAYS HE'S GOIN TO KEEP GOING HE MAY NOT THAT THAT BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH BALLAT BUT IT TOOK FIFTEEN FOR CAPAN MC CARTH  U SAYS HE'S COMING FOR YOU CAN YOU SURPAVE YES 'LL SURVIVE OU KNOW THIS IS PERSONAL WITH MAT MAD VOTED AGAINST THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ABILITY TO A PROTECT OUR BORDER SECURE A BORDER HE'S MORE INTERESTED AND SECURING TEVY INTERVIEWS THAN DOING SOMETHINK HE WANTED TO PUSHES INTO A SHUT DOWN EVEN THREATENING HIS ON DISTRICT WITH ALL THE MILITARY PEOPLE THERE WHO WOULD NOT BE PAID ONLY BECAUSE HE WANTS TO TAKE THIS MOTION SO BEIT BRING IT ON LETS GET OVER WITH IT AND LESS START GOVERNING AGAIN MC CARD I'S NOT WRONG ABOUT THIS ONE OFTHE BIG PROMINS HERE IS HE GAN MACATE'S NOT THE ONLY MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THEI'R BUNCH OF CONGRESS MEMBERS WERE IN PURPLE DISTRICTS DOYOU WANT THEM TO LOSE THEIR SEETS MACKATES PARENTLY DOESN'T CARE BECAUSE HERE IS THE THING MACGATES CAN VOTE AGAINST THESE MUCHBILLS S MUCH HE WANTS HES NOT LOSING HIS EATIES A VERY RED DISTRICT BUT IF YOU ARE FOR EXAMPLE REPRESENTED MAC WALLER FROM NW YORK O SEVENTEEN YOU RUD EASILY LOSE YOUR SEAT WHICH MEANS THE HOUSE MAJORITY IS GONE AND WHEN THE HOUSE MANTORITY IS GONE WHAT EXACTLY'S THE CHECK ON DEMOCRATS OIN WHATEVER THE HELD THAT THEY WANT HERE'S MA LONG OR TALKING ABOUT THIS IF THEY VOTE WITH MADGATES AN GATES ONLY NEEDS TO HAVE A HANDFUL OF OF REPUBLICANS AND ANHY CAN REMOVE I A SPEAKER CAPAIN MC CARTHY SO WHAT WHAT SUR MESSAGE TO DEMOCRATS ABOUT WHETHER NOT TO GO ALONG WITH THAT BUT ULTIMATELY DEMOCRATS A GNTO MAKE A DECISION A FOR THEMSELVES I THINK IT IS DESTRUCTIVE TO THE COUNTRY I TO A PUT FORTH THIS MOTIAN A BA CATE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECTED A HOUSE REPUBLICAN MACHARITY TO SERVE AS A CHECK AN BALANCE ON THE BITING A JANDA AND THE ADMINISTRATIONS RECKLESS SPENDING THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO COMPLETE OUR APPROPRIATIONS WORK HE'S NOT WRONG ABOUT THIS BECAUSE AGAIN ID THE EASY TACTICAL DECISUE FOR PEOPLE WHO IR VERY READY AREAS IS ALWAYS TAKE THE HARD LINE AND THEN THERE IS THE OVERALL JOB OF KEVE MC CARTHY TO MAKE SURE THAT HE RETAINS HIS MAJORITY AND DOES MOST CONSERVATIVE THING HE CAN AND LOSN'T ONTINT MC CARTHY WALKS ON WATER AND THE MC CARTHHY MAKES MISTAKES I THINK THAT HE'S DONE THINGS THAT I WOULDN'T DO SOMETIMES DO I THINK THAND WHAT MACATES TATER MAKES ANY SENSE IT'S BECAUSE O MADGATES THAT THE ORIGINAL BETTER BILL THAT THE REPUBLICANS WERE GOING TO PASS GOTSGUNDLED MEANWHILE THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS HEING UP GETS THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST WE GOT A WONDERFUL LADY WORKS OVER HERE NAME FABBY FABBY DOES MA MAKE UP EVERY MORNING SHE IS A DELIGHT WE LOVE FABBY ALSO WHERE ALL LITTLE SCARED IF FABBY FABBY IS THE KIND OF PERSON WHO IF YOU CROSS HER MIGHT COMMIT IN ACTUAL KILLING AND AND SO HERE IS THE THING THERE MIGHT COME A POINT IT'S NOT TO DAY IT'S NOT TO MORROW WHERE WE FEEL SO THREATENED BY FABBY I MEAN PHYSICALLY THREATENED BY FABBY THET WE HAVE TO LOOK TO ZIPROCRUTER IN ORDER TO REPLACE THAT THE'LL BE A VERY SAD DAY BUT ZIPPRI ARE ALSO MAKES SURE THE FABBY STAYS IN LINE AND DOESN'T ACTUALLY

ORIGINALLY FOUND FABBYS HE SHOULD GO CHECK HIM OUT RIGHT NOW ALSO BACK IN MARCH MY GOOD FRIEND LAUNCH THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL JERMYES CHOCOLATE BARS HOLARIOUSLY LABELED HE HIM AND SHE HER ONLY ONE OF WHICH HAS NOTS WHICH YOU YOUD KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE CAMPAIGN WAS A HUGE ET TIT TOLD OUT I MATTER OF DAYS HE'LL KEPT TRYING TO ORD THEM WE GROW OUR INVENTORY WE ALSO SOLD THOSE OUT WHILE NOW JUST IN TIME FOR HOLOWEEN WE ARE PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THE ALLI MIKRO GRESSION SIZE CHOCOLATE BARS BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS EVEN SWEETER ONE SHARE FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE WOLE CORPORATIONS WHO THINK WHERE WOLVES CAN BE MUMMIES THU T JEREMY'S CHOCOLATE DOT TOM ORR YOUR CHOCOLATE TO DAY O CAN MEANWHILE THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR RACE CONTINUES TO BE FASCINATING IN A WIDE VARIETY OF WAIGS ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE OF THE ISLE GOBIDN CONTINUES TO BE INCREDIBLY WEAK  HISNEN TIRE CAMPAGN PITCH IS NOT CAN BE THE ECONOMIC SIE BECAUS AMERICANS HATE IS HE CONONIC PLANS CAN'T BE EMIGRATION MERI CAN TATE IS EMIGRATION PLANS  CAN'T BE CRIME MERICANS ON'T LIKE THAT CANRALLY BE FOREIN POLICY SINCE AMERICANS NON'T LIKE THAT ALL THAT MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE YOU GESS IT DUMOCERSIS DLIKE M IN ANYTH THIS IS JOBIDON'S ENTIRE CAMPAIGNPITCH HE IS I GOT EVERY TIME I SEE HIM IT DOESN'T MATTER EACH INDIVIDUAL CLIP ON THE SHOW HE LOOKS MARKETLY OLDER BETWEEN THE CLIPSE LIKE THE AGING PROCESS HE IS AGING LIKE THAT DUDE AT THE END OF INDIAN A JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE IKE HE DRANK THE WRONG CUP HE TROS PO HERE IS A HERE IS JOBIDON TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY DYING THAT'S WHY THINK THI I WA THEM C INCREASE TE FOE IM A FUNDAMENTALS HERE THAT THE MOCRACY LITEEAR DEMOCRACY HIS STAKE AND AND IS PIN AUDERIN T INSTITUTIONAL TRUCTURES TO PROTECT IT AND I THINK THA THER A GRIN REAL TROUBLE I'M WELL THAT THAT AGAIN IS ONLY GOING TO VALIE IF DONAL TRUMP NUMBER ONE IS THE NOMINY NUMBER TWO IF HE MAKES THAT THE CENTRIPIES OF HIS CAMPAIGN NOW BOTH OF THOSE THINGS COULD VERY WELL HAPPEN IN FACT I TARS THEY CAN EIGHTY PER CENT CHOT THAT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN THAT TRUMP IS DE NOMINY AND THAT ASTHENOMENY THE CENTERPIECE OF HIS CAMPAGN HIS TRUMP BECAUSE TRUMP CAN'T AVOID TALKING ABOUT TRUMP HOWEVER THERE IS NOW ANOTHER CONFOUND SO OUR F CAE JUNIOR IS NOW TALKING ABOUT RUNNING IS AN INDEPENDENT WHICH OF COURSE HE IS BECAUSE WHY WOULDN'T HE HE'S NOT CAN O GET THE TIME OF DAY IN THE DEMOCRATIC CRIMARIES TEY'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW HIM TO RUN IN IN A BROAD MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATIC CRIMARIES HE IS NOT GOING TO ACTIVELY BE ON THE BALLAT IN MANY OF THESE PLACES AND TA AND SO NOW APPARENTLY HE IS GOING TO DROP HIS BID TO CHALLENGE BIDEN FR THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL OMINATION AND INSTADMOUNTS A THIRD PARTY CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY THIS IS ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM MEDIITE A CAM A KENNY CAMPAIGNINSIDER SAYS BOBY FEELS THE DEANC HE IS CHANGING THE RULES TO EXCLUDE HIS CANDIDAEEAS WHEN INTOPEN AN RUN IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO SO HOW MUCH IN THE VOT WILL HE DRAW THIS IS AN OPEN QUESTION HIS CURRENTLY POLLING ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT IN THE NATIONAL SURVEYES THERE 'S NO ACTUAL GOOD POLE THAT SHOWS TRUMP BIDIN KENDEDY AS A THREE PERSON RACE HOWEVER WHAT THE POLES DO SHOW IS THE REPUBLICANS VIEW CKENNEDY MORE WARMLY THAN DEMOCRATS TO SO THERE'S A POLE FROM QUINIPIAC UNIVERSITY FOR EXAMPLE IT CHOWSE THE REPUBLICANS LIKE KENNEDY FORTY EIGHT TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN PER SENT UN FAVORABLE FORTY EIGHT PER CENT FAVORABLE MEANWHILE FOR DEMOCRATS THE QUINIBIAC POLE SHOWS FOURTEEN PER CENT FAVORABLE FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT UNFAVORABLE SO THE EITHER CAN BE A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO ACTUALLY SHIFT A WAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN TO GET AND VOTE FOR KENNEDY IS A THIRD PARTY OPTION OR MORE DEMOCRATS LIKELY TO DO SO NOW TYOU CAN MAKE THE CASE EITHER WAY I ACTUALLY THINK THAT HE'S PRUBLYC LIKELY IN THE END TO DRAW MORE DEMOCRAT VOTES WHY BEAUSE MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO LIKE KENNEDY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY REALLY LIKE DONAL TRUMP STHERE NOT IT'S NOT THE ANTIE TRUMP REPUBLICAN TO LIKE AR OF CA JUNIOR THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CROSS OVER IN THAT COMALAHERIS SPECIAL THAN DIAGRAM AND THAT VEN DIAGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE A LOTNMETAL THE PEOPLE WHO HATE DONAL TRUMP LOVE ARE F CA JUNIOR VERY VERY SMALL GROUP INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HOWEVER THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT REALLY DON'T LIKE JOBIDEN IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND TH PEOPLE WHO LIKE AR OFA JUNIOR AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT ACTUALLY IS A PRETTY SIZABLE GROUPS O IS CAN DRAW MORE FROM REPUBLICANS MORE FROM DEMOCRATS MY GUES IS IN THE END HE WILL DRAW MORE FROM DEMOCRATS THAN ENOUGH TO PUT DONALL TRUMP OVER THE TOP THEORETICALLY IT COULD BE THIS IS WHYES HE SO MUCH FEAR ON DEMOCRATIC CSIDED THE ISLE OVER A NO LABELS RUN OR CORNELL WEST OR SOMETHING THEY'RE AFRAID THAT CORNALL WEST MIGHT DROG JUST ENOUGH OF THE BLACK VOTE TO HURT JOBIDON WHAT ABOUT LIKE A FIVE CANDIDATE RACE IN WHICH YOU HAVE A NO LABEL'S CANDIDATE LIKE SAY A JOMANSION AND YOU HAVE A A CORNELL WEST CANDIDACY WHICH IS SPECIFICALY TARGETING THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN SOM WOKE WITES AND THEN YOU HAVE AN AR OF CA JUNIOR CANDIDACY WHICH IS BASICALLY THE BURNING SANDERS BOT WHAT WHAT WHAT THEN WELL ALL OF THIS COULD CHIP AWAY AT JOBIDONS LEAD THAT IS PRESUME ALY ONE F THE REASONS WHY REPUBLICANS ARE PETTY POSITEV ABOUT OUR OF CA JUNIOR THEY THINK THAT MAYBE HE'S GON A THWART JOBIDES REALECT EFFORTS SO THAT AS SORT OF A FASCINATING DYNAMIC TO THROW INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CAMPAIGN MEANWHILE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE ISLE THE TWO MAIN STREAM CANDIDATES WHO OR OPPOSING TRUMP BECAUE ALL THEOTHER CANDIDATES ON THE STAGE ARE THERE FOR BLEEPSIN GIGGLES BASICALLY THE VACROMASUAMIAS HAVE SAID BEFORE IS RUNNING FOR A SENATE IN OHIO OR HIS RUNNING FOR A POSITION AN FROMS CABINETE OR HE'S RUNNING FOR PODGAST TIMSCOT IS THERE NO ONE KNOWS WHY DUG BURGHAM NO ONE KNOWS WHY CRIS CRISTE BECAUSE HE HATES LIFE MIHT PENS BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SHORP IS LEGACY BUT THE ONLY OTHER TWO CANDIDATES THERE WHO ARE ARE SERIOUS CANDIDATES ARE NICKEE HALY AND RONDISANTIS BOTH OF THEM HAD INTERESTING WEAK ENDS OVER THE WEAK END SO RONDO SANTIS WHEN ON BOMARS SHO AND HE ACTUALLY DID WHT E SHOULDHAVE DONE LIKE THREE MONTHS AGO IT'S AN INTERVIEW WHERE HE WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO P USH BACK AGAINST LEFT HIS TROPES YOU'LL HAVE A FEW VITAL MOMENTS SO HE'S ASKE BY BILMAR YOU ON THE LAST ELECTIONS I CL YOU BACK TO MUNCHI CANDIDATES WHO DENYD THAT YOU'LL BIDE ONE LAST ELECTION WHY DID YOU DO THAT AND HERE IS A THESANCY'S EXCELLENT ANSWER BUT YOU CAMPAIGNS FOR FOR ELECTION DENYERS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO THIS I DO NOT FORGIVE WELL LOK WOT THE GODFATHER HARRY LAKE WHO SAID BYDNES ILEGINMENT PRESIDENT TRUMPTOD NOW SHE'S ATTACKING ME SO MAYBE I DID MAKE A MISTAKE THERE CAUSE A SHE'S OUT THEIR SAYING SHES SES YOU MIN TO SAY THAT WE MANDATED VACS IND FLORIDA WE DID THE OPPOSITE WE PROTECTED PEOPLE EVEN FROM PRIVATE MANDATE SO SOS TATHAT MAY HAVE BEEN TRUMP LOST THE ELECTION AD THAT Y SO WHY DID YOU CAMPAIGN FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE REPUBLICANS WIN HE RACEES AT I GEST HIM THAT ER NOT AT ON YOUL BREAKER ISSUE FOR YOU THAT' SON DEMOCER O YOL CA BLE LET'S GO BACK TO TWENTY SIXTEEN U YOUR FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD WERE CUTTING HADS TELLING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO TO VOTE AGAINST TRONK IN IN THE

SOME PRETTY EXCELLENT INTERSECTIONAL CRENENTIALS O KATE TIME FOR SOME THINGS THAT I LIKE AND THEN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS THAT I LIKE TO DAY I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS MUSING TO WATCHD DEMOCRATS EFFAROUND AND FIND OUT WHEN IT COMES TO EMIGRATION SO CATHY HOCAL GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK THE STATES BEING ININDATED WITH ELEGAL EMOGRANDS FOR BEING SHIPD FROM THE SOUTHERN BOARDR BECAUSE TURNS OUT LOD PEOPLE ROSS ON BOARD WOITD LIKE TO GO TO NEW YORK SHEIS LIKE WELL YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE A SOLUTION BE T RESTRICT MIGRATION OH YOU DON'T SAY CAFY HERE EGO IT CAN BE DONE THIS CANBE DONE IN A BY PIRISON WAY COMPREHENSIVE EMIGRATION FORMWA THAT SPEVELYS WONGRES HEOPL CAN COMMIT WELL WE WANT THEM TO HAVE A LIMIT ON WHO CAN COME ACROSS THE BORDER IT IS TOO OPEN RIGHT NOW HOW PEOPLE COMING FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE FINDING THEIR WAY THROUGH SIMPLY THAY MAY MEET ASYLUM AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM SEEN BANDING UP AN THE STRENGTS OF NEW YORK AND THAT IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR NEW YORK CITY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NILLY ARRIVED IN INVINTALS AND WE ARE BEING TACT THAT WE ARE ALWAYS SO PROUD OF TH FACT THAT NEW YORK HAS THE THAC OF LIBERTY IN OUR HOMBOR HARBOR WE WE ARE HY OF THE MOST DOVERSE PLACES ON EARTH BECAUSE OF OUR WELCOMING NATURE AND AR IT'S AT OUR DAINADA WELCOME IMOCRADS BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME LIMITS THAN PLAYS AND CONGRESS HAS TO PUT MORE CONTROLS AT THE BORDER

GREAT IRONY TO ALL THE  DEMOCRATS WERE CLAIMING WHAT WOA ITS TAND THESTATCH OF LIBERTY LOOK AT THE STATCH OF LIBERTY WHAT OES IT SAY WELL IT'S IN NEW YORK AND APPARENTLY GI'S CARRIED SO THAT'S EXCITING NEWS THE YORK TIMES HAS AN ENTIRE PEACE TODAY TOTLED WHY WE CAN'T WHY CAN'T WE STOP UNAUTHORIZE MIGRATION BECAUSE IT WORKS APPARENTLY IT'S AMAZING ACCORDING TO THE NEWYORK TIMES RESPONDING T THE SENSE OF CRISIS IN NEW YORK AND ROUND THE NATION THE EPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY RECENTLY ANNOUNCED TO D GRANT TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRD SEVENY TO THOUSAND MEN IS WAYLANDS ALLOWING THEM EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO LIV IN WORK IN THE UNITED STATES THIS MEASURE MAY HELP NEW YORK BECAUSE MANY OF THE MIGRANTS THERE HAVE TRAVELLED TO THE STATE FROM MEN IS WALUP BUT AS THE ORC ADAMS POINT IT OUT ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE NEW YORK NOW ALSO SHELTERS MAGRANT FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE INCLUDING ECLADOR EASTERN EUROPE IN WEST AFRICA SO THE BYD ADMINISTRATIONS DECISION ON TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS IS IT BEST A PARTIAL AND FLEETING SOLUTION THE VARIATIONS AND POLISY BETWEN ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE HAD ALMOST NO EFFECT ON THE NUMBER OF MAGRANTS TRYING TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN BORDER SO WHY EXACTLY IS THITS HAPPENING WHELE BECAUSE SAYS THE NEUR TIMES TO EVERYBODY IS VERY MOBIL ALSO OUR LABOR MARKETS RE QUIR LOW COST LABOR AN AMERICAN CONSUMERS BENEFIT FROM THE LOW COST LABOR WHICH BY HE WAY IF THE NEAR TIMES THOGH ABOUT THIS FOR TWO SECONDS THEY MIGHT THINK HAY MAY BE THE UNIONS THAT WERE CONSTANTLY BACKING ARE ACTUALLY A PROBLEM FOR THE COST OF LABOR IN THE UNITED STATES LEGAL EMIGRATION TO DAY IS CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR MOST PEOPLE SO LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET THROUGH THROUGH THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND THAT'S WHY AY WELL NUMBER ONE THAT DOESN'T ANSWER WHY EXACTLY WE SHOULDN'T SHUT THE BORDER ON A MORAL LEVEL BUT ALSO IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION IF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THE REASONING LEGAL EMIGRATION IS MANITORIES BECAUSE WE NED LOWER LABOR COSTS MAYBE SHOULD STOP ACKING IN FLATIONARY PUBLIC POLICY THE JACKS UP LABOR COST FROM UNION POLICY TO MONITARIAN PYSICAL POLICY TO WELFARE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR LOW PAY IN THE PRIVATE SECR BUT THE NERSE THEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE TAX PAYER MAYBE BE  MAYBE THOSE THINGS NO NOTHING BUELER E I GUESS THE NURUST CAN HAVE TO DEAL WAT THE FALL UP AURDIGAS THE REST OF TE SHOW CONTINUES AT RIGHT

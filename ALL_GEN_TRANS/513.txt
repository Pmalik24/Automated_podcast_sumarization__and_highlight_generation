WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAHOCENS S GOF SCIENCE  SCIENCE PACE TO    I MAN DRHUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEURBOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TO DAY WE CONTINUE IN OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT SENSATION OR HOW WE SENSE THINGS ON PREVIOUS EPISODES WE TALK ABOUT SENSING LIGHT AND SOUND WAVES FOR THINGS LIKE VISION AND HEARING TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OUR SENSE OF SELF OR WHAT'S CALLED INTERROCEPTION INTERROCEPTION IS OUR SENSING OF OUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE THINGS LIKE OUR HEART BE OUR BREATHING AND OUR GUT HOW FULL OUR GUT MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE OR HOW EMPTY OUR GUT MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE BUT ALSO OUR INNER LANDSCAPE WITH RESPECT TO CHEMISTRY HOW ACITIC OR HOW GOOD OR BAD WE FEEL ON THE INSIDE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT SENSE OF SELF AND INTERRECEPTION HAS MANY IMPORTANT ACTIONABLE ITEMS THAT RELATE TO BODILY HEALTH AND BRAIN HEALTH AND BELIEVE IT ARE NOT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM WELL OR PERFORE OR PERFORM POORLY IN LIFE INDEED IT HAS PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON OUR RATES OF HEALING SO TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE ASPECTS OF OUR INNER LANDSCAPE AND HOW R BRAIN EMBODY COMMUNICATE AND THERE WILL BE MANY ACTIONABLE PROTOCOLS AS WE GO ALONG THAT DISCUSSION BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT SENSE OF SELF I WANT A HIGHLIGHT SOME VERY RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH FINDINGS THAT I BELIEVE ARE IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE AND THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THESE ARE DATA THAT WERE PUBLISHED BY MY COLLEGUE JUST IN SONINBERG'S LABORATORY AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND THE DATA WERE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SELL WHICH IS A VERY VERY HIGH STRINGENCY SELL PRESS JOURNAL SO PHENOMENAL DATA WHAT THE STUDY SHOWED WAS THAT INDIVIDUALS GIVEEN A HIGH FIBRE DIET ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE LESS DIVERSITY OF WHAT'S CALLED THE GUT MICROBIOM THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE OR HEALTH PROMOTING BACTERIA IN THE GUT WAS ACTUALLY REDUCED BY A HIGH FIBRE DIET WHEREAS INDIVIDUALS THAT AIT JUST A COUPLE OF SERVINGS O FERMENTED FOOD EACH DAY EXPERIENCE IMPORTANT AND BENEFICIAL INCREASES IN ANTI INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND THAT COULD BE TRACED BACK TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GUT MICROBIOM DIVERSITY THE DIVERSITY OF BUGS LITERALLY LITTLE BACTRIA THAT LIVE IN THE GUT WHICH MIGHT SOUND BAD BUT THEY AR ACTUALLY VERY HEALTH PROMOTING I'M GOING TO GET INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF THIS STUDY LATER IN THE EPISODE BUT I JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THESE FINDINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE IN JESTING ONE OR TWO SERVINGS OF FERMENTED FOOD EACH DAY IS REASONABLE AND DOES NOT BRING WITH IT TREMENDOUS COST OR TREMENDOUS INCONVENIENCE AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE ARE INJESTING HGH FIBRE DIETS THINKING THAT THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE THEIR GUT MICROBIOM SO WHILE THESE DATA MAY PROVE TO BE CONTROVERSIAL AMONG THE A FOLKS OUT THERE IN THE NUTRISION COMMUNITY THAT REALLY PROMOTE HIGH FHIBRE D I IT WENE ED YOUS EMPHASIZED THAT THESE DATA WERE LOOKED AT IN A VERY UNBIASED WAY THEY WERE DONE WITH LARGE SCALE SCREENS OF ALL SORTS OF INFLAMATORY MARKERS THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC HYPOTHESIS GOING IN IT WAS PURELY EXPLORATORY BUT THE DATE ARE VERY VERY CLEAR IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULDN'T HEED FIBR DOESN'T MEAN THAT FIBERS BAD BUT IT REALLY SHOWS THAT EATING FORMENTED FOODS JUST ONE OR TWO SERVINGS TO DAY AND MAY BE EVEN RAMPING UP TO THREE OR FOUR SERVINGS PERDAY CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR MANY ASPECTS OF HEALTH BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLTIC GREENS AON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGRENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WO'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT INVITEM IN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THREE K TO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLITES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PETASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR I'VE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES IND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MANESIUM AN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPERATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATIO N AND THAT YOURE GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT E DOCAM SLASH HUBERMENT AND YOU GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT E DOCM SLASH HUBERMAN IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO'S INTERESTED IN PERFORMANCE OF ANY KIND IN WORK IN RELATIONSHIPS ET CETERA TODAY'S TOPIC I BELIEVE IS AMONG THE MORE IMPORTANT ONES FOR YOU OF ALL THE TOPICS I COULD COVER THIS THING THAT WE CALL SENSE OF SELF IS ALSO CALLED INTERROCEPTION HAS PERHAPS THE MOST FOUNDATIONAL LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE FOR ALL THAT WE FEEL ALL THAT WE DO AND ALL THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING IN FACT I WILL GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT INTERROCEPTION OR OUR ABILITY TO SENSE OUR INNER REAL ESTATE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO SLEEP AND PERHAPS ONE OTHER FEATURE OF OUR HEALTH AND BODILY FUNCTION THAT PRIMARILY DETERMINE HOW GOOD WE FEEL IN THE NOW IN THE SHORTERM AND IN THE LONG TERM AND SETS THE STAGE FOR EVERYTHING WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING ND IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THIS THING THAT WE CALL INTERROCEPTION JUST LIKE IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF SLEEP WE CANNOT PERFORM WELL AND WE WILL NOT REMAIN HEALTHY IN TERRECEPTION AND SENSE OF SELF ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING I WILL USE THOSE TERMS INTERCHANGEABLY AT LEAST FORSAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION I PROMISE THAT IF YOU CAN LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MECHANISMS OF SELF SENSING OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR INTERNAL MILU AS WE SAY YOUR INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT YOU WILL POSITION YOURSELF TO DO SOME VERY SIMPLE THINGS THAT CAN LEAD TO OUTSISE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON EVERYTHING FROM SLEEP TO BODY COMPOSITION TO MENTAL FOCUS TO MOOD YOUR ABILITY TO REGULATE STRESS AND INDEED EVEN YOUR ABILITY TO HEAL AND RECOVERY FROM INJURIES OF DIFFERENT KINDS BRAIN INJURY AND BODILY INJURY SO SENSE OF SELF IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IT SOMETIMES CALLED OUR SIXTH SENSE RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE OTHER FIVE CENSES LIKE HEARING VISION TOUCH TA SMELL ET CETERA BUT SENSE OF SELF IS DIFFERENT SENSE OF SELF IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR SKIN AND IT INVOLVES TWO KEY FEATURES THAT IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THOSE FEATURES AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT MODULATES OR CHANGES OUR ABILITY TO SENSE THOSE FEATURES THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN TERMS OF HOW YOU STRUCTURE YOUR NUTRITIONAL PRACTICES HOW YOU RELATE TO YOUR EXERCISE PRACTICES PERHAPS EVEN CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU TAKE IN TERMS OF SUPPLEMENTATION THAT CAN BASICALLY MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER MORE ALERT AND MORE CAPABLE FOR EVERYTHING I DON'T THNK THAT'S A HYPEROBOLIC STATEMENT I IN FACT I KNOW IT'S NOT A HYPEROBOLIC STATEMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN OUR BODY THAT CONNECTS OUR BRAIN TO ALL OF OUR BODILY ORGANS AND CONNECTS ALL OF THOSE BODILY ORGANS T O OUR BRAIN AND THAT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BRAIN AND BODY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS CREATES A SITUATION WHERE EITHER WE ARE POSITION TO DO THINGS WELL OR WE ARE POSITION TO DO THINGS POORLY SO I REALLY WANT A DIVE IN IN DISSECT WHAT IS THIS SYSTEM OF BRAIN BODY COMMUNICATION WHAT IES IT LOOK LIKE WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL NURONS IN CONNECTIONS AND AS I DO THAT I PROMISE THAT I'M GOING TO PLACE PROTOCALS TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NURONS AND CONNECTIONS ARE WORKING OPTIMALLY SO LET'S BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT WHAT SYSTEM COMMUNICATES THE BRAIN TO THE BODY AND THE BODY BACK TO THE BRAIN THE SYSTEM THAT'S MOST OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IS OUR TENTH CRANIAL NERVE CALLED THE VAGUEST NERVE THE WORD VAGUEST RELATES TO THE WORD VAGABOND WHICH IS TO WANDER AND INDEED THE VAGUEST NERVE IS A VAST ENORMOUS WANDERING SEID OF NERVE SO IT'S NOT ONE NERVE IT'S NOT LIKE ONE FIBER ONE AXON AS WE SAY IN THE NERVOU SYSTEM WE HAVE THESE WIRES WE CALL AX ONS THAT LET NURONS COMMUNICATE IT'S A BUNCH OF NURONS AND A BUNCH OF WIRES THAT GO EVERYWHERE SO WHERE DO THEY GO WELL THEY LEAVE THE BRAIN AND THE BRAIN STEM THE BRAINSTEM IS KIND THE BACK YOUR BRAIN IF YOU TOUCHD THE BACK YOUR NECK IT'S ABOUT THREE INCHES DEEP TO WHERE YOUR TOUCHING THE NURONS THAT ARE THERE SEND INFORMATION INTO THE BODY TO CONTROL YOUR BODILY ORGANS HOW FAST YOUR HEART IS BEATING HOW FAST YOUR BREATHING HOW FAST YOUR DIGESTION IS OCCURRING EVEN THINGS LIKE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE GOING TO SECRET SO CALLED KILLER CELLS YOUR IMUNE SELLS FROM YOUR SPLEEN TO GO WORD OFF BACTERIA NOW THE NURONS THERE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO UNLESS THEY RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THE BODY AND WITHIN THE BODY YOUR HEART YOUR LONGS YOUR DIAPHRAM YOUR GUT SO EVERYTHING FROM YOUR INTESTINS TO YOUR STOMAC ET CETERA AND YOUR SPLEEN ARE SENDING INFORMATION ALSO UP TO THE BRAIN SO THAT AS I MENTION BEFORE IT'S A TWO WAST STREET SO THE VAGUEST NERVE IS A VERY IMPORTANT NERVE BUT JUST BY SAYING VAGUEST NERVE IT SOUNDS LIKE A SINGULAR IT'S SOUNDS LIKE ONE THING BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A SERIES OF SUPER HIGHWAYS IT'S LIKE GUGL MAPS TAT'S GOT STUFF GOING EVERYWHERE WITH ALTERNATE ROOTS COMMUNICATING BACK AND FORTH THERE ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY THAT NEED TO BE COMMUNICATED TO YOUR BRAIN THESE NURONS IN YOUR BRAINSTEM IN ORDER FOR YOUR BRAIN IN YOUR BODY TO WORK TOGETHER CORRECTLY AND THE TWO TYPESOF INFORMATION ARE MECHANICAL INFORMATION SO THINGS LIKE PRESSURE THINGS LIKE LACK OF PRESSURE AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION WHETHER R NOT YOUR GUT IS ACITIC OR WHETHER NOT ITS NOT ACIDIC WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF PATHAGEN U KNOW SOMETHING THAT YOU AT OR THAT GOT INTO YOUR BODY SOMEHOW AND IS MAKING YOU SICK OR WHETHER OR NOT YOU DON'T HAVE A PATHAGIN IN YOUR BODY SO YOU'VE GOT MECHANICAL SENSING AND CHEMICAL SENSING SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR SENSE OF SELF AND YOUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY IF YOU F OUL GOOD OR IF YOU FEEL BAD YOUR SENSE OF SELF IS DEPENDENT ON THESE MECHANICAL PHENOMENON AND THESE CHEMICAL PHENOMENON AND FOR EVERY ORGAN IN YOUR BODY WHETHER NOT THAT'S YOUR HEART OR YOUR LUNGS OR YOUR SPLEEN BOTH THE MECHANMICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ORGAN FOR INSTANCE IS IF YOUR GOT IS FULL OR EMPTY WHETHER NOT YOUR HEART IS BEATING FAST OR BEATING SLOWLY THAT'S MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION WHETHER NOT YOUR GUT FEELS NICE AND WHETHER YOU KNOW WHEN I SAY NICE EN MOU WHETHER NOT IT HAS A BALANCE OF ACIDITY AND ALKALINITY THAT FEELS RIGHT TO YOU OR WHETHER NOT YOUR GUT FEELS OFF IT DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT THAT'S CHEMICAL INFORMATION IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN AND LEVELS OF CARBONDIOXIDE ANOTHER GAS GO UP TOO HIGH SO YOUR LUNGS CAN REGISTER THAT AND THAT CHEMICAL INFORMATION IS SENT TO YOUR BRAIN AND THEN YOUR BRAIN DOES CERTAIN THINGS ACTUALLY T REALLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO DO CERTAIN THINGS IN ORDER TO ADJUST THAT CHEMISTRY SO THE FIRST PRINCIPAL THAT EVERYONE SHOULD UNDERSTAND ABOUT THEIR SENSE OF SELF IS THAT THEY ARE SENSING MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION ABOUT EVERY ORGAN IN THEIR BODY ECCEPT FOR ONE AND THAT'S THE BRAIN YOUR BRAIN ACTUALLY DOESN'T HAVE PAIN RECEPTORS IT DOES'T EVEN HAVE TOUCH RECEPTORS THE BRAIN IS A COMMAND CENTR IT HELPS DRIVE AND GOVERN CHANGES IN THE ORGANS OF THE BODY BUT YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T MOVE AT LEAST NOT MUCH YOU CAN MOVE A LITTLE BIT FLUID MOVES WITHIN IT BUT IS ONG YOUR HEALTHY IT'S NOT MOVING THAT MUCH YOUR BRAIN HAS NO SENSATION OF ITS OWN IN FACT WHEN THEY DO BRAIN SURGERY ON PEOPLE THEY WILL A NEST THESIZE OR PUT SOME INASESIA ON THE SCALP THEY'LL CUT AWAY THE SKIN THERE SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL ANYTHING THAT'L USELT SOMANASESIA THEY'LL PEEL BACK THE SKIN AND THEN THEY'LL USE A WON'T LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS IT'S A BONE SAW AND THEY THASICALLY SAW OPEEN A LITTLE WINDOW IN THE SKULL AVE ACTUALLY DONE THIS BEFORE AND SEEN THIS BEFORE HOVE DONES MANY TIMES BEFORE AND ONCE YOUR INSIDE THE BRAIN YOU CAN PUT ELECTRODES IN THERE AND YOU CAN PUT VARIOUS THINGS IN THERE OF COURSE ALL FOR THEIRAPUTIC PURPOSES AND YOU DO THAT WITHOUT ANY ANASESIA TO THE ACTUAL BRAIN TISSUE BECAUSE IT HAS NO RECEPTORS TO SENSE ANYTHING IT DOESN'T HAVE PAIN RECEPTORS IT DOESN'T HAVE PRESSURE RECEPTORS NONE OF THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A HEADACHE IN YOUR HEAD FEELS LIKE ITS TOO MUCH PRESSURE WELL THAT'S BECAUSE OF RECEPTORS THAT LIE OUTSIDE THE BRAIN SO YOUR ORGANS ARE DIFFERENT THEY NEED TO TELL YOUR BRAIN WHAT'S GOING ON AND THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN CONTROL THE MECHANICAL AND THE CHEMICAL STATE OF YOUR ORGANS IN WAYS THAT ARE VERY POWERFUL AND THIS IS CRUCIAL TO DO BECAUSE IF YOU CAN PROPERLY REGULATE THE MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT OF YOUR BODY YOUR BRAIN FUNCTIONS BETTER THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR FROM DATA THAT IF YOUR GUT IS HEALTHY IF YOU GET THE ALKALINITY RIGHT THE ACIDITY RIGHT AND IF YOU ARE SPLEEN IS HEALTHY AND HAPPY AND IF YOUR LUNGS ARE WORKING PROPERLY NOT JUST BREATHING AND PUMPING IN AND OUT EIR BUT YOUR BREATHING AT THE RITE CADENCE FOR A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY THAN YOUR BRAIN WILL FUNCTION BETTER SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN ADJUST THE MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT OF YOUR ORGANS IN ORDER TO MAKE YOUR BRAIN BETTER AND HOW YOUR BRAIN CAN MAKE THE MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT WITHIN YOUR ORGANS FUNCTION BETTER FOR INSTANCE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CHANGE THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR GUT IN ORDER FOR YOUR BRAIN TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS BETTER THINK BETTER REMEMBER BETTER AND SLEEP BETTER AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CHANGE THE CHEMISTRY OF OTHER ORGANS IN YOUR BODY SUCH THAT YOUR MUNE SYSTEM WILL FUNCTION BETTER THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEEL FASTER FROM SMALL CUTS AND BRUISES BUT ALSO INJURIES OF ANY KIND EVEN MAJOR INJURIES SO AS I MENTION BEFORE WE'VE GOT THESE ORGANS THE HEART THE LUNGS THE DIAPHRAME AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS THE GUT AND THE SPLEEN AND THE SPLEEN IS THIS AMUN ORGAN LET'S TAKE ONE EXAMPLE OF THESE AND EXPLAIN HOW MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION FROM THIS PARTICULAR SET OF ORGANS COMMUNICATES TO THE BRAIN AND HOW THAT CHANGES HOW OUR BRAIN WORKS AND THE ORGAN I LIKE TO FOCUS ON FIRST ARE THE LUNGS AND THE DIAPHRAME WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH OUR LUNGS THESE TWO BIG BAGS OF AIR BUT HE ACTUALLY NOT TOO BIG BAGS OF ARE THEY ACTUALY HAVE LITTLE TINY SACKS WITHIN THEM MACHLY MILLIONS OF LITTLE SACKS CALLD THE IVIOLI OF THE LUNGS THE IFWEO THE LUNGS ARE LIKE LITTLE TINY BALLOONS THROUGHOUT OUR LUNGS AND THE MORE OF THOSE BALLOONS WE HAVE THE MORE AIR THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CONTAIN SO WE ARE NOT TOO BIG A BAGS OF AIR AND THERE ARE LUNGS WE ACTULY HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF LITTLE TINY BAGS OF AIR WITHIN THOSE LUNGS THOSE LITTLE BAGS OF AIR CAN FILL UP OR THEY CAN DEFLATE RIGHT JUST LIKE YOUR LUNGS OVER ALL CAN FILL UP OR THEY CAN DEFLAGHT THE DIAPHRAME IS A MUSCLE IT'S CONSHAPED LIKE A DOME SO IT'S CONE OF IT YOU KNOW THAT THINK ABOUT A BASKETBALL FOR A OR SOKERBALL THAT HAS MOST OF THE AIR PUSHED OUT OF IT AND SO IT'S KIND OF CRESCENT SHAPE OR OR DOME SHAPED AND IT SITS BELOW OUR LUNGS AND THE WAY THE DIAPHRAM IN THE LUNGS WORK TOGETHER IS VERY INTERESTING THE DIAPHRAME IS ACTUALLY SKELETAL MUSCLES SO IT'S JUST LIKE A BISEP OR QUADRASEP ANDTHE FACT THAT IT IS SKELETA MUSCLE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAS A UNIQUE PROPERTY WHICH IS THAT YOU CAN CONTROL IT VOLUNTARILY YOU CAN DECIDE TO TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR DIAPHRAM BY JUST CONSCIOUSLY DECIDING YOU WANT TO BREATHE IN A PARTICULAR WAY JUST LIKE YOU CAN TAKE CONSCIENS CONTROL OVER YOUR LEGS THEY WILL WORK JUST FINE IF YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THEM AS YOU WALK AS PROVIDE YOUORAY KNOW HOW TO WALK BUT AT ANY MOMENT YOU CAN DECIDE TO CHANGE THE RATE OF YOUR WALKING YOUR SO CALLED CADENCE OF WALKING SO THE DIAPHRAME AS THE SKELETO MUSCLE ALSL HAS THAT PROPERTY THE DIAPHRAME MOVES UP AND DOWN DEPENDING ON HOW YOU BREATHE OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY HOW THE DIAPHRAME MOVES UP AND DOWN DETERMINS HOW YOU BREATHE HOW YOU BREATHE IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON LITTLE MUSCLES THAT ARE BETWEEN YOUR RIBS ON THE INTERCOSTALES AND OTHER MUSCLES IF YOURE MARSHAL ART'S FAN TE BRUSLEE WAS FAMOUS FOR HAVING THESE FERY PRONOUNCE INTERCOSTLES O FROM DOING ALL SORTS OF N ON BRIDGING EXERCISE ET CETERA BUT IF THOSE ARE THAT THE MUSCLES AND WE ALL HAVE THEM EVEN IF SOME A SOME OF US MOST OF US A DON'T HAVE O INTERCOSTLES LIKE BRUCE LEAP SO WHEN YOU BREATHE A COUPLE THINGS HAPPEN BUT LET'S TALK BY THE MECHANICAL THINGS FIRST AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT O THOSE MECHANICAL STEPS RELATE BACK TO THE BRAIN IN WHAT THAT DOES FOR THE BRAIN AND I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU DEVELOP IN AWARENESS OF THESE MECHANICAL CHANGES YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH EXTENSIVE BREATH WORK PRACTICE OR DO EXTENSIVE BREATH WORK YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY BELIEVE IT OR NOT DEVELOP A SENSE OF YOUR BREATHING SELF OF YOUR LUNGS IN DIAPHRAM IT TAKES NO PRACTICE BUT ONCE YOU DO IT YOU WILL FOREVER BE CHANGED IN TERMS OF YOUR AWARENESS OF YOUR BREATHING AND YOUR ABILITY TO LEVIRGE YOUR BREATHING CONTELECT THE STEERING WHEEL ON A CAR IN ORDER TO SHIFT YOUR BRAIN IN THE DIRECTION THA YOU WANT TO GOES WITH A VERY POWERFUL SYSTEM AND THE WAY IT WORKS IS THE FOLLOWING AND THIS WILL ALSO INCORPORATE THE HEART SO AND BY THE HEART I DON'T MEAN IN THE EMOTIONAL SENSE ALTHOUGH WE WE DON'T RULE OUT EMOTIONS HERE AT THE HUBERMAN LAMPONCASS WE LIKE EMOTIONS BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE HEART AS AN ORGAN AS A BEATING ORGAN THAT CIRCULATES A BLOOD SO WHEN WE INHALE THE SULLE SACON OUR LUNGS FILL UP AND OUR LUNGS EXPAND AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE TAKE UP SPACE IN OUR THRACIC CAVITY AND OUR DIAPHRAM MOVES DOWN C WHEN WE EXHALE THE DIAPHRAME MOVES UP THE LUNGS GET SMALLER C SO INHALES DIAPHRAME MOVES DOWN EXHALES DIAPHRAM MOVES UP THIS ACTUALLY CONTROLS OUR HEART RATE BUT IT DOES IT BY CHANGING THE WAY THAT OUR BRAIN WORKS AND IT WORKS IN THE FOLLOWING WAY SO WHEN WE INHALE OUR LUNGS FILL OUR DIAPHRAME MOVES DOWN OUR HEART ACTI HAS A LITTLE MORE SPACE BECAUSE THE DIAPHRAMS MOVE DOWN SO THAT HEART GETS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER PHYSICALLY BIGGER NOT IN THE EMOTIONAL SENSE BUT PHYSICALLY BIGGER AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER BLOOD IS IN THE HEART FLOWS AT A SLOWER RATE BECAUSE ITS A LARGER VOLUME SO BIGGER VOLUME HEART SAME AMOUNT OF A BLOOD INSIDE THE HEART MEANS SLOWER FLOW CAS OR LIKE EXPANDING A PIPE THE BRAIN REGISTERS THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SET OF NURONS ON THE HEART CALLED THE SINAL ATRIAL NOE IT SENDS THAT INFORMATION TO THE BRAIN THAT INFORMATION IS REGISTERED BY THE BRAIN AND THE BRAIN SENDS A MESSAGE BACK TO THE HEART TO SPEED THE HEART UP SO EVERY TIME YOU INHALE BECAUSE OF THESE MECHANICAL CHANGES IN THE DIAPHRM AND LUNGS AND BECAUSE OF THE MEHANICAL CHANGES IN THE HEART YOUR BRAIN SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE HEART TO SPEED THE HEART UP SO IF YOU DO LONG INHALES OR YOU INHALE MORE VIGOROUSLY YOU ACTUALLY ARE SPEEDING YOUR HEART UP NOW OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO EXHALE AS WELL BUT FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO INHALE VERY LONG LIKE THE ENTIRE TIME MY HEART RATE IS INCREASING AND THEN IF I DID A QUICK EXHALE SOMETHING ELSE WILL HAPPEN BUT IF I KEPT DOING THAT MY HEART RATE WOULD INCREASE SNOCKIN INCREASE LINERILY AND FOREVER BUT IT WILL INCREASE WITH EACH INHAL MORE I CAN SIMPLY MAKE MY INHALS MORE VIGOROUS AND MY HEART RATE WILL SPEED UP THIS IS AN AUTONOMIC AND AUTOMATIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIAPHRAM THE LUNGS THE BRAIN AND THE HEART NOW IF INHALE SPEED THE HEART UP WHAT HAPPENS ON EXHAILS WHEN WE EXHAL THE DIAPHRAME MOVES UP SO LO COUNTER INTO IT A BE KIND O THINK  YOU CAN KIND OF THINK ABOUT IS LIKE PUSHING THE PLUNGE ON A SRINGE RIGHT WHEN YOU EXHAL THIS THING MOVES UP AND AS THE DIAPHRAME MOVES UP THE HEART HAS LESS SPACE MEANING IT GETS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER WHICH MEANS THAT WHATEVER VOLUME OF BLOOD IS INSIDE THE HEART MOVES FASTER THROUGH THAT SMALLER VOLUME THAT INFORMATION IS SENT TO THE BRAIN VIA THES COLLECTION OF NARANS CALLED THE SINO ATRIAL NODE FOR YOU IF ESIONATOMS THE BRAIN THEN SENDS INFORMATION VIA THE VAGEST NERVE BACK TO THE HEART TO SLOW THE HEART DOWN SO WHILE INHALES SPEED UP THE HEART THAT'S THE NET EFFECT EXHALES SLOW THE HEART DOWN AND THE REASON THEY SLOW THE HEART DOWN IS BECAUSE OF A REGISTER IN THE CHANGE IN MECHANICAL PRESSURE BETWEEN THE DIAPHRAM THE LUNGS AND THE HEART SO THIS IS TO ME THE SIMPLEST AND MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD EXAMPLE OF HOW THE BRAIN IS CHANGING THE WAY OUR ORGAN'S WORK ARE HEART IN THIS CASE ACCORDING TO CHANGES IN MECHANICAL IN TERRECEPTION NOW WE'RE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF THIS SOME OF US ARE AWARE OF IT SOME OF ITS ART IF YOU DO IT RIGHT NOW YOU WILL BE AWARE OF IT SUCH YOU CAN TRY THIS YOU CAN BASICALLY THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT OR AN EXAMPLE IN IN TERRECEPTION INSENSING ONE'S SELF SO IF YOU INHAL DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG YOU INHAL I'LL DO IT FOR COUPLE SECONDS AND THE NEXHAL TWICE IS LONG NOSE OR MOUTH DOESN'T MATTER THE ENTIRE TIME THAT YOUR EXHALING YOUR SLOWING YOUR HEART DOWN SO JUST AS THE CAR HAS AN ACCELERATOR IN A BREAK OR YOU CAN SLOW A CAR BY COMING OFF THE ACCELERATOR WHEN YOU EXHALE YOUR EFFECTIVELY COMING OFF THE ACCELERATOR OR IF YOU WONT A THING ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY YOUR HITTING THE BREAK YOUR SLOWING DOWN YOUR HEART RATE NOW NORMALLY YOUR HEART RATE STAYS IN MORE OR LESS THE SAME RANGE FOR A GIVEN ACTIVITY BGAS YOUR INHALING AND EXHALN BUT THIS IS JUST THE SIMPLE WAY OF SHOWING THAT MECHANICAL CHANGES IN YOUR VISERA CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOUR BRAIN WORKS AND THEN YOUR BRAIN CHANGES THE WAY THAT THOSE VICIRA WORK AND IT'S A VERY CONCRETE AGREEMENTS LIKE A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY AND THE BRAIN IN FACT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THIS CONTRACT IN MORE DETAIL AND YOU CAN LEVERAGE THIS IN A VERY POWERFUL WAY TO SET THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR MIND IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE CALM EMPHASIZE EXHALS AND THE SIMPLEST WAY TO DO THIS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ME SAY IT THIS WILL BECOME IMMEDIATELY CLEAR IS TO EMPHASIZE EXHALS THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH TWO INHALES COD BE THROUGH THE NOSE OF MOUTH BUT IDEALLY THROUGH THE NOSE SO FOLLOWED BY A LONG EXHALE THOSE DOUBLE INHALES ARE KIND OF IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT THEY DO AS THEY MAXIMALLY FILL ALL THOSE LITTLE SACS IN YOUR LUNGS AND THEN WHEN YOU BREATHE OUT YOUR EXHALING AS MUCH OF THE SO CALL CARBONDOXIDE IN YOUR SYSTEM AS POSSIBLE WILL TALK ABOUT CARBONOXIDE A A SECOND SO THE FASTEST WAY TO CALM DOWN IS TO EMPHASIZE EXHALES WHEN YOU MAKE EXHAILES LONGER YOUR SLOWING YOUR HEARTRIGHT YOUR CALMING DOWN YOU DON'T NEED ANY SOPHISTICATED TRAINING YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS FOR MINUTES ON END YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHINGYOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CALL IT BREATH WORK IT'S JUST RESPIRATION AND IN FACT YOU DO THIS EVERY NIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP AND CARBONDOXIDE BUILDS UP TOO MUCH IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM OR IF YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH OR SOMETHING OR YOU WATCH AN ANIMAL OR A SMALL CHILD THAT SLEEPING THEY WILL OCCASIONALLY DO THESE DOUBLE INHALE LONG EXHALES ITS WAY OF SLOWING THE HEART DOWN AND ELIMINATING CARBONOXIDE THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE IF YOU INHALE DEEPLY OR VIGOROUSLY AND THEN EXHALE LESS LONG OR LESS VIGOROUSLY YOU WILL INCREASE YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS THROUGH THESE PURELY MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF YOUR INTEROSEPTION SO FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO TAKE A BIG DEEP INHALE AND THEN A SHORT EXAILE AND THE ANOTHER ONE BIG INHALE SHORT EXHAILE IT ONLY TAKES TWO OR THREE OF THOSE BEFORE YOU START TO FEEL MORE ALERT AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR HEARTRATE IS INCREASING AND ACTUALLY IF YOU KEEP DOING THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREATHS OF INHALE DEEP SHORT EXHALE YOU WILL START TO SECRETE A LOT OF A DRENOLING THIS HORMON THAT COMES FROM YOUR KIDNEYS AND FROM YOUR BRAINSTEM MAKE YOU FEEL REALLY ALERT YOU WILL ACTUALLY FEEL AS IF YOU'VE HAD A COUPLE OF SPRESSO YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY WAKE UP END THERE'S AN INTERMEDIATE FORM OF BREATHING WHICH IS SOMETIMES CALLED BOX BREATHING BUT IT'S REALLY EQUAL INHALE AND EXHALE DURATION AND THESE E BASELY GOS LIKE THIS YOU'LL YOU'RE GOING TO INHALES TO DO THIS FROM MAY BE TWO THREE SECONDS INHALE THEN HOLD TO THREE SECONDS THAN EXHALE TO THREE SECONDS THEN HOLD TO THREE SECONDS MUST OFTEN PEOPLE FORGET TO HOLD SO IT'S INHALE HOLD EXHALE HOLD FOR EQUAL OR MORE LESS EQUAL DURATIONS OF COULD BE ONE SECOND COULD BE TWO SECONDS COULD BE THREE SECONDS MOST PEOPLE FIND THT WHEN GET OUT PAST FIVE SECONDS THEY START TO STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN THE SO CALLD BOX BREATHING AND MOST PEOPLE CAN'T CONSCIOUSLY BOX BREATHE FOR TOO TERRIBLY LONG WITHOUT HAVING ATHINK ABOUT IT BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT THROUGH PURELY MECHANICAL MEANS CHANGING THE WAY THAT YOU BREATHE EMPHASIZING INHALES OR EXHAILES OR KEEPING THEM THE SAME WILL CHANGED THEWAY THAT YOUR BRAIN WORKS HOWLLERT YOU ARE AND HOW WELL YOU FUNCTION IN ANYTHING AND AGAIN THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT BREATHWORK HAS NO VALUE IS JUST SIMPLY TO SAY THAT LONG EXTENDED PROTOCALLS OF BREATH WORK ARE SIMPLY THEY ARE TRULY SIMPLY JUST IN EXPLORATION OF THIS FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MECHANICS OF YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS AND YOUR BRAIN AND HOLL YOUR BRAIN N CONTROLS THOSE INTERNAL ORGANS NOW YOU MIGHT ASK HOW IS THIS PRESSUR KNOWN HOW DOES THE BODY ACTUALLY KNOW HOW FULL THE LUNGS ARE NOW THIS IS A AN ANSWER THAT'S MORE FOR THE EFFICIONATOS OUT THERE BUT I HAVE HAD A FEW REQUESTS OR I SHOULD SAY THOUSANDS OF REQUEST FOR MORE IN DEPTH SCIENCE SO IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED MORE IN DEPT SCIENCE OF JUST A THIS WE'LLLOW YOU TO TONOU NOW FOR MAY BE JUST TEN SECONDS AND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED TAKE CAREFUL ATTENTION THERE IS A SET OF RECEPTRS WHICH ARE CALLED PIEZO RECEPTORS P IE Z O PIEZO RECEPTORS PIEZO MEANS PRESSURE AND THESE AR WERE DISCOVERED A FEW YEARS AGO BY A COUPLE DIFFERENT LABORATORIES BUT ONE OF THE MAIN ONE'S ONE OF THE MAIN LABORATORIES THAT DISCOVERED THESE PIEZO RECEPTORS IS THE LABORATORY OF ARDEM PADAPUCCHON AND OF SAYING HIS NAME EVEN TOUGH I PROULY MIS A PRONOUNCING IT HE'S A A FRIEND IN A FORMER COLLEAGUE WHEN MY LAB WAS DOWN IN SANDIEGO HE'S AT THE SCRIPTS INSTITUTE HIS A HOWARD HUS MEDICAL INSTITUTE INVESTIGATOR WHICH JUST SAYS WHOSE JUST BASILY MEANS THAT HE IS A TOTAL STUD OF SCIENCE AND HAS MADE MANY IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES THE PIEZO RECEPTORS LINE MANY TISSUES AND INFORM THE BRAIN ABOUT PRESSURE IN THOSE TISSUES BUT THE LUNGS HAVE A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF PIEZO RECEPTORS CALLED PIEZO TOO RECEPTORS AND AS YOU FILL YOUR LUNGS AND THESE LITTLE SACKS OF AIR THE EVIOLE FILL THE PIEZO TWO RECEPTORS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY REACT TO THAT FILLING SEND INFORMATION BY WAY OF A BUNCH OF NURONCS A BUNCH OF WIRES UP TO THE BRAIN AND TELL YOU HOW FUL YOUR LUNGS ARE SO THAT'S THE GUN A MECHANISTIC DETAIL FYOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT YOU CAN A LOOK UP ARDEM SLAB AT THE SCRIPTS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WORK THAT THEY AND OTHER LABORATORIES ARE DOING ON PIEZOS PIEZOS OR PRETTY COOL I THINK I ALSO DISLIKES SAYING PIEZO SO THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THAT UP AS WELL SO MECHANICAL SENSING OF THE LUNGS HEART AND DIAPHRAM AND NOW TLET'S TALK ABOUT CHEMICAL SENSING BECAUSE THERE'S CARBONDOXIDE AND THERE'S OXYGEN AND THIS IS REALLY SIMPLE YOU HAVE OXYGEN AND CARBONDOXIDE AND YOU NEED THEM BOTH I SOMETIMES HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CARBONDOXIDE IS THIS BAD THING AND OYGEN IT HAS A GOOD THING YOU NEED THEM BOTH AND YOU NEED THEM IN THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE YOU HAVE A COLLECTION OF NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT REGISTER WHEN CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS GET TO A CERTAIN POINT IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM WHEN THAT POINT THAT THRESHOLD IS REACHED THESE NARON'S FIRE AND THEY CAUSE YOU TO BREATHE THAT SOMETIMES CALLED THE GASP REFLECTS IT JUST MAKES YOU WANT INHALE AND AS HA CONSEQUENCE YOU BRING IN MORE OXYGEN IF SO WE DON'T REALLY BREATHE TO GET OXYGEN THAT'S A BY PRODUCT OF INHALING TO ELIMINATE CARBONDOXIDE YOU DON'T WANT CARBONDOXIDE LEVELS TO GO TOO HIGH IN FACT IF YOU WANT A FREAK SOMEBODY OUT AND WE DO THESE AN EXPERIMENTS AND I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS YOU JUST INCREASE THE LEVELS OF CARBONDOXIDE THAT THEY INHALE AND THE BRAIN WILL GO INTO AN ALMOST IMMEDIATE PIANIC RESPONSE BECAUSE THE HEALTH OF ALL AR TISSUES DEPENDS ON KEEPING A NICE BALANCE BETWEEN CARBONDOXIDE AND OXYGEN YOU DON'T WANT CARBON OXIDE LEVELS TO GO TOO HIGH SO THE IMPULSE TO BREATHE IF YOU'RE UNDER WATER OR IF YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH IS TRIGGERED BY THESE NURONS AND THE TRIGGERING OF THOSE NURONS COMES FROM ELEVATED CARBONE OXIDE IN THE BLOODSTREAM AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO CONCEPTIALIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BLOOD STREAM AN BREATH I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND MAY BYOU REMEMBER THIS FROM HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY BUT IF YOU DON'T I'LL MAKE IT CLEAR FOR YOU NOW IS VERY EASY YOU INHALE AIR AND THAT AIR AND THE OXYGEN MOLECULES IN THAT AIR ACTUALLY MOVE FROM YOUR LUNGS INTO THE BLOODSTREAM BECAUSE THESE LITTLE AVIOLY OF THE LUNGS THOSE LITTLE SAX OF AIR ARE IN THEY BASICALLY HAVE A LOT OF LITTLE MICRO VESSELS AND CAPILARIES LITTLE TINY BASICLLY BLOOD VESSELS ESSENTIALLY ALTHOUG THERE MOSTLY CAPALARIES MICROCAPALARIES IT LITE TINY ONES THAT LIND THEM SO THEREIS ACTUALLY AN INTERFACE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR AIR TO AND MOLECULES WITHIN THE AIR TO PASS INTO THE BLOOD AND THEN THEY MOVE IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM AND WHEN YOU EXHAIL THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE SO YOU CAN MOVE THINGS FROM THE AIR INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM OR FROM YOUR BLOODSTREAM INTO THE AIR BY WAY OF THE LUNGS AND THERE'S A LOT MORE DETAIL TO IT AND I'M SURE OF THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE EXPERTS OUT THERE IF YOU WANT TO PUT SOMESTUFF IN THE COMMENTS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN KIND OF INTERMEDIATE TUTORIAL YOU MIGHT EVEN TITLE IT INTERMEDIATE TUTORIAL IF YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS JUST A I'LL CHECK IT BUT MAKE SURE OU GET THE DETAILS RIGHT MIXTURY YOU KNOW THAT THE PROCESS AND A I FIND THAT FOR PEOLE THEYARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING HOW BREATHING REALLY WORKS IT'S REALLY NICE TO THING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HEART AND THE VASCULAR SYSTEM THE BLOOD AND THE AIR SYSTEM THE RESPIRATION SYSTEM AND BREATHING BECAUSE THOSE TWO THINGS ARE VERY A WE SAY THE'RE INTERGIGITATED THERE INTERWOVEN WITH ONE ANOTHER SO HAS THIS WORK WELL CARMONDOXIDE IS TOO HIGH YOU BREATHE IN YOU INSPIRE YOU INHAL YOU OFF AS A CONSEQUENCE WHEN YOU EXHAIL YOU OFF LOAD CARBONOXIDE THERE'S A REALLY COOL WAY THAT YOU CAN EXPLORE THIS CHEMISTRY OF YOUR BREATHING AND YOUR BLOOD STREAM IN THE WAY THAT YOUR BRAIN WORKS AND WAYS THAT CAN REALLY BENEFIT YOUR HEALTH NAND WORKS THE FOLLOWING WAY YOU WANT TO ESSENTIALLY SIT OR LIE DOWN DOESN'T REALLY MATTER YOU DEFINALLY DON'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE IN YOUR WATER NOT A BAT TO NOT A HOT TO NOT A YOU KNOW NOT A COLD DUNK OR SOMETHING IN FACT DON'T EVEN BE IN A PUDDLE AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN THIS CASE IS YOU'RE GOING TO BREATHE IN DEEP SO THATS CAN INCREASE YOUR HEART RATE AND THEN EXHAIL PASSIVELY BY JUST LETTING AIR FALL OUT OF YOUR MOUTH SO WLL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO IT SAY YOU BREATHE IN VIGOROUSLY AND THAN YOU LET THE AIR JUST FALL OUT OF YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU DO THAT WHAT YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY DOING IS YOUR BRINGING IN A LOT OF OXYGEN THROUGH THAT DEEP BREATH AND YOUARE EXHAILING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT CARBONA OXIDE BUT IF YOU WERE TO REPEAT IT TWENTY FIVE TIMES MAY BE THIRTY TIMES DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY SOMEWHERE IN THERE YOU WOULD ESSENTIALLY START BRINGING IN A LOT OF OXYGEN AND BLOWING OFF OR EXHAILING A LOT OF CARBONOXIDE SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO CHANGE THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE AND YOU CAN THEN SENSE IT YOU CAN INTEROCEPT WHAT THAT IS LIKE AND THERE SOME REALLY INTERESTING REASONS FOR WANTING TO DO THAT SO NO CAN T DO ALL TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY NOW MAYBE DO FIVE OR TENS YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE SO THAT IT'S CLEAR I'M IN I ESSENTIALY DEMONSTRATE NOW SO IT'S INHAIL EXHAIL THROUGH THE MOUTH I AM INHILLING THROUGH THE NOSE SO IT'S SENTUALL EXCUSE ME A TWO TWO SECOND OR SO INHAL AND THEN I ONE SECOND OR SO EXHAILE AND AS I WAS DOING THAT I CAN CONT OF FEEL MY FACE GET FLUSH AND MY BODY IS HEATING UP IN MY BRAIN IS HEATING UP WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE WELL THAT PATTERN OF BREATHING IS INCREASING LEVELS OF A DRENOLINE IN MY BRAIN AND BODY AND I'M GETTING MORE ALERT THEN AFTER TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY OF THOSE YOU EXHAIL ALL YOUR AIR YOU DUMP ALL YOUR AIR CAN YOU THAT YOUR NOSE OR YOUR MOUTH AND THEN YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH WITH YOUR LUNGS EMPTY FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN TO THIRTY SECONDS NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT TO EXPLORE THIS AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL AS YOU EXPLORE THIS DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID LIKE DO THIS WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN EXHAIL ALL YOUR AIR AND WHAT YOU'LL FIND THEN AS YOU CAN HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THE REASON YOU CAN DO THAT IS BECAUSE YOU'VE BLOWN OFF ALL THE CARBON DIOXIDE OR MOST OF THE CARBONOXIDE IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM SO YOU'VE SHIFTED THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR BLOOD BY BREATHING IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND BY DOING THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER TRIGGERING THESE NURONS THAT CAUSE THE GASP REFLEXT OR THE REFLEXT TO BREATHE NOW OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BREATHE SOONER OR LATER BUT WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS IF NORMALLY YOUR ABILITY TO HOLD YOUR BREATH IS A MINUTE OR SO BEFORE YOU REALLY FEEL THAT GASP REFLEX KICKEN YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOU CAN GO NINETY SECONDS ORE TWO MINUTES AND WITH SOME PRACTICE PEOPLE FIND THAT THEY CAN START HOLDING THEIR BREATH FOR THREE OR FOUR MINUTES OR LONGER THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW FREE DIVERS DO WHAT THEY DO I DO NOT WANT ANY ONE FREE DIVING IF YOU CAN LEARN FREE DIVING PRE PLEASE LEARN IT FROM AN EXPERT A MANY PEOPLE DIE TRYIN TO TEACH THEMSELVES OUT OF FREE DIVE OR DRIN TO TEACH THE FRIENDS OUT OF FREEDIVE WHEN THEY DON'T KNW WHAT THEY'RE OING THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT DON'T AGAIN DON'T DO THIS ANYWHERE NEAR WATER BUT IT IS A VERY INTERESTING EXPLORATION OF HOW YOU CAN SHIFT THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR BLOOD STREAM BY MODULATING YOUR AIR BY MODULAING THE MECHANICS OF YOUR DIE FRIM AND LUNGS AND THEREBY SHIFT THE WAY YOUR MIND WORKS YOUR BRAIN IN FACT WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE IS THAT EVEN THOUGH DURING THAT TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREATHS YOU'LL FEEL VERY ALERT WHEN YOU EXHAIL ALL YOUR IR AND YOU'RE IN THE BREATH HOLD YOU WILL FEEL VERY ALERT BUT VERY VERY CALM NOW THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S A STATE THAT WE ALL SORT OF WANT TO ACHIEVE ALERT BUT CALM BUT HAVE A HARD TIME ACHIEVING AND SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE A HARD TIME OBTAINING FOCUS FOR SAKE OF WORK OR FOCUS FOR SAKE OF ANYTHING I SHOULD SAY AND WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE FOCUS IS THROUGH THE USE OF THINGS LIKE STIMULANS ARE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE OCOLD SHOWER OR ICE BATHOR YOU HAVE TO HAVE FORESPRESSO IN ORDER TO BE ALERT BUT THEN YOUR TOO ALERT YOUR GITTERY YOU CAN'T FOCUS THIS PATTERN OF BREATHING CAN LEND ITSELF VERY WELL TO ENTERING STATES OF ALERT BUT CALM FOR THE FALLE THE TEN OR EVENTWENTY MINUTES THAT FOLLOW THAT BREATHING AND THEN YOU COULD REPEAT IT IF YOU WANT SO IT'S A VERY USEFUL PRACTICE TO EXPLORE SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PRACTICE AND SO CALLED WHIM HOFF BREATHING WHIMHOFF IS A PRACTITION ER OF WHAT'S CALLED TUMO BREATHING TUMO BREATHING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR CENTURIES AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH BREATH WORK AND A OGET PRACTICES I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOTHING I JUST DESCRIBED IS NEW BASED ON SCIENCE HOWEVER THE SCIENCE INFORMS WHY THOSE PRACTICES WORK AND JUST AS A LITTLE MEANI EDITORIAL I JUST ONE EMPHASIZE AS WELL THAT ONE THING THAT THIS PODCAST IS REALLY ABOUT IS TRYING TO REMOVE FANCY NOMING CLATURE WHETHER NOT IS YOGIC NOMINCLATURE OR SCIENTIFIC NOMING CLA JURES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS PROTOCALS BECAUSE THE MOMENT WE START NAMING THINGS AFTER PEOPLE OR CALLING THEM TUMO ET CETERA I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT IT DOESN'T INFORM HOW THE PRACTICSS ARE DONE NOR DOES IT INFORM THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS SO HERE OM TRYNG TO TEACH YOU THE MECHANISMS AND AS A FINAL POINT TO THAT THE MOST POWERFUL FORM OF BREATHING IS THE ONE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS THAT IN ELLSE INCREASE HEART RATE THAT EXHAILS DECREASE HEART RATE AND THAT CARBONDOXIDE AND OXYGEN RELATE TO THE BLOODSTREAM AND THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR WAYS ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE COMPONENTS THEN YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN SO CALLED BREATHWORK PRACTICES YOU CAN BREATHE IN THE WAYS THAT BEST SERVE YOU AS OPPOSED TO THINKING THT ONE PROTOCAOL IS THE BEST AR WHOLLY PROTOCOL FOR EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT SIMPLY NOT AS A FINAL FINAL POINT I WANT TO SAY THAT AS YOU SHIFT THE WAY THAT YOU BREATHE WHETHER NOT YOUR BLOWING OFF MORE CORMODOXIDE ARE BRINGING IN MORE OXYGEN YOU ARE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR INTERNAL MILIU OF YOUR BODY AND THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON THE WAY THAT OUREMIUN SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND THE WAY THAT YOU DEAL WITH INFLAMMATION AND ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SORT OF A THINGS THAT CAN ENTER YOUR BODY AND CAUSE PROBLEMS OR CONDITIONS OF STRASS ET CETERA SO I WILL EXPLORE THAT FURTHER AS THE EPISODE GOES ON BUT I WANT O MOVE ON TO JUST TOUCH ON ONE OTHER ASPECT OF BREATHING THAT'S PURELY MECHANICAL WHICH I THINK IS VERY INTERESTING AN IMPORTANT WHICH RELATES TO A PARTICULAR REFLEX THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY FAMILIAR WITHIN A SECOND AND THAT CAN SERVE YOU VERY WELL IN TIMES OF EXTREME STRESS THE REFLECTS ON REFERRING TO IS SOMETHING CALLED THE HERRING BREWER REFLEX NOWM NOT GOING GO INTO DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE HERRING BREER RE FLECTS WORKS BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH PARTICULAR CLASSES OF NURONS AND SELLS THAT ARE CALLED BARRO RECEPTORS THOSE ARE BASICALLY PRESSURE RECEPTORS THEY SENSE PRESSURE AND BASICALLY WHAT THE HERRYING BREWER REFLECTS IS ABOUT IS THAT WHEN YOUR LUNG IS INFLATED YOURE DESIRE TO BREATHE IS REDUCED S YOU CAN TRY THAT RIGHT NOW YOU CAN INHAL HUGE U BEAR AND HOLD OC YOUR DESIRE TO BREATHE WILL KICK IN LATER THEN WERE YOU TO EXHAL ALL YOUR AIR AND HOLD YOUR BREATH WHEN YOU EXHAL ALL YOUR AIR AND HOLD YOUR BREATH UNLESS YOU'VE DONE THE SORT OF PROTOCALL I DESCRIBED A FEW MINUTES AGO OF DOING A BUNCH OF INHALS AND EXAILES FIRST IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY YOU WILL FEEL EMPTY THOSE BARO RECEPTORS ARE GOING TO BE FIRING LIKE CRAZY TING THERE'S NO PRESSURE IN YOURE THERE'S NO PRESSURE NOT GOT NOTHING IN HERE YOU NEED TO BREATHE YOU NEED TO BREATHE IN THE GASP REFLECTS WILL KICK IN SOONER YOU CAN APPLY THAT IN ALL SORTS OF SITUATIONS RELATED TUE EXERCISE RELATED TUBE MODULATING STRESS ET CETERA SO THE HERRING BREWER REFLECTS IS A VERY POWERFUL ONE THIS IS WHY YOU TAKE A BIG DEEP BREATH BEFORE YOU GO UNDER WATER  IGHT YOU'RE NOK AN EXHAL ALL YOUR AIR AND GO UNDER WATER IF YOU WERE TO EXHAL ALL YOUR IR AN GO UNDER WATER YOU WOULD ABSOLUTELY FEEL THE NEED TO COME UP SOONER FOR A BREATH OF AIR THAN HAD YOU A FULL TANK SO TO SPEAK A FULL AF LUNGS FULL OF AIR AND THIS IS ALSO THE WAY THAT PEOPLE TEACH THEMSELVES TO FEEL COMFORTABLE UNDER UNDER WATER SO WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO SWIM YOU LEARN NOW TO SWIM BOTH BY HAVING AIR IN YOUR LUNGS WHILE YOU'R UNDER WATER AND NO AIR IN YOUR LUNGS WHILE YOUR UNDER WATER IN ANY EVENT THE HERING BREWER REFLECTSES YET ANOTHER DIMENSION TO THE WAY THAT MECHANICAL PRESSURE INFLUENCES YOUR BRAINS DECISION MAKING ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR BODY IN THIS CASE WHEATHER R NOT TO BREATH SO NOW I WANT TO SHIFT AWAY FROM BREATHING AND DIAPHRAM AND LUNGS AND MOVE TOWARD ANOTHER ORGAN WITHIN OUR VICERA WHICH IS OUR GOT THIS INCLUDES OUR STOMACH IN OUR INTESTINS ARE SOPHAGISTS AND SO FORTH IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE BOTH BY ME AND BY OTHERS THAT WE ARE BUT A SERIES OF TUBES AND INDEED THAT TRUBE BELIVE IT ARE NOT EVERY SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY IS A TUBE YOUR BRAIN IS ACTUALLY A TUBE THAT CONNECTS YOUR SPINAL CORTER WHICH IS ALSO A TUBE YOU START IT OFF AS A TUBE YOU WARE LIKE A TURO YOU KNOW THOSE LETUROS ION'T IF YOUR NOT FAMILIAR TUROS THERE LIKE A DOGHNUTS THAT ARE SHAPED LIKE A TUBE THAT SUSCENTIALY WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT NOT LONG AFTER CONCEPTION AND THE FRONT END OF THAT TURO GREW AND GREW IND GREBE BUT YOU ALWAYS MAINTAIND A HOLLOW THROUGH THAT TUBE THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED VENTRICLES GAPS OR A SPACE IN YOUR BRAIN AND SPINAL COURT THAT RUN THE LENGTH OF YOUR BRAIN IN SPINALCORT AND FLUID CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID ANOTHER THINGS MOVE THROUGH THAT SPACE WE'RE GONGTO RETURN TO THE VENTRICLES LAYER THEARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT THEY'RE JUST SPACE FILLED WITH FLUID BUT THEY DO A LOT SIMILARLY YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM STARTS WITH THE TUBE AT YOUR MOUTH AND COURSE GOES DOWN THROUGH YOUR THROAT AND THEN YOU'VE GOT ALL THE ELEMENTS O THE STOMACH AND THE INTESTINS AND THEN IT COMES OUT THE OTHER END YOU ARE BUT A SERIES OF DIFFERENT TUBES YOUR VASCULAR SYSTEM A SERIES OF OTHER TUBES SO YOUR TUBES THE WAY YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM WORKS IS TO COMMUNICATE TO YOUR BRAIN ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE MECHANICAL PRESSURES ALONG THIS TUBE SO WITHIN YOUR STOMACH IN YUR INTESTINS ET CETERA AND THE CHEMICAL STATUS OF THAT TUBE AT VARIOUS PORTIONS WITHIN THAT TUBE TO INFORM YOUR BRAIN ABOUT HOW YOUR BRAIN SHOULD CONTROL THAT TUBE SO LET'S START WITH THE MECHANICAL SENSING OF YOUR GUT IF YOU DRINK A LOT OF FLUID OR IF YOU EAT A LOT OF FOOD YOUR GUT WILL FILL UP YOUR STOMACH WILL FILL UP WITH FOUBE NOW IT GETS DIGESTED THERE GETS DIGESTED ELSEWHERE ALONG YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT TUE OF COURSE BUT IT STARTS GETTING DIGESTEVE THERE BECAUSE ALONG THIS TUBE YOU HAVE A SERIES OF WHAT ARE CALLED SPHINCTERS WHICH BASICLY ARE LIKE LITTLE DRAWPULLS IF YOU EVER HAD A LAUNGRY BAGUAGE HAS A DRAW STRING ON IT YOU PULL IT AND THEN IT SINCHES SHUT AND THEN YOU CAN OPEN AGAIN THAT'S WHAT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SPHINCTER OPENINGS AND YOU HAVE THEM IN YOUR THROAT YOU HAVE THEM A LONGOR DIGESTIVE TRACT ALL THE WAY THE END FOOD WILL ENTER YOUR GUT AND IF THERE'S A LOT OF THAT FOOD PRESSURE RECEPTORS SOME OF WHICH ARE THESE PIEZ O RECEPTORS WILL COMMUNIT COMMUNICATE TO THE AREAS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN FEEDING AND WILL SAY DON'T EAT ANY MORE YOU DON'T NEED TO CONSUME ANY MORE NOW SOME PEOPLE BY PASS THAT THESE A I GUESS THEY HAVE THESE LIKE HOTDOG EAT IN COMPETITIONS AM ALWAYS STRUCK BY HOW SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE LIKE SEEM TO BE RAIL THIN BUT THEY ACTUALLY TRAIN FOR THOSE COMPETITIONS BY INGESTING LARGE VOLUMES OND WATER I SH HA VERY DANGEROUS PRACTICE YOU CAN ECTALLY KILL YOURSELF BY DRINKING TOO MUCH WATER AND YOU CAN KILL YOURSELF BY INGESTING TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING REALLY TO EXPAND YOUR GUT NOT A GOOD PRACTICE NOT A BIG FAN OF THOSE COMPETITIONS BUT EVEN IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE OR YEAR THE WORLD HAVY WAI CHAMPIONS OF THEM THEY ARE INFORMATIVE TOWARD WHAT I 'M TALKING ABOUT NOW WHICH IS THAT AS YOU EXPAND THE GUT A SIGNAL IS SENT BY NURONS LITERALLY NERVE CELLS THAT ARE IN THE GUT TO THE BRAIN STEM UP TO THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN FEEDING I DID WHOLE EPISODE ON FEEDING YOU CAN FIND ON FEEDING METABOLISM AND HUNGER YOU'RE WELCOME TO TOLISTEN THAT EPISODE IF YOU LIKE AND WILL SHUT DOWN THE NURONS THAT DRIVE THE DESIRE TO PUT MORE STUFF IN YOUR MOUTH THAT THING THAT PEOPLE SAY SOMETIMES ON ON THIS COUNTRY FREQUENTLY AFTER THANKSGIVING MEAL I CAN'T PUT ANOTHER BITE IN MY MOUTH LITERALLY THEY SHUT DOWN SOME OF THE BASIC MOVEMENTS OF THE MUSCULATURE TO TAKE ANOTHER FORK BITE I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT THEY CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL YOUR BRAINS SO YOUR GUT IS SO FULL THAT IT'S CONTROLLING YOUR BRAIN SUCH THAT THIS ACTION OF SPOONING FOOD TOWARDS YOUR MOUTH IS ACTUALLY INHIBITID IT'S MADE MORE DIFFICULT OR LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR IT'S INCREDIBLE THE CONVERSE IS ALSO TRUE WHEN THESE PIEZO RECEPTOR SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN THAT THE GUT IS EMPTY INDEPENDENT OF YOUR NEED YOUR ACTUAL NEED FOR FOOD THERE'S A SIGNAL THAT SENT YOUR BRAIN THAT SAYS GUT IS EMPTY AND NURONS GET STIMULATED IN AREAS LIKE THE ARCU AT NUCLEAS AND THESE AREAS THE HYPOTHALMAS ET CETERA THAT DRIVE THE DESIRE TO MAKE THIS ACTION TO OPEN THE MOUTH AND TO PUT STUFF IN IT IN PARTICULAR FOOD SO WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF AT THE REFRIGERATOR OR YOU FIND YOURSELF ALMOST YOU NOMANICALLY TRYING TO GET FOOD OF DIFFERENT KINDS YOU'RE NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE EATING BECAUSE YOU'RE SO HUNGRY IN PART THAT'S BECAUSE THE LACK OF FOOD IN YOUR GUT HAS SENT THAT INFORMATION TO YOUR BRAIN AND IS DRIVING PARTICULAR FIXED ACTION PATTERNS THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH EATING IN FACT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS CHILDREN LEARN HOW TO DO IS OPEN THEIR MOUTH WHEN SOMETHING IS PRESENTED TO IT AND THEN THEY LEARN HOW TO MOVE A SPOON OR A FORK THIY'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT FIRST THEY GET ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT EVENTUALLY THEY GET GOOD ATT LEAST MOST PEOPLE GET GOD IF YOU WATCH OUT PEOPLE EAT YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF VERY VERIABLE OUT THERE IN ANY EVENT THIS IS A PURELY MECHANICAL PHENOMENON AND THIS PURELY MECHANICAL PHENOMENON IS DRIVING OUR BRAIN TO DRIVE CERTAIN BEHAVIOR YOU CAN GET BETTER AT REGISTERING SENSE OF FULNESS OR LACK OF FULNESS IN A VERY PARTICULAR WAY SOME PEOPLE HAVE A VERY KEEN SENSE OF HOW FULL OR EMPTY THEI'RE STOMACH IS SO IF YOU'VE EATEN ANYTHING EVEN IF IT'S A SMALL VOLUME OF FOOD IN THE LAST HOUR TO THREE HOURS IT'S ACTUALY O WORTH WHILE PRACTICE TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS MAY BE TEN TWENTY SECONDS AND ACTUALLY JUST TRYING CONCENTRATE ON SENSING THE NURANS IN YOUR GUT AND HOW FULL YOU ARE LIKE FOR INSTANCE I AT A FEW HOURS AGO THAN I HAD A LITTLE SNACK ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AGO OR SO AND MY GUT FEELS NEITHER TERRIBLY FULL NOR TERRIBLY EMPTY IT S KIND OF I WOULD PUT AT KIND OF LIKE THIRTY FORTY PER CENT SO BY JUST CTAKING CONSCIOUS AWARENESS OF HOW FULL OR EMPTY ARE GUT IS AT VARIOUS TIMES BETWEEN MEALS AFTER A MEAL BEFORE A MEAL YOU CAN VERY QUICKLY DEVELOP A SENSE OF HOW FULL OR EMPTY YOU ARE NOW WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS ACTUALLY RATHER INTERESTING IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS ACTUALLY THAT YOU CAN BETTER OVERRIDE THE SIGNALS OF THESE PIEZO RECEPTORS AND GOT FULNESS OR EMPTINESS SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT FIND THAT YOU EAT KIND OF A COMPULSIVELY OR OR NONCONSCIOUSLY OR SUBCONSCIOUSLY I SHOULD SAY PROBLY HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS ENOUGH TO BE AWAIT TO EAT BUT SUBCONSCIALLY YOU JUST FIND YOURSELF EATING AND HERE I'M DESCRIBING MYSELF AND  I MU DRIVE BY BLUEBERRY EATER IF THERE'S A BOWL OF BLUEBERRIES EVERY TIME I WALK PAST THAT I SOR OF HAVE TO GRAB AHANDFUL THEM POP THEM IN MY MOUTH BUT IF YOU DEVELOP THIS SENSE OF HOW MUCH MECHANOC PRESSURE S NOT REALLY A WORD BUT HOW MUCH MECHANO SENSATION IS IN YOUR GUT VERY QUICKLY YOU CAN LEARN TO OVERRIDE THAT YOU MIGHT ASK WHY WHATD I WANT TO BE ABLE TO OVERRIDE WHETHER NOT MY STOMACH IS EMPTY OUR MY STOMACH IS FULL WELL THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO WANT TO DO THAT MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE INTERESTED IN S L ALLED INTERMITAN FASTING THEY'RE DOING FASTS OF ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE TO SIXTEEN HOURS EVERY TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE S I SHALLY WHAT MY PRACTICE IS I DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS SOMETIMES YAT  BREAKFAST BUT NORMAL AMPPUSH BREAKFAST OUT TILL ABOUT ELEVEN OR NOON OR SOMETIMES A LITTLE LATER SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING LONGER FAST AND THERE ARE REALLY WONDERFUL DATA PUBLISHED IN EXCELLENT JOURNALS FROM MY COLLEGUE SOCH IN PENDA AT THE A SALT INSTITUTOF BIOLOGICAL STUDIES AND OF COURSE FROM OTHER LABORATORIES SHOWING THAT INTERMITTENFASTING CAN AND WILL HAVE SOME POSITIVE HEALTH EFFECTS ON THINGS LIKE LIVER HEALTH AND BRAIN HEALTH AND OTHER ASPECTS OF HEALTH WHETHER NOT IT'S THE BEST FORM OF DIETING FOR THE SAKE OF LOSING WEIGHT THAT'S VERY CONTROVERSIAL BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT HAVING A PERIOD OF FASTING EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOUROR PERHAPS EVEN LONGER FROM TIME TO TIME CAN BE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE IT STIMULATES WHAT'S CALLED AUTOPHAGY THE CLEARING AWAY OR THE THE BODIES ABILITY TO EAT CERTAIN DEAD CELL SO CALLED SENESIN CELLS AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY STRUGGLE WITH FASTING BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY HAVE A VERY KEEN SENSE OF THEIR STOMACH BEING EMPTY AND THEY FEEL AS IF THEY HAVE TO EAT AND IN A KIND OF COUNTER INTUITIVE WAY THERE SOME DATA THEY INDICATE THAT BEING ABLE TO SENSE WHETHER NOT YOUR GOT IS FULL OR EMPTY AND JUST THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT'S COMMUNICATING INFORMATION TO YOUR BRAIN ABOUT WHETHER NOT TO EAT OR NOT JUST THAT AWARENESS THAT UNDERSTANDING ALLOWS THEM TO OVERRIDE THE SIGNAL THEY THINK OH YOU KNOW I'M NOT ACTUALLY IN NEED OF NEUTRIENTS RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST THAT MY STOMACH IS EMPTY AND THESE A PIZA RECEPTERS AND SOME OTHER ONES THAT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IN IT IN A MOMENT ARE SIGNALING TO MY BRAIN THAT IT'S EMPTY I DON'T ACTUALLY NEED FOOD IT'S JUST PAY IT'S JUST THAT MY BRAIN IS REACTING TO THE FACT THAT MY GUT IS A DEFLATED SO TO SPEAKOR SMALLER DOESN'T HAVE FOOD IN IT SO THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT OUR GUTS COMMUNICATE WITH OUR BRAIN IT'S NOT JUST OUR STOMACH TALKING TO OUR BRAIN IT'S ALSO OUR INTESTINS TALK TO OUR BRAIN THE LEEBERLYS LAB THE GODS NAME IS STEVEN LIBERLEES YO RUNS ALAB AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOLS TERRIFIC LAB DOES EXCELLENT WORK ON GUT BRAIN COMMUNICATION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF VICERA BRAIN COMMUNICATION THEY DISCOVERED A CATEGORY OF NURONS CALL THE GEOL PE ONE AR NURONS THESE ARE NURONS THAT ARE BASICALLY IN IN YOUR NECK I MEAN THE PART OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT THEIR YOU CAN THEY CAN BE FOUND NEAR YOUR NECK THOSE NURON SEN LITTLE WIRES DOWN INTO THE INTESTINS AND DEEP INTO THE STOMACH BUT MOSTLY INTO THE INTESTINS AND THEY SENT STRETCH OF YOUR INTESTNS SO THIS IS PRETTY WILD THESE NURON SENSE HOW STRETCHED OUT YOUR INTESTINS ARE AND HOW FAST THINGS ARE MOVING THROUGH YOUR INTESTINS SLOW OR FAST OR IF THERE'S NOTHING THERE AND THEN THOSE NURONS SEND ANOTHER BRANCH THEY HAVE A BRANCH IN ONE DIRECTION SENSIS WHAT'S GOING ON YOUR INTESTINS AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER BRANCH THAT GOES UP FROM YOUR NECK IN YOUR BRAIN TO EITHER TRIGGER THE DESIRE TO EAT MORE OR TO STOP EATING SHESE ARE REALLY RALLY COOL NURNS AND THEIR BASILY STRETCH ORSCEPTORS THEY LOOK A LOT LIKE THE PIEZO RESEPTORS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE SO THESE GOL PE ONE ARE NURONS ARE SENSING STRETCH SO PURELY MECHANICAL SENSING AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THE LEBERLES LAV DISCOVERED NURONS THAT DETECT NUTRIANTS THEMSELVES NOW THE MAIN REASON WHY WE NEAN TO EAT IS TO BRING NUTRANS INTO OUR BODY AND THERE IS ANOTHER ST OF NURONS THOSE ARE CALLED G PIAR SIX FIVE NURONS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE T REMEMBER THAT THAT DO THE SAME THING IN TERMS OF THEIR CONNECTIONS THEY SEND CONNECTIONS DOWN INTO THE INTESTINS AND INTO THE GUT INTO THE STOMACH BUT MOSTLY INTO THE INTESTINS AND THEN SEND THAT IN FORMATION BACK UP TO THE BRAIN AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE CERTAIN KINDS OF NUTRIANTS IN OUR DIGESTIVE TRACK NOW THESE NURONS OF THE ONES TO PAY ATTENTION TO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHEMICAL SIGNALLING AND IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT HOW YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HUNGER AND HAW O MODULATE YOUR HUNGER FOR THE RIGHT FOODS IN FACT FOR HEALTHY FOODS THE WAY THIS IS DONE IS BY LEVERAGING THE ACTIVITY OF THESE G P R SIX FIVE NURONS THESE NURONS THAT SENTS NUTRIANTS OCE THEIR TELLING YOUR BRAIN WHAT'S IN YOUR GUT AND INTESTINS AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER SET OF NURONS THAT WERE DISCOVERED BY ANOTHER GUI HE'S OUT AT DUKE UNIVERSITY HIS NAME IS DIE DIEGO SCUSE ME DIEGO DIEGO BORCES AS THE HESE A WONDERFUL SCIENTISTS HE HAS A DEGREE IN NUTRICIAN BUT ALSO IN NURO SCIENCE AND HE FOUND THAT THERE ARE NURONS THAT LINE THE GUT AND THOSE NURONS INCOLLABORATION WITH THESE G PIAR SIX FIVE NURONS ARE CENSING FOR THREE THINGS CASSO WE SAY NUTRIANTS WHICH NEUTRIANTS ARE THEY LOOKING FOR WHAT ARE THESE NURONS PAYINTENTION TO WELL THESE NURONS ARE ACTIVATED BY THE PRESENCE OF FATTY ACIDS IN PARTICULAR OMEGA THREE FATTYACIDS SORTS OF THINGS THAT COME FROM FADTY FISH FISH OIL CRILL CERTAIN KINDS OF ANIMAL PROE ANIMAL AND PLANT A SUBSTANCES YOU CAN LOOK UP WHAT HAS A LOT OF OMEGATHREES AND THOSE OMEGATHREES MAKE THESE NURNS FIRE ELECTRICALLY LIKE CRAZY UP TO THE BRAIN AND MAKE YOU WANT TO EAT MORE OF THOSE THINGS BUT IT TURNS OUT IN PRETTY APPROPRIATE LEVELS THESE NURONS ALSO RESPOND TO A MENOACIDS SO WHEN YOU EAT OF FOOD IT'S BROKEN DOWN IN THE GUT A SHAL THE WAY IT'S BROKE DOWN THE GUT IS KOND INTERESTING YOUR GUT BASICALLY CINCHES OFF A SPHINCTER UP TOP SCINCHES OFF A SPHINCTER ON BELOW IT WHEN THERE'S FOOD THERE AND THEND YOU HAVE A SERIES OF SMOOTH MUSCLES THAT TUMBLE THE FOOD AND LITERALLY PHYSICALLY BREAK IT DOWN AND THEN OF COURSE ENZIMES COME IN AND START DIGESTING THE FOOD AND OREGAN A TALK ABOUT DIGESTION AND HOW THAT'S COMMUNICATED TO THE BRAIN IN A MOMENT AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH ANY AUTUMUMUNE ISSUES OR DIGESTIVE ISSUES TIS CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BUT MEANWHILE THERE THESE NURONS IN THE GUT AND AS THESE FATYACIDS FLOAT OUT OF THE DIGESTED FOOD SO LITERALLY FAT MOLECULES AND AS A MINOACIDS ARE COMING FROM THE PROTINES AS THEIR DIGESTED IN THE GUT AND AS A THIRD FOOD ITEM SUGARS ARE COMING FROM THE FOODS THAT WE EAT THESE NURONS WILL FIRE A L OT TO THE BRAIN THAT SAYS HEY WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING UP THERE DO MORE OF IT OKE NOW THE SUGARS ARE A LITTLE BUT CRIPTIC BECAUSE WHEN I SAY SUGARS OR I SAY A MINO ACIDS OR I SAY FATTY ACIDS THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TASTE IN FACT BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE BORTES LAB AND BY OTHER LAVS SHOWING THAT EVEN IF YOU NUMB THE MOUTH EVEN IF YOU GAVAGE WHICH IS A REALLY JUST AT IT'S A FANCY WORD FOR BASICALLY TO FEEDING YOU PUT A TUBE DOWN IN TH GET YOU TO DELIVER THE FOOD TO THE GUTS YOU GET NO OPPORTUNITY TO TASTE IT SOUNDS PRETTY AWFUL YOU FORCE FEED BY GAVAGE OR YOU NUMB THE MOUTH THESE NURONS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MOUTH THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THE NEUTRIENCE COMING FROM THESE FOODS AND THEN THEY SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN HEY DO THAT THING DO THAT THING WHERE YOU LIFT THAT OBJECT WE CALL A FORK OR A SPOON DO THAT THING WHERE YOU DRINK THE MILK SHAKE DO THAT THING WHERE YOU MOVE YOUR MOUTH LIKE THIS NOT TALKING BUT DO THAT THING WHERE YOU SWALLOW SO THAT'S HOW THE NEUTRIENCE AN ARE GOT CONTROL US AND THIS IS WHY FOR PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE EXTREME SUGAR CRAVINGS OR EVEN MILD SUGAR CRAVINGS REPLACING THOSE FOODS WITH FOODS THAT HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF O MAGA THREE OR A MINO ACIDS CAN PRODUCE SUGAR CRAVINGS AND IVE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT IF YOU DIDN'T CATCH IT IN O BIDEAL I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE THE SOLUTION TO SUGAR CRAVINGS IS TO INJEST A SMALL AMOUNT MAY BE A TEASPOON OR SO OF AN EMINO ACID CALLED GLUDOMINE AND IF YOUR HAVE REALLY EXTREME SUGAR CRAVINGS YOU CAN EVEN MIX THAT GLUDOMINE WITH A FULL FAT CREAM JASHY MAKES AT TASTE PRETTY DARN GOOD AND YOU DRINK THAT ANY TIME YOU HAVE A SUGAR CRAVING OF JUST A SIP OR TWO OF THAT AND WE FIND IT THAT THE SUGAR CRAVINGS DISAPPEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALY GIVING FAT AND A MINO ACIDS TO THOSE NURONS IN THE GOT AND IN THE INTESTANT THE SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN YOU WANT MORE NOW THIS DOESN'T GIVE YOU A KIND OF RUN AWAY HUNGAR FOR FOR FULLFAT CREAM ALTHOUGH WE'LL SAY WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR A VARIOUS REASONS BUT MOST LBECAUSE I LIKE THO WAY TASTE I I WAS USING HALF AND HALF IN MY CERIOL AND I WAS DAWAKEN UP THE MILL NIGHT IN DRINKING HALF AND HALF AND THAT STUFF TASTE PRETTY DARN GOOD WONCE YOU GET USED TO THE HIGH FAT CONTENT NOT SOMETHING I DO NOW BUT THE POINT IS THESE NURONS DON'T REALLY NO TASTE THEY ONLY KNOWN NEUTRIANS AND SO YOU CAN WORK WITH THAT SYSTEM IF YOUR IF YOU CRAVE SUGAR AND I DO BELIEVE THAT MOST IF NOT ALL OF US SHOULD BE TRYING TO LIMIT IF NOT A LIMINATE SIMPLE SUGARS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE MOST OF THE TIME THEN THINGS LIKE GLUDOMINE THINGS LIKE HIO MAGA THREE FOODS ET CETERA MAY BE EVEN WANT TO SUPPLEMENT WITH FISHOIL OR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO GET A MEGA THREES THERE ARE OTHER REASONS FOR WANT TO DO THAT TOO CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL AND HEARS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IN TERECEPTION IT'S YOUR ABILITY TO SENSE YOUR INNER REAL ESTATE BUT IN THIS CASE BY WAY OF CHEMICAL SIGNALLING NOT BY WAY OF MECHANICAL SIGNALLING SO NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER ASPECT OF GOT CHEMISTRY THAT HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AS WELL AS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH AUTOMOMUNE CONDITIONS OR FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT NO PEOPLE WITH AUTOOMUNE CONDITIONS THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION YOUR GUT NEEDS TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ACIDITY OR ALKALINITY FOR THOSE OF YOU WITHOUT ANY CHEMISTRY BACKGROUND BASICALLY THE LOW NUMBERS ON THE PH SCALE THAT MENS MORE ACITIC THE HIGHER THAN NUMBERS MORE ALKALINE SO MORE ALKLINE MEANS MORE BASIC AN ACIDIC MEANS ACITIC AN ACTIDO WITH NO MORE HYDROGEN ATUMS AN ALLSO THEIR STUFP IT YOU DON'T NEAN TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RAIGHT NOW WHERE NOT CIN A PHE YOU'RE GUT RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARGON TO TALK ABOUT THE P H OF YOUR GUT YOU'RE GUT NEEDS TO BE MORE ACIDIC THAN ESSENTIALLY ALL OTHER TISSUES OF YOUR BODY IN ORDER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY BACTERIA THRIVE IN ALKALINE CONDITIONS I THNK THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PEOPLE ALWAYS THINKING OH YOU SHOULD BE MORE ALKALINE BEING ACIDIC THAT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE A BEING INFLAMED IT WELL YOU KNOW IT'S A COMPLICATE DISCUSSION BUT I THINK THE SEMANTICS CAN BE CONFUSING SOMETIMES YOU WANT YOUR GUT TO BE ACITIC YOU MAY ASK WHAT WIRE PEOPLE TAKING ANTIACIDS WELL THOSE ANTIACIDS ARE THERE FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE TO ESSENTIALLY COMBAT ACID REFLUX WHICH IS THE CENDING UP OF STUFF IN THE GUT TOWARDS THE ASOPHAGUS AN IT CAN CAUSE HEARTBURN IND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND THE WAY THAT ANTIACIDS WORK IS THEY ASSENTIALLY CAUSE THE SPHINCTERS ABOVE THE GUT TO CINCH SHUT BUT THEY REALLY ARE ONLY DEALING WITH ACSYMPTOM NOT THE CAUSE SO REWINED ABOUT TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT GUT ACIDITY WAS QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN IT IS NOW IN THE SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL LITERATURE IN FACT FOR MANY YEARS LONG BEFORE I 'M GOING TO SAY IT HERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN PROPER ACIDITY OF THE GUT BUT THE SCIENCE AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONS SORT OF LOOKED AT THAT AS A KIND OF ASCANCE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE I DON'T I DO'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE HAT THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE THERE ARE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE THAT WERE PRESCRIBING ORISHIS A RECOMMENDING THAT PEOPLE TAKE HYDROCLORIC ACID H SEAL AND ADJUSTING GUT ACIDITY THAT WAY AND WAS KIND FROWNED UPON NOW IN LOOKING OVER THE PURE REVIEW LITERATURE IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS BUSINESS OF TRYING TO MAKE THE GUT A LITTLE MORE ACIDIC IS ACTUALLY ONE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE TREAT OR TRYING AMELIORATE ACID REFLUX SO IT'S KIN ACCOUNTER INTO ITIV INCREASING ACIDITY IN THE GUT TO TRY AND REDUCE ACID REFLUX THOUGH YOUR SPECITIC AN ACIDS WELL THE FEELD IS SHIFTED QUITE A BIT AND SO ORE GAN A REVIEW WHAT IT IS TO MAINTAIN THE CHEMISTRY OF THE GUT AT AM SLIGHTLY MORE ACIDIC LEVEL OR A MORE ACDIC LEVEL I SHOULD SAY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE IN GUT I JUST CALL IT WHAT IT IS IT'S GASTRIC JUICE SOUNDS GONTEGROS BUT GASTRIC JUICES ARE ACTUALLY POWERFUL MODULATORS OF BRAIN STATE PUT DIFFERENTLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO HAVE A HEALTHY BRAIN A WELTFUNCTIONING BRAIN AND A HEALTHY AND WEL FUNCTIONING BODY IS TO MAINTAIN PROPER GUT CHEMISTRY AND THAT'S BASICALLY ACCOMPLISHED BY GETTING THE RIGHT LEVEL OF ACIDITY AND ALKALINITY IN YOUR UT NOW THIS IS NOT QUACK SUDO SCIENCE THIS IS NOT BASED ON CLEANSES OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT ORIGAN TAC ABOUT NOW ARE PURE VIEW DATA IN VERY HICUALITY JOURNALS LIKE THE JOURNAL CELL WHICH IS ONE OF THE THREE APEXTOURNAL SCIENCE NATURE SELF AND JOURNALS OF THAT SORT THAT POINT TO THE GUT MICROBIOM AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO ACIDITY OF THE GUT AND HOW THE GUT MICROBIOM CAN HELP INHANCE AUTOOMUNE FUNCTION AND VARIOUS OTHER ASPECTS OF BRAIN ABODY HEALTH SO WITHIN ALL THE MU COSAL LINE TISSUES OF OUR BODY WE HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED MICROBIODA LITTLE MICRO ORGANISMS THAT WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT ACTUALLY COME FROM OUR ENVIRONMENT OR OUR FOOD AND LIVE INSIDE US AND THERE ARE GOOD MICROBIOTA AND THERE ARE BAD MICROBIOTA WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE GOOD MICROBIOTA OR BAD MICROBIOTA DEPENDS ON ONE THING AND THAT ONE THING IS HOW ACID OR ALKALINE THE GIVEN MUCOSAL TISSUE IS SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MICROBIOM IN OUR NOSE AND JUST AS A VERY BRIEF ACIDE BECAUS I'D BE REMISSIFIED IN SAY THIS IF YOU EMPHASIZED NASAL BREATHING MOST OF THE TIME EXCEPT WHEN SPEAKING OR EATING AND IF YOU DOWN PLAY MOUTH BREATHING MEANING YOU REFRAIN FROM MOUTH BREATHING ESPECIALLY IN SLEEP YOU IMPROVE THE NASAL MICROBIOM IT GETS BETTER AT FIGHTING OFF INFECTIONS THIS WERE SHOWN IN A BEAUTIFUL PAPER PUBLISH AND SELL REPORTS LAST YEAR AND THAT PAPER I SHOULD MENTION WAS PERFORMED IN HUMANS SO YOU GOT A MICROBIOM IN YOUR NOSE AND BY NASAL BREATHING MOST OF THE TIME NOT ALL THE TIME CAUSE HERE RE BETIMES WE NEED TO BREATH THROUGH YOUR MOUTH FOR WHATEVER REASON HARD EXERCISE OR OU KNON EATING YOR SPEAKING BUT BY BREATHING THRUGYOUR NOSE MOST OF THE TIME YOU ARE CREATING AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF IMMUNE DEFENCE AGAINST PARTICLES THAT COULD GET YOU SICK RAS WHEN YOU MOUTH BREATHE YOU ARE TAKING DOWN A LAYER OF DEFENCE AND YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF MORE AT RISK OF INFECTION THIS IS WHAT THIS PAPER SHOWS YOU ALSO HAVE A GUT MICROBIOM THAT IS IN YOUR THROAT IN YOUR STOMACH AND IN YOUR INTESTINS AND THAT GOT MICROBIOM IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL IN REGULATING YOUR MOOD AND YOUR IMMUNE FUNCTION NOW THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN SENSE DIRECTLY YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF GOOD MICROBIODA OR A BUNCH OF BAD MICROBIOTA BECAUSE YOU CAN FEEL THE MOVING AROUND IN THEIR ACTION THAT WOULD BE PRETTY AWFUL THAN PRETTY CREEPY FEELING RATHER THAT ACCORDING TO WHETHER NOT YOUR GUT IS ALKALINE OR ACITIC IN THE APPROPRIATE WAYS YOU WILL POPULATE YOUR GUT WITH THE APPROPRIATE MICROBIOTA SO YOU WANT YOUR STOMACH TO BE PRETTY ACITIC BUT OTHER ELEMENTS OF YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT ARE GOING TO BE MORE P H AND BASICALLY THERE'S A GRADIANT MEANING THERE IS A LOW TO HIGH P H GRADIANT ALONG THE GUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE P H SHOULD BE AT ANY ONE GIVEN POINT BECAUSE YOUARE NOCKAN I GO AND PUT MICROBIOT AT ONE LOCATION AND NOT ANOTHER WHAT YOU ESSENTIALLY WANT TO DO IS CREATEN ENENVIRONMENT WHERE THE PROPER MICROBIOTA CAN THRIVE BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU GREATLY DECREASE WHAT ARE CALLED INFLAMMATORY CIDO KINDS SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE SECRETED BOTH BY CELLS WITHIN THE BODY AND SELLS WITHIN THE BRAIN TO IMPACT BRAIN HEALTH AND BRAIN FUNCTION AND BODILY HEALTH THEY GO BY PARTICULAR NAMES SO THERE SOMETHING CALLED T AND F ALPA TUMER NECROSOS FACTOR ALFA IT IS INFLAMMATORIES NOT A GOOD THING TO HAVE AT ELEVATED LEVELS YOUAV SOMELY CALLED INTERLUCAN SIX ILL SIX ALSO CAUSES INFLAMMATION CAUSES DAMAGE TO TISSUES NOT A GOOD THING TO HAVE FOR HE ELEVATED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND THEN YOU HAVE ANTI INFLAMMATORY SIDEO KINDS THINGS LIKE INTERLUCANTEN WHICH REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THESE IF NOT THOUSANDS OF THESE DIFFERENT SIDA INDS SOME OF WHICH PROMOTE INFLAMMATION SOME OF WHICH REDUCE INFLAMMATION THE SIMPLE WAY TO ADJUST THESE THINGS IN THE PROPER RATIOS IS TO ADJUST YOUR GOT MICROBIUM THE BEST WAY TO JUST OR MICROBYUM IS TO INJEST CERTAIN TYPES OF FOODS SO THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL LITERATURE ON THIS NOW BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT LITERATURE IS THE ONE THAT I REFERRED TO AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EPISODE WHICH IS WHAT TO INJEST AND WHAT NOT TO INJEST IN TERMS OF FOODS IN ORDER TO CREATE THE BEST CONDITIONS IN YOUR GUT SO THAT YOU CAN CREATE THE BEST CONDITIONS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THERE WAS A STUDY DONE BY MYCOLLY JUST IN SONINBURG AT STANFORT SCHOOL OF MEDICINE JUST INS ACTUALY MY UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR AND THE BUILDING AT A STAMFORD WHERE I WORK AND THEY EXPLORED HOW DIFFERENT FOODS WERE DIFFERENT DIETS I SHOULD SAY IMPACT THE GOT MICROBIUM AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL STUDY BECAUSE IT WAS DONE IN HUNDREDS OF HUMAN PATIENTS THESE ACTUALLY WEREN'T PATIENTS THAT WERE SICK THAY HOU I SHOULD SAY HUMAN SUBJECTS THAT WERE OTHERWISE HEALTHY FROM A HUGE VRIETY OF BACKGROUNDS SO YET MEN YOU HAD WOMEN YOU HAD PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RACES DIFFERENT OF YET ETHNASIES YOU HAD A HUGE RANGER BACGROUNDS AND THEY TRACT ALL OF THAT AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY EXPLORED TWO TYPES OF DIETS ONE IS A HIGH FIBRE DIET SO DIETARY FIBRES ARE NON DIGESTIBLE ARE ONLY PARTIALLY DIGESTIBLE CARROHYDRATES TYPICALLY AND THEY COMPARED THAT TO DIETS THAT WERE UNCHANGED EXCEPT FOR THE INCLUSION OF A FEW TO A FEW MORE SERVINGS OF FERMENTED FOODS EACH DAY THINGS LIKE SOUERCROUT THINGS LIKE KIMCHI THEY EVEN EXPLORED SOUNDS BERY DISCUSTING ME BUT WHO KNOWS I'V NEVER TRIED IT WHICH IS FERMENTED COTTAGE CHEESE AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT AFTER INITIAL PERIOD OF A FEW WEEKS WHERE THEY HAD PEOPLE EITHER EAT A LOT OF FIBRE OR EAT ONE OR TWO SERVINGS OF FERMENTED FOODS THEY HAD THOSE PEOPLE RAMP UP THEIR INJESTION OF EITHER FIBR OR FERMENTED FOOD SO THAT CAN EASE THEM INTO IT SO WHEN BASE LINE THAN RAMP UP TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE INGJESTING YOU KNOW FOUR OR FIVE SERVING S OF FIBR OR OF FERMENTED FOODS PER DAY WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT FOR FERMENTED FOODS THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW FOUR OR FIVE TABLE SPOONS OF SOUR CRAUT OR KIMCHEE IT'S NOT QUITE IS NOT LIKE HUGE PLATEFULS OF A FERMENTED FOODS AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF THINGS THEY LOOK THAT THE PROTEOME WHICH IS A CONLICELEK IN THE GENO BUT A BUNCH OF PROTINES THAT ARE MADE IN THE BODY AND THEY DID THIS BY FEAGLE SAMPLES BY STOOL SAMPLES AND THEY DID THIS BY BLOOD DRAW WHICH IS GRATITS A REAL POWER OF THE STUDY IN FACT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE STUDY THAT I'M AWARE OF BY LOOKING AT THESE DIFFERENT TISSUES ACROSS LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO MANY MANY WEEKS AND THEN RETURNING PEOPLE TO THEIR TO THE DIE THAT THEY WERE ON BEFORE THEY WENT INTO THE STUDY THEY WERE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH IN A CAUSAL WAY HOW INGESTING FIBR OR FIBROUS FOODS VERSES INGESTING THESE FERMENTED FOODS ON A DAILY BASIS COULD IMPACT THE GUTMICROBYUM AND MANY MANY INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND MANY MANY MARKERS OF IMMUNE FUNCTION AND AUTOOMIAN FUNCTION AND THE TAKE AWAY MESSAGE FROM THIS STUDY IS THAT THE FERMENTED FOODS FAR OUT PERFORMED THE HYFIBR DIET IN FACT THE HYG FIBR DIET IN SOME PEOPLE WAS BENEFICIAL AND IN OTHER PEOPLE CAUSED ISSUES WITH INFLAMMATION THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I WAS TAUGHT GROWING UP IN WHAT MANY OF US WERE TAUGHT INTERESTINGLY THEY ALSO OBSERVE THAT PEOPLE THAT ATE THE HYGH FIBER DIET HAD INCREASES IN CERTAIN ENZIMES THAT LEND THEMSELVES TO BETTER DIGESTION OF CARBOHYDRATES AND I THINK THEREIS AN IMPORTANT INSIGHT TO COME FROM THIS NOWADAYS WE CONE TO LIVE IN THE AGE OF EXTREMES WHERE PEOPLE SEEM TO EITHER WANT TO BE CARNIVORE LIKE NEVER INGEST A VEGETABLE NOT I HEAR THEY ON E BEEN THEYRE LIKE ALLOWD PEPPER BUT THEY ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWD A YOU KNOW SOUR CROWD OR SOMETHING LIKE VERY EXTREME OR PURE PLANT BASE PURE VEGAN OR PURE SO ISENTIAA PURE CARBORAHYDRATE OR POR PURE ANIMAL PROTY VERY EXTREME AMONOMNIVOR I ALICE TO EAT A MIXTURE OF OF A DIFFERENT THINGS AT DIFFERENT TIMES TO DAYS BUT VERY EXTREME BUT THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT THIS WHAT THESE DATA SHOW IS THAT PERHAPS IN GESTING A HYH CARBOHYDRATE HY FIBER DIET WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THESE THE HYPHIBR CONDITION REALLY WAS ACTUALLY MAKES PEOPLE BETTER AT DIGESTING CARBOHYDRATES THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO A KIND OF A MORE PALIOTIBE OR OR CARNIVOR TYPE DIET MIGHT EAT CARBOHYDRATES AND SAY  THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME I DON'T FEEL GOOD IT MIGHT ALSO EXPLAIN WHY PEOPLE WHO PREDOMINANTLY EAT PLANTBASE FOODS AND CARBOHYDRATE FOODS WILL TRY EATING MEAT AS AN EXPERIMENT OR BECAUSE THEY LOST A BET OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THEY'LL DO OR DESPERATION AL THEY'LL DO THAT AND THEN THEY'LL SAY OH I DON'T FEEL GOOD WHEN I EAT MEAT HOW GOOD YOU FEEL IT SEEMS HOW WELL YOU CAN UTILIZE THAT FOOD AND HOW MUCH OF THAT FOOD YOU CRAVE MAY BE DETERMINED IN FACT IT APPEARS IS DETERMINED BY YOUR FOOD EATING HISTORY THE TYPES OF FOOD YOU EAT AND I THINK THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN SOME OF TH AT DIVIDE AND HOPEFULLY MIGHT BRIDGE SOME OF THE CASM BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE SAYING IT SHOULD BE ONE WAYOR SHOULD BE ANOTHER BUT AT THE CORE OF THE STUDY WAS THE BIGGER MESSAGE THE BIGGER MESSAGE IS THAT ALL OF US SHOULD BE INJESTING ON A REGULAR BASIS DAILY BASIS TWO TO FOUR SERVINGS OF FOR MENTED FOODS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE THE INFLAMMATORY MARKERS WENT DOWN THE MARKERS OF AUTOMUMUNE DISRUPTION WENT DOWN AND THE CHEMISTRY OF THE GUT THEREFORE WAS ADJUSTED IN THE APPROPRIATE WAYS NOW IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HIH FIBR IS BAD OR THAT FIBRA IS BAD I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO CONFUSE THIS BUT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT INTERRECEPTION ABOUT SENSING THE CELL THIS IS A SUBCONSCIOUS MECHANISM BY WHICH THE GUT COMMUNICATES TO MANY MANY ORGANS INCLUDING THE BRAIN AND IT'S BEEN SHOWN IN OTHER STUDIES ALSO IN QUALITY PU REIEW JOURNALS THAT WHEN THE CORRECT GUT MICROBIODA ARE PRESENT AND THESE INFLAMMATORY MARKERS ARE REDUCED COGNITION INPROVE SO ABILITY TO FOCUS ABILITY TO SLEEP ABILITY TO WARD OFF INFECTION AND WOUND HEALING ALL ENHANCED IN FACT EVEN IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER IN PEOPLE THAT STRUGGLE WITH VARIOUS MENTAL CONDITIONS OR DISORDERS OF THE MIND IMPROVING THE GOT MICROBIUM SEEMS TO HAVE POWERFUL EFFECTS ON IMPROVING BRAIN SYMPTOMS ALONG THE LINES OF AUTO IMMUNITY THERE ARE NUMBER OF CONDITIONS THAT WE CALL AUTOOMUNE CONDITIONS AND WE WILL DO ENTIRE EPISODES ABOUT THESE GOING FORWARD BUT FOR PEOPLE WITH SO CALLED IRIRRITABLE BOWEL CYNDRUM FOR PEOPLE WITH CRONES DISEASE FOR PEOPLE WITH LEEKY GUT HASCHIMOTOS WHICH IS A COUND OF A IMMUNE SYSTEM SELF ATTACK ON ONE'S THIROID GLAND AND THINGS LIKE EGIMA SKIN CONDITIONS ADJUSTING THE GOT MICROBUM HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL IN POSITIVELY ADJUSTING THE SYMPTOMS OF ALL OF THOSE WILL IT FIX THOSE CONDITIONS ENTIRELY PROBABLY NOT BUT CAN IT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THEM PROBABLY YES THERE IS ONE THING THAT'S WORTH MENTIONING IN THAT LIST WHICH IS LEEKY GUT WHAT IS LEEKY GUT HERE ORTI M AT THE GUTS WHAT IS IT TO HAVE A LEEKY GUT SOUNDS AWFUL AND SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING SOR LIKE LEAKING OUT THE THE END OF THE TWOBE AN IT MAYBE THAT TOO I DON'T KNOW BUT LEEKY GUT IS ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOUR GUT IS NOT A TWOBE THAT'S CONTINUOUS ONE CELL ITS ACTALLY MADE UP OF MANY MANY CELLS IN THOSE CELLS FORM A BARRIER AND THEY FORM WHAT ARE CALLED TIGHT JUNCTIONS IF YOU HAVE TWO CELLS YOU AN CREATE O FENSE OUT OF THOSE CELLS YOU BIND THEM TOGETHER THE WAY THAT THE BODY DOES THIS IS TO BIND THEM TOGETHER WITH WHAT ARE CALL TIGHT JUNCTIONE THESE ARE THEY GO BY NAMES LIKE CLOUDINS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IF YOU WONT T LOOK THEM UP THESE TIGHT JUNCTIONS FORM A NICE BARRIER LIKE A CYCLONE FENCE THAT THINGS CAN'T GET PASSED BUT LIKE A CYCLONE FENCE ONLY MOLECULES OF A CERTAIN SIZE CAN GO THROUGH THOSE WHOLES SO YOU NOT CANOT PASS A SOCRBALL THROUGH AND INTACT CYCLONE FENCE BUT YOU COULD PASS FOR INSTANCE AA FEATHER THROUGH THAT FENCE S O LEEKI GUT IS WHEN THE CONDITIONS IN THE GUT ARE TWO ALKALINE OR THE GUT MICROBIODA ARE OFF IN THE GUT MEANING MICROBIODA THAT LIKE ALCKALINE GUTS ARE LIVING THERE AND THOSE TIGHT JUNCTIONS CANT FUNCTION AT THAT PARTICULAR P H AND YOU CREATE LITTLE HOLES IN THAT FENTE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU INGEST FOODS SOME OF THOSE FOODS LITERALLY LEAK OUT OF THE GUT AND INTO THE EXTRACELLAR SPACE AND INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND BECAUSE FOODS INCLUDE PROTINES AND ANTIABODIES REACT TO PROTINES WHAT ENDS OF HAPPENING IN LEEKI GUT AND THE REASON WE TALK ABOUT IT AUTOMUNE CONDITIONS IS THAT YOU START DEVELOPING ANTIBODIES TO PARTICULAR FOOD PROTINES AND THEN PEOPLE START FEELING THAT THEY HAVE FOODOLOGIES AND THEY DO THEY ACTUALLY CREATE PARTICULAR FOODOLAGIES NOW ONE WAY TO PREVENT LEEKI GUT IS TO GET THE REST OF THE GUT SITUATION HAPPY BY IN JESTING THE PROPER FOODS THAT WE TALK ABOUT BEFORE IN GESTSING FERMENTED FOODS ON A REGULAR BASIS THE OTHER IS ARE OLD FRIEND GLUDOMINE AGAIN THERE ARE SOME DATA AND I SHOULD SAY IT'S A LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES SHOWING THAT IN GESTING GLUDOMINE ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE TATE THAT CUSE ME TEASPOONS PERDAY CAN HELP ALLEVIATE LEKY GUT NOW THE MECHANISM FOR THAT STILL ISN'T CLEAR WHETHER NOT SUGGESTING P H OR WHETHER NOTS CREATING MORE FAVORABLE IN A I ENVIRONMENT FOR THE MICROBIODA BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH GLUDOMINE CAN IN SOME PEOPLE ENHANTS RASHES THA IMPROVE CONDITIONS OF LEEKY GUT SO THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL AS WELL AND THEN THE FINAL THING ABOUT TIS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AS RETALK ABOUT CHEMICAL SENSING IN THE GUT AND HOW THAT INPACTS WELL BEING IS ABOUT GUT ACIDITY AND THIS I CONFESS IS A LITTLE BUT CONTROVERSIAL SOME PEOPLE ARE ON BOARD THIS OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT AND SO I' LOVE YOUR FEED BACK ON THIS AT O IF YOU AGREE PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU DISAGREE PLEASE TELL ME BUT PLEASE TELL ME WHY YOU DISAGREE IN PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE OR DATA ALTHOUGH IT'S ALWAYS BETTER IF YOU CAN POINT ME TOWARDS PUREVIEWED STUDIES THERE IS A PRACTICE THAT SOME PEOPLE EMBRACE A'M NOT RECOMMENDING PEOPLE NECESSARILY DO THIS AND YOU  DEFINITELY WANT O TACT YOUR DOCTOR BUT WHERE PEOPLE HAVE FOODOLAGIES OR THEIR HAVING MOOD OR AUTOMUMUNISSUES AND THEY TREAT THIS SOME PEOPLE RECOMMEND TREATING THIS THROUGH THE INGESTION OF A SEL HYDROCLORIC ACID TABLETS NOW HYDROCLORIC ACID CAN BURN YOU RIGHT ACIDS CAN BURN YOU THEY LITERALLY CAN MELT AWAY SKIN YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH ACIDS OF ALL KINDS TRULY BUT HYDROCLORIC ACID IS SOLD AS IN SUPPLEMENT FORM IN CAPSILOR PILL FORM AND THERE IS A PRACTICE OF STARTING TO INGEST ONE OR TWO HYDROCLORIC ACID TABLETS MIDWAY THROUGH A MEAL AND THEND WHAT PEOPLE WILL GENERALLY DO IS EXAMINE TO SEE WHETHER NOT THAT IMPROVES THEIR SYMPTOMS OF INDIGESTION HOW IT RELATES TO MOOD HOW IT RELATES TO WELL BEING HOW IT RELATES TO THEIR SENSATION OF THEIR GOT VICERA BY CHANGING THE ACIDITY YOU ALSO CHANGE THE WAY THAT THE GUT COMMUNICATES WITH THE BRAIN THROUG THE MECHANISMS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND THERE ARE A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMBRACING THESE PRACTICES OF TAKING H S EL IT'S OFTEN COMBINED WITH OTHER THINGS IT'S USUALLY A COCOMBINED WITH IT WITH AN ENZIN A AND THAT ENSIN IS PEPSIN SO MOST OF THESE SUPPLEMENTS COME IN THE FORM BATIN H EL PEPSIN AND WHILE THEY ARE NOT A CURAL AS CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IT SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE CUREALE MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE A HARD TIME ADJUSTING THE PH OF THEIR GUT AND HAVE A HARD TIME ADJUSTING THE MICROBIOTA OF THEI'R GOT IN THE APPROPRIATE WAYS HAVE BENEFITED FROM TAKING THESE BATINE H SEL PEPSIN TABLETS OR CAPSILS JURING MEALS AND THE GENERAL INSTRUCTION IS TO START SLOW TO START WITH ONE OR TWO AND THEN TO FIND A LEVEL THAT YOUR COMFORTABLE WITH THAT DOESN'T CREATE AN ACCESSIVE FEELING OF WARMTH IN THE IN THE STOMACH THAT DOESN'T THROW OFF YOUR DIGESTION SO TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERMENTATION AGAIN DEFILY TALK TO YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER A BEFORE EXPLORING THIS BUT THIS HAS BECOME A VERY COMMON PRACTICE FOR PEOPLE WITH AUTOOMUN DISORDERS AND ACCESSING THE GOT BECAUS IT IS ACCESSIBLE BY TAKING THINGS HAS ALSO BECOME WHEN WHICH PEOPLE WITH VARIOUS MENTAL CONDITIONS ARE TRYING TO ADJUST THEIR MOOD AND ADJUSTS THEIR WELL BEING ALON THESE LINES I I DO WANT A MENSION THAT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT PEOPLE THAT SUPPLEMENT WITH A LOT OF A PROBIOTICS OR EVEN PREBIOTICS CAN SOMETIMES EXPERIENCE BRAINFAG THIS ISN'T DISCUSSED A LOT AND THE DAT ARE A LITTLALL OVER THE PLACE BUT IT IS THE WEREH THINKING ABOUT THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO CREATE AS MANY MICROBIOTA IS POSSIBLE WHAT YOU WANT IS MICROBIOTA DIVERSITY AND I SHOULD MENTION THIS AGAIN IN REFERENCE TO THE SONUNBURG STUDY WHICH WAUS WHAT THE HIH FIBR DIET DOES IS IT INCREASES CERTAIN MICROBIOTA BUT IT LIMITS THEIR DIVERSITY AND WHAT THE FERMENTED FOOD DIET DOES OR I SHOULD SAY THE DIET THAT INCLUDES REGULAR INGESTION OF FERMENTED FOODS A FEW SERVING TO DAY IS IT INCREASES MICROBIOTA DIVERSITY NOW LACK OF MICROBIRA DEDIVERSITY HAS A NAME IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IT'S CALLED DISPIOSIS AND DISPIOSIS IS BAD DISPIOSIS IS WHAT YOU SEE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SPENDING LONG PERIODS OF TIME ON BED EREST OR WHEN THEY'VE BEEN CHRONICALLY ILL AND SO HERE AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE GOT EITHER BY ADJUSTING CIDITY MAYBE YOU EXPLORE THET BATINE H S EL PEPSIN THING I THINK IF YOU HAVE HEALTHY GIGESTION IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A A GOOD A RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR GOT AND IT HAS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP TO YOU SORT OF A SILLY PHRASE BECAUSE IT IS YOU AND YOU ARE IT AM THEN I DON'T THING IS ANY MEAN A ANY NEED TO APURSUE THIS BUT IF YOU DON'T THAT MIGHT BE ONE AVENUE TO PURSUE HOWEVER I THINK PRIMARY IN ALL OF THIS IS THE FERMENTED FOOD FINDING S AND ITS NOT JUST ONE STUDY ITS MANY MANY FINDINGS THAT NOW BRING US TO A PLACE WHERE A HUGE CENTERE OF MASS OF DATARE APOINTING US IN THE DIRECTION OS SAYING IN JEST FERMENTED FOODS ON A REGULAR BASIS I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT CONDITIONS LIKE SARCOPENIA WHICH IS THE LOSS OF MUSCLE TISSUE AS WE AGE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE OFFSET BI IMPROVING THE GUT MICROBIODA SO WHILE TO DAY IS ABOUT IN TERRECEPTION WERE TALKING ABOUT SENSING WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT SUBCONSCIOUS SENSING WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT SUBCONSCIOUS SENSING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUBCONSCIOUS SENSING OF THE MILEU OF THE BODY WHEN THE MILEU OF THE GUT IN THE BODY IS RIGHT THEN THE BRAIN AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION VERY WELL AND SO THIS IS IN SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN SIT BACK AND SAY OH YOU KNOW I I FEEL ALL THOSE GOOD MICHROBIODA IN MY GUT OR OH NO THOSE ARE BAD MICROBIOTA YOU CAN'T DO THAT UNLESSYOU'REGOING TO TAKE FEGALE SAMPLES AND AM AND BLOOD SAMPLES AND ANALYZE THEM IN THE WITH THE EXTREN A EXHOSTIVE NATURE THAT THAT THE SONIMBERG AND OTHER LAPS DO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT KIND OF INFORMATION I KNOW THEIR COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT DO THIS AND I I DON'T WANT TO KNOCK ON ANY OF THEM AM BUT I DO WANT EMPHASIZE THAT TO DO THIS RIGHT TO REALLY ANALYZE WHICH SIDE O CINS YOU'RE MAKING WHICH ONES YOU'RE NOT YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT A HUGE NUMBER OF THEM AND THAT REQUIRES LARGE SCALE PRODEOMIC AND GOUNOMAC AND A INFLAMMATORY MARKER SCREENS IS JUST NOT THE KIND OF THING THAT MOST COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES CAN REALLY PROVIDE TO PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN INTERPRET RATHER THIS IS A CASE WHERE YOU CAN SIMPLY GO TO THE EFFECTOR TO THE THING THAT CAN ACTUALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR YOU IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT'S FERMENTED FOODS AND THAT'S KEEPING THE STOMACH SLIGHTLY MORE ACID THAN ONE MIGHT THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO SO LET'S TALK ABOUT BARFING FIRST BARFING AK VOMITING IS WHEND THE CONTENTS OF YOUR GUTS RUN IN REVERSE MEANING WHEN THEY GO UP FROM YOUR STOMACH SOMETIMES EVEN UP FROM THE INTESTINS EVEN THOUGH THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS UP OUT THE EST OFFIGIS IN MOUTH AND ON TO WHATEVER SURFACE HAPPENS TO BE IN FRONT OF YOU STA TERRIBLE THING NOBODY LIKES TO DO IT BUT IT'S A VERY INTERESTING ASPECTOUR BIOLOGY BECAUSE IT REVEALS A BEAUTIFUL AND ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR CHEMISTRY ND OUR BRAIN SO YOUR BRAIN IS ACTUALLY LOCKED BEHIND A GAIT AND THAT GAIT IS NOT YOUR SKULL THAT GAIT IS THE SO CALLED BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER SO JUST LIKE YOUR GUT HAS THESE EPITHELIAL TIGHT JUNCTIONS THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THAT PROVIDE O FENCE SO THINGS CAN'T GET THROUGH AND GET THROUGH AN LEKY GUT YOUR BRAIN HAS TIGHT JUNCTIONS THAT ARE VERY VERY TIGHT IT'S ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL THAT ONLY CERTAIN MOLECULES GET ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AND THAT OTHERS DON'T AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT MOST ALL NINETY NINE POINT NINE NINE NINE NINE PER SENT OF YOUR NURONS DO NOT REGENERATE I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE READ SPECIALY IN THE NEWS RECENTLY ABOUT HOUSELICADLICS CAUSE NEROGENESIS BECAUSE THEY DON'T S ABSOLUTELY WRONG PSYCHODELICS HAVE EFFECTS ON BRAIN PLACISY BUT THEAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH NORGENISIS AT LEAST NO DAY OS SUPPORT IT BUT BECAUSE YOU CANT T MAKE NEW NURONS YOU ALSO CAN'T DAMAGE THE ONES YOU'VE GOT ER YOU SHOULDN'T AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER OR A B B B SO THE B B B AS IT'S CALLED PREVENTE SUBSTANCES FROM GETTING TO THE BRAIN HOWEVER LIKE ANY FENTE IT IS NOT ALWAYS UNIFORM ALONG ITS LENGTH AND THERE ARE LITTLE SPOTS WITHIN THAT FENCE WHERE CHEMICALS CAN SNEAK ACROSS TO THE BRAIN AND THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL DESIGN ONO ANYTHING BOUT THESIGNS ALWAYS SAY WASN'NT CONSULT EF THE DESIGN FACE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND OF INTELLIGENT DESIGN OR ANYTHING THAT IS NOT THE DOPIC OF THIS BODCAST IS NOT A PHILOSOPHY PODCAST NOR IS IT A RELIGION PODCAST ATS THE SCIENCE PODCAST BUT THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL DESIGN OF SOME SORT THERE ARE LITTLEHOLES IN THAT FENCE AND THERE LITTLE NURONS THAT SIT RIGHT BEHIND THOSE HOLES AND THOSE NURONS SENSE WHAT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE BLOOD IS SO I'M GUESSING YOU PROBABLY DIDNT IMAGINE THAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION ABOUT SENSING THE SELF WOULD BE SENSING YOUR OWN BLOOD BUT YOU DO THERE IS A LITTLE ARY OF YOUR BRAIN THAT'S LITTLE INDEED BUT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT CALLED AREA POSTREMA P O S T R  M A AND AREA POSTREMA IS AN AREA THE BRAINSTEM THAT SIT'S RIGHT NEXT TO ANOTHER BRAIN AREA CALLED THE KEMO RECEPTOR TRIGGER ZONE AND WHEN THE CONTENTE IN YOUR BLOOD STRIM ARE OF A PARTICULAR KIND MEANING WHEN THERE ARE PATHAGINS OR IT'S TWO ACITIC THE NURONS IN AREA POSTREMA AND THE NURONS IN THE KE MUST RECEPTOR TRITRIGGERZON THE C T Z AS ITS CALLED TRIGGER A BUNCH OF MOTOR REFLECES IN THE ABDOMINAL WALL THAT MAKE YOU ALL BARF OK THE CONTHE FEELING THAT YOU NEED TO THROW UP IS TRIGGERED BY THESE NURONS IN THE BRAINSTEM AND THOSE NURAS IN THE BRAINSTEM ARE TRIGGERED BY THE PRESENCE OF CERTAIN CHEMICALS AND THE REASON WHY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AT THAT LOCATION IS BECAUSE POSTRMA HAS TO BE THERE LIKE A CROSSING GUARD MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING THROUGH THE BLOOD IS O K AND IF IT EVEN SENSE IS JUST THE TINIEST BIT THAT THINGS ARE OFF IT'S CAN A TRIGGER THAT REFLECTS NOW THE REALLY INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE NURONS IN AREA POSTREMA RESPOND TO THE CHEMISTRY OF THE BLOOD BUT THEY ALSO WILL RESPOND TO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TO THINGS THAT WE THINK AND THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE AND EVEN PARTICULAR MEMORIES THIS IS WY WHEN CERTAIN PEOPLE SEE VOMIT OR SEE SOMEONE ELSE VOMIT OR EVEN SOMEBODY ELSE HEAVING AS IF THEY ARE GOING TO VOMIT THEY THEMSELVES FEEL AS IF THEY ARE GOING TO VOMIT I'M GUESSING THEY'RE PROBABLY VEN A FEW OF YOU RIGHT NOW THAT FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT VOMIT Y U MIGHT FEEL SALIVAT SALIVATION IN YOUR THROAT WHICH IS ALWAYS A PRECURSE OR DIVOMITING SOME PEOPLE THEM MEMORY OF OR THE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING LIKE BLOOD OR VOMIT OR USE YOUR IMAGINATION CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER THE VOMIT REFLEC AND THAT'S BECAUSE THESE NURANS AN AREA POSTREMA AR VERY SENSITIVE TO PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF INTERACTIONS WITH NEGATIVE THINGS SO AN ACCIASM SAYING THIS I FEEL MY GUT KIND OT CRAMPING UP AGAIN I'M I I DON'T VOMIT VERY EASILY ON NOT ONE OF THOSE OF NOR AM I SOMEBODY WHOSE NEVER VOMITAN U AND HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MY VOMIT HISTORY BUT I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE IN THIS AIN THIS CONTEXT THE NURANS OVE AREA POSTREMA OR THERE BASICALLY TO KEEP YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM SAFE AND THINK GOODNESS THEY ARE BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY THEY THEY DRINK SO MUCH ALCOHOL THAT THEY THROW UP HAVE YOUEVER WONDERED WHY THAT IS WELL IT'S BECAUSE ALCOHOL FUNDAMENTALLY IS A POISON I'M NOT SAYING FOR YOU KNOW AGE APPROPRIATE FOLKS THAT INJESTING ALCHOL IS BAD UM THAT THIS ISNAN A JUDGMENT CALL BUT ALCOHOL ITSELF AT EXCESSIVE LEVELS IN THE BLOOD STREAM TRIGGERS POSTREMA TO CAUSE VOMITING SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHEREBY MEMORIES CONTEXT BUT ALSO JUST THE CHEMISTRY OF OUR INTERNAL STATE IS TRIGGERING BEHAVIORS THAT ARE VERY HARD WIRE THEIR VERY REFLECT STRIVEN AND WHY WOULD IT BE THAT SOME PEOPLE GET MORE NAUXIOUS THAN OTHERS THAT AE GIVEN LEVEL WELL HEOUGH TO DO WITH ALCOL TOLERANCE SOME PEOPLE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A YOU KNOW WE REFER TO IS A STRONGER STOMACH OR A STOMACH OF STEEL OTHER PEOPLE THEY THROW OUT VERY EASILY IF THEY DON'T IT FEEL WELL OR IF THEY INJEST ANYTHING THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF FROM A PURELY ADAPTIVE STANDPOINT IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO VOMIT UP THINGS THAT AREN'T GOOD FOR YOU RATHER THAN TO PASS THROUGH HAVE THEM PASS THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM ESPECIALLY IF THOSE THINGS ARE CONTAINED IN LIPITS FOR INSTANCE IF YOU INJEST SOMETHING THAT'S IN LIPID FORM BECAUSE SELLS LITERALLY EVERY SEL IN YOUR BODY IS SURROUNDED BY LITTLE THIN LAYER OF FATTY TISSUE  WE CALL THIT THE BY THEYR MEMBRANE IT'S A LITTLE MEMBRING FAT CAN MOVE THROUGH FAT VERY EASILY AND SO ANY BAD STUFF YOU INJEST CAN GET STUCK IN YOUR SYSTEM SO LET'S TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT HOW TO REDUCED NAUSIA BECAUSE NAUSIA IT THAT SALIVATION THAT FEELING THAT YOU CAN OVOMIT CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL AN AN AIN AN ADAPTIVE CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE YOU INJESTED SOMETHING BAD BUT SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE NAUSIA FOR OTHER REASONS THERE ARE GOOD WAYS TO REGULATE NAUSIA AND THE WAYS THEY REGULATE NAUGARE VERY INTERESTING THEY ACTUALLY ADJUST THE ACTIVITY OF THESE NAURANS IN AREA POSTREMA OR THEY CHANGE THE CHEMISTRY OF THE BLOOD DIRECTLY AND MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE PERHAPS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE GOOD DATA A LEVEN RESEARCH STUDIES WHERE THE ONES THAT I COULD FIND PUREVIEWED RESEART STUDIES WITH NO BY ITS SO INDEPENDENT STUDIES SHOWING THAT GINGER CAN CAUSE A NOTABLE REDUCT ION IN NAUSIA HOW MUCH GINGER ONE TO THREE GRAMS WHAT'S ONE TO THREE GRAMS WILL HEVT TO MEASURE IT OUT ON A SCALEENLESS YOU'RE TAKING IT IN PILLOR CAPSIL FORMA DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER IF YOU TAKE IT IN PILL OR CAPSIL FORM SO THIS A THING THAT YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE THAT GINGER CAN REDUCE NAUSIA INDEED IS TRUE PEPPERAMENT APPARENTLY CAN ALSO DO THAT AND SOME OF YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT CANIBUS CIN REDUCE NAUSIA NOT SURPRISED BECAUSE CANIBAS WHICH HAS DIFFERENT LEGALITY IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SO PLEASE TAKE THAN TO CONSIDERATION BUT CANABAS T H C AND OR IT TURNS OUT C B D CAN REDUCE NAUSIA THAT'S BEEN SHOWN IN AT LEAST ONE STUDY AND IT PROBABLY DOES THAT NOT BY CHANGING THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR BLOOD BUT BY CHANGING THE THRESHOLD FOR FIRING OF THESE NURONS IN AREA POSTREMA AND THERE ARE CONDITIONS SUCH AS IN KEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPE AN OTHERS WHERE PEOPLE ARE FEELING VERY NAUSIOUS I'M NOT RECOMMENDING PEOPLE PLE USE CANIBUS UNLESS A THEY'VE DECIDED WITH THEIR SELVES AND THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR DOCTR THAT THEY SHOULD BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THO THING ABOUT C B D AND WELL DO A WHOLE EPISODE ON T H C AN C B D C B D DOESN'T HAVE OR ISN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE THESE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES THAT T H C DOES ALTHOUGH SEBD CAN HAVE A MILD A TO MAJOR ANCILIATIC ANXIETY REDUCING EFFECT BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE DATA ARE WUT A THE DADA SUPPORT I SHOULD SAY A THE ANECDOTAL A REPORTS WHICH ARE THAT CANABUS CAN REDUCE A NAUSIA SO TO BARFLESS GINGER PEPPERAMENT AND IF APPROPRIATE AND LEGAL FOR YOU POSSIBLY CANIBAS NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT FEVER IN PREVIOUS EPISODES AND IN FUTURE EPISODES WE DEAL WITH THERMAL REGULATION WHICH IS THE BODIES ABILITY TO REGULATE ITS TEMPERATURE TALK ABOUT COLD AND HE ANSANAS AND ICE BATHS AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE WE'RE NOT CIN TO DEAL WITH ALL THAT RIGHT NOW BUT I PROMISE WE WILL GOING FORWARD TO DAY I ONLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT FEVER BECAUSE FEVER DIRECTLY RELATES TO INTERROCEPTION WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL A FEVER IS SIMPLY AN INCREASE IN BODY TEMPERATURE THAT INCREASE IN BODY TEMPERTURE IS TRIGGERED BY NURONS IN THE BRAIN AND THOSE NURONS IN THE BRAIN ARE TRIGGERED BY THE PRESENCE OF PARTICULAR THINGS IN THE BLOODSTREM WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WELL TOXENS BACTERIA VIRUSES WHEN SOMETHING BAD GETS IN OUR SYSTEM THE BODY DOESN'T KNOW ITS BAD IT JUST KNOWS ITS FOREIGN AND IT HASN'T SEEN IT BEFORE OR THAT IT'S IN THE WRONG COMPARTMENT OF THE BODY SO EARLY ARE WE ARE TING ABOUT PROCHINGS THAT LEAK OUT OF THE GUT AND GET ELSEWHERE YOU NOW YOU DON'T WANT A PIECE OF STAKE SITTING IN YOUR BICEPT THATWILL BE BAD YOU WOULD ACTUALLY DEVELOP ANABODIES YOU WOULD HAVE A HORRIBLE INFECTION BUT YOUR BODY HAS THIS INTELLIGENCE AND THAT INTELLIGENCE IS TO KNOW MTHESE PROACHINGS ARE NORMALLY NOT SEEN IN THIS REGION AND THEN YOUR BODY OR THE SELLS THERE I SHOULD SAY WILL RELEASE SOMETHING THAT THEN WILL TRABEL TO THE BRAIN AND WILL TRIGGER AN INCREASE IN BODY TO EMPERATURE SO THAT YOUR BODY COOKS THE BAD THING OR THE CAUSE OF THE BAD THING IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL ADAPTEVE MECHANISM WE ALWAYS THINK FEVER IS SO TERRIBLE BUT FEVER IS THERE TO COOK THE BAD THING THAT'S INSIDE YOU OR THAT HAS LEFT THE CORRECT COMPARTMENT INSIDE YOU AND IS IN THE WRONG COMPARTMENT INSIDE YOU SO WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THE FEVER MECHANISM IS THAT IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE BARFING MECHANISM BASICALLY YOU HAVE A SET OF NURONS THAT SIT NEAR THE VENTRICLS MEMBER THE VENTRICALS IS WHOLE IN THE TUBE THAT IS YOU THE TUBE THAT IS YOU YOU ARE A TUBE A SERIES OF TUBES AND YOUR BRAIN HAS A HOLE DOWN THE MIDDL AND IT EXTENDS DOWN TO TE BOTTOM OF YOUR SPINAL CORD AT THE FRONT IT'S CALLED THE VENTRICALS THEY START WITH WHAT ARE ALLD THE LATTERAL VENTRICALS AND THE EXCUSE ME STARTS WITH THE THIRD IN THE LATERAL VENTRICALS AND THEN IT GOES TO THE FOURTH VENTRICL AND THEN TO WHAT'S CALLD THE CENTRAL CANAL BUT BASE IS JUST A BIG SPACE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THE MIDDLE OF YOUR BRAIN AND YOU HAVE ONE VENTRICAL THAT ALRAY MENTION CALLE THE THIRD VENTRICAL AND IT SHAPED GOT ARE LIKE A THIN OVAL UP UPRIGHT IF YOUR LISTENING TO THIS JUST THINK AN EY JUST SHING THE SHAPE OF AN EYE BUT IT'S GON A ROTATED A NINETY DEGREES SO IT'S UP AND DOWN IS OPPOSED TO ACROSS AND A LONG THAT THIRD VENTRICAL THERE'S THERE ARE LITTLE NURONS THAT CANSENSE WHAT'S IN THE CEREBRASPINAL FLUID THAT FILLS THE VENTRICAL SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE NURONS THAT ARE SENSING THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR CEREBRALSPINAL FLUID AND THAT HAVE ACCESS THEREFOR TO THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR BODY BECAUSE THAT CEREBROSPINAL FLUID IS GOING UP AND DOWN THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD BUT INTO THAT CEREBROSPINAL FLUID ARE SIGNALS ABOUT THE VARIOUS CHEMICALS WITHIN THE BODY SO THIS IS NOT A MECHANICAL SYSTEM THIS IS A CHEMICAL SYSTEM REMEMBER WHICH I AM OUT MECHANICAL INFORMATION AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION ACCESSING THE BRAIN SO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING BAD IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU'VE INJESTED A VIT YOU BREATHED IN AVIRIS OR YOU INHALED SOME BACTERIA OR YOU GOT A CUT ON YOUR LEG AND SOME BACTERIAR GROWING THERE OF COURSE LOCALLY THERE WILL BE EFFECTS LITTLE THINGS CALLED THE MAST SELL THE AN A ST LITTLE PACKETS OF HISTOMINE LITERALLY WILL GO THERE AND EXPLODE PAND CAUSE INFLAMMATION WHICH IS ACTULY A GOOD INFLAMMATION AND WILL RELEASE LITTLE THNGS FOL MACRIPHAGES TRARE TO GOBBLE UP THE INFECTION THE OTHER DAY WAS IN TEXAS THAT IS A MEANAL MOSQUITOS IN TEXAS AND A LOT OF THEM AND I WOULD STAND OUTSIDE AND I'D GET BET AND I'TD IDND FEEL A THING BUT THEN LATER THAT NIGHT THEY STARTED SWELLING UP IN ITCHING AND THE NI'T ITCH THEM AND THEN THEY'D SWELL EVEN MORE THAT WAS BECAUSE THE RELEASE OF MAST CELLS OF HISTOMINES INSIDE THOSE MASS CELLS THAT WOULD LITERALLY CAUSING INFLAMMATION OF THE TISSUE IT WASN'T THE POISON FROM THE MOSQUITO ITSELF T WAS THE IMMUNERESPONSE TO THOSE WELL YOU ALSO HAVE THIS SYSTEMIC OR BODY WIDE ATTEMPT TO KILL STUFF AND THAT'S THE FEVER SO THE NURONS THAT LYING THESE VENTRICALS WITH CREBRASPINAL FLUID GO BY A PARTICULAR NAME THEY ARE CALLED CIRCUM VENTRICULAR ORGANS MEANING NEAR S RKUM VENTRICULAR NEAR THE VENTRICLS AND YOU HAVE THESE ORGANS AND THERE IS SET OF NURONS HAS A REALLY COOL NAME CALLE THE OVIALTY I ON'TKNO I LIKE THAT WBAT LEGISLY GETI'S THE ORGANUM VASCULOSUM OF THE LATERAL TERMINALIS ORGANUM BASCULOSUM LATINL TERMINALISE OVIEL TEA ARE THE NURONS THAT RESPON TO TOXINS AND BAD STUFF IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM HOWEVER MINOR MAGER AN THEY RELEASE THINGS LIKE IOL KAY ONE WHICH ARE IN FLAMMATORY SIDT OF KINDS IN FLAMMATORY IN THIS CASE IS GOOD YOU WANT INFLAMMATION AT THE SIGHT OF AN INFECTION 'S A GOOD THING IT'S CON A HELP WITH HEALING AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE CONDITIONS IN YOUR BODY WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN IS WHEN THOSE OVIAL TENURONS AR ACTIVATED BECAUE YOU HAVE SOMETHING BAD IN YOUR BODY OR SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING IN YOUR BODY THEY COMMUNICATE WITH AN AREA OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE PREOPTIC ARYA OF YOUR HYPOTHALMUS AND THE PREOPTIC AREA CRANKS UP YOUR TEMPERATURE AND TRIES TO COOK THAT BAD THING NOW IT'S WORTH TALKING ABOUT FEVER FOR A MOMENT AND TALKING ABOUT THERMAL REGULATION BECAUSE I THINK HIS ACTUALLY COULD SAVE SOME LOVES SO IF YOU ARE OVER HEATED TO A POINT WHERE YOU KNOW YOU GETTING UP PAST A HUNTER AND TWO OR HUNTER AND THREE IT'S CAN A VERY DEPENDING ON PERSON AF PERSON CERTAINLY AGE YOU KNOW KIDS SOME PEOPLE THINK CAN TOLERATE HIGHER LEVELS OF FEVER THAN ADULTS BUT LOOK YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT HEATING UP THE BRAIN TOO MUCH BECAUSE ONCE THOSE NURONS ARE GONE THEY DO NOT COME BACK AND NURONS DO NOT DO WELL AND VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES ONCE YOURE BODY TEMPERATURE STARTS GETTING UP TO HUNDERIN TOO HUNDER AND THREE CERTAINLY HUNDER AND FOR YOU ARE STRING TO ENTER SERIOUS DANGERSZON THIS CAN HAPPEN THROUGH EXERCISE IN HOT ENVIRONMENTS OR AN INABILITY TO ESCAPE HEAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE COVERING OR ADEQUATE ON TVENTILATION OR COOLING IT CAN ALSO BE BECAUSE OF EXCESS IV FEVER FOR WHATEVER REASON A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO PUT A COOL COMPRESS ON THE BACK OF THE NECK OR TO COOL THE TORSO IN  DISCUSSING THIS WITH MY COLLIGUE CRAG HELLER WHOSE AT STAMPORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND HE'S ON THE UNDERGRADUATE SIDE OF THE CAMPUS AS WELL RUNS A BIOLOGY LABEYES TAE WORLD EXPERT AND THERMAL REGULATION IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S THE WRONG RESPONSE TO TRY AND COOL OFF THE BODY IF YOU PUT A COLD TOWEL OR YOU PUT AND AN ICE PACK ON THE BACK OF THE NECK WHAT YOU EFFECTIVELY DO IS COOL THE BLOOD THAT'S GOING TO THE BRAIN AND IF YOU DO THAT THEN YOUR BRAIN WILL REACT BY TURNING UP THE CRANK IN SO TO SPEAK ON THE NURONS IN THE PREOPTIC AREA AND WILL HEAT YOU UP FURTHER AND CAN COOK YOUR BRAIN AND ORGANS FURTHER SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE YOU WANT TO COOL THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEAT THE PALMS OF THE HANDS AND THE UPPER PART OF THE FACE I'M NOT GON TO GOING TO ALL THE DETAILS AS TO WHY YOU WANT TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW BUT THOSE OF THE LOCATIONS YOU WANT TO COOL NOW YOU CAN ALSO COOL THE REST OF THE BODY BUT IT'S NOT O A TO JUST STAY UNDER THE COVERS AND JUST COOL I YOU KNOW THE NECK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY AND CREATE A SYSTEMIC OR WHOLE BODY COOLING IF THE GOLD IS TO BRING FEVER DOWN BUT IN MANY CASES FEVER IS ADAPTIVE AND SO TAKING A NONSERAT AND DI INFLAMATORY DRUGS LIKE A O ADVILL ANTALAN ALL SOMETIMES CAN BE GOOD IF THAT'S RECOMMENDED BUT OTHER TIMES BECAUSE IT REDUCES YOUR FEVER IT'S ALLOWING THAT PATHAGIN THAT PYROGIN IT SOMETIMES CALLED A PYROGIN IS A SUBSTANCE THAT CAUSES FEVER THINK PIRO THINK FIRE THIN PIROMANIACS THINK PIRO THOSE PYIROGINS CAN SURVIVE IT MODERATE TO LOW TEMPERATURES AND THE CAN'T SURVIVE AT HIGH TEMPERATURE SO THE FEVER IS AN ADAPTIVE MECHANISM AND THE OVIELTEA AND THE SENSING OF YOUR CHEMISTRY IS HOW THE OVIELTY ORGANON VASCALOSUM AN LATERO TERMINALICE DOES THAT SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SENSING LONG VOLUME SPEED OF OUR HEART BEAT WE TALKED ABOUT SENSING THE GUT VOLUME THE INTESTINAL VOLUME OR THE ABSENCE OF VOLUME WE TALKED ABOUT CHEMISTRY OF THE GUT AND THE GUT MICROBIODA AND ON AMUNE FUNCTIONS AND WE'VE NOW TALKED ABOUT VOMITING AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FEVER LOTS OF ASPECTS OF SENSING OUR INTERNAL SELF NOW I WANT TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO IN TERRACEPTION AS IT RELATES TO FEELINGS THE WAY THAT INTERRECEPTION IS MOST COMMONLY DESCRIBED AND I WANT A HIGHLIGHT A TERM THAT MANY VIEW HAVE PROBABLY HEARD WHICH IS THE VAGUEST NERVE WE TALKED ABOUT VAGUUST A LITTLE BUT EARLIER BUT THE VAGUEST NERVE THIS VAGABONDING WANDERING NERVE IS INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW AND THE REASON I SAVED IT TILL NOW RATHER THAN MENTION ALL LONG IS TO ILIGHT A SPECIFIC POINT WHICH IS THAT WHENEVER WE HEAR ABOUT THE VAGUEST IN POPULAR CULTURITS LIKE THE VAGUEST CALMS YOU DOWN YOU WANT TO STIMULATE THE VAGUEST BY RUBBING IN FRONT OF THE EAR AND IT'S A PARASYMPATHETIC NERVE AND UWILL CALM YOU DOWN O MELLO YOU OUT ACTUALLY MOST OF THE TIME THE VAGUEST IS STIMULATORY WHEN YOU GEST FOODS WITH HE MENOACID SUGARS OR PHATIACIDS THE VAGUEST NERVE GETS ACTIVATED AND TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF DOPENING AT MAKES YOU MORE ALERT AND GO SEEK MORE OF THOSE FOOODS OR WHAT LED TO THOSE CONDITIONS WHEN YOU FEEL NAUCIOUS IT'S RARELY CALMING WHEN YOU FEEL LIK YOU HAVE A FEVER IT'S RARELY CALMING SO YOU'SE TRYING TO GET THE PICTURE THAT EVEN THOUGH THE VAGUEST NERVE IS IN THE PERASYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IF THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU CAUSE YOU'RE NOT ANEPHICIONATO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BUT IT'S NOT A CALMING SYSTEM IT'S A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND IT'S A MOTOR SYSTEM IT COMMUNICATES BRAINED TO BODY AND BODY TO BRAIN AND IT CHANGES THE FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT ORGANS NOW ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT STRESS ITSELF WE'LL ALTER THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR GUT BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT IT SHUTS DOWN THE VAGUEST NERVE AND QUIETS THE NURONS THAT COMMUNICATE FROM GOT TO BRAIN I WANT TO SAY THAT AGAIN STRESS WILL DISRUPT YOUR GUT AND MAKE YOU FEEL NOT GOOD POOR DIGESTION AND JUST LOUSY BECAUSE OF THE WAY TI THAT IT SHUTS DOWN THE VAGUEST NERVE AND THE NURANS OF YOUR GUT SO WHAT STRESS DOES IS IT BLOCKS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN GOT AND BRAIN IT DOESN'T MESS UP YOUR GOT IT JUST DOESN'T LET YOUR GOT GET THE SIGNALS UP TO YOUR BRAIN AND IT ALSO THEN THROWS OFF THE CHEMISTRY AND THN THERE'S A WHOLE CASCADE OF EFFECTS FYOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT STRESSA DID A WHOLE EPISODE CALLED MASTER STRESSOR I THINK MAY Y WAS CALL CONCERSTRESSING WAS MASTER STRESS EITHER ONE THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT EPISODE IS TO GIVE YOU TOOLS AND PRACTICES TO DEAL WITH SHORT TERM ACUTE STRESS MODERATE TERMS TRESS AND LONG TERM CHRONIC STRESS THROUGH BEHAVIOR OL MECHANISMS NEUTRITION SUPPLEMENTATION AND MANY OTHER THINGS AS WELL IT'S CHALK A BLOCK FUL OF PROTOCOLS AND TOOLS FOR STRESS THE VAGUEST NERVE HOWEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EMOTION AND THE WAY IT DOES THAT IS TO POOL TO AGGREGATE THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR GUT THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR HEART AND THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR BREATHING WHICH INCLUDES YOUR DIFHRAME AND LUNGS AND TAKES THAT KON OF ASA A COLLECTION OF INFORMATION AND SENDS IT TO THE BRAIN AND CONTROLS WHAT WE CALL YOUR EMOTIONS NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS TO SOME PEOPIL BUT TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT MIGHT SEEM TOLLY CRAZY YOU THOUGHT YOUR EMOTIONS WERE BECAUSE THE MARKET WAS DOWN AND YOU HAD INVESTED OR BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OR BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THAT SCHOOL WAS CON OPEN AND THEN IT'S NOT OR MAY YOU THOUGHT IT WASN'T AND IT IS WHATEVER IT IS THAT BOTHERS YOU YOU THINK OF GENERALLY AS A PURELY COGNAT OF EVENT BUT THE BRAIN DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION IT DOESN'T ACT DIRECTLY ON THAT INFORMATION TO CREATE MOODS MOODS ARE CREATED THROUGH THE HEARTS RESPONSE TO READING THAT HEADLIME TO THE CHANGE IN YOUR BREATHING THAT'S CAUSED BY SOME ONE THAT YOU LOVE TELLING YOU THAT ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT INTEREST IN SPENDING TIME WITH YOU ANY MORE OR THAT YOU SCREWED UP OR THAT THEYRE INTEREST IN SPENDING A LON OF TIME WITH YOU AND YOU LIKE THAT RIGHT EMOTIONS CAN BE GOOD OR BAD OR NEUTRAL SO THIS THING THAT WE CALL INTERRECEPTION THE SENSE OF SELF I'VE BEEN BUILDING UP FROM VERY FUNDAMENTAL LAYERS GOT CHEMISTRY SPLEENS AMUNE SYSTEMS AUTUUM UN AND YOU MIGHT HAVE BEE THINGING MADE I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT A SENSE OF SELF A NOTICING OR A FEELING AND INDEED ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE PLUGGING IN LIKE A SERIES OF INGREDIENTS IN A RECIPE THAT GIVES RISE TO YOUR MOOD AND HOW YOU FEEL AND THAT MOOD AND HOW YOU FEEL IS SHOWN IN ONE LOCATION IN YOUR BODY THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE AND THAT'S IN YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND INDEED THERE ARE NOW BEAUTIFUL DATA SHOWING THAT YOUR FACE INCLUDING THE SIZE OF YOUR PUPILS THE TONALITY OF YOUR FACE HOW FLUSHED YOU ARE OR HOW PALE YOU ARE EVEN THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOU ARE FROWNING OR SMILING RELATIVE TO OTHER PERIODS OF TIME THAT IS ALL AN AGGREGATE OF OR A REFLECTION RATHER OF YOUR GOT YOUR HEART AND YOUR BREATHING AND THE CHEMISTRY OF YOUR BODY AND SO THIS IS WHY IS OR BACKED INTO THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT INTERRACEPTION I KIND OF TROJAN HORSE THIS ON YOU ON PURPOSE WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE VAGUEST AND YOU HEAR OH YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET VAGAL TONE BY BREATHING OR RUBBING ON THE FRONT OF THE ARE SURT THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE BUT ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL LAYER IS THE ASCIDITY OF YOUR GOT HOW FAST YOUR BREATHING ARE YOU INHALE EMPHASIZED ARE IN HILL OR EXALE EMPHASIZED BREATHING WHEN WE ARE RELAXD ARE PUPILS TEND TO CONSTRICT WHEN WE ARE VERY ALERT AUR PEOPLE'S TEND TO BE DILATED WHETHER NOT THAT ALERTNESS HAS TO DO WITH BEING HAPPY OR BEING SAD AND WHAT'S REMARKABLE AND THIS IS WHERE IN TERRECEPTION REALLY REALLY TAKES A LEAP INTO THE INCREDIBLE IS THAT THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE KNOW SOMEBODY PRETTY WELL AND THEY ARE GOING THROUGH SOME SORT OF EXPERIENCE OF ANY KIND OUR HEART RATE ACTUALLY STARTS TO MIMIC THEIR HEART RATE OUR BREATHING STARTS TO MIMIC THEIR BREATHING EVEN IF WE AREN'T CONSCIOUS OF THEIR BREATHING IS NOT LIKE WE SEE THEIR CHEST HEAVING AND WE THINK OMAGONISTS AND THEN WE BREATHE THAT WAY THERE'S A MIRRORING AND NOW IT'S NOT CARRIED OUT THROUGH MIRROR NERANS MIRINRONS ARE MORE OF A MITH THAN A REALITY SORRY TO BURST OF PEOPLE'S BUBBLES BUT THAT BUBBLE AROUND MERINRANS IS DEAFINLY MADE OF MYTHS AND A TOPIC FOR ANOTHER TIME BUT WE START TO MIRROR SOMEHOW HUMAN BEINGS ARE ABLE TO REGISTER THE INTERNAL STATE OF OTHER BEINGS AND I THINK PROBABLY FOR ANIMALS TOO BUT CERTAINLY FOR OTHER HUMANS EVEN AT A DISTANCE AND THESE STUDIES ARE MANY NOW AND AND THEIRE REALLY WONDERFUL STUDIES AND SO YOUR SENSE OF YOUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE IS LINKED TO OTHERS NOW YOU CAN ENHANCE THIS INTERROCEPTIVE CAPACITY FOR HOW YOU FEEL AND HOW OTHERS FEEL IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN START GETTING A BETTER READ OUT OF YOUR INTERNAL STATE BY DOING A SIMPLE TO EXERCISE WHAT IS REALLY A TOOL AND THAT IS TO LEARN TO SENSE YOUR HEART BEATS SO SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY GOOD AT THIS OTHER PEOPLE OR NOT SOME PEOPLE CAN DO THIS MORE EASILY WHEN THEY HAVE ALL THEIR AIR EXILED AND SOME PEOPLE CAN DO IT BETTER WHEN THEY ARE HOLDING A BREATHHOLD BUT ONE THING THAT'S KIND OF COOL ABOUT THIS WHOLE INTERRECEPTIVE CAPACITY IS THAT YOU CAN ENHANCE IT VERY VERY QUICKLY YOU CAN LEARN OR TEACH YOURSELF TO HAVE HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF INTERRECEPTION IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY JUST GIVE YOURSELF HEIGHTEND LEVELS OF VISION BY SNAPPING YOUR FINGERS IN ONE ONE ROUND OF ONE TOOL AR EXERCISE THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVISION THAT'S THE TOPIC OF A PREVIOUS EPISODE I INCURS YOU O LOOK IT UP THERE TINGS YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE YOUR HEARING AND YOUR TASTE AND YOUR SMELL WE TALKED ABOUT ALL THOSE BUT WITH INTERRECEPTION YOU CAN GET VERY GOOD AT THIS VERY FAST ANDI THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MET ITATION IS POWERFUL THINK THEYRE LATTEREASS Y MEDITATIONS POWERFUL BUT ONE O THE REASONS IS WHEN YOU STOP TAKING IN EXTERROCEPTIVE INFORMATION INFORMATION FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD BY CLOSING YOUR EYES IN FOCUSSING INWARD AS THEY SAY YOU START PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR BREATHING CADENCE YOU START DIRECTING YOUR MINDS ATTENTION TO YOUR HEART RIGHT AND IF YOU CAN START TO PERCEIVE YOUR HEART BEATING YOU ACTUALLY ARE VERY QUICKLY STRENGTHEN THE VAGAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE BRAIN AND SO THERE'S NO REAL PRACTICE HERE THERE'S NO BREATHE THIS WAY OR DO THIS THING EXCEPT TO DIRECT YOUR AWARENESS TOWARD YOUR HEARTBEAT AND SOME PEOPLE CAN GET VERY GOOD AT THIS VERY FAST MOST PEOPLE FIND THAT JUST BY DOING THIS FOR A MINUTE OR SO EVERY ONCES IN AWHILE THEY START TO TAP INTO THIS SUCCENSE THEY START TO NOTICE WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT ABOUT SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY OR SOME SITUATION OR THEY START TO NOTICE WHEN THEY FEEL QUITE RIGHT ABOUT SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING OR SOME SITUATION SO THIT'S INTERROCEPTIVE AWARENESS CAN BE TUNED UP WICH IT USED TO BE CALLED VAGAL TONE BUT I THINK THAT TERM DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON WITH HA VAGUS SO I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT TERM IT'S MORE OF AN INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS AND AGAIN THEREARE MANY STUDIES NOW SHOWING THAT FORSAKE OF BETTERING ONE'S MOOD OVER ALL FORSAKE OF MOVING THROUGH A CHALLENGING PHASE IN LIFE FORSAKE OF JUST ENHANCING ONE'S EXPERIENCE OF LIFE OVER ALL WHETHER NOT ITS THE TASTE OFE FOODS INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE ENJOYMENT FOCUS PLEASURE TUNING UP ONE'S IN TERROCEPTIVE AWARENESS IS BOTH EASY AGAIN BY JUST TAKING A MINUTE OR TWO AND TRYING TO COUNT HEARTBEATS AND THEN THIS WORKS BEST OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE SOME INDEPENDENT READ OUT OF HEART BEATS AND YOU CAN COMPARE YOU CAN SEE HOW ACCURATE YOURE AL YOU ARE BUT EVEN EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE A DEVICE OR HAVE A DEVICE TO DO THAT WITHOUT TAKING YOUR PULSE USING YOUR THUMB ON YOUR WRIST OR SOMETHING OR YOUR FINGER ON YOUR NECK AS YOU TYPICALLY WOULD FOR TAKING YOUR PULSE TRYING TO SIT STILL FOR A MINUTE OR TO EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE MAY BE ONCE A WEEK MAY BE TWICE A WEEK MAYBE WHILE YOUR MEDITATING MAYBE WHILE BREATHWORK MAY BE DURING THE BREATHHOLDS OF BREATHWORK YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO DO THIS IN ANY KIND OF EXTENDED WAY YOU CAN VERY QUICKLY INCREASE YOUR INTERRACEPTIVE TONE AND THAT HAS A HUGE AND OUTSIZED EFFECT ON THE BRAIN BODY RELATIONSHIP AND YOUR BRAINS ABILITY TO TAP INTO BOTH THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND THE CONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL SIGNALING THAT'S HAPPENING ALL THE TIME ND IT CAN HAVE REAL AND OUTSIZED PAUSIVE EFFECTS ON YOUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AT WORK AND YOUR ABILITY TO NOTICE AH I'M FINDING MYSELF IND OF FEELING LIKE I'M LOSING FOCUS BUT REALLY IT WAS MY HEART RATE WAS JUST INCREASING MAYBE I JUST EXCELABIT AND BRING MY HEARTRIGHT DOWN SO WHAT HAVE EFFECTUALLY TRIED TO DO TO DAY IS TO GIVE YOU A WINDOW INTO THE INCREDIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR VICIR AND YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR VISOR ALL THESE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY AND I WHAT I HOPE IS THAT YOU APPRECIATE THAT IT'S A SYSTEM THAT YOU AREN'T JUST A SYSTEM OF TUBES I SAID THAT IN SORT OF INJEST I M YOU HAVE A LOTO TUBES AND YOU ARE A SYSTEM OF TUBES BUT THAT SYSTEM OF TUBES IS LINKED THROUGH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THOSE LINKS WORK IN VARIOUS SPECIFIC WAY SO WHETHER NOT YOU REMEMBER ABOUT PIEZOS AND ALL THE GIO PU WONARS AND ALL THAT SDOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT I ENCURGE YOU TO DO IS START SO AF PUSHING AND PULLING ON THE VARIOUS LEVERS WITHIN THIS BEAUTIFUL SYSTEM THAT WE CALL THE INTERRACEPTIVE SYSTEM THIS

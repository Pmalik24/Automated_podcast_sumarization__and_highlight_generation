WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAD GUEST SERIES WHERE I AND AN EXPERT GEST I US SCIENCE AN SCIENCE AST TO RNIN I MAND YOUR HUBERMEN AND OM OUR PROFESSOR OF NEURBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS THE FIFTH IN A SIX EPISODE SERIES ON FITNESS EXERCISE AND PERFORMANCE AND TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALL ABOUT RECOVERY THAT IS HOW TO MAXIMISZE YOUR RECOVERY TO ACHIEVE YOUR FITNESS AND EXERCISE AND PERFORMANC SCHOOLS AND HOW TO AVOID OVERTRAINING DOCTOR ANTO YALPIN GREAY TO BE BACK TO DAY WE'RE DISCUSSING RECOVERY AND I'M VERY SIDY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE AS WE KNOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXERCISE CAN BE USED TO TRIGGER DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADAPTATION SUCH AS INCREASED LONG DISTANCE ENDURANCE ANEROBIC CAPACITY STRENGTH HYPERTROPHY ET CETERA THE WORKOUTS THEMSELVES ARE NOT ACTUALLY WHEN THE PROGRESS OCCURS WHEN THE ADAPTATION OCCURS AND THIS TO ME IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT PARALLELS WHAT WE SEE WITH CICCLED NERO PLASTICITY WHICH IS NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY IS CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE WE SIT DOWN TO LEARN SOMETHING WE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING AND THAT IS THE TRIGGER FOR REWUIRING OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT THE ACTUAL REQWUIRING OCCURS AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE ORE THE LEARNING SO TO IN FITNESS AND IN EXERCISE RECOVERY IS WHERE THE REAL RESULTS ACTUALLY EMERGE WHERE WE GET BETTER SO I LOVE FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN WHAT RECOVERY REALLY IS AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RECOVERY CERTAINLY DIFFEN WAYS TO ENHANCE RECOVERY AND I'D ALSO LOVE FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN WHETHER OR NOT THEIR WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN BECOME BETTER AT RECOVERING BECAUSE IF INDEED RECOVERY IS WHEN PROGRESS EMERGES WHEN WE GET BETTER WILL THEN ANYTHING THAT SUPPORTS OUR RECOVERY AND GETS US BETTER AT RECOVERING OUGHT TO INCREASE OURE RATE IN OUR DEGREE OF PROGRESS ABSOLUTELY YOU NAILED IT IN THE DESCRIPTION WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT IS SOME SORT OF CHANGE WHETHER YOU ARE TALKING ALF LEADES OR GENERAL POPULATION THIS CHANGE IS SOME SORT OF IMPROVEMENT AND MUSCLE FUNCTION REDUCTION BODY FAT HIGHER FUNCTIONING TE TABILISM WHATEVER THE CASES AND THE ONLY WAY THAT HAPPENS IS WE TALK ABOUT THE EQUATION OF STRESS CAUSES ADAPTATION BUT AS YOU ALLUDED TO THE PIECE IN THE MIDDLE IS ONLY IF YOU CAN RECOVER FROM IT AND SO THE GAME ORE PLAYING HERE IS WE ALL AGREE WEANT MORE ADAPTATION THAT MEANS WE NEED TO BRING MORE STRESS IN THE SYSTEM BUT WE THEN HALVE TO INSURE THAT OUR RECOVERY OUT PACES THE STRESS AND PUT OR ELSE WILL NO ADAPTATIONAL COR IN OFFACT WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU WILL ACTUALLY BE A NEGATIVE SPOT ING START GOING BACKWARDS AND SO WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO IS IS TALK ABOUT HOW WE'VE HANDLED THIS AND I'VE HAD A DECENT AMOUT OF EXPERIENCE HERE I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DO MY MASTERS DEGREE AND THE LABORATORY OF A GENTLEMAN IN ANDY FRY WHOSE AN ENASYA LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT OWORD WINTER AND HE STUDIED IN LARGE PART RECOVERY OVERTRAINING OVER USE OVERLOWED IN A LOT OF AREAS IN ADDITION I'VE BEEN FORTUNE ENOUGH TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS FROM HIGH FUNCTIONING SEA OS AND EXECUTIVES WHO HAVE LITTLE TIME FOR RECOVERY HIGH JOBSTRAS TO INTWO ATHLETES IN IT THINK OF THE EXAMPLE OF PICTURES AND MADELY BASEPOT WHO HAVE TO RECOVER IN A MATTER OF FORDAYS THAT THEY CAN PITCH AGAIN AT MAXIM VELOCITY SO I WOULD LOVE TO OUTLINE SOME OF THE TOOLS AND TACTICS STRATEGIES WE USE FOR ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS GIVE YOU SOME FOUNDATIONAL STUFF AND I WOULD LOVE TO MAY BE ACTUALLY COVER SOME THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SOME STUFFY MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SOME TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE USE SOME BILE MARKERS AND THEN EVEN A WHOLE MUNCH OF THINGS THAT ARE KEEPING WITH A THING OF YOUR SHOW HERE COSTFREY OR EXTREMELY LOW COST SO ALL THOSE STRATEGIES BUT OUGHT ALSO LIKE TO DO IS COVER NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTATION AND FUELING AND HYDRATION IN THINGS BUT THAT'S PROBABLY GOINE A HALVE TO BE SAVED FOR AN ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION THAT WILL DO IN THE NEXT EPISODE YES SOR WE WILL ABSOLUTELY HOLD A CONVERSATION ABOUT NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION WHERE YOU CAN EDUCATE US ABOUT ALL THE TOP CONTOUR STUFF ALL THE WAY DOWN TO  THE FINE DETAILES I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT RECOVERY AND IT'S ONE THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEMSELVES WHICH IS SORENESS WE THINK OF IT AS MUSCLE SORENESS BUT I WAS TRAINED EARLY ON IN MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER TO ALWAYS QUESTION THE SEEMINGLY OBVIOUS SO COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT SORENESS FIRST OF ALL WHAT DOES SORENESS REALLY REFLECT IS IT REALLY MUSCLE SORENESS IT FEELS LIKE ITS IN THE MUSCLES A BUT WHAT OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS AND TISSUES IN SELTYPES DOES IT INVOLVE AND THEN I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS UNSEPT OR THIS EXPERIENCE THAT MANY OF US INCLUDING MYSELF HAD WHICH IS DELAYED ONSET MUSCLE SORENESS WHY WOULD IT BE THAT WHEN WE ARE LESS IN SHAPE OR WHEN WE PERFORM A MOVEMENT THAT IS EXTREMELY NOVEL TO US THE SORENESS SEEMS TO ARRIVE AFTER A REASONABLE DELAY OF MAYBE VEN A DAY YOU KNOW WHULD FIND THE NEXT DAY BU THAN FORTYEIGHT HOURS LATER WE ARE EXCEEDINGLY SORE AND AS WE GET MORE FIT OR MORE FAMILIAR WITH A MOVEMENT THE SORENESS SEEMS TO ARRIVE EARLIER I REALISE THI JUST ASKE YOU ABOUT THREE QUESTIONS OR MORE FORSOET WHAT IS MUSCLE SORENESS AT A SELLER LEVEL WHICH SELLS WHICH ORGAN SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH WHAT IS IT MEAN IF WE ARE SORE SOMETHING I KNOW WILL GET INTO A AIT LATER ANDTHEN WHY THE DELAYED ONSET MUSCLE SORENESS IT'S ACTUALLY ONE QUESTION SO IT'S TOTALLY FIND YOU ANSWERED OF YE ASKED ALL THREE BECAUSE I AM NOT ACTUALLY ANSWER IN A ER THREE WHICH LANSTERNOM OR TWO WHICH WILL ACTUALLY ONSWERNOER ONE I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU THAT I SET IT UP  THAT WAY INTENTIONALLY BUI'VE JUST HAPPY TO HEAR THAT WHERE I WAS UNABLE TO BE CONCISE YOU ARE ABLE TO BE CONCISE THAND YET WE ARE STILL LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THIS AREA IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO PERFORM THESE STUDIES ANY TIME YOU ASK AT QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE PAIN OR SORENESS YOUR IMMEDIATELY TALKING ABOUT PERCEPTION AND THERE IS OBVISY OF PHYSICAL COMPONENT TO THAT AND THERE'S ALCLE PERCEPTION AND SO TEASING THOSE THINGS OUT IS EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING THATS SAID THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREAN IN FACT PROBABLY I'M YOU MAY HAVE A SHOW ALREADY OUT ON PAIN OR MAY BE ONCE COMING DOWN THE ROAD WE DID AN EPISODE ON PAIN A A WHILE AGO BUT IT'S DEFFLING TIME TO REVISIT THAT LITERATURE I ELSE O HAVE SOME AMAZING COLLEAGUES AT STAMFORD WHO WORK ON PAIN BOTH FROM THE A SELLER MOLECULAR SIDE BUT ALSO FROM THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE ABOUT HOW AR A UNDERSTANDING WITH PAIN AN WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT PAIN SHAPES THE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN AND PAIN RELIEF AMAZING THAT'S THAT STUFFIS INCREDILING BE IMPORTANT AND I'M A I'M GLAD WE FLAG THAT IN MAY BE WILL TIS CALL THAT GOOD FOR NOWTICAND COME BACK LATER FOR ANONE OF ENERSHOWS SO THT BEING SAID WHYT DOES IT HAPPEN A TWENTY EIGHT TO FORTY IGHT HOURS AFTER YOU EXERCISE WILL THAT ACTULY SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME CLUES INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING SO THE TRADITIONAL DOGMA OF DELAYED ON SET MUSCLE SORENESS IS WHAT THIS IS CALLED IS THAT IT IS A RESULT OF COINC MICRO TAIRS IN THE MUSCLE AND SO YOU CON SORT OF THING I CHALLENGE THE MUSCLE THERE WARE SOME SMALL TARS IN THERE AND I'M FEELING THE RESULTS THAT WELL IN FACT THAT CERTAINLY DOES HAPPEN AND IT CAN HAPPEN THAT IS NOT WHAT'S EXPLAINING YOUR MUSCLE SORENESS AND IN FACT YOU CAN BE QUITE SORE FROM EXERCISE AND HAVE NO MEASURABLE AMOUNT OF MUSCLE DAMAGE ND SO MUCH LIKE ANYTHING ELSE ARE IN THIS IDEA OF PAIN IT'S NOT A ONE TO ONE EXPLANATION THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT ARE PROBABLY CAUSING YOUR PERCEPTION OF PAIN MUSCLE DAMAGE CAN BE ONE OF THEM IT IS NOT THE ONLY ONE IT IS PROBABLY IN MY OPINION THOU THE IS YET TO BE SHOWN DEFINITIVELY PROBABLY NOT EVEN THE LEADING CAUSE OF IT AND SO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WELL THE REASON IS TAKING YOU TWENTY FOR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS IS IS YOU CANACTUALLY I FIND VARIOUS PAPERS A LITERATURE VIEWS STATING BACK IN A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW GO OVER DECADE THAT SHOW THESE WONDERFUL CURVES OF AN INFALAMITORY AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AND AND WE DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY RIGHT NOW BUT EFFECTIVELY WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THOSE THINGS HAVE A LITTLABIT F A TIME DELAY AND SO SOME OF THOSE STEPS HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY LI RIGHT WHEN THE EXERCISES THERE IND THE SOME OF THEM ARE DELAYED SIX TO TWENTY FOR TO FORTYEIGHT HOURS IIF YOU KNOW LITTL BIT ABOUT THIS A PHYSIOLOGY ITS YOU AVE A COMBINATION OF NEUTRA PHILLS AND MACRIPHAGES IN A MUNCH OF THINGS HAPPENING AN THIS AYS A TIME SEQUON SO WHAT HAPPENS IS BUT A TIME WE GET TO THIS TWENTY EIGHT TO FORTY EIGHT HOUR WINDOW NOW THE MUSCLESORENESS KICKSON WHICH WAIT A MINUTE IF I IF THIS WAS HA RESULT TOF MY MUSCLES BEING TORN AND THAT HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY WOULDN'T THAT PAIN START IMMEDIATELY WEITLL ANSWER AS IT WOULD AND SO THAT THAT THAT IS YOUR FIRST CLUE THAT THAT'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IT WHEN WE LOOK AT TH T A MUN RESPONSE AND WE SEE THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY PK TWENTY FORTO FORTYEIGHT HOURS LATER AND THEND THAT'S THE SAME TIME THE PAINCAKED AND THAT'S CALLING YOU I THE PROBLEM SO WE HAVE THIS IMUNE RESPONSE HAPPENING AND INFLAMMATION THEN ALL THE SUDDEN WE START GETTING FLUID ACCUMULATION AND NOW THERE ARE WHAT ARE CALLED NOSYCEPTORS AND YOUR PROBABLY VERY OVICY YOUR VERY ORMIT THESE ARNE THESE YOUR PAIN RECEPPERS WHAT'S ACTUALLY INTERESTING AS WE DON'T NECESSARILY NO A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY PAIN RECEPTORS ARE IN MUSCLE THEY'RE NOT REALLY IN THE BELLY IN FACT THIS IS WHY I CAN PERFORM MY MUSCLE BY OPSIES AND THEY DON'T REALLY HURT YOU MEAN IN THE BELLY OF THE MUSCLE CORRECT  WE DO HAVE PRESSURE SENSOR SO AND SO IF YOU CHANGE THE VOLUME OF THE TISSUE YOU WILL RESPOND TO THAT VERY VERY QUICKLY SO BY ANHANCING SWELLING IN THE ACTUAL MUSCLE THAT IS IMMEDIATELY PUTTING PRESSURE ON THOSE PRESSURE RECEPTORS IF YOU WILL THAT'S THE SIGNAL SO WHAT'S PROBABLY HAPPEN HERE AND I JUST I JUST HATE TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER BONE BUT A LOT OF DELAYED ON THE MUSCLE SORNESS IS PROBABLY JUST A NURL FEEDBACCLUP RATHER THAN IT ISACT FAL MUSCLE DAMAGE A MIXS A LOT SENSE THERE'S A LOT OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE A TYPES OF NURONS THAT CONTROL TOUCH SENSATION AND PAIN SENSATION AN ITH SENSATION INVATE A LOT OF PEOPLE A KIND OF COLLAPSE ITCH AN PAIN TEGOTHER BINGO YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING IT'S PAINFUL ENDIT ITCH IS IS IS A FAMILIAR THING FOR PEOPLE MOSQUITO BITES IN SUCH AM AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE A CLASSIC GAT THEORY OF PAIN A YE WHICH A PEOPLE WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH IND THEN ALL EXPLAIN WHY I'M EXPLAINING THIS AM WHICH IS IF YOU YOU SOMETHING HURTS YOU AR YOU BONK YOUR NEAR STUB YOUR TOE WE TEND TO GRAB THAT BODY PART AND TRYIN TO RUB IT SO AND THAT RUBBING IS NOT A COINCIDENTAL THING IT ACTIVATES A SET OF A TOUCH SENSORS THATARE THAT RESPOND TO COND OF BROAD DULL TOUCH AM AND THAT ACTIVELY INHIBITS THROUGH THE RELEASE OF AN HIBI TORY NOR TRANSMITTER THE FIBRS THAT CONTROL THE PAINSIGNAL SO ANY TIME WE WE RUB IT YOU KNOW LIKE A CHARLEY HORSE OUR LEG OR WE OR WE STUB OUR TO IND WE YOU KNOW WE WINCE IN THEN WE GRAB THE TONE WE GOT LIKE SQUEEZING ELO BIT THAT'S ACTUALLY DEACTIVATING WERE PARTIALLY INACTIVATING THE THE PAIN MECHANISM SO THE IDEA THAT A A SWELLING RESPONSE WOULD THEN TRIGGER A NURL RESPONSE THAT THE THEN WOULD RECRUIT THE PEEN RECEPTOR RESPONSE YOU'R AMUSING BROAD BROADBRUSH AM STROKES HERE TO EXPLAIN THIS  MAKES VERY GOOD SENSE TO ME A NOW AND ONLY NOW THAT YOU'VE EXPLAINED HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS I CAN ACTUALLY EVEN ADD MORE TO THAT SO IF YOU REMEMBER HOW MUSCLES WORK SO WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SIGNAL FROM THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT HAS TO ACTUALLY GO IN AND TELL THE MUSCLE TO CONTRACT WELL REMEMBER THERE A FEW EPISODES TOGO WE COVERED THE PHYSIOLOGY HERE OF WHAT'S CALLED A MOTOR UNIT AY WLE WHAT I DIDN'T EXPLAIN TO ARE CALLED MUSCLE SPINDLES AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT PROPERACEPTION IN AN EPISOD O BEFORE I S WELL BUT WE NEVER TIE THIS PICTURETOGETHER SO LE ME WALKIN THOUGH THAT REALLY QUICKLY AND IT'S CAN ATIE THIS SLUPITAN INONI SPOKE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS A THIS MOTOR UNIT IS IS COMING IN FROM WHAT'S CALLED AN ALFA MOTOR UNIT AND THAT'S GOING BE ENERVATING YOUR MUSCLE FIBRES ND THAT'S GONG TO TELL THE MUSCLE FIBRS TO CONTRACT THOSE ARE TYPICALLY SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE A ALALL SIDES OF THE MUSCLE IN INTERIOR EXTERIOLIVER ON THE OUTSIDE THOUGH THERE IS ANOTHER TYPE OF MUSCLE CALLED A MUSCLE SPINDLE NOW THESE ARE NON CONTRACTILE SO THEY DON'T HAVE THAT ACT IN AN MYACIN AND THEY DON'T PRODUCE FORCE THEY ARE RESPONSIVE THEY ARE PROPROUSEPTIVE SO W AT THAT MEANS IS THEY SENSE STRETCH AND THIS IS WHY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE TO I'M STRETCH A HANDSTRING AND CHECKANY MUSCLE GRIP IT OESN'T EALLY MATTER OR MUSCLE IT'S INNATE RESPONSE IS TO FIRE BACK TO CLOSE THAT DISTANCE AND THIS IS WHAT KEEPS YOU FROM SAVFE YOUR LEANNG TO THE RIGHT A YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE EXAMPLE GIVE IS IF YOUR EUR FURSTANDING ON ONE FOOT AND YOU START SWAYING TO THE RIGHT I LEST SAY YOU'R STANDIG ON YOUR RIGHT FOOT AN THIS MAKE THIS EASIER FROR FOLKS YOU START SWAYING TO THE RIGHT LIKE YOU GOINGTO FALL ON YOUR RIGHT EAR WILL HIT THE GROUND THE INSIDE OF YOUR RIGHT CALF MUSCLE WILL START BEING STRETHED THE OUTSIDE WILL START BEING COMPRESSED RIGHT SO THES STRETCH ON THE INSIDE OF THE RIGHT CALF MUSCLE WILL SENSE THAT STRETCH AND IT WILL RESPOND BY CONTRACTING THAT PULLS YOU BACK TO THE MIDDLE AND STOPS YOU FROM FALLING THAT'S PROPROCEPTION AND MUSCLESPINDLE SEND STRETCHE AND TELL YOU TO CONTRACT THE WAY IF THEY WORK IS IS THROUGH GAMA MOTOR NURONS AND SO THESE ARE CENSORY THING SO WIT'S HAPPENING IS UNLIKE WHEN YOU TELL YOUR MUSCLE TO CONTRACT IT GOES ALFA TO THE MUSCLE CONTRACT THESE MUSCLE SPINDLES WORK SUCH THAT IT IS OH I'VE BEEN STRETCHED SEND SIGNAL BACT TO SOME CENTRAL POINT TYPICALLY IN THE SPINAL CORD AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY ONE AGLE ALL THUP THE BRAIN WE'VE GOT A TIME DELIGHT THIS IS WHY THESE ARE SUB CONSCIOUS AUTONOMIC RIGHTER RESISLOMATIC SO THA GAMMAS CAN GO BACK TO THE CENTRAL LOCATION AND THEN COME BACK THROUGH THE ALFA MOTOR NOR ON SINCE TILL IT TO CONTRACT SO YOU HAVE WHITH WONDERFUL MECHANISM OF SENSING STRETCH GOING BAC WELL ONE THEORY THATS BEEN PUT FORWARD REGARDING MUSCLE DAMAGE IS THAT THE PRESSUREIS ACTION BEING APPLIED TO THE NERVE ENDINGS OF THE MUSCLE SPINDLES AND THAT'S ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAIN SIGNAL THAT'S GOING BACT IN COMING UP TO YOUR BRAINING YOUR REGISTERING THAT ISPAIN RATHER THAN IT IS ACTUALLY IN THE THE CONTRACTILE UNITS SO THE MUSCLE FIBRES THE THAT'S A VERY INTRIGUING IDEA A BECAUSE IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT STRETCHING MUSCLES IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE SORENESS MIGHT BE THE EXACT INCORRECT THING TO DO YE NOW NOT SAYING THAT'S FOR SFOR CERTAIN I'M JUST BUILDING OFF THE MECHANISTIC LOGIC THAT WE'VE LAYD OUT HERE YE WEALLY THAT YOU LAY D OUT HERE THEREIS THE MORE EFFECTIVE PRINCIPLE BASED ON EXACTLY THAT WHICH IS IS AS WE DAREN'T GENERALLY WIDE LOW LEVEL MOVEMENT IS EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING CUTE SORTNESS NBECAUSE THAT'S NO LEVEL CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLE AND YOU'RE GET ANTI DATRACH AND GET TISSUE OUT AND YOU GET FLUIT OUT WELL YOU'RE ELY MOMPING IT OUT OF THE THE CELL YES AND IN OUR PREVIOUS EPISODE WHERE WE RE TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMMING OR USING THE WE BUT LET'S BE FAIRERD WHERE YOU WERE EDUCATIN US INCLUDING ME AM IN THE AUDIENCE ABOUT DIFFERENT STRUCTURES FOR PROGRAMMING EXERCISE FIR SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS ET CETERA THEM MONTH WEAK YEARS GET SCALES ET CETERA WE HAD A BRIEF A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF ONE TRAINS LEGS VERY HARD WITH RESISTANCE TRAINING SOME HEAVY SQUATDING OR DEAD LIFTING IT WER THAND THERE'S SOME SORENESS THAT OFTENTIMES DOING SOME QUOTI WHAT LIGHTER CARDIO OR AM SOME A LOW INPACT WORK THE NEXT DAY OR ER ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT INVOLVE A NOT HIGH INTENSITY A CONTRACTIONS THE MUSCLES BUT THAT DO REQUIRE CONTRACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES THAT IT CAN ALLEVIATE SORENESS MORE QUICKLY THAN IF ONE WERE SIMPLY LIE ROUND AND YOU KNON WHATCH AN AFLECS OR SOMETHING YET THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THE A TO GO BACK TOS LUBIT AS WELL THE IF THAT'S REALY THE CASE ATHE QUESTION IS LIKE WHERE IS THIS INFLAMMATORY SIGNAL COMING FROM AND WHILE THERE'S MUCH TO BE LEARNED THERE THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION RAT OUT SUGGEST IT'S POTENTIALLY COMING FROM FREE RADICALS RELEASE FROM THE MITCNDRE AGAIN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HOLD UP AS MORE RESEARCH COMS I'M NOT SHORT BUT IF YOU REMEMBER BACK TO OUR A CONVERSATION ON ENDURANC SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN AND A ROBIC METABOLISM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOURE NOT YOUR GETTING ENERGY FROM CLYCOLUSIS OR CARB HYDRATES REMEMBER THEY HAVE TO BE FINISHED THROUGH ROBIC METABOLISM SO EVEN IF YOU'RE LIFTING WEIGHTS AND YOU'RE USING CARBS FOR YOUR FUEL YOU HAVE GOT TO FINISH THAT METABOLISM BY RUNNING IN INTO TE MONOCHONDRE AND PERFORMING OXATED  METABLISM AS A RESULT OF THAT TATELECTORN TRANSPORT CHAIN RUNS SO THEORETICALLY IF FREE RADICALS WHICH IS ON WHICH OUR HIPER REACT OF OXYGEN SPECIES SPACILY THERE OF OXYGEN MOLECULES TAT ARE MISSING ELECTRON SO THAT THEY REACT TO A LOT OF THINGS THEY'RE THE OPPOSITEOF ANTIOXIDENTS BY THE WAYSIS THE OXEN MON GOES WITH EXTRA PROTON SO HET CAN BALANCE THE CHARGE IF THOSE LEAK OUT THAT END OF ITSELF IS GOING TO BE A MASS OF INFLAMMATORY SIGNAL AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT SIGNALS THE CAUSE OF THESE NEUTRA PILLS AND MACROPHAGES AND GETS OFF THIS ENTIRE CASCADE AGAIN I I BELIEVE WE NEED MARESEARCH THERE I NEED TO LOOK INTO A MAYBE'S MORE DEFINITIVE THAN I THAT I KNOW BUT THT'S PROBABLY WHAT'S HAPPENING POTENTIALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING RATHER THAT CAUSE IS THAT CASCADE IN SIGNAL ALSO  WHAT YOU HAVE IS HIS COMBINATION OF WILL IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY IM I NOT GETTING TRE MENDOUS AMOUNT O MUSCLE DAMAGE WHEN I DO MORE AROBIC BASED EXERCISE WELL BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MECHANICAL TENTION PULLING ON THE FIBRES THAT'S ACTUALLY CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE CELL WALL THAT ALLOWS THESE FREE RADICALS TO ESCAPE THE MITO CONDREA AND THE CELL ALSO THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN POSTULATE AT THIS MOMENT AS TO WHY THOSE TINGS ARE HAPPENING AND THEN WHY AGAIN LOW LEVEL EXERCISE TENDS TO AN HANDS NOT EVEN THINGS LIKE PRECUSSION A SO USING EITHER INSTRUMENT SAID BUT A LOW LEVEL OF VIBRATION IN YOUR LEG OR LIKE NOUMATIC BOOTS OMUSAGE ALL THESE THINGS ARE GENERALLY PROBABLY HELPING BECAUE THE'R MOVING THAT STUFF OUT I DEEMA MOST PECIFICALLY SO PRESSURE COMES OFF OF THOSE NERVE ENDINGS IN THE MUSCLE SPINDLES AN ALLOWS YOU TO STOP PERCEIVING THAT SIGNAL OF PAIN DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY REGENERATE TISSUE AT ALL YET FASCINATING AND I THINK THAT BEAUTIFULLY FRAMES WHERE WERE HEADED NEXT WHICH IS TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT MODES OF RECOVERY AND HOW TO ACCELERATE THEM AND PERHAPS EVEN HOW TO COMBINE DIFFERENT FORMS OF RECOVERY IN ORDER TO BECOME BETTER AT RECOVERING AND IN DOING SO MAKE FASTER PROGRESS OF FITNESS BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASISE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCHROLLS AT STAMFORT IT IS ALSO SEPARATE FOR DOCTOR ANDY GALPINS TEACHING AN RECEARTROLS AT CALSTATE FULLERTON IT IS HOWEVER PART OF OUR DESIRE AND EFFORTS TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME WE LIKE THO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS MOMENTUS MOMENTOUS MAKE SUPPLEMENTS OF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST IS PROUD TO BE PARTNERING WITH FORMENTUS FOR SEVERAL IMPORTANT REASONS FIRST OF ALL AS I MENTION THEIR SUPPLEMENTS ARE OF EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY SECOND OF ALL THEIR SUPPLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY IN SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCALL YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS MAINLY ONUSING SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS FITH SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS YOU CAN DEVISE THE MOST LOGICAL AND EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMENT FOR YOUR GOALS IN ADDITION MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENT SHIP INTERNATIONALL AND THIS IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT MANY OF THE HUBERMAN LAPODCAST LISTENERS RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS MENTION ON THE HUBERMANLAB PODCAST IN PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENTS FOR FORMON HEALTH FOR SLEEP OPPLIMIZATION FOR FOCUS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING EXERCISE RECOVERY YOU CAN GO TO LIVEMOMENTOUS SPELLED OUEST SO THAT LIVMOMENTOUS DOTCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT CONTAINS THE EXACT RATIOES OF THE ELECTROLITE SODIUM MAGNESUM IN POTASSIUM TE OPTIMIZE SELLER FUNCTIONING FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MOST PEOPLE REALIZE THAT HIDRATION IS KEY WE NEED TO INGEST INOUGH FLUIDS IN ORDER TO FEEL OUR BEST AN PERFORM OUR BEST BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE IS THAT THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR SELVES AND NERVE CELLS NURONS IN PARTICULAR REQUIRES THAT SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BE PRESENT IN THE CORRECT RATIOS NOW OF COURSE PEOPLE WITH PREHI PRETENTION AND HIGH PRETENTION NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THEIR SODIUMEN TAKE BUT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT IF YOU DRINK CAFHINE IF YOU EXERCISE AND IN PARTICULAR IF YOUR FALLING A VERY CLEAN DIET THAT IS NOT A LOT OF PROCESS FOODS WHICH OF COURSE IS A GOOD THING CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUG SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM TO OPTIMIZE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCEPACKED RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF PATASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM AND NO SUGAR IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S EL MN T DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET A FREE

SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY I'VE BEN USING AN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR ABOUT THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS AND IT HAS COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED MY SLEEP I'M SLEEPING ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT BUT I'M SLEEPING FAR DEEPER AND I'M NOW GETTING THE PROPER RATIOS OF SO CALLED RAPID I MOVENT OR REM SLEEP AND SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND WAKING UP FEELING FAR MORE RECOVERED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM FOR ALL THAT IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD I'VE TALKED MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT THE CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP AND BODY TEMPERATURE THAT IS IN ORDER TO FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT YOUR BODY NEEDS O DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES IN TERMS OF CUOR BODY TEMPERATURE AND WAKING UP INVOLVES A ONE TO THREE DEGREE INCREESE IN CUAR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVERS YOU CAN ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT TO BE ONE TEMPERATURE AT THE START OF THE NIGHT A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AND A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE AS YOU APPROACH MORNING EACH OF WHICH CAN PLACE YOU INTO THE OPTIMAL STAGES OF SLEEP AND HAVE YOU WAKING UP FEELING MORE REFRESHED THAN EVER IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DO ALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CHECK OUT THEIR POD THREE COVER AND SAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AT CHECKOUT EIHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U SSA CANDADA YUNITED KINGDOM SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO SAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AT CHECKOUT SO TO KICK OFF THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT RECOVERY AND WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT RECOVERYES WHEN THE SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS O EXERCISE ACTUALLY ECCUR I LOOVE FOR YOU TO SHARE WITH US WHAT HAPPENS OR NEEDS TO HAPPEN DURING RECOVERY IN ORDER FOR US TO GET BETER AT ANYTHING ENDURANCE STRENGTH ET CETERA BUT ALSO HOW SPECIFIC TYPES OF EXERCISE STIMULE AND SPECIFIC TYPES OF ADAPTATIONS THAT WE TRIGGER RUNNING A BIT FURTHER LIFTING A BIT MORE WEIGHT SLOWING THE CADENCE OF A GIVEN MOVEMENT ET CETERA HOW THOSE SPECIFIC TYPES OF TRIGGERS FOR ADAPTATION RELATE TO  SPECIFIC OR MAY BE SIMILAR TYPES OF RECOVERY THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR US TO MAKE PROGRESS IN ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS EPISODES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE HARVARD FATIGUE LAP REALLY IDENTIFY THIS IDEA OF HOMEO STASIS OUR LEAST SORT OF CHAMPIOND IT FOR IT THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AND ALL LEVELS PHYSIOLOGY WANTS TO RETURN TO HOEO STASS SO WHAT HAPPENS AN TERMS OF ADAPTATION IS YOU'VE CHALLENGED IT TO A LEVEL THAT IT REALIZES IF IT DOES NOT MAKE A CHANGE IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO A SAME LEVEL OF HOMEO STASIS THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT IS RECOVERY THAT PROCESS OF OF TAKING AN INSULT BEING TEMPOR RARELY REDUCED IN FUNCTIONALITY CAUSING A CHANGE SO THAT NOW WE COME BACK AND GET WIT WE OFTEN CALL IN FOR PERFORMANCE SUPERCOMPENSATION ALL THAT REALLY IS DOING NO IS BRINGING YOU TO A NEW LEVEL OF HOMEOSTASIS AFFACTIVELY IT IS UNDERSTANDING IF THAT SAME INSULT COMES AGAIN I NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T CAUSE THE SAME LEVEL OF DESTRUCTION AND SO WE RAISE THE BAR WHETHER THIS IS ENHANCING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE THE SAME LEVEL OF MECHANICAL TENSION ON THE MUSCLE AND NOT RESULT IN MYCRODAMAGE WHETHER THIS IS BEING ABLE TO TAKE THE SAME REDUCTION AND ENERGY AND NOT HAVE THAT COMPROMISE SLEEP OR ANYTHING TIT'S REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING SO WE CAN HAVE A NEW LEVEL OF HOMEOSTACIS BECAUSE IT'S PRESUMING TO PREDICTING THAT THAT SAME INSULT IS GOING TO COME AGAIN DOWN THE ROAD I WONT TO CLARIFIED FOR PEOPLE THAT WHEN DOCTOR JOLBIN SAYS INSULT WHILE HE MAY ACTUALLY INSULT ME A INSULT IS THE NURGESPEAK TERMINOLOGY FOR SOME SORT OF DAMAGE INFLICTED TO A TISSUER SYSTEM SO AM YE SPEAKING ABOUT THE INSULT TO THE MUSCLE OR INSULT TO THE NAURO MUSCULAR CONNECTION CREATED BY ADDING MORE WEIGHT TO THE BAR A RUNNING A FURTHER DISTANCE A  RUNNING A BIT FAST OR OR PEDDLING FASTER THAT CREATES A MICHRO INSULT OR AN INSULT AND NOW BECAUSE EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND VERBAL INSULTS FAR A YOU'LL NEVER FORGET THAT BIOLOGICAL CONCEPT IT'S IMPORTANT WY TAG ANOTHER THING HERE WHICH IS CALLED HORMESIS IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PHENOMENON AND IT EFFECTIVELY MEANS THIS THAT THERE IS A DOSAGE OR TOXICITY RESPONSE TO ALMOST EVERYTHING AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IN THE CONSECTS OF SA DRUGS WHAT THIS MEANS IS IF I GAVE YOU TEN MELEGRAMS OF SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD BE OK BUT IF I GAVE YOU TWENTY IT BE A PROBLEM AN EVENTUALLY IF I GO UP AND GIVE YOU ENOUGH THIS THING TURNS TOXIC THIS IS THE CASE OF EVERYTHING FROM SIONIE A WERE IT CAN ACTUALLY BE IN SMALL DHOSAGES AN NATRON FACT ITS IN MANY OF THE FRUITS THAT YOU EAT BUT ITSTHAT A DOSAGE TAT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THAT DOSAGE GETS HIGHER THOUGH THAT ACTUALLY CAUSE PROBLEMS AND IF IT IS HIGH ENOUGH YIU CAN ACT TO KILL YOU IN SAITANOSI THE BACK END O THAT THOUGH IS BECAUSE YOU INTRODUCE THIS MICRO INSULT AS YOU FRAMED IT FOR ME PERFECTLY YOUR BODY WILL HEN ADAPT TO IT ND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH EXERCISED ADAPTATION IS IS IT IS A HORMETIC STRUSSOR AND WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSES TO EXERCISE YOU SEE AN EXTREMELY LARGE INCREASE IN INFLAMMATION YOU SEE OXITATIVE SREST YOU SEE A WHOLE CASCADE OF A TOPHOGY LIKE ALL THESE PROBLEMS QUOTENCO HAPPENN IT'STHAT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE FUNNY HERE IS A AS A PART OF MY PAGE TE THE ACADEMIC PORTION I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE MEDICAL SIDE OF THE SCHOOL AND SO I WAS MY PHYSIOLOGY CLASS WAS IN MEDSCAL OM THE ONLY NON MEDICAL DOCTOR IN THAT CLASS I M A PAGETY SOML I'LL LEAVE MY LAB I WALKCR S CAMPUS IN I TAKE PHYSIOLOGY CLASS OF THESE FOLKS AND II DIE THE WHOLE TIME INTERNALLY BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE WOULD COVER A NEW AREA IT WAS BASELY THE THE EXACT SAME VALOU OR NUMBER AN A MEDICAL SETTING IS LIKE ALL MY GOCH THEY'RE GOING TO DIE AND IN PERFORM OF SETTING IS LIKE THIS PERSONS IN FANTASTIC SHAPE IS THATII NEVER STILL AMUSES ME TO THE STAY OBVIOUSLYCAUSE IT JUST SIMPLE THINGS LIKE TOTAL BLOOD VOLUME RIHTIN YOU COVER LIKE OCAF YOU  HAVE A PATIENT COMMAND THEIR BOOD VOLUME SIX LEADERS MERELY GET HIM ON A DIARETIC OF SOME SORT CAUSE HERE CAN HAVE A HART ATTACK IF BOUT PERCHU GETS UPPER A I'M MERELY THINKIT SIX LEADERS THAT TAT OF PERSONS SUPERFIT CAUS THAT IS ACTUALLY A POSITIVE ADAPTATION TO TRAINING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT ADAPTATION TO NURSE TRAINING IS ENHANCS TOTAL BLOOD VOLUME SO YOUL YOU'LL TORE MORE BLOOD IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU'RE MORE FIT THAN YOU ARE LESS FIT SO I MAKE A GO ON ALL ALL THESE THING SODIUM CONCENTRATIONS BUT ASSIN  CONSCTERTATIONS I LIKE YOU LOOK AT TESE THINGS ON PAPER AND YOUU DON'T KNOW IF THAT PERSONS ABOUT TO DIE CAUSE THERE SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD OUT OF SHAPE OR IF THAT PERSONS CAN T BREAK OOD RECK OR THE MARITHONT THIS BRINGS UP A VERY IMPORTANT TANGION WHICH IS A FOR INSTANCE TIT BE GOAND TAKE A BLOOD TEST AND YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO EXERCISE IS VERY INTENSELY A WITH RESISTANCETRAINING YOUR BLOOD CRATININ LEVELS CAN BE A WAY OUT OF RANGE AND IF YOUR PHYSICIAN DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOUR DOING CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE MIGHT SAY WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF MUSCLE TISSUE DAMAGE OR CURRING IN YOUR BODY YE A AS YOU MENTION BEFORE YOUR TOTAL BLOOD VOLUME IS AS DANGEROUSLY HIGH WHEN IN FACT YOU ARE FAR HEALTHIER IN AND D YOU' MUCH FITTER THAN THE PERSON WHO AS NUMBERS WOULD BE ENRANGED THAT SAID OBVIOUSLY THERE A LIMITS TO THESE TO THESE STATEMENTS WHEREBY YOU WOULD WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS AND TAKE ACTION TO AMELIORATE A VERY ELEVATED A BLOOD GRATENING LEVELER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT THIS IS IS WONE YOUR YOUR A BRINGIG UP IS IS ALSO ONE ABOUT THE FEELD OF MEDICINE WHICH IS THAT MANY NOT ALL BUT MANY PHYSICIANS DON'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION A THE OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING AND SO BECOMES A KIND OF A PLOUGIN PLAY TYPE UN TYPE WAY OF LOOKING AT BLOOD CHARTS YO WE'VE DONE MANY THOUSAND ATHLETES BLOOD CHEMISTRY AND A WE WE DON'T USE FORFIRST WHIL WE NEVER LOOK AT DISEASE STUFF AS NOTALLY DO WE TAKE PEOPLE AT OUR HEALTHY AND TRY TO HOPTOMISES PERFORMANCE AND BLOOD CHEMISTRY IS ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE YOU CAN GET SOME INCREDIBLY POWERFUL INFORMATION OUT OF BLOOD CHEMISTRY WITH THAT RACTURY RELATES TO  IN A TALK TO TO DAY IN TERIMS OF MEASURING YOU EVERYTHING FROM ACUTE TOCHRONIC DEITRATION TO SLEEP DEPROVATION CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN IN BLOOD CHEMISTRY TO OPTIMISATION A IMPROVEMENTS IN NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTATION THERE'S IS THE LOT YOU GET THERE IMEVIF PEOPLE INTERES NOT FEEL THIT WOULD UDPOINT THEM TO A GENTLEMANNAMED DAN GARNER 'S JUST AN ABSOLUTE JARGONOTN WIZARD AND BLOOD CHEMISTRY FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE BUT W YOU CAN GET A TON OF INFORMATION FROM THAT  IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXACTLY WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT LOOKING FOR SIGNALS OF IN C CREASED RISK OF CARTY OF ASKER EVENTS TWENTY FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD VERSES IS THIS THE OPTIMAL VALUE FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE IN AN ATHLEY WHICH IS WHAT OUR OURDATE A BASE IN ALL OF OURSOLF TOORND SUF THOSIS IS ONLY LOOKING FOR THOSE THINGS SO II'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF BILE MARKERS TO LOOK FOR A LITTE BIT LATER AM SALAVARY SOFF SOME BLOODSTUFF I BABLL MAYBE SAVE THAT QURE THE CONVERSATION FOR DOWN THE ROAD TELL ME ABOUT DIFFERENT TIME SCALES ARE RECOVERY SURE THIS IS ACTUALLY WHERE IT WAS TRYING TO ANSWER Y A QUESTION FOR AN THAN I GOT MYSELF WAY OFF TRACK BUT THE REASON I BROUGHT UP THE HERMEDIC THING IS IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SOME THINGS IN THE ACUTE SAY TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY OUR PERIOD LOOK TERRIBLE IT'S ACTUALLY FINE RIGHT SO THIS IS THE STIMULI THAT'S CAUSING ADAPTATION SO THE REASON I BROUGHT UP THE MEDICAL EXCHANGE THERE IS BECAUSE YOU IF YOU LOOKED AT TO FLAMATORY MARKERS DAN N YOU MENTION SOME OF THEM YOU WOULD SEE THAT THEY ARE HIGHEST ACUTE WITHIN SECONDS TO MINUTES TO HOURS AFTER EXERCISE HOWEVER THAT'S EXACTLY THE STIMULI NEEDED TO BRING THEM DOWN CHRONICALLY OKA AND SO CRONICALLY MEANING MAY BE IN THAT MOMENT THEY ARE ELEVATED AND THEY MAYBE THEY'R COMING DOWN TWENTY FOR HOURS LATER AND FORT EIGHT HOURS HOWEVER IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE YOUR RESTING LEVEL SAY THAT MONDAY BEFORE YOU WORK DOWN TO YOUR RESTING LEVEL THAT MONDAY THE WE FOLLOWING WE FOLLOWING THAT WHAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY SEE IS YOUR BASELINE INFLAMMATION GOES DOWN AND SO WE GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL OR WE TALKING IMMEDIATELY POST EXERCISE MAN THESE MARKERS A TERRIBLE MAYBE MY RECOVERY SCORES AWFUL IS SUCH THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING BECAUSE WEWE'RE LUCK LOOKING TO DO IS TO NOT ONLY CHANGE WAS HAPPENING TODAY BUT WE'RE TRYING TO CAUSE ADAPTATION THAT MAY TAKE US WEEKS OR MONTHS TO ACTUALLY ACCESS I LOVE THAT YOUR HIGHLIGHTIN THIS PRINCIPALE BECAUSE ONE OF THEM MORE OBVIOUS ONES TO ME NOW THAT YOU'VE SAID THIS IS HEARTWRAHTE ABSOLUTELYC MY HART RATE GOES VERY VERY HIGH DURING EXERCISE AND I DO THAT FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY OR EVEN SEME CONSISTENTLY AND MY RESTING HEARTRATE WILL ACTUALLY BE QUITE A BIT LOWER THAT'S A FANTASTIC EXAMPLE REALLY WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT HERE IS THIS CONCEPT WHERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ADAPTATION AND OPTIMIZATION NOW WE HEAR THAT WORD AND I USE IT AND MOST SCIENTIST HATEIT BUT IT'S A GOOD COMMUNICATION TO A LOPTIMIZATION IF YOU'RE OPTIMIZING FOR THE CURRENT MOMENT YOU'RE ALMOST SURELY COMPROMISING THE LATE ADAPTATION RIGHT IF IF I ARE TO SAY DO THE THING RIGHT NOW THAT MAKES YOU FEEL THE ABSOLUTE BEST IN THE WORLD AND YOU' LIKE GRIGHT YOU TOOK A NAP AND YET A DOA THE GOSSIM YOU FEEL AMAZING BUT YOU KNO IT'S CAUSING LONG TERMISSIOES THE SAME CAN BE SAID IN THE BACK AND IF YOU'RE NEVER CHOOSING THINGS THAT MAKE YOU BETTER WRIGHT NOW YOU'RE NEVER ACTUALY GOING TO SEE AN APTATION SO WAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING WHAT THIS RECOVERY CONVERSATION IS PLAYING THIS GAME OF BALANCING IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION WITH THE LATE GRATIFICATION AND HOW DO WE IDENTIFY HOW MUCH TO DO NOW VERS IS NOT HOW DO I USE S A VALUE OR A MARKER WHETHER THIS IS HOW TIRED I FEEL TO DAY HOW SORE I AM TO DAY WISS IS A SCORE ON AN AP OR A A TRACKING MATRIC WHETHIS IS A BLOOD MARKER ANYTHING AND UNDERSTAND IF THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO CAUSE THE ADAPTATION I WANT A WEEK A MONTH THREE MONTHS FROM NOW IN THE CASE OF SOME OF OUR OTHER ATHLECS IT'S EVEN UP TO FOUR YEARS RIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO CAUSE ADAPTATIONS THAT WILL GET US WHERE WE WANT TO GET IN T E OLYMPICS OR WEL CHAMPICHIPS OR WORCUP OR WERVER GOING TO BE SO THAT'S THE FRAME WORK WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT RECOVERY WE WE MAY BE FALSELY THINK ABOUT IT IS I NEED TO MAXIMIZE MY RECOVERY TO DAY AND YOU COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE TAKEAN ANTINE FLAMATORY WHETHRIS IS A SUPPLEMENTATION OR A DRUG OR MAYBE THIS IS ICE OH COOL THAT'S GREAT THAT WILL ENHANCE YOUR RECOVERY IN THIS MOMENT THAT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER TO DAY PROBABLY TO MORROW BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT BLOCKS O SIGNAL FOR ADAPTTION SO YOU'RE NOT GET TO GET THE SAME RESULTS IN FOR OR SIX EIGHT WEEKS FROM NOW SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RECOVERY WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TOOL M I USING AND WHY AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AM MY TRAINING FOR AND WHAT AM I TRYING TO MAXIMIZE IF I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A SEASON WITH AN ATHLETE AND WE ARE COMPETING TO MORROW I AM GOING TO HEDGE TOWARDS ACUTE RECOVERY IK AS I HAVE TO TENT ACTUATE THAT PERFORMANCE RIGHT NOW IF I AM STORTING THE OFF SEASON I'M NOT HEDGING TOWARDS RECOVERY I'M ACTUALLY HEDGING TOWARDS ADAPTATION SO R NOT GOING TO DEPLOY ANY OF THESE ESPECIALLY THINGS LIKE THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT A COMBINATION OF VITIMAN SEE INVITE HIM AN E WELL BLUNT I PROTROPHICADAPTATIONS BECAUSE OUR ANTINEFLAMATE WITH ANTI OCCIDENTS RI IOTHER AND OTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE IN EBITORY FACT THEY MAY I MAY NOT POIN IS CONCAPTUALY YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU'R TRYING TO OPTIMIZE FOR AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT FORETHOUGHT AND THAT ALONE IS GOING TO DICTATE YOUR DECISION MAKING WITH WHETHER NOT AGAIN YOU GET IN THE EYE YOU DO THAT NOW WHY WE WILL COVER SOME TOOLS I'M LIKE MISSAGE THAT ARE PRETTY FINE TO USE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE BLOCKING LONG FROMADAPTATION BUT OTHERS YOU GANO ON TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT SO THIS PRINCIPLE THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT FOR US WHICH IS THAT THERE'S A SET OF EVENTS A OCURDURING EXERCISE THA TRIGGER THE ADAPTATION AND THAT SETS IN MOTION A NUMBER OF ADAPTATIONS THAT OCCUR JURING RECOVERY THAT THEN GIVE US THE EXACT OPPOSITE RESPONSE TO WHAT THE TRIGGER WAS EXO 'LL GO BACK TO THE HEARTRATE EXAMPLE AM HEART RATE IS CLOSE TO MAXIM OR MAXIM ALL YOU DO THAT ENOUGH TIMES WITHIN A SHOR YOU KNOW A WEEK OR SO OR TWO WEEKS AND YOUR RESTING HEARTRATE GOES DOWN AS I RECALL A FEW EPISODES AGO YOU SAID THAT YOUR MAXIM OM HEARTRATE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE THAT MUCH IS THAT CRRECT YES BUT YOUR RESTING HEART RATE CAN GO DOWN QUITE A BIT YET IS THAT A GENERAL THEME MEANING DO WE HAVE A E MOR LESS ET UPPER LIMIT OR SEALING FOR THINGS LIKE INFLAMMATORY MARKERS FOR HEARTRATE MAYBE VEN THINGS LIKE STRESS AND WHAT WE DO WHEN WE DELIBERATELY TRIGER STRESS OR AGE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN HEARTRATE OR DRAMATIC INCREASE IN INFLAMMATORY MARKERS IS THAT WE ARE LOWERING THE FLOOR BUT THAT THE SEALING REMAINS THE SAME IT'S VERY DEPENDENT UPON THE MARKER SO IN THE CASE OF MAXIMA HARTRAHT IT WILL NOT CHANGE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE THING WHICH IS AGE AGE BRINGS IT DOWN TRAINING WILL NOT CHANGE IT UP IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE AN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE I SUPPOSE THEORETICALLY TERE IS THE CEILING THOUGH I'M NOT AWARE OF IT A I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT BLOOD MARKERS THE THINGS I CREASE ING KINESS SO REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION ABOUT METABOLISM AND WOULD THAT O WE USE A PHOSSPHOL CREATING AS ONE OF OUR PRIMARY FEEL SOURCES FOR EXPLOSIVE EXERCISE WELL IF WERE USING PHOSSPHEL CREATINE A THIS CREATING KINI SNIM MER EKINIS ARE INSIMES AT THAT FUNCTION TO BREAK THINGS DOWN FOR THE MOST PART SO CREATING KNESS IS THE ENZIME YOU USED TO BREAK DOWN CREATING WHEN YOU DO THAT A LOT THEN THAT CREATING CINES GETS OUT OF MUSCLE AND SEEPS INTO THE LOOD A MILE GLOBIN IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER FANTASTIC MARKER BY THE WAY A MILE GLOBAN IS I TO THINK BUT HEMOGLOBAN BEING IN BLOOD IS OF THE MIL CULE THAT CARRIES OXTION AROUND WHEN IT'S IN THE MUSCLE TISSUE THAN IT'S MILE GLOB AND MILE MEANING MUSCLE AND THE SAME GLOBULANT THING SO THERE'S A MUCH OF MARKERS YOU CAN LOOK AT MUSCLE BREAK DOWN AND ONE OF THINGS T YOU CAN SEE IS A CREATING KINIS LEVEL THAT'S ELEVATED AFTER SAY A ONE BOUT OF EXERCISE AN AND YOU MIGHT T MIGHT BE UP IN FIVE OR SIX FOLD A I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THIS NUMBER IN A OFFENSE OF LIMAN IN THE INOFELL BE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE HUNDRED PLUFS FULD SO EVEN WITHIN JUST ONE CATEGORY TO THE NEXT THAT THAT NUMBER CAN GET EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH AND IF YOU KNOW THIS IS ACUALLY ONE INIS IMPORTANT POINT HERE IF YOU'R PAYING ATTENTION TO ANY MECHANISTIC RESERTHORY USE YOU'RE USING THAT TO INFORM YOUR DECISION MAKING YOU HAVE TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY CAREFUL OF MAGNITUDE AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF IF I WERE TO TO BE RUNNING O A WESTERN BLOT LOOKING AT A SIGNALING PROTINE A INAMUSCLEAS DOES IT TI THIS ACTIVATION OF THIS PROTINE TURN ON MY OCONDRA BILE GENESIS AND I SAW THAT WHATEVER INTERVENTION WE GAVE IT WHETHERE WAS A NUTRICIAN THING OR A DROG OR AN EXERCISE AND I SAW THAT THAT SIGNALING PROACHING INCREASED BY TWENTY PER CENT I WOULD BASELY SOON THOT TO BE TOTALLY PHYSIOLOGICALLY IRRELEVANT BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR THAT TO BE IMPORTANTLY TOTALL DEPENDS THE MARK YOUR LOOKING AT BUT SOME MARKERS I MIGHT NEED TO SEE FOUR OR FIVE SIX HUNDREDFOLD INCREASE BEFORE I KNOW THAT THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE ENOUGH TO BE WHAT WE CALL PHYSIOLOGIC RELEVANT OTHERS IF THEY'RE UP ONE OR TWO PER CENT THAT IS RELEVANT AND SO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE EITHER READING PAPERS OR LOOKING AT SOLCIAR MEEDYA STUFF A PEOPLE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS MARKER INCREASED THIS MUCH IT MAY NOT MATTER IT MAY BE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT PHYSIOLOGICALLY AND SO YOU HAVE TO THAT DOES ALSO IF YOU ONDER LIKE HOW THE HELL OF THE O THESE PEOPLE WELL THAT'S HOW THEY CAN TRICK YOU A LITTLE BIT IN WHAT INTENSIALLY ORE NOT COULD BE JUST THEYRE TRYING WOT THEIR BEST BUT THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT ARE ENOUGH AND SO I'M THAT'S AN IM PORTANT POINT TO BY ATTENTION OF SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AGAIN FULLY IT WOULD BE HARD TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS TRULY A MAXIMUM LEVEL I'M SOMETHINGS DON'T WANT A MOVE LIKE BLOOD PEAGE IT DOESN'T REALLY WANT MOVE THE RANGE THAT YOU CAN MOVE FROM IS YOU LIKE SIX POINT EIGHT O SEVEN POINT FOR AIF YOU GET UP THE LIKE SEVEN POINT NINE LIKE YOURE PROBLPING IN BIG BIG BIG TROUBLE ALTHER THINGS AGAIN CAN GO UP FIVE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSANDFOLD AND SO THE MARKERS WILL REALLY DETERMINE THAT ANSWER WELL THAT'S SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE I LOVE TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION AROUND THE TOPIC OF STRESS SPECIFICALLY YEIM AND MAYBE WE WILL GET INTO THAT LIE BIT LATER TO DAY WHEN WE I'M GET INTO THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY UM HAS EFFECTS RELATED DIRECTLY TO TEMPERATURE ON TISSUE BUT ITS CERTAINLY HAS MENTAL OFFACTS AND TERMS OF RAISING ONE' LEVEL A PERCEIVED PAIN IT'S FUN I IT WERE AS SOME PEOPLE LOVE IT AND SO PEOPLE LOVE IT FOR THE FEELING THEY GET JURING IT I'M DELIBERATE COLL EXPOSURE SOME PEOPLE ONLY LIKE IT FOR THE FEELIG THAT THEY GET AFTER IT NOT UNLIKE EXERCISE TO I I LOVE TO TRAIN I LOVE EXERCISE BUT I KNOW MANY PEOPLE W I'M THEY LODE EXERCISE BUT THEY LOVE THE FEELING AFTERWARD SO THIS WILL BE A THING THAT WE COME BACK TO THANK YOU FOR INDULGING MY INTEREST IN THAT A SEMI TANGET I THINK IT'S ARRELEVANT TANGIENT IF THERE IS SUCH A THING IU COUN NOW RETURN US TO THE DIFFERENT TIME SCALES YEAND MODES OF RECOVERY IS THINK WHERE WE ARE HEADED IS HOW TO GET BETTER AT RECOVERY YET LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS LESS TALK ABOUT WHAT THE MEASURE AND IDENTIFY FOR ALL FOUR OF THESE DISTINCT LEVELS SO LEVEL ONE IS WHAT WE CALL OVERLOAD AND JUST VERY QUICKLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS I DID WORK OUT TO DAY THE SIGN AND SYMPTOM OF OVERLOAD IS YOUR FATIGUE ACUTE PERFORMANCE IS DOWN SO I WORKED OUT HARD RIGHT NOW IF I WERE TO GO TRY TO DO A MAXIMUM EFFORT I WOULD BE REDUCED IN MY ABILITY THE RECOVERY PERIOD FOR A CUTE OVERLOAD IS MINUTES TO DAYS RIGHT THAT'S GENERALLY WE CALL IT CUTE OVERLOOK AND THAT'S WHAT WERELOOKING FOR RIGHT SO WE SYSTEM SHOULD THEORETICALLY SEE THAT HOROMATIC STRESSER COME BACK IN RESPONDS COME BACK BIGGER BETTER MORE EFFICIENT ET CETERA IF YOU WERE TO CONTINUE TRAINING IN THAT STATE LIKE MOST OF US TO AND SAY I DID WORK OUT TODAY I HAVE LE LEBIT OF A CUTE OVERLOAD CAN I WORK OUT AGAIN TO MORROW ATTLE MORE ACUTE OVERLOAD CAN WORK OUT THE NEXT DAY LITTLE MORE ACUTE OVERLOAD EVEN IF YOU TOOK A DAY IN BETWEEN IT THAT DOESN'T MATTER I YOU JUST CONTINUE THESE ACUTE BOUTS OF INSULT THEN YOU CAN N BE PUSHING IN TO THE ABSOLUTE GOLDEN TARGET WHICH IS WHAT WE CALL FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING SO YU HAVE OVERREACHED WHAT YOU CAN CURRENTLY DO AND IT RESULTS IN A FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME AND W T WE MEAN FUNCTINING HERE IS PERFORMANCE IS ENHANCED ND AGAIN PERFORMANCE BEING WHATEVER YOU DEEM IT TO BE YOUR STRONGER YOU'VE AN HANMUSCLESIZE YOUR MATOCONDRY IS IMPROVED YOU WHATEVER THE THING IS IT'S NOT JUST A PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE THING RIGHT AMAZING RECOVERY TIME FOR FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING IS TYPICALLY A FEW DAYS TO MAY BE EVEN A WEEK OR SO AND SO TYPICALLY WHAT WE SEE HAPPAN IS PRIOR TO A COMPETITION INDIVIDUALS WILL DO WHAT WE CALL A TAPER WHICH IS A REDUCE TRAINING VOLUME FOR SOME STHORT APETER TIME AND THE THE REASON THEY DO THAT IS TO AGAIN A ACTUALIZE IS THE PHRASE WE HERE IS HERE THE ADAPTATIONS AND SO YOU WORKED HARD FOR SIX WEEKS AND ING YOU THEORETICALLY THE WORK OUT YOU DID THREE FOUR OR FIVE SIX WEEKS AGO ONCE YOU ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO RECOVER WI'LL BE ACTUALIZED WHICH MEAS YOUR PERFORMANCE WILL BE IN HANDS HERE SO FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING IS THE GOLDEN TARGET IF YOU WERE TO BE AT THE POINT OF FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING AND YOU CONTINUE TO TRAIN SO IT INTENSIFIED WHETHER THIS IS THROUGH INTENSITY THIS THROUGH VOLUME ORE REALLY AS YOU SAID EARLIER YOU HAD SOMETHING HOLDING BACK YOUR RECOVERY IT DOESN'T REALY MATTER RIGHT IT'S S  SORT OF TWO SIDES IN THE SAME POIN  THEN YOU AND MOVE INTO WHAT WE CALL NON FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING SO YOU'VE OVER REACHED AGAIN BUT NOW IT IS NON FUNCTIONAL AS IN YOU DID NOT SEE A POSITIVE BENEFIT ONCE RECOVERY ALOUD THIS TYPICALLY MEANS YOU HAVE WEEKS IT TAKES WEEKS TO COME BACK FROM AND YOU BASELY TISGEPT BACK THE BASELINE AND THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE WHO END UP IN THIS VICIOUS PCYCLE AND SO YOU'RE LIKE MAN I'M NOT GETTING THE RESULTS I WANT I'M GOING TO TRAIN HARDER I'M NOT GETTING RESULTS O ON I'M N TO TRAIN HARD AND HARDER BUT BECAUSE YOU'VE CO OF RECOVERY ISN'T IMPROVED YOU JUST END UP IN THE SAME SPOTS THAN YOU TRAIN MORE AND YOU NAVE THE SANE SPIN YOU END UP THEN JUST EITHER BLOWING UPPER QUITTING ANYOU NOT GETTING WHAT YOU WANT IF YOU WERE TO CONTINUE PAST THAT POINT YOU MAY ACTUALLY BE INTO WHAT WE ACTUALLY CALL OVER TRAINING AND THAT TYPICALLY IS A CONSIDER TO BE OVERTRAINED IF IT TAKES MONTHS TO RECOVER FROM SO MOST PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE OVERTRAINED ARE REALLY NOT YOURE JUS PROBABLY NON FUNCTIONALLY OVERREACHED AND AGAIN T E CLASSIC DISTINCTION IS IF YOU TOOK THREE OR FOUR DAYS OFTEN YOU FELT BETTER YOU WEREN'T PROBABLY QUOTINQUOTE OVERTRAINED YOU ARE PROBABLY JIST IN THIS AREA OF NON FUNCTION OF REACHING Y UNETELIMIT OF A BACKOFF IF YOU IN THIS HAS BEENTHE CASE I'VE HAD THIS HAPPEN WITH GIMNISTS AT A CHELATER AND SOME OTHER THINGS WARE THEY TAKE A MONTH OFF AND WERE BARELY SEEING THE START TO COME BACK TO THEIR BASELINE NUMBERS IN ANY NUMBER OF AREAS MOOD DESIRE TO TRAIN TOSTOSTRONG CORTESAL RATIOS A BOU MARKERS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE FERTICAL JUMPIGE LIKE ALL THESE THINGS THEY JUST START TO GET BACK THE BASELINE SO OVER TRUE OVERTRAINING IS ACTUALLY QUITE RARE NON FUNCTIONAL OVER REACHING IS MUCH MORE COMMON AND AIT IS A SHORTER TIME FOR HIMSELF SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RECOVERY THOSE ARE THE FOUR PIECES THAT WERE REALLY THINKING ABOUT AND SO IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OH I'M SUPERSORE HOW TO I GET LESS OR HOW DO I EITHER NOT BE A SORE NEXT TIME I DO THAT SAME WORK OUT OR I'M SUPERSORI NOW HOW TO I RECOVER THOSE ARE PLAYING IN THAT FIRST CATEGORY OF OVERLOWED AND WE CAN CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT HOW TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT THE QUICK ANSWER IS YOU GOT O GO BACK TO OUR PREVIOUS EPISODES AND JUST PAY ATTENTION O THE VOLUME INTENSITY RECOMMEDATIONS IF YOU'RE GETTING SIGNIFICANTLY A MORE DAMAGE OR FATIGUE IN A WORK OUT YOU PROBABLY HAVE INCREASED YOUR VOLUME TOTOO QUICKLY OR SOMETHING ELSE IS DRAGGING YOUR STRESS BUCKEDOWN BUT GENERALLY THIS IS A PROBLEM OF TRAINING YOU EITHER DIDN'T WARM UP SUFFICIENTLY YOU'RE FUELING STRATEGY IS OFF WHICHWILL TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT EPISODED OR YOU VIOLATED ONE OF OUR PRINCIPLES OF INCREASING INTENSITY IN VOLUME SIR TO QUICKLY I IF IT'S PAST THAT AND YOU'RE GETTING TO A STAGE WHERE YOUE JUST LIKE I'M FEELING BEAT UP ALL THE TIME I ENERGYES GOING DOWN I'VE JUST NOT FEELING LIKE OM RECOVERED NOW WE'RE IN THIS OVERREACHING STAGED SO THE THE STORY I CIN I TELL HERE ALWAYS IS A A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING AND AMY WIFE NATASHA WAS IN THE GROGH TRAINING AND I'M DOING SOMETHING AN LIKE SHE COME STUMBLING AND SHE HAS THIS LOOK ON HER EYES AN THE'R LIKE GANT HER IBALLS OR GIANT SHE SEGUOBBLING AND SHE SIGHT I AFT UP I LIKE WHAT HE MEAN YOU LIKE AT UP AND SHE'S TUSIKT I READ THE PROGRAM WRONG AND SHE'S LIKE TROMIC WHATD YOU DO  LIKE SHE WAS'POST TO BE DOING TEN SETS OF THREE EVERY MINUTE ON THE MINUTE AND SHE DID THREE SUT A TEN EVERY MINUTE ON THE MINUTE AND E IT WAS ABSOLUTELY WRECK SHE COULDN'T MOVE FOR A FEW HOURS AFTERWARDS AND THEN FOR DAYS SHE SUST LIKE YOU HAVE TO HANDLE THE KIDS LIKE I CAN'T GET OUT OF BAT A CANTMO SO THAT WAS AKE HASTIC EXAMPLE OF I RIGHT LIKE WE DON'T NEED TO FIX RECOVERY HERE YOU'RE JUST A DUMMY AND YOU DID THE TRAIING WAY TOO HARD TO LONG LIKE THIS IS NOT WE DN'T HAVE A PROBLEM HERE SO IF IT'S TOCATE A SITUATION LIKE THAT IS GENERALLY YOU JUST THE PROGRAMLESS WAY OFF IIF IT'S CONSTANTLY HAPPENING WHET YOU JUST LIKE MAN FOR WHATEVER REASON EVERY ONE SO WHILE I'M GETTING REALLY SORE OR HAVING A REALLY BAD PERFORMANCE IN THESE WORE ACCOUNTS THEN WE NEED TO GO TO OUR OTHER STRESS BUCKET TAKE A LOOK AT OUR ALISTATIC LODER ALIASIS AND GET FIGET OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE I'M SO THOSE WARE THE THE EASY WAYS TOF FLAG A CUTE OVERLOWED PROBLEMS I LIKE TO SEE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR ATHLETIC GREENS ITH LETIC GREENS IS A VITIMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC AND ADAPTIGEAND DRINK DESIN TO HELP YOU MEET ALL YOUR FOUNDATION OR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIT GREENS DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SO I'M DELIGHTED THAT THER RESPONSOR OF THIS PODCAST THREASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME MEET ALL MY FOUNDATION OR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT COVERS MY VITEMENTS MY MINERALS AND THE PROBITICS ARE ASPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME ITHLETI GREENS ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTIGINS WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR RECOVERING FROM STRESS FROM EXERCISE FROM WORK OR JUST GENERAL LIFE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY IT LET IT GREENS HOU CAN GO TO  LET IT GREN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEYLL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU YEAR SUPPLY OF VITE HIM IN DEE THREE CAT TO AGAIN IF YOU LIKE TO TRY IUT LET IT GREENS GO TO  LET IT GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER I'M HAPPY THAT YOU POINTED OUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING OVER TRAINING AND BEING OVER TRAINED THINK ONE COMMON MISTAKE THAT PEOPLE MAKE HIM THING ABOUT BIOLOGY GENERALLY IS THAT THEY THINK IN TERMS OF NOUNS AND ADJUCTIVES AND NOT VERB SUMMASING I LOVE THAT SO MUCH N BIOLOGY IS A A COLLECTION OF PROCESSES OR PROCESSES DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE IN WHERE YOU LIVE IN WHO YOU TRAINED WITH BEING OVERTRAINED IS A STATE THAT IN MANY WAYS IS AN ADJUTIVE YOUR OVERTRAINED I'M OVERTRAINED I SAYING A YOU KNOW I'M AN AMERICAN O A YOU KNOW CHECKLUSS OF AKIAN WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT AND IN MANY WAYS PEOPLE DO START TO ASSOCIATE WIT AN IDENTITY AT LEAST A TRANSIENT IDENTITY AND THEY START MAKING ALL SORTS OF DECISIONS IT SOUNDS LIKE ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF VERBS THEY WILL AND WILL NOT ENGAGE IN WHEREAS I THINK YIU WE LOOK AT THINGS AS PROCESSES AND WE A SIGN VERBS TO THEM THEN WE CAN SAY OKA I'M FUNCTIONALLY OVERREACHING OR I'M TRULY OVER TRAINING WHICH JUS AS MATTER OF DEGREES IHT OR UNDERTRAINING FOR THAT MATTER I'M NOT I'M REACHING BUT I'M NOT FUNCTIONALLY REACHING IT'S JUST AT' JUST PERFORMANCE AND YOU KNOW JUST AS WITH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WON'T CHANGE UNLES YOU IVE IT A REASON TO THIS THE REASN WY IF YOU CAN PERFORM SOMETHING PERFECTLY OR SPEAK A LANGUAGE PERVECTLY THERE'S THERE'S NO REWIRING OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THIS MITH THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN TOLD THAT EVERY EXPERIENCE REQWIRES YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM ANCE DIFFERENT NOW THAN IT WAS TOO SECONDS TO THAT'S THAT'S A RIDICULOUS ILLOGICAL STATEMEN WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE IF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN PERFORM SOMETHING IT HAS NO REASON TO CHANGE AND IT WON'T MUSCLES THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE TO PROGRESSIVELY OVERLOOED YOUAVE TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW OR CHALLENGE OR MUSCLE TO TO SOMETHING IT'S E SAMETHING SO IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE A WITH YOUR WIFE DOING THIS WORK OUT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE FAR MORE STRANUOUS SHE HAD FUNCTIONALLY OVERREACH IN SOME SENSE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVER TRAINING OR HEADING IN THE DIRECTION OF OVERTRAINING BUT THE MISTAKE WOULD BE TO ASSUME IT SHE WAS OVERTRINED RIGHT AS A KIND O IT'S ALMOST BECOMES A BIT OF A STATE OR A CHARACTER A SIGNMENT AM AS OPPOSE TO A VERB AND IN ANY CASE THERE'S NO PERFECT WAY TOSTRYTHER TO WRETING ABOUT NOWNS AND ADJUCTIVES AND AND WERE ALSO ON A TALKING ABOUT VERBS BUT I THINK THE VERBS ARE REALLY ANCHORED DOWN IN PROCESSES AND THINGS THAT WE DO ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE AND SO OM IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO JUST HIGH LIKE THIS THIS IDEA OF SHIFTING ONE THINKING TOWARDS VERB ACTIONS RATHER THAN LABELS ON THE STATE THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE IN OR THE PERSON THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE ID SOMETIMES IT EVEN DOES BECOME KIND OF CHARACTALOGICAL THE WAY THAT PEOPLE DESCRIBE IT AND A SO I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED OVERTRAINING THAT OVERTRAINING IS REAL ANOTHER WORDS BUT THAT WE DON'T EVER REALLY KNOW IF WE'RE OVER TRAINED YOU NAIL ES THERE'S THERE'S NO YOU NOT'S NOT LIKE A RED FLAG TA YOU KNOW SHOOTS UP OUT O YOUR SHOULDER AND I AM OVERTRAINED YOU KNOW ITS A'M SO IN DOING SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN START THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE VERBS THE ACTIONS THAT WE CAN ALL TAKE IN ORDER TO IN SURE THAT WE STIMULATE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE DON'T FALL INTO THESE BINS OF CHARACTER ASIGNMENT WHERE SUDENLY WE DECIDE THAT WE NEED TO DO ACTS LIKE TAKE A MONTH OFF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE AM FROM OUR DISCUSSION THAT THAT'S EXACTLY THE WRONG WAY TO GO THOSE ARE FANTASTIC POINTS I WON'T WANT TO MAKE SURE IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO CLINICAL DIGNOSES FOR OVERTRAIN THER'RE NO STANDARDS THERE'S NO TEST OR A BLOOD PANNEL YOU CAN PULL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY DENTIFY YOU IN THAT STATE SO YOURE YOURE DISTINCTION HERE ANDREW OF THESE REVERBS AND RATHER THANNOUNCE IS IS SO WONDERFUL ASTHAT IS EXACTLY THE CASE THE ONLY WAY WE COULD REALLY COME RETRACTIVELY DIAGNOS ONE WITH OVERTRAINING AS IF AGAIN WE HAD YOU DID WEEKS OF RECOVERY AND YOU ONLY GOT BACK TO BASE LINE SO WE CAN'T DO IT IN THE MOMENT I CAN'T TAKE A SINGLE TEST THERE'S A SUBJECTIVE MARKER ANYTHINGS AS YOU ARE OVER TRAINED IT IS SIMPLY YOU ARE PROBABLY OVERTRAINING AND WE NEED TO REVERSE THAT QUICKLY OR IN THE CASE OF THE STEP BEFORE YOU ARE PROBABLY FUNCTIONNON FUNCTIONALLY OVERREACHING AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO DO THIS YOU WILL PROBABLY ENTER INTO STAGE I WHERE THIS IS YOU ARE OVERTRAINING AND WE NEED TO COME BACK SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW AS THERE'S NO ONE THING WE CAN ACTUALLY POINT TO THAT SAYS YOU ARE HERE YOU ARE NOT ANNOWN THIS IS A BERB SO WHAT ARE SOME TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO ENHANCE OUR RECOVERY YET LEST START UP WITH THAT ACUTE OVERLOAD FACE SO IN OTHER WORDS I DISTDID A WORK OUT AND I'M FEELING AWFUL OR I DISDID ONE TWO DAYS GON OM SUPERSOLE HOW DO I GET RED THAT RIGHT NOW WHAT IS A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU CAN DO IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOUR WORK OUT AND THEN OTHERS THAT AR MAY BE MORE ACTIONABLE A DAY LATER OR TWO DAYS LATER AND WE'LL DISCOVER HANDFUL THEM WILL DO SOME NETRITION AND I DRATION IN SUPPLEMENTATION IN THE NEXT EPISODE I'M MUN COVERYTHING ELSE NOT IN A CATEGORY RIGHT NOW SO A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHARP KICK START THAT RECOVERY PROCESS AT THE END OF YOUR CURRENT TRAINING SESSION AND I GUESS I SHOULD SAY THIS WAY I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU START THIS RECOVERY PROCESS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WORK OUT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THIS IDEA OF YOU GOT O GET A REALLY HIGH PEAKE OF STRESS TO CAUSE THADAPTATION BUT I ACTUALLY DIDN'T EXPLAIN THAT CORRECTLY CAUSE WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS YOU NEED THAT EXTREMELY HIGH PEAK BUT YOU THEN YOU HAVE TO BE MET WITH AN EXTREMELY SHARP RECOVERY BACK DOW AND SO YOU KNW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE IN SOME OF YOUR A NURL PLASTICITY SUFF AND IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN THE CAUSE THE INSULT AND THEN YOU IMMEDIATELY NEED TO BE ABLE RECOVER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CAUSES CHANGES N RE SAME THING HAPPENS HERE SO WE NEED A REALLY SHARP AND HIGH INFLAMATORY RESPONSE AND THEN IF YOU DO NOT MEET IT WITH AN IMMEDIATE RECOVERY PERIOD THE SIGNAL WON'T BE THERE TO MAX MAS YOUR RESULT SO WHAT'S THAT MEAN YOU CAN JACTUTED YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE IS ACTUALLY LISTENING TO SLOW PACE MUSIC THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST FAST PACE MUSIC ME A SLOW DOWN YOUR RECOVERY AND SLOW PACE WOULD ACTUALLY ANHANDSE IT SO IF YOU JUST TRANGE FROM YOU KNOW YEUR MAXIMUM GET YOU UP AND GET GOING MUSIC DURING THE WORK OUT TO A SLOWER LOWER CADENCE THAT WILL HELP YOU KICK STAR AT THE IDEA OF A SIMILAR NOTE YOU CAN ALSO USE WAT WE CALL DOWN REGULATION BREATHING YOU CAN DO THEM IN CONJUNCTION OR ONE OR THE OTHER WHICHEVER IS UP TO YOU SO MY PERSONAL FAVORITE METHOD HERE IS SOMWHAR BETWEEN THREE TO TEN MINUTES AF FINISHING YOUR TRAINING SESSION LAYING DOWN I LIKE TO BE IN OTPOSITION YOU CAN CERTAINLY DO T IN LODUST POSITION BUT I THINK LAING IN YOUR BACK AS GENERALLY MORE EFFECTIVE PERSONAL PREFERENCE THERE NO SCIENCE I LIKE THE EYES BEING COVERED GETTING INTO THIS DARK QUIET SORT OF AREA AND THEN JUST REATHING THROUGH YOUR NOSE IN A STRUCTURED CADAND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN TRY AN EASY EXAMPLE IS JUST BOX BREATHING SO AND YOU CAN IMAGIN BOX HAVING FOUR SQUARES SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS IN HALE FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN LIKE THREE TO EIGHT SECONDS ND WHATEVER NOW WILL YOU CHOOSE YOU KEEP THAT SAME TEMPLE AND SO LET'S SAY YOU CHOSE TO DO A FIVE SECOND IN HALE THAT'S GONG TO TAKE YOU UP VERTICALLY AND THEN HORIZONTALLY FOR YOUR BOX IS A FIVE SECOND HOLD AND THEN A FIVE SECOND EXT HALE AND THEN A FIVE SECOND HOLD AND YOU JUSTEING TO REPEAT THAT FOR THE TIME DOMAIN I TYPICALLY HONESTY DO'T USE A TIMEOR YOU'LL ACTUALLY NOTICE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL LIKE FALLSELEEP OR GET REALLY CLOSE TO FALLING ASLEEP IN IS PERID AND YOU CAN DO A TRIINGLE VERSION OF THAT WERE YOU YOU AN INHALE HOLD EXHALE ON THE GRIT BACK AN YOUR INHALE OR UP BUT THERE'S A PBONCH TO DIFFERENT TRICKS YOU CAN TRAHERE YOU NEED TO PLAY AROUND AND SEE WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS BEST FOR YOU TEN MINUTES IS PROBABLY BETTER BUT IF YOU CAN JUST AT LEAST GIVE ME THREE A THAT A WORK IF YOU'RE REALLY REALLY RESISTANT YOU CAN ACTULLY DO THAT JUST IN THE SHOWER AND SO IF YOURE CAN AFFISH YOUR WORK OUT GETTN THE SHOWER AGAIN DISCLOSE YOUR EYES IN THE SHOWER GIVE ME THREE MINUTES OF FOLCUST RELAXATION BREATHING AND THAT WILL ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY PROCESS I LOVE IT AND I PARTICULARLY LOVE IT BECAUSE MY LABORATORY WORKS ON STRESS AND RESPIRATION IT YAU BREATHING AND THE INDIRACTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO AND LET US MENTION A RESULT THAT WAS JUST ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION SO SHOULD BE OUT BY TEN TEN STAY SIR IRS A THANK YOU A THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF A NOT MEE DIRECTLY ALTHOUGH IT TOOK PLACE IN MY LABIT AS WE KNOW IT'S THE TUOSTOC ALREALLY YOU THE HEAVY LEFT OING OF A DOCTOR MALISE A BOBON A IN MY LAB A PHENOMENAL RESEARCHER THAT SHOWED THAT A SHORT PERIOD OF FIVE MINUTES OF BOX BREATHING OF EXACTLY THE TYPHTLY YOU DESCRIBED OR A SICLIC SIWGHING SO TWO INHALES FOLLOWED BY AN EXTENDED EXHALE TO LUNGS EMPTY IDEALY THE INHALES OR DONE THROUGH THE NOSE THE EXHALES ARE DONE A THROUGH THE MOUTH ALTHOUGH IT COULD ALL BE DONE THRUGH THE NOSE A OR THE MOUTH FOR THAT MATTER BUT PROBABLY NOS NOS FOR INHALE INHALE MOUTH FOR EXHALE OR A A IN INHALES THROUGH THE NOSE AND AND EXHEL THROUGHTHE NOSE SICLIC SIWGHING AS WE FOR TO DONE FOR FIVE MINUTES BOTH OF THOSE PRODUCE VERY SIGNIFICAT A DECREASE IS IN RESTING HEART WRIGHT THE OVER TIME WILL INCREASE THINGS LIKE HEART RAVERY ABILITY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH A SO PROVIDED THAT THERE ARE EXTENDED EXHALES IT SEEMS LIKE THE CALMING RESPONSE AND THE REDUCTION AND OVER ALL STRESS OF COURSE THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY SENS THINGS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE SYCLIC I PREVENTILATION I'MSURE YOU'VE OBSERVED THAT AM AND INTERESTINGLY A WHEN WE HAD PEOPLE JUST DU FIVE MINUTES OF A MEDITATION WHICH DURING WHICH OF COURSE THEY ARE BREATHING BUT THERE JUST ALLOWING THEIR BREATHING TO PROGRESS HOWEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE IN THAT MOMENT AM OR MOMENTS CROSS THE FIVE MINUTES A THERE WERE REDUCTIONS IN THE SAME SORTS OF MARKERS OF STRESS THAT I DESCRIBE BUT NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AS BREATHING SO I LOVE THE BOX BREATHING TOOL POST WORK OUT AM AND THERE SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES THERE TOO ON I JUST MENTION BUT I THINK PEOPLE GREATLY UNDER ESTIMATE THE POTENCY OF BREATHING FOR SHIFTING ONES NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION AWAY FROM STRESS OR IF ONE WANTS TOWARD MORE ALERTNESS ENTSTRESS ACTY HAVE A CUP OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU ON NOT SOR I THINK THE ODIN TOUL APPRECIATE THIS A HOW LONG WERE THOSE BOXES DOES IT DISUSE RESLECTED GREAT QUESTION SO WE USE THE CARBONDOX I TOLERANCE TEST MAY A IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO DETERMINE HOW LONG THE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE BOX SHOULD BE AND YOU COVER CARBONDOX AT TOLERANCE TEST IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE AND WE CAN PRIDE A LINK TO THAT CLIP AMIN THE SHOW NOTE CAPTIONS BUT AS YOU POINT OUT INVULVES A LONG EXTENDED EXALE TO LUNGS EMPTY AM AND OF COURSE PEOPLE COULD SIT WITH LUNGS EMPTY BUT A THEY HAVE TO ACCURATELY FAITH VARY AS I SAY REPORT HOW LONG IT TOOK THEM TO EMPTY THEIR LUNGS WE USE THAT AS A AS E GAGE TYPICALLY IF IT TAKES IF PEOPLE GO TO LUNGS EMPTY IN TWENTY SECONDS OR LASS I BELIEVE IHAVE TO GO BACK TO THE PAPER AND LOOK BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE A DURATION FOREACH OF THE SIDES OF THE BOXES AS IT WERE WAS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN AM TWO IN THREE SECONDS IF THEY HAD A A SEEAL TWO DISCARRED TIME OF ANYWHERE FROM A TWENTY SECONDS UP TO ABOUT FORTY  FORTY FIVE SECONDS VUSID IT A DESIDES OF THE BOX FER I BELIEVE A BETWEEN FOR AND SIX SECONDS AND THEN FOR PEOPLE LONGER THAN A WHO COULD DISCARD THEIR AIR OVER A PERIOD OF A MINUTE A OR MORE WE USED A A BOX DURATION THAT IS INHALE HOLD EXALE HOLD DURATION OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN I BELIEVE IT WAS A SEVEN OR MAYBE IT WAS EIGHT AND AT'S LONG AS ELEVEN OR TWELVE SECOND YE THOSE ONGAT YOR THAT A FREE DIVER TYPES YOU CAN REALLY DO THIS IM WE'RE REALLY WELL TRAINED OUT FOR THIS SORT OF THING THE BU DON'T CUT ME EXACTLY ON THOSE NUMBERS BUT THAT THE THAT WAS A PROXIMAT THOSE LINE UP EXACTLY WITH WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE SO I BELIEVE IT'S IT'S CON TO BE CLOSE WITHIN SECONDS OF NON IMPORTANT STINCTION IS IT'S CONE T BE CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT'S GREAT AND THAT WAS A IT TOOK THEM WHAT SIX WEEKS WA IS THIS STUDY WAS DONE OVER THE PERIOD OF A MONTH AND THN WHEN THEY WERE SWAPPED INTO A NEW PATTERN OF BREATHING UM CONDITION OR MEDITATION CONDITION AND THIS WAS ALL TUN RUSTEN IN THE NATURAL WORLD AS WE SAY AN THEY WERE WEARING WOOT BANDS THAT WE WERE GETTING HARTRY HARRY VERY BILLY SLEEP DATA SUBJECTIVE DATA ABOUT MOOD AT CETERA SITTA LOT OF MEASURES BUT THIS WAS UM MORE THAN A HUNDRED SUBJECTS OUT IN THE WILD OF LIFE UM AND WE TRY THIS BEST WE COULD TO TRACT LIFE STRASS OF ENDS AND EXERCISE IND THINGS LIKE THAT AT THAT WAS HARDER TO CONTROL OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY REALLY ALL THOSE RESULTS SPEEK TO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING HERE WHICH IS THAT DELIBERATE RESPIRATION THAT INVOLVES CONTROLLED HOLDS AN EXHALES REALLY HAS A DRAMATIC AND VERY IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON REDUCING OUR LEVELS OF STRESS THAT THAT'S WONDERFUL I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL A WITH YOUR FINDINGS AND WHAT'S REALY INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS YOU MENTIONED HOW THE EXHALATION PORTION IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DOWN REGULATION AND THAT'S ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO OUR PREVIOUS IN DURANCE CONVERSATION WHICH IS THAT IN GENERAL AT REST AT NON ALTITUDE INCREASES IN SEAL TOO OR THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR VATILATION AND SO WIT THAT GENERALLY MEANS IS INHALES OR ASSOCIATED WITH AN UP TIC AND SYMPATHETIC STATE AND EXHALES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HA UPTIC OF PARISONTHET EXSTATE  THIS IS GENERALLY WHY FOLKS WILL DO THINGS LIKE EXHALE AND FINISH THAT EXHALE RIGHT BEFORE THEY PERFORM A VERY HIGH PRECISION NOURELOGICAL TAST SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY AIM AT A TARGETS YOU'RE GOING TO EXHALE FULLY AND THEN ALMOST ALWAYS EXECUTE THAT MOVEMENT AT THE END OF THE EXHALE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU IN YOUR HIGHEST PIRI SYMPATHETIC STATE AND LOWEST DRIVE FOR VETILATION I HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL AT YU GESS FOUND OT THERE'S ACTUALLY OTHER DATED THAT POINT TO INDIVIDUALS US PARTICUARY AFTER ENDURANCE TRAINING THAT CAN GET BACK DOWN TO BASE LINE HARTRITE IS GOING TO BE CORRELATED WITH WHO GETS THE MOST ACTUAL RESULT OF THEIR TRAINING SAID THAT IF YOU TAKE A BUNCH OF INDIVIDUALS AND PUT THEM THROUGH AN EN DURANCE TRAINING PROGRAMM IF YOU MEASURE HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN GET BACK DOWN TO BASE LINE AFTER EACH WORK OUT IN GENERAL THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE BETTER AT THAT ARE GOING TO SEE GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE AT THE END OF YOUR SAY FOUR OR SIX OR EIGHT WEEK TRAINING BLOCK AND SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CAUSATION AND CORRELATION THERE THAT WE HAVE TO UNTIME BUT I THINK IT'S ENOUGH TO SAY HEY IF YOU INVEST THESE THREE IN YOUR CASE YOUR YOUR SUDY WAS FIVE MINUTES IT'S O ONLY GOING TO AN HAND'S RECOVERY YOU HAVE A LIKELHOOD OF INCREASING YOU RESULTS FROM YOUR TRAINING AND NOW WE ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS LIKE BEING ABLE TO TRANSITION MORE APPROPRIATELY INTO OUR NEXT TASK GOING TO WORK GOING TO SEE FAMILY WHATEVER THE THING IS AND IT'S IT'S A NICE CLOTHES TO I ASKED YOU TO BE IN A HIGH SYMPATHETIC STATE BODY I ASKED YOU TO PERFORM AND BE INTERSTRESS I GAVE YOU RECOVERY AND NOW ARE READY TO TRANSITION N OUR NEXT THING SO THAT WE DON'T TAKE THAT EXERCISE ENERGY IF YOU WILL INTO OUR NEXT A TASK WHICH MAY ARE MY NOT WANT ME IN A SYMPATHETIC DRIVE STATE SO SOMEBODY IS SORE FOLLOWING YOUR WORK OUT EITHER LOCALLY SORE IN A MUSCLE GROUP A GROUP OF MUSCLES BE IN THE LEGS OR CASTER TORSO MAYBE THEIR WHOLE BODY IN IS SORE AS IT SOMETIMES IS THE CASE WHAT AR SOME TOOLS THAT THEY CAN IMPLEMENT IN ORDER TO ECCELERATE THE I WONT TO CALL MOVING OUT OF THAT SORENESS BY DIS TRLY A AS WE KNOW THE ALLEVIATION OF THE SOREINESS THROUGH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROCESSIES WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO PUSH BACK ON THAT SORENESS AND DISSIPATE IT YET ABSOLUTELY FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT LACKTY THAT'S IS THE RULY IMPORTANTHING THAT WE STILL HERE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IS OYOUR SORE TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATER YOU GOT DO THIS THING TO GET THE LACKTATE OUT OFTHERE AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE METABOLISM A CONVERSATION AND EPISODE THAT THAT IS NOT THE CAUSE A FATIGUE AND IT CERTAINLY NOT THE CAUSE OF SORENESS SO NOT AN ACTIONABLE TIP THERE BUT JUST A PET PEEPE OF MIND WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT THAT I GET IRRITATED SO WE CAN MAYBE IN THAT CONVERSATION IM TRADITIES TOOLS HERE'SWHAT YOU CAN DO YOU CAN ACTI WEAR COMPRESSION GEAR THAT WILL HELP A LITTLE BIT THEREIS A DECENT AM I HAVE EVIDENCE SUGGESTING IF YOU JUST WERE TO YOU KON PUT SOME TIGHT OR FITTING CLOTHES ON LEISURE WEAR OR COMPRESSION GEARE IF YOU HAVE IT A THACK AN ACTUALLY PREVENT A LITTLE BIT OF SORENESS FROM OCCURRING SO IF YOU'RE NTHE CASE OF POOR NATASHA AND YOU REALIZE YOU JUST ON WAY WA WAIG TOO MUCH OR YOU WENT HUNG OUT WITH YER BUT HUNTING FRIEND AN YOU TRAINED WAIG TOO HARD AND YOU REALIZE ALL MY GOODNESS I'AM GOING TO BE VERY SORE HERE YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY PUT ON COMPRESSION GAREN WAY THAT REALLY FOR AS LONG IS POSSIBLE WHAT WOUTD AR SOME EXAMPLES OF COMPRESSION YOURE IAVE SEEN PEOPLE ON AE PLAIN WITH THOSE HIGH HIGH SOCKS EM I MEAN ANYTHING THT YOU WEAR COMPRESSION GEAR FOR BUT YOU DO FOR EXERCISE SO WHETHER THESE ARE JUST A OU COMPRESSION HANDS AND LEGGINGS THE TIGHT FITTING LEGGINGS A WHETHER THIS IS A LONG SLEEVE SHIRT THAT I LIKE A RASH GUARD YOU WOULD WEAR IN GIT TO OR A SURFING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS LONG AS ITS TIGHT FITTING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE THAN THAT YOU CAN WEAR Y I SUPPOSE YOU COULD GET THE SOCKS WOULD BE GRATE BUT ON WE GENERALY JUST TELL OUR ATLETES A THEY PUT ON O LONG SLEEVE COMPRESSION SHIRTS THAT THEY WOULD WEAR FOR THER TRAINING IN AN LONG COMPRESSION A LEGGINGS AND THAT BE FINE CAN PEOPLE APPLY THESE COMPRESSION UN GARB AFTER TRAINING AND STILL GET SOME OF THE POSIVE EFFECTS YET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD BLOCK ADAPTATION THAT MAY BE THE CASE IAM NOT AWARE OF THOSE STUDIES IF THAT HAPPENS BUT I CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THE INFORMATION SUGGESTS IT CAN HANCE A LITTLE BIT OF MUSCLE RECOVERY BUT I DEALLY ONE KNOWS IF THEY ARE ABOUT TO DO A WORK OUT THAT COULD TRIGGER A LOT OF SORENESS YET AND THEN WEARS COMPRESSION GEAR OF SOME SORT TO OFF SET THAT AND IF SO DOES IT HAVE TO BE LOCAL TO THE MUSCLE GROUPS THAT YOUR WORKING ON THE REASON I ASKE ABOUT THE SOCKS IS MY INTERSTAYING THE SOCKS A THET THE COMPRESSION LOSK BE BORE ON THE PLAN IS THAT IT'S GOING TO SHIFT THAT PATTERNS OF BLOOD FLOW NOT JUST IN THE LOWER LEGS BUT ALL OVER THE BODY YE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING OON A FOLKS IT ON THE ACTURAL EXERCISING TISSUE THOUGH ACTUALYTAT THROUGH THE GOOD QUESSION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER OF WHETHER NOT YOU'D N UPER BODY WORK OUT ONLY OR LOWER BODY COMPRESSION GEAR IF THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION IT MAY HAVE BEEN DONE I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL WE JUST TELL PEOPLE LIKE WEAR WERE THE WHOLE THING AS MUCH AS YOUCAN'T IM I ACTUALLY NOT CONCERN THATYOU'R WEARING IT DURING YOUR WORK OUT IT IS SOMETHING YOU COULD PUT ON AFTERWARDS OR EVEN WEAR TIS LITTLA BIT OF COMPRESSION THE OTHER DAY IM WE'VE ACTUALLY DID A REALLY FUN STUDY I COLLABORATED WITH A BILL CRAMER WHOSE A SPORT SCIENTIS OF THE YEAR WORD IS THE BILL CRAMER LORD IF THAT GIVES YOU AN INDICATION AT OF A UNIVERSILY CONNECTICUT AS WELL AS WITH LEE BROWN SO TWO LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT OWORD WINNERS AND WE WE PUT PEOPLE ON A  PLANE IN STORES CONNECTCUT AND FLEW THEM TO CALSAY FLLERS ON SO A CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT AND SOME OF EM GOT TO WEAR COMPRESSION GEAR DURING THE FLIGHT AND OTHERS DID NOT THEN THEY LANDED IN CALIFORNIA DID A TRAINING BOUT PUT HIM BACK ON THE PLANE WENT BACK THE STORES AND THINK THEY D ANOTHER TRAING ABOU WHEN THEY GOT BACK THERE ERE WAS A LOT OF DAT THAT CAME OUT OF THAT PAPER BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT WAS CLEAR IS THE COMPRESSION GROUP WAS EFFECTIVE A AT HANDLING SOME OF THE BLOOD RELATED COAGULATION AND OTHER ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH A LONG FLIGHTS AND PARTICULARLY OUT LIKE PERFORMANCE SO THAT'S ACTUALLY SNEAKY LITTLE INSIDE ER TRICK THAT I'LL USE A LOT WITH PEOPLE A PRETICT WITHOUTHINS HAT ARE TRAVELING IS JUST WHEARE THAT COMPRESSION GEAR ON THE PLANE SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT AND THAT SORT OF WRUNG THAT STUDY TO MIND THAT IT'S ANOTHER EFFECT OF STRATEGY SO COMPRESSION GEAR IN GENERAL AS WELL AS PARTICULARLY ON A PLAN BASTTLY THE TIHDER YOU CAN GET THE BETTER WITHOUT I'LL YEUSLY MAKING YOUR HANDS PURPLE AND BEING UN COMFORTABLE AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO DOESN'T HAVE TOBE OVERLY TIGHT A ANYTHING WILL WORK AN IN PROBABLY HOLP SO I'M ALSO DOING THAT PERSONALLY ANY TIME ON TAKING A PLIGHT LIKE THAT AS MUCH AS I CAN IT' JUST TO FEEL A LITTLE BETTER WHEN I GET THERE SO WHAT AR SOME OTHER METHODS THAT WE CAN USE TO ALLEVIATE ACUTE SORENESS WELL IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THE SAME THEME WHICH IS SAYING OKIT WE USE SOME SORT OF PRESSURE MANIPULATION TO ANHANDS RECOVERY IF COMPRESSION IS ONE STRATEGY YOU CAN ALSO USE THINGS LIKE AM COMPRESSION BOOTS OR GARMENTS IN THESE RE NEUMATIC DEVICES THAT WILL O PUMP A AIR OUTSIDE YOU IN COMPRESS I BACKAPORD THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT WILL DO THIS I'M YOUCEN ALSO USE THE PHYSICAL HAND SO THIS WOULD BE MASSOGE AND BODY WOR 'M THE R REALLY WORKING AS BEST WE COULD TELL ON THE SAME MECHANISMS WHICH YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY MOVING FLUID IN AND OUT OF THE TISSUE AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY ENHANCING BLOOD FLOW I INCREASE IN CAPITLARIZATION AND WHICH IS GOING TO ONLY GET NEW TRANS IN AND WASTE PRODUCTS OUT SO YOU CAN KIND OF PICONCHUSE PASED UPON YOUR BUDGET A PREFERENCE IS OF AILABILITY TIMING THINGS LIKE THAT SO THOSE ARE ALL A EFFECT OF STRATEGIES OUTSIDE OF THAT REALLY IS THE NEXT LARGEST CATEGORY WHICH IS NOW THERMAL AND A SO FAR IN THIS DISCUSSION WE'VE MENTION COLD WATER MMERSION AND I TALKED ABOUT IN THE HYPERTRY SECTION HOW YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO DO THAT IMMEDIATELY POST EXERCISE WHICH WOULD BE GETTING INTO COLD WATER OR AN ICE PATH IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GROW MUSCLE MASS HAVING SAID THAT THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT COLD WATER IMERSION SPECIFICALLY IS EFFACTIVE AT REDUCING MUSCLE SORENESS SO IT IS A FAIR CONSIDERATION AND IT'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF HOW THERE ARE NO FREE PASSES AND PHYSIOLOGY NOTHING IS ALWAYS GOOD OR ALWAYS BAT IT'SALWAYS ABOUT WHAT HE WILLING TO GIVE UP WHENFIRSES WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO GET AND THE CASEOF LIKE COLD WATER IMMERSION YOU MAY BE THINKING YET I MIGHT BLUNT SOME HYPROTROPHIC AAPTATIONS BUT IF YOU'RE IN THAT FASE OF TRAINING WHEREYOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO PUSH MORE TOWARDS OPTIMIZATION IN THAT MOMENT RATHER THAN LONG FROM ATAPTATION THEN A AN ICE PATH MIGHT BE A GREAT CHOICE IN ADICTION IF YOU FALL INTO A INARIA LIKE NATASIA DID AND YOU REALIZE LIKE I'M JUST SO UNBELIEVABLY SOER THIS MIGHT COST ME THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX DAYS OF TRAINING IT MIGHT BE WORTH IT FOR YOU TO ECCELERATE THAT RECOVERY PROCESS BY A COUPLE OF DAYS SO THAT YOU DON'T MISS SO MUCH TRAINING SO IS IT'S JUST A IT'S AN OU RYTHM IT'S AN EQUATION WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR I GET IF I'M IN SEASON OR TRYING TO COMPETE OR IF I HAVE JUST DONE WAY WA WAY TO MUCH EXERCISE AND I'M REALLY INSIGNIFICANT PAIN YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO GIVE UP SOME SMALL PERCENTAGE OF EVENTUAL MUSTLE GROWTH AFTER A SINGLE SESSION TO GET OUT OF PAIN SO I'M OF THE COLD STRATEGIES COLD WATER IMMERSION IS CLEARLY THE BEST APPROACH RATHER THAN COLD AIR OR SOME OTHER TACTIC SO A COLD SHOWER IS PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH HERE YOU REALLY DO A WANT TO BE EITHER IN MODERATELY COLD THIS IS MAY BE FORTY TO FIFTY DEGREE WATER A FOR PROBABLY NORTH OF FIFTEEN MINUTES OR YOU CAN BE IN SUBFORTY FOR AS LITTLE AS MAY BE FVE MINUTES TO GET SOME THE FECT TER AND THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES I'M SOME SORT OF SUMMARISING AMUNH T THAT KIND OF INTO ONE RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THEM POINT MY POINT THE NUMBERS YOU JUST THROUGHOUT A WHICH I'M ASSUMING ER A A FAIRENHEIGHT A SEEM SEEM REALLY COLD TO ME M UNCOMFORTABLY COLD AV ABSOLUTLY O I ALWAYS RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE EASEN TO IT AS A PRO TO CALL OVER ALL THAT THEY NOT IMMEDIATELY GO TO THIRTY FIVE DEGREE A COLD WATER IFTHEY'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE A THAT SAID ONCE PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE BEING UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE I ALWAYS ANSWERED THE QUESTION HOW COLD SHOULD IT BE EXACTLY WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT HOULD BE VERY VERY COLD SO MUCH SO THAT YOU REALLY REALLY WANT TO GET OUT BUT THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO STAY AND SAFELY WHATEVER THAT VALUE HAPPENS TO BE YOU HABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE SAVE HAVING SAID THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY IN OUR EXPT RETREATS BPUT DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OF THIS POINT A IMMEALLY IN THE SUB THIRTY FIVE DEGRY WATER THEIR FIRST TIME EVER AND DONE IN A THREE MINUTES MULTIBLE ROUNDS I AN A SESSION SO THEY CAN HANDLE IT BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO GO THAT CRAZY IF YOU DON'T WANT YOU CAN'T HAVE TO PLAY AGAME RIGHT YOUOU WANTO BE REALLY REALLY COLD FOR A SHORT AMON OF TIME OR YOUWAN TO BE LIKE KIND OF COLD FOR A LONGER AM OUT A TIME REALLY THE ONLY MISTAKE YOU CAN MAKE AS DOING SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW SIXTY FIVE DRRY WATER WHICH FOR TO MOST PEOPLE IS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE AND DOING YOUR FIVE OR TEN MINUTES  NOT CAN BE ITS PROBIN NOT CAN BE EFFECTIVE SO IF YOUR LIKE MAN THIRTY FIVE IS IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY AND YOU WNT TO DO FIFTY FIVE DEGREE WATER AND THERE'S LITERATURE IN THAT AREA BUT IT'S GOING TO SAY YOU NEED TO PROBABLY BE THERE SOME WERE ALMOST SURELY NORTH OF TEN MINUTES AND SOME OF IT WILL ACTUALL SHOW YOU NED TO BE TERE LIKE WELL NORTH OF TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTE SO FOR MY MONEY I WOULD RATHER GO REALLY REALTHE COLD AND ET T DONE IN FIVE MINUTES BUT A PERSONAL PREFERENCE ON THIS ONE YOU CAN ALSO MAKE IT LITTLE BE EASIER ON YOURSELF THERE IS NOT NEARLY AS MUCH EVIDENCE BUT THERE IS SOM ON CONTRAST SUFF SO ITHIS IS WHEN YOU GO COLD HOT SORT OF BACK AND FORTH THERE ARE NO REALLY GOOD RULES AND TERMS OF HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU GO HOW MANY ROUNDS HOW LONG AND COLD HOW LONG AND HOT AGAN THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF STUDIES BUT IN OBVIOUSLY THOSE STUDIES USE NUMBERS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THOSE THAV BEEN TESTED TO SEE WITH WHAT ARE OPTIMAL WHICH IS A VERY BIG DIFFERENT SO YOU CAN REALLY JUST COND OF PLAY THAT BY FEELD HOT IS GOOD FOR RECOVERY YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE YOUR ARE GOING TO PUT MORE BLOOD FLOAT IN THE AREA AND SO YOUYOU MAY WALK OUT OF THERE WITH SOME ADDITIONAL ACUTE SWELLING WHICH IS IN GOING TO PUT GREATER PRESSURE ON THERE SO YOU HAVE TO CONTO PLAY WITH I PERSONALLY REALLY LIKE HOT FOR RECOVERY I WILL FEEL MAY BE NOT GREAT IN THAT MOMENT BUT THE NEXT DAY I TEND TO FEEL REALY REALLY GOOD IN ADDITION IF I WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND IREALLY REALLY HURTING AND AND I'M SUPERSTIFF A HOT BATH WILL WILL HELP THAT IM QUITE A BIT SO YOU CAN PLAY WITH SOME OF THOSE PROTOCALLS CAN YOU NO'T HAVE TO DO ICE THERE IS OBSIY NO REQUIREMENT TO DO SO IT IS JUST AN OPTION IF YOU ARE INTERESTED THE STUDIES OF DOCTORSISAN A SOBER'SURE YEARE NOT DIRECTLY AIMED AT ALLEVIATING SORTNESS OR RECOVERY THERE MORE ABOUT INCREASING FERMAL CAPACITY I A STORAGE OF A BROWN OUT OPOSE TISSUE NOT THE BLUVERY FAT BUT THE STUFF AROUND THE CLAVICALS AND AROUND THE HEART THAT HELP YOU GENERATE BODY HEAT AT RAST AN METABOLISM AND SOON AND THE NUMBERS THERE THAT AM SHE'S COME UP WITH AGAIN HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED AGAINST ALL THE POSSIBLE DERIBATIONS JUST LIKE WOULD BREATHING WE DID FIVE MINUTE SESSIONS BUT WHO KNOWS MAY BE A MINUTE WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY AFFECTIVEWE JUST THERERE CONSTRAINTS ONLY SORTS OF STUDIES BUT THE VALUES THAT SHES COME UP WITH WHICH SEEM TO BE GOOD THRESHOLDS FOR MAKING SURE THAT AN ADAPTATION RESPONSE IS TRIGGERED BY HEAT AND COLD IS IT ENDS OF BEING FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES PER WEAK TOTAL OF UNCOMFORTABLE BUT SAFE HEAT AN THAT CASE SONA AND THAT CAN BE ALL IN ONE SESSION OR BREAKING IT UP INTO COUPLE OF SESSIONS ON THE SAME DAY OR OR DIFFERENT DAYS AND THEN ELEVEN MINUTES PER WEEK OF COLD EITHER IN ONE SINGLE SESSION OR MULTIBLE SEIONS AGAIN ONE COULD DO MORE AM ONE COULD BREAK THAT UP OVER WE UN A MULTIPLE DAYS OR DO IT ALL IN ONE DAY OR DO IT ALL IN ONE YOU AN HOUR IN THE SAWN AND THAN ELEVEN MINUTES IN THE COLDER VICE FIRST ALTHOUGH THAT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT EXTREME ESPECIALLY FOR THE UNINITIATED BUT THOSE OF THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED BUT AS YOU POINT OUT THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF REALLY THOROUGH STUDIES EXAMINING DIFFERENT COLD PROTOCALLS ACCORDING TO TEMPERATURE BY TIME REQUIREMENT SO THERE IS A BIT OF SUBJECTIVE FEEL REQUIRE TO ESTABLISH AR ROUTINE ANDOW WOULDAC TO SAY THIS IS ANOTHER TIME TO RE EMPHASIZE SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR CONVERSATION WHICH IS THAT PAIN ITSELF IS NOT A DEFINED OUTCOME I IT'S HEAVILY INFLUENCE BY YOUR PERCEPTION AND SO IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY WORK FOR YOU THEY WON'T WORK IF YOU FEEL LIKE THEY WORK FANTASTIC THEY DO SO IT'S A CHALLENGING FIELD TO GET REALLY OBJECTIVE DATA ON SO THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF SUBJECTIVE NATURE TO SOMEBODYS THINGS I CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY WE'VE USED HOT IN COL CONTRASTS FOR LONG TIME AT LEAS I'M SOME LOF IT SOM DON'T CARE FOR AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WORE I NEVER MANDATED I COURSE I CAN'T MANDAN ANYTHING FOR I M I WORK WITH BUT I'M NEVER Y EY RE INTERESTED GREAT YOU STRUGGLING THIS ARADE OU ON'T TRY THIS YOU DID AND YOU LIKE IT GREAT YOU STRUGGLING IN THIS AREA AND YOU TRY AT YOU DIDN'T LOVE IT OOK AT FINE I'M NOT WELL WE'LL FIND OTHER ROUTES A AS WE WE'LL GET INTO THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO AN HAND'S RECOVERY THIS IS ONLY ONE AND IT HASN'T EVEN REALLY COME DOWN TO STOPPING THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE WORE NET WE'RE JUST TREATING SYMPTOMS WHICH IS FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO GO BACK AND FICK OUT WHY IT'S HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH US A SOLUTION THESE ARE JUST DIFFERENT I AN ACUTE SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT TECTICS ONE FINAL POINT ABOUT A DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I THINK WORTH MENTIONING IS ONE OF THE REASONS THE SHOWER IS EFFECTIVE BUT NOT NEARLY AS EFFECTIVE AS COLD WATER IMERSION OR IMMERSION AND ICE UP TO THE NECK IS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE REASON YOU STAYED BEFORE WHICH IS THAT MOST SHOWERS ARE NOT GOING TO GET THAT COLD AND I CAN GET DOWN YOU KNOW INTO THE SUBFORTIES A ALSO COL SHOWERS HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN STUDYD THAT MUCH THEY HAVE BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS IMMERSION AND YALAYS ASS WY I JUST THNK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF STUDYING COLD WATER A EXPOSURE IN THE SHOWER WHERE YOU CAN'T REALLY CONTROL FOR THING OF HOW MUCH OF THE BODY IS COVERED WITH NOT THE HEAD STAYS UNDER DIFFERENT SIZE BODIES ET CETERA WHEREAS WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO ELABORATORY THEY CAN GET INTO COLD WARCH AND WE KNOW WHERE THE NECK IS WE KNOW WHERE THE CHIN IS AND WE CAN MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE'S ARMS AND UM LEGS ARE UNDERNEATH BUT WITH COLD SH OWER SURE YOU CAN MAKE EVERYONE FACE AWAY OR TOWARD THE SHOWER BUT IT'S REALLY TRICKY AND UM FOR ALL THE VARIATIONS THAT THAT WERE DESCRIBED THAT SET WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IF ONE WANTS TO USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THAT COLD SHOWER IS BETTER THAN NOTHING AND COLD IMMERSIAN IN CIRCULATING COLD WATER OR ICE BATH IS BETTER THAN UM THAN COLD SHOWER YE WHAT OUT ACT YOU SAY IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR RECOVERY FROM MUSCLE SORENESS I WOULD SAY COLD SHOWER IS PROBABLY DOING VERY LITTLE IBECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BEALD TO GET ENOUGH COLD WATER ON TO ANY MUSCLE BESIDES BASEC YOUR HEAD SO MAYBE YOU COULD TRY COLD BATH AND SO YOU LEAST GET SOME SURFACE AREA COVERAGE BE IF YOU WANT TO USE COLD SHOWER FOR ALL THE OTHER OWESOME REASONS TE COLD SHOWER THAT'S TOTALLY GREAT BUT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO USE THAT TO RECOVER YOUR LOW BACK IN CLUDES FROM BEING SORE FROM TRAINING IN A GOOD WAY 'SPROBING I CAN TO DO MUCH O THA THE MERSHN WOULD BE THER YOU ACTUALLY ALSO HAVE SNEAKY OTHER POINT WHICH IS IF YOU CAN'T GET YOUR WATER SUPER COLD JUST MAKE THE WATER MOVE SOIF YOU HAVE JETS AND STUFF YOU CULD TURN ON ANY ONE IS TRY THIS FEUR LIKE ALKYY A I CAN DO A FORTY DEGREE BATH OSSOM I TRY SIXTY WHEN THE WATER'S MOVING I BECAUSE YOU BREAK UP THE THERMAL LAY OR NORMALLY OF A LITTLE THIN LAYER YAV WATER THA YOUR HEATING UP YOU BREAK THAT IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD YET ABSOLUTELY SO BEING VERY STILL IN THE COLD WATER IS ACTUALLY THE WEAKER WAY TO GO  THAT YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FACE STOIC BUT MAKE YOUR BODY CIRCULATE A SOME WATER ROUND YOU  AS LONG AS WE'RE ON THIS A  MAY BE JUST ONE MORE POINT ABOUT HEAT A I'VE CERTAINLY USANA WETSONA DRYSANA ESTEEMSANA SANAS EXCUSE ME JUCUSES CAN WORK PRETTY WELL YET UM A MALS IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO CONCEIVE IN THE SIXTY DAYS FOLLOWING  A SO SOP FALLING SANA OR UM HOT TUB DO DO REALIZE THAT IT THAT BOTH THOSE APPROACHES DO SEVERELY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF MOTILE SPERM I'M SUBSTANTIALLY SO FOR BEAL THAT ARE NOT TRYING TO CONCEIVE I DON'T THINK THAT THIS WORKS A RELIVELY ENOUGH THAT YOU COULD USE AS A FORM OF CONTRACEPTION YET BUT BUT FOR A PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE IT REALLY IS DETRIMENTAL TE TO SPERM HEALTH RIGHT AND SO FOR THAT REASON SOMEP YOU WILL BRING AN ICE PACK AND PUT IT ON THE GROWING OR NEAR THE GROWING EL WHEN THEY GO IN BUT UM WHICH IS HARD TO DO IN A HOT TUB THEN ASANA SO HERE WE'RE GETTING INTO THE FINE POINTS UM OR A SRUWDE POINTS IF YOU WILL UPON INTENDED BUT UM BUT THE IDEAS THAT WE WE WOULN'T WANT ANY ONE TO APPROACH THESE TECHNIQUES AND COMPROMISE THEIR OTHER LIFE GOALS I WAS ERTAINLY NOT ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR THESE THINGS WHAN I WE WERE AT THAT STAGE OF LIFE ILLOWED TO SAY MATASHA PUT AN AXNA ON ME HANGING OUT LAIRD N GO YET IN THE SAN OUT FOR THOSE RATE SUS LIKE YOAUR NOT GOING AND YOU'R NOT GOING NONT A STUFF EN I TO SENT AWAY RIGHT HEAT UM HEAT AND SPERM HAVE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP IT IS NOT WHEN THIT'S POSITIVE FOR THE SITER I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKER IS A PERSONALIZED NUTRITIAN PLATFORM THAT ANALIZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD INDIAN E TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTH GOALS I'VE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE IMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND WELL BEING CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TEST ONE ISSUE WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TESTANDYANATEUS OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT VARIOUS LEVELS OF LIPIDS AND HORMONES AN METABOLIC FACTORS ET CETERA BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION INSIDE TRACKOR MAKES KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION EXCEEDINGLY EASY THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT LETS YOU SEE WHAT YOURSIPMES OIC NUMBERS ARE OF COURSE BUT THEN ALSO WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIOUR OLD DUWS AND DONTS WHAT SORTS OF NUTRITIONAL CHANGES WHAT SORTS OF SUPPLEMENTATION WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BRING THOSE LEVELS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMAL FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE TO TRY INSIDE TRACTOR YOU CAN VISIT INSIDE TRACKOR DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER SCENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACTORS PLANS AGAIN THAT INSIDE TRACKOR DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ARE THERE WAYS TO COMBINE A THE VARIOUS TYPES OF O'M STIMULAE THAT YOU DESCRIBED FOR INDUCING RECOVERY YOU TALKED ABOUT BREATHING BASE TOOLS A WHICH WHILE THEY COULD ADJUST AND INDEED DO ADJUST OXYGEN AND CARMODOXIDE RATIOS AND ET CETERA I'M GESSING THE MAJOR EFFACT OF THOSE ON RECOVERY IS GOING TO BE NURL IT'S GOING TO BE DELIBERATE CALMING OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IT MORE SYMPATHETIC BASE A THE NABSUMENTION YET MOST E AND THEN YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME MOVEMENT BASE AND TOUCH BASED APPROACH IS AM WHICH WILL A MOVEMENT CERTAINLY CERTAINLY WILL CIRCULATE BLOOD BUT ALSO WILL GENERATE CONTRACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES  I WHICH MAY BE IF INDEED AGAINST STILL SPECULATION IF INDEED SOME OF THE SORTNESS IS DUE TO EXEXCESSIVE STRACURE SWELLING AT THE STRETCH ENDS OF THE OF THE MUSCLES THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE SOME MOVEMENT IN TOUCH AND THEN THERMAL ARE THERE WAYS TO COMBINE THESE AMTHAT AARE MORE EFFECTIVOR MAY BE VEN SYNERGISTIC YE I SUPPOSE YOU COULD THROW ON A SOME COMPRESSION GARMENT PUT ON A NEUMATIC COMPRESSION DEVICE AND SIT NESONA WIL YOU DOWN REGULATE YOUR BREATH LIKE THAT WHAT WOULD BE FINE QUITE ONESTLY TOUGH YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED TOMACIMISES ALL OF THEM WE WERE JOKING YOU COULD PROBABLY GO FOR A LIGHT SWIM WHILE REGULATING YOUR BREATHING AND COLD WATER YOU GET THE COMPRESSION FROM THE COLD WATER AND AND YOU'D BE IN A GOOD SPOT SO YOU YOU CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT THE REALIT IS I GENERALLY LOOK FOR SOME PHYSICAL APPROACH AND THEN SOME A WHOLEISTIC APPROACH OF THE BREATH WORK BASE SOME ONT BREATH AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU KNOCK THOSE TWO THINGS OUT YOU'RE NA GOOD SPOT SO THAT COULD BE BREATH WHILE YOU'RE IN THERMOSTRESS SO JUS CONTROLLING AN DOING THE ON REGULAION UP YOU HAVE TO ALSO REMEMBER ICE IS A STRESSER NO'LL ACTULLY SHOW YOU SOME DATA HERE IN A SECOND ABOUT HOW THAT ACTUALLY CAN IN HANDS A SYSTEMIC RECOVERY ALTHOUGH IT WON'T HAPPEN IN ME IN THE ACCUTEMENTS IN FACT THAT'SCONG TO TAKE AT LEAST THIRTY O SIXTY MINUTES AND THEN YOU'LL VENTU TO SEE A REBOUND EFFECT BUT ACUTELY IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU ACTUL MORE SYMPATHETIC WHICH IS GOING TO THE DIRECTION I HE CAN DO THE OPPOSITE OR IT CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE YOU UP SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DEPENDENT UPON HOW YOU RESPOND WHAT TI'ME A DAY A AND HOW YOU'RE USING SO IN GENERAL I GUESS A COMBINING THEM IS IF YOU NEED IT A DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU HAVE WHAT'S AVAILABLE SO PERHAPS YOU DON'T HAVE USON A BUT YOU CAN TICKE A HOT BATH GREAT MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME PRECUSTION DEVICE SOME TOOL AND YOU CAN USE THAT BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A ASONA AMAZING DON'T HAVE ICE BATHLY THING SO I THINK RATHER THAN THINKING ABOUT AN OPTIBLE COMBINATION OF THEM I WOULD SAY DIS USE A COUPLE OF THE TACTIC SPACE ON WHAT YOU HAVE AND WHAT IS EASILY AVAILABLE A IN YOUR SITUATION I LOOVE FOR YOU TI TUCH US ABOUT SOME OF THE METHODS FOR LONGER FORM RECOVERY AS IT RELATES TO OVER REACHING AND OVERTRAINING SHORT YOU WON'T THINK ABOUT THOSE AN A COUPLE OF FACES FACE ONE IS TO TRY TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING THE FIRST PLACE IN TERMS OF TRAINING LOAD YOU CAN A JUST GO BACK TO OUR PREVIOUS EPISODES WHER WE TALK GIVE YOU SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW MUCH TO INCREASE YOUR VOLUME AND INTENSITY FOR WEEK ET CETERA THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO THEN IS DO SOME MONITERING AND I'LL I'LL GO OVER SOME DIFFERENT TOOLS SOME COST FREE ONES AS WELL AS SOME SME HIHER TECT E LOGICALLY DEMANDING ONES AND TO MONOR TO SEEVE ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND THEN THE THIRD APPROACH HERE IS WHAT OF THIS IS ALREADY OCCURRED I FIGURE IT OUT ON SO HOW DO I GET BACK OUT OF THAT HOLE SO I WOULD IKE TO JUST SORT OF TACLIES ONE BY ONE IN ORDER AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT TOOLS YOU CAN USE AND WHYD I'RE GOING TO WORK OR IS ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FATIGUE MANAGEMENT HERE MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THESE TERMS BECASE IF YOU HVE ANY SORT OF TECHNOLOGY A YOU'RE PROBABLY GETTING SOME SORT OF READINESS SCORE OR RECOVERY SCORE OR STRAIN DEPENDING ON WHICH AP OR WATCH OR TECT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF INACULAR CHANGE IF YOU'REIN THE SPORT PERFORMANCE WORLD YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THINGS AGAIN LIKE LOAD OR A GEPIOUS TRACKING IN MONERING IN REALLY ALL OF IT IS IS DOING THE SAME THING IT'S TRYING TO EITHER ONE PREDICT A PROBLEM I'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE FUTURE AND THEN PLACING RESTRUCTIONS UPON YOU SO THAT YOU DON'T RUN IN THAT SITUATIONTHE OTHER THING IT'S POSSIBLY DOING IS IDENTIFYING A DROP IN PHYSIOLOGY OR PERFORMANCE AND THEN SAYING WE NEED TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS HOLE THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SO WHEN WE THINK OF THE FIRST ONE JUST IMAGINE A ASENARIO LIKE A MILEGE LIMITATION A PITCH COUNT AND BASEBALL AND WHAT WA'S HAPPENED THERE IS IS INDIVIDUALS MOSFIELDS HAVE LOOKED AND SAID HAY WHAT WE NOTICE IS PEOPLE WHO THROW SAY MORE THAN A HUNDRED PITCHES IN A GAME TENDENTSTART LOSING EFFECTIVENESS AND INCREASE INDURY RATE THEREFORE WE'RE PREDICTING THE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO PLAY IF YOU CROSS THAT THRESHOLD WE START HAVE ANY INCREASE RISK OF NEGATIVE A CONSEQUENCES SO THEREFORE WE'RE GOING TO CAP YOURE IN THIS CASE PITCHING VOLUME AT THAT HUNDRED PITCHES BR GAME OR WHATEVER THE SAME THING WITH RUNNING ET CETERA CETERA SO YOU CAN SIMPLY DO THAT AND THRE'S ACTUALLY REALLY COOL DATA COMING OUT NOW ON SPORT PERFORMANC STUFF LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE I AM USE IN GU PIAS TRACKERS AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY EVEN POSITION BY POSITION SPECIFIC A RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW MUCH DISTANCE YOU SHOULD TRO COVER AND A PRACTICE IN A TRAINING SESSION I'M SO THAT YOU CAN SAY HAY THESE POSITIONS DON'T CROSS THIS THRESHOLD THESE PHYSICIONS ON CROSS THIS THRESHOLD IN BASKOF ALL AND TANNIS AND AND ALL KINDS OF THNGS LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT PROBABLY EXTREMELY APPLICABLE TO MANY OF THE LISTENERS RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS STILL CONVEYING THE IDEA THAT IF WE UNDERSTAND WHERE WE BREAK THEN WE CAN STOP OURSELVES FROM GETTNG THERE INTHE FIRST PLACE THE FUNCTIONAL EXAMPLE A HERE IS JUST THINKING ABOUT BASIC THINGS LIKE WHERE I START MY TRAINING PROGRAM NTHEN HOW DO I PROGRESS IT AND WE'VE ALWAY COVERED THOSE NUMBERS IN EITHER CASE THOUGH YOU WANT TO HAVE THREE MARKERS THAT YOU'RE PAYING INTENTION TO IF YOU'RE CONCERNED YOU'RE GETTING INTO AN OVER REACHING PHASE OR POTENTIALLY GOING O LEAD TO OVERTRAINING OR YOU ANT TO GET OUT IS THREE UNIQUE THINGS NUMBER ONE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR SOME SORT OF PERFORMANCE AFTERIC RIGHT SO THIS COULD BE IM YOU'RE TIMES ARE GOING DOWN YE YOU'RE SQUAT NUMBERS YOU'RE YOUR POWER IS GOING DOWN ANY THESE THING SO IT'S GOT TO BE IN ACTUAL PERFORMANCE NUMBER TWO SOME SORT OF PHYSIOLOGY AND SO I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPENING WITH RESTING HEART RAT SOME BILE MARKER IS MOVING A HURRY VARIABILITY A SOME OTHER MEASURE THAT IS NOT INFLUENCE BY YOU AND THE BEAUTY OF USING BIOLOGICAL MARKERS ARE IF WE CONTRAST THAT LIKE PERFORMANCE ND I SAID O CASE HERE'S OUR PERFORMANCE UST EVERY DAY YOU COME IN YOU GTING TO A VERTICAL JUMP AND IF ONE DAY YOU COME IN I'LL SEN YOUR VERTICAL JUMP AS SUPERLOLL I'M I THINK UL MAN MAYBE WE'RE STARTING TO OVERREACH YOU ALSO COULD BE FEELING LAZY THAT DAY AND THIS NOT OF JUMP VERY HIGH ON PURPOSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WORK OUT THE BEAUTY OF BILE MARKERS ARE YOU DON'T GET TO MANIPULATE THEM LIKE THAT THEY DON'T CARE THERE'S A DOWNSIDE TO IT WHICH IS MAYBE THEY'RE JUST IN DIRECT MARKERS IGHT AND SO I'M NOT TELLING YOU BIOLOGICAL MARKERS ARE BETTER THAN PERFORMANCE MARKERS WHEN OF SAYING IS YOU WANT O LOOK AT BOTH IN FACT YOU WNT TOLOOK AT O THIRD CATEGORY AS WELL WHICH IS SOME SORT OF SYMPTOMOLOGY AND SO AM I II AM M HAVING A SYMPTOM OF OVEREACHING AM I SEEING A PERFORMAN SACRAMENT AND H A MI SAEING A BIOLOGICAL MARKERS WELL IF YOU SEE ALL THREE OF THESE POPPING NUP YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE YOU'VE REACHED SOME OVER REACHING NOW WHAT YOU HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED YET IS IF THAT IS FUNCTIONAL OVER REACHING NON FUNCTIONALVER REACHING ARE TRUE OVERTRAINING AND REMEMBER YOU SHOULDN'T BE FEELING GREAT AFTER EVERY TRAINING SESSION YOU'RE TRYING TO CAUSE ADAPTATION AND UNTELL YOU BACK OFF MAYBE EVEN WEEKS FOR MONTHS LATER TO ACTUALIZE THE ADAPTATION AND GET THAT SUPER COMPENSATION IN PERFORMANCE INCREASE YOU'RE GIT TO HAVE TO INVESTILIT A BIT SO YOU'RE GOAN T GO ON THE WHOLE IM ANY SPORT PERFORMERCE COACH IS GOING TO LOOK OUT NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ANDE A YEA YA WHEN WE FIRST START TRAINING IN PREPARATION FOR THE SEASON WE ARE GOING TO SEE A DROP IN PERFORMACE THAT DAY THAT WEEK THAT'S PART OF THE PLAN  RIGHT TH AT'S THE STRESS YOU'RE TRYING TO CUMULATE SO YOU WANT U SEE ALL THREE OF THOSE MARKERS YOU JUST WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO A COUPLE OF THANGS HOW LONG ARE THEY DOWN FOR A DAY THREE DAYS SEVEN DAYS FIFTEEN DAYS ET CETERA IF YOU'RE SEEING A PERFORMONCE DROP IN A DAY AND I AM FAR AWAY FROM FROM PERFORMANCE A SO THE DAY THAT I WNT A PIQUE FOR I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT IF I SEE TOO DAYS IN R A DROP PERFORMANCE I'M NOT WORD IF I SEE MORE THAN PROBABLY IN IN MY OPINION FIVE DAYS IN A ROW IF JACRAMENT THEN I MIGHT STAR PAYING ATTENTION IF YOU'RE IN SEASON THOUGH OR CLOSE TO COMPETITION OR WHATEVER THAT THING MEANS TO YOU AND YOU SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF DAYS IN WORD OF A DROPPING THEN YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT TO TAKE SOME SOME STEPS TO MITIGATE THAT SO IT REALLY IS IMPORT YOU UNDERSTAND AGAIN WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO ARE WE TRYING TO CAUSE ADAPTATION ARE WE TRYING TO CAUSE AAPTATION AND I I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF ALL THIS WE CAN RUN THROUGH I HEAR IN A SECOND AND IN OF COURSE ABUNTOF TOOLS TO TO PULL YOUATOS FASES BUT THAT'S THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AGAIN DON'T WE TOO REACTIVE RESPONSE O TO ANY ONE MEASURE I COVER A WHOLE BUNCH OF OMIN A SECOND BUT YOU CAN GET LOST IN INDIFFERENT THINGS CAUSE THEY ALL HAVE PROSE AND CONSE AND SO I KNOW IT'S SIMPLE TO JUST LOOK AT ONE SCORE ON YOUR WATCH AND MAKE YOUR DECISIONS BECAUSE OF THAT OR CHECK YOUR AP BUT YOU REALLY WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF DOING THAT YOU'RE GIN PROBABLY LEAD YOURSELF IN THE WRONG DIRECTION MORE OFTEN THAN YOU GON O HELP YOURSELF I'M CURIUS AYS TO WHY WHEN WE OVERREACH TOO MUCH OR TOO OFTEN OR WE ARE OVERTRAINING THAT PERFORMANCE IS DIMINISHED BECAUSE ON THE FACE OF IT IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS YOU'RE OVER REACHING YOU'RE OVERTRAINING SO PERFORMANCE IS DIMINISHED BUT THAT'S COMPLETELY CIRCULAR YOU HEAR ABOUT THINGS LIKE A DREAM AL FATIGUE AND A DREAM OL BURN OUT WELL IT TURNS OUT A DREAM OL BURN OUT DOESN'T YOU REALLY EXIST ABSOLUTE NOW THERE IS IT SUCH A THING AS A REAMAL INSUFFICIENCY SINDRUM BY COURSE OF THESE PHRASES LIKE BURN OUT A DREAM OLL BURN OUT OVERTRAINING A THEY'RE THROWN AROUND I YOUYOU KNOW AS MUCH AS WORDS LIKE GHAS LIGHTING AND OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE YOU KNOW ARE WITHOUT ANY REAL CLENICAL DEFINITION A OR THERE ARE CLENICAL DEFINITIONS BUT PEOPLE AREN'T OBEYING THEM WHEN THEY USE THE LANGUAGE I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOWEVER WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE WHICH IS THAT OVERREACHING TOO MUCH TOO OFTEN OVERTRAINING THESE CAN DEGRADE PERFORMANCE BUT MECHANISTICALLY SPEAKING WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE I THINK ONCE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON MECHANISTICALLY THAN I THINK A WE CAN ALL LOOK AT TOOLS WHETHER NOT IT'S BREATHING MOVEMENT COMPRESSION THERMOL PSYCHOLOGICAL A MOTIVATION OR ET CETERA AND HAVE A MUCH CLEAR SENSE AS TO WHAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST AND WHAT LIKELY WON'T WORK I LOVE THIS QUESTION SO MUCH BECAUSE AS THI MENTION AT THE BEGINNING I I WAS FORTUNATE TO SPEND MY I SOME MY CRADUAT WORK AN ANDI FRIES LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS AND WE WE DID A LOT IN THIS AREA AND SO WEEK  FACT THIS IS HOW I LEARNED HOW TO DO ASSAYS AND RUN WESTERN BLOTS AND MEASURE SINGLING BROTINES AN THINGS LIKE THIS SO THE STUFF IS NEAR DEAR TO MY HEART WHOE ALSO DID A BUNCH OF REALLY WILD STUDIES AND HE HAD DONE SO BEFORE I GOT THERE SO I'M GOING TO COMBINED KIND OF ANDY FRIES ENTIRE CAREER AND JUST HIGH LI SOM OF THE BIG PICTURES OF WHAT HE FOUND THERE A HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN EXERCISE PARTICULARLY STRAINGTH TRAINING AND TRYNG TO FIGURE OUT THIS ENTIRE QUESTION RIT WHICH IS LIKE WISES ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN I WORK OUT TOO MUCH WHEN I LIFT TOO MUCH THAT ALL THE SUDDEN I CAN'T SLEEP WHAT'S HAPPENING LIKE WHY IS MY ENERGY DOWN WHY IS MY MOOD MY MOTIVATION REDUCED IF I SQUAT TOO MUCH IT SO WE DID A WHOLE SERIES OF STUDIES ACROSS THIS CAREER AND A GAIL JUS SORT OF HIGH LIGHT SOME THE THE SOME OF THE THEMES THAT RAN THROUGH THEM SO THE FIRST ONE THT JUMPS OUT TO MINE IS EARLIEST CAREER HE THIS REALLY OSTENPROTOCAL I OR HE HAD PEOPLE SQUAT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THEIR BACK SQUAT MAX EVERY DAY FOR TWO WEEKS SO YOU COME INI TO THE GEMAND AND I THINK THIS FIRST ONE WAS ON A MACHINE AND YE DID ONE RUP MAX AND YOU CAME BACK IN EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR TWO WEEKS SO THESE ARE WHAT WE WOULD GENERALLY CALL COND OF TAC THAT SHORT TO MODERATE RANGE OVER REACHING AND BY DEFINITION SOME OF THEM IN UP ACTUALLY BEING TRUE OVERTRAINING BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE THE INDIVIDUALS SOMETIMES TWO T UP TO EIGHT WEEKS TO RETURN BACK TO THEIR ONE RUP MAX AT THNG OF THESE PROTOCALS M SO SOME OF THEM WERE NON FUNCTION OVER EACHING OR SOME COMMONATION OF THAT WELL ALONG WITH THAT HE TOOK A A LOT OF BLOOD SAMPLES AS WELL AS MUSCLE BYOBSEES TO TRY TO LOOK OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING INTERCOLOGICALLY  NOR LOGICALLY MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY WIES TO TO PAY ATTENT WAS APAN SO COUPLE OF THINGS THAT JUMP OUT THERE IM ONE OF HIS INITIAL STUDIES ACTUALLY I THINK THE VERY FIRST WENTHY DID M WHEN THEY RAN THAT FIRST A SQUAT EVERY DAY PROTOCAL WHAT THEY FOUND US COUNTICOLOMY LEVELS CHANGE QUITE SIGNIFICALLY IM IN DEPENDING ON KONE OF WHAT YOU WANTED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THERE WHETHER IT WAS UP AN AFRONOR NOR UP AN AT FRAN IM OR EVEN A SOME OTHER MARKERS THEY BASICALLY INCREASED BY SOMEWHERE BETWEN TWO TO THREETFOLD AND SO A LITTLE BIT OF UNDERSTANDING OF SLEEP PHYSIOLOGY IF I DRANTALIN IS EXTREMELY HIGH AP AN EFFREND YOU GCING TO HAVE A HARD TIME SLEEPING SO THAT ALONE WAS WAS FIRST INDICATIONS  LIKE WAIT A MINUTE SOMETHIG'S ACTUALY HAPPENING HERE THAT'S JUST BEYOND MUSCLE SORENESS THERE'S SOME SORT OF SYSTAMIC FATIGUE HAPPENING AND AS YOU RIGHTFULLY POINTED OUT IS NOT THE DRENAL GLANCE BECOMING FATIGUED THAT SORT OF A BIT OF TONGUE AND CHEEKED BEDANTICS IT IS COURSE ALL THIS REGULATION AND GENERAL STRESS CENDROM IM BUT IT'S REALLY CAN BE NOTED IN IN BLOOD IN TERMS OF UP AN EFFEREN AND A NOR UP IN EFFEREN ANOTHER STUDY HE HAD DONE OF A SIMILAR ROUND WAS OVER THE COURSE OF SEVEN HALF DAYS PEOPLE CAME ININTO FIFTEEN TRAINING SESSIONS SO IS REALLY COOL TIES ARE THESE REALLY SHORT BOUTS OF JUST RIDICULOU TRAINING AND THEY SAID O KATE LIKE SOMES HAPPENING WITH WITH APERNAFERAN AND ORPAN T FRON SOME HAP SOMETHING'S HAPPENING WITH TOSTOSTRON WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE INSIDE OF THE SELVES AN O MUSCLE BIOBSES CAME ON BOARD AND THEY STARTED LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE MAP KINACES WHICH ARE THESE SIGNALING PROTINS THAT ARE TEN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ANABOLIC RESPONSE EY UP REGULATE MUCH MUSCLE PROTING SYNTHESIS AND THEY DO MANY OTHER THINGS BUT THAT'S LIKE A  BIG FACTOR OF THEM IM THEY LOK TO VARIOUS ANDRGENS AND GOOK A QUARTER QUART RECEPTORS AND THEY WENTED TO SEE LIKE MAYBE RECEPTOR DENSITY OR AND OR SENSITIVITY IS CHANGING ND IN FACTS APRISE SURPRISE THAT'S EXACTLY WHT THEY FOUND SO THEY FOUND BOTH ANDROGEN AND GOOKA QUARTER QART RECEPTOR CONCENTRATIONS WERE REDUCED AND SO YOU CAN START TO SEE A PICTURE FOR ME WHICH IS LIKE HUM VERY SIMILAR TO THE INSOLEN TYPE TWO DIABETY STORY WHERE YOU YOU'VE REALLY PUT YOURSELF IN A VERY HIGH STRESSED SITUATION SO PRESUMABLY APENAPERAN ET CETERA TESTOSTRON RELEASES ARE EXTREMELY HIGH IN RESPONSE TO THAT TO TRY TO REACH BACK TO SOME LEVEL OF HOME OSTACES YOU START DOWN REGULATING THE RECEPTORS FOR THEM AND SO WAS LIKE THE SIGNAL CAN ONLY GET SO HIGH IF YOU'RE GING TO KEEP THAT GAS ON WORGEN A PULL BACK THE THROTTLE ON THE RECEPTORS SO THAT THE TOTAL SIGNAL SAVES THE SAME IF THAT MAKES LITTLO ASSENT WILL HAT BECOMES OVOSY PROBLEMATIC IMSO THEN I LIKE A A FINAL FOLLOW UP STUDY HERE THAT AT IT'S IMPORTANT NOTIS THEY DID ANOTHER PROTOCOL WHICH WAS REALLY REALLY COOL AND THEY SAID THE FIRST ONES WEREN'T ENOUGH SO HOW ABOUT THIS WE'RE GOINGTO COME IN EVERY DAY FOR TWO WEEKS AND WE'RE GOING TO DO TEN SETS OF ONE REP MAX EVERY DAY SO THEY WERE COMING IN AND THEY WOULD DO TEN ONE REP MAXES EVERY DAY FOR TWO WEEKS AND WITH THREALLYCOOL ABOUT THAT STUDY IF THEY DIDN'T COMPLETE ANY OTHE RE PETITIONS THEY HAD TO REPEAT IT UNTIL THEY HAD TEN SUCCESSFUL ONE REMAXES ON THAT GIVEN DAY A ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL BRUTAL PROTACO I WASN'T THERE AT THE TIME I THEY HAD FINISHED THAT RIGHT BEFORE I GOT ON CAMPUS BUT I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO BE AROUND WHEN THE WERE DOING SOME OF THE FINAL ANALYSES THERE ARE THE TISSUE I WHAT THY WANT TO LOOK AT N THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WAS BADE T ADGERNURGIC RECEPTORS WHICH ARE THOSE RECEPTORS WORTH THAT ARE GON TO BE EPERNA FRON E SECTHRA TO BE BINDING FOR SO AGAIN SIMILAR STORY HERE A PERHAPS ARE WE LOSING OVER ALL SENSITIVITY BECAUSE OF THIS EXTREME  SYMPATHETIC STIMULATION OW ACTUALLY THINKING BACK WHAT WOULDHAVE BEEN PRETTY COOLS IF THEY HAD ANOTHER GROUP THAT DID IT AD DID SOME DOWN REGULATION BREATHING POSE TO SEE IF THEY COAN AMILIARATE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WEDOF COURSETIS WAS TWENTY PLUSS YEARS AGO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IM COUPLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IS THE ONE REP MAXES DROPPED BY THINK AROUND LIKE EIGHT KEELOS BY THE END OF THE TWO WEEKS IIF I REMEMBER RIGHT LIKE THE GROUP AVERAGE WITH SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF A UNDRED FIFTY ONE KEELOS O THESE WERE PETTY WELL TRAINE INDIVIDUALS AND IT WENT FROM  RATHER I THINK ACTUALLY IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY KEELOES N THEY DROPPED LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO KILOS SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT WHATWAS MORE  SIGNIFICANT THOUG WAS THEIR POWER D ROPPED BY THIRTY FIVE PER CENT WHICH IS REALLY REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IF IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO DECLINES IN PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE OVER TIME AND I MEAN THAT LIKE THROUGH AGING WEL YOU'LL SEE AS PEOPLE CAN HOLD ON THE MUSCLE MASS PRETTY WELL IT WILL GO DOWN ABY ABOUT INTA ONE PER CENT OR SO AFTER THE AGE OF FORTY HOWEVER STRENGTH WILL GO DOWN AT LIKE TWO TO FOUR PER CENT AND THEN POWER BY EIGHT TO TEN PER CENT AND IF YOU LOOK AT ACTUALLY WORLD RECORDS ACROSS STRANK SPORTS BY AGE YOU'LL SEE THAT THEY WILL DECLINE BY AGE BUT NOT THAT MUCH HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT SPEED SPORTS BY AGE THEY FALL OFF THE PLANET SO IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO PRESERVE FAST THROUGH TIME WHETHER THIS IS FATIGUE OR BECAUSE OF A AGE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'LL THEN TELL YOU HAY A LITTE BIT OF A CANARY IN THE COAL MINE IS NOT NECESSARILY YOUR STRENGTH BUT YOUR SPEED AND SO A LOT OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES THAT WE USE TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE REMEMBER THAT'S OUR TRY ATRIGHT SIMPTOMOLOGY PHYSIOLOGY IN PERFORMANCE I'M YOUR GENERALLY BETTER LOOKING AT SPEED BASE PERFORMANCE TESTS RATHER THAN STRENGTH BAST PERFORMANCE TUS TO GET AN EARLIER INDICATION OF POTENTIAL OVER REACHING OR OVERTRAINING DON'T AN MIT'S BACK TO THE THE INDIVIDUAL STUDY THERE IN THAT SAME GROUPE IT CAN WE HAE THE SAME PROBLEM WHERE IT TOOK SOME OF THEM TWO TO EIGHT WEEKS TO COME BACK SO WHAT THEY HAD TO DO IS I CAME RO R TH EXACT TIME FRAME I PROBLY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH THIS BUT THEY HAD THEY HAD TO COME BACK SOMETHING LIKE EVERY WEEK OR EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS EVEN AFTER THE STUDY FINISHED AND TELL THEY GOT BACK TO THEIR BASELINE ONE RET MACKS AND SOME OF THEM IT TOOK THEM UP TO EIGHT WEEKS BEFORE THEY FINALLY GOT BACK SO THEY PROBABLY WERE IN A CLASSIC OVER TRAINING STATE OF THAT POICE WHICH IS WAS DONE AND AS LITTLE AS TO WEEKS AND THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER POINT THAT PEOPLE AWAYS ASK LIKE HOW HOW LONG IS IT TAGE IS TIS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF MONTHS OR IT LIKE IF I WERE TO GO TO TWO DAYS OR THIS INTENSE TRAINING CAMP FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS COULD I ACT A CAUSE OR TRAINING AND THE ANSWER IS IF IT IS ACTUALLY TRULY ENOUGH VOLYU AND ENOUGH INTENSITY YOU PROBABLY CAN DO SOME SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN AS LITTLE AS TWO WEEKS PRBABLY DOSN'T HAPPEN ON OFTEN MOST LIKELY YOU YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE REACHING A STATE OF NONE FUNCTIONAL OVER REACHING BUT YOU MAY ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE I MIGHT TAKE THREE OR FOUR WEEKS OR MORE TO GET BACK THE BASELINE AFTER A TRULY INTENSE AND AGAIN THINK ABOUT THIS PROTOCAL IT'S LIK TOTALLY UNREALISTIC FOR THE MOST PART TEN SES OF ONE OF A ONERAT MAC QUAT EVERY DAY FOR TWO STRAIT WEEKS SOME FOLKS IF YOU'RE EXTREMELY HIGHLY TRAINED WEITH LITHTHROUGHYOU MIGHT DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEN YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO SAY WORLD CHAMPION SHIPS BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT REALY SPECIFIC CINARIAL IT'S A TOTALLY ABSURD TRAINING PROTICL BUT THAT WAS THE POINT RIGHT WE WERE TRYING TO INSURE IN SURE THAT OVERTRAINING WAS MET OR CLOSE IT'S SIMILAR TO WHEN WE'VE DONE AT WEVE ECTIN  A THINK THREE STUDIES AN THE SENAPR OR PERFORMANCE ON ABDOMS MUSCLESORNESS IND AN ALL THOSE CASES YOU DO JUS LIKE RIDICULOUS LIKE SENTIAL PROTOCALLS COULD YOU JUST TRYING TO INSURE YOU CAUSE SUPERSORNISSY IF YOU DON'T THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO STUDY SO ABSURD TRAINING PRALLS PROTOCALLS BUT BUT THAT'S THE POINT SO NONE THE LESS IM AS RESULTS SURE ENOUGH THE BATO ABGERNEGEC RECEPTORS WERE DOWN REGULATED BY SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT WHAT'S PROBABLY EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT THOUGH WAS HE SENSITIVITY IN THOSE RECEPTORS I WAS REDUCE BY LIKE TO AN HALFFOLD AND SO IT'S LIKE OK WAT AMINUTE WE'RE BECOMING DECENTS ATIZE THIS TIME YE IAN WE'RE ALL SO ACTING OUF STARTING TO REDUCE OUR TOTAL CONCENTRATION SIMILAR WASH IS ACTUALLYAN INTERESTING WAS A VERY A SNEAKY SMART THING TO DO IS THEY LOOKE THAT NOCTURNAL YURINARYUP AN EFFRON AND GUESS WHAT THAT WAS ALSO UP BY LIKE FIFTY PERCENT IS LOOKNG ONE OR FIVE FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO YE AND SO NOW YOUR SEEING THIS TIAN WHERE IT'S LIKE UM I'M SEEING RESPONSE AT THE TISSUE LEVEL I'M SEEING A RESPONSE PROBABLY ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY LOOK AT A PETUITARIAN LIKE THAT I'M I'M SEEN A DREAMAL AND OTHER ANNICHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND THEN I'M ALSO SEEING THIS INCREASE IN CONCENTRATION OF BAN EPIN EFERON WHEN I'M SUPPOSED TO BE SLEEPING AND SURPRISE SURPRISE I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SLEEPING I'M SYMPTOMOLOGYN BUT THAT'S A A VERY INTERESTING FINDING ABOUT A NOCTURNAL EPINEFERAN EPINEFRON OF COURSE IS A JORNAL AND IT'S RELEASE FROM THE ADREAMALS NO SUPRISE THERE BUT ALSO FROM THIS SPRANAREA CALLED LOCUS CERULIUS ON THE BRAIN THE BRANCH HAS TO BE CALLED UP ANEFERON IN THE BODY A JOURNAL AND JUST TO COMPLICATE EVERYONE IM UNDERSTANDING BUT THAT NOMONE CLATURE DID NOT COME FROM US THE DON'T BLAME US THE POINT IS THAT RAPID IE MOVEMENT SLEET SO CALLED REM SLEEP IS MORE ABUNDANT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT WE KNOW THAT THE DREAMS ASSOCIATED WITH RAPIDIVE MOVEMENT SLEEP ARE MORE A EMOTIONALLY LADEN AND THAT THOSE DREAMS AND THOSE EMOTIONAL STATES ARE ACTUALLY IMPORTANTANT FOR DISCARDING THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF PREVIOUS DAYS EXPERIENCES IT'S ACTS A SORT OF A  NATURAL TROMATHERAPY IF YOU WILL BECAUSE IN THE NORMAL HEALTHY STATE THOSE DREAMS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INABILITY TO RELEASE EPINEFRAN AT NIGHT SO FOR ME WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED FIRST WAULTS THAT FIRST O'M EVER HEARD OF IT AM BUT IT TIES TOGETHER SOMETHING REALLY A QUITE CLEAR FROM THE SLEEP NOR SCIENCE LITERATURE WHICH IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE STRESSE THEY TEND TO GET LESS RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP THAT RAPID IE MOVEMENT SLEEP NORMALLY IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW LEVELS OF APIN EFFERENC SO WHETHER NOT ITS CAUSAL OR NOT ISNANY CLEAR A BUT SORT IF DOESN'T MATTER FOR SAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION BUT WHAT I'M WONDERING AND I SUPPOSE ONE GOULD TASSFOR BUT MAY BE OBSERVED IS WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER IN OVERTRAINING TOO MUCH OVER REACHING TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THIS ELEVATED NOCTURNAL EPINEFRAN DIMINISH REMSLEEP WHETHER NOT THEIR EMOTIONAL STATE IS ALSO I'M DISRUPTED BECAUSE ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE AS IF YOU WANT TO DISRUPT SOMEBODY'S EMOTIONAL STATE YOU DEPRIVE THE OF SLEEP AND RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN PARTICULAR THE ONE COTY OT TO THAT IS FOR THOSE WE OUHT THERE THAT HAVE HEARD THAT RAPIDEYE MOVEMENT SLEEP DEPRIVATION DELIBERATE RAPI EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP DEPREVATION IS A TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION THAT IS TRUE BUT IT'S COUPLED WITH A NEXT NIGHT ENHANCED RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP SO ONE OF THE MAJOR TAKE AWAYS FROM ALL O THIS A THAT I'M REALIZING IS THAT NO SURPRISE DAYTIME ACTIVITIES IMPACK NIGHT TIME ENDICRAN FUNCTION IMPACT QUALITY OF SLEEP IMPACT DAYTIME ACTIVITIES YET ACTUALLY THIS I SO MANY FUN THINGS IT ON A DO HERE NOW I'M THIS IS ACTUALLY WY MEASURING I MOVEMENT IS A VERY FANTASTIC TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING TOTALSTRESTLOAD AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY DIFFERENTIATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRESS O CAFINE USE FOR A'LCALL USE FOR SLEEP DEPROMATION BY S ACTUALLY MEASURING I MOVEMENTS THAT'S UCTION WHAT WE DO IN OUR ABSOLUTE REST SLEEP COMPANY IS IN ADDITION TO GETTING A A FULL PST SLEEPSTUDY DONE IN YOUR BEDROOM WYOU'REGETTINGINTON I TRACKING A SESSIMENT WHICH PRIGA BIL THE FIGU WHY YOU'RE GTTIG THERE SO IMNONE THE LESS YET IF YOU CTUALLY LOOK AT THE CLASSIC SINS AND SYMPTOMS OF OVER TRAINING OR OVERTRAINING SINDRUM ANDSTEAD OF BE EVERYTHING FROM PERFORMANCE DACRAMENTS LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT I' WHAT RESTING HEART RAIHT IS GOING TO INCREASE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THINGS LIKE EIGHT ARV DROP BY GENERALLY TWENTY OR SO PER CENT I THAT WOULD BE VERY LARGE A DISRUPTIONE NATURE E 'M DECREASE BODY WEIGHT AND THEN ALL THE STUFF ENDER YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT SO MOTIVATION ADHERENTS APPETITE MOOD IM ALL O THIS STUFF E ARE OUR CLASSICALLY KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS WITH WITH OVER TRAING AND THAT'S FOR THE EXACTORIES SINCE YOU TALK ABOUT SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND DISRUPTIONS IM WANTING TO TRAIN MOTIVATION ALL OF THIS STUFF A GOES PARTON PARCEL WITH F NON FUNCTIONAL OVER REACHING AND OR OVER TRAINING I'M YOU CAN ACTUALY TIGHT UST BACK HIN A LITTE MORE TO SOME OTHER BILE MARKERS AN THIS GRATE BECAUSE THIS TIS STUFF WE LOOK FOR THIS IS THE THE PHYSIOLOGYS SIF WE LOOK FOR IM YOU'VE PROBABLY TALKED ABOUT A ES B G BEFORE IM WHICH IS A SEXFORMAL BINING GLOBULENT SO SS  PROTENE THAT THT'LL FLOAT IN YOUR BODY THIS CANNOT BIND UP  SEX FORN MONTHS AND PARTICULAR TUSTOSTRON SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH I'M OVERTRAINING AS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THIS SERILY LKE WEEK BY WEEK AND YOU CALL CTUALLY SEE THIS NUMBER RISE AND SO IF YOU SEE THIS LIKE SAY YOU'RE USING A A A SERVICE LIKE CAN SI TRACKER AND YOU'R GETTING YOUR YOUR BLOOD MEASURED EVERY SO OFTEN AND YOU SEE THIS NUMBER SRIK TICKING UP THIS IS ACTUALLY SOCIATED WITH THAT BECAUSE WITS ACTUALLY HAPPENINGS IS BINING UP ALL YOUR FREE TESTOSTRO ANDATS IS LEADING BACK TO THE CIRCLE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND YOU C ACTUALY SE THE SAME THING HAPPEN WITH CALORY RESTRICTION I' DOES NOT ENOUGH CALORIES BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE IT ACTUALY HAPPENS IN BOSSINARIOS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A ISSUE SIMPLY OF BEING UNDER CALORIED IT'S CLEARLY AN ISSUE OF OF THE TRAINING LOAD BEING TOO HIGH SO JUST TO GIVEN ANOTHER LITTLE TOOL THERE'S A I CAN GET THE LINK FOR IT BUT THERE'S A A WEBSIHT THAT I WAS CREATED BY A YOU WICH JOURNAL AH SLIPIN BUT I'LL GET IT TO YO YOU CAN LINK IT UP WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO IN AND PLUG IN A NUMBER OF VALUES FROM BLOOD CHEMISTRY SO IF YOU GOT YOUR BLOOD WORKED ON AND YOU CAN PLUG IN YOU'R PREE NUMBER AND YOU'RE POST NUMBER SO SA YOU GOT IT DONE AND THEN MAY BE TEN WEEKS LATER YOU GOT IT DONE AGAIN ANDYOU'RE WONDERING AND YOU NOTICE HAY MY FREE TESTOSTRUMS DOWN OR MY ESSI BEG IS UP IS IT ACTUALLY MEANING FUL NUMBER AND YOU IT WILL ACTUALLY TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT THE CHANGE PREETO POST IS PHYSIOLOGIALLY MEANINGFUL OR NOT OR DIS WITHIN THE AIR MARGIN OF THE MEASURE IWHEN YOU C ACTUALLY CHANGE RIKHE LIKE RIGHTHEROUN THE WUBSIDE YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR CONFIDENCE INTERVAL SO 'TO REALY REALLY COOLIT IF IF OU NOW IF YOU JUST HAVE YOUR OWN BLOOD YOU ANTO NO LIKE HA I HAD A ANY LEVEL THIS YERE AND NOW IT'S NOW HERE OVER THERE IS UST A TORALLY FREE RESOURCE I CREATED  CONTRAPURE OF YOU ALL THAT STOFF AN I'LL GIVE THE LINK TO THAT SO THAT'S A PRETTY COOL A MEASURE IN ADDITION TO THAT LIKE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE POWERFUL AND EASY METRICS ABIOLOGICALLY IS TO TAKE YOUR CRTISALL DEATI RATIO SO THIS IS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF THINGS YOU WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL YOU DON'T WANT THIS NUMBER TO BE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW SOMETHING LIKE ZERO POINT ZERO NINE IT IT IS A NONT ECORTES ALL TO DGA DTIATED CORSAL RATIO YETET CUORTIZOL A LOVE TO TELL YOU I SAIT IT BACKWARDS ON PURPOSE JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD BUT I GOT IT THAT YET I MEAN THIS RATIO HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SO MANY THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO YOU DO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH ASSOCIATION IT NOT BEING CAUSATION BUT EVERYTHING FROM RISK OF INFACTION SOME METABOLIC HEALTH AND AN LIKE OTHER DISEASE TATS AS WELL AS MORE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I WHICH IS HEY MY MI MI GETTIN SORT OF CORTISAL THIS REGULATION WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD CALL YOU KNOW AGAIN I' DRIN NOL FATIGUE A THOUGH IT'S NOT REALY IT'S HAPPENING BUT IF AT DRENL IN AND A BANEHRUNNER OFF AND TO STOSTRO CORTISALLS GOING TO BE LONG THE RIGHT AND SO YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE TESTASTRON OF CORTISON RATIOS SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN GLEAN HERE TO GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHTS AND WHEREYOU'RE GOING IF THAT IF THAT RATIO IS TOO HIGH THAT'S GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BAT A BOLECAND DROM AN ABOUT YOUR OTHER STUFF IF IT'S TOO LOW THAT'S GOIN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF COGNITIVE PROBLEMS LIKE A GRESSION AND MOOD AND IN A BUNCH OF THINGS LIKE THAT SO AN CAN YOU WANT TO KEEP IT RIGHT AROUND THAT ZERO POINT ZERO NINE RATIO AND AND MOST THE TIME ACTUALLY IN SOME BLOOD CHEMISTRYSTUFF YOU'LL GET A YOU GET REPORT OF THAT OR YOU CAN CALCULATED PRETTY QUICKLY I'M SURE WE'L GET INTO THIS IN THE EPISODE THAT COMES NEXT TON A NUTRICION AND SUPPLEMENTATION ORLY WHAT ABOUT COMPOUNDS THAT LOWER CORTES ALL SUCH IS ASHWALL GON DO A I CAN SEE NOW BASE ON THE LOGIC YOUR SPELLING OUT THAT DURING PHASES OF A LOT OF INTENSE OVER REACHING YOUR FREQUENT OVER REACHING GIVEN THAT THOSE COMPOUNDS AND INDEED LOWER CARTISALL RODOLI ITRODOLIA ROSATIA RODIOLA RODIOLA ROSATIA AM ON WORD TO SAY AM TWO WORDS BUT THE FIRST ONE MORTONE TO SAY RODIOLA RODATIA RODIOLA ROSEA RODIOA ROSEA FOLKS AND ASCHODONDA AM I'VE BEEN I TRYING RODIOLA RECENTLY UM AND MAINLY AS A BOFFER TO OUTPUT AM IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE SOME GOOD DATE A ATTACHED TO IT RELATED TO LOWERING A ONCE PERCEIVED THRESHOLD OF HOW HARD THEIR WORKING SO ANOTHER AS YOU CAN WORK HARDER A MAN NOT FEEL AS IF YOU'RE WORKING REALLY HARD WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO DO MORE WORK A THAT' SORT OF THE SUBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION OF OUT WORKS BUT YOU TOLD ME THAT IT AM CAN BLUNT CARTISALL AND ASHOGONDA WE KNOW BLUNTS CARTISALL BOTH OF THESE THINGS OF COURSE CAN DO OTHER THINGS BUT ARE THESE UM COMPOUNDS THAT YOU SOMETIMES WILL INCORPORATE INTO A A TRAINING REGIMEN I WO HAVE BEEN USING RODIOLA FOR PROBABLY SIX OR MORE YEARS PRETTY CONSISTENTLY NOT PERCELY BUT A USING IT WITH THE INVIDUAL TO WORK WITH YOU DO NEED TO BE LITTLE BIT CAREFUL I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IT BLUNTS CARTISAL IT IS PROBABLY MORE PURPALY DESCRIBED AS A CORTISAL MODULATOR  WHICH MEAN SORT OF IT GETS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW IN ILL HELP CIN TO KEEP IT WITHIN NORMIT OF RANGE THERE'S ALSO THERE IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN A HANDFULEST IES IT TOO O I KNOW SPECIFICALLY SHOWD THAT A RODIOLUS GON HAND STRENGTH GAINS HOWEVER IT MAY REDUCE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE SO WE NEED MORE HUMAN DATA ON THE STUFF AND IT MAY TURN OUT THAT'S NOT A CONCERN ME ALSO TOE NOT TO BE CONCERN SO NOTHING IS NOTHING IS PERFECT AND FRE THERE IS NO SUPPLEMENT THAT IS A PANNASIA AND A I HAVE USED AGAIN RODIOA IN A LOT OF SITUATIONS BECAUSE THE THE THING I CANNOT TE PITENTUE THE ORTISALL IS IS YOU IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE MODULATED THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS NORMAL NOW IN FACT IF YOU LOK AP NORMITOF VALUES I MYSTIPIDLY A DESCRIBED IN A MICROGRAMS PRODEST THE LEADER AND DEPENDING ON LITERALLY WHAT COMPANY USE TO DRAW YOUR BLOOD IF YOURE GETTING IT THROUGH THE BLOOD A DEPENDING ON WHAT WHICH METHOD THEY USED TO ANALYZED THAT THE NOMENT OF VALUES ARE LIKE FRANKLY EMBARRASSINGLY ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE MOSTLY GOING TO BE LIKE FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE AS A CORNONCORT NORMEN OF VALUE BUT THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS WE ALSO KNOW THOSE NUMBERS VERY MASSIVELY BY AGE I SEX AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND SO IF YOU ONLY AR TAKING A SINGLE POINT THIS ASSUME YOU DOING A FAST A BLOOD DROP WHICH IS WHAT MOST FOLKS DO IT'S REALLY ONLY GOINGTO TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT MOMENT WE NEED TO KNOW WELL LIKE MAY BE LET'S SAY MY CARTISALL WAS IF I'M A SAY THIRTY EIGHT YEAR OLD WOMAN AND MY SEVEN A M CARTISAL WAS FIFTEEN MILIGRAMS T US LATER THAT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT IF IT'S FIFTEEN MILOGRAMS FOR DESOLATOR AT THREE P M OH BOY I'M I'M AN PROBABLY HAVING SOME ISSUES I SO THERE'S A CHAIN THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PLOT THAT CRSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY  PRETTY STAND OF PRACTICE THAT WE DO AS WE LOOK AT CORTISAL THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE'RE GONG TO TAKE MULTIPA MARKRERS CAUSE I DON'T WANTED TO SEE YOUR BASELINE CORTESAL I WANT SEE THIS CURVE THROUGHOUT THE DAY THAT'S GOINGT TELL ME A TON ABOUT IAGAIN AS YOUR SLEEP BEING CAUSED BY THIS REGULATION I IS IT YOUR TRAINING IS OF SOMETHING ELSE O I WOULD BUT TAKE A SINGLE BASELINE BLOOD MARKER OF CORTESAL WITH A LOT OF  GRAIN ISALL WE WITH TYPICALLY MEASURE AT LEAST THREE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAYS OF SOMETHING LIKE SIX TO NINE I M TWELVE TO THREE IN AN SOMETHING MYK CLOSER TO THE EVENING OFTEN TIMES WE DO MUCH MORE I WILL DO LIKE SEVEN POINTS ARE SOMETHING LIKE THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY DEPENNING ON SITUATION S YOU WANTO BE CAREFUL OF THAT I JUST TINCE WERE HERE YOU CAN AL SWEET CORTISAL IN A THROUGH SALIVA AND NOW THAT SORT OF PROSAN CONS TO THAT BECAUSE THE THE PRO OF DOING IT IN YOUR BLOOD IS IT'S IT IT'S MUCH MORE STABLE I'M SELIVA IS EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE TO WHATEVER HAPPENED THESE SECONDS BEFORE YOU TOOK THAT TUS THE UPSIDE OF IT THOUGH AS YOU CAN DO A BUNCH FOR REAL WORL LIFE EXPERIMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE WILL DO THIS SOMETIMES IF WE WANT TO SEE HOW AN INDIVIDUAL IS RESPONDING TO A GIVEN STRESSER LET'S TAKE IT RIELES TAKE TH TAKIN THE YO SPENNIN T WITH TUBERN I TAKIT AND WEREGNGTO COU DO W THIS WORK OUT OR THI COLDES POSURE WERE GING TO DO TAKE IT TAN WE KNOW THAT IT'S RESPONSIVE TO WHAT JUST HAPPENE BUT THAT'S THE POINT ISO YOU CAN ACTAL LY THIS SORT OF PROSEIN CONSO YOU'L USE THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE FOR THE APPROPRIATE A QUESTION YOU'RE TRYING TO ANSWER A COUPLE OF POINTS AND REFLECTIONS ABOUT QARTESAL BY FIRST A LABORATORY DUTY AS AN UNDERGRADUATE WAS IN A ZASHY IN A BA PSYCHOLOGY LAB AT THE TIME THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE FIELD OF NAURO SCIENCE AS IT'S NOW CALLED IT WAS CALLED BY O PSYCHOLOGY OR PSYCHO BIOLOGY AT ANOTHE NA THERE WAS USING NAURO CHAMISTRY IN NEUROBOLOGY THEY'D ALL COLLAPSED INTO WHAT WE GT NOW CALLED NARO SCIENCE IM WHICH IS ONLY I THROH U SOME YEARS AGO BUT MY JOB WAS TO COLLECT CORTESALL SAMPLES WHICH MEANS I I WAS COLLECTING AM SPIT WHICH MEANS I WAS COLLECTING SELIVA AN THE AN ADVANTAGE OF SELIVA BASE CUARTISALITS FREE CARTESAL ITS THE ACTIVE FORM OS YOU MENTION IT'S REFLECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPEND IN THE  SECONDSER MINUTES A JUST PRIOR THE A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT THE REGULAR UARTSALL PATTERN ACROSS THE DAY BECAUS I REALIZE THAT WHILE I BE WONDERFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO GET THEIR QARTESALL MEASURED IN DETAIL MULTIPLE TIMES AND BLOOD AND AND SELIVA AND SO ON SOME PEOPLE JUST WON'T DO THAT A FOR WHATEVER REASON OR CAN'T DO THAT YET A THE BASIC CONTOUR OF A HEALTHY PATTERN OF CORTESALL SECRETION IS A TO HAVE HIGHEST LEVELS OF ORTESAL IN THE MORNING AM IT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THE MECHANISM THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH WAKING YOU UP VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHT IDEALLY FROM SUNLIGHT BUT OTHER FORMS OF BRIGHT LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY ACTUALLY CAN LEAD TO A FIFTY PERCENT FIVE ZERO PERCENT INCREASE IN THAT QUARTES ALL SPIKE WHICH IS A GOOD THING YOU WILL  ELEVATED CORTESAL ON REARLY TELVE THAT'S IN MOTION A CASCADE OF THINGS RELATE TO ENHANSOME OOD AND ALERTNESS AND MUN SYSTEM FROM NCTION ET CETERA WHAT I THINK IT CAN BE USEFUL FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT MANY THINGS WILL SPITE CORTISALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY STRESS COLD WATER EXERCISE BUT THE IDEAS THAT IT COMES DOWN TO BASE LINE OR NEAR BASE LINE AM RATHER QUICKLY ONE OF THE WORST SITUATIONS AS YOU POINT IT OUT IS WHEN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CORTUSALL IS CONSISTENTLY SHIFTED TO THE AFTERNOON PERIOD IN FACT THAT'S A I PRETTY RELIABLE SIGNATURE OF CERTAIN FORMS OF DEPRESSION THIS IS WORK BY I MY COLLY DAVE ITS PEOLE AT IM STANFOR CYCHATRY AND THE THE GREAT BOBSIPOLSKY ROBBERS OFPOLSKY OFA WISYBERS DON'T GET ALSERS BEHAVE ET CETERA IN FAME LOSTS AT LOSS OF POPULAR BOOKS THERE  I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO REGULATE THEIR CORTISALL AND THEY'RE JUST UNDER AN THEY JUST UNDERSTAND THAT BASIC CONTOUR THAT THE BASE LINE SHOULD BE YOU KDONT RISE PRETTY QUICKLY AFTER ONE RISES IN THE MORNING SO SEAS YOU REMEMBER RISE RISE IM RISE OUT OF BED AND RISE CORTISALL WITH LIGT A BRIGHT LIGHT WITH EXERCISE I'M WITH CATHENE THESE THINGS WILL ALL INCREASE CORTISALL AND THEN ACROSS THE DAY ITS NORMAL FOR CORTISALL TO SPIKE BUT THEN TO USE SOME OF THE DOWN REGULATION METHODS THAT YOU DESCRIBED IND PRO THE BREATHING METHODS AND EXERCISE ITSELF IS THE CASE MAY BE BUT THEN TO REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO HOW MUCH PSYCHOLOGICAL AN PHYSICAL STRESSIS OCCURRING IN THE SIX HOURS OR SO OR EIGHT HOURS PRIOR TO SLEEP I'M DISI SEEM LIKE A A GOOD TO BROAD CONTOUR OF HOW TO HAVE A HEALTHY PATTERN OF CORTS ALREADY SPEEC YOU AS YOU WANT THE CORTISALL TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND INITIATOR PARTICIPATE IN THE RECOVERY O WILL NOT SEE ANY PROGRESS FROM EXERCISE TRAINING WITHOUT A LARGE SPIKE AND CORTISOL IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE THINK OF PHRASES LIKE CORTISAL INFLAMMATION STRESS THIS IS NOT BAD PHYSIOLOGY IS NOT PESONIFIED ARE THERE THE THINGS DON'T LIKE ATE YOU IN THE BODY RIGT IT IS ALL IS NOT GOOD AND BAD THEY JUST ARE IM THE MORE YOU TRY TO SUPPRESS CORTISAL THE MORE YOU SUPPRESS ADAPTATION WHAT YOU WANT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU MENTION LARGE SPIKES MET WITH LARGE QUICK RECOVERY AND YOU WANT TO DO THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAYIND GET THAT HORMATIC STRESSER THIS IS SO TO GOING BACK TOR OSPAGANDA AND RODIOL ISO  IT I THINK WE'LD BE VERY SHORT SIGHTED FOR PEOPLE THAT DO THAT AS THIS IS A PROPLACTIC COULD YOU IF YOU BLUNT CORTISALL YOU'RE GOING TO CAUS HEM YOU KNOW SUPPRESS ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE DAY TOTAL TAKING O SHUR GON TO BEFORE GOING TO TRAIN AS IS TE COUNTERPERODUCT YET WWE DO NOT JUST THIS IS NOT A BASELINE PART OF OUR FOUNDATIONAL PACKAGE R IF YOU GO LOOK AT THE IMAT THE FOUNDATIONS ARE THE AST THE BRASILIANS PHOTA CALLS A PUT TOGETHER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THESE THINGS IND THERE FOR THAT SPECIFIC REASON ANY FORM OF CRTESALL REGULATION NEEDS TO BE DONE STRATEGICALLY IF YOU ARE EXCESSIVELY HIGH OR BRINGING YOU BACK DOWN THE NORMAN DEVALUES AT THE RIGHT TIME THEN GREAT IF YOU'RE NORMAL THOG THEN TAKING YOU DOWN LOWER THAN THAT IS ACTUALLY PROBLEMATIC THE SAME THING IS ACTUALLY TRUE SINCE WE'RE HERE FROXITE EF STRESS FARN INFAMMATION ANTIOXIDENT USE IWE MENTIONED AT HINK EARLIER ABOUT TAKING VITEM EN SEE INVI E M POST EXERCISE WILL ACTUALLY BLUNT ADAPTATIONS ORELEAST HAS A POTENTINAL TO DO SO SAME THING RIGHT IF YOU'RE MODULATING THIS RESPONSE JUST BECAUSE AND YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO BECAUSE OF A ACTUALLY BIOLOGICAL TESTING THAT INDICATED YOU NEED TO TO DO SUCH THEN YOU ACTUALLY MAY BE MAKING THINGS WORSE AND SO A WE WE SEE THIS CONSTANTLY WITH PEOPLE WHO TAKE A NUMBER OF SOPLOUMS AND SUBSTANCES FOR SLEEP AND THEN THEY WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING GROGGY AND YOUR YOUR CORTIS ALL SUPPRESSED O KAT GRAT SO THEN THEY TAKE SOMETHING FOR STIMULATION AND THEN THE REST THE DAY THEY'RE TRYING TORODUSE AND EN AN IN THIS NASTY CYCLE AS OT OF JUST GETTING OUT OF THE WAY AND LETTING CORTES ALL DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO AAND THEN MAKING SURE AGAIN YOU'RE TEACHING IT SO THIS ACTLY COACHABLE RESPONSE YOU CAN COACH YOUR OWN BODY TO GO DOWN IN THE LATER PAR OFTHE DAY AND GO UP IN THE EARLIER PART OF THE DAY WE YOU WAN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE DRIVING THAT TRAIN WITH INTENT AND SO AGAIN TO REITERATE IF YOU DON'T NEED THAT YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT ARE YIF YOU DON'T NEED TO LOWER CORTIZOL YOU SHOULDN'T WALK AROUND DOING ITYOU'RE JUST GOING TO SUPPRESS TE STATE EVEN FAR AND THIS IS WHAT'S NEED THIS IS NEEDED FOR ANABOLIC RESPONSE AR YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GROW MUSCLE IF CORTISALL IS NOT SPIKE IT'S ITQORTS GON TO COMPROMISE RATHER SO YOU WANT TO BE INTENTIONAL WITH THESE PRACTICES A ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF OF SUPPLEMENTATION BE VERY VERY INTENTIONAL I'VE HEARD IT SAID THAT CARBOHYDRATES IN PARTICULAR STARCHY CARBAHYDRATE ES I CAN INHIBIT CORTIS ALL DAF I AND A THIS COULD BE THROUGH THE A TRIP TO PAN A MENOACID RELATED PATHWAY THAT RATCHETS UP TO A SIRTONE AN RELEASE PROBABLY SOME OTHER THINGS TO IVMEAN THE IDEA THAT CARBOHYDRE'S JUST STIMULATES SERATONAN AS IT IS A LITTLE BIT A OVERLY S NOW THIS TEULAR MECHANISMS AY IN PIQUE GOING UP AND IMMEDATELY TURNING ITON THERE YET RIGHT SO AM YOU KOW I THINK WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCE THIS A YOU KNOW WERE STRESSE WERE STRESS WE A DOESN'T A SILY EVEN HAVE TO BE HIGHLY PROCESSED YOU KNOW A FATISOS BE NO FATY CARBAHYDRATES A YOU KNOW LIKE PETAOCHIPSAN AN TACHIPS IN DIPPER THESE KINDS OF THINGS IT CAN ALSO BE A BOLORIZABLE OR MALBLE POSSA AM WHICH HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO DEMONIZE A CARBHYDRAS I I DO INJUST CARAHYDRATES A MINMALYAR NON PROCESS CARBAHYDRATES A MOST OF THE TIME BUT NOT ALL THE TIME AND THEY HAVE A A FAIRLY POTENT A EFFECT ON UNLOWERING STRESS AND PERCEIVE STRESS AND EVEN QUALITY OF SLEEP WHICH IS NOT SAY THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO LOWD UP ON THEM LIKE CRAZY UNLESS THEIR GLICAGEN IS REALLY TO PLEATED I TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS IN THE ENDURANCE EPISODE I KNOW WILL TOUCH ON IT MORE IN THE NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTATION EPISODE BUT AM IN THINKING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CARBAHYDRATES AND CORTESALL AND WHAT WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT TERMS OF CORTES ALL AS BEENG VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE ADAPTATION TRIGGER ERE TRIGGERING ADAPTATION SPRONTLY BETTER WAY TO PUT IT BUT THAT IT CAN BLUND CORTIS ALL TAKEN POST TRAINING OR A MAY BE IN THE EVENING BEFORE SLEEP WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BASIC WAYS THAT ONE CAN THINK ABOUT AND MAYBE USED CARBAHYDRATES IN SPECIFIC WAYS IN ORDER TO BIT'S A CONTROL CORT IS ALL RATHER THAN A QUASH CORTESALL A YOU ACTUALLY HAVE ALLUDED TO A NUMBER OF TIMES RATY SO WE OFTEN TIMES WILL GIVE PEOPLE LOT OF CARBOHYDRATES AT NIGHT A FOR SOME OF THESE REASONS YOU'ARE GOING TO FEEL FANTASTIC A LOT OF PEOPLE TAT HELPS YOU SLEEP I'M BOTH GET TO SLEEP AND SAYASLY SO QUALITY YOU TALKED ABOUT SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER THINK ABOUT THIS WAY CORTUS ALL AT ITS CORE IS AN ENERGY SIGNALING MOLICUL IT SAYS WE ARE IN THE NEED FOR ENERGY GRIT A AT PANEFERENCE THE SAME WAY YOU YEEL START SEEING FOR EXAMPLE CORTISALL WILL LIBERATE A FREEFADIASITS PUT HIM N THE BLOODSTREAM GET YOU PREPARED TO DO SOMETHING THE PROBLEM IS IF IT'S CONTINUALLY ELEVATED THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITH NO DOWN REGULATION WE START RUNNING INTO ISSUES RIGHT SO AGAIN THIS IS THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN ALL MY CORTISALL SLIGHTLY ELEVATED ALL DAY VERSES I HAD A REALLY BIDS BIG SPIKE AFTER TRAINING I HAD A REALLY BIG SPIKE AFTER A BRETHPOTA CALLS CETERA AND THEN WENT BACK DOWN SO THAT BEING SAID IF YOU THEN IN JEST CRBOHYDRATES YOU ARE TELL IT IS QUICK TO SEE THE SIGNAL ALE WE HAVE NEUTRANCE WE HAVE ENERGY AGAIN SPECIFICALLY CARBOHYDRATES THEREFORE CORTISALL CAN SOR TO GO BACK DOWN WE DON'T NEED TO BE LIBERATING FREE PHADIACIDS AND PREPARING A THEIN FOR FEEL SO YOU CAN HELP YOURSELF GO TO SLEEP FOR MANY AS YOU POINTED OUT MANY MECHANISMS ACTUALLY F WHY CARBOHYDRATES WILL HLP YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT I'M FOR SOME NOT ALL PEOPLE BUT SOME THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AT HAS WITH CORTESAL GREAT I LOOK FORWAR TO HEARING MORE ABOUT HOW THE VARIOUS MACRONUTRIANS AND MICR IN UTRIANTS AND SO CALLED ADAPTED ONS THIS VERY MYSTERIOUS CRUP WE COMPOUNDS E ANOTHER WORD ADAPTED EN GETS THROWN AROUND SO MUCH T IS BUT AS LONG AS WRE TIKG ABOUT ADAPTATION I THINK O THAT'LL BE FAIR PLAY FOR THE A DISCUSSION IN THE NEXT EPISODE ABOUT NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION IN MY LABORATORY WHEN WE STUDY STRESS WE USE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MARKERS SUBJECTIVE REPORTS OF HOW STRESSE PEOPLE FEEL A HEARTRATES MORNING HEARTRATES HEARTRIT VERYABILITY CORT IS ALL FREE CORTES ALL AND ON AND ON WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER MARKYRS OF STRESS AS IT RELATES TO EXERCISE ADAPTATIONS AND RECOVERY BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN I THINK WERE SEEIN A LOT OF PARALLELS BETWEEN THE STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND THE STUDY OF PHYSICAL STRESS AS IT RELATES TO EXERCISE ADAPTATION REMEMBER INTRIMS OF PHYSIOLOGY STRESS IS STRESS THIS IS WHY WE HAVE THIS COOL TERM OF ALESTATIC LOAD OR ALISASIS SUCH THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHICH SYSTEM YOU TEST FOR IT WILL REFLECT OVER ALL STRESS A YOU MET ME MENTIONED SEVERAL OF THEM WE'VE GOT DONE TALKING ABOUT SOME BILE MARKERS ATRARVY AN HARRAT ARE ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUS S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS THIS WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MUSCLE SORNESS THING WE WERE REALLY GETTING AT WAS A MARKER OF HOW TO I FIX THEA OVERUSE IN THAT PARTICULAR MUSCLE NOW WE'VE REALLY TRANSITION INTO GLOBAL MARERS OV OVERYOUS AND WHY THESE ARE PROBLEMATIC OR IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO RATHER IS AGAN THESETY INDICATORS T A YOU DIDN' JUS WORK A MUSCLE OUT TOO HARD BUT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING WERE YOU'VE COMPROMISED ALL OF YOUR PHYSIOLOGY TO A LEVEL WHERE YOU'VE INFLUENCED A CIRCULATING CATICOLAMEAN OR  SOMETHING LIKE'S GOING TO INFLUENCE MULTIFUL MARKERS NOW LIKE YOUR SLEEP IN YOUR MOOD IN YOUR BEHAVIOR SO THAT'S WHY THESE SEEMS ARE PROBLEMATIC THAT'S SAID YOU COULD LOOK AT RESTING HEART RATE NOT A BAD THING TO DO HOWEVER TAT DOES HAVE MULTIPLE DOWNSIDES ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS YOU RESTING HART RATE WILL ELEVATE WITH EXCESSIVE STRESS SLOAE THIS ACTUALLY DOESN'T MATTER IF IT IS PHYSICAL STRESS OR PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS OR A COMBINATION SO YOU WILL SEE THAT NUMBER DRIFT UP OVER TIME HERE'S THE DOWNSIDE THOUGH IT'S NOT TREMENDOUSY SENSITIVE TO SMALLER STRESSERS INOTHER WORDS IF YOU WERE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE ALCOHOLES A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE YOU WILL SEE YOUR RESTING HEART RATE ELEVATE WITH ALCHOLHO USE AM EXCESS OFE TOBACCO USE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS HOWEVER IF YOU DO SOMETHING SMALL OR LIKE A HARD TRAINING SESSIONS RESTING HARRIGTE'S NOT SENSIT ENOUGH TO PICK THAT UP IT WILL ACTUALLY PROBABLY STAY THE SAME SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE DON'T ACTUALLY USE RESTING HEART RATE THAT MUCH WE WILL TAKE IT BUT IT'S NOT OUR PRIMARY INDICATOR THAT BEING SAID H ARVY IS A VETTER USE SO JUST WEAR TH QUICKLY FOR THOSE ARE NOT FAMILIAR A YOUR HEART RATE LESS SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU YOUR RESTING HEART RATEIS SIXTY BEATS PERMENENT THAT MEANS EVERY SECOND IT'S BEATING ITDOESN'T ACTALY HAPPEN ON A CONSISTENT RHYTHM SUCH THAT IT WOULD BEAT ON SECOND ONE BEAT ON SECOND TOO BEAT ON SECOND THREE ET CETERA THE RATE IS MORE VARIABLE SO A MIGHTAL BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT THERE'S AR VARIATION IN THE HEART RATE AND AT THE END OF THAT SIXTY SECONDS IN THIS EXAMPLE YOU WOULD AVE STILL COMPLETEED SIXTY BEATS THEY IS ARNT ON EXACT SAME PATTER WILL ONE THING THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE INTERESTING IS THE A MOUNT OF VARIATION IN YOUR HEART RATE IS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR OVER ALL SYMPATHETIC OR PARA SYMPATHETIC STATE SUCH THAT A LARGE VARIATION SO AN A RHYTHMIC PATTERN IS GENERALLY MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF BEING MORE RESTED AND RECOVERED IN BEING MORE PARS SYMPATHETIC A YOU'LL NOTICE DURING TIMES OF EXTREMELY HIGH STRESS  YOU WILL BE VERY RHYTHIC BEAT BEAT BEAT BEAT BE AND SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A CONFUSING IDEA BUT A HIGH AH ARBAT IS THERE INDICATED OF A LOT OF VARIATION MEANING YOURE PRETTY RECOVERED A LOW AH AR BEA MEANING THERE'S NOT ALOT OF VARIATION MEANS YOUR PROBABLY PRETTY STRESSED AND WIRE SO ITS IS A RELATED TO HEART RATE BUT IN MY OPINION IS A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER MARKER OF THAT NOW ONE THING YOU WANTO PAY ATTENTION TO IF YOU DO THIS A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE ARE SOME ACCURACY ISSUES WITH MANY THE DEVICEIS BASELY EVERYBODY AT THIS POINT PROBABLY HAS SOME DEVICE A THAT'S TELLING THEM THEIR H ARV WHAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO IS SIMPLY COMPARE YOUR NUMBER TO SOMEBODY ELSE FOR A LOT OF REASONS NOT ALL OF THESE ACNOWLEGIES ARE ACTUALLY EVEN MEASURING THE SAME THING I AGAINST SOME OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY COMBINING WITH OTHER MECTRICS AND CALLING AT YOU'RE OVER ALL READINESS OR YOUR RECOVERY AND SO NOW W WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE IS MADE A COUPLE OF ASSUMPTIONS AN THE STACK THEM ON A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AND THE GAVIN YOU IN NUMBER AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SORT OF BLACK BLOX SCORE ACTUALLY IN REPRESENT SO I WOULD CAUTION ONE AGAINST TAKING TOO MUCH A INFORMATION FROM THAT IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY MEASURING  ARV EVEN WITHIN THAT THERE'S A LOSS OF WAYS TO CALCULATE IT THAT ARE NOT IMPORTANT HERE SO DON'T NECESSARILY WORRY ABOUT THE SCORE WHEN CON  COMPARE IT TO YOURSELF BUT NOT TO OTHERS WHAT YOU WILL SEE AS IF YOU USE SIMILAR DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES YE IS HARD TO FIND DAY TO HERE BUT IN GENERAL PEOPLE THAT ARE A OVER WEIGHT I  MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A LOWER SCORE AS IN A WORST SCORE A WE NEED MORE IN FORMATION ON THAT TO BE CLEAR SO IN LARGE PART THE BEST WAY TO USE SOMETHING LIKE H ARV IS TO MEASURE IT UNDER THE EXACTIN CIRCUMSTANCES EVERY DAY SO WHETHER YOU GOING TO USE A JUST A DEVICE A ON YOUR WATCH OR YOUR PHON OR YOUR BED OR ANYTHING ELSE OR YOU CAN BUY A SPECIAL AHAR UNDER ITS FINE JUST TAKE THAT MEASURE AF THE SAME TIME A MOSTLY THIS MEANS FIRST THINGIN THE MORNING SO YOU WAKE UP YOU GO THE BATH WHEN YOU COME BACK DOWN AND TAKE YOUR MEASURE SOMEHI THAT YOU DON'T WHAT SOMETIMES YOU TOOK IT BEFORE FOOD THAN AFTER YOUR LOOK YOUR PHOWN LIKE ALL THSE OTHER THINGS TI CAN INFLUENCE RES SO SO D TAKE AT N'T USUALLY TAKE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SECONDS SOME MINUTES TO RECORD SO YOU WANTO PAY TON KNOW THAT NOW ONE THINGS YOU'LL NOTICE IS THERE IS A NATURAL CHANGE IN YOUR H AR VT JUST HAPPENS AND SO WHAT YOU CANNO REALLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO IS I GUESS ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH OF A CHANGE IN H ARV HAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE I SHOULD CARE ANDIT'S HARD TO ANSWER RIGHT SO LET'S TO SAY YOUR AH ARVE WAS A HUNDRED I DISMAY THAT NUMBER OF WHAT IF YOU WAKE UP TO MOROW ITS NINETY NINE WHAT'S THAT MEAN WE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WAKE UP TO MORROW IN IT'S TWENTY THAT'S PROBABLY A BAD THING WHERE'IS THAT LINE IT'S HARD ONE THING I WOUL RECOMMEND DOING IS TAKING YOUR H AR B FOR AT LEAST A MONTH BEFORE YOU START USING THAT VALUE TO MAKE ANY CHANGES AND YOU RE COMMEND TAKING AT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING YET ALWAYS ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME BASELY UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TECKING IN THE MORNING BUT BECAUSE YOUR DAY WE'LL CHANGE ON MOST DAYS OF WI GET INTO A THAT'S THE MOST STABLE THING IN YOUR LIFE SO I WOULD TAKE IT THEN AND I WOULD COLLECT IT FOR LEAST A DAY AT LEAST A MONTH ORATHER MAYBEVEN SIX WEEKS AND THEN GIVE YOURSELF BASECY RUNNING AVERAGE SO  WHAT WE  QUINE ONESTLY DO IS A WE WILL ACTUALLY TRACK IT FOR FOR EVER AND THEN WHAT WE ALWAYS LOOK AT IS WHAT ISIT LIKE TO DAY RELATIVE TO THE LAST WEEK ON AVERAGE AND WHAT'S THAT LOOK LIKE TO OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGE AND WE ALWAYS COMPARE THOSE THINGS AND YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU COMPARE LIKE TO LIKE SONE OTHER WORDS I GENERALLY WEN NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT TO DAYS H ARBYSCORE RELATIVE TO TO MORROWS WHAT I WANT A LOOK AT IS TO DAYS RELATIVE TO THIS EXACTSIME DAY LAST WEEK I'M NOT FOR OUT THITS BUT FOR NON OUT THAT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANTE SO IMAGINE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN H ARBYSCORE N MONDAY COMPARE TO TUESDAY PAY ATTENDION TO MONDAY COMPARED THE LAST MONDAY AND THE MONDAY BEFORE THAT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU TYPICALLY HAVE THE SAME SORT OF WEEKLY SCHEDRUL AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS OU SAY LOOK AT MONDAYS  H ARV SCORE WHICH IS A REFLECTION OF WHAT HAPPENED SUNDAY AND COMPARE THAT TO TUESDAYS WHICH IS ACTUALLY REFLECTION WHAT HAPPENED MONDAY YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T DO THE SAME STRESSORS ON SUNDAY IS MONDAYS WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY COPARIN THE SAME THING BUT IF YOU HAVE A GENERAL WEEKLY SCHEDUAL YOU LIKELY TO COMPARE THIS MONDAYS RELET TO LAST MONDAYS BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH COMPARING WHAT HAPPEN ON THE PREVIOUS DAYSI I DID THAT SORT OF DISTINCTION MAKES SENSE ABSOLUTELY I DO THE STANDING WITH BODY WEIGHT BY THE WAY IF YOUR TRYING TO TRACT BODY MASCAN OR FAT LOSS OR SOMETHING  COMPARE LIKE THE LIKE YOU CAN LOOK AT THE DAILY CHANGES BUT YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION O WHAT THAT NORMWAL DISTRIBUTION IS SO IF YOU CONTO DO THAT YOU KNOW MONDAY TO MONDAY THING THAT'LL GIVE YOU A ROUGH ARIA OF SAYING O K MY NORMAL WEEKLY VARIATION IS SAV FIVE SO MY AVERAGE IS ONE HUNDRED BUT I WILL FLUCTUATE BETEEN NINETY FIVE TO ONE OR FIVE THAT'S MY STANDARD DEVIATION IS SO O A SCIENCE DORKS WOULD CALL THAT IF YOU START VERY A CHANGING MORE THAN FIVE PER CENT OUTSIDE OF YOUR NORMALSTANTARDEVIATION THEN I'M MUT A START PAYING ATTENTION A LITTLE BIT AND I'M AN ACTULE RUN A LITTLE BIT AN ALGARITHM ON THIS ONE AND SO HERE IS MY THINKING PROCESS WHEN I GET A ATHRE OUREALLY ANY METRIC BUT ATR V EAS IS EXAMPLER EUSING FIRST STEP DID I COLLECT GOOD DATA AND BY THAT I MEAN AGAIN DID I MEASURE THE SAME WAY I MEASURED EVERY SINGLE DAY OR DID I GET UP AND LOOK AT MY PHONE FIRST AND I REALIZED OLD CRAP I FORGOT TO TAKE MY ATARV AND THEN I WENT BACK NEITHER SO SAY I HAD A FIFTEEN PERCENT DERIVATION FROM MY NORMAL NUMBER AND THET I REALIZED OH YE THAT'S RIGHT I WAS A SUPERLATE LAST NIGHT DOING WHATEVER O KET GRET I'M LET AT CONSIDER THAT BAD DATA YOU DIDN'T GOOD IT IT'S BAD DAY THAT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING IGNORE BAT DAT YOU THROWIT OUT YOU DO'T USE IT IF YOU DECIDE FOR THE MOST BARTLESSES SUME IT WAS GOOD DATA O KEGRA THN I'M GOING ON TO MY NEXT QUECTION WHICH IS IS IT ACUTE AND THERE WAS IS IT JUST TO DY RIGHT OR IS IT CHRONIC AS REAS THIS IS IT IS THIS PATTERN BEN HAPPENING FOR MORE THAN FIVE DAYS OR AT LEAST THREE HAD THE LAST FORE OR SOMETHNG LIKE THAT THREE MENIMUM IS WHAT I LIKE HONESTLY I GJENT LOOK AT FIVE OR MORE DAYS THAT'S A VERY BIG DISTINCTION IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED TO DAY AND THE NEXT QUESTION IN WHEN I ASK MYSELF IS AN IT IN THAT ADAPTATION THINGS AN MI TRYING TO BE IN A PHASE WE OUND TRYING TO CAUSE AN INSULTS TO THE BODY THAT IT NEEDS RESPOND WITHIF THAT IS THE CASE I'M JUST GON IGNORE IT IN FACT IT'S ALMOST SOMETIMES A GOOD TINE HEY WE ARE STRESSING THE BODY AND IT IS STRESSED WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WORKING AMASING IN FACT IF YO DON'T SEE THAT A SORT OF LIKE MOON MA WOEERE NOT DO NOT TO BUSH THE PASE IM SOR GRAT IF THE ANSWER IS NO WHERE IN A PIKING PHASE THEN WE'RE ACTUAY GIN TO USE WHAT I CALL ACUTE STATE SHIFTERS SO TH IS HA WHOLE WHOST OF LITTLE TRICKS THAT I HAVE THAT CAN CHANGE H R V OR ANY RECOVERYG METRIC WITHIN SECONDS AGAIN THESE ARE NOT CHRONIC FIXES THIS IS JUST I'M HAVING A BAD DAY TO DAY I FEEL LIKE CRAP CAN I MAKE MYSELF FEEL BETTER RIGHT NOW AND SO I CANN'T CALL THESE PARLOR TRICKS A LOT OF THE TIMES AND THERE'S A THE THOUSAND OF THEM WE ARE STEALING I CON GOVETHAM BUT I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES I'M YOU CAN PULL OUT FIRST WHALL PHYSICAL MOVEMENT WILL DO YOU B BE STUNNED HI'LL JUST DOIN SOME YOGA MOVING AROUND AND SOME JUMPING JACKS STARTING YOUR WORK OUT YOU MEAN YOUVE PROBABLY EXPERIENCE THIS IS SORT OF CLICHET AND OR WORLD THIS POINT BUT I'M IF YOU EVER DO ANY SERIOUS LIFTING OVER SERIOUS OM MAT TIME THERE WILL BE DAYS WHEN WHICH YOU WALK IN THE JEM AND YOU FEEL AWFUL AND SOMEHOW THAT DAY YOU SENT A LIFETIME PIAR YE THAT'S A STRANGE STRANGE PHENOMENA EA I EXPERIENCE THAT MORE THAN A FEW TIMES IM IT'S RARE THE INIVERSE IS RARE HOWEVER YOU FEEL GREAT YOUHAVE A HORRIBLE WORK OUT IT HAPPENS YEIMAN IT EXAPEN FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS BUT Y I THINK THE THE FORMER WHEN ONE ISN'T FEELING VERY GOOD AND THEN SOMEHOWS IT A TERRIFIC WORK OUT DOES SET A KIND OF A SEED OF DOUBT ASS TO HOW GOOD OUR SUBJECTIVE ASSASSMEN IS REALLY ARE I MICH I GUESS IS WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IM OBJECTIVE A SESSMENTS YE LIKE A SHARBY AND REMEMBER IF IT'S A SINGLE DAY HERE AYOU CAN EVEN DO HARD TRAINING A PEOPLE SORT OF HVE THIS IDEA LIKE WELL IF YOU GET UP IN YOUR RECOVERY SCOURSE DOWN DO A LIGHTER DAY TAT'S PROBING IT OT LIKE CAN PROBING NEVER MAKE IN THAT CHOICE TO BE HONEST NOT IN THE SITUATION REMEMBER THIS IS ONE BAD DAY AND WE ARE IN A PHASE OF EVEN TRYING TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE RIGHT NOW LIKE WERE PROBABLY STILL TRAINING HARD YOU WILL AGAIN OFTEN SEE I FELT TERRIBLE WHEN I TRAIN SUPERHARD AND IT TOTALLY CHANGE MY DAY AROUND THIS ALL CAN HAPPEN TO EXERCISES MY FIRST LOVE HERE I'M ABSOLUTELY BREATHING ANY SORT OF UPREGULATION BREATHING SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT DOWN REGULATION BREATHING JUST DO THE OPPOSITE AND SO THIS IS WHONE HYPER VENTILATION STRATEGIES CAN WORK INSTEAD OF ACCENTUATING THE EXHALE YOU ECCATUATE THE IN HALE RYOU WRE STRICT THE EXHALS THIS  WORKING IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE SITUATION YOU CAN ALSO PLAY LITTLE THIS IS WORE THINGS LIKE MUSIC MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES IF YOU'RE THE TYPE THAT FOLLOWS PEOPLE ON INSTRIGAND THAT MOTIVATES YOU OR CAN WORK OF THESE THINGS I'M COACHING TACTICS THESE CAN BE THINGS LIKE I'M FINDING OUT OR TALKING ABOUT THAT PERSONS WHY IM YOU SORT OF SHARE SOMETHING THAT AMONTRE YOU USE WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING HARD TO KEEP YOU GO BETTER I'M WHEN I CAN ASK YOU TO SHARE THAT NOW BUT SOME B OPLE HAVE THIT SOMETIMES RIGHT OR YOU MAY HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOUR ATLING THAT WE WE CALL THIS FINDING OUT YOUR WHY RIGHT SO FINANT LIKE WHY YOU REALLY HERE WHAT LL BE DOING HERE AND A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL HEAR THINGS LIKE IT'S BECAUSE I GROW UP POOR NOT O VER WONT O BE POOR O'LL GAGRA OR THIS IS FOR MY CHILDREN OR LK ANY NUMBER OF THINGS  YOU CAN PULL THAT OUT ON THESE DAYS YOU NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL THIS WHY CALL THESE PARLOR TRICKS BECAUSE WHEN YOU PLAY THAT CARD TOO OFTEN IT'S SORC TO LOSE A FACT RIGHT AND YOU CAN ONLY DIG TO A WHOLE SO OFTEN BEFORE IT'S SORT LIKE I'M THE SAME THING AS WITH MUSIC RIGHT IF YOU EVERY TIME YOU GO THE WAIT ROOM IT'S BLASSING DEAF METAL AT LEVEL TEN WILL EVENTUALLY IT'S NOT IN THIS NO LONGER MOTIVATING RIGHT IS NO LONGER HELPFUL SO IM YOU WANT O TE PLOY THESE THINGS STRITEGIC YEO THET THE PHRASIT COMES TO MIND IS SIGNALD THE NOISE YOU KNOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AN SPECIALLY THE DOPEMEAN SYSTEM AND THE EDDRERNAL AND SYSTEM WHICH ARE PART OF THIS LARGER SYSTEM CALL THE CATACOLOMING SYSTEMS THATS JOPENMING EPINAFOR NOROPAN EFFRON THE THEY GET UP AND GO FOR CASON EXTERNAL GOALS A MOVEMENT ASSOCIATED ITS ANORANON THAT THAT SYSTEM RESPONDS BEST TO HIGH SIGNAL A RELATIVE TO NOISE SO IF YOUR AS YOU POINT OUT I'M LISTENING MUSIC EVERY CIME TRICKING A CON OF CAFING ENERGY DURINGS PRE WORK OUT A NEUTROPICS AND THEN YOU STACKING ALL THOSE THINGS A SOMETIMES REFER THIS IS DOPEMIN STACKING  CAN FORMALLY REFER TO ITS JOPENING SACKING YOU'RE DOING ALL THOSE THINGS THEN YOUAT FIRST ALL THEN YOU'RE WONDERING WHY A LATER THAT AFTERNOON OR THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE FEELING LIKE YOUR YOU'RE UNDER A CLOUD IT WA'S OBVIOUSYOUR YOUR CATACOLMAN SYSTEM CRASH BUT IT'S ALSO THAT A'M YOU DON'T ASSURELY BECOME DEPENDENT ON IT IT'S JUST THAT YOU START TO WONDER WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE THE INTERNAL MECHANISMS AND MOTIVATION TO TRAIN WITHOUT THOSE THINGS AND SO ONE TENSE USE THEM MORE OR MORE THAN THEY HAVE A DIMINISHING EFFECT OVER TIME TINK A THE RULE THAT I'VE BEEN A SORT OF APPLYING HAS BEEN I NEVER DO TO WORK OUTS IN A ROW WER I'M STACKING IN A STIMULANTE LOUD MUSIC AND ANY KIND OF A HASORT OF HIGH POTENCY INSPIRATION HOWEVER EVERY SET IN THE GIM OR WHEN I RUN I REALLY TRYIN BE DILIGENT ABOUT FORM AN ATTENTION TO WHAT I'M DOING THE ONE EXCEPTION WOULD BE THE LONG DERATION ENDURANCE WORK PART OF THE REASON I DO THAT WORK IS TO LET MY MIND GO INTO STATES OF DRIFTING I I'M NOT TRYNG TO THINKING  COMPLETE SENTENCES OR EVEN CLOSE TO IT JUST LET MY MY BRING KIND OF IDLE AT AT A LOW HUM AH AND FOR THAT REASON GENERALLY LISTEN TO SOME THING THAT'S U MORE OF A STORY OR DON'T LISTEN'T ANYTHING AT ALL AND JUST LET MY THOUGHTS KIND OF SCHOOL THROUGH ANYWAY I DON'T NOT TAKE US TOO FAR OFF TRACK BUT I THINK THIS A I DEA OF SIGNAL TE NOISE WILL RESINATE WITH THE ENGINEERS OUT THERE BUT SINCE MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKELY NOT ENGINEERS IT IS THE WAY THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS AM EVIDENCE BY THE FACT THAT WHATEVER AIR OF YOUR BODY WRIGHT NOW IS IN CONTACT WITH A CHAIR OR I'M ANY OTHER SURFACE THAT'S BEEN IN CONTACT WITH FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS YOU FORGET THAT IT'S IN CONTACT WITH IT AS THERE'S LOW SIGNAL THE NOISE AT THAT POINT SIMILAR NOTE YOU ACTUALLY MENTION STIMULAN SPACELY THERE WHET THEY ARE TALKING CAFI EAN OR ANY OTHER STIMULANT ANY OTHER CORTESALL MODULATORS ARE ADAPTED INS ANY O THESE THINGS FALL IN THE CATEGORY IF YOU'RE NOT USING THEM CONSISTENTLY ANYOURE HAVING A ROUGH DAY AND ALL SON YOU THROW DOWN TO INTER MELEGRAMS OF KAFFIN IT'S GOING TO CHANGE REAL FAST THE OT TA STRONG PERFORMANCE ANCING EFFECT YE ABSOLUTE AND FOR THESE REASONS FRT I'MSO WE MENTION A COUPLE OF EMBROTH WORK IM FOOD MORE CALORIES JUST EATING SOME FOOD I SOMETIMES WILL GIVE PEOPLE LIKE COUPWLE BECALL COMPORFOODS SO THIS IS JUST LIKE HEY YOUR A YOU KNOW YOURE FROM GEORGIA AND WE KNOW YOU LOVE GRITS SO E'RE HAVING GRITS FOR BREAKFAST OH MY GRAY LIKE JUS SOMETHING TO CHANGE OR MOOD ACUTE STATESHIFTERS I'M TO ALTER IT THE OTHER COUPLE OF TRICKS HERE ARE LIGHT SO IF WE KNOW THAT MAY BE SEE MOLT WOLD PEOPLE STRUGGLING THAT DAY MAY BE WILL PUT ON THE LIGHTS EXTRAPRITE WILL BRING US SOME ACTOR THINGS AN JUST GET IT MORE LIGNTLYREI NOT THET THEN ACCOUNT ACTUALLY GOING OUTSIDE AND SEENG THE SUN BUT PERHAPS WILL DO THAT I AND THEN OTHER LITTLE TRICKS THAT I'VE LEARND OVER TE YEARS IS A ONE PARTICULAR THING I LOVE IS LITTLELY DRAWING A LINE A PHYSICAL LINE ON THE GROUND AND YOU LOOK AT THAT LINE AND YOU SAY LIKE I'M GOING TO TRAIN TODAY AND I'M GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS EFFORT I'M NOT GOING TO WALK PAST THIS LINE AND INTO THAT TRAINING SPACE UNSIL I 'M READY TO GIVE THAT EFFORT AND THAT MAY TAKE A MINUTE OR TEN OR WHATEVER BUT IT IT IT'S THE PHYSICAL BARRIER IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SAYING LIKE I'M NOT DISTGONTO GET THROUGH IT I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY PERFORM THE WAY I WANT TO PERFORM OR I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AND I'M NOT GING ACROSS THIS LINE UNSI I'M READY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN I I REALLY LIKE THAT TOOL IT ALSO AP BRINGS TO MINE THE IMPORTANCE OF AT LEAST THINKING ABOUT HOW YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR PHONE DURING TRAINING I'M CAN PERHAPS HELP BUT ALSO IMPEDE WORK OUT MOTIVATION IN PERFORMANCE IN AN EARLIER EPISODE YOU MENTION THAT IF PEOPLE ARE USING THEIR PHONE TO PLAY MUSIC DURING THEIR WORK OUT THAT THEY ESTABLISH THE COMPLETE PLAYLIST PRIOR TO INITIATING THE WORK OUT AND THE NOT DEVIATE FROM THAT PLAYLIST A SUPPOSED TO CHANGING IT IN THE MIDDLE BE CAUSIUST TOO MUCH OF A A OF AN IMPULSE TO ALSO CHECK SO SHOMEDIA CHE EMALE CHECTECTS MESSAGES INTHE WAY I THINK ABOUT THE PHONE ACTUALLY IS IT A BUNCH OF THEM A BRAIN AREAS IT'S GOT A MEMORY SYSTEM FOR YOU IT'S GOT LOOK UP TABLES FOR AT LOOK UP TABLE IT'S GOT WEBSIDES TO LOOK THINGS UP ON THE INNER NET IT'S GOT PHODOS AN MIT IS SO RICH WITH SENSRY DATA AND IT SO CLOSELY LINK TO OUR OWN BRAIN ARCHITECTURE THE ALGARISMS ARE DESIGNE OMFORT THOSE TO BE THAT WAY THAT I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IT AS BRINGING IN A SECOND PERSON WITH ME BUT THAT PERSON IS IT MY TWIN THAT I'M HAS SEVERE ATTENTION ISSUES AND FOR THOSE THAT ALREADY HAVE ATTENTION ISSUES JUST THINK ABOUT THIS IS A A TWIN THAT WITHIN COMPOUND YOU BY TAPPING ON YOUR SHOULDER TALKING T YOU ALL THE TIME INTERRUPTING YOU I'S SOMEBODY THT YOU LIKE THA LOT BUT THAT FRANKLY IS U'M IS A LIL BE IRRITATING IN THAT THEIR THEIR INTERRUPTING YOUR ABILITY TO REA LY SHOW UP AND ALSO YOURABILITY TO SHOW UP FOR THEM SO I YOU STARTE TO THING ABOUT THE FHONE AS A ENTIRE INDIVIDUAL AND THAT RE PRESENTS ME AND UNCERTAINLY A NOT THE BETTER VERSION OF ME EXACTLY YOU ACTUALLY MENTION SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL USE A OCCASIONALIY WHICH A WOILL BE CALL BRAIN GAMES OR PUZZLES WHETHER THIS IS A CROSSWORD PUZZLE OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU ACTUALLY LOSE YOUR THOUGHT OF SELF FOR SECOND AND YOUR BRAIN GIS ENGAGED IN A TASK THAT YOU WAREN'T REGRETTING OR EVEN THINKING ABOUT THESE CAN BE STUPID LITTLE GAMES IT COULD BE LITTLE CHALLENGE S ESPECIALLY FR LIKE A GROUP OR TEAM SETTING I LIKE WORK A PLAY ONE ROUND OF DOGEBAL OR WEREN TO PLAY ONE ROUND OF O THUMB WORS SO YOU DO ENCOURAGE THIS YE I SAY SO YOU WOULD PLAY LIKE A THING AS SED OF WARMING UP SIC AI GETTING AR WILL GET GOING ER YOUNT GET YOUR FOMERALL OR YOUR DINENT WHATEVER THINGS IS LIKE OUR EVERYONE LINE UP AND WERE TO PLAY THUMB RORS TO SEE WH WHENS RI JUST LIKE WHATEVER RIGNT ALSO YOU'VE SNAPPED INTO A NEW MANT SHIFT A OR LITERALLY PLAYING BRAIN GAMES PLAYING TATRES ON YOUR FONE LIKE ANY THESE THINES AM CAN WORK IN THIS ACUTE SETTING CAN ASK YOUR QUESTION IT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO RECOVERY A PERSE SAY BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH MENTIONING AM OR ASKING ABOUT RATHER WHICH IS THE USE OF MIRRORS OR NO MIRRORS WHILE TRAINING M YOU KNOW THE EXPERIENCE OF SEEN ONESELF AND OBSERVING ONE'S FORM IN THE MIRROR I SUPPOSE HAS SOME UTILITY YOU CAN GET SOME SENSE OF PROGRESS THAT YOU MY TRIGGER AM IS YOUARE ALMOST SPICICALLY REFERRING TO A RESISTANCE TRAINING SUPPOSE IT COULD BE CARD YO IF YOUR RUNNING ON A TREAD MILL OR PUSHING A SLADDER SOMETHING BUT AM YOU CAN SEE FORM AM YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF AM WHAT YOUR FACE LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU GRIMACE  BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS AM YOU ARE WITHOUT QUESTION A PERSON NOT YOU ANDY BUT AM ONE IS IN A LESS INTERECEPTIVE MODE WHEN LOOKING AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR SO T EXTRARECEPTION PERPERCEPTION OF THINGS BEYOND THE CONFINES OF OUR SKIN EVEN IF IT'S A PICTURE OF US INTERECEPTION PERCEPTION AF EVERYTHING FROM THE SKIN INWARD A AND SO IF WERE LOOKING AT OURSELVES WE'RE DIVERTING SOME ALOCATION OF OUR ATTENTION LET' SAY THERE'S A HUNDRED THESE ARARBITRARY UNITS AND YOU CAN THPUT FIFTY PERCENT OF YOUR ATTENTION ON THE FEELING IN YOUR BODY OR THE MUSCLES YOUR TRAINING AM IN FIFTY PERCENT ON HOW IT APPEARS IN THE MIRROR OR IT COULD BE A HUNDER PERCENT ON THE MIRROR HUNDER PER CENT INTERNALLY WHICH YOU BEST ACCOMPLISH FOLLY BY CLOSING YOUR EYES NSO OBVOUSLY THEIR CONSTRAINES HERE CERTAIN MOVEMENTS YOU WOULDN'T ANT TO CLOSE YOUR EYES ET CETERA IN GENERAL WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON MIRRORS OR NO MIRRORS FOR RESISTANCE TRAINING SPECIFICALLY IT DEPENDS ON THE METRIC THAT YOU FIND MOST IMPORTANT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS IF YOU'RE TRAINING FOR SAM MUSCLE HIGH PERCHIF EITHERS EMERGING EVIDENCE TAT SUGGESTS A ACTUALLY LOOKING AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND EVEN FLEXING IN BETWEEN SETS AM CAN ACTUALLY BE ADVANTAGEOUS OR CAN AUGMENTS MUSCLE GANE OH MY THERES A SUPPORT FOR ALL THE THE A MIRROR FLEXORS AHUBILY NOT OT MAKING FUN OF YOU I JUST ATHIS IS SOR INTERESTING TO BE ON THE OBSERVING SIDE OF OF THAT BUT EY LISTEN RESULTS OR WHAT PEOPLE ARE AFTER YET HAVING SAID THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING INHANDS MOVEMENT LEARNING THEN IT MAY BE DETRIMENTAL SO IF YOU'RE DOING AN EXERCISE THAT IS EXPLOSIVE AND FAST IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST THING TO BE LOOKING IN A MIRROR I'M IF YOU WERE TO WALK INTO ANY ELYMPIC WAY LIFTING ARENA AND YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS OF USING A MIRROR YOU WOULD PROBABLY RUN OUT OF THE GYM VERY VERY QUICKLY YOU CAN'T SEE YOURSELF IN TIME TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT WITH THE MOVEMENT TATS HAPPENING THAT FAST AND ALSO WILL DO EXACTLY WHICH YOU MENTION WHICHIS IT WILL REMOVE YOUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND FEEL THE MOVEMENT AND SO THIS IS A BIG COMPONENT TO USING TECHNOLOGY FOR EXERCISE AT ALL IS YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE END POINT IS YOU UNDERSTANDING YOU AND YOUR PHYSIOLOGY MORE NOT LESS WHEN YOU HOUTSOURCE LEARNING TO TECHNOLOGY IN THIS CASE EVEN IT THE TECHNOLOGY IS THE MIRROR YOU REMOVE YOUR ABILITY TO GAIN AND TRULY UNDERSTAND THAT LEARNING PROCESS SO YOU NEED T BE VERY VERY CAREFOR WHETHER YOU USING A MIRROR OR WHETHER YOU USING ANY NUMBER OF APS WHERE YOU CAN RECORD SAY A MOVEMENT AND THEN WATCH IT AFTERWARDS AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A BREAK DOWN IF YOUR HAND WAS IN THE RIGHT SPOD OR IF IT WAS THE RY SPOT THESE ARE ALL GREAT BUT YOU NEED TO THEN TAKE THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS TO SAY I NEED TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT POSITION ISO IN THE CASE O PERFORMANCE IF YOU CAN IMAGINE TRYING TO LEARN A NEW TECHNIQUESAY RUNNING TECHNIQUE AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE WATCH YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR TO UNDERSTAND YOUR STRIDE IN MY POSITION IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE NEXT STEP OF SAYING UL CADE NOW I NDN'LL HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRR AND I CAN FEEL WHEN I'M GETTING OUT OF RHYTHM OR WHATEVER THE CASES THEN YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO ACTULLY THAN USE THAT IN YOUR RACE AND SO IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE AGAIN PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS THE DEPENDENT VARY WHILE THE YOU ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN DOING IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET BETTER AT SOMETHING THE TEC IS O CASE OF STARTING PLACE IT JUST CANNOT BE THE FINISHING PLACE THANK YOU FOR THOSE REFLECTIONS I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT HAPPENS OR WHAT ONE SHOULD DO IF THERE EACH AR V IS REDUCED FOR MAY BE THREE OR FOUR OR MORE DAYS IN A ROW ABSOLUTELY THE NEXT QUESTION THAN AMHEN I ASK IS GAIN AM I IN THAT ADAPTATION FACE IF SO I'M GOING TO STILL IGNORE IT JUST LIKE I DID IF IT WAS A SINGLE TAD DAY BUT I'M UN A START WATCHING IT VERY CAREFULLY I MAY ACTUALLY NOW I INTRODUCE SOME OTHER TESTS SO I MAY USE A PERFORMANCE TUS IMAY LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE MAY BE ASKED QUESTIONS MAY BE HAVE SOME COMMUNICATION EITHER WITH MYSELF FOR SOMEBODY ELSE SO I'MMIST OUR PAYING MORE ATTENTION BUT I'M STILL REALLY NOTKING TO TAKE MUCH ACTION AND TELL THAT CROSS IS MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS OF CONSISTENT PROBLEMS IM IF IT DOES DO THAT OR WERE IN A PIKING FACE THEN I'MON TO GOL TO A NOTHER SET OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE TRULY GOING TO PULL ME OUT OF THE WHOLE RATHER THAN JUST BE A THOSE ACUTE STATE SHIFTERS THESE OR MORE WHAT I CALL CHRONIC SAY SHIFTERS NOW SOME OF THESE ARE ACTUALLY VERY SIMIL R TO THE ONES WE'VE USED BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE THERMALSTRAS SO I CAN PROMISE YOU IF YOU'RE RECOVERY SCORE IS IN THE TANKS AND YOU WALK OUTSIDE AND YOU JUMP IN YOUR THIRTY FIVE DEGREE WATER AND YOU GET BACK OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOUR H R VSORE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AND I'M TALKING WITHIN SECONDS I'S GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISE RIGHT NOW ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THAT MEMBERA LOW H R V MEANS HIGH SYMPATHETIC I PROMISE YOU COLD WATER WELL PUS YOU IN A HIGH SYMPATHETIC DRIVE HOWEVER AND WE'VE TESTOD THIS PRETTY EXSTENSIVLY LOOKING AT A CHR V ZERO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIXTY NINETY ALL THEWAY UP TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES POST AND ON AVERAGE YOU WILL SEE YOUR H R VSCORE CONTINUE TO RISE AFTER THAT AND SO WELL YOU HAVE THIS IMMEDIATE SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY THEN RESPOND Y ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES ON MOST PEOPLE DEPENDS ON THE PERSONTHAL AND THAT SCORE WILL BE IMPROVED FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTERWARDS SO AHEAT CAN KIN HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT THAT ACTUALLY AGAIN AS AT IT'S SORT OF AN ACUTE FIX BUT OVER TIME AS WE'VE DESCRIBED EARLIER THAT CAN ALSO HAVE A LITLABIT OF A CHRONIC EFFECT WE CAN ALSO THEN GET INTO AREAS LIKE SLEEP AND SO NOW WER TO START PLAYING AND EXPLORING WY A ARE YOU SLEEPING POR AS WELL OR WAS YOUR SLEEP SCORE FINE BUT YOUR H R V WAS LOW THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ANSWER IF YOUR SLEEP IS GETTING COMPROMISE THAT RETOST AUR GOING IN TO IN MAKING SURE WE'RE IMPROVING OUR SLEEP A IN TERMS OF LIKE BRAINSTUFF INSTEAD OF MAY BE PLAYING A GAME OR HAVING MUSIC OR SOMETHNG S OTHER TRICK THOSE AREN'T GON A REALLY HAVE A CHRONIC EFFECT BUT YOU CAN DO THINGS LIKE WORK ON SOCIAL CONNECTION THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE A RECOVERY OVER TIME YOU CAN DO THINGS LIKE JOURNALING OR MEDITATION AND THOSE HAVE AN ACUTE EFFECT AS WELL AS A CHRONIC A FACTS SO AGAIN IF YOU GO JOURNAL RIGHT NOW YOU PROBABLY FEEL BETTER BUT ALSO WE KNOW THAT OVER TIME THAT WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE THINGS SO ADAPTIGINS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ALSO CAN HAVE A CHRONIC EFFECT SO CAN THINGS LIKE ELECTROLIGHTS OR FOOD OR HYDRATION IF THOSE THINGS WERE WERE OFF SO  WE'RE GONG TO GO TO A WHOLE NUMBER OF AREAS BUT THOSE OF THE PRIMARY ONES OUTSTANDING OF ALL THAT OF CURSE IT MAY BE SIMPLY A TIME TO GO BACK AND REASSESS AR TRAINING PROGRAM THAT'S TRULY THE CASE SO THAT'S WHAT WERE AT IF SO WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO EITHER COMPLETELY REMOVE TRAINING OR DROP AT THE LIKE FIFTY PER CENT OR SO UNTIL WE START REBOUNDING BACK TO BASE LINE THAT'S GENERALLY THE NUMBERS WE USE FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TRAINING FOR A COMPETIVE SPORT IT MAYBE AREN'T PUSHING THEMSELVES REALLY HARD YOU KNOW MAYBE A THE'RE THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES SOMEWOR YOU EXERCISES IN ORDER MAINTAIN HEALTH I'M ANESTHETICSAND A LUNCHEVITY ET CETERA A AND THEY NEVER REALLY FINISH ANY WORK OUT COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED THEIRE SLEEPING OQ THEIR APPETITES OK CAN WE ASSUME THAT THEY ARE RECOVERING WELL AM OR MAY BE THERE NOT CREATING ENOUGH OF A ADAPTATION RESPONSE THAT THERE'S NO PROGRESSIVE OVER REACHING AND SO THERE'S REALLY KNOW STIMULUS FOR RECOVERY WHAT I'M SING HERE IS ON THE THE FACE OF IT I THINK IS OBVIOUS RIGHT IF YOU DON'T TRAIN HARD THERE'S NOTHING TO RECOVER FROM WHAT A'M REALLY SAYING IS IS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ITSELF SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TRAIN IN OTHER WORDS CAN WE GET BETTER AT RECOVERING AND THE A ANALOGY HERE WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE FOCUS IN ORDER TO A PERFORM WORK OF ANY KIND BUT CERTAINLY MENTAL WORK AND PHYSICAL WORTH WE NEED BE ABLE TO FOCUS THE ABILITY OF FOCUS IS THE REFLECTION OF A BUNCH OF NURL CIRCUITS AND CHEMICALS AND HARMONES ET CETERA BUT WE KNOW ROUGHLY WHAT THOSE ARE AND WE KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE POOR AT FOCUSING FOR EVERY SMALL BIT OF TIME THAT YOU CAN FOCUS A LITTLE BIT LONGER EVEN ITS A MATTER OF SECONDS THOSE CIRCUITS THEMSELVES GET BETTER AT FOCUSING AND SO ON IN SO FORTH SO IN OTHER WORDS IS THE RECOVERY SYSTEM HOWEVER BROAD NO TRANSMITT FOREMONES NURL MUSCULAR IMMUN BASE ET CETERA CAN THAT SYSTEM ARE SET OF SYSTEMS BECOME BETTER CAN WE GET BETTER AT RECOVERING ANMEANING CAN I BECOME FASTER AND A A MORE EFFECTIVE AM CAN WE THINK OF THE RECOVERY SYSTEM AS KIND OF A BLADE THAT GET SHARPER BY ENGAGING RECOVERY BECAUSE IF SO THEN THERE'S STRONG REASON FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PUSHING REALLY HARD TO PUSH AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN IS COMFORTABLE FOR THEM EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SYSTEM DOESN'T START A SLIDE BACK REMEMBER PHYSIOLOGY IS LISTENING TO EVERYTHING YOU DO AND IT IS ALWAYS RESPONDING SO THE ANALOGY THAT I WILL MEET YOUR ANOWLOGY WITH THAT I USE HERE'S THE BOWLING ALLY SO YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN BOWLING BEFORE AND YOU'VE USED THE BUMPER LANES RIGHT BUMPERLANES I AVE GONE POWLING BEFORE AND I SPEND TIME IN THE GUTTER AND I'VE SPEND TIME ON N THE PINS I  A SO BEEN A WHILE WE S T HAVE A BOWLINGALLING THE TOWN WHI WENT TO M THIS FUN WES TO SLIDE AROUND ON THEIR SHOES AN LIKE IT ALL THE KIDS WOULD HANG OUT THERE AND I FEEL IT DLAST TILL HAVE BOWLING ALLIES I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF FEELS A HALOMTHING THAT MAY HAVE GONE THE THE WAY OF THE THE MID TWO THOUSANDS I DON'T CARE NO ONE BILLS ANY MORE YOU NOT CAN A RIN MY GOOD ANOL O CE WHAT DUT WHAT MIT INTEND WASN'T TO RUIN YOUR ANALOGY A OGE TS IHUNT BOWLING ALL THE BOWLERS SINGING TO COME AFTER ME WITH WITH A BOWLING BALLS I HERE CA GEN AT LASTED WITH  ALL THE STAFTS IN ELEVATIONS A DONER O SO IF WHAT ONE WERE TO GO BOWLING AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THEIR BAWL ON THE GUTER YOU COULD PUT THESE LITTLE BUMPERS IN THOSE LANS AND THESE LITTLE FOLM PADS THAT GO ON THE GUTTER THAT IF YOUR BOWL IS GOING TOWARDS THE GUTTR HITS THOSE AND BAUNCES OFF AND GOES BACK IN THE LANE RIGHT O CAE SO IN N THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION AN THIS IS ACTUALLY TRUE OF A LOT OF THE WAY PEOPLE APPROACH THER FITNESS AND HEALTH PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED OFTEN TIMES WITH OPTIMIZING MEANING I WANT TO MAKE SURE I DON'T GO IN THE GUTTER I DON'T WANT TO HIT THE WALLS SO THEREFORE I'MIN A TRY TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY IN WHICH I THROW THE BALL SO ON TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M THROWING IT DOWN THE SCENT OF THE LANE MORE OFTEN AND I WANT TO GET MY DIS MY STANTIDEVIATION TIGHTER AN TIGHTER SO THAT I DON'T GET ANYWHERE CLOSE TO HITTING THE WALL HOWEVER WHUT THEY'RE NOT REALIZING IS IF YOU DO THAT THE BODY WILL START SHRINKING THE SIZE OF THE LANE CAUSE WHAT A BASCU SAYS IS H WE HAVEN'T HAW TA BALL TOUCH US IN YEARS WE DON'T NEED TO BE THIS WIDE LET'S GET SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SMALLER SO IT'S NOT TH YOU ACTUALLY ARE HAVING A REDUCED ABILITY TO RECOVER BUT YOU START BECOMING INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE TO THAT SO YOU'RE TWO STRATEGIES FOR N HANCE YOUNG RECOVERY ARE TO PRACTICSE GETTING CLOSER OF THROWING THAT BALL DOWN THE MIDDLE LANE OR TO WIDEN TO WIDEN THE ALLEY  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO AND YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD DO THAT AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO PRECISE WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE YOU'RE ABILITY TO HANDLE SO MANY THINGS IS WHIDEN SO IF YOU'RE OFF NOW BY FOUR OR FIVE INCHES TO THE RIGHT NO PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU'VE JUST TRIPLED THE SIZE OF YOUR ALLEY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO SO PAYING ATTENTION TO TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE IS GETTING BETTER AT ACCURACY MAYBE STAYING REALLY TIGHT WITH YOUR PROGRESSIONS IM USING NUTRICIAN AND SLEE TO OPTIMZE YOUR RECOVERY AND PUSH YOURE RASILIANS IS WHAT WE CALL THIS IN FACT THERE'S ACTUALY A BIOLOGICAL WY TO MEASURE RASILIENS WE WE DO THAT IN ALL OF OUR FOLKS AM THIS IS SCIENTIFIC VALUATITS OF AND IT IS MAKE IT UP YOU CAN ACTILN MEASURE RECILLIENCS ON THERE'S MORE AND MORE COMING OUT ON THIS BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT TERMIN SO HOW WELL CAN YOU HANDLE AND BANG THINGS OFF THIS VESTEL SO WHEN YOU SEE A REDUCTION IN SAY TEN PER CENT OF YOUR ACH AR BE TODAY FOR YOU THAT MAKE MAKE YOU FEEL TERRIBLE FOR ME I MIGHT NOT FEEL ANYTHING BECAUSE I'M WELL ADAPTED TO LARGE FLUCTUATIONS AND THEREFORE I'M MOCCAT THE LESS UNLESS YOU DO THAT THE MORE AND MORE RESPONSIVE YOU WILL BE TO THOSE SLIGHT DEVIATIONS SO THAT IS EXACTLY THE TARGETN THAT'S KINDLE WHAT I LUDE TO WHEN I SAY YOU GOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WE OPTIMIZING FOR WE OPTIMIZING FOR MAKING SURE I DON'T FEEL ANY DIFFERENT TO DAY OR WE OPTIMIZE AND MAKE SURE WHEN I DO FEEL DIFFERENT I STILL AM ABLE TO PERFORM I SO THIS IS WHY YOU WANT TO DO THINGS LIKE MAYBE YOU SOME CAFEN TODAY AND FEEL GREAT BUT IF I HAVE TO USE IT EVERY DAY ALL I'M DOING IS SHRINKING MY SENSITIVITY THERE SO NOW IF I HAVE TO GO A DAY WITHOUT IT I CAN'T TRAIN IT ALL RIGHT CAFINE IS THE EASY EXAMPBLE COUS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HOLDS SMORK BUT THIS IS REALLY TRUE OF EVERYTHING ELSE SO YET YOU NEED TO PRACTICE THIS AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO GIVE YOURSELF MORE STR S TO CONTINUE TO BRING IN THE STRESS FROM NEUTRITION FROM TRAINING FROM BREATH WORK M YOU MENTION EARLIER ABOUT FOCUS THE EXACT SAME THING WRIGHT IS NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING BETTER RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT TRAINING A SYSTEM AND YOU CAN CLEARLY TRAIN THAT RIGHT MWE WILL OFTEN SAY BREATH WORK IS A PRACTICE THAT'S EXACTLY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT SO YOU'RE PRACTISING GETTING BETTER AT THESE THINGS O'RE PRACTISING RETURNING YOUR FOCUS YOU'RE PRACTISING RECOVERING AND QUITE LITRALLY PHYSIOLOGICALLY YOU CAN UPREGULATE WE THEY WERE TALKING ENSIMES WIT THEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REGULATORS THESE WILL BE UPREGULATED SO THE THE NIME NEXT TIME THAT THAT INSULT COMES IN IT'S NOT AS BECAUS SIAS DAMAGING SO YET ABSOLUTLY YOU CAN AND YOU SHOULD STRIKE FOR THAT THROUGHOUT ALL THE EPISODES WHERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EXERCISE THAT THE CORE OF THAT IS THI WORD ADAPTATIONS AND I LOVE THAT YOU MENTION THAT BREATH WORK CAN ALSO CREATE ADAPTATIONS THE WAY I'M VISUALIZING ALL OF THIS NOW IS THAT RESISTANCE TRAINING WITH WAITS MACHINE'S BODIWY OTHERWISE CARDY OF ASCULAR TRAINING RUNNING JOGGING SPRINTING JUMPING AND SO ON THERMAL TRAINING EXPOSURE TO HEAT EXPOSURE TO COLD IN A DEDICATED WAY AND DELIBERATE RESPIRATION ACA BREATHING OR BREATH WORK AS A PRACTICE ALL OF THOSE CAN BE VIEWED AS WAYS TO TRIGGER ADAPTATIONS AND IN THE CONTECTS OF RECOVERY THE SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS YOU'RE TRYING TO ENGAGE ARE OPPOSITE DISTRESS IN FACT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PERHAPS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE MAYBE DELIBERTE HEAT EXPOSURE CAUSE IF THE SAWNUS REALLY HOT YOU CAN GET THE DINORPHAN RELEASE WHICH IS KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE BUT STILL IN BOTH THOSE CASES THE REBOUND FROM THAT IN OTHERS WHEN YOU GET OUT YOU SHOWER GO TO BED THE NEXT MORNING YOU DO AVE THIS KIND OF BLISST OUT FEELING WE KNOW WHY THAT IS THAT IS THE REBOUND TO THAT UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION SO IT SEEMS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER NOT YOU'RE RE USING RESISTANCE YOU'RE EEN CARNIGASCULAR TRAINING USING THERMOLE APPROACH IS ERE YOU'RE USING RESPIRATION BASED RAPPROACHES ALL OF THESE ARE REALLY WAYS OF BOTH TRIGGERING ADAPTATIONS AND IF APPLIED PROPERLY TO ACTUALLY HELP YOU RECOVER FROM THE STRESS AND CREATE THE THE LITERAL RESULT THAT YOU'R THAY YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS BUT I THINK FOR MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF THIS SET OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING OF THE SERIES THESE EPISODES SUALLY THE FIRST TIME THA AVE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT EXERCISE IN THESE WAYS IN ANY EVENT IT'S JUST A REFLECTION BUT IT'S ONE THAT AT LEAST FOR ME UM IT'S TREMENDOUSLY USEFUL BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF A ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC TO IT AH WHICH AT LEAST APPEALS TO TO MY BRAIN BECAUSE THE MORE THE THINGS HAVE A LOGIC THE MORE FOR ME THAT THEY BECOME SIMPLIFIED IN THE MORE THAT THE VAST ARRAY OF TOOLS A BECOMES A BECOMES VISIBLE TO ME AS YOU SAID EARLIER WHAT IS IT LET ME MA SHRIKE AT THIS RITE IT'S A CONCEPTS ARE FEW METHODS ARE MANY PRETTICLOS O  HOW WOULD YOU APUT BEHIND TIS HOW YOU STATE IT METHODS ARE MANY CONSEPS OR FEW A GO EITHER THE DIRECTIONALITY PROBABLY IT DOESN'T NO LET'S KEEP IT RIGHT THE THE METHODS ARE MANY A CONCEPTS ARE FEW AM A GALPAN'S LAW I INSIDE YU'RE NOT LOW TO NAME THINGS AFTER YOURSELF AM BUT YOU CAN IM A THINK AFTER OTHER PEOPLE SO I IT'S A GALPAN'S LAW BECAUSE I'M DEAFLY THE ONE WHO CREATED THAT IDEA A ABSOLUTELY THAT WAS EXTREME AND TREMENDOUS SARCASM TO SOWERE ALTR I REGARDLESS  HERE WE GO GA GALPANS LAW THE I GO ONE THING THAT'S IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW IS WE'VE THROWN OUT A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR FOLKS AND MAYBE WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY TO SIMPLIFY A LITTLE BIT SO WHAT I CAN KIND OF WALK YOU THROUGH IS HOW WE MEASURE RECOVERY IF YOU WILL AND HOW OFTEN AND SOME TOOLS AND WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND PEOPLE DO IS NOT USE EVERYTHING I SAID YOU WANT A PICK ONE OR TWO THINGS PR CATEGORY THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT ARE AT YOUR COST  BETTER AT YOUR AVAILABILITY THAT OR INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT RELEVANT TO YOU AND DO THAT THE REASON I KIND OFWONTE TO COVER A A LARGE NUMBER OF THINGS WAS TO GIVE AFOLKS OPTIONS BUT AGAIN I WANT EMPHASIZE THE POINT IS TO NOT MEASURE ALL OF THEM IN FACT YOU DON'T NEED TO WE A I'VE RAN THIS BEFORE WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHIYS WEAR WE'VE TAKEN BLOOD YOU'REN EVERY SINGLE DAY WE'VE DONE PERFORMANCE MEASURES A VERTICAL JUMPS ON A FORCE PLATE HOLD ONT TO THINGS EVERY DAY FOR YEARS ON END AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THERE IS TREMENDOUS FOR DONTANCY IN PHYSIOLOGY RIGHT EVERYTHING AS EVERYTHING SO YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THEM AND DON'T FEEL LIKE YOUR MISSING OUT IF YOU AREN'T DOING THEM ONE OR TWO METRICS IS PROBABLY FIND I GENERALLY RECOMMEND ONE SUBJECTIVE MEASURE THIS COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS WHAT'S YOUR MOOD HOW D YOU FEEL TO DAY GREAT AND ONE OBJECTIVE MEASURE ACH ARVE A RESTING HEART RAY ANYTHING OUCS RIGHT SO IF YOU EVEN LITERALLY JUST DID THAT YOUD PROBABLY HAVE PRETTY GOOD INSIGHT AS TO WHAT YOU DONG SO MAYBE IN FACT ON ALLL LEGA MORE DETAIL HERE MAYBE GIVE YOU COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THINGS TO MEASURE EVERY DAY SOME THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD MEASURE MAYBE A QORTERLY MONTHLY AND THEN MAYBE EVEN IN SOME MI ANNUALLY AND THEN YOU CAN MAYBE JUST PICK A COUPLE FOR MESES CATEGORIES AND HAVE YOURSELF A PRETTY GOOD MONITERING SYSTEM AFOR WHAT TO DO AND A'LL INCLUDE SOME THAT AR A LITTLE B A TECNOLOGY BASEIN AN OTHERS THAT ARE TOTALLY COSTRYANE REQUIRE NOTHING OK CATE START OFF I WOULD RECOMMEND TAKING SOMETHING LIKE AH ARE V EVERY DAY OR OR MOST DAYS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DEVICE LIKE THAT YOU COULD ALSO USE HONESTY A THE SEAL TO TOLERANCE TUST AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT A NUMBER OF TIMES AND WE PROBY UP PONY RESEURCES GIL FIND THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANYTHING AT TYPICALLY TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE OR SO AND YOU CAN DO THAT UNDER THE SAME SU IRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ACH AVEY IN OTHER WORDS DO AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY HAVE THE SAME SCENTETIZATIONS OF AND THAT IS ACTUALLY BEEN IN OUR COACHING EXPERIENCE A WHILE ADMITTEDLY THERE IS NO APPUR OFVEWED RESEARCH ON THIS YET JUST IN OUR EXPERIENCE IS TENDS TO TRACT EXTREMELY CLOSELY WITH A H ARV AND OTHER METRICS OF RECOVERY IN FACT WE ACTUALLY DID DO A AA PILOT TRIAL IN MY LAB AND IT TA ATTRACT DECENTLY WELL WITH BOTH STATE AND TRADE ANXIETY SO A IT'S A NICE METRIC ANOT PERFECT BUT U YOU COULD TAKE THAT SO IF YOU WANTED YOU CULD DO BOTH ABUT AGAIN REMEMBER YOU'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE SYSTEM EXTRESS AND SO YOU'RE REALLY JUST SHOWING YOU'R MEASURING ONE THING TO WAYS SO YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE THEM BOTH I WILL DO BOTH BECAUSE I CONSUPERINTETED IN SMALL DIFFERENCES BUT GLOBABLY THEY'RE GOING TO TELL YOU BASELY THE SAME THING SO THOSE OR TWO THINGS WILL BE USE AGAIN BASELY DAILY  YOU'RE OUT OR OR CLOSE TO IT IF YOU WANTO GO PASS OUT A LITTLE BID AYOU CAN LOOK AT YU CAN USE AN ACTUAL A A A PRETTY OLD A COMMONLY USED SURVEY CALLED A DALDA D A L D A I FORGET THE EXACT ACCRNYM BUT IT IS A FAIRLY LENGTHY QUESTION AIR AND IT ACCOUNTS FOR THINGS LIKE HOWY FIELD TO DAY HOW TO YOU SLEE AA STRESSERS GOING ON IR LIFE HOW YOU BEEN EATING AND ITS TIS IS LIKE FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE LENGTHY SURVE A THAT CAME OUT I MEAN JEESEIS PROBABLY BEEN ROUND FOR THIRTY YEARS OR SOMETHING ISIS IT'S NOTHING NEW AND BEEN USED EXSTENSIVELY A I YOU WOULD NOT WANTO DO THAT EVERY DAY IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE SOME SUBJECT TOV MEASURES EVERY DAY WE TYPICALLY STICK WITH LIKE IAVE SAID MOOD A MOTIVATION SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU YOU COULD PERFORM THIS ALL DETEST TO SOMETHING MORE LIKE MONTHLY OR AT THE END OF EACH TRAINING PHASE IN EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND PROBABLY WORTH LOOKING AT IT'S NOT IN I TELL YOU IF YOU'EIN A BAD SPOT TO DAY OR TO MORROW BUT YOU WOULD PICK THAT UP WITH THE ATER OF YEAR SUIT TOTOTENISUS IT WOULD THOUGH TELL YOU INFORMATION ESPECIALLYIF YOUAR WORKING WITH ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL ABOUT MAJOUR LIFE CHANGES AND IF ANYTHING IT JUST FACILITATES THAT CONVERSATION I I NOTICED YOU REPORTED ACTS HAPPENING ALET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THATAN CAN I HELP CETERA SO ANOTHER COT US SNIKY HELPFUL ONE IS IS  SIMPLY BODY I LIKE I'VE SAID A NONFUNCTIONAL OVER REACHING AND OVERTRAINING ARE ASSOCIATE WITH THE NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE ENERGY AAPPETITE SUPPRESSION CHANGES IN AN AND BODY WAIGHT OR BODY COMPOSITION SO YOU CAN MEASURE THAT A MONTHLY OR EVEN REALLY QUARTERLY A DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF ATHLETOR INDIVIDUAL YOUR WORKING ATTER IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SPECIALL YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO LOSE WAITER IF YOU'R RYING TO BE AT MAITENANCE N TH GISEMEN IDES AS WELL SO MOVING PASS THAT NOW ACTUALLY WERE GING TO MOVE INTO THE REALM OF THINGS THAT WE CALL HIDDEN STRESSERS SO AS WIT THOSE ARE ALL VISIBLE STRESSORS I'M SO HIDNSTRESSERS THE MOST COMMON ONES WEE SORT TO MENTIOND A ANDI WOULD PROBABLY DO THIS AYOU WELL YOU NO HAVE TO THESE ONES THROUGH SEROM SO THIS IS BLOOD WORK CORT IS ALL LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT A INTESTOSTRONE AN THE O THEN OF COURSE TEST SOSERAN OCORS A RATIO HEN THE OTHER ONES I MENTIONED I YOU CAN DO THOSE QUARTERLY IT'S NOT BAD THERE ARE SOME BLOOD MARKERS THAT THERE'S REALY NO SENSE TO DO THEM THAT SOON AND THERE'RE OTHER MARKERS AND MEING IN OUR SYSTEM AR INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTNG PRETTY SENSE OF BLOOD WORK SALIVA WORK YEARN AND AN STOOL AND THES SO THE'S PLENTY OF THOSE THINK YOU JUST DO NOT NEED TO MEASURE NOEVERY TEN WEEKS OR SO IIN THIS CASE YOU COURSE ALL AS YOU KNOW SORT OF CHANGES RAPIDLY  TESTOSTRONE CAN CHANGE PRETTY QUICKLY IBUT IF YOURE REALLY TRYING TO NOTICE A LARGE TRAND MO CERTAINLY IT CARTERLY OR SO IS ISNAT APPROPRIATE TIME FOR HIM DOING EVERY FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS PROBABLY UN NECESSARY SOU CAN SAE YOURSELF SOE MONEY AND DO THAT IMOTHER SUF YOU CAN LOOK AT ACTUALLY MORE LIKE SEM I ANNUALLY IN AM PLASAMA LIKE GLUDOMIN AND GLUTMING TO GLUTIMATE RATIO AND A IT CAN MAY BE SAVE THAT WHY YOU WANT T OK AT THOSE FOR NOTHER CONVERSATION BUT THOSE ARE IMPORTANT  WE ALWAYS LOOK AT SOMETHING FROM THE OXIDA DISTRESS THANGS SO THIS COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE T ENAGH ALFAR IN A LUKAN SIX SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAN WERE LOKIN AT THAT IN SEERAM NDWE LOOK AT THAT N LIKE SEM MI ANNUALLY AND THEN ANOTHER SNEAKY ACTUALY ONE AM THAT I LOVE TO LOOK AT IS A THE NEUTRA FILLD THE LYMPHASITE RATIO WHICH YOU GIVE U SOME PRETTY GOD INSIDE ND CAN OU COAN LOOK AT THAT LIKE FAIRLY CARTERLY IF A THAT NUMBER STARS TO GET REALLY HIGH CERTAINLY LIKE MORE THAN NINE TO ONE YOU GOT A PRETTY COULD INSIDE THAT SOMETHING NORLAS GOING ON AT YOUR MAN SYSTEM SO I WE WILL ACTUALY TAKE ACTION MUCH LOWER THAN THAT NUMBER BUT THAT'S LIKE A NICE CUT OFF YOU'LL SEE IS LIKE THAT'S VERY VERY HIGH NUMBER SO I THOSE AR SOME THINGS YOU CAN USE A MOST FOLKS HAVE THE ABILITY HOPEFULLY TO GET SOME BASIC BLOOD WORK DONE GET A BASIC WHAT'SCALL A C B C AND C M P IM IF YOU HAVE A GREAT PHYSICIAN AND YOUAN GET INSURANCE TO COVER THAT AND YOU JUST GOING AND ASK FOR A C B C AND C M P THEY'LLKNOW WHAT THAT MEANS YO GO GLAD AND THEY' ORDER IT YOU'LL GET ALL THE INFORMATION TYPICALLY THAT I JIS DESCRIBED OR CLOSE ENOUGH AND YOU'LL GET SOME INSIGHTS ANDTHEN YOU GAIN YOU CAN TO CUSE THAT FREE SERVICE I MENTION EARLIER TO CHECK TO SEE WHAT ARE NOT THE CHANGES ARE IM JUST A MATTER OF TESTING QUALITY OR ACTUALLY PHYSIOLOGICAL  RELEVANT WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS AN AMAZINGLY POWERFUL ARRAY OF TOOLS I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN ALSO MENTION A FEU TOOLS THAT ARE EITHER LOWER COST TRULY LOW COST OR IS ZERO COST THAT WHILE THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE ACCURACY OR IM GIVE THE COMPLETE PICTURE THAT SOME OF THE BILE MARKERS AND OTHER TOOLS THAT YOU MENTIONED DO THAT THEY CAN STILL PROVIDE REASONABLY RELIABLE METRICS THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IN ORDER TO ASSESS THEIR LEVEL OF RECOVERY ABSOLUTELY THE SEEL TO TOLON US EST WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE IM AND YOU CAN JUST TAKE THAT METRIC  TIME YOU LIKE THE OTHER ONES WE TALKD ABOUT SO FAR OR THINGS LIKE YOUR MOOD  WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED LIBITO BUT THAT'S ANOTHER A SESTAMENT THAT PEOPLE ALSO TEND TO HAVE A PRETTY GOOD GRIP ON AND THEY KNOW WHAT FEELS NORMAL SO WHEN THINGS GO OUT A WACK IT TENDS TO BE A PRETTY GOOD SIGNAL THAT PEOPLE WIRL RECOGNIZE YEND ONE NOTE ABOUT THAT A SOMETHING IT CAME UP IN AN EPISODE ON A ON HORMONS BOT FOR MALE AND FEMALE HEALTH A THAT AT SOME POINT IT WILL EIR AM WHICH IS THAT KNOW THERE'S NO OBJECTIVE MEASURE FOR PEOPLE IN TERMS OF LIBIDO ACROSS THE BOARD MEANING PEOPLE VERY TREMENDOUSLY AM AGE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCE IS AM AND ON AND ON AND SO A THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SUBJECTIVE MEASURES THAT I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO A HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHAT THEIR QUITIGA BASE LINE REALLY IS AND I'M GUESSING THAT THE TIME TO ASSESS THAT MIGHT BEST BE A WHEN INITIATING OR MIDWAY THROUGH A RELATIVELY LOW INTENSITY TRAINING FACE AM MAYBE DURING THE TIME OF YEAR IN WHICH ALL THE OTHER FACTORS AM THAT CAN INFLUENCE LIBIDO ARE NOT A AT THEIR MAXIMUM SO IF YOU THING ABOUT YON LIGHT AND DOPAMEIN IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE AND THE TESTOSTRON ESTROGEN SYSTEMS WE KNOW THAT LIBIDO A TESTOSTRO AN ESTROGEN MEN AND WOMEN A TENDS TO PIK IN THE SUMMER MONTHS SO IF THAT'S YOUR BASE LINE THAT YOU'R COMPARING TO I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S AS RELIABLE AS A PEING SOMETHING LIKE THE THE FALL OR THE SPRING A AND SO ANYWAY THIS AGAIN IS VERY SUBJECTIVE BUT WHE DISENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO A RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S NO STANDARD NUMBERS FOR THIS NO LOOK UP TABLE D THERE'S NO EQUIVLENT OF THE LIBIDOBIAMI THE ELEMI A NO DICE RESPECTIVE THAT THE ACARNEM THAT PROBABLY IS ELEMIN A SO I THINK THAT IS THERE SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MINE AS PEOPLE A THE DO COMPARISONS WERE SUBJECTIVE COMPARISONS IS DON'T PICK A COMPARISON TO AN EXTREME TRYIND PICK A COMPARISON TO AT AVERAGE AS YOU KNOW IT TO BE THAT ACTUALLY SORT OF REMINDID ME ONE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE SEEN A LOT LATELY IS PEOPLE IF THEIR HAVING LIBITO ISSUES OR JUST EVEN SLIGHTLY NOTICING A DROP THEY JUST ASSUME THAT THEN THEIR FOR MEANS OR TESTOSTRON HIS CRAFTHING AND THOSE THINGS ARE CERTAINLY ONNECTED BUT THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE AND WHERE THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM IS AN PEOPLE THEN GO A ON THINGS LIKE TIART ET CETERA WITH NO TRUE O FOR SIGHT AND THEN ALL KINDS OFTHER PROBLEM SO  MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU GON TO TAKE THAT STEP THAT YOU ACTUALLY GET THE STOPS RON MEASURE IT IN YOUR WORKING WITH A QUALIFIED PERSON TO GUIDE YOU THOUGH THAT PROCESS DON'T JUST ASSUME BECAUSE YOURE HAVING O ENERGY OR YOUR LIBIDO IS LITT UP IT DOWN IT COULD BE SIMPLY TRAINING WITH IT IT COULD BESLYP PRELHATED COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF THINGS A SO THATS THIKE A LITTLE BIT OF ORD A CAUTION THER TOO QUICK POINTS ALONG THE LINES WHAT YOU JUST SAID ONE INTERESTING THING THAT I LEARN WHEN RESEARCHING OUR EPISODE ON TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN OPTIMIZATION THIS WAS AN EPISODE THAT WE DONE SOME TIME AGO BUT IS STILL AVAILABLE IN ER KUBRAN LAUGHD OT CO WALL FORM ATS ET CETERA IS THAT MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY INCREASE THEIR LIBIDO AND EVEN THEIR LEVELS OF TESTOSTRON AT ESTROGEN AS THEY PROGRESS FROM THEIR TWENTIES INTO THEIR FORTIES IF THEY TAKE EXCELLENT CARE ORF THEMSELVES NCLUDING THE CRRACT EXERCISE ADAPTATIONS CORRECT BODY FAT TO LEAN A LEMUSCLE A RATIOS BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN GO THE OTHER WAY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN BE TRAINING TO ACHIEVE SUCH LOW BODY FAT STORES THAT LEBIDO CAN SOPER SO IT NO THE AGE DEPEND A AGE RELATED DECLINES IN LEBIDO A ARE NOT NECESSARILY AM WRITTEN INTO THE SCRIPTIVE LIFE IN FACT THERE ARE SOME DATO POINTS FROM REALLY INTERESTING PAPER A TALK ABOUT IN THAT  EPISODE OF A INDIVIDUALS THIS WAS O STUDY FOCUSTON MAILS IN THEIR EIDIES AND NINETIES WHO MAINTAINED TOTAL IN FREE TESTOSTRON AS HIG AS A INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR TWENTIES BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LIFESTYLE FACTORS OF THOSE PEOPLE THEIR ETIES AND NINETIES THEY WERE DOING A LOT TO CREATE THAT THAT SENARIO THE SECOND POINT IS ONE RELATE TO WHA YOU JUST SAID A WHICH IS VERY TRUE WHICH IS PEOPLE GENERALLY TEND TO ASSUME THAT A DROP IN LEBIDO IS RELATED TO A DROP IN TESTOSTRONE AM AND THEN ASSUME THAT THEY NEED TO INCREASE THEIR TESTOSTRO AND IN SOME CASES THAT IS TRUE ABSOBUT IT'S ALSO OFTEN THE CASE THAT PEOPLE WHO TAKE ESTROGEN OR A ROMATASTE BLOCKERS THATIS ANDS I'M A INHIBITERS THAT PREVENT THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTRON TO ASTROGEN EXPERIENCE SEVERE DEPHESISTS IN LEBIDO BECAUSE OF ESTROGEN BPOLLYLO OLDO ESTROGEN BLOCKERS ARE AS MUCH IN ISSUE HERE AS AM LOW TESTOSTRON THAN THE FINAL POINT IS ALSO ONE THAT A MANY PEOPLE NOW MEN AND WOMEN ARE A A N I THINK NEED TO BE AWARE OF WHICH IS THAT DI HYDROTESTOSTRON DH T IS AMONG THE MORE POWERFUL ANDROGENS FOR A POWER OUTPUT PHYSICAL POWER OUTBUT BUT ALSO FOR LEBIDO AND DHK IS STRONGLY INHIBITED BY CERTAIN THINGS LIKE TUMERIC SOME LOT OF PEOPLE  TAKING A HYDOSES OF TUMERIC A CAN EXPERIENCE DROPS IN LEBIDO SO T THERE AND A WHORE TAKING A A VARIOUS COMPOUNDS TO PREVENT HAIRLOSS YET THINGS LIKE FINASTRI O SO THERE'S A WHOLE CATALOGUE OF THINGS THAT CAN REDUCE LEBIDO THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY IN THE TESTOSTRON PATHWAY THAT CAN BE DC RELATER ESTROGEM LATE AND THIS I THINK POINTS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF YES TAKE A SUBJECTIVE MEASURE OF YOUR LEBIDO PAY ATTENTION A SENTALY BE AWARE DON'T YOUNOW DON'T UP SASPABI BUT BE AWARE IN TRYING TO FIGOR OUT WHAT FACTORS AMA ARE INVOLVED FOR YOU BUT DON'T IMMEDIATELY ASSUME THAT IT WHAT'S NEEDED IS MORE TESTOSTRONE AND OFTEN TIMES A THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE YET  YET TRY TO PUT ON A LOT A MASCLE WITH NO ESTRDAN GOOD LUCK WRIGHT IN AND INDEED A LOT OF A ATLETS IN PARTICULAR A YOU KNOW COMPETID BOYBILLERS THAT HAVE THAT YOU KNOW SERAN RAP THIN SKIN IF YOU GET TO KNOW SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE YOU TALK TO THEM THEY THEY CAN A LOOK LIKE THE SORT OF COMIC BOOK ARCHITYPE OF WHAT A SOME ONE MIGHT MIGHT WANT TO BE MIN THAT'S NOT WITH THIS DISCUSSION OR THESE EPISODES HAVE BEEN ABOUT BUT OFTENTIMES THEY CAN HAVE A MSERIOUS LEBIDO ISSUES I MENTION EARLIER AND I WILL EMPHASIZE IT ONCE MORE YOU NEED TO BE VERY CACIOUS WHEN YOU'RE TAKING ANTIOXIDENS ANT FLAMATORIES CORTERSALL PRODUCERS FOR ALL THOSE REASONS OR I DIDN'T REALLY THROR TO GET AN EXAMPLES BUT YOU JUST NAILED ANOTHER FANTASTIC REASON OF IT WE DO NOT GIVE THOSE THINGS PROPHALACTICALLY I A STRONGLY DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM JUST WALKING AROUND TAKING SUPPLEMENTATION OF ANTIOXIDENS I'M SPECIALLY POWERFUL ONES FOR NO REASON IF YOU HAVE DONE SOME TESTING AND YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON TO DO SO A FINE OR IFYER AN A VERY SPECIFIC TAK TRAINING FAYS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT CO BUT IF YOU UST WALKING AROUND DOING THAT YOU ARE OFTEN TIMES NOT ALWAYS BUT YOUARE OFTENTIMES CAUSING PROBLEMS THAT THEN YOU THEN TRY TO SOLVE BY TAKING MORE OF THOSE ANTINFLAMATORIES I FEEL TERRIBLE LO ENERGY LOLBIDO BABABBABLA I'M TOO INFLAMED ET CETERA SO YE ANTIOCCIDENTS IN THE FORM OF FOOD ARE FANTASTIC ALMOST NO ISSUE THERE IS A GOOD EVIDENCE ACTUALLY THERE SO DN'T WORRY ABOUT MEN I SHOULDN'T EAT HIGH ANTI OCCEDENT RICH FOODS YOU'RE GOBY FINE WET WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS FORM OF SUITACLES AN SUPPLEMENTATION WHERE YOU CAN TAKE ORDERS OF MAGNETUDE HIRE DOSAGES VERY QUICKLY HAN YOU COULD IN THE PRESENCE OF FOOD SO THAT IN DISTINCTION IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT I ANTIOCEN RICH FOODS ARE GENERALLY FINE AND THUS CONSUMED IN TOTALLY ABSURD CONCENTRATIONS SUPPLEMENTATIONS POWDERS CREAM STROGS ET CETERAS WHERE YOU CONAT IN TA PROBLEM SO YET YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF DOING THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE A REASON WE DON'T DO THAT UNLESS A WE WE SEE REASON TO DO SO IN SOME ONES MARKERS YET IN ERBLE COMPOUNDS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ERBL CAN BE QUITE POTENT MODULATORS OF OF HORMONES A ASHAGANDA BEING A AN EXAMPLE A TWO ERBLE COMPOUNDS THAT WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT ON OUR PARCASTBEFORE AN AND REPEATEDLY INCLUDING IN THAT A TESASTRON ASTERAN AN OPTIMIZATION A EPISODE A TONGAALI A AN FIDOGIAGGRETUS AM TONGAALIS NOW TAKEN BY A LARGE NUMBER OF MEND AND WOMEN AM TONGAALI AND FIDOGIA TYPICALLY A MEN I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE ANY GOOD STUDIES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF FIDOGIA  IN WOMEN THOSE ARE ERBL COMPOUNDS THAT CAN HAVE POTENT EFFECTS IN INCREASING TESTOSTRONE AND LUTINIZING HORMONE A DO THEY WORK YET THEY WORK TO VARYING DEGREES IN IN MOST EVERYBODY NOT CERTAINLY NOT IN EVERYBODY A BUT THEY DO WORK BUT THEY THEY WORK BECAUSE THERE POTENT THEY HAVE A FACTS SO THE IDEA THAT ERBAL COMPOUNDS ARE NOT POWERFUL AM IS A WRONG AND IT'S IMPORTANT O REMEMBER THAT THAT CAN CUT BOTH WAYS HENCE MIGHT MENTION OF THIS O OBSERVATION RELATE TO TUMERIC WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT SOME PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE TUMERIC AND FEEL PERFECTLY FINE MAINTAIN OR EVEN INCREASED THEIR LIBITO THAT I SURE THAT CAN HAPPENS JUST THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY DEAHEY SENSITIVE THIS TENDS TO BE AN ISSUE SO THE UNFORTUNATELY FOR MANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS REALLY TO TRY THEM OR TO JUST COMPLETELY AVOID THEM IN THISID YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY THEM IS FIND TOO BUT THERE REALLY AREN'T WAYS TO PR RDIC WHO WILL RESPOND WHO WON'T AND WHO WILL BE HYPER RESPONDERS AND UM IN THAT CAS IT'S A BIT OF A IT TILLLL BIT OF WILD WEST I'M ALSO SO O REMEMBERING WHAT THE POINT OF THIS CONVERSATION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND MAY BE A'L UPERTURND BACK TO THAT AT WHICH WEREH SOME COST FRE YOUR LOW COST MATRICS A THAT WAS THE VERY FUNTANGEN BUT NONETHE LESS A ANOTHER COUPLE OF ONES YOU CAN DO ARE A GRIP STRENGTH TESTING SO IF YOU CAN BUY A YOU FAIRLY CHEAP HAND GRIP DYNAMOMEER ON ANY NUMBER OF PLACES HESE AR TYPICALLY ABLE TO BE PURCHASED FOR TWENTY TO FORTY DOLLARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT RAING I'M YOU CAN ACTUALY DIS TUST AT EVERYDAY I'VE DONE THAT AIN A NUMBER OF VATHES FOR A DECENT BY THE TIME IADMITTEDLY I DON'T DO ANY MORE  THAT'S NOT BECAUSE I DISAGREE THAT BUT BECAUSE WE JUST WE'RE GETTING THE INFORMATION ALREADY AND TO ASSIST TO REDONDINT BUT IF THAT'S TE ONLY OPTION IT IS A GREAT ONE TO DO I MENTION ALSO EARLIER HOW I ACTUALLY LIKE SPEED TEST OVER STRENGTH TEST AS AN EARLIER INDICATION OF OVERREACHING AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I LIKE A VERTICAL JUMP TEST IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A FORCE PLATE THAT'S GREAT YOU THEN YOU CAN GET TO A MORE INDEUBT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FORCE PELOCITY CURVE AND EXCELERATION IN THINGS LIKE THAT I'M USE THE LOT IN HIGH PERFORMANCE SITUATIONS IF NOT SIMPLY LOOKING AT YOU KNOW YOUR PERFORMANCE AND SO YOU CAN CANT TO GO BACK TO ONE OF OUR EARLIER EPISODES WHEN I DESCRIBED COLOURING MY FINGER TIPS WITH HIGH LIGHTERS EARLIER OF MY LIFE YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING AND GOT YOUR GARAGE AND EVERY DAY JUMP UP IN TOUCH A THAT MARKER AN SEE WHE YOU'RE AT I'M SO A SYSTEM LIKE THAT COULD BE DONE YOU CN ALSO USE TOOLS LIKE A FORCE TRANSDUCER AND DO A STANDARD MOVEMENT I CAN SAY A VERTICAL JOM OR A HIGH POLL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND MEASURE THE VELOCITY AND JUST COMPARE THAT DAY TO DAY OF A STANDARD LOAD RAND SO YOU DO IT EVERY SINGLE TIME WITH THE SAME LOAD SAME SIMILAR THING CAN BE DONE U LIKE A A MESIBALTHROP I'M SO YOU HAVE THE SAME BALL YOU THROW THE SAME THING AN IN THIS SORTER WE ARE AT TO DAY YOU WANT TO DO A LITTE BIT O WARM UP BUT NOT EXCESSIVE HERE YOU WANT A CON TO GET AN IDEA OF WHERE YOUR BASE LINE IS ANDYOU DO ONT INFLUENCE IT BY THE VERACITY OF THE WARM UP EVERY SINGLE DAKE AS THAT ALONE CAN CHANGE IT SAME THING WIT STRETCHING ACUTE STATIC STRETCHING  DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THIS POWER PRODUCTION SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT THERE AND ONE DAY DO TWENTY MINUTESTRETCHED BEFORE IN THE OTHER DAY YU DN' STRETCH IT ALL THAT ALONE WILL WILL CAUSE A DEVIATIONS IN YOUR PERFORMANCE SO TRY TO KEEP EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF STANDARDIVES AND THAT'L GIVE YOU LITTLE BIT BETTER TATIM REMEMBERING ALL OF THESE VALUES THE BILE MARKERS A PERFORMSE O THEY HAVE NORMAL VARIATIONS YOU JUST WANT A FIGURE OUT FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT THOSE NORMAL VARIATIONS ARE FOR YOU SO YOU HAVE YOUR NORMAL NUMBER YOU HAVE YOUR STANDARD DEVIATION WHEN YOU STRIKE GETTING OUTSIDE O THAT STANDARDEVIATION YOU START PAYING ATTENTION AND SO THAT'S CONELIK WILL WE WE TYPICALLY CALL THAT THE GRAYSOWN AND SO IF IT ISNIN THEGRAY'S OWN WRE FINE ER NOT JUSTING WIT IF ITS OUTSIDE OF THAT WHATEVER THAT IS FOR YOU RECOGNIZING THAT THE GRAZON IS SMALLER FOR SOME FOLKS AND LARGER FOR OTHERS BUT WHAT IS NORMAL FOR YOU AND YOUR SITUATION AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE YOUR DECISIONS OUTSIDE OF THAT WHEN YOU SEE NUMBERS THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY OR MORE THAN THREE TO FIVE DAYS IN AROW OR CLOSE FOR THE LAST FIVE DAYS FOR THE LAST SIX SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEN YOU MAY HAVE SOME CAUSE FOR ACTION WILL THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS TOOLS AND MODES FOR RECOVERY AND I REALIZE I JUMPE THE GUN A BIT DURING OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT FOOD AND SUPPLEMENTS BUT I LIKE TO THINK THA SERVES AS A NICE A PRECURSOR TO THE NEXT EPISODE WHICH IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION IF YOU'RE LEARNING FROM

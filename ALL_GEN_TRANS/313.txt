FROM W  S CHICAGO IT'S E SPECIAL CHRISTMAS EDITION OF THIS AMERICAN LIFE WE HAVE A BUNCH OF THINGS FOR YOU TO DAY INCLUDING LATER IN THE PROGRAM CHRISTMAS ON FIRE BUT LET JUST GET THINGS OFF RIGHT NOW WITH A SONG RECORDED AN EVENT WE DID ON STAGE A LITTLE WHILE BACK ON THE TWELVE DAY OF CHRISTMASMATULOA TO ME TTOTTINTIN ININI  ANTATO TERTL DOES T I HAVE ALWAYS HATED THAT SONG I HAVE ALWAYS SHAD OF THAT SONG I THOUGHT I THAT SONG IS SYMBOG OF EVERYTHING THAT IS BAD ABOUT CHRISTMAS I SUST SAY I HAVE NO BAD FEELINGS ABOUT CHRISTMAS I AM A NON COMBATANT WHEN IT COMES TO CHRISTMAS AS ON STAGE TALKING BOUT THE SONG CAUSE WE HAD THIS IDEA THAT WE THOUGHT MIGHT MAKE A REALLY FUN THING TO TRY FOR CHRISTMAS AND THAT IS WE ORGANIZED A NIGHT OF IMPROPH COMEDY AND I KNOW OU SAING OR GE HOW AS HI GO TOGETHER WHY IMPROPH COMEDY IN CHRISTMAS OKE WELL THIS CON TICLOD SWANNING STAY WITH ME THIS BRITISH WRITER AND PERFORMER NAME DANIEL KITSEN I SAW HIM SAY THIS THING ABOUT CHRISTMAS THAT SEEMS SO TRUE HE SAYS THAT WHEN YOUARE KID AND YOU WAKE UP CHRISTMAS MORNING WHAT MAKES CHRISTMAS FEEL SO MAGICAL IS THIS FLING OF LIKE OLL MY GOT IS CAN BE AMAZING THE WORLD IS SO FULL OF POSSIBILITY ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN THE FACT THAT SENTICLES EVEN EXIST THIS LITERALLY MAGICAL BEING WHO KEN TO YOUR HOME AND KITSON SAYS THIS THRILLED FEELING THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN THAT IS THE THING THAT IS SO HARD TO HOLD ON TO ONCE WIV BECOME ADULTS AND IF FACT HE SAYS THAT SO MANY ADULTS AT CHRISTMAS THEY TRID TO WE CREATE THE SAME CHRISTMAS YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH THE SAME EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AND OVER IT'S LIKE THEY LOCK IN CHRISTMAS BECOMES THE OPPOSITE OF ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN THAT IS WHY IT NEVER FEELS THIS MAGICAL TO ADULTS BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET BACK TO THAT FEELING AND A CANBACK TO THE PLAN FOR TO DAY SHOW ONE PLACE THAT ADULTS EMBRACE THAT FEELING THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AND IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HN THAN THEY MAKE IT HAPPEN IS IMPROPH COMEDY WERE YOU KNOW THEY WALK ON STAGE WITH NO IDEA WHAT ANYBODY'S GOING TO SAY AND THEN ONE PERSON TRIES SOMETHING THEY SAY SOMETHING AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE PHITCHES IN WITH THE LINE OF THEIR OWN AND THAT SOMEBODY ELSE PITCTURES IN BEFORE YOU KNOWHAT THEY'VE MADE LIKE A WHOLE SEEN A WHOLE WORLD REALLY AND SO WITH THAN IN MIND WE GOT THESE INCREDIBLE IMPROP COMMEDIANS AND WE GOT A CLUB TO PERFORM IN AND WE DID A SHOW AND WE DID THE SHOW IN THIS PARTICULAR STYLE OF IMPROV WERE THE PEOPLE ON STAGE THEY TELL TRUE STORIES ABOUT THEIR LIVES AND THEN THOSE STORIES OF TRUE STRIES BECOME THE BASIS OF THE IMPROPHESCENES THAT THEY THEN INVENT AND THOSE SEENES LEAD THEM TO OTHER TRUE STORIES THAT THEN WE THEEM INTO OTHER IMPROPHSCENES AND SO ON AND SON AND SO ON AND I WAS THERE I CCTHINGS OFF WITH THA STORY ABOUT THAT SONG ABOUT THE SONG TO TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS WHWHICH IS THE SONG THAT I NOTICED EVEN THOUGH JUST TO SAY IT AGAIN CHRISTMAS IS NOT MY DAY I AM NOT SOMEBODY WHO CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS AT ALL O'M A JEW AND I'M NOT THAT KIND OF JEW WHOSE PARENTS CELEBRATED CHRISTMAS ANHONICA WE WERE PURER CONIC OF PEOPLE AND WE LOOK DOWN ON THE CHRISTMAS HONICA JEWS AND IF ACT I GROW UP IN A SUBURB OF BALTIMORE THAT WAS SO JEWISH I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE IN THE MINORIDY AND SO CHRISTMAS I DO NOTHING IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME THE DAY MEANS NOTHING AND MOST YEARS I GO TO VAGUS ON CHRISTMAS BUT I DO REALLY LOVE CHRISTMAS MUSIC IAVE ALWAYS LOVED CHRISTMASMUSIC AN ND AND AT SOME POINT IN MY TWENTIES AS TAE TO MAKE A COLLECTION OF CHRISTMAS SEDIS AND RECORDS AND THE WORST SONG OF ALL IS THE SONG THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMES AND WHENEVER IT COMES ON I JUST THINK LIKE WY IS THIS STILL IN CIRCULATION FIRST OF ALL THE WORDS REFER TO A WIFE AND A WORLD THAT NONE OF US CAN RELATE TO OR CAREABA TWOLVED WORDS A WEEPING WE WHAT IS WHAT EXPERIENCE IS THAT EVEN REFERRING TOAND THEN SWANS ARE SWIMMING GEESE ARE LAYING SO SO ARE WE IN A WORM CIMATE OF COLD CIM IT JUST RAISES SO MANY QUESTIONS BUT ALSO THE FORM OF THE SONG IS SO INTENSELY BORING AND YOU GI SO O TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU DO THE FIRST ONE AND THEN YOU GO BACK AND YU DO ALL THE ONES BEFORE WHICH YOU ALREADY DID YOU NOWANY MEANS TO YOU DO TWO TURTLE DOVES AN A PARTES NA PICTURE HAN THREE FRENCH HANS TWO TURTLE DOVES IND PARTINITURES IN THEN FOUR CALLING BIRDS THREE FRIENCH HANS TWO TURTLE DOVES IN A PARTH OF THE FIVE GOLDEN RINGS FOR COING BORTHS AN JUS LIKE SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S REPETITIOUS IN THE MOST BORING WAY AND THEN IT'S ALWAYS SUNG VERY SLOWLY WHICH IS ANNOYING AND I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S SURVIVE HUNDREDS OF YEARS TO STILL BE AROUND AND AND MY ONLY THOUGHT IS FIVE GOLDEN RINGS FIVE GOLDEN RINGS IS THE HOOK OF THE SONG AND YOU SONG THE SONG RIGHT WHEN YOU GET TO FIVE GOLDEN RINGS EVERYBODY FREES A SIVRYS AS LIKE F ORING AND JUST FO LIKE YYOU ONLY MAN IT'S LIKE THE TRUMS THAT'S THE HOOK OF THE SAW AND WITHOUT FIVE GOLDEN RINGS THIS SONG WOULD BE NOTHING IGISA AT THIS POINT THIS ME BACK IN THE STRUDIO TUGGING IT THIS MONT

FIRES SOMETIMES FROM ALARMING HEIGHTS UNDERNEATH TREES AND BASKEBALL HOOPS OF COURSE THEREIS A SUBJON R HERE OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WIND UP CATCHING THEIR DECKS ON FIRE AND FLY INTO A PANIC JUST SAYING YOURE AVERAGE TURKEY FIRE INCIDENT INJURES FOUR PEOPLE FOR BECAUSE IT'S A SPECTATOR SPORTS WHICH IS WHY FIRE DEPARTMENTS DO THESE FITIAS EVER HEAR  BUT AFTER MY SEVENTH TIME WATCHING WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER DEEP FRIRE TURKEY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THEREIS ANOTHER REASON WHY THEY DO THEM I NOTICE ONE OF THE FIREFIGHTERS STANDING IN THE BACK HE WAS BARELY SUPPRESSING A GRIN ASSUMED IN ON HAM WATCHD IT AGAIN DEFINITELY AGRANT SO I CALLED HIM TO ASK ABOUT IT HIS NAME IS LIEUTENANT DANIEL ACRAMEN OF THE SCANBY COUNTY FIRE RESCUE THAT IN ONE OF THE HIGLIG TO BEIN IN  TE OFIS WHEN YOU ACY DROT

SOMEBODY WHO NOT ONLY SEES SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE SEES WHEN HE TELLS OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THE STUFF SHE SEES THEY DON'T BUY IT INVESTIGATVE REPORTER DAVID EPSTINE EXPLAINS I WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE SPORTS GNE IT'S PARDLY ABOUT HOW SOME SUPER ATHLETES ARE GENETICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF US THEY HAVE SUPERGNES THEI'RE PHYSIOLOGICAL FREAKS I WAS DALUGED WITH EMALES FROM PARENTS WANTING TO KNOW HOW THEY COULD FIND OUT IF THEIR CHILD HAD MICHAEL GEORGAN GINES A COACH WROTE OFFERING UP HIS PLAYERS AS GUINEA PIGS FOR GENETIC EXPERIMENTATION THERE WERE SO MANY UNHINGED EMALES COMING IN THAT I PRETTY MUCH STOPPED OPENING THEM AND THEN I GOT THIS ONE THAT HAD THE SUBJECT HEADING O LYMPIC METALIST AND MUSCULAR DISTRIOPI PATIONT WITH THE SAME MUTATION I OPENED IT FIGURING IT WOULD BE A LINK TO SOME ARTICLE THAT I'D MISSED IN MY REPORTING INSTEAD IT WAS A NOTE FROM A THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD IOA MOTHER HER NAME WAS GILL VILES SHE WAS THE MUSCULAR DISTREFUPATION AND SHE HAD A WILD THEORY LINKING HER GENES TO AN OLYMPIC SPRINTER NAMED PRISCILLA LOPES SHLEET AND SHE WANTED TO SEND MORE INFO SHIRE I SAID SEND IT ALONG WHY NOT DAYS LATER A PACKAGE ARRIVED A NINETEEN PAGE ILLUSTRATED BOUND PACKET IT THUMBED THROUGH IT ET WAS A LITTLE WEIRD HAND DRAWN DIAGRAMS WITH CUT OUTS OF LITTLE CARTOON WEIHTLIFTERS REPRESENTING PROTINE MOLECULES OLD PHOTOS OF HERSELF IN HER SIBLINGS THE ORIGINAL PICTURES NOT COPIES THERE WAS A DETAILED MEDICAL HISTORY AND HE WAS CLEAR SHE KNEW SOME SERIOUS SCIENCE SHE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL HOW PROTINES FUNCTION SHE REFERR TO GENIUTATIONS BY THEIR SPECIFIC DEANA ADDRESSERS THE WAY A SCIENTIST WOULD AND THEN I LANDED ON PAGE FOURTEEN THERE WERE TWO PHOTOS ONE OF GILL IN A ROYAL BLUE BIKINY SITTING ON A BEACH HER TORSO LOOKS NORMAL BUT HER ARMS IT'S LIKE THE'RE ON THE WRONG BODY LIKE THE STICK ARMS ON A SNOW MAN HER LEGS TOO ARE SO THIN THAT HER KNEE JOINT IS WIDER THAN HER THIGH THOSE LEGS CAN'T POSSIBLY HOLD HER UPRIGHT I THOUGHT THE OTHER PICTURE WAS OF PRISCILLA LOPE SHLEEP WHO' BEEN RANKED THE BEST HURTLER IN THE WORLD IND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SHE WON THE BRONZE METAL IN THE ONE HUNDRED METER HURTLES AT THE OLYMPICS AN BASANE IN THE PHOTO SHE'S IN MID STRIDE IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE JUST HOW MUSCULAR SHE LOOKS ICTURE ALL THE MUSCLES YOUCAN IMAGINE ON A WOMAN NOW PICTURE MORE IN THAT PHOTO PRISCILLAS LIKE THE VISION OF A SUPER HERO THAT A THIRD GRATER MIGHT DRAW HUGE MUSCLES BURSTING FROM HER THIYES LIKE HER SKIN CAN BARELY CONTAIN ALL THE POWER BENEATH IT ROPY VENES SNAKING ALONG HER BYSEDS THIS IS THE WOMAN GILL BELIEVED SHE SHARED THE SAME TO HAT AC JILL WS TOLL LE MIS JILL REMEMBERHIS ARMS AND LEGS AR LIKETEIO  ALL JILL'S LIFE DOCTORS HAD BEEN MYSTIFIED BY HER CASE THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW HER MUSCLE DISEASE WORK MUCH LESS OUT A TREATED SHE DID KNOW HER DISEASE CAME FROM ARARGE AN TAMUTATION AND SHE WANTED TO REACH PRISCILLA BECAUSE LOOKING AT PHOTOES OF PRISCILLA SEEING HER BODY SHE SAW CLUES THAT MADE HER BELIEVE PRISCILLA HAD THE SAME MUTATION IF PRISCILLA DID IF JILL WAS RIGHT AND SCIENTISTS MIGHT FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS MAKING JILL'S MUSCLES SHRINK IN PRISCILLA'S MUSCLES BALLOON AND MAYBE PEOPLE LIKE JILL COULD SOME DAY BE HELP THE WHOLE THING SEEMED LIKE A LONGSHOT SO I REACHED OUT TO ROBERT GREEN AT JENETICISTAD HARVARD WHO HAD GOT TO KNOW WHILE WRITING MY BOOK HE'S AN IMPORTANT PROPONENT OF PEOPLE BEING ALLOWED TO GET THEIR OWN GENETITESTS UT AFTER LOOKING AT THE PICTURES OF JILL AN PRISCILLA HE THOUGHT JILL WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY WRONG HE DOUBTED THEY HAD ANYTHING IN COMMON AND SCIENCE THE SIDE HE HAD OTHER CONCERNS FOR ONE THING YOU KNOW US A SOMEWHAT FAMOUS ATHILET AH JUST LIKE ANY OTHER A CELEBRITY CAN WE COME THE FOCAL POINT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL FOR VARIOUS REASONS IN A VERY UNHEALTHY WAY I WAS CONCERNED THAT AN POWER ING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO WOMEN COULD A IN BADLY YEH I MEAN YOU KNOW PEOPLE GO OFF THE DEEP IN WHEN THEY ARE RELATING TO CELEBRITIES THEY THINK THEY HAVE A CONNECTION TO OF COURSE THIS A VERY POLITE WAY OF SAYING MAYBE SHE'S A NUT JOB I WONDERED THE SAME THING HOW COULD YOU NOT THE I DEA THET NIWA HOUSEWIFE WORKING OFF GUGAL IMAGES WOULD MAKE A MEDICAL DISCOVERY ABOUT A PROFESSIONAL LATHLE WHOSE BODY HAS BEN OBSESSIVELY EXAMINED FOR YEARS BY A SMALL ARMY OF DOCTORS AND HAT LETIC TRAINERS IT SEEME PRETTY LUDICROUS BUT THE FACT IS HEOPLE WITH EMDS AND PH DES HADE BEEN TELLING JILL THAT HER THEORIES ARE LUDICROUS PRETTY MUCH HER WHOLE LIFE JILL WAS BORN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AT FIRST EVERYTHING WAS GREAT SHE MET ALL THE NORMAL BABY MILESTONES SHE SAT CRAWLED AND WALKED ON TIME THEN IT AGE FOUR SHE STARTED STUMBLING AND TRIPPING ALL THE TIME CONSTANTLY FALLING FLAT ON HER FACE I WOULD DESCRIBED THIS FEAR I HAD ABOUT WITCHES FINGERS THIS IS JILL AND YOU KOW MY MAMA'S KIND OF PUZZLED WHAT WHAT WAS I TALKING BOUT WITCHE'S FINGERS WHAT DO YOU MEAN AND WHEN WE WALK TI FELL THE SENSATION ALMOST LIKE THEY WERE LITTLE THEY WERE NARL HANDS AND FINGERS REACHING UP AND GRAVING MY SHINS THAT I'D FALLVERLY FORCEPILY THAT WAS KIND OF TO BEGINNING OF NOTICING SOMETHING WITSTEFFEREN JILL'S DAD REMEMBERED THAT HE'D HAD SOME PROBLEMS WALKING AROUND THE SAME AGE WHICH HIS DOCTORS SAID WAS THE RESULT OF A VERY MILD CASE OF POLEO BUT JILL'S TROUBLES WERE MUCH WORSE THAN HER DADS HAD EVER BEEN AND NO ONE COULD GIVE THEM AN ANSWER HER PETY ATRICIAN WAS STUMPED HE SUGGESTED THEY TAKE HER TO THE MAIL CLINIC THEY WERE STUMPED THERE TOO THEY TESTED THE WHOLE FAMILY AND FOUND THAT JIL AND HER BROTHER AND HER DAD ALL HAD SIGNS OF MUSCLE DAMAGE BUT JILL WAS THE ONLY ONE HAVING TROUBLE WALKING IT MIGHT BE MUSCULAR DISTROPHY THE DOCTORS THOUGHT BUT THAT DIDN'T USUALLY SHOW UP THIS WAY AND LITTLE GIRLS THEY WERE REALLY REALLY A SIR THEYD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS THEY SAID OUR FAMILY WAS EXTREMELY YOU NEEK AND THEY COULDN'T DEFIND WHAT TIHT BUT WAS YOU KNAL ELTIMALY THAT'S GOOD AND ONE WAY BECAUSE THERE BEING ONEST BUT IN THE OTHER HAND OF IS TERRIFYING WHAT IS MY LIFE EXPECTANCY WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS THAT ALL BE JEALING WITH IT'S ALARMING YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO GRASP TE HOLD OF JILL WENT BACK TO THE MAIL CLINIC EVERY YEAR AND IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME THERE WAS NOTHING THE DOCTORS COULD DO NOTHING KNEW THEY COULD TELL HER THEY CONSTANT FALLING EVENTUALLY STOPPED BUT WAS REPLACED BY A BURNING SENSATION IN HER LEGS AND WILE SHE WAS GROWING IN HEIGHT LIKE A NORMAL GIRL THE FAT ON HE ARMS AND LEGS WAS VANISHING BY THE TIME SHE WAS EIGHT HER ARMS AND LEGS WERE SO SKINNY THAT OTHER KIDS COULD RAPPE THEIR FINGERS AROUND HER WRISTS AND ANKLES BY AGE TWELVE VEINS WERE BOPPING OUT OF HER LEGS HIDS ASKED HOW IT FELL TO THE OLD AND THEN HER MUSCLES STARTED TO FAIL AGAIN I CONMEMBER JUST GETTNG IN A BIKE I DALWAYS RIDDEN AND FEELING LIKE SOMEONE CAME UP BEHIND ME AND JUST THREW ME INTO THE HANDLEBARS AND GOT A BIG RUWS ACROSS MY CEST FROM OU KNOW I FALL SO WHERE TO COULDEN POLD MY SELF OVER TH THE BIKE I JUST START  MY MUSCLES THUCH AS STAR QUIVERING AND ROLLERS KAININ I INVITED A FRIEND TO GO WITH ME AND I CAME EVEN STAND UP ON THE SGATES AND I'M JUST SITTING HERE GOING SOMEIN IS JUS SOMETHINS TERRIBLY WRONG HOW RAPIT HOW QUICK WAS THAT THAT YOU TASICALLY LOST THE ABILITY TO RULLDER STADEN IN RYJER BEG I WAS SAY PUBLIC WITHIN A FEW WEEKS O   JILDED EVEN BOTHERED TELL HER PARENTS WHAT WAS HAPPENING SHE KNEW THERE WAS NOTHING THERE THE DOCTORS COULD DO ABOUT I BY THE END OF THAT SUMMER THE SYMPTOMS ES DONE SHE COULD WALK O PAY AGAIN SHE STARTED LOOKING FOR ANSWERS ON HER OWN BUT SHE DID IT THE WAY A KIDWOULD YOU KNOWI'M HAVING MY BODY DO THINGS THAT I CAN'T CONTROL FORCES ARE ACTING ON ME AND I DEVELOPS CURIOSITY FASCINATION WITH THINGS LIKE I WOULD READ ABOUT POLTER GEISE AND I WOULD BRING HOME LOTS OF BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY AH I REMEMBER IT REALLY FRORKE GOT MY DAD AT ONE POINT CAS HE YOU KNOW TIPPED OVER MY BOOK BAG AND THERE'S ALL THESE BOOKS ABOUT SUPERNATURAL THINGS AND HE WAS LIKE WHA YOU IN TO THE ACCOLTER WHAT ONE OUT IT WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT IT WAS ABOUPS I COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ME THE DOCTORS COULDN'T EXPLAIN AND I FOUND THESE PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THEM TOTALLY FASCINATING AH I BELIEVE IM    BY THE TIMES SHOMENT TO COLLEGE SHELAD MAXED OUT AT FIVE FOOR THREE IN ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN POUNDS SHE DECIDED THAT IF SHE WAS GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH HER BODY SHE'D HAVE TO DO IT HERSELF SO DURINGGILL'S FIRST SOMASTER SHE SET UP CAMP IN THE LIBRARY SHE BEGAN PORING OVER EVERY TEXT BOOK AND SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL ARTICLE SHE COULD FIND ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSCLE DISEASE SO I JUST THAT WHILE ELL STAR READING ABOUT THEM ONE BY ONE AND SEE IF SOMETHING FITS SHE DID THIS FOR MONTHS GOING ARTICLE BY ARTICLE LIKE A POLICE OFFICER DRIVING UP AND DOWN EVERY STREET DOING A GRID SEARCH BUT NOTHING REALLY FIT UNTIL SHE CAME TO A PAGE IN A MEDICAL JOURNAL ABOUT AN EXTREMELY RARE TYPE OF MUSCULAR DISTROPE CALLED EMERI DRIFUS AND THEN LOOKING AT THE PICTURES I WAS A VERY STARTLING THING TO REALISE I'ME SEE IN MY DANDS ARM JUST AN INSTANTANEOUS LOCK ON SOMETHING THAT'S IN YOUR VISUAL MEMORY BUT WHAT DID YOU SAY AS THE LITTLE GIRL I WOULD AH NOTICE HE HAD WHAT I CALLED PAPI ARMS BIG FOREARM AND HAND MUSCLES AND THEN AT I'M READING ABOUT EVERY DRIFEAS THEY ACTUALLY DESCRIBE THE LOOK OF THE ARMS AS A PAPI ARM TO FARMADY BUT YOU KNOW THERE WERE VERY VERY FEW FOTOES OF WOMEN WITH IM MRIH DRIF AS MUSTCULAR GESTRPE THE JOURNAL DESCRIBED AT THE THREE HAL MARKS OF EMORY DRIFIS PATIENCE THEY COULDN' TUST THEIR CHINS THEIR CHESTS OR THEIR HEELS TO THE FLOOR AND HER ARMS WERE PE PETUALLY BENT AT THE ELBOW AND I OU KNOW GET CHILLS READIDN THIS THIN CAN LIVE GOT ALL THREE AH A REALLY GREAT VISUAL TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS SHOCKINGLY A A BARBY DON THAT IS ELBOWS TAT DON'T BEND AND FEET SLANTED TO FIT INTO HIGH HEELS ACTUALLY AS A TERREFIC REPRESENTATION OF WHAT TOES THE MERY DRIFAS LOOK LIKE WHICH IS VERY IRONIC AS WE GET THIS TO LITTLE GIRL SINCE THEY THIS IS PERFECT AND WHERE ACTUALLY HANDING THEM A DOLL THAT HAS TENEN'T IN DISORDER  SO WHEN YOU FLIP OPEN YOU AND YOU SEE THESE PICTURES AND SEE THESE DESCRIPTIONS IS IT LIKE THE LIKEBALL JUST SLIPPED ON IN THIS IS IT DELIBL I I WAS SURE IT'S IT'S ERY I S GREAT BUT AS TERRIFYING  A WHAT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING WAS TO READ THERS TO A LOT OF CARDIACISHEIS SIN VOLV IT THIS DISEASE EMIRY DRIVE IS PATIENCE JE LEARNED OFTEN DROPED DEAD OF HEARTFAILURE SHE BECAME OBSES WITH READING ABOUT IT BEFORE SHE WENT HOME FOR COLLEGE BREAK SHE STUFFED HER BAG FULL OF MEDICAL BOOKS AND JOURNAL ARTICLES  PURPOSELY EVEN HIT THEM UNDER SEVERAL BOOKS CAUSE I DIDN'T WONE O ALARM ANYBODY AT HOME AND I WENT OUT IN THE KITCHEN LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE MY CROY POP CORN AND I CAME BACK IN TO MY MY DAT WAS READING THEM ND I TRIED TO TAKE HIM AWAY AND I LIKE JUS DON'T YOU NOW DON'T READ THOSE AND HE WAS REALLY SUCKED INTO IT AND HE SAID WLE I I HAVE ALL THESE SYMPTHEMS ND I SAID WOLLYA I KNOW THE ARM THING AND THE YOU KNOW THE NAK AND AND HE SAID NO HE SAID I HAVE ALL THESE CARDIACCEMPTEMS HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT THE STIFFNESS IN HIS MUSCLES AND HART TROUBLES WERE UNRELATED HE SAID WHALL THE DOCTORS TOLD ME I HAD O VIRUS NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT WE BOTH JUST LOOKED EACH OTHER IN I SAID YOU DON'T IT'S NOT A VIRUS IT'S THIS WE HAVE O MORY DRITHUS THEY WENT TO THE I WI HEARTSENTER WHERE DOCTORS PUT A HEART MONITOR ON JEAL'S FATHER HIS POLSE RATE DROPPED BELOW THIRTY BEATS PERMINNUTE WHICH MEANT HE WAS EITHER ABOUT TO WIN THE TOUR TO FRANCE OR HE WAS ABOUT TO DROP DID HE HAD A PACEMAKER PUT IN IMMEDIATELY SHE SAFED YOUR DANCE LIFE I MEAN JUST ABSY AMAZING THIS IS JILS MA'M MARY BUT WASN'T FOR HER HOW OUD WE'VE EVER KNOWNNESS AM AND I Y I REMEMBER BEING IN THE HOSPITAL THAT DAY AND I I THINK HE IS JUST YN AW OF J AND HE YOU KNOW JUST LOVE TOTAL DON'T LOVE FOR CELL BUT I THINK WAS A HARD BURDEN FOR HER BECAUSE IT JUST SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW WY NELSE WAS LOKING  THE IE HARD CENTER WASN'T SET UP TO CONFIRM WHETHER NOT HER FAMILY AD EMIRY DRIFES THAT WASN'T THEIR SPECIALTY SO SHE WENT LOOKING FOR SOME ONE WHO COULD REMEMBER SHE WAS NINETEEN WELL I WENT TO A NEROLOGY CLENEK A I CAN REMEMBER EVEN WHAT I WORE THAT DAY I DRESSED UP AS PROFESSIONAL AS I COULD I WANTED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY I MEAN I I HAD NOT A NAVY PANCSE UT AND TRIED TO PRESENT THE ARTICLES TO MY A NEROLOGIS AND HOW DID YOUVEN START THAT CONVERSATIO HOWD YOU MAKE YOUR CASE I JUST SAID I'D BEEN STUDYING TO NECS AID MIS FUNDING A GREAT DILL A TIME IN THE LIBRARY AND I'VE COME ACROSS THESE PHOTOS AND IAM SURE THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE AND THIS IS THIS IS THE NAME AND COULD YOU LOOK AT THESE WITH ME AND THE DOCTOR JUST WAS VERY ABRUFT WITH ME AND SAID NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT AND REFUSE TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS IT MIGHT SEEM RUDE THAT A DOCTOR WOULD REFUSE EVEN TO LOOK BUT AT THE TIME MOST DOCTORS BELIEVED EMORY DRIFIS ONLY OCCURRED IN MEN ALSO THIS WAS A SELF DIAGNOSIS COMING FROM A TEA NAGURE A DEFIANT TEA NAGUR THERE WAS TIMES THAT WHEN I WAS IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE I WOULD SEE MY CHART AND IT WUL JUST LIST DIGNOSIS MUSCULAR DISTERPY I KNOWN EDIOLOGY I HATED SEEING THAT I LETTERALLY JUST TAKE A PEN ON ON MY PERSOND I SCRATCH IT OUT AND I'D WRIT AM I DRIFIS MUSCULAR JUSTRPY AND MY MA WOULD SEE ME THOU THA TICK C NOT CAN'T PANCH YOUR CHART AND YOU KNOW I I WANTED LIST AD WHAN I HAVE IN HER READING BIN SHE WOULD COME ACROSS A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS WORKING OUT OF ITALY THEY WERE LOOKING FOR FAMILIES WITH EMIRY DRIFES TO STUDY HOPING TO LOCATE THE JANE THAT CAUSES THE DISEASE JE'LL DECIDED TO WRITE TO THEM SHE MAPPED OUT AF FAMILY TREE NOTING THE SYMPTOMS SHE SAW IN HER FATHER TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS AND A YOUNGER SISTER THEN SHE STRIPPED DOWN TO HER UNDERWAR AND THAT I SET THE TIMER ON MY CAMERA AND I TOOK PICTURES OF MY SELF CAUSE I THOUGHT WILL IF THAT'S HOW I ADDENTIFIED IT ONLY SEND A PICTURE  AND JUST INQUIRED WOULD YOU ONE TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FAMILY UP TO THIS POINT THE ITALIANS HAD ONLY COLLECTED FOUR OTHER FAMILIES TO STUDY SO THEY WERE THRILLED TO HEAR FROM JILL AND THEY IMMEDIATELY WROTE BACK FROM THE LETTER IT SEEMS LIKE THEY THINK SHE'S A SCIENTISTS WHO HAS ACCESS TO A LAB THEY ASKED CAN YOU SEND AS D'ONEE IF YOU CANNOT PREPARE D'ONEE JUST SEND FRESH BLOOD BUT NINETEEN YEAR OLD GILL SOON LEARNED YOY CAN'T JUST GO TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL AND SAY DRAW MY BLOOD I WANT A CENDED TO EUROPE SOD JILL CON VINCED A NURSE FRIEND TO SMUGGLE NEELS AND TESTUBES TO HER HOUSE THEY FILLED THEM UP WITH SAMPLES OF HER FAMILY'S BLOOD AND SHIPPED THEM OFF TO ITALY TO DAY YOU CAN SEQUENCE AN ENTIRE GENOMIN A FEW DAYS BUT BACK IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES NOT SO MUCH IT WAS FOUR YEARS BEFORE JLL HEARD SOMETHING DEFINITIVE BACK FROM THE ITALIANS THEY CONFIRMED SHE HAD EMORY DRIPHES SHE'D BEEN WRIGHT ALL THESE YEARS DESPITE EVERYONE TELLING HER OTHERWISE ONE DAY I OPEN EME AND THERE A WAS AND THAT WAS A WEIRD FEELING TO REALIZED TO E THIS IS IT I CLLICE DON ET AND THEY TELL ME THAT NAME OF THE GE END OF ITS NECLARE LAMB AND THE RESEARCHERS HAD DISCOVERED THE GENETIC CAUSE OF JILL'S ILLNESS A GENE CALLED THE LAMANGENE WHAT MAKES THE LAM AN GENE REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT IT EFFECTS THE COMMAND CENTER INSIDE EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY THIS TURNS OTHER GENES ON AND OFF LIKE LIGHT SWITCHES CHANGING THE WAY THEY BUILD FAT AND MUSCLE JILL'S LAM AN GENE HAS A TYPO IN IT A SERIOUS ONE ALONG THE SPIRALLING LADDERS OF HER DEONEE THE THREE BILLION GES TES AS AND SEAS THAT MAKE UP JILL'S GENO SHE HAD ONE LETTER IN THE WRONG PLACE AND IT'S JUS ALMOST DARKLY COMICAL TO THINK SERIOUSLY AND ON THIS CLESS TO FIND OUT CABLE WHAT HAPPEN EXACTLY AT IT COMES DOWN TO A GEOU AS CHANGE TO AS THIN SOON AFTER JI'LL GOT AN INTERNSHIP IN A LABIT JOHN'S HOPKINS THAT WAS MAPPING DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAMON GENE THE LAB DIRECTOR HAD HEARD ABOUT JILL'S RESEARCH ON HERSELF AND SAW A CHANCE TO HAVE NOT ONLY A DOGGED INTERN IN THE LAB BUT ALSO THEIR VERY OWN REAL LIFE LAMON MUTIN JILL'S JOB WAS TO SIFT THROUGH SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND FIND ANY REFERENCES THAT HAD BEEN LINKED TO A LAMON MUTATION SITTING THEIRE DAY AFTER DAY READING SHE CAME ACROSS AN INCREDIBLY RARE DISEASE A DISORDER CALLED PARTIAL LIPODISTROPHY IY CAUSES THE ARMS AND LEGS TO LOOK AS IF ALL THE FAT ON THEM HAS BEEN MELTED AWAY LEAVING VEINES AND MUSCLE TO STAND OUT LOOKING AT PHOTOS OF PATIENCE WITH THE DISEASE ALL JILL COULD THINK WAS THAT THESE PEOPLE LOOKED LIKE HER FAMILY MEMBERS COULD JILLIN HER FAMILY HAVE NOT JUST ONE BUT TWO RARE GENETIC DISEASES THE ODDS OF GETTING ONE OF THEM WAS ONE IN A MILLION THE ODDS OF GETTING THE OTHER IS ONE IN AT LEAST A MILLION AND THE ODDS OF GETING BOTH TO GETHER THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH HUMAN BEINGS IN TH HISTORY OF OUR SPECIES THAT ANY ONE SHOULD EVER GET BOTH SO JUST LIKE BEFORE WHEN JILL DISCOVERED EMORY TRIPHES SHE ZEROED IN ON A PHOTO IN A MEDICAL ARTICLE AND SAW HERSELF IN IT AND JUST LIKE BEFORE SHE TRIED TO GET CONFIRMATION FROM DOCTORS SHE TRIED TO TELL SCIENTISTS THAT SHE HAD THE SECOND RARE DISORDER PARTIAL LIKE ODISTROPHY AND JUST LIKE BEFORE THEY SAID NO THEY SAID THAT STATISTICALLY THERE WAS VERY LITTLE CHANCE THAT COULD BE TRUE INSTEAD THEY DIGED NOST HER WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE COMMON THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY LAUGH AT ME BUT WERE KIND OF INCREDULOUS THAT NO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT AND THEVEN KAND IT DESCRIBED IT IS  INTERNCE IN DRUM WHERE YOU HAVE A MEDICAL STUDEND THAT'S BEING INTRODUCE TO  LATED NOU DISEASES AND THE CON THINK IN THEY HAVE WHAT THEY'RE READING ABOUT I JUST THOUGHT WELL I MUST BE WRONG I THINK I TO IS BUYING AN TO THAT IDEA THAT THAT'S QUITE A REAGE TO THEY THEY YEN THE SECOND TONATIC DISORDER BECAUSE IT'S A RARE TOO I JUST KIND O THOT WILE MEY BEM  AN I NOT TO I KIND OF BACK TOWAY FROM THAT EVEN THO  LES KIND OF A DAEOT WO FEELING SO SHE DROPPED IN SHE STOPPED READING ABOUT THIS NEW DISEASE AND BEFORE LONG SHE STOPPED DOING RESEARCHING TO EMRY DRIFIST TOO MOSTLY BECAUSE THE RESEARCH SHE WAS DOING STARTED TO FREEK HER OUT IN THE CASE STUDIES SHE READ THE AVERAGE PERSON WITH EMERY DRIFIS WAS DEAD BY THEIR EARLY FORTIES SHE WAS TWENTY FIVE AN ANXIETY OVER THIS WAS LANDING HER IN THE HOSPITAL I HAD TO PANIC ATTACKS THAT WERE BROUGHT ON BY THE STRESS OF READING ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT THEY JUST DIED SUDDONLY AND I WENT TO A COUNCIL FOR A WHILE I WORKED WITH MY CARDIOLOGIST AND WE DECIDED IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH INFORMATION IT WASN'T HEALTHY SO I REALLY  JUST DIDN'T LOOK UP THINGS DIDN'T READ ARTICLES AND I REALLY GOT TO THE POINT THAT I DESIDED I WANT TO GO ON WITH MY OWN LIFE SO SHE WENT COLD TURKEY NO MORE MEDICAL RESEARCH NO MORE DEI WHY DIAGNOSIS SHE TOOK A JOB AS A WRITING INSTRUCT OR AT LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLOGIST AND TAUGHT A DULL EDUCATION CLASSES AT NIGHT SHE STARTED DATING EVENTUALLY MEETING THE MAN WHO WOULD BECOME HER HUSBAND AND EVEN THOUGH THER WAS A FIFTYF FIFTY CHANCE THAT SHE WOULD PASS ON THE EMERY DRIFIS GENIUTATION THEY DECIDED TO HAVE A CHILD HER PREGNANCY WAS NORMAL AND HER BABY MARTIN DOESN'T HAVE THE DISEASE BUT AFTER HE WAS BORN JILLRALLY DETERIORATED PHYSICALLY IF YOU EVER HAD A MUSCLE TO WHICH YOU KNOW HOW STRANGE IT FEELS DOD NOT HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR BODY JILL'S MUSCLES STARTED TWITCHING FROM HEAD TO TO SOMETIMES FOR HOURS AT A TIME AND SHE WAS SUDDENLY HAVING TO HOLD ON TO HER HUSBAND TO STEADY HERSELF THE BEST WHAT I CAN DESCRIBE WITH WHAT IT WAS LIKE IT WOULD BE LIKE WHERE GRAVITY IS GETTING INCREDIBLY HEAVY AND IT'S SOME MICE TURNS UP THE KNOB AND YOU KNOW YOU THINK OF HOW HIGHWOULD THEY HAVE TO TURN UP THIS GRAVITY THAT I CAN'T GET UP OFF THE FLOOR BY MYSELF I CAN'T STAND UP RIGHT I CAN'T TAKE A STEP YOU KNW IT'S IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FORESE PUSHING ON THE BODY BY MARTIN'S FIRST BIRTHDAY SHE COULD BARELY WALK ONE DAY HE WAS CALLIN THAT HE WANTED MACARONY AND CHEESE AND A I KNEW I I WAS YEN I'D LIKE SIX STEPS TO TAKE MY I REALIZE THIS IS THA THIS IS THIT THIS VLAS SIX STEPS OM GANO TAY I I JUST KNEW AS THAT THAT POINT THAT I WAS NOT BE ABLE TO GET UP AGAIN AT THE SAME TIME JILL'S FATHER WAS ALSO LOSING HIS BILITY TO WALK SO FATHER AND DAUGHTER TRANSITION TO LIFE IN MOTOR IZE SCOUTORS JILS AYS HER DAD WAS DISCOURAGED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE AFTER A VISIT WITH AN HEROLOGIST HE TOLD HER I FEEL LIKE I GO THERE JUST TO BE WAGED THEN ONE DAY SHE GOT A CALL FROM MERMAM AND IT WAS ABOUT DAD HE JUST MOVED FROM HIS SCHOTER INTO HIS FAVOURITE CHAIR HE SAID TO MY MOM HE JUST FELT TIRED AND THEN HE SIMPLY JUST FOUND AS HADN'N HE DIDN'T BREATHE AGAIN AND HE DIE HE HAD A SUDDEN CARDIACTA AT WHAT AGE WAS IT HE WAS SIXTY THREE ON THE DAY HE PASSED AWAY JILLIN ER TIBBLINGS AND RELATIVES GATHERED AT HER PARENTS HOUSE AFTER MULSE PEOPLE AT GONE IF HIS CONSLOWING DOWN AND MY SISTERS SAID I GOT I GOT THIST TUST SHOW YOU SHE STARTS PULLING UP PICTURES OF THIS EXTREMELY MUSCULAR ATHLY AND I JUST TOOK O LOOK AT IT JUST KIND OF WET WE DON'T WHA WOU KNON'T WE DON'T HAVE THAT I ME WHANT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS OF COURSE WAS PRISCILLA AT FIRST JILL DIDN'T GET IT DIDN'T SEE ANY CONNECTION WITH THE MUSCLE BOUND ATHLEE IT HAD BEN TWELVE YEARS SINCE SHE WENT COLD TURKEY ON MEDICAL RESEARCH BUT A WEEK LATER JILL GOT CURIOUS SHE STARTED GOUGLING PICTURES OF PRISCILLA NOT JUST RUNTING PHOTOS BUT SHOTS OF HER HOME DOING REGULAR THINGS LIKE FEEDING HER DAUGHTER BABY FOOD IT HELPED SEEING THE CLOTHING ON HER TO SEE HOW IT FIT IT WAS JUST UNMISTAKEABLE IT'S LIKE A PEWTER THAT COULD ANALIZE A PHOTOGRAPH AND GET A MATCH AND BE A HUNDRED PER CENT SURE THAT'S THE SAME SHOULDER THAT'S THE SAME UPPER ARM I SEE THE SAME VEINS I SEE THEM BRANCHING THIS WAY HE JUST KNOW AND THAT'S HARD TO C ONVAY HOW COULD SHE JUST NOW BUT I KNEW UT WE WERE VERY LIKELY CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH A VERY VERY VERY RARE CLOTH IT WAS THE THIRD TIME JIL SAW SOMETHING IN A PHOTO OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE IT HAD HAPPENED WITH EMORY DRYFIS IT HAPPENED WITH LYPODISTROPHY NOW SHE SAW THAT SHE AND PRISCILLA WERE BOTH MISSING FAT IN THE SAME PLACES ON THEIR ARMS AND LEGS THEY HAD THE EXACT SAME MUSCLE DIVISIONS IN THE EXACT SAME PLACES IN THE HIPS AND BUD JIL WAS CERTAIN THIS WAS BECAUSE THEY SHARED A MUTEGENE AND THE ONLY QUESTION WAS WHY DID THE JENE BLOW UP PRISCILLA WITH MUSCLES AND TAKE GILLS AWAY THIS IS MY CRIP TO NIG BUT IT'S HER ROCKET FEL I ME WERE WE'RE LIKE YOU KNOW CONMAC BOOK SUPERHERE AS THAT ARE JUST AS DIVERGENT AS COULD BE I MEAN O HER BODY HAS FOUND AWAY AROUND IT SOMEHOW I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE PLOT OF A HOLLY WOULD MOVY IN FACT IT'S TOTALLY THE PLOT OF UNBREAKABLE THE BRUCE WILLI'S SAMUEL ELL JACKSON FILM JACKSON PLAYS A BROKEN BONE PHYSICALLY FRAGILE MAN SEARCHING FOR HIS GENETIC OPPOSITE A MAN BORN SO STRONG HIS BODY WILL SURVIVE ANY PHYSICAL DRAMA IN FINAL SCENE JACKSON TELLS WILLIS THAT HE'S TH GI T A ASO SE WANTED TO ENLIST PRISCILLA AN HER GENETIC DETECTIVE WORK BUT THERE WAS A PRACTICAL PROBLEM SHE HAD NO IDEA HOW TO GO ABOUT REACHING HER MAY NI'VE HAD CRAZY IDEAS LIKE CAN I FLY A CANDIDAT SHEL UP AT A MEATIN GREET AND TRY TO TALK TO HER AN IT'S IIF YOU ERE ON THIS MOTER I COOTER AND IT'S LIKE YENOW YOU'E JUST CONNENTE THERE RESTRAINING ORDER AT BEST I MADE PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU ARE CRAZY YOU KNOW I WAS JUST TRYING TO RESIGN MYSELF TO THE FACT THAT WELL YOU KNOW WHAT AM I GOING TO DELL A FULL YEAR PAST AND THEN JILL HAPPEN TO BE AN EAR SHOT OF HER TELL OVISION WHEN I STARTED YAMMERING ABOUT ATHLETES AND GENETICS ON DISMOINING AMERICA FIND THE BEST FIT FOR YOUR UNIQUE GENO AND THEN SPECIAL IYES IN THET MIDTENIARS AN THAT ALL TIS IS JUST THE PATTERN  THIS IS JUST  IF I OTNANCE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR JILL REACHED OUT TO ME WITH A REQUEST AND I DID HAPPENED TO HAVE A WAY TO GET IT TO PRISCILLA THROUGH HER AGENT IT WAS SUCH A ODD REQUEST IS IS REALLY OUT THERE IH THIS OF COURSE IS PRISCILLA IM HE IS JUST LIKE THIS LADY SHEIS AND I WA I JUST AS SHE HAS THE SAME GENE AS YOU AND ONCE HAVE A CONVERSATION I WAS IN LIKE I DO NO CRESS AN ES HAVE A CONVERSATION LIKE SEE WERE GOS JILL SON PRISCILLA THE SAME BOUND PACKET THAT SHE SENT ME AND IT WASN'T ANY OF THE CRYPTIC SCIENCE

THE VEINS REMOVE FOM MY LEGS BECAUSE I ON THE WAYS ARE MAKING FUN OF ME JUST LIE ALLOR LEGS AR VAINY YOU LIKEWISE IT LOOK LIKE THAT ONCE SHE GREW UP THE FINGER POINTING DID ANT END IT JUST MORFED WHEN PEOPLE SEE HUGE SHREDDED MUSCLES LIKE PRISCILLAS ON AN ATHLETE IT USUALLY MEANS ONE THING STEREROIDS AND PRISCILLA'S BEEN DOGGED BY DOPING RUMORS SINCE COLLEGE AFTER SHE WON THE OLYMPIC BRONZE METAL AND BEJENE SOME MEDIA OUTLETS IN EUROPE BEGAN TO OPENLY ACCUSE HER AND OF COURSE THERE WAS A NOT SO FURTIVE GLANCES M YOU'D WALK BY AND PEOPLE KIND ALIKE WOULD WHISPER LIKE OH LOOK AT HER GLOOTS AR

THREE THOUSAND GENES THE LAMON GENE IT'S NOT THE EXACT SAME TYPO BUT THEIRE ALMOST RIHTE NEXT TO EACH OTHER THAT'S SPLINTER OF DISTANCE AND TYPA LOCATION MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JILL'S MUSCLES AND PRISCILLA'S MUSCLES IT'S WHY JILL HAS EMERY DRYPUS AND PRISCILLA DOZN BUT DOCTOR GARG ALSO FOUND THAT THEY DO SHARE DISEASE THEY BOTH HAVE THE EXACT SAME RARE SUB TYPE OF LYPODISTROPHY THE

LEVELS LED TO A DRUG THAT TREATS HIGH COLLESTERAL IU KNALL ZIMER'S TREATMENT MIGHT COME FROM STUDYING A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE IN ICELAND THEY HAVE A SUPER RARE MUTATION THAT PROTECTS THEIR BRAINS RECENTLY A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS STARTED SOMETHING CALLED THE MATCH MAKER EXCHANGE IT'S A KIND OF OKE CUPID FOR RARE DISEASES WHERE PEOPLE CAN SHARE GENETIC AND SYMPTOM IN FORMATION WITH EACH OTHER AND DOCTORS THE HOPE IS THAT IT WILL SPARK NEW DISCOVERIES IT'S JUST THE THE WEEP OF GESAT OF MAKA SINGS BOSYBOR THAT'S ETIAN LEFE A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST IN FRANCE HE DOES SUPERTECHNICAL WORK ON A PROTINE WITH THE LOVELY NAME ESARI B P ONE IT AFFECTS FAT STORAGE AND HIS RESEARCH TEAM SHOWED THAT MESSING AROUND WITH IT CAN CREATE MICE WITH ALMOST NO MUSCLE AT ALL OR POTENTIALLY LITTLE RODEN

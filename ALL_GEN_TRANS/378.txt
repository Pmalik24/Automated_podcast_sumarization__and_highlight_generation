TO DISCUSS RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT WILL OFTEN FOCUSS ON ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT ALSO RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FRIENDS BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS AND INEVITABLY THE RELATIONSHIP TO SEL WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY FOCASED ON IN EPISODE ONE AND TO OF THIS SERIES EPISODE ONE BEING A ALL THE THINGS THAT GO IN TO A HEALTHY SELF AND HOW TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS UNHEALTHY AND HEALTHY IN ALL OF US AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNHEALTHY ASPECTS OF OUR UNCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUS THROUGH REALLY SPECIFIC PROACTIVE BEHAVIOURS AND PATTERNS OF THOUGHT SO REALLY A ROAD MAP TO THESE IDEALS THAT WE CALL MENTAL HEALTH AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE SELF TO DAY WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OF COURSE HOW PEOPLE RELATE BUT I HAVE A FEELING IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH OR PERHAPS ALMOST EVERYTHING TO DO WITH A RELATI NSHIP TO UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES OR FIRST YESSO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT PEOPLE HAVE SEEN EPISODES ONE IND TWO AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO HAVE SEEN WERE LISTEN TO EPISODES ONE IND TWO OF THE SERIES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND TODAY'S DISCUSSION COULD YOU PLEASE TELL US WHAT IS A HEALTHY PERSON AND HOW CAN WE ASK OURSELVES THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT ALLOW US TO DETERMINED WHETHER NOT WE ARE HEALTHY AND WHERE TO LOOK IN TERMS OF MAKING ADJUSTMENTS IF WE WANT TO BE HEALTHIER THAN WE ALREADY ARE WHICH I HAVE TO BELIEVE ALMOST EVERYBODY IF NOT EVERYBODY CERTAINLY WANTS TO BE THE HEALTHIEST AND BEST EXPRESSION OF THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY CAN DO THE MOST FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR OTHERS IN THE WORLD SO THE THE LYNCH PIN OF IT ALL IT IS THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS VERBS THAT'S THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THERE'S A LOT OF CLIMBING WE DO TO GET TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN ONCE ORE OVER THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THEN THINGS ARE IN A BETTER PLACE AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TWO WORDS A AGENCY IS OF COURSE A WORD GRATITUDE IS A WORD BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEIRE SEPARATE CONCEPTS APPROACHING THE WORLD THROUGH THE LENDS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THOUGHT OF AS ONE THING BECAUSE THEY COME TOGETHER AND THEY COME TOGETHER AS VERBS ITHAT'S WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING THAT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT COMES UNDERNEATH OF THAT IT TAKES US BACK TO THE THE TWO PILLARS AND THE THE TEN CUPBERDS AND IF WE'RE LOOKING IN THERE ENOUGH WER WE'RE MINDING WHAT IS IN MY UNCONSCIOUS MIND I MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF WLET ME GENERATE SOME CURIOSITY ABOUT MY DEFENCE MECHANISMS AND MY CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND THINK ABOUT WHAT SAILIENT INSIDE OF ME IF WE'RE DOING ALL OF THAT THEND WHAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING WERE BUILDING EMPOWERMENT WEREBUILDING HUMILITY AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE EXPRESSION OF ALL OF THT IS THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF LIKE AS IT WHAT'S THE BEST AMOUNT OF THAT THE MOST THAT'S POSSIBLE I BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE IN THE WORLD IN THE HEALTHIEST WAY BECAUSE AGENCY AND GRATITUE DOES IT MEAN  WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT EVERYTHING RIGHT IF THERE'S SOMETHING NEGATIVE AND WE CAN CHANGE THAT THEN WE DON'T FEEL HAPPY ABOUT THAT WE WE THA SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN ME MAKES ME MORE LIKELY TO FEEL THAT I CAN CHANGE THAT RIGHT OR TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF TRYING TO CHANGE THAT AND THEN THE AGENCY PART OF THAT CONCEPT CAN COME MORE TO THE FOREAGND I CAN MAKE THE CHANGE SO IT'S NOT ABOUT BLISS RIGHT IT'S NOT ABOUT FOR GIVINGSELF AND OTHERS FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND NOT WORKING TO MAKE BETTER IT'S ABOUT BEING IN THE WORLD AND BEING AS AWARE AS I CAN POSSIBLY BE INCLUDING BEING AWARE THAT THERE ARE THINGS I'M NOT AWARE OF RIGHT SOS O TO HAVING A HEALTHY RESPECT AND AN ORIENTATION TO THE WORLD THAT VALUES TRUTH AND VALUES UNDERSTANDING AND EXPLORATION IF WE DO ALL OF THAT THAN WE REACH THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THROUGH THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND THEN WHAT BUILDS UPON THAT OR WHAT COMES FROM THAT IS THE THE PEACE THE CONTENTMENT THE DELIGHT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE BEING STRENGTHEN LIKE THAT ALL COMES TOGETHER AND THEN THE AGGRESSIVE OR WE SAY AGGRESSIVE CAUSE THAT'S A TRADITIONAL TERM THE AGGRESSIVE WER THE ASSERTIVE RIGHT THE ASSERTIVENESS OR SSERTION DRIVE HOWEVER WHAT WHATEVER WERE WE ANT A PUT TO THAT THAT DRIVE EXISTS IN US IN A WAY THAT SUBSERVES THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THE SAME THING WITH THE PLEASURE DRIVE IN US ITS EXISTS IN US BUT ITS UBSERVING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAN ALL THOSE GOOD THINGS COME TOGETHER AND THEY COME TOGETHER TO HELP US BE AS HEALTHY AS WE CAN AND TO STAY HEALTHY RIGHT INCLUDING WHEN TRIBULATION OR DIFFICULTIES COME OUR WAY SO THAT WE STAY AS BEST WE CAN IN THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS VERBS AND AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING THEORETICAL ABOUT THIS LIKE IT'S A WAY TO LIVE AND AND THERE 'RE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE SOME OF THEIR LIVES OR PARTS OF THEIR LIVES THROUGH THAT RIGHT AND WE CAN ASPIRE TO IT AND WE CAN WORK TOWARDS IT AND IF WE'RE THE BEST THAT WE CAN BE THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS THE BEST WE CAN BE I THING ABOUT IT YOU AND I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WE KNOW EACH OTHER WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER IF I CAN BRING MY BEST SELF TO YOU TO THINKING ABOUT YOU TO UNDERSTANDING YOU IF I CAN BRING THE AGENCY AND THE GRATITUDE THEN I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT BYT YOU IN I MENTALIZE THIS IDEA OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDT OF YOU LIKE I'M GOING TO BRING THE BEST OF ALL OF THAT AND THEN BECAUSE WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THERE'S ALSO IN US LIKE THERE'S O ME THERE'S A YOU THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN US THAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP THAT'S THE US AND I WILL ALSO BRING MY BEST SELF TO THAT THING THAT IS NO LONGER JUST ME OR JST YOU BUT THAT ISN'T US AND THAT APPLIES TO ALL RELATIONSHIPS YOU CAN APPLY THAT TO SEEKING HEALTH IN EVERY SINGLE RELATIONSHIP IN OUR LIVES WHAT YOU'RE SAYING REALLY SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PEOPLE TAKING A REAL LOOK AT THEMSELVES YOU KOW WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY AN INVENTORY OF SELF IN THE TYPICAL SENSE THAT WERE USED TO HEARING IT BUT RATHER THROUGH THIS LENS OR MAP OF THE SELF THAT WAS SPELLED OUT AND EPISODES ONT IN TO AND ACANFER THOSE THAT ARE JUST JOINING THE SERIES NOW O'M THE MAP AS WE'RE REFERRING TO IT IS A BALBLES A DOWN LODABLE PEDI F IN THE SHOWN OUT CAPTIONS PEOPLE WANT TO GET THAT IT'S COMPLETELY YOUR OCOST YU JUST GO THERE AN ACCESSET OR DISPUTED ON A SCREEN PRINTED OUT WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU LIKE YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TO DO THAT BECAUSE HERE AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CORPS ELEMENTS OF THAT MAP WHICH UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY ARRIVE EVENTUALLY AT SET OF VERB STATES IT WERE CALLING AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THOSE ARE NOT SEPARATE AS YOU POINTED OUT THEY WORK TOGETHER YOU DESCRIBED IS IT ON TOP OF THE GEYSER A AND I I REALLY LIKE THAT THS A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON BUT THEN IT ALL UPLIFTS TO SOMETHING RIGHT ING IF WE'RE DOING IT IN THE RIGHT WAY IN IN THE DILIGENT WAY THEN IT IS LIKE A GEYSER AND W HAT IT'S LIFTING UP ON TOP OF IT IS THE AGENCY IN GRATITUDE I LOVE YOU YOU PUT THOSE WORDS TO AND I THINK IT CAPTURES IT REALLY PROFOUNDLY WILL THE STUFF THET GUISERS UP PERHAPS DESERVES A BIT OF OUR ATTENTION M JUST FOR A FEW MOMENTS AM YOU DESCRIBED THESE TWO PILLARS THEY I DESCRIBED AS GUISERING UP ITO AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IN THE IN THE BEST CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THE BEST CIRCUMSTANCES WE WANT TO MIND OURSELVES AND EVERYBODY ARE ATTAINABLE BY LOOKING AT WHAT'S IN THOSE PILLARS A THOSE TWO PILLARS ARE THE STRUCTURE OF SELFS ARE REALLY UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF SELF SO THAT INCLUDES SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSCIOUS MIND DEFENSE MECHANISMS CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND SELF THAT WAS ALL REVIEWED AND DESCRIBED IN EPISODES ONE INTO AS WELL AS THE FUNCTIONS OF SELF WHICH MORE OF THE VERB STATES THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE STRUCTURE OF SELF SELF AWARENESS ING THE FIRST OF THOSE DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN ACTION AND HERE AM I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T TELL MYSELF AND EVERYBODY ELSE AGAIN THAT DEFENSE MECHANISMS ARE NOT ALWAYS BAD THERE CAN BE HEALTHY DEFENSE MY CISTHEY CAN PROTECT US IN VERY VALUABLE WAYS AND THEN THIS NOTION OF SALIENTS WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO YEN WHAT SORTS OF SCRIPTS ARE GOING ON IN OUR HEAD ABOUT OURSELVES AND OTHERS WHAT ARE WE PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW ARE WE INTERPRETING THOSE IN OUR HEAD AND TO OTHERS AND IN MOST IMPORTANTLY PERHAPS TO OURSELFES AND THEN OUR ACTUAL BEHAVIORS UT WHAT ARE WE DOING FROM THE TIME WE WAKE UP UNTIL THE TIME WE GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND THEN OUR STRIVINGS OUR SENSE OF HOPEFULNESS OR PERHAPS LACK OF STRIVINGS AND THERE I REMINDED ALSO THAT NOBODY DOES ALL OF THESE THINGS PERFECTLY ALL THE TIME WE ALL HAVE ELEMENTS WITHIN US THAT PERHAPS ARE NOT SERVING TO GUYSER UP INTO AGENCY AN GRATITUDE AS WELL AS THEY COULD BUT THAT ALL OF US HAVE THE CAPACITY TO LOOK AT THESE TWO PILLARS AND THESE A TEN THINGS THAT WERE JUST LISTED OFF AS YOU DESCRIBE THEM AS CUPBOARDS THAT WE LOOK INTO AND EXAMINE AND THINK ABOUT AND THAT IF WE CAN DO THAT WITH A SKILLED CLINITION LIKE YOURSELF OR ANOTHER PSYCHATEROUS OR PSYCHOLOGIST TERRIFIC BUT EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT THAT WE CAN EXAMINE WITHIN US WHAT IS AND IS NOT SERVING TO GUYSOR UP INTO AGENCY AN GRATITUDE WE CAN BRING ANY ISSUE OF SELF TO THOSE TWO PILLARS AND THE TEN CUPBORDS WITHIN THEM ANY ISSUE OFSELF WHY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS RIGHT IN THE SENSE THATIC IT IS IS T US WHAT'S INSIDE OF ME I HAVE AN UNCONSCIOUS MIND I HAVE A CONSCIOUS MIND I HAVE A DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE I HAVE A CHARACTER STRUCTURE I HAVE A SELF   THAT'S WHAT IT IS RIGHT IN ALL THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU MENTION THEY'RE ALL GOING ON WITHIN THAT STRUCTURE OF SELF THEY'RE MANIFESTING THEMSELVES LIKE THAT'S WHAT IT IS WHEN WE'RE BEING RIGHT IN THE ACTIVE WAY OF THE VERB BEING THAT'S WHAT IT IS WHICH IS WHY WE CAN BRING TO IT ANY ISSUE OF SELF EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPLEXITY THERE YOU KNOW THE MILLION THINGS THAT GO ON IN A SECOND YONDERNEATH THE SURFACE IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND OURE DEFENSIVE STRUCTURES AND HAD TO SEE THEM BUTWE'RE HUMAN BEINGS WE'RE COMPLICATED RIGHT LIKE THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WE HAVE METHODS OF UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE METHODS OF INQUIRY AND WE CAN USE THOSE METHODS TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND THAT'S HOW WE MAKE THE GUYSER AS STRONG AS IT CAN BE WHERELIKE MAYBE SOME MAYBE SOME SOME OF THE WATERS RUNNING COUNTERCURRENT IN IN THE OKE WEL LET'S TRY AND HAVE THINGS GO ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT WE DON'T NEED THINGS TO BE PERFECT FOR FOR THE GUYS ARE TO SPRING UP AND THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE TO THEN BE UPLIFTED UPON IT SO EVERYBODY HAS ONE OF THESE MAPS AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND THEREFORE ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS ARE OTHERWISE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INTERSECTION OR OVERLAP OF THOSE MAPS IN SOME WAY MAYBE EVEN THE CENERGY AND THE OUT ORTH OF THOSE MAPS BECOMES ITS OWN MAP I THINK WE'LL GET TO THE SINLE OM IT LATER YES WHEN I AND MOST PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD RELATIONSHIPS AND PRETTY LER ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS I MAKE A COUPLE OF AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTIONS A FIRST OF ALL AFTER ASSUME THAT PEOPLE ARE EITHER IN A RELATIONSHIP OR OUT OF A RELATIONSHIP THERE'S PROBABLY A THIRD CATEGORY OUT THERE OF PLURELS AND OTHER THINGS BUT WILL KEEP IT RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND MOST PEOPLE I ASSUME WHEN THEY SEARCH FOR OR ENTER OR ENTERED A RELATIONSHIP THEY THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD A RESONANCE WITH THE PERSON WHETHER NOT YOU KNOW THERE WAS TA INTELLECTUAL OR MUTUAL INTEREST RESONANCE ORE A PHYSICAL RESONANCE A YOU KNOW MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT FAMILY HISTORY COMMON GOALS ET CETERA A THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT AND THEN A PERHAPS IF PEOPLE HAVE A BIT MORE OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OR THEIR A READING SOME INAPOPPSYCHOLOGY BOOKS THESE DAYS YOU KNOW SOME OF WHICH ARE ARE  PRETTY GOOD A THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT THEMSELVES ARE THE OTHER PERSON BEING A BIT MORE ANXIOUS OR A BIT MORE RELAXE SO YOU'LL HEAR THINGS LIKE ANXIOUS ATTACHED SECURE ATTACHE THINGS THAT OF THAT SORT IF WE COULD JUST STEP BACK FROM ALL OF THAT FOR A MOMENT AND EXAMINE IT THROUGH THE LENDS OF THE MAPS AS YOURE DESCRIBING THEM WHICH EXIST IN ALL OF US AND THAT REALLY ARE THE MAP TO BEING THE BEST VERSION OF OURSELVES IF WE LOOK AT RELATIONSHIPS IN TERMS OF LISTS OF YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE PEOPLE WENT TO SCHOOL IF THEY WENT TO SCHOOL OF THE OARE TE PARENTS MARRI OR DIVORCE YOU KNOW DO THEY HAVE TROMA THAT THEYRE WEREOF OR NOT AWARE OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS I GUESS WE COULD CALL THOSE AND HERE I AM BORROWING LANGUAGE THAT YOU USED EARLIER OFF CAMERA SO I WANT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A YOU POINTS OF COMPATIBILITY LIKE LIKE I THINK THAT SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START I DO PEOPLE WANT THE SAME THING SO IF YOU IF YOU COULD I COULD YOU TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT POINTS OF CO PATIBILITY IN RELATIONSHIP AND HOW THOSE SHOW UP UM FOR BETTER FOR WORSE WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER PEOPLE IN THE CLINICAL SEITING YET WHEN YOU SEE A RELE SOMEBODY WHOS IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S REALLY WORKING FOR THEM AND ITS HEALTHY VERSES IF THEREIN RELATIONSHIP WORTS REALLY UNHEALTHY UM PRESUMELY THERE'S SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT POINTS OF COMPATIBILITY BUT I'M GUESSING THAT'S NOT ALWAYS INTO ITIVE II THINK THE PLACE WE START THERE IT IS ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT WE CAN KNOW AND WHAT WE CAN'T KNOW SO THIS IDEA THAT THEREARE LEVELS OF EMERGINGS WHERE WERE THINGS THAT A E LOWER LEVEL COME TOGETHER AND CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S KNEW WE SEE THIS THROUGHOUT SCIENCE FROM SOMEATOMIC PARTICLES ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO CULTURE I SO SOME ONE COULD KNOW THEORETICALLY LE LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS ABOUT YOU AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS ABOUT ME BUT THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT US RIGHT KTHEY DO'T KNOW HOW WE INTERACT THEY DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE SHARED INTEREST WHAT WE TALK ABOUT RIT THEY THEY DON'T KNOW THAT NO ONE KNOWS THAT LIKE WE DON'T KNOW THAT ABOUT THE COMBINATION OF PEOPLE WE CAN'T KNOW IT IN ADVANCE BUT WE WE OFTEN BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WHICH THEN LEADS TO A LOT OF FALSE METRICS OF TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR COMPATIBILITY THE THOUGHT WE'S VERY BASIC TANGIBLE THINGS LIKE ROOM AN ROMANCE FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE'S SOMEONE WHO ABSOLUTELY WANTS HAV A FAMILY AND THERE'S SOME ONE WHO ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT WANTO HAVE A FAMILY LOK THAT WOULD BE A REASON FOR THOSE TWO PEOPLE TO NOT CHOOSE ONE ANOTHER RIGHT SO THERE ARE THERE ARE THESE FACTORS BUT BUT THE FACTORS ORE ALL NESENTS VERY EVIDENT AND VERY CONCRETE HT IF WE GO IF WE GO BEYOND THAT WE SO CAN WE CAN SEE THE OBVIOUS IGHT THEN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS REALLY A COMPATIBILITY OF GENERATIVE DRIVES I AND THEN THAT IT TELLS YOU CAN THESE PEOPLE THEN GET ALONG LOOKING KNOW MAYBE ONE OF THEM IS FROM ONE SIDE OF THE WORLD AND TE OTHERS FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD OR ONCE IN A COUNT AND THAN THE OTHER IS I MUSICIAN AND YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT OUTLI THEY'RE BUILT NOT TO GET ALONG OR THAT IF THEY'RE DOING THE SAME THING THE'RE BUILT TWO GET ALONG OR IF THERE THEY WENT TO COLLEGE IN THE SAME PLACE WHEN HE WENT TO COLLEGE R VERSE IS NOT GOING TO COLLEGE BAT THERE'S SO MUCH THERE THAT WE WE TRY TO BUILD A STORY ON AND THEN WHAT WE DO AS WE MISS THE FOREST FOR THE TREES RIGHT AND THE TREES I THINK ARE THE FACTORS THAT DON'T MATTER SO GET LET'S THINK ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT DO MATTER PRES ONCE HAVE A FAMILY OF THE PERSON DOESN'T THAT'S RELEVANT BUT THE THE TREES THAT MISLEAD US MIGHT BE DID THEYVE THE SAME LEVEL OF EDUCATION A DID THEY HAVE THE SAME FAMILY STRUCTURE GROWING UP ARE PARENTS STILL TOGETHER A WHAT DO THEY ENJOYER THEY CREATIVE OR SCIENTIFIC OR WHATEVER CREATIVELY SCIENTIFIC WAY WE WE COULD LOOK AT ALL THAT BUT I THINK THEN WWE'RE MAKING A BUNCH OF TREES THAT MISLEAD US IF YOU SAY  TO THESE PEOPLE COME AT THE WORLD THROUGH HOW MUCH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IS THERE GUIDING THEM HAT YOU KNOW HOW HIGH IS THE TOP OF THAT GUISER HOW HIGH AS IT UPLIFTING THAT HOW STRONG IS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IF WE MATCH PEOPLE UPON THAT THEN WE SEE OH THOSE PEOPLE GOT ALONG AND THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T AND THEN THE OTHER ALL THE OTHER FACTORS LIKE FEREMONS RIGHT IN THINGS THAT WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND OR LIKE REFLECTIVE FIRST IMPRESSION SO SO WE COULD LET THINGS DEVELOP HONORING THE TRUTH OF WHAT WE CAN'T KNOW THAT WHEN YOU PUT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER YOU GET SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFERENT THEN THE SUM OF BOTH PEOPLE RIGHT IT'S NOT AN OVERLAP OF MAPS RIGHT IT'S A NEW MAP RIGHT AND THE MAP IS INFORMED BY THINGS THAT AR THAT ARE ON EACH INDIVIDUALS MAP BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ARE MAPS THAT DON'T HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT A AM DIFFERENCES AROUND JUST CLEAR CONCRETE THINGS RIGHT BUT ONCE WE GET BEYOND THAT THE MAPS CAN SENERGIZE IN ALL SORTS OF BEAUTIFUL AND UNPREDICTABLE WAYS IT AND IF BOTH ARE ARE COMING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A GENERATIVE DR IVE THAT IS AT THE FOREFRONT GREAT YOU PUT THOSE MAPS TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS MAYBE NOTHING HAPPENS O CAY THOSE PEOPLE DON'T GO OUT ON A SECOND DATE YOU NEY MAY BE SOMETHING HAPPENS BUT IT DOESN'T DEVELOP IN CERTAIN WAYS LOOK ARE THOSE PEOPLE DATED THAN STOPDATING LIKE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME I BUT WE SET THE ODDS IN OUR FAVOR THAT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IN EACH THAT IS AT THE FOREFRONT MEANS THAT THEIR MAPS CAN SINERGIZE IN WAYS THAT CAN THEN BE BEAUTIFUL AND WAYS THAT CAN MAY BE BRING TO BOTH PEOPLE THAT WHICH WHICH THEY WANT AND I THINK THERE'S A SIMPLICITY TO THAT THAT I THINK IF WE HONOR IT CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL WHETHER ITS ROMANCE IS FRIENDSHIPS OF LOOKING AT WHAT THE TRUTH OF IT IS INSTEAD OF THE FACTORS THAT WE TRY IND GAIN A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY IF WERE WERE USING THEM TO SELECT UPON YOU MENTION SEVERAL TIMES THE GENERATIVE DRIVE NI DEFULLY WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT AND SPEND SOME TIME THERE IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIPS BUT JUST TO DRILL A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO WHAT WE'VE ALL HEARD SO OFTEN AND YOU TOUCH UPON A FEW OF THESE SEEMS A AROUND POINTS OF COMPATIBILITY BUT ALSO WEARE A SOMETIMES WE CAN A RESPOND TO THE WRONG THINGS WHEN THINKING ABOUT COMPATIBILITY AGAIN REFRAMING THIS MAINLY IN THE CONTEXT OF HYPOTHETICAL ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT CERTAINLY IT PRETAINS TO OTHER SORTS OF RELATIONSHIPS THINGS LIKE A YOU KNOW IS ONE PERSON EDUCATED A WITHIN ADVANCE TEGREE IN IS AND IS THE OTHER PERSON ALSO YOU KNOW WE TEND TO ASSUME THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE A ARE SOMEHOW A BETTER MATCH THAN PEOPLE WHO AREN'T  THE SORT OF IT IMPLICIT ASSUMPTION THAT'S OFTEN MADE NOT ALWAYS OR THAT A YOU KNOW IF TWO PEOPLE REALLY LOVE MUSIC THAT THEY WILL ENJOY MUSIC TOGETHER AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE HOLE IS GREATER THAN EITHER OF ITS PARTS YOU KNOW AND THEN AND I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE UTTERLY IRRELEVANT INTERESTING AND I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT M IF YOU THINK ABOUT A WHICH I'M SURE YOU DON'T BUT LIKE DATING APS FOR INSTANCE IKE WHAT'S LISTED OUT THERE OR AM FIRST OR SECOND DATES WHICH YOU KNOW CONSIST OF LIKE LEARNING A LITT OF IT ABOUT SOMEBODY IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND MAYBE VEN  A BIT ABOUT THEIR HISTORY AND AND AM MAY BE AN ACTIVITY A AND CERTAINLY AN ATTENTIONAL WARENESS TO HOW THE OTHER PERSON IS BEHAVING IN THE CONTECTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW A WAITER OR WAITERES AND HOW THEYR TREATING PEOPLE AND AND YOU AND AND THEN YOU HEARE ABOUT THINGS LIKE AM WHAT ARE THE A THIS IS NOT SONY IN FROM OH RIGHT THE UM THE LOVE LANGUAGES PEOPLE LIKE AT WHAT'S THEIR LOVE LANGUAGES YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE GIFTS WHO ARE LIKE A ACTS OF PHYSICAL AM A TAUCH OR YOU KNOW OR ACTS OF SERVICE OR SOMETHING I MET SOME ONE RECENTLY AND SHE TOLD ME A MY LOVE LANGUAGE IS ALL OF THEM YOU KNOW WHICH I THING IS THE MOST HONEST ANSWER RIGHT E IS SURE THERE'S PROBABLY SOME WAITING AROUND WHAT PEOPLE VALUE MORE OR LESS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THE THINGS THEY VALUE THE MOST I IT WOULD PROUBABLY FEEL BIT LIKE DEPRIVATION AM IN ANY RELATIONSHIP BUT AS I'M DESCRIBING ALL THIS IN REALIZING MORE AND MORE YES ALL OF THAT MATTERS ANXIOUS TO TACH SECURE ATTACH LOVE LANGUAGE IS ET CETERA BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER A IT REALLY DOESN'T GET TO THIS AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING THIS GENERATIVE DRIVE IN INDIVIDUALS AND WHETHER NOT THOSE MATCH UP WELL ALONG THE POINTS OF COMPATIBILITY WET HE OTHER PERSONS GENERATIVE TRIVE AND YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T RUN A A CONTROLLED STUDY FOR THIS BUT THE BEST EVIDENCE I HAVE IS THAT THERY'RE FORTUNATELY ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE IN HAPPY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS BUT THER'RE MANY MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT EITHER BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND THEM OR THEY'RE IN THEM AND THEY'RE NOT HEALTHY WERE THEY'RE NOT HAPPY ET CETERA SO IF YOU COULD UM ELABORATE A BIT MORE ON THE GENERATIVE DRIVE GAN REMINDING US WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT IS WE COVER THE SABIT AN EPISODES WANTED TO BUT WHAT WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT IS AND AND SOME DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THAT'S EXPRESSED AND HOW THAT A SHOWS UP IN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP YE I THINK WE REALLY DISAPPROVE THE IDEA THAT THAT SOME OF THESE THESE FACTORS I THINK ARE SUPERFICIAL IN THE CONTECT OF WHETHER PEOPLE ARE OING TO BE COMPATIBLE DOE NOT SUPERFICIAL THINGS BUT THEY'RE NOT GERMAIN RIGHT STHE SAY Y YOU THINK ABOUT MUSIC RIAN THAY TWO PEOPLE ARE CONTEMPLATING ROMANCE RIGHT AND THEY BOTH REALLY LIKE MUSIC WELL THAT COULD GO VERY VERY WELL LETS SAY THEY BOTH HAVE ASTRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT E THAT THOSE PILLARS ARE PRETTY HEALTHY AND THE GUYSAR OF THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IS WRITING UPON IT AND THEY CAN FIND PIECE IN THEM IN THEMSELVES I'M THEY'RE STRONGLY GENERATIVE THEN THEY COULD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE MUSIC THE OTHER PERSON LIKES ISN'T THERES IKING TO BE A COMPLETE OVERLAP RIGHT EVEN IF PEOPLE GENERALLY LIKE THE SAME THING BUT THE SAY THEY LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS IK JUST LIKING MUSIC OR EVEN LIKING THE SAME MUSIC THE'RE'S STILL DIFFERENCE RIGHT SO THE PERSON HAS TO GO BEYOND THEMSELVES RIGHT AND SAY OOK  I'M INTERESTED AND LIKE WHAT YOU THINK EVEN ABOUT THE MUSIC WE BOTH LIKE RIGHT WHAT FACTORS DO YOU LIKT THE'RE PLACE IS OF OF LEARNING AND OF GROWTH FOR BOTH AND YOU COULD SEE HOW BOTH LIKING MUSIC WHETHER IT'S THE SAME OR DIFFERENT MUSIC THAT SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT WE COULD ALSO SEE HOW THAT CAN NOT BE GREAT RIHT IF IF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS TOO LOW AND THE AGGRESSION DRIVE IS TOO HIGH RIHT THEN I'M GOING TO THINK I LIKE MUSIC MY MUSIC BETTER THAN YOURS ORYOU KDONT WRIGT OR YOU DON PEPEOPLE THEN START THEY THO THOU FRAGMENT T RIGHT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE SAME INTEREST OR IF THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS TOO HIGH THEN THEY THINK I WON LISTEN TO MY MUSIC NOT YOURS I II'M FAMILIAR WITH IT INSTEAD OF AY I'M INTERESTED IN THAT MUSIC BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IT AND I'M INTERESTED IN YOU RIGHT WHICH LEADS US TO THE SECOND PARLOT SAY OF SOME ONE WHO REALLY HAS NO INTEREST IN MUSIC AND SOME ONE WHO DOES WELL THE'RE CAN BE AN OPENNESS OF SAYING IF I'M INTERESTED IN THIS PERSON AND THIS PERSON IS REALLY INTERESTED IN MUSIC LIC WELL THAT I HAVE SOME INTEREST IN IT RIGHT A ONE O LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT I WONT EXPERIENCE SOME OF IT WITH THE OTHER PERSON AND AND LET SAY THAT PERSON AND FIND SAY THAT'S NOT MY THING IS NOT THE THING WE CONNECT ON THEN WHY WOULD THAT BE THE END OF THE WORLD LIKE WEN ATE PEOPLE ONE PRESON GOES TO CONCERT THE OTHER DOESN'T RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE WE WE TRY AND FIND THESE POINTS OF COMMONALITY BECAUSE I THINK WE GET OVER REDUCTIONISTS AND THEN WE THINK OH HEE'S ONTS OF FACTORS THAT WE WILL IDENTIFY AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY OBSCURE US FROM THE PRIMARY FACTOR WHICH IS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WHICH OF COURSE WILL THEN INDUCE OPEN MINDEDNESS MENTALIZATION IF I DON'T LIKE MUSIC AND YOU DO INSTEAD OF SAYING WHAS HE LIKE MUSIC FOR YOU KNOW I NEED OF FRIENDSHIP WITH SOMEBODY LIKES MUSIC YOU KNOW YOU THINK HE LIKE THAT'S INTERESTING LIKE IF I'M INTERESTED IN YOU AS A FRIEND AND I'VE RESPECT FOR YOU IN WHAT YOU THINK THEN WHY WOULD I NOT HAVE SOME INTEREST IN WHAT YOU'ARE INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW SO SOLUTIS IDEA OF COMPATIBILITY REVOLVES AROUND THE HEALTH IN EACH PERSON IT DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND FACTORS THAT ARE ANYTHING BUT THTHE CONCRETE LOGISTICAL FACTORS THAT WOULD JUST KEEP TWO PEOPLE APART I LOVE THE IDEA THAT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS CENTER ROUND THE FACTORS THAT REALLY MATTER WITHIN THE SELF ND IN PARTICULAR THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND I AND I LOVE THE EXAMPLE OF I'M SOME ONE BEING ABLE TO BE CURIOUS ABOUT SOMEBODYEASE INTERESTS ABOUT THEIR PARTNERS INTERESTS EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT NOT SHARE THOSE AM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE BECAUSE THE AGENCY COMPONENT THERE IS REALLY KEY I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL AS IF THEY AREN'T REALLY GOOD IT SOMETHING ARE REALLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT SOMETHING THEN IT'S NOT FOR THEM RIGHT WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF HAVING AGENCY AND GRATITUDE BECAUSE GRATITUDE IS CLOSELY TIED TO HUMILITY THEYOM HOW COULD WE KNOW EVERYTHING I CAN BECUT  CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT OTHERS SO THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT INCLUDES A ASPECTS OF OPENNESS OF HUMILITY BUT ALSO THE AGENCY CIETY EMPOWERMENT LIKE OF I'M TO LEARN MORE THAN PRO PS YOU KOW WE COULD ENJOY MORE OF THAT TOGETHER U PERHAPS NOT I I THINK A THIS IS WHAT I'M SENSING AND I'M ALSO SENSING THAT AM THE WORDS LIKE MINDIT YOU KNOW LIKE MINDED PEOPLE A HAS SO MUCH MORE TO DO WITH THEIR GENERATIVE DRIVES AND HOW THOSE MATCH UP I SUPPOSE TO THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY PREFER ENGAGING IN AND THE SORTS OF FOODS THEY LIKE OR THE MOVIES THEY LIKE AND A WHICH MAKE SENSE AT SOME LEVEL BUT I THINK IT IS STILL A COUNTER INTUITIVE FOR FOR A LOT OF US WHO UM JUST CONE O REFLECTIBELY THEY GO LIKE THEY LIKE THE SAME THINGS YOU KNOW OR MAYBE HT MAYBE VEN THEY MET AT WORK BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE SAME TYPE OF WORK AM THEY LIKE TO LIVE IN A CERTAIN AREA THE COUNTRY AND THEREFORE BY PROXIMITY THEY MET  AND THIS RAISES ALL SORTS OF A INTERESTING IDEAS PERHAPS ABOUT AM THE STATISTICS OF WHAT WE SEE RIGHT LIKE TWO MUSICIANS TOGETHER UM WE THEREFORE ASSUME THAT MUSICIANS A BELONG TOGETHER OR TWO SCIENTISTS TOGETHER I KNOW LOADS OF SCIENTIST SCIENTIST COUPLES OR SCIENTISTS PHYSICIAN COUPLES AND A BUT OF COURSE THE NUMBERS ARE SCEWED BECAUSE THEY WERE WORKING N ENVIRONMENTS WHERE IT INCREASE THE PROBABILITY THEY WOULD INTERACT SO THIS'S ACTUALLY A VOTE FOR ON LINDATING IND SOME SCENSE BECAUSE IT BREAKS THROUGH ALL THOSE AM SOMETIMES EVEN GEOGRAPHICAL BARRIERS BUT CERTAINLY THAT THE THE TRADITIONAL BARRIERS OF CULTURE RIGHT RIGHT IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT RELATIONSHIP SO I WOULD LIKE MY RELATIONSHIPS TO LAST AS LONG AS POSSIBLE RIGHT THAT MEANS NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY LIFESPAN AND MY HEALTHSPAN RIGHT LIKE THAT'S THEN BECOMES PART OF THAT DISCUSSION OF COURSE WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN LIFESPAN AND HEALTHSPAN AND WE SEE PEOPLE DO MUCH MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY'RE INTERCONNECTED IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM WHEN THEYRE'S STILL LEARNING NEW THINGS LIKE WHAT WE KNOW THAT'S TRUE THAT PEOPLE OFTEN WILL TAIL YOU LOSE SO O TRAIL OFF OFOF WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING WHETHER ITS ITS MUSIC ITS LITERATURE ITS THE WORLD AROUND US YOUNO RELATIVELY EARLY IN OUR LIFE SPAN BUT THE PERSON WHOSE INTERCONNECTED LEARNING NEW THINGS I H AS MUCH GREATER PROBABILITY OF LIVING LONGER AND LIVING HEALTHIER RIHT SO THINK WHAT'S THAT ABOUT IT'S ABOUT A GENERATIVE DRIVE RIGHT IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW IT I'VE LEARN A LOT OF THINGS OVER THE COURSE OF MY LIFE AND I'M EIGHTY YEARS OLD NOW AND LIKE GREAT THAT THERE'S MORE TO LEARN RIGHT AND LKETHAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IT MAKES ME THINK OF A WOMAN IS AROUND NINETY YEARS OLD IN AN MY PRACTICESHE'S ALWAYS LEARNING NEW THINGS LIKE SHE SUPERINTERESTED IN THINGS AND I'M ALWAYS STRUCK ABOUT HOW LE SHE SEEMS SO MUCH YOUNGER RIGHT AND AND THERE THAT'S NOT JUST A SELECTION BY US LIPLE I JUST HAPPEN TO SEE THAT IN THAT PERSON IKE SHE HAS THE FACTORS THAT RE DISPOSE TO AGING IN THE WAY THAT'S HEALTHIEST AND HAPPIEST SO IT REALLY COMES OWN THE ROOT OF ALL OF IT IN OURSELVES IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS IN THE QUALITY OF THEM OVER TIME AND HOW LONG WE GET TO HAVE THEM WE ARISES FROM A GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THAT'S THE THING THAT MAKES US THAN UN DEFENDED RIGHT AND LET'S US FIND INTEREST IN THINGS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE THINGS IN US WHICH ALSO COMES ABOUT NATURALLY LIKE I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE HAVE THE SORT OF BIAS LIKES THAT MUSICIANS BELONG TOGETHER WHY THE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE SAME THINGS RIGHT I GUESS THEY HAVE THE SAME INTEREST SAME THING WITH SCIENTISTS BUT THEN A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE DIFFERENT FOODS RIGHTLC I LOVE DIFFERENT ETHNIC FOODS  WHY CAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT RIGHT IT'S IT'S AN APPRECIATION OF DIFFERENCE I DON'T WANT TO EAT JUST LIKE I DID GROWING UP AND MANY MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT THAT'S AN APPRECIATION OF DIFFERENCE OF DIVERSITY SO SOMETIMES WILL KIND OF HARNESS THATIMAL LOOK AT ANIMALS SAY OH LIKE THAT'S PRESENT IN US BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON WE BECOME VERY REDUCTIONIST ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO MATCH BASED UPON SAMENESS RIGHT AND LIKE SAMENESS IS IS NOT THE POINT OF IT AN MEAN THERE EVEN THOUGHTS RIGHT ABOUT PEOPLE THAN IN SOME WAY SEEKING DIFFERENCE RIGHT AND MAY BE FAIREMONDS ARE TELLING AS ILIKE I IO KNO VERY LITTLE ABOUT THAT BUT I CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THE STRIVING FOR SAMENESS DOES IT MAKE GOOD THINGS HAPPEN IN RELATIONSHIP SEM I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND I DON'T SEE THAT THE ALLEGED FACTORS OF SAMENESS MATTER AGAIN UNLESS THEYRE'S SO CONCRETE LIKE IF THIS PERSON IS ABSOLUTELY CON TO LIVE IN NORTH AMERICA AND THAT PERSONS ABSOLUTLY CON T LIVE IN SOUTH AMERICA LET'S NOT PROTENTIALLY PUT THEM TOGETHER BUT ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM ALMOST THAT LEVEL OF CONCRETENESS LET'S LOOK FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THEN LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IT SIMPLIFIES T THE HIGHER WE GO UP THE LATTER THE MORE SIMPLE THINGS GET IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PILLAR'S STRUCTURE OF SO FUNCTION OF SELF YOU'RE CREATING THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THAND WOULD YOU LOOKING FOR YOU LOOKING FOR PARTNER IMATCH IN GENERATIVE DRIVE I WANT A MIT I WONT MIND TO BE STRONG AND I SEE THAT IT'S STRONG IN THIS PERSON THEY CREATE IN A WAY YOU KNOW I I DO SINS THEY GRO GARDEN REGENERATIVE TOGETHER RIGHT LIKE THAT COULD BE SUPERCOMPATIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ONE FACTOR THAT REALLY MATTERS ID LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS A G ONE AG ONE IS A VITAMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT MEETS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS I STARTED TAKING A G ONE WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AN TWELTH SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE A G ONE ONCE OR GENERALLY TWICE PER DAY IS THAT IT'S THE EASIEST WAY FOR ME TO INSURE THAT I'M GETTING ALL OF THE VITAMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBRE THAT I NEED IN MY DIET NOW OF COURSE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO GET PROPER NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS BUT MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FIND IT HARD TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS O FRUITS AND VEGETABLES EACH DAY AND ESPECIALLY TO GET ENOUGH PREBIOTICS AND PROBIOTICS TO INSURE GOT HEALTH AS YOU MAY KNOW YOURE GOT CONTAINS TRILIANS OF LITTLE MICROBIODA THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBYOM WHICH ESTABLISHES CRITICAL CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANS OF YOUR BODY TO ENHANCE BRAIN HEALTH AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER ASPECTS THAT RELATE TO MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET IS IF YOU WERE TO TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHICH SUPPLEMENT WOULD THAT BE IN MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS G ONE BECAUSE BY TAKING G ONE I'M ABLE TO ENSURE THAT I'M GETTING ALL OF THE VITAMENS MINERALS AND PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED TO ENHANCE MY MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY G ONE THEY'LL TO DRINK G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBORMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK G ONE DOT ALM SLASH HUBORMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER REALIZING THAT MOST OF WHAT I AND EVERYONE ELSE HAS HEARD ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS IS COMPLETE NONSENSE I REALLY MEAN THAT I MEAN IT HAS OCCUR TO BE BEFORE BECAUSE I'VE EXPERIENCED BOTH THAT THE PHRASES ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER AND OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND ARE IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION WITH ONE ANOTHER SO THEY'RE BOTH TRUE DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND YOU KNOW THEELKNOWSHY IT COULD RIGHT YOUALSO HEAR OPPOSITES ATTRACT BUT THEY DON'T STAY TOGETHER RIGHT YOU HEARE SIMILARITY ORE THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO FIND SO ONE SIMILAR TO YOU THAT THAT WERE THAT THEYRE'S LIKE ONE PERSON RIGHT THAT'S RIFE  I MEAN THESE ARE IF WE REALLY THINK ABOUT IT CRAZY RIGHT NOTIONS YES BUT THEY DRIVE A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLEDRUNKLOUTERLY ANXIOUS RIGHT THEY DRIVE ANX RIG THEY DRIVE BAD CHOICES THEY DRIVE A SITUATIONS AND THEN CREATE A SENSE OF GUILT AND SHAME AND INADEQUACY WE MISLEAD OURSELVES BY NOT GOING TO THE BASICS OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE LIE AN WE LOOK AT MYSELF MAKE MYSELF AS HEALTHY AS I CAN BE RIHTAUS IF I'M HEALTHY A'LL RECOGNIZE A LACK OF HEALTH IN THE OTHER RIGHTS IT ALSO PROTECTS US AAGAINST BAD RELATIONSHIPS AND IF ING AN T MAKE MYSELF HEALTHY WHICH WE'RE DESCRIBING HOW THAT LOOKS WOULDN'T I WANT SOME ONE WHO ALSO ONCE TO MAKE THEMSELVES HEALTHIER AT LEAST IF WE'RE GAN A LIE  LET'S LET'S A LIE AROUND MAKING BOTH OF OF OURSELVES HEALTHIER ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE GOING TO GO DEEPER INTO HOW TO  LOOK INTO THE MAP OF SELF AND HOW THAT RELATES TO RELATIONSHIP A RANLY A MORE AS WE GO ALONG THE A DISCUSSION YOU'VE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES HOWEVER ABOUT GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THAT IT REALLY IS THE DEFINITION OF LIKE MINDED IN SOME SENSE AND YOU ALSO MENTIONED AGGRESSIVE DRIVES AND PLEASURE DRIVES THEMES THAT WE TOUCHED ON AGAIN AND EPISODES ANTED TO BUT LISTENING TO THOSE EPISODES IS CERTAINLY NOT NECESSARY TO DIGEST WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY COULD YOU GO A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE GENERATIVE DRIVE FLUSH OUT FOR US WHAT THAT IS A I THINK GENERATIVE I THINK GENERATOR I THINK ENERGY A I HEAR AGGRESSION OR AGGRESSIVE DRIVE I THINK AS I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO A FRICTION MAY BE EVEN CONFLICT MAYBE PHYSICAL CONFLICT MAY BE VERBAL CONFLICT BUT I KNOW IT'S SOME OF THAT PERHAPS BUT A WHOLE LOT MORE AND THEN PLEASURE DRIVE AND PLEASURE A SOME PEOPLE THINK BLISS SOME PEOPLE THINK A DELIGHT A SOME PEOPLE A PROBLY HAVE ALL SORTS OF SPECIFIC THINGS THEY THINK OF WITH RESPECT TO PLEASURE SO YOU JUST FLUSH THOSE OUT FOR U LITLA BIT MORE CAUSE IT I THINK THOSE ARE GOING TO SERVE AS A CORNERSTONES OF TO DAYS ADISCUSSION SURE THE DRIVES IN IN THIS CASE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE TAT OF EXIST WITHIN US AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEIRE DEFINING POTENTIAL I SO SO RIGHT NOW ONE COULD ARGUE IF WE JUST PAUSE FOR A COUPLE SECONDS WERE NOT DOING ANYTHING GENERATIVE IN THOSE SECONDS I BUT THEN WE RESUME DOING SOMETHING THAT WE BELIEVE IS GENERATIVE I SO  THTHE TIME WERE PAUSING THAT SOME WE CUSEI TO LOOK AT THAT AS AS A DRIVE WITHIN US TO TO TO MAKE NEW LEARNING I TO UNDERSTAND THINGS WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BEFORE TO SPREAD A SENSE OF GOODNESS I SO IT RESIDES IN US IN A WAY THAT IS DETERMINED BY A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT FACTORS LIKE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THATS DETERMINED WITHIN US THERE'S A NATURE AND A NERTURE COMPONET SO SOME ASPECT OF IT OR WHAT ARE THE GENETICS THAT CAME DOWN TO US WHAT A FORMITIVE EXPERIENCES BUT WE CAN GO IN AND ALTAR THAT SO IF WE SEE THE DRIVE AS A SET OF POTENTIALS LIKE IN THAT MOMENT WE PAUSE THERE'S A SET OF POTENTIALS WITHIN US LIKE POTENTIAL OF WHERE WE CAN TAKE OUR THOUGHTS OUR ACTIONS ARE REFLECTIONS ARE DECISIONS THAT'S THE DRIVE WITHIN US AND IT EXISTS WITHIN US IN A WAY THAT WE COULD LOCALIZE NOW IF WE THINK ENOUGH ABOUT  GET HOW MUCH OF A GENERATIVE DRIVE IS THEIR IN A PERSON HOW MUCH IS THAT PERSON LOOKING TO THE TO TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES OR BETTER WORLD AROUND THEM AND HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT THEMSELVES NERBILITY TO DO THAT HOW GENERATIVE ARE THEY OR HOW SHUT DOWN OR DEMORALIZED OR ENVIOUS SO WE CAN IN A SENSE LOCALIZE THAT AND AGAIN THE LOCALIZATION AS THESE GENETIC AND NURTURE COMPONENTS TO IT BUT WE CAN THEN GO AND INFLUENCE THAT AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE IMPORTANCE IF THE DRIVE I'S A SET OF POTENTIALS A SET OF POSSIBILITIES THAN THAT DRIVE IS ONE IND THE SAME PERVADED WITH HOWEVER WE WANT A TO TO TO DESCRIVE THAT WITH THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE CAUSE THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IS SOT OF THE OPERATIVE FORMER THAT THAT'S THE VERB RIGHT IT'S THE DRIVE ACTUALLY DRIVING SOMETHING RIGHT SO FEEL A STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE THAND AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ARE LEADING THE DECISIONS THE REFLECTIONS ARE COMING THROUGH THAT THE AGGRESSION WITHIN US OR AGAIN THAT'S THE THE THIS THE HISTORICAL WORD AS WE SAY AGGRESSION ASSERTION PROACTE PROACTIVENESS RIGHT ALL OF THIS INSIDE OF US AND OURE DRIVE FOR PLEASURE FOR GRATIFICATION THAT ALL IS THEN IS IN US BUT ITS SUBSERVING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE MEANING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT SET OF POTENTIALS AND POSSIBILITIES IS DOMINANT WHICH OF COURSE MAKE SENSE WITH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THOSE ACTIVE VERBS BEING WHAT IS MOST ACTIVE RIGHT AN THEN WE'RE ALSO GIN TO FEEL AT TIMES AN HOPEFULLY AT A LOT OF TIMES HETHAT SET OF PEACEFULNESS THAT SAID'S OF CONTENTMENT THE SENSE OF DELIGHT RAND WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHEN YOU'R YOU OF DOING THE POTCASTING YOUR IN IT ALL THESE GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO YOU WRITE THERE'S A STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE IN YOU THAT SET OF POTENTIALS ARE BEING ACTUALIZED THROUGH THE VERBS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE LIKE YOU'RE DOING IT ALL RIGHT THEN AND AS YOU'RE DOING IT YOU HAVE A SENSE OF PEACE AND CONTENTMENT AS YOU'RE ENACTING ALL OF IT AND THEN THAT MAKES YOU HEALTHIER REENFORCES THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IT PROTECTS YOU AGAINST THE NEXT SLING OR ARROW OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE THAT WILL COME YOUR WAY RHT YOU BECOME MORE SELF KNOWLEDGEABLE MORE OU BECOME STRONGER T AND AND ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT WERE LOOKING FLIKE THAT'S THE STATE OF GOODNESS AND I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE SEEKING WE CAN PUT SO MANY WORDS TO IT AND WERE IT WERE CHOOSING TO PUT THESE WORDS TO IT MAND I THINK THAT THIS IS THE STRUCTURE BECAUSE I THINK THE SCIENCE THE HISTORY THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE THE PHENOMENOLOGY I THINK IT ALL TELLS US THIS WE CAN PUT DIFFERENT WORDS TO IT BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT TRUTH AND HOW TO GET TO THE HAPPINESS QUOTUN QUOE THAT THAT PEOPLE HAVE SOUGHT THROUGH THE AGES MEY THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH NOW WE'VE LEARNED ENOUGH THAT WE CAN SAY OH THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND IT FITS THE ARBITER OF OF ALL TRUTH WHICH IS AS YOU GET FURTHER UP THE HIERARCHY IT GETS SIMPLER THAT'S TRUE ABOUT HUMANS WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY UNCONSCIOUSESS IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED BUT IIF THAT SUMMING TO AS WE GET HIGHER UP TO LIKE I'M APPROACHING THE WORLD WITH THE LOT OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THAT'S A LOT SIMPLER AND THAT'S WHAT CAN BE COMMON AMONG US WHICH IS WHY IF MY PILLARS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOUR PILLARS AND WHAT WE'VE STRUGGLED AGAINST EACH IS VERY DIFFERENT AND WHAT WE MAY STILL HAVE TO WORK AGAINST IS VERY DIFFERENT  WE CAN BE EXTREMELY COMPATIBLE AS FRIENDS BECAUSE ARE WE ARE WE WORKING ON OURSELVES ARE WE FOSTERING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE SO WE'RE COMING AT THE WORLD IN THAT WAY AND AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THAT'S THE SIMILARITY RIGHT BETWEEN US THAT MATTERS AND ALTIMATELY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL THAT EVERY MOMENT WE'RE BUILDING THE POTENTIAL IN US FOR WHAT COMES AT THE NEXT MOMENTWHICH IS WHY WE'RE DESCRIBING THE OVERLAPD THE POINT OF COMMONALITY THAT REALLY MATTERS THAT THAT MATTERS WE'RE PUTTING A LABEL TO IT RIG MS THAT IT'S THE GENERATIVE DRIVE BUT IT IS ALSO THAT K WE BOTH COMETH THE WORLD THROUGH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE KNOW IF TWO PEOPLE ARE ACSESSING COMPATIBILITY BUT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING TO NEST THAT UNDER AND WHAT SEEMS MOST LOGICAL IS THE SET OF POTENTIALS WITHIN US THAT WE'RE BUILDING AND ALTERING EACH MOMENT AND THEN AS I ALTER IT IN THIS MOMENT B IT'S ALTERED AND HAT EFFECTS MY NEXT MOMENT RIGHT IF I DO SOMETHING THAT'S JUST KIND OF THOUGHTLESS TO SOMEBODY YOU KNOW BECAUSE I'M IN A A'M IN A BAD MOOD RIGHT THEN WHAT AM MI DOING ON PROJECTING OUT MY AGGRESSION O'M DOING SOMETHING THAT BASILY MAKES ME LESS THAN RIGHT AND THEN I'M GOING TO FEEL LESSON THE NEXT MOMENT WHETHER THAT MOMENT IS ABOUT MEERE IS ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE THE DRIVES ARE THE POTENTIALS IN US BUT WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON THEM DETERMINING THEM CHANGING THEM EACH MOMENT I'M WELL ON BOARD THE IDEA THAT THE I THE TYPICAL PERRINGS ILET'S CALL THEM THE IDIOSENCRATIC PERINGS OF YOU KNOW MUSICIAN WITH MUSICIAN IN MANY CASES BUT YOU'L SOMETIMES VERY VERBAL PERSON WITH QUIETER PERSON YOU INTROVERT WITH EXTRAVERT OR INTRVERT WITHINTROVER THAT ALL OF THAT TAKES BACEET OR IT PERHAPS EVEN BACKBACKEAT PERHAPS IT EVEN IS OUT OF THE VEHICLE COMPARED TO THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF GENERATIVE DRIVE RI WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GENERATIVE DRIVES IN INDIVIDUALS YOU BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBED WHAT A GENERATIVE DRIVE IS AND HOW IT SHOWS UP IN INDIVIDUALS WHEN THINKING ABOUT GENERATIVE DRIVES IN ROMANTIC REL ATIONSHIPS HOWEVER BECAUSE GENERATIVE DRIVE CAN BE EXPRESSED TO VARYING DEGREES DOES ONE OFTEN SEE THAT OR DO YOU THINK THAT A MATCHING OF SORT OF LEVELS OF GENERATIVE DRIVES IS WHAT FOSTERS THE BEST RELATIONSHIPS IN OTHER WORDS LET'S SAY SOMEBODY HAS A PRETTY HIGH PLEASURE DRIVE M BUT NOT U VERY STRONG AGGRESSIVE ALSO PALSO CALL PROACTIVENESS DRIVE AND SO MAYBE THEY THEREUM THEY WATCH A LOT ON NAT FLICS LIKE A LOT ON NAT FLICS BUT THERE'RE NOT EVEN THE SORT OF PERSONS LIKE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE SHOWS AND TELLING YOU ABOUT THEM CAUSE HERE'S A VERSION OF WATCHING A LOT ON ATFLICTS WHERE THE PERSON IS I REAL INTEREST IN LEARNING AND KNOWING MAYBE EVEN THERE THINKING ABOUT WRITING A WRITING SOMETHING YOU KNOW POETRY OR BOOK OR OR THE BRINGING SOME OF THAT TO THEIR LIFE RIGHT I MENTIONED THAT WAY BECAUSE WATCHING NAT FLICKS IS 'N BAD PER SAY WRIGHT IT'S NOT ANTI GENERATIVE IS THER IGT AN ESCAPE OR IS IT GENERATIVE IS A PERSON THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY'REGOING TO DOTHEGING TO WRITE THAT BOOK OR ARE THEY JUST TRYING TO NOME OU AND AT THE END OF FIVE HOURS IN FRONT OF THE TELL OF ISION THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE FIVE HOURS WHERE IT THERE'S NO INTRINSIC VALUE JUDGMENT BASED UPON A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE MAY INTRINSIC VALU WE MAKE VALUE JUDGMENTS ABOUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHO IS THE PERSON WHAT IS THE CONTEXT ARE THEY BEING GENERATIVE OR NOT YES SOME OF THE MOVIESAN SHOWS THAT I'VE WATCHIN RELATIONSHIPS BECAME THE THE POINTS OF CONNECTION AROUND BUT AT LEAST TO ME TREMENDOUSLY INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS ON HIKES THAT WE TOOK THE NEXT DAY AND UM AND REFLECTIONS ON OUR OWN RELATIONSHIP AND WORK IN LIFE AND SO I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU POINT OUT THAT THERE'S NOTHING INTRINSICALLY VALUABLE OR OR UM INVALUABLE ABOUT  SOMETHING LIKE NAT FLIKS UM OR EVEN INTRINSICALLY PASSIVE ABOUT DOING WRIT SOMETHING LIKE SITTING ROUND OR R EVEN READING BOOKS FOR THAT MATTER THERE'S A PASSIVE VERSION OF READING GREAT BOOKS ALSO PEOPLE FORGET THAT IT'S HARD TO READ A REAT BOOK CAN NOT LEARN SOMETHING I GUESS THAT'S WHYT THEY CALLD GREAT BOOKS BUT UM BUT THERE IS AVERSION OF THAT I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HEPLWE WANT A ZESS THE BOOK I READ THE BOOK AN ONGEN A CHECK IT OFF I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT LIKE PEOPLE DO THAT THAT IS NOT GENERATIVE SO SHOULD WE CONSIDER NATHING OF LEVEL OR EXPRESSION OF GENERATIVE DRIVES AS NAM PERHAPS THE WHAT WE ARE ALL SEEKING IN SEEKING RELATIONSHIP TT THAT AND DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE TEND TO PAIR UP A NATURALLY PERUP WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE A SIMILAR LEVEL OF GENERATIVE DRIVE OR IF THEY DON'T DO YOU THINK IT LEADS TO PROBLEMS II THINK THAT BY ENLARGE PEOPLE DON'T THAT IT'S NOT THE THING THAT WERE THINKING ABOUT AND LOOKING FOR IN OURSELVES OR OTHERS AND I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT IT MAKES PROBLEMS AND LET'S TAKE A LOOT DO NOT LOOK IT MAKES PROMISE DO NOT LOOK RIGHT IT EXT SENTS TOBITE THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT BASING IT UPON GENERATIVE DRIVE IT DOES INDEED I THINK MAKE MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY AND IN FACT COUNTLESS PROBLEMS AND I WOULD TAKE AS AN EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF A TRAMABOND IA DRAMABOND IS NOT A BAD THING A SOUNDS LIKE A STRONG STATEMENT BECAUSE THE WAY THAT I HEAR TRAMABOND USED IS IS A BAD THING IBUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SO SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE WHAT PEOPLE CALL A TRAMABON AND IF YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO LET JUST WHAT WILL MAKE UP A SITUATION RI THEYTHEYTHEY'RE FUNCTIONING IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM BUT THEY EACH HAVE HAD SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT DRAMA THAT IS CREATING ISSUES IN THEM SO LETS SAY THEY'RE AVOIDANCE ISSUES PERSON DOESN'T FEEL SAFE OR COMFORTABLE IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM THEY GET INVITED TO PLACES THAT THEY LIKE TO GO BUT THEY DON'T GO I THEY WANT TO GO TO THE MUSAM AND SEE SOMETHING REALLY NEW AND COOL THERE BUT THERE MIGHT BE A CROWD RI MEAN THIS HAPPENS RIGHT LENCE THAT YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO BOTH HAVE THIS IN THEM IT COULD BE BECAUSE THE TRAMA IS SIMILAR THE TRAMA COULD BE NIGHT AND DAY I BUT THEY EACH HAVE THIS IN THEM THEY COULD BOND AROUND THAT DRAMA IN A WAY HT THAT WORSENS THE TRAMA THAT'S WHY PEOPLE THINK NEGATIVELY OF A TRAMABOND RIGHT SO I IF THE CASE IS THAT THE TRAMABON IS NOT A GOOD THING FOR THESE TWO PEOPLE O SAY WHY IS THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM HAVE HAD TRAMA AND BOTH OF THEM ARE IMPACTED BY TRAMA AND BOTH OF THEM ARE IMPACTED BY TRAMA IN SIMILAR WAYS IT'S NOT THAT IT'S THAT THE DRIVES ARE NOT IN A HEALTHY PLACE AND THE GRATIFICATION OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THE PLEASURE DRIVES ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH SO LET'S IMAGINE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS COULD BE RELATIVELY LOW IN IN EACH OF THESE PEOPLE AND ONE OR THE OTHER OR THEY COULD HAVE A NATURALLY HIGH DRIVE THAT'S BEING FORDED RIGHT SO SO THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S OUT OF BALANCE WHERE THE DRIVE IS THE THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS THE DRIVE RIGHT IS THERE ENOUGH AGENCY RIGHT IF THERE'S NOT LIKE LET'S SAY ONE PERSON IS REALLY REALLY SHUT DOWN THAT PERSONT CAN'T STAND THEIR JOB RIGHT LOOK CATE SOMETHING IS SHUTTING THAT PERSON DOWN THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WISHES GREATER EXPRESSION THEY GO BACK AND LOOK AT THEMSELVES YOU CAN BRING THAT INTO LINE RIGHT BUT SOMETHING IS UT OF BALANCE AT THE TRIME THAT THE PLEASURE DRIVE MAY BE LOW OR IT MAY BE HIGH BUT IT MAY NOT BE GRATIFIED IT MAY BE THAT THAT PERSON LOVES MUSUMS AND WANTS TO GO TO THE MUSUM BUT CAN'T FIND THAT GRATIFICATION RIGHT THAT'S A POSSIBILITY THE AGGRESSION OR ASSERTION DRIVE WOULD BE ON THE LOW END RIGHT BUT IT COULD BE HIGHER MAYBE THAT PERSON FELT SAFER RIGHT THAT DRIVE WITHIN THEM HAS A LOT OF LATITUDE IN IT MAY BE IT COULD MOVE HIER RIGHT BUT SOMETHING IS OUT OF BALANCE IN THE DRIVES AND IN THEIR EXPRESSION RIGHT THAT'S THE PROBLEM TU LET'S LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE A TRAMABOND IS A GREAT THING RIGHT SO EACH OF THE PEOPLE IN THE EXAMPLE AS TRAMA AND THEY RECOGNIZE IT IN THEMSELVES AND THEY UNDERSTAND HOW IT MAKES THINGS HARDER FOR THEM AND AND THEN THAT THEI'RE COMMUNICATING THAT HOW IT MAKES IT HARD IN THE OTHER RAG SO MAYBE THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP I IN SOCIAL AVOID ANC IND SENSIBOWNABILITY BUT MAYBE THERE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT IN ONE PERSON VERSES THE OTHER SO THEN THEY CAN COME TOGETHER AND SAY LOOK THAT THWHAT'S THE GOAL OF LIFE IK I WOULD LIKE TO BE AS HEALTHY AS I CAN BE UN WORKING ON MYSELF YOU ARE TO BE AS HEALTHY AS YOU CAN BE WE WANT TO BE AS HEALTHY AS WE CAN BE AND IF WE'RE HEALTHY WE ALSO HELP EACH OF US BE HEALTHY SO MAYBE THOSE TWO PEOPLE NEITHER OF WHICH THEY WOULD EVER GO TO THE MUSAM ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE THE DRAMA INSIDE OF THEM IS AT A POINT IT HASN'T BEEN WORKED THROUGH OR IT'S AT A PLACE WHERE THEY JUST SIMPLY FEEL TOO VUNERABLE BUT TOGETHER THEY CAN GO TO THE MUSAM AND THEN THE BOND AROUND TRAMA HEALPS THEM BE HEALTHY THE DRIVES ARE IN A BETTER PLACE BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HAY THEIR THINGS GOING ON IN ME THAT I LIKE TO BE DIFFERENT AND BETTER AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT TWO AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT WITH ONE ANOTHER RAY SO THEY'RE IN A HEALTHIER PLACE AND THEN FROM THAT HEALTHIER PLACE THEY BUILD GREATER HEALTH SO MUCH OF WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT IN TERMS OF A FRICTION POINTS IN RELATIONSHIP CENTRES ROUND IT SEEMS COMMUNICATION OR LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE ROLE OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT TIES BACK IN EVERY WAY TO AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND AGENCY BEING SUCH A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF COMMUNICATION BECAUSE WHEREVER YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT OCAY THERE'S A POTENTIAL PROBLEM HERE A PEOPLE WITH HIGH GENERATIVE DRIVE IN THESE EXAMPLES SEEM TO BE CAPABLE OF LIKE SELF INQUIRY ASKING THE OTHER PERSON QUESTIONS THAT BRING BRING THEM CLOSER TOGETHER AND TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SELF I REASE THIS BECAUSE ONE THING THAT'S OFTEN OVERHEARD OR THAT I'VE OVERHEARD OF COURSE I'VE SIBLINGS AND FRIENDS OR ARE OM AND ILL PLACE US IN THE THE WAY THAT I'VE MOST TYPICALLY HEARD IT BUT I'M SURE IT EXISTS ANOTHERWAYS TOO C IS I'M I IN THAT THE CONVERSATION MY HEAD IS ONE WHERE A WOMAN IS SAYING YOU NOTE THAT THEYRE WAS SOMEBODY IM ORDATING SOMEBODY AND THIKE HE'S HE'S SO CLUELESS LIKE I WISH THAT HE WOULD JUST DO THIS THING SOMETIMES THES ARE ACTS OF CHIVALRY LIKE MAYBE ITS FLOWERS OR VACATIONS BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S IT'S IM A A REQUEST OR A COMPLAINT ABOUT A LACK OF PROACTIVENESS YEW THIS IS ALSO WHAT RATCHES UP TO THES A VERY PAN STATEMENTS THAT YOU HEAR LIKE OGH THERE'S NO REAL MEN THESE DAYS OR LIKE THER'RE NO REAL MEN LEFT OR YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF THING THEU ALSO HEAR IT IN THE REVERSE RIGHT YOU HEAR MEN MAKING PAN STATEMENTS ABOUT WOMEN AND HERE WERE DOING THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF HETEROSEXUAL PARINGS BUT OF COURSE IT COULD ALL WORK JUST ALL WELL AN CONCER  WRITES IT'S EXACTLY AT ALL WORK IM IN THE CONTEXTS OF HOMOSEXUAL PARINGS TO SO YOU HEAR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A LACK OF COMMUNICATION YOU KNO K MAYBE ONE PERSON NEEDS TO BE BETTER AT ASKING FOR THEIRE NEEDS TO BE MET MAYBE THE OTHER PERSON NEEDS TO DEVELOP MORE OFO AN AWARENESS OF WHAT THE THER PERSON NEEDS OF COURSE WE ALL SEEM TO KIND OF INTRINSICALLY WISH THAT I'M THINGS WHICH JUST HAPPEN FOR US WITHOUT THE THE NEED TO REQUEST THEM OR ASK FOR THEM BUT I'M REALIZING AGAIN THAT ALL OF THAT IS IS DISTRACTING COMMOTION BECAUSE THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IT SEEMS IS THAT THE ENGINE BEHIND  COMMUNICATION THE ENGINE BEHIND CURIOSITY A DESIRE TO LEARN AND KNOW AND CREATE SOMETHING FROM THAT LEARNING AND KNOWING IN THE RELATIONSHIP THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS REALLY WHAT'S THE ISSUE ERE THE LACK OF GENERATIVE DRIVE IN ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS IT SEEMS ONE COULD CIRCLE BACK TO THAT AN O KE WELL SOME ONE'S NOT ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND THEREFORE NOT DOING THE RIGHT THINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY DON'T EITHERE HAVE A SENSE OF AGENTSY OR THEY DON'T HAVE GRATITUDE FOR THE SITUATION THEREIN INCLUDING THEIR OWN ABILITY TO DO THAT RIGHT SO WHEN YOU HEAR YOU KNOW PEOPLE AREN'T SHOWING UP FOR THE RELATIONSHIP THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP OR YOU KNOW SHE'S N NOT SHOWING UP WORK AGAIN WHAT'S MAKE THE PANSTAYMEN GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION THAT YOU KNOW UM THAT SOMEBODY JUST WANTS A LOT OF ATTENTION RIGHT THEY JUST NEED AN EXCESS AMOUNT OF ATTENTION WON'T LET ME DO MY OWN THING BUT ALSO WANTS ME TO WORK AND BE SUCCESSFUL YOU KNOW AGAIN THESE ARE STERIOTYPES BUT ALL OF THAT SEEMS VERY DISTRACTING HOWEVER ALL OF IT SEEMS FAR SIMPLER IF WE PUSH IT THROUGH THIS FILTER OF GENERALY DRIVES AND WHETHER NOT ITS BEING EXPRESSED YES YES I I THINK MAYBE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO HIGHLY CHARGED IS IMAGINE THAT THE PLEASURE DRIVE THROUGH THE LENTS OF SEX AND SEXUALITY I SO IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE ARE IN A PARING THERE INER RELATIONSHIP PROGOSS F HOW THEY GOT THEY WERE TAKING PEOPLE IN A RELATIONSHIP AND ONE HAS A A SEX DRIVE WITH WHICH MEANS AN INTERESTIN SEX AND MAYBE A PROCLIVITIES FOR DIVERSITY OF SEXUAL EXPERIENCE THAT SAY IF WE JUST FORSAKE OF THIS EXAMPLE WE PUT ON A ONE TO TEN SCALE THAT THAT PERSON IS A TO OK NOW S AT THE OTHER PERSON IN THE GAN BEING THE GREATEST YES I RIGT A IN SISO TELL ME RIGHT THAT PERSON IS A TO NOW LET'S SAY THE PARTNER IS AN EGHT OK SO SO THERE'S A BIG MISMATCH THERE YOU THINK HOW DOES THAT NORMALLY GO THE TWO STAYS A TWO THE EIGHT STAYS IN EIGHT AND THINKS DON'T GO WELL RIGHT IT CRATES FRICTION IN THE RELATIONSHIP AT A MINIMUM IT BLOWS HA RELATIONSHIP APART AT A MAXILUM THE PERSON WHO'S A TOO FEELS INADEQUATE OFTEN IT MEANS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT BUT BUT THIS HOW THES OFTIN GOES PERSON WIS A TWO FEELS ANADEQUATE AUS THE PERSON WHO'S AN EIHTE WANTS EITHER MORE OR DIFFEREND TO RIGHT AND THE PERSON IS AT EVISITE TO DOESNIT NOW THAT PERSON FEELS BAD AND THEY ME FUL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES OR RESENTFUL OF THE PERSON WITH THE HIGHER SEX DRIVE THE PERSON ON THE HIGHER LEVEL FEELS NOW RESENTFUL OF THE PERSON THE LOWER LEVEL OR MAY BE THEY FEEL LIKE THER SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM BECAUSE THEIR SEX RIVES TOO HIGH OR THEY HAVE AN INTEREST THAT THAT THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T HAVE ANNOW THEY START LABELLING THEMSELVES LIKE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE IME AND IT DOESN'T CHANGE MOST OF THE TIME AND THE PROBLEMS ARE ENORMOUS LOOK I SO SO LET'S SEE HOW COULD THAT LOOK HOW WOULD THAT LOOK WITH REALLY HIGH GENERATIVE DRIVES AND THEREFORE THE ABILITY TO THINK ABOUT SELL TO THINK ABOUT OTHERS AND TO THINK ABOUT TUS OF THE SITUATION WRITE THE TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER I SO THEY BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT EN WAYS THAT WOULDN'T BE FAULTING OF THE OTHER AND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT'S INSIDE OF THEM LIKE THE PERSON WITH THE LOWER DRIVE COULD SAYOUKNOW IT JUST THE THING DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS MORE INTERESTING DON'T THINK ABOUT IT WHET THEY COULD TALK ABOUT ALL OF THAT THE PERSON WHO WISHES MORE OR WISHES DIFFERENT COULD TALK ABOUT THAT TOO WRITING COULD TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY FEEL INSIDE THERE'S A FRUSTRATION OF THAT JUST LIKE THE PERSON WITH THE LOWER SEX DRIVE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW FRUSTRATING IT FEELS TO FEEL PRESSURE IT RIGHT SO WHAT ARE THEY DEVELOPING THERE MENTALIZING MAKE THEY'R THINKING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S EMOTIONAL STATES AND AND THEY'RE COMING AT EACH OTHERS THROUGH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE LIKE I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR YOU ROOMS YE TH WREWERE  EXAMPLE IS THESE PEOPLE ARE PARTNERS AND THEYI'R HAPPY WITH THEIR PARTNERSHIP LIKE ALL MI GOT I'M SO GRATEFUL I FOUND YOU RIT THEY WOULD EACH FEEL THAT WAY I'M SO GRATEFUL YEAR IN MY LIFE LIKE THIS HAPPENS TOO RIGHT AND THEN FROM THAT ONES YOU KNOW THE TWO ISN'T GOING TO BECOME IN ATE THE AID ISN'T GOING TO BECOME AT TOO RIGHT BUT IN GENERAL IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS THERE CAN BE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE RIGHT ADAND LET LET'S SAY THE TOO YOU DON'T BESAUSETHEY LOOK YOU KNOW IDN GET OUT OF MY COMFORTS SON A LITTLE BIT WHY DON'T MOST PEOPLE TRY THAT CAUSE THEY FEEL EMBARRASSE THEY FEEL SELF CONSCIOUS YOU THEY THEY DON'T WANT TO TRY NEW THINGS OR TRYING ONE OF PEOPLE GET CLOTHES DOWN BECAUSE THEYRE'S SUCH SHAME AROUND SEXUALITY DO OU TAKE PEOPLE ON ANY SPECTRUM OF SEXUALITY AND YOU WILL FIND SHAME YOU KNOW NOT IN EVERY PERSON BUT ACROSS WHATEVER POPULATION WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE IT'S SO EMOTIONALLY CHARGE SO LET'S SAY IN A LOVING CARRYING RELATION SHIP LIKE THAT PERSON FEELS THE FREEDOM INSIDES THAT YOU KNOW OT MAYBE I COULD ENJOY SECS A LITTLE MORE LITTLE MORE OFTEN A LITTLE MRE INVAT THAT PERSON THINKS ABOUT LIKE SOMEBODY WHO'S AT IT TOO CAND THEN MOVE THAT TO A DIFFERENT PLACE YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE OR MAYBE EVEN A LOT MORE DEPENDING AND THEN THE PERSON WHO'S AT THE HIGHER LEVEL YOU NONT IT THE EIGHT DOESN'T NEED ANOTHER EIGHT RIGHT IN ORDER TO SAY IN  RELATIONSHIP BUT BUT SOMETHING MAY BE MORE THAN A TOO RIGHT AND THEN LET'S SAY THEY COME INTO THE MIDDLE AND THEN THE PERSON WHO'S IN AIGHT REALIZES LIKE LOOK I LOVE YOU AND YOU LOVE ME AND IN YOU YOU ADT OF YOUR COMFORTS OWN RIGHT IN ORDER TO DO THIS IN LIKE AN LOUNE IS LIKE MORE FOND FOR BOTH OF US SO LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S OCATE MY HIGHER SEX RI'VE ALL DEAL WITH THAT THAT MAYBE JUST MAKING IT UP LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT THREE TIMES WE WERE DOING IT TT TOO OOK AT YOU KNOW IT THAT THAT'S FINE BOTH SIDES CAN LIVE WITH IT BUT IT IS NOT FREDBARE SIC WELL THEY CAN LIVE WITH ITS LIKE NUMBER ONE THEY CAN LIVE WITH IT NUMBER TOO IT'S BETTER IT'S BETTER RIGHT THE TWO AT ONE POINT WAS THINKING A ANYTHING MORE THAN A TOO AS I CAN'T DO THAT RAY IS SHUT DOWN ON THE EIGHT IS ONE ANYTHING LESS THAN AN EIGHT NOW THAT IN THE MIDDLE IN THE RELATIONSHIP IS CLOSER THAT'S REAL THAT HAPPENS WHAT IS IT RELYING UPON IT'S RELYING UPON THE GENERATIVE DRIVE HAV THE OPENES TE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE MAYBE THE PERSON WHO'S AN EGHT SAY HAS A SEXUAL PROCLIVITY THERE EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME TOO BUT IN THE SENSE OF ACCEPTANCE OFSELF  AN AN THE BELIEF IN THE THE STRENGTH OF THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE ACCEPTANCE O THE OTHER N PEOPLE CAN BROACH THINKS MOST PEOPLE WHO FEE LIKE I COULD NEVER BROACH THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING BAZAR OR DANGERS LIKE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S THAT'S DEFYINED BY THE GENRATIVE DRIVE THE OTHER PERSON IS LIKELY TO REJECT SO LET'S THE FIND OUR RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND LET'S CULTIVATE INSELF AND OTHERS THE MOST GENERATIVE DRIVE IF SOMEHOW PERTLESS A PERSON A IN PERSON BE HERE CASE DOESN'T MATTER WHO'SE THE EIHT AND WHOS THE TOO HAS CULTIVA IT ID MORE OF A GENERATIVE DRIVE THEN MAYBE THAT PERSON COULD GIVE MORE TO THE OTHER BEFORE THAT PERSON CAN GIVE BACK TO THEM YOU KNOW WLY HAVE THESE I THINK IS NCOMPLETELY NONSENSICAL IDEAS ABOUT MUTUALITY WRIGHT THE IDEA THAT EVEN IN A SITUATION THAT SUPPOSED TO BE DEFINED BY LOVE RIGHT AND IN A FRIENDSHIP IS A FORM OF LOVE RIGHT SO FRIENDSHIP I'M A COLLABORATIVE I ENDEAVOR RIGHTLY LIE THESE T THEY HAVE THEY HAVE SOME AFFECTION IN THAT RIGHT FRIENDSHIP CAN HAVE LOVE AND OFTEN DOES UNLESS THEY THE LOVE OF OF ROMANCE THAT THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOME EQUALITY RIGHT THEY O THE IDEA THAT WILL FONGIN TO GIVE SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO GIVE SOMETHING TOU IT IS NOT GOOD IF ONE PERSON IS ALWAYS DOING THE GIVING THINGS ARE OUT OF BALANCE BUT IT IS VERY HEALTHY TO BE ABLE TO SAY YOU KNOW IF I CAN GIVE SOMETHING IN YOU'R NOT IN THE PLACE TO GIVE SOMETHING LEME TOUS GIVE SOMETHING TO YOU RIGHT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS OR MAYBE DON'T OFTEN DEPEND ON HOW WE WANT LOOK AT IT GIVE TO OTHERS WITH A SENSE OF FREEDOM LIKE IT AND YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING EITHER RIGHT WHY BECAUSE IT COMES FROM LOVE IT COMES FROM THE ABUNDANCE THA THE THE ACCESS OF GOODNESS IN ME COMING THROUGH THE THE THE AGENCY THAT I FEEL THE GRATITUDE THAT I FEEL AND THEN WHAT'S MORE LIKELY YOUR MUCH MORE LIKELY THE OTHER PERSON RIGHT TO TO SUTO FILQE I CAN GO A LITTLE MHRE YOU FEEL STRONGER YOU FEEL IN POWERD MAKING SOME ONE FEEL WORSE OR SAYING YOU KNOW I CAN GIVE YOU SOMETHING BUT YOU OWE ME SOMETHING BACK RIGHT EVEN IF THAT'S TACIT RIG LWI'LL GIVE YOU KNOW I AN GIVE YOU THIS NOW BUT YOU KIND OF KNOW THAT THE OTHER PERSON CAN END OF DOING THE LAUNDRY FOR TWO MONSTERS UNLIKE THIS NO O GET WHEN I JUST GIVE SOMETHING RIGHT YOUR GIVING GOODNESS AND THEN THE OTHER PERSON ACTUALLY GETS THE GOODNESS AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO FIND IT WITHIN THEMSELVES RIGHT TO TO THEN COME A LITTLE OUT OF THEIR COMFORTS OWN DEVELOP AT YOU MOVE THEIR GENERATIVE DRIVE A LITTLE BIT FORWARD SO SO GIFTS GIVEN TO OTHERS WITH NO EXPECTATION OF RETURN AR GIVTS OF ABUNDANCE THEIR GIFTS THAT ARISE FROM THE GENERATIVE D RIVE AND THEY MAKE US MORE GENERATIVE THINK ABOUT THE OPPOSITE WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS EACH PRISON MAKES THE OTHER FEEL GUILTY IHT I OH UDISPRESL WANCS YOU WANT SO MUCH N LOOK THERE YOU ARE AGAIN LIKE PEOPLE FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THAT OR NOTHER YOU DON'T WANT ANY SAGS TO DISTA THAT THE OTHER PRISON FEELS TERRIBL THAT'S WHY THE TWO STAYS THE TWO IN THE EIGHT SAVS THE EIGHT I BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY AND IT'S ALSO NOT THAT IF BOTH AND UP IN THE MIDDLES IF BOTH ARE FIVE THAT THAT'S SOME COMPROMISED POSITION THAT IMPLIES LESS NO THAT'S THE COMPROMISED POSITION THAT MAKES MORE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKES SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY I'VE SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT THE FACT THAT GETTING A QUALITY NIGHT SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING WELL EVERYTHING GOES BETTER AND WHEN WE ARE NOT SLEEPING WELL OR ENOUGH EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE GETS FAR WORSE VERY QUICKLY ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP AS TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOU NEED YOUR COOR BODY TEMPERATURE TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED YOU NEED YOUR COOR BODY TEMPERTURE TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES THAT ALL BECOMES VERY EASY WHEN USING AND EIT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO PROGRAM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AT THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP I STARTED SLEEPING ON AN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER OVER TWO YEARS AGO AND IT IMMEDIATELY AND PERSISTENTLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND DEPTH OF MY SLEEP AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I WAKE UP FEELING FAR MORE REFRESHED I HAVE ENHANCED MOOD FOCUS AN ALERTNESS THROUGHOUT THE DAY IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMENT TO SAVE UP TO A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR PD THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U SA CANIDA U K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE U AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOCT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THE AGGRESSIVE ALSO RECALLING THE PROACTIVENESS DRIVE IN THE PLEASURE DRIVE AND THE IMPORTANT CE OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE BEEN GREATER THAN THE AGGRESSIVE OR PLEASURE DRIVES I CAN ALSO SEE THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM OF HAVING LIKE TWO EIGHTS IALONG THE TI SHOW DESIRE SCALE OR TWO NINES A OR TWO TENDS AND I SHULD HAVE OBSERVED A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF THIS A FOR INSTANCE IF THERE BUT TAY TWO NINES THER BOTH PEOPLE NINE OW TEN ON THE ON THE A JOY AN A SORT OF PRECLIMITY FOR SAX ADVENTUROUS EX ET CETERA  THE VERY HIGH ON THE PLEASURE SCALE PERHAPS EVEN SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE ONE PERSON DOESN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE CRITICAL NEED FOR POINTS OF COMPATIBILITY TO BE MET LIKE THE DESIRE TO SOME DAY HAVE A FAMILY I'VE KNOWN COUPLES LIKE THIS THEY'RE TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME THEY SEEM TO REALLY ENJOY ONE ANOTHER I KNOW NOTHING OF THEIR SEX LIVES BUT THERE JUST SEEMS TO BE A VERY STRONG ATTACHMENT AROUND CERTAIN FORMS OF PLEASURE THAT THEY BOTH ENJOY ENGAGING IN SAYS COULBE A ACTIVITIES OR TRAVEL I BEEN HERE WER WERE SAYING YOUR NIN OT OF TENON ON ON THE SEX SCALE BUT IN MANY OF THOSE CASES THERE'S ONE PERSON SAYING YOU KNOW BUT I WON'T HAVE A FAMILY SOME DAY AND THEY'RE JUST NOT INTO THAT OR PERHAPS EVEN LIKE BUT HE WON'T LEAVE HIS WIFE YOU KNOW THERE THAY INVOLVED IN SOMETHING THAT FEELS REALLY GOOD THEY'RE MATCHING ALONG SOME SET PLEASURE DRIVE BUT COMPLETELY OVERLOOKING THE LARGER GOALS OF ONE OR BOTH PEOPLE I END I'M IN IT YOU KNOW HERE I POINTED TO AN INSTANCE OF INFIDELITY THAT'S ITS OWN YOU KNOW IT ISSUES WITH MORALS ET CETERA BUT YOU SEE THIS A LOT THE PEOPLE REALLY ORIENTING TOWARDS WHAT FEELS GOOD AND WHO FEELS GOOD TO BE WITH AND THAT OF COURSE IS HEALTHY BUT THAT'S NOT THE ENTIRE PICTURE SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT WHAT I'M DESCRIBING IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE PLEASURE DRIVE HAS OVERCOME THE GENERATIVE DRIVE BECAUSE IN THE CASE OF SOMEBODY WANTING A FAMILY AND THE OTHER PERSON ALREADY HAVING ONE AND BEING UNWILLING TO LEAVE THAT ONE OR THE OTHER PERSON NOT WANTING A FAMILY A THAT  THE GENERATIVE DRIVE OF THE THE PERSON WHO A WHO WANTS A FAMILY IS IS NOT BEING RESPECTED IT'S ORE ITS BEING UNDERMINE BY THIS EXCESS DESIRE FOR PLEASURE LIKE THEY'RE JUST DRAWN INTO THE MOMENT AND THE THE AMANZING WEEK ENDS AND THEIR BUT THIS PERSON'S INCREDIBLE AND THEIR CURRAS MADIC AND A I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES THAT FRIENDS SAY THAT A YO THEY ARE THEY ADMIRE THE PERSON THEREWITH BUT THEY KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP CAN'T WORK BECAUSE OF ALL THESE OTHER UNDERLYING ISSUS RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT THIS ITS INTERESTING WWE BOTH OVER ESTIMATE AND UNDER ESTIMATE WHAT SAY LOVE CAN DO RIGHT YEVES ALL LOVE CAN DO ANYTHING NO IF I SPILL THAT GLASS LOVES NOT CAN PUT THE WATER BACK IN IT RIGHT IF I MUST LIVE IN NORTH AMERICA AND MY PARTNER MUST LIVE IN SOUTH AMERICA LIKE WE'RE NOT BEEN TO BEO CA RIGHT SO WE SAY THESE THINGS IN A VERY WISHFUL WAY LOVE WILL OVERCOME EVERYTHING LIKE AS HAS NEVER COME BACK RIHT OR MAYBE IT DOES IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES SO THINK ABOUT IF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS VERY VERY HIGH RIGHT IN BOTH PEOPLE SO BOTH PEOPLE HAVE SAY A STRONG NEED TO LIVE IN A CERTAIN PLACE THEY CAN'T FIND A COMPROMISED POSITION MAYBE THEY LIVE HALF THE OR NORTH AMERICA AND HALF IN SOUTH AMERICA BUT WHY BECAUSE IN THAT SITUATION THE LOVE BETWEEN THEM THE WHICH WHICH IS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IN THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THE FIRST PERSON HAS TO HAVE A STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE BE HEALTHY UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN THOUGH II NEED TO LIVE IN NORTH AMERICA IGHT DOESN'T DISACTUALLY MEAN THAT THEY RELEANIN TO LIVE IN NORTH AMERICA RIGHT HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE BEYOND MYSELF AND  WHAT IS THAT MEAN TO THE PERSON I LOVE WHO NEEDS TO LIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD IF THE OTHER PERSON CAN DO THAT TOO THEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP IGHT WHICH IS A NEW ENTITY RIGHT IT EMERGES FROM ONE PERSON AN THE OTHER YOU CAN KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ONE PERSON EVERYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER I SO THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER ARE AND US AND IF THAT US HAS A STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE WHICH IT CAN IF IF EACH PERSON HAS A STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE THEY CAN BRING TO THE STATE OF EMERGENCE OF THE US THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THAT'S THE WRETIME ABOTTER RELATIONSHIPS AS THY THE LOVE BETWEEN THEM AND THEY CAN FIND A WAY THROUGH SO THE IDEA THAT LOVE CURES ALL THINGS AT WHICH OS FINDING WHAT IS THAT ACTUALLY MEAN RIGHT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'VE A LOT OF PLEASURE TOGETHER RIGHT OR WE LIKE A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS LIKE THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT MEANS AND PEOPLE CAN VERY VERY MUCH LOVE ONE ANOTHER BUT NOT BE AWARE OF THE LIMITATIONS INSIDE OF THEM RIGHT BECAUSE MAYBE THERRE OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN THAT LIKE A CHILDHOOD TROMA THEY LOVE ONE ANOTHER BUT THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF THEIR COMFORTS OWN ENOUGH RIGHT SO THE PLONTS IF WE MAKE  OURSELVES AS HEALTHY AS WE CAN BE AND THEN TOO SELVES COME TOGETHER THAT ER MAKING THEMSELVES AS HEALTHY AS THEY CAN BE TAND US BETWEEN THEM REALLY CAN FIT THAT DEFINITION OF OF LOVE AND DO ANYTHING BUT WE HAVE TO DEFIND THAT IN THE RIGHT WAY IN A WAY THAT HONORS THE TRUTH WHICH AGAIN IS NOT A HIGHER DEGREE OF COMPLEXITY IT'S ACTUALLY MORE SIMPLE SO YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WHERE ONE PERSON HAS A STRONG SEX DRIVE IN THE OTHER A WEAKER DRIVE AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT AN EXAMPLE AWARE BOTH PEOPLE HAVE A ESSENTIALY HIGH SEX DRIVE AND WHERE THAT COLD POTENTIALLY BE BENEFICIAL ASSUMING THAT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS ALSO HIGH IN BOTH OF THEM AND WE ALSO EXPLORED A LITTLE BIT OF HOW IT CAN BE BAD FOR RELATIONSHIP IF IT EXCEEDS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WHAT ABOUT THE AGGRESSIVE PROACTIVEN THISS DRIVE HOW DOES THAT SHOW UP IN ROMANTIC PARENTS YOU KOW IF ONE PERSON HAS A HIGH PROACTIVENESS AY GA AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND THE OTHER PERSON DOES NOT AN WHAT DES THAT LOOK LIKE AN AND DO YOU SEE THAT OFTEN IN YOUR CLINICAL PRACTICE SURE SHU IF THIS MAKE SENSE MAYBE WE LOOK AT THAT EXAMPLE OF THE PERSON WHO'S A TWO AND THE PERSON WHO'S ANADE ON THE ON THE SEX DRIVE SCALE RIGHT IT SAY OK THE PERSON WHO'S A TOO WHO'S TRYING TO TO RAISE THAT RIGHT HAS A STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE WHAT IS THAT MEAN THE PERSON THINKS YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK I CAN DO THIS I CAN SET MYSELF ABOUT THAS I SEE IT IT WILL MAKE MY RELATIONSHIP BETTE LIG IM GONG TO GIVE TO TRY THAT'S THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IN ACTION THE PLEASURE DRIVE THE PERSON MAY LOOK AT THAT AND SAILOR MAYBE THIS CAN BE MORE FUN FOR ME RALIC HASN'T BEEN THAT FUN FOR ME IF I'VE A LOW PLEASURE DRIVE COULD I START ENJOYING THIS MORE AND THAN MAYBE THAT MOVES UP RIGHT WER MAYBE HAVE A HIGHER PLEASURE DRIE BUT IT'S NOT BEEN GRATIFIED TA HAVE N IT WOULD BE OPEN AND HONEST LIKE LET ME SEE IF I CAN MAKE THAT BETTER THEN WHAT'S ACTIVE WHAT WHAT THE PERSON IS DOING IS THEN GOING TO THE AGGRESSIVE OR ASSERTIVE PROACTIVE WRIHT TO THAT DRIVE AND GOING TO THE POTENTIAL IN THAT DRIVE AND MINING SOME OF WHAT'S IN IT LIHT YA HOWM I CAN TO DO THAT I'M GOING TO BRING MYSELF TO BEAR RIGHT AND  THAT'S NOT AN EASY THING IT'S NOT LIKE THAT PERSON THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN DECIDES TO BE MORE SEXUAL RIGHT THERE HAGHT TO BE A LOT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO PEOPLE A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF WHAT WHAT SETTING MIGHT BE BEST FOR THAT WHAT HELPS THE PERSON FEEL UNDERSTOOD O FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THERE'S A LOT THEN TO DO THERE AND THE PERSON MAY EVEN MEED TO GO BACK TO THE PILLARS RIGHT AUSE THE PERSON MAY FEELIC WOE I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT RIGHT IN THEN IT IS THAT'S NOT GOOD I WANT TO DO THAT RIGHT WHAT IS IT THAT I CAN'T DO THERE'S A REALIZATION THERE AND THEN MAYBE THE PERSON WHO'S AN AID BECAUSE THEY'RE SO WELL CONNECTED GETS IT O K YOU CAN'T DO THAT LIKE LET ME SUPPORT YOU RIGHT IN WHATEVER WAY WHAT WHILE YOU'RE FIGURING THAT OUT CAUS HEY'RE BOTH GENERATIV THEY WANT A FIGURE THAT OUT NI'LL THE O SARRY TO INTERRUPT WHEN YOU SAY GO BACK TO THE PILLARS YOU MEAN GO BACK TO EXPLORING THER STRUCTURE OF THEMSELVES AND THE FUNCTION OF THEMSELVES YES THAT THEY CAN UM FOR INSTANCE GET SOME INSIDE IN TO WHAT SORTS OF DEFENCE MECHANISMS MIGHT BE IN PLACE RUM WHAT THEY PAYING ATTENTION TO OR THEIR BEHAVIORS LIKE IBE EVEN HEALTHS RELATED BEHAVIORS THEY COULD BE IMPACTING THEIR SEX DRIVE BUT BUT MAYBE VEN THINGS THAT OM RESIDED AT A DEEPER LEVEL THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND YOU KNOW TALKING TO SOMEBODY TILL THEY MAKE A CONNECTION AROUND A SHANM OR OR OR SOME STORY THAT THEY'VE INTEGRATED INTO THEIR THINKING AT A SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL RIGHT RIGHT JUST AN EXAMPLE THA I SEE A LOT IT IS AVOIDANCE WHERE GET NOT ALWAYS BUT LET'S SAY THE PERSON WITH WHO'S THE TOO ON THE SEX DRIVE SCALE WHO FINDS LIKE I CAN'T DO IT I WHILE I CANI JUST CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO DO IT RIGHT AND THEN THEY GO BACK AND THEY EXPLORT THIS HAPPENS AT THIS HAPPENS A LOT WERE THERE'S AVOIDANCE AND THEN WE GET CURIOUS ABOUT THE AVOIDANCE LIECIECAUSE THE PERSONS LIKE I JUST I SOMETHING JUST I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT RI O CASE SO THERE'S AVOIDANCE WE IDENTIFY AVOIDANCE WELS SOIDENTIFY THAT ITS NOT HEALTHY BECAUSE THE PERSON DOES ACTUALLY WANT TO DO THAT CAUSE IT'S IT'S GOOD FOR THEI RELATIONSHIP AND IT COULD BE GOOD FOR THEM TOO AND THEN MAYBE WE START LOOKING AT UNCONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT OR CONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT AND MAYBE WE DON'T FIND CAUSE IT'S IT'S EASY NOW IF I SAID OH THERE 'S A MAJOR TRAMA THAT THE PERSON HASN'T PROCESS SOMETIMES IT'S THAT BUT A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT PERSON JUST NEVER LEARNED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH SEXUALITY OR MAYBE THE WAY THAT THEY EXPERIENCE OR OR AATTRACTIV TO SEXUALITY WAS DISPARRAGED OR DENEGRATED RIGHT THOR THOR THEY HAD SOME BAD FEELING ABOUT IT CAUSE A SOCIETY IN THE CULTURE TOLD THEM THAT OR MAYBETHEY AD A COUPLE BAD EXPERIENCES WHERE THEY WERE TREATED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THEN IT'S I LOCATE THAT PERSON COMES BY THAT HONESTLY THERE'S NOT A MAJOR TRAMA THERE IN FACT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A TRAMA THAT'S ALMOST PREDICTABLE FROM THE WAY OR SOCIETY YOU KNOW HAS BEEN STRUCTURED SO PERSON CAN GO LOOK AT THAT LIK RIGHT II NEVERI NEVER LEARNED HOW TO DO THIS HOW TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS OR I KNOW I LEARNED THAT I'M NOT GOOD AT IT OR I I LEARNED THAT NO ONE WILL ENJOY IT WITH ME BUT BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE LIKE THISE  THESE ERE SITUATION NOT IN ALDESIDE OF A LOVING RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW THAT PERSON IS ABLE TO BRING THAT KNOWLEDGE TO BEAR WHETHER IT CAME FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND OR THE CONSCIOUS MIND AND THEN THAT'S HOW YOU WORK TO START SHIFTING THINGS LIKE THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW RIGHT IT IS NOT THEN WHEN SAY THE PERSON SAY IN HIGH SCHOOL HAD A SEXUALITY THAT OTHERS DIDN'T APPROVE OF AND MADE THEM FEEL BAD WILL GUESS WHAT IT'S NOT THEN AND LIKE THAT'S UNFORTUNATE IT'S WRONG IT'S UNJUST WORK AN HONOR AND VALDATE ALL THAT THAT IS BUT WE'RE ALSO CAN A LOOK AT THAT THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW AND YOU GET TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY NOW YOU'REN ADULT NOW AND IT DONS CAT TO CHOOSE THER RELATIONSHIP AND YOU CHOSE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP RIGH SO SO THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THEY CINK THAT CAN GET THAT PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN GO BACK UP THROUGH NOW WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF IT THE GUISER IS STRONGER THERE'S MORE AGENCI TERS MORE OF A SENSE OF GRATITUDE RIGHT WHY BECAUSE THE PERSON CAN ATTACH THEMSELVES MORE TO I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE THIS PERSON AS OPPOSE TO DAMN IT I WISH THAT PERSON DIDN'T HAVE A HIGHER SEX DRIVE RIGHT SO THE PERSONERS AND THEY FEEL BETTE ABOUT THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME THAT I DON'T HAVE A HIGHER SEX DRIVE RIGHT THEYR SAID TO WISH TO OTHER PERSON AT A LOWER SEX DRIVER WHISH THEY HAD A HIGHER SEX DRIE THAT'S NOT GRATEFUL LIKE I'M GRATEFUL I AM WHO I AM AND THAT I'VE ANY SEX DRIVE AT ALL UT UNGRATEFUL FOR THIS OTHER PERSON NOW THROUGH THROUGH THAT RIGHT THAT CHANGE RIGHT THEY CAN GO BACK AND BETTER ACCESS THE ASSERTION THE THEYTHE PROACTIVE DRIVE THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE WHATEVER WE WANT A CALL IT BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY THEY'VE GONE AND WORK THROUGH THE BARRIER TO IT THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO BE A LITTLE MORE OUT OF THEIR COMFORTS OWN AND THE THE OTHER ERSON MEETS THEM THEYRE RIGHT AND AND THEY START HAVING THIS THIS NOW THIS HEOALTHY THING BETWEEN THEM WHERE THE US THAT IS THEM THE LOVE BETWEEN THEM GETS BETTER RIGHT AND THEN WHERE THEY FIND THEMSELVES THAT'S HOW THEY GET TO THE FIVE WHICH IS NOT A COMPROMISE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TWO THAT SATISFIES NEITHER IT IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TWO THAT IS WAY BETTER FOR BOTH AND FOR THE RELATIONSHIP I'M CURIOUS ABOUT COMMON PERRINGS THAT YOU OBSERVE IN THE CLINICAL SUNDIN I AND NOT TO FOCUS ON THE BAD BUT IF THERE ARE COMMON PARRINGS THAT RARELY LEAD TO A GOOD OUTCOME I THINK ITS WORTH US LEARNING ABOUT THOSE IM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEYRE COMMON AND THEY LEAD TO A BAD OUTCOME AND A A DISCUSSION OF THIS SORT COULD POTENTIALLY HELP PEOPLE VOID SUCH PARRINGS OR AT LEAST RECOGNIZE THAT THEYRE IN SUCH PARENTS AND I REALIZE OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT RE FRAMING THINGS DURING THE SERIES THAT ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT A PARRING WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT TWO MAPS COMING TOGETHER FORMING A NEW AND SOMEWHAT INDEPENDENT MAP THAT REPRESENTS THE RELATIONSHIP I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HAVE MAPS THAT ARE VERY VERY HEALTHY AND THERE PROBABLY EVEN THOSE RARE INDIVIDUALS THAT DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THOSE CUPBOARDS THAT RESIDE WITH IN STRUCTURE OFSELF AND FUNCTION OFSELF AND DO ANY WORK BUT A SO SMUT FOR THOSE WE THERE JUST LISTENING O NOT WATCHING AS OMS OUR SMILING AS SOM SAYING THAT BECAUSE I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE ANY PER SUCH PERSE THAN EXISTS I THINK ALL OF US EVEN THE HEALTHIEST AMONG US COULD BE EVEN HEALTHIER AND EXPRESS MORE GENERATIVE DRIVE AN MORE POSITIVITY FOR OURSELVES AND FOR THE WORLD SO WE TO DO THAT HOSO IT'S  IT'S A IS LIFE IS LO AND POINT TO THAT THAT'S BEAUTIFUL WE CAN DO THAT FOR EVER AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE AND SHOULD II DO BELIEVE  WHICH IS  ONE OF THE REASONS FOR HAVING THIS DISCUSSION ACTYNONE THE LESS I I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE PERHAPS MOST PEOPLE WHO STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND THOSE WORDS A LOT PERHAPS THAT ARE IN BOLD FACED CAPITAL UNDERLINE HIGH LIGHTED LETTERS RIGHT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE SEE RELATIONSHIPS IN THE WORLD THAT ARE NOT HEALTHY WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE COMMON UNHEALTHY PARINGS I THINK IT'S WORTH SPENDING AT LEAST SO A BIT OF TIME ON THIS YEYEFOR AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS I THINK THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SO TO SOMEWHAT SIMPLIFIED BUT HOPEFULLY HELPEFUL DISTINCTION RIGHT SO THERE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING AT COUPLING FROM PRIMARILY HEALTH RIGHT AND AGAIN THIS ISN'T TO CRITICIZE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T COMING AT IT FROM PRIMARILY HEALTH WHY WE WE ALL WANT TO GET TO WHERE WERE COMING AT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING FROM PRIMARILY HEALTH AND THERE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS ARE THOSE SIMPLE THINGS LIKE WHY CANT BELIEVE IT DIDN'T WORK OUT I PLAY THE TRUMPET AND HE PLAYS THE CLARONET IS NO THAT WASN'T A REAL SET OF FACTORS THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WORK ATLIC IT'S MORE IN THAT REALM ITS NOT ALWAYS JUST THAPIT LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF AS A BIG FACTOR RIGHT WHEN WE LOOK IN THE OTHER REALM WHERE WERE THERE'S A SIGNA SIGNIFICANTLY PROBLEMATIC MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES RIGHT WHICH WHICH PEOPLE COME BY HONESTLY BUT NEED TO FACE IF LIFE IS GOING TO GET BETTER RIGHT THERE ARE TOO COMMON PARADIMES THERE NOW IN THEIR WAY MORE THAN TWO WAYS THIS CAN HAPPEN BUT 'M IN A HIGH LIGHT TOO THAT WE SEE A LOT AND MAY BE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN IN THE CLINICAL SETTING SO THE FIRST GETS CALLED REPETITION COMPULSION RIGHT BUT DON'T BE VERY VERY CLEAR I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY SUCH THING IS A REPETITION COMPULSION A COMPULSION IS SOMETHING THAT ONE CANNOT CONTROL T WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THE PERSON IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED WHEN THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS THAT LEAD TO REPEATING A CYCLE AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CAN CHANGE RIGHT DO NOT HAVE TO BE COMPULSIVE SO PEOPLE ARE OFTEN STRUCK BY WHY A PERSON IS IN THE SAME BAD RELATIONSHIP SEEMINGLY THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN BUT WITH A A DIFFERENT NAME ON THE OTHER PERSON RIGHT THAN PEOPLE WILL SAY THIS LIKE IT'S THAT PERSONS FORTH ABUSE OF RELATIONSHIP IN A ROW AND IT SEEMS TO BE JUST THE SAME PERSON WITH A DIFFERENT NAME LIKE THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT A LOT THEY SAY THAT ABOUT THEMSELVES THIY SAY THAT ABOUT OTHERS AND IT'S VERY VERY BAFFLING YIU MEAN OU PEOPLE HAVE OFTEN BEEN IN MY OFFICE VERY UPSET ABOUT THAT LIKE REALIZING THER REPEATING AND THEY DON'T KNOW IN IT'S FRIGHTENING AND  NO YOU CAN GET A LOT OF A FEAR AND MONABILITY FROM THAT BUT THERE'S A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING IT THAT BECAUSE ARE ARE THE TELYMBIC SYSTEM RIHT THE EMOTIONAL PARTS OF OUR MINDS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CLOCK IN THE CALENDAR I SO DRAMA IMPACTS WE COMPACTS THE WHOLE BRAIN BUT TRAMA IMPACTS THE LYMBIC SYSTEM IT CREATES STRONG NEGATIVE EMOTION THAT THEN STAYS WITH US REGARDLESS OF TIME IT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT TIME SO IMAGINE NOW A PERSON GETS IN IRRELATIONSHIP AND THE RELATIONSHIP STARTS TO BECOME ABUSER I MEAN IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT AND THEN MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE WHAT'S THAT LIKE FOR THAT PERSON WHAT IS THAT FEEL LIKE WHEN THAT PERSON WHO THEY MAY HAVE SEEN AS A PROTECTOR OF FRIEND I IT IT IS NOW CURSING AT THEM DENEGRATING THEM PUSHING THEM HITTING THE AN IT'S TERRIFYING IT'S HORRIBLE I SO IT IS A DEEP IMPACT THE TRAMATIC IMPACTE ON THE PERSON AND A LOT OF THE TIME MOST OF THE TIME LIKE ALL TRAMA IT TRIGGERS SHAME I SO TRAMA TRIGGERS SHAME IN US IF THE DRAMA IS STRONG ENOUGH IT CHANGES US AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE WORLD AND THEN WE ARE DIFFERENT IN A WAY THAT MAKES THE PAST VERY IMMEDIATE IN THE PRESENT SO WHAT THE PERSON THAT IS TRYING TO DO AND THERE'S BEEN A LOTS OF THOUGHT ABOUT THIS OVER THE YEARS IN THE FIELDS  TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS AND I THINK IN MANY WAYS DOING A GOOD JOB OF UNDERSTANDING THIS THAT THE QUUD UN QUOTE REPETITION COMPULSION IS TH THE DRIVE AND I DON'T MEAN DRIVE LIKE WERE SAY THATTHERE'S A PUSH INSIDE THE PERSON TO TRY AND MAKE THAT RIGHT IT WITH THE IDEA THAT IF THAT PERSON CAN BE IN THAT SITUATION AGAIN RIGHT AND I DON'T MEANING THE EXACT SITUATION WHEN SOME ONE RAISES A HAND TO THEM BUT THEY CAN NAVIGATE A RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA THE FIRST TIME SO DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE THAT WAS A VERY BAD IDEA SO 'M OING TO MAKE IT RIGHT ND AND I' OING O BE OQET AND I GON TO BEHOLE RIGHT BECAUSE THE PERSON IS DRIVEN BY FEAR AND MONABILITY IN THE SHAME OF THE TRAMA RIGHT SO THEN THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT RIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE THE LYMBIC SYSTEM DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE CLOCK OR THE CALENDER IF YOU CAN MAKE IT RIGHT NOW YOU MAKE IT RIGHT IN THE PAST RIGHT AS THAT SYSTEM DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE PASSAGE DRIVEN BY TRAMA SO THIN THE PERSONS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT TO TRYING TO CHOOSE THAT PERSON BEHAVE IN THE RELATIONSHIP THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS DIFFERENT BUT THEY'VE SELECTED FOR A DRAMATICALLY HIGH PRETEST PROBABILITY OF THE SAME THING HAPPENING AGAIN WHICH IS WHY YOU IF I COULD COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT SOME ONE HAS SAID TO ME OH YOU'RE NOT CANT HELP ME ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THER THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN HELP ME RIGHT MY LAST BUTFIVE RELATIONSHIPS WERE TOTALLY TERRIBLE LIKE I THERE'S NO WAY THERE'S NO HOPE PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT TO ME SO MONE HAS LAST THREE TH LAST FIVE LAST NINE AND I WILL SAY BACK IF YOU TELL ME SEVEN DIFFERENT STORIES OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH SEVEN PRETTY DIFFERENT PEOPLE SEVERAL DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS AS THEY EVOLVED IN THE SAME REALLY BAD OUTCOME I'LL AGREE WITH YOU BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME THAT AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S HOPE AND NO ONE HAS EVER TOLD ME SEVEN DIFFERENT STORIES AR I FEEL LIKE WHILE UGEOUS CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NO AND AGAN EVEN IF THERE WERE SEVEN I'M SAYING SANEH FOR EXAGGERATION RIGHT BUT THERE ARE BUT THEIR AREN'T RIGHT IS WHAT IS IT THE SAME THING SEVEN TIMES THAT'S WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THE PERSON IS REPEATING IT IF THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THE WHAT AND THE WHY WHIRE THEY SELECTING HOW WERE THEY SELECTING SOMEONE WHAT'S GOING ON IN SIDE OF THEM WE GO BACK TO THE STRUCTURE OF SELF THE FUNCTION OFSELF WE ADDRESS WHAT IS THERE THEN THAT ABSOLUTELY CAN CHANGE AND THEN WHAT WILL WE TALK ABOUT AS THAT PERSON THEN GOES OUT TO FIND ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP EVEN IF THEY SAID THEY NEVER NEVER NEVER WOULD AGAIN LIKE NEITHER MAKING THE DECISION TO GO OUT TIT IS A WHAT RELATIONSHIP WRE YOU LOOKING FOR YOUR SECOND YEU'RE THE FIRST ONE SEVEN TIMES NO HARM NO FOW BUT YOU CAN NAVIGATE THE SECOND BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THEY'RE COMING THROUGH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE INSTEAD OF DENEGRATING THEMSELVES IF YOU'RE WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME WHAT'S WONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE E I'M HERE IGHT EVEN THOUGH LIKE SOME BAD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO ME LOOK AT WHANE I CAN BRING MYSELF TO BEAR I CAN GO OUT THERE AND TRY AND FIND SOME ONE I CAN SEE WITH CLEAR VISION NOW THERE'S AGENCY THERE'S GRATITUDE AND THEN THAT PERSON CAN GO OUT AND FIND RELATIONSHIP NUMBER TOO ITS A REALLY GOOD ONE IN THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE ITS TVERY POWERFUL AND ALSO VERY EXTREME YOUR AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WERE SOME ONE IS YOU' SADLY GETTING HIT OR YOU KNOW SCREAMED AT YOU UM OFTENTIMES IT SEEMS PEOPLE LEND UP AN REPEATED UNSUCCESSFUL PEARINGS MEANING UNHAPPY PEARINGS OF AM IR SOMEBONE WHOS VERY STRONGLY ASSERT IF MAYBE WE WOULD SAY HOW HE STRONG AGGRESSIVE DRIVE A SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EVEN CALL THEM A NRSASSIST A THAT PHRASE IS THROWN AROUND A LOT THESE DAYS I MANARSES IVS GAS LIGHTING LIKE PROJECTION THESE PHRASE ARE THROWN ROUND ALL THE TIME I THINK WITH A FRANKLY VERY LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OR ROF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN UNLESS THEY'RE COMING FROM A A QUALIFIED CLINITION IS IT THE CASE THAT YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT PASSIVE OR AM SUBMISSIVE PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO NARSISSIS OR NARSES AS DRAWN TO SUBMISSIVE PEOPLE  THINK THESE QUESTIONS RING IN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S MINES IF I COULD CLAIFY SOMETHING THAT THINK I MAY BE COILD TO SET IN A CLEAR WAY YOU POINT IT OT THAT THE EXAMPLE I GAVE WAS IT WAS A VERY STRONG N AN EXTREME ONE I SO AS A PHYSICIAN I THINK I NATURALLY GRAVITATE TO THE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE THEY'RE E ONES THAT BRING THE GREAT ST RISK BUT WERE WE ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THOSE SETTINGS BUT BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT IN THOSE EXTREME SETTINGS BUT THAT EXTREME SERVES AS A MODEL FOR HOW THINGS THAT ARE LESS EXTREME CAN HAPPEN SO WHEN I THINK RIGHT WERTH SITTING HERE TALKING TO EVERY ONE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM AND MOST RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE NOT GOING WELL THANK GOODNESS ARE NOT GOING TO BE THAT EXTREME WITHE REPEATED PATTERNS ON CANG TO BE THAT EXTREME BUT IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO A PATTERN WHERE ONE PERSON REALLY IS SOOTOR MORE DEFERENTIAL THAN THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE TO THE OTHER THAN IS COMFORTABLE TO THEM AND THEYRE SEEKING SOME ONE ULTIMATELY WHO'S JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ASSERTED AND OU KNOW THAT'S NOT SOME DISASTER BUT IT CANNOT GO WELL OVER TIME WHERE THAT PERSON SLOWLY CAUSE OP SAY MORE AND MORE OF THEMSELVES AND AND THERE CAN BE THAT REPEATED PATTERN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY YET I WAS A PRETTY GOOD OR PRETTY EQUAL AT THE BEGINNING BUT THEN YOU KNOW I JUST ID LIKE LESS AND LESS TO SAY OR EVERYOR OUKNOW THEN MORE AND MORE LIKE I BECAME THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT SO IT'S NO LESS IMPORTANT WHEN IT'S LESS DRAMATIC RIGHT BECAUSE THE RELATINSHIPS OL GOES IN A WRONG WAY WHEN IT'S MORE DRAMATIC THEREIS MORE RISK OF COURSE BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE IN THE LESS DRAMATIC BUT BUT BUT SUPERIMPORTANT CATAGOAND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO POINT THAT TO POINT THAT OUT TO HOW MUCH OF WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT IS NESTED ON PEOPLE'S DEEP PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLE DESIRE TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T BELEAVE IMI CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE HEARD ABOUT OR OBSERVED RELATIONSHIPS THAT FROM THE OUTSIDE IT SEEMED REALLY UNHEALTHY BUT IT ALSO OCCURRED TO ME THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT IN SURE THAT THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T LEAVE SO I 'M NOT TELING ABOUT A PHYSICAL TRAPPING OF SOME ONE IN THE ENVIRONMENT I SHOULD ELLING ABOUT THE OPPOSITE I TIE ABOUT SOMEBODY GOING AGAINST THEIR BETTER JUDGMENT AND DOING THINGS FORW THE OTHER PERSON OR AGAINST THEMSELVES OR BOTH PERHAPS EVEN IN THE CONTECTS OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE HEALTHY FAMILY LIKE DOING EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OF A RAISING OF CHILDREN OR EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OF WORK A TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY SIMPLY TO ENSURE THAT THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T LEAVE RIGHT RIGHT HERE AGAIN WE CAN LOOK ACROSS THE SPECTRUM RI SO BEFORE THIS YOU TALK ABOUT RELATIONSIS THA CAN BE VERY UNHEALTHY LIKE A NARSICISTIC PERSON AND HOW CAN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS DEVELOP IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WE TOUCH ON THAT AN THE CONTEXTS OF THIS BECAUSE THAT SORT OF THE EXTREME EXAMPLE SO PEOPLE WHO ARE NARSICISTIC MEANING A NRSICISTIC CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND OW WE'RE GETTING INTO THE REALM OF SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NARSICISTIC ARE EXPLOITIVE IT THEIR BOTTOMLESS PIT OF NEED ARISING FROM VONABILITY AND YES THEY CAN BE HELPED AND SOME ONE OUT THERE THINKS I'M NARCICISTIC THAN NOT TRY TO BE NEGATIVE OR MEING YOU CAN GET HELP AND YOU CAN BE BETTER THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT YOU AND I ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO PEOPLE CAN CHANGE BUT BUT SOME ONE WHOSE COMING AT THE WORLD THROUGH AN ARCACISTIC CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS EXPLOITIVE OF THE OTHER AND THEN CAN SAY SURVEY A ROOM AND FIND THAT PERSON WHOSE AT DROMA SUCH AT THAT PERSONS CAN BE DESPERATE NOT TO LEAVE A RELATIONSHIP AND THEN THEY CAN EXPLOIT THAT PERSON AND OFTEN BEHAVE IN AWFUL WAYS AND THE OTHER PERSON WON'T LEAVE NOW I'M GIVING AN EXAMPLE IS NOT THE CASE THAT CASE THAT WAY EVERY O EVERY SINGLE TIME BUT THAT'S THE DOMINANT THAT'S HE DOMINANT PICTURE IF YOU HAVE ANARSICISTIC PERSON AND WHO IS AT PERSON MORE LIKELY TO PARE WITH AND THAN USENSE TIVE VONABILITY THE THE DESIRE FOR THE OTHER PERSON NOT TO LEAVE SO AND THAT PERSON WOULD HAVTAT THAN SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN THEMSELVES LIKE A POTENTIALLY INSTEAD OF A PATHOLOGICAL LEVEL OF NARCICISM A PATHOLOGICAL LEVEL OF DEPENDENCE FOR EXAMPLE SO WE'RE IN THE REALM THAN OF OF REAL PROBLEMS AND AGAIN REAL PROBLES CAN BE TREATED AND REAL PROBLEMS CAN BE IMPROVED THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CLINICAL CARE BUT IT CAN ALSO SERVE AS A MODEL FOR SEEING THE WAYS THAT ARE THAT ARE LESS DRAMATIC RIGHT SO SO THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO THROUGH THE DESIRE FOR THE OTHER PERSON NOT TO LEAVE AND WE COULD CALL THAT ATTACHMENT AN SECURITY RIGHT AND AND MAY BE IF WE LEAVE AWAY THE STEREO TIGPT VERSION OF IT RIGHT THE PERSON DOESN'T FEEL SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE OTHER PERSON RIGHT AND AND SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF THEM THEY'VE LEARNED THAT IF THEYARE MORE PLEASING RIGHT IF THEY GIVE UP LITTLE PART TO THEMSELVES THAT PERSON WON'T LEAVE RIGHT IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE THAT'S WHY THEIR MOTHER DIDN'T LEAVE THEIR FATHER WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT IT IT MIGHT BE THAT'S WHY THEIR FATHER LEFT THEIR MOTHER BECAUSE THER MOTHER WOULDN'T DO THAT RIGHT WHATEVER IT MAY BE OR IT MAY BE THEIR OWN PRIOR LIFE EXPERIENCE OR WHO KNOW SOMETHING THEY READ BUT FORGOT I MEAN USUALLY IT SOMETHING MORE SALING IT NOT ALWAYS BUT THEY'VE INTERNALIZE SOMETHING THAT LEADS TOO A COMPROMISE THESELF NOW AGAIN ALL THAT'S NOT WHAT ATTACHMENT AN SECURITY IS RIGHT ATTACHMENT AN SECURITY IS JUST FEELING SOME INSECURITY ABOUT THE ATTACHMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE I FEEL ATTACHMENT AN SECURITY ABOUT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING RIGHT I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF OF SUDDEN VERY PAINFUL LOSSES HAPPENING RIGHT SO I'VE ATTACHMENT AN SECURITY IN THE SENSE THAT A'M WORRIED RIGHT I GET AT IT ANXIOUS ABOUT PEOPLE GOING AWAY AND AND I CAN IN A WANT OVER CONTROL LIKE I BUT I RECOGNISES INSIDE MYSELF I TRY AND DO MY BEST THE SAY  I DON'T WANT THAT TO MAKE ME UNHEALTHY I WANT TO RECOGNIZE IT I WANT A FIND SOME HAPPY MEDIUM WHERE I HONOR THAT IN ME BUT DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY WITH IT TO THE POINT WHERE I TRYING OVER CONTROL AND THEN I PUSH MY RELATIONSHIPS AWAY RIGHT SO I SAY THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN THAT KIND OF ATTACHMENT IN SECURITY WHICH CAN INVOLVE OVER CONTROL RIGHT AND THE KIND OF ATTACHMENT N SECURITY THAT CAN INVOLVE COMPROMISE THESELFES SO AND WE WANT TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL LIKE ON O BE CAREFUL LIKE WHAT IS A TROMABOND AND WHAT IS IT MEAN WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL WHAT IS ATTACHMENT AN SECURITY A D WHAT DOES IT MEAN A CERTAIN KIND OF ATTACHMENT AND SECURITY CAN LEAD A PERSON TO MAKE PROGRESSIVE COMPROMISES OF SELF THAT ARE NOT GOOD AND HEALTHY FOR THEM I'M CURIOUS ABOUT SOME OF THESE UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS FROM THE OTHER SIDE MEANING FROM THE SIDE OF THE PERSON WHO IS LET'S HOPE NOT BUT IN SOME CASES EXPLOITED OR WHO'SE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OR IN THIS SYNARIO OF ANARCICISTIC PERSON OR AN ABUSIVE PERSON IS THE ONE WHO'S TAKING THE ABUSE OFTEN IT SEEMS THE VICTIM IN THAT SYNARIO WILL BE TRULY STOCK IN THAT SITUATION THEY CAN'T LEAVE FOR FINANCIAL REASONS OR KIDS OR O THEIR OWN INTERNAL WORKINGS THER SYCHOLOGICAL MACHINERY HAS THEM LOCKED IN TO THAT IN SOME WAY AND IT'S THAT LOCKED IN BY PSYCHOLOGICAL MACHINERY THAT I'M INTERESTED IN AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN BECAUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE WE JUST LOOK AT THAT SAY YOU KNOW WHY DOESN'T THE PERSON LEA WHIDON'T BE JUST LEAVE BUT CLEARLY THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SITUATION THAT QUOTEN QUOTE WORKS FOR THEM AND MY WORS FOR THEM I DON'T MEAN THAT IT'S ADAPTIVE CLEARLY IT'S MALADAPTIVE BUT THAT WORKS FOR THEM THE POSSIBILITY I RAISED EARLYER PERHAPS AS RELEVANT HERE OU MAYBE IT WORKS FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE NARCISIST GET SOME SORT OF INTERNAL REWARD FOR ENGAGING THIS KIND OF DYNAMIC AND THEREFORE WON'T LEAVE AND THE OTHER PERSON NOT LEAVING IS OF MORE VALUE TO THEM THAN FEELING SAFE EVENI SO IT'S A TRAINING ONE FORM OF SAFETY FOR ANOTHER OR PERHAPS THE THE VICTIM AS RECALLING THEM IN THIS SYNARIO IS SOMEBODY WHO YOU KNON'T FEELS A GREAT SENSE OF REWARD BY SERVING SOMEBODY MORE POWERFUL THAN THEM UT THIS RAISES ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING QUESTIONS PERHAPS ABOUT POWER DYNAMICS AS WELL WHICH I CERTAINLY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT BUT WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF THE INTERNAL WORKINGS OF SUCH A PERSON THAT RESIDE WITHIN THOSE BINS OF STRUCTURE OF SELF OR F UNCTION OF SELF THAT WOULD PUT SOME ONE INTO THAT SORT OF SITUATION AND LEAD THEM TO STAY IN THAT KIND OF SITUATION WELL ANY SITUATION LIKE THAT IF IT'S AS YOU SAY WORKING FOR A PERSON WHICH AT TIMES OU KNOW WE SEE THAT FROM THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE THEY THINGS CONTINUE TO GO ALONG IF THINS CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD BUT IT THAT ONLY WORKS FOR SOMEONE IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING THE EMPOWERMENT THAT WE WOULD WISH FOR ANY ONE IN EVERYONE TO HAVE SO WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE LEADS THAT PERSON TO FEEL A SENSE OF I AN INABILITY TO CHANGE OU KNOW WHETHER THEY CAN'T SEE THEIR WAY OUT OF IT OR THEY THEY KIND IT COULD BUT COULD NEVER NAVIGATE TO IT AND THAT THEE'S THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE IF THAT'S WORKING FOR SOMEONE RIGHT BEALS WE'RE TALKING BOUT SOMETPHING THAT'S EXEXPLOITIV RIGHT THAT'S ABUSIVE REGARDLESS OF HOWITS ABUSIVE AND I THINK I BELIEVE THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN THE CONTEXT OF BEING DEMORALIZED IT OR THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BEING SO DISEMPOWERED RIGHTING OF SOMEONE JUST CAN'T GO TEN FEET FROM HOME LIKE THEIR SITUATIONS OF OF OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNTS OF OPPRESSION RIGHT OF A PERSON WHERE WHERE THE PERSONGE IS CAN NOT CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY AND THAAND THEIR SITUATIONS WHERE WERE WE AS STEWARDS OF ALL OF US WEREL THE GOVERNMENT MAY INTERVENE FOR EXAMPLE IDEALLY RIGHT THAT SOMEONE WOULD COME IN O HELP THAT PERSON BUT BORRING THAT KIND OF OUTLIER A PERSON WOULD ONLY BE IN THAT SITUATION IN THE CONTEXT OF BEING DEMORALIZED AND THAT DEMORALIZATION WOULD COME FROM TO LOW A DRIVE FOR ASSERTION BEING PROACTIVE AGGRESSION THAT THAT DRIVE IT'S REALIZATION IS TO LOW AND IF WE GIVE PEOPLE THE UNDERSTANDING AND WE GIVE THEM THE HELP THE MEANS THEY DON'T HAVE TO STAY IN ABUSIVE SITUATIONS LIKE WE SEE THIS IN SITUATIONS WHERE OUR SOCIETY WILL INTERVENE OR OMEHOTE HELPFUL INTERVENE SOME PERSON OR ENTITY WILL INTERVENE AND HELP A PERSON HELP THAT PERSON TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF THEM THAT LEADS THEM TO FEEL THAT THINGS CAN'T BE BETTER THEY CAN'T DO BETTER ER THER THEY'RE NOT WORTH BETTER OR WHATEVER THAT MAY BE AND HELP THEM DEFINED THE EMPOWERMENT TO THEN NAVIGATE THEMSELVES OUT OF THE SITUATION AND AND HERE AGAIN I THINK IT'S NOT JUST AGENCY BUT IT'S AGENCY PLUS GRATITUDE INCLUDING GRATITUDE FOR HAVING A SELF THAT COULD LEAVE A SITUATION WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT NO WE TALK WHAT PEOPLE AS BEATEN DOWN YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S A WAY TO KIND OF CAPTURE LIKE WHAT I THINK THAT FEELS LIKE AND HOW MUCH SUFFERING THERE IS IN THOSE SITUATIONS TO TO TO BE IN THAT PLACE AND CANNOT HAVE THE AGENCY TO GET OUT OF IT THAN THE PERSON IS NOT FEELING A SENSE OF GRATITUDE FOR SELF RIGHT THEY FEEL SO BAD ABOUT SELF THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO BE GRATEFUL FOR I AND THERE IS SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR RIGHTIN WE COULD GO THROUGH ANY PERSON IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT AND WE COULD LIST WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THAT PERSON ADAPTEVE THINGS ABOUT THAT PERSON KIND THINGS ABOUT THAT PERSON DILIGENT THINGS THERE ARE THINGS LIKE THAT IN EVERY PERSON THAT IF THE PERSON CAN'T SEE THAT THEY CAN'T ATTACH TO THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THAND THEY STAY IN A SITUATION THAT IS REALLY DEFINED BY THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND THEREFORE THAT AGGRESSIVE ASSERTION PROACTIVE DRIVE BEING EXPRESSED AT SUCH A LOW LEVEL I CAN SEE HOW A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP COULD EXIST IN RELATIVE ISOLATION YOU'R NOT COMPLETE ISOLATION AND HERE AGAENT U'M REFERRING TO HER THINKING ABOUT  ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP GUT YOA A HEALTHY ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP COULD EXIST IN RELATIVE ISOLATION YOU KNOW IM A FEW FRIENDS OF SOME CONTACT WITH FAMILY MEMBERS OR IN GREAT C ONACTIVITY WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN NEIGHBORS ET CETERA AND STILL BE A REALLY GREAT ROMANTIC RELATIONI CAN ALSO SEE HOW THE SORTS OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE FOCASSING ON AT THIS MOMENT WHICH ARE THIS UNHEALTHY DYNAMICS ARE MADE FAR WORSE BY LACK OF CONACTIVITY TO OUTSIDERS IN FACT A PREVIOUS GUEST ON THIS PODCAST WAS DAVID BUS WHOS PROFESSOR OF EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY DOWN O THE RICTECTS US OUSTIN AND HE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF HIS RESEARCH INTO THE DARK TRYAD THESE ARE NARSASSISTIN MACCAVILIAND SOMETIMES ALSO SOCIOPATHIC INDIVIDUALS HOW THAT PLAYS OUT IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND M IT'S A TERRIBLE THING BUT IN AN IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND AM GIVEN THE UNFORTUNATE FREQUENCY THAT THAT OCCURS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I RE REMEMBER SO CLEARLY FROM THAT DISCUSSION WITH A DAVID BUS WAS THAT EVEN WHEN THERE ISN'T SOCIOPATH THE OR A STRONG DESIRE TO DESTROY THE OTHER THAT IN THESE SORTS OF RELATIONSHIPS THERE'S OFTEN AN ATTEMPT TO ISOLATE THE PERSON IM YOU KNOW FIRST BY ISOLAING THEM FROM THEIR FAMILY I'M ALSO FROM FRIENDS AND CO WORKERS BUT ALL WITH THE GOAL OF CONVINCING THAT PERSON THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD WANT THEM HAS A WAY TO MAKE THEM QUOTE ON QUOTE VOLUNTARILY STAY IN OTHER WORDS TO UNDERMINE THEIR THEIR SENSE OF SAFETY TO RAMP UP THEIR SENSE OF ANXIETY EXCEPT IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL IM AND NOW I AM REMEMBERING THAT NOW BECAUSE I MUN US WERE TALKING ABOUT WHY WOULDN'T SOMEBODY JUST LEAVE WHY WOULDN'T THEY JUST TAPT INTO THAT AGENCY AND GRATITUDE A IT'S CLEAR THAT THE THE OPPRESSOR IN THIS KIND OF RELATIONSHIP IM HAS A REAL INCENTIVE TO TRY AND UNDERMINE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE BECAUSE OF COURSE WITH THOSE THEY WOULD BE REVEALED FOR WHAT THEY ARE IN THE PERSON WOULD FEEL ENABLE TO LEAVE IM TAKING US BACK ONCE AGAIN TO THE CRITICAL NEED TO CULTIVATE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE NOT JUST IN UNHEALTHY BUT UNCERTAINLY IN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS I MAN I THINK THE THE PRINCIPLE HERE IS THAT DARKNESS ALWAYS FAVORS THE OPPRESSOR SO THE OPPRESSOR WISHES FOR DARKNESS SO YOU AN ISOLATE THAT PERSON RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT THINGS ARE BETTER FOR SOME ONE ELSE THEY REALIZE THINGS CAN BE BETTER IT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TOLD BY SOMEONE THAT THEY'RE WORTH WHILE OR THEYRE FUNNY OR THEIR PRETTY OR THEIR SMAR TO WHATEVER THE CASE THEN B THEY MAY TAKE THAT INSIDE IHT AND THEY MAY TAKE INSIDE OH EY MAYBE I AM KNO I'M HANDSOME IN SMART MAYBE OR THEY THEY URE THINKING ABOUT THAT THEIR VERY BASIC CONCEPTS THAT THAT A LOW PERSON TO ENTERTAIN NEW IM WASTE TO LOOK AT THEMSELVES IHT SO THE PERSON WHOSE OPPRESSING WANTS THAT PERSON TO LIVE IN DARKNESS THEY DON'T WANT THEN TH SEE THAT THERE CAN BE BETTER THEY DON'T WANT THEM TO BE DIRECTLY TOLD THAT THEY'R BETTER THAN HOW THINGS ARE AND THAT SAME DARKNESS ON THE OUTSIDE SAY THE LIGHTS ARE OUT AROUND THE RELATIONSHIP IS THE GOAL OF THE OPPRESSOR ON THE INSIDE AGAIN THE PRESSOR MAY KNOW THIS AND BE DOING IT CONSCIOUSLY BUT OFTEN THIS GETS PLAYED OUT AND UNCONSCIOUS WAYS LIKE THE CONSTANT DENEGRATION OF SOME ONE A PERSON ISN'T SAYING INSIDE GISHA'M TRYING TO REDUCE THEIR THER AGENCY THEIR AGGRESSIVE DRIVE REALLY DOWN TO ZERO RIGHT BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING SOMEWHERE INSIDE THERE'S A KNOWING OF THAT EVEN IF IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS KNOWING AND THAN WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT KIND OF ABUSE OVER TIME IS A LOWER AND LOWER AND LOWER AABILITY TO BRING ONES SELF TO BEAR LESS PROACTIVE AGGRESSIVE ASSERTIVE A LOWER SENSE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THAT THAT'S REALY THE DEFINITION OF BEING DEMORALIZED AND AND THAT KIND OF ABUSE IS ALWAYS PROMOTING DEMORALIZATION BECAUSE DEMORALIZATION IS THE DARKNESS ON THE INSIDE IHT JUST AS ENVY IS TOO IGHT DEMORALIZATION IS A FORM OF DARKNESS ON THE INSIDE ENVY IS NO LESS DARK ENVY MAY BE A LOT MORE ACTIVE RIGHT BUT  IN BOTH CASE IS THERE'S NO KNOWLEDGE THERE'S NO GROWTH THERE'S NO WISDOM THERE'S NO LEARNING I SO THERE THE STATES OF DARKNESS AND AND WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT'S WH SO TRAGIC TO THINK ABOUT AS YOU OFTEN CAN HAVE AN AN ABUSER AN OPPRESSOR WHO IS LIVING IN TOTAL DARKNESS INSIDE A LIVING THROUGH THE LENDS OF ENVY AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A PERSON WHO IS BEING OPPRESSED WHO IS BEING EXPLOITED WHO IS LIVING IN DARKNESS BUT THERE LIVING IN THE DARKNESS OF DEMORALIZATION AND NOUH TIT'S A VERY SAD THING TO SAY TO IMAGINE AND HAS BEEN A VERY VERY SAD THING TO SEE RIS IF YIF YOU DO CLINCAL SYCHIATRY  FOR LONG ENOUGH YOU SEE A LOT OF THIS AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY NEVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ERE OPPRESSING HABIT WITHIN THEM THE MAJORITY OF TIME TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND WE DO SEE THAT I TOOK CARE OF A MAN A LONG TIME AGO WHO HAD BEEN TERRIBLY ABUSIVE TO HIS FAMILY AND IS WAS ALWAYS UNCLEAR TO ME IT AD HAPPENED YEARS BEFORE THAT THAT HE JUST UNDERSTOOD AND GAN I NEVER UNDERSTOOD LIKE WHAT HAPPENED THAT THAT HE HE GOT IT AND THE MAN REALLY MADE CHANGE LIKE CAN YET I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS THAT MADE THAT MOTIVATION IM HE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF AND HE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT HOW HIS FATHER OPPRESSED AND TERRORIZED THE FAMILY AND HOW HE JUST DID IT WITH AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT IT WAS ROOTED IN HIS OWN FEAR OF VONABILITY AND HE'S GOING TO LOSE HIS FAMILY AND NOT BE A MAN ANY MORE UNLESS HE OPPRESSES THEM LIKE HE RECOGNIZED ALL OF IT IN HIM AND HE HAD CHANGED IT SO DRAMATICALLY HE'D REMOVED HIMSELF FROM THE FAMILY SYSTEM AND WHEN I GOT TO KNOW HIM IT WAS YEARS LATER AND HE WAS REINTEGRATING BACK IN TO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN SUCH PROLONGED CHANGE AND HE HAD COMMUNICATED TO THE FAMILY HEIS UNDERSTANDING OFSELF SO SO IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN SOMEONE WHO IS ABUSING OPPRESSING COMING THROUGH A NARSTACISTIC CHARACTER STRUCTURE THE THERE'S NO THERAPUTIC NITHALISM HERE RIGHT THINGS CAN CHANGE IN THINGS CAN CHANGE IN THE OPPRESSOR WHICH ISN'T EXCUSING THAT RIGHT THAT MEAN A PERSON WHOS DOING THINGS IS IS MORALLY CULPABLE RIHT THAT THEY OFTEN A CRIMINALLY LEGALLY CULPABLE SO THAT IS ALL TRUE JUST AS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE IS TRUE AND THEN THE PERSON WE THINK ABOUT MORE COMMONLY IN THE SITUATION OF COURSE IS HA PERSON WHOIS BEING OPPRESSED AND THERE CAN BE CHANGE THERE TOO BUT TA PROBLEM IS HOW HARD IT CAN BE THAT THE IMPACT OF THE ISOLATION RIGHT AND ALSO THE DEARTH OF RESOURCES TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE SENT ACTUAL TRUE STORY OF A WOMAN WHO I BELIEVED WITH ALL MY HEART COULD GET OUT OF THE SICKLIC ABUSE OF SITUATION SHE WAS IN IF SHE HAD A CARBORATOR A CARBORATOR RIGHT SHOULD CAR THE CARDIN FUNCTION SHE'D A PLACE TO GO RIGHT THAER OTHERS WOULDN'T KNOW THATHAT SHE WAS THERE AND THE PROBLEM WAS JUST FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS TO CHANGE THE CARBONABIS THAT THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO THERE'S NO RESOURCE AS AWEAS A SOCIETY DON'T HELP PEOPLE NOW IT MAY BE THAT SOME ONE HELP THAT WOMAN AND GOT HER CARBORATOR AND SHE DROVE AWAY RIGHT IT SHOWS HOW WE CAN BRING OURSELVES TO BEAR AS A SOCIETY TO OFFER PEOPLE HELP WHICH SOMETIMES IS LIKE THE LIFE LINE THE PERSON NEEDS AND ANYON MAY BE THAT PERSON YOU KNOW'T REALLY NEEDS A SAFE HOUSE OR SOMETHING VERY DRAMATIC OR THEY NEED A CARBORATOR TO GET AWAY FROM BEING TERRORIZE BUT A LOT OF TIMES IS JUST COMMUNITY SUPPORT STRUCTURES RIGHT GOOD STRUCTURES AROUND PEOPLE INCOMMUNICY COMMUNITIES THAT CAN OFFER THEM SUPPORT IN SITUATIONS THAT MAY BE LESS DRAMATIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERCONNECTION WHICH SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN FIND THROUGH SOCIAL VANUES OR THOH RELIGIOUSLY AFFILIATED VENUES BUT THE IDEA THAT COMMUNITIES SUPPORT SYSTEMS ON ALL LEVELS MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE HATTHAT'S HOW THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL RIGHT BEYOND THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT IS THE SOCIETY IT'S THE CULTURE RIGHT AND THAT'S HOW WE ON THAT NEXT LEVEL OF EMERGENCE BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS CAN FOSTER GOODNESS CAN FOSTER HEALTH IN EACH IN EVERY ONE OF US HOW DOES SOME OF THESE SAME DYNAMICS PLAY OUT IN NON ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS SO FOR INSTANCE IN THE WORK PLACE A I WAS WEANED IN ACADEMIC LABORATORIES SO WHAT'S MOST FAMILIAR TO ME OR GOSH UNFORTUNATELY NUMEROUS EXAMPLES WHERE PEOPLE WORKING IN LABORATORIES NOT THE SAME AS MINE CAUSE I'VEBEEN VERY FORTUNATE HAVE AMAZING A BENEVOLENT MENTORS QORKY AND A OUTRAGEOUS AT TIMES BUT A BENEVOLENT NONE THE LESS BUT OTHERS AROUND ME HAVE BEEN IN LABORATORIES WHERE FOR INSTANCE THE THE WORK LOAD WAS JUST RIDICULOUSLY HIGH LIKE THE DEMAND FAR EXCEEDED WHAT ANY PERSON COULD DO AND IF SOMEBODY HAD A GOD FORBID A COLD OR A CHILDREN LIKE IT WAS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD MEET THE STANDARD THERE AM OR A STRESS DYNAMICS INS A PRESSURE COOKER DYNAMICS THAT A MADE IT WHAT ANY ONE WOULD CALL A TOXIC ENVIRONMENT AH YOU SEE THIS ALSO IN LAWFIRMS YOU SEE IT IN COMPANIES YOU SEE IT IN FAMILIES YOU SEE IT IN A FRIENDSHIP CIRCLES RITE EM AND HOW MANY MOVIES ARE ABOUT AMTEENS A HE OPPRESSING ONE ANOTHER THROUGH BULLING AND RIDICULE AND AM AND PRACTICAL JOKES THAT ARE ANYTHING BUT FUNNY RIGHT THAT ARE DOWNRIGHT DESTRUCTIVE GET AND ON AND ON AND SO OFTEN THE VICTIMS IN THESE CASES IF IT'S NOT A HOLLYWOUD MOVY A FEEL AS IF THAT'S THEIR ONLY CHOICE BECAUSE A TO LEAVE IS TO ESSENTIALY HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS RIGHT IT'S NOT THAT THAT'S THE ONLY OPTION IS TO STAY IT'S THAT TO LEAVE AS ESSENTIALLY TO LEAVE SCIENCE AM BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER HAVE THE LOUDER VOICE THEY HAVE THE MAGAPHONE THEY WRITE THE LETTERS O RECOMMENDATION A THE LAW FERMS PEOPLE TALK A IN AS I UNIC SPHOOL THIS OUT IN A LONG FORM QUESTION I'M REALIZING I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE EXCEPTION LIKE AS LONG AS THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE INTERACTING AND PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THEIR INTERACTIONS AND PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER THIS SORT OF DYNAMIC IS GOING TO TAKE PLOCE ABSAT ANY TIME YOU HAVE A CLOSED SYSTEM WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY YOU JUST ROLLING THE DICE FOR THAT KIND OF OPPRESSION WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY THINK ABOUT THEORETICALLY WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED THERE RIGHT THERE SHOULD BE HIGHER ORDER ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT WHETHER IT'S IN A COMPANY OR UNIVERSITY OR WHEREVER IT MAY BE THERE SHOULD BE HIGHER ORDER ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS REASONABLE AND RATIONAL SO IT'S NOT THEN ACTING IN A TOP DOWN WAY THAT WOULD BE OVER CONTROLLING RIGHT TELLING EXACTLY WHAT YOU CANNOT CAN'T SAY OR WHAT YOU CANNO CAN'T DO AND IT SU AS IS IS TOO MUCH RIGIDITY THAT CAN BE ENACTED TOP DOWN BUT THAT THE PROBLEM RUNS BOTH WAYS IF THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY FROM THE BOTTOM UP THEN THAT PERSON IS JUST SIMPLY STOCK RIGHT WHY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WE'VE PUT INTO PLACE HAS FAILED RIGHT AND THIS IS WHERE WERE WERE TALKING NOW ABOUT NOT JUST INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIP TO TWO PEOPLE RELATIONSHIPS BUT NOW WE START TALKING ABOUT SYSTEMS OF PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS OF PEOPLE OR ANOTHER LEVEL OF EMERGENCE WITH WITH A PERSONALITY SO TO SPEAK AN ENVIRONMENT ALL THEIR OWN YOU CAN KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT EACH PERSON IN THE SYSTEM YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SYSTEM BUT WHAT YOU DO KNOW IS THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS NECESSARY I MEAN PROBABLY IF WE ADDED UP ALL THE EXAMPLES IN HISTORY NO WE WE'D HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THEM OVER A THOUSAND YEARS I MEAN HOW MANY EXAMPLES DO WE HAVE THAT CLOSE SYSTEMS WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY ARE JUST ROLLING THE DICE THEY BREED OPPRESSION THIS IS THIS IS TRUE AT I IAVE BEEN AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES I I IAVE NOT TRY TO IMPLICATE IS ANY ONE PLACE VERSES ANOTHER BUT I WAS PART OF A MEDICAL TREATMENT TEAM SO THIS IS A HIERARCHICAL MEDICAL TREATMENT TEAM OF O BE SEVEN PEOPLE WHO GEVER TAKE ONE PENDING UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE GOING ON I THE TR EATMENT TEAM THIS AS TRUE AND AND I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING THIS IN SOME EXAGGERATED MANNER WHERE SOMEBODY BRUSHED UP TOO CLOSE TO SOME ONE AND THEY SLIPPED NO HURTING SOME ONE ON THE TREATMENT TEAM ITOO DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HURT BY SOME ONE SENIOR SO SO THIS IS USITED MAJOR UNIVERSITY IN A CLINICAL SETTING RI IT IS NOT AGAIN THATSOP IS LIKE THAT'S THE BE ALL AN ENDALL BUT YOU THINK ABOUT THE ALLEGED A SOPHISTICATION OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SISTEM THE ALLEGED EMPOWERMENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SITUATION WHICH DID NOT PUT A STOP TO THAT SO WE NEED TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY THE ACCOUNTABILITY HAS TO BE REASONABLE IT DOESN'T MEAN OVER CONTROL BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN UNDER CONTROL EITHER AND IF THAT PERSON IS BEING OVERWORKED AS YOU DESCRIBED WITH NO WAY OF WINNING OR HARM DON A YOU KNOW ON A MEDICAL TEAM AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT THAT THAT PERSON CAN CHANGE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED THAT PERSON AND FAIL THEM DRAMATICALLY AND GUESS WHO SUFFERS EVERY ONE DOES RIGHT THAT PERSON SUPPERS I AND THE SCIENCE THAT'S BEING DONE OR THE MEDICAL CARE THAT'S BEING PROVIDED IS IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US ANY ONE COULD BE THE PATIENT WHO WHO IS BEING TAKEN CARE OF BY THE TEAM WHERE ONE PERSON IS HURTING A COUPLE OF THE OTHERS YOU THINK THAT MEDICAL CARES CAN BE OPTIMIZED  IS THE SCIENCE GNG TO BE OPTIMIZED THAT WERE UTILIZING TO TRY AND MAKE OUR OUR LIVES BETTER LIVE LONGER BE UN LESS PAIN NWHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS ENVY THAT PERSON WHO OPPRESSING OTHER PEOPLE IS DRIVEN BY ENVY WHETHER IT'S A NARSOCISTIC CHARACTER STRUCTURE THAT ACTS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH ENVY OR IT'S ENVY THAT IS IN THIS PERSON'S LIFE IN THIS WAY OR NOT NOT ANOTHER WAY IS IT MATTER RIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IS ENVY AND ENVY IS NOTHING BUT DESTRUCTIVE R THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS NOTHING BUT PRODUCTIVE ENVY IS NOTHING BUT DESTRUCTIVE COULD YOU REMIND FOR PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS MAY NOT HAVE HEARD EPISODES ONE IN TOO YET THAT ENVY IS I'M PERHAPS NOT JUST A DESIRE TO BE LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE THAT ENVY IN THE CONTEXTS THAT WERE DISCUSSING HERES IS SOMETHING IM QUITE POSSIBLY DIFFERENT NDTHERE'S A VARYING LAXICON WHICH LIHT IS IMPORTANT TO DEFINE IT CAUSE I THINK PEOPLE LEARN IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS I'VE HEARD IT TALKED ABOUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS SO SO TO DEFINE THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JEALOUSY AND ENVY CAND WE COULD CHOOSE DIFFERENT WORDS BUT THIS IS THE WAY I LEARNED IT THAT'S BEEN MOST IMPACTFUL WHERE JEALOUSY IS IS BENON RIHT IT'S THE IDEA THAT IF I SEE THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THEN I THINK OH IT MAYBE I COULD WORK HARDER AND GET THAT THING RIGHT OR IF I CAN'T HAVE THAT THING LIKE MAYBE IT'S A PERSON IS YOUNGER RIGHT OK I CAN'T MAKE MYSELF YOUNGER THEN I CAN THINK OQUE TYO THREET LENDS OF GRATITUDE WAS IS THAT THE ONLY THING ABOUT ME RIGHT I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT MYSELF RIGHT OTHER THAN MAYBE I COULD BE YOUNGER AND M IF IF YOU COME AT THAT THROUGH THE LENDS OF HEALTH IT'S LIKE IT'S OQUET RIGHT IT CAN SERVE TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO I TRY HARDER WORK HARDER TAKE A LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND BE MORE ACCEPTING OF WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THERE IS CIRCUMSTANCES IN LIFE AND AND WHAT KIND OF CONTROL THEY CAN A AN ACT IN WHAT KIND THEY CAN'T IT'S OKE IHT ENVY IS DIFFERENT I ENVY COMES AT THAT PROBLEM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT BRINGING DOWN THE OTHER PERSON RIGHT IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS BRINGING UP THI SELF THAT'S WHY ENVY IS DESTRUCTIVE SO SOME ONE WHO MIGHT SEE ANOTHER A PERSON AND THEY ENVY THEM THEIR YOUTH RIGHT THEY ENVY THEY WANT THAT AND THEY WANT TO BRING THAT PERSON DOWN RIGHT AUSE I CAN'T MAKE MYSELF YOUNGER BUT THN THEY BES I CAN'T MAKE THAT PERSON OLDER EITHER BUT THEY CAN DO OTHER THINGS TO THEM RIGHT THEY CAN SECUALLY HARASS THEM MAYBE THEY CAN MAKE TERRIBLE JOKES THAT ARE REALLY INSULTING AND HUMILIATING MAYBE RIGHT T RE ALL SORTS OF THINGS A PERSON CAN DO TO BRING DOWN SOME ONE ELSE IN BE AN ACTION OF ENVY IS DESTRUCTIVE AND AND I TRULY BELIEVE THIS THAT PEOPLE WHO WHO COME AT THE WORLD VERY STRONGLY THROUGH ENVY BY ENLARGE AN OUR CICISTIC CHARACTER STRUCTURE THIS IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION BUT THAT SMALL PERCENTAGE DOES MOST OF THE DAMAGE ON EARTH IH IT'S A STRONG THING TO SAY BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT O STUDYING POLITICAL SCIENCE AND THINKING ABOUT HISTORY AND LEARNING MEDICINE AND LEARNING ABOUT SA CHIETRY AND SOCIOLOGY AND REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT THE WORLD AND AND AND THINKING WHAT WHAT DRIVES A PERSON ON A MEDICAL TEAM WHO'S GOTEN TO BE A SENIOR PHYSICIAN TO PHYSICALLY HURT DOCTORS LOWER ON THE HIERARCHY ENVY HT THAT PRESON FEELS TERRIBLE ABOUT THEMSELVES IN IT IS BEING DESTRUCTIVE TO THOSE PEOPLE SAME THING THAT SAME THING IS AT WORK IN THE LAD THE SAME THING IS AT WORK WHEN PEOPLE SART WORS OF DESTRUCTION THAT JUST SIMPLY HARM OTHER PEOPLE AND WE CAN SEE NO OTHER SENSE OF IT THAT FROM THE INDIVIDUAL SETTING ALL THE WAY UP TO THE WORLD SETTING WE SEE THE DESTRUCTION OF ENVY AND WE ALSO SEE IT INSIDE OF US BECAUSE A PERSON WHOIS ENACTING ENVY IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM IS NEVER THERE'S NO CHANCE OF HAPPINESS THAT HENCE THE I HATHE IDEA OF A BOTTOMLESS PIT RIGHT WHATEVER YOU GET LET'S AY AN ENVIOUS PERSON WHO WANTS MORE MONEY I WANT HAVE MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY RIGHT I WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE LESS MONEY THAN ME RIGHT SO THAT TH THEY COME AT THE WORLD THROUGH THE LENDS OF GREED WHEN THEY GET MORE MONEY HOW LONG DOES THAT MAKE THEM HAPPY RIGHT THIS DOES IT MEAN MONEY IS BAD OR HAVING MONEY IS THAT IT JUST MEANS IF YOU'RE COMING AT THE WORLD THROUGH THE LENDS OF ENVY RIGHT IN THAT LENDS A SPECIFICALLY FOCUSSED ON MONEY THAN YOU WILL BE A GREEDY PERSON WHO IS NEVER SATISFIED EVEN IF YOU HAVE TEN TRILLIAN DOLLARS SO IT'S NEVER GOOD IT TAKES AWAY FROM THAT PERSON ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAPPINESS AND IF YOU SEE PEOPLE WOULD WORK WITH PEOPL WITH THE NARSACISTIC CHARACTER STRUCTURE THERE CAN BE A SENSE OF A VERY BRIEF HAPPINESS IN THE MOMENT II AM HAPPY BECAUSE I REALIZE I HAVE SOMETHING SOME ONE ELSE DOESN'NT I'M HAPPY BECAUSE I'M THINKING OF MYSELF AND EVEN THOUGH I FEEL VERY INSECURE AND VUNERABLE INSIDE I HAVE A WHOLE SET OF DEFENSE MECHANISMS THAT LET ME TURN THOSE TABLES ROUND AND AND THEN FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF IN A WAY THAT PLACES ME ABOVE OTHERS WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN THAT PERSON IT MAY BRING SOME VERY BRIEF GRATIFICATION IN THE MOMENT BUT THAT'S NOT HAPPINESS HENCE THE NEED FOR THE GRATIFICATION OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN NARSECISTIC PEOPLE ARE THE LEAST SECURE MOST DIFFIDENT PEOPLE ON EARTH THEY JUST HAVE A PHENOMENALLY HEALTHY DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE THAT COMES ABOUT IN ORDER TO TRY AND PROTECT THEM THAT LEADS THEM TO GO TO THE OPPOSITE SOME OF UTS CALLHD A REACTION FORMATION GOING TO THE VERY OPPOSITE DENIAL AVOIDINCE RATIONALIZATION PROJECTION VERY UNHEALTHY DEFENSIS THAT THEN LEADS THAT PERSON TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM ANY HELP WHILE THEY ARE FRANTICALLY TRYING TO GAIN SOME GOODNESS THAT MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD FOR SPUT SECOND AND THEN DISAPPEARS FOREVER HENCE THE TREMENDOUS PREDILECTION FOR DESTRUCTION HOW TO YOU AND HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT POWER DYNAMICS IN RELATIONSHIPS PERHAPS STARTING WITH ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS I'VE HEARD IT SAID BEFORE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS POWER DYNAMICS AND RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL KINDS I DON'T IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT BUT I'VE HEARD THAT AND I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THT'S PARTICULARLY SALIENT IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A HOMOSEXUAL OR HAD OR SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP THAT THERE'S ALWAYS TO SOME EXTENT OR ANOTHER ONE LEADER AND ONE FOLLOWER A THIS IS A A INTERESTING PERHAPS A A CONTROVERSIAL IDEA BUT I'VE HEARD IT ENOUGH TIMES THAT I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT SURE POWER DYNAMICS WAS VERY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO SOMETHING WE TEND TO BE SO OVER REDUCTIONS ABOUT ME THIS IDEA THING THAT THAT THERES ALWAYS A LEADER AND THERE'S ALWAYS A FOLLOWER EVERY SINGLE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT THAT'S TRUE ON BALANCE LIKE WHAT WE TEND TO BE SO REDUCTIONISTS AD THEN WHAT WE DO IS WE MISS THE REAL POWER DYNAMICS THAT ARE GOING ON JUST LIKE II HAD SAID IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE THI THINK MY MATHMINER HAS HELPED ME THE MOST FRLIKE ALL LIFE RIGHT I THINK A POWER DYNAMICS COURSE THAT I TOOK AS AN UNDERGRADUATE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE HAS HELPED ME THE MOST AS A PSYCHIATRIST TOOK IT LONG BEFORE MEDICAL SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT CLASS TAUGHT ME SO MUCH ABOUT POWER DYNAMICS I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT OVER POWER WHO HAS POWER OVER WHOM AND TELLS WHOM TO DO WHAT RIGHT BUT WHAT I LEARNED IS SO MUCH OF POWER DYNAMICS ARE COVER THEY'RE UNDER THE SURFACE FOR EXAMPLE TO THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT SAD SOMETHING THAT WAS CALLED AT THE TIME AT LEAST THE ISSUE OF THE NON ISSUE RIGHT WHERE THERE'S AN ISSUE BETWEAN TWO PEOPLE LIKE THIS PERSON NEVER TAKES OUT THE GARBERGS THAT PERSON ALWAYS TAKES OUT THE GARBERS THAT PERSON IS RESENTFUL ABOUT IT BOTH OF THEM KNOW BUT THE PERSON WHO ALWAYS DOES IT CAN'T SAY SO BECAUSE IF THEY SAY SO THE PERST PERSON WILL PUNISH THEM IN SOME OTHER WAY RIGHT BY NOT TAKING OUT THE GARBIS THAN THE PLACE SMELLS THAT PERSON GOES TO WORK AND THE PERSON IS AT HOME AS TO TAKE IT OUT RIGHT THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUE OF THE NON ISSUE OTHER EXAMPLES ARE WHERE SOME ONE IS LOOKING AND SMILING AND AND BEING REALLY NICE TO SOME ONE WHO THEY KNOW IS GENTO PHYSICALLY HARM THEM IF THEY BRING TO LIGHT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT HAPPY AND DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT PERSON RIGHT SO FROM THE DRAMATIC TO THE NONDRAMATIC UNSTATED POWER DYNAMICS ARE GOING ON ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THERE IN EVERY SINGLE RELATIONSHIP AND UNLESS THE PERSON IS IN RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME ONE ELSE UNDER BOTH COMATOS I GUS ONLY ONE OF THEM ASTED BE COME MITOS RIGHT THE'RE POWER DYNAMICS GOING ON BUT IT IT DOES IT MEAN THAT THEYRE UNHEALTHY RIGHT AUSE THE THERE ARE ALWAYS POWER DYNAMICS SO THEN WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR AND AN THERE LOT OF THINGS WE COULD LOOK FOR BUT WE COULD TALK ABOUT REALLY TOO PRIMARY THINGS ONE IS LOOK FOR THE NON OBVIOUS AND TOO IS THE GIVEN TAKE SO THE FIRST EVEN IN OUR OWN RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S INTERESTING HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAY TALK ABOUT THE POWER DYNAMICS IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS SAYING YOU'RE THE POWER DYNAMICS IN MY RELATIONSHIP BUT THEY'RE TELLING ME ABOUT THEM AND THEY'RE TELLING ME ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE OVER RIGHT NOW SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF THEM THEY KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T REALLY RAISE ISSUE A BEER SEE OR WILL BE SOME RETRIBUTION WHETHER IT'S SMALL OR LARGE OR THEY MIGHT EVEN KNOW EVERYTHING'S DOCEY AND THAT PERSON IS HAPPY BUT THEY KNOW I'M NOT GIVING THEM ROOM TO SAY THATHEY'RE NOT HAPPY AND THAT COULD JUST MEAN ENOUGH THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT HAPPY THEND IM I'LLCOME HOME A COUPLE HOURS LATE THE NEXT DAY AND THAT PERSONWILL FEEL SOME ATTACHMENT AND SECURITY BECAUSE OF THAD AND YOU KNOW THE'RE ALL SORTS OF WAYS THIS CAN PLAY OUT BUT SINCE SO MUCH OF POWER DYNAMICS ARE AR UNSTATED OR COVER KIND LIKE THE ICEBERG OF CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS AS AN ICEBERG ORE POWER DYNAMICS SO TO THINK ABOUT INCLUDING IN ONE'S OWN RELATIONSHIPS WHETHER IT'S A NEIGHBOR IT'S A FRIEND IT'S A WORK RELATINSHIP OR MOST CHARGED IT'S ROMANCE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON BETWEEN US WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON BETWEEN US I MIGHT NOT LOOKING TO TELL MYSELF LIES RIGHT I KNOW THAT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF IT BUT LET ME STOP AND THINK ABAUD IT AND PEOPLE IF YOU ASK PEOPLE TO STOP AND DO THAT THEY CAN SAY YET IT'S REALLY NOT OK OR YOU KNOW BECSE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THERE OR THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW THAT IT'S THERE AND AND THE FERIPY WORK IS TRYING TO GUIDE THEM TO THISIT IMMENSE POWER TOSPARITY MAYBE IN THER RELATIONSHIP WHEN THEY'RE PRESENTING KNOW EVERYTHING IS EQUAL TO GOOW SO GOOD SUPPORT OF RELATIONSHIP YOU'RE THAT ALLOT AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING BAD UNDER THE SURFACE BUT A LOT OF TIMES THERE IS AN EVEN SOMETHING MILDLY BAD IS NOT OQ AND CALLS PROBLEMS AND SOMETIMES THERE'SE SOMETHING VERY BAD SO LOOK FOR THE NON OBVIOUS AND THEN THE SECOND IS THAT GIVEN TAKE IS A IS A VERY GOOD SIGN OF HEALTH IS A VERY GOOD SIGN OF ELSO IF A PERSON A KIND OF S EE THAT THERE IS GIVEN TAKE AND IT MIGHT BE THAT SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS I COULD CHOOSES WHERE WE GOO TO DINNER CA NOW SOMETIMES ONE SOMETIMES THE OTHER DEPENDS WHO HAS A STRONGER FEELING OR IT MAY BE THAT PERSON ALWAYS TECIDES WILL BE GOO TO DINNER BUT THE OTHER PERSONS O CAY WITH IT RIGHT AND THAT PERSON ALWAYS DECIDES WHAT MOVE THEY WANT THE O THE OTHER PERSON RIGHT SO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S GIVEAN TAKE AND THEN IN PERIODS OF TIME WHERE WHERE ONE PERSON MAY BE IN A MORE DIFFICULT PLACE ONE PERSON HAS A SIG NIFICANT LOSS RIGHT OR AN INJURY OR IN ILLNESS THAN YOU SEE THAT THAT SHIPS A LITTLE BIT ONE PERSON IS GIVING MORE RIGHT BUT THEN ULTIMATELY THE IDEA IS THAT'S FROM THE OUTSIDE RIGHT IF ONE PERSON IS GIVING MORE TO THE OTHER THERE'S A GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT IN BOTH THE GIVING AND THE ACCEPTING RIGHT THAT LEADS THEM TO THEN BE STRONGER TOGETHER SO EVEN WHEN K PEOPLE SAY WELL THEY'RE IN BALANCES IN SOME WAY IF YOU JUST LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON DAY TO DAY BUT IN A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIGH GENERATIVE DRIVE THE PERIODS OF IN BALANCE STRENGTHEN THE RELATIONSHIP AR YOU SEE THUS WITH FRIENDS WHERE TO PEOPLE OF PRETTY EQUAL FRIENDSHIP AND AND THEN LIKE ONE PERSON AS SOMETHING DIFFICULT HAPPENS AND THE OTHER PERSON IS THERE FOR THEM WHAT'S TRUE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT THEY'R BETTER FRIENDS RIGHT AND IT'S ALSO WHY WE OFTEN WANT TO BE INTERCONNECTED EN WE'RE HEALTHY WHAT IS SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO BOTH OF THEM RIGHT IT'S GOOD TO BE INTERCONNECTED IN FRIENDS AND FAMILY CAN BE SUPPORTIVE TO US SO SO THE IDEA THAT GIVEN TAKE IS HEALTHY I THINK IS IS VERY CENTRAL SO JUST LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE AS OFTEN IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RELATIONSHIP MAY BE IS EARLY IN THE THERAPY OR JUST BEEN KIND OF OPAQUEOR I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT I'M LOOKING FOR IS THERE GIVEN TAKE BECAUSE ANOTHER TO THINK O KA MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THINGS OU'RE HEALTHY IF I SEE AND EMBALANCE WHETHER THE PERSON KNOWS IT OR NOT O'M THINKING MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT'S UNHEALTHY AND THEN THEY'RE JUST CLUES ALONG THE PATHWAY OF OF OF MY EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THE NON OBVIOUS PIECE IS REALLY ENTRIGING AS IS THE GIVEN TAKE AND I REALLY PRECIATE THE BROUGHT UP THE GIVEN TAKE BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY CONCRETE PLACE WE CAN ALL LOOK AND ASK OURSELVES YOU KNOW EVEN IF PEOPLE AREN'T HIN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE GIVEN TAKEN A GIVEN FRIENDSHIP UM AND AS YOU MENTION EARLIER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SCRIPTET ONE FOR ONE ONE FOR ONE EM MAYBE BALANCES OUT OVER TIME OR MAYBE IT DOESN'T I MEAN I HAD FRIENDSHIPS THAT IF A LASTED MANY DECADES EVEN WHERE I CAN HONESTLY SAY I'M ALWAYS THE PERSON TO REACH OUT TO THE OTHER PERSON BUT WHEN THEY CANNECT THEY CAN ACT WITH SUCH A DEPTH OF ATTENTION THAT I DON'T FEEL ANY DEPRIVATION WHATSOEVER IN FACT I DON'T THINK OF EVER CONSIDERED THAT I'M THE PERSON THAT ALWAYS REACHES OUT UNTIL TO DAY AS O DOESN'T BOTHER ME WHATSOEVER I FEEL INFINITELY REWARDED IN THE RELATIONSHIP LIKE ITS GENERATIVE I FEELS GENERATIVE IT DOESN'T HAUGH TO BE EQUAL HOWEVER ONE WANTS A DEFIND EQUAL BUT IT HAS TO BE MUTUAL YOU'RE GETTING IN YOUR FEELING GOODNESS FROM HE RELATIONSHIP SO IS THE OTHER PERSON LO ET THAT'S GOOD THAT'S COMING FROM THAT HIGH GENERATIVE PLACE AND WHEN WE REALLY LETS TAT WE PUSH THAT CONCEPT FORWARD TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE LIVING NOT SOME PIE IN THE SKY RIGHT BUT AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS FERS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS IS VERY STRONGLY EXPRESS AND THE OTHER DRIVES ARE SUBSERVING TO GENERATIVE DRIVE THEN WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE WE REALLY SEE IT IS TRUE THAT IT IS BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE I SEE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING NOW OF COURSE IT FEELS GREAT TO RECEIVE BUT IT FEELS BETTER TO GIVE BECAUSE THERE'S A GOODNESS IN THI SELF IN THE GIVING AND I REMEMBER SEEING THIS IS A CHILD AND BEING TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND IT BUT HAS A LITTLE KID I LIKED GETTING THINGS R AND AS A LITTLE KID I LIKED GETTING THINGS MORE THAN I LIKED GIVING LIKE THAT'S OL KAY WHEN YOURE LITTLE KID BUT WHAT I DID OBSERVE IS THAT MY MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER WHO IS VERY SWEET AND LOVING AND AND CARING SHE LOVED GIVING I YOU GIVE HER PRESENTS AND WE DID AND SHE LIKES SHE REALLY LIKE GETTING PRESENTS SHE LOVED GIVING IGT THERE'S AN EXCESS OF GOODNESS AND THEN AS I GOT OLDER ND I LEARNED MORE LIKE WHO SHE HAD BEEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND HOW SHE HAD BEEN TO PEOPLE AND AND I COULD SEE AND NOW THROUGH THE LENS THAT THERE WAS SUCH GOODNESS IN HER I THINK SHE'S EAL FOR ME SHE IS THE SHINING MODEL OF GOODNESS THAT I INTERNALIZE AS I ASPIRE TO BE BETTER SO THEN I THINK I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT I I AM MORE GENERATIVE AS I TRY AND THINK MORE ABOUT GIVING THAN RECEIVING IT'S I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY I'M SOME NOBLE PERSON OR ON BEING ASETIC I'M THINK THAT'S A GOOD WAY FOR US ALL TO FEEL RIGHT WHERE SOME ONE A VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL PERSON THAT THAT I A CONSULTR IS IN MY LIFE RIGHT WHOS WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW HE ALWAYS MAKES INSIDE OF HIMSELF THE BEST UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN HIM AND ANOTHER PERSON WHETHER IT'S A VERY BIG FINANCIAL DEAR ITS ABOUT POWER OR IT'S PERSONAL AND THEN GIVES A LITTLE BIT ALWAYS WHERE'VE WE ENDIT UP LET ME GIVE A LITTLE BIT RIGHT AND AND THERE'S A PERSON IS VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL VE ARY VERY HAPPY RIGHT BUT YET I WOULD ARGUE THE GOODNESS IN HIM IS WHY HE'S SUCCESSFUL AND HAPPY IS NOT THAT HE'S SUCCESSFUL AND THEREFORE HE'S HAPPY RIGHT IT'S WHAT'S INSIDEED HIM THAT FOLSTERS BOTH OF THOSE GOOD THINGS AND HE COULD BE JUST AS HAPPY WITHOUT THAT THE BIG SUCCESS MAY BE WOULDN'T MAYBE HE WASN'T A MINDED TO DO THAT AND AND HE GROWS A NICE GARDEN HE COULD BE EQUALLY HAPPY BUT THE POINT IS THE GOODNESS IMSELF TO TO TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT DOING THAT I FEEL BETTER ABOUT GIVING THAT THAN I WOULD HAVE AT RECEIVING THAT THAT'S PRETTY STARK RIGHT SOMETHING GIVEN TO THE OTHER THAT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN RIGHT NOW AND WERE IN MAYBE A NEGOTIATION TO GIVE IT FEELS BETTER THAN TO HAVE IT I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL WHO ARE NOT GIVERS WHO ARE TAKERS I DO THINK THOSE EXAMPLES OF TAKERS OF SOM CALLING THEM A GRABLE LOT OF ATTENTION BUT I KNOW AT LEAST WITHINSCIENCE AND THE OTHER DOMAINS OF LIFE I'VE BEEN AND THAT THERE ARE FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO GIVERS IM EVEN TO A GREAT EXTENT AND OF COURSE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE GIVING TO THE POINT OF UM AN INABILITY TO GIVE FURTHER OR TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THE GIVING IS PART OF TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES BUT IT'S PART OF THIS GENERAT OF CYCHL IT'S IT'S NOT ONE THING IT'S NOT A TIT FOR TAT IT'S IT'S IT'S PART OF SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD MAKES OTHERS FEEL GOOD IM IT'S IT SORT OF ANTI TRANSACTIONAL AND AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SELF AND INTER RELATIONS BETWEENSELVES IN THESE DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP CONTACTS TO DAY THIT'S WORD TRANSACTIONAL KEEPS COMING TO MIND IM AND WHAT I'M SO WARE OF AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHAT HEALTHY SELVES AND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS LOOK LIKE IS THAT IT RUNS COUNTER IT TO PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT I'VE HEARD IND THAT WE HEAR IN THE WORLD ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP TO SELF MEANING IT'S NOT TRANSACTIONAL IT'S REALLY ABOUT A CYCHL I WOR USING THIS WORD GENERATIVE OVER AND OVER AND A UM IN IT'S SPECIFIC CONTACTS TO DAY SO I DO'T WANT TIT ROB THAT  WORD FOR AFOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE BUT I'M IMAGINING A SORT OF UPWARD SPIRAL IM IN MY MIND OR PERHAPS ONLY IS THAT'S REALLY LIKE THE AA CIRCLE OF LIFE THAT JUST KEEPS GROWING BIGGER AND BIGGER D BIGGER IM MAY WE COULD TALK LO BIT ABOUT THIS NOTION OF RELATIONSHIPS BEING TRANSACTIONAL  MITES SUCH A LOADED WORD IM BUT I'VE A CLOSE FRIEND WHO'S MARRIED WITH MORE THAN A FEW CHILDREN WHO YOU DON'T TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY IM YOU KNOW I REALIZE THAT IT'S ALL KIND OF TRANSACTIONAL LIKE THEY'RE EXTRACTING FROM ME AND I'M EXTRACTING FROM THEM AND IT'S BENEVOLENT CAUSE IT'S ALL GOOD AND AND I I THOUGHT I THIS IS REALLY THIS IS REALLY DREADFUL YOU KNOW LIKE TH A NO ONE WANTS TO THINK THAT THE CLOSEST RELATIONSHIPS IN THEIR LIVES ARE TRANSACTIONAL AND HE WAS COMING TO THAT CONCLUSION I I DISAGREED WITH THEM AND I DON'T KNO WHERE THAT ALL SETS FOR HIM RIGHT NOW BUT MAY WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT THE TRANSACTIONAL VERSES NONTRANSACTIONAL ASPECTS OF RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE UM WE ALL WANT THINGS THAT'S PERFECTLY HEALTHY I BELIEVE UM WE ALL EXPERIENCE DISAPPOINTMENT AND PLEASURE AND RELIEF AND U SOMETIMES MADE YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT PLEASURE RELIEF ET CETERA BUT WHAT IS THE ROLL OF TRANSACTION IN RELATIONSHIPS AND H T YOU KNOW HOW TO PSYCHIETRY HOW TO YOU AND HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THAT OH WE OFTEN GET CONFUSED BECAUSE THERE ARE TRANSACTIONS IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY RELATIONSHIP IS TRANSACTIONAL IGHT SO IF WE THINK ABOUT WHAT TRANSACTIONS ARE WE CAN THINK OF THE KIND OF THE STERIO TYPICAL WAY SO IT CAN ALSO BE IKE HERE'S THE TRANSACTION I'LL DO THE DISHES AND YOU WASH THE CLOTHES RIT OR FORINSENS I'LL MAKE THE MONEY AND THE OTHER PERSON WILL RACE THE CHILDREN RIGHT RIGHT SO SO THERE ARE TRANSACTIONS RIGHT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE BE ALL AN END ALL OF IT ARE SOT OF HARD HEARTED CALCULATED TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS ALSO OCCUR IN LESS OBVIOUS BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT WAYS IGHT SO ANOTHER WAY THAT TRANSACTIONS OCCUR IS SO RIGHT NOW I'M PUTTING SOMETHING OUT THERE RIGHT SOME SAYING SOMETHING IGHT AN THEN AT A POINT I STOP AND I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO PUT SOMETHING OUT THERE THEN I TAKE IN WHAT YOU SAID AND WE'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT IN THAT SENSE IS TRANSACTIONAL I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO GIVE ME SOMETHING I TAKE IT IN I PROCESS THAT I GIVE SOMETHING BACK OUT TO YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE BE ALL AN END ALL OF IT SO THERE ARE TRANSACTIONS WHETHER IT'S THE YOU KNOW WHOSE CAN WASH EDISHES WHOS GOING TO DO THE CLOTHE OR IT'S WHAT O I PUT OUT THERE THAT YOU TAKE IN WHAT YOU PUT OUT THERE THAT I TAKE IN THAT THERE IS SOMETHING GREATER THAN SOMETHING BEYOND THE TRANSACTIONAL AND THERE IS SOME CONTROVERSY TO THIS A THOUGHT THAT THAT THAT THAT THERE REALLY ARE HISORICAL THOUGHT IN THE FIELD THAT THERE ARE JUST AGGRESSIVE AND PLEASURE DRIVES IN US AND THAT EVERYTHING IS TRANSACTIONAL NOW AGAIN WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A WAY OF DISPROVING THAT I MEANERS NOT CAN BE SOME EQUATION THAT DISPROVES THAT BUT I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY DISPROVEN BY HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND THERE'S SO MANY AND I COULD UNA WE COULD WE COULD TALK ABOUT IN INFANT NUMBER OF RESOURCES TO CONSIDER THIS BUT JUST IMAGINE THE WRITINGS OF VICTED FRANKIL AND THAT AND THE WRITINGS AND THE THEORIES AROUND HUMAN INTERACTIONS AND AND PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES THAT HAVE COME OF IT TO THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS JUST TRANSACTIONAL IT'S A DENIAL OF THE HUMANNESS IN ALL OF US THAT I THINK HE JUST BROUGHT TO THE FOR SO STRONGLY BUT AGAIN THERE COULD BE NEARLY INFINITE INFINITE RESOURCES THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY THAT SAY THET WERE NOT ENTIRELY TRANSACTIONAL IT'S NOT JUST AGGRESSION AND PLEASURE BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MORE GOING ON HERE THERE'S LEARNING THAT FEELS GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF LEARNING THERE'S KINDNESS THAT FEELS GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF KINDNESS THERE'S GIVING THAT FEELS GOOD BECAUSE GIVING FEELS GOOD THIS IS GOING ON IN US IT'S GOING ON WHEN WE'RE LIKE LOVING CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE OR LOVING ANIMALS THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF US THAT'S NOT JUST TRANSACTIONAL AND THAT'S WHY GT II THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IS IF IT'S TRUTH IT SHOULD ALL HANG TOGETHER RIGHT HE MUST ALL HANG TOGETHER AND AN THIS IS WHY THERE'S AN UST RIGHT OVER TOP OF EACH INDIVIDUAL THAT'S IN RELATIONSHIP RIGHT THIS IS WHY YOU CAN KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME YOU CN KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU AND YOU CAN KNOW NOTHING ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP RIGHT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT RIGHT AND IF IT WERE ALL JUST TRANSACTIONAL THERE WOULD BE NOTHING DIFFERENT RIGHT AND I THINK OUR EXPERIENCE AS HUMAN BEINGS RIGHT I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE BECAUSE I JUST KNOW THAT I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL SELFISH ABOUT THINGS IT RIGHT LIKE MAYBE SOMETIMES I DO AND I DO SOMETHING NICE CAUSE IT W'LL MAKE ME LOOKR LIKE OOK IT WE'RE ALL HUMAN RIGHT BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOOD EELING FROM OTHERS TOWARDS ME AT TIMES THAT'S JUST ABOUT THE GOOD FEELING I KNOW THAT THERE'S THAT FROM ME TOWARDS OTHERS SO THAT T OLLS US YES THERE IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST THE I THERE IS THE WE OF DIADS RIGHT OF RELATIONSHIPS NNO MATTER WHETHER THERE WORK FAMILY FRIENDSHIP RELATIONSHIP AND THEN THERE THE LEVELS BEYOND THAT THAT ARE LARGER WE'S RIGHT THE WE OF GROUPS SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IT CAN BE THE CASE THAT ONE PERSON MAKES THE MAJORITY OR ALL THE INCOME FOR FAMILY THE OTHER PERSON RAISE THACHILDREN TAKES CARE OF THE MAJORITY THE HOME AND OF COURSE THERE IS A TRANSACTION THERE A SET OF TRANSACTIONS BUT THAT IT'S IN SERVICE TO SOMETHING LARGER THAT REALLY ISN'T TRANSACTIONAL I'M AT JUST FEELING YOUR WORDS HERE BUT UM IF I WERE TO EXPAND ON THAT IT JUST TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NONTRANSACTIONAL THING THAT EMERGES FROM THAT IS A GENERATIVE BECAUSE IT'S A FAMILY RIGHT IT'S A FAMILY THAT EVERY ONE MIGHT EXTRACT GROWTH AND PLEASURE AND MEANING FROM OM AND JUST BECAUSE THE ROLES ARE DIVIDED AS SUCH IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS DEFINED AS TRANSACTIONAL IN IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S UN LESS THAN IT COULD BE RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT IF YOU IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY BEING TRANSACTED SO SAY ONE PERSON IS OUT IN THE WORLD AND IS MAKING AN INCOME THE OTHER PERSON IS A TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY ND TAKING CARE OF THE HOME WHAT'S BEING TRANSACTED WELL THE PERSON WHO'S  MAKING THE MONEY IS SHARING THE MONEY RIGHT IS IN THAT SENSE TRANSACTING SOME OF THE MONEY TO THE OTHER PERSON LIKE YOU GET TO HAVE SOME OF IT TOO GOUT HAVE SOME OF THE BENEFIT FROM ITAND THE PERSON WHO IS AT HOME WHO'S TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY IN THE HOME SENT YOU GET TO HAVE SOME OF THAT TOO RIGHT YOU GET TO COME  THE CHILDREN ARE TAKING CARE OF RIGHT THE HOME IS TAKING CARE F SO BOTH ARE TRANSACTINGS SOMETHING TO THE OTHER RIGHT EMING THAT'S TRUTH OF IT RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON THERE HON PERSON GETTING BENEFIT OF MONEY THEY DIDNT EARN THE OTHER PERSONS GETTING BENEFITS HAVE CHILD CURE THEY DIDN'T DO OR PAY FOR RIGHT I'S A HAING FOR CHILD CARE THERS SHARING RESOURCES RIGHT SO YES THAT'S UE BUT IS THAT IT I ARE THESE TWO ROBOTS IGHT ONE IS THE MONEY MAKING ROBOT AN THE OTHER IS THE CHILD CURE ROBAT LIKE THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT THATTHE WAY WE WANT TO INVISION THAT IF WE HAVE TWO HEALTHY PEOPLE WITH GENERATIVE DRIVES IS THEY LOVE ONE ANOTHER THEY'RE CREATING SOMETHING BETTER THAN THEY COULD CREATE ON THEIR OWN IN FACT THEY'VE CREATED CHILDREN RIGHT THEY'VE CREATED A HOME TOGETHER AND THEY'R NURTURING THAT FAMILY TOGETHER THAT IS GENERATIVE AND BECAUSE IT'S GENERATIVE IT CAN ALSO BE FLEXIBLE SO LET'S SAY THE PERSON WHO'S AT HOME TI NEED TO DO SOME THINGS OUTSIDE THE HOUSE RIGHT ER LET'S SAY THE PERSON WHO'S OUT WORKING THINKS  AFELL OVERWHELMED AND I LECT TO SWITCH TO A BETTER JOB THAT JUBS HALF TIME I BYT ONE TO BE I CAN BEHALF IN THE HOUSE RIGHT LIKE THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME TOGETHER RIGHT IN THE SAME WAY WE TALK ABOUT THE TWO AND AN AID ON THE SEX DRIVE OR SEXUALITY SCALE WHERE PEOPLE THEN CAN FIND COMPROMISES RIGHT AND IF ONE REALLY WANTS TO STAY OUT OF THE HOME ALL THE TIME BUT THE PERSON IN THE HOME WANTS TO LEAVE THE HOME WILL THEY FIND A WAY THAT THAT WORKS RIGHT BECAUSE THEYR CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER THAT THE GENERATIVE SPIRIT THAT IS IN THEM INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A COUPLE LET'S THEM NURTURE THAT AND ONE ISN'T INTERESTED IN OPPRESSING THE OTHER I'M NO CAND LEVE MY JOB YOU STAY AT HOME OR I'M STAYING AT HOME YOU STAY OUT THERE LIKE LET'S LET'S THINK ABOUT THINGS LHET'S LET'S COMMUNICATE RIGHT THAT'S HOW THE GENEATIVE DRIVE NOT ONLY I MAKES THAT AWSOM RIGHT LIKE THE FIVE ISN'T THE COMPROMISED POSITION BETWEEN THE EIGHT AND THE TWO THE FIVE IS ASOM RIGHT HERE THE TRANSACTIONAL ASPECTS ARE AWSOM BECAUSE OF THE GENERATIVE ASPECTS OF WHAT COMES OF IT FAR MORE THEN EITHER OF THOSE PEOPLE COULD MAKE ON THEIR OWN I MEAN WOMENT SAY IS NOT SO OBVIOUS MAY BE ONE MAKES EX AMOUNTED DOLLARS EACH COULD MAKE HALF ACTS THAT'S NAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEITHER OF THEM CAN CREATE THAT FAMILY ON THEIR OWN IT SEEMS THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RELIES ON YET T THE HALL MARKS THE THAT WE ALWAYS HEARR MAKE UP GOOD RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL KINDS ROMANTIC AND OTHERWISE LIKE THINGS ALIKE COMMUNICATION LISTENING GENEROSITY WE ALL THE STUFF THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BRING TO RELATIONSHIP AND HOPULLY ARE GETTING FROM RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT IF WE'RE NOT THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY REQUEST FROM OTHERS AN IN IIN A POLITE WAYS CAN I IT CONNECT NESS I'VE ONE WORD FOR THAT KINDERGARTEN RIGHT THINK ABOUT THAT WE LEARN THAT IN KINDEGARTEN WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS SO SIMPLE RIGHT THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HIGH UP ON THE THIS WHAT THE GUISEERS PUSHING UP IS HIGH UP FROM THE TWO PILLARS RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING BAT IS SIMPLE GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT GIVING RATHER THAN TAKING RIGHT BEINKIND TO OTHERS LETTING THINGS GO FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF EVEN IF YOU FALL DOWN RIGHT WE LEARN THIS IN KINDEGARD S WE MUST SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF US REALLY VALUE IT IGHT BUT THEN WE LET IT GO WE MAKE THINGS OVERLY COMPLEX AND O THIS THIS IDEA THAT IN MANY WAYS WE SHOULD GO BACK TO KNDERGARTEN RIGHT BCAUSE THERE'S A PURITY THERE RIGHT CHILDREN IN AN AGE WHERE YOU KNOW THEY CAN LEARN THAT WE BRING A NICE KIND OF LEARNING TO THEM AND INURTURING TO THEM AND WE CAN BRING IT TO OURSELVES TOO SO THAT WE SIMPLIFY THAT WHICH IS BECOME OVERLY COMPLEX RIGHT WE SIMPLIFY BECAUSE TROMA MAKES COMPLEXITY HAVEN'T JUST MAKE ONE'S WAY IN THE WORLD IT IT IS COMPLICATED RIGHT SO THINGS IT MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED AND WE LOSE THE SIMPLE ROOTS OF GOODNESS OR THE GOODNESS OF SIMPLICITY RIGHT AND WE CAN COME BACK TO THAT SY I COULDN'T RESIST WHEN YEU SAID OH THESE ARE K SIMPLE BARE THESE BASIC THINGS RIGHT RHT THAT'S THE POINT OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND THE GENERATIVE JI THAT'S WHERE THEY LIVE IN SIMPLICITY I'M GLAD YOU MENTIOND KINDERGARDEN IT BROUGHT ME BACK TO AM IMAGES OF KINDERGARDEN WERE YEAS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER NOW THER ALL THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF A GREAT GENERATIVE ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW ADULTS WHO REALLY CARED ABOUT US FORTUNATELY THEY WERE AM SNACKTIME WITH ORANGES OF NURSEAT FOOD RI WAS NAPTIME IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THESE THINGS ARE ALL THINGS THAT I'M EXERCISE EXPLOR ACIANY PIG HOME ON THE WEEK ENDS  THIS GUINEA PIG I THINK THEY ACUALLY I THINK THE WRE SEVERAL GUINEA PIGS BUT THEY KEPTRYING TO CONVENCEUS ALL THE SAME GUINEA AH BECAUSE THEY WOULD ALLOW ONE FAMILY TO TAKE HOME THE GUINEA PIGEACH WE CANN SOMETIMES I THINK IT DIDN'T WORK OUT QUITE SO WELL BUT ANYWAY THAT THE GUINEA PIG WAS A PERVASIVE FEATURES YOU LEARNG TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS AND IN ALL SERIOUSNESS NOW THAT I STEP BACK FROM IT THERE'S NOTHING MORE GENERATIVE IT SEEMS THEN A KINDER GARDEN CLASSROOM IN MASN'T OR WE SHOULD SAY A HEALTHY KINDERGARDEN CLASS FROM ENVIRONMENT IT'S ALL ABOUT SUPPORT OF OTHERS AND UM BUT IF WE GO TO THE PILLARS A THE STRUCTURE OF SELF ON THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND SURELY THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AT HOME TOO BUT THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT SALIENT IT'S LEARNING A MESSAGES OF SELF U YOU KNOW SELF CONFIDENCE LIKE IN STILLING THOSE IT'S BEHAVIORS THAT ARE BBASED ON STRIVINGS AND HOPEFULNESS TIT'S ALL THE GOOD THINGS YES ALL THE GOOD THINGS AND SO  YOU KNOW AS I WAS THINKING ABOUT COMMUNICATION AND ALL THESE GOOD THINGS THAT CLEARLY A GUINTERGARDEN IS A WONDERFUL TEMPLET FOR IN ALL SERIOUSNESS II THING IS AMAZING TEMPLET I'M THING ABOUT WHAT GETS IN THE WAY AND OF COURSE TRAMA CAN GET IN THE WAY UM AND WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT MORE  BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF ASKING FOR WHAT WE WANT OF HEARING REQUESTS OF US IN THE WAY THAT IS GOING TO BRING ABOUT THE MOST GENERATIVE GOODNESS IS ANXIETY IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW YOU TIRED FROM A LONG DAY AND SO ONE MENTIONS LIKE YO WEP WE HAVE TO TAKE THE TRASH OUT YOU LIKE LIKE I WAS AT WORK ALL DAY LIKE YOU KNOW THEN THAT KIND OF THING OR UM EARLIER TALKING BOUT THE ISSUE OF THE NON ISSUE TRMS OF POWERDYNAMICS UM YOU KNOW THAT WELL LET'S JUS SAY I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE BEFORE IN RELATIONSHIP OF FEELING LIKE IF I MAKE A REQUEST OR I HAVE A CONTOCOK COMPLAINT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER PERSON IS GOING TO BE SO UPSET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T DO SOMETHING WELL THAT'S TO ME THREE DAYS OF JUST THE DIMINISHED HAPPINESS FOR EVERYBODY SO I AN JUST ASSUN LIKE NOT DOIN RIGHT SO WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD ANXIETY I THINK WE OFTEN ABOUT THE PERSON LIKE QUAKING ABOUT YOU KNOW PUBLIC SPEAKING OR LIKE GETTING UN THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN HIGH JACK THAT WE'RE ONLY DESIGNE FOR SABRE R TO TIGERS BUT ANXIETY SEEMS TO SERVE BOTH A VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN MODERN LIFE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PHYSICAL THREAT BUT IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE THE FEATURE THAT IF NOT KEPT IN CHECK IF WE CAN'T REGULATE OUR OWN ANXIETY IAM REALIZING THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE IN POSITION TO ASK FOR WHAT WE NEED IN WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR WHAT'S NEEDED OF US AND WHAT OTHERS WANT IN OTHER WORDS ANXIETY SEEMS LIKE A MAJOR BARRIER TO THE GENERATIVE DRIVE I THINK THA THE PLACE TO START IS IF YOU SHOW ME A PERSON WHO HAS NO ANXIETY I'LL SHOW YOU A MANIC I WE ALL HAVE ANXIETY IN US MEMBER IS IS JUST A WORD RIH WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE GETTING AT WERE GETTING AT A SENSE OF TENSION I ER A SENSE OF DISQUIET INSIDE OF US THAT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SOV WE LIKE TO EASE IF WE COULD I IT IS NOT HELPFUL OR HEALTHY IF WE ARE VERY VERY LOW LEVELS OF THAT I BECAUSE THEN OUR STRIVINGS AR CERTAINLY IN THE SUFFER RIHT IS NOT A LOT OF MOTIVATION I TO TO TO GO MAKE CHANGE IN THE WORLD CHANGE IN OUR LIVES I SO WE HAVE TOO LITTLE OF THAT TENSION THAT DOESN'T GO WELL AND AND WOULD THAT MAPS TO A LO A ASSERTEDNESS AGGRESSIONN PROACTIVE DRIVE AS OF THERE OTHER WAYS THAT CAN SHOW ITSELF BUT IT MAPS VERY CLEARLY I THINK TO THAT AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR US ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRE WERE MUCH MORE CONCERNED WITH THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRAND BECAUSE A LOT OF ANXIETY FEELS VERY VERY BAD ANDIT FEELS VERY BAD RIGHT NOW I SO ARE OR HIGH LEVELS OF ANXIETY THEY NARROW OUR COGNINISPECTROM THEY NARROW OR ABILITY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND US TO THINK ABOUT OURSELVES SO SO THE IDEA WITH ANXIETY IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALL HAVE IT AND AND WE CALL IT ANXIETY WE CAN CALL ATTENTION CALL WHATEVER WE WE WANT TO BUT WE WANT THAT TO BE IN IN A HEALTHY PLACE I WHICH WHICH COMES OF COURSE BACK TO THE SELF THAT IF MY LEVELS OF ANXIETY ARE VERY HIGH AND THEREFORE IT'S CAUSING PROBLEMS IN MY RELATIONSHIP LIKE MAYBE I'M I'M ALWAYS ASKING MY PARTONER F ROQEE OR THAT HAPPENS A LITELY OR YOUQUET OR YOU HAPPY WVY OR BECAUSE IS A LOT OF ANXIETY AN ME LIKE THE FIRST PLACE THAT GOES TO LOOK AT MYSELF SO WE COULD SAY OH I HAVE ATTACHMENT IN SECURITY THAT'S A STATING THE OBVIOUS RIGHT WERE A SERGEANT DROW BUT A VERY COMMON ONE I NOWADAYS SAYS I THINK IS NEW IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY IS IM YOU KNOW THAT THE REACHING THE TUGGING THE LINE PHENOMENA YOU TECT SOMEBODY ITYOU THING ABOUT THEM YOU DON'T HEAR BACK AND THEN ATTENTION STARTS TO MOUNT AND THEN I'M DEPENDING ON THE CONTACT YOU MAY EITHER BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PERSON OR EVEN SUSPICIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE PERSON IS UP TO HIM INHERE ITS VERY CONTEXTUAL RIGHT AND I DEPENDS ON THE HISTORY OF BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND THAT RELATIONSHIP BUT THEN THE PERSON WILL REACH BACK EVENTUALLY AND IT EITHER WILL BRING RELIEF OR RELIEF WITH SOME RESETT LIKE WHERE WERE YOU WHAT HAPPENED IM THIS IS VERY VERY COMMON I I SO MUCH SO IN FACT THAT IM I'VE COME TO LEARN AND TALKING TO OTHERS AND THIS IS THAT THE CLASSIC YAU KNO I HAVE A FRIEND WHO BUT REALLY I OTHERS WHO ARE IN THE LANDSCAPE OF LOOKING FOR RELATIONSHIP AND THERE ARE PEOPLE I KNOW WELL WHO GO THROUGH A LOT OF EFFORT TO SET AND INTERMITTENT SCADUL OF RESPONSE THAT CAN NOT GIVE THE OTHER PERSON A SENSE THAT THEY ALWAYS RESPOND WISH SHORT LATENCY BECAUSE INDEED SOMETIMES THEY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND SOMETIMES THEY WON'T WHAT THEIR BASI TRYING TO AS MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON DOESN'T THEACTUALLY TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE OTHER PERSON IN ADDITION TO THEMSELVES BECAUSE I THINK WE COME TO EXPECT A CERTAIN LATENCY OF RESPONSE WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND IF WE DON'T HERE ACT WITH THAT PARTICULAR LATENCY OF RESPOENCE OUR OWN ANXIETY STARTS TO PICK UP AND I CAN BE QUITE DAMAGING TO A RELATIONSHIP IN PARTICULAR TO THE GENERATIVE DRIVES WITHIN US BECAUSE IN THAT TIME THAT WERE STRESSED WERE NOT TENDING TO OTHER THINGS INCLUDING THINGS THAT WE COULD DO FOR THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WERE SO WORRIED ABET AME OUS SEENE AND SWINGERS RIGHT WITH THE PRESENT LEAVES A MESSAGE AND THEN AN LIVES THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP IN HIS OWN MIND AND BREAKS UP WITH THE PERSON AND THEY NEVER ACTUALLY SPOKE RIGHT THAT THAT THERE'S THE ANXIETY RUN WILD AND OF COURSE I REMEMBER THAT WAS VERY VERY POPULAR IN THAT CAME OUT WHY CAUSE IT RESINATED WE KNOW WITH THE INSECURITIES WE FEEL AND NOW WITH THE ABILITY TO FEEL THOSE INSECURITIES IN A MUCH MORE IMMEDIATE WAY THAT PRESENT INTEKES ME BACK RIGHT THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE OF THAT INSIDE OF US WHICH REALLY POINTS TO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE ANXIOUS TOO ANXIOUS FOR COMFORT WHICH AGAIN IF ONE LOOKS INSIDE OR EVEN LISTENS MAYBE TO WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID OR REFLECTED LIKE THERES A LOT OF DATA ESPECIALLY INTROSPECTION TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT RIGHT THE NEXT QUESTION IS ALWAYS WHY RIHT LET'S GO LOOK AT THAT MAYBE THAT PERSON 'S BEEN ANXIOUS THEIR WHOLE LIFE RIGHT MAYBE THA THEY JUST A WRONG TENSE ALL THE TIME E NOGHT SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT OF MENICINE THET CONNAJUST PULLS THAT DOWN PERSONTAY THAT FOR FIFTY YEARS LIFE IS BETTER THAN OSIDE EFFECTS LIKE SO SOMETIMES LIKE THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE RIGHT SOMETIMES THE PERSON'S ANXIETY CAN AGRU THROUGHOUT CHILDHOOD AND MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE THERE WERE DIFFICULT THINGS OR TRAMATIC THINGS THAT HAPPEN MAYBE THERE WIS NOTHING LIKE THAT BUT MAYBE THE PERSON WAS VERY GOOD IT ENGAGING IN THE WORLD AND THEN FELT MORE AND MORE PRESSURES UPON THEMSELVES AND KNOW ONE EVER DID ANYTHING WRONG AND THEY ONLY BEEN REWARDED RIGHT BUT REGARDLESS LOOK AT THE ANXIETY IN YOURSELF GO BACK TO THOSE PILLARS RIGHT AND ONE MIGHT DISCOVER FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE THE THE ANXIETY I'M FEELING IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OTHER PERSON AM I FEELING ANXIOUS BECAUSE I'M INTIMIDATED RIGHT MY FEELING ANXIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IF I DON'T BEHAVE IN A CERTAIN WAY NOW THE NEXT TIME THERE'S A GROUP MEETING THERE'LL BE SOME SNARKY JOKE MA IT ABOUT ME SO ANXIETY SOMETIMES AT'S THE SELF SOMETIMES ITS SO DOUT A LOT A BY A L OGICAL COMPONENT SOMETIMES GOT A LOT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL COPONENT SOMETIMES BOTH RIGHT SOMETIMES IT'S THE ENVIRONMENT SOMETIMES IT'S THE OTHER RIGHT THE OTHER PERSON SO LOOK AT WHY BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE LEARN RIGHT LIKTE WHAT WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE OF ME WHERE IS THAT LEVEL OF ANXIETY HOW DOES IT NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE LIKE WHAT ACTUALLY IS IT HOW'S IT CHANGING HOW UNBEHAVING HOW MIGHT IT BE CHANGING HW MY RESPONDING TO IT SO WHATD WE DOING WERE GOING BACK TO TO THE LOOK IN THOSE TAN CABINETS AND FIGURE OUT WHY WHICH WE CAN DO RIGHT THE VAST MAJORITY AT TIMES BETWEEN OURSELVES IN THE USE OF OTHERS EITHER PROFESSIONALLY OR NON PROFESSIONALLY WE CAN GO UNDERSTAND THE ANXIETY OR THE LACK OF ANXIETY WHY AM I NOT SO MOTIVATED RIGHT ME LET'S A CASE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL DEMORALIZED THEY DON'T FEE IT CAN GET ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD RIHT THE WORLD'S A BAD PLACE AND NOW ON HOW YOU CAN TO MAKE YOUR WAY IN THE WORLD THY START FEELING NIHILISTIC OR NOW THEY FEEL LIKE THERE'S THE APT BOLL IS AGAINST THEM EVEN IN A GENERATIONAL CAPACITY RIGHT AND NOW THEY FEEL DEMORALIZED AND AND THE TENSION INSIDE IS SOOTHED BY THINKS MAYBE THAT'S THE PERSON WOS OVERUSING THE THING THAT SOOTHES RIGHT SO THEY COULD GO LOOK AT LIKE I WAYS KIND OF MOTIVATED AND DID WELL INSPORTS OR THE WELL IN THIS WAS INTERESTED IN THAT RIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S HOW PERSON COULD IDENTIFY FOR EXAMPLE BEING DEMORALIZED SO THAT PROCESS OF INQUIRY GIVES US THE INFORMATION THAT WE CAN USE IN THE SERVICE OF CHANGE AND THE CHANGE WHILE NOT ACHIEVED A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME THE CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IS PREDICTABLE IF IT'S ARISING FROM A PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING I'M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT FRAMES OF MIND IN RELATIONSHIP IN PARTICULAR HOW BEING IN OUR OWN EXPERIENCE SAY ANXIOUS BECAUSE SOMEONE HASN'T RESPONDED TO US AND REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ANXIETY AND DRILLING IN TO IT AND ASKING OURSELVES YOU KNOW WHY MY ANXIOUS AND UNDO I DESERVE TO BE ANXIOUS IS T ABOUT MEARS ABOUT THEM WHETHER NOT THAT'S AVALID PURSUIT OR WHETHER OR NOT FOCASTING ON THE OTHER PERSON AND TRING TO IMAGINE YOU'LL LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR HEAD THAT THEY MIGHT BE DOING THIS OR THAT THEY SEEM TO DO SOMETHING REPEATEDLY THIS OF COURSE RELATES TO MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE SENARIO OF WAITING FOR A TEXT MESSAGE AND FEELING ANXIOUS MAY I THINK SO MUCH OF HOW WE COME INTO RELATIONSHIP ITS OF ALL KINDS I YUKNOW ROMANTIC CERTAINLY BUT A FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS ARE YOU KNOW IN AND AROUND THE TENDENCY TO SWITCH BACK AND FORTH SOMETIMES SEEMINGLY AT RANDOM BETWEEN OUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND WHAT AM I FEELING WHAT AM I EXPERIENCING AND THEN THINKING ABOUT THE OTHER LIKE WHAT IS WHAT ARE THEY THINKING WHAT ARE THEY EXPERIENCING HIM AND THIS IS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HUMAN DYNAMICS REAT I I I WOULD THINK THAT IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON TO JUST LIVE LIFE THROUGH THEIR OWN A FRAME AND LENDS AND NEVER PAY ATTENTION AT ALL TO WHAT OTHERS MIGHT BE THINKING EVEN FORINCE IS THE MOST EXPLOIT OF EXTRACTIVE NARCISIS SOCIO PATH PRESUMABLY IS THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO IN THE ROOM IS GOING TO BE THEIR TARGET BECAUSE OF HOW THAT PERSON MIGHT BE FEELING OF COURSE ON THE BENEVOLENT SIDE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO A POSITIVE GENERAT OF THINGS IN THE WORLD ARE PROBABLY THING ABOUT YOU KNOW AM WHO DO ALINE WITH AM WHO WHO HAS A COMMON GOALS THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO WORK WITH OR BE WITH ROMANTICALLY THAT COULD HELP THEMAN AND THE OTHER PERSON GENERATE SO SO WHAT IS THIS THING THAT WE DO A YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT CALLED AND AND HOW DOES IT WORK UT TO PLACE OURSELVES IN THE MIND OF OTHERS AND WHAT ROLLS DOES IT SERVE AND WHAT GOALS DOES IT UNDERCUT WHEN WE HAVE THIS  SO THNK THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT EVERYTHING FOLLOWS THE SAME SIMPLE PATTERN I SO I START WITH THINKING ABOUT ME I IF I'M ANXIOUS WHY MY ANXIOUS WAS GOING ONINSIDE OF ME THEN I THINK ABOUT YOU ARE YOU ANXIOUS TOO OR MAYBE I'M NOT ANXIOUS BUT I NOTICE THAT YOU ARE I SO THERE'S THE THOUGHT ABOUT THE IVE YAS I CAN'T THINK IN A CLEAR HEADED WAY ABOUT YOU UNLESS I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT ME RIGHT AS IF I'M REALLY REALLLLY ANXIOUS THEN HOW MICE SWAS UNDERS AN AND TRYING GET AN IDEA OF WHERE YOU'RE AT RIGHT SO THEN WHERE DO WE ARRIVE WE ARRIVE AT THE MAGIC BRIDGE OF THE US I THAT'S WHAT CONNECTS US WHETHER THE US IS A FRIENDSHIP ITS A PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP IT'S ROMANCE IHT THERE'S THE BRIDGE OF THE US BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST HOW ERE WHEN AM I ANXIOUS HOW R WHEN ARE YOU ANXIOUS WHAT ARE THINGS LIKE WHEN WERE TOGETHER IT MAYBE HAT MAYBE I'M ANXIOUS WHEN WEARE TOGETHER AND OR WHAT'S THAT TENSION ABOUT YOU'R ANXION WERE TOGETHER AND OU KNOW MAYBE THAT'S FOR REASONS WE COULD TALK ABOUT AND MAKE GLESS MAYBE THERE'S SOME INSECURITY IN ONE OF US OR MAYBE THE OTHER PERSONS BEHAVING IN A CERTAIN WAY THAT'S NOT MAKING HE SEND PERSON FEEL GOOD RIGHT WE WE CAN THEN COME TOGETHER AND SEE HOW DOES US IMPACT THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY AND HOW DO WE THEN TAKE AWAY FROM THE US BEING STRONGER SO TO THINK ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT THE TROMABOND TROMABON CAN BE ENACTED IN HE NEGATIVE WAY IT CAN BE ENACTED IN A POSITIVE WAY AND THOSE TWO PEOPLE WHO CAN GO TO THE MUSAM TOGETHER WHO CAN'T GO TO THE MUSAUMS SEPARATELY RIGHT THEY'RE LIVING IN THE MAGIC BRIDGE OF THE US RIGHT THEY'RE BOTH AT THE MUSAUM BUT NEITHER CAN GO TO THE MUSAM RIGHT NEITHER CAN GO TO THE MUSAM BUT BOTH CAN GO TO THE MUSAM AND THEN THEY TAKE AWAY STRONGER SELVES FROM THAT RIGHT THAT'S AT THAT'S A REENFORCING EXPERIENCE IS POSITIVE IGHT IT BUILDS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IT BUILDS CONFIDENCE RIGHT THAT THE PERSON WHEGT THEY WERE ASSERTED AND THAT WAS GRATIFIED IN A GOOD WAY AND THEY FELT PLEASURE RIGHT SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE US IT IS ABOUT US IN THE MOMENT RIHT BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT HOW TWO PEOPLE ARE IMPACTING ONE ANOTHER IN THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND THIS OF COURSE THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THE CLOSER THE RELATIONSHIP LIKE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAMPLE IN CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS OR FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND I THINK THIS IS OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE IN RELATIONSHIPS MAY THESE THETHE TWO PEOPLE WHO PRESUMABLY ARE THE CLOSEST TO ONE ANOTHER ON EARTH SO A SHARED US T AD THAT PROMOTES UNDERSTANDING AND BOLSTERS A S ENSE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND BOSTERS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT'S GREAT FOR BOTH PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE US WHEN ONE GOES ONE WAY AND ONE GOES THE OTHER BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN RELATIONSHIPS TOO RIGHTER BEGO TO WORK AT DIFFERENT PLACES OR WE BOST ARE OURSELVES OUTSIDE OF RELATIONSHIPS IF WE SEE WHAT THE MAGIC BRIDGE OTHER RELATIONSHIP CAN BE SO WE WE CAN LOOK THERE FOR PROBLEMS LIKE WHY AM I ANXIOUS WHY ARE YOU ANXIOUS WHY ARE WE ANXIOUS WHY YOU ONLY ANXIOUS E WERE WE AND NOT YOU KNOW WE CAN LOOK FOR ALL THAT AND WE SHOULD I BUT WE CAN ALSO EVEN MORE POWERFULLY LOOK FOR THE GOOD THERE  HOW CAN OUR SHARED BOND WHATEVER IT MAY BE BE BETTER FOR BOTH OF US AND WHAT STRONGER INCENTIVE COULD THERE BE THAN TO DO THAT IN RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT ROMANTIC RELATINSHIPS THE ONES THAT ARE CLOSEST US IF THEY'RE NOT ROMANTIC THEY COULD BE FRENCHIS WHATEVER OR CLOSEST RELATIONSHIPS ARE THROUGH THE MOST IMPORTANT VEHICLES SO TO SPEAK TO BETTER HEALTH AND HAPPINESS TO GETT INTO THAT PLACE OF PEACE AND CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT RIGT TH US IS VERY VERY POWERFUL IN FACT EVEN MORE MORE POWERFUL THAN THE IY AND H YOU WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE US AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEBODY THAT WE KNOW AND ARE IN RELATIONSHIP WITH IS BEHAVING THE WAY THEY ARE OR  MIGHT BE FEELING OR CLAIMING THEY FEEL THE WAY THAT THEY ARE HOW USEFUL DO YOU THINK IT IS FOR US TO PUT OURSELVES IN THEIR SHOES UM YOU KNOW I CALDN'T THINK OF ALL SORTS OF WAYS IN WHICH THIS COULD BE BENEFICIAL I CAN ALSO OF ALL SORTS OF WAYS IN WHICH IT WOULD BE FOCUSSING OFF THE SELF AN OUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN WAYS THAT  MIGHT BE DEFENSIVE OF OIDANCE OR YOU KNOW DENY ALL RIGHT THE I'LL COME CLEAN IMING THERE BEEN PLENTY OF TIMES IN RELATIONSHIP WHERE I GET FIXATED ON WHY SOME ONE IS THE WAY THEY ARE BEHAVED THE WAY THEY DID AND UM MORE OFTEN THAN NOT BY TICKING A STEPBACK AND THINKING ABOUT WHY MY REACTION TO THAT IS THE WAY IT IS I DON'T SOLVE THE GOTIN  PROBLEM BUT I GET A LOT FURTHER ALONG IN TERMS OF I'M QUELLING MY OWN ANXIETY AND FINDING A PATH FORWARD RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT WELL MENTALIZATION  WHICH IS THE ABILITY TO DISCERN FEELING STATES INTENTION STATES IN SELF AND OTHERS BET OU WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR OTHERS RIGHT SO THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND FEELING STATES WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF YOU INTENTION WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS RIGHT THAT SHOULD ONLY BE GOOD RIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE IF WE'RE SEEING IT THROUGH A CLEAR LENDS MEANING A LENDS THAT'S NOT BYASED BY SOME PROBLEM LIKE LIKE A DEFENCE MECHANISM OF RATIONALIZATION FOR EXAMPLE OR PROJECTION RIGHT IF WE'RE SEEIN CLEARLY WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE OTHER I AND THE LEARNING IS IS NEVER BAD RIGHT KNOWLEDGE TRUTH IS GOOD SO IF WE LEARN ABOUT THE OTHER BY AND THAT SENSE PUTTING OURSELVES IN THEIR SHOES THEN WE GAIN INFORMATION BUT IT'S THE HEALTH IN US THAT THAT IT'S SO CRUCIAL TO WHAT WE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION RIGHT SO ONE PERSON IT'S A PUT PUT THEMSELVES IN THE OTHER PERSONS SHOES AND AND THINGS IT OOK I THAT PARS I CAN SEE THA PERSON RESPONDING IN IS SASAY PRETTY CALM AN PRETTY CALM ABOUT SOMETHING IT MAYBE THAT'S JUST A GOOD THING MAY BE THERE SOME INTENTION GOING ON AND THAT PERSONS MAINTAINING THEY'RE COOL AND THAT PERSONS CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL IN NAVIGATING AN ARGUMENT OR DISAGREEMENT TO LIKE SOME SOME LIKE REALLY POSITIVE AND POINT RIGHT SO IF A PERSON SEES CLEARLY LIKE I SEE I OOK I SEE THAT YOUI CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE CALM AND I ALSO SEE THAT YOUR YOU'RE TRANIFIGURE THINGS OUT AND TE THINGSTHAT OU'RE SAYING OR SO POSITIVE YOU'RE DISAGREEING WITH ME BUT BELL YOU DON'T SEEM TO MEAN ILL RIGHT THEN I CAN SEE OU KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU'RE CALM IS GOOD RIGHT BECAUSE I'M GETING A LITTLE BIT UPSET AND YOU'RE NOT SO YOU YOU SO AND I SEE THAT THERE'S A BENEVOLENCE IN YOU SO MAYBE OU'LL GUIDE US TO THE PLACE THAT MAYBE I CAN'T RIGHT BUT BUT THINK ABOUT IF THERE'S NOT A CLEAR LENDS INSIDE OF ME RIGHT IF I HASE IA DEFENCE SYSTEM THAT LEADS ME TO EXTERNALIZE RESPONSIBILITY THAT LEADES ME TO PROJECT THERE LEAVS ME DO ALSO TO THINGS THAT ARE NOT HEALTHY NOW I MIGHT THINK WHILE YOURE CALM BECAUSE YOU USE DON'T CARE ABOUT ME RIGHT I MEANS THO THING OF THE SAME EXACT THING RIGHT NOW IN THE EXAMPLE WERE GIVING THE PERSON IN YOUR POSITION IS LIKE BEING REALLY BENIGN AND BENEVOLENT BUT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WHERE THAT IS MISCONTRUED SO IT'S NOT THAT I'S NOT THAT THE INSIGHT THAT PERSON IS CALM I SEETET OR CALM IT'S THAT THERE'S A DEFICITE IN THE MENTALIZATION THE PRESON'S NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THEIR INTENTION RIGHT TWHAT'S COMING THROUGH THEN GETS DISTORTED RIGHT SOMETHING ABOUT DEFENSE MECHANISMS THEY CAN BE THEY CAN BE CLEARER THEY CAN LET LIGHT THROUGH IN THIS BEAUTIFUL WAY THAT HAS FIDELITY ERE THEY CAN BE VERY DISTORTING SO THAT THE THOUGHT IF I'M DISCERNING THAT YOU ARE BENEVOLENT AND YOU YOU SEEM TO BE TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR US BUT I TAKE IN AND YOUSE DON'T CARE ABOUT ME IN YOURE TRYING TO PUT ONE OVER ON ME IF IF I'VE ASSESTED ACCURATELY BUT THAT BUT IT COMES ON THE OTHER END IN A WAY THAT'S CHANGE RIHT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY THERE'S DISTORTION INSIDE OF ME RIGHT SO SO THEN IF I'M REALLY WORKING ON MYSELF I'M IN THE BEST PLACE I CAN BE I'M GOING TO BE BETTER AT MENTALIZING ABOUT YOU AND ME RIGHT EVEN IF I SAY WHAT WE'RE HAVING A DISAGREEMENT I I KNOW I TEND TO GET A LITTLE DEFENSIVE SONG AN BE A LITTLE BYAS TO SEE WHAT'S IN YOU IN A IT HAN A NEGATIVE WAY RIGHTS SO WHAT A MY SEEING I GO CA YOU'RE PRETTY CALM LIKE MAYBE YOU DON'T CARE LIKE NOW I I KNOW I CAN THINK THAT RIGHT BUT I ON YOUR TRYING AND WHEN I SOVE OUR PROBLEM I CONMAGINE WHEN THAT GOES ON INSIDE OF A PERSON WHICH SOMETIMES GOES ON CONSCIOUSLY OR GOES ON UNCONSCIOUSLY OR SOME MIXTURE IT'S SO POWERFUL RIGHT THE PERSONS AWERE OF THEIR OWN STATE WHICH HELPS THEM TO BEWERE THE STATE OF THE OTHERS THE OTHER AND THEN THE INFORMATION THEY'RE GETTING COMES THROUGH WITH FIDELITY AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN INSTEAD OF MAY BE HONGAN TO BLOW THINGS UP NOW MALYING WITH YOU IN SOLVING OUR PROBLEM BECAUSE I SEE CLEARLY ABOUT YOU AND ME AND THAT'S GOING ON ALL THE TIME IT MIGHT SO WELL IT'S COMPLICATED HA LOTT O BACK AND FORTH RIGHT THEU'RE MILLIONS OF THINGS GOING ON EVERY SWID SECOND IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND THAT IS THROWING ALL THIS UP TO THE CONSCIOUS MIND IT'S DOING THINGS RAPIDLY THAT'S GOING ON ALL THE TIME IN US WHETHER WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT OR NOT AND WE WE CHOOSE NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AT OUR OWN PERIL BECAUSE THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO THOSE TO PILLARS AND THEIR TEN CUPBOARDS WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE STRUCTURE OF SELF THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND WHAT COMPRISES THOSE TWO PILLARS TO LOOK FOR WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT LE ME UNDERSTAND BETTER AND EVEN IF THINGS ARE GOING WELL TWE CAN ALWAYS AS YOUYOU SAID NOT THAT LONG AGO WE CAN UNDERSTAND OURSELVES BETTER THE STRONGER I AM THE MORE GENERATIVE DRIVE THERE IS IN ME THE LESS DEFENSIVENESS THE MORE THE AGENCY IN THE GRATITUDE THE MORE UNARMED FOR ET WHATEVER DIFFICULT THING COMES MY WAY SO IF THERE'S A CONFLICT WITH SOMEONE WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE OR THERE SHOULDN'T BE MAYBE SOME ONE'S BEING REALLY AGGRESSIVE AND I GAT A CON TO SAY SOME THINGS AND TRY ANCOUNTER THAT RIGHT IM LAN BE ABLE TO DISCERN ONE FROM ANOTHER I'M LANG TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN BOTH RIGHT I JUST SET MYSELF UP FOR SUCCESS AND IF I'M SETTING ME UP FOR SUCCESS THAN I'M ALSO SETTING YOU UP FOR SUCCESS IF YOU'RE SOME ONE I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH NO MATTER WHAT IT IS AND THEN ULTIMATELY I'M SETTING THE WE RIGHT THTHETHE MAGICAL BRIDGE OF US I'M SETTING THAT UP FOR SUCCESS TOO AND THAT'S HOW YOU SEE AND THESE LEVELS OF EMERGINCE THAT ONO IF YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU AND UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND AND LET'S SAY PERSON UNDERSTANDS WE'VE A GENERATIVE DRIVE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO BE LEF BO YOU THINK I BEST CAN BE A GOOD ONE RIGHT AND THEN WHAT WOULD WE THEN THAN CONTRIBUTE SAY TO A BROADER CULTURE SO A GROUP OF PEOPLE MANTHERE'S TEN PEOPLE BUNCH OF FRIENDS GETTING TOGETHER WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE GOODNESS AT THAT NEXT LEVEL WHICH IS THEN THE CULTURE OF THE LARGER GROUP IN HERING YOUR DESCRIPTION OF MENTALIZATION TISS ABILITY FOR ALL OF US TO GET INTO THE MIND OF ANOTHER AN N TO I TRYING TOIMAGIN MOTIVATIONS AND STATES THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE ANYOTHER RIGHT IT AN O OFSELF ANDOER YET THAT SEEMS LIKE A NATURAL REFLEX THAT'S THAT'S HEALTHY AND IT SEEMS TO SURFACE MOST OFTEN IN EM AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS RIGHT ON SOMETHING DIDN'T GO RIGHT IN SO WE CAN OF EXPLORER LIKE WASN'T THEM WAS AT ME LIKE WAS AT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE YOU KOW WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON WITH THIS PERSON AS A WAY TO TRY AND ARRIVE AT SOME SORT OF OAFULY GENERATIVE UNDERSTANDING BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S ALSO GREAT VALUE IN MENTALIING ABOUT OTHERS UNDER CONDITIONS ON WHICH THINGS ARE GOING WELL SO THAT ONE CAN POTENTIALLY MAKETHINGS OR ENCOURAGE THINGS TO GO EVEN BETTER IN FUTURE INTERACTIONS WITH A FFIRST THING I WAS IS I THINK THE REFLEX IS MOST OFTEN NOT MENTALIZING THAT THE REFLEX IS MOST OFTEN NOT MENTALIZING IGHT BECAUSE THE REFLEX IS OFTEN COME FROM A POSITION OF NOT FEELING SAFE RIGHT THERE'S SOME CONFLICT I DON'T I DON' DON'T FEEL GOOD RIGHT TO SOME CONFLICT PEOPLE AND WE OUGHTN'T GET VERY DEFENSIVE VERY QUICKLY WHETHER WE SHOW IT ON THE OUTSIDE OR WE START PARTITIONING INSIDE AND THAT THE PROBLEMS COME NOT FROM MENTALIZING BUT THEY COME FROM NOT MENTALIZING RIGHT AN AND NOT BEING AWARE THE DIFFERENCE CAS THEN I CONCLUDE I KNOW IT'S GOING ON IN YOU AND I DON'T RIGHT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN ME RIGHT I THINK YOU'RE BEING AGGRESSIVE REALLY I'M FEELING KIND OF DEFENSIVE ON FEELING VONABLE AND THEN I'M I'M GETTING AGGRESSIVE RIGHT BUT I CAN'T HANDLE THATBECAUSE I DON'T WAN TO BE AGGRESSIVE SO URIGRESSIVE IGHT SO THERE'S SUCH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAY COMING AT A SELF OTHER CONFLICT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SAY NOT MENTALIING BUT THINKING THAT YOU ARE VERSE IS MENTALIZING THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IS IT ME I KNOW IT CAN'T BE IS IT YOU IT MUST BE RIHT AND THAT'S HOW A LOT OF THAT GOES AND THEN OF COURSE WHAT'S THE DATEA THAT'S GATHERED THE DATEA THAT'S GATHERED SUPPORTS THAT A A THINK THAT   AS WARS I THINK OF HAPPENED OR BAS UPON THIS LITTLE CONFLICTS AN FRIENDSHIPS AND IN RELATIONSHIPS THE KEY ABOUT MENTALIZING IS THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS MENTALIZING IT GOES LIKE THIS IS IT ME IS IT YOU IS IT US HOW US TO GET AT OUT LET'S FIGURE IT OUT TOGETHER RIGHT IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT DEFENSIVE IT'S NOT AGGRESSIVE IT'S NOT PROJECTING IT'S IIT'S IT'S REALLY ACTUALLY SEEING AND WHA IF IT'S ME I WANT TO BE AWARE OF IT AND SAY YALLICKE WO I GET UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BELLY LOOK ING MA JUST I AM SORRY RIGHT OR IF I MIGHT SE HAT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE BEING AGGRESSIVE AND IT NORMALLY WOULDN'T BE ON ASAILICLE CON ME JUST GET AWAY FROM IS IT LET THE BET THE PERSON I CARE ABOUT COME DOWN COME BACK LATER YOU KNOW OR IF IT'S US IS REALLY SOMETHING BETWEEN US AND LETS SORTED OUTLIKE THE INFORMATION THAT ALLOWS THE HEALTHY RIGHT THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE DECISIONS IS ALWAYS THERE THROUGH MENTALIZING THE DANGER IS WHEN WE'RE NOT MENTALIZING BUT WE THINK WE ARE GOT IT IN KEEPING WITH THINKING ABOUT OTHERS AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM MENTALIZING THAT IS ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OURSELVES AND THE EXPLORATION OF THE CUPBOARDS UNDER THE PILLARS OF STRUCTURE OF SELF FUNCTION OF SELF AND OUR DESIRE FOR ALL THAT TO GUISER UP INTO AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ONE THING THAT WE HEAR ABOUT SO MUCH THESE DAYS AND GENERALLY I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM ARE BOUNDARIES I YOU KNOW YOU'VE CROSS MY BOUNDARY OR I 'M SETTING ABOUNDARY AND A I'VE CERTAINLY A IMBEDDED THE THE MESSAGE IN MY HEAD THAT IN ORDER FOR CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS TO BE AT THEIR MOST LOVING IN MY LIFE SOMETIMES THE BOUNDARIES REQUIRE VERY LITTLE FREQUENCY OF COMMUNICATION BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE RELATIONSHIPS AREN'T ON GOING NA SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON BOUNDARIES AND HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT BOUNDARIES FOR SAKE OF HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS HEALTHY BOUNDARIES ALWAYS START INSIDE AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE THEM SQUARED AWAY INSIDE WE CAN PROJECT THEM OUTWARD IG THE SAME AS IS EVERYTHING WORKS RIGHT IT STARTS WITH THE SELVE AND THEN IT INCLUDES THE OTHER SO LET SAY YOU TOOK AN EXAMPLE OF A FRIEND WHO'S JUST A LITTLE TOO PRESUMPTUOUS RIGHT LIKE THE KIND OF PERSON YOU'D RATHER KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR BUT WHO JUST OPENS THE DOOR AND COMES IN LIKE THAT THAT THAT KIND OF THINK AND YOU LIKE THE PERSONA OT AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESIDENCE IND YO ONT A LOSE THE FRIENDSHIP AND THEN TLESS IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAPPEN HERE IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT A A A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT RIGHT SO THE PERSON MADE THEM QUESTION THEMSELVES LIKE IS THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME LIKE AUSE I DON'T W LIKE THIS PERSON COMING IN MY FRONT DOOR LIKE IS IS THAT JUST ME AND MI BEING WEARED ABOUT THAT OR O THE PRERSON KIND OF STOP AND THINK ABOUT THAT AND THEY CAN TAKE STOCK OFSELF AND THEY CAN ARRIVE AT AN ANSWER RIGHT FOR THEMSELVES LIKE LOOK THAT PERSON MAY CONCLUDE THAT YOUNO WHAT PEOPLE OM AS CLOSE TO AS THIS PERSONT COME IN MY FRONT DOOR YOU KNOW AT THAT'S OQE RIGHT I 'T YOU KNOW I DOING TO SET A BOUNDARY THERE RIGHT IS THAT'S POSSIBLE RIGHT MORE OFTEN WHAT THE PERSON CONCLUDES IS NO I DON'T REALLY WANT THAT LIKE I I DO OUT SHE WANT THIS PERSON TO KNOCK A LITT AN THAT'S OQ NOT SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME IT'S NOT THAT ON BEING A JER IS SOMETHON BEING A BAD FRIEND RIGHT CAUSE WHAT IR THEY SAYING YOU MIGHT OTHER PREPARING FOR WHAT THE OTHER PERSON COULD SAY BUTNO TDHET THEYR COUNTERING WHAT THERE TESTING OUT TO THEMSELVES THAT MEAN HIM A BAD FRIEND NO RIGHT THAT THAT KIND OF THINKS SO HAY THEY KNOWN AND THEY UNDERSTAND AND THEN THEY AN THYVE THE RIGHT TO SET THE BOUNDARY RIGHT LIKE OOK IT'S MY HOUSE I TRY AND BE GENEROUS BUT I SAID WONT PEOPLE COMING IN THE DOOR LIKE YOU COME TO SOME CONCLUSION THAT SETTING THE BOUNDARY IS OQ AND YOU'RE SQUAREED AWAY WITH IT INSIDE THEN YOU COMMUNICATE THE BOUNDARY OUTWARD RIGHT AND YOU SIT HOW DO I WANT TO COMMUNICATE THAT LIKE SAYING HAYMEN DON'T COME IN THE FRONT DOOR ANY MORE LIKE THAT'S NOT SO GOOD RIGHT NOW THE FRIENDSHIP IS REALLY ON THE ROCKS RIGHT BUT TO SAY TO SOME ONE SOMETHING LIKE I I I CARE ABOUT YOU AND I TRUST YOU AND I KNOW YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME BUT UST MAKES ME NERVOUS YOUNG PEOPLE JUST COME IN THE DOOR LIKE DO YOU MIND THET AUS IT OCELIC IF YOU PLEASE NOT KNOCK ON THE DOOR NOW THING HOW THAT'S BEEN DONE LIKE IIT'S SO ACCURATE RIGHT TO WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THE PERSON TO HOW THE PERSON WANTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE OTHER THEN YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD OF EFFECTIVENESS RIGHT AND THE PERSON ALSO IN THAT SENSE HAS SORT OF HE CLEAN CONSCIENCE IT SO TO SPEAK THAT LETS THEM TAKE AN INFORMATION BACK SO LET'S SAY THE OTHER PERSON HOPEFULLY HAS A HIGH JOURNATIVE DRIVE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COULD SAY OH NO I'M SORRY I DIDN' A IDE MEAN TO MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE I KINCS AUTOMATICALLY DO THAT OR YOU I ALWAYS DO THAT MY BROTHER'S HOUSE AND IS CLOSE BY OR WHATEVER THE PERSON IS SAYING NO WORRIES OQUET EVERYTHING IS FINE RIGHT BUT LET'S SAY THAT PERSON DOES GET MAD RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW I OH IT'S GOINE ON IN THIS PERSON RIGHT IS THAT I NOWT WHAT YOU'R DOING AS YOU SEEING SIGNS OF UNHEALTH IN THE OTHE PERSON AND IT MAYBE THAT WO THAT'S NOT SO HEALTHY WITH THE PERSON BUT I LIKE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE FRIENDSHIP AND THAT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF STRANGE ITYO SYNCRASY THEN YOU MIGHT DECIDE YOU KNOW T I WANT TO KEEP THIS FRIENDSHIPSOL START LOCKING THE DOOR NTHE PERSON HAS TO KNOCK OR YOU MIGHT THINK OQUETS THIS IS AT MY SEEING SOMETHING HERE THAT'S ABOUT LACK OF CONSIDERATION RIGHT IT'S ABOUT SELFISHNESS THAT ALTEMATLY MAYBE ABAD ENVY I CAN WALK INTO YOUR HOUSE AND RUIN YOUR PRIVACY WEN I CAN WALKAN JELS TO MAKE YOU FEEL ANXIOUS I I FEEL ENTITLED TO DO THLIKE LOOKS A KIND OF THING THIS WILL COMING THROUGH THE LENDS OF ENVY TEN' YOU START THINKING ABOUT THAT AND AND MAYBE NOT ALWAYS OF COURSE SOMETIMES YOU FIND A FRIEND WHO CAN DO THE RIGHT THING SOMETIMES YOU FIND A FRIEND WHOU CAN'T TAND YOU CAN STIL MAKE THE FRIENDSHIP WORK SOMETIMES YOU FIND A PERSON WHO'S NOT A FRIEND RIGHT AND YOU SEE LIKE THAT'S HOW EVERYTHING IS WITH THIS PERSON YOU NOW IS LIKE THERE'S NO US THERE'S NO US RIGHT AND AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW PEOPLE CAN LEAVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THAT ELTIMALLY ARE EXPLOITIVE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WEATHER IT'S A FRIENDSHIP IT'S A ROMANCE THE IF A PERSON REALLY UNDERSTANDS THERE'S ME TO YOU THE MAGICAL BRIDGE OF US AND THEN WAIT THERE'S NO MAGICAL BRIDGE OF US I FEEL THAT THRE'S A MAGICAL BRIDGE OF US BUT THE OTHER PERS AND DOES IT THERE'S IMMENSE POWER OF UNDERSTANDING AND THEN OF APPROPRIATE SELF CARE AND SELF PROTECTION OVER AND OVER AGAIN NOT JUST TRANGE TO DAY'S EPISODE BUT IN THE PREVIOUS TWO EPISODES IT SEEMS THAT GETTING SQUAREID AWAY WITH ONESELF OR AT LEAST ONE'S OWN INTERNAL PROCESSIES TO SOME DEGREE RIGHT GAINING SOME INSIDE AS TO WERE THE NEGATIVE OR EVEN POSITIVE EMOTION WITHIN US IS ARISING WHEN WE'RE IN RELATIONSHIP TO ANY ONE OR ANYTHING IT IS SEEMS SO KEY S THNK THE FOUNDATION OF IT YET YOU DON'T YOUYOU SAID YOURE LIKE GETTING TO THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IS THE GOAL REALLY AND THAT'S DONE BY CYCLING BACK THROUGH THE CUPBOARDS THAT RESIDE UNDER STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF AND ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT ONESELF AND AND REALLY UNLESS WE ARE TRAIN PSYCHITRIST LIKE YOU NONE OF US REALLY SHOULD BE DOING THAT FOR THE OTHER PERSON IT SEEMS OR THIS IT'S REALLY OUR EACH AND ALL OF OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO DO FOR OURSELFES BUT THAT IT SERVES OTHERS IN SO MANY POSITIVE WAYS RIGHT RIGHT T MENTALIZATION GREECE IS THE PROGRESS OF ALL THINGS GOOD IGHT BECAUSE IT IS ABOT ACTUAL UNDERSTANDING FEELING STATES INTENTIONS BUT I HAVE TO FIRST MENTALIZE ABOUT ME BEFORE I MENTALIE ABOUT YOU AWAY OF PUTTING THIS WOULD BE IF I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU BEFORE I'M THINKING ABOUT ME AMON AFOOL'S ERRAND I YOU HAVE TO START WITH HITSELF AND TO TRY AND ATTAIN CLARITY OFSELF OR TO REALIZE THAT YOU CAN'T RIGHTLIE THAT THATS IT'S ITS A VERY IMPORTANT NEW ANCE IF I KNOW THAT SAY THERE'S DRAMA IN ME ABOUT A CERTAIN THING AND I KNOW THAT I RESPONDING WAYS ERE SOMETIMES MY MOTIONS GET HIGH AND I CAN'T QUITE YE I CAN'T QUITE THINK THROUGH IT ALL RIGHT WHICH CAN HAPPEN TO ME WITH WITH REFERENCES OR OR SOMETHING THAT'S ENCOMPASSING A CERTAIN KIND OF DRAMA I WANT TO BE AWARE OF THAT RICE OT IS IT IDE OF NOT ONLY BEING AWARE OF WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT YOURSELF BUT BEING AWARE THAT THEIR THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOURSELF SO IF I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT A CERTAIN KIND OF INTERACTION ABOUT A CERTAIN KIND OF TRAMA REALLY SETS ME TO PLACE WHERE I'M NOT ABLE TO MENTALIZE I LIKE I NORMALLY WOULD BE RIGHT O'N A ABSERD OF FLYING BLIND RIGHT THEN GOOD FOR ME TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S DOING TO ME SO'S THE LAST TIME TO MAKE CONCLUSION SO LET'S SAY I'M IN THAT STATE LET'S HIM IN THAT STATE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED RIGHT AND NOW WE HAVE SOME SORT OF CONFLICT RIGHT THAND FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT WHAT WAS GOING ON TO ME I'M BRINGING TO THIS A LACK OF CLARITY BECAUSE I'M II'M REALLY ACTIVATED RI'VENESSINCE THE ANXIETY THE TENSION IN ME HAS BEEN RAISED IN THE NEGATIVE EMOTION THAT REFLECTIVE NEGATIVE AFFECT FEELING EMOTION HAS BEEN RAISED IN ME AND THEN I REALIZE LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOWSE CAN AGO IF WE INTERACT ABOUT IT NOW BECAUSE I CAN'T RELY ON ME SO LIKE  CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER THE SAME WAY IF YOU RECOGNIZEIN THE OTHER THAT PERSON WHOISE USUALLY RATIONALS I WAS ALL WORKED UP RECOGNIZE THAT ANY OTHER RIGHT AND MAY THAT PERSON DOESN'T REALIZE THAT THEY STILL ON TO INTERACT ANY SAY CAN WE LET'S LLES REVISIT THIS N LIKE WER BOTH KIND OF COMCOOL AND COLLECTED IGT SO MENTALIZATION GREASES THE WHEELS OF ALL PROGRESS BUT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE HAS TO BE DEPLOYED IN IN A WAY THAT WORKS AND THE WAY THAT WORKS IS I START WITH ME AND I GO TO YOU AND THEN I GO TO US I'M FULLY ON BOARD THE START WITH ME THEN TO THE OTHER AND THEN TO US MODEL IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE OF FACT SO MUCH SO THAT I'M TSTRING YOU BUILD AN IMAGE OF MY MIND WHERE FIRST IS A  KIND OF A RULE WHICH HAS IT YOU NOW IT STARTS WITH SELF UNDERSTANDING AND YOU KNOW THOUGHTFUL STRUCTURE AT INQUIRY ALONG THE LINES OF THE MAP THAT WAS LAID OUT AN EPISODES ONE IN TO OF THE SERIES AN THAT WE'VE BEEN ALLUDING TO NUMEROUS TIMES TO DAY NESS AND THEN THERE'S A SECOND LINE OR OR OR R ULE THAT I'VE GOT YOU KNOW WRITTEN ON THIS IMAGINARY PIECE OF PAPER IN MY MIND WERE ANY TIME I DEFAULT TO THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER WITHOUT FIRST GOING TO MY OWN MAP AND EXPLORING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME THAT MY OWN MAP STARTS TO BECOME BLURRY LIKE UNLOSING ACCESS TO IT IN IT PETENTIALLY COULD DISAPPEAR I'M JUST CREATING THIS IN MY OWN MIND AS A WAY TO I'M CRATE A LITTLE BIT IF I THINK HOW INGS I I LI THEN I I  REALLY GO THERE FIRST PAINTS THE PICTURE YES AND YOU KNOW THAT THE PURPOSE IN HAVING SUCH AT YOU KNOW A AN IMAGE IN MY MIND THAT YOU KNOW ACCESS TO THE SELF AND UNDERSTANDING A SELFAS PETENTIALY DRIFTING WAY IS BECAUSE I FOR ME THERE'S A THIRD LINE IN THI RULE RULE SET THAT I'M IMAGINING WHICH IS THAT THE LESS UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE OF OUR OWN MAP AND INTERNAL PROCESS THE MORE LIKELY I AM WHERE WE ALL ARE TO JUST LATCH ON TO AN UNHEALTHY MAP ANOTHER UNHEALTHY MAP YESI HAVE TO REVE T ALL THE DIRECTIONS OF OUR OWN UNHEALTHY MAP RIGHT WHICH LEADS US TO SOMEONE ELSE IS ON HEALTHY MAP AND THEN WE LATCH ON TO IT LIKE YOU SAID YET ABSOLUTELY YES NOW THAT'S RI BECAUSE IT'S STILL ACTIVE EVEN OF ITS BLURRY OR IF IT'S OBSCURED FROM MY AWARENESS AND A DRIFTING AWAY FI 'M TRY TO GUIDE MYSELF WITH MY BROKEN COMPASS I RUN INTO SOME ONE ELSE WITH A BROKEN COMPASS NOW WE'RE BOTH WANDERING RIGHT SO BE AWARE IF THE COMPASS ISN'T WORKING THE WAY WE WANTED TO CAN WE GO LOOK AT THAT CAN WE CAN WE MAKE THE MAP HEALTHY MAKE THE MAP ACCURATE MAKE THE MAP GUIDE US TOWARDS WHAT WE WANT BECAUSE THEN WE WILL FIND OTHER PEOPLE WHO'VE WORKED ON THEIR OWN MAPS THAT WAY ABSOLUTELY AT YOU KNOWIN SO OFTEN I HEAREABOUT AND FRANKLY HAVE EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW THAT THIS FEELING LIKE OH IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FINDING SOMEBODY WHO IS HEALTHY RIGHT AND THEN THINGS WILL BE MUCH EASIER AND MUCH BETTER AND SURELY THAT HAS TO BE THE CASE AND SURELY THERE HAVE TO BE INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE YOU KNOW HAVE A INTERACTION WITH SOMEBODY THAT LEADS TO A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY AND THE OTHER PERSON IS MUCH HEALTHIER AND AND WHATEVER TRAMA WE COME TO THE RELATIONSHIP WITH IS BEST SUPPORTED OR BETTER SUPPORTED THAN IT WOULD BE IF WE WERE WITH SOMEBODY EXPLOITIVE OR WHO IS A TRULY DAMAGED AT YOU KNOW IT IN SOME WAY WHO BASELY HAD A MAP THOS REALLY UNLESS HE SCREWED UP BUT THAT THEY HAD NOT EXPLORED INNEEDLE ORRS OR THEY NE A LOT OOOR I DON'T SEE THAT VERY OFTEN I DETALLAN SEE PEOPLE WHO AT LEAST FROM MY OUTSIDE READ SEEM TO HAVE HEALTHY MAPS OR OR DOING REGULAR EXPLORATION OF THEIR MAPS AND THERE FOR HEALTHY WHO KNOWS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR WITH THEIR TIME UM IN EVERY DOMAINOL LIFE BUT ONCE AGAIN WE COME BACK TO THIS IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S IN THOSE CUPBOARDS WHAT'S IN THOSE PILLARS AS A NOT JUST IMPORTANT BT CRITICAL STEP IN UNDERSTANDING AND BUILDING OURSELVES IN POSITIVE WAYS AND AS I SAID ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE IN THE SERIES BUT IAM GOING TO SAY IT AGAIN AND I'M SURE AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THI SERIES IS THAT WHAT SO ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THIS MAP IS THAT IT IT SETS A VERY CLEAR AND SIMPLE SET OF IDEALS NOT AS SERLY SIMPLE TO ATTAIN AND AS YOUE SAID IT TAKES TIME BUT AGENCY HANSA THAT IS RATITUDE YOU KNOW EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY LEADING UP TO PEACE CONTENDMENT AND DELIGHT ALL AS ACTION STATES NOT AS PASSIVE STATES TO JUST BASKIN AND OU KNOWIN AND DISAPPEAR AND THIS NOTION OF THE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND AND BY NOW AND IN THIS EPISODE I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE WELL ON BOARD THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS NOT JUST ABOUT GOING OUT AN DOING THINGS IT'S ABOUT DOING THINGS IN SERVICE TO IN AN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS LEARNING KNOWING CREATING NOT JUST OF OTHERS AND IN THE WORLD BUT INSUS YES I I LOVE I LOVE THE THE MAP IM MIGI BICAUSE YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE MAP CHANGING Y AS THE PERSON I IMAGIN THE PRERSON IS BUSYING AWAY IN THE CUPBOARDS  OTHERE'S A LOT TO WORK ON IN THIS CUPBORD IN THEY'R BUSYNG AWAY IN THEY'R DOING THE WORK AND WE CAN SEE THE MAP CHANGING THAT PATH THAT LOOK LIKE A REALLY GOOD PATH ACTUALLY GOES THROUGH A SWAMP WAN SEE THE SWAMP ON THE MAT NOW IT APPEARS ON THE MAP THAT OTHER PATH THAT LOOK LIKE AS A LITTLE CIRCUITOUS HAS A GOOD PATH RIGHT MAY BE A HARDER PATH THAT IS A LITTLE CIRCUITOUS BUT LOOK WHERE IT LEADS I THE MAP BECOMES CLEAR AS WE DO THE WORK ON OURSELVES YES AND ALSO THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT FOR USSIERE REALLY HELPS AVOID A LOT OF THE COMMON PITFALLS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR STICKY LANGUAGE AND STICKY FOR GOOD REASON I MEAN WHAT STICKIER AND MORE INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THEMSELVES IN RELATIONSHIP THAN THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW BOUNDARIES OR OR LABELS LIKE ANXIOUS ATTACH OR SECURE ATTACH AND I'M NOT BEING DISPURAGING OF THOSE LABELS BUT I'M REALIZING THOSE ARE JUST LABELS RIGHT THAT THEY DON'T DEFINE ACTION ITEMS AND SPECIFIC LINES OF INQUIRY TO GET US BACK IN TO OURSELF UNDERSTANDING OVER AND OVER NNOT AS A FULL TIME JOB RIGHT WE ALL HAVE TO LIVE OUR LIVES BUT AS A WAY ACTUALLY TO BE MORE LEANED INTO LIFE IN THE OUTSIDE ORLD THAT THOSE LABELS DEFIND PEOPLE NO BETTER THAN THE NUMERICAL DIAGNOSES AN THE PSYCHIATURIC TAXONOMY BOOK THAT WE GLORIFY ILABELS ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING NUMBERS ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING THEY CAN HELP TAXONOMIES ARE GOOD SOMETIMES LABELS LET US CATEGORIZE THINGS BUT LABELS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR UNDERSANDING NUMBERS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR UNDERSTANDING IF WE LOOK AT OURSELVES WE GET REAL UNDERSTANDING AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE THAT'S WHAT BOLSTERS AGENCY GRATITUDE ALL THOSE GOOD THINGS CLEAR MENTALIZATION GREASINGE WILLS OF PROGRESS MORE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE GETTING STRONGER WE REALLY CAN FIND GOODNESS AND OFTEN DO AND N THAT'S WHY I THINK EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABAT IS VERY HOPEFUL ET IT ACKNOWLEDGES THERE'S COMPLEXITY THEIR PITFALLS RIGHT THERE ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO IT THAT WETO TO BE AWARE OF AND TO BEWARE OF BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ULTIMATELY IT ISN'T POSITIVE THAT WE'RE NOT SPEAKING TO WHATEVER IT IS HIAILING YOU THAT THING CAN BE BETTER I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT YOUR SHARING YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE SURROUND ALL O THIS WITH US AND THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT SAID JH CLEAR AND

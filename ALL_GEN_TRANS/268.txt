HE WAS DRESSED FOR A NGHT OF THE TOWN LIGHT BLAZER BERBERRY SHIRK PATTERED SILKS CAR I ASKED HIM AND ANOTHER PATRON BOTH TO TROIT RESIDENCE IF THEY HEARD OF INGRIR THE FLOOR FOR MARE THEY HAD WHEN SAM GOT UP TO PAY HIS CHECK AFTER WE'D ONLY BEEN TALKING FOR A FEW MINUTES HE SURPRISED ME BY ASKING IF I WANTED TO GO WITH HIM TO CHECK OUT SOME OF THE OTHER SPOTS AROUND TOWN I WASN'T DRESSED FOR IT AND IHAD LEFT MY RECORDING EQUIPMENT ON MY ROOM BUT WITH A HELL SAM SAID IT WAS LOCAYE FOR ME TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SAM HAD A NICE CAR AND MERCEDES AT NEVER COST HIM MORE THAN TEN DOLLARS TO PARKET IN A LOT HE LOVED THAT ABOUT THE TROIT PARKING WAS SO CHEAP HE' MOVED HERE FROM NEW YORK SOME TIME IN THE LATE NINDIES AND FALLEN HARD FOR THE CITY AS WE DROVE HE TALKED UP THE REAL ESTATE HE

HIM IN HIS NEW BEAM W TO A PLACE CALLED THE GREO IT WAS THE TYPE OF ESTABLISHMENT WAS COMMONLY REFERRED TO HIS GROWN AN SEXY RICCORDED ANOTHER ROUND OF BURBON AND SOME WINGS AND FLOATERED WITH THE BARTENER BY NOW WAS CLEAR THAT THESE GOTS WERE LOOKING TO BE WOMEN AND THA WAS WEIRD BECAUSE OF THIS THING THAT SAM HAD TOLD ME EARLIER WHILE WE WERE IN THE CAR TOGETHER HE SAID THAT NOT TOO LONG AGO HIS WIFE HAD GOTTEN SICK AND HE'D TAKEN CARE OF HER FOR A YEAR AND THEN SHE DIED LEAVING SAM AND THEIR TEANAGE SON WITH ONLY EACH OTHER SAM DIDN'T ACTUALLY WANT TO BE DOING WHAT WE WERE DOING TO NIGHT THIS WAS LIKE ONLY HIS SECOND TIME OUT AS A SINGLE MAN HE DIDN'T FEEL READY TO MEET WOMEN TO DATE BUT HE ALSO FELT LIKE IT WAS TIME HE COULDN'T WAIT FOR EVER SO HE WAS DOING WHAT HE FELT LIKE HE HAD TO DO TO MOVE FORWARD   SAMON RIG TOOK ME TO A FEW DIFFERENT SPOTS THAT NIGHT BUT THE ONE THAT I REMEMBER THE MOST WAS A PLACE CALLED FLOODS FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LO LI E A COMMON FAMILY RESTAURANT I

TO THE SAME CONCLUSION ABOUT MY RACE IN GENDER OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO HE SAID THAT BLACK MEN PREFER WHITE WOMEN AND BLACK WOMEN ARE PREFERRED BY A RANGOTANS OH SO THAT'S WIANSING  THEN TRAVON MARTN I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS ONE EVENING ABOUT A BLACK BOY HARASSED AND PURSUED BY A WHITE LATEENO MAN WHO WAS CONVINCED THAT HE DIDN'T BELONG IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND BECAUSE OF THIS COMPULSION THE INNOCENT BLACK BOY ENDED A DEAD MY HEART WAS IN MY GUT THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT CAME INTO MY HEAD HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS PASS PASS I SHOOK IT OFF NO THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT WHEN A SLAVE LEFT THEIR PLANTATION THEY HAD TO CARRY A PASS FROM THEIR MASTER OR OVERSEER SAYING WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHEN THEY WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN NOT HAVING YOUR PASS OR YOUR FREE PAPERS IF YOU WERE FREE WAS DANGEROUS AT ANY TIME ANY WHITE PERSON COULD STOP YOU AND DEMAND SEE YOUR PASS IF YOU DIDN'T PRODUCE IT YOU WERE THROWN IN JAIL HAVING BLACK SKIN ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU SUSPICIOUS AND A WHITE STRANGER COULD BE THE JUDGE AND JURY OF YOUR FATE TRAVON MARTIN DIDN'T HAVE HIS PASS THERE'S A THING WHITE PEOPLE SAY TO BLACK PEOPLE ALL THE TIME I'VE HAD IT SAID TO ME WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET OVER IT IT BEING SLAVERY AND ALL HISTORICAL OPPRESSION WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET OVER IT THEY SAY IT'S IN THE PAST WHAT I WOULD SAY TO WHITE PEOPLE IN RESPONSE IS THAT YOU'RE NOT OVER THE PAST EVERY YEAR YOU FLOCK FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO MOUNT VERNON AND OTHER PLACES LIKE IT TO MONUMENTS AND MUSEUMS AND REENACTMENTS THERE'S PRESIDENT'S DAY AND THE FIREWORKS THAT BLAST OVER GEORGE WASHINGTON'S HOUSE EVERY FOURTH OF JULY

THE DEEP WHICH YOU CONFINED WITH AR OTHER MUSIC AT THEIR WEDSIGHT THE UBSIDE IS THEIR BAND'S NAME WHICH IS THE WOOD CLIPPING WITHOUT THE VOWELS SE L P P ENG NOT COME ACT FOR CHILDHOOD'S END LOOKING INTOR AFFRO FUTURISM OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS I FOUND MYSELF THINKING ABOUT TIME AND SPACE A LOT TIME BECAUSE SO MANY OF THESE STORIES INVOLVED PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THE PAST OR THE FUTURE OR SEEING THE PAST AND THE FUTURE IN THE HERE AND NOW AND SPACE BECAUSE ALL OF THAT TIME TRAVEL IS CEWED BY VERY SPECIFIC PLACES DETROIT OR MOUNT VERNON OR PHILADELPHIA OR WHEREVER DURING THOSE SAME MONTHS I ALSO BECAME SORT OF OBSESSED WITH THESE TWO VIDIOS THAT I SAW ON YOU TWO I COULDN'T HELP CONNECTING THEM IN MY MIND BECAUSE FOR ME THEY WERE BOTH ABOUT A PARTICULARLY PRECIOUS INTERSECTION OF TIME AND SPACE  THE TIME IS THAT PERIOD WHEN CHILDREN HAVE LEFT SCHOOL FOR THE DAY BUT HAVEN'T YET MADE IT HOME AN THE SPACE IS THAT DISTANCE HOWEVER MANY BLOCKS HOWEVER MANY MILES IT TAKES THOSE KIDS TO WALK FROM ONE TO THE OTHER IN OTHER WORDS THESE TWO VIDIOS ARE ABOUT THOSE MOMENTS WHEN KIDS ARE OUT IN THE WORLD ON THEIR OWN THE ADULTS THEY BUMPINTI YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE FIRST VIDIO IT TAKES PLACE IN AT LANTIC CITY TWO BLACKTEEN AGES AN SWEAT PANTS AN SNEAKERS ARE FIGHTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESIDENTIAL STREET ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL WHEN A SLIGHTLY OLDER BLACK MAN IT BEEN ALLY MILLER EMERGES FROM CAMMERA RIGHT AND PUTS AN END TO THE FIGHT WITH A STERN BUT PASSIONATE TALKING TO THE CLIPF WENT VIRAL MILLER WAS HONORED BY HIS CITY STEVARVY HAD HIM ON HIS COUCH I SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME ON MY FACE WILL FEED THIS PAST WINTER AND HAV VIEWDED ON YOU TWO MANY TIME SINCE IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT IT GETS BETTER EVERY TIME I WATCH IT O    MYWHEN IT BEGINS THE TWO BOYS GRAPPL AND FLALE AT EACH OTHER SLOPILY ONE TALL ONE SHALL BE BOTH DEFIANT OTHER KIDS CROWD AROUND RECORDING WITH THEIR SELFONS EGGING THEM ON SGAA OABR A A   THEN SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE MILLER BOPS IN TO FRAME HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS WEARING WORK BOOTS AND IN IT CAP HE IMMEDIATELY STURTS TO CALL OUT THE KIDS WHO ERE RECORD AERY  YO FOS NO AL YOR YO O COW CAL NEXO A MA  FO COL NE O EVERY MA CO FO RAYL COW COWARDS MILLER CALLS HIM THEN HE TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO THE TWO BOYS IN SENT ISNAT  OL O  SO BRNG O SE YOU RING O SE YOU MOR MADNS ISEE ETINGS SO YOU FINFUL REASE YOU MI YOU BECAUSE YOU WONE MY YO DI YOU MA ENEMY  ME SA SOETS NET ORS OA  O TYOU DIVINESO ANOTHER LISTENS AND THEN HE TELLS THE BOYS SOMETHING THEY PROBABLY HADN'T CONSIDERED THAT THEY WERE MOST LIKELY TRICKED IN DEFIGHTING BY SOME ONE WHO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ENTERTAINING AND NOW ALL OF THEIR SO CALLED FRIENDS ARE RECORDING THEM GO AT IT  WHON MA WHOS OSE O RO WHOS OSE  O OUS N I TAT WLS O  WRONG E LOBR OIS O SENS AR YO YO I ALMOST ME ALL THE YO YO YOU ALMOST  MAN YIN CAS O M YOUR OSIN OL GOS O MOR YOIS O YO YO YOR MEN YO YOR MEN YO WHAT SIN FIT SIN SININS AT YAL ME R A MI YO A  O E MI ISO WE AIN'T GOING TO GET NOWHERE LIKE THIS HE SAYS HEAR WHAT MILLER DOES THAT I LOVE I STEER THE CONVERSATION AWAY FROM PERSONAL GRIEVANCES TOWARDS SOMETHING BIGGER HE TRIES TO TELL THESE KIDS THAT THEY ARE PART OF A COMMUNITY HE TELLS THEM THAT THEIR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AN HAT THOSE CONSEQUENCES ONLY GET MORE SERIOUS AS THEY GET OLLDER WITHOUT CONDESCENDING TO THEM MILLER TALKS TO THEM ABOUT THEIR FUTURES THES A GAME AWA ION'T GAME AWA IS WELL AWAY LOLBRA WERERU DON'T MAKE YO DRAT LIKENIS YO IT THER RA IS WI GO AS AT A HE'S NO LONGER JUSTRYING TO GET THEM TO SAVE FACE OR AVOID HUMILIATION HE'S WARNING THE BOY IS THAT AS THEY BECOME MEN YOUNG BLACK MEN THE WORLD WILL BECOME EVEN MORE DANGEROUS FOR THEM MILLER WON'T LEAVE UNTIL THE TWO SHAKE HANDS THEY DON'T WANT TO AT FIRST ONLY THE SHUBBY KID EXTENDS HIS HAND YOUROS I I NOT NOKE E GA UNDERSTAK OU NAN TE GA THE OTHER KID DOESN'T THE SHUBBY KID PULLS HIS HAND BACK IT YEN  YE WOIIS  I OR ASHINHE DOES W SH  H  SH IT'S ACTUALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO EXPRESS HOW WED I WASCH BY THIS FIDIO THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT EVEN WHILE MILLER IS INSISTING THAT THESE TEA NATURS BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR THEMSELVES HIS ACTIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY ALON THAT THERE IS COMPASSION AN WISDOM AND GUIDANCE AVAILABLE TO THEM IT WAS LIKE A WINDOW INTO A WORL WHERE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER SHE'LL GIVE IT DOM I WINDOW THAT I CULD REWINE AND REPWOTCH AND FORWARD TO MY FRIENDS TO QUICK LIKE IT WAS AT ONCE EXHILARATING AND COMFORTING I RODE THAT HIGH FOR A WEEK MAYBE TWO THEN ANOTHER VIDIO POPPED UP IN MY FACE BOOK FEET THEI'S ONE IS SHAKIER AND FROM A LOW ANGLE OBVIOUSLY RECORDED SURREPTITIOUSLY THE VIEW IS OF THE INTERSECTION OF BEDTFORD AVENUE IND CAMPAS ROAD TMID WOUOD HIGH SCHOOL ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET BOOKIN COLLEGES ON THE OTHER I RECOGNIZED IT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE I USED TO LIVE TEN MINUTES AWAY THERE'S STILL SNOW ON THE GROUND AND THE SELPHONE IS BUFFETED ABOUT BY WIND IT'S CAMERA WOBBLES UP BEHIND TWO UNIFORM POLICE OFFICERS WALKING SLOWLY DOWN CAMPAS ROAD THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS BOTH HANDS IN HIS POCKETS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT HAS HIS BATAN ALREADY DRAWN A HANDFUL OF BLACK TEANAGERS WALK OBSTINATELY BEFORE THEM HEADED AWAY TOWARD FLAP BUSH AVENUE THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE VIDIO STARTED ROLLING THERE WERE MOST LIKELY THE BEGININGS OF A SNOWBALL FIGHT BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHO WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT THE POLICE WERE NOT CALLED THEY WERE ALREADY ON SIGHT IN THE FOOTAGE ONE O THE COP SAYS COME ON LET'S GO THOUGH THE KIDS ARE ALREADY GOING THE COP ON THE RIGHT REACHES OUT IT LOOKS LIKE HE SHOVES THE BOY IN A PINK HOODIE THE BOY FLINCHES SNAPPING HIS HEAD AROUND STOP TOUCHING ME HE SAYS THE COP RESPONDS WITH WHAT YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT WHICH IS OBNOXIOUS AND A STUPID QUESTION BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP HIM FROM ASKING IT AT LEAST FIVE MORE TIMES LIKE A KID TAUNTING ANOTHER KID  IT   AT ONE POINT ONE OF THE TEANAGERS FIRES BACK THAT'S WHY WE OUT IT SOUNDS BAD ASS BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE KID IS SAYING WE'RE WALKING AWAY BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT ANOTHER KID IN THE PROCESSION KNEELS DOWN TO PICK UP SOME SNOW BUT THIS LEFT HAND THE COP ON THE RIGHT PULLS HIS TAZOR OUT OF HIS HOLSTER AND BARKS  PICK THAT UP AGAIN ROCK PAPER SCISSORS SNOWBALL TAZER THE KIDS KEEP WALKING AWAY THE COP YELLS PICKD THAT  UP AGAIN ONE MORE TIME AND FOLLOWS WITH A  DO YOU WANT TO RIDE THE LIGHTNING THE VIDIO ENDS AS THE KIDS CROSS THE STREET TO SAFETY AND THE COPS STOPP ON THE CORNER I KNOW I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CAN SEE WORSE MORE UNJUST THINGS HAPPENED TO BLACK PEOPLE ON YOU TWO JUST ABOUT ANY DAY OF THE WEEK HERE FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT BUT THIS VIDY IT WAS STILL HARD TO WATCH ESPECIALLY HAVING SEEN HOW AD BEEN ALLEY MILLER TALKED THOSE KIDS DOWN IN ATLANTIC CITY WHEREAS MILLER WAS TRYNG TO GOT THE TEANATORS TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A DULTS THEY COP IN THIS VIDIOE SOUNDED LIKE A TEA NATER HIMSELF BULLYING AND PROVOKING WAT'S WORSE HE ALMOST SEEMED TO BE ENJOYING IT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HE CARED ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE KIDS AFTER THEY DESERTED THAT CORNER    I TOLD MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS FIG OR TOO I SENTHEN LINK AROUNDD IT WASN'T AS POPULAR CLIP AS THE ONE WAT MILLER I READ EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT IT I FOUND OUT THAT THET KIDS MOST LIKELY WENT TO MIDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL AND A FEW WEEKS LATER I WENT TIM ID WOULD HIGH SCHOOL AND STOOD ON THE CORNER OF BEDFRD AVENUE AN CAMPAS ROAD WEA WANTED TO FIND SOME ONE WHO OAD WITNESS THE INCIDENT I WAS ANGRY ON BEHALF OF THOSE YOUNG MEN AND I WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY FELT YET I FOUND ONE OF THEM IMMEDIATELY AND THEN THE OTHERS FOUND ME   ME AL HE BACK AL A OS THE BACK TORTUSTHERE IN TAPERED GRAY SWEATS AN COLORFUL NAPSACKS THEY TOLD ME THEY CAME TO THI SPOT ALMOST EVERY DAY WHAT CHICKEN AND FRIES AND RICE SLAT BOX WITH EACH OTHER KICKED IT WITH GIRLS AND WAITED FOR THE REST OF THEIR CREW TO GOPLAY BASKETBALL DOWN THE BLOCK HE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT MY MICROPHONE WAS FOR AND IF THEY CULD GET MONEY AND GIRLS FROM BEING ON THE RADIO AND IF I COULD BUY THEM LUTCH I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WERE DOING ON THE DAY THAT THE VIDIO WAS RECORDED ONE OF THEM SAID HE WAS CUTTING CLASS T OTHERS SAID THEY WEREN'T I ASKED THEM WHY THEY THINK THE COPS CAME SINCE THEIR HIGH SCHOL HAS ITS OWN SECURITY ONE OF THEM SAID THAT SOME OTHER KID'S CROSS O SHOOT WERE THROWING SNOW END THE COPS THOUGHT IT WAS TUS YEONE O THE BOYS SAID IT WAS THEM BUT STILL IT WAS ONLY SNOW BALLS  I  I  I I WA JUST LA O   A O    I ADON LI US GOIN I OS HADN I I ASKED IF THEY WERE SCARED WHEN IT HAPPENED IA COUPLE OF SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS COOLER THAN I'D EVER BEN AT THAT AGE SAID NO NOT REALLY A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SAID EMPHATICALLY OF COURSE HE WAS SIXTOO MY HEIGHT I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW TALL SOMEOF THE BOYS WERE NONE OF THEM OLDER THAN SIXTEEN I WAS AL SO SURPRISED AT HOW NOT ANGRY THEY SEEMED I GREW UP ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES FROM HERE IN A SIMILAR NEIGHBORHOOD AND QUEENS NOT SO LONG AGO I THOUGHT BUT WHEN ASKED THEM WHY THEY THOUGHT THIS HAD HAPPENED TO THEM AT ALL ONE OF THE OLDER BOYS TALKED TO ME LIKE HE WAS EXPLAINING WHY HUMANS NEED FOOD LIE THE COP WAS WHITE NO  LIKE BLACK A  I I AN WE LAT TE IIT  IMAYBE THIS IS JUST ME BUT I LOOKED BACK ON WALKS HOME FROM SCHOOL AS MY FIRST REAL FLIRTATIONS WITHINDEPENDENCS A SACRED TIME AND SPACE BETWEEN MY TEACHERS RULES AND MY PARENTS FRESTRICTIONS THET CKITSON THAT VIDIO THIS WAS THEIR SCHOOL THIS WAS THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD MOST OF THE ONES I TALKED TO LIVE ONLY FOUR OR FIVE BLOCKS AWAY AS FAR AS THEIGHBOR CONCERNED THIS WAS THEIR CORNER I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE TO BE FIRMLY IN YOUR TIME AND SPACE AND RUNT UP AGAINST A COP WITH A TAZER THREATENING TO ELECTROCUTE U IF YOU DON'T PUT DOWN THAT SNOW BALL WAS CRAZIER TO ME IS THAT I'VE WALKED THROUGH THIS INTERSECTION AT BEDFRD AVENUE IN CAPUS ROAD PASS THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THROUGH THE BROOKLYN COLLEGE CAMPAS MANY TIMES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BENEATH ITS LANDMARK GILDED CLOCK TOWER BROOKLYN COLLEGE COULD BE A CAMPAS QUAT FROM A CORNY NINETEEN FIFTY SO EXCEPT TEEMING WITH STUDENTS FROM CULTERS ALL OVER NEW YORK E SOMETHING ABOUT A PRACTICALLY STREAMS WELCOME THINGS ONLY GET BETTER FROM HERE THE YOUNG BLACKMEN IN THAT VIDIO CAME OUT OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL THAT DAY AND STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THAT PROMISE WHAT COULD BE THE NEXT GRATE SPACE AN TIME IN THEIR LIVES WAS A COLLEGE LITERALLY ACROSS THE STREET BUT THEY WERE SHOET AWAY TOLD THEY DIDN'T BELONG AS FAR AS METAPHORS SCHOD THIS ONE COULDN'T BE LESS AMBIGUOUS BUT NONE OF THIS SEEMED TO BOTHER THE BOYS OR AT LEAST NOT THAT THEY LET ON THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY HAD BEEN MADE TO FEEL UNWELCOME SO CLOSE TO HOME IN SCHOOL YET THEY WEREN'T FASTERING WITH RESENTMENT THIT WEREN'T SEEM THE TRAGEDY IN IT THAT I WAS SEEING AFTER I FINISHED TALKING TO THEM I WENT ACROSS THE STREET TO FIND THE BROOKLYN COLLEGE PROFESSOR WHOAD RECORDED THE INCIDENT ALEX WAT TALLEY TEACHERS SOCIOLOGY AND ALSO HAPPENS TO RUN THE SCHOOLS POLICING AND SOCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT LEAVING WORK THAT DAY HE'D SEEM THE TWO COPS TO SEND ON BEDFRD AVENUE AND CAMPAS ROAD FOLLOWED THEM AND IT WAS HIS RECORDING THAT ENTED UP ON YOU TWO AS WELL AS A FEW LOCAL NEWS WEBSIGHTS WE TALKD BRIEFLY ABOUT HOW REPEATED INCIDENCE LIKE THIS COULD EFFECT THE BOYS PSYCHES HE AGREED THAT NO MATTER HOW COOL THEY SEEM NOW OVER TIME THEIR HOPES FOR THEIR OWN FUTURES COULD POSSIBLY DARKEN BUT THEN ALEX ASKED ME HOW OLD I WAS WHEN I TOLD THIM FORTY THREE HE SAID THAT I HAD MISSED THE HEIGHT OF THE STOPIN FRISGERA I WAS NOT A TEA NAGER OR EVEN A YOUNG MAN IN NEW YORK CITY WHEN UNPROMPTED POLICE HARASSMENT WAS AT ITS WORST SO THE TAZOR INCIDENT OUTRAGED ME BUT WHAT THESE COUD HAD SEEN THEIR OLDER BROTHERS SISTERS AND IN SOME CASES PARENTS GO THROUGH HAD CONDITIONED THEM TO BE A BIT MORE STOIC IT STUNG A LITTLE BIT TO HAVE THIS WHITE ACADEMIC TOLD ME THAT I COULDN'T QUITE RELATE TO A YOUNG BLACKMAN'S EXPERIENCE I GUS WHEN I FIRST APPROACHED THOSE BOYS A PARD ON ME HOPE THAT LIKE IBONALY MILLER IN THE ATLANTIC CITY VIIO I WOULD JUST ROLL ABOUT A NOWHERE I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR WORLD THAT THEY KNOW PLUS SOME MORE INSTEAD I WAS JUST ANOTHER

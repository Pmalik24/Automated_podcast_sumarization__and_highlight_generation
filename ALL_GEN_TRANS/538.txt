WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONCAS TSO SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  I MAENDER HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE TO BRING YOU ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIO IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WO'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CAREVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK OM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM AN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOURE GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WAN A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DO CALM SLASH HU BEREMEN TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DREAMING LEARNING DURING DREAMING AN UNLEARNING DURING DREAMING IN PARTICULAR UNLEARNING OF TROUBLING EMOTIONAL EVENTS NOW MY INTEREST IN DREAMING GOES WAY BACK WHEN I WAS A CHILD I HAD A FRIEND AND HE CAME OVER ONE DAY AND HE BROUGHT WITH HIM A MASK THAT HAD A LITTLE RED LIGHT IN THE CORNER HE HAD PURCHASED THIS THING THROUGH SOME MAGAZINE ADD THAT HE HAD SEEN AND THIS MASK WAS SUPOST TO DIS A TRIGGER LUCID DREAMING LUSE A DREAMING IS THE EXPERIENCE OF DREAMING DRING SLEEP BUT BEING AWARE THAT ONE IS DREAMING AND IN SOME CASES BEING ABLE TO DIRECT ONES DREAM ACTIVITIES SO IF YOU WERE IN A LOSE A DREAM AND YOU WANT A FLY FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLE REPORT BEING ABLE TO INITIATE THAT EXPERIENCE OF FLYING OR TO CONTORT THEMSELVES IN TO AN ANIMAL OR TO TRANSPORT THEMSELVES TO WHEREVER THEY WANT WITHIN THE DREAM I TRIED THIS DEVICE AM THE WAY IT WORKED AS YOU PUT ON THE THE MASK YE A DURING WAKING STATE WIDE AWAKEAN YOU'D LOOK AT THE LILE LIGHT FLASHING IN THE CORNER THEN YOU'D ALSO WEAR IT WHEN YOU WENT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND INDEED WHILE I WAS ASLEEP I COULD SEE THE RED LIGHT PRESUMELY THROUGH MY EYELIDS ALTHOUGH FOR ALL I KNOW I D OPEN MY EYES I DON'T KNOW I WAS ASLEEP AND THEN BECAUSE I WAS DREAMING AND I WAS EXPERIENCING SOMETHING VERY VIVID I WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZED THAT I WAS DREAMING AND THEN STRIED TO DIRECT SOME OF THE EVENTS WITHIN THAT DREAM NOW LUS A DREAMING OCCURS IN ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE AND IN A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE THEY LUSE  DREAM ALMOST EVERY NIGHT SO MUCH SO THAT MANY OF THEM REPORT THEIR SLEEP NOT BEING AS RESTORATIVE AS IT WOULD BE OTHERWISE NOW ALL THIS IS TO SAY A THAT LUSE A DREAMING AND DREAMING ARE PROFOUND EXPERIENCES WE TEND TO FEEL EXTREMELY A ATTACHED TO OUR DREAM EXPERIENCE AM THIS MAY EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A VERY INTENSE DREAM THEY NEED TO SOMEHOW TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT THAT DREAM OR TELL SOME ONE ABOUT THAT DREAM I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT BEHAVIOR IS ABOUT BUT SOMETIMES WE WAKE UP AND WE FEEL SO ATTACHED TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS STATE THAT WE CALL DREAMING THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INTENSE NEED TO SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE PRESUME LE TO PROCESS IT AND MAKE SENSE OF IT NOW NUMEROUS PEOPLE THROUGHOUT HIS TORY HAFE TRIE TO MAKE SENSE OF DREAMS AND AM IN SOME SORT OF ORGANIZED WAY THE MOST FAMOUS OF WHICH OF COURSES A SIGMANFROID WHO TALKED ABOUT SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATIONS IN DREAMS A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN KIND OF DEBUNKED ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT A THERE'S SOME INTEREST IN WHAT THE SYMBOLS OF DREAMING ARE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN MORE DEPTH TO DAY ALTHOUGH NOT FRAUDIAN A THEORY IN PARTICULAR SO I THINK IN ORDER TO REALLY THINK ABOUT DREAMS AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AND HOW TO MAXSIM EYES THE DREAM EXPERIENCE FORSAKE OF LEARNING AND UNLEARNING THE BEST WAIY TO DRESSES IS TO LOOK AT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF SLEEP TO REALY JUST WHAT DO WE KNOW CONCRETELY ABOUT SLEEP SO FIRST OF ALL AS WE GET SLEEPY WE TEND TO SHUT OUR EYES AND THAT'S CAUSE THERE ARE SOME AUTONOMIC CENTERS IN THE BRAIN SOME NORONS THAT CONTROL CLOSING OF THE EYELIDS WHEN WE GET SLEEPY AND THEN WE TRANSITION INTO SLEEP AND SLEEP REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG WE SLEEP IS GENERALLY BROKEN UP INTO A SERIES OF NINETY MINUTES CYCLES THESE ULTRADIAN CYCLES SO EARLY IN THE NIGHT THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES TEND TO BE COMPRIZED MORE OF SHALLOW SLEEP AND SLOW WAVE SLEEP SO STAGE ONE STAGE TOO ET CETERA AND WHAT WE CALL SLOW WAVE SLEEP I'LL GOING TO DETAIL ABOUT WHAT ALL THIS MEANS IN A MOMENT AND WE TEND TO HAVE LESS SO CALLED REM SLEEP R E M SLEEP WHICH STANDS FOR RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP AND I'LL TALK ABOUT RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN DETAIL SO EARLY IN THE NIGHT A LOT MORE SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND LESS REM FOR EVERY NINETY MINUTE CYCLE THAT WE HAVE DURING A NIGHT OF SLEEP WE TEND TO START HAVING MORE AND MORE REM SLEEPS A MORE OF THAT NINETY MINUTE CYCLE IS COMPRISED OF REM SLEEP AND LESS OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP NOW THIS IS TRUE REGARDLESS OF WERTHER NOT YOU WAKE UP THE MILL THE NIGHT TO USE THE RESTAURUM OR YOUR SLEEP IS BROKEN THE MORE SLEEP YOU'RE GETTING ACROSS THE NIGHT THE MORE REM SLEEP YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AND REM SLEEP AND NON REM AS I'LL REFER TO IT HAVE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT ROLLS IN LEARNING AND UNLEARNING AND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEARNING AND UNLEARNING OF DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION AND THIS HAS ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR LEARNING OF MOTOR SKILLS FOR UNLEARNING OF TRAMATIC EVENTS OR FOR PROCESSING EMOTIONALLY CHALLENGING AS WELL AS EMOTIONALLY PLEASING EVENTS AND AS WE'LL SEE ONE CAN ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THEIR DAYTIME ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO ACCESS MORE SLOW WAVE SLEEP OR NON REM SLEEP AS WILL CALL IT OR MORE REM SLEEP DEPENDING ON YOUR PARTICULAR EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL NEEDES SO THROULY A REMARKABLE STAGE OF LIFE THAT WE HAVE A LOT MORE CONTROL AND POWER OVER THAN YOU MIGHT BELIEVE WE'LL ALSO TALK ABOUT LUCE A DREAMING RELSIGA TALK ABOUT HALLUCINATIONS AND HOW DRUG INDUCED HALLUCINATIONS HAVE A SURPRISING SIMILARITY TO A LOT OF DREAM STATES AND YET SOME REALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES O Q SO LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT SLOW WAVE SLEEP OR NON REM SLEEP NIW REALIZE THAT SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND NON REM SLEEP ARE AN EXACTLY THE SAME THING SO FOR YOUR SLEEP OF FYCIONATOS OUT THERE I AM LUMPING RIGHT NOW AS WE SAY IN SCINCE THERE ARE LUMPERS AND THERE ARE SPLITTERS AND I AM BOTH SOMETIMES A LUMP SOMETIMES I SPLIT FOR SAKE OF CLARITY AND EASE OF CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW I'M GOINGTO BE A LUMPER SO 'M WHEN I SAY SLOW WAVE SLEEP I ME NONREM SLEEP GENERALLY ALTHOUGH ACNOWLEDGE THERE IS A DISTINCTION SLOW WAVE SLEEP SO SLOW WAVE SLEEP IS CHARACTERIZED BY A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF BRAIN ACTIVITY IN WHICH THE BRAIN IS METABOLICALLY ACTIVE BUT THAT THERE'S THESE BIG SWEEPING WAVES OF ACTIVITY THAT INCLUDE A LOT OF THE BRAIN UM IF YOU WANT A LOOK T HIS UP THERE YOU CONFIND EVIDENCE FOR SWEEPING OF OF WAVES OF NERAL ACTIVITY ACROSS A SOCIATION CARTECS ACROSS BIG SWATHS OF OF THE BRAINSTEM THE SO CALLED PONS CENICULATE OCCIPITAL A PATHWAY THIS IS BRAINSTEM A THALYMUS AND THEN CARTEX  FOR FOR THOSE OF EITHER INTERESTED ALTHOUGH MORE OF THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR IN REMSLEEP NOW THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT SLOWWAVE SLEEP ARE THE NEROMODULATORS THAT TEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT THAT ARE MOST ACTIVE AND LEAST ACTIVE DURING SLOWWAVE SLEEP AND HERS WHY TO REMIND YOU NEROMODULATORS ARE THESE CHEMICALS THAT ACT RATHER SLOWLY BUT THEIR MAIN ROLL IS TO BIAS PARTICULAR BRAIN CIRCUITS TO BE ACTIVE AND OTHER BRAIN CIRCUITS DO NOT BE ACTIVE THESE ARE LIKE THE MUSIC PLAYLIST SO THINK OF NEROMODULATORS AND THESE COME IN THE NAMES OF ASEDTOCOLING NOR APINEFERENCE ERATONAN AND DOPOMIN THINK OF THEM AS A SUGGESTING PLAYLISS ON YOUR ADIO DIVISO YOU KNOW CLASSICAL MUSIC IS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT IN FEEL AND TONE AND A A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES FROM LIKE THIRD WAVE PUNK OR FROM OM YOU KNOW HIPPOP RIGHT SO THINK OF THEM IS BISING TOWARD PARTICULAR JONRAS OF NURL CIRCUIT ACTIVITY OCE MELLOMUSIC VERSES REALLY AGGRESSIVE FAST MUSIC OR RHYTHMIC MUSIC  THAT INCLUDES LYRICS VERSES RHYTHMIC MUSIC THAT DOESN'T INCLUE LYRICS THAT'S AT THAT'S MORE LESS THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THESE NERMODULATORS AND THEY ARE ASSOCIATED AS A CONSEQUENCE WITH CERTAIN BRAIN FUNCTIONS SO WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE AND JUST TO REVIEW ASEDO COLING IN WAKING STATES IS A NEROMODULATOR THAT TENDS TO AMPLIFY THE ACTIVITY OF BRAIN CIRCUITS ASSOCIATED WITH FOCUS AND ATTENTION NOR APINEFERAN IS E NEROMODULATOR THAT TENDS TO AMPLIFY THE BRAIN CIRCUITS ASSOCIATED WITH ALERTNESS AND THE DESIRE TO MOVE CERATONIN IS THE NEROMODULATOR THAT'S RELEASED INTENDS TO AMPLIFY THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BLISS AND THE DESIRE TO REMAIN STILL AND DOPOMINE IS THE NEROMODULATR THAT'S RELEASED AND THEES ASSOCIATED WITH AMPLIFICATION OF THE NURL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY ASSOCIATD WITH PURSUING GOALS AND PLEASURE AND REWARD OCHE SO EIN SLOWWAVE SLEEP SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING HAPPENS THERE IS ESSENTIALLY NO ASEDTO COLING ASEDOCOLING PRODUCTION AND RELEASE AND ACTION FROM THE TWO MAJOR SITES WHICH ARE IN THE BRAIN STEM WHICH FROM A NUCLEUS IVE IT S APPARBYGEMINAL NUCLEUS IF YOU REALLY WANT O NO OR FROM THE FORBRAIN WHICH IS NUCLEUS PISALUS AND YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THESE NAMES BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT'S WHY I PUT THEM OUT THERE ASEDOCOLING PRODUCTION PLUMETS IT'S JUST ALMOST TO ZERO AND ASEDOCOLING AS I JUST MENTION IS ASSOCIATE WITH FOCUS SECANS THINK OF SLOWWAVE SLEEP AS THESE BIG SWEEPING WAVES OF ACTIVITY THROUGH THE BRAIN AND A KIND OF DISSTORTION OF SPACE AND TIMES THAT WERE NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON ANY ONE THING NOW THE OTHER MOLECULES THAT ARE VERY ACTIVE AT THAT TIME ARE NOR EPINEFERAN WHICH IS A LILEBIT SURPRISING CAUSE NORMALLY IN WAKING STATES NOR UP AN EFFRONT IS GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF A LEARTNESS AND THE DESIRE TO MOVE BUT THEIRE'S NOT A TON OF NOR UP AN EFFRAND AROUND IN SLOWWAVE SLEEP BUT IT IS AROUND SO THERE'S SOMETHING ASSOCIATE WITH THE MOVEMENT CIRCUITRY GOING ON IN SLOWWAV EF SLEEP AND REMEMBER THIS IS HAPPENING MOST SLEEP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NIGHT YOUR SLEEP IS DOMINAT BY SLWWAVEF SLEEP SO VERY NO ASITO CALLING VERY LITTLE NOR UP AN EFFEREND ALTHOUGHTHERE IS SOME AND A LOT OF SERATONING AND CERATONAN AGAIN IS ASSOCIATE WITH THIS DESIRE AH THE SENSATION OF KIND OF BLISS OR WELL BEING BUT NOT A LOT OF MOVEMENT AND DURING SLEEP YOU TEND NOT TO MOVE NOW IN SLOWWAVE SLEEP YOU CAN MOVE YOU'RE NOT PARALYZE S YOU CAN ROLL OVER IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SLEEP WALK TIPICALLY ITS GOING TO BE DURING SLOW WAVEF SLEEP AND WHAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THROUGH SOME A KIND OF SEDISTIC EXPERIMENTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE DEPRIVED SPECIFICALLY OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND THAT CAN BE DONE BY WAKING THEM UP IN TH AS SOON AS THE ELECTRODE RECORDING SHOW THAT THEIRE IN SLOW WAVE SLEEP OR BY A CHEMICALLY ALTERING THEIR SLEEP SO THAT IT BISES THEM AWAY FROM SLOWWVE SLEEP WHAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IS THAT MOTOR LEARNING IS GENERALLY OCCURRING IN SLOW WAVEF SLEEP SO LET' SAY THE DAY BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU WERE LEARNING SOME NEW DANCE MOVE OR YOU AR LEARNING SOME SPECIFIC MOTOR SKILL EITHER A FINE MOTOR SKILL OR A COARSE MOTOR SKILL SO LET AY AM ITS A NEW FORM OF EXERCISE AR A SOME NEW CORDNINNATED MOVEMENTS THISCOBEP AM CORDNATE MOVEMENT AT THE LEVEL OF THE FINGERS OR TO BE CORDNAE MOVEMENT THE LEVEL HA WHOLE BODY IN AND LARGE LIM MOVEMENTS IT COULD INVOLVE OTHER PEOPLE ARE TO BE A SOLLOW ACTIVITY LEARNING OF THOSE SKILLS IS HAPPENING PRIMARILY DURING SLOW WAVE SLEEP IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT IN ADDITION SLOWWAVE SLEEP HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEARNING OF DETAILED INFORMATION NOW THIS IS AN ALWAYS COGNATIVE INFORMATION WERE CAN TALK ABOUT COGNIVE INFORMATION BUT THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ALON THESE LINES INVOLVE HAVING PEOPLE LEARN VERY DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT VERY SPECIFIC RULES AN THE WAY THAT CERTAIN WORDS ARE SPELLED THEY TEN TO BE CHALLENGING WORDS SO IF PEOPLE ARE TESTED AND IN TERMS OF THEIR PERFORMANCE ON THESE TYPES OF EXAMS AND THEI'RE DEPRIVED OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP THEY TEND TO PERFORM VERY POORLY SO WE CAN THINK OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP IS IMPORTANT FOR MOTOR LEARNING MOTOR SKILL LEARNING AND FOR THE LEARNING OF SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT SPECIFIC EVENTS AND THIS TURNS OUT TO BEFUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW THAT SLOW WAVE SLEEP IS PRIMARILY IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT AND MOTOR LEARNING IS OCCURRING PRIMARILY EARLY IN THE NIGHT AND DETAIL LEARNING IS OCCURRING EARLY IN THE NIGHT NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE WAKING UP AFTER ONLY THREE FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP THIS MIGHT BE INFORMATIVE THIS MIGHT TELL YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO LEARN AND NOT ABLE TO LEARN IF THAT WERE TO BE THE ONLY SLEEP THAT YOU GET ALTHOUGH HOFULLY THAT'S NOT THE ONLY SLEEP THAT YOU GET BUT WE 'RE GOING TO DIVE DEEP INTO HOW IT IS THAT ONE CAN MAXIMIZE MOTOR LEARNING IN ORDER TO EXTRACTS AY MORE DETAIL INFORMATION ABOUT CORDINATED MOVEMENTS AND HOW TO MAKE THEM FASTER OR SLOWER THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR CERTAINT SPORTS I MIGHT BE I ALMOST CERTAINLY IMPORTANT FOR CERTAIN SPORTS A IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR ANY KIND OF CORDINATIVE MOVEMENT LIKES THE LEARNING TO PLAY THE PIANO OR AM FOR INSTANCE HOW TO A LEARN SYNCRONIZED MOVEMENTS WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SO MAY BE I I MENTION THE EXAMPLE OF DANCE EARLIER IF YOU'VE A LIKE ME A A FEW YEARS AGO I SET OUT TO TO LEARN TANGO BECAUSE I'VE SOME ARGENTINE A RELATIVES IN T IF I WAS ABYSMAL I NEED TO RETURNN TO THAT AT SOME POINT AM A THE I WAS JUST ABSMAL AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS ABOUT BEING ABYSMAL AT LEARNING DANCEIS THAT THE SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TA SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES ALSO SO AM I NON NOW MAYBE IN THE MONTH UN NERROL PLACTISIALL EXPLORE THAT AGAIN AS AS A A SELF EXPERIMENTATION BUT THE KEYTHINGS TO KNOW ARE SLOWWAVE SLEEPS INVOLVED IN MOTOR LEARNING IN AND DETAILED LEARNING THERE'S NOW A SUT OF CULLING AROUND AT THAT TIME HAS THE BIG AMPLITUDE ACTIVITY SWEEPING THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN AND THAT THERE'S THE RELEASE OF THESE NORMAGELES NOR UP IN EFFERAN AND CERATONAN AND AGAIN THAT'S ALL HAPPENING EARLY IN THE NIGHT SO ATHLETES PEOPLE THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PERFORMANCE IF YOU HAPPEN TO WAKE UP AFTER JUST A COUPLE HOURS OF YOU KNOW THREE FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP BECAUSE YOURE EXCITED ABOUT A COMPETITION THE NEXT DAY A PRESUMABLY IF YOU ALREADY TRAINED THE SKILLS THAT YOU NEED FOR THE EVENT YOU SHOULD BE FINE TO ENGAGE IN THAT PARTICULAR ACTIVITY NOW IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE BETTER TO GET A FULL NIGHT SLEEP AND T YOU KNOW WHAT FULL NIGHT SLEEP I FOR FOR YOU AT SIX HOURS THAN S ALWAYS CAN BE BETTER TO GET MORE MORE SLEEP THAN IS TO GET LESS HOWEVER I THINK SOME PEOPLE A GET A LITTLE BIT A OVERLY CONCERNED THAT IF THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR FULL NIGHTS SLEEP BEFORE SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL EVENT THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE IS GOING TO PLUM IT PRESUMALY IF YOU'VE ALREADY LEARND WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND IT STORED IN YOUR NURL CIRCUITS AND YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE THOSE CORDINATIVE MOVEMENTS WHAT THE LITERATURE ON SLOWWAVE SLEEP SUGGESTS IS THAT YOU WOULD BE REPLENISH THAT THE MOTOR LEARNING AND THE RECOVERY FROM EXERCISES GOING TO HAPPEN EARLY IN THE NIGHT SO WE'LL JUST PAUSE THERE AND AND CAN A SHELV OF THAT FOR A MOMENT THAN WERE GINTO COME BACK TO IT BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT REM SLEEP AR RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP REM SLEEP AND RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP AS I MENTION BEFOUR OCCURS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT BUT YOU'RE GONTO HAVE MORE OF IT A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THESE NINETY MINUTES SLEEP CYCLES IS GOING TO BE COMPRISED OF REMSLEEP AS YOU GET TOWARD MORNING REM SLEEP IS FASCINATING IT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE FIFTIES WHEND A SLEEP LABORATORY AN CHICAGO AM THE RESEARCHES OBSERVE THAT PEOPLE'S EYES WERE MOVING UNDER THEIR EYELIDS NOW SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRAMA LATER IS THAT THE EVE MOVEMENTS ARE NOT JUSTSIDE TOSIDE THEIR VERY ERATIC IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK ANY ONE I NEVER HEARD ANYONE REALLY TALK ABOUT PUBLICLY IS WHY I MOVEMENTS DURING SLEEP I EYES ARE CLOSED AND SOMETIMES FEUPLE'S EYELIDS WIL BE A LITTLE BUT OPEN AND THEIR EYES ARE DARTING ROUND ESPECIALLY LITTLE KIDS ON'T SUGGEST YOU DO THIS OM NIGE MANSURETS ETHICAL BUT IT HAS BEEN DONE WE YOU DON'T PULL BACK THE EYELIDS OF A KID WHILE THEIR SLEEPING AND THEIR EYES ARE KIND OF DARTING ALL OVER THE PLACE THINK PEOPLE DO THIS TO THEIRE PASSED OUT FRIENDS THAT PARTIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO AGAIN I DON'T SUGGEST YOU DO IT BUT A I'M TELL YOU IT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN BUT RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP IS FASCINATING AND OCCURS BE BECAUSE THERE ARE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE BRAINSTEM AN AREA CALLED THE PALNS AN AREAS OF THE PHALYMUS AND THE TOP OF THE BRAINSTEM THAT ARE INVOLVED IN GENERATING MOVEMENTS INDIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SOMETIMES CALLED CICADS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES DURING RAPID IVE MOVEMENTS SLEEP ITS NOT JUSTS RAPID ITS KIND OF A GEITERY SIDE TESIDETHING AND THEN THE EYEBALLS KIND O ROLL IT'S REALLY PRETTY CREEPY TO LOOK AT IF YOU SEE SO WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS THE CIRCUITRY THAT IS INVOLVED IN CONSCIOUS EVE MOVEMENTS IS KIND OF GOING HAY WIRE BUT IT'S NOT HAYWIRE IT'S THESE WAVES OF ACTIVITY FROM THE BRAINSTEM UP TO THE  SO CALLED FALMUS WHICH IS ARY THAT IT'S FILTER SENSORY INFORMITION THAT UP TO THE QUARTEX AND THE CARTEK OF COURSE IS INVOLVED IN CONSCIOUS PERCEPTIONS SO INRAPID IEE MOVEMENT SLEEP THERE CUPLI THINGS ARE HAPPENING BESIDES RAPAND I MOVEMENTS THE MAIN ONES ARE THAT THERE IN CONI SHOULD SAY IN CONTRAST TO SLOWWAVE SLEEP IN REM SLEEP CERATONAN IS ESSENTIALLY ABSENT KISO THIS MOLECULE THIS NROMAGELAYER THAT TENDS TO CREATE THE FEELING OF BLISS AND WELL BEING AND JUST CALM PLACIDITY IS ABSENT  SO THAT'S INTERESTING IN ADDITION TO THAT NOR EPINEFERAN THIS MOLECULE THAT'S INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT AND ALERTNESS IS ABSOLUTLY ABSENT IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW TIMES IN OUR IN OUR LIFE THAT EPINEPERAN IS ESSENTIALLY I AT ZERO ACTIVITY WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AND THAT HAS A NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SORTS OF DREAMING THAT OCCUR DURING REMSLEEP AND THE SORTS OF LEARNING THAT CAN OCCUR IN REMSLEEP AND UNLEARNING FIRST OF ALL IN REM SLEEP WE ARE PARALYZED WE ARE WE ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT'S CALLED ATONIA WHICH JUST MEANS THAT WE'RE COMPLETELY LAID OUT AND PARALYZED WE ALSO TEND TO EXPERIENCE WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE'RE DREAMING ABOUT AS A KIND OF HALLUCINATION ERE A HALLUCINATORY ACTIVITY LONG AGO I LOOKED A INTO HALLUCINATIONS IN DREAMING I WAS JUST FASCINING BY THIS AND IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THERE SOME GREAT BOOKS ON THIS IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN O EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HALLUCINATIONS AND DREAMING O THE M MOST FAMOUS OF WHICH OUR FROMAGUY A RESEARCH R HARVARD AM ALANHOBSON NOW I WROTE A BOOK CALLED A DREAM DRUG STORE AND TALKED ALL ABOUT THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN DRUGS THAT INDUCE HALLUCINATIONS AND DREAMING IN REM S WE CAN EXPLORE THAT IF YOU LIKE SO IN REM OUR EYES ARE MOVING BUT THE REST OF OUR BODY IS PARALYZED AND WE ARE HALLUCINATING THERE'S NO EPINEFRAN AROUND EPINEFRAN DOESN'T JUST CREATE A DESIRE TO MOVE AND ALERTNESS IT IS ALSO THE CHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF FEAR AND ANXIETY IT'S WHAT'S RELEASED FROM OUR DRENAL GLANDS WHEN WE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT'S FEARFUL OR ALERTING SET FACAR SUDDENLY SCREECHES IN FRONT OF US OR WE GET A TROUBLING TEXT MESSAGE A DRENALIN IS DEPLOYED INTO OUR SYSTEM A DRENALIND IS EPINEPRAN THOSE ARE EQUIVALENT MOLECULES AND EPINEPHRON ISN'T JUST RELEASED FROM OUR DREANALS IT'S ALSO RELEASED WITHIN OUR BRAIN SO THERE'S THIS WEIRD STAGE OF OUR LIFE THAT HAPPENS MORE TOWARD MORNING THAT WE CALL REMSLEEP WHERE WEARE HALLUCINATING AND HAVING THESE OUTRAGEOUS EXPERIENCES IN OUR MIND BUT THE CHEMICAL THAT'S A SOCIATED WITH FEAR AND PANIC AN ANXIETY IS NOT AVAILABLE TO US AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ALLOW US ALLOWS US TO EXPERIENCE THINGS BOTH REPLAY OF THINGS THAT DID OCCUR AS WELL AS ELABORATE CONTORTIONS OF THINGS THAT DIDN'T OCCUR AND IT ALLOWS US TO EXPERIENCE THOSE IN THE ABSENCE OF FEAR AND ANXIETY AND THAT IT TURNS OUT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR A JUSTING OUR EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIP TO CHALLENGING THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO US WHILE WE WERE AWAKE THOSE CHALLENGING THINGS CAN SOMETIMES BE IN THE FORM OF SOCIAL ANXIETY OR JUST HAVING BEEN WORKING VERY HARD OR CONCERN ABOUT AN UPCOMING EVENT OR SOMETIMES PEOPLE REPORT FOR INSTANCE DREAMS WHERE THEY FIND THEMSELVES LATE TO AN EXAM OR NAKED IN PUBLIC OR IN A IN SOME SORT OF SITUATION THAT WOULD BE VERY TROUBLING TO THEM AND THAT ALMOST CERTAINLY OCCURS DURING REM SLEEP SO WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE PERIOD OF SLEEP IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCE OF EMOTIONALLY LAID IN EVENTS IS DISSOCIATEDS CHEMICALLY BLOCKED FROM US HAVING THE ACTUAL EMOTION LY IMMEDIATELY SOME OF YOU ARE THINKING BUT WHAT ABOUT NIGHTMARES I HAVE NIGHTMARES AND THOSE CARRY A LOT OF EMOTION ARE SOMETIMES AWAKE UP IN A PANIC LET'S CONSIDER EACH OF THOSE TWO THINGS SEPARATELY BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING REMSLEEP THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT NIGHTMARES ARE OCCURRING DURING SLOW WAV F SLEEP THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME DRUGS THAT I DON'T SUGGEST PEOPLE TAKE IN FACT SO MUCH SO I AM NOT IN O MENTION THEM THAT GIVE PEOPLE VERY AN OBSC ARIER ERE DREAMS IN THIS KIND OF A FEELING THAT O THINGS ARE PURSUING THEM OR THAT ON THEY CAN'T MOVE WHEN THEY ARE BEING CHASED THAT'S I SHAY A COMMON DREAM THAT I'VE HAD I GUESS IT MORE OR LESS A NIGHTMARE THE FEELING THAT ONE IS PARALYZED AND CAN'T MOVE AND IS BEING CHASED LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID OH THAT MUST BE IN REMSLEEP BECAUSE YOURE PARALYZED AND SO YOURE DREAMING ABOUT BEING PARALYZED AND YOU CAN'T MOVE I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FALSE THE RESEARCH SAYS THAT BECAUSE NORAPINEFRAN IS ABSENT DURING REMSLEEP IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT YOU CAN HAVE THESE INTENSE FEARFUL MEMORIES SO THOSE ARE PROBABLY OCCURRING IN SLOW WAVE SLEEP ALTHOUGH THERE MIGHT BE INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE NIGHTMARES IN REMSLEEP THE OTHER THING IS SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY I'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE OF WAKING UP AND FEELING VERY STRESSED ABOUT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT I HAPPEN TO BE THINKING ABOUT OR DREAMING ABOUT IN THE MOMENTS BEFORE AND THAT'S AN INTERESTING CASE OF AN INVASION OF THE DREAM STATE INTO THE WAKING STATE AND THE MOMENT YOU WAKE UP EPINEFRAN IS AVAILABLE SO THE RESEARCH ON THIS IS IN FULLY CRYSTALLYZED BUT MOST OF IT POINTS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE EXPERIENCE OF WAKING UP AND FEELING VERY PANIC MAY BE I WANT A HIGHLIHT MAY BUT MAY BE THAT YOU WERE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING THAT WAS TROUBLING IN THE DAYTIME YOURE REPEATING THAT EXPERIENCE IN YOUR SLEEP APINEFRAN IS NOT AVAILABLE AND THEREFORE THE BRAIN CIRCUITS ASSOCIATED WITH FEAR AND ANXIETY ARE SHUT OFF AND SO YOU ARE ABLE TO PROCESS THOSE EVENTS AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU WAKE UP AND THERE'S A SURGE OF A DRENTLIN OF EPINEFRAN THAT'S NOW COUPLED TO THAT EXPERIENCE SO NIGHTMARE IS VERY LIKELY IN SLOWWAVE SLEEP AND THAT KIND OF PANIC ON WAKING FROM SOMETHING VERY LIKELY TO BE AN INVASION OF THE THOUGHTS AND IDEAS HOWEVER DISTORTED IN REMSLEEP INVADING THE WAKING STATE IN FACT THAT BRINGS TO MIND SOMETHING THAT I'VE MENTION ONCE BEFORE BUT I WANT TO MENTION AGAIN THIS ATONIA THIS PARALYSIS THAT WE EXPERIENCE DURING SLEEP CAN INVADE THE WAKING STATE MANY PEOPLE REPORT THE EXPERIENCE OF WAKING UP AND BEING PARALYZED THEIRE LEGITIMATELY WAKING UP IT'S NOT A DREAM WAKING UP AND BEING PARALYED AND IT IS TERIFYING I'VE HAD THIS HAPPENED BEFORE IT IS I CAN TELL YOU TERIFYING TO BE WIDE AWAKE AND AS FAR AS I COULD TELL FULLY CONSCIOUS BUT UNABLE TO MOVE AND THEN GENERALLY YOU CANJOLT YOURSELF OUT OF IT IN A FEW SECONDS BUT IT IS QUITE FRIGHTENING NOW SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE WAKING UP BEING FULLY PARALYZED AND HALLUCINATING AND THERE IS A THEORY IN THE ACADEMIC AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AT LEAST THAT WHAT PEOPLE REPORT AS ALIEN OBDUCTIONS HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF COOR CHARACTERISTIC THAT MAP QUITE CLOSELY EARLY SIMILARLY TO THESE EXPERIENCES LOT OF REPORTS OF ALIEN DUCTION INVOLVE PEOPLE BEING UNABLE TO MOVE SEEING PARTICULAR FACE IS A HALLUSCINATING EXTENSIVELY FEELING THAT THEIR BODY IS FLOATING OR THEY WERE TRANSPORTED THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE EXPERIENCE OF INVASION OF ATONIA INTO THE WAKING STATE WAKING UP AND STILL BEING PARALYZED AS WELL AS THE HALLUCINATIONS THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF DREAMING AND REM SLEEP NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT A PEOPLES ALIEN OBDUCTIONS WERE NOT LEGITIMATE ALIEN OBDUCTIONS HOW COULD I I WASN'T THERE M AND IF I WAS THERE I WOULDN'T TELL YOU CAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE ME AN ALIEN OM AND I WOULN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW BUT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THESE THINGS AND THEY ARE AN INVASION OF THE SLEEP STATE INTO THE WAKING STATE AND THEY CAN LAST SEVERAL MINUTES OR LONGER AND BECAUSE IN DREAMS SPACE AND TIME ARE DISTORTED OURE PERCEPTION OF THESE EVENTS COULD BE THAT THEY LASTED MANY HOURS AND WE CAN RELY FEEL AS IF THEY LASTED MANY HOURS WHEN IN FACT THEY TOOK ONLY MOMENTS AND WEREGAN A RETURN TO DISTORTION OF SPACE AND TIME IN L BIT SO TO JUST RECAP WHERE WE'VE GONE SO FAR SLOW WAY SLEEP EARLY IN THE NIGHT BEEN OWN TO BE IMPORTANT FOR MOTOR LEARNING AND FOR DETAIL LEARNING REM SLEEP HAS A CERTAIN DREAM COMPONENT WHEN WHICH THERE'S NO EPINEFERON THEREFORE WE CAN'T EXPERIENCE ANXIETY WE ARE PARALYZED THOSE DREAMS TEND TO BE REALLY VIVID AND HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL TO THEM AND YET IN REM SLEEP WHAT'S VERY CLEAR IS THAT THE SORTS OF LEARNING THAT HAPPEN IN REM SLEEP ARE NOT MOTOR EVENTS IT'S MORE ABOUT UNLEARNING OF EMOTIONAL EVENTS AND NOW WE KNOW WHY BECAUSE THE CHEMICALS AVAILABLE FOR REALLY FEELING THOSE EMOTIONS ARE NOT PRESENT NOW THAT HAS VERY IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS SO LET'S ADDRESS THOSE IMPLICATIONS FROM TWO SIDES FIRST OF ALL WE SHOULD ASK WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T GET ENOUGH REM SLEEP AND A SCENARIO THAT HAPPENS A LOT WHERE PEOPLE DON'T GET ENOUGH REM SLEEP IS THE FOLLOWING I'LL JUST EXPLAIN THE ONE THAT A UNFAMILIAR WITH CAUSE IT HAPPENS TO ME A LOT ALTHOUGH I'VE FIGURED OUT WAVES TO ADJUST I GO TO SLEEP AROUND TEN THIRTY ELEVEN O'CLOCK I'VE FALL ASLEEP VERY EASILY AND THEN I WAKE UP AROUND THREE OR FOUR I M I NOW KNOW TO USE A ANESTIARANON SLEEP DEEP REAST PROTOCAL AND THAT ALLOWS ME TO FALL BACK ASLEEP EVEN THOUGSH CALLED NON SLEEP DEEP REST ITS REALLY ALLOWS ME TO RELAX MY BODY IN BRAIN AND I TEND TO FALL BACK ASLEEP AND SLEEP TILL ABOUT SEVEN A M DURING WHICH TIME I GET A LOT OF REM SLEEP AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE MEASURED IT AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE MY DREAMS TEND TO BE VERY INTENTS UM OF THE SORT THAT WE KNOW AS TYPICAL OF REM SLEEP IN THIS SCENARIO I'VE GOT IN MY SLOW AVE SLEEP EARLY IN THE NIGHT AND I'VE GOT MY REM SLEEP TOWARD MORNING HOWEVER THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I DON'T GO BACK TO SLEEP MAY BE HAVE OF FLIGHT TO CATCH THAT'S HAPPEN SOMETIMES I'VE GOT A LOT ON MY MIND AND I DON'T GO BACK TO SLEEP I CAN TELL YOU AND YOU'VE PROBABLY EXPERIENCE THAT THE LACK OF REM SLEEP TENDS TO MAKE PEOPL L EMOTIONALLY IRRITABLE IT TENDS TO MAKE US FEEL AS IF THE LITTLE THINGS ARE THE BIG THINGS SO IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM LABORATORY STUDIES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED SELECTIVELY OF REM SLEEP THAT OUR EMOTIONALITY TENDS TO GET A LITTLE BIT UNHINGED AND WE TEND TO CATASTROPHISE SMALL THINGS WE TEND TO FEEL LIKE THE WORLD IS REALLY DAUNTING WERE NEVER GOING TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE WAYS THAT WE WANT WE CAN'T UNLEARN THE EMOTIONAL COMPONENTS OF WHATEVER IT IS BEEN HAPPENING EVEN IF IT'S NOT TRAMATIC THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENS IN REM SLEEP IS A REPLAY OF CERTAIN TYPES OF SPACIAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE AND WHY WE WERE IN THOSE PLACES AND THIS MAPS TO SOME BEAUTIFUL DATA AND STUDIES THAT WERE INITIATED BY GANING MAT WILSON AT EMITEE YEARS AGO SHOWING THAT IN RODENCE AND IT TURNS OUT IN OTHER NON HUMAN PRIMATES AND INHUMANS THERE'S A REPLAY OF SPACIAL INFORMATION DURING REM SLEEP THAT ALMOST PRECISELY MAPS TO THE ACTIVITY THAT WE EXPERIENCE DURING THE DAY AS WE MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER SO HERE'S A COMMON WORLD CENARIO YOU GO TO A NEW PLACE YOU NAVIGATE THROUGH THAT CITY OR THAT INVIRONMENT THIS PLACE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YUAT THE SCALE OF A CITY IT CAN BE A NEW BUILDING CAN BE OF FINDING PARTICULAR ROOMS NEW SOCIAL INTERACTION YOU EXPERIENCE THAT AND IF IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT BECOMES SOLIDIFIED A FEW DAYS LATER AND YOU WON'T FORGET IT IF IT'S UNIMPORTANT YOU PROBABLY FORGET IT DURING REM SLEEP THERE'S AN IT IS A LITERAL REPLAY OF THE EXACT FIRING OF THE NURANS THAT OCCURRED WHILE YOU WERE NAVIGATING THAT SAME CITY YOU'RE BUILDING EARLIER SO REM SLEEP SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE THE GENERATION OF THIS DETAILED SPACIAL INFORMATION BUT WHAT IS IT THAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN REM SLEEP SO THERE'S THIS UNCOUPLING OF A MOTION BUT MOST OF ALL WHAT'S HAPPENING IN REM SLEEP IS THAT WE'RE FORMING A RELATIONSHIP WITH PARTICULAR RULES OR ALGARITHMS WERE STARTING TO FIGURE OUT BASED ON ALL THE EXPERIENCE THT WE HAD DURING THE DAY WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IMPORTNT THAT WE AVOID CERTAIN PEOPLE OR THAT WE APPROACH CERTAIN PEOPLE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S INPORTANT THAT OM YOU KNOW WHEN WE ENTER A BUILDING THAT WE GO INTO THE ELEVATER AND OM TURN LEFT WHERE THE BATHROOM IS FOR INSTANCE THESE GENERAL THEMES OF THINGS AND LOCATIONS AND HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER AND THAT HAS A WORD IT'S CALLED MEANING DURING OUR DAY WERE EXPERIENCING ALL SORTS OF THINGS MEANING IS HOW WE EACH INDIVIDUALLY PIECE TOGETHER THE RELEVANTS OF ONE THING TO THE NEXT RIGHT SO IF I SUDDENLY A TOLD YOU THAT O YOU KNOW THIS PEN WAS DOWNLOADING ALL THE INFORMATION TO MY BRAIN THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO DELIVER THIS INFORMATION YOU'D PROBALLY THINK I WAS OF PRETTY STRANGE CHARACTER BECAUSE TYPICALLY WE DON'T THINK OF PENS AS DOWNLOADING INFORMATION INTO BRAINS BUT IF I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS GETTING INFORMATION FROM MY COMPUTER THAT WAS ALLOWING ME TO O SAY THINGS O TO YOU YOU'D SAY WIT THAT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A CLEAR AND AGREED UPON ASSOCIATION WITH COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION AND MEMORY AM AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME ASSOCIATION WITH PENDS YOU MIGHT SAY WELL DU BUT SOMETHING IN OUR BRAIN NEEDS TO SOLIDIFY THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS DON'T EXIST AND IT APPEARS THAT REMSLEEP IS IMPORTANT FOR THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU DEPRIVE YOURSELF OR PEOPLE OF REM THEY START SEEING ODD ASSOCIATIONS THEY TEND TO LUMP OR BATCH THINGS I KNOW THIS UM FOR MY OWN EXPERIENCE IF IAVE EVER BEEN SLEEP DEPRIVED WHICH UNFORTUNATLY HAPPENS TOO OFTEN BECAUSE OF A I'M TERRIBLE WITH DEAD LINES TO PULL IN ALL NIGHT ARE THE WORD THU STARTS TO LOOK LIKE IT SPELLED IN CORRECTLY AND THUS A VERY SIMPLE WORD TO SPELL BUT THINGS START TO LOOKA LE DISTORTED AND WE KNOW THAT IF PEOPLE ARE DEPRIVED OF REM SLEEP FOR VERY LONG PAIRDS OF TIME THEY START HALLUCINATING THEY LITERALLY START SEEING RELATIONSHIPS AND MOVEMENT OF OBJECTS THAT ISN'T HAPPENING AND SO REM SLEEP IS REALLY WHERE WE ESTABLISH THE EMOTIONAL LOAD BUT WHERE WE ALSO START DISCARDING OF ALL THE MEANINGS THAT ARE IRRELEVANT AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT EMOTIONALITY A LOT OF OVEREMOTIONALITY OR CATASTROPHIZING IS ABOUT SEEING PROBLEMS EVERYWHERE AND YOU COULD IMAGINE WHY THAT MIGHT OCCUR IF YOU START LINKING THE WEB OF YOUR EXPERIENCE TOO EXTENSIVELY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO HAVE HEALTHY EMOTIONAL AND COGNIVE FUNCTIONING THAT WE HAVE FAIRLY NARROW CHANNELS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL THINGS IF WE SEE SOMETHING ON THE NEWS THAT'S VERY TROUBLING WELL THEN IT MAKE SENSE TO BE VERY TROUBLED BUT IF WE'RE TROUBLED BY EVERYTHING AND WE START JUST SAYING WEU KNOW EVERYTHING IS BOTHERING ME AN UNFEELING HIGHLY IRRITABLE AND EVERYTHINGIS JO DISTORTING AND TROUBLING ME CHANCES ARE WE ARE NOT ACTIVELY REMOVING THAT THE MEANING THE CONECTIVITY BETWEEN LIFE EXPERIENCES AS WELL AS WE COULD AND THAT ALMOST ALWAYS MAPS BACK TO A DEFIS IT IN REMSLEEP SO REM SLEEP IS POWERFUL AND HAS THIS AMAZING CAPACITY TO ELIMINATE THE MEANINGS THAT DON'T MATTER IT'S NOT THAT IT EXACERBATES THE MEANINGS THAT DO MATTER BUT IT ELIMINATES THE MEANINGS THAT DON'T MATTER AND THAT BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT HAPPENS EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT THIS ISN'T A DISCUSSION ABOUT EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT BUT EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT THE REASON A BABY CAM'P GENERATE CORDINATED MOVEMENTS AND THE REASON WHY CHILDRENT CAN GET VERY EMOTIONAL ABOUT WHAT SEEMS LIKE TRIVIAL EVENTS ARE WHAT ADULTS KNOW TO BE TRIVIAL EVENTS LIKE AH THE ICE CREAM SHOP IS CLOSED AND THEY JUST CUT IN THEN THE KID JUST DISSOLVES INTO YOU KNOW A PUDDLE OF TEARS AND THE PARENTS CANOCE WELL IT'LL BE OPEN AGAIN ANOTHER TIME THEY CHILDREN ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY CAN'T GENERATE CORDINATED MOVEMENT OR PLACE THAT EVENT OF THE ICE CREAM SHOP BEING CLOSED INTOO A LARGER CONTEXT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MUCH CONECTIVITY AND MUCH OF THE MATURATION OF THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT BRINGS US TO THE POINT OF BEING EMOTIONALLY STABLE REASONABLE RATIONAL HUMAN BEINGS IS ABOUT ELIMINATION OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THINGS SO REM SLEEP SEEMS TO BE WHERE WE UNCOUPLE L THE POTENTIAL FOR EMOTIONALITY BETWEEN VARIOUS EXPERIENCES AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP AND SIMILARITY OF REM SLEEP TO SOME OF THE CLINICAL PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE EMOTIONALITY AND HELP PEOPLE MOVE THROUGH TRAMA AND OTHER TROUBLING EXPERIENCES WHETHER NOT THOSE TROUBLING EXPERIENCES ARE A DEATH IN THE FAMILIER OF A CLOSE LOVED ONE SOMETHING TERRIBLE THAT HAPPENED TO YOU OR SOMEBODY ELSE OR YOU KNOW AN ENTIRE CHILDHOOD OR SOME EVENT THAT IN YOUR MIND AND WHTY IS FELT AS IN EXPERIENCED AS BAD TERRIBLE OR CONCERNING MANY OF YOU PERHAPS HAVE HEARD OF TRAMA TREATMENT SUCH AS E M D ARE IVE MOVEMENT DESENSESATION REPROCESSING OR KEDEMNE TREATMENT FOR TRAMA SOMETHING THAT RECENTLY BECAME LEGAL AND IS IN FAIRLY WIDESPREAD CLINICAL USE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH E M DI AR AN KEDAMINE AT KIND OF A COOR LEVEL BEARE VERY SIMILAR FEATURES TO REMSLEEP SO LETS TALK ABOUT I M DI AR FIRST E M DIAR I MOVEMENT TOSENSESATION REPROCESSING SOMETHING THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST FRIENZY IN CHIPIRO JACKSO WAS IN PALWALTO AM AND THE STORY GOES THAT SHE WAS WALKING NOTSO INCIDENTALI IN THE TREES AND FORESTS BEHIND STAMFORD AND SHE WAS RECALLING A TROUBLING EVENT IN HER OWN MINDS THIS WOULD BE FROM HER OWN LIFE AND SHE REALIZED THAT ASHE WAS WALKING THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF THAT EXPERIENCE WAS NOT AS INTENTS OR SEVERE SHE EXTRAPOLATED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE OF WALKING AND NOT FEELING AS STRESSED ABOUT THE STRESSFUL EVENT TO A PRACTICE THAT SHE PUT INTO WORK IN WITH HER CLIENTS WITH HER PATIENTS AND THAT NOW HAS BECOME FAIRLY WIDESPREAD TASHE ONE THE FEW BEHAVIORLY THE BEHAVIOR TREATMENTS THAT ARE APPROVED BY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRAMA WHAT SHE HAD HER CLINTS IMPATIENCS DO WAS MOVED THEIR EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHILE RECOUNTING SOME TRAMATIC OR TROUBLING EVENT NOW THIS WAS OF COURSE IN THE CLINIC AND I'M GUESSING THAT SHE REMOVED THE WALKING COMPONENT AND JUST TOOK THE YE MOVEMENT COMPONENT TO THE CLINIC BECAUSE AWHILE IT WOULD BE NICE TO GO ON THERAPECESSIONS WITH YOUR THERAPIS AND TAKE WALKS IT HAS THEIR CERTAIN A BOUNDARIES TO THAT  SUCH AS A CONFIDENTIALITY ENOUGH THEIR LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE PERSON MIGHT NOT FEEL AS OPEN TO DISCUSSING THINGS OR WEATHER BARRIERS AND THINGS LIKE A YUN OF ITS RAINING OR HAILING OUTSIDE IT GETS TOUGH TO DO WHY I MOVEMENTS WELL SHE NEVER REALLY SAID WHY I MOVEMENTS BUT AM SOON I'LL TELL YOU WHY THE DECISION TO SELECT THESE LATERALIZED EY MOVEMENTS FOR THE WORK IN THE CLINIC WAS THE RIGHT ONE SO THESE EY MOVEMENTS THEY LOOK SILLY A I'LL DO THEM BECAUSE I THAT'S WHY I'M HERE A THEY LOOK SILLY BUT THEY BASICALLY INVOLVED SITTING IN A CHAIR AND MOVING ONE'S EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE NOT WHILL TALKING BUT YOU KNOW FOR ME YOU KNOW AND THEN RECOUNTING THE EVENTS SO IT SOMETIMES TALKING WHILE MOVING THE EYES BUT USUALLY WAS MOVING THE EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR THIRTY SIXTY SECONDS THEN DESCRIBING THIS CHALLENGING PROCEDURE NO AS A VISION SCIENTIS WHO ALSO WORKS ON STRESS WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS I THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY FRANKLY A PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME ABOUT  M DAR AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT'S CRAZY I WENT AND LOOKED UP SOME OF THE THEORIES ABOUT WYY M DIAR MIHT WORK AND THERE WERE A BUNCH OF THEORIES OH IT MMIXED THE EY MOVEMENTS DURING REM SLEEP THAT WAS ONE TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY THE OTHER ONE WAS OH IT SYNCRONIZES THAT THE ACTIVITY ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE BRAIN WEN ALL SORT OF I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK INTO BOTH SIDES OF THE BINOCULAR VISUAL FIELD YOU ACTUIV THE VISUAL QUARTEKS BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA OF SYNCRINY BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE BRAIN AS SOMETHING THAT I THINK MODERN NERO SCIENCE IS STARTING TO A LESS YOU SAY A GENTLY ORE NOT SO GENTLY A MOVE AWAY FROM THIS WHOLE RIGHT BRIN A LEFT BRAIN BUSINESS TURNS OUT HOWEVER THAT IY MOVEMENTS OF THE SORT THAT I JUST DID AND THAT FRENCING CHUPERO TOOK FROM THIS WALK EXPERIENCE AND BROUGHT TO THE HER CLIENCE IN IN THE A CLINIC ARE THE SORTS OF EYE MOVEMENTS THAT YOU GENERATE WHENEVER YOUR MOVING THROUGH SPACE WHEN YOU ARE SELF GENERATING THAT MOVEMENT SO NOT SO MUCH WHENYOU'RE DRIVING A CAR BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU WERE RIDING A BICYCLE OR YOU WERE WALKING OR YOU WERE RUNNING YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT BUT YOU HAVE THESE REFLECTS IVE SUBCONSCIOUS EYE MOVEMENTS THAT GO FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOTOR SYSTEMS WHEN YOU MOVE FORWARD YOUR IYE GO LIKE THIS THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES SHOWING THAT THESE LATERALIZED I MOVEMENTS HELPED PEOPLE MOVE THROUGH OR DISSOCIATE THE EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE OF PARTICULAR TRAMAS WITH THOSE EXPERIENCES SUCH THAT THEY COULD REA RECALL THOSE EXPERIENCES AFTER THE TREATMENT AND NOT FEEL STRESSED ABOUT THEM OR THEY DIDN'T REPORT THEM AS DRAMATIC ANY LONGER NOW THE SUCCESSOR IT WASN'T A HUNDRED PER CENT BUT THEY WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN A NUMBER OF STUDIES AND YET THERE STILL SOME CRITICS OF  M DIAR AND FRANKLY FOR A LONG TIME I I STILL THOUGHT WELL I DON'T KNOW THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE KIND OF A HACKAT YUT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF A TISIS SOMETHING T FOR WHICH WE DON'T KNOW THE MECHANISM WHEN WE CAN'T EXPLAIN BUT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THEREHAV BEEN NO FEWER THEN FIVE AND THERE'S A SIXTH ON THE WAY HIGH QUALITY PURE REVIEWED MANUSCRIPTS PUBLISHED IN JOURNAL OF NERO SCIENCE NURON SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL NATURE EXCELLENT JOURNAL THESE ARE VERY STRINGENT JOURNALS AND AND PAPERS SHOWING THAT LATERALIYED EY MOVEMENTS OF THE SORT THAT I JUST DID AND IF YOU'RE JUST LISTENING TO THIS IS JUST SWEET THAT MOVING THE EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE WITH EYES OPEN THAT THOSE EYE MOVEMENTS BUT NOT VERTICAL EYE MOVEMENTS SUPPRESS THE ACTIVITY OF THE EMIGDULA WHICH IS THIS BRAIN REGION THAT IS INVOLVED IN THREAT DETECTION STRESS ANXIETY AND FEAR THERE SOME FORMS OF FEAR THAT ARE NOT A MIGALA DEPENDENT BUT THE EMIGDULA IT'S NOT A FEAR CENTER BUT IT IS CRITICAL FOR THE FEAR RESPONSE AND FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF ANXIETY SO THAT'S INTERESTING WE'VE GOT A CLINICAL TOOL NOW THAT INDEED SHOWS A LOT OF SUCCESS IN A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHERE I MOVEMENTS FROM SIDE TO SIDE ARE SUPPRESSING THE EMIGDULA AND THE GENERAL THEME IS TO USE THOSE EYE MOVEMENTS TO SUPPRESS THE FEAR RESPONSE AND THEN TO RECOUNT OR REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE AN OVER TIME UNCOUPLE THE HEAVY EMOTIONAL LOAD THE SADNESS THE DEPRESSION THE ANXIETY THE FEAR FROM WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAPPEND THAT WAS DRAMATIC THIS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TELL SOMEBODY WHO HAD A TRAMADIC EXPERIENCE THAT THEY WOULD FORGET THAT EXPERIENCE BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU NEVER FORGET THE TRAMATIC EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU REMOVE THE EMOTIONAL LOAD EVENTUALLY IT REALLY DOES LOSE ITS POTENCY THE EMOTIONAL POTENCY IS ALLEVIATED NOW E M DIAR SHOULD JUST MENTION TENDS TO BE MOST SUCCESSFUL FOR SINGLE EVENT OR VERY SPECIFIC KINDS OF TRAMA THAT HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AS SUPPOSE TO SAY AN ENTIRE CHILDHOOD OR AN ENTIRE DEVORSE IT THEY TEND TO BE A IT TENDS TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR SINGLE EVENT KINDS OF THINGS CARCRASHIS ET CETERA WHERE PEOPLE CAN REALLY RECALL THE EVENTS IN QUITE A LOT OF D TAIL SO IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY AND IT SHOULD BE DONE OF IF IT'S GOING TO BE DONE FOR TRAMA IT SHOULD BE DONE IN A CLINICAL SETTING WITH SOMEBODY WHOSE A CERTIFIED TO DO THIS BUT THAT BEARS A LOT OF RESEMBLANCE TO REMSLEEP RIGHT THIS EXPERIENCE IN OUR SLEEP WHERE OUR EYES ARE MOVEMENT MOVING EXCUSE ME ALTHOUGH IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE CHEMICAL AN EPINEPRON IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE FEAR RESPONSE AND YET WERE REMEMBERING THE EVENT FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY OR DAYS SOMETIMES IN REMSLEEP WE THING ABOUT THINGS HAPPEN A LONG LONG TIME AGO SO THAT'S INTERESTING AND THEN NOW THERE'S THIS NEW TREATMENT THIS CHEMICAL TREATMENT WITH THE DRUG KEDEMINE WHICH ALSO BEARS A LOT OF RESEMBLANCE TO THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN REMSLEEP KEDEMINE IS GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION NOW AND I THINK AT LOT OF HE WULD DON'T REALIZE WHAT KEDEMINE IS KEDEMINE IS A DISSOCIATIVE AN ESTHETIC IT IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE DRUG CALLED PC P WHICH IS CERTAINLY A HAZARDOUS DRUG FOR PEOPLE TO USE KEDEMINE AND PC P BOTH FUNCTION TO DISRUPT THE ACTIVITY OF A PARTICULAR RECEPTOR IN THE BRAIN CALLED THE N M D A RECEPTOR N METHEL DE ESPARTY RECEPTOR THIS IS A RECEPTOR THAT'S IN THE SURFACE OF NURANS ARE ON THE SURFACE OF NURANS FOR WHICH MOST OF THE TIME IT'S NOT ACTIVE BUT WHEN SOMETHING VERY EXTREME HAPPENS AND THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE NURRL PATHWAY THAT INPINGES ON THAT RECEPTOR IT OPENS AND IT ALLOWS THE ENTRY OF MULECULES IONS THAT TRIGGER A CELLAR PROCESS THAT WE CALL LONG TERN POTENTIATION AND LONG TURN PETENTIATION TRANSLATES TO A CHANGE IN CONACTIVITY SO THAT LATER YOU DON'T NEED THAT INTENSE EVENT FOR THE SA FOR THE NURAN TO BECOME ACTIVE AGAIN LET ME CLARIFY A LOWBIT OF THIS THE ENEMDY A RECEPTOR IS GAITED BY INTENSE EXPERIENCE ONE WAY U YOU COULD THINK ABOUT THIS IS TYPICALLY I WALK IN MY HOME I MIGHT MAKE SOME FOOD AND SIT DOWN AT MY KITCHEN TABLE AND I DON'T THINK ANYTHING ABOUT A EXPLOSIONS BUT WERE I TO COME HOME ONE NIGHT SIT DOWN TO A BULL OF CHICKEN SOUP AND THERE WAS A MASSIVE EXPLOSION THE NURONS THEIR ASSOCIATE WITH CHICKEN SOUP IN MY KITCHEN TABLE WOULD BE ACTIVE IN A WAY THAT WAS DIFFERENT THAN THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY AND WOULL BE COUPLED TO THIS EXPERIENCE OF EXPLOSIONS SUCH THAT THE NEXT TIME AND PERHAPS EVERY OTHER TIME THAT I GO TO SIT DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE NO MATTER HOW RATIONAL I AM ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THAT EXPLOSION MAYBE AT AS A GAS TRUCK THAT WAS DOWN THE ROAD AND THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK IT'S THERE TO DAY BUT I WOULD HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE THOSE NURONS WOULL BECOME ACTIVE AN I GET AN INCREASE IN HEARTRATE AGAIN INCREASE IN SWEATING ET CETERA KEDEMINE BLOCKS THIS ENEMDY A RECEPTOR AND PREVENTS THAT CROSSOVER AND THE EDDITION OF MEANING TO THE KITCHEN TABLE KITCHEN SOUP A EXCUSE ME CHICKEN SOUP EXPLOSION EXPERIENCE SO HOW IS KEDEMINE BEING USED KEDEMINE IS BEING USED TO PREVENT LEARNING OF EMOTIONS VERY SOON AFTER TRAMA SO KEDEMINE IS BEING STOCKED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EMERGENCY ROOMS WHERE IF PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT IN QUICKLY AND IN O THESE ARE HARD TO DESCRIBE EVEN BUT YOU KNOW A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY SEEING A LOVED ONE NEXT TO THEM KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND THEY WERE DRIVING THAT CAR THIS IS IN FOR EVERYBODY OF CERTAINLY YOU NEED TO TALK TO YOUR PHYSICION BUT KEDEMINE IS BEING USED SO THEY MIGHT INFUSE SOMEBODY WITH KEDEMINE SO THAT THEIR EMOTION IS IT CAN STILL OCCUR BUT THAT THE THAT THE PLASTICITY THE CHANGE IN THE WIRING OF THEIR BRAIN WON'T ALLOW THAT INTENSE EMOTION TO BE ATTACHED TO THE EXPERIENCE NOW IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SORT OF ETHICAL IMPLICATCHIENS OF THIS RIGHT BECAUSE CERTAIN EMOTIONS NEED TO BE COUPLED TO EXPERIENCES I'M NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE USIN KEDEMINE OR SHOULDN'T BE USING KETEMEAN CERTAINLY NOT RECREATIONALLY IT'S QUITE DANGEROUS A IT DOES IT CAN BE LEEFUL AND LIKE PIEC P IT CAN CAUSE PRETTY DRAMATIC CHANGES IN PERCEPTION AN BEHAVIOR BUT IN THE CLINICAL SETTING THE BASIS OF KEDEMINE ASSISTED THERAPIECE ARES REALLY TO REMOVE EMOTION AND I I THINK THE WAY OF BEEN HEARING ABOUT IT TALKED IN ABOUT IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK ITS ELOBIT MORE LIKE THE KIND OF SYLISIBEN TRIALS OR THE EMDIMA TRIALS WHERE ITS ABOUT BECOMING MORE EMOTIONAL OR GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A CERTAIN EXPERIENCE CHEDEMINE IS ABOUT BECOMING DISOCIATIVE OR REMOVED FROM THE EMOTIONAL COMPONET OF EXPERIENCE SO NOW WE HAVE CHEDAMINE WHICH CHEMICALLY BLOCKS PLASTICITY AND PREVENTS THAT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN AN EMOTION AND IN EXPERIENCE THAT'S A PHARMICOLOGIC IN EVENTE WE HAV E MDIARE WHICH IS THIS I MOVEMENT THING THAT IS DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE IMIGDULA AND IS DESIGNED TO REMOVE EMOTIONALITY WHILE SOMEBODY RECOUNTS IN EXPERIENCE AND WE HAVE REMSLEEP WHERE THE CHEMICAL EPINEFRAN THAT ALLOWS FOR SIGNALING OF INTENSE EMOTION TO AND THE EXPERIENCE OF A TENDS EMOTION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY IS NOT ALLOWED AND SO WEARE STARTING TO SEE A ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC WHICH IS THAT A CERTAIN COMPONENT OF OUR SLEEPING LIFE IS ACTING LIKE THEROPY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT REM SLEEP IS ABOUT SO WE SHOULD REALLY THINK ABOUT REMSLEEP AND SLOWWAVE SLEEP AS BOTH CRITICAL SLOW AV SLEEP FOR MOTOR LEARNING AND DETAILED LEARNING REMSLEEP FOR ATTACHING OF EMOTIONS TO PARTICULAR EXPERIENCES AND THEN FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE EMOTIONS ARE NOT ATTACHED TO THE WRONG EXPERIENCES AND FOR UNLEARNING EMOTIONAL RESPONSES IF THEY'RE TOO INTENSE OR SEVERE AND THIS ALL SPEAKS TO THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF MASTERING ONE SLEEP SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN EPISODE TO OF THE PODCAST AND MAKING SURE THAT IF LIFE HAS DESRUPTIVE EVENTS EITHER DO TO TRAVEL OR STRESS OR AM CHANGES IN SCHOOL ORS OR FOOD SCHADUAL SOMETHINGTHAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN EPISODES THREE AND FOUR THAT ONE CAN STILL GRAB AHOLD AND MANAGE ONE SLEEP LIFE BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY THE UNLEARNING OF EMOTIONS THAT ARE TROUBLING TO US IS WHAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD IN LIFE AND INDEED THE REM DEPRIVATION STUDY SHOW THAT PEOPLE BECOME HYPEREMOTIONAL THEY START TO CATASTROPHISE AND IT'S NO SUPPRISE THEREFOR THAT SLEEP DISTURBANCES CORRELATE WITH SO MANY EMOTIONAL IN PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTURBANCES IT'S JUST IT BY NOW IT SHOULD JUST BE OBVIOUS WHY THAT WOULD BE THE CASE IN FACT THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN A DISCUSSION WITH A COLLEGUE OF MIND A WHOS DOWN IN AUSTRALIA DOCTOR SARMACKE I'VE KNOWN HER O FOR TWO DECATES NOW FROM THE TIME AS SHE WAS AT OXFORD AND SARA STUDIES AM AMONG OTHER THINGS MENOPAUS IN THE BRAIN AND SHE WAS SAYING THAT A LOT OF THE EMOTIONAL SA EFFECTS OF MENOPAUS ACTUALLY ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE HORMONES THERE BEEN SOME MREALLY NIC STUDY SHOWING THAT THE DISRUPTIONS IN TEMPERATURE REGULATION IN MENOPAUSE MAP TO CHANGES IN SLEEP REGULATION THAT THEN IMPACT EMOTIONALITY AND IN INABILITY TO CORRECTLY ADJUST THE CIRCUITS RELATED TO EMOTIONALITY AND I ENCURAGE YOU TO A LOOK AT HER WORK WILL PROBABLY HAVE OR AS A GUESTED ON THE PODCAST AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE AUSE SHE SO KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES AS WELL AS ISSUES RELATE TO TESTASTRON AND IN AM PEOPLE WITH ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT CROMIZOMAL BACKGROUNDS SO SLEEP DEPRIVATION ISN'T JUST DEPRIVATION OF ENERGY IT'S NOT JUST DEPROVATION OF AMMUN FUNCTION IT IS DEPRIVATION OF SELF INDUCED THERAPY EVERY TIME WE GO TO SLEEP WA SO THESE THINGS LIKE YE M D ARE AND CEDAMING THERAPEES ARE INCLINIC THERAPIES BUT REM SLEEP IS THE ONE THAT YOU ARE GIVING YOURSELF EVERY NIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP WHICH RAISES I THINK THE OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS HOW TO GET AND HOW TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING THE APPROPRIAMOUNT OF REMSLEEP AND SLOWWAY OF SLEEP SO THAT'S WHAT WILL TALK ABOUT NEXT SO HOW SHOULD ONE GO ABOUT GETTING THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF SLOAVE SLEEP AND REM SLEEP AND KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE RIGHT AMOUNT WELL SHORT OF HOOKING YOURSELF UP TO AN E G IT'S GOIN TO BE TOUGH TO GET EXACT MEASUREMENTS OF BRAIN STATES A FROM NIGHT TO NIGHT SOME PEOPLE NOW DAYS ARE USING THINGS LIKE THE ORA RING OR A WHOOP BAND OR SOME OTHER DEVICE TO MEASURE THE QUALITY IN DEPTH AN DURATION OF THEIR SLEEP AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THOSE THOSE DEVICES CAN BE QUITE USEFUL SOME PEOPLE ARE ONLIGATION THEIR SLEEP BY WAY OF WHETHER NOT THEY FEEL RESTED WHETHER R NOT THEY FEEL LIKE THEIR LEARNING AND THEIR GETTING BETTER OR NOT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ONE CAN REALLY DO AND THE FIRST ONE IS MIGHT SURPRISE YOU IN LIGHT OF EVERYTHING I'VE SAID AND PROBABLY EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT SLEEP THERE WAS A STUDY DONE BY A HARVARD UNDERGRADUATE AN ME EMILY HOGLAND AM WHO AS IN ROBERT STRICT GOLD SLAP AT THE TIME AND THAT STUDY IT EXPLORED HOW VARIATIONS IN TOTAL SLEEP TIME RELATED TO LEARNING AS COMPARED TO TOTAL SLEEP TIME ITSELF ND TO SUMMARIZE THE STUDY WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE A REGULAR AMOUNT OF SLEEP EACH NIGHT AS OPPOSED TO THE TOTAL DURATION IN OTHER WORDS AND WHAT THEY SHOWED WAS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN LEARNING OR DEFACISTS IN LEARNING WERE MORE RELATED TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU GOT SIX HOURS SIX HOURS FIVE HOURS SIX HOURS THAT WAS BETTER THAN IF SOMEBODY GOT FOR INSTANCE SIX HOURS TEN HOURS SEVEN HOURS FAR FOR OR FIVE HOURS YOU MIGHT SAY WHILE THAT'S CRAZY BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE'RE JUST ALSO S TO GET MORE SLEEP AND THES MORE REM TOWARDS MORNING TURNS OUT THAT FORSAKE OF LEARNING NEW INFORMATION AND PERFORMANCE ON EXAMS IN PARTICULAR THAT'S WHAT WAS MEASURED LIMITING THE VARIATION IN THE AMOUNT OF YOUR SLEEP IS AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST GETTING MORE SLEEP OVER ALL AND I THINK THIS WILL BR ING PEOPLE GREAT RELIEF MANY PEOPLE GREAT RELIEF WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO QUOTN  GET ENOUGH SLEEP REMEMBER A FEW EPISODES AGO I TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FATIGUE AND IN SOMNIA YOU KNOW FATIGUE IS TENDS TO BE WHEN WE ARE TIRED IN SOMNIA TENDS TO LEAD TO A SLEEPINHESS DURING THE DAY WHEN WE'RE FALLING ASLEEP AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT YOU DON'T WANT EITHER OF THOSE THINGS REALLY BUT I FOUND IT STRIKING THAT THE DATA FROM THI STUDY REALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT CONSISTENTLY GETTING ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF SLEEP IS BETTER THAN JUST GETTING MORE SLEEP AND I THINK NOWADAYS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST AIMING FOR MORE SLEEP AND THEY'RE RATHER TROUBLED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ONLY GETTING FIVE HOURS ARE THEIR ONLY GETTING A SIX HOURS IN SOME CASES IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT THEY ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED AND THEY NEED MORE SLEEP BUT SOME PEOPLE JUST HAVE A LOWER SLEEP NEED AND I FIND GREAT RELIEF PERSONALLY IN THE FACT THAT CONSISTENTLY GETTING FOR ME ABOUT SIX HOURS OR SIX AND A HALF HOURS IS GOING TO BE MORE BENEFICIAL THAN CONSTANTLY STRIVING FOR EIGHT OR NINE AND FINDING THAT SOME NIGHTS I'M GETTING FIVE AND SOMETIMES I'M GETTING NINE AND VARYING AROUND THE MEAN AS I RECALL AND I I THINK HIM CAN GET THIS PRECISELY RIGHT BUT IF NOT I KNOW THAT I'M A AT LEAST CLOSE FOR EVERY HOUR VARIATION IN SLEEP REGARDLESS OF WHETHER N I WAS MORE SLEEP THAN ONE TYPICALLY GOT THERE WAS A SEVENTEEN PER CENT REDUCTION IND PERFORMANCE ON THIS PARTICULAR EXAMTYPE AND SO THIS IS POWERFUL THIS MEANS THAT WE SHOULD STRIVE FOR A REGULAR AMOUNT OF SLEEP AND FOR SOME OF US THAT MEANS FALLING SLEEP AND WAKING UP AND GOING BACK TO SLEEP FOR SOME PEOPLE MEANS FALLING ASLEEP AND WAKING UP AND NOT GETTING BACK TO SLEEP NOW IDEALLY YOU'RE GETTNG THE THE FULL COMPLIMENT OF SLOWWAY SLEEP EARLY IN NIGHT AND SLEEP TOWARD MORNING WHICH IS REMSLEEP WHICH BRINGS US TO HOW TO GET MORE REMSLEEP WELL THERE COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS BUT A'M HERE'S HOW TO NOT GET MORE REMSLEEP I FIRST OF ALL DRINK A LOT OF FLUID RIGHT BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP ONE OF THER REASONS WHY WE WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT TO USE THE BATHROOM IS BECAUSE WHEN OUR BLATDER IS FULL THERE IS A NORAL CONNECTION LITERALLY AND A SET OF NURONS AND A NERVE CIRCUIT THAT GOES TO THE BRAINSTEM THAT WAKES US UP AND A ACTUALLY SOME PEOPLE A THAT I KNOW AND I WON'T BE MENTIONED I SHALL USE THIS TO TRY AND A JUST THAT FOR THEIR JET LAG WHEN THE TRING TOE STAY AWAKE HAVING O USE THE BATH OR HAV ANY URANA IS ONE OF THE MOST ANXIETY EVOKING A EXPERIENCES ANY ONE CAN HAVE IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM IT'S VERY HARD TO FALL ASLEEP OR STAY ASLEEP AND BED WETTING WHICH HAPPENS IN KIDS A VERY EARLY ON IS A FAILURE OF THOSE CIRCUITS TO MATURATE IT TO MATURE UNTILL A MA YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL ASSUME THAT BABIES ARE GOING TO YOU ARE GOING TO PEIN THEIR SLEEP BUT ADULTS AREN'T SPOSED TO DO THAT AND THE A THE CIRCUITS TAKE SOME TIME TO DEVELOPEN AND SOME KIDS THEY DEVELOP AL BUT LATER THAN OTHERS SO HAVING A FULL BLATTER IS ONE WAY TO DIS RUPT YOUR SLEEP YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO BED DEHYDRATED BUT THAT'S ONE WAY UNTHE OTHER HAND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER YOUR DREAMS MORE OR REMEMBER MORE OF YOUR DREAMS THERE IS A TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE I DON'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND IT WHICH IS TO DRINK A BUNCH OF WATER BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU TEND TO BREAK IN AND OUT OF REM SLEEP IT TENDS TO BE FRACTURED AND WITH A SLEEP JOURNAL I THENDONE THESE LABORATORY STUDIES BELIEVE D OR NOT PEOPLE WILL RECALL MORE OF THEIR DREAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THIS CON OF SEMI CONSCIOUS STATE BECAUSE THEIR CONSTANTLY WAKING UP THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT I SUGGEST NOT HAVING A FULL BLATTER BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP THAT ONE'S KIND OF AN OBVIOUS ONE BUT NONE THE LESS THE OTHER ONE IS IF YOU RECALL THAT DURING REM SLEEP WE HAVE A SHIFT IN NERRO TRANSMITTERS SUCH THAT WE HAVE LESS CERATONAN RI DISONE MAY SHRUG OT THEIR RIGHTS GIVES ME LESS CERATONAN THERE ARE A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS OUT THERE GEUR TOWARD IMPROVING SLEEP I'VE TAKEN SOME OF THEM AND OBTAIN MANY OF THEM IF NOT ALL OF THEM AT THIS POINT AM SO I COULD REPORT BACK TO YOU AND I THINK I MENTION ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE THAT WHEN I TAKE TRIP TO FAN OR ANYTHING THAT CONTAINS FIVE AH K P WHICH IS A CERATONAN OR PRECURSERDISE ERATONEN SERTONA IS MADE FROM TRIP TO FAN I TEND TO FALL VERY DEEPLY SLEEP AND THAN WAKE UP A FEW HOURS SLATER AND THAT MAKE SENSE NOW BASED ON THE FACT THAT YOU JUST DON'T WANT A LOT OF REM SLEEP EARLY ON WHAT WAS PROBABLY HAPPENING AS I WAS GETTING A LOT OF REM SLEEP EARLY ON BECAUSE LOW LEVELS OF SERATON AND ARE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND THAT COMES EARLY IN THE NIGHT SO FOR SOME PEOPLE THOSE SUPPLEMENTS MIGHT WORK BUT BEWARE CERATONAN SUPPLEMENTS AT A COULD JISTRUPT THE TIMING OF REM SLEEP AND SLOWWAVE SLEEP AND IN MY CASE LED TO WAKING UP VERY SHORTLY AFTER GOING TO SLEEP AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET BACK TO SLEEP NOW IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR SLOW WAVE SLEEP THAT'S INTERESTING A THERE ALWAYS TO DO THAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WAYS TO INCREASE SLOWWAVE SLEEP THE PERCENTAGE OF SLOWWAVE SLEEP APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY DISRUPTION TO THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF SLEEP AND LEARNING IS TO ENGAGE IN RESISTANCE EXERCISE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT RESISTANCE EXERCISE TRIGGERS AND NUMBER OF METABOLIC AND ENDERCRAN PATHWAYS THAT LEND THEMSELVES TO RELEASE OF GROWTH HORMONE WHICH HAPPENS EARLY IN THE NIGHT AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE THEREFORE CAN INDUCE A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DONE VERY CLOSE TO GOING TO BEDTIME IN FACT FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT THE EXERCISE COAN BE DISRUPTIVE FOR REASONS I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN PREVIOUS EPISODES BUT RESISTANCE EXERCISE UNLIKE AROBIC EXERCISE DOES SEEM TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SLOWWAVE SLEEP WHICH AS WE KNOW IS INVOLVED IN MOTOR LEARNING AND THE ACQUISITION OF FINE DETAILED INFORMATION NOT GENERAL RULES OR THE EMOTIONAL COMPONENTS OF EXPERIENCES FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN LUCID DREAMING AND WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF LUCID DREAMING THAT YOUR EXPERIENCING I HAV THEM MENABLE A TRACT DOWN THAT DEVICE WITH THE RED LIGHT THAT I DESCRIBED AT THE BEGINNING BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF JUST SIMPLE ZERO TECHNOLOGY TOOLS THAT ONE COULD USE IN PRINCIPLE ONE IS TO SET ACUE THE WAY THIS WORKS IS YOU COME UP WITH A SIMPLE STATEMENT AM ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOUD LIKE TO SEE OR EXPERIENCE LATER IN DREAMS AM YOU CAN FOR INSTANCE WRITE DOWN A YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE A I WANT TO REMEMBER THE RED APPLE ANNONT SOUND SILYIN TRIVIAL AND YOU LOOK AT THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT O WRITE IT DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER YOU MIGHT VE ONE O DRAW A RED APPLE AND THEN BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU WOULD LOOK AT IT AND THEN YOU WOULD JUST GO TO SLEEP THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT DOING THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN A ROW CAN LEAD TO A SITUATION IN WHICH YOU ARE SUDDENLY IN YOUR DREAM AND YOU REMEMBER THE RED APPLE AND THAT GIVES YOU A SORT OF TETHER TO REALITY BETWEEN THE DREAM STATE IND REALITY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO NAVIGATE IN SHAPE AND KIND OF ADJUST YOUR DREAMS LUS A DREAMING DOES NOT HAVE TO BE OR INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO ALTER FEATURES OF THE DREAM A YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THINGS IN THE DREAM SOMETIMES ITS JUST THE AWARENESS THAT YOU ARE DREAMING BUT AM NONE THE LESS SOME PEOPLE EN JOY LOSE HE DREAMING AND THEN FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE A LOT OF LOOSE OE DREAMS THAT FEEL KIND OF OVERWHELMED BY THOSE THAT GOING TO INVOLVE TRYING TO A EMBRACE PROTOCOLS THAT CAN SET THE RIGHT DURATION OF SLEEP THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF LITERATURE NOT A LOT THAT THAT SHOWS THAT KEEPING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SLEE A PER NIGHT TO THE BETO SAY SIX HOURS SUCH THAT YOU BEGIN SLEEP AN END AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF ONE OF THESE ALTRADEAN CYCLES A CAN BE BETTER THAN WAKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THESE ULTRADIAN CYCLES SO TRY AND FIND THE WRIGHE AMOUNT OF SLEEP THAT YOU NEED A THAT I'S RIGHT FOR YOU AND THEN TRY ND GET THAT CONSISTENTLY NIGHT TO NIGHT IF YOU ARE LOSE AD DREMER AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEND YOU MAY WANT TO START TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WAKING UP AT THE END OF ONE OF THESE ALTRADEAN CYCLE SO IN THAT IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAKE UP AFTER SIX HOURS THAN AFTER SEVEN AND IF YOU DID SLEEP LONGER THAN SIX HOURS MAY BE DWONE TO GET TO SEVEN AND A HALF HOURS CASASKIN A REFLECT THE END OF ONE OF THESE NINEUMENUTE CYCLES AS SUPPOSED TO WAKING UP IN THE MIDDLE ALCOHOL ALCOHOL AND MAROWANA ARE WELL KNOWN TO INDUCE STATES THAT ARE PSEUDO SLEEP LIKE ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE FALL ASLEEP ON WHILE AFTER HAVING CONSUMED ALCOHOL OR AM T C THE ACT OF COMPONENT ONE OF THE ACTIVE COMPONENTS IN MARIWUANA ALCOHOL TS AND MOST THINGS LIKE THEM MEANING THINGS THAT INCREASE SERETONE AND AM OR GABA ARE GOING TO DISRUPT THE PATTERN OF SLEEP THEYARE GOING TO DESTRUPT THE DEPTH THE'RE GOING TO DESTRUPT THE OVER ALL SEQUENCING OF MORE SLOW WAVE SLEEP EARLY IN THE NIGHT IND WORE REM SLEEP LATER IN THE NIGHT THAT'S JUST THE THE REALITY THE A THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT IT LEAST IN A FEW STUDIES THAT I CO FIND SEEM TO GEST THAT YOU COULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP USING THINGS LIKE ARGENINE THE EMINOACIDEL ARGENINE ALTHOUGH YOU REALLY WANT CHECK ARGING CAN HAVE EFFECTS ON HEART ET CETERA HAS OTHER EFFECTS BUT ALCOHOL TI S NOT CAN BE GREAT FOR SLEEP IN DEPTH OF SLEEP YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP FASTER BUT THE SLEEP THAT YOUR ACCESSING REALLY ISN'T THE KIND OF DEEP RESTORATIVE SLEEP THAT YOU SHOULD BE GETTING OF COURSE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO SLEEP AND THAT'S WITHIN YOUR PROTOCOLS I'VE SAID HERE BEFORE I'M NOT SUGGESTING PEOPLE TAKE ANYTHING O NAUTOMEDICAL DOCTOR I'M NOT A COP SO I'M NOT TURNIN  REGULATE ANY ONE'S BEHAVIOR I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT THE LITERATURE SAYS SOME OF YOU MAY WANT TO EXPLORE YOUR DREAMS AND MEANING OF DREAMS ET CETERA YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF HARD DATA ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE REPORT KEEPING A SLEEP JOURNAL WERE A DREAM JOURNAL CAN BE VERY USEFUL SO THEY MARK WHEN THEY THING THEY FELL ASLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN THEY WOKE UP AND IF THEY WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT EARLY IN THE MORNING THEY'LL JUST WRITE DOWN WHAT THEY CAN RECALL OF THEIR DREAMS AND EVEN IF THEY RECALL NOTHING MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF MIDMORNING OR LATER AFTERNOON THAT SUDDENLY COMES TO THEM THAT THEY HAD A DREAM ABOUT SOMETHING IN WRITING THAT DOWN I KEPT A A DREAM JOURNAL FOR WHILE ITIN REALLY AFFORD ME MUCH I I DIDN'T REALLY LEARN ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT MY DREAMS WERE VERY BAZAAR BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN DREAMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH REM SLEEP AS A COMPARED TO SLOW WAVE SLEEP WHICH CAN TELL YOU WHETHER NOT YOUR DREAM LIKELY HAPPENED IN REMSLEEP OR SLOWWAY OF SLEEP AND THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE T TURNS OUT OF SOMETHING CALLED THEORY OF MIND THEORY OF MIND IS ACTUALLY AN IDEA THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE STUDY AND ASSESSMENT OF AUTISM AND IT WAS A INITIALLY THAT PHRASE THEORY OF MIND WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY AM SIMON BARON COEN WHO IS SACHA BARON COEN THE COMEDIANS BROTHER SIMON BARON COEN IS A SYCHALLOGIST AND A TO SOME EXTENT THE NURO SCIENTIST IN AT OXFORD AND THEORY OF MIND TESTS ARE DONE ON CHILDREN AND THE THEORY OF MONTESCA IS SOME WHAT LIKE THE FALLOWING A A CHILD IS BROUGHT INTO A LABORATORY AND WATCHES A VIDIO OF A CHILD PLAYING WITH SOME SORT OF TOY AND THEN AT THE END OF PLAYING WITH THAT TOY A THEY PUT THE TOY IN A DRAWER AND THEY GO AWAY AND THEN ANOTHER CHILD COMES IN AND IS LOOKING AROUND AND THEN THE EXPERIMENTOR ASKS THE CHILD WHOSE IN THE EXPERIMENT THE REAL CHILD SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THE CHILD THINK YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THEY FEELING AND MOST CHILDREN OF A PARTICULAR AGE FIVE OR SIX OR OLDER WILL SAY OH YOU KNOW HE OR SHE IS CONFUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE TOY IS OR THEY'LL SAY SOMETHING THAT IMPLIES WHAT WE CALL THEORY OF MIND THAT THEY CAN PUT THERE IDEAS INTO AND THEIR MIND INTO WHAT THE OTHER CHILD IS LIKELY TO BE FEELING OR EXPERIENCING THAT'S THEORY OF MIND AND IT TURNS OUT THAT M THIS IS Y USED AS ONE OF THE ASSESSMENTS FOR AUTISM BECAUSE SOME CHILDREN NOT ALL BUT SOME CHILDREN THAT HAVE AUTISMER THAT GO ON TO DEVELOP AUTISM DON'T HAVE THIS THEORY OF MIND THEY TEND TO FIXATE ON THE FACT THAT THE FIRST CHILD PUT THE TOY IN THE DRAWER THEY'LL SAY IT'S IN THE DRAWER AS OPPOSED TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION WHICH IS HOW DOES THE SECOND CHILD FEEL ABOUT IT OR WHAT ARE THEY EXPERIENCING SO THEORY OF MIND IS SOMETHING THAT IS EMERGES EARLY IN LIFE AS A PART OF THE MATURATION OF THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH A EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND WE EXPERIENCE THIS INCERTAIN DREAMS SO IF YOU HAD A DREAM THAT YOUR PUZZLED ABOUT OR THAT YOUR FIXATED ON AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU MIGHT ASK IN THAT DREAM WAS I ASSESSING SOMEBODY ELSE'S EMOTION AND FEELING OR WAS I VERY MUCH IN MY OWN FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE AND THAT THE TENDENCY IS THAT THEORY OF MIND TENDS TO SHOW UP MOST IN THESE REM ASSOCIATED DREAMS OW THIS IS INTO HARD AND FAST RULE BUT CHANCES ARE IF YOU WERE IN A DREAM AND YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO YOU YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT THEIR DESIRE TO CHASE YOU OR HELP YOU OR SOMETHING THAT WAS RERELATE TO SOMEONE ELSE'S EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE IT WAS PROBABLY A REM DREAM THAT DREAM OCCURRED IN RAPIDI MOVEMENT SLEEP AS UPPOSED TO SLOWWAVE OF SLEEP AND THAT MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ROLE OF REM IN EMOTIONAL UNLEARNING OF ASSOCIATIONS WITH PARTICULAR LIFE EVENTS THAT REM IS RICH WITH ALL SORTS OF EXPLORATION OF THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF BEING CHASED OR THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF HAVING TO TAKE AN EXAMN THE NEXT DAY OR BEING LATE FOR SOMETHING BUT AGAIN IF YOUR FIXATED OR YOU CAN RECALL THINKING A LOT ABOUT OR FEELING A LOT ABOUT WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE'S MOTIVATIONS WERE THAN CHANCES ARE IT WAS IN REM AND IF NOT CHANCES ARE IT WAS IN SLOW WAVE OF SLEEP TO DAY WE'VE BEEN IN A DEEP DIVE OF SLEEP AND DREAMING LEARNING AND UNLEARNING AND I JUST WANT A RECAP OF FEW OF THE HIGHLIGHTS AND IMPORTANT POINTS A LOT MORE SLOWWAVE SLEEP IN LESS REM EARLY IN THE NIGHT MORE REM AND LESS SLOWWAVE SLEEP LATER IN THE NIGHT REMSLEEP IS ASSOCIATED WITH IT INTENSE EXPERIENCES WITHOUT THIS CHEMICAL APINEFERON THAT ALLOWS US THE ANXIETY OR FEAR AND ALMOST CERTAINLY HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLL IN UNCOUPLING OF EMOTION FROM EXPERIENCES SELF AN DU THERAPY THAT WE GO INTO EACH NIGHT THAT BEARS STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THINGS LIKE EMDY ARE IN CEDAMINTHERAPES AND SO FORTH SLOWWAVE SLEEP IS CRITICAL HOWEVER ITS CRITICAL MOSTLY FOR MOTOR LEARNING AND THE LEARNING OF SPECIFIC DETAILS A REM IS KIND OF EMOTIONS AND GENERAL THEMES AND MEANING AND SLOWWAVE SLEEP MOTOR LEARNING AND DETAILS I PERSONALLY FIND IT FASCINATING THAT CONSISTE N SEE OF SLEEP MEANING GETTING SIX HOURS EVERY NIGHT IS BETTER THAN GETTING TEN ONE NIGHT EIGHT THE NEXT FIVE THE NEXT FOR THE NEXT I FIND THAT FASTENING AND EAND I THINK I ALSO LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING I CAN CONTROL BETTER THAN JUST TRYING TO SLEEP MORE WHICH I THINK I'M NOT ALONE AND AGREING THAT THAT'S JUST HARD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DO THIS EPISODE ALSO BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION OF A FIVE EPISODE STREEK WHERE WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON SLEEP AND TRANSITIONS IN AND OUT OF SLEEP NON SLEEP DEEP REST WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF TOOLS MORNING LIGHT EVENING LIGHT AVOIDING LIGHTS BLUE BLOCKERS SUPPLEMENTS TOOLS FOR MEASURING SLEEP DURATION AND QUALITY WE'VE BEEN COVERING A LOT OF THEMES I LIKE TO THINK THAT BY NOW YOU'RE ARMED WITH A NUMBER OF TOOLS AND INFORMATION THINGS LIKE KNOWING WHEN YOU'RE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS KNOWING WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT OF YOU LIGHT OR NOT WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO EAT OR TAKE HOT SHOWERS OR GOD FORBID A COLD SHOWER SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING ME MORE LESS LOTH BUT CAN HAVE CERTAIN BENEFITS AND THAT WILL LOW YOU TO SHAPE YOUR SLEEP LIFE AND GET THIS CONSISTENT OR MORE OR LESS CONSISTENT AMOUNT OF SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS NOBODY'S PERFECT FACT I I'VE THIS LITTLE JOKE THAT I SOMETIMES TELL ITS NOT FUNNY LIKE MOST O THE JOKES I TELL I'M TOLD THE'RE NOT FUNNY BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH EXCITEMENT NOW ABOUT INTERMITTANT FASTING SOMETIMES I THINK THAT A SOME ONE SHOULD STARTLING ON INTERMITTENT SLEEP DEPRIVATION ALTHOUGH WE'RE ALREADY DOING THAT WERE WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING LACK OF SLEEP FROM TIME TO TIME AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD CATASTROPHIZE THAT TOO MUCH I THINK THAT WHA WE WANT TO DO RATHER THAN ACCUMULATE A SLEEP ANXIETY IS TOO YOU KNOW IF WE GET A BAD NIGHT SLEEP WE WANT TO ADJUST WE WANT TO GET BACK ON TRACK AND JUST GET THE CONSISTENT AMOUNT OF SLEEP USE THOSE NON SLEEP DEEP REAST PROTOCALLS TO HELP US ORELAX WHEN WE'RE FEELING ANXIOUS OR HAVING TROUBLE WAKEN UP AN MILL THE NIGHT THERE'RE A LOT OF TOOLS OUT THERE AND MOST OF THEM AREZERO COST AND SO I HOPE YOU'LL FIND THOSE BENEFICIAL IF YOU'VE BEEN HEARING COSTELLO SNORING THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE UH I APOLOGIZE IN HIS BEHALF AS I SAID IN THE WELCOME TITIO TO THIS PODCAST HE'SEN INTO RAL PART OF THE PODCAST A FEW PEOPLE HAVE SAID HEY THAT NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND IS REALLY DESRUPTIVE AH HEY WHAT CAN I SAY A COSTELLE IS A TEN YEAR OLD BULLDOG MAST IF A THE LIFE SPEND ON THOSE ANIMALS IS ABOUT TEN YEARS SO UM I MUCH I MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY BUT WON'T YOU KNOW AFTER HE'S GONE THERE WON'T BE ANY SNORING ALTHOUGH PROBABLY GET A DIFFERENT DOG SO UH SORT OF A WHAT WOULD THE COULDSE SORRY NOT SORRY AH SORRY NOT SORRY ABOUT THE SNORING AND I'M SORRY IF IT'S DESRUPTIVE GENUINELY BUT I HE HE'S HERE FOR FOR THE HALL SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ABOUT AS WE CLOSE OUT THIS SEGMENT ON SLEEP WE ARE MOVING INTO A NEW THEME IN TOPIC FOR THE NEXT FORTIFIVE EPISODES WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THE SCIENCE AND THE TOOLS RELATED TO NERROW PLASTICITY NEURO PLASTICITY IS A REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN FACT IT'S THE DEFINING FEATURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS IT'S ABILITY TO CHANGE ITSELF AND RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE THAT IS UNLIKE EVERY OTHER TISSUE AND COLLECTION OF SELLS AND ORGAN IN OUR BODY IT'S REALLY WHAT MAKES US US AS A SPECIES AND 'S WHAT MAKES US US AS INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S REALLY WEAR OUR POTENTIAL LIES EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW EVERYTHING WE CAN DO AND OUR TRUE POTENTIAL IND TERMS OF WHAT WE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO KNOW DO SAY IN LIFE IS SET BY THE LIMITS OF NEURL PLASTICITY SO WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE LEARNING IN CHILDHOOD LEARNING AND ADULTHOOD WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS DETAILED PROTOCALLS AS THEY RELATE TO SENSURY PLASTICITY LEARNING NEW CENSORY INFORMATION VERSES MOTOR PLASTICTY OR SENSORY MOTOR INTIGRATION WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LANGUAGE ACQUISITION WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONAL ACQUISITION AND BREADTH AS WELL AS I THINK A TOPICAL LOT OF PEOPLE R GEN AFINE FASCINATING IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PLASTICITY SET DURING CHILDHOOD ATTACHMENT TO PARENT OR OTHER CAREGIVER AND HOW THAT MAPS ON TO ADULT RELATIONSHIPS NOF THERE'S MANY OF YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT SECURE ATTACH OR INSECURE ATTACH THE A B AN C D AT BABIES AS THE'RE CALLED FROM THE CLASSIC STUDIES OF BULBY AND OTHERS BUT NOW THERE'S I SUAL NEURAL SCIENCE THAT CAN SAY WHICH CIRCUITS WERE ACTIVE DURING THOSE EARLY LIFE ATTACHMENT AND HOW THOSE MAP TO ADULT ATTACHMENT STYLES CHALLENGES AND WHAT MAKES US MORE LIKELY TO SELECT CERTAIN PARTNERS AND STYLES OF ATTACHMENT AS WELL AS HOW TO CHANGE THOSE IT'S REALLY FASCINATING AND I THINK NEURAL SCIENCES TIME HAS CALM FOR NEURL PLASTCITY WE'RE ALSO IN A TOK OF COURSE ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND CHEMICALS AND MACHINES AND DEVICES THAT CAN ASSIST IN SPEEDING UP THE PLASTICITY PROCESS OR BELIEVE OR NOT THERER SOME CASES WHERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO DELAY PLASTICITY IN ORDER TO GET MORE DEPTH OF LEARNING AND HAVE THAT LEARNING LAST LONGER SOMETHING THAT IS JUST ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR LITERATURE SOME VERY EXCITED TO MOVE ON TO THAT TOPIC SOON I HOPE THAT THE TOOLS THAT YOU'VE ACQUIRED SO FAR IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT Y'VE REQUIRED SO FAR AS HELPING YOU WITH YOURSELF I VALUATION AND EXPERMENTATION AS YOU SEE FIT AND IS ALLOWING YOU TO NOT JUST SLEEP BETTER BUT FEEL BETTER WHILE YOUARE AWAKE AND HOPEFULLY AS SET THE STAGE FOR YOU TO LEARN BETTER AS WE START TO MARCHIN TO THE MONTH ON NERL PLASTICITY MANY OF YOU HAVE ASKED HOW YOU CAN HELP SUPPORT THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE PLASTION YOU CAN HELP SUPPORT THE PODCAST BY SUBSCRIBING TO THE UTU CHANNEL IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY AND LEAVING COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENT SECTION IF YOU COULD SUBSCRIBE ON APPLE AND OR SPOTIFY THAT'S HELPFUL AND THERE'S A PLACE ON APPLE PLODCASTS TO LEAVE A RATING AS WELL AS COMMENTS ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE PODCAST IF YOU COULD SUGGEST THE PODCAST TO FRIENDS AND CO WORKERS AND ANYONE ELSE THAT YOU THINK WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE INFORMATION THAT ALSO REALLY HELPS US GET THE WORD OUT AND OF COURSE CHECK OUT OUR SPONSORS BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY DIRECT WAY TO HELP US CONTINUE TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND AS MENTIONED THE BEGINNING OF TODAY'S EPISODE WE ARE NOW PARTNERED WITH MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE THEY MAKE SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS THAT AREOF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY END TEYSHIP INTERNATIONAL IF YOU GO TO LIVE MOMENTOUSTOC CALM SLASH HUBERMEN YOU WILL FIND MANY OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED ON VARIOUS EPISODES OF THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST AND YU WILL FIND VARIOUS PROTOCALS RELATED TO THOSE SUPPLEMENTS LAST BUT NOT LEAST A FEW PEOPLE WROTE TO ME WITH SOME QUESTIONS SLASH CORRECTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT I SAID IN PREVIOUS PODCAST SO IN KEEPING WITH MY GOAL OF MAKING THE INFORMATION ACCURATE AND CLEAR I JUST WANT TO CORRECT MYCELF ABOUT A FEW THINGS THAT I SAID ONE OF THOSE AND I'M GUESSING IT PROBABLY CAME FROM AN END OF CHRONOLOGIST OR SOMEBODY ELSE THAT KNOWS A LOT ABOUT TESTIGALS SAID HUBERMEN YOU MENTION THAT TESTOSTRONE IS MADE BY THE SER TOLY CELLS OF THE TESTES AND IT'S NOT IT'S MADE BY THE LIDIG CELLS OF THE TESTES AND INDEED YOU ARE CORRECT AND SOI WANT TO I MAKE SURE THAT I CLARIFY THAT TESTOSTRONE IS MADE BY THE LIDIG CELLS OF THE TESTES NOT BY THE CERTOLY CELLS THE CERTOLYCELLS MAKE A FIVE OUT FOR REDUCTES AND ROMATS AND SOME OTHER ENZIMES INVOLVED IN CONVERSION OF TESTOSTRON INTO THINGS LIKE THE EIGHH T AN ESTROGEN SO THANK YOU FOR THAT CORRECTION I GENUINELY APPRECIATE IT I MISSPOKE THE OTHER THING I SAID WAS AT ONE POINT I SAID TYPICAL TEMPERATURE IS NINETY SIX POINT EIGHT WHEN I ACTUALLY MEANT TO SAY NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX SO IT WAS A DISLECIC SLIP ON MY PART AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M DISLECIC I KN CLINICALLY DIAGNOSE WITH THE SIESKI BUT I SWAP THEM WHICH SOMETIMES HAPPENS WHEN I'M GOING FAST SO I APOLOGIZE I US IS AS A MOMENT TO JUST SAY TEMPERATURE VARIES A LOT ACROSS THE DAY AND NIGHT THAT WAS TE THEME OF PREVIOUS PODCAST SO WE CANT RELLY TALK ABOUT AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ANYWAY BUT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT AVERAGE TEMPERATURE AS NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX I MISPOKE MY ERROR AND I APOLOGIZE THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME IN THIS JOURNEY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AN BIOLOGY AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS THAT MAKE US WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE FUNCTION IN SLEEP AND IN WAKEFULNESS IT'S REALLY AN INCREDIBLE LANDSCAPE TO CONSIDER AND I HOPE THAT YOUARE GETTING A LOT OUT OF THE INFORMATION AS ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR

WELCOME TO THE UBERMEN LAONSCIENCE SCIENCE PACETOE I MENDR HUBERMEN AND O'M A PROFESSOR OF NAUROBIOLOGY AND UPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE'RE TALKING ALL ABOUT HABITS IN PARTICULAR WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THE BIOLOGY OF HABIT FORMATION ND THE BIOLOGY OF HOW WE BREAK HABITS THINK WE CAN ALL APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF HABING HABITS HABITS ORGANIZE OUR BEHAVIOR INTO MORE OR LESS REFLECSIVE ACTIONS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT PERFORMING THE VARIOUS BEHAVIORS THAT FOR INSTANCE ALLOW US TO BRUSH OUR TEA THOR WHICH SIDE OF BED WE ROLL OUT OF IN THE MORNING AND THEN OF COURSE HABITS CAN BE MORE ELABORATE TOO WE CAN BE IN THE HABIT OF EXERCISING AT A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY WE CAN BEAN THE HABIT OF EATING CERTAIN FOODS WE CAN BE IN THE HABIT OF SAYING OR NOT SAYING CERTAIN THINGS BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY HABITS THAT DON'T SERVE US WELL OR THAT PERHAPS EVEN UNDERMINE OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH GOALS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL GOALS AND EVEN SOME HABITS THAT CAN REALLY UNDERMINE ARE OVERALL LIFE GOALS SO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAKING MEANING FORMING AND BREAKING MEANING STOPPING VARIOUS HABITS THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT HABITS YOU'LL FIND THIS IN THE POPULAR SPHERE THEREARE BOOKS THER ARTICLES THERE WORKSHOPS AND SO FORTH HOWEVER LESS ARE KNOWN IS THAT THEREIS A WHOLE NAURO SCIENCE OF HABIT FORMATION AND HABIT BREAKING AND THERE'S A WHOLE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY DEVOTED TO UNDERSTANDING HABIT FORMATION AND HABIT BREAKING AND WITHIN THOSE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURES I THINK THERE 'RE SOME REAL GEMS THAT AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE WE HAVEN'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO IN THE POPULAR SPHERE SO TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF HABIT FORMATION AND HABIT BREAKING I'M ALSO GOING TO SPELL OUT TWO SPECIFIC TYPES OF HABIT FORMATION AND HABIT BREAKING PROGRAMS AND MEN OV BOIL THESE DOWN TO SOME VERY EXPLICIT STEPS THAT ANY ONE CAN USE MY REASONING FOR DOING THAT IS FIRST OF ALL ITS THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE MANY PEOPLE ARE THINKIN ABOUT NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS THEY'R THINKING ABOUT LEAVING SOME THINGS BEHINE FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND PREVIOUS AND ACQUIRING SOME NEW BEHAVIORS TAKING ON SOME NEW CHALLENGES AND TRYING TO BRING NEW THINGS TO THEIR LIVES BUT REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS THE PROGRAMS THAT I'LL OUTLINE ARE GROUNDED IN THE NAURO SCIENCE AND BIOLOGY OF HABIT FORMATION AND THEY MAP VERY WELL TO WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF HABIT FORMATION AND BREAKING SO TO DAY GOUR IN A LEARN A LOT OF SCIENCE YOU'RE ALSO GOINGTO COME AWAY WITH SOME PRACTICAL TOOLS AND I'M CERTAIN THAT REGARDLESS OF YOUR PRESENT STATE OR GOALS THE'LL BE SOMETHING OF VALUE TO YOU BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASISE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZEROCOSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME ID LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSERS HAVE TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SAWM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS THE REASON I STILL TAKE OUT LETEGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MAGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH ORE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIV YOU FIE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATE AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WOERE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN INVITEMEND THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELLF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'R GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPL PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WAN A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DO CAM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT HABITS AND ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING BOUT HABITS THAT MEANS OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM LEARN SOMETHING NOW MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT HABITS ARE JUST LIKE REFLECXES BUT PURE REFLECES OUR THINGS LIKE THE IBLINK REFLEC YOU OV SOMETHING COMES TOWARD YOUR EYE AND YOU DON'T WANT I TO GET IN YOUR EYE YOU'LL BLINK OR IF YOU HAPPEN TO STEP ON A SHARP OBJECT OR GET TO CLOSE TO SOMETHING THATS TO HOT YOU'LL REFLECIVELY MOVE AWAY THOSE AREN'T HABITS THOSE ARE WHAT WE CALL HARD WIRED REFLEXES HABITS ARE THINGS THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM LEARNED BUT NOT ALWAYS CONSCIOUSLY SOMETIMES WE DEVELOF HABITS THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF TILL THEY BECOME A PROBLEM OR MAYBE THEY SERVE US WELL WHO KNOWS BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT HABITS ARE A BIG PART OF WHO WE ARE WHAT WE DO HABITUALLY MAKES UP MUCH OF WHAT WE DO ENTIRELY IN FACT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT UP TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF OUR WAKING BEHAVIOR IS MADE UP OF HABITUAL BEHAVIOR YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BIOLOGY MEANING CELLS AND HORMONS AND NEURAL PATHWAYS ET CETERA THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE HABITS SO F HABITS ARE LARGELY LEARNED CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS LEARNING WELL LEARNING IS NURO PLASTICITY NERO PLASTICITY IS SIMPLY THE PROCESS BY WHICH ARE NERVOUS SISTEM CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCES WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT CHANGES WELL WHAT CHANGES ARE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURONS NURONS ARE JUST NERVE CELLS THETY COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER BY ELECTRICITY AND BY SENDING CHEMICAL SIGNALS TO ONE ANOTHER THAT INSPIRE THE NEXT NURON AND THE NEXT NURON TO EITHER BE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE OR NOT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY NEURL PLASTICITY IS ABOUT FORMING NEW NERAL CIRCUITS NEW PATHWAYS BY WHICH CERTAIN HABITS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR AND OTHER ONES ARE LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR SO WE'VE GOT HABITS WE HAVE THAT HABITS ARE LEARNED WE HAVE THAT LEARNING INVOLVES NERAL PLASTICITY AND THAT NERL PLASTICITY INVOLVES CHANGES IN THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURONS NERVE CELLS O CASE OF THAT DESCRIBES HABITS THROUGH THE LENDS OF NEURO SCIENCE AND BIOLOGY BUT AS MANY OF YOU ARE WELL AWARE THERE ARE POPULAR BOOKS ABOUT HABITS AND THERE'S A WHOLE PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE ABOUT HABITS AND THOSE TWO ARIAS POINT TO SOME VERY INTERESTING ASPECTS OF HABITS THAT I THINK ARE WORTH MENTIONING FIRST OF ALL IS THIS NOTION OF IMMEDIATE GOAL BASED HABITS VERSES IDENTITY BASED HABITS IMMEDIATE GOAL BASED HABITS ARE GOING TO BE HABITS THAT ARE DESIGN TO BRING YOU A SPECIFIC OUTCOME AS YOU DO THEM SO EACH IN EVERY TIME YOU DO THEM SO FOR INSTANCE IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU WANT TO DEVELOP A HABIT OF GETTING AND I YOU KNOW SIXTY MINUTES OF ZON TO CARDIO EACH DAY O ER PERHAPS OU NOW THREE FOUR TIMES A WEEK AS WE HAD INTO THE NEW YEAR I'VE TALKED BEFORE ON THE POD CAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND THE HEALTH LITRATURE REALLY POINTS TO THE INCREDIBLY POSITIVE EFFECTS OF GETTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTS TO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MINUTES PER WEEK MINIMUM OF WHAT'S CLLED ZONE TO CARDIO ZOWN TO CARDIO S BASICALLY ANY CARDY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE THAT GETS YOU MOVING AND YOUR HEART PUMPING AND BREATHING BUT NOT SO HARD THAT YOU CAN'T HOLD HA CONVERSATION A CONTOPUTS YOU AT THE THRESHOLD OF BEING JUST ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT'S A LITTLE BIT STRAIN BUT IF YOU WERE TO EXERCISE A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND RUN A LITTLE BIT FAST OR ET CETERA YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TALK WHILE YOU DID IT THERE'S A LOT OF LITERATURE THAT POINTS TO THAT AS A HEALTHY PRACTICE SO MAYBE YOUR SOMEBODY THAT WANTS TO GET MORE OF ZONE TO CARDIO FOR INSTANCE THAT WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE GOAL BASED HABIT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GET THAT CARDIO MAY BE OF FOUR TIMES A WEEK EVERY TIME YOU DO IT YOU COULD CHECK OFF A OLD BOX AND YOU SAYK I DID IT YOU MEET YOU MET THE GOAL THAT IS DIFFERENT IN SO CALLED IDENTITY BASED HABITS WHERE R THERE'S A LARGER OVER ARCHING HEM TO THE HABIT WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO BECOME CODEN QUOTE A FIT PERSON OR YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO BE A AN ATHLETE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT IT'S WHERE YOU START TO ATTACH SOME SORT OF LARGER PICTURE ABOUT YOURSELF OR WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU TO DO THAT HABIT WHERE THERE'S BOTH THE IMMEDIATE GOAL I COMPLETE THE EXERCISE COMPLETE THE THE SESTION OR WHATEVER IT IS AM CHECK OFF THAT BOX BUT THAT YOU'RE LINKING IT TO SOME SORT OF LARGER GOAL NOW WHY AM I MAKING THIS DISTINCTION I MEAN AT FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT THE ONE TO FIRST MAKE THIS DISTINCTION OTHERS HAVE MADE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN IDENTITY FERSES IMMEDIATE GOALBASED HABIT FORMATION BUT THE REASON I MAKING THE DISTINCTION IS THAT PRETTY SOON IN OUR DISCUSSION TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE A MOLECULE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH MOTIVATION AND REWARD THAT WE MAKE IN OUR BRAIN AND HOW DIFFERENT SCHEDULS OF DOPAMINE RELEASE PREDICT WHETHER NOT WE WILL STICK TO A HABIT OR NOT AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER NOT WE WILL BE ABLE TO FORM THAT HABIT QUICKLY OR NOT W THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON BANOTHER THING THAT OU'LL HEARE OUT THERE IN THE LITERATURE IS THAT IT TAKES TWENTY ONE DAYS TO FORM A HABIT SOME PEOPLE SAY EIGHTEEN SOME PEOPLE SAY TWENTY ONE SOME PEOPLE SAY THIRTY DAYS SOME PEOPLE SAY SIXTY DAYS SO WHICH ONE IS IT DOES IT DEPEND ON THE HABIT THAT ONE IS TRYIN TO FORM OR DOES IT DEPEND ON THE PERSON THATS TRY AND AT FORM THE HABIT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S EXCELLENT PEER REVIEW DATA ON THIS THERE'S A STUDY PUBLISH IN TWENTY TEN FORSTAUTHOR LALLEY ALE AL EL OY THIS STUDY FOUND THAT FOR THE SAME HABIT TO BE FORMED IT CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTEEN DAYS TO AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR DAYS FOR DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS TO FORM THAT HABIT THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS THAT I ALWAYS GET ASKED IS IT TRUE THAT IT TAKES TWENTY ONE DAYS TO FORM A HABIT IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR NERVOU SISTEM CHANGES IN SIX DAYS WHEN YOU'REDOING SOMETHING REPEATEDLY AND THE ANSWER IS AS I MENTION BEFORE ITS HIGHLY VARIABLE WHAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU ACTUALLY WAS WHAT SPECIFIC HABIT THEY WERE LOOKING AT IN THAT LALLEY STUDY AND IT'S INTERESTING THIS THE SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR WAS A HEALTH RELATED BEHAVIOR PRETTY RELEVANT TAUR DISCUSSION HERE ON THE PODCAST WHICH WHO HAS TAKING WALKS AFTER DINNER SI SHE A REALLY NICE LITERATURE SHOWING THAT WALKS AFTER A MEAL CAND SPEED GLUECOST CLEARANCE FROM THE LOOD STREAM CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR NOT JUST WEIGHT LOSS BUT CARTVASCULAR HEALTH ET CETERA SO A WALK AFTER DINNER SEEMS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD RIGHT WELL IN ORDER TO FORM THAT HABIT IT TOOK SOME PEOPLE EIGHTEEN DAYS AND OTHER PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR DAYS HOW DID THEY KNOW WHEN THEY FORM THE HABIT WELL THEY WERE DOING IT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TIME AND THEY ALSO REPORTED NOT HAVING TO SPEND THAT MUCH MENTAL EFFORT IN ORDER TO GET INTO THE MODE OF TAKING A WALK AFTER DINNER SO FOR THOSE OF YOU LISTENING SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT TAKE  SOME PEOPLE TWO UNDER FIFTY FOUR DAYS TO GET INTO THAT HABIT BUT AS I SAID PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE AND IF YOU CAN'T FORM ONE HABIT EASILY IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T FORM OTHER HABITS EASILY THE MYSTERY OF WYSE CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN FORM CERTAIN HABITS MORE EASILY THAN OTHERS PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOW WELL PEOPLE MANAGE WHAT'S CALLED LIMBIC FRICTION NOW LIMBIC FRICTION IS NOT A TERM THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IN THE FORMAL NERBIOLOGICAL LITERATURE OR EVEN PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE IT'S FRANKLY A TERM THAT I COINED TO ENCOMPASS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE PSYCHOLOGY IN NOURA SCIENCE LITERATURE LIMBIC FRICTION IS A SHORT HAND WAY THAT I USE TO DESCRIBE THE STRAIN THAT'S REQUIRED IN ORDER TO OVERCOME ONE OF TOO STATES WITHIN YOUR BODY ONE STATE IS ONE OF ANXIOUSNESS WHERE YOU REALLY ANXIOUS AND THEREFORE YOU CAN'T CALM DOWN YOU CAN'T RELAX AND THEREFORE YOU CAN'T ENGAGE IN SOME PARTICULAR ACTIVITY OR THOUGHT PATTERN THAT YOU WOULD LIKE THE OTHER STATE IS ONE IN WHICHYOU'RE FEELING TOO TIRED OR LAZY OR NOT MOTIVATED BOTH OF THOSE STATES FEELING TOO ALERT AND TOO CALM IF YOU WILL RELATE TO THE FUNCTION OF THE SO CALLED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM A SET OF NURONS AND HORMONS AND CHEMICALES IN YOUR BRAIN IN BODY THAT ACT IS SORT OF A SEASAW YOU'RE EITHER ALERT OR CALM YOUEITHER A SLEEP OR STRESSED THOSE TWO STATES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ONE ANOTHER YOU PROUTLY HEARD OF WIRED AND TIRED BUT THAT'S REALLY ONCE YOU'VE BEEN VERY STRESS FOR A LONG TIME TO THE POINT WHERE YOUR EXHAUSTED WHAT IS THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HAVE TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS WELL LIMBIC FRICTION IS A PHRASE THAT CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE HOW MUCH AFFORT HOW MUCH ACTIVATION ENERGY YOU NEED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR SO USING THIS LALLEY STUDY IS AN EXAMPLE SOME PEOPLE WOULD EAT DINNER AND THEN SAY OH THAT'S RIGHT I HAVEBEN TRYING TO DEVELOP THE HABIT OF TAKING A WALK AFTER DINNER SO LET'S GET UP AND GO OTHER PEOPLE WIL FEELIK I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT TO DAY THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL TOO MUCH LIMBIC FRICTION AND THAT LIMBIC FRICTION COULD ARRIVE AGAIN FROM ONE OF TWO SOURCES IT COULD BE BECAUSE THEY ARE TO TIRED TO DO IT OR IT COULD BE BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO ANXIOUS AND DISTRACTED IN ORDER TO DO IT SO THIS IS A KEY DISTINCTION A LOT OF HABIT FORMATION HAS TO DO WITH BEING IN THE RIGHT STATE OF MIND AND BEING ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR STATE OF BODY AND MIND SO IS WE MARCH FORWARD WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS THAT THIS PHRASE OR THIS TERM LIMBIC FRICTION IS GOING TO BE A USEFUL METRIC OR WAY FOR YOU TO TOUCH IN WITH YOURSELF AND ADDRESS WHETHER NOT YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO FORM A CERTAIN HABIT EASILY OR WHETHER NOT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CHALLENGING AND I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU AWAY TO MEASURE YOUR DEGREE OF LIMBIC FRICTION THAT IS HOW MUCH ACTIVATION ENERGY IT WILL TAKE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO EXECUTE A NEW HABIT AND I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO MEASURE YOUR LIMBIC FRICTION AN ACTIVATION ENERGY FOR HOW LIKELY IT IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BREAK A HABIT THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE OTHER KEY CONCEPT FOR US TO ADDRESS THAT'S REALLY MAINLY FOUND IN THE BOOKS AND ARTICLES OUT THEREABOUT HABITS IS THIS NOTION OF WHAT I CALL LINCH PIN HABITS LINCHPIN HABITS ARE CERTAIN HABITS THAT MAKE A LOT OF OTHER HABITS EASIER TO EXECUTE WTHE SORTS OF LINCHPIN HABITS THAT A'M REFERRING TO ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE THINGS THAT YOU ENJOYED DOING A JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM MY LIFE I HAPPEN TO LIKE EXERCISE NOT ALL FORMS OF EXERCISE BUT I HAPPEN TO LIKE RESISTANCE TRAINING AND A HAPPEND LIKE RUNNING SO I'M PERSONALLY IN THE HABIT OF GETTING CARTO YO VASCULAR EXERCISE THREE OR FOUR TIMES PER WEEK MAY BE THIRD EATO SIXTY MINUTES PERSESSION AND I'M IN THE HABIT OF DOING RESISTANCE TRAINING THREE OR FOUR TIMES PER WEEK DEPICALLY ALSO FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY MINUTES PERSESSION NOW I ENJOY THOSE AND FOR REASONS THAT I'LL GET INTO A LOBIT LAT ER I PLACE THOSE ACTIVITIES TYPICALLY EARLY IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE NARROW CHEMISTRY AN THE VARIOUS TYPES OF FOREMONES AT CETERA THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMING THOSE ACTIVITIES BUT I REALLY PLACE THOSE ACTIVITIES UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF WHAT I CALL LYNCH PIN HABITS WHY BECAUSE THOSE PARTICULAR HABITS ARE EASY TO EXECUTE BECAUSE I ENJOY THEM BUT THEY ALSO MAKE A LOT OF OTHER HABITS EASIER TO EXECUTE THINGS LIKE BEING ALERT FOR WORK THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT I GET GOOD SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE THINGS LIKE HYDRATION THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT I EAT THE FOODS THAT ARE BETTER FOR ME THAN MAY BE SOME OF THE OTHER FOODS THAT I WOULD MORE REFLECTIVELY REACH TO IF I WEREN'T DOING THAT TRAINING SO CERTAIN HABITS ACT AS LYNCH PINS MEANING THAT THEY SHIFT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAY CAN CONTROL AND BIASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IN THIS CASE YOU OR ME WE'LL PERFORM OTHER HABITS THAT ARE HARDER TO ACCESS THAT WE HAVE LESS OF AN AFFINITYFORE SO AGAIND THERE'S THREE CONCEPTS THAT WE NEED TO INCLUDE HERE WE GOT IDENTITY BASE VERSES GOALBASE HABITS WE'VE GOT THE CONCEPT THAT DIFFERENT HABITS TAKE DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME TO ADOPT DEPENDING ON THE PERSON AND THE HABIT AND THAT THERE ARE THESE WHAT I CALL LYNCH PIN HABITS SCERTAIN HABITS THAT MAKE OTHER HABITS EASIER TO EXECUTE AND THOSE LYNCH PIN HABITS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ARE THINGS THAT WE ENJOY DOING SO OUR GOL THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE IS FOR YOU TO IDENTIFY WHICH HABITS ARE EASY FOR YOU TO PERFORM WHICH ONES ARE HARD FOR YU TO PERFORM AND WHICH HABITS YOU WANT TO BREAK IF YOU WANT A GRAB AF PEN AND PAPER YOU CAN DO THAT OR IF YOU WANT TO DICTATE SOME OF THAT INTO YOUR PHONE YOU CAN BUT RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY IF YOU JUST WANT TO THINK ABOUT THESE CONCEPTS CAN ALWAYS GO BACK LATER I'LL MAKE SURE TO SPELL OUT OF VERY SPECIFIC WAY THAT YOU CAN CHART OUT A MAP TOWARDS FORMING  PARTICULAR HABITS AND BREAKING PARTICULAR HABITS LATER ON WHAT I'D LIKE US TO DO AT THIS POINT IS TO TAKE THAT CONCEPT OF LIMBIC FRICTION AND FOR YOU TO HASK YOURSELF WHANT HABITS YOU PERFORM ON A DAILY BASIS AND THESE CO BE THINGS AS BASIC AS BRUSHING YOUR TEETH BEFORE BREAKFAST ARE BRUSHING AN TEETH AFTER BREAKFAST IT COULD BE AH FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU GET EXERCISE OR YOU GET IT IN A PARTICULAR TIME A DAY OR EVEN THAT YOU TAKE A PARTICULAR ROUTE TO WORK RIGHT WHERE WE ARE VERY HABITUAL AND WE TEND TO DO THINGS MORE OR LESS OVER AND OVER IN THE SAME WAY UNLESS WE INTERVENE IN OURSELVES US JUST THE WAY THAT WE ARE WIRED SO NOW I'D LIKE TO SHIFT TO THINKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF HABITS AND THAT HABITS STRENGTH YOU ALL HAVE DIFFERENT HABITS YOU PROBABLY BRUSH YOUR TEETH AT OF PARTICULAR TIME A DAY YOU PROBABLY EXERCISE AT PARTICULAR TIMES A WEEK YOU PELBLY GO TO THE REFRIGERATOR IN A VERY HABITUAL WAY WE ARE INCREDIBLY HABITUAL ORGANISMS UNLESS WE INTERVENE IN OUR HABITS THEY TEND TOC CARRY OUT THE SAME WAY THAT THEY ALWAYS HAVE ONCE THEY FORMED SO YOU CAN DO THIS EXERCISE NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUT YOU CERTAINLY ARE WELCOME WE'RE GOING TO AVALUATE WHAT'S CALLED HABIT STRENGTH THAT'S NOT A CONCEPT THAT I CREATED HABIT STRENGTH TO SOMETHING THAT YOUWILL FIND IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE HABIT'S STRENGTH IS MEASURED BY TWO MAIN CRITERIA THE FIRST IS HOW CONTEXT DEPENDENT A GIVEN HABIT IS SO CONTET DEPENDENTS IS IF YOU GO FROM ONE ENVIRONMENT TO THE NEXT DO YOU TEND TO DO THE SAME THING IN THE SAME WAY AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY SO FOR INSTANCE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH FIRST THING THE MORNING MAY BE SOME OF YOU DO THAT BEFORE BREAKFAST MAY BE SOME OF YOU DO THAT LATER MAY BE SOME OF YOU LIKE ME DON'T EVEN EAT BREAKFAST BUT WHEN I TRAVEL I TEND TO BRUSH MY TEETH AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME TIME OF DAY RELATIVE TO WHEN I WAKE UP AS I DO WHEN I'M AT HOME SO IT'S CONTEXT INDEPENDENT SO IT A VERY STRONG HABIT IGHT THERE CERTAIN BEHAVIOURS WY PERHAPS WHAT YOU EAT OR UM YOU KNOW PERHAPS HOW YOU DRESS THAT ARE CONTEXT INDEPENDENT THAT YOU MIGHT PERFORM ONE WAY IN ONE CONTEXT IN ANOTHER WAY IN ANOTHER CONTEXT THE OTHER ASPECT OF HABITS STRENGTH IS HOW MUCH LIMBIC FRICTION IS REQUIRE TO PERFORM THAT HABIT ON A REGULAR BASIS THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING HABITS AND CONSOLIDATING THOSE HABITS THEN IT PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE MORE LIMBIC FRICTION TO EXECUTE THOSE HABITS WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL LET' SAY YOU SET OUT TO GET LET'S A FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF ZONTO CARDIOICS SISE EVERY DAY FIVER AY EVEN SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WELL IF AT FIRST YOU'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED LIMBI FRICTION MIGHT BE PRETTY LOW LIMBIC FRICTION IS HOW MUCH TOP DOWN MEANING FROM YOUR FOREBRAIN TO YOUR LIMBIC SYSTEM THE PART OF YOUR BRAIN THAT GENERATES AUTONOMIC RESPONSES HOW MUCH LIMBIC FRICTION MEANING CONSCIOUS OVERRIDE OF YOUR STATE IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN THAT PARTICULAR BEHAVIOUR SO IF YOUR FEELING PARTICULARLY TIRED AND YOU DO WANT TO GET UP OUT OF BED AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT AND DO YOUR S OWN TO CARDIO THAT THAN THERE'S A HIGH DEGREE OF LIMBIC FRICTION IT TAKES SOME PEOPLE THINK OF IS MOTIVATION BUT MOTIVATION IS A BIT OF A VAGUE CONCEPT TO WHEREAS LIMBIC FRICTION INVOLVE SPECIFIC NERAL CIRCUITS AND YOU CAN THINK OF IT IN MORE OR LESS QUANTITATIVE WAY YOU CAN THINK OF THAT YOUR BODY IS VERY TIRED SO ITS CAN TAKE MORE LIMBIC FRICTION IN ORDER TO GET INTO ACTION RIGHT YOU U HAVE TO OVERCOME MORE LIMBIC FRICTION SCUSE ME WHEREAS IF YOUARE VERY VERY ALERT IT'S THERE'S LESS LIMBIC FRICTION BECAUSE YOU'R MOVING TOWARD SOMETHING THAT'S ACTION OR ENTED HOWEVER THE INVERSE IS ALSO TRUE LET'S SAY THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THE HABIT OR YOU'RE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF FORMING A HABIT TO MEDITATE REGULARLY THAT'S A PRETTY QUIESCENT OR CALMING ACTIVITY SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY W COMES HOME FROM WORK AND YOU'R A VERY ANXIOUS AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH A BUNCH OF THINGS THERE'S A LOT OF LIMBIC FRICTION TO OVERCOME IN ORDER TO GET INTO THAT CALM STATE SO THESE TWO ASPECTS CONTEXT DEPENDENTS WHETHER NOT YOUR LIKELY TO DO THE THING REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE I ON TRAVEL AT HOME ON VACATION WITH PEOPLE AROUND NOT PEOPLE AROUND ET CETERA AND HOW MUCH LIMBIC FRICTION IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THAT HABIT WILL TELL YOU WHETHER NOT THAT HABIT IS DEEPLY OR JUST SHALLOWLY MBEDDED WITHIN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THE GOAL OF ANY HABIT THAT WE WANT TO FORM IS TO GET INTO WHAT'S CALLED AUTOMATICITY AUTOMATICITY IS FANCY LANGUAGE FOR THE NORRAL CIRCUITS CAN PERFORM IN AUTOMATICALLY AND THAT'S THE ULTIMATE PLACE TO BE AND IF YOU HAVE ALL THESE GOALS AND THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING ON A REGULAR BASIS YOU LOVE FOR THEM TO BE HABITUAL BECAUSE IT TAKES LESS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EFFORT LESS LIMBIC FRICTION IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THOSE AND SO MUCH OF WHAT'S OUT THERE AGAIN IN THE POPULAR PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE IN BOOKS THAT YOU'LL FIND ON THE BOOKS STORE SHELF AND ON AMAZON AND THE IRPORTS ARE ABOUT HOW TO GET FROM THAT MODE OF HIGH DEGREE OF LIMBIC FRICTION TO AUTOMATICITY AND THEY OFFER A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS I THINK MANY OF WHICH ARE USEFUL I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO ORGANIZE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HABITS INTO DIFFERENT BINS LIKE VALUE BASED AND GOAL BASED AND I'M TRYING TO PERSUADE YOU THAT STRUCTURING HABITS AT THE PARTICULAR TIMES OF DAY OR IN A PARTICULAR WAY ORE GOING TO BE BENT OFFICIAL AND INDEED I THINK THEY HAVE HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TO TAKE THE PSIENTIFIC LITERATURE OF HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM LEARNS AND ENGAGES IN NERO PLASTICITY AND APPLY THAT TO HABIT FORMATION HABIT MAINTENANCE AND IF SO DESIRED HOW TO BREAK PARTICULAR HABITS I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PARTICULAR TOOL THAT'S GLEANED FROM THE RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE SHOULD MENTION THAT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS FROM AN EXCELLENT REVIEW ARTICLE THAT'S AVAILABLE IN LINE IT'S CALLED PSYCHOLOGY OF HABIT THE AUTHORS ARE WENDY WOOD AND DENIS RUNGER THIS IS PUBLISHED IN ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY THE ANNUAL REVIEWS SERIES IS A VERY HIGH QUOLOTY SERIES THERE ARE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF NORROW SCIENCE ANDREVIEWS OF PSYCHOLOGY AND REVIEWS OF NUTRICION SCIENCE ET CETERA FOR THOSE OF YOU THEIR INTEREST AN EXPLORING REVIEW ARTICLES THAT ARE GROUNDED IN HUNDREDS OF QUALOTY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES THE ANNUAL REVIEW SERIES IS REALLY TERRIFIC 'V CERTAINLY AMONG THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST ND THEY ALSO THEN TO BE QUITE LONG AN QUITE COMPREHENSIVE SO THIS REVIEW PSYCHOLOGY OF HABIT BY WOOD AN WRUNGER IS EXCELLENT AND HERE I MOREOR LESS PERAPHRASING FROM THEM SARE ONE TO BE CLEAR THAT A THESE ARE THEIR WORDS NOT MINE THEIRE TALKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS WAYS THAT HABITS FORM IN THE NERVOUS SISTEM AND THEY MENTION WITH EACH REPETITION OF A HABIT SMALL CHANGES OCCUR IN THE CHOGNIVIN NERAL MACHANISMS ASSOTI ASSOCIATE WITH PRECDURAL MEMORY I JUST WANT TO TALK FOR SECOND BOUT WHAT PREEDURAL MEMORY IS IN THE NORW SCIENCE OF MEMORY WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT'S CALLED EPOSOTIC MEMORY AND PRECEDURAL MEMORY EPOSOTIC MEMORY IS A RECALL OF A PARTICULAR SET OF EVENTS THAT HAPPENED WHEREAS PRECEDURAL MEMORY IS HOLDING IN MIND THE SPECIFIC SEQUENCE OF THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN ORDER FOR A PARTICULAR OUTCOME TO OCCUR SO THINK OF IT LIKE A RECIPY OR A PROTOCAL OR IF FORSAKE OF EXERCISE ITS LIKE SETS AN RAPS OR A PARTICULAR COURSE THAT YOUARE GOING TO RUN OR PSYCHL OR THE NUMBER OF LAPS YAU'RE GOING TO SWIM AND HOW YOU'RE GING TO PERFORM IT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT FOR ANY ONE TRYING TO ADOPT NEW HABITS GETTING INTO THE MIND SET OF PROCEDRAL MEMORY IS VERY USEFUL FOR OVERCOMING THAT BARRIER THAT WE CALL LIMBIC FRICTION HOW DO YOU DO THAT WELL A SIMPLE VISUALIZATION EXERCISE ARE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE DONE EYES CLOSED YOU OFTENTIMES WE HEARE VISUALIZATION EXERCISE YOU THINK ABOUT SITTING IN THE LOW DISPOSITION EYES CLOSES AN YOU TRYING REALLY HARD TO VISUALIZE SOMETHING DOESN'T NEED TO BE ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT CAN SIMPLY BE IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO ADOPT A NEW HABIT TO JUST THINK ABOUT THE VERY SPECIFIC SEQUENCE OF STEPS THAT'S REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THAT HABIT AND I'LL USE A TRIVIAL EXAMPLE BUT THIS COULD BE APPLIED TO ANYTHING WHAT SAY I WANT TO GET INTO THE HABIT OF MAKING MYSELF FOR SOME ONE ELSE IN MY HOUSEHOLD A CUP OF RESPRESSO EVERY MORNING I WOULD ACTUALLY THINK THROUGH EACH OF THOSE STEPS WALK INTO THE KITCHEN TURN ON THE EXPRESSIR MACHINE DRAW THE EXPRESSIV WALKING THROUGH EACH OF THOSE STEPS FROM START TO FINISH AND TURNS OUT JUST THAT SIMPLE MENTAL ECERCISE DONE ONCE CAN SHIFT PEOPLE TOWARD A MUCH HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF PERFORMING THAT HABIT REGULARLY NOT JUST THE FIRST TIME BUT AS THEY CONTINUE OUT INTO THE DAYS AND WEEKS THAT FOLLOW THAT'S REMARKABLE TO ME AND THE LITERATURE IS REALLY ROBUST JUST ONE MENTAL EXERCISE OF THINKING THROUGH WHATARE THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PERFORM THIS HABIT FROM START TO FINISH CAN SHIFT THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING ABLE TO PERFORM THAT HABIT FROM UNLIKELY OR TO MODERATELY LIKELY TO VARY LIKELY OVER TIME AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT PULLS FROM THIS PROCESS HAT INVOLVES OUR HYPPOCAMPUS IN OURNEAL QUARTEXS AND OTHER AREAS OF OUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ENGAGE IN PROCEDRAL MEMORY IT SHIFTS THE BRAIN TOWARDS A A MIND SET IF YOU WILL A IT'S MORE OF A NERAL CIRCUIT SET IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE BUT A MIND SET SLASH NERAL CIRCUIT SET OF DOING THINGS IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE WHICH ALLOWS THAT LIMBIC FRICTION TO COME DOWN AND INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM THAT THING SIMPLE TOOL BUT VERY POWERFUL TOOL ACCORDING TO THE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE AND ACTUALLY THE CELLER AND MOLICULAR MECHANISMS THAT UNDER LIE THAT SORT OF PROCEDURAL MEMORY STEPPING THROUGH PHENOMENON ARE KNOWN IN THIS ARTICLE I MENTION THIS BEAUTIFUL REVIEW A THEY TALK ABOUT SO CALLED HEBYAN LEARNING DONALD HEBWAS E PSYCHOLOGIST A IN CANADA AND BIRST THIS FEEL THAT IS NOW LASTED CUSH O MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AND IS STILL VERY STRONG IN NERO SCIENS AN PSYCHOLOGY OF HEABY AND LEARNING HEABY AND LEARNING IS WHEN PARTICULAR NURONS ARE COACTIVE MEANING WHEN THEY FIRE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CONNECTIONS WITH FORM ANOTHER AND AS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT UNDER LYING CELLER AN MOLECULAR FEATURES THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO IN DETAIL BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT TO KNOW I KNOW SOME OF YOUR HUNGRY FOR LOBIT MORE NERG SCIENCE A THIS INVOLVES THINGS LIKE ENM DA RECEPTORS AND METHEL DE ASPIRTATE RECEPTORS T ENEMDY A RECEPTORS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK FOR EVERY ONE TO UNDERSTAND SO JUST TELL YOU LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM THESE ARE RECEPTORS THAT ARE ON THE NRON SURFACE AND NORMALLY THEY DON'T CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO THE ACTIVITY OF THOSE NURANS THOSE NURNS ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DOING THEIR THING WITHOUT ACTIVATION OF THIS ENEMDY A RECEPTOR BUT WHEN A NURON GETS A VERY STRONG IM PUT A STRONG STIMULUS THAT ENEMDY A RECEPTOR TRIGGERS A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS THAT RECRUIT TO THE SURFACE OF THE NURON MORE OTHER RECEPTORS AND OTHER WORDS IT MAKES THAT NUR ON MORE RESPONSIVE TO IMPUT IN THE FUTURE SUCH THAT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE SO MUCH IMPUT IN OTHER WORDS IT TAKES A NURON THAT IS VERY UNLIKELY TO FIRE AND MAKES IT MORE LIKELY TO FIRE SO THIS PRECEDURAL STEPING THROUGH OF THE STEPS OF THE RECIPE OR THE SERIES OF ACTION STPS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN SITTING DOWN TO STUDY AND WRITING FOR AN HOUR OR GENERATING EXERCISE WHATEVER IT IS THE HABIT YOU'RE TRING TO LEARN WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT EXERCISE IT'S NOT AS IF YOURE NERVOUS SYSTEM THINKS YOU'RE ACTUALLY PERFORM IN THE BEHAVIOUR OU NERVOUS SYSTEM ISN'T STUPID IT'S ASUALLY A LOT SMARTER THAN THAT IT KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A THOUGHT AND AN THACTION BUT WHEN YOU DO THAT IT SETS IN MOTION THE SAME NURONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED FOR THE EXECUTION OF THAT HABIT AND SO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SHOW UP TO PERFORM THAT HABIT IT'S AS IF THE DOMINOS FALL MORE EASILY IT'S IT'S A ON LOWER THRESHOLD AS WE SAY IN ORDER TO GET THE HABIT TO PERFORM SO HEAVY AND LEARNING ANDEMD A RECEPTORS ALL THAT A NUTS AND BOLT STUFF ARE REALLY THE GUTS OF THE MECHANISMS OF HOW THIS WORKS BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT JUST WANT TO BE MORE HABITUAL ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS BE ABLE TO PERFORM CERTAIN THINGS MORE REFLECTIVELY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE IN YOUR LIFE SIMPLY TAKE THE TIME DO IT ONCE MAY BE TWICE AND JUST SIT DOWN CLOSE YOUR EYES IF YOU LIKE AND JUST STEP THROUGH THE PROCEDURE OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IN ORDER TO PERFORM THAT HABIT THE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE AS I MENTION AND ALSO THE NEURAW SCIENCE LITERATURE STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE FACT THAT IT IS GOING TO MAKE IT FAR EASIER FOR YOU TO ADOPT AND MAINTAIN THAT HABIT AND IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO USE TO PERFORM A HABIT AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DROPPED IT AND YOUR FRUSTRATED WITH YOURSELF THAND OU TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN GET BACK INTO THAT HABIT WELL BY ALL MEANS LEAN RIGHT BACK INTO THAT HABIT BUT IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE DOING THAT ALSO JUST USE THE PRECEDURAL MEMORY EXERCISE IN ORDER TO SHIFT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TOWARDS A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WILL RETURN TO THAT HABIT JUST THE SAME WAY I DESCRIBED FOR TRYING TO INITIATE A NEW HABIT SO NOW I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS A SECOND AND WHAT I THINK IT'S PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL FOR BEING ABLE TO ACQUIRED AND STICK TO NEW HABITS THIS TOOL IS ROOTED IN WHAT WE CALL NEURAL CIRCUITS AND I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THOSE NEURAL CIRCUITS WORK FOR THOSE OF YOU THEIR SAYING JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO I HAVE TO SAY AS I ALWAYS SAY UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT OR A LOT OF UNDERLYING MECHANISM WILL HELP SOLIDIFY THESE CONCEPTS FOR YOU AND WELL HELP IN SURE THAT THE TOOLS THAT I OFFER ARE GOING TO MAKE SENSE AND THAT THEY 'RE GOING TO MAKE SENSE IN DIFFERENT CONTECTS AND FOR DIFFERENT TYPE OF HABITS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN SO RATHER THAN JUST TELL YOU WHAT TO DO OM AN I TELL YOU HOW THIS PARTICULAR TOAL WORKS AND THAN IN DOING THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY TO ANY HABIT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS THE TOOL THAT I'M REFERRING TO IS SOMETHING CALLED TASK BRACKETING AND THE NERAL CIRCUITS ASSOCIATE WITH TASK BRACKETING AR BASICALLY THE NAURAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO LEARN ANY NEW TYPE OF HABIT OR BREAK ANY HABIT THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BREAK WE HAVE IN OUR BRAIN A SET OF NERAL CIRCUITS THAT FALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA TERM OF THE BASIL GANGLIA THE BAZIL GANGLIA ARE INVOLVED IN ACTION EXECUTION MEANING DOING CERTAIN THINGS AND ACTION SUPPRESSION NOT DOING CERTAIN THINGS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL REALM THESE ARE REFERRED TO AS GO MEANING DO OR NOGO DON'T DO CERTAIN THINGS AND SOME OF US FALL MORE INTO THE CATEGORY OF WE FIND IT VERY EASY TO DO CERTAIN THINGS BUT HARDER TO NOT DO OTHER THINGS SOME PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF NOGO TYPE CIRCUITS THAT ARE VERY ROBUST AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF BEHAVIORAL CONSTRAINT BUT THEY HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING INTO ACTION AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE A PERFECT BALANCE OF BOTH BUT I'VE NEVER MET ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE SO AGAIN DRAWING FROM AND MOR LESS PERAPHRASING FROM THIS BEAUTIFUL REVIEW THI DESCRIBED EARLIER IN IN REVIEW ANUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY EXCUSE ME BY WOOD AND WRUNGER TASK BRACKENING INVOLVES A PARTICULAR SET OF NERAL CIRCUITS WITHIN THE BASIL GANGLIA SO I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE THIS HERE AGAIN PERAPHRASING A CENSRY MOTOR LUCENSORY MEANS JUST IMPUT COMING IN ABOUT SIT SOUNDS TASTES ET CETERA AND THEN THE MOTOR SYSTEMS THE SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT GENERING ACTION TAKING THAT INFORMATION IN GENERATING ACTION SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S AN AREA OF OUR BASIL GANGLIA CALLED THE DORSYLATERAL STRIATUM WE CAN USE THE ACRNYM D L S AGAIN DORSO LATERAL STRIATUM DORSO MEANS UP LATRAL MEANS TO THE SIDES AF DORCILATERAL AND STRIATUM IS A SUBDIVISION OF THE BASAL GANGLIA AND ITS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BEHAVIORS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE HABIT BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE HABIT ITSELF AND BEAUTIFUL STUDIES IN BOTH ANIMALS AND HUMANS THAT RECORD THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THE DORCYLATERAL STRIATUM FIND THAT THE DORSYLATERAL STRATUM IS ASSOCIATED MEANING IT BECOMES ACTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF A PARTICULAR HABIT AND AT THE VERY END AND AFTER OF PARTICULAR HABIT HENCE THE PHRASE TASK BRACKETING IT BRACKETS THE HABIT NOW OTHER SETS OF NURONS ARE GOING TO BE ACTIVE DURING THE ACTUAL EXECUTION OF THE HABIT BUT WHAT THE LITERATURE ON THE DORSALATERAL STRITUM TELLS US IS THAT WE HAVE PARTICULAR CIRCUITS IN OUR BRAIN THAT ARE DEVOTED TO FRAMING THE EVENTS THAT HAPPEN JUST BEFORE AND AS WE INITIATE A HABIT AND JUST AFTER AND AS WE TERMINATE A HABIT IN OTHER WORDS IT ACTS AS A SORT OF MARKER FOR THE HABIT EXECUTION BUT NOT THE EXECUTION OF THE HABIT PERSE SAY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE TASK BRACKEING IS WHAT UNDERLIES WHEATHER NOT A HABIT WILL BE CONTEXT DEPENDENT OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL BE STRONG AND LIKELY TO RECUR EVEN IF WE DIDN'T GET A GOD NIGHT SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE EVEN IF WE'RE FEELING DISTRACTED EVEN IF WE ARE NOT FEELING LIKE DOING SOMETHING EMOTIONALLY OR IF WE ARE YOU KNOW COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED BY OTHER EVENTS IF THE NERAL CIRCUITS FOR TASK BRACKETING ARE DEEPLY IMBED IN US MEANING THEY ARE VERY ROBUST AROUND A PARTICULAR HABIT WELL THEN IT'S LIKELY THAT WE'RE GONG TO GO OUT FOR THAT ZONE TOO CARDIO NO MATTER WHAT THAT WERE IN A BRUSH OUR TEETH NO MATTER WHAT IN FACT BRUSHING OUR TEETH IS A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE FOR MOST PEOPLE EVEN IF YOU GOT A TERRIBLE NIGHTS SLEEP EVEN IF EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE IS GOING WRONG CHANCES ARE UNLESS YOUR VERY DEPRESSED IF YOU'RE GOIN TO LEAVE TO WORK OR EVEN IF YOURE NOT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO STILL CARRY OUT THE BEHAVIOR OF BRUSHING YOUR TEETH IN THE MORNING I WOULD HOPE SO ACTUALLY BUT YOU ARE PROBABLY LESS LIKELY TO PERFORM PARTICULAR HABITS THAT ARE NOT WHAT YOU DEEM AS NECESSARY BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT BRUSHING YOUR TEETH EXERCISE EATING PARTICULAR FOODS MAY BE ENGAGING SOCIALLY IN PARTICULAR WAYS YOU ARE THE ONE THAT PLACES ANY KIND OF VALUE ASSESSIMEN ON WHICH ONES ARE ESSENTIAL IN WHICH ONES ARE NEGOTIABLE SO TASK BRACKETING SETS A A NURAL IMPRINT A KIND OF A FINGER PRINT IN YOUR BRAIN OF THIS THING HAS TO HAPPEN AT THIS PARTICULAR TAME A DAY SO MUCH SO THAT ITS REFLECTS IT AND AS WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT THERE'S A WAY THAT YOU CAN BUILD UP TASK BRACKETING SO THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT THING D WHEN I SAY LEARN MEANING LET SAT YOURE CHINE TO REQUIRE A HABIT THAT FOR YOU IS REALLY CHALLENGING MAY BE AT SOME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RIGHT FOR AN HOUR A DAY ON A BOOK PROJECT THAT YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT OR YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON MATHEMATICS OR YOU'RE GOING TO DO ANY SORT OF THING THAT FOR YOU THERE'S A LOT OF LIMBIC FRICTION WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR THAT PARSSUAL MEMORY A VISUALIZATION EXERCISE WE TALK ABOUT BEFORE THAT WILL HELP THERE IS A WAY ALSO THAT YOU CAN ORIENT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TOWARD THIS TAX BRACKETING PROCESS SO THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS SHIFTED OR ORIENTED TOWARDS THE EXECUTION OF A GIVEN HABIT SO THIS IS SOR LIKE WARMING UP YOUR BODY TO EXERCISE WHEN THE DORCILATERAL STRIADAM IS ENGAGED YOUR BODY AND YOUR BRAIN ARE PRIMED TO EXECUTE A HABIT AND THAN YOU GET TO CONSCIOUSLY INSERT WHICH HABIT YOU WANT TO PERFORM SO IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE THE NERL MECHANISMS OF TASK BRACKETING IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOURE GOING TO PERFORM A PARTICULAR HABIT I HAVE TO BREAK IT TO YOU THAT ONE THING THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OVER AND OVER ABOUT HABIT FORMATION IS NOT TRUE AND WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU ARE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT EXACTLY WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO PERFORM A A PARTICULAR HABIT THAT YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO PERFORM THAT HABIT AND WHILE THAT IS TRUE IN THE SHORT TERM IT IS NOT TRUE IN THE LONG TERM AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TENDS TO GENERATE PARTICULAR KINDS OF BEHAVIORS BASED NOT ON TIME BUT ON OUR STATE MEANING WHAT LEVEL OF ACTIVATION IS TAKING PLACE IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY HOW MUCH FOCUS WE HAPPEN TO HAVE HOW FATIGUED WE ARE HOW ENERGIZED WE ARE SO WHILE SCHEDULES ARE IMPORTANT IT'S NOT THE SPECIFIC TIME OF DAY PER SAY THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO GET INTO A HABIT AND FORM THAT HABIT AND CONSOLIDATE THAT HABIT RATHER IT'S THE STATE THAT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY ARE IN THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ANCHOR YOURSELF TO SO NOW I'M GOING TO OFFER YOU A TOOL IT'S ACTUALLY AN ENTIRE PROGRAM BY WHICH YOU CAN INSERT PARTICULAR HABITS AND ACTIVITIES AT PARTICULAR PHASES OF THE DAY NOT TIMES OF DAY BUT PHASES OF THE DAY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT PARTICULAR PHASES OF THE DAY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICULAR BIOLOGICAL UNDERPENNINGS CHEMICALS AN NERL CIRCUITS AND SO FORTH AND IN DOING SO IT WILL MAKE IT FAR MORE LIKELY THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO REGULARLY ENGAGE IN THESE HABITS AND ACTIVITIES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME OWD WHETHER NOT THAT WILL MOVE YOU FROM SOMEBODY WHO ORDINARILY U WOULD TAKE TWO HUNDRED DAYS TO FORM A HABIT TOS ONE OF THOSE EIGHTEEN DAYS TO HABIT PEOPLE IN THAT EARLIER STUDY I MENTION I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT IT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT ON ALLOWING YOU TO ENGAGE IN PARTICULAR HABITS MORE EASILY AND TO CONSOLIDATE THOSE HABITS MORE QUICKLY SO THE PROGRAM I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE I FORMULATED FOR YOU BASED ON THE NORSENCE LITERATURE AND THE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE OF LEARNING AND THE CONCEPT OF TASK BRACKETING IT INVOLVES DIVIDING THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAYS INTO WHAT I CALL THREE PHASES THE FIRST IS PHASE ONE WHICH IS ZERO TO EIGHT HOURS AFTER WAKING UP APPROXIMATELY CAYL YOU CAN PUT A PLUS ARMINUS THIRTY MINUTES ON THIS FOR YOURSELF THE SECOND PHASE IS THE NINE TO FOURTEEN MAYBE FIFTEEN HOURS AFTER YOU WAKE UP AND THE THIRD PHASE IS SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER WAKING UP SO WE'VE TAKEN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PCYCLE WE'VE CARVED IT UP INTO THREE PHASES FACE ONE FACE TO AND FACE THREE EVERYTHING I'M DESCRIBING OR AT LEAST THE WAY I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE IT IS BASED ON WHAT I WILL CALL A TYPICAL SCHEDUL DIURNAL SCHEDUL YOU'VE HEARD OF NOCTURNAL WELL WE ARE DIURNAL MOST OF US ARE SLEEP AT NIGHT AND AWAIT DURING THE DAY I DO REALIZE THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE SHIFT WORK ARE THEY AVE NEW BORNS OR OTHER REASONS WHY THEY HAVE TO BE UP IN TH MILL THE NIGHT IN SLEEPING DURING THE DAY IF THAT'S THE CASE PLEASE LISTEN TO THE EPISODE THAT WE DID ON JETLAG AN SHIFT WORK BECAUSE AS A LOT OF TOOLS SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT POPULATION BUT MOST PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP SOMEWHERE ROUND TEN P M PLUS ARMINUS TWO HOURS AND WAKE UP SOME TIM AROUND SEVEN A M PLUS ARMINUS TWO HOURS SO TO DAY I'M  GOING TO USE THE TO BED AT TEN P M AND THE WAKE UP TIME OF SEVEN A M AS THE FRAME WORK FOR THIS BUT YOU COULD ADOPT IT EASILY TO YOUR PARTICULAR SCHADUL PHASE ONE WHICH AGAIN IS THE RO TO EIGHT HOURS AFTER WAKING HAS A PARTICULAR NEUROCHEMICAL SIGNATURE REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO THE NEUROMODULATORS NOR UP IN EFRAN AS WELL AS EPIN EFFERENCE SO THAT'S NORDRENDLIN AND A DRENALINE AS WELL AS THE NERMODULATOR DOPOMINE TEND TO BE ELEVATED DURING THAT FIRST ZERO TO EIGHT HOURS AFTER WAKING THERE ARE NUMBER REASONS FOR THIS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT ALSO CORTIS ALL IS HIRER IN OUR BRAIN AN BLOOD STREAM IT'S A HEALTHY LEVEL CORT IS ALL UPON WAKING BODY TEMPERATURE IS INCREASED ET CETERA AND THERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING OF TALKED ABOUT MANY OF THESE ON THE PODCAST BEFORE THAT IN ADDITION TO THOSE CHEMICALS FURTHER SUPPORT AN ALERT AND FOCUSED STATE AND IL JUST LIST THOSE OFF I'VE DONE MANY PODCASTS ON EACH OF THESE YOU'D LIKE TO ACCESS AS PODCASTS YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THE MENUOF PODCASTS ON YOU TWOBAPPLES POTIFY ET CETERA THEY INVOLVE FOR INSTANCE VIEWING SUNLIGHT OR BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IF YOU CAN'T ACCESS SUNLIGHT WITHIN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF WAKING PHYSICAL EXERCISE OF SOME KIND IN THIS FIRST PHASE OF THE DAY ZERO TO EIGHT HOURS OF THE DAY IDEALLY PRETTY EARLY IN THAT PHASE BUT YOU KNOW IF IT HAS TO BE IT THE SEVENTY EIGHT HOUR TRANSITION POINT THAT'S FINE TO COLD EXPOSURE IN THE FORM OF COLDSHOURS OR ICE BADS OR OUTSIDE A WITH MINIMAL A CLOTHING ON APPROPRIATE YET MINIMAL CLOTHING CAFFINE INGESTION A FASTING FOR INSTANCE A NOT INJESTING A CALERIES ALSO WILL LEND ITSELF TO INCREASE NOR UPAND AFFERAN DOPOMINE ET CETERA IF YOU ARE GOING TO CONSUME FOODS FOODS THAT ARE RICH IN THINGS LIKE TYROSINE WHICH IS A PRECURSOR FOR DOPOMINE YOU CAN LOOK UP WHICH FOODS ARE HIGH IN TYRASINE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN SUPPLEMENTATION AND LIKE TO USE THOSE ROUTS THINGS LIKE ALPHAG P C OR FENAL ETHELAMING THING OR EL TYROSINE IF THAT'S IN KEEPING WITH A WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO OF COURSE CONSULT YOUR DOCTER IF YOU'RE GOING TO A RELY ON SUPPLEMENTATION WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT WELL THE ALREADY ELEVATED NOR UP IN EFERON AN DOPOMINE THE SUNLIGHT EXERCISE COLD EXPOSURE CAPHINE TYROSINE ET CETERA ALL OF THOSE PLACE THE BRAIN AND BODY INTO A STATE IN WHICH YOU ARE BETTER ABLE OR I WOULD SAY MORE EASILY ABLE TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF LIMBIC FRICTION AND WHERE YOU NEED TO OVERRIDE THAT LIMBIC FRICTION IT WE'VE HEARD THAT THE MORNING IS KIND OF SACRED CONQUER THE HARDEST THINGS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE POPPSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE AND IN THE HABIT FORMATION LITERATURE MERELY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF GET IT OUT OF THE WAY ST YOU CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT HAVING DONE IT BUT WHAT I'M REFERRING TO HIS QUITE DIFFERENT WHAT I'M REFERRING TO AS A PARTICULAR PHASE OF DAY THAT AFTER RISING AFTER WAKING UP THAT IS FOR ZERO TO EIGHT HOURS RIGHT IN THAT FIRST PHASE YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS ACTION AND FOCUS ORIENTED AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOUARE ACTION AND FOCUS ORIENTED AND BECAUSE OF THE NEUROCHEMICALS THAT ARE NATURALLY RELEASED IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT YOU WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO OVERCOME ANY LIMBIC FRICTION THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF PERFORMING PARTICULAR HABITS SO AS YOU LIST OUT OR THINK ABOUT THE VARIOUS HABITS THAT YOU LIKE TO ADOPT IN YOUR LIFE TAKE THE HABITS FOR WHICH YOU KNOW THERE'S THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF LIMBIC FRICTION THEY ARE THE HARDEST FOR YOU TO ENGAG IN THEY REQUIRE THE MOST ACTIVATION ENERGY AND PUT THOSE IN THIS ZERO TO EIGHT HOURS AFTER WAKENG THIS WILL GREATLY FACILITATE YOUR PERFORMANCE OF THOSE NEW HABITS I'M CERTAIN OF THAT AND IN ADDITION TO THAT BY DOING THEM IN THIS PARTICULAR PHASE OF THE DAY NOT NECESSARILY AT THE SAME TIME I MAN IF YOU WANT TO BE VERY HABITUAL AN YOU WANT TO DO YOU'RE THE EXERCISE OR THE SUNLIGHT VIEWING ALWAYS AT THE SAME TIME OR YOU WANT TO DO AT YOU WANT TO DRINK YOUR CAFFINE ALWAYS AT THE EXACTING COME THAT'S FINE BUT BY PLACING THEM IN THITS BROADER WINDOW OF OF ZERO TO EIGHT HOURS AFTER WAKING WHAT YOURE DOING IS YOUR CREATING TASK BRACKETING YOU'RE MAKING IT SUCH THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WILL PREDICT WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO LEAN IN AGAINST LMBIC FRICTION IN ORDER TO PERFORM PARTICULAR TYPES OF HABITS AND THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SAYING I'M ALWAYS GOING TO RUN OR I'M ALWAYS GOING TO STUDY FROM TEN TO TWELVE A M EVERY MORNING THAT'S GREAT AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT TERRIFIC BUT THE LITERATARY INDICATES THAT PEOPLE WHO DO THAT WHO ARE VERY RIGID ABOUT WHEN THEY DO THINGS T END ECAUSE OF CONTEXT DEPENDENTS TO NOT NECESSARILY STICK TO THOSE HABITS OVERTIME SOME PEOPLE DO BUT MANY MANY PEOPLE DON'T SO THINK ABOUT THE HARDEST HABITS TO FORM AND THE THE HABITS THAT YOU MOST WANT OF FORM THAT ARE HARDEST FOR YOU TO ADOPT AND TO MAINTAIN AND I'S HIGHLY SUGGEST PLACING THOSE SOMEWHERE WITHIN THIS PHASE ONE OF ZERO TO IGHT HOURS AFTER WAKING NOW OF COURSE SOME OF THE THINGS I LISTED OUT SUNLIGHT VIEWING EXERCISE COLD EXPOSURE HI CAFFINE FASTING THOSE MIGHT BE THE ACTUAL HABITS THEMSELVES BUT HERE I REALIZE OR I RATHER I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF ARE DOING SUM ARE ALL OF THESE THINGS ALREADY AND MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF ARE TRYING TO ADOPT NEW HABITS THAT DON'T FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF JUST TRYING TO SET YOUR OVER ALL STATE AGAIN NOR UP ANEFFRAN DOPAMINE AND ALTHAYS NERAL SYSTEMS WILL BE GREATLY ELEVATED IN THIS ZERO TO EIGHT HOURS AFTER WAKENG HOWEVER THE OTHER THINGS I MENTION SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE EXERCISE COLD EXPOSURE CAFFINE FASTING IF THAT'S FOR YOU OR IF YOU'R EATING DURING THAT PHASE EATING THINGS THAT CONTAIN SOME OR ELEVATED LEVELS OF TYRACENE MAY BE SUPPLEMENTING ALPIT G P C OR EL TYRICINE AT CETERA ALL OF THOSE THINGS FURTHER FACILITATE THE NERO CHEMISTRY AND THEREFORE THE STATE OF MIND THAT'S GOING TO BE IDEAL FOR LEANING INTO LIMBIC FRICTION AND OVERITING THAT LIMBIC FRICTION SO THAT YOU CAN REGULARLY PERFORM THAT HABIT WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS LEVERAGING NORAL SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO HELP YOU MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE AND MAINTAIN A PARTICULAR HABIT SO WHAT I'M REFERRING TO AS PHASE ONE OF EACH DAY IS USEFUL FOR ACQUIRING CERTAIN HABITS BUT THERE ARE OTHER PHASES OF THE DAY AND THOSE TURN OUT TO BE US FUL FOR ACQUIRING OTHER TYPES OF HABITS FACE TOO AS I MENTION IS ABOUT AGAIN YOUSE AREN'T SPECIFICS BUT ABOUT NINE TO FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN HOURS AFTER WAKING DURING THIS PHASE OF THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE CIRCADIAN SHIFTS IN OUR BIOLOGY THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMIN AND NORUP AND EFFRAN THAT CIRCULATING IN OUR BRAIN AND BLOODSTREAM TENDS TO START TO COME DOWN AND LEVELS OF CORTES ALL TEND TO START TO COME DOWN AS THE IDEAL CERCUMSTANCE IN FACT YOU DON'T REALLY WANT ELEVATED CARTIS ALL LATE I THE DAY THAT'S IKCLY A SIGNATURE OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND NUMBER OF OTHER UNFORTUNATE THINGS SO NINE TO FOURTEEN HOURS AFTER WAKING DOPEMING IN NOROPAND EFFERAN AND CORTUS ALL ARE STARTING TO TAPER DOWN JUST NATURALLY AND A DIFFERENT NEURMODULATOR SERATONAN IS STARTING TO RISE SERATONAN IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE HIGHEST IN THIS SECOND HALF OF THE DAY AND TENDS TO LENDS ITSELF TO A MORE RELAXED STATE OF BEING NOW OF COURSE I DO REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE LESS OF MORNING PEOPLE AND FIND THAT THEY REALLY COME ALIVE AND AWAKE IN THE AFTERNOON BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY MOST PEOPLE FEAR MORE ALERT EARLY IN THE DAY EVEN ANXIOUS EARLY IN THE DAY AND THEN AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES THEY TEND TO BE A BIT MORE SLEEPY A BIT MORE RELAXED A BIT MORE CALM THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE ALL CANNON SHOULD DO DURING THIS PHASE TOO OF EACH DAY THAT LEND THEMSELVES TO A STATE OF MIND AND A STATE OF BODY THAT IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE GENERATION AND CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF HABITS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS FIRST OF ALL AS THE DAY GOES ON YOU SHOULD TRY IF YOU CAN TO START TAPERING THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT THAT YOU'R VIEWING NOW THIS DOESN'T MEAN PUTTING YOURSELF INTO DIM LIGHT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THATS CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE SIMPLY THAT YOU WANT TO START TAPERING OFF THE AMOUNT OF REALLY BRIGHT LIGHT THAT YOU'RE GETTING UNLESS IT SUNLIGHT TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE ON THE PODCASP BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD VIEWING THE SUN AS IT'S IT WHAT WE CALL LOW SOLAR ANGLE SO AS ITS HEADED TOWARD THE HORIZON YOUN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO WATCH THE SUNSET ALTHOUGH THAT CAN BE NICE BUT GETTING SOME SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL FOR A NUMBER OF BRAIN SYSTEMS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYSTEMS SO YOU CAN GET SOME SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES YOU CAN I CERTAINLY HAVE ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS ON BUT YOU WANT TO START DIMMING THOSE LIGHTS AND BRINGING THEM ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY LOWER IN THE ROOM BECAUSE THE NURANS IN YOUR EYE THAT VIEW THE UPPER VISUAL FIELD THEY ACTUALLY TRIGGER THIS ALERTNESS MECHANISM IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY EVEN IF YOUR HUMMING ROUND AND DOING WORK AT THREE AND FOUR OR FIVE OR EVEN SEVEN P M YOU ARE PROBABLY HEADED TOWARDS SLEEP A FEW HOURS LATER SO THINGS LIKE LIMITING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LIGHT IF YOU CAN THINGS LIKE ANESTYARE NON SLEEP DEEP REAST ANOTHER A THING THAT'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS PODCAS IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THIS BEFORE NON SLEEP DEEP REASS IS AN UMBRELLA TERM FOR THINGS LIKE MEDITATION FOR YOGANEDRA VERY POWERFUL AM SCIENCE SUPPORTED TOOL FOR TEACHING YOU HAW TO RELAX THINGS LIKE SELF HYPNOSIS WHICH MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE KUKI TO SOME OF YOU BUT ACTUE AS A CLINICALLY BASE TOOL FOR WHICH THEREIS A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IFYOURE INTERESTED IN THAT THERE'S A GREAT FREE RESOURCE CALLED REVERIE R E V E R I DOT CALM THERE'S A AP FOR BOTH APPLE AND ANDROID THIS IS AN ALF THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY COLLEGUES OF MINE IN RESEARCHES AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN YOU CAN DO THESE SHORT FIFTEEN MINUTE SELF HYPNOSIS SCRIP SAYS THEY'RE CALLED THAT CAN TEACH YOU HAW TO RELAX YOURSELF THERE'S EVEN ONES FOR FOCAS FOR SLEEP FOR CHRONIC PAIN AGAIND ALL VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY QUALITY PURE REVIEW LITERATURE SO THINGS LIKE REVERIE MEDITATION THINGS LIKE HEAT AND SANA HOP BATHS HOT SHOWERS THOSE ARE TERRIFIC AT THINGS TO DO IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY THEY TEND TO SUPPORT THIS SERATORNERGIC OR HIGH CERETONE AND LAX STATE AND LEND THEMSELVES TO MORE CALM AND RELAXATION FOR THOSE OF YEITHER INTERESTIN SUPPLEMENTATION THEREIS ALWAYS ASCHEAGANDA WHICH OM REDUCES CORTUS ALL AGAIN PIKS IN CORTUS ALL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON IN EVENING ARE ASSOCIATE WITH DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND SO FORTH ASCHUAGANDA AS A PRETTYPOTENT A CORTESALL INHIBITING TOOL A I PERSONALLY DON'T USE IT VERY OFTEN AND I CAUTION PEOPLE ABOUT USING IT FOR LONGER THAN TWO WEEK PERIODS OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING SOME BREAKS A YOU CAN LOOK UP MORE ABOUT ASCHUAGANDA ON EXAMINE NOT CALM THERE'S A LOT OF TERRIFIC LITERATURE WITH LINKS TO STUDIES THERE BUT BASICLY THIS PHASE TO OF THE DAY IS ONE IN WHICH YOURE ALERT YOU ARE PRESENT YOU ARE WORKING YOU ARE ENGAGING SOCIALLY YOUR COOKING DINNER PROBABLY PAYING ATTENTION TO A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY BE TRYING TO TAPER OFF YOUR STRESS LEVEL SO HOW DO YOU LEVERAGE PHASE TOO OF THE DAY FOR HABIT FORMATION WETL GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE NAURO CHEMISTRY OF LEARNING IN MEMORY GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TASK FORMATION AND ITS RELIANCE ON CERTAIN FORMS OF NEROL PLASTICITY THIS SECOND HALF THE DAY IS A TERRIFIC TIME TO TAKE ON HABITS AND THINGS THAT YOURE ALREADY DOING THAT REQUIRE VERY LITTLE OVERRIDE OF LIMBIC FRICTION SO THESE MIGHT BE THINGS THAT YOU COULD CATEGRIZE A IN COMMON TERMS THIS KIND OF MELOWER ACTIVITIES IT MIGHT BE JOURNALLING IT MIGHT BE A THAT YOU ALREADY ARE PERFORMING MUSIC OR I SHOULDS A PRACTICING MUSIC REGULARLY BUT THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR TYPE OF MUSIC THAT IS HARD FOR YOU ARE THAT YOU'R WORKING ON A PARTICULAR PIECE OF MUSIC OR YOUR TRING TO LEARN A LANGUAGE SOMETHING IS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING BUT DOESN'T REQUIRE A TON OF ENERGY IN ORDER TO OVERRIDE THAT LIMBIC FRICTION THES SECOND HALF THE DAY IS A MUCH BETTER TIME TO DO THAT LESS RESISTANCE AS WE MIGHT SAY BUT OF COURSE RESISTANCE HAS A NERAL SUBSTRATE AND THE REASON FOR DOING THOSE THINGS IN THE SECON PART OF THE DAY THE SO CALLED FASE TO AS IE CALLED IT PART OF THE DAY IS BECAUSE YOUR ABILITY TO OVERRIDE RESISTANCE IS REALLY DIMINISHED IN THIS SECOND PHASE OF THE DAY SOME OF YOU MIGHT SAY WON'T WAIT I LIKE TO EXERCISE IN THE SECOND A HALF OF THE DAY THAT'S ACTUALY WHEN I HAVE THE MOST ENERGY THAT'S WHEN I'M I FEEL WARMER I'M NOT A MORNING EXERCISE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE WHAT I AM REFERRING TO IS THE ACQUISITION OF NEW BEHAVIORS AND PLACING THOSE CONSISTENTLY AT THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY IN ORDER TO ENGAGE THIS TASK BRACKETING MECHANISMS I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ONE OF THE HOLMARK FEATURES OF THOSE BAZIL GANGLEA CIRCUITS FOR GO AND NO GO IS THAT THEY ARE SOCIATE WITH CERTAIN NERO CHEMICALS DOPOMINE AND CERATONA AN A SEATO COLLING AND OTHER NERCHEMICALS AND BY PLACING PARTICULAR HABITS HAT PARTICULAR PHASES OF THE DAY THOSE NEURO CHEMICAL STATES START TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEANING IN AND THE PROCESS OF BEGINNING END AS I MENTION ENDING THOSE PARTICULAR HABITS AND IN DOING SO THEY SHIFT THE WHOLE NERVOUS SYSTEM TOWART BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AT PARTICULAR TIMES OF DAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE LEANING VERY HARD AGAINST LIMIT FRICTION EARLY IN THE DAY AND PASE ONE AND THAT YOU RE GOING TO BE DOING THINGS THAT REQUIRE LESS CONSCIOUS OVERRIDE OF LIMIC FRICTION IN PACE TO AND IN DOING SO SET UP THIS TASK BRACKETING SYSTEM SO THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HABITS THAT YOUR LEARNING OR THATYOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN HAVE A MUCH GREATER PROBABILITY OF BEING EXECUTED AND CONSOLIDATED MEANING THAT PRETTY SOON THEY WILL JUST NATURALLY BECOME REFLECIVE AND AS WITH PHASE ONE MANY OF THE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED THAT SUPPORT THIS WHAT I'M CALLING A CERATORNERGIC STATE OR MORE RELAXED STATE IN PHASE TOO THINGS LIKE SEEING SOMELIT IN THE AFTERNOON BUT NOT A LOT OF RIGHT LIGHT FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES THINGS LIKE ANSTY ARE THINGS LIKE HEAT AND SANA A HOP BATHS ET CETERA ASHRAGONDA AGAIN ALL OF THOSE THINGS THEMSELVES COULD BE HABITS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADOPT I IN THAT CASE DO THOSE IF IF YOU LIKE TO EXPLORE THEM THEY ARE QUITE BENEFICIAL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I'M NOT JUST RELATED TO EXECUTION OF PARTICULAR HABITS IN FACE TWO OF THE DAY BUT ALSO FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF SLEEP AND CONSOLIDATING ANY LEARNING THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TRIGGERED EARLY IN THE DAY I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE BUT JUST BRIEFLY AS A RELEVANT ASIDE NEURO PLASTICITY INVOLVES TRIGGERING THE NEUROPLASTICY SETTING IT IN MOTION BUT THE ACTUAL REWUIRING OF THE BRAIN AND THE RECONFIGURATION OF NERANS THAT WILL ALLOW THAT LEARNING TO BE REFLEXIVE THAT ACTUALLY OCCURS DURING STATES OF DEEP REST LIKE AN STY ARE AND LIKE DEEP SLEEP AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT CAN ONLY EXERCISE AR PREFER TO EXERCISE IN PASE TWO OF THE DAY I NINE TO FOURTEEN HOURS OR FIFTEEN HOURS AFTER WAKING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP AND IN PARTICULAR DEEP SLEEP THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT FOR NOT JUST INOROPLASTICITY BUT RECOVERY OF MUCH MUSCLE AND OTHER TISSUES THAT ARE TAX DURING PHYSICAL EXERCISE IF YOU DO TRAIN AND PHASE DO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU START DOING SOME SORT OF ANESTIARTYPE ACTIVITY AFTER YOU TRAIN WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO BECAUSE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO TAPER DOWN AND RELAX SO THAT YOU CAN GET IN TO THE NEXT PHASE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS FACE THREE FASE THREE OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS SCHEDULE RUNS FROM ABOUT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER WAKING DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT BEING IN A STATE OF MI IND STATE OF BODY THAT ARE GOING TO A LOW NERO PLASTECITY TO OCCUR THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW THE REWIRING THAT YOU TRIGGERED DURING THE WAKING PART OF THE DAY TO ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE THOSE THINGS ARE VERY LOW TO NO LIGHT MEANING KEEPING YOUR ENVIRONMENT VERY DARK OR VERY VERY DIM I DON'T THING IT'S NECESSARY TO SLEEP IN A ROOM THAT'S COMPLETE BLACKNESS I THINK THAT'S A LOW BIT OVERKIL BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE KEEPING THE ROOM DARK AND KEEPING THE ROOM TEMPERATURE LOW IS VERY BENEFICIAL FOR GETTING AND STAYING IN DEEP SLEEP THE BODY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES IN ORDER TO GET INTO SLEEP AND TO STAY ASLEEP SO LOW LIGHT LOW TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN ALWAYS PILE ON BLANKETS OF COURSE IF YOU DON'T WANTO BE COLD AT NIGHT YOU WANT TO BE WARM ENOUGH BUT YOU WANT YOUR ENVIRONMENT TO BE COLD TYPICALLY PEOPLE AREN'T EATING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ALTHOUGH ONE THING THAT CAN BE USEFUL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'REAT LEAST WELL FED AND NOUG WHEN YOU HEAD INTO THIS THIRD PHASE OF EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY THAT YOU'RE NOT AWAKE BECAUSE YOU'RE HUNGRY NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE RECOMMEND PUTTING A GAP BETWEEN YOUR FINAL BITE OF FOOD AND WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT GAP SHOULD BE FOUR HOURS OTHER PEOPLE SAY TWO HOURS I YOUR ME I GENERALLY HAVE SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WITHIN TWO HOURS ARE NINETY MINUTES OF GOING TO SLEE BUT IT'S NOT A BIG MEAL BUT THAT'S JUST ME AND IV FALL SLEEP AND STAY ASLEEP FINE WITH THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPERIMENT FOR YOURSELF I'VE TALKED ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN SUPPORT SLEEP IN PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THE PODCAST THINGS LIKE MAGNESIUM THREE INATE OR MAGNESIUM BISGLICENATE THINGS LIKE THEANINE APIGENAN IF YOU LIKE TO READ MORE ABOUT THOSE WE ECTULLY HAVE A NEWS LETTER THAT ALL JUST QUICKLY REFER YOU TO THIS IS THE HUBERMEN LAB NURL NETWORK NEWS LETTER YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR IT BY GOING TO HUBERMAN LABDOK HOMETS VERY EASY TO FIND BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T SIGN UP YOU CAN GO TO THE TOOL KIT FOR SLEEP THAT'S LISSTED THERE AND THAT TOOL KIT IS NOT JUST SUPPLEMENTS THAT TOOL KIT IS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS BOTH BEHAVIOUROL AND SUPPLEMENT BASE AND NUTRITIAN BASED ET CETERA THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO GET INTO SLEEP AND TO STAY ASLEEP MORE READILY IT'S TOLYZERO COST YOU CAN FIND THAT GAIN AT HUBRMAN LABDOT CALM SO THNGS LIKE LOW LIGHT LOW TEMPERATURE THE SUPPLEMENTS I MENTION ADJUSTING YOUR EATING SCHEDULE APPROPRIATELY OBVIOUSLY NOT DRINKING CAFFINE IN THE MILL THE NIGHT OR TOO CLOSE TO BED THAT'S GOIN TO BE CRITICAL IN FACT IDEALLY YOU WOULDN'T INGEST ANY CAFFINE AND FACE TWO OF THE DAY SO THAT YOU COULD GET INTO THIS DEEPER STATE OF REST IN WHICH HABIT FORMATION IN NEURO PLASTO SLEEP CAN OCCUR WHAT IF YOU WAKE UP THE WAY I'VE CAST PASE THREE IS THAT YOURST MUST BE IN THIS DEEP SLUMBER YOU NOT SUPPOSE TO WAKE UP AT ALL S MUST BE IN LOW LIGHT AND YOUR BRAIN IS REWIRING AND THOSE HABITS ARE GETTING CONSOLIDATED ET CETERA WELL IF YOU LIKE ME YOUPROBABLY GET UP ONCE IN THE MILL THE NIGHT MAYBE YOU GO USED THE REST FROM PERFECTLY NORMAL PERFECTLY NORMAL BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE FALLING BACK ASLEEP VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU GET UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT TO USE A MINIMUM OF LIGHT IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE YOUR SURROUNDINGS JUST AS MUCH AS YOU NEED IN ORDER TO SAFELY DO SO BECAUSE LIGHT INHIBITS THE HORMON MELATONAN CAN MAKE IT VERY HARD TO FALL BACK TO SLEEP IF YOU INHIBIT MELETONAN THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT IN HIMITING MELETONEAR ACTULY VERY POTENT HAPPENS VERY VERY QUICKLY SO TRY AND KEEP THE LIGHT LOW AIN IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE FALLING BACK TO SLEEP THAT'S WHEN YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO USE SOMETHING LIKE THE REVERY AP THEY HAVE A SLEEP SCRIPT THERE THAT CAN HOPEFULLY HELP YOU GET BACK TO SLEEP OR SOMETHING LIKE ANSTIAR Y U CAN FIND ANSTIAR SCRIPTS ON YOU TWO OF THESE ARE ZERO COST YOU CAN LOOK UP ONE THAT I PARTICULAR LIKE AS ANSTIAR MADE FOR ITS A COMPANY AM ASSOCIATED WITH BUT THE NSTIARS COMPLETELY ZERO COST AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE THE OGANEDRA WHICH YOU CAN FIND SCRIPTS FOR ELSEWHERE AGAIN ALL OF THESE HABITS OR THESE BEHAVIORS THESE DUES AND DON'TS AROUND PHASE THREE THEMSELVES MIGHT BE TABITS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE FOR YOURSELF BUT AGAIN HASE THREE IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER LIMBIC FRICTION YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO OVERREYED IN PHASE ONE AND TRIGGER SOME NEW HABIT FORCING YOURSELF TO RIGHT OR FORCING YOURSELF TO STUDY OR FORCING YOURSELF TO EXERCISE DURING THAT HIGH LIMBIC FRICTION STATE AND THEN WHATEVER THINGS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IN PHASE TOO WHICH AR HABITS THAT HOPEFULLY HAVE MOVED A LITLE BIT FURTHER ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF NEWLY FORMED VER ALL THE WAY TO REFLECTIVE OR THINGS THAT TAKE LESS LIMBIC FRICTION IN ORDER TO DO PHASE THREE IS WHEN ALL OF THAT GETS REALLY LOCKED INTO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH THOSE HEAVY AND MECHANISMS LIKE ENEMDIA RECEPTORS ET CETERA THAT TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AGAIN NERRL PLASTICITY IS THE BASIS OF HABIT FORMATION AND NER PLASTICITY AND THE REWIRING OF NERL CIRCUITS HAPPENS IN THESE STATES OF DEEP SLEEP SO IF YOU'RE NOT OBEYING THIS PHASE THREE IF YOU'RE NOT GIVING PHASE THREE THE MATERIALS IT NEEDS AND YOUR AND YOU'RE NOT AVOIDING THE CERTAIN THINGS LIKE CAFINE AND BRIGHT LIGHT AND STRESS DURING PHASE THREE YOU'RE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THOSE HABITS THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO TRIGGER IN PHASE ONE AND FACE TWO OF THE DAY AGAIN THESE ARE THINGS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THE PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE BUT REALLY THIS IS ABOUT HABIT FORMATION AND THE WHOLE REASON FOR PLACING PARTICULAR TYPES OF BEHAVIORS AT PARTICULAR PHASES OF THE DAY IS TO SET A FRAME WORK FOR THAT TASK BRACKETING AGAIN TASK BRACKETING AND THOSE CIRCUITS OF THE BASOL GANGLIA INDICATE THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE NERRL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ENGAGED BY THE TASK ITSELF BUT THE NERRL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ENGAGED BE FOR AND AFTER THAT TASK EXECUTION THAT'S WHAT GETS CONSOLIDATED SO WHEN YOU DO THINGS THAT PARTICULAR PHASES OF THE DAY UNDER PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF NERO CHEMISTRY WHAT YOU'R DOING IS YOU'RE GIVING THE BRAIN A VERY PREDICTABLE SET OF SEQUENCES THAT DURING SLEEP IT CAN START TO PUT IN TO YOUR HARD DRIVE IF YOU WILL IT CAN REALLY PROGRAMMI INTO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO THAT WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME HOPEFULLY WITHIN EIGHTEEN OR MAYBE VEN SIX DAYS OR WHO KNOWS MAYBEVEN FEWER DAYS YOU'LL FIND THAT EXECUTING THOSE BEHAVIORS IS VERY VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD FOR YOU AND THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO FEEL SO MUCH LIMBIC FRICTION OR OVERREDE SO MUCH LIMBIC FRICTION SOME OF YOUARE PROBABLY ASKING O K IF I PERFORM A PARTICULAR HABIT DURING PHASE ONE AND THEN I DO OTHER HABITS DURING PHASE TO AND I EVENTUALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE I ENGAGING IN THOSE HABITS IN A PRETTY EFFORTLESS WAY DO I KEEP THEM IN THE SAME PHASE OF THE DAY AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THE LITERATURE SAYS IT DOESN'T MATTER AND IN FACT MOVING THAT PARTICULAR HABIT AROUND SOMEWHAT RANDOMLY CAN ACTUALLY BE BENEFICIAL TO YOU BECAUSE ACTUALLY MOVING IT FROM ONE TIME A DAY TO THE OTHER IS THAT CONTEXT INDEPENDENCE THAT WERE WE REALLY ARE SEEKING BY BEING ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING THAT WE WANT TO DO REGARDLESS OF TIME OF DAY OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S HOW WE KNOW THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED A REAL HABIT FORMATION THAT'S HOW WE KNOW THAT THE HABIT HAS BEEN MOVED INTO CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF OUR NARRAL CIRCUITRY THAT JUST ALLOWS TO DO T WHAT SEEMS LIKE REFLECIVELY ALTHOUGH EARLY ARE POINTED OUT THOT THESE AREN'T WREFLEXES IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THIS BRAIN AREA THE HYPPOCAMPUS THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW IS ASSOCIATE WITH LEARNING IND MEMORY IS NOT ACTUALLY WHERE MEMORIES ARE STORED THE HYPPOCAMPUS IS WHERE MEMORIES ARE FORMED IT'S WHERE PROCEDURES LIKE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE PROCEDUAL MEMORY OF HOW YOUARE GOING TO EXECUTE A PROCULAR SEQUENCE WHERE THAT'S MAINTAINED SO LIKE IF WE USE THE RECIPE MODEL THAT'S WHERE THE RECIPE IS MAINTAINED UNTIL YOU KNOW HOW TO COOK THAT DISH AND THEN THE PRECEDUAL MEMORY LITERALLY MIGRATES OFF INTO A DIFFERENT SET OF NARRAL CIRCUITS WHICH ARE THE NARL CIRCUITS OF THE NEO QUARTEX WHERE WE HAVE MAPS OF CENSURY EXPERIENCE MAPS OF A ALL KINDS OF EXPERIENCES INCLUDING MOTOR MAPS OF HA TO EXECUTE THING SO WE USE ONE PART OF THE BRAIN TO LEARN SOMETHING BUT THEN THAT INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF NURONS IS PASSED OFF TO A DIFFERENT BRAIN AREA NOW THE NURONS THEMSELVES DON'T MOVE FROM THE HYPPOCAMPUS TO THE QUARTEX THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SIGNALS THE SEQUENCE OF ELECTRICAL FIRING MUCH LIKE A A SCRIPT A FOR A MOVY OR THE NOTES ON A A SHEET OF PAPER  FOR A PARTICULAR MUSICAL PIECE IS TRANSFERRED OFF TO A DIFFERENT BRAIN AREA SO THAT WHOLE PROCESS OF REALLYLEANING INTO SOMETHING THAT'S HARD THEN IT BECOMING EASIER AND THEN EVENTUALLY THAT THING BECOMING MORE OR LESS REFLECIVE INVOLVES A MIGRATION OF THE INFORMATION IN THE BRAIN AND ONCE ITS MIGRATED OUT TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION IN THE BRAIN AT THAT POINT IT'S ACHIEVED CONTEXT INDEPENDENCE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BRACKETED BY AH YOU KNOW YOUR CAFFIN AND YOUR LUNCH IT DOESN'T HAVE TO OCCUR A IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOUR AFTERNOON ENESTY ARE BUT BEFORE YOUARE A FOUR OCLOCK MEETING ON ZOOM OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT SO ALL THIS IS TO SAY THAT ONE SOMETHING HAS BECOME REFLECIVE YOU SHOULD PLAY WITH IT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TIME OF DAY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT IN THE SAME PHASE OF DAY GREAT BUT IF YOU ONE DAY DECIDEUE AN EXERCISE IN THE AFTERNOON NEXT IT YOU SID YOU CAN EXERCISE IN THE MORNING AND THAT'S THE HABIT YOUR CONCERNED WITH THAT'S TERRIFIC IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THAT THAT MEANS THAT IT'S TRULY ACHIEVE CONTEXTS INDEPENDENCE IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE OFFICIALLY FORM THAT HABIT AN AS I MENTIO N EARLIER MUCH EARLIER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE THE STRENGTH OF A HABIT IS DICTATED BY HOW MUCH LIMBIC FRICTION THAT WAS ONE AND HOW MUCH CONTEXT DEPENDENCE THERE IS SO WHEN IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH ACTIVATION ENERGY TO GET INTO THE EXECUTION OF THAT HABIT AND YOU CAN DO IT IN ANY CONTEXT WELL THEN YOU HAVE FORMED A HABIT WE REALLY CAN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT LEARNING ANYTHING HABITS ARE OTHERWISE UNLESS WE TALK ABOUT REWARD PREDICTIONERROR REWARD PREDICTIONERROR IS ASSOCIATE WITH THE MOLECULE DOPAMINE ALTHOUGH I SHOULD SAY THERE ARE OTHER NORCHEMICALS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT ARE ALSO RELATED TO REWARD PREDICTIONERROR BUT REWARD PREDICTIONERROR IS A VERY GOOD SYSTEM OR I SHOULD SAY LENDS THROUGH WHICH TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD REWARD OURSELVES FOR PERFORMING A GIVEN HABIT A THIS IS A MUCH LARGER DISCUSSION THAT ACTUALLY RELATES TO THINGS LIKE PARENTING AIN SELF REGULATION YOU KNOW SHOULD WE REWARD KIDS JUST FOR EFFORT  SHOULD WE REWARD OURSELVES JUST FOR EFFORT WHAT SHOULD WE REWARD HOW MUCH SHOULD WE REWARD OURSELVES WHEN SHOULD WE WITHDRAW REWARD SHOULD WE USE PUNISHMENT THESE KINDS OF THINGS IS IS A VAST LITERATURE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO ALL THE DETAILVES BUT THE NOTION OF REWARD PREDICTIONERROR IS SO POWERFUL THAT IT CAN PREDICT MOST IF NOT ALL FORMS OF LEARNING INCLUDING HABIT FORMATION AND YOU CAN DEPLOY OR USE PARTICULAR FEATURES OF REWARD PREDICTIONAR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REENFORCE OR EXCELERATE THE FORMATION OF CERTAIN HABITS SO REWARD PREDICTIONERROR QUITE SIMPLY IS IF YOU EXPECT A REWARD AND THE REWARD COMES A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH GENERATING THAT REWARD IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR AGAIN THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD HOWEVER THE AMOUNT OF REWARD IN THE FORM OF THE SMOLECULE DOPAMIN THAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE IS EVEN GREATER IF A REWARD ARRIVES THAT'S UNEXPECTED SLE ME REPEAT THAT AGAIN IF I THINK THAT SOMETHING'S COMING THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT THAT I LETS SAY I LEAN INTO A HABIT I MANAGE TO OVERRIDE MY LIMBIC FRICTION AND A DOING MY FORTY FIVE MINUTES A WRITING IN THE MORNING WITH NO PHONE AND KNOWING TURNAD AND I'M GETTING TOWARD THE END AND I'M ANTICIPATING HOMACTUALLY DOING THIS IS IS GREAT I DID IT I'M FEELING REALLY REALLY GOOD I FINISH I DEFINITELY WILL RECEIVE A DOPAMEN REWARD I'LL MAKE MY OWN DOPAMEN REWARD THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM REMEMBERS THIS IS ALL INTERNAL HOWEVER I WILL ALSO RECEIVE DOPAMINE REWARD IF UNEXPECTEDLY SOMETHING POSITIVE HABINTS AND TIPICALLY IF SOMETHING UNEXPECTED BUT POSITIVE HABINS THE AMOUNT OF DOPIN OUR REWARD THAT WE GET IS ACTUALLY MUCH GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER CONDITIONS HOWEVER IT'S HARD TO SURPRISE YOURSELF ABOUT A BEHAVIOR THAT YOURE DELIBERATELY ENGAGING IN SO THAT BECOMES A BIT OF A TRICKY ONE REWARD PREDICTIONERROR ALSO SAYS THAT IF WE EXPECT A REWARD AND THE REWARD DOESN'T COME THAT THE PATTERN OF DOPAMING RELEASE WILL FOLLOW A PARTICULAR CONTOUR AND THAT CONTROR IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE'S HOW IT GOES LETS SAY THAT I'M WRITING AND I'M ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY FIVE MINUTES IN THING OUT THIS IS GREAT I'M ACTULLY I MAN SHOULD DO THIS I SUCCEEDING IN IN  EXECUTING THE BEHAVIORS THAT I NEED TO IN ORDER TO PERFORM THIS HABIT I'M OVERRIDING LIMBIC FRICTION JUST THAT SERIES OF THOUGHTS WILL START TO GENERATE THE DOPAMIN RELEASE WITHIN MY BRAIN AND BODY HOWEVER IF AT THE FIFTY MINUTE MARK THE PHONE RINGS AND I PICK UP THE PHONE OR I BREAK MY OWN PROTOCAL AND BREAK MY OWN SELF DISCIPLINE AND I GO ON IN CHECK SOCIAL MEDIAOR I DO SOMETHING THAT TAKES ME OUT OF THAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT MY LEVEL OF DOPAMIN IS ACTUALLY GOING TO DROP BELOW THE BASE LINE MEANING BELOW THE LEVEL OF DOPAMING I HAD BEFORE I EVEN STARTED THE HABIT EXECUTION  SO WHAT THIS IS IS THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT PREDICTS WEATHER NOT REWARDS ARE GOING TO COME WHEN WE THINK A REWARD IS GOING TO COME IT STARTS TO ACTUALLY ARRIVE EARLIER IN THE FORM OF DOPAMING RELEASE THIS IS THE FEELING THAT WE EXPERIENCE AS IN POSITIVE ANTICIPATION YOU TELLIC IT HEY WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK ARE RE GING TO GO GET ICE CREAM THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE ICE CREAM YET THEY'RE NOT AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK BUT THE'RE EXCITED THE DOPAMING RELEASE COMES EARLIER THEY GET TO THE AMUSEMENT PARKER THEY GET THE ICE CREAM THEY WILL ALSO HAVE SOME DOPAMIN RELEASE ASSOCIATE WITH THAT BUT MOST OF IT BELIEVE IT ARE NOT CAME IN THE FORM OF THE ANTICIPATION AND DOPAMINE HAS SOME QUALITIES THAT MAKE THE ACTUAL ICE CREAM IN THE ACTUAL AMUSEMENT PARK EXIPERIENCE MORE PLEASUREFUL THAN IT WOULD BE HAD THAT DOPEN YOUR RELEASE NOT HAPPEN OF COURSE THE OTHER WAY TO DO IT IS TO SURPRISE THA KID YOU TELL THEM LISTEN WE'RE GOING TO THE A CLASS THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY HATE ORGANI O SEE THE PERSON THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY DESPISE THAN YOU DRIVE THEM THE AMUSEMENT PARK THAT'S THE BIG RELEASE OF DOPAMINE BUT REWARD PREDICTIONRY ALSO SAYS THAT IF YOU TELL THE KID OR YOURSELF O' GAY WERE HAD TO THE AMUSEMENT PARKREN AND GET SOME ICE CREAM THAT REALLY REALLY EXCITE AND HE GET THERE AND ITS CLOSED WERETHERE NOT LETTING ANY MORE PEOPLE IN WELL THEN THE DOAMING LEVEL DROPS WAY BELOW WHAT IT WAS BEFORE YOU TOLD THEM THAT YOU ARE HEADED THERE  I'VE GIING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXAMPLESTHAT HOPEFULLY MAKE THIS CLEAR REWARD PREDICTIONARY GOVERNS VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF EFFORT AND ALL ASPECTS OF LEARNING WHY BECAUSE WHEN DOPAMINE IS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THE NERL CIRCUITS OF OUR BRAIN ABODY CHANGE THERE'S A STATE CHANGE OUR OVER LEVE AR SCUSEME OUR OVERALL LEVEL OF ENERGY BUT ALSO THE SORTS OF SENSORY EVENTS THAT WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO CHANGES WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF DOPAMINE IN OUR SYSTEM YOU CAN LEVERAGE THIS FOR HABIT FORMATION THINK BACK TO TASK BRACKETING THINK BACK TO LIMBIC FRICTION IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING ADOPTING A NEW HABIT OR IF YOU ARE TRYING TO P BREAK A HABIT SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT BUT WE WILL IN A MOMENT IT'S VERY USEFUL TO THINK NOT JUST ABOUT THE PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUT ALSO THINK ABOUT THET EVENTS THAT PRECEDE AND FOLLOW THAT PARTECULAR HABIT AND THE EXECUTION OR AT LEAST THE EFFORT TO EXECUTE THAT HABIT WHAT YOUR DOING IS YOUR CASTING A KIND OF A SPOT LIGHT OR AROUND A BIN OF TIME ERE A SET OF EVENTS FOR WHICH DOPOMENE CAN BE ESSOCIATED WHAT IS THIS LOOK LIKE IN THE PRACTICAL SENSE WELL AGAIN I'LL JUST TRY AND USE VERY SIMPLE CONCRETE EXAMPLES BUT THIS COULD CARRYOVER TO ANYTHING LET'S SAY I WERE SOMEBODY YOU HAS A HARD TIME GETTING IN THAT THIRD ET A SIXTY MINUTES OF ZONE TO CARDIOF ASCULAR EXERCISE MIDMORNING THIS IS ACXTUALLY AN ISSUE FOR ME I MUCH PREFER TO DOUR RESISTANCE EXERCISED HAN CARDVASCULAR EXERCISE ALL THEGH ONCE I DO IT I ALWAYS FEEL MUCH BETTER THAT I HAVE DONE IT WHAT I SHOULD DO IS POSITIVELY ANTICIPATE THE ONSET AND THE OFFSET OF THAT SESSION RIGHT SO THINKING ABOUT LEANING IN TO THE EFFORT GOING OUT IND DOING THAT ZONE TO CARDIOSECTION AND I SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW I'M GOING TO FEEL AFTER SO NOT JUST THINK ABOUT HOW GREAT I'M GOING TO FEEL AFTER BUT ALSO THING ABOUT HOW HARD IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN TRYING TO REWARD MYSELF SUBJECTIVELY FOR THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE ANOTHER WORDS START REWARDING TASK BRACCETING IN ADDITION TO REWARDING THE EXECUTION OF THE HABIT ITSELF NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE SAYING WAT WAIT THIS IS ALL SELF TALK THIS IS JUST POSITIVE SELF TALK BUT IT'S NOT POSITIVESELF TALK IT'S NOT SAYING AH YOU KNOW I FEEL SO GREAT ABOUT DOING SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HATE YOU CAN'T LIDE YOURSELF OR YOU'RE WELCOME TO LAD YOURSELF BUT THE NURSINS LITERATURE OF THE LITERATURE OF GROWTH MINDS TAT ALL THE LITERATURE BASICALLY OF MIND THAT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU LIED YOURSELF YOU KNOW YOUR LYING AND YOU ACTUALLY SET UP THE OPPOSITE OF A  REWARD SYSTEMS YOU HAVE TO BE BRUDALLY HONEST WITH YOURSELF THAT FOR INSTANCE I DON'T LIKE INITIATING THIS CARDY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE BUT I DO LIKE THE FACT THAT I'VE DONE IT AFTER I'VE DONE IT SO WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS YOU ARE APPLYING REWARD PREDICTION ERROR TO THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF THINGS THAT'S INVOLVED IN GETTING INTO THE HABIT EXECUTION GETTING THROUGH THE HABIT EXECUTION AND GETTING OUT OF THE HABIT EXECUTION HOW DO YOU DO THIS WELL I TAKE US BACK TO OUR PROEDURAL MEMORY VISUALIZATION EXERCISE IF WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHEN I TALKED ABOUT IT IN THAT CONTACTS I TALKED ABOUT WALKING THROUGH MENTALLY THE SERIES OF STEPS THAT'S REQUIRED TO PERFORM OUR PARTICULAR HABITS ON THE CASE OF THE ZONE TO CARDIO THING IT WOULD BE O CABIN O PUT ON MY SHOES THAN I'MN HEAD OUT THE DOOR THAN I'MHN TO DRIVE UP THE ROW THERE'S PARTICULAR CANYON YOUR HERE THAT IF I'M GOING TO RUN I I HAPPEN A LIKE RUNNING OR I DON'T HATE RUNNING ENOUGH THAT I TEND TO DO IT GOING THROUGH THAT HEADING BACK ET CETERA ET CETERA THAT'S GREAT BUT EVEN BETTER WOULD BE TO BROAD IN THE TIME BEN AND START TO POSITIVELY ANTICIPATE THE PERIOD HEADED INTO THE HABIT SO EVEN BEFORE YOU PUT ON YOUR SHOES THE FACT THAT YOU ARE SUCCESSFULLY PLACING THE HABIT IN IN THIS CASE FAZSE ONE OF THE DAY AND THAT AFTERWARDS I'M GOING TO FEEL A PARTICULAR SET OF POSITIVE BENEFITS ELEVATED MOOD AT CETERA I LIKE BEING HUNGRY AND TOBELY AFTER EXERCISE I'M HUNGRY SO I LIKE BEING HUNGRY CAUSE I LIKE EATING AND SO THERE'S A WHOLE SET OF THINGS THAT LINK UP WITH ONE ANOTHER SO 'M NOT JUSTHING ABOUT HABIT EXECUTION AS THIS ISOLATED LITTLE SET OF EVENTS OR THIS LITTLE TIME BIN BUT RATHER I'M DRAWING A LARGER ENVELOPE AROUND IT AND STARTING TO POSIVELY ASSOCIATE DOPA MEN REWARD WITH THAT LARGER ENVELOPE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THERERE THINKING WIETE THIS IS JUST A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRICK YOU KNOW YOU CON THIS IS SORTER LIKE LINE YOURSELF IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY CONTRADICTING THE FACT THAT SOME OF THIS IS UNPLEASANT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE TAKING THIS ENTIRE SERIES OF EVENTS WHAT I'M CALLING THIS KIND OF TIME ENVELOPE AND YOUR ASSOCIATING IT WITH A PARTICULAR REWARD THAT COMES LATER WHICH FOR ME WOULD BE THE FEELING THAT AH YOU KNOW THAT I'VE COMPLETED THIS RIKE ASE FOR ME THAT'S USUALLY GOOD FEELING SO REWARD PREDICTION ERROR IS BEAUTIFUL NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S A SORT OF MATH OF ANTICIPATION AND REWARD OR A MATH OF ANTICIPATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT IT'S BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN STRETCH OUT OR MAKE MORE NARROW THE TIME BINS IN WHICH REWARD PREDICTIONARE WORKS REWARD PREDICTIONERE IS THE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE NAVIGATE FOR YOAR DEGREES OR HIHT I MEAN YOU GO SHORE FINAL EXAM TO FINAL EXAM ET CETERA BUT ULTIMATELY THRE'S A BIG PAY OFF AT THE END AND IT'S ALL BASICALLY FOR THAT BIG PAY OFF AND OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S THE JOURNEY NOT THE DESTINATION BUT LET'S FACE IT FOR A LOT OF US GOALS AND HABITS ARE ABOUT ACHIEVING SOME SORT OF DESTINATION IN THE CASE OF ZONE TOO CARDIO FOR ME IT'S ABOUT TRY TO STAY ALIVE FOR AS LONG AS I CAN AM AS LONG ASE I CAN WITH VITALITY THAT IS AND IT'S ALSO THE FACT THAT IF I'M DOING THAT I GET TO EAT AH THE FOODS THAT I LIKE I TEND TO BE ABLE TO EAT MORE WHICH I HAPPEN TO REALLY ENJOY EATING SO MUCH SO THAT ID LIKE IT JUST AS AN ACTIVITY SO BASICGLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS NOT RESTRICT YOUR THINKING TO JUST THE HABIT THAT YOU'RE TRYIN A FORM BUT RATHER TO GRAB A HOLD OF THE TIMING BEFORE AND AFTER THAT PARTICULAR HABIT AND START TO POSIVELY ASSOCIATE REWARD MECHANISMS IN YOUR BRAID WITH THAT ENTIRE TIME BIN THIS IS A VERY USEFUL AND VERY POWERFUL TOOL IN ORDER TO FORM HABITS AND I SHOULD SAY THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT COMES NATURALLY TO MOST PEOPLE IN FACT EVEN AS I DESCRIBE IT YOU MIGHT FIND ITS DISTILL LOBID ABSTRACT BUT WHAT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO IF YOU ARE FINDING IT TO BE A LITTLE BIT VAGUE WOULD BE TO PICK THE HABIT YOU WANT A FORM WRITE DOWN OR THINK ABOUT VERY CONCRETELY WHAT IS THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS INVOLVED IN THE EXECUTION OF THAT HABIT AND THEN WRITE DOWN OR THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT NEED TO PRECED THAT HABIT MAY BE THE IMMEDIATE TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE AS WELL AS THE IMMEDIATE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND OR FEELINGS THAT WILL OCCUR AFTER THAT HABIT AND THEND CALL THE WHOLE THING A HABIT EXECUTION THE WHOLE THING A EFFORT TO ENGAGE IN THAT PARTICULAR HABIT AND IN DOING THAT AND IN POSIVELY ASSOCIATING WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE GOING TO COMPLETE THAT ENTIRE SEQUENTS YOU WILL ENGAGE REWA RED PREDICTION ERROR IN THE PROPER WAY THAT THE DOPAMINE SERGE CAN LEND ITSELF TOWARD MOTIVATION BECAUSE ULTIMATELY DOPAMING IS NOT ABOUT FEELING GOOD ITS ABOUT FEELING MOTIVATED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IAVE TALKED ABOUT NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE BUT DOPAMINE CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF IS NOT A REWARD MOLECULE AS MUCH AS IS A MOLECULE OF MOTIVATION AND DRIVE AND THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF DOING THE EXERCISE I  JUST DESCRIBED OF WRITING THINGS OUT THAT PRECEED ARE INVOLVED IN THE IMMEDIATE EXECUTION OF THE HABIT AND FOLLOW THE HABIT WILL ALLOW YOU TO EXPERIENCE AND INCREASE IN ENERGY AND THEREBY AN INCREASE IN LIKELIHOOD THAT YOURE GOING TO ENGAGE IN THAT ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT DOPAMING GIVES US ENERGY AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE MOLECULE EPINEFFERON A DRENDOLIN IS ACTING MANUFACTURED FROM DOPAMIN BYACHEMICALLY IT COMES FROM DOPAMI SO DOPAMING IS POWERFUL AND YOU CAN ACCESS MORE DOPARINE AROUND EVEN HABITS THAT YOU HABINT YET FORMED BY TAKING THIS BROADER TIME ENVELOPE AND TASK BRACKETING THAT SPECIFIC TASK EXECUTION OR HABIT EXECUTION WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE I PROMISE TO YOU THAT I WOULD DELIVER TWO PROGRAMS THAT ARGURED TOWARDS HABIT FORMATION AND I PROMISE THAT I WOULD GIVE YOU WAYS IN WHICH YOU COULD GAUGE WHETHER NOT CERTAIN HABITS HAD MOVED FROM HIGH EFFORT WHEN I CALL HIGHLYMBIC FRICTION TO REFLECTSIVE WE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER WAYS TO GAUGE THAT IN RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE I FOUND A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS FOR HABIT FORMATIONIT'S REALLY AMAZING HOW MUCH IS OUT THERE THERE ONES AS SIXTY DAYS TO THIS ARE TWENTY ONE DAYS TO THAT OR EIGHTEEN DAYS TO THAT SOMETHING IS JUST RAMPANT IN THE POPULAR PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE AND IN THE SELF HELP LITERATURE I WANT A SPELL OUT A PARTICULAR SYSTEM THAT I THINK TO BE VERY USEFUL TO MOST IF NOT ALL PEOPLE THAT ROOTED IN THE BIOLOGY OF HABIT FORMATION ROOTED IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HABIT FORMATION AND THAT IS ENTIRELY COMPATIBLE WITH THAT PHASE ONE PHASE TO PASE THREE TYPEPROGRAM THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT ENCOMPASSES A BIT OF A LONGER TIME SCALE AND REALLY ARRIVES AT AT KIND OF A SYSTEM IF YOU WILL FOR HOW TO BUILD IN HABITS AND THEN TO TEST WHETHER NOT THOSE HABITS HAVE REALLY STUCK AND WHETHER NOT THER LIKELY TO STICK GOING FORWARD AND SO THIS IS AT LEAST FOR SAKE OF THIS EXAMPLE A TWENTY ONE DAY SYSTEM I PICK TWENTY ONE DAYS BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE AVERAGE OR MOST TYPICAL SYSTEM FOR ENGAGING NERL PLASTICITY AS IT RELATES TO THE FORMATION OF NEW HABITS THIS TWENTY ONE DAY SYSTEM ACTUALLY IS ONE THAT SO ONE I KNOW VERY WELL USES AND IS USED FOR A LONG TIME AS SHE USE THEM A THEIR KIDS USE IT AS WELL AND IT HAS A CERTAIN ELEGANCE TO IT AND I THINK OM AS I DESCRIBE IT THAT ELEGANCE WILL WILL BEGIN TO REVEAL ITSELF SO BASIDLY WHAT THIS INVOLVES IS YOU SET OUT TO PERFORM SIX NEW HABITS PER DAY ACROSS THE COURSE OF TWENTY ONE DAYS WHY SIX AND WHY TWENTY ONE WEL WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT BUT THE A IDEAS YOU WRITE DOWN SIX THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO EVERY DAY FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS WHAT PHASE OF THE DAY THOSE THINGS FALL IN TO WELL THAT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THOSE EARLIER FASE ONE FAYE TWO FAYS THREE BUT FOR NOW TWENTY ONE DAYS SIX THINGS PER DAY HOWEVER THE EXPECTATION IS THAT YOU'LL ONLY COMPLETE FOR TO FIVE OF THOSE EACH DAY SO BUILT INTO THIS IS A KIND OF PERMISSION TO FAIL BUT IT'S NOT FAILURE BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS APPROACH TO FORMING HABITS IS BASE NOT SO MUCH ON THE SPECIFIC HABITS THAT YOU'RE TRIN OF FORM BUT THE HABIT OF PERFORMING HABITS RIGHT IT'S THE HABIT OF DOING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THINGS PER DAY SO YOU SET OUT TO PERFORM SIX NOW ANOTHER REASON FOR NOT NECESSARILY PERFORMING ALL SIX IS THAT SOME ACTIVITIES PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE PERFORMED EACH DAY FOR INSTANCE IN MY CASE IF I WERE TO WAIT TRAIN OR EVEN RUN EVERY DAY I'M OF THE SORT OR MYBIOLOGYIS OF THE SORT THAT I DON'T RECOVER SO WELL SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO RESISTANCE TRAINING EVERY DAY BUT I MIGHT WANT TO DO IT FOUR DAYS A WEEK FOR INSTANCE SO BY HAVING SIX THINGS IN THAT LIST COULD SHUFFLE OUT THAT PARTICULAR ACTIVITY ON PARTICULAR DAYS OF THE WEEK AND SIMPLY DO FOUR OR FIVE OTHER ACTIVITIES SO TWENTY ONE DAYS YOU LIST OUT FORTO FIVE THING SO IT MIGHT BE ZON TO CARDIO RESISTANCE TRAINING SUNLIGHT VIEWING OM WRITING I COULD BE JOURNALING IT COULD BE LEARNING A LANGUAGE MATHEMATICS AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO VARY DEPENDING ON YOUR PARTICULAR GOALS AN THE HABITS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE BUT NO MORE THAN SIX AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT YOU'RE NOT IN PERFORM MORE THAN FORTO FIVE IF YOU MISS A DAY MEANING YOU DON'T PERFORM FORTO FIVE THINGS THERE IS NO PUNISHMENT AND IN FACT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY TRYING DO WHAT IN THE LITERATURE IS CALLED A HABIT SLIP COMPENSATION WHICH IS JUST FANCY PSYCHOLOGICAL LANGUAGE FOR IF YOU SCREW UP AND YOU DON'T GET ALL FOUR OR FIVE IN ONE DAY YOU DON'T DO EIGHT THE NEXT DAY IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE THIS I SHUALLY BRINGS ME BACK TO AN EXAMPLE I HAD FROM GRADUATE SCHOL I REMEMBER WHEN I START GRADUATE SCHOOL FEELING VERY EXCITED BUT A LITTLE BIT OVERWHELMED BY THE AMOUNT OF THINGS THAT I HAD TO DO BECAUSE ID TO BOTH DO RESEARCH I WAS DOING COURCOURSE WORK AT THE TIME GRADUATES YOUTIN STIPENS AND STILL NOW UNFORTUNATELY WERE A DEPRESSINGLY LOW SO AS FINANCIALLY STRESSFUL THERE WERE NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPENING ANDI REMEMBER IT A NEUROLOGIST SO THA YOU SEE BERKLY REALLY FANTASTIC SCIENTIST AND PERSON IS NAME AS BOBNITE SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW HIM I REMEMBER HE I WENT TO HIM AND I ASK YOU WHAT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH SOME ONE ACTUALLY NAVIGATES GRADUATE SCHOOL SUCCESSFULLY AN AND HE SAID LISTEN YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING OR ENGAGING OR ROUTINE IN ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP UP CONSISTENTLY FOR AT LEAST FIVE AN IDEALLY SIX DAYS PER WEEK NO NO THAT'S PRETTY GOOD AND HE SAID EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS YOU MIGHT HAVE TO UPDATE THAT BUT YOU NION TO DECIDE WHAT YOU CAN DOU CONSISTENTLY WHAT YOU CAN DO EVERY DAY OR AT LEAST SIX DAYS A WEEK OR FIVE DAYS A WEEK ANTHAT WAS VERY VERY USEFUL TO ME AND IT FITS WEL WITH THIS NOTION OF HABITS SLIPS THAT IF YOU HAPPEN TO SCREW UP AND NOT BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN WHATEVER HABITS YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT THE NEXT DAY YOU JUST GET RIGHT BACK ON ON THE ON THE HORSE SO TO SPEAK HOWEVER THERE'S AE REALLY INTERESTING FEATURE FROM THE NOURL SCIENCE LITERATURE AND FROM THE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE THAT SAYS THAT CHUNKING THIS TWENTY ONE DAYS INTO TWO DAY BENS CAN BE VERY VERY USEFUL WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE UNIT OF THE DAY THAT OURSELVES YOUIS IS A CIRCADIAN ONE OF TWENTY FOR HOUR CLOCK THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING POWERFUL ABOUT ENGAGING IN PARTICULAR HABITS IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE FOR TWO DAYS IN A ROW AND THEN RESETTING SO THINKING OKE I CAN DO THIS FOR A DAY NDIF I CAN DO IT FOR DAY I CAN PROBABLY DO IT FOR TWO DAYS AND THEN RESETTING SO EVERY TWO DAYS YOUR RESETTING SO YOURE CUT CHUNKING THIS TWENTY ONE DAYS INTO A SERIES OF TWO DAY BENS IN WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO PERFORM FOR TO FIVE NEW HABITS AND THEN COMPLETING THAT TWENTY ONE DAYS NOW EVERYTHING I'VE DESCRIBED ABOUT THIS TWENTY ONE DAY PROGRAM WITH SIX THINGS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AS NEW HABITS AND ONLY PERFORMING FOR TO FIVE AND NOT COMPENSATING ET CETERA THER'S NOTHING NOURO SCIENTIFICALLY UNIQUE ABABIT EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST TWENTY ONE DAYS BROKEN UP INTO TWO DAY CHUNKS AFTER TWENTY ONE DAYS YOU STOP ENGAGING IN THIS TWENTY ONE DAY DELIBERATE FOR TO FIVE THINGS PER DAY TYPESCHEDUAL AND YOU SIMPLY GO IN TO AUTO PILOT YOU ASK YOURSELF HOW MANY OF THOSE PARTICULAR HABITS THAT I WAS DELIBERATELY TRYING TO LEARN IN THE PREVIOUS TWENTY ONE DAYS ARE AUTOMATICALLY INCORPORATED INTO MY SCHEDUL HOW MANY OF THEM AM I NATURALLY DOING IN OTHER WORDS EVERY TWENTY ONE DAYS YOU DON'T UPDATE AND START ADDING NEW HABITS YOU SIMPLY TRYING MAINTAIN THE ONES THAT YOU'VE BUILT IN THAT FIRST TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THIS I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN ALL OF THE HABIT LITERATURE THAT I COULD FIND SURE THERE WAS A LOT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DATA NURRO SCIN'S DATA BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE DATA AROUND HERE'S HOW YOU FORM A HABIT HERE'S HOW YOU BREAK A HABIT THERE WAS EVEN SOME KIND OF TESTS FOR WEATHER NOT A HABIT HAD A REALLY ACHIEVED CONTEXT INDEPENDENTS WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS A STRONGLY FORMED HABIT BUT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF INFORMATION AT LEAST BY MY SEARCH OF WHAT TO DO ONCE YOU FORMED A HABIT AND HOW TO AVALUATE WHEATHER R NOT THAT HABIT IS LIKELY TO PERSIST LONG INTO THE FUTURE SO HERE'S THE IDEA YOU SET OUT THESE SIX THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN OR THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACQUIRIN YOUR LIFE THESE HABITS YOU ONLY EXPECT THAT YOU'REGOING TO PERFORM FOR OFIVE EACH DAY YOU DO THAT FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AGAIN IF YOU MISS A DAY YOU JUST HOP RIGHT BACK ON THE NEXT DAY HOWEVER YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL UNITS WITHIN THIS TWENTY WAY ONE DAY PERIOD AS TWO DAYS YOU CAN TRYING NAIL FORTIFIVE OF THESE THINGS FOR TWO DAYS IF YU HAPPEN TO GET ALL SIX GREAT BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED SOUUN NOR TWO DAYS THEN RESET TWO DAYS THEN RESET TWO DAYS AND THEN IN THE NEXT TWENTY ONE DAYS YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO ACQUIRE ANY NEW HABITSYOU'RE NOTK ENOUGH ROW IN SIX MORE HABITS THAT YOU WANT TO LEARN YOU'RE SIMPLY GOING TO ASSESS HOW WELL HOW DEEPLY YOU REWIRED YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THOSE SIX HABITS OF THE PREVIOUS TWENTY ONE DAYS THIS IS EXTREMELY USEFUL I BELIEVE BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN INDEED MAKE ROOM IF YOU EVEN HAVE ROOM I SHOULD SAY FOR MORE HABITS RIGHT MANY PEOPLE A TRY TO TRAM SO MANY NEW BEHAVIORS INTO THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THEY DON'T STAND A CHANCE OF LEARNING ALL THOSE BEHAVIORS WHAT YOU MAY FIND IS THAT YOU KEPT UP TWO OF THOSE THINGS VERY CONSYSTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY ONE DAYS AND PERHAPS THERE WAS ONE OF THEM THAT YOU DID SPERATICALLY AND THAT THERE WERE THREE OTHERS THAT FRANKLY YOU DIDN'T MANAGE TO EXECUTE YOU MAY ALSO BE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE ONE OF THESE MUTINTS THAT SETS OUT TO DO SIX NEW THINGS PERDAY FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND PERFORMS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM TERRIFIC MORE POWER TO YOU IN THAT CASE FOR THE FOLLOWING TWENTY ONE DAYS LETS SEE WHETHER NOT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO PERFORM THOSE VERY SAME SIX THINGS EVERY DAY FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THEN AND ONLY THEN WOULD YOU WANT TO ADD MORE HABITS IN SO YOU COULDE REPEAT THIS TWENTY ONE DAY PROCESS YOU KNOW TWENTY ONE DAYS OF A NEW HABIT TWENTY ONE DAYS OF TESTING THOSE NEW HABITS AS WHETHER NOT THEIRE REFLECTSOF OR NOT YOU COULD DO THAT FOR EVER IF YOU WANTED BUT THE IDEAS THAT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE DOING ALL YOAR LONG IS THAT YOU PERHAPS STARTING THE NEW YEAR OR REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS YOU SET OUT TO MAKE THAT TWENTY ONE DAY REALLY THE STIMULOUS PERIOD IN WHICH THE HABITS GET WIRED IN AND THEN THE FOLLOWING MONTH AND MAY BEVEN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS OR PERIODS OF TWENTY ONE DAYS ARE REALLY THAT COND OF THERMOMETER OF THE TEST BED OF HOW WELL YOU'VE INBEDED THOSE PARTICULAR HABITS AND IF INDEED YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO AD NEW HABITS OR YOU FIND THAT CERTAIN HABITS THAT YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO IMBED IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND MAKE REFLECTSIVE YOU WANT TO THEN BRING THOSE IN FANTASTIC BUT IT'S ONLY ONCE YOUH'VE ACHIEVED ALL THOSE SIX HABITS AS REFLECTIVE THAT YOU WOULD MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THIS SORT OF SYSTEM WILE IT COULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH MANY OTHER DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING WHOLLY ABOUT THE SYSTEM BUT THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM HAS A NUMBER OF FEATURES THE LACK OF COMPENSATION FOR MIS DAYS THE FACT THAT IT'S A FAIRLY HIGH INTENSITY PROGRAMM FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS BUT THEN YOU TEST YOURSELF A KIND OF A COMPETITION TEST WITH YOURSELF IF YOU WILL THOSE FEATURES AND THE FACT THAT HABIT SLIPS MISSING OF PARTICULAR HABITS AND NOT DOING ALL SIX IS CON  BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM I THINK MAKES IT A VERY REASONABLE ONT IT'S VERY A ADAPTABLE TO THE REAL WORLD AND I THINK IT'S ONE THAT PROVIDED YOU OBEY THE PHASE ONE FACE TWO FACE THREE TYPE SYSTEM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER YOU COLLAPSE THESE TWO PROGRAMMS A WITH ONE ANOTHER WHICH HOLLFULLY WILL BE EASY BASED ON THE DESCRIPTIONS I'VE GIVEN WELL IF YOU DO THAT I THINK I'S A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THE HABITS THAT YU TRY INFORM WILL ACHIEVE THIS CONTEXTS DEPENDENTS AND THAT IT WILL TAKE PROGRESSIVELY LESS AND LESS LEMBIC FRICTION TO PERFORM THEM THUS FAR WE'VE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BEEN DISCUSSING HOW TO FORM HABITS BUT WHAT ABOUT BREAKING HABITS CERTAINLY MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WOULD LIKE TO BREAK HABITS THAT THEY FEEL DON SERVE THEM WELL ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND BREAKING HABITS IS THAT MANY HABITS OCCUR VERY VERY QUICKLY AND SO THERE ISN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE UNTIL THE HABIT HAS ALREADY BEEN INITIATED AND IN SOME CASES COMPLETED WELL THERE ARE COUPLE OF TOOLS THAT NURO SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY TELL US CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE SOMEWHAT INTUITIVE AND RELATE TO WHAT I CALL FOUNDATIONAL PRACTICES MEANING THINGS THAT SET THE OVER ALL TONE IN YOUR BODY AND BRAIN SUCH THAT YOU WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN A PARTICULAR HABIT OR THAT WOULD RAISE YOUR LEVEL OF AWARENESS BOTH OF YOUR SITUATION AND TO HOW YOU FEEL INSIDE SO THINGS LIKE STRESS REDUCTION THINGS LIKE GETTING GOOD SLEEP THINGS LIKE QUOLITY NUTRITION THINGS LIKE HAVING POSITIVE ROUTINES ARRANGE THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY ALL OF THOSE OF COURSE WILL SUPPORT YOU IN TRYING TO BREAK PARTICULAR HABITS AND WHILE THAT CAN BE VERY USEFUL ITS ADMITTEDLY VERY GENERIC ADVICE IT DOESN'T POINT TO ANY ONE SPECIFIC PROTOCAL IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC PROTOCALL THAT ONE COULD APPLY IN ORDER TO BREAK HABITS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE SORT OF NEURO PLASTICITY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WE TALKED ABOUT A FORM OF NEURO PLASTICITY CALL LONG TERM POTENTIATION INVOLVING THE N M D A RECEPTOR JUST TO REFRESS YOUR MEMORY ALOBIT ITBASICALLY SAYS THAT IF A SET OF NURONS IS VERY ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE IT'S LIKELY THAT OVER TIME THOSE NURONS WILL COMMUNICATE WITH THEMSELVES MORE EASILY BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THINGS LIKE ENEMDY A RECEPTOR ACTIVITY THE RECRUITMENT OF ADDITIONAL RECEPTORS ET CETERA IT'S ESSENTIALLY A CELLER AND MOLECULAR EXPLANATION FOR HOW SOMETHING GOES FROM UNLEARNED TO LEARN TO REFLECIVE NOW IN ORDER TO BREAK SINAPSES OR TO BREAK A PART NEURAL CONNECTIONS THAT ARE SERVING A HABIT THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO ENGAGE IN WE NEED TO ENGAGE THE PROCESS CALLED LONG TERM DEPRESSION AND LONG TRM DEPRESSION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A STATE OF MENTAL DEPRESSION OR A REDUCTION IN MOOD SO I REALLY WANT TO BE CLEAR HN WHEN I SAY DEPRESSION IN THIS CONTEXT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRESSION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MOOD IT'S SIMPLY CALL LONG TERM DEPRESSION BECAUSE JUST AS LONG TERM POTENIATION SAYS IF NURON A TRIGGERS THE FIRING OF NURON B AND IT DOES SO VERY REBOSLY OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE NURON A WILL NOT HAVE TO FIRE AS INTENSELY OR AS FREQUENTLY IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE NURON B IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THEY BECOME POTENTIATED RIGHT THE THRESHOLD FOR COACTIVATION HAS BEEN REDUCED THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT THEY WILL BE ACTIVATED TOGEBTHER AT LOW LEVELS OF INTENSITY THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT LONG TERM PATENTIATION IS LONG TERM DEPRESSION SAYS THAT IF NURON A IS ACTIVE AND NURON B IS NOT ACTIVE WITHIN A PARTICULAR TIME WINDOW THEN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN NURON A AND B WILL WEAKEN OVER TIME EVEN IF THEY STARTED OFF VERY STRONGLY CONNECTED OCANSOMEON O REPEAT THAT THE CASUS IS A PRETTY A DETAILED NUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISM WHEREBY IF NURON A IS ACTIVE AND NURON B IS ACTIVE BUT AT A DIFFERENT TIME OR OUTSIDE OF PARTICULAR WHAT WE CALL TEMPORAL WINDOW MEANING OUTSIDE A PARTICULAR TIME WINDOW THEN THROUGH LONG TERM DEPRESSION THE CONNECTION BETWEEN NURON A AND NURON B WILL WEAKEN AND JUST AS A POINT OF INTEREST THE N M D A RECEPTOR IS ALSO INVOLVED IN LONG TERM DEPRESSION ALTHOUGH THEIR OTHER MOLECULAR COMPONENTS INVOLVED IS WELL SO HOW DO YOU TAKE TWO NURONS THAT UNDERLIE A HABIT OUT OF SYNCRANY HOW DO YOU GET THEM TO FIRE A SINCERNISLY THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING WITH RESPECT TO THE CELLAR MOLICULAR BOLOGY BUT AT THE BEHAVIORAL LEVEL IT'S ESPECIALLY INTERESTING THE WAY THAT ONE WOULD DO THIS IS LET SAY FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE A HABIT OF PICKING UP YOUR PHONE MID WORK SESSION CE THAT'S A REFLECTSIVE HABIT I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED AND WE OFTEN HERE THE IDEA THAT OE YOU KNOW THE PHONE IS SO FILLED WITH ACCESS TO DOPOMINE AND INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT WERE JUST DRAWN TO IT BUT IF YOU NOTICE WHAT'S HAPPEN WITH PHONE YU SOVER TIME MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF SOMETIMES I ADMIT FIND OURSELVES JUST LOOKING AT OUR PHONE OR FIND OURSELVES IN A PARTICULAR AP WITHOUT ACTIALLY HAVING ENGAGED IN THE CONSCIOUS SET OF STEPS OF OH I'M REALLY CURIOUS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PARTICULAR AP I'M REALLY CURIOUS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PARTICULAR WEBSIGHT AND YOU JUST KIND OF FIND YOURSELF IN EIR QUOTES AFTER THOSE OF YOU LISTENING ON MAKING AIRQUOTES YOU JOS SORT OF FIND YOURSELF DOING IT BECAUSE OF THE BEHAVIOR OF PICKING UP YOUR PHONE AS SORT OF REFLECIVE OR AS BECOME FULLY REFLECTS OF YOU SEE THIS A LOT AT MEALS WHERE MULTIMLE PEOPLE ARE THERE AND NO ONES LOOKING AT THEIR PHONA TAND ALSO AND SO ONE TAKES OUT THEIR HONAN YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OTHER PEOPLE JUST NATURALLY TAKE OUT THEIR PHONESS THIS KIND OF AM OBSERVED A OBSERVATION INDUCED REFLECT AND I WOULD WAGER THAT MOST PEOPLE AREN'T CONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF THE INIMMEDIATE STEPS INVOLVED SO THE LITERATURE SAYS THEIR NUMBER WAYS TO BREAK THESE SORTS OF HABITUAL BEHAVIORS OR REFLECTSIVE BEHAVIORS MOST OF THOSE APPROACHES INVOLVE ESTABLISHING SOME SORT OF REWARD FOR NOT PERFORMING THE ACTIVITY OR SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT FOR FORMING THE ACTIVITY I'VE HEARD OF ON SOME BASIC THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO LIKE THEY LEVEN PUT LIKE A RUBBER BAND ON THEIR WRIST AND EVERY TIME THEY COMPLAIN OR EM EVERY TIME THEY DO SOME BEHAVIOR LIKE PICK UP THEIR PHONE THEY'LL IVE THEMSELVES A SNAP ON THE WRIST THE AT THEIR ACTIONAL THERE IS THAT YOUR TRYING TO CREATE SOMATIC A VERY PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF SOMETHING THAT MAKES IT VERY REAL AND HARDER TO OVERLOOK OTHER PEOPLE JUST TO A TICMARK ON A PIECE OF PAPER THE SORT OF UM WHAT GETS MEASURED IS WHAT GETS M MANAGED KIND OF MIND SET WHERE IF EVERY TIME YOU DO SOMETHING YOU TAKE AWAY THE JUDGEMENT THIS IS VERY NEW AG I REALIZE BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU FIND OUT THERE IF YOU ASEARCH THE LITERATURE AND EVEN ON PUBMED A PUR REVIEWED ARTICLES THAT EVERY TIME YOU ENGAGE IN A BEHAVIOR YOU JUST MEASURE THE FACT YOU THAT YOU A DID THAT BEHAVIOR YOU JUST MARK IT DOWN AT THE END OF THE D EY PEOPLE ARE SUPOSE TO LOOK O THAT SI O MY GOODNESS I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I SPENT A YOU KNOW THREE HOURS DOING SOMETHING ORE I DED IT FORTY SIX TIMES IN FACT A LOT OF AP SOCIAL MEDIA APS WE'LL START TO GIVE YOU WARNINGS NOW IF YOU OPPED IN THAT YOU'VE BEEN ON THE AP FOR AN HOUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE MOST PEOPLE TUST CLICKRIGHT PAST AND GO BACK IN I THINK VERY FEW PEOPLE A SAY OH MYGONESS HAT SPEN AN HOUR AND THEREFORE YOU RIGHT I ABSOLUTION ENGAGE IN THIS ANY MORE I'S JUST FAR TOO EASY TO JUST BLOW PAST THOSE REMINDERS WELL THE LITERATURE ON HABIT FORMATION AND HABIT REDUCTION BREAKING HABITS HAS BEEN ANALYZERS A BEAUTIFUL A META ANALYSIS WHICH INVOLVES LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STUDIES ALTOGETHER AH COMPARING THE STATISTICAL STRENGTH OF EACH OF THOSE STUDIES LOOKING INDIFFERENT CONDITIONS WHAT SORTS OF HABITS WERE TRYING TO BE MADE OR BROKEN A THE FIRST AUTHOR ON THIS REVIEW IS FRITZ IF ARE ITESY AM I'LL CERTAINLY PUT A LINK TO THIS A IT'S HEATHER FRITZ AND IT'S A INTERVENTION TO MODIFY HABITS A SCOPING REVIEW AND IT IS INDEED A VERY BROADSCALE REVIEW ITS FROM THE JOURNAL OCCUPATION FOR DISSIPATION AND HEALTH S PUBLISH IN TWENTY TWENTY SA REALLY NICE ARTICLE COUPLE OF THINGS I LEARN FROM THIS ARTICLE AND THOT I'LL GET INTO THE SPECIFIC TOOL FOR BREAKING HABITS PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING THING THAT I TOOK FROM THIS REVIEW WHATS THE FINDING THAT NOTIFICATIONS TO EITHER ENGAGE IN HABITS OR TO NOT ENGAGE IN HABITS ACTUALLY WERE NOT VERY EFFECTIVE OVER TIME THEY WERE EFFECTIVE IN THE IN IMMEDIATE PERIOD WHEN PEOPLE STARTED USING THESE NOTIFICATIONS AS WERE LITTLE STICKY NOTES LIKE DON'T GO INTO THE REFERGERATOR BETWEEN THE HOURS OF WHATEVER AND WHATEVER OR A JUST VISUAL REMINDERS PHYSICAL REMINDERS ORE ELECTRONIC REMINDERS WERE EFFECTIVE IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM BUT IN THE LONG TERM DID NOT PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WOULD EFFECTIVELY STICK TO HABITS THEY WERE TRYING TO STICK TO OR BREAK HABITS THAT THEY WERE TRING TO BREAK SO SADLY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK VERY WELL A AND PERHABS THEY JUST NEED TO COME UP WITH AM MORE ROBUST REMINDERS HOUT IN A MILD ELECTRIC SHOCK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE DO KNOW ONLY SORT OF KETTING ABOUT MY ELECTRIC SHOCK BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM BOTH HUMAN IN ANIMAL STUDIES IS THAT THINGS LIKE ELECTRIC SHOCK THINGS LIKE MONITARY PENALTIES RIGHT HAVING TO PAY HOUT EVERY TIME YOU ENGAGE IN A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR THOSE ARE PRETTY EFFECTIVE WAYS TO BREAK HABITS THE PROBLEM IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING MONITERD FOR HABIT USE AM FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN IMAGINE A SITUATION WEARE YOU SAY I'M NOT IN TO PICK UP MY PHONE FOR THE FOUR HOURS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY SO THAT I CAN GET IN A REAL DEDICATED FOCUS WORK DONE A UNLESS SOME ONE'S MONITERING THEM THEN PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO MONITOR THEMSELVES COMPLETELY ENOUGH THAT THEY PUNISH THEMSELVES COMPLETELY ENOUGH THAT THEY BREAK THE BEHAVIOUR INOTHER WORDS THAT THE PUNISHMENT ISN'T BAD ENOUGH IN ORDER TO BREAK THE HABIT WHICH JUST SPEAKS TO HOW POWERFUL THESE HABITS ARE ONCE THEY BECOME REFLECTSIVE THEY'RE JUST VERY VERY HARD TO OVERRIDE SO TURNS OUT THAT THE KEY TO GENERATING LONG TERM DEPRESSION IN THESE PATHWAYS IS ACTUALLY TO TAKE THE PERIOD MEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE BAD HABIT EXECUTION MEANING LET'S SAY YOU TELL YORSELF YOU'RE NOT IN TO PICK UP YOUR PHONE YOUNRD I CAN BITE YOUR NAILS YOU'RE NOT IN REFLECTIVELY WALK TO THE REFRGERATOR A PATICULAR TIME OF DAY BUT YOU FIND YOURSELF DOING IT ANYWAY AND WHAT ACTUALLY HAS TO HABIN IS BRINGING CONSCIOUS AWARENESS TO THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD WHICH I THINK MOST PEOPLE RECOGNIZED THA REAL ISE AH I JUST DID IT AGAIN I JUST DID I AGAIN AND IN THAT MOMENT CACTURE THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS NOT THAT LED TO THE BAD HABIT EXECUTION BUT ACTUALLY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THE NURONS THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING THAT BAD HABIT WERE WERE ACTIVE A MOMENT TO GO AND TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN A REPLACEMENT BEHAVIOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD NOW THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING AND I THINK POWERFUL BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT YOU HAFTER ENGAGE IN A REPLACEMENT BEHAVIOR THAT TRULY REPLACES THE BAD HABIT BEHAVIOR RIGHT AH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOUR STATE OF MIND OR THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS LEADING INTO THE BAD HABIT BUT RATHER THE STAGE OR THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BAD HABIT EXECUTION IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO IN SERT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL A DAPTIVE BEHAVIOR BUT THAT COULD BE ANY BEHAVIOR THAT'S NOT INLINE WITH THE BAD BEHAVIOR SO LET'S GIVE AN N EXAMPLE LET' SAY YOU FIND YOURSELF AM YOU'RE TRYING TO DO FOCUSSTD WORK YOU PICK UP YOUR PHONE YOU'RE DISAPPOINTING YOURSELF FOR FOR PICKING UP YOUR PHONE YOU COULD OF COURSE JUST PUT IT DOWN OR YOU AND RE ENGAGE THE WORK BEHAVIOR BUT IF YOU WERE GOOD AT THAT THAN YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IS TO GO ENGAGE IN SOME OTHER POSITIVE HABIT NOW THIS HAS TOO MAJOUR EFFECTS THE FIRST ONE IS YOU START TO LINK IN TIME THE EXECUTION OF A BAD BEHAVIOR TO THIS OTHER GOOD BEHAVIOR AND IN DOING SO YOU START TO RECRUIT OTHER NURL CIRCUITS OTHER NURONS THAT CAN START TO SOMEWHAT DISMANTLE THE SEQUENCE OF FIRING ASSOCIATED WITH THE BAD BEHAVIOR IN OTHER WORDS YOU START TO CREATE A KIND OF A DOUBLE HABIT THAT STARTS WITH A BAD HABIT AND THAN ENDS WITH A GOOD HABIT AND THAT SEEMS TO CREATE A ENOUGH OF A TEMPORAL MISMATCH SO THAT THEN RECOGNIZING WHEN YOU'RE HEADING TOWARD THE BAD HABIT BECOMES MORE APPARENT TO YOU SO AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE THIS VERY VERY CONCRETE LET'S SAY THAT THE ONBEHAVIOR IS A REFLECTIVELY PICKING UP ONE'S PHONE YOU DO THAT YOU THINK A GOODNESS I DID IT AGAIN HERE'S WHAT I' MAN TO DO YOU WOULD SET THAT DOWN AND THEN YOU ENGAGE IN SOME OTHER POSITIVE BEHAVIOR THAT YOU'VE DEEMED POSITIVE AND HERE IT'S VERY SUBJECTIVE SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE THAT WILL NECESSARILY MAKE SENSE TO EVERYBODY BUT PERHAPS AM YOURE WORKING ON HYDRATION SO MAY BOU GI HAVE A GLASS OF WATER MAYBE YOU AM YOU ARE TRYING TO A DO BREATHWORK OR SOMETHING MAYBE HER YOU ARE TRYING TO AENHANCE YOUR LANGUAGE SPEAKING SKILLS AND SO YOU GO IN YOU SPEND FIVE MINUTES DOING A PARTICULAR TYPE OF LANGUAGE LEARNING YOU LITERALLY EXIT WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING AND PERFORM THAT OTHER NEW POSITIVE HABIT IN THE IMMEDIATE PERIOD RIGHT AFTER THAT EVEN FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT'S A LITTLE BIT COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT WHAT THIS DOES AS IT CREATES THE KIND OF A COGNITIVE AND A TEMPORAL MISMATCH BETWEEN THE INITIAL BAD BEHAVIOR WHICH BEFORE IS WHAT WE  CALL SORT OF A CLOSED LOOP IN THE ENGINEERS OUT THERE WILL KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT BUT IN CLOTHES LOOP IS O ONE BEHAVIOUR ONE SET OF NARL FIRINGS LEADS TO ANOTHER LEADS TO ANOTHER AND THEN JUST KIND OF SETS THE SAME THING IN MOTION IT CAN BE KIND OF A SELF PERPETUATING SYSTEM BY CHANGING THE NUMBER OF FEATURES THAT ARE IN THAT LOOP IT DISRRUPTS THE THE CLOSED NATURE OF THAT LOOP IT CREATES WHAT WE CALL AN OPEN LOOP AND IN AN OPEN LOOP YOU ARE BETTER ABLE TO INTERVENE SO AS I MENTION BEFORE THIS MIGHT SEEM COUNTER INTUITIVE MI THINK WHY WOATD I WANT TO REWARD THE EXECUTION OF IT BAD HABIT WITH A GOOD HABIT I DON'T WANT O REWARD MYSELF FOR THE BAD HABIT BUT REALLY WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IS YOUR TRYING TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE NURL CIRCUITS THAT ARE FIRING SO THAT YOU CAN REWRITE THE SCRIPT FOR THAT BAD HABIT A DIFFERENT WAY TO PUT IT WOULD BE IMAGINE THAT THE BAD HABIT IS LIKE A US A CORD ON THE PIANO THAT YOU PLAY OR A CORD OF NOTES ARE A SEQUENCE OF NOTES THAT YOU WOULD PLAY AND IT COMES VERY EASILY YOU CAN PLAY AT EVERY SINGLE TIME BUT LETS SAY AS YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN A NEW PIECE OF MUSIC YOU JUST CONSTANTLY INCERTING THAT AT THE INAPPROPRIATE TIMES THAT WAS YOU KNOW  THINGS THO DECENT ENOUGH ANALOGY FOR A BAD HABIT BECAUSE IT INVOLVES SOME MOTOR EXECUTION YOU JUST FIND YOURSELF DOING IT RATHER THAN TRYING TO PREVENT YOURSELF FROM DOING IT THE NEXT TIME YOU DO IT AD IN A NEW CORDOR SEQUENCE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN WHAT THIS DOES THEN IS IT CHANGES THE WHOLE NATURE OF THE SEQUENCE OF NURONS THAT ARE FIRING FROM BAD HABIT THROUGH TO THE END OF THIS NEWLY APPLIED GOOD HABIT SO THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU START TO DISMANTLE OR WHEN I SAY DIS MANTL REALLY WEAKEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IF NURON A FIRES NURON B WILL FIRE BECAUSE AS YOURE STARTING OFF IN THE MODE OF VERY REFLECTIVELY PERFORMING A BAD HABIT THOSE NURNS ARE FIRING TOGETHER WITHOUT YOU CONSCIOUSLY BEING AWARE OF IT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO INTERVENE IN YOURSELF A WITHOUT  NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES LIKE SEVERE PUNISHMENT A SEVERE CONSEQUENCE TI OUTCOMES RATHER TACKING ON SOME ADDITIONAL SEQUENCES LIKE IF NURON A FIRES NUR ON B FIRES AND THEN YOU'RE SAYING O K WHILE IF NR ON B FIRES I'M GET A STARTINCERTING NUR ON C D E F TO FIRE RIGHT THAT'S THE C D  F BEING THE POSITIVE BEHAVIOUR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO INSERT AND IN DOING SO YOU CREATE A CHAIN OF NURNAL ACTIVATION THAT THEN IS VERY EASY TO THIS MANTLE AND SO WHEN PEOPLE HAVE APPLIED THIS TIND OF APPROACH IT REMOVES THE NEED TO HAVE CONSTANT CONSCIOUS AWARENESS OF ONE'S OWN BEHAVIOUR PRIOR TO THAT BEHAVIOR WHICH IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE RATHER WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN REMAPPING OF THE NURAL CIRCUITS ASSOCIATE WITH BAD HABITS IN WAYS THAT ARE VERY VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS IDENTIFY WHEN YOU'VE DONE THE THING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO AND THEN TACK ON TO THAT SOMETHING ADDIT TIONAL THAT'S POSITIVE NOW THE NATURE OF THAT POSITIVE THING IS IMPORTANT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HARD TO EXECUTE YOU WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S POSITIVE AND FAIRLY EASY TO EXECUTE SO THAT YOU'RE NOT STRUGGLING ALL THE TIME TO INCERT THIS ON TOP OF THIS BAD BEHAVIOR WHATEVER THAT BAD BEHAVIOR MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE BUT AGAIN THIS IS ROOTED IN TE BIOLOGY OF LONGTERM DEPRESSION IT MAPS VERY WELL TO THE BEHAVIORAL CHANGE TO LITERATURE THAT I WAS ABLE TO GLEAN THAT REALLY SHOWS THAT RATHER THAN JUST GET REMINDERS RATHER THAN TRYING AND STILL PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN SETTING UP REWARD FOR BREAKING BAD HABITS THAT PERHAPS THE SIMPLEST WAY TO APPROACH THIS IS TO TACK ON ADDITIONAL BEHAVIORS TO THE BAD HABITS MAKE SURE THOSE BEHAVIORS ARE GOOD BEHAVIORS OR BEHAVIORS THAT ARE ADAPTIVE FOR YOU AND IN DOING SO YOU WILL SOON FIND THAT THE INITIATION OF THE BAD HABIT TAKES ON A WHOLE NEW FORM OR THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN INSPIRED TO DO IT AT ALL AND OF COURSE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BREAKING BAD HABITS IS REALLY HARD WE HAD AN EPISODE ALL ABOUT ADDICTION WITH DOCTOR ON ALIMPKI FROM STAMFORD MEDICAL SCHOOL IS A CHOLLEAGUE OF MIND WHO RUNS THE DUAL DIAGNOSIS A DICTION CLINIC AT STAMFORD AND IN THAT EPISODE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW ATDICS FOR DRUGS ALKOHOL PEOPLE HAVE ADICTIONS TO CERTAIN TYPES OF BEHAVIORS OR AVOIDANCE BEHAVIORS EVEN THAT IN THE CASE OF ADDICTION THERE HAS TO BE A TREMENDOUS KIND OF FULL SCALE A CAMPAIGN FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE IN THEIR BEHAVIOR SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THERE ARE THINKING ABOUT BAD HABIT BREAKING IN THE CONTEXT OF ADDICTIVE TYPE BEHAVIORS DEFINITELY CHECK OUT THAT EPISODE A DICTION DOES EMPLOY SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES AROUND HABIT MAKING AND HABIT BREAKING AS IT WERE A BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE THE A CONSEQUENCES OF CERTAIN HABITS IN ADDICTION CAN BE SO SEVERER THERE'S OTHER SETS OF PROTOCALS AND THERE'S A KIND OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL BAK TROP TO IT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IT ALSO RELATES TO THE BIOLOGY OF DOPEMEANING YOU CAN FIND ALL OF THAT IN THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR ON OLEMPKY SO TO DAY WE'VE COVERED A LOT ABOUT THE BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY OF HABIT FORMATION AND HABIT BREAKING WE TALKED ABOUT WY CERTAIN HABITS ARE SO HARD TO WIRE IN WISERN HABITS ARE SO HARD TO BREAK DOWN AND ELIMINATE AND HOW WE CAN DETERMINE WHICH HABITS ARE GOING TO BE EASIER FOR US TO ACCESS WHICH HABITS ARE GOING TO BE HARDER FOR US TO ACCESS AND BREAK WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS NOTION OF LIMBIC FRICTION AND WE TALKED ABOUT CONTEXT DEPENDENTS AND WE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS AS IT RELATES TO NURRAL CIRCUITS AND THE FORMATION OF NEW CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN AND STRENGTHENING AND WE CANING OF CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN WE ALSO DISCUSSD TWO PROGRAMMS PROGRAMS DESIGN SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU ON THE BASIS OF THE NERBILOGY LITERATURE AND THE LITERATURE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HABIT FORMATION AND HABIT BREAKING JUST A BRIEFLY RECAP ONE PROGRAMME INVOLVES DIVIDING THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY INTO THREE PHASES FASE ONE FACE TWO FACE THREE AND TO TRYIND TACKLE SPECIFIC HABITS AT PARTICULAR PHASES OF THE TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE THE SECOND PROGRAMME INVOLVED A TWENTY ONE DAY PROCESS OF ENGAGING A PROXIMATELY SIX NEW HABITS PER DAY ALTHOUGH THE EXPECTATION AS I MENTION EARLIER IS THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PERFORM ALL SIX OF THOSE AND AN ASSESSMENT IN THE FOLLOWING TWENTY ONE DAYS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE INDEED FORMED THOSE NEW HABITS OR NOT AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES THAT I MENTION THAT WERE RELATED TO THOSE TWO GENERAL PROGRAMS FACE ONE FACE TO FACE THREE AND THE TWENTY ONE DAY PROGRAM AN HOW THOSE COL BE MESHED TOGETHER SO I'M GUESSING SOME OF YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS AND HOW TO APPLY THEM BUT HOPEFULLY THEY WERE CLEAR ENOUGH FOR YOU TO GET STARTED THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MENTION THAT HE HOUBERMEN LADPODCAST AS SOMETHING CALLED THE NURRL NETWORK NEWS LETTER THAT IS SENT OUT APPROXIMATELY ONCE A MONTH FOR THE NEXT NEWS LETTER I WERE RELEASE A ON PAPER VERSION OF THESE TWO SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY MESH TOGETHER FOR HABIT FORMATION AND HABIT BREAKING AND IF YOU LIKE TO ACTS US THAT YOU CAN GO TO HUBERMAN LABDOT CAM YOU GO TO THE MENU YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR THE NEWS LETTER FIRST OF ALL ITS ZERO COST SECOND OF ALL WE HAVE OUR PRIVACY POLICY THERE BUT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WE DON'T SHARE YOUR EMAL WITH ANY VENDORS OR ANY OTHER A SOURCES THOSE EMAL STATE AM INTERNAL TO US AND IF YOU LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE SORT OF FLAVOR OF THOSE NEWS LETTERS IS THE PREVIOUS NEWS LETTERS FOR INSTANCE ONE ON TOOLS FOR SLEEP THAT I MENTION EARLIER OR ON TOOLS FROR NEURO PLASTICITY IN THE CLASS FROM AND OUTSIDE THE CLASS FROM AS WELL FOR TEACHERS AND FOR STUDENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS THOSE ARE ALSOPPOSETED THERE SO YOU CAN ACCESS ANY OF THE PREVIOUS NEWS LETTERS I HOPE IS THAT TO DAY YOU'VE LEARNED BOTH THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND THE PRACTICAL TOOLS BY WHICH YOU CAN START TO ESTABLISH HABITS THAT FOR YOU YOU DEEM ADAPTEV HEALTHY AND THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU IN YOUR GOALS AND THET YOU CAN START TO DISMANTAL SOME OF THE HABITS THAT YOU FIND TO BE UNHEALTHY OR MALADAPTIVE FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR GOALS IF YOU'RE LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR OUTO CHANNEL THAT'S A TERRIFIC WAY TO SUPPORT UST IN ADDITION ON YOU TO YOU CAN LEAVE US FEED BACK IN THE COMMENT

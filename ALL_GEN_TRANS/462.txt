WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN O SCIENCE SCIENCE TACE TO E I AM INJUR HUBERMAN AND ON UR PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR CHARLES ZUKER DOCTOR ZUCKER IS A PROFESSOR BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOL PHYSICS AND OF NEURO SCIENCE A COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DOCTOR ZUCKER IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERTS IN PERCEPTION THAT IS HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CONVERTS PHYSICAL STIMULE IN THE WORLD INTO A VENTS WITHIN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WE COME TO UNDERSTAND AS OUR SENSE OF SMELL OUR SENSE OF TASTE OUR SENSE OF VISION OUR SENSE OF TOUCH AND OUR SENSE OF HURING DOCTOR ZUCKER'S LAB IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PIONEERING AND GROUND BREAKING WORK IN THE AREA OF PERCEPTION FOR A LONG TIME HIS LABORATORY WORKED ON VISION DEFINING THE VERY RECEPTERS THAT ALLOW FOR THE CONVERSION OF LIGHT INTO SIGNALS THAT THE REST OF THE EYE IN THE BRAIN CAN UNDERSTAND IN RECENT YEARS HIS LABORATORY IS FOCUSED MAINLY ON THE PERCEPTION OF TASTE AND INDEED HIS LABORATORY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISCOVERING MANY OF THE TASTE RECEPTORS LEADING TO OUR PERCEPTION OF THINGS LIKE SWEETNESS SOURNESS BITTERNESS SALTINESS AND UMAMI THAT IS SAVORINESS IN FOOD DOCTOR ZUCKER'S LABORATORY IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING GROUND BREAKING WORK ON THE SENSE OF THIRST THAT IS HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM DETERMINES WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD INJEST MORE FLUID OR REJECT FLUIDS THAT ARE OFFERED TO US DA KEY FEATURE OF THE WORK FROM DOCTOR ZOKER'S LABORATORY IS THAT IT BRIDGES THE BRAIN AND BODY AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN FROM TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS LABORATORY HAS DISCOVERED A UNIQUE SET OF SUGAR SENSING NURONS THAT EXIST NOT JUST WITHIN THE BRAIN BUT A SEPARATE SET OF NURONS THAT SENT SWEETNESS AND SUGAR WITHIN THE BODY AND THAT MUCH OF THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND BODY LEADING TO OUR SEEKING OF SUGAR IS BELOW OUR CONSCIOUS DETECTION DOCTOR ZUCKER HAS RECEIVED A LARGE NUMBER OF PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS AND APPOINTMENTS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS DISCOVERIES IN NEROE SCIENCE HE IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE IS ALSO AN INVESTIGATOR WITH THE HOWARD HUGH'S MEDICAL INSTITUTE FOR THOSE OF YOUTHEN ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SO CALLED H H M I  HOWRD UG'S MEDICAL INSTITUTE HOWD U'S MEDICAL INSTITUTE INVESTIGATORS ARE SELECTED ON AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE BASIS AND INDEED THEY HAVE TO COMBACK EVERY FIVE YEARS AND PROVE THEMSELVES WORTHY OF BEING REAPPOINTED AS HOWARD HUGH'S INVESTIGATORS DOCTOR ZUCKER HAS BEEN AT HOWARD HUGH'S INVESTIGATOR SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WHAT ALL THAT MEANS FOR YOU AS A VIEWER AND OR LISTENER OF TO DAY'S PODCAST IS THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO LEARN ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ITS ABILITY TO CREATE PERCEPTIONS IN PARTICULAR THE PERCEPTION OF TASTE AND SUGAR SENSING FROM THE WORLD'S EXPERT ON PERCEPTION AND TASTE DAB CERTAIN THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S PODCAST YOU ARE NOT JUST GOING TO COME AWAY WITH A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERCEPTIONS AND OUR PERCEPTION OF TASTE AND PARTICULAR BUT INDEED YOU WILL COME AWAY WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE CREATE INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD AROUND UST AND IN DOING SO HOW WE COME TO UNDERSTAND AR LIFE EXPERIENCE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IN RESEART ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SINE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR CHARLES ZOOKER CHARLES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOIND ME TODAY LITER I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT MANY THINGS RELATED TO TASTE OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AN THEREASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGH HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOT MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WIH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICION IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDIVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLIYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM IND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DO COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEI'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTY THAT CALM SLASH HUMORMAN AND GUSTATORY PERCEPTION BUT IN TO START OFF AND BECAUSE YOU'VE WORKED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TOPICS ANNERAL SCIENCE NOT JOUS TASTE HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT PERCEPTION OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY HOW SHOULD THE WORLD AND PEOPLE THINK ABOUT PERCEPTION HOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM SENSATION AND WHAT LEADS TO OUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE IN TERMS OF VISION HERING TASTES ET CETERA SO IN THE BRAIN IS AND EXTRAORDINARY ORGAN THAT WAITS MAYB TO PERSENT OF YOUR BODY MASS YET IT CONSUMES ANY WERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL OR FURE ENERGY AN OXYGEN AND IT GETS TRANSFORM INTO A MIND AND THIS MIN CHANGES TE HUMAN CONDITION T MAKE  CHANGESY TRANSFORMS IN A FEAR INTO COURAGE CONFORMITY INTO REATIVITY SADNESS INTO HAPPINESS HOW HOW HOW THE HELL DOES THAT HAPPEN NOW THE CHALLENGE THAT THE BRAIN FACES IS THAT THE WORLD IS MADE OF REAL THINGS IN O THIS HERE IS A GLASS AND THIS IS A CORD AND THIS IS A MICROPHON BUT THE BRAIN IS ONLY MADE OF NURANS THAT ONLY UNDERSAND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS SO HOW DID YOU TRANSFORM THAT REALITY INTO NOTHING THAT ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT NOW NEED TO REPRESENT THE WORLD AND THAT PROCESS IS WECAN IS WHAT WE CAN OPERATIONALLY DEFINE AS PERCEPTION IN THE SENSES THIT SAY O FACTORY OTHEROR TASTE VISION NOT WE CAN VERY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY SEPARATE DETECTION FROM PERCEPTION DETECTION IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE A SUGAR MOLECULE YOU PUT IT IN YOUR TNGU AND IN A SET OF SPECIFIC CELLS NOW SENSE THAT SUGAR MOLECULE THAT'S DETECTION YOU HAVEN'T PERCEIVE ANYTHING YET THAT IS YES YOURSELVES IN YOUR TONGUE INTERRACTING WITH THIS CHEMICAL BUT NOW THAT SO GETS APTIVATED AND SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN AND NOW DETECTION GETS TRANSFORM INTO PERCEPTION AND IS TRAIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HAPPENS THAT'S BEIN TH THE MANAYACOD DRIVE OF MY ENTIRE CAREERING NEURAL SCIENCE HOW THA'S THE BRAIN ULTIMATELY TRANSFORM DETECTION INTO PERCEPT ION SO THAT IT CAN GUIDE ACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS THE I MAKSENS ABSOLUTELY AND IS A VERY CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION A SORT OF HIGHLEVE QUESTION RELATED TO THAT AND THEN I THINK WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THE INTERMEDIATE STEPS N THING MANY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER R NOT MY PERCEPTION OF THE COLOR OF YOUR SHIRT IS THE SAME AS YOUR PERCEPTIOET ANILINCRESTION AM I LOOKANE TO INTERRUPT YOU AS YOUR AS I'M GUESSING WHAT YOUARE GOING OR MY YOUR INTERRUPTION IS WELON A ATCAST ATHE AUDIENCE WILL ALWAYS PENALIZE ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU AND WELL NEVER PENALIZE YOU FOR INTOR I LIKE THE ONE WAY PINALIZE NOW EVEN WHAT I TOLD YOU BEFORE THAT THE BRAIN IS TRYING TO REPRESENT THE WORLD PASE IN NOTHING BUT THE TRANSFORMATION OF THESE SIGNALS INTO E LECTRY CO YOU KNOW LANGUAGES THAT THOW NURONS HAVE TO ENCOT AND THE COD IT FOLLOWS THAT YOUR BRAIN IS DIFFERENT TAT MY BRAIN AND BEFORE IT FELLOWS THAT THE WAY THAT YOUR PRECEIVING THE WORL MUST BE DIFFERENT THAN MINE EVEN WHEN PECEIVING THE SAME CENSORY CUSE I ND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT AN EXPERIMENT IS A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT IT BRILLIANT THE DEMONSTRATES WHY WE PERCEIVE THE WOR HOW WE PERCEIVE THE WORLD DIFFERENT SO IN THE WORL OF VISION AS YOU KNOW WELL WELL NOW WE HAVE THREE CLASSES OF FOTE RECEPTORINE ROOMS THAT SENDS THREE BASY COLORS IT RED BLUE AND GREEN IT O BLUE GREEN AND RED IF WE GO YOU KNOW FROM SURE TO LONG WAVELING AND THES THREE ARE SUFFICIENT TO ACCOMMODATE THE FOL VECIBLE SPECTRA AN WHEN I TAKE THREE LIGHT PROJECTORS AND I'M WHEN I PROJECTED ON INTO A WHITE SCREAM IT RED LIGHT AND THE OTHY ONE GREEN LIGHT AND WHEN I OVERLAVE THE TWO BEAMS AND ON THE SCREEN TO TO BE YELLOW O GIT IS THI SUPERPOSITION WHEN YOU HAVE TWO BEAMS OF OF RED AND GREEN AND THEN I'M WHEN I TAKE A THIRD PROJECTOR AND I'M WHEN I TOO THAT FOLTER THAT PROJECTS RIGHT NEXT TO THAT NEXT BEAM A SPECTRALLY PURE YELLOW AND I'M WHEN I ASK YOU TO COME TO THE RED AND GREEN PROJECTORS AND PHLEE WITH INTENSITY NOVS SO THAT YOU CAN MATCH THAT YELLOW THAT YOUR PROJECTING TO THE SPECTRALLY PURE NEXT TO IT IS THIS MAKINGSENS PERFECT ANS AND IAM GOING TO RIDE DOWN THE NUMBERS IN THOS TWO VOLUME INTENSITY NOVS AND THEN I'M WHEN I ASK THE NEXT PERSON TO DO THE SAME AND THEN THAT WHEN ASKED EVERY PERSON AROUND THESE AREA BATTERY PART IN NEW YORK TO DO THE SAME AND GESS WHAT WE'RE GWEN IIN THAT WITH THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT NUMBER COMBENATIONS AMAZEMENT SO FOR ALL OF US IS YELLOW ENOUGH THAT WE CAN USE ACHOMON LANGUAGE BUT FOR EVERY ONE OF US THAT YELLOW IS WEN TO BE EVER SO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY AND SO I THINK THAT SIMPLE PSYCHOLOGICA EXPERIMENT BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATES HOW WE TRULY PERCEIVE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY ALOV THAT EXAMPLE AND YET IN THAT EXAMPLE WE KNOW THE BASIC ELEMENTS FROM WHICH COLOR IS CREATED IF WE MIGRATE INTO A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SENSE WE TOOK A HARD ONE LIKE SOUND SOUND OR OFACTION YE VERY HARD INTO O AN EXPERIMENT THAT WED ALLOW US TO GET THAT DEGREE OF RANULARITY AND BEAUTIFUL COSALITY WERE WE CAN SHOW THAT E FROBEAUSES AND LEADS TO BE IF I GIVE YOU THE SMELL OF A ROSE YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT TO ME IF I SMELL THE SAME ROSE I CAN DESCRIBE IT ALSO BUT I HAVE NO WAY WHETHER THE TWO OF US OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE SAME BUT IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN BOTH PRETTY MUCH SAY THAT I'T HAS TE FATHELIN ENOUGH FEATURES E OR OTHER THE TERMIANS BUT NO QUESTION THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT THE MINT THE FACT THAT IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR US TO BOTH SURVIVE THAT YOUR PERCEPTION OF YELLOW IN MY PERCEPTION OF YELLOW LE STUP UNTIL NOW IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR US BOTH THE SURVIVE AT RAISES A THOUGHT ABOUT A STATEMENT MADE BY A COLLEAGUE OF OURS MARKES MYSTER AT CALTAC IT'S NEVER BEEN ON THIS PARDCAST BUT IN THE REVIEW THAT I READ A BY MARKESS AT ONE POEN HE SAID THAT THE BASIC FUNCTION OF PERCEPTION IS TO DIVIDE OUR BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES IN TO THAT OUT COMES DOWNSTREAM OF THREE BASIC EMOTIONAL RESPONSES YUM I LIKE IT YUCK I HATE IT OR ME WHATEVER ANI THINK ABOUT I'M NOT LOOKING TO ESTABLISH IN DEBATE BETWEEN YEMARKES WITHOUT  I UNDERSTAND BUTHUTWHAT I LIKE ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THE WE KNOW THE BRAIN IS A VERY ECONOMICAL ORGAN IN SOME SENSE DESPITE ITS HIGH METABOLIC DEMANDS AND THIS VARIATION AND PERCEPTION FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO THE NEXT AT ONCE SEEMS LIKE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'RE ALL LITERALLY SEEN DIFFERENT THINGS AND YET WE FUNCTION WEF FUNCTION WELL ENOUGH FOR MOST OF US TO AVOY IS DEATH AND CLIFFS AND A EATING POISONS AND SO FORTH AND TO ENJOY SOME ASPECTS OF LIFE ONE HOPES SO IS THERE A GENERAL STATEMENT THAT WE CAN MAKE ABOUT THE BRAIN NOT JUST AS A A ORGAN TO GENERATE PERCEPTION NOT JUST AS AN ORGAN TO KEEP US ALIVE BUT ALSO AN ORGAN THAT IS IS TRYING TO BATCH OUR BEHAVIORS INTO GENERAL CATEGORIES OF I THINK I THINK SO BUT BUT AND AGAIN I THINK THE WORLD OF MARCES TO AND I THINK HE'S RIGHT THAT E NOW BROADLY SPEAKING YOU COULD CATIGORISE A LOTHOF BEHAVIOURS FULLING INTO THE THRUE CATEGORIES AND THAT'S ONE HUNDRED PER CENT LIKELY TO BE THE CASE FOR ANIMATIN THE WHILE WERE YO NOW THE CHOICES OR NOT ECESSARILY BANERY BUT THERE VERY UNIQUE AND DISTINCT E DO I WANT A ET THESE DO I WANT A KILL THAT DO I WENT I GO THERE OR DO I WHEN I GO HERE WE HUMANS DEVIATED FROM THAT WORLD LONG AGO AND YOU NOW LEARN TO EXPERIENCE LIVE WERE WE DO THINGS THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING SOME OF US MORE THAN OTHERS EXACTLY OU NOW   I I I IN MY OWN WORLD OF TASTE E THE LIKEL WO THAT AN ANIMAL IN THE WHILE WILL ENJOY EATING SOMETHING BE TER IT'S INCONCEIVABLE YIT WE YOU NO LOVE TONI WATER WE INJO WE LIKE LEAVING ON THE AGE I WE IN LOVE ENJOYING EXPERIENCES THAT MAKES US HUMAN AND THAT GOES BEYOND THAT SIMPLE SIT OF CATEGORIES WHICH IS YAME EYAKI A WHO CARES  AND SO I THINK IS NOT A BAT PALOT BUT I THING IS IT IT'S OVERLY REDUCTIONIS FOR CERTAINLY WHAT WE HUMANS DO AGREEIN THEM SINCE WE HEAR IN NEW YORK I CONSIDER THE MANY OPTIONS THE EXTENSIVE VARIETY OF FOOD FLORA AND FAUNA IN NEW YORK EXPLAINS A LOT OF THE MORE NEW ONTS BEHAVIORS THAT WE OBSERVE LET'S TALK ABOUT TASTE BECAUSE LL YOU'VE DONE EXTENSIVE WORK IN THE FEELD OF VISION AND IT'S A TOPIC THAT I LOVE IT SPEND ALL DAY ON TASTE IS FASCINATING FIRST ALL I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY YOU MIGRATED FROM STUDYING VISION TO STUDYING TASTE AND PERHAPS IN THAT DESCRIPTION YOU CAN HOW LI TUS WHY WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT AND HOW WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE SENSE OF TASTE MY GALL IS ALWAYS BEEN TO UNDERSTAND AS I HA LED BEFOR HOW THE BRAIN DOES ITS MAGIC YOU KNOW WHAT PART YOU MY WONDER I DEALLY LIKE TO HELL CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF ITS OU KNOW HOW HOW DO YOU IN CODE AND THE CODE EMOTIONS HOW DO YOU NCODE AND THECODE MEMORIES AND ACTIONS HOW DO YOU MAKE THECISIONS HOW DO YOU TRANSFORM DETECTION INTO PERCEPTION AND THE LEAST GOES ON AND ON BUT ONE OF THE CHEATINGS IN SCIENCE AS YOU KNOW IS INSURING THAT YOU ALWAYS ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION SO THAT YOU HAVE AN FOR CIVILITY OF ANSWERING BECAUSE IF THE QUESTION CAN NOT BE TRACTABLE OR REDUCED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL PATH THAT HELPS YOU RESOLVE IT THEN WE IN THAM DOING SOME REALLY FUNE SCIENCE BUT NOT NECESSARILY ANSWERING THE IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT WE WANT TO STUDY MAKEENSE FROM A FIRST PERSON PERCECT YES THAT THE HARDEST QUESTION THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU GO WHAT QUESTION ARE YOU GOING TO TRYN Y YEAND SO AND SO FOR EXAMPLE I WOULL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE NURAL BASIS OF EMPATY TE BIG MITED FOR THAT  ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BUT BUT I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW I MEAN AT THE MOLICULAR LEVEL IT THAT'S WHAT WE DO HOW DO THES CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN CREATE THAT SENS I HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO DO IT I CAN COME UP WITH WAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT BUT I LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IN YOUR BRAIN MAKES SOME ONE A GREAT PHILANTHROPIES WHAT IS THE NEURAL BASIS OF LOVE I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN SO IF I WONE NO BEGIN TO STUDY THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT BRAINED FUNCTION THAT CAN COVER SO MANY ASPECTS OF THE BRAIN I NEED TO CHOOSE A PROBLEM THAT AFFORDS ME THAT WINDOW BUT IN A WAY THAT I CAN ASK QUESTIONS A GIV ME ANSWERS AND AMONG THE SENSES THAT YOU KNOW HAVE THE CAPACITY OF TRANSFORMING DETECTION INTO PERCEPTION OF BEING STOROUS MEMORIES OF CREATING EMOTIONS OF GIVING YOU DIFFERIN THDIFFERENT ACTIONS AND PERCEPTIONS AS A FUNCTION OF THE INTERNAL STATE YOU KNOW WHEN YOURE HANGERYTHINGS TATES VERY DIFFERENTLY THAT WHEN YOUARE SATIT HOW WHY WHEN YOU TASTE SOMETHING YOU KNOW REMEMBER THESE AMAZING ME OL YOU HAD WITH YOUR FIRST DATE HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN OR I SO SO IF I WONE NO BEGIN TO EXPLORER ALL THESE THINGS THAT THE BRAIN TAS I FELL I HAVE TO CHOOSE A CENSORY SYSTEM THAT AFFORDS SOME DEGREE OF SIMPLICITY IN THE WAY THAT THE IMPUD OUT PUT RELATIONSHIPS ARE PUT TOGETET AND IN A WAY THAT STILL CAN BE USED TO ASK EVERY ONE OF THESE PROBLEMS THAT THE BRAIN HAS TO ULTIMATELY COMPUTE IN COD AND THE COD AND WHAT WAS REMARKABLE ABOUT THE TASTSYSTEM AT THE TIME THAT I BEGAN WORKING ON THIT IS THAT NOTHING WAS KNOWN ABOUT THE MOLEGULAR BASIS OF TASTE IN A WE NEW THAT WE COULD TASTE WHAT HAS BEEN USUALLY TEFINE AS THE BAT THE FIVE BASIC TASTE QUALITIES SWEET SOUR BETER SALTY AND UMAMI UMAMI S A JAPANESE WORD THAT MEANS THE YAMI DELICIOUS AND THAT'S AND NEARLY EVERY ANIMAL SPECIES THE TASTE OF A MINOASIS AND IN HUMANS IS MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TASTE OF EMISGI MONOSODIUM GLUTAMITE ONE AMINOASITHING PARTICULAR WHAT JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE SOME FRUIDS THAT ARE RICHINIUUMAM EVOKING A STIMULATION SEE WEED TO MAT OS CHEESE AND IT'S A GREAT GREAT FLAVOR IN HANSER IT IN RICHES OUR ENSORY EXPERIENCE AND SO THE BEAUTIFUL THING OF THE SYSTEM IS THAT THE LIINS OF IMPUD ARE LIMITED TO FIVE IN  SWEETS OUR BITISOTIANMAMI AND EACH OF THEM HAS A PREAT DETERMINE MEANING YOU ARE BORN LIKIN SUGAR AND DISLIKING BITTER YOU HAVE NO CHOICE IS A HARD WIRE SYSTEMS BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN LEARN TO DISLIKE SUGAR AND TO LIKE BITTERS BUT IN THE WILD THIS THIC HUMANS OUT OF THE QUESTION TET THIS ARE AND REPERSENT PREDETERMINE YOURE BORN WI THAT SPECIFIC VELINS VALUE FOR ISH TASTE OF SWEET UMAMI AND LOW SALT ARE ATTRACTIVE TASTE QUALITIES THE EVOGUE A PETITYE RESPONSES I WANT O CONSUME THEM AND BEACTER AND SOUR ARE INNATELY PREDETERMINE TO BE AVERSIVE COULD I INTERRUPT YOU JUST REEFULLY AND ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THAT EXACT POINT FOR SOMETHING TO BE APPETITIVE TO THAND SOME MOTHER TASTE TO BE AVERSIVE AND FOR THOSE TO BE HARD WIRED CAN WE ASSUME THAT THE SENSATION OF VERY BITTER OR ACTIVATION OF BITTER RECEPTORS IN THE MOUTH ACTIVEAT CIGNORAL CIRCUIT THAT CAUSES CLOSING OF THE MOUTH RETRACTION OF THE TONGUE AND RETRACTION OF THE BODY AND THAT THE CASTE OF SOMETHING SWEET MIGHT ACTUALLY INDUCE MORE WICKIN A HUNDRED PERCENT YOU GOT IT IT THE ACTIVATION OF THE RECEPTORS IN THE TONGUE THAT RECOGNIZE SWEET VERSES THAT ONES THAT RECOGNIZE BITTER ATIVATE AN ENTIRE BEHAVOAL PROGRAMM AND THAT PROGRAMM THAT WE CAN REFER ASS A PETITIVENESS OR AVERSION IT'S COMPOSE OF MANY DIFFERENT SABROUTINES IN THE CASE OF BITTER IS VERY EASY TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT SEE THEM HAPPENING IN ANIMALS BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DUCE YOU STOP LEAKING THEN YOU PUT A UNHAPPY FASTE THEN YOUR SQUEEN YOUR EYES E AND THEN YOU START GODIN AND THAT ENTIRE THING HAPPENE BY THE ACTIVATION OF A BITTER MOLECULE IN A BITTERSENSIN SEL IN YOUR TONGUE INGETAS EX IIT'S IT'S AGAIN THE MAGIC OF THE BRAIN YOU KNOW HOW HOW IT IT'S ABLE TO INCODE AND THE COD THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTIONS AN BEHAVIOURS IN RESPONSE OF NATHING BY THE SIMPLE VERY TIN O EY  UNIQUE CENSURY STIMULA NOW LET ME SAY THAT THIS PALOT OF FIVE ASIC TASTES A COMODATES ALL THE DIETARY NEEDS OF THE ORGANISM SWEET AN SURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ENERGY WO MAMI T ENSURE THAT WE GET PROTAINS AND THAT THE CENSIAL NUTRAN SALT THE THREE APETITIV ONES WEN SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN OUR ELICTRALIBALANCE BITTER TO PREVENT THE INGESTION OF TOXIC NOCIOUS CHEMICALS NEARLY ALL BILITATIN IN O THINGS OUT IN THE WHILE AR BAD FOR YOU AND SOWER MOST LIKELY TO PREVEN TINGESTION OF SPOIL ASID FERMENTED FOODS AND THAT'S IT THAT IS THE PALET THAT WE DEAL WITH NOW OF COURSE I'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TASIC TASTE AND FLAVOR FLAVOR IS THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE FLAVOR IS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TASTES COMING TOGET IT TO GET ET WIT SMEL WITH TEXTURE WITH TEMPERATURE WITH THE LOOK OF IT THAT GIVES YOU WHAT YOU AND I WOULD CALL THE FULL SENSEOR EXPERIENCET BUT BY WE SCIENTIS ME TO REDUCE THE THE PROVLEM INTA S BASIC ELEMENTS SO WE CAN BEGIN TO BREAK IT APART BEFORE WE PUT IT BACK TO GIT SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE SENSE OF TASTE AND WE TRY TO FIGURE A HOW THIS LYINES OF INFORMATION GO FROM YOUR TONGUE TO YOUR BRAIN AND HOW THEY SIGNAL AND HOW THEY I INTEGRATED AND HOW THEY TRIGURE ALL THIS DIFFERENT BEHAVIOURS WE LOOK AT THEM AS INDIVIDUAL QUALITIES SO WE GIVE THE ANIMAL SWEET OR WE GIVE THEM A BITTER WE GIVE THEM SOUR WE AVOID MEEXES BECAUSE THE FIRST STATE O THISCOVERY IS TO HAVE THAT CLARYTY AS TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO EXTRACT SO THAT YOU CAN HOPEFULLY MEANINGFULLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE BYT E BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW EASY THAT EY GOES TO BE TO SEE IN TO THE THIS HIS MAKES ME OUT N ALMOST LIKE THE PRIMARY COLORS TO CREATE THE FULL ARRAY OF THE GAROSPACTOR EXACTLY BEFORE I ASK YOU BUT THE THE FIRST AND SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF TASTE AND FLAVOR PERCEPTION IS THERE ANY IDEA THAT THERE MAY BE MORE THAN FIVE THE THEORIES FOR EXAMPLE E WHAT ABOT FAT I LOVE THE I LEFT FAT TO AND I LOVE THE TEXTURE OF FAT ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SLIGHTLY BURNT LIKE THE THE IN SOUTH AMERICA WHEN I VISIT BONOSIRIS I FOUND THAT AT THE END OF A MEAL THEY WOULD TAKE A STAKE THE TRIMMING OFF THE EDGE OF THE STAKE BURN IT SLIGHTLY AND THEN SERVE IT BACK TO ME AND I THOUGHT THAT'S DISCUSTING AND THEN I TASTED IT AND IT'S DELIGHTFUL IT IS THERE'S NOTHING QUIHTE LIKE IT THETHIS GOES BACK TO THIS NOTION BEFORE THAT WE LIKE TO LIVE ON THE IDGE THE AND WE LIKE TO DO THINGS THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING ANDREW BUT ON THE OTHER HAND LOOK AT THOSE MUSCLES THE THETH  BY BAJO SUGGESTANYON ER A I LISTERS A FA AS ON AN LLET AM SURE THER BE A BUTIBIDIOSEN THAT I LIKE EATING PURE FAT I'M NOT IN ONACHIDOGENIC DIET ET CETERA BUT OM BUT FAT IS TASTI E ATHE EVIDENCE BY SO YO BECITY PROBLEM THAT EXISTIN AN WO WAN TALK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOWING A LITTLVIN ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE GOT BRAIN AXES I I THINK WE'LL IMPORTANT TO COVER IT BECAUSE IT'S THE ATE SIDE OF THE TASE SYSTEM AND AND SO SO MESING TASTE IN A ONYS FAT O THO LIKE YOU CLEARLY HIGH LIKHE IT A LOT OF FAT TASTE INQUOTATION MARS IT'S REALLY THE FEELING IT OF FAT ROLLING ON DU TONGUE AND SO THE SAID A COMPELLING ARGUMENT THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE CALL FATASTE IT'S REALLY MAKEANO SENSORY IS SO MUCH O SENSORYCELLS SELLS THERE NO RESPONDING TO TASTE BUT THER RESPONDING TO MECANICAL STIMULATION OF FAT MOLICLS ROLLING ON THE TONGUE THAT GIVES YOU THAT PERCEPTION OF FAT I LOVE THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A PERCEPTION OF FAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THERE'S A DEDICATED RECEPTOR REVADED MOSTY BECAUSE IT'S MAKE DEVOKING SENSATIONS AND IMAGERY O OF THE TASTE ISLIGHTLY BURNT FAT  FOR FOR EXAMPLE YE AND ANOTHER ONE YOU KNOW YOU COULD ARGUEIS METALLIC TASTE YOU KNOW I I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT TASTE LIKE YOU KNOW YOU ASKE ME TO EXPLAIN IT I WILL HAVE A HAR TIME YOU KNOW WHAT WHETHER THE POLITES OF THAT COLLOR THAT CAN ALLOW ME TO DEFINE IT I I A I WOULDN'T BE EASY BUT I KNOW PRECISELY WHAT IT TASTE I OUNO TIKE A TAKE A PENNY PUT IN YOUR MOUTH AND YOU KNOW WHAT I TASTE LIKE I OR BLOOW BLOOD THAT ANOTHEN VERY GOOD EXAMPLE AND IS THERE REALLY IN A RECEPTR FOR METALLIC TASTE OR ITS NOTHING BUT THIS MAGIC OL COMBINATION OF THE ACTIVATION OF THE EXISTING LINES THINK OF I THE SLINES OF INFORMATION YE SIPEROLIZE BY THE KEYS OF A PIANO YE SWEET TOUR BITESOLTOMAMA YOU PLAY THA KEY AND YOU ACULATE AT ONE CORD AND THAT WHEN CORD IN THE CASE OF A PIANO LEADS TO A NOTE YOU KNOW AT TUNE AND IN THE CASE OF TASELY TO AN ACTION AND A BEHAVIOR BUT YOU PLAYD MANY OF THEM TOGETHER AND SOMETHING EMERGES THAT ITS DIFFERENT THAN ANY ONE OF THE PIECES AND IT'SPOSIBLE THA METALLIC FOR EXAMPLE REPRESENTS THE COMBINATION OF THE ACTIVITY YAS IN THE RIGHT RATION MAKE OF THES ADILINES IN MAKESENTS AND A AHY PORISE OF PERFECT THE YOUR TEMPLE OF THE PIANO PROITS A PERFECT SIWAY FOR WHAT I LIKE TO TOUCH ON NEXT WHICH IS IF YOU WOULD DESCRIBE THE SECUENTE O NOUROL EVENTS LEADING TO A PERCEPTIOBLE EVENT OF TASTE AND I'M CERTAIN THAT SOMEWHERE AND THERE A YOU'LL IN BED AND ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT WE INDEED HAVE DIFFERENT TASTE RECEPTORIS DISTRIBUTED IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ON OUR TONGUE TOU ERE ELSEWHERE IN THE MOUTH IS SO SO LIT LITSTERT BY BY BY THIBANKING THAT THAT OLD TAL AND MEAT WHO CAME OVER THAT I THI THERARE MANY VUWSE BUT THE THE MOST PRIVOLING I THAT THERE WAS AN ORIGINAL DRAWING DESCRIBING THE SENSITIBITY OF THE TONGUE TO DIFFERENT TASTES SO IMAGINE I CAN TAKE A CUTIP THIS IS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IT AND AND WHEN I DID THAT CUTIVENING SOLD AND IN QUININ A SOMETHING BITTER AND GLUKEOS A SOMETHING SWEET AND AND WHEN I TAG THAT CUTIBASIO TO STIG YOUR TONGUE OUT AND STAR MOVING AROUND YOUR TONGUE AND ASK YOU WHAT DO YOU FEEL AND THEN AM GOING TO CHANGE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE AMANOF SOLD OR THE MOUNT OF BITTER AND ASK CANNI GIT SOME SORT OF A MAP OF SENSITIVITY TO THE DIFFERENT TASTE AND AND THE ARGUMENT THAT HAS SEMERGE I SAID THERE'S A GOOD LIKELIOOD THAT THI DID TAT WAS SIMPLY MISTRANS LATED AS HE WAS BEING DRAWN AND OF COURSE THAT LATE TON ENTIRE INDUSTRY THIS IS THE WAY YOU MAXIMISE ERRER WINE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO FORM THE VESSEL THAT YOU'RE CON A RING FROM SO THAT IT ACS MAXIMALLY ON THE RECEPTRES WHICH HAVN OLIFE NOW THERE IS NO TONGUE MAP NO LI WE HAVE TASTE BATS DISTRIBUTED IN VERIOUS PARTS OF THE TONGUE SO THERE IS A MAP ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF TASTEPATS BUT IS TASTBAT HAS A RUN A HAND RED TASTE RECEPTRSELVS AND THOS TASTE RECEPT RSELVES CAN BE OF FIVE TIPES IT SWEET SOUR BITISOLTY OR MAMMY AND FOR THE MOST PART ALL TASTEBAT HAVE THE REPRESENTATION OF ALL FIVE TASTE QUALITIES NOW THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE IS A SLIDE BY US FOR SOME TAYS LIKE BITTER IS PARTICULARLY EN RICH AT THE VERY BACK OF YOUR TONGUE AND THERE IS THAT THYLIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR THAT ACTUALLY A BIOLOGICAL PASED FOR THAT THAT'S THE LAST LINE OF THE FENCE BEFORE YOU SWALLOW SOMETHING BAD AND SO LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THE VERY BACK OF YOUR TONGUE HAS PLENTY OF THESE BAD OSE RECEPTORS SO THAT IF THEY IT ACTIVATED YOU CAN TRIGGER A GAGGING REFLEXS AND GIVE RID OF THIS THAT OTHERWISE MAY KILLD YOU I CODSENS BUT BYT THE NOTION THAT IN ALL SWEETIES IN THE FROND AND SOLDIS ON THE SI IT IT'S NOT REAL AND THE GY OH I SUS CAN ASK ARE THER THET FIRST WILL THANK YOU FOR THE SWELLING TAT MITH AND WE WILL PROPAGATE THAT INFORMATION AS FAR AND WIDE AS WE CAN LIXEITHING THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE METY RELATED TO HE TASTE THE OTHER ONE IS ARE THEIR TASTE RECEPTORS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE MOUTH AF FER INSTANCE ON TEANIBASAT THE PALAT NOTHE LIPS SO ITS ITS IN THE FARINGE AT THE VERY BACK OF THE ORAL CAVITY THE TONGUE AND THE PALAT AND THE PALATISE VERY RIG AND SWEET RECEPTORS I YE PAY ATTENTION OF THIS THE NEXT TIME I EAT SOMETH DERY WHETHER WHETHER WUL YOU PULL IT AP YET NOW IN THEY THE THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT OU KNOW AFTER THE RECEPTORS FOR THESE FIVE THE THE DETECTORS THE MOLECUE THAT SINS SWEETS OUR BETESOLTOMAMI THESE ARE RECEPTORS PROTAINS FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF TASTE RECEPTRCELVES THAT INTERRACT WITH THESE CEMICALS AND ONCE THE INTERACT IN THE TRIGGER THE CASCADE OF EVENTS BY A CHEMICALEVENTS INSIDE ITSELL THAT NOW SENDS AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL THAT SAYS THERE IS SWEET HERE OR THERE IS SOLE HERE NOW HAVING THESE RECEPTRS AND MY LAVORATORY IDENTIFY THE RECEPTRES FOR ALL FIVE BASIC TASTE GLASSES SWEED BITTERSOL TO MAMY AND MOST RECENTLY SOUR NO COMPLETING THE PILOT YOU CAN NOW USE THES RECEPTRS TO REALLY MAP WHERE ARE THEY FOUND IN THE TONGUE IN A VERY RIGOROUS WAY THIS IS NO LONGER ABOUT USE IN TA CUTY AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR FEELING BUT RATHER WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR TONGUE I THIS IS NOT A GEST THIS IS NOW A FEASTY GALMAP THAT'S IS DE SWEET RECEPTRES ARE FOUND HERE THE BITTER ARE FOUN HERE AND WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU FIND THAT IN FACT EVERY TASTE BAT THROU OUT YOUR ORIAL CAFITI HAS RECEPTRS FOR ALL OF THE BASIC TASTE GLASSES AMAZING AND IMAS IT TURNS OUT AN UMSURE YOU'LL TELL US IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN COMPUTES AND CODES ISY CODES THIS THING WE CALL TASTE YS I'M GOING TO INJECT A QUICK QUESTION THAT I'M SURE IS ON MANY PEOPLE'S MINDS BEFORE WE GET BACK INTO THE BIOLOGICAL CIRCUIT WHICH IS MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FOR FAMILIAR WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF DRINKING A SEP OF TEA OR COFFEE THAT IS TOO HOT AND BURNING MY TONGUE IS THE WAY I WOER ILAND HORRIBLE AND THEN DESRUPTING MY SENSE OF TASTE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME AFTERWARD YES WHEN I EXPERIENCE THAT PHENOMENON THAT UNFORTUNATE PHENOMENON HAVE I DESTROYED TASTE RECEPTORS THAT REGENERATE OR HAVE I SOMEHOW USE TEMPERATURE THE DISTORT THE FUNCTION OF THE CIRCUIT SO THAT I NO LONGER TASTE THE WAY I DID BEFORE EXCELLENT QUESTION AND THE ANSWERIS BOTH IT TURNS OUT THAT YOUR TASTE RECEPTRS ONLY LEAVE FOR AROUND TWO WEEKS AND THESPYTE THE WAY MAKE SENSE BECAUSE HERE YOU HAVE AN ORGAN THE TONGUE IT THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED TO EVERYTHING YOU COULD RANGE FROM THE NICEST WO THE MOST HORRIBLE POSSIBLE THINGS IS YOUR IMAGINATIONAND SO IT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE SELLS ARE ALWAYS COMING BACK IN A WAY THAT I CAN A REEXPERIENCE THE WORLD IN THE RIGHT WAY AND THIS THER ATE ORGANS THAT HAVE THE SAME AND TER LYING LOGIC OK YOU'RE GOT YOUR INTESTINS ARE THE SAME WAY AMAZING AGAIN THEYRE RECEIVING EVERYTHING THAT YOU INJEST GOT FORBID WHAT'S THERE IT FROM THESPISIES YI KNOW TO THE MOST HORRIBLE TASTINGS OR THE MOST DELICIOUS AND AGAIN THOS INTESTINAL SELVES WAS RALL IS TO ULTIMATELY TAKE ALL THES NEUTRIANCS AND BRING THEM INTO THE BODY ALSO RENEWAL IN A VERY VERY FAST CYCLE IT O FACTORY NURANCE IN YOUR NOWSE IS THEY Y EXAMPLE SO THEN E YES YOUR BURNING A LOT OF YOURSELVES AND IS OVER FOR THOSE THE GOOD NOWS IS THAT THE'E ON NO COME BACK BUT WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU BURN YOURSELF WIT TE DIY COME BACK YOU KNOW WIHIN TOEN THE MEAN OTS THE REMIN AS AN HOUR AND THES SELTER NOT RENEWININ THAT IN THAT TIME FRANKY THEYARE NOT LISTENING TO YOUR NEEDS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INTERNAL CLOK ITAND S YOU ARE REALLY AFFECTING YOUR DAMAGING THEM IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN RECOVER AND THEN THEY COME BACK AND YOU ALSO THEM AS YOUR SOMATO CENSORY SELVES THIS ARE THE CELLS THAT FEL THINGS NOT TESTE THINGS AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU WAIT HALF AN HOUR OR SO AN THEN MY GOODNESS THIN GOD IT'S BACK TO NORMON AND MOST THE TIME I DON'T EVEN NOTICE THE TRANSITION REALIZING AS YOU TELL ME AND OUT LATER ALL ASK YOU ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ODER AND TASTE BUT AM AS THE NEXT STEP ALONG THE CIRCUIT BUT SUSSUME Y INJEST SOME LET US KEEP IT SIMPLE A A SWEET TASTE LET'S MAKE IT EVEN IT SIMPLER BUT THAT THE SAME TIME PERHAPS MORR INFORMITY LET'S COMPER AND CONTRAST SWEET AND BITTER AS WE FOLLOW THEIR LYINES FROM THE TONGUE TO THE BRAIN SO THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE TWO OVOGUE DIAMENTRICALLY OPPOSED BEHAVIOURS IF WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH TWO CENSURY EXPERIENCE THAT REPRESENT POLLAR OPOSITES IT WOULL BE SWEET AND BITTE THEYARE NO TWO COLLERS THAT REPRESEMPLEAR OPPOSITES BECAUSE IT XS A BLACK AND WHITE APPOLAR OPPOSITE TO ONE THAT TAKES ONLY ONE THING THAT WHEN TIT TAKES EVERYTHING ITBUT THEY DON'T EVOGUE THIFFEREN BEHAVIORS EVEN TE MILICAL PARTIES HAVE SOME OVER SWEET AND BITTER ARE THE TWO OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE CENSORY SPECTR NOW A TASTE CAN BE THE FINE BY TWO FEATURES AND AGAIN A MY REDUCTION I SOM REDUCING IT IN A WAY THAT I THINGIS EASIER TO FOLLOW THE SIGNAL AND THE TWO FEATURES ARE ITS QUALITY AND ITS VELANS AND VELANS WITH A LITTLE V THAT'S WHAT WE SAY INSPANISH WITH A V I MEANS THE VALUE OF THAT EXPERIENS I OR IN THIS CASE OF THAT STIMULI AND YOU TAKE SWEET SWEET AS A QUALITY AND IDENTITY AND THAT'S WHAT YOU AND I WULD REFER TO US THE TASTE O SWEET WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT TASTE LIKE BUT SWEET ALSO HAS A POSITIVE VALINS WHICH MAKES IT INCREDIBLY ATTRACTIVE AND APETITYE BUT IS ATTRACTIVE AN APETITY AS I'LL TELL YOU NA SECON INDEPENDENT OF ITS IDENTITY AND QUALITY IN FACT WE HAVEBEEN ABLE TO INGINEER ANIMALS WERE WE COMPLETELY REMOVE THE VALINS FROM THE STIMULI SO THIS ANIMALS CAN TASTE SWEET CAND RICOGNIZE IT AS SWEET BUT IT'S NO LONGER ATTRACTIVE IT SEE US ONE MORE CANMICAL STIMULA AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE IDENTITY AND THE VALINS ARE INCODED IN TWO SEPARAT PARTS OF THE BRAIN IN THE CASE OF BITTER AGAIN IT HAS ON THE ONE HAND ITS IDENTITY ITS QUALITY AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT BER TASTE LIKE I CAN TASTIT NOW EVEN AS YOU DESCRIBED BUT IT ALSO HAS A VALINS AND THAT'S A NEGATIVE VALINTS BECAUSE I THE BOGUES AVERSY BEHAVIORS ARE WE ON ABSOLUTELY OLIE AND IT COMES TO MY I REMEMBER TELLING SOME KIDS REASON WHEN THE WREN E GOE ICE CREAM HN IT WAS INTERESTING THEY LOOKED UP AND THEY STARTED SMACKING THE WE LIKE YOU KNOW DOUT ATUALY VO ANTISIPATORY RESPONDS ABSOLUTELY THE WON WE TOK ABOUT THE GAD BRAIN EN YOU WILL GET THERE I SO THEN THE SIGNALS IF WE FOLLOWED NOW HIS TWO LINES THE REALLY LIKE TWO SEPARATE KEYS AT THE TWO ENDS OF THE SCHIMOR AND YOU FIRS ONE KEY AND YOU ACTIVATE SCORD SO YOU ACTIVATTHE SWEET CELLS THROUGHOUT YOUR ORAL CAVITY AND THEY ALL CONVERSE INTO A GROUP OF SWEET NURANS IN THE NEXT TATION WHICH IS SILL OUTSIDE THE BRAIN IS ONE OF THE TASTE GANGLEA THIS ARE THE NURANS THAT INTERVAD YOUR TONGUE AND THE ROYAL CAVITY WERE THE IS I APPROXIMATELY AN H SON THER EE HEROLE BUT LINGTH NOTES MORE LASDUGAVIT AND AND AND THEIR TWO MAIN ANGIA WTHAT INTERVADE THE VASMAJORITY OF OLD TASTE BUDS IN THE ROL CAVITY AND THEN FROM THERE THAT SWEET SIGNAL GOES ON TO THE BRAINS STEM THE BRINS THEM IS THE INTRY OF THE BODY INTO THE BRAIN AND THERE DIFFERENT ARIES OF THE BRAINS TEM AND THEIR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF NURANS IN THE BRAINS TEM AND TIS AS UNIQUE AREA IN A UNIQUE A A A TOPOGRAPHICALLY THE FINE I LOCATION IN THE ROSTRAL SIDE OF THE BRAINS THEM THAT RECEIVES ALL OF THE TASTE INPUT VERY DENSE AREA EBRAN A VERY RICH AREA  OF THE BRAIN EXACTLY AND FROM THERE THE SWEET SIGNAL GOES TO THIS OTHER AREA HIGHER AP ON THE BRAIN STEM AND THEN IT GOES TRO A NUMBER OF STATIONS WHERE THAT SWEET SIGNAL GOES FROM SWEET NURAN TO SWEETENURON TO SWEET NURAN TO EVENTUALLY GET TO YOUR CORTICS AND ONCE IT GETS TO YOUR TASTE CORTICS THAT'S WERE MEANING IS IMPOSE INTO THAT SIGNAL IT'S THEN AND ONLY THEN THIS IS WHAT THE DAY THA SUGGESTS THAT NOW YOU CAN IDENTIFY THESE AS A SWEET STIMULI AND HOW QUICKLY DOES THAT ALL HAPPEN IM IN A THE TIME SCALE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ITS FASTE AND WAS NON A SECOND YE ABSOLUTELY I RARELY MISTAKE BETTER FOR SWEET YE MAYBE WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE AND MY OWN POOR JUDGMENT BUT BUT NOW YOU O  LADLY RESPECTIT YE IT'S AND AND IN FACT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THIS BECAUSE WE CAN STICK ELETRODS AT EACH OF THES STATIONS CONCEPTIONALLYEH AND WE CAN STIMULATE E TONU AND THEN WE CAN RECORD THE SIGNALS PRETTY MUCH TINY LOG TO STIMULUS DELIVERY YOU DELIVER THE STIMULA AND WITHIN A FRACTION OF A SECOND YOU SEE NOW THE RESPONSE IN THIS FOLLOWING STATIONS NOW IT GETS TO THE CORTICS E AND NOW IN THERE YOU IMPOSE MEANING TO THAT TASTE THERE'S AN AREAR YOUR BRAIN THAT REPRESENTS THE TASTE OF SWEET IN TASTE CORTICS AND A DIFFERENT AREA THE REPRESENTS THE TASTE OF BITTER IN ISN'T THERE IS A TOPOGRAPHIC MAP OF THIS TASE QUALITIES INSIDE YOUR BRAIN NOT WE'RE GOING TO DO A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT ALIE IF THIS GROUP OF NURANS IN YOUR CORTICS REALLY REPRESENTS THE SENSE OF SWEET AND IS ADDED DIFFERENT GROUP OF NURANS IN YOUR BRAIN REPRESENTS THE TASTE THE PRECEPTION OF BITTER THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO TWO THINGS FIRST I SHOLD ABLE TO GO INTO YOUR BRAIN SOMEHOW SILENCE THOS NURANS FIND A WAY TO PREVENT THEM FROM BE ENACTIVATED AND I CAN GIVE YOU ALL THE SWEET YOU ON AND YOU'LL NEVER KNOW THAT YOUR TASTIN SWEET AND CONVERSELY I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO INTO YOUR BRAIN COME UP THE WAY TO ACTIVATE OS NURANS WELL IND GIVING YOU ABSOLUTELY EINATHING AND YOU'RE GOING A THINK THAT YOUARE GETTING THAT FULL PERSENT AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT YOU GET THIS OF COURSE IS IN THE BRAIN OF MY SE BU PRE UMABLY IN HUMANS IT WOULD WORK SABSOLUTELY THE SAME THE ZERODA I HAVE NOT NO QUESTION SO SO SO THIS A TASTE TO TWO IMPORTANT THINGS THE FIRST TO THE PRETE TERMING NATURE OF THE SENS OF TASTE BECAUSE IT MEANS I CAN GO TO THESE PORTS OF YOUR BRAIN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY STIMULI AND HAVE YOU TRO THE FOOL BEHAVIOR AN EXPERIENCE IN FACT WHEN WE ACTIVA IN YOUR CORTICS THES BITTER NURANCS THE ANIMAL CAN START GAGIN BUT I'S DRINKING ONLY WATER BUT THE ANIMAL THINGS THESGITTING ABIRESTIMLA IS AMAZING AND SO AN DE SEQUENT JEST TO FINISE DELINES SO THAT THE DOESN'T SOUND LIK ETICIOUS TWO THINGS AND THEN THEY ONLY GIVE YOU ONE LISTEN IIS THAT I NO I SUBSTANSIATES THIS THIS CAPACITY OF THE BRAINTO SIGREGATE TO SEPARATE IN IN THIS NOTES OF ACTION THE REPRESENTATION OF THESE TWO DIAMATRICALLY OPPOSE PERSIPS  WHICH IS SWEET FOR EXAMPLE VERSES BE THREAS I SAY AMAZING AND THAT IS ALSO AMAZING IS THE FOLLOWING YOU TOLD US EARLIER IN YOUR ABSOLUTELY CORRECT OF COURSE THAT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER NOT ITS ONE GROUP OF NORANS OVER HERE IN ANOTHER GROUP OF NARNS OVER THERE SWO IT TURNS OUT TO BE THELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IS THE GENERIC COMMON LANGUAGE OF BOTH SETS OF NURANS SO THAT RAISES THE QUESTION FOR ME OF WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SEPARATE SETS OF NURANS ARE CONNECTED TO AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT CREATE THIS SENSE OF VAILANCS OR WHETHER NO THER SIMPLY CREATED CONNECT EXCUSE ME TO SETS OF NURANS THAT E VOKE DISTINCT BEHAVIORS OF MOVING TOWARDS AND INHALING MORE AND LICKING OR AVERSIV ARE WE ENSENTIALLY INTERPRETING OUR BEHAVIOUR AND OUR MICRO RESPONSES OR OR MICHAL RESPONSES IN OUR BEHAVIORS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PERSO EXCELLENT EXCELLENT QUESTION SO SO FIRST THE ANSWER IS THE GOINTO A AREA OF THE BRAIN WERE VELANCE IS IMPOSE AND THAT ARE IS KNOWN AS THE AMIGDEMA AND THE SWEET NURANSCO TO A DIFFERENT AREA THAN THE BIRINURANS NOW I WENT NE DO ATHOGHTIC SPIRM BECAUSE I THINK YOUR ORDINS MY APPRECIATES LET' SAY I ACTIVATE THIS GROUP OF NURANS AND THE ANIMATINCREASI SLEEKING AND M ACTIVATING THE SWETNURANS AND SO THAT'S EXPECTED BECAUSE NOW IS IN O TASTING THES THIS THIS WATER ASIV WAS SUGAR IN A THES IS MOSES TRANSFORMING WATER INTO WINE IN THESE CASE WER EN AND TO THES PASS OVER SOTIN THESE AN APPROPRIATING O EXAMPLE IT WERE TRANSFORMING IT INTON IN IN INTERSWEET IT BUT BUT HOW DO I KNOW HOW DO I NOW THAT ACTIVATNG THEM IS EVOKING A POSITIE FEELING INSIDE A GOODNESS A SATISFACTION OI LOVE IT VERSES AM GES INCREASING LIKING WHICH IS THE ATTE OFTEN BECAUSE ALL WER SEEING IS THAT THE ANIMAL IS SLEEKING MORE AND WE'RE TRYING TO INFAIRER THAT THAT MEANS THAT IS FEELING SOMETHING REALLY GOOD VERSES YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PIANO LINE IS GOING BACK STRAIGHT INTO THE TONGU AND ALL IS DOING IS FORCING IT TO MOVE FASTER WELL WE CAN ACTUALLY SEPARATE IS BY DOING EXPERIMENTS THAT ALLOWS TO FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINGUISH THEM AND IMAGINE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT AND WHEN I TAKE THE ANIMAL AND WHEN A PUTTING INSIDE A BOX THAT HAS TWO SIDES AND THE TWO SIDES HAVE FEATURES AT MAKING DIFFERENT ONE HAS YELLOW LITTL TOYS THE OTHY ONE HAS GREEN TOYS ONE HAS LITTLE IN A BLACK STRIVES THE OTY ONE HAS BLUE STRIPES SO THET ANIMAL CAN TELL TIT TO HAVES I TAKE THE MOUS PUTTING INSIDE THIS ARENA THIS PLAY ARENA AND IT WILL EXPLORER AND PUTS AROUND BOTH SIDES WITH EQUAL FREQUENCY AND NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS AND WHEN I ACTIVYT THIS NURANS THI SWEETN RONMS EVERY TIME THE ANIMAL IS ON THE SIDE WITH THE YELLOW STRIPES AND IF THAT IS CREATING A POSITIVE INTERNAL STATE WHAT WULD THE ANIMAL NOW WANT TO DO I WILL WANE TO STAY ON THE SIDE WITH THE YELLOW STRIPES THERE'S NO LEICKING HERE THE ANIMAL IS NOT EXTENDING ITS STRONG EVERY TIME I'M ACTIVATING THES NUMBER THIS IS KNOWN AS A PLACE PREFERENCE TAST AND IT'S GENERALLY US IS JUST ONE FORM OF ANY DIFFERENT TES TO THEM ON STRAIGT THAT THY ACTIVATION OF A GROUP OF NEERS IN THE BRAIN IS IMPOSING FOR EXAMPLE APOSITIVE VERSES AND NEGATIVE VAILANS WHERS IF THI DO THE SAME THING BY ATIVATING THE BITTER NURATS THE ANIMAL WILL ACTIVELY ONE NOW TO STAY A WAY FROM THE SIDE WERE THESE NURANS ARE BEING ACTIV AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT YOU SAY AND THAT'S PRECISELY MEN WI SAY MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF OR FAMILIAR WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING TO A RESTAURANT EATING A VARIETY OF FOODS AND THEN FORTUNATELY DOESN'T HAPPEN NOT OFTEN BUT THEN FEELING VERY SICK I LEARND COMING UP IN NURROW SCIENCE THAT THIS IS ONE STRONG EXAMPLE OF ONE TRIAL LEARNING THAT FROM THAT POINT ON IT'S NOT THA RESTAURANT OR THE WAGRS OR THE WEIHT HER OR THE DATE BUT IT'S MY NOTION OF IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN THE SHRIMP THAT LEADS ME TO THEN WANT TO AVOID SHRINK IN EVERY CONTECT MAY BE VEN SHRIMK POWDER YOU GOT IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME I CAN IMAGINE ALL THE ADAPT EVOLUTIONARILY ADAPTIVE REASONS WHY THIS SUCH A PHENOMENON WOULD EXIST DO WE HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF WEAR IN THIS PATH WE A DO EXISS WE WE WE KNOW ATUALLY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUND A   AT A GENERAL LEVEL EIF IN FACT MORE THAN SHRINK OYSTERS ARE EVEN AT MORE DROMATIC EXAMPLED DONE BAD OYSTER OF IT'S OLD YOU NEED TO BE DRIVIN THAT WAY FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS I THINK BECAUSE  TEXTUR ALONE IS SOMN THAT  ON OIS T  A CAI A JO OYSTERS  I DESTPISE MOSSERS DESPISE SHRIMP NOT THE ANIMAL BUT THE TASTE AND AND YET OYSTERS FOR SOME REASON TA I'VN YET TO HAVE A BAD I SIAN HES LIKE UNY BY THE WAY YOU NOT TEXTERE IS HARED TO GET OVER BUT WENS YOU GET OVER IT'S DELICIOUS THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME WE WERE BOT CIN SALIETE AT ONE QINE AND I I'LL GIVE A CLUCK TO SO SHE O OS A CAND O A A MYSOTIS AND THEY HAVE AMAZING UNY AND AVE I'VE TRIED IT TWICE AN I IT'S A AM OFER TO IT IT'S SOMEHOW THE TEXTURE OUT WAIGS ANY KIND OF THE DELICIOUSNESS ES PEOPLE  TI AT A VERY ACQUIRED TASTE ESLAY BEER YOU KNOW IF YOU T I GREW UP IN CHILI THAT'S WHERE THE EXCELENT COMES FROM IN CASE ANY ONE WONDER A YOU KNOW BY  TIME WHAT THE TIME I CAME HERE TO GRADISCOOLLI WAS NINETEEN TOO OLD TO THE O OVERKIME MY HEAVY CHILLYAN ACCENT SOON HERE I AM FOR THE YEARS FIFTY YEARS LATE NOQUINE WE WERE THE LASS WE AVRE HAD I STEAL SOUND LIKE A YES CAME OFF BEBOD SO IN CHILLY YOU DON'T DRINK BEER WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG YOU DRINK WINE YE NOT CHILLY A HUR'S WINE PRODUCER SO WHEN THEY CAME TO THE YOUAS ALL OF MY IN A GLASSMATES YO KNOW WERE DRINKIN BEER BECAUSE THEY ETI NO THEY HAVE FINISHED COLLESH WERE THEY WERE OLD IN OF YOURE DRINKIN AND E A GRADIOU SCHOOL YOUR WORKING EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY EVERY DAY THE WA THEYI NOT RELAT LES GO AND HAVE SOME BEERS AND BERASS CHEAFER AVIERS CHAP AND WE WERE BEING CLEARLY UNDERPA ME I A E I COULDN'T DO IT IT'S AN ACQUIRE TASTE E WAS TOO LAD BY THEN AND HERE I AM YE NOW SIXTY PLASS AND IF YOU TAKE ALL THE BEER I'VE DRUNKIN MY ENTIRE LIFE I WOULD SAY THEY ADD TO LES THAN A EIGHT OUNDS GLASS OF WATER IN PRESSET WELL YOUR HEALTH IS PROBABL ATTER EWARE I'M NOT SUR YOUR PHYSICA HEL AT  E  NO E GOES BACK TO E O A ACUIRE TASTE THES THE CONECTION TO UNY AND TO OYSTERS NOW GOING BACK TO TO THE ONE TRIAL LEARNING YE KNOT THE SEES THE GREAT THING OF OUR BRAINS CERTAIN THING S WE NEED TO REPEAT A HUNDRED TIMES TO LEARN THEM A LO OPERATOR CAN I HAVE THE FUL NUMBER FOR SUCI OTAPLICE AND THEN YOU'LL GIVE IT TO YOU OVER THE FON AT LEAST IN THE OLD DAYS AND THEN YOU NEED TO REPEAT IT TO YOURSELVES OVER ANOVER ANOVER VER THE NEXT MINUTE SO YOU CAN DIE OUT SUCI OTTA AND FIVE MINUTES LATER IT'S GONE THAT'S WHAT WE CALL WORKING MEMORY THEN THERE IS THE SHORTER MEMORY IF WE PART OUR COR AND I WERE LACKY BY THE IND OF THE DAY WE REMEMBER WORE ITIS AND THEN THERE IS THE LONG TERM MEMORY WE REMEMBER THE BIRTHDAYS OF EVER EN OF OUR CHILDREN FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES FOR THER EVENS THAT A SINGLE EENTY SOTROMATIC THET E'D ACTIV WADS THE CIRCUITS IN A WAY THAT IT'S A ONTROYAL LEARNING AND THE TASTE SYSTEM IS LITERALLY AT THE TOP OF THAT FOOT CHAIN AND THERE IS HA PHENOMENA KNOWN AS CONDITION TASTE AVERSION YOU CAN PAIR AN ATTRACTIVE STIMULATE WITH A REALLY BAD ONE AND YOU CAN MAKE AN ANIMAL BEGIN TO VEHEMENTLY DISLIKE FOR EXAMPLE SUGAR AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE CONDITION THE ANIMALS TO NOW BE AVERSE TO THES OTHERWISE NICE TAYS BECAUSE HE'S BEING ASSOCIATED WITH MY LADES AND WHEN YOU DO THAT NOW YOU CO BEGIN TO ASK WHY TES CHANGE IN THE SIGNAL AS E TRAVELS FROM THE TONU TO THE BRAIN IN A NORMAL ANIMAL VERSS AN ANIMAL WHERE YOU HAVE NOW TRANSFORMD SWEET FROM BEING ATTRACTIVE TO BEING AVERSIVE AND THIS IS THE WAY NOW YOU BEGIN TO EXPLORE HOW THE BRAIN CHANGES THE NATURE THE QUILITY THE MEANING OF A STIMULA AS A FUNCTION OF ITS STATE I HAVE UT NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO THAT O ALL OF WHICH RELATE TO THE IDEA OF CONTAXT  BECAUSE YOU MENTION BEFORE THAT FLAVOR IS DISTINCT FROM TASTE BECAUSE YOU LAVOR INVOLVE SMELL TEXTURE TEMPERATURE AND I SOME OTHER FEATURES ONLY SE URCHIN BEING A AD EXAMPLE I CAN I CAN SENSE THE TEXTURE IT ASHEST IT NOW I WON'T DESCRIBE WHAT IT WHAT IT REMINDS ME OF FOR VARIOUS REASONS THE ABILITY TO PLACE CONTET ON INTO TO INSERT CONTEXT INTO A PERCEPTION OR RATHER TO INSERT A PERCEPTION INTO CONTEXT IS IS SO POWERFUL AND THEREIS AN ELEMENT OF AND A MYSTERY ABOUT IT BUT IF WE START TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE MORE NEW ONTS THAT WE LIKE TO LIVE AT THE EDGE AS YOU AS YOU SAY HOW HOW MANY DIFFERENT TASTES ON E TASTE DIAL GO BACK TO YOUR ANALEGY EARLY OF THE COLOR DILE DO YOU THINK THAT THERE COULD BE FOR SOMETHING AS UNFIXED AS BITTER SO FORINSENCE I I DON'T THINK I LIKE BITTER TASTE BUT II LIKE SOME FERMENTED FOODS THAT SEEM TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SOUR AND HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BROHT THAT BRINY THE SLAVOR HOW MUCH PLASTICITY DO YOU THINK THERE IS THERE AND IN PARTICULAR ACROSS THE LIFE SPEN BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE MOST SALIENT EXAMPLES OF THIS IS THAT KIDS DON'T SEEM TO LIKE CERTAIN VEGETABLES BUT THEY ALL ARE HARD WIRE TO LIKE SWEET TASTE AND YET YOU COULD ALSO IMAGINE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY MAY EVENTUALLY GROW TO INCORPORATE VEGETABLES IS BECAUSE OF SOME KNOWLEDGE THAT VEGTABLES MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YU BETTER FOR THEM SO IS THERE A CHANGE IN THE RECEPTORS THE DISTRIBUTION THE NUMBER OF SENSITIVELY ET CETERA THEY CAN EXPLAIN THE TRANSITION FROM WANTING TO AVOID VEGETABLES TO BEING WILLING TO VEGETABLES SIMPLY IN CHILDHOOD TO TO SIVALSO THE A WHEN I TAKE THE QUESTION SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY BY THAT THING IT WOULD ILLUSTRATE THE POINT AND AND AN WHEN I GIS ILLUSI   I USE THEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACTORY SYSTEM AND THE TASTE SYSTEM TO MAKE THE POINT THES SISTEM FIVE BASY PALATES SWEIT'S OUR BITST OT OF MONEY EACH OF THEM HAS A PREDETERMING IDENTITY WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT AN VAILINGS THIS ARE ATTRACTED THIS REVERSIVE IN THE FACTORY SYSTEM IT'S CLAIM THAT WE CAN SMELL MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT OTHERS YET FOR THE MOST PART NONE OF THEM HAVEN IN NADE PREDETERMING MEANING IN THE FACTORY SYSTEM MEANING IS IMPOSED BY LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE EVEN THE SMELL OF SMOKE SO I'M WEN I GIVE YOU I'M WON A MAKE IT DIFFERENT THER ARE A HANDFUL OF THE MILLIONS OF ATHERS THAT WERE CLAIM THAT THAT YOU COULD IMMEDIATELY TELL ME THES ARE AVERSID AND THIS ARE ATTRACTED VOMEN SO VONMY IT'S NOT CORRECT BECAUSE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THERE CULTURES AND SOCIETIES WERE THINGS WHICH ARE FAR THES APPEALING THAN VOME DO NOT EVOKE AN AVERSIVE REACTION REALLY REALLY SO FOR WOULD BE MAYBE AS UNIVERSAL I'M NOT LOOKING FIRAMONTS OR  FIR MONTS ARE IN THE DIFFERENT CATEGORY THAT TRIGUR INADE RESPONSES BUT NERLY EVERY OTHER IS AFORDED MEANING BY LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S WHY YOU LIKE BROKERLY AND I DESPISE PROKERLY BECAUSE I REMEMBER MY MATHER FORCING ME TO EAT BROKME SO SAME SENSORY EXPERIENCE IT ALRIGHT THES THES ARE COME WO THES TWO IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE CASE OF TASTE YOU HAVE NUWRUNCS AT EVERY STATION THAT THERE FOR SWEET FOR SOUR FOR PITTER FOR SOLTY ANE MONEY IT'S ONLY FIVE CLASSES SO IT'S NOT NNA TAKE A LOT OF YOU BRAIN IF WE CAN INFACT SMELL A MILLION OTERS AND EVERY ONE US AF OTHERS HAD TO HAV PREDETERMINE MEANING THERE'S NO ON A BE ENOUGH BRAIN YES TO A COMMODATE THAT ONE SENSE AND SO EVOLUTION IN ITS INFINITE WISDEM IT I EVOLVE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU PUT TOGETHER A PATHWAY AND A CORTIX OF AFTORY CORTICI WERE YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ASSOCIATE EVERY OTER IN A SPECIFIC CONTECTS THAT NOW GIVES IT THE MEANING NOW IT'S GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION THEM SO OTHER THAN CLEARLY PLASTIC MAKE A PLASTIC BECAUSE IT'S IT'S FUNDAMENTAL BASIS AND NEURAL ORGANIZATION BUT TASTE WE HAS TOLD YOU THAT SEN O PREDETERMING HARD WIRE BUT PREDETERMINE HARD WORE IT AS A MEANATS NOT MODULATED BY LEARNING OR EXPERIENCE IT ONLY MEANS THAT YOU ARE BORN LIKE IN SWEET AND THISLIKING BITTER AND WE HAVE MANY EXAMPLES OF PLASTICITY BEER BEING ONE EXAMPLE SO WHAT WHY DO WE LEARN TO LAUGH BEER IS IN A COFFEE IS BECAUSE IT HAS AN ASSOCIATED GAIN TO THE SYSTEM AND THAT GAIN TO THE SYSTEM THAT POSITIVE VEILINGS THAT EMERGES OUT OF THAT NEGATIVE SIGNAL IS SUFFICIENT TO CREATAT POSITIVE ASSOCIATION AND IN THE CASE OF BEER OF COURSE IS AUT GALL THE FEELING GOOD THAT WE GET AFTER IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO SAY I WOULDN'T HAVE MORE OF THIS AND IN THE CASE OF COFFEE OF COURSE IS CAFA IN ACTIVATING A WHOLL GROUP OF NOURTERASMITED SYSTEMS THAT GIVE YOU THAT THAT THAT HIGH ASSOCIATED WITH COFFEE SO YES THIS TA SISTEM IS CHANGEABLE IT'S VALIABLE AND IS SUBJECTED TO LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE BUT I LIKE THE FACTORY SYSTEM IS RESTRICTED E IN WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH IT BECAUSE IT'S GO IS TO ALLOW YOU TO GET NEUTRANCS ANS REVIVE THE GO OF THE OFACTORO SISTEM IS VERY DIFFERENT IS BEING USED NOT IN OUR CASE BUT IN EVERY ANIMAL SPECIES TO IN A IDENTIFI FRIEND VERSOS F TO IDENTIFY MADTE TO IDENTIFY ECOLOGICAL NICIES THE WEN A BEING SO IT PLACE A VERY BROAD ROLL THAT THEN REQUIRES THAT IT BE SET AP ORGAN ICE AND FUNCTION IN A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF CONTIC TASTE IS ABOWED CAN WE GET E NEUTERANCE WE NEED TO REVIVE AND CAN WE INSURE THAT WE ATTRACTED TO THE ONES WE MEET AND WE AVERSE WIT THE ONES WHE ARE GOING TO KEEL US I'VE BEEN OVERLUSING PLECELY CON REDUCTIONES BUT I THINKEG ILLUSTRATES YUSH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TOOL KEEMO SENSERIES I I DON'THINK OFE BEEN A RELY SIMPLICIT I THINK IT IT ILLUSTRATES THA THE KEY ANTRACTABLE NATURE OF THIS SYSTEM IN THE WAY YOU'VE APPROACHED IT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE EVERYBODY AS WE ARE MYSTIFIED WITH EMPATHY IN LOVE ET CETERA SO IN A FAIRNESS TO THAT I'M GOING TO ASK O A SORT OF A HI LEVEL QUESTIONER ABSTRACT QUESTION THIS WAS BASED ON A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH A FORMER GIRL FRIEND WERE WE TALKING ABOUT CHEMISTRY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS YI VERY COMPLICATED TOPIC ON THE ONE HND BUT ON THE OTHER HAND QUITE SIMPLE IN THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE FOR WHATEVER REASON EVOKE A TREMENDOUS SENSE OF AROUSAL FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE ONE WOULD HOPE AT LEAST FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME IED YOU DIDN'T NOW IT THESE WAS THAT KIND OF A POTHCU NO WO THE REASON I HO BUT THIS AS TO DO WITH TASTE BECAUSE SHE SAID SOMETHING I THINK IN PART TO A MAYBE IRRITATE ME A BIT BUT BUT WE WERE COMMENTING NOT ABOUT OUR OWN EXPERIENCE OF EACH OTHER BUT OF SOME ONE THAT SHE WAS NOW VERY EXCITED ABOUT WERE ON GOOD TERMS AH AND SHE SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THIS THING OF CHEMISTRY SUMEBE SHE WAS TRYING TO YOU KNOW WARRNED YOU TO O T COMING WARN ME WOUT'S COME AND SHE SAID I HAVE A FEELING SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS IN SMELL AND SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS ACTUALLY IN TASTE LITERALLY THE TASTE OF SOMEBODY'S BREATH THAT'S THE WAY SHE DESCRIBED IT AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING EXAMPLE  NUMBER OF REASONS BUT IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE IT GETS TO THE MERGING OF ODOR AND TASTE BUT ALSO TO THE IDEA THAT OF COURSE THE CONTEXT OF A NEW RELATIONSHIP O'M ASSUMING AND IN FACT THERE BOTH ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE ET CETERA THERS WHOLL CONTECT THERE BUT I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ODOR OF SOMEBODY'S BREATH BEING AVERSIVE NOT BECAUSE I COULD IDENTIFY IT AS AVERSIVE BECAUSE SE ISTIN'T LIKE LIKE BECAUSE IT JUST DIDDNT LIKE IT EBET BET THAT BUT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ASSOCIATED WE'D ATI OTHERS THAT TREAGER THAT NAY ATE YOU NO AVERSIV REACTION BY THE WAY ABSOLUTEY THERE ARE CERTAIN ORFALNS TO ME THAT A REVERSI YOU GOT IT AND THERE THERE ARE OTHER SENSE IN A A CAN RECALL SENSE OF OF SKIN OF FOODS ET CETERA THAT ARE IMIMMENSELY APPETITIVE SO I I'VE EXPERIENCED BOTH SIDES OF THIS ACQUASION MYSELF AND SHE WAS DESCRIBING THIS AND TO ME MORE THAN TASTING WINE WHICH IS THE TYPICALE EXAMPLE WERE PEOPLE INHALE IT AND THEN THEY DRINK IT TO MEAHE SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT MORE PEOPLE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RELATE TO THAT CERTAIN THINGS AND PEOPLE SMELL DELICIOUS EVEN MOTHERS DESCRIBING THE SMELL OF THEIR BABIES HE WER  A MATHER O AS A A ME AN AL TE AT OUR OWN BABIES OF WELISIN THEIR NEXT THAT'S THE MAGIC O PLACE ASAT THE BACK OF THEIR NECK ERYE ON MY GOODNESS I HAVE A GRANDCHILD NOW SO I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT REAL THAS HIS NAME SMELLS LIKE O CAT SO MORE BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES ALWAY MORE FUNDIFLY AT THE BEAUTIFUL POSIBLY A ALEDITOF EXAMPLES THE SMELL OF THE BACK OF YOUR GRANDSON'S NECK YES AND YOU COULDN'T YOU COULD GET MORE POSETAN AN O OMOSO WHAT IS GOING ON IN TERMS OF THE COMMINATION OF ODER AND TASTE GIVEN THAT THESE TWO SYSTEMS ARE SO DIFFERENT YES AND AND THEY COME TOGETHER ULTIMATELY THERE IS A PLACE IN THE BRAIN WERE THEY COME TOGETHER TO INTHE GRATE THE TWO INTO WHAT WE WOULD CALL YE KNOW THAT CENSURY EXPERIENCE AND I'LL TELL YO AN EXPERMENT THAN YOU COULD DO THAT THEM ON STRACE THES ITHIN IIN IN A THING IS GOOD FOR THE IN A FORTS OR FOR THE AUDIENCE HERE TO GET A SENSE OF HOW WE APPROACH IS PROBLEMS SO THAT WE CAN GET IN A MEANING FUL SCIENTIFIC ANSERS SO WE KNOW WERE THE UL FACTORY CORTICS IS IN THE BRAIN WE KNOW WHERE THE TASTE CORTIC IS IN THE BRAIN THERE INTO DIFFERENT PLACES WE CAN GO TO EACH OF THES TO CORTISES PULD COLOER TRACES WE PUT GREEN IN ONE WE PUT RED IN THE ADIT AND WE SEE WERE THE COLORS GO TO THAT A REFLECTION A WORD OFS NURANS AR PROJECTION A PROJECTING TO INTO THEIR NEXT TARGETS ONCE THEY GET THE SIGNAL WORD TO THEY SEND THE SIGNAL TO AND THEN WE REACH ON THAT THE ODER AND TASTE COME TO GET A SOMEWERE IN THE BRAIN WE SHOULD FIND AN AREA THAT NOW IT'S GETTING RED AND GREEN COLOR AND WE FOUND SUCH AN AREA AND NEXT WE ANTICIPATED WE POTESIZE THAT MAYBE THIS IS THE AREA IN THE BRAIN OF THE MOUSE CORRESPONDING ARY IN THE BRAIN OF HUMANS THAT INTHE GRATES OTHER AND TASTE IT'S KNOWN THIS DETERMI NORMARLY USEIS MOLTY SENSORY INTO GRASION AND IF THIS IS TRUE WE COULD DO THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT WE CAN TRAIN A MOUSE TO  LIT SWEET AND IF THEY GUESS CORRECTLY THAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SWEET THEY SHOULD GO NOW TO THE RIGHT PORT TO THE RIGHT SIDE TO GET A WATER REWARD IF THEY GO TO THE LIFT WHEN THE WAS SWEET THEN THEYRE INCORRECT AND THEY GET NO REWARD AND THEY ACTUALLY GET A TIME OUT NOW THI MISE ARE THIRSTIES OF THEIR VERY MULTIVATED TO PERFORM AND IF YOU REPEAT THIS TASK A HUNDRED TIMES A HUNDRED TRIALS INCREDIBLY NOW THIS ANIMAL LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE SWEET AND EXECUTE THE RIGHT ACTION AND BY THEIR ACTION WE NOW ARE BEING TOLD WHAT THAT ANIMAL IS TASTING WE CAN MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING AF WE CAN GIVEEM SWEET AND BITTER AND SAY E SWEETCOAT TO THE RIGHT AND IS BITTER GO TO THE LIFT AND AFTER YOU TRAIN IM THIS MISE WITH NINETY PERCENT ACCURACY WOLL TELL YOU WHEN YOU RUNDONISE NOW THE STIMULI WHAT WAS SREET AND WHAT WAS BITTER LRGH WE CAN NOW DO THE SAME EXPERIMENT BUT NOW MEEKS TASTE WITH ORDER AND SAY IF YOU GAT OTHER ALONE GO TO THE RIGHT OR PUSH THISE LIVER IN MICE IF YOU GET TASTE ALONE GO TO THIS OTHER PART OR PUSH THIS ATE LIVER AND IF YOU GET IT TWO TOGETHER DO THS SOMETHING ELSE AND IF YOU TRAIN THE MISE THE MISE ARE ABLE NOW TO REPOUR BACK TO YOU WHEN IS SENSING TASTE ALONE OTHER ALONE OR THE MEEKS MEXCENSE EXCEE NOW WE CAN GO TO THE BRAIN OF THESE MICE AND GO TO THES ARIAD THAT WE NOW AND COVER THISCOVER AS BEING THE SIDE OF MOULTY CENSURY INTEGRATION BETWEEN TASTE AND ORDER AND SILENCE IT PREVENT IT FROM BEING ACTIVATED EXPERIMENTALLY AND IF THAT ERE WE REALLY REPRESENT IT THE INTEGRATION OF THIS TOO THE ANIMALS SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE TASTE ALONE THE STILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE ORDER ALONE BUT SHOU BE INTAPABLE NOW TO RECOGNISE THE MEEKS AND EXACTLY AS PREDICTED THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET ALRIGHT THE BRAIN IS BASICALLY A SERIES OF ENGINEER CIRCUITS COMPLEX YOU GAT AND OUR TASK I SEE NOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WEK SCRABE YOU KNOW THISE AMAZING ARCHI TEXTURE OF THESE CIRCUITS IN A WAY THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO UNCOVER THE MEESTERIES I KNW OF THE BRAIN AND WHY CERTAIN PEOPLE'S BREATH TASTES SO GOOD ANOTHER PE EXACTLY NOT SO GOOD SO I NEVER ANSWER THAT BUT I TOLD YOU HOW WE CAN FIGURE A WEREIN THE BRAIN IS HAPPENING AS WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS DISCUSSION I THOUGHT A FEW TIMES ABOUT SIMILARITIES TO THE VISUAL SYSTEM OR DIFFERENCES TO THE VISUAL SYSTEM VISUAL SYSTEM THEIR COUPLE OF PHENOMENON THAT I WONDER IF THEY ALSO EXIST IN THE TASTE SYSTEM INTHE VISUAL SYSTEM WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LONG ENOUGH AND ACTIVATE THE GIVEN RECEPTORS LONG ENOUGH THAT OBJECT WILL ACTUALLY DISAPPEAR WE OFFSET THIS WITH LITTLE MICHOIVE MOVMENTS ET CETERA BUT THE PRINCIPLE IS AF FUNDAMENTAL ONES HABITUATION OR DESSENSENSATION EVERYONE SEEMS TO CALL IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT YOU GET THE IDEA OF COURSE IN THE TASTE SYSTEM I'M CERTAINLY FAMILIAR WITH EATING SOMETHING VERY VERY SWEET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME AND T FEEL TASTE VERY SWEET BUT A FEW MORE LICKS A FEW MORE BITES AND NOW IT TASTE NOT AS SWEET WITH ALL FACTION AND FAMILIAR WITH A ODOR IN A ROOM I DON'T LIKE OR I LIKE IN THAN IT DISAPPEARING SO SIMILAR PHENOMENON WHERE DOES THAT OCCUR AND CAN YOU IMAGINE A SORT OF A SYSTEM BY WHICH PEOPLE COULD LAVERAGE THAT BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN EATING NOT MORE SUGAR BUT LESS SUGAR I THINK WE HAD BETTER WAYS TO APPROACH THAT AND WE CAN TRANSITION FROM TASTE INTO THES ALE SIRCUITS THAT MAKES SUGAR SO EXTRAORDINARILY IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO CONSUME IMPOSSIBLE EXACTLY MORE IT SO WERE IT THAS THES THES THE SINCYTIE SEEN HAPPENS THAT'S HE TERM THAT WE USEI AND IT'S I THINK IT HAPPENING TAT MULTIPLE STATIONS IT'S HAPPENING AT THE RECEPTURE LEVEL I E THE SELTIN YOUR TONGUE THAT EIR SENSING TA SUGAR AS YOU ACTIVATE THESE RECEPTR AND THES TRIGURIN ACTIVELITY AFTERACTIVELITY OF TERACTIVITY EVENTUALLY OUEXSAUCE TO RECEPTRAGIN AND USING TERMS WHICH ARE EXTRAORDINARILY LOOSE I BUT FOR SICULOUS DISCOVERIES SAKE OF TES THE DISCASSH OF THE RECEPTURE ITS TO A POINT WERE YE UNDERGOES A SATE OF CHANGES CEMICAL CHANGES WERE IT NOW SIGNAS FAR LESS EFFICIENTLY OR E EVEN GETS REMOVED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE CELL AND NOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUGAR WILL TRIGOU FAR LESS OF OUR RESPONSE ND THAT IS A HUGE SIDE OF THE MODULATION AND THEN THE NEXT I BELIEVE ES THE INTEGRATED AGAIN LOSS OF SIGNALIN THAT HAPPENS BY CONTINUOUS ACTIVATION OF THE CIRCUIT AT EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT NERAL STATIONS IN OTHERIS FROM THE TONGUE TO THE GANGLI FROM THE GANGLIA TO THE FIRST STATION IN THE BRAINS TEM A SICONSTATION IN THE BRAINS TEM TO THE THALAMOS THAN TO THE CORTICS SO THEARE MULTIPLE STEPS TAT THES SIGNALLY STRAGVELLING NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WHY THESE E ALAVAL LINE WHY DID YOU NEED TO HAVE SO MANY STATIONS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE TASTE SYSTEM IS SO IMPORTANT TO AND SURER THAT YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED TO SURVIVE THAT IT HAS TO BE SUBJECTED TO MODULATION BY THE INTERNAL STATE AND EACH OF THIS NOD PROVIDES A NEW SITE TO GIVE IT PLASTICITY AND MODULATION NOT NECESSARILY TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT SOMETHING TASTES BUT TONSURE THAT YOU CONSUME MORE OR LEST OF DIFFER OR DIFFERENTLY OF WHAT YOU NEED AND WHEN I GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF OF HOW THE INTERNAL SATE CHANGES THE WAY THE TASTE SYSTEM WORKS SALT IS VERY APPETITIVE AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE NEED IT IT'S OUR ELECTRALIBALANCE REQUIRES SOL EVERY ONE OF THER NURALS USE TES SLT AS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE IONS YOU KNOW WHAT POTASTIUM TO INSURE THAT YOU CAN TRANSFER THIS ELECTRICAL SIGNALS WITHIN A BETWEEN ROM BUT THAT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS THE SAY OCEAN WATER IS INCREDIBLY AVERSIVE AND WE ALL NOW THIS BECAUSE WE GONE TO THE OCEAN AND THEN WHEN YOU GET IN YOUR MOUTH IT'S NOT THAT GRATE HOWEVER IF I SOLD TEPRIVE YOU AND WE CAN DO THIS IN IN EXPERIMENTAL MODELS BY READILY I NOW THIS INCREDIBLY HIGH CONCENTRATION OF SALT ONE MOLAR SODIMGLOY BECOMES AMAZINGLY A PITIT IVEN ATTRACTIVE WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE YOUR TOL IS TELLING YOU THIS IS HORRIBLE BUT YOUR BRAIN IS TELLING YOU I DON CARE YOU NEED IT AND THIS IS WHAT WE CALLE THE MODULATION OF THE TASE SYSTEM BY THE INTERNAL STATE PRESUME LY IF ONE IS HUNGRY ENOUGH EVEN ONY WHAT TASE COOD JUST GET YOU LENNALY WIDT ON THE MONEY NONE OF THIS IS EXACTLY COR OR IF YOUR THIRSTY AND HANGRY YOU SUPPRESS HANGER SO THAT YOU DON'T WASTE WATERMOLICULES INDIGESTING FOOD WHY BECAUSE IF YOUR THIRSTY AND YOU HAVE NO WATER YOU WILL DIE WITHIN A WEEK OR SO BUT YOU CAN GOING A HANGRY STRIKE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE WATERED FOR MONTHS BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO EAT AP OLD YOUR ENERGY RESERVES WATER IS A DIFFERENT STORY SO YOU COULD SEE OR O OR THAT THAT H THEY ARE MULTIBLE LAYERS AT WHICH THE TASTE SYSTEM THAT GUIDES YOU KNOW OUR DRIVE AND OUR MODIVATION TO CONSUME THE NUTRIANS WE NEED HAS TO BE MODULATED IN RESPONSE TO THE INTERNAL STATE ND OF COURSE INTERNAL SALE ITSELF AS TO BE MODULATED BY THEXCER IN A WORLD I AND SO THAT I THINKS A REASON WHY WHAT COULD OTHERWISE WE HAVE BEEN AN INCREDIBLY SIMPLE SISTEM FROM TETONG TO THE QORTIXING ONE YES WHIRE IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO INSURE TAT HE KNOW EACH STAPE YOU GIVE THE SISTEM THET LIVELL OFLIXILILITY WERE WERE WE COLLING NUR SCIENCE BLESTISIT THINK WE'RE HEADED INTO THE GOT BUT I HAVE A QUESTION THAT HAS JUST BEEN ON MY MIND FOR A BIT NOW BECAUSE I WAS DRINKING THIS WATER AND IT HAS ESSENTIALLY NO TASTE YES IS THERE ANY KIND OF SIGNAL FOR THE ABSENCE OF TASTE DESPITE HAVING SOMETHING IN THE MOUTH AND HERE IS WHY I ASK WHET I'M THINKING ABOUT IS SALIVA AND WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT IF I EAT A LOT OF VERY HIGHLY PALITABLE FOODS THAT DOES CHANGE HOW I EXPERIENCE MORE BLAND FOODS I MUST CONFESS WHEN I EAT A LOT OF THESE HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THEM I TEND TO CRAVE HEALTHIER FOODS BUT THAT'S PROBABLY FOR CONTEXTERAL REASONS ABOUT NEUTREENS ET CETERA BUT I COULD IMAGINE AN EXPERIMENT WHERE I'S THERE A TASTE OF NO TASTE RIIS THEIR TASTE OF NO TASTE BECAUSE IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM THERE IS I YOU CLOSE THE EYES AND YOU START GETTING INCREASES IN ACTIVITY INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM AS SOPPOSED TO DECREASES WHICH OFTEN SURPRISES PEOPLE BUT THE REASONS FOR THAT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SIGNAL TO NOISE SIGNAL TO BACKGROUND AND IN ES A GOOD QUESTION I CAN SELL YOU THAT MOST OF OUR WORK IS TRYING TO FOCUS ON HOW THE TASTISEM WORKS NOT HOW IT DOESN'T WORK BOT LET EME  THAT EEN HE IT I KNOWYU ANYN LIFOL AND I KNEW WHEN IN VITING Y ADI OU SETTING MYSELF   A ON AN ON A ON A DIFFEREN WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN THING I O HOWEVER O I LISTEN I I WAS MEAN ING THIS IS ASETEM MOTHE AND I'LL SAY IT HERE FOR THE SECOND  ASH I RECORDED A ODCAST RECENTLY WITH A VERY PROMINENT PODCAST IT LEX FREEDMENT PIGAS AND I MADE REFERENCE TO THE SO CALLED NEW YORK NORO SCIENCE MAFIA I WON'T SAY WHETHER NOT WE ARE SITTING IN THE PRESENCE OF NEW YORK NERO SCIENCE MAFIA MEMBER THAT  IN ANY EVENT I I KNOW THE SORTS OF RIBING IN THE THIN PRIV THOSE LESTENING THIS IS THE KIND OF HAZING THAT HAPPENS BENEVOLENT HAZING A IN ACADAMIA  I TE TARA OF COURSE IT'S IT'S IF IT'S A SIGN O LI ISA I IN A TELL ME THAT I ATS ALWAYS ABOUT THI SCIENCE IN TH RI IM BUT  BUT A TA THING TEREST IN QUESTION LOK I IM I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER AND AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I WOULD EXPLORE IT IN A WAY THAT YOU WULD RIGOROUSLY TEACH ME E BUT IM U YOU LET ME TELL YE WI AM ASKIIS AND THAN A'LL OFFER AN EXPERIMENT YES THAT I'D LOVE TO SEE SIMEONE AGRS N A TO ATHING ABOUT SALIVA YES WICH IT'S NO KNOT NOT BUT THAT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN FIGURE IT OT LESTLY BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE SALIVA IN A FED STATE IS DISTINCT FROM THE SALIVA IN AN UNFED STATE SUCH THAT IT MOGUWA ITS NO THE SENSICUN THAT I ER SIRMEN HAS BEEN DONE NO HAS BEEN DONE YOU AND SO THE ANSWER IS NOW IT'S NOY AND YOU I AND THE WAY YOU COULD DO T H EXPERIMENT IS BECAUSE WE USE HERTIFICIAL SALIVA TS O AKNOTHERS A NOT OF TEARS  AANON O WE I DON'T MEAN THAT YOU GOT TO WULGERINGS THAT YOU I A YE WING MY LAVORATORING WE KNOW THE COMPOSITION OF SALIVA AND SO YOU CAN MAKE SUCH A THING AND AND AND AND YOU CAN TAKE IN A TASTE SOLSING CULTURE OR IN A TONG WHERE YOU WASH IT OUT OF AND THEN YOU CAN APPLY ARTIFICIALS ALIVA AND WHAT HAPPENS IS A DESISTEN MES BEING INGINEER TO THE SENSITIES TO BE CAM I A  AGNOSTATE FOR SALIVA TO BECOME INVISIBLE E AND THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE ON THE STATE OF THE ANIMAL WHAT 'S THE REASON THAT YOU EXPERIMENTA ABSOLUS A I DOESN'T TEFEET ANY GRAND HAVI OTICIS AN NE I A PURE CURIOSITY SO YOU KNOW THAT CURIOSITY KILL TE CANTE I DO BUT TOIVS O THE CAREER OF A SIN AVRSINGL AS ORIVES AS AV  AVRYSING E THOY OF OUR LIVES EXACTLY O CERR SO IF IT'S NOT SALIVA AND APPARENTLY IT IS NOT A WHAT ABOUT INTERNAL STATE AND WHAT ASPECTS OF THIS THE INTERNAL MILL YOU ARE RELEVANT BECAUSE THERE'S AUTONOMIC THERE'S A SLEEP AND AWAY THER SUTRAS O ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I I GOT UP FROM HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHEN I SOLICILY QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE THIS EPISODE WAS WHY DO I CRAVE SUGAR WHEN I'M STRASSED FOR INSTANCE AN NAT CO BE CONTECTUAL BUT WHAT AR THE BASICAUS IT MAKES US FEEL GOOD BY THE WAY WILL GET TO THAT IT'S YOU AD TITS ANSWER SOTED I ACTIVEADS E WHAT AM WILLING TO GENERYCALLY REFERRED TO AS WE WARD PLECRSENTERES IN A WAY THAT I DRAMATICALLY E IT CHANGES OUR INTERNAL STATE THIS ISING NA WHY DO WE TA GALO ICE CREEM WHEN WERE VERY DEPRESS IN FACT THIS IS A GOOD SALWAY TO GOINTO THE INTO INTO THIS EENTIREY DIFFERENT WORLD E E OF OF THE BODY TELLING YOUR BRAIN WHAT YOU NEED IN I IN IN IN IN IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE SUGAR IN FACT E O GET A ANY WAYS GOING YOU WARE GOING TO US SOMETHING WELL NOW I I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THE MOST BASIC ELEMENTS OF INTERNAL STATE IN PARTICULAR THE ONES THAT ARE BELOW OUR CONSCIOUS DETACTION AND THIS IS A A OF COURSE IS I SAGUAY INTO THIS INCREDIBLE LANDSCAPE WHICH IS THE GUT BRAIN ACCESS WHICH I THEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WAS ALMOST A MAYBE IT WAS A AN ARY THE HOISTERS AT AT MEETING AND AN NOW BELIEVE YOU YOU AND OTHERS THERE COMPANYIS THER HAVE COMPANIES THERE ARE ON ACTIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMMS THERES ON AND BEAUTIFUL WORK O MANY TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THAT WORK THAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED AND AND A LOT OF THE LISTENERS OF THIS POCKETS WILL HAVE HEARD OF THE GOTBRAIN ACCESS AND THERRE A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE GOTBRAIN ACES MANY PEOPLE THINGS THAT THIS MEANS THAT WE THINK WITH OUR STOMACH BECAUSE OF THE COT AN COGOT FEELING ASPECT BUT A LOFF YOU TO TALK ABOUT THE ASPECTS OF GOT BRING SIGNALLING THAT DRIVE OUR CHANGE OUR PERCEPTIONS AND BEHAVIORS THAT ARE COMPLETELY BENEATH OUR WAR YES EXCELLENT SO LET ME BEGIN MAY BE BY BY STATING THAT INO THE BRAIN NEEDS TO MONEY TOUR THE STATE OF EVERY ONE OF OUR ORGANS ORGANS IT HAS TO DO IT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT THE BRAIN CANIN SURE THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE ORGANS ARE WORKING TO GIT IT IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE HEALTHY PHYSIOLOGE NOW THIS MONEY TURING OF THE BRAIN IS BEE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME BUT I THINK WHAT HAN'T BEEN FULLY APPRECIATED THAT THIS IS A TWO WAY HIGHWAY WERE THE BRAIN IS NOT ONLY MONEY TO RIN BUT IS NOW MOD LAYIN BACK WHUT THE BODY NEEDS TO DO AND THAT INCLUDES ALL THE WAY FROM MONEY TURING THE FREQUENCY OF HARD BEATS AND THE WAY THAT INSPIRATION AND ASPIRATIONS IN THE BREADING PCYCHLE OPERATE TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INJEST SUGAR AND FAT NOW LET ME  GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE AGIN OF OF AM OF HOW THE BRAIN CAN TATE WHAT WE WOULD REFER TO CONTEXTUAL ASSOCIATIONS AND TRANSFORMANG INTO INCREDIBLE CHANGES IN PHYSIOLOGY AND METAVOLISM IN REMEMBER PAVLO SO PAVLOV IN THIS CLASSICAL EXPERIMENTS IN CONDITIONIN YOU KNOW ASSOCIATED CONDITION IN YE WOULD TAKE A BELL IT WILL RING THE BELL EVERY TIME IT WAS GOING TO FEED THE DOG AND EVENTUALLY THE DOG LEARN TO ASSOCIATE THE RINGING OF THE BELL WITH FOOT COMING NOW THE FIRST INCREDIBLE FINDING I MADE IT IS THE FACT THAT THE DOG NOW IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BELL ALONE WILL STAR TO SALUBATE AND WE WILL CALL THAT I O NEUROLOGICALLY SPEAKING AN ANTICIPATORY RESPONSE O CA I COULD UNDERSTAND IT I GET IT IN OW NERS IN THE BRAIN THAT FORM TAT AS SO IATION NOW REPRESENT FOODIS COMING AND THER SENDING A SIGNO TO MORE ENURANCE TO GO INTO YOUR SALIVARY GLANCE TO SQUIZE THEM SO YOU RELEASE I NOW IN NOW SALIVA BECAUSE YOU NOFULLIS COMING BUT WHAT'S IVEN MORE REMARKABLE IS THAT THOSE ANIMALS ARE ALSO RELEASING INSULING IN RESPONSE TO A BALL OGI THIS ILLUSTRATE ONE PART OF THIS TWO WAY HIGHWAY THE HIGHWAY GOING DOWN SOMEHOW THE BRAIN CREATE THIS ASSOCIATIONS THAN THEIR NURANS IN YOUR BRAIN NOW THAT NO FOOD IS COMING AND SEND A SIGNA SOMEHOW AL TAWAY DOWN TO YOUR PANCRESS THET NOW IT SAYS RELEASE INSULIN BECAUSE SUGAR IS COMING DOWN  THIS COSPACK TO THE MAGIC OF THE BRAINI IS TAT NEVER ENDING SORTS OF BOTJOY AND INTRIGU HOW THE HEL DO THEY DOTIS OIT I MEAN THE NURANSIT I SARE I SHARAR TA LI AN FASTINATON THERE'S ANOTHER DAY OR A LECTURE OR A SOME TALKS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS OR TALHT WHERE I DON'T SIT BACK AND JUST THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY INO YENARIN SO ME NOW NOW OVER THE PAST IIN A DOZEN YEARS I AND WITH GREAT FORCE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS NOW THE MAIN HIGHWAY THAT IS COMMUNICATING THE STATE OF THE BODY WITH THE BRAIN  AS BEIN AND COVER AS BEIN WHAT WE NOW REFERRED TO US THE GAT BRAIN ACCESS AND THE HIGHWAY IS A SPECIFIC BANDLE OF NERVES I NOW WICH IT MAY ERSE FROM THE VEGA GANGLIA THE NOTOS GANGLIA AND SO IS THE VAGUEST NERVE THAT IT'S INERVATING THE MAJORITY OF THE ORGANS IN YOUR BODY IT'S MONY TORING THEIR FUNCTION SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN AND NOW THE BRAIN GOING BACK DOWN AND SAYING THIS IS GOING AL RIGHT DO THIS OF THIS IS NOT GOING SO WELL DO THAT AND AND I SHOULD POINT OUT AS YOU WELL KNOW EVERY ORGAN SPRIN ANCHERAS E ON MAST THE ALL MAST BE MONITOR ATHEIN FAT IN I NOW I HAVE NO DOUT THAT THESEASES THAT WE ABDORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH METAVOLISN PHYSIOLOGY AND EVEN IMMUNITY ARE LIKELY TO EMERGE AS THISEASES CONDITIONS STATES OF THE BRAIN I DON'T IN OBISITY IS A THE CEASE OF METAVOLISM I BELIEVE OBISITY IS A THE CEASE OF BRAIN CIRCUITS I DO AS WELL YET AND AND AND SO AND SO THIS THIS THISV EU THAT WE HAVE I NOW BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE LONGEST TIME BECAUSE IN  THE MOLITUES THAT WERE DEALING WIT ARE IN THE BODY NODDING THE HEAD IN A LATES TUTINO TO VIEW OF COURSE THIS ISSUES AND PROBLEMS AS BEING ONE OF METAVOLISN PHYSIOLOGY AND SO FOR THEY REMAIN TO BE THE CARRIERS OF THE ULTIMATE SIGNAL BUT THE BRAIN ULTIMATELY APPEARS TO BE THE CONDUCTOR OF THES ORCHISTRA OF PHISIOLOGIAN MITAVOLIES R NO THIT'S GO TO THE GAD BRAIN AND SUGER MAY PES IS I AM IN THE THE THE VAGUEST NERVE HAS A IN POPULAR CULTURE HAS BEEN UN KIND OF CONVERTED INTO THIS SINLE MEANING OF COMMING PATH WAYS MOSTLY BECAUSE ASHE HAVE TO TIP MY HAT TO THE YOGIC COMMUNITY WAS AMONG THE FIRS TO TALK ABOUT VAGUES ON AND ON AND ON ITHERE ARE COMMING PATHWAYS AO YOU KNOW SO CALLED PARI SYMPATHETIC PATHWAYS WITHIN THE VAGS BUT I THINK THAT THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT THE VAGUES THE MORE IT SEEMS LIKE AN ENTIRE AMSET OF NERAL CONNECTIONS AS THA BUS TO ONE NERVE A JUST WANTED TO JUST MENTIONTHAT BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE VAGUEST TURNS OUT EXPERIMENTALLY IN THE LABORATORY MANY NERL SCIENTISTS WILL STIMULATE THE VAGUEST TO CREATE STATES OF ALERTNESS AND AROUSAL WHEN ANIMALS OR EVEN PEOPLE BELIEVE IT OR NOT ARE CLOSE TO DYING OR GOING INTO COMA STIMULATION OF THE VAGUEST AS ONE OF THE WAYS TO WAKE UP THE BRAIN COUNTER TO THE IDEA THAT IT'S JUST THE SI WAY OF COMMING ONESELF TEW AND ALSO OF COURSE A ME WHAT ONE HAS TO BE CAUTIOUS THEIR IN THAT SO THE THE DHE DE BAGEST NERVE IS MADE OUT OF MANY THOUSANDS OF FIVERS IN A INDIVIDUAL FIVERS THAT MAKE THES GIGANTIC BANDLE AND IT'S LIGHTLY AS WORDS SPEAKING THET EACH OF THESE FIVERS CARRIES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MEANING THENONE NECESSARY ONE BY ONE MAY BE FIVE FIVE OR TEN FIVE ORS TWENTY TO THEOIN BUT THEY CARRY MEANING THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR SPECIFIC TASK THIS CRUPLE FIVERS IS TELLING THE BRAIN ABOUT THE STATE OF YOUR HEART THI CRUPLE FVER IS STILLING THE BRAIN OBOUT THE STATE OF YOUR GOT THIS IS TELING YOUR BRIN ABOUT ITS NUTRITIONAL STATE THIS YOUR PANGUIES THIS YOUR LANS AND THEY ARE AGAIN TO MAKE THE SAME SIMPLE EXAMPLE THE KEYS OF THE SPIANAL YES YOUR RIGHT THERE IS A A LOD OF TADA Y SHOWING THAT ACTIVATING THE ENTIRE VAGA BANDLE HAS VERY M ANING FOR EFFICTING A WIDE RANGE OF CONDITIONS IN FACT IT'S BEING USED TO TREAT UNTRACTABLE DEPRSSION THOUGH STIMULATOR EPILEPTIC SISSURES BUT AGAIN THEARE THOUSANDS OF FIVERS CARRYING DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS SO TO SOME DEGREE IN A THIS IS LIKE TURNING THEY LIES ON THE STADIUM BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ILLOMINATE WERE YOU LOST YOUR KEAS UNDER YOUR SEET YET TEN THOUSAND BOLLS OF A THOUSAND WATS EACH AV YJUST COME ON ONLY ONE OF THESE ISE POINTING TO WORE AND SO AM LIKE ENOUGH THAT ONE OF THEM HAPPEND TO POINT TO MY SIHT SO HERE YOU ACCULATE THE BANDLE THOUSANDS OF FIVERS 'M LIKE ENOUGH THAT SOME OF THOS HAPPEN TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE A MEANING FOR DIFFERENCE IN DEPRESSION OR TO MAKE A MEANING FOR DIFFERENCE IN THEPOLIPIVS BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE MESCON TRUE AS ARGUING THAT THIS BROAD ACTIVATION AS ANY TYPE OF SELECTILITY OR SPECIFICITY WHERE YES LACKY ENOUGH THAT AMONG ALL THE THINGS ARE BEING TON SOME OF THOSE HAPPEN TO CHANGE THE BIOLOGY OF THESE PROCESSES NOW THERE REASH ON THIS IS REALIVENT BECAUSE THE MAGIC OF THIS GAD BRAIN AXES IT'S THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THESE THOUSANDS OF FIVERS REALLY DOING DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AN OUR GOLL AND ALONG WITH MANY A THE GREAT IU NOW SCIENCES I INCLUDING STEEP LIVERLESS THAT STARTED A LOT OF IN O THIS MOLICULAR DESECTION ON THIS TEGUE ALL GAT BRAIN COMMUNICATION LINE AT HARVOR IT'S TRYING TO UNCOVER WHAT THERE EACH OF THOSE LINES DOING WHAT ARE EACH OF THOS KEYS OF THESE PIANO PLAIN WHAT'S THE LATUS THERE JUST AS A BRIEF UPTAT I NO SEEVINGLY RELEASE AM I THING I WAS THERE WHEN HE GOT IS HOWARD HERS AND I DID NOT SALOW USA ON ALWAYS GREADE  TO GET BE BY EXCELLENT AND O FIRST OF HL I'M HAPPY YOU DIDEM BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU CAN FOCUS ON THIS AMAZING FOTCASTS I WUT I AAS VERY GRACIOUS OF YOU OM IT'S ALWAYS AF FEELS BETTER IT'S NOT GOOD TO GET BEED OUT BY EXCELLENT PEOPLE SEEEN SEEVES A IN IS I SECOND TOONE AND HE IS THE FINING AS YOU SAID THE MOLOCULAR OM CONSTITUENTS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THESE MANY MANY FIBERS IS THERE AN UPTAN THERE ARE THE FINDING MULTIBLE PARALLEL PATH WAS I THEY ARE THEY ARE SOMES THAT CONTROL HARD BE SOME THAT CONTROLL THE RESPIRATORY CYCL SOME THAT I BEING INVOLVED IN THE GAS TRIK MOVEMENT IN OT THIS NOTION THAT YOUR FOL AND YOU FEEL FULL IN PART BECAUSE YOUR GOD GETS DISTENDED YOUR STOMAC FOR EXAMPLE IT AND HIN THERE LITTLE CENSURS THAT A READING THAT AND TELLING THE BRAIN YOUR FOOL TT AS  E ASO WILL SOON CHANGE ON THE BASE AS F OF LABERLY IS ANOTHER WAY INNOCENCE ITHING WE ARE LEARNING ENOUGH ABOUT IS DIS DISLINES EH IT THAT COULD REALLY HELP PUT TO GET IT IS THIS HOLISTIC VIEW OF YOU KNOW HOW THE BRAIN IT'S TRULY CHANGING BOTE PHYSIOLOGY METAVOLISMAN IMMUNITY THE PART THAT HASN'T BEEN YET DEVELOPE AND THAT IT NEEDS A FAIR AMON OF WORD BUT IT'S AN EXCITING THRILLING YOU KNOW THE DURING OF DISCOVERY IS HOW THE SIGNAL COMES BACK TO NOW CHAIN  THAT BIOLOGY INOT EXAMPLE I GAVE YOU BEFORE WITH PAVLOV'S DOG EH LI I FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW THE ASSOCIATION CREATED TIS LING BETWEEN THE BELL BUT IN HOW DOS THE BRAINTAL THE PANCREOS TO RELEASE IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF INSRY BO CA SO TELL ME ICAMI LET ME TELL YOU IT ABOUT THE GAD BRAIN ACCES AND OUR INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR SUGAR AND FAT INSATIABLE FOR SUGAR UND CUENCHABLE FOR FAT AND THIS IS  STORY ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIKING AND WANTING LIKIN SUGAR IS THE FUNCTION OF THE TASTE SYSTEM AND IT'S NOT REALLY LIKING SUGAR IS LIKING SWEET ONTIN SUGAR OUR NEVER ENDIN APPETITE FOR SUGAR IS THE STORY OF THE GAD BRAIN ACCESS LIKING VERSES WANTING AND THIS WORK IS WORK OF OF MY OWN LAVORATORY KNOW THAT BEGAN LONG AGO WHEN WE DISCOVER THE SWEET RECEPTORS AND YOU CAN NOW INGINEER MISE THAT LACK TIS RECEPTORS SO INNOCENCE THIS ANIMALS WOULD BE UNABLE TO TASTE SWEET ALIFE WIOU SWEETNESS OW HORRIBLE AND IF YOU GIVE A NORMAL MOUSE A BOTTLE CONTAINING SWEET AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT ITHE SUGAR OR AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETNER I THEY BOTER SWEET THEY HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TASTES BUT THAT'S SIMPLY BE COST ARTIFICIAL SWEET NURSE HAVE SOME OFF TASTES BUT AS FAR AS THE SWEET RECEPTORYES CONCERN THEY BOTH ACTIVA THE SAME RECEPTORE TRIGER THE SAME SIGNAL AND IF YOU GIVE AN ANIMAL AN OPTION OF A BOTTLE CONTAINING SUGAR OR SWEETENER VERSUS WATER THIS ANIMAL WILL DRING TEN TO ONE FROM THE BOTTLE CONTAINING SWEET THAT'S THE TASTE SYSTEM IT AND WILL GO A SAMPLE ISH ONE LEGS A COUPLE OF LIGS AND IN TE A A THAT'S THE ONE I ONE BECAUSE I'S A PETITY AND BECAUSE I LOVE IT SO PREFERS SUGAR TO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENO NO NO NO NO NO WO TE SOSFER ISIS EXPERIMENT THIS EXPERIMENT AND WHEN I PUD ONLY SWEET IN ONE BOTTLE AND IT COULD BE EITHE SUGAR ORTIFICIAL SWEETER I THAT'S A MOTHER WISH ONE OR THEY WE'RE GOING TO DO THE NEXT EXPERMENT WERE WE SEPARATE OS TO FOR NOW I SWEET VERSUS WATER AND SWEET MEANS SWEET NOT SUGAR SWEET MEANS ANYTHING THAT TASTE SWEET O I AND SUGARS ON EXAMPLE AND SPLENDER IS ANOTHER EXUM ASPERTAIN MON FULATER O LAS THE ELY I YOULY OSEN MATTER YE A I THERE SAME THAT ONLY HUMANS CAN TASTE MICE CAN NOT TASTE BECAUSE THERE WE CEPTORES BETWEEN HUMANS AND MICE AR DIFFERENT BUT WE HAVE PUT THE HUMAN RECEPTOR INTO MCE WE INGINEER MICE AND WE COMPLETLE HUMAN ICE THIS MOUSE IS TASTE WORALL O I BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONVERSATION WE'RE ONLY COMPARING SWEET VERSUS WATER A NOPTION MY GOODNESS THER WILL LIK TO NO IN IN FROM THE SWEET SIDE TEN TO ONE AT LEAST VERSES THE WATER MAKE SENS OLI NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE MICE AND WE'RE GOING TO GENITICALLY INGINEAR IT TO REMOVE THE SWEET RECEPTORS SO THIS MICE NO LONGER HAVE IN THE ORAL CAVITY ANY SENSURS THAT CAN DETECT SWEETNESS BE THAT SUGAR MOLECULE BEAD AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER BITH ANYTHING ELSE O TAST SWEET AND IF YOU GIVE THIS MICE AN OPTION BETWEEN SWEET VERSUS WATER SUGAR VRSUS WATER ARTIFICIAL SONEVERSS WATER IT WELE DRINK EQUALLY WELL FROM BOTH BECAUSE HE CAN NOT TELL THEM APATT BECAUSE DOSN'T HAVE THE RECEPPROS FOR SWEET SO THAT SWEET BOTTLE TASTE YAS LIKE WATER MAKE SENS ISVERY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SPERIMENT WITH SUGAR FROM NOW ON THIS FOGUS AN SUGAR SO AN WEN A GIVE A MOUSE NOW SUGAR VERSUS WATER NORMAL MOUSE WILL DRINK FROM THE SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR VERY LITTLE FROM ER WATER NO COW THE SWEET RECEPTRES DE LIMINATIN MOUSE CAN NO LONGER TELL THEM APART AND IT WILL DRINK FROM BOTH BUT IF I KEEP THE MOUSE IN THAT CASE FOR THE NEX FORTY EIGHT HOURS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENS WHEN I CAM FORTY EIGHT HOURS LATER AND I SEE WHAT THE MOUSE IS LICKING OR DRINKING FROM THE MOUSE IS DRINKING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE SUGAR BOTTLE HOW COULD THIS BE IT CAN NOT TASTE IT THOES NAVES SWEET RECEPTORS DURING THUS FORTY IGHT HOURS THE MOUSE LEARN THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT BOTTLE THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD AND THAT IS THE BOTTLE I WANT TO CONSUME NOW HOW DOES THE MOUSE IDENTIFY THAT BOTTLE IT DOS SO BY USING ATERCENSORY FEATURES THES MELL OF THE BOTTLE THE TEXTURE OF THIT SOLUTION INSIDE SUGAR THE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS IS KIND OF GOOPY  THE SIDN IS IN WHICH THE BOTTLE IS IN THE CAGE IT DOSN'T MATTER ONE BUT THE MOUSE REALIZED THERE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT AND THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF OUR UNCONSCIABLE DESIRE AND OUR CRAVING FOR SUGAR AND IS MEDIATED BY THE GAT BRAIN ACCESS THE FIRST CRUE IS THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP IMMEDIATELY SUGGESTING A POST INGESTIVE EFFECT SO WE REASON IF THIS IS TRUE AND IS THE GAT BRAIN ACCES THATS DRIVING SUGAR PREFERENCE THEN THIS SHOULD BE A GROUP OF NURANS IN THE BRAIN THAT OUR RESPONDING TO POST INGESTIVE SUGAR AND LOWND BEHOLE WEIDENTIFY A GROUP OF NURSE IN THE BRAIN THAT THAS TIS AND THIS NURANS RECEIVE THEIR IMPUD THIRECTLY FROM THE GAT BRAIN ACCESS FROM OTHER NR YOU GADDED AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT SUGAR IS RECOGNIZE NORMALLY BY THE TONGE ACTIVATES AN APETY RESPONSE NOW YOU IN GESTED AND NOW YO ACTIVATES A SELECTIVE GROUP OF SELLS IN YOURINTESTINGS THAT NOW SEND A SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN BE A THE VEGAL GANGLEN THAT SIS I GAT WHAT I NEED THE TONGE THATSN'T NOW THAT YOU GAT WHAT YOU NEED IT ONLY KNOWS THAT YOU TASTED IT THES NOWS THAT YOU GAT TO THE POINT THAT IS GOING TO BE USED WHICH IS THE GAT AND NOW IS SENS THE SIGNAL TO NOU REIN FORCE THE CONSUMPTION OF THIS THING BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONE THAT I NEEDED SUGAR SOURCE OF ENERGY ANDIS AR THESE NERONS IN THE GOT SO THEY ARE DOT NURNS IN THE GOD FOR THISE ARE GAD SELLS THAT RECOGNIZE THE SUGAR MOLEGUASY SEND A SIGNAL AND THAT SIGNAL IS RECEIVE BY THE VAGUANURAN DIRECTLY GOT IT AND THE SENDS A SIGNAL THROUGH THE GAD BRAIN AXES TO THE SELL BODIES OF THIS NURANCS IN THE VAGUALGANGLIA AND FROM THERE TO THE BRAIN STEM TO NOW TREGURE THE PREFERENCE FOR SUGAR TO QUESTION IS ONE YOU MENTION THAT THESE SELLS THAT THETECT SUGAR WITHIN THE GOT ARE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE INTUSTIN YOU DIDN'T ESIS STOMACH YOU SURPRISE ME IRISING GOT AS STOMACH I DON'T NO OR NOW IN YO AS THEIR INTESTING BECAUSE THAT WERE ALL THA SORTION HAPPENS SO YOU WANT THE SIGNAL YOU SEE YOU WANT THE BRAIN TO KNOW THAT YOU HAD SUCCESSFUL INGESTION AND BREAK DOWN OF WHATEVER YOU CONSUME INTO THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE AND IN A BLUCOS AND MINOACATES FATI AND SO YOU WANT A MAKE SURE THAT ONCE THEY ARE IN THE FORM THAT INTESTINGS CAN NOW ABSORB THEM IS WHERE YOU GET THE SIGNAL BACK SAYING THIS WHAT I ONE OGE NOW LET ME US TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER AND THIS NOW SUGAR MOLICLES ACTIVATES THIS UNIQUE GOT BRAIN SIRCUIT THAT NOW DRIVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PREFERENCE FOR SUGAR NOW A KEY ELEMENT OF THIS CIRCUIT IS A THE SENSEREUS IN THE GAT THAT RECOGNIZE THE SUGAR DO NOT RECOGNIZE ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS AT ALL NOT BECAUSE THEIR NUTRIENT VALUE IS UNCOUPLED FROM THE TASTE GENERICALLY SPEAKING ONE CAN MAKE THAT BY THIS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF RECEPTORE AS TURNS OUT THAT S NOT THE TONGUE RECEPTORS BEING USE IN THE GOT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOLEGL THAT ONLY RECOGNIZS THE GLUCOSMOLEGUL NOT ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS THIS AS A PROFOUND IMPAT ONTHE EFFECT OF ULTIMATELY ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS IN CURVING OUR APPETITE OUR CRAVING OUR INSATIABLE DESIRE FOR SUGAR SINCE THEY DON'T ACTIVATE THE GAT BRAIN AXES THEY'LL NEVER SATISFY THE CRAVING FOR SUGAR LIKE SUGAR DAS AND THE RESON I BELIEVE THAT ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS HAVE FAILD IN THE MARKET TO CURVE OUR APPETITE OUR NEED OUR DESIRE FOR SUGAR IS BECAUSE THEY BEAUTIFULLY WORK ON E TONGU THE LIKINGE TO RECOF NICE SWEET VERSES NON SWEET BUT THE FELL TO ACTIVA THE GEYSENSERESTING THE GAT THAT NOW INFORM THE BRAIN YOU GOT SUGAR NO NEED TO CRAV ANY MORE SO THE THA THE ISSUE OF WANTING I CAN WE RELATE THAT TO A PARTICULAR SET OF NARROW CHEMICALS UPSTREAM O SO THE PATHWAY IS THE SO GLUECOS IS ACTIVATING THE CELLS IN THE GUT THAT THROUGH THE VAGUS THAT'S COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE PESEMLY THE NOTOS GANGLING AND UP INTO THE BRAINSTAND VERY GOOD AND FROM THEIR WORT AS IT GO AT WHERE IS IT GO AND WHAT IS THE SUBSTRATE OF WANTING I A YOU KNOW OF COURSE I THINK MOLECULES LIKE DOPENING CRAVING AS A BOOK EVEN CALL THE MOLECULE OF MORE ET CETERA ET CETERA DOPOME IS A VERY DIABOLICAL MOLECULE AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT EVOKES BOTH A SENSE OF PLEASURE ISH BUT ALSO A SENSE OF DESIRING MORE OF CRAVING SO UN IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS ARE AND I GREE ARE FAILING AS A MEANS TO SATISFY SUGAR CRAVING AT THE LEVEL OF NUTRIEN SENSING AND YET IF WE TRIGARE THIS TRUE SUGAR EVOKE WANTING PATHWAY TOO MUCH AND WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCES THAN WE EAT SUGAR AND WE FIND OURSELVES WANTING MORE AND MORE SUGAR NOW THAT COULD ALSO BE INSOLENT THIS REGULATION BUT A CAN WE UNCOUPLE THOSE YEAME LOOK IT WE HAVE A MAKE A PROBLEM WE OVER CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR AND THOUHT IN WE'RE FACING A UNIQUE TIME IN OUR EVOLUTION WERE THE SESIES OF MILE NUTRITION ARE DUE TO OVER NUTRITION I WE HOW NUTS IS THAT E I MEAN HISTORICALLY THE SESES OF MONNETRETIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LEAN TO AND THEIR NUTRITION AND SO WE NEED TO COME UP WITH STRATAGES THE CONVENIENFULLY CHANGE THE ACTIVATION OF THESE CIRCUITS THEIR CONTROL OUR WANTING CERTAINLY IN THE POPULATIONS AN RISK AND THE'S GOT BRAIN CIRCUIT THE ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW IT'S THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION THAT ARE INFORMING THE BRAIN THE PRESENCE OF INTESTING OF SUGAR IN THESE EXAMPLE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TARGEIT IN THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT I'S THEIR WAY THAT WE CAN MEANINGFULLY MODULATE THE CIRUITS SO I MAKE YOUR BR AIN THINK THAT YOU GOT SATISFY WITH SUGAR EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT GIVING YOU SUGAR SO THAT IMMEDIATELY RAS THE QUESTION ARE THE RECEPTORS FOR GLUCOS IN THESE GOT SELLS SUSCEPTIBLE TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HEALTHIER FOR US THAT'S VERY GOOD EXCELLENT IDEA AND I THINK AN IMPORTANT GOLD WULL BE TO COME UP WITH E STRATIGY AND IDINTIFI THOS VERY MEANS THAT ALLOW US TO MODULATY CIRCUITS IN A WAY THAT CERTAINLY FOR ALL OF THOSE WERE THESE ISE A BIGE SUE E CAN REALLY HAVE A IN A DRAMATIC IMPA IN IMPROVING I HUMAN HEALT I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THIS AND UNHAPPY TO BE WRONG I'M OFT AN WRONG ON AND TOLD I'M WRONG THAT WE HAVE SELLS WITHIN ARE GOT THE DON'CIOUS SENSE SUGAR GUCOS ICHTO BE SPECIFIC BUT ALSO SELLS WITHIN ARE GOT THET SENSIMINO ACIDS AND FATYACIDS I COULD IMAGINE A SONARYOWERE ONE COULD TRAIN THEMSELVES TO FEEL AND IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF SACIETY FROM THE CONSUMPTION OF FOODS THAT ARE RICH IN ESSENTIAL FADIACIDS A MENO ACIDS PERHAPS LESS COLORIC OR LESS OM INSOLEN DISREGULATING THEN SUGAR I'LL USE MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED SWEETS BUT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS FOR SOME REASON IV STARTED TO LOSE MY APPETITE FOR THEM PROBABLY BECAUSE I JUST DON'T EAT THEM ANY MORE AT FIRST THAT TOOK SOME RESTRICTION NOW I JUST DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT YEAND YOUARE NOT RAIN FORCING THE CIRCUITS AND SO YOU INICENCE ARE ARE ARE REMOVING YOURSELVES FROM BAT YOU TEN TO BE THE EXCEPTION IN A WE HAVE A A HUGE A HUGE A INCRIDIBLY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE BEING CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED TO HIGHLY PROSSIS FOODS ET AND HIDDEN THAT SO CALLED HIDDEN SUGAR T   DID N'T EVEN HAVE TO BE HIDDEN I NOW IT'S RIGHT THERE HIDING I AING ASIDE YE I I DREND SO MUCH AS MADE OF HIDDEN SUGARS THAT OM WE OFTEN OVERLOOKED THAT THEY ARE THERE ARE ALSO THE OVER YAMEME WE CAN HAVE A LONG DISCUSSION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF COMING UP WITH STRATIGES OU KNOW THAT COULD MEANINGFULLY CHANGE PUBLIC HELD WHEN HE COMES TO NUTRISUE BUT I WHEN THEY JUST GO BACK TO THE NOTION OF I OF THESE BRAIN CENTRES THAT ARE ULTIMATELY THE ONCE THER BEING ACTIVATED BY THESE ESSENTIAL NUTRANS SO SUGAR FATIN THE MINOACITS ARE BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR DIETS AND THESE IS THAT GROSS ALL ANIMASPIESIES SO IT'S NOT UNREASONABLES IN TO ASUM THAT THIDICATED BRAIN CIRCUITS WIT HAVE EVOLVED TIN SURE THER RECOGNITION THER INGITION AND THE REIN FORSEMENS THAT THAT IS WHAT I NEED AND INDEED IN O ANIMALS IF ALL THE TOL SYSTEMS IT ONE IS THE TAST SISTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO RECOGNIZE IM AND TREGER THESE PRETTETERMING HARD WIRE INMEDIATE RESPONSES IS ON MY GOODNESS THIS IS TAKE SO GOOD TIS SO SWEET I PERSONALLY HAVE A SWEET TOTH MY EY AN AND IN ALM I GODE IS SO DELICIOUS IS FANTY FOR WHOMAMY RECOGNIZING THE MINOASIT SO THAT'S THE LIKIN POT WIT IT BAT IN THE WISDOM OF EVOLUTION THATS GOOD BUT DOESN'T QUITE DO IT YOU WAN I MAKE SURE THAT THIS THINGS GET TO THE PLACE WHERE THERE NEEDED AND THER NOT NEEDED IN YOUR TONGUE THERE NEEDED IN YURINTESTINGS WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABSURE AS THE NEUTRIANCE THAT WILL SUPPORT LIFE AND THE BRAIN ONES TO NOW THIS AND I ONE SO KNOW IT IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN NOW FORM THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THAT THAT I YESTASTIT IS WHAT GAT WORIT NEEDS TO BE AND IT MAKES ME FEEL GOODT AND SO NOW NEXT TIME THAT I HAVE TO CHOOSE WHAT SHOULD I EAT THAT ASSOCIATION NOW GUIDS ME TO THAT'S THE ONE I ONE I WANT THAT FRUIT NOT THAT FRUIT I ONE DOS LEAVES NOT DOSE LEAVES BECAUSE THIS ARE THE ONCES THAT ACTIVELY THE RIGHT CIRCUITS THAT IN SURE THAT THE RIGHT NEUTRIANS GOT TO THE RIGHT PLACE AND TOLD THE BRAIN THIS IS WHAT I ANT AND NEED ARE WE ON RIG ONE THING THAT INTRIGUES ME AND PUZZLES ME IS IS THAT THIS EFFECT TOOK A COUPLE OF DAYS AT LEAST IN MICE YES AND THE SENSATION OS ARE THE PERCEPTION OF DAYS IS IMMEDIATE IS IMMEDIATE AND YET THIS IS A SLOW SYSTEM AND SO IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY BUT IN A CAN A MYSTERIOUS WAY THE WINE IS ABLE TO COUPLE THE TASTE OF A SWEET DRINK WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF NEUTRIENT EXTRACTION IN THE GOD UNDER A CONTACT WHERE THE MOUSE AND THE HUMAN IS PRESUNTLY INJUSTING OTHER THINGS SMELLING OTHER MIE OAND OTHER PEOPLE THAT'S INCREDIBLE YE BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT NOT AS AS HUMANS REMEMBER WE INHERITED THE CIRCUITS OF OUR ANSISTERS AND THEY THROUGH EVOLUTIONARY FROM THEIR ANCISTERS AND WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT MANY IN A YEARS TO HAVE FUNDAMENTALLYS CHANGE IN MANY OF THESE HARD WIRE CIRCUIT SO FORGET AS HUMANS LITS TO GET ANYMAUS IN THE WHILE OGE WHICH IS STER NOW TO COMPREHEND THE LOGIC IN WHY SHOULD TESTAY A LONG TIME OF CONTINUAL REINFORCEMEN EVEN THAT I CAN TASTED IN A SICON YOU WINT A MASURE THAT THESE SOURS OF SUGAR FOR EXAMPLE IN THE WHILE IS HE BASE IS THE RICHES IS THE ONE WERE A GET THE MOST ENERGY FOR THE LEAST AMOUNGE OF EXTRACTION THE LEAST AMOUNT OF WAR I WHEN I DIDN'T DEFY RICH SOURCES OF SUGAR AND IF THE SISTAND SIMPLY RESPONSE IMMEDIATELY TO THE FIRST SUGAR THAT GETS TO YOUR GAT YOURE GON AV FORM THE ASSOCIATION WE THOST SOURCES OF FOOD WHICH ARE NOT THE NES THAT YOU SHOULD BE EATEN FROM DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE FIRST PERSON YOU ENCOUNTER ON MY GOODNESS EXACTLY TEY AND SO EVOLUCIONARILY BY HAVING THE TASTE SISTEM GIVING YOU THE IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION BUT THEN BY FORCING THESE GADBRAIN ACES TO REINFORCE IT ONLY WHEN SUSTAIN IN A REPEAT IT EXPOSURE HAS INFORM THE BRAIN THIS IS THE ONE YOU DON'T WONT A FORM THE ASCERCATION BEFORE AND SO IN A WHEN WE REMOVIT FROM THE CONTECTS OF WE NO WE ASCO TO I NOT THE SUPERMARKET WE'RE NOT HUNTING THERE IN THE WHILE WHERE I NEED TO FORM AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS ARE HIG JACKING YOU KNOW GO OPTIN DESIRCUITS IN A WAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IN NATURE AND THEN WE NOT ONLY FIND THESE THINGS UP A PITITY VAN PALATABLE BEONDITION WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY REINFORSING IN O THE WANTING IN A WAY THAT ALL MY GODI IS SO GREAT WHAT DO I F LIT YETTING LET ME HAVE MORE OF THESE YOU'VE JUST FOREVER CHANGE THE WAY THAT I THINK ABOUT SUPERMARKETS AND RESTAURANTS IT THERA UNDERSTANDING THIS FAST SIGNALLING AND A SLOWER SIGNALLING THE UTILITY OF HAVING BOTH MAKES ME REALIZE THAT SUPERMARKETS AND RESTAURANTS ARE ABOUT THE MOST UNNATURAL THING FOR OR UR SAS AM EVER ALMOST ALMOST ILLREVOLENT OF LIVING IN SMALL VILLAGES WITH VERY FEW A SUITABLE NIGHTS VERSES ON ONEDAT INFORENCE IT WULD AV A NOTON TO MAKE A JUSTMEN COLD ER BECAUSE THEY DO SERVE AN IMPORTANT PURPOSE I LIKE MUS RONE YE BUT AND SO TO SUPERMARKETS THING OW IT IT II THING THERE NOT THE CULPRITS ATING THE COLPRESS OF COURSE YO KNOW IT R R OR RELIANCE ON ON FOOTS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY HEALTHY NOW GOING BACK TO THE SUPERMARKIT DID DON'T FULLING OVE WITH THE FOREST IN NEED TO WORK YOU KNOW YOU TAKE YOU YOU TAKE AT TANGERING AND YOU TAKE AN EXTRACT OF TANGERING THAT YOU USED TO COOK THAT DSPIKE THET EY WITH SUGAR AND YOU EQUALIZE IN BOTH WETE THEY BOTH PROVIDE THE SAME AMOUNT OF CALORIES IF YOU EAT THEM BOTH YHEY WONN'T HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT EFFECT IN YOUR GOD BRAIN ACTES AND YOUR SYSTEM ONCE YOU MAKE THE AXTRIC AND YOU PROSESTIT AND YOU ADT IT PROSESS SUGAR IU KNOT TO USE IT NOW TO COOK TO ADD TO MAKE IT REALLY SWEET TENDURING THING NOW YOU'RE PROVIDING NOW FULLY READY TO USE BROKEN DOWN SOURCE OF SUGAR IN THE TANGERING THAT SUGAR IT SMEEKS IN THE COMPLEXITY OF A WHOLE SAT OBOT E CANME CAL COMPONENTS FIVER LONG CHAINS OF SUGAR MOLICUOS THAT NEED A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK BY YOUR STOM AT YOUR GAT SYSTEM TO BREAK IT DOWN SO YOU'RE USING A HUGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO EXTRACT ENERGY AND THE BALANCE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAT WHEN I TAKE THESE PROCES HIGHLY EXTRACTID TNGERING BY THE WAY I USED TENGURINGS BECAUSE I HAD A TENDURIN YEST BEFORE IT CAME IN DELICIOUS THEY ARE DOLGIT IT AND SO AND SO THESE GOES BACK TO THE SOPS OF SUPERMARKSN  AND SO TO TO TO SOME DEGREE N YOU KNOW A GIVING A CHOICE YOU DON'T WHEN IT PROCESS IGLY PROCESS FOOTS BECAUSE EVEREADY IS ALREADYBEEN BROKEN DOWN FOR YOU AND SO YOUR SISTEM HAS NO WORK AND SO YOUARE COOTING HIGH JACKIN THE CIRCUITS IN A WAY THAT ERE BEING ACTIVATED AT A TIME SCALE THAT NORMALLY WOULDN'T HAPPEN THIS IS WHY I I OFTEN FEEL THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF DAT ARE NOW STARG SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT WHILE INDEED THE LAWS OF THERMODANAMIC SUPPLY CALORIES INJESTED VERSES CALORIES BURN IS A VERY REAL THING RIGHT THAT THE APPETITE FOR CERTAIN FOODS AND THE THE WANTING AND THE LIKING ARE PHENOMENA OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BRAINAN GOT AS YOUE BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBED AND THAT THAT CHANGES OVER TIME DEPENDING ON HOW WE ARE RECEIVING THESE NUTRIN ABSOLUTELY LOOK I WE HAVE A LT OF WORK TO DO AM TOKING THA SOCIETY AM NOT TOLNG ABOUT YOU AND I WE ALSO HAVE A LIT A WENTETNOW IM I THINK UNDERSENDING THE CIRCUITS IT'S GIVENG US IMPORTANT INSIGHTS AND HOW ULTIMATELY HOPEFULLY WE CAN IMPROOF HUMAN HEALT AND MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE NOW IT'S VERY EASY TO TRY TO DE KNOW CONNEC DED NOT A TO BEBE TO SCY TO THE AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE COMPLEXITY TO IT BUT I DO THINK THAT THE LESSENCE OF THEIR EMERGING OUT OF UNDERSTANDING OW THE CIRCUITS UPRIT CAN ULTIMATELY IN FORM HOW WE DEAL WITH OUR DIETS IN A WAY THAT WE AVOID WAT WERE FACING NOW IN US A SOCIETY HAVING EATS NUTS THAT THE OVER NEUTRITION HAPPENS TO BE SUCH A PRIVOLENT PROBLEM AND I ALSO THINK THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT METABOLIC SCIENCE AND METABOLIC DISEASES LARGELY DIVORCED FROM THE TRAINING OF THE NEROW SCIENTIST AND VICE VERSA NO ONE FEELD IS TO BLAIN BUT I FULLY AGREE THAT THE THE BRAIN IS IS THE KEY OVE OR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO BE A MORE ACCURATE IS THE ONE OF THE KEY OVERLOOKED FEATURES IS THE ARVITURE ULTIMATELY IS THE ARVY TURE OF MANY OF THESE PATWAYS AS A FINAL QUESTION IN ONE WHICH IS SIMPLY TO ENTERTAIN MY CURIOSITY AND THE CURIOSITY OF THE LISTENERS WHAT IS YOUR ABSOLUTE

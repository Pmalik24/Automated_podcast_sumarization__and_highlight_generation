WE EXAMINE ALL LEGAL ANGLES REGARDING THE REGAL PROSECUTION AGAINS DONAL TRUMP IN GEORGIA FROM CLENCHES ABOUT TO DROP BOM SHELL NEW REVELATIONSABOUT VOTER FRAUD IN GEORGIA AND THE BY ADMINISTRATION SEEKS TO AVOID THE LAW ON THE FIRMATIVE ACTION I VENTURE OF THIS IS VENTFURO SHO  THEDASHOSPONSER BAG PRESSVEPIEN DO YOU LIKE YOUR RUB HISTORY BEING SEEN AND SOLD TO ADVERTISERS NOW MENEITHER GET IC FRESTYPIAN RIGHT NOW EXPRESS BE PIANZI COM FLASHMEN ALLRIADY SO THIS REGO PROSECUTION IN GEORGIA IS OF COURSE THE HEADLINE OF THE MOMENT IT IS ALSO THE LARGEST LEGAL BARRIER THE DONALD TRUMP FACES GOING FORD BECAUSE IT IS A STATE LEVEL CASE WHICH MEANS THAT IF HE IS CONVICTED IN THE TATE OF GEORGIA HE CANNOT PARDON HIMSELF EVEN WERE HE TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR EVEN WERE A FELLOW REPUBLICAN TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES THE CURN GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA BRYN KEMP DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO UNILADERALLY PARDON DONAL TRUMP ONESTATE CHARGE HAT HAS TO GO IN FRONT OF SOME SORT OF PARDON REVIEWBOARD TO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT DONAL TRUMP IS GOING TO BE SLUGGING IT OUT INCORT WITH FANNY WILLIS HE IS COAN TO BE GOINED BY EIGHTEEN ALLEGED CO CONSPIRATORS AND SO TODAY ORE GANG TO GO THROUGH IN DETAIL THE INDIHEMENT AGAINST DONAL TRUMP AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS SO AS THE LALSTRA TJERNAL POINT OUT THE INDICTMENT IN GEORGIA AGAINST TRUM FOR RACKETTURING AND DOESN'T OTHER ELLEGE DEFENCE HIS REPRESENTS THE MOST AMBITIOUS AND SWEEPING CASE BROUGHT UP AGAINST THE FORM PRESIDENT AND IS LIKELY TO POSED ON PRESEDENTS AT LEGAL CHALLENGE AS BOTH FOR TRUM BUT ALSO FOR THE PROSECUTORS THE CASE BROUGHT BY FANNY WILLIS SENTERS ON ALLEGATIONS THAT TRUMP ALONG WITH EIGHTEEN OTHERS PARTICIPATED IN A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE TO CHANGE THE TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN HIS FAVOR IN VIOLATION OF THE STATES ANTI RACETURING LAW THAT GEORGIA LAW IS MONALTON THE NINETEEN SEVENTY RECO ACT THAT'S THE RACKETS YUR INFLUENCE AN CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACTICH IS REALLY DESIGNED TO GO AFTER THE MAFIA GEORGIA'S LAW IS IN SOME RESPECTS BROADER THAN THE FEDERAL VERSION REGEORGIA'S REGO STATUTE ALLOWS THE PROSECUTOR TO TELL A LOT OF THE STORY APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN KEYS FLEMING FORMID TO CALB COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO AS NOW AT THE LAW FROM DEELA PIPER WHICH I THE MAJOR LAFFRAM WILLIS IS INDICTMENT IS THIS LONG SPRONLING THING THAN ENCOMPASSES DONALD TRUMP'S ACTIVITIES WITH RELATION TO LEGISLATORS AND PENNSYLVANIA WITH RELATION TO VARIOUS MEMBERS OF HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION WITH MEMBERS OF THE D OGIE WITH HIS LAWYERS THE NINETY EGHT PAGE INDICHTMENT IS BASICALLY JUST AN ENTIRE NARRATIVE STORY ABOUT DONAL TRUMPS ATTEMPTS TO INTERVENE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION BUT IT DOESN'T ANSWER THE KEY CUASTIONE WHICH IS WEATHER DONAL TRUMP ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN WHAT WOULD BE A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE AND THAT HAS AN ACTUAL LEGAL DEFINITION IS WHERE THIS WAS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE OR NOT NOWAS WE SAY WILLIS ALSO FACES SOME CHALLENGES HERE SHE SAYS SHE WANTS A TRIALTOY WITHIN THE NEXT EX MONTHS THAT IS VERY UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN GERY SELECTION COULD DRAG ON FOR MONTH THIS LIKELY GO WAYPAST THE ELECTION MORE THAN THAT TRUM COULD ALSO SEEK TO MOVE THE CASE TO FEDERAL CORT IN PACKMARK MEDOS IS CO CONSPIRATOR A LEGE CO CONSPIRATOR IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE HE IS ALREADY ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THIS THING TWO FEDERAL CORT BASELY SAYIN THITS A FEDERAL CHARGE WHY YEU CHARGING THIS ON THE STATE LEVEL NOW GTRUMP DID TRY TO DO THAT WITH HIS NEW YORK PROSECUTION THAT WAS REJECTED ON THE GROUNDS THE TRUMPLESSN'T CARRYING OUT HIS PRESIDENTIAL DUTIES WITH REGARD TO ELEGE PUSH MONEY SCHEME BUT THIS IS MUCH MORE DIRECTLY TIED TO HIS PRESIDENCY AND HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO LEAVE IT SO COULD THIS THING BE REMOVED TO A FEDERAL COURT IT'S CERTAINLY COULD BE AND IF THAT HAPPENS THAT GI BIGWIN FOR TRUMP BECAUSE THT WOULD MEAN TAT HE CAN SELECT FROM A BROADER JURY POOL ONE O THE THINGS THAT FANNY WILLIS IS COUNTING ON HERE IS THAT THE JUDGE PRESUME WY WON'T KICK OUT HER CHARGES WILL TALK AOUT WHETHER THAT WILL HAPPEN OR NOT IN JUST MOMENT ALSO SHE'S COUNTING ON THIS BEING A FULTAN COUNTY JURY AS SUPPOSED TO BEING A BROADER POOL OF COUNTIES THAT ARENT INCLUDED IN THE JURY POOL CAS TO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE RACKETS YOUR INFLUENCE AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT SO IT WAS REALLY DESIGNE TO GO AFTER THEMOFF YET AS I SAY IT WAS DESIGNED FOR CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES NOW ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK THAT FANNY WLLIS IS CHARGING THIS AS SUPPOSED TO SAY JUST THE CRIME OF CONSPIRACY RI CONSPIRACYES AN ACTUAL CRIME YOU CAN CHARGE SOME WITH COMM CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT A CRIME SO F YOU AND I WE MAKE A PLAN TO GO ROBA BANK WE ARE ENOUGE TO GET CHARGED UNDER REKO WE COULD JUST BE CHARGE WOT THE NORMAL CONSPIRACY STATUTE TAT IS A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY TBECAUSE YOU AND I ARE GETTING TOGETHER TO PURSUE A CRIME REKO WAS WRITTEN FOR THE SHADOWY GREAY AREA WERE THEY KNOW THAT WERE KIND OF HANGING OUT TO GETHER BUT HEY'RE NOT REALLY SURE THAT I GAVE YOU AN ORDER OR THAT I MADE AN ACTUAL ORGANIZED PLAN TO GO ROB THE BANK THEY JUST N A LOT OF BANKS ARE GTTING ROB AND I'M BENEFITING IN SOME WAY AND YOUR BENEFITING IN SOME WAY AND SOME ORDERS WERE GIVEN AT SOME LEVEL THIS WAS ALWAYS THE TROUBLE FOR THEMOFYA WAS THE PLAUSIBLE DEN IABILITY WAS THE ABILITY FOR THE PERSON THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN TO SAY I NEVER KNEW AT THAT HIT MAN WAS DOING I NEVER TOLD THE HITMAN WHAT TO DO IT' JUST CANNAGAT DON SO HOW COULD YOU GO AFTER THAT GI WHELE THEY WROTE THE REKO ACT IN ORDER TO GO AFTER THAT GIE THE WAY THEY DID THAT IS THAT THEY SAID THAT YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR CRIMES IN WICH YOU ARE DIRECTLY IMPLICATED IN WHICH THERE'S A DIRECT CONSPIRACY YOUKNOW YOU AND I GETTING TOGETHER WITH THE MAP WITH TE GUN AND DECIDING TO ROB THE BANK DOWN THE STREET RIT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY KIND OF CRIME HE CAN BE CHARGED WITH NOW NOW YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF ANYBODY WHO'SE WITHIN YOUR CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE SO WHAT EXACTLY IS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE HOUSE THAT'S TO FINE THAT IS AN ENTERPRISE DESIN TO DO CRIME RIGT'S AN ENTERPRISE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BASICALLY CREATED BONDS WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT'SWHAT AN ENTERPRISE IS AND THEY DO A WIDE VARIETY OF CRIMES THAT CRIMINAL PURSUITS IS THEIR BUSINESS RTO WHEN WHEN YOU CHARGED A MAFIOSO WITH THE REKO BIOLATION WE NOT CHARGING WITH THIS SPECIFIC MURDER YOU'RE CHARGIN WITH BEING PART OF THE JIANT ORGANIZATION TAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CRIMES UP TO AN INCLUDING MURDER FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN BY PROXY HE'S ALSO INCLUDED IN THOSE CHARGES WELL WHAT IS THIS MEAN WHY WY EXACTLY IS FANNY WILL IS DOING THIS WHY ISN'T JUST CHARGING CONSPIRACY WELL THE REASON IS TWOFOLD ONE IS NOT PARTICULARLY CLEAR THAT FANNY WILLIS ACTUALLY HAS THE HARD EVIDENCE THAT DOWNEL TRUMP TOLD PEOPLE I WANT YOU TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION KNOWING THAT IS FALSE RYEFT UE TO PROVE INTEND IF I IF TE CONSPIRACY TO COMIT A CRIME YOET THAVE INTEND TO DO THE SORTS OF CRIMES IF TO DO THE CRIMES WILLINGLY L LHAT'S ALWAYS BEENTH BIG QUESTION FOR TRUM AS I'VE BEEN SAYING YOAS LONG AS HE'S BEEN UNDER THE LEGAL GUN TESTABLISHING INTENT FOR TRUMPAS A VERY DIFFICULT BUSINESS LEGALLY SPEAKING BECAUSE PRESUMABLY YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO FINE SOME SORT OF THROUGH LINE YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THE THINGS HE SAYING THEY'S ACTUALLY LYING ABOUT THOSE THING AND THAT'S HARD PLOSWILL DENIABILITY DOES EUS FOR DONALTRUP SO WHAT IS HOU DOING SHE'S CHARGING HIM WITH A REGAL VIOLATION WHY BECAUSE IN A REGAL VIOLATION THE MOFIOSO DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE SPECIFIC INTENT TO COMMIT THE CRIME HE GETS IMPLICATED JUST BY BEING PART OF THE GENERALIZED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE DO JA HAS RUN DOWN ON WHAT EXACTLY RECO DOES HERE'S WHAT THEY SAY THE GOVERNMENT NEED NOT PROVE THE DEFENDENT AGREED WITH EVERY OTHER CONSPIRATOR NEW ALL OF THE OTHER CONSPIRATORS OR HAT FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE DETAILS OF THE CONSPIRACY ALL THE MUST BE SHOWN IS THAT THE DEFENDENT AGREED TO COMMIT THE SUBSTANCE OF RA CONCIRING OFFENTE THROUGH A GREEING TO PARTICIPATE IN RACKETTEERING ACTS THAT HE KNEW THE GENERAL STATUS OF THE CONSPIRACY AND TAT HE KNEW THE CONSPIRACY EXTENDED BEYOND HIS INDIVIDUAL RULE S THAT MEANS THAT DONALTRUP WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO HAVE SPECIFIC INTENT TO CORRUPTLY OVERTURN THE ELECTION KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THE ELECTION HAD BEEN DECIDED AGAINST HIM AND THAT THAT THAT ACTUALY GOES AWAY THE INTEN AS LONG AS SOMEBODY IN HIS ORBIT KNEW AS LONG AS RU JULIANI KNEW AS LONG AS SIDNEY PALLANE AS LONG AS ONE F THE CO CONSPIRATORS KNEW THET DONA TRUMP HAD LOST AND THEN WAS PURSUIG THIS LEGAL STRATEGY IF YOU CONSIDER IT A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE AS THA CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THEN DONAL TROM COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THOSE CRIMES WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO EXPRESS THE INTENT THIS IS HOW FANNY WILLIS IS ATTEMPTING TO END AROUND THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF CRIMINAL LAW LIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE INTENT TO COMMT A CRIME IN ORDER TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT CRIME NOW THERE'S ANOTHER PROMETER WHICH WILL GET TO IN  JUST ONE SECOND FIRST YOU KNOW COMPANY IS LOOKING OUT FOR YOU IN THE ACTUALLY UPGREATER SERVICEONS DON'T CHARGE YOU FOR IT THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR NEW AND CURRENT PURE TOCK CUSTOMERS PRE TALK JUST ATIDATED TO EVERY PLAN AND INCLUDES A MOLAHOTSPOT WITH NO PRICE INCREASE WHATSOEVER IF YOU CONSIDERE PURE TALK BEFORE WE HAVEN'T MADE THE WITCH TAKE A LOOK AGAIN FOR JUST TWENTY BUKS MONT HOU' GET UNLIMITED TALK TAXAT NOW FIFTY PERECENT MORE FIVE SHE DID A PLUS THEIR NEW OLE HOSPOT THIS IS WY LOVE PURE TALK THER BETERAN OWN THEY ONLY HIRE THE BEST CUSTOMER SEIRVICE SEEM LOCATED RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES WO AMERICA MOST FAMILY ARE THER ARE SAVING ALMOST A THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR WHILE EN JOYING THE MOST DEPENDABLE FIVE SHE NET WORK IN THE CONTRY REMEMBER YOUVOTH HA YOU SPEND YOUR CASH TO STOP SUPPORTING THES WOKE WIRELESS COMPANIES THAT DON'T ASHALLY LIKE YOU VERY MUCH WHEN GO TO PURE TALK TOT COM SLASH OF PURO THEU'L SAVE IN IS ITIOALL FIFTY PERCENT OFF YOUR FIRST MONTH BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY VALUE YOU THAT'S PURE TALKAT DOT COM SLASH OF PURO PURE TALK IS WIRELESS FOUR AMERICANS BY AMERICANS I USE THEM FOR ALL MY BUSINESS COVERS AND YOU KNOW I RUN A VERY LARGE BUSINESS SA MEANS THAT I REALLY RELY ON THEM FOR SOME TH MOST IMPORTANT STUFFOR MY LIFE YOU SHOULD TOO THAT A GREAT SELL MET WORK YOU'LL ENJOY THAT COVERA ANDULAN TRY THE PRISE PURE TALK DOT COM SLASH OF PURE TO SAVE IN ADITIONAL FIFTY PERCENT OFF YOUR VERY FIRST MONTH OF COVERAGES FPURE TALK AGAIN WIRELESS FOUR AMERICANS BY AMERICANS UGA SO FANNY WILLIS CANT CAN'T REALLY CLAIM THAT HE'S PART OF A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THO COME OFF YET LAKE IS THIS CROUPL OF PEOPLE A  LIKE A MOFF YE FAMILY THATS JUST DARE TO COMMIT CRIMES E GRACKETTEERING IS AN ON GOING SERIES OF PRIVES TYPICALLY OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S TIPICALLY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT RAGE FOR TONG ABOUT ALCOPON TUNG ABOUT HE'S BOOT LEGGING OVER MANY MANY YEARS AND THEN VOLVES SHAKING PEOPLE DOWN INVOLVES CORRUPTLY SENDING ALCOHOL OVER STATE LINES IND OVER FEDERAL LINES INVOLVES NOT PANYOR TAXES ANVOLVES AT WIDE VARIETY OF OFFENCES BECAUE I'S A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IS DONAL TRUMPET SINY PALLO CRIMNAL ENTERPRISE OR SHOULD THAT THEORETICALLY REALLY BE CHARGED OAN ARE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT A CRIMINAL ACT BUT THEN THAT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHAT EXACTLY IS THE CRI RELACET BECAUSE DONAL TRUM CIN SAY ITS NOT A CRIMINAL ACT FOR ME TO PURSUE A SPECIOUS LEGAL STRATEGY I SPECIOUS LEGAL STRADISHE IS NOT A CRIMINAL ACT THAT'S FREE SPEECH AND THIS IS WIFE ANNY RULES IS CHARGEING IT UNDER REKO AND NOT UNDER CONSPIRACY AGAIN IF THE SCHEME WAS FORMULATED IN ORDER TOKEEP HIM AN OFFICE IF THE SCHEME ITSELF WAS A CRIME SHEWOULD BE CHARGEING CONSPIRACY BUT SHE KNOWS THE SCHEME ITSELF IS IN TO CRIME SINCE STAD SHE'S TRYING TO CHARGE IT UNDER REKO CLAIMING THE ENTIRE KIT AND COBOODLE IS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE SO  SHE SORT OF DOING IN BETWEEN SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY THAIT CRIME ACTUALLY WAS INTENDED AND SHE ACTUALLY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO ESTABLISH THAT THERE IS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IF SHE GETS AWAY WITH ALL OF THIS IT S IT'S A REAL MISCHARGE R THE VERY LEAST IT'S A BIG STRACH NOW THE THING ABOUT A STRETSH CHARGE LIKE THIS AGAINST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES IS THAT ONCE YOU BREAK THE GLASS THE GLASS IS NOW BROKEN NOW LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIT I'M NOT AGAINST THE IDEA THAT PRESIDENTS EX PRESIDENTS PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY SHOULD BE HELD SHOULD NOT BEHELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLATION OF THE LAW THE THING THATI REALLY EM AGAINST IS THE BELIEF THAT A PARTISAN PROSECUTOR GETS TO DESIDE WHO GOES AND WHO STAYES ONE THE BIG PROMISE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT SOMEBODY GETS INDITED IS IF THAT PERSON IS THE POLITICAL ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE IN POWER AND THIS GOES ALLWAY BACK TO FOR EXAMPLE BAROKABAMA OR HILLERY CLINTON SO I SAID THIS ABOUT DONALD TRUMPET TRO GRAND O THE CLASS FI DOCUMENS TWO THINGS CON BE TOR ONCE DONAL TRUM PRETTY OBVIOUSLY VIOLATED CLASS BY DOCUMENT STATUTES THEY HAVEN'T BASICALLY DEAD TO RIHTS ON THE CHARGEENS AN MED HE LITERALLY SAID ONTAPE FOLKS LEGAL ADVICE NEVER DO TH CRIMING ONTATE HE LITERALLY SAID ONYTAPE HERE A CLASSIFIED DACCUMENTS I COULD HAVE UNCLASSIFIED THAT I DIDN'T HE CLASSIFIED THEM YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THEM RIGHT M THAT IS DOING THE CRIME ON THE TATE SO SHOULD HE BE PROSECUTED OR NOT WELL IN ANY NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE THE ANSWER WOULD BE ES SURE WHY NOT OF COURSE IF YOU COM IN A CRIME SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR THE CRIME THE PROBLEM IS ONCE JAMES COME LET HILLERY CLINTON OFF THE HOOK FOR CRIMES AT THAT POINT THE ANSWER BECOMES KNO AND THE ANSWR BECOMES KNO BECAUSE IF ONLY ONE SIDE HAS TO PLAY BY THE RULES THEN THE RULES ARE NOT RULES THAT THEY ARE JUST A DOUBLE STANDARD THEY ARE JUST A WEAPON AND THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING RIGHT HERE SO BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ASSHE ADVOCATED FOR A FOULL SCALE USE OF RECOAT TO GO AFTER POLITICIONS HES HIT SAID LISTEN BUT I WOULD LIKE IS ACTUALLY WIDESPREAD USE OF RIKO TO GO AFTER VARIOUS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES RUN BY POLITICIONS I RON IN TIRE BOOKLL THE PEOPLE VERSES BAROKOBAMA IN WHICH I SUGGESTED THAT BARACABAMA HAD VERY LIKELY ENGAGED IN BY FANNY RULLS IS DEFINITION REKO VIOLATIONS TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE IRASCANDALE THE IRASCANDAL BARACABMAMA AND HIS MINIONS WENT OUT IN PUBLIC AND REPEATEDLY SAID THATITWOULD BE AMAZING IF THE IRES AUGHTED ID AND REMOVE THE TAC EXEMPTION FOR PRETY MUCH EVERY CONSERVATIVE GROUP IN AMERICA LEADING UP TO THE TWENTY TON ELECTION AND THEN THE ACTUALLY WEN THEY DID IT AND THEN THE IRAS WHEN DID IT AND HE SAID WHY NEVER MEANT FOR THEM TO DO IT WELL I MEAN AGAIN THAT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE SORT OF MAFIOSO ACTIVITY REKO WAS MEANT TO STOP IN E FIRST PLACE NOW WHEN I MADE THIS ARGMENT BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE ENTIRE PRESS THAT REVIEWED THE BOOKS AT THIS IS CRAZY YOU COULD NEVER DO THIS HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY SUGGEST SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND MY ANSWER WAS YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE IF WE FINALLY STARTED HOLDING POLITICIANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE VARIOUS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THEY WULD STOP DOING THE CRIMING BUT THE PROBLEM IS THIS THEY IGNORE BROKOBAMA AND THEN THEY IGNORED HILLERY CLINTON TAND THE'R CURRENTLY IGNORING HUNTER BIDON AND COBIDON BY THE WAY VERY SOLID CASE THAT THE SORT OF RECO VIOLATIONS THAT WE ARE CURENTLY TALKING ABOUT WITH REGARDS DONAL TRUMP AND ELECTION OF TWENTY TWENTY THOSE FAR BETTER FIT THE CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS COMMITTED BY HUNTER BIDON IN JOBIDE YOURS OR LT A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE YOU R I'S LOK A RECO CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE LIKE A FAMILY LET'S SAY THEYOU HAD A FAMILY LIKE AN ACTUAL HONEST GOT FAMILY NI'LL COME OFF A FAMILY A FAMILY FAMILY NOW THEM MOFFYOR FAMILY START OFF HICE FAMILY LETS YO GET A FAMILY FAMILY AND THAT FAMILY SENT A BAG MAN TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO PICK UP CASH ON BEHALF OF EVERY RELATIVE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAL E VICE PRESIDENT WAS PRESIDING OVER FOREGN POLICY IN THOSE COUNTRIES I MEAN DOES THE PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY THEYRE SOUND SORT OF LIKE AMOFF YO SITUATION WHEN WHEN JOBIDON WAS LITERALLY CALLING INTO HUNTER BIDON'S BUSINESS MEETINGS AND SAYING HOW IS THE WEATHER OVER THERE DOESN THIS DON'T EXACTLY LIKE WHOT A M OFF YO SO WOULD DO YOU GET THE DAWN ON THE LINE AND HAVE THE LOCAL BARTENDER HOW'S THE WEATHER DOWN THEAND THEN EVERYBODY KNOWS PRETTY CLEARLY THAT IF THE BARTENDER DOESN'T PAY OFF THE MOF YOSO THEN THE PLACE GOES UP IN FLAMES ME DAT LOOKS ALA LIKE A RECO VIOLET AND YOU YEREN TO TALG OUT RECO VIOLATIONS YOU FIND RECO VIOLATIONS PETTY MUCH ANYWHERE AND YOU KNOW WHAT I' BE KIND OF OCET WITH THAT IF THIS WERE EVEN REMOTELY EVENLY APPLIED BUT IT IS NOT REMOTELY EVEN LY APPLIED IT IS ONLY APPLID TO DONALD TRUMP ONLY ONLY ONLY SO AGAIN IF YOU ON TO HAVE A SET OF RULES TAT APPIES TO EVERYBODY EVENLY I'M TOTALLY FORID BUT IF THE RULES ONLY APPLIE TO DONALD TRUMP WE CAN ALL SEE WAT YOU'R DOING WELL THE'RE GONTO GET THEIR WISH THE RULES WILL BE APPLIED TO EVERYONE BUT NOT EVENLY IN FULLY PARSON FASHION SO THERE'S A CLIP GOING ROUND ME AN TWENTY FOURTEEN TALKING ABOUT THE BOUT THAT I MENTION T PEOPLE FOR SUBAROKOBAMA HERE'S WHA I HAD TO SAY AT THE TIME ABOUT THE USE OF RECO TOGO AFTER POLITICIANS I  NUTHUR RECAN INSITE WASHINGTONT I THINK THAT THE  CERTAINLY OR SUIS SOMTHIN WAS DON WALKING ANS RELATIVELYQUAN BUT IBUT IB IF YOU LOOK IT THAT YOU KNOW HOR SHALL BE BLUS SH OR IF YOU LOOK TAT BELL CLENSTEN OR I YOULOOTS O RONALD RAGON SIR I MEAN THE ANSWER WOULD BE THAT THAT YOU COULD AND AND PEOPLE SHOULD BE WARY I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS SORT OF THE CASE THAT I MAKING IS THAT WE'VE BECOME SO COMFORTABLE WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT ABUSING AT CITIZENS AND VIOLATING OUR RIGHTS AND VIOLATING WHAT THEYRE STRUCTURE TO DO UNDER THE LAW THT WE'VE JUST BECOME USE TO IT AND AND IF WE START TREATING THEM AS CRIMINALS MAY BE THE' THING TWICE BEFORE THEY ACT SO CRIMINALLY IN THE FUTURE BUT GA NOTICE WHAT I SAY IN THAT CLIP IN THAT CLIP I SAY THE COULD THEORETICALLY APPLY THESE SORTS OF LEGAL VIOLATIONS TO ANY PRESDENT RAAM TONG OUT YORE SHALL BE BUSH AND RON RIGAN BOTH REPUBLICANS AND BILL CLINTON A DEMOCRAT RIGHT I'M TALKING ABOUT PRETTY MUCH EVERY PRESIDENT BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN INCLUDING BAROKABAMA AND THE POIN THAT I MAKING IS IF YOU'L EVENLY APPLY THE LAW OKAY BUT GUESS WHAT'S HAPPENED NO REMOTE EVEN APPLICATION OF THE WALL AND HERE IN LIES THE PROBLEM FOLKS IF YOUR GEN TO USE RECO TO G AFTER NONAL TRUMP YOU BETTER DAMN WELL USE IT TO GO AFTER HILLORY CLINTON AND THAT WOOD LINTON FOUNDATION YOU BTTER DAMN WELL USE IT TO GO AFTER BAROKOBAMA AND BAROKO BOM IS INBOLVEIN WIDE VARIETY OF SCANDALS UNDER HIS TENURE YOU BETTER DAMWELL OUSE GOT THEIR HUNTER AND JO BIDE WICH LOOK MORE LIKE A RECAL VIOLATION THAT ANYTHING THE DONAL TRUMP IS DONE HERE THAT'S THE POINT THI LL GET ST MORE IN THE SUG JUST ONE SECOND FIRST SIMPLE FACT INTE MATTER DO NOT LIKE VESERVALS VESERALS BAD THEY TASTE TERRIBLE AND THE GODS REVENGE ON MAN BUT YOU NEED THEM YOU NEED THEM SADLY BECAUSE OTHERWISE WILL NOT BE HEALTHY BUT THIS IS WHERE I RELY ON BALANCE OF NATURE BALANCE OF NATURE FRUITS AND VEGUES ARE GREAT WAY TO MAKE SURE THTYOU'RE GETING ESENTIAL NUTRICIONAL INGREDIENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY THE AMERICAN HART ASSOCIATION RECOMMENDS FORTO FIVE SERVINGS EACH OF FRUITS AND VEGUES EVERYTHNGLE THEY THAT'S A LA OF RUITS AN VEGU'S BALANCE OF NATURE CAN HELP YOU

PROG DOWN TO THE STUDIO FOR MI TEM TO TRY EVERYBODY LOVES THEM I'VE BEEN TAKING THEM THEIR COSERS SO I CAN USE THEM MYSELF A'S REALLY EXCITED TO FIND OUT AS I SAY THAT IT WAS CERTIF ID COSER SO I COULD USE THEM IT'S MADE ME FEEL A LOT BETTER GIVEN THE FACT THATI'M NOT GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP AND MY KITS ARE SICK ALL THE TIME BUT BALANCE OF NATURE DOT COMIT USE PROMAL COOCHO PEURE  FOR THIRTY FIVE PER CENTS OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER AS THEY PREFERRED CUSTOMER THAT'S BALANCE OF NATURE DOT COM FROMO COAOC TURE PROR FOR THIRTY FIVE PERCENTS OFF YOUR FIRST PREFERR ORDER BUT GAYSTE SO THE ABSOLUTELY UNEVEN STATIS OF THESE SORTS OF PROSECUTIONS IT WILL NOT STAND WHAT WILL EN OF HAPPENING IS THERE WILL BE MOTIVATED RE PUBLICAN PROSECUTEORS WHO DO BRING WHEN RECAL VIOLATIONS AGAINST JOE AND HUNTER BITON FOR EXAMPLE A' THERNEUSE TOF BE IS THE PROSECUTOR WITH COURAGE IN A LOCAL JURISTICTION TO DO THIS THAT'S ALL THAT REALLY NEDS TO HAPPEN HERE AND A FRIENDLY JURY AF WET NOW WE CAN PLAY THE CAME ALL DAY LONG BECAUSE THEY BROKE THE GLASS THE CASE THAT THY ARE MAKING AGANST ME AND ALL ADMIT THAT IT WAS A LEASTI CASE IS ONCE YOU BREAK THE GLASS TAND EVERY ONE IL BE PROSECUTE CASE OUS MANE IS FINE LET'S DO IT BUT HERE'S THE PROBLENCE YOUVE DONE IT GET READY GET READY BECAUSE THIS IS WHERRIGN TO BY AND THERE WILL BE A DOWNSIDE AFFECTURE BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN FACT TA NON PARTISAN D O JAY EVEN HANDEDLY APPLAYING WALL WE NOW HAVE A BUNCH OF LOCAL DEADS ALL OVER TE COUNTRY DECIDING TAT THEY WANT O GET THEIR NAME ON THE ON PAPER N THA'S WAY GOT FANNY WILLIS IN GEORGI AR DOING THIS ANDHIS WAY YET THE PROSECUTOR ALVAN BRAG UP IN MANHATTON DOING THIS PEOPLE WANT THEIR NAME IN THE PAPER THEY CAN EXPECT THITS ON ALL SIDE ONE OF THE PREDICTABLE RESULTS OF THIS IS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FAMILIES PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SENSE OF SHAME PEOPLE DO NOT WISH TO SEE THEIR LIVES AT DUG THROUGH ARE SIMPLY IN A STAYWAY FROM POLITICS THAT'S THE ATURAL NATURAL EFFECT OF ALL THIS IS THAT THE BEST WILL NOT GOING TO POLITICS ANY MORE NO BE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRETTY MUCH WILLING TO SLUG IT OUT IN COURT EVERY SING LE THEY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FROM HERE ON IN SO I'M NOT SURE THE DEMOCRAT'S UNDERSTAND THE THE CAN OF WORMS THEY'VE NOW OPEN IF THEVEEN SANG FOR A LONG TIME THE DONAL TRUMP HE'S NOT NORMAL IT'S JUST THE BAT NORMAL USE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES ANDIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT NORMAL AND I WON'T BE THE FIRST TOADMIT THAT I THINK THE DONAL TRUMP HAS BEHAVED IN WAYS THA ARE NOT TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH T WORD PRESIDENTIAL BUT IN TERMS OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT HE'S CRALLY BEING INDICTED FOR THE NOTION THT IT IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR A PRESIDENTS OF TH UNITED STATES TO ENGAGE IN WORDER LINE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN REGAL VIOLATING WAYS THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT TRU AND DONAL TRUMP IS NOT AN EXCEPTION IN THIS WAY AND HE WILL NOT BE TREATED AS ONE FOR VERY LONG IF RE PUBLICANS HAVE THE WITS ABOUT THEM AND IT MAY BE THT WE'VE NOW ENTERED THE AIR OF MUTUALLY SURE DESTRUCTION THE ONLY WAY TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING RESEMBLING NORMAL IS TO ABSOLUTELY GO UP AGAINST FOR EXAMPLE HUNTER IN JOBIDON AND NOT JUST PURSUES SOMETHING LIKE IMPEACHMENT BUT PRUSUT CRIMINAL INDITMEN IN  SOME SORT OF STATE LAW AGAINST HUNTER IN GOBIDEN IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT THAT LOCAL GEORGIA RECO VIOLATION IS BEING PURSUED I I PROMISE YOU THERE IS SOMETHING THERE WITH REGARD TO THE BIDENS THAT LOOKS A LOT MORE LIKE A MAFIOSO FAMILY THAN ANYTHING THAT DONAL TRUMP DID WITH RUDY JULIANI AT THE FOR SEASONS GARDENING STORE OR SOMETHING I GA MEANWHILE DONAL TRUMP IS THAT RESPONDING TO ALL F THIS PLEDGING THAT HE IS GOING TO GIVE AN IRREFUTABLE REPORT ON GEORGIA ELECTION FOUGHT NOW I ASSUME THAT THE REASON T HE IS DOING THIS IN TERMS OF LAW N I DON'T KNOW THESE THE THING TO HIS LAWYERS DONAL TRUMPS NOT FAMOUS FOR LISTENING TO HIS LAWYERS HE TENS TO BUCKTAM PRETTY OFTEN AS I'VE SAID BEFORE ONE OF THE HARDESTROPS IN AMERICA IS BEING DONNE TRUM'S LAWYER BUT I SON ONE OF THE REASONS THE TRUMP IS DOING THIS TIS TO RE ESTABLISH THAT HE LEGITIMATELY BELIEVES THAT HE WON THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION AND THAT GEORGIA WAS STOLEN FROM HIM BECAUSE IF HE CAN ESTABLISH THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE INTEN TOCOMMIT A CRIME HEU JISTEND INTEND TO FOR EXAMPLE ACTUALLY UPHOLDS HIS RIGHTS THAT TAKES WAY THE INTENT PART OF THE CRIME NOW AS I MENTION BEFORE IF ANNY WILLIST MAY BE INTENDING TO TCAN V GO A ROUND TAT BY CHARGING HIM WITH A REGAL VIOLATION WITH THAT SAID TRUMP'S BEST DEFENSE HERE IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL CRIME OF ALL THIS TO SAY I NEVER HAD THE REQUISITE INTENT IS JUST ME PURSUING A LEGAL STRATIGY ALL YOU THINK IS SPECIOUS BUT I THOUGHT WAS WORTH WHILE BECAS IT WAS APPARENT TOME THAT I WAS BEING JOBS HE PUT OUT A A TRUTH IN WHICH HE SAID QUOTE A LARGE COMPLEX DETAIL BUT IRREFUTABLE REPORT ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FRAUD WHICH TOOK PLACE IN GEORGIA IS ALMOST COMPLETE AND WILL PE PRESENTED BY ME THAT A MAJOR NEWS CONFERENCE AT ELEVEN A M ON MONDAY OF NEXT WEEK IN BEDMANSTER NEW JERSEY THEY SEND THE RESULTS OF THIS CONCLUSIVE REPORT ALL CHARGERS SHOULD BE DROPPED AGAINST ME ANDOTHERS THERE WILL BE A COMPLETE EXONERATION THEY NEVER WENT AFTER THOSE THAT RIGGE THE ELECTION THEY ONLY WENT AFTER THOSE THAT FOUGHT TO FIND THE RIGORS SO AGAIN AS I SAY I ACTUALY THINK TO  SMART IN TERMS OF O PURE LEGAL STRATEGY I THINK THERE'S A REASON THE DONAL TRUM IS IS DOING THAT BRY IN CEMP THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED BY SAYING AATIS THIS BULLCRAP HE IMEDIATELY SAID THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION AN GEORGE WAS NOT STOLEN FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS NOW ANY ONE WITH EVIDENCE AFFRAUD HAS FAILED TO COME FORWARD UNDER OATH AN PROVE ANYTHING IN A CORT OF LAW HE SAYS OUR ELECTIONS IN GEORGIA ARE SECURE AXCESSIBLE AND FAIRE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS LONG AS I'M GOVERNOR THE FUTURE OR COUNTRIES AT STAKEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THAT MUST BE OUR FOCUS AGAIN WHAT TRUMP IS DOING HERE I THINK HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT THE RES FRAUD N GEORGIA AND A LOT TO DO WITH ESTABLISHING THAT HE DIDN'T HAE INTENDES VIOLATE THE LAW HE HAD INTEND TO UPHOLDS HIS RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW BUT AN INJUST ONE SECON WILL GET TO THE ACTUAL FORMATICS OF OF TRUMPS O REST THERE'S QUESTION US WHETHER HE WILL EVEN GET BALE AT THIS POINT FIRST VIRY TIRED OF FEELING UN COMFORTABLE IN YOUR UNDERWHEARAND LOUNGE WHERE ESPECIALLY DURING THOSE SCORCHING SUMMER MONTHS THANKS TO MY FRIENDS OVER A TOMMY CHIN E CAN HAVE THE PERFECT BLEND OF COMFORT AND BREATHABILITY WHEN YOU ARE TOMMY JOHN YOUR SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAT YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING BETTER THERE UNDERWHAR HAS DOZENS

WHERE WITH A LEVELE SOFTNESS THAT HONESTLY CANNOT BE PARALLELED THERE INCREDIBLY SOFF LOUNGE WHERES AS IGNE TO ENVELOP YOU IN A WORLD OF PURE LUXURY IS INCREDIBLY DURABLAN THROWIN THE WASH WITH A

COMFORTABLE THEY'VE A BUNCH OF INIVATIONS THAT MAKE IT THE BEST UNDERWHERE ON THE MARKET GO CRECK HIM OUT RENOW TOMMY JOHN DOT COM SLASHMEN FOR TWENTY PERSENT OFF O CASE SO THE FORMATICS OF THIS SITUATION FOR TRUMP ARE ARE REALLY TROUBLING OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SERIOUS CLUSTION OW AS SWHETHER DONALS TRUMP IS ACTUALLY GOING TO GET BAL ACCORDING TO CERTAIN ATTORNIYS GEORGE'S LEGALS PROVISION ON BAILE CULD ACTL PPOSES DELEMUP FORD THE JODGE TBE CAUSE GEORGA BASICALLY SAYS THAT DOME YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RELEASE SOMEBODY ON BAL WHO MAY THEN POSE A RISK OF INTIMINATING WITNESSES OR OTHERWISE OBSTRUCTING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE SO IF A JODGE WERE TO FINE THAT  DONALD TRUMP COULD THEORETICALLY TAMPER WITH WITNESSES OR THAT HE CALL UP HIS CO CINSPIRATORS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OR FOR JODGE FINDS THAT HIM TWEATING THINGS OUT INSTERT OF COTED MESSAGES TO WITNESSES COULD AMOUNT TO SOME FORMAL WITNESS TAMPERING THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT SOME STATE JUDGE  WANTS TO GET HIS NAME ON TE MAP OR HER NAME ON THE MAP COULDTHEORETICALLY DENY BALESO TRUM WHIC WOULD BE UTTERLY INSANE MEAN TOTALLY GI CAN'T IMAGIN THAT'S HW THE S IN GO BUT I MEAN WE ARE IN UNIMAGINAL PLACE RIGHT NOW MEANWHILE THEY'VE ARDY ANNOUNCED IN THE CORT HOUSE IN FUL AND COUNTY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO ANDS UP HAVING TO A DO A MUG SHOP WHICH IS PRETTY ABSURD HIS TYPIALY AMONG SHOT IS DONE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH

DOCUMENT STUFF PUT OUT A TWEET OF HERSELF WEARING A HAP TITS AD BUTTER EMALS THIS IS WHO HILLRY CLITNESS THEN YOU WONDER WHY REPUBLICANS ARE SO ULLFIERE PIST ABOUT THE DOUBLE STANDARD YOU WANT Y SOM IN Y REPUBLICANS INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ANT EVEN IN N EVEN HANDED ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE LOOKITG SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND WE SAY THIS IS NOT EVEN HANDED ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE OR ANYTHING MOTLY LIKE IT MEANWHILE YOU HAVE LEGAL EXPERTS AN AMIS AN BE SEE CLAIMING THAT RACE IS GOING TO BE A CENTRAL COMPONENT IN TRUMS CHILD TRIAL WHICH IS JUST INSANE TO SAY I MEAN BY E WAY THAT'S TOTALLY CRAZY TIS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT WHETHER DONALD TRUMPE ATTEMPTED TO DENY PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO BOT OR SOME SUCH WHAT IN THE WORLD 'S THIS HAVE TO DO WITH RACE BUT HEREIS A GEORGE STATE UNIVERSITY PROFESSORAN AN MIRICSEEGALL EXPLAINING THAT ACTUALLY RACE IS GOING TO BE THE CENTRAL COMPONENT HERE WITH THAT MANY DEFENDENCE DO YOU THINK THAT THAT EVERY ONE ON THAT LIST IS GOD OWANA E PLAY HARD BALL PROSECUTORS OR HOW LIKELY IS AT THIS SOMEWHOT WOULD WANT A CUT A DEAL I THINKS EXTREMELY LIKELY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A DEO CUT AND I WANT TO MAKE ONE MORE POINT IF I MAY UNLIKE THE OTHER CASES RACE IS GOING TO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THIS CASE IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS WE ALL KNOW DONALD TRUMPETS PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE TO BACK WOMEN THAN Y IS TO OTHER PEOPLE AND A ARE THE FOON COUNTY JERY POOL IS GOING TO BE LARGELY AFRICAN AMERICAN IF ITS TAYS HERE SO I DO THINK THERE'S AN UNDERCURRENT OF RACE IN THIS CASE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THA IS GEORGIA THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE BDIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER THREE CASES I DO EXPECT SOME OF THOSE WITNESSES TO TURN AND TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE PRESS AT RACE IS CAN BE A CENTRAL COMPONENT MY GO DO JUST SAYING THE QUAPART OUT LOUD RIGHT THERE IN MY GOODNESS THIS AGAIN IT'S IT'S SO MUCH OF THIS IS POLITICS NOW SPEAKING OF POLITICS ONE OF BIT QUESTIONS HERE IS WHETHER RE PUBLICANS ARE GOING TO NOMINATE TRUMP IN THEMIDDLE OF ALL THIS AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONAL NEJURC REASH WHICHES NOMINATE HIM  JUST TO SAY SCREW YOU TO THESE PEOPLE BUT YOU MAY BE GIVIN THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT IF JOBINE GETS REELECTED I SAID ON YESTERDAY SHOW I DON'T SEE ONE IODA OF DATA THAT PRESIDENT TRUMS LEGAL TROUBLES ARE HURTING AR OR HURTING HIMIN A PRIMARY OR THAT THEY ARE HELPING HIM IN A GENERAL AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT THE DAY TO SHOW RIGHT NOW TRUM IS A RECORD HIGH LEE IN THE GIOPE PRIMARY POLES APORING FIVE THIRD GETS NATIONAL PLLING AVERAGE O THE PRIMARY TRUM HAS A NEAR RECORD HIGH ADVANTAGE OF THIRTY EIGHT  POINT SEVEN PER CENT OVER FLORA GOVERNOR RONTISSANTIS THAT IS OUT FROM A LEAD OF FIFTEEN TO TPENTY POINTS IN LATE MARCH BUT HI'S FAVORABILITY RATING HAS BEEN FALLING STEADILY AFTER HIS SECOND INDICTMENT IN TERMS OF FAVORABILITY RATING AFTER THE INDICTMENT ON THE HUSH MONEY CHARGES ACGORING TO FIVE THIRTY EIGHT TRUMS NET FAVORABILITY WHICH IS HIS FAVORABILITY RATING MINUS IS ON FAVORABILITY RATING ROSE POINT SEVEN PER CENTAGE POINTS AMONG REPUBLICANS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS HIS JUNE INDICTMENT WAS IFFERENT STORY IN THE TWES AFTER THAT HIS NOT FAVORABILITY RATING FELLW FROM FIFTY SEVEN POINT ONE PER SENT POSITIVE TO FIFTY FIVE POINT THRY PER CENT POSITIVE AND HIS NOT FAVORABILITY RTING MONG ALL IT ELDS FELL FROM ELEVEN POINT NINE PER CENTSAGE POINTS NEGATIVE BACK DOWN TOALMOST FIFTEEN PER CENTSAGE POINTS NEGATIVE SO IT MAY BE WORSE WHEN I COMES TO THE GENERAL ELECTION IMAGIN IN ENTIRE ELECTION CYCLE RUN ENTIRELY ONTONAL TRUMP IN 'LL LOW JOBIDON TO RO RUN THE CAMPAGN HE WANTS HE' GO BACK TO THAT BASEMEN IN REHOBLOTH BEECH DELAWARE HE JUST SIT THERE BY THE WAY IF YOU THINK THAT JOBIDON IS GOING TO DEBATE DONNAL FROM YE ANOTHER THING COMING IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPEN IT'S NEVER EVER GOING TO HAPPEN NUMBER ONE HE HAS THE PRECEDENT OF TRUM NOTTOBATING INSIDE THEIR PUBLICAN PARTY NUMBER TOO HE'S JUST GOING TO SAY I DON'T DEBATE PEOPLE ARE UNDER CRIMINAL INDICTMENT THAT'S ALL HIS GON TO SAY AND THE MEDOR CAN GO RIGHT ALONG WITH IT THAT'S HOW THAT'S CON OR HE'S JUS GONG TO SAY I'M NOT GOING TO BATE SOMEBODY WHO IS IN INSURRECTIONIST AGAINST THE COUNTRY NOW YOU AND I WILL KNOW THAT'S MUNCHOCRAP BUT WILL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT AND IF THERE'S NO DEBATE THEN HOW EXACTLY DOES NONNAL FROM SLAP JOBIDON PARTICULARLY HARD IS THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM WHAT THIS REALTHE AMOUNTS TO I WOULD BETEM DOLLARS TO DONUTS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ACTUALLY HERE IS ASIDE FROM TRUM STRENGTHENING IN THE PRIMARIES IN THE TWOING TWENTY FOUR RACE YOE'RE GOINTO SEE MORE SUPPORT GOING TO THIRD PARTY CANIS LIKE ARFCA JUNIORS AR OFCA JUNIOR SO FAR HAS RUN A PRETTY SMART RACE HONESTLY BUKE HE'S GOING TO ALTERNATIVE MEDIA HE IS SAYING THINGS THAT NOBODY ELSE WILL SAY NOT JUST ABOUT THE AXINE AS BEN OF COURSE ALL SORTS OF COVERADGE OF HIS VAXIN COMMENSON AND WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT COVE N ALL THE REST BUT ARFCA JUNIOR HAS TAKEN PRETTY HEDERADOX POSITIONS ON A WIVE RIETY TISSUES AND HE'S BEEN GOING AFTER JO BY NON INFLATION OUT LET'S FEU REAL ABOUT THIS THE VAST MANTORITY OF AMERICANS CAN MUCH MORE ABOUT THEIR POCKET BOOKS AND ABOUT THE FACT THEY'PAYING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE PER MONTH EVERY MONTH NOW THANKS TO JOBIDON THEN THEY DO ABOUT ANY OF THE LEGAL FLOIBLES THAT ARE CURENTLY TAKEN PLACE IN FULTIN COUNTY TRUMP ISN'T TALKING BOUT THAT'S TAF CAUSE HE CAN'T HOW COULD H YOU UNDERSTAND AT AME US BEING INDITED EVERY COUNTING THE UNITED STATES APPARENLY CAN BRING N INDICTMENT AGAINST TRUMP BUT MEANWHILE OUR F CAJUNIOR IS GOING AFTER BYDING ON INFLATION WHICH IS WHAT NORMAL CANDIDATES WOULD BE DOING THESE DAYS SO THERE'S NO MONEY FOR POOR AMERICANS AND THE PEOPLE THAT I SEE ARE LIVING BECAUSE OF THE INFMATION BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THIS WITH THIS DESPERATION THE AVERAGE WAGE IN THIS CONTRY HIS NOW FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS LAFT LEST AND THE COST OF IM OF BASIC GOODS OF FOOD TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING SO HALF OF AMERICANS OR MAKING UP THAT CAP I PUTTING IT ON THEIR CREDIT CARD BILLS AND THIS WEEK WE PAST ONE POINT ONE TRULION DOLLARS IN CREDICAR AT THAT THE FIRST TIME IN HAS RE MOST OF THT OR THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION THAT HAS BEEN IN THE BY THE TRUMPET MINITRATION TWO MAN AWERE SAYING I AN I I'M HELPING AMERICA THE TRULYA NON CRET CAR TAT AND MOST PEOPLE ARE PAING TWENTY TWO SEN PERCENTE INTREST IF THE MOFFYAD DID THAT IN WOULD BE CALLED LONGSHARKING  HE IS SOTALLY RIGHT ABOUT THIS BAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS HE'S TALKING BAT AN ISSUE THAT WHEN'S LAST TIME YOU HARD A CANDIDATE TALK TAT INFLATION JOBIN ISIN IN TALK ABOUT IS E'S DOING IT BUT DOWN TRUMP ITS IN TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE'S BUSY AND RON SANSIS HASN'T EALY BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT OR IF HE HAS AS BEEN OBSCURED BY THE FACT THAT DOWN TRUMP HAS BEN INVICTED SO THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION FOR THE TWO MANE PARTIES IS NOT ABOUT THE THING THE MOST AMERICANS CAREABOUT WHICH MEANS THERE ACTUALLY IS A LANE NOT FOR OUR F CAJUNIOR BECOME PRESIDENT BUT FOR OUR  CAJUNIOR TO TAKE AWAY A PRE SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTE A SOLIDTHIRD PARTY CANSIATE RIGHT NOW COULD EASILY TAKE TEN PERCENTETOT ON THE A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE CAN WIN ON THINGINGS HE THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE TAKE THIRTY PER CENT OF THE VOT BUT COULD YOU SEE A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE DRALLIC THREE PER CENT OF RE PUBLICANS THREE PER CENT OF DEMOCRATS AND FOR PER CENTIMENTAL I DON'T SEE WHY NOT AND THEN THE SELECTION REALLY IS UP IN THE AIR DESPITE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS GOING ON AGAIN OUR F CA IS THE ONLY PERSON WHOS TALKING ABOUT ISSUES RIGHT NOW THAT THING MOST AMERICANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT I THING THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEPONIZATION OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT I ALSO THINK THE DOWN TRUMP ISTHE MOST POLITICIZED FIGURE OF OUR LIFETIME BARNON SO MOST AMERICANS AGAIN AND I THINK RIGHTLY OUR CON CERN MORE ABOUT HOW THEY PUT DINNER ON THE TABLE THEN THE ARE CONCERN ABOUT FANNY WILLIS AND THE DETAILS OF THE RECO ACT AGAIN JUST ONE SECOND WE'LL GET TO THE FACT THAT CREDICAR DELINQUENCIES ARE  JUMPING FIRST LET'S TALK

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN OSCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO FOR  VII MENDER HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR SARA GOTFRED DOCTOR SERA GOTFREED IS AN OBSTETRITIAN GONACOLOGIST WHO DID HER UNDERGRADUATE TRAINING IN BYOENGINEERING AT THE UNIVERSIY OF WASHINGTON AND SEATL SHE THEN COMPLETED HER MEDICAL TRAINING AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND SHE CURRENTLY IS A CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF INEGRATIVE MEDICINE AND NUTRITIONAL SCIENCES AT THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY SHE IS ALSO BEEN AT COLINITION TREATING MEN AND WOMEN IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HORMONE HEALTH AND LONGEVITY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS SHE IS AN EXPERT IN NOT JUST TRADITIONAL MEDICINE AS IT RELATES TO HORMONES AND FERTILITY BUT ALSO NUTRITIONAL PRACTICES SUPPLEMENTATION AND BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES AND COMBINING ALL OF THAT EXPERTIES IN ORDER TO HELP WOMEN NAVIGATE EVERY ASPECT AND DIMENTION OF THEIR HORMONES LONGEVITY AND VITALITY RANGING FROM PUBERTY TO YOUNG ADULTHOOD ADULTHOOD PERRY MENAPAUS AND MENAPAUS AND NOWDAYS SHUES ALSO TREATING MEN ACROSS THE LIFE SPAND IN TERMS OF LONGEVITY VITALITY AND HORMONE HEALTH DURING TO DAYS DISCUSSION DOCTOR GOTFREY SHARES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND TOOLS THAT WOMEN CAN APPLY TOWARD THEIR HORMONE HEALTH FOR TILITY VITALITY AND LONGEVITY WE DISCUSS THE GOT MICROBIOM WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE HURD ABOUT BUT DOCTOR GOTFREY POINTS OUT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT WOMEN HAVE IN TERMS OF MANAGING THEIR GUPMICROBIOM AND THE WAYS THAT THAT INFLUENCES THINGS LIKE ESTERGEN LEVELS AND MATABOLISM TO STOSTERON THIROID AND GROWTH HORMONE AND MUCH MORE WE ALSO DISCUSSE NUTRITION AND EXERCISE WE TOUCH ON HOW THE OMEGATHREE FATIACIDS PLAY A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANAGING FEMALE HORMON HEALTH DOCTOR GOTFRED POINTS OUT WHY WOMEN HAVE PARTICULAR NEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS AND HOW BEST TO OBTAIN THOSE ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS FOR HORMONE HEALTH WE ALSO DISCUSS EXERCISE AND SHE OFFER SOME SURPRISING INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPES AND RATIOES OF RESISTANCE TRAINING TO CARDIOVASCULATRAINING THAT WOMEN OUGHT TO USE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THEIR HORMONE HEALTH WE ALSO TALK A LOT ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM THIS WAS A SURPRISING ASPECT OF THE CONVERSATION I DID NOT ANTICIPATE DOCTOR GOTFRED SHARED WITH US FOR INSTANCE THAT WOMEN SUFFER FROM DIGESTIVE ISSUES AT MORE THAN TEN TIMES THE FREQUENCY THAT DO MEN AND FORTUNATELY THAT THERE ARE TOOLS SPECIFIC TO WOMEN THAT THEY CAN USE IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THOSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES AND THAT IN OVERCOMING THOSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES THEY CAN OVERCOME MANY OF THE RELATED HORMONE ISSUES THAT SO MANY WOMEN FACE DOCTOR GOTFREED ALSO SHARES WITH OU TREMENDOUS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF TESTS NOTJOUS BLOOD TESTS BUT ALSO URINE AND MICROBIOM TESTS THAT WOMEN CAN USE IN ORDER TO REALLY GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR HORMONE STATUS NOTJHUST OFH PRESENT BUT ALSO WERE THE TRAGECTY OF THEIR HORMONES IS TAKING THEM SO WE HAVE AN NAVA DISCUSSION ABOUT PUBERTY ABOUT YOUNG ADULTHOOD ADULTHOOD PERRY MENAPAUS AND HOWBEST TO MANAGE AND NAVIGATE PERRYMENAPAUS AND MENAP AWS INCLUDING A DISCUSSION ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY IN ADDITION TOOUR ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL LEXPERTIESE DOCTOR GOTFREED HAS AUTHORED MANY IMPORTANT BOOKS ON NEUTRITION HORMONES AND SUPPLEMENTATION AS IT RELATES TO WOMEN AND TO PEOPLE GENERALLY THE TWO BOOKS THAT I'D LIKE TH HIGHLET AND THAT WE PROVIDED LINKS TO IN THE SHONOTE CAPTIONS ARE WOMEN FOOD AND HORMONES AND THE HORMON CURE I READ THE HORMONE CURE AND FOUND IT TO BE TREMENDOUSLY INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE NOT JUST IN TERMS OF TEACHING ME ABOUT FEMALE HORMONE HEALTH AND VARIOUS TREATMENTS FOR FEMALE HORMON HEALTH BUT ALSO AS A MAN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE ENDICRANE SYSTEM INTERACTS WITH MIND SET NUTRICIAN AND SUPPLEMENTATION MORE GENERALLY SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE HORMONE CURE FOR ANYBODY INTERESTED IN HORMONES IN HORMON HEALTH AND WOMEN FOOD AND HORMONES IN PARTICULAR FOR WOMEN ALTHOUGH AGAIN BOTH BOOKS ARE GOING TO BE STRONGLY INFORMATIVE FOR WOMEN WISHING TO OPTIMIZE THEIR HORMON HEALTH VITALITY AND LONGEVITY BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHYSITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANTS ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK T ELECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDERMILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRSTHING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR SARA GOTFREED DOCTOR GOTFREED SARA WELCOME THANK YOU SO HAPPY TO BE HERE I'M DELIGHTED AND VERYSIHT TO ASK YOU ABOUT AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF TOPICS ERO ARE EXPERT IN SO SO MANY THING SO I THE CHALLENGE FOR ME IS GOING TO BE TO CONTRAIN THIS WALK AS IT WERE I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN TOUCH ON AN GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS TO DAY THE FIRST OF WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT HORMONS AND FEMALE HORMONS IN PARTICULAR AND I HAVE A QUESTION WHICH IS IS IT EVER IN FORMATIVE FOR A WOMAN REGARDLESS OF AGE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HER MOTHERS PERHAPS EVEN HER GRANDMOTHERS EXPERIENCE OVES OF E HOR MONS NOT JUST PREGNANCY CHALLENGE IS WITH OR AM EASE WITH PREGNANCY AND CHILD REARING CHILD BIRTH THIS SORT OF THING BUT YOU WHAT SORTS OF CONVERSATIONS SHOULD WOMEN BE HAVING WITH THEMSELVES AND WITH FAMILY MEMBERS TO GET A WINDOW INTO WHAT THER SPECIFIC NEEDS MIGHT BE W OF THES QUESTION SO MY WORK IS REALLY UP INTERFACE BETWEEN CENETICS AND ENVIRONMENT SO YOUR QUESTION GETS TO BOTH AND I THINK IT'S E SENTIAL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YURE GRANDMOTHER WENT THROUGH I'D EVEN SAY YOUR GREAT GRANDMOTHER DEPENDING ON LONCH EPOTY IN YOUR FAMILY SO I GROW UP WITH MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER I GET THAT AND ESPECIALLY YOUR MOTHER SO I WOULD PROBABLY START FIRST WITH TRAMA AN ENERGENERATIONAL TRAMA BECAUSE I THINK THAT OF FACTS AND O PRIM SYSTEM SO HUGELY SPECIALLY CORTISAL SIGNALING BUT THE BROADER PINE SYSTEM PSYCHOM YOU KNOW NERROW ENDTICRAN SYSTEM AND THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW IF I THINK ABOUT THE STAGE IS THE LIFE CYCHLE THAT A WOMEN GOES THROUGH IF YOU THINK ABOUT PUBERITY I THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW GENETICALLY DETERMINED THE AGE OF PUBRITYIS CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES LIKE TOXINS CAN AFFECT IT BUT AM PREGNENCY THE AGE AT WHICH YOU CTART TO GO THROUGH PERY MENAPOS MENAPAS MANY OF THOSE HAVE A GENETIC COMPONENT SO WOULD PREGNAN SYMEN YOU CAN CERTAINLY THINK THE SHAPE OF THE BELVIS YOUR ABILITY THE AB OFATIONAL BIRTH SOE ABOUT IS ENECALLY TERMINE I MAN YOU DO HAVE YOU KNOW THE THE FIRM DOWNER AFFECTING SOME OF THAT BUT YOU KNOW ON MY FAMILY FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE NO CECERIAN SECTIONS SO EVERY ONE GOES THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF A RELATIVELY EAS VATIONALWORTH I WAS A FOR A SUPS BABY BUT YOU KNOW FOR THE MOST PART AM YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THAT AND THEN THERE'S CERTAIN FEMALE CONDITIONS THATD HAVE AT VERY STRONG COMPONENT GENETICALLY MOST OF WHICH RUN ON MY FAMILY SO THAT INCLUDES ENDEMETRIOSIS FIBRATES I JUST HADI ISTRACT ME I HADA FIFTY PLUS FIPRATES AND A POLISYSTIC OVARIANT INTREM AND OF THOSE THREE HOW FREQUENT ARE THOSE AND A MAYBE I CAN CONSTRAIN THE QUESTION LABIT BY SAYING AM TO DAY'S DISCUSSION I IMAGINES CAN BE HEARD BY MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL SORTS OF AGES SO I A MAYBE ELL DIRECT THE QUESTION LITTLE BIT TOWARD YOU KNOW AT WHAT AGE SHOULD THESE DISCUSSIONS START AM YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS IMAGINE THAT A WOMEN IN THERE A THIRTIES AND FORTIES AND FIFTIES AND ONWARD SHOUD BE GETTING CERTAIN TESTS AND  A ADDRESSING THINGS LIKE A VERYING RESERVE AND AND OTHER SORTS OF THINGS BUT YOU KNOW MAY WE COULD MARCH THROUGH D JUST SAY FOR A WOMAN IN HER TEANS WHO'S ALREADY HIT PUBERTY WHAT SORTS OF BILE MARKERS WHETHER NOT THEIR BLOOD BASE OR PER OR ON FENATYPING YOU KNOW THAT TH THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF SHOULD THOSE YOUNG WOMEN BE PAYING ATTENTION TO LIKEWISE FOR WOMAN IN THEIR TWENTY THIRTIES MAYBE E COULD TAKE IT AN MORE LESS BY BY DECADE A STORTING AT PUBERTY ASSUMING THAT WOMAN HITS PUBERTY SOMETIME WHAT BETWEEN WHAT IS IT NOW THE AVERAGE IN THE USI SOMEWERE BETWEEN TWELVE AND SIXTEEN YEARS OLD O I HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW YOU DO NOT O THAT AS TO BE RA O SO IT USED TO BE TWELVE TO SIXTEEN I WOULD SAY FIFTY YEARS AGO IT'S BEEN MOVING YOUNGER AND WE THANK SOME OF THAT IS REALLATED TO TOKAN EXPOSURE AS I MENTIONED BUT I WAS TEN WHEN I WENT THROUGH PUBERTY SO A WHY SHOULD SAY MENARCHY AND I ASSERTED GROWING BRAS MUCH BEFORE THAT SO I THINK NOW I'M GOING TO STEP AWAY FROM THE SCIENCE FOR A MOMENT I'MN A DO THAT PRETTY FLUIDLY AND I'LL TRY TO CALL IT OUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO A HUGE INFLUENCE FROM STRESS AND LIKE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATRENAL GLANCE SO GOING BACK TO THE SCIENCE THE IS SUE IN TEENAGE YEARS IS THAT THE HYPOTHLAMIC PETUITARY A DREANAL AXIS AND I LIKE TO THINK OF IT BROGTER SO STAY WITH ME HYPOTHYLAMIC PETUITARY A DREANAL GHE NATLE OF RECENT WOMEN TESTIS MEN THIRIGT GOT AXES SO THAT TO ME IS THE CONTROL SYSTEM SOME CANNO EXPRESSING MY BIOENGINEERINSIDE HERE WI THINK IT'S GREAT TO INCLUDE THE OTHER ORGANS IN TISSUE SYSTEMS OF THE BODY BECAUSE AS WE BOTH KNOW THAT THE NARROW DEFINITION OF JUST HYPOT THE LAMP PETUITARIA DREAMAL IT CAN'T BE JUST THAT I NOW I CAN'T O NO IT DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY SO IF YOU LOOK AT THO THE MAN PSEXWORMONS IN A A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE INTERTEENA YEARS THE HYPOTHLAMIC PETUITRY A DREAN'LL GANATL PART OF THAT IS NOT FULLY MATURE SO THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO SKET PERIODS ESPECIALLY UNDER STRESS THEY HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCEIS IT REALLY DOESN'T GET WELL ESTABLISHED UNTILL YOU'RE DONE WITHOTUT LESSONS AND I'M TOLD THAT ATOLA SINCE NOW AS TILL LIK AGE TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY SIX I HEARD THAT KNOWS LIKE I'VE GOT TWO DAUGHTERS NI WAS IT'S A REALLY LO APSYCHOLOGICALLY DEFINED OR BIOSI SYCESSOTUALLY MOSTLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY TO FIND I HEARD THAT FROM A PSYCHOLOGIS SO BIO MARKERS YOU ASKED ABOUT IN YOUR TENATEARS WHAT I THINK  IS REALLY INTERESTING IS TO LOOK AT CARTICE ALL TO LOOK AT THE DANCE BETWEEN ESTERTON AN PROJESTRON IN THOSE YEARS IS LESS HELPFUL BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF VERY ILITY DUE TO THE IMMATURITY OF THE SYSTEM IF YOU'VE GOVTE SOMEONE HAS GOT REALLY REGULAR PERIODES IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO DO SOME BENCH MARKING AT THAT AGE BUT GENERALLY AFFIND THAT BENCH MARKING IS BEST PERFORMED IN YOUR TWENTY OR THIRTIES OUR PERIODS NOT THAT REGULAR IN TERMS OF DURATION OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHEN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE FIRST SETS IN IT DEPENDS SO I WAS LIKE CLOCKWORK EVERY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS UNTIL I AD MA HAS DIRECT ME AN AUGUST SAME THING WITH MY DAUGHTERS I'VE GOT TWO DAUGHTERS ONE SEVENTEEN THE OTHERS TWENTY THREE FOR A LOT OF WOMEN THEY'RE NOT REGULAR AND THEN THERE'S THE WHOLE PIECE OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES AND OTHER FORMS OF CONTRACEPTION WHERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE NORMAL CYCLE IS AND I HOPE WE'LL HAVE SOME TIME TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THIS IS NOW OPINION AGAIN AND NOT SCIENCE I THINK IT IS THE NIMBER ONE AND A CHRONOPATHY THAT IS I ATROGENIC FOR WOMEN WE WILL DEAFULLY TALK ABOUT I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ORL CONTRACEPTIVES IM IN THE SOCIAL MEDEA SPACE AND ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT I UDIES QUITE A LOT TOTALLY THAN PARTICULAR COPPERIUDIS NO GOT ON HARMONALIUTY SO ITWELL DEFFLING TOUCH ON THAT I AN I UDE CRUSATER SO I JUST ONE AT YOU KNOW GIVE YOU THAT WORNING YOUAR YOUR A FAN TO I HAVE THAT RIGHT OR YOR ANTI I AM A HUGE FAN IT W WHICH I UDES IN PARTICULAR SO I LIKE COPPER BECAUS IT'S NON HORMONAL IT'S AS EFFECTIVE AS GETTING YOUR TUBESTIDE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT RIGHT MAN IT'S THAT TOXIC TO THE SPERM MOBILITY IS AT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF IS THAT AT IT THAT IT BASICALLY IT'S LIKE A IT AS MORE LESS AN ELECTRIC FENCE TO THE SPIRM CAP AND JUST THATS IT ELECTRIC FENCE IS A BIT OF A HARSH ANOLOGY BUT A'LL WORK WITHAT BUT IT'S YOU KOW TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT CAN LAST FOR TEN YEARS SO THAT YOU REALLY HAVE COMPLETE ATONOMY AND SOVEREIGNTY OVER YOUR SECUAL LIFE THAT'S PROFOUND AND'S NOT GET ALL THOSE DOWNSTREAM RIS THERE ASISATED WITH BIRTH CONTROLPILE THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT I KNOW THE SACYPLER WOMEN WHO USE THE COPPERAUTY HAVE THE HIGHEST SATISFACTIONRY OF ANY ONE ON CONTRACEPTIVES THE HIGHEST SATISFACTIONRY AND YET IT IS THE LEAST USED OF ALL FORMS OF CONTRASFACTION NOW MY FAVORITE IS VE SACTOMY BUT SHORT OF THE SECTOME I THINK THA IDEAS EARLY GREAT CHOICE THERE ARE SOME RIISISY WITH IT I'M NOT SAYING ITS RIS FREE BUT I LOVE THE IDE AND I LOVE IT FOR YOUNGER WOMEN TOO CAUSE IT USED TO BE THAT WHEN I WENT THROUGH MY TRAINING WHICH WAS THIRTY YEARS S AGO WE WERE TOLD YOU KNOW DON'T PUT IT IN SOME ONE WHO ASK ANOT A BABY AND THAT IS PATRRICAL MESSAGING BUT GETTING BACK TO Y ORIGINAL QUESTION WHICH IS ABOUT BIO MARKERS PRODECTATE IN YOUR TWENTIES THAT'S WHEN YOU WANTED TO SOM BAS CASING WITH ESTERGEN PROGESTORON INTOSTOCEROM SO THEY GETS REALLY HELPFUL TO KNOW ABOUT THIS THE STANGO YOU'RE FROM ARGENTINA R YOUR FITE HAV  SERGEANTINE LINEAGE YES MY GRANDPARENTS TO TANGO INTO THEIR LATE ADIES  I M I'M IN MY LATE FORTIES AND I I STILL HAVEN'T STARTED SO I SUPOSE THEIR'S TIME IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR YO TO G AND IT MIGHT BE A FACTOR IN THEIR LONCEVITY DID THEY'VE GOOD HELSPAN NOT IS IS AND AND MY GRANDFATHER SMOKE CIGARETTES DAILY REMAINED MENTALLY SHARP UNTIL HE DIED IN HIS LATE NINETIES BUT UM ALMOST BURNED DOWN THEIR APARTMENT SEVERAL TIMES FALLING ASLEE WITH A CIGARET IN HIS MOUTH SO I DON'T RECOMMEND ANY ONE BUT  AH BUT IT WAS A COFFEE MATA A RED MEAT AND CIGARETTES AND THY LIVED INTO THEIR NINETY SO THAT'S HIWDO MY FAMILY HAS THE GENETIC A ADVANTAGE THE OTHER SIDE LESS SO  BUT IN ANY EVENT A TANGO UM RANKO IS IT IS A TWENTY TWENTY THREE GOAL IT HAS BEEN EVERY YEAR A THE A I'M AT ALWHOLD O ACCOUNTABLE THAT WILL DO AN THEN KNOW THERE WILL BE NO UTUVIDIO OF ME DOING AT LEAS NOT INITIALLY TIMPHARIS ACTUALLY A PHENOMENAL PONCASTER AS WE KNOW IS A HES A BT AS ESA TAT ASTANGO PTANGOD ANSER I KNOW THIS THROUGH VARIOUS SOURCES YES YO I'VE SEEN YES SO THIS TANGO BETWEEN USTRAN PROGESSOR AND US INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YOU WANT TO HAVE THE THE RIGHT LEAD YOU ONT HAVE THE RIGHT FOLLOW BETWEEN THE TWO WARMONS AGAIN I'M SEPPING AWAY FROM MY SCIENCE HATIN BUT WHAT HAPPENS A LOT OF THE TIME IS THAT ESTERGEN DOMINATES IN THAT TANGO AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT SETS YOU AT FOR GREATER RISK OF FIBRIDES ENEMITRIASIS BRESPAN PROBABLY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MICROBIOM IN THE A STROBALOM CAN YOUVE FAMILIARIZE METHEA STROBLOUM YE IM DELI YONT T KNOW THAT I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE TERM YE SO THE ISTROUBLELOM IS THE SET OF MICROBES IN AND THEIR DEANE THEYR DEANAOSLY IN THE GUT MICROBIUM THAT'S SET OF MI CREPS IN THEIR DENI SO IT'S IN THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOTALITY THE SUBSET OF PARTICULAR BACTERIA MOGULATE ESTRGAN LEVELS SO A LOT OFS WORK WAS SPIRIETTED BY MARTIN PLACER AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE ARE SOME WOMEN WHO HAVE IN A STROBLEOM THAT MAKES THOME HAVE A GREATER RISK OF SERTAIN ESTERGEN MEDIATED CONDITIONS LIKE BRES CANCER ENEMETRO CANCR AN AMEN PROSTATE IANCER SO THE ISTROBLEM IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ATTENTION PAID TO IT BUT I ALWAYS THINK IN TERMS OF MY PATIENCE UNO COULD THIS BE SOME ONE WHO'S GOT A FAULTY A STROBALOM AND WE NEED TO ADJESTIT WITH YOU KNOW SOME OF THE MICHRO BIOM A MODULATING A NEU TRANTE NEUTRACITICALS THAT WE HAVE SO THAT THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THAT THAT TANGO THAT'S NOT WORKING WITH ESTERGON PROTESTORAM SO GETTING BACK TO THE MITEMARKERS IF IF YOU GAVE ME AN UNLIMITED BUDGIT WHICH I KIND OF HAVE WITH SOME OF MY A CLANTS THAT I WORK WITH NOW WHAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW IS ESTERGON PROGESTERAN TESTOSTRON AND I WANT THE TIMING RIGHT FOR THAT I'D WANT TO KNOW ABOUT D CER AND SORT OF THE WHOLE INTRESIN PATHWAY I'D WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE METABOLITES OF ESTERSON BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE PROTECTIVE AND VERY HELPFUL IOTHERS ARE A BIT LIKE HOMER SIMPSON I'M IN THEY ARE JUST LIKE COSTING ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS IN YOUR BODY INCREASING THE RISK OF QUENNONS LIKE DE ANA DAMAGE AND POTENTIALLY AN INCREASE RISK A BRAS CANCER ALTHOUGH THAT DATA I THINK IS MIXET I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR STOOL SO I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MICROBIAM SO THE BEST THO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS TO LOOK A WHEN WE DO STOOL TESTIAN I DO A LOT OF STOOL TESTING WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS LIKE BATEA GLUCRONIDAS ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH BC AM FAMILIAR WITH IT AS A TERM AND SO FOR THOSE LISTENING IT VERY OFTEN NOT ALWAYS WHEN YOU HEAR IN A SA S YOUR DEALING WITH AN ENDSIM SO I CAN E TAKE A STAVE THERE IN AN IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN A GLUCLOS MATABOLISM OF SOME SORT ERS CLICCEGRONIDATION SO IT'S INVOLVED IN WHEN YOU PRODUCE ESTERGON THE BODY THIS IS LIKE THE  SIMPLIFIED FERS AN BUT WHEN YOU PRODUCE ESTERGON YOU ARE MENT TO USE IT LIKE SENDED TO THE RECEPTORS WHERE IT'S MEANT TO GO AND THEN LOSE IT LIKE YOU DN'T WANT TO KEEP ARECIRCULATING T ESTERGON LIKE BAD CARMA AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGH BLAT A BATA LICRONIDAS SO IT'S THI ENDSIM THAT'S PRODUCED BY THREE BACTARY IN PARTICULAR IN THAT AND I SEE A LOT OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE ELEVATED BATIC LICRONIDAS AND THEN THEY HAVE SOME ESTERSEN DOMINANTS RELATED TO THAT IS THAT THE TOTAL REASON WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT IT'S ONE OF THE DRIVERS IT'S ONE OF THE LEVERS AND IT CAN BE DETECTED FROM A MICROBYUM A CSE STOOL SAMPLE THAT'S RIGHT AND IN TERMS OF BLOOD TESTING OR VERYS TEST FOR THESE OTHER BILE MARKERS GETTING ESTERGEN TESTOSTRONE AND OTHER RATIOS I REALIZE THEYARE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT MEANS FINANCIAL MEANS BUT IN GENERAL PEOPLE WANTING TO DO A BLOODTEST IT SOUND LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO IT WHAT WOMEN WILL NEED TO DO IT AT DIFFERENT STAGES OFTHER MENSTRUAL CYCLE IF THEY HAD TO PICK ONE YOU KNOW EITHER IN THE FELICULAR PASE AN WERE IN THE LUDIAL STAGE OF THEIR O VERIAN MENSTRUAL CYCLE A SUSE ME OVULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHEN WOULD YOU SUGGEST THEY DO THAT IF TEY HAD TO PICK SO IF YOU FORCE ME TO PICK ONE I WOULD SAY PROBABLY DAY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWO FOR SOME ONE IN OUR TWENTIES SO WERE FOCUS RIGHT NOW ON THAT DECADE SO FOR MOST WOMEN THEY'VE GOT A MENSTRUAL CYCHOLD DAY THAT AVERAGE IS OUT AT TWENTY DAYS SO THIS IS ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THEY START THEIR PERIOD FOR WOMEN ARE MORE IRREGULAR IT'S HARDER TO DO THAT AS WOMEN GET OLDER AND WEILL TALK ABOUT THIS IN A MOMENT USUALLY THE CYCLE GETS A LITTLE SHORTER SO AS THEY START TO DECLINE IN THEIR PROGESTORON PRODUCTION THE APPERIO GETS A LITTLE CLOSER TOGETHER LIKE MINE BEFORE AUGUST WAS ABOUT EVERY TWENTY SIX DAYS SO AT THAT POINT YOU WANT A TAS SOONER LIKE DAY NINETEEN TWENTY AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BLOOD TUSTS A BLOOD TEST IS THE CEAPEST THING ITS USUALLY WHAT'S COVERED BY INTURANCE BUT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO DO DRIED URIN I LIKE TO USE SOLIVA FOR QUART US ALL I LIKE TO USE TRIDE YOUR IN SO THAT I GET METABOLOMIX IN ADDITION TO THE LEVELS OF THESE FOREMONS AND IF I'M FORCE TO ALL USE BLOOD TESTING AND THAT' CERTAINLY THE GOLD STANDARD FOR ALL OF THESE FORMONTS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT A IT'S NOT AS COMPREHENSIVE AND AS YOU KNOW IT'S A QUICK LITTLE SNAP SHOT WHILE THE NEEDLES IN YOUR VEIN FOR NOW THIRTY SECONDS YET THE SELIVERY CARTIS ALMAK SENTS TO ME CAS MY ENERCINS YOU GET FREE QUARTERS ALL WHICH IS THE ACT OF THAT AS ALL YOU SAID WITH YOURAN YOUR ALSO GETTING THE METABOLITES THAT'S RIGHT AND THEN ON FOR BLOOD TESTING YOUR GETTING IT SORT OF A CRUDE WINDOW INTO THE AVERAGEUS A STATIC TOTAL LEVEL SO A LET ME GO BACK AND SAY ONE OTHER THING ABOUT BYT MARKERS A BIG PART OF THE TESTING THAT I DO IN FENITYPING MY PATIENCE I PRACTISE PERSITION MEDICINE SI I LIKE TO ALMOST START WITH NUTRITIONAL TESTING I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD A TEA NATURE I'VE GOT SOME AN BE PLAYERS THAT ARE NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO MAY BE THOSE COUNT BUT O THIS EREMEN OBVIOUSLY BUT FOR NUTRITIONAL TESTING THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY A HELPFUL THING TO DO IN YOUR TWENTIES BUT COMES LESS IMPORTANT AS YOU GET OLDER AND YOU DEVELOP MORE MICER NUTRIEN DEFICIENCIES BUT MYCERNUTRIANS PLAY UTEROLL IN TERMS FORMAN PRODUCTION MAGNESIUM  THE MAGNSIUM AS USUALLY INVOLVED IN THE WAY THE TO GET RID OF ESTERGAN ASTIN EXAMPLE SO MICERNUTRIANTESTING WHAT I USUALLY DO IS A COMMONATION OF BLOOD IN URIN AND SOM LOOKING AT ALL OF THE MICHERONUTRIANCE THAT WE CAN MEASURE THAT HAVE SOME CLINICAL SCIENTIFIC BASIS PINE THEM IF I COULD DO THAT FOR A EENATURE I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL BECAUSE I RECENTLY GAVE A LECTURE ON BRES CANTSAR RIS RODUCTION ANOTHER QUICKCYPER AND I WAS SAD TO FIND THAT AND TAKE A VEGETABLES POLLYPHENALS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR A FUTURE RISCOBRASQ HANCER LIKE WHEN YOU 'RE FIFTY SIXTY PLUS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME IS WHEN YOU'RE A TEANEATOR NOW I'VE ONE DAUGHTR THAT EATS VEGETABLES SHE LOVES THEM AND I'VE ANOTHER DAUGHTER WHO EATS FOOD THAT'S BASE AND IT'S VERY HARD TO GETTHER TO EAT THE VOLUME AF VEGETABLES YOU KNOW FIVE COLORS A DAY WHICH IS WHAT I DO AND IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT SHEU COULD SHOW A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD THAT THEY'VE GOT MICRENE TREENT GAPS I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MOTIVATOR FOR THEM TO EAT DIFFERENTLY AT A TIME WHEN IT'S SO CRITICAL EVEN THOUGH IT'S YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE THAT IT'S CON A POTENTIALLY CHANGE THIS ARK THAT THEY'REON WOULD YOU DO FOR A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DOESN'T LIKE VEGETABLES IS OR IS NOT SOMEHOW ABLE OR WILLING TO TO GET THOSE FIVE COLORS A DAY OF VEGETABLE TO HELP SUPPORT THET MICROBION E AR SUPPLEMENTS A A USEFUL TOOL IN THAT CASE ON WHAT OTHER SORTS OF TOOLS BEHAVIOUROR OTHERWISE OR USEFUL SUCH A GOOD QUESTION SO HERE A MINUTE IN VOK ROP NIGHT AT USESTY SO I THINK HIS IS A HIS GOT PROJECT HAS REALLY BEEN HELPFUL IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT CAN OMODULATORS ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT SO WHAT I TRY TO GET THAT PERSONOOTIAL AND I DON'T SEE MANY TEANS ANY MORE OTHER THAN AND BE PLAYRS WHAT I TRY TO GET THEM TO DO AS T AV A SMOOTHY VERY HARD TO GET THEM DAFV A SMOOTHY EVERY DAY BUT IF I COULD GET THEM DAFF A SMOOTHY THREE TIMES A WEEK AND O THROW SOME OF THESE VEGETABLES IN THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE MAY WE KNOW THAT MAKES DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF MICROBIOM CHANGE TO TO BE A BLENDING UP BROCKLY OR CALE CAL FLOWERS O CALL FLOWERS PARSHEN THEIR PUTTING THINGS INTO THE SMOOTHY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET A TEANATURE TO DO THAT BUT THEY OFTEN WILL USE LIKE I HAVE THEM DO STEAM BROCKLY THAT'S IN THE FREE SIR BECAUSE IT'S GOT VERY LITTLE TASTE SO THAT THEY COULD DO THAT IN A CHOCOLATE SMOOTHY THEY CAT ADD SOME GREENS I LIKE GREENS POWDERS ARE RESUPERCONVENIENT SO THAT WITH YOU KNOW CAN HAVE A A TASTE THAT THEY LIKE WHETHER THAT'S CHOCOLATE WHICH IS WHAT MOST MY CLIENTS WANT OR YOU KNOW VINILA WITH BARRIES IN THAT SORT OF THING SO TH I CAN GO A LONG WAY IF YOU DON'T LIKE VEGETABLES AND SHORT OF THAT I WOULD SAY SOME SUPPLEMENTS BUT I WOULD SAY THAT'S IDISTANT SECOND TO MAKING A SMOOTHY I'VE GOT ONE PATIENT THAT I HAVE TO MENTION BECAUSE AM HE TOOK THIS TO THE EXTREME SO HE'S A RETIRED THISSIS PROFESSOR YOU S ESTY HE FOUND OUT THAT HIS MCRO BOM WAS A HOT MAS AND AM DEVELOPED OT OF MUTICEES AND SO HE BECAME HELLBENT LIKE ONLY APHYSICIS COULD ON CHANGING AS MICROBIOM AND HE DRAMATICALLY SHIFTED IT BY HAVING A SMOOTHY EVERY DAY A WITH FIFTY SEVEN VEGETABLES IN FRITS SIFTY SEVEN IN N DEPENDENT FIFTY SEVEN INDEPENDENT SO I MEAN THIS JUST WARMS MY HEART THE WAY THAT HE DO THIS BUT HE WOULD GO TO THE FARMER SMARGET HE WOULD JUST GET A BUNCH O THIS A BUNCH OF THAT AND HE WOULD GO HOME MAKE THE SMOOTY AND THEN STICK IT IN THE FREEZIR SO HE'D HAVE A SERVING EVERY DAY AND HE BECAME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON BES ON IS MICROBIUM CHANGE HIS A OT O MEAN DISEASE IS IN REMISSION HE UM HE DROPPED A HUGE MOUNT  WI HE WENT FROM BEING IN A KIND OF H SPHENATYPE THAT I KNOW YOU KNOW WELL OF A PROFESSOR HI PERFORMING TRAVELLING ROUND THE WORLD ON SO MANY BOARDS SO MUCH INNOVATION SO MANY GREAT IDEAS SUPERCOMPUTRIDI TO BEIN SOME ONE WHO GETS UP IN THE MORNING GETS IN IS HOT TO EXERCISS FOR LIKE ONE TO TWO HOURS A DAY AND THEN DOES A LITTLE WORK WY HE COMPLETELY SHIFTED THE WAY THAT HE LIVES AND IS MICROBIUM SHIFT  NOW WHO KNOWS WHAT WHAT'S THE CHICKEN AN WI WHATS SAG THERE BUT HE HAD A HUGE CHANGE IN HIS PHYSIOLOGY GLUCOS WENT FROM BEING QUITE HIGH HE HAD AND HE TRACKS ALL OF IS OF CORSE ITS LIKE ON TIMES HE'S THAT AFTER ALL RITA THEN RETIRED I SUPPOSE MIGHT HAVE HAD AND HE'S RETIRED BUT HE'S HE'S GOT THE LONGEST TIME SERIES OF ANY ONE I KNOW AND HE'S TRACT HIS GLUCOS AN INSOLAND GOING BACK TWENTY YEARS SO HE CAN SHOW YOU OGE HERES WHERE I SARTED HAVING MY SMOOTY AND HERE'S HOW MY GLUCOS AN INSOLAND CHANGE AS RESOLAT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITAMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL F YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARTY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH I GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MEAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS ANATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VIEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE RIGHPT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRYATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREN SDOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL IVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIND THAT'S ATHLETIC GREENSDOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITHIM IND THREE K TO IS THERE CASE FOR I'LL SAY YOUNG WOMEN BUT YOUNG WOMEN AN MEN A USING OVER THE COUNTER PROBIOTICS AS A WAY TO ENHANCE THEM MICHROBUM THIS IS SOMETHING I HEAR ABOUT A LOT I'VE HEARD THAT EXCESSIVE DOSES OF CAPSIL PROBIOTICS CAN GIVE A BRAIN FOG LIKE CONDITION UM I PERSONALLY DON'T USE CAPSIL PROBIOTICS UNLESS I FEEL LIKE MY SYSTEMS UNDER  SIGNIFICANT MOUNTOSTRAS IN WHICH CASE I MIGHT AT THAT IN FOR BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME WER IF I'VE JUST TAKEN INTO BIOTICS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME A DO YOU EVER RECOMMEND THAT THE COLLEGE STUDENT OR THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT THAT SHE OR HE TAKE CAPSIL PROBIOTICS ASSUMING THAT THE'RE GETTING LET' SAY THREE TO FIVE SERVINGS OF VEGETABLES PER DAY EITHER IN SMOOTHY FORM OR SOME OTHER FORM WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON SUPPLEMENTING PROBIOTICS IT SOUNDS LIKE SUCH A SIMPLE QUESTION IT IS SUCH A COMPLEX ANSWER AND I DON'T THINK WE REALLY HAVE THE ANSWER SO I'LL ELL YOU THE WAY THAT I PREACH IT I LOOK FOR RANAMIZES TRIALS TO SUPPORT MY USE OF PROBATICS ND FRANKLY I'M UNDERWHELMED SO I'VE SEEN SOME DATA IF I INVOKE MY A AND BE PLAYERS FOR A MOMENT ALMOST EVERY PLAYER I'VE TESTED HAS INCREASE IN TESTINAL PERMUBILITY THEY JUST HAVE SUCH A HIGH TRAINING LOAD PROBABLY MEETO ATO BY CORTUS ALL VERY IGLUCOSIS WHENNATRAIN THAT THEY HAVE INCREASED IN TESTINAL PIRMABILITY SO THERE'S TIGHT JUNCTIONS IN THEIR IN TESTON BECOME LOOSE THEY DID ALP A LOT OF INFLAMMATION AS RESULT OF THAT AND WHEN YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL ANBY A PLAYER AND YOU'RE MAKING TWENTY MILLION A YEAR E YOU DON'T WANT A LOT OF INFLAMMATION YOU WANT A LITTLE BED TO I HELP YOUR MUSCLES RECOVER BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE AM ADDING TO PROBLEMS WHEN YOU DEVELOP AN INTRY THIS IS LEEKY GOT LEE YE GOT I DON'T LOVE THAT TERM BUT YE WILL USE IT HERE SO THERE'S A THERE'S A PARTICULAR PROBATIC THAT IS HELPFUL IN ATHLETES WITH WEEKY GOT SO THAT'S TA KIND OF SPECIVIITY AND RANAMIZE TRIAL THAT I'M LOOKING FOR THE REST OF IT I THINK THERE'S SUPPORT IF YOU FIND HELP FROM IT AS YOU DESCRIBED IF YOU TAKE A COURSE OFVANABOTICS I MEAN FOR SUBALI WOULD QUESTION WHETHER YOU NEED THEM BUT THERE I TRYING OFE WAANS THERE THERE BEEN INSTANCES WHERE THEY BEEN PRESCRIBEDIN I TOOK THEM MOSTLY IN THE PASS I GWAS IN COLLEGE THEY SIMPLY THEY CANT GAVE AM OUTER YET A SCIENCEIN FE I BE YOU KNOW ANABIOTIC SESING COLLLOK THE OTHER WOR ISN'T REE THAN EVER YES SO IF YOU'RE COMING OFF VANABOUTICS I THINK THAT'S A GOOD TIME TO DO WHAT WE CALL REPLACEMENT DOS PROBATICS I THINK WHAT'S FAR MORE INTERESTING IS PRE BIATICS I THINK THE DATAAS MUCH BETTER FOR PROBIATICS AND AM THE SELECTOF USE A POLIPHENALES HW WOULD IT PERSON IN THEIR TEENS AND TWENTIES OR ANY AGE FOR THAT MATTER NO WHAT WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ANALYZE IF ONE IS GETTING ENOUGH MAGNESIUM A AND FOR THAT MATTER WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY TO TEST THE A MICROBIUM YOU SAID STHOOL SAMPLE AN I'LL COME RIGHT BACK WITH THE SAME QUESSION I ASKED ABOUT A BLOOD TEST WHAT TIME OF DAY WEN DURING THE MONTH UM TO ESTABLISH US A BASE LINE AYS TO BE PRIOR TOE BARKING ON A YOU KNOW NINETY SEVEN VEGETABLES R A A IHERD  I FIFTYS AVE WELL I LOVE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE TELLING US  IF I'M GATHERING CRECTLY IS THAT YESTER'S A CASE FOR PROBIOTICS BUT FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON REGARDLESS OF AGE EATING MORE VEGETABLES WE'RE DRINKING MORE VEGETABLES AS AS THE CASE MAY BE IT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE GOT MICROBIOM P'RHAPS WITHOUT THE NEED TO GO TEST WHETHER NOT ONE IS MAKING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ESTERGEN RELATED MATABOLITES OR NOT JUST THAT THAT'S A GREAT STARTING PLACE EAT WERE CONSUME MORE VEGETABLES OUM BUT IF ONE WANTS TO ANALYZAR GOT MICROBIUM OR THER GOOD TESTS AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC INS BEEN A NOCKA NAME COMPANIES BUT I'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS OVER THE YEARS AND IT'S NEVER BEEN CLEAR TO ME THAT WE KNOW WHAT CONSTITUENTS OF THE GOT MICROBIUM OR OR BEST YOU DON'T KNOW THAT DISPOSIS IS BAD O AND WE KNOW THAT DIVERSITY O THE MICROBIUM IS GOOD WE HEAR THIS ABUT NO ONE'S EVER TOLD ME THAT YOU WANT A PARTICULAR RATIO OF ONE MICROBIOTA TO ANOTHER IN A WAY THAT HAS MADE ANY SENSE TO ME AT LEAST TOTA I I'M NOT A MICROBIOLOGIST BUT WHEREAS WITH YOU KNOW WIT TESTOSTRON AN MEN WE HEAR OKA YOU WANT YOUR FREE TESTOSTRON TO BE ABOUT TWO PER CENT OF YOUR TOTAL PERHAPS WITH WOMEN YOU WOMEN AE CN NOT MORE TESTOSTROM THE NESTERGEN ON AVERAGE BUT STILL LESS THAN MEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT TESTOSTRON ET CETERA ET CETERA BUT YOU CCANT GET SOME SME CREEDE MEASURES BUT FOR THE ICROBIOMAT JUST SEEMS LIKE LONG LISTS OF MICROBIOTA FOR WHICH I I JUST GET DIZZY I JUST IF YOU ROTE OUT A MUNCO EYES AN ELLS AN ESSES YOU'D HAF W YOU GETNT LY A BIT A BIT THE SAME INFORMATION I'M NOT TRING TO POKE AT THAT FIELD AS A BEAUTIFUL FIELD BUT THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHAT TO WHAT I WHAT MIGHT MICROBIOTA OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE LYKE WHAT'S A HEALTHY MICROBIUM CHART WELLTHAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW I MEAN THE BES WE HAVE AS ROP NIGHTS WORK BUT EVEN THAT IS LIMITED IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW CAN I TELL YOU THAT A A WOMEN IN OR TWENTIES SOD HAVE THIS PARTICULAR PATTERN WITH HEIR MICROBIOM KNO I CAN'T SO AM LET ME GO TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION CAUS I THINK YOU JISASKED ABOUT SIX YOUR FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT NEUTRISONAL TESTING WHAT I LIKE TO DO WITH NETRISIONAL TESTING IS RUN A PIANEL THAT'S LOOKING AT ANY OCCIDENTS S LIKE MIDIMANAVE IDE BEN SEE ALFUL LI POIC ASED AUM PLANT BAS TANI OXCENS CAUSE YE CAN MEASURE THAT IN THE BLOOD I LIKE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE KEY IFIDIMEN SPECIALLY THE BE VIDIMAN RANGE BECAUSE AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT PARTICULAR GENETIC IM POLLY MORPHISM HE MIGHT BE LESS LIKELY TO BE ABSORBING THE RIGHT LEVEL OF FIGHTMENT BE NINE FUL AT I DIMN'T BE TWELVE ET CETERA IM I'M ALSO LOOKING GOING BACK TO THE ANIOCCDENTS IT GLUTITHIOM BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT LEVER WHEN IT COMES TO DTOXIFICATION WHICH WE HAVEN'T TALKED AYET AND THEN I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MINERALS MAGNESIUM IS REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WE KNOW THAT SOMEWHERE ROUND SEVENTYT EIGHT PER SON OF AMERICANS ARE DEFICIENT AND MAGNESIUM THAT'S LIKE THE THE LOWEST TANING FOR IT I WOULD BE CUROUS FRENCES LIKE WITH MAGNESIUM IF THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE DEFICIENT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THAT NUMBER O PEOPLE SHOULD BE TARGETING THEIR NUTRITION TOWARDS FOODS THAT CONTAIN MAGNESIUM AND OR SUPPLEMENTING WITH MAGNESIUM AND IF SO WHAT FORMS OF MAGNEIUM  TALKED MY MAGTHREE IN A JESLE THERE'S A MEXITRA THERE SO MANY FORMS CO BE LO BIT OF OVERWHELMING TO PEOPLE SA ANY ANY DETAIL AMEN SORCING  WOULD DAEPRECIATE IT GREAT SO FIRST IN TERMS OF TESTING WHAT I PREFER TO DO IS TO MENTION WHEN MORE THAN ONE LAP IN MORE THAN ONE BRAND A AND I CAN JUST I'M SPEAKING MOSTLY FROM EXPERIENCE SO AFOR TESTING I DO A LOT OF GENOVA NEUTRAVALS DURING THE PIANDEMIC THEY DEVELOPED IN AT HOME TEST NORMALLY WITH THE NEUTROVALL YOU HAVE TO GET TRIPLATRON AND YOUHAVE TO DO A HER ENT SAMPLE SO LOT PEOPLE CAN'T DO THAT THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS TEST IS YOURE INTURANCE USUALLY PAYS FOR MOST OF IT AND SO THE COPE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SO DURING THE PIANDEMIC THEY DEVELOPED ANOTHER TESK CALLED METABOLOMIX WHICH DOES MUCH OF THE SAME TESTING BUT IT'S A FINGER PRICK SO MOST MY PATIENCE PREFER THAT IN FACT THEY HAVEN'T GONE BACK TO THE NUTROVAL SECOND LAB IS SPECTRASELL I USE SPECTRESAL ACCUSIONALLY I FIND IT NOT QUITE AS EASY AND TERMSIFITING INTO MY PRACTICE BUT I'VE GOT FRIENDS AN MEN TORS LIKE MARCUSON WHO DOES A LOT OF A CONA PRECISION A CARDIA METABOLIC HEALTH HE THINK SPECTRESELVES THE BEST TESTD OUT THERE SO YOU ASKED ABOUT MAGNESIUM OU HAVE TO MEASURE RED BLOOD SAL MAGNESIUM MIK COAL BLOOD AND WITH DEFICIENCY IT'S INTERESTING WITH SUPPLEMENTATION FOR MY PATIENCE WHO TEN TOARD CONSTIPATION AND THAT'S FRANKLY ABOUT EIGHTY PERSN OF THE WOMEN THAT I TAKE CARE OF REALLY YES W I BECURIOUSAS TO WHY THAT THAT IS  I I CAN GUESS A DIET STRESS AM PATRIARCHY RAGE THE PSYCHI PSYCHCLMAY NOT KNOW I GOUGHT SO PING THAT A THE PINE SYSTEM RIGT E PSPSYCHL PSYCHOLOGY IMENOLOGY NURL AND ENDEGRAN FACTORS COMEBINE  YES AND THN I WOULD SEY THERE'S ANOTHER FACTOR WHICH IS BEING FEMALE IS A HEALFAZARD SO WE'VE TWICE THE RAT OF DEPRESSION IN SOMNIA WE'VE GOT THREE TOFOREXS INCREASE RISK OF MULTIPL SCLOROSIS WE'VE GOT FIVE TO EIGHT TIMES THE RISK OF FIRATE DISFUNCTION SO IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THAT AND YOU LOOK AT SUBTLE PRECLINICAL FIR DIS FUNCTION A HUGE NUMBER OF THE WOMENTHAT I TAKE CARE OF WILLI ME PACOV A LARGE NUMBER OF THE WOMEN THAT I TAKE CARE OF HAV FIRI DISFUNCTION THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO CONSTIPATION AND IF WE GO BACK TO THAT CONTROLSISTEM NI WITH U LIMIC POTUTERATRIN ALTHIRIT CANATAL GOD ACIS AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF PERCEIVEDSTRESS TOGETHER WITH IS BORDER LINE FIRATE FUNCTION THAT NO MEANSTRY MEDICINE DOCTOR HAS TOLD HER IS A PROBLEM AND THEN SHE'S GOT A PROBLEM WITH THE TANGO BETWEEN ESTERTON AND PROGESTOR ON SHE'S GOIN TO TEND TOWARD CONSTIMATION WOMEN HAVE A LOT MORE CONSTIPMATION THAN MEN THE GOT IS ABOUT TEN FEET LONGER IN WOMEN COMPARED TO MEN WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT SOME SECSAN GENDER DIFFERENCES AND TO FINE TUS SURE AND THEY ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A TORTUROUS COEN AND THE WAY YOU KNOW THAT IS YOU GET A COLLONOSCOBY AND THEY TELL YOU NOW I'S REALLY HARD LI GET IN HERE AN DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A BRIEF TENSION BUT I THINK THIS IS THE TIME TO ASK EM AT WHAT AGE NOW DO PHYSICIANS INSIST THEIR FEMALE PATIENCS GET COLONOSCAPIECE A FOR MEN I THINK THE AGE IS TO BE FIFTY NOW IT'S GETTING RACHETED BACK TO FORTY FIVE OR FORTY BEGAN THESE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS NOT REQUIREMENTS BUT THEIR PRETTY STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS FROM DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE ET CETERA UM FOR WOMEN POWARDLY YOU THINK THEY SHOULDGET A CALLINOSCABY TO TO EXPLORE FORE POSSIBLORE POLLOPS AND OR A COLIN CANCER YET'S REALLY GOOD QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER SO WHAT I'VE ALWAYS OPERATED WITH IS FIFTY THE WAY THAT I ANSWER THAT IS TO GO TO THAT YOU AS PREVENT OF TAS FORESRATING TO DETERMINE BAS ON NERSINTESIS AF THE DATA WAT AGES MOST APPROPRIATE HAS A CHANGE AS YOU JUST DESCRIBED FOR MEN FROM FIFTY TO YOUNGER I DON'T KNOW SO WE SHOULD FACTALL THESE M ADDITIONAL HEALTH HAZARDS FOR WOMEN UM YOU MENTION SOME OF THE YOU BROADLY MENTION PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT RIGHT AN AND OF COURSE THESE THINGS ARE ALL RELATED PSYCHOLOGY OF MENOLOGY AND THAT ONE O THAT I THINK WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT NERO SCIENCE AND SCIENCE IN GENERAL IN MEDICINE IS THAT THERE'S NOW AN AN UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL THE ORGANS ARE CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER IT'S AN NETWORD IT'S AN ATWORK AND THAT THE MICRO BYOM SITS IT HAD UM AT A KEE NOTE WITHIN THAT NAT WORK UM AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE EXCEPT THAT NOW YES YETHAT SEEMS TO BE A THENE THAT AT LEAST IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IS REALLY WONDERFUL BECAUSE UM CERTAINLY FOR NERW SCIENCE HO WAS THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW UNLESS IT'S IN THE CRANIAL VAULT IT'S NOT NERL WHICH IS RIDICULOUS CAUS THER S LOTS ON NERVOUS SYSTEM OUTSIDE THE SKULL BUT IN ANY CASE FOR I INTERUP FOR A SECON YES PLECE SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE NETWORK EFFECT BUT I THINK THAT AS MUCH AS I LOVE MANSTRYNE MEDICIN AND I TRAINED IN IT AND I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR MY EDUCATION I STILL THINK IT IS A SILO BASE WAY OF TAKIN CARE OF PATIONS SO EVEN IF THERE'S AN UNDER STANDING OF THE NOTWORK OF FACT MORE AT THE SCIENCE LEVEL OR IS YOU DESCRIBED IN NEURO SCIENCE THERE'S STILL YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE A WOMAN WHO AS CONSTIPATION FATIGUE UM MAYBE AN OTO ME IN CONDITION FEEL STRESSED OUT ALL THE TIME FEU LIKE YOUR WARMONS ARE OUT A WAC YOU GET SENT TO THE GASTERONEROLOGIST FOR THE CONSTIPATION YOU GET SENT TOU THE REUMATOLOGIST FOR YOUR AUTOM UNISIOUS YOU MAYBE GET SENT TO AN UNDER CHRONOLOGIST IF YOU'VE GOT DIRATE PROBLEMS AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE COLABERATIONN BETWEEN THESE GROUPS SO EVEN THOUGH THERE'S N UNDERSTANDING NOTHIN NETWORK OF FACT IN RE LIFE IT'S NOT HAPPENING LET'S UM BUT'S GO DEEPER DOWN THAT PATH CAUSE I POINT OUT SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT AND AND YOU'VE MENTION CONSTIPATION A FEW TIMES CAN WEVOU CONSTIPATION AS A SERIOUS ENOUGH SYMPTOM THAT IT WARRANTS IN IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION THAT IS DOES IT FLAG OR SIGNAL PROBLEMS THAT ARE SEVERE ENOUGH THAT THAT SHOULD BE THE ISSUE THAT'S DEALT WITH A FOR ANYBODY THAT'S EXPERIENCING IT AN I MEAN SORT OF AN ODD TOPIC FOR MANY PEOPLE COS ATHING O YU KNOW BAW MOVEMENTS AN SOR YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT KIND OF A PREADOLESCENT HUMOR AROUND THIS BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S SO IMPORT WHEN YOU'RE WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT CONSTIPATION IS FAR MORE COMMON IN WOMEN AND IT'S SIGNALS A GENERAL TAT MANY PROBLEMS OCCURRING DOES THAT MEAN THAT WOMEN SHOULD ADDRESS CONSTIPATION AND IF SO WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS CONSTIPATION YEI LOVE IS QUESTION BECAUS YOU'RE DOING YOU HAVE A QUICK LITTLE METIC CONVERSATION SO YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT I KNEW YOU OITD DO WHICH IS YOU'RE TEACHING ME SOMETHING IN YOU'RE CHANGING LIKE THERE'S A SOCIAL GENOMIC THING HAPPENING WHERE YOU'RE CHANGING MY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS SO I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE  I THINK YTHANK YOU WHY I THINK FOR ME WOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR THAT THERE'S A KIND OF YOU KNOW YOU TAKE OUT A FENATYPE CONSTIPATIONS OF FENA TYPE IT'S ONE THAT PEOPLE GENERALLY DON'T WHERE TEA SHIRT EXPLAINING IT T PEOPLE BUT THAT I'M GUESSING ANTHING TO DO WITH SEXUAL HEALTH A BOWEL HEALTH YOU'RE ALLAGE PEOPLE JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT RIGHT UM FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS AND THOSE REASONS ARE PROBABLY SO OBVIOUS THAT THE'RE OT IVEN WORTH DISCUSSING  BECAUSE AND WAT ALSO BCAUSE WE WON'T CHANGE THEM EXCEPT BY TALKING ABOUT THEM YET SO IF YOU SAY UM WOMEN ARE FAR MORE CONSTIPATED AND THAT SIGNALING A LARGER SET OF PROBLEMS YES THEN MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHT IS WELL RELIEVING  CONSTIPATION U UN ENDED WRETTORACTIVELY A WI'LL THAT ASSIST IN A GREAT NUMBER OF ISSUES AND OR WILL IT GET THEM DOWN THE ROAD OF THINKING ABOUT THOSE OTHER ISSUES MORE SPECIFICALLY LIKE DO I NEED MORE MANESIEMER SHOULD I AD PUTTING VEGETABLES IN MY SMOOTHY O SOME CURIOUS ABOUT CONSTIPATION AS A TORGET YE FOR INTERVENTION THAT THEN OPENS UP A BUNCH OF OTHER DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE THESE CERTAIN NOTES IN THE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH SPACE THAT WHEN SOME ONE YOU LIKE WE TUCGLE OUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE DO I THINK IT'S MAGIC NO BUT I THINK THAT IF SOMEONE'S GETTING THEMSELVES INTO A COLD SHOWER ONCE A DAY IT OPENS UP A NON A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THEMSELVES AND REVEALS AN NUMBER OF THINGS TO THEMSELVES LOK HOW DO I BO FER STRESS YE WHAT SORTS OF LEVELS OF CONTROL TOI ACTUALLY HAVE AND ON AND ON SO PERHAPS NOT THE BEST EXAMPLE BUT ELEN IS SOME OF US HA COLD EXPOSURE RIGHT WHICH HAN WE HAVE WE HAVE LIKE A GENG THAT MAKES US STRESS OUT LIKE YOU RN BELIEVE WHICH FOLD EXOSH WHICH I WOULD ARGUE MAKES IT A VERY LIKELY THAT EVEN TEN SECONS OF COLD EXPOSURE GETS YOU THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT AS A TAS THO SOMEWON WHO A DORS COLD EXPOSURE LIKE A PENGUIN NEEDS A LOT MORE COLD EXPOSURE FOR TO HAVE THE THE ADAPTIVE RESPONSIANYWAY THAT'S MY WAY OF OF AV  GUMBING THROUGH THAT I QUITE A YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE QUITE CORRECT A SO SO LET'S ANSWER THIS QUESTION AS I PATION ISSUE Y SO THIS IS HOW YOU'RE CHANGING THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THUS SO YOUARE ASKING OCA INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT CONSTIMATION AS A CONSTELLATION AS SYMPTOMS WHAT ABOUT IF YU JUST YOU SIT ON ITS OWN AS SORT OF A A A KEY INDICATOR OR SIGNAL OF DISFUNCTION WITH MY NETWORK OR MAY BE SOMETHING BROUHTER AND I THINK THAT'S RIGHT SO IT MAKES ME THINK OF A FEW THINGS IT MAKES ME YOU'RE ALSO CHANGING THIS BOOK THAT I'M WRITING ON OT A COMMUNITY AND TRAMA O THINK YOU FOR THAT SO WOMEN EXPERIENCE MORE TRAMA THAN MEN THIS IS WELL ESTABLISHED IF YOU LOOK AT THE A STUDIES THAT WERE DONE BY THE SEEDY SIN KISER IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WE KNOW THAT MEN FOR THE MOST PART MIDDLE AGE MEN HAVE ABOUT A ABOUT FIFTY PER CEN OF THEM EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT TRAMA ASK TO FIND BY THE ACE QUESTIONER WOMEN ARE AT SIXTY PER CENT AND THAT'S PRETTY DURABLE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SO WOMEN HAVE MORE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ABUSE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SEXUAL APUCE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT H P RESPONSE THAN MEN THERE PERCIVE STRESS TENS TO BE HIGHER AND I'M GENERALIZING FOR A POPULATION SIDT NOTE YOU KNOWN PERSISTION MEDICINE WE DON'T DO THAT WE DO MEDICINE FOR TH INDI INDIVIDUAL NOT THE POPULATION NOT MEDICINE FOR THE AVERAGE AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF A FEMALE I THINK THAT A CONSTIPATION AND THAT NEED TO LIKE CONTROL AND RESTRAIN AND WHOLD THINGS IN YOUM TIGHTEN THE ANAL PINCTER ITHINK THAT'S PART OF THE PHYSIOLOGY SO I'M VEARYING AWAY FROM THE SCIENCE BUT I DO THINK THAT IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT SIGNAL TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO NOW YOU ALSO ASKED ABOUT MICHRO BY ON TESTING SO WE DO THAT IDEA IVE WHEN IAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESHIONS ABOUT CONSTAPATION I NEVER THOUGHT I ASK US MAYIN QUESTION H CONSME BEN ON FASTD BY THE WAY ALSO THIS MORNING I TAUGHT MEDICAL STUNES OF STANDFORD ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE BASICLLY A SERIES OF TUBES SO TH YOU TALKED ABOUT THE THE ANAL PINKER WE ARE A SET OF SPHINCTERS FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER IVN WE ARE SEDAY TUBES A OR NERVOUS SYSTEM BEING ONE OF THOSE TUBES AND BUT AND I INK IN EASTERN MEDICINE THEY TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS LOCKS BETWEEN THOSE TUBES AND CHAMBERS AND IIT'S NOT WITHOUT COINCIDENCE THERE'S SOME REAL WISDOM THERE OF COURSE WAM DID YOU JUST TALK ABOUT ENERGETIC ANATOMY AM MORE LESS I DIDN'T SAY THE WORD CHOCKERUS BUT I MIGHT IN PAINS THE BOND S AR ETON US RIGHT AR THAR THE AR THE THE THE SPHINCTERS YES YES US RIGHT I THANK YOU FOR FOR THAT THE UM SO WHAT DEFINES CONSTIPATION I MEAN IN OTHER WORDS ASING BOUT THE HEALTHY RATHER AN THING ABOUT THE UNHEALTHILESS HOW MANY BOWL MOVEMENTS SHOULD UM I WOMAN OR A MAN HAVE PER DAY ASSUMING THIS IS WHERE GETS TRICKY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING SOME PA REAING MORE SOME PEOPLEING MORE  IVER MORE BULK LARGER MEAL THE END OF THE DAY LARGING EA THE BEGINNING TO WE WILL NEVER UM BE ABLE TO SORT OUT ALL THOSE VARIABLES BUT ON AVERAGE U HOW MANY BOW MOVEMENTS AND IS TIMING DURING THE DAY FOR BOEL MOVEMENTS AT ALL A INFORMATIVE WHAT ORKS FOR YOU UM WELL WHEN I'M ASLEEP UM GENERALLY I DON'T WANT A BOEL MOVEMENT SIM GAAY LIKE MUST FEE RI WELL S IS PRIMARY FORYR IT EXACTLY UM I'M I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT MORNING TIME YET WAS A WAS A HEALTHY TI'M YA MOVEMENTS UM AND I THINK ALMOST EVERYBODY BABYES INCLUDED RECOGNIZE THE FEELING OF BEING LIGHTER AND MORE ENERGETIC WHEN THE'VE EVACULATED TOTALL HOLIN TOTALL I'M IN FACT SO MUCH SO THAT I'M I'M OBSESS WITH YUNGIAN IMPHRODIAN PSYCHOLOGY THAT THE FIRST THING WE LEARN WHEN WE COME INTO THIS WORLD RIGHT IS THAT WE WANT SOMETHING WE WE FEEL SOME SORT OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL STRESS WER NOT ITS FOOD OR WARMTH OR THE NEED TO HAVE A BOW MOVING ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT PARENTS LEARN IS HOW TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT BY THE ODOR COMING FROM THE DIPER BUT BY THE LOOK ON THE BABY'S FACE AT AGITATION AGITATION SIGNALS THE NEED FOR SOME SORT OF RELIEF RIHT TEMPERATURE RELIE FOOD RELIEF UM EVACUATING THE BOWEL RELIEF SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AS AUTONOMIC AROWSAL INCREASES IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY IDEALLY AFTER A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP THAT BOW MOVEMENTS BECOME MORE LIKELY UNLESS THAT AROUSALL BECOMES SO GREAT THAT THEN PEOPLE FEEL SO QUITINK  LOCKED UP RIH UM BECAUSE THE THE BALANCE OF THE AUTONOMICS OF FEATURES SO EARLY DAY I'M GUESSING AND AGAIN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY AND HEARE I'M TOTALLY GUESSING UM AND CERTAINLY NOT HAVING TO WAKE IN THE MID ALL THE NIGHT UM YET THOSE ARE MY BESS GUESSUS THAT'S GREAT SO I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT WHEN I WAS THAT HARBARD MEDICAL SQUALL AND YOU SEE A A FORINCIDENCY I WAS TAUHT THA CONSTIPATION IS HAVENGT AT BAW MOVE MEANT LESS FREQUENTLY THAN WHENEVER WHENCE EVERY THREE DAYS SO I HAVE'T OT NOTHING OF EVER LAUGHED OUT LAUGHED WHEN THIS PLUNCAST IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF OF A TEXFIC MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE ARE YOU KITTING ME IS THAT RIDICULA  THAT SOUNDS LIKE AND AND HERE PON INTENDED THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE A THE CONCLUSION OF SOME VERY UM CONSTAMATING MERELATIONALLY AND AND AND AND IN OTHER WAYS CONSEPATED INDIVIDUALS AND I AGAIN THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN ODD CONVERSATION BUT THE THE DISCUSSION AROUND CONSTIMATION IS IS PRESENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE YES ITBECAUSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE AUTONOMIC SYSTEM BULL IT'S A MEDAPHOR IN LITERATURE IT'S CRUCIAL SO YOU YOU SPOKE TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THREADS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT HERE SO THAT'S THE DEFINITION THAT I LEARNED AND I WAS I HEARD THAT NOWS LIKE HELL KNOW THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME DOESN'T WORK FOR ANY ONE I KNOW AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ESPECIALLY IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND IN MY INTERENTSHIP WHERE YOU ROTATE ON MEDICINE DISIMPACTING WOMEN LIKE OLDER WOMEN WHO COME IN WHO HAVE AN AT ABOUL MOVEMENT IN A MONTH WO IN T LET ME TELL YOU THATICE NOT NICE FOR ANYBODY BELE ME ID I BECAME A SCIENTIS AN O PHYSICION FOR A NEREOF REASON  N BOTH POSITNEGUTIVE THAT'S ONE OF YE SO MY DEFINITION OF CONSTIPATION AS A WESTERN MOSTLY WHITE GIRL IS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING A BOUD MOVEMENT EVERY SINGLE MORNING AND YOU HAVE A FEELING OF COMPLETE EVACUATION ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT IS CONSTIMATION SO THAT'S HOW I DEFIND IT IF YOU'RE IN INDIA IN YOU'RE EATING FOOD THAT'S GOT A FAIR AMOUNT OF MY CRUBS IN IT IT'S LOSS E NOW SANITARY MUSING THAT WORD AM AS CAREFULLY AS I CAN GENERALLY THEY HAVE A BOUT MOVEMENT AFTER EVERY MEAL BUT THEY'VE GOT A DIFFERENT MY CROBIUM THEIR EXPOSE TO DIFFERENT MY CRUBS HERE AND THE YOU US I WOULD SAY ONCE DAY YOU ALSO SPOKE TO SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE PARI SYMPHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEN REST IN DIGEST AND POOP FIRSE IS THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM CONOTONBUTTON YOU KNOW FIGHT FLIGHT FREEZE FON SO I THINK FOR THOSE OF US WHO'VE GOT IS SUES WITH AUTONOMIC BALANCE IT CAN LEAD TO CONSTIMATION AND I LIKE THAT CONSTIPATION COULD BE PULLED OUT AND KIND OF WRIT LARGER AS AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL WHAT SORTS OF TOOLS YOU RECOMMEND PEOPLE USE TO A RELIEVE CONSTIPATION A IN CEEATING MORE FIBRE SONDS IN REDUCING STRESS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE ONE YES WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE STRESS REDUCTION E TOOLS A I LIKE TO DIVIDE THESE INTO A REAL TIME TOOLS SO BE PROPONET OFLECT PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGHING REAL TIM YOU KNOW THESE SORT OF THINGS BUT A THINGS IT CAN REALLY LOWER THE BASE LINE ON STRESS OVER ALL TO FACILITATE CONSTIPATION AND OTHER THER A BROUGHT INDICATORS OF HEALTH SO I'M NOT A FAN OF LOWERING STRESS I'M A FAN AT FLOWERING PERCEIVE STRESS AND I THINK THE DISTINCTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT I LEARNED WHEN I WAS IN MY THIRTIES THAT I WAS A MASS OF STRESCASE AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT IT WAS A SORT OF I THINK I HAD THROUGH RESIDENCY THROUGH WORKING HUNDER TWENTY HOURS A WEEK I JUST WAS SO ACCUSTOMED AND SORT OF UM THAT WAS ONE TRAN AN TWENTY NOT YENDER TWENTY FOLKS YET YET THERE'S NOT UNUSUAL IN IN MEDICINE WELL THEY THEY'VE CHANS TRAINING SO THAT YOU WORK NO MORE THAN EIGHTY HOURS SO WE NOW BUT THAT WAS BEFORE MY TIME SO I BECAME A CUSTOMED TO A MASS OF MOUNTA CORTIS ALL MASSOV AND I WOULD SAY I'VE SPENT THE PAST TWENTY YEARS SREALLY WORKING ON PERCEIVE STRESS TO FIND I THINK ALL OF US NEEDNT ALL THE CART MENA OF WHAT IS MOST EFFECTIVE SO WHAT WORKS FOR ME NOW AT MY AGE IS DIFFERENT THEN INA THE THE TAM I DID AS A COLLEGE STUDEN TRANSCENDUNTAL MEDITATION AN IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE I BECAME A SORT OF ID YO COULD TEACHER WHEN I WAS IN MY THIRTIES THAT IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR MY MATRICS I DO HOLATROPIC BREATH WORK UM I DIDN'T READ IT BUT I SAW THAT HE TO SET A PAPER AND SO ON YOUR SIGIN AND UM IT CONIT IT MAY ME THINK LIKE TEACH ME NOW TO I TEACH TEACH ME HOW TO SYLIC CAN YOU SAY A LITTLE OF IT ABOUT THAT LI YURARE YOU DO IT YET BUT VERY BRIEFLY THAT STUDY WAS WE WE WANTED TO FIND A MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSE INTERVENTION YE FI'VE I NON ON IT YEN I VENT TO DAY WE NEED TO FIGER OUT WHAT PEOPLE DO EVERY DAY YET AND WE WERE MONITERING SUBJECTIVE MOOD AT CETERA BUT ALSO BIOMETRICS REMOTELY SO'S COME A IC LETY I AMETRICS IT AR VE A CHARVE A NIGHT TIME SLEE TOART US ALL A I WISH UM SO THIS WAS DONE DURING THE PENDEMIC MORE THAN A HUNDRED SUBJECTS THE ADVANTAGE WAS THAT WE GOT DATA TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAYS THEIR PINGING US IN THEIR DATA A WERE I AR MEDANY FOR IT YE NIS SO THAT WAS NICE RESTING HEART RATE UM SUBJECTIVE MOOD WE WOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM DAILY SO ONE PEOPLE WERE SWAP BETWEEN GROUPS LIKE ANY GOOD STUDY BUT FIVE MINUTE A DAY OF S OR STANDARD IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME MEDITATION TO TO SITTING NO INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT HOW TO BREATHS JUST FOCUSSING ON UM CLOSING THEIR EYES AN FOCUSSING ON FOCUSING YE UM ANOTHER GROUP DID BOXBREATHIN YET IN HAL HOLD EXELL HOLD FOR EQUAL DURATIONS THE DURATION OF EACH OF THOSE IN HALS AND HOLDS WAS SET BY THERE CARBONDOXI TOLERANC SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE IN EIGHT SECONDS TO PAGON HOW WELL THEY REGULATE O CARBONDOXIDE ANOTHER GROUP DID SICLIC SIGHING SO THIS WOULD BE DOUBLE IN HAIL THROUGH THE NOSE SO BIG IN HAL THROUGH THE NSE FOLLOWED BY IT TO LUNGS EMPTY EXHAL THAT SECOND IN HAL AFTER THE FIRST BIG LONGIN HAL THROUGH THE NOSE IS REALLY IMPORTAT BECAUSE IT MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE COLLAPSE A YLY LUNGS TOTALIS NAP OPEN AND THEN THE EXCELL YOU AWF LOAT ALOUT OF CARBODOXIDE THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO HOLL A TRUPIC BRETH WORK NOT YES NOT NOT UM NOT UNLIKE COLOTROPIC BREATHWORK LITTLE BIT PRONIAMA ISH UM BUT THE EXAL IS RATHER PASSIVE AS OPPOSED TO ACTIVE UM AND THEN THE FOURTH CATEGORY WAS SYCLIY PREVENTILATION WHICH IS A LOT LIKE TUMO A C WIM HOFF ISH BRETHING DIFFERENT IN WIMHOFF BREATHING SO THIS WOULD BE SO VERY ACTIVE IN HALS AND EXALES EVERY TWENTY FIVE CYCLES OF INHALE AXAL THE WULD BE ONE CYCLE LONG EXAL HOLD LUNGS EMPTY FIFTEEN TO THIRTY SECONDS THEN REPEAT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TH IF EVERYONE DID THAT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THE SYCLIC SIGHING LED TO THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD AROUND THE CLOCK NOT JUST AROUND THE THE PRACTICE OR DURING THE PRACTICE AS WELL AS LOWERED RESTING HEART RATE IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP ET CETERA AND YOU GOT A PUBLISHED AND S WE WERE TAON  DAZE TE AR VERY FORTUNATE I I THINK AM THAT THE THANKFULLY THE REVERS N ETTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE MINIMAL INTERVENTION THINGS A FLLY OF CAN BE OF USE TO PEOPLE ALSO SO USEFUL TO PEOPLE I MEAN HOW OFTEN DO YOU READ A PAPER LIKE THAT THAT COULD OFFER A BEHAVIOUR CHANGE THAT IS SO EASY TO IMPLMEN AMM I LOVE THAT QUESTION THANK YOU SO WHAT ABOUT DID YOU TELL THEM NOT TO DRINK BECAUSE ALCL HAS SUCH A UGEIFECT ONETER ME YESO IN THIS CASE WE DIDN'T TELL THEM TO ALTER ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIO IS HOPING IT WA S AT BACKGROUND KIND OF CROSS THE SAMON AYES AND SOMEWHERE STAMFORD STUDENTS OTHERS WERE FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION ANY FRAT BOYS AI HEAVILY PROBABLY NOT WELL DURING THE PANDEMIC I THINK ALCOHOL IN TAKE WENT WAIT WAY UP ACROSS THE BOARD UM I MEAN IS ENOUGH IATOMAGIC WAND I WOULD I WOULD ASS AT PEOPLE EITHER NOT DRINK OR DRINK TWO DRINKS PER WEEK MAXA MOMENT LEASE THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IN HE LITERATURE UM ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE WHOOP DATA WITH OUT CALL NO BUT WE HAVE A COLLABORATION WITH WOOP THROUGH THAT PAPER YUM AND IT' CERTAINLY DISTRUPTS PATTERNS OF NIGHT TIME SLEEP IN PARTICULAR MON MY UNDERSTANDING THAT FIRST PHASE OF SLEEP THAT'S RELATED TO THE MASSIVE GROWTHROME ONE RELEASE YE YOU WE ALL RELEA NEED AND WANTIN ANY THEREIS MESUR THM WE DID NOT NO THE SECOND INTERATION OF THE STUDY WE'LL CERTAINLY INCLUDE FREE COART IS ALL BY SOM A A AND O A HORMMONE PALS WELL I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALSO UM E ASKING PEOPLE HOW TEN THE'RE GOING TO THE BATHROOM IN WHAT TIME OF DAY YES I MEAN IT THIS THING AROUND CONSTIPATION IS A IS SUPERINTERESTING AND I THINK THAT PLUS UM BLOOD BLOOD MARKERS AND THEN I'M I' VERYIDE TO LEARN THAT UEM THAT YOU'RE IN CONTAINS ADDITIONAL MARKERS THAT COULD BE INFORMATIVE SO YEI WAS IT IT WAS A FUN STUDY A NOT EASY STUDY TO DO WITH THAT NUMBER OF OF SUBJECTS UM THASSE LOT A DRAIN FOR YOUR RESERTA TISTENCE YE WAS A BIG GROUP IS NINE PEOPLE IN OUR GROUP AND A THREE CLINITIONS AND A LOT OF LOT OFPHONE CALLS AND A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BUT YETAN THANK YOU TO THE SUBJECTS WHO SERVED AS THE IE LIFE GUINEA PIGS SO YE I THINK THAT STRESS YOU KNOW PEOPLES I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO APPRECIATE THAT THERE AREWAYS THAT THEY CAN RELIEVE THEIR STRESS AT THE DON'T AL ONLY FALL UNDER THE CATEGORIES OF VACATION RA AND MEDITATION BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT MEDITATION IS OBVIOUSLY A WONDERFUL TOOL AM IT'S JUST ITS A IT'S A TOOL NOT UNLIKE ANY OTHER TOOL THAT IT IS GREAT FOR SOME PEOPLE AND LESS GREAT FOR OTHERS WELL IT CERTAINLY IT'S A GREAT TOA AN IT'S GOT SUCH A SCIENTIFIC BASIS BEHIND IT BUT THERE'S SO MANY THINGS ON TIS OLLICART MANYOW SACS ORGASUM UM CONNECTION FEELING HEARDAN SEEM AND LOVED UM ILLES TALK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW I MENTION EARLIER THE ALL THESE STRESS FACTORS YOU YOU SAID PATRIARCHY RIGHT EBUT I THINK WHAT IF I MAY UM AT RISK OF A OF JUST STRENGTHENING THAT A STATEMENT I I MEAN THAT THAT TO ME IT'S IS SIGNALING A BUNCH OF OTHER FACTORS AROUND AS YOU SAID LI I HE THINK KEEPING THINGS IN UM WHAT YOU THINK EXPLAINS LET LESS TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S LIKELY TO HAVE RAISED TO CERTAIN FLAG AND PEOPLE'S MINDS LIKE WHAT EXACTLY IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ARE YOU TELLING ABOUT LESS OPPORTUNITY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LESS OPPORTUNITY TO U TO VOCALIZE ARE YOU TELLIG ABOUT LESS OPPORTUNITY TO VOCALIZES AND BE HEARD I MAN I REALIZE THAT THERE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF ARIABLES BUT GIVEN THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A A REALLY STRONG IN PUT TO THE SYSTEM A WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT PSYCHOLOGY IS INFLUENCING BIOLOGY IN YOUR SAYING THAT THAT THESE A THAT THESE POWERS POWER DYNAMICS STRUCTURES AND DYNAMICS ARE IUPACKING ID LOVED LETERIAR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE A I I HATE TO LET A FLAG LIKE THT GO BY D OUT FLUSHING IT OUT AND WEVER WAS A GOOD FLAG WELL I LET'S PREFACE IT BY BY JUST SAYING THAT LIKE PEOPLE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THIS AND THAT'S AND I THINK THAT'S HEALTHY AND AND LIKE WITH THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CONSTABATION LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO TALK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH LOV IT SO WE MIGHT MEED TO TALK ABOUT PATRIARCHY UN PARTO BUT I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MATERIAL THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH I STARTED I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTANDY EXISTENCE A PATRIARCHY UNTIL I WAS A BY WEN NEERING UNDER GRAT TO IT AND IMI TE I SHOULD MENTION WHICH HAS ALWAYS HAD A BIT OF A OF A MALE AU ASCEWED MALE IN TERMS OF YOU THINK ILTY NUMBERS WELL MY MY LET'S TRUE MAS UNERIS IT I TRUE WELL MY POSTOCK ADVISER WAS THE LATE BEN BARRISS WHO WAS A FEMALE TO MALE TRANSITION TRANSGENDER INTEREST IRSTRNEND REMEMBER THE NATIONAL CATEMY OF SCIENCES WERE MY CLOSEST FRIENDS UNFORTUNATEY DIED OF OF PANCRATIC CANSER WE'RE VERY VERY CLOSE A SHAN I CANT DOCUMENTARY ABOUT BEN BUT BEN THIS IS INTERESTING BEN WENT TOMI TEA EAS HE WANTED TO BE AROUND A LOT OF MEN YE THAT'S AN LESSER KNOWN FACT BUT THEN HE WAS A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN HE WENT TO ASBARBARA WHEN HE WAS BARBARA AND UM BY THE WY HE'S GIVEN ME PERMISSION TO SHARE ALL THIS PRIORY IS DEATH I RECORDED A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS YEN UM I ONLY EVER KNEW HIM HAS BEEN BY THE WAY BUT WHEN HE WAS IT A MI TEA HE WAS IDENTIFIED FEMALE AND HE LATER TALK ABOUT THE INTENSE UM SUPPRESSION OPPRESSION THERE IS HOW HE DESCRIBED IT AM ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT HE WAS PERFORMING SO WELL YES SO YOU JUST DEFINED PATRARCHEY YOU DID IT YOURSELF COUPLE THINGS WHEN I WAS IN BYO WENGINEERING I TOOK A WOMEN' STUDIES CLASS AND IT WAS ALL ABOUT TEACHING UNDER GRADUATES ABOUT THE EXISTENCE O PATRIARCHY WHICH I WOALD DEFIND MAYBE AT ITS SIMPLEST AS POWER OVER I'M NOT SAYING MEN ARE PATRURCHEY I'M SAYING SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT WHICH IS POWER OVER LET ME CORRECT ONE THING THAT SHE SAID I DIDN'T GO TO AM MI TEASIN INTEGRATUAT SO I AM FROM I WAS IN ALASKA AND I WENT TO UNIVERS SEEP WASHINGTON FOR BYWENGINEERING IN SEEATTL IN SEEATTLE I DROPPED OUT OF A GRADUATE PROGRAMM AN BY O ENGINEERIENG TO GO TO THE HARFARD AM MI TEA PROGRAMM FOR HELL SCIENCIS IN TACHNOLOGY IN BOSTON THANKS FOR THAT CLARIFICATION UNIVERSHY WASHINGTON ALSO WONDERFUL PLACE I HAVE MANY MAN I AS MANY MANY MANY WONDERFUL CLOSE COLLEAGUES THERE IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PLACE ESPECIALLY FOR VISION SCIENCE IT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR ENGINEERING BY O ENGINEERING BUT IM YOSO MY MY EMT IS JOINTLY BETWEEN AM MI TA AND HARFARD AND IT'S THE OLDEST MAYBE LARGEST ALTHOUGH HARFARD SOYS IS LOT PROGRAMM FOAR BIAMENICAL ENGINEERS AND A EMPTY PAGTYS PHYSICIAN SCIENTIST STRANING PROGRAM  THANKS FOR THAT CLARIFICATION I'MEAN TO BLAME THE INTERNATE FOR THIS I AM I THINK WE DAN TO SEND OR R A WICKAPEDIA EDITOR'S OUT II THINK LINKED IN AS CORRECT OK GREAT WELL WE WICKAPEDIA A EDITOR'S NOTE IT GET OUT THERE AND MAKE THAT MAKE THE CORRECTION NOW YOU HEARD IT AM SO STRESS THAT IS WHAT YOU REALLY TALKING ABOUT HIS SYSTEMAC STRESS IN THE BODY AS A CONSOFS AS A CONSEQUENCE SKEUS ME OF SYSTEMAC STRESS OF ENVIRONMENT THAT'S RIGHT BUT THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S PARTICULAR FORMS OF IT I WOULD SAY THIS ALSO RELATES TO WHI PRIVILEGE IT RELATES TO A RASIS M AND WHEN YOU LOOK IT YOU KNOW CUND OF THE WAY THAT SYSTEMS INCLUDING MY BELOVED AM MI TEA THE WAY THAT THERES SET UP IS THAT MYT MAKE CRISMAKES RIGHT AND GENERALLY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE STRONGEST YOU KNOW BIG MEN STRONG MEN THEYARE THE ONES TO TEND TO BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BY POCK FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE WHITE PRIVILEGE FOR WOMEN IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE AND SO I'M YOU SEING PETRURCKHEY AS KIND OF A UMBRELLA HERE BUT IT CONNECTS TO MANY OTHER THINGS ONT US THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO AY KEEP THIS IN MIND AS WE TURN TO IT A QUESTION TH T I DIDN'T A CLOSE THE HACH ON EARLIER IN IT'S MY FAULT WHICH IS I'M NOW CLEAR ON THE FACT THAT A WOMAN IN HER LATEENS EARLY TWENTIES OUGHT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HER TESTOSERONE ESTERGEN THIROOD CORTIS ALL LEVELS SHOULD START AT LEAST THINKING ABOUT HER MICR MYOM SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW HOW MANY BOWEL MOVEMENTS IN THE TIMING THOSE BAWL MOVEMENTS PER DAY REALLY AND I'M ASSUMING THAT WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS ALSO TRUE FOR WOMAN IN THERE TWENTY'S THIRTY'S FORTYS FIFTY'S ON UP TO HUNDREDS IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT BUT WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES BY DECADE SO I'M GLAD YH'S CIRCLED ABACK TO TEA NATURES AND TESTOSTERON BECASE I THINK A FEW KNOW FOR INSTANCE IN YOUR TEEN AHE YEARS THAT YOU AVE HIGH ANDERGENS AND THAT YOU'VE GOT THIS PETENSOL PHINATYPE WAY AN TO THE FUTURE THAT YOU MAY NOT EVEN NOTICE AM ME MAYBE NOWSE YOU GOT A FEU EXTROM HERS ON YOUR CHIN OR SOMETHING IF YOU KNOW THAT SURE TESTOSTERON AS ELEVATED OR SOME OTHER ANDERGEN IT MI CHANGE THE ARK OF HOW YOU' TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF SO I THINK THAT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN YOUR TEANACHEARS IN YOUR TWENTIES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AS STRUSS CASE LIKE ME SO AGE TWENTY SEVEN ON THE WORDS AT YOU SEE AS AV IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS SUCH A HIGH CARTISALL PERSON I THINK I WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY I WOULD A CHANGE MY BEHAVIOR AND I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I DIDN'T BASECASE THESE BUT YOUR TESTOSTERON CAN DECLINE STRAIN YEUR TWENTIES CONE OF DEPENNYNG ON HOW MUCH STRESS YOUR MAD TRICKS ASUNDER SO FOR WOMEN THAT CAN START AS EARLY AS TWENTY EIGHT USUALLY YOU'RE TESTOSTEROAN DECLIENTS BY ABOUT WHEN PER CENT PER YEAR WHAT LEVEL OF TESTOSTRON DO YOU LIKE TO SEE IN A WOMAN ONCE SHE'S OR POST LESSAY AFTER AGE TWENTY FIVE WHAT KIND OF RANGE IS HEALTHY I KNOW WHAT THE REFERENCE RANGE IS ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW ONE COULD LOOK IT UP I DON'T KNOW YOUT THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND BEAGLY BUT WHAT WHAT'S AT CON OF A NICE REFERENCE POINT THERE SO THE WAY I NTEND TO DESCRIBE THE SON PID CASS IS THE TOP HALF OF THE NORMAL RANGE GREAT SO THAT I THINK IT'S A GOOD BENSMARK YOU KNOW FOR PISIO S GENERALLY IT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN PATIENCE WIT PISIO ASS WHERE THER TOTAL TESTOTRONS A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED DID I ALWAYS HAVE PER FER OLD MANIFESTATIONS O THAT LOL BIT OF HAIR THE THE SKIN PLAKS I'VE HEARD ABOUT YUSER DARKEN SKIN PLI REGULAR PERIODS REGULAR PERIODS IS THAT OM YOU MIGHT I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PICIO ASKE YA AM AND YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON WE'VE AD ON THIS POT CAST ATS RALLY QUALIFIE TO TALK ABOUT PICIO ASSEN IN A REAL WAY AM SO HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT TOO MANY ANDRERGENS SIST ON THE OVERY IRREGULAR OVERIAN MEANT SLAT A ASKIVNA KEEP SAYING THAT OBULATORY SLASH MENSTRUAL CYCEL AM WHAT ARE SOME OTHER INDICATORS AND DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT WOMEN START TAKING ANDRGEN BLOCKERS WHAT ISN'T WORE I MANHAW SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF PIECIO ESS OUT THERE O'M HEARING ABOUT IT A LOT SO GLOT YOU ASK BOUT THIS SO PECIOAS IS ONE OF THOSE REALLY POORLY UNDERSTOOD CONDITIONS THAT GETS IT CONAFLOWS FLIES BELOW THE RAT ARE UNTIL A WOMAN WANTS GET PREGNENT OR SHE'S GOT SOME OTHER ISSUE THAT DRIVES HER TO A PHYSICIAN THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS A SSINDRUM RIGTS SO POLYSISTIC OVER ESINDRUM SOMETIMES POLYSISTIC OVERARIAN SINDRUM AND CINDRUMS DON'T NECESSARILY FIT TOGETHER INTO A REALLY CLEAR DICNOSTIC CRIETERIA SO IN THIS INSTANCE THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT CRITERRIA THAT WE LOOK FOR SOS I ON THE OVERIES HAVING A CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF HYBER ANTRIGENISMS SO THAT COULD BE HERSITISM ACNY OTHER THINGS AND THEN USUALLY A REGULAR PERIODS AND THE WAY THAT THATS TO FIND AT LEAST BY THE A LATEST CRITERIA IS HAVEN'G A PERIOD EVERY THIRTY FIVE DAYS OR LESS SO TYPICAL PCYCAL LENGTH TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THIRTY FIVE DAYS U NOW YOUR SKIPPING A PERIOD HERE AND THERE SO THOSE WO THE THIS THE CRITERIA THAT WE USED TO DIGNOS PECOS THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OUT THERE IN THE LITERATURE FOR DICNOSING PICOES WHICH SWER ITS SARSKATE CONFUSING SO THERE'S SOME WOMEN WHO HAVE NO SIST ON THEIR OVERIES BUT THEY'VE GOT HERSITISM AND THEY'VE GOT IRREGULAR PERIODS COULD YOU DEFIN HERSOTISM YEURSITISM IS INCREASED HAIRGROTH USUALLY IN PLACES THAT YOU DON'T WANT IT SO FOR WOMEN IT CAN BE IN A KIND OF MAIL PATTERN THEY MIGHT NOTICE IT ON THEIR BREAST ON THEIR CHEST A AND THEN THERE'S OF COURSE A A FAMILIAL QUALITY TO THAT LIKE GOAS JUST LOOKING A PAPER LAST NIGHT LOOKING AT IS RALIES AND HOW MUCH HERSITISM TAY HAVE AND WHETHER THIS IS RELATED TO S  G REPEATS ON THE ANTRSEN RECEPTER DO THEY GET EM NOT IS RALLIES BUT AF DO WOMEN WHO AM WHO MIGHT HAVE PIECO S EXPERIENCE UM ENTERGENICALOPICIAS O HAIR LOST THIS SORT OF OF THE CUOLDEN COLD MAL PATTERN BALLNESS OF COURSE IT'S ANDROGEN PATTERN BALMNESS AS UPPOST A MAL THE WU AMET TOSTOSTRONDAGED HE RELATED SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THIS IS WHERE EMINENT IN VO CLINICAL EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN A WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE LITERATURE WOMEN DEFILIN CAN HAVE SOME ANTROGENIC A ALAPICIA I TEN TO SEE IT LATER IN LIFE BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUS WE THINK OF PIECIOAS AS YOU KNOW I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT IT IN TENAGE YEARS LIKE WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO KNOW THAT SYOU HAVE THIS PENATYPE IN YOUR RISK FOR ALL THE THINGS OF PEOPLE AR RIST FOR AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT LICOSIN INSLEN YET WE SHAID WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT PIECOASS IS NOT JUST TO PROBLEM IN TERMS OF IRREGULAR PERIODS AND THEN DIFFICULTO GE IN PREGNANT SO THOSE ARE MOSTLY PROBLEMS IN YOUR TWENTYS THIRTIES EARLY FORTIES BUT IT IS A MASSIVEROS FACTOR FOR CARTY METABOLIC DISEASE AS YOU COULD OLDER SO MANY PEOPLE TEND TO PITCEN WHOLE PIECUASS IS A PROBLEM OF RE PRODUCTIVE AGE WE HAVE TO BE THINKING OF IT OVER THE ENTIRE FEMALE LIFE PCYCHAL AND I WOULD SAY IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER IT OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY OU KNOW AVERTAGE OF MENAPOSIS FIFTY ONE TO FIFTY TWO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT ELEVATED TESTOSTRON THE HIGH ANDERGENS ARE PROBABLY THE GREATES CARDIE METPETABOLIC DRIVER OF DISEASE FOR WOMEN WITH PIECUESS WELL NOW ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION AND I STILL HAVE MY NOTES THAT WEREINTO TALK ABOUT MICEROBY IM TUSTING TO SET SUCH A FUN SUBJECT WHAT I WAS TAUGHT TO DO AGAIN SAYIG THIS WAS SO MUCH LOVE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAUGHT ME HOW TO DO MEDICINE WHAT I WAS TAUGHT TO DO IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A WOMAN WITH PIECIOES YOU MAKE THE DIAGNOSES YOU MEASURER TASTASTRON YOU SEE IF SHE HAS ACTME BLAVALA YOU ASK THAT WOMAN WON QUESTION DO YOU WANT T GET PREGNANT OR NOT SO THEN YOU HAVE THESE WOMEN WITH PIECUES WHO GET STARTD ON A BIRTH CONTROL BILL IF THEY DO'T WAN TO GET PREGNANT IF THEY WANT TO GET PREGNANT THEN YOU HELP THEM GET PREGNANT BY ADDRESSING SOMEODYSE PIESUESAS SHE IS LIKE MAYBE YOU GIVE THEM CLOMETT OR YOU DOU SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM MOVULATE MORE FREQUENTLY THAT IS THE WAY THAT MOST CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE APPURCHASES AND IT DOES WOMEN AT GIGANTIC DISSERVICE SO ONE OF THE THINGS OM SPEAKING INTO IS THE GENDER GAP THAT EXISTS SO I MY FEELING IS THAT THE RESEARCH MONEY THAT GOES INTO WOMEN'S HELF IS ABISMAL COMPARED TO WHAT GOES INTO MENSIL REALLY AND I THINK THAT'S CHANGING BUT THERE'S ALSO A HUGE LACK OF AWARENESS OF SECS IN GENDERA DIFFERENCES WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAY THAT WE CONSTRUCT CLYNICAL TRIALS AND OTHER EXPERIMENT WILL THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE I MEN I SIT ON I'VE SET ON AN ITRE VU PANNELS FOR MORE THAN DECATE NOW MREGULAR STANYNG MEMBER WHICH IS ONLY TO SAY THAT I SEE THE RESEARCH HAS IT'S BEING PROPOSED YES AND NOW IT'S REQUIRED NO GRANT WILL GET FUNDED WITHOUT SEC AS A BIOLOGICAL VERY BLY HER I'M BY THE WAY FOKSIS'S SEX BYLOGI SECS THE NOWN NOT SEC THE VERB BUT BOTH ARE SUPERINTERESTING OBVIOUSLY BUT UM WHEN WE SAY SECAS A BIOLOGICAL VARIABLE MEANING TE EVEN OF ITS A STUDY ON MICE WHEN I THAT START THOUGH THAT DIDN'T TART THAT LONG GO IT MUST HAVE BEEN I THINK WE CAN THINK IN WANT OF MISS ATTRIBUTE HERE I THINK WEAN THANK FORANCIS COLLINS FOR INSISTING ON THE SAME MAN FRANDAIS SO ANDRNITYAN PLALY BERNEDY AND HEALY HAS DONE SO MUCH TO HELP US BUT YOU KNOW SHE MADE THET WOMEN'S ALVINITIATIVE WHICH I HOPE WI'LL GET TO WHICH IS A HOT MASS LIKE SO CONFUSING THE DATA THIT CAME OUT OF THAT YET AN THESE TRIALS ARE LONG INSO THE DATE ARE ONLY NOW STARTING TO EMERGE SAID YOU SAY CLEAR AN I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I DON'T THINK IT'SGINGTO TAKE ASOV TRACK BUT THIS IS O'M ANIPPOSES QUESTION AS A HYPOTHESIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S LIKELY TO BE AA LITTLE BIT OF A OF A NOT A BARBED WIRE QUESTION BUT MAYBE LIKE A PRICKLY QUESTION WHEN PEOPLE FIRST HER IT BUT IT'S POSES A HYPOTHESIS YOU MENTION SOME OF THE PSYCLO SOCIAL STRESS ISSUES BASED ON AT THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL SOCIETA LEVEL MAYBE RIGHT DOWN TO THE FAMILY AND AND JUST LIFE THAT OUR BICING HEALTH OUT COMES FOR THE WORSE IN FEMALE POPULATIONS YOU REFER TO IS THE PATRIARCHY I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT MAKE SURE THAT WERE BOTH TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING AND THAT'S NON EXHAUSTIVE I REALIZED ATS JUST A SUBSET OF THE ISSUES I'M ALSO HEARING THRE'S A LOT MORE PICIO S WELH I IS HYPER ANDROGENESATION OF THE OVERY IN ITTHER RE TIGG BOUT YOU MENTION AT YOU EXCESS TESTOSTRONE WHICH FEMALES NATURALLY HAVE MORE TESTOSTRONE THAN THEY DO ESTROGEN ANYWAY BUT WHICH I AM ELEVATED LEVELS HERE'S A HYPOTHESIS ONE HYPOTHESIS WOULD BE THAT THE INCREASED ANDROGENS AND THE PISOA PICIO S ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PSYCLOSOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE I WATS A FORCING BUT OUR BICING THE NEED FOR FEMALES TO UM THINK BEHAVE REACT ACT IN CERTAIN WAYS TO SURVIVED LETTALONE THRIVE IS THAT I I DON'T SAY THIS FOR ANY KIND OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS HYPOTHESIS THIS IS A IN MIGHT THIS WOULD BE A FUN INTERESTING AND I THINK IMPORTANT STUDY TO RUN RIGHT DEPENDING ON STRESS AND THE CONDITIONS THE SPECIFTYPE OF STRESS DU FEMALES UNDER PRODUCE OR OVER PRODUCE ANDREWGENS OR IS IT A NEUTRAL EFFECT SAI MMAXENS I LOVE THIS QUESTION SO LET ME JUST PARIPHRASE THE LAST PART OF IT TO MAKE SURE AGOUT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHITH YOU'RE ASKING ES COULD PIECIO AS SORTLYS SOMEPHINATYPES OPIECIO S BE A RESPONSE TO WHAT I'M CALLING METERIKY AND THEN YOU ADD A SECOND PART TO IT WHICH IS TO HEALTHY WOMEN LIK WHAT IS THERE A PRODUCTION OF TOSTOSTRO LIKE IS THAT RIGHT YES AND AND WITH THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT O'M A YOU'RE THE EXPERT HERE AM YOURE THE PHYSICION CLINITION AND EXPERT IN HORMONES AND I'M NOT BUT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ABSOLUTE LEVELS OF HORMONES ARE INTERESTING BUT PERHAPS NOT AS INTERESTING AS THE RATIOS OF TESTOSTRONE TO ESTROGEN SO ONE WERE TALKING ABOUT EXCESS TESTOSTERONE WERE REALLY NOT TALKING ABOUT OH WOMEN MAKING LOT OF TESTOSTRON BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY ALREADY MAKE A LOT THAT THEN MOST PEOPLE WEREN'T AWARE OF THAT I WASN'T AWARE THAT WOMEN MAKE MORE TESTOSTRAND WE NEET EGEN RIGHT AND SO IT'S NOT SAYING THAT TESTOSTERON AND WOMEN IS BATTER IS ALWAYS A REACTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT YES BUT WHEN IT BECOMES AM SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL OR HYPER ELEVATED IS I COULD IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF SOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD CREATE THAT AM SO IN MA LES INFEMALES BUT HERE WERE TALKING MY PISOAS IN FEMALES IN PARTICULARS ID LOVE FO YOU TI SPECULATE UM SHWE RUN THE STUDY WE SEN TOTALLY RUN THE STUDY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER I SUSPECT THAT YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING IT MAY NOT EXPLAIN ALL OF THE WOMEN WITH PISIOAS BECAUSE AS I MENTION THERE S LOT AF DIFFERENT PHOENITYPES BUT I THINK IT COULD EXPLAIN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION AND YOU KNOW YOUARE ALMOST YOURE SEEING IF WE LOOK AT THE GENE ENVIRONMENT IN HER FACE THIS ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE OF HAVING BEIN SOME ONE WHO'S GOT POWER OVER YOU IF IF PISOAS WAS A RESPONSE TO THAT THE WAY THAT WE TREAT IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SO ON THE ONE HAND I WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DISMISS THE SUFFERING AND EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN WITH PISOAS I'VE GOT A LOT OF WOMEN WITH PISIOAS OF MY FAMILY AND IT IS THERE'S SO MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING YOU NOW ESPECIALLY IF YOU WON' T HAVE A BABY AND YOU TRY FOR YEARS AND YOU JUS CAN'T OFULATE ON THE OTHER HAND I READ A PEAPER RECENTLY IT MAY WE COULD SYPE THUS THAT COMPARES THE PHOENITYPE OF A WOMEN WITH PISIOAS TO A MAN WHO IS HYPO INTERGENIC AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING WAY TO LOOK AT THUS BECAUSE THE THREAD WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT WITH PISIOS IS THE THE ROLE OF INSOLENTANT GLICOS SO FOR SOME OF THE PHENITYPES OF PISIOAS THE PROBLEM IS HYPER INSOLENT EMIA HIGH INSOLENT IN THE BLOOD IS TRIVING THOSE THEKASULS IN THE ARES TO OVER PRETTIE TASTOSTRON THESE WOMEN ARE INSLENT INSENSITIVE SO MORE INSOLENCE BEING CRANKED OUT AND THE CELLS IN THE OVER YARE THEREFORE MAKING MORE ANDROGEN YOU DON'T LIKE TO SAY INSOLENT RESISTANT OH I I CAN A I DON'T HAVE A PROMISE A YES ARRS I IS I LIKE I OS AI SILEBUT OUTSIDE THE LANE LINES OF MY EX PARTISI I WAS TRYIN TO YOUS IT WHAT SORT IS THE CORRECTNOMEN CLATURE SO THAT WE CAN MATURE WHAT WOULD I LIKE ABOUT INSOLENT INSENSITIVE THE WAY THAT SHU JUST SET IT IS THAT I THINK THAT OFFERS PEOPLE AWAY AND AND I LOVE TO DO THAT IN TERMS A MESSAGING IN SULEN RESISTANCE STARTS TO LOSE PEOPLEKS THEY DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THAT MEANS TAT A RECEPTOR LEVEL I THINK I SAY INSOLENT INSENSITIVE BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE HERE INSOLENT SENSITIVE IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE A BAD THING BUT THAT'S I SHALLY WHAT YOU RANT SO I THINK I THINK THAT'S HOW I DEFAULT ED TO INSOLENT IN WHAT'S YOUR INSOLENT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN DO FOR A BLOOD TUS YES YOU ARE AM DO FOR BLOOD TES AM I HAD BLOOD WORK DONAARBU ANT AM SURE THEL BE GREAT I I A I'M ALWAYS O'M EXPERMENTING WITH DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENTS IN DIFFEREN BEHAVIORAL REGIMENTS AND I'VE KEPT CHARTS SINCE I WAS NINETEEN OH YOU'R LIKES MY PATIENT I HAVE BEEN SORT OF OF SESS BY THIS AND I WOULD SAY EVERYBODY IF YOU CAN AFFORDED AND AT THE TIME ACTUALLY I HAD TO SAVE UP INSURENTS WHEN COVER IT AM YET SOME BASIC BLOOD WORKD ONE SO YOU HAVE A REFERENCE DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBL BECAUSE EVEN YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE BEN TALKING ABOUT THESE WOMEN OVER THE LIFE CYCL I WISH I KNEW WHAT MY INSOLEN WAS WHEN I WAS A TEA NATUR I WISH  WISH I KNEW WHAT MY FASTININSELEN WAS I REALLY WISH I KNEW MY POSPERANDIAL INSOLEN LIKE IN MY TEEN EIGHT YEARS IN MY TWENTIES IN MY THIRTIES WHY KNEW IT AT MY THIRTYS STARTING AT THIRTY FIVE ARE YOU A FAN OF CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONERS THE YOU JUST MISS GIGANTIC FAN OF SEECIAMS I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY TOOL THAT 'VE EVER USED IN MEDICINE CHANGE BEHAVIOR THE WAY THAT SEECIAMS TO WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SO EFFECT OF AT CHANGING BEHAVIOUR I'VE TRIED ONE AND I REALLY LIKED IT I LEARN THAT I IN THE SANA MY INSOLEN TER MY BLOOD GLUCOS COS UP PROBABLY BY BIT OF THE HYDRATION I LEARN CON O FOOD'S WORK FOR ME WHICH DON'T UM I I THOUGHT ITS FASCIN LEARN HOWEVER YOU BEHAVIOUR YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE YOUS TAT YOUR IMAGINATION IMPACTS BLOOD GLUCOS TOTAS I TOLALLY FASCINATING TO ME INCLUDING HOW A TO WAKE WAKE UPSDURING THE MILL THE NIGHT VERSES ONE VERSES NONE IMPACTED BLOOD GLUCOS THE NEXT MORNING FASCINATING FOR A DATA JUNKEY LIKE ME IS LIKE I WAS IN HEAVEN IM WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SO EFFECTIVE IN CHANGING BEHAVIOURS IT BECAUSE OF THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT REAL TIME CONTROL LIKE SKIN IN AN LIKE OH THAT'S THE THAT'S THE SAME WHICH I THINK IT TOS I THINK ITS MANY THINGS I THINK IT'S GENERALLY THE ENCHANTMENT OF LEARNING ABOUT YOUR OWN CEMISTRY  TA I LOVE THA AND I THINK FOR ME WHAT I'VE SEEN YOU KNO I FEEL LIKE DOCTORS AURE BASICALY MARKETERS LIKE THE SECRED MARKETING LIKE AR JOB AS A PHYSICIAN IS TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS GOOD FOR THEM BASED ON THE BEST SCIENCE BUT WE CAN'T TO SAY HEROIN AS YO FILL IS PRESCRIPTION PORSYGIAM YOU HAVE TO MARKET IT YOU HAVE TO SAY I THINK THIS COMPLETELY CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOU APPROACH YOUR PREDIBEDES I THINK THIS COULD DRAMATICALLY A FACT YOUR RISK OF ALLSIMERS TYSY IS THAT YU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT THAT YOUR MOTHER HAS SO R JOB IS PHYSICIANS IS TO BE THAT SACRED MARKETER SO SEGIAMS ARE ONE OF MY TOOLS THAT I THINK ARE SO CRUCAL SO ENCHANTMENT NUMBER TOO YACHT IT'S THE REAL TIME OF FACT SO IF YOU GO GET YOUR GLUCOSININSELEN MEASURED OR MAYBE YOU DO LIKE A TWO HOUR GLUCOS CHALLENGE TAS WOR YOU LOOK AT GLUCOSININSOLEN AT THE FASTING POINT ON HOUR LATER TO HOURS LATER OR MORE FREQUENTLY THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME KIND OF BEHAVIOUR OF FCT AS HAVING CONTINUOUS STATA WHERE YOU CAN SAY OKE I DROVE TO SEE YOU ANDREW FROM MY PLACE IN BURKLEY AND IT WAS STRESFOL WAS TRENCHALLY RAINING AND I KNOW MY CLUCOS WAS ELEVATED LIKE I THINK REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE THE MEDEATERS ARE OF YOUR GLUCOS CONTROL IS ESSENTIAL NOW THAT'S SAID IT'S ALSO KIND OF A LATER OF FACT I MEAN I'D RATHER KNOW YOUR INSOLEN AND WE KNOW FROM THE WHITEHAD WHITE HALL STUDY THAT INSOLENT ESPECIALLY POST PRANDIAL ANSAND VASTIAN SAN TOO CAN CHANGE YERS IN YEURS BEFORE YOU GET A CHANGE IN GLICOS SO AM THAT'S MORE FOR PREDABETIESNT IBTIES SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAIN REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOOL THIRD THING IS A DEMOCRATIZES DATA WHICH YOU DO TO I MEAN INCREDIBLE IDETA WITH YOUR PODGOST BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST HOPEFUL AND EXCITING THINGS THAT I'M SEEN RIGHT NOW IN THE HALL SPACE IS THAT WE'RE GOING FROM THIS PATRIARICAL RELATIONSHIP WHERE DOCTOR'S WHOLE POWER AND ARE THE GATEKEEPERS AT DATA TO PATIENTS AND CLIENTS HAVING MUCH MORE ACCESS TO THAT ENCHANTMENT ABOUT THEIR OWN CHEMISTRY AND THEIR OWN BIOLOGY SO TO ME THAT IS SO EXCITING LIKE FOR ME TO BEABLE TO I'VE GOT YOU KNOW PROBABLY A HUNDRED PATIENTS THAT AR IN A DATA STRING WITH ME WHERE WERE LOOKING AT THEIR GLICOS AND I CAN I MEAN A MONSPATICALS OM NOT DOING THE SO MUCH ANY MORE BUT I CAN CALL A PATIENT BE LIKE WHY IS YOUR GLUGA SO HI LIKE WHAT DID YOU DO O IS MY BIRTHDAY I HAD A PIECE OF BERTHICIC LIKE THAT KIND OF COLLABORATION THAT ALSO IS TEACHING THE PATIENT TO BE THEIR OWN CLINITION TO ME THAT IS A LHOOP OF BENEVOLENCE AND INTEGRITY THAT I THINK IS ESSENTIAL TO CRATING HEALTH WE'VE GOT A DISEASE CARE SYSTEM WE MEED THE DEMOCRATIZATION AT DATA TO BACOMA HEALTH BASE SYSTEM A MEAN TO THAT A MILLION TIMES OVER A WE SHARE THAT A SEN TOMENT AT CANTELLIT AT A DEEP LEVEL I I THINK THE PANDEMIC AS SHE ASSISTED IN  HARM TO MANY THINGS BUT IT ASSISTED IN PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING THAT AM NO MAGIC FEIRY NOR THE GOVERNMENT NOR ANY ANY ONE WAS CAN ARRIVE AT THEIR DOOR WITH A KIT OF THINGS TO MAKE THEM HEALTHY RIGHT THA PROVIDE SUNLIGHT MOVEMENT SLEEP AND ALL THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF NATRITI NO NOTHING NOTHING THAT IT EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE ACCESS TO FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THEN IMPLEMENT THOSE THINGS AS BEST THEY CAN SPEAKING OF WHICH IN I'ME CIRCLING BACK TO THIS IDEA OF PEOPLE IN THEIR LATETEENS TWENTY SERIES AND ONWARD IF YOU AD A MAGIC WAND AND YOU COULD GIVE TWO OR THREE DON'T OR TO MAKE IT PERSONAL IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND ERACE CERTAIN BEHAVIORS BUT WHAT WOULD THE THE DON'T CATEGUORY BE AM YOU CALDN'T TELL US MORE THAN TWO OR THREE  BUT IF THE GOAL IS TO MAXIMIS VITALITY AND LONGEVITY THAN THOSE ARE NOT ALWAYS A PARALLEL TO ONE ANOTHER I CERAINLY NOT THE SAME THING SOMETIMES WORTH OGANAL BUT LET YUS SAY FERTILITY BEING A PROXY FOR VITALITY IN LONGEVITY A WILL SON AS FOREE OTHERS THAT FERTILITIES AND JUST ABOUT PEOPLE WONT TI CAN SEE CHILDREN IT'S ALSO IT'S AKIN SERVE AS A PROXY FOR VITALITY AND LONCHEVITY SO O WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE PATIENCE LET'S FOLCASS FIRST SOME FEMALE PATIENCE BUT UM IF IT EXTENDS TO MALE PATIENCE AS WELL WHELL YOU LIKE TO SEE THEM NOT DO YE WERE DO FAR LESS OF I REALLY LIKE THAT SO I WOULD SAY A FEW THINGS I'LL JUST SET MY THE THEN THAT WE CAN GO INTO DETAIL NUMBER ONE SLEEP I DO WHON A DIVERGE FROM YOU A LITTLE BIT ON SOME THINGS BUT SLEEP IS PROTTLY NOT ONE OF THEM TOUH WELL FEEL FREE AN HOUR THE ONE THAT WORKD A HUNDRED  O ON T RN HUNDR TEN OURS E  SLEEPE MIT THAT LES I GAN OI N LESS UNLESS YOU LIVED IN A DIFFERENT REALITY THAN I DO EM I YOU AND THEIR TIMES IN MY CAREER WHERE I WAS PULLING ALL NIGHTERS AND SLEEP TOPRIVE THEIR USIT I DON'T RECOMMEND IT BUT I DID IT AN I HOPE YOU DON'T DO THAT AMORE NO LONGER IF I CAN AVOID IT BUT THERE WERE YEARS MANY YEARS WERE IT WAS LIKE IT HERE WE GOIN I'M QUITE UM A DEPT AT IT FOR ONE CYCHAEL YE BUT TOO NIGHTS I CANNOT START TOFALL FALL  TOTALLY SO I WOULD SAY SLEEP I'LL CALL HI PERCEIVE STRESS ND I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT MAYBE UM THE DID ON TELL I YERS SOME WHAT WE NOW TO YOUD LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE GET ENOUGH SLEEP SO DON'T DON'TJUS YED NOT ALL OF THESE ARE CONCORDANT SO AM NOT ENOUGH SLEEP TOO MUCH AL LL TOO MUCH PERCEIVE STRESS EATING THE WRONG FOODS TALKSIC RELATIONSHIPS AND ISOLATION AND THE NUMBER SIX UM NOT MOVING ENOUGH FOR NOT MOVING AND EXERCISING IN A WAY THAT REALLY FITS WITH YOUR BODY SO TIS ART WITH THAT ONE ACTUALLY SHARE  S I SUCH A AND THEN WORK BACKWARDS AM I THAT'S INTERESTING I I I THINK NOWADAYS PEOPLE APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR QUOTIN CO CARDIO I KNOW THAT THE THE EXERCISE PHYSIOLITIS CRINGE AN AND DISSOLVE INTO A PUDDLE OF TEARS WHEN I SAY THAT BUT GETTING THE HART RATE UP OVER SOME PERIOD OF TIME LONGER THAN TEN MINUTES IN ORDER TO GENERATE CARTABASCOR HEALTH CIRCULATION SO AND RESISTANCE TRAINING OF SOME KIME MAY REFLEXIBILITY TWHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BODY FENA TYPE FOR AND EXERCISE I'LL SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE A WET I DID THROUGH I MAN I GAVE UP MY TWENTIES TO MEDICINE AND DURING THAT TIME I CASIONALLY GOT TO THE GIM YOU KNOW I YOU SEE US AT FROM PERNALSA YOU COULD GO TO THE GIM AND THEN AS SOON AS YOUR PEOPLE WENT OFF FOR YOUR BACK AN TO THE HOSPITAL BUT I IDN'T EXERCISE MUCH I HAD AM ORYEUMEMBER NORDIC TRACKS I HAD A NORDIC TRACK IN MY HOUSE AND NOW IS I WAS LIKE IT WHAT I BELIEVE BECAUSE FOR ME THE PRIMARY I'LL COME THAT I'M INTERESTED AND IS CARDY METABOLIC HEALTH SO WHEN IT COMES TO EXERCISE WHEN I REALLY FEEL IF WE ARE GIN TO BE AT A POPULATION LEBEL I FEEL THAT ABOUT A THIRD CARDIO TWO THIRDS RESISTANCE TRAINING IS BASED ON MY SYNT THISIS THE LITERATURE THE BEST COMBINATION AND I THINK THERE'S YOUKNOWAS YOU DESCRIBED WITH YOUR SIGING UAM STUDY I THINK THERE'S A MINMAL EFFECTOF DOSE WHICH FOR A POPULATION IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTES I THINK MOST OF US NEED A LOT MORE THAN THAT PAS PER WEEK R WEEK BUT I THINK OUNO FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE A THENATYPE THAT PRODUCE A LOT OF INSOLAN CIND A DEPENDING ON HOW I'M ON MY GAME I'VE A LOTOC GLUCOS SO I'VE TO EXERCISE A LOT MORE TO DISPOSE THAT GLUCOS SO I THINK YOU THEN HAVE TO MOVE FROM MEDICINE FOR THE POPULATION OR PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THE POPULATION TO WHAT WORKS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL I THNK THAT RECOMMENDATIONS FANTASTIC UM I THINK RESISTANCE TRAINING WELL LIN PUT THIS WAY UM NEITHER TRAINER NOR PHYSICIAN BUT I'VE SEEN IN FAMILY MEMBERS THAT WERE DOING I WOULN' SAY A LOT OF CARDIO BUT JUST CARDIO THAT WHEN THEY AD RESISTANCE TRAINING EVERYTHING INTERMS INCLUDING THEIR BILE MARKERS U HAVE IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY YES IS IN PARTICULAR FOR FEMALE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY BUT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE METEATORS THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO DO WHAT I CALL CHRONIC CARDIO WHICH IS WHAT I DID IS CORTOISAL SO WE KNOW THAT A RUNNERS SPECIALLY MARITHON RUNNERS PEOPLE WHO DO A LOT OF CARDIO AND DON'T DO MUCH RESISTANCE TRAINING THEY TEND OUT MUH HIH CORTOISAL LEVELS AND YOU CAN BUFF FOR THAT WITH VIDEM AN SEVIN IMAN SEE CAN DECREASE THE EFFECT BUT CHRONIC CARDIO DOESN'T ALWAYS SERVE PEOPLE SO QUICK PERSONAL EXAMPLE WHEN I FIRST T ARTED MEASURING FORMON PIANELS IN MYSALF I WENT TO MY PHYSICIAN AND I SAID I'M THIRTY FIVE I'VE HAD ONE KID I WON'T HAVE ANOTHER KID I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EXHAUSTED EN MY LIFE I JUST FEEL LIKE AN PUSHIN A ROCK UP TILL I'VE GOT THIS BELLY FAT THAT I DON'T LIKE AND AM I DI WANT OF SECS WITH MY HUSBAND SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT COUL WE DO ABOUT THIS AND HE OFFERED A BIRTH CONTROLPIL AND AN ANTI TO PRESEN GOODNES SO I LEFT HIM AND I WENT TO THE LAB AND I RAN A HORMON PIANEL AND MY CORTOISAL WAS THREE TIMES WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MY INSOLEN WAS IN THE TWENTIET I WAS FASTING MY GLUCOS WAS A HUNDRED AND FIVE MY FIRIED WAS MILDLY ABNORMAL MY PROJESTOR ON WAS LOW AND THAT SET ME ON THIS COURSE OF REALIZING THAT WHAT I WAS DOING AS A PHYSICIAN TAKING CARE ESPECIALLY OF WOMEN WAS NOT GETTING TO SOME OF THES R CAUSES THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL AND I WOULD SAY I HAD TO START FORSE WITH CORTOISAL AT THAT TIME I WAS RUNNING FOUR MILES THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR TIMES A WEEK TAT WAS JUST RACING MY CORTISAL FURTHER SO THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT EXERCISE FOR ME I EEDED MORE ADAPTIVE EXERCISE I SIR DOING POLOTIES MOR YOKA THAT HELPD TO LOWER MY CORTOISAL I MAN IT STARTED ME ON YOU NO CHANGING THE WAY I WAS MANAGING PERCEIVE STRUSS AN TALS TO CHANGE MY SUPPLEMENT RICHMOND IT CL WE TALK ABOUT THAT A'M WA WITH MOMA YOU SAID A LOWERING CORTOISALL THOUGHT OF AN THE TOO SUPPLEMENTS THAT COME TO MINE ARE A ASCHUAGONDA WHICH I THINK CAN POTENTLY REDUCED CORTOISALL BUT I'VE HEARD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT CYCLING IT A AND I'VE ALWAYS WONDER ABOUT TIME OF DAY FROSCHWEGONDA AND TAKE BECAUSE SORT OF QUARTICL WANT CARTOISALL ELEVATE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY YES AN WE KNOW THIS AH WE KNOW YOU DO NOT WANT CORTOISAL PIKING LATER IN THE DAY KNOW YOU DO NOT I INTERFERESELE SLEEP INTERFERES TO SLEEP IM AND AND THEN THE OTHER SUPPLEMENT IS A RODILO ROSATIA DO I MY PRONOUNCE IN NECCORTH YES SO RIDIOLA IS VERY EFFECTIF IT'S BEEN SHOWN AND MULTIPLERANOMIES TRIALS TO LOWER CORTOISAL SO THIT COULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE WHAT SORT DOS I'VE STARTED TAKING IT RECENTLY BY THE WAY AND I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE I LIKE TO MAKE THE MISTAKES FIRST SO THAN MY MONENCES DON'T MAKE THEM A AS I WAS TAKING IT I HEAR IT WAS AN ADAPTED GIN SO I THOUGHT I'LL TAKE IT BEFORE RESISTANCE TRAINING BUT OF COURSE YOU WANT THE CORTOISALL PEIC URING RESISTANCE TRAINING BECAUSE THAT'S GON A SETTIN MOTION THE ADAPTIVE RESPONSE I STARTING IT LATER IN THE DAY AND IT'S REALLY IMPROVED I WAS SIN MY LATE DAY SECOND HALF THE DAY COGNITION THIS IS SUBJECTIVE TO BE FAIR I JUST FEEL LIKE A MANY MORE EVEN PLAIN OF ATTENTION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY SO YOU'RE DESCRIBING AN AN OF ONE EXPERIMENT RIGT WHICH IS DATA IT IT WELL IT IT IS NOT ANECDOTAL SO I WAS TAUGHT AT OR  MEDICAL SQUAL THAT THE HIARCHY OF EVIDENCE STARTS THE LOWEST WITH EXPERT OPINION YOU KNOW KAS STUDIES THEN YOU'VE GOT COERD STUDIES THEN YOU'VE GOT A OBSERVATIONAL DATA THAT'S PROSPECTIVE THAN YOU FRAN I MIS TRIAL BUT THE HIGHEST QUALITY EVIDENCE OF ALL IS THE N OF ONE EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU SERVE AS YOUR OWN CONTROLL SO WHICH YOUR DESCRIBING WITH RODIOLA I WOULD FRAME THAT AS NANOBONE EXPERIMENT WE HAVE A WASH OUT PERIOD AND YOU COMPARE BEFORE AND AFTER AND I'D LIKE TO MEASURE SOME OTHER MATRICS TO SEE IF THERE'S IN EFFECT INCLUDING YOUR CORTOISAL SO RIDIOL HAS BEEN SHOWN IN MULTIPLRANIMISE TRIALS TO REDUCE CORTOISAL THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS SUPEREFFECTIVE IS PHOSPHITITL SEERING P S FOR SHORT FICHWOIL ALSO MORE MODESTLY REDUCIS CORTOISAL OSHWA GOND IS INTERESTTING SO IN MY FIRST PUK THE HORMON CURE WHICH I READ BY THE WAY YOU DID ID I WAS HOPING THAT WAS THE WHEN YOUR I DID I READ IT AND IT'S SPECTACULAR AND I THOUGHT GOING INTO IT I HAD THIS LIKE YOU KNOW I LET JUST CALL WHAT T WAS AS COME MAL BY US LIKE AS THERE CAN BE ANYTHING IN HERE FRAKAS A I'M I DON'T HAVE OVEREASAND YOU KNOWS AS SCOM Y AND IT WAS IMMENSELY IN FORMITIVE AM SA THANK YOU YA I HAVE VERY FOND RECOLLECTIONS OF THA THE WALKS I TOOK LISTENING TO IT AND THEN I OWN THE PRINT VERSION TO SO I LIKE TO SWITCH BACK AN FORTH SO THANK YOU FOR THAT IT'S A IT'S A PUR BOOK FOR ANY ONE TO REA Y I SO APPRECIATE THAT SO IN CHAPTER FOUR YOU MAY OR MAY NOT REMEMBER THAT OSHWAGONDA AT LEAST THE TIME THAT I WROTE THAT BOOK OSHWAGONIS TATA IS NOT GREAT BUT LAKA PROOF IS NOT PERFECT GAINST SO WITH OSHVAGONDA MOST THE DATA COMES FROM THOUSANDS OF YEARS IF YOU SEEN IT IN IVETIC MEDICINE AND IT'S CONSIDERED AGAIN NOT MY SCIENCE HAT IT'S CONSIDERED A DOUBLE ADAPTED IN SO THAT IT'S PETENTIALLY HELPFUL WHEN YOU ARE A HI CORTOISALPHINAT IP LIKE I WAS LIKE I SOMETIMES STILL AM OR LOW CORTOISAL I HAVEN'T FOUND THAT IN MY PATIENCE ALTHOUGHI'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXCEPTION SO OSCHAGONDA IS MOSLEY AS ON ANIMAL STUDIES THERE IS NOT AS MUCH HUMAN DATA BUT IT IS USED A TON IN ANYGREATIVE MEDICINE THE AM THERE'S ONE SUPPLEMENT THAT I'VE FOUND TO BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO TEN DA HIGH CORTOISAL AT NIGHT AND THAT'S CALLED CORTOISAL MANAGER I'S BY ANYGRAT THEIR PETICS I DON'T HAVE A SECOND AM SUPPLEMENT MANUFACTURE THAT MAKES SOMETHING SIMILAR IT'S THEIR NUMBER ONE SELLING SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE IT'S SO EFFECTI VISIT A COCKTALE OF SEVERAL IT'S A COMBINATION OF PHOSPOTITLE SERING AND OSCHVA GONDU TILL TELL ME MORE ABOUT PHOSPHOTITLE SERINA I 'M FAMILIAR WITH IT FOR IT'S BEEN MENTION BY SOME GUES THAT WERE ON THE TENPERIS PODCAST LONG AGO FOR OTHER REASONS I THINK RELY TO SLEEP YES OM AND MAYBE THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU LIKE IT THEM BUT BEFORE WE MOVE ON FROM RODIAL THE ZERADOSAGE OF RODIALORIZATION AT YOU SO I WOULD REFOR PEOPLE TO MY BOOK BECAUSE THE RANAMIZS TRIALS AND THE DOSES THAT WERE USED ARE IN THERE SO CAN'T REMEMBER WITH RODIOLA ALTHOUGH I TOOK IT THIS MORNING TO PREPARE TO BE WITH YOU WE CAN LOOK IT UP AND PA SHOW NOTE CAPTION I CAN REMEMBER THAT AS WITH PHOSPHOTILES ERIER ECAUSE I TAKE THAT REGULARLY SO FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED MILIGRAMS IS THE TYPICAL DIS FOR PS AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT IN THE RANAMIZS TRIALS THAT WERE DONE FOR ENDER MILIGRAMS WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED MILIGRAMS INTERESTING I'VE FUND THAT FOR SEVERAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT THE LOWER DOSE WAS MORE EFFECTIVE YES IM YE I WONT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THOSE WORE AND STO YE SEE P ZYOU REFERRING TO BY THE WAY FOLKS NOT P C O S JUST AS  SCIENTIST AN CLINATIONS ARE FAMILIAR WITH AN MILITARY VER FAMILAR WIT ACRENYMS A PHOSPHOTITLE SERING PAZA FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED MLIGRAMS FOR HUNDRED BE MORE EFFECTIVE TAKEN LATER IN THE DAY OR EARLY DAY DOES IT MATTER IT DEPENDS ON WHEN YOUR CORTOISAL IS IGH SO FOR ME I TEND TO IN AN WHAT'S THE PATTERN FOR CORTOISALL TYPICALLY IT RISES TO IT'S PIQE THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES AFTER YOU GET UP THEN IT HAS IS GRADUAL KIND OF ASEMTOTIC DECLINE UNTIL YOU GO TO BET SO IF YOURE SOMEWONE LIKE ME WHO PIKES LIKE WAY CRAZY HI I DON'T DO THAT ANY MORE BUT THAT'S WHAT I USED TO DO I NEEDOD PHOSPHOTILE SERING IN THE MORNING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGH AT NIGHT WHO HAVE WETS KNOWN AS A A FLAT CORTOISAL PATTERN OR A INVERTED PATTERN YOU WANT TO TAKE IT AT NIGHT AND THE FLAT PATTERN JUST QUICKSIDE BAR IS THAT THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS THAT MOST MAN STREAM PHYSICIANS DON'T KNOW ABOUT SO FLAT PATTERN WHERE IT'S LOW IN THE MORNING AND IT'S HIGH AT NIGHT IS SO SEE WITH ANXIETY DEPRESSION A DECREASED SURVIVAL FROM BREAS CAMPSER THAT WAS STUDID AT STAMFORD BY DAVID SPEAKLE THAS THAT HE WAS MY AM COLLAT CLOSE EVEN COLLABORATOR EVEN A ON THE BREATH WORK STUDY THAT WE O INTERESTING YE HE'S A ASOCIAT CURSYCHATRE NOWSO A WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING HAS A MAZES HAS BEEN A GUEST ON THIS PYCASS AN AND I'M NOW FANACIZING BY T A CONVERSATION THAT INCLUDES A A PANEL OF  O A INCREDIBLE MINES LIKE YOU AND DAVID FROM THE CLINICAL SIDE SO IN ANY CASE A YET THE LATE SHIFTED CUARTES ALL NOT TO GOOD NOT GOODAND IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE WORST A MUN DOWNSTREAM IS SUS OF ANY OF THE CARTOISAL PATTERNS SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE IT THEN MAPS TO THINGS LIKE AM IT'S RELATED TO PITIESTI SO THAT'S THE PATTERN WE SEE LIKEIN VATS WHO'VE GOT PETIESTY AS WELL AS OTHERS IT MAPS TO ODT IMMUNITY IT MAPS TO FIBER MALGA I WAS TOLD THAT ONE IN TWELVE PEOPLE AM HAVE OR HATTEROSIGUS SO ONE MUTEN COPY OR HYPOMORPHIC FOR SOME SOME MUTATION IN A DREANAL RELATED GENES O CAN GENERAL DREAMAL HYPER PLASIA IS THAT TRUE AND IF SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE AND TWELVE PEOPLE WALKING AROUND AR CRANKING OUT FAR TOO MUCH CUARTS ALL OR NOT ENOUGH ARTES ALL OR THE QORTIS ALL SYSTEM IS ALREADY SCEWED IN A DIRECTION THAT MAKES LIFE MORE CHALLENGING AT THE LEVELS WERE TALKING ABOUT AM DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY CAUSETHAT ONE AN TWELVE IS NOT A SMALL NUMBER IT'S NOT A SMALL NUMBER IT FITS WITH WHAT I SEE CLINICALLY I MEAN I'V ONE A SEE THAT ATA JUST TO SEE AM WHAT IS THAT MEAN AND COULD YO MODULATED WITH INVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES BUT IT'S CERTAINLY FITS WITH WHAT I SEE OUKOW I WAS TAT ONCE AGAIN AND MAINSTRA MEDICINE THAT IN TRUMS OF A DRNAL FUNCTION IT'S VERY BINARY HOW MOST CLINISIONS THINK ABOUT IT YOU EITHER HAVE ADISONS DOSEES AND YOU DON'T MAKE ENOUGH CARTUS ALL OR YOU'VE GOT CUSHINGS OR CUSHING WAID PATTERN AND YOU MAKE TOO MUCH QOARTUS ALL AND ANYTHING IN THE MIDDLE IS SNORMAL AND MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT HELL NOW LIKE THERE ARE THOSE OF US LIKE ME WHO MAKE A LOT OF CORTOISAL I DON'T HAVE CUSHINS MAYBE I'VE GOT ONE OF THESE I WOULDN'T CALL IT A MUTINTINE I WOULD CALL IT MORE OF A A VULNERABLE GENE SO MAYBE I HAVE ONE OF THIS MAYBE THAT'S PARTHE REASON WHY I MAKE YOU KNOW TWO TO THREE TIMES WHAT I SHOULD BE I'M AWARE OF A CERTAIN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS FROM WITH IN THE MILITARY SECTOR THAT UM HAP THERE'S OF MORE FREQUENT OCCURRENCE OF SOME MUTATION AND SSE AGE CAN YOU CON GENERAL DRANAL HYPERYOUT NOT A SILLY TWO COPIES WHICH WI IF PEOPLE LOOK THAT OUT THERE CAN A GO WHILE THERE'S ALL THESE IF PHENATYPES AND UM BUT SIR HYPOMORPHIC TYPE THINGS SO YOU KDON'T LESS THAN OR TOO MUCH CORTISALL AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT STAYING UP MULTIBLE DAYS PER NIGHT RIGHT A MOMULTIBLE NIGHTS IN SERIES SO THEY CAN PULL ALL NIGHTERS VERY EASILY YO THEY CAN PUSH HARDER WHEN MOST PEOPLE DQUIT AND OROE THINKS WELL THAT'S A GREAT PHINATYPE TO HAVE BUT GUESS WHAT IT'S BECAUSE THEY HYPER PRETTY CORTIS ALL YET AND UM SO THAT'S INTERESTING AND I THINK IF WE WERE TO PANEL MEDICAL STUDENTS AND GRADUAT STUDENS AND YOU WERE LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHO'S PULLING EXCESSIVELY LONG HOURS WHO STRESSED OUT A LOT IF EVEN OUTSIDE OF ACADAMIAN MEDICINE AND PUSHING PUSHING PUSHING REALLY HARD I THINK THE ABILITY TO PUSH AND NOT CRASH WE THINK OF IT IS ADAPTIVE BUT IN SOME SENSE IT'S MALADAPTIVE OVER SERIES OF YEARS WHICH HS OR WEWER YOU DESCRIBED EARLIER YET SUCH A GOOD PLANT BECAUS YOU KOW YOU IN SOME WAYS YOU WANT  SELECT FOR THAT AN CERTAIN PROFESSIONS LIKE AND THE MILITARY LIKE AND MEDICINE UM BUT I WOULD WONDER FOR THOSE FOLKS ABOUT THE DOWNSTREAME CONSEQUENCES A PRETTY SEEME SO MUCH CORTISALL  IT'S GOT A BE DETRIMENTAL FOR THER HIT'S GOT ANY LONG RUN AND AND YOU SEE THAT BUT HE'S 'N THE DATA SHOS THAT IF YOURE SOME ONE LIKE ME WHO MAKES SA LOT OF CORTISE ALL HIERATES A DEPRESSION LIKE FIFTY PERSON OF PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION NOWOF HIGH CORTIS A LEVELS HIRATES OF SUICIDE UM MUCH MORE METAPOLIC DISFUNCTION WE KNOW THAT TRAMA AS IN EXAMPLE MAPS TO AN INCREASE RISK OF CLUCAS METAPOLIS MISSES AND CERTAINLY HIG CORTISAL DOES THAT CAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE JOPS OF CORTISALL IS TO MANAGE A CLUKUS AND IT'S IT CON OF SUCH YOU UP FOR UM THIS WHEN NUMBER FIVE WHICHIS TOCKSIC RELATIONSHIPS OU KNOW SOME ONE WHO HYPER PRODUCES CORTISEALL IT'S HARD TO LIVE WITH SOME ONE LIKE THAT IT'S ALSO I WOULD STAY PEOPLE THAT HAVE THIS UM LET'S JUST CALL IT BIOLOGICAL RASILIENTS UM IT'S NOT ALWAYS ADAPTIVE BECAUSE YOU CAN STAY IN BAD CIRCUMSTANCES LONGER THE ABILITY TO TO CRASH PROVIDED 'S NOT SUISIDE OR LIFE LIFE DESTROYING OR YOU KNOW LONG ARC OF OF OF PAUS N THE REQUIREMENTS OF YOT TAKE TWO YEARS OFF FROM WORK OR SCHOOL OR SOMETHING UM THE ABILITY TO KEEP PRESSING ON AS IT IS A DOUBLE LITE SORT LET'S ASI EI UM I WANT TO MAKE SURE AN INSTANG WITHIN THAT THIS  CONVERSATION A BECAUSE YOU MENTION FOSEDILE SYRIAN WE TALKED ABOUT RERODIOLA RESATIA I SHOULD WE TALK A BIT ABOUT OSHREGONDA YOU'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT OMEGATHREES AND FISHAOIL IN PARTICULAR I LEVE TO KNOW YOUR FAVORITE SOURCES OF THESE I THINK NOW IDAYS ERS MORE GENERAL ACCEPTANCE THAT GETTING THESE ESSENTIAL PHATIACIDS IS IMPORTANT DO YOU HAVE A THRESHOLD LEVEL IOVE SORT OF GRAHAMS I I'VE ENCOURAGED A POTCAST LISTENERS TO CONSIDER DEPENDIN ON WHAT THEYRE EATING TO TRY AND GET A GRAHAM OF E P A ORN MORE PER DAY DOES IT SEEM EXCESSIVE  AND WHAT ARE THE REAL DATON EPS BECAUSE THEN THE A CARDYOVASCULAR EXPERTS ALWAYS HIT BACK AND SAY O NO YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD FOR CARDY O ASCULAR HEALTH THAN THE HEO LDS BETTER THAN ANTE TO PRESSENCE ANOTHER STUDIES IN  YOU KNOW SO I FEEL LIKE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE DIFFICULT YO ONE TA RAISE YOUR CUORTERSALL YOU GO ON TWITTER N YOU SAY SOMETHING POSSIVE BOUT O MAGA THREE AND A AND YOU LEARN A LOT A WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HA MEGATHREES I TAKE A LOT OF EM I'M ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN YE SO THE SWHERE I PERSONALINES I THINK SOME PEOPLE NEED MORE THAN OTHERS AND WHAT I DO IS I MEASURE YOUR LEVEL SO THIS GETS BACK TO UNOFISCIONAL DUSTING SO FOR YOU I WOULD JUST AND MAKE A QUANT OR WHEN O MY FAVORITE CARDY METABOLIC PIANELS IS TO DO A CLEVELAND HARTLAB SO I THINK THEY THEY GIVE ME THE MOST RELIABLE INFOMMATION NOT JUST WOR LET THIDS AN UP CLASSES AND YOU KNO AN AMARE FRACTIONATION BUT IT ALSO GIVES ME AN INSOLEN RESTANT SQORE IT GIVES ME A LEVELS OF A MAKA THREES I WE'LL PROVIDE LINKS TO THESE DIFFERENT GEITES SO THE PEOPLE BUT ONE QUICK THING ABOUT THAT THE WHOLE STORY IS NOT A MAK A THREES IN TAKING FISHWAIL SO THE WORK OF CHARLEY'S SIR HAN AT THE BRIKAM IS SHOWING THAT THE WAY THAT WE RESOLVE INFLAMMATION ARE UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS REALLY I THINK IN THE LEARNING TO CRAWL STAGE AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE A MAKE A THREE SIX PATHWAY IN THE BODY FISHWOILS CAN HELP YOU KNOW KUN OF PUSH THE REACTIONS IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION BUT TYPICALLY THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH FOR THE RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION NOW WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO INCLUDING MY AN BEA PLAYERS IS THEY POP AND I BEPROPHEN OR S SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEN THEY'VE GOT INFLAMMATION THAT'S GOT LOTS OF OTHER SID EFFECTS THAT ARE NOT SO GOOD FOR YOU AND WE KNOW IN TERMS OF THE RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION THAT TAKEIN SOMETHING LIKE I BREPROPHEN REDUCES THE AMPLITUDE OF INFLAMMATION BY ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT BUT THEN A POTENTIALLY BLOCKS THE COMPLETE RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION SO THERE'S THESE NEW SUPPLEMENTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF CALLED SPECIALIZED PRO RESOLVING METIATERS THERE'S LOT OF DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENT COMPANIES THAT MAKE THEN AND THAT COMBINED WITH FISHWAIL SEEMS TO BE THE BEST COMMINATION AND WHAT I DO FOR ATHLETES WHO'VE GOT NOW CON OF THE NORMAL ACS AND PAINS OF THE TRAINING LOAD THEY HAVE IS ALL COMBINE A LITTLE ASPRAN SMOLTIS JUST LIKE A EIGHTY ONE MILLIGRAMS IR DOIAS BABY ASPRAN TOGETHER WITH FISH WOIL PLUS SPECIALIZED PRO RESOLVING METEATERS AND THERE'S SOME THAT AR NASAF THEIR CERT IFID FOR SPORTS BUT THE THE DOSE I WOULD SAY WITH MY PATIONS SOME OF THEM ONLY NEED A THOUSAND MELEGRAMS YOU'RE GRAM THAT YOU MENTION FOR THE POPULATION SOME OF THEM NEED SIX GRAMS TOGETHER WITH SPIMS SO I THINK IT HOS TO BE PERSONALIZE HOW YOUNG UM IS IT O K FOR PEOPLE THO START TAKING O MAGA THREES AM FOR INSTANCE YOUNG WOMEN IN THEIR TEENS WEN THE'R TWENTIES IN THE THIRTES YOUNG GUIS IN THEIR TWENS AND THIRIES SHOULD THEY TAKE FISHWIL IF JUST AS A ASSUMING THE'RENOT CAN THEY GET ANYTHING TESTED OMETHING BUT THE COLLEGE STUDENT WHO IS REALLY INTO BILE MARKERS THAT SOR THEY WILL GO DO SOMS UM BUT MANY PEOPLE WON'T BUT THEY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO THEYLL TRYING DRINK A LITTLE LESS HOPEFULLY HOLEFLLY THEY WON'T SMOKEER VAP PLEASE DON'T SMOKE OR VAPE THE IDEA THAT VAPING IS O CAS LIKED WE HAD A LEVS SO BAD SO BAD  EVERYTHING WUR I LET AND THAT  AS I ER EXACTLY SO JUST YOU KNOW OF WHAT THEY THE OFULLY THEYLL TRY AND AVOID THOSE THINGS HOPEFULLY THEY'LL AVOID HARD DRUGS AM HOPULLY THEY'L AVOID GETTING ANY EST EYES IF THEY DO THEY'LL RESOLVE THEM QUICKLY HELPEFULLY YES IM SO BUT THEY MIGHT SAY A WELL CM WILLING TO IU NO TAKE SOM MAGNESIUM OR TAKE SOME FHOSPHODELE SEERING BUFF FOR MY QUARTERS ALL EAT SOME VEGETABLES AM SHOULD THEY CONSIDER TAKING FISHWOIL AS A KIND OF ACROSS THE BOARD I NOCULATORY THING SO I WIT TO RANK ORD ER THESE I WOULD SAY FISH WOIL YES I THINK A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS AS A GENERAL RECOMMENDATION IS GOOD BUT I'LSE HAVE A FOOD FIRST PHILOSOPHY SO MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE THAT THEY'RE HAVING SAMON OR SOME KUN OF SMASH FISH AND THEY'RE GETTING THAT AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE THEYARE MAKE A THREES AND THEN THE DAY IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE FISH I RECOMMEND IT PROBABLY TWICE A WEEK THAT THEY TAKE FISH WOIL THEN I WOULD PUT MAGNESIUM NEXT SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE DEFICION THN I PROBABLY PUT FIGHE HIM INDEED WHAT HOW MANY I YOU AVITIM AN DEEPER DAY WILL YOU KEEP ASK ME THUS IS LIKE FOR THE THE POPULATION N AT WELL FOR THE LEMME PUT THIS WAY FOR THE LAES FOR THE LAZY PERSON OR AND THIS IS AN OR NOT AN END AM OR THE PERSON WHO AM JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO GO GET MEASURE YEA LEVELS MEASURED CASETT EAT OR AUDIENCEIS A HUGE RANGE WE GOT A O CAN APTONSA DISPLOSABLE IN COME THAT LESS IN THE SPOT WE  BE LET NO DISPLOSABLE INCOME SO A THOUSAND A TWO THOUSAND IN NATIONALLY AND BUT MI YOU KNOW WHAT I DO AS I DOSE TO A SERUM LEVEL THAT'S BETWEEN ABOUT FIFTY AND NINETY GREAT AND SO I HAVE A FIGT IM IN DEE RECEPTER A SNEP AND SO I NEED TO TAKE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND A DAY TO GET TO WHAT I NEED A LOT O PEOPLE DON'T NEED THAT AND OU KNOW THERE'S SOME SUPPLEMENTS THAT I DO'T KNOWIF THEY NEED SO YOU MENTION FOSPITILES SEERING FOR SOME ONE WHO'S A COLLEGE STUDENT AND THEY'RE CORTISALS COMPLETELY NORMAL THEY'RE WAYSTIN THEIR MONEY ON PS THEY DON'T NEED IT THEY MIGHT NEED IT LATER BUT THEY DON'T NEED IT NOW I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CIRCLE BACK TO BIRTH CONTROL IN PARTICULAR ORALL CONTRACEPTIV BIRTH CONTROL AND WE SHOULD TOUCH ON A YOU IES OF PERHAPS WILL BIT MORE BUT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON OR PURE ESTERGEN BIRTH CONTROL IS WHAT I LEARN WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGES THAT BIRTH CONTROLAS BASICALLY TONIC ESTERGEN SO CONSTANTLY TAKING ESTERGEN ESTERGEN WOMEN ORE TAKING ESTERGEN SO THAT THEY DON'T GET THE ESTERGEN PRIMING OF PROGEST YOUR OWN YOUR NOCANG IN ANY OVULATION AND I'VE KNOWN WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING ORALL CONTRAGR THAT TOOK IORAL CONTRACEPTION IS LIKE ESTERGEN PILLS BASICALLY FOR FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS ARE THERE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THIS AS IT RELATES TO PREGNANCY PECI LES MEN APAUSE WHAT IF SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE CONSEQUENCES A WHAT ARE YOU CONCERNS WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES WHAT YOU DISLIKE ABOUT THEM I LIKE HOW BALANCE YOU ASK THAT QUESTION SO WOMEN WHO TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES AS LONG AS YOURE DESCRIBING LIK TEN YEARS AR LONGER WEVE CALL THOSE OLYMPIC ORLL CONTRACEPTIVE YUSIRS IN TERMS OF BENEFIT I THINK THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT AND EVEN NOW IT GIVES WOMEN REPRODECTIVE CHOICE AND TOTS ESSENTIAL AS YOU MAY KNOW OUR REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE TO SPEND DECLINING RECENTLY SO I'M A BIG FAN IN THAT REGARD AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF DATA TO SHOW BOTH THE RISKS AND ALSO THE BENEFITS OF IT SO I'LL SPEAK FIRST INTO THE BENEFITS BECAUSE A AMENTY GET ON AS A BOX A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RISKS SO WE KNOW THAT IT REDUCES THE RISK OF A BEARING CANCER SO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IDEA OF INCESSANT OPULATION THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE FEMALE BODY SO IF YOU LOOK AT FOR INSTANCE WOMEN WHO ARE NUNS WHO I DON'T TAKE RALL CONTRACEPTIVES AND THEY HAVE A PERIOD EVERY SINGLE MONTH OF THEIR REPRODECTIVE LIVES THEY HAVE A GREAT A RISK OF A BEARING CANCER SO IF YOU LOOK THEN AT WOMEN WHO HAVE A SEVERAL BABIES AND THEY'VE GOT A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THEY'RE PREGNANT THATHEY'RE NOT OPULATING AND TAND THEY BRESFEED FOR SOME PERIOD OVE TIME THEY'VE A LOWER RISK OF IF ARING ANCER SO ORALL CONCIOUS CONTRACEPTIVES HELP WITH REDUCING OPULATION AND REDUCING RISK WE KNOW THAT IF YOU TAKE THE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS IT REDUCE TO RISK OF A BEARING CANCER BY FIFTY PER CENT AND THAT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE'RE SO POOR AT DIKE NO SEEN ABEARING CANCER EARLY THERE'S REALLY KNOW METHOD THAT'S REALLY EFFECTIVE WE USE SEE WEN TWENTY FIVE AND ULTER SOUND SCREENING E SPECIALLY AND WOMEN WHO ARE AT GREATER GNETIC RISK BUT EVEN THAT OFTEN WE DICNES IT YOU KNOW IN A LATER STAGE MAYBE JUST BECAUSE THAT STAEMENS GOING TO HIGH LIGHT FOR A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE QUESTION OF WHAT ARE SOME OF THIS AN EARLY EST SYMPTOMS THAT PEOPLE CAN RECOGNIZE WITHOUT A BLOOD TEST SO AS OVERYING CANSERAS IT CAN BE PAIN SO THE PROBLEM IS THE SYMPTOMS ARE SO IG AND THERE'S SO NON SPECIFIC ON OF THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS IS BLOATING AND WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT CONSTIPATION WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR WOMEN HAVE THIS LONGER TRACK GI TRACK AND SO BLOATING AS A REALLY COMMON EXPERIENCE FOR MOST WOMEN YOU CANNOT BULK SYMPTOMS SEEN OF FEELING MIKHT YER YOUR LOWER BELLY IS CON OPRESSED OUT SO THE WAY THAT WE IN FORM WOMEN IN TERMS A WATCHING FOR THUS IS TO GET REGULAR GON ACOLATIC EXAAMS UM FOR WOMEN WHO ARE AT HIGH RIS WHERE THEY HAVE FOR INSESTANCE NOLT FOR SOUND FOR SOME REASONAS A MASS THAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THERE'S A WAY TO TREASH THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF A VALUATION THAT THEY NEED AND THAT'S E SITUATION WHERE YOU MIGHT GET A BLOOD TUSS CALLED THE SA WENT TWENTY NINE SEE I WEN TWENTY FIVE THE UM YOOT THE PROBLEM IS THE SYMPTOMS ARE SO VAGUE IT COULD BE IT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE TUMORIS SO MUCH BULK YOU HAVE WHAT IT'S PRESSING ON SO IF IF UM TAKING ESTERGEN AND THEREBY REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF OVULATION LOWERS THE RISK OF A VERYING CANSWER SHOULD WOMEN THAT ARE EVEN WOME WHO ARE NOT SEXUALLY ACTIVE SO THEN THEY'RE NOT ACTUVALLY TRYING TO GET PRINAN OR AVOID GETTING PRITNIN BUT IF HE'RE NOT SEXUALLY ACTIVE THAN THE PROBABILITY OF CONCEIVING UNLES THEY GO THROUGH E SOME IU IY OR SOME OTHER ROUT IS IS VERY LOW AS FAR AS I KNOW UM SWAS TAUGTON HIGH SCHOOL ANY EM WOULD THEY BE WISE TO SUPPRESS OPULATION FOR PERIODICALLY USING HORMON BASE CONTRACEPTION JUST SO THAT THEY CAN OFFSET THE RISK OF AVERYING ANSER THAT'S A VERY RATIONAL QUESTION AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S WHAT MEANS TRY MEDICIN HAS HAD AT ITS BACK TO RECOMMEND ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES NOT JUST FOR WOMEN WHO ARE SEEKING CONTRACEPTION BUT FOR ACNE FOR PAINFUL PERIODS FOR REALLY CANOTHER DROP OF I HAT THEY'RE PRESCRIBING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOUT TO DO BUT THERE'S SO MANY CONSEQUENCES AND I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS MORE ABOUT CONSENT BECAUSE IN NOBE GOU ANN AND I STERTED OUT AS BORT ERVITE OPE TOU ANN AND I NOW MOSTLY SEE MEN BUT I WAS TAUGHT AS NEWBETOU AN TO CONVINCE WOMEN TO GO ON THE ORL CONTRACEPTIVE AND I THINK A LOT OF HAT IS FORMASITICAL INFLUENCE SO MAY WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE RISKS AND WHY THE ANSWER IS NOW TO YOUR QUESTION M AS WED DO THAT COULD I JUST ASK IS THE ON THE SO CALLED A RING THE NEW USED TO BE CALLED THE NEW FOR RING ME THAT'S A BRAND NAME BUT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGEAS ALL WAYS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RING I BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN FOR REASONS IT THAT I DON'T BELONG ON THE PODCAST UM I'S YOUR IMAGINATION FOLKS SO EM IS THE RING OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT A ORLIT'S NOT A ORLHORN ON  CONTRACEPTION BUT IT'S HORMON BASE RIGHT THE RIT IS TE LEASING ESTEROGEN LOCALLY AS SUPPOSE TO TAKING IT ORLY BUT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU SLOT UNDER WHA YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL US IN TERMS OF THE CONCERNS SO WE'VE LESS DATA ABOUT THE RING SO THE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE IS TWO HORMONS IT'S EPHANIEL ESTRADILE AND IT'S A PROGESTAN SO IT'S NOT THE NORMAL A PROGESTERON THAT YOUR BODY MAKES SA TUROVERESE MAKIN YOUR DREANALS MAKE IT IS A SYNTHETIC FORM OF PROGESTRON AND IT IS THE SAME PROGESTAN SIMILAR THE SAME CLASS THAT WAS SHOWN TO BE DANGEROUS AND PROVOCATIVE IN THE WOMEN'S HELF INITIATIVE SO I'M NOT A FANA PROGESTNSE I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM FOR ANY WOMAN UNLESS THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT TAKING THEM IS SURGERY OR SOME OTHER A YOU KNOW UNLESS IT IT GIVES THEM SOME FREEDOM IN SOME WAY SO I DON'T LIKE PROGESTANSE THE A NEUVE RING IS ESTRAGAN PLUS PROGESTAN BUT IT'S RELEASED TRANSTERMALY THROUGH THE VATINA SO GIVEN THE THE WAY THAT A IT'S DELIVERED TO THE VAGINA THE DOSES ARE LOWER THAN WHAT'S TAKEN WORLDLY BUT IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE RIS TAT UM BAC TALK ABOUT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT MUCH TO THE DATA WE THINK THAT IT'S SIMILAR THERE'S PROBLIES SPECTRUM OF RISK AND THE NEUVERANG IS A LITTLE MORE TOWARDS THE MIDDLE THAN YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WITH ORAL CONSCISEPTIVES A READY FOR THAT YE I'M READY FOR THE RISKS OGE SO LIKE WITH ALMOST ANY FIRMACITOCAL THE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE TO PLEADS CERTAIN MICRINUTRIANCE SO MAGNESIUM THERE CERT INVITEMENT BESER DEPLEADED A IT ALSO EFFECTS THE MICROBIUM THAT DATA IS NOT AS STRONG BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME EFFECT IN THERE'S ALSO AN INCREASE RISK OF INFLAMMATORY BALDYSIES IN AUTOMEAN CONDITION IT INCREASES INFLAMMATORY TONE SO THE STUDIES THAT I'VE SEEN INCREASE ONE OF THE MARKERS OF INFLAMMATORYTONE HISENSE TO BE SIARP BY ABOUT TWO TO THREE ACTS ITS SEEMS TO MAKE THE HYPOTHLAMIC PETUITORY A DRENAL AXIS MORE RIGID SO THAT YOU CAN'T KIND OF ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES AND WAXON WAIN AND TERMS OF CARTISAL PRODUCTION THE WAY THAT YOU CAN OFF THE BIRTH CONTROLPILL IT CAN AFFECTS IRID FUNCTION I'M THINKING OF THE SLIDE THAT I HAVE THAT AS LIKE TEN PROBLEMS SASSISTED WITH THE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE BUT THAT'S WHAT I CAN REMEMBERATA THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND IT MAKES ME WONDER WHETHER OR NOT IF ON THE ONE HAND RL CONTRACEPTIVE OR PROTECTIVE IN WOMAN IT'S A VERYINCANCER BUT THAN THE HAVE THESE OTHER ISSUES YE OTHERE'S ONE OTHER I WANT O MENTION PLEASE AND YOU TIME YOU TAKE ORAL ESTRAGAN IT RAISES SECWORMON BY NIGLOBULAN AND YOU'VE TALK TO OTHER PODGASCAS ABOUT THIS CILE I THINK SECWORMAN BINDING GLOBULAN I THINK OF AS A UNCH THAT SO SEP FREE ESTERGEN AND FREE TESTOSTRON SO WHEN YOU GO ON THE BIRTH CONTROL BILL YOU RAISED YOUR SEXWORMAN BINING GLOBULAN IT'S SO SUP ESPECIALLY FREE TESTOSTRON AND FOR SOME WOMEN IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL THEY DON'T NOTICE MUCH OF A DIFFERANCS BUT THEN THERE'S A PHINATYPE MAYBEYOU RELATED TO SE G REPEATS ON THE ANDERGEN RECEPTER WHO ARE EXQUISITELYST SENSITIVE TO THAT DECLINE IN FREE TESTOSTRON SO THIS THEN OPENS THE PORTAL OF TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TESTOSTRON AND WOMEN SO WE'VE MENTIONED ALREADY THAT IT'S THE MOST ABUNDANT BIOLOGICALLY THE MOST ABUNDANT WORMON IN THE FEMALE SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH MEN MAKE ALMOST TEN TIMES AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN TEN TIMES IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN IT IS ESSENSIAL TOU SO MANY THINGS NOT JUST SEX DRIVE IN MUSTLE MASS AND SEEN A RESPONSE TO RESISTANCE TRAINING BUT ALSO CONFIDENCE IN AGENCY AND SO THOSE WOMEN WHO ARE SO SENSITIVE TO THEIR TESTOSTRON LOBELE THEY'VE GOT THIS HIGH SEXWORMON BINDING GLOBULA IND THEIR TESTOSTRON DECLINES WHAT THEY DESCRIBE IS VAGINAL DRYNESS MAYBE A DECLINE IN SEXTRIVE BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS BIGER ISSUE RELATED TO CONFIDENCE IN AGENCY EVEN RIST TAKING FROM STUDIES THAT WE'VE DONE WITH EMPYA STUDENTS THAT I THINK IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTAN OUT OF ALL OF THESE THINGS IS THAT IT CAN SHRINK THE CLERIST BY UP TO TWENTY PER CENT TWENTY PER CENT AND THAT INCLUDE I A REGRESSION F THE OF THE NERVES AN INTERVATE THE THE CLITERS IS AT I MEN  THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AS IN NURO SCIENTISTY I WOULD THINK OF YOUSE TO TICYA THE NORAL SIDE OF OF REEDUCTIVE HELT WE NEED YOU A ERIES ON SEXUALT MAY BOU COHOSE THAT WITH THER I WE COULD CERTAINLY EAS YOUR EXPERTESE I THINK M YET THAT'S A DRAMATIC THESI DRS A AT UMBER YAT BUT THEN LET'S GO BACK TO THE SACRED MARKETING IF I'VE GOT A WOMAN THAT I THINK SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BIRTH CONTROL BILL MADE BE STAKEN IT FOR ACTNIN ORS TAKIN IT CAUSE HER PERIODS WERE A LITTLE PAINFUL WHAT A MONA DE IS SAY LET'S LEVERADGE THESE OTHER WAYS OF MAKING YOUR PERIOD LESS PAINFUL LET'S TAKE THE MESSAGE OF EUR PAINFUL PERIODS AND FIGURE OUT OCATES AT YOUR INFLAMATORY TONE AND WE GIVE YOU SOME FISHOIL N ES PIMS MAY BE A LITTLE ASPRAN WHEN YOU GOT YOUR PERIOD LIKE LET'S FIND SOME OTHER WAYS TO DEAL WITH IT THEN TO TAKE THE ORLD CONTRACEPTIVE WHICH YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED IN FORM CONSENT ABOUT BECAUSE IT CAN TRINK YOUR CLIT BY A TO TWENTY PER CENT NOW THAT USUALLY CONVINCES MOST PEOPLE TO DOMBER ROVERSIN THE ELEVATION IN SEXORMON BINING GLOBULAN DOES NOT SEEM TO GO AWAY WHEN YOU COME OFF THE BIRTH CONTROLPEM TO ME THAT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH PROSCRIBING ORL CONTRACEPTIS NOW THE DATA THAT WE HAVE IS LIMITED THERE'S ONE WOMAN WHO A CLODIA SOMETIN SOMETHING WHO LOOKED AT SEXWORMON BINING GLOBULAN A YEAR OUT FROM STOPPING THE BIR TH CONTROL PILL AND IT WAS STILL ELEVATED IT WASN'T AS HIGH AS IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE ON THE PILL BUT IT WAS STILL ELEVATED SO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT REVERSIBILITY I DON'T KNOW IF WE KNOW THE ANSWER THAT WELL OK UM THAT'S THE O THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT AND SOMETHING THAT FOR CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THIS ALTHOUGH THIS MIGHT SEEM NOT RELATED IT IS HOW EARLY DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT WOMEN GO GET THERE FOLICAL NUMBER ASESSED IN OTHER WORDS TO GET A SIZE A SENSE OF THESCIZE OF THE OVARIAN RESERVE AND THEIR A MH LEVELS O MEASURED U AMNIT A'M AN AMATEUR OUTSIDER AS I SAY THIS BUT WE HAVE AN EPISODE ON FERTILITY RI JUST DESCRIBE THE OVULATORY MENSTRAL CYCLE YEUM AND I'M NOT THE BEST PERSON ANS BO YET WELL WE CON TOO FAR OUT FROM IT OK WILL CUM SPPOSE THEN FROM TAKING THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEBODY WHO THINKS ABOUT FERTILITY IT IN TERMS OF AT LEAST CONGRUENT WITH BYTALDY AND LONCHEVITYA WOULD GIVEN THAT IT'S FAIRLY NON IN VASIVE S AN ULTROSOUND OR AND A BLOOD DRAWFR M H FOR BOTH IS THERE ANY REASON WHY WOMAN WOULD NOT WANT TO GET HER FOLICAL NUMBER CASSED OR HER AM H LEVELS SASSSSED IS THERE ANY REASON WHY BECAUSE I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT MOST WOMEN DON'T DO THIS  TILL THEIRE HITTING THEIR LATE THIRTIES OR EARLY FORTIES AND THE OTHER HAVENT CONCEIVED OR THEY SUDDENLY DECIDE THAT THEY WANT A ONCEIVEN I THOUGHT WHY DOESN'T EVERY DOCTOR INSISTED THEIR FEMALE PATIONTS  HAVE THEIR  MH LEVEL ADDRESSED SO THAT IF THEY NEED TO IT'S CREES EGGS IS A COSD IT'S COST YES SO I THINK IF YOU'VE GOT THE DISPOSABLE INCOME TO DO IT GO FOR IT IT'S NOT INCLUDED A STANDARD BLOOD PANNOW WELL THE ONLY WOMEN IN MY PRACTICE WHO'VE HAD AMAH ASDON AND NEF LOOKED AT THEIR FOLICAL COUNT ARE WOMEN WHO WANT I FREES THEREGGS OR AN THAT REQUIRES DISPOSAL INCOME OR THEY AM ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING PRAGNANT SO THEY ARE IN THE REPRODUCTIVE ANTE CHRONOLOGY SYSTEM AND THEIR GETTING AND EVALUATION AND THEN THEY'RE ALSO AM THE WOMEN WHO HAVE SYMPTOMS OF EARLY MENAPAS SO PREMATURE A VERYIN ANSUFFICIENCY WHICH IS BEFORE ACH FORTY A THOSE OLY WOMEN THAT I SEE GETTING ATUSTED AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT SHOULD BE OFFERED MORE BROADLY IT SPEAKS TO THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF DATA AGAIN AND I THINK MOST WOMEN DON'T KNOW THAT SO YOU'R DOING A HUGE SERVICE I THINK TO BE SPEAKING INTO THIS WHONE OTHER POINT RELATED TO THAT IS THAT WHAT I SEE IN CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE IS THAT WHEN A WOMEN ASKED FOR HORMON PANEL AND SHE'S NOT TRYING TO GET PREGNANT SHE USUALLY GETS TOLD THAT WHORMEN'S VERY TOO MUCH IT'S A WAYS TO MONEY YOU DON'T NEED IT OR IF YOU'RE FEELING HORMONA WHEN I'T YOU GONE O BIRTH CONTROL BIL UNLESS SHE'S TRYINGTO GET PREGNANT IF SHE'S TRYING TO GET PREGNNT SUDDENLY THOSE SAME TES ARE VERY RELIABLE AND THEY GET YOU KNOW THE'RE THEY'RE TESTOSAR ON THE FREE TESTROSTEROUND THEIR THIROID PIANEL THEY GET THER ESTERGEN PROGESTERON MAYBE THEY GET THEIR CORTUS ALL THEY GET THEIR AMATE SO THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD BETWEEN THOSE WHO WANTING A PREGNANT AND THOSE WHO DON'T AND THAT MEET STEND YEI TOLLY AGREE AS I'VE LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM OVULATORY CYCLE AN AIMATION AND THE ANTERAL POPULATION OF FOLICLS ON IT'S FASCINATING IT TO SEEMS TO ME WELE RELATIVELY STRAIGHT FOR A TEST ONE DEFILY NVASIVE ULTERSOUND BUT AND I CONSIDER THAT YE A NOT A NOT TERRIBLY INVASIVE BUT INVASIVE A LEAST BUT THE OTHER ONE JUST PURE BLOOD TEST JUST SEEMS  WHY WOULDN'T I WOULD THIS BE OFFERED ORCOVERED BY ANSURANCE OR OR YOU KNOW THAT ANY ONE THAT WANT IT BUT NOW NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU MENTION MEN APAUS HUGE TOPIC ENORMOUS TOPIC A WE HAD A GUESS ON THE PODCASSUS NOT A CLINITION WHO SAID SOMETHING IN PASSINGS O I WON IT I LIKELY TO GET THIS WRONG UM BUT WHAT THEY SAID WAS THAT THE RESULTS OF THE LARGE SCALE TRIALS ON HORMON REPLACEMENT THERAPY FOR WOMEN FOR MEN APAUS SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF IF THE HORMON THERAPY WAS STARTED EARLY ENOUGH IT WAS VERY BENEFICIAL FOR YES VITALITY IN HEALTH OUTCOMES WHEREAS IF WOMEN WHEN THROUGH MEN APAUS AND THEN INITIATE THE HORMON THERAPY HORMON REPLACEMENT THERAPBY THAT IT COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR HEALTH SO FIRST OF ALL I DO I RECALL THAT STATEMENT CORRECTLY AND THEN SECOND OF ALL WHAT SORTS OF HORMONES ARE BEING REPLACED IS IT JUST ESTERGEN AND HOW IS THAT DONE IS IT DONE THROUGH BIRTH CONTROL THAT SO ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES NEUVERINGS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON MENAPAUS WHEN SHOULD PEOPLE START THINKING ABOUT IT AND WHAT IS THE PALAT OF THINGS AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE YOU ONON THIS TOPIC IN THE FUTURE BUT JUST TO I UN I GET LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND AND I'M GUESSING THEY SON EVERYTHING YOU'VE TOLD ME TO DAY THAT THERE ARE WOMEN IN THEIR THIRTIES THAT WHILE THEY MAY BE TWENTY YEARS OUT FROM MEN APAUS PROBABLY SHOULD BE DOING THINGS NOW IN YESITATION OF THAT YES SO WE'VE BEEN TALKED ABOUT THE THIRTY SOMETHING BUT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THE MORE YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR PHINA TYPE YOUR HORMONAL PHINA TYPE WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR THIRTIES YOU'RE SET UP IN TERMS OF WHAT DO IN THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY THINGS LIKE YOUR THIROD YOUR ESTERGEN PROGESTERA LOVELS CAUSE YOU CAN REPLACE HU A STATE OF YOUTHIRIGHT WHATEVER THAT IS FOR YOU YOU CAN REPLACE I DON'T USUALLY GO EXACTLY BACK TO WHERE TH ESTERGEN PROGESTERA LOVELS WERE WERE BUT WE CAN GET PRETTY CLOSE SO IN YOURE THIRTIES HAVING A BASE CASE I THINK IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL SO YOU SPOKE TO THE WOMENS HALP INITIATIVE WHICH WAS PUBLISH AND TWO THOSIN TOO AND WE WENT FROM A HUGE NUMBER OF WOMEN TAKING HARMON THEREBY TO A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE LIKE IN THE RANGE OF FIVE PERCENT AND THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT MILLIONS MILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO ARE SUFFERING NEEDLESSLY WITH THINGS LIKE IN SOMNIA DIFFICULTY WITH THEIR MOOD DIFFICULTY WITH SEXTRIVE A FEELING LIKE THEY ARE CLOHSIN THE STORE IN TERMS OF SEX BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ON HAORMONTHEREPY I WOULD AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT SHE MADE THAT HAORMON THEREBY PARTICULAR FORMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO WHICH HER BODY ALWAYS MADE WHEN IT'S GIVEN JUDICIOUSLY AT THE RIGHT TIME TYPICALLY WITHIN FIVE TEN YEARS OF MENAPAS WHICH IS FIFTY ONE TO FIFTY TWO THAT IT IS INCREDIBLY SAFE SO IT'S A COMPLICATED STUDY THE WOMEN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE BUT IT WAS THE THE WRONG STUDY IN THE WRONG PATIENCS WITH THE WRONG MEDICATIENS AND A WITH SOME OF THE WRONG OUTCOMES SO WAS POWER TO LOOK AT CARDY VASCULAR OUTCOMES WAS NOT POWER TO LOOK AT BRES CANCER IT WAS STOPPED BECAUSE OF BREAS CANER RISK BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CONTROL ARM O THE STUDY WAS THAT THEY HAD AN INCREDIBLY LOW RATE A BREAS CANCER AND SO AS A RESULT THEY NID UP HAVING THIS INCREASED RISK OF BRES CANCER AT FIVE YEARS AND THEY STOPP THE STUDY NOW THE STUDY WAS DONE WITH SYNTHETICS IT WAS DONE WITH CONJUGATED AGUINE ESTERGAN KNOWN AS PREMERAN AND MADROXY PROGESTERON ASTATE THIS WERE TH SO CALLED ESTERGAN AND PROGESTERON THOSE ARE A SYNTHETIC WORMONS WE THINK ESPECIALLY THE PROGESTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREAT ARISCOF BRES CANCER ALTHOUGH THE THE SUBSEQUENT REEVALUATIONS OF THE DATA NOW EIGHTEEN YEARS OUT HAVE SHOWN THAT A THIS PROBLEM WITH THE CONTROL GROUP AND NO INCREASE RISK A BREAS CANCER A AND FOR THE WOMEN WHO GOT ESTRGEN ONLY THOSE WHO HAD A HISTRACTME THE PREMERAN THEY ACTUALLY HAD A DECREASE BRES CANCER RISK AND DECREASED BRES CANTSOR MORTALITY SO THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT THIS SOME TRYING TO KEEP IT REALLY BRIEF BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE WOMEN FIFTY TO SIXTY SO WITHIN TEN YEARS OF MENAPAS THEYEARE THE ONE WHO SEEM TO HAVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT SO THEY HAD A DECREASED SUBCLENICAL ATHERISCULOROSA SO LESS CARDY VASCULA DISEASE THEY HAD AN IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF A BONE HEALTH A LESS PROGRESSION TO DIABEDES AND THEN OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY THEY STARTED HAVE GREATER RISK OF CERTAIN OUTCOMES SUCH AS CRDIVASCROSES MY GARDIAL IN FIRTION AND SO ON YOU ASKED ABOUT A WHAT DO I DO ND TO ME THIS PROBLEM IS NOT JUST MENAPAS WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING IS TO TALK ABOUT PERI MENAPAS SO PERI MANAPAS IS THE THE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE YOUR FINAL MINSTREL CYCLE AN FOR MOST WOMEN DEPENDING ON HOW IT TUNES YOU ARE TO THE SYMPTOMS IT CAN LAST FOR TEN YEARS SO IAM STILL IN PERI MAPAS ID SPEN LIKE TWENTY YEARS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRACKING IT SO CAREFULLY IT USUALLY GETS KICKED OFF BY HAVING YOURCYCL GET CLOSER TOGETHER SO THAT CAN HAPPEN YOUR THIRTIES OR YOUR FORTES YOU GO FROM TWENTY DAYS TO TWENTY FIVE DAYS THAT SORT OF THING YOU MAY NOTICE THAT STARTS SLEEPING MORE POORLY BECAUSE PRODESTRON SO IMPORTANT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH KYL YOU MAY NOTICE IT AS MORE ANXIETY DIFFICULTIS SLEEPING AND THAT PROBABLY IS RELATED TO THE ESTRTAN RECEPTOR SO EAR ALPA IS A ESTRSHAN RECEPTOR ALPA IS ANXIO A IT INCREASES ANXIETY EAR BEDA IS SISIE WITH AN INXIOLITIC ACTIVITY AND THEN THERE'S A TOTAL ABOUTS SIX CESTERSON RECEPTORS NOW THERE'S THE THE G PEROTIN COUPLED ESTRIAN RECEPTORS AND THOS ARE MIXED ANXIOLITIC INXIAGENIC SO A THERE'S THIS WHOLE PERIOD OF PERYI MENPSAN WHAT'S MOST FASCINATING TO ME AND WE'VE GOT A TALK ABOUT THIS EITHER TODAY OR ANOTHER TINE IS THAT THERE IS THIS MASSIVE MASSIVE CHANGES THAT HAPPENS IN THE FEMALE BRAINE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ENOUGH AND SO LOOKING AT THE WORK OF LESAMASCONY AT CORNELL FROM A STARTING AROUND ACH FORTY THERE IS THIS MASSIV CHANGE IN CEREBRAL METAPOLISM SOE CAN DO FT G PETSKANS YOU CAN LOOK AT GLUCOSUP TAKE AND THERE'S ABOUT ON AVERAGE A TWENTY PERCENT DECLINE FROM PREMENAPAS YOU KNOW UP TO LIKE AGE THIRTY FIVE TO PERRI MENAPAS TO POSTMENAPAS THE WOMEN FOR HAVING THE MOST SYMPTOMS IN PERY MENAPAS MENAPASA HA PLASH THE NIGHTS WATS THE DIFFICULTIES SLEEPING THOSE OF THE ONES WHO HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CEREBRAL HYPO METABOLISM TIS ALMOST LIKE I A I DON'T I DONT WANT A SCARE PEOPLE WITH THIS LANGUAGE BUT IS ISA LOW LEVEL OR LET'S CALL IT SUDO DEMENSHO OF SORTS YES IT IT SEEMS TO BE A FENA TYPE THAT YOU CAN THEN MAP TO ALL SIMERS TISES BECAUSE THAT'S LESAMOSCONY'S WORK SHE'S SLIPPING AT O KA ALL SIMER'S DISEASE IS NOT AT DISEASE OF OLD AGE IT IS DISEASE OF MIDDLE AGE WHAT ARSOME THE PIOMARKERS THAT WE CAN DEFINE THAT CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOR RISK IS I'VE GOT A MOTHER AND A GRANDMOTHER WITH ALLSIMERS DISEASE YOU CAN BELIEVE I AM ALL OVER THIS DATA AN INSOLENT RESISTANCE UD MTENCITIVITY AS WE TOUGH ABEFORE A SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THERE IT WHICH I THINK IT WHEN THAT FIRST WHEN THAT I DA FOR SURFACE AF YOU PEOPLE LIKE REALLY BUT THEN OF COURSE RITDOM IN THE BRAIN IS THIS INCREDIBLY MEN OF ALKLY DEMANDING MORGAN YOU DEPRIVE NEIRONS OF FUEL SOURCES THEY FOR YOU MAKE THEM LESS SENSITIVE TO FUEL SOURCES THEY STARE DYING THAT IS ERNLY START FIRING LESS IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND I THINK NOW IT'S THINKS DELEASEAS WORK WORK THAT YOU'VE T YOU'VE DONE IN I TALKED ABOUT QUITE A LOT IS AM YOUR BOOKS AND ELSEWHERE I THINK ITS REALLY YOU KNOW HI LIGHTED FOR PEOPLE THAT METABYLISM A METABYLOMACS I'S GOING T BE AS IMPORTANT IS GENES IN GENOMACS WHEN IT COME THATIS RIGHT DEMENSHA PERHAPS ESPECIALLY IN WOMEN IS IT SAFE TO SAY THAT I THINK I THINK SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE SYSTEM IS REGULATED BY ESTERTON SO THE DECLINE IN ESTERTAN STARTING AROUND AH FORTY FORTY THREE IS CONE ONTO AVERAGE SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVER BEHIND CEREPRAL HYPO METOPOLISM THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT TO MY PATIENCE IS IT'S LIKE SLOW BRAIN ENERGY SO YOU WALK INTO A ROOM YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHY LIKE YOU JUST NOTICE THAT YOU CAN'T MANAGE ALL THE TASSOWAT WHTYOU ONCE COULD LIKE THINGS ARE JUST A LITTLE SLOWER AND I SAY THAT TO WOMEN ARE LIKE I HAVE THAT I HELP ME SO THIS IS THEN CIRCLING BACK TO DEVUAH I WHERE WOMEN ARE SCARED TO DEATH OF TAKING HORMONT THERABE AND WE'VE GOT ALL OF THESE WOMEN THAT ARE MARCHING TOWARD POTENTIALLY A GREATER RISK OF ALL SIMERS DISEASE AND THEY HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY IN THEIR FORTIES AND THEIR FIFTIES TO TAKE HORMONT THERAPE AND THEY MAY NOT BE OFFERED IT BECAUSE THE TYPICAL CONVENTIONAL APPROACH BASDON TO BEUAH IS TO SAY UNLESS YOU'RE HAVING HOTFLASHES AND NIGHTS WETS THAT AUR SEVERE I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU HORMONT THERABE AND I I JUST WANT O CALL THAT OUT I WOULD SAY NO THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO APPROACH IT FURTHER THE CONCEPT RIGHT NOW IN CONVENTIONAL MEDICIN IS THAT HOTFLASHES AND NIGHTS WEATS ARE THESE NEW SINT SYMPTOMS THAT WE WILL TAKE CARE OF TEMPORARILY MAYBE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ESTERTAN PROTESTERON OR BIRTH CONTROLPL DOESE IT'S GIVEN A LOT OR THER THEY PASS ERE THIS IYOS IDEAL AN AS SUCK IT UP SUCK IT UP DOES A MATTER THAT SHOU'RE NOT SLEEPING ANY MORE YOU KNOW TURN DOWN THE TEMPERATURE IN  GROOM AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT BECAUSE HOFLESH IS A NIGHT SWEATS ARE A BILEMARKER OF CARTYG METABOLIC DISEASE THEY ARE A BILEMARKER OF INCREASE BONMOSS THEY ARE A BILEMARKER OF CHANGES IN THE BRAIN SO MANY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR IN PERRY MENAPAS ARE NOT DRIVEN BY THE OVERIES THEY ARE DRIVEN BY THE BRAIN IT'S THE THE BYDIRECTIONAL CROSS TALK BETWEEN THE BODY IN THE BRAIN KEEPS ENO I THINK IS THIS RESOUNDING THEME  WE CHRISPALMER ON HERE SYGATRIS IS TIME A KEETOGENICDI TOTING UNTIL HEALTH I KNOW IYOU WE CAN HAVE A WHOLE OTHER DISCUSSION OF MAN WE WILL I HOPE IF YOU'L AGREE TO IT ABOUT NUTRITIAN AN AS RELEAS TO HORMONS O SPECIFIC DIETSON AND SO FORTH BUT THE AND THAT'S A QUESTION TO WHETHER THIS PROBLEM OF CEREBRALHYPOMETOPOLISM COULD WE SOLVE IT WITH ESTRATON ANDOR INCREASE METABOLIC FLEXIBILITY SO I JUST WANTED E MET THA E SIGT INTERICT YOU KNONT PLEASE A PLEASE INTERRUPT EM I I KNOW OURO ASALNS WERE THERE I KNOW YOU ARE A FAN IN SOME INSTANCES OF INTERMITTIN FASTING TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING ANDOR QEITOGENIC DIET YES UM TO GET SELLS SENSITIVE TO INSOLENT WHICH IS NOT TO SAY IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT WOMEN ME TO STAY ON THE KETOGENIC DIET FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WERE INTERMITTIN FAST RY ONLY TIME RESTRICTED FEETING FOR EIGHT HOURS OR SIX HOURS A DAY BUT THAT BY INCREASING YOU SAID METABOLIC FLEXIBLE BILITY SCUSE ME BUT BY INCREASING SELLS SENSITIVITYET INSOLEN AND THEN MAY BE RETURNING TO A MORE TYPICAL EATING PATTERN MPERIODICALLY SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH THAT MIGHT ACSHU BENEFICI BE BENEFICIAL TO I HAVE THAT RIGHT YET I LOVE THE PULSE SO I FEEL LI CUTS MUCH MORE PHYSIOLOGIC THAN SAY GOING ON A KEITOGENIC DIET AND STAYING THERE FOR YEARS ALL OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE ON THE KEITOGENI DIET IT'S PRETTY LIMITED IN TERMIS TURATION OU KNOW THE THE LONGEST PLAYERS THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF THE DATA ARE THE FOLKS WITH APOLUPSY AND THAT'S JUST A DIFERENT PHENITYPE SO I THINK IN TERMS OF MYCROBIOMAFACTS DIFERSITY TOSPAYOSIS MOFTHOS ISSUES WE REALLY DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF LONG TERMAFACTS SO I PREFER WITH A KITOGENIC DIET THAT IT'S USE AS AN END OF ONE EXPERIMENT AND THAT YOU DO IT FOR FOUR WEEKS MAYBE MEASURE BY AMARKERS BEFORE AND AFTEWARDS MAYBE LICATURE STOOL BEFORE AND AFTERWARDS WE STOLL AN TOCKD ABOUT STOOL TUST YET BUT YOU COULD MEASURE YOUR FASTING INSOLEN AND YOUR GLUCOSE YOU COU JUST START TERE DO FOUR WEEKS OF QUEITO CLEAN KQEITO INCLUDING VEGETABLES DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FIFTY SEVEN TO DAY AND THEN MEASURED AGAIN AFTERWARDS SINCE YOU MEASURE A MENTION STOOL TESTING YES UM WHAT WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION ABOUT STOOL TESTING SO MY RECOMMENDATION THISIS AGAIN IN THE THE FIELD OF IF YOU HAVE THE DISPOSABLE AND COMES SO I USUALLY START WITH NOVA BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A GOOD COPE SYSTEM WITH INSURANCE THAT'S WHAT I TYPICALLY USE SO I USUALLY DO THERE ONE DAY  STOOL TAS WE HAVE TO GO DICKING THROUGH YOUR STOOL AND SEND IT OFF TO THE SLAB THAT'S IN NORTH CAROLINA I USUALLY DO THE ONE DAY UNLESS SOME CONCERNED ABOUT PARASITES IN THAT CASE I TEND TO DO THREE DAYS I DO THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL A FAIR AMOUNT AND GO TO PLACES WHERE THERE'S GREAT A RISK OR THEY JUST HAVE GOT SYMPTOMS ANOTHER TEST THAT I DO A LOT IS UM CAS I WAS LIKE TO MENTION TO LABS IS AT TEST BY ONE JEVITY AND THIS IS MUCH MORE OF AT DATALONK ATYPE OF TASK AS POWERED BY A I WAS DESIGNED BY UM AGY WHOS C OT INFLAMETORY BOLDISESE AND HE IS A UM HE'S A PEEGETY DEEP PHENISIPEING BI IN FRORMATIC SKY WHO WANTED TO MAKE THIS REALLY EASY SO THE TEST IS IS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THORN AND U THES CALL IC UP BY O THEY MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER NAME FOR IT AND THEY JUST IMPROVED IT O THAT IS IS A WIPE AND SO TAKING THREH HER STOOL AND SO MY ATHLETES I'LL DO IT NOW THEY WERE NOT SO INTO TAKING THROUGH THEIR STOLL BEFORE IS ANYBODY THREALLY NOIN I DON'T WANT THE ANSWER R I KNOW THE ANSWER I REFER THAT AN THAT'S A SUPER INTERESTING TUS BECAUSE IT'S YOU GET MUCH MORE DENSE TATE A THE ISUE IS AM WITH APOLOGIES TO MY FRIENDS AT THORN THIS SUE IS THAT THEYRE RECOMMENDATIONS AND A PEING THORN SUPPLEMENTS SO THAT CAN BE VERY EASY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO IN A CONNECT THE DOTS THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE WAY THAT I LIKE TO DO IT A FIRST OF ALL THREE THINGS UM YOU'VE SHARED WITH US AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE A AND IN THAT FIRST STATEMENT I ALSO WANT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I THREW IT YOU THE ENTIRE LIFE SPAN OF A FEMALE LIFE SPAN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CONTRACEPTION DI IT A MICROBIUM SO MANY THINGS BUT A I FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU TAUGHT ME A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT UM INCLUDING I THINK SOMETHING THAT IT MOST PEOPLE IN CLEAG MYSELF HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT ENOUGH WHICH IS THE PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPACT ON THINGS THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH CONSTIPATION BAULL MOVEMENTS WHAT WE EAT WHAT WE AVOID HAVE TO SAY REALLY A HUGE THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE 'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ON THIS POD CAST BEFORE SO OF KNOW THAT BRAIN COMUNICATES WITH BODY PSYCHOLOGY NG BIOLOGY OR LINKED BUT I THINK THIT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT ANY ONE'S EVER DIRECTLY LINKED CIRCUMSTANCES AND BIOLOGY AN PSYCHOLOGY IN SUCH A CONCRETE WAY SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST THING I MUT SPEAK FOR MANY PEOPLE IN THAT SECOND OF ALL WE BARELY SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND AM WHICH IS BOTH A FRUSTRATING FOR ME BECAUSE A IT I ALWAYS WANT TO LEARN MORE ANDI KNOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE DO AS WELL BUT ALSO VERY VERY EXCITING BECAUSE A WITH A HOPEULLY WITHOUT MUCH PERSUASION WE CAN HAVE YOU BACK ON TO TALK ABOUT THERESN'T AT ALL LIKE MANA I KNOW YOUR WORKING WITH MEN NOW MENS HEALTH A SOME PARTICULARS AROUND PAR I THINK IT THERE'S MORE FOR US TO EXPLORE IN TERMS OF PIECAS MENOPAS CONTRACEPTION AND AND ALL OF THE ABOVE BUT THEN SOMETHING THAT YOU AND I WERE TALKING BOUT OFF CAMERA UM BEFORE WE STARTED WHICH I THINK IS AREALLY IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT TIES BACK TO THIS ASSUE OF A TRAMA AND STRESS AND THE BY DIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEN BIOLOGY AN PSYCHOLOGY HOPEULY SOME DAY WE WON'T EVEN SEPARATE THOSE TOO AHAHUM W CH IS THE USE OF SPECIFIC MEDICINES INCLUDING PLANT MEDICINES YES AND HOW THAT CAN INFLUENCE OVER ALL HEALTH WHICH NO DOUBT WILL INCLUDE WORM ON HEALTH SO I SAY ALL OF THAT O FOR TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL TO CUE UP THE WE WON'T HIM CALL IT A PART TO BUT A SEQUEL TOHE TO THIS WAS A  GRATIFIED TO HEAR THAT YOU YOU'LL JOIN US FOR THAT AND THEN ALSO DID JUST REALLY EXTEND A HUGE THANK YOU THE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SHARED IS IS IMMENSE AND OT IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY USEFUL AN ACTIONABLE FOR FOR MEN IN TERMS OF THEIR THINKING IN THEIR ACTIONS AND FOR WOMEN IN PARTICULAR TO DAY'S DISCUSSION AND PRO GHER FOR WOMEN IN TERMS OF HOW TO THINK ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND BIOLOGY HOW TO THINK ABOUT THEIR PSYCHOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ALL THAT'S INVENTED AND I JUST WANT TO SAY AN ENORMOUS THANK YOU THINK YOU ANDREW I SO APPRECIATE THAT AN I SO APPRECIATE WHIT YOU OFFER TO THE WORLD AN TERMS O AWAY AN AWAY TO UNDERSTAND PHYSIOLOGY AND HOW TO CRAFT A ARCHITECT A BETTER LIFE A CAN I US ADD ONE LAST THING AS I SIN TAGOATITSSO WE DIDNT GET O THE FORTIESIN THE FIFTIES ON THIS LIS O BY A MARKERARYS TO SO I FEEL LIKE IF PEOPLE IF WOMEN WENT AWAY WITH ONE THING TO DAY IT WOULD BE TO DO A CORNERY ARDERY CALCIUM SCORE BY AGE FORTY FIVE AND SOONER IF YOU'VE GOT PREMATURE AR TO SEES HOW IS THAT TAKEN SO IT'S A C TSKAN OF THE CHEST YOU CAN SELF ORDER IT LIKE I THINK IT' STAMPORD HOSPITAL YOU CAN SELF ORDER AT LAST TIME A PATIENT CHACK TO IS TO UNER VITEOLARS O AGAIN DISPOSE WILL INCOME BUT IT IT TELLS YOU IT IT ALMOST GIVES YOU THIS FORK IN THE ROAD IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO CARDY METABOLIC HEALTH AS A WOMEN AND IT'S A FORTY FIVE FOR MEN TO SO IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD ONE HAVE OU HAD ONE NO YOU NEED ONE IN IS ON CARTICS ALL C S GREAT SO I'LL RUN ALL THAT BY YOU IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL AND IT'S SOME YA IT'S IT'S SO FASCINATING BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME WOMEN WHO HAVE A ZERO SMY SCORE ZERO AND THAT'S GREAT SO OFTEN YOU CAN JUST KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING BT IF YOU'RE FORTY FIVE IN YOUR STARTING TO BE ELEVATED OR YOU'VE GOT NO MAYBE'VE GOT PIECEO ASSER YOU'VE GOT SOME OTHER BY O MARKERS TENDING YOU IN THIS STIRACTION TOWARD THE NUMBER ONE KILLER REALLY IT'S NINE OUT OF THE TOP TEN KILLERS AN NOU ES GOT ALLOWS YOU TO REALLY START TO MAKE CHANGES AND I I THINK IT'S

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONTCAS  SCIENCE SCIENCE FACE TO S FOR I MANDER HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS POD CAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRIN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCINCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN AL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETI GREENS ONCE OR TWICE O DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOT MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEYL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATAND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEND THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBER THIS MONTH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE SENSES HOW WE DETECT THINGS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THE LAST EPISODE WAS ALL ABOUT VISION HOW WE TAKE LIGHT AND CONVERT THAT INFORMATION INTO THINGS THAT WE CAN PERCEIVE LIKE COLLORS AND FACES AND MOTION THINGS OF THAT SORT AS WELL AS HOW WE USE LIGHT TO CHANGE OUR BIOLOGY AN WAYS THAT ARE SUBCONSCIOUS THAT WE DON'T REALIZE THINGS LIKE MOOD AND METABOLISM AND LEVELS OF ALERTNESS TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CHEMICAL SENSING WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SENSE OF SMELL OUR ABILITY TO DETECT ODORS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT WEAREALSO GONGTO TALK ABOUT TASTE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT CHEMICALS AND MAKE SENSE OF CHEMICALS THAT ARE PUT IN OUR MOUTH AND INTO OUR DIGESTIVE TRACT AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CHEMICALS THAT ARE MADE BY OTHER HUMAN BEINGS THAT POWERFULLY MODULATE THE WAY THAT WE FEEL OUR HORMONES IN OUR HEALTH NOW THAT LAST CATEGORY ARE SOMETIMES CALLED PHERIMONES HOWEVER WHETHER NOT PHAREMONES EXIST IN HUMANS IS RATHER CONTROVERSIAL THERE ACTUALLY HASN'T BEEN A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF A TRUE HUMAN PEREMONAL EFFECT BUT WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WHAT IS UNDENIABLE IS THAT THERE AR CHEMICALS THAT HUMAN BEINGS MAKE AND RELEASE IN THINGS LIKE TEARS ON TO OUR SKIN AND SWEAT AND EVEN BREATH THAT POWERFULLY MODULATE OR CONTROL THE BIOLOGY OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN FACT RIGHT NOW EVEN IF YOU'RE COMPLETELY ALONE YOUR CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT INTERNALLY IS BEING CONTROLLED BY EXTERNAL CHEMICALS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND YOUR HORMONES AND YOUR METABOLISM OR BEING MODIFIED BY THINGS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT SO OR CAN A TALK ABOUT THOSE IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING ASPECT TO OUR BIOLOGY IT'S ONE OF OUR MOSE PRIMORDIAL MEANING PRIMITIVE ASPECTS OF OUR BIOLOGY BUT IT STILL VERY ACTIVE IN ALL OF US TO DAY THIS EPISODE BELIEVE IT ARE NOT WILL HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS A LOT OF PROTOCOLS EVEN THOUGH I'M GUESSING MOST OF YOU CAN PROBABLY SMELL YOUR ENVIRONMENT JUST FINE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE TO EAT AND WHAT TASTE GOOD AND WHAT DOESN'T TASTE GOOD TO YOU TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS THAT WILL LOW YOU TO ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THESE CHEMICAL SENSING MECHANISMS INCLUDING HOW YOU SMELL NOT BUT HOW YOU SMELL IN THE QUALITATIVE SENSE BEHOW YOU SMELL IN THE VERB SENSE THE ACTION OF SNIFFING AND SMELLING TO ENHANCE YOUR SENSE OF SMELL AND TO ENHANCE YOUR SENSE OF TASTE AS WELL BELIEVEIT ORE NOT TO ENHANCE YOUR COGNITION YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN AND REMEMBER THINGS EVERYTHING WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT AS ALWAYS IS GROUNDED IN QUALITY PUE REVIEWED STUDIES FROM SOME EXCELLENT LABORATORIES I'LL PROVIDE SOME RESOURCES ALONG THE WAY SO THAT MEANS TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS AND ALSO BASIC INFORMATION YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN A TON OF NERRAL SCIENCE AND A LOT OF BIOLOGY IN GENERAL AND I THINK WHAT YOU'LL COME TO REALIZE BY THE END IS THAT WHILE WE ARE CLEARLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ANI MALS THERE AR ARE ASPECTS TO OUR BIOLOGY THAT IARE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF OTHER ANIMALS IN VERY INTERESTING WAYS BEFORE WE DIVE INTO CHEMICAL SENSING I WANTED JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS FROM THE VISION EPISODE ONE IS A SUMMARY OF A PROTOCOL SO I COVERED THIRTEEN PROTOCOLS LAST EPISODE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT EPISODE CHECK IT OUT THOSE PROTOCALS WILL ALLOW YOU TO BE MORE ALERT AND TO SEE BETTER OVER TIME IF YOU FOLLOW THEM ALL OF THE MER ZERO COST YOU CAN FIND ANY IN ALL OF THEM AT HUBERMAN LAB DOC COM THERE'S A LINK TO THOSE VIDIOS AND TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS EVERYTHNG IS TIME STAMPED THE TWO PROTOCOLS THAT I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY OF AR THE PROTOCOL OF NEAR FAR VIEWING THAT ALL OF US REGARDLESS OF AGE SHOULD PROBABLY SPEND ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THREE TIMES A WEEK DOING SOME NEAR FAR VIEWING EXERCISES SO THAT WOULD BE BRINGING A PEN OR PENCIL UP CLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE ABOUT TO CROSS YOUR EYES BUT YOU DON'T CROSS YOUR EYES AND THEN OUT AT SOME DISTANCE AND THEN LOOK BE ON THAT PEN OR OTHER A OBJECT THAT YOU'RE USING OFF AS FAR AS YOU CAN INTO THE DISTANCE WOU BE GREAT IF YOU COULD DO THIS ON A BALCONY OR DACK AND THEN LOOK WAY OFF IN THE DISTANCE AND THEN BRING IT BACK IN THIS IS GOING TO EXERCISE THAT ACCOMMODATION REFLECTS THE CHANGE IN THE SHAPE OF THE LENS CAN HELP OFFSET A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING MYOPIA NEAR SIGHTEDNESS THE OTHER ONE IS THIS INCREDIBLE STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT TWO HOURS A DAY OUTSIDE EVEN IF YOU'RE DOING OTHER THINGS WHILE YOU ARE OUTSIDE CAN HELP OFFSET MYOPIA AND NEAR SIGHTEDNESS SO TRYING GET OUTSIDE IT'S REALLY THE SUNLIGHT AND THE BLUE LIGHT RIGHT  RUINS BEEN DEMONIZING BLUE LIGHT OUT THERE BUT BLIGHT IS GREAT PROVIDED IT'S NOT SUPERSUPERBRIGHT A AND REALLY CLOSE TO YOUR EYES BLULIGHT IS TERRIFIC IF IT COMES FROM SUNLIGHT TWO HOURS A DAY OUTSIDE IS GOING TO HELP OFFSET MYOPIA NEAR SIGHTEDNESS THAT'S A LOT OF TIME I THINK MOST OF US ARE NOT GETTING THAT TIME BUT SINCE YOU CAN DO OTHER THINGS LIKE GARDENING OR READING OR WALKING OR RUNNING IF YOU CAN GET THAT TWO HOURS OUTSIDE YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND YOUR BRAIN WILL BENEFIT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE BRIEF CORRECTION TO SOMETHING THAT I SAID INCORRECTLY IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE AT THE END OF THE EPISODE I TALKED ABOUT LUTINE AND HOW LOUTINE MAY HELP OFFSET SOME MODERATE TO SEVERE AGE RELATED MACULA DEGENERATION AS WELL I TALKED ABOUT HOW SOME PEOPLE ARE SUPPLEMENTING WITH LUTINE EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE AGE RELA MACULAR DEGENERATION WITH THE IDEA MIND THAT IT MIGHT HELP OFFSET SOME VISION LOSS AS THEY GET OLDER I SAID LTINE AND LUTINE WAS THE CORRECT THING TO SAY BUT ONCE OR TWICE WHEN I STARTED SPEAKING FAST I SAID LOUCINE AND NOT LOUTINE I WANT TO EMPHISIZE THAT LUCINE AND A MENOACID VERY INTERESTING IN PORTANT FOR MUSCLE BUILDING COVERED AN PREVIOUS EPISODES BUT LOUTINE EL UT E I N IS THE MOLECULING COMPOUND THAT I WAS REFERRING TO IN TER S OF SUPPLEMENTING FORSAKE OF VISION SO I APOLOGIZE PLEASE FORGIVE ME I MISS SPOKE COUPLE OF YOU CAUGHT THAT RIGHT AWAY A ENLISTING THE EPISODE AFTER IT WENT UP BY REALIZED THAT I'D MISSPOKEN SO LUTINE FOR VISION LUCINE FOR MUSCLES AND MUSCLE GROWTH AND STRENGTH ET CETERA BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THE CONTENTS OF TO DAY'S EPISODE I WANTED JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON COLOR VISION MANY OF YOU ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT COLOR VISION AND COLOR PERCEPTION AND INDEED COLOR PERCEPTION IS A FASCINATING ASPECT OF THE HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES US UNIQUE THERE CERTAINLY OTHER ANIMALS OUT THERE THAT CAN DETECT ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW SOME CAN EVEN DETECT INTO THE INPERED AND TO THE FAR RED A THAT WE CHAN'T SEE BUT NONE THE LESS HUMAN COLOR VISION PROVIDED THAT SOMEBODY ISN'T COLOR BLIND IS A REALLY REMARKABLE AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN COLOR VISION OR YOU WANT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ART OR ABOUT FOR INSTANCE WHY THAT DRESS THAT SHOWED UP ON LINE A FEW YEARS AGO LOOKS BLUE TO YOU AND YELLOW TO SOMEBODY ELSE ALL THE ANSWERS TO THAT AR IN THIS TERRIFIC BOOK WHICH IS WHAT IS COLOR FIFTEEN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE SCIENCE OF COLOR I DID NOT WRITE THIS BOOK I WISH I HAD THE BOOK IS BY AEREEL AND JON EXTUT THAT E C K S T U T SO IT'S WHAT IS COLOR FIFTY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE SCIENCE OF COLOR IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS BOOK I'VE NO BUSINESS RELASIONSHIP TO THEM I DID HELP THEM GET IN CONTACT WITH SOME COLOR VISION SCIENTISTS WHEN THEY REACHED OUT TO ME AND YOU CAN KNOW THAT ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE BOOK WAS VETTED BY EXCELLENT COLOR VISION SCIENTISTS IT'S A REALLY WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL BOOK THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE BEAUTIFUL IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO'S INTERESTED IN DESIGN ERE ART OR YOU'RE JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF COLOR IT'S A TERIFIC BOOK I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT YOU JUST LOOK UP IT UP ON LINE THEIR VARIETY OF PLACES OF THAT WILL AW YOU TO ACCESS THE BOOK SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SENSING CHEMICALS AND HOW CHEMICALS CONTROL US IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PHYSICAL STIMULE THERE IS LIGHT PHOTONS WHICH ARE LIGHT ENERGY AND THOSE LAND ON YOUR RETINAS AND YOURETINAS TELL YOUR BRAIN ABOUT THEM AND YOUR BRAIN CREATES THIS THING WE CALL VISION THERE ARE SOUND WAVES LITERALLY PARTICALS MOVING THROUGH THE AIR AND REVERBERATIONS THAT CREATE WHAT WE CALL SOUND AND HEARING AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MECHANICAL STIMULE PRESSURE LIGHT TOUCH SCRATCH TICKLE ET CETERA THAT LANDS ON OUR SKIN OR THE BLOWING OF A BREEZE OF THAT DEFLECTS THE HAIRS ON OUR SKIN AND WE CAN SENSE MECHANICAL TOUCH MECHANICAL SENSATION AND THERE ARE CHEMICALS THERE THINGS FLOATING AROUND IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHAT WHICH WE CALL VOLATILE CHEMICALS SOVOLATILE SOUNDS OFTENTIMES LIKE E MOTIONALLY VOLATILE BUT JUST MEANS THAT THEI'RE FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE SO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SMELL SOMETHING LIKE LHET SAY YOU SMEL LL A WONDERFULLY SMELLING ROSE OR CAKE YES YOU ARE INHALING THE PARTICLS INTO YOUR NOSE THEIR LITERLLY LITTLE PARTICLS OF THOSE CHEMICALS ARE GOING UP INTO YOUR NOSE AND BEING DETECTED BY YOUR BRAIN ALSO IF YOU SMELL SOMETHING PUTRID DISCUSTING OR AWFUL USE YOUR IMAGINATION THOSE PARTICALS ARE GOING UP INTO YOUR NOSE AND BEING DETECTED BY NURONS THAT ARE PART OF YOUR BRAIN OTHER WAYS OF GETTING CHEMICALS INTO UR SYSTEM IS BY PUTTING THEM IN OUR MOUTH BY LITERALLY TAKING FOODS AND CHEWING THEM OR SUCKING ON THEM AND BREAKING THEM DOWN INTO THEIR COMPONENT PARTS AND THAT'S ONE WAY THAT WE SENSE CHEMICALS WITH ATHING AR TONGUE AND THERE ARE CHEMICALS THAT CAN ENTER THROUGH OTHER MUCOSIL LININGS AND OTHER KIND OF JUST THINK DAMP STICKY LININGS OF YOUR BODY AND THE MAIN ONES WOULD BE THE EYES SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR NOSE YOUR EYES AND YOUR MOUTH BUT MAINLY WHEN WE HAVE CHEMICALS COMING INTO OUR SYSTEM IS THROUGH OUR NOSE OR THROUGH OUR MOUTH ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THROUGH OUR SKIN CERTAIN THINGS CAN GO TRANSFERMAL NOT MANY AND THROUGH OUR EYES SO THESE CHEMICALS WE SOMETIMES BRING INTO OUR BODY INTO OUR BIOLOGY THROUGH DELIBERATE ACTION WE SELECT TO FOOD WE CHOEW THAT FOOD AND WE DO IT INTENTIONALLY SOMETIMES THEYRE COMING INTO OUR BODY THROUGH NON DELIBERATE ACTION WE ENTER AN ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR SMOKE AND WE SMELL THE SMOKE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE TAKE ACTION SOMETIMES WE ARE FORCED TO EAT SOMETHING BECAUSE SOMEBODY TELLS US WE SHOULD EAT IT OR WE DO IT TO BE POLITE SO THERE ALL THESE WAYS THAT CHEMICALS CAN MAKE INTOH OUR BODY SOMETIMES HOWEVER OTHER PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY MAKING CHEMICALS WITH THEIR BODY TYPICALLY THIS WOULD BE WITH THEIR BREATH WITH THEIR TEARS OR POSSIBLY I ONT UNDERSCORE POSSIBLY BY MAKING WHAT ARE CALLED FARMONES MOLECULES THAT THEY RELEAS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT TYPICALLY THROUGH THE BREATH THAT ENTER OUR SYSTEM THROUGH OUR NOSE OUR EYES OR OUR MOUTH THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE OUR BIOLOGY I WILL EXPLAIN HOW SMELL AND TASTE AND THESE FAREMONE EFFECTS WORK BUT ALL JUST GIVEN EXAMPL WHICH IS A VERY SALIENT AND INTERESTING ONE THAT WAS PUBLISHED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE SCIENCE MAGAZINE IS ONE OF THE THREE WHAT WE CALL APEX JOURNALS THERE ARE LOT OF JOURNALS OUT THERE BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT TO KNOW SCIENCE MAGAZINE NATURE MAGAZINE AND CELL ARE CONSIDERED THE THREEE TOP CAND OF APEX JOURNALS THEY ARE THE MOST STRINGENT INTERMS OF GETTING PAPERS ACCEPTED THERE EVEN REVIEWED THERE THEY THEY HAVE ABOUT A NINETY FIVE PER CENT REJECTION RATE AT THE FRONT GAIT MEANING THEY ONT EVEN REVIEW NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF WHAT GET SENT TO THEM OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO DECIDE TO REVIEW AND GET SENT OUT A VERY SMALL PER CENTAGE OF THOSE GET PUBLISHED VERY STRINGENT THIS PAPER CAME OUT IN SCIENCE SHOWING THAT HUMANS MEN IN PARTICULAR IN THIS STUDY HAVE A STRONG BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND HORMONAL RESPONSE TO THE TEARS OF WOMEN WHAT THEY DID IS THEY HAD WOMEN AND IN THIS CASE IT WAS ONLY WOMEN FOR WHATEVER REASON CRY AND THEY COLLECTED THEIR TARS THEN THOSE TEARS WERE SMELED BY MALE SUBJECTS OR MALE SUBJECTS GOT WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY THE CONTROL WHICH WAS THE SALING MEN THAT SMELLED THESE TEARS THAT WERE EVOKED BY SADNESS HAD A REDUCTION IN THEIR TESTOSTRONE LEVELS THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT THEY ALSO HAD A REDUCTION IN BRAIN AREAS THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SECUAL AROUSAL NOW BEFORE YOU RUN OFF WITH YOUR INTERPRETATIONS ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS AND CRITICIZED THE STUDY FOR ANY VARIETY OF REASONS US JUST TAKE A STEP BACK I WILL CRITICIZE THE STUDY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS TO ONE IS THAT THEY ONLY USED FEMALE TEARS AND MALE SUBJECTS SO IT WOUDHAVE BEEN NICE FOR THEM TO ALSO USE FEMALE TEARS AND FEMALE SUBJECTS SMELLING THOSE MALE TEARS AND MALE SUBJECT SMELLING THOSE MALE TEARS AND FEMALE SUBJECT SMELLING THOSE AND SO ON THEY DIDN'T DO THAT THEY DID HAVE LARGE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS SO THAT'S GOOD THAT ADDS POWER TO THE STUDY AND THEY DID HAVE TO COLLECT THESE TEARS BY HAVING THE WOMEN WATCH A WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY A SAD SCENE FROM A MOVIE THEY SHOUL RECRUITED SUBJECTS THAT HAD A HIGH PROPENSITY FOR CRYING AT SAD MOVIES WHICH WAS NOT ALL WOMEN IT TURNED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THEY RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY WERE PEOPL WHO SAID YES I TEND TO CRY WHEN I SEE SAD THINGS IN MOVIES WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO AS GUST JUST GET TEARS THAT WERE AUTHENTICALLY CRIED IN RESPONSE TO SADNESS AS OPPOSED TO O INO PUTTING SOME IRRITANT IN THE EYE AND COLLECTING TEARS THAT WERE EVOKED BY SOMETHING ELSE LIKE JUST HAVING THE EYES IRRITATED NONE THE LESS WHAT THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATES IS THAT THERE ARE CHEMICALS IN TEARS THAT ARE EVOKING OR CHANGING THE BIOLOGY OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS NOW MOST OF US DON'T THINK ABOUT SNIFFING OR SMELLING OTHER PEOPLE'S TEARS BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW IN CLOSE COUPLES OR IN FAMILY MEMBERS OR EVEN CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS ET CETERA THAT WE ARE OFTEN IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO OTHER PEOPLE'S TEARS NOW I DIDN'T SELECT THIS STUDY AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE I WANT A FOCUS ON THE EFFECTS OF TEARS ON HORMONS PER SAY ALTHOUGH I DO FIND THE RESULTS REALLY INTERESTING I CHOSE IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO JUST EMPHASIZE OR UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT CHEMICALS THAT ARE MADE BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS ARE POWERFULLY MODULATING OUR INTERNAL STATE AND THAT SOMETHING THAT MOST OF US DON'T APPRECIATE I THINK MOST OF US CAN APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IF WE SMELL SOMETHING PUTRED WE TEND TO RETRACT OR IF WE SMELL SOMETHING DELICIOUS WE TEND TO LEAN INTO IT BUT THERE ARE ALL THESE WAYS IN WHICH CHEMICALS ARE AFFECTING OUR BIOLOGY AND INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION USING CHEMICALS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR THAT OFTEN ABOUT BUT IT SUPERINTERESTING SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SMELL AND WHAT SMELL IS AND HOW IT WORKS I MAN TO MAKE THIS VERY BASIC BUT I AM GOING TO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE CORPS ELEMENTS OF THE NUR BIOLOGY SO HERE'S HOW SMELL WORKS SMELL STARTS WITH SNIFFING THAT MAY COME AS NO SURPRISE BUT NO VOLATILE CHEMICALS CAN ENTER OUR NOSE UNLESS WE INHALE THEM IF OUR NOSE IS E CLUDED OR IF WE'RE ACTIVELY EXHALING ITS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR SMELLS TO ENTER OUR NOSE WHICH IS WI PEOPLE COVER THEIR NOSE WHEN SOMETHING SMELLS BAD NOW THE WAY THAT THESE VOLATILE ODORS COME INTO THE NOSE IS INTERESTING THEN THE NOSE HAS A MUCOSO LINING MUCUS THAT IS DESIGN TO TRAP THINGS TO ACTUALLY BRING THINGS IN AND GET STUCK THERE AT THE BASE OF YOUR BRAIN SO A YOU COULD ACH LY IMAGINE THIS OR IF YOU WANTED YOU COULD YOU COULD TOUCH THE ROOFOR YOUR MOUTH FOR RIBA THE HEVAW ABOUT TWO SENTIMETERS IS YOUR OLE FACTORY BULBIAL FACTORY BELL WAS A COLLECTION OF NURONS AND THOSE NURONS ACTUALLY EXTEND OUT OF THE SKULL OUT OF YOUR SKULL INTO YOUR NOSE INTO THE MUCOSAL LINING SO WHAT THIS MEANS AND KIND OF A LITERAL SENSE IS THAT YOU HAVE NURONS THAT EXTEND THEIR LITTLE LIL DENDRITES AND ACTS ONLY LIKE THINGS ARE LITTLE PROCESSIES AS WE CALL THEM OUT INTO THE MUCUS AND THEY RESPOND TO DIFFERENT ODORANT COMPOUNDS NOW THE ULFACTORY NURONS ALSO SEND A BRANCH DEEPER INTO THE BRAIN AND THEY SPLIT OFF INTO THREE DIFFERENT PATHS SO ONE PATH IS FOR WHAT WE CALL INNATE ODOR RESPONSES SO YOU HAVE SOME HARD WIRED ASPECTS TO THE WAY THAT YOU SMELL THE WORLD THAT WE'RE THERE FROM THE DAY YOU ARE BORN AND THAT WILL BE THERE UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE THESE OR THE PATHWAYS AND THE NURONS THAT RESPOND TO THINGS LIKE SMOKE WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S A HIGHLY ADAPTIVE FUNCTION TO BEING ABLE TO DETECT BURNING THINGS BECAUSE BURNING THINGS GENERALLY MEANS LACK OF SAFETY OR IMPENDING THREAT OF SOME KIND IT CALLS FOR ACTION AND INDEED THESE NURONS PROJECT TO CENTRAL AREA THE BRAIN CALLED THE EMIGDOLA WHICH IS OFTEN DISCUSSED INTERMS OF FEAR BUT IT'S REALLY A FEAR AND THREAT DETECTION SO SOME COMPOUND SOME CHEMICALS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU SMELL THEM UNLESS YOUR TRAIN TO OVERCOME THEM BECAUSE YOU'R A FIRE FIGHTER YOU WILL NATURALLY HAVE A HEIGHTEN LEVEL OF ALERTNESS YOU WILL SENSE THREAT AND IF YOU'RE IN SLEEP EVEN IT WILL WAKE YOU UP E SO THAT'S A GOOD THINGS COME E AN EMERGENCY SYSTEM YOU ALSO HAVE NURONS IN YOUR NOSE THAT RESPOND TO ODORANTS OR COMMINATIONS OF ODORANTS THAT EVOKE A SE ENCE OF DESIRE AND WHAT WE CALL APPETITIVE BEHAVIORS APPROACH BEHAVIORS THAT MAKE YOU ANT TO MOVE TOWARD SOMETHING SO WHEN YOU SMELL A DELICIOUS COOKI OR SOME DISH THAT'S REALLY SAVORY THAT YOU REALLY LIKE OR A WONDERFUL ORANGE AND YOU SAY UMORY IT FEELS DELICIOUS OR IT SMELLS DELICIOUS THAT'S BECAUSE OF THESE INNATE PATHWAY THESE PATHWAYS THAT REQUIRE NO LEARNING WHATSOEVER NOW SOME OF THE PATHWAYS FROM THE NOSE THESE OL FACTORY NRONS INTO THE BRAIN ARE INVOLVED IN LEARNED ASSOCIATIONS WITH ODORS MANY PEOPLE HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER THE SMELL OF THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S HOME OR THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S HANDS EVEN OR THE SMELL OF PARTICULAR ITEMS BAKING OR ON THE STOVE IN A PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT TYPICALLY THESE MEMORIES TEND TO BE OF A KIND OF NURTURING SORT OF FEELING SAFE AND PROTECTED BUT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OR FACTION SMELL IS SO CLOSELY TIED TO MEMORY IS BECAUSE OL FACTION IS THE MOST ANCIENT SENSE THAT WE HAVE OR I SHOULD SAY CHEMICAL SENSING IS AMONG THE MOST PRIMITIVE AND ANCIENT SENSES THAT WE HAVE PROBABLY ALMOST CERTAINLY EVOLVED BEFORE VISION AND BEFOR HEARING BUT WHEN WE COME INTO THE WORLD BECAUSE WE'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT THE STATISTICS OF LIFE ABOUT YOU KNOW WHOSE FRIENDLY AND WHO'S NOT FRIENDLY AND WHEARE'S A FUN PLACE TO BE AND WHERES A BORING PLACE TO BE THAT ALL TAKES A LONG TIME TO LEARN BUT THE ULFACTORY SYSTEM SEEMS TO IMPRINT SEEMS TO LAY DOWN MEMORIES VERY EARLY AND TO CREATE THESE VERY POWERFUL ASSOCIATIONS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LONG ENOUGH AND HARD ENOUGH MANY OF YOU CAN PROBABLY REALIZE THAT THERE CERTAIN SMELLS THAT EVOKE A MEMORY OF A PARTICULAR PLACE OR PERSON OR CONTET AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE PATHWAYS OUT OF THE NOSE THAT ARE NOT FOR INNATE BEHAVIORS LIKE PRINGING OR REPULSION OR A GAGGING A OR FOR THAT APPETITIVE UN SENSATION BUT THAT JUST REMIND YOU OF A PLACE OR A THING OR A CONTEXT COULD BE FLOWERS IN SPRING COULD BE GRANDMOTHERS HOME AND COOKIES THIS IS A VERY COMMON OCCURRENCE AND IT'S A VERY COMMON OCCURRENCE BECAUSE THIS GENERALLY EXISTS IN ALL OF US SO WE HAVE PATHWAY FOR INNATE RESPONSES AND A PATHWAY FOR LEARNED RESPONSES AND THEN WE HAVE THIS OTHER PATHWAY AND IN HUMANS IT'S ELUMIC CONTROVERSIAL AS TO WHETHER NOT IT SITS TRULY SEPARATE FROM THE STANDARD OL FACTORY SYSTEM OR WHETHER NOT ITS OWN SYSTEM INBEDDED IN THEIR BUT THAT THEY CALL THE ACCESSORY OR FACTORY PATHWAY ACCESSORIAL FACTORY PATHWAY IS WHAT IN OTHER ANIMALS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRUE FAIRMON EFFECTS WE WILL TALK ABOUT TRUE FAIRMON EFFECTS BUT FOR EXAMPLE IN RODINS AND IN SOME PRIMATES INCLUDING MANDRELS FUVESE MANDRELAY OF THESE LIKE BK NOSES THINGS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THM AT THE ZU LOOK HM UP IF YOU HAVE AN SEEN THEM ALREADY M A ND D AR I L S MANRELS THERE ARE STRONG FAREMON EFFECTS SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE IF YOU TAKE A PREGNANT FEMALE RODINT OR MANDREL YOU TAKE AWAY THE FATHER THAT CREATED THOSE PHEUSIS OR PHEDUS AND YOU INTRODUCE THE SCENT OF THE URINE OR THE FUR OF A NOVEL MALE SHE WILL SPONTANEOUSLY ABORT OR MISCARRY THOSE PEDUSIS TO VERY POWERFUL EFFECT IN HUMANS IT STILL CONTROVERSIAL WHETHER NOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT IT'S A VERY POWERFUL FAREMONAL EFFECT IN OTHER ANIMALS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE OF A FAREMON EFFECT IS CALLED THE VANDENBURG EFFECT NAMED AFTER THE PERSON WHO DESCOVERED THIS EFFECT WHERE YOU TAKE A FEMALE OF A GIVEN SPECIES THAT HAS NOT ENTERED PUBERTY YOU EXPOSE HER TO THE SCENT OR THE URINE FROM A SEXUALLY COMPETENT MEANING POST PUBERDAL MALE AND SHE SPONTANEOUSLY GOES INTO PUBERITY EARLIER SO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SCENT TRIGGER SOMETHING THROUGH THIS ACCESSORIAL FACTORY SYSTEM THIS IS A TRUE FAREMONAL EFFECT AND CREATES OVULATION RIGHT AND MENSTRUATION OR IN RODENS ITS AN ESTRA CYCL NOT A MENSTRA CYCLE SO THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE EXACTING THINGS HAPPEN IN HUMANS IN HUMANS AS I MENTION EARLIER THERE ARE CHEMICAL SENSING BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE INDEPENDENT OF THE NOSE AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE BUT THOSE ARE BASICALLY THE THREE PATHS BY WHICH SMELS ODORS IMPACT US SO I WANT A TALK ABOUT THE ACT OF SMELLING AND IF YOU ARE NOT SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY INTERESTED IN SMELL BUT YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHOIS INTERESTED IN MAKING YOUR BRAIN WORK BETTER LEARNING FASTER REMEMBERING MORE THINGS THIS NEXCELLAL SEGMENT IS FOR YOU BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT HOW YOU SMELL MEANING THE ACT OF SMELLING NOT HOW GOOD OR BAD YOU SMELL BUT THE ACT OF SMELLING SNIFFING AND INHALATION POWERFULLY IMPACTS HOW YOUR BRAIN FUNCTIONS AND WHAT YOU CAN LEARN AND WHAT YOU CAN'T LEARN BREATHING GENERALLY CONSISTS OF TWO ACTIONS INHALING AND EXHALING AND WE HAVE THE OPTION OF COURSE TO DO THAT THROUGH OU NOSE OR OUR MOUTH I'VE TALKED ON PREVIOUS EPISODES ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GREAT ADVANTAGES TO BEING A NASAL BREATHER AND THERE ARE GREAT DISADVANTAGES TO BEING A MOUTH BREATHER THERE ARE EXCELLENT BOOKS AND DATA ON THIS THERE'S THE RECENT BOOK BREATH BY JAMES NESTER WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK THAT DESCRIBE SOME OF THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF NASAL BREATHING AS WELL AS OTHER BREATHING PRACTICES THERE'S ALSO THE BOOK JAWS BY MYCHOLEGUES PAUL EARLIC AND SAN DRACAN WITH A FORWARD BY GERIDIMON AND AN INTRODUCTION B Y ROBERTS UPOLSKY FROM STAMFORD SO THAT'S A BOOK CHALK A BLOCK WITH HEAVY HITTER AUTHORS THAT DESCRIBES HOW BEING A NASAL BREATHER IS BENEFICIAL FOR JAW STRUCTURE FOR MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION ET CETERA BREATHING IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE SNIFFING ACTUALLY HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE WAY THAT YOU CAN ACQUIRE AND REMEMBER INFORMATION NOME SOBL'S GROUP ORIGINALLY AT YOU SEE BERKELEY AND THEN AT THE WHITESMAN INSTITUTE HAS PUBLISHED A NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT ILIKE TO DISCUSS TO DAY ONE OF THEM HUMAN NONAL FACTORY COGNITION PHASE LOCKED WITHINELATION THIS WAS PUBLISHED IN NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOR AN EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOWED THAT THE ACT OF INHALING HAS A COUPLE OF INTERESTING AND POWERFUL CONSEQUENCES FIRST OF ALL AS WE INHALE THE BRAIN INCREASES IN AROUSAL ARE LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND ATTENTION INCREASES WHEN WE INHALE AS COMPARED TO WHEN WE EXILE OF COURSE WITH EVERY INHALE THERE IS AN EXALE YOU COULD PROBABLY DOUBEL UP ON YOUR INHALES IF YOUR DOING SIZE OR SOMETHING PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE OFE TALKED ABOUT THESE BEFORCE OF DOUBLE INHALES FOLLOWED BY AN EXALE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR IF YOUR SPEAKING YURE GIN A CHANGEUR CADENCE AND RATIO OF INHALES AN EXALES BUT TYPICALLY WE INHALE THAN WE EXALE AS WE INHALE WHAT THIS PAPER SHOWS IS THAT THE LEVEL OF ALERTNESS GOES UP IN THE BRAIN AND THIS MAKES SENSE BECAUSE AS THE MOST PRIMITIVE AND PRIMORDIAL SENSE BY WHICH WE INTERACT WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT AND BRING CHEMICALS INTO OUR SYSTEM AND DETECT OUR ENVIRONMENT INHALING IS A CUE FOR THE REST OF THE BRAIN TO ESSENTIALLY TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOT JUST TO THE ODORS AS THE NAME OF THIS PAPER SUGGESTS HUMAN NON OL FACTORY COGNITION PASE LOCKED WITHINELATION WITH THAT MEANS IS THAT THE ACT OF INHALING ITSELF WAKES UP THE BRAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOUR PERCEIVING OR WHAT YOUR SMELLING AND INDEED SNIFFING AS AN ACTION INHALING AS AN ACTION HAS A POWERFUL EFFECT ON YOUR ABILITY TO BE ALERT YOUR ABILITY TO ATTEND TO FOCUS AND YOUR ABILITY TO REMEMBER INFORMATION WHEN WE EXHALE THE BRAIN GOES THROUGH A SUBTLE BUT NONE THE LESS SIGNIFICANT DIP IN LEVEL OF AROUSAL AND ABILITY TO LEARN SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN HOW SHOULD YOU USE THIS KNOWLEDGE WELL YOU COULD IMAGIN AND I THINK THIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR MOST PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON NASAL BREATHING WHILE DOING ANY KIND OF FOCUS WORK THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT YOU SPEAK OR EAT OR INJEST SOMETHING THERE IS A SEPARATE PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL NERAL SCIENCE THAT SHOW THAT INDEED IF SUBJECTS HUMAN SUBJECTS ARE RESTRICTED TO BREATHING THROUGH THEIR NOSE THEY LEARN BETTER THEN IF THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF BREATHING THROUGH THEIR MOUTH OR A COMMINATION OF THEIR NOSE AND MOUTH THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS INHUMANS USING MODERN TECHNIQUES FROM EXCELLENT GROUPS SO SNIFFING ITSELF IS A POWERFUL MODULATOR OF OUR COGNITION AN OUR ABILITY TO LEARN YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF WAYS TAT YOU MIGHT APPLY THAT AS A TOOL AND I SUGGEST THAT YOU PLAY WITH IT A BIT THAT IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME STAYING  STAYING AWAKE AND ALERT YOU HAVING HARD TIME REMEMBERING INFORMATION YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A KIND OF ATTENTION DEFISIT NONCLINICAL OF COURSE NASAL BREATHING OUGHT TO HELP EXTENDING OR MAKING YOUR INHALES MORE INTENSE OUGHT TO HELP NOW THIS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT CHEMICAL SENSING PERSAY BUT HERE'SWHERE IT GETS INTERESTING AND EXCITING IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE A VERY GOOD SENSE OF SMELL OR YOUR SOMEBODY WHO SIMPLY WANTS TO GET BETTER AT SMELLING AND TASTING THINGS YOU CAN ACTUALLY PRACTICE SNIFFING I KNOW THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT SIMPLY SNIFFING NOTHING SO DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS I GESS THE MICROPHONE SOR TO HAS A SMELL I GUESS A PEN DOESN'T HAVE A SMELL TURNS OUT THAT DOING A SERIES OF INHALES AND OF COURSE EACH ONE IS FOLLOWED BY AN EXHAL TEN OR FIFTEEN TIMES AND THEN SMELLING AN OBJECT LIKE AN OR INGE ORE OF ANOTHER IDEM OF FOOD OR EVEN THE SKIN OF SOMEBODY ELSE WILL LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN YOUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE THOSE ODORS NOW THEY'RE PROBABLY TWO REASONS FOR THAT ONE REASON IS THAT THE BRAIN SYSTEMS OF DETECTING THINGS ARE WAKING UP AS A MERE CONSEQUENSE OF INHALING O CASE SO THIS IS SORT OF THE A O FACTORY EQUIVALENT OF OPENING YOUR EYES WIDER IN ORDER TO SEE MORE OR LESS ONCA LAST EPISO TALK ABOUT OPENING YOUR EYES WIDER ACTUALLY INCREASES YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS CAUSES YOUR EYES TO BE OPEN WIDER OPEN YOUR EYES WIDER CAN ACTUALLY NCREASE YOUR LEVEL F ALERTNESS WHAT TURNS OUT THAT BREATHING MORE DEEPLY THROUGH THE NOSE WAKES UP YOUR BRAIN AND IT CREATES A HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY OF THE NURONS THAT RELATE TO SMELL AND THERE'S A CLOSE CROSS OVER I'M SURE YOU KNOW THIS BETWEEN SMELL AND TASTE IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HAD A COLD OR YOUE FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU'VE LOST YOUR SENSE OF SMELL YOU BECOME WHAT THEY CALL ANOSMIC YOUR SENSE OF TASTE SUFFERS ALSO WILL TALK A LITTLA BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT Y THAT IS IN A FEW MINUTES BUT AS A FIRST PROTOCAL I'D REALLY LIKE ALL OF YOU TO CONSIDER BECOMING NAZAL BREATHERS WHILE YOU'RE TRING TO LEARN WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO LISTEN WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO WAKE UP YOUR BRAIN IN ANY WAY AND LEARN AND RETAIN INFORMATION THIS IS A POWERFUL TOOL NOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO WAKE UP YOUR BRAIN MORE AS WELL FOR INSTANCE THE USE OF SMELLING SALTS I'M NOT RECOMMENDING THAT YOU DO THIS NECESSARILY BUT THERE ARE EXCELLENT PURE REVIEWED DATA SHOWING THAT INDEED IF YOU USE SMELLING SALTS WHICH ARE MOSTLY OF THE SORT A THAT INCLUDE A M ONIA EMMONIA IS A VERY TOXIC SENT BUT IT'S TOXIC IN AWAY THAT TRIGGERS THIS INNATE PATHWAY THE PATHWAY FROM THE NOSE TO THE EMIGULA AND WAKES UP THE BRAINBODY IN A MAJOR WAY IS WHY THEY USE SMELLING SALTS WHEN PEOPLE PASS OUT THIS IS WHY FIGHTERS USE TO USE OR MAY BE SOMETIMES STILL USE A SMELLING SALTS IN ORDER TO HEIGHTEN THEIR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS IS IS WHY POWER LIFTERS WILL IN HAL SMELLING SALTS THEY WORK BECAUSE THEY TRIGGER THE FEAR AND KIND OF OVERALL AROUSAL SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN THIS WHY THINK MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T USE A MONIAOR SMELLING SALTS TO TRY AND WAKE UP BUT THEY REALLY DO WORK IF YOU EVER SMELLD SMELLING SALTS AND I HAVE I TRIED THIS THEY GIVE YOU A SERIOUS JOLT IT'S LIKE SIXESPRESSO INFUSED IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM ALL AT ONCE YOU ARE WIDE AWAKE IMMEDIATELY AND YOU FEEL HEIGHTENED SENSE OF KIND OF DESIRE TO MOVE BECAUSE YOU RELEASE A DRENOLINE INTO YOUR BODY NOW INHALING THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND DOING NAZAL BREATHING IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A MORE SUBTLE VERSION OF WAKING UP YOUR SYSTEM OF ALERTING YOUR BRAIN OVER ALL END FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING A RICHER A OR DEEP CONNECTION TO THE THINGS THAT YOU SMELL AND TASTE INCLUDING OTHER INDIVIDUALS PERHAPS NOT JUST FOOD PRACTISING OR ENHANCING YOUR SENSE OF SNIFFING YOUR ABILITY TO SNIFF MIGHT SOUND LIKE A KIND OF RIDICULOUS PROTOCAL BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A KIND OF FUN AND COOL EXPERIMENT THAT YOU CAN DO YOU JUST DO THE SIMPLE EXPERIMENT OF TAKING FOR INSTANCE AN ORANGE YOU SMELL IT TRYINGAUGE YOUR LEVEL OF PERCEPTION OF HOW ORANGISH ITS SMELLS OR LEMON E LEMONISH LEMONE I ONO IS LEMONOUSH OR LEMONY LEMONY ITS SMELLS THEN SET IT AWAY DO TEN OR FIFTEEN INHALS FOLLOW BY THEXHALLS OF COURSE OR JUST THROUGH THE NOSE NOT CAN DO ALL TEN OR FIFTEEN AND THEN SMELL IT AGAIN YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YOUR PERCEPTION OF THAT SMELL THE THE KIND OF RICHNESS OF THAT SMELL WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AND THAT AGAIN FOR TWO REASONS ONE THE BRAIN IS IN A POSITION TO RESPOND TO IT BETTER YOUR BRAIN HAS BEEN AROUSED BY THE MERE ACT OF SNIFFING BUT ALSO THE NURONS THAT RESPOND TO THAT LEMON ODOR THAT LEMONE OR ODOR ARE GOING TO RESPOND BETTER SO YOU CAN ACTALLY HAVE A HEIGHTENED EXPERIENCE OF SOMETHING AND THAT OF COURSE WILL ALSO BE TRUE FOR THE TASTE SYSTEM YOU ALSO CAN REALLY TRAIN YOUR SENSE OF SMELL TO GET MUCH MUCH BETTER WHEN NOME SOBLE'S GROUP WAS AT BERKLAY APPEN TO BE AT GRADUATES TON AROUND THAT TIME AND EVERY ONE SON AWHILE IT LOOK OUTSIDE AND THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE CRAWLING AROUND ON THE GRASS WITH GOGGLES ON GLOVES ON AND THESE HOODS ON WITH EUR MOFFHS END THEY LOOKD RIDICULOUS BUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING IS THEY WERE ACTUALLY LEARNING TO FOLLOW SCENT TRAILS SO IN THE WORLD OF DOGS YOU HAVE SIGHT HOUNDS THAT USE THEIR EYES IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE AND OF FINE THINGS AND YOU HAVE SENT HOUNDS THAT USE THEIR NOSE AND THE SENDHOUNDS ARE REMARKABLE THEY CAN BE TRAINED TO DETECT DESCENT THESE ARE THE SNIFFING OF THE ON THE BOM SNIFFING IN THE DRUG SNIFFING DOGS IN AIR PORTS THERE ARE NOW DOGS ACTUALLY THAT CAN SNIFF OUT COVID INFECTIONS WITH A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY THAT CAN BE TRAINED TO THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE OF THE COVID OF AND SIMILAR INFECTIONS THAT THE BODY PRODUCES PROBABLY IN THE IMMUN RESPONSE SOME ODORS AND THE DOGS ARE I THINK AS HIGH AS NINETY PER CENT IN SOME CASES MAY BE THE NINETY FIVE PER CENT ACCURACY JUST REMARKABLE THERE ARE THEORIES THAT DOGS CAN SNIFF OUT CANCER THE STUFF ALL EXCEEDS STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE A STILL A LOWBIT MYSTERIOUS IN SOME WAYS BUT YOU MAY NOT EVER ACHIEVE THE OL FACTORY CAPABILITIES OF A SENT HOUND BUT WHAT NOME SOBLES IT LAB DID IS THEY HAD PEOPLE COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THEIR VISUAL EXPERIENCE BY HAVING THEM WEAR DARK GLASSES OR GOGGLES S THEY COULDN'T SEE THEY COULDN'T HEAR THEY COULDN'T SENSE ANYTHING WITH WITH THEIR SENSE OF TOUCH Y A THICK GLOVES ON BUT THEY HAD OF THESE MASS ON WHERE JUST THEIR NAZAL PASSAGES WERE OPEN AND PEOPLE COULD IN A ERLY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME LEARN TO FOLLOW A CHOCOLATE SENT TRAIL ON THE GROUND WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WANT TO DO BUT WHAT THEY SHOWED USING BRAIN IMAGING ET CETERA AND SUBSEQUENT STUDIES IS THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN YOU CAN LEARN TO REALLY ENHANCE YOUR SENSE OF SMELL AND BECOME VERY ASTUTE IN DISTINGUISHING WHETHER NOT ONE PARTICULAR ODOR COMBINATIONS OF ODORS IS SUCH THAT IT'S LLESS THAN OR MORE THAN A DIFFERENT ODOR FOR INSTANCE NOW WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THIS WELL IF YOU LIKE TO EAT AS MUCH AS I DO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN REALLY ENHANCE YOUR SENSE OF PLEASURE FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF INGESTING FOOD IS TO ENHANCE YOUR SENSE OF SMELL AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF SMELL OR IFYOU HAVE A SENSE OF SMELL THAT'S REALLY SO GOOD THAT IT'S ALWAYS PICKING UP BAD ODORS WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE WELL THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO TUN UP YOUR SENSE OF SMELL BY DOING THIS PRACTICE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN BREATHS EXCUSE ME SNIFFS NOT BREATHS SNIFFS AND THEN INTERACTING WITH SOME FOOD ITEM OR THING THAT YOUR INTERECIED IN SMELLING MORIFS THESE COULD BE THE INGREDIENTS THAT YOUR COOKING WITH I REALLY INCOURAGE YOU TO TRY REALLY SMELL THEM YOU SOMETIMES HEAR THIS AS KIND OF A MINDFULNESS PRACTICE LIKE WO REALLY SMELL THE FOOD REALLY TASTE THO FOOD AND WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT THAT AS KIND OF A MINDFULNESS AN PRESENTE THING BUT YOU ACTUALLY CAN INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF YOUR OF YOUR OLD FACTORY IN YOUR TASTE SYSTEM BY DOING THIS AND IT HAS LONG TERM EFFECTS THAT'S WHAT SO INTERESTING THIS ISN'T THE KIND OFTHING YOU HAVE TO DO EVERY TIME YOU EAT YOU DO'T HAVE TO BE THE WEIRDO AN THE RESTAURANT THAT'S LIKE PICKING UP THE RAD ISH ANLEANA LIKE JAMIN IT UP YOUR NOSTRILS PLEASE DON'T DO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECERELY SMELL EVERYTHING ALTHOUGH IT'S NICE SOMETIMES TO BE TO SMELL THE FOOD THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO EAT AND AS YOU EAT IT BUT IT HAS LONG TERM EFFECTS IN TERMS OF YOURABILITY TO DISTINGUISH AND DISCRIMINATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ODORS AND THESE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE VERY PUNGENT FOODS THAT TURNS OUT THE STUDIES SHOW THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOME REALLY STINKY CHEESE YOU KNOW THERE ARE CHIE SHOPS THAT I'VE WALKED IN TOR LIKE I JUS BASILY GAG I CANT HANDLE IT I JUST CAN'T BE IN THERE IS JUST  JUST OVERWHELMS ME OTHER PEOPLE THEY LOVE THAT SMELL SO YOET TO TUNE IT TO YORK INTEREST AND EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK EVEN FOR YOU FASTERS OUT THERE EVERYBODY EATS AT SOME POINT EVERYBODY INJESTS CHEMICALS THROUGH THEIR MOUTH AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN POWERFULLY INCREASE YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THT EXPERIENCE AND MAKE IT MUCH MORE POSITIVE IS THROUGH JUST THE OCCASIONAL PRACTICE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN SNIFFS OF NOTHING WHICH ALMOST SOUNDS RIDICULOUS LIKE HOW COULD THAT BE BUT NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY ITS BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE SNIFFING ACTIOND INCREASES THE ALERTNESS OF THE BRAIN AS WELL AS INCREASING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SYSTEM NO OTHER SYSTEM THAT I'M AWARE OF IN OUR BODY IS AS A MENABLE TO THESE KINDS OF BEHAVIORAL TRAINING SHIFTS AND ALLOW THEM TO HAPPEN SO QUICKLY I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT JUST DOING TEN OR FIFTEEN NEAR FAR EXERCISES WITH A PEN OR GOING OUTSIDE FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN SECONDS EACH MORNING IS GOING TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU SEE THE WORLD BUT IT ACTUALLY ISN'T THE CASE YOU ACTUALLY IT REQUIRES MORE TRAINING A LOBIT MORE EFFORT IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM IN THE OLL FACTORY SYSTEM AND YOUR SMELL SYSTEM AND IN YOUR TASTE SYSTEM JUST THE TINIEST BIT OF TRAINING AND A TENTION AND SNIFFING INHAILING CAN RATICALLY CHANGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO FOOD SUCH THAT YOU ACTUALLY START TO FEEL VERY DIFFERENT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INJESTING THOSE FOODS AS WELL AS BECOMING MORE DISCERNING ABOUT WHICH FOODS YOU LIKE AND WHICH ONES YOU DON'T LIKE AND WERE GON TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A REALLY WONDERFUL THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START DEVELOPING A SENSITIVE PALET AND A SENSITIVE SENSE OF SMELL IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GUIDE YOUR EATING AND SMELLING DECISIONS AND MAY BE VEN INTERPERSONAL DECISIONS ABOUT WHO YOU SPEND TIME WITH OR MAKE WITH OR WHATEVER IN A WAY THAT IS REALLY IN LINE WITH YOUR BIOLOGY IN FACT HOW WELL WE CAN SMELL AND TASTE THINGS IS ACTUALLY A VERY STRONG INDICATION OF OUR BRAIN HEALTH NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE A POOR SENSE OF SMELL OR A POOR SENSE OF TASTE THAT YOU'RE SOMEHOW BRAIN DAMAGE OR YOUR GOING A YOU KNOW YOU CAN T HAVE DOMENTIA ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES EARLY SIGNS OF DOMENTIA OR LOSS OF NURONS AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE BRAIN RELATE TO SAY PARKENSONS CAN SHOW UP FIRST AS A LOSS OF SENSE OF SMELL IT AGAIN I ITS NOT CAUSAL AND IT CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE THAT EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A SUDDEN LOSS OF SMELL THAT THOWS NECESSARILY BRAINDIMAGE I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT BUT THEY ARE OFTEN CORRELATED THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF INTERESTS RIGHT NOW IN LOSS OF SENSE OF SMELL BECAUSE ONE OF THE EARLY DETECTION SIGNS OF COVED NINETEEN WAS A LOSS OF SENSE OF SMELL SO I JUST BRIEFLY WONE TO TALK ABOUT LOSS OF SENSE OF SMELL AND REGAINING SENSE OF SMELL IN TASTE BECAUSE THESE HAVE POWERFUL IMPLICATIONS FOR OVER ALL HEALTH AND IN FACT CAN INDICATE SOMETHING ABOUT BRAIN DAMAGE AND CAN EVEN INFORM HOW QUICKLY WE MIGHT BE RECOVERING FROM SOMETHING LIKE A CONCUSSION S O OURAL FACTORY NURONS THESE NURONS IN OUR NOSE THAT DETECT ODORS ARE REALLY UNIQUE AMONG OTHER BRAIN NURONS BECAUSE THEY GET REPLENISHED THROUGHOUT LIFE THEY DON'T JUST REGENERATE BUT THEY GET REPLENISHED SO REGENERATION AS WHEN SOMETHING IS DAMAGED AND IT REGROWS THESE NURONS ARE CONSTANTLY TURNING OVER THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE SPEND ERE CONSTANTLY BEING REPLENISHED THEIR DYING OFF AND THEIR BEING REPLACED BY NEW ONES THIS IS AN AMAZING ASPECT OF OUR BRAIN THAT BASICALLY UNIQUE TO THESE NURONS ONE OTHER REGION OF THE BRAIN WHERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THIS MAYBE BUT THESE OL FACTORY NURONS ABOUT EVERY THREE OR FOUR WEEKS THEY DIE AND WHEN THEY DIE THEY ARE REPLACED BY NEW ONES THAT COME FROM A DIFFERENT REGION OF THE BRAIN A REGION CALLED THE SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE THE NAME ISN'T AS IMPORTANT BUT AS THE PHENOMENON BUT THESE NURONS ARE BORN IN THE VENTRICAL THE AREA OF YOUR BRAIN THAT'S A WHOLE THAT CONTAINS IT'S NOT AN EMPTY WHOLE ITS A WHOLE BASICALLY THAT CONTAINS CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID WELE THERE'S A LITTLE SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE THERE'S A LITTLE ZONE BELOW SUB THE VENTRICALS AND THAT ZONE IF YOU ARE EXERCISING REGULARLY IF YOURE DOPOMINE LEVELS ARE HIGH ENOUGH THOSE LITTLE SELLS THERE ARE LIKE STEMSELLS THEY ARE STEMSELVES AND THEY SPIT OUT WHAT ARE CALLED LITTLE NEURO BLASTS THOSE LITTLE NEURO BLASTS MIGRATE INTO THE FRONT OF YOUR BRAIN AND THEN CHIMMI THEY KIND OF MOVE THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED THE ROSTRIL MIGRATORY STREAM THEY CAN A CHIMMI ALONG AND LAND BACK IN YOURAL FACTORY BULB SETTLE DOWN AND EXTEND LITTLE WIRES INTO YUR O FACTORY MUKOSA THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OF WHAT WE CALL NEUROGENESIS OR THE BIRTH OF NEW NURONS NOW THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE OTHER NURONS IN YOUR CORTECS IN URRETNA IN YOUR CEREBELLUM THEY DO NOT DO THIS THEY ARE NOT CONTINUALLY REPLENISHED THROUGHOUT LIFE BUT THESE NURONSESOL FACTORY NURONS ARE THEY ARE SPECIAL AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEM TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OL FACTORY NURON NEUROGENESIS THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT EXERCISE BLOOD FLOW CAN INCREASE OL FACTORY NURON NEUROGENESIS ALTHOUGH THOSE DATA ARE FEWER IN COMPARISON TO THINGS LIKE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OR ACTUALLY INTERACTING WITH ODORANTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS SO FEARE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T SMELL THINGS WELL YOU HAVE A POOR SENSE OF SMELL YOURAL FACTORY SYSTEM DOESN'T SEEM VERY SENSITIVE MORE SNIFFING MORE SMELLING IS GOING TO BE GOOD AND THEN THE MOLECULE DOPOMINE THIS NEUROMODULATOR THAT IS ASSOCIATE WITH MOTIVATION AND DRIVE AND IN SOME CASES IF IT'S VERY VERY HIGH WITH MANIA OR IF IT'S VERY VERY LOW WITH DEPRESSION OR PARKINSINS BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE WHERE DOPOMINE IS IN ESSENTIALLY NORMAL RANGES DOPOMINE IS ALSO A POWERFUL TRIGGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE NEW NURONS AND TH EIR MIGRATION IN TO THE FACTORY BULB AND URABILITY TO SMELL NOW YOU DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE CORRELATION WITH CAUSATION SO IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT SMELLING DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE LO DOPOMI KNOW NOT NECESSARILY IF YOU HAVE LODOPAMINE DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE A POOR SENSE OF SMELL NO NOT NECESSARILY SOME PEOPLE WHO TAKE ANTI DEPRESSENCE OF THE SORT THAT IMPACT THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM STRONGLY LIKE WELL BUTRON WILL REPORT A SUDDEN MEANING WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS INCREASE IN THEIR ABILITY TO SMELL PARTICULAR ODORS AND ITS A VERY STRIKING EFFECT SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE DOPAMINE AND THE HORMONS TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NOVELTY AND THE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS THAT OFTEN ARE ASSOCIATE WITH NEW RELATIONSHIPS THOSE THREE MOLECULES DOPOMING TOSTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN CAN A WORK TOGETHER AND OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WILL SAY OR REPORT WHEN THEIR NEWLY IN LOVE OR IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY THEY'RE JUST OBSESSED WITH OR THEY JUST SO ENJOY THE SCENT OF ANOTHER PERSON SO MUCH SO THAT THEY LIKE TO BORROW THE OTHER PERSONS CLOTHING OR THEY'LL SNIFF THE OTHER PERSONS CLOTHING OR THEY CAN EVEN JUST IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PERSON THEY CAN IMAGINE THEIR SMELL AND FEEL A BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE SOMETHING THA WILL TALK MORE ABOUT SO THESE NURONS TURN OVER THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN AND AS WE AGE WE ACTUALLY CAN LOSE OUR SENSE OF SMELL AND IT'S LIKELY AN ONET UNDERSCORE LIKELY THAT THAT LOSS OF SENSE OF SMELL AS WE AGE IS CORRELATED WITH THE LOSS OF OTHER NURONS IN THERETINA IN THE EAR THE LOSS OF VISION LOSS OF HEARING LOSS OF SMELL LOSS OF THE SENSE APARATI WHICH ARE NURONS IS CORRELATED WITH AGING SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO DAY AS THE ABILITY TO SENSE THESE ODORS BUT WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS EMPOWER YOU WITH TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW UE TO KEEP THESE SYSTEMS TUNED UP LAST TIME WE TALKE ABOUT TUNING UP AND KEEPING YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM TUNED UP AND HEALTHY REGARDLESS OF AGE HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT REALLY ENHANCING THE YOURE OFACTORY ABILITIES YOUR TASTEABILITIES AS WELL BY INTERACTING A LOT WITH ODORS PREFERABLY POSITIVE ODORS AND SNIFFING MORE INHALING MORE WHICH ALMOST SOUNDS CRAZY BUT NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY ITS GROUNDED IN REAL MMECHANISTIC BIOLOGY OF HOW THE BRAIN WAKES UP AND RESPONDS TO THESE CHEMICALS NOW SPEAKING OF BRAIN INJURY OL FACTORY DISFUNCTION IS A COMMON THEME IN TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON THESE OLL FACTORY NURONS AS I MENTION EXTEND WIRES INTO THE MUCOSA OF THE NOSE BUT THEY ALSO EXTEND A WIRE UP INTO THE SKULL AND THEY EXTEND UP INTO THE SKULL THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED THE CRIBERFORM PLATE IS LIKE A SWISS CHEESE TIGHT PLATE WHERE THEIRE GOING THROUGH AND IF YOU GET AHEAD HIT THAT BONE THE CRIPERFORM PLATE SHEARS THOSE LITTLE WIRES OFF IN THOSE NURONS DIE NOW EVENTUALLY THEY'LL BE REPLACED BUT THEREIS A PHENOMENON BY WHICH CONCUSTION IN THE SEVERITY OF CONCUSSION AND THE RECOVERY FROM A HEAD INJURY CAN ACTUALLY BE GAGED IN PART IN PART N T IN HOLE BUT IN PART BY HOW WELL OR FULLY ONE RECOVERS THEIR SENSE OF SMELL SO IF YOUR SOMEBODY THEN FORTUNALLY AS SUFFERED A CONCUSSION YOUR SENSE OF SMELL IS ONE READ OUT BY WHICH YOU MIGHT VALUATE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR REGAINING SOME OF YOUR SENSORY PERFORMANCE OF COURSE HIT WILL BE OTHERS LIKE BALANCE IN COGNITION AND SLEEP ET CETERA BUT I LEKE TO REFER YOU TO A A REALLY NICE PAPER AM WHICH IS ENTITLED OR FACTORY DISFUNCTION IN TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY THE ROLE OF NEUROGENESIS THE FIRST AUTHOR IS MARIN M A R I N A THE PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN A CURRIN ALOGY AND ASMA REPORT THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY I SPEND SOME TIME WITH THIS PAPER IT'S QUITE GOOD IT'S A REVIEW ARTICLE I LIKE REVIEWS IF THER A PURE REVIEWED REVIEWS A AND IN QUALITY JOURNALS AND WHAT THEY DISCUSS IS AND I'LL JUST READ HERE BRIEFLY CAUSE THEY SAID IT BETTER THAN I COULD O FACTORY FUNCTIONING DISTURBANCES ARE COMMON FALLING TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY T BE I IN CANNAVE I SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO STANDARD TREATMENT FOR PATIONTS WITH A WITH THE LOSS OF SMELL NOW PARAPHRASING A POPOST INJURY OR FACTORY TRAINING HAS SHOWN PROMISE FOR BENEFICIAL EFFECTS SOME OF THIS INVOLVES I THEY GO ON TO TELL US THE ROLL OF DOPOMING DOPOMENERIC SIGNALLING AS I MENTION BEFORE BUT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS THAT IF YOUVE HAD A HEAD INJURY OR REPEATED HEAD INJURIES THAT INHANCING YOUR SENSE OF SMELL IS ONE WAY BY WHICH YOU CAN CREATE NEW NERANS TO NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO ENHANCE YOUR SENSE OF SMELL BY INTERACTING WITH THINGS THAT HAVE AN ODOR VERY CLOSELY AND BY ESSENTIALLY INHALING MORE FOCUSSING ON THE INHALE TO WAKE UP THE BRAIN AND TO REALLY FOCUS ON SOME OF THE NEUANTS OF THOSE SMELLS SO YOU MIGHT DO FOR INSTANCE A A SMELL TEST BY WHICH YOU SMELL SOMETHING LIKE A LEMON PUT IT DOWN DO TEN INHALES OR SO SMELL AGAIN ET CETERA YOU MIGHT ALSO JUST TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN TRING TO TASTE AND SMELL YOUR FOOD AND TASTE AND SMELL VARIOUS THINGS I MAN PLEASE DON'T INJEST ANYTHING THAT'S POISONOUS THAN YOU NOTS MUST BE INGESTING BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN REALLY TUNING UP THIS SYSTEM I THING IS AN EXCELLENT REVIEW AT WHICH WEREGOOED DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT THE USE OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO THE OFACTORY SYSTEM FOR TREATMENT OF TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AS WELL AS OTHER METHODS BUT I A WANTED TO JUST MENTION IT HERE BECAUSE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT T B EY AND HERE AGAIN WERE IN THIS PLACE WHERE THE SENSES AND OUR ABILITY TO SENSE THESE CHEMICALS TO THESE TWO HOLES IN THE FRONT OF OUR FACE ARE NOSTRILS IS A POWERFUL READ OUT AND WAY TO CONTROL BRAIN FUNCTION AND NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION GENERALLY JUST A QUICK NOTE ABOUT THE USE OF SMELLING SALTS I HAVE A FEELING THAT SOME OF YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THAT AND ITS APPLICATION IF YOU OR INTERESTIN THAT I RECOMMEND YOU GO TO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE FIRST RATHER THAN YOU KNOW STRAIGHT TO SOME VENDOR OR TO THE A WHAT ARE THEY CUALITIES IS COSTILL BRO SCIENCE HE SAYS BRO SCIENCE THE BRO SCIENCE YOU CAN GO TO THIS PAPER WHICH IS EXCELLENT AND IS REAL SCIENCE WHICH IS ACUTE EFFACTS OF AMMONIAANHALENTS ON STRENGTH AND POWER PERFORMANCE IN TRAINED MEN IT'S A R ANIMIZED CONTROL TRIAL IS PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL STRENGTH AND CONDITION IN RESEARCH IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SHOULD BE VERY EASY TO FINE I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE SO CALLED PUPMED IDEA WHICH IS A STRING OF OF A NUMBERS AND WILL PUT THAT IN THE CAPTION IF YOU WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO THAT ARTICLE DOES SHOW A SIGNIFICANT OM WHAT THEY CALL THIS IS WHAT THE WORDS THEY USE LITERALLY IN QUOTE PSYCHING UP EFFECT A THROUGH THE A USE OF THESE AMMONIA INHELLMENTS AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MAXIMAL FORCE IN FORCE DEVELOPMENT IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT A MOVEMENCE SO FOR THOSE W EBETHERE INTERESTED IN AMMONIA NHELLENTS A SO CALLED SMELLING SALTS A THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD REFERENCE THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WITH REFERENCE TO ODORS IS THIS MIFF WHICH IS THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY SMELL THINGS IN OUR DREAMS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF SMELL THAT'S PURE FICTION ANONAW WHO CAME UP WITH THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF SMELLING THINGS IN OUR SLEEP HOWEVER WHEN WE ARE IN REM SLEEP RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP WHICH IS THE SLEEP THAT PREDOMINATES TOWARD THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT OUR ABILITY TO WAKE UP IN RESPONSE TO ODORS IS DIMINISHED IT'S NOT ABSENT BUT IT'S DIMINISHED IF SMOKE COMES INTO THE ROOM WE WILL LIKELY WAKE UP IF THE CONCENTRATION OF SMOKE IS HIGH ENOUGH REGARDLESS OF THE STAGE OF SLEEP WEREIN BUT IN REM SLEEP WE TEND TO BE LESS LIKELY TO SMELL TO SNIFF AND THAT ACTUAL AS MEASURED IN A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT SNIFFING IN SLEEP IS POSSIBLE SO IF YOU PUT AN ODOR LIKE A LEMON UNDERNEATH SOME ONE'S NOSTRILS IN THE EARLY A PORTION OF THE NIGHT THEY WILL SMELL AND THEY WILL LATER THEY WILL SNIFSCUSE ME AM WHETHER NOTHING SMELL OR NOT I GUESS DEPENDS ON ON THEMON WHEN THE SHOWERED LASS BUT THEY WILL DEFINALY SNIFF AND THEY WILL REPORT LATER ESPECIAL IF YOU WAKE THEM UP SOON AFTER THAT THEY HAD A DREAM OR PERCEPT OF A THE SENT OF A LEMON FOR INSTANCE LATER IN THE NIGHT IT'S HARDER FOR THAT RELATIONSHIP TO BE ESTABLISHED ITS LIKELY THAT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE PARALYSIS ASSOCIATED WITH RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP WHICH IS A HEALTHY PARALYSIS SO CALLD SLEEP AT TONIA NO ONE ACT OUT YOUR DREAMS IN REMSLEEP THAT THERE IS A LESS ACTIVE TENDENCY TO SNIFF AND ACTUALLY THIS HAS REAL CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS THE ABILITY TO SNIFF IN RESPONSE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ODOR IS ACTUALLY ONE WAY IN WHICH CLINITIONS ASSESS WETHER NOT SOMEBODY'S BRAIN IS SO CALLED BRAIN DEAD IT'S NOT NICE TURN BUT BRING DEAD OR WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RECOVER FROM THINGS LIKE COMA AND OTHER STATES OF DEEP UNCONSCIOUSNESS OR I GUSS YOU CALL IT SUBCONSCIOUSNESS SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IF SOME ONE HAS AN INJURY IN THEIR THEIR RESENCILLY OUT COLD THE PRODUCTION OF A OF A SNIFFING REFLEX OR SNIFFING RESPONSE TO SAY A LEMON OR SOME OTHER ODOR PRESENTED BELOW THE NOSTRILS IS CONSIDERED A SIGND THAT THE BRAIN IS CAPABLE OF WAKING UP NOW THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT ITS ONE INDICATION SO JUST LIKE YOU COULD USE MECHANIC MECHANOC SENSATION SOA YOU KNOW A TO PINCH FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW OR OR SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF SOMEBODY'S BAREFOOT TO SEE IF THEIRE CONSCIOUS OR OM SHINING LIGHT IN THEIR EYES THESE AREALL THINGS THAT YOU'VE SEEN TO MOVIES INTELIVISION OR MAY BE  YOU'VE SEEN IN REAL LIFE AS WELL WELL ODORS AND CHEMICAL SENSING IS ANOTHER WAY BY WHICH YOU CAN ASSESS WHETHER NOT THE BRAIN IS CAPABLE OF AROUSAL AND ACTUALLY OL FACTORY STIMULATION IS IS ONE OF THE MORE PROMINENT ONES THAT'S BEING USED IN VERIOUS CLENIXS AS A LAST POINT ABOUT SPECIFIC ODORS AND COMPOUNDS THAT CAN INCREASE AROUSAL AND ALERTNESS AND THIS IS SIMPLY THROUGH SNIFFING THEM NOT THROUGH INJESTING THEM THERE ARE DATA BELIEVE ARE NOT THERE ARE GOOD DATA ON PEPPERMENT AND THE SMELL OF PEPPERMENT MINTI TYPE SENSE WHETHER YOU LIKE THEM OR NOT WILL INCREASE ATTENTION AND THEY CAN CREATE THE SAME SORT OF AROUSAL RESPONDSE ALTHOUGH NOT AS INTENSELY OR AS DRAMATICALLY AS AMMONIA SALTS CAN FOR INSTANCE BY THE WAY PLEASE DON'T GO SNIFF REAL AMMONIA YOU COULD ACTUALLY DAMAGE OURAL FACTORY APOTHELIUM IF YOU DO THAT TOO CLOSE TO THE AMMONIA IF YOUR CAN U SMELLING SALTS BE SURE YOU WORK WITH SOME ONE OR OU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AND HOW YOU'RE USING THIS YOU CAN DAMAGE YOUR AL FACTORY PATHWAY IN WAYS THAT ARE PRETTY SEVERE YO CAN ALSO DAMAGE YOUR VISION YOU'VE EVER TEERED UP BECAUSE YOU INHALE SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY NOXIOUS THAT IS NOT A A GOOD THING DOESN'T MEANY NECESSARILY CAUSE DAMAGE BUT IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE IRRITATED THE MUCOSAL LINING AND YOU DON'T POSSIBLY EVEN THE SURFACES OF YOUR EYES SO PLEASE BE VERY VERY CAREFUL SENSE LIKE PEPPERMENT LIKE THESE AMMONIA SMELLING SALTS THE REASON THEY WAKE YOU UP IS BECAUSE THEY TRIGGER SPECIFICAL FACTORY NORONS THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE SPECIFIC CENTERS OF THE BRAIN NAMELY THE AMIGDALA AND ASSOCIATED NORAL CIRCUITORY AND PATHWAYS THAT TRIGGER ALERTNESS OF THE SAME SORT THAT A COL SHOWER OR AN ICE BATH OR SUDDEN SURPRISE OR A STRESSFUL TEXT MESSAGE WOULD EVOKE REMEMBER THE SYSTEMS OF YOUR BODY THAT PRODUCE AROUSAL AND ALERTNESS AND ATTENTION IN THAT CUE YOU FOR OPTIMA LEARNING ACA FOCOUS THOSE ARE VERY GENERAL MECHANISMS THEY INVOLVE VERY BASIC MOLECULES LIKE A DRENALINE AN EPINEFFERENCE SAME THING ACTUALLY A DRENALINE EPIN EFFERN THE NUMBER OF STIMULE WHETHER IT'S PEPPERMENT OR AMMONIA OR A LOUD BLAST THE NUMBER OF STIMULE THAT CAN INVOKE THAT A DRENALINE RESPONSE IN THAT WAKE UP RESPONSE OR NEAR INFINITE AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IT WAS DESIGN TO TAKE ANY VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STIMULE PLACE THEM INTO CATEGORIES AND THEN ENVOKE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF VERY GENERAL RESPONSES NOW YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT OLD FACTION AND HOW THE SENSE OF SMELL WORKS HERE'S ANOTHER EXPERIMENT THAT YOU CAN DO I'LL ASK YOU RIGHT NOW DO YOU LIKE HATE OR ARE YOU INDIFFERENT TO THE SMELL OF MICROWAVE POP CORN SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING ONE MEMBER OF MY PODCAS STAFF SAYS IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING TO THEM THEY THEY FEEL LIKE ITS COMPLETELY NAUSEATING I DON'T MIND IT ALL IN FACT I KIND OF LIKE IT I THING THE SMELL OF MICRAT POPCORN IS KIND OF PLEASANT I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE IT BUT IT CERTAINLY NOT UNPLEASANT SOME PEOPLE HAVE A GENE THAT MAKES THEM SENSITIVE TO THE SMELL OF THINGS LIKE MICHROWAVE POPCORN SUCH THAT IT SMELLS LIKE VOMIT I PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THAT GENE BECAUSE I FIND THE SMELL OF MICHRAWAVE POPCORN PRETTY PLEASANT SOME PEOPLE HATE THE SMELL OF CYLANTRO SOME PEOPLE IN GEST A SPARAGUS AND WHEN THEY URINATE THEY CAN SMELL THE ASPARAGUS IN A VERY PUNGENT WAY OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T SMELL IT AT ALL THESE ARE VARIANCE INGENES THAT IN CODE FOR WHAT ARE CALLED ULFACTORY RECEPTERS EACH OLL FACTORY CENSORY NERON EXPRESSES ONE ODORANT GENE ONE GENE THAT CODES FOR RECEPTR THAT RESPONDS TO A PARTICULAR ODOR IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT GENE YOU WILL NOT RESPOND TO THAT ODOR SO THE REASON WHY SOME PEOPLE FIND THE SMELL OF MICRATE POK CORN TO BE VERY NOXIOUS PUTRID IN FACT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GENE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SMELL THE KIND OF PUTRED ODOR WITHIN THAT OTHER PEOPLE WHO LACK THAT GEN UST SIMPLY CAN'T SMELL IT SO WE ARE NOT ALL THE SAME WITH RESPECT TO OUR CENSORY EXPERIENCE WHAT ONE PERSON FINDS DELICIOUS ANOTHER PERSON MIGHT FIND DISCUSTING I'LL GIVE A GOOD EXAMPLE WHICH IS THAT I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE GORGANSOLA AND BLUE CHEESE I ABSOLY DESPISE IT IT IT SMELLS AND TASTES LIKE DIRTY MOULDY SOCKS TO ME SOME PEOPLE LOVE IT THEY CRAVE IT ACTUALLY SOME PEOPLE GET A VICERAL RESPONSE TO IT AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW CERTAIN TASTES CAN ACTUALLY EVOKE VERY DEEP BIOLOGICAL RESPONSEIS EVEN HORMONAL RESPONSES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TASTE IN A FEW MINUTES BUT THERE ARE THESE ODORS FOR INSTANCE IN POP CORN ITS THE MOLECULE TWO ACEDALE ONE PYROLINE NOT PROLINE BUT PYROLINE THAT GIVES OFF TO SOME PEOPLE LIKE ME A TOASTED SMELL AS THE SUGARS IN THE CELNEL'S HEAT BUT THE COMPOUND IS ALSO FOUND IN THINGS LIKE WHITE BRED IN JASMIN RISE WHICH DON'T HAVE AS PUNGENT AN ODOR BUT SOME PEOPLE SMELL THAT AND IT SMELLS LIKE CAT URINE NOW THERE ARE SENSE LIKE MUSKY SENSE AND MUSTY SENSE THAT ARE SECRETED BY ANIMALS LIKE SCUNCKS AND OTHER ANIMALS OF THE SO CALLED MUSCULID FAMILY SO THESE WOULD BE FERRETS AND OTHER ANIMALS THAT CAN SPRAY AND RESPONSE TO A FEAR OR IF THEY JUST WANT A MARKE TERRITORY BECAUSE THEY WANT  AY THAT'S MINE DOGS INCENTLLY HAVE SENT GLANDS OF THE RUB ON THINGS CATS HAVE THEM TO THIS MUSKY ODOR SOME PEOPLE FIND ACTUALLY QUITE PLEASANT SOME PEOPLE FIND IT TO BE VERY NOXIOUS AND THAT WILL DEPEND OF COURSE ON THE CONCENTRATION RIGHT I'LL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST T IME COSTELLO GOT SPRAYED BY A SKUNK AND IT WAS AWFUL I SHEU DON'T MIND THE SMELL OF SKUNK AT A DISTANCE OM IT'S ECTUALLY E LIIBIT PLEASANT I ADMIT IT'S A LILIMIT PLEASANT TO ME I'D ONLY THT MAKES ME TOO WEIRD BECAUSE IF YOU EVER READ THE BOOK ALL'S QUITE ON THE WESTERN FRONT ABOUT WORLD WORE ONE THEREIS A DESCRIPTION IN THERE ABOUT THE SMELL OF SKUNK AT A DISTANCE BEING MILDLY PLEASANT SO THE AUTHOR OF THAT BOOK PROBABLY SHARED A SIMILAR O FACTORY PROFILE A TO ME OR I TO THEM RATHER BUT SOME PEOPLE FIND EVEN THE TINIEST BIT OF THE SMELL OF SKUNK OR MUST TO BE NOXIOUS OR AWFUL NOW OF COURSE IN HIGH CONCENTRATIONS IT'S REALLY AWFUL AND UNFORTUNING POR COSTELLO HE WAS LIKE LITERALLY RED EYED AND JUST SNORTING AND IT WAS AWFUL THERE'S A JOKE ABOUT DOGS AT SAYS IT DOGS A EITHER GET SKUNKED ONE TIME AND NEVER AGAIN OR FIFTY OR A HUNDRED TIMES COSTELLO HAS BEEN SKUNK NO FEWER I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP HAS BEEN SKUNK NO FEWER THAN A HUNDRED AND THREE TIMES AND THAT'S BECAUSE IF HE SEES SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHINGIN THE BUSHES HE JUST GOES STRAIGHT AND HE DOES NOT LEARN BUT IF YOU LIKE THIS THE MUSKY SENT OR MUSKY SENT WELL THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE GENES THAT YOU EXPRESS IN YOUR FACTORY NURANS IT IS IN COMPLETELY INHERITED AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT SEN IF IT'S REALLY NOXIOUS OR YOU OVE THIS RESPONSEOR MICROA POPCORN WILL THAT MEANS YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT COMPLIMENT A DIFFERENT A CONSTELLATION IF YOU WILL OF GENES THAT MAKE UP FOR THESE OLD FACTORY CENSORY NURANS AND THE RECEPTORS THAT THEY EXPRESS LET'S TALK ABOUT TASTE NOT WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE TASTE OR YOU DON'T HAVE TASTE IRE'S NO WAY FOR ME TO ASCESS THAT BUT RATHER HOW WE TASTE THINGS MEANING HOW WE SENSE CHEMICALS IN FOOD AND IN DRINK THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY FIVE BUT SCIENTISTS NOW BELIEVE THERE MAY BE SIX THINGS THAT WE TASTE ALONE OR IN COMBINATION THEY ARE SWEET TASTE SALTY TASTE BITTER TASTE SOUR TASTE AN UMAMMI TASTE MOST OF YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF UMAMI BY NOW IT'S U M A M I UMAMMI IS ACTUALLY THE NAME FOR A PARTICULAR RECEPTOR THAT YOU EXPRESS ON YOUR TONGUE THAT ITS THAT DETECTS SAVORY TASTE SO IT'S THE KIND OF THING IN BRAZED MEATS SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN EVEN GET THE A ACTIVATION OF UMAMI BY TOMATOES OR TOMATO SAUCES WHAT ARE EACH OF THESE TASTES AND TASTE RECEPTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THEY WELL TALK ABOUT THE SIXTH MA YOU CAN GUESS WHAT IT IS I DON'TKNO IF YOU CAN GUESS IT NOW I COULDN'T GUESS IT BUT OF THE FIVE TASTE EACH ONE HAS A SPECIFIC UTILITY OR FUNCTION EACH ONE HAS A PARTICULAR GROUP OF NURONS IN YOUR MOUTH IN YOUR TONGUE BELIEVE IT OR NOT THAT RESPONDS TO PARTICULAR CHEMICALS AND PARTICULAR CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IT IS A TOTAL MYTH COMPLETE FICTION THAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR TONGUE HARBOR DIFFERENT TASTE RECEPTORS OW THAT HIGH SCHOOL TEXBOOK DIAGRAM THAT YOU KNOW SWEET IS IN ONE PART OF THE TONGUE AND SOURS IN ANOTHER AND BITTERS IN ANOTHER COMPLETE FICTION JUST TOTAL FICTION RELATED TO VERY OLD STUDIES THAT WERE PERFORMED IN A VERY POORLY CONTROLLED WAY NO SERIOUS BIOLOGISTS AND CERTAINLY KNOWN THAT WORKS ON TASTE WOULD CONTEND THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT THE TASTE RECEPTORS ARE ORGANIZE THEY ARE COMPLETELY INTERMIXED ALONG YOUR TONGUE IF YOU HAVE HEIGHTENED OR DECREES SENSITIVITY TO ONE OF THOSE FIVE THINGS I MENTION SWEET SALTY BITTER UMAMIAR SOUR AT ONE LOCATION YOUR TONGUE AT LIKELY REFLECTS THE DENSITY OF OVER ALL RECEPTERS OR SOMETHING GOING ON IN YOUR BRAIN BUT NOT THE DIFFERENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE RECEPTORS SO THE SWEET RECEPTERS ARE NURONS THAT EXPRESS A RECEPTR THAT RESPON TO SUGARS IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU HAVE CONES PHOTARECEPTERS IN YOUR EYE THAT RESPOND TO SHORT MEDIUM OR LONG WAY OF LENGTH LIGHT MEANING BLUE ISH GREEN ISH OR REDDISH LIGHT YOU HAVE A NURON IN OR NURONS PLURAL IIN YOUR TONGUE THAT RESPON TO SUGARS AND THEN THOSE NURONS THEY DON'T SAY SWEET THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SEND ANY SUGAR INTO THE BRAIN THEY SEND WHAT WE CALL A VOLLEY A BERAGE OF ACTION POTENTIALS OF ELECTRAL SIGNALS OFF INTO THE BRAIN IT'S AN AMAZING SYSTEM SO ALL THESE RECEPTORS IN YOUR TONGUE MAKE UP WHAT ARE CALLED THE NURONS THAT GIVE RISE TO A NERVE A COLLECTION OF WIRS NERVE BUNDLES OF WHAT'S CALLED THE GUSTATORY NERVE IT GOES FROM THE TONGUE TO THE SO CALLED NUCLIOUS OF THE SOLITARY TRACTS AND SOME YOU REQUESTED NAMES I USUALLY DON'T LIKE TO CONCLUDE TO ANY NAMES FOR A SAKE OF CLARITY BUT THE GUSTATORY NERVE FROM THE TONGUE GOES TO THE NUCLIUS OF THE SOLITARY TRACT AND THEN TO THE FALAMUS AND TO INSOLAR QUARTEC YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THOSE NAMES IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUT IF YOU WANT MECHANISM YOU WANT NERL CIRCUITS THAT'S THE CIRCUIT GUSTATORY NERVE FROM THE TONGUE NEUCLIS THA SOLITARY TRACT IN THE BRAINSTEM THAN THE FHALAMUS AND THEN INSOLAR QUARTECS AND IT IS IN INSOLAR QUARTEX THIS REGENTEROR QUARTEX THAT WE SOARED OUT AND MAKE SENSE OF IN PERCEIVE THE VARIOUS TASTE NOW IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE JUST TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR OR SOMETHING SOUR LIKE A LOBITO LEMON JUICE AND TOUCHING IT TO THE TONGUE WITHIN ONE HUNDRED MILLOSECONDS I JUST ONE HUNDRED MILL SECONDS FAR LESS THAN ONE SECOND YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY DISTINGUISH AH THAT SOUR THATS SWEET THAT'S BITTER THAT'S UMAMI AND THAT'S AN ASCESSMENT THAT'S MADE BY THE QUARTEC NOW WHAT TO THESE DIFFERENT FIVE RECEPTERS IN COD FOR WELL SWEET SALTY BITTER UMAMI SOUR BUT WHAT ARE THEY REALLY LOOKING FOR WHAT ARE THEY SENSING WELL SWEET STUFF SIGNALS THE PRESENTS OF ENERGY OF SUGARS AND WHILE WE'RE ALL TRYING OR WERE TOLD THAT WE SHOULD EAT LESS SUGAR FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THE ABILITY TO SENSE WHETHER OR NOT A FOOD HAS RAPID ENERGY SOURCE OR COULD GIVE RISE TO GLUCOS IS ESSENTIAL SO WE HAVE SWEET RECEPTORS THE SALTY RECEPTORS THESE NURONS ARE TRYING TO SENSE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ELECTROLIHTS IN I GIVEN FOOD OR DRINK ELECTROLIGTES ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE FUNCTION OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AN FOR OUR ENTIRE BODY SODIUM IS WHAT ALLOWS NURONS TO FIRE WHAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE WE ALSO NEED POTASSUM IN MAGNESIUM THOSE OF THE IONS THAT ALLOW THE NURONS TO BE ACTIVE SO THE SALTY RECEPTORS THE REASON THAT THEY ARE THERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING ENOUGH BUT NOT TOO MUCH SALT WE DON'T WANT INGEST THINGS THAT ARE FAR TOO SALTY BITTER RECEPTORS ARE THERE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T INGEST THINGS THAT ARE POISONOUS HOW DO I KNOW THIS HOW CAN I SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH I WAS DEFINLY NOT CONSULTED AT THE DESIGN FASE HOW CAN I SAY THAT WELL THE BITTER RECEPTORS CREATE A WHAT WE CALL LABELLED LINE A UNIQUE TRAJECTORY TO THE NURONS OF THE BRAINSTEM THAT CONTROL THE GAG REFLECTS IF WE TASTE SOMETHING VERY BITTER IT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERS THE GAG REFLECTS NOW SOME PEOPLE LIKE BITTER TASTES ACHALLY LIKE THE TASTE OF BITTER COFFEE CHILDREN GENERALLY LIKE SWEET TASTES MORE THAN BITTER TASTES BUT EVEN BABIES IF THEY TASTE SOMETHING BITTER THEY'LL DISIMMEDIATELY SPITTED UP IS LIKE THE GAG REFLECTS PUTRIT SMELLS WILL ALSO EVOKE THESE SAME NURONS SO SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSIVE THEY HAVE A VERY SENSITIVE OR LOW THRESHOLD VOMIC REFLECTS YOU CAN  THERE WAS SOMEBODY IN MY LABORLIN A WE NEVER DO THIS INTENTION WHICH IS LAVICG IS IT WAS SO DRAMATIC HOW WE WOULD HAVE A DISCUSSION SOME ONE WOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT SOMETHING KIND OF A GROSS A APPROPRIATE FOR THE WORK PLACE BUT NONE THE LESS GROWSS WE ARE BIOLOGISTS WOULD SAY SOME THING AND THEY WOULD SAY STOPS A STOP OM ON A THROW UP  YOU KNOW AND SOMEPEOPLE HAVE A VERY LOW THRESHOLD QUICK GAG REFLECTS OTHER PEOPLE DON'T OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A VERY STABLE STOMAC THEY DON'T THAT YOUKNOW THEY RARELY IF EVER VOMIT THE UMAMI RECEPTOR ISN'T SENSING SAVORY BECAUSE THE BODY LOVES SAVORY IT'S BECAUS SAVORY IS A SIGNAL FOR THE PRESENCE OF A MENO ACIDS AND WI'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS BUT THE PRESENCE OF A MENO ACIDS IN OUR GUT AND IN AR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THE PRESENCE OF FATY ACIDS IS ESSENTIAL THERE IS IN FACT NO ESSENTIAL CARBOHYDRATE OR SUGAR I'M NOT A HUGE PROPONA OF KETOGENICDITES NORAMI AGAINST THEM I THINK IT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL YEU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU BUT EVERYBODY NEEDS A MENO ACIDS TO SURVIVE THE BRAIN NEEDS THEM END WE NEED FATY ACIDS ESPECIALLY TO BUILD A HEALTHY BRAIN DURING DEVELOPMENT YOU NEED A MEENO ACIDS AND FATY ACIDS AN THE SOUR RECEPTOR WHY WOULD WE HAVE A SOUR RECEPTOR SO THAT WE CULD HAVE THOSE REALLY LIKE A SOUR CANDIES I THINK THEY'VE GON MORE AND MORE SOUR OVER THE EARS I ADMIT I DON'T EAT CANDY MUCH BUT I DO HAVE A PARTICULAR WEAKNESS FOR LIKE A A REALLY GOOD REALLY SOUR LIKE GUMMY PEACH OR THAT IF THE GUMMY CHERRIES ARE DIPPED IN WHATEVER THAT SOUR POWDER SOT I WAS A KID WHO NI ADMITT I LIKE THE LIKE A MADE THING I'L LI DRINK THE POWDTER PLEASE DON'T DO THIS DON'T GIVE THE GARBAGE CHEER KIDS UM BUT I LIKED IT IS TASTY BUT SOUR RECEPTORS ARE NOT THERE SO THAT YOU CAN INJEST GUMMY SOUR GUMMY PEACHES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAT'S NOT WHY HAT THE SYSTEM OF ALL IT'S THERE AND WE KNOW IT'S THERE TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF SPOILED OR FERMENTED FOOD FERMENTED FRUIT HAS A SOUR ELEMENT TO IT AND FERMENTED THINGS WHILL CERTAINLY SUM FERMENTOD FOODS LIKE SOUR CRAUT AND KIM CHEE AND THINGS THAT SORT CAN BE VERY HEALTHY FOR US AND ARE VERY HEALTHY IN REDUCING INFLAMMATION THEIR GERY DAT ON THAT UM PRO A QUALITY MICROBIOM ET CETERA FERMENTED FRUIT CAN BE POISONOUS RIHTE ALKOHOLS ARE POISONOUS IN MANY FORMS TO OUR SYSTEM AND THE SOUR RECEPTOR BEARING NURONS COMMUNICATE TO AN AREA OF THE BRAIN STEM THAT EVOKES THE POCKER RESPONSE CLOSING OF THE EYES AND A SENTIAL SHUTTING OF THE MOUTH AND CRINGING AWAY THINCRINGES LIKE A THING NOW MY NIECE WHENEVER I SEEM TO SAY SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING IT'S EITHER AN IROL A CRINGE OR BOTH IN COMMINATION SO THE SOUR THE SWET THE SALTY THE BITTER AND THE UMAMI SYSTEM WE'RE NOT THERE SO THAT WE COULD HAVE THIS WONDERFUL POLLET OF FOODS THAT WE ENJOY SO MUCH THEY'LL ALLOW US TO DO THAT BUT THEY'RE THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING IN CERTAIN THINGS TO OUR SYSTEM AND THAT WE DON'T ENJEST OTHER THINGS NOW WHAT'S THE SIXTH SENSE WITHIN THE TASTE SYSTEM NOT SIX TENTE GENERALLY BUT WITHIN THE TASTES ON WHAT'S THIS PUTATIVE POSSIBLE SIX RECEPTER I ALREADY KOND HINTED AT IT WHEN I TALKED ABOUT FATY ACIDS THERE ARE NOW DATA TO SUPPORT THE IDEA ALTHOUGH THERE STILL MORE WORTH THAT NEDS TO BE DONE THAT WE ALSO HAVE RECEPTORS ON OUR TONGUE THAT SENTS FAT AND THAT BECAUSE FAT IS SO VITAL FOR THE FUNCTION OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE OTHER ORGANS OF OUR BODY THAT WE ARE SENSING THE FAT CONTENT IN FOOD MAYBE THIS IS WHY I CAN ONLY EAT HALF BUT NO LESS THAN HALF OF A JAR OF OMIN BUTTER OR PENIT BUTTER IN ONE SITTING I JUST CAN UNLESS IT'S NOT SALT IN WHICH CASE IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME BUT IT'S REMARKABLE HOW THAT TEXTURE AND ALSO THE FLAVOR BUT THAT TEXTURE OF FAT I LOVE BUTTER I AM GUILTY AND COSTELLA IS DEFILING GUILTY OF EATING PATS OF BUTTER FROM TIME TO TIME I HAVE NO GUILT ABOUT THIS PEOPLE EAT PATS OF CHEESE WHY SHOULD WE EAT A PAT OF BUTTER IF YOU THINK THAT'S GROSS THAN UM MAYBE I HAVE GREATER ABUNDANCE OF THE FAT RECEPTORS IN MY TONGUE MAY BE HAVE A FAT TONGUE UM THAN YOU DO BUT NONE THE LESS THE ABILITY TO SENSE FAT HERE IN OUR MOUTH SEEMS TO BE CRITICAL YOU CA IMAGINE WH Y THAT IS I WANT A TALK ABOUT THE TONGUE AND THE MOUTH AS AN EXTENSION OF YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT I KNOW THAT MIGHT NOT BE PLEASANT TO THINK ABOUT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE LENS THAT I'M ABOUT TO PROVIDE IT WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT THE GUT BRAIN AND ABOUT ALL THE STUFF WEU'VE HEARD IN THESE RECENT YEARS ABOUT OH YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SECOND BRAIN IS ALL THESE NURONS AND ARE GOT I'VE EVEN CHUCKLING THROUGH THESE LAST A FEW YEARS AS PEOPLE GOTTEN SO EXCITED ABOUT THE GUTBRAIN NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR EXCITEMENT I THNK THAT EXCITEMENT IS WONDERFUL BUT WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM EXTENDED OUT OF THE BRAIN AND INTO THE BODY AND PEOPLE SEEM CAN HAVE OVERWHELMED AND SURPRISED BY THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE NURONS AND OUR GUT THAT CONSENSE THINGS LIKE SUGARS AND FATTY ACIDS AND I THNK THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL DISCOVERIES DON'T GET ME WRONG GIEGOBORESES LAP OUT OF DUKE UNIVERSITY IS DONE BEAUTIFUL STUDY SHOWING THAT WITHIN THE MUCOSAL LINING OF OUR GUT WE HAVE NURONS THAT SENTS FATTY ACIDS SUGARS AND A MENO ACIDS AND THAT WHEN WE INJEST SOME THING THAT CONTAINS ONE OR TWO OR THREE OF THOSE THINGS THERE'S A SIGNAL SENT VI THE VAGUEST NERVE UP INTO WHAT'S CALLED THE NODOSE GANGLIN AND O D O S E AND THEN INTO THE BRAIN WHERE IT SECRETES DOPEMING WHICH MAKES US WANT MORE OF THAT THING IT MAKES US MORE MOTIVATED TO PURSUE AND EAT MORE OF THAT THING THAT'S EITHER FATY OR MAMI T SAVORY OR HAS A SWEET TASTE ANY ONE OR TWO OR THREE OF THOSE A QUALITIES INDEPENDENT OF THE TASTE NOW I THINK THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL DATA BUT WE NOW THAT THIS THING THE MOUTH TOSE YOU LISTENAMJES AGOUT MY COD FINGERS OF MY MOUTH AS W I SOUND LIKE AM I'SONLY IN MY MOUTH THIS THING IN THE FRONT OF OUR FACE WE USE IT FOR SPEAKING BUT IT IS THE FRONT OF OUR DIGESTIVE TRACT WE ARE ESSENTIALLY A SERIES OF TUBES AND THAT TUBE STARTS WITH YOUR MOUTH AND HEADS DOWN INTO YOUR STOMACH AND SO THAT YOU WOULD SENSE SO MUCH OF THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF THE STUFF THAT YOU MIGHT BRING INTO YOUR BODY OR THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO EXPELL AND NOT SWALLOW OR NOT INTERACT WITH BY BEING ABLE TO SMELL IT IS IT PUTRE DOES IT SMELL GOOD DOES IT TASTE GOOD IS IT SAFE IS IT SALTY IS IT SO SOUR THAT IT'S FORMENTED AND IS GON A POISON ME IS IT SO BITTER THAT IT COULD POISON ME IS IT SO SAVORY THAT YES I WANT MORE AND MORE OF THIS WELL THEN YOU'D WANT A TRIGGER DOPEIN THAT'S ALL STARTING IN THE MOUTH SO YOU AFE TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE EQUIPPED WITH THIS AMAZING CHEMICAL SENSING APPARATUS WE CALL YOUR MOUTH AND YOUR TONGUE AND THOSE LITTLE BUMPS ON YOUR TONGUE THAT THEY CALL THE PAPILLE THOSE ARE NOT YOUR TASTEBUTS SURROUNDING THOSE LITTLE PAPILLE LIKE LITTLE RIVERS ARE THESE LITLE DENSE AND INDENTATIONS AND WHAT DENSE AND INDENTATIONS DO IN A TISSUE IS THEY ALLOW MORE SURFACERY THEY ALLOW YOU TO PACK MORE RECEPTORS SO DOWN IN THOSE GROOVES ARE WHERE ALL THESE LITTLE NURNS AND THEIR AH AND THEIR LITTLE PROCESSES ARE WITH THESE LOW RECEPTORS FOR SWEET ALTY BIT ER UMAMI SOUR AND MAY BE FAT AS WELL SO IT'S THIS INCREDIBLE DEVICE THAT YOU'VE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH THAT YOU CAN USE TO INTERACT WITH VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND DECIDE WHETHER NOT YOU WANT TO BRING THEM IN OR NOT JUST AS YOU CAN LOSE THOSE OL FACTORY NURONS IF YOU HAPPEN TO GET HIT ON THE HEAD OR YOU HAVE SOME OTHER THING MAYBE IT AS AN INFECTION THAT CAUSE LOSS OF THOSE OLE FACTORY SENSERY NURONS YOU CAN ALSO LOSE TASTE RECEPTORS IN YOUR MOUTH IF YOU'VE EVER EATEN SOMETHING THAT'S TOO HOT NOT SPICY HOT BUT TOO HOT YOU BURN YOUR TONGUE YOU BURN RECEPTORS IT TAKES ABOUT A WEEK TO RECOVER THOSE RECEPTORS FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S A LOW BIT MORE QUICKLY BUT IF YOU BURN YOUR TONGUE BADLY BY INGESTING A SOUP THAT'S TOO HOT OR A BEVERAGE THAT'S TOO HOT YOU WILL GREATLY REDUCE YOUR SENSE OF TASTE FOR ESSENTIALLY ALL TASTE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE NURON SIT VERY SHALLOW BENEATH THE TONGUE SURFACE AND SO THAT IF YOU PUT SOMETHING TOO HOT ON THE YOU LITTLY JUST BURN THOSE NURONS AWAY LUCKILY THOSE NURONS ALSO CAN REPLENISH THEMSELVES THOSE NURONS ARE OF THE PARIFERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND LIKE ALL PEROFERALD SYSTEM NURANS THEY CAN REPLENISH OR REGENERATE SO IF YOU BURN YOUR MOUTH IN ABOUT A WEEK OR SO HOOFELY SOONER YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TASTE AGAIN IN FACT EVERYBODY'S ABILITY TO TASTE IS HIGHLY SUBJECT TO TRAINING YOU CAN REALLY ENHANCE YOUR ABILITY TO TASTE AND DIFFER AND TASTE THE DFFERENT COMPONENT PARTS OF DIFFERENT FOODS SIMPLY BY PAYING ATTENSION TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TASTE THIS IS AN AMAZING ASPECT OF THE TASTE SYSTEM I THINK MORE THAN ANY OTHER SYSTEM THE TASTE SYSTEM AND PERHAPS THE SMELL SYSTEM AS WELL CAN BE TRAINED SO THAT YOU CAN LEARN TO PICK OUT THE TONES IF YOU WILL OF DIFFERENT ICE CREAM OR DIFFERENT BEVERAGES IMSOMEBOY WHO  I DON'T DRINK MUCH ALCHAUL I OCCASIONALLY HAVE A DRINK OR SOMETHING BUT YOU KNOW WHILE AGO I GOT TO TASTE O BUNCH A DIFFERING UM WHITE TO KEELAS THESE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TIGULAS THAT ARE THEY'RE NOT BROWN THEIR WHITE AND I SORT OF ASSUME THAT ALTIKILLO WAS DISCUSTING THAT WAS MY ASSUMPTION BEFORE DOING THIS AND THE NI TASTED A COUPLE WHITE KILLAS AND RASOTOS ARE'T AREN'T TOO BAD I TASTE SE A FEW MORE D THE PRETTY SOON I COULD REALLY START TO DETECT THE NEW WANTS IND THE DIFFERENCE AND I HAVEN HAD A TKILL IN A LONG TIME NOW I SOR OF TEND TO NOT DRINK IT ALL THESE TASTE BUT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME LIKE A COUPLE OF DAYS I GOT VERY GOOD AT DETECTING WHICH THINGS I LIKED AND I COULD CERC TO PICK OUT TONES SO I'M NOT A WINE DRINKER BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE YOU KNOW OU HERE ABOUT OWYOU NO HAS FLORAL TONES OR BURY TONES OR CHOCOLATE TONES YE SOME OF THAT IS JUST KIND OF UM MEN YOU BASE AND KIND OF MARKETING BASE OM SILLINESS OM DESIGN TO GET YOU EXCITED ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO INGEST BUT SOME OF IT IS REAL AND FOR P PEOPLE THAT ARE SKILLED IN OM ASSESSING WINES OR ASSESSING FOODS NOT MUCH MORE OF AN EATER THAN A DRINKER YOU CAN REALLY START TO DEVELOP A SENSITIVE PALITE A NUANTSD PALITE THROUGH WHAT WE CALL TOP DOWN MECHANISMS THIS OLD FACTORY QUARTEC THAT TAKES THESE FIVE MAY BE THE SIX FAT RECEPTOR TO INFORMATION AND TRIES TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE WORLD AND WHAT WHAT ITS UTILITY IS AS IT GOOD IS IT BAD TO IOUN'T MORE OF IT OR LESS THAN IT THAT NEURAL CIRCUITRY IS UNLIKE OTHER NURL CIRCUITRY AND THAT IT SEEMS VERY IMENABLE TO BEHAVORAL PLASTICITY FOR WHATEVER REASON AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE REASONS MIGHT BE YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING SOMETIMES TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR TASTE LITERALLY CHEMICAL TASTE IS PROBABLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF OTHER PEOPLE HOW A FOO TASTES YOU IS PROBABLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN HOW IT TASTES THE SOMEBODY ELSE THE SAME PROBABLY CANNOT BE SAID OF SOMETHING LIKE VISION OR HEARING UNLESS YOUR SOMEBODY WHO HAS PERFECT PITCH OR YOUR COLLOR VISION IS DESRUPTED AM OR YOUROMANTIS SHRIMP CHANCES ARE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SAME OBJECT TWO PEOPLE ARE SEENG MORE OR LESS THE SAME OBJECT OR PERCEIVING IT IN A VERY SSIMILAR WAY THEIRE EXPERIMENTS THAT ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISH THAT NOW WE HAVE TASTE RECEPTERS AND TA LOT OF THOSE TASTES RECEPTORS THATR CHEMICAL STRUCTURES ARE KNOWN THEY COME WITH ON FANCY NAMES LIKE THE T AN OR WANER THE T ONE ARE TO WHICH WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE SWEET AND UMAMI RECEPTOR SO IT WHAT S INTERESTING IS THAT THIS UMAMI FLAVOR IS THE SAVORY FLAVOR RATHER THAT SENS BY UMAMMI RECEPTORS IS VERY CLOSE TO THE RECEPTER THAT DETECTS SWEET THINGS SIMILARLY BITTER IS SENSED BY A WHOLE OTHER SET OF RECEPTORS NOW THIS IT THERE'S A FUN NATURALLY OCCURRING EXPERIMENT THAT A WILL FOREVER CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU LOOK AT ANIMALS AND THE WAY CERTAINLY THAT I THINK ABOUT DOGS AND COSTELLO IN PARTICULAR CARNIVOROUS LARGE ANIMALS LIKE TIGERS AND SOME GRIZZLY BEARS FOR INSTANCE WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO DETECT SWEET THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE RECEPTERS FOR DETECTING SEET ON THEIR TONGUE BUT THEIRE CONCENTRATION OF UMAMMI RECEPTORS OF THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT SAVORY IS AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND TIMES THAT WHICH IT IS IN HUMANS IN OTHER WORDS IF I EAT A LITTLE PIECE OF STAKE OR COSTELLO EATS A LITTLE PIECE OF STAKE THAT STAKE PROBABLY TASTES MUCH MUCH MORE SAVORY THEN IT DOES TO ME SO DOGS AND TIGERS AND BEARS ET CETERA THEY ARE GOING TO TASTE SAVORY THINGS AND SMELL SAVORY THINGS WITH TEY MUCH HIGHER DEGREE OF SENSITIVITY BUT THEY CAN'T TASTE SWEET THINGS OTHER LARGE ANIMALS WHICH ARE MOSTLY URBIVORS LIKE THE PANDA BEAR FOR INSTANCE HARTABLY THAT THING IS EVEN A BEAR I GOT NOTHING AGAINST PANDAS I JUST THINK THAT THEY GET A LITLE BIT TOO MUCH OF THE LIMELIHTE FRANKLY AM SO NO VENDAT AGANS PANDA SAVE THE PANDAES  THEY REPLENISH ALL THE PANDAES BUT PANDOES IN ALL THEIR WHATEVER HAVE NO UMAMI RECEPTORS THEY CAN'T TASTE SAVORY BUT THEY HAVE GREATLY HEIGHTENED DENSITY OF SWEET RECEPTORS SO THERE THEY ARE EATING THESE WHATEVER BAMBOOZ ALL DAY OR OF NOT BAMBOOZLE BUT BAMBOOZ ALL DAY AND THEY CAN TASTE THINGS AND THAT ARE VERY SWEET WITH A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE OF INTENSITY AND IN GENERAL ANIMALS THAT ARE MORE GENTLE MORE UR BER THAT ARE URBIVORS SCUSE ME OR ANIMALS THAT HAVE THE PROPENSITY FOR AGGRESSION THAT'S WHERE YOU REALLY SEE THE DIVERGENCE OF THE UMMI RECEPTOR BECAUSE THE ASSOCIATE WITH MEAT AND A MENOACIDS AND WHERE YOU SEE THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE SWEET RECEPTORS FOR ANIMALS THAT EAT A LOT OF PLANTS AND FRUITS AND THEY PROBABLY TASTE VERY DIFFERENT TO THEM THAN THEY DO TO YOU AND MEAT AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT ANIMALS THAT EAT MEAT THAT EAT OTHER ORGANISMS CAN ACTUALLY EXTRACT MORE SAVORY EXPERIENCE FROM THAT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU ARE ARE T DU ASSOCIATE YOURSELF AS THE TIGER OR GRIZLYBEARER OR PANDA OR COMMINATION OF BOTH MOSTH PEOPLE ARE OMNIVORS HOWEVER YOU MAY FIND IT INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE THAT FOR INSTANCE EAT A PURE CARNIVORE TYPE DIET OR AQUITO DIET WHERE THEY ARE INGESTING A LOT OF MEATS SO THEREFORE ARE SENSING A LOT OF UMAMI FLAVORS AND I REALIZE NOT EVERYONE WHOSE QUITO EATS MEAT BUT THOSE WHO DO THAT WILL DEVELOP A MORE SENSITIVE PALITE AND LIKELY THERE ARE SOME DATA ALTHOUGH EARLY DATA CRAVING FOR UMAMI LIKE FOODS WHEREAS PEOPLE THAT EAT A MORE PLANTBASE DIET ARE LIKELY DEVELOPING A HEIGHTEN SENSITIVITY AND DESIRE FOR AND MAY BE VEN DOPENING RESPONSE TO SUGARS AND PLANT BASE FOODS NOW THIS IS MI PARTIAL ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THE CAN OF ONLINE BATTLE THAT SEEMS TO EXIST BETWEEN PLANT BASE VERSES ANIMAL BASE OM PURELY PLANTBAS AR PURELY ANIMAL BASE DIETS THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE OMNIVORS BUT ITS KIND OF INTERESTING TO THINK THAT THE SYSTEMS OR PLASTIC SUCH THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT MORE MEAT IF THEY EAT MORE MEAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT MORE PLANTS IF THEY EAT ENOUGH PLANTS FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN SOME OF THE CHASM THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS NOW THIS IS NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE ETHICAL OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF DIFFERNTHINGS EVEY ONE A GET INTO THAT BECAUSE THE MET PEOPLE SAY THAT THE PLANT BASE DIETS HAVE AS MUCH THE NEGATIVE IMPACT AS THE PLANT PEOPLE SAY THAT THE MEAT BASE DITSOR THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DISCUSSION WHEN TALKING ABOUT HERE IS FOOD CRAVING AND FOOD SEEKING AND ONE'S ABILITY TO DETECT THESE UMAMMI SAVORY FLAVORS IS GOING TO BE ENHANCED BY INGESTING MORE MEAT AND LESS ACTIVATION OF THE SWEET RECEPTORS SO IN OTHER WORDS THE MORE IT MEAT YOU EAT THE MORE YOU CAN BECOME LIKE A TIGER SO TO SPEAK AND THE MORE THAT YOU AVOID THE ESE UMAMI FLAVORS AND MEATS AND THE MORE THAT YOU WOULD EAT PLANTBASE FOODS AND IMPARTICULAR SWEET FOODS THE MORE YOU WILL LIKELY SUPPRESS THAT UMAMI S TEM AND THAT YOU WILL HAVE A HEIGHTENED A DESIRE FOR APPETITE FOR AND SENSING OF SWEET FOODS OR FOODS THAT CONTAIN SUGARS WHAT AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU IS GOING TO SEEM CRAZY BUT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING WITH RESPECT TO TASTE AND TASTE RECEPTORS REMEMBER EVEN THOUGH WE CAN ENJOY FOOD AND WE CAN INVOLVE OUR SENSE OF WHAT'S TASTY OR NOT TASTY DEPENDING ON LIFE DECISIONS ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES ET CETERA THE TASTE SYSTEM JUST LIKE THE OLD FACTORY SYSTEM IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM WAS LAY DOWN FOR THE PURPOS OF MOVING TOWARDS THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR US AND MOVING AWAY FROM THINGS THAT ARE BAD FOR US THAT'S THE KIND OF CORE FUNCTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WELL TASTE RECEPTORS ARE NOT JUST EXPRESSED ON THE TONGUE THEY ARE EXPRESSED IN OTHER CELLS AND OTHER TISSUES AS WELL SOME OF YOU MAY BE ABLE TO IMAGINE FOODS THAT ARE SO DELICIOUS TO YOU THAT THEY MAKE YOUR ENTIRE BODY FEEL GOOD OR FOODS THAT ARE SO HORRIFICALLY AWFUL TO THINK ABOUT LET ALONE TASTE THAT THEY CREATE A WHOLE BODY SHUDDERING OR KIND OF REPELLENT TYPE RESPONSE WHERE YOU JUST EITHER CRINGE OR TURN YOUR FACE AWAY EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT FOOD THA SORT OF HOW I FEEL ABOUT PUNGENT GORGANS OLACHEES IF YOU LIKE ORGANZOLOGIES I DON'T JUDGE YOU I JUST THAT'S AN INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCE I HAPPEN TO LOVE CERTAIN FOODS I DO LIKE SAVORY FOODS VERY MUCH I WHEN I THINK ABOUT THEM THEY JUST THEY MAKE ME FEEL GOOD AND I OFTENTIMES NOT EVEN ASSOCIATING WITH THE TASTE OF THOSE FOODS ITS FEELS ALMOST LIKE A VICERAL THING WHAT TURNS OUT THAT SOME OF THE TASTES RECEPTORS EXTEND BEYOND THE TONGUE THAT THEY ACTUALLY CAN EXTEND INTO PORTIONS OF THE GOT AND DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND IF THAT'S NOT STRANGE ENOUGH TURNS OUT THAT SOME OF THE TASTES RECEPTORS ARE ACTUALLY EXPRESSED ON THE OVERIES AND THE TESTIES SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE GONADS THE VERY CELLS AND TISSUES AND ORGANS IN OUR BODY THAT MAKE UP THE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS ARE EXPRESSING TASTE RECEPTORS CAS HOW DO WE INTERPRETHIS DOES THIS MEAN THAT WHEN YOU EAT SOMETHING THAT'S VERY SAVORY OR A VERY SWEET FOR INCANCE THAT ITS TRIGGERING ACTIVATION OF THE OVERIES OR OF THE TESTIES WELL IT'S POSSIBLE NOW HOW THOSE MOLECULES THOSE CHEMICAL MOLECULES WOULD ACTUALLY GET THERE IS INT CLEAR THE DIGESTIVE TRACK DOES NOT RUN DIRECTLY TO THE TESTIES ARE TO THE OVERIES BUT NONE THE LESS WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT CHEMICAL SENSING OF THE VERY THINGS THAT WE DETECT ON OUR TONGUE N THAT WE CALL TASTE IN QUOTES IN FOOD IS ALSO EVOKING CELLULAR RESPONSES WITHIN THE REPRODUCTIVE GONADS NOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS UNDER LIES THE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION THAT WE HAVE WITH CERTAIN FOODS ISN'T CLEAR BUT I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT THE OBVIOUS WHICH IS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SENSUAL NATURE OF PARTICULAR FOODS AND SENSUALITY GENERALLY AND THE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN COVERED IN MANY MOVIES THEREARE ENTIRE MOVIES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEME FOR INSTANCE CHOCOLATE AND LOVE AND REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIORS OR A CERTAIN FEST OF MEAT AND THEIR WONDERFUL TASTE AND THE KIND OF SENSUALITY AROUND FEASE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOODS BUT IN GENERAL IT'S THE SWEET AND THE SAVORY RARELY IS IT THE SOUR OR THE BITTER THE SALTY OR THE FAT AND NOT SURPRISINGLY PERHAPS IT IS THE TEA TWO OURS AND THE TEA ONE ARS THE THE RECEPTORS THAT AR ASSOCIATED WITH THE SWEET AND WITH THE UMAMI THE SAVORY FLAVORS THAT ARE EXPRESSED NOT JUST ON THE TONGUE AND IN PORTIONS OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT BUT ON THE GONADS THEMSELVES SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN DOES THIS MEAN THAT EATING CERTAIN FOODS CAN STIMULATE THE GONADS MAYBE THERE IS NO DATA THAT IMMEDIATELY SUPPORT THAT RIGHT NOW BUT THIS IS AN EMERGING AREA IF YOU LIKE TO READ MORE ABOUT THIS THERE IS A GREAT REVIEW ENTITLED TASTE PERCEPTION FROM THE TONGUE TO THE TESTIES ALTHOUGH THEY DO ALSO TALK ABOUT A THE OVERIES WHY THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE THAT IN THE TITLE AS I THINK REFLECTION OF THE OR BIUS OF THE AUTHOR THE AUTHOR A IN NOT INCIDENTALLY IS A FANG LEE LAST LASTING EL E A IS A VERY INTERESTING PAPER ON PUBLISHED IN MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION AH YOU CAN FIND IT EASILY ON LINE DOWN LOTABLE ALSO PROVIDE A LINK TO IT I JUST THINK IT'S FASCINATING THAT THESE TASTE RECEPTORS ARE EXPRESSED IN OTHER TISSUES AND I SHOULD MENTION THA THERE EXPRESSED IN TISSUES OF OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY IS WELL INCLUDING THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM BUT THE RICHEST AGGREGATION OR CONCENTRATION OF THESE RECEPTORVES FROM MAMIAN SWEET OF COURSES ON THE TONGUE BUT ALSO ON THE GONADS AND I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO THE POSSIBLE BRIDGE BETWEEN WHAT WE THINK OF AS A A SENSORY OR SENSUAL EXPERIENCE OF FOOD AND THE DEEPER KIND OF VICERAL SENSE WITHIN THE GUT AND MAKE EVEN WITHIN THE GONADS AS WELL OF SOMETHING THAT WE FIND EXTREMELY PLEASURABLE OR EVEN APPETITIVE THAT WE WANT TA MOVE TOWARD IT WE ARE ACTING IN A RETURN TO THAT GENERAL THEME IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT TOUCH SENSATION SOME PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE WHEN THEY TOUCH CERTAIN SURFACES LIKE ON FURS OR OR SHEEP SKINS OR VELVET OR SOFT SMOOTH SURFACES IT FEELS GOOD ELSEWHERE IN THEIR BODY NOT JUST AT THE POINT OF CONTACT WITH THAT SURFACE AND SIMILARLY IF THERE'S THE HAWBOUT THIS ONE THE SCREECH OF CHALK ON A CHALKBOARD IT'S IT'S A SOUND BUT HAS A VERY STRONG VICERAL COMPONENT OR SAND PAPER LIKE F INGERS FINGER NAILS ON A CHALK BOARD NOT THE SOUND BUT THE FEELING RIGHT EXACTLY SO ARE' WHOLE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS TUNE EITHER BE DRAWN TOWARD A PETITIVE OR REPELLED BY AVERSIVE BEHAVIORS WHY SO THEREIS THIS PUSHPOLE THAT EXISTS AND WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IN TERMS OF THESE RECEPTORS ON THE TONGUE THAT ARE ALSO EXPRESSED ON THE GONADS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT LEAST IN THIS CASE SEEMS TO BE AND A PETITIVE THING A DESIRE TO MOVE TOWARD CERTAIN FOODS AND MAY BEVEN THE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE FOODS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF FOOD AND A CHEMICAL REACTION IN COOKING CALLED THE MAARD REACTION SOME OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE MAARD REACTION IT SPELLED M A I L L A R D THE D IS SILENT SO DON'T CALL IT THE MALARD REACTION AND IT'S NOT THE MALARD REACTION IT IS THE MAAR REACTION AND THE MAAR REACTION IS A REACTION THAT FOR THE EFPHYSIONATOS IS A NON ENSEMATIC BROWNING THE OTHER FORM OF NON ENSEMATIC BROWNING IS CARMALIZATION ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU HEAR CARAMEL CARMEL HN IT'S CHARAMEL YOU THINK SWEET AND INDEED CARAMCARAMALIZATION IS A SUGAR SUGAR CHEMICAL INTERACTION THAT LEADS TO A KIND OF NICELY TOASTED NOT BURNT BUT NICELY TOASTED SWEET TASTE WHEREAS THE MAARD REACTION IS THAT REALLY SAVORY REACTION THAT OCCURS WHEN YOU HAVE A SUGAR A MENOACID REACTION REMEMBER WE HAVE NURONS AND ARE GUT BUT ALSO NURONS IN OUR TONGUE AND NURONS DEEP IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE COMCARING THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR TO SAVORY OKH AND THE MAARD REACTION IS VERY INTERESTING UF FOR YOU A CHEMIS OUT THERE THIS IE CAN BE WAY TO ELEMENTARY AND FOR YOU NON CHEMISTITS PROBABEY YOU BE A LITTLE BIT OF A REACH BUT JUST BAR WITH ME ALL THESE CHEMICALS THAT WE SENSE HAVE A DIFFERENT STRUCTURES LIKE HYDROGENS AND OXYGENS AND ALL THE HYDE GROUPS AND ALL THESE THINGS AND BASELY THE MAARD REACTION INVOLVES WHAT'S CALLED A FREE ALBAHIDE IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE CHEMISTRY DON'T WORRY ABOUT ITS BASICALLY GOT A A GROUP THERE THAT CONOF SITS OPEN THAT ALLOWS IT TO INTERACT WITH OTHER THINGS AND ACTUALLY THROUGH THE USE OF HEAT AND O THE PROCES THAT WE CALLED BRAZING SHALL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT YOU CREATE A WHAT'S CALL THE KEYTONE GROUP NOW MOST YOULE NOW HAVE HEARD A KETONES TO THE THING ABOUT THE KEYDOGENIC DIET BUT A KEYTONE GROUP IS ACTUALLY A CHEMICAL COMPOUND THAT CAN BE USED FOR ENERGY NHOT'S WHAT YOU WILL SAY YOU CAN USE KEYTONES FOR ENERGY BUT IF YOU'VE EVER ACTUALLY ENCOUNTERED KEYTONES IF YOU U FOR INSTANCE GET LIQUID KEYTONES A KEYTONE ASTOR AND YOU SMELL IT WHAT IS IT SMELL LIKE IT SMELLS A LITTLE BIT LIKE AN ALCOHOL BUT IT HAS A KIND OF SAVORY TASTE EVEN WHEN YOU SMELL IT OK THERE R OTHER SMELLS THAT HAVE THESE TASTE TOO BUT FOR THE MAARD REACTION WHICH COULD BE CREATED FOR INSTANCE LIK IF YOU TOOK UP PIECE OF MEAT OR IF YOU'RE NOT A MEDIATOR IF YOU TOOK TOMATOES AND YOU COOK THEM IN A PAN AND YOU COOKED IT NICE AND SLOW TILL IT SIMMERED AND ALMOST STARTED TO BROWN AND BURNALO BUT USUALLY IF I DO IT IT BURNS I'M NOT A GOOD COOK IS CALLSTILLOPOINTS OUT A LOT BUT IT GETS THAT LIKE ALMOST TANGI VERY UMAMI LIKE FLAVOR AND SOMETIMES IT WILL EVE IN STICK TO THE PAN IF YOU SCRAPE IT OFF IT ACTUALLY YOU CAN TASTE IT IN YOUR MOUTH AS YOUR COOKING IT THAT'S THE MAYARD REACTION THAT'S THAT FREE ALTAHIDE GROUP AND THAT'S THE PRODUCTION OF OF A KEYTONE GROUP WHEN YOU SMELL KEYTONES IT SMELLS VERY MUCH LIKE THAT  CAN I SOME PEOPLE TOK ABOUT THE KEYTONES I WILL PRODUCE LIKE FRUITY BREATH AND THAT'S TRUE IF PEOPLE ARE REALLY FAR INTO QITOSIS THEIR BREATH HAS A KIND OF FRUITY ODOR THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT THING SO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SMELL AND TASTE IS A VERY VERY CLOSE ONE AND THIS IS WHY WHEN PEOPLE DRINK WINE THEY OFTEN WILL INHALE AND THEN SIP SOME OF THAT AS JUST KIND OF LIKE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE FRANKLY I MAKE A BIG DEAL OF IT BUT THEY CAN SENSE THINGS WITH THEIR MOUTH THE COMMINATION OF ODOR RECEPTORS BEING ACTIVATED IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND TASTE RECEPTORS IN THE MOUTH BEING ACTIVATED IN A PARTICULAR WAY TRIGGERS THE ACTIVATION OF MULTIBLE BRAIN AREAS THEY ARE SOCIATED WITH TASTE AND CIRCUITRY WITHIN THE BODY THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THE BEHAVIORS THAT RELATE TO THAT TASTE LIKE LEANING TOWARD IT OR LEANING AWAY FROM IT DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT S A PEDITIVE OR AVERSIVE SO THAT THEYARDREACTIONS OF VERY INTERESTING A REACTION INVOLVING THIS SUGAR AMENO ACID THING BUT REALLY ITS WHAT ITS DOING IS HEATING UP FOOD SUCH THAT THE EMENO ACIDS ARE MORE A VAILABLE LITERALLY IN THEIR CHEMICAL FORM FOR DETECTION BY THE NORANS THIS IS A PHENOMENON THAT OCCURS IN OTHER DOMAINS OF THE TASTE SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE A LOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS IS THAT MANUFACTURES HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO TRIGGER MORE DOPAMIN RESPONSE BY INGESTION OF THESE SUGARY FOODS AND CREATED TEXTURES AND CREATED SENTULLY DESIGN OF FOODS FOR TWO PURPOSES I'M NOT OUT TO THA COMPLETELY DEMINIZED PROCESS FOODS HID TO THAT IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT PROCESS FOODS ARE REALLY DESIGNED TO TAKE FOODS THAT ORDINARILY WOULD SPOIL THAT WOULD HAVE A SHELF LIFE AND EXTEND THEIR SHELF LIFE TO TURN FOODS WHICH ARE NOT A COMMODITY INTO A COMMODITY SOMETHING CON BE STORED AND USED ASSENTIALLY AS A AM AS A TRATABLE PURCHASABLE SELLABLE RESOURCE IN DOING THAT THEY CHANGE THEY'VE ALSO DECIDE TO CHANGE THE TEXTURE SO THAT YOU WANT TO CHEW MORE OF THEM LIKE I HAVE THIS THING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR THOSE AF TRISCIT CRACKERS HOW WHY ARE THOSE THINGS SO GET ITS PY THE TEXTURE NGOL THOSE LAYERS THARE JUST KIND OF PERFECTLY SALTY HAVEN'T HAVE ONE  A LONG TIME SOI BET IF I HAD WHEN NOW IT WOULDN'T TASTE AS GOOD AS I'M IMAGINING IT BUT THOSE COMMINATIONS OF TEXTURE SMELL AND TASTE ARE WHAT COMBINED TO ACTIVATE THESE DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS THAT MAKE YOU REALLY WANT A DESIRE SOMETHING AND THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE FOODS PROCESS FOODS IN PARTICULAR AR PHENOMENALLY GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHAT DRIVES THE DOPENING SYSTEM AND MAKES YOU WANT MORE OF THESE THINGS EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY TASTE AND OR BECAUSE THE WAY THEY TRIGGER NARANS AND YOU'R GOT THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH T ASTE THAT SIMPLY MAKE YOU DESIRE MORE F THE FOOD IN OTHER WORDS MANY OF THE FOODS THAT ARE PROCESS FOODS MAKE YOU DESIRE MORE OF THEM THE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EAT ONE CHIP KIND OF THING NOT BECAUSE THEY TASTE GOOD BUT BECAUSE IN YOUR GUT THEIR ACTIVATING THE NURONS THAT ACTIVEA DOPAMINE WHICH MAKE YOU SEEK MORE OF THOSE FOODS INDEPENDENT OF BLOOD SUGAR OR ANYTHING ELSE SO YOU MAY ACTUALLY BE EATING MORE PERTULAR FOODS NOT BECAUSE THEY TASTE GOOD BUT BECAUSE THEY FEEL GOOD ON YOUR TONGUE AND MOUTH AND BECAUSE THE NURONS IN YOUR GUT WHICH ARE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF CONSCIOUS TASTE ARE TRIGGERING IN THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE WHICH IS A MOLECULE THAT MAKES YOU SEEK MORE OF AND DO MORE OF ANYTHING THAT LED TO THE INGESTION OF THAT FOOD THERE'S A FUN EXPERIMENT THAT YOU CAN DO WHICH IS TO COMPLETELY INVERT YOUR SENSE OF SWEET AND SOUR THERE'S ACTULA WAY TO DO THIS READILY WHEN I WAS A POSTSTOCK I USED TO HAVE A JOURNAL CLUB AT MY HOUSE PEOPLE COME OVER IN THE EVENING ONCE A MONTH AND WE WOULD READ A PAPER TYPICALLY THE WEARDIS PAPER WE COULD FIND AND WE WOULD EAT FOOD AND HANG OUT AET NURD DID AND DO FOR FUN SO THAT'S WAT WE DID AND ONE TIME SOME ONE BROUGHT WHAT'S CALLED MIRACLE BERRY AND SO THIS IS IN SOME PSYCHADELIC PLANT MEDICINE THING MIRACLE BERRY YOU CAN O PURCHASE ON LINE ITS RELATIVELY IN EXPENSIVE IT ACTUALLY CAUSES A CHANGE IN THE CONFIGURATION OF TASTE RECEPTORS SUCH THAT WHEN YOU EAT SOMETHING SOUR IT TASTE SWEET AND SO WHAT'S REALLY WILD AS YOU INJUST MIRACLE BERRY AND THEND YOU BITE INTO A LEMON MAYBEVEN THE LEMON PEEL AND IT TASTES A SWEET IS A PEACH AND THIS EFFECT LAST SEVERAL HOURS ON DEFANALLY THE UNCHECKANY WARNINGS I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF WARNINGS THE MIRACLE BERRY CARRIES BUT I'M SURE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING YOUYOU CAN IMAGINE THEIR NUMBER PAPERS ON MIRACLE BERRY AR OR MIRACLE FRUIT IT'S CALLED O BUT IT CHANGES YOUR PERCEPTION OF SOUR AT A PERCEPTIAL LEVEL BUT IT DOES THAT BY CHANGING THE ACTIVITY THE RECEPTORS IN THE MOUTH AND TONGUE NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT AS A PRINCIPLE AND IT'S UNDERSCORED BY EXPERIMENTS THAT BEEN DONE BY FOR INSTANCE CHARLES ZOOKERS LAB AT COLUMBA UNIVERSITY WHERE THEY'VE SUCH A GENETICALLY ENGINEER ANIMALS SUCH THAT THE BITTER RECEPTOR IS SWAPPED WITH THE SWEET RECEPTOR OR THE SWEET RECEPTOR RI SWAPPET WITH THE BITTER RECEPTOR AND WHAT THEY SHOW IS THAT THE ACTUAL FOOD THE EXPERIENCE ON THE TONGUE DRIVES DIFFERENT PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN HERE'S WHAT THEY DID THEY ESSENTIALLY TOOK MICE AND SWAPPED OUT THE SWEET RECEPTOR AND PUT IN A BITTER RECEPTOR AND THEN WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT WHEREAS NORMALLY MICE WOULD ACTIVELY SEEK OUT AND EVEN WORK FOR SUGAR WATER SUGROS THEY REALLY LIKE THAT IF THEY REPLACE THE SWEET RECEPTOR WITH THE BITTER RECEPTOR THE MICE WOULD AVOID SUGAR WATER NEIR VERSE WAS ALSO TRUE THAT MICE WOULD DRINK A BITTER SOLUTION AVIDLY THEY LIKED A BITTER SOLUTION IF THEY SWAPPED OUT THE BITTER RECEPTOR FOR SWEET RECEPTER WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT OUR ENTIRE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT WE TASTE IS DEPENDENT ON HOW WE EXPERIENCE THAT TASTED THE LEVEL OF THE TONGUE AND SO A YEUR HOPEFULLY KNOCK IN A DO GENETIC ENGINEERING OF YOUR TASTE RECEPTORS BUT IF YOU LIKE TO DO THIS SORT OF EXPERIMENT YOU ACTUALLY CAN DO IT VERY EASILY USING MIRACAL FRUIT THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW MUCH TENJEST ET CETERA ANY SAFETY CONCERNS ARE USUALLY ON THE PACKAGEAN ON SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND AND THERE'S A LOT OF SCIENCE TO SUPPORT HOW THIS WORKS ITS KIND OF FUN EXPERIMENT THAT ANY ONE CAN DO AND WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE YOUR PERCEPTION OF ANY FOOD THAT YOUR CUSTOM TO EATING IN FACT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH SWEET WERE THE SENSE OF SWEETNESS IS CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR EXPERIENCE OF A FOOD EVEN IF YOU DON'T THINK OF AS A SWEET FOOD THROUGH THIS MIRACLE FRUIT EXPERIMENT YOU COULD TAKE MIRACALE FRUIT YOU CULTE A SLICE OF PEPERRONI PITZA OR CHISPITZA WHICH PERHAPS NORMALLY TO YOU WOULD TASTE JUST LIKE PITZA AND YOU'LL NOTICE IT TASTES VERY DIFFERENT WHAT YOU ARE DETECTING IS HOW MUCH THE SENSE OF SWEET WAS CONTRIBUTING TO THAT PARTICULAR FLAVOR NOW I'D LIKE TO RETURN TO FARIMONS SO MENTIONED EARLIER TRUE FERIMONAL EFFECTS ARE WELL ESTABLISHED IN ANIMALS AND ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE FARIMON EFFECTS HATS EVER BEEN DESCRIBED IS ONE THAT ACTIA HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE ON THI SPODCAS BUT 'LL MENTION AGAIN JUST BRIEFLY WHICH IS THE COOLAGE EFFECT THE COLEGE EFFECT IS THE EFFECT OF A MALE OF A GIVEN SPECIES IN MOST CASES IT TENDED TO BE A RODENT OR A ROOSTER MATING AND AT SOME POINT REACHING EXHAUSTION OR THE INABILITY TO MATE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY JUST SIMPLY COULDN'T FOR WHATEVER REASON THE COOLEGE EFFECT HESTABLISHES THAT IF YOU SWAP OUT THE HEN WITH A NEW HEN OR THE FEMALE RAT OR MOUSE WITH A NEW ONE THEN THE RAT OR THE ROOSTER SPONTANEOUSLY REGAINS THEIR ABILITY TO MATE SOMEHOW THEIR VIGOR IS RETURNED THE REFRACTORY PERIOD AFTER MADING THAT NORMALLY OCCURS IS ABOLISHED AND THEY CAN MATE AGAIN TURNS OUT THAT THE COOLEGE EFFECT RUNS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TOO I DO NOT KNOW THIS BUT I RECENTLY LEARNED OF A STUDY IT WAS ACTUALLY DONE IN HAMPSTERS NOT IN IN MICE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT FEMALES ALSO WILL FEMALE RODENTS WILL MATE TO EXHAUSTION AND AT SOME POINT THAT SOME POINT SCUSE ME THEY WILL REFUSE TO MATE ANY LONGER UNLESS YOU SWAP IN A NEW MALE AND THEND BECAUSE MATING AND RODENTS INVOLVES THE FEMALE BEING RECEPTIVE THERE CERTAIN NUMBER OF BEHAVIORS THAT MEAN THAT SHE THAT TELL YOU THAT SHE'S WILLING AND WANTING TO MATE SO CALL LORDOSIS REFLECTS THEN IF THERE'S A NEW MALE SHE WILL SPONTANEOUSLY REGAIN THE LORDOSIS REFLEC AND THE DESIRE TO MATE AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS HO DO WE KNOW IT'S A FERMONAL EFFECT WELL THIS RECOVERY OF THE DESIRE AND ABILITY TO MATE BOTH IN MALES AND IN FEMALES CAN BE EVOKED COMPLETELY BY THE ODOR OF A NEW MALE OR FEMALE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE THE PRESENTATION OF THE ACTUAL ANIMAL ANTHAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NOT SOME VISUAL INTERACTION OR SOME OTHER INTERACTION IT'S A FARMONAL INTERACTION NOW AS I MENTIONE EARLIER FERMONAL EFFECTS HUMENS HAVE BEEN DEBATED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WE ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE A VESTIDIAL MEANING A KIND OF SHRUNKEN DOWN A MINIATURE ACCESSORIAL EFFACTORY BULB CALLED JACOBSON'S ORGAN WERE THE VOMERONAZSAL ORGAN SOME PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE THAT JACOBSON'S ORGAN EXTHIS SOME PEOPLE DO THERE IS ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE FOR IT IN SOME CADAVERS IT SITS NOT VERY HIGH UP IN THE BRAIN OR WHERE EURAL FACTORY BULB IS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE NASAL PASSAGES SO THEREIS LI LITTLE DENSE AS YOU GO UP THROUGH NASAL PASSAGES AND THERE IS EVIDENCE OF SOMETHING THATS VOMERONAZSAL LIKE VOMER NAZAL IS THE FERMONAL ORGAN THEY CALLED JACOBSN'S ORGAN IF ITS PRESENT IN HUMANS KIND OF A TALKED IN TO SOME OF THE DIVITS IN THE NASAL PASSAGE EVEN IF THAT ORGAN JACOBSON'S ORGAN ISN'T THERE OR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHEMICAL SIGNALING BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THERE IS CHEMICAL SIGNALING BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS SO MENTION EARLIER THE EFFECT OF TEARS IN SUPPRESSING THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THERE INVOLVED IN SEXTUAL DESIRE AND TESTOSTRONE OF MALES THAT'S A CONCRETE RESULT ITS A VERY GOOD RESULT PUBLISHED BY AN EXCELLENT GROUP WITH NO PRE EXISTING BYIS GOING IN THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY FOUND THERRE IS ALSO EVIDENCE BOTH FOR AND AGAINST CHEMICAL SIGNALING BETWEEN FEMALES IN TERMS OF SYNCHRINIZATION OF MENSTRUAL CYCLES NOW THE ORIGINAL PAPER ON THIS WAS PUBLISHED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES BY MCLINTOCH AND IT ESSENTIALLY SAID THAT WHEN WOMEN LIVE TOGETHER IN GROUP POUSING DORMITORIES IN SIMILAR THAT THEIRE MENSTRUAL CYCLES WER SYNCHRONIZE IN THAT WAS DUE TO WHAT WAS HYPOTHESIZED TO BE FERMONAL EFFECTS OVER THE YEARS THAT STUDY HAS BEN CHALLENGED MANY MANY TIMES THE MORE RECENT DATA POINT TO THE IDEA THAT THERE IS CHEMICAL CHEMICAL SIGNALING BETWEEN WOMEN IN WAYS THAT IMPACT THE TIMING OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE BUT THAT DEPENDING ON WEATHER NOT SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE IN THE OVULATION PHASE THE OBULATORY PHASE OF THAT CYCLE OR WHETHER NOT THEY ARE IN THE FALICULAR PHASE THE PHASE WHEN THE PHOLICAL IS MATURING BEFORE THE EGG ACTUALLY A OVULATES SO TO TWO SEPARATE PHASES OF THE MENSTER OF THE TWENTY ADAY MENSTRUAL CYCLE WILL EITHER LENGTHEN OR SHORTEN THE MENSTRUAL CYCL OF THE PERSON THAT SMELLS THOSE WOMEN TRANSLATE INTO ENGLISH WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY IT SEEMS THAT SOMETHING MAY BE PHEIRMONES BUT MAY BE SOME OTHER CHEMICAL THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF FERMONES IS BEING CONVEYED BETWEEN WOMEN THAT ARE HOUSE TOGETHER OR SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER TO SHIFT THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY SYNCHRONACS S IL FOR INSTANCE IF ONE WOMAN IS IN THE FELICULAR PHAS OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IT MIGHT SHORTEN OR DELAY OVULATION HAT EXCUSE ME IT MIGHT ACCELERATE OVULATION IN ANOTHER WOMAN WHEREAS IF SOMEBODY IS IN THE OVULATORY PHASE OF THEIR CYCLE IT MIGHT LENGTHEN THE MENSTRUAL CYCL OUT SO THAT THEY THE WOMEN WHO SMELLS THAT PERSONS SENT OR WHO SMELLS HER SWEAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE ORIGIN OF THE CHEMICAL WOULD OVULATE LATER SO ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY IS THAT CHEMICAL CHEMICAL SIGNALING IS HAPPENING FROM FEMALES TO MALES THROUGH TEARS WE KNOW THAT IS THAT A FAIRMONAL EFFECT WELL BY THE STRICT DEFINITION OF AFFARMON A MOLECULE THAT'S RELEASE FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT IMPACTS THE BIOLOGY OF ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL YES BUT IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING WHAT THE FARMON IS IN TEARS THAT STILL UNKNOWN IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE CHEMICAL COMPOUND IS SO WE RELUCTANT AS SCIENTIST TO CALL IT A TRUE FAIRMONAL EFFECT THE MINSTRUAL CYCLE AND THE SINCURINSATION THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE EFFECT SEEMS TO HOLD UP UNDER SOME CONDITIONS BUT IN SOME CASES THERE'S A KIND OF CLASH OF MENSTRUAL CYCLES THAT'S CREATED BY CHEMICALS THAT ARE EMITTED FROM ONE FEMALE TO ANOTHER SO THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS INHUMANS FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE CAN RECOGNIZE THE T SHIRT OF THEIR MATE IF YOU GIVE THIS EXPEREMENTS BEEN DONE MANY TIMES I KNOW IT'S BEEN CHALLENGE NUMBER OF TIMES BUT THE DATE ARE PRETTY GOOD BY NOW THAT IF YOU OFFER O YOU TAKE A COLLECTION OF OF WOMEN A WHO ARE IN STABLE RELATIONSHIPS TO SOMEBODY YOU OFFER THEM THE SMELL OF A HUNDRED DIFFERENT SHIRTS AND THEY CAN VERY READILY PICK OUT THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS SENT GAN THAT'S PURAL FACTION THAT'S NOT FARMONAL BUT NONE THE LESS IS A REMARKABLE DEGREE OF DISCRIMINATION A FACTORY DISCRIMINATION YOU CAN DILUTE THEIR PARTNER SENT DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE THEY THEMSELVES CAN'T CONSCIOUSLY DETECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SWEAT OR THE T SHIRT OF HUNDRED IVEN TSHIRTS OR SO THE MIG SAT I DON'T REALLY SMELL THE DIFFERENCE BUT I THINK ITS THIS ONE YET THIS ONE BELONGS TO THE PERSON THAT IAVE BEEN WITH AND THEY ARE MUCH GREATER THAN CHANCE AT DETECTING THE T SHIRTER OR IDENTIFIND THE T SHIRT CORRECTLY SO THERE'S NO QUESTION REALLY THAT THERE IS CHEMICAL CHEMICAL SIGNALING BETWEEN HUMANS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER NOT ITS TRULY FAIRMONAL IN BASIS NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THE LOT THE EXAMPLES I GAVE ASIDE FROM THE ONE OF TEARS IS WOMEN DETECTING THE SENSE OF MEN OR OF OTHER WOMEN AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PAPERS O THE BEST ONE I THINK THAT I COULD FIND AM IS PUBLISHED IN PHYSIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR IND TWO THOUSAND IDES A REVIEW ENTITLED SEX DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTIVE HORMONE INFLUENCES ON HUMAN ODOR PERCEPTION BY DODDY DEOT WHY AND CAMERAN I ENCURGE YOU TO CHECK OUT THIS REVIEW IT'S AVAILABLE FREE AS A DOWN LA WILL PRIDE PROVIDE A LINK TO IT YOUAN GET THE FULL P D F IF YOU WANT BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT WOMEN ARE BETTER AT DETECTING ODORS IN THESE ODOR DISCR RMINATION TASS THEN ARE MEN AND YES THAT IT DOES VARY ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND YES THEY ALSO LOOKED AT PEOPLE WHO HAD RECEIVED GONADEC TO ME THAT HAVE THEIR OVERIES REMOVED A NUMBER DIFFERENT IMPORTANT CONTROLS NONE OF THIS SURPRISES ME NONE OF THIS SHOULD SURPRISE YOU IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HORMONES HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON ENLARGE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS IN AR BIOLOGY AND THAT SMELL AND TASTE AND THE ABILITY OF SENSE THE CHEMICAL STATES OF OTHERS EITHER CONSCIOUSLY AR SUBCONSCIOUSLY HAVE A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON WHETHER OR NOT WE MIGHT WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEM WHETHER NOT THIS AS SOMEBODY THAT WE'RE PARBONDED WITH WHETHER NOT THIS AS SOMEBODY THAT WE JUST MET AND A DON'T TRUST YET THINGS OF THIS SORT AND GIVEN WHATS AT STAKE IN TERMS OF REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY NOT JUST OFFSPRING BUT GIVEN THEY A POSSIBILITY OF TRANSMISSION OF DISEASES ET CETERA OF YOU KNOW THE RISTS OF OF CHILD BIRTH ET CETERA IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE THAT MUCH OF OUR BIOLOGY IS WIRED TOWARD DETECTING IN SENSING WHETHER NOT THINGS AND PEOPLE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD APPROACH OR AVOID WHETHER OR NOT REPRODUCTION WITH THAT PERSON IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE OR SUPPRESSION OF THE REPRODUCTIVE RESPONSE AS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE RIGHT AS IN THE CASE WITH THE TEERS SO I THINK THESE ARE FASCINATING STUDIES IT'S AN AREA THAT STILL NEEDS A LOT OF WORK BUT THERE ARE SOME REALLY WONDERFUL PAPERS ON THIS AND THE ONE THAT I MENTION A FEW MINUTES AGO SEX DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTIVE HORMON INFLUENCES ON HUMAN OTOR PERCEPTION IS OF ONE OF THE BETTER EVIEWS THAT ARE OUT THERE THERE ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER REVIEWS FOR INSTANCE THAT TALK ABOUT FAREMON EFFECTS AND THEREARE IMPACT ON MOOD AND SECUAL RESPONSES AN THINGS THAT SORT AND WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE SOME LINKS TO THOSE A LOT OF THIS IS STILL SPECULATIVE BUT I WANT TO SAY I KNOW I SAT THREE TIMES WUT I REALLY WANT O UNDERSCORE BECAUSE IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT AND PEOPLE SEEM TO GET A L TRIGGERED BY THE NOTION OF PAREMONES JUST BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED THE ACTUAL CHEMICAL COMPOUND THAT'S ACTING AS A FAREMON OR PUTITIVE FREMON DOES NOT MEAN THAT CHEMICAL CHEMICAL SIGNALLING BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS DOESN'T EXIST CLEARLY IT DOES ACTUALLY YOU AND EVERY OTHER HUMAN FROM THE TIME YOU'RE BORN UNTIL THE TIME YOU DIE ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING OUT ND SENSING AND AVALUATING THE CHEMICALS THAT COME FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS THE REALLY NICE STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY THE WHITESMEN INSTITUTE A GROUP THERE I THINK IT WAS ALSO NOME SOBLES GROUP BUT ANOTHER GROUP AS WELL AS I RECALL LOOKING AT HUMAN HUMAN INTERACTIONS WHEN THEY MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S A REMARKABLE STUDY BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS PEOPLE WOULD REACH OUT AND SHAKE HANDS IS THE TYPICAL RESPONSE YOU KNOW PREPANDEMIC PEOPLE WOULD MEET THEY'D REACH OUT AND THEY WOULD SHAKE HANDS AND WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS ALMOST EVERY TIME WITHIN JUST A FEW SECONDS OF HAVING SHAKEN HANDS WITH THIS NEW INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WILL TOUCH THEIR EYES ALMOST WITHOUT FAIL OCCASIONAL LY WOULD TOUCH THEIR EYEBROW OCCASION SON WTOUCH THEIR HAIR WE ALWAYS ASSOCIATE THAT WITH PEOPLE HAVING SOME SORT OF ON OR US HAVING SOME SORT OF SELF CONSCIOUS RESPONSE LIKE OU WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHERE YOU KNOW TUCKED IN AND ALL YOU KNW PRIM IMPROPER WHATEVER IT IS OR LOOKING RIGHT AS THER SELLING IN MY TEETH THIS KINDTHING BUT ACTUALLY PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT EVEN IF THE PERSON THEY JUST MET LEFT THE ROOM SO SOME WHONE SITTING THERE SOMEONE COMES IN THEY SHAKE HANDS AND THE PERSON INEVITABLY SUBCONSCIOUSLY TOUCHES THEIR EYES THEY ARE TAKING CHEMICALS FROM THE SKIN CONTACT AND THEY ARE PLACING IT ON A MUCOSAL MEMBRANE OF SOME SORT TYPICALLY NOT UP THEIR NOSE ARE IN THEIR MOUTH TYPICALLY ON THEIR EYES NOW ANIMALS DO THIS ALL THE TIME THERE'S A PHENOMENON ANIMALS CALLED BUNTING IF YOU HAVE A OVEREAGER DOG THAT AH WHEN YOU MEET THEM OR YOU SEE THEM AGAIN AFTER YOU'V BEEN AWAY FOR THE DAY THEY RUB THEIR HEAD AGAINST YOU RIGHT CATS WILL DO THIS TOO ITS CALLED BUNTING THEY'R RUBBING THEIR SENT GLANDS ON YOU THEIR MARKING YOU AND BELIEVE IT ARE NOT YOUR MARKING OTHER PEOPLE WHEN YOU SHAKE THEIR HAND AND THEY ARE THEN TAKING YOUR MARK AND RUBBING IT ON THEMSELVES SUBCONSCIOUSLY SO WE ALL DO THESE KINDS OF BEHAVIORS AND NOW THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF IT YOU CAN WATCH FOR IT IN YOUR VIRONMENT YOU CAN YOU KNO PAY ATTENTION TO PEOPLE SOME OF THIS IS PROBABLY CHANGED IN LIGHT OF THE EVENTS OF TWENTY TWENTY ET CETERA BUT NONE THE LESS WE ARE VALUATING THE MOLECULES ON PEOPLE'S BREATH WE ARE EVALUATING THE MOLECULES ON PEOPLE'S SKIN BY ACTIVELY RUBBIING IT RUBBING IT ON OURSELVES AND WE ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN SENSING NOTCIOUS THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THE SIZE OF THEIR PEOPLES AND THING LIKE THAT BUT THE CHEMICALS THAT THEY ARE EDMITTING THEIR HORMON STATUS HOW THEY SMELL WERE DETECTING THE FARMONES POSSIBLY BUT CERTAINLY THE ODORS IN THEIR BREATH YOU MIGHT SAY WELL I DON'T ACTALLY GO ROUND SNIFFING PEOPLE'S BREATH AN ON YOU KNOW UNLESS IF IT'S BAD IN WHICH CASE IT'S AVERSIVE BUT BREATH IS COMMUNICATING A LOT OF SIGNALS AND THIS HAND SHAKE EYERUB EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY GOING THROUGH BEHAVIORS REFLECTIVELY TO WIPE OURSELVES OR SMEAR OURSELVES WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S CHEMICALS NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM ODD OR EVEN GROSS TO YOU BUT A I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL I THINK THAT IT ILLUSTRATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE AS HUMAN BEINGS ARE IN SOME WAYS AMONG THE OTHER ANIMALS IN OUR SUBCONSCIOUS SOMETIMES CONSCIOUS BUT CERTAINLY SUBCONSCIOUS TENDENCY TO TRY ND O VALUATE OUR CHEMICAL ADVIRONMENT THROUGH WHAT WE INHAL THROUGH OUR NOSE WHAT WE INJEST THROUGH OUR MOUTH AND WHAT WE ACTIVELY TAKE OFF OTHER PEOPLE'S SKIN AND RUB ON OURSELVES TO AVALUATE IT AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO ABOUT IT AND PERHAPS THAT PERSON AS WELL SO TO DAY WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT OR FACTION TASTE AND CHEMICAL SENSING BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS I LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU NOW KNOW A LOT ABOUT HOW YOUR SMELL SYSTEMD WORKS AND WHY INHAILING IS A REALLY GOOD THING TO DO IN GENERAL FOR WAKING UP YOUR BRAIN AND FOR COGNIVE FUNCTION AND FOR ENHANCING YOUR SENSE OF SMELL TALKED ABODOEN HANCE YOUR SENSE OF TASTE AND WE TALKED ABOUT CHEMICAL SIGNALLING BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AS A WAY OF COMMUNIC ATING SOME IMPORTANT ASPECTS ABOUT BIOLOGY PEOPLE ARE SHAPING EACH OTHER'S BIOLOGY ALL THE TIME BY WAY OF THESE CHEMICALS THAT ARE BEING TRADED FROM ONE BODY TO THE NEXT THROUGH EIR AND SKIN TO SKIN CONTACT AND TEARS IF YOUR ENJOING THIS PODCAST IN YOUR FINDING THE INFORMATION USEFUL PLEASE SUBSCRIBE ON YOU TOB THAT'S ONE OF THE

THE WHOLE THING AND THEN IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINE ZAC FOUND HIMSELF WALKING OUT OF HIS APARTMENT BUILDING AND ON TO THE SET OF A TEVY PILOT IN WHICH HE WAS THE STAR EVERYTHING JUST LOOKED PERFECT LIKE A COAT COMMERCIAL IT WAS A GORGEOUS DAY EFALL DAY NEW YORK SONNY THERE WAS A REALISTIC AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ON THE STREET BUT NOT SO MANY THAT THE SCENE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE RUSHHOUR CAUSE IT WASN'T IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY SHOULD LOOK LIKE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND EVERY ONE AS ALSO JUST A LITTLE TOO ATTRACTIVE LIKE ACTORS EVERYONE I DON'T HAVE ADIO OF THIS BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER ACTUALLY RECORDED BECAUSE IT WASN'T A TEVY PILOT THOSE PEOPLE ON THE STREET WEREN'T ACTORS THIS WASN'T ZAC'S FIRST BIG BREAK IN TO SHOW BUSINESS IT WAS HIS FIRST BIG CYCOTIC BRAK LIKE THE PART OF HIS BRAIN THAT WANTED TO BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT ALL THE TIME HAD SUDDENLY EXPLODED ZAC WAS EXPERIENCING A TYPE OF DELUSION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ON THE SHOW BEFORE IT'S CALLED THE TRUMAN SHOW DELUSION NOT INCREDIBLY COMMEN BUT NOT AS RARE AS YOU MIGHT THINK EITHER ZAFFER IS OF TREMENT SHOWE DELUSION BASICALLY THINK THERF BEING FILMED LL THE TIME BY HIDDEN CAMERAS JUST LIKE THE JIM CARRY CHARACTER IN THE WOBE THE TRIMAN SHOW IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE BRAK ZAC HAD BEEN SHOWING SIGNS OF THIS ON COMING SPLIT WITH REALITY LITTLE HARDENGERSN AND BIGGER ONES HE'D BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE MANNAT SLEEPING LESS AND LESS I HAD SOME FRIENDS IN FAMILY START TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT ME AND I KIND IT HAS BRUSHT IT ALL OFF UM YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON MY BRAND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND R I COMED YOU DON'T ANSTAND OUT TO DO COMEY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND U YOU COMEDY AFTER YOUR LAWYER ALL THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND OUT TO WRIHT A JOKE LOOK ITS A MATHEMATICAL  CLACIAN LET ME SHOW YOU THIS IS A PREMISE THIS WHY THIS IS FUNNY THIS WHY THAT'S NOT FUNNY A THAT'S YOUR INNER MONOLAG YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND AND OUT OF MONOLOG HEVEN THE PRODUCER WAS CONCERNED TOLD ZAC HE HAD TO GO SEE A DOCTOR IF THEY'RE WHEN TO KEEP WORKING TOGETHER AND YET WHEN ZAC WALKED OUT OF HIS APARTMENT BUILDING ON TO THE STREET THAT DAY HE WAS SURE  THE PRODUCER HAD STAGED EVERYTHING JUST FOR HIM IN ZAC WAS REATY TO PERFORM THINKING OF HIMSELF AS SOME HIGH BRAD OF ALLY G AND JOHNNY KNOCK VILL I'M THINKING MY FRIEND THE BRILLIANT PRODUCER HAD THE SID ED YOU KNOW WHAT ZAC'S NOT REALLY AN ACTOR HE'S NOT GOING TO KNOW HOW TO ACT I'M JUST GOING A THROW HI MEN SOMEWHERE HE'LL EVENTUALLY GET WHAT HE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND HEELS HIS KIND OF LIKE BASTELY METHOD ACT HIMSELF HE COULD PROBABLY DO THAT YOU KNOW SO I GO TO TOFFKAN SQUARE PARK SOON AS I'M IN THERE AH I SPIT GENERIC OLD MAN ON PARK BENCH TAT'S WHAT IT WOULD SAY IF IF HE WAS IN THE CREDITS YES AND HE HAD A BIKE AH AND HE WAS TOO OLD TO HAVE A BIKE ANOTHER TELL AT THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD BEEN CORDONED OFF TO SHOWCASE ZAC'S COMMEETIC TALENS ZAC THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF HE GRABBED GENERIC OLD MAN'S PIKE AND DID A COUPLE LAPS AROUND THE PARK WITH IT GENERIC OLD MAN DID NOT TAKE KINDLY TO ZAC TRYING TO GRAB HIS BIPE AWAY ZAC RELENTED WAS SURELY ASSIGNED FROM THE PRODUCER KEEP THANKS MOVING ZA ZAC TAKES OFF IN A SPRING TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK AND FALTS OVER THE WALL OF THIS BIG DOGGY PLAYPEN I GET DOWN LIKE ON ALL FOURS MYSELF ON MY GALP WITH THE PACT RUNNING TOWARD THE END OF THE FENCE I JUMP OUT THE OTHER SIDE AND  MI ARA YOU KNOW COOL WHATEVER THAT WAS WORTH I I DID IT YOU KNOW NOW MONEY MAYBE YET HAT WAS MUNEY MAYBE OU KNOWS AND I ALSO WAS THINKING THAT THE PEDESTRIANS WERE EXTRAS DOUBLING IS PRODUCTION ASSISTANCE AND I'M SPOSED TO FOLLOW THEM FOLLOW THE FOOT TRAFFIC THAT WILL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO YO KNOONE'S COMING UP TO ME WITH A CLITBOARD AN A SHOT WISTER ANYTHING NSO THERE THEN PHONING AHEAD TO THE PRODUCER WHATEVER PRODUCTION YOUNIT SAYING OGET HE'S ON FIRST AVENUE I'S ALMOST TO HOUSE AND A YOU KNOWN LIKE OKI WILL MAKE HIM GO MAKE HIM GO WEST THEN WHENEVER ZAC TELLS THIS STORY HE HAS A WHOLE MENUE OF DERANGED THINGS HE DID THAT DAY TO TALK ABOUT OURS RUNNING AROUND A SOCRAFIELD WITH HIS SHORT S PULLED DOWN WHILE THE GAME IS GOING ON ORDERING CHAMPAGNE ON A HOTEL PATIO AND PROCEEDING TO YELL AT THE CAMERS IN THE TREES AS ZAC REMEMBERS IT AND ZAC'S MEMORY IS ALL WE HAVE TO GO ON THIS TELLO VISION NONDAY VEW LASTED FOR ABOUT TEN HOURS A TEN HOUR NARCASISAN VARIETY SHOW ARRANGED FOR HIM TO GIVE THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS LIVES I I SPRENTED ACROSS THE INTERSECTION OF THEN HE WAS HAUSTEN AND FIRST AVENUE AH WAL CARS WERE MAVI O YET THAT'S IN CREDIBLY DANGEROUS NOT IF ITS PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS ON A CLOSED COURSE AT ITS HEIGHT EVERYTHING HE DID WAS THE RIGHT THING TO BE DOING HE WAS A MASTER OF IMPROVISATION FOLLOWING ALL THE CUES PERFECTLAY AND THEN HE STARTED GETTING TIRED AND THEN EXHAUSTED EVERYTHING WAS STILL A CLUE BUT HE WASN'T SURE WHAT ANY OF IT MEANT ANY MORE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY HE LOST HIS SHIRT AND ALLSO HIS SHEERS AND THE NEXT THING HE KNEW HE WAS STANDING ON A BROOKLYN SUBWAY PLATFORM HANDS BEHIND HIS HEAD LIKE A CAPTURED SOLDIER CRYING SO HARD HE FLUSHED HIS CONTACTS OUT OF HIS IVES ALL HE WANTED WAS FOR SOME ONE TO YELL CUT THINKING TO HIMSELF COKET FIND YOU'VE GOT YOUR SHOTS CAN'T YOU SEE TH I'M BAWLING CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M HERE SUFFERING CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M DONE LIKE COME OUT COME OUT WHEREVER YOU ARE MISTER PRODUCER  SO I'M CRYING AND I JUST LIKE SCREAM YOU KNOW WICK WHA YOU WALP FROM ME TWO COPS COME UP THERE UNIFORMS LOOK REAL SUPERREAL THE NEXT THING I RECALL WITH ANY CLARITY IS BEING IN THE BACK OF AN AMBULENCE AH AND EVENTUALLY I HEAR RADIO CRACK ON IT ZIKE YOU KNOW SH AND TAKE A VABABLEET BE YOU SYC WART ZAC WAS EVENTUALLY DIGNOS WITH BY POLAR DISORDERED TYPE ONE WHICH CAN INVALPSYCOSIS SOMETIMES IN ZAC'S CASE LACK OF SLEEP AND DAILY POT SMOKING MIGHT HAVE TRIGGERD THE EPISODE AT BEL L VIEW HE SAYS THEY DOSED HIM UP WITH ANTICYCOTICS AT TIMES HE COULD BARELY LIFT HIS CHINOF OF HIS CHEST HE DRUELLED ALOT HE COULDN'T GO OUTSIDE ZAC'S ONLY EXPERIENCE WITH PCYCH WARDS BEFORE THIS WAS AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER BREPRESENTING E DE PEAS OR EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED PEOPLE AND NOW HE WAS ONE THE DELUSION THAT HE WAS ON T V LASTED IN ONE FORM ER ANOTHER FOR THE NEXT TEN DAYS HE SAW HIS MOTHER SINDY COMING DOWN THE HALL ON DA TOO HE WASN'T SURE AT FIRST IF IT WAS HER OR AN ACTOR AN PROSTHETICS HE CALLS HER BIRD BECAUSE THE WAY SHE SNAPPS HER HEAD BACK AND FORTH SOMETIMES THE BIRD IS HERE SHE TOLD HIM THE BIRD CAMP BE HERE HE SAID BIRD LIVES IN WITCHITO SHE SAID THE BIRD GOT ON A PLAIN IT TOOK MORE THAN A YEAR AND A COUPLE MORE EPISOTES LIKE THIS BEFORE HE GOT STABLE ALONG THE WAY HE FIGURED OUT A FEW THINGS HAD TO BE GOOD ABOUT TAKING HIS METS AND SLEEP WAS KEY HE COULDN'T BURN THE CANDLE AT ALL ENDS LIKE HE HAD BEEN GOING ON STAGE ALL THE TIMESO HE STOPPED FOR THE MOST PART HAPED WORKING HIS DAJOP AS A LAWYER THEY SAY YOU HAVE TO BE AT LEAST A LITTLE CRAZY TO BE A COMEDIAN BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO BE SO CRAZY THAT YOU CAN'T BE A COMEDIANT ZAC HAS TOLD THE STORY OF THIS PCYCHOTIC BREAK COUNTLESS TIMES AT THIS POINT IT'S A GOOD ROMP AND HE'S GOT IT DOWN ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS TELLS IT ENTERTAININGLY BUT WHILE IT'S ONE THING TO RECOUNT SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR MEMORY IT'S ANOTHER THING IF SOME ONE CATCHES IT ON VITIO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOURSELF IN PCYCHOSES I SAY THIS BECAUSE AFTER ZAC GOT BETTER AND THOUGHT HE WAS TOTALLY OUT OF THE WOODS SANITY WAS HE DID HAVE ANOTHER CYCHOTIC BRAK AND IT WAS CAPTURED ON VITIO AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE ZAN ZAC WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF TRUMEN SHOW DELUSION ICTO THESIRAM  AN A STOP THAT AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED SO AFTER A WHILE ZAC QUIT LAWYERING AND DECIDED TO TRY TO MAKE IT AS A WRITER HE WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THAT FIRST PCSYCHOTIC BREAK AND HIS DISORDER CALLED GORILLA AND THE BIRD GERILLA IS ZACENIC NAME CAUS HE'S REALLY HARRY IN BARRELL CHESTET GAN TE BIRD IS HIS MOM E WAZAPTION FOR A TEV SERIES BEFORE IT EVEN CAME OUT H BEO IS PLANNING TO RUN IT THE DIRECTOR JOHN MARK VALET WHO DID BIG LITTLE LIES ON SHARP OBJECTS IS ON PURE AC AN I HAVE HAD ENTIRE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHO MIGHT PLAY HIM ON THE TEVSHO ABOUT THE TIME HE THOUGHT HE WAS ON A TEVCHO AND WASN'T IN ZAC HIS THERAPIST SAID TO HIM SORT OF JOKING BUT SORT OF NOT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT END UP PLAYING YOURSELF ON THAT SHO TO WHICH ZAC BASICALTLE RESPONDED YET THINK THEY MIGHT WANT TO GO WITH ONE OF THESE ALESS CELEBRITIES THEIR CONSIDERING AND THEN ZAC WAS TRYING TO FIGERE OUT WAYS TO PROMOTE HIS BOOK AND OF COURSE THESE DAYS A LOT OF AUTHORS MAKE VITIOS WHEN THEIR BOOKS COME OUT AND SO ZAC HIRED A PRODUCTION CREW TO SHOOT FOOTEGE FOR HE WASN'T SURE WHAT A PROMOTIONAL VITIO BUT IF IT WAS ANY GOOD MAY BE THEY'D DO A BIGGER DOCUMEMORY OEU WANTED TO TAKE THEM BACK HOME WITH HIM TO WITCHITOT TO INTERVIEW SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE'D WRITTEN ABOUT IN HIS MEMOIR MEANING HIS FAMILY HAVE THE CREW FOLLOW HIM AROUND HIS HOME TOWN FOR A WEE JUST ROLLING ON EVERYTHING DOCUMENTARY STYLE THE CREW CONSISTED OF TWO PROFESSIONAL CAMERAMEN AND A VERY SEASON T V PRODUCER THAT ZAC HAPPEN O BE FRIENDS WEYT HE'D BEEN AROUND CAMERAS A MUNCH BEFORE THIS BY THE WAY AND DIDN'T TRIGGER HIS DISORDER SO THE MORNING THE DELUSION REALLY HIT ZAC HADN'T MET UP WITH THE FILM CREW YET THEY WERE ACTUALLY WONDERING WHERE HE WAS HE WAS SPOSED TO CALL INSTEAD HE WAS DRIVING AROUND WHITCHITO BY HIMSELF IN HIS GRANDFATHER'S PICUP HE WAS FIGHTING SERIOUS BAC PAIN AND HE HAD BARELY SLEPT IN THREE DAYS AGAIN SLE APLESSNESS IS A HUGE TRIGGER FOR HIS EPISODES AN THE BOOK HE WRITES THE SOLUTION TO MANIA IS SO SIMPLE YET SO HARD TO COME BY JUST SLEEP AND THE THING HIS THERAPIST SAID CAME BAC TO HIM THAT JOHN MARK VALET MIGHT WANT HIM TO PLAY HIMSELF ON THE TVY SHO I CAME TO BELIEVE THAT OH MY GOD MAYBE MY THERAPIST WAS CONTACTED BY WHOEVER IT MAYBE I REALLY IM ADDITION IN FOR MYSELF SO RIGHT NOW I I AM NODDITIONING TO PLAY THE ROLE OF MY SELF I'M IN THE PROCESS OF AN ADDITION YES AND I WAS HIS TESTING HAT SLOWLY BECAUSE IWAS I BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW YOU'VE HAD THIS DELUSION BEFORE AND YOU'VE BEEN WRONG AND NOT ONLY THAT I KNOW HOW THE WORLD WORKS A LITTLE BIT E I KNOW EACH BEO ISN'T JUST LIKE YET LET HIM PLAY HIMSELF A GREAT IDEA I NO SO BUT S LIKE I DON'T KNOW YOU DIRECTOR'S KIND OF CRAZY I HE TAKES A LOT OF RISKS AND SITTING IN THE TRUCK HE STARTED TO HAVE THE FEELING THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PEOPLE HE KNEW WOULD BE FILMING HIM LATER THAT DAY THERE WERE ALSO OTHER CAMERAS THAT HE COULDN'T SEE AND MAYBE OUDIORECORDERS TOO POSSIBLY RIGHT THERE IN THE TRUCK WITH HIM I WAS LISTENING TO A SONG AND HIS TRUCK AND I WAS KIND OF DANCEIN A LITTLE BIT NOT'S LIKE AT THIS IS KIND OF FUNNY AND IW'S LIKE MAYBE O'RE NOT BEING TAPERY NOW I THAT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT MAKES ZETS WAS I BUT MAYBE YOU ARE SO MAYBE JUST GIVE THEM A LITTLE SOME IN TO THANK ABOUT LEAVE THEM WITH SOMETHING LIKE O A YOU KNOW HE'S HE'S GOTTLE SOMETHING THAT HE'S WRAND HE NEED'S A TRAINING BUT WE GOT SOMETHING WE CAN POSSIBLY WORK WITH YOU SO ONCE AGAIN THE POWERS THAT BEE HAD SPOTTED ZAC'S LATE IN TALENT AND SETT IT UP SO HE COULD JUST DO HIS THING IN THE WILD WOW THE CROWD WO TWO MUCH OF IT DOU IF WE MUST HIT'S WHAT'H THE VIDIO THISS GUNNE HURT REALLY I THINK SO HO CO WEL I THINK I'M MIN A FEL BED FOR THE DUTOMAN WATCH WHO IS ME TO OF VIEO IT STARTS WITH THE PRODUCTION CREW IN THEIR CAR WITHOUT ZAC IT'S JUST ONE CAMERAMAN AND ZAC'S TEVY PRODUCER FRIEND JAY THEYRE HEADING TO A TALKO SHOP TO MEE ZAC THEY PULLE UP TO A STANDALONE BUILDING SURROUNDED BY A BIG PARKING LIE AND THEY ARRIVE AT THE SAME TIME AS ZAC'S FAMILY FRIEND ROB AND OLDERGUY WITH A WHITE BEARD AND A TANBALL CAP E CAMERAMAN'S WALKING AROUND THE SIDE OF THE TA O PLACE AND THERE YOU ARE N A MAN YE ZACSIN A SPIDER MAN CROUCH WITH HIS HANDS ON THE GROUND STARING DOWN IS WEARING IN A DETIST TEASHERT AND SWEAT PAN NO GLASSES HE DROPPED THEM SOMEWHERE WHICH MEANS HE CAN'T SEE ANYTHING HES CLEARLY IN A LOT OF PHYSICAL PAIN IT'S HIS BACK IN IT SPASMING I'M ON MY HANDS IN NEES NOW I'M TRYING TO STAND UP I CAN'T BE DESRANS ARE ASKING A FOROR GAY MY FREND DAY SAYING HESE O GAYSE O GAY IT WASN'T ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CLEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ZAC THAC TINT AND JANE THE OTHERS WERE TRYING TO HELP HIM TO GET HIM INTO A CAR SO HE COULD GET BACK TO HIS HOTEL AND SLEEP TUT THEY ALSO KEPT FILMING BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ENTIRE GOLL OF THE WEEP AND THEY THOUGHT ZAC MIGHT WANT THIS FOOTEDGE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HIS BOOK WAS ABOUT AND HERE IT WAS HAPPENING ZAC MEANWHILE WAS NOW PRETTY CONVINCED HE WAS ADDITIONING TO PLAY THE ROLL OF HIMSELF ON THE TEVY SHOW THAT AGAIN HE'S ACTUALLY BEING PRODUCED ABOUT THE TI IM HE THOUGHT HE WAS ON A TIVY SHO SOME BLURRY CALCULUS TOLD HIM THAT HIS PRODUCER FRIEND JAY AND JOHN MARK VALET MUST BE IN COMMUNICATION SOMEHOW IN THE VIDEO ZACS ON HIS KNEES SWAYING BACK AND FORTH IN FRONT OF THE TACKO STAND HE CLOSES HIS EYES THEN OPENS THEM AND LOOKS TOWARD THE CAMERA THE ONE THAT ISN'T THERE AND I'M SAYING TOO MUCH TOO MUCH    IT WAS FREEKY TO SEE MY FRIEND LIKE THIS IT SEEM PEOPLE IN THE PARK WERE ON THE SUBWAT ACTING LIKE ZAC WAS THAT DAY THEY'RE JUST SO LITERALLY LOST AND DON'T KNOW IT BUT YOU KNOW IT IT'S LIKE THE RIGHT BESIDE YOU ON THE SIDEWALK AND ALSO IN A FOREST THAT THEY CAN'T BE GUIDED OUT OF NOT EASILY BUT IN THIS CASE ZAC WAS SITTING NEXT TO ME WATCHING WITH ME AND HE REMEMBERS EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS HEAD AT THAT MOMENT I CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THROUGH SOME COMBINATION OF JOHN MARK AND MY FRIEND HEAR JE PRODUCER THAT WE HAD MAY BE A YOGA INSTRUCTOR WHO WAS WATCHING MY MOVEMENTS AND COULD TELL BY THE WAY I WAS MOVING HOW MUCH PAYIN I WAS IN AND WHERE I WAS AND PAIN OH HOW I I THINK I THOUGHT THERARE EVEN SHOCKING MY SPINE SOMEHOW THOS BACK SPASAMS HE THOUGHT THEY WERE ELECTRICAL SHOCKS BEING TRIGGERED BY THIS MAGICAL IMAGINARY YOGA INSTRUCTOR HE MOVES IN AND OUT OF DIFFERENT YOGOPOSES ON THE GROUND AND I THINK IT LIKE THERE THINKING THAT IF WE SHOCKED HIM THIS WAY HE WOULD NOT LY MOVE HIS BODY TO CORRECT HIS POSTURE THAT WELL LEVE HIS PAING BUT IT CAN ALSO POINT HIM TOWARD WHATEVER CAMERA WAS CAPTURING THE PARTICULAR FOOTAG THOUG WAS GOING TO BE SENT TO JOHN MARK VALET THE REAL DIRECTOR OF THE REAL SERIES GIRRILL IN THE BIRD O I SEE SO IT WAS BOTH TO HELP YOU AND ALSO FOR PRODUCTION VALUS RIGHT AND WHEN NOT YOU SEE ME WAVIN MY HAND AND WAVING THEM OFF YAT MEANS LIKE I'M NOT GOOD A NOW I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE SHOT BUT YOU'RE NOT SAYING STOP FILMING TOO THE PERSON WHOS FILMING THIS NO YOU'RE SAYING THAT TOO THE LARGER PRODUCTION TE THAT DOESN'T EXIST  WHICH WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT TAKES A CERTAIN TYPE OF GENIUS BECAUSE ZAC'S ORIGINAL DELUSION THAT HE WAS BEING FOLLOWED AROUND BY CAMERAS HAD COME TRUE HIS BRAIN HAD TO COME UP WITH A SECOND LEVELE ILUSION THAT AGAIN INVOLVED REAL PEOPLE THE WAY HE EXPLAINED IT TO ME IT'S NOT LIKE HE FORGETS REALITY ORE HALLUCINATES AT THE CAMERA'S RELLY THE DRAGON OR SOMETHING HE'S ABLE TO TAKE IN ALL THE DATA IN FRONT OF HIM IT'S JUST THAT HE COMES TO THE WRONG CONCLUSIONS ABOUT IT O YOU THA  AT THAT FINALLY ZAC MAKES IT TO HIS FEET AND THEN WALKS OFF TO THE MIDDLE OF THE PARKING LON STICKS HIS HAND IN THE AIR AND AGAIN SAYS TO MUCH TOO MUCH TOO MUCH WAIT TOO MUCH AND THEN HE'S BACK DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND FINALLY ON HIS BACK LYING IN THE PARKING LOT AS CARS PASSIM ZAC WAS RIGHT ABOUT WHAT HE SAID BEFORE THAT IT WAS GOING A HURT TO WATCH THIS I THINK I'M CIND OF JUST LIKE WWO I THINK I'M JUS BRACING MYSELF FOR IT THE WHOLE TIME AND M KIND OF LIKE RUTEN FOR THE GUY AND FEELING BAD FOR HIM IN LIKE PUC OH PLEASE STOP OH PLEASE STOP BUT IN THE SAME WAY I WOULD FEEL BAD FOR SOME ONE I SAW ON THE STREET WAS YELLING AT PIGEON SRIN OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCES I KNOW THAT GUY A LITTLE BETTER YOU KNOW THE GUY THAT WE SAW IN HE VIDIO LITTLE VETTE I DO ILLFINALLY THEY MANAGED TO GET ZAC BACK TO HIS HOTELL AN THIS IS WHEN WE LEARNE ABOUT A WHOLE OTHER SIDE OF PSYCOTIC ZAC WHEN THAT'S EVEN HARDER FOR SAYING ZAC TO WATCH SO ROBSTAYS BEHIND AND THE CAST IS NOW JA THE TIVY PRODUCER FRIEND AND NOW TWO CAMMERMEN TREVER AND TYLER THE WEN GOT ALL OF IZACS STUFF FROM HIS MOM'S HOUSE WHERE HE'D BEEN STAYING EARLIER HIS MEDICATION IN HIS CLOTHES IN EVERYTHING AND THEY ROLL UP HI ZAC'S HOTEL ROOM DOOR WITH ONE OF THOSE

RESTING A HARVARD PROFESSOR IN HIS OWN HOME PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME UNDER FIRE CAMSH POLIECE I MUC STUPID I THE YOR TATY THE KNOWS US KNOWS THAT I THIN TE PRESET MI O POLGIN  PALL WOR FORSPO PRESON O WHA TEN TRI CONTRI TO PROFESSOF  THIS PRESIDENT I THINK HAS EXPOSED HIMSELF AS A GUY OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHO HAS A DEEP SEEDID HATRED FOR WHITE PEOPLE OR THE WHITE CULTURE I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS I NOT SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T WHITE  WHITE PEOPLE I SAY HE HAS A CROBLEM HE HAS A THIS GUYE IS I BELIEVE A RACIS THA WAS GON BACK ON FOX NEWS CONFAMOUSLY YE SO THAT WAS ONE REACTION BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY CIVIL RIGHTSCRUPS ARE CALLING THE WHITE HOUSE AND THINKING OBAMA FOR PUTTING A SPOTLIHT ON THIS ISSUE THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM SO ESSENTIALLY PRISON MABAMA HAD AFERTLESSLY DIVIDED THE COUNTRY WITH THIS ONE WORD STUPIDLY IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO TRIGGER I POLORIZE THE POLICE FROM THE COMMUNITIES OF THEY SERVANT PROTACT IT WAS REALLY AND OF AN OFF HANDED COMMENT AND IF PERHAPS HE HADN'T SAID STUPIDLY THINGS WOULD HAVE GO WOULD NOT HAVE GOTIN HIS DERAILED AS THEY DID IIF HE HAD IF HE HAD SAID FOR AN EXAMPLE IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT SKIP WOULD BE ANNOYED THAN A POLICE OFFICER WERD ADDRESS WOULD ARREST HIM IN HIS HOME OI THINK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID YE I'D BE ANNOYED BUT WHEN HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE POLICE OFFICERS IN TEND OR BEHAVIOR I THINK THAT'S WHAT GONE UNDER PEOPLE'S SKIN SO INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE THEY GOING TO FULL CRISIS MODE THE HOPING IT ALL DIE DOWN BUT I DOESN'T SO THEY COME UP IT IS IDEA TO IN VITE GATES AND CRALLEY TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A BEER AND THEN THAT WUN TE PRAC YOUBE A DERYER ED AN WHA ATWY TAY DA MA NEN TO BEAR OMAT AT A  A MAN OR BAN OVERDOD YOUR TOMAT  BEA MIWATED O YOR MEA CARENT THE IT IADA  A ICTURE  YER OTHER   AD  AT WE DID WHAT A ERES ANTI GAN OF THE AN E  STO TH GET TO GT THE FO BEERS COMMINATION DOWN PICTIC PICTURES AND AS WE ONL KNOW THAT DID NOT WORD YA NO IT STILL COMES UP IKE A MONTH AGO AS YOU KNOW OUR COLLAGUE SOHE CHASE WAS THAT IN TRUNPRALLY IN NEW HAMPSHIR THE TALK TO PEOPLE THERE ABOUT WHY THE COUNTRY IS SO DIVIDED AND TWO SUPPER PEOPLE BROUGHT THIS UP ON THEIR OWN WHEN IT TO THIS AS THE MOMENT THAT THEY KNEW THAT OBAMA WAS OUT TO DIVIDE THE COUNTRY WOULD HE DID HIS FIR IS FIRST WHAT A ITHING HORS OER HE WENT AFTER THE COPSING CAMBRIDGE THAT'S THE THING THAT I STARTED IN I REALLY STARTED HE HE STARTED HAT JUST  THE THINGS THAT DID AS STARTING WITH THE THE BEER SOMIT WE HADIN CAMBRIDGE YET ALL THESE DOME THINGS THAT HE DID BEOWN I THOS IS T I WAS IS IS JENGTHEN E CASE O BEAR SOM I DID NOT UNIFY AMERICA RIGHT I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS SO MUCH SINCE IT HAPPENED JUST THE CASUAL WAY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA STEPPED INTO THIS I'VE WON NDERED IF HE WAS LIKE I SAT THE TABLE ALREADY WITH THE RACE CONVERSATION AS A CANDIDATE SO PEOPLE KNOW WHERE IAM COMING FROM IVE WONDERED IF MAYBE HE WAS JUST TRYING TO TEST THE WATER IS RIGHT THEN MAYBE HE JUST THOUGHT WEL LET' JUST SEE HOW LET JUST SEE WHERE WE ARE I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS THAT MUCH THOUGHT I THINK TO YOUR POIN ON HAANA AN ONESTY ROMINAN THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BEFORE HE PUT IT TO ME BUT I'M SURE BECAUSE THE RACE SPEECH HAD GONE SO WELL AND WAS EMBRACED BROADLY AND IT WAS SO RAW AND HONEST NOT HIMSELF HE HOPE THAT PEOPLE HAD A BETTER SENSE OF WHO HE WAS AND BECAUSE HE'D ONE THE PRESIDENCY A AN HAD COMPORTED HIMSELF THROUGHOUT HIS SHORT TENUR AT THAT POINT AS THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF AMERICA I THINK PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HE HAD THE STANDING TO SAY THAT AND AND NOT EXPERIENCED THE BACK LASH AND SO THAT WAS A TEACHING MOMENT TO THAN IU NA FIR  IER FOR HIM PRAWL OF US YEN  DAN TOLD ME HE THINKS THAT IT WASN'T WHAT A BAMA SAID BUT THAT HE WAS THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THAT IF IT WASN'T THIS SO WOULDHAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE I CAY BUT IF THE GOAL OF THE BEER SUMMIT WAS JUST THREE PEOPLE SITTING ROUND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ALITTLE BETTER LIKE EVEN FOR THOSE PEOPLE DID AT WORK I MEAN YET IT KIND OF DID LAKE THEY WERE REALLY MAD BEFORE AND THEN AFTER THE BEER SOM THAT SARGEA CRAWLEY DOTE THIS PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE HE SAYS YOU KNOW WE AGREE THAT WE BOTH HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND WE WANTO STAY IND TOUCH AND THEY STAND TOUCH YET IT SEEMS LIKE IT SINCE THEN A GATES HAS SAID THAT HE AND SARGEA CRAWLEY HAVE DEVELOPED A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND THEN HE DID THIS THING YOU KNOW HE HAS AS PVST V SHOW WHERE HE TESTS TELEBERTIES D'ANNA AND TELLS THEM ABOUT THEIR HISTORY A'M SO HE ASKED CRAWLEY TO DO A DAANNATEST AND FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAVE A COMMON IRISH ANCESTOR A COUSIN SIR ROBIN ANOTHER WORDS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO GET ALONG AND A AND BECOME FRIENDS IN SEE EACH OTHER'S POINTS OF VIEW ESPECIALLY AROUND THE MAGIC POTION THAT WE CALL BEER BUT WEK OF IN A COUNTRY WHERE A MOST OF THE NATION FOR ONE REASON IN ANOTHER CHOOSIS NOT TO BELIEVE THAT SEEMS OUT WA YET BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY OU SHOW TO DAY PEOPLE SITTING DOWN TRYING TO SEE THE OTHER PERSONS POINT OF VIEW OVER BEER IN ALL THESE STORIES NO GETTING BEERI IS INVOLVED AT A CRITICAL TURNING POINT IN ONE STORY THE FATE OF AN ENTIRE NATION IS ITS TAG AC TUALL NOTHE O THINK THAT THES TRUP FOR THEOTHER STORY TO FROM DEBYBASY CHICAGO ITS THIS AMERICAN LIFE STAY WITH US  ONE ONE FOR MY BABY AND ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD SO IF EVERYBODY THEUNITED STATES IN EUROPE BREAKING OFF INTO POLITICAL GROUPS WHO SEEMD TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER LESS AND LEST THESE DAYS THIS GERMAN GOURNALISTS NAMED BASTY ON BERBNER ISMET THE LAST THREE YEARS WERE PUTTING ON PEOPLE FROM THESE KINDS OF GROUPS THAT DISLIKE AND MISTRUST EACH OTHER AND SEE THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY WHO ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND TRY TO GET ALONG HE TRALEN TO A BUNCH OF IFFERENT COUNTRIES LOOKING FOR EXAMPLES OF THIS WERE PEOPLE DO INDEED SOMEHOW COME TO SEE ID EYE SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN DENMARK HE AND A VEWD POLICEMEN WHO DECIDED THAT THE VERY BEST WAY TO COMBAT THE MOST RADICAL PEOPLE THEY FACED JEHADAS AND TEONAZIS WAS TO INVITE THEM IN FOR COFFEE WITH I HAVE TO SAY AMAZING RESULTS AND THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF THE CITY FOUND WAS IN BAZUANA WERE FOR DECATES NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN RUNNING THIS KIND OF BIG AN A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT TO FIGHT TRIBOISM BASEY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT EVERY YEAR THE GOVERNMENT TELLS THOUSANDS OF CIVIL SERVANTS TO JUST PACK UP THEIR BELONGINGS AND MOVE SOMETIMES VERY FAR FROM HOME TO LIVE AND WORK TH PEOPLE WHO ARE SOM AD VERY DIFFERENT FROM THEM THIS PINE IS NOT POPULAR SOMETIMES A PARENT IS FORCED TO WORK HUNDRED MILES FROM AROUND FAMILY BUTHE GOVERNMENT AS STABORNLY STACK WITH THIS PALACY FOR DECATES HERE'S PASTYAN WHEN WHATUONA BECAME INDEPENDENT FROM BRITAIN IN NINETEEN SIX SIX SIX IT WAS ONE OF THE LAST AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO DO SO IMAGINE THE COLONIALESS SLEEV AND YOU ARE THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF PAZUANA FOR YEARS ALL AROUND YOU YOU HAVE SEEN THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN COUNTRIES BECOME INDEPENDENT ATHNIC VIOLANCE FOLLOWS MARLEY BECAME NDEPENDENT IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO YEARS LATER THE TUARIC STARTEF O CIVIL WAR CONGO SAME STORY SOON OF THAT'S INDEPENDENTE THE PROVINCE OF CATANGA TRIED TO BREAK AWAY NAGERIA INDEPENDENCE IN NINETEEN SIXTY VERY SOON THE ECBOS AND HOUSAS STARTED CLASHING HAVING SEEN ALL OF THAT THE EARLY LEADERS IN BAZUANA KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE EXACT THING THAT HAD FUELED THE VIOLENCS IN ALL THOSE COUNTRYES THEY HADED AS WELL A IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THESE BORDERS A WIL JUST TO AN AP AND SOME OF THE LESTRAT BORD US SEE THAT THEY COULD HAVE CUT THROUGH THE PASSING IS FULLY YOU THIS IS SUNITY DOW THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF PAZUANA SHE WAS A KIT BECK IN THE SIXTIES WHEN A FEW PEOPLE IN LONDON THROUGH THE BORDERS OF HER COUNTRY ON A MAP CREATING BAZUANA AND LIK IN ALL THOSE OTHER PLACES IN AFRICA THEY WERE PUTTING A BUNCH OF ETHNIC GROUPS TOGETHER THAT DIDN'T REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER THE COLANGA IN THE NORTH THE BAQUANAA SOUTH OF THE CALA HARI DESERAT THE BANGUATO IN THE CENTRE IN WHATUANA EVERY ONE REFERS TO THESE GROUPS AS TRIBES SO THAT'S WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY IN THIS STORY IN WHATUANA THEY WERE TWENTY TRIBES GIVO TAKE THEY SPOKE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AT DIFFERENT TRADITIONS AND NOW THEY WERE FORCED INTO ONE COUNTRY SO THE EARLY LEADERS FIGURATE TO AVOID THAT KIND OF VIOLENDS HERE WHUT WE NEED TO DO IS BREAKE  UP TRIBELI THANTITIES TAND FORM A TRUE NATION NO MORE AS NO MORE THAN JUST A WEE BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT THEY CAME UP WITH THA PLAN FIRST THEY DECIDED EVERY ONE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER SO IN SCHOOLS THEY WOULD ONLY TEACH ENGLISH AND SAID SGUANA THE OTHER TRIBE LANGUAGES NOT AT ALL SECOND TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM FIGHTING OVER LAND THEY GAVE A PECE OF LAND TO ANY ONE WHO WISHED AND THEY SAID EVERYTHING UNDERNEATH TAT LAND BELONGS TO THE STATE THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE DIAMOND RICHEST COUNTRIES ON EARTH SO WHTEVENS IF IM GIVEN A THITS OFFLAND I SETTLED THERE I DIK AND I FIND A RICH DIAMOND MINE W YOU GET MOVED WHAT YOU MEAN THAT YOU GET MOVED YOU HAVE TO DECLARE THAT TAMINY MY SARAN ITE IS TEY GAINST THE LOR TO ABSOLUTE TO TO KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF YOU CAN'T DEFIND THAM MAN AN AND SO I FIND O A WAT ONCE YO FIND IT IT IS NOT YOURS THERES A LORD THAT JUS VERGE LADY SAYS IT IS IS NOT YOURSIS BELONGSO TO EVERYBODY SO A YOU JUST GET AN ATHERPISOLAN SAM PLACES I WOULD BE SO FRUSTRATED AMSO OF TER TROUBLES E FATA THERE WAS ONE MORE THING PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE PEOPLE TOLD ME THE TRANSFERS WREMEMBER EACH TRIPE AT ITS TERRITORY SO IF YOU WERE FROM A CERTAIN VILLAGE IN THE NORTH YOU WERE MOST LIKELY CALANGA IF YOU WERE FROM THE CENTRAL DISTRICT PROBABLY BANGUA TO SO THEY FIGURED WHY NOT MAKE ALL CIVIL SERVANTS MOVED TO A DIFFERENT TRIBL AREA FROM THEIR OWN FOR A FEW YEARS THERE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEIR TEACHERS AND DOCTORS EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO IT WOULD FORCE PEOPLE TO MIKES IT WOULD BE AN ANTI TRIBALISM TOO WHEN YOU MOVE PEOPLE AROUND YOU AR IN DEVORE TLY FORSEING AND THEN TO TAKE THAT CATAT IN THAT NEW HOME SHEALD UP THE NEW CANTA ANYVIN TO COL THAT HO YOU FORSEING ALI IS INO AND TE THAT FOR SIN FRIENDSHIPS CAN YOU FORCE FRIENDSHIPS DOES THAT KIND OF THING WORK THE TRANSFERS AFFECTED EVERY ONE WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT BY FAR THE LARTEST EMPLOY IN THE

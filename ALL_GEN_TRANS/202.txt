THESE DOCTORS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO BUSY WITH PATIENCE AND DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO NEEDED I VER MECTIN AND HAD COVIT GETTING IVERMACTON BECAME A HUGE FOCUS OF THIS EMERGING PARALLEL MEDICAL SYSTEM E SURPRISING AMOUNT OF THE EMOTION DRIVING THIS MOVEMENT HAS TO DO WITH IVER MACTON YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER IVERMACTON THE HORSE DRUG PEOPLE STARTED TAKING HUGE DOSES TO CURE THEMSELVES OF COVIT AT ONE POINT BUT THE SCIENCE SAYS IVERMACAN DOESN'T WORK FOR COVIT IT'S AN AMAZING DRUG FOR OTHER THINGS LIKE PARASITES NOT COVI NO MATTER THOUGH DOCTORS ON YOU TO WERE PROMOTING THINGS LIKE IVER MACTON AND HAD DROCOR CLORCUIN IS MIRACAL CURES QUICK CHEAP EASY SOLVES FOR COVIT YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT YOU TO BEEN TWITTER AND FACEBOOK REMOVED VIDIOS BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUE WHEN I GOT PUT ON THAT SHORT LIST OF DESIGNATED OFFICIAL MOUS INFORMATION THAT THE TET COMPANIES WHOULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT BUT WHEN THOSE IVERMACTAND LOVING DOCTORS GET SHUT DOWN THEY ONLY GOT MORE FAMOUS WITHIN THE MEDICAL FREEDOM MOVEMENT AND SET UP SHOP ON ALTERNATIVE MEDIATE PLATFORMS LIKE RUMBL AN TELEGRAM THERE CREATED A WHOLE ALTERNATE EGO SYSTEM OF PID CASS AN PODCASTS NETER ALLL YOSY ANI MASIN ERSIN IS BI OT

YOU SAID SPECIFICALLY LIKE MAYBE IT WAS IN BILIGATES BUT YES THERE WAS A POWER GRAB AND THERE WAS MONEY TO BE MADE AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUARE CONSPIRACY THEORIS THAT JUST MEANS THAT THERE'S GREEDY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHICH WE ALL KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M A BAD PERSON CAUSE I BELIEVE OUR GOVERNMENT IS MORE CORRUPT THAN YOU DO THIS IS A PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT IT IS  THERE WAST EFUCTUS GLOBLISH SHIP EL SORSELY ABUT A TOTALLY AGAINST IT  IT MAKE SENSE TO ME THE TINIA WAS THE PERSON WHO THREW HERSELF INTO THIS PROJECT OF BUILDING THIS ALTERNAIVE MEDICAL SYSTEM AND NOW RUNNING THE WEED THE PEOPLE CLENIC AT NINE FIFTY NINE EAST VENICE SHE'S DEAFLY ATTIK MATTERS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS TYPE SHE FEELS LIKE DOCTORS HAVEN'T LISTENED TO HER AN THE PASSED WHEN SHE NEEDED THEM I BASICALLY HAVE A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD SEN AND I HAVE A NINE AND A SEVEN SO I HAD THIRTEEN THIS CARRIAGES IN BETWE YET THAT WAS E THAT WAS AWFUL THAT WAS AWFUL TIME N MY LIFE BUT O YA IT SAAS ERY AT WAS AWFUL SO OBVIOUSLY AND A RECERTRYCERTRY CERTRY SER I THAT'S WHAT I DO AS I DIG GAIN YOU WANTED TO LAKE SOVED THAT FIGURE THAT OUT I LIKE TO SOLVE EVERYTHING TRIED AT LEAST HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING FROM MYSELF NINE MISS CARRIAGES AND TINEA SEEMED TO FIND A DOCTOR WHO FIGURED OUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HELP AND THEN SHE HAD TWO KIDS RIT NARO THE KIDS WHO YEARS LATER WOULD GO ON TO FLICK MASKS ON TO THE BATHROOM FLOOR DURING COVIT I DIDN'T LIKE THAT IT TOOK ME NINE MISS CARRIAGES BEFORE ANYONE CARRED THE TO FIG OUT WHAT THE HAD WAS RON WITH ME WHAT WERE CHRONICALLING HERE REMEMBER IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THIS NEW MAGNIFIED MEDICAL FREEDOM MOVEMENT AT NINE FIFTY NINE EAST VENICE AVENUE HALF PI CAS STUDIO HALF MEDICAL CLENETT AND THE NEXT BIG MOMENT IN THE STORY OF THE CREATION OF THIS BUILDING HAPPENS THAT ARGUABLY THE OPPOSITE OF THIS PLACE THE MAIN HOSPITAL IN THE AREA SERASOTA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL NOT LONG AFTER THE MASKBANDATE EVENT AT THE HOLLOW THIC STARTED UP A POLITICAL ORGANIZING COMPANY TO SUPPORT WHAT HE CALLS FREEDOM CANIDATES AMERICA FIRST CANIDATES ESSENTIALLY TRUMPESTS SHE CALLED AT THE HOLLOW TOO OUT AND THREW A LOT OF MONEY INTO IT THEY SUPPORTED A SLATE OF SCHOOLBOARD CANIDATES WHO SWEPT INTO OFFICE THEY ALSO BACKED ANOTHER GROUP OF CANIDATES FOR LOCAL HOSPITAL SHE ARE SODAMEMORIAL HOSPITAL IS GOVERNED BY A PUBLICLY ELECTED BURD AND THEY SUPPORTED FOUR CANIDATES WHO WERE A LINED WITH THIS MEDICAL FREEDOM MOVEMENT THESE CANIDATES WERE BESICALLY ANTIE EVERYTHING THE HOSPITAL WAS DOING ANTI THE SEEDY SEA PROTICALS THEY USED ANTI THE BACK SCENES THEY ADMINISTERED UPSET THAT THE HOSPITAL DIDN'T OFFER IVR MACTON ANOTHER ALLTERND OF MEDICINES TO PETIANS WHO WANTED IT TO TREAT COVIT THEY COUNT WANTED TO TEAR THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN AND THEY CALLED FOR A BIG INVESTIGATION INTO EVERYTHING THAT HAD TRANSPIRED DURING COVIT THREE OF THEIR PREFERRED CANIDATES ONE NOT ENOUGH TO CONTROL THE BORD ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME NOISE THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL HAS PUBLIC MEETINGS EVERY ONTH AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THOSE HAD BEEN GOING SO YE YE IN FEBRUAR RY OF THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE BORD WAS DELIVERING THE RESULTS OF A THREE YEAR REVIEW OF THE HOSPITALS PERFORMANCE DURING THE COVE PANTEMIC THE REPORT WAS GLOWING THE HOSPITALSE COVE NINETEEN DEATH RATE WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT LOWER AND STATE NATIONAL AVERAGES HOSPITAL STAYS WERE SHORTER TO WHICH IS A PRETTY GREAT VERDICT FOR A PLACE FULL OF ELDERLY PEOPLE THIC IN THE HOLLOW CREW DIDN'T BELIEVE THOSE RESULTS AT ALL THEY STARTE PUSHING FOR A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF THE HOSPITALS COVE PRACTICES CONNFLIKE THOSE FERENZIC AUDITS THAT PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN WANTED AFTER TWENTY TWENTY DEMANDS TO COMB THROUGH EVERY BALLID EVERY GEAR OF THE VOTING MACHINES BUT THIS OF COURSE WAS WAY MORE PERSONAL CAUSE THERE WAS ALL THIS GRIEF AND PAIN MIXED IN WITH THE SUSPICION WHEN WE HAD PEOPLE GETTING UP THERE CRYING AND SAY ALL WE WANT TO DO AS I WANT ANSWERS I WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH THE DA I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY MY HUSBAND DIED WHY YOU WOULDN'T LET ME COME IN THERE WHY YOU WOULDN'T USE IVERMECTON WHY DID YOU GIVE HER REDDASEVER WHEN I TOLD YOU NOT TO GIVE HER RENDASAVIRE ALL OF THESE THINGS WERE COMING UP E TERE AE  E E MY SON WAS THIRTY NINE YEARS OF AGE WHEN HE WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL THIS ONE WOR'N A SAYING UP AT THE MIKE Y ESA E A YE ER   E EREO E THEXUSE YE E RIS IS E ER ERESES  E ALS IT'S LIKE THE DOCTORS ARE MAKING DECISIONS FOR ALL OF US EISOR ER WWARIS R  YES R  WER THEY SAID HIS ORGANS ARE FAILING HE'S THIRTY NINE WOULD YOU MEAN HIS ORGANS ARE FAILING WE ASKED FOR IVER MECTON I HAD MY LAWYER ON THE PHONE THEY REFUSED ALL THE NURSES AND DOCTORS SHE GOES ON HE KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORE BUT THE SD SE PROTOCAL IT'S KILLING PEOPLE DOCTOR MANY GORDUO RAN THE COVED RESPONS AT THE HOSPITAL HE WAS AT THAT HEARING BUT DIDN'T SPEAK IVER MECTON CAME UP IN SO MUCH OF THE TESTIMONY THAT I WANTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THAT IT WAS A STANDIN FOR SO MANY THINGS BUT IT WAS ALSO JUST A DRUG A RELATIVELY HARMLESS DRUG MHY NETCHES GIVE THEM THE IVERMACTON TO TO AVER MECTIN I IT TO ME TO I SIMBLE IT TO WORD WHEN THEY I PROPERLY DONE THAT  THE SHAL BETTI DOT IT NO BETTER THAN BE PEOPLE THAT THAT Y O SHOW NO BENEFIT OF TE PIN O TO BEEN HOW WE GON TO BE YOU KNOW AFTER IT ACTER THE PROPERTY DON' THAT HE SHOW THAT THEYS NO BEN IT IT

PROPER MEDICATION THAT'S WE DRIVES OM NUTS WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LIED TO REFUSE FROM DESEVIR WHICH CAN WORK AND WANT IVER MECTON WHICH DOES NOT YOU KNOW WHICH YOU MAKE NO FEN BO TEM HENIT BECOMES THE PROBLEM THIS IS THE ENBRIDGIBL DIVIDE BETWEEN THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THE MEDICAL FREEDOM PEOPLE IN THIS CASE TO THE ACTO IS IT'S BAD MEDICINE TO NOT GIVE IVERMACTN TO THE PROFESSIONALS IT'S BAD MEDICINE TO GIVE IT THERE'S NOT A MIDDLE GROUND TO BE HAD AND  DOCTOR GORDIO IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST AND HE'S HAD MANY OF THESE CONFRONTATIONS COM VERSATIONS THIS FAMILY MEMBERS DEMANDING ALTURNATIVE COVE TREATMENTS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IT WAS ROUGH MONING THE HOSPITALS COVID RESPONSE HE'D COPED WITH DEATH THREATS AGAINST THIS FAMILY PROTESTSOUTSIDE THE ICY YOU HE'D WORK A

IT KILLED COVIT IN A TEST TOBE PROBALEM WAS THE DOSES IT TOOK WERE MUCH TOO HIGH TO GIVE TO A HUMAN BEING HE SAYS WHEN PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE GING TO DE PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK FOR ALTURNATIVE TREATMENTS TO ALL KINDS OF THINGS FOR EACH I BEE CANSIR THE SEEN IT A LOT OVER THIRTY YEARS AND HIS ATTITUDE IS IF THE TREATMENT WON'T HURT YOU SURE GO GET IT ELSEWHERE IF AN ALL TURNED IF CLENEC GIVES OUT I VER MECTON HE'S LIKE WHATEVER THITE IS NOT GOING TO DO IT AT HIS HOSPITAL I PERTE TV UPON WIT THAT YOU KNOW THKE IT PEOPLE IN TE AN THER GOING TO DEFIDE ON THER ON WHAT THEY ON TO DO A  I CAN DO I GIVEM

STUDIES AN THESE STUDIES I HAVE COME OUT I'VE PERSONALLY SPOKEN LIKE DOCTORS WHO'VE BEEN A VALUATING THE STUDIES AND THAT'S WHERE I'M GETTING MY ANSWERS FROM THE TWO SIDES ON THIS ORE SO DIVIDED AND BOTH SO EMBATTLED THAT THE ONE THING THEY HAVE BIEN COMMON IS HOW MISUNDERSTOOD EACH SIDE FEELS BY THE OTHER AT THAT BOARD MEETING IT SERASOTOMEMORIAL HOSPITAL TWHAS TRUE FOR DOCTOR GORDIA IS TRUE FOR

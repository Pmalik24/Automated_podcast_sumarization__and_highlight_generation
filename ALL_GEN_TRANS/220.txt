UNHAPPY MARRIAGE A FULL TIME JOB A TEEN AGER A TODDLER AND A BABY WHITH NONE OF THE JOY HAVING BARELY LOOKED AT ANOTHER MAN OR WOMAN FOR FOURTEEN YEARS I WAS NOW IMAGINING MYSELF HAVING DRINKS ON A ROOF TOP LOUNGE WITH PLEASANT BUT UNLIKELY EVEN I'M PROMISING COMPANIONS BRYAN AND I WERE ALWAYS STICKALY CLOSE WE LIKED A GROCERY SHOP TOGETHER NOW I EXHAILED WHEN HE WENT FOR A LONG WALK AND RUMINATED LATE AT NIGHT THAT MAYBE I COULD GET HIM A SMALL APARTMENT IN NEW HAVEN WITH SOME KIND OF HELPER IF NEEDED HOW I COULD HAVE CONTEMPLATED HELPER AND MANAGED NOT TO WONDER WHY I WAS THINKING THAT MY SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLD HUSBAND WHO READ FALCHNER AND WORKED OUT THREE TIMES A WEEK WOULD NEED A HELPER I COULDN'T ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT SAY I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE IN THE WORLD THAT I HAD THESE THOUGHTS I DID TELL CLOSE FRIENDS THAT HE WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY WITH HIS MALE MID SIXTYS EARLY RETIREMENT LOOSE ENDS AND IT WILL PASS I SAID TO MYSELF AND LOOK HE'S MAKING STAYIN GLASS I FOUND THE

PURSUING THE OCCASIONAL ZONING FIGHTS AND OUR LITTLE TOWN AND STUDYING THE TOWNS BY LAWS WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM SO REALLY WHAT'S WRONG I COULDN'T SAY BUT I KNEW THAT THIS MAN WAS NOT THE MAN I'D MARRIED AND THE CHANGE HAD HAPPEN NOT OVER FIFTY YEARS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SAD BUT NOT PUZZLING BUT JUST OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS END OF LIFE IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT PEOPLE SAID TO ME WELL WHY GO TO SWITZERLAND I MEAN WHY NOT OR AGON OR COLORADO OR HOR WHY YOUR VERMONT THERE ARE RIGHT TO DIE LAWS IN THOSE STATES THAT SOME PEOPLE SAID THIS TO ME RIGHT BEFORE AND RIGHT AFTER MY HUSBAND DIED WAS MORE THAN AMAZING THE RIGHT TO DIE PHYSICIAN ASSISTED DYING LAWS IN CALIFORNIA COLORADO ORAGON FOR MONT MONTANA NEW MEXICO DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AN NEW JERSEY MAIN WHO WHY AND WASHINGTON REQUIRE THAT YOU BE OR BECOME A RESIDENT OF THAT STATE SOMETIMES QUICK AND EASY NOT ALWAYS IN ORDER TO PURSUE YOUR PHYSICIAN ASSISTED SUICIDE AND ALSO CONSISTENTLY THAT YOU ARE MENTALLY COMPETENT MEDICALLY ASSESSED AS HAVING ONLY SIX MONTHS TO LIVE AND CAN EXPRESS YOUR WISH TO DIE USUALLY THREE TIMES TWICE ORALY AND ONCE IN WRITING TO TOO LOCAL PHYSICIANS PRACTICALLY SPEAKING YOU HAVE TO BE DAMNE CLOSE TO DEATH'S DOOR TO GET A DOCTOR TO SWEAR THAT YOU'LL BE DEAD IN SIX MONTHS YOU HAVE TOO PHYSICIAN INTERVIEWS SOME DAYS APART IN WHICH HOU WAS SERT THAT YOU ARE NOT PCSYCOTIC OR SUICIDAL OR DEPRESSED AND HOPE THE DOCTORS AGREE WITH YOU YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SWALLOW WHATEVER THE DOCTOR FOR SCRIBES WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCS CHOOSING TO DIE AND BEING ABLE TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY WHILE TERMINALLY ILL IS A DELIBERATELY NARROW OPENING MANY PEOPLE CAN'T GET THROUGH IT THEY CAN'T SWALLOW WELL ENOUGH THEY CAN'T TALK WELL ENOUGH THEY CAN'T HOLD THE GLASS OR MIX THE DRINK ON THEIR OWN AND HELPING SOME ONE

DOWN AFTER HE'S GONE I SAY THAT DOCTOR G SEEMED NICE AND BRYAN AGREES BRYAN SAYS IT'S GOING O K AND I AGREE WE SLEEP SIDE BY SIDE FINGER TIPS TOUCHING THURSDAY JANUARY THIRTY IF TWENTY TWENTY ZURIC THE NIGHT PASSES AND THE NEXT MORNING WE HAVE A CAR TAKE US TO FAFACON WHERE DIGNATAS HAS ITS APARTMENT OR HOUSE I COULDN'T REALLY TELL IT'S A RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK TWO NICE WOMEN IN NICE CLOTHES SWEATERS AND SLACKS AMAY I FEEL THAT AN EFFORT WAS MADE THEY DIDN'T JUST THROW ON THEIR SWEATS AND COME OVER READ US THEY HAVE DRESSED FOR THE OCCASION OF SHEPHERDING US ACROSS THE RIVER AND THEY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED WITH SUCH SEAMLESS ATTENTIVE TACK  THEY WALK US IN UP A FEW STEPS TO THE DOOR AND I SEE A SNOW COVERED GARDEN THE KIND OF GESTURE TOARD A GARDEN THAT YOU'D FIND IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK AND INTO A LARGE ODD IMACULATE ROOM THE SEATING IN EVERY CORNER TWO SMALL ARM CHAIRS A LARGE PLEATHER RE CLAINER A PLEATHER SOFA AND A HOSPITAL BED AS WELL IT DAWNS ON ME LATER THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE SAT ON OR LAID DOWN UPON BE WASHABLE IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM THERE'S A TABLE WITH SEVERAL CHAIRS THE LADIES BRING OUR PAPER WORK TO THE TABLE AND POINT OUT THE MANY BOWLS OF CHOCOLATES THEY REVIEW ALL OF THE STEPS WHICH BRYAN AND I CANNOW BOTH RESIGHT THEY LOOK AT HIM CLOSELY AND SAY AT ANY TIME IN THIS PROCESS ANDCLUDING AFTER YOU DRINK THE ANTIAMETIC YOU CAN CHOOSE NOT TO DO THIS WE'LL BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF YOU CHANGING YOUR MIND REST ASSURED WE ARE ASSURED THE ONLY SINE OF RELUCTANCE ON BRYAN'S PART IS WHAT HE WARNED ME ABOUT HIS MAKING CONVERSATION BEFORE TAKING THE SODIUM PENTOBARBATOL HE SAID TO ME THAT HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO JUST BULSH IT AROUND FOR A WHILE WHEN THE TIME CAME TO TAKE IT I KNOW I HAVE TO GO HE SAID I KNOW I'M GOING I'M READY I'M JUST NOT IN A HURRY HE DOESN'T HURRY HE DRINKS THE ANTIAMETIC AND GETS COMFORTABLE ON THE COUCH I SIT NEXT TO HIM HOLDING HIS HAND BUT I HAVE TO LET AT GO BECAUSE HE'S GESTURING WHILE STORY TELLING THE STORIES ARE ALL ABOUT FOOTBALL AT YALE AND HIS COACH CARM COSA AND I COULD TELL THEM WITH HIM BRYAN AND A FRIEND WINDING UP AND JALE BECAUSE OF A YOUNG DON FIGHT IN FRONT OF THE ANCHER BAR AND CARM COSA STERN AND FORGIVING BAILING THEM OUT BRYAN TALKING ABOUT QUITTING FOOTBALL BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET TO PLAY ENOUGH HIS FIRST SEASON AND CARM TELLING HIM THAT HE E CARM WOULD LET BRYAN PLAY WHEN BRYAN WAS GOOD ENOUGH AND NOT BEFORE AND BRYAN RESOLVING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH BRYAN'S FATHER AND CARM COSA PLAYING HAMBALL TOGETHER ONE TIME HIS TWO FATHERS I CANNOT MANAGE TO LOOK INTERESTED IN THESE STORIES BECAUSE I'M NOT BRYAN SAYS NOTHING ABOUT HIS LIFE ABOUT OUR LIFE ABOUT OUR LOVE ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN NOTHING ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL PUBLIC HOUSING HE DESINED AND CARED ABOUT SO DEEPLY WERE THE WORK HE DID FOR CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACES WERE EVEN AND YOU KNOW I MUST BE REACHING HERE ABOUT FISHING BUT I DO TRIE NOT TO LOOK LIKE I'M AN AGONY WHICH I AM THE LADIES WEIGHT IN THE BACK ROOM A KITCHEN I THINK AND AFTER ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES THEY COME OUT AGAIN THEY TELL US THAT THE ANTIAMETIC HAS NOW WORN OFF AND IF BRYAN WISHES TO CONTINUE I DO HE SAYS HE WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT AGAIN THEY SAY YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TIME AND I ROLL MY EYES BECAUSE OF CORSE YE WILL HE ALWAYS DOES I THINK AS IF WE ARE IN SOME OTHER ROOM ON SOME OTHER OCCASION AND THEN I REMEMBER WHERE I AM AND I AM ASHAMED OF MYSELF BRYAN SMILE SLIGHTLY BUT TIMES YOURE PLAIN HE SAYS AND I HAVE NEVER FELT SO BAD ABOUT BEING ME AND MY ENTIRE LIFE HE TAKES THE ANTIAMETIC AGAIN AND THE LADIES PUT AN AIRPLANE PILLOW AROUND HIS NECK BRYAN FALL SILENT AND NOW I LONG FOR THE FOOTBALL STORIES I TAKE BOTH OF HIS HAND S AND HE LETS ME I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I SAY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU TOO HE SAYS AND HE DRINKS THE SODIUM PENDOBARBATOL I KISS HIM ALL OVER HIS HANDSOME WEARY FACE AND HE LETS ME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK ABOUT THE NEXT TWENTY MINUTES I KEEP MY EYES AND HANDS ON HIM AS IF I'LL FORGET WHAT IS LIKE TO BREATHE NEXT TO HIM OR FEEL HIS PRESENTS I DON'T NOT FOR A MINUTE I HEAR HIS BREATHING WHEN I GO TO SLEEP AND I FEEL HIS BODY HEAT WHEN I WAKE UP HE FALLS ASLEEP HOLDING MY HAND AND HIS HEAD FALLS BACK A LITTLE ON THE NECK PILLOW WHOSE PURPOSE I NOW UNDERSTAND IS BREATHING CHANGES AND IT'S THE LAST TIME I WILL HEAR HIM SLEEPING BREATHING DEEPLY AND STEADILY THE WAY HE HAS DONE LYING BESIDE ME FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS I HOLD HIS HAND I CAN STILL FEEL ITS WEIGHT AND WARMTH HIS SKIN COLOURE CHANGES FROM RUDDY TO PALOR PINK I SIT THERE AND SIT THERE AS IF SOME OTHER THING WILL NOW HAPPEN HE IS QUITE PALE AND I SEE THAT HE IS GONE FROM THIS WORLD I SIT HOLDING HIS HAND FOR A LONG TIME I GET UP AND WRAP MY ARMS AROUND HIM AND KISS HIS FOREHEAD AS IF HE IS MY BABY AT LAST GONE TO SLEEP AS IF HE IS MY BRAVE BOY GOING ON A LONG JOURNEY MILES AND MILES OF NAUGHT THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE TO DO THE LADIES WOULD LIKE ME TO GO BEFORE THE SWISS POLICE COME IT IS SIMPLER THEY SAY I DOESN'T FEEL THAT WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING ILLEGAL BUT I CAN TELL THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER PERHAPS BETTER FOR ME FOR DIGNITAS FOR ME TO NOT BE AROUND WHILE A SWISS POLICEMAN IDENTIFIES BRYAN'S BODY THAT'S WHAT HIS PASSPORT AND DENTLE RECORDS ARE FOR AS I UNDERSTAND IT I CALL AN UBER AND HUGGD THE LADIES I HID TO THE AIRPORT IN THE ZURIC AIRPORT I SIT IN THE FANCY LOUNDE AND I LOOK AROUND FOR FACES PEOPLE WATCHING SINCE THE MOMENT OF BRYAN'S DEATH I FIND MOST PEOPLE ESPECIALLY MEN DISGUSTING NOT JUST UNAPPEALING BUT DISGUSTING LIK YESTERDAY'S OATMEAL LIKED EELS IN A BOWL I FIND HETERO SEXUAL COUPLES DISMAYING IN THE LOUNGE I FEEL LIKE AN ALIEN EXAMINING PAIRS OF EARTHLANGS WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THAT HOW COULD A CREATURE LIKE

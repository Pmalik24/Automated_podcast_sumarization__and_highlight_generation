WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANSCIENCESCIENCEPACETOI MAN DRUWHUBERMAN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR PETER ATEA DOCTOR AT IS AF PHYSICIAN WHOSE FOCUST ON NUTRICIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION BASE BEHAVIORAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS THAT PROMOTE HEALTHSPAN AND LIFE SPAN HIS EXPERT SPANDS FROM EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY TO SLEEP PHYSIOLOGY EMOTIONAL IN MENTAL HEALTH AND PHARMICOLOGY TODAY WE TALK ABOUT ALL THOSE AREAS OF HEALTH STARTING WITH THE VERY BASIC SUCH AS HOW TO EVALUATE ONE'S OWN HEALTH STATUS AND HOW TO DEFINE ONE'S HEALTH TRAJECTORY WE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS SORTS OF INTERVENTIONS THAT ONE CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO OPTOMISE VITALITY WHILE ALSO EXTENDING LONGEVITY THAT IS LIFE SPAN DOCTOR ATAS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO FOCUST ON THE COMPLETE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF TOPICS THAT WE COVER AND INDEED THESE ARE THE SAME TOPICS THAT HE WORKS WITH HIS PATIENTS ON IN HIS CLINIC EVERY DAY DOCTORATEA EARNED HIS BACHELOR SCIENCE AN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND HIS EMDY FROM STAMPORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE HE THEN WENT ON TO TRAIN AT JOHN'S HOPKIN'S HOSPITAL IN GENERAL SURGERY ONE OF THE PREMERE HOSPITALS IN THE WORLD WHERE HE WAS THE RECIPIEN OF SEVERAL PRESTEGIOUS AWARDS INCLUDING RESIDENT OF THE YEAR HE'S BEEN AN AUTHOR ON COMPREHENSIVE VIEWS OF GENERAL SURGERY HE SPENT TWO YEARS OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AS A SURGICAL ONCOLOGY FELLOW AT THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE WHERE HIS WORK FOCUSTD ON A MU BASE THERAPIES FOR MELANOMA IN THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT WE ARE MUCH THE PRODUCT OF OUR MENTORS AND THE MENTERING WE RECEIVE DOCTOR ATA HAS TRAINED WITH SOME OF THE BEST AND MOST INEVATIVE LIPODOLOGISTS ENDER CHRONOLOGIST GYNACOLOGIST SLEEP PHYSIOLOGISTS AND LONGEVITY SCIENTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANDADA SO THE EXPERTST THAT FUNNELS THROUGH HIM AND THAT HE SHARES WITH US TO DAY IS REALLY HARNESSE FROM THE BEST OF THE BEST AND HIS EXTENSIVE TRAINING AND EXPERTICE BY THE END OF TODAYIS EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE ANSWERS TO IMPORTANT BASIC QUESTION SUCH AS SHOULD YOU HAVE BLOOD WORK HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU DO BLOOD WORK WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS SHOULD YOU BE LOOKING FOR ON THAT BLOOD WORK THAT ARE EITHER COUNTER INTUITIVE OR NOT OFTEN DISCUSST AND YET THAT IMMEDIATELY AND IN THE LONG TERM INFLUENCE YOUR LIFESPAN AND HEALTHSPAN WE TALK ABOUT HORMON HEALTH AND HORMONTHERAPIES FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WE TALK ABOUT DRUG THERAPEES THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE MIND AS WELL AS THE BODY ND OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION NUTRITION EXERCISE AND PREDICTORS OF LIFESPAN AND HEALHSPAN IT IS AN EPISODE RICH WITH INFORMATION FOR SOME OF YOU YOU MAY WANT TO GET OUT OF PEN AN PAPER IN ORDER TO TAKE NOTES FOR OTHERS OF YOU THAT LEARN BETTER SIMPLY BY LISTENING JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT WE HAVE TIMESTAMPED ALL THIS INFORMATION SO THAT YO CAN GO BACK TO THE SPECIFIC TOPICS MOST OF INTEREST TO YOU BEFORE HE BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STANFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZEROC OSS TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR OW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKHE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TOLECTOROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDR MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLITES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR PETER ATEA PETER THANKS FOR JOINING ME TO DAY THANKS FORHAVEIA THEN LOOKING FOR R TO THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME AM I HUGE FHANNING YOUR PODCAST I KNOW THAT YOU WENT TO STAMFORD AND WORKED WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COLLEGUES OF MIND SO FOR ME THIS IS ALREADY A THRILL JUST JUST BEDOING THIS ITLIKEWISE I'VE A TON OF QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO START OFF WITH SOMETHING I WONDER A LOT ABOUT AND THEN I KNOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WONDER AMOUT WHICH IS HOW TO ASSESS THEIR CURRENT HEALTH AND THEIR TRAJECTORY IN TERMS OF HEALTH AN WELL BEING SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO BLOOD WORK SWHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON BLOODWORK IS IT NECESSARY FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON SO THIS IS OMMEY WHOS NOT DEALING WITH SOMECUTE CINDRUM OR ILLNESS AND AT WHAT AGE WOULD YOU SUGGEST PEOPLE STARE GETTING BLOODWORK HOW FREQUENTLY SHOULD THEY GET BLOOD WORK HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET BLOODWORK DONE ET CETERA YOS LUK THERE N THE WAGTOCK ABOUT THIS OPATIENCE IS FIRST TAKE N EVERYTHING BACK TO THE OBJECTIVE SO WHAT WOULD IT WITS THE WHICH THE WHAT'S THE THING WE'RE TRYING TO OPTIMIZE SO IF IF A PERSON SAYS LOOK AND I'M TRYING TO BREAK TEN HOURS FOR AN IRON MAN IDON'T KNOW THAT BLOODWORK IS GOING TO BE A GAME CHANGING ASPECT OF THEIR TROJECTORY IN THEIR TRAINING AUNOTHER GON O BENTEM BENEFIT MUCH MORE FROM TUR FUNCTIONAL ANALISEES OF PERFORMANCE SO I'M ASSUMING BASE ON THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE REALLY COMING AT THIS THROUGH THE LENDS OF LIVING LONGER AND LIVING BETTER THROUGH THE LIFESPAN HEALTHSPAN MOST LENDS Y AND JUST I THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE SOME SENSE OF THEIR VITALITY OR LACK OF VITALITY BUT I THINK EVERYONE WONDERS WHETHER NOT THEY COULD FEEL BETTER IND WHETHER NOT BLOODWORK WILL GIVE THEM A WINDOW INTO HOW THEY MIGHT G ABOUT FEELING THATTER YE I THINK IT DOES TO SOME EXTENT BUT I ALSO THINK TH IT HAS A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS SO I CAN OF YOU KNOW BREAK THINGS DOWN INTO THE TWO VECTORS THAT MAKE UP LONGGEVITY WHICH AR LIFE SPAN IN HEALTH SPAN SO LIFE SPAN IS THE EASIEST OF THOSE VECTORS TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S IT'S UT'S PRETTY BINERY UT YOU'RE A LIVEOR YOU'RE NOT ALIVE YOU'RE RESPIRING OR YOU'R NOT YOU MAY C TP ERE YOU DON'T AND OF STORY SO A WHAT GETS IN THE WAY OF LIFE SPAN IS ESSENTIALLY THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF DISEASE RIGHT SO ATHROSCORODIC DISEASE CANCER NARRODYGENER OF DISEASE AND METABOLIC DISEASE WHICH DIRECTLY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF MANY DEATHS BUT YOU DON'T BE BE ASELY CRATES THE FOUNDATION TO ALL OF THOSE OTHER DISEASES AM SO YOU KNO IF YOU'RE A NON SMOKER WHAT I JUST RATTLE T OFFICE ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF YOUR DEATH SO HOW DOES BLOOD WORK HEALP ADDRESS THOSE IT VARIES SO ON THE ATHROSCORODIC STANDPOINT IT'S A VERY GOOD PREDICTOR OF RISK IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR A SO PRIMARILY APO B WOULD BE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT A LIPE A PROTINE THAT WE CARE ABOUT I GET EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS IN A SECOND AAND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW OTHER MARKERS OF INFLAMMATION AND ETHELIAL HEALTH AN METABOLIC HEALTH WHEN IT COMES TO CANCER YOU KNOW BLOOD TESTING IN THE SENSE OF BIOMARKERS IS NOT PARTICULARLY HELPFUL OUTSIDE OF KNOWING THAT THE SECOND LEEDING ENVIRONMENTAL OR MODIFIABLE CAUSE OF CANCER IS METABOLIC ILL HEALTH AFTER SMOKING SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW A LOT ABOUT CANCER IN THE SENSE OF WHAT CAUSE IS IT IT'S IT'S REALLY STARCASTIC AND IT'S A LOT OF BAD LUCK SO WE KNOW THAT SMOKING DRIVES IT AND WE KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH  EPI DONT EPIDIMUOLOGICALLY WE SAY OB CITY DRIVES IT WHAT  REALLY MEANS IS METABOLIC POOR HEALTH IT'S PROBABLY THE HYPER IN SLANEMIA THAT COMES WITH O BESE THAT DRIVES IT SO BIO MARKER'S HEALP WITH THAT BUT THERE STILL AN ENORMOUS BLIND SPOT TOC ANSWER WE COULD TALK ABOUT LIQUID BIOBSES SIDE CAUSE THOSE AREN'T REALLY BIOMARKER STUDIES BUT BUT THAT AWAY ON THE NOURE DEGENERF DESIDE YOU I DO'T THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF INSIGHT THAT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING PARKINSIN'S DISEASE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DIMENSIA PARTICULARLY ALSIMERS DISEASE WHICH IS THE MOST PREVALENT FORMA DIMENTIA I THINK THE BAMARKERS CAN BE QUITE HEALPFUL THEY OVERLAP A LOT WITH THE ATHROSCORODIC DISEASES SO THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU KNOW DRIVE THE RISK OF HART DISEASE ARE DRAWING DRAWING DRIVING THE RISK OF DEMENSIO  AND THEN THERE'S SOME NOVEL STUFF AS WELL IF YOU INCLUDE GENETIC TESTING WHICH YOU CAN GET OUT OF A BLOOD TEST WE GET A WHOLE SWEET OF GEANS NOT JUST APO E BUT FAR MORE YOU KNOW KNEW ON STUFF THAN THAT THAT CAN ALSO PLAYE ROLL SO YOU CAN STRATIFY RISK IN THAT SENSE SO IN AGGREGATE I WOULD SAY YOU KOW' BLOOD TESTING O BIOMARKERS PROVIDES PRETTY GOOD INSIGHT INTO LIFE SPAN WHEN YOU GET INTO HEALTH'SPAND YOU HAVE KIND OF THE COGNITIVE PHYSICAL MOTIONAL DEMAINS I THINK HERE THE THE BIOMARKERS ARE FAR LESS HEALPFUL AND HERE WE CAN AVE RELY MORE ON FUNCTIONAL TESTING SO WHEN IT COMES TO SORT OF THE COGNITIVE PIECE YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO COGNITIVE TESTING WIN TERMS OF LONG TERM RISK A OT OF THE THINGS THAT IMPLY GOOD COGNITIV HEALTH IS YOU AGE IM ARE IN LINE WITH THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU WOULD DO TO REDUCE THE RISK OF DIMENSION SO ALL THE BIO MARKERS THAT YOU WOULD LOOK TO IMPROVE THROUG DIMENSA RISK PRODUCTION YOU WOULD BE IMPROVING THROUGH COGNITIVFE HEALT ON THE PHYSICAL SIDE MEAN OUTSIDE OF LOOKING AT HORMON LEVELS AND THINGS WHICH WE LOOK AT EXTENSIVELY AN UNDERSTANDING HOW THOSE MIGHT I'M AID IN OR PREVENT SOME OF THE METRICS THAT MATTER IT REALLY IS THISIS A BI MARKER ASIDE THING I MEAN I'D BE MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN A PERSON'S DECTS A SEE PAT TESTING VI TWO MAXTESTING YOU KNOW SON TO LACTATE TESTING FATOXIDATION THOSE WHAT I CONCIERN MORE FUNCTIONAL TESTS THAT GIVE ME FAR MORE INSIGHT INTO THAT AND THN OF COURSE THE EMOTIONAL PIECE WHICH DEPENDING ON YOU KOW WHO YOU ARE MIGHT BE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE WITHOUT WHICH NONE OF THIS OTHER STUFF MATTERS OR IF YOUR TOTALLY MISERABLE HUMAN BEING YOURE RELATIONSHIP SUCK O OL LY GN THIS OTHER STUFF MATTERS AND CERTAINLY THERE'S NOTHING THAT I'M LOOKING AT IN BIO MARKERS THAT'S GIVING ME GREAT INSIDE INTO THAT DO YOU ASK ABOUT EMOTIONAL STATE WOULD YOU TRY NTO SESS A MOTIONAL STATE IN DIRECTLY WHEN YOU DOAN IN TAKE WITH ONE ING YOU PATIENCE I'M PROBABLY NOT SO MUCH IN THE INTAKE BECAUSE I THINK IT TAKES A WHILE TO FORMER RELATIONSHIP WITH A PATIENT BEFORE THAT STARTS TO BECOME SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE NECESSARILY CAN WANT A TALK WITH YOU ABOUT BUT I DEFINITELY THINK OF IT AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO AND I THINK WITHOUT IT NONE OFTHIS OTHER STUFF REALLY MATTERS AGAIN THE IRONY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW MANY YEARS I SPEND SORT OF INPURSUIT OF FULLY OPTIMIZING EVERY DETAIL OF EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY ATTENTION BEING PAID TO THAT DIMENSION IS NOT LOST ON ME AND AND LOOK THERE ARE SOME PATIENCE WHO THEY THAT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S COMPARTMENTALIZED MAYBE THERE OTHER THEY'RE DOING WELL ON THE DEPARTMENT MAY BE THEY AREN'T BUT THEY JUST AREN'T WILLING TO ENGAGE ON THAT YET JUMS OF FREQUENCY O BLOOD TESTING IF SOMEBODY FEELS PRETTY GOOD IM AND IS TAKING A NUMBER OF STEPS EXERCISE NUTRITION ET CETERA TO TRY IND EXTEND LIFE SPAND AND IMPROVE HELL SPEND IM IS ONCE A YEAR FREQUENT ENOUGH IM AND SHOULD A TWENTY YEAR OLD STAR GETTING BLOOD WORK DONE JUST TO GET A WINDOW INTO WHAT'S GOING ON ASSUMING THAT THEY CAN AFFORD ANYER THEIR ASSURANCE CAN COVERY I MEANT LOOK I I CERTAINLY THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE SCREENED EARLY IN LIFE BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK IT LIKE WHAT'S THE SINGLE MOST PREVALENT GENATIC DRIVER OF ATHROSGOROSIS IS ELPY LITTLE AY SO UNFORSUNLY MOST PHYSICIANS DON'T KNOW WHAT ELL PE LITTLE I IS AND YET IUN A SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS A HIGH ENOUGH AND DEPENDING ON WHO YOU YOU KNOW AI HAD A RECENT GUESS ON MY PODCAST TO SUGGEST THAT IT COULD BE AS HIGH AS TWENTY PER CENT HAVE A HIGH ENOUGH ELPY LITTLEAY THAT IT IS CONTRIBUTING TO ATHROS GOROSIS SO TO NOT WANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN IT'S GENATICALLY DETERMINED RIT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNW YOU'RE YOU'RE BORN WITH THIS AND YOU ONLY NEED TO REALLY CHECK AT ONCE WHY WE WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT IN A TWENTY YEAR OLD WHEN IT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A LOT OF THE EARLY ATHROSCOROSIS WE SEE IN PEOPLE AYOU NO IJUST ITSINO IT'S LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE IN MY INION THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH YOU NEED TO TEST REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE STATE OF INTERVENTIONS YOU KNOW I I DON'T THINK IT MAKE SENSE TO JUST DO BLOOD TESTS FOR THE SAKE OF DOING BLOOD TESTS THERE HAS TO BE KIND OF A REASON IS SOMETHING CHANGING IM YOU KNOW A BLOOD TEST IS FOR THE MOST PART OFSTATIC INTERVENTION IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S A LOOK AT A WINDOW IN TIME AND THERE'S BENEFIT IN HAVING YOU KNOW A FEW OF THOSE OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR IF YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT A LEVEL SO SOMETHING COMES BACK AND IT DOESN'T LOOK GREAT YET MIGHT MAKE SENSE JUST TO RECHECK IT WITHOUT REACTING TO IT BUT TYPICALLY YOU KNON IMPATIENCE WE MIGHT CHECK BLOOD TWO TO FOUR TIMES A YEAR BUT WERE LSO PROBABLY DOING THINGS IN THEIR TO TO NOW CHECK LIKE HAY YOU KOW WE  GAVE THIS DRUG DID IT HAVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME IM YOU KNOWYOU PUT ON THREE POUNDS OF MUSCLE AND LOST THREE POUNDS OF FACT DID IT HAVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME I SPEAKING OF TRACKING WEIGHT AND IM FAT MEAN MASS PER CENGES THATS SOMETHING A OU RECOMMEND YOUR PATIENTS YOU PRETTY OFTEN I DON'T PEOPLE AT STEP ON THE SCALE EVERY DAY AND NOT PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT I MIGHT STEP ON THE SCALE THREE TIMES YOU'RE ONLY CARE CARE I PAY ATTENTION TO OTHER THINGS AT ARE FAR MORE SUBJECTIVE MAYBE I' MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE WHAT REYOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT IM QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF WAIT A BE AM I A FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON I THINK THEY'RE PRETTY CRUDE IM I THINK A DECKS I I'D RATHER TAKE A DECXA ANNUALLY IM AND THEN MAYBE FALL O WEIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY TO GET A SENSE OF IT AND SO WITH A DECKSAT YOU'RE GETTING AT LEAST THE WAY WE LOOK AT THE DATE A FOUR PIECES OF INFORMATION NOW MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY DO A DECK A SHOULD I EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS  I THINK SOME PEOPLE I NOT KNOW AT DECKS IS I IN FACT I CONFESS I HAVE CRUDE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS IM MY TELL ME OF WHERE I'M WRONG AND IM POPLY WERE I'N PART LEAST PARTIALLY RIGHT MYNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE'RE NUMBER DIFFERENT WAYS TO MEASURE LEAN MASS TO NONLY MASS RATIO AND THE THERE'S ONE WHERE THEY PUT YOU UNDER WATER YHERE'S ONE WHERE THEY PUT YOU INTO SOME SORT OF NON UNDER WATER CHAMBER THERE'S CALLIPERING AND THEN THERE'S THE UM LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AND NAM PINCHING IN AND NOW CHANGING THE LIGHTING THE E IT'S FUNNY WIF YOU'V IF YOU'VE DONE IT ENOUGH YOU CAN I CAN SORT OF TELL MY BODY FAT BY MY ABS RIGHT SO I CAN SORT OF TELL BY YOU KNOW HOW GOOD THE SIX PACK OR HOW BAD THE SIX PACK IS WHAT THE LEANNESS IS AND THAT'S THAT'S ECTUALLY NOT A TERRIBLE AWAY TO DO IT THER R BEU N A BODY BUILDER FOR EXAMPLE WHICH I'VE NEVER BEEN CAN CAN TELL YOU THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING SIX PER CENT SEVEN PER CENT EIGHT PER CENT TEN PER CENT JUST BASED ON THE DEGREE OF VISIBILITY WITHIN WITHIN THE ABS M BUT BASICALLY A DECXA SCAN IS AN EX RAY SO IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS YOU HAVE JUST GETTING A CHESTEXS RAY WHERE IONIZING RADIATION IS PASS THROUGH THE BODY AND THERE'S A PLATE BEHIND THE BODY THAT COLLECTS WHAT COMES THROUGH AND THEY'RE THE DENSIR THE MMEDIUM THAT THE BLACK TRUNS ARE TRYING TO GO THROUGH THE LESS OF THEM THAT ARE COLLECTED SO WHEN YOU LOOK IT AN EX RAY S EVERYBODY'S PROBABLY SEEN AN NEXT RAY THAT WHICH IS WHITE IS MOST DENSE SO IF YOU HAD N A PIECE OF METAL IN YOUR POCKET IT WOULD SHOW UP AS A BRIGHT WHITE THING THAT'S WHY RIBS AND BONES SHOW UP AS WHITE AND THE THINGS THAT ARE THE LEAST DENSE LIKE THE LUNGS WHERE IT'S JUST AIR ARE THE BLACKEST AND EVERYTHING IS A SHADE OF GRAY IN BETWEEN SO A DEXA IS JUST DOING THAT EFFECTIVELY BUT IT'S A MOVING EX RAY SO YOU LAY DOWN ON A BED AND IT TAKES MAY BE TEN MINUTES AND THIS LITTLE VERY LOW POWER EXRAY COUNT OF GOES OVER YOUR BODY AND THE PLATE BENEATH IT IS IS COLLECTING INFORMATION THAT IS BASICALLY ALLOWING IT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THREE THINGS BONE MINERAL CONTENT FAT OTHER AND THE OTHER IS QUANTIFIED AS LEAN BODY MASS SO THAT'S ORGANS MUSCLES EVERYTHING ELSE SO WHEN MOST PEOPLE DO A DEXS OF THE THE YOUOW TO GET THE REPORT BACK AND THE REPORTS ARE HORRIBLE AT I'VE YET TO SEE ONE COMPANY THAT CAN DO THIS IN A WAY THAT ISN'T ABJECTLY HORRIBLE WE WE'VE CRATED OUR OWN TEMPLATES SO WE HAVE OUR OWN DASHBORD FOR HOW WE DO THIS AS WEVE JUST GIVEN UP ON TRYING TO USE THEIRS BUT THE FIRST THING MOSTPEOPLE LOOK AT IS WHATS MY BODY FAT AND THIS IS THE GOLD STANDARD OUTSIDE OF LIKE EMORI OR SOMETHING THAT'S ONLY USED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSIS SO SO A DEXA IS GOING TO PRODUCE A FAR BETTER ESTIMATE OF A BODY FAT THAN CALIPERS OR A BUOYANCY TESTING OR THINGS LIKE THAT PROVIDED THE MACHINERY IS WELL CALIBRATED AND THE OPERATOR KNOWS HOW TO USE IT A I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT IN THE HANDS OF LIKE THE GUY WHO'S BEEN DOING CALIPERS HIS WHOLE LIFE IT CAN PROBABLY BE COMPARABLE WITH CALIPERS BUT NEVERTHELESS FOR AN OFF THE SHEL TEC DECXAS AMAZING YOU KNOW OF THE FOUR THINGS THAT GET SPIT OUT OF THE DECK O WE THINK THAT THE BODY FAT IS THE LEAST INTERESTING AND SO I WOULD RANK THAT IS FORTH ON THE LIST OF WHAT'S GERMAIN TO YOUR HEALTH THE OTHER THREE THINGS THAT YOU GET SPIT OUT ARE BONE MINERAL DENSITY AVISTERAL FAT AND THEN THE MECTRICS THAT ALLOW YOU TO COMPUT A TO SUBASICALLY COMPU WHAT'S CALLED APPENDICULAR LEAN MASS INDEXS AND FAT FREE MASS AND DECTS AND SO THOSE THREE METRICS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN BODY FAT AND THE REASON IS AS FALL IS RIGHT SO SO BONE MINERAL DENSITY BASICALLY SPEAKS TO YOUR RISK OF OSTIAL PAROSIS A AN OSTIOPENIA AAND THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY SEXY TO PEOPLE OUR AGE YOU KNOW FIFTY YEAR OLD GUIES LISTENING TO THIS IT'S LIKE A BIG DEAL BUT FOR IF FIFTY YEAR OLD WOMAN IS A HUGE DEAL RIGHT A WOMAN WHO'S JUST ABOUT TO GO THROUGH MENOPAS OR HAS JUST GONE THROUGH MANOPAUS IS IT AN ENORMOUS RISK FOR OSTIOPENIA AND AND THEN ULTIMATELY OSTIAL PAROSIS BECAUSE ESTROGEN IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT HORMONE IN REGULATING BONE MINERAL DENSITY AAND WE CAN COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT WHY THAT'S THE CASE BUT IT'S IT'S VERY INTERESTING HOW THE HOW THE BIO MECHANICS OF OF A BONES WORK AND WHY ESTROGEN SPECIFICALLY IS SO IMPORTANT AND THIS IS A HUGE CAUSE OF MORBIDITY RIGHT SO YOU KOW WITH YOUR OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE AND YOU FALL AND BREAK YUR HIP YOUR ONE YEAR MORBIDITY IS ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT HICH YOU GAN JUST PUT THAT IN ENGLISH YOU'RE SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER YOU FALL AND BREAK YOUR HIP THERE'S A THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT CHANTS YOUR DEAD ANY YOAR WELL BONES MATTER UM SO WE WANT TO REALLY GET A SENSE OF WHERE YOU STACK UP FOR YOUR AGE FOR YOUR SEX AND IF YOU'RE ANYWHERE OFF THE PACE WE HAVE TO RAMP UP OUR STRATEGY AND BE SUPERAGRESSIVE ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE THAT OR AN EMINIMUM PREVENT ANY FURTHER DECAY AND ARE THERE AGE RELATE CHARTS FOR THER SORTS OF THINGS YET THIS IS THIS ALL GET SPIT OUT INTO WHAT'S CALLED A ZEESCORE SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR THE EMD IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A ZEASCOURSE WAS ZEASCORE OF ZERO MEANS AD YOU UNDERSTAND THIT'S BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S RE ZEASCORE REFERRING TO A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION IN A STANDARD MODE SO ZEESCORE OF ZERO MEANS YOU'RE THE FIFTIETH PER CENTILE FOR YOUR AGE AND SEX AS ZEASCORE OF PLUS ONE YOU'RE ONCETINDEDEVIATION ABOVE MIN US ONE BELOW ET CETERA U THERE'S ALSO A TEA SCORE WHICH IS DOING THE SAME THING BUT COMPARING YOU TO A YOUNG PERSON AND SO THE TEASCORE IS TECHNICALLY USED TO MAKE THE DIAGNOS OF OSTOPINAOSTIC PROCESS WE D WE TEND TO LOOK MORE AT THE ZEASCORE AND BASICALLY SAY LOOK IF YOU'RE ZEESCORE RIGHT NOW AS MIN US ONE IN FOUR YEARS I WANT YOUR ZEASCORET TO BE ZERO NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE YOU'VE INCREASED THAT ENTIRE WAY BUT MAYBE OU'VE INCREASE SLIGHTLY WILE IT'S EXPECTED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE DECLINED I SEE WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DOU TO IMPROVE BONEMINEROLTHENSITY AT ANY AGE SO IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A REAL CRITICAL WINDOW IN WHICH WE ARE MALLEABLE SO DEPENDING ON THE AGE AT WHICH SOME ONE'S LISTENING TO US DISCUSS THIS UM YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE UNDER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YOU ARE STILL IN THAT TIME OF YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO REACH YOUR POTENTIAL SO UM IT TURNS OUT THAT STRENGTH TRAINING IS PROBABLY THE SINGLE BEST THING YOU CAN DO AND THIS WAS A SURPRISE TO ME CAUSE WE YOU KNOW WE DID IN A M A ON THIS TOPIC A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND THAT'S WHEN I GOT OU NA REALLY DEEP ON THIS WITH OUR ANALISTS MY ASSUMPTION WAS A RUNNING MUST BE THE BEST LIKE SOME SORT OF IMPACT MUST BE THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS OU I ASSUMED RUNNING WOULD BE BETTER THAN SWIMMING IN CICLING BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT POWER LIFTING WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THING YOU CALD DO UM AN I THINK ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW BONES WORK IT BECAME MORE CLEAR WHICH IS OU NOW POWER LIFTING IS REALLY PUTTING MORE OF A SHEER FORCE FROM THE MUSCLE VE A THE TENDANT ON TO THE BONE AND THAT'S WHAT THE BONES ARE REALLY SENSING THERE SENSING THAT SHEER FORCE ITS BEING APPLIVE THROUGH THE BONE IN INA COMPRESSIVE WAY DEPENDING ON THE BONE OF COURSE AND THAT'S WHAT'S BASICALLY ACTIVATING THE OSTEOL BLASTS WHICH SOR THE CELLS THAT ARE YOU KNOW A ALLOWING BONE TO BE BUILT SO IT'S THIS IS THIS TURNS OUT TO BE PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT FOR FEMALES UM BECAUSE HOW IH YOU CAN GET DURING THAT PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT SAY TILL YOU'R TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE BASICALLY SETS YOUR TROJECTORY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVE SO WERE WE GET INTO REAL TROUBLE IS WITH PATIENCE WHO FOR EXAMPLE USED LARGE AMOUNTS OF IN HAT IN HAILED STEROIDS DURING THAT PERID O THOIR LIFE CAS THAT SAY THEY HAD REALLY BAD ASMA WERE PATIENTS WHO NEEDED LARDS AMOUNTS OF CORTIFOSTEROIDS FOR SOME OTHER REMUNE RELATED CONDITION SO DURING THEIR CRITICAL WINDOW OF DEVELOPMENT THEY WERE TAKING A DRUG THAT WAS IMPAIRING THIS PROCESS SO YOU NOW WE HAVE SOME PATIENTS LIKE THAT IN OUR PRACTISE AND THAT'S YOU NOVE JUST AN ENORMOUS LIABILITY THAT WERE WORKING REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME YOU NOW WITH NUTRITION WITH HORMONES WITH DRUGS WITH TRAINING IM AND YOU KOW IT'S YOU KNOWT JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF I WASN'T AWARE THAT IM YOINHALMENTS A FOR ASHMO AN THINKS THAT SORT CAN IMPAIR ON MEERAL DENSITY OW THERES STAIRROID BASE S SOME OF THEM OF COURSE ARE JUST BATO AGONISTS AND THEIR FINE SO ANYTHING CORTICA STERON WHY USINK AND THEN ALWAYS GET ASKE THIS QUESTION AND AN I ALWAYS REFLECTIBLY WANT TO SAY NO WHAT I DON' REALLY KNOW THE ANSWERS I DON'T REPLY HAT ABOUT TOPICAL AM CORTICASTERO YOU OW' PEOPLE PUT CORT HIS OWN CREAM TO ME IT SEEMS ALMOST INT CONCEIVABLE THAT THED HAVIS OSTEMAC EFFECT BUT THEN AGAIN WHEN WI NOW IT'S ALL IT'S ALL DOSE AND IT'S ALL THOST AND IN TIME RELATED SO YOU NO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE I'VE GOT A LITTLE RASH UNDER MY SKIN OMEN TO PUT YOU KNOW CORTICASTARITS ON PROBABLY NOT IM BUT BUT CERTAINLY WITH ENOUGH OF IT PUT ON A MEN IT IS ABSORBED SO IM IT COULD BE IN ISSUE BUT THAT'S NOT TIMICALLY WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH HEM AN WE'RE MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH PEOPLE THAT AR YOU KNOW TAKING EVEN MODEST AMOUNTS OF PRETIN IS OWN FOR MONTHS YEARS AT A TIME I'M MORE LIKE I SAID KIDS THAT ARE USING STEROID IN HAILORS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS EAN I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT IF YOUR KIDS ON ASTERIT AN HAILOR THEY SHOULDN'T BE YOU HAVE TO SOLVE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM IN IF ASMAASTHE MOST PORNT PROMIS SO BE  THINK YOU JUST WANT A TURN THAT INTO CEY WELL HOW MUCH MORE IMPERATIVE IS IT THAT OUR KID IS DOING THINGS THAT ARE PUTTING A HIGH AMOUNT OF STRESS ON THEIR BONES AND THE OTHER MUSCLES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IN THAT MAXIMAL CAPACITY TO BUILD YOU THINK THAT SOMEBODY IN THERE THIRTIES OR FORTEAS OR FIFTIES COULD STILL BENEFIT FROM STRAIN TRAINING IN TERMS OF BONE MINERAL DENSITY IN LONCHEVITY IM AS A RELATES TO BONMERAL DENSITY I GIVEN THAT THERE'S THIS KEE WINDOW EARLIER R THEY MIGHT AVE MISS THAT OH YE NO THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE REST OF LIFE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOW TRYING TO PREVENT THE FALL OFF SO SO BASELY THE WAY AT WORKS IS YOU YOUR SORT OF FROM FROM BIRTH TO SAY TWENTY YEAR ON YOU'RE IN GROWTH FROM TWENTY TO FIFTY YOU PLATEAO AT FIFTY MEN START TO DECLINE BUT IT'S REALLY SMALL WOMEN START TO DECLINE IN ITS PRECIPITOUS IT'S RELATED TO THE DROP AN ESTRGIN JESTER WITH MANAPAS ORPREMANOPAUS AND AND CAN WE GET INTO ANY OF THE BROAD A CONTOURS OF OF WHAT THAT STRAIT TRAINING LOOKS LIKE WE HAD AIN'T DOCTOR ANY GALOPING ON THE SHOW TALKED A LOT ABOUT WAYS TO BUILD STRAIN FORS AS I PERTOFEVERS ENDURANCE ET CETERA THINK THERE'S PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT CROSS THE FIELDS OF YOU KNOW YSE OTHERAPY ET CETERA O PHYSIOLOGY IN AN MEDICINE TERMS OF HOW TO DO THAT BA MANERSTENDING IS FAIRLY LOW RE PETITION RANGES SO THAS S ANYWHERE FROM ONE TOS SIX REPETITIONS TIPICALE NOT NING FOR YOU KNOW A POMPIPERTROPHY THAT SORT OF THING BUT HEAVY LOADS THAT ARE HARD TO MOVE EI EIGHTY PER CENT OF ONE REPETITION MAXIMUM OR MORE DONE WITH LONG REST PERIODS IM THE RE TOODO YOU THREE TIMES O WEA TIHT THINGS THAT ABOUT RAIFE YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON THIS IT'S GIN O TELL YOU IT'S GET A DIFFERENTIATE POWER LIFTING FROM WEIGHT LIFTING IN OTHER WORDS YET YOU DO NEED TO BE KIND OF MOVING AGAINST A VERY HEAVY LOAD NOW AGAIN THAT CAN LOOK VERY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON YOUR LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE LIKE I REALLY LIKE DEAD LIFTING NOW I MEAN I CAN COUNT THE NUMBER OF DAYS LEFT IN MY LIFE WHEN I'M GOING TO WANT O TOU SATS OVER FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS BUT YOU KNOW I'LL PICK AN CHOOSE THE DAYS THAT I DO BUT BUT YOU KNOW I GREW UP DOING THOSE THINGS I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE MOVEMENTS IF I HAD A SIXTY YEAR OLD WOMEN WHOSE NEVER LIFTED WEIGHTS IN HER LIFE WHO WE NOW HAVE TO GET LIFTING I MEAN WE COULD GET HER TO DEAD LIFT BUT THINK I WOULDN'T MAKE YOU KNOW PERFECT THE ENEMY OF GOOD I'D BE HAPPY TO PUT HER ON A LEG PRESS MACHINE AND JUST GET HER DOING THAT IM YOU KNW IT'S NOT AS PURE A MOVEMENT AS A DEAD LIFF BUT WHO CARES RIGHT WE CAN STILL PUT HER AT A HEAVY LOAD FOR HER AND DO SO SAFELY SO IM NOW THAT' SAD I MEAN THERE IS A STUDY IT WAS DONE IN AUSTRALIA IM YOU KNOW HOPE WL WE CAN FIND OU  LINTH TO IT IT'S THERE'S A VIDIO ON YOU TO THAT ACTUALLY KIND OF HAS THE P EYE FORT OF WALKING THROUGH THE RESULT I CAN SEND IT TO YOU  YE AND IT'S IT'S JUST AMAZING YET THEY TOOK A GROUP OF YOU KNW OLDER WOMEN THEY LOOK LIKE THERE IN THEIR SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES WHO HAD NEVER LIFTED WEGHTS IN THEIR LIFE WHO YOU KNOW HAD OSTIOPENIA AND SOME PROBABLY ALREADY HAD OFSIO PAROSIS AND THEY MASE WE JUST PUT THEM ON A STRENGTH TRAINING PROTO CALL AND IT IS REMARKABLE TO WATCH THESE WOMEN THY'RE DOING GOOD MORNINGS THEYRE DO WING DEAD LEFTS THERE PICKING HEAVY THINGS UP OFF THE GROUND IN THINK ONE WOMAN WAS PICKING UP I WANT TO SAY SHE WAS LIKE PICKING LIKE FIFTY SIXTY KEYLOWS UP OFF THE GROUND MEAN JUST STAGGERING SUMS OF WEIGHT FOR THESE WOMENWHO HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING AND THEIR BONE HEALTH IS IMPROVING AT THIS AGE SO IM THE GOAL FRANKLY IS TO JUST YOU KNOW NEVER GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU KNOW STRENGTH TRAINING IS SUCH AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR EXISTENCE THAT IM YOU KNOW THERE'S NOUNIT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO START BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER STOP OF THAT ADVICE IS IT A ASTEMIC OFFACT OR A LOCAL EFFACT SO FOR INSTANCE IM LET'S SAY THAT WELL MY MOTHERIS IN HER LATE SEVENTIES IM SHET SHE'S TO BE REALLY STRONG WHEN WERE GET SHE COULD MOVE THIS FISH TANK THAT WAS IN MY ROOM LONG BEFORE I COULD MOVE IT AND NUM  SHE'S REALLY STRONG OVER THE YEARS IM I WOULD I WOULDN'T CALL HER FRAIL BY ANY MEANS BUT I CERTAINLY THINK SHE COUL BENEFIT FROM SOME STRANGTH TRAINING LET'S SAY SHE WERES O START DOING SOME LEG PRESSES OR START EVEN WITH EIR SQUADS AND MAY BE WORK UP TO SOME PUSHOUPS THE EFFECT'S ALL LOCAL MEANING IF SHE WERE TO JUST TRAIN HER LEGS OR JUST DO PUSH OUPS IM WOULD ONLY BE THE LOADS APPLIED TO THE LIMBSON AND MUSCLES IN TISHES THN WER HAV LONG THAT'S WHERE THE BULK OF IT IS YEOHYES SO YOU NEED TO TRAIN THE WHOLE BODY ESSENTIALLY YE NOW KEEP IN MIND THE DIAGNOSIS OF OSTOPAENIA AND OSTE PAROSIS IS BASED ON ONLY THREE LOCATIONS THE LEFT HIPPE THE RIGHT HIPP IN THE LUMBAR SPINE SO I'M YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST THE CONVENTION BY WHICH WE MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS AND AND I THINK PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY HE INSULTS OCCUR NOW NOT ALL OF THE INSULTS I'VE SEEN PEOPLE THAT OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF HORRIBLE BONE DENSITYEITHER THER OU NOTHER FRACTURIN ANKLES AND TIBIA FIBULA LIKE THEIRE HAVING LOW TIB FIB FRACTURES JUST WALKING I'M SO CLEARLY BONE DENS THE OUTSIDE OF THOSE REGIONS DOES MATTER BUT MUCH OF IT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON AND BY THE WAY  FALL YOU BREAK A WRIST SO SO THIS IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE I'M BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESPONSE IS A LOCAL RESPONSE CAUSE IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO PUTTING A LOW DIRECTLY ON THAT BONE AND THEN HAVING THAT BONE IN KIND RESPOND I LAYING DOWN MORE BONE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ITHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITAMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SO AM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH IR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ATS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBATICS ANATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ITHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE GRIPE IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS

YOU MENTION FALLING AND THE PROBLEMS WITH FALLING AND BREAKING THINGS AND MORTALITY RELATED TO THAT I WONDER WHETHER NOT THERE ARE ALSO AM HEALTH RELATED EFFECTS HAVE JUST HAVING WEEK BONES THAT ARE NOT JUST ABOUT FALLING AND BREAKING A BONE AND DYING A YEAR LATER EVEN THAT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY SEVERE I'M BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE WILL HEARE ABOUT THAT SOME YOU MIGHT THINK WELL ETT JUS BE MORE CAREFUL TERS ME MORE SLOWLY I'LL SIT IN A WHEEL CHAIR IF I NEED TO IF A EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT BE ABLE WALK THAES WEFALLING SOME PEOPLE THINK ADOPT THAT MENTALITY WONDER SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING IM HI BONE MINERAL DENSITY FOR MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE PERHAPS INDEPENDENT OF RISK OF INJURY Y THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THE INVERSE OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID RIGHT IT'S SORT OF LIKE YOU HAFE THE SORT OF BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE WHAT IT IS YOU WANT IN YOUR MARGINAL DECADE SO WE WE USE THIS THING IN OUR PRACTICE CALLED THE MARGINAL DECADE MARGINAL DECAT IS LAST DECADE OF YOUR LIFE SO EVERY ONE WILL HAVE A MARGINAL DECADE THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN TELL YOU WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY I I BELIEVE YOU THERE'S NO INMENTALITY THERE'S NO HID IN THE LIKE SIR THAT'S GOING TO HELP US LIVE TO BE YOU KNOW WHATEVER I MEAN WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE IN OUR LAST DECADE AT SOME POINT I'M AN OUTSIDE OF PEOPLE WHO DIE SUDDENLY YOUR THROUGH AN ACCIDENT I'M MOST OF US KNOW WHEN WE'RE N THAT MARGINAL DECADE YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THE DAY YOU ENTER IT BUT MOST PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH IF YOU TELL THEM ARE YOU IN THE LAST DECADE OF YOUR LIFE THEY PROBABLY HAVE A SENSE THAT THEY ARE SO I THINK THE EXERCISE THAT WE LIKE TO GO THROUGH WITH OUR PATIENTS VERY EARLY ON IS HAVE THEM IN EXQUISITE DETAIL MORE DETAIL THAN THEY'VE EVER CONSIDERED WE HAVE TO PROMPT THEM WITH LIKE FIFTY QUESTIONS I'M LAY OUT WHAT THEIR MARGINAL DECADE SHOULD LOOK LIKE WELL THAT'S A SERIOUS EXERCISES A VERY SERIOUS EXERCISE RIGHT LIKE WHAT TELL ME EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN YOUR MARGINAL DECADE I DON'T NOW WHAN IT'S GOING TO BE UNDER IT COULD BE EIGHTY SEVEN TO NINETY SEVEN IF WE'RE DOING WELL RIGHT IT MIGHT BE SEVENTY NINE TO EIGHTY NI I DON'T KNOW BUT I YOU KNOW WE WOULD REALLY BE IN A VERY NEW ANCE EXPLORATION OF THAT TOPIC AND I THINK UNTIL YOU DO THAT ALL THIS OTHER STUFF IS JUST ABSTRACT AND KIND OF NONSENSE YOU KOW UNTIL A PERSON CAN TELL YOU WHAT IT IS THAT THEY WANT TO BE DOING IN THAT LAST DECADE YOU CAN'T DESIN A PROGRAME TO GET THEM THERE I MEANT THINK ABOUT IT YOU SOME ONE WANTS TO DO AN IRON MAN WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE OBJECTIVE IS I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SWIM TWO AN A HALF MILES IFT WE ABLE TO GET OUT TAKE MY WET SUIT OFF HOP ON MY BIKE RIDE A HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILES GET OFF MY BIKE TAKE THE BIKE SHOOTS OFF PUT THE RUN SHOS ON RUN TWENTY SPWENT TWO MILES  WE GET IT WE KNOW WHAT THE OBJECTIVE IS AND ONLY BY KNOWING THAT CAN YOU TRAIN CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID TO YOU AND I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU DO AN ATHLETIC EVENT IN A YEAR START TRAINING I MGHT NOT TELL YOU WHAT IT IS JUST DO IT COULD BE PLAYING BASKET BALL ITYOU KNOW IT COULD BE SWIMMING TO CATTALINA ISLAND IT COULD BE RUNNING A HUNDRED MILES YOU WOULDNT MEABLY DO IT SO SIMILARLY IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR MARGINAL DECADE IS MEANT TO BE THERE'S NO WAY TO TRAIN FOR IT YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD EXERCISE FOR ANYONE AN EVERYONE DID YOU ON THEIR OWN REGARDLESS AN AGE HERE I'M HEARING TIS ANI WTHINKING I MEAN TO THINK ABOUT WHEN MY LAST DECADE MIGHT BE IN WHAT I WANT THAT TO LOOK LIE ABSOLUTELY I MAN WHEN I SAY WE DO WITH OUR PATIENTS THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THT'S THE POPULATION IT WORK WITH BUT THERE'S SIMPLY NO REASON EVERYBODY SHOULDN'T BE GOING THROUGH THIS EXERCISE AND THEN YOU YOU'S SORT OF BAXSCRIPT FROM THERE YOUN GROUT WHAT WE WI SHOU YOUN WING  ET IN OUR CURRENT HELSTAT ITS EXACTLY WHAT WE CALL IT BACKCASTING SO THE FIRST STEP WE DO IS ONCE WE'VE REALLY DELINEATED WHAT THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION LOOKS LIKE WE THEN SAY OCE HOW DO YOU BREAK DOWN THAT INTO A METRICS THAT WE CAN MEASURE SO YOUKNOW YOU DESCRIBE DOING A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS RANT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW TO DO THAT WE'LL REQUIRE A VEO TWO MACS OF THIRTY MILLY LEADERS OF OXYGEN PERMITIT PER KILEGRAM NTHE PERSONWALL SAY OGAY WHAT DOES THAT ME WE'LL SAY WELL THAT'S A MEASURE OF YOUR MAXIMAL UPTAKE OF OXYGEN AND THAT DECLINES AT ABOUT EIGHT PER CENT TO TEN PER CENT PERDECADE SO IF YOU HAVE TO BE AT THIRTY UNLESS YOUS ASSUME YOU'REGING TO BE DOING THAT AT NINETY SO WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE AT EIGHTY SEVENTY SIXTY FIFT YOC HEARES WHAT IT WOULD NEED TO BE AT FIFTY OKET WHAT ARE YOU NOW AH THERE'S A BIG GAP YOU'RE BELOW WHERE YOU NEED TO BE NU SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY HIGHER THAN THIRTY NOW BUT IF YOU'RE ONLY AT FORTY TWO NOW AND YOUE NEED TO BE AT THIRTY AND FORTY YEARS  I CANT CUT IT YOU HAVE TO BE A LOT FITTER E NOWITS DO THE SAME EXERCISE AROUND STRENGTH AND STABILITY AND WITHOUT EXCEPTION MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY DO THIS EXERCISE WILL FIND OUT THEY'RE WELL BELOW WHERE THEY NEED TO BE SO THE GRAVITY OF AGING IS MORE VICIOUS THAN PEOPLE REALIZE AND THEREFORE THE HEIGHT OF YOUR GLIDER NEEDS TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN YOU THINK IT IS WHEN YOU'RE OUR AGE IF YOU WANT A PEABLE TO DO THE THINGS WE PROBABLY WHEN BELE TO DO WHEN WE'RE NINETY I ABSOLUTELY LOVE FOR THIS APPROACH I'VE NEVER DONE IT IN TERMS OF MY HEALTH I'VE ALWAYS THUGHT ABOUT WHAT I WANT A COMPLISH IN THE NEXT THREE TO SIX MONTHS OR NEXT YEAR OR SO AND BY THEWAY THAT'S A GREAT APPROACH THAT'S FORECASTING FORECASTING IS FANTASTIC FORECASTING IS REALLY GOOD AT SHORT TERM THINGS IT DOESN'T WORK FOR LONG TERM THINGS LONG TERN YOU HAVE TO DO BACKCASTING THIS BACKCASTIG APROACH REALLY APPEALS TO ME BECAUSE IN MY CAREER I NEVER ANTICIPATE SKESE ME I NEVER INTOSPADE I' BE PODCASTING IM BUT THAT'S WHAT I DID AT SOME POINT AS AN UNDERGRADUATE I LOOK PROFESSORS THAT LOOKS LIKE A PRETY GOOD LIFE THEY SEEM PRETTY HAPPY I TALK TO FEW OF THEM AND THN I FIGURED OUT WHAT I NEED TO DO AT EACH STAGE IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT NEXT WRUNG ON THE LADTER IN JUS CONO TIGURED IT OUT IN IN A BACKCASTING KIND OF WAY AS YOU REFER TO IT A I THING IS INCREDIBLY USEFUL BECAUSE IT PUTS ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT BLOOD WORK AND HOW OFTEN HEY GET BLOOD WORK AND WHAT TO MEASURE IN IN A REALLY NICE CONTACT HAS HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE OR SO IM AND I SHOULD GIVEN NOD TO ANY DUKE I USED TO ALWAYS REFER TO THIS IS REVERSE ENGINEERING BUT IN ANY DUKE'S BOOKS YOU WROTE ABOUT THIS EXACT THING AND CALLED IT BACKCASTING IN I WAS LIKE I LIKE TO TERN BACKCASTING BETTER I THINK IT' MORE INTUITIVE AN REVERSE ENGINEER YET THERE'S A REAL GENIUS TO IT AND I THINK IT CAUSE I SET SO MANY THINGS INTO THE APPROPRIATE BEENS IN TROJECTORIES I'VE HEARD YOU TALK BEFORE ABOUT SOME OF THE PRIME MOVERS FOR LONGEVITY AND ALLRUS MORTTALITY A AND I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO REVIEW A LITTLE BIT OF THAT FOR US AM ITHINK WE ALL KNOW THAT WE SHOULDN'T SMOKE BECAUSE IT'S VERY LIKELY THATLL DI EARLIER IF WE SMOKE NICOTINE I'M NEITHER A MAROANTA NOR A NICOTINE SMOKER SI YOU'LL ON STABLE GROUND THERE ABUT ANT TI WE SEE SMOKING NOWADAYS PEOPLE WANT REALLY WANTED DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CANNABAS AND NICCOTINE I'M SO I AM CURIOUS ABOUT ANY DIFFERENCE IS THERE INTERMS OF I'M IMPACT ON MONGEVITY BUT IN THAT CONTEXT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ANY O N AN EVERY ONE CAN DO SHOULD DO TO TO LIVE LONGER HE CINCLLY HOW LONG YOU GO WELL YOU TELL ME YOU TELL ME I LI'D LIKE TO LIVE TO BE I'D LIKE MY FINAL DECADE TO BE BETWEEN NINETY AND A HUNDRED ONOAAND WILL WE SPEND FROM NOW UNTIL YOU'RE NINETY DI ABU EL THERE'S A RISK OF THAT BUT I'M TOP CONTRARY'S FINE AND YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF CONTE IN THITS AND W WE WILL GIVE PEOPLE LENGTH TO SOME OF THAT MORNING DEPT CONTENT BUT YOU KNOW THE TET SEN WAS NON A SHORT FLIGHT FROM HERE TO SAN DIEGO IWEREN LOSS ARKGUUS NOW A AND WE GOT TAKE OFF IN LANDING AND WE DON'T WANT A CINK OUR NACK TOO MUCH BY DOING THIS THING SO FI JU SAID HEY YOU KNOWT GIVE ME THAT THE EXTENDED VERSION OF THE THREE BY FIVE CARD AWHAT IS THAT LOOK LINE IM SO LET'S START WITH A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HILAR IT'S O SMOKING HOW MUCH TO SMOKING INCREASE YOUR RISK OF ALL CAUSE MORTALITY AND AND THE REASON WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'SCALLED A C MER ALL CAUSE MORTALITY IS IT'S REALLY AGNOSTIC TO HOW YOU DIE AND THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE SENS O M IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW AS A VERY SPECIFIC INTERVENTION LIKE A ANTI CANCER THERAPUTE AT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT CANCER SPECIFIC MORTALITY OR HEARTSPECIFIC MORTALITY BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE SORT OF BROAD THINGS WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A C M SO YOU KNOW USING SMOKING SMOKING IS A PROXIMATELY A FORTY PER CENT INCREASE IN THE RISK OF A C M WHAT DIS THAT TRANSLATE TO YOU AN A THAT MEANS I'M I'M SHORTENING MY LIFE BY FORTY PERCENO IT MEANS AT ANY POINT IN TIME THERE'S A FORTY PER CENT GREAT GREATER RISK THAT YOU'RE GIN A DIE RELATIVE TO A NON SMOKER AND OWEVER SMOKER THATS WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINC DOESN'T MEAN YOUR LIFE SPAN IS GITINOG TO FORTY PER CENT LASS IT MEANS AT ANY POINT IN TIME STANDING THERE YOUR RISK OF DEATH IS FORTY PER CENT HIGRER I'M AND BY THEWY THAT'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU RIGHT AT SOME POINT THAT THAT CATCHES UP I HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 'S ABOUT A TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE IN ALL CAUSE MORTALITY I'M YOU TAKE SOMETHING REALLY EXTREME LIKE ENSTAGE KIDNEY DISEASE SO THESE ARE PATIENTS THAT ARE ON DIALYSIS WAITING FOR AN ORGAN AND GET THERE'S A CONFOUNDER THERE BECAUSE THERE'S WHAT'S THE UNDERLYING CONDITION THAT LEADS YOU TO THAT IT'S YOU A PROFOUND HIGHT PERTENSION YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT TYPE TO DIABEDIES THAT'SBEEN UNCONTROLLED YOU KNOW THAT'S ENORMOUS THAT'S ABUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE IN A C M SO THE HAZARD RACIOS LIK TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE I'M TYPE TOO DIABEDIES IS PROING ABOUT A ONE POINT TO FIVE AS WELL SO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE SO NOW THE QUESTION IS LIKE HOW O YOU IMPROVE SO WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT IMPROVE THO SO NOW HERE WE DO THIS BY COMPARING LOW TO HIGH ACHIEVERS AND OTHER METRICS SO IF YOU LOOK AT LOW MUSCLE MASS PERS IS HIGH MUSCLE MASS WHAT IS THE IMPROVE MEN AND IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANCE ABOUT THREE ACTS SO IF YOU COMPARE LOW MUSCLE MASS PEOPLE TO HIGH MUSCLE MASS PEOPLE AS THE AGE THE LOW MUSCLE MASS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT A THREE X HAZARDRATIA WERE TWO HUNDRED PER CENT INCREASE IN ALL CAUSE MORTALITY NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATE A MORE CAREFULLY YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S PROBABLY LESS THE MUSCLE MASS FULLY DOING THAT IN IT'S MORE THE HIGH ASSOCIATION WITH STRENGTH AND WHEN YOU START TO TEAS OUT STRENGTH YOU CAN REALIZE THAT STRENGTH CAN BE PRAABLY THREE AND A HALF AX AS A HAZARD RATIO MEANING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT GREATER RISK IF YOU HAVE LOW STRENGTH TO HIGH STRENGTH MY STRENGTH IS YO ABILITY TO MOVE LOADS AT AD AND I DO  IN I WON IM IT IT'S ALL TO FIND BY GIVEN STUDIES SO SOME THE MOST COMMON THINGS THAT ARE USED ARE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF EXPERIMENTS THAT MAKE IT EASY TO DO O DONN'T THINK THEY'RE THE BEST MATRICS SO THEY'RE USUALLY USING LIKE GRIP STRENGTH IM LEG EXTENSIONS AND LIKE WALLSITS SQUATS THINGS LIKE THAT SO HOW LONG CAN YOU SIT IN A SQUATTED POSITION AT NINETY DEGREES WITHOUT SUPPORT WOULD BE A GREAT DEMONSTRATION OF QUAD STRENGTH A LEG EXTENSION AM OU KNOW HOW MUCH WEIGHT CAN YOU HOLD FOR HOW LONG RELATIVE TO BODYWAIGHT THINGS LIKE THAT A YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE A WHOLE STRENGTH PROGRAMME THAT WE DO WITH OUR PATIENTS WE HAVE SOMETHIN ALLE THE ESSIMAS IFS TA STRENGTH METRICS OF SESSMENT AND WE PUT THEM THROUGH A LEVEN TESTS THAT I'M ARE REALLY DIFFICULT YOU'D LIKE A DEAD HANG IS ONE OF LIKE HOW LONG CAN YOU DEAD HANG YOUR BODYWIGH UF LIKE THAT SO WE'RE TRUN I BE MORE GRANULAR IN THAT INSIGHT BUT TIE IT BACK TO THESE PRINCIPLES IF YOU LOOK AT CARDYO RESPIRATORY FITNESS IT'S EVEN MORE PERFAUND SO I'M IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE BOTTOM TWENTY FIVE PER CENT FOR THEIR AGE AND SEX AND TERMS OF VIO TO MAX AND YOU COMPARE THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAT RE JUST AT THE FIFTIETH TO SEVENTY FIFTH PER CENTILE IM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A TWO AC DIFFERENCE ROUGHLY IN I'M IN  IN THE RISK OF AS AM IF YOU COMPARE THE BOTTOM TWENTY FIVE PER ENT TO THE TOP TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW BOTTOM QUARTER TO THE ELEAT FOR GIVEN AGE IM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE AXS WE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT DIFFERENCE IN ALL CAUSE MORTALITY THAT'S WHAT BE THE SINGLE STRONGEST ASSOCIATION I 'VE SEEN FOR ANY MODIFIABLE BEHAVIOUR CREDIBLE SO I WHEN YOU SAY LEATESE ARE A PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING MARITHONS AT A PRETTY RAPID CLIP NOT NECESSARILY ITS JUST LIKE WHAT THE VIO TWO MAX IS FOR THAT LIKE MY VIEW TWO MAXS WOULD BE IN THE ELEAT FOR MY AGE GROUP MY VIAW TWO MAXS YOU NOW'T BUT A BEAGAIN IT'S I'M BM TRAINING VERY DELIBERATELY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN THAT SO I WOULDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF TO LEAT AT ANYTHING ANY MORE BUT I STILL MAINTAIN AF YOU TWO MAXS THAT IS A LEAT FOR MY AGE A ACAN TO YOU IN A LE  PHYSICIAN AND AND GUY ALL AROUND BUT TRUE AM BUT IN TERMS OF IT SO FOR THE POINT IS LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A WORLD CLASS ATHLET TO BE A LIKE YOURE YA GOT IT AM SO MAY WE TALK A OFIT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC SURROUND THE TRAINING TO GET INTO THAT A YOU KNOW TOP TO TIERS THERE BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THOSE ARE ENORMOUS POSITIVE EFFACTS OF CARTY O ASCULA EXERCISE A FAR GREATER THAN THE SORTS OF NUMBERS THAT I SEE AROUND THAT'S JUS SAY SUPPLEMENT AR SOLLE TAN A AND THAT YOU KNOW LIKE THIS IS MY WHOLE PETPEEVEAN LIFE FOR I DIDS LIKE I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE MASCINATING AND ARGUING ABOUT THIS SUPPLEMENT VERSIS THAT SUPPLEMENT AND I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THOSE ARGUMENTS UNTIL YOU HAVE YOUR EXERCISE HOUSE IN ORDER AM YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T BE ARGUING ABOUT YOU'R THIS NEW ONCE IF YOUR CARNIVORE DIETVERSES THIS NEW ONE OF YOUR PALEO DIVERSES THIS NEW ONE OF YOUR VIGUE AN DIET LIKE UNTIL YOU CAN DEADLIF YOUR BODY WEIGHT FOR TEN RAPS LIKE THEN THEN YOU CAN COME AND TALK ABOUT THE THINGS ARE SIMPLY LETS TIS RA WITS OM MATRICS I UNTIL YOUR VIEW  TWO MAX IS AT LEAST OF THE SEVENTY FIFTH PER CENTILE AND YOU'RE ABLE TO DEAD HANG FOR AT LEAST A MINUTE ENDER ABLE TO WALL SIT FOR AT LEAST TWO LIKE WE COULD RATTLE OFF A BUNCH OF RELATIVELY LOW HANGING FRUIT I WISH THERE WAS A RULE THAT SETT LIKE YOU COULDN'T TALK ABUT ANYTHING ELSE HEALTH RELATED  E  WE CAN MAKE THAT RU NO ON LISTENING TO IT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT WE CAN MAKE WHATEVER ULS WE WANT WE CAN CALL AT TEAS RULE AT ONE THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE IN THIS POD CASTIN ON SOCIAL MEEDY AS JUST BARRING FROM THE TRADITION IN SCIENCE WHICH IS IT'S IN APPROPRIATE TO NAME SOMETHING AFTER YOURSELF UNLESSYOU WERE A SCIENTISTS BEFORE NINETEEN FIFTY AM BUT IT'S TOLY A PROPRY TO NAME THINGS AFTER OTHER PEOPLE'S OMIN A CALL IT A TEAS RULE UNTIL YOU CAN DO THE FOLLOWING THINGS AM DON'T TALK LLEASE REFRAIN FROM TALKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND NETRITION ERNIS HEREAFTER THOUGHT O'VE REFERRED TO AND REFERENCE AS A TAS RULE I QOIN THE PHRASE NOT HIM SE THERE'S KNOW YE GO INVOLLED BUT OT US NOW A TEA'S RULE WATCH OUT HASHDAG A TE'S RULE OGAT AM WICCAPEDIA ENTERED A TEAS RULE IN ALL SERIOUSNESS AND I AM SERIOUS ABOUT THAT A DEAD HANG FOR ABOUT A MINUTE SEEMS LIKE A A REALLY GOOD GOAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AT LEAST TENS AR THAT'S OUR GOAL I THINK WE HAVE A MINUTE AND A HALF IS THE GOAL FOR A FORTY YEAR OLD WOMAN TWO MINUTES AS THE GOAL FOR FORTY YEAR OLD MAN SO WE ADJUST THEM UP AND DOWN BASED ON A AGE AND GENDER REAT AND THEN A THE WALLSIT WHAT'S WHAT ARES SOME NNOEASO WALLSIT WE DO AS AS JUST A STRAIGHT SQUAT AIR SQUAT AT NINETY DEGREES A AND I BELIEVE TWO MINUTES AS THE STANDARD FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AT FORTY GREAT AND THEN A BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE THINK INTERMS OF YOU TWO MAXES WILL MORE COMPLICATED THEY MIGHT OUT HAVE EXTASSY EQUIPMENT OR TO MEASURED ET CETERA AM WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THING BONTERMS OF PARTY OF ASKLERS A RUN A MILE AT AT SEVEN MINUTES OR LAST EIGHT MINUTE  LA O QUESTION SO THERE ARE VIO TO THERE AR REALLY GOOD VIO TO MAX ESTIMATORS ON LINE AND YOU CAN PLUG IN YOUR ACTIVITY DIZURE SO UL BE AT A BIKE RUN OR ROWING MACHINE AND IT CAN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF OF THAT AND I I DON'T RI USED TO KNOW ALL OF THOSE  BUT NOW THAT I JUST ACTUALLY DO THE TESTING I DON'T RECALL THEM BUT IT'S EXACTLY THAT LINE OF THINKING LIKE CAN YOU RUN A MILE IN THIS TIME IF YOU CAN YOUR VIEW TWO MAX AS A PROXIMALELY THIS GREAT   N I THINK SOMEWHERE IN MY PODCAST ROUND I'VE GOT ALL THOSE CHART CHARTS POSTED OF LIKE THIS IS BY AGE BY SAXS THIS IS WHAT THE VIO TWO MAXES IN EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS TRIV IT WILL PROVIDE LINX TO THOSE WHO'LL HAVE OUR PEOPLE FIND THOSE LINKS AND THEN AM YOU MENTION DEAD LEFTING BODY WEIGHT TEN TIME I JUST MADE THAT ONE OUT I NOT THAT'S NOT ONE THAT WE INCLUDE BUT BUT SOMETHING SOMETHING LIKE THAT IM WE USED WE USE FARMER CARRIES SO WE'LL SAY FOR A MAIL YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FARMER CARRY YOUR BODY WEIGHT FOR I THINK WE HAVE TWO MINUTES OR SO THAT'S HALF YOUR BODY WEIGHT IN EACH HAND IM YOU' BEBLE TO WALK WITH THAT FOR FOR TWO MINUTES IM FOR WOMEN I THINK WE'RE DOING SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT A BODY WAIYT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU GREAT I LOVE IT AM AS IN DIRECT MEASURES OF HOW HEALTHY AND YAHU YARN HOW LONG WEYA IT'S BASICALLY GRIP STRENGTH IT'S MOBILITY I MEAN AGAIN WALKING WITH THAT MUCH WAIGHT FOR FOR SOME PEOPLE INITIALLY IS REALLY HARD  YOUKNOW WE USE DIFFEREN THINGS LIKE VERTICAL JUMP GROUND CONTACT TIME IF YOURE JUMPING OFF A BOX THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S IT'S REALLY TRYING TO CAPTURE AND IT'S IT'S AN EVOLUTION RIGHT LIKE I THINK THE THE TEST IS GOING TO GET ONLY MORE AND MORE INVOLVED AS WE AS WEEP AS WE GOUT AVOLVED CAUSE IT TOOK US ABOUT A YEAR BETH LEUIS DID THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK TO DEVELOP THIS I BETH RUNS OUR STRENGTH AND STABUILITY PROGRAMM IN THE PRACTICE AND NEAR BASK I JUST HASTOR WITH LIEHE GOT THE LITERATURE AND COME UP WITH ALL OF THE BEST MOVEMENTS THAT WE THINK OUR PROXIES FOR WHAT YOU NEED TO BE LIKE THE MOST KICK ASK YOU NOWE WHAT WE CALL CENTINERY INTO CATHOLEY WHICH IS THE PERSON LIVING IN THEI MARGINAL DECADE OF THE BEST WELL WHAT I'M ABOUT SAY IS CERTAINLY AT A MECHANISTIC LEAP BUT IF LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON EXERCISE OR LAD NER OF GENISIS IN MYE AM OR BRAINATROPHY OR BRAIN A HYPERTROPHY ET CETERA AM INANIMAL MODELS IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE BEST WAY TO GET A NERVOUS SYSTEM TO ATROPHY TO LOSE NERON SHRINK NURANS AND OR LOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EURANS IS TO STOP THAT ANIMAL FROM MOVING OR TO D AN RICHES ENVIRONMENT DEDEPRIVATE OF SOME SCENSORY AND PUT OR MULTIBLE CENSORY AND PUT'S IN THE BEST WAY TO ENHANCE AM THE SIZE OF NERANS THE UMBER OF CONNECTIONS BETEE ORANS AND MADE EVEN THE NUMBER OF NERANS IS TO EN RICHES ENVIRONMENT AND GETTING MOVING WHILE EN RICHING THAT ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW ANDER I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SAY THE SAME AS NOT TRUE IN HUMANS AND ND SO THE FIRST TIME THIS BECAME CLEAR TO ME WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I I HAD AN ANALIST DAND PALICHAR AND I SAID DAN MIN TO GIVE YOU A PROJECT IT IS VEXING ME TO KNOW AND WHICH IS IM I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE LITERATURE THAT WE HAVE BOTH MECHANISTIC AND CLINICAL TRIAL DATA THAT TALKS ABOUT ALL SIMER'S PREVENTION AND I WANT TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE TYPE OF IN PUT ND I WANT TO HAVE A A CLEAR SENSE OF VE O WHAT MECHANISM DOES IT OFFER WHAT MODE OF PROTECTION AND IT TOOK DAN N THIS WAS I BESEY WE WE ITERATED A LOT ON THIS TOGETHER IM AND HE CAME BACK WITH CAN OF EN AMAZING PRESENTATION THAT TOOK AM INO NINE MONTHS TO A YEAR OF WORK AND WHAT AMAZED ME WAS WHEN HE CAME BACK TO IT HE SAID THESE SINGLE GREATEST EFFICACY WE CAN POINT TO HIS EXERCISE AND AW'S LIKE DANIT'S I TO BE NONSENSE DO THERE'S NO WAY EXERCISE IS THE SINGLE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR THE BRAIN THERE HAS TO BE SOME DRUG YOU'VE MISSE THERE HAS TO BE SOME OTHER THING THAT YOU'VE MISSED AND HE'S LIKE NOW LIKE TH IS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST THING CAUSE YOU'RE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST WHAT ITS DOING TO B D AND ACT THAT'S NOT JUST WHAT IT'S DOING TO VASCULAR AN DITHEALIUM IT'S NOT JUST WHAT I'S DOING TO GLUCOS DISPOSALEN IN SLEN SIGNLING ALLY SINGS LIKE IT'S JUST TOUCHING EVERY ASPECT OF THE BRAIN AND I'S VERY SCEPTICAL FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS CAN OVE REALLY PUSHED ON HIM AND I WAS LIKE ITHINK YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING DOWN I THINK YOUR MISSING SOMETHING AND THEN FINALLY IN THE END LOOPED IN RICHARD ISAACS AND WHO'S AN NEUROLOGIS THAT WE WORK WITH REALLY CLOSELY ON ALL SIMER'S PREVENTION AND YOU KOW ULTIMATELY TURNED INTO A PAPER THAT WE WROTE BASICLY O YOU KOW ABOUT THIS ABUT THIS THIS TOPIC AND N A FEW OTHERS AUSE AGAIN I THOUGHT ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT E P  AND D  CH  LIKE THAT'S GOT TO HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT AND AM IGAIN THERE LOT OF THINGS THAT I THINK DO MATTER AND THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT WE DO FOR ALL SIMER'S PREVENTION BUT I THINK YOU'RE ESAY RIGHT THERE'S NOT ONE THING THAT I'LL TELL PATIENTS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EXERCISING AND BY THE WAY IT'S NOT THE SORT OF PATHETIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE MADE LIK IT'S YOU HAVE TO EXERCISE A LOT MORE IF YOU WANT TO GET THIS MAXIMAN BENEFIT YOU WILL YOU WILL GET YOU KNOW THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT COMES GOING FROM NOTHING TO SOMETHING SO IF YOU GO FROM BEING COMPLETELY SEDENTARY TO DOING FIFTEEN MET HOURS PER WEEK YOU'LL GET PROBABLY OF FIFTY PER CENT REDUCTION AND RISK SO A MET HOUR A MET JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW IS A METABOLIC EQUIVALENT SO'S WERE WERE EXERTIG ABOUT ONE POINT THREE METS SITTING HERE TALKING IF WE WERE SITTING HERE BEING QUIETOR BE ABOUT ONE MAT I'M YOU KNOW WALKING REALLY BRISKLY WOULD BE ABOUT FIVE METS SO FIFTEEN MET HOURS PER WEEK WOULD BE THREE ONE HOUR REALLY BRISK WALK THAT'S NOT A LOT OF WORK BUT JUST GOING FROM DOING NOTHING TO DOING THAT WOULD GIVE YOU FIFTY PER CENT OF THE BENEFIT THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM GOING ALL THE WAY NOW I AGAIN I THINK I'M PERSONALLY A LITTLE SCEPTICAL OF HOW MUCH THAT'S I THINK IT'S PROBY A BIT LESS THAN THAT I THINK THERE'S MORE UPSIDE THAN PEOPLE APPRECIATE BUT THE STUDIES I DON'T THINK AN CAN TRULY CAPTURE THAT BUT LOOK YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S NO REASON TO NOT BE EXERCISING MORE THAN THAT AND AND CAPTURE MORE BENEFIT EVEN THOUGH THE RATE AT WHICH YOU R CRUE IT IS LAST AND IT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE HEALTHSPANSIDE OF THIS WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY CAPTURED IN THOSE DATA THE HEALTHSMAN GET'S BACK TO THE FUNCTIONAL PIECE WE OPENED WITH WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING IN YOUR MARGINAL DECADE YOU WON' ABLE TO PICK UP A GREAT GRAND KID IF THEY COME RUNNING AT YOU YOU ARE ABLE TO GET UP OFF THE FLOOR DOUN BE WL PLAY ON THE FLOOR WITH A KID AND THEN GET UP ON YOUR OWN AND I'VE NOT NOTHEOPLE R THINKING FINAL A YEARS OF LIFE THERE CISING YOU HOW CAN THEY A TAKE THEMSELVES TO THE BATH ROOM THERE THING HOWIN TEY SIT UP OFF THE TOILET THENYOU MEAN GA REALLY BAS VEGETATIVE TIPE FUNCTIONS RIGHT AM AT' SOME LEVEL I LOVE THIS AGAIN THIS IDEA OF MARGINAL DECADE IN USING THAT AS A WAY TOYOU BACKCAST TOU I A TO ACTUAL METHODS AND BEHAVIORS AND OM PRATOR CALLS AT ONCE YOU BE DOING ON A DAILY BASIS A I'LL USE ANICAN DATA AS IT'S NOW CALLED AM TOCITE JUST I KNOW THREE NOABOU PRIZE WINNERS WHICH DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT THEY DID BEAUTIFUL WORK BUT THE POINT IS THAT THEY'RE ALL IN THEIR NINETIES SO I I I'LL NAME THEM CASM AND COMPLIMENTING THEM FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE NOT JUST THEIR WORK BUT WHEN I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBES THE ARICKIN DELL AT COLUMBIA NOBLE PRIZE WONT FOR WORK O MEMORY TORENTSIM VEAS OLF WORK ON NAROW PLASTICITY AND THEN A RICHARD AXEL WHO'S ALSO AT COLUMBIA NO AE PRIZE WHEN HE WORK FOR MOLECOBOLOGY OF SMELLIN AND I'M LECABIOLOGY GENERALLY ALL THREE OF THEM STILL ALIVE RICHARD'S YOUNGER COMPARED TO THE OTHER TOO ALL THREE OF THEM EITHER SWIM JOG OR PLAY TENNIS WERE RACKETBALL I THINK IS RICHARD'S THING MULTIBAL TIMES PER WEK ARIC WAS THEY'RE ALL COGNIVELY STILL EXTREMELY SHARP STILL INTERESTED IN THE ARTS DOING SCIENCE CURIOUS ABOUT SCIENCE RUNNING LABORATORIES WRITING BOOKS GOING ON POTCUS AND IT'S IS INCREDIBLE AGAIN THAT'S ANECDATA BUT I WAS AD A SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT COLLEGUES THAT WERE SO INTELLECTUALLY STRONG WERE ALSO SO OBSESSED WITH EXERCISE AM THAT THEY REALLY ARE OBSESSED WITH THEIR EXERCISE ROUTINE AND ER EARLY ON LINKED THAT TO THEY'RE IM SOME OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL VIGOR OVER TIME I WONT WANTED JUST ALSOES AS A JUMPING OUT WHEN TO ASK ABOUT ONE KIND OF NICHE THING BUT IT COMES UP I'M I'DON'T LY AM AN OUT WHICH ONE OF THOSE TOLD ME THIS BUT ONE OF THOSE THREE INDIVIDUALS I'M CHOOSE AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF NICORAT USED TO BE A SMOKER AND I ASKED HIM WHY AND HE SAID BECAUSE IN HIS ESTIMATION IT'S PROTECTIVE AGAINST PARKINSONS AND ALSHIMERS OR AT LEAST THE NICCOTENNEC A SEAT OF COLLING AUGMENTATION OF NICCOTINE CAS NICTINES AS SHE CLING RECEPTOR OBVIOUSLY I'M IS KNOWN TO CREATE A STATE OF FOCUS AND AND NURL ENHANCEMENT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT NOT SMOKING LET'S TO SAY EN  YOU REALLY CLEAR PEOPLE DON'T SMOKE NICKOTINE VAPE NICCOTINE IS CON SHORTEN YOUR LIVE JUST TERRIBLE IDEA ADDICTIVE ET CETERA IN MY OPINION BUT WHAT AR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT AUGMENTING A SEETAL COLLING THROUGH THE USE OF NICOTINE IN ORDER TO KEEP THE BRAIN HEALTHY AND FOCUS AGAIN THIS IS ONE NOBLE PRIZE WINNER DOESN'T TRULY END OF ONE BUT HE'S SO CONVINCED THAT THIS MATCHIS UP WITH THE MECHANISTIC DATA ON A SEAT OF COLLING AND COGNITION THAT I LOVETY T YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT FI CAN'T SPEAK TO THE A D PREVENTION COMPONENT OF IT I'D HAVE TO RUN THAT BY COMPLO MY COLLEAGUES WHO I COLABORATE WITH HIM THAT BUT I CAN DEFINITLY SPEAK TO THE COGNITIVE AND HANCSMAN PIECE OF IT AND ECTUHE DID IN AMA ON THIS I PROBY A YEAR AGO WHERE I WENT INTO ALL OF THE GORY DETAILS OF IT AND TALKED ABOUT MY OWN USE OF OF NICCOTINE WHICH I'LL CYCHLE ON AND OFF I'VE BEEN DOING FOR LAST TEN YEARS IAVEN'T WHAT FORME D YOU TAKE IT IN AHI USED TO USE THE GUM I DON'T LIKE THE GUM ANY MORE SO NOW I LIKE THESE LITTLE LAWS ANGES IM THAT NO I A FUNNY STORY ABOUT THE SO OUR MUTUAL ACQUAINTANCE DAVID SIN CLAIRE MENTION THE COMPY COMPANY TO ME A YEAR AGO HE'S I A HAV YOU HEARD THIS COMPANY AND I FORGET THE NAME OF THE COMPANY BUT HE GAVE ME SOME NAME SO I GO ON LINE AND IT'S LIKE THIS COMPANY SELLING NICCOTINE I M LIKE I WONDER WHY HE'S ASKED ME TO DO THIS WELL I'L ALL DISH ORDER A BUNCH AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE IT WHY CAUSE WE WERE YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOME REASON WE WERE DOING THIS POTENTIALY THROUGH INVESTMENT SO I GET UP LIKE LITTEALLY ORDERD LIKE A LIFETIME SUPPLY OF THIS STUFF AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD IS ACTUALLY IT'S A RALLY NICE LITTLE PATCH CAUSE I THE THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE GUM WAS I HATED JUST THE THE THE TASTE OF IT 'M SO THEN THE NEXT WE OM TALKING A DAY BAN I LIKE BY THE WAY I ORDERED ALL THAT NICOTINE STUFF YOU TOLD ME ABOUT HEUSE LIKE WHAT AN HE GOS OH THE COMPANY'S NAME WAS SOMETHING ELSE LI I'M SO I'M THE SHORT ANSWER IS I THINK THE STUFF IS ABSOLUTELY A CONCENTRATION A ENHANCING SUBSTANCE 'M IT IS ADDICTIVE AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE WEARY OF THAT NOT'SNOT ADDICTIVE EVERYBODY I PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE NO AM ADDICTION TO IT WHAT SOEVER SO I CAN I COULD DO IT EVERY DAY FOR THIRTY DAYS AND STOP AND EXPERIENCE KNOW WITHDRAWAL I COULD FORGET ABOUT AND IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO MATTER I'M YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE DOSE TRUTHFULLY I MEAN REMEMBER ONE CIGARETTE AS ABOUT ONE MELIGRAM OF NICOTIN AND A LOT OF THESE LAWS INGES WE'LL PLOU FOUR TO AIHTE MELIGRAMS INTOYOU IN ONE SHOT AND FOR SOMEONE WHO IS YOU KNOW NAIVE TO THAT LIKE I AM FOUR MELIGRAMS IS A LOT OF NICOTINE IN ONE BOWLESS SO JUST HAVE TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF IT I'M I GOT A LOT OF FLACK WHEN I DID THIS A IMA FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BUT  PEOPLE WERE LIKE HOW CAN YOU AS A DOCTOR ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE NICOTINE AND I WAS LIKE FIRST WHILE NOT ENCOURAGING ANYBODY TO USE IT I JUST ONE O BEABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE BIO CHEMISTRY OF IT I'M AND IF DISCLOSING THAT I USE IT FROM TIME TO TIME IS IS AN ENDORSEMENT THAN I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I'M BUT ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO MAKE YOUR BRAIN A LITTLE MORE FOCASED I WOULD CONSIDER THAS INFINITELY SAFER THAN WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING WHICH IS USING STIMULANTS  MEAN TO ME I I YOU DON'T I JUST TELL PATIENTS OUTRIGHT LIKE WE ARE UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE PRESCRIBING STIMULANTS I IRESTIN I WERD JUST WERE NOT GIVING ANYBODY AT ER ALL NOT GIVING ANYBODY FIVE ANTS OR ANY OF THESE THINGS I'M NOT TO SAY THEY DON'T HAVE AN APPROPRIATE CLENICAL USE BUT THEY SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED UNDER THE CARE OF SOMEBODY WHOS REALLY MONITERING THE USE CASE FOR IT AND NAUSING THAT AS A TOOL TO ENHANCE YOU KNOW CONCENTRATION IN COGATO PERFORMS IS NOT SOMETHING WERE COMFORTABLE DOING YET IT'S RAMPANT ON COLLEGE CAMPAS AN US I CAN ONLY I'M ARMADAPINA MADAPINA WHICH ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFINITE COURSE BUT I S A NON CLENICALL US NOT PRESCRIBED FOR EIGHTY EIGHTE BUT JUST IT'S RAMPINT RECREATIONAL USE STUDY MASED USE IDAD I'VE SEEN ON MADAPANI SUGGEST THAT IT ONLY REALLY PROVIDES IN NOTROPIC BENEFIT IN SOME ONE WHO IS DEPRIVED I SLEEP IS THERE DATA THAT IN A TOTALLY WELL RESTED PERSON THERE IS A NOTROPIC BENEFIT OF MADAPINA I DON'T KNOW I HAVE ONE EXPERIENCE WITH ARMADAPINA WHERE I TOOK A HALF A RECOMMENDED DOSTIS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR I'M WENT TO GIVE A TALK THIS IS INA WHY AND A FOUR HOURS INTO THE TALK AT MY ACOST SPEAKER CAME UP TO ME AND JUST SAID WHILE FIRST WHILE YOU YELLOW TIT OF A SPIT IN THE CORNING YOUR MOUTH AND SAID WHILEYOU HAVENIN LINKED IN THREE MINUTES AND THIRD A YERE'S ONLY TWO PEOPLE LEUFT IN THE AUDIENCE I WAS SO LAZERED IN THAT I GA FORGOT THE CONTACT AOMALOO IT OF A AND OF A TONNAL VISION O C D TYPE ANYWAY BUT ONE THAT WAS ALL AT TUCK I NEVER I NEVER TOOK ANY MORE OF IT IT WAS A POWERFUL STIMULANT I TAKE A THREE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS OF ALPHAG PC NOW AND AGAIN BEFORE SOME COGNA OF WORK SOMETIMES BEFORE WORK OUT AND I DO SUBJECTIVELY FEEL THAT NARROWS MY FOCUS IN IT IN A NICE WAY A BUT I DON'T TAKE IT MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE A DAY AND MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK IS AN EXAMPLE OF WERE YOU KNOWT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXERCISE VERSES CERT A NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTS FOR LONGGEVITY I THINK THERE MAY BE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS THAT ARE CIND OF INTERESTING AROUND FOCUS BUT NOTHING WOULD COMPARE T A CHANGING OUR ENVIRONMENT LIKE I THINK THAT IF I COMPARE MY FOCUS TO DAY TO MY FOCUS WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE THERE'S NO COMPARISON LIKE IN COLLEGE I WAS TRULY A ROBOT BUT I THINK A LARGE PART OF IT WAS THERE'S NO DISTRACTION THERE'S NO EMALE THERE'S NO SOCIAL MEDIA THERE'S NO INNER NET I MEAN I WAS IN COLLEGE WHEN MOSAIC LAUNCHED IN THE EARLY NINETIES LIKE I IN N YHAD TO WALK LIKE A MILE TO GET TO THE COMPUTER LAB ON A BIG SUNG WORK STATION TO DO ANYTHING IN YOU KNOW SOME COMPUTER COT LANGUAGE SO YOU MEAN YOU'RE SITTING IN YOUR ROOM STUDYING THERE WAS NO DISTRACTION AND I THINK THAT'S A FAR GREATER COMPONENT OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FOCUS THAN THE CHALLEGE WE HAVE TO DAY SO YOU KNOW MY THOUGHTS ON THIS WOULD BE IF WE REALLY WANTED TO RETURN TO A STATE OF FOCUS WERE IN A HALF TO INDIVIDUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOU ARE ENVIRONMENT NDANDI DON'T MATTER NOR WHAT THE ANSWER IS LIKE I'VE TRIED EVERY LITTLE TRICK I CAN THINK OF LIKE CLOSING MY BROWSERS WHEN I'M WRITING AN STAFF BUT OU KNOW JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH WELL LIKE ALL PICK UP MY PHONE EVERY TWENTY MINUTES TO LOOK AND SEE IF I MISS THE TEXS MESSAGE OR SOMETHING STUPID THAT'S PRETTY INFREQUENT I DID A EPISODE ON HABITS AND LOOKING AT THE DATA A IT SEEMS THAT A PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTERRUPTED OR INTERRUPTING THEMSELVE ABOUT ONCE EVERY THREE MINUTES IN THE TYPICAL WORK PLACE NOW THAT TYPICAL AS CHANGED WITH LOTMORE PEOPLE WORKING AT HOME I DO PUT MY PHONE AWAY WHEN I TRYIN WORK THAT NOTHING FOCUSES ME LIKE A DEAD LINE YOU BIT OF A FEAR BASED URGENCY AS THAT THAT'S IT GRAND DEAD LINES YET DROP DEADLINES AS I CALL THEM OR PODCAS WORK IN A RECORD TO DAY THAT NOTHING WORKS QUITE LIKE IT BUT SUCH AS LIE A WHAT THANKS FOR THAT A OFFSHE ABOUT NICOTINE A AGAIN YOU'RE NOT RECOMMENDING IT I'M NOT RECOMMENDING IT BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE THAT AUGMENTING THE ASEEDAL CALLING SYSTEM WHICH IS WHAT NICOTINE DOES IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS AND SOME RELATED TYPE FORM A COLLOGY DOZEN HANDS FOCUS AND PRETTY POTENTLY SO I THINK ITS TOME AN INTERESTING AREA FOR REAL CLENICAL TRALES ONTHING OF THAT SORT LOVE A CHAT ABOU UT HORMONE THERAPIECE AND HORMONS GENERALLY A WHEN ROBERT SUPPOSKY CAME ON THE POD CAST WE TALK TO LITTLEBIT ABOUT MENAPAUS IN THE DATE AROUND MENAPAUSES VERY INTERESTED IN UM THESE FINDINGS THAT I THING GOMING TO GET THIS RIGHT THAT WHETHER OR NOT WOMEN BENEFIT FROM ESTROGEN THERAPY TO OFFSET MENAPAS REALLY DEPENDS ON WHEN THAT THERAPY IS INITIATED I'M NOT YOUR AWARE OF THOSE DATA BUT UT HE CLAIMED THAT IF THEY BEGIN ESTROGEN THERAPY IN THE MIDDLE TO TALE END OF MENAPAS THE OUTCOMES CAN BE IM QUITE BAD WHEREAS IF THEY INITIATE THOSE ESTROGEN THERAPIES AS THEY ENTER MENAPAS OR EVEN BEFORE MENAPAUS HAN THE OUTCOMES CAN BE QUITE GOOD I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE PATIENTS YOU TREAT OUR MALE VIRSES FEMALE AND WHAT AGES THOSE PATIENTS ARE OF COURSE BUT I'M WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT ESTROGEN THERAPY FOR WOMEN MENAPAUS AND I'M HORMONTHERAPIES GENERALLY FOR WOMEN MAYBEVEN TOSTOSTRON THERABY YO HERE ABOUT THAT HESE DAYS AND TEN DE'LL TALK ABOUT MEN SO OUR PRACTICE IS PROBLY SEVENTY THIRTY MALE FEMALE SO WE HAVE LOTS OF WOMEN AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC IM IT'S ALSO ROBABLIE ME THINK A ORN TO MAKE SURE OM NOT BEING HYPROBOLIC WHEN I SAY THIS YI DON'T THINK I AM IT'S HANDS DOWN THE BIGGEST SCREW UP OF THE ENTIRE MEDICAL FIELD IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS O AGAIN IT'S POSSIBLE THE NEXT HOUR I'LL THINK OF NO THERE'S A BIGGER SCREW UP BUT ANOTHER ANOTHER GIANTS YET BUT BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO THINK OF A BIGGER ACT OF IN COMPETENCE THEN WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE WOMEN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE IN THE LATE NINETIES IN EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY THE STUDY THAT TURNED THE ENTIRE MEDICAL FIELD OFF HORMONOR PLACEMEN THERAPY FOR WOMEN SO IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE STUDY LOOKED AT SO THIS WAS A  STUDY IT WAS CONDUCTED IN RESPONSE TO THE WIDELY HEL BELIE IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIDIES THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE PLACED ON HORMONES AS THERE A GOIN THROUGH MENAPAS RIGHT MENAPAUS IS I GUESS MAY BE I'LL EVEN TAKE A STEP BACK I DON'T KNO HOMATEUR AUDIENCE IS FRMILIAR WITH HOW ESTROGEN PROGESTEROWN WORK IS IT WORTH GOING INTO THAT  HIRLY WORTH MENTIONING A BIT OF THE TOP CONTOUR SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH IT WE DONE APISOS ON ESTROGEN TOSTOCTRO BUT FRANKLY S I THINK BACK TO THOSE WE AN'T REALLY GO INTO THE BIOLOGY OF ESTROGEN TOSTOSTRONE ENOUGH YES SO I MEAN ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING ASIDE THAT I ALWAYS TELL MY FEMALE PATIENTS TO GET A KICK OUT OF THIS IM WHEN YOU LOOK AT A WOMEN'S LABS YOU'LL SEE HER ESTROGEN HER PROGESTOR ON HER EFES AGE HER LL AGE HER TESTOSTRON POR SEXMORE BINING GLOB AN ALL THESE THINGS BUT BASED ON THE UNITS THEIR REPORTED IN IT'S A VERY DISTORTING PICTURE OF WHAT THE MOST COMMON ANDRIGEN IS IN HER BODY IF YOU ACTUALLY CONVERT THEM TO THE SAME UNITS SHE HAS MUCH MORE TESTOSTRON AN HER BODY THAN ESTROGEN INTERESTING YE I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEN AGAIN I'VE NEVER BEEN A WOMAN GETTING MY HORMON PROPHALGA YES SO EVEN THOUGH A WOMAN'S TESTOSTERONE IS MUCH LESS THAN A MEN A THAN THAN A MAN'S LEVEL A IT'S STILL MORE THAN SHE HAS ESTROGEN IN HER BODY  SO PHENATYPICALLY RIGHT ESTROGEN IS THE HORMONE THAT'S DOMINATING AND TES SO IT'S THE IN SHE HAS MUCH HIGHER ESTROGEN THAN A MAN AND MUCH LOWER TESTOSTERONE THAN A MAN BUT IN ABSOLUTE AMOUNTS SHE HAS MORE TESTOSTERO THAN ESTROGEN JUST WORTH POINTING ATO  SO A SO SO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO A WOMAN FROM THE GE SHE STARTS MENSTRADING TILL SHE GOES THROUGH MANIPAS OUTSIDE OF PREGNANCE AND BIRTH CONTROL AN STUFF LIKE THAT IS SHE HAS THIS CYCLE IN A ROUGHLY EVERY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS BUT IT CAN VARY WHERE AT THE BEGINNING OF HER PERIOD WE CALL THAT DAY ZERO HER BASIC HER ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE ARE VERY LOW YOU CAN'T MEASURE THEM AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ESTROGEN LEVEL STARTS TO RISE AND IT RISES IN RESPONSE TO A HORMONE CALLED PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMOLONE PHOLICALSTON LATING HORMON EFASATE THAT IS GETTING HER READY TO OVULATE AND SHE OBULATES IT ABOUT THE MID POINT OF HER CYCLE SO FOR JUS CAN O MAKE THE MATH EASY ON DAY FOURTEEN SHE'S GOING TO RELEASE APHOLICAL FROM ONE OF HER OVERIES AND THE ESTROGEN LEVEL IS OR RISING RISING RISING WE LOVE TO MEASURE HORMONES ON DAFIVE BECAUSE I WON'T T HAVE A STANDARDIZE WAY IN WHICH I MEASURE HER HORMONES SO OUR WOMEN KNOW IF WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HER HORMONES THE DAY HER PERIOD STARTS EVEN IF IT'S JUST A DAY OF SPOTTING THAT BECOMES OUR BENCH MARK AND THEN DAFIVE I WANT TO SEE EVERY HORMON ON THAT DAY AND IF EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL I KNOW WHAT HER EFFIS H L H ESTRODYLE AND PROGESTEURONE SHOEULD BE ON THAT DAY SO THE ESTROGEN RISES STARTS TO COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT AS SHE OVULATES AND THEN THE LUTINIZING HORMONE KICKS ON BECAUSE IT'S NOW GOING TO PREPARE HER A UTEROUS FOR THE LINING TO ACCOMMODATE A PREGNANCY SO NOW YOU START TO SEE ESTRODYLE GO BACK BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME PROGESTERON GOES UP SO POGESTERONE HAS BEEN DOING NOTHING FOR FOURTEEN DAYS AND NOW IT STARTS TO RISE AND ACTUALLY PROGESTERONE IS THE HORMONE THAT'S DOMINATING THE CECOND HALF WHICH CALLED HER PIPHILIC A HERLUDIAL CYCLE SO THE FIRST FOURTEEN DAYS OF THE FLICULAR CYCLE SECOND AS THE LUDI LUDAL CYCLE SO ONCE YOU GET TO ABOUT THE HALF WAY POINT OF THAT WHICH IS NOW JUST TO DO THE MATH TWENTY ONE DAYS IN THE BODY HAS FIGURED OUT IF SHE'S PRAGNANT OR NOT AND AGAIN MOST OF THE TIME SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE PREGNANT SO THE BODY SAYS OH I DON'T NEED THIS LINING THAT I'VE BEEN PREPARING I'M GOING TO SHED IT SO NOW PROGESTERONE AND ESTROGEN START CRASHING AND THE LINING IS WHAT IS BEING SHED AND THAT IS THE MENCIES BY THE WAY IT'S THAT LAST SEVEN DAYS OF THAT CYCLE THAT IN A SUSCEPTIBLE WOMAN IS WHAT CREATES THOSE PME SYMPTOMS SO IT'S THE SHE THS IS SOMETHING YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAN ME THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IN A SUSCEPTIBLE WOMAN WHERE THE ENORMOUS REDUCTION OF PROGESTERONE SO QUICKLY IS PROBABLY IMPACTING SOMETHING IN HER BRAIN SO THIS IS THIS IS A LEGITIMATE THING RIGHT IMOIN IT'S NOT LIKE OH SHE'S CRAZY BECAUSE SHE'S HAVING ALWHAYS PME SYMPTOMS KNOW WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT WOMEN ON PROGESTERON FOR THOSE SEVEN DAYS THOSE SYMPTOMS GO AWAY SO F YOU CAN STABLIZE THEIR PROGESTERON DURING THE LAST HALF OF THERE LUDIAL PHASE AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD JUST DO IT FOR THE ENTIRE LUDIAL PHASE JUST PUT THEM ON A LOW DOSE OF PROGESTERON ALL PIAMA SYMPTOMS VANISH VERY INTERESTING I'LL HAVE TO LOOK UP WHERE THE PROGESTER ON RECEPTORS ARE LOCATE IN THE BRAIN THE ALLON A RAININSTITUTE NOW AS BEAUTIFUL DATAA INTEATOU HABRIZATION WHICH R S THE DONARSES A LOOKI AT AR ANA ANDS AE WEREGENES AND A PROCHINS OUGHT TO BE EXPRESSED IN THE HUMAN BRAIN BY USING ASHAL HUMAN BRAINGTICUSACTIONS AS PLUSAGAS MYSELF TAKE A LOOK I THINK YT A TEMIN LAIN VIKERS NOT WHAT THAT A PROGESTER OWN EMOTIONALITY LINK MIGHT BE IN WHERE WHERE IT MIGHT EXIST NORAL CIRCUIT WAS SO THEN WHEN THE ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERON REACH THEIR NAITOR AGAIN THAT STARTS THE CYCLE SO THAT JUST THAT CYCLES HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN CATE SO IT BECAME YOU KNOW WELL KNOWN IN THE FIFTIES THAT  WOMAN'S GOINGTO STOP MENSTRATING AT SOME POINT HER ESTROGEN GOES DOWN WHY DO'T WE JUST GIVE HER ESTRGEN CAUSE THAT'S CLEARLY GOING TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF MANAPAS SO WHAT WHAT THE WOMEN EXPERIENCE WHEN THY GO THROUGH MANAPAS THE FIRST SYMPTOMS ARE WHAT ARE ALLED VASA MOTOR SYMPTOMS SO THIS IS USUALLY IN THE FORM OF A NIGHTSWEATS HOT FLASHES SO AND DEPENDING ON THE WOMEN THIS CAN BE REALLY SIGNIFICANT RIGHT THESE ARE WOMEN WHO CAN HAVE A HARD TIME SLEEPING THEY CAN BE HAVING HOT FLASHES DURING THE IDDLE THE DAY THEY CAN WAKE UP SOAKED IN A POOL OF SWEAT A THOSE TEN TO PASS AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THEN THEY GET INTO SORT OF THE MORE LONG TERM COMPLICATIONS OF MANAPAS SO WE CALL VAGENAL ATROPHY VAGENAL DRYNESS AND THEN THE STUFF THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A WHILE AGO WHICH IS THE A OSTIOPENIA OSTIOPEROSIS A A LOT OF WOMEN WILL COMPT COMPLAIN OF BRAIN FOG A SO I MEAN CLEARLY THIS WAS AN ISSUE AND IT WAS RECOGNIZE SEVENTY YEARS AGO WHY DON'T WE GIVE WOMEN ESTROGEN BACK TO REPLACE THAT HORMON AND SO THAT WENT ON FOR HE COUPLE OF DECADES MAY BE LST MAY BE A DECADE AND THEN IT WAS REALIZED WAY T A MINUTE WE WERE DRIVING UP THE RISK OF UTERAN CANCER A AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IF YOU JUST GIVE ESTROGEN WITH NO PROGESTERON TO ANTAGONIZE IT YOU WILL THICKEN THE ENDEMETRIUM ENDLESSLY AND YOU WILL INCREASE THE RISK OF HYPEROPLASIA WELL YOU'LL YOU'LL DEFINALLY UNDERGO HYPEROPLASIA AND THEN ULTIMATELY DISPLASIA DISPLEASIA IS PRECANCEROUS AND ULTIMATELY A WE WERE SEEN THAT SO PEOPLE FIGURED OUT WELL ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT TO GIVE ESTROGEN TO A WOMAN WHO STILL HASTER UTERIS YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER PROGESTERON AS WELL YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A HORMON TO OPPOSE THE ESTROGEN AND THEN THAT BECAME EFFECTIVELY IN THE NINETEEN CALL AT THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES ISH THE STANDARD FOR A FOR EH AR TE SO IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES A THE ANN I H SAID LOCK WE HAVEN'T REALLY STUDY THIS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TON OF EPIDEMIAHOLI G THAT SAYS GIVING WOMEN HORMONES SEEMS TO BE DOING REALLY GOOD THINGS THEY FEEL BETTER SO THEYRE ALL THEIR SYMPTOMS GO AWAY THEY SEEM TO HAVE LOWER RISK OF HEART DISEASE LOWER RISK OF YOU KNOW A CARTIOVASCULAR PERME LOWERISCOF HERRACITIES LOWER RISK OF A BONE FRACTURES A EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GET THTER LAWRISK OF DIBEDES BUT WE HAVEN'T TESTED THIS IN A RANOMIZED PROSPECTIVE TRIAL SO LET'S DO THIS SO THAT BECAME THE W H I AND IT RANDOMIZED IT HAD TWO PARALLEL ARMS SO IT HAD A GROUP FOR WOMEN WHO DID NOT HAVE HA UTERIS A SO TESE ARE WOMEN THAT HAD UNDERGONE HISTORICK ME FOR SOME OTHER REASON AND THEN IT HAD A GROUP FOR WOMEN THAT DID HAVE THEIR UTERIS IN THE FIRST GROUP THE THERE IS A PLICEBEO ARM AND THEN AN ESTROGEN ONLY ARM AND IN THE OTHER GROUP THERE WAS A PROGESTOR ON PLUS ESTROGEN VERST IS A PLACEBO EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WAY THIS STUDY WAS DONE IS A BIT WONKEY SOME OF IT IS JUSTIFIABLE BUT IT'S IM PORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FIRST THE WOMEN WERE ALL WAY OUTSIDE OF MENAPAUS SO NONE OF THESE WOMEN WERE STARTED WHEN YOU WOULD NORMALLY START H ARTEE AND I'M THERE WERE POBLY US SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT BUT ONE OF THEM IS AND I THINK THIS IS E  LEGITIMATE REASON THEY WANTED HARD OUTCOMES THEY WANTED TO KNOW DEATH RATES AND IF YOU'RE DOING THIS ON WOMEN IN THEIR FIFTIES YOU JUST WORE'K IN TO GET IT RIGHT YOU COULDN'T WAIT YO LOW YET YGET A WAY TOO LONG AND THAT THIS WAS ONLY GIN TO BE LIKE A SEVEN TO TEN YEAR STUDY SO THEY HAD TO DO THIS ON WOMEN WHO WERE MUCH OLDER THEY ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY TOOK MUCH SICKER WOMEN I BELIEVE THE PREVALENCE AND IGAN I GOAN TO GET SOME OF THESE NUMBERS WRONG AND PEOPLE A GNG TO GET ALL PHOSPHORELATED BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN I'M IN THE BALLPARK RIGHT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY FORTY PERESENT OFTHSE WOMEN WERE SMOKERS THE PREVALENCE OF OBSITY DIABEDES WAS ENORMOUS SO THEY THEY THEY THEY REALLY DIS PROPORTIONALELY PICKE THE MOST UNHEALTHY POPULATION THEY COULD THAT WAS PRETTY ADVANCED IN AGE AND AGAIN I THINK PART OF THAT WAS TO SAY LOOK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AFTER SEVEN YEARS WE REALLY KNOW IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THESE CAUSES OF DEATH I'M THE OTHER THING IS IS A CONT A WEARD ALLHOGAGANT IGT I UNDERSTAND THEIR RATION ELL FOR IT BUT THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CLENICAL TRIAL THAT IT REMOTELY REPRESENTS THE PATIENTS YOURE INTERESTED IN TREATING SO THEY ALSO TREATED NO PATIENTS WHO WERE SYMPTOMATIC THE RATIONEL BEING IF WE INCLUDE IN THE STUDY PATIENTS WHO WERE SYMPTOMATIC THOSE WHO WERE RANDOMIZED TO PLICEBO WILL DROP OUT O G IMAKE SENSENTERMS OF STUDY DESIGN MAKES NO SENSE IF THI STID DESIGN IS A INTENDED TO MIMIC THE REAL WORLD THAT'S RIGHT SO NOW LET'S JUST KEEP TRACT OF THE THREE ISSUES WE HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY UN HEALTHY PATIENT POPULATION WHO ARE NOT SYMPTOMATIC AND WE'RE STARTING THEM MORE THAN TEN YEARS AFTER MENOPAS THE NEXT THING THAT THEY DID WHICH AGAIN IUNDERSTAND WHY THEY DID IT BUT IT'S NOW THE FOURTH STRIKE AGAINST THIS STUDY IS AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE P I OF THE STUDY AND ASKED THIS QUESTION POINT BLANK N MI SHEL GON TO HAVE HER ON MY PODCAST AT SOME POINT SOON TO GO OVER THIS AND MORE DETAIL AM IS WHY DID YOU USE CONJUGATED EQUINE ESTROGEN AN M P  WHICH IS A SYNTHETIC FORM OF PROGESTERON HORSE YES ELT HORSE IT'S HORSE URIN IS THE THEY COLLECT HORSE URAN SO THEY'RE GETTING THE IT'S LURSES DO YOU RENAINE A LOT ORE AT LEAST WHEN THEY UR IN A IT SEEMS LIKE A LARGE VOLUME OF YOURN FROM WHAT IVE OBSERVED YOU HAVE LOTICS TERINOW WHAT YOU KNOW MY SISTER RODE HORSES FOR A LIT WHILE MY HESCADOFRAN HAD A HORSE AND THAT THING I MEAN THE THE THE PES WERE LEGENDERY MALE HORSE SO YESTH THE CONJUGATED EQUINE ESTROGEN IS THE ESTROGEN THAT'S COLLECTED FROM FROM FEMALE HORSE IS AND THEN IT'S A SYNTHETIC PROGESTURON AND I SAID TO TO A  THE PROSISIVE WHY DIDN'T YOU USE WHAT WE USE TO DAY WHICH IS BYO IDENTICAL ESTROGEN IN PROGESTEURON LIKE TO DAY WHEN WE PUT WOMEN ON ESTROGEN WE USE AIT'S AN FTA PRODUCT CALLED THE VEVELL DOT SO IT'S A PATCH THAT YOU JUST PUT ON AND IT'S ESTRA DIAL BUT IT'S BYO IDENTICAL ESTRA DIAL AND WE USE WHAT'S CALLED MICRONIZED PROGESTERAN SO BYO IDENTICAL PROGESTERON AND SHE SAID WELL AT THE TIME WE JUST WANTED TO TEST WHAT WAS CURRENTLY BEING USED I SAID TOLY MAKE SENSE BUT AGAIN NOW YOU HAVE FOUR CONSIDERATIONS THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MINE O CASE SO DESPITE THOSE FOUR CONSIDERATIONS NDIM GONG TO MAKE A CASE FOR YOU WHY I THINK THE M P A CRATED A REAL PROBLEM IN THAT STUDY THE SONTHATIC PROGESTERON WHEN THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS WE'RE FIRST MADE AVAILABLE BUT NOT YET PURE REVIEWED AND NOT YET PUBLISHED THERE WAS A HUGE FIASCO HUGE PRES ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT IT SUGGESTING THAT THE WOMEN RECEIVING THE C E E PLUS M P A IN THE AA GROUP WITH THE UTER AS HAD A HIGHER INCIDENTS OF BREAST CANCER AND THAT BASICALLY BECAME THE HEADLINE THAT NEVER WENT AWAY THOUGH IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE TRUE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS WHAT WAS THE INCREASE IN THE RISK OF BREAS CANCER IN THAT GROUP WHICH GETS TO MY ONE OF MY TI YOU EVERELISTEIN G ON A PODCAST RAIL ON SOMETHING AS AN I HAVE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED PET BEAVES AN COUNTING MY LABORATORY STAFF KNOW THES A NO GOOD NUMBER OF THEM SO YOU'RE ALDAN W IAM NOT OT TO APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING MANY THAT PEVES BECAUSE AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A EXPERIENCE INDATED TO SUPPORT THEM IT PROVISA ONE MY LEGIS PET PEAVES IS I MY MY TEM KNOWS THIS CAS SOMETIMES THEY'LL OCCASIONALLY YOU KNOW THEY'LL DO THIS I OFT FORO MINE THEM YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT A RELATIVE RISK CHANGE WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE RISK ACCOMMODATING IT I SO SO WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE SO THE THE RELATIVE RISK INCREASE OF BREAS CANCER IN THE ESTROGEN PLUS M P  GROUP VERSES THE PLACE BO WAS TWENT FIVE TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT AND TH IT BECAME THE ONLY HEADLINE H OR T INCREASES RISK OF BRESCANCER BY TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT NOW I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE AT ALL TO DAY BUT LET'S EVEN LOOK AT THE DATA WHAT WAS THE A R WHAT WAS THE ABSOLUTE RISK INCREASE IT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIVE CASES PER THOUSAND AND FOUR CASES PER THOUSAND SO THE A R R WAS ZERO POINT ONE PER CENT ONE CASE IN A THOUSAND AND IT'S TRUE GOING FROM FOUR IN A THOUSAND TO FIVE AND A THOUSAND IS A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE BUT IT'S A COMPLETELY IN APPROPRIATE CONTEXT I AGREE AND I FEEL LIKE HEADLINES OF THAT SORT WHICH HAVE COME UP RECENTLY AROUND VARIOUS DIETARY INTERVENTIONS WE WON'T THOUGH THERE AT LEAST ORE NOT FOR THE TIME BEING A ARE NOTHING SHORT OF CRIMINAL BECAUSE THEY REALLY THISTORT PEOPLE'S THINKING BUT ALSO THEY STEER THE COURSE OF SCIENCE IN MEDICINE FOR AS YOU POINTED OUT FOR DECATES IF NOT LONGER AND THEY CAN REALLY TAKE US OFF OUR HEALTH TRACK IN ZERIOUS WAYS SO I'LL BRING THIS MEANDERING TO A CLOSE WHICH IS TO SAY EVEN THOUGH I COULD SPEND THE NEXT HOUR TALKING ABOUT ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THE STUDY WAS FLOD AND ALL OF THE VERY UNATHICAL THINGS THAT WERE DONE BY A NUMBER THE INVESTIGATORS WHO WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MASK THE TRUTH OF THIS STUDY FROM THE WORLD I'LL TELL A WOMAN TO DAY WE'REGIN A START YU ON THIS WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH MENOPAS WERE USING BYO IDENTICAL HORMONES AND IF YOUR UPPER BOUND RISK OF BRES CANCER IS OT ONE CASE IN A THOUSAND YOU SHOULD AT LEAST WAY THAT AGAINST ALL THE OTHER BENEFITS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT NOW THER'S SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO SAY BBECAUSE A MOMENT AGO I ILLUDED TO THE FACT THAT I THINK THE M P A MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN THAT STUDY SO THE WHO FINDINGS IN THAT STUDY THAT WERE NEGATIVE ONE WAS THE INSMALL INCREASE IN THE RISK OF HART DISEASE AND A SMALL INCREASE IN THE RISK OF BRESCANCER BUT CONSIDER THE OTHER GROUP WE FORGOT ABOUT THE GROUP THAT DIDN'T HAVE A UTERIS CAUSE REMEMBER THOSE WOMEN GOT ESTROGEN ONLY VERSES PLACIBO WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE IN BREASCANCER THERE WELL THIS IS INTERESTING CAUSE IT DIDN'T REACH THE TISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE BUT IT'S P VALUE WAS POINT O SIX OR POINT O SEVEN SO IT CAME VERY CLOSE BUT IT WAS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IT WAS A TWENTY FOUR PER CENT RISK REDUCTION ABOUT ONE IN A THOUSAND AS WELL SO WHEN YOU HAD ESTROGENPLUS M P A YOU HAD A BARE LEAST TATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT THAT PE VALUE WAS POINTO FIVE SO IT JUST HITSTATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE ONE IN A THOUSAND CASES FOUR BREASTCANCER AND THEN YOU HAD ONE IN A THOUSAND CASES BUT P VALUE OF PONT O SEVEN FOR REDUCTION OF RISK OF BREAS CANCER WHICH TO ME SUGGEST THAT THE M P  THE SYNTHETIC PROGESTERONE WAS PLAYING MORE OF A ROLL THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE SECOND THING I POINT OUT IS ORAL ESTROGEN WHICH WE NO LONGER USE DOES INC REASE COAGULABILITY IT DOESE INCREASE THE ABILITY THE BLOOD TO CLOT A LITTLE BIT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MORE RECENT DATA ON H R T USING TOPICAL ESTROGEN OR PATCHES OF ESTROGEN WE DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL INFECT WE SEE THE OPPOSITE NOW SO NOW WE SEE THE RISK OF HART DISEASE GOING DOWN IN WOMEN WITH ESTRODILE AND SOME WOMEN WILL BE ARRIVING TO THOSE TREATMENTS WEAMUTATIONS AND THINGS LIKE FACT OR FIVE LIGT AND IN OTHER CLOTTING FACTORS IT IS IT A APPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT EVERYONE BOTH MAL IF HE KNOLS SHOULD KNOW WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE MUTEN FORMS OF FACTOR FIVE LIDE AND YOUKNOW WE DON'T TEPICLY TEST PEOPLE FOR FACT OR FIVE A MY WIFE ACT SHE HAS IT BUT WE DIDN'T LEARN IT UNTIL SHE AT HELPSYNDRUM  GIVING BIRTH TO OUR FIRST DAUGHTER AM BUT UM YOU KNOW WE WE KIND OF LOOK FOR MORE FAMILY HISTORY REASON TO BE TESTING THINGS LIKE THAT WE TOAK A PRETTY DETAIL FAMILY HISTORY SO WELL CON LOOK FOR CLOTTING ISSUES THERE ABOUT AM SO YOUR REFLECTS NOW IT IS IS TO WHAT WOMEN ON A THESE TOPICAL AS WELL AS THERE  THE MASICALLY HAVE THE DISCUSSION RASO SO SO HERE'S WERE WE STILL STRUGGLERIGHT IS YOU KNOW WE IF IT WERE UP TO ME I'D PREFER FOR A WOMEN'S A H OR T TO BE PROVIDED BY HER G WY N BECAUSE WE WANT O BEABLE TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE G WY AND WHO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN UNDEMETRAL ULTRASOUN DONE EVERY YEAR AM THAT'S YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT ARGUE THAT'S OVER KILL BUT YOU KNOW WE THINK SHE BE SHOWING A PASSMERE EVERY YEAR AS WELL SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SERVICTS WE WNT TO OOK AT THE ENDO MATRI ME WEN O MAKE TURE THE LINING ISN'T TOO THICK THE OTHER THING I SHOULD SAY UNDER IS TO DAY WE NOW REALIZE THAT NOT ALL WOMEN CAN TOLERATE ESTRA UPPARME PROGESTOROM SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL SO ASSUMING AGAIN A WOMEN STILL HAS HER UTEROUS THE ESTROGEN SOLVES MOST OF THE PROBLEMS BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE CAN SHE TOLERATE THE PROGESTOROM AND IT NEEDS TO BE IF GIVEN SYSTEMICALLY LIKE A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED MELEGRAMS AND FOR SOME WOMEN THAT IS A LIFE SAVING INTERVENTION IN MEAN THEY START SLEEPING BETTER THEIR HAIR GETS THICKER THEY FEEL BETTER BUT FOR SOMEWOMENIT LITERALLY DRIVES TEME CRAZY IT IT'S PROBBY THE RECIPROCAL OF WHAT WE WERE SEEING IN THE CASE OF WOMEN WITH PIAMAS SO IN THOSE SITUATIONS WE SAY GREAT WE'RE DONE WITH ORAL PROGESTERON WE JUST USE A PROGESTERAN COTED I U D SO THEN YOU GET THE LOCAL PROGESTOROM IN THE UTERUS FOR PROTECTION IN THIS YSTEMIC ESTROGEN FASCINATING WHAT ABOUT A OR CONTROCEPTION AM FOR IT IN WOMEN SO THE USE OF ESTROGEN CRONIC LY THROUGH TOS OU KNOW COLLEGE YEARS OR TWENTY THIRTIES MABE VEN TEEN SO KNOWS AM WHAT'S KNOWN ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS TANY I GOT A ON SO THA I DON'T I DON'T THINK I KNOW ENOUGH TO COMMENT ON IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT REALLY IMPACTS MY PATIENT POPULATION AM YOU KNOW AT LEAST IN WHAT I SEE MORE WOMEN ARE USING IUDS FOR A FOR FOR CONTRACEPTION THAN THEN O SS N  WE USE O SS SOMETIMES IN WOMEN WHO ARE PREE MENAPOZZLE FOR SYMPTOMATIC CONTROL BUT WE'LL TYPICALLY USE LIKE A LOLO ESTERANS A VERY LOW I'M SYNTHETIC ASTROGEN WHICH DON'T LIKE USING THESE VERY MUCH BUT IF IT'S ONLYTHING WE CAN GET TO CONTROL CERTAIN SYMPTOMS AND WE'LL USE IT LIKE HALF HER CYCLE UM BUT IT'S TYPICALLY NOT SOMETHING WE'RE WE'RE THAT EXPERIENCED WITH WHAT ABOUT TESTOSTROMIS YOU MENTION THAT YOU KNOW NANAGRAM AM PERMILL A WHEN YOU SAID EVERYTHING TO THE SAME UM YOU KNOW I GESS IS NANIGRAM PRODESELEADER AS IT WOULD BE TO TO KIND OF NORMALIZORS A TAKGRAN PROMAL OU RIGHT YA AND SO YEU THAT'S WHAT A PETERS POINT OUT BEFORE IS THAT YOU LOOK AT YOUR CHARTES IN THEY'RE ALL IN THESE DIFFERENT MEASURES AND SO WHEN YOU NORMALIZED TO STOSTRONIS ASHE THO HIGHER THAN ASTROGEN WHEN THAT'S A SURPRISE TO ME UM DO YOU PRESCRIBE TESTOSTRON THERAPE TO WOMEN EVER WE DO SOMETIMES BUT I DO IT WITH MUCH MORE CAUTION BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE DATA RIGHT SO WHEREIL YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL SAY AS LUCK AND  WE'RE NOW REALLY OUTSIDE OF AN AREA WERE I CAN POINT TO A LOT O DATY LIKE WHEN IT COMES TO ASTROGEN AND PROGESTRON I ILL I'LL HAPPILY GO TOTOTO WITH ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO MAKE THE CASE THAT IT'S DANGEROUS SIMILARLY WHEN IT COMES TO USING TESTOSTRON AN MEN I'L I'LL SPEND ALL DAY AND I CAN GO THROUGH THAT LITERATURE UNTIL THE OTHER PERSON CRIES AND WANTS TO JUST CALL UNCLE RIGHT WHEN IT COME THTHIN FORSCAB THEM TESTOGIO WHEN IT COMES TO ASTROGEN IN  TESTOSTRON AND WOMEN DON'T HAVE THAT DATA AND I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT TRIAL DONE SO HOW WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE SWEET SPOT HOW DO WE HOW WE RECONCILE THAT SO IM IT'S NOT SOMETHING I CONSIDER STANDARD AND BASICALLY IF A WOMEN IS ATFIR TESTOTRON FIRSTMALL IS STAGGERINGLY LOW AND AGAIN EVEN THOUGH HER TESTOSTRON'S LOW COMPARED TO A A MALE WE SHALL HAVE A RANGE SO IF IT'S REALLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT RANGE SHE'S REALLY HAVING DIFFICULTY PUTTING ON MOSCLE MASS AND REALLY COMPLAINING OF LOW LABITO I THINK IN THAT SITUATION WE'LL GO AHEAD USE TOPICAL TESTOSTRON U AND AND YOU KNOW REPLACE HER TO A LEVEL THAT IS STILL PHYSIOLOGICALLY NORMAL NOW THAT'S KEY BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE HERE H OR T THEY THINK ABOUT SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL SEEMS TO BE THE TERM YOUT LIKE I DON'T NOW NEVER SEEN A SINGLE SYMPTOM IN A SINGLE WOMAN THAT I'VE PUT TESTOSTRONON IN TERMS OF LIKE ACNEBODY HERE THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE THOSE ARE REAL SYMPTOMS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF BUT YOU KNON'T LIKE CLITERAL AND LARGE MEN AND THINGS IAT THAT LIKE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN UNDER PHYSIOLOGIC NORMAL CONDITIONS LOVE TO TALK ALOBIT ABOUT ON MON REPLACEMENT THERE BE IN MEN UM WHEN ONE LOOKS ON SOCIAL MEEDING IN THE INNER ND AT THERE SEEMS TO BE A YOUNGER AND YOUNGER COHORITOF GUISE PEOPLE N THEI'RE TEENS AND TWENTY IS SHOWING UP TO THE TABLE THINKING AH THAT INJECTING TESTOSTRON CIPIAN AIHT OR TAKING AN OF OR WHATEVER IT IS IS GOING TO BE THE RIGHT IDEA THEY'RE MAINLY SEEM TO BE FOCUS ON COSMATIC EFFECTS I'M NOT A PHYSICIAN SO I CAN'T SAY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE ACTUALLY HAVE A GANATL ET CETERA BUT IT SEEMS TO ME YAUN CRECT ME IF ON ROBUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SIMILAR TO THE ATIAS RULE AS IT RELATES TO LONGEVITY THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH A ABROAD CONTOA RULE IN WHICH IF THE MALE OF ANY AGE IS NOT TRYING TO GET DECENT SLEEP EXERCISE APPROPRIATELY PROBIT NUTRICIAN MINDING THEIR SOCIAL CONNECTIONS ET CETERA ET CETERA THE IDEA OF GOING STRAIGHT TO TESTOSTRON SIMPLY A BAD IDEA THAT SAID JUST LIKE WITH DEPRESSION AND ANSE TOR PRECENCE THERE IS A KIND OF A CLIFF AFTER WHICH A LOW ENOUGH TESTOSTRONE OR LOW ENOUGH SERATONE AND PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM SLEEPING EXERCISE SOCIAL CONNECTION ET CETERA SO I DO ONT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUT WITH THAT IN MIND HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT I'M PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY PERSCRIBE AND DIRECT YOUR PATIENTS IN TERMS OF HORMON REPLACEMENT THERE BE IN MEN PERSEN THEIR THIRTIES PERSON IN THEIR FORTIES WHOSE DOING ALMOST ALL THE OTHER THINGS CORRECTLY  WHAT SORTS OF LEVELS DO YOU THINK ARE MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THE RANGEIS TREMENDOUS IN TERMS OF BLOOD TEST THREE HUNDRED NANIGRAMS FOR DESLEADER I THING ON THE LOW AND NOW AN THE YOU AS ALL THE WAY UP TO NINE HUNDRED OR TWELVE HUNDRED THAT'S ENORMOUS RANGE WHAT ARE SOME THE OTHER HORMONS YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT ESTROGN D H T ANDSON SO IM YOU'LL LOT LOTS ON PACK THEIR SO IM LET START WITH THE RANGES RIT SO I'M THETHE THE RANGES YOU GAVE OR FOR TOTAL TESTSTRON OF COURSE AND WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THAT ATHE WAY WE USE THE WAY WE YOU KNOW I USE TO SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AT TOTAL AND FREE WHEN I HAD WHEN I USED MORE TRICKS TO MODULATE IT SO II'M ACTUALLY FAR MORE SIMPLE IN MY MANIPULATION OF TESTOSTRON TO DAY THAN I WAS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO I MEAN WE WERE YOU KNOW WE WOULD USE A MICRODOSE OF ANOVAR TO LOWER S H B G IN A PERSON WHO HAD NORMAL TESTOSTRON BUT LOW FREE TESTOSTRON BUT WHAT WAS EM THE LOW DOSE OF ANOVAR IN THAT CONTEXT TEN MELIGRAMS SUBLING TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK AN OF OUR BASICALLY BEING D H T A I OXANDER ALONE NOGAN HOS OTS EXACTLY IS  AGAIN WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING THIS AS ACTUALLY IF YOUR PLAYING A COMPETIVE SPORT CAN GET YOU BAND FROM THAT NO  I TAN ALSIS MAS IT CAN ALSO GET YOU BAND FROM HAVING CHILDREN IF YOU DO IT IN CORRECTLY YET SO SOAND A MICRODOSIV THIS HAS TO BE SMALL ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN'T IMPERIOR BODIES ABILITY TO MAKE TESTOSTRON BUT ANOVAR HAS SUCH A HIGH AFFINITY FOR S H B G THAT ADBASICALLY DISTRACTS YOUR ESAE TO BE EFROM BINDING YOUR TESTOSTRO FREEING UP TESTOSTAS EXACTE RIT SO SO THE GOAL WAS HOW DO I JUST GIVE YOU MORE FREE TESTOSTRON SO IF YOT PATIENT SHOWS UP AND THE'VE GOT A A TOTAL TESTOSTRON OF NINE HUNDRED NANGRAMS PER DESOLATOR WHICH WOULD PLACE THEM AT YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE SCALE YOU LOOK AT THE SKALE WE LOOK AT THAT WOULD PLACE YOU AT ABOUT THE SEVENTIETH PER CENTILE BUT YOU'RE FREE TESTOSTERON IS YOU KNOW EIGHT NANIGRAMS PER DESOLATOR SO THAT'S PRETTY BAD THAT MEANS YOUR LESS THAN ONE PER CENT FREE A GUI SHOULD BE ABOUT TWO PER CENT FRE T SO THAT DUED SHOULD BE CLOSER TO SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN NANIGRAMS PER DESOLATOR SO IN THAT SITUATIO THAT I JUST GAVE YOU HIS S H B G IS REALLY HIGH IS ES H B G IS PROBABLY IN THE EIGHTY TENINET RIN THAT'S VERY HIGH YETAS I THINK THE UPPER RANGE IS SOMEWHERE ROUND FIFTY FIVE FIFTY SIX X AM SO WE WOULD FIRST BAXSTALL FOR WHAT'S DRIVING IS ES H B G SO THE SPACELY THREE HORMONES SO GANETIS PLAYS A HUGE ROIN IS THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT JUST OUT OF THE BOX PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT LIKE SET POINT FOR ES H B G MINE ISN'T CRDLY LOW MY ES H B G IS LIKE KIND OF IN THE THIRTIES TWENTIES TO THIRTIES AM BUT FROM AE HORMON PERSPECTIVE THE'IS BASICALLY THREE HORMONES THAT RUN IT SO ESTRADIAL BEING PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT INSOLEN AND THIROX SO WE GE IN A LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE AND DECIDE IF ANY OF THOSE ARE PLAYING ROLE SO INSOLEN SUPPRESSES IT SO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE GREAT IRONY OF HELPING A PERSON GET METABOLICALLY HEALTHY IS IN THE SHORT RUN YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOWER THEIR FREE TESTOSTRONE ALL THINGS EQUAL BECAUSE AS INSOLEN COMES DOWN ESS H B G GOES UP AND IF TESTOSTRON HASN'T GONE UP WITH IT YOU'R LOWERING FREE TOSTOSTRONE SO SOMEBODY WHO GOES ON A VERY LOW CARBORHIDRA DIED AN ATTEMPT TO DROP SOME WATER AND DRUNK DROP SOME WEIGHT IS GOING TO INCREASE TEIR ES H B G AFTER INSLEN GOES BYING OT GUSTOSTRON LESS FREE TESTOSTRONE AM I CAN I CAN TELL THE CARNIVOR DIET PEOPLER CAN BECOMING AFTER ME WITH A WITH BONE MARROW IN HAND BUT THANYGON THAT AFTER THIS DISCUSSION EXTENDS ALL FURTHER I'M SURE THE VEGANS WILL BE COMING AFTER ME WITH CELERY STOCK SO ITS A A SO THEN THE SAME AS OF ESTRADILE SO EXCEPT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO HIGHER ESTRADIL IS HIGHER ES H B G I'M SO AGAIN OCCASIONALLY YOU'LL SEE A GUI WITH INCRET I NORMAL TESTOSTRONE BUT HE'S A VERY HIGH A ROMA TASTE ACTIVIT PERSON SO HE HAS A LOT OF THE ENDSI'ME THAT CONVERTS TESTOSTRONE INTO ESTRADIAL YOU CAN LOWER ESTRADIALL A BIT WITHIN A ROMATASE AND HIBITER AND THAT CAN BRING DOWN AS H B G NOW AGAIN THESE THINGS INDIVIDUALLY ARE RARELY ENOUGH TO MOVE THE NEEDLE THE LAST IS THIS DIROXI SO IF YOU HAVE A PERSON WHOSE TIRADE IS OUT O WACK YOU HAVE TO FIX THAT BEFOR YOU IF THEIR TFOR IS OUT O WACK YOU'RE GIN TO INTERFERE WITH S H B G THER'RE ALSO SOME SUPPLEMENTS WHICH I THINK YOU'VE PROPYTALKED ABOUT THESE ON THE PODCAST IF YEULK HAVE HEARD YOU TALK ABUT TESE ON A POD CAST YETHERE A FEW THAT WILL ADJUST THAT YOU NO THERE IS THIS IDEA NOW THERE'S A A MUCH BETTER REVIEW THAT JUST CAME OUT I'LL SEND AT YOU ID LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT AND IAVE BEEN PERUSING T A LINE BY LINE  BUT A LOVE IN PUT OM EXPERTS LIKE YOU ON A THE USE OF TONGA ALI FOR UDUSING ES  H B G IN MY EXPERIENCE IT DOES FREE UP SOME TESTOSTRONE BY WHICH MECHANISM IT ISN'T EXACTLY CLEAR AND THE EFFECTS AREN'T THAT DROMATIC  BY THEIR PROBABLY MULTIPLE EFFACTS O FOR ALL WE KNOW IT INCREASES LEBIDO AND IT DOES GENERALLY BY WAY OF INCREASING ESTROGENS LIGHTLY WHICH CAN ALSO INCREASELY BE KNOWN IN SOME INDIVIDUAL SO WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT MOTIVE OF ACTION WEVE TALKED ABOUT A FEW THE ONE THAT FEW YEARS BACK PEOPLE WERE CLAIMING BUT OVERD SS H B G WAS A A STINGING NETTLES AM STINGING NETTLE I LOLL JUST URIN SEEMS TO BE COTLER YOUR ANATING SEEMS TO BE COMNG UT MULTAL TIMES ON THE SPON CESTROM WHATEVER REASON A STING NETTLE EXTRECT I TOOK THE THA A MOST P PRONOUNCED EFFECT OF THAT WAS YOU COULD BASY EURN AN'T OVER A CAR AND WHEN TAKING ESSAGE B U WHAT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF THAT WAS I DO NOT KNOW I TOOK IT FOR A SHORT WHILE IT DIDN'T DROP MY S  B G VERY MUCH IM BUT IDID DROP BY D H T SUFFICIENTLY SO THAN I SAT A ON IT I DO NOT LIKE ANYTHING THAT IMPEDES T H T I I DON'T CARE IFR MY HAIRLINE RETREATS I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY THAT D H T TO ME IS SOMETHING TO BE UM OFITID AND HELD ON TO BECAUSE YOU FEEL SO MUCH BETTER WHEN YOUR D H T IS IN THE APPROPRIATE RANGE IN LOVERH THOUGHTS ON THAT YEE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE GUY AND IT DEPENDS ON WHAT RISK YOURE TRYING TO MANAGE RIGHT SO PROSTATE SIZE STARTS TO BECOME ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH T H T LUCKILY MY PROCITS S AGAN TO GN IS LOW IM INDH T I'M THE THINGS I NO CAN REDUCE IT OUR THINGS LIKE FINASTERI PROPCA THINGS IE A DASER RI THINGS TO THAT PEOPLE TAKE TO TRY AND AVOID HAIRLOSS CAN I'M DRAMATICALLY REDUCE T H T AND LEADS ALL SORTS OF TERRIBLE SECUAL SIDE EFFECTS MOOD BASSIDE EFFECTS ET CETERA BUT IM YESO I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING THEY BE TAKEN IN SUPPLEMENT FORM THAT CAN REALLY PROFOUNDLY DRY ANIND DD DON'T SPEND MUCH ATTENTION ON IT ANY MORE BASICALLY I USED TO HAVE A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS EIGHT YEARS AGO LIKE I I MEAN IT WAS I WOULD DRIVE PATIENTS NOTS WITH THE WHITEBOARD DIAGRIMS I WOULD DRAW FOR THEM WEN THIN THE AND I THINK THEY WERE JUST LIKE TO JUST PUT ANY TO TAKE I'M TO DAY WE TAKE IT MUCH MORE SIMPLE APPROACH SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS SHOULD YOU RE SHOULD YOU HAVE YOUR FREE TISTOSTRON BEING HIRED THAT'S THE METRIC I CARE ABOUT IS FREE TESTOSTRON IS THE FIRST MOST IMPORTANT THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT IS ESTRODIL AND STARTIN TROUBLE YOU SEIT IF YOU LOOK HERE TOTAL TESTOSTRON WANT THE FRE T TO BE ABOUT TWO PER CENT OF YOUR WILLIN SHOULD B RISO   I I MIGHT NOT CHANGE THAT ANY MORE SO IN OTHER WORDS IF A GUSE AT ONE PER CENT THEN I KNOW I HAVE TO REALLY BOOST HIS TOTAL TESTOSTRONE IF HE'S ONLY GOING TO GET ONE TO ONE AND A HALF PER CENT OF IT CONVERTED TO FREE ANAIN'T TO BOOSTUM AND MESHHI DON'T CARE IF HE'S OUTSIDE THE RANGE LIKE NOHOF A GU WHO'S FRE T I MIGHT HAVE TO GET A GUISE TOTAL T UP TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO GET HIS FRE T TO EIGHTEEN I SEES A FREE T IS THE TARGET I LIKE T IS OGTR AND D YOU STILL USE AN OF ORIC A IM IXAN SOR SORRY TO TRYING LOWER ESS H B GDO IT'S BECAUSE IT'S TOO POTENT NO BECAUSE IT S TOO COMPLICATED FOR PATIENTS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S AIT'S A DRUG THAT CAN'T BE TAKEN ORLY SO YOU VE TO TAKEIT UNDER THE TONGUE LIKE ESROCOR SOM RAY THAN AN I HAD ONE PATIENT ONES TO EVEN THOUG WE TOLD HIM ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN TIMES THAT HE WAS LIKE SWALLOWING THE AN OF OURS AND HIS LIVER FUNCTION AND HE WAS EKWARD TUG AN TEN MILIGRIMS THREE TIMES WEEK AS A HINY DOSE AND THREE MONTHS OF HIM OR WHATEVER TWO MONTHS OF HIM SWALLOWING THAT EVERY TIME TRIPPLED IS LIVER FUNCTION TAS OT'S LIKE IT'S JUST I WAS LIKE YOU KNW IT ITS JUST NOT WORTH TEHASSLE OF DOING THIS IM FUR YOU KNOW PERFECTION IN REALITY WE CAN FIX THIS ANOTHER WAY SO SO THE FIRST WORDER QUESTION IS DO WE BELIEVE CLINICALLY YOU WILL BENI IT FRUM NORMALLIZING YOUR FREE TISTOSTRON WERE TAKING IT TO A LEVEL THAT'S CALL IT EIGHTIETH TO NINETIETH PER CENT ALSO UPER NORMAL LIMIT OF PHYSIOLOGIC RANGES AM THAT'S THE FIRST WORT OF QUESTION AND THAT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO SYMPTOMS AND THAT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO SOME BIO MARKERS I THINK THERE'S AM TWO YEARS AGO ISTITU OR MAY BE A YEAR AGO VERY GOOD STUDY CAME OUT THAT LOOKED AT PREDIABATIC MEN YOU POBY TALKED ABOUT THIS STUDY AND LOOKING AT INSOLENT RESISTANCE AND GLUCOS A DISPOSAL WITHIN WITHOUT TESTOSTRON AND THE EVIDENCE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR A TESTOSTERON IMPROVES A GLASEEMIC CONTROL TISTOSTRON IMPROVES INSLEN SIGNING THIS SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISING BY THE WAY GIVEN THE ROLL MUSCLES PLAY AS HE GLUCOS RES OF ORNIGLUCO SING SO NOW I INCLUDE THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WILL CONSIDER AS A FACTOR FOR USING TISTOSTRON NOW AGAIN IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE SO YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT WITH EXERCISE YOU TO COMPRESCIPE THESE OF THE THINGS BUT THEN YOU GET INTO A LITLE BUT OF THE VICIOUS CYCLE OF WILL HAVING ANORMALIZED TEISTSTRON FACILITATE YOU DOING THOSE THINGS BETTER SO LET'S JUST ASSUME WE COME TO THE DECISION THAT THIS THIS THIS PERSON IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FRUIT FOR TESTOSTRON PLACEMENT THERAPY THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE METHOD WE'RE GOING TO DO IT ORE WE GOING TO DO IT INDIRECTLY OR DIRECTLY NOW WE USED TO USE A LOT OF CLOMED IN OUR PRACTICE AAND HAVE YOU TALKED ABOUT CLOMEON I TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT IT A A NO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE TAKING THINGS LIKE AN ASTRAS ALL TO REDUCE A ROMATAS ACTIVITY RUN CAN PETENTIALLY RUN INTO TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY THINK O WELL MORE TESTOSTRON GOOD LOWER ESTUGIN BAD AND THEN THE AND UP WITH ISSUES LIKE JOINT PAYING MEMORY ISSUES AND SEVERE DROPS IN LABIDO AND I THINK A LOT OF THE REAN  EVEN EPHATIC HUMULATION SO IF ESTEROGEN IS TOO LOW YOU YOULL YOU CAN DEVELOP AT APOSITY IN A WAY THAT YOU WOULDN'T OTHERWISE ERWAS A GREAT NUMEN JOURNAL PAPER 'S PROBY TEN YEARS OLD NOW THAT LOOKED AT FY I BELOSE FIVE DIFFERENT DOSES IF TESTOSTRON CIPIANATES SO THESE MEN WERE CHEMICALLY CASTRATED AND DIVIDED INTO TEN GROUPS 'S PRETTY REMARKABLE SOMEBODY STENTED OUT FOR THE STUDY E SO YOU WERE WITHIN WITHOUT AN ASTRAS ALL AND FIVE DOSES OF TESTSTRON SO NOW YOU BASICALLY HAD FIVE TISTOSTRON LEVELS PLOSERMINE US HIGH OR LOW ESTRADIALL AND THE RESULTS WERE REALLY CLEAR THAT THE HIGHER YOUR TESTOSTERON AND THE MORE YOUR ESTRODALE WAS IN KIND OF THAT THIRTY TO FIFTY RANGE THE BETTER YOU WERE SO IF ESTEROGEN WAS TOO LOW EVEN THE PRESENCE OF HIGH TISTOSTRO THE OUTCOMES WERE WERE A LESS SIGNIFICANT AND THIS IS THIRTY TO FIFTY NANOGRAMS PRDESTILY AR NOT THIRY FIFTY PRERCENT OF YOUR O ONCE TESTOSTRON GR  OK AS TO WE HAVEN'T TALGHT ABUT CLOMETT IS NO WE HAVE NOT TALKED A LOT ABOUT CLOMEDAD LEFT TO GET YOUR THOGHTS ON CLOMEN SO CLOMPHINE IS A FERTILITY DRUG IT'S A SYNTHETIC HORMON IT'S EXTLY TWO DRUGS M CHLONOPHINE AND I FORGET THE OTHER ONE AND IT TELLS THE PETUITARY ATOO SECRETE AFFASATION EL AGE SO YOU AD SO THE ADVANTAGE OF OF CLOMED IS ITS ORAL AND IT'S MEANT TO BE TAKEN ORALLY SO YOU KNOW A TYPICAL STARTING DOSE WOULD BE LIKE FIFTY MELIGRAMS THREE TIMES A WEEK AND IF YOU DO THAT YOU'LL NOTICE IN MOST MEN ESPECIALLY YOUNG MEN EFFASATIA ELACH GOES UP IN ANY MAN THE EFFASATION ALLAGE GO UP BUT IF A MAN STILL HAS TO STICCULAR RESERVE HE'LL MAKE LOTS A TISTOSTRON IN RESPONSE TO THAT IM CAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST ORDER QUESTION WE'RE TRYING TO ANSWER IS DO YOU IS YOUR FAILURE TO MAKE TESTOSTRON CENTRAL OR PRIFRAL AND I THINK A SWUMP WENT OUT GAN CRECT ME FOM ALL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A LOT OF THE DRUGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IM THE SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS TO STOSTRO AN ASTROGEN THINGS I RELATE TO GROWTHOR WEN ET CETERA WE'RE DISCOVERED AND DESIGNED IN ORDER TO TREAT AND ESCUS ME IN ORDER TO ICILAT AND TREAT EXACTLY THESE KINDS OF SINDRUMS WEATHER NOT IT WAS TEHIOTHALMIS THE PATUITARY OR THE TARGET TISSUE THE OTHE OVERIS OR TH OR THE TESTIES CORRECT YA I MEAN I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING THIS IS JUST GIVE THE HORMON THAT'S THAT'S MISSING WITHOUT ATTENTION TO WERE ITS WHERE THE DEFICIENCY IS WHY THIS BECOMES RELEVANT IS IF YOU HAVE A THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD GUY WHOSE TUSTOSTRON IS LOW BUT YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S LOW BECAUSE HE'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH OF A SIGNAL FROM THE PATUITARY WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER GIVING HIM MORE TIESTOSTRON WHEN HE HAS THE CAPAT HE HAS THE LAT EXGCELLS MISTER TOOLY SELLS TO MAKE TISTOSRON HE JUST NEDS THE SIGNAL IM SOMETIMES THOUGH NOT ALWAYS JUST A COURSE OF CLOMATE CAN WAKE HIM UP AND HE'S HE'S BACK TO MAKING NORMAL TISTOSTROM SO HE DO THIS THREE TIMES WEAT FIFTY MILL THAT FIFTY MELIGRAMS THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR A SHORT COURSE AND THE WED DO IT FOR EIGHT TO TWELVE WEEKS AND THEN WE REEVALUATE AND ESTROGEN AND TIESTOSTRON WILL INCREASE IN IN PARALLEL YES AND AGAIN IT DEPENDS YOU KNOW A ROMATACES ACTIVITY IS DEPENDENT ON HOW MUCH BODY FATH YOU HAVE AND GENETICS IM AND IF ESTRODILE GETS TWO HUY WE THINK IF IT GETS OVER ABOUT FIFTY FIVE SIXTY WE WILL GIVE MICRODOSES OF AN ASTROSALL BUT IT HAS TO BE REAL MICRODOSES I MEAN YOU CANNOT POUND PEOPLE WITH AN ASTROSALTY TO GIVE YOU PERSPECTIVE THE THE THE SORT OF ON LABEL USE LIKE IF YOU JUST GO TO A PARMACY AN ORDER AND ASTROSLAL YOU'REGON TO GET ONE MELIGRAM TABLETS LIKE WE CAN'T GIVE ANYBODY A MELIGRAM AN THEY'LL FEEL LIKE GARMENT IWE WE HAVE TO HAVE IT COMPOUNDED AT POINT ONE MELIGRAMS AND WE MIGHT GIVE A PATIENT POINT ONE TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK THAT WOULD BE A BIG DOSE OF AN ASTROSALL I THINK THAT THE TYPICAL TIARTY CLINEC OUT THERE IS GIVING TWO HUNDRED MELIGRAMS PROMIL ONE MILL TO INTER MELIGRAMS OF TESTOTRO ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS AND THEN HITTING PEOPLE WITH AM MULTIPLE MELIGRAMS OF THAN ASTRS ALL AND THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE 'VE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD AM AND I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED BUT IT'S CUNNIT BLOWS MY MIND THAT THESE TART CLINICS ARE UP ALL OVER THE PLACE GIVEN HOW BAD I MEAN I SEE THE RESULTS CAUSE I HAVE PATIENTS THAT COME FROM THEM AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE WYTHER SO IN COMPETENT I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S WORSE TIN THAT I THINK THAT THEY SIMPLY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND DON'T CARE BECAUSE IT'S A A PILLMILL AND IT'S A MONEY MILL I THINK THAT DOWT IS IT SEEMS ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO'S DOING TART IS TAKI ING LOWER DOSES MORE FREQUENTLY EVERY OTHER DAY OR TWICE A WEEK DIVIDING THE DOSE AND BEING VERY VERY CAREFUL WITH THESE ESTROGEM OR ROMATASTE BLOCKERS AM WE WE WE MOST OF OUR PATIENTS DO NOT TAKE A ROMATASES INHIBITERS IT'S NOT NEEDED IT'S REALLY ONLY THE HIGH AROMATIZERS THAT NEED IT I'M AND SO YET WHEN WE'LL ALK ABOUT TESTOSTRON WILL TALK ABOUT DOSING THERE CAUSE I AGREE THE MORE FREQUENTLY YOU CAN TAKE IT THE BETTER AND RAN FRANKLY DON'T NEED TO GO MORE FREQUENTLY THAN TWICE A WEEK IS IT'S SO SLA I YET ET THE HALF LIFE OF THE DRUG IS S I THINKIT'S ABOUT THREE AND A HALF DAYS IS THE PLOSMA HLF LIFE FOR OMETHING LIKE HI CAN BE OFF LITLE BIT BUT BUT TWICE WEEK DOSING IS IS REALLY NICE SOFYOUR IF IF YOU IF IF YOU GO TO THE YOU KNOW TOSTOSTROM CLENICT THIT'S GIVING YOU TWO HUNDRED EVERY TWO WEEKS FIFTY TWICE A WEEK IS THE SAME TOTAL DOSE WHICH BY THEWAY IS A PHYSIOLOGIC DOBS THAT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE SOMEBODY ANY OF THE SIDE EFFECTS YOU WOULD SEE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ACNEY WITH THAT YOU'RE NOCKING A GET KIND A CAMASS YA YOU'RE NOT GINNG GAT INGYTHNGS THE ONLY REAL SIDE EFFECT YOU GET FROM THAT IS YOU WILL GET TESTICULARATROPHY THAT'S ENOUGH TO SUPPRESS YET TO MAINTAIN A FERTILITY WHAT HA OUTYPICALLY DUE FOR LELSIS ITIIS WHERE SO I'LL FINISH THE STORY ON CLOMET CAUSE WE CURRENTLY DO NOT USE CLOMET AND THAT'S THAT'S AM DUE TO A REALLY INTERESTING OBSERVATION THAT IM WE WE MADE THAT I DON'T THINK HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE YET WHICH IS THAT CLOMED WAS INCREASING LEVELS OF A STARAL THAT WE ALLSO HAPPEN TO MEASURE CALLED DESMOSTRAL NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT SO IN THE IN THE IN THE WAY THAT CLUSTERALL IS MADE IT'S MADE BY A THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS THAT MAKE CLESTRAL SO IT STARTS WIK WITH YOU KNOW TWO CARBONS UV OU I SIC ASEALOKOAY AN A COUNTER MARCH IS DOWN A PATHWAY BYFR CATES AND CLESTRALL IS THE FINISHED PRODUCT OF BOTH BUT IN ONE OF THOSE PATHWAYS THAT THE MOTHEMOLECULL RIHE BEFORE CLESTRALL IS CALLED DOES MOSTRAL AN THE OTHER PATHWAYTS CALLED LETHLOSTRAL SO WE CONSTANTLY MEASURE LETHOSTRAL AND DESMOSTRAL BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH CLESTRALL IS BEING SYNTHASIZED IN THE BODY NOT JUST WHAT YOU'RE CLESTRAL IS WE WONT NW HOW MUCH CLESTRAL YOU REABSORBE AND THOSE MARKERS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO US WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT CARDYOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK SO WHEN WE GAVE PATIENTS CLOMED WE WERE NOTICING A ALMOST UNIVERSAL RISE IN THEIR DESMOSTRAL LEVELS NOW THE MOST OBVIOUS EXPLANATION FOR THAT THOUGH I THE LAST TIME I LOOKED I COULDN'T FIND CLEAR EXPLANATION FOR THIS IN ANY OF THE CLENICAL LIKE THE CLENICAL TRIALS THAT LED TO THE APPROVAL OF CLOMET SO I DON'T KNOWIF IT WAS DESCRIBE IN FACT MAYBE IT WASN'T KNOWN I SUSPECT IT IS INHIBITING THE ENDS I'M WHICH I THINK IT'S CALLED DEL TA TWENTY FOUR DYSATURATE THAT TURNS DESMOSTRAL INTO CLESTRAL MAKE SENSE IF YOU INHIBIT THAT ENDS I'M YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ARISE IN DESMOSTRAL THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A CONCERN TO ME IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT TOM DAYSPRING HO'S ONEOF THE PHYSICIANS WE WORK WITH OS ONE OFTHE WORLD'S EXPERTS IN LIPIDS POINTED OUT A VERY OBSCURE STORY WHICH WAS THAT THE VERY FIRST DRUG EVER R APPROVED TO TREAT CARDY OF ASCULAR DISEASE AT LEAST TO TREAT HYPER CLUSTROLEMIA WAS A DRUG THAT ATTACKED THE SAME ENZINE A SO THIS THIS THIS IS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES I BELIEVE MAYBE THE MID SIXTIES THIS DRUG WAS APPROVED AND IT LOWERED CLUSTERAL ANDIT WAS APPROVED ON THE BASIS OF LOWERING CLUSTRO NOW TO DAY NO DRUG FOR A  C V D IS APPROVED ON THE BASIS OF IT LOWERING CLUSTRL THAT'S NOT A HIGH ENOUGH B YOU HAVE TO REDUCE EVENTS EXHEFTO SHOW THAT YOUR PREVENTING HART ATTACKS AND DEATH BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS LIKE HATE LOR'S CLUSTROLTS GOT TO BE GOOD WELL IN LATE SIXTIES IT WAS PULLED FROM THE MARKET BECAUSE EVENTS WERE GOING UP SO CLUSTRALL WAS COMING DOWN EVENTS WERE GOING UP HOW COULD THAT BE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE SUSPECTING IS THAT DOES MOSTRAL WHICH IS STILL A STARALL WAS POTENTIALLY MORE DAMAGING AND CRATED MORE OXIDATE OF STRASS IN THE END OF THELIUM IN THE SUBBENTHEDIAL SPACE THAN CLUSTRO ISE WHICH WULD AT LEAST SUGGEST TO US AND AGAIN WE'RE TAKEN A LOT OF LEAPS HERE THAT MAYBE HAVING HIGH DAS MOSTRALL VERY HIGH DAS MOSTROL IS IS NOT A GOOD THING AND SO ONCE WE CON A PIECTALL LET TOGETHER A FEW YEARS AGO WE WERE LIKE THE AT WHIRE JUS NOT CANA PRESCRIBE CLOMAT ANY MORE IM AND WE THEN SWITCH TO H C G WHICH WE USED TO USE SOMETIMES INSTEAD OF CLOMED BUT IT'S MORE CUMBERSOME TO WORK WITH IT NEEDS TO BE REFRIGERATED IT'S A MUCH MORE FRAGILE MOLECULE  I THINK WE TALGKET ABOU THIS ONCE IS ALMOST LIKE A  IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY A KNOCK OVER THE LITTLE A BOTTLE IT'S BASICALLY GONE BAD YAL WITH IT AS IS VERY RATI WITH IT A IT'S A NEEDLE NOTES AN INJECTION SUBCU SO EASY TO ADMINISTER IT'S NOT I AM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT IT JUS MORE OF A HASTEL FACTOR AM BUT THAT SAID IT HAS THE BENEFIT THAT CLOMED DOES WHICH IS IT PRESERVES TESTICULAR FUNCTION IT PRESERVES TESTICULAR VOLUME SO YOU DON'T BODY BILDERS WILL OFTEN USE THIS IN THEIR POCYCHAEL THERAPY AS TA WAITER CAN HAVE RECOVER FUNCTION AND WE WOULD JUST USE IT NOW AS O'M GOING THERAPY FOR A GUY WHO STILL HAS TESTICULAR RESERVE SO ON ITS OWN NO TESTOSTRO NO AROMATASTE IN HIBITOR NOTHING JUST AWAITIT CRANK OUT A BIT MORE TESTOSTRON FROM THE TESTES MAYBE SOME YETIONAL EIN IN ALL H C GS A DIFFERENT MODEL ASH C G IS JUST AN ANALOGUE OF LUTINIZING HORMON SO IT'S BASELY LIKE GIVING THEM LUTINIING HORMON SO IT'S GOOIN TO CRUSH INDOGINIS LUTINIZING HORMONMOMOSRIHT BECAUSE ACTUALLY A YAN INIT IM YOU DON'T REALLY SEE MUCH OF BEEN IMPACT ON LL H BUT YOU DO SEE AND DOGENIS TOSTOSTRON PRODUCTION GO DOWN I SHI IT NOT CORRECT THAT BOTH AFFISATION ELATE WILL GO DOWN ON A HIGH ENOUGH DOS  A JUST AS A MANSION AND HERE I'M NOT MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ONE SUPPLEMENT I'VE TALKE TO LOT ABOUT A PUBLICLY IS FIDOGIA ADRESTUS WHICH IS THIS WEIRD NIGURIAN SHRUB THA THAT A DAUS THET THE SOMETIMS BOUS ON TINSPOCASTIN JO'S PODCAST AND AM YOU KNOW THERE WAS A BIT OF A BACK LASH BECAUSE IT DOES TURN OUT THAT AT HI DOSES IN ROD STUDIES IT CAN CAUSE A SOME TOXTICITY THE TESTIES BUT A AT LOWER DOSES IT DOES SEEM TO INCREASE LUINIZING HORMON AND AFTER TALKING ABOUT THIS NUMBER OF HE ONE OUT THEIRE DID PRENE POST BLOOD WORK AND THE THEY CONSISTENT EFFACT SEEMS TO BE AN INCREASE IN LUTINIZING HORMON THERE'S A NOTICEABLE EFFACT ON TESTA TESTICULAR SIZE AND VOLUMES A LOT OF YEU WLL TAKE IS TOT GO YOU KNOW THERE THE BALLS ARE GETTING BIGGER AND SO THEY GET ALL EXCITED THAT SOMETHING GOOD AS HAPPENING UM BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT LONG TERM SAFETY IN EFFICACY OF SOMETHING LIKE FIDOGIO WEATHER NOT EAS BESIDE YETHIS IS THAT I I'M I'M ALSO VERY LEARY OF THE SUPPLEMENTS IN THIS SPACE BECAUSE AT LEAST WHEN WE'RE USING H C G OR TOSTASTERON LIKE WE HAVE SO MANY YEARS OF DATA YOU NOI'T REMEMBER HOW MANY WOMEN ARE USING THIS STUFF FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE SO OUNOW I THINK THE F T I THE T HAS A LOT OF FAULTS I I THINK I HAVE AN ENTIRE PODCAST DEVOTED TO  THE CORRUPTION OF THE F TE AND ALL OF THE MISTAKES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE WITH RESPECT TO THEY'RE OVER SITE IN ESPECIALLY GENERIC DRUGS BUT IT'S WAY MORE REGULATED THAN THE WILD WILD WEST OF NIGTY SUPPLEMENT LAND ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT THE REASON FOR TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE TONGUE OUT UP FIDOGIA WAS TO PROVIDE SOME INTERMEDIATE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DOING ALL THE CORRECT THINGS BUT NO SUPPLEMENTATION OR HORMON THERAPE AND THEN GOING STRAIGHT TO HORMON THERE  SORT OF LIKE TO LEAP FROM I CAN'T FOLKIS VERY WELL TO RIDDLEIN RIGHT WITHOUT AA REAL DIGNOSIS OF EIGHTY H S TO OH ELL MAKE YOU SOME THINGS LIKE ALPHAG PC LOW DOSES OF NICETINE RIGHT BUT I AGREE ENTIRELY I MEAN THE SORCING IS IMPORTANT THE DOSAGES ARE ARE WORKED OUT EMPIRICALLY ON INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND THERE AREN'T RANAMIZE CONTROL TRIALS THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST ARNT YYOU DON'T HAVE KIND OF LIKE A SEVEN THIS ANOTHER PETER PRINCIPAL RIGHT SO I'LLGET A LOT OF PATIENTS THAT COME INTO THE PRACTICE AND YOUR DURING OUR INTAKE WE GO THROUGH WHAT IT WHAT DRUGS AND SUPPLEMENTS R YOU TAKING RIGHT NOW AND NLOT PEOPLE COME IN O'RE NOT TAKIN ANYTHING PETER I JUST YOU'RE INT YOU'REIN CHARGE NOW LIKE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK AND THEN YOU GET LOK PEOPLE THAT COME IN AN THE'RE LIKE EGAN NEED NEXT A FEW PAGES FOR THIS PART OF THE DOCUMENT I SHE BLUE TRAVEL WITH THE SUIT CASE YO CAN HEAR AS THEY WALK THROUGH THE OWRING ALL THE PILLS AND I'M SO I GIVE THESE PATIENTS A LITTLE HOMEWORK EXERCISE WHICH IS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THESE SEVEN QUESTIONS FOR EVERY SUPPLEMENT YOU TAKE AND HERE'S THE SPREAD SHEET AND LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AND IT BASICALLY JUST RUNS THROUGH LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BASICALLY WALKING YOU THROUGH THE LOGIC OF WHY DO YOU TAKE THIS MOLIC YOU WILL AND IM I THINK FOR MANY PEOPLE IT'S WHEN THEY DO THAT IT'S VERY SOBERING RIGHT THEY KIND OF THE LOT O THEM WILL COME BACK AND BE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T THINK I CAN COME UP WITH ANY REASON ALONG THIS REALLY RIGOROUS LINE OF THINKING AS TO WHY I'M TAKING EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE STUFF I KNOW PEOPLE AND ACT YOU WE NOSE ON THE SAME PEOPLEERE FANATIC ABOUT LIKE RED LIKE RED LIGHT ON THE TESTIS SUNNING THEIR TESTIS UM PUTTING ICE PACKS ON THEIR TESTIS IS HAVE ALL OVER THE PLACE THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING AND DOING IN ORDER TO INCREASE TESTOSTRON OUT BUT FROM THEIR TESTISES PRETTY REMARKABLE AND THAT SAID AM AMONG SOME OF THE WOMEN I KNOW THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING TO TRY IND PROMOTE LONGEVITY AND FERTILITY AND IN PARTICULAR SKIN IN HEALTH HERE HEALTH AND NAIL HEALTH ITS ALSO KIND OF OUTRAGES EVERYTHING FROM OLLEGENT O RED LIKE THERAPIES WHICH MAY ACTUALLY HAVE SOME ETHICASIIN CERTAIN CASES BUT AM IT'S AN INTEREST THER DE HIDER THERE I HEL FOR SURE IM ONE OF THE THNGS THAT I HOPE GETS A LOT MORE ATTENTION IS THE USE O RAP A MICE AND FOR PRESERVING A VARY IN HEALTH SO THE ANIMAL LITERATUREON THIS IS PRETTY PRETTY IMPRESSIVE RIGHT SO IN MOUSE MODELS RAP A MICE AND WILL PRESERVE OF A OF I AVERIIN LIFE AND SO AND MAKE SENSE RIGHT A MIN IT THOTALLY MAKE SENSE WHY THE MOST POTENT GERO PROTECTIVE MOLECULE WE HAVE WOULD ALSO PRESERVE AND EXTEND OVARYIN LIFE AT LEAST IN MICE SO AM I'D LOVE TO SEE THE CLENNICAL TRIALS DONE IN IN IN WOMEN TO TEST THES HYPOTHESIS I DEFLY WONE TO COME BACK TO THIS IS US A A KEY THING I KNOW THE LOT OF YOU WOR JUST IN FEMALE FERTILITY OUT THERE AM WHON THEIR MALE PARTNERS SO AM GOING BACK TO SO NOW I UNDERSON WHY YOU DON'T PRESCRIBE CLOMOPHINE BECAUSE OF THIS A THIS MOSTERALL I POTENTIAL DISMOSTERALL LINK AM WHAT ABOUT TISTOSTRON THERBESO LEST AS E FREQUENT LOWER DOSE IS A LESS LESS IT OR NO ESTROGEN IN MISSIEN OR ROMICAGAIN A BIT ONLY ONLYWERE ONLY USING AN A ROMATASTE BLOCKER AND WE USE A REMATICS WHEN WE DO IT'S JUST A IS JUST TO GET THAT ESTRODILE INTO THE RANGE WE WANT I LIKE TO SEE IT BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY  THAT THAT'S THE SWEET SPOT AND A I DON'T NOW I WOULD SAY LIKE A THIRD MAYBE A NOT EVEN A THIRD IT' SAY PROBY TWENTY PER CENT OF MEN REQUIRE A MICRODOSE OF NASTERAS ALL TO GET INTO THAT RANGE MOST DO NOT AIM AND I'D RATHER AIR ON THE SIDE O BEING A LITTLE HIGH THAN A LITTLE LOW SO I NEVER REALLY ONE TO BE BELOW TWENTY FIVE IF UNLESS SOMETIMES ITS JUST BELOW TWENTY FIVE AN IT IS IT IS WHAT IT IS THAT'S FINE BUT BUT IF WE'RE SUPPRESSING IT TO BELOW TWENTY FIVE I NEVER WANT TO BE IN THAT ZONE A AND THEN YES SO TEOR TA IS ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW GIVING TOSTOSTERA RINCIPIENATE IS USUALLY WHAT WE USE INJACTABLESOS WAS A CREAMER PELET CORRECT AIM I USE TO USE PELETES WITH WOMEN AM FOR SOME WHO WERE REALLY ADIMATE ABOUT THE CONVENIENCE OF IT BUT FOR A BUNCH OF REASONS I I' JUST I'M I'M MOSTLY NOT DOING THAT AND I'VE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF PELETES IN MEN AM CAN'T CONTROL THE DOSEIG ONCE I ANAR I KNOW THE DOSE YET THAT'S IMUSE PROBLEM BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A BIG DIFFENCE IN PUTTING A PELETE INTO A MAN AND A WOMAN SO WHENYOU'RE PUTTING A ESTROGEN PELET INTO A WOMAN IT'S LIKE IT'S THAT BIG WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING ENOUGH PELETES INTO A MAN FOR SIX MONTHS OF TESTOSTERON IT'S TWO SUMS OF PELETES THAT ARE LONGER THAN MY FINGERS SO YOU'RE PUTTING LIKE A V PUTTING THIS  PUTTING IT INTO THE A GLUDIAL FAT SO I'S JUST IS JUST A MORE MORBID PRECEDURE AND I D ONDEMLY IS NECESSARY I THINK OF YOU IF YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE IT YOU KNOW THROUGH THROUGH SORT OF THE INJECTIONS AND NOW SAS ROBY YAPWILL ESPECIALY NOW F YOU'R DOING YOU KNOW WORTH HAVING THEM DO SUBCUE INJECTIONS ANYWAY SO IT'S NOT I AM THEY'RE USING A FIVE EIGHTS INCH TO ONE INCH TWENTY FIVE GAGE NEEDLE WHICH IS BUT THE SMALLEST NEEL YOU CAN PUSH THE OIL THROUGH IM WONCE THE TWICE A WEEK DEPENDING ON AND BYTHE WAY IF THEE REAL NEEDLE FOLKS WE USE ZIASTEAD WHICH IS A PRELOADED PEN AND ARE YOU HAVING ALL MEN TAKE H C G TO MAINTAIN FERTILITY AND TONLY O US TO GOT IT AND BY THE WAY WE DO NOT LIKE TO USE T R T AND MEN WHOSE WE DON'T LIKE TO USE TESTOSTRN SPECIFICALLY AND MEN WHO STILL WANT TO MAINTAIN FERTILITY WE JUST STEER THEM AWAY FROM THAT BECAUSE TOTALSPURM COUNTELIS AT WE UST SAY WHY RIS LIKE WE RATHER USE H C G YETUS ON ITSE YET JUST WAIT JUST WAIT TILL OU'RE DONE REPRODUCING BANKSFIRM WAIT TILLYOU'RE DONE REPRODUCING BEFORE WE GO TO TESTOSTRON UM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BENEFITS AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE A CAUTIONARY NOTES WITH APPROPRIATE TIART MEANING OF THE ON A CONTRARY RE TALKING ABOUT HERE A LOWER DOSE WITH THE YES OR NO LO ASTERGAM CONTROL UM PEOPLE WHAT IT GENERALLY PEOPLE REPORT HOW TO THEY FEEL A WHAT'S ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT THEY CAN I'M DOER FEL BEFORE AND THEN IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE MARKERS TO LOOK FOR IS THET ELL YELL BLOOD PRESSURE A WATER ATTENTION ACNEY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS OTHER SOME OTHER THING YET  ONS AN THE DOSIS REDAMIAND AGAIN WE'RE USING THESE AND REALLY LOW DOSE SO IT'S PRETTY RARE THAT WE'D HAVE A PATIENT ON MORE THAN A HUNDRED MELIGRAMS A WEEK OF TISTOSERON I'M I THINK FOR COMPARISON LIKE A BODY BUILDER COULD EASILY TAKE FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DURING A HIGH GROWTH PHASE I KNOW SOMEBODYES GUIS THEY THEY GO BELISTIC OR THEYI'RE DOING MODERATE LEVELS OF ZESTOSTRON CIPPI NAE BUT THEY'RE ALLSO TAKING DIANAB ALEXANDER ALONE I YOU KNOW SARMS AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS THEY ASK THEMMING TEIR STACKS ARE KIND OF RIDICULOUS I MAN THAT NOT NO DIST RESPECT TOF THAT POR IT BUT I MEAN PEOPLE A TIME RIGT  CRAZY AND THAT SPORT SIDES OUTSIDE OF PHYSIOLIGYYEN I SENT FOR NINETY NINE PER CENT PEOPLE LISTENING THEY JUST THEY LOOK THE HEAR BODY BUILDER IN THEY SLIKE WY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THAT ANYWAY RIGHT I THINK THAT'S THE TIPITO WIT IN ALSO THROUG THE POINT IS A LOT OF BUT BUT WE OWE THOSE GUIES A GREAT DEAL OF GRATITUDE CAUSE THEY'VE SHOWN US THE BOUNDARIES INCLUDING THE WOMEN THAT'S RIGHT  Y NOW  AND SO SO SO THOSE THOSE BODY BUILDERS HAVE TAUGHT US A LOT ABOUT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS AND SO Y THE THE TEBLOTING THE WATER ATTENTION ACNEY HAIR LOST HAIR GROWTH ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH OF IT IS WE JUST DON'T SEE THOSE THINGS IN OUR PATIENTS THAT A HUNDRED MELIGRAMS FOR WEEK IS A VERY LOW ILL PUT MIN IS TH TH TISIA OJECT OS ME YOUR OUI VIS ITS ENOUGH FOR HOUSE PEOPLE MEAN THERE'S PROBLY THE HIGHEST WE'VE EVER HAD TO GO AS MAY BE SEVENTY TWICE A WEEK WHAT'S THE YOUNGEST PATIENT YOU'VE EVER HAD TO PUT EM ON TER T ACTUAL TESTOSTEROM PWILLWY ASK APRE SOMETHING ABOT MAYBE MAYBE FORTY I THINK THAT'S GRAT FOR PEOPLE TO HERE ECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE LOTYAS IN THEIR TWENTIES ARE THINKING TO AR TEES THE WAY TO GO AT I WOULD ARGUE LESS YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING ELSE RI TIN YOU'R STILL HYPROCAN ADLEN YOU REALLY STRUGGLING PUT THAT PUT THAT TIME OFF BECAUSE ALL SO THE FERTILITY ISSUE YOU WANT TO DELAY WWELL I GAN ITS PENCIVE WOOD WHEN WE SAY TO OR T IF YOU'RE IN YOU'RE TWENTIES AND THERE'S NO OTHER WAY I WOULD I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD BE STEERED TOWARD H C G TO AT LEAST PRESERVE TO CICULAR FUNCTION OU AGAIN WE DON'T ACTURALLY KNOW IF AFTER BEING ON H C G FOR TEN YEARS YOU ARE PETUITARY WELL STILL WORK T YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE YOUR OWN LUTNINS  EXACTLY SO SO IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING UPSTREAM OF THAT LIKE CLOMED TO KICK STARTED AND THEN WE'RE BUT AGAIN I WON'T I DN'T WANT ANYBODY USE LESSING O THIS WHO'S USING CLOMET FOR FERTILITY TO THINK THAT THERE'S ANYTHING ON  I WAS MY CONCERN OVER THIS BECAME LIKE IF YOU'REGIN TO BE ON THIS FOR TEN YEARS IS AT PROBLEMATIC NOT IF YOU'RE USING THIS FOR A COURSE OF IVY A FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO  SO AGAIN IIF IF IF WE FELT THAT SOME ONE'S PETUITARY WAS NOT WORKING I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PUT THREE MONTHS OF CLOMET ON THEM TO CAN O TRYTOSE IF WE COULD BLAST OF THAT DO YOU HAVE MEN CYCLE ON AND OFF TESTOSTRONE AT THESE LOW DOSE AS YOU ARE THEY TAKING MONTH VACATION FROM IT AN ROBS EAN WHOLLY DEPENDS IN O SOCN OF PATIENT YESTERDAY WERE E'RE GING TO TOO WE JUST DESUCH CHANGE OF CYCLE EIGHT WEEKS ON THAN EIGHT WEEKS ON H C G EIGHT WEEKS ON AND EIGHT WEEKS ON H C G SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A CYCLE BUT MAINTAINS HIS TESTOSTRONE LEVEL BUT FLUCTUATES BETWEEN ANDOGENIS EXOGENIS AND OGIS EXOGNES SOMETIMES WE'LL JUST DO TOSTOSTRONE ON OFF ON OFF AND THERE IT'S LIKE HOW MUCH CAN HE REPLENISH NATURALLY BUT UNDERSTANDING HIS TEA WILL DIP DURING THOSE OFF CYCLES SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE FOR SOMEBODY TO DEVELOP A MOLECULE THAT CAN DIRECTLY TARGET S H B G BESIDES OXANDANIMA RIGHT IF YOU ONE COULD JUST DROP A AH B G JUST THE TINIEST BIT SEEMS LIKE ONE COULD ADJUST THE FRE T UM IN IT IN A WAY THT WOULD BE GREAT I DO'T KNOW WHY THAT MOLECU'LL SO HARD TO TARGET BUT SOMEBODY OUGHT TO DO IT CAN YE THREE P AAN TAT I  TOCK WITH PATRIC ARNOLD ABOUT THIS MANY MANY YEARS AGO IM WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHAT HIS I  HE HAD A COMMENT ABOUT THIS THAT AT THE TIME MADE SENSE I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CAUSE I I HAD THAT THOUGHT TO LIKE MAN BE ESPECIALLY FOR THAT SUBSET OF GISE YOU HAVE NORMAL TESTOSTRON BUT THEY'RE JUST OVERBINDING IT REALLY GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THIS ISSUE OF TOTAL TESTOSTRON VERSES FREE T AND THE REASON IS IL NEVER SINCE GOING ON PODCAS AND TALKING ABOUT THI STUFF AND TIME MO ON THIS PODCAST A PEOPLE WILL SEND ME THEIR NUMBERS THEY'LL SEND ME THEIR CHARTS AND THEN THEYLL SEND PHOTOES OF THEMSELVES AND I CAN TELL YOU WHILE I' NOT A CLINITION AND HAVENG DONE FANCY STATISTICS ON IT THERE'S VERY LITTLE CORRELATION BETWEEN SOME ONE'S ABSOLUTE TESTOSTRONE AND HOW THEY APPEAR I MEAN SOMETHESE GUIS LOOK YUREALLY LEAN REALLY STRONG AND THEYLL SAY OH TOTAL TESTOSTRONE IS FIVE FIFTY FOR EIGHTY RIGHT AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW TOSTOSTRONE IS EIGHT SIXTY BUT THEY YOU LOOK AT THEM ANYTHING I KIND OF CAOE TAE KIND OF DOUGHY LOOK TO THEM AND SO IT'S GOT TO BE THIS FREE TO STOSTRONE THHE ESTROGEN ET CETERA WELL THE O TRAININGLY TRAINING AND NEUTRITION  AV RIGT A MAN I I JUST THINK I THINK FOR ALL THIS TALK ABOUT TISTOSTRON WHICH I ENJOY TALKING ABOUT AND YOU KNOW I ENJOY TALKING ABOUT THE DATA ON YOU KNOW LONGTRM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF TESTOSTRON AS IS ANOTHER CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC I'M I ALSO THINK PEOPLE KIND OF OVERSTATE IT'S IMPORTANCE I AGREE I'M AND I THINK THEGOPER PEOPLE WHO THINK IF I COULD JUST FIX MY TESTOSTRON EVERYTHING WILL BE BETTER AND IT SORT OF LIKE NO ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL REALLY THE ONLY PURPOSE IN MY MIND O FIXING TESTOSTRON IS TO GIVE YOU THE CAPACITY TO WORK HARDER IT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP YOU RECOVER MORE FROM YOUR WORKOUTS THIS SHOULD JUST GIVE YOU A GREATER ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE MUSCLE PROTINE SYNTHESIS SO YOU KNW IF I JUST GIVE YOU A MUNCH OF TESTOSTRON AND YOU SIT ON THE COUCH AND YOUR NUTRITION DOESN'T CHANGE AND OU'RE NOT EXERCISING ANY MORE YOU'RE NOT GOININ EXPERIENCE ANY BENEFITS OF THIS THING I MEAN MY TESTOSTROM LEVELL HAS FLUCTUATED QUITE A BIT THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT AS AN ADULT NOT NOT SORT OF INCLUDING WHEN I WAS SORT OF A FANATICAL TEANAGOR BUT AS AN ADULT WHEN WAS I AT MY ABSOLUTE MOST INSANE PHYSIQUE LIKE MY BEST PERFORMANCE ON A DEXASCAM WOULD HAVE BEEN THIRTY AS THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OLD BY DEXA I WAS SEVEN PER CENT BODY FAT MY FAT FREE MASS AND DECXS WAS LIKE TWENTY THREE POINT THO TWENTYTHREE POINT THREE KILEGRAM'S PERMETER SQUARED I MEAN I WAS HUGE STRONG AND TOTALLY RIPPED MY TUST OSTRN WAS IN THE TOILET I WAS OVERTRAINING LIKE CRAZY I WAS YOU KNOW EXERCISING PROBBY TWENTY SIX HOURS A WEEK KILLING IT IN THE GIM SWIMMING LIKE A BANSHE CYCLING LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT GROSSLY OVERTRAINED LOW TEA BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN PHYSICALLY LOOKED LIKE TWICE THE GUY I AM TO DAY YOU NOW TODAY MY TEAS PROBLY TWICE AS HIGH AS IT WAS THEN SO YOU KNOW NOT YOU COULD SAY WHELL PETER WHAT IF YOU TOOK TEA BACK THEN HOW MUCH BETTER TO DO ABENT SURE I'M BUT BIGAN I THINK TO TAKE HOME IS JUST GIVING SOMEBODY TEA DOESN'T DO MUCH OF ANYTHING IT PROBABLY HELPS OME THE INSOLENT RESISTANCE FRONT WITHOUT ANY OTHER THING BUT TO ME THAT'S A WASTE LIKE THAT SQUANDERING THE GIFT THAT IT IS GIVING YOU WHICH IS THE ABILITY TO DO MORE WORK AND YOU KNOW CAPTURE THE BENEFIT OF IT VEA MUSCLE PROTINE SYNTHESIS I AGREE AND I THINK THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF TESTOSTRON WEATHER NOTS EXOGIN AS ARE INDOGINIS IS IT MAKES EFFORT FEEL GOOD YE AT SOME LEVEL IT REALLY SEEMS TO DO THAT AND SUPPULSKY TELLS ME THE MAIN REASON OR MECHANISTICALLY THE MAIN REASON THAT IT CAN DO THAT IS BY A JUSTING LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE IMIGNOLA IST AND SO THERE SOME INTERESTING IMIGING THERE I'D LOVE TO CHAP MORE ABOUT THE COLLESTERAL PATHWAY AND I KNOW THIS IS A HUGE LANDSCAPE AS WELL BUT I THINK WEERE GOVING A GOOD JOB OF DIVING IN DEEP BUT NOT GETTING STUCK IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENTS AT ALL THERE IS TREMENDOUS DEBATE ABOUT WHEATHER NOT DIETARY CLESTER ALL DIRECTLY RELATES TO YOU WOR DOS NOT RELATE TO ZERUM CLESTERALL ELDEL AN ECH DIEL HERE'S MY THITHER I THINK WELL LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARGUE I'M CERTAINLY I ARGUE U THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARGUE THAT IF ONE EATS A TON OF SATURATED FAT THAT ELDIEL GOES OUP IN  O DOWN CA BUT DOES NOT DITERRY CLESTERAL LEER SAID NO NOT DITURN CLESTROPER SAY BUT AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARGUE THAT AM YOU KNOW ANY INCREASE IN SATURATE FAT AND TAKE ITS GOING TO BE BAD THAT YOU ALREADY SINCIZE ENOUGH CLESTERALL FOR HOME ON PRODUCTION ET CETERA I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF HOW ONE SHOULD READ THEIR CHARTS AM MYELDIELAS IN WHAT I'M TOLD IS HEALTHY RANGE MY H YELLS AN ONE'S HEALTHY RANGE I DO TRYIN NOT OVER EAT THINGS LIKE BUTTER CHEESE AND RED MEAT BUT I DO EAT SOME OF THOSE THINGS AND I FEEL PRETTY GOOD BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE OPERATING UNDER THE A SUMPTION THAT EATING SATURATED FAT IS BAD AND YOU ONLY DO IT IN SO FAR AS YOU WANT TO TASTE IT AM AND THEN OF COURSE IS A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT A LOVE TO EAT ORGANS AND MEATS AND AND REALLY PACK COLESTER ALL AM AND WOULD ARGUE THAT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOUR ELDIELLAS AIGT SEVENTY AM IT IS NOT AN IMPACT YOUR HEALTH WHAT'S THE REALITY AROUND ELDIELL I AH DELL DIETERY CLESTERALL SATRATE FAT A AT LEAST IN YOUR VIEW A SO FIRST LET'S DIFFERIENDSHIP BTWEEN CLESTER AL AND FAT JUST FOR THE LISTENER I BECAUSE WE USE THEM THINGTHAT ON'T MAKE SURE PEOPLE SURSTAND SO SO CLES TER ALL IS A IS A REALLY COMPLICATED MOLECULES WHAT'S A RINGED MOLECULE A GOT I USED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT ITS STRUCTURE WAS BUT LIKE IT COULD HAVE THIRTY SIX CARBONS FOR ALL I REMEMBER A IT IS A LIPID SO IT IS A HYDROPHOBIC MLECULE BUT IS SYNTHASIZED BY EVERY CELL IN THE HUMAN BODY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WITHOUT IT IF YOU LOOK IT SORT OF GENETIC ACONDITIONS THAT IMPARICLESTERAL SYNTHESIS DEPENDING ON THEIR SEVERITY THEY CAN BE FATAL IN UTERO SO IN OTHER WORDS ANYTHING THAT REALLY INTERFERES WITH OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE CLESTERALL WILL IS A THREAT TO US IS A SPECIES AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS CLESTER ALL MAKES UP THE CELL MEMBRANE OF EVERY CELL IN OUR BODY SO YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW BUT MAYBE THE LISTENERS DON'T EVEN THOUGH A CELL IS A SPHERICAL THING IT HAS TO BE FLUID RIGHT ITS NOT JUST A RIGID LIKE SPHERE  LIKE A YOU'RE BLOW UP ALL RIGHT IT'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF MOVE IN THIS WAY TO MASH WITH OTHER CELLS IT ALSO HAS TO A COMMODATE HAVING POOREST STRUCTURES THAT TRAVERSE ITS MEMBRANE TO ALLOW IONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO GO ACROSS AND IT'S CLESTERALL THAT GIVES THE FLUIDITY TO THAT MEMBRANE IT'S ALSO IS YOUR ALLUDING TO THE BACKBONE OF SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HORMONS IN OUR BODY ESTROGEN PROJES TERON DUST ASTERON CORTUS ALL A SO WE HAVE THIS THING SUPERIMPORT OOK THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT DOES CLLESTRA CAN YOU GET COLLESTRAL IN YOUR DIET YES YOU CAN EAT FOODS THAT OUR RICH IN COLLESTRALL WHAT WAS KNOWN IN NINETEEN SIXTY BUT SOMEHOW ESCAPED EVERYBODY'S IMAGINATION UNTIL FINALLY THE AMERICAN HART ASSOCIATION ACKNOWLEDGE THIS A FEW YEARS AGO IS THAT THE COLLESTRAL YOU EAT DOES NOT REALLY MAKE IT INTO YOUR BODY AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT'S YSTERIFIED SO WE HAVE AND NOT TO GET TOO NURTY BUT I THINK PEOPLE THINK IF I REALLY THINK IT'SCIMPORTANT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THIS THING WORE SO WE HAVE CELLS IN OUR GUT ANDTO ENEROCITES THAT THEY'RE THE ENDITHELIAL CELLS OF OUR GUT THEY HAVE EACH ONE OF THEM HAS BASICALLY TWO TRANSPORTERS ON THEM SO THE FIRST IS CALLED THE NEMAN PICKS SE ONE LIKE ONE TRANSPORTER THE SECOND IS CALLED THE EIGH T P BINDING CASETTE G FIVE G EHT OK THE NEMON PICS ONE LIKE ONE TRANSPORTER WILL BRING IN ANY STERALL COLLESTERALL ZEO STERALL FITO STERALL ANY STERALL THAT FITS THROUGH THE DOOR WILL COME IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF THAT IS THE COLLESTERALL WE PRODUCE THAT GETS TAKEN BACK TO THE LIVER THAT THE LIVER PACKAGES AND BILE AND SECRETES SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT AIDS IN OUR DIGESTION WHICH IS ANOTHER THING I SHOULD IMENTIONED EARLYR IN ADDITION TO USIN CLLESTERALL FOR CELMEMBRANES AND HORMONS WE WOULDN'T BEABLE TO DIGEST OUR FOOD WITHOUT COLESTRALL BECAUSE IT'S WHAT MAKES UP THE BILE SALTS SO OUR OWN COLLESTRAL IS BASICALLY RECIRCULATED IN A POOL THROUGHOUT OUR BODY AND THIS IS THE WAY IT GETS BACK INTO THE BODY IT'S THROUGH THIS NEMON PICKSY ONE LIKE ONE TRANSPORTR WHEN IT GETS IN THERE THE BODY THIS IS THE CHECK POINT OF REGULATION THIS IS WHERE THE BODY SAYS DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH COLESTRAL IN THE BODY YES OR NO IF YES I WILL LET THAT COLESTERAL MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE CIRCULATION SO IT'LL GO OFF THE BASILATERAL SIDE OF THE CELL NOT THE LUMINAL SIDE INTO THE BODY ALTERNATIVELY THE BODY SAYS YOUKNOW WHAT WE HAVE ENOUGH COLESTERALL IMAN TO LET YOU POOP THIS OUT AND NOW THE EIGH T P BINDING CASETTE WILL SHOOT IT OUT IT'LL GO BACK INTO THE LUMINAL SIDE AND A WAY IT GOES THE SO ALL THE CLLESTERAL ON OUR BODY IS NOT A STERIFIED AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT BIG BULKY SIDE CHAIN ATTACHED TO IT THE CLLESTRAL YOU EAT IS ASTERIFIED AND IN ASTERIFIED COLLESTRA MOLECULE SIMPLY CAN'T PHYSICALLY PASS THROUGH THAT NEMON PICKSY ONE LIKE ONE TRANSPORTER NOW WE PROBABLY MANAGE TO D ESTERIFI TEN TO FIFTEEN PER CENT OF OUR DIETARY COLLESTRAL SO IN OTHERWORDS THERE ARE SMALL AMOUNTS OF DIETARY COLLESTERL THAT DO MAKE THEIR WAY INTO OUR CIRCULATION BUT IT REPRESENTS A SMALL FRACTION OF OUR TOTAL BODI'S POOL OF COLESTRAL AGAIN THIS WAS KNOWN EVEN BY ANSIL KEYS THA THE THE GUY WHO TURNED FAT INTO THE BIGGEST BOOGIMA T OF ALL TIME ANCIL KEYS ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES DIETARY CLLESTERAL PLAYS NO ROLE IN SYRUM COLLESTRAL AGAIN IT TOOK THE AMERICAN HART ASSOCIATION ANOTHER SIXTY YEARS TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT EVEN NOW THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DITARY CLLESTERAL HAS NOBERY SO WHY IS IT THAT IT'S PRETTY EASY TOFIND STUDIES ARE AT LEAST PEOPLEL WITHWHO ARE HIGHLY CRIDENTIALED FROM GOOD INSTITUTIONS CLAIMING THAT EATING SATURATED FAT TUNDER TAT'S DIFFERENT SATURATE FAT RED MEAT THINGS THAT ARE RICH IN COLLESTERAL ITO BE MORE SPECIFIC IS BAD FOR US IN TERMS OF SOR VESTUAL ELDEEL SO THIS IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS SO SATURATED FAT CON SUMPTION IN MANY PEOPLE WILL RAISE ELDEAL COLESTERAL SO I'S IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE WHAT WHAT IS SATURATED FATS A SATURATED FAT OF COURSE IS A FATIACID JUST SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND TOTALLY DIFFERENT MOLECULE FROM CLESTERAL CLESTERLS IS VERY COMPLICATED RING STRUCT MULTIPLE RING STUCK TOGETHER ESAFE SATURATED FAT IS JUST A LONG CHAIN FATIACID THAT IS FULLY SATURATED MEANINGAN HAS NO DOUBLE BONDS AND IT CAN EXIST IN ISOLATION IT CAN EXIST IN A TRIGLESTERIDE TRYICYL GLESTERIDE AROYUA PHOSPHOLIPPIT ARE LL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT SO WHEN WE EAT FOODS THAT CONTAIN FAT BASICALLY THERE ARE THREE DISTINCTIONS FOR THAT FAT IS IT SATURATED IS IT MONOON SATURATE ONE DOUBLE BONDER S AT POLLYON SATURATED TWO OR MORE DOUBLE BONDS THE OBSERVATION THAT EATING SATURATED FAT RAISES COLLESTERAL IS GENERALLY CORRECT A BUT AGAIN NOW IT MAKES BEECAUSE A PRENS OR TALKING ABOUT ELDEEL WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT ELDEEL IS THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S JUST SO GROSTLY MISUNDERSTOOD THAT IT'S A IT MAKES HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS VERY COMPLICATED A LET'S GO BACK TO THE COLLESTERAL PROBLEM IT'S O EVERY CELL IN OUR BODY MAKES COLLESTERAL AND ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION THEY MAKE ENOUGH THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF TIMES HOWEVER WHAN A CELL MEEDS TO BORROW COLLESTERAL FROM ANOTHER CELL OSO HOW WOULD YOU DO THIS RIGHTS IF YOUR IF YOUR SORT OF IF YOUR PLAYING GOD FOR A MINUTE AND YOU WANTED DESIGN AS SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRANSPORT CLLESTERAL FROM ONE CELL TO ANOTHER THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE YOU WOULD TRANSPORT THIS IS THROUGH THE CIRCULATION AND THE PROBLEM WITH CIRCULATION IS ITS WATER PLASMA IS WATER SO NOW YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHICH IS I WANT TO TRANSPORT CARGO THAT IS HYDROPHOBIC IN  HYDROPHILIC MEDIUM CAN'T DO IT SO YOU YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT WE TRANSPORT IN OUR BLOOD SODIUM ELECTROLITES IN A GLUCOS THINGS LIKE THAT THRE WATER SOLUBLE 'S EASY THEY JUST MOVE BACK AND FORTH IN OUR BLOOD WITH NO CHAPARONE BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO MOVE COLLESTERAL YOU HAVE TO PACKAGE IT IN SOMETHING THAT'S HYDROPHYLIC THAT SOMETHING IS CALLED ELYPROPROTI SO THEY HAVE THESE WE HAVE THESE SPHERICAL MOLECULES THAT ARE LIPID ON THE INSIDE PROTINE ON THE OUTSIDE LIPO PROTINE AND INSIDE THEY CONTAIN CLESTERAL AND TRIGLESTERIDES TO NOGT YOUVE GET THE SPHERICAL THING TRIGLESTERIDE CLESTRAL ON THE INSIDE AND IT'S CHAPERONE BY A HYDROPHILIC MOLECULE THAT ALLOWS IT TO MOVE THROUGH OUR CIRCULATION AND THOSE LIPE APPROTINES EXIST IN DIFFERENT DENSITIES SO IF YOU RUN THESE OUT ON A JEL LECTRIPHRESIS PLATE YOU'L YOU'LL IDENTIFY DIFFERENT DENSITIES THE DENSITY IS A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH PROTINE AND HOW MUCH LIPIT IS IN IT SO THE HIGHEST DENSITY OF THIS IS CALLED A HIGH DENSITY LIPE APROTINE AND THE LOWEST DENSITY OF THIS IS CALLED A VERY LOW DENSITY LIPE APPROTINE A V L D L AND THEN NEXT TO THAT YOU HAVE AN L D L A LOW DENSITY LIPE APPROTINE AND THE NEXT TO THAT YOU HAVE AN ID L AN INTERMEDIATE DENSITY LIPE APROTINE SO A YOU KNOW NECIGOS B L D L IDL L DEAL BUT SO AM WHEN PEOPLE SAY MY L D L IS I OR MY L D L IS ONE HUNDRED WHAT ARE THEY SAYING THERE'E SAYING THE COLESTERAL CONCENTRATION OF MY L D L PARTICLES IS A HUNDRED MELEGRAMS PERDESOLETOR SO THE TOTAL CLESTERAL CONCENTRATION YOU HAVE IN YOUR CIRCULATION IS THAT NUMBER THAT SAYS TOTAL CLESTRAL SO SOME ONE'S BLOOD PANNEL SAYS MY TOTAL CLESTRALS TWO HUNDRED IT MEANS THAT IF YOU TAKE ALL THE LIPE APPROATHINGS IN THEIR CIRCULATION BUS THEM OPEN AND MEASURE THE CLESTERAL CONTENT IT'S TWO HUNDRED MELEGRAMS PRODESOLETOR AND FOR ALL INTENSIN PURPOSES BECAUSE THE IDLS OR SO SHORT LIVE THAT'S BASICALLY THE SUM OF YOUR EL DEAL CLESTERAL YOUR V L D L CLESTERAL IN YOUR HTAL CLESTERAL THOSE THREE THINGS SUM TO YOUR TOTAL CLESTERAL WHAT ABOUT L D L LITTLE A THAT YOU MENTION YOU EL PI LITTLE ES L OTHERSA A HE'S ANOTHER ACTOR HE IS A SPECIAL TYPE OF L D L THAT AGAIN IN SORT OF TEN TO TWENTY PER SUNDER THE POPULATION IS A REALLY BAD ACTOR SO THAT'S IN L D L THAT HAS ANOTHER APO LIPE APPROTINE ON IT CALLED APO LIPE APPROTINE LITTLE E UM THE OTHER THING I'LL JUST SAY ON THIS BECAUSE EARLIER I MENTIONED APO B THERE ARE TWO BROAD FAMILIES OF LIPE APROTINES THERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE WRAPPED IN APO BS AND THOSE THAT ARE RAPPED IN APO AS THE APO A FAMILY IS THE H D L FAMILY THE APO B FAMILY IS THE V L D L I D L L D L FAMILY SO FOR SOMEBODY WHO LETS AY THEIR TOTAL CLESTERAL IS AS TO STAY WITH TWO HUNDRED YE SIMPLICITY  WHAT YE LIKE TO SEE IN TERMS OF THE  L L D L RATIO COULDN'T CARE LESS I ONLY CARE ABOUT APO B I ONLY CARE ABOUT APOB I CARE ABOUT THE COSITIVE AGENT OF ATHERUS COROSIS APO B IS THE THING THAT DRIVES ATHERUS COROSIS AND WHAT LEVELS ARE ATTRACTIVE OR REPULSIVE FOR YOU WHEN YOU SEE L LEVELS OF APO B THAT ARE BLANK YOU GET REALLY CONCERN UM WHAT AEPENDS ON THE PERSONS OBJECTIVES SO AGAIN WE TAK K A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW MAN WE HAVE VITALITY NOW LIVED AND I WANT TO LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED YES O YOU SOMING SOME TAPE A YOU TELL ME YOU WANT TO LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED YEUR AN ANED TO KEEP YOUR APO B BELOW THIRTY MELIGRAMS PERDESOLETER BUT TAY I WANT TO LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED BUT I ALS WELL HOW ABOUT I I DON'T CARE HOW LONG I LIVE BUT I WANT TO FEEL GREAT WHILE I LIVE AGAIN IT DEPENDS RIGHT LIKE ANYBODY WHO'S HOW TO HEARD ATTACK IS GOING TO BE COMPROMISED IN THEIR ABILITY TO FEEL WELL AFTER RIGHT SO I GUESS THAT I WHAT I MAKE SAY THAT WAY BECAUSE IF YOU 'RE GONG TO TELL ME THAT I'M IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT LIVE TO A HUNDRED LEVEL I'M GOING TO HAVE TO A GIVE UP MY PERSONAL LIFE IN MY A NON I MIGHT MY GETTING FUNCTIONING THAN THAT I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED SURE BUT BUT  O GET EL D AL LEVELS AND REALLY AGAIN PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS EL DAL IT'S REALLY APO B RIHT APO B IS THE TOTAL CONCENTRATION OF EL D L AN V L DL AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS THOSE ARE THE BIG ATHROGENIC PARTICLES EL DL ALSO INCLUDES O THE THE ELPY LITTLE A ATHOUGH THE CONCENTRATION OF OPULITLA IS RELATIVELY SPEAKING SO SMALL THAT IT DOESN'T GENERALLY SHOW UP AS MUCH IN THE APO B SO WE TREAT APO B AND BASICALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS YOU WANT APO B TO BE AS CLOSE TO THE LEVEL AS IT WAS WHEN YOU WERE BORN SO WE START DEVELOPING HART DISEASE WHEN WERE BORN THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS I'M THE AUTOPSY STUDIES MAKE THIS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WHEN YOU LOOK AT ATOPSIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIS WAS FIRST DONE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT WAS AGAIN REPEATED AGAINST ALWAYS DONE AFTER WE HAVE A WAR RIGHT SO IN THA NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT WAS DONE ON PEOPLE OU WHO DIED IN V ATNOM AND THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS IT WAS DONE ON MOSTLY YOUNG MEN BUT SOME YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE EAUTA DYING IN IN AROKAN AGANISTAN AND WE SAW WITHOUT ANY AMBIGUITY THAT CARTIAVASKER DISEASE IS ALREADY TAKING HOLD IN PEOPLE WHO WARE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY YEARS OLD AND TO BE CLEAR THEY AEN'TGOIN TO DIE OF ATHROS COROSIS AT THAT AGE THERE' STILL FORTY FIFTY YEARS AWAY FROM IT BUT THIS IS A LIFE LONG DISEAS AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DISEASE CAN'T REALLY DEVELOP UNTIL APO B REACHES A CERTAIN THRESHOLD AND THAT'S THE THRESHOLD THAT MOST OF US GET TO BY THE TIME WERE IN A SORT OF IN OURTEENS SO IT'S THIS REALLY YOUNG APO B LEVEL OF CON A TWENTY TO THIRTY MELIGRAMS PERDESOLETER THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ATHROS COROSIS SO APO B IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO DEVELOP A  C V B NOW THAT O OMTIVE YOU CAN TO ASK WHATEER SOME OF THE TOP BEHAVIOUR OL NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION IF ANY BASED AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG BASE WAYS TO TARGET APO B WELL NUTRITIONALLY YOU BASICALLY HAVE TWO BIG TOOLS RIGHT AND IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S DRIVING UP APO B SO APO B REMEMBER IS THE CONCENTRATION OF EL D LAN V L D L PARTICLES AND WHAT DO THEY CARRY CLESTRAL AND TRY GLECERIDES SO ANYTHING THAT REDUCES CLESTRAL AND REDUCES TRIGLICERIDES IS GOING TO REDU SAPO B TRIGLESTERIDES ARE GENERALLY DRIVEN BY CARBAHYDRATE AND TAKE SO MORE INSOLENT RESISTANCE MORE CARBAHYDRATE AND TAKE MORE TRIGLESERIDES SO WE GOING CLINICALLY THIS IS READILY APPARENT TO ANYONE WHO TREATS PATIONTS IF YOU RESTRICT CARBAHYDRATES YOU WILL REDUCE TRIGLESERIDES THAT THAT JUST HAPPENS ALL DAY LONG BUT IF YOU REDUCE TRIGLUSTERIDES BY RAISING FAT IN TAKE SO MUCH IT CAN STILL RAISE APO B SO SO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT IT SO SO IN AN IDEAL WORLD IT'S CAN YOU LOWER SATURATED FAT WHICH TENDS TO BE THE ONE THAT IS MOST DRIVING APO B WHILE LOWERING CARBAHYDBRATE AND THEN SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET BUT HERE'S THE REALITY OF IT IS THERE'S NOBODY WITH DIETARY INTERVENTION THAT'S GOING TO GET TO A LEVEL OF THIRTY MELOGRAMS PERDESOLATOR I'VE NEVER SEEN IT HURE TATERY IN CONMENTION GAT SO WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS GON TO BE MARNICALOGIC AT THIS POINT STATEN TYPE IN DRONA YOU HAVE MULTICAL CLASSES OF DRUGSSO THEM TRIED AN TRUE IS THE STATIN SO STATENS WORK BY INHIBITING CLESTERAL SYNTHESIS AND THE NET EFFECT OF THAT IS THAT THE SO THE LIVER IS REALLY SENSITIVE TO CLESTERAL LEVELS IT DOESN'T WANT TOO MUCH IT DOESN'T WANT TOO LITTLE WHEN YOU INHIBIT CLESTERAL SYNTHESIS THE LIVER SAYS I WANT MORE CLESTERAL SO IT PUTS MORE ELDEEL RECEPTORS ON ITS SURFACE AND IT PULLS THE ELBEEL OUT OF CIRCULATION THAT'S WHAT LOWERS THE EL BEEL IN THE CIRCULATION AM SO DON'T GAN NINE STATENS IN USE TODAY WE TYPICALLY USE FOUR OF THEM A THE SIDE OFFACT PROFIL CONTRARY TO CAN OF ALL THE SORT OF STATIN HATING PROPAGANTA OUT THERE VERY BENIGN RIT FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE MUSCLE SORENESS WHICH REVERSES UPON CESSATION AM YOU DON'TCOGMAL THE FACTS AGAIN I THINK IT'S IN TERMS OF ACTUAL COMPARING IT AN APLICE BOT NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER IT RIGHT SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU PUT A PATIENT ON IT THEY WON'T COMPLAIN OF SOMETHING NO BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CLENICAL TRIALS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT STATENS IN PARCOGNITION THE'S ALSO NO EVIDENCE IN CLENICAL TRIALS THAT THEY ACCELERATE THE RISK OF NARIG ENERBUSIES IN FACT IT'S THE OPPOSITE NOW WE WILL THERS IS THERE'S A VERY NEW ANT'S CASE WE MAKE ANDREW WHICH IS WILL LOOK AT PATIENCE WE HIGHLY SUPPRESSD DOES MOSTRAL LEVELS WE WILL BACK OFF WE WE DO WANT A MAINTAIN DAES MOSTRL ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL A BECAUSE OF SOME EVIDENCE THAT IS STILL I THINK VERY PRELIMINARY BUT ENOUGH FOR US THAT WE SAY WHY TAKE THE CHANCE WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER POOLS TO LOWER CLESTERAL WHY WOULD WE OVERSUPPRESS SYNTHESIS IN A SUSCEPTIBLE INDIVIDUAL A SO THE NEXT TOOL YOU LOOK AT IS A DRUG THAT BLOCKS THE ABSORPTION OR THE REABSORPTION OF CLESTRAL THAT MEMER THAT NEMAN PICSE ONE LIKE ONE TRANSPORTER SO THAT GUY HAS A A DRUG CALLED AZETAMIDE THAT JUST MECHANICALLY BLOCKS IT SO IN PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY I MENTION EARLIER WE MEN WE MEASURE ALL THOSE STER ALLS AND PEOPLE SO WE ALSO MEASURE THINGS CALLED PHIT A STERALS AND THE FIDAL STERALS GIVE US AN INDICATION OF HOW ACTIVE THAT TR S PORTER IS SO THE HIGHER YOUR FIGHT USDERRILS THE MORE LIKELY Y WARE TO RESPOND TO ZETIMA NEXT CLASS OF DRUGS IS A DRUG THAT BLOCKS CLESTRALL SYNTHESIS BUT ONLY IN THE LIVER SO THE STATIN DOES IT GLOBILY A THE THIS OTHER DRUG CALLED BEMBIDOIC ACID DOES IT ONLY IN THE LIVER SO HAS A VERY SIMILAR MECHANISM TO STATINS DIFFERENT ENZIME A NOT QUITE AS POTENT BUT WAF YOU WERE SIDE EFFECT SO ANY PATIONETS HAVING A RESPONSE TO STATENS IT'S ADVERSE WILL TRY THIS OTHER THING WHAT'S TA CALLED ONE WULTI BEMPIDOIC ASAND DNOICASI THE MOST POTENT DRUG OF THE LOT IS THE PIC SCANINE IN HIBITOR SO PIC SCNINE SE PROTINE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE LATE NINETIES I BELIEE A IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEGRADATION OF ELDIAL RECEPTORS THIS WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN PEOPLE WHO HAD A CONDITION CALLED FAMILIAL HYPEROCLESTROLEMIA OR F H TO THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE INCREDIBLY HIGH CLESTRALL TYPICALLY THEIR CLUS TOTAL CLUSTRAL LEVEL IS THREE HUNDRED THEIR ELDIAL CLESTRALL IS TYPICALLY IN A NORTH OF TWO HUNDRED MELIGRAMS PERDESOLATOR THIS IS A DISEASE THAT IS DEFINED BY THE PENA TYPE NOT THE GENA TYPE SO THE PENA TYPE HAS A VERY CLEAR DEFINITION WHICH I BASICALLY JUST GAVE YOU THE GENA TYPE IS THERE'S A MILLION PATHS TO GET THERE THERE'S OVER THREE THOUSAND MUTATIONS THAT ARE KNOWN TO PRODUCE THAT PENA TYPE THIS WAS DISCOVERED TO BE ONE OF THEM IN PEOPLE WHO HAD HYPERFUNCTIONING PIECI IA A PIC ES C PC SCNINE THIS PROTINE WAS JUST CONSTANTLY HAMMERING AND DESTROYING THE ALDEAL RECEPTORS AND SO THEIR ELDIAL WOULD BE HUGE AND MY EXTENSIONTHER TOTAL CLESTROWOUL BE SO  NINETEEN US AR IN TWO THOUSAND SIX HELLAN HOBS AND COLLEAGUES DISCOVERED AN OPPOSITE GROUP OF POPULATION PEOPLE WHO HAD ELDIAL CLESTRAL NATURALLY OF TEN TO TWENTY MELIGRAMS PERERDESOLETER WHICH WOULDBE AN APO B OF ABOUT TWENTY MILLGRAMS R DESOLETER A AND WHO NEVER GOT HEART TO SEES THE REMUNE TO HARTDISES NO MATTER HOW LONG THEY LIVE AND THEY HAD THE OPPOSITE THEY HAD HYPO FUNCTIONING PIC SCNINE AND SO THAT WAS TWO TOUTOF SIX HIN WENGLEN GERNAL MEDICINE THAT BASICALLY GOT A WHOLEBUNCH OF DRUG COMPANIES HOT ON THE TRAIL OF PRODUCING A DRUG TO MIMIC IT SO NOW WE HAVE THESE ANTIBODIES AND THEIR WILDLY EFFECTIVE WHANT PERCENTAGE YO OF EURPATIENTE OVER FORTY FAVE A DOU HAVE ON EITHER STATIN OR ON ONE OF EACE OTHER LOTEN IS IS COMBINATIONS AND I WOULD SAY EIGHTY PER CENT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT OUR OBJECTIVE IS LIKE WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE LIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SORT OF WORLD VIEW OF THIS RIGHT IF YOU LIKE WHAT'S THE MOST PREVALENT CAUSE OF DEATH GLOBALY SAINT CARDIANAS YAS AND AN  LIKE HOW CLOSE IS IT SO THE THE LAST YEUAR BEFORE COVID COVICONA MECIS UP THESE NUMBERS LIBIT BUT IF YOU GO ON TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE DIED OF HEART DISEASE NUMBER TWO CANCER TEN MILLION LIKE NOTHING'S IN THE ZIPICODE OF ATHROSCOROSIS AND IF YOU REMEMBER WHAT I JUST SAID IF YOU IF YOU HAD IF YOU TOOK EV ERYBODY IN THEIR TWENTIES AND REDUCED THEM TO A LEVEL OF THAT OF A CHILD YOUD MAKE A C V D AN ORPHAN DISEASE SO THE CRES WHY DON' T WE YUN THER WHY DON'T WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS I REALIZE THERE'S SOME NUONCIS IT'S IT'S NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD IS NOT AS SIMPLE AST SAYING EAT LESS CHEESE RED MEAT AND AND WATCHER ELD YELL YET ON A STATIN BUT WHY DO WE HEAR SO LITTLE ABOUT APO B IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION LOT I SO CHA ME IS SUCH A ASCU LANDSCRE AS WE KNOW UM PEOPLE SHOUTING INTO TUNNELS OF A A VERY A CLARITY YOU KNOW SOME AR BEAUTIFUL BRONZE TUNNELS WITH CLEAN WALLS AND OTHERS ARE SUER LINES AUM AND THEY ALL CONVERGE IN THE SAME PLACE I AS WE KNOW UM BUT WHY DONT WE HEAR SO TLELITTLE ABOUT THIS I MEAN I'M NOT ONESTATIN A BUT NOW BEGINNING TO THINK THAT MAYBE THAT MY BE A GOOD IDEA TO CONSIDER ONE OF THESE OTHER COMPOUNDS I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME I LOOKD AT MY APOB SPECIFICALLY I'M GESSING MY PHYSICIAN DID BUT U WHY DON'T WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS THIS IS SOUND SO IMPORTANT SOMETHING THE MOST IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AS ALL THE HORMON STUFF IN ALL THE STUFF ABOUT UM SMOKING AND HEAD INJURIES AND IGHTY H T AND ALL THE REST I MEAN AS IS IRRELEVANT IF YOU'RE DEBT YE UM IT'S A GRY QRESSION I DON'T THINK I HAVE A GREAT INSIGDT AS TO WHY THIS ISN'T MORE FRONT IN CENTER IM I THINK THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS WHY DON'T WE EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW TO THINK ABOUT IT I MEAN ATHAT THE THE INDERS AWHOLE CHAPTER IN MY BOOK I'M WORKING ON THAT REALLY GETS TO THIS PROBLEM AF WHY WHY AREN'T WE LOOKING AT ATHROSCROSIS IN TERMS OF TREATING THE COSITIVE AGENT INSTEAD WE LOOK AT A MODIFYING TEN YEAR RISK SO THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I CALL MEDICINE TWOPOINO AN MEDICINE THREE POINO THAT'S TN TWOPONOW WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE GENERALLY PRACTICING TO DAY WHEN IT COMES TO A C B D SAYS LOOK WE WILL TREAT YOU WE WILL LOWER THAT ELDIAL CLUSTRAL THEY STILL DON'T TALK ABOUT APO B BUT THAT'S A VERY AMERICAN THING IF YOU GO OUTSIDE OFTHE UNITED STATES EVERYBODY'S TALKINGABOUT APO B IT'S IN THE GUIDE LINES IN EUROPE IN CANID EVERYWHERE ELSE THE UNITEDSTATES IS VERY STUBBORN ON THIS AND IT'S DUE TO A COUPLE OF REALLY WEIRD PERSONALITIES IN THE LIPID WORLD UM BUT UM BUT THE THE THE PARADIME IS WHEN YOU'RE TEN YEAR RISK REACHES FIVE PER CENT WHEN THERE'S A FIVE PER CENT CHANCE THATYOURE GOIN TO HAVE A HART ATTACKED STROKE OR DIE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS NOW IT'S TIME TO TREAT YOU A MEDICINE THREE POINTOS SAYS THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT YOU TREAT THE COSITIVE AGENT IF THERE'S A POSITIVE AGENT YOU TREAT IT IF BLOOD PRESSURE RAISES THE RIS OF HART DISEASE YOU LOWER BROOD BLOOD PRESSURE IF SMOKING RAISES THE RISK OF SOMETHING YOU TREAT SMOKING UM AND THE REASON THAT THE RISK MODEL IS SO BAD WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT TEN YEAR RISK IS AGEIS THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF RISK AM AR NOT RIGHT TO IF YOU TAKE A SEVENTY YEAR OLD WITH PERFECT LIPIDS AND PERFECT BLOOD PRESSURE AND PERFECT EVERYTHING THE'RE TEN YEAR RISK OF A  C V D IS PROBABLY FOUR TO FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE MOST UNHEALTHY THIRTY ER ROM IT'S NOT EVEN CLOTHES IT IS A LO LIKE E DISEASE YOU KNOW YOU THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE WE ALWAYS SAY THAT THE BIGGEST RESFACTOR FOR GOING BLIND FROM GLACOMA IS BEING AN OLDER PERSON FRANKLY YOU KNOW ISIR IF YOU COULD IDENTIFY WHAT THE RISK FACTORS ARE FOR GLACOMA IMAGIN IF THE PARADIME WAS WE'RE ONLY GOING TO TREAT IT WHEN YOU'RE RISK OF BLINDNESS REACHES FIVE PER CENT WHICH ISN'T TRIGGERD UNTIL YOUR OLD ENOUGH ANYWAY WOULDN'T YOU RATHER KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE THIRTY AND SAY WAI IF MAYBE BEING IN THE SUN WITHOUT SUN GLASS IS OR YOU KNOW USING THIS TYPE OF IE DROP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS A NEGATIVE IMPACT I'D RATHER KNW THAT SOONER SO THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE WITH RESPECT TO PREVENTION AND I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN ONE ELEMENT OF PREVENTION I MAKE NO CONSIDERATION I AM ONLY COMING AT THIS THROUGH THE LENDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL I AM NEVER COMING AT THIS THROUG THE ENDS OF SOCIETY THAT MAKES MY LIFE EASIER AN IT MAKES THE PROBLEM I'M SOLVING EASIER I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUALITY ADJUSTED LIFE YOUR PROBLEM I DON'T HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION IS IT ECONOMICAL TO TREAT PEOPLE AT THIRTY I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT I I ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN YOURE TURNISOLVE REALLY COMPLICATED PROBLEMS HAM MORE YOU CAN SIMPLIFY THE BETTER SO I'VE JUST ACKNOWLEDGED OPENLY NOT SOLVING THAT IF YOU WANET TO CRITICIZE ME FOR IT THAT'S FINE LET'S BE TRANSPARENT BUT ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THE PERSON I'M SITTING ACROSS FROM AND IN THAT SITUATION IT'S REALLY THEIR DECISION IF THEY CAN JUSTIFY THE COST OF TREATMENT AN ESOTERIC QUESTION AND THEN A LESES ATERET QUESTION THE ESOTERIC QUESTION RELATES TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE ITNICHE BUT NOT NECESSARILY SO WHICH IS AM PEPTIDES AND STEMSELVES IN PERR P I DON'T WANT TO GO OFF ON TOO MUCH OF ATTENTION ON RE HAVE BUT I KNOW YOU'VE DONE HA NUMBER OF POSTS ON SOCIOMENIA RECENTLY THAT WER I HAVE TO SELL YOU REALLY THOUGHTFUL AND I REALLYAPPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE ILLING TO SHARE YOUR OWN I'M TISSUE REABILITATION EXPERIENCE AND POINT PEOPLE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A LANDSCAPE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE IT AND A YOU TUAL FRIEND OF OURS NOT TO BE NAMED SEND ME A TAX IN SAID IMEN WBE TALKIN TO A T A AND WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT STUDIES ON THINGS LIKE B PIEC ONE FIVE SEVEN IS GASTRIC PAPTIDE THAT ANECDOTALLY AGAIN ANECDOTALLY PEOPLE REPORT GETTING INJECTIONS OF THIS AND THE SHOULDER ME AT CETERA AND FEELING SO MUCH BETTER SO MUCH FASTER BUT THEYRE REALLY AREN GOOD STUDIES CONTROLED STUDIES AND YOU HEAR ALL THE SAME SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT PLATEL RICH PLASMA P R P WHICH I SOME ONE TELLS YOU THEYR A LOT OF STEMSELVES IN THEM THEY'RE LYING THEY'RE NOT ALOS THEMSELVES IN THEM AND YOU HEAR ALSO YOURE ABOUT STEMSELVES WHICH ARE NOT F TA APPROVED IT LEASE IN THIS YOU KNOW FOR MOST USES IN THIS COUNTRY BUT ARE CERTAINLY PEOPLE ARE FLYING DOWN TO COLUMBIA AND GETTING INJECTIONS AND WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OR EXPERIENCE WITH THINGS LIKE B PC ONE BY SEVEN SPECIFICALLY CAUSE PAPTIZE IS A HUGE LANDSCAPE WI PRIED YOUA HOLE EMICON THEM IT'S AM THINGS LIKE P R P A PRPS NOW APPROVED FOR AWOMEN ARE GINJECTIONS OF THIS INTO THEIR OVERIES TO IMPROVE A VOLICAL ACCOUNT WE KNOW THIS I PEOPLE GAING INJECTIONS A PARP IN EVERY TISSUE AN ORGAN IN IT HOL MEN ARE GTTING INJECTING THEIR PENIS SO I HEAR AM FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS THAT ARE UNCLEAR TO ME AM WHAT'S THE DEAL AT PR P B P C ONE FIVE SEVEN AND STEMICELVES DO YOU EVER S INTERESTING EFFACTS ARE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT THESE AM COMPOUNDS DO YOU PRESCRIBE OR DIRECT PEOPLE TOWARDS THESE THE FTA APPROVED ONES YES SO SHORT ANSWERS I'M DEFINITELY CURIOUS ABOUT THEM AND I'D LOVE TO SEE THE WORK DONE BUT I ALSO THINK THIS IS ABOUT AS WILD WILD WEST AS IT GETS APPR P LESS SO A BUT CERTAINLY STEMSELVES AND PEPTIDES AND YOU KNOW I JUST THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITHOUT A CLENICAL TRIAL YOU GOT A SHOP WITH A LOT MORE DATA RIGHT SO LUS YUSE RAP A MISON AS AN EXAMPLE RIGHT I'M A HUGE PROPOUND ING A RAP A MISEON AND YOU CAN SAY WHAT PETER HOW CAN YOU TAKE OR PRESCRIBE RAP A MIS AND FOR GUREAU PROTECTIVE EFFECTS WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE A HUMAN CLENICAL TRIAL DEMONSTRATING THAT AT LENGTHENS LIFE AND THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE I HAVE EIGHTY FOR OTHER PIECES OF DATA THAT ALL POINT IN THE SAME DIRECTION ACROSS EVERY MODEL ORGANISM GOING BACK MORE THAN A BILLION EARS AND THAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FROM JOY SAMMY AND SALLY DID THIS THING AND I THINK IT WORKS ANDTHAT YOU JOULD THEY JUST CAN'T BE COMPARED NOW I HAVE NO IDEA IF STEMSELLES WORK I HAVE NO IDEA IF P P C ONE FIVE SEVEN WORKS IAVE NO IDEA FRANKLY OF P R P EVEN WORKS THOUGH IT MIGHT SEEM TO HAVE SOME EFFICACY IN SOME INDICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE WHEN IT COMES TO EARLY HAIR LOST MAYBE WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW CERTAIN JOINT IM ISSUES IM BUT THE REAL OF IT IS LIKE I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING WE DO HAS AN OPPORTUNITY COST AND THAT OPPORTUNITY COST IS SOMETIMES FINANCIAL BUT I OCTUALLY FIND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S IN TIME AND EFFORT AND ENERGY THAT GOES INTO SOMETHING NOW WHEN I WAS YOU KNOW WAITING TO GET MY SHOULDER SURGERY THIS IS AN INJURY THAT I'VE HAD FOR EVER RIGHT ISNAT INJURY YOU KNOW I I I THIS THIS INJURY WAS ACTUALLY PROBABLY THE GREATEST SOURCE OF DISCOMFORT I HAD SWIMMING E CATTLING A CHANNEL THE LAST TIME INTWO THOUSAND NINE SO THAT'S TELLS YOU HOW LONG I'VE HAVE THIS INJURY IM BUT YOU KNOW I SORT OF KNEW AT SOME POINT LIKE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE IT FIXED AND I SORT OF WENT DOWN THIS RABIT HOLE LIKE HAY IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO AVOID HAVING SURGERY YOU KNOW I WOULD INFUSING A MILLION STEMSELLS INTO IT WORK AM AND IN SPEAKING WITH IS MANY WORE THA PETIC SURGEONS AS I COULD THE ANSWER WAS OUNT OF UNAMBIGUOUSLY KNOW AND BY THE WAY DOESN'T MEAN YOU WOULDN'T FEEL BETTER IF I INJECTED A BUNCH OF STEMSELLS INTO YOUR SHOULDER THERE LOT OF REASONS THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER JUST LIKE THE REBUNCH OF REASONS YOU CAN FEEL BETTER IF SOMEBODY IN JEC SAILING DIRECTLY INTO YOUR JOINT SO SO THAT THE QUESTIONS IS AT GOING TO FIX THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM IN IF SO WILL IT DO SO BY WHAT MECHANISM SO I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IF YOU TOOK A THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH MY PARTICULAR INJURY AND INJECTED THEM WITH STEMSELVES IT WOULDN'T DO A THING BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF MY INJURY AT A COMPLETELABORAL TARE UM ARE THERE SOME INJURIES THAT MIGHT BENEFIT FROM IT ETPOSSIBLE SO THE QUESTION IS HOW WOULD YOU DESIGN THE TRIAL TO NARROW DOWN YOUR PATIENT POPULATION CORRECTLY SO THAT YOU MIGHT SEE A SIGNAL CAUSE THE OTHER RISK OF DOING A TRIAL IS YOU HAVE TOO MUCH OF A HETEROGENIOUS PATIENT POPULATION IT'S YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK YOUR REALLY DOING AND YOU GET MEANINGLESS RESULTS YOU GET A NULL RESULT WHEN IN FACT THERE'S A SMALL SIGNAL BUT YOU WERE UNDER POWERED TO PICK IT UP BECAUSE YOU KOW YOU ONLY HAD TEN PERCENT YOUR PATIENT POPULATION THAT WAS THE RIGHT PATIENT POPULATION TO GET THAT SO OU KOW WILL WE EVER GET THERE I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I DON'T SEE WHAT THE INCENTIVE IS RIGHT YOU'VE PEOPLE WHO WERE MAKING MONEY HAND OVER FIST DOING PROCEDURES ON THE BASIS OF I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT WOULD THEIR MOTIVATION ARE INCENTIVE BE TO O SORT OF SEE THIS LEGITIMIZE YOU'D REALLY HAVE TO E ABLE TO SAY WHETHER THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE SORT OF A FARMA ANGLE TO THIS UM IT SORT OF ONE OF THE WISHES I HAD RIGHT LIKE IF I WAS IF I WAS A A BILLIONAIRE I FEEL LIKE THE WAY I WOULD PROBABLY WASTE ALL OF MY MONEY WOULD BE RUNNING CLENICAL TRIALS ON STUFF NOBODY CARED ABOUT NOW IT MIGHT JUST LIKEWISE I HA SHOWING YOU BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE YESTERDAY ECORDED AS SIT DOWN WITH SOMEBODY FROM CALTEK WHO WORKS ON A GRESSION AN RAGE IN THINK AND OTHER THINGS LAY TO THAT AND AS IDENTIFIED PEPTIDES THAT OR APPROVED YEF THE A FOR OTHER REASONS THAT SEEM TO ADJUST ANXIETY MIGHT EVEN IN JUSTIGGRESSION AND PATHOLOGIC AGGRESSION AND WENT OFF ONTO A LONG DESCRIPTION OF WHY NONE OF THESE DRUGS EXIST ON THE MARKET FOR THE TREATMEN OF PSYCHIATRICALNESS AND YET PROBABLY WOULD WORK UM AND WHAT'S MISSING IS A BILLIONAIRO OR A BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY THAT IS WILLING TO INVEST IN SOMETHING THAT VERY LIKELY WILL WORK BUT THE MARKET VALUE ISN'T QUITE THERE OR IT FAILED IN A PREVIOUS TRIAL AND SO NO ONE WANTS TO TOUCHYO WITH HT ENFOOTPOLE IM OF WLE SOME ONE LES ING THIS WILL BEIN SENTIVIZED TO PROVIDE THIS SORT OF AVENU FOR THAT A THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I HAVE TO ASK BUT ABOU ONE O MAKE ONE OTHER POINT UNDER WHICH IS TO ME THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THESE THINGS IS IT GETS IT IT'S A CRUTCH YOU KNOW IT SOR LAT WOULD BE TALKED ABOUT WITH LIKE HAY JUST FIX MY TEA MAN AND EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE AND IT'S LIKE NOW THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW WHAT I WORRY ABOUT WHEN I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLAMOURING FOR THIS STAFF IS A LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT WHETHER IT' PSYCHOLOGICALLY OR OTHERWISE THE SORT OF SAY WHILE NOW THAT I'VE HAD THIS THING DONE I DON'T HAVE TO DO THE HARD WORK OF THE REAL REHAPPEN MING IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING THROUGH MY SHOULDER SURGERY AND I'M NOW THREE AND A HALF MONTHS OUT HOW'S IT FEEL AMAZE HIM MEAN'T LOOK I STILL CAN'T DO A LOT OF E IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW A WHILE I HAVE NYVON BEENABLE TO SHOOT A BAU YET AND IT'LL PROBABLY BE A YEAR BEFORE I'LL GO BACK TO YOU KNOW LONG DEAD HANGS AND HEAVY DEAD LIPS MAN IT I DON'T MA BE NINE MONTHS BUT IT'S EN I'M NOT THERE YET BUT WHAT I LEARNED THROUGH A REALLY AMAZING PRE HAVE AND RE HAV PROCESS IS WYKE YOU JUST GOT A DO THE WORK AND IT'S FREEK AND HARD SHOULDERS ARE THE MOST TEDIOUS BORING THING IN THE WORLD I MEAN THREE DAYS A WEEK I AM DOING FOR FOUR DAYS A WEEK I AM DOING ONE HOUR OF JUST DETICATED STUFF FOR THIS SHOULDER THAT IS SUPERDISSUPERUNCOMFORTABLE SUPERBORING SUPERFRUSTRATING AM BUT I I MEAN I HAVE FAITH IN THE METHODOLOGY RIGHT AND AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING JUST SHOOT THE STEMSELVES INTO ME AND IDO'T HAVE TO DO ANY THAT STUFF AND THE RE OUT OF IT IS I I THINK THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE HAVE TYOU EVER TRIED TO BE PECY WHEN FRUNCE TEM A YA WE TRIED IT A WE HAD YOU KNW AGAIN MAY BE SEVEN Y YEARS AGO WE HAD A BUNCH OF PATIENTS ASK ABOUT IT SO YOU KNOW MY VIEW IS OA I WAS PRETTY CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS NO SAFETY DOWNSIDE TO IT SO AS LIKE WELL I WOULDN'T PRESCRIBE TO A PATIENT UNLESS I TRIED IT MYSELF SO ME AND ANOTHER DOCK IN THE PRACTICE RAPH WE READED IT FOR I DONT KNOW A COUPLE MONTHS I DIDN'T NOTICE A SINGLE THING INTERESTING THANK YOU FOR THAT A SHIFTING TO A LESS ESOTERIC BAND I THINK HATLE MORE IMPORTANT TOPIC OVER ALL METABYLOMICS FIING ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE SET DOWN TO RECORD WHAT WHAT IS WHAT ARE METABYLOMICS WHY SHOAL W BE THINKING ABOUT THEM I HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT IT MIGHT BE ABOUT A WHAT MOST PEOPLE I THINK ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT METABYLOMACS AT ALL AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE I'M SURE THEYCOULD LEARN MORE TELL US ABOUT METABYLOMICS IN WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF IN THE WORLD OF METABYLINES YESSO OMIC IS JUST THE TERM THAT WE USE TO DESCRIBE THE STUDY OF O SOMETHING SOR GENO MAKES RIIT IS LIKE THE BROADSTUDY OF GENES AND A YOU NO PROTIO MAKES THE BROADSTUDY OF PROTINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO SO METABYLAU MAKES US TO STUDY OF METABYLITES AND METABYLITES UNLIKE ALOT THESE OTHER THINGS THERE THERE R RELATIVELY FINITE NUMBER OF THESE THINGS A MANY OF WHICH ARE KNOWN BUT SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT KNOWN SO GLUECOSTS IS A METABYLITE THE SEETLE COE IS A METABYLIKE LACTATE ISAM MATABYLITE AND SO THE THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS AND HOW THEY WORK AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT CERTAIN PHYSIOLOGIC STATES AND THE METABYLOMAKE PROFILE THAT RESULTS FROM THEM SO WHAT'S USE TWO EXTREME EXAMPLES LIKE EXERCISE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE DATA ARE UNAMBIGUOUSLY CLEAR EXERCISE PRODUCE IS ABOUT THE MOST FAVORABLE PHENA TYPE IMAGINABLE SO IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE A GENOMIX APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT IS THERE WERE CHANGE IN THE GENOM WHEN YOU EXERCISE I THE ANSWERS  PROBABLY NOT BUT MAYBE MAYBE IF YOU LOOKED AT THE YOU KNOW MEPHYLATION PATTERNS AN EPIGENO YOU COUD LOOK AT EPIGENOMIC STUDIES A BUT YOU MIGHT INSTEAD LOOK AT KIND OF THE PRODIOMIC SIDE OF THAT LIKE WHAT IS GENE EXPRESSION DOING AND THERE YOU WOULD SEE A LOT OF CHANGES WELL WHAT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY UNDERSTANDING ALL THER WAS A VERY INTERESTING PAPER THAT JUST CAME OUT A TWO WEEKS AGO THAT LOOKS FOR NOVEL METABOLIGHTS THERRE CHANGEING ATSTHERE RE HUGE SIGNAL IN A METABYLOMIC PROFILE THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT IN THE STATE OF EXERCISE VERSES NON EXERCISE AND COULD THAT REPRESENT PART OF HOW EXERCISE IS TRANSMITTING ITS BENEFIT THROUGH THE BODY A YOUKNOW PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE HOLY GRAIL OF METABYLOMICS WO BE CAN YOU FIND PILL TO MIMIC EXERCISE AND I THINK THE INSTR THAT QUESTION IS GOING TO BE UNDOUTEDLY KNOW A FOR FOR COUPLE REASONS ONE EVEN IF YOU COULD MIMIC THE LONG GEVITY SORT OF LIFE SPAN PARTS OF IT YOU COULD NEVER MIMIC THE HEALTHSPAN PARTS OF IT BUT WHAT IF YOU COULD DO BOTH RIGHT WHAT IF THERE WERE SMALL MOLECULES THAT CAN REPLICATE SOME OF THE PROTECTIVE BENEFITS OF EXERCISE AND YOU COULD COMBINE THOSE WITH EXERCISE WHAT IF THOSE COULD BE TREATMENTS FOR OTHER DISEASE STATES LIKE DIABEDES THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS FIELD OF METABYLOMICS IS YOU KNW RELATIVELY UNTAPPED A AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY THE NEXT SORT OF FRONTIER SPEAKING OF FRONTIERS I HEAR A LOT NOWDAYS ABOUT GEOLP ONE AND FARMECHOLOGY THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT MIMIC OR INCREASED YOPY ONE DIRECTLY A WHO GO ON LIKE PEPTIDE A PEOPLE ARE TOLING ABOUT THIS AS THE BLOCK BUSTEROBE CITY DRUG I HAVEN'T HEARD WITS MUCH TALK ABOUT A DRUG TO A JUST HUMAN BODY WEIGHT A FAVORABLY SINCE THE DISCUSSIONS OF FENFIN WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND THEN OF COURSE VENVAN WAS PULLED FROM THE MARKET A BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE DYING ANOT LEFT IN RIGHT BUT ENOUGH PEOPLE DIED THAT THEY PLLED IT FOM THE MARKET A WHICH BY THEWY IS AN INTERESTING A STORY YOU KNOW IT WAS THE ENANTOMER THAT THEY CHOSE TO USE THAT WAS THE WRONG AND ANTOMER AND WHAT IT RESULTED IN WAS A I THINK IT WAS LIKE SO MITROVEL ET ELAPSE AS ID WAS AT ENV P AT WITH SOMETHING IN THE MITRAL VALVE A THE I THINK THE COURTETENDAN A WERE RUPTURIN AND THE MITRAL VAVE A AN   IT WAS MOSTLY YOUNG WOMEN I THINK WERE GETTING YOU KNOW HORRIBLE PULMINARY DISEASE AS A RESULT OF IT PROBABLY ULMINARY HIGH PRETENSION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AM BUT THERE WERE YOU KNOW THEREWARE TWO AN ANTOMERS OF THE DRUG AND HAD THEY JUST USED THE OTHER ONE THIS ISSUE WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED AND THERE WAS A STUPID REASON WHY THEY MADE THE CHOICE TO USE THE ONE THEY DID AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE ONCE YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE YOU'RE NEVER GOING BACK IT'S NOT LIKE THAT COMPANY COULD SAOE OWONE TO DO OVER BUT WE'RE GING TO DO IT WITH THE RIGHT VERSION SO IT'S A TRAGIC OUTCOME A BUT BUT YOU'RE ABSELY RIGHT I THINK THE GEOPE ONE AGONIS AR HAVE MORE EFFICACY A AND YOU KNOW A OR ALL INTENSITY AND FOR EVERYTHING WE CAN SEE CERTAINLY SEEM SAFER ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THEM I AM YA AND I THINK I THINK WE'RE JUST SEEING THE CONNATIPITHY ICEBERG THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT MIRACLE DRUGS RIGHT THEY COME WITH PROBLEMS RIGHT WHICH IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE CATABOLIC ACROSS THE BOARD SO PATIENTS ARE LOSING FAT BUT THEY'RE LOSING MUSCLE AS WELL SO YOU NOV DESCENDT ALL THAT THE A JIM JOCKEES RUNNING FROM SOME O  ANNO THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY I HAD TO SAY NOW IS ABOUT SOMETHING IS THAT IT'S GOING A DROPTASTOSTRON LOWER FERTILITY CHANGE SOME ONE SKIN HAIROR NAILS AND S LIKE PEOPLE IT CAN EXTEND LIFE TO BE TWO HUNDRED FOF TO YEARS ALL THAND PEOPLE ARE GONE FOMENS ARE HUMAN THAT'S A THAT'S A NURROU SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY ISSUE NOT A NOT A ABIOLOGY MENAS IN ISSUE BUT IM IM AT PLEASED TO HEAR THAT YOU'R SIDE BY THEM CAUS I I HEAR A LOT OF EXCITEMENT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING DISASTROUS ABOUT THEM IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET PEOPLE UP TO DOSE SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SEMICALLU TIED THE DOSE THAT WAS STUDIED IM SO TDID A WON YOUR TRIAL OR MAY BE AS LITTLE OVER THET IN SIXTY WEEKS BUT IT TOOK ABOUT SIXTEEN WEEKS TO GET THE PATIENTS COMFORTABLY UP TO TWO POINT FOR MELIGRAMS WEEKLY WHICH WAS THE DOSE THAT THEY ULTIMATELY STAYED ON IN OUR EXPERIENCE WHEN WE USE IT WE DON'T EVEN USUALLY GO UP TO TWO POINT FOR MELIGRAMS WE CAN USUALLY GET ENOUGH BENEFIT BETWEEN ONE AND TWO MELIGRAMS AND WE USUALLY MOVE PEOPLE ALONG A ITLE BIT QUICKER BUT WE'VE DEFINITELY HAD OUR SHARE OF PATIENTS WHO CAN'T TOLERATE IT DUE TO THE NAUSEA INTERESTING WHICH MIGHT BE PART OF HOW IT'S WORKING RIGHT IS THE SORT OF SUPPRESSION OF APPETITE WHICH HAVE TAKEN TO AN EXTREME CAN PRODUCE NAUSIA INTERESTING YOU I THINK MOST OF THE EFFECT OF OF SOMICALY TIED O CENTRAL NOT PERIFERAL SO I DON'T KNOW I SAW ONE PAPER THAT I GEL PE ONE IS ACTING BOTH ON CELLS IN IN THE PRIFERY I'M TWO CAUS GOT DISTENSION SOME WAYS THEIR SORT OF TMAKE PEOPLE FEEL FULL THROUGH PROMOTION OF A LITEALLY MECHANIC RECEPTORS THAT MAKE PEOPLE FEEL AS IF THEIR STOMACH IS TOSTENUD EVEN O THEIR STOMACH IS EMPTY AND THEN PERHAPS SOME CENTRAL HYPOTHOLAMIC OF FACTS IS THAT YEII THINK IT'S DOING I WOULD BET EIGHTY PERCENT OF ITS IN HYPOTHALEMIS IM IT IS ALSO IMPROVING INSOLENT SENSITIVITY IN THE PERIFERY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ACCOUNTING FOR MUCH OF ITS BENEFIT SUPERINTERESTING AN THERE'S NEXT GEN I VERSIONS AT ESE THAT SEEM TO BE MORE LONG LASTING SO RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT COMING OFF SEMI GLUE TIDE YOU'RE GING TO SEE A WEIGHT REGAIN SO THERE'S NEW REVERSIONS THAT SEEM TO PRESERVE THE WAIHT LOSS EVEN OFF THE DRUG TO BEGS THE ULTIMATE QUESTIOMICH IS LIKE WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE TOTAL USE CASE FOR THIS GONG TO BE AS THIS GON TO BE A DRUG YOU CYCHLE ON AND OFF OR AS IT GOING TO BE A DRUG THAT OF PERSON HAS TO STAY ON INDEFINITELY AND IF SO WILL THEY BECOME TACKY PHLACTIC WILL THEY GAIN YOU KNOW A RESISTANCE TO IT SUT STILL SUPEREARLY DAYS ON THESE THINGS MY HOPE IS THAT IT WOULD BE ALOTIT LIKE THE WAY THEYOU DESCRIBE TO STOSTRON IN ESTRGEN THERABIES THAT IT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO DO MORE OF THE BEHAVIORAL WORK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED FOR HELSEMEN AN LASTMEN YO AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT YOU CAN CHEA TRUE SENMICLUTI R PEOPLE WO YOU YOU CAN DRINK A LOT OF CALORIES AND SORT OF GET AROUND THE DRUG SO OU A FOREXAMPLE LIKE YOU DON'T WE WE ALWAYS INCOURAGE PATIENT WO WONE TA LOSE WAIT TO REALLY JUST ELIMINATE ALCOHOLIC THAT'S LIKE BUT'S THE CHEAPEST EASIEST TRICK TO TO LOSE WAY AND SO IF YOU'RE STILL DRINKING A LOT OF ALCOHOL WHICH IS INCREDIBLY COLORIC AND JUST DRINKING A LOT OF CLORIC STUFF IM WE'V SEEN THAT THAT'S LESS HITS IS JUSTANMIC TOTAL IN ARE WE ARE PATIENTSWULL BE SEEN THAT THAT'S IT'S EASIER TO GET AROUND THE BENEFITS OF OF THE DRUG BETWAY SI SO APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS TO DAY FIRST OF ALE THEY ARE INCREDIBLY THOROUGH UM AND POINTED TOWARDS REAL WORLD APPLICATION UM I'LL SO JUST WONE O THANK YOU MORE BROADLY FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO BECAUSE I SEE YOU HAVE THIS A INCREDIBLE

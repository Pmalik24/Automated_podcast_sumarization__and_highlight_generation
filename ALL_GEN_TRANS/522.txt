WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LATPONCAS S SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  FOR I MANDRHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGRENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOPMICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WO'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PETASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES IN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION END THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLITES IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WIH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO E LEMENT ELEMENTI DOTCAM SLASH HUBERMAN TO DAY IS THE THIRD EPISODE AND OUR SERIES OF EPISODES ABOUT PHYSICAL AND ATHLETIC SKILL PERFORMANCE AND SKILL LEARNING IN GENERAL AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF TOOLS FOR FAT LOSS AND FAT LOSS IS SOMETHING THAT INTERESTS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE WANT TO LOSE FAT MANY PEOPLE ARE ATHLEES WO NEED TO LOSE FAT AND IN GENERAL WE KNOW THAT HAVING BODY FAT PERCENTAGES THAT ARE TOO HIGH IS ONHEALTHY FOR US AND MOST PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO LOSE FAT MOST PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO LOSE WEIGHT GENERALLY BUT MOST PEOPLE ESPECIALLY STRUGGLE TO LOSE BODY FAT OR WHAT WE CALL ATAPOST TISSUE NOW THIS IS A HUGE TOPIC ON THE INTERNETE THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS RELATED TO FAT LOSS AND THAT ARE POWERFUL FOR FAT LOSS THAT I'M GUESSING MOST OF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD ABOUT BEFORE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT A FEW OF THEM BUT I'M GESSING YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT ALL OF THEM THIS EPISODE IS GOING TO BE RICH WITH SCIENCE BASED TOOLS THAT ARE GLEANED FROM A VARIETY OF ASPECTS OF THE LITERATURE INCLUDING THE USE OF COLD IMCLUDING BROWN FAT INCLUDING SOMETHING CALLED BAGE FAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED NEAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL SORTS OF ASPECTS OF FAT LOSS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THIS IS I THINK AND IMPORTANT GAP THAT'S MISSING IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FAT LOSS YOU CAN HEAR A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT THE ROLE OF THINGS LIKE INSULIN AND VARIOUS DIETS LIKE KETOGENIC DIETS ARE VIGAN DIETS OR MEDITERRANEAN DIETS AND THERERE SOME GREAT STUFF OUT THERE AND THERES SOME REALLY TERRIBLE INFORMATION OUT THERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY WE DID A NUMBER OF EPISODES TALKING ABOUT THE ROLL OF HORMONS ON METABOLISM END THE ROLE OF FOOD ON MOOD AND WELL BEING SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THOSE TOPICS PLEASE CHECK THEM OUT I WILL TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON HORMONES TO DAY THINGS LIKE INSOLEN AND LEPT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT TODAY IS EPISODE IS MAINLY GOING TO BE FOCUSSED ON HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NURNS AND SOME OF THE SELS THEY COLLABORATE WITH LIKE GLEA AND MACROPHAGES HOW THOSE IN COURAGE OR CANNIN COURAGE ECCELERATED FAT LOSS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEY CAN REMEMBER YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR SPINAL CORD AND ALL THE CONNECTIONS THAT THEY MAKE WITH THE ORGANS OF THE BODY GOVERNS EVERYTHING IT'S THE ON SWITCH AND THE OFF SWITCH FOR UMUNE SYSTEM IT'S THE ON SWITCH AND THE OFF SWITCH IT TURNS OUT ALSO FOR FAT BURNING AND SO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE ROLE OF THE BRAIN AND OTHER NURONS HAS BEEN VASTLY OVERLOOKED IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT LOSING FAT NOW I WOULD BE REMISS AND I'D PROBABLY COME UNDER PRETTY CONSIDERABLE ATTACK IF I DIDN'T JUST ACKNOWLEDGE UPFRONT A COR TRUTH OF METABOLIC SCIENCE AND ALSO OF NERO SCIENCE FRANKLY WHICH IS THAT C ALORIES IN VERSES CALORIES OUT MEANING HOW MANY CALORIES YOU INJEST VERSES HOW MANY CALRIES YOU BURN IS THE FUNDAMENTAL AND MOST IMPORTANT FORMULA IN THIS BUSINESS OF FAT LOSS AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT IN GENERAL THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY AROUND THE FACT THAT IF YOU INJEST FAR MORE CALORIES THAN YOU BURN YOUR LIKELY TO GAIN WEIGHT AND A GOOD PORTION OF THAT WEIGHT IS LIKELY TO BE ADIPOST TISSUE FAT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IF YOU INJEST FO YOUR CALORIES THAN YOU BURN THAT YOU WILL LOSE WEIGHT AND THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT WILL COME FROM BODY FAT WHAT PORTION DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF FACTORS BUT THAT SIMPLE FORMULA IS IMPORTANT ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE I MENTION THE COMPLICATIONS WITH THE STATEMENTS OF A CALORY IS A CALORY AND INDEED THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM FOR INSTANCE ROBERT LUSTIG WHOS A PEDIATRIC ANTECHRONOLOGIST THAT YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO IS TALKED ABOUT HOW HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE UTILIZE FOOD AND CAN LEAD TO HIGHER INCIDENCEIS OF OBICITY AND OTHER METABOLIC CYNDRUMS THAT GO AGAINST THE IDEA THAT A CALOR IS A CALORY AND THAT'S IT SO A CALORY IS A CALORY AS A UNIT OF ENERGY AND WE NEED TO ACCEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THIS CALORIES IN MEANING CALRIES INJESTED VERSES CALORIES BURNED FORMULA BUT THE CALORIES BURNED PORTION IS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN CONTROL THAT CAN GREATLY ACCELORYTE OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ADIPOST TISSUE OR THE PROPORTION OF ADIPOST TISSUE THAT YOU BURN IN RESPONSE TO EXERCISE AND FOOD SO YOUR HORMONES ARE IMPORTANT YOUR THERMOGENIC MILOU MEANING HOW WARM OR HOW COLD YOUR BODY IS HOW COLD YOU MAKE IT HOW WARM YOU MAKE IT BUT ALSO YOUR LEVEL OF METABOLISM YOUR LEVELS OF THIEROID HORMONE END SOMETHING THAT'S HARDLY EVER DISCUSSE BUT IS WELL SUPPORTED BY TE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE HOW MUCH INERVATION MEANING HOW MUCH CONACTIVITY THERE IS BETWEEN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND FAT TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE THE FACT THAT YOUR BODY FAT OF VARIOUS KINDS AND THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF BODY FAT ARE ACTUALLY INERVATED BY NURANS NURANS CONNECT TO YOUR BODY FAT AND CAN CHANGE THE PROBABILITY THAT THAT BODY FAT WILL BE BURNED OR NOT SO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THE MASTER CONTROLLER OF THIS PROCESS AND IT PLAYS A STRONG ROLL IN THE CALORIES OUT THE CALORIES BURNED COMPONENT SO AS USUAL WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT OF SCIENCE I PROMISE I WON'T GO TOO DEEP INTO LIKE POLISISTS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS RELATED TO FAT OXIDATION WE'RE GOING TO BREAK DOWN THAT PROCESS INTO TOO IMPORTANT STEPS AND IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THOSE TWO IMPORTANT STEPS THAN THE REST OF THE TOOLS WILL BE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT TO DAY YOU WILL WALK AWAY WITH MANY NEW TOOLS THAT YOU COULD INCORPORATE INTO ANY KIND OF FAT LOSS REGIMEN THAT WILL GREATLY ECCELERATE THAT PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S GROUNDED IN QUALITY PERE REVIEWED SCIENCS THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME BEHAVIORAL TOOLS IN FACT I'LL MOSTLY TALK ABOUT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS I WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT COMPOUNDS SUPPLEMENTS MANY OF YOU ARE INTO SUPPLEMENTS SOME OF YOU AREN'T AND THAT'S FINE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTO SUPPLEMENTS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS FOR FAT LOSS OR OTHERWISE IS GOING TO BE THE QUALITY OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTS AND THE ACCURACY ABOUT WHAT'S IN THOSE SUPPLEMENT BOTTLES AND TABLETS ET CETERA I USUALLY MENTION THIS AT THE END OF THE PODCAST BUT THIS PODCAST WE'VE PARTNERED WITH THORN T H OR AND E BECAUSE THORN WE BELIEVE HAS THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF STRINGENCY IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THE COMPOUNDS IN THEIR SUPPLEMENTS AND THE AMOUNTS OF THOSE COMPOUNDS IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE SUPPLEMENTS I TAKE YOU CAN GO TO THORN DOK COMS SLASH THE LETTER YOU SLASH HUBERMEN YOU CAN SEE THE SUPPLEMENTSTHAT I TAKE THAT WILL ALSO ALLOW YOU TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTS OR TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF THE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS THAT THORN MAKES THORN HAS PARTNERED WITH  THE MAO CLINIC AND ALL THE MAJOR SPORTSTEAMS SO THERE'S A VERY STRONG BASIS FOR THEIR STRINGENCY AGAIN YOU DON'T NEED TO U SUPPLEMENTS I'M CERTAINLY NOT ENCOURAGING ANY ONE TO U SUPPLEMENTS IF THAT'S NOT YOUR THING BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO U SUPPLEMENTS MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SUPPLEMENT SOURCE IS ONE OF VERY HIGH QUALITY WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO GET STARTED AND TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS TOOLS FOR FAT LOSS AND HOU NURO SCIENCE NURONS CONTROL FAT LOSS BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO SET THE CONTEXT CORRECTLY AND EXTRACT SOME OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM PREVIOUS EPISODES BECAUSE IF YOUR FOUNDATION OF HEALTH AND YOUR FOUNDATION OF HORMONES AND YOUR FOUNDATION OF METABOLISM ISN'T RIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO GET THE MOST OUT OF ANY KIND OF EXERCISE OR FAT LOSS PROTOCOL IN PREVIOUS EPISODES I TALKED ALL ABOUT THE SCIENTS AND THE DETAILS GOING INTO PARTICULAR PROTOCOLS WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO THAT NOW AND I WANT TO GET TO THE NEW MATERIAL HOWEVER THERE ARE COUPLE BINS A COUPLE ITEMS THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOUR GETTING CORRECTLY AND IF YOU'RE NOT PERFECT ABOUT THESE DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT PERFECT ABOUT THEM I'M CERTAINLY NOT PERFECT ABOUT THEM BUT WE SHOULD ALL BE STRIVING TO GET QUALITY AND SUFFICIENT SLEEP I DID FOUR FUL EPISODES ON SLEEP AND HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING THROUGH THINGS LIKE LIGHT EXPOSURE TEMPERATURE TIMING YOUR SLEEP CORRECTLY FOR YOUR SO CALLED CHRONOTYPE IF YOU'RE NIGHT OWL OR MORNING PERSON THAT'S THE FIRST FOR WHER I THINK FIVE EPISODES OF THE HUBERMEN LAD PODCAST GET YOUR SLEEP RIGHT GET YOUR LIGHT EXPOSURE RIGHT AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES AT TIMES YOU WANT TO BE ASLEEP AND GET RIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES AT TIMES YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE SO GET YOUR SLEEP RIGHT THE OTHER THING IS ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE FOOD AND MOOD EPISODE BUT I ALSO TALKED ABOUT IT DURING THE HORMONES EPISODES WE NEED FATY ACIDS THEY ARE VITAL TO SO MANY ASPECTS OF OUR HEALTH YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET THEM FROM SUPPLEMENTS YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO BUT YOU NEED TO GET THEM FROM YOUR FOOD THEY ARE ESSENTIAL AS A REASON THERE IS AN E THE ESSENTIAL PART THERE OFE THE FAT ACIDS THEIR MULTIBLE KINDS BUT FOR THE ANTI DEPRESSINTE FECTS OR THE IFTHE LEVELS OF FATY ACIDS THAT WILL PROMOTE GOOD MOOD AND ALSO HEALTHY METABOLISM AND WILL START TO SHIFT THE NEEDLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON BLOOD BORN CARTIOVASCULAR FACTORS THE KEY THING IS TO GET THE LEVELS OF E P A THAT YOU INJEST ABOVE ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS PER DAY SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN JUST TAKING A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS ARE MORE OF SAY FISH OIL OR CRILLOIL OR WHATEVER YOUR PREFERRED SOURCS IT MEANS GETTING ABOVE A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF E P A WHICH MAY REQUIRE THAT YOU INJEST MORE ESSENTIAL FATYACIDS THAN JUST A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS PER DAY THAT OF COURSE CAN BE DONE THROUGH FOOD SOURCES THINGS LIKE FATY FISH OR IF YOU'RE NOT OF IF YOU'RE NOT INTO EATING FISH YOU QUALITY NEATS THAT ARE GRAS RAYS CAN DO THAT THEIR ARE OTHER SOURCES OF ESSENTIAL FATYACIDS OF COURSE ALSO FROM PLANT SOURCES SO LOOK THOSE UP ON LINE T'S REALLY EASY TO FINE BUT THE RESEARCH IN THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT YOU WANT TO GET ABOVE A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS O E P A PER DAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN BEST SUPPORT YOUR METABLISM AND POSITION YOURSELF FOR GOOD FATLOSS AS WELL FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE CRAVINGS ISSUES THEY THEY CRAVE SWEETS ALL THE TIME I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE GUT BRAIN EPISODE AND HORMONES AND FOOD THEY YU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR GUT THAT ARE CRAVING THEIR SEEKING ESSENTIAL FATYACIDS AND THEIRE CRAVING AND SEEKING A MENO ACIDS FROM YOUR FOOD NOW THESE ARE NOT SUPPLEMENTS THAT THEY CRAVE PER SAY THEIR CRAVING THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOUR BODY NEEDS IN YOUR BRAIN NEEDS BUT THOSE SAME NURONS WILL RESPOND TO SUGARS AND SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE CRAVING SUGAR CAN SATISFY THAT SUGAR CRAVING BY GIVING THE NURONS SO TO SPEAK WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT WHICH ARE A MENO ACIDS AND ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS THAT INCLUDES E P A BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE GLUDOMINE AND A MENO ACID THAT CAN REALLY REDUCE SUGAR CRAVINGS IF YOU TAKE A TEASPOON OF THAT OR EVEN A TABLE SPOON OF THAT A FEW TIMES TO DAY YOU HAVE TO EASE INTO THAT LOBIT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CAN GET A LITLE BIT OF GEI DISTRESS FROM TOO MUCH GLUDOMINE BUT GLUDOMINE HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF LEEKY GUT IT'S A POWERFUL A MENO ACID AND YES YOU CAN ALSO GET IT FROM FOOD THANGS LIKE COTTAGE CHEESE ARE HIGH IN GLUTOMINE ET CETERA AND THEN FINALLY YOU CAN'T REALLY POSITION YOURSELF TO HAVE A STRONG METABOLISM IF YOUR IODINE LEVELS AREN'T CORRECT IN YOUR THIROID LEVELS AREN'T CORRECT YOU CAN OVERDO IODONS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT A LOT OF TABLE SALT HAS IODINE ADDED TO IT BUT SOME PEOPLE NEED TO AD IODINE THEY BY INJESTING THINGS LIKE KELP ET CETERA BUT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO SUPPORT THE THIROID SYSTEM AND METABOLISM IN GENERAL IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR GETTING ENOUGH CYLENNIUMS SOMETIMES CALLED CELENIUM EACH DAY SIMPLE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO INJEST THE HIGHEST C NCENTRATION OF CELENNIUM FOOD THAT I'M AWARE OF WHICH IS BRAZIL NUTS ONE OR TWO OR THREE OF THOSE PER DAY YOU'LL HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH CELENIUM A TO MEET THE THIROID NEEDS YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CLENNIUM TO BE TOO HIGH YOU DON'T WANT A DIET TOO HIGH IN ANYTHING SO AGAIN SLEEP SUFFICIENT EPES GLUDOMINE IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH LEEKI GUT OR SUGAR CRAVINGS CAN REALLY HELP GET YOUR GOT MICROBIOM RIGHT I MAY HAVE A MISSAING THAT BUT GET YOUR GOT MICROBIOM RIGHT THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEANINGING TO INJEST PROBIOTICS YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO BUT YOU CAN ALSO JUST SIMPLY INJUST A SERVING OR TWO OF FERMENTED FOODS PER DAY THAT CAN GREATLY ASSISTS O THINGS LIKE SAUER KROW KIMCHI EVERY CULTURE HAS A DIFFERENT A SOURCE OR SOURCES OF FERMENTED FOODS THOSE CAN REALLY HELP TH THE GOT MICROBYUM AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR THIROID HORMONAS SUPPORTED THROUGH THE INGESTION OF SUFFICIENT IODIN NOT TOO MUCH AND SUFFICIENT CELENNIUM NOT TOO MUCH OKE SLEEP EPIE GLUDIMINE FERMENTED FOODS IODINE CELLENNIUM THAT SETS THE BASIS FOR HOW THINGS LIKE EXERCISE COLD AND SOME OF THE COMPOUNDS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WEREGON TO TALK ABOUT TO DAY THAT ARE I'M GUESSING TRULY CONTO BE TRULY NEW TO MANY OF YOU THAT CAN REALLY INCREASE THE BURN FACTOR IN THE EQUATION OF CALLORIES IN VERSES CALORIES BUT BURNED OKE SO ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE THIS REALITY OF CALORIES IN VERSES CALORIES BURNED HOWEVER I WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION AND INCREDIBLE STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY MY COLLEAGUE A LEA CRUM AT STAMFORD SHE'S A FACULTY MEMBER PROFESSOR IN THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT HOW BELIEF EFFECTS JUST THINKING CAN IMPACT THE EFFECTS OF THINGS LIKE EXERCISE ON WEIGHT LOSS THESE ARE JUST INCREDIBLE RESULTS WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY TOOK SUBJECTS WHO WERE HOTEL SERVICE PEOPLE THAT WOULD CLEAN THE HOTELS AND COME IN AND CHANGE THE THE LINENS AND SO FORTH DIVIDE THEM INTO TWO GROUPS ONE GROUP THEY WERE WERE TOLD MOVING AROUND AND DOING YOUR DUTIES FOR YOUR JOB A MEAT THE STANDARDS FOR YOU ESGIDE LINES FOR ACTIVITY AN MOVEMENT ET CETERA AND A BASIC LECTURE ABOUT HOW MOVEMENT IS GOOD FOR YOU ET CETERA BUT MOSTLY JUST THAT THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES MET THE STANDARDS FOR THE YU AS THE OTHER GROUP HOWEVER WAS GIVEN A BUNCH OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MOVEMENT AND THEIR DAILY ROUTINE WAS VERY GOOD FOR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IT COULD BE GOOD FOR WEIGHT LOSS ET CETERA AND THEN THEY TRACKED THESE SUBJECTS OVER A PERIOD OF MANY WEEKS THE TAKE CO MESSAGE FROM THI STUDY WAS THAT SIMPLY BEING TOLD THAT MOVEMENT IS GOOD FOR YOU CAN LEAD TO WEIGHT LOSS ET CETERA LED TO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BODY FAT LOSS WASTE A HIPORATIO CHANGES IN THE DIRECTION THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD WANT ESSENTIALLY ASLIMMING DOWN IF YOU WILL AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THINGS LIKE CARTIOVASCULAR HEALTH SIMPLY BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE CAN HELP VARIOUS HEALTH MARKERS SO THIS IS REMARKABLE AND EXPEAKS TO THE POWER OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AN THE POWER OF BELIEF IN GOVERNING ASPECTS OF OUR BODY IN OUR PHYSIOLOGY THAT ONE WOULD OTHERWISE THINK WERE OUTSIDE OUR CONSCIOUS CONTROL NOW OF COURSE ANY OF YOU THAT THINK SCIENTIFICALLY WHICH IMAGINE IF YOU WATCH THIS PODCASER LIST IN T THIS PODCAS IS ALL OF YOU BY NOW PROBABLY THINKING WELL MAYBE THEY JUST MOVED AROUND MORE MAYBE A UNODATES A STOOD UP IN AND SAT DOWN MORE MAYBE THEY THEY DID SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS DIFFERENT AND INDEED THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THEY DID THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OTHER GROUP BUT THE MURER KNOWLEDGE THAT EXERCISES GOOD FOR YOU THAT MOVEMENT IS GOOD FOR YOU SHIFTED THEIR BEHAVIOR AND THEIR PHYSIOLOGY IN THE DIRECTION OF ENHANCED WEIGHT LOSS FAT LOSS ET CETERA SO HOW WE THINK ABOUTY GIVEN SET OF ACTIVITIES AFFECTS HOW WE PERFORM THOSE ACTIVITIES AND HOW WE THINK AND PERABOUT AND PERFORM THOSE ACTIVITIES HAS A REAL EFFECT ON OUR PHYSIOLOGY SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE HARDENED FAST RULE THAT GOVERNS FAT LOSS AND WEIGHT LOSS WHICH IS IF YOU INJEST MORE CALORIES THAN YOU BURN YOU'LL EITHER MAINTAIN OR GAINWEIGHT TYPICALLYALL GAINWEIGHT ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS IF YOU INJEST ABAUT AS MANY CALORIES AS YOU BURN YOU MAINTAINWEIGHT TYPICALLY AND IF YOU INJEST FEWER CALORIES THAN YOU BURN TYPICALL YOU'LL LOSE WEIGHT THAT'S THE KIND OF RULE OF FAT LOSS AND YET WE ALSO HAVE THESE BELIEF OF FACTS WHICH SHOW AND THIS HAS BEEN REPLICATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT HOW WE THINK ABOUT A PROCESS WHETHER NOT WE THINK ITS BENEFICIAL CAN CHANGE OUR PHYSIOLOGY IN WAYS THAT CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO US SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO EXTREMES OF HARD CORMENT METABOLIC SCIENCE AND BELIEF OF FACTS WHY A BUNCH OF PROTOCALS THAT ARE GROUNDED IN QUALITY PERE REVIEWED SCIENCE AND IN PHYSIOLOGY THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE TO INCREASE THE RATES OF FAT LOSS AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GON A TALK ABOUT TO DAY I LOVE THIS TOPIC AND IT'S NOT THAT I'M SO OBSESTED WITH FAT LOSS BUT RATHER THE FIRST PROJECT I EVER WORKED ON IN SCIENCE WAS THERMOGENESIS AND FAT LOSS I JOINED A LABORATORY AS AN UNDERGRADUATE AND THE GUY WORK FOR LOVED TO EXPLORE NEW COMPOUNDS AND HOW THEY IMPACTED THERMAGENESIS AND SO WE LOOKED AT HOW THINGS LIKE EMDIAMA ECSTASY AH HOW ANTICYCOTICS ANTI DEPRESSENCE A VARIOUS WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS THAT WERE ON THE MARKET HOW THOSE IMPACTED BODY TEMPERATURE AND FAT LOSS AND METABOLISM AND WE DESHAD SO MUCH FUN DOING IT SO IF YOU DETECT A SMILE ON MY FACE THAT'S A THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ABOUT AND I ALSO LEARNED A LOT AND I ALSO CAME TO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THIS TISSUE OF OUR BODIES ADAPOS TISSUE IN FAT WE THINK OF I S JUST THI UNFORTUNATE THING THIS LIKE WERE TOLD IT'S A POR ENERGY SORES IF WE EVER ENTERED A FAMINE AND THAT'S ALL TRUE ET CETERA COME TO REALIZE THAT THE CELLS IN OUR BODY THEY ARE THERE AS FUEL FOR THE FURNACE OF OUR BODY WHICH IS OUR MATAPOLISM AND THERE'S A THIRD PLAYER AND THAT'S WHEREIT REALLY GETS INTERESTING THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NURONS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN UP THE INTENSITY THAT FURNASE IT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE AMOUND OF HEAT THAT WE PRODUCE AND THEREFORE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WE BURN AND I WAS ALSO REALLY ENTRIGUE BY SOMETHING WHICH IS THAT GROWING UP I THINK WE ALL NO PEOPLE WHO CAN EAT A TON AND NEVER SEEM TO GAIN ANY BODY FAT OR PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO EAT VERY LITTLE AND SEEM TO GAIN BODY FAT VERY EASILY AND I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUE BY THAT AND TURNS OUT THERE ARE NUMBER DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT RELATE TO THAT BUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THE ONE THAT WE CAN REALLY CONTROL BOT THROUGH BEHAVIORS IN WHAT WE EAT BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THIS THING THAT WE CALL THERMOGENISIS THE WAS ONE PARTICULAR STORY I WANT TO RELATE TO YOU THAT DOES NOT SUGGEST ANY PROTOCAL IN FACT I'M GOING TO DISCOURAGE YOU FROM FOLLOWING THIS PROTOCALL PLEASE DO NOT TRY THE COMPOUND THAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE ONE OF THE FAVORITE THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO DO IN THAT LAB WAS TO FIND RARE COMPOUNDS AND TESTS THEM AND AT THE TIME I WAS READING ABOUT THERMOGENESIS AND I LEARNED ABOUT A COMPOUND THAT WAS ACTUALLY DISCOVERED IN THE ARMORY FACTORIES OF WER WAR TOO AND IT WAS DISCOVERED BECAUS WOMEN IN PARTICULAR WHO WERE WORK IN THESE FACTORIES WOULD TAKE A A BRUSH AND DIP IT IN A COMPOUND AR A PAINT RATHER AND THEY WOULD THAN PAINT THE NUMBERS WITH A STENSIL ON TO THINGS LIKE BOMBS AND AND A AMMUNITION OF VARIOUS KINDS AND THEY WERE LOSING WEIGHT LIKE CRAZY AND TURNS OUT THAT OCCASION THEYD LICK THE BRUSH AND THEN THEY WOULD GO BACK JUST TO GET A A SHARPER POINT ON THE BRUSH AND THEN THEY WOULD A PAINT ON TO THESE A VARIOUS YOBULLETS AND A AND MISSILES AND SO FORTH BOMBS AND SO FORTH AND THEY STARTED SHEDDING ALL THEIR BODY FAT AND MANY OF THEM LOSED EXCUSE ME LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR WEIGHT WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING ELSE THAT THEY WERE DOING WHAT THEY WERE EATING ET CETERA TURNED OUT THAT THAT COMPOUND IS SOMETHING CALLED DYNNITROPHENALE D N P AND OVER THE YEARS DYNATROPHINALE D M P HAS GAINED POPULARITY IN SOME NICHE CULTURES MAINLY BODY BUILDERS ATHLEATES EVEN IN THE AN A MODELLING INDUSTRY IT IS A ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE COMPOUND FOR ANY ONE TO USE BECAUSE IT'S HIGHLY FATAL IF YOUR BODY TEMPERTURE GOES TOO HIGH HYPERTHERMIA WILL KILL YOU AND INDEED MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED USING DYNATROPHINALE AS A WEIGHT LOS DRUG OR ATTEMPTING TO USES THE WEIGHT LOSS DRUG BUT DYNA TROPINALE REALLY ILLUSTRATES A PRINCIPLE WHICH IS THAT YOUR YOUR METABOLISM INCLUDES THINGS LIKE DIROID HORMONING GROWTH HORMONE ET CETERA BUT YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE AND THE WAY YOU UTILIZE ENERGY IS CONTROLLED BY YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE WAY DYNITROPHENAL WORKS IS BY CHANGING THE NURONS AND THE WAY THAT THE NURONS THAT CONNECT TO FAT CHANGE THE WAY FAT BURNS UP SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO SUGGEST I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU USED DYNATROPHENAL HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT CAN CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE NURONS AND THE FAT OF YOUR BODY IN WAYS THAT CAN POWERFULLY ECCELERATE FAT LOSS AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DON'T HEARE ABOUT THESE THINGS MORE BUT PROBABLY BECAUSE MOST OF WHAT YOU SEE OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET FOCUSES MORE ON WHAT YOU COULD EAT AND SHOULD EAT OR SHOULDN'T EAT IT CONCENTRATES ON EXERCISE REGIMENTS WHICH WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT BUT THE BURN FACTOR YOUR THERMOGENIC ENVIRONMENT IS ONE OF THE IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS OF FAT LOSS AND SINCE I'M A NEURO SCIENTISTS THAT'S WHAT WERECAN TALK ABOUT SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FAT UTILIZATION LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW FAT IS CONVERTED INTO ENERGY WHICH IS SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED FAT BURNING WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO KNOW IS THAT THIS IS A TWO PART PROCESS KIN REALITY THERE ARE MANY BIO CHEMICAL STEPS AND IF YOU LOG ON TO THE INTERNET OR YOU OPEN UP A TEX BOOK AND YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT FAT UTILIZATION YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF CHEMISTRY AND I'M HAPPY TO GO DEEP INTO THAT CHEMISTRY IF YOU LIKE BUT I THINK MOST OF YOU ARE PROBABLY INTERESTED IN WHAT ARE THE LEVERAGE POINTS WHERE CAN YOU EXERT CONTROL OVER THIS PROCESS IN WAYS THAT BENEFIT YOU SO I'M GOING TO FOCUS MAINLY ON THOSE K THIS IS NOT TO UPSET THE OFFYCIONATOS AND I WILL PUT IN SOME NOMEN CLATURE BUT HERE WE GO THERE'S TWO PARTS TO THIS PROCESS ONE IS FAT MOBILIZATION AND THE SECOND IS FAT OCCIDATION OR UTILIZATION OKE SO THE FIRST THING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN FOR BODY FAT TO GET BURNED UP OR USED AND REDUSED IS THAT IT HAS TO GET MOBILIZED AND THAT'S A PROCESS CALLED LIKE POLICIS BUT I ECTLY DON'T CARE IF YOU KNOW THE NAME LIKE POLYCIS YOU JUST HAVE TO MOVE THAT FAT OUT OF THE POSITION THAT IT'S IN YOU HAVE TO GET IT OUT OF THE FAT CELLS RIGHT FAT CELLS CAN BE VICERAL AROUND OUR VICER OUR ORGANS OR THE CAN BE SUBCUTANEOUS UNDER OUR SKIN MOST PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT FAT SO HERE'S THE DEAL AND IF YOUR WANT MORE DETAIL GREAT I'LL TOUCH ON THAT IN A BIT BUT BASICALLY STORED FAT HAS TWO PARTS THAT ARE RELEVANT HERE IT'S GOT THE FATTYACID PART AND THAT'S THE PART THAT YOUR BO DY CAN USE AND THAT'S ATTACHED TO SOMETHING CALLED GLICERALE AND THEY'R LINKED BY A BACKBONE S ALREADY PROBABLY TOO MUCH CHEMISTRY FOR BOTH YOU BUT WHAT YOU WANT IS YOU WANT TO BREAK THE BACKBONES IF YOU JUST CAN REMEMBER TO MOBILIZE FAT YOUGET T BREAK THE BACKBONE BETWEEN GLICER ALL THESE FATYACIDS OK THAT'S ACCOMPLISH BY AN ENSIM CALLED LIPASE BUT YOU CAN FOR GET ALL THAT IF YOU WANT REMEMBER WERE JUST TRYN TO MOBILIZE FAT SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO GET THOSE FATTY ACIDS MOVING AROUND IN THE BLOOD STREAM TO GET THEM OUT OF THOSE FAT CELLS AND THEN THEY CAN TRAVEL AND BE USED FOR ENERGY AND THAT SECOND PART REMEMBER FIRST PART IES MOBILIZATION THE SECOND PART IS OXIDATION IS THEN THOSE FATTY ACIDS THOSE ARE POTENTIAL FUEL THEY'RE JUST POTENTIAL FUEL BUT YOU HAVEN'T BURN THE FAT YET YOU'VE JUST MOVED IT OUT OF YOUR FAT CELLS THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO CELLS THAT CAN USE THEM FOR ENERGY AND ONCE THEY ARE INSIDE THOSE CELLS THEY'RE STILL NOT BURNED UP YOU NEED A OXIDIZE THEM THINK OXIDATION IS TO BURN UP PART THEY NEED TO BE MOVED INTO THE MITOCONDRIA AND THEN THEY CAN BE CONVERTED INTO A T P INTO ENERGY SO JUST TO REALLY ZUMOUT AGAIN TO MAKE SUR I DON'T LOSE ANYBODY YOU GOT A MOBILIZE THE FAT THAN YOU HAVE TO OXIDIZE THE FAT YOU HAVE TO IN OTHER WORD YOU HAVE TO MOBILIZE IT THAN YOU ACTULY HAVE TO CONVERT IT INTO ENERGY IF YOU JUST MOBILIZE IT AND YOU DON'T CONVERT IT INTO ENERGY YOU DON'T OXIDIZE IT IT CAN BE RETURNED TO BODY FAT AND MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN DO IS TO INCREASE THE MOBILIZATION OF FAT BUT ALSO THE OXIDATION OF FAT OCASO YOU HAVE TOO OPPORTUNITIES TO BURN MORE FAT AND BOTH OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE GOVERNED BY YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BY NURONS THAT LITERALLY SEND LITTLE WIRES THAT WE CALL AXONS INTOO FAT AND RELEASE CHEMICALS THAT PROVIDE A STIMULUS FOR MORE OF THAT FAT TO BE MOBILIZE AND THEN LATER FOR MORE OF THAT FAT TO BE BURNED UP OK SO WE COULD GO REALLY DEEP ON THIS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GO MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T A BY A CHEMISTRY OF FATYACID METABOLISM LECTURE THIS IS ABOUT HOW TO BURN FAT USING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT REMEMBER THERE'S A MOBILIZATION STEP AND THEN THERE'S AN OXIDATION STEP I THINK ANY ONE VIEW ALL OF YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERNALIZE THAT MOBILIZE THEN OXIDIZE OK MOBILIZE THAN OXIDIE SO WHAT ARE THESE NURONS THAT CONNECT O FAT DOING WHAT ARE THEY RELEASING EXACTLY HOW DO THEY ACTUALLY INCREASE FATMOBILIZATION AND HOW DO THEY INCREASE FAT OXIDATION BURNING OF FAT WELL THERE ARE COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THEY RELEASE THAT INCOURAGE THAT PROCESS AND THE MAIN ONE THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IS EPINEFERAN OR A DRENALIN THE CONVERSION OF THESE FATTY ACIDS INTO A T P IN THE MITOCONDRY OF CELLS IS FAVORED BY A DRENALINE OK AND A DRENOLIN IS RELEASED FROM TWO SOURCES A DRENALINE IS RELEASED FROM THE ADRENAL GLANCE WHICH CYTO TOPARCIDNEYS AN OUR LOWER BAT AND IT'S ALSO RELEASED FROM THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THAT NAME IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO A SYMPATHY HAS TO DO WITH STIMULATING A LERTNESS AND PROMOTING ACTION OF THE BODY THERE'S A BIG MISTAKE IN THE LITERATURE THAT IS FINALLY BEING CORRECTED AMONG THOSE WHO KNOW THE MISTAKE IN THE LITERATURE IS THAT THE ADRENAL GLANDS AND THE RELEASE OF A DRENALINE IS WHAT STIMULATES FAT LOSS AND FATOXIDATION IN FACT IT WAS THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME THAT A DRENALINE SWIMMING AROUND IN YOUR BODY OF WHEN YOU'RE FASTED BECAUSE FASTING CAN INCREASE A DRENALINE OR WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGING AN INTENSE EXERCISEOR WHEN YOU'R STRESSE IS GOING TO PROMOTE FAT OXIDATION THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE CASE THE A DRENALINE THAT STIMULATES FAT OXIDATION THE BURNING OF FAT IS COMING FROM NURONS THAT ACTUALLY CONNECT TO THE FAT NOT HORMONES LIKE A DRENALIE THAT ARE SWIMMING AROUND IN YOUR SYSTEM IT'S A LOCAL PROCESS AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT WHAT YOU DO THE SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF MOVEMENTS AND THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT YOU CREATE THAT CAN STIMULATE THESE PARTICULAR NURONS TO ACT OFATE FAT MEANING TO RELEASE FAT TO MOBILIZE IT AND THEN TO BURN IT IS GOING TO BE A POWERFUL LEVER THAT YOU CAN USE IN ORDER TO INCREASE FAT LOSS SO WHAT HAVE WE SAID SO FAR WE'VE SAID THAT YOU GOT IMOBILIZING OUT O BURN FAT AND THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS IN CONTROL OF THAT PROCESS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CALORY DEFICIT OK SO LET'S TALK ABOUT POW TO ACTIVATE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN WAYS THAT IT PROMOTES MORE LIBERATION MOVEMENT MOBILIZATION OF FAT AND MORE OXIDATION OF FAT SO ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WAYS TO STIMULATE EPINEPRON WHICH IS ALSO CALLED A DRENALINE FROM THESE NURONS THAT CONNECT TO FAT AND TO THEREBY STIMULATE MORE FAT MOBILIZATION IN OXIDATION IS THROUGH MOVEMENT BUT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT EXERCISE THE TYPE OF MOVEMENT THAT I'M REFERRING TO IS EXTREMELY SUBTLE AND SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS TYPE OF MOVEMENT BUT I'M GUESSING YOUR PROBABLY NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU WHICH IS THAT SHIVER OR SHIVERING IS A STRONG STIMULUS FOR THE RELEASE OF A DRENALINE EPINEPRAN INTO FAT AND THE INCREASE IN FAT OXIDATION AND MOBILIZATION BUT SHIVER IS NOT JUST INDUCED BY COLD AND THERE ARE OTHER SUBTLE FORMS OF MOVEMENT THAT CAN GREATLY INCREASE FAT MATABOLISM AND FAT LOSS THERE WAS A GROUP IN ENGLAN DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES THAT DISCOVERED A PATHWAY BY WHICH SUBTLE FORMS OF MOVEMENT CAN GREATLY INCREASE FAT LOSS THIS IS THE WORK OF ROTHWELL AND STOCK IT'S VERY FAMOUS IN THE THERMOGENESISTS LITERATURE AND I LEARNED ABOUT THIS EARLY ON WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE AND I ASKED HOW DID THEY COME ACROSS THIS AND HERE'S HOW THE STORY GOES THEY WERE AWARE THAT SOME PEOPLE OVER EAT AND YET DON'T PUT ON WEIGHT OTHER PEOPLE OVEREAT EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEY SEEM TO ACCUMULATE EXTRA ATAPOST TISSUE NOW THIS IS LONG BEFORE ALL THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MICROBIOM AND HORMONE FACTORS IN AN YOU KNOW AS LON BEFOR IT MANY OF THE HORMONE FACTORS BESIDES INSOLENITY EVEN BEEN DISCOVERED WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY EXAMINED PEOPLE WHO OVEREIGHT AND DID NOT GAIN WEIGHT AND WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS THAT THOSE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN LOTS OF SUBTLE MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN OTHER WORDS THEY WERE FIDGETORS THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THEM I'M NOT GOINGO DO THE BRIDGIS THE BRITISH ACCENT VERSION OF FIDGETORS BUT ROTHWEN STOCK WERE BRITISH WHAT THEY FOUND WERE PEOPLE THAT OVEREAT BUT DON'T GAIN WEIGHT AS A CONSEQUENTS AND IN FACT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAD LOW LEVELS OF BODY FAT HAD A LOT OF RESTING TREMOR NOT OF THE PARKANSONIAN TYPE BUT THEY WOULD BOUNCE THEIR KNEE WHILE THEY WERE SITTING WHEN THEY WOULD TALK THEY WOULD ENGAGE IN VERY ANGULAR MOVEMENTS THEY WERE SORT OF ELECTRIC IN FACT THAT NOW IN SCIENCE I'VE WAS CHUCKLING ABOUT THIS AS I WAS DIVING BACK INTO THIS LITERATURE BECAUSE THE OTHER DAY I HEARD A A WONDERFUL LECTURE ON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TOPIC FROM A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WE ALL ADORE HIM  HE'S OVER IN EUROPE AND HE'S THIS TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL SCIENTIST THA WE LIKE TO POKE FUN AT HIM A AND EVERY ONE OF HIS MOVEMENTS IS INCREDIBLY ELECTRIC AND STACATO AND HE'S RAIL THIN AND HE EATS LIKE A HORSE AND SO FITS VERY WELL INTO THE DISCOVERY OF ROTHWELL AND STOCK WHO DISCOVERED THAT FIDGETORS PEOPLE THAT BOUNCE THEIR KNEE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A HEAD BOB WHILE THEY'RE LISTENING PEOPLE THAT NOT A LOT PEOPLE THAT STAND UP AND SIT DOWN A LOT THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND PEOPLE THAT PACE BURN ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALLORIES MORE THEN THE EXPRET THE CONTROL GROUP IN THE EXPERIMENTS THAT THEY LOOKED AT AND INDEED THERE'S BEEN A MODERN LOOK INTO ALL THIS AND THESE NUMBERS CHECK OUT THAT SIMPLY MOVING AROUND A LOT EVEN IF THOSE ARE SUBTLE MOVEMENTS GREATLY INCREASEIS THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT YOU BURN AND PEOPLE WHO OVEREAT THE PEOPLE WHO CAN HAVE THE THE SECOND OR THE THIRD DON'T UTTER DON'T LETS AT ALL AND DON'T SEEM TO PUT ON WEIGHT TO THE SAME DEGREE THEY ARE PEOPLE THAT MOVE AROUND A LOT EVEN WHEN SEATED THEIRE PEOPLE THAT WILL OFTEN MOVE THEIR LIMBS VERY QUICKLY AS WELL THAT THERE RE EVEN HAVE BEEN STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED OTHER THINGS THAT CORRELATE WITH FIDGETORS FIDGETORS STAND UP VERY QUICKLY AT THE END OF ELECTURE OR THEY STRIE TO GATHER THE THINGS VERY QUICKLY WERE AS N ON FIDGETORS DON'T SO DOGS LIKE MY BLE DOG COSTELLO DEFILLY NOT A FIDGETOR EVERY MOVEMENT IS INCREDIBLY SLOW AND DELIBERATE SITTING DOWN AS A PROCESS OF YASCUM TO SIT DOWN IN SORT OF A SLOW MOTION HEASCUM TOS GET UP IN YO CAN LOOKS AT USE SIZE AND STANDS UP THE FIDGETORS OF THE OPPOSITE THAT RIGHT YOU SAY HOWRY DOING ITHEY GO GRASO EVEN SOMETIMES THEIR SPEECH WILL BE EXCELERATED ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS BUT STACATO MOVEMENTS FIDGETING ET CETERA AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND AGAIN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THER'RE BEEN STUDIES THAT IT BEEN HAVE EXPLORED THIS USING SOME MODERN METABOLIC TRACKING AND INDEED SIMPLY MOVING A LOT BEING A FIDGETOR BOUNCING YOUR NEE STANDING UP AND PACING SEVERAL TIMES OR MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY LED TO CONSIDERABLE MOUNCE OF FAT LOSS AND WEIGHT LOST WHEN PEOPLE WERE INJESTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF FOOD IF THEY OVERRAITE THEY WERE ABLE TO COMPENSATE AND BURN OFF THAT FOOD AND IF THEY WERE TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT AND THEY INCORPORATED THIS FIDGETING PROTOCOL OF DELIBERATELY TRYING TO FIDGET MORE AND MOVE AROUND DURING THE DAY PACE STAND UP MORE QUICKLY SIT DOWN MORE OFTEN SIT DOWN AND STAND UP MORE OFTEN RATHER THEY FOUND THAT THEY GREATLY INCREASE THEIR WEIGHT LOSS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT INCREASES IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW THERRE THE ALWAYS THOSE FEW PEOPLE WHO BURNED A LOT MORE IT SEEMS TO WORK BEST IN PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLREADY SLIGHTLY OVER WEIGHT SO FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE OVER WEIGHT WHO ARE KIND OF RAVERSE TO EXERCISE FIDGETING MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A GOOD ENTRY POINT AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALORIES IS A CONSIDERABLE MOUNT OF CALERIES WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOT IT NOW WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS WELL THERE'S CLEARLY A TOOL TO EXPORT FROM THIS WHICH IS THAT YOU CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES BURNED WITHOUT HAVING TO GO ON ADDITIONAL LONG RUNS I DO HOPE THAT PEOPLE ARE EXERCISING REGULARLY BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR OTHER ASPECTS OF BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH BUT NONE THE LESS WE ALL WE ARE ALL TIME LIMITED AND WE ARE NOT ALL SO READY TO EMBRACE EXERCISE I HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAS BEEN SLOWLY COAXED INTO EXERCISE BUT IF I WERE TO TELL HER FOR INSTANCE YOU NEED A FIDGET MORE SHOULD PROBABLY GO FOR IT SO THIS IS A POWERFUL WAY TO INCREASE THE CALLORIES THAT ARE BURNED NOW THAT'S GREAT AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THE PROTOCOLS BUT I WANT TO NEST THAT PROTOCAL IN WHAT I SAID BEFORE WHICH IS THAT FAT IIS CONTROLLED BY THESE NURONS AND THE EPINEPHRON THEY RELEASE YOU MIGHT SAY WELL HOW COULD THESE LITTLE MICRO MOVEMENTS LEAD TO SO MUCH COLORIC BURN AND THAT'S WHERE IT REALLY GETS INTERESTING ROTHWELL AND STOCK AND OTHERS THAT THEY WORKED WITH SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND THAT THESE LITTLE FIDGETY MOVEMENTS THE ENGAGEMENT OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR MOSCULATURE THAT ARE NOTHING LIKE EXERCISE IT'S NOT THESE LARGE CORDINATED OR RHYTHMIC A BODY MOVEMENTS BUT RATHER ODLE LITTLE BITS OF FIDGETY MOVEMENT AND HERE I AM DOING A LOT OF FIDGETY MOVEMENT AS AN EXAMPLE TAPPING THE PEN THIS KIND OF THING THERE I WAS PROBABLY THAT KITTING CLASS MOST OF THE TIME LIKE I TRY NOT TO DO IT TO IRRITATE YOU WHAT I WAS DEAFNLY A NEA BOUNCSER UM I'M NOT PARTICULARLY LEAN OR OR NOT BUT UM YOU KNOW AIS DEFINALLY THIS IS A A COMMON ACTIVITY FOR MEAT PEOPLE THAT DO THAT SORT OF THING IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S NOT THE KIND OF COLORIC BURN THAT WE NORMALLY THINK OF OF LIKE OH YOUR RUNNING LIFTING WEIGHT SWIMMING YOGA ET CETERA THOSE SUBTLE MOVEMENTS OF OUR CORE MUSCULATURE NOT JUST THE CORE BUT ALL OUR LIMBS AND ARE IN OUR MUSCULATURE THOSE LOW LEVEL MOVEMENTS THEY TRIGGER APINAFERAN RELEASE FROM THESE NURONS AND THEY STIMULATE THE MOBILIZATION OF FAT AND THEN THAT FAT IS OXIDIZED AT HIGHER RATES AND I FIND THIS FASCINATING I WISH MORE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT IT WHICH IS WHAT I'M TELLING YOU ABOUT IT TODAY THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EXERCISE IN THE TRADITIONAL FORM AND YET EIGHT HUNDRED OR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALLORIES PER DAY THAT'S A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FAT OXIDIZED IF YOU ARE IN A CALORY MAINTENANCE MODE OR A IF YOU'R SUB COLORIC THAT'S GOING TO ADD TO STILL ADDITIONAL FAT LOSS THE DATE ON THIS ARE TREMENDOUS I'LL LINK TO A FEW STUDIES IF YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT WHAT'S CALLED NEAT AN E A T WHICH IS NON EXERCISE ACTIVITY THERMOGENESIS NEAT SO WHAT'S THE PROTOCAL FIDGET IF YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN BURNING CALLORIES AND YOU ALREADY EXERCISE YOU WANT TO BURN MORE OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY EXERCISE OR YOUR RAVERSED EXERCISE FOR WHATEVER REASON FIDGETING MOVEMENTS STACADO MOVEMENT STANDING UP WALKING AROUND PACING ALL THE SORT OF NERVOUS ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE SO CRITICAL OF AND OTHER PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES IN OURSELVES ARE ACTUALLY MOBILIZING AND OXIDISEING A LOT OF FAT AND A LOT OF ENERGY AND WHILE THIS PROBABLY WON'T COMPENSATE FOR CHRONIC OVER EATING THE COLORIC BURN FROM THIS IS CONSIDERABLE AND VERY LIKELY KIN OFFSET A YOU KNOW A MEAL THAT HAD EXCESSIVE CALORIES OR A KOND OF STEADY STATE OF ACCUMULE OF EATING TOO MUCH AND IT ALSO STARS TO OPEN UP ALL SORTS OF THOUGHTS AN DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU WHEN YOU TRAVEL YOU TEND TO EAT FOODS THAT ARE AND OF OUTSIDE YOUR YOUR NORMAL ONES WE TEND TO EAT O YOU FOODS THAT AREN'T SO GREAT FOR US WE ALSO TEND TO BE A WILL BIT MORE SEDENTARY WHEN WE TRAVEL WERE ON THE PLAN ET CETERA BUT ALL OF THAT ASIDE JUST THE USE OF SOMETHING LIKE LOW LEVEL MOVEMENT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A TREMOR BUT ALSO THESE SELECT SHORT SMALL FIDGETY MOVEMENTS I'M INTENTINALLY DOING A LOT OF THESE TODAY YOU HAVE EXAMPLES THAT YOU CAN USE THAT TO SELECT FROM IF YOU LIKE THESE CAN HAVE A MAJOR OF FECT ON FAT LOSS AND IT RAISES A SECOND TOOL IF THESE LOW MEANING THESE SMALL MOVEMENTS THAT WE ENGAGE GIN TRIGGER EPINEPERAN A DRENALINE RELEASE FROM THESE NURONS OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOSYSTM THAT ENERVATE FAT AND INCREASE FAT MOBILIZATION OXIDISSUE NOW IT SHOULD MAKE SENSE WHY SHIVERING IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST STIMULUS STIMULY THAT ONE CAN IN CORPORATE TO STIMULATE FAT LOSS NOW SHIVERING IS ALMOST ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH COLD WE THINK SHIVERING WE THINK COLD BECAUSE WHEN WE GET COLD WE SHIVER AND THERE ARE TWO WAYS THAT SHIVERING CAN INCREASE FAT LOSS AND THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THAT YOU CAN USE SHIVERING YOU CAN LEVERAGE SHIVERING AND YOU CAN LEVERAGE COLD TO EXCELERATE FAT LOSS BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT CORRECTLY AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE USING COLD AND FRANKLY SUGGESTING COLD AS A MEANS TO INCREASE METABOLISM FAT LOSS ARE SUGGESTING THE EXACT WRONG PROTOCOL IN FACT THAT ONE I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND IS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THE TYPICAL PROTOCAL THAT YOU'D HEREABOUT SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE COLD AND HAW A LEVERAGE SHIVER AS A PARTICULARLY STRONG STIMULUS TO INCREASE FAT LOSS MOE THROUGH MOBILIZATION AND OXIDATION OF THESE FATIACIDS SO IN RECENT YEARS THAS BEEN A GROWING INTEREST IN THE USE OF COLD FOR VARIOUST THINGS LIKE IMPROVING STRESS TOLERANCE IMPROVING METABOLISM RECOVERY FROM EXERCISE I'VE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF THOSE THINGS IND THE USES OF COLD ON THIS PODCAST IN FACT DID IN EPISODE ON HOW TO SUPERCHARGE PERFORMANCE THROUGH PALMER COOLING COOLING THE PALMS IN SPECIFIC WAYS OR THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEET AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT AND HOW TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH YOU CAN CHECK OUT THAT EPISODE BUT MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE USING COLD EXPOSURE TYPICALLY BY TAKING COLD SHOWERS OR BY GETTING INTO COLD WATER OF SOME OTHER KIND A LAY OR A RIVER OR COLD BATH OR AN ICE FATH AND THEY ARE DOING THAT PROBABLY WITH MIXED GOALS MEANING THEY ARE BOTH WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE THEIR METABOLISM AND BURNED FAT AS WELL AS IMPROVE MENTAL RASILIENTS SINCE TO DAY WERE TALKING ABOUT ACCELERATING FAT LOSS THROUGH THE USE OF SCIENCE PASE TOOLS ONE EMPHASIZE A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NATURE JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO SHOWING EXACTLY HOW COLD INCREASES METABOLISM AND FAT LOSS SO WE HAVE SEVERAL KINDS OF FAT THREE KINDS IN FAT WE HAVE WHITE FAT WHITE ATAPOST TISSUE AND WE HAVE BROWN FAT OR BROWN ATAPOST TISSUE AND THERE'S A THIRD KIND WHICH IS BAGE ATAPOST TISSUE WHITE FAT IS THE TYPE THAT WE TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AS FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT AND IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY RICH IN MITOCHONDRIA IT IS THERE AS AN ENERGY STORAGE SIGHT AND WE HAVE TO MOBILIZE THE FAT OUT AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND BURN IT P ELSEWHERE BROWN FAT LARGELY EXISTS BETWEEN OUR SHOULDER BLADES AND ON THE BACK OF OUR NECK BETWEEN THE SCAPULA AND IT'S RICH WITH MITACHONDREA WHICH IS WHY IT'S CALLED BROWN FAT AND BROWN FAT HAS A PARTICULAR BI CHEMICAL CASCADE WHEREBY IT CAN TAKE FOOD ENERGY AND CAN IT CAN TAKE FOOD BASICALLY BREAK IT DOWN AND CONVERT IT INTO ENERGY WITHIN THOSE CELLS UNDER SOME ADDITIONAL STEPS INVOLVED BUT UNLIKE FATTY ACIDS FROM WHITE FAT WHICH HAVE TO TRAVEL ELSEWHERE GET BROKEN DOWN AND MITO CONDREAN AND CONVERTENTATY PEA ET CETERA USE BY THE MITOCONDREA RATHER BROWN FAT IS THERMOGENIC IT CAN ACTUALLY USE ENERGY DIRECTLY IT SKIPS A STEP AND I DON'T WANT TO GET DIVERTED BY GOING INTO ALL THE THE BOU CHEMISTRY OF IT BASE FAT IS SORT OF IM BETWEEN IT'S WHITE FAT THAT COULD BE BROWN FAT BECAUSE IT HAS SOME MITOCHONDRIA IN IT BUT NOT AS MANY AS BROWN FAT NOW COLD EXPOSURE DOES SEVERAL THINGS MAKING OURSELVES COLD CAND ALLOW US TO BUILD UP MENTAL RAZILIENTS BECAUSE GETTING INTO COLD OF ANY KIND DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A CRIO CHAMBER DOESN'T MATTER FITS A COLD DAY AND YOU FORGOT YOUR SWEATER YOUR PARKA IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S AN ICE BATH OR YOU YOU'RE LYING DOWN IN THE SNOW COLD CAUSES THE RELEASE OF A DRENOLIN FROM YOUR DRENALS AND IT CAUSES THE RELEASE OF EPINEPHERAN FROM THESE NURONS THAT CONNECT TO FAT NOW THE BIG EFFACTS OF COLD ON METABOLISM AND FAT BURNING ARE GOING TO BE THROUGH TWO ROUTS ONE IS THAT IF YOU EXPOSE YOURSELF TO COLD YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRIGGER ACTIVATION OF BROWN FAT AS WELL AS TO CONVERT MORE BASH FAT INTO TRUE BROWN FAT SO YOU ESSENTIALLY CREAT A STRONGER OR HOTTER FURNACE THAT'S THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT BROWN FATS LIKE A FURNACE AND SO WITH THIS PRINCIPLE THAT WE STARTED WITH A CALORIES IN VERSES CALORIES BURN WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOUR INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF BURNING YOU'RE INCREASING THE BURN OF ENERGY BY INCREASING THE INTENSITY OF THE HEAT INSIDE YOU SO TO SPEAK OKI A TALKING HERES KIND OF METAPHORICALLY NOW HOW CAN YOU DO THAT WELL IF YOU GET INTO COLD WATER OR AN ICE BATH OR A COLD DAY AND YOU TRY AND REMAIN CALM AND RESIST SHIVERING YOU ACTUALLY SHORT CIRCUIT THIS MECHANISM FOR INCREASING BROWN FAT THORMAGENISIS THE PAPER PUBLISH IN NATURE SHOWS THAT IT IS SHIVERING ITSELF THAT CAUSES THE BROWN FAT TO INCREASE YOUR BURNING YOUR BURN RITE AND YOUR METABOLISM AND IT WORKS LIKE THIS WHEN YOU GET INTO COLD AND YOU SHIVER THE SHIVERING THOSE THAT LOW LEVEL MOVEMENT OF THE MOSCLE THOUGH SMALL MOVEMENTS TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF A MOLECUILL COLD SUCINATE S U C C I N  T E SUCINATE AND SUCINATE ACTS ON THE BROWN FAT TO INCREASE BROWN FAT THERMAGENESIS AND FAT BURNING OVER ALL IT ACTUALLY INCREASES BODY HEAT THROUGH THIS BROWN FAT THERGMAGENESIS PATHWAY AND IT ALSO OVER TIME CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BROWN FAT BY CONVERTING BASH FAT INTO TRUE BROWN FAT NOW HOW MUCH COLD EXPOSURE AND HOW OFTEN THAT'S THE KEY BUT BE FOUR I GIVE THAT DETAIL OR SET OF DETAILS REMEMBER IF YOU RESIST THE SHIVER YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE INCREASED METABOLIC OF FACT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE SUCINATE RELEASE SO IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR BODY HEAT YOUR THERMOGENIC LEVEL TO GO UP YOU NEED TO SHIVER SO NOW WE HAVE THE NEAT THAT NON EXERCISE ACTIVITY THROUG MAGENESIS OF LOW LEVELS OF ACTIVITY AS I DESCRIBE BEFORE WHICH ARE DONE AWAY FROM COLD MAY YOU DO THEM IN COLD AS WELL AS WELL AS SHIVER IN RESPONSE TO COLD AND SO THE SHIVER ITSELF IS VALUABLE FOR TRIGGERING THE RELEASE OF SUCINATE IN FACT SUCINATE IS BEING EVOLVED NOW BY VARIOUS DRUG MANUFACTURES AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR OBESITY ALTHOUGH IT HASN'T REALLY HIT THE MARKET IN ITS IN FINAL FORM YET SUCINTE IS POWERFUL FOR ITS EFFECTS ON BROWN FAT SO HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK DO YOU NEED TO EXPOSE YOURSELF TO COLD WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH FAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LOSE AND HOW MUCH YOU'RE TRYING TO INCREASE YOUR METABOLISM THERE ARE STUDIES THAT DESCRIBE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON FAT LOSS OF EXPOSING YOURSELF TO COLD EITHER THROUGH COLD SHOWER OR THROUGH ICE BATH OR OTHER COLD WATER DOESN'T HAVE TO ACTIAY HAVE ICE IN IT PROVIDED ITS COLD ENOUGH FOR ANY TIME ANYWHERE SCUSE ME BETWEEN ONE AND FIVE TIMES PER WEAK BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT JUST ONE EXPOSURE PER WEAK CAN BE VALUABLE THE QUESTION THEN IS HOW LONG TO GET INTO THAT COLD ENVIRONMENT AND HOW COLD SHOULD THAT ENVIRONMENT BE SO FIRST THESS TALK ABOUT HOW LONG TO GET INTO THAT COLD ENVIRONMENT THE ANSWER HERE MIHT BE A LOBIT DIFFERENT THEN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE MOST OF YOU MIGHT THINK OH WELL IF ONE MINUTE IS GOOD THREE MINUTES IS BETTER AND IF THREE MINUTES IS BETTER THAN TEN MINUTES IS BEST BUT REMEMBER THE GOAL IS TO GET THE SHIVER INDUCE RELEASE OF SUCINATE SO THAT SUCINATE CAN TRIGGER THE BROWN FAT IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU WANT TO TRIGGER THE SHIVER WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TO GET INTO THE COLD AND THEN GET OUT OF THE COLD AND TYPICALLY NOT DRY OFF AND THEN GET BACK INTO THE COLD AND OUT OF THE COLD THAT WILL DEFINITELY STIMULATE MORE SHIVERING THAN JUST GETTING INTO THE COLD ITSELF SO WHAT I'M NOT REFERRING TO IS GETTING INTO THE COLD ENVIRONMENT LIKE AN ICE BAT AND WAITING UNTILL YOU SHIVER AND STAYING THEIRE SHIVERING OKI YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO GET HYPOTHERMIC AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR R YOU WANT A  YOU AN TO GET APPROVAL FROM YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE YOU DO ANY OF THIS WHEN YOU GET IN TO COLD WATER THEY'RE TWO FACTORS THAT WILL DICTATE WHETHER NOT YOU SHIVER PROBABLY THREE BUT LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THE MAIN TO ONE IS HOW COLD IT IS SO HOW COLD SHOULD IT BE AND LOOK IF YOU GET INTO WATER THAT'S VERY VERY COLD IT CAN ACTUALY SHOCK YOUR HEART IT CAN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A HARD ATTACK OF IT'S TRULY TRULY ICE COLD AND YOU'RE NOT ADAPTED TO THAT SO PROCEED WITH CAUTION PLEASE I'M NOT A PHYSICIAN AND I'M NOT I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYONE GET HURT COLD JUST COLD ENOUGH TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE IS A GOOD PLACE TO START SO FOR SOME OF YOU THAT'S GOING TO BE  SIXTY DEGREES FOR SOME OF YOU THAT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY FIVE DEGREES FOR SOME OF YOU IT'S GOING TO BE HIGH THIRTIES RIGHT DEPENDS ON HOW COLD ADAPTED YOU ARE AND PEOPLE VERY IN TERMS OF HOW WELL THEY TOLERATE THE COLD SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS FIND A TEMPERATURE THAT YOU CAN GET IN TO ONE TO FIVE PROBABLY ONE TO THREE TIMES A WEEK IF YOU REALLY WANT THIS TO EXCELERATE FAT LOSS AND YOU WANT TO GET IN UNTIL YOU JUST START TO SHIVER AND THEN YOU WANT TO GET OUT AND NOT DRY OFF WAIT ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE MINUTES AND THEY GET BACK INTO THE COLD NOW YOU'LL NOTICE WHEN YOU GET BACK INTO THE COLD IT'LL ALMOST SEEM SOOTHING IT MIGHT ACTUALLY NOT INDUCE SHIVE YOU MIGHT TAKE AWAY THE SHIVER THAT YOU  THAT YOU HAD SO HERE'S A POTENTIAL KIND OF SETS REPS PROTOCALL THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH FIND A TEMPERATURE THEN DUCE TO SHIVER FOR YOU THAT'S GOING TO VERY DEPENDING ON YOUR COLD TOLERANCE AND HOW COLD ADAPTED YOU ARE ONE TO THREE MAY BE FIVE TIMES A WEEK GET IN UNTIL YOU OR GET UNDER THE SHOWER WHATEVER IT IS UNTIL YOU START TO SHIVER GENUINELY SHIVER THEN AFTER ABOUT A MINUR SO GET OUT SPEND ONE TO THREE MINUTES OUT BUT DON'T DRY OFF GET BACK IN FOR ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE MINUTES BUT TRY IN ACCESS THE SHIVER POINT AGAIN AND YOU MIGHT DO THREE REPETITIONS OF THAT SO IT'S THREE TIMES IN AND THREE TIMES OUT CODAL  THAT'S A GREAT STARTING PLACE EN WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS BUILD UP YOUR TOLERANCE O TO COLD SO FAST THAT PRETTY SOON YOU'RE ABLE TO RESIST THE SHIVER BECAUSE O REMEMBER THE SHIVER IS THE SOURCE OF THE SUCANNATE RELEASE THAT WILL TRIGER BROWN FAT THORM AGENESIS SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THIS PROTOCAL SPELLED OUT YOU CAN ACCESS IT ZERO COST AT A WEB SITE WHICH IS THE COLD PLUNGE DOT CALM THE COLD PLUNGE IS A COMPANY THEY MAKE COLD PLUNGES AND THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH TO GIFT ONE TO THE HUVERMAN LAB PODCAST BUT I WANT EMPHASIZE THAT THESE PROTOCALS ARE FREE OF COST THE FOKS AT THE COLD PLUNGE ARE NOT JUST INTERESTED IN A MARKETING THEIR PRODUCT BUT ONT OF THEIR MAIN INTERESTS IS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO ENGAGING COLD EXPOSURE FOR PARTICULAR EN POINTS AND GOALS LIKE FAT LOST RESILIENTS ET CETERA RESISTING INFLAMMATION BUT THEIRE MAIN FOCUS IS PROVIDING PEOPLE PROTOCALS AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE COLD EXPOSURE O VARIOUS KINDS NOT JUST THROUGH THEIR PRODUCTS BUT THROUGH COLD RIVERS AND I'M JUMPS IN THE OCEAN AND THINGS THAT COLD SHOWERS WHATEVER IS A MOST CONVENIENT AND ACCESSIBL FOR VARIOUS PEOPLE AND SO WE NEED IT A PLACE WHERE WE COULD HOUSE THESE PROTOCOLS IN A PERMANENT WAY AND NOT JUST FOR THIS EPISODE BUT SO WHAT THEY'VE AGREED TO DO IS TO POST THE PROTOCOLS THERE THEY SHOULD BE VERY EASY TO FIND ON THEIR WEBSITE THIS PARTICULAR PROTOCAL WE'RE REFERRING TO AS THE FAT LOSS OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL FOR LACK OF A BETTER NAME AND IT'S REALLY GROUNDED IN HOW COLD CAN BE USED TO INDUCE SHIVER AND AGAIN IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW YOURE ACCESSING THAT COLD PROVIDED YOU ACCESS THE SHIVER AND YOU'RE MOVING FROM THE COLD ENVIRONMENT TO A SLIGHTLY WARMER ENVIRONMENT SO GETTING OUT OF THE COLD SHOUER GETTING OUT OF THE ICE BATH ET CETERA OR OUT OF THE COLD PLUNGE AND THEN BACK IN BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE COOLING AND REWARMING PROCESS OF THE BODY IS WHERE SHIVER KICKS IN AND SO THAT'S DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT THAN JUST TRING TO GET IN TO THE COLD AND STAY IN THE COLD FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND IF YOU ZUMOUT A LITTLE BIT AND THINK ABOUT SOME EXAMPLES IN LIFE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY THAT MUST BE THE CASE FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE WHO DO A LOT OF COLD WATER SWIMS YOU AVE THESE POLAR BARE CLUBS I THINK THEY CALL THEMSELVES DO THESE COLD WATER SWIMS I WOULD SOMETIMES SEE THESE PEOPLE SWIMMING BACK AND FORTH ALCATRAS ANDSTELF LIKE THAT WHICH IT SEEMS RISKY AND YOU KNOW THEY TELL ME IS VERY STIMULATING FOR THE MINE AND BODY GREAT SOMETIMES THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY LEAN OFTENTIMES THE'RE NOT AND THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF COLD EXPOSURE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS AS IF YOU EXPOSE YOURSELF TO COLD OVER AND OVER YOU ADAPT YOU BECOME COLD ADAPTED AND WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU NO LONGER GET THE EPINEPRAN THE ADRENOLIN RELEASE FROM THE COLD AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T GET THE SUCANATE RELEASE AND THE SHIVERING AND THE BROWN FAT THERMAGENIC EFFECT QUITE AS INTENSELY SO IF YOU WANT TO USE COLD FOR OTHER REASONS IT CERTAINLY COLD WATER SWIMS CAN BE FUN OM AND THERE'S A YOU KNOW LONGS YOU CAN DO HIM SAFELY THE THEIR GREAT I'VE DONE GOTTEN INTO COLD WATER SWIMMING FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME AH YOU CAN USE COLD FOR RAZILIENE ET CETERA BUT IF YOU WANT TO USE COLD TO INCREASE FAT LOSS THAND GETTING THIS SHIVER PROCESS GOING THE COOLING AND REWARMING WHICH ACCELERATES THE AMOUNT OR INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF SHIVER THAT'S GOING TO BE THE WAY TO GO ONE NOTE ABOUT COLD AND SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT IT RELEASES A FEW YEARS BACK THERE WAS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THIS HORMON COLLED IRICEN I R I S I N WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH COLD AD THEREWAS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL ROLL IN INCREASING MATABOLISM SO MUCH SO THAT PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO EXPLORE THIS AS A POTENTIAL FAT LOSS DRUG TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT WENT NOWHERE THE SCIENCE OVENTUALLY SHIFTED OVER TO SUCANATE AS THE MAIN FACTOR IN COLD INDUCED THERMAGENISIS THROUGH THIS BROWN FAT PATHWAY BUT IF ANY ONE OUT THERE IS AWARE OF ANY POUSIVE EFFECTS OF ARICEN OR YOU KNOW OF ANY SCIENCE OF A RISEN THAT I'M OVER LOOKING HERE OR THAT I'M SPEAKING BOUT INCORRECTLY PLEASE LET ME KNOW I'D BE VERY CURIOUS TO LEARN NOW I WANTO JUST TALK ABOUT BROWN FAT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND TALK ABOUT A PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE IN WHICH YOU WERE RICH WITH BROWN FAT YOU HAD A TONA BROWN FAT AND THAT'S WHEN YOU WERE A BABY BABIES CAN'T SHIVER THESE NURONS THAT RELEASE EPINEFERON INTO FAT ARE NOT WIRED UP AND REALLY AREN'T PRESENT AT SUFFICIENT LEVELS OR IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS WHEN YOU ARE A BABY AND THEREFORE YOU CAN'T SHIVER AS A BABY AND YOU CAN'T WARM YOURSELF UP IN COLD ENVIRONMENTS VERY WELL TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT MOTHER NATURE INSTALLED IN ALL OF US AN EXCESS OF BROWN FAT EARLY IN LIFE THAT EXISTS AGAIN IN THE UPPER BACK AN THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK AND THE BACK ON THE NECK OVER TIME IF WE DON'T EXPOSE OURSELVES TO COLD ENVIRONMENTS OR DO OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE A SHIVER WE LOSE A LOT OF THAT BROWN FAT BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT BROWN FAT IS THAT THERE SOME EVIDENCE THAT BROWN FAT JUST LIKE WHITE FAT CAN BOTH INCREASE IN SIZE BUT THAT YOU CAN ALSO ADD NEW SELLS OTHER'S A LITTLE BUT CONTROVERSIAL PEOPLE I SAY YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE NUMBER OF FAT CELLS YOU CAN JUST SHRINK THEM OR INCREASE THEIR SIZE WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT EPINEFERAND RELEASED FROM THESE LITTLE NERVE ENDINGS IN BROWN FAT AND SUCANATE CIRCULATING IN THE BODY MAY AND A ONE UNDER SCORE MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF BROWN FAT CELLS PROBABLY BY CONVERTING THESE BACHE FAT CELLS INTO BROWN FAT SO THAT ALLOWS US TO BECOME MUCH AS WE WERE EARLY IN LIFE WHERE WE METABOLIZED LIKE CRAZY AND WE'D HEAT OURSELVES UP WITHOUT SHIVERING SOME PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THE COLD THING TO THE EXTREME YOUON PUTTING ICE PACKS ON THE BACK OF THEIR NECK THROUGHOUT THE DAY A DID A EPISODE ALL ABOUT TESTASTRONE AND ESTERGEN AND THERES THIS A LET'S JUST CALL IT A A VERY NICHE AI HAFTO IMAGINE VERY VERY NICHE CULTURE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AM WEARING LITERALLY I'M NOT JOKING THEY RE THESE A COOL PACK ICE PACK UNDER PANTS THEY GO BY A NAME THAT I'M NOT CAN REPEAT ON HERE BUT YOU CAN FIND THEM ON AMAZON THAT'S A THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE USING COLD FACTS ON THE BODY AND ON THE GROWING TO TRY AND INCREASE THINGS LIKE TESTOSTRONE AH BUT AS WELL TO TRY ND INCREASE THERMOGENESIS AND TRYING TO INCREASE THEIR METABOLISM JUST REMEMBER IF YOU BECOME COLD ADAPTED YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE FAT BURNING EFFACTS TO THE SAME DEGREE SO COLD AS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR FAT LOSS BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO ADAPT THIS IS REMINISCENT OF A RULE THAT YOU HEREABOUT IN ENDURANCE EXERCISE AND INSTRENGTH EXERCISE AS WELL WHICH IS THAT YOU WANT TO USE THE MINIMAL EFFECTIVE STIMULUS TO PROMOTE GROWTH OR PROGRESS O GROWTH OF THE MUSCLE OR INPROVEMENTS IN ENDURANCE IF YOU GO TEN PER CENT FURTHER ON A RUN OR YOU KNOW TEN PER CENT FASTER YOU WILL LIKELY SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE PROVIDED YOU RECOVERY THEN EXT TIME YOU COME BACK AND DO THAT SAME ROUND OF EXERCISE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO MORE WORK OR COMPLETE THE WORK MORE EASILY ET CETERA YOU'VE ADAPTED IF YOU DO TWENTY PER CENT MORE DISTANCE OR TWENTY PER CENT MORE WEIGHT YOU WON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE SAME COMMISURATE LEVEL OF GAIN OR IMPROVEMENT AND SO LIKEWISE WITH COLD IF YOURE QUICKLY MOVING FROM THIRTY SECONDS OF EXPOSURE TO TEN MINUTES OF EXPOSURE YOU'RE OVERLOOKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE MOST FAT LOSS AND INCREASE IN METABOLISM BY STEPPING IT UP IN SMALLER INCREMENTS OOK IAND THIS ALSO SPEAKS TO THE RATIONAL FOR USING COLD EXPOSURE TO ECCELERATE FAT LOSS FOR CERTAIN PERIODS BUT THEN MAYBE NOT DOING IT YEAR ROUND IF FAT LOSS IS YOUR GOAL MAYBE USE IT FOR TWO THREE MONTHS AT A TIME AND THEN STOP FOR TWO THREE MONTHS AT TIME BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A POTENT STIMULUS PROVIDED YOU ENGAGE IN THE IN THE SHIVER NEXT I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO EXERCISE AND HOW PARTICULAR TIMING AND TYPES OF EXERCISE CAN VASTLY IMPROVE FAT LOSS BEFORE I DO THAT I JUST WANT O MENTION A REALLY IMPORTANT REFERENCE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW NURANS CONNECT TO FAT THIS IS CERTAINLY A PAPER THAT YOU'D WANT TO LOOK AT IF YOUARE INTERESTED IN DIVING DEEP INTO THE LITERATURE AND READING ALL THE VARIOUS STUDIES IT'S A REVIEW AND THE TITLE OF THE REVIEW IS NURL INERVATION OF WHITE ATIPOST TISSUE AND THE CONTROL OF LI POLISIS THAT THE NURL INERVATION OF WHITE ATIPOST TISSUE AND THE CONTROL OF LIE POLISIS IT WAS PUBLISHE IN FRONTIERS IN NURO ANDER CHRONOLOGY YOU CAN FIND THAT FREE ON LINE THAT HAVE THE FULL TEXT AVAILABLE THE FIRST AUTHOR IS A BARTNESS B A R T N E S S IT'S A GREAT REVIEW AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE MENTIONED IN THE REVIEW FOLLOW THE REFERENCES IN THAT REVIEW IN THE REFERENCE TRAIL AS WE SAY IF YOUR INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT ALSO HOW NURANS CONTROL BROWN FAT AND BEFORE I MOVE TO EXERCISE I ALSO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING THAT COMES UP EVERY FEW YEARS AND AS LARGELY BEEN CONSIDERED MYTH NOW BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY MORE INTERESTING THEN MOST PEOPLE MIGHT THINK WHICH IS THIS ISSUE OF SPOT REDUCTION KNOWING THAT EIGHTIES AND NINETIES THERE WAS A THERE WERE A LOT OF COMMERCIALS LIKTE I INFOMERCIALS A WHERE THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT SPOT REDUCTION YOU KNOW IF YOU DO SIT UPS WILWILL YOU LOSE ABDOMINAL FAT IF YOU DO HIPRAISES OR GLUTE RAISA WE YOU LOSE GLUTE AND HIP FAT AND I THINK EVERYBODY NOW BELIEVES THAT AND UNDERSTANDS THAT FAT MATABOLISM IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS SYSTEMICALLY THROUGHOUT THE BODY THAT SOME BODY FAT IS COTINGQUOT MORE STUBBORN THAN OTHERS EVERYONE VARIES IN WHERE THEY TEND TO STORE FAT OR LOSE FAT LAST NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THAT IN INPARTICULAR HORMON RECEPTORS BUT NOW AT LEAST IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SPOT REDUCTION AND T APOSSIBILITY OF REAL TRUE SPOT REDUCTION REDUCTIONS IN FAT IN A TARGETED WAY OF BODY PART OR BODY AREA TARGETED WAY IS BECOMING MORE OF A REALITY AND MAY BE A REALITY SOON BECAUSE EXERCISE THAT TRIGGERS THE ACTIVATION OF THESE NERVE FIBERS THESE NURONS THAT INERVATE FAT IN THEORY IF YOU CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF EPINEPERAN RELEASE THAT THOSE PARTICULAR FAT PATS AS THEYRE CALLED THEIR ACTUALLY COLLN FAT PATS IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IN THEORY YOU COULD INCREASE MOBILIZATION FROM THOSE PARTICULAR BODY FAT SIGHTS OCASO BECAUSE THE NEW VIEW THAT THE MODERN UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S NOT A DRENALANE RELEASE SYSTEMICALLY KIND OF BATHING ALL YOUR FAT TISSUE BUT RATHER IT'S NURONS RELEASING A DRENALANE EPINEFERAN LOCALLY THAT IN THEORY EXERCISE THAT STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF EPINEFRAN OR EXERCISE COUPLED WITH THINGS LIKE SHIVER WERE LOW GRADE CHAKING MOVEMENT OR THESE THE NEAT THE THE NON EXERCISE ACTIVITY THERMOGENESIS COULD IN THEORY LEAD TO LOCAL ENHANCEMENT OF MOBILIZATION OF FAT TISSUE SO I THINK THAT SPOT REDUCTION ACTUALLY WILL SOON BE SOMETHING THAT'S POSSIBLE USING THE APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU NOW WHAT WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO FOR THIS WITH THIS INFORMATION NOW WELL I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE THE FACT THAT IF ONE IS GOING TO ENGAG IN EXERCISE THAT DOING EXERCISE THAT INVOLVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT BODY PARTS AND MOVEMENTS IS LIKELY TO ENCOURAGE THE MAINTENANCE AND OR GROWTH OF THESE NURONS THAT ENERVATE FAT THROUGHOUT THE BODY WHAT THIS MEANS IS CHANGING UP THE PATTERN OF EXERCISE ENGAGING IN NOVEL TYPES OF MOVEMENTS MAY ACTUALLY BE ONE WAY THAT ONE CAN ACCESS THESE SO CALLED STUBBORN BODY FAT PATS NOW THERE'S A LIBIT OF SPECULATION IN THE STATEMENT THAT IM MAKING BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT MAKES SENSE IF YOU BECOME VERY ADAPTED TO A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF EXERCISE WHETHER NOT YOUR SUBCOLORIC OR NOT YOUR A MAINTENANCE CALORIES OR NOT YOU ARE OXIDISING SOME FAT ALWAYS AND YOUR UTILIZING THE NURONS THAT INERVATE FAT IN A REGULAR WAY IN PRETTY SOON THIS INERVATION IS GOING TO SHUT OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NO REASON WHY THIS NERL INERVATION OF FAT SHOULD CONTINUE TO RELEASE EPINEPERAN UNLESS YOU GIVE IT A STRONG STIMULUS LIKE COLD OR THE FIDGETING OR IN THIS CASE TO DO NOVEL FORMS OF EXERCISE AND THERE'S SOME ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AN THERE IDONTI ONE TO CALL IT DATA BUT ANEDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE COTINCO STUBBORN BODY FAT IF THEY START TO ADOPT NEW PATTERNS OF EXERCISE THEY CAN START TO ACCESS THOSE STUBBORN FAT PATS AND AGAIN FAT PAS IS THE CORRECT WAY TO REFERRED THIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SO WHAT WERE FOCUSING ON TO DAY IS THE FACT THAT FACT INDEED WILL BE MOBILIZED IN OXIDIZE IN RESPONSE TO A DEFICIT IN CALORIES BUT THAT THE WAYTHAT INER ON'S CONTROL THOSE FAT PADS AND THOSE BODY FAT STORES AFFORD YOU A LOT MORE CONTROL THAN PERHAPS YOU EVER PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MOVEMENT AND THE MORE TRADITIONAL KINDS OF MOVEMENT ACH  EXERCISE THERE'S BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO INCREASES AN METABOLISM AND FAT LOSS TO GREATER DEGREES DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT FOR INSTANCE YOUR FASTED WHEN YOU DO IT OR NOT WHETHER NOT YOU DO YOUR CARDIO FIRST OR YOUR RESISTANCE TRAINING FIRST AND THIS IS AGAIN AND THE LITERATURE FOR WHICH THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY BUT IN DIGGING THROUGH ALL THE STUDIES ON ON THIS WERE FINALLY STRYING TO ARRIVE AT A CONCENSES OF WHEN IS BEST TO DO EXERCISE AND WHAT TYPES OF EXERCISE TO DO IF YOUR GOAL IS FAT LOSS THE TOPIC OF EXERCISE IS A KIND OF CONTROVERSIAL ONE NOT AS CONTROVERSAL AS NUTRITION AN DIET WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES BUT IT'S A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE DIFFERENTYPES OF EXERCISE INGAGE THE MUSCULATURE THE BODY IN THE HEART IN THE LONGS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND CAN HAVE VASTLY DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON THINGS LIKE HORMONES IN METABOLISM DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT IT'S OF HIGH INTENSITY MODERN ITENSITY OR LOW INTENSITY SO RATHER THAN THINK ABOUT WEIGHT TRAINING VERSES CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE I THINK THE MOST SIMPLE WAY THE MOST FLUID WAY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT EXERCISE AND FAT LOSS IS IN TERMS OF THREE GENERAL TYPES OF TRAINING WHETHER NOT S DONE WITH WEIGHTS OR BODY WEIGHT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AND THOSE ARE HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO GAIN A LOT OF POPULARITY IN RECENT YEARS SO CALL HIT H I I T SO HIGH INTENSILY INTERVAL TRAINING SPRINT INTERVAL TRAINING SO THAT'S CAN BE VERY HIGH INTENSITY OR ESI T OR MODERATE INTENSITY CONTINUOUS TRAINING AM I C T SO WE'VE GOT HIT CIT AND MICKED AM I C T AND WE CAN GET A LITTIBIT MORE PRERCISE IF YOU' LIKE A I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO MEASURES MY VIO TO MAX OR ANYTHING WHILE I EXERCISE I GENERALLY KNOW WHETHER NOT I'M DOING SOMETHING I COULD CONTINUE FOR A VERY LONG TIME OR WHETHER NOT I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT A I REALIZE THIS GOING TO BE OF SHORT DURATION HIGH INTENSITY BUT IF YOU LIKE TO MAP THIS TO VIO TO MAC ESI T THIS A SPRING INTERVAL TRAINING WAS DEFINED AS ALL OUT GREATER THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF VIOTO MAX BURSTS OF ACTIVITY THAT LAST EIGHT TO THIRTY SECONDS INTERSPERSE WITH LESS INTENTS RECOVERY PRASE THIS WOULD BE SPRINTING DOWN FIELD FOR EIGHT TO THIRTY SECONDS THEN MAYBE WALKING BACK FOR ABOUT A MINUTE OR TWO AND THEN SPRINTING AGAIN AND THEN CONTINUING O THOU'L BE ESCIT HIT H I IT S DEFINED AS SUBMAXIMAL SO EIGHTY TO A HUNTR PERCENT OF VIO TO MAX BURSTS OF ACTIVIT THAT LAST SIXTY TO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SECONDS INTERSPERSE WITH LESS INTENSE RECOVERY PERIODS SO ON A FORTSTANDARD FOUR HUNDRED METER TRACK JUST TO GIVE THE ILOBIT OF A VISUAL AM YOU ONE A FORMINUTE MILE WOULD BE FANTASTIC FOR MOST PEOPLE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE RUN FASTER THAN THAT OF COURSE SO THAT'S FOUR SIXTY SECOND LAPS BUT THAT'S BACK TO BACK TO BACK AM I THINK IN MY YOU KNOW IN MY BEST SHAPER MAYTWAS IN MY DREAMS I DON'T RECALL WHICH I WAS ABLE TO DO SIXTY SECONDS AROUND THE TRACK BUT OF COURSE I COULDNT GET THAT ON THE SECOND OR THIRD OR FOURTH IF I DID THAT WAS A CERTAINLY A IN T FANTASY LAND AND NOT REALITY BUT SIXTY SECONDS WOULD BE ABOUT ONE REV REVOLUTION AROUND THE TRACK MAY BE MAY BE NINETY SECONDS DEPENDING ON HOW FAST A ONE IS RUNNING SO SIXTEEDED TWO HUNDRED FORTY SECONDS M I C T THIS MODERATE INTENSY CONTINUOUS TRAINING IS STEADY STATE CARDIO SOMETIMES CALLED ZONE TWO CARDIO THESE DAYS ON THE INTERNETE WHICH IS PERFORMED CONTINUOUSLY FOR TWENTY TO SIXTY MINUTES AT MODERATE INTENSITY OF FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT OF VEO TWO MAX OR IF YOU PERFER HEART RATE FIFTY FIVE TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF MAX HEART RATE SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT HIGH MEDIUM AND LOW INTENSITY EXERCISE AL THE LOW INTENSITY AM USUALLY MEANS THAT YOU COULD CARRY ON A CONVERSATION OR MAY BOU HAVE TO GASP EVERY EVERY FEW STEPS OR SO WHILE TRYING TO TALK AND RUN THAT'S I THINK OF GOING TO BE THE MOST USEFUL WAY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING NOW BECAUSETHERE SOW MAN DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXERCISE THAT PEOPLE DO AND INTENSITY IS IMPORTANT LET'S ASK THE QUESTION THAT I THINK MANY OF PEOPLE ARE WANDERING ABOUT IT WHICH IS IS IT BETTER MEANING YOU BURN MORE FAT IF YOU DO YOUR EXERCISE FASTED AND FASTED IN THIS RESPECT COULD BE THAT YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU'VE BEEN FASTING ALL NIGHT YOU JUST HYDRATE AND YOU EXERCISE OR SOMETIMES PEOPLE IN JUST CAFFINE THERE'S CONTROVERSY AS TO WHETHER NOT THAT QUITTING WHAT BREAKS THE FAST ASKED TO DO WITH WHETHER NGHT YOUR CAFFINE ADAPTED SOMETHING FOR ANOTHER EPISODE IN ANY CASE THAT WOULD BE FASTED SO PROBABLY NOT HAVING EATEN ANYTHING FOR ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR MAY BE EVEN MORE AS YOU COULDALSO BE FASTED IN THE AFTERNOON IF YOU HAD LUNCH AT NOON AND IT'S FOUR R FIVE OR SIX P M IS IT WILL YOU BURN MORE FAT IF YOU EXERCISE WITHOUT IN EATING ANYTHING FIRST WITHOUT INCESTING ANY CALORIES FIRST AND PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO REALLY SPLIT HAIRS ON THIS EVERY WHICH WAY PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU CAN FAT FAST BECAUSE FAT AND PROTINE DOESN'T LEAD TO AS GREAT INCREASES IN INSOLEN AS OTHER THINGS MAYBE YOU CAN HAVE A FEW AMONDS AND THEN STILL TRAIN AND INDEED INSOLEN WILL PREVENT FAT OXCIDATION I WANT BE REALLY CLEARED THE BURNING PART OF FAT AN THE SELL THE THE MOVEMENT OF THE FATTY ACID AND IN TO MYTACONDRIA AND THE CONVERSION T A T P INSOLENT INHIBITS THAT PROCESS HOWEVER IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT AT LEAST FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TRAINING IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO MATTER WHETHER NOT YOU EAT BEFOR R TRAINING OR YOU DON'T IF YOUR GOAL IS FAT OXIDATION NOW I WANT TO PUT AN ASTRICS NEAR THAT BECAUSE THERE SOME EXCEPTIONS BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL STUDIES DONE THAT AND T KIND OF THE CLASSIC ONES OF THESE  I'LL I'LL READ OUT TO YOU THEY WHAT THEY BASICALLY DID AS THEY GAVE PEOPLE GLUCOSTS SUGAR BOUD TO INCREASE THEIR BLOOD SUGAR BEFORE TRAINING OR NOT AND THEY CAN A CLASSIC STUDY OF THIS IS ALBORG AT ALL SO NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX O GOES WAY BACK WHICH IS THAT GLUCOS REDUCES FAT BURNING IN EXERISE AND THEN SOME OTER OTHER STUDIES IF YOU WANT TO LOOK THESE UP THEIR VERY EASY TO FIND ON POMETU PUT IN HORROITS NINETEEN NINETY NINE A MLEE IT LEE AT ALL IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE THEY IHAVE PEOPLE DRINK MILK WITH GLUCOS IN ITS O SWEET SUGARY MILK BEFORE EXERCISE ET CETERA AND YOU CAN FIND A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES WHERE EATING BEFORE EXERCISE REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF FAT THAT'S OXIDIZE DURING THE EXERCISE AND YOU CAN ALSO FIND A LOT OF STUDIES SHOWING THAT EATING DURING EXERCISE WILL OR PRIOR TO EXERCISE WILL NOT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FAT THAT OXIDISE HOWEVER THE TYPES OF EXERCISE WITH AN I WAS MEATIUM INTENSITY OR HIGH INTENSITY OR LOW INTENSY IS ALL OVER THE MAP FOR THE STUDYE SO IT'S VERY HARD TO TARGET AND IDEAL PROTOCOL AND THEN IF YOU LOOK REALLY DEEPIN THE LITERATURE YOU STARTS O FINE METANALYSIES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY AGGREGATED ALL THE FINDINGS AND SOME MODERN STUDIES WHERE IT POINTS TO SOME VERY SPECIFIC AND USEFUL PROTOCALS AND SO HURE'S THE RULE THAT OR THE PROTOCALL THAT I EXTRACTED FROM THAT LITERATURE AT A PERIOD OF ABOUT NINETY MINUTES OF MODERATE INTENSITY EXERCISE WHEN BE CLEAR AFTER AT ABOUT OR AFTER NINETY MINUTES OF MODERATE INTENSITY EXERCISE THERE'S A SWITCH OVER POINT WHEREBY IF YOU EIGHT BEFORE THE EXERCISE YOU WILL REDUCE YOU EXCUSE ME YOU WILL BURN FAR LESS FAT FROM THE NINETY MINUTE POINT ONWARD THEN YOU WOULD IF YOU HAD GONE INTO THE TRAINING FASTED SLEM ME REPEAT THAT IF IT'S MODERATE INTENSITY SO CALLED ZONE TOO CARDIOTYPE EXERCISE AT THE NINETY MINUTE POINT IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE EATEN BEFORE THE EXERCISE WITHIN ONE TO THREE HOURS PRIOR TO THE EXERCISE THEN YOU REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FAT THAT YOU WILL BURN FROM NINETY MINUTES ONWARD WHEREAS IF YOU HAD FASTED PRIOR TO THE EXERCISE YOU HADN'T EATEN ANYTHING FOR THREE HOURS OR MORE PRIOR TO THE EXERCISE AT THE NINETY MINUTE POINT YOU WILL NINETY MNUTES OF EXERCISE YOU WILL START TO BURN MORE FAT THAN YOU WOULD HAD YOU EATEN NOW NINETY MINUTES OF MODERATE INTENSITY EXCISES A LOT SO THAT'S IT THAT'S A PRETTY LONG RUN EVEN IF YOUR RUNNING AT A PRETTY SLOW PACE LIKE A TAN OR TWELVE MINUTE MILE THAT'S A LOT OF RUNNING THAT'S A LOT OF SWIMMING SO THAT'S A LOT O WALKING THAT'S A LOT E HEICEN HOWEVER THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING OUT HIKING ALL DAY OR RUNNING ALL DAY OR WALKING ALL DAY AND I YOU WANT TO BURN MORE FAT PERUNIT TIME YOU WANT TO OXIDIZE MORE FAT THAN YOU WOULD DO THAT FASTED NOW THERE ARE ALSO STUDIES THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO NINETY MINUTES IN ORDER TO GET THIS ENHANCED FAT BURNING EFFACT THE STUDIES I WAS ABLE TO FINE AND THAT LOOK TO ME LIKE QUALITY PUREVIEWED STUDIES WITH NO COMPANY BY US OR NO PRODUCT BY US OF ANY KIND ISTERE STUDIES THAT WERE LARGELY FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE UNIVERSITY CONTACT POINT TO THE FACT THAT IF ONE DOES HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING OR OR EVEN THE VERY HIGH INTENSITY FORMS A TRAING LIKE SPRINTS OR SQUATS OR DEAD LIFTS OR ANY KIND OF ACT THIF YOU THAT CAN'T BE MAINTAINED FOR MORE THAN THESE YOU KNOW EIGHT OR I WOULD SAY UP TO SIXTY SECONDS SO A SET OF LIFTING WEIGHTS REPEATED REPEATED IF THAT'S DONE FOR ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY MINUTES SO WEIGHT TRAINING OR POWER LIFTING OR THESE KINDS OFTHING YOUR KETTLE BELL SWINGS OR UP TO SIXTY MINUTES WELL THEN THE SWITCH OVER POINT IN WHICH YOU CAN BURN MORE FAT IF YOU GO INTO THAT FASTED COMES EARLIER AND THIS MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WHOLLY ABOUT THE NINETY MINUTE POINT FOR MEDIUM INTENSITY ZONE TO CARDIO THAT NINETY MINUTE POINT IS THE POINT IN WHICH THE BODY SHIFTS OVER FROM MAINLY BURNING GLICAGIN BASICALLY SUGAR THAT COMES FROM MUSCLES OR THE LIVER AND REALISES THIS IS GOING ON FOR A WHILE I'M IN A SHIFT OVER TO A STORAGE SIGHT FUEL THAT IS IN RESERVE LIKE BODY FAT IT'S THIS IS GOIN TO HAPPEN FOR WHILES FROM IN O START TAPPING INTO BODY FAT STORES NOW FAT DOESN'T HAVE A LITTLE BRAIN THERE IT ISN'T EVAYE BY NURONS BUT OESN'T HAVE THOUGHTS AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CONTROL THI SWITCH WITH YOUR MIND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE MILEU OF VARIOUS HORMONES WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS INSOLENT HAS TO GO DOWN FAR ENOUGH SO IF YOU EIGHT BEFORE THE EXERCISE YOU'D HAVE AT INCREASE IN INSOLENT IF YOU AIHT CARBOHYDRATES YOU'D HAVE A BIGGER INCREASE IN N INSOLENT FAT AND PROTINES INDEED WILL HAVE LOWER MOUNTS OF INSOLENT AND FASTING WILL GIVE YOU THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF INSOLENT WELL THEN THAT SWITCH OVER POINT IS GOING TO COME EARLIER IN THE EXERCISE AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IF YOU WERE TO DO SOMETHING HIGH INTENSITY FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY MINUTES MAY BE LIFT WEIGHTS AND THEN GET INTO ZONE TO CARDIO IF YOU WERE FASTED THE LITERATURE SAYS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BURN MORE BODY FACT PER UNUTE TIME THEN IF YOU HAD EATEN BEFORE OR JURING THE EXERCISE SO WHAT IS THIS MEAN THIS MEANS IF YOU WANT TA BURN MORE BODY FAT IF IT'S IN YOUR PROTOCALLS AND YOUR YOUD' HAVE BEEN APPROVE TO DO THIS SAFELY EXERCISE INTENSELY FOR TWENTY TO SIXTY MINUTES THE HIHER THE INTENSITY OBVIOUSLY THE SHORTER THAT BOUT IS GOING TO BE AND THEN MOVE OVER INTO ZONE TO C ARDYONE IF YOU DO THAT FASTED OR THE MEDIUM INTENSY CARDI I SHOULD SAY AND IF YOU DO THAT FASTED THEN INDEED YOU WILL BURN A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF BODY FAT IF YOU NEED TO EAT OR YOU LIKE TO EAT BEFORE YOU TRAIN THAT ALSO CAN WORK AND IF YOU TRAIN VERY INTENSELY YOU'RE LIKELY TO SHIFT OVER TO THE FAT BURNING PATTERN MORE QUICKLY IS WELL SO AGAIN THIS ISN'T REALLY AN ISSUE OF HOW LONG YOU EXERCISE IT'S AN ISSUE OF HOW INTENSELY YOU EXERCISE AND THERE FOR WHAT FUEL SOURCE YOU'R DRAWING FROM SO WHOLFLY HAVE MADE THAT CLEAR BUT BASICALLY YOU NEED TO DEPLETE LICAGIN OR THROUGH HIG INTENSITY EXERCISE AND THEN MOVE TO A STEADY STATE EXERCISE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BURN MORE FAT OR YOU NEED TO PERFORM A MEDIUM INTENSITY OR LOW INTENSYTYPE EXERCISE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE YOU SHIFT OVER TO BURNING FAT AND INDEED IT SEEMS THAT GOING INTO ALL THAT FASTED WILL FACILITATE THE BURNING OF MORE FAT OVER ALL BUT IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET SITY EXERCISE IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO JUST CAN'T DO THE TRAINING AT ALL YOU'RE UNWILLING TO ORE YOUR INCAPABLE OF TRAINING UNLESS YOU EAT SOMETHING THET OBVIES TY EATING SOMETHING MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND WHAT YOU EAT PRIOR TE EXERCISE THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER IS THAT PEOPLE ARGUE ABOUT AND AND FIGHT ABOUT WHETHER NOT YOU SHOULD GO INTO IT WITH LOW CARBOHYDRATES ARE HIRCOVER ALL OF THAT BUT IN GENERAL THE THEME THERE IS VERY SIMPLE WHICH IS THAT YOU WANT INSOLENT LEVELS TO BE PRETTY LOW IF YOUR GOAL IS BODY FAT REDUCTION IF YOU WANTO OXIDIZE BODY FAT SO FASTING IN SOME CASES FAT FASTING IN OTHER CASES WHERE YOUE JUST INJUSTING FATS FAT AND PROTINE IN SOME CASES OR FOR SOME PEOPLE IT WILL BE EATING CARBOHYDRATES I'M NOT HERE TO DICTATE A PARTICULAR NUTRITION REGIMENT THAT'S JUST HOW THE HORMONE BALANCE OF THESE THINGS AND FAT OXIDATION WORKS NOW ONE THING THAT'S VERY INTERESTING AND CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED IS THIS ISSUE OF HOW MUCH ENERGY YOU BURN DURING AND AFTER THE ACTIVITY AND SOME OF YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS BUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF CALORIES INVERSES CALORIES OUT AND PEOPLE COUNTING THEIR THE NUMBER O CALORIES THEY BURN DURING THEIR EROBIC SESSION N OR DURING THEIR WHATEVER SESSION IS ONLY ONE HAFT OF THE EQUATION AND IT REALLY ECLIPSEIS THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE WHICH IS HOW MUCH OF AN INCREASE IN METABOLISM DOES AT GIVEN EXSERCISE CREATE AFTER THE EXERCISE AND WE COULD TALK FOR HOURS ABOUT THIS BUT THE SIMPLE WAY TO VIEW THIS IS THAT HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING ANOROBIC TRAINING OF WAIGHT TRAINING SPRINTS A BERPEES ANY KIND THING I OU ON THESE DAYS I SEE I HEAR YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSE TO DO BERPIES THAT PEOPLE THIN BERPIES ARE DANGERSO I'M NOT SUGGESTING IN PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS HERE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT'S RIHT FOR YOU A I DO BERPIES I DON'T I DON'T SEEM TO BE INJURED FROM THEM BUT I HEAR THAT THEIR TERRIBLE FOR SOME PEOPLE SO ANYWAY PUSH UP SIT UPS WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE THAT ANOROBIC EXERCISE THAT'S OF HIGHER INTENSITY OR SPRINTS TAPS INTO GLYKAGEN STORES DURING THE MOVEMENT AND WILL BURN MORE ENERGY PERUN AT TIME THEN MODERATE INTENSIY HIGH INTENSTY BURNS MOE THE MODERNTENSY THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT ALL THE STUDIES THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND ON WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT TYPE OF EXERCISE SHOWD THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF FAT THAT YOU BURN AFTER HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE IS ACTUALLY GREATER IN OTHER WORDS YOU BURN A LOT OF GLIKOGEN DURING THE HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE AND THEN AFTER THE EXERCISE THE POST EXERCISE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AS IT SOMETIMES CALLED GOES UP WE KNOW THIS AFTER YOU TRAIN INTENSELY THAT POST EXERCISE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION GOES UP SOMETIMES FOR UP TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND IT IS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU OXIDIZE MORE FAT NOT GLIKOGEN NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE FOR PEOPLE THAT DO LONG BOUTS OF LOW OR MODERATE INTENSITY EXERCISE SO TYPICALLY THIS WOULD BE THINGS LIKE RUNNING SWIMMING BYKING ET CETERA SO SIXTY NINETY MINUTES TWO HOURS MAYBEIN PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAINING FOR MARATHONS OR HALF MARATHONS WHEN THEY STOP TRAINING THEY BURN MORE GELIKOGEN MORE CARBA HYDRATE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE BURNING MORE BODY FAT PER UNIT TIME DURING THE LOW INTENSITY EXERCISE SO THERES THIS KIND OF INVERSION HIGH INTENSY BURNS MORE GLIKYGEN DURING THE ACTIVITYAT MORE BODY FAT AFTERWARDS MODERATE TO LOW INTENSITY BURNS MORE PERCENTAGEWISE MORE BODY FAT IS OXIDISED THAN GLIKOGEN DURING THE MOVEDURING THE ACTUAL EXERCISE AFTERWARD IT'S MORE GLIKOGEN SO I DON'T WANT THIS TO GET TOO COMPLIGATED THE POINT IS YOU SHOULD PICK EXERCISE THAT YOU LIKE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO REGULARLY BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THE HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE FOLLOWED BY MODERATE INTENSTY EXERCISE IS GOING TO BE OPTIMAL FOR FAT BURNING OVER ALL BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF BODY FAT BURNED AND YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL INCREASE IN BAZIL METABOLIC RATE MODERATE AND HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING FOLLOWED BY LOW INTENSITY TRAINING OR EVEN JUST FOLLOWED BY GOING BACK INTO LIFE IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY TO CONTINUE TO BURN BODY FAT BECAUSE THE WAYS THAT IT INCREASES BAZIL METABOLIC RATE OW THIS COULD BE DISTILL THAN TO A SIMPLE PROTOCAL WHEREBY THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK YOU DO HIGH INTENIY TRAINING FOLLOWED BY EITHER NOTHING OR FOLLOWED BY LOW INTENSITY TRAINING SPECIAL IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THAT FASTED AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION THAT NONE OF THE TUFF ABOUT FASTED IS ABOUT PERFORMANCE IF YOU WANT A PERFORM REALLY WELL YOU WAN IT YERE THIS IS FOR REASONS OFE PERFORMANCE AND YOU WANT A YOU ITS FOR A SPORT OR A COMPETITIEN IS NOT FOR BODY FAT PURPOSES WILL THEN ALL THIS KIND OF FALLS AWAY AND IS MODIFIED BY WHAT'SIDEAL TO EAT FOR PERFORMANCE BUT WERE TUNG ABOUT TO DAY IS HOW TO OPTIMIZE BODY FAT A BODY FAT LOSS SO TRAIN MODERATELY TO INTENSELY TO VERY HIGH INTENSITY AND THEN MODERATE TO LOW INTENSITY OR TRAIN MODERATE TO HIGH NTENSITY AND THEN GO ABOUT LIFE AND IN FACT I HAVE A FRIEND WHO ON USES T HIS STRATEGY HE LIKES THE TRAIN INTENSELY AND NOT THAT OFTEN PROTOCOLC AUSE HE'S A VERY BUSY PERSONS SO HE'L TRAIN FOR TWENTIET THIRTY MINUTES INTENSELY WITH WEIGHTS OR JUST BODYWEIGHT MOVEMENT DOING A LOT HE DOES BERPES AND PUSH UPS AND SET UPS AND PULL UPS AND JUST KND OF MOVING IN KIND OF CIRCUIT TYPE TRAINING BUT WHERS BREATHING REALLY HARD THE GOAL HE ALWAYS SAYSIS I WANT A BREATHE HARD FOR THIRTY MINUTES EVERY DAY AND THEN AFTERWARDS HE HYDRATES AND DRINKS COFFEE AND MOVES INTO HIS DAY AND HES WALKING AROUND AND TAKING CALLS AND CARRYING AROUND HIS CHILDREN AND DOING ALL THS KINDS OF THINGS THAT KEEP HIM REALLY BUSY WITH KIND OF LIKE LOW INTENSITY WORK SO THINK YOU GET THE PRINCIPLE NOW BUT YOU SHOULD ALL BE ASKING YOURSELVES AS SCIENTISTS OF YOURSELVES WHY WOULD IT BE THAT CERTAIN PATTERNS OF EXERCISE WOULD LEAD TO MORE OR LESS FAT LOSS IT CAN'T JUST BE ABOUT THE ENERGY BURNED WE ALLREADY ESTABLISH THAT AND AGAIN IT HAS TO DO WITH THE NURONS IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE ENGAGE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SO WHILE NON EXERCISE ACTIVITY IN DUCE THEIRMAGENESIS NEAT THE FIDGETING AND COLD CAN INDUCE THERMOGENESIS BY ENGAGING SHIVER TIGHT MOVEMENT OR LOW LEVEL MOVEMENTS BIG MOVEMENTS THAT ARE OF VERY HIGH INTENSITY MEANING THEY REQUIRE LOT OF EFFORT DEPLOY A LOT OF A DRENOLIN EPINEPERAN FROM OUR NURONS AND SIGNAL PARTICULAR TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF FAT THERMOGENESIS FAT OXIDATION WHEREAS LOW LEVEL INTENSITY EXERCISE LOW OR MODERNTENSITY EXERCISE IN A WALKING RUNNING BIKING WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT EASILY TERE'S NOT VERY MUCH A DRENALINE RELEASE SO A DRENOLINE AN AK EPINEFERAN IS REALLY THE FINAL COMMON PATH BY WHICH MOVEMENT OF ANY KIND WHETHER NOT ITS LOW LEVEL SHIVER WHETHER NOT ITS LIFTING A BAR BELL SPRINTING UP A HILL OR DOING ALONG BYCRIDE A DRENOLINE IS THE EFFECTOR OF FAT LOSS IT'S THE TRIGGER END ITS THE EFFECTOR SO NOW I WANT TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO COMPOUNDS THAT INCREASE EPINEFERON AN A DRENOLINE AS WELL AS COMPOUNDS THAT WORK OUTSIDE THE THE ADRENOLIN EPINEFERAN PATHWAY TO INCREASE THE RATES OF FAT LOSS I ALMOST ALWAYS SAVE COMPOUNDS AND SUPPLEMENTS AND AND THINGS O THAT SORT TO THE END BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK FIRST TOWARD BEHAVIORAL TOOLS AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENCE BEFORE THEY LOOK TOWARD A A SUPPLEMENT OR A PARTICULAR THING THAT THEY CAN EXTRACT FROM DIET THIS IS MAINLY TO TRY AND SHIFT PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE KIND OF MAGIC PILL PHENOMENON OR THE THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A MAGIC PILL BECAUSE THERE REALLY ISN'T AND FRANKLY THERE NEVER WILL BE BUT THERE ARE SOME COMPOUNDS THAT CAN GREATLY INCREASE FAT OXIDATION AND MOBILIZATION AND UNDERSTANDING WHICH COMPOUNDS INCREASE OXIDATION OR MOBILIZATION CAN BE VERY USEFUL IF YOUR GOAL IS TO ECCELERATE FAT LOSS THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN INGEST THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO OXIDIZE MORE FAT AND THAT OCCURS MAINLY BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF EPINEPERAN THAT IS RELEASED FROM NURONS THAT INERVATE FAT TISSUE ONE OF THE MORE COMMON ONES IS ONE THAT YOU MAY ALREADY BE USING WHICH IS KAFFINE IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED THAT KAFFINE CAN INHANCE PERFORMANCE IF YOUR KAFFINE ADAPTED I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN AN EARLIER EPISODES I ONE TO MAKE TRIM VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS IF YOU ARE NOT USED TO DRINKING KAFFINE AND YOU SUDDENLY DECIDE I'M GOING TO DRINK A BIG CUP OF COFFEE BEFORE TRAINING YOU WILL VEZO CONSTRICT AND YOU WILL LIMIT PERFORMANCE THAT'S PERFORMANCE IF YOUR KAFFINE ADAPTED HOWEVER THERE'S THIS CON OF INTERESTING PHENOMENON WHERE INGESTION OF KAFFINE SERVES MORE AS A PERFORMANCE INHANCER BOTH BY INCREASING ALERTNESS BUT ALSO BY WAY OF DILATING VASCULATURE OF ALLOWING MORE BLOODFLOW NOW KAFFINE FOR BURNING MORE FAT FOR OXIDIZING IN MOBILIZING MORE FAT IS AN INTERESTING ONE IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE AT DOSAGES UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IF YOUR KAFFIN SENSITIVE SOME PEOPLE OF JUST THE LITTLEST BIT OF KAFFINE AND THEIR MIND GOES CRAZY AND THEIR VERY UNCOMFORTABLE CAN HAVE CARTY OF ASCULAR EFFECTS FOR SOME PEOPLE WITH HYPROTENSION ET CETERAS A PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BUT FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS IS A ROUGHLY A CUP AND A HALF OF COFFEE OR TWO CUPS OF COFFEE NOWADAYS THERE'S A LOT MORE KAFFINE IN COFFEE SO IF YOU GO TO A TYPICAL A KAFFE AND YOU ARE TO GET THEIRE A MEDIUM SIZE THAT WOULD HAVE CLOSE TO A GRAM OF KAFFINE WHICH IS WHY IF YOUR A REGULAR KAFFINE CONSUMERING YOU DON'T GET THAT GRAHM OF KAFFINE IN YOUR COFF EACH DAY YOU WILL GET A HEADACHE IT CAN CAUSE CONSTRICTION AND DILATION OF BLOOD VESSELS AND WAYSETS COMPLICATED BUT YOU'LL GET A HEADACHE SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE WAY THEY FEEL DRINKING A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED MABEN FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF KAFFINE BEFORE TRAINING AND INDEED THAT WILL LEAD TO INCREASE FAT OXIDATION IT WILL DO THAT BECAUSE YOU WILL RELEASE MORE EPINAFFERAN AND A DRENALINE SO LET'S JUST PLACE THIS IN THE CONTECTS OF WHAT WE SAID PREVIOUSLY LET SAY YOU NORMALLY DU ZOWN TO CARDIO S YOU GOING OUT FOR A MODERATELY INTENSE RUN FOR THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES OR SO THINK THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATION GODLINES IN THE STATES ARE THAT A PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THIRTY MINUTES OF MODERATE INTENSIY EXERCIZE FIVE DAYS A WEEK FOR STHAT'S A HUNDRED FIFTY MINUTES A IF THEIR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE OR MAINTAIN HEALTH OF THE CARTY OFASCULAR SYSTEM EIGHTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES FAIL TO DO THAT OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO IT THEIR WEIT WE ARE WAY BELOW THRESHOLD FOR WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS RECOMMENDED IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK ARE PRETTY GOOD THAT'S A ONE COULD ALWAYS DO BETTER OF COURSE BUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE ARE ANEVEN DOING THAT HOWEVER JUST USING THE LOGIC IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW EPINEFFERAND A DRENALIN IS IS AFFECTING THIS FAT OXIDATION PROCESS IF YOU WERE TO GO OUT FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND YOU DRANK KAFFINE BEFORE YOU WENT YES YOU WILL PROBABLY OXIDIZE MORE FAT PER UNIT TO IME CAN YOU COMPENSATE FOR THE EXERCISE YOU'RE NOT DOING JUST BY DRINKING KAFFINE WELL PROBABLY IF YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT FAT LOSS IF THAT KAFFIN MAKES YOU FIDGET A LOT RIGHT THE AMOUNT OF CALLORIES THAT YOU BURN IN A THIRTY MINUTE RUN UNLESS THE RUN IS VERY INTENS AND YOUR WEARING AWEIGHT VAST AN ITS UP A HILL IT'S NOT THAT GREAT RIGHT YOU PALL YET YOU AND SOMEWHERE INTO THE FOR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED CALORIES BURNED AREA BUT I SAID EARLIER AND THERE ALLOT OF DATANOW THE SUPPORT THAT FIDGETING FOR A DAY CAN BURN ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALLORIES TO DAYS YOU MIGHT THEY WILL FIDGETINGS BETTER THAN RUNNING AH BUT IT DOESN'T TRIGGER THE ACTIVATION AND THE A POSITIVE HEALTH OFFACTS OF THE CARTY OF ASCULAR SYSTEM SO FIDGETING ALONE CAN BE GREAT BUT YOU NEED EXERCISE FOR OTHER REASONS KAFFINE CAN ENHANCE THE AMOUNT OF FAT THAT YOU BURN IN ANY DIRATION OF EXERCISE AND IT CAN SHIFT THE PERCENTAGE A FAT THAT YOU OXIDISE COMPARED TO GLIKECAGEN UNLESS YOU TAKE THAT KAFFINE AND IT RAMPS YOU UP SO MUCH THAT YOURE TRAINING REALLY REALLY INTENSELY THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YOU LIKE KAFFINE AND YOU CAN USE IT SAFELY INGESTING  SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF KAFFIN PRIOR TO EXERCISE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY TO FORTY MENTES BEFORE EXERCISE CAN BE BENEFICIAL IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FAT OXIDATION BURNING MORE BODY FAT SO THAT'S KAFFINE THERE ARE NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE EXISTED OVER THE YEARS THAT ARE IN THIS PATHWAY THINGS LIKE A A FEDRAN WHICH IS NOW ILLEGAL IN MOST STATES I THINK MAY BE IN ALL STATES BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE DROPPING DEAD FROM TAKING A FEDRAN BECAUSE THEY WERE HEATING UP TOO MUCH IT'S INTERESTING THERE IT WASN'T DIRECT EFFECTS ON THE HEART CAUSING HEART ATTACK IT COULD TRIGGER BY WAY OF ADRONERGIC RECEPTORS IF YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW INCREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE AND HEAT NOW THERE THOSE DRUGS TURNED OUT TO BE DANGEROUS BECAUSE PEOPLEWERE OVERHEATING AND DYING THERE WIS ALSO THE BIG FEN FEN CRAZE THERE WAS A DRUG THAT WAS RELEASED A FEN FLURMINE WHICH ACTUALLY WAS QUITE A FACTIVE AS AN ANTI OBICITY DRUG A TREATMEN FOR OBECITY THAT HAD TO BE OUTLAWED AS WELL IT WAS IT WAS SAFTIA APPROVAL WAS REMOVED BECAUSE AGAIN PEOPLE WERE DYING BECAUSE A CARTY OF ASCULAR EFFECTS I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WERE OVERHEATING ON IT AS WELL SO WHAT IS THE SOLUTION IF KAFFINE IS THE KIND OF THE THE ENTRY POINT FOR MOST PEOPLE OF USING COMPOUNDS TO INCREASE THE RATE OR PERCENTAGE OF FAT LOSS IN EXERCISE AND EVEN AT REST WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ARE USEFUL AND INTERESTING WELL IN TERMS OF TOOLS THAT ARE ACTIONABLE AND HAVE REASONABLE SAFETY MARGINS I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT A SOMETHING CALLED GIEL P ONE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A CAN BE TRIGGERED BY THE INGESTION OF YERBAMATE WHICH IS A TEA I GUESS BECAUSE A HALF ARGENTINE THET UGREW UP DRINKING MATIATHINGOS DRINKING MATE FROM THE TIME I WAS ABOUT THREE OR FORTY YEARS OLD I DON'T SUGGEST THAT FOR IDS I DON'T THINK KID SHOULD BE IN GJESTING CAFINE UM BUT ANYWAY I DID IT UM AND I STILL IN GESTMATE MAT INCREASES G L P ONE G L P ON IS IN THE GLUCCUGONE PATHWAYE SELISTIOUS QUICKLY RETURNE T OUR BILE CHEMISTRY AS YOU RECALL FAT AS MOBILIZED FROM BODY FAT STORES AND THEN IT'S BURNED UP IT'S OXIDIZED IN CELLS IT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE CONVERT INTO EH T P AND THOSE FATYACIDS A ARE SENTURY CONVERTING TO  T P IN THE MITO CONDRE OF THE CELL HI INSOLIN PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING AND GLUCCUGON FACILITATES THAT PROCESS GLUCCUGONE FACILITATES THAT PROCESS THROUGH INCREASES IN G L P ONE THE SHORT TAKE AWAY IS MATE INCREASES G L P ONE AND YES INCREASES THE PERCENTAGE OF FAT THAT YOU'LL BURN IT INCREASES FAT BURNING AND THAT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IT TURNS OUT FROM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IF YOU INGEST MATE PRIOR TO EXERCISE OF ANY KIND SO IF YOU WANT TO BURN MORE FAT DRINKING MATE BEFORE EXERCIZE IS GOOD DRINKING IT AT REST WHEN YOU'RE NOT EXERCISING WILL ALSO HELP SHIFT YOUR METABOLISM TORD INHANCED BURNING OF FAT BY INCREASING FAT OXIDATION AND THERE'S A WHOLE CATEGORY OF FARMESUTICLES THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN LATE STAGE TRIALS OR ARE IN USE FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABEDES WHICH CAPITALIZE ON THIS G L P ONE PATHWAY THERE GO BY VARIOUS NAMES AND THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE NNERNET WHO ARE SELLING THESE THINGS THEY ARE PRERSCRIPTION DRUGS AND I WANT EMPHASIZE THAT THEY ARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND YOU OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T WANT USE ANY OF THESE WITH WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION AND A REQUIREMENT THEY DOES SEEM THAT THEY ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN KINDS OF DIABEDIES AND LEAD TO FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT LOSS AND REDUCTION IN APPETITE SO THIS IS KIND OF THE MODERN VERSION OF G L P ONE IS FARMASUTICLS OF G L P ONE OF METABOLISM ARE DRUGS A SUCH AS SEMATICAL SI CAN NEVER PRONOUNCE US CAN'T SEEM TO PRONOUNCE MANYTHINGS PHEEMES A SEMAGLUTIDE IS THE THE WAY I WOULD PRONOUNCE IT S E M A G L U T I D E UM SSEMAGLUTIE BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU PRONOUNCE IT BUT SEMATIGALIDE IS THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED ON THE INNER NET UM IN ANY CASE THIS COMPOUND INCREASES G L P ONE IT'S ACUALLY A G L P ONE ANALOGUE IN SOME CASES AND THEY GO BY VARIOUS TYPES OF OF TRADE NAMES SO THE GO P ONE PATHWAY IS INTERESTING MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF ARE NOT INTERESTED IN TAKING A PERSCRIPTION DRUG TO INCREASE G  P ONE I DO IT THROUGH THE INGESTION OF MATE I JUST GET THE MATE LEAVES POUR WATER OVER IT AND DRINK ET WHAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING THAT'S NOT OFTEN DISCUSSE IS THAT YOU CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF G L P ONE BY YOU CA HSSENTALLY REUSE THE T THE THE FIRST TIME YOU DRINK IS CAN BE VERY A VERY INTENS AND IN FACT SOME PEOPILL FIND THAT A THAT MATE IT IT ALMOST TAKES LIKE BURNT LEAVES ITS TOO INTENTS YOU OT WANT THE WATER TO BE TOO HOT BUT I LEARN THE STRICK FROM A FRIEND YOU CAN REUSE THE LEAVES OVER AND OVER AGAIN PROLY FOR ABOUT A DAY BEFORE THEY GO BAD AND IN DOING THAT YOU START TO EXTRACT MORE AND MORE OF THE COMPOUNDS FROM THE MATE LEAF THAT INCREASE GIOL P ONE SO ITS CANICO YOU CAN GON AGAIN INCREASED EFFECT SO WHAT I'LL TEK IT LY DO IS MAKE A AT A ABOUT SIXTEEN THO THIRTY OUNC OF IN JUST SIPIT TROUGHOUT THE DAY AND I DO LIKE IT BEFORE I TRAIN SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE MATE MIGHT PREFER SOMETHING LIKE GUY USA WHICH IS SPELL G U A Y U S A G U A Y U ESSA GUYUSA WHICH IS FROM EQUADOR DESPITE THE U SSA ENDING TO ITS FROM EQUADOR AND ITS IS IT'S A SWEETER TASTING T DOESN'T HAVE ANY SWEETENER IN IT BUT THE LEAF OF THE GUAUSA PLANT IS SWEETER THAN THE MATE PLANT I SOMETIMES WILL MIX THE TWO AND THEN MAKE THE T WITH THAT AM THE THERE'S NO MATE OR GUY USA SPONSOR OF THE POD CAFSIES ARE JUST TOOLS TO INCREASE GEOL P ONE AND FAT OCCIDATION AND AGAIN THE SMA SEMAGLUTIDE AM IS THE PRESCRIPTION VERSION WHEREOF THE THIS KIND OF THE THE HEAVY ARTILLERY GEOL PE ONE STIMULANT AND AGAIN SHOULD BE ONLY EXPLORED WITH A PRESCRIPTION SO THOSE ARE THE COMPOUNDS THAT THAT REALLY INCREASE FAT OXCIDATION DIRECTLY THERE ARE GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT IMPACT INSOLENT AND GLUCAGON THET ARE GOING TO SHIFT THE BODY TOARD MORE FAT BURNING WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THESE DURING THE EPISODE ON HORMONES WE TALKE ABOUT IT WE DID A WHOLE EPISODE ON HORMONES AND METABOLISM AND SO FOR INSTANCE BERBERINE WHICH COMES FROM A PLANTS OR MET FOREMEN ARE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE NOW IN A AND OF GROWING USE FOR REDUCING BLOOD GLUCOS THEY ARE VERY POTENT AT REDUCING BLOOD GLUCOS WHICH WILL REDUCE INSOLENT BECAUSE THE JOB OF THE HORMONE INSOLEN IS TO ESSENTIALLY MANAGE GLUCOST IN THE BLOODSTREAM SO THERE ARE HUGE GALLERY OF COMPOUNDS THAT WILL REDUCE INSOLEN AND THEREBY CAN INCREASE FAT OCCIDATION AND THAT'S BECAUSE AS I MENTION BEFORE FAT OXCIDATION THIS CONVERSION OF FATY ACIDS INTO A T P IN THE MITACHONDRIA IS INHIBITED BY INSOLENCE O IF YOU KEEP INSOLEN LO YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE THAT PROCESS WHICH BRINGS US FULL CIRCLE BACK TO THE ISSUE OF DIET AND NUTRIPTION THERE IS REALLY SOLID EVIDENCE FROM THE GARDENER LAB AT STAMFORD AND FROM OTHER LABS SHOWING THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT DIETS YOU LOOK AT LO FAT DIETS HIGH FAT DIETS KUETO DIETS INTERMITTEN FASTING PROVIDED PEOPLE STICK TO THEIR PARTICULAR DIE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHICH DIET YOU FOLLOW YOU CAN STILL GET A COLORIC DEFISIT AND YOU GET WEIGHT LOSS ADHERENTS HOWEVER IS ALWAYS IN ISSUE AND SO WHAT I ALWAYS SAY IS THAT YOU WANT TO USE THE EATING PLAN THAT IS OBVIOUSLY BENEFICIAL TO YOUR HEALTH BUT THE ONE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ADD HERE TO WHATEVER ITE IS THAT THE PARTICULAR NEW NUTRICIAN PROTOCAL IS RIGHT IF YOU CAN'T STICK WITH SOMETHING THAN IT'S NOT VERY WORTH WHILE BUT FROM THE PURELY SCIENTIFIC STANDPOINT THERE'S ALSO IN ADVANTAGE TO KEEPING INSOLEND LOW NOW THAT DOESN'T ISSERLY MEAN YOU GO TO ZERO CARBOHYDRATE I'VE TALKED BEFORE MY PREFERRED WAY OF EATING IS TO GO LOWER NO CARBOHYDRATETHROUGHOUT THE DAY FOR ALERTNESS TO GET THAT A DRENNALIN RELEASE AND THE FOCUS THAT GOES WITH IT AT CETERA THE ABILITY AND TO THINK AN MOVE AND DO ALL THE THINGS I NEED YOU TOU DURING THE DAY AND THEN I EAT CARBOHYDRATES AT NIGHT CAUSE IT FACILITATES THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP THAT'S WHAT WORKS FOR ME BUT WHEN INSOLEN IS LOW YOU DO PLACE YOUR SYSTEM IN A POSITION TO OXIDIZE MORE FAT AND SO THAT'S WHYT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DO CE BENEFIT FROM LOWER CARBOHYDRATE OR MODERATE CARBOHYDRATE DIETS BECAUSE WHEN INSOLENT IS LOW YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO OXIDIZE MORE FAT BOTH FROM EXERCISE AND AT RAST AND I SHOULD MENTION A BECAUSE I OFTEN MENTION AND IT'S APPROPRIATE TO MENTION THAT IF YOUARE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF CAFFINE OF MATE GUY USA THINGS TO THAT SORT GIO PE ONE YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THOSE YOU CAN GO TO THIS WONDERFUL WEBSIGHT WHICH IS FREE EXAMINE DOT CAM YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR BAMATE IT WILL DESCRIBE THE THREE STUDIES THAT A SHOW INCREASE FAT OXIDATION BOTH DURING A EXERCISE AND AT REST AND IT AS THE CONSEQUENCE NOT SURPRISING AN INCREASE IN METABOLIC RATE ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT MAT IS IT CAUSES A SLIGHT DECREASE IN HEART RATE FOR REASONS THAT STILL ESCAPE ME THERE'S A SINGLE STUDI SHOWING THAT HEARTRATE IS SLIGHTLY REDUCED WHICH IS KIND OF NICE BECAUSE IF WHEN I DRINK TOO MUCH CAFFINE MY HEART RATE GOES UT MAY BE THAT WOULD INCREASES MY FIDGETING IN MY FAT BURNING BUT I DON'T LIKE THE FEELING OF HAVING MY BAZAL HEARTRATE BEING UP TOO HIGH I LIKE MY HEARTRATE ELEVATURING EXERCISE BUTNOT WHEN I'M JUST KIND OF RESTING YOUR WORKING AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND FOR SOME REASON THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE'S AN EFFECT OF MATE OF INCREASING FAT OXIDATION BUT REDUCING HEARTRATE JUST SLIGHTLY SO THAT'S INTERESTING AND IT PROBABLY LENDS ITSELF TO MY  HAT YOUR EXPLAINS THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD OF THAT MATE IS KIND OF NICE EVEN MELLOW STIMULANT IT'S NOT THIS YOU KNOW REALLY SUPERCHARGE STIMULANT LIKE CAFFINE FROM COFFEE OR OTHER SOURCES ALTHOUGH YOU DRINK TOO MUCH MATE YOU WILL ALSO MAKE YOU GITERY AND THERE'S ONE MORE COMPOUND THAT I THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS IN TERMS OF INCREASING FAT LOSS AND THAT'S CARNATINE OR ASEEDAL ELL CARNATINE THEY LIE IN THE SAME PATHWAY WE CAN RETURN TO OUR BASE IC KNOWLEDGE NOW OF FAT MOBILIZATION AND OXIDATION AFTER FAT IS MOBILIZED AND MAKES IT INTO CELLS AND NEEDS TO BE OXIDIZE SO THE LETEALLY THE BURNING OF FAT AND CONVERSION O IT INTO ENERGY THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED AND IS FACILITATED BY THE PRESENCE OF GLUCCAGON BEING ELEVATED GALPE INCREASES THAT PROCESS AND INSOLEN BEING LOW WE TALKED ABOUT SOME WAYS TO MANAGE INSOLENT BOTH IN THIS EPISODE AND UNPREVIOUS EPISODE ELL CARNATINE AND ACIDAL EL CARNATINE IN PARTICULAR FACILITATES FAT OXIDATION IT CONHELPS CONVERT FATIACIDS INTO A T P AND INDEED SUPPLEMENTING AL CARNATINE CAN INCREASE FAT LOSS THAT'S BEEN SHOWN AT WHAT DOSAGES WELL PEOPLE INJEST ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO TO GRAHMS PER DAY IN DIVIDED DOSE IS TYPICALLY SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXTREME ARE TAKING INJECTABLE EL CARNATINE IVE CERTAINLY NOT TRIED THAT UMI CONFESS I HAVE USED IT IN PIL FORM FROM TIME TO TIME BUT IN PART BECAUSE OF THE FAT OXIDATION EFFECTS BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE OTHER EFFECTS THAT IT TENDS TO HAVE SO IN EXPLORING THE EFFECTS THAT LSEEDAL CARNATINE HAS IT HAS A HUGE VARIETY OF EF FECTS ON CELLAR R METABOLISM IT CAN REDUCE AMMONIA IN THE BLOOD THAT IS ACTUALLY QUITE STRONG EFFECT IT CAN REDUCE THINGS LIKE SEA REACTIVE PROTINE WHICH IS YOU WANT SEA REACTIVE PROTINE LEVELS TO BE MANAGED YOU DO NOT WANT THEM TOO HIGH CAN SLIGHTLY REDUCE BLOOD GLUCCOS IT CAN SLIGHTLY INCREASE IT STEALCY THE GOOD FORM OF OF THE BLOOD LIPID AND SLIGHTLY REDUCE OVER ALL COLLESTERAL AND AS I MENTION IT CAN SLIGHTLY MODIFY THE PATHWAY INVOLVING LUCAGON SUCH THAT YOU GET A CONSIDERABLE EFFECT NOT A HUGE EFFECT ON FAT OXIDATION SO CAN IMPROVE FAT OXIDATION RATES IT HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER EFFECTS SOME OF WHICH I TALKED ABOUT DURING THE A MONTH ON HORMONS AND A THAT SORT OF THING IT HAS STRONG EFFECTS ON RATES OF PREGNACY AND SPERM QUALITIE SO CLEARLY CARNATING THIS DOING LOTS OF EVERY THINGS AND LOTS A DIFFERENT CELLS ITS IMPACTING SPERM MOTILITY THEREIN A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES SUPPORTING THAT SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND HAS THESE INTERESTING EFFECTS OF REDUCING FATIGUE DURING EXERCISE REDUCING IN FLAMMATORY MARKERS LIKE INTERLUCAN SIX SO T HAS A NUMBER OF EFFECTS THAT ON THE WHOLE ARE QOTING POSITIVE OR AT LEAST IN THE DIRECTION OF THINGS THAT YOU MAY WANT AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE MAY YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED A SEDAL AL CARNATINE IN ORDER TO A LOSE FAT BUT NOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE CELLAR PROCESS BY WHICH FAT IS MOBILIZED AND OXIDZED IT SHOULD MAKE SENSE THAT IF AL CARNATINES IMPORTANT FOR CONVERTING FATIACIDS INTO ENERGY THEN SUPPLEMENTING EL CARNATINE MAKE SENSE A CIDALEL CARNATINE IS THE TYPE OF AL CARNATINE OR THE FORM OF EL CARNATINE I SHOULD SAY THAT IS TRANSPORTED AND UTILIZED MOST EASILY BY THEBODY AND SO THAT'S WHY SOMETIMES WE DISTINGUISH TWEEN EL CARNATINE AND ACEEDALOL CARNATINE SO ONCE AGAIN WE'VE COVERED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SCIGHENCE OF FATLOSS AND IN PARTICULAR WE'VE EXPLORED THIS TOPIC FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HOW NURONS AND IN PARTICULAR THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE A DRENOLIN EPINEFERAN CAN FACILITATE FAT MOBILIZATION AND OXIDATION WE TALKED ABOUT NEAT FIDGETING THIS NON EXERCISE TYPE MOVEMENT THAT CAN GREATLY INCREASE COLORIC BURN AND WHY THAT IS WE TALKED ABOUT SHIVER ANOTHER FORM OF NON EXERCISE MOVEMENT THAT CAN REALLY INCREASE BOTH COLORIC EXPENDITURE DUE TO THE SHIVER DUE TO THE MOVEMENT AS WELL AS INCREASE THERMOGENESIS THE HEATING UP OF THE BODY THROUGH THINGS LIKE BROWN FAT AND EVEN THE CONVERSION OF WHITE FAT TO BROWN FAT WHICH IS A GOOD THING IF YOU WANT OXIDIZE FAT WE TALKED ABOUT COLD AS A PARTICULAR STIMULUS TO INDUCE SHIVER AND HOW TO USE GETTING INTO AND OUT OF COLD AS A WAY TO STIMULATE SHIVER AND AVOID COLD ADAPTATION SO THAT YOU CONTINUE TO OXIDIZE AND BURN FAT IF THAT'S YOUR GOAL IF YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE PROTOCALS FOR THAT THEREAT THE COLD PLUNGE DOT CALM AND IN WEEKS TO COME WEARE GOING TO BE ADDING MORE PROTOCALS TO THAT WEBSITE NOT JUST FOR FAT LOSS BUT FOR THINGS LIKE RAZILIANTS REDUCING INFLAMMATION ET CETERA SO BE SURE TO CHECK THOSE OUT AGAIN THOSE ARE TOTALLY COST FREE TALKED ABOUT EXERCISE HOW RATHER THAN THINKING ABOUT CARTIOF ASCULAR OR WEIGHT TRAINING EXERCISE THAT WE SHOULD PERHAPS LOOK THROUGH THE LENDS OF THIS A DRENOLINE SYSTEM AND HOW IT INTERACTS WITH FAT STORES AND THINK ABOUT LOW MEDIUM OR HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE WHETHER NOT WE SHOW UP TO THAT FATED OR NOT TURNS OUT SHOWING UP TO THAT FASTED CAN BE USEFUL IF YOU START WITH HIGH INTENSITY MOVEMENTS AND THEN MOVE INTO LOWER INTENSITY TYPE EXERCISE IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO LONG DURATION IT PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER UNLESS YOUR EXERCISING LONGER THAN NINETY MINUTES WHETHER NOT YOU EAT OR NOT WE TALKED ABOUT CAFFINE AS A STIMULANT AND E STIMULIS FOR EPINEFERAN AND A DRENOLINE RELEASE AS A WAY TO AXESS MORE FAT MATABOLISM AND WE TALKED ABOUT COMPOUNDS THAT COME FROM THINGS LIKE ERBOMATE AND GUYUCSA TEE THIS GIOL PE ONE PATHWAY THAT CAN TRIGGER INCREASED FAT OXIDATION SO MUCH SO THAT THE PHARMOSUITICAL COMPANIES ARE NOW DEVELOPING COMPOUND SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE GEOL PE ONE FOR TREATMENT OF DIABEDES AND OBISITY BUT YOU CAN LEVERAGE THE GEOLPE ONE PATHWAY THROUGH THE INGESTION OF THINGS LIKE MATE OR GUYUSA IF THAT'S OF INTEREST TO YOU AND THEN WE TALKD ABOUT AL CARNATINE AND HOW ELCARNATINE ITSELF IS CRITICAL FOR THE FAT OXIDATION WITHIN INDIVIDUAL CELLS THE CONVERSION OF FATYACIDS TO ENERGY AND WHY HAVING YOUR INSOLEN LOW AND THINGS LIKE ALL CARNATINE AND GLUCAGON LEVELS HIGH OR SUFFICIENT AT LEAST TO CAN FACILITATE THE BURNING OF FAT FAT OXIDATION SO WE COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL THAT'S A LOT OF PROTOCOLS I REALIZE IN THAT DIDN A THE LIST I JUST GAVE RIGHT THERETAN EVEN BEGIN TO GET INTO ALL THE DETAILS AND CORNERS THAT WE DISCUSSED I HOPE YOU'VE FOUND THIS CONVERSATION INTERESTING BOTH FOR SAKE OF UNDERSTANDING FAT LOSS AND HOW TO LOSE FAT MORE QUICKLY AND TO LOSE MORE OF IT IF THAT'S YOUR GOAL AS WELL AS SIMPLY TO UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGY OF FATMOTABOLISM FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IF YOU'R ENJOYING THIS PODCAST AND YOU'R

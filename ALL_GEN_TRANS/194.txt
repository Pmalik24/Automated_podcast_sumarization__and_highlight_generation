GLASS STAY WITH US AT ON WITHNESS FOR THE BARBACUTION CHARLOTTEHOLDMAN DIDN'T YOUS GET THE IDEA OF CALLING A CHICKEN AS A WITNESS IN A MURDER CASE OUT OF THE BLUE SHE'S WORKING ON THIS CASE AND WHAT GONNOT CALL THESKY HARRY AND THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THE GUY HAD KILLED SOMEBODY IS ONE BYT WHETHER HE DONE IT IS JUS ABOUT WHAT SENTENCE HE WOULD GET HE HAD SAT ON DEATH ROW AT SAN QUENTON FOR TEN YEARS BUT SHARLOTE SAYS HE WAS GETS A FRENIC WITH AN NI CUE OF FIFTY EIGHT AND JUST OT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY HE WANTED THE THINGS HE DID A HE WROTE MESSAGES IN SYMBOLS ON LITTLE PIECES OF TOILET PAPER AND ROLLED HIM UP IN A BALL AND HAD DONE THIS FREE YEARS ON DEATH RE ROLLED TE LITTLE SECRET MESSAGES UP IN A BALL AND THEN ROLLED THEM AN FE SES HIS OWN FACES AND THEN TO LITTLE TINY BEADSIZED BALLS AND PUT THOS INTO THE BRADS IN HIS HAIR OHMA SAID THAT THEY DANGLED AROUND HIS FOREHEAD AND ANYANE THINKS HE WAS BEENING IN HIS HAIR NNDAND FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW THAT WITH A COMMUNICATING SOME INFORMATION THE LITTLE MESSAGES EXACTLY BUT HE COULDN'T TELL ME WHA THE MESSAGES WERE BEC CAUS THEY WERE SECRET I WOEN OVER TALK TO ABOUT HIS MOTHER HE WOULD TELL ME SHE LIVED IN A COCACOLACANE IT'S AGAINS THE LOW TO EXECUTE SOMEBODY WHO IS SO CRAZY HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S BEING EXECUTED AND  SHOW IT SAI THAT WAS TRUE FOR THE SKY HEN I WOULD SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE TWELFTH OF JUNE A HE WITH KIND O BE FUDDLED AND I WITH PRESSURE HE WOULD FINALLY SAY WILL YOUT HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE REAPHOLSTERED THE SAY TO CALFORNA DID NOT AGREE WITH SHOIT ABOUT THE SKY THEY WANTED YOU EXECUTE HIM IN THIRTY DAYS SHOW ITS TEAM O WAS MAKING A LAST DITCH APPEAL TO STAV THIS EXECUTION ME WHILE THE STATE WAS GATHERING ITS EVIDENCE SAND QUINTON SENT IN A PRISON PSYCHIATRIST TO DETERMINED WAS HE COMPETENT TO BE EXECUTED DID HE KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE EXECUTED AND DID HE KNOW WHY HE WAS GOIN TO BE EXECUTED SO THE PSYCHITRIST GOES AND INTERVIEWS HARY AND THEN THE PSYCHIATRIST TESTIFIED IN COURT THAT NOT ONLY WAS HARRY AWARE THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE EXECUTED SHE WAS SO SERTAIN OF THIS BECAUSE SHE HAD PLAYED CHICK TACK TO WITH HIM AND HARRY HAD BEAT HER WELL IT WAS SO ABSURD AND AND SO OUTSIDE OF IE  NORMAL EXPERIENCE IN COURT ROOM AND THIS S AFTER YUOF THIRTY YEARS OF BEEING DEATHPENALTY CASES IN THE SOUTH AROUND THE WORLD AND A YOU KNOW I REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE SHE HAD SAID IT BUT AD THE SAME TIME THE ONLY IMAGE THAT CAME TO ME IM FROM THE PSOUTH OBVIOUSLY A AND GROWN UP WE ALWAYS WENT TO A THE MIDSOUTH FARE AND THEY HAD A CHICKEN THAT PLAYED CHICK TACTO THAT ABSOLUTELY MISMARIZED ME AND IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR TO ME AKA WE'VE GOT TO FIND A CHICKEN WHO CAN PLAY CICK TECTO SHOW I THOUGHT AND THIS'S NOT A JOKE IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION SHE THOUGHT THAT A CHICKEN LIKE THAT COULD SAVE THIS MAN'S LIKE JURYS AFTER A AND TO BELIEVE THE STATE AND IT'S WITNESS'S AND A CHICKEN LIKE THAT COULD TOTALLY UNDER MINE THE PSYCHITERIS TESTIMONY BY PROVING THAT PLAYING TITATO DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE WHY YOU'RE BEING EXECUTED I JUST KNEW A CHICKEN WOULD WORK IE JUST SAD SAYE BUT I THINK A CHICKEN HAS MORE CREDIBILITY THAN A THE DEFENCE TEAM DID AND AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BUT BROUGHT THE JURY OVER TO SEE IN US HIS PEOPLE RATHER THAN IS THE OBSTRUCTION AS WHO WERE INTERFERING WITH THA AN EXECUTION AND WHO CAN DOUT A CHICKEN N YOU CAN'T YOU D BED CHICKENS ARE GOT A LIE A CHICKENS HAVE A INTEGRITY I HAD THIS IMAGE OF OF THE PSYCHIATRIST BEING ON THE STAND AN I WULD QUIETLY INNER THROUGH THE WOUDEN DOORS AS THEY OPEN WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL LEGONE UNDER MY ARM RIT AND THE CONE AT A RACISHON AND AS I WALKED INTO THE COURT ROOM NOT SAYING A WORD QUIETLY TOOK A SEAT ON THE FRONT ROAD THE PSYCHIATRIST WHO WE KNEW BECAUSE WE'D INVESTIGATED HER BACKGROUNDS FROM NEW YORK SITTY WOULD SEE A PERSON WITH A CHICKEN AND THING QUIE IS THAT OH MY GOD NO AN THAT SI HIATRI WOULD SLOWLY REALIZED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY CHICKTAKTO WITH A CHICKEN SO YOUR TRYING TO SYK OUT YOU ERE TRYING TO GET INSIDE THE PSYCHITRIS HEAD T HE MADE AT A CHITRIS IN ON A RIVAL EVEN BEFORE YOU FOR YOUR STOA JURYS EYES AS A WARINESS OVERCAME HER SO IT COULDNAT IT WOULDNAT WORK WITH THE FRAZLED CHICKEN AN I DIDN'T WANT A SPLOTCHY BEAT UP TIRED EXHAUSTED CHICKENI WANTED A CHICKEN THAT COULD CAPTURE OF THE AUDIENCES ATTENCTION IN THIS CASE AUDIENCE WAS THE JURY RI I NEE T NT EET TIT  G I TI CHICKENG LIKE IN A CARTUNE LOOK I HAD TO HAVE A CHICKEN THAT COU TICK ON THE PSYCHIATRIS YOU KNOW IT I A DO BE  STAND UP CHICKEN NO SO A WE BEGAN TO HUNT FOR THIS STAND U CHICKEN FOR THE TASSA FELL TO THE ILEGAL INTURNS A MAN WAS CITOR TO DIET THAT POINTING LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AND THEY NEEDED A CHICKEN AND THEY SEARCHD THE PACES THAT YOU FIND TICKTAK TOE PLAYING CHICKENS NAMELY COUNTIFEIRS CARNIVALS AND REALLY WITHIN HOURS THEY FOUND A TIKTAKTOE PLAYING GOOSE IN MONTANA BUT CORCHARLOTTE SAYS THAT WAS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE I MEAN GUASES ARE NANTY YOU NOTHER BITE YOU THERE THEYARE NOT I D WANTED GOOSE OF RUNNING ROUND THE COURTROOM CHICKEN SOME ONE NEXT WAS GUIDO ROADSIDE STANDWYOMING WHO DID HAVE A CHICKEN AND IT DID PLAY TIK TAK TOE BUT HE SAID THAT A FLYING OR DRIVING IT TO CALIFORNIA FOR THE TRIAL WOULD PROBABLY UPSET IT SO MUCH THAT HE COULD NOT GUARAN TEE THAT IT WOULD WIN THE GAME OF CHICKTAK TOE SO HE WAS OUT FINALLY THEY FIND A FELLOW YIN ARKANSAW WHO TRAINS CHICKENS TO PLAY TICK TAKTOE AND HE HAD A WHOLE WIST OF CHICKENS THAT HE TRAINED AROUND THE COUNTRY AND HE SENT THE LEGAL TEEM TO ONE OF THOSE BIRDS IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A DEAD END A SEVETISCO HAD ACTUALLY PASSED AN ORDINANCE BANNING THE PLAYING OF TIK TAK TOE BY CHICKENS IS ANIMAL CRUELTY FORTUNATELY ANOTHER CHICKEN ON THE LIST WAS NOT FAR FROM THERE AT THE BOARD WALK ITS SANICRUWS THEY HAD THEIR CHICKEN SO THE NEXT ELT WAS TO CONVINCED THE COURT TO LET US BRING THE CHICKEN TO COURT AS A WITNESS AS DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE TO INTRODUCED THE CHICKEN AND LET THE CHICKEN PLAY THICK TEK TOE NOW OF COURSE I WANTED THA CHICKEN TO PLAY TIK TAK TOE WITH THE PCYCHITRICS BUT I REALIZED YOU NUT YET THET MOST LIKELY NO ONE WAS GOING TO LET US GET AWAY WITH THAT BUT I DI THAT IN OF US YOU KNE I RE HEALTHY GROUP OF IN TURNS TANON HOW TO PLAY TIKTAK TOE SO THAT WE COULD DEMONSTRATE TO THE JURY THAT PLAY TIKTAK TOE DID NOT MEAN THAT YOU WERE AWARE OF YOUR COT THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS WHY WOULDN'T WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE ALLOWED TO MAKE THE PCYCHIATRIS PLAY TIK TAKTOE WITH THE CHICKEN LI CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE PCYCHATRIST WOULD NOT WANT TO DO IT BUT FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW LIKE WHAT WHAT LINED DOES THAT CROSS WELL EVIDENTLY I AGREE WITH YOU BUT I THE COURT FAIL IT NEVER DRESSED ISSUE OF HAVING TO PLAYED THE THAT THE PCYCHITRIS BUT THE COURT SELL THAT BRINGING THE CHICKEN INTO THE COURT ROOM TO PLAY TIK TAK TOE WUL DEGRADE THE DIGNITY OF THE COURT I THOUGHT THAT THE DIGNITY THE COURT WAS DEGRATED BY EXECUTING A A LEAL PERSON I SO THE COURT DENIED OUR MOTION AND SAID WE COULD NOT BRING THE CHICKEN INTO THE COURT ROOM FOR A DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE IT RULES AGAINST US THEY WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO SHOW THE JURY OF VIDIO OF THE CHICKEN PLAYING TICTAK TOE AND WITHOUT A CHICKEN ON THE STAND WITHOUT A VIDIEW OF A CHICKEN THE JURY FOUND THE PSCHIATRIS CREDIBLE AND RULED TO EXECUTE CHARLOTT'S CLIENT HIS LIFE WAS SAVED LATER ON A PEA AND IN THE AR SINCE THEN IN TWO THOUSAND TO THE SPREMCOURT RULE THAT A PERSON AT HIS LEVEL OF MENTAL RETARDATION CANNOT BE EXECUTED FOR CHARLOTT THOUGH THE STORY STAYS WITH HER THE STORY OF THE CHICKEN BECAUSE IN DECATES OF DOING THESE CAPITAL TRIALS BRINGING HUNDREDS OF WITNESS IS IT IS THE GREATEST COURT REMOVE SHE EVER INVENTED BRINGING IN THE CHICKEN AND SHE NEVER GOT TO TRY IT YOU KNOW SHE INVENTED THES THING SHE NEVER GOT TO TRY IT IT WAS SNATCHED AWAY FROM HER SOMETHNG LIKE THAT STICKS IN YOUR CROW WELL YELL BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET TO DO IT BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THE NATURE AND QUALITY OF A CHICKEN WHEN YOU DI THIS KIND OF WORK YOU KNOWING YOU'R DOWN IN A THE WORST PART WHEN YOURE TRYING TO WORK FOR O TET LITERALLY THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO KEEP  IT CAN BE PRETTY

THI TO SAY THEY SAW HM ON THE STHAT NOW ON FERRY THAT NIGHT HIS BODY WAS FINALLY FOUND PULT OUT OF THE EAST RIVER TWO MONTHS LATER OR PROGAM TO DAY IS ABOUT BIRDS AND THE HOLD THEY HAVE ON US  CATHING WE SO TELLS THE STORY ABOUT SPALDINGS LAST NIGHT IN THE DAY'S MEDYAWAY AFTER THAT I CUN JUST SAID HER HUSBAND WAS WITH TWO OTHER KIDS THAT NIGHT SHE WAS OUT THIVE A THIRD CHILD FOREST WHO WAS ELEVEN AT THE TIME HE WAS IN SAG HARBOUR LONG ISLAND WITH FRIENDS AND A BABY SITTER THAT HOUSEOT THERE TOO SPALDING HAD HAD DINNER WITH THE KIDS AND THEN IT GOT TO BE ABOUT SEVEN PIM HE SAID HE WAS COULD MEET OLD FRIEND AND MORISSICGOS AL THAT'S FINDYOU KNOW I'M HERE I CAN I CAN WATCH THEO AND HE WENT OUT AND ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF AFTER THAT HE CALLED CHECKIN ON THE KIDS THEO ANSWERED AND HE SAID HOWSE EVERYTHING GOING WAS GOOD GOESWELL I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL BE HOME SOONT AND WE NEVER SAW SPALDING AGAIN THE NEXT SERIES OF EVENTS A STILL SEEMED LIKE A BLUR TO ME EVEN FIVE YEARS LATER BUT THE FIRST THING I HAD TO DO WAS GO REPORT SPALDING MISSING I DID THAT AND THEN I DECIDE TO SEND THE KIDS HOME BACK TO SAG HARBOUR SO JOIN THE BROTHER SO I STAYED FOR TWO DAYS DID WHATEVER I COULD WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH NOTHING AND AFTER TWO DAYS I JUST DECIDED IO'N GOING BACK TO SAGHARBOURD JOIN ALL THE KIDS SO I'M DRIVING ON THE LONG ISLAND EXPRESS WAY BACK TO SAG HARBOUR AND I GET A FON CALL MY SOUTHON AND IT WAS THEO HE WAS ALL EXCITED AND HE SAID MAMAM WE CAME HOME TO DAY FROM SCHOOL AND THERE WAS A BIRD A LITTLE BIRD FLYING AROUND THE ISLAND IN THE KITCHEN I SAID IN THE WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT HE SAID WILL WE WE FALLED THE BIRD AND MARISSA FALLED HIM INTO THE BATH ROOM AND SHE TRIED TO CALM THE BIRD AND SHE TOOK A HAT AND CUPPED IT OVER THE BIRD AND CAPTURED THE BIRD AND WENT OUTSIDE AND LET HIM OUT FREE AND I WAS JUST SO DUM FOUNDED AN AN OWSTRUCK THE FIRST IMAGE THAT CAME TO MY HEAD WHEN HE SAID THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING  A BIRD IN PARTICULAR WS A CIRCLING OVER THIS ISLAND WAS I THOUGHT OF SPALDING AND HOW FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HE HAD OBCESSIVELY CIRCLED AROUND THAT ISLAND TALKING TO HIMSELF JUST CIRCLING IN AN TOTAL ANGUISH YOU SEE TWO YEARS BEFORE THT WE HAD BEEN IN IRELAND CELEBRATING HIS SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY AND THE SECOND DAY THERE SPALDING AND I WERE IN A HORRIBLE CAR ACCIDENT SPALDING SUFFERED ENORMOUS HEDTROMA ON HE WAS NEVER THE SAME THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO PUT TITANNIAN PLATE IN HIS HEAD HE WAS IN AND OUT A HOSPITALS FOR TWO YEARS AFTER THE ACCIDENT DOCTER'S PRESCRIBED VARIOUS COCKTAILS A PILLS FOR HIM NOTHING WORKED NOT EVEN THE A TWENTY ELECTRIC SHOCK TREATMENTS THAT HE HAD AND THIS SECOND THOUGHT I HAD WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE BIRD WAS WAS AS THE MESSAGE FROM SPLDING WAS HE TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING WEVE NEVER HAD A BIRD IN OR HOUSE BEFORE AND I REMEMBER THE IRISH HAVE THE SAYING THAT IF YOU FIND A BIRD IN YOUR HOUSE AFTER SOME ONE DIES AND IT'S ALIVE THE PERSON SOUL IS FREE AND IF YOU FIND A DEAD BIRD THE PERSON SOUL IS RESTLESS AND I REMEMBER SPALDING I'LL NEVER FORGET THE STORY AFTER HIS MOTHER KILLED HERSELF THIRTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE HIS FATHER WOKE UP THE VERY NEXT DAY AND NEXT TO HIS BED WHERE HIS SLIPPERS WERE ON THE FLOORE WAS A DEAD BIRD AND THAT STORY JUST STAYED WITH ME SO THAT NIGHT AFTER THE KIDS WENT TO BED I WENT AROUND THE HOUSE AND I WAS MAKING SURE THAT ANOTHER BIRD COULD NOT GET INTO THIS HOUSE CAUSE I WASN'T GOTO TAKE THE CHANCE OF ANOTHER BRD COMING INTO THE HOUSE AND AND DYING SO I CHECKED ALL THE WINDOWS AND I CLOSED ALL THE FIREPLACES TO MAKE SURE TO GUARANTEE THAT THERE IS NO WAY A BIRD COULD COME INTO OUR HOUSE AND THE NEXT DAY I WAS AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE READING THE PAPER AND I LOOKED UP AND THERE WAS A BIRD ACROSS THE TABLE PEERING AT ME AND I I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING SO I YELL OUT TO THE KIDS WHO ARE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND THEY RUN IN AND THE BIRD TAKES OFF AND FLIES UP THE STAIRS AND WE ALL FOLLOW IT AND WE GO IT GOES INTO WHAT'S OUR OFFICE AND IT'S PERCHED ON TOP OF THIS WINDOW AND I SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND FOR SOME REASON I HELD OUP MY HANDS THINKING THE BIRD MY MAGICALLY YOU KNOW COME TO MY HANDS AND I GO SPALDING IT'S O KEY YOUR SAFE NOW IT'S O KAY COME TO ME AND FOREST AND THEO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR GOING MOM WHY ARE YOU CALLING THE BIRD AFTER DAD AND THE BIRCHES SAT THERE STARING AT ME AND THEN IT TOOK OFF AND IT FLEW OVER MY HANDS AND IN BETWEEN THE SPACE AND BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE FLOOR IT'S SCOOTED OUT WENT PAST THE BOYS FLEW DOWN THE STAIRS AND WE HAD ALREADY OPENED UP THE KITCHEN DOORS AND IT FLEW OUT THE KITCHEN DOORS AND IT WAS SAFE ANDIT WAS GONE THE NEXT DAY I'M IN THE KITCHEN AND FOREST CALLS OUT FROM THE TEVY ROOM HE WAS WATCHING CARTUNS IT GOES MOM THE BIRD'S BACK IT'S AT THE END OF THE COUCH SO BEFORE IBEEN GOING TO THE ROOM I OPEN UP THE KITCHEN DOORS JUST MAKE SURE WE HAVENAT EXIT FOR THE BIRD AND I RUN INTO THE FAMILY ROOM AND SURE ENOUGH THEREIS THE BRD AND WE DO IT'S LIKE BECOME A DRILL NOW THIS IS THE THIRD DAY CONSECUTIVE DAY WITH THE BIRD IN OUR HOUSE AND WE FALL TH BIRD AROUND AND T GOT THIS TIME IT GOES THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM THAN IT COMES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN AND I ACTUALLY GOT THE CAMEROUT AND I TOOK A PICTURE OF IT AND THE BIRD FLEW OUT JUST LIKE THAT IT WAS GONE AND TWO MONTHS LATER THEY FOUND SPALDINGS PODY AND THE EASTE RIVER I THINK WITH SUICIDE IN PARTICULAR IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD DEATH TO DI JUST THERE'S A LOT OF GILT YOU GO BACK AND BACK AND YOU GET INTO THAT MOD OF I SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS I COULD HAVE DONE THAT A IT'S IT'S A SEAS OFF OF GUILT AND FORGIVENESS SO LAST YEAR WAS MY FORTY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY AND I WAS FEELING KIND OF BLUE AND I WAS REALLY MISSING SPALDING AND I WEN ON THIS ON BIKE RUT THAT THE TWO OF US USED TO TAKE TOGETHER AND IT ENDS UP BY THE WATER AND JUST BEFORE I GOT TO THE WATER I SAW THIS LITTLE BROWNISH GRAY BIRD SITTING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD JUST LIKE THE ONE THAT WE HAD IN OUR HOUSE AND I PASSED BY T ON MY BIKE I I RIDE PRETTY FAST BUT SOMETHING TOLD ME GO BACK AND I DID IN THE BIRD WAS JUST SITTING THERE AND I GET UP CLOSE TO AND TIM FLYAWAY SO I FIGURED THE BIRD WAS HURT AND I'M LOOKING AT THE BIRD CROUCHING OVER IT AND THIS JOGGER GOES BY ME AND HE SAID OH THAT BIRD WAS THERE TWO HOURS AGO WHEN I STARTD MY RUN SO I RACE BACK HOME ON MY BIKE AND I WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND I COLLECTED A SHOE BOX AND I FILLED IT WITH GRASS AND BIRD SEY GOT SOME RUPER GLOVES AND I DROVE BACK TO WHERE THE BIRD WAS AND THE BIRD WAS SIL THERE WAS ABOUT A MILE FROM MY HOUSE AND IT'S JUST LOOKING UP AT ME SO I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY HURD AND I TRIED TO SCOOP IT INTO THE SHOEBOX AND IT JUST GETS UP LOOKS AT ME AND FLIES AWAY THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT WINGS WERE FINE I SAW IT FLYING OFF INTO THE DISTANCE AND I THOUGHT IT JUST HIT ME LIKE

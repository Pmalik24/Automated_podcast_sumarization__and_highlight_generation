WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN ACONCANS W A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO E FOR  I M AN DRUHUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY WE ARE DISCUSSING BREATHING A BREATHING IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE FRANKLY WE ARE ALL DOING IT RIGHT NOW AND WE DO IT DURING OUR WAKING STATES END WHILE WE ARE ASLEEP AND MOST OF US HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THAT BREATHING IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE WE HEAR THAT WE CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT FOOD FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME MAY BE EVEN UP TO A MONTH OR MORE THAT WE CAN'T SURVIVE THAT LONG WITHOUT WATER BUT WE COULD SURVIVE A FEW DAYS WITHOUT WATER DEPENDING ON HOW WELL HYDRATED WE ARE WHEN WE GO INTO THAT WATER DEPRIVATION AND THE HEAT OF THE ENVIRONMENT WE HAPPEN TO BEGIN BUT THAT WE CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT BREATHING FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES N THAT IF WE CEASE TO BREATHE THAT OUR BRAIN AND OUR BODILY TISSUES WILL DIE AND IN FACT THAT IS TRUE HOWEVER DESPITE EVERYBODY'S KNOWLEDGE THAT BREATHING IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE I DON'T THNK THAT MOST PEOPLE REALIZE JUST HOW IMPORTANT HOW WE BREATHE IS TO OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND THAT INCLUDES OUR MENTAL HEALTH OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH AND WHAT WE CALL PERFORMANCE THAT IS OUR ABILITY TO TAPPEN TO SKILLS EITHER PHYSICAL OR COGNITIVE IN WAYS THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OTHERWISE IF WE ARE NOT BREATHING CORRECTLY SO TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO BREATHE CORRECTLY BOTH AT REST DURING SLEEP IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR LEVELS OF STRESS IN ORDER TO WAKE UP OR TO BECOME MORE ALERT DELIBERATELY AND MANY MANY OTHER THINGS INCLUDING HOW TO STOP HICKUPPING THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SEARCH FOR TOPICS ON THE INTERNETE TO DAY I WILL TEACH YOU THE ONE METHOD THAT IS ACTUALLY LINKED TO SCIENCE NOW IT DOES NOT INVOLVE DRINKING A GLASS OF WATER BACKWARDS FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CUP OR HOLDING YOUR BREATH IN ANY KIND OF A ESOTERIC WAY IT ACTUALY RELATES TO THE NURAL MECHANISMS THAT IS THE BRAINTOBODY CONNECTIONS THAT CAUSE THE HICCUP HICO IS A SPASM OF THAT NURAL CIRCUIT AND I'LL TEACH YOU OW TO TURN OFF THAT NERAL CIRCUIT IN ONE TRY AND THAT'S NOT A TECHNIQUE I DEVELOPED IT'S A TECHNIQUE THAT'S USHA BEEN KNOWN ABOUT FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES AND WE NOW KNOW THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM SO TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL GIVE TO YOU MANY TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY ALL OF THESE TOOLS ARE OF COURSE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THERE COMPLETELY ZERO COST AND IN TELLING YOU HOW THOSE TOOLS WORK YOU'LL LEARN A LOT ABOUT HOW THE BREATHING ACHA THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM WORKS AND HOW IT INTERFACES WITH THE OTHER ORGANS AND TISSUES OF THE BODY IN PARTICULAR THE BRAIN IN FACT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT BREATHING RIGHT HERE AT THE OUTSET IS THAT BREATHING IS UNIQUE AMONG BRAIN AND BODILY FUNCTIONS IN THAT IT LIES AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN OUR CONSCIOUS AND OUR SUBCONSCIOUS BEHAVIOR AND IT REPRESENTS A BRIDGE LITERALLY IN THE BRAIN BETWEEN THE CONSCIOUS AND THE SUB CONSCIOUS WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL BREATHING DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO OUR BREATHING OR THAT WE ARE EVEN AWARE THAT WE ARE BREATHING IT WILL JUST CARRY ON IN THE BACKGROUND EITHER NORMALLY OR ABNORMALLY N TEACH YOU WHAT NORMAL AND ABNORMAL BREATHING IS IN THE LITTLE BIT HOWEVER BREATHING IS UNIQUE AMONG BRAIN AND BODILY FUNCTIONS IN THAT AT ANY MOMENT WE CAN CONSCIOUSLY TAKE CONTROL OF HOW WE BREATHE THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR AND HIGHLY UNUSUAL FEATURE OF BRAIN FUNCTION FOR INSTANCE YOUR DIGESTION IS CARRYING ON IN THE BACKGROUND RIGHT NOW WHETHER NOT YOU'VE HAD FOOD RECENTLY OR NOT BUT YOU CAN'T SIMPLY CONTROL YOUR DIGESTION BY THINKING ABOUT IT IN A PARTICULAR WAY IN FACT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN CONTROL THEIR THINKING BY TRYING TO CONTROL THEIR THINKING THAT ACTUALLY TAKE SOME PRACTICE IT CAN BE DONE TOPIC FOR A FUTURE EPISODE HOWEVER BREATHING IS UNIQUE BREATHING WILL CARRY ON INVOLUNTARILY SUBCONSCIOUSLY IN THE BACKGROUND AS I SAID BEFORE BUT IF AT ANY MOMENT YOU WANT TO HOLD YOUR BREATH OR INHALE MORE DEEPLY WERE VIGOROUSLY OR EXHALE LONGER THAN YOU INHALE YOU CAN DO THAT VERY FEW IF ANY OTHER NURL CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY ALLOW THAT LEVEL OF CONTROL AND TURNS OUT THAT LEVEL CONTROL IS NOT AN ACCIDENT IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZE THAT BY CONTROLLING BREATHING THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY A TEMPTING TO CONTROL ITS OWN STATE OF MIND NOW THE WAY THIS WAS ORIGINALLY STATED IN A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PAPER WAS A LABIT DIFFERENT AS LIBIT MORE PHYSIOLOGICAL THE STATEMENT WAS THE BRAIN BY REGULATING BREATHING CONTROLS ITS OWN EXCITEABILITY EXCITABILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF NEUROBIOLOGY IS HOW ABLE THE BRAIN IS TO TAKE IN NEW INFORMATION OR NOT HOW ABLE THE BRAIN IS OR NOT TO TURN ITSELF OFF TO GO TO SLEEP AND TO REGULATE ITS OWN LEVELS OF ANXSIETY FOCUS ET CETERA IF THAT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT ABSTRACT I'LL MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR YOU BY CHANGING YOUR PATTERN OF BREATHING YOU CAN VERY QUICKALLY CHANGE WHAT YOUR BRAIN IS CAPABLE OF DOING IN FACT LO IT LATER I'LL TELL YOU THAT WHILE YOU INHALE YOU ARE FAR BETTER AT LEARNING AND REMEMBERING INFORMATION THAN DURING AN EXHALE AND IT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE OES THAT MEAN YOU SHOULD ONLY INHALE AND NOT EXELLE KNOW OF COURSE NOT I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO BREATHE FOR THE SAKE OF LEARNING IN MEMORY AS WELL AS FOR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS SO HOPEFULLY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIGHLATE FOR YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF BREATHING NOT JUST FOR LIFE BECAUSE YES BREATHING IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE BUT THAT THE SUBTLETIES OF HOW WE BREATHE THE DURATION AND INTENSITY OF OUR INHALES AND OUR EXHALES HOW LONG WE HOLD OUR BREATH BETWEEN INHALES AND EXHALES VERY CRITICALLY DEFINES OUR STATE OF MIND AND OUR STATE OF BODY WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO AND WHAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO AND THE GREAT NEWS IS WE CAN CONTROL OUR BREATHING AND IN DOING SO CONTROL ARE MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEME T IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUXIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHYSITES AN COGNITIVE END PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACTOLECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDR MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENT DOC COM SLAX HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT BREATHING AND OF COURSE WE BREATHE IN ORDER TO BRING OXYGEN INTO THE BODY BUT WE ALSO BREATHE TO REMOVE CERTAIN THINGS FROM OUR BODY IN PARTICULAR CARBONDOXIDE SO THE MAIN PLAYERS IN TODAY'S DISCUSSION ARE GOING TO BE OXYGEN AND CARBONOXIDE NOW A COMMON MISCONCEPTION IS THAT OXYGEN IS GOOD AND CARBONDIOXIDE IS BAD THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE LET'S JUST TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THAT STATEMEN AND LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS WHEN WE BREATHE IN WE ARE LARGELY BREATHING IN ARA IN ORDER TO BRING OXYGEN INTO OUR BODY AND WE CAN JUST STOP RIGHT THERE AND SAY WHY DO WE BREATHE AT ALL WHAT WHY CAN'T WE JUST GET OXYGEN FROM THE WORLD AROUND US WELL IT'S BECAUSE OXYGEN CAN'T DIFFUSE THROUGH OUR SKIN INTO THE DEEPER CELLS OF OUR BODY OTHER SINGLE CELL AND VERY SIMPLE ORGANISMS CAN NACTUALLY BRING OXYGEN INTO THEIR SYSTEM WITHOUT THE NEED TO BREATHE BUT WE HAVE TO BREATHE IN ORDER TO BRING OXYGEN TO THE CELLS THAT RESIDE DEEP IN OUR BODY IN PARTICULAR OUR BRAIN CELLS WHICH ARE THE MOST METABOLICALLY OCTIVE CELLS OUR BODY REQUIRE A LOT OF OXYGEN AND THOSE BRAIN CELLS ARE SITTING COURSE IN THE BRAIN WHICH IS IN CASED IN THE CRANIAL VAULT THE SKULL AND SO OXYGENS CAN'T SIMPLLY PASS TO THOSE CELLS SO WE NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WILL DELIVER OXYGEN TO THOSE CELLS WE ALSO NEED A SYSTEM ICH TURNS OUT TO BE THE BREATHING OR RESPIRATORY SYSTEM THAT CAN ALL FLOAD OR REMOVE THE GAS THAT WE CALL CARBONDIOXIDE NOT BECAUSE CARBONDOXIDE IS BAD BUT BECAUSE TOO MUCH OF IT IN OUR SYSTEM IS NOT GOOD IN FACT MUCH OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL ALSO CENTER ROUND THE COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT CARBONDOXCIDE IS SOMETHING THA WE WANT TO GET RID OF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF TOO MUCH CARBONDOXIDE OR ELSE YOU CAN'T OXUALLY GET OXYGEN TO THE CELLS AND TISSUES OF YOUR BODY IN AN EFFICIENT WAY SO YOU NEED OXYGEN AND YOU NEED CARBONDOXIDE IN YOUR BODY YOU ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO ALL FLOAD OR REMOVE CARBONDOXIDE AND BRING IN OXYGEN IN THE CORRECT RATIOS SO THAT YOU CAN PERFORM THE KIND OF MENTAL FUNCTIONS AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO SO IF WE JUST DIAL OUT EVEN FURTHER WE SAY WHAT ARE THE KEY COMPONENTS OF BREATHING WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS WITHIN THE BODY THAT ALLOW US TO BRING OXYGEN TO THE TISSUES AND CELLS AS IS REQUIRED AND REMOVE CARBONDOXIDE FROM THE BODY AS IS REQUIRED AND YET KEEP ENOUGH CARBONDOXIDE AROUND IN ORDER TO ALLOW OXYGEN TO DO ITS THING WELL THAT BREATHING OR RESPIRATORY APPARATUS HAS TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS AND I'M GOING TO JUST BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THOSE AND AS I DO THIS I REALLY WANT A HIGHLIHTE THE FACT THAT ANY TIMEYOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BIOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY IN PARTICULAR WHETHER NOTS ABOUT THE BRAIN OR THE LIVER OR THE GUTMICROBYOM IT'S USEFUL TO CATEGRIZE THINGS EITHER AS MECHANICAL MECHANISMS OR CHEMICAL MECHANISMS WHAT O I MEAN BY THAT WILL IS JUST TAKE THE ANALOGY OF HUNGER THERE ARE MECHANICAL MECHANISMS THAT TELL US WHEN WE SHOULD EAT FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE NURONS NERVE CELLS IN YOUR GUT THAT SIGNAL HOW STRETCHED OR NON STRETCH THE WALLS OF YOUR STOMACH ARE HOW FULL OR HOW EMPTY OUR GUT IS AND SEND THAT INFORMATION TO THE BRAIN TO MAKE YOU FEEL TO SOME EXTENT HUNGRY OR NOT HUNGRY IN GENERAL WHEN OUR STOMICH IS VERY FULL ESPECIALLYIF IT'S VERY DISTENDED EVEN WITH LIQUID IT SUPPRESSES OUR HUNGER WHEREAS WHEN OUR STOMACH IS DEVOID OF THAT MECHANICAL PRESSURE SPECIALLY FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS IT TENDS TO TRIGGER HUNGER BY SIGNALING VIANURONS TO THE BRAING IN ADDITION THERE ARE CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT GO FROM THE GUT TO THE BRAIN FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE NURONS IN OUR GUT THAT CAN DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A MENOACIDS FROM PROTINES THAT WE EAT FATYACIDS FROM THE FOODS THAT WE EAT THE LIPIDS AND SUGARS DIFFERENT FORMS OF CARBOHYDRATE THE NURONS IN OUR GUT ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO OR RESPOND TO HOW MUCH A MENOACID FATYACID AND CARBOHYDRATE IS IN OUR GUT AND SEND SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN TO EITHER STIMULATE OR SUPPRESS HUNGER SO THOSE ARE CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT ARE BEING PASSED FROM GUT TO BRAIN AND THEY WORK IN PARALLEL WITH THE MECHANICAL SIGNALS AND THIS IDEA OF INPARALLEL WITH AGAIN AS A VERY COMMON THEME IN BIOLOGY ESPECIALLY NUROSCIENCE THE TERM PARALLEL PATHWAYS REFERS TO THE FACT THAT ANY TIME THERE'S A CRITICAL BODILY FUNCTION IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT JUST ONE TYPE OF INFORMATION LIKE JUST MECHANICAL INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED ALMOST ALWAYS IT'S GOING TO BE MECHANICAL AN CHEMICAL INFORMATION I COULD PICK A NUMBER OF OTHER EXAMPLES FOR INSTANCE IF A YOU WANT TO AVOID DAMAGING YOUR SKIN OR OTHER TISSUES OF YOUR BODY WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE WELL THEN YOU HAVE MECHANICAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOR INSTANCE WHETHER NOT SOMETHING IS PINCHING OR READY TO PERCIOR SKIN THAT'S MECHANICAL INFORMATION ITS SEND VIA SPECIFIC NURONS UP TO THE BRAIN TO SIGNAL A RETRACTION REFLECTS OF YOU MOVE YOUR LIMB AWAY FROM WHEREVER THAT INTENSE PRESSURE IS COMING YOU ALSO HAVE CHEMICAL SENSING IN YOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THINGS THAT ELICIT A BURN OR THAT ELICIT ITCH OR THAT ELICIT EXTREME COLD ALL THAT CHEMICAL INFORMATION ITS BEING SIGNALLED UP TO THE BRAIN IS WELL IN PARALLELS OR PARALLEL PATHWAYS IS A COMMON THEME SO WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE RESPIRATION ACH A THE BREATHING SYSTEM WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE NOSE THE MOUTH THELUNGS ET CETERA THAT ALLOW OXYGEN TO BE BROUGHT IN AND CARBONDOXIDE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE BODY BUT NOT TOO MUCH CARBONDOX I'VE REMOVED TO ALLOW BREATHING TO WORK AS EFFICIENTLY AND AS OPTIMALLY IS POSSIBLE AND THEN WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE CHEMICAL SYSTEMS OF THE LUNGS THE BLOOD STREAM AND HOW DIFFERENT CELLS USE OXYGEN IN CARBONDOXIDE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS WELL IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING EVEN JUST AT A TOP CONTOUR WILL THEN THE VARIOUS TOOLS THAT I DISCUSS DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO CALM YOURSELF DOWN MOST QUICKLY BY DOING WHAT'S CALLED A PHYSIAL OCICAL SIGH ALL GOING TO THIS IN MORE DETAIL NALO BIT BUT THIS IS TOO VERY DEEP INHALS THROUGH THE NOSE SO THE FIRST ONE IS A LONG INHALE AND THEN THE SECOND ONE AFTER THAT IS A QUICK SHARP INHAL TO MAXIMALLY INFLATE YOUR LUNGS FOLLOWED BY A FULL EXHALE THROUGH THE MOUTH TO LUNGS COMPLETELY EMPTY SO IT'S BIG INHALE THROUGH THE NOSE THEN SHORT INHAL THROUGH THE NOSE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT IN ORDER TO MAXIMALLY INFLATE THE LUNGS AND THEN A LONG EXHALE THROUGH THE MOUTH UNTIL YOUR LUNGS ARE EMPTY YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY THAT PARTICULAR PATTERN OR BREATHING AND NOT SIMPLY ONE INHAL ERE NOT SIMPLY AN IN INHAL THROUGH THE NOSE AND AN EXHALE THROUGH THE NOSE IS WELL IS OPTIMAL FOR REDUCING YOUR STRESS QUICKLY THAT DOUBLE INHALE THROUGH THE NOSE FOLLOWED BY A LONG EXAL THROUGH THE MOUTH WORKS TO REDUCE YOUR LEVELS OF STRESS AND LOWEROUR LEVELS HOVE SO CALLED AUTONOMIC ARAUSAL VERY FAST IN REAL TIME AND IT WORKS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER KNOWN APPROACH IT'S NOT A HACK THIS IS ASHALY SOMETHING THAT YOUR BODY HAS SPECIFIC NRAL CIRCUITS TO DO AND ASHALLY PERFORMS DURING SLEEP ON A PROREGULAR BASIS AND EVEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THAT YOU CAN PERFORM VOLUNTARILY AND IT WORK SO WELL TO REDUCE STRESS VERY QUICKLY NOT BECAUSE IT BRINGS IN THE MAXIM AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AND REMOVES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF CARBONDOXIDE BUT RATHER BECAUSE IT OPTIMATELY BALANCES OXYGEN IN CARBONDOXIDE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHY THAT PARTICULAR PATTERN OF BREATHING THE SO CALLED PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE IS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO RAPIDLY REDUCE STRESS IN REAL TIDE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING YOU WILL ALSO UNDERSTAND WHY MOST PEOPLE ARE OVERBREATHING THAT IS THEIR BREATHING TOO OFTEN EVEN IF THEIR BREATHING IN A SHALLOW MANNER THEIR BREATHING TOO OFTEN AND THEY ARE BLOWING OFF FOR REMOVING TOO MUCH CARBOND OXIDE AND IF YOU UNDERSTAND THET CARBONDOXIDE IS CRITICAL FOR THE WAY THE OXYGEN IS DELIVERED FROM THE BLOOD STREAM TO THE TISSUES OF THE BODY INCLUDING THE BRAIN WILL THEN IT WILL MAKE VERY GOOD SENSE AS TO WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE BREATHING TOO MUCH DON'T ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE ALL THE EFFECTS OF ELEVATED OXYGEN BUT RATHER THEIR PUTTING THEIR BODY INTO WHAT'S CALLE THE HYPOXIC STATE THEY'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN TO THE TISSUES OF THE BODY IN PARTICULAR THEIR BRAIN AND THIS IS TRUE NOTCHAS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OBEASE OR WHO SUFFER FROM SLEEP APNIA OR ALTHOUGH THAT CERTAINLY THE CASE BUT FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BELIEVE OR NOT CERTAIN PERSONALITY TYPES WILL TALK ABOUT BREATHING IN PERSONALITY TYPE AND ACTUALLY HOW BREATHING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ALTER PERSONALITY THAT'S RIGHT BREATHING CAN ALT OR PERSONALITY IN POSITIVE WAYS THAT ALLOW ANY ONE TO SHOW UP TO THE VARIOUS SOCIAL AND NON SOCIAL ENDEAVORS OF THEIR LIFE WITH MORE CALM MORE FOCUS ALERTNESS AND IMPROVE THEIR OVER ALL HEALTH O CASE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MECHANICAL COMPONENTS OF BREATHING IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE YOU'VE GOT YOUR NOSE OBVIOUSLY AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR MOUTH AND A LIMIT LATER WILL TALK ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE ADVANTAGES OF BEING A NASAL BREATHER MOST OF THE TIME BUT ALSO THE INCREDIBLE ADVANTAGES OF USING YOUR MOUTH TO BREATHE BOTH FOR INHALES AND EXHALES DURING PARTICULAR TYPES OF ENDEAVORS AND WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT ELOW LATER BUT FOR THE MEANTINE THE ONLY TWO WAYS TO BRING AIR INTO YOUR SYSTEM ARE THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND THROUGH YOUR MOUTH WE ALSO HAVE THE LARINKS WHICH IS A RIGID TISSUE OR PIPE THAT BRINGS THE AIR FROM THE NOSE AND MOUTH DOWN TO THE LUNGS NOW THAT WORD RIGID IS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE WHAT WE WILL SOON LEARN IS THAT YOUR LUNGS BASICALLY ACT LIKE A PUMP YOU SORT OF KNOW THIS ALREADY BUT THESE ARE TOO BIG BAGS BASICALLY THAT CAN FILL WITH AIR OR THAT CAN SQUEEZE AIR OUT NOW WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT THE LUNGS ARE NOT JUST TOO BIG BAGS OF AIR YOUR LUNGS ARE ACTUALLY TOO BIG BAGS OF AIR THAT INSIDE OF THEM HAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF LITTLE SACKS THAT ARE CALLED THE AVIOLY OF THE LUNGS AND BY HAVING THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF LITTLE SACKS YOU INCREASE THE SURFACE AREA OF THE LUNGS AND BY INCREASING THE SURFACE AREA YOU ALLOW MORE OXYGEN TO PASS FROM THE AIR IN YOUR LUNGS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM THEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THOSE SACKS AND YOU ALLOW MORE CARBONDIOXIDE TO MOVE FROM THE BLOOD STREAM INTO THOSE SACTS OF THE LUNGS AND THAN WHEN YOU EXHALE THE CARBONIOXIDE CAN BE REMOVED CASE SO THOSE LITTLE SAC WECAL AVIOLY OF THE LUNGS ARE INAN IMPORTANT PART OF THE MECHANICAL ASPECT OF BREATHING WILL GET TO A LOBIT LATER I SO AT A FIRST PASS THE MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING ARE REALLY STRAIGHT FOR RED YET YOU CAN BEATHROUGH YUR NOSE YOU REATHE YOUR MOUTH GOES DOWN THROUGH THE LARANXS I TOLD YOU THE LERINGS IS A RIGID PIPE THE LUNGS ARE NOT RIGID THAY CAN EXPAND AND THEY CAN CONTRACT LIKE A PUMP TO BRING IN AIR OR TO EXPEL AIR KEEP IN MINE THAT THE LUNGS DO NOT HAVE ANY MUSCLES THEMSELVES SO WE NEED MUSCLES THAT CAN EITHER SQUEEZE THE LUNGS OR THAT WILL ALLOW THE LUNGS TO EXPAND AND THEIRE TWO GENERAL GROUPS OF MUSCLES THAT DO THAT AND THEY ARE THE DIAPHRAM AND THE SO CALLED INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES THE DIAPHRAM IS A THIN MUSCLE THAT SITS BELOW THE LUNGS AND ABOVE THE LIVER AND WHEN WE INHAIL PROVIDED THAT WE ARE USING WHAT'S CALLED DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING THAT DIAPHRAM CONTRACTS AND WHEN IT CONTRACTS IT MOVES DOWN WHICH ALLOWS MORE SPACE FOR THE LUNGS TO INFLATE WITH EIRE NOW THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES ARE THE MUSCLES BETWEEN OUR RIBS A NUMBER PEOPLE THO PROBABLY DON'T REALIZE THIS BUT YOUR RIBS OF COURSE A BONE BUT IN BETWEEN THOSE BONES YOU HAVE MUSCLES AND THEY INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES WHEN YOU INHAL CONTRACT AND THAT ALLOWS YOUR RIB CAGE TO MOVE UP AND TO EXPAND OF IT I THINK AGAIN PEOPLE PROBLY DON'T REALIZE THAT YOUR RIBS ARE NOT FIXED IN PLACE THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET FURTHER AND CLOSER APART FROM ONE ANOTHER SO WHEN YOU INHAIL YOUR RIB CAGE ACTUALLY MOVES UP SOMETIMES THE SHOULDERS WILL MOVE UP AS WELL THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES ARE CONTRACTING NOW MUSCLES CAN'T MOVE ON THEIR OWN THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY NERVES SO WE'VE GOT THE NOSE THE MOWL THE LARINCS AND THE LUNGS THE LUNGS HAVE ALL THOSE LE AVIOLE IN THEM AND AS I TOLD YOU WE'VE GOT THE DIAPHRAM AS A MUSCLE TO MOVE THE LUNGS AND WE HAVE THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES TO MOVE THE RIBS WHICH CAN ALLOW THE LUNGS TO EXPAND AGAIN WHERE JUST ON THE MECHANICAL COMPONENTS OF BREATHING BUT BECAUSE MUSCLES CAN'T MOVE THEMSELVES YOU SHOULD BE ASKING WHAT MOVES THE MUSCLES AND IT'S REALLY NERVES THAT CONTROL MUSCLES SO WHETHER NOT YOUR CONTRACTING YOUR BISABS ARE YOUR WALKING IN YOUR CONTRACTING YOUR QUADROSEPS AND YOUR HAMSTRINGS IN YOUR CALF MUSCLES IT'S NURONS NERVE CELLS THAT CONTROLL THAT THERE IS A SPECIALIZED NERVE CALLED THE FRENIC NERVE P H RE E AND ICY FRENIC NERVE THAT COMES OUT OF THE NECK AND WHEN I SAY IT COMES OUT OF THE NECK WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THEIR LITTLE NURONS THAT RESIDE IN THE BRAINSTEM IN THE BACKIER BRAIN AND THEY SEND LITTLE WIRES THAT WE CALL AXONS DOWN AND OUT OF THE NECK THEY GO CLOSE TO THE HEART AND A LOBIT BEHIND IT AND THEY GO DOWN AND THEY FORM SYNAPS AS THAT IS THEY FORM CONNECTIONS WITH THE DIAPHRAM AND WHEN THOSE NURONS RELEASE NERO TRANSMITTER WHICH ARE LITWL CHEMICALS THE DIAPHRAM CONTRACTSION IT MOVES DOWN SO WE SAY THAT THE PHRENIC NERVE IS A MOTOR NERVE IS DESIGNED TO MOVE MUSCLE HOWEVER THE PHRENIC NERVE LIKE A FEW OTHER NERVES IN THE BODY IS INTERESTING IN THAT IT HAS NONCIOUS MOTOR NERVES IN THERE NURONS THAT CONTROL THE CONTRACTIONOL MUSCLES IT ALSO CAN SENSE THINGS THERE HAS SENSORY NURONS SO IT ALSO SENDS CONNECTIONS DOWN TO THE DIAPHRAM AND ACTUALLY DOWN DEEP INTO THE DIAPHRAMING CLOSE TO THE LIVER AND NOTE THAT I SAID LIVER TWICE NOW ALREADY WERE GON TO GET BACK TO THIS LATER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PHYSICAL MOVEMENT AND CRAMPS OF THE BODY THOSE CENSERY NURNS DIVE DEEP INTO THE DIAPHRAM AND THN THEY GO BACK UP TO THE BRAIN AND THEY ALLOW YOU TO SENSE WHERE THE DIAPHRAM IS SO TERE GIVING INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THE DIAPHRAM IS IN YOUR BODY NOW MOST THE TIM YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS BUT RIGHT NOW YOU CANNOT HALLY TRY THIS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THIS DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING IS IN MANY WAYS THE IDEAL WAY TO BREATHE IND THAT IT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO BREATH WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN EXACTLY WHEN WE SEE BREATHING EFFICIENCY LATER BUT THE DIAPHRAM IS DESINE TO ALLOW THE LUNGS TO EXPAND OR TO CONTRACT THE LUNGS TO BRING AIR IN TO THE BODY OR TO REMOVE CARBONOXIDE FROM THE BODY AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHETHER NOT YOUR USING DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING IT'S VERY SIMPLE IF YOU INHALE PROBABLY BEST TO DO THIS TROUGH THE NOSE BT YOU COULD DO IT THROUGH THE MOUTH IF YOU INHALE AND YOUR BELLY MOVES OUTWARD ON THE INHAL WELL THEN THAT FHRANIC NERVE IS CONTROLLING YOUR DIAPHRAM PROPERLY AND THEN WHEN YOU EXHALE YOUR BELLYES SHOULD GO IN JUST A LITTLE BIT THAT'S DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING NOW DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING IS TALKED ABOUT IN THE CONTECTS OF YOGA IT'S OFTEN TALKED ABOUT IS A WAI TO CALM DOWN AND SO ON BUT DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING IS JUST ONE MODE BY WHICH YOUR BRAIN AND THE PHRANTIC NERVE CAN CONTROL MUSCLE THE DIAPHRAM TO CONTROL THE MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF THE LUNGS TO BRING IN AIR AND EXPEL AIR SO MENTION BEFORE YOU ALSO HAVE THESE MUSCLES BETWEEN YOUR RIBS WERE THE INTERCOSTALE MUSCLES AND THERE'S A SEPARATE SET OF NERVES THAT ALLOW THOSE MUSCLES TO CONTRACT AND FOR YOUR RIB CAGE TO EXPAND IN ORDER TO CREATE MORE ROOM FOR YOUR LUNGS TO GET LARGER AND FILL WITH AIR OR FOR YOUR RIBCAGE TO CONTRACT A BIT WHEN THOSE MUSCLES RELAX IN ORDER TO EXPEL IR I'D LIKE TO GO ON RECORD BY SAYING THAT THERE IS NO RULE THAT DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING IS BETTER THAN BREATHING WHERE YOUR RIB CAGE MOVES THIS IS A COMMON MIS CONCEPTION PEOPLE SAY OH YOU NO IF YOUR SHOULDERS ARE GOING UP AND DOWN IN YOUR YOUR RIB CAGES MOVING WHILE YOUR BREATHING WILL THEN YOU'R NOT BREATHING RIGHT AND IF YOUR BELLY GOES OUT AND ON THE REST OF YOUR BODY IS STILL WHILE YOU BREATHE WHLE THEN YOUR BREATHING CORRECTLY I KNOW OF ZERO IN FACT ZERO MINNESS ONE DATA TO SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PARALLEL MECHANISMS TO CONTROL THE MECHANICS OF YOUR LUNGS AND FOR BREATHING AND WHEN YOU'RE EXERTING YOURSELF VERY HARD YOU TEND TO USE BOTH THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES AND YOUR RIB CAGE MOVING AS WELL AS YOUR DIAPHRAM IN ORDER TO BRING IN A LOT OF OXYGEN AND TO OFF LOAT A LOT OF CARBONDOXIDE AND WHEN YOUR CALMER FRANKALLY YOU COULD USE DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING OR YOU COULD USE RIB CAGE TIGHT BREATHING IN ORDER TO BRING ENOUGH OXYGEN INTO YOUR SYSTEM THERE'S NO REAL DATA SHOWING THAT DIAPHROMATIC BREATHING IS SOMEHOW BETTER OR WORSE HOWEVER BEING ABLE TO MECHANICALLY CONTROL THOSE INDEPENDENTLY OR TO COMBINE THEM AND USE THEM TOGETHER IS OF TREMENDOUS POWER TOWARD REGULATING YOUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STATES AND WI'LL TALK ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT LOBIT LATER FOR RIGHT NOW PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THESE DIFFERENT MECHANICAL COMPONENTS THEN ALLOW YOU TO BRING OXYGEN INTO YOUR SYSTEM AND TO EXPEL AIR AND TO THEREBY AFF LOAD CARBONOXIDE FROM YOUR SYSTEM AGAIND WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE GA S EXCHANGE OF CARBOND OXIDE AND OXYGEN AND HOW THAT'S HAPPENING THE BLOODSTRUM WILL TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT BUT THE BASIC MECHANICAL COMPONENTS ARE PRETTY SIMPLE RIGHT ONCE AGAIN JUST TO RE VIEW ITS NOSE MOUTH LARINXS LUNGS IVIOBLY WITHIN THE LUNGS AND THEN THOSE TWO MUSCLES THE DIAPHRAM IN THE INTRCOSTLE MUSCLES OF THE RIBS ONE THING I FAIL TO MENTION IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THAT LARANXS BE RIGID THAT IT'S A A TUBE THAT IS VERY RIGID AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT UNLIKE THE LUNGS WHICH YOU WANT TO ACT AS SORT OF A A BELLOW PUMP WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN DEFLATE IT AND INFLATE IT IN ORDER TO MOVE AIR IN AND OUT THE LARINKS NEEDS TO BE RIGID SO THAT IT DOESN'T COLLAPSE WHILE YOU'RE BRINGING AIR IN AND OUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IF IT WAS A VERY FLIMSY TUBE OR IT OR THE WALLS OF THE LARINGS WERE VERY FLIMSY AND THIN WELL TEN YOU CAN IMAGIN BREATHING IN VERY VIGOROUSLY AND IT WOULD SHUT LIKE A TUBE A THAT SUDDENLY FLATTENS ON ITSELF WHICH IS WOULD NOT BE GOOD SO THE FACT THAT THE LARANCE IS RIGID IS ACTUALLY A VERY CRUCIAL PART OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM THE OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO THE MECHANICS OF BREATHING IS THE FACT THAT YOUR NOSE IN YOUR MOUTH HAVE DIFFERENT RESISTANCES TO AIR YOU CAN PROBABLY NOTICE THIS RIGHT NOW IF YOU WERE FOR INSTANCE BREATHE IN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH AND ONLY THRUGH YOUR MOUTH VERSES BREATHE IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE SOME OF YOU PERHAPS HAVE A HARDER TIME BREATHING IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE BY THE WAY IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL THAT ONE OR THE OTHER NOSTRIL WOULD BE HARDER TO BREATHE THROUGH OR EASIER TO BREATH THROUGH IN THAT THAT SWITCHES ACROSS THE DAY AS TO DO WITH THE FLOW OF MUCHIS AND THREET ROSPINAL FLOOD AND INTRCRANIAL PRESSURE TOTALLY NORMAL MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THINK THEY HAVE A DEVIATED SEPTEM WHO DON'T ACTUALY HAVE A DEVIATED SEPTEM A LIBIT LAY WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO REPAIR A DEVIATED SEPTM WITH OUT SURGERY CAUSE THAT ACTUALLY AS POSSIBLE IN MANY NOT ALL CASES AND IS EIMMENSELY BENEFICIAL TO DO BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT BREATHING IN THROUGH THE NOSE IS A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND ITS SPOSED TO BE A LITTLE BIT HARDER HOWEVER BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER BECAUSE THERE'S MORE RESISTNCE AS WE SAY YOU ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO DRAW MORE FORCE INTO THESE MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF THE BREATHING APPARATUS AND ACTUALLY BRING MORE AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS YOU CAN TRY THIS RIGHT NOW TRY BREATHING IN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH TO MAXIMALLY IN FLATE YOUR LUNGS AND TRY AND DO IT THROUGH MOSTLY DIAPHRMATIC BREATHING JUST FOR SAKE OF EXAMPLE IN OTHER WORDS TRYIG BREATHIN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH AND AS YOU DO THAT HAVE YOUR BELLY EXPAND AND MAXIMILLY INFLATE YOUR LUNGS I'LL DO WHAT RIGHT NOW WITH YOU SO THAT WE CAN DO IT IN ATOGETHER AND I CAN PROVE ATEVERY ONE THAT I'M JUST AS DEFICIENT IN THIS AS YOU ARE O CASE I CAN INFLATE MY STOMACH DOING THAT BUT NOW TRY DOING IT WITH YOUR NOSE AND PLEASE DO AXHAIL BEFORE YOU TRY TOING T WITH YOUR NOSE WITH YOUR NOSE YOU'RE GING TO FEEL MORE RESISTANCE BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YOU CAN INFLATE IT QUITE A BIT FURTHER AND YOU'LL FEEL YOUR INTIRE CAVITY YOUR YOUR BELLY AND MAYBEVEN IN YOUR LOWER BACK SO FILL WITH SOME PRESSURE SO THE INCREASED RESISTANCE ACTUALLY ALOWS YOU TO DRAW MORE AIR INTO THE SYSTEM THIS TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND IT ALSO WIPES AWAY A COMMON MIS S CONCEPTION WHICH IS IF YOUR SOMEBODY HAS A CHALLENGES BREATHING IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE THAT SOMEHOW YOU SHOULD AVOID BREATHING IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE AND WE CAN GO A STEP FURTHER AND SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE CHALLENGES BREATHING IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE CHANCES ARE THAT'S BECAUSE THE INCREASED RESISTANCE OF BREATHING IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE PROVIDED ITS NOT COMPLETELY ECLUDED IS GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO BRING MORE OXYGEN INTO YOUR SYSTEM THIS WILL TURN OUT TO BE USEFUL LATER WHEN WE EXPLORE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES FOR INSTANCE NOT JUST TO CALM DOWN QUICKLY BUT TO ELEVATE YOUR ENERGY QUICKLY TO I REMOVE A CRAMP DURING EXERCISE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT BREATHIN CAN BE USED FOR THAT CAN BE IMMENSELY USEFUL FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CHALLENGES I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS IVE BEEN TAKING ATHLTIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MUN SYSTEM AND BASICALY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACKT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURN HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS ENATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGENS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL F MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTESCRIPE IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIND THAT'S TATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY A VITEMIND THREE K TO SONOLAS TALK ABOUT THE CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING AND THE TWO MAJOR PLAYERS IN THIS DISCUSSION ARE OXYGEN WHICH ALL THE CELLS AND TISSUES OF YOUR BODY NEED AND CARBONDIOXIDE WHICH ALL THE CELLS AN TISSUES OF YOUR BODY NEED IN FACT CARBONDOXIDE PLAYS CRITICAL ROLLS IN DELIVERING OXYGEN TO YOUR CELLS AND WITHOUT CARBONDOXIDE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ENOUGH OXYGEN TO THE CELLS AND TISSUES OF YOUR BODY THAT SAID IF CARBONDOXIDE LEVELS ARE TO HIGH THAT IS VERY PROBLEMATIC IN FACT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT ONE CAN RELIABLY IN DUCE PANIC IN ANYBODY IS TO HAVE THEM BREATHE EIR THAT CONTAINS TOO MUCH CARBONDOXIDE SO MUCH SO THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT LACK A SO CALLED A MIGDOLA MANY OF YOU VE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE IMIGOLA THIS IS A BRAIN AREA THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH FEAR AND THREAT DETECTION EVEN IN PEOPLE WHO COMPLETELY LACK A MIGDOLAS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN BECAUSE THEY WERE REMOVED BECAUS TEY HAD EPOLOPTIC SEISURES THERE AND THEREFORE THOSE PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY UNAFRAID OF THINGS THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE AFRAID OF LIKE HEIGHTS POISONOUS SNAKES ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS DANGEROUS TO HUMANS WELL IF THOSE PEOPLE BREATHE AND EXCESS AMOUNT OF CARBONDOXIDE THEY IMMEDIATELY HAVE A PANIC ATTACK WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THAT AGAIN THERE ARE PARALEL MECHANISMS THERE'S REDUNDANCY IN THE SYSTEM TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM HAVING TOO MUCH CARBONDOXIDE IN OUR SYSTEM SO WE NEED ENOUGH CARBONDOIDE AND ENOUGH OXYGEN IN OUR SYSTEM BUT NOT TOO MUCH THE WAY THAT'S ACCOMPLISHED IS THAT OF COURSE WE BREATHE IN AIR ARE LUNGS IN FLIGHT AND IF YOU RECALL THOSE LITTLE AVIOLY OF THE LUNGS THOSE LITTLE SACKS OXYGEN CAN ACTUALLY MOVE FROM THE AIR INTO THOSE LITTLE SACKS AND THEN FROM THOSE LITTLE SACKS INTO THE VAXCULATURE THE VASCULATURE ARE THE CAPOLARIES THE VEINS AND THE ARTERIES OF THE BODY BECAUSE THE WALLS OF THOSE LITTLE AVIOLI ARE EXCEEDINGLY THIN AND THEY HAVE TONS OF LITTLE CAPALARIES THAT GO INTO THEM AND ARE ALL AROUND THEM SO THIS IS AMAZING RIGH THEIS OXYGEN LITERALLY PASSING FROM INSIDE OF THESE LITTLE SACKSON OUR LUNGS AS WE INHAILED THE OXYGEN FROM THE AIR INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND THEN THAT OXYGEN GETS BOUND UP BY PROTINES IN THE BLOOD IN PARTICULAR HEMOGLOBIN AND HEMOGLOB AN THEN DHELIVERS OXYGEN TO THE VERY CELLS AND TISSUES OF THE BODY HOWEVER OXYGEN CAN'T JUST HOP ON HEMOGLOBE IN AND CRUISE ALONG WITH HEMOGLOBIN UNTIL IT GETS TO SAY YOUR BRAIN AND THEN HOP OFF DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY YOU REQUIRE CARBONDIOXIDE IN ORDER TO LIBERATE OXYGEN FROM HEMOGLOBIN CARBONDOXIDE HAS THITS INCREDIBLE PROPERTY OF AXY BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE SHAPE OF HEMOGLOBAND HEMOGLOBIN IS CHAPE IS A SORT OF A CAGE AROUND OXYGEN MOLECULES AND WHEN IT'S IN THAT CAGE SHAPE TE OXYGEN CAN'T BE LIBERATED SO YOU'VE GOT OXYGEN AND HEMOGLOBAN BOUND TO ONE ANOTHER MOVING THROUGH YOUR BLOOD STREAM BUT IF A TISSUE NEEDS OXYGEN THERE NEEDS TO BE CARBONDOXIDE PRESENT TO OPEN UP THAT CAGE AND THAT'S WHAT CARBONDOXIDE DOES IT ALLOWS THAT CGE SHOU CHANGE SHAPE AND THEN THE OXYGEN CAN BE LIBERATED AND THEN CAN BE DELIVERED TO THE TISSUES WHETHER NOT THAT SPRAIN TISSUE OR MUSCLE TISSUE SO ON AND SO FORTH AND SO THOSE OF THE MAGOR CHEMICAL COMPONENTS OF BREATHING THERE ARE FEW OTHER APECS RELATED TO THE CHEMICAL COMPONES OF BREATHING SUCH AS THE FACT THAT CARBONDIOXIDE IS STRONGLY RELATED TO HOW AIDIC OR HOW BASIC YOUR BODY IS IN GENERAL SO FOR INSTANCE IF CARBONDOXIDE LEVELS GO WEIGHE DOWN YOUR BLOOD P H GOES WAY UP THAT IS YOU BECOME MORE ALKALINE NOW FOR MANY PEOPLE THE WORD P H AND THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF P H IMMEDIATELY STARTS TO A VOKE ANXIETY AND ANOF ITSELF A P H IS ACUY VERY SIMPLE YOU WANT THE BODY BASICALLY TO B AT A P H OF ABOUT SEVEN POINT FOR THE ARE SOME REGIONS OF YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR ALONG THE GUT WHICH THAT NUMBER IS IMPORTANTLY DIFFERENT IN ORDER FOR DIGESTION TO WORK PROPERLY YOU'VE ALL HEAR THE GUT MICROBYUM THE LITTLE MICROBES THAT PROVIDED YOU HAVE A NOUGH OF THEM AN THEIR DIVERSE ENOUGH ALLOW YOUR BRAIN AND BODY TO FUNCTION OPTIMALLY AT THE LEVEL OF MIUN SYSTEM HORMON SYSTEM BRAIN ET CETERA WELL IN THE GUT YOU WANT THE P H SOMETIMES BE SLIGHTLY MORE ACITIC BECAUSE WHEN IT'S MORE ACITIC THE LITTLEL MICROBIOTA FLOURISH FAR MORE THAN IF IT WERE MORE BASIC BUT BASILY YOU WANT THE REST OF THE BODY TO BE AT ABOUT P H SEVEN POINT FOR IF CARBONDIOXIDE LEVELS GO TOO LOW THE P H INCREASES IN A WAY THAT YOU MIGHT SAY OWHELE THAT'S BAD BUT THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS MORE OXYGEN TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE TISSUES OF YOUR BODY AT LEAST TEMPORARILY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS A BIT MORE LATER IF I'M LOSING ANY OF YIOU JUST HANGING THERE BECAUSE WE'RE ALMOST DONE WITH THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF THE MECHANICS AND THE CHEMISTRY OF BREATHING ANDTHAN WE CAN GET INTO THE TOOLS AND REVISIT SOME OF THIS LATER TO CLEAN UP ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS IT MAY HAVE ARISEN BUT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CARBONDOXIDE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND HOW KEY IT IS TO HAVE CARBONOXIDE AND THE PROMISE WITH IT GOING TO HIGHER TOO LOW YOU SHOULDPROBABLY BE ASKING YOURSELF WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES CARBONOXIDE GO TOO LOW RIGHT WE KNOW THT WE BREATHE IN OXYGEN AND THEN IT CAN PASS FROM THE LUNGS AND THE EVIOLY INTO THE BLOOD STREAM ANDTHAT WE NEED CARBONOXIDE DELIBERATE OXYGEN FROM THE HEMOGLOBON INTO THE SELLS AND TISSUES F THE BODY AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE EXHAL OR ITUALLY I HAVE TOLD YOU THIS YET BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WHEN YOU EXHAL CARBONDIOXIDE IS ACTUALLY TAKEN FROM THE BLOOD STREAM BACK INTO THESE AVIOLY OF THE LONGS AND THEN WHEN YOU EXHAL IT'S EXPELLED THROUGH YOUR MOUTH OR THROUGHYOUR NOSE OUT INTO THE WORLD SO THE WAY I JUST DESCRIBED ALL THAT INHAL BRING IN OXYGEN EXHAL EXPEL CARBONDIOXIDE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD RIGHT INDEED IT IS AND IT ALSO TELLS YOU THAT WERE YOU TO EXHAIL A LOT MORE OR A LOT MORE VIGOROUSLY YOU WOULD EXPEL MORE CARBONDIOXIDE AND IN FACT THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY AT WORKS WHEN YOU HYPER VENTILATE OF COURSE YOU ARE INHALING MORE THAN USUAL BUT YOU ARE ALSO EXHALING MORE THAN USUAL SO YOU ARE OF COURSE BRINGING IN MORE AIR AND OXYGEN TO YOUR BODY BUT YOU'RE ALSO REMOVING MORE CARBONDOXIDE FROM YOUR BODY THAN NORMAL CARBONDIOXIDE BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT IT REGULATES BRAIN STATE IN FACT THE WAY IN WHICH IT REGULATES THE EXCITABILITY LITERALLY THE ABILITY OF YOUR NURONS TO ENGAGE ELECTRICALLY OR NOT IT CAN CREATE STATES OF PANIC AND ANXIETY WHICH IS WHY WHEN YOU HYPER VENTILATE YOU FEEL AN INCREASE IN ANXIETY OR WHEN YOU FEEL AN INCREASE IN ANXIETY YOU HYPER VENTILAE IT'S A RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP IN FACT I DON'T WANT ANYONE WHO HAS ANXIETY OR WHO HAS PANIC ATTACKS TO TRY THIS NOW BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S PROBABLY SAFE AS LONG S YOU'RENOT DRIVING OR DOING SOMETHING MECHANICAL OR OPERING MACHINERY THAT IS PROBABLY SAFE TO DO TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY DEEP INHALS AND EXHAILS AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT BY ABOUT BREATH TEN YOU'LL START TO FEEL TINGALY AND YOU'LL PROBABLY FEEL LILL BIT MORE ALERT AND AGAIN IF YOU HAVE ANXIETY OR PANIC ATTACK TENDENCIES PLEASE DON'T DO THIS BUT YOU WILL FEEL AN INCREASE IN SO CALLED AUTONOMIC ARALSAL IN INCREASING THE ACTIVITY FOR OVER ALL SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH HAS NOTHING TO A SYMPATHY AS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ALERTNESS YOULL ACTUALLY DEPLOY A DRENLINE FROM YOUR DRENALS SILL JUST DO THIS NOW YOU CAN TRY THIS NOW AGAIN PROVIDED YOURE IN A SAFE PLACE ANDYOU DON'T HAVE ANXIETY OUR PENICATAC TENDENCIES YOU WIULL JUST BREATHIN THROUGHR NOSE AND OUTH THROUGH YOUR MOUTH T REMEMBER WERE BREATHING IN MORE AND MORE VIGOROUSLY AND WERE EXHAILING MORE AND MORE VIGOROUSLY THAN WE NORMALLY WOULD IT GOS SOMETHING LIKE THIS NOW BY BREATH EIGHT OR NINE OR TEN YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YUR BODY STARTS A HEAT UP THAT'S DUE TO A COUPLE OF THINGS TA MAINLY THE RELEASE OF A DRENLINE FROM YOUR DRENALS I AM ALREADY FEELING IL BIT LIGHTHEADED THE LIGHTHEADEDNESS IS OXUALLY BECAUSE YOUR VASCULATURE THE CAPLARIES IN VEINS AND TO SOME EXTEND EVEN THE ARTERIES OF YOUR BODY IN PARTICULARING YOUR BRAIN ARE ACTUALLY STRARTING TO CONSTRICTS TO YOUR CUTTING OFF BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN WHY WELL BECAUSE CARBON DIOXIDE ACTUALLY IS OF VAZO DILATOR NORMALLY IT EXISTS IN YOUR BODY TO KEEP CAPLARYES VEINS AND ARTERIES DILATED TO ALLOW BLOOD TO PASS THROUGH THEM WHEN YOU HYPER VENTILATE SURE YOUR BRINGING IN A LOT OF OXYGEN WHICH YOU THINK WOULD MAKE YOU MORE ALERT AND INDEED IT DOES BUT YOU ARE ALSO EXPELLING A LOT MORE CARBONDOXIDE THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD AND THAT'S CAUSING SOME VAZO CONSTRICTION IN YOUR IN A START FEELING TINGLY IN THE PERIFERY IN YOUR FINGERS AND TOES PERHAPS OR YOUR LEGS YOU WILL ALSO NOTICE THAT YOUR FEELING MORE ALERT IN THE BRAIN BUT THAT YOU MIGHT START TO FEEL A BIT OF ANXIETY SO HYPERVENTILATION YESPRINGS IN MORE OXYGEN ALSO REMOVES MORE CARBONDOXIDE THE REMOVAL OF EXCESS CARBONDIOXIDE PUTS YOU INTO A STATE THAT'S CALLED HYPOCAPNIC RIGHT HYPOXIA HYPOXIA IS REDUCED LEVELS OF OXYGEN RELATIVE TO NORMAL HYPOCAPNIA IS REDUCED LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE RELATIVE TO NORMAL AND IS THOSE REDUCED LEVELS OF CARBONDOXIDE THAT ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ELEVATION IND ENERGY AND AT THE SAME TIME A FEELING OF A BIT OF ANXIETY THE CONSTRICTION OF THE MICROVAXCULATURE IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND THEREFORE THE FEELINGS OF BEING KIND OF TINGLY AND HAVING KIND OF AN URGENCY TO MOVE O CASE SO BY NOW IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE NEED BOTH OXYGEN AND  CARBONDIOXIDE AND ACROSS THE COURSE OF THIS EPISODE I WILL EXPLAIN HOW TO ADJUST THOSE RATIOES OF OXYGEN TO CARBONDOXIDE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR IMMEDIATE NEEDS ARE AND WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO NEXT WITHOR NOT THAT SLEEP OR EXERCISE OR MENTAL WORK ET CETERA BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER HOWEVER THERE IS SOMETHING I WANT TO TOUCH ON BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH NOT EVERYONE WILL EXPERIENCE THIS I THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IT THAT IT IS OF INTEREST AND NOWS THE RIGHT TIME TO TOUCH IN TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO UP TO A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE MEANING WHYAT'S HARD TO BREATHE WHEN YOU GET UP TO HIGH ALTITUDES SO IF YOU'RE CLOSE TO SEA LEVEL YOU ARE GETTING  THE OPTABLE BALANCE OF OXYGEN IN THE ER YOU BREATHE AS YOU ASCEND IN ALTITUDE SOLICY YOU GO TO SIX THOUSAND FEET OR TEN THOUSAND MAY YOUIN ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOV SEE LEVEL OR MAYBE YOU ONE OF THOSE RAR INDIVIDUALS THAT CLIMBS DENOLY OR YOU CLIMB MOUNT EVERIST AND YOU GET UP THERE ANDYOU NOTICE IT YOU MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WEAR AN OXYGEN MASK WHY IS IT THAT YOU NEED AN OXYGEN MASK AT THOSE VERY HIGH ALTITUDES OR WHEN PEOPLE DO THESE VERY HIGH ALTITUDE SKYH DIVES THAT THEY NEED OXYGEN A WAY UP HIGH WELL A LOT PEOPLE SAY OH THERE'S NOT MUCH OXYGEN UP THERE YOU KNOW THE AIR IS THINNER LOOKAY WELL PERHAPS A BETTER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING AND THE FACT THAT THE LUNGS DON'T REALLY MOVE THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAVE THE MUSCLES THE DIAPHRAME AN INTERCOSTA MUSCLES TO MOVE THEM WELL A LOT OF THE REASON WHY YOUR LUNGS CAN FILL SO READILY WITH AIR IS THAT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH AIR IN YOUR LUNGS THERE'S VERY LOW AIR PRESSURE IN YOUR LUNGS RELATIVE TO OUTSIDE YOU  SO WHAT WE MEAN THEN IS IF YOU WERE TO OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH OR YOUR NOSE AND BREATHE IN THAT IS BREATHIN THROUGH YOUR NOSE OR MOUTH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS AIR IS GOING TO MOVE FROM HIGH PRESSURE TO LOW PRESSURE SO IT'S VERY EASY TO FILL YOUR LUNGS EVEN THOUGH YOU NEED THOSE MUSCLES TO MOVE THE VARIOUS THINGS AROUND THAT ALLOW YOUR LUNGS TO FILL THE AIR IS GOING TO GO FROM HIGH PRESSURE TO LOW PRESSURE SO FOR THOSE YOU LISTEN AGUSTOCABEEN BIG INHAIL THROUGH MY NOSE AND THEN WHN YOU EXTAIL RIGHT YOU'RE BASICALLY TAKING THE LUNGS FROM A STATE IN WHICH THE PRESSURE IS REALLY HIGH IN THE LUNGS YOU HIGH PRESSURE LIKE THE BALLOON THAT'S FULL AND THE PRESSURE IN YOUR LUNGS WHEN YOUR LUNGS ARE FULL IS HIGHER THAN THE AIR OUTSIDE SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO EXPEL THAT AIR THROUGH THE NOSE OR MOUTH WHEN YOU'RE A HIGH ALTITUDES THE AIR PRESSURE IS LOWER AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THE AIR PRESSURE IS LOWER OUTSIDE YOUR BODY AND YOUR LUNGS ARE NOT FULL OF AIR YOU DON'TO HAVE THAT REALLY STEEP GRADIANT OF HIGH PRESSURE OUTSIDE THE BODY TO LOW PRESSURE INSIDE YOUR LUNGS AND SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUT A LOT MORE EFFORT INTO BREATHING AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS YOU HAVE TO REALLY EXERT A LOT OF FORCE YOUHAVE TO GET THE DIAPHRAME THOSE INTERCOSTALE MUSCLES WORKING REALLY HARD YOU MIGHT EVEN FIND THAT YOUR SHOULDERS ARE LIFTING WITH EACH BREATH AS YOU REALLY HAVE TO GENERATE A LOT OF FORCE TO GET ENOUGH AIR AN OXYGEN INTO YOUR LUNGS NOW AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IN HUMANS AND IN SOME OTHER SPECIES BUT REALLY WHAT WEREK TALKNG ABOUT NOW AS HUMANS WHEN YOU INHALE THAT'S AN ACTIVE PROCESS YOU REALLY NEED TO USE THOSE MUSCLES OF THE INTERCOSTALES AN THE DIAPHRAME IN ORDER TO INFLATE THE LUNGS BUT THE WHOLE PROCESS IS MADE EASIER WHEN AIR PRESSURE OUTSIDE YOUR BODY IS HIGHER THAN IT IS IN YOUR LUNGS BECAUSE THEN THEY'RE GOIG TO FILL UP REALLY READILY EXHALING AT LEAST FOR HUMANS IS A PASSIVE THING YOU JUST HAVE TO RELAX THE DIAPHRAME IN RELAX THE INTERCOSTALES AND LET THE RIBCAGEION FALL BACK TO ITS IN ORIGINAL POSITION SO INHALING IS ACTIVE AND EXHAILING IS PASSIVE AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE'VEYOU'RE AT A HIGH ALTITUDE AND THE AIR PRESSURE IS VERY LOW THEN YOU OUGH TO PUT A LOT OF ENERGY INTO BREATHING AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS TO GET AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF OXYGEN INTO YOUR LUNGS AND THEN INTO THE BLOOD STREAM SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT A HIGH ALTITUDE LOCATION FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS YOU CAN FEEL LIGHTHEADED MAY BE A HEADACHE YOU ALSO CAN HAVE MORE BUILD UP OF CARBONIE OXIDE IN YOUR SYSTEM AND SO THE WHOLE BALANCE OF OXYGEN AND CARBONDOXIDE IS GOING TO BE DISTRUPTED I MENTION ALL THAT BECAUSE YES INDEED THERE ARE SOME CHANGES IN THE ATMOSPHERIC GASES THAT HIGH ALTITUDES AND I THAT CAN IMPACT HOW MUCH OXYGEN YOU CAN BRING INTO YOUR SYSTEM ANT YOUR TISSUES BUT NOW IHAVE HEARD MANY EXPLANATIONS OF WHYIT'S HARD TO BREATHE OR WHY YOU FEEL LALSY AT ALTITUDE WELL YOU JUST DISCOVERED ONE REASON WHICH IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT STEEP HIGH PRESSURE TO LOW PRESSURE GRADIENT FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY INTO THE INSIDE OF THE BODY THE CONVERSE IS ALSO TRUE IF YOU'VE BEEN AT ALTITUDE FOR A FEW DAYS AND YOU'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADJUST A LOT OF ATHLETES FOR INSTANCE WILL GO TRAIN AT ALTITUDE IT'S HARD FOR THEM IN THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS AND THEN THEY GET REALLY GOOD AT TRAINING AT ALTITUDE THEREAR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS THAT OCCUR IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN THAT CAN BE CARRIED IN THE BLOOD BY HEMOGLOBIN AND THE INNER AXIONS BETIN CARBONDOXIDE AND HEMO GLOBAN AN OXYGEN THAT ALLOW MORE OXYGEN TO BE DELIVERED TO THE TISSUDES SUCH THAT AT ALTITUDE YOU CAN FUNCTION JUST NORMALLY BUT IF YOU THEN MOVE VERY QUICKLY FROM ALTITUDE SAT YOU'VEBEEN TRAINING AT EIGHT THOUSAND FEET OR TEN THOUSAND FEET YOU BEEN HIGHKING UP AT THET HIGH LEVEL AN YOU'VE ADAPTED AND YOU COME DOWN TO SEA LEVEL WELL FOR ABOUT TWO TO FIVE DAYS YOU'RE GING TO FEEL LIKE AN ABSOLUTE BEAST YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY DELIVER FAR MORE OXYGEN TO YOUR MUSCLES PUR BREATH INPART THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE HEMOGLOBIN AND THE OXYGEN THAT IT'S CARRYING HAS BEEN ALTERED WHEN YOU ARE AT HIGH ALTITUDE BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE AT THA HIGH ALTITUDE THOSE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES AND THOSE DIAPHRANS GOT TRAINED UP QUITE A BIT AND ALLOWED YOU TO GENERATE MORE AIR VOLUME FOR EVERY BREATH AND OTHER WORDS THOSE MUSCLES GOT STRONGER AND YOU GOT MORE EFFICIENT AT DRIVING THE FRENIC NERVE CONSCIOUSLY TO REALLY BREATHIN A LOT OF OXYGEN SO YOU DON'T FEEL LIGHT HEADED HEADACHE ET CETERA HAS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF IN ASIDE BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ASIDE I BELIEVE BECAUSE AID ANSWERS A QUESTION A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK AND THE LOP YOU'LL WONDER ABOUT AND BE BECAUSE IT CORPORATES BOTH THE MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING AND THE CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING I REALISE IT'S A LOW BIT OF A UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE BUT NOW IF ANY ONE ASK YOU WHY IT'S HARD TO BREAH AT ALTITUDE YOU KNOW HAS TO DO WITH THIS LACK OF A HIGH PRESSURE TO LOW PRESSURE GRADIENT UM ACROSS THE BODY IN WITH THE THE ATMOSPHERE OUTSIDE YOU IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SAY THAT IF YOU DO FIND YOURSELF AT ALTITUDE YOU HAVE A HEADACHE ARE YOUE FEELING LIKE YOUE JUST CAN'T CATCH YOUR BREATH SPENDING SOME TIME REALLY CONSCIOUSLY TRYING TO DRAW IN LARGER BREATHS OF AIR AS MUCH AS THAT MIGHT SEEM FATIGUING AND YOU'LL BE SHORT OF BREATH IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO ADAPT MORE QUICKLY AND LI BIT LATER IN THE EPISODE WILL TOUCH ON A FEW METHODS INCLUDING DELIBERATE HIGH PEREVENTILATION COMBINE WITH SOME BREATHHOLDS THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO D DELIVER MORE OXYGEN TO THE CELLS IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVING AT ALTITUDES OET DN'T GET QUITE AS MUCH HEADACHE DISORIENTATION AND SO ON SO LEAVING BREATHING AT ALTITUDE ASIDE LAT'S ALL COME BACK DOWN TO THE SAME CONCEPTIUAL LEVEL WE CAN ASK OURSELVES FOR INSTANCE WHAT IS HEALTHY BREATHING AND WHAT IS UNHALTHY BREATHING AND T HE FIRST PLACE WE WANT TA TACKL THIS IS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SLEEP SO WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WE CONTINUE TO BREATHE THAT'S NO SURPRISE IF WE DIDN'T WE WOULD DIE DURING SLEEP HOWEVER THERE IS A LARGE FRACTION OF THE POPULATION THAT UNDER BREATHES DURING SLEEP THEY'RE NOT TAKING DEEP ENOUGH OR FREQUENT ENOUGH BREATHS AND THEREFORE THEY ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT'S CALLED SLEEP APNIA THEY ARE BECOMING HIGH POXIC HYPO OXIC THERE'S LESS OXYGEN BEING BROUGHT IN TO THEIR SYSTEM THAN IS NECESSARY PEOPLE THAT ARE CARRYING EXCESS WATE EITHER FAT WEIGHT OR MUSCLE WEIGHT OR BOTH ARE MORE PRONE TO NIGHTTIME SLEEP APNIA HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT OVER WEIGHT WHO ALSO EXPERIENCE SLEEP APNIA HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR EXPERIENCING SLEEP APNIA WILL FIRST OF ALL EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS AND EXCESSIVE DAYTIME ANXIETY COMBINED WITH DAYTIME SLEEPINESS IS ONE SIGN TAT YOU MIGHT BE SUFFERING FROM SLEEP APHNIA YOUR THING IS IF YOU HAPPEN TO SNORE IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING SLEEP APNIA AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT SLEEP APNIA IS A VERY SERIOUS HEALTH CONCERN IT GREATLY INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF A CARTY OF ASCULAR EVENT HART ATTACK STROKE IT IS A PRECURSIR OR SOMETIMES THE DIRECT CAUSE OF SEXUAL DISFUNCTION IN MAILS AND FEMALES COGNITIVE DISFUNCTION DURING THE DAYTIME IT CAN EXASPERBATE THE EFFECTS OF DEMENSHA WHETHER NOT AGE RELATED DIMENSIO OF THE NORMAL SORT OR ALCIMER'S TYPE DIMENSIA WHICH IS AN ACCELERATION OF AG RELY COGNIVE DECLINE IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHOHAS HAD A DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY IF YOUR EXPERIENCE IN A LOT OF STRESS SLEEP APNIAS GOING TO GREATLY DISRRUPT THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN BROUGHT INS YOUR BRAIN AN BODY DURING SLEEP AND IS GOING TO LEAD TO A NUMBER OF NIGHTTIME AND DAYTIME ISSUES SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND WILL GET INTO THIS A BIT MORE LATER BUT SINCE I RAISED IT AS A PROBLEM I DO ONE TO RAISE THE SOLUTION ONE OF THE MAJOR TREATMENTS FOR SLEEP APNIAS THAT PEOPLE GET A SEEP HAP DEVICE WHICH IS AS AM FACE MASK IN A MACHINE THAT THEY'LL SLEEP WITH AND WHILE THOSE CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE NOT EVERYONE NEEDS A SEEP HAP ONE OF THE MORE COMMON METHODS NOWADAYS THAT'S BEING USED TO TREAT SLEEP APNIA WHICH IS PURELY BEHAVIORABL IN INTERVENTION AND IS ESSENTIALLY ZERO COST IS THAT PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SHIFT DELIBERATELY TO NASAL BREATHING DURING SLEEP BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL RESISTANCE OF NASAL BREATHING AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S FAR LESS TENDENCY IF ANY IF ANY SCUSE ME TO SNORE WHEN NASAL BREATHING TAPING THE MAUSHUT USING MEDICAL TAPE PRIOR TO SLEEP EXCUSE ME PUTTING MEDICAL TYPE ON THE MOUTH PRIOR TO GOING TO SLEEP AND THEN SLEEPING ALL NIGHT WITH MEDICAL TAPE ON THE MOUTH IS ONE WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN LEARN TO NASAL BREATHE DURING SLEEP AND CAN GREATLY OFFSET A LOT OF SLEEP APNIA SNORING AND SLEEP RELATED ISSUES NUMBER PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO OR DON'T FEEL SAFE PUTTING MEDICAL TAPE ON THEIR MOUTH PRIOR TO SLEEP FOR SOME REASON THEY THINK THEY'RE GIN A SUFFOCATE BUT OF COURSE YOU WOULD WAKE UP IF YOU START TO RUN OUT OF AIR A AT ANY MOMENT SO THAT'S NOT SO MUCH TO CONCERN BUT WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY WILL START TO USE PURE NASAL BREATHING DURING ANY TYPE OF EXERCISE OR EVEN JUST FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME WAL KING DURING THE DAY OR WHILE WORKING AND AGAIN LATER WILL GET INTO THE ENORMOUS BENEFITS OF SHIFTING TO PURE NASAL BREATHING WHEN NOT EXERCISING HARD MEANING AT A RATE THAT YOU COULD NORMALLY HOLD A CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH IF YOUR PUR NASAL BREATHING YOU WON'T BE HOLDING THAT CONVERSATION OR WHEN SIMPLY DOING WORK OR ON ANY NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE  LOW INTENSITY YOU CAN TRAIN YOUR SYSTEM TO BECOME A BED OR NASAL BREATHER DURING THE DAYTIME THROUGH THESE DELIBERATE ACTIONS OF TAKPING THE MOUTHSHUTTER JUST BEING CONSCIOUS OF KEEPING YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND THAT IN ADDITION HAVING A NUMBER OF POSITIVE HEALTH AND AESTHETIC EFFECTS DURING THE DAYTIME IS KNOWN TO ALL SO TRANSFER TO NIGHT TIME BREATHING PATTERNS AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO BECOME NASAL BREATHERS AS SUPPOSED TO MOUTH BREATHERS DURING SLEEP AND TO SNORE LESS AND TO HAVE LESS SLEEP APNEA AGAIN IF YOU HAVE SEVERE SLEEP APNA YOU PROUBLY DUNY TO CHECK OUT A A SLEEP A SEA PAP YOU SHOULD TALK YOUR PHYSITION BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MINOR SLEEP APNEA OR SLEEP APNIA THATS STARTING TO TAKE HOLD O THESE OTHER METHODS OF SHIFTING TO BECOMING A NAZAL BREATHER ARE GOING TO BE FAR MORE BENEFICIAL AND FARMOR COST EFFECTIVE THEN GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE SEE PAP WHICH BY THE WAY DOESN'T REALLY TEACH YOU HOW TO BREATHE PROPERLY AS MUCH AS IT DOES A JUST THE AIR FLOW GOING INTO YOUR SYSTEM THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT WHEN YOU SHIFT FROM MOUTH TO NAZAL BREATHING DURING SLEEP YOUR ACTUALLY LEARNING AND TRAINING YOUR SYSTEM TO BREATHE PROPERLY AND WHEN I SAY LEARNING AND TRAINING YOUR SYSTEM TO BREATHE PROPERLY WHAT DO I MEAN LET'S PUT SOME SCIENTIFIC AND MECHANISTIC MEET ON THAT WE ALREADY TALKS ABOUT THE FRENIC NERVE THIS NERVE THAT INTERVATES THE DIAPHRAM IN THAT ALLOWS FOR THE LONGS TO FILL UP BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENT IN THE DIAPHRAM WHAT WE DID TALK ABOUT HOWEVER WHERE THE BRAIN CENTERS THAT ACTUALLY CONTROL THE FHRENIC NERVE AND CONTROL BREATHING KNOWING ABOUT THESE TWO BRAIN AREAS AND WHAT THEY DO IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CONTENT OF THIS EPISODE BUT FOR UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT WILL DISCUSS AND INDEED YOUR GENERAL HEALTH AS IT RELATES TO RESPIRATION SO THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL BREATHING THE FIRST IS CALLED THE PREBUTSING OR COMPLEX YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE NAME SO MUCH JUST KNOW THAT IT WAS NAMED AFTER A BOTTLE OF WINE AND THAT IT WAS DISCOVERED BY THE GREAT JACK FELDMAN WHOS A PROFESSOR OF NER SCIENCE HAT THE UNIVERSIY CALIFORNIA LOSTS ANGELIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERIES AND ALL OF NERO SCIENCE AND LLAST HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE BECAUSE THIS BRAIN AREA THAT JACK AND HIS COLLEAGUES DISCOVERED CONTROLS ALL ASPECTS OF BREATHING THAT ARE RHYTHMIC THAT IS WHEN INHALES FOLLOW EXALS FOLLOW INHALES FOLLOW EXALES THAT'S ALL CONTROLL BY A SMALL SET OF NERONS IN THIS BRAINSTEM AREAS ON THE IN ROUND THE REGION OF THE NECK CALL THE PREBUTSING OR COMPLEX AND WE REALLY OWE A DEAT OF GRATITUDE TO JACK AND HIS COLLEAGUES FOR DISCOVERING THAT AREA BECAUSE IT'S INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING FROM BREATHING WHEN WE'RE ASLEEP TO BREATHING WHEN WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT OUR BREATHING IT MAY HAVE A ROLL IN THAT IS WHEN IT'S FUNCTION IS DISRUPTED IT MAY CAUSE THINGS LIKE SUDDEN INFANDESTHS IN DRUM BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT CAN EXPLAIN IN LARGE PART MANY OF THE DEATHS RELATED TO THE OPIOID CRISIS BECAUSE EXOGION IS OPIOIDS LIKE FENTINEL AND OTHER SORTS OF DRUGS WHICH ARE OPIOIDS OBVIOUSLY BIND TO OPOID RECEPTERS ON THAT STRUCTURE AND SHUT IT DOWN NOW KEEP IN MIND THESE NURONS ARE DESIGNED TO BE INCREDIBLY ROBUST AND ARE DESIGNED TO FIRE INHALE EXHALE INHALE EXHALE NO MATTER IF WE'RE AWAKE OR AWARE UNAWARE OR SLEEP TO KEEP US ALIVE EXOCON IS OPIOIDS LIKE FENTINEL AND DRUGS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THAT CAN SHUT DOWN THAT STRUCTURE BECAUSE IT'S RICH WITH THESE OPIOID RECEPTERS ISTO IT BINDS TO THAT AND IT SHUTS OFF THE PREBUTSINGER COMPLEX WHICH IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH OF PEOPLE WHO DIE FROM OPIOID OVERDOSES THE YULOPUL DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY THING OTHE OPODS MUST SHUT OFF THE BRAIN OR SHUT DOWN THE HEART NOW IT SHUTS DOWN BREATHING SO JACK'S DISCOVERY THE NO DOUBT WILL LEAD TO SOME IMPORTANT THINGS AS IT RELATES TO ADDICTION AND A HOPLLY I THINK WE FRANKLY CAN EXPECT THAT IT'S ALSO GOING TO EVENTUALLY LEAD TO WAYS TO PREVENT DEATH THAT IN PEOPLE USING OPIOIDS OR OTHER TYPES OF DRUG MAY BE BY BLOCKING OPIOID RECEPTORS IN PREBOTSING OR COMPLEX USING THINGS LIKE NOW TREXONE ET CETERA IN ANY EVENT PREBUTSINGER COMPLEX IS CONTROLLING INHALE EXHALE INHALE EXHAILE PATTERNS OF BREATHING THE OTHER BRAIN CENTER CONTROLLING BREATHING AGAIN THROUGH THE FRENIC NERVE RIGHT IT ALL CONVERGES AND GOES OUT THROUGH THE FRENDING NERVE OF THESE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES IS THE SO CALLED PARIFACIAL NUCLEUS AND THE PARIFACIAL NUCLEUS IS INVOLVED IN PATTERNS OF BREATHING WHERE THERE IS NOT AN INHALE FOLLOWED BY EXHALE INHALE FOLLO BY EXAIL THAT IS IT'S NOT RHYTHMIC ONE THAN THE OTHER BUT RATHER WHERE THERE IS A DOUBLING UP OF INHALES ARE A DOUBLING UP OF EXHALES OR A DELIBERATE PAUSE IN BREATHING SO INHALE PAWS EXHALE PAWS INHALE PAWS EXHAL PAWS THIS SORT OF THING A LITTLEBUT LATER WILL TALK ABOUT A PATTERN OF BREATHING CALLED BOX BREATHING WHICH HAS O VERY SPECIFIC AND USEFUL APPLICATIONS IN PARTICULAR FOR ADJUSTING ANXIETY AND IN THAT CASE IT INVOLVES GOING FROM RHYTHMIC BREATHING OF INHALE INHALE INHALE EXHALE THAT IS RELYING ON THE PREBUTSING OR COMPLEX NERONS TO RELIANCE ON THE PARIFACIAL NEUCLEASNERONS AND BOX BREATHING JUST TO GIVE AWAY WHAT'S PROBABLY ALREADY OBVIOUS AS YOU INHALE HOLD EXHALE HOLD AND REPEAT AND THAT PATTERN OF BREATHING EVEN THOUGH IT'S RHYTHMIC IN NATURE BECAUSE INHALES PRECEDE EXHALES PRECED INHALES AN SO ON THERE'S A DELIBERATE BREATH HOLD INSERTED THERE SO ANY TIME WE'RE TAKING CONSCIOUS CONTROL OF OUR BREATHING THE PARIFACIAL NUCLEUS IS GETTING INVOLVED NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASSUME THE THE PARIFACIAL NUCLEUSIS THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH WE TAKE CONSCIOUS CONTROL OF OUR BREATHING WE CAN ALSO TAKE CONTROL OF THE PREBUTSINGER COMPLEX YOU CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW SO FERENCE AS YOU ARE BREATHING AN SOME SPECIFIC PATTERN NOL THAT UNLESS YOU'RE SPEAKING OR EATHING NO DOUBT IS GOING TO INVOLVE INHALES FOLLOWED BY EXHALES B YOU COULD FOR INSTANCE DECIDE THAT YES INHALES ARE ACTIVE AND EXHALES ARE PASSIVE BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE EXHALES ACTIVE AS WELL SO RATHER THAN JUST INHALE AND THEN LET YOUR LUNGS TO FLATE YOU COULD INHALE AND THEN FORCE THE AIR OUT THAT'S GOING TO REPRESENT A CONSCIOUS TAKING OVER OF CONTROL OF THE PREBUTSINGOR COMPLEX I SO THE REASON I'M GIVING THIS MECHANISTIC DETAIL IS A IT'S SUPERIMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE TOOLS RELATE TO BREATHING BE IT'S ICHALY A PRETTY SIMPLE SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH THE AREAS HAVE FANCY NAMES LIKE PREBUTING OR PARIFACIAL IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD RIGHT YOU HAVE ONE AIRA THAT CONTROLS RHYTHMIC BREATHING IN HELFOLLOWS EXELLS AND THE OTHER AREA WHICH GETS INVOLVED IN BREATHING ANY TIME YOU START DOUBLING UP ON IN HALS OR EXCELLS IN FACT THE PARIFACIAL NEW PLASE IS THE ONE THAT YOURE RELYING ON WHILE YOU SPEAK IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THE STILL GET ENOUGH OXYGEN IT'S ALSO THE ONE THAT YOU WILL USE IF YOU INCORPORATE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SILE OR BOX BREATHING AND FRANKLY MOST OF THE TIME YOUR USING BOTH OF THESE CIRCUTS OR THESE BRAIN SYSTEMS PARIFACIAL AND PREBUTSINGER IN PARALLEL AGAIND BIOLOGY LOVES PARALLEL SYSTEMS ESPECIALY FOR THINGS THAT ARE SO CRITICAL THAT IF WE DIDN'T DO THEM WE WOULD DIE LIKE BREATHING AND SO IT MAKE CENSE THAT WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT BRAIN STRUCTURES THAT CONTROL THIS SO NOW YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANICAL CONTROL OF BREATHING THAT IS THE DIFFERENT PARTS WITHIN THE PARTS LIST THAT INVOLVED IN BREATHING EVERYTHING FROM NOWS TO MAUTHTO AVIOLLY THE LUNGS ET CETERA AND THE MUSCLES INVOLVED IND MOVING THE LUNGS YOU UNDERSTAND I LIKE TO THINK A BIT ABOUT BRINGING OXYGEN IN AND REMOVING CARBONDOXIDE BUT NOT SO MUCH CARBONDOXIDE THAT YOU CAN'T ACTALLY USE THE OXYGEN THAT YOU HAVE AND YOU KNOW ABOUT TWO BRAIN CENTERS ONE CONTROLING RHYTHMIC BREATHING AND ONE THAT CONTROLS NON RHYTHMIC BREATHING I WANT TO REPEAT SOMETHING THAT I SAID ALOBIT EARLIER AS WELL WHICH IS THAT BREATHING IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN CONSCIOUS AND SUBCONSCIOUS CONTROL OVER YOUR NOT JUST BODY NOT JUST YOUR LUNGS BUT THAT HOW YOU BREATHE INFLUENCES YOUR BRAIN STATE SO BY USING YOUR BRAIN CONSCIOUSLY TO CONTROL YOUR BREATHING YOU ARE USING YOUR BRAIN TO CONTROL YOUR BRAIN THE BEST WAY I'VE EVER HEARD THIS DESCRIBED WAS FROM A BEAUTIFUL I SHOULD SAY NOW CLASSIC PAPER IN THE JOURNAL PHYSIOLOGY PUBLISH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FROM BALUSTRY KNOWN SUMGON WHERE THE FINAL LINE OF THEIR SUMMERY IN TRO STATES THE BRAIN BY REGULATING BREATHING CONTROLS ITS OWN EXCITEABILITY AND JUST TO REMIND THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T REMEMBER WHAT EXCITABILITY IS EXCITABILITY IS THE THRESHOLD IT WHICH A GIVEN NURON NERVESEL CAN BE ACTIVE OR NOT SO WHEN WE BREATHE A CERTAIN WAY THE NURONS OF OUR BRAIN ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET ENGAGED THEY'R MORE LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE AND WHEN WE BREATHE IN OTHER WAYS OUR BRAIN BECOMES HARDER TO ACTIVATE IT'S EXCITABILITY IS REDUCED NOW YOU MIGHT THINK EXCITABILITY IS A GREAT THING YOU ALWAYS WANT YOUR BRAIN TO BE EXCITABLE BUT THAT'S I HALLY NOT THE CASE AND IN FACT THAT VERY STATEMENT THE BALUSTRY KNOWN SUMGEN MADE LED TO A NUMBER OF OTHER INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE'RE REALLY IMPORTANT IN DEFINING HOW IF PEOPLE OVER BREATHE THAT IS IF THEY HYPER VENTILATE AT REST THEY EXPELL THAT IS THEY EXHAIL TOO MUCH CARBONDIOXIDE WHAT THAT CLASSIC PAPER BY BALUSTRY NOWNS SUMPTION LED TO WAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIONS IN HUMANS LOOKING AT HOW DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF BREATHING IMPACT THE OVERALL STATE OF THE BRAIN END THE ABILITY OF THE BRAIN TO RESPOND TO CERTAIN WHATARE CALLED CENSORY STIMULE KEEP IN MIND THEYURE BRAIN IS ALWAYS ACTIVE THE NURONS ARE FIRING AT LOW LEVEL LOW LEVEL LO LEVEL BUT WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING OR HER SOMETHING OR YOU WANT A FOCUS ON SOMETHING OR YOU WANT TO EXERCISE ORE REALLY LISTEN TO SOMETHING OR LEARN CERTAIN CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN NEED TO BE MORE ACTIVE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS THERE NEEDS TO BE REALLY HIGH WHAT'S CALLED SIGNAL TO NOISE THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF NOISE IN CHATTER IN THE BACKGROUND JUST LIKE THE THE CHATTER AT A COXTAIL PARTY ARE A STATIUM EVENT IN ORDER TO REALLY PAY ATTENTION FOCUS LEARN ALL THE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT THE BRAIN CAN DO YOU NEED THAT SIGNAL TO GET ABOVE THAN NOISE THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL PAPER THAT ASKS HOW DOES THE PATTERN OF BREATHING IN PARTICULAR HOW DOES OVER BREATHING CHANGE THE PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN THIS IS A PAPER ENTITLED EFFECTS OF VOLUNTARY HYPER VENTILATION ON CORTICAL CENSORY RESPONSES AND I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDY IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS IT'S A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED PAPER IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE DETAILED ANALYSIES HOWEVER THE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS PAPER IS EXQUISITELY SIMPLE AND I ALSO BELIEVE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BASICALLY WHAT IT SHOWED IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE HYPER VENTILATE THEY EXPEL THAT IS THEY EXHAIL MORE CARBONDIOXIDE THAN THEY WOULD NORMALLY SO THEY BECOME WHAT'S CALLED HYPO CAPNIC OK CARBONDOXIDE LEVELS ARE LOW IN THE BLOOD AND OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEY BECOME LOW IN THE TISSUES OF THE BODY WHEN THAT CARBONDOXIDE LEVEL DROPS LOW YOU WOULD SAY O K WELL THEU'RE STILL BRINGING IN A LOT OF OXYGEN BECAUSE THEY'R THESE PEOPLE ARE HYPER VENTILATING SO THEY SHOULD FEEL REALLY ALERT AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THE PEOPLE FEEL VERY ALERT HOWEVER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BRINGING ENOUGH CARBONOXIDE IN OR RATHER THE PROPER WAY TO SAY T WOULD BE BECAUSE THERE OVER BREATHING EXAILING TOO MUCH THEY ARE NOT RETAINING OR KEEPING IN ENOUGH CARBONDIOXIDE WELL THEN THAT LACK OF CARBONDIOXIDE MEANS THAT THE OXYGEN THAT THEY ARE BREATHING IN CAN'T BE LIBERATED FROM THE HEMOGLOBIN CAN'T GET TO THE BRAIN AND WHAT THEY OBSERVE IS ABOUT A THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN THAT'S BEING DELIVERED TO THE BRAIN AND THE REDUCTION AN CARBONDOXIDE ALSO PREVENT SOME OF THE NORMAL PATTERNS OF VAZO DILATION THAT THE DILATING THE OPENING UP AF THE CAPILARIES SO AGAIN LESS BLOOD FLOW BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY AS IT SHOWN IN THIS PAPER THE BRAIN OVERALL BECOMES HYPER EXCITABLE IT'S AS IF IT'S BEING STARVED OF OXYGEN AND BLOOD FLOW AND ALL THE NURONS IN A VERY NON SPACIFIC WAYS START INCREASING THEIR FIRING LEVELS TO THE BACKGROUND ACTIVITIES GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDERS LIKE THE RUMBLER THE N OISE OF A CROWD AT A STADIUM AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE SENSORY INPUT FROM A SOUND OR FROM A TOUCH OR FROM SOME OTHER EVENT IN THE WORLD DOESN'T GET ABOVE THE NOISE WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WHEN WE HYPER VENTILY BECAUSE WE AREN'T RETAINING ENOUGH CARBONDOXIDE WE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN TO THE TISSUES THAT NEED OXYGEN AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT THE BRAIN BECOMES HYPER EXCITABLE WE HACE SIOU KNOW THAT THERE'S AN INCREASE IN ANXIETY AND WE BECOME LESS GOOD LESS EFFICIENT AT DETECTING THINGS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT SO WE'RE NOT PROCESSING INFORMATION AS WELL AT ALL THE NOISE GOES UP AND THE SIGNAL GOES DOWN AGAIN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SET OF FINDINGS I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT HYPER VENTILATION IS ONE WAY THAT IN THE LABORATORY ANYWAY OR IN NEUROW SURGERY UNUTES FOR SOME TIME PHYSICIANS WOULD EVOKE SEIZURE IN SEIZURE PRONE PATIENTS THE REAS ON THAT WORKS IS EXACTLY THE EXPLANATION I JUST GAVE YOU SEIZURE IS A HYPER EXCITABILITY THE BRAIN NOT ENOUGH INHIBITION OR SUPPRESSION OF THE OVER ALL CIRCUITRY SO YOU GET THESE WAVES ARE THESE STORMS OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY LOW LEVELS OF CARBONDOXIDE IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE OF LOW LEVELS OF CARBONDOXIDE IN THE BLOOD ARE ONE OF THE MAJOR TRIGGERS FOR SEIZURES NOW I REALIZE THAT MOST PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS ARE NOT EPILEPTIC BUT NONE THE LESS THIS BRINGS US ALL BACK TO THIS QUESTION OF WHAT IS NORMAL HEALTHY BREATHING S I MENTION BEFORE NORMAL HEALTHY BREATHING IS BREATHING ABOUT SIX LEADERS OF AIR PER MINUTE BUT OF COURSE MOST OF UST DON'T THINK IN TERMS OF LEADERS OF AIR WHEN I CAN GO MEASURE OUR LONG CAPACITY AT LEAST MOST OF US AREN'T GING TO DO THAT THASICALLY IF YOU ARE TAKING RELATIVELY SHALLOW BREATHS AND YOU'RE JUST SITTING THERE WORKING OR MABE EVEN WALKING SLOWLY GET NOT TALKING ARE ENGAGING IN ANY KIND OF SPEECH OR EATING CHANCES ARE SIX LEADERS OF AIR PER MINUTE IS ABOUT TWELVE SHALLOW ISS BREATHS AND WHEN I SAY SHALLOW I DON'T MEAN YOU KNOW YOU KNOW BREATHING LIKE LOW BUNNING RABIT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I JUST MEAN WE DON'T CASUALLY BREATHING IN OUT IN OUT THE STUDIES THAT HOVE EXPLORED THE BREATHING PATTERNS IN A LARGE POPULATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT SUFFERING NECESSARILY FROM ANY ONE SPECIFIC AILMENT HAVE SHOWN THAT MOST PEOPLE BREATHE FAR TOO MUCH PER MINUTE THAT THEIR ENGAGING IN ANYWHERE FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY OR EVEN THIRTY SHALLOW BREATHS PERMINTE SO THEY ARE VASTLY OVER BREATHING RELATIVE TO HOW THEY SHOULD BE BREATHING NOW OF COURSE IF YOU BREATHE MORE DEEPLY SO YOU TAKE A VIGOROUS IN HOUT AND THEN YOU EXPEL THAT AIR WELL THEN FOR TO GET SIX LEADERS OF AIR INT YOUR SYSTEM PER MINUTE YOU ARE PROBABLY ONLY GOING TO NEED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOR AND SIX BREATHS IN ORDER TO GET THAT SIX LEADERS PERMINUTE NOW THE TOTAL TIME THAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT IN HAL AND EXALE ISN'T THAT MUCH LONGER THAN A K OF SHALLOW B REATH PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT DELIBERATELY BREATHING QUICKLY DURING THOSE SHALLOW BREATHS SO THEN YOU SAY WELL HOW IS IT THAT NORMAL HEALTHY BREATHING THAT DELIVERS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF CARBONDOXIDE INTO THE SYSTEM AND DOESN'T EXPELL DOESN'T EXALE TOO MUCH CARBONOXIDE NOW HOW WE SPUST TO DO THAT NORMAL BREATHING AND OW USELESS TO BREATHE FOUR TIMES THAN HOLD YOUR BREATH UNTIL THE MINUTE PASSES NO WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE CORRECT PATTERN OF BREATHING IS GOING TO INVOLVE TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL NASAL BREATHING BECAUSE OF THE RESISTANCE AT PROVIDESTHROUGH THE NOSE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS GOING TO DELIVER MORE OXYGEN ANTO YOUR S YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE MORE AIR PRESSURE TO FILL YOUR LUNGS THAT GREATER AIR PRESSURE IS GOING TO TAKE LONGER TO EXALE SO ALREADY WE'RE INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT EACH BREATH IS GOING TO TAKE AND ALSO WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE BREATHING IN THE PROPER HEALTHY MANNER THAT IS THAT ARE BALANCING OXYGEN AND CARBONOXIDE IN THE PROPER WAYS ARE ALSO TAKING PAUSES BETWEEN BREATHS THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A BRAIN CENTER THE PREBOUTSING YOUR COMPLEX THAT CAN CONTROL OR USHES A DOES CONTROL IN HALE EXALE RHYTHMIC BREATHING THOSE PAUSES BETWEEN BREATHS ARE NOT ALWAYS PRESENT IN FACT OFTEN ARE NOT PRESENT FROM PEOPLE'S BASELINE BREATHING PATTERNS AS AS A CONSEQUENCE THEY OVERBREATHE AND AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE WHEN PEOPLE OVERBREATHE THE BRAIN BECOMES HYPER EXCITABLE AT THE LEVEL OF THE BACKGROUND NOISE AND YET THEY ARE LESS EFFICIENT AT DETECTING AND LEARNING INFORMATION WE'LL GET INTO THE SPECIFIC STUDIES THAT RELY ILLUSTRATE THE LEARNING ASPECT OF IT LATER BUT THEY ARE LESS EFFICIENT AT DETECTING AND LEARNING INFORMATION AT FOCUSING AND SO ON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS OVERBREATHING AND THE HYPERICCIDE ABILITY THAT CAUSES NOW OF COURSE THAT'S ALSO JUST EMPHASIZING THE EFFECTS OF OVERBREATHING AND LACK OF CARBONDOXIDE ON THE BRAIN THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF STUDIES SHOWING THAT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CARBONDOXIDE IN THE TISSUES OF OUR BODY THAT'S ALSO PROBLEMATIC FOR ALL THE TISSUES THE LIVER THE LUNGS THEMSELVES THE STOMAC ET CETERA THAT RELATE LARGELY TO SHIFTS IN P H BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT CARBONDOXIDE STRONGLY REGULATES THE ACIDITY ALCALINITY OF THE BLOOD AND THE TISSUES THAT THAT BLOOD SUPPLIES NUTRIENCE TO INCLUDING CARBONOXIDE SO THE BASIC TAKE AWAY HERE IS YOU WANT TO BREATHE IN HEALTHY MANNER AT REAST AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO SPEND SOME TIME AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH MAY BE A MINUTE OR SO EACH DAY PAYING ATTENTIENT TO HOW QUICKLY YOU ARE BREATHING PERMINUTE WHEN YOU ARE SIMPLY AT REST WHEN YOU'RE MAKING COFFEE IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU'RE SITTING DOWN TO READ WHEN YOU'RE ON SOCIAL MEDIA CHRONICALLY HOLDING YOUR BREATH ISN'T GOOD BUT NEITHER IS OVERBREATHING AND AGAIN EVERY STUDY THAT IS EXAMINED THET TYPICAL PATTERNS OF BREATHING AND PATTERNS OF BREATHING THAT SHOW UP AS NORMAL AND ABNORMAL HAS FOUND THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT DURING THE NIGHT TIME PEOPLE ARE UNDERBREATHING AND IN THE DAYTIME THEY ARE OVERBREATHING THEIR HYPER VENTILATING SO NEXT I LIKE TO ADDRESS WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT YOUR NORMAL PATTER NS OF BREATHING THAT IS HOW YOU OR ANY ONE CAN ADJUST THEIR NORMAL PATTERNS OF BREATHING FROM AN UNHEALTHY TO AN UNHEALTHY STATE BUT THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO OF COURSE IS DETERMINED WHETHER NOT YOUR ALREADY BREATHING IN AN UNHEALTHY OR IN A HEALTHY WAY AND AGAIN WHENG I SAY HEAL TH YOU'RE UNHEALTHY I MEAN ARE YOU OVER BREATHING ARE OU UNDERBREATHING ARE YOU DELIBERING THE APPROPRIATE RATIOS OF OXYGEN AND CARBONDOXIDE TO THE TISSUES OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE'REGOING TO DO A SIMPLE TEST AGAIN PLEASE DON'T DO THI WELL DRIVING OR OPERATING HEAVY MACHINERY OR ON NEAR WATER OF ANY KIND BUT ASSUMING THAT YO'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THOSE THINGS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SIT DOWN CERTAINLY NOT LIE DOWN BUT JUST SIT DOWN SUPPOSE YOU ALSO CO DO IT STANDING AND WE ARE GOING TO DO WHAT'S CALLED THE CARBONDIOXIDE TOLERANCE TEST THE CARBONDIOXIDE TOLERANCE TEST IS I SORT OF BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MEASURE OF HOW WELL YOU ARE MANAGING CARBON DIOXIDE THAT IS HOW WELL YOU CON CONTROL YOUR BREATHING AT BOTH THE MECHANICAL AND THE CHEMICAL LEVEL IT'S A VERY SIMPLE TEST WE OU'RE GOING TO DO IS FOR THE NEXT TEN SECONDS OR SO WHILE I'M SPEAKING YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BREATHE NORMALLY NOW AGAIN AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE I'M GOING TO INCOURAGE YOU TO BE A NASAL BREATHER WHENEVER POSSIBLE BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH YOU WANT TO ENGAGE MOUTH BREATHING BUT FOR THE TIME BEING AS I CONTINUE TO BLAB ON FOR THE NEXT FEW SECONDS JUST INHALE THROUGH YOUR NOSE EXHAILE THROUGH YOUR NOSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DELIBERATELY SLOW YOUR BREATHING OR INCREASE THE CADENCE OF YOUR BREATHING HOWEVER IN THAT TIME YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO WANT TO FIND SOME SORT OF TIME MEASURING DEVICE LIKE COULD BE YOUR PHONE ORE COULD BE A STOP WATCH WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO IN A FEW MINUTES IS I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO INHALE THROUGH YOUR NOSE AS DEEPLY AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN THAT IS YOU'RE GING TO FILL YOUR LUNGS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND THEN START A TIMER AND MEASURE HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR YOU TO DELIBERATELY CONTROL THAT EXHAIL UNTIL YOUR LUNGS ARE EMPTY CASE SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A CONTROLLED EXHAL THROUGH THE NOSE AFTER A BIG DEEP BREATH BUT FOR THE TIME BEING KEEP BREATHING AT A AND OF CALM REGULAR CADENCE SO YOUE CAN FIND THAT TIME MEASURING DEVICE NOW OR YOU CAN COME BACK TO IT LATER IF YOU LIKE WHEN I SAY INHALE YOU'RE GOING TO INHALE AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN THROUGH YOUR NOSE REMEMBERING THAT THE DIAPHRAM CAN REALLY HELP YOU HERE TO GET A DEEP INHAL BY HAVING YOUR BELLY MOVE OUT WHILE YOU INHAL AND THEN WHEN I SAY START YOUREGIN A MEASURE THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO DO A COMPLETE LUNGS EMPTY EXHAIL IN FACT I'LL MEASURE IT FOR YOU A THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE RARE INSTANCES IN THIS PODCAST WHERE AN THERE'S GOING TO BE ALONG PERIOD OF SILENCE AS I MEASURE SOMETHNG SO I'VE GOT A STOP WATCH HERE SO PLEASE PREPARE TO DO THE BIG INHALE AND START INHALING NOW SO INHALE AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN THROUGH YOUR NOSE FILL YOUR LUNGS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN OQUE NOW START MEANING SLOWLY CONTROL THE EXHAL THROUG YOUR KNOWS YOU'RE TRYING TO LET THAT AIR OUT AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE AND I'M JUST GON O CALL OUT EVERY TEN OR FIFTEEN SECONDS OR SO AND YOU WANT TO NOTE WHEN YOUR LUNGS ARE EMPTY I KNOW YOU CAN HOLD YOUR BREATH WITH YOUR LUNGS EMPTY THAT IS NOT AN ACCURATE MEASURE FIFTEEN SECONDS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOTE WHEN YOUR LUNGS ARE EMPTY AND THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTROL THE EXHAIL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT YOU DON'T ARRIVE AT THAT LUNGS EMPTY TIME TOO QUICKLY I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT TOO QUICKLY MEANS THIRTY SECONDS  FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE ALREADY REACHED SLUNGS EMPTY PLEASE GO BACK TO BREATHING NORMALLY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVEN'T AND HANGING HERE A LITTLE LONGER IF YOU'RE STILL DISCARDING THAT IR FORTY FIVE SECONDS AND WE'RE ROUNDING TOWARD A MINUTE NOT QUITE THER SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY STILL LETTING OUT THAT AIR I WANT TO POINT OUT NONE OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH CARTYOVASCULAR FITNESS LEVEL AT LEAST NOT IN ANY KIND OF DIRECT WAY AND SIXTY SECONDS AND I REALIZE THERE WILL BE A SMALL SUBSET OF YOU OUT THER THAT ARE STILL EXPEILING YOUR AIR IN A SLOW LUNGS A SLOW EXAIL MANNER THROUGH THE KNOWS O CASE OR WHAT WE JUST DID IS A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CARBONDIOXIDE DISCARD RATE O K IF YOU NEED TO PAUSE THIS AND GO BACK AND TRY IT AGAIN YJUST WANT A TIME HOW LONG IT TAKES YOU TO GO FROM LUNGSFULL TO LUNGS EMPTY AGAIN WITH THE FULL UNDERSTANDING I KNOW THAT YOU CAN ALL SIT THERE LIKE BEASTS AND HOLD YOUR BREATH YOU'RE LUNGS EMPTY BUT PLEASE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GIN BEIN FORMATIVE FOR WHAT I'M TELLING YOU NOW WHEN I'M N TELL YOU NOW IS THAT IF IT TOOK YOU TWENTY SECONDS OR LESS TO EXPEL ALL YOUR AIR THAT IS YOU COULDN'T EXTEND THAT EXAIL LONGER THAN TWENTY SECONDS IN A KIND OF BACK OF THE ENVELOPE WAY OU WE CAN SAY THAT YOU HAVE IRRELATIVELY BRIEF OR LOW CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE  IF IT TOOK YOU SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FORTY MAY BE FORTY FIVE SECONDS TO EXPEL ALL YOUR AIR THAT IS YOU COULD CONTROL THAT EXHAIL FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE SECONS OR THIRTY SECONDS THEN YOU HAVE A MODERATE LEVEL OF CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE AND IF FOR INSTANCE YOU WARE ABLE TO GO UP FIFTY SECONDS OR LONGER FOR THAT DISCARD UNTIL YOU HIT LUNGS EMPTY YOU'VE A FAIRLY HIGH DEGREE OF CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE NOW HERE'S THE DEAL IF YOU HAD LOW CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE THAT IS YOU'RE TWENTY SECONDS OR LESS YOU'RE GOING TO RIGHT DOWN THE NUMBER THREE O K IF YOU HAD MODERATE LEVELS OF CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE DOWN THE NUMBER FIVE OR YOU COULD EVEN PUT FIVE TO SIX AND THEN IF YOU ARE IN THAT BRACKET OF PEOPLE THAT WAS ABLE TO DISCARD YOUR AIR OVER A PERIOD OF FIFTY SECONDS OR MORE YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE DOWN THE NUMBER EIGHT TO TEN O K NOW WHAT ARE THESE NUMBERS WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AND BEFORE WE GET INTO WHAT TO DO WITH THESE NUMBERS I WANT EMPHASIZE AGAIN THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO DO WITH FITNESS LEVEL PER SAY I KNOW SOME WORLD CLASS TRY ATHLETES THAT HAVE VERY FAST CARBONDOXIDE BLOW OFF TIMES THAT IS THEIR DISCARD RATES ARE TWENTY SECONDS OR LEST I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IF YOU'R VERY STRAST THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO BE VERY SMALL IF YOU'RE VERY RELAX LIKE YOU ISWOKE UP AFTER AN LONG NIGHT OF SLEEP AND YOU FEEL GREAT THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO BE EXTENDED OCASE SO THIS IS A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MEASURE THAT YOU'RE GING TO USE EACH TIME YOU DECIDE TO DO THE EXERCISE I MEN I TELL YOU ABOUT IN A MOMENT AND THE EXERCISE IM MA TELL YOU ABOUT IN A MOMENT CAN BE DONE EVERY DAY IF YOU LIKE BUT WHAT THE MOST INTERESTING STUDIES AT LEAST TO ME INDICATE IS THAT YOU COULD DO THE EXERCISE I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT EVEN JUST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK AND GREATLY INPROVE YOUR EFFICIENCY OF BREATHING AND SHIFT YOURSELF AWAY FROM OVERBREATHING WHEN AT REST EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT HIGHER BREATHING AT REST O CAO WHAT IS THIS EXERCISE WHELL YOU JUST GOT YOUR NUMBER ITHER LOW MEDIUM OR HIHBRACET NUMBER FOR CARBONDITE DIOXIDE DISCARRED RATE MEMBER IF YOU'RE IN THE LOW CATEGORY YOUR NUMBERS THREE IF YOUR MEDIUM IT'S FIVE TO SIX AND IF YOU ARE IN THE LONG CARBONDOXIDE DISCARED RATE LONG DURATION CARBONDOX AD DISCARD RATE THAT IS EIGHT TO TEN IS YOUR NUMBER NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO TWO MINUTES OF WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD CALL BOX BREATHING WHAT IS BOX BREATHING BOX BREATHING ARE EQUAL DURATION INHAL HOLD EXHAL HOLD REPEAT SO IN HAIL HOLD EXHAIL HOLD SOUNDS VERY EASY RITE HOW LONG DO YOU INHAL AND THEN HOLD EXHAIL AND THEN HOLD WELL YOU NOW KNOW IF YOU WERE IN THE LOW GROUP OF CARBONDOX IDE DISCARD RATE YOU'RE INHALES CAN BE THREE SECONDS YOUR HOLD WILL BE THREE SECONDS YOUR EXHAIL WILL BE THREE SECONDS AND THEN YOU REPEAT THREE SECONDS SO EACH SIDES THE BOX IF YOU WILL IS CAN BE THREE SECONDS LONG IF YOU WARE IN THE MODERATE CARBONDOX IDE DISCARRED RATE CATEGORY THEN YOU'RE GOING TO INHAL FOR FIVE TO SIX SECONDS HOLD FOR FIVE TO SIX EXHAIL FOR FIVE TO SIX HOLD FOR FIVE TO SIX REPEAT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES YOU COULD DO THREE MINUTES IF YOU WANT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE PROTOCALS THAT ARE FEASIBLE FOR MOST PEOPLE AND THAT'S GOING TO MEAN DOING THINGS FOR ABOUT TWO TO FIVE MINUTES WHEN IT COMES TO THESE BREATH REHABILITATION EXERCISES FOR RESTORING NORMAL BREATHING AND THEN COURSE IF YOU WERE IN THE LONG CATEGORY OF CARBONDOXIDE DISCARED RATE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IN EIGHT TO TEN SECOND INHAL EIGHT TO TEN SECOND HOLD EIGHT TO TEN SECOND EXHAIL EIGHTS ITS TEND SECOND HOLD AND REPEAT OK SO YOU COULD DO THAT EXERCISE NOW IF YOU LIKE OR YOU COULD DO IT AT SOME POINT OFFLINE YOU CAN PAUSE THIS PODCAST IF YOU WANT AND GO TRY IT THAT'S AN EXERCISE THAT YOU CAN DO FOR ABOUT TWO TO THREE MINUTES ONCE OR TWICE PER WEEK WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU DO THAT EXERCISE WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU ARE GREATLY INCREASING YOUR NURL MECHANICAL CONTROL OVER THE DIAPHRAM THIS VERY IMPORTANT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS FRANDIC NERVE PATHWAY IN THE DIAPHRAM AND YOURE GREATLY IN INCREASING YOURE MECHANICAL CONTROL OVER THIS PATHWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS WE CALL NERRO PLASTICITY WHEN YOU DELIBERATELY FOCUS ON A ASPECT OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROL AN PARTICULAR NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROL OVER MUSCULATURE THAT NORMALLY IS SUBCONSCIOUS ANDYOUR NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHEN YOU ACTIVELY TAKE CONTROL OF THAT IT REQUIRES THAT YOUR BRAIN ADJUST AND REWIRE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THAT CIRCUIT AND THE WONDERFUL THING IS THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO CHANGES IN YOUR RESTING PATTERN OF BREATHING NOW WHY DID WE GO THROUGH THE WHOME BUSINESS OF DOING THE CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE TUST WELL FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T TOLERATE CARBONDOX ITE VERY WELL THEY DON'T HAVE VERY GOOD FHRENIC THAT IS NOR MECHANICAL CONTROL OF THE DIAPHRAM FOR WHATEVER REASON AGAIN DOESN'T MEAN YOURE NOT FIT IT JUST MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE OR YOU HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED NOR MECHANICAL CONTROL O THE DIAPHRAM IT'S WOULD BE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO BOX BREATHING FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES WITH EIGHT SECONDS IN EIGHT SECONDS HOLD EIGHT SECONDS EXALE EIGHT SECOND HOLD SO THAT'S WHY WE DO A A TEST TO SEE WHAT YOURE CAPABLE OF DOING YOU DON'T WANT THE BO BREATHING TO BE TOO STRAINED WERE YOU WHERE YOU'R REALLY CHALLENGE SHOULD GET AROUND THE WHOLE BOX YOU WANT IT TO BE RELATIVELY EASY BECAUSE REMEMBER YOUR TRYING TO TRANSLATE THISPATTERN TO YOUR NORMAL PATTERN OF BREATHING THAT IS YOUR PATTERN ER BREATHING WHEN YOUARE NOT CONSCIALS YOU THINKING ABOUT BRATHING AND WHAT ARE WE REALLY TRANSLATING WHEN WE DO THIS BOX BREATHING TYPE EXERCISE WHAT YOU'RE TRANSLATHING IS THE ABILITY TO PAUSE BETWEEN BREAST AND YET TAKE FULL MECHANICALLY DRIVEN BREAST THAT INVOLVE THE FRENTIC NERVE AND DIAPHRAM SO AGAIN YOU'RE ENCOURAGING ESPECIALLY V USE NASAL BREATHING WHEN YOU DO THE BOX BREATHING YOU'RE ENCOURAGING FRENIC CONTROL OVER THE DIAPHRAM AND YOURE GETTING THAT SIX LEADERS OF AIR PERMINUTE OR SO USING FEWER AND FUER BRATH SOVER TIME SO THIS IS A AGAIN ZERO COST ALTHOUGH IT DOES COST A LITTLE BIT OF TIME ZERO COST APPROACH TO ADJUSTING YOUR NORMAL PATTERN OF BREATHING AT REST WHICH HAS A HUGE NUMBER OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF YOUR ABILITY TO STAY RELATIVELY CALM TO NOT GET THE HYPRICIDEABILITY OF THE BRAIN IT IS ACTUALLY BEEN SHOWN AND A VARIOUS STUDIES WILL TALK ABOUT ONE IN PARTICULAR LATER TO GREATLY IMPROVE NOTCHUST LEVELS OF CALM AND REDUCE BOUTS OF STREST BUT ALSO IMPROVE NIGHT TIME SLEEP THERE ARE HUGE NUMBER OF BENEFITS THAT CAN COME FROM DOING THIS BOX BREATHNG EXERCISE BUT YOU GOT A GET THE DURATION OF THE SIDES OF THE BOX RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO THE CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE TEST ONE THING THAT MANY PEOPLE NOTICE AFTER DOING THE CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE TEST EVEN JUST ONCE AND THEN DOING THIS BOX BREATHING EXERCISE ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK IS THAT AFTER TWO OR THREE WEEKS THE BOX BREATHING ITSELF BECOMES VERY EASY AND IN THAT CASE I RECOMMEND TAKING THE CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE TEST OVER AGAIN AND ALMOST ALWAYS WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXTEND YOUR CARBONDOXIDE DISCARRED RATE AND THEREFORE YOU NOW FALL INTO A DIFFERENT CATEGORY NOT JUST THE LOWER MEDIUM BUT THE LONG CARBONDOXIDE DISCARRED RATE CATEGORY AND YOU ARE ABLE TO EXTEND THE DURATION OF THOSE INHALE HOLD EXHAL HOLDS DURING THE BOX BREATHING AND OF COURSE THE ULTIMATE BENEFIT OF ALL THIS IS THAT IT TRANSLATES TO DEEPER AND YET LESS FREQUENT BREATHING WHEN AT REST AND WHEN NOT CONSCIOUSLY PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW YOUR BREATHING DURING THE DAYTIME AGAIND IF A ALL POSSIBLE DO ALL OF THIS BREATHING THROUGH THE NOSE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE A SEVERELY ENCLUDED NOSE THE RECOMMENDATION ALWAYS IS TO BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE MORE BUT I DO REALIZE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE ITS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO BREATHE TROUGH THE NOSE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH AN INCLUDED NASAL PATHWAY AND A FOR YOU FOLKS DOING SOME OF THIS BREATHING THROUGH THE MOUTH CAN PROBABLY A SUFFICE BUT IF AT ALL POSSIBLE DO THE BREATHING THROUGH THE NOSE AND A PLEASE ALSO LET ME KNOW HOW YOUR PROGRESS AEVOLVES OVER TIME WITH THE CARBONOXIDE DISCARRED RATE AND THE BOX BREATHING AND OF COURSE THE POSITIVE SHIFTS THAT OCCUR IN NORMAL UNCONSCIOUS DAYTIME BREATHING TRANSLATE TO ALL THE OPPOSITE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE OVERBREATHING DURING THE DAYTIME SO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF THE CARBONDOXID TOLERANCE TEST AND THE EXERCISE USING BOX BREATHING TO RESTORE NORMAL PATTERNS OF BREATHING AND NOT OVERBREATHE AND THEREFORE NOT ELIMINATE TO MUCH CARBONDOXIDE IS EXACTLY THE TWO TESTS THAT WERE INCORPORATED INTO A STUDY THAT MY LABORATORY DID IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR ASSOCIATE SHAIRE OF PSYCHAETRY ATE STAMPHORID SCHOOL MEDICINE DOCTOR DAVID SPEAGLE WAS ALSO BEEN A GUESTD ON THIS PODCAST PREVIOUSLY AND THAT STUDY EXPLORED BOX BREATHING BUT IT ALSO EXPLORED OTHER FORMS OF BREATHING AND ACTUALLY COMPARED THOSE FORMS OF DELIBERATE BREATHING TO MEDITATION AS A MEANS TO EXPLORE WHAT ARE GOING TO BE THE MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSES AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO CHRONICALLY REDUCE STRESS AROUND THE CLOCK AND IMPROVE MOOD AND IMPROVE SLEEP SO THE STUDY ON REFERRING TO WAS JUST PUBLISHE RECENTLY IT'S ENTITLED BRIEF STRUCTURED RESPIRATION PRACTICES IN HANSEMOOD AND REDUCE PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS PAPER IN THE SHOWNOTE PAPTIONS WHAT THE STUDY REALLY FOCUSED ON WAS A SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT IS THE SHORTEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE PRACTICE THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IN ORDER TO REDUCED THEIR LEVELS OF STRESS NOCIOUS JURING THAT BREATHWORK PRACTICE OR MEDITATION PRACTICE BUT AROUND THE CLOCK TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP AND WE WERE EXCITED TO DO THE STUDY BECAUSE MANY STUDIES THAT EXPLORED HOW MEDITATION OR IN SOME CASES FEWER STUDIES AT EXPLORED HOW BREATHWORK CAN IMPACT DIFERENT BRAIN STATES OR BODILY STATES BUT VERY FEW STUDIES THAT EXPLORED HOW THOSE BREATHWORKOR MEDITATION PRACTICES INFLUENCED BODY BRAIN STATES AROUND THE CLOCK WHEN PEOPLE WERE NOT PERFORMING THE PARTICULAR MEDITATION OR BREATHWORK PRACTICE THE REASON WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS STUDY WAS REALLY FORTUNATE A THE FOLKS OVER IT WHOOP WERE GENEROUS ENOUGH TO DONATE ABUNCH OF WHOOP STRAPS WHICH ALLOWED US TO MEASURE HEARTRAT VARIABILITY A NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFERENT PHYSIOLOGICAL PERAMETERS WE ALSO GOT SUBJECTIVE REPORTS ABOUT PEOPLE'S MOOD AN FEELINGS OF WELL BEING WE GOT DATA ABOUT THEIR SLEEP PINED TO US FROM REMOTE LOCATIONS THESE PEOPLE RATHER THAN BEING BROUGHT TO THE LABORATORY AN BEING IN A VERY ARTIFICIAL CIRCUMSTANCE THE LABORATORY AS MUCH AS WE LIKE TO THINK OUR LABORATORY IS REALISTIC I WE HAVE VIRTUAL REALITY AND TINGS LIKE THAT THERE'S NOTHING AS REALISTIC AS THE REAL WORLD AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MORE THAN A HUNDRED SUBJECTS OUT IN THE REAL WORLD LIVING THEIR REAL LIVES PINGING BACK TO US DATA ALL THE TIME TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SO THAT WE COULD MEASURE HOW THEIR DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS THAT WE ASKED THEM TO DO BREATHWORK PRACTICES OR MEDITATION PRACTICES WERE IMPACTING PHYSIOLOGICAL PERAMETERS AND THEY WERE ALSO IN FORMING US REGULARLY ABOUT THEIR SUBJECTIVE MOOD ET CETERA WE GOT A LOT OF DATA AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND THE BASIC TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY WAS TWOFOLD FIRST OF ALV WE DISCOVERED THAT DELIBERATE BREATHWORK PRACTICES DONE FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES PER DAY ACROSS THE COURSE OF ABOUT A MONTH LED TO GREATER REDUCTIONS IN STRESS THEN DID A FIVE MINUTE A DAY MEDITATION PRACTICE NOW THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT MEDITATION IS NOT USEFUL IN FACT THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF PAPERS INCLUDING ONE PARTICULAR I SHOULD THA PARTICULARLY DAUTIFUL STUDY FROM WHENY SYZUKI'S LAB AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SHOWING THAT A DAILY TEN TO THIRTEEN MINUTE MINDFULNESS MEDITATION PRACTICE CAN GREATLY IMPROVE FOCUS MEMORY AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS RELATED TO COGNITION AND LEARNING HOWEVER THE RESEARCH ON MEDITATION HAS SHOWN US THAT MEDITATION AT LEAST SHORT MEDITATIONS MAINLY LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN FOCUS IN MEMORY NOT SO MUCH REDUCTIONS IN STRASSAL THOUGH THEY DO LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN STRASS WILL WE FOUND WAS THAT ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BREATHWORK PRACTICES AND WE EXPLORED THREE DONE FOR FIVE MINUTES A DAY HOUT PERFORMED MEDITATION IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY OF BREATHWORK TO REDUCE STRESS AROUND THE CLOCK COMPARED TO MEDITATION THE THREE TYPES OF BREATHWORK THAT WE EXPLORED ALSO SHOWE DIFFERENT EFFACTS I SHOULD MENTION THE THREE TYPES OF BREATHWORK THAT WE COMPARED WERE BOX BREATHING OF THE SORT THAT YOU JUST LEARNED ABOUT WE COMPARED THAT TO SOMETHING CALLED SCYCLIC SIGING WHICH INVOLVES TWO INHALS THROUGH THE NOSE TO GET MAXIMILIINFLATED LUNGS FOLLOWED BY A LONG EXHALE I'LL RETURN TO THAT IN A MOMENT THAT WAS REPEATED FOR FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME FOR EACH CESSION AND A THIRD BREATHWORK PRACTICE WHICH WAS CYCLIC HY PREVENTILATION WHICH AS THE NAME SUGGESTS INVOLVES PEOPLE INHALING DEEPLY THROUGH THE NOSE THAN EXHALING PASSIVELY THROUGH THE MOUTH AND THEN REPEATING INHAL THROUGH THE NOSE EXHELE THROUGH THE MOUTH REPEATING THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE CYCLES ONE CYCLE BEING AN INHAL END AN EXALE SO THAT EQUALS ONE CYCLE REPEAN THAT FOR TWENTYFI CYCLES THAN EXHALING ALL THEIR AIR AND HOLDING THEIR BREATH WITH LUNGS EMPTY FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN TO THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN REPEATING INHALE EXELE CYCLIHYPEROVENTILATION FOR THE DURATION OF FIVE MINUTES CAS SO PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED INTO THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS EITHEIR MINDFULNESS MEDITATION WHERE THEY SAT THEY WERE NOT TOLD TO CONTROL THEIR BREATHING IN ANY SPYS VIC WAY THAT CLOSED THEIR EYES THEIR FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON A REGION JUST BEHIND THEIR FOREHEAD ONE GROUP TO THAT THE OTHER GROUP DID CYCLIC SAWING ANOTHER GROUP DID BOX BREATHING ANOTHER GROUP DID SYCLIC HYPERVENTILATION AS ANY SORT OF CLINICAL TRIAL LIKE THIS OUGHT TO WE THEN SWAP PEOPLE INTO DIFFERENT GROUP SO THEY SERVED AS THEIR OWN CONTROL SO WE COULD EVALUATE ANY AND A BETWEEN AND WITHIN INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY GAN THEIRE LOT OF DATE ON THIS PAPER BUT THE TAKE AWAY WAS THAT FOR THE SAKE OF STRESS REDUCTION AROUND THE CLACK AND FOR THE SAKE OF IMPROVING SLEEP AND MOOD THE MOST EFFECTIVE PRACTICE OF THE FORE PRACTICES THAT WE EXAMINED IT WAS THE SYCLIC SIGHING AGAIN SYCLIC SIGHING AS PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING WAY YOU INHALE THROUGH THE NOSE AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN THEN YOU DO A SECOND INHALE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS TO TRYING MAXIMALLYINFLATE THE LUNGS IN FACT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WE KNOW THAT DURING THAT SECOND INHALE EVEN IF IT'S JUST A VERY SHARP SHORT INHALE THE EXTRA PHYSICAL VIGOR THAT'S REQUIRED TO GENERATE THAT SECOND INHALE CAUSES THOSE AVIOLE OF THE LUNGS WHICH MAY HAVE COLLAPSED AND INDEED IN BETWEEN BREATHS AND OFTEN EVEN JUST THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY IN A SPECIAL IF WE GET SCRESSED THOSE AVIOLYVEF THE LUNG STARTS IT COLLAPSE AND BECAUSE THEI'R DAMP ON THE INSIDE THEIR THEY HAVE ELIBIT OF FLUID THAYT LIKE A BALLOON WITH A L A BIT OF FLUIT IN IN THE MIDDLE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF PHYSICAL FORCE TO PUT TO POP THOSE OPEN IR YOUE NOT LITERALLY EXPLODING THEM POP BUT YOUR REINFLATING THEM WITH AIR AND THEN YOU PERFORM THE LONG EXHAL THROUGH THE MOUTH UNTIL LUNGS ARE EMPTY SO IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THIS NOW WE KNOW THAT ONE SINGLE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH OF THE SORT THAT I JUST DESCRIBED PERFORM TO ANY TIME OF DAY UNDER ANY CONDITIONS WHETHERE NOT YOU'REABOUT TO WALK ON STAGE TO GIVE A TALK OR YOU'RE IN A MEETING IN YOUR FEELING STRESSD OR YOUARE IN A CONVERSATION THAT'S VERY STRESSFUL OR YOU CAN FEEL STRESS MOUNTING BECAUSE YOU'RE INTRAFFIC OR ANY NUMBER OF PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSICAL STRESSERS THAT MAY BE APPROACHING YOU OR YOU FEEL OUR OPPRESSING YOU DOING ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH OF THE SORT THAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS THE FASTEST PHYSIOLOGICALLY VERIFIED WAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF TO REDUCE YOUR LEVELS OF STRESS AND TO REINTRODUCE CALM THAT IS TO SHIFT YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM FROM A STATE OF HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL THAT IS SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AS IT'S CALLED IS AT A HIGHER ACTIVATION LEVEL THAN THE SO CALL PARI SMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AGAIN SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HAVING NOTHING DO AS SYMPATHY AS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SO CALLED FIGHT OR FLIGHT AL THOUGH IT CONTROLS OTHER THINGS DO INCLUDING POSITIVE AROUSAL AND THE PARA SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OFTEN REFERED TO AS THE REST IN DIGEST SYSTEM ALTHOUGH IT DOES OTHER THINGS TO IS ASSOCIATE WITH CALMING THOSE TWO THINGS ARE ALWAYS IN KIND OF PUSHPULL WITH ONE ANOTHER LIKE A SEA SAW OR PUSHPULL HOVERY ONE TO THINK ABOUT IT ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGE MEANING THAT BIG DEEP INHALE SHORT SECOND INHALE ALSO THOUGH THE NOSE AND THEN LONG EXALE TO COMPLETELY LUNGS EMPTY IS KNOWN TO RESTORE THE LEVEL OF BALANCE IN THE SYMPATHETIC PARI SYMPATHETIC NURL CIRCUITRIES AND IS THE FASTEST WAY TO REINTRODUCE CALM THAT'S ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGE IN THIS STUDY WHAT WE ASKED WAS THAT PEOPLE PERFORM THAT REPEATEDLY SO CALLED SYCLIC SIGHING FOR THE DURATION OF FIVE MINUTES AND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THAT SYCLIC SIGHING FOR FIVE MINUTES A DAY REGARDLESS OF THE TIME OF DAY THAT THEY DID IT EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST REDUCTIONS IN STRESS NOT JUST DURING THE PRACTICE BUT AROUND THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE AN IT TRANSLATED AGAIN TO ALL SORTS OF POSITIVE SUBJECTIVE CHANGES IMPROEMENTS IN SLEEP LOWER RESTING HEART RATE AT ALL TIMES OF DAY SO THIS IS IMPORTANT AGAIN THIS STUDY WAS NOT JUST EXPLORING WHAT HAPPENS DURING MEDITATION OR BREATH WORK CYCLIC SIGHING ET CETERA IT WAS EXPLORING HOW THE CHANGES THAT OCCUR DURING THAT PRACTICE TRANSLATE TO CHANGES IN BREATHING AND HEART RATE MOOD ET CETERA THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE SO THE TAKE AWAY HERE IS TWOFOLD FIRST OF ALL IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO IMPROVE YOUR MOOD AND REDUCE YOUR OVER ALL LEVELS OF STRESS AND YOU ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES A DAY TO INVEST IN THAT HOPE FULR YOURE DOING ALL THE OTHER THINGS LIKE TRY TO GET PROPER SLEEP AND EXERCISE SOCIAL CONNECTION NUTRITION ET CETERA SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNING OF COURSE CAN'T LEAVE THAT OUT BUT IF YOU WERE GOING TO DEVOTE FIVE MINUTES A DAY TO A STRESS REDUCTION PRACTICE THAT IS NOW SUPPORTED BY DATA TO TRANSLATE TO REDUCTIONS AND STRESS AROUND THE CLOCK THE DAY TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO INVEST THAT IN SYCLIC GHING THAT IS DOUBLEIN HAIL THROUGH THE NOSE EXTENDED EXHAIL THROUGH THE MOUTH UNTIL YOUR LUNGS ER EMPTY THAN REPEAT FOR FIVE MINUTES A DAY YOU OF COURSE IF YOU LIKE COULD DO MEDITATION IT STILL HAD POSITIVE EFFECTS MEANING IT REDUCE STRESS ALTHOUGH NOT AS MUCH AS CYCL IC SIGING YOU COULD DO BOX BREATHING IF YOU WANT FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING STRESS ALL THE PRACTICES WE EXPLORED DID REDUCE STRESS BUT CYCLIC SIGHING PERFORM FOR FIVE MINUTES A DAY HAD THE MOST ROBUST IN PERVASIVE EFFECT IN REDUCING STRESS IMPROVING MOOD AND IMPROVING SLEEP THAT'S THE FIRST MESSAGE OF THE STUDY THE SECOND TAKE AWAY IS THAT ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH THAT'S RIGHT JUST ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH WHERE YOU INHAIL DEEPLY THROUGH THE NOSE ANOTHER INHAIL THROUGH THE NOSE TO MAXIMALY IMPLATE THE OVIOLE THE LUNGS AND THEN YOU EXHAIL TO COMPLETELY LUNG'S EMPTY AND THEN GO BACK TO NORMAL BREATHING IS THE FASTEST WAY TO INTRODUCE A LEVEL OF CALM AND TO REDUCE YOUR OVER ALL LEVELS OF STRESS IN REAL TIME AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT OUT THERE THESE DAYS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT STRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES AND MOST ALL OF THE STRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES THAT'V BEEN EXPLORED EVERYTHING FROM MASSAGE TO MEDITATION TO BREATH WORK A TO A HOT SHOWER OUT TO A FOOT RUB WILL CALM YOU DOWN THE QUESTION IS DUE THEY CALM YOU DOWN JUST DURING THAT PRACTICE GREAT IF IT DOES BUT DOES IT ALSO TRANSLATE TO REDUCE LEVELS OF STRESS AT OTHER TIMES IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE AND OTHER POSIVE EFFECTS AS WELL SO ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO A JUST THAT RATIO OF SYMPATHETIC TO PARISIMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND IMMEDIATELY BRING ABOUT CALM SO A S EXCELLENT FOR REAL TIME CONTROL OF STRESS THE OTHER THING ABOUT PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE IS THAT IT'S NOT A HACK IT'S NOT THE APPLICATION OF A BREATHING PRACTICE TO SOMETHING THAT IT WASN'T INTENDED FOR IN FACT PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE WE'RE NOT DISCOVERE BY ME AT ALL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY PHYSIOLOGISTS IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WHO FOUND THAT WHEN PEOPLE UNDERBREATHE THEY HAVE A BUILD UP OF CARBONDOXIDE AN THEIR SYSTEM AND EVEN THOUGH CARBONDOXIDE IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE YOU DON'T WANT TOO MUCH OF IT IN YOUR SYSTEM AND THAT PEOPLE WHETHER NOT THEY WERE SLEEP OR AWAKE WOULD ENGAGE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE SPONTANEOUSLY SUBCONSCIOUSLY THE WOULD DO THIS DOUBLE INHAIL THROUGH THE NOSE AND EXTENDED EXALE THROUGH THE MOUTH AND THAT DID NOT JUST ELIMINATE EXCESS OF CARBONDOXIDE FROM THE SYSTEM IT ALSO REBALANCE THE OXYGEN CARBONDOXIDE RATIO IN THE PROPER WAYS IN FACT IT'S OBSERVED IN ANIMALS YOU MIGHT SEE THIS IN ANIMALS THAT ARE TIRED WHEN ANIMALS OR HUMANS GET TIRED THEY TEND TO START UNDERBREATHING A LITTLE BIT AND THAT CAN OFTEN DISRUPT THE BALANCE OF CARONOXIDE AN OXYGEN AND RIGHT BEFORE A DOG WILL GO DOWN FOR A NAP FOR INSTANC YOU'LL NOTICE THAT HEY'LL DO THIS DOUBLE IN HILL EXALE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE SLEEPING IF THEY HOLD THEIR BREATH FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHICH FRANKLY ALL OF US DO PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT SLEEP THEY WILL ENGAGE OF PONTANEOUS PHYSIOLOGICAL SIE DURING THE DAYTIME WE ARE OFTEN HOLDING OUR BREATH ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS AND THEIRE'S A STUDY ON THIS AN THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT LOBIT LATER WHERE WHEN PEOPLE TEX MESSAGE OR THEIRE EMAILING ALTHOUGH NOWADAYS PEOPLE ARE ARE MAINLY ON SOCIAL MEDIUM TEX MESYGEN THEY OFTEN ARE HOLDING THEIR BREATH ATHEY WILL FOLLOW A BREATH HOLD BY A PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE BECAUSE DURING THAT BREATH HOLD THEIR BUILDING UP THE LEVEL OF CARBONDOXIDE IN THEIR SYSTEM NOW MIND YOU I SPEND YOU KNOW CLOSE TO HALF AN HOUR TELLING YOU THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE OVERBREATHING AT REST AND THAT'S ALSO TRUE BUT PEOPLE OFTEN WILL SHIFT FROM OVERBREATHING TO UNDERBREATHING WHICH IS A TERRIBLE PATTERN SO PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE DONE EITHER AS A ONE OFF ONE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE TO CLAMP STRASS ARE REDUCE STRESS IN REAL TIME OR REPEATEDLY OVER FIVE MINUTES AS A PRACTICE THAT YOU DO EACH DAY IS GOING TO BE NOT JUST THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO APPROACH REDUCING STRESS AROUND THE CLOCK AND IN REAL TIME BUT ALSO THE ONE THAT'S HIGHLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE WAY THAT THE NERL CIRCUITS THE CONTROL BREATHING WERE DESIDE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE HAS SOME OTHER VERY USEFUL APPLICATIONS ONE OF THE MORE A I WOULD SAY USEFUL ONES AT LEAST TO THOSE OF YOU THAT EXERCIZE IS GOING TO BE THE USE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE SO CALLED SIDE STITCH SO YOU'V EVER BEEN RUNNING OR SWIMMING OR EXERCISING YOU FELT A CRAMP ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE CHANCES ARE DESPITE WHAT YOUR HYGHSCHOPE COACH TOLD YOU THAT RAISING YOUR ARMS ABOVE YOUR HEAD OR DRINKING LESS WATER BEFORE YOU EXERCIZE IS NOT GOING TO GET RID OF THAT CRAMP AND HERE'S WHY IT'S NOT A CRAMP AT ALL IF YOU RECALL THE CERVICAL THREE FOUR AND FIVE NERVES THAT GIVE RISE TO THE PHRENTIC NERVE AND GO DOWN AND INNERVATE YOUR DIAPHRAM WELL AS I MENTION BEFORE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THOSE NERVE FIBERS ACTUALLY COURSE INTO THE DIAPHRAM AND GO UP UNDERNEATH AND IT YOU RECALL EARLIER I ALS O SAID THAT THE DIAPHRAM SITS RIGHT ON TOP OF THE LIVER IN OTHER WORDS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE CENSORY INNERVATION OF THE DIAPHRAM THE DEEP DIAPHRAM AND THE LIVER AND THERE SOMETHING CALLED REFERENCE TO PAIN WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY HAVE THAT SIDE STITCH ON THEIR RIGHT HND SIDE SO IF YOUREVER EXERCISING IN YOU FEEL A CRAMP ON YOUR RIGHT HAND SIDE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT'S A GENUINE CRAMP BUT MORE LIKELY IS THE FACT THAT THAT RENIC NERVE CENSORY INNERVATION IS NOW BEING CARRIED UP TO YOUR BRAIN AND YOU ARE DETECTING SOME LOCAL OR REFERENCE TO PAIN IN THE LIVER AND IN THE DIAPHRAM NOW THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN YOUR DOING ANYTHING WRONG ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT BE BREATHING PROPERLY FOR RUNNING AT THAT MOMENT AND THAT'S WHAT GAVE RISE TO IT COULD BE SOME SPASMING OF THE PHRENIC NERVE OR SOME INEFFICIENT BREATHING DURING RUNNING WITH AN ENTIRE SERIES ON FITNESS WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALLOPING ONE OF THOSE EPISODES INCLUDED LOT OF INFORMATION ON BREATHING IT WAS THE EPISODE ON ENDURANCE ALTHOUGH BREATHING WAS A TOPIC THAT WAS THREAD THROUGH MULTIPLE EPISODES IN THAT SERIES YOU CAN FIND THAT SERIES THAT HUBORMAN LABED OT CALM TAKS A LOT ABOUT HOW TO BREATHE DURING RUNNING HOW TO BREATE DURING WEIGHT LIFTING ET CETERA BUT THE POINT FOR NOW IS THAT IF EVER YOURE EXPERIENCING THAT RIGHT SIDE SIDE STITCH I INCURGE YOU TO PERFORM THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE AND THE GOOD NEWS AS YOU CAN PERFORM IT WHILE STILL RUNNING OR WHILE STILL SWIMMING ALTHOUGH I SUPOSE WAS SWIMMING YOU MIGHT HAVE TO I MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS A BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU DN'T WANT IN HAL WATER ER WHILE SYCLING OR ANY TYPE OF ACTIVITY IF YOU'D PERFORM THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE GENERALLY TWO OR THREE TIMES WHAT WILL OCCUR IS THAT BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THE FIRING OF THE FRENIC NERVE AND IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THE CENSORY FEED BACK FROM THE CENSORY COMPONENT OF THE PRENIC NERVE BACK TO THE BRAIN YOU WILL EXPERIENCE AN ALLEVIATION OF THE PAIN FROM THAT RIGHT SIDE SIDE STITCH ANOTHER WORD YOU CAN GET RID OF SIDE CRAMPS DOING PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE JURING ACTIVITIES IN PARTICULAR DURING RUNNING ACTIVITIES NOW I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A SIDE STITCH ON THE LEFT SIDE CHANCES ARE THAT HAS TO DO WITH EXCESSIVE AIR OR FLUID IN YOUR STOMACH AND THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT THAT ALSO HAVE TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT THE FRENIC NERVE IS ITS BI LATERAL AND BRANCHES TO BOTH SIDES AND IS CATCHING CENSORY IN PUT ON THE LEFT SIDE FROM SOME OF THE LOCAL ORGAN S AND SENSORY INNERVATION OF THOSE ORGANS EY BUT IF YOU HAVE RIGHT SIDE SIDE STITCH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE DONE TWO OR THREE TIMES WHILE STILL RUNNING OUGHT TO RELEAVE THAT SIDE STITCH NOW AS LONG AS WERE TALKING ABOUT BREATHING AND THE PHRENIC NERVE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PHRENIC NERVE AND YOUR LIVER AND YOUR STOMACH AND SOME OF THE OTHER ORGANS IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BREATHING AND HART RATE THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC SO MUCH SO THAT I PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE BUT NONE THE LESS YOU NOW KNOW WHAT YOUR DIAPHRAM DOES RIGHT WHEN YOU INHALE YOUR DIAPHRM MOVES DOWN THAT'S RIGHT WHEN YOU CONTRACT YOUR DIAPHRAMENT MOVES DOWN IT CREATE SPACE FOR YOUR LONGS TO NHALE AN WHEN YOU EXHALE YOUR DIPHRME MOVES UP WELL WHEN YOU INHALE AND YOUR DIAPHRAME MOVES DOWN WHAT HAPPINS IS THERE'S MORE SPACE CREATED IN THE THERACIC CAVITY AND PARTICULARY IF YOUR ALSO BREATHING DEEPLY AND YOU'RE USING THOSE INTERCOSTILE MUSCLES TO EXPAND YOUR RIBS AS A CONSEQUENCE THE HEART ACTUALLY GETS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER IT'S A TEMPORARY IN LARGEMENT IN THE HEART BUT IT'S A REAL ENLARGEMENT ND AS A CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER BLOOD IS IN THE HEART IS NOW IN A LARGER VOLUME CAUSE THE HART GOT BIGGOER AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THAT BLOOD IS MOVING MORE SLOWLY THROUGH THAT LARGER VOLUME FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S MOVING MORE SLOWLY YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM DETECTS THAT AND SENDS A NORAL SIGNAL TO THE HEART TO SPEED THE HEART RATE UP IN OTHER WORDS INHALES INCREASE HEART RATE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE WHEN YOU EXHALE WHEN YOU EXHALE YOUR DIAPHRAME MOVES UP YOUR RIB CAGE TENDS TO MOVE INWARD A BIT AND YOU COMPACT THE HEART YOU REDUCE THE VOLUME OF THE HEART OVER ALL WHEN YOU REDUCE THE VOLUME OF THE HEART OVER ALL BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE HEART EXCELERATES BECAUSE IT'S A SMALLER VOLUME SO GIVING YOU NA BLOOD IS O MOVE MORE QUICKLY THROUGH THAT SMALL VOLUME YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM DETECTS THAT AND SENDS A SIGNAL TO SLOW THE HEART DOWN SO JUST AS INHALES SPEED THE HEART UP EXHALES SLOW YOUR HEART RATE DOWN NOW OF COURSE EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN DOUBLE UP ON INHALES ORE EVEN TRIPPLE UP ON INHALES SOONER OR LATER IF YOU INHALE YOU CAN HAVE TO EXHALE RIGHT AND THE CONVERSE IS ALSO TRUE OF COURSE SO WHAT IS THIS MEAN IN TERMS OF CONTROLLING YOUR HEART RATE WELL IT' SAY YOU ARE GOING IN FOR A BLOOD DRAW OR YOUR GOING OUT ON STAGE IN YOUR STRESS WHILE I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO A PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE MAY BE TOO PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE TO BRING YOUR LEVEL OF CALM UP IN YOUR LEVEL OF STRASTS DOWN NONE THE LESS IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON WHY YOU WANT TO QUICKLY REDUCE YOUR HEART RATER ECCELERATE YOUR HEART RATE FORSAKE OF PHYSICAL WORK OUT PUT OR TO CALM YOURSELF DOWN ADDITIONALLY NOT JUST USE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE WELL THEN YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INHALES AN EXHALES CONTROLLING HEART RATE IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR HEART RATE YOU CAN SIMPLY INHALE LONGER AND MORE VIGOROUSLY RELATIVE TO YOUR EXHALES AND IF YOU WANT TO DECREASE YOUR HEART RATE WELL THEN YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE YOUR EXHALES LONGER AND OR MORE VIGOROUS THAN YOUR INHALES IN FACT THIS PROCESS WHICH IS CALLED RESPITORY SCINAS A RHYTHMEA IS THE BASIS OF WHAT WE CALL HEART RATE VERY ABILITY HARTRA VERYBILDING INVALLS THE VAGUEST NERVE THE TENTH CRANIAL NERVE WHICH IS A PARI SYMPATHETIC NERVE THAT IS ASSOCIATE WITH THE CALMING ASPECT OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SLOWING YOUR HEART RATE DOWN BY EXTENDING YOUR EXHALES AND IT REALLY FORMS THE BASIS OF MOST ALL BREATHING PRACTICES IF YOU LOOK AT ANY BREATHING PRACTICES WHETHER NOTS WHIMHOFF BREATHING TUMO BREAHING CUNDOLINING BREATHING PRONIOM O BREATHING PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGHING SYCLIC SIGING AND ON AND ON AND ON IF YOU WERE TO MEASURE THE RATIO OF INHALES TO EXHALES AND THE VIGOR OF INHALES TO EXHALES WHAT YOUWOULD FAL INE IS THAT EACH ONE WOULD CREATE A NET INCREASE OR A NET DECREASE IN HEART RATE THAT COULD BE VERY ACCURATELY PREDICTED BY WHEATHER OR NOT THAT BREATHING PRACTICE EMPHASIZED INHALES EMPHASIZED EXHALES OR HAD THOSE TWO FEATURES INHALE AND EXHALE BE OF EQUAL DURATION AND INTENSITY IN FACT IF YOU WANTED TO EQUILIBRATE YOUR HEART RATE WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU WOULD DO BOXBREATH N BECAUSE INHAL HOLD EXHAL HOLD IS BY DEFINITION CREATING EQUAL DURATION INHALES AN EXHALES OF ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT VIGOR WHEN YOU DO A PHYSIOLOGICAL SIE OURE DOING TOO BIG INHALES WHICH I CON SPEED YOUR HEART RATE UP JUST A LOBIT WITHIN A LONG EXTENDED EXHALE THE EXHALE IN THE END IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE TWO INHALES EVEN WHEN COMBINED AND SO YOU GET A NET DECREASE IN HART RTE THE CALMING EFFECT AND THEN PRACTICEIS SUCH AS TOUMO BREATHING OR WHIMHOFF BREATHING OR SYCKLIC HYPER VENTILATION DEEP INHALES AN EXHALES THE INHALES ARE MORE VIGOROUS COMPARED TO THE MORE PASSIVE EXHALES ARE GOING TO LEAD TO INCREASES IN HEART RATE YETS SO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BREATHING AND HEART RATE IS AN ABSOLUTELY LAXTEP ONE WHERE YOUR HEART RATE FOLLOWS YOUR BREATHING YOUR HEART RATE AND YOUR BREATHING ARE IN INTIMATE DISCUSSION WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT WHERE ALWAYS AN FOREVER YOUR INHALES INCREASE YOUR HEART RATE YOUR EXHALES DECREASE IT NOW THIS FEATURE WHICH PHYSICIANS CALL RESPATORY SCIENESCES AY RHYTHMEA OR WE SOMETIMES HERE ABOUT MORE OFTEN NOWDAYS AS HEART RATE VERYABILITY IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE IN SPORT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT'S WHY FOR INSTANCE THAT MARKMAN WILL EXHALE JUST PRIOR TO TAKING A SHOT THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR PEOPLE THAT COMPETE IN THE BYATHLON WHERE THEY CROSS COUNTRY SCES OF THE HEART RATE IS UP UP UP UP UP THAN THEY'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO SHOO TO A TARGAN THEY'LL EXHALE AND THEN THEY'LL THEY'LL SHOOT THE TARGET THIS IS ALSO WHY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WANT O BRING YOUR HART RATE DOWN VERY QUICKLY BETWEEN ROUNDS OF MARSHAL ARTS THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT BUT AN EXTENDED EXHALE OF ANY KIND OR FRANKLY ANY BREATHING PRACTICE THAT EMPHASIZES EXHALES IS GOINGTO BRINGER HEART RATE DOWN THIS BEEN INCORPORATED IN NUMBER DIFFERENT CONTACTS INCLUDING SPORT MILITARY IT'S ALSO NOW BEING INCORPORATED IN THE CLINICAL CONTACTS FOR PEOPLE WHO FEEL A PANIC ATTACK COMING ON I'M VERY GRATIFIED TO LEARN THAT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE IS NOW BEING EXPLORED AS A TOOL TO PREVENT PANIC ATTACX AND ANXIETY ATTACS THIS IS PRIOR TO THE PANIC ATTACK PEOPLE BRINGING THEIR EART RATE DOWN AGAIN THOUGH THOSE EXTENDED EXHALES SO LEARNING TO EXTEND YOUR EXHALE IS REALLY A TERRIFIC SKILL TO MASTER AND IT'S VERY EASY SKILL TO MASTER FRANKLY WHY DO I SAY A KIL WILL REMEMBER WHAT I SAID EARLIER WHICH IS THAT HUMANS INHALE ACTIVELY AND MOST TYPICALLY WILL PASIVELY EXHALE JUST LET THE AIR DROP OUT OF THEM AT WHATEVER RATE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH AIR THEY INHALED ACTIVELY EXHALING THAT IS ACTIVELY RELAXING THE DIAPHRAM AND ACTIVELY RELAXING THOSE INTERCOSTULE MUSCLES OF THE CHEST THOSE ONE AT ERE I SHOULD SAY OF BETWEEN THE RIBS IS E SKILL THAT YOU CAN VERY QUICKLY ACQUIRE AND WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FRENTIC NERVEF THE DIAPHRAM THE SIZE OF THE HEART T THE HEART VOLUME AND ALL THAT STUFF TO REALLY TAKE CONTROL OF HEART RATE QUICKLY SO THAT IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR HEART IS RACING TOO MUCH AND FRANKLY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF WHAT'S CALLED INTERRECEPTIVE AWARENESS ESPECHE ANXIOUS PEOPLE THEY CAN REALLY SENSE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR BODY OTHER PEOPLE LESS SO I ON MY ON MY HEART'S BEATING IS THE RIP RAD ED JUMP OUT OF MY CHEST AND I DON'T LIKE THAT DON'T LIKE THAT BIG LONG EXHAL DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU DO IT THROUGH THE NOSE OR THE MOUTH BIG LONG EXHAILS CAN ALLOW YOU TO SLOW YOUR HEART RATE DOWN LET'S TALK ABOUT HICCUPS EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES HICCUPS FROM TIME TO TIME THINK MOST PEOPLEWOULD AGREE THAT ONE HICCUP SORT OF FUNNY TWO HICCUPS IN A ROW IS REALLY FUNNY AND THREE HICCUPS IN A ROW IS WHERE IT STARTS TO BE CONCERNING IN PART BECAUSE HICKCUPS CAN BE KIND OF PAINFUL THEXPERIENCE PAIN IN YOUR GOT TIYOUR A LOWER ABDOMIN AND SUMDIYES IN YOUR CHEST IS WELL IF YEEL'S KIND OF INTRUSIVE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF HAVING CONVERSATION OR JUST SITTING THERE IN RELAXING FORTUNATELY THERE'S A SIMPLE WAY TO GET RID OF HICCUPS AND YOU CAN ARRIVE AT THAT SIMPLE TECHNIQUE IF YOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT GIVES RISE TO HICCUPS THE REASON WE GET HICCUPS AT ALL IS BECAUSE WE EXPERIENCE A SPASM OF THE FHRENIC NERVE THE FRENTIC NERVE AS YOU RECALL IS A NERVE THAT EMANATES FROM THE SERVICAL REGION TO BE SPECIFIC SEE THREE FORE AN FIVE THOSE SPINAL NERVES GO DOWN COURSE BEHIND THE HEART AND INTERVATE THE DIAPHRAM WHICH IS THE MUSCLE THAT WHEN IT CONTRACTS IT MOVES DOWN ALLOWS ALONGS TO FILL AND THEN WHEN YOU RELAX THE DIAPHRAM THEN THE DIAPHRAM MOVES UP AND THE LONGS SHRINKER THEY EXPELL AIR SO CALLED EXHELLATION NOW THE FRENTIC NERVE ALSO HAS THAT SENSORY BRANCH SO IT'S NOT JUST INVOLVED IN CONTROLLING THE DIAPHRAM AT THE MOTOR LEVEL IT'S ALSO SENSING THINGS DEEP WITHIN THE DIAPHRAME AND IN THE LIVER AS WELC AS THE LIVERS IT'S RIGHT BELOW THE DIAPHRAM SO A HICCUP HAS THAT PAINFUL SENSATION FROM TIME TO TIME BECAUSE THERE'S A RAPID SENSORY FEED BACK OR A SIGNAL RATHER OF A SHARP CAND OF SENSATION OF CONTRACTION WITHIN THE DIAPHRAM AND THAT'S RELAID BACK TO THE BRAIN AND YOU CONSCIOUSLY PERCEIVE THAT AS A LITLE BIT OF PAIN AND THEN OF COURSE THE HICCUP IS THE THE HICCUP WHICH IS THE SPASM YO THE PHRENTIC NERVE THE EXPERENCE MORE LESS IN YOUR THROAT BUT ALL THIS REALLY IS HAPPENING ALONG THE FRENTIC NERVE AND TOWARD THE DIAPHRAM WHAT THIS ALL MEANS IS THAT IF YOU CAN STOP THE FRENTIC NERVE FROM SPASMING YOU CAN STOP HICCUPS THERE'RE A LOT OF APPROACHES THAT PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO TAKE TO ELIMINATE SPASMING OF THE FHRENTIC NERVE YOU'LL HEAR THAT YOU BREATHING INTO A BAG WHICH IS ONE WAY TO YOU RE INGEST OR RE INHAL CARBONDOXIDE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE EXPELLED OUT INTO THE VIREMENT CAN HELP THAT'S A VERY INDIRECT METHOD I RARELY WORKS FRANKLY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HAS TO DO MORE WITH ADJUSTING YOUR BREATHING TO TRY AND ADJUST THE ACTIVITY THE FHRENIC NERVE IT'S A REALLY ROUNDABOUT WAY OF TRYING TO A ALLEVIATE HICCUPS SOME PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE RELIEF FROM DRINKING FROM A GLASS OF WATER FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE GLASSES OR HAVE TO TILT OVER AT THE WAYST IT'S A KIND OF MESSY APPROACH AGAIN IT DOESN'T TEND TO WORK A LOT OF THE TIME FOR SOME PEOPLE AT WORKS EVERY TIME BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL HOWEVER THERE IS A TECHNIQUE THAT CAN RELIABLY ELIMINATE HICCUPS AND IT'S THE TECHNIQUE THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HYPER CONTRACTING THE FHRENIC NERVE OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT IT THEN SUBSEQUENTLY RELAXES OR ALLEVIATES THE SPASMING OF THE FHRENTIC NERVE AND THAT' SIMPLE METHOD IS TO INHALE THREE TIMES IN A ROW THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL PATTERN OF BREATHING BUT WHAT INVOLVES IS TAKEN BIG DEEP INHAL THROUGH YOUR NOSE THEN BEFORE YOU EXHAL ANY AIR TAKE A SECOND INHAL THROUGH THE NOSE HOWEVER BRIEF THAT INHALE MIGHT BE AND THEN A THIRD EVEN MICHRO OR MILL A SECOND LONG INHALE THROUGH YOUR NOSE TO GET THAT THIRD INHALE AND THEN HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SECONDS AND THEN SLOWLY EXHAIL SO EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT EXPERIENCING ANY HICCUPS RIGHT NOW I WILL DEMONSTRATE THE METHOD FOR ELIMINATE HICCUPS SO THA YOU'E ALL CLEAR ON HOW TO DO IT CY HERE I GO O KA SO IT'S THREE INHALES ALL THROUGH THE NOSE AND IT IS TRUE THAT THAT SECOND AND THIRD INHAL TAKE SOME PHYSICAL EFFORT TO REALLY GET ADDITIONAL AIR INTO THE LUNGS WITHOUT EXHALING FIRST IT FEELS LIKE IT THE ONLY WAY I CAN DESCRIBE IT REALLY IS AS A SHARP SECOND AND THIRD INHAL COUS YU REALLY HAVE TO ENGAGE THE MUSCULATURE OF THOSE INTRCOSTALE MUSCLES IN THE DIAPHRAM IN ORDER TO DO IT AND THEN THAT LONG EXHAL CAN BE THROUGH THE NOSE ORGH THE MOUTH BUT I FIND IT PARTICULARLY RELAXING OR EVEN PLEASANT TO DO IT THROUGH THE NOSE THIS METHOD OF THREE INHALES THROUGH THE NOSE FOLLOWED BY A LONG EXHAIL THROUGH THE NOSE OR MOUTH WILL ELIMINATE HICCUPS RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS IT HYPER IC CITES THE FRENIC NERVE THREE TIMES IN A ROW A VERY UNNATURAL PATTERN FOR THE FRENTIC NERVE TO FIRE AND THEN IT UNDERGOES A HYPER POLARIZATION AS WE CALL IT IN WHICH THE FRENTIC NERVE ACTUALLY STANDS A MUCH LOWER PROBABILITY OF GETTING ACTIVATED AGAIN FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME AFTERWARDS SO IT IS IMPORTANT THA YOU TRY IN RETURN TO NORMAL CADENTS OF BREATHING AFTER DOING THIS THREE INHALES FOLLOWED BY THE LONG EXHAIL IF YOU NEED TO PERFORM IT A SECOND TIME IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE HICCUPS BECAUSE THE'RE SIMPLY NOT GOING AWAY THAT'S FINE YOU CAN DO THAT BUT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THIS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT AND SCIENCE SUPPORTED WAY TO ELIMINATE HICCUPS NOW UP UNTIL NOW I'VE BEEN TALKTING ABOUT BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND I'VE MAINLY FOCUSS ON BREATHING TECHNIQUES THAT EMPHASIZE THE EXHAIL WHETHER NOT'S THE CARBONOXID TOLERANCE TEST WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SYCKLIC SIGHING OR THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE THAT USE IN REAL TIME TO REDUCE STRESS ONE THING THAT WE HAVE NEEN TALKED ABOUT SO MUCH IS SYCLIC HYPEREVENTILATION SICKLI CHYPER VENTILATION AS YOU RECALL IS ABOUT OF TWENTY FIVE OR SO BREATH INHALING DEEPLY THROUGH THE NOSE AND THEN PASSIVELY EXHALING OR SOMETIMES ACTIVELY EXHALING TYPICALLY THROUGH THE MOUTH SO IT MIGH LOOK LIKE THIS THAT'S A VERY ACTIVE INHAL THROUGH THE NOSE AND EXHEL THROUGH THE MOUTH IT CAN ALSO BE DONE ACTIVE INHALTHROUGH THE NOSE PASSIVE EXHAL THROUGH THE MOUTH LIKE SO IN ANY EVENT THAT PATTERN OF BREATHING REPEATED FOR TEN TO TWENTY FIVE BREATHS GREATLY INCREASE IS LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC ARALS IN FACT IT'S KNOWN TO DEPLOY A DRENOLIN FROM THE ADRINALS AND IN OUR STUDY WE HAD PEOPLE THEN EXPEL ALL THEIR AIR SO BREATHE OUT HOLD THEIR BREATH FOR FIFTEEN TO THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN REPEAT FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE MINUTES THAT DID LEAD TO SOME VERY INTERESTING AND POSITIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN TERMS OF STRESS MITIGATION ALTHOUGH NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AS WAS OBSERVED WITH SYCLIC SIGHING AS I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER NOW THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN CYCLICHYPER VENTILATION FORSAKE OF FOR INSTANCE EXTENDING BREATH HOLDS THIS IS BECOME POPULAR IN PART BECAUSE THE SO CALE D WHIM HOFF METHOD WHICH IS A METHOD THAT COMBINES BREATHING CYCLICHYPEROVENTILATION FOLLOWED BY LUNGSFULL OR LUNGS EMPTY BREATHHOLDS DEPENDING ON WHICH VARIANT OF THE WHIMHOFF METHOD ONE IS USING SEPARATELY AND I REALLY WANT EMPHASIZE SEPARATELY THEUG WHIMHOFF METHOD ALSO INVOLVES DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHICH IS ALL IF YOU KNOW I'M A BIG FHANO AND WE'VE DONE EPISODES THIS POD CAST ON N WE HAVE TOOL KETS ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FORN CREASING DOPOMINE LEVELS AP AN EFERAN LEVELS A MEAN SYSTEM FUNCTION ET CETERA WHIMHOFF METHOD ALSO IN CORPORATES THAT AND IT HAS A MINDFULNESS COMPONENT AN YOU WANT A CAUTION PEOPLE THAT ANY TIME YOU'RE DOING CYCLICHYPEROVENTILATION YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT NOT DOING IT IN OR NEAR WATER BECAUSE IT DOES GREATLY INCREASE THE RISK OF SHALL OR WATER BLACK OUT AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO CYCLICYPEROVENTILATION YOU ARE EXPELLING YOUR EXHAILING MORE CARBONDIOXIDE THAN USUAL AND WHAT I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU YET IS THAT THE TRIGGER TO BREATHE IS ACTUALLY AND INCREASE IN CARPBONDIOXIDE WHEN I MEAN BY THAT IS YOU HAVE A SMALL SET OF NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN STEM THAT CAN DETECT WHEN CARBONDOXIDE LEVELS IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL AND WHEN THEY REACH THAT LEVEL THEY TRIGGER THE GAS REFLECTS AND OR THE HUNGER FOR BRETHING IN OTHER WORDS WE DON'T BREATHE BECAUSE WE CRAVE OXYGEN ALTHOUGH WE DO NEED OXYGEN OF COURSE AN OR JUST SURRIVE AND FOR OUR BRAIN TO FUNCTION OR BODILY ORGANS TO FUNCTION BUT OUR BRAIN IS WIRED SUCH THAT IT HAS A THREAT CENSE OR WHICH IS CARBONDOXIDE LEVELS ARE GETTING TOO HIGH AND THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERS THE MOTOR REFLECTS TO BREATHE AND TO IN SOME CASES GASP FOR AIR DEPNDING ON HOW STARVED FOR AIR WE ARE SO IF YOU DU CYCLICHYPEROVENTILATION WHETHER NOTS WHIMHOFF METHOD OR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S TOOMO METHOD AGAIN THESE THINGS ARE SIMILAR THERE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME THERE ARE OTHER BREATHING METHODS THAT INCORPORATE CYCLICYPEROVENINTILATION W OU'RE DOING AS YOU'RE GETTING RID OF A LOT OF CARBONDOXIDE AND THEREFORE YOU'R REMOVING THE IMPULSE OR LOWERING THE IMPULSE TO BREATE SO THAT WHEN YOU ENTER THAT BREATHHOLD PHASE AFTER THE HYPEROVENTLATION IT'S A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE YOU FEEL THE ANXIETY IND THE HUNGER IN THE IMPULSE TO BREATHE THAT'S ONE OF THE REAL BENEFITS OF ANY TECHNIQUE THAT INCORPORATE CYCLICYPEROVENTILATION IS THAT RATHER THAN REDU SS YOUR STRESS LEVEL IN REAL TIME IT ACTUALLY DOES THE OPPOSITE IT INCREASES YOUR STRESS LEVEL INCREASES YOUR LEVELOF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL BUT YOUR DOING IT DELIBERATELY AND THEN DURING THOSE BREATH HOLDS WHAT'S HAPPENING AS YOU HAVE A LOT OF A DRENOLINE CIRCULATING IN YOUR SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE HYPEROVENTILATION TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF A DRENALINE FROM YOUR DRENAL GLANDS IT ALSO TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF EPINEPRON WHICH IS THE SAME AS A DRENALIN FROM AN LOBRANARICAL LOCUS SERULIS WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL MORE ALERT AND THEN DURING THOSE BREATH HOLDS AND IN THE SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF CYCLICYPEROVENTILATION PEOPLE EXPERIENCE WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A LOT OF A DRENOLIN IN THEIR SYSTEM BUT THEY ARE CONTROLLING THE RELEASE OF THAT ADRENOLINE WHICH IS FAR AN AWAY DIFFERENT THAN WHEN LIFE EVENTS ARE TRING THAT A DRENOLINE SO WHAT IT REALLY IS IS A FORM OF SELF INDUCED STRESS AND OCULATION AND I DO THINK THERE ARE BENEFITS TO PRACTISING CYCLICYPEROVENTILATION BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO LEARN HOW TO SELF DEPLOY A DRENOLINE AND EPINEFRON FROM LOCUS SERULIUS AND FROM THE ADDRENALS ARITE GOT THAT BACKWARDS A DRENALINE FROM YOUR DRENALS AN EPONEPRON FROM LOCUS SERULUS AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO EXPLORE WHAT IT IS TO MAIN TAIN CALM STATE OF MIND IN BODY WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF A DRENALINE IN YOUR SYSTEM WHICH CERTAIN STUDIES ARE STARTING TO SHOW CAN ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LEAN IN TO THE STRESSFUL ASPECTS OF LIFE AND LETS BEONES LIFE IS STRESSFUL IN ANY EVENT OW WE'RE ALL GOING TO EXPERIENCE STRESS AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER AND WHEN WE DO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT OVERTAKN BY THE RELEASE OF A DRENALINE FROM THE ADDRENALS THAT SUDDEN SURGE OF EPINPRON FROM LOCUSRULIUS SO DOING CYTIC CYPEROVENILATION BE ONE OR TWO TIMES PER WEEK AGAIN TWENTY FIVE BREASTS ACTIVE INHIL PASSIVE OR ACTIVE EXHAL DO EXPECT TO FEEL TINGLY BECAUSE OF THAT REDUCTION AND CARBONOXIDE FROM EXSAILING SO MUCH DO EXPECT TO FEEL LOBIAGITATED BE VERY CAREFUL DOING THIS OF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO HAS ANXIETY ATTACKS OR SOMEBODY WHO HAS PANIC ATTACKS OR DISORDERS OF ANY KIND BUT IF YOU DON'T IN YOU WANT O EXPLORTHIS YOU'LL NOTICE YOU START TO FEEL REALLY RAMPED UP AND THEN DURING THE BREATH HOLDS WHICH AGAIN CAN BE DONE BY EXHAILING AND STOPPING FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME FIFTEEN MAYBEVEN SIXTY SECONDS IS A TIME IN WHICH YOU CAN EXPLORE HOW TO REEMAIN MENTALLY CALM SOME PEOPLE IV EN CHOOSE TO DO MATH PROBLEMS OR THINK OF THINGS IN A KIND OF STRUCTURED WAY WHILE THEY HAVE A LOT OF THESE HORMO NARROW TRANSMITTER CIRCULATING AT HIGH LEVELS IN THEIR SYSTEM IN OTHER WORDS AS A WAY TO LEARN TO MANAGE YOUR MIND AND BODY UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS NOW IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHOSE USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ATHER COLD SHOWERS OR I SPAS OR COLD IMMERSION I OFTEN GET ASKED HOW BEST TO BREATHE DURING THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES REALLY THERE'S NO BEST WAY TO BREATHE ALTHOUGH IF YOU WANTED TO TURN THOSE ACTIVITIES INTO THEIR OWN FORM OF STRESS AND OCULATION AGAIN PLEASE DON'T UCYCLICYPEROVENTILATION IT'S DANGEROUS I DON'T RECOMMEND IT WHATSOEVER BUT YOU CAN TRY TO ACTIVELY SLOWIER BREATHING THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ENGAGING IN RHYTHMIC BREATHING NOW UP UNTIL NOW I'VE SAID THAT RHYTHMIC BREATHING IS THE DE EFAULT PREBOUGT SING OR NEWCALIOS CONTROLLING RHYTHMIC BREATHING IS THE DEFAULT AND THAT DOUBLING UP ON INHALES AND EXHALES IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DELIBERATELY TAKE OVER THE ACTION OF PREBUTSINGER COMPLEX NOW THAT'S TRUE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME HOWEVER THERE ARE CERTAIN CONDITION SUCH AS CONDITIONS OF HEIGHTEN STATE OF EMOTIONAL AROUSAL AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT SOMEBODYU'SE BEEN TRYING OFTENTIMES THEY'LL DO THE DOUBLE INHALE EXALE THATIS AS OR TRIPLE INHALES OR I SOMEBODY'S VERY VERY AFRAID IT'S ALL INHALES O HA SO IT DOES SOMETIMES HAPPENS SPONTANEOUSLY ACTIALY WHEN WE GET INTO VERY COLD WATER THERE'S A VERY ROBUST DECREASE IN THE ACTIVATION OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS WHICH IS THE AREA OF BRAIN REAL ESTATE RIGHT BEHIND THE FOREHEAD THAT CONTROLS STRUCTURE THINKING YOUR ABILITY TO REASEIN AND MAKE SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON YOU GET INTO REALLY COLD WATER YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT THAT BRAIN REGION TO WORK HERE T LEAST NOT WORK VERY WELL AT ALL FOR THE FIRST TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS THAT YOU'RE IN THE COLD WATER FROM THE TIME YOU GET INTO COLD WATER IS HERE WHR I MAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRYING CONTROL YOUR BREATHING AND MAKE IT RHYTHMIC THAT IS INHALES FOLLOW EXHALES FOLLOW INHALES FOLLOW EXHALES EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO BE FAST INHALE EHALE INHALE EXHAL WHY BECAUSE THE DEFAULT WHEN WE GET INTO A STRESSFUL CIRCUMSTANCE EMOTIONLLY AR PHYSICALLY TRESTFUL CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT RHYTHMIC BREATHING STOPS AND THAT PARIFICIAL NEUCLEUS TAKES OVER AND IT'S AND IT'S THAT CONOPANICY MODE AND BY SIMPLY CONTROLLING OUR BREATH AGAIN EVEN IF IT'S FAST FROM INHAL TO EXHAL AND MAKING SHURE THAT WERE ALTERNATING INHALES AND EXHALES RHYTHMICALLY AND WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THAT WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A VERY STRESSFUL CIRCUMSTANCE AND MAKE IT LESS TRESSFUL OR MAYBE EVEN PLEASANT AND THAT SKIL DEFINITELY TRANSLATES TO OTHER ASPECTS OF LIFE IN WHICH NOW YOUR HIT SQUARE IN THE FACE WITH SOMETHING STRESSFUL YOU'LL NOTICE YOUR BREATHING AND YOUR PATTERN OF BREATHING SWITCHING TO MULTIPLE INHALES OR YOU KNOW BREATH HOLDING ESSENTIALLY DEPARTING FROM RHYTHMIC BREATHING AND BY QUICKLY RETURNING TO RHYTHMIC BREATHING AND MAYBE VEN TRYING TO SLOW THE BREATHING AND EXTEND THOSE EXHALS YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU CAN VERY QUICKLY CALMDOWN NEXT ID LIKE TO DISCUSS WHAT I FIND IT BE IN ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING TOPIC IT'S ALSO ONE THAT'S HIGHLY USEFUL IN THE WORLD WHICH IS HOW YOUR SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF BREATHING RELATE TO YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN AND TO REMEMBER INFORMATION HOW IT CAN MODULATE FEAR AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ASPECTS OF HOW YOUR BRAIN FUNCTIONS THIS IS A LITERATURE THAT'S BEEN REVIEWED RECENTLY IN A LOT OF EXQUISITE DETAIL IN A BEAUTIFUL REVIEW BY JACKFELDMEN WHO I MENTION EARLIER ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF THE NUROW SCIENCE OF BREATHING THE TITLE OF THE REVIEW IS BREATHING RHYTHM AND PATTERN AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON AMOTION AGAIN WE'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS REVIEW IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS THIS REVIEW INCLUDES DISCUSSION OF SEVERAL STUDIES A ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT I'LL AM GET INTO IN A BIT OF DETAIL THAT DESCRIBES THE FOLLOWING RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT YOU TO BREATHE REGULARLY MEANING RHYTHMIC LY YOU CAN INHALE AN EXHEL THROUGH YOUR MOUTH OR THROUGHYOUR KNOWSE THAD PREFER THAT YOU DO IT THROUGH YOUR NOSE BECAUSE NASAL BREATHING UNLESS YOU NEED TO BREATH THROUGH YOUR MOUTH BECAUSE OF HARD EXERCISE OR EATING OR TALKING IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE BETTER WAY TO GO NASAL BREATHING IMPROVES THE ESETIC OF YOUR FACE THAT'S BEEN SHOWN WILL HUOK ABOUT THAT JUST BRIEFLY IN A FEW MINUTES NASAL BREATHING IMPROVES THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN YOU CAN BRING INTO YOUR SYSTEM ET CETERA ET CETERA ACA SO JUST BREATHE INHALE EXHEL IN HILL EXEL AND KNOW THAT JURING YOUR EXHALES YOUR PUPIL THAT IS THE PUPIL OF YOUR EYE IS GETTING BIGGER AND AS YOU EXHALE IT'S GETTING SMALLER IN ADDITION WHEN YOU INHALE YOUR REACTION TIME TO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS AROUND YOU A CAR SWERVING IN FRONT OF YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT DETECT IN THE PERFERY OF YOUR VISION OR HERE OFF IN THE DISTANCE INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO WHEN YOU'RE EXHALING IN ADDITION WHEN YOU ARE INHALING YOUR ABILITY TO REMEMBER THINGS ESPECIALLY THINGS THAT TAKE A BIT OF EFFORT TO REMEMBER AND YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN NEW INFORMATION IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN IT IS WHEN YOU'RE EXHALING NOW AS YOU HEAR ALL THAT YOU'RE POBABLY THING YO'LL GET HOW TO I JUST INHALE OF COURSE THAT'S NOT KN TO BE THE BEST APPROACH YOU NEED EXHALE AS WELL FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU NOW ARE WELL AWARE OF BUT WHAT THESE FINDINGS REALLY ILLUSTRATE AND I SHULD MENTION THESE FINDINGS ARE ALL CARRIED OUT INHUMANS RITES THESE RELATE TO SOME STUFF IN ANIMAL STUDIES BUT WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED HAS BEEN SHOWN INHUMAN STUDIES CONSISTENTLY WHEN WE INHALE AND IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE INHAL THROUGH OUR NOSE OUR BRAIN IS NOT FUNCTIONING IN THE SAME WAY AS WHEN WE EXHAL NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT OUR BRAIN IS FUNCTIONING IN A DEFICIENT WAY WHEN WE EXHAL IT JUST DOESNIT FUNCTION AS WELL AS IT RELATES TO MEMORY RETRIEVAL MEMORY FORMATION AND SOME OTHER ASPECTS OF COGNITION NOW YOU MIGHT BE ASKING WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THIS BE WELL I WASN'T CONSULTED THAT THE DESIGN PHASE AND ANY ONE THAT TELLS YOU THAT THEY WERE YOU SHOULD BACK AWAY FROM QUICKLY BUT ONE REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR WIRE BRAIN FUNCTIONS BETTER AT LEAST IN THE CONTECTS OF WHAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE INHALE IS BECAUSE THE OLD FACTORY SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY THE MOST ANCIENT SENSORY SYSTEM OF ALL THE SENSORY SYSTEMS WE HAVE SO BEFORE VISION BEFORE ADITION BEFORE TOUCH BEFORE ALL OF THAT THE OLD FACTORY SYSTEM IS THE MOST ANCIENT SYSTEM AND THE OLD FACTORY SYSTEM OF COURSE IS DESIGNED TO DESET CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO IF YOU IMAGINE AN EARLY ORGANISM THAT PERHAPS WE HAVE ALL FROM OR PERHAPS WE DIDN'T BUT NONE THE LESS THAT WE SHARE SOME FEATURES OF AT LEAST IN TERMS OF ALL FACTORY FUNCTION IN ORDER TO GET THAT CHEMICAL INFORMATION INTO THE BRAIN WOU NEED TO INHAL NEED TO BRING THAT INFORMATION IT NOW FOR A QUATIC ANIMALS THEY COULD TAKE IT IN THROUGH WATER BUT FOR ANIMALS THAT ARE TERRESTRIAL LEM ON LAND THEY OUD HAVE TO GET ITHROUGH THE AIR SO INHALATION WE KNOW ACTIVATE CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE SOCAL PUREFORM CORT CIES ARE AREAS OF THE NEOLQUARTECHS THAT ARE MORE ANCTION AS WELL AS INCREASING THE ACTIVITY OF BRAINAREAS SUCH AS THE HYPPOCAMPUS HICH IS A BRAINARIINVOLVED IN LEARNING YOUR MEMORY IN FACT ONE OF THE STUDIES THAT ILLUSTRATES THIS MOST BEAUTIFULLY IS A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF NERL SCIENCE IM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BY THE WAY JOURNAL NURCIENCE IS A VERY FINE JOURNAL AND THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS NASAL RESPIRATION IN TRAINS HUMAN LIMBIC OSCILLATIONS AND MODULATES COGNIVE FUNCTION THIS IS A PAPER THAT FOLLOWED UP ON AN EARLIER PAPER THAT SHOWED THAT WHEN PEOPLE BREATHE IN THROUGH THEIR NOSE THEIR RECOGNITION AND THEIR DISCRIMINATION OF DIFFERENT ODORS WAS FAR GREATER THAN WHEN THEY BREATHED IN THROUGH THEIR MOUTH NOW THAT WAS ALWAYS INTERESTING BUT IT WAS ALSO SORT OF A DOVE BECAUSE YOU SMELL THINGS WITH YOUR NOSES NOT YOUR MOUTH YOU TASTE THINGS WITH YOUR MOUTH AND YOU SPEAK WITH YOUR MOUTH AN THEIR MUNCH OF OTHER THINGS YOU DO WITH YOUR MOUTH BUT NONE THE LESS THAT STUDY POINTED TO THE IDEA THAT THE BRAIN IS DIFFERENT DURING NASAL INHILATIONS VERSES NASAL EXHILLATIONS VERSES MOUTH IN HILATIONS VERSES EXHILLATIONS WHAT IT BASIS SHOWED IS THAT THE BRAIN RAMPS UP ITS LEVELS OF ACTIVITY AND THAT SIGNALED NOISE THT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER FYOU RECALL THAT ABILITY FOR THE BRAIN TO DETECT THINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS INCREASED DURING IN HILATIONS BUT BECAUSE THAT EARLIER STUDY FOCUSED ON SMELL ON ALL FACTION THERE WAS A BIT OF A CONFOUND THERE WAS HARD TO SEPARATE OUT THE VARIABLE SO THIS PAPER THE ONE I JUST MENTION NASAL RESPIRATION AN TRANS HUMAN LIMIC OSCILLATIONS MODELY'S COGNIT FUNCTION DID NOT LOOK AT DETECTION OF ODORS RATHER IT LOOKED AT THINGS LIKE REACTION TIME OR FEAR AND BASICALLY WHAT IT FOUND IS THAT REACTION TIME IS GREATLY REDUCED WHEN PEOPLE ARE INHALING SO THEY HAD PEOPLE LOOK AT FEARFUL STIMULATE THEY LOOKD AT THEIR REACTION TIME TO FEARFUL STIMULAE ANOTHER WORDS THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT CERTAIN KINDS OF STIMULE AND THEY WERE GIVEN A LOT DIFFENT KINDS OF STIMULES AT HEAD TO YOU BE ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN ONE SORT OF OPSCUSE ME ONE HYE BY THE WY FOXS FOR THOSE LOSANDES BUMPE THE MICRHROTE GETTING RATHER ANIMATED HERE WHAT THE SUBJECTS HAD TO DO WAS DETECT ONE TYPE OF STIMULUS FOR S ANOTHER STIMULUS THAT THEY WERE BEING EXPOSED TO AND WHAT THEY FOUND AS IF PEOPLE WERE INHALING AS THAT FEAR INDUCING STIMULUS WAS PRESENTED THEIR REACTION TIME TO NOTICE IT WAS MUCH MUCH FASTER AND THEY RELATED THAT TO PATTERNS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTUALLY RECORDING FROM THE BRAIN DIRECTLY FROM BENEATH THE SKULL AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE TEY HAD SOMEPATIONS THET HAD INTRCRANIAL ELECTRODES IMBEDDED IN THEIR BRAIN FOR SAKE OF TRYING TO DETECT EPILEPTIC SEIZURES SO THERE WIS A LOT TO THIS STUDY AND A LOT THAT WE COULD DISCUSS BUT THE BASIC TAKE AWAY IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE INHALING THAT IS WHEN THEIR DRAWING AR IN THROUGH THEIR NOSE IN PARTICULAR THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM IS GREATLY ENHANCED AND NOT JUST FOR FEAR BUT ALSO FOR SURPRISE OF ALL SORTS SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE INHALING THEIR ABILITY TO DETECT NOVEL STIMULE THINGS THAT AR UNEXPECTED OR THAT ARE UNUSUAL IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED YEN WE'LL PUT A LINK TO THIS STUDY AS WELL I FIND IT TO BE ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING STUDIES IN THIS REALM ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NOW MANY ADDITIONAL STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THIS STATEMENT THAT I MADE EARLIER WHICH IS THAT JURING INHALATION ALSO CALLED INSPIRATION THERE ARE NUMBER OF VERY FAST PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES SUCH AS CHANGES IND PUPIL DIAMETER CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITY OF THE HYPOCAMPUS THIS MEMORY IN CODING AND RETRIEVAL AREA THE BRAIN AND OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAIN SO WHAT'S THE TOOL TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IF YOU ARE SITTING DOWN TO READ OR RESEARCH OR STUDY OR YOU REALLY ONE O LEARN SOME IN FORMATION MAY BEOUR LISTENING TO A PODCAST OR SOME OTHER SORTS OF INFORMATION THAT YOU WANT A RETAIN IT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE TO INCREASE THE DURATION OR THE INTENSITY OF YOUR INHALES AS YOU DO THAT THE MORE THAT YOUR INHALING RELATIVE TO EXHALING IN TERMS OF DURATION THE MORE THAT YOUR BRAIN IS IN THIS FOCUSSED MODE AND THIS MODE OF BEING ABLE TO ACCESS AND RETRIEVE INFORMATION BETTER NOW THERE'S ONE CAVIAT TO THIS THAT I THNK IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE LISTEN TO THIS PODCAST FOR SAKE OF GLEANING TOOLS NOTJUS FOR COGNIVE ENHANCEMENT FOR PHYSICAL ENHANCEMENT IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE INHALING AIR YOU'RE ACTUALLY LESS ABLE OR I SHOULD SAY LESS EFFICIENT AT GENERATING VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS NOW THAT MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE YOU KNOW UNTIL NOW WE BASELY BEEN TALKING ABOUT INHALATION IS GREAT ALMOST OF THE POIN WHERE YOU WONDER LIKE HIS EXHELLATION GOOD FOR ANYTHING O YOU DON'T OVERBREATHE AND KICK OUT TO MUCH CARMONDOXIN WILL OF COURSE EXHELATION IS GREAT FOR THINGS IN FACT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY THAT'S PLAYED BASEBALL OR SOFTBALL WHAT WHAT RE YOU TOLD THAT YOU SHOULD EXHALE ON THE SWING TO GENERATE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POWER IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO HAS DONE MARTIAL ARTS OF ANY KIND WAS TRADITIONAL WESTERN BOXING AS YOU STRIKE THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE TYPICALLY DO THE THAT THE HAYAH LAY IN THE SORTOF CLASSIC CORATI TYPE THING THAT'S MORE OF A MOVY THING I DON'T KNOW WHETHE OR NOT PEOPLE ASHALY USE THE HIYA BUT IN BOXING OFTENTIMES PEOPLE D DO THE S YOU KNOW THEY'L L DO IT A RAPID EXHELLATION A FORCEFUL EX EXHELATION KEEPING IN MIND AGAIN THAT INHALES TYPICALLY OR ACTIVE THE ENGAGED THE DIAPHROMATIC MUSCLE THEY ENGAGE THOSE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES WHEREAS EXHALES TAN TO BE PASSIVE UNLESS WE TAKE ACTIVE CONTROL OF THE EXHALE AND INDEED OURABILITY TO GENERATE FAST DIRECTED SO CALLED VOLITIONAL VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS IS GREATLY ENHANCED IF WE DO THEM DURING THE EXHALE NOT THE INHALE NOW WITH ALL OF THAT SAID I HAVEN'T YET REALLY TALKED ABOUT MOUTH FOR SIS AND ASAL BREATHING AND IT REALLY CAN BE A FAIRLY SHORT DISCUSSION BECAUSE WHAT ABUNDANT DATA NOW SHOW AND HAS BEEN BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK CALLED JAWS A HIDDEN EPIDEMIC THIS IS A BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN BY PAUL EARLIC AND SANDRA CON MY CALLINGS AT STAMFORT SCHOOL MEDICINE HAS AND INTRODUCTION AND A FORWARD FROM JERODIMOND AND FROM THE GEAT ROBERTS SUPPOLSKI SOS REAL HEAVY HITTERS ON THIS BOOK WHAT THAT BOOK REALLY DESCRIBES IS THAT WHENEVER POSSIBLE MEANING UNLESS YOUR SPEAKING OR EATING OR YOUR EXERCISING OR OTHER ACTIVITIES REQUIRE SOME CHANGE IN YOUR PATTERN OR BREATHING WE SHOULD REALLY ALL BE STRIVING TO BREATHE THROUGH OUR NOSE NOT THROUGH OUR MOUTH AND THAT RELATES TO THE INCREASE RESISTANCE TO BREATHING THROUGH THE NOSE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AGAIN I'LL SAY AT A THIRD TIME THAT INCREASE RESISTANCE THROUGH THE NOSE ALLOWS YOU TO INFLATE YOUR LUNGS MORE NOT LESS THE OTHER THING THAT BREATHING THROUGH YOUR NOSE ALLOWS YOU TO DO IS IT BOTH WARMS AND MOISTURISES THE AIR THAT YOU BRING INTO YOUR LUNGS WHICH IS MORE FAVORABLE FOR LONG HEALTH THAN BREATHING THROUGH THE MOUTH HORD BREATHING THROUGH THE MOUTH OR SIMPLY MOUTH BREATHING AT ALL AS ACTUALLY QUITE DAMAGING OR CAN BE I SHOULD SAY QUITE DAMAGING TO SOME OF THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS OF YOUR LUNGS THAT OF COURSE DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BREATHE HARD THROUGH YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOUR RUNNING OR SPRINTING YOUR EXERCISING HARD BUT YOU DON'T WANT MOUTH BREATHING TO BE THE CHRONIC DEFAULT PATTERN THAT YOU FOLLOW NASAL BREATHING IS THE BEST PATTERN OF BREATHING TO FOLLOW AS A DEFAULT STATE ANOTHER ASPECT OF NASAL BREATHING THAT'S REALLY BENEFICIAL IS THAT THE GAS NITRICOXIDE IS ACTUALLY CREATED IN THE NASAL PASSAGES IT'S A GAS THAT CAN CAUSE RELAXATION OF THE SMOOTH MUSCLE THAT RELATE TO THE VASCULATURE NOCIOUS OF YOUR NOSE BUT OF YOUR BRAIN AND FOR ALL THE TISSUES OF YOUR BODY THIS IS WHY NASAL BREATHING AND NOT MOUTH BREATHING IS GREAT FOR WHEN YOU WANT A RELIEVE CONGESTION SO A LOT OF THE SING SEEN COUNTEAR INTUITIVE IT YOUR NOSES STUFFS SO  THAT MAINLY MAKES PEOPLE BREATHE THROUGH THEIR MOUTH BUT TURNS OUT THE BREATHING THOUGH YOUR NOSE WILL ALLOW SOME DILATION OF THE VASCULATURE MORE BLOOD FLOW DILATION OF THE NASAL PASSAGES AND DELIVERY OF NITROGOXIDE TO ALL THE TISSUES OF YOUR BODY AND THAT DILATION OF THE SMALL CAPALARIES THAT INERVATE ESENTIALLY EVERY ORGAN OF YOUR BODY ALLOW THE DELIVERY OF MORE NEUTRANS AND THE REMOVAL OF CARMODIOXIDE AND OTHER WASTE PRODUCTS FROM THOSE TISSUES MORE READILY THAN IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH A EXCUSE ME NITROCOXIDE INTO YOUR SYSTEM AS SO A LOT OF BREATHONS TO BE A NASAL BREATHE IF YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THAT BOOK JAWS A HIDDEN EPIDEMICS THE TERRIFIC READ AND IT ALSO SHOWS SOME ABSOLUTELY STRIKING PICTURES TWIN STUDIES AND SO FORTH AND SOME BEFORE AND AFTERS OF PEOPLE AND THE ESTHETIC CHANGES THAT THEY EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY SHIFTED FROM BEING A MOUTH BREATHER TO A NOSE BREATHER THESE ARE STRIKING EXAMPLES THAT AV BEEN OBSERVED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN PEOPLE MOUTH BREATHE THERE'S AN AN ALONGATION OF THE JAW DROOPINESS OF THE OF THE EYELIDS AND THE ENTIRE JAW STRUCTURE REALLY CHANGES IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT ESTHETICALLY FAVORABLE FORTUNATELY WHEN PEOPLE SWITCH BE COMING NASAL BREATHERS AND OF COURSE THAT TAKES SOME ENCOURAGEMENT EITHER BY MOUTH TAPING OR DOING THEIR CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE WITH MOUTH CLOSE OR BY DOING THE SORTS OF EXERCISES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHEN THEY SWITCH YOU BECOMING NASAL BREATHERS BY DEFAULT THE ESTHETIC CHANGES THAT OCCUR ARE VERY DRAMATIC AND VERY FAVORABLE INCLUDING YEUS OR ELEVATION OF OF THE EYEBROWS NOT NOT IN AN ARTIFICIAL SENSE OR IN IT KIND OF OUTRAGEOUS WAY BUT ELEVATION OF THE CHEEK BONES SHARPENING OF THE JAW AND MOST NOTABLY IMPROVEMENTS OF THE TEETH AND THE ENTIRE JAW STRUCTURE IN FACT ONE SIMPLE TEST OF WHETHER NOT YOU CAN BE AN EFFICIENT NASAL BREATHER AND WHETHER NOT YOU BEEN NASAL BREATHING EFFICIENTLY OR MOST OF THE TIME IN THE PASTOR WHETHER NOT YOU BEEN RELYING MORE ON MOUTH BREATHING THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK JAWS IS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLOSE YOUR MOUTH AND BREATHE ONLY THROUGH YOUR NOSE AN THIS IS AT RAST NOT DURING EXERCISE NECESSARILY LE MIGHT DO DURING EXERCISE BUT CLOSE YOUR MOUTH PUT YOUR TONGUE ON THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH AND IT SHOULD FIT BEHIND YOUR TEETH AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO NOSE BREATHE IN THAT POSITION A MANY PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT FORTUNATELY AS IT MENTIONED EARLIER IF YOU NASAL BREATHE THAT IS YOU DELIBERATELY NAZAL BREATHE WHEN AT REST FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME YOU WILL EXPERIENCE AND INCREASED ABILITY TO NAZAL BREAHE AND YOU SHOULD ALSO EXPERIENCE SOME ADITION OF SPACE WITHIN THE PALLID OF YOUR MOUTH TO ALLOW YOUR TONGUE TO SIT MORE COMPLETELY ON THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH THIS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR CHILDREN THAT PERFORM THIS TECHNIQUE AGAIN I REFER YOU TO THE BOOK JAWS A HIDDEN EPIDEMIC IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR BOOK YOU CONALSOGGUST AND LOOK ON LINE BEFORE AND AFTER JAWS HIDDEN EPIDEMIC AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE CHANGES AN FACIAL STRUCTURE THAT OCCUR WHEN PEOPLE MOVE FROM MOUTH TO NAZAL BREATHING AND ITS REALLY QUITE STRIKING SO DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE PER ALWAYS WE COVERED A LOT OF INFORMATION FIRST WE TALKED ABOUT THE MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING THE LUNGS THE DIAPHRAM THE TRAKIA AND SO FORTH WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING THAT REALLY BREATHING IS A WAY THAT WE BRING OXYGEN TO OURSELVES AND THAT WE GET THE CORRECT LEVELS OR I SHOUD THAT WE MAINTAIN THE CRRECT LEVELS OF CARBONDOXIDE IN OUR SYSTEM NEITHER TOO MUCH NORE TOO LITTL IN ORDER TO ALLOW OXYGEN TO DO ITS MAGIC END TO ALLOW CARBONDOIDE TO DO ITS MAGIC BECAUSE AS YOU LEARN DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE CARBONDIOXIDE IS NOT JUST A WASTE BY PRODUCT IT HAS VERY CRITICAL PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS YOU NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH OF IT AROUND AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERBREATHE ESPECIALLY AT REST WE TALKED ABOUT A TOOL TO MEASURE HOW WELL YOU MANAGE CARBONDOXIDE THE SO CALL CARBONDIOXIDE TOLERANCE TEST AND VARIOUS EXERCISES THAT YOU CAN USE SIMPLY BY BREATHING TO DECREASE YOUR STRESS IN REAL TIME DECREASE YOUR STRESS CHRONICALLY AROUND THE CLOCK OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A GOOD THING IMPROVE SLEEP AND PROVE MOOD HOW TO INCREASE BREATH OLD TIMES AND WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT ALSO HOW TO ELIMINATE HICCUPS WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO BREATHE IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE SIDE STITCH OR SIDECRAMP THT YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE DURING EXERCISE AND HOW TO BREATHE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE LEARNING AND MEMORY REACTION TIME AND VARIOUS OTHER ASPECTS OF COGUTIVE AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION I DO REALIZE IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT AS ALWAYS I TRY AND GIVE YOU INFORMATION THAT IS CLEAR HOPEFULLY INTERESTING AS WELL AND ACTIONABLE TOWARD A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT END POINTS SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY THATS JUST NOW STARTING TO THINK ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF BREATH WORK I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE YES DO THAT'S CARBONDOXIDE TOLERANCE TEST THAT WILL GIVE YOU SOME WINDOW IN TO HOW WELL OR HOW POORLY YOUR MANAGING BREATHING AND THEN HEARS THE GREAT NEWS THE GREAT NEWS IS TH T BREATH WORK THAT IS DELIBERATE RESPIRATION PRACTICES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AT CREATING CHANGE VERY QUICKLY IN SOME CASES SUCH AS THE USE OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SI OR SICLIC HAPROVENTILATION THOSE CHANGES CAN BE EXPERIENCED THE FIRST TIME AND EVERY TIME BECAUSE AGAIN ISE ARE NOT HACKS THESE ARE ASPECTS OF YOUR BREATHING APPARATI INCLUDING THE MECHANICAL STUFF AND THE NURAL STUFF AND THE GAS EXCHANGE STUFF ALL OF WHICH YOU WERE BORN WITH AND THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU AT ANY MOMENTS ALL YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO IS EXPLORE THEM AND DEPLOY THEM AS YOU FEEL NECESSARY IF YOU'RE LEARNING FROM ENDOR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBE T OUR U TUBE CHANNEL THAT'S A TERRIFIC I ZERO COSTWAY TO SUPPORT US IN ADDITION PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO THE PODCAST ON SPOTIFI AND APPLE AND ON BOTH SPOTIFY AND APPLE YOU CAN LEAVE US UP TO A FIVE STAR REVIEW IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR US OR COMMENTS ABOUT THE PODCAST OR GUESTS THAT YOU LIKE ME TO INCLUDE ON THE HUBERMAN LAPODCAST PLEASE PUT THOSE IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOU TUB I DO READ ALL THE COMMENTS PLEASE ALSO CHICK OUT THE SPONSORS MENTION AT THE BEGINNING AND THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S EPISODE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THIS PODCAST NOT SO MUCH ON TO DAY'S EPISODE BUT ON MANY PREVIOUS EPISODE TO TE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST WE DISCUSS SUPPLEMENTS WHILE SUPPLEMENTS AREN'T NECESSARY FOR EVERYBODY MANY PEOPLE DERIVE TREMENOUS BENEFIT FROM THEM FOR THINGS LIKE IMPROVING SLEEP HORMON FUNCTION COGNI FUNCTION AND SO ON THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST IS NOW PARTNER WITH MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS WE'VE DONE THAT FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST OF ALL MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS ARE OF THE VERY HIGHEST QUALITY SECOND OF ALL MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS TEN TO CENTER AROUND SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTS IN YOUR DAILY REGIMEN YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE THE RIGHT SUPPLEMENTS IN THE RIGHT DOSAGES AND YOU WANT TO DO THAT IN THE MOST BIOLOGICALLY AND COSTOFFECTIVE WAY AND SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS ARE THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN DETERMINE WHAT WORKS IN WHAT DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU AND IT'S THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN ADJUST THE DOSAGE OF GIVEN SUPPLEMENTS OR MAY BE VEN ALTER NEIGHT DAYS THAT YOU TAKE ONE AND NOT THE OTHER IN A WAY THAT REALLY ALLOWS YOU TO HOME IN ON WHICH SUPPLEMENTS ARE GOING TO BE IDEAL FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HALTH AND PERFORMANTS ALSO MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENT SHIP INTER NATIONALLY AND THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE WE KNOW A NUMBER OF YOU RESIDE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE SUPPLEMENTS DISCUST ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST YOU CAN GO TO LIVEMOMENTOUS SPELT O U WEST SO LIVEMOMENTOUS DOT COM SLASH HUBERMEN IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY FOLLOWING US ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE ARE HUBERMAN LAB ON INSERGRAM TWITTER FACEBOOK END

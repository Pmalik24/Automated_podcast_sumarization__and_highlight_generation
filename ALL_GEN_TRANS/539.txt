WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONCAS   O SCIENCE SCIENCE TAYE TO OR  I MANDER HUBERMEN AND I MAY PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC ALONG THOSE LINES I WANT A THANK TO DAY'S SPONSORS OF THE PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS AN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOPMICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEU' GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATE AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CAREVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT OT CAM SLASH HUBERMAN TO DAY'S PODCAST EPISODE IS ABOUT SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS JET LAG SHIFT WORK BABYES KIDS AND THE ELDERLY AND WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS PROTOCALLS THAT ARE BACKED BY SCIENCE THAT MEANS QUALITY PURE REVIEWED PAPERS PUBLISHED IN EXCELLENT JOURNALS THAT CAN SUPPORT PARTICULAR TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO COMBAT THINGS LIKE JET LAG OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SHIFT WORK AND MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR THE NEW PARENT AS WELL AS FOR THE NEW BORN CHILD THE ADOLESCENT ANY ONE THAT WANTS TO SLEEP BETTER FEEL BETTER WHEN THEY'RE AWAKE ET CETERA IF YOU'VE LISTEN TO THE PREVIOUS THREE EPISODES OF THE HUBRON LABPODCAST WE'VE BEEN EXPLORING THESE THEMES OF WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEPINESS HOW TO FALL ASLEEP HOW TO STAY ASLEEP AND WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING PERAMETERS LIKE LIGHT EXERCISE TEMPERATURE ET CETERA IF YU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO THOSE EPISODES GREAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL BE EVEN MORE DIGESTIBLE FOR YOU IF YOU HAVEN'T THAT'S O KE I WILL PROVIDE A LO BIT OF BACKGROUND HERE OR THERE SO THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY THAT YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THOSE PREVIOUS EPISODES BUT IF O U GET A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO THM PLEASE DO IT I THINK IT WILL HELP YOU DIGEST THE INFORMATION BETERA LET'S JUST TAKE A STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND REMIND EVERYBODY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND INDOGINESS MEANING WITHIN US RHYTHM THAT WE CALL THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM IS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR RHYTHM IN ALL SORTS OF FUNCTIONS THE MOST PROMINENT ONE IS A RHYTHM IN OUR FEELINGS OF WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEPINESS SO BELIEVE OR NOT THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN DONE THROUGHOUT HISTORY NOT OFTEN BUT IT'S BEEN DONE WHERE PEOPLE WILL GO DOWN INTO A CAVE AND WILL EXIST IN CONSTANT DARKNESS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THER'RE ALSO CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT LIGHT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN CLOSE THEIR EYES IT'S ACTUALLY EASIER TO DO THE EXPERIMENT WHERE YOURE INCONSTANT DARKNESS TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE INDOGINOUS MEANING THE INTERNAL RHYTHM THAT WE ALL HAVE AND IT TURNS OUT WE ALL HAVE THIS RHYTHM OF ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT EXACTLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS MEANING EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE GOES FROM LOW TO HIH AND BACK DOWN TELOW AGAIN AND IT TAKES TWENTY FOUR HOURS FOR THAT TO REPEAT NOT EIGHTEEN NOT SIX TWENTY FOUR PLUSERMINUS A COUPLE HOURS YOU ALSO HAVE A RHYTHM IN SLEEPINESS IND WAKEFULNESS THAT CORRELATES WITH THAT WE TEND TO BE SLEEPY AS OUR TEMPERATURE IS FALLING GETTING LOWER AND WE TEND TO BE MORE AWAKE OR WAKING WHEN OUR TEMPERATURE IS INCREASING THIS IS A BIOLOGICAL FACT IT IS RIGHT DOWN TO OUR DINNA WE HAVE SHAE GENES IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OURSELVES THAT INSURE THAT EVERY CELL IS ON THIS TWENTY FOUR HOUR ISH RHYTHM CLOSE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE HAVE A CLOCK OVER THE ROOF OF OUR MOUTH A GROUP OF NURONS CALLED THE SUPERCAISMATIC NUCLEOUS THAT CLOCK GENERATES AT TWENTY FOR OUR RHYTHM AND THAT CLOCK IS IN TRAINED MEANING IT IS MATCHED TO THE EXTERNAL LIGHT DARK CYCLE WHICH IS NO SURPRISE TWENTY FOUR HOURS SPENDING THE YEARTH TAKES TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO OUR SELLS OUR ORGANS OUR WAKEFULNESS OUR TEMPERATURE BUT ALSO OUR METABOLISM OUR IMUNE SYSTEM OUR MOOD ALL OF THAT IS TETHERED TO THE OUTSIDE LIGHT DARK CYCLE AND IF WE ARE LE LIVING OUR LIFE IN A PERFECT WAY WHERE WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND WE VIEW SUNLIGHT AS IT CROSSES THE HORIZON AND THEND BY EVENING WE CATCH A LITTLE SUNLIGHT AND THEN AT NIGHT WERE IN COMPLETE DARKNESS WE WILL BE MORE OR LESS PERFECTLY MATCH TO THE EXTERNAL OR AMBIENT LIGHT DARK CYCLE VERY FEW OF US DO THAT BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS THAT WE CALL ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS AND THIS OTHER THING THAT WE CALL LIFE DEMANDS SO TO DAY WE'RE IN A TALK ABOUT WHEN WE GET PULLED AWAY FROM THAT RHYTHM NOW YOU MAY IMMEDIATELY BE THINKING WELL I'VE HEARD THERE ARE NIGHT OWLS AND THERE ARE MORNING LARKS THERE SOMETIMES CALLED AND THEIR GYLNETIC PULLING MORPHISMS THAT'S UST TO FANCY NAME FOR GENETIC VARIATIONS THAT MAKE SOME PEOPLE WON O WAKE UP EARLY AND OTHER PEOPLE WONT TO STAY UP LATE AN TEENS WANT TO SLEEP IN MORE SURE THAT'S ALL TRUE THAT'S ALL TRUE REGARDLESS OF WHAT NAMES WE GIVE THOSE HOWEVER THERE'S NO ESCAPING THE FACT THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE A DIURNAL SPECIES WE WERE DESIGNED LITERALLY OUR SELLS AND THE CIRCUITS OF OUR BODY WERE CONSTRUCTED TO BE AWAKE DURING THE DAYTIME AND A SLEEP AT NIGHT HOW DO I KNOW THAT WELL I WASN'T CONSULTED AT THE DESIGN PHASE BUT I'M CERTAIN OF THAT BECAUSE MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN WE DEVIATE TOO FAR FROM A DIURNAL SCHEDULE AND WE TRY AND BECOME NOCTURNAL WE CAN PULL IT OFF BUT SERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STRART TO ARISE I'M NOT GON TO SPEND MUCH OF TO DAY TALKING ABOUT ALL THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF JET LAG ILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT OR THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SHIFT WORK OR TRYNG TO SCARY YOU BY TELLING YOU ABOUT THE QUITE VALIDATA ROUND DEPRESSION EMNESIA DE MENSHA ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING WELL RATHER I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CAN DO AN ARMY WITH TOOLS S LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT PERFECT SCHEDULE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT JET LAG AND WHAT JET LAG REALLY REPRESENTS AND HOW TO PUSH BACK ON JET LAG SHIFT YOUR CLOCK FASTER AND ESCAPE SOME OF THE SEVERE BAD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH JET LAK INCLUDING JUST FEELING MISERABLE WHEN YOUR TRAVELLING FOR WORK OR VACATION SO WHAT IS THE PERFECT DAY WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FROM A CIRCADIAN SLEEP WAKEFULNESS STANDPOINT I'M ABOUT TO SUMMARIZE WHAT I'VE SAID IN THE THREE PREVI OUS PODCAST EPISODES AS WELL AS NOW COUNTLESS IN STERGRAM POSTS HERE'S THE DEAL YOU BASICALLY WANT TO GET AS MUCH LIGHT IDEALLY SUNLIGHT BUT AS MUCH LIGHT INTO YOUR EYES DURING THE PERIOD OF EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE WHEN YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE WHEN YOU WANT TO BE ALERT AND YOU WANT TO GET AS LITTLE LIGHT INTO YOUR EYES AT THE TIMES YOU'V THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE WHEN YOU WANT TO BE ASLEEP WERE DROWSY AND FALLING ASLEEP HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH WELL YOU DON'T WANT TO GO SO HIGH WITH THE LIGHT EXPOSURE THAT YOU DAMAGE YOUR EYES BECAUSE AS MANY OF UHEARD ME SAY BEFORE THE EYES ARE ACTUALLY TO PIECES OF YOUR BRAIN YOUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WERE EXTRUDED OUT OF YOUR SKULL AND AS PIECES OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM A KA YOUR BRAIN THEY WILL NOT REGENERATE LEAST RIGHT NOW THE TECHNOLOGIES DON'T EXIST TO REGENERATE THOSE NURONS AND HUMANS YOU DO NOT WANT TO DAMAGE THEM SO WHAT IS TO BRIGHT WELL WHEN IT'S PAINFUL TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU HAVE TO BLINKER CLOSE YOUR EYES IN ORDER TO BEAR IT SO PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS SO PAINFUL THAT THERE LIKELY GON A DAMAGE YOUR EYES HOWEVER IF YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING AND IT'S STILL DARK OUT AND YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE YOU WOULD BE WIYES TO TURN ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS IN PRARTICULAR OVERHEAD LIGHTS FOR REASONS I'VE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY BUT THOSE OVERHEAD LIGHTS WILL OPTIMALLY TRIGGER THE NURONS THESE MELLNOPS AND CELLS IN THE RETINA THAT WILL ACTIVATE YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT EVEN IF THERE'S CLOUD COVER THE SUN DOES COME OUT EVERY DAY REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE UNLESS YOU LIVE IN A CAVE PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO ME WELL I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE I CAN'T REALLY SEE THE SUN WEN THE SUN IS THERE IT MIGHT BE HOT HIDING BEHIND CLOUDS UNLESS IT'S VERY VERY DARK WHERE YOU LIVE LIKE SKIN AND AVIA IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER WHICH CASE YOU MIGHT WANT SOME ARTIFICIAL LIGHT GET SOME SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES WHEN YOU CAN HERE'S THE DEAL WITH SUNLIGHT AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHT THAT I HAVE NOT DISCUSS PREVIOUSLY A LOT OF PHOTON ENERGY A HIGH AMOUNT OF LUCKS ILL YOU ACTS COMES THROUGH EVEN CLOUD COVER A GOOD NUMBER TO SHOOT FOR AS A RULE OF THUMB IS TO TRY AND GET EXPOSURE TO AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND LUCKS BEFORE NINE A M TEN A M MAYBE BUT BEFORE NINE A M ASSUMING YOU'R WAKING UP SOMETIME BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHT A M SO GET A HUNDRED THOUSAND LUCKS NOW YOU DO NOT I WANT TO REPEAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO STARE AT A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND LUCKS OR A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND LUCK'S LIGHT IT'S VERY VERY BRIGHT THE MECHANISM OF CIRCADEAN CLOCK SETTING AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THE MECHANISM OF CIRCADEAN CLOCK SETTING INVOLVES THESE NURONS IN YOUR EYE THAT SEND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO THIS CLOCK ABOVE THE ROOF OR YOUR MOUTH AND THAT SYSTEM SUMS MEANING IT ADDS PHOTONS IT'S A VERY SLO SYSTEM SO LET'S SAY THAT I WAKE UP AND I LOOK AT MY COMPUTER SCREEN BRIEFLY OR MY PHONE SCREEN THAT'S PRBABLY FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND LUCKS IF I WERE TO LOOK AT THAT FOR A FULL MINUTE I WOULD GET THAT PHOTON ENERGY TRANSFERRED INTO ELECTRICAL ENERGY V NER ONS AND I WOULD BE COMMUNICATED TO MY CIRCADEAN CLOCK HOWEVER THE SIGNAL THAT IT'S MORNING WILL NOT HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK UNLESS I LOOKED AT THAT FOR A HUNDRED MINUTES OR MORE SO HUNDRED THOUSAND NOW THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU WAKE UP AT EIGHT O'CLOCK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ENOUGH LIGHT FROM ARTIFICIAL LIGHT BEFORE YOU REACH WHAT'S CALLED THE CIRCADEAN DEDZONES YOU HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY BEFORE NINE A M MAYBE TEN A M TO CAPTURE ENOUGH PHOTONS AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT WITH YOUR EYES I'VE DISCUSSED WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IN PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THE PLOCK CAST BE HAVE TO DO IT WITH YOUR EYES THERE IS NO EXTROCULAR PHOTO RECEPTION THIS IS NOT ABOUT VIHT EM IN DE IN YOUR SKIN THIS IS ABOUT SETTING YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK WHICH IS PARAMOUNT FROR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH SO HERE WERE TRYING OUT TRYING TO GET THAT AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND PHOTONS BUT NOT ALL AT ONCE BUT YOU GOT TA GET HIM BEFORE NINE A M ISH MAY BE TEN A M SO WHAT YOU DO YOU GO OUTSIDE IF YOU WANT TO GET NURTY ABOUT THIS QUANTITATIVE YOU COULD DOWNLOAD O FREE AP LIKE LIGHT METER AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND YOUR HOUSE WITH LIGHT METER AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT EVEN BRIGHT OVERHEAD LIGHTS ARE ONLY A MITTING ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OR FIVE THOUSAND LUCKS 'S GON TO TAKE A LONG WHILE OF LOOKING AT THOSE LIGHTS WITH EYES OPEN IN ORDER TO SET YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK AND TELL YOUR BRAIN ANBODY THAT'S MORNING GOING OUTSIDE EVEN ON A CLOUDY DAY COULD BE SEVEN THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND LUCKS T'SH REALLY REMARKABLE HOW BRIGHT IT IS MEANING HOW MUCH PHOTON ENERGY IS COMING THROUGH SO TRYING GET A HUNDRED THOUSAND LUCKS BE FOR THAT NINE A M NOW IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN AN AREA OF THE WORLD WHERE IT'S JUST NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH SOME PEOPLE HAVE SENT ME PICTURES FROM NORTHERN ENGLAND I'S JUST NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH IN WINTER THEN SURE YOU CAN RESORT TO USING ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS IN ORDER TO GET ENOUGH PHOTONS AND I'M PUTTING OUT THIS HUNDRED THOUSAND LUCKS NUMBER AS AS A TARGET TO GET EACH DAY BEFORE NINE A M YOU CAN IN THEORY GET IT ALL FROM ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS BUT THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL QUALITIES ABOUT SUNLIGHT THAT MAKE SUNLIGHT THE BETTER STIMULUS FIRST FALL I'S FREE IF IT'S A VAILBLE OUTSIDE THERE IS A A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THERE ARE SCUS ME A NUMBER OF DIFERENT TECHNOLOGIES COMING LIKE THIS ONE LIKE A LIGHT PAD THAT THIS ONE SAYS IT'S A NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY LUCKS I'M NOT INCOVERING THIS EC CAUSE I'M NOT TRYING TO PROMOTE ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCTS ASHLY BOUGHT THIS JUST WITH MY OWN MONEY ON AMAZON ITE'RE NOT A SPONSOR THEN IT LET'S YOU TOGGLE THE BRIGHTNESS I THINK BY HOLDING THIS ON A HOLDING DOWN THIS BUTTON YOU CAN MAKE AT DIMMER BRIGHTER THIS ABOUT A THOUSAND LUCKS IT SEEMS REALLY BRIGHT BUT A CLOUDY DAY OUTSIDE WILL HAVE FIVE TIMES MORE PHOTON ENERGY COMING THROUGH SO SOME PEOPLE SET THESE LIGHTS OR RING LIGHTS THAT THEY USE FOR SELFEES IN THAT KIND OF THING NEAR THEIR COFFEE OR WORK STATION FIR STING IN THE MORNING BUT YOU REALLY WANT TO GET SUNLIGHT O C SO THOSE THINGS ARE COME TON NICE CAUSE THEY'LL TRAVEL AND WERE IN A TALK ABOUT JET LAG BUT I CAN'T EMPASIZE THIS ENOUGH THAT LIGHT HAS TO BE CAPTURED AND SUMED BEFORE YOU ENTER THE CIRCATEAN DEDZONE WHICH IS THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THIS IS AGAIN TRYING TO ACHIEVE CONE PERFECT SCHEDULE THEN I'VE RECOMMENDED BASED ON SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THAT YOU LOOK AT SUNLIGHT SOME TIME AROUND THE TIME WHEN THE SUN IS SETTING AND THE REASON FOR THAT OF COURSE IS BECAUSE IT HAD JUST DOWN THE SENSITIVITY OF YOUR EYES BECAUSE HERE'S THE DIABOLICAL THING WHILE WE NEED A LOT OF PHOTON ENERGY EARLY IN THE DAY TO WAKE UP OUR SYSTEM AND SET OUR CIRCATEAN CLOCK AND REPAR US FOR A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN HOURS LATER IT TAKES VERY LITTLE PHOTON ENERGY TO RESET AND SHIFT OUR CLOCK AFTER EIGHT P M AND THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO AS MUCH AS YOU SAFELY CIN AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT AND EVEN NOT SO BRIGHT LIGHT BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN OR ELEVEN P M AN FOR I M A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND THE LAST EPISODE I WENT INTO RED LIGHTS HO DISCUSS BLUE BLOCKERS ALL THAT KIND OF STUFFSONUCK AN A REPEAT ALL THAT BUT HERE'S THE THING IF YOU SEE AFTERNOONLIGHT YOU ARE GOING TO A JUST DOWN THE SENSITIVITY OF YOUR EYES SO THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE WIGAL ROOM A LOW BET MORE LEE WAY TO VIEW LIGHTS FROM SCREENS AND OVERHEAD LIGHTS EVEN LATE AT NIGHT WITHOUT DESTRUPTING YOUR CIRCATEAN CLOCK BUT IT IS A KIND OF A DOUBLEED SORD WHERE YOU NEED A LOT OF LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND YOU NEED TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHTS LATER IN THE DAY I'VE MENTIONED STUDIES ON HERE A NUMBER OF VIEW OF ASKED ABOUT GETTIN THE REFERENCES WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET A WEDPAGE GOING WITH FULL LENKHS THERE SOME COPY RIGHT ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT WHEREVER POSSIBLE I'LL TRY IN REFERENCE THESE STUDIES AND WHEN PEOPLE ASCO GENERALLY PUT THEM IN THE RESPONSE TO THEIR COMMENTS ON YOU TUBER INSIGRAM THERE HAVE BEEN TWO STUDIES DONE FROM UNIVERSY COLORADO BOTH PUBLISHED IN CURRENT BIOLOGY YOU CAN EASE WE FIND THEUSE ON LINE BY JUST A YOU KNOW LING THE WORDS A CURRENT BIOLOGY CAMPING AND RESET CIRCATEAN CLOCKS THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT TWO DAYS A WAKING UP WITH THE SUN AND AVOIDING LIGHT AT NIGHT THAT SHE TOOK GRADUATESUENS CAMPING THE COOL EXPERIMENTO BE A PART OF RESET THE MELATONAN AND QUARTIS ALL RHYTHMS FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT HAD OTHERWISE DRIFTED QUITE FAR FROM THEIR NATURAL RHYTHMS THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO SHIFT YOUR CLOCK AND TO REINFORCE YOUR CLOCK LIKE EXERCISING MORE O LESS THE SAME TIME EATING MORE LESS THE SAME TIME ET CETERA THAT'S NOT WHAT TO DAY'S EPISODE ISABOUTS I JUST DESCRIBE PERFECT SCHEDULL GET AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND LOOCKS OF LIGHT EXPOSURE TO THE EYES NOT ALL AT ONCE BUT SUMMING ACROSS THE MORNING AGAIN YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S PAINFUL TO LOOK AT SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING TO AVOID BUT THEN ONCE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY LET' SAY YOU'RE WAKING UP AT TEN OR ELEVEN YOU GO OUTSIDE THE SUNS OVERHEAD FORGET YOUR NI CAN SHIFT YOUR CLOCK YOU'RE JUST NOT IT DOESN'T WORK TH WAY IN THE EVENING YOU SEE THET EVENING LIGHT AND YOU WANT TO GET THAT LIGHT TO A JUST DOWN YOUR RETINAL SENSITIVITY TO AFFORD YOU A BIT OF A BUFFER SO THAT LATE AT NIGHT IF YOU HAPPEN TA LOOK AT SCREENS OR GO TO THE BATHROM IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT IT'S NOTKING TO SHIFT YOUR CLOCK BECAUSE IT TAKES PROBABLY ONLY ABOUT A THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED LUCKS OF LIGHT ENERGY A SHIFT YOUR CLOCK IN THE MILL THE NIGHT SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SHIFTING CLOCKS BECAUSE FOR THE JET LAG PERSON THIS ABILITY TO SHIFT THE CLOCK WITH LIGHT TEMPERATURE EXERCISE AND FOOD IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR GETTING ON TO THE NEW LOCAL SCHEDULE AND THERE'S SO MUCH OUT THERE ABOUT JET LAG TO DAY I'M GOINGTO DILET DOWN TO ONE VERY SPECIFIC PERAMETER THAT ALL OF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WITHOUT ANY TECHNOLEDGEY OUR DEVICES AND CAN APPLY FOR WHEN WHEN YOU TRAVEL FOR WORK OR PLEASURE OR ANY TIME YOUR JET LAG AND I WANT TO ABSOLUTELY EMPHASIZE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL TO GET JET LAG MANY OF YOU ARE JET LAG YOU'R JETLAG BECAUSE YOU'RE OKING YOUR FHONE IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT YOUR JET LAG AS YOU'RE WAKING UP AT DIFFERENT TIMES TO DAY YOU'R JET LAG BECAUSE YOUR EXERCISEIS ON A AND CHAOTIC REGIME SOME DAYS AT THIS TIME SOME DAYS AT THAT TIME AND IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU GREAT I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WELL I KNOW SO AND SO THAT YOU KN ONLY NEEDED FOUR HOURS ASLEEP AND AH OR THERRE JUST FINE THEY TRAVEL TO EUROPE AND JUST FIND THERE'S A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY WE'REGING TO TALK ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF SOME OF THAT VERYABILITY MAY I KNOW PEOPLE THAT CAN EAT ANYTHING AND SOMEHOW SEEM TO MAINTAIN GREAT LIPID PROFILES AND OM YOU KNOW A BODY WAIT AND AND FITNESS ABILITY AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THAT THEY EAT ONE CRACKER AND THEY SOR OVE DISSOLVE INTO A PUDDLE OF OF A KIND OF TEARS RIGHT BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THAT SKUN O THROW THEM OFF AND AND MAYBE IT DOES I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VARIABILITY OUT THERE SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT OPTIMAL AND WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND YOU HAVE TO ASK I CAN JUST SAY FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I SUFFER TERRIBLY FROM JET LAG TRAVELING IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS BUT NOT OTHERS SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TROUBLE WITH JET LAG MANY PEOPLE WILL TRAVEL TO NEW LOCATION THEY FEEL GREAT FOR THE FIRST DAY AND NIGHT AND THEN THEY CRASH AND THEY HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING OR THEY TRAVEL BACK AND THEY HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME GETTING BACK ON TO A NORMAL SCHEDULE AND SOME OF THIS VARIES WITH AGE AND SOME OF IT VARIES WITH GENETICS AND THERE IS NO SIMPLE PILL OR ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO JUST GET RID OF JETLAG IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY FIT WORK THAT WAY I WOULD TELL YOU BUT THERE ARE SOME SIMPLE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AN ARM YOU WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT JETLAG IS AND HOW IT WORKS AND CONTRARY TO WHAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE SAY AND BELIEVE I KNOW THAT UNDERSTANDING MECHANISM AFFORDS YOU MORE FLEXIBILITY WH UNDERSTAND MECHANISM AS JUSTSPOSED TO ME JUST WRITING UP A PEDIEF AND GIVING YOU A LIST OF THINGS TO DO WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS IN EXACTLY THE WAY THEY'RE WITTEN DOWN WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND MECHANISM YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO CONTROL THE MACHINE THAT IS YOUR BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO A LITTLEBIT OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT MECHANISM GOES A REALLY LONG WAY SO THAT'S WHEREWEREAHEADED LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT JETLAG IS CAT WELL I PROMISED THAT I WOULDN'T GET TOO DARK WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH JETLAG BUT I'M ABOUT TO GET DARK THERE ARE QUALITY PIREVIEWED PAPERS SHOWING THAT JET LAG WILL SHORTEN YOUR LIFE IT WILL KILL YOU EARLIER I GUSS IT MEANS YOU'LL DIE EARLIER DOESN'T ACTUALLY KILL YOU NECESARILY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE TOURIS AND UP STEPPING IN FRONT OF BUSSES ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE CARS AND BUSSES DRIVE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET THAT THERE USED TO A WHOR JETLAG AND LOSE THEIR LIFE THAT WAY JETLAG IS A SERIOUS THING SHOUL WE HAD A IT A FAMILY STORY ABOUT THIS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND A FAMILY MEMBER TRAVEL OVER SEES FOR WORK AND TAKE A SLEEPING PILL I WON'T NAME THE SLEEPING PILL THOUGH THE ANEMIN A TALK ABOUT SLEEPING PILLS AND HAD A CASE OF TOTALAMNESIA FOR A WEEK AH THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY UNCOMMON IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN REALLY JET LAG AND FALLEN ASLEEP DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WOKEN UP YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND THAT'S BECAUSE TIME AND SPACE IRE REALLY LINKED AND THE BRAIN WASN'T DESIGN TO BE TRANSPORTED FOUR FIVE SIX HOURS INTO A NEW TIMES OWN IT JUST WASN'T OUR BRAIN IN THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT GOVERN CIRCATIAN TIMING WERE DESIGNED TO BE SHIFTED BY A COUPLE HOURS NOT NECESSARILY SIX OR NINE OR TWELVE HOURS SEYOU REALLY MESS YOURSELF UP I'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE I USUALLY EXPERIENCED AS FLUCTUATIONS IN MOOD I FLEW TWELVE HOURS OUT OF PHASE TOBADOBBY ONTS TO GIVE A TALKA AND WHYE YOU ABBDAUBI AND IT WAS A MESS I ACTUALLY AM WAS GETTING VERTIGO AUM I WASN'T HALLUCINATING BUT I WAS REALLY OUT OF IT AND MY MOOD WAS JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE IS VERY BAZAARE JET LAG EVEN IF YOU DON'T EXPERIENCE IT AS MOOD SHIFTS OR AMNESIA IT CAN SHORTEN YOUR LIFE NOW HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING TRAVELING WESTWARD ON THE GLOBE IS ALWAYS EASIER THEN TRAVELING EASTWARD  IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE EFFECTS OF JET LAG ON LONGEVITY HAVE SHOWN THAT TRAVELING EAST TAKES MORE YEARS OFF YOUR LIFE THAN TRAVELING WEST NOW OF COURSE TRAVELING THIRTY MINUTES INTO A NEW TIMES OWN OR THREE HOURS JUST ONE TIMES OWN OVER IS OR TWO TIMES ON OVER RATHER IS FAR LESS AND DETRAMENTAL TO YOUR BIOLOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY THEN A EIGHT HOUR SHIFT OR NINE HOUR SHIFT NOW HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF JET LAG ON LONGEVITY OR THIS IDEA THAT IT CONTRORTEN OUR LIVES WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY WHY IS THAT AND IT TURNS OUT THERE'S A PRETTY SIMPLE EXPLANATION FOR THIS WE'VE TALK BEFORE ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THIS SET OF NURONS IN OUR SPINAL CORD IN BODY AN BRAIN THAT REGULATE OUR WAKEFULNESS IN OUR SLEEPINESS TURNS OUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS AND PROBABLY MOST SPECIES ARE BETTER ABLE TO ACTIVATE AND STAY ALERT THEN THEY ARE TO SHUT DOWN THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND GO TO SLEEP ON DEMAND SO IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO PUSH AND YOU RALLY HAVE TO STAY AWAKE YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN STAY UP LATER BUT FALLING ASLEEP EARLIER IS HARDER AND THAT'S WHY TRAVELING EAST HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH IT THAT BECAUSE YOU'E TRAVELING EAST YOU'RE TRYING TO GO TO BED EARLIER YOU KNOW AS A CALIFORNIAN IF I GO TO NEW YORK CITY I'VE GOT TO GET TO BED THREE HOURS EARLY AND WAKE UP THREE HOURS EARLY MUCH HARDER THAN COMING BACK TO CALIFORNIA AND JUST STAYING UP A FEW MORE HOURS AND THIS PROBABLY HAS ROOTS IN EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION WHERE UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE WE NEED TO SUDDENLY GATHER UP AND GO OR FORGE FOR FOOD OR FIGHT OR UM DO ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE CAN PUSH OURSELVES THROUGH THE RELEASE OF A DRENALIN AN EPON EFRON TO STAY AWAKE WHEREAS BEING ABLE TO SLOW DOWN AND AND DELIBERATELY FALL ASLEEP IS ASHALY MUCH HARDER TO DO SO THERE'S AN A SYMMETRY TO OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT PLAYS OUT IN THE CYMMETERY OF GJETLAG SO IF YOU WANT A READ UP ON THIS BECAUSE PEOPLE OFE ASKED ME ABOUT PAPERS YOU CAN LOOK THERE'S A PAPER PUBLISHED BY DAVIDSON AND COLLEAGUES TWO THOUSAND SIX IN CORNOBIOLOGY THAT TALKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN LIFE SPAN FOR FREQUENT EASTWARD VERSES WESTWARD VERSES NO TRAVEL AND LONCEVITY IN ET CETERA A NUMBER DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF LONCEVITY SO GOING EAST IS HARDER BECAUSE GOING TO SLEEP EARLIER AS HARDER IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT ON DEMAND MANY PEOPLE TO HAVE TURNED TO MELATONAN AS A WAY TO TRYANG AN DUCE SLEEPINESS I'M A TALK ABOUT MELETONAN AT THE END OFV MENTIONED ON PREVIOUS PODCASTS A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE ASKED FOR THE EVIDENCE THAT MELATONAN IS POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO SOME HORMON SYSTEMS MELTON IS A HORMON AND I'LL DISCUSS THAT AT THE END IN PARTICULAR THE ROLL OF MELATONIAN IN SUPPRESSING A HORMON PATHWAY THAN VALVS LUTINIZING HORMONE TESTASTRONA MEN AND ESTERGEN IN FEMALES AS WELL AS A REALLY INTERESTING PEPTYPE CALLED KISSPEPTON AS A COOLNAME ALL RIGHT L LET'S THINK ABOUT TRAVEL AND WHAT HAPPENS LET'S SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING EASTWARD OR WESTWARD BUT YOU'RE GOING NORTH OR SOUTH SO IF YOU GO FROM FOR INSTANCE WASHINGTON D C TO SENTIAGO CHILE OR YOU GO FROM TELL OF EVE ISRAEL TO A CAPE TOWN SOUTH AFRICA YOU'RE JUST GOING NORTH AND SOUTH RIGHT AND NOT YOU EITHER DIRECTION YOU'RE NOT REALLY MOVING INTO A DIFFERENT TIMEZONE YOU'RE NOT SHIFTING SO YOU WILL EXPERIENCE TRAVEL FATIGUE AND TURNS OUT THAT JETLAG HAS TOO ELEM NTS TRAVEL FATIGUE AND TIMES OWN JET LAG TIME'S OWN JET LAG IS SIMPLY THE INABILITY OF LOCAL SUNLIHE AND LOCAL DARKNESS TO MATCH TO YOUR INTERNAL RHYTHM THIS INDODGINOUS RHYTHM THAT YOU HAVE SO BEFORE WE GET TOO COMPLICATED AND TWO DOWN IN THE WEEDS ABOUT THIS I WANTED JUST THROW OUT A COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS FIRST OF ALL I MENTION THIS EARLIER BUT SOME PEOPLE SUFFER FROM JET LAG ALOT OTHER PEOPLE NOT SO MUCH MOST PEOPLE EXPERIENCE WORST JET LAG AS THEY GET OLDER THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT BECAUSE EARLY IN LIFE PATTERNS OF MELATONEAN RELEASE ARE VERY STABLE AND FLAT AND VERY HIGH ACTUALLY IN CHILDREN IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY DON'T UNDERGO PUBERITY THAN IT BECOME CYCLIC DURING PUBRITY MEANING IT COMES ON ONCE EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND TURNS OFF ONCE EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT CYCLES CYCLIC AND THEN AS WE GET OLDER THE CYCLES GET MORE DISERRUPTED AND WE BECOME MORE VULNERABLE TO EVEN SMALL CHANGES IN SCHADUL ET CETERA MEAL TIMES RIGHT SO JETLAG GETS WORSE AS WE AGE IN ADDITION THER OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN WITH AGE THAT PEOPLE START DOING LESS EXERCISE THER DIGESTION CAN GET WORSE ET CETERA SO SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF AGE MIGHT NOT BE DIRECT EFFECTS OF GETTING OLDER BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH BEING OLDER LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO HAVE A REGULAR EXERCISE RACHINE CAN USE THAT EXERCISE RAGIME TO SHIFT THEIR CIRCADEAN CLOCK AND I'VE A GOOD FRIEND OF HIS FATHERS IN HIS EIGHTIES AH HE'S STILL YOU PUSHING OUT YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE THIRTY PUSH UPS A EACH MORNING HE'S ON THE PELATONER WHATEVER IT IS DOING A LOST CYCLINGS O SOME EIGHT YEAR OLDS OR DOING THAT MANY OR NOT AN MANY THIRTY YEAR OLDS ARE NOT BUT IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT'S CAN TO MAKE IT EAGE EASIER TO SHIFT YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK FOR SAKE OF JET LAG AND IT'S ACTUALLY A NOB YOU CAN TURN AND YOU CAN LET LEVERAGE FOR SHIFTING YOUR CLOCK BEFORE GO ANY FURTHER I WANT A MAKE CHANGING YOUR INTERNAL RHYTHM REALLY EASY OR AT LEAST AS EASY AND AS SIMPLE AS ONE COULD POSSIBLY MAK IT I BELIEVE WHEN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR BODY AN BRAIN WHICH IS CALLED YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM A MOST OF YOU KNOW YOUR APPROXIMATE WEIGHT SOME OF YOU MUGT EVEN KNOW YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE SOME YOU MIGHT EVEN KNOW YOUR YOUR A BODY MASS INDECK SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW OTHER THINGS ABOUT YOUR BIOLOGY THAT HAVE FANCY NAMES BUT EVERY ONE SHOULD KNOW THEIR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM DOESN'T REQUIRE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE ALTHOUGH YOU COULD MEASURE IT YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS THE POINT IN EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS CYCLE WHEN YOUR TEMPERATURE IS LOWEST NOW HOW DO YOU MEASURE THAT WITHOUT A THERMOMETER IT TENDS TO FALL NINETY MINUTES TO TWO HOURS BEFORE YOUR AVERAT WAKING TIME SI ON'T REPEAT THAT YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM TENS TO FALL NINETY MINUTES TO TWO HOURS BEFORE YOUR AVERAGE WAKING TIME SO LET SAY YOU'RE NOT TRAVELING AND YOUR TYPICAL WAKE UP TIME IS FIVE THIRTY A M YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS VERY LIKELY THREE THIRTY A M OR FOUR A M IF YOU WANT IF ANY OF YOU WANT TOO YOU CAN MEASURE YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM YOU CAN GET A THERMOMEATER AND YOU CAN MEASURE YOUR TEMPERATURE EVERY COUPLE HOURS FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS ONU CAN FINE YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS THAT YOU HAVE A LOW POINT THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM AND THEN YOUR TEMPRTURE WILL START TO RISE YOU'LL WAKE UP A BOUT TWO HOURS LATER THEN YOUR TEMPERATURE WILL CONTINUE TO RISE INTO THE AFTERNOON IT WILL PEAK MAYBE A LITTLE TROUGH SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS AND THEN IT'LL START DECLINING SLOWLY AS YOUR APPROACHNIGHT TIMETHERE ARE THINGS THAT WILL DISRUPT THAT TEMPERATURE PATTERN SANAS COLD BATHS IN TENS EXERCISE ET CETERA MEALS TEN TOHAVE A THERMOGENIC EFFECT THAT INCREASES TEMPERATURE SLIGHTLY LITTLE BLIPS BUT THE OVERALL CYCLE TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE OF TEMPERATURE HAS THIS PATTERN AND LAST TIME I TALKED ABOUT THE SEMINAL WORK OF COTAKAHASHE AND OTHERS WHO HAVE SHOWN THAT TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY IS THE SIGNAL BY WHICH THIS CLOCK ABOVE THE ROFOR YOUR MOUTH IN TRAINS OR COLLECTIVELY PUSHES ALL THE CELLS AND TISSUES OF OUR BODY TO BE ON THE SAME SCATUEL TEMPERATURE IS THE EFFECTOR AND ONCE YOU HEAR THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE OF COURSE BECAUSE HOW ELSE WOULD YOU GET ALL THESE DIFFERENT DIVER CELL TYPES TO FOLLOW ONE PATTERN RITE A PANKREATIC SELL DOES SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THEN A YOU KNOW A A SPLEEN CELL OR A A NURON RIGH THE'RE ALL DOING DIFFERENT THINGS AT DIFFERENT RATES SO THE TEMPERATURE SIGNAL CAN GO OUT AND THEN EACH ONE OF THOSE CAN INTERPRET THE TEMPERATURE SIGNAL AS ONE UNIFIED AND CONSISTENT THEME OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT SO TEMPERATURES VARY FROM PERSON OF PERSON SOME PEOPLE ARE NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX SOME PEOPLE RUN A L COLDER AT CETERA BUT THE YOU HAVE A LOW POINT YOU HAVE A HIGH POINT NO YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM HOW ARE YOU CON TO FIGURE OUT THIS TEMPERATURE MINIMUM THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM  CAN BE DETERMINED BY TAKING THE LAST THREE TO FIVE WAKE UP TIMES SO LET SAY YOU WAKE UP SEVEN A M AIGHT A M THREE A M MAR'T HAPPENS TAKE THOSE AD THEM TOGETHER AVERAGE THEM BY TAKE ADDING THEM UP AND DIVIDING BY THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT'LL GIVE YOU THE AVERAGE IF YOUARE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WAKES UP AT THREE AM AND THEN GOES BACK TO SLEEP AND SLEEP TILL TEN YOUR WAKE UP TIME WITH TEN A M IF YOU USE AN ALARM CLOCK YOUR WAKE UP TIME IS STILL WHEN YOU GET UP KI I KNOW THALARMCLOCKS HAVE BEEN KIND OF DEMONIZED BUT IN MY WORLD BEING LATE AND MISSING APPOINTMENTS IS ALSO DEMINIZED SO I USE AN ALARM CLOCK MANY PEOPLE  WAKE UP AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME EACH DAY THERE TENDS TO BE SOME VARIATION FOR PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE IT'S GEN A VERY DEPENDING ON LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AVERAGE THAT FOR THREE TO SEVEN DAYS OR SO TAKE THAT WAKE UP TIME YOU CAN THEN GET AN AV RIDGE OR SORT OF TYPICAL TEMPERATURE MINIMUM OK SO NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO GET YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS YOUR ABSOLUTE REFERENCE POINT FOR SHIFTING YOU'R CIRCADIAN CLOCK WHETHER NOT'S FOR JETLAG OR SHIFT WORK OR SOME OTHER PURPOSE HERE'S THE DEAL IF YOU EXPOSE YOUR EYES TO BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE FOUR HOURS MAYBE FIVE OR SIX BUT IN THE FOUR HOURS AFTER YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCK WE'LL SHIFT SO THAT YOU WILL TEND TO GET UP EARLIER AND GO TO SLEEP EARLIER IN THE SUBSEQUENT DAYS  T'S WHAT'S CALLED A PHASE ADVANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO READ UP ON THIS FURTHER YOU ADVANCE YOUR CLOCK OK HOWEVER IF YOU VIEU BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE FOUR TO SIX HOURS BEFOR YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM YU WILL TEND TO PHASE DELAY YOUR CLOCK YOU WILL TEND TO WAKE UP LATER AND GO TO SLEEP LATER COMMINUM REPEAT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH CONFUSION OUT THERE AN PEOPLE TO GOT CIRCADIAN TIME AN ALL THIS FIND YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM I TEND TO WAKE UP AT ABOUT SIX A M SOMETIMES SIX THIRTY SOMETIMES SEVEN IT DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT I WAS DOING THE IGHT BEFORE AS I'M GUESSING IT DOES FOR YOU BUT THAT MEANS THAT MY TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IT'S PROBABLY SOMEWHERE RIGHT AROUND FOR THIRTY A M WHICH MEANS THAT IF I WAKE UP IT AT FOUR THIRTY A M AND I WERE TO VIEW BRIGHT LIGHT AT FOUR THIRTY FIVE A M I'M GOING TO ADVANCE MY CLOCK I'M GOING TO WANT TO GO TO BED EARLIER THE SUBSEQUENT NIGHT AND WAKE UP EARLIER THE SUBSEQUENT MORNING AND AS I SHIFT MY WAKE UP TIME MY TEMPERATURE MINIMUM SHIFTS TOO RIGHT BECAUSE EACH TIME WE SHIFT OUR WAKE UP TIME OUR TEMPRATURE MINIMUM SHIFTS ASSUMING THAT WAKE UP TIME SHIFTS MORE THAN YOU KNOW THIRTY MEN SUR AN HOUR OK IF I WERE TO VIEU BRIGHT LIGHT IN TE FOR TO SIX HOURS BEFORE FOR THIRTY A M GUESS WHAT THE NEXT NIGHT IMINO WANT TO STAY UP LATER AND I'M GIT TO WANT TO WAKE UP LATER THE SUSEQUENT MORNING YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS A REFERENCE POINT NOT A TEMPERATURE READING AGAIN IF YOU WANT A MEASURE YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUMEN FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS NINETY EIGHT POINT WHATEVER NINETY SIX POINT WHATEVER THAT'S FINE YOU CAN DO THAT BUT THAT INFORMATION WON'T HELP YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS WHAT TIME YOUR BODY TEMPRATURE IS LOWEST AND UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE FOUR HOURS OR SO JUST AFTER THAT TIME VIEWING LIGHT WILL ADVANCE YOUR CLOCK TO MAKE YOU WANT TO GET UP EARLIER AND THE FOUR HOURS BEFOR YOUR TEMPERATURE MINMUM VIEWING LIGHT WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO STAY UP LATER NOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE SAYING WHILE I WAKE UP EARLY AND I WANT TO STAY UP LATE IN U'M SLEEPY ALL DAY AN IMUM MESS OR I FEEL FINE LOOK LET'S TALK ABOUT FEELING FINE TURNS OUT THE DEFIN OF DEFINITION OF INSOMNIA IS WHEN YOUR EXPERIENCING EXCESSIVE SLEEPINES S DURING THE DAY SLEEPINESS AND FATIGUE ARE DIFFERENT OKI TOING THE WORLD OF SLEEP MEDICINE FATIGUE IS A PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION SLEEPINESS IS FALLING ASLEEP MY FALLING ASLEEP IS AT YOUR DESK ARE FALLING SLEEP DURING LECTURES OR THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT MY LECTURES THAT MAKES PEOPLE WANT A FALL ASLEEP SO IF THIS CURESURE IN SOMNIA FANTASTIC HOWEVER IN ALL SERIOUSNESS SLEEPINESS DURING THE DAY TIME UNLESS IT'S AROUND YOUR TEMPERATURE PEAK AND ONLY LASKS ABOUT NINETY MINUTES OR SO IS A SIGN OF IN SOMNIA IT'S A SIGN OF LACK OF SLEEP I WANT O BE VERY VERY CLEAR THAT IF YOU KNOW YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM YOU CAN SHIFT YOUR CLOCK USING LIGHT YOU CAN ALSO SHIFT YOUR CLOCK BY ENGAGING IN EXERCISE IN THE FOUR HOURS AFTER YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM TO WAKE UP EARLIER ON SUBSEQUENT NIGHTS OR EXERCISE BEFORE THEN TO DELAY YOUR CLOCK OKI SO NOW YOU CAN START TO SEA AN UNDERSTAND THE THE LOGIC OF THIS SYSTEM AND WILL TALK ABOUT WHY THIS WORK SAND THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT TEMPERATURE IS THE EFFECTOR AND UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE THIS LOW POINT IN THE THAT REFLECTS YOUR MOST SLEEPY POINT ESSENTIALLY RIGHT BEFORE WAKING UP AND THEN TEMPERATURE RISES YOU CAN NOW START TO SHIFT THAT TEMPERATURE ACCORDING TO YOUR TRAVEL NEETS HERE'S ONE WAY IN WHICH YOU MIGHT DO THAT LET SAY I AM GOING TO TRAVEL TO EUROPE WHICH IS NINE HOURS AHEAD TYPICALLY FROM CALIFORNIA I WOULD WANT TO DETERMINE MY TEMPRATURE MINIMUM WHICH FOR ME IS ABOUT FOR THIRTY A M MAY BE FIVE A M AND I WOULD WANT TO START GETTING UP AT ABOUT FIVE THIRTY A M AND GETTING SOME BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE PRESUME ME FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES BECAUSE THE LIGHT THE SUNLIGHT ISN'T TO BE OUT AT THAT TIME MAYBE OVEN EXERCISING AS WELL MAYBEVEN EATING A MEAL AT THAT TIME IF THAT'S IN YOUR PRACTICE YOU WOULD WANT A START DOING THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE TRAVEL BECAUSE ONCE YOU LAND IN WERE I LAND IN EUROPE CHANCES ARE JUST VIEWING THE SUNRISE OR SUNSET IN EUROPE IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW ME TO SHIFT MY CIRCADEAN CLOCK SOME PEOPLE SAY GET SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES WHEN YOU LAND BUT THAT'S NOT IN A WORK BECAUSE ONE OF TWO THINGS IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN WITH A NINE HOUR SHIFT LIKE THAT EITHER I 'M GOING TO VIUSE SUNLIGHT AT A TIME THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE CIRCADEAN DEDZONE THE TIME IN WHICH MY CIRCADEAN CLOCK CAN'T BE SHIFTED OR I'M AN END UP VIEWING SUNLIGHT AT A TIME THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE FORT OF SIX HOUR WINDOW BEFOR MY TEMPERATURE MINIMUM SO IT'S GIN TO SHIFT ME IN EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT I WANT TO GO SO IT CAN BE VERY VERY THALLENGING FOR PEOPLE TO A JUST O JET LAG SO YOU NEED TO ASK IN MY TRAVELING EAST OR ARE MY CHIVLING WEST IF I TRYING TO ADVANCE MY CLOCK OR DELAY MY CLOCK REMEMBER VIEWING LIGHT EXERCISE IN EATING IN THE FORTY SIX HOURS BEFORE YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM WILL DELAY YOUR CLOCK EATING VIEWING SUNLIGHT AND EXERCISING YOU DON'THAVE DO ALL THREE BUT SOME COMBINATION OF THOSE IN THE FORTY SIX HOURS AFTERYOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM WILL ADVANCE YOUR CLOCK AND THIS IS A POWERFUL MECHANISM BY WHICH YOU CAN SHIFT YOUR CLOCK ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE HOURS PER DAY WHICH IS REMARKABLE THAT MEANS YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS GOING A SHIFT OUT AS MUCH AS THREE HOURS WHICH CAN MAKE IT SUCH THAT YOU CAN TRAVEL ALL THE WAY TO EUROPE AND IN AS LONG AS YOU'VE PREPARED FOR A DAY OR SO BY DOING WHAT I DESCRIBED BACK HOME AND THEN DOING IT WHEN YOU ARRIVE YOU CAN POTENTIALLY O ACCOMPLISH THE ENTIRE SHIFT WITHIN ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT EMPHASIZE THAT ONCE YOU ARRIVE IN YOUR NEW LOCATION AND HERE I'M TOLING ABOUT TRAVELLING EASTWARD CALIFORNIA TO EUROPE ONCE YOU ARRIVE IN YOUR NEW LOCATION YOU HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM WAS BACK HOME AND HOW IT'S BEING SHIFTED DURING YOUR TRIP NOW IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO THAN YOU THINK ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SMART PHONE IS THAT YOU CAN'T DO A YOU KNOW SOMETHING GOOFY LIKE WEARING TWO WATCHES ONE WATCH THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE TIME BACK HOME AN ANOTHER ONE THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE LOCAL TIME TIBICALLY IT UP DATES AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON WHYFI ET CETERA BUT IF YOU CAN KEEP TRACK OF THE TIME BACK HOME THEND YOU CAN EASILY SHIFT YOUR CLOCK GOING FORWARD I'M HOPING THIS TO MAKE SENSE I REALLY ONT EMPHASISE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PRECISE DOWN TO THE MINUTE SOME OF YOU MAY BE ASKING WHAL WHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THIS TEMPERATURE MINIMUMENT IF I'VE YOU LIGHT ONE MINUTE BEFORE IT THEN I'M GOING TO DELAY MY CLOCK AND ONE MINUTE AFTER IT I'M GIN TO ADVANCE MY CLOCK IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK LIKE THAT OKI BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT LIGHT IS THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH WE CAN SHIFT OUR CLOCK AND NOW YOU SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE THE CIRCADIAN DEDZONE FROM ABOUT NINE THIRTY TEN A M ALL THE WAY UNTIL SIX HOURS BEFORE YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM YOUR NOT CAN SHIFT YOUR CLOCK NOTHING THAT YOU DO IN THAT TIME IN TERMS OF LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOUR FEEDING ET CETERA IS GAN A SHIFT YOUR CLOCK AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LANDING IN EUROPE GETTING SUNLIGHT IN THEIR EYES AND THROWING THEIR CLOCK OUT A WACK OR NOT SHIFTING THEIR CLOCK AT ALL THIS BRINGS ME TO THE OTHER THING THAT'S HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND I'VE MENTION THIS BEFORE BUT YOU WANT TO EAT ON THE LOCAL MEAL SCADULE IF IT'S IN YOUR PRACTICE TO FAST FAST THAT'S FINE BUT WHEN YOU EAT YOU WANT TO EAT WITHIN THE LOCAL SCHEDULE FOR ALERTNESS OK THAT MEANS IF YOU ARRIVE IN EVERY ONE'S EATING BREAKFAST AND YOU CAN'T STOMACH THE IDEA OF BREAKFAST YOUR NEW LOCATION CAUSEYOUR APPETITE IS AN THERE THAT MEANS THE CLOCK IN YOUR LIVER YOU HAVE A CLOCK IN YOUR LIVER BIOLOGICAL CLOCK HAS NOT CAUGHT UP TO THE NEW TIMESONE YOU CAN FOR RST YOURSELF TO EAT IF YOU LIKE OR YOU CAN SKIP THAT MEAL BUT WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS STAY ON YOUR HOME MEAL SCHEDULE WAKING UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT AND EATING THAT IS REALLY GON TO THROW THINGS OFF BECAUSE A LOT OF THE CLOCKS IN THE PERIPHERY LIKE FROM THE THE LIVER THE PERFERAL BODY WE'LL SEND INFORMATION BACK TO THE BRAIN THEN THE BRAIN IS GETTING REALLY CONFLICTED SIGNALS SO THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS REALLY YOUR ANCHOR POINT FOR SHIFTING YOUR CLOCK BEST I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS INFORMATION REALLY HASN'T MADE IT INTO AM THE POPULAR SPHERE QUITE SO MUCH THERE'S ALL SORTS OF STUFF ABOUT TAKING THINGS LIKE MELATONIAN A USING BY NORAL BET'S A LOTIC AN  LIKE A A MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPLICATED AND POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC A WAYS OF TRYNA SHIFT THE CLOCK LET'S TALK ABOUT MELATONIAN BUT FIRST I JUST WANT A PAWS AND SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I TALKED ABOUT TRAVELLING EASTWARD BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT TRAVELLING WESTWARD SO I WANT TO DO THAT NOW LET'S SAY YOUR TRAVELING FROM NEW YORK TO CALIFORNIA OR FROM EUROPE TO CALIFORNIA THE CHALLENGE THERE TENDS TO BE HOW CAN YOU STAY UP LATE ENOUGH NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ASYMMETRICALLY WIRED SUCH THAT IT'S EASIER TO STAY UP LATE LATER THAN WE WOULD NATURALLY WANT TO THEN IT IS TO GO TO SLEEP EARLIER SO LET'S SAT YOU LAND AND IT'S FOUR P M AND YOU'R JUST DYING YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA YOU CANME FROM EUROPE IT'S FOUR P M AN YOUR YOU REALLY REALLY WANT TO GO TO SLEEP THAT'S WHERE THE USE OF THINGS LIKE KAFFINE EXERCISE AND SUNLIGHT CAN SHIFT YOU RIGHT IF IT'S AFTER YOUR TEMPERATURE PEAK THEN VIEWING SUNLIGHT AROUND SIX P M OR EIGHT P M OR A ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IF THERE IS IN SUNLIGHT WE'LL HELP SHIFT YOU LATER RIHT IT'S COMBE IT'S GOIN A DELAY YOUR CLOCK AND YOU CAN BE ABLE TO STAY UP LATER THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS TAKE AN AP THAT WAS INTENDED TO LAST TWENTY MINUTES OR AN HOUR I DO THIS ROUTINELY AND THEN WAKE UP FOUR HOURS LATER OR YOU WAKE UP AT YE AND IT'S MIDNIGHT AND YOU CAN'T FALL BACK ASLEEP YOU REALLY WANT TO AVOID DOING THAT SO PROVIDED IT'S NOT EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS STIMULANTS LIKE KAFFINE IN COFFEYOUR TEA CAN REALLY HELP YOU PUSH PAST THAT AFTERNOON BARRIER AND GET YOU TO SLEEP MORE LIKE ON THE LOCAL SCHEDULE AND EATING ON THE LOCAL SCHDULE AS WELL A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF AST ABOUT THE USE OF MELATONIN TO INDUCE SLEEPINESS ARE IT WELL IT'S THINK ABOUT WHAT MELATONIAN IS MELATONA IS THIS HORMONE THAT'S RELEASE FROM THE PINEO GLAND WHICH IS A GLAND A  COUPLE NOTES ABOUT THE PINEL CAUS I BEENGETTING A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS A PRAGNAT DRAWSOM FIRE FOR THIS BUT A I'D I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE A AA THOUGHTFUL CONSIDER IT DEBATE A WITH SOME PEREVIEWED PAPERS IN FRONT OF US THE PINEL DOES MAKE THIS HALLUSENGENIC MOLOCULE THEY CALL D M T BUT IN SUCH MINISCULE AMOUNTS THAT IT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HALLUCINATIONS YOU SEE AN SLEEP IN DREAMING SORRY FOLKS IT'S ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HALLUCINATIONS YOU MIGHT SEE THROUGH OTHER APPROACHES TO DE EMPTY IT'S JUST NOT THAT'S NOT WHERE THE DEEMTE COMES FROM IT'S INFANTESTIMALLY SMALL AMOUNTS THERE ARE A LOT OF CON A WACKY CLAIMS OUT THERE ABOUT CALCIFICATION OF THE PINEAL AND FLORIDE AND THIS KIND OF THING BOOK THE PINEL SITS IN AN AREA OF THE BRAIN NEAR THE FOURTH VENTRICAL WHERE THE SKULL IS NOT TERRIBLY FAR AWAY ALTHOUGH THERE SOME OVERLATING NERAL TISSUE AND WITH AGE THERE'S SOME AGGREGATION OF SOME OF THE A MENINGIS AND OTHER THINGS AROUND THERE THAT THAT STICK TO THE SKULL YOUNG BRAINS DON'T LOOK LIKE OLD BRAINS BUT THERE'S NO CALCIFICATION OF THE PINEAL ALL RIGHT SO YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT CALCIFICATION THE PINEALS ARE PROBLEM I DO'T KNOW WHERE THAT WHOLE THING GOT STARTED BUT OM THAT'S NONE ISSUE YOUR PINELE WILL CHURN OUT MELATONAN  WHOLE LIFE MELATONAN INDUCES SLEEPINESS MELATONIAN DURING DEVELOPMENT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR TIMING THE SECRETION OF CERTAIN HORMONS THAT ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR PUBERITY DOES MELATONA CONTROLL THE ON SET OF PUBERITY NOT DIRECTLY BUT INDIRECTLY MELATONAN INHIBIT SOMETHING CALLED GANATITROPAN RELEASING HORMON WHICH IS A HORMON THAT'S RELEASED FROM YOUR HYPOTHALMUS ALSO ROUGHLY ABOVE THE RUFRYOUR MOUTH IN YOUR BRAIN CAN NATUROBEEN RELEASING HORMONAS REALLY INTERESTING CAUSE IT STIMULA STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF ANOTHER HORMON CALLED LUTINIZING HORMON WHICH IN FEMALES CAUSES A ESTROGEN TO BE RELEASED WITHIN THE OVERIES SINVOLVED IN REPRODUCTIVE CYCLES AND IN MALES STIMULATES TESTOSTERON FROM THE CERTOLY CELLS OF OF THE OF THE TESTIES MELATONIAN IS INHIBITORY TO GAN AR H GANATRO  RELEASING HORMON AND THEREFORE IS INHIBITORY TO ELH LUTINIZING HORMON AND THEREFORE IS INHIBITORY TO TESTASTRON AN ESTRGAN JUST NO TUWAYS ABOUT IT THERE IS IT MENS AMOUNT OF DATA ON THE FACT THAT HIGH LEVELS OF MELATONAN IN SEASONLY BREATHING ANIMAL BREEDING ANIMALS TAKES THE OVERIES FROM NICE AND ROBUST OVERIES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF DEPLOYING EGGS AND THIS KIND OF THING AND LITERALLY SHRINKING THEM AND MAKING THESE ANIMALS IN FERTILE THESE ARE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF MELTONAN IN SEASONAL BREEDERS IN WINTER MELATONAN IN MALES OF SEASONAL BREATHERS TAKES THE TESTIS AND SHRINKS THEM LONG AGO WHEN I WAS AT OU SEE BERKLEY IS A MASTER STUDENT WAS WORKING ON NERONECRONOLOGY AND WE'RE WORKIN ON OM THIS HAMPSTER SPECIES OF SEASONAL BREEDERS AND BASICALLY WHEN DAYS ARE LONG WHICH INHIBITS MELATONAN THESE LITTLE A SIBERIAN HAMPSTERS AS ARE CALLED HAVE TESTES ABOUT THE SIZE OF OR F TYPICAL TABLE GRAPES ALTHOUGH THAT'S A WEIRD WAY TO PUT IT WHEN DAYS GET SHORTER AND THE MELATONAN SIGNAL GETS LONGER BECAUSE LIGHT IN HIBITS MELATONAN DAYS GET SHORTER MELTONE GETS LONGER THOSE SAME HAMPSTERS WOULD HAVE TESTIES THAT WOULD INVOLUTE TO THE SIZE OF ABOUT OF GRAIN OF RICE NOW THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN HUMANS IN SHORT DAYS BUT NONE THE LESS THE MELATONAN SIGNAL REALLY DOES HAVE A TON OF EFFECTS ON THE HORMO SYSTEM NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF YU'VE BEEN TAKING MELATONAND YOU'VE REALLY SCREWED UP YOUR HORMONTS NOT NECESSARILY DOES IT MEAN IF A KID HAS BEEN TAKING MELATONAN THAT'S REALLY SCREWING UP THEIR PUBERITY NOT NECESSARILY INHERES WHY MELATONAN OPERATES ON A CONCENTRATION LEVEL SO IN A CHILD THAT'S VERY VERY SMALL THAT HAS HIGH LEVELS OF MELATONAN IT ACTHLCAN INHIBIT G AN R H L H TESTOSTERNER ASTROGEN DEPENDING ON IT THE SEXS OF THE CHILD BUT AS THAT CHILD GROWS THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS LIKE GROTHOMON RELEASE ET CETERA THAT SAME AMOUNT AMELATONAN RELEASED FROM THE PINEAL IS NOW DILUTED OVER A MUCH LARGER BODY SO THE CONCENTRATION ACTUALLY GOES WAYWAY DOWN  BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM WAS SUPPLEMENTING MELATONAN AS I MENTION THE PREVIOUS EPISODE CONCENTRATIONS OF MELATONAN IN MANY COMMERCIAL SUPPLEMENTS HAVE BEEN SHON TO BE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT TO FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT OF WHAT'S LISTED ON THE BOTTLE SO WHEN YOU TAKE MELATONAN OR A CHILD TAKES MLATONAN OFTENTIMES THEY ARE TAKING SUPER PHYSIOLOGICAL LEVELS OF MELATONAN WHICH AT LEAST BY MY READ AND THE LITERATURE SAYS THAT IT COULD HAVE DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON TIMING AND COURSE OF THINGS LIKE PUBERTY SO IT'S NOTT SO MUCH THAT THE JOURNALS HAVE COME OUT SAYING O TAKING A THAT MELATONAN INHIBITS PUBERITY ITS THAT NO SINGLE STUDY HAS BEEN DONE WITH THE SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL LEVELS OF MELATONAN THAT ARE PRESENT IN A LOT OF THESE SUPPLEMENTS IN DEVELOPING CHILDREN SO MELATONAN IS USED WIDELY FOR INDUCING SLEEPINESS WHEN YOU WANT A FALL SLEEP IN THE NEW LOCATION THAT YOU'VE ARRIVED IN YOU CAN'T FALL SLEEP YOU TAKE MELTONIAN HELPS YOU FALL SLEEP IT DOES NOT HELP YOU STAY A SLEEP IN ADDITION TO THAT MELATONAN HAS BEEN KIND OF TOUDED AS THE BEST WAY TO SHIFT YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK I'M HAPPY TO GO ON RECORD SAYING IT LOOK IF YOU NEED MELATONAN YOU CAN WORK WITH A DOCTOR OR SOEBODY WHO REALLY UNDERSTAND CIRCADEAN AND SLEEP BIOLOGY GO FOR IT IF THAT'S YOUR THING BUT I AS ALWAYS ON THIS PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE I I HAVE ABIAS TOWARD BEHAVIORAL THINGS THAT YOU CAN TITRATE IND CONTROL LIKE EXPOSURE TO LIKE EXERCISE TEMPERATURE ET CETERA THAT HAVE MUCH BIGGER MARGINS FOR SAFETY ANDN CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THESE OTHER ENDICRAN EFFECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AND TALKING ABOUT SO IF YOU ONT TAKE MLATONIN THE AFTERNOON IN ORDER TO FALL ASLEEP OR IN THE EVENING BE MY GUESTS THAT'S UP TO YOU AGAIN YOUR RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTH NOT MEE BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE MELATONAN IS NOT GOING TO BE THE BEST SOLUTION THE BEST SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE TO USE LIGHT AN TEMPERATURE AND EXERCISE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM TO SHIFT YOUR CLOCK BOTH BEFORE YOUR TRIP AND WHEN YOU LAND IN YOUR YOU LOCATION IN YOU CLOCK STARTS TO SHIFT O CASEO NOW YOU KNOW MY OPINIONS ABOUT MELATONAN FEEL FREE TO FILT ERTHM THROUGH YOUR OWN OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES WITH MELETONAN AND NOW YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS AND HOW IT REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT LANDMARK EITHER SIDE OF WHICH YOU CAN USE LIGHT TEMPERATURE AND EXERCISE TO SHIFT YOUR CLOCK JUST REMIND YOULOBIT ABOUT TEMPERATURE IF YOU WAN A SHIFT YOUR CLOCK TYPICALLY YOU WOULD DO THAT BY YOU TAKE A HOT SHOWER AND THEN THAT WILL HAVE A COOLING EFFECT AFTER THE OT SHOWER AND IF YOU WERE TO GET INTO A COLD SHOWER OR AN ICE BATH IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ONE AFTERWARD YOU THERE'S GOING TO BE A THERMAGENIC EFFECT OF YOUR BODY INCREASING TEMPERATURE AND IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT YOUR NATURAL RHYTHM BACK HOME WHEN EVERYTHING STABLE YOU HAVE UT I NAY DEER A LOW POINT IN WHICH IS YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM AND THEN YOU HAVE A PEAK AND YOUD THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS HOT OR COLD SHOWER IN THAT RHYTHM NOW YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE SHIFTING YOUR HYTHM THAT TEMPERATURE RHYTHM IS THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO MOVE GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IF I WERE TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND LESS IE I WAKE UP SIX SIX A M MY TEMPERATURE I KNOW IS RISING I'VE PASSED MY TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IF I WERE TO GET INTO A HOT SHOWER THAT WOULD THEN LOWER MY BODY TEMPERTURE WHEN I GOT OUT THAT IS NOT NORMALLY WITH HAPPENING FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND THEREFORE MY CLOCK WOULD VERY LIKELY GET FAZE DELAGHT I IT'S GIN TO DELAY THE INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE WHEREER AS IF I GOT NTO A COLD SHOWER SOMETHING I DON'T PERSONALY LIKE TO DO BUT I'VE DONE FROM TIME TO TIME ER AN ICE BATH THAT'S GOING TO THEN HAVE A REBOUND INCREASE IN BODY TEMPERATURE AND IS GOING TO PHASE ADVANCE MY CLOCK THAT PEAK IN THE AFTERNOON IS GOING TO COME ABOUT AN HOUR EARLIER IMEN'T WANT TO GO TO BED EARLIER LATER THAT NIGHT SEEU CAN START TO PLAY THESE GAMES WITH TIMING AND HOT AND COLD WITH MEALS WHETHER NOT YOU EAT OR YOU DON'T EAT AND WITH LIGHT EXPOSURE WHETHER NOT YOU VIEOU LIGHT OR YOU DON'T VIEU LIGHT O NOW YOU CAN START TO SEE WHY UNDERSTANDING THE COR MECHANICS OF A SYSTEM CAN REALLY GIVE YOU THE MOST FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE I COULD SPEND THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE ANSWERING EVERY QUESTION ABOUT EVERY NUANT'S PATTERN OF TRAVEL WELL WE'RE GOING TO SYDNEY THEN WE'RE GOING THERE WHAT SHOULD I DO BUT THAT'S ON YOU YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM AND YOUR TEMPERATURE PEAK IF YOU LIKE AND THEN YUSE THESE PIRAMETERS TO IT GIVES YOU FLEXIBILITY AND THAT REALLY UNDERSCORES THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND MECHANISM IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING NAURADICALLY ATTACHED TO A SPECIFIC PROTOCAL IT'S THE OPPOSITE IT GIVES YOU POWER TO NOT BE NAURODICALY ATTACHED TO A SPECIFIC PROTOCAL IT CAN YOUYOU GREAT CONFIDENCE AND FLEXIBILITY IN BEING ABLE TO SHIFT YOUR BODY RYTHMS HOWEVER YOU WANT WHEN THINGS GET OU UACK YOUN TUCK THEM RIGHT BACK INTO PLACE ONE THING THAT'S A COMMON IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO DO A QUICK TRIP IT'S NOT ALWAYS AT YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO YOU KNOW ON VACATION FOR TWO WEEKS OR YOU'NL WORKS OME PLACE ELSE FOR WEEKS ON END IF YOUR TRIP IS FORTY EIGHT HOWERS OR LESS STAY ON YOUR HOME SCHEDULE THIS CAN BE TOUGH AND IT MAY REQUIRE SCET HILLING MEETINGS ACCORDING TO YOUR HOME SCHEDULE BUT IF YOU CAN SOMEHOW MANAGE THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO STAY ON YOUR HOMESCHEDULE YOUR CLOCK IS NOT GOING TO SHIFT MORE THAN A COUPLE HOURS EVEN IF YOU DO EVERYTHING CORRECTLY IN ONE DAY OKHASO IF I WERE TO TRAVEL SAY TO EUROPE I'VE ACTUALY DONE THIS I DID A TWENTY FOUR HOUR TRIP TO BOZZLE SWITZIL AND GAVE A TALK AND CAME BACK PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY BUT IALO BIT OF TRAVEL FATIGUE CAUSE REMEMBER THERE'S FATIGUE FROM THE ACTUAL TRAVEL EXPERIENCE THE NOVELTY OF IT THE ERNS NEVER GREAT ON THE PLAINS THIS WAS EVEN TRUE BEFORE THERE WERE MASK REQUIREMENTS ANDTHINGS LIKE THAT THERE'S THE TRAVEL FATIGUE BUT YOU DON'T THROW YOUR CLOCK OFF IF YOU  STAY FORTY EIGHT HOURS THEND YOU START TO SHIFT A LITTLE BIT SEVENTY TOO THAT'S WHEN YOU TART RUNNING INTO TROUBLE THE TRANSIT TIME IS ALL SO IMPORTANT BUT I WOULD SAY IF IT'S THREE DAYS OR LESS STAY ON YOUR HOME SCHEDULE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND BECAUSE SUNLIGHT ISN'T UNDER YOUR CONTROL MUSTER SOMETHING ABOUT YOU IU DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHEN  TRAVELING WITH SOME SORT OF BRIGHT LIGHT LIKE THE LIGHT PAD THAT I HAVE DOWN THERE THAT I SHOWED EARLIER OM FOR THOSE YOURE LISTEN JUST ON AUDIO IT'S JUST IT  THAT LOOKS LIKE A EIGHT AND A HALF BY LEVENCH U PAD IT'S ACTUALLY NOT DESIGN FOR WAKE UP IT'S I SHALLY DESIGN IT'S A DRAWING PAD AND YOU CAN UM AND IT ADMITS ABOUT A THOUSAND LOOCKS OF OF LIGKE AND  SO IF YOU WON A TRAVEL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN USE THAT IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM TO WAKE UP WHEN YOU LIKE UM  SOME PEOPLE WILL USE A NIGHT SHADES YOU KNOW THE UM NOT THE NIGHT SHADES THAT YOU EAT OR THAT'S SOME PEOPLE SAY YORE NOT'S PLICLY DOWN KNWNHING ABOUT THAT BUT THE A THE THE I COVERS THAT UT TO KEEP LIGHT OUT THOSE THAT THOSE CAN BE VERY USEFUL ON PLAINS AND IN HOTELS AND SO ON SO YOU CAN USE LIGHT AN DARK AND YOU CAN TRAVEL WITH YOUR LIGHT AND T DARK DEVICES UM SO THAT YOU CAN STAY ON YOUR HOME SCHEDULE AND GET MOST OF YOUR LIGHT WHEN IT WOULD BE YOUR NORMAL WAKE UP TIME BACK HOME AND WHAT'S KIND NICE AS IF YOU KNOW ON YOUR CIRCADIAN DEDZONE IS BACK HOM WHICH IS GENERALLY FOR MOST PEOPLE ROUND TEN A M TO ABOUT THREE P M SO BASELY THE RISING PHASE OF YOUR TEMPERATURE THEND YOU CAN ALSO FEEL FREE TO BE OUTSIDE WITHOUT HAVING WORE SON GLASSES OR YOU NOGT TO WORRY ABOUT LIGHT EXPOSURE BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT WINDOW BEFORE YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM THAT FORTO SIX HOUR WINDOW THAT'S THE TIME WHEN IF YOU'RE VIEWING A LOT OF LIGHT IN YOUR NEW LOCATION YOU ARE GOING TO SHIFT YOUR CLOCK PRETTY CON SIDERABLY AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK HOME AND HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME AT THE END OF GRADUATE SCHOOL I WENT TO AUSTRALIA THE REMARKABLE COUNTRY INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN CREDIBLE WILD LIFE AN AMAZING TIME I CAME BACK AND WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE I COULDN'T SLEEP ON A REGULAR SCHEDUL O SLEEPING IN LIKE HOUR LONG INCREMENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT WAS A NIGHTMARE AND IT TOOK ME WEEKS TO GET BACK ON TARGET AND THE WAY I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT WAS EXERCISING CONSISTENTLY AT THE SAME TIM M EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS TURNING MY HOME IN TO ESCENTALY A CAVE AT NIGHT EVEN COVERING UP THE WINDOWS AND THEN GETTING AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT IN MY EYES AS I POSSIBLY COULD DURING THE DAY NO SUNGLASSES ET CETERA SO CAN TAKE SOME REAL WORK IF YOU IF YOUR CLOCK GETS THROWN OUT A WACK THERE'S A PHENOMENON CALLED I SEE YOU CYCHOSIS WHERE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE INTENTS OF CARRYUNIT IN HOSPITALS ASHY LOSE THEIR MIND THEY THEY BECOME PSYCOTIC UM HALLUCINATIONS AT CETERA AND IT'S BECAUSE OF ALTER CIRCADIAN CYCLES WE KNOW THIS CAUSE THERE EXPOSE TO THESE LIGHTS IN THESE SOUNDS PEOPLE COMING IN AND CHECKING ON THEM THEY LEAVE THE HOSPITAL OR IN SOME CASES THERE BEEN EXPERIMENTSWHERE PEOPLE ARE PLACE NEAR A WINDOW WHERE TEY GET SOME NATURAL LIGHT AND THE PSYCOTIC SYMPTOMS DISAPPEAR PRESUMI THEIR WEREN'T PSYCOTIC SYMPTOMS BEFOREHAND BEFORE THEY ENTER THE HOSPITAL SO IT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC WHAT LIGHT CAN DO A TO THE PSYCHE IN TO THE BODY SO LET'S TALK A LITW BIT ABOUT A DIFFERENT FORM OF JET LAG THAT REQUIRES NO PLAINS NO TRAINS NO AUTOMOBILES AND THAT'S SHIFT WORK SHIFT WORK IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON MANY OF US ARE SHIFT WORKING EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE TO WERE DOING WORK IN THE MILL THE NIGHT WE ARE OM YOU KNOW WORK IN ORE COMPUTERS AT ODD HOURS SLEEPING DURING THE DAY LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER OM SHELTERIN PLACE TYPE STUFF UM ARE DOING MORE OF THIS KIDS WITH THE DRIFTING SCHOOL SCHADULES HERE'S A DEAL WITH SHIFT WORK IF THERE'S ONE RULE OF THUMB FOR SHIFT WORK IT'S THAT IF AT ALL POSSIBLE YOU WANT TO STAY ON THE SAME SCHADULE FOR AT LEAST FOURTEEN DAYS INCLUDING WEAK ENDS NOW THAT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CUE THE NON SHIFT WORKERS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT GETTING TOO FAR OFF TRACK ON THE WEEK AND EVEN IF YOUR NOT A SHIFT WORKER SO SLEEPING IN ON SUNDAY IS NOT A GOOD IDEA THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT SHIFT WORK IS TO STAY CONSISTENT WITH YOUR SCHADUAL I HAD A CONVERSATION ON INSGRIM LIVE WITH SIMMER HATAR WHOS A NERO SCIENTISTS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF MENTAL HEALTHIES ISHURE THE HEAD OF THE CHRONOBIOLOGY UNIT THERE AND HE WAS REALLY EMPHASIZING THIS POINT BECAUSE SHIFT WORK WORK PEOPLE ARE DOING THE SO CALLED SWING SHIFT WHERE THERE WORKING FOUR DAYS ON ONE SHIFT IN FOUR DAYS ON OR ANOTHER IS EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL TO A NUMBER OF HEALTH PERAMETERS IT GETS THE CORTIS ALL RELEASE FROM THE ADRENALS REALLY AT A WACK AND THERE THESE CORTIS ALL SPIKES IT VARIOUS HOURS OF THE DAY IT MESSES UP LEARNING IT REALLY DESTRUPTS THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM AND WELL BEING IT IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS PROBLEM SO IF YOU CAN NEGOTIATE WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO STAY ON THE SAME SHIFT FOR TWO WEEKS AT A TIME THAT'S GOING TO BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL WILL HELP YOU OFFSETT A LOT OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SHIFT WORK W I DON'T PRESUME THAT ALL OF YOU ARE GOIN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SOME OF YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF CONTROL AND OF COURSE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHIFT WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL IT A OF COURSE FORSE RESPONDERS FIREFIRERS POLECE OFFICERS PARAMETIC ET CETERA BUT ALSO PILOTS PEOPLE INURT NIGHT NURSES PEOPLE UM WORKING ON HT ON THE HOSPITAL WARDS PEOPLE PICKING UP TRASH THIS TES NIGHT SHIFTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR FUNCTIONING IS A SOCIETY IS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU CAN APPRECIATE IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK A SHIFT WERE LET'S SAY YOU START AT FOUR P M AND YOU END AT TWO P TWO A M XCUSE ME THEN THERE SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT ARISE FOR INSTANCE SHOULD YOU SEE LIGHT DURING YOUR SHIFT WELL THIS IS A MATTER OF PERSONAL CHOICE BUT I DEALLY YOU WANT OF VIOU AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND IS IS SAFELY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU NEED TO BE ALERT SO THAT WOULD MEAN FROM FOR P M TO TWO A M AND THEN YOU WOULD WANT TO SLEEP SO YUSING LIGHT AS A CORLET OF ALERTNESS AND USING DARKNESS AS A CORLET OF SLEEPINESS WHAT THIS MEANS IS SEE AS MUCH LIGHT AS YOU SAFELY CAN DURING THE PHASE OF YOUR DAY WHEN YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE IT'S THE SAME THINT I SAID WAYBACK THE BEGINNING OF THE OF THIS PODCASTS EPISODE AND SEE AS LITTLE LIGHT AS SAFELY POSSIBLE AND TA LOWS YOU TO FUNCTION DURING THE TIME WHEN YOU WANT TO BE ASLEEP SO YOU'RE FINISHING OUT THAT TWO  M SHIFT THAT'S WHEN YOU WOULD WANT TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE YOU'D WANT TO GO HOME YOU'D REALLY WANT TO AVOID WATCHING TEEVY IF POSSIBLE IF YOU NEED THAT IN ORDER TO FALL ASLEEP THAT WOULD BE A CASE WHERE SOMETHING LIKE DIMMING THE SCREEN PLUS BLUE BLOCKERS IF THAT'S IN YOUR PRACTICE UM OR YOU WANT TO DO THAT WOULD WOULD BE HELPFUL AND THEN GOING TO SLEEP AND THEN YOU'LL PROBABLY WAKE UP LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OR OR EARLY AFTERNOON SOMEBON YOU MIGHT SAY WATE HUBERMEN I THOUGT YOU DON'T LIKE BLUE BLOCKERS I NEVER SAID I DON'T LIKE BLUE BLOCKERS I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WEARING BLUE BLOCKERS AT THE TIME A DAY WHEN THEY WANT TO BE ALERT AND I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE ASSERTING THAT BLUE BLOCKERS CAN PREVENT CIRCADEAN SHIFTS SIMPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WEARING THEM THE BRIGHTNESS OF LIGHT IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BLUE SO IF YOU ONE AWEARE THEM WEAR THEM ORGES DIM THE LIGHTS OR TURN THE LIGHTS OFF SO LET SAY YOU  GO TO SLEEP AT I GET HOME AFTER THIS FOUR P M TO TWO A M SHIFT YOU MAYBE EAT SOMETHING YOU GO TO SLEEP AND YOU WAKE UP AND IT'S NOON OR ONE P M SHOULD YOU GET LIGHT IN YOUR EYES WELL YOUR FIRST ASSUMPTION BASED ON WHAT IHAVE SAID PREVIOUSLY MIGHT BE THAT YOU'REIN THE CRCADIAN DEADZONE THAT YOU CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S NONOR WANE P M BUT YOU'RE NOT IN THE CIRCADIAN DEDZONE BECAUSE YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO GOES TO SLEEP EARLY IN THE MORNING AT TWO A M SO IT'S NOT LIKE THE CIRCADIAN DEADZONE IS A STRICT TIME OF DAY IT'S AN INTERNAL BIOLOGICAL CLOCK SO WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU GUESSED IT YOU NEEDN'T KNW YOUR TEMPERATURE MENMU YOU NEED TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE TEMPERATURE IS INCREASING OR DECREASING AND NOW WE CAN MAKE THIS WHOLE THING EVEN SIMPLER AND YJUST SAY IF YOU'RE TEMPERATURE IS DECREASING AVOID LIGHT IF YOUR TEMPERATURE IS INCREASING GET LIGHT IT'S THAT SIMPLE OK IF YOUR TEMPERATURE IS DECREASING AVOID LIGHT IF YOUR TEMPERATURE IS INCREASING GET LIGHT THE THE SHIFT WORKER WHO WORKS FROM FOUR P M UNTIL TWO A M HAS A TEMPERATURE RHYTHM THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THEN MINE WHERE I WAKE UP AROUND SIX A M FIVE A M AND I GO TO SLEEP AROUND ELEVEN P M OK WE BOTH HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR ISH CIRCATIAN CYCLE EXCEPT MINE IS MORE ALINED TO TE RISE AND SETTING OF THE SUN AND THEIRS IS NOT RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR INTERNAL TEMPERATURE WITHTHEM AND KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK ROUND WITH A THERMOMETER WHEREVER TAKING YOUR TEMPERATURE ALTHOUGH BE GREAT IF SOME OF THE DEVICES THAT AR OUT THERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE COUNTING THEIR STEPS I I THIN IT BE GREAT IF PEOPLE HAD A A CIRCATIAN BODY TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT I'M NOT INVOLVED IN ANY THIS DEVICE DEVELOPMENT BUT THING IT'S A REAL CALL TO ARMS PUN INTENDED TO HAVE A RIST BAN THAT WOULD MEASURE TEMPERATUREAND WOULD TELL YOU YOUR TEMPERATURE MINNIMUM WHEN YOU TRAVELLER WHENT NOT I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IT MAY BE SOME OF THSE DEVICES ALREADY DO THAT BUT IF THEY DON'T THEY SHOULD IT'S ABSOLUTELY ABSURD TO ME WHY WE WOULN'T HAVE THE SIMPLE MEASUREMENT VERY EASY TO GET THAT KIND OF INFORMATION YOU ON'T EVEN NEED THE EXACT TEMPERATURE READ ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THE HIGH AND LOW POINT SO LET SAY YOU'RE SHIFT WORKER WHO REALLY IS NOCTURNAL YOU'RE FLET WELL YOU WANT A STAY ON THAT NOCTURNAL SCADUL NOW THAT CAN BE VERY HARD ON FAMILY IS IN SOCIAL LIFE OF ALL KINDS BUT THE PERSON WHO IS WORKING SAY FROM YOU KNOW EIGHT P M LIKE SUN DOWN TO SUNRISE THIS RAIYSEIS A QUESTION SHOULD THEY BE LOOKING AT THE SUNRISE AND SHOULD THEY BE WATCHING THE SUNSET WAKING UP WITH THE SUNSET GOING TO SLEEP WITH T SUNRISE YOU THINK WELL IS THAT LIKE IN TO THROW THEM OFF AH PROBABLY NOT IT'S JUST ASHLYGAN INVERT WHAT SUNRISE IN SUNSET ARE WHEN THEY'RE WAKING UP IN THE MORNING IF THEY LOOK AT THE YOU KOW THEY GET SOME SUNLIGHT IN THEIR EYES AND LOOK AT THE SUN GET SOME BRIGHT LIGHT FROM DEVICES OR OVERHEAD LIGHTS IN THEIR APARTMENT OR HOME WELL THAT'S GON INTEND TO WAKE THEM UP IF IT'S IN THE EVENING RIGHT  SO IT'S A YOU KNOTES I DON'T KN IF I SEE THAT CLEARLY BUT IF IN THE EVENING THE SUN IS SETTING AND THEIR LOOKING AT THAT SETTING SUN THAT IS THE MORNING SUN FOR THAT PERSON AND IT WILL WAKE THEM UP FOR THEIR NIGHT SHIFT SO TEMPERATURE RISING THEN TOWARD MORNING WHAT'S HAPPENING OK WIELE THERE CLOSING OUT THEIR WORKSHIFT YOU'RE GOING HOME THE SUN IS RISING DO YOU LOOK AT THE RISING SUN WELL THAYSTE ON WHAT YOU NOW KNOW YOUR EYES ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO RESETTING OF CIRCATING CLOCKS WHAT WILL IT DO AT THAT TIME IF THIS WERE A CLASS FROM I WOULD EITHER COLD CALL ON SOMEBODY YR IYE TO WAIT FOR THE PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE INEVITABLY EXISTS SO TEMPERATURE IS FOR THAT PERSON THEY'VE BEEN UP FOR A WHILE TEMPERATURE I IS FALLING NOT RISING FOR ME WOULD BE RISING BUT CAUSE I'M NOT DIERNAL I I'M AWAKE DURING THE DAY FOR THAT PERSON TEMPERTERES FALLING AND SO THEY VIEW LIGHT WHILE TEMPERATURE IS FALLING WHAT'S HIT CAN O DO S CAN A PHASE DELAY THEM IT'S CAN TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO GET TO SLEEP THE FALLOWING NIGHT SO YOU WOULD SAY THAT PERSON SHOULD WATCH THE SETTING SUN TO HELP THEM WAKE UP CAUSE THE'RE GON TO WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY HAVE SONE GLASSES ON OR AVOID VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHT BEFORE THEY GO TO SLEEP SU'S THE SAME THING THEY'RE JUST ON AN INVERTED SAS A TYPICAL PERSON WHOSE WHOSE DIURNAL BUT THEY'RE ON'T INVERTED SCEDULE I SO I'M REALLY TRYING HARD HERE TO MAKE THIS ALL REALLY CLEAR THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF TOO PATTERNS OF REQUESTS IN THE WORLD I'M NOTICING AS I'VE CIND OF VENTURED INTO THE THIS LANDSCAPE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND PODCAST THEY'RE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL WANT TO QUANTIFY EVERYTHING CAUSE THEY WANT TO GET EXACTLY RIGHT THESE ARE LIKE THE GRADUATE STUDENSEN SUDES THAT DON'T WANT TO MAKE A MISTAKE AND TO QUOTE MY GRADUATE ADVISER PROVIDED THE MISTAKES ARE NOT DANGEROUS CERTAINLY NOT LEATHFU YOU YOU CANTO WANT TO MAKE A FEW LITTLE MISTAKES SO THAT YOU CAN ADJUST RIGHT YOU KNO ONE TO ENDANGER YOURSELF BUT IT'S ACTUALLY YOU'RE NOTKINGTO GET THINGS PERFECT THAT'S CALLED LEARNING LEARNING AS WHEN YOU REALIZE I'VE YOU'D SUN THIS TIME AND THAT I STAYED UP AND IT REALLY MESSED ME UP I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN THE OTHER CATEGORY OF PEOPLE SEEM TO WANT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL KIND OF LIKE GIVE ME THIS PILL OR GIVE ME THIS PROTOCALL AND THOSE THINGS GENERALLY WORK BUT THY DON'T AFFORD PEOPLE FLEXIBILITY AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S THIS TEMPERATURE MINIMUM THING THAT I'VE BEEN JUST HAMMERING ON AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO DAY BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING T T YOU OWN AN THAT YOU CAN REALLY USE AS A KEYLANDMARK FOR SHIFTING YOUR CLOCK I UPPOSE THERE'S A THIRD CATEGORY WHICH IS PEOPLE WERE EXCEPT THAT BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ARE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE FOR GIVING THAN THE WAY THEY'RE SOMETIMES TO SCRAT AND I MANUSE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY EDITORIALIZE A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH MADE OF SLEEP DEBT LOOK THERE ISN'T AN IRASS EQUIVALENT FOR SLEEP THEY'RE NOT GIN TO COME AROUND IN TRYING COLLECT ALL THE SLEEP THAT YOU DIDN'T GET NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE GOING TO BE FOR YOU AND FOR ME AND FOR THE NEXT PERSON FOR THE SLEEP YOU DIDN'T GET YOU CAN'T REALLY RECOVER THE SLEEP YOU MISSED OUT ON BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO GET NAURODICALLY ATTACHED TO A SCATTUAL BECAUSE THERE'S A SINCLE SLEEP ANXIETY AND THEN PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP AND STAYING ASLEEP SI WANT O SPEND A MOMENT ON THAT AND GO BACK TO A THEME THAT I'VE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE BECAUSE THESE TOOLS WORK WHAT I CALLED ANESTY ARE NON SLEEP DEEPRESS TO THIS WOULD BE HYPNOSIS I GIVE YOU THE LINK BUT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN REVERI HEALTH DOT CALM FOR CLINICALLY TESTED RESEARCH TESTED FREE HYPNOSIS FOR ANXIETY BUT ALSO FOR SLEEP THOSE ARE VERY BENEFICIAL PEOPLE ENESTY ARE P ROTOCALS NON SLEEP DY BREAST PROTOCALS FOR THINGS LIKE YOGANIGRA I PROVIDE SOME LINK TO THOSE IN THE CAPTION FOR EPISODE TOO THESE THINGS REALLY WORK LAST NIGHT I WOKE UP I WENT TO BED ABOUT TEN THIRTY I WOKE UP AT THREE IN THE MORNING I KNEW I WAS IN FEELING RESTED I DID A ANESTY OUR PROTOCOL I FELL BACK ASLEEP I WOKE UP AT SIX THIRTY I YOU NEED TO TEACH YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM HOW TO TURN OFF YOUR THOUGHTS AND GO TO SLEEP AND I DEAL YOU DO THAT WITHOUT MEDICATION UNLESS THERE'S A REAL NEED YOU DO THAT THROUGH THESE BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALS THEY WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE INVOLVE USING THE BODY TO SHIFT THE MIND NOT TRYINGTO JUST TURN OFF YOUR THOUGHTS AND MILL THE NIGHT NOW THERE ARE PERIODS OF LIFE WHERE THINGS ARE STRESSFUL AND PEOPLE ARE CONCERN AND YOU WILL HAVE SOME STRUGGLE GETTING AND STAYING A SLEEP AND THERE'S THAT REALLY HAS TO DO MORE WITH ANXIETY WHICH AND IS SEE OUR PROTOCALS ALSO CAN HELP WITH AS I ALWAYS SAY DO THEM IN MILL THE NIGHT IF YOU WAKE UP ANDYOU WANT TO GO BACK TO SLEEP DURING THE MILL THE DAY TO TEACH YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM HOT TO CALME DOWN TO DO THEM FIRST THING IN THE MORNING F YOU DIDN'T FEEL YOU GOT ENOUGH SLEEP IN OTHER WORDS DO THEM WHENEVER YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THEM BECAUSE THEY REALLY CAN HELP YOU LEARN HOW TO TURN ON THE PARISYMPATHETIC SLASH CALMING ARM OF YOUR ONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THERE'S NO OTHER WAY THAT I'M AWARE OF TO TEACHER SYSTEM TO SLOW DOWN AND TURN OFF YOUR THOUGHTS AND GO BACK TO SLEEP BUT THESE ARE POWERFUL PROTOCALS AND HIS A LOT OF RESEARCH NOW TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT THEY CAN REALLY HELP MEDITATION WOULD BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE MEDITATION OF CERTAIN KINDS OF MEDITATION INVOLVE FOCUS AND ALERTNESS THOSE ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THEN MEDITATIONS THAT INVOLVE LACK OF FOCUS AND ATTENTION TO SAY INTERNAL STATES WHEN A PAUSE THERE AND THEN I WANT TALK ABOUT KIDS AND THE ELDERLY IN OTHER WORDS HOW DO WE CONTROL SLEEP AND CIRCATING RHYTHMS AND WAKEFULNESS IN BABIES ADOLESCENCE TEENS AND AGE FOLKS ARE BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT SLEEP IN KIDS I WANT TO TELL A LITTLE STORY SA NOT A JOKE I MANY YOU BE RELIEVE THAT I O CONTRANTILANOTHER JOKE THIS EPISODE UM WHICH IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIGHT SKIN AND PELLAGE COLOR DOPOMEN AND REPRODUCTION MATIN SO MANY SEASONALY BREEDING ANIMALS SIBERIAN HAMPSTERS WHICH I MENTION EARLIER RABBITS FOX OTHER ANIMALS CHANGE THEIR COLOR OF THEIR COAT IN THE WINTER THEY TEND TO BE A LIGHTER COLOR SOMETIMES OF PURE WHITE UM SOMETIMES WITH FLECKS OF BLACK OR BROWN AND IN THE SUMMER THEIR PELLAGE CHANGES TO A COLOR OF YOU DON'T BROWN OR RED SOME OTHER VASTLY DIFFERENT COLOR THAT SHIFT IS CONTROLLED BY LIGHT AND BY MELETONAN THIS HAS AN INTERESTING CORALET IN HUMANS SO HUMANS OBVIOUSLY HAVE DIFFERENT SKIN TONES JUST GENETICALLY BECAUSE O THE AMOUNT OF MELINEAN IN ONE SKIN DEPENDING ON GENETIC BACKGROUND BUT OF COURSE SUNLIGHT WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MELINAN IN THE SKIN REGARDLESS RIGHT THIS IS SUNTAN SUNBURN ET CETERA BRONZING WHATEVER THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS WIRED SO THAT SHIFTS IN SKIN COLOR AND SHIFTS IN THESE SELLS WITHIN THE EYE AND MELATONAN ARE ACTUALLY VERY CLOSELY LINKTH SO HERE'S THE STORY MANY YEARS AGO MEANING ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO ALL ITSE WAS A TWEN IT TWENTY YEARS AGO FORGIVE ME A GINAM EGI PREVENCIO WHO WAS RUNNING IS OWN LAB AT UNIFORMED ARM SERVICES THIS IS A O STANDAR BY LOGICAL LABORATORY DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS AN OPSEN IN THE EYE IN THE SELLS THE EYE THAT CONNECT TOD THE REST OF THE BRAIN CALLED MELONOPSEN MELINOPSEN AS YOU MANY OF YUNONO IS THE OPSEN IT'S LIKE A PIGMENT IT ABSORBS LIGHT IT IS THE OBSEN THAT CONVERTS LIGHT INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAN SET THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK EGE DISCOVERED MELONOPSEN BECAUSE IT WAS SIMILAR IN FORM TO WHAT WAS IN FROG MELANAFORCE  AS ACTUALLY IN THE SKIN OF FROGS THAT ALLOWED THOSE FROGS TO GO FROM PALE WHIGHT WHEN IT WAS DARK FOR MOST OF THE OF THE TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCLE TO PIGMENTED GREEN OR BROWN FOR A FROG SO THERE'S THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CELLS IN OUR EYE AND THE PIGMENT CELLS OF OUR SKIN AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN LONG DAYS THERE'S MORE BREEDING HOW'S THAT WORK WILL THAT'S ACTUALLY FROM DOPOMINE TRIGGERING INCREASES IN TESTOSTERONE MAINLY AN MALES AN ESTEROGEN MAINLY AN FEMALES OTHOTHE COURSESIS JU SACERAN ESTROGEN IN BOTH SEXES SO WE HAVE THIS KIND OF PATHWAY WHERE IT'S LIGHT INCREASES IN MELINAN DOPOMINE AND REPRODUCTION ON THE ONE HAND AND LACK OF LIGHT MELATONAN DECREASES IN THE DARKNESS OF SKIN LESS MELE MELINEN IN THE SKIN OR IN THE CASE OF AN ANIMAL WITH FUR WHITE FUR AND NO REPRODUCTION ON THE OTHER HAND AND HUMANS DON'T ACTUALLY SHIFT THEIR BREEDING PATTERNS TREMENDOUSLY FROM LONG DAYS IN SHORT DAYS THOUGHTHERE ARE SOME DATA THAT THEIR SUMSHIFTS WE ALSO DON'T RATICALLY CHANGE OUR SKIN COLOR DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH SUN LIGHT EXPOSURE WE HAVE BUT THE SIMPLE WAY TO PUT THIS IS WHEN DAYS ARE LONG THERE'S A LOT MORE DOPOMINE AND WE FEEL REALLY GOOD AND THERE'S A LOT MORE BREEDING AND BREEDING LIKE BEHAVIOR WHEN DAYS ARE SHOR ORT THERE'S A LOTLESS DOPAMINE AND A LOTLESS BREEDING BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THESE PATHWAYS ARE VERY HIGHLY CONSERVED NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT AS WEVE MOVED INTO A MODERN SOCIETY WHERE MUCH OF OUR WAKING DAYS WE ARE LOOKING AT SCREENS WHICH IS FINE CAUSE WE'RE GETING A LOT A LIGHT THAT WAY THOUGH NOT AS MUCH AS SUNLIGHT BUT ALSO AT NIGHT WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF LIGHT FROM SCREENS WHAT'S HAPPENED IS ALL THESE PATHWAYS MELONAN IN THE SKIN TURN OVER OF SKIN CELLS DOPAMINE ALL OF THIS STUFF HAS BECOME COMPLETELY DISRUPTIV NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD GO BACK TO A TIME IN WHICH WE DIDN'T USE ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE IS THAT FEELING GOOD WITH GETTING A LOT OF LIGHT THE RELATIONSHIP TO DOPAMINE AND MELONAN IN THE SKIN AND THE FEEL GOOD FEELINGS OF OF GETTING LIGHT ALSO ON OUR SKIN PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT GETTING BURNED OR YU NOT GETTING EXCESSIVE YOU VE EXPOSURE THOSE ARE NOT JUST COINCIDENCES THOSE ARE HARD WIRED BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT EXIST IN EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF OF HOW LIGHT ARE DARK YOUR SKIN IS TO BEGIN WITH THERE'S ANOTHER POINT WHICH IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS THAT THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM WHICH IS THIS FEEL GOOD MOLECULE IS VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN IN REPRODUCTIVE CYCLES REMEMBER MELOTONAN INHIBITS CANATITROPE AN RELEASING HARMONE LUTINIZING HARMONE AND THE PRODUCTION OF THESE OF THSE FOREMONS AND MELOTONAN IS THE EFFECTOR IT IS THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS SO I JUST THREW A LOT OF BIOLOGY AT YOU AND I'M NOT SAYING YOUARE LIKE A SIBERIAN HAMPSTER LEAST NOT IN WAYST AN U'M AWARE OF I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOUR PELLAGE COLOR IS GOING TO CHANGE ACTUALLY THE REASON PEOPLE GO GRAY IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE REALLY STRESSD DID YOU KNOWTICE THEY WHEN YOUE REALLY STRESSED THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE NERVE FIBERS THAT RELEASE A DRENALIN TO THE HAIRPHOLICAL AND THAT ACTIVATES PAROXIDE GROUPS IN THE HAIRPHOLICAL THAT CAUSE THE HAIR TO ACTUALLY GO GREY OR WHITE SO ACTUALLY STRESS DOES MAKE YOUR HAIR GREY OR WHIGHT AGING DOES IT TO THAT WAS A BRIEF ASIDE BUT FOR THOSE OF EITHER INTERESTED IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIGHT AND SKIN TONE AND ALL THAT KIND OFSTUFF I THOGHT YOU MIGHT FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THESE CELLS IN YOUR EYE ARE A LOTLIKE THE THESE A SKIN CELLS IN FROGS OR IN ANIMALS THAT A SHIFT THEIR ENTIRE COLOR AND  SOMETIMES METAMORPHOSIZE YET THERE'E SOME SPECIE THAT LITERALLY CHANE SHAPE IN THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS IN FACT IF THAT WASN'T WEIRD ENOUGH WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AT BERKLY THERE WAS ANOTHER GRADUATES TO STUDYING A SPECIES OF HERMAPHRODITIC MOLE MIED THE LITTLETHINGS IT DIG FOR MAPHREDATE MOLE THAT WOULD CHANGE FROM HAVING OVERIES TOTESTES AND BACK AGAIN DEPENDING ON DAYLIGHT SUPERCOOL SUPERDIFFERENT OM AND WHILE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW THOSE ANIMALS REPRODUCE THEY ACTUALLY ADJUST THE NUMBERS OF MALES AND FEMALES DEPENDING ON THE DENSITY OF MALES AND FEMALES OF THEIR TOO MANY MALES THE SOME OF THE MALES TURN THEIR TESTIES INTO OVEREASON IF THE TOO MANY FEMALES THEY TURN THEIR OVEREASON TO TESTIES THEY ACTUALLY ARE TRUE HERMAPHRODITIC ANIMALS I SUPPOSED TO SEUDOHERMAPHRODITIC ANIMALS BOKE LET'S GET BACK ON TRAC LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ANIMAL THAT MOST OF YOU CARE ABOUT WHICH IS THE HUMAN ANIMAL NEW PARENTS AND BABIES ARE I ASIT MENSION EARLIER MELATONE IN IS NOT CICKLIC IT'S NOT CYCLING IN BABIES IT'S MORE PHASIC ITS BEING RELEASED AT A KIND OF A CONSTANT LEVEL AND BABIES TEND TO BE SMALLER THAN ADULTS THEY ARE AND SO THOSE CONCENTRATIONS O MELTONE ARE VERY HIGH AS BABY GROWS THOSE CONCENTRATIONS PER UNIT VOLUME ARE GOING TO GO DOWN BABIES ARE NOT BORN WITH A TYPICAL SLEEP WAKE CYCLE AND NOW L THE PARENTS SAYING TELL ME SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW THEY ALSO HAVE AND I REALLY WANT EMPHASIZE THIS THEY ALSO HAVE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE OPTICTS OF THE EYE SO A NUMBER PEOPLE ABASK ME YOU KNOW SHOULD I BE EXPOSING MY BABY TO SUNLIGHT YOU DON'T WANT TO AVOID SUNLIGHT BUT THEIR EYES ARE VERY SENSITIVE THE OPTECTS OF THEIR EYES AREN'T QUITE DEVELOPED SO MUCH SO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT A NEW BORN BABY AND THEY CAN  THEY LOOK A LITTLE GLASSY EDED AND THER COND O LOOKING THROUGH YOU OR EVEN A YOUNG CHILD LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THEYR SEEING YOU THE WAY THAT YOU'RE SEEING THEM HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU BUT IF YOU A EVER CAN A JISGUGL A VISUAL IMAGE OF A LIKE AT ONE MONTH OLD THE OPTECTS OF THEIR EYES ARE SO POOR THAT YOUARE A CLOUDY IMAGE THEY'RE NOT SEEING YOUR YOUR FINE DETAIL AS THEY OPTICTS GET BETTER THEN THEY WILL SEE YOU WITH MORE AND MORE CLARITY BUT A LOT OF THAT IS CLEARING OF THE LENS AND SOME OF THE OTHER ACQUIOUS OM FEATURES OF OF THE NEWBORN EYE THEY DON'T SEE VERY WELL BUT THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE SUCH GREAT WAYS OF ADJUSTING TO BRIGHT LIGHT AND SO BABIES HAVE A NATURAL AVERSION TO BRIGHT LIGHTSO YOU REALLY WANT AVOID TRYING TO USE SUNLIGHT AR REALLY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD FOR AN ADULD ON A YOUNG BABY OR CHILD AS CHILDREN GET OLDER HOWEVER MELATONE AND DOES START TO BECOME SLIGHTLY MORE CICLIKE SLIGHTLY MORE CYCLED AND THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE RHYTHMS ALSO START TO FALL INTO A MORE REGULAR NOT QUITE TWENTY FOUR HOUR RHYTHM THEIR MORE OF THESE ALLTRADIANG RHYTHM SO ING EPISODE I THINK IT IS ONE OR TWO OF THE PODCASTS OR MAY BE BOTH WE TALKED ABOU THESE NINETY MINUTE SO CALLED ALTRADI AND RHYTHMS WHERE EVERY NINETY MINUTES BABIES ARE GOING THROUGH A CYCLE OF BODY TEMPERATURE AND SOME OTHER HORMONAL FEATURES AMENG THAT SO MUCH IS CHANGING IN THEIR SYSTEM SO WHAT TO DO IF A CHILD IS IN SLEEPING YOU CAN USE PHASES OF DARKNESS AND FA SIS OF LIGHT BUT THERE COAN'T HAVE TO BE SHORTENED IN ORDER TO TRY IND ENCOURAGE SLEEP WHEN YOU WANT THE CHILD TO SLEEP IT'S NOT THAT THERE JUST KNOCK ENOUGH FALL INTO AN ADULT LIKE REGIME OF A TEMPERATURE MINIMOMENT A TEMPERATURE MAXIMUM THERE TEMPERATURE MINIMUMS AND MAXIMUMS ARE FLUCTUATING MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND IT VERIES TREMENDOUS SLEE OM IN IT ACTUALLY ITS SORT THERE'S AN INTERESTING LITERATURE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SIBLINGS WHETHER NOT THEIR TWINS WHETHER NOT THERE IN A NURSERY ENVIRONMENT WHETHER OR NOT THERE ALONE OFFULLY THE BABES NOT ALONE BUT YOUKNOW WHAT I MEAN THAT THEIRE SLEEPING ALONE IN A ROOM WHILE YOU'RE IN THE OTHER ROOM THERE ARE COUPLE THINGS THAT SEEM TO HELP WHICH IS GETTING THE OVER ALL ENVIRONMENT AND TO A TWENTY FOUR HOURS SCHADULE SO HAVING THE ROOM SLIGHTLY COLDER OBVIOUS YOU WANT BABIES TO BE NICE AND COSY SLIGHTLY COLDER WHEN YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE ASLEEP SLIGHTLY WARMER FOR THE TIMES YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE AWAKE BABIES TEND TO BE RUN PRETTY HOT ANYWAY OM AND OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT AWAITING ALL EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE COLD OR OR HOT SO IF THEYRE GOIN THOUGH THESE NINETY MENUTE CYCLES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST THOSE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES AS WELL SO THEM PEOPLE SAY WILL THAT'S NOT CON T HELP ME AT ALL BECAUSE HOWDO IDEAL WITH THE FACT THAT I NEED TO BE UP EVERY NINETY MINUTES AT NIGHT THEY'RE COUPLE TOOLS THAT CAN BE HELPFUL THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO BE TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALM AND DEEP SLEEP SO THE AUNOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN PUT US INTO STATES OF YOULL PANIC WHERE THAT KIND OF SEESAW OF AUTONOMIC ALERTNESS GOES ALL THE WAY TO PANIC OR CAN BE ALERTNESS OR CAN BE ALERT AND CALM RIGHT SO THERE'S THERE'S A RANGE THERE TO CONTINUUM CAN ALSO BE THAT THE OM THAT YOU'RE IN DEEP SLEEP SO THE OTHER END OF THE SEASAWS WAY UP OR YOU'RE LIGHT SLEEP OR YOUR KIND OF SLEEPY OR YOU JUST FEELING KIND OF RELAXED PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IF YOU'RE HAVING TO MAP TO A BABY SCHEDULE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEI'R GETTING CHANGINGS AND NURSING AT CETERA OUT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES IS TO TRY AND MAINTAIN AS IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP OR YOU CAN'T SLEEP CONTINUEOUSLEE TO TRY AND MAINTAIN A YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IN A PLACE WHERE YOU'RE NOT GOING INTO HEIGHTEN STATES OF ALERTNESS WHEN YOU WOULD IDEALLY BE SLEEPING NOW I REALIZE THAT THIS COULD BE TRANSLATED TO TRY AND STAY CAM WHILE YOUR SLEEP DEPRIVED WHICH IS VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO DO BUT THIS IS WHERE THE NON SLEEP DE BREAST PROTOCAL SURFACE AGAIN AND CAN POTENTIALLY BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER NOT NECESSARILY SLEEP BUT FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AUTONOMIC REGULATION SO WHAT WOULD THIS LOOK LIKE THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE E BABY GOES DOWN MAYBE IT'S ONLYON TO GO DOWN FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF YOU CAN CAPTURE SLEEP TO APTURE SLEEP THERE ARE SOME DATA SHOWING WHAT'S CALL POLYPHASIC SLEEP IF YOU CAN SLEEP IN FORTY FIVE MINUTE INCREMENTS AR BATCHES EVEN IF ITS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITH PERIODS OF WAKEFULNESS IN BETWEEN AS MISERABLE AS THAT SOUND THERE ASHLY SOME ADULTSATIVE DELIBERATELY EMPLOYED THAT WHO DON'T HAVE CHILDREN FORSAKE OF WORK PRODUCT TIVITY AND IT DOES TEND TO REDUCE THE TOTAL OVER ALL AMOUNT OF SLEEP THAT YOU NEED IT IS A VERY HARD SCHEDUL FOR MOST PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN BUT IF YOU HAVE A BABY THE BABY MABE THROWING YOU INTO THAT KIND OF SCHEDUL ANYWAYS O IF YOUCAN GET FORTY FIVE MINUTES SLEEP WHILE THEY SLEEP GREAT IF YOU'N GET ANOTHER FORTY FIVE MINUTES AFTER WAKING AND THAN THEY GO BACK DOWN TO SLEEP GREAT SO AS MANY PHASES OF SLEEP AS YOU CAN GET BUT IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP THE DATA ON NON SLEEP DEEP REST TYPE PROTOCALS DOES SHOW THAT AT LEAST FROM A NER CHEMICAL LEVEL ON BE CLEAR WHAT THAT MEANS RESET OF THINGS LIKE DON'T BEMEAN LEVELS IN THE BASELGANGLEA MEASURED BY THINGS LIKE POSITRONOMITION TEMOGRAPHY ET CETERA THOSE THINGS TEN TO RESET THEMSELVES PRETTY WELL IF YOU CAN ACCESS THESE DEEP RESTATE SO THAT MEANS NOT BEING ALERT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME THAT THE BABYES SLEEPING TRYING TO SOR MIRROR THE BABYES SLEEP CYCLE WHICH CAN BE BRUTAL FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PREPARE MEALS AND DO ALL THESE THINGS SO I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'RE LOT OF CONSTRAINTS ON PARENTING NOT JUST MAPPING ON YOUR BABYS SLEEP SCHEDULE AS CHILDREN APPROACH AGES ONE TO THREE FOUR THAT'S WHEN CERTAINLY THE OPTECTS OF THE EYES HAVE IMPROVED BUT YOU' DON'T WANT TO DAMAGE THE EYES OF COURSE WITH VERY BRIGHT LIGHT THEY ARE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE EVEN UNTIL THERE KIND OF TEN ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND WELL TALK ABOUT VISION IN CHILDREN IN A MOMENT BUT TRYING TO GET LONGER AND LONGER BATCHES OF SLEEP THROUGH HOPEFULLY NOT THROUGH THE USE OF AD MINISTERING MELETONAN TO THE KIDS CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHY THAT COPOTENTIALLY BE DETROMENTAL TALK ABOUT THAT WITH YOUR DOCTOR BUT MORE SO TRYING TO GET LONGER BLOCKS OF SLEEP THAT MAP ON TO THESE ULTRADIAN CYCLES SO IF WE BETTER OFF TO GET A THREE HOUR LIKE TWO NINETY MINUTES CYCLES THAN TO FOUR HOUR BATCH OF SLEEP BECAUSE WAKING UP IN THE MILL THOSE ULTRADI AN CYCLES CAN JUST BE BRUTAL FOR PARENT AND KID SO IF ONE CAN'T GET A FULL SIX OR TEN OR SOME KITCHOUL YOU BEE SLEEPING TWELVE HOURS WHEN THEY'RE GOWING QUICKLY TRYING TO GET BATCHES OF SLEEP EVEN IF THEY'RE FRACTURED THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCL THET ARE MATCHED MORE TO THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCL'S MEANING MAYBE ONE ULTRADIAN CYCLE OF NINETY MINUTES OR TWO BACK TO BACK OR THREE BACK TO BACK TO BACK THAT'S GOING TO BE BETTER THAN WAKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ULTRADEAN CYCLE IT'S JUST GOING TO SET ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS IN A BETTER DIRECTION THAN WORRY YOU TO TRY TO SAY JUST IN FORCE OR FORCE A FULL EIGHT OR TEN HOURS OF SLEEP THAT'S AT LEAST WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS A SOME KID SLEEP GREAT THROUGH THE NIGHT STARTING IN A VERY YOUNG AGE OTHERS DON'T I TYPICALLY HERE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TREMENDOUS SLEEP THEY'RE LOSING THEIR MIND UNDERSTANDABLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SLEEPIN THEIR KIDS NOT SLEEPING AND OR THEIR KID O SLEEPING FOR SUCH BRIEF PERIOD SO ANOTHER WORDS TRYING TO ACCESS DEEP CALM IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP TRY AND ACS ES SLEEP IF YOU CAN SLEEP EVEN IF IT'S FRACTURED AND THEN YOU SAY WHAT ABOUT ALL THE SUNLIGHT VIEWING IN THE EXERCISE STUFF WHEN SLEEP IS REALLY REALLY DISMANTLED  MEANING IT'S HAPPENING IN VARIOUS TIMES OF DAY OR R NIGHT THAT'S ESPECIALLY ITAT THOSE TIMESS CAN BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE PARENT TO GET MORNING AND EVENING SUNLIGHT BECAUSE YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCK IS GOING INTO A TAIL SPIN AND IT BASICALLY WANTS TO ANCHOR TO SOMETHINGS YOU WANTIG GIVE IT TWO ANCHORS MORNING AND EVENING LIGHT CASO THIS IS RATHER DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I DESCRIBED FOR SHIFT WORK THIS IS WHEN THINGS ARE REALLY CHAOTIC N YOURE JUST NOT ABLE TO SLEEP SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES CAN ARISE IF YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF A VERY SICK LOVED ONE YOU'RE UP ALL NIGHT TRYING STAY CALM USING ANISTO OUR PROTOCALLS I KNOW IT'S HARDER TO TO DO THEN TO SAY BUT THOSE PROTICALS ARE THERE THEIR FREE THERE'S RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THEM TRY AND GET SLEEP WHENEVER YOU CAN BUT ALSO TRY TO GET MORNING SUNLIGHT AND EVENING SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES IF YOU CAN AND IF YOU CAN'T GET THAT USE ARTIFICIAL LIGHT WHAT ABOUT LATER LIFE SO KIDS NOW ADOLESCENCE TEENS IT IS TRUE THAT TENS HAVE A TENDENCY TO WAKE UP LATER AND GO TO SLEEP LATER IN PART JUST BECAUSE THEI'RE SLEEPING A LOT MORE THEI'RE THURNING OUT CANADITROPE AND RELEASING HARMON AND LUTINIZING HARMON THEIR WHOLE BODIES ARE CHANGING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER NOT PEOPLE REALIZE THIS BUT THE FASTEST RATE OF AGING THAT ANY OF US WILL EVER UNDERGO IS PUBRITY THAT IS THE FASTEST RATE OF AGING AND SO THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OF BIOLOGICAL PROSES THEIR HAPPENING DURING PUBERITY PROBABLY DEVOTE A WHOLE EPISODE TO PUBRITY IS A FASCINATING ASPECT TO THE LIFE LIFE COURSE BUT IT IS EXCELERATED PERIOD OF AGING AND THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK MECHANISM SOMETIMES ARE ARE ARE VERY INTACT AND SOMETIMES THERRE LITLE DISMANTLED IN GOING THROUGH SOME SOME CHANGE BUT PRIORATIZE THE DURATION OF SLEEP FOR ADOLESCENCE AND TEENS NOW IF THAT MEANS THEIR SLEEPING UNTIL TWO P M AND THEN WAKING UP AND THEN THEI'R UP ALL NIGHT THE UP ALL NIGHT PART CAN BECOME A PROBLEM THE SPECIALLY WITH ALL THE DEVISES TEXTING IN IN THEIR ROOMS OR PLANVIDIO GAMES MORNING AN EVENING SUNLIGHT WOULD BE IDEAL BUT SOME KITS ARE JUST CAN A SLEEP THROUGH THE MORNING SUNLIGHT HOWEVER IF YOU WERE TO MEASURE THEIR TEMPERATURE WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IS THAT THEIR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM WOULD COME LATER IN THE MORNING IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AIGHT A M IT'S GOIN TO BE MAYBEVEN TEN A M IF THEI'RE SLEEPING UNTIL ELEVEN OR TWELVE OR IT MIGHT BE AT A M IF THEI'R SLEEPING UNTIL TEN REMEMBER TEMPERATURE MINIMUMIS TWO HOURS BEFORE YOUR AVERAGE WAKING TIME TYPICALLY SO IN TEENS MAXIMIZES THE TOTAL MOUNT OF SLEEP TRY AND GET REGULAR SUNLIGHT EITHER IN THE MORNING OR IN THE EVENING OR BOTH BUT IF THEIRE SLEEPING THROUGH THE MORNING SUNRISE THAT'S PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE WAKING THEM UP AN DEPRIVING THEM OF SLEEP IS PROBABLY WORSE BECAUSE THEIR TEA MEN THEIR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS ACTUALLY FALLING LATER SO THEIRE CIRCADIAN DEDZONE IS LATER ET CETERA SO I THINK WITH ADOLESCENCE AND TEENS IT MAKE SENSE TOT CAN GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE ROPE IN TERMS OF ALLOWING THEM SOME LEE WAY TO ADJUST THEIR OWN SCHEDUAL SOME SCHOOLS ARE EVEN STARTING CLASSES LATER ON THE BASIS OF SOME VERY GOOD BIOLOGY TO SUPPORT THIS LATE SHIFTED RHYTHM IN THIS EXTENDED SLEEP FACE THERE ARE DATA FROM DOCTOR JAMIES IGHTSER PARMEN CYCOTRU BEHAVERAL SCIENCES AND OTHERS THAT STAMFORD SHOWING THAT TURNING ON THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM OF A TEEN BEFORE THEY WAKE UP HELPS THEM GET MORE SLEEP THE SUBSEQUENT NIGHT ALSO TRICKS THEM INTO GOING TO SLEEP ALOW BUT EARLIER BUT IT GIVES THM ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES MORE OF A DEEP SLEEP AND THAT'S BEEN SHOWN STATISTICALLY TOTAL SLEEP TIME INCREASES AS WELL IF THE'RE HIDING UNDER THE COVERS THAT'S NOCK IN A WORK BUT THEIR EYES DON'T HAVE TO BE OPEN I KNOW A FEW PARENTS NOW THAT ARE COMING IN WITH A FLASHLIGHT IN FLASHING THEIR KIDS O ON OVER THEIR EYELIDS BEFORE THEY WAKE UP IN HOPES OF GAIN THAS TO WORK SOME HOVE TOLD ME THIS IS WORKING AH THAT'S NOT PART OF IT A STANDARD STUDY OM BUT IT DOES SEEM TO WORK BECAUSE NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW WHY BECAUSE IF LIGHTS GETTING THROUGH THE EYELIDS AND IT SAY EIGHT A M AND THE KID IS STILL SLEEP AND THEY'E GAN WAKE UP AT TEN YOU'RE GIVING THEM LIGHT JUST AFTER OR AROUND THEIRE TEMPERATURE MENT  WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE THEM WON TO GO TO SLEEP EARLIER AND IN THE CASE OF TEENS FOR SOME REASON WE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND SLEEP LONGER ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES LONGER SPEND MORE TIME IN DEEP SLEEP ADULTS CAN DO THIS TOO IF YOU CAN PERSUADE SOME ONE OR PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON TIME OR FOR LIGHTS TO GO ON BEFORE YOU WAKE UP THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP YOU WAKE UP EARLIER AND SO IF YOURE STRNY HERE SOME SOME THEMES ARE REALLY RESOUNDING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT SHOULD BE REASSURING TO YOU RIGHT THERE THESE ARE COR MECHANISMS O THER FORTUNATELY THERE AREN'T A THOUSAND DIFFERENT MECHANISMS NOW IN THE ELDERLY THERE'S A REAL TENDENCY TO WANT TO GO TO SLEEP VERY EARLY AND WAKE UP VERY EARLY AND PEOPLE SHOULD TALK TO THEIR PHYSICIAN OM THERE ARE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT MELOTONE AND LEVELS AND PATTERNS AND MELETONEAN SECRETIING CAN BECOME A LITTLE CHAOTIC IN ELDERLY FOLKS WHAT DO I MEAN BY ELDERLY WELL IT'S GON TO DIFFER RATES OF AGING DIFFER RIGHT YOU SEE SOME SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLDS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO A MOVEIN AR AND SEEM MUCH OLDER THAN SIX SOME SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLDS THAT ARE YOU'NL STILL HUSTLING AROUND HAVE TONS OF ENERGY THERE'S A THERE'S LOT OF VARIATION SOME OF ITS GUNETIC SOME OF ITS LIGESTYLE FACTORS YOUT IT IT REALLY VARIES OM CERTAINLY LIFESTALE FACTORS CAN PLAIN IMPORTANT ROLL IN RATES OF AGING I THINK THAT THE THE MOST PROMINENT RESULTS FROM CER SLEEP INCIRCATIN RHYTHMS IN THE ELDERLY ARE THEY NEED TO GET AS MUCH NATURAL LIGHT EVEN OF ITS THROUGH WINDOWS I REALIZE THAT SOME ELDERLY FOLKS CAN'T GET OUTSIDE IS EASILY IT'S NOT SAFE FOR THEM TO DO IT THEY CAN'T MOVE AROUND AS EASILY EXERCISE CAN COME IN VARIOUS FORMS FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN'T GET OUTSIDE AND GET A TON A SUNLIGHT BY JOGGING OR CYCLING THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT LIGHT THROUGH A WINDOW IN THAT CASE OPEN WINDOW IDEALLY BUT FOR TEMPERATURE REASONS AT CETERA SOMETIMES THE WINDOW HAS TO BE CLOTHES GETTING PEOPLE NEAR THAT WINDOW IN AWAY FROM ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND AWAY FROM ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS CHURING THE NIGHT FASE CAN HAVE A TREMENDOUS EFFECT AND IN THE ELDERLY THAT'S WHEN MELOTONEAN MIGHT BE A VIABLE OPTION AND THIS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH A PHYSICION OF COURSE BUT YOU YOU WAY PAST THE PUBERITY TIME POINT IN MOST CASES PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND NINETIES ARE NOT CHURNING OUT A LOT OF GIANAR H IN LUTINIZING HORMONE TO BEGIN WITH AND THAT'S WHERE STRUGGLES WITH FALLING ASLEEP AND STAYING ASLEEP ALL THE SAME PERAMETERS AND THINGS WE'VE DESCRIBED BEFORE STILL APPLY LIGHT EXERCISE TEMPERATURE ET CETERA BUT THAT'S WHERE MELOTONEAN MIGHT BE OF GREATEST BENEFIT AND AGAIN I'M NOT PUSHING MELOTONEIN HERE BUT I THINK FOR ELDERLY FOLKS FOR HAVING TROUBLE FALLING AND STAYING A SLEEP THAT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE THERE ARE AND OF I SHOULD JUST ALSO MENTIOND THAT REGULAR SCHADULE FOR FOLKS THAT AR ELDERLY AND NATURAL LOT AS MUCH NATURAL LIGHT AS SAFELY POSSIBLE THAT THOSE AREGINGTO BE THE REALLY O THE KEY LEVERS FOR ADJUSTING SLEEP IN CIRCATEAN SCHADULES I'VE MENTION BEFORE IN PREVIOUS POD CASTS OTHER SUPPLEMENTS BESIDES MELOTONENT AND SOME OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTS ARE QUITE GOOD FOR SLEEP I YOU KNOWI'M NOT A SUPPLEMENT PUSHER I AM SOMEBODY WHO TAKE SUPPLEMENTS I BELIEVE IN THEM OM SOME HAVE WORKED FOR ME SOME HAVE NOT WORKED AS WELL BUT I CERTAINLY BELIEVE IN GETTING THE BEHAVIORS RIGHT WHETHER NOT ENESTY OUR PROTOCALLS VIEWING NATURAL LIGHT EXERCISE IT'S HOT BADS OR COLD SHOWERS OR WHAT HAVE YOU BEHAVIOUR OF PROTOCALLS FIRST THERE ARE SOME SUPPLEMENTS THAT I'VE MENTION PREVIOUS POD CAS BUT I'VE SEEM TO GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT SUCH AS ONE TAKE A COPPLEMENTS AND JUST TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR HELPING TURNING OFF THINKING ACCESSING DEEPER SLEEP AND EVEN BEING ABLE TO COMPACT YOUR SLEEP SCHEDUALE INTO A SHORTER PERIOD OF HOURS MEANING GETTING BY WELL WITH LESS SLEEP PEOPLE TAKE A LOT OF SLEEPING PILLS I'M NOT GN TO TELL PEOPLE NOT TO TAKE SLEEPING PILLS OH THEY CAN BE VERY PROPLEMATIC HAB IT FORMING ON HIGH SIDE EFFECT INCIDENTS IN MANY CASES SOME PEOPLE CAN HANDLE THEM JUST FIND OM THEGAIN NOT PHYSICIAN OM PROSCRIBE ANYTHING PROFESSOR I PROFESSOR LOT OF THINGS SOME OF WHICH ARE MY OPINION ALTHOUGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THERE'RE SOME IMPRESSIVE DATA ROUND SOME NON PRESCRIPTION DRUG TYPE SUPPLEMENTS THAT HAVE FAIRLY HIGH SAFETY MARGINS M THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER BUT YOU SHOULD TALKED YOUR DOCTOR ALWAYS BEFORE ADDING OR TAKING ANYTHING OUT OF YOUR HEALTH REGIMES RIGHT YOUR HEALTH IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO BE A STRINGEIN FILTER ALONG THOSE LINES ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL IN USEFUL TOOLS I'VE MENTION HERE ON MANY TIMES AND I PLAN TO MENTION MANY MANY MORE TIMES IS THE WEBSIGT EXAMINE NOT CALM WHICH I HAVE NO FILIATION WITH BUT IS A WONDERFUL SIGHT THAT LINKS YOU TO QUALITY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES RELATE TO JUST ABOUT ANY SUPPLEMENT INCLUDING SOME SAFETY WARNINGS OM WILL ALSO TELL YOU WHAT SUBJECTS WHETHER NI AS RATS CATS ELDERLY FOLKS OR KIDS THE I GIVEN STUDY WAS DONE ON WHICH IS IMPORTANT CAN BE KIND HARD TO O PULL FROM A SIGHTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE JUST ADVERTISING SUPPLEMENTS RIGHT THAT UALLY DON'T TELL YOU WHAT THE STUDY WAS AND UM WHO WERE THESE RATS WHO WERE THESE KIDS UM ET CETERA THERE ARE THREE SUPPLEMENTS THAT AT LEAST FOR ME HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUSLY POSITIVE EFFECT ON MY SLEEP THAT U  SOME OF YOU MIGHT CONSIDER UM I WOULD SAY IF YOUR DOING EVERYTHING PROPERLY BEHAVIOURLY N YOU'RE STILL HAVING ISSUES THEN SUPPLEMENTS MIGHT BE A GOOD THING FOR YOU OR IF YOU ARE TRAVELING AN YOU WANT A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA HELP IN BUFFERING YOUR SLEEP WAKEFULNESS PROTOCALLS UM SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO GO JUST TO THE SUPPLEMENTS THE LIKE WHAT SHOULD I TAKE I'VE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE THAT ON YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT TO TAKE YOU KNOW I'M MORE O EARE'S WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO OR NOT DO BUT M AND THEN THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE OR NOT TAKE BUT PERSONAL PREFERENCE AND UM FREE COUNTRY SO YOU DO WHAT DO WHAT YOU LIKE UM MAGNESIUM SO MAGNSIUM HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE THE DEPTH OF SLEEP AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DECREASE THE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT TAKES TO ACCESS SLEEP TO FALLS SLEEP COMES IN VARIOUS FORMS I'VE TALKED A BUNCH OF TIMES ABOUT MAGNESIUM THREE IN EH T EGH ARE E O AND A T E THREE IN ATE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE MORE BIL AVAILABLE FORM OF MAGNESIUM AND MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATE IT SEEMS IS SHUDDLED PREFERENTIALLY TO THE BRAIN WHERE IT HIS WHERE YOU WANT IT AND IT THERE CERTAIN TRANSPORTERS IS ACTUALLY ENGAGES THE GAB OF PATHWAY WHICH TENDS TO TURN OFF CERTAIN ARIES THE FOREBRAIN ALLOWS YOU TO AN A FALL ASLEEP THERE AR IS A STUDY IF YOU LIKE TO EXPLORE IT SINCE PEOPLE UM SERIOUS ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION MIGHT WANT EXPLORE THE STUDY WHICH IS EIGTISTS AT ALL EIGT S DOSE DEPENDENT ABSORBTION PROFILE DIFFERENT MAGNESIUM COMPOUNDS AM LOOKS TO ME LIKE E QUALITY PEREVIEWED PAPER  I CAN PUT THE LINK IN THE CAPTION AND IT EXPLORES ALL THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF MAGNESIUM A IT DOES SEEM LIKE MAGNESIUM GLICENATE CAN BE SIMILAR TO MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATE IN TERMS OF WHICH TISSUES IT SHUTTLE TO MAGNESIUM MALET MA L E T E IS PREFERENTIALLY SHUTTLE TO THE MUSCLE IT APPEARS AS POSET TO THE BRAIN SO ITS CAN BE MORE OF A MUSCLE REPAIR TYPE THING OR U RESTORING MAGNSIUM STORES IN THE PERIFERY ASPOSET TO THE BRAIN MAGNESIUM CITURATE UM HAS ANOTHER NAME THAT I WON'T MENTION UM IN JEST BECAUSE MAGNESIUM SCITUATES MAIN AEFFECT AT LEAST ON ME AND THE PEOPLE I KNOW SEEMS TO BE A LACIVE EFFECT UM AS OPPOSE TO A COGNIVE EFFECT THERE IS ALSO SOME EVIDENCE THAT MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATE CAN BE NEARO PROTECTIVE UTHOSE DATA A COME FROM QUALITY LABS MOSTLY RODIN STUDIES NOT HUMAN STUDIES WHAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING AND AGAIN THE SAFETY MARGINTS FOR THESE THINGS TEND TO BE PRETTY HIGH BUT AINTIME YOU TO TAKE SOMETHING NEW YOU SHOULD APPROACH IT WITH CAUTION SPECIE SINCE MAGNESIUM COULD BE INVOLVED IN A HEART RHYTHM AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THE OTHER SUPPLEMENT THE AT HAS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL FOR ME AS THEANINE SO THIS IS T H E A N I AN E THENINE T H E A N I N E THENINE ACTIVATE CERTAIN GABA PATHWAYS WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN TURNING OFF TOP DOWN PROCESSING AND THINKING MAKING EASIER TO FALL ASLEEP AND THENINE A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS HAS A CALMING OF FACT AM THENINE IS NOW SHOWING UP IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT A ENERGY DRANKS AN EVEN SOME COFFEES AS AWAY TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE IN GEST MORE OF A GIVEN TYPE O COFFEE CAUSE IT AM THE IDEAS THAY WOULD TAKE AWAY THAT THE GITTERS AND THE ANXIETY ALLOWING PEOPLE DRINK MORE COFFEE I'M TALKING ABOUT TAKING MAGNESIUM AND THEANINE THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE BEDTIME NOT DURING THE DAY TO QWELL ANXIETY BUT RATHER THIRTY O SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE BEDTIME WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD FOR ME HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE M AND THE COMMINATION OF THOSE TWO THINGS HAS REALLY HELPED THIENINE A FOR SLEEP WALKERS CAN BE A PROBLEM IT DOES INCREASE THE INTENSITY OF YOUR DREAMS GIVES YOU VERY VIVID DREAMS AM SO FOR SLEEP WALKERS OR PEOPLE THAT GET NIGHT TERRORS STAY AWAY FROM THENINE IS MY A ADVICE MAGNESIUM THENINE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO EXPLORE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE ISSUES WITH THE EMPHASIS ON MIGHT AND THEN I'VE TALKED ABOUT A COMPOUND AND LAST TIME I TALKED ABOUT THE A MECHANISMS OF APIGENIN WHICH IS A A DERIVITIVE OF CAMAMILE A P I G  N A WHICH ACXS AS A LOBIT OF A HYPNOTIC BY ACTIVATING CHLORI CHANNELS HYPEROPOLER AS NURONS INCREASES GABA IN THE BRAIN BUSY MAKES YOU FEEL E SLEEPY AM AND CAMAMILE FOR THOSE VIEW THAT RED YER UM A WAAS IT THE PETER RABBITS NUCK INTO MISTER MC GREGOR'S GUARD AN EIGHT THE CAMAMILE FELL SLEEP MISTER MC GREGOR CAME BACK O CANYONE FLASHING BACK TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL O KE AM THERE'S A STORY ABOUT CAMAMAL HAVING THESE KIND OF SET IT IF LIKE A FACTS APAGENAAS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED CAMAMAL ALSO HAS ANTRI ESTROGENIC EFFECTS SO IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR ESTERGEN UP YOU MIGHT WANT YOU A BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT APAGENIN THAT'S WHERE THINGS LIKE EXAMINED OT COM BECOME REALLY USEFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN GO TO EXAMINE YOU PUT IN APAGENIN AND THEY'LL TELL YOU ALL THE THINGS THAT IT DOES IN ALL THE THINGS THAT DOES CAN SOMETIMES INCLUDE THINGS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA LIKE REDUCING AM CONVERSION OF CERTAIN ANDRGENS TO ESTERGENTS WHICH YOU MIGHT LIKE OR YOU MIGHT WONT AVOID THAT'S UP TO YOU AND WHERE YOU WANT YESTERGEN LEVELS DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND GOLLS ARE FEW OTHER THINGS THAT CAN HELP THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP HAVE ARE THINGS LIKE FIVE H T P I'LL TRIPP TO FAN I'VE TALKED ABOUT WHY I'M NOT A FAN OF THOSE FOR ME THEY TEND TO THEROMIINTO DEEP SLEEP AND THEN I WAKE UP AND I CAN'T FALL BACK ASLEEP SO I DON'T LIKE TO TINKER WITH MY CERATONEAN SYSTEM I DON'TLIE TO THINKER WITH MY DOPAMINE SYSTEM FOR ENTIRELY OTHER REASONS BUT AM NONE OF WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNING IS JUST THAT I FIND THAT IF I INCREASE MY DOPE MEN BY TAKING AL TIRASENE I IN PIL FORM THAN I CRASH REALLY HARD THE NEXT DAY OR IF I TAKE FIVE AH KEEP YOR EL TRAP TRIP TO FAN I FALL DEEPLY SLEEP AND THEN I WAKE UP BUT I DIDN'T MENTION THAT THERE MIGHT BE WAYS TO MAKE SLEEP MORE COMPACTNAND SO THIS IS ACTUALLY REQUEST TO YOU I HAD A REALLY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE A WHEN I WAS A POSTTOCK I WENT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO AN ACUPUNCTURIST I KNOW THER VERYING UM THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS OUT THERE ABOUT ACUPUNCTURE UM I CAN'T SAY THAT I BENEFIT SO MUCH FROM THE ACUPUNCTURE UM THERE NOW QUALITY PEREVIEWED STUDIE SHOWING IT PUBLISH INNERON SEL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOWING THAT ACU PUNCTURE CAN STIMULATE SOME ANTINE FLAMETORY COMPOUNDS DEPENDING ON WHERE THE ACUPUNCTURE IS DONE THIS REALLY GOOD STUDIES CAME OUT LAST YEAR I TALKE ABOUT THIS ON INSTROGRAMA MAY TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN AS WELL AS CERTAIN ACU PUNCTURE SITS THAT INCREASE IN FLAMMATION  YOU KNOW I THERE YOU CAN GET DIFFENTYPES OF EFFECTS YOU CAN'T YOU SAY ACUPUNCTURERS GREAT CROSS THE BOARD AND UM I'M ASSUMING THAT THE ACUPUNCTURISTS KNOW WHICH SIGHTS ARE GOOD FOR INCREASING INFLAMMATION WHICH ONES ARE GOOD FOR DECREASING INFLAMMATION HOWEVER THIS ACUPUNCTREOUS THAT I WENT TO GAVE ME THESE RED PILLS HE SAID THESE ARE MINERALS FOR SLEEP AND IT WAS REMARKABLE I TOOK THE RED PILLS IS IN O THE THING NOW TAKE THE RED PILL I DON'T KNOWHAT THAT MEANS BECAUSE I'M NOT TUNED IN BUT  THESE RED PILLS LOOK LIKE LOTTLE EMONAMS I TOOK A COUPLE OF TEM ON HIS SUGGESTION AND I FELT DEEPLY SLEEP IN FOUR HOURS LATER WOKE UP FEELING INCREDIBLY RESTED MORE RESTED THAN I EVER FELT AN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I NEVER REQUIRED MORE THAN FOUR HOURS SLEEP UNFORTUNALLY ACUPUNCTUROUS MOVED AWAY I NEVER FORGET OUT WHAT WAS IN THOSE RED PILLS DIDN'T GET CHANCE TO DO THE MASPECT TOSIPY AND I STILL WONDER HE SAID THEY WERE MINERALS SO SOMEBODY OUT THERE KNOWS WHAT THESE RED PILLS ARE IN WHAT THIS COMPOUND IS AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE SO IF YOU KNOW UM PLEASE DON'T GO TAKING RED PILLS AT RANDOM TO TRY AND RECREATE THIS NON EXPERIMENT UM EXPERIENCE OF MIND BUT PLEASED DO CONTACT ME IF YOU FIND OUT OR IF YOU 'RE AN ACUPUNCTURIST YOU KNOW WHAT THESE MYSTERIOUS RED PILLS WERE BECAUSE THEY WERE PRETTY OSSOM ONCE AGAIN I'VE THROWN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AT YOU UM I HOPE YOU WILL FIGURE OUT YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM AND START WORKING WITH THAT TO ACCESS THE SLEEP AND WAKEFUL CYCLES THAT YOU WANT T ACCESS I HOPE THAT YOU'LL EXPLORE ANESTY ARE YOU MIGHT WANT EXPLORER SUPPLEMENTATION IF THAT'S YOUR THING YOU HAVE NOW ACCESS TO A LOT OF MECHANISM ABOUT SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS BUT IN KEEPING WIT THE THEME OF THIS PODCAST WHERE WE STAY ON TOPIC FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH OR EVEN SLIGHTLY MORE WE ARE NOT DONE WITH SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS I KNOW THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE TYPICAL PODCAST FORM AT WHERE ONE WEEK GETS HOW TO BECOME SUPERHUMAN AND THE NEXT WEEK GETS HOW TO UM YOU KNOW DEVELOPED GROWTH MINES AND HIS COUNT ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH EPISODE EPISODE WE ARE STAYING ON TRACK BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE THAT AS WE DRILL DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THESE MECHANISMS AND YOU START HERING SOME OF THE SAME THEMES AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU WERE GOING TO START TO DEVELOP IN INTUITION AN AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE SYSTEMS WORK IN YOU AN YOUR PARTICULAR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MY GOAL IS REALLY TO EVENTUTO BECOME OBSILETE IT'S WHAT MY GRADUATE ADVISUR USED TO CALL THE HI BY A BUSS I'M PRINCIPLE IM SAID AE SOMEWHAT I MORBID SENSE OF HUMOR AND USED TO BE WELLIF I GET BY ABUSS TO MORROW WHAT YOU GAN TO DO I'M WITHOUT ME BLABBING AT YOU HEAR SO I DON'T WANT TO GET HIP BY A BUSS I PLAN ON LIVING A VERY LONG TIME IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT BUT WERE I TO GET HIT BY A BUSS TO MORROW WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR YOUR SLEEP IN WAKEFULNESS I YOU CAN PUT A COMMENT ON YOU TO WHICH I HOPE YOU WILL DO BUT IF I WERE HIT BY A BUSS AND KILLED THAN YOU I WIN BE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SO KNOW YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM UNDERSTAND LIGHT IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY IS VALUABLE LIGHT WHEN YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE PROVIDE IT'S NOT SO BRIGHT IT'S DAMAGING IT'S GRAPE FOR YOU WHETHER NOT COME FROM SCREENS OR SUNLIGHT BUT SUNLIGHTS BETTER AVOID LIGHT IN THE FORTY SIX HOURS BEFORE YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM OR ELSE YOU'R GEN A DELAY YOUR CLOCK UNLESS YOUR TRAVELING AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO MOKI YOUSE TEMPERATURE INCREASE TEMPERATURE TO SHIFT YOUR CLOCK DECREASE TEMPERATURE TO DELAY YOUR CLOCK MKI MAP OUT YOUR TEMPERATURE AND UNDERSTAND IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW DEGREE BY DEGREE ACROSS THE DAY KNOW YOUR MINIMUM KNOW YOUR MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE IN YOUR TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE AND YOU FEEL GREAT POWER THROUGH THAT BECAUSE THEN YOUWILL KNOW ALSO ABOUT THESE ALTRADIAN CYCLES THESE NINE UMINUTE CYCLES WITHIN WHICH YOU CAN DO FOCUS WORK DON'T EXPECT THE FOCUS TO COME EARLY EXPECT THE FOLKSTO COME IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN CON A TAPER OFF TALK TO LOBIT ABOUT KIDS LOBE  ELDERLY BOUT PARENTING WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE BUT NOW SHIFT WORKERS TRAVELERS PEOPLE THAT ARE JET LACKING THEMSELVES AT HOME YOU NOW HOW LEVERS IN PLACE INFORMATION CAN BE POWERFUL BUT YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT IT IN WAYS OBVIOUSLY SAFEWAYS IN REASONABLE WAYS BUT IMPLEMENTING THIS KNOWLEDGE IN THE WAYS THAT YOU TRUST ARE SAFE AND REASONABLE FOR YOU IS GOING TO BE THE WAY THAT YOU CAN DEVELOP A BIT OF A LABORATORY ABOUT YOURSELF I LOATHE THE TERM BYO HACKING SORRY BYOHACKERS I DON'T BELIEVE IN HACKING ANYTHING I BELIEVE IAN UNDERSTANDING MECHANISM AND APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES OF MECHANISM FOR WHICH THERE ARE LARGE BODIES OF QUALITY PERE EVIEW DATA AND EVEN A WHOLE CENTERE OF MASS AROUND CERTAIN BIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES LIKE THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE TEMPEATURE MINIMUMS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO SHIFT YOUR BIOLOGY IN THE WAYS THAT YOU WANT TO GO THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO SHIFT YOUR PCYCHOLOGY IN THE WAYS YOU WANT TO GO NEXT PODCAST EPISODE WE ARE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL ORGAN  ANSWER MORE OF YOUR QUESTIONS CAUSE DURING OFFICE HOURS AT DIDN'T GET TO ALL YOUR QUESTIONS FROM THE PREVIOUS EPISODE SO I DO READ THE COMMENTS IN AND WERE PAYING ATTENTION AND FIGURING OUT THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS WE ARE GOING TO GET TO SOME OF THE HARDER TOPIC SOE ONE CAME AT ME IT'S ALWAYS FUN WHEN SOMEBODY DOES AS THINKS IT WILL THESE ARE JUST THE KIND OF BAZAL LOW LEVEL CUUSTIONS WHAT ABOUT THE BIG STUFF WHAT ABOUT DREAMING AND LUCID DREAMING AND CONSCIOUSNESS LOOK I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT STUFF AND I'M PLAN TO DO THAT SOME OF WHICH IN THE NEXT EPISODE IN THE FALLING EPISODE MAY BE EVEN BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU OU DATA I WANT TO GIVE YOU THINGS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY DATA SO I WILL TRY TO SPECULATE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THIS IS A PODCAST ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE PACE TOOLS FOR EVERY DAY LIFE THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME SPECULATING MANY PEOPLE SPECULATED ABOUT THE ROLE OF SLEEP DREAMING AND CONSCIOUSNESS FASCINATING TOPICS AND A RATHER CIRCULAR ARGUMENT FRANKLY 'S BEEN GOING ON FOR CENTURIES SOME DAY WILL GET THERE RIGHT NOW WERE CONCENTRATING ON THESE DEEP BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT MAKE YOU WHO YOU ARE AND ALLOW YOU TO FEEL CERTAIN WAYS GOOD OR BAD

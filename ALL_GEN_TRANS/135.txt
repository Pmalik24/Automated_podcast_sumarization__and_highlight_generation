ENTRY THE BIDAN ADMINISTRATION HAS ACKNOWLEDGED TOT THIS WAS NECESSARY THEY PUT FORAR TO STATEMENT SAYING AS MUCH SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS THE WAY THAT THIS WAS GOING TO GO THAT BASICALLY WE NEED THE WALL IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE WALLS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO SECURE THE BORDER THIS OF COURSE GREATE THE MAJOR CON UNDRUM BECAUSE JOBIDON SUGGESTED DURING THE TWENTY TWEN Y RACE THAT WALLS ARE BAD THEY ARE IN EFFECTIVE THEY ARE USELESS AND INFACT THE IDEA OF THE TRUMP WALL WAS INCREDIBLY BAD RACES TERRIBLE IS WHY YOU HAD OL GENERAL COSO QUORTEZS DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION JHETTING ON DOWN TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER TO HANG AROUND EMPTY PARKING LOTS AND FAKE CRY INTO THE CAMRA OVER OVER OFFENCE THIS IS WHY YOU HAD THE ENTIRE MEDIA SHRIEKING AND CRYING ABOUT THE IDEA OF DONAL TROMP BUILDING MORE BORDERWALL THE'S WHY JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO YOU HAD JUDGES WHO ARE STEPPING IN TO PREVENT THE  GOVERNOR OF TEXAS GREGG ABBOT FROM PUTTING BOUEIS IN THEMIDDLE OF THE REO GROUND FPREVENT PEOPLE FROMHE LEGALLY ATTEMPTING TO CROSS THAT BORDER WELL NOW THEY AVE FLIPET NOW THEYAVE FLIPT AGAIN IT IS NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO THEY WERE SAYING ALL THE SORT OF STUFF THE AS AS OFE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

FEEL THAT IT IS A POLICY THAT DOESNT WORK AND IS NOT JUST US AIT EXPERTS HAS SAID THAT  THE BORDERWALL IS NOT A IT'S NOT AN EFFECTIVE POLICY THAT WAS THE ADMINISTRATION JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO WHAT CHANGED WELL TURNS OUT MILLIONS PEOPLE HAVE CROSSED THE SOUTHERN BORDER UNDER JOBITON AND THEY ARE ALL GOING UP TO NORTHERN CITIES BLUE CITIES NEW YORK CHICAGO AND TURNS OUT THAT PEOPLE IN TOSE BLUE CITIES DON'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH YOU GOT GOVERNORS LIKE CATHY HOCAL IN NEW YORK CALLING OUT THE BYT ADMINISTRATION YOUHAVE THE GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS JABY PRITZKER AND THE MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON OF CHICAGO CALLING FOR JOBIDON FIX THIS THING HERE THEY WERE JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO WE HAVE TO HAVE BETTER POORNATION WITH EVERY STINGE LOVEL OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT IFLUDS THE STATE OF TEXES THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THE FEDERAOER CAN TDO OTHER THAN SENDING ES MONEY BUT THEY HAVEN'T YET DONE E NO LETTER TO PRESIDENBIDON ASKING FOR MORE HELP GOVERNOR FRITZKERS TAS THE CRISIS HE'S OVERWHELMING THE STATE IN THE CITY'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE AID IT WILL ALL OF THIS HAS DRIVEN THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION INTO SOME DOSE OF REALITY OR LEAST IT DID BRIEFLY THERE'S A BRIEF MOMENT IN TIME JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND IT APPEARED T THE BY ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE SHOCKED INTO REALITY MAYBEN TO STOP THE OVERWHELMING FLOT OF LEGLIPMIGRANS AT THE BORDER MAY ORKC A SEND AN AN OFFICIAL FILING IN THE FEDERAL REGISTERS IS JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS GO QUOTE THERE IS PRESENTLY AND ACUTE AN IMMEDIATE NEED TO CONSTRUCT PHYSICAL BARRIERS AND ROADS IN THE VICINITY OF THE BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO PREVENT UNLAWFUL ENTRIES INTO THE UNITED STATES IN THE PROJUGAREAS IN ORDER TO INSURE THE EXPEDICIOUS CONSTRUCTION OF THE BARRIERS AND ROADS IN THE PROJUGAREAS I HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT IS NECESSARY EXERCISE AT THE AUTHORITY VESTED A ME BY SECTION ONE OR TO SE OF THE I I R I R A HE'S OUT YOU WAIVE REGULATIONS IND ORD T MAKE THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENED BUT THEN WOKENIST SNAPED BACK INTO PLACE LIKE A MAUSETRAP THERE IS NO WAY THE BY ADMINISTRATION WAS CAN BE ABLE TO FLIP THIS DRAMATICALLY AFTER CLAIMING THAT DONAL TRUMPLETON EVIL HUMAN RITES VIOLATOR FOR TTEMPTING TO BUILD BORDERWALL AND SO YESTERDAY JOBIDN THE DEFUNCT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SUGGESTED THAT ACTUALLY THE BORDERWAL WON'T WORK WHICH RAISE THE QUESTIONIS T WHY THEN THEY ARE BUILDING IT BUT E SAYS GUYS GUIS ITS ITS STO LOCK ON A WORK OT I DIDN'T CHANGE MY MIND IS SO LOCK ON WORK WHICH IS BUILDING IT CAUSE WE HAVE TO BUILD IT WHICH IS WEIRD SINCE YOU HAD TO WAVE TWENTY SIX REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO BILD IT HERE IS JOBINE YESTERDAY SO THEN WHY ARE YOU DOING IT SO I YOU DOING IT THE ANSWER IS THAT HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE HE ALSO KNOWS THAT THE CONSEQUENCE IF NOT DOING IT ARE REALLY BAD POLITICALLY BUT HE STILL HAS TO PLEASE HIS LEFT WING AT BASES HE HAS CREATED A SITUATIONI WHICH HE IS CAUGHT BETWEEN ROCK AND HARDPLACE IS A CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR HIM AND THE SAME WITH THE CRIME POLICYS A CATCH TWENTY TO IF CRIME GOES OUT A CONTROL IOOKS REALLY BAD FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION IF HE ADSMORE COPS TO THE STREETS IT ALSO LOOKS REALLY BAD FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION LEFT WING POLICY IS A FAILURE WHEN YOU PURSUEIT TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION WHICH IS AN OPEN BORDER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND THEN YOU HAE TO BACK TRACK AND THAT HE WILL YELLIT YOU FOR BACK TRACKING AN THIS WAT JOBIDON DOESN'T WANT TO WHAT EXACTLY IS JOBIDINS EXCUSE FOR HAVING SPENT THE MONEY TO YOU KNOW ACTUALLY BUILD WALL HE SAYS THE MONEY WAS APPROPRIATED SO HE HAVE TO SPEND IT WHICH AGAIN IS WEIRD FROM A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHOS UNALATERALLY DECLARED HIMSELF THE ABILITY TO RELIEVE STUDENT LONDEBT TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF BUILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY ALICATED FOR BORDER WALL FUNTING SUDDENLY WLIKE RIHT NOW HE DIS GOVERED THE ACTUALLY HAS TO SPEND MONEY THOSE APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY NINETEEN STRANGE P TRIONWUT I MEAN YOU COULD THEOREDICALLY YOU COULD SAY WE COULN'T WAVE THE REGULATION SORRY I THAT BE THE ESES EASY WAY TO DO IT THEY LITERALLY HAD TO WAVE REGULATIONS IN OR TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO THEY COULD HAVE MADE THE CASE  SECRETARY MAYORICUS EASILY COULDN'T MADE THE CASE GOT I WANT TO SPEN TE MONEY BUT THE REGULATIONS PREVENT ME FROM SPENDING MONEY TBECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A BE INVIOLATION OF LIFE I DID SPEND MA NOT DOING THAT HE'S BUILDING THE WALLS THE ONE HAVENIT BOTH WAYS AGIN THO ONE BUILD THE WALL CLAIM THE WALL DOES NOTHING SO THEY CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY CLAIM THERE DOING SOMETHING STOP THE BORDERFLOW AND ALSO CLAIM TO ALL F THEI'R LEFT WING

BUT THIS IS THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU TAKE POSITIONS THET ARE COUNTER LOGIC AND DECENCY AND THEN THE EFFECTS OF THOSE THOSE POLICIES COME TO FRUITION YOUEVE THIT SOMEHOW MITAGATE AGAINS YOUR ON POLICIES THE REASON THIS IS HAPPENING IS VERY OBVIOUS YOU GOT PEOPLE IN NEW YORK AND PEOPLE IN CHICAGO AND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE LEFT WING THE BIG CITIES BIBLUCITIES ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT JO BIDONS ILLEGAL EMIGRATION PROBET THERE IS A REASON BY THE WAY THAT YOUR BIDN IS DOING THIS AND THAT IS BECAUSE HIS POLL NUMBERS ABSOLUTELY STINK HIS POLL NUMBERS ON EMIGRATION ARE BENOT

FASCINATING NEW TWIST TO THE SPEAKERSHIP BATTLE APPARENTLY THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOW GOING TO HOLD A SPEAKERSHIP DEBATE APPARENTLY TELIVIZED WHICH IO KAY ALL RIHHE I HERE'S MY OBJECTION TO THIS MY ONLY OBJECT I'M ALL FOR TRANSPARENCY BUT WHO REPUBLICANS ALECKE IN A CLOSED CAWCAS TO LEAD THEIR CAWKAS REALLY SHOULD NOT BE A A MATTER OF PUBLIC SCRUTINY NEARLY AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW YOU VOTING FREE TO LOCAL CONGRESS PERSON THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE HOW THE SAUSAGE GETS MADE IS VERY DIFFERENT THEN HOW PEOPLE TELL YOU THE SAUSAGE GETS MADE ON TALK RADIO AND ON TALK GRATE   WHAT I DO FOR LIVING I MOAIN TO GIVE YOU THE PUREST MOST CONSERVATIVE PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I GET TO DO I MAM I'M LUCKY OT ON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE SAUSAGE BUT BEHIND THE CLOSED DOORS OBVIOUS THERE'S WEALING AND DEALING TRADES GET MADE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT INSSENTIVE STRUCTURE S COMPLETELY SCEWE YOU CAN I SHOULD GET THE DEAL DONE YOU CAN'T ELECT TO SPEAKER UNLESS THERE'S SOME DEALS THAT ARE ETING MADE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND THIS IS FOR EXAMPLE I'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE REPUBLICAN FIGHT AGAINS YEAR MARKS SO OR YEARS AN YOURS IN YOURS REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID QUITE CORRECTLY ON PRINCIPALE OURRACKS ARE REALLY BAD THEY ARE THEY'E REALLY BAD YOURE MARKS O THE SYSTEM WHEREBY THERE'S A BILL IT'S COMING THROUGH AND I ATTACHED A RIDER FRY DISTRICT AND I SAY I'M ONLY GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE SPILL IF YOU BUILD THE BENSHIPPEREO POST OFFICE IN MY DISTRICT AN'S REALLY BAD BECAUS IF EVERYBODY DOES THAT YO UND OF SPENDING LOT OF MONEY THE PROBLEM IS IF NOBODY DOES THAT YOON'T PASS ANY BUILLS AND YOU IN E THY GIANT OMNIBUS PACKAGE THAT ONLY GET SUPPORT BECASE THE GIANT CRAP SAND WHICH ANYWAY USUALLY A LARGER CRAPSANDWHICH THEN WOULD AVE BEEN ATTAINED WITH A FEW SIMPLE ERMARS SO AND GAIN THE SAUCSAGE MAKING PROCESS IS REALLY UGLY TELIVIZING ALL OF THAT AIN'T THAT'S THAT'S GRAY WOV PROLONGING THE SPEAKER CHAOS I SUPPOSE BECAUSE YOU'RE GIN TO AND UP WITH A A SEGMENT THAT IS VERY PROACHIM JORDAN YOU N NOT UP WITH A SEGMENT THAT IS VERY PROE HEAVEN HERN FOR EXAMPLE YOU'LL THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS THOUGH ANY ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES IS COMPLETELY DOMINATE SO THE THREE BIG CANDIDATES WOUVD BEN MENTIONE AT THIS POINT OR STEVESKILLYS JIM JORDAN AND REPUBLICAN STUDY COITTEE CHAIR CEVEN HERN OF OCLOHOMA APPARENTLY A CORIN PUNCHPAL NEWS FOX NEWS BRET BARE IS GIN A HOST A CLOSED IT DEBATE AND DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE JEOPE CANDIDATES FOR SPEAKER ON MONDAY NIGHT ACCORDING TO A SORCE INVOLVED WITH THE PLANNING AND THEN LATER IT CAME OUT APPARENTLY THER'S ARE GON TELIVIZE THAT WHICH A IT'S CAN BE VIR IF YOU ARE RUNNING FOR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NOW YOU'RE BASICALLY KIND OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT RIGHT NOT NOT FORMALLY BUT YOU'RE GETTING IN FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THE REPUBLICAN BASE AND SHOWING WHO HAS MOST FEALTY TO CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU CAN SHOW THAT FEALTY BUT THE SYSTEM CONSTRAINS YOU FROM ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THOSE GULLS YOU MAKE THE BIGGEST PROMISING PROMISE O EVERYTHING O EVERYBODY TWO MINUTE FROM NOW EVERIS N WE REAL DISAPPOINTED WHEN WE HIT THE END OF THE CONTINUANG RESOLUTION AND SOMEBODY CUTS TO DEAL WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS WE ALL KNOW ANYWHERE PUBLICANS ARE GIN A HOST THAT CANDIDAVE FORM TUESDAY NIGHT AND THE CLOSE PARTY ELECTION ON WEDNESDAY THERE IS NO TIMELINE FOR ELECTING A SPEAKER ON THE HOUSE FLOOR THIS THING IS PROBLICAN CONTINUE FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS DONALD TRUMP FOR HIS PART HE A AFTER ORIGINALLY RECOMMENDING CEV MC CARTHY FOR THE POST MC CARTHY WAS VERY PRO TRUMP AND THEN DOING NOTHING TO STOP COVENMC CARTHY FROM FALLING DONALD TRUMP THEN NUM APPARENTLY STARTED SHARING POSTS ON TRUTH SOCIAL PITCHING HIMSELF AS THE SPEAKER AND CALLING COVEN MC CARTHY A TRAITOR WHICH IS AS ALWAYS NO ONE IS MORE LOYAL THAN PRESENT THE MOSAS  IN AN ANICAS DONALD TRUMP IS NOW IN DORSING JIM JORDAN FOR SPEAKER  JUST FINI I REALLY LIKE JIM JORDAN I THINK HE'S TERRIFIC THE EAD OF THE HOUSE OVERSIKE COMMITTEE AT GAND I KNOW I AM WANTS THIS JOB THE TERRIBLE JOB BUT JIM JORDAN IS AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE HE'S ONE O THE FOUNDERS THE OUSE FREEDOM CALKAS HE'S EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE ACROSS THE BOARD AND AS FAR AS TRUMP GOES TO BIG TRUMP BACKER NOW THE PROBLEM IS OF COURSE WERE ALSO IN TH MIDDL OF AN OPEN PRIMARY INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHILE TRUMP IS WAY IN FRONT IN THAT PRIMARY HES STILL REPRESENTS ABOUT HALF OF THE REPUBLICAN PART Y AND THE OTHER HALF THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY IS SPLIT AMONG A MYRIAD OF CANDIDATES JO TRUMPSON DORSEMAN HE'S NOT SURE TO GUARANTEE THAT SOMEHOW JORDAN BECOMES THE GUY ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLE WING OF MODERATES IN H PARTY WHO MAY NOT BE IN LOVE WITH JIM JORN CEV MC CARTHY PEOPLE RIPPED HIM FOR NOT HAVING CENTRALIZING PRINCIPLES AND TO A CERTAIN EX ENT THERES SOME TRUTH TO THAT BECAUSE HE'S A CONSUMMATE POLITICIAN ANHY KIND O HAVE TO BE IN ORD TR BE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND BROKE OR SOME SORT OF A GREEMENT BETWEEN ALL THESE DISPERICT GROUPS YET CAN'T REALLY BE A GUY WHO HAS SORT OF HARD AND FAST PRINCIPLES UNLESS YOU CAN BE A DICTATOR LIKE NEW GINGRICE WAS VERY EARLY ON WHEN HE WAS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AN THAN HE ENDED UP BEING TEFEND A STRAITED ANYWAY AFTER A CERTAIN POINT BEING A IDDEALIST IN BEING SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ARE USUALLY NOT THINGS THAT GO TOGETHER THIS 'S WHY MISH MAC CONAL'S A VERY EFFECTIVE SEN AT MAJORITY LEADER BUT NOT THE MOST IDEOLOGICAL POLITICIAN USUALLY THESE TWO THINGS ARE IN CONFLICT IF YOUN'T BE PER TICULARLY EFFECTIVE IS LEGISLATURE AS LEGISLATOR USUALLY THAT MEANS NOT BEING A PURIST IN ANY CASE JIM JORDAN IS MORE OF A PURIST THATE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MODERATE DISTRICT IN NEW YORK MAYBE WHO MAGHT NOT LOVE JIM JORDAN STEVESKALLEES IS CONSIDERED AGAIN SORT OF THE EPARTY FAVERIT IN THE SENSE THAT HE'S NOT COMING IN FROM THE OUTSIDE HE WAS A SECOND N COMMAND TWO CKEVEN MC CARTHY THER HEALT CAN CERNS ABOUT STEVESKILLEES THERE'S NOW BEEN SOME TALK BELIEVE OOR NOT ABOUT PATRICK MAC HENRY POSSIBLY NOT BECAUSE PATRICK C HENRY ACTUALLY HAS A LOT OF ACKING BUT BECAUSE HE'S THE SPEAKER PROTENSY SORTE JUST SITTING THERE LREADY IN ORDER FOR ANY SORT OF SPEAKERSHIP VOTE TO HAPPEN THE BIG THING THAT'S CAN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN IS THEIR GOIN TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE MOTION TWO THEY CATE RULE THE MOTION VACATE RULE WHICH IS A CONSESSION MADE BY KEV MC CARTHY TWO TE MACKATESWING O THE PARTY WAS THAT HE WOULD ALLOW ANY ONE ANYLIKE A SINGLE PERSON TO BRING A MOTION TO VACATE THE CHAIR IF THEY DIDN'T LIKEWHAT HE WAS DOING AN THAT BASICALLY SET THE STAGE FOR HIM BEING OUSED AN N ANY POINT BECAUSE H HAS VERY VERY NARROW HOUSE MAJORITY ALL IT TOOK WAS BASELY FIVE RE PUBLICANS VOTING AGAINST HIM AND HE WOULD LOSE HIS SPEAKERSHIP EVEN IF THE OTHER NINETY SEVENEN PERSOUT OFTHE CALKAS WAS IN FAVOR OF KEN MC CARTHIAN IN FACT THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN SO IN ORDER FOR ANY NEW SPEAKER TO BE ELECTED AND THE HAVE ANY POWER AT ALL THAN MOTION TO VACATE IS GOIN TO HAVE TO BE CHANGED AN CORIN PUNCHBALL THAT'S EXACTLY WOULDS HAPPENING FORTY FIVE HOUSE RE PUBLICANS INCLUDING SEVERAL POWER PLAYERS TO BRITTNA LETTER TO THE CONFERENCE EFFECTIVELY TO MANDING CHANGES THE MOTION TO VACATE RULE THAT COSTMC CARTHY HIS JOB A FEW MEMBERS WHO SIGND THE S LETTERS TAI THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO INDORSE ANYBODY FOR SPEAKER UNTIL THE MOTION O VACATE IS OVERHAULED THOSE NAMES INCLUDE REPRESENT OF SEPENY BICE VOKE LOHOLMA DUSTY JOHNSON OF SOUTH TO COTA REPRESENT BRINFIT'S PATRICK OF PENNSYLVANIA GHERI GRAVES OF LOUISIANA FOR AN AFFAIRS AT OMMITTEE CHAR MIHTE MC CAUL OF TEXAS AND WAYS AN MEANS COMITTE CHUR JASON SMITH O MISSOURI AGAINIS A BIG FACTION IT'S FORTY FIVE PEOPLE THERE'S EVEN SOME TALK TO MC CARTHY IGHT GET A SECON GO ROUND HERE ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT THAT IS VERY UNLIKELY AFT THIS POINT MEANWHILE THE QUESTION IS WETHER ANY OF THESE PEOPLE OTER CAN BE ABLE TO RAS LOT O MONEY STEEVESCOLESE HAS HE'S RAISED ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPPORT VARIOUS RE PUBLICANS OVER THE LAST DECADE SCLEES RAISED MORE IN LAST CYCLE FIFTY THREE MILLION THAN JORDEN RAISED OVER THE LAST DECATE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION SO THAT'S CAN BE A MAJOR CONCERN AGAIN BEING SPEAKER O THE HOUSE IS NOT THE SAME IS BEING I MOST IDEA LOGICALLY PURE USUALLY IT'S THE GICN CUT DEALS ND GET GET PEOPLE ELECTED BUT THIS IS A A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MASS WELL GET INTO MORE OF THAT MASSING

THAT BECOME WAL RIGHT CAS THRE'S A DEMOCRATIC SENETE AND A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND BOTH THOSE PEOPLE BOTH THOSE THOSE INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT WALLSDON'T DO THINGS SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND SO IF MACGATES ONCE O PUT FOR D A LIST  THE ACTUAL IKE CHIEVABLE THINGS THAT DON'T ACTIVELY DAMAGE THE RE PUBLICAN PARTYES ABILITY TO BE DEMOCRAKS I'M HAPPY TO HEAR IT I SAID THIS BEFORE WITH CHIPROY WAS DOING THIS AGAINS GEP MOCARTHY WHICH HE DID EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND THEN HE NAMES BUNCH CONCESSIONS I'M ALL IN FAVOR THAT THAT'S FINE BUT IF THESE CONCESSIONS ARE NON DUABLE CONCESSIONS THET DEMOCRATS TAKE AD MANAGE OF I'M NOTSUR HOW THAT EXACTLY IS A BIG WIN AND HOW IT'S NOT EXACTLY POSTURING AN GEN ALL THIS PUTS WHOEVER IS RUNNING FOR SPEAKER IN IN A PRETTY MAJOR JAM HERE BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE JIM JORDON HE HAS COME FOR ID AND HE SAYS WE'RE NOT GON TO GO TO A VOTE WITH OUT TO EIGHTEEN MI BREGIN TO NEED TWO EIGHTEEN IN ORDERO GO FOR D WITH AVOUT WHEN I'M AN HAVE VOTE ON THE SPEAKERIN TO HAVE ALREADYESIDE BEHIND CLOSE OR SUS SPEAKER IT HAS THE HAP WE SHOULDN'T GO TO THE HOUSEFORN TILL WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN VOTS FOR THE SPIKER OF THE ANITED STATES HOUSE TO RE PRESENTATIVES WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE DID BACK IN JANUARY I'M ALL FOR THAT I THINK I CAN BRING OUR TEEME TO GETHER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ONCE WE GET THAT DONE TO DO THE WORK THAT NE IT'S TO BE DONE ON THE BORDER ON CRIN ON AND PLATIN ON ALL THESE ISSUES WE HAVE TO ADDRESS I THINK I CAN DO THAT THAT'S WHY THE TATEDER UM  ME UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS IS THE BIG QUESTION UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS WHAT ACTUALL GET'S HAMMERED OUT HERE IS GOING TO FIND WHETHER THE OUSTROM MC CARTHY WAS GOOD OR BAD YET I SEMS LIKE TERE IS NO PLAN IN OUSTIN MAC CARTHY SO MAYBE DENS UP O K ANYWAY AVREADY SCRAMBLES NTHE ND OF COMING WITH SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT IF THAT THAT'S THE CASE THIN CREDIT TO GAT BUT IF IT DOESN'T END UP THAT WAY IF ITS JUST SUR CHAOS OR IF WE ANS UP BACK IN THE SAME SITUATION WITH AN INCREDIBLY WEAK SPEAKER UNABLE TO KEEP HIS OWN PEOPLE IN LINE THEN DEMOCRATES ARE GOING TO WIN BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU ARE RUNNING A CLOWN CAR PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS EVEN IF THEIR POLICIES ARE ABSOLUTE SHER GARBAGE THOUGH THE ONE GOOD PIECE OF NEWS YERE IS THE DONAL TRUMP WHOS SPECULATING JUST A A FEW MOMENTS TO GO ABOUT POSSIBLY RUNNING FOR SPEAKER HIMSELF ELYSIAS STOP THAT NONSENSE THAT THATS DUME I'M NOT EVEN SHUR WYT PEOPLE WERE CON SIDERING THAT THERES AN ACTIVE HOUSE RULE RIGHT NOW ON THE RE PUBLICANSIDE THAT IFYOURE UNDER AN ACTIVE INDIGHTMAN YOU CAN'T BE HOUSE SPEAKER A TRUMS UNDER MULTIPLE ACTIVE INDICHTMENTS RIGHT NOW THAT UT IF HAD CHANGED THE ROLD AN SUPER AWKWARD I KNO WHO THOUGHT THE TRUMP HAD THE SKILL SET TO BE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ANYWAY ITWOULD IN VERY STRANGE IM BUT DOME AT LEAST THAT'S OFF THE TABLE WHEN TRUMP INDORSE IS JORDAN SO  SO GOOD FOR TRUMP FOR ENDORSING SOMEBODY AT THIS POINT ONE THE WAYS CAN TELL THE JORDANIS GOOD CANDIDET IS HOW MUCH LIFT TATES HIM SUNNY HOSTON OF THE VIEW SHE SAYS THE JIM JORDAN IS A TERRORIST LITERALLY A TERRORIST WHY IS YO SHRAPPING DYNA MIGHT TO HIMSELF NOW HE WAS MEANR OR ONE TIME I WILL JUST SAY ABOUT GENJOIT AND YOU KNOW I HE HAS BEEN CALLED BY HIS OWN PARTY BY GIANT JOHN BANER A POLITICAL TERRORIST HE'S ALSO BEEN LINK TO THE OHIO SAT SEXTUAL THE BE SCANDAL I TESTIFI IN FRONT O CONGRESS ABOUT SOMETHING SO SEMPLE CAMERAS AND COURT RUMS HE CAME IN LATE HE LOOKD DE SEVLED AND HE IMMEDIATELY WAS SCREAMING AND YALLING AND TERRORIZED TO ME AND  BE OF THEIR EXPERTS ON THE PANEL AND DESCRIBING HIM AS A TERRORIS AS EXXACTLY THAT HE'S A CCAOS AGENT AND IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND HE HAD NO COMMAND OF THE SUBJECT THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHICH MADIT EVENSCARRIOU SO TO HAVE HA THE THOUGHT OF IM BEING THESPEAKER OF THE HOUSE I THINKEADS TO MORE CHAOS AT HIS WON MODEL AS TOMEL TRUMCL AS NO COMMAND OF THE LANGUAGE Y THAT O GAA JOY BAY HARD RIPPING PEOPLE FOR FOR LACT OF COMMAND OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ANS A WATCHING A DOG TRY TO EXPLAIN TO TO A HUMAN NO HOW LANGUAGE OUGHT TO WORK YOU'RE MOSTLY JUST AMAZE THE DOG CAN SPEAK ENGLISH OT THE MONLIC JO JOY  P YOU RIPPING PEOPLE FOR COMMAND THE EGLISH I MISH GOOD STUFF RIGHT THERE AGAIN THAT IS THE SINGLEBUS CASE FORAGE IM JORAN I'VE EARD NOW SHERE IS THE AWKWARD THING HERES THE AWKWARD THING WHATEVER DEAL GETS CUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING TO HALFTON NOW ACTUALLY RE ESTABLISH ITSELF AS A PARTY O SPENT THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RIPPING POWER AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE TOP OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT AS COME WITH A COUPLE OF BENEFITS AND SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CLOS THE BENEFITS ARE THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS GOTTEN MORE RIGHT WING OR LEAST IT DID BRIEFLY WHEN IT CAME TO FOR EXAMPLE SPENDING THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS TERRIFIC OUTS OF PART OF IT CALLD UN CONGRESS TO ACTUALLY PUSHBACK ON SPENDING THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND YOU SIMPLY DESTROY THEM AND YOU SAY THAT PETTY MUCH EVERYYOU CRETE A ROILING BOILING POT INSIDE FOR EXAMPLE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THEREPUBLICAN PARTY INFERSTRUCTRE HAS NO POWER TO ACTUALLY DICTATES WELL THAT POINT WHATE YU WENT UP WITH SENDLESSTO KET ANDLESS CAUS YET IT'S OF ON YOU RE PUBLICANS WILOOK AT NANCY POLOSY ON THE ONE HAND WITH THEEP IN ABITING HATRED FOR HER POLICY AND ON THE OTHER

YOU WANT TO FIGHT NANCY POLOSY WHICH REQUIRES NATURAL CONSOLIDATION OR POWER AROUND INSTITUTIONS WITH LEADERSHIP OR YOU WANTO ARGUE AMONGST YOURSELVES IN THE NAME OF PRINCIPLE ANDTHN LOSE TO POPLE LIKE NANCY POLOSY WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE GOIN TO HAVE TO BE SOME SORT OF TOOLS TAT ARE PUT IN THE HANDS OF THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP THAT ARE GOING TO A LOW PUNISHMENT FOR THE MEMBERS NOW RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND EVERY'S RUNNING FOR SPEAKER AND SO AT THE MOMENT IT'S GOINTO BE ALL OF THEM BASICALLY APPEALING TO THE ETTER ANGELS OF NATURE RITS O YOU HAVE JIM JORN OR EXAMPLE DEFENDING MACGATES FROM THE CALLS FOR EXPULSION HER'E BEEN SOME MEMBERS THE REPUBLICAN CAUCAS HAVE SAID T WHAT HE DID HEARE IS RIDICULOUS THAT SHOULD EXPELL HEM FROM THEC CAUCAS I DON'T THINK YOU EXPELL HEM FROM THE CAUCASWHEN

ANALYST ON THE SORT OF TUFF HE SAYS THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF OF AVOIDING A HARD LANDING HERE IS REALLY REALLY DECREASING PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY HE HAS A PIECE OVER THE FINANCIAL TIMES POINTING THIS OUT HE SAYS THE ECONOMY IS LIKELY WEAKEN AS MARKETS INTERNALIZE THE SIGNIFICANT LIKELIHOOD THAT RATE WILL STAY HIGHER FOR LONGER HE SAYS AN INTENSE PERIOD OF RISING INTERESTRATES HIGH OIL PRICES IN A STRONGER DOLLAR IS PUSHING THE FINANCIAL MARKET CONCENSES AN NUOS ECONOMIC GROWTH AWAY FROM THE COMFORTING NOTION OF SOFF LANDING BY MY COUNT IS ILBE THE SIXTH TIME IN THE PAST FIFTEEN MONDS THAY CON VENTIONAL WIS DOM SHIFTS FOR THE WORLD'S MOST INFLUENTIAL ECONOMY HAT TO PIVIT THAT UNFORTUNALELY IS LIKELY TO STICK FOR LONGER THIS TIME AROUND THREATENING WHAT HAS BEEN AN IMPRESSIVELY STRONGOSTS ECONOMY UNDERMINING GENUINE E FINANCIAL STABILITY AND EXPORTING VOLATILITY TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IN JUST THE LAST TWO WEEKS THE YIELD ON THE BENCH MARKET YOU AS TENOR BOND HAS RISEN BY SOME A ZERO POINT FIVE PRERSENTACE POINTS AROUND FOUR POINT EIGHT PER CENTS AS PART OF A COMPREHENDS OF SHIFT IN THE ENTIRE INTRESTRAT STRUCTURE THE MOVE BROUGHT THE CHANGING YIELDS TH AN I POPPING ONE PER CENTAGE POINTS SINCE THE END OF JUNE LEADING TO HIGHER BORROWING RATES FOR COMPANIES OR BURN SOME CARLONS FOR HOUSEHOLDS MORE PRONOUNC N ON EVEN TOE POSIT OUTFLOWS FROM THE BANKING SYSTEM AS IN VESTERS SHIFT CASH INTO MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS NOTABLY TE COST OF A THIRTYOR MORTGAGE IS UP TO EIGHT PER CENT MAKIN ALREADY EXSPENTSTIVE HOME PURCHASES EVEN LESS AFFORTABLE PUSHING YIELDS UP AND INCREASINGLY DISORDERLY MANNER IS A COMBINATION OF MARKETS RECOGNIZING THAT THE HIGHER POLSU RATE SED BY THE FAD WILL BE HERE FOR A WHILE AND THE NEED TO ABSORB A SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY OF TREASURY BONDS DO TO LARGE BUDGETARY DEPHISIT PLUSTER'S HIGH OIL PRICES THESE ARE DEVELOPMENTS THAT THE ECONOMY AND MARKETS DO NOT INE WAY THEY DAMP GROWTH THE INCREASE THE THREAT OF STAG FLATION AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE SERIOUS THREAT THERE'S A JOBS REPORT THAT A FIRST GLANCE LOOKS REALLY REALLY NICE A DROB'S REPORT IN SEPTEMBER THAT SHOWED THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND CHOBS ATED BUTT IF THE IDEA WAS THAT THE ECONOMY IS OVER HEATED AND WE SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY AND THAT THE ECONOMY IS TO BE COOLED THEN ADDING THREIN AN THIRTY SIX THOUSAND JOBS THAT'S A VERY HIGH RATE AND DOING THAT WITHOUT REALLY INCREASING THE LABOR FORSE PARTICIPATION RAGHT IN ANY SERIOUS WAY WHICH JUST MEANS THAT NOW TASICALLY THE SAME PERCENTAGE PEOPLE ARE IN THE LABOR FORSE WERE IN THE LABOR FORS BEFORE DU CONTINUING  THAT SORT OF THING IS NOT GOING TO LEAD THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO LOWER INTRESTRATES TOR CAN INCREASE INTRESTRATES AGAIN ACCORDING TO AB SY NEWS BEING A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC ATS POSSIBLE THE COOLING OF PAYGROWTH MAY HELP REASSURE THE FAS IN FLATION FIGHTERS WOR SCRUTINIZING EVERY SCRAP OF DATED TO DETERMINED WHETHER TO RASE THEIR CURATE AGAIN THIS YEAR STILL THE OUTSIDES JOB GROWTH MAY STOKE WARRIES THE ECONOMY WILLEXSPAND TWO FAST FROM FLATION TO COOL IF THEY THINK IF PEOPLE THINK BY THE WAY THAT THE RATES ARE GOINGTO GO UP ON BONDS FOR EXEMPLE WHAT IS THAT TO IT TRAPS THE BON YUELD UP THE PRICE ON THE BOND THAT WE HAVE ALREADY RELEASED IN THE MARKET IS GOING TO GO DOWN AS THOSE BOND YIELDS INCREASE THAT MEANS EVENTUALLY PEOPING IN A SHIFT THEIR MONEY OUT OF STOKSON INTO THESE VERY HIGH YIELD BONDS WHEN THEY DO THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS GOING TO STAGNATE ALREADY EARNINGS ARE THREATENED SO AGAIN WE ARE WE ARE IN A A REALLY TENTER HOOK SITUATION ON THE ECONOMY WHAT SHALL BY AN I THINK MIGHT BE WAITING FOR HERE FRANKLIES FOR REPUBLICANS TO SHUT TOWN THE GOVERNMENT HE'S THE SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT LEAST CAN BLAME HIS FAILING A CON MEAN SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT HIM IS JUST ANOTHER REASON WHY RE PUBLICANS NEED TO BE SMART AND STRACTEGIC ABOUT THIS SORT OF STUFF AS SUPPOSED TO GRAND STANDING AND AND CREATING A NEW SPEAKER WHO HAS NO POWER TO ACTUALLY CUDGELIS OWN MEMBERS IN A LINE BECAUSE WHAT'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS THE IDEA THT YOURE CNAPASS A PARTY LINE BUDGET WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO CUDGELANEAR OWN MEMBERS INTO LINE THAS CAN BE A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO PARTICULARLY INTHE FACE OF A DEMOCRATIC SENTETE AND MEANWHILE HILLERY CLINTON IN SHE JUST COMES OUT OF H WOULD RECOVERY SO OFFENTO TO REALLY RECK AMERICAN POLITICS FURTHER I DON'T KNOW WHY SHEIS STILL ON ON ITEVS BUT SHE IS SHE HAS NOW CALLED FOR THE FORMAL DEPROGRAMMING OF MAGAMEMBERS THEY'RE IN A CULT YOU SEE IF YOUR DEMOCRAT AND YOU CULTISHLY AND SLAVISHLY WORSHIP BROKAMAMA OR HILLERY CLINTON OR NOW IN ELDERLY DOTHARD WHO HAS THE INABILITY TO SPEAK FROM HIS FACEHOL THEN THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NORMAL BUT IF YOUR TRUMP FAN OR EVEN IF NOT A TRUM FAM BY VOTED FOR HIM THIS MEANS THAT YOU ARE A MAGAMEMBER WHO MUST BE DEPROGRAMMED AN WE HAD VERY STRONG PARTIZANS AND BOTH PARTIES IN TE PAST AH AND WE HAD VERY BITTER BATTLES OVER ALL KINDS OF THINGS GON CONTROL AND CLIMATE CHANGE AN THE ECONOMY AND TACES BUT THERE WASN'T THIS LITTLE TALEOD EXTREMEESS AN WAVING IU KNO WAGGING THE DOG OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS IT IS TO DAY AND SADLY SO MANY OF THOSE EXTREME SAYS MAGA EXTREMES AM TAKE THEIR MARCHING ORDERS FROM DONALD TROMP WHO HAS NO CREDABILITY LAUGHED BY ANY MAZURE HE'S ONLY IN IT FOR HIMSELF HE'S NOW DEFENDING HIMSELF AN CIVIL ACTIONS AND CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND WHEN DO THEY BREAK WITH HIM U NO BECAUS AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE NEDS TO BE A FORMAL DEP PROGRAMMING AT THE CULT MEMBERS BUT SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHAT DIS THAT MEAN OF FORMAL DEPROGRAMMING OF THE CALL MEMBERS IS AS NOWN FISHUSTICUETENS FICISTIC TO ME ME TONGO FUN ADULT CAMPS LIKE IOU MON STOCK ABOUT REEDUCATION CAMPSLIC WHAT WHAT WOULD FORMAL DEP PROGRAMMING EVEN LOOK LIKE FROM HILLERY CLINTON IN THIS THI SHOULD BE FRIGHTENING SHOULD BE PRITICARLY FRIGHTEN AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT ACCORDING TO NEWSWEEK THE FEDERAL GOERNMENT BELIEVES THE THREAT OF VIOLENE IN MAJOR CIVIL DISTURBANCE IS AROUND THE TWENTY TWENTY FORTY GOST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS SO GREAT AS QUIETLY CREATED A NEW CATEGORY OF EXTREMESTS IT SEEKS TO TRACK AND COUNTER DONL TRUMS ARMY OF MAGA FOLLOWERS THE F B I APPARENTLY I'S GOING TO PURSUE AND PREVENT WHAT CALLS DOMESTIC TERRORISM WITHOUT RECT REFERENCE TO POLITICAL PARTIES OR AFFILIATIONS BUT TITHAS MAJORITY OF ITS CURRNT ANTI GOVERNMEN INVESTIGATIONS ARE OF TRUM SUPPORTERS ACCORDING TO CLASSIFIED DET OBTAIN BY NEWSWEEK A CURRENT AT THE I OFFICIAL SAYS THE EFBIZ AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION THE EF THEIS INTEND ON STOPPING DIMESTIC TERRORISM AND ANY REAPIT OF JANUARY SIX BUTT THER FOCUSING ON FORMER PRESED EN TRUMP AND HIS MAGO SUPPORTERS IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOW NEWSWEEK SPOKE TO OVER A CURRENT A DOZN CURRENTS OR FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SPECIALIZING IN TERRORSMEN OF HREE MONTH INVESTIGATION TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT DOMESTIC SCURITY LANDS SCAPE AND TO A VALUE IT OF BIDING IS DOING ABOUT WHAT CALLS AT DOMESTIC AT TERRORISM ANDTA THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SECRET F PI AND D A CHSTATA TRACKING INCID IN'S TVEST INVESTIGATIONS IN CASES IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY ARE CRACKING DOWN ON MAGOT MEMBERS PRESUMABLY AT THE BEHASTO PRESEN ABIDN WHO TEETED AT LAST SUPTEMBER DONAL TRUMPAND MAG REPUBLICANS ARE THREATS THE VERY SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY SO THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE WHO OPPOSET OR BIDAN NEE DE PROGRAMMING THE F BA NEANS TO TARGET THEM ALL THAT SHOULD SCARE IT THE LIVING HELL OUT OF YOU AN IS NOT JUST BY THE WAY THAT THEY ARE TARGANING THE COMMON DOWN A TROM VOTER THERE ALSO TARGANING ANYBODY 'S JUST HETERODOX THE BIN ADMINISTRATION MEANWHILE CONTINUES TO TARGET YULON MUSK HOW MANY AGENCIES AUR TARGANG ELON MUSKOF THIS POINT WE GOT THE THAT THE C  C WHICH HAS TARGAN THAT THE F T C WHICH IS TARGANING HIM THAT THE ANALAR BE I BELIEVE IS TARGANING HIM IT IS LIKE EVERY AGENCY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMEN IS NOW TARGANIUM THIS WEARD WHY IS THAT HAPPENING I CAN'T IMAGINE OTHER THAN THAT HE HAS HETERODOX'S POLITICAL OPINIONS THE C C SAID THURSDAY IT IS SEEKING ANOTHER COURT ORDER THEY WOULD COMPELLE YOUON MUST TO TEST FIGHT IS PART OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS PURCHASE OF TWITTER NOW CALLED ACTS THE C C SAID IN A FILING IN A SAN FRANCISCO FEDERAL COURT MUST FAILED TO APPEAR FOR TESTIMONY ON SUPTEMB OR FIFTEENTH DESPITE AN INVESTIGATE IF SEPINA SERVED BY THE C C AND HAVING RAISEONA OBJECTIONS OF THE TIME IT WAS SERVED BUT TWO DAYS BEFORE SCEDRAL TESTIMONY MUST ABRUPTLY NOTIFY THE  C C STAFF HE WOULD NOT APPEAR THE C C SAID HAS BEEN CONDUCTING A FACT FINDING INVESTIGATION VOLVING THE PERIOD BEFORE MUSKS TAKE OVER LAST YEAR WHEN TWITER WAS STILL PUBLICLY TRADED THE AGENTS HE SAID IT HAS NOT CONCLUDED THAT ANY ONE VIOLATED FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS THERE JUST INVESTIGATING YOT FOR THE FUN OF IT AND FOR THE HELL OF IT BY THE WAY IT'S IT'S WHY WOULD YOU INVESTIGATE ELON MUSK FOR BUYING TWITTER AND TURNING IT INTO ACTS BY PRETTY MUCH EVERY VAILABLE COUNT HE HAS LOST TENS OF BILLIONS OFDOLLARS IN THAT TRANS ACTIONS SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE HORRIBLE THING THAT HE DID WHEN HE TOOK THE HIT THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS THAT PUT PRESSURE ON MUSKEN AND HOPE TO SHUT IM UP IT IS THE BASIC IDEA TILDRY CLINTON OF COURSE SPELLS THAT ONE OUT ONCE AGAIN SHE SAYS YOU KNOW WE NEED HES BIG PLATFORMS TO DO WHAT HILLERY CLITTON WANTS THEM TO DO PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIHE ARE MOUNTING A MASSIVE A RESISTANCE TO ATOCRACY A TO THE OPPRESSION OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TO IRRESPONSIBLE BIG TAC COMPANIES WHOSE PLATFORMS ARE ABSOLUTELY RIT WITH MASOGANY AND SECISEM AND BIRAL ATTACKS ON WOMEN IN THE PUBLIC SPER SO WE ARE TRYING TO TELL A DIFFERENT STORY A A DIFFERENT NARATIVE FOR THE FUTURE BY NOT ONLY STANDING UP FOR DEMOC HUMAN RHTS AND PROGRESS BUT HIGHLIGHTING A WOMEN WHO ARE DOING IT IN THEIR LIES EVERY SINGLE DAY SUCHS THE BIG PLATFORMS THAT AR TOBLAME OBVIOUSLY SAYS HILLERY CLINTON WE WE ALL KNOW WHICH PLATFORMS SHE IS TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE SO TELON MUST TWEATED OUT A COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL THE ANCIES AS SORELHY NEEDED ALONG WITH HA COMMISTION TO TAKE PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHOE ABUSE THAIR REGULATORY POWER FOR PERSONAL AND POLITICAL GAN CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN HE SAYS THE PROBABILITY OF IT HAPPENINGS A HUNDRED PERCENT WHLE WE CAN ONLY HOPE AND PRAY THAT THAT IS TRUE BECAUSE THE THREATS AGAINST MUSCAR HAVE BEEN PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY I'L CA MEANWHILE IT'S TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AND SOME THINGS

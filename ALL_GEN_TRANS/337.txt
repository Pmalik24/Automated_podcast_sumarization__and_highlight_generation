EQUALS FUN WHICH EVEN RHYN KNOWS IS AN EXACTLY TRUE BECAUSE ONE THING I HAVEN'T MENTIONE YET AND PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE IS THER RHYAN DOESN'T DRINK AT LEAST NOT ANY MORE OW IS MOLLOM AS YN OIN OI N I HE  HAVES O MO NOT LITTL  LIN SA GOIN ALIM NOIN N O NIMS O TIM BE YON NOT A O ONE A B M TENDER GOD IN A EN DO ONE BEN ROUN TO WIT TASTY MOGERIDA WO TAK WHERV TE  HART OF RHYAN BACK IS WRIDING NEW LYRICS TO EXISTING ROCKSWOS IT DESCRIBED THE PLEASURES OF DRINKING CUERVOL OR GIVE VERY PRECISE DIRECTIONS ON HAD TO DO A BODY SHOT HERE'S AN EXAMPLE  SHOTS WITH HER WITHOUT TRAINING WHEELS QUERVO DOESN'T HURT YOU KNOW IT HEELS IT'S A LITTLE UNNERVING TO HEAR KNOWING THAT THE PERSON WHO WROTE THESE LERICS AS THE SAME PERSON WHO QUIT DRINKING MORE THAN A YEAR AGO IN PART BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT KILL HIM HE WAS KICKED OUT OF A HOTEL IN FLORIDA FOR THROWING A TABLE OFF THE BALCONY IN SAINE LOUISY BLACKED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PROMOTION AND A QUERVONATION HE GOT SO LOADED HE CURSED OUT AN ELDERLY GUEST HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERTAINING IRWAS IT AN OLDER GUY PROBABLY NA SIXTIES AND THEY WERE LIKE PROFESSIONAL CONTEST WINNERS AND HE'ST TALKING AT DINNER ABOUT LIKE ALL THESE OTHER CONTESTS HE WANE AND HOW LIKE THIS ONE WAS NICER THAN THIS ONE AND AN BOVIN IT SOUND LIKE HE IS COMPLAINING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOMETHING AND I WAS LIKE WHAN'T YOU SHUT UP 'S A FREE FRECKIN TRAP OLD MAN O KAY WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR PROFESSIONAL CONTEST WINNIN ATTITUDE TO SHOVE IT UP YOUR AND THE NEXT DAY I WOLL CUPLIK I KNOW I SAYS SOMETHIN OL  THE PROBLEM FOR RHYOAN WAS THAT IN MOST CASES THAT IS VERY BAD TO BE CAUGHT DRINKING ON THE JOBS BUT IN RHYAN'S CASE IT ONLY MADE A MORE SUCCESSFUL THE WILDER AND DRUNKER HE GOT THE MORE BARS WANTED HIM BACK THE MORE QUERVA ONE AM BACK AND WHAT AMAZES ME IS THAT AT THE TIME RHYAN WAS DECIDING TO GET SOBER QUERVO ASKED HIM TO SIGN ON FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED PROMOTIONAL GIGS OVER THE COURSE OF THE COMING YEAR AND RYAN SAID OW ABOUT ONE FIFTY THAT'S EVERY WEE CANT ALMOST HALF THE YEAR SPENT IN BARS TO KEELA ON HIS HEAD TO KEEL A SPILLING DOWN HIS FACE IT MUST BE LIKE EVE WORKING IN THE APPLE FACTORY IN ITS OWND BY SNAKES HOW DOES IT FEEL AS SOMEONE WO DOZEN DRINK ANY MORE TO BE CONFRONT ED ON A NIGHTLY BASIS WITH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE THE DRUNK AND HURTING FORMER YOU UM I JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT ALL THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT EITHER WAY AND I JUST DON'T KNOW  THINK THAT'S IT I M I CAN'T MAKE ANY JUDGMENT I MEANS IS NOBODY THAT I COULD TELL YOU LIKE THAT GY NEEDS TO STOP DRINKING AND KNOW IT FOR SHURE I CAN CERTAINLY SAY LIGOI GI REMINDS ME OF ME AN O THAT THAT HAPPENS A LOT IM BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO I JUST NOW IT'S UP TO THEM AGIS IT'S NOT MY CALL RHYANS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAY BARHOT FOR QUERVA IS

AROUND IN PUBLIC COSTING PEOPLE YELLING AT THEM CONVINCING THEM OF THE SUPERIORITY OF THIS PARTICULAR BRANDIF SHAVER BY HOPPING INTO FOUNTAINS AND GETTING SPRAL OHE SHY  BUT IF IT SOUNDS AS IF THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE THINK OF THIS FIRST PEOPLE DO NOT GENERALLY DRINK WHILE THEY'RE SHAVING AND SECOND RHYN'S AN ACTOR NOW AN ACTUAL ACTOR WITH NATIONAL EXPOSURE A GOOD AGENT MAKING DECENT MONEY SO THE BACK

ABOUT FRANKSNOTR SENIOR AND THE FAMILY AND SO FORTH I DID NOT THINK THAT HE WOULD LET HIS WIFE KNOW IF HE THOUGHT THE KIDNAPPING WAS GOING TO BE RESOLVED IN A MATTER OF A FEW HOURS I WONDER IF THE FACT THAT YOU CONSTRUCTED SUCH AN ELABORATE WEB OF LOJECT WITH OUT YOUR BUSINESS PLAN THAT THAT MADE THE KIDNOPPING SEEMED SO REASONABLE AND EVEN GOOD FOR THE SANATRES I WONDER IF THAT PREVENTED YOU

BECOME UNCOMFORTABLE THEN THEY WOULD STOP ASKING ME ANY THIG AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE HARD THING ABOUT WORKING AT THE GAZETTE WAS THAT THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH REJECTION EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE CALLING ALMOST TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE A DAY NINETY EIGHT PERCEND OF WHO WANTED TO SEE YOU DEAD YOU STILL HAD TO BRING A CERTAIN HOPEFULNESS TO EACH CALL A FEELING THAT THIS ONE THE CALL YOU WERE MAKING RIGHT NOW COULD BE THE ONE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE TRYING TO HYPNOTIZE YOURSELF AND TO BELIEVING THAT SOMETHING A CERTAIN TO SAY RAVITY DIDN'T EXIST AND THE NEXT TIME YOU DROP THE APPLE IT WON'T FALL TO THE GROUND

THE CHAOS OF THE PITCHING ROOM BUT TO TRY AND IMAGINE WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS HEAD AND AT THE SAME TIME I TRIED TO REMEMBER WHAT WEN THROUGH MY OWN HEAD DURING THOSE PAUSES IT WAS ALWAYS SORT OF

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN AOSCIENCE SCIENCEPACETO  I MAN DREW HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR SAM HARRIS DOCTOR SAM HARRIS DID HIS UNDERGRADUATE TRAINING IN PHILOSOPHY AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY AND THEN WENT ON TO DO HIS DOCTRITE IN NEURO SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSY OF CALIFORNIA LOST ANGELIS HE IS WELL KNOWN AS AN AUTHOR WHO HAS WRITTEN ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM MEDITATION TO CONSCIOUSNESS FREE WILL AND HE HOLDS MANY STRONG POLITICAL VIEWS THAT HE'S VOICED ON SOCIAL MEDIA END IN THE CONTENT OF VARIOUS BOOKS AS THEY RELATE TO PHILOSOPHY AND NEURO SCIENCE DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE I MAINLY TALK TO DOCTOR HARRIS ABOUT HIS VIEWS AND PRACTICES RELATED TO MEDITATION CONSCIOUSNESS AND FREE WILL IN FACT HE MADE SEVERAL IMPORTANT POINTE ABOUT WHAT A PROPER MEDITATION PRACTIUS CAN ACCOMPLISH PRIOR TO THIS EPISODE I THOUGHT THAT MEDITATION WAS ABOUT DELIBERATELY CHANGING ONE'S CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THINGS SUCH AS DEEPER RELAXATION A HEIGHTENED SENSE OF FOCUS OR ABILITY TO FOCUS GENERALLY ELEVATED MEMORY AND SO ON WHAT SAM TAUGHT ME IN WHAT YOU'LL SOON LEARN AS WELL IS THAT WHILE MEDITATION DOES INDEED HOLD ALL OF THOSE VALUABLE BENEFITS THE MAIN VALUE OF A MEDITATION PRACTICE WERE PERHAPS THE GREATER VALUE OF A MEDITATION PRACTICE IS THAT IT DOES IN JUST ALLOW ONE TO CHANGE THEIR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE BUT IT ACTUALLY CAN ALLOW A HUMAN BEING TO VIEW CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROCESS OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS AND IN DOING SO TO PROFOUNDLY SHIFT THE WAY THAT ONE ENGAGES WITH THE WORLD AND WITH ONE'S SELF IN ALL PRACTICES ALL ENVIRONMENTS AND AT ALL TIMES BOTH IN SLEEP AND IN WAKING STATES AND IN THAT WAY MAKING MEDITATION PERHAPS VEMOST POTENT AND IMPORTANT PORTAL BY WHICH ONE CAN ACCESS NOVEL WAYS OF THINKING AND BEING AND VIEWING ONE'S LIFE EXPERIENCE WE ALSO DISCUSS THE SO CALLED MIND BODY PROBLEM AND ISSUES OF DUALITY AND FREE WILL CONCEPTS FROM PHILOSOPHY IN NARROW SCIENCE THAT FORTUNALELY THANKS TO VALUABLE EXPERMENTS AND DEEP THINKING ON THE PART OF PEOPLE LIKE DOCTOR SAM HARRIS AND OTHERS IS NOW LEADING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND REALLY WHAT FREE WILL IS AND ISN'T WERE THE LOCUS OF FREE WILL LIKELY SITS IN THE BRAIN IF IT INDEED RESIDES IN THE BRAIN AT ALL AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CONSCIOUS BEING AND HOW WE CAN MODIFY OUR CONSCIOUS STATES IN WAYS THAT ALLOW US TO BE MORE FUNCTIONAL WE ALSO DISCUSS PERCEPTION BOTH VISUAL PERCEPTION AUDITORY PERCEPTION AND ESPECIALLY INTERESTING TO MEAN I THINK AS WELL HOPFULLY TO YOU TIME PERCEPTION WHICH WE KNOW IS VERY ELASTIC IN THE BRAIN THE LITERAL FRAME RATE BY WHICH WE PROCESS OUR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE CAN EXPAND AND CONTRACT DRAMATICALLY DEPENDING ON OUR STATE OF MIND AND HOW CONSCIOUS WE ARE ABOUT OUR STATE OF MIND SO WE WENT DEEP INTO THAT TOPIC AS WELL TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WAS INDEED AN INTELLECTUAL L DEEP DIVE INTO ALL THE TOPICS THAT I MENTION FEW MOMENTS AGO BUT IT ALSO INCLUDED MANY PRACTICAL TOOLS IN FACT I PUSHED SAM TO SHARE WITH US WHAT HIS SPECIFIC PRACTICES ARE AND HOW WE CAN ALL ARRIVE AT A CLEAR AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF A MEDITATION PRACTICE THAT WE CAN EACH IN ALL APPLY SO THAT WE CAN DERIVE THESE I CREDIBLE BENEFITS NOT JUST THE ONCE RELATED TO STRESS AND FOCUS AND INHANCED MEMORY BUT THE ONES THAT RELATE TO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS TO OUR DEEPER SENSE OF SELF AND TO OTHERS SEVERAL TIMES DURING TODAY'S EPISODE I MENTION THE WAKING UP AP THE WAKING UP AP WAS DEVELOPED BY SAM HARRIS BUT I WANT T EMPHASIZE THAT MY MENTION OF THE AP IS IN NO WAY A PAID PROMOTIONAL RATHER THE WAKING UP AP IS ONE THAT I'VE USED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME NOW AND FINE VERY VERY USEFUL I FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ALSO USE IT OTHER STAFF MEMBERS HERE THE HUBERMNLABPODCAST USE IT BECAUSE WE FIND IT TO BE SUCH A POWERFUL TOOL SAM HAS GENEROUSLY OFFERED HUBERMAN LABPOD CASTS LISTENERS A THIRTY DAY COMPLETELY FREE TRIAL OF THE WAKING UP AP IF ANY OF YOU WANT TO TRY IT YOU CAN SIMPLY GO TO WAKING UP DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THAT THIRTY DAY FREE TRIAL DURING TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WE DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT MEDITATION CONSCIOUSNESS AND FREE WILL WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT PSYCHODELICS BOTH THEIR THERAPUTIC APPLICATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF THINGS LIKE DEPRESSION AND PT ST BUT ALSO THE USE OF PSYCHODELICS AND WE DISCUSS SAM'S EXPERIENCES WITH PSYCHODELICS AS THEY RELATE TO EXPANDING ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS I ALSO ASK SAM ABOUT HIS VIEWS AND PRACTICES RELATED TO SOCIAL MEDIA PROMPTED IN NO SMALL PART BY HIS RECENT VOLUNTARY DECISION TO CLOSE DOWN HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT S WE TALKED ABOUT HIS RASIONAL FOR DOING THAT HOW HE FEELS ABOUT DOING THAT AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT TO BE VERY INTERESTING AS WELL BEFORE YOU BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE SELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHOSITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCES ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TO ELECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAHM OF SODIUM TWO UNDER MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KINOFPHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT H DOC COM SLASH HUBERMAN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PAC WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEMENTY DOTCOM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION BUT DOCTOR SAM HARRIS DOCTOR SAM HARRIS I JUST TALKING OT  HIS OOR YOU ARE INDEED A DOCTOR II CANNOT SAVE YOUR LIFE BUT I I MIGHT I MIGHT THAT I MIGHT SAY OF YOUR NOT EXISTENT SO IF WE TALK LONG ENOUGHWELL NEITHER OF US ARE CLINATIONS BUT WE ARE BOTH A BRAIN EXPLORERS FROM THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES SOME OVERLAPPING YE AND I'M REALLY SADH TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO YOUR VOICE FOR MANY YEARS LEARNING FROM YOU FOR MANY YEARS AND I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT MY FATHER WHOIS ALSO A SCIENTIST IS AN ENORMOUS FAN OF YOUR WAKING UP AP I AND HAS SPEND A LOT OF TIME OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS A HE'S IN HIS LATE SEVENTY SEES ALMOST EIGHTY THE THEORETICAL PHYSICIST WALKING TO THE PARK NEAR HIS APARTMENT AND SPENDING TIME MEDITATING WITH THE AP OR SOMETIMES SEPARATE FROM THE AT BUT USING THE SAME SORTS OF MEDITATIONS IN HIS HEAD YE CANTOGGLES BACK AND FORTH AND EVEN A I SHOULD SAY EVEN BUT YES EVEN IN HIS LATE SEVENTIES HIS REPORTED THAT IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY SHIFTED HIS AWARENESS OF SELF ND HIS CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE OF THINGS HAPPENING IN AND AROUND HIM AND HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO I THINK ALREADY SAW IM SELF AS APRETTY AWARE PERSON THINKING BOUT E YOU KNOW QANTO MECHANICS AND AND AND THE REST SO  THANK YOU FROM HIM INDIRECTLY I THANK YOU FROM ME A NOW DIRECTLY AND I REALLY ONE HE IS AT AS A WAY TO FRAME UP WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING QUESTIONS AND A NOT JUS SCIENCE OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY BUT ALL OF LIFE WHICH IS WHAT IS THIS THING THAT WE CALL ASELF IN AS FAR AS I KNOW WE HAVE NOT LOCALIZES THE REGION IN THE BRAIN THAT CAN ENTIRELY ACCOUNT FOR PERCEPTION F SELF THERE AIR IS OF COURSE IT REGULATE PROPRIERCEPTION YOU KNRE WHEREIN US OF WHERE OUR LIMBS ARE IN SPACE MAYBE EVEN ARE WERE IN US OF WHERE WE ARE IN PHYSICAL SPACE THERE ARE SUCH CIRCUITS AS WE BOTH KNOW EBUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SENSE OF SELF I HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS KIND OF A NERRO SCIENCE ONE OR ONE OM THING THAT WE ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TEACH MEMORY YOU SAY YOU KMEW WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND YOU REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE MOST PEOPLE DO EVEN IF THEY LACK MEMORY SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN FOR WHATEVER REASON PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT THAT WHOLE THING IS ABOUT HIM DO WE COME INTO THE WORLD FEELING THAT WAY I WOULD APPRECIATE ANSWERS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ANY FEELD YEOR SCIENCE OF GI WILL BIG QUESTION I THE PROBLEMAS WE WE USE THE TERM SELF IN SOE MAY DIFFERENT WAYS RIGHT  AND THERE'S WHAT THERE'S ONE SENSE OF THAT TERM WHICH I IS THE TARGET OF MEDITATION AS THE TARGET OF DECONSTRUCTION BY THE PRACTISE AND BY NDERSTANY SURROUNDING PHILOSOPHY SO YE YOU'LL HEAR AND YOU HEAR T FOR ME THAT THIS SELF IS AN ILLUSION RIGHT AND AND THAT THERES THIES A PSYCHOLOGICAL FREEDOM THAT CAN BE EXPERIENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF DISCOVERING IT TO BE AN ILLUSION I AND SOME PEOPLE ON'T LIKE THAT FRAMING OF PEOPLE WOULD WOULD INSIST THAT IS NOT SO MUCH N AN ILLUSION BUT IS A A CONSTRUCT AND IS NOT AT WHAT IT SEEMS RIGHT I BUT IT'S NOT THAT EVERY USE OF THE TERMSELF IS ILLEGITIMATE AND THERE'S CERTAIN TYPES OF SELVES THAT ARE NOT ILLUSORY  M YOU NON NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE ARE ILLUSIONS I MUST SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T I I TALK ABOUT YOUR SELF AS DISTINCT YOURSELF AS AS THATH WHOLE PERSON AND AND YOU KNOW IT WITH AS YO PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTINUITY WITH YOUR PAST EXPERIENCE IAS BEING DISTINCT FROM THE PERSON AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTINUITY OF SOME OTHER PERSON RINING OP  OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CONSERVE THOSE DATA IT'S NOT FUNDAMENTALLY MYSTERIOUS THAT YOU'REGING TO WAKE UP TO MORROW MORNING STILL BEING PSYCHOLOGICALLY CONTINUOUS WITH YOUR PAST AND NOT MY PAST RIGHT AN AND YOU KNW IF WE SWAPPED LIVES YOU KNOW THAT WOULD ITDOUNO DEMAND SOME EXPLANATION A SO THE ILLUSERINNESS OF THE SELF DOESN'T CUT AGAINST ANY OF THOSE OBVIOUS FACT SO THAT THE SENSE OF SELF THAT IS ILLUSORY A AND AGAIN WE MIGHT ONE T TALK OF A SELF AND OTHER MODES BECAUSE THERE'S  IJUST A LOT OF INTEREST THEYR PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND YOU N ULTIMATELY I SCIENTIFICALLY I THE THE THING THAT DOESN'T EXIST ICERTAINLY DOESN'T EXIST AS IT SEEMS AND I WOULD I WOULD WONT ARGUE THAT IT ACTUALLY IS JUST A PROPER ILLUSION I IS THIS THE SENSE THAT THERE IS A SUBJECT INTERIOR TO EXPERIENCE IN ADDITION TO EXPERIENCE O MOST PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEYRE HAVING AN EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD AND THERE HAVING THERE ANEXPERIENCE OF THEIR BODIIS IN THE WORLD AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE A SUBJECT INTERNAL TO THE BODY YOU ARE VERY LIKELY IN THE HEAD MOST PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEIR BEHIND THEIR FACE AS A KIND OF LOCUS OF AWARENESS AND THOUGHT AND INTENTION AND AND THAT EVER IS IT'S ALMOST LIK THEI YOUR PASSENGER INSIDE YOUR BODY YOU DON'T MOST PEOPLE DON'T FEEL IDENTICAL TO THEIR BODIES AND THEY CAN IMAGIN THIS THIS IS SO THE ORIGIN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ORIGIN AND OU THE THE FOLK PSYCHOLOGICAL ORIGIN OF OF A SENSE OF THAT THERE'STHAT TERE MIGHT BE A SOUL THAT TO SUR SURVIVE THE DEATH OF THE BODY MAN MOST PEOPLE ARE ARE WHAT MY FRIEND PAUL BLOOM CALLS COMMON SENSE DUALISTS RIGHT YOU YOU YOU'RE USED TO THE DE DEFAULT EXPECTATION SEEMS TO BE THAT WHATEVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MIND AND THE BODY THERE IS THIS THERE'S SOME PROMISE OF SEPARABILITY THEY ARE RIGHT THAT THE AND WHENEVER YOU YIT REALLY PUSH HARD ON THE SCIENCE SIDES THEY WILL KNOWN THAT THE MIND IS REALLY JUST WHAT THE BRAIN IS DOING THAT BEGINS TO FEEL MORE AND MORE COUNTER INTUITIVE TO PEOPLE AND THERE STILL SEEMS SOME SOME RESIDUAL MI STERY THAT YOU KNOW AT DEATH MAYBE SOMETHING HAS GOIN TO LIFT OFF THE BRAIN AND GO ELSEWHERE IGHT SO THE'S THE SENSE OF DUALISM  THAT MET MANY PEOPLE HAVE AND OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT'S SUPPORTED BY MANY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS A BUT THIS FEELING ITS ITIS A VERY PECULIAR STARTING POINT PEOPLE FEEL THAT IN IN THY DON'T FEEL LIK TENTICAL TO THEIR EXPERIENCE RIGHT IS A MATTER OF EXPERIENCE THEY FEEL LIKE THERE ON THE EDGE OF EXPERIENCE SOMEHOW APPROPRIATING IT FROM THE SIDE YOU KIND UPON THE EDGE OF THE WORLD AND THE WORLD IS OUT THERE YOUR BODY IS I IS IN SOME SENSE AN OBJECT IN THE WORLD A WHICH YOU YOU KNOW YOU IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD YOU KNOW THAT YTHE BOUNDARY OF YOUR SKIN ISTILL MEANING FUL YOU CAN SORT OF YOU LOOSELY CONTROL YOUR BODY AM YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOU CAN CON CONTROL YOUR GROSST YOUAND AND SUBTLE IN A VOLUNTARY MOTOR MOVEMENTS BUT A YOU CAN'T YOU'RE NOT CONTROLLING EVERYTHING YOUR BODY'S DOING YOU'RE OT CONTROLLING YOUR HEART BEAT AND YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR AM HORMONAL SECRETIONS AND ALL THAT AN SO THERE'S THE LOT THAT'S GOING ON THAT IS IN THE DARK FOR YOU AND THEN YOU  YOU GIVE SOME ONE IN INSTRUCTION TO MEDITATE SAY AND YOU SAY KEAE LESS LESS EXAMINE ALL THIS FROM THE FIRST PIRSON SCILIST LOOK FOR THIS THAYING YOU'RE CALLING I AND AGAIN EYE IS NOT IDENTICAL TO THE BODY PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEIR HANDS ARE OUT THERE AND THEY'RE WHEN THEY THEY GON TO MEDITATE THAT ON TO CLOSE THEIR EYES VERY LIKELY AN NOTHINGON TO PAY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING AND PANTAGE OF THE BREATH OR A SOUND AND IT'S FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF BEING A LOCUS OF ATTENTION THAT IS NOW AIMING ATTENTION STRATEGICALLY AT AN OBJECT LIKE THE BREATH A THAT THERE'S THIS DUALISM THAT IS SET UP AND ULTIMATELY THE ULTIMATE PROMISE OF MEDITATION AND THEREREALLY TOO LEVELS AT WHICH YOUE COULD BE INTERESTED IN MEDITATION AM ONE IS YOU KNOW VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND REMEDIAL AND NON PARADOXICAL AND VERY WELL SUBSCRIBED AND IT'S IT'S THE USUAL SET OF CLAIMS ABOUT ALL THE BENEFITS YOU'REGIN TO GET FOR MEDITATION RECALY YO CAN A LOWER YOUR STRESS AND YOU IN TO INCREASE YOUR FOCUS AND YOU'RE GOING T YOU KNOW STAVE OFF CORTICAL THINNING AND OTHER'S ALL KINDS OF GOOD THINGS THAT SCIENCE AS SAYING MEDITATION WILL WILL GIVE YOU AMAND NONE OF THAT ENTAILS REALLY DRILLING DOWN ON THIS PARADOXICAL CLAIM THAT THE SELF IS AN ILLUSION OR OR ANYTHING ELSE OF THAT SORT BUT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THE REAL PURPOSE OF MEDITATION AND IT'S REAL PROMISE IS NOT IN THIS LONG LIST OF OF BENEFITS IN ON NOT DISCOUNTING ANY OF THOSE THOUGH IN THE SCIENCE FOR MANY THEM I'S QUITE PROVISIONAL AM IT'S IN THIS DEEPER CLAIM THAT IF YOU LOOK FOR THIS THING YOU'RE CALLING EYE IF YOU LOOK FOR THE SENSE ATHERE'S A THINKER IN ADDITION TO THE THE THE MERE RISING OF THE NEXT THOUGHT SAY YOU WON'T FIND THAT THING AND AND YOU CAN WHAT'S MORE YOU CAN NOT FIND IT IN A W AY THAT'S CONCLUSIVE IAND THAT MATTERS RIGHT   AN AN HAS A THERE'S A HOST OF BENEFITS THAT FOLLOW FROM THAT DISCOVERY IM WHICH ARE I QUITE A BA DEEPER AND MORE INTERESTING THAN ENGAGING MEDITATION ON THE SIDE OF ITS BENEFITING  DISTRESSING INCREASING FOCUS AND ALL THE REST I'VE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RELATED HEARD WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND A FIRST OF ALL I I AGREE THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT MEDITATION CAN IMPROVE FOCAS RE DOSTRESS ET CETERA IT'S THERE IT'S AM NOT AN ENORMOUS PILE OF EVIDENTS BUT IT'S GROWING AND I THINK OF IT ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF THE SHORTER MEDITATIONS WHICH I THESE DAYS VIEW MORE AS PERCEPTIONAL EXERCISES YOU KNOW A TALKED BOUT THE SUN THE PICAST BEFORE BUT FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T HEARD O BEFORE ABOUT O PERCEPTION YOU CAN HAVE EXTRRECEPTION EXTENDING THINGS BEYOND THE CONFINEZIER SKIN INTERRECEPTION WHICH IS  ALSO INCLUDES THE SURFACES OF THE SKIN BUT EVERYTHING INWARD AM AND MEDITATION THROUGH EYES CLOSE TYPICALLY AM INVOLVING SOME SORT OF A ATTENTIONAL SPOT LIGHTING SOMETHING WILL GET INTO A TO MORE INTERRECEPTIVE VOR S AS EXTRAACEPTIVE EVENTS ET CETERA INCLUDING THOUGHTS AN SO I THINK OF AT IT AT A BASIC LEVEL MEDITATION AS A SOMEWHAT OF A PERCEPTIOAL EXERCISE AM YOU CAN TELL ME WHERE YOU DISAGREE THERE NIGHT I WOULD EXPECT AND HOPE THAT YOU COULD AM BUT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TOUCH ON THIS IDEA THAT YOU BROUGHT UP CONSICIAN INTERESTING ONE OF THIS IDEA THAT OUR BODIES ARE  CONTAINERS AND THAT WER AM SOMEHOW OF YOU OURSELVES AS PASSENGERS WITHIN THOSE CONTAINERS THAT CERTAINLY BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AM AND THE IMAGE THAT I HAVE IS OF I AS YOU SAY THAT IS OF MYSELF OR OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT SIT A FEW SENTIMETERS BELOW THE SURFACE OR THAT SIT ENTIRELY IN THEIR HEAD AND OF COURSE THE BRAIN AN BODY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I THINK SOMETIMES A BRAIN A IS USED TO REPLACE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT CAN GET US INTO TROUBLE JUS OF COMING UP WITH REAL REAL DIRECTIONS IN DEFINITIONS BUT THE POINT IS AT THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE REAL ESTATE IN THE HEAD I THINK FOR AS MUCH AS MY LABORATORY AND MANY OTHER SCIENTISTS ARE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN BRAIN BODY CONNECTIONS THROUGH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AN OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BINDS THAT IF YOU CODCUT OFF ALL MY LIMBS I'M GOING TO BE DIFFERENT BUT I'M FUNDAMENTALLY STILL ANDREW WHEREAS IR WE WERE TO LEISION A  A COUPLE SQUARE MILLIMETERS OUT OF MY PARATAL QUARTEKS AM IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD STILL SEEM AS MUCH LIKE ANDREW O TO OTHER PEOPLE INTO MYSELF THEEVEN AND SO THERE IS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THE REAL ESTATE IN THE CRANIAL VAULT AI WE OREN'T REMOVE BOTH OF MY EYES I'D STILL BE ANDREW IN THOSE OR TWO PIECES OF MY SENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO MY DAILY LIFE BUT I'D STILL BE ME YOU'REAS AM AND THIS DOESN'T I THINK JUST APPLY TO MEMORY SYSTEMS I MEAN I THINK THEIR REASIONS OF THE FRONTAL QUARTECS THAT WHEN DESTROYED HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO MODIFY PERSONALITY AND SELF PERCE PTION IN IN DRAMATIC WAYS SO IT'S A SORT OF OBVIOUS POINT ONCE IT'S MADE BUT I DO THINK IT'S WORTH A  HIGH LIGHTING CAUSE THERE DOES SEEM TO BES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT BEING IN THE HEAD THE OTHER THING IS THAT A SITTING A FEW SENTIMETERS BELOW THE SURFACE OR RIDING IN THIS CONTAINER MAKE SENSE TO ME EXCEPT I I WONDER IF YOU'VE EVER AM EXPERIENCE  SHIFT AS I HAVE WHEN SOMETHING VERY EXTREME HAPPENS THAT US THE THE NEGATIVE EXAMPLE OF YOU KNOW ALL WA SEN YOU'RE IN A FIERCE STATE ALL OF A SUDDEN IT FEELS AS IF YOUR ENTIRE BODY IS IS YOU WORS ME AND IS AND AND NOW I NEED TO GET THIS THING THE WHOLE CONTAINER AN ME TO SOME PLACE OF SAFETY IN WHAT  WHATEVER FORM A THIS IS ALSO TERE I THINK IN ECSTATIC STATES YWE CAN FEEL REALLY WHEN PEOPLL SAY EMBODIED I WONDER WHETHER NOT WE NORMALLY OSCILLATE BELOW THE SURFACE OF OUR BODY WHEN I SAY OSCILLATE I MEAN IN NERL TERMS O ME MAY BE OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCE IS NOT TRULY AT THE BODILY SURFACE BUT SITS BELOW THE BODILY SURFACE MORE AT THE LEVEL OF ORGAN SYSTEMS EM WITHIN OUR HEAD AND THEN CERTAIN THINGS THAT JOLT US OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM INTO HEIGHTEN STATES BRING US INTO STATES OF AM YOU DON'T BRING US CLOSER TO THE SURFACE AND THEREFORE INCLUDE ALL OF US AGEIN I DON'T WANT TO TAKE US DOWN A A MECHANISTIC DESCRIPTION OF OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST BUT IS ANY OF THAT RESONATE A IN TERMS OF HOW YOURE THINKING ABOUT HER DESCRIBING THE SELF YE YETHR THERE'S A LOT THERE  E FIRST ON THE POINT OF THE BRAIN BEING E O  THE LOCUS OF OF WHAT WE ARE AS MINE IM YET I REMEMBER THERERE PEOPLE WHO WILL INSIS THAT THROUG THE WHOLE NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS TO BE THOUGHT OF IS ABLE YOU TALKIN ABOUT OUR EMOTIONAL LIFE AN YELLY THE THE IM THE THE INSOLEN'S CONNECTION TO OTHE GOT AND JUSHETHE SENSE OF OF SELF EXTENDS BEYOND THE BRAIN BUT II TOTALLY TAKE YOUR POINT THAT A BRAIN TRANSPLANTED IS A COHERENT IDEA AND YOU WOULD EXPECT TO GO WITH THE BRAIN RATHER THAN WITH TETHE VISERA AND IM SO IN THAT SENSE WE REALLY ARE THE THE OLD PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT IT'S MARIMENT OF  BEEN A BRAIN AND O TAT MAY WE SENTIALY ARE ALREADY  KNOWTHE VAT AS OUR SKULL AND WE'RE UNNIVERTUALLY IN THAT SITUATION IM THE HORRIBLE MOVY I'M SIR I CAN HO PAN ENTER UP WHEN I WAS A A TEENATOR MY SISTER N I US SCURE THE MOVIES EVERYONE IN WHILD WE'D TRADE OFF WHO COULD PICT THE MOVI AND AM SHE TOOK ME TO SEE ONCE THE MOVI BOXING COLLENA THE DAVID LYNCH FILL  NEVER SAWEVER HE AMPUTATES THE LIMBS OF A WOMAN WHO HE'S OBSESS BY AND KEEPS SIR ITS A REALLY HORRIBLE PHIM AND ABOUT TWENTY MENUTES INTO IT MY SISTER DESTURNED TO ME AND SAID ISSORRY AND THE QUESTION THEN WAS WHETHER NOT TOO SIBBLING SHOULD ACTUALLY PERSIST IN A MOVI LIKE THAT  WE DECIDED TO PERSIST IN THE MOVIES THAT WE COAL LAUGH ABOUT IT LATER A BUT IT WAS RATHER DISTURBING I DON'T RECOMMEND THE MOVI NOR DO I RECOMMENSING IT WITH A SIBBLING BUT IN THAT MOVY THAT THE WOMAN HE HE TAKES HER AS A CONTAINER AN AND RESTRICTS ER MOVEMENT RIG RIT SODISTIC AND OUR ABLE THING REALLY AM DAVID LYNCH AM INTERESTING MIND PERHAPS BUT THE THE IDEA WAS THAT A WAS TO QUESTION HOW MUCH OF THE PERSON PERSIST IN THE ABSENCE OF THERE ABILITY TO MOVE ET CETERA COULD THERE BE LOVE COULD THERE BE THESE THE OTHER AFFECTIONS A MAY RATHER EXTREME EXAMPLE BUT A ONE THAT I THAT STILL HAUNTS ME IN A SOMETHINKING ABOUT STILL NA WHATSO JUST TO FOLLOW THAT POINT  THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT ABOUT US THAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO UNLESS WE ENACT IT PHYSICALLY LIKELING IF I ASKED YOU YOU KNOW DO YOU STILL KNOW HOW TO WRITE A BIKE RIT THERE'S NO PLACE IN YOUR MEMORY WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN INSPECT BY YOUNJUST SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR THAT YOU YOU'VE RETAINED THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO WITE A BITE RIT LIKE AS THE PRECEEDUAL MEMORIES DIFFERENT FROM SAMANTIC OR APOSOTIC MEMORY OF I ASKED YOU YOU KNOW D DO YOU KNOW YOUR ADDRESS YES YOU CAN RECALL YOUR ADDRESS JUST SITTING THERE BUT IF YOU IF YOU HAD HAD A MICRO STROKE THAT NEATLY DISSECTED OUT YOUR BILITY TO WRITE A BIKE YOU KNOWAN AND LEFT EVERYTHING ELSE IN TACT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT THINK YOU COULD WRITE A BITE BUT SUDDENLY YOU STAND UP NEXT TO ONE AND YOU HAVE NO IDEAT WHAT TO DO WITH IT AND THAT WOULD BE A DISCOVERY THAT WOULD ONLY HAPPEN IF YOU WERE YO MOTORICALLY ENGAGED WITH THAT YOU KNOW OBJECT IM AND I'M SURE THERE'S OU KNOW WE COULD PROBABLY COME UP WITH A HUNDRED THINGS ABOUT US THAT REALLY SEEM CORD TO US AND WEAND AN UNNOTSEPARABLE FOR OUR YOU KNOW FROM OUR OUKNOW PERSONHOOD WHICH SEEM TO ONLY CU YOU'D ONLY GET IN VOKED WHEN WE'RE OU OUT THEIR MOVING IN THE WORLD AND YOU KOW WE HAVE LIMBS ET CETERA IM AND IBUT YET NO IT'S THA THE SEAT OF A CONSCIOUSNESS AN ME TIT I THE RIGHT FRAME WORK TO TALK ABOUT ALL THIS FROM MY POINT OF VIEWIS CONSCIOUSNESS AN ITS CONTENTS RIGHT SO WE HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THTAS LIKE TO BE US RTE THE FACT THAT THAT  THE WORLD AND OUR INTERNAL EXPERIENCE IS IS ILLUMINATED THAT IT HAS A QUALITATIVE CHARACTER IM AND THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS THAT QUALITY OF CHARACTER WHAT IS IT  KNOW WHAT KINDS OF INFORMATION TO WE HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT IS AT FEEL LIKE TO BE US HOW DO HOW TO DIFFERENT STATES OF AROUSAL CHANGE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT FEAR ATMEN FEAR CAN CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS BUT IM I AND YOU KNOW VERY SNEROLOGICAL DEFISITS OR YOU KNOW YOU K U CAN ADD DRUGS TO THE MAXES YOU HAD PSYCHODELIC THAT YOU THE RADICALLY TURRENT TRANSFORM THE CONSTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS FROM MY POINT OF VIEW CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF IS SIMPLY THE THE COGNESSENCE THE AWARINESS THIS THAT THAT IS THE THE FLOOD LIGHTS BY WHICH ANY OF THAT STUFF APPEARS WRITES SO IM CONSCIOUSNESS DOESN'T CHANGE BUT ITS CONTENTS CHANGE AND  TO COME BACK TO MEDITATION FOR A SECOND MANY PEOPLE THINK MEDITATION IS ABOUT CHANGING THE CONSTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS YOU WITHERE SOME CON SOME CONSTENT YOU ANT TO GO RID OF LIKE ANXIETY OTHER CONTENTS YOU WANT TO TO IN COURAGE LIKE CALM AND YOU KNOW O UNCONDITIONAL LOVE OR YOU SOME OTHER YOUR CLASSICALLY PLEASANT PROSOCIAL EMOTION A ND THAT'S ALL FINE THAT'S ALL POSSIBLE BA THE REAL THE WISDOM OF INTHE TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD WISDOM OF MEDITATION THAT REALLY IS THE EN OF THE THE CHEWY CENTER OF THE THE TUSTYPOP IS A RECOGNITION OF WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF IS ALWAYS ALREADY LIKE REGARDLESS OF THE CONTENTS AND THE CHANGES IN CONTENTS AND THIS IS WHY A WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT THIS BUT THIS WIDE THER MUTUALLY COMPATIBLE A PSYCHADELICS AND MEDITATION FROM MERE SOMEWHAT OR THOGNAL BECAUSE PSYCHADELICS IS ALL ABOUT MAKING WHOLESALE CHANGES TO THE CONTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND AND THERE'S A EING OF SOME WONDERFUL CONSEQUENCES OF DOING THAT THERE CAN BE SOME HERROWING AND TERRIFYING CONSEQUENCES OF DOING THAT BUT A GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK YOU KNOW OUUSED USED WISELY THEY CAN BE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE AND AND THE THERAPUTIC POTENTIAL THERE IS ENORMOUS BUT THE CRUCIAL DISJUNCTION HERE IS THAT THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING TO RECOGNIZE ABOUT ORDINARY WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT'S COMPATIBLE WITH MY DRIVING A CAR TO GET HERE ON TIME RIGHT  YU  YU DON'T HAVE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE PYRATE TECHNICS OF BE BEYOND ALAS DE TO SEE THE THE THI  TO TRANSCEND THE CENTRAL ILLUSION THAT I'M I'M SAYING IS IS THAT THE THING TO BE TRANSCENDENT WHICH IS THE SENSE THAT THERE IS A DUALOTY BETWEEN SUBJECT AND OBJECT IN EVERY MOMENT OF EXPERIENCE A AND TO TAKE IT BACK TO TO SOMETHING YOU SAID ABOUT JUST ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT MODES IN ORDINARY LIFE THE INTERESTING THING IS I THINK PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY LOSING THEIR SENSE OF SELF AND THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF IT AND THAT ETHER THERE'S A   PROBABLY AN ANALOGY TO THE VISUAL SYSTEM HERE WHICH IS A TO A VISUAL SACODS WHICH A PERHAPS YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT AS SIMPOINE ON YOUR PODCAST NOT ENOUGH SO PLEASE YE A SO SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH OUR YOU KNW EVERY TIME WE MOVE OUR EYES IS CALLED A A SACADEAND WE DO THAT ABOUT YOU THREE TIMES A SECOND OR SO I JUST NORMALLY A THERE IS A YOU KNOW THE THE RESON OF MOTOR QUARTECTS THAT THAT EFFECTS THAT MOVEMENT SENDS WAS CALLED AND AN EFFERENT COPY OF THAT MOTOR MOVEMENT A WHICH I WHICH AS USED AS INFORMATION THE PROPAGATES BACK TO VISUAL QUARTECTS AS SUPPRESSES A THE DATA OF VISION WHILE THE EYES ARE MOVING BECAUS OTHERWISE IF YOU WAREN'T DOING THAT EVERY TIME YOU MOVED YOUR EYES IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE VISUAL SEENE ITSELF WAS LURCHING AROUND AND PEOPLE CAN EXPERIENCE THIS FOR THEMSELVES IF THEY JUST YOU KNOW TOUCH ONE OF THEIR EYEBALLS ON THE SIDE YOU KNOW NOT ALL THAT HEART AND CON JIGGL IT YOU KNOW NTY THIN YOU CAN ROLL IT AROUND YOU CAN JIGLER FROM SIDE TO SIDE YOU CAN SEE THAT A A A A MOVEMENT OF THE EYEBALL THAT'S NOT GOVERNED BY YOUR OCULAR MOTOR SYSTEM DELIVERIS A JIGGLING OF THE WORLD BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOUR BRAIN IS NOT ANTICIPATING IN THE SAME WAY IN IS NOT YOU'RE NOT PRODUCING AT THE THE SAME A IN A PREDICTIVE A COPY OF OF THE MOVEMENT IT'S A LOW BIT LIKE AM I THE SOME ACTION SPORTS FULNERS ON OUR STAFF HERE THA THE GIMBLE YOU KNOW THAT HOLDS IT ANIF ONLY YOU SEE THE KIDS TO IT ON YOU SIR ORDS OU SCAPE WORDS YOUR SELLING THERE YOU HOLD A PHONE WHILE MOVING AROUND OR THE PEOPLE WHO THE VLOGGERS SAY WHEN YOU EEN STILL USE THAT A MOVING AROUND AND TO IT'S IT'S IMAGE STABLIZATION ENTUALLY A THAT KEEPS THE THE CAMERA STEADY AND THESE ARE MORE THAN CAMEROUS OF COURSE TTHE  THOS LESSEN A POINT AT MY EYES BUT HEY  FAR MORE THAN JUST WHAT A CAMER WOULD DO BUT YET THIS INTERNAL SYSTEM OF OF IMAGE STABLIZATION YI CAN SEE A PERHAPS WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS AM THAT THAT IT ALLOWS US TO REMAIN IN A SELF REFERENCE AND SCHEME AS OPPOSE TO A THE SORT PAYING ATTENTION TO JUST HOW CONFUSING IT IS TO DETRACT THE VISUAL WORLD AT SOME LEVEL WHAT UD I ACTULLY WHERE I'M GOING IS IT SO WITH PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS SUPPRESSION OF VISION  THREE TIMES A SECOND ON AVERAGE AND THEY'RE NOT EXPERIENCIN IT RIE SLIK YOU'RE LIKE YOU'RE T LITERLLY LIKE YOU YOUR EFFECTIVELY GOING BLIND AND YOU'RE NOT NOTICING IT AND A IS VERY FAST YES ER'S VERY FAST NOW THERE THERE'S AN ANALOGOUS A SUPPRESSION I WOULD SAY OF THE SENSE IF SELF THAT OCCURS EVERY TIND ATTENTION GETS ABSORBED SIGNIFICANTLY IN HIS OBJECT RICE SLIYE ALY WL YOU WE EVEN HAVE THIS CONCEPT OF YOU LOSING YOURSELF IN YOUR WOR OR YOU YOU LOSING YOUR UTHE CLASSIC FLOW EXPERIENCES HAVE THIS THIS QUALITY WHERE THERE'S THA IN THIS THES TENSE TO BE WHYTHEY'R SO REWARDIND A WHERE THERE'S JUST IF YO'REN IN SOME IN ATHLETIC ACTIVITY OR YOU KNOW AN AESTHETIC ONE A OR YOUCOULD BE HAVING SEX OR Y WHATEVER IT IS SOME PIQUE EXPERIENCE ITS PIQUENESS USUALLY INTALS THERE BEING SOME BRIEF PERIOD WHERE THERE WAS NO DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE EXPERIENCE RIGHT THE FOR THAT MOMENT YOU WERE NO LONGER LOOKING OVER YOUR OWN SHOULDER OR ANTICIPATING THE NEXT MOMENT OR TRYING TO GET SOMEWHERE WERE WERE YOU WARRENT OR YOU A MIKERO MANAGING ERRS OR YU LIKE THES YOUNOF THIS NOT THERE'S JUST THE FLOW OF UNITY WITH WHATEVER THE THAT IU O WHATEVER THE EXPERIENCES YOU OV A SURFER ON IT ON THE WAY RIGHT A AND WE LOVE THOSE EXPERIENCES A AND THEN WE ARE CONTINUALLY ABSTRACTED AWAY FROM THEM BY AR THINKING ABOUT THEM WHAT WELL O THINK ALMENT O THET BUT HT WAS SO GOOD OR HOW DO I GET BACK TO THAT OR AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SUNSET IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SENSE TAT YOUE EVER SEEN AND THEN YOU'RE CONTINUALLY INTERRUPTING THE EXPERIENCE OF MERELY SEEN IT WITH A COMMENTARY ABOUT HOW AMAZING ESS IS AND I I WONDER YE WHAT A REAL ESTATE PRICES AR HERE I MAKE IT'S A POSSIBLE ACT WE CU W COULD MOVE HERE AND LIKE YOU U  YOUR MIND IS JUST CONTINUALLY NARRATING A HI CONVERSATION YOU'RE HAVING WITH YOURSELF HOW RE PARADOXICALLY AMD YOU'RE TELLING YOURSELFS THING YOUR  SELF THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW A AS THOUGH THERE WERE TWO OF YOU RATHER OFTEN RIGHT LIKE YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST YOU I'M LOOKING FOR  WHICH WHICH IS THE WATER AND S O THERE IT IS RE BUT LIKE I 'M THE ONE SEEN IT WHO AM I SAYING O THAT OUO THERE IT IS TO AS HOUGH THERE SOME ONE ELSE WHO NEEDS TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE THING I ALREADY SAW RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S A THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT OUR INTERNAL DIALOGUE THAT IS PARADOXICAL AI IS THERE ANY A NEUROLOGIC CONDITION IM A CALLL SELECT TO ME OR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WHERE SOMEHOW PEOPLE FEEL MORE UNIFIED WITH THE SELF ON IT CONTINUAL BASIS A THE OBSERVER AND THE ACT OR WITH YUNG WHETHER  STATE WORE MORE IM IS AS A COMPLETE SENTENCE IS THERE ANY KNOWN NEUR LOGICAL CINDRA THEY SENELIKE A BAD THING BUT COULD BE GOOD THING WHEREBY PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE ACTOR AND THE OBSERVER WITHIN THEM ARE UNIFIED CONTINUAL THERE'S NOT A PATHOLOGICAL ONE IT SOME OF THEM THE WORK ON THE DEFAULT MODE N AT WORK SUGGEST AT THATS AT LEAST PART OF THE STORY RI SO THE DEFAULT MODE NET WORK I THE WHICH HAS BEN TALKTD TO ABOUT A LOT OF LATE BECAUSE ITS IT HAS COME UP BOTH IN THE IN THE MEDITATION LITERATURE AND IN THE PSYCHODELIC LITERATURE A BUT IT'S ORIGINAL A DISCOVERY WAS THAT YOUNOW AND THE REASON I WAS CALLED THE DEFAULT MODE WAS S THAT IN VERSUALLY EVERY NOUR IMAGING EXPERIMENT EVER RUN THEY FOUND THAT BETWEEN TASKS WHEN THE BRAIN WAS JUST IN ITS DEFAULT STATE THETHESE THESE MIDLINE STRUCTURES WOULD WOULD TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITY AND THEN THEY WOULD THEN THEY WOULD RELIABLY DIMINISH WHENEVER THE PERSON IN THE SCAN OR WAS I WAS ON TASK AND USUALLY THAT MEN SOME KIND OF OUTWARD LOOKING IM OU NO VISUAL DISCRIMINATION TASK I MI BUT IT COULD BE COULD IT COULD BE VISUAL COL BE SAMANTIC IT COULD BE BUT THER THETENDS TO BE THEIR EYES ARE OPEN AND THEIR PAN ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT'S BEING BROADCAST OF THEM THROUGH YOU A MONITOR GOGGLES IM ORING ANOTHER LOOK IN I A MIRROR THAT SHOWING THEM A COMPUTER MONTOR I BUT THE O  THE GENERAL INSIGHT WAS THERE THESE MIDLINE STRUCTURES IN THE BRAIN THAT SEEM TO BE I INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITY WHEN THE BRAIN IS JUST KIND OF IDLING BETWEEN TASK WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN  AND THEN FURTHER EXPERIMENTS FOUND TASKS THAT ACTUALLY UPREGULATED I  ACTIVITY THER BEYOND BASE LINE AND THOSE TASKS SEEM TO BE SELF REFERENTIAL SO THAT WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE THEN  YOU GIVE IM A LIST OF WORDS AND YOU SAY WOULD DO THESE ANY ANITYES APPLY TO YOU RIGHT YOU KNOW AND SO PEOPLE A R OR YOU ASKED PEOPLE T THINK ABOUT I I YOU'E ACTING WHAT ONE EXPERIMENT I DID WHEN YOU YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE CHALLENGING PEOPLE'S BELIEFS I WHEN YOU'RE CHALLENGING BELIEFS THAT IT HAVE MORE OF A PERSONAL SIGNIFICANCE LIKE A POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS YOU GET AN UP REGULATION IN THESE REGENTS IS UPPOSED A JUST GENERIC BELIEFS ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN LOST ANGEL AS THIS IS A TABLE YONOTHER IS SOMETHING TO WHICH BEING A PEOPLE ARE NOT YOU KNOW I HOLDING FAST AS A MATTER OF IDENTITY IM SO ANYWAY BOTH MEDITATION AND PSYCADELICS SEEM TO SUPPRESS ACTIVITY IN THESE IN THESE REGIONS WHICH WE KNOW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH SELF TALK MIND WANDERING AND AND EXPLICIT ACTS OF SELF REPRESENTATION RIGHT SO COULD WE SAY THAT THEY ARE SOMEWHAT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL BECAUSE THEY ACCESS MEMORY SYSTEMS AND IN THE WAY YOU'RE DESCRIBING THEM AND IN THE WAY THAT A A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHO'S BEEN A GUEST ON THIS POCKASS AT DON IF YOU'VE INTERACT WITH BEFORE BUT I THINK YOU'D VERY MUCH ENJOY WHATEVER INTERACTION YOU WOULD HAVE IS AM DAVID SPEAGLE HE IS OUR ASSOCIATE SURE O SICHIETRIES A HE AN IS FATHER ACTUALLY HIS FATHER THAN HE FOUNDED UM HYPNOSIS AS A VALID CLYNICAL PRACTICE IN LATITRETED HYPNOSIS WHICH IS I SEE A HEIGHTENED SENSE OF ATTENTION WITH DEEP RELAXATION IS KNOWN TO A DRAMATICALLY SUPPRESS THE THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK  HE TALKS ABOUT THE SALADN I I ALWAYS WONDER AS WE UM TAKE DOWN ACTIVITY WITHIN THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK WHAT SURFACE IS IT IN ITS PLACE AND IS WHAT SURFACE IS N ITS PLACE UM DOES THAT SOMEHOW REFLECT THAT THE TWO ARE NORMALLY IN A PUSHPOL HES DOS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE WHEN I FALL ASLEEP I CAN HALLUCINATE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DURING THE DAY MY A THE FACT THAT I'M LOOKING AT OBJECTS IS IS WHAT'S PREVENTING ME FROM HALLUCINATING I CLOSE MY EYES I CAN GET IMAGERY BUT THE OTHERS THIS KIND OF A AA DIFFERENT ILLUSION THE ILLUSION OF ANTAGONISTIC CIRCATRY SOMETIMES U I DO'T ONT TAKE US OFF COURSE BUT THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK SEEMS TO UM WANT TO BE THERE UC ITS IT SEEMS TO BE FIGHTING FOR FOR OUR ATTENTION IM UNLESS WE GIVE OURSELVES A VISUAL TARGETED ON ARDITORY TARGET OR SOME SAILINT EXPERIENCE OF SOME KIND IT SOUNDS LIKE AND THEN IF UM I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT MEDITATION REDUCES ACTIVITY IN THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AT SOME LEVEL BECAUSE MEDITATION TO ME OFTENTIMES INVOLVES UM PAYING ATTENTION TO SOME SORT OF PERCEPTIONAL TARIGET  MAYBE COULD U EVENTUALLY EXPLAIN AS TO AHOW IT MIGHT DO THAT OR WHY T MY DEAR AND AND NO I DON'T THINK IT'S THE WHOLE STORY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY OUTWARE GOING ATTENTION IS NOT IM EVEN IF YOU'RE HAVING THE KIND OF EGOIC SA COD THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT CLEARLY AWARE OF OF YOURSELF OURE NOT CLEARLY DEFINING YOURSELF AS SEPARATE FROM EXPERIENCE I FOR THE MOMENT OF PAYIN ATTENTION SO YOU ARE SIRF LOSING YOURSELF IN YOUR WORK THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS HAVING THE CLEAR MEDITATIVE INSIGHT OF SELFLESSNESS THAT I'M THAT I'M SUCLAIMING AS THE GOAL OF MEDITATION IM BUT THERE IS A YOUTO WINE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL POINT I WAS MAKING AN THE REASON WHY I DROUG THE REV THE ANALGIT TO VISUAL SACODS I DO THINK THERE'S A CONTINUOUS INTERRUPTION IN OUR SENSE IF SELF THAT GOES ONRECOGNIZED AND IM BUT BUT THE CONSCIOUS I ACQUISITION O  THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SELF IS AN ILLUSION IS A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE AND ITS BECAUSE YOU'R YOURE THEN YOU'RE THEN FOCUSSING ON THIS ABSENCE ACTAL THERE'S ANOTHER ANALOGY TO TO VISUAL SYSTEM THAT APPLIES HERE WHICH IS TO THE THE OPTIC BLIND SPOT AND MIS LIKE SO IM WHICH IS A GOOD ANALOGY FOR ME BECAUSE IT CUTS THROUGH A BUNCH OF FALSE ASSUMPTION AS TO W CON O WARE THAT YOU WOULD LOOK FOR THIS OR HOW THIS RELATES TO ORDINARY EXPERIENCE SO AS MAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE HAVE UING BOTH EYES WE HAVE  WAS CALLED THE BLIND SPOT WHICH IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE OPTIC NERVE TRANSITING THROUGH THE RETIN I'M NOT UNLIKE A SEPHLIPODS I THINK MTHINK SEPHLIPODS I HAVE THEIR OPTEC NERVE OU KNOW AS YOU KNOW A AN OMNISSION BEING WOULD HAVE ENGINEERED IT IT CONNECTING THE RETINA FROM THE BACK AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO BLINDS THE AREA A BLINDNESS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS TRANSIT BACK THROUGH THE RETINA BARTOTORECEPTERS ON THE OUTSIDE EXACTLY E HUMANS WHATEVER REASON A PUT PHOTORES WEL I WIL SAY I WASN'T CONSULVE THE DESIGN FACE SOME THING IL PUT A PHOTORECEPTORS AM COMBINATION OF THINGS BUT PHOTORECEPTORS IN THE BACK AND SO YU YOU I SHOU HAVE TO SEND THE HIGHWAY OF ARATIA THROUGH THROUGH THE PICSIL CENTER OF THE OF THE EYE YESEPHLOPODS AND OBGRESOPHLA ON EARTHLY A A INVERTEBRATES R A THE DESIGN IS MORE AT ITS FACE LOGICAL MANALS VERY ILLOGICAL DESIGN AT LEAST AS FARS O JUDGMENTS BUT IT GIVES  GIVES ME GOOD ANALOGY SO I'LL TAKE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED AG ONE IS A VITAMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE IS MY STORRY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE OUTHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOD IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBOTICS ANOTHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS AN NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE GRAPE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBORMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FR EE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP OUTH LETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VIT HIM IN TE THREE C TOO AGAIN THAT'S THAT LETT IT GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUMORMAN TO GET THE FIVEFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY A VIT HIM INTE THRE K TO SO I MANY CAS WE HAVE THIS BLIND SPOT WHICH YOU CAN I THINK MOST PEOPLE LEARN THIS IN SCHOOL ALTHOUGH MY DAUGHTERS HAD NOT BEEN TAUGHT THE SINCE COLI TO SHOW THEM THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME I A MONTH AGO WHICH AND THEY WERE BRIEFLY FASCINATED THAN THEN WHEN I RETURNED TO THEIR SCREEN TIME A BUT A ANYWAY OU CAN TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER AND YOU MAKE IN A TWO MARKS ON IT AND THEN YOU COVER ONE EYE AND YOU FIXATE ON ON ONE MARK A MAME YOU CAN LOOK THIS UP ON LINE IF YOU NEED I DETAILS OB HAV TO DO THIS AND YOU  BILE STARING AT ONE FIXATION POINT YOU MOVE HTHE PAPER BACK AND FORTH AND YOU CAN GET IT TO A PLACE WHERE THE OTHER MARK DISAPPEARS AND THAT AND IF AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN RUN THIS EXPERIMENT LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOURSELF THAT THERE IS IN FACT TO BLIND SPOT IN YOUR VISUAL FIELD WHICH YOU WITH ONE EYE CLOSED YOU DON'T NORMALLY NOTICE A THE REASON WY Y HAVE TO COVER IT YOU COVER ONE EYES BECAUSE EACH EYE COMPENSATES FOR THE THE BLIND SPOT OF THE OTHER SO A BUT WHAT WHICHIS TO SAY THAT IF YOU CLOSE ONE EYE AND AND SURVEY THE VISUAL SEEN SOMETHING REALLY IS MISSING WHATEVER YOU'RE LOOKING AT IF YOU'R LOOKIN AT A CROWD OF PEOPLE SOMEBODY IS MISSING AHEAD AND YOU'RE NOT NOTICING IT AND IT'S NOT I'S NOT EASY TO NOTICE BECAUSE A YOU KNOW THE THE BRAIN DOESN'T TEND TO VIVIDLY REPRESENT THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION I MAYS JUST LIKE THITHIS JUST PART OF THE GAME THATS NOT BEING RENDERED IS NOT IS NOT SHOWING UP AS A A BREAK IN YOUR IN THE VISUAL FIELD IS JUST NOT THERE AND YOURE I MAN THE PEOPLE OF ARGUED THAT THEYRE'S A A KIND OF FILLING IN PHENOMENON THAT HAPPENS BUT I THINK THAT CAN BE YOU KNOW  MISUNDERSTOOD OR OR EXAGGERATED BUT THE EYE MOVEMENTS THEMSELVES YOU DESCRIBE BEFORE IT THE AS SI SHOULD SAY THAT THE YE TI SACOD ANALOGY OF BOUT AM TRTRANSIENTLY AND REPETTED LE ERASING THESELF ARKS PERFECTLY HERE BECAUSE INDEED MICRO SACODS THE SMALLER SOCCOTS AY CUR ALL THE TIME ALSO PREVENT OUR  EYES FROM VIXATING ONE LOCATION IS LONG ENOUGH TO ESERVE OUR BLINDSPOT EVEN IF WHONE EYES CLOSE I ISO IF WE AD THA THE EXPEREMENTS DONE WITH PARALYTICS TO SENSIAN LOCK EYES AN ONE LOCATION BASY THINGS JUS START DISAPPEAR YE IT JUST TEY LONG O TAD RESURSING UT ACSHOULD WE START GOING BLIND AND THOSE EXPERMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE AND ONHUMAN SIT I HEAR THEY'RE QUITE TERRIFYING YEYE YE BANMEN YOU CAN DO THAT FOR YOURSELF DO IT JUST BE IT BEGINS TO JUST OI EMELT AWAY AND INLE IN A WARM GLOW A NO PSYCHODELICS REQUIRED BUT THE THE INTERESTING POINT THERE IS THAT WHEN YOU ASK YOURSELF OCUS OF THIS BECAUSE OF AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE EYES AN ATOMY THERE'S THIS THIS THING YOU CAN SEE ETHER THAT IS ABSENT FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE BUT THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS THAT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE RES ST OF YOU TO YOUR MIND T LEAUS THAT DEEP WITHIN OR IS THAT SOME SENSORIHT ON THE SURFACE OF EXPERIENCE AND THERE'S THIS EXPECTATION THAT PEOPLE HAVE AGAIN I THINK CONFLATING MEDITATION WITH WITH A SEARCH FOR CHANGES IN THE CONTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS HA LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW YOU KNOW A MUCH MORE SUBTLE THINGS TO TO TO NOTICE ABOUT THE MIND OR MUCH YOU NOW VASTER THINGS TO NOTICE IM PSYCHODELIC SETS UP THIS THIS EXPECTATION THAT YU DO YOU KNOW A MASS OF DOSE OF MUSHROOMS OR ELESTY AND EVERYTHING CHANGES AND ME JUST GET THIS FULL YOU KNOW BEITIFIC VISION I AND N YOU GET YOU NOT ONLY VISUAL CHANGES BUT YOU KNOW EMOTIONAL CHANGES AND AND YOU GET SYNES THESIA WHERE Y LIKE YOU'R JUST YOU HAVE MUCH MORE MIND IN IN IN SO MANY WAYS IM SO THEY BEGIN UHAVING THESE EXPERIENCES OR READING THE MYSTICAL LITERATURE YOU BEGIN TO THINK OOK ABLE THAN FREEDOM IS IT'S REALLY ELSEWHERE OR IS IT'S REALLY IT'S DEEP WITHIN IS LIKE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT COINCIDENT WITH THE ORDINARY AWARINESS THAT CAN  THAT CONSEE THIS COFFEE CUP CLEARLY AND THAT CAN  TRANSITION ATTENTION TO YOU KNOW READING ANYMAL I U WILL IT WIT WITH A A FULL SOBRIETY OF JUST YOU KNOW YOU N ORDINARY WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS IM BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS INSIGHT INTO SELFLESSNESS IS INSIGDT INTO THE NONDUALITY OF SUBJECT AND OBJECT IS AS CLOSE TO ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS AS THIS INSIDE INTO THE OP TO BLIND SPOT LIKE WHAT WHERE DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO HAVE THIS INSIGHT INTO THE BLINDS BUT NOW YOU UST HAVE TO YIF OU GO ANYWHERE YOU USTHVE TO SET UP THAT THE THE EXPERIMENT CORRECTLY SUCH THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN SEE THE DATA BUT THE DATE IS RIGHT ON THE SURFACE IT'S LIKE ITS IT'S IT'S ALMOST TOO CLOSE TO YOU TO NOTICE AND I IT I'S AT ALL HARD TO NOTICE IT'S BECAUE IT'S BECAUSE IT' SO CLOSE RATHER THAN IT'S BE KNO DEEP WITHIN OR FAR AWAY I AND THERE ARE OTHER ANALOGIES LIKE IM I DON'T REMEMBER THOSE MINDS I PIECES OF ART WORK THAT WITH AS THE RANDOM DOT STERIO GRAMITYAYOU HAVE AN IMAGE AT POPS OUT IM I'VE ALWAYS FIND IT VERY DIFFICUL TO SEE THOSE  LETE NOW VERY DOMINANT I YOU KNOW BUT I PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THOSE THESE OF TESE IMAGES THAT YOU SEEM ET THE KIND LIKE TURISTY SHOPS OFI BUT YOU WOILL SY OH THERE IT IS THE WALE I M THINK I DON'T AN YET IM YOU NON KIDS THAT SWIM ALO WHEN THEY'RE YOUNGER AND THER I TEND TO BREATHE JUST TO ONE SIDE I WRITE IF THIS WAS YOU THIS ENOAN ETEND TO UM WELL KEEP ONE EYE CLOSE YOU SET UP A PRETTY STRONG OCULAR DOMINANTS AT BYSING YOUR VISION TO ONE OR THE OTHER EYE EARLY IN LIFE WETHER N OR LEARNING HOW TO BE A BAW HUNTER OR YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO THROW DARTS OR SHOOT BILLIARDS OR ANYTHING INVALLS AM SELECTIVLY VIEWING THE WORLD THROUGH ONE EYE FOR EVEN A COUPLE OF HOURS CAN SET UP A PERMANENT IM IA SYMETRY IN THE WAITING OF A VISUAL FLOW I IMFR A FLOW O VISUAL INFORMATION FROM THE EYE OF THE BRAIN A IT'S REVERSIBLE BUT ONLY THROUGH THE REVERSE GYMNASTICS OF COVERING UP THE OTHER I ANDTR S I SHOULD BE ID TO BE REVERSE PATCHED FOR WHILE CAS I WA SEEN DOUBLE BECAUSE I LOST BY NOCULAR VISION I DON'T STAND A CHANCE IN HELL OF SEEING AN IMAGE POP OUT OF RANDER YOASTER S CAVE IRONIC AS I DID MY PCE OWN BY NOCULAR CIRCUITRY BY RON AND NONE THE LESS YET IF PEOPLE CAN SEE THESE UM WERE IF THEY CAN'T WUTI THINK THEY PROVIDE A REALLY TERIFIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING BOUT IT AS A LARGER THEME WHICH IS THAT PERCEPTIONALLY YOU SEE ABUNCH ADOTS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN R WHAT YOU THOUGHT WASN'T THERE SUDDENLY THERE BUT CAN DISDISAPPEAR AGAIN OR THERE ARE CERTAIN VISUALILLUSIONS IF WE WERE TO INCLUDE OTHERS THAT ONCE YOU SEE THEM YOU CANNOT UNSEE THEM RSO THERE'S THE FACES VACES YOU KNOW FIGURE GROUND TYPE STUFF THE VERY RY US ABY IABL PERCEPTS AN NOT BY STABLE PERCEPTS AND THEN THERE SORT OF UM OCULAR COMPETITION YOU SHOW TWO DIFFERENT IMAGES TO THE EYES THAT EACH OF THE TWO EYES  IT IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO PERCEIVE THEM BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY  UM SOIT'S A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AM AND YHOU SEEM TO BE FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES ABOUT THE WAY THE MORAL CIRCUITS ARE ORGANIZED THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO STABLY WETHEY DON WANT A STAY FIXATED ON ANY ONE THING FORE VERY LONG TO DO SO EITHER TAKES TRAINING INTENSE INTEREST INTENSE FEAR INTENSE EXCITEMENT MI SAY INTENSE I GESS I COME BACK TO THIS IDEA THAT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS SOMEHOW GOVERNING OUR ABILITY TO UM SPOTLIGHT AT ANY ONE LOCATION FOR VERY LONG IS THAT IS THAT A USEFUL FRAMEWORK OR AS ICANG TO TAKE US DOWN AN DIFFERENT WHAT IS IT SORT OF A DFFERENT PATH FOR THIS ME FRTHE ONLY POINT I WAS MAKING AS THAT THIS SEEMINGLY PARADOX WIL CLAIM THAT SOMETHING CAN BE RIGHT ON THE SURFACE AND YET HARD TO SEE RIGHT SO THIKE THAT THAT THERE THINGS THAT ARE BECAUSE IT'S AND AGAIN THIS THIS THIS SEEMS TO JUSTIFY THE EXPECTATION HELD BY I WOULD THINKIN OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO GET INTERESTED IN THESE YOU KNOW SPIRITUAL THINGS FOR LACK OR BETTER WORD IM THAT THE TRUTH MUST SOMEHOW BE DEEP WITHIN RIGHT LIKELY THY LIETING  THERE'S REALLY LIKE THERE'S SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN WHERE YOURE BUT BETWEEN THE ONE WHO IS LOOKING AND THE THING THAT HAS TO BE FOUND RIGHT AND TH YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS THIS LONG EVOLUTION OF CHANGES AND THAT THE MANY METAPHORS IS AT THIS UPPIS LIKE HERE AT THE BASE OF A MOUNTAIN AND YOU HAVE TO CLIMB TO THE TOP AND S WE HAVE TO FIND THE PATH HOWEVER SECURE  SECURED US TO GET YOU THERE IM BUT THERE REALLY IS A DISTANCE BETWEEN WHERE YOU BETWEEN YOUR STARTING POINT AND THE GOAL AND WHAT I'M ARGUING  ON THIS IS A KIND OF A NONDUEL IN TO USE A TERM OF JARGON IM IS A NON DUEL APPROACH TO MEDITATION II SUPPOSED TO A DUALISTIC ONE THAT THERE REALLY IS A A  THE PATH AND THE GOAL ARE ARE ARE COINCIDENT RIGHT THAT THERE'S A THE THAT YOU HAVE TO UNRAVEL THE LOGIC BY WHICH YOU WOULD SEEK SOMETHING THAT'S OUTSIDE OF U OF TH THE P THE PRESENT MOMENTS EXPERIENCS I'M YOU KNOW I  NOT AVAILABLE REALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO YOU NOW I'M BECAUS SO MANY THINGS WORTH HAVING SO MANY SO MANY SKILLS WORTH ACQUIRING REALLY ARE NOT AVAILABLE DO YOU NOW S LIKE US LIKE YOU KNOWIF YOU WANT TO BE A A PIANIST IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK CHINESE OR YO IT LIKE IT LIKE THE YOUTHERE'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW AND THENYOU WANT LEARN THAT THING AND THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS RIGHT AND YOU MIGHT NOT BE CAPABLE OF DOING IT IGT YOU MA AND AND REAL MASTERY IS FAR AWAY RIGT IF YOU IF YOU'VE NEVER HID A GOLF BALL AND YOU WANT TO HID A GOLF BALL THREE HUNDRED YARDS STRAIGHT RIGHT YOU' NOW I CAN PRETY MUCH GUARANTEE YOU'RE  NOT GOING TO DO THAT INITIALLY AND YU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT YOU KNOW ON DAY TO AND I YOU'RE NOT CN DO IT RELIABLY FOR THE LONGEST TIME AND THER'S REAL TRAINING YOU  IN FRONT OF YOU TO TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT RELIABLY AN INSIGHT YOUN TO AND REALY THE CORE INSIGHT YOU MEAN THAT THE INSIGHT THAT IS YOU THE CORES OF YOU ARE THE BUDDHEST TEACHING TO TAKE ONE ONE NA HISTORICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS I' REALLY IS AVAILABLE NOW AND IT IS NOT I MAY YUAVE GRANTED IT CAN BE VERY HARD ONE FOR PEOPLE AND I I HAD PROBABLY SPEND A YEAR ON SILENT RETREAT IN IN U ONE WEEK TO THREE MONTH INCEREMENTS BEFORE I SO I GOT THE POINT I'M MAKING NOW RIGHT SO LIKE I  IT'S IT'S QUITE A S I MAY LITERALLY IN THIS IS THE ASER YOU KNOW IS A RETREATS WREESPEND YOU' HAVE TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY JUST MEDITATING TRYING TO TO OU UNPACK THE KINDS OF CLAIMS I'M I'M N MAKING NOW I'M SO THERE I'S POT ITS IT'S POSSIBLE TO RIGOROUSLY OVERLOOK THIS IT'S POSSIBLE TO STAND IN FRONT OF THE MINDS I IMAGE AND STARE ING A WAY THAT IS GUARANTEED NOT TO GIVE YOU POP OUT RIGHT AND TO BE TO BE ADEPT AT BEING O STARING IN THAT WAY I'M SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE MISLED AND SO WHAT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO ARGUE HERE IS IF THERE IS I'M THRESTHE FAIR MAN OF LEVERAGE YOU CAN GET WITH WITH BETTER INFORMATION WHICH CAN CONCUT THE TIME COURSE OF YOUR SEARCHING FOR THIS THING AND AND AND CONCANCEL YOUR FALSE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT JUST WERE THIS IS IN RELATION TO YOUR ORDINARY WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS I'M AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET BAD IN FORMATION AND TO HAVE A BUNCH OF EXPERIENCES YOU KOW YOU GO T YOU GO AND DO AN I WOSKA TRIP AND YOU HAVE IT'S INCREDIBLY VALUABLE AND IT'S VALUABLE FOR ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH IT CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IN IN N A STARTLING WAYS AND YOU HAD INSIGHTS INTO YOUR PAST AND INTO YOUR RELATIONSHIPS AND INTO WY RE NOT AS LOVING AS YOU MIGHT BE AND I'S LOTS TO THINK ABOUT AND YOU' LIKE GET THIT'S ALL GREAT IT'S ALL SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOUWE CAN TALK ABOUT BUT THERE IS IT'S TRULY IS WORTH THOGNAL AN MIF IT MAKES A POINT OF CONTACT TO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IT'S RELY JUST AT ONE POINT YOU KNOW IN IT'S AT THE POINT WHERE THIS SENSE OF A SUBJECT OBJECT DI VISION IN CONSCIOUSNESS IS S ILLUCORY AND VULNERABLE TO INVESTIGATION AND IF YOU INVESTIGATE IT AS TOTHE THE RIGHT PLANE OF FOCUS YOU KNOW YOU PICK THE ANALOGY YOU WANT FROM YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW SETTING UP THE THE IM THE OPTIC BLIND SPOT EXPERIMENT IN JUST THE RIGHT WAY SO THA YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY NOT IN THE DATA'S NOT THERE OR IM MAD THE BY STABLE PERCEPTIS IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE ONE OF THESE IMAGES LIKE THE THE VASE FACE I DIAGRAM OR YOU KNOW THE DALMATION YOU KNOW THAT THIT LOOKS LIKE A JUST AMESS OF DOTS AND THEN YOU SEE THI THE IMAGE OF A DALMATION DOG POP OUT ONCE YOU SEE IT YOU REALLY CAN'T UNSEE IT AN ME YOLIKE ONCE YOU HAVE THE THE REQUISITE CONCEPTIOAL YOU OF ANCER TO IT THEN EVERY TIME YOU LOOK YOU CAN FIND IT AGAIN AND AND EVENTULLY BECOMES EFFORTLESS AND THAT'S WHAT ULTIMATELY MEDITATION IS A MTHIS KIND OF MEDITATION YOU YOU ULTIMATELY LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE'S NO SEPARATION FROM YOU BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR EXPERIENCE RIT THERE'S NOT THE EXPERIENCE ON THE ONE HAND AND THE SELF ON THE OTHER THERE'S JUST EXPERIENCE RIGHT THERE'S JUST SEENG HEARING SMELLING TASTE ING TOUCHING THINKING FEELING YOU APPROPRIACEPTION AD AD WHATEVER CHANNELS IN FORMATION YOU WANT TO THAT I BUT THERE'S JUST THE THERE'S JUST THE TOTALITY OF THE ENERGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS CONTENTS AND THERE'S NO IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE ON THE RIVER BANK AND THIS IS THIS IS HOW IT CAN SEEM IN THE BEGINNING EVEN WHEN YOU'RE PRACTISING MEDITATION FAIRLY DILIGENTLY CAN SEEM LIKE YOU'RE ON THE RIVER BANK WATCHING THE CONCTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS FLOW BY AND AND AND MEDITATION IS THE ACT OF DOING THAT MORE AND MORE DISPASSIONATELY SO YOU'RE NO LONGER GRABBING AT AT THE PLEASANT OR PUSHING THE UNPLEASANT AWAY YOURE JUST KIND OF RELAXING AND AN ND IN THE MOST NON JUDGEMENTAL FRAME OF MIND JUST WITNESSING THE FLOW RIGHT BUT IF YOU'RE DOING THAT DULISTICALLY YOU FEEL LIKE THE MEDITATOR YOU FEEL LIKE THE SUBJECT AIMING ATTENTION AND SO NOW YOU'RE ON THE RIVER BANK WATCHING EVERYTHING GO GO PAST BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU ARE THE RIVER RIGHT EXPERIENCE ITSELF IS THAT THERE IS JUST EXPERIENCE ITSELF YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT ON THE EDGE OF EXPERIENCE AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN NOTICE I'S PART OF TH OF THE FLOW RIGHT AND THERE'S AND THERE'S NO POINT FROM WHICH TO ABSTRACT YOURSELF AWAY FROM THE FLOW TO STAND OUTSIDE IT AND TO SAY OKAY THIS IS THIS IS MY LIFE THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE THIS IS MY BODY YES YOU CAN DO THAT AM IN THOSE ARE ALL JUST THOUGHTS BUT THES MORE OF THE FLOW RIGHT AND SO THERE IS A THERE'S A PROCESS BY WHICH YOU WOULD AVENGE EVENTUALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S NO DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR EXPERIENCE AND AGAIN YOU CAN YOU CAN WAIT FOR THOSE MOMENTS IN LIFE WHERE EXPERIENCE GETS SO GOOD OR SO TERRIFYING YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SOSALIENT RIGHT YOU'RE MIGDOLA IS DR AVING SO HARD AN MIS E OU'RE ININ A WAR AND YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING BECAUSE THERRE  YOU NOW THE ENEMY'S SHOOTING AT YOU AND THIS IS THE MOST THRILLING VIDIO GAME YOU'VE EVER PLAY IN YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LIFE IS ON THE LINE OR YOUR YOU'RE YOU NAR AT THE PEAK OF OF SOM YOU KNOW ATHELATIC EVANT WHERE THERE'S JUST YOU DO'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE DOING THE THINGS YOU'RE DOING BUT IT'S ALL HAPPENING AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT UM BUT YOU KNOW THOSE AR THOSE AR YOU DON'T ONE ONE HUNDREDTH OF ONE PER CENT OF ONE'S LIFE YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M CALLING MEDITATION IS A WAY OF SIMPLY UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANICS OF ATTENTION WHEREBY YOU ARE DENYING YOURSELF THAT UNITY OF EXPERIENCE SO MUCH OF THE TIME AND RECOGNIZING THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BASED ON A A MISPERCEPTION OF THE WAY CONSCIOUSNESS ALWAYS ALREADY IS IF THERE WASN'T AN INSENTIVE TO LEARN HOW TO MEDITATE PROPERLY UM THAT WAS ONE AND I'VE BEEN MEDITATING A FAIR AMOUNT SINCE I WAS IN MY TEENS I BUT MORE ALONG THE LINES OF JUSPAING ATTENTION TO BREATH AN UM YOU RECOGNIZE THOUGHT SORT OF OBSERVER OPEN OBSERVER TIGHT MEDITATION AND OR FOCUS ATTENTION I WOULDSUPPOSE MORE OF THE FOCUS ATTENTION TYPE WILL GET INTO THESE ELIBIT LAYER BUT HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RELAYE TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID SUR UM I LOVE THE IDEA THAT THIS THING THAT UM WE WOULD ALL DO WELL TO UNDERSTAND TO OBSERVE CONSCIOUSNES IT SELF AS SOPPOSED TO UM TRYG TO ALTER THE CONSTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS UM MAY SIT MUCH CLOSER TO US THEN UM ONE MIGHT THINK THAT IT U AND THAT BECAUSE IT SIT SO CLOSE TO US THAT HAT MIGHT BE ONE O THE REASONS WHY WE MIST IT II GO RIGHT TO OVISIAL SYSTEM A EXAMPLE OF IF YOU DON'T YOU WEARING A CORRECTIVE LENSES IN THERE'S ASPECT ON YOUR LENS YOU KNOW SIMPLE YOUR LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE LENS AND SEVERYONE T OBSERVE THAT SPECK UM ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ANALOGIES COULD WORK HERE THE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE STATES HOWEVER FEW UM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ECSTASY Y EXTREME ECSTASY AN EXTREME FEAR I BEING THAT THE TWO I THINK MOST OBVIOUS ONES THAT SEEMS LIKE WE AGREE ON THAT ALLOW US TO CAPTUR THE SENSE OF UM COMPLETENESS OF SELF WERE THE THE UNITY OF  THE OBSERVER AN THE AND THE ACTOR UM THE FACT THAT THOSE ARE ARE SELDOM FOR THE NON TRAINED FOR THE NON MEDITATOR UM SUGGESTS TO ME TWO THINGS I THINK ONE UM PERHAPS WORTH EXPLORING MORE THAN THE OTHER BUT ONE IS THAT UM WHAT'S REALLY BEING REVEALED IN THE STATES WHERE WE CAN FEEL THE UNITY OF THE OBSERVER IN THE ACTOR IS UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE ALGARITHM NOT THE ON LINE ALGRTHEM BUT THE ALGRTHEM THAT IS OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST AS A YOU MENTION SEPHLOPOSAME MENTO SHRIM SEE AN ENORMOUS SARRAY OF COLOR HUES THAT WE DON'T RIGHT THERE MAP THERE MAPS AND REPRESENTATIONS THE WORLD ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PIT VIPER SEE IN TE INFORVED WEE RESTRICTED TO SEM WHAT OF A LIMITED RANGEMENT IN THE COLER SPECTRUM BUT STILL MORE VAST THAN THAT OF DOGS OR CATS O K SO UNDERSTANDING THAT FOR SEEN WHAT UM A PITBIPER CAN SEE FOR MOMENTS WOULD BE INFORMATIVE UM PERHAPS IM SENSING HEATOMISSIONS AAS A HUMAN MIGHT BE INVASIVE A MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE DON'T DO IT SO THE QUESTION IS TO JUST MAKE IT STRAIGHT FOR IT IS UM WHY WOULD THE SYSTEM BE DESIGN THIS WAY AGAIN NEITHER OF US WERE CONSULTED THE DESIGN PHASE BUT THAT BRINGS ME TO PERHAPS THE MORE TRACTABLE QUESTION WAS WHICH IS M ABOUT DEVELOPMENT I I MAY GREAT BELIEVER THAT THE NERL CIRCUITS THAT I ENCOURAGED A HEALTHY PARENT CHILD RELATIONS OR UNHEALTHY PARENT CHILD RELATIONS AS THE CASE MAY BE E CHILDIDS TEM FROM THE INITIAL DEMANDS OF INTERNAL VERS'S EXTERNAL STATES WHICH IS EXACTLY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THAT A A YOUNG CHILD FEELS ANXIOUS BECAUSE IT NEDS ITS DIPER CHANGE IS DOESN'T REALLY KNOW IT NEEDS ITS DIPER CHANGE OR IT'S COLD WHER IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE OR IT'S HUNGRY WOR IT'S OVERLY FULL AND SO IT VOCALIZES AND THEN SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE COMES TO US AND RELIEVES THAT HOPEFULLY I AND SO THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE THAT WE FIRST LEARN IS NOT THAT WE HAVE A SELL FOR THAT UM THINGS FALL DOWN NOT UP BUT IS THAT IM WHEN UNCOMFORTABLE UM EXTERNALIZE THAT DISCOMFORT AND IT WILL BE RELIEVED BY AN OUTSIDE PLAYER AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A REPURPOSING OF THAT CIRCUITRY FOR ADULT ROMANTIC ATTACHMENTS I DON'T THINK ANY ONE DOUBTS THAT AND THI CAN EXPLAIN A LOT INDEED ABOUT ATTACHMENT AND SO FORTH SO SOMETHING ABOUT OUR DEVELOPMENTAL WIRING AND THE ALGARYTHMS THAT THESE NERAL CIRCUITS RUN TEND TO BUYAS MOST PEOPLE THE NON PRACTISE MEDITATORS TO LIVE AT SOMEWHAT FUNCTIONAL LIFE AT LEAST UM WITHOUT THIS AWARENESS OF ACTOR AN OBSERVER AND SO WHAT YOU'REREALLY TALKING ABOUT IS AT IT DELIBERATE INTERVENTION TO UNDERSTAND AND RESOLVE THAT GAP AN THE ALGARITM IS THAT DO I HAVE TAT RIGHT I MA MORE LESS RESTATING WE SAID IN A WAY THAT I'M I HOPING WILL SERVE AS A JUMPING OFF POINT IS YOU KNOW WHY QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS VERY DANGEROUS IN MIOLOGY WERE ANY  NO A AND UNRELATION WHAT'S THAT OR IN RELATION ORE IN RELATION RIGHT EXACTLY UM ALTHOUG I THINK IT ALL DOES REALLY HORCAN ACK TO THIS EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL WIRING WHICH OF COURSE IS MODIFIABLE THAT'S THE THAT'S A BEAUTY OF OF THE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ITS THE ONE ORGAN THAT SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE ISELF AT LEAST TO SOME DEGREE UM SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCUITRY TO TESSENTIALLY UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS TO NOT REVEAL IT'S WHAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF ITS MORE IMPORTANT AND PROFOUND AND UM FOR YOU DARE I SAY ENLIGHTENING FEATURES I ALMOST AS IF WE ARE POTENTIALLY LIKE MANTIS SHRIMP WE CAN SEE SO MANY MORE COLORS THAN WE ACTUALLY SEE AND YET WE DON'T WE WE SERVE OP MOST PEOPLE OUGHT NOT TO AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT UM ONE OF THE GREAT STRENGTHS OF THE WAKING UP AP FOR INCES THAT IT IT SINCILY WALKS YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO ARRIVE AT THESE SCENES WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO ONE YEAR OR THREE YEAR U LONG SOLENLIATION RETREATS   SO YEOU JUST ELABORATE FOR A MOMEN BEFORE WE MEVE GONE ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THE CIRCUITRY IS ARRANGED BY DEFAULT VERSES THAT THE AN AN WHAT THAT MEANS UM FOR THERE TO BE T AN N INTERVENTION THAT WE HAVE TO INTERVENE IN THE SELF IN ORDER TO REVEAL THE SELF WALL SO THAT TO BIG QUESTIONS THERE  ONE ABOUT EVOLUTION ONE ABOUT DEVELOPMENT SO I WITH RESPECT TO EVOLUTION AMI IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVOLUTION DOESN'T SEE ARE DEEPEST CONCERNS ABOUT HUMAN FLOURISHING AND HUMAN WELL BENG YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THE AUL IT'S JUST ING NOW YOUU WE ARE SET UP TO SPAWN AND TO SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH TO TO HELP OUR PROGENY SPAWND IF WE CAN DO THAT AND THAT AND THAT THAT'S IT RIGHT AND SO ANYTHING THAT WAS GOOD FOR THAT INCLUDING YOU KNOW ATRIBALISM AND ZENOPHOBIA AND YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF HARD WOREING SAW WEREFLAWS THAT ARE THAT AR REVEAL THEMSELVES TO BEFLAS IN THE PRESENT TIME WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A VIABLE GLOBAL CIVILIZATION  BUT YOU KNOW THEY THEY REDOUNDED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF OUR ANCESTORS SOMEHOW IMWERE THEY JUST THERES THEIR THINGS ABOUT US THAT WERE SIMPLY NOT SELECTED FOR THAT JUST COMING CAME ALONG FOR THE RIDE YOU KNOW TH YOU KNOW WHAT STEPHEN JACEL CALLED A SPANDREL YOU KNOW M SO A WE ARE NOT SET UP BY EVOLUTION TO BE AS HAPPY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN BE I'M AND CERTAINLY AN AND TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING THAT INTERESTS US WELL AND WE WE'RE NOT SET UP BY EVOLUTION TO BE MATHEMATICIANS OR MUSICIANS OR TO TO CREATE DEMOCRACIES THAT ARE HEALTHY I MINTON EVOLUTION CAN SEE NONE OF THIS AND WE ARE DOING THESE THINGS BASED ON COGNATIVE AN EMOTIONAL HARDWARE A THAT WE ARE LEVERGINE IN NEW DIRECTIONS RIGHT N THAT WE HAVE WE ARE PRIMATES AND WE ARE YOU KNOW WERE COMMUNICATING WITH UN A SMALL MOUTH NOISESAND WE WERE LANGUAGE USING PRIMATES AN ALL OF THAT IS CLEARLY EVOLVED IM AND WE'RE DOING THESE AMAZING THINGS INCLUDING SCIENCE YOU KNOW HOWEVER IMPROBABLY WERE YOU WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO TO YOU KNOW ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH LANGUAGE I UNDERSTAND REALITY THAT AT A SCALE THAT EXCEEDS US IN BOTH DIRECTIONS  MAN THAT THE VERY THE VERY VAST AND THE VERY SMALL AND AND YOU ALSO TEMPERALLY THE VERY OLD  WE HAVE YOU KNOW VISIONS OF THE FAR FUTURE WE CAN FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHERE AN AOU AN ASTEROID IS GOING TO IN A CROSS EARTH'S OR BIT A THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW I IF WE JUST DO THE MATH AND IT IS MA EASING THAT WE CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS BUT EVOLUTION IS BLIND TO AL OF THAT RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE OU TERMS OF WHAT WE CARE ABOUT AND CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WHAT'S GOING TO INSURE OUR SURVIVAL OF A SPECIES WE HAVE FLOWN THE PERCH THAT WAS CREATED FOR US BY EVOLUTION AND ME WE'RE JUST NOT IT'S NOT JUST THE PRIMATE THINGS AND SO SO IT IS WITH LEARNING HOW TO REGULATE OUR EMOTIONS AND AND YOU KNOW PUNCH THROUGH TO A SELF CONCEPT ERE BEYOND A SELF CONCEPT THAT IS MORE NORMATIVE PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT ALLOWS US TO YOU KNOW NOT BE  TERRORIZED BY OUR APISH GENES A AS FULLY AS WE SEEM TO BE EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF MORE AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY THAT IMLILY YOU KNOW WERE WE'RE STILL PRACTICALLY CHIMPANSES ARMED WITH NEWCLIER WEAPONS RIGHT AND TND THAT IS YU KNOW INCREASINGLY DISFUNCTIONAL AND A VERY SOON WERE CAN BE IN THE PRESENCE OF MINDS OR APPARENT MINDS THAT WE HAVE BUILT YOU KNOW THAT ARE AS INTELLIGENT AS WE ARE OR AND VERY QUICKLY YOU KNOW PROBABLY FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER THAT FAR MORE INTELLIGENT THAN WE ARE AND SO WHAT WE DO WITH ALL OF THAT IS AGAIN SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT BASED ON THE MINDS WE HAVE THE MINDS WE CAN BUILD THE MINDS WE CAN  CHANGE YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN MEDDLE WITH OUR OWN GENOMES NOW AND AND THAT WILL PRODUCE ITS OWN CONSEQUENCES A YOU KNOW I IUN IN OURSELVES AND I IN FUTURE GENERATIONS IF WE MEDDLE WITH THE GERM LINE AND AGAIN ALL OF THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW YOU KNOW EVOLUTION IS JUST FOR THE WOMB WE CAME OUT OF BUT IT'S NOT IT DIDN'T ANTICIPATE ANY OF THAT RIGHT  SO SO THAT YOU KNOW MOTHER NATURE HAS HAS SIMPLY NOT HAD OUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART RIGHT AND IS I WE MIGHT DIE OFF AND AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MOTHER NATURE THAT'S THAT'S FINE BECAUSE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF IT OF EVERY SPECIES DIES OFF YOU KNOW A SO THERE'S THAT WHAT BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING T WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THE INDIVIDUAL DEVELOP MENTALLY SO YO NOW WE ALL COME INTO THIS WORLD AGAIN AS A AS SAY A FAIRLY HAIRILOUS PRIMATE A THAT NEEDS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CARE BY OTHERS AND A THE LOGIC OF THAT IS THAT A YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY WE'RE NOT A IT GAZELLE THAT CAN  RUN YOU KNOW FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER D THAN BASICALLY DO ALL THE GAZELLE THINGS A PERFECTLY A SOON THEREAFTER A THE REASON WHY WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS THIS TIME OF OF IMMATURITY A AND THAT BECOMES HAS BECOME FUNCTIONAL FOR US IS IT IT ITS JUST WE WERE WERE FAR D MORE FLEXIBLE AND WE CAN LEARN BASED ON THE NEEDS OF OF AN ENVIRONMENTS TO DO YOU KNOW IS SO MUCH MORE THAN A GAZELLE CAN AND LANGUAGE IS PART OF THAT AND YOU KNOW A IN THE LAST TEN THOUSAND YEARS OR SO CULTURE INCREASINGLY HAS BEEN MORE AND MORE PART OF THAT AND THERE'S A PROBALY A L AIR AT WHICH WE CAN PLAUSIBLY TALK ABOUT CULTURAL EVOLUTION YOU KNOW A AN CULTURE EVOLUTION INTERACTING WITH BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION TO TO CHANGE US AM WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDIVIDUAL EACH OF US COMES INTO THIS WORLD I THINK AM NOT RECOGNIZING OURSELVES IN ANY IN ANY SENSE THAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TO REALFY AM MIT'S NOT THAT THERE'S NOTHING THERE MN COULD BE SOME KIND OF PROTO SELF DIFFERENTIATION BUT I THINK IT'S IT TAKES O IT TAKES A LONG WHILE AND THERE IS PROT VERY LIKELY A COINCIDENCE BETWEEN REALLY RECOGNIZE RECOGNIZING OTHERS WE RECOGNIZE OTHERS FIRST AND WE WEARE IN CERTAINLY IN RELATIONSHIP IMMEDIATELY AND WE WORRI INTO HUMAN FACES AND AND WE I OU EVEN DETECT A OTHER HUMANS AS GOOD AND BAD MORAL ACTORS VERY EARLY A CERTAINLY LONG BEFORE WE RECOGNIZE OURSELVES AN IN A MIRROR A A WE AM THE EXPERIMENTS RUN AGAINST AS PAUL BLOOM AND AND COLLEGUES EEXPERIMENTS RUN ON COUNT OF THE MORAL HARDWARE O AND SA AFWARE OF OF A DEVELOPING TODDLERS BUT I THINK THIS POINT THEY PUSH IT DOWN ALL THE IT LIKE SIX MONTHS OF OF AGE WHERE YOU'LL GET THESE INFANTS STARING AT OUT OF A PUPPET SHOW AND DEL THE'LL SHOW A AN AAM A GREATER INTEREST IN IN A IN A CLASSICALLY GOOD ACTORS VERSEAS BAD ACTORS YOUR COOPERATORS VERSES YOU KNOW DEFECTORS IN VARIOUS IN O PUPPASHOW GAMES AM SO THERE'S IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE NO MIND AND NO A PROTO AWARENESS OF OTHERS AND AND OF SELF BUT WHAT EVENTUALLY HAPPENS CERTAINLY AS WE BECOME AT ALL FASCIL WITH WITH LANGUAGE USE IS THAT WE BECOME AWARE THAT THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE IN RELATIONSHIP TO OTHERS BUT WE ARE AN OBJECT IN THE WORLD FOR THEM RIGT SO THAT LIKE WE HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE POINTING AT US IN OUR CRIBS RIGHT AND IMPINGING UPON OUR EXPERIENCE WRIGHT NEATHE YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE BEING PHYSICALLY MOVED AND PRODDED AND TOUCHED AND CONSOLED OR NOT CONSOLED AND JUST IMAGINE WHAT ALL OF THESE R ON THE RECEIVING END OF TEN THOUSAND INTERVENTIONS RIHT AND YOU'RE COMPLETELY HELPLESS FOR THE LONGEST TIME A AT ALL OF THAT ATTENTION YOU HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE COMING UP YOU KNOW TO THE CRIB AND AND MAKING FACES AT YOU CHEERING YET AND AD IT'S ALL POINTED AT YOU WRITES OTHERS DAY YOU KNOW IS  CLASSIC MAGICAL NNARCICISM THAT THAT GETS CONSTRUCTED THERE IF YOU IF YOU TAKE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE IN  AT LEAST A CERTAIN STRAND OF IT SERIOUSLY AM AND I THINK IT'S ITS LARGELY APT TO TO THINK OF OF A CHILD OF THAT AGE AS A KIND A KIND OF FAM A THERE 'S A KIND OF NNARCISISTIC STRUCTURE THERE WHERE IT'S IT'S IT'S ALL KIND OF GOING INWARD AND AT A CERTAIN POINT YOUE REALIZE OK I'M I'M THE CENTRE ALL OF THIS RIGHT LIKE IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST A A MOVY THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE T YOU'RE COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN AND YOU'VE LOST YOUR SENSE OF SELF AND THIS IS O TALK OFTTHE YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A OF WHAT IS LIKE AS A GROWN UP TO LOSE OUR SENSE OF SELF AND ONE OF THINGS O THING WE FIND SO FASCINATING BY ABOUT TELEVITION AND AND FILM IS THAT WHEN WE GET TOTALLY ABSORBED IN IT WE'RE IN THIS VERY UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE'RE YOU KNOW OUR BRAIN IS BASICALLY READING IT AS WEARINESS IN THE CLASSIC SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCE WERE PRESENTED WITH WITH YOU KNOW THE THE FACIAL DISPLAYS OF OTHER PEOPLE IN FACT WITE A WEANGET THAT SOME OF THAT SOMETIMES THASE PEOPLE ARE TEN FEET TALL RIGHT OR THEIRE FACES ARE TEN FEET ALL A CLOSE UP IN A MOVI THEATRE SOC'S LIKE THI SUPERSTIMULUS YET INTERMS OF AO EVOLUTION AND THEY COULD MAKE THEY CON BE MAKING DIRECT EYE CONTACT WITH THA CAMERA RIGHTLY YOU HAVE THE GIGANTIC FACE STARING AT YOU AND YET YOU'RE TOTALLY UNIMPLICATED SOCIALLY YOU CAN'T BE SEEN AND YOU AND SOMETHING ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BE SEEN AND SO YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOU COMPLETELY LOSE SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AND YET YOU'RE YOU'RE ABLE TO EXAMINE WITH COMPLETELY FREE ATTENTION AGAIN CAUSE YOU'RE TOTALLY UNIMPLICATED A THE THE E FACIAL MINUSIA AND THE METIC FACIAL PLAY OF PEOPLE A FROM IF AT A VERY CLOSE RANGE AND YOURE SEEING PEOPLE CLOET ME OU'D HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW PHYSICALLY JUST YOU'AVE ABOUT TO KISS YOUR YOUR YOUR SPOUSE LIKE THAT'S WHAT A CLOSE UP IS IN A FILM RIGHT LIKE THAT YOU' NEVER GET THAT CLOSE TO PEOPLE RIGHT  AND YET HER YOUR IN SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE UNOBSERVED AND YOU KNOW THAT AND SO THIS THAT OVE ATTANGION BUT THE IT'S IT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING DEVELOPMENTALLY FOR A KID A WHEN YOU'E IN A MOVIG THEATRE WATCHING A MOVY YOU ARE TRULY INVISIBLE AND YET YOU'RE RIGHT THERE SEEING OU NOF THE HOWEVER HARROWING THE HUMAN DRAMA IS YOU'RE EEN TO PLAY OUT N YOU'RE SEEN AT YOUYOU'RE SEEIN IT UP CLOSE AND IT IS A IT IS INPRINCIPALLY SOCIAL ENCOUNTER THAT YOU'R GENES ARE READY FOR BUT THEY'RE NOT READY FOR YOU TO BE INVISIBLE RIGHT AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S SO A MAGICAL ABOUT IT BUT WHAT HAPPENS DEVELOPMENTALLY FOR A KID IS THAT YOU'RE NOT INVISIBLE YOU ARE AN OBJECT THAT IS CONSTANTLY BEING BEING AM OVERRUN THE BOUNDARIES OF YOURE YOU KNOW U YOUYOU'RE CENSORY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WORLD ARE CONSTANTLY BEING IMPINGED UPON BY OTHERS AND AT A CERTAIN POINT YOURE RECOGNIZE OK I'M AT THE CENTRE OF THIS AND THE AND THE WAY THIS GETS IN SHRINED AS A SELF A I THINK IT'S PROBABLY COINCIDENT WITH ARE LEARNING THE LANGUAGE GAME WE WE LEARNED TO PLAY WITH OTHERS WERE WE WE'RE TALKING TO OTHERS PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO US AND AT A CERTAIN POINT WE'RE TALKING TO OUR ELVES EVEN WHEN THEY OTHER PEOPLE LEAVE THE ROOM RIGHT SAYIND YOU CAN HEAR I IF YOU EVER HAVE BEEN WITH A TODTLER WHEN THEY'RE  WHEN THERE WHEN THEY'RE EXTERNALIZING THEIR SELF TALK YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THEM TALKING TO THEMSELVES ARE PLAYING AND THEIR AND THEI'R THERE HAVEN'T A CONVERSATION THAT THEY WERE TALKING TO YOU THE PARENT BUT THEN YOU LEFT THE ROOM AND AND THERE STILL TALKING YOU COME BACK GAIN THAND THERE STILL THERE STILL TALKING RIGHT AND WHAT HAPPENS TO US STRANGELY I AND THIS COMES BACK TO THE LOGIC OF EVOLUTION I WE NEVER STOP BECAUSE OUGHTT EVOLUTION NEVER THOUGHT TO BUILD US AN OFFSWITCH FOR THIS RIGHT AMIDLANGUAGE IS SO USEFUL AND HIT GETS TUNED UP SO STRONGLY FOR US IAND THRE WAS NEVER REASON TO SHUT IT OFF RIGH THERE'S NOVER REASON TO GIVE YOU THIS ABILITY IS IGE WOULDN'T BE NICE OF FOUR HOURS OF QUIET NOW  LIKE NO SELF TALK A AND SO FOR MOST OF US AND MI THIK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO FOR WHATEVER NEUROLOGICAL REASON OR YOU KNOW IT ISNENCRATIC REASON UNDOUBTEDLY THERE'S  BE A NERLOGICAL REASON FOR IT DON'T HAVE ANY SELF TALK BUT FOR THE FOR MOST OF US I WE ARE COVERTLY TALKING BASICALY ALL THE TIME AND AND IRE'S AN IMMAGISTIC COMPONENT OF THIS FOR MANY PEOPLE YOU'R YOU'R VISUALIZING THINGS AS WELL BUT THERE JUST A LOT O TON OF WHITE NOISE IN THE MIND THAT FEELS A CERTAIN WAY AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WHAT YOU DISCOVER IN MEDITATION ULTIMATELY IS THAT THE SELF IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE THINKING WITHOUT KNOWING THAT YOU'RE THINKING RGHT A THOUGHT ARISES UNINSPECTED AND SEEMS TO JUST BECOME YOU RHT SO LIKE A YOU AND OURE TALKING NOW AND YOU SAT YOUR PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO US THEY'RE THERE STRUGGLING TO FOLLOW THE TRAIN OF THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT IS COMPETING WITH THETHE CONVERSATION AS HAPPENING IN THEIR HEADS RIGHT SO THAT ALL BE SAYING SOMETHING AND A PERSON LISTENING WILL SAY WELL WHAT DOS THAT MEAN OR LIKE OBEYT HOM HE JUST CONTRADICTED HIMSELF OR LIKE TE  YOU'RE AND THERE'S A VOICE IN YOUR HEAD THAT IS ALSO VYING FOR YOUR ATTENTION MUCH OF THE TIME AND I SO IT'S YOU THE FIRST DISCOVERY PEOPLE MAKING MEDITATIONS THAT IT'S JUST SO HARD TO PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THE BREATH OR MONTRA OR T SO WHATEVER IT IS BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING EVERY YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE THING YOU NEED TO DO IN AN HOUR AND ALL IT'S SO GOOD THAT I O DOWNLOATED THI SAP UNTO LIKE THIS IS REALLY GOOD IS TN BE GOOD FOR ME BUTAND YOU'RE BUT YOUR HATHAT CHATTER ISN'T SHOWING UP YOU'RE NOT FAR BACK ENOUGH I YIN THE IN THE N OF THE THEATERE OF CONSCIOUSNESS SO AS TO SEE IT EMERGE IS IT IS JUST SNEAKING UP BEHIND YOU AND IT FEELS LIKE ME AGAIN OR IT FEELS LIKE WHEN SOME ONE IS THINKING THE THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN RIGHT THE'RE NOT SEEING IT AS AN EMERGING OBJECT AND CONSCIOUSNESS IT JUST FEELS LIKE ME IT JUST FEEL THAT THAT THAT'S IT IS IT THEM THE YOU SUBJECTIVELY IT'S LIKE THE MIND CONTRACTS AROUND THIS APPEARANCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND IT REALLY IS JUST IT IS JUST IC YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A SOUND WITH THE VOICE OF THE MIND IF YOU ACTUALLY CAN INSPECT IT IT IS IT IS DEEPLY INSCRUTABLE THAT WE EVER FEEL IDENTIFIED WITH OUR THOUGHTS ME HOW IS IT THAT WE COULD BE A THOUGHT THES THOUGHTS THAT THOUGHT JUST ARISES AND PASSES AWAY AND WHEN YOU INSPECT THA WHN YOU GO TO INSPECT IT IT'S IT YOU KNOW IT UNRAVELS IT'S IT'S  IT'S IT'S IT'S THE LEAST SUBSTANTIAL POSSIBLE THING AND AND IT COULD BUT YET IT COULD BE A THOUGHT OF SELF HATRED YU KNW COULD BE A  THOUGHT THAT TIT UNRECOGNIZED TOTALLY DEFINES YOURE YOUR MOOD YOU NOST LIKE UM ME JUST AAGAIN THIS ALL CON SEEM KIND OF ABSTRACT BUT WE'LL KNOW TAT IBUT I THINK IT ITS EXTREMELY CONCRETE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NARROW CIRCUITS THAT WILL RETURN TO IN A MAYBE IN A FEW MINUTES IF YOU COULD ELABORATE A BIT ON THIS NOTION OF INTERNAL CHATTER AND EXTERNAL STIMULLY AND THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THEM COSETTS I THINK THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE INTO ITIVE I THINK FOR OTHERS UM IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS THAT UM LANGUAGE IT'S ON GOING IT RY BACKTROM AT IS SOMETIMES I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE TUNED INTO UM THAT LANGUAGE FOR SOME PEOPLE AT'S ITS LOUDER VOLUME FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S AMORE STRUCTURED I AVE A COLLEAGUE AT UM HAT STAMFORD HAS BEEN ON THIS PODGASS CALLED DICER AUTH IS A LITLE AN THE PREMA LIKE BY WHENGH YOU S ELSE PSYCHITRISE AND HE HAS A MAT HE DOESN'T CALL ITO MEDITATIVE PRACTICY AS A PRACTICEOR EACH EVENING AFTER IS FIVE KIDS AR DOWN ASLEEP YOU KNOW M THEY'RE OLDER NOW BUT A AND IN THE QUIET OF THAT THE LATE HOURS OF THE NIGHT EARLY MORNING HE SITS AND FORCES HIMSELF TO THINK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES WITH PUNCTUATION FOR AN HOUR IS IS THE WAY THAT HE AS TAUGHT HIMSELF TO STRUCTURE HIS THINKING BECAUSE OF THE VERY FACT THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHICH IS HAT ORDINARILY THERE IS AN UNDERLYING STRUCTURE TO WHAT'S INTERNAL BUT IT'S DESTRUCTED BY EXTERNAL EVENTS AND ITS AND THESE ARE IT ANTIPICALLY IT'S NOT UM COHERENT ENOUGH TO REALLY MAKE MEANING FROM SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOMEBODY SING DOWN TO WRITE IN COMPLETE SENTENCES BUT FORCING HIMSELF TO DO IT IN HIS HEAD BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE IN CLEAN MYSELF THAT'S AT THAT'S A FOREIGN EXPERIENCE AND WE ONLY EXPERIENCE STRUCTURE THROUGH OUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE WORLD AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT IF I WERE I TAKEN THE TIME TO TRY AN EXPLORE IDEAS WITH EYES CLOSED AND YOU NARE NO BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT UM THERE CERTAIN PHORMICALOGIC STATES TAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT FACILITATE THAT UAND KNOW THOSE ARE NOT IMFET A MEANS THOSE DO EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE MY THE  BUT UM I THINK PEOPLE EXIST IN VARYING DEGREES OF STRUCTURED AND EX AND UNSTRUCTURED INTERNAL DIALOGUE AND UM INV IN VERYING DEPTHS OF RECOGNITION OF THAT INTERNAL DIALOGUE AND HO OR THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS IS JUST THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS AN A DIALOGUE ON GOING INTERNALLY IS THAT ITSELF VALUABLE YE AND THAT  THAT ALSO CAN TAKE SOME TIME SO SO SEHERE IT HERE'S HA CLAIM I WOULD MAKE THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FIND SURPRISING BUT I THINK THIS IS AN OBJECTIVELY TRUE CLAIM ABOUT THE SUBJECTIVITY OF MOST PEOPLE WHICH IS THAT UNLESS YOU YOU  HAVE A FAIR MOUNT OF TRAIN LET US HERE JUST HAPPEN TO BE SOME KIND OF SAVANT IN THIS AREA WHICH BEN ALMOST PEOPLE BY DEFINITION AREN'T IOR YOU HAVE A REMARKABLE AMOUNT OF TRAINING IN WHAT'S CALLED IN CONCENTRATION PRACTICE AND IN MEDITATION I'M I THINK I BELIEVE THIS IS A A TRUE CLAIM THAT YOU KNO IF WE JUST YO PUT A A STOP WATCH ON THIS TABLE AND AND YOU A PEOPLE COULD JUST WATCH IT OU OF THE THIRTY SECONDS ELAPSE AND I'M I SET YOU KNOW SET ALL OF OUR LISTENERS OR YOUR VIEWERS THE TASK I FOR THE NEXT THIRTY SECONDS JUST PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING YOUR BREATH YOU KNOW OR YOU KNOW THE  F THE SIGHT OF YOUR HAND OR THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK OR I ANY OBJECT WITHOUT GETTING LOST IN THOUGHT WITHOUT GETTING MOMENTARILY DISTRACTED BY THIS CONVERSATION YOUR HAVING WITH YOURSELF I'M THIS COUPLE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN ONE IS NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT RIGHT AND AND AND NOT JUST THIS IS NOT JUST A A SUPERFICIAL INABILL OFTAME IF YOUR LIFES DEPENDED ON IT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT AND IF IF THE FATE OF CIVILIZATION DEPENDED ON IT NONE OF NONE OF OUR LISTENERS WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS I'M AND YET SOME PERCENTAGE OF THEM AR ARE SO DISTRACTED BY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD THINK TAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY TRY THIS EXPERIMENT AND THINK THEY SUCCEEDED RIGHT AND FOR THESE PEOPLE WHAT AT WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU PUT THEM ON A MEDITATION RETREAT AND YOU HAVE THEM SPEND TWELVE HOURS O DAY IN SILENCE DOING NOTHING BUT THIS RIGTS OF THE PRACTICE IS JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE BREATH WHEN THEI'RE SITTING AND THEN EVENTUALLY AT YOU INCORPORATE EVERYTHING SOUNDS AND OTHER SENSATIONS AND THEN YOU INTERLEVE THAT WITH WALKING MEDITATION WETH THEIR PAIN ATTENTION JUST TOF THE SENSATIONS OF LIFTING AND MOVING AND PLACING THEIR FEET AND THEN YOU KNOW ONCE THE PRACTICE IS GOING YOU INCORPORATE SOUNDS AND SIGHTS IN EVERYTHING BUT SYOU CN PAY ATTENTION EVERYTHING BUT THE GOAL IS FOR EVERY MOMENT IM YOU ARE GOING TO YOU WERE GOING TO CULTIVATE THAT WHAT THIS THI FACULTY OF MIND WHICH YOU INCREASINGLY IS KNOWN AS MINDFULNESS RIGHTS SO AND MINDFULNESS IS NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS VERY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE CONTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS  BUT THE CRUCIAL PEACE IS IT IS NOT A MOMENT OF BEING LOST IN THOUGHT RIGHT YOU'RE NOT YOU YOU'RE NOT BLOCKING THOUGHTS THOUGHTS THEMSELVES CAN ARISE BUT IN THOSE MOMENTS OF BEING TRULY MINDFUL YOURE NOTICING THOUGHTS AS THOUGHTS WHETHER THERE WHETHER IT'S LANGUAGE IN THE MIND OR IMAGES YOU'RE NOTICING THOSE TWO AS PO NTANEOUS APPEARANCES IN CONSCIOUSNESS  SO I IF IF MOSE PEOPLE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY ANY ONE WHO THINKS THEY CAN PAY ATTENTION TO YOU KNOW TO   CAN DO THE EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFULLY THAT I JUST A SUGGESTED PAY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING FOR THIRTY SECONDS WITHOUT BEING LOST IN THOUGHT YOU PUT THOSE PEOPLE ON IN MEDITATION RETREAT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE IS AND ON THE FIRST DAY THEY'REGOING TO FEEL LIKE ALL YET I WAS YOU KNOW I WAS WITH THE BREATH OR I WAS WALK YOU KNOW AS WITH THE SENSATIONS OF WALKING AND I BE THEREFOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES YOU KNOW SOLID AND THEN I WOULD GET LOST IN THOUGHT I COME BACK I FIVE MORE MEN UTE TO BE LOST IN THOUGHT AN GET BACKBUT AS THE DAYIS PROGRESS YOU KNOW EVEN YOU KNOW TEN DAYS IN TO A SILENT MEDITATION RETREAT THEY ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE MORE AND MORE DISTRACTION THEYR GONGT ITS CIN A SEEM LIKE IL CAY AWAIT A MINUTE NOW I CAN'T PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING FOR MORE THAN FIVE SECONDS RIGHT ITHAT IS PROGRESS RIGHT BECAUSE  WHAT THEY'RE DISCOVERING IS JUST HOW DISTRACTABLE THEY ARE RIGHT AND IM YOU KNOW SO SOMETIT FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT WILL BE IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS FOR SOME PEOPLE IT ILLECTUALLY TAKE A A LOT OF PRACTICE TO REALIZE JUST HOW DISTRACTED THERE WHAT YOU JUST SAID WHICH WAS THAT AT SOME POINT AM WE CAN START NOTICING OUR THOUGHTS I CAN NOTICE MY THOUGHTS BUT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IS AS A GOAL STATE IS NOT AM IS NOT BEING DISTRACTED BY THOUGHTS BUT ASHALLY SEEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOUGHTS SEULF AND OTHER TYPES OF PERCEPTIONS AND HERE I THINK RECOGNIZING AND SEEN THOUGHTS IS A FORM OF PERCEPTION IS JUST AN ENTIRELY DIRECTOD PERCEPTION THIS RAISES A A TOPIC THAT AM A'M ALSO OBSESSED BY WHICH I THINK NERAL SCIENCE CAN SOMEWHAT EXPLAIN BUT STILL INCOMPLETE AM INCOMPLETELY THAT I THE CIRCUITS OF MECHANICS AT CETERA ARE NOT AM YET KNOWN WHICH IS ABOUT TIME PERCEPTION AND YOU KNOW  A SIMPLE ANALOGY WOULD BE THAT UM THERE ARE LOT OF A SMALL OBJECTS FLYING AROUND IN THE SPACE THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION BUT THEIRE MOVING SO FAST THAT I CAN'T PERCEIVE THEM WHERE THERE ENTIRELY STATIONARY SO I CAN'T PERCEIVE THEM BECAUSE OF THE REASONS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM MY EYES ARE MOVING IN PERFECT CONCERT WITH THESE WITH THESE SMALL OBJECT MOVEMENTS AND THEREFORE THEY ARE THEYR I AM BLIND TO THEM  A SLIGHT SHIFT IN TIME PERCEPTION AM THINK OF THIS A PERHAPS AS SOM A CHANGEING THE FRAME RATE MI CAMERA FRAME RATES AT FASTER FRAME RTE YOU CAN CAPTURE SLOW MOTION SLOWER FRAME RATE YOU GAN TO GET MORE OF A STROBE TYPE EFFECT IF THE FRAME RATE IS LOW ENOUGH R RIGHT COULD IT BE THAT OUR TIME PERCEPTION IS NOT ONE THING BUT WE HAVE ONE RATE OF PERCEIVING TIME FOR EXTERNAL OBJECTS HAT A GIVEN DISTANCE WHICH WE KNOW IS TRUE ANOTHER FRAME RATE FOR OBJECTS THAT ARE UP CLOSE WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE EVEN IF THOSE OBJECTS ARE MOVING AT THESE ACT SAME SPEED RITIM IN THIS WOULD BE THUS SITTING ON A TRAIN THE RUNGS ON THE FENCE SEEM TO BE GOING BY VERY VERY FAST BUT THE ONES IN THE DISTANCE SEEM TO BE MOVING SLOWLY REST IS THE WAY THOUGT THE VISUAL SYSTEM AN TIME PERCEPTION INTERCONNECT AT SOME LEVEL UM YOU'R PON A SKY SCRAPER THE LITTLE ANTS OF CARS AN PEOPLE UM DOWN BELOW YOU KNOW THEY'RE MOVING MUCH FASTER THAN YOU PERCEIVE THEM TO MOVE YEBUT IT'S TH IT'S A DISTANCE OF AN YOU SEE IT YOU SEE A PLAIN AS COULD BE GOING THREE HUNDERED MILES ANOW ARE EXACT AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF RESOLUTION THE LACK OF RESOLUTION IS INCIDENTAL WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE IN ANIMALS SUCH AS UM HAWKS THAT HAVE TWICE THE DEGREE OF VACUITY AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEY HAVE THE SAME A DISTANCE ASSOCIATED SHIFTS IN TIME PERCEPTION SO COULD IT BE THAT WE ARE RUNNING MULTIPLE STREAMS OF TIME PERCEPTI MULTIBLE CONES OF ATTENTION THAT INCLUDE CONES OF ATTENTION TO OUR THOUGHTS AND THAT SOMEHOW THROUGH MEDITATION WE START TO A LINE THE FRAME RATE FOR THESE DIFFERENT STREAMS OF ATTENTION SO THAT THEY ALL FALL INTO SA THEY ALL FALL INTO THE SAME MOVY IF YOU WILL ALTHOUGH IT'S NOXIOUS U MOVYOU WITH VISUAL CONTENT WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS A CLEARLY I'M BECOMING A LUMPER RATHER THAN OF SMIRDER II'M SURE THIS VIOLATES CERTAIN RULES OF TIME PERCEPTION NERL CIRCUITRY BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S ENTIRELY UNTRUE EITHER UM AND DOES IT SURVIVE A AAT ALL AS A POSSIBLE MODEL FOR WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AND IF THE ANSWERIS KNOW I'M PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE N THAT WELL IT SAY I'M IT'S DEPENDENT ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY MEDITATION THAT THIS IS WHAT Y SORT THE PARTICULARITIES OF OF WHAT ONE IS DOING WITH ONE'S ATTENTION UNDER THE YOU KNOW THE FRAME OF MEDITATION REALLY MATTER BECS IT THEIR WAYS TO PRACTICE WERE IS PRACTISE MINDFULNESS IN PARTICULAR WERE THE FRAME RATE REALLY DOES SEEM TO GO WAYWAY UP RAGHIN THAT IT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SOME RESEARCS DONE ON THIS WE TAKE PEOPLE IN BEFORE AND AFTER A THREE MONTH SILENT MEDITATION RETREAT AND YOU GIVE THEM SOME KIND OF VISUAL DIS DISCRIMINATION T ASK WHERE THEY HAVE TO LIKE TDETECT TAM I THINK THEY USE I TO O TO TO TO  TO KISTOSCOPE IS THAT THE TO FOR THERTHE SOMESOME OME THEY PRESENT A AM YOU KNOW LIKE VERY QUICK PULSES OF LIGHT AND IN ANY CASE YOU CAN YOU CAN DISCRIMINATE IAM JUST IN ANY IN ANY CENSORY CHANNEL I WOULD IMAGINE YOU CAN MAKE FINER GRAIN DISCRIMINATIONS IF YOURE PRACTICING MINDFULNESS IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY WHICH IS TO BE MAKING THESE FINE GRIN DISCRIMINATIONS MORE AND MORE AND DO DO NOTHING ELSE FOR YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS WHICH IS WHICH IS A WAY OF PRACTICING SA YOUR SO THE CLASSIC N A MINDFULNESS PRACTICE IN IN WAS CALLED THE VEPOSSON A MEDITATION IS TO PAY SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION TO SEEING HERING SMELLING TASTING TOUCHING IN A WAY THAT BREAKS EVERYTHING DOWN INTO THIS KIND O MICROSCOPIC SENSORY A MOMENTS SO IN A YOURE RATHER THAN FEEL YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR HANDS PRESSING TOGETHER WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FEEL WITH YOUR ATTENTION AND YOUR FEELING MORE AND MORE IS ALL OF THE MIKEROW SENSATIONS OF PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE AND MOVEMENT A SUCH THAT THE FEELING OF HANDS COMPLETELY DISAPPEARS YOU REALIZE THAT THE HAND AS A CONCEPT AND ALL YOU HAVE IS THIS CLOUD OF OF PUNCTATE AND AND A VERY BRIEF SENSATIONS AND SO THAT ITSO ANYTHING YOU THINK YOU YOU YOU HAVE AS A DATEM OF EXPERIENCE AS YOU AS YOU BORE INTO IT WITH YOUR ATTENTION IT IT RESOLVES INTO A A THIS KIND OF DIOT THAT DIAPINES CLOUD OF CHANGING SENSATION AND THAT CAN BE EVEN EVEN SOMETHING IS AS A CAPTIVATING AS LIKE THAT YOU KNOWA SERIOUS PAIN IN YOUR BODY M YOU HAVE LIKE A YUUYOU COULDHAVE INJURED YOUR NECK YOU KNOW AND YOU HAVE SOME EXCRUCIATING PAIN IN YOUR NECK IF YOU JUST ARE WILLING TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT YOU KNOW AND JUST PAY A HUNDRED PRERCENT ATTENTION TO IT A YOUARE A COUPLE THINGS HAPPEN ONE IS YOUR RESISTANCE TO FEELING IT GOES AWAY BY DEFINITION CAUSE YOURE NOW YOUR GOL AS IS JUST PAY ATTENTION TO IT AND AND YOU RECOGNIZE THAT SO MUCH OF THE SUFFERING ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAIN WAS BORN OF A OF THE RESISTANCE TO FEELING IT YOURE CON YOUBRACING AGAINST IT AND ALL OF YOUR THINKING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW YOU THNK LIKE WILL WILL ON WHY DI I DO THIS TO MYSELF OR WHEN YOU SHOULD I SEE A NORTH OF PETISTOR WHY HOW LONG IS IT ONE A LAST AND AND YOUARE  MAYBE I HERNEATED A DISK LIKE ALL OF THAT SELF TALK IS PRODUCING ANXIETY AND YOU KNOW UNLEST SAYING THERS NEVER ANYTHING TO THINK ABOUT THERE BUT YOU KNOW EITHER YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IN THE MOMENT OR YOU CAN'T AND SO MUCH OF OUR SUFFERING IN IN THE PRESENCE OF PAIN IS THE RESULT OF RESISTING IT WORRYING ABOUT IT THINK IS JUST ALL OF THE EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING WITH OUR MINDS BUT JUST IF JUST FEELING RIGHT SO WHEN YOU  JUST FEEL IT AGAIN ITIT IT BREAKS APART INTO THIS THIS EVER CHAIN EVER SHIFTING COLLECTION OF OF DIFFERENT SENSATIONS AND IT'S NOT ONE THING AND IT NEVER STAYS THE SAME AND IT'S AND SO THAT TWO THINGS HAPPEN THER ONE IS THERE CAN BE TREMENDOUS  TREMENDOUS TAT OF RELIEF THAT HAPPENS THERE WAR YU YOU OU YU CAN ACHIEVE A LEVEL OF EQUANIMITY EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF REALLY UNPLEASANT IVING A PHYSICAL SENSATION A AND THIS IS TRUE OF MENTAL SENSATION AS WELL AS WIS TRUE OF EMOTIONS YOU KNOW THE CLASSICALLY NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE ANGER OR DEPRESSION OR   FEAR THE MOMENT YOU BECOME WILLING TO JUST FEEL THEM IN ALL OF THEIR IN A PUNCTATE A A ENCHANGEABLE QUALITIES THEY CEASE TO BE WHAT THEY THEY WERE A MOMENT AGO THEY'RE JUST THEIR AND THEY N WHN YOU'E TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONAL STATES THEY CEASE TO MAP BACK ON TO YOU AND YOUR SELF CONCEPT AS MEANINGFUL IN THE SAME WAY SO THAT SUDDENLY YOU KNOW THE ANXIETY YOU FEEL LIESL SAY BEFORE GOING OUT ON STAGE TO GIVE A TALK YOU KNOW A MOMENT AGO IF IT WAS IT HAD PSYCHOLOGICAL MEANING I FELT LIKE YOU KNOW LOOK IT I'M ANXIOUS HOW TO I GET RID OF THIS YOU KNOW WHY IAM I THES SORT OF PERSON WHAT YOU NOR SHOULD I HAVE TAKEN A BATEABLOCKER YOU KNOW THIS IS T E CONVERSATIONYORE YOU'RE HAVING WITH YOURSELF THE MOMENT YOU JUST BECOME WILLING TO FEEL IT AS THE PURE ENERGY OF OUTHE PHYSIOLOGY OF OF YOU KNOW OF COURSE IS ALL RELEASE IT CEASES TO HAVE ANY MEANING IT JUST CEASES TO BE A PROBLEM IN THAT MOMENT BECAUSE IT IS NO MORE IT NO MORE MAPS ON TO THE KIND OF PERSON YOU ARE THAN A FEELING OF INDIGESTION OR A PAIN IN YOUR IN YOUR KNEE MAPS ON TO THE KIND OF PERSON YOU ARES JUST IT IT ITS JUST SENSATION ANYWAT BACK TO THE MAIN POINT HERE WHICH IS THAT IF YOU TRAIN YOUR ATTENTION IN THIS WAY TO NOTICE THE PARTICULARITIES OF OF SENSORY EXPERIENCE AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE ATOMS OF EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW IM YOU GET BETTER AND BETTER AT THAT AND CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN BUT ONE THING THATYOU ONE THING THAT IREALLY DO DO THINK HAPPENS IS THERE'S A KIND OF FRAME RATE CHANGE IN IN THE THE DATA STREAM WHERE YOU REALLY ARE JUST YOUR S NOTICING MUCH MUCH MORE IM ALL OF THAT IS N I VERY INTERESTING WAY OF TRAINING IT'S NOT WHAT I TEND TO RECOMMEND NOW IBS IS IT'S AE GREAT PRELIMINARY PRACTICE FOR WHAT I DO RECOMMEND BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU IT RE REALLY TEACHES YOU THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING LOST ON THOUGHT AND NOT IT REALLY TEACHES YOU WHAT MINDFULNESS IS BUT IT TENDS TO BE DONE YOU KNOW BY YOUNINETY NINE POINT NINE PER CENT OF OF PEOPLE IN A DUALISTIC WAY WHICH YOU AGAIN YOU YOUR YOUR SET UP TO THINK OOKING I'M OVER HERE IS THE LOCUST OF ATTENTION YOU KNOW AND AND I AM CONTINUALLY GETTING DISTRACTED BY THOUGHT AND THE PROJECT IS TO NOT DO THAT ANY MORE AND ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE BREATH AND SOUNDS AND SENSATIONS AND AND EVERY TIME I GET LOST IN THOUGHT I MA TO GO BACK HERE BUT THIS WHOLE DANCE OF I'VE LOST IN THOUGHT NOW I'M NOW I'M STRATIGICALLY DIRECTING MY ATTENTION AGAIN ALL OF THIS SEEMS TO RAMIFY THIS SENSE OF SELF THE SENSE OF OF THERE THERE'S ONE TO BE DOING THIS THERE'S ERE'S SOMEBODY HOLDING THE SPOTLIGHT OF ATTENTION AND GETTING BETTER AT COMING BACK TO THE OBJECT OF MEDITATION IM AGAIN IT'S INEVITABLE THAT NINETY NINE POINT NINE PER CENTOF PEOPLE ARE GIN A START THERE AND STAY THERE FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME BUT THE THING I LIKE TO DO WHEN I TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS UNDER CUT THE FALSE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE ANCHORING ALL OF THAT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WERE IT WERE YOUWHERE I THINK YOU WANT TO BE IS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS NO PLACE FROM WHICH TO AIM ATTENTION THERE THIS WHOLE DUALISTIC SET UP OF SUBJECT AND OBJECT IS THE THING THAT IS ALREADY NOT THERE AND IT'S NOT THAT YOU ITS NOT THAT IT'S THERE AND YOU MEDITATED OUT OF EXISTENCE SUCCESSFULLY IT'S REALLY NOT THERE AND IF YOU IF YOU LEARN HOW TO LOOK FOR IT YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S NOT THERE AND FEEL THAT IT'S NOT THERE AND IT NO LONGER SEEMS TO BE THERE RIGHT AS LIKE ITS IT'S NOT AND IT BECOMES LIKE AGAIN LIKE A BY STABLE PERCEPT WERE IT YOU LOOKED AT IT LONG ENOUGH AN YOU THOUGH LOOKING NOW I SEE THE VAYS AND THE FACE AND I'M I CAN'T UNSEE IT AND EVERY TIME I LOOK IT'S IT'S THERE AGAIN RIGHT AND I'M SO YET THAT IS AT SO TO COME BACK TO THE THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE WITH YOUR AM YOUR COLLEGUE AT STANFORD I'M WHOSE BOOK I KNOW I HAVE I HAVEN'T READ IT AS THIS IS THE HE WROTE A BOOK PROJECTIONS RIGHT IYESS AROT YA I'M I SO IT'S IT'S ALL MY STACK TO READ BUT I'M IT'S THE OPPOSITE WHAT I'M RECOMMENDING ESSENTIALLY THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CONTINUUM OF THE SORT OF INTERNAL EXERCISE HE WAS HE HE WAS DOING SO RATHER THAN SO YOU HE'S DOING SOMETHING VERY DELIBERAT AND CONTROLLED AND HE'S YOU KNOW HE IS DELIBERATELY THINKING IN COMPLETE SENTENSES AND KIND OF COMMON DEERING THE YOU KNOW THE THE IVE THE MACHINERY OF THOUGHT AND ATTENTION I IN A WAY THAT I WOULD IMAGINE AN NOT BE INTREST TO TALKED HIM ABOUT IT BUT I WOULD IMAGIN IT HE REALLY FEELS LIKE HE IS DOING THAT RIGHT AND THERE'S E YON A ENGINEER EXA YOU KNOW ITSITE AS YOU DESCRIBE IT IN THIS WAY IT IT REMIND ME HE HE'S HE'S A PHYSICIAN BUT  HE'S ALSO AN ENGINEER SUCH UR ABOUT TAKING THE THE WRAW MATERIALS OF THOUGHT AND ENGINEERING SOMETHING STRUCTURED FROM IT RIGHT IM R YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN IN A QUARL'S MIND IM YOU HAVE T  GOT A TALKING ON THAT YOU UD IMSURE WD GET YES WHAT IT IS YO'LL DO THAT CONVERSATION AT SOME POINT THE EUT YO  EXACT OPPOSITE IF W EXACT OPPOSITE WOULD BE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE SENSE OF CONTROL IS A TOTAL ILLUSION RI THERE E COULD BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO THINK NEXT RIGHT AND EVEN HE IN THE MOST LABORIOUS WAY AT ME HE COULD HE COULD JUST GET IS MUSCULAR AS HE WANTS WITH IT HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO THINK NEXT RI THOUGHT BECAUSE THOUGHT SIMPLY ARISE RIGHT LIKE IT YOU NOW TO BE YOU KNOW YOU CAN RUN THIS EXPERIMENT FOR YOURSELF AN THIS CONNECTS UP TO THE TOPIC OF A FREE WILL WHICH A WE MIGHT WANT A TOUCH BUT I MAY JUST THINK OF ANY CATEGORY OF THING YOU NOF I ASKED YOU TO THINK OF YOU KNOW THE NAMES OF CITIES OR O YOU KNOW FRIENDS YOU HAVE OR FAMOUS PEOPLE YOU YOU CAN YOU REMEMBER EXIST OR I THINK OF NOUNDS OR YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ANYTHING I'M AND JUST WATCH WHAT COMES PERCOLATING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS RIGHT NOW THERE'S THERE THINGS YOU CAN'T THINK OF EATHER THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF YOU KNOW THEIR LANGUAGES YOU DON'T SPEAK THERE'S THEIR FAMOUS PEOPLE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN OR NEVER HEARD OF RIGHTS LIKET LIKE SO YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THAT PART LIKE THOSE THOSE NAMES AND AND FACES ARE NOT GOING TO SUDDENLY COMES TRAIMG ING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS BUT OF OF THE THE THE TOTALITY OF FACTS AND FIGURES AND FACES AND NAMES THAT YOU DO KNOW RIGHT ONLY SOME WILL COME VYING FOR INCLUSION RIGHT AND THEY'RE NOT AND THERE'S THERE'S A SORT OF YOU NO UMT  WE COULD I MAY GUESS THAT WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE NAUROLOGY OF THIS BUT WE NO DEPENDING ON WHAT CHAN ALL YOU ARE YOU ARE I YOU'RE WAITING FOR THOUGHTS IN I MES CAN BE DIFFEREN IF ITS VISUAL OR SOMEANTIC OR ER IM EPISODE I MEMORY N AT ALL THESE THNGS ARE DIFFERENT BUT I WHEREVER YOU CON A POINT YOUR INNER GAZE OF ATTENTION AND WAIT FOR THE NEXT FACE OR NAME I CERTAIN THINGS ARE GOING TO COME AND CERTAIN  CERTAIN THINGS AREN'T GOING TO COME AND HOW YOU LAND ON ONE RIT THEY'LL BE THIS PROCESS IF YOUR PAYIN ATTENTION TO YYOU MIGHT THINK E'LL SHAY WE'LL SAY WE GO WITH NAMES OF CITIES RIGHT YOU JUST YOU SAY YOU'LL YOU'LL THIK OF PARIS YOU'LL THINK OF LONDON YOU'LL THINK OF ROME YOU'LL THINK OF OF SODONA YOULL THINKTLY SO THAT THESE THESE NAMES ILL COME AND IF I ASK YOU TO JUST SAY ONE RIGHT SUCH AS MANIAPLIS IS WHAT CAME TO MINE FOR ME AS VERY RSTRAIT FOR IT IS MANIAPLIS THE FAMOUS PERSON WAS JOESTRUMMER AND THAY JUS LIKE I CAN WRIT YOU REASONS WHY I THINK THEY THOSE CAME TO MINE WESURN CONVERSATIONS O SO  SO SO WHATEVER SO WE KNOW WE KNOW A FAIR ABOUT A MA  VAIR BIT ABOUT MUCH OF THIS SO ONE WE KNOW THAT YOUR REASONS YOU KNOW OFISIT COULD BE RIGHT OR WRONG HTHEYRE VERY LIKELY TO BE WRONG BECAUSE WE HAVE THI SORT OF CONFABULATORY STORY TELLING MECHANISM EVEN IN AN INTACT BRAIN WHERE WE JUST YOU KNOW WE WWE ALWAS SEEM TO NEVER LACK FOR THE REASONS WHY SOMETHING CAME TO MIND AND WE KNOW WE CAN KNOW WE CAN MANIPULATE PEOPLE IN WAYS THAT PROVE THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST RELIABLY WRONG AND CONFIDENT YOU KNOW CONIDENTLY SO ABOUT THE REASONS WHY THEY THOUGHT OF THINGS ARE DID THINGS BUT WEAVIN OUT ASIDE EVEN IF YOU'RE COMPLETELY ACCURATE RIGHT I THERE ARE THERE ARE PEOPLE'S NAMES WHO YOU KNOW ENCITYES NAMES THAT YOU KNOW THAT INEXPLICABLY JUST DIDN'T COME TO MIND AND IF WE RAN THIS EXPERIMENT AGAIN AND AGAIND AGAIN T THEY WOULDN'T COME TO MIN IF YOUR BRAIN WAS IN PRECISELY THE STATE IT WAS IN A MOMENT AGO IF WE WIF WE COULD RETURN YOUR BRAIN TO THE STATE IT WAS IN A MOMENT AGO CORRECTING FOR YOU KNOW ALL THE DETERMINIST IC CHANGES AND ALL THE RANDOM CHANGES THAT WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW BE CORRECTED FOR ITIT JUST GET ALL THE SYNAPSES AND THE SYNAPTIC WAITS AND EVERYTHING IN IN THE THE STATE IT WAS IN TO PRODUCE JOE' STRUMMER AND MANIAPOLISTS RIGHT YOU ARE GOING TO WE REMIND THAT MOVY THAT THAT PART OF THE MOVY OF YOUR LIFE YOU ARE GOING TO SAY JOE'S STRUMMER AND MANIAPOLISTS A TRILLIAN TIMES IN A ROW RIGHT THIS IS WHY YOUN MY VIEW THE NOTION OF FREE WILL MAKES ABSOLY NO SENSE  I AND YOU CAN AT AS MUCH RANDOM TOSS THAT PROCESS AS YOU WAND IT STILL DOESN'T GET YOU THE FREEDOM PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE I THERE'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT YOU WHY ONE OF THAT MATTERS AND WHY THINGS ONLY GET BETTER ONCE YOU ADMIT TO YOURSELF THAT FREE WILL'S AN ILLUSION A AND YES YOU CAN GET IN SHAPE AND YOU CAN DIEET ANDYOU CAN DO ALL THINGS YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT FREE WILL I B UT THE FROM IT FROM A CONTEMPLATIVE MEDITATIVE POINT OF VIEW THE THING TO NOTICE IS THAT EVERYTHING IS JUST SPRINGING IN TO VIEW RIGHT YOU'RE LIKE THIS NO PLACE FROM WHICH YOU ARE OFTHERING YOUARE NEXT THOUGHT BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO THINK IT BEFORE YOU THINK IT RIGHT LIKE LIKE IT LIKE THERE IS JUST THERE IS JUST THIS FUNDAMENTAL MYSTERY AT OUR BACKS THAT IS DISGORGING EVERYTHING THAT WE EXPERIENCE AND WHAT IF I'M SPEAKING SO IF I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING AND I HAVE SOME COMMAND OF THAT I INFORMATION I CAN OFTEN SENSE WHAT I'M MINTO SAY NEXT AN  ON MYSELF SAYING IT HOFULLY THAT'S YE SAND ON SOMETHING ELSE I CERTAINLY SAID THINGS I DIDN'T INTEND TO SAY OR NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY IN LIFE BUT IM WHEN ENGAGED IN SPEECH OR ACTION IT IT LEAST GIVES US THE ILLUSION I THINK THAT WE  SOMEHOW HAVE MORE COMMAND OVER OUR THOUGHTS YOU WELL OU HAVE A SCRIPT AND ME S LIKE THAT THEIR THINGS YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT AND YOU'VE TALKED OF YOYOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THEM A LOT AND YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE THINGS YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT THOSE THINGS IND THE THINGS YOU YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY OR YOU YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SAY I'M AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN OIT STILL IS A BIT OF A HIGH WIRE ACT BECASE YOU CAN MISPEAK OR YOU CAN FAIL TO GET TO THE END OF A SENTENCE RIIN A DRAMMATICALLY CORRECT WAY AND AND IT'S AGAIN ALL THE SUBJECTIVELY THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS MYSTERIOUS TO YOU RIGT LIKE YOU YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'VE FOLLOW THE RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR RIGHT LIKELYT LIKE LY I JUST YOU S A IT YOUR TONGUE IS DOING IT SOMEHOW AND YOU KNOW IM AND WHEN IT FAILS IT FAILS AND YOU'RE JUST AS SURPRISE AS THE NEXT GY THAT IT FAILED AND YOU KNOW YOU MISPRONOUNCE A WORD AND OK I I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE BUT IT'S IF IT KEEPS HAPPENING I'M THE A WHERERY I HAD A STROKE AND YOU KNOW IT STOPS I'M I'M YOU KNOW I'M NOT CN A WORY ABOUT IT I SO IT'S STILL MYSTERIOUS EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT IN A VERY I WROT DELIBERATIVE AND REREPETITIVE WAY BUT WHEN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT AND YOU KNOW YOU SORT OF KNOW WHERE YOU GING TO GO RIGHT LIKE N THIS OUO WE HAVE MANY CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS I'M IT IS SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO LIKE A GOLF'S WING WER'S LIKE YOU KNOW HOW YOU WANT TO DO IT IS CON BE ALL KIND OF ERRORS THAT AN TO CREEP INTO YOUR EXECUTION OF IT IIN REAL TIME BUT THERE'S LIKE YOU BE BASICALLY HAVE A PATTERN AND SO YUYOU HAVE CERTAIN LINGUISTIC PATTERNS WHICH YOU'RE FOLLOWING I'M AGAIN NONE OF THIS IS THE PROOF OF A FREE WILL BUT I WILL GRANT YOU THAT IN A PHENOMENA LOGICALLY IT IT FEELS DIFFERENT THEN JUST WAITING FOR THE NEXT THOUGHT TO COME BUT MY POINT IS I IS THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE I'M ND YOU CAN TRIM ANOW TO THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE THING ND LIKE YOU TAKE TWO THINGS YOU LIKE T TO DRINK RIGHT YOU MAY YOU LIKE YOU LIKE COFFEE AND YOU LIKE T AND YOU'RE DECIDING WHICH TO HAVE I BOTH OR ON FFER YOU GET TWO CUPS IN FRONT OF YOU AND AND THE QUESTION AS YOU KNOW WHICH YOU KNOWOR II HERE I'VE GOT WATERAND I'VE GOT COFFEE WHICH OM MI GOING TO DRANK NEXT IT'S IT'S INCREDIBLY IT'S TE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE DECISION AND NO MATTER HOW LONG I MAKE THIS DECISION PROCESS I COULD LITEALLY SIT FOR AN HOUR TRYING TO FIGURE OT WHICH TO REACH FOR NEXT AND I COULD HAVE MY REASONS WHY AND I COULD HAVE MY ALL MYSELF TALK THERE'S IE'S THERE'S GOING TO BE A FINAL CHANGE IN ME THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF ME DECIDING ONE OVER THE OTHER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW LABORIOUS I CAN MAKE IT SEEM IN IN TERMS OF MY REASONING ABOUT IT I'M IT IS GOIN TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY MYSTERIOUS AS TO WHY I WENT WITH ONE RATHER THAN THE OTHER RE WHATEVER STORY I HAVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT IT'S IT'S STILL BEN TO BE AS MYSTERIOUS AS YOU THINKING OF JOE'S DRUMMER WHAND YOU ABSOLUTE LIKE YOU KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF MARILYMEN RO JUST AS MUCH AND YET SHE SIMPLY DIDN'T OCCUR TO YOU RIGHT'S LIKE IT'S IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY MYSTERIOUS LIKE THERE PEOPLE WHO ARE EVEN MORE FAMOUS THAN JOE'S DRUMMER TO YOU RIGHT WHO WHOMI AM SURE YOU UMAY BE SOMEBODY WHYOU HAVE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT BUT BUT THE'RE THER'RE PEOPLE WHO LIKE IF WE COULD JUST INVENTORY YOU KNOW YOUR CONSCIOUS LIFE GOING BACK LAST TEN YEARS THER'RE PEOPLE WHO YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT MORE THAN JOE'SDRUMMER YET THEY DIDN'T APPEAR RIGHT SO D THAT'S THAT IS MYSTERIOUS RIGHT AND THEY COULD AVE BUT THEY DIDN'T AND SO I'M AND WHAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THIS MYSTERY NEVER GETS BANISHED IN OUR EXPERIENCE WHATEVER STORIES WE HAVE TO TELL ABOUT IT BIKE BECAUSE IF THE STORY IS OH WELL I WENT FOR THE WATER BECAUSE SOME I YOUKNOWI I I THINK I'VE BEEN DRINKING TO MUCH COFFEE AN III LISTEN TO ANDREW HUBERMAN'S PODCAST AND HE WAS SAYING TALKING ABOUT CAFFENE I THINK A PRICE GOOD FOR US BEY I DOON OVER YEI' COUS UST SAY THAT IS ACTUALLY THE CAUSAL CHAIN LIKE I LISTENED YOUR PODCASTYU TO SOMETHING ABOUT CAFFEN NOW I'M NOW I'M SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT MY COFFEE AND TAKE RIGHT BUT THAT'S JUST JUST ADDING WHAT COUPLE OF LINKS TO THE CHAIN THERE'S THE STILL THEST FUNDAMENTAL MYSTERY OF WELL WHY DID I FIND THAT PERSUASIVE AND WHY WHY DID I FIND A PERSUASIVE NOW AND NOT FIVE MINUTES AGO WHEN I WAS DRINKING THE COFFEE RIGHT LIKE WHY DID I JUST REMEMBER IT NOW OR WHY WAS IT DEFFECTIVE NAT LIKE WHAT LIKE YOU YOU ONLY HAVE YOU'RE EXPERIENCE IN EVERY MOMENT IT'S PRECISELY WHAT IT IS AND NOT ONE BIT MORE LIKE AND THIS SUBSUMES EVEN MOMENTS OF REAL RESOLVE AND EFFORTS AND YOU KNOW PICKING YOURSELF UP BY YOUR BOOTSTRAPS AND CHANGING EVERYTHINGS LIKE YOU'RE ON A DIET AND YOU'RE TEMPTED E CHOCOLATE AND YOU THINK YOU'RE BOUT TO REACH ME THIY NOW I'M NOT I'M NOT BREAK IN THIS DET THIS DIET IS ACTUALLY IN A STICK RIGHT ET WHY DID THAT ARISE IN THAT MOMENT AND NOT AT THIS ANALICOUS MOMENT ON YOUR LAST IET RIGHT AND WHY DID IT ARISE NOW TO PRECISELY TO THE DEGREE THAT IT DID WHY WHY WILL IT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS IT WILL BE AND HAVE THE HALF LIFE THAT IT WILL HAVE AND NOT YOU KNOW TEN PER CENT MORE OR LESS LIKE ALL THOSE ARE ALWAYS MYSTERIOUS DEAR COULD WE GIVE A AS WE DO BEFORE AM AN EVOLUTIONARY AN A DEVELOPMENT AL EXPLANATION AND EVOLUTIONARY EXPLANATION MIGHT BE THAT AM DIRECTED ATTENTION AN ACTION IS METABOLICALLY DEMANDING IT WOULD BE A INEFFICIEN TOR IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO BE IN CONSTANT YOU KNOW DELIBERATE ACTION AWITH ACCESS TO ALL THE RELEVANT INFORMATION AS TO WHY WE WOULD DO ANYTHING SO OUR IDEAS LITERALLY SPRING TO THE CURFACE A AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT A IN ORDER TO OFFSET A HE METABOLIC THE GREAT METABOLIC REQUIREMENTS OF HAVING IDEAS THAT  R RELATE TIGAL DIRECTED ACTION OR THAT GO DIRECTED ACTION IS EXPENSIVE THAT'S ONE IDEA THE OTHER IDEA WOULD BE AND WE KNOW THIS AS A FACT WHICH IS THAT INITIALLY THE BRAIN IS FAIRLY CRUDELY WIRED THAT'S NOT TRUE WITHIN THE NARRAL CIRCUITS THE CONTROL BREATHING A HEART RATE ET CETERA BUT WITHIN THE NARROL CIRCUITS OF A SENSORY PERCEPTION THOUGHT AT CETERA THER FAIRLY CRUDELY WIRED AND THEN ACROSS DEVELOPMENT THERE'S A PROGRESSIVE PRUNING BACTIAND AM A ALSO IN PARALLEL TO THAT A STRENGTHENING OF THE CONNECTIONS THAT UNDER LIE DIRECTED ACTION AND THOUGHT A AND HERE I DON'T MEAN DIRECTED AS IN FREE WILL I MEAN JUST  THAT THAT CAN I CAN DECIDE TO IMAGINE AN APPLE AND IMAGINE THAT APPLE FOR INSTANCE AM BUT YOUR DDERES SEERS TO BE SOME MAINTENANCE OF THE THE RANDOM FINE RANDOM WIRING IN SYSTEMS I MEAN WE SEEM THISS EVEN IN IN WORMS IN FLIES IN IN YOU KNOWIN A SO CALLED LOWER O INVERTEBRAS AND LOWER VERTEBRATES AND WE SEE THIS IN HUMANS AND IT SEEMS TO BE A THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BACKGROUND SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY UM ENOUGH SOME COLLECTRODES INTO THE BRAINS OF A HUMAN'S MACAX CARNIVORS AND MICES AND IN EVERY CASE MOST OF WHAT YOU HEAR IS CALLED HASHION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HASHIHIS JU A MRAUDIO MINERES ERE PICKIN UP A BUNCH ACTION POTENTIALS RAS ER LISTENING TO A CHORUS OF ACTION POTENTIALS BUT IT'S RARE DEFIN INER ON THAT FAITHFULLY COMFIRES TO REPRESENT SOME SENSORY STIMULUS IN THE WORLD AND YOU CAN ARRANGE THAT MARRIAGE EXPERIMENTALLY SO THAT YOU CAN ARRIVE AT THE STRONG SIGNAL O NOISE EVENTS BUT I WAS ALWAYS STRUCK BY HOW MUCH NOISE THERE IS IN THE SYSTEM ALL AROUND ALL THE TIME ENPABLE ARGUE IS THE NOISE REALLY NOISE ET CETERA AND ISYOU KNOW A THERE'S STILL LOT O BADE ABOUT THAT BUT I CAN IMAGINE THAT SOME OF THE O THE SPONTANEOUS NATURE OF THOUGHTS JUST RELATES TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BACKGROUND SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN NOW WHY THAT IS IS THE WHOLE OTHER DISCUSSION BUT A BUT IF I WERE TO SOR SET UP TO CONSTRAINTS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY IT'S GONAGENERATE RANDOM THOUGHTS THANKFULLY NOT MUCH RANDOM ACTION ALTHOUGH THERE'S LOTWL BIT OF RANDOM ACTION IN OUR DAILY LIVES AND THEN AGAINST THAT SAY WILL ANY DELIBERATE THOUGHT OR MOTION IS GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE IT IS A METABOIC LE EXPENSIVE ORGAN TO BEGIN WITH AND SO YOU DESCEFTED EVOLUTION HAS ARRIVED AT A PLACE WHERE AM SPONTANEOUS GUISERING UP OF THINGS UM UPON WHICH LIKE DELIBERATE THOUGHTS AND ACTION ARE SUPERIMPOSED IS THE BEST ARRANGEMENT OVER ALL FOR THIS VERY METABOLICALLY DEMANDIORGAN IS THAT IS THAT O IMEAN WHAT I BASELY GAVE WAS THIST KIND OF A BIOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF OF OF ONE JUST ONE NARROW ASPECT OF IT BUT CAN WE GET COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND THE REASON I AY GET COMFORTABLE IS THAT OU KNI'M ND HERE I INMITLY I'M FORCING A LITTLE BIT OF A STRIP TEAS TOWARDS WHAT I THINK I AND EVERYONE ELSE WANTS TO KNOW WHICH IS HOW TO MEDITATE AND WHY IN PARTICULAR MEDITATION CONVINCES US THAT SOMETHING DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED BUT THAT WAS ACTUALLY NEVER THERE I'VE EU LIKE WERE WE'RE NOW SET UP OF A SORT OF ALMOST LIKE A I YOU'RE NOT CONTRADICTING YOURSELF BY ANY MEANS BUT IN MY MIND THERE'S A CONTRADICTION AND HERE'S THE CONTRADICTION I LOVE THIS STATEMENT THAT MEDITATION OVER TIME OR DONE PROPERLY REVEALS TO US THAT RACTUALLY NOT TRYING TO MAKE THE GAP BETWEEN ACTER AN OBSERVER GO AWAY IT WAS ACTUALLY NEVER THERE TO ME THAT'S ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT STATEMENTS THAT I PERHAPS HAVE EVER HEARD AND IT INSPIRES ME TO GO FURTHER DOWN THIS PATH OF MEDITATION BECAUSE I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCE THAT I'M NOT DELIBERATELY AND CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH MEDITATION UM IF I EVER EXPERIENCED IT IT WAS TRANSIENT ENOUGH THAT I YOU KNOW I'M ENTRIGUE TO TO   CRRENCY MORE SO ON THE ONE HAND YOU'RE TELLING ME SOMETHING WAS NEVER THERE AND THERE'S A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE TO BE HAD BY ANY ONE THAT'S WILLING TO DO THE WORK TO ARRIVE AT THAT EXPERIENCE OF THE LOSS OF THAT ILLUSION ON THE OTHER HAND I'M HEARING THAT THERE'S A AM A PROFOUND GAP THAT REALLY DOES EXIST WHICH IS THAT YO WE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR THOUGHTS ARE AM SOMEHOW FROM US IM AND INDEED THEREFROM IN IN THE CRANIAVAULT SOME PLACE MAY BEIN THE BODY AF IT AS WELL BUT THAT WE OVER A A TRIBUTE THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE ARE THAT AND THAT IS US IN A WAY THAT'S VOLITIONAL THAT WE CONTROL AND SO AT ONCE I'M HEARING THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE'S AN ILLUSION THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE N ON THE OTHER HAND I'M HEARING THAT THERE'S AN ILLUSION THAT WE CAN'T ELIMINATE AND MAYBE THESE ARE UNRELATED IND UMBRIDGING THEM IN IT IN IT IN AN UNIMPORTANT WAY THAT SEEMS ONLY IMPORTANT TO ME BUT SOMEHOW I I CAN'T RESOLVE THESE TWO AND MAYBE THE THING TO DO THEN IS IS CAN WE SEPARATE THEM IN TERMS OF A PRACTICE TO WITNESS THEM THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO RESOLVE THEM SEPARATELY RIGHTY I THINK I I'M HEARING THE PROMLY ITHERE'S THIS IM  BUT LET ME LEKE AN A BRACK AT THE WHOLE FREE WILL DISCUSSION CONSITS IT'S IF IT REALLY IS THE CLIPS IDE OF THIS CIN THATHAT I'M THE OBVERSE OF WHICH IS THE ILLUSIOTHE ILUSION OF THE CELL  SO AT LEAST I I MIGHT B N NET RI IS O GEN THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF A AVYE OCIARI BECAUSE TO ME THEY SEEM VERY DIFFERENT  YEIN ESSENCE KNO CSBEAUSE WHAT I'M CALLING THE SENSE OF SELF AND WHAT PEOPLE WHAT I THINK MOST PEO WLL FEEL AS THEIR COUR SENSE OF SELF IS THE THIS FEELING OF I ME IS IT'S THE FEELING OF BEING THE LOCUST OF ATTENTION BUT IT'S ALSO TE FEELING OF BEING THE LOCUST OF AGENCY LIKE I CAN DO THE NEXT THING I I  LIKE WHO'SE DOING THIS WHO'SE REACHING FOR THE CUP I AM RIGHT I I INTENDED THIS AND NOW I'M DOING THE THING TOU MAY END MY INTENT MY CONSCIOUS INTENTION IS THE PROXITMATE CAUSE OF MY REACHING RIGHT I'M SO I'M THE OUT AND SO I'M THE AUTHOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS ESSENTIALLY AND I'M AND MY AND MY SPECIFIC USES OF ATTENTION RIGHTS I CAN I CAN PAY ATTENTION TO THE BREATH I GET LOST AN THOUGHT I COME BACK TO THE BREATH BI I'M YOU KNOW THE LOT THAT THA INS ON SOME LEVEL THE THOUGHTS THEMSELVES ARE MORE OR OF MY DOING SOMETHING I WITH WITH ALMOST A YOAUTHORIAL INTENT RIGHT LIKE I'M THINK LIKEYOUAT LOOK WHAT THE HELS HAS GOT TALKING ABOUT I'M I KNOW I'M THINK YOU KNOW I KNOW IT IYOU KNOW WHO'SE THINKING THSE THOUGHTS I AM RIGHT LIE THATS THAT THE PERSON WHO REALLY DOESN'T GET WHAT I'M SAYING IS THINKING SOMETHING LIKE THAT RICE LIKE WHAT THE FUXS HAS GOT TALKING ABOUT LIKE I Y LIKE I KNOW I'M HERE I'M ASELF I'M YOU KNOW I'M I'M M A BODY O'M A MIND I CAN REACH FOR THINGS THAT THESE ARE THESE INTENTIONAL ACTIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO ME RIGHT IA VOLUNTARY ACTION IS DIFFEREN FROM AN INVOLUNTARY ONE YOU KNOW A HAVING A TREMOR IS DIFFERENT FROM CONSCIOUSLY DECIDING TO PICK UP A GLASS RECTI'M SO OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING I'M SAYING ABOUT MEDITATION AND THE SELF AND FREE WILL IN ORDER TO BE A SAME PICTURE OF A HUMAN MIND AND A REALITY HAS TO CONSERVE THE DATA OF EXPERIENCE SUCH THAT YES I CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TREMOR AND A A DELIBERATIVE OU KNO VOLUNTARY  MOTOR ACTION I'M AND IYOU KNOW AND THE THINGS YOU DO VOLITIONALLY ARE DIFFERENT NOT JUST PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND BEHAVIOURLY BUT THEY EDJUST HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR LIKE THY DIFIN A COURT OF LAW YOU KNOW YOU ACCIDENTALLY HIT SOME ONE WITH YOUR CAR OR YOU DIDNIT ON PURPOSE THAT STILL AT A DISTINCTION THAT MATTERS RIGHT IT'S IN IMPORTANTLY TELLS US A LOT ABOUT THE GLOBAL PROPERTIES OF YOUR MIND SUCH THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO DO IN THE FUTURE YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO LIKES RUNNING OVER PEOPLE WITH YOUR CAR YOU KNOW YOU'RE A A PSYCHO PATH WHO WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT YOU'RE SOME ONE WHO DID BY ACCIDENT WELL THEN YOU KNOW YOU MAY BE I CULPABLE FOR FOR THE LEVEL OF NEGLIGENCE THAT TA ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN BUT YOURS YOU'RE VERY DFFERENT PERSON AND WE WE WE TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY AND WE WERE WISE TO I'M SO NY WE WECAN THOSE ITLESS BRACK AT ALL OF THAT I'M THERE'S THIS MEN THERE'S SOME FUNDAMENTAL THTHERERE SOME FALSE ASSUMPTIONS OF BOU THE UNDERLYING LOGIC OF THIS PROCESS WHICH I THINK IT'S WORTH ADDRESSING AND IT IS ACTUALLY I WAS A CONOF FOUND OBJECT IN THE NEWS THAT I I I TALK ABOUT AT ONE POINT I FORGET WERE IT ISN'T IN IN THE WAKING A BAP BUT THRE'S A STORY HTHATTHI STUMBLED ON ON THE INTERNETT A I THIKGS ABOUT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS OLD OF A I'M A TOURIST BUS IN I THINK WAS NORWAY WHO SHAT SOMEWHONE IS IN A NORTHERN EUROPE AND HAD ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE ON IT AND ONE PERSON WASN'T WAS A DESCRIBED AS AN ASIEN WOMAN A ANDTHE ALL THE  WENT THEY WENT TO A REST STOP AND EVERYONE GOT OFF THE BUS A AND THEY YOU KNOW SHOPPED AND HAD LUNCHEON AND THAT THIS AEN WOMAN CHANGED HER CLOTHING A FOR WHATEVER REASON AND THEY ALL GOT BACK ON THE BUS A I THINK THE RELEVANCE OF IT BEING AN IN WOMAN IS OFTHE LANGUAGE BARRIERS THAT THAT THAT EXPLAINED WHAT LATER HAPPENED I SO EVERYONE GETS BACK ON THE BUS THE ASEN WOMAN HAS CHANGED HER HER CLOTHING AND THE BUSS IS ABOUT TO LEAVE BUT THEN SOME ONE NOTICE AS HAY THAT THERES  HERE WAS AN ASIN WOMAN WO GOT OFF THE BUS WHO ISN'T IT HASN'T COME BACK YET AND THE TELL THE DRIVER THIS I AND THI SPOSES E PROBLEMS NOW EVERY ONE'S WAITING FOR THIS PERSON TO RETURN BUT IN FACT EVERYONE WAS ON THE BUS THAT THIS WOMAN HAD JUST CHANGED HER CLOTHING WAS NOT RECOGNIZED BY HER FELLOW TRAVELLERS A SO EVERYONE GETS CONCERNED AS THIS THIS TOURIST DOESN'T YOU KNOW SHU SHOW UP AND THEY START LOOKING FOR RIGHT AND THEY CAN'T FIND HER AND SO A SEARCH PARTY IS FORMED AND THE ASIEN WOMAN BECAUSE OF THE WHATEVER LANGUAGE BARRIER A THOUGHT I HERD THAT THERE WAS A MISSING TOURST SO SHE JOINS THE SEARCH PARTY WHICH IN FACT IS LOOKING FOR HER RIGHT AND THIS GOES ON INTO THE NIGHT AND THEIR READYING HELICOPTERS THAT IN A FURTHER A DAWN PATROL TO FIND THE MISIMISSING TOURIST  NOW IT' SOME POINT ALONG THE WAY I THINK WAS IT LIKE THREE IN THE MORNING THIS TOURIST REALIZES THAT SHE IS THE OBJECT OF THI SEARCH RIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY THE WHOLE THING UNRAVELS SHE SHE CONFESSES THAT SHE CHANGED HER CLOTHES AND YOU KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM ISSOLVED BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED BY THE THE LOJIC THAT THE SEEKER IS EXPECTED RIGHT SOS LIKE IT'S NOT TRUE TO SAY THAT THE MISSING TOURIST WAS FOUND IN IN THE WAY THAT WAS EXPECTED RIGHT CAUSE A MISSING TOURIST WAS NEVER LOST THE MISSING TOURIST WAS PART OF THE SEARCH PARTY RIGHT AND SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM HER POINT OF VIEW LIKE WHAT HAPPENED SHE'S PART OF THE SEARCH PARTY SHE'S LOOKING FOR THE MISSING TOURIST NOT KNOWING THAT THE SHE IN FACT IS THE MISSING TOURIST SO WHAT HAPPENS AT THE MOMENT SHE REALIZES THAT EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR HER RIGHTLY WHAT WHAT IS THE THI SEARCH ISN'T CONSUMMATED IN THE WAY THAT IS IMPLIED BY THE LOJECT OF EVERYONE'S USE OF ATTENTION I AND YET THE PROBLEM EVAPORATES AND THERE'S SOMETHING DEEPLY ANALOGUS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THAT AND THE THE THE MEDITATIVE J EARNING  IT PRECISELY IN AGAIN NOT TALKING ABOUT ALL THE CHANGES IN THE E POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE CONSTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT COULD BE GOOD WHICH AGAIN CUT THAT COME ALONG FOR THE RIDE ANYWAY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO THE THING I'M TALKING ABOUT IT'S NOT ON THIS POINT OF LOOKING FOR THE CELF AND NOT FINDING IT AND THERE IS THE SENSE THAT OOK AT THE SELF IS HERE AND IT'S A PROBLEM IT IS THE THE STRING UPON WHICH ALL OF MY CONSCIOUS STATES MOSTLY UNHAPPY ONES ARE STRONG RIGHT IT'S IT'S THE THING THAT IS AT THE CENTRE OF MY ANXIETY IT'S IT'S IT'S THE IT'S THE THING THAT I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IS HE THING THAT ON CRITICISE I SORT OF LET IMPLOED I'M IT'S THE CENTRE OF MY PROBLEM AND NOW I'M TRYING TO FEEL BETTER AND MEDITATION HAS BEEN HANDED TO ME AS A AS A POSSIBLE YOU KNOW REMEDY FOR MY SITUATION AND AND IT'S BUILD IS A REMEDY IN FACT IT'S IT'S IT'S I'M I'M HEARING FROM THE SKY THAT THIS IS THE THING THAT IS GOING CAUSE ME TO REALIZE THAT MYSELF ISN'T WHERE YOU KNOW OR AS I THOUGHT IT WAS I'M SO NOWI'M GOING TO LOOK RIGHT AND SO AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE THE SENSE IS I START OUT FAR AWAY FROM THE GOAL HERE I START OUT WITH A PROBLEM I'M NOW MEDITATING ON THE EVIDENCE OF MY UNENLIGHTENMENT RIGHT I II CAN FEEL MY PROBLEM I FEEL THAT I'M DISTRACTED AND DISTRACTABLE AND I FEEL AS THE SORT OF CRAMP AT THE CENTERE OF MY LIFE THIT'S ME AND I'M NOT AS HAPPY AS I WANT TO BE I'M NOT AS CONFID AS I WANT TO BE I'M I'M MORE DISTRACTABLE THAN I WANT TO BE AND NOW I'M PAIN ATTENTION TO THE BREATH RIGHT I'M THIS IS WHAT THE SEARCH PARTY FEELS LIKE THIS IS WHAT THE THE CONFUSED TURIST FEELS LIKE IN HER OWN SEARCH PARTY AND SHE'S SHEIS LOOKING SHE'S LOOKING FOR THE MISSING PERSON AND THIS ORS ARE THE  THE ANGLE OF O YOU KNOW THE INCLINATION OF ALL OF THIS IS AND THE LOGIC OF IT IS ALL WRONG YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDABLY SO I GIVEN HOW WE WE ALL GET INTO THE SITUATION BUT YOU KNOW IT'S USEFUL TO CONTINUALLY TRY TO UNDER UNDERCUT IT AND I'M RECOGNIZE THAT THA THAT THE THING THAT'S BEING LOOKED FOR IS IS ACTUALLY RIGHT ON THE SURFACE WHICH IS EITHER  THE THERE IS NO ONE LOOKING THERE IS NO PLACE FROM WHICH YOU ARE PAIF YOURE PAIN ATTENTION TO THE BREATH OR TO SOUND OR NOTICING THE NEXT THOUGHT ARISE THIS SENSE THAT YOU ARE OVER HERE DOING THAT THING IS ACTUALLY WHAT IS LIKE TO BE THINKING AND NOT KNOWING THAT YOU'RE THINKING YOU'RE NOT THERE'S IT THERE'S A THOUGHT I'S AN UNDERCURRENT OF THOUGHT THAT'S GOING UNINSPECTED IN THAT MOMENT AND I'M SO THERE IS JUST A THERE'S A CONTINUALLY LOOKING FOR THE MIND A LOOKING FOR THE CENTRE OF EXPERIENCE A LOOKING FOR THE ONE WHO IS LOOKING WHICH AGAIN WHICH IS THE KIND OF THE THE ORIENTING PRACTICE HERE AND IT'S A LOT MORE I SAY ABOUT THIS OBVIOUSLY I'M OVER WAKING OUP BUT I'M IT'S IT'S THE EXPERIMENT YOU HAVE TO PERFORM IN ORDER TO GET READY TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS HOLT IS THE SEARCH PARTY YOU KNOW WAS FORMED IN IN ERROR ESSENTIALLY AND THAT THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TOTUSALVE WITH THIS PRACTICE DOES EVAPORATE IN IN A SIMILAR WAY WHICH IS LIKE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET THERE IN THE WAY THAT YOU'RE HOPING FOR RIGHT IS LIKE YLIKE YOU DROP OUT THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING IN A IN AN UNEXPECTED WAY IT'S NOT I'M TERE'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER A  CONE OFOF SIMILAR A'M PARABLE OR OR ANECDOTE THAT I DON'T NON REMEMBER ZEN OR SUFIER AND I'M SURE S BEEN REAPPROPRIATED IN A DIFFERENT WAYS BUT BY MANY DIFFERENT TRADITIONS BUT THERE'S THIS YOUN OF THE THE CASE OF SOMEBODY IS LOST IN A TOWN AND THERE THEY'RE ASKING FOR DIRECTIONS OU KNOW YOU CAN PUT THE PUT THIS IN IN IN MAN HATT AND OU CANLESSY WANDERING MANHATTAN IN YOUR YOU'R ATORISE YOU N KNOW WHERE ANYTHING ISN'T YOUS  STOP AND ASK SOME WONE YOU A WHAT YOU WEAR A CENTRAL PARK AND THE PERSON THINKS FOR A SECOND THEY SAYS I OH YI'M UNFORCEAT YOU CAN'T GET TO CENTRAL PARK FROM HERE RIGHT IF THAT IS A VERY STRANGE AND YET WEYOU THINK BOUT THAT FOR SECOND YOU REALIZE LOOKYT THT'S A AT'SN'T ABSURD CLIMB THERE IS NO PLACE THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO FROM THE PLACE YOU'RE STARTING YO KNOW ON EARTH RIGHT LIKE' NO AILIAR TO DESCRIBE THE PHYSICAL A RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ANYTHING AND THE WORLD YET THAT JUS NOT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN RIGHT SOMEBODY'S A FUNNY THING IS IT BUT IT BUT ON SOME LEVEL THAT IS TRUE OF MEDITATIONIS LIKE YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE LIKE THAT THE SENSE OF YOU THE SENSE OF YOU AS SUBJECT ISN'T BROUGHT ALONG TO THIS THING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT LIKE YOU ARE LIKE YOU'RE YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'SO MOS LIKE YOUR YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING A FIST AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO AN OPEN HAND THE FIST DOESN'T GET TO TAKE THAT JOURNEY AS A FIST RIGHTLY YOU DON'T THE FIST DOESN'T GO ALONG FOR THE RIDE THE FIST COMES A PART RIGHT AND AND ON SOME LEVEL THAT OUR SUBJECTIVITY IS A E KIND OF AN INTAN INTENN ATTENTIONAL FIST YOU KNOW IT'S IT IT IS A CONTRACTION OF ENERGY AGAIN IT'S IT' SO MUCH BOUND UP IN THOUGHT FOR FOR A MOST OF US MOST OF THE TIME THAT IS AND T T WHEN WHEN PROPERLY INSPECTED THERE'S JUST THIS YOU KNOW EVAPORATION OF THE STARTING POINT BUT THERE'S NOT THIS THERE'S NOT THIS FULFILLMENT OF I'M GOING TO GET THIS FIST IS GOING TO JUST GOING TO IF I YOU KNOW IF LIFE GETS GOOD ENOUGH IF I GET CONCENTRATED EN A FOCUS ENOUGH YOU KNOW IF I AUSTERE ENOUGH IF I RENOUNCE ENOUGH IF I DESIRE LESS IF I YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ENOUGH WITH ENOUGH GOOD AN AINTENTIONS THIS FIST IS GOING TO MOVE INTO SOME SORT OF SUBLIME CONDITION RIGHT THAT'S NOT THE LOGIC OF THE THE PROCESS I I REALLY PRE THESE A MODELS AND ANALOGIES FOR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE BOTH AS MOST PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THEM AND A HARBOR THEM IN ENCS AS A WAY TO FRAME WHAT'S POSSIBLE THROUGH A THROUGH A PROPER MEDITATION PRACTICE DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT A PROPER MEDITATION PRACTICE LOOKS LIKE A BIT BUT AT SOME POINT AM I DO WANT TO RAISE A A MODEL OF MAYBE EVEN JUST PERCEPTIOAL AWARENESS TO SEE IF IT A SURVIVES THE FILTERS AN AND YOUV PROVIDED A BUT FIRST JUST EVEN IF BRIEFLY IN THA WE CAND RETURN TO IT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THIS MEDITATION PRACTICE WHOARE SET OF PRACTICES LOOK LIKE OBVIOUSY A THE AP IS A WONDERFUL TOOL I'VE STARTED USING IT AS A MENTION THE BEGINNING MY MY FATHERS BEEN USING IT FOR WHILE IN MANY PEOPLE OF DRIVED GREAT BENEFIT FROM IT BUT IF WE WERE TO IN BREAK IT DOWN MEDITATION INTO SOME BASIC COMPONENT PARTS AS WE HAVE BROKEN DOWN A NORMAL PERCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE IN SOME OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS YO A I CAN JUST THROW OUT SOME THINGS THAT I ASSOCIATE WITH MEDITATION AND MAYBE YOU CAN ELABORATE ON UN HALLES MERE MAY NOT BE APPLIED FOR INSTANCE AM THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A A CEASING OF MOTOR ROBUST MOTOR MOVEMENT I KNOW THEIRE WALKING MEDITATION AND SO FORTH THAT SEEMS LIKE SITTING OR LYING DOWN AND PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN LIMITING OUR VISUAL PERCEPTION CLOSING THE EYES AM DIRECTING A MIND'S EYE SOME PLACE  IS THERE A DEDICATED EFFORT TOWARD GENERATING IMMAGERY AM WHAT ARE THE COMPONENT PARTS AND WHERE I'M REALLY GOING WITH THIS IS WHY WOULD THOSE COMPONENT PARTS EVENTUALLY ALLOW FOR THIS DISSOLUSION OF THE FIST OR THE AM THE REALIZATION THAT THERE IS NO AM DISTINCTION BETWEEN A ACTOR AN OBSERVER AND SOO YE THE I WILL SUBANCER THE SECOND QUESTION FIRST ULTIMATELY MEDITATION IS NOT A PRACTISE THAT YOU'RE ADDING TO YOUR LIFE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A DOING MORE OF ANYTHINGS THAT YOU ACTUALLY CEASING TO DO SOMETHING T IS ULTIMATELY NON DISTRACTION I MAY IT'S ULTIMATELY  RECOGNIZING WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE NO LONGER DISTRACTED BY THE THE AUTOMATIC ARISING OF OF THOUGHT ITS NOT THE THOUGHTS DON'T ARISE NOT THAT YOU CAN'T USE THEM AS NOT THAT YOU BECOME IRRATIONAL OR OR A I YOU KNOW UNINTELLIGENT TO ME I ALL THAT YOU  YOU STILL HAVE ALL YOUR TOOLS BUT THERE EVERY EVERYTHING IS IN PLAIN VIEW AN THERE THE'S AN ANALOGY AND INTO BENBUDDHISM WHICH I LOVE WHICH IS A YOU KNOW YOEU COME IN THE FINE OL STAGE OF MEDITATION A THOUGHTS ARE LIKE THIEVES ENTERING AN EMPTY HOUSE N NOW THERE'S NOTHING FOR THEM TO STEAL RIS OL U  IN THE USUAL CASE THOUGHTS ARE THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING IN JEOPARD HE EVERY TIME A THOUGHT COMES I'M NOT MEDITATING ANY MORE AND AND NOT ONLY THAT I FEEL TERRIBLE BECAUSE OF WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT MOST OF THE TIME RIGHT  AND SO IT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE AT THOUGHTS SEEM LIKE A PROBLEM IN THE BEGINNING AND YO FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MEDITATION THEY ARE EXPLICITLY THOUGHT OF AS A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU ARE TRINE TO FOKCUS ON ONE THING TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDING THOUGHT AND THAT IS A OU WHAT I CALL CONCENTRATION PRACTICE EARLIER AND THAT IS A YOU KNOW IT'S THAT'S A TRAINING THAT CAN BE GOOD TO DO IT BECOMES A TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE FOR THEOTHER KINDS OF OF OF INSIGHT BUT IS A VERY SPECIFIC ANDS KIND OF BRIDDLE SKILL IN THE END IMIS IIS IS TO SKILL JUST LIKE AM IN TO PAATTENTION OF ONE THING I'M A DO THAT SO WELL THAT EVERYTHING ELSES CAN A FADE OUT AND IT SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO WHAT YOU YOU DESCRIBED IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM IF YOU IF YOU YUIT ILAZER FOKUSS TO ONE VIXATION POINT EVERYTHING ELSE IN YOUR VISUAL FIELD BEGINS TOF TO FADE OUT BUT BUT MEDITATIVELY IF YOU HAVE A LAZER FOCUS ON ANY ONE THING WHAT WHETHER'S THE BREATH OR OR YOU KNOW A CANDLE FLAME WHATEVER IT IS YOU NOT ONLY TIT DOS ME FLISLIS UVS THE BREATH FOR YOU KNOW FOR A SECOND A CAUSE YOUR EYES ARE CAN BE CLOSED A IN YOU CAN LOSE ALL SENSE OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN LOSE ALL SENSE OF HEARING AND YOUYOURE YOUR PHYSICAL BODY CAN DISAPPEAR AND I LIKE LITERALLY CAN BECOME INCREDIBLY  SUBTLE AND VAST AND DRUG LIKE A AND MANY PEOPLE APPROACH MEDITATION THINKING CONCLIMBING THE LATTER OF THOSE CHANGES INTO SUBTLETY AND VASTNESS THAT'S THE WHOLE THAT'S THE WHOLE GAME RIGHT AND IT CAN BE A DEEPLY REWARDING GAME TO PLAY AND IT ALSO DOES COME WITH ALL KINDS OF ANCILARY BENEFITS A ME ALL THE FOCES AND THE CALM AND THE AND THE ECOND OF SMOOTHNESS OF EMOTIONAL STATES AN ME  ALL THAT COMES WITH GREATER CONCENTRATION AND IT IT CAN BE QUITE WONDERFUL A BUT AGAIND AT BEST THAT'S A TOOL TO AIM IN THE DIRECTION THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT NOW WITH WITH RESPECT TO MEDITATION WHICH RELATES TO MORE OR WHAT I WOULD CALL IN A MINDFULNESS GENERICALLY A AND ULTIMATELY CANE I'M NON DUAL MINDFULNESS SO MINDFULNESS GENERICALLY AND FOR FOR MOST PEOPLE CERTAINLY IN IN THE BEGINNING DUALISTICALLY IS JUST THE PRACT IS OF PAIN CAREFUL ATTENTION TO WHATEVER IS ARISING ONEST OWN RIGHT NOW IN THE BEGINNING IT'S IT'S IT'S NATURAL TO TAKE A SINGLE OBJECT LIKE THE BREATH AS A STARTING POINT IS NOT OF AN ANCER A BUT YOU KNOW VERY VERY QUICKLY OWING OVER THE COURSE OF EVEN IN YOUR FIRST WEAK OF DOING THIS PEOPLE UYOU KNOWTEACHERS AND YOU KNOW A VARIOU SOURCES OF INFORMATION WILL RECOMMEND THAT WHEN ONCE YOU GET SOME PACILA AT ONE YOT ONCE YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING LOST IN THOUGHT AND ACTUALLY PANATTENTION TO THE BREATH WELL THEN YOU CAN OPEN IT UP TO EVERYTHING YOU KNOW T  SOUNDS AND OTHER SENSATIONS IN THE BODY AND AND A MOOD S IN EMOTIONS AND EVEN ULTIMATELY THOUGHTS THEMSELVES AND SO VERY QUICKLY YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THAT THOUGHTS ARE NOT INTRINSICALLY THE ENEMY TO THIS PRACTISE THEY ARE ALSO JUST SPONTANEOUS APPEARANCES IN CONSCIOUSNESS THAT CAN BE OBSERVED A BUT FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT THERE IS A PLACE FROM WHICH THAT OBSERVATION AS HAPPENING RIGHT THERE IS JUST SAY YU KNOW IAM NOW THE ONE WHO'S BEING MINDFUL A AND HOWEVER A TENUATED THAT SENSE OF SELF CAN BE AND MAGAN I CAN YOU CAN GET VERY EXPANSIVE AND YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN LOSE YOUAS YOU GET ANYTHING JUST A MONICUM OF CONCENTRATION YOU KNOW IT BECOMES VERY DRUG LIKE AND YOU GET YOU KNOW YOU YEUT THE THE BOUNDARIES OF YOUR BODY DISOLVE THAN YOU FEEL FEELING OF HAVING A BODY CAN DISAPPEAR AND A AND YOU YOU KNOW IF YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED YOU KNOW YOUR VISUAL FEEL CAN MAY MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY CLOSE OUR EYES INITIALLY THEY JUST FORGET ABOUT THEIR VISUAL FIELD BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES RIGHT NOW YOU KNOTICE YOUR VISUAL FEEL IS FULLY PRESENT AND YOU KNOW IT'S YOU RECALL IT DARK BUT IS NOT QUITE DARK THERE IS A SORT OF SCINTILATING A SOME FIELD OF OF OF COLOR AND SHADOW A THAT'S THERE BEIN THE DARKNESS OF YOUR CLOSED EYES AND THAT CAN BECOME A SKY LIKE DOMAIN OF ON  VAST A A OU KNO VISUAL EXPRESSION THAT OPENS UP AS YOU AS YOU GET MORE CONCENTRATE WITH YOU KNOW WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED RIGHT SO YOU SO YOU CAN VERY MUCH BE AWARE OF SEEING WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED N IN MEDITATED PRACTICE A BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MINDFULNESS THE LOGIC IS NOT TO CARE ABOUT ANY OF THE INTERESTING CHANGES IN EXPERIENCE THAT COME AS A RESULT OF PRACTISING IN THIS WAY BECAUSE WHAT YOU WHIT TH THE THE UNDERLYIN GOAL IS IS TO BE MORE AND MORE AQUANIMOUS WITH CHANGES SO'S NOT TO GRASP UT WHAT'S PLEASANT OR INTERESTING AND NOT TO PUSH WHAT'S UNPLEASANT OR OR OU KNO BORING OR OR YOU KNOWR OTHERWISE NOT ENGAGING AWAY A WHAT YOU WANT IS JUST A KIND OF A SKY LIKE MIND THAT JUST ALLOWS EVERYTHING TO APPEAR AND YOU'RE NOT CLINGING TO ANYTHING OR OR OR REACTING TO ANYTHING COULD ASK YOU WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCEIS BETWEEN NOUNS AJUCTIVES AND VERBS IN THE CONTEXTS OF WHAT WE'RE STALKING ABOUT IN YOUR DESCRIBING AND THERE EASON BRING THES ELF IS THAT A AS YOU KNOW I KNOW EVERYTHING BIOLOGY IS A PROCESS YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD NEVER EVER SAY OH YOU KNOW THE PERCEPTION OF THAT RED LINE ON A PAINTING IS UN IS A NOWN RIGHT I ME ITIT'S AN EVENT IN DIVISUAL SYSTEM OUR YOURE ABSTRACTING SOME UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THAT THING IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND I THINK IT'S VERY USEFUL IN THINKING ABOUT THE BRAIN A IN A PEOPILL KNOW US I NOTICE HAT I EXCUSE ME ACTIVELY AVOID THE USE OF THE WORD MINE BECAUSE I FIGURE I ESPECIALLY WITH YOU SITTING ACROSS FROM ME THAT A'LL A A STEP IN IT IF I IF I DO BUT THE BRAIN GENERATES A SERIES OF PERCEPTIONS OR WOULD HAVE YOU BY THROUGH PROCESSES NOT NOUNS AND SO WHEN THING ABOUT BIOLOGY I THING OF DEVELOPMENT IS A IS A IS AN ARK OF PROCESSES AM AGING IS AN ARK OF PERCEPTION IS AN ARCIT PROCY THEY JUST EXIST ON DIFFERENT TIME SKILES AND SO A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT INSIDE OF AN EFFECTIVE MEDITATION PRACTICE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF IT OF A AM CERTAINLY NON JUDGEMENT BUT DISCARDING OF THE THE NOUN AND THE ADJECTIVE A MODES OF LANGUAGE LIKE RED APPLE OK IT'S A RED APPLE BUT THEN YOU SE NEED TO ELIMINATE SOME OTHER ADJECTIVES ABOUT IT'S A ROTTEN APPLE IT'S A IN A RIPE APPLE AND INSTEAD VIEW THE APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THAT APPLE AS A IT'S JUST A THING A PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO AN EVENT AND NOW EVENTS COULD WE COULD REALLY GET INTO THE LANGUAGE ASPECT OF THE DUCHESS REVEALS HOW AM DIMINISHED LANGUAGEIS TO DESCRIBE THE WORKINGS OF THE BRAIN AT SOMELEVEL AM I DON'T O IF ANY OF THIS RESINATES BUT IT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THE GOAL OR ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO START TO UNDERSTAND THE ALGARITHM THAT IS THE FLEETING NATURE OF PERCEPTION BUT DO NOT FOCUSS ON ANY ONE SINGLE PERCEPTION AND THEN DO NOT EVEN FOCUS ON ONE SINGLE ALGARITHM BUT TO AT SOME LEVEL THERE SAY AM WHAT IS REVEALED TO THE MEDITATOR OVER TIME IS SOME  SORT OF MACROSCOPIC PRINCIPLE ABOUT AM THE WAY PERCEPTIONS WORK AT A DEEPER LOVE RIGHT THAT THERE THAT THERE SERV A A DEEPER PRINCIPLE THERE THAT SITS BELOW AR NCERTAINLY OUR NORMAL EVERYDAY AWARENESS BUT THAT IN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE MECHANICS OF ALL THE STUFF AND NOT JUDGING THOSE MECHANICS NOT NAMING THOSE MECHANICS OR JUST NAMING THEM AND LET THEMT PASS BY THAT THERE'S SOME ACTION FUNCTION SOME VERB IS EREAL AND THAT MAYBE THAT VERB MAYBE THE WORD TO DESCRIBE THAT VERBIS MINDFULNESS MAYBE MINDFULNESS IS IS REALLY JUST A VERB TO DESCRIBE THAT I DON'T KNOW AM BUTIS THERE ANYTHING HERE A MI CREATI MI OI'E CREATING JUST LIKE USELESS STRAW OR IF THERE'S IF THERE'S ACTUALLY A SEED HERE OF SOMETHING REAL BUT TO ME ANY TIME I ONT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IN BIOLOGY ERE PSYCHOLOGY I TRAIN UM BROUGHT IN THE TIME DOMAIN AN THINKING TERMS OF VERBS NOT NOUNS OR ADJECTIVES YOUR YER NO THETHAT'S VERY USEFUL AND THAT'S SOMEWHAT A JASE AND TO THIS DISTINCTION I MAKING BETWEEN DUALISTIC AN NONDUALISTIC WAYS OF EXPERIENCING THE WORLD ISO EVEN OU DUALISTICALLY EVERYTHING IS STILL A PROCESS RIGHT AND AND WE'RE MISLED BY THE REIFICATION THE NOUN TALK IGIVES US SO AND THIS THIS APPLY IS NOT JUST TO  SOMETHING LIKE MINFULNESS BUT EVEN TO SOMETHING LIKE THESELF RIGHT SO THE SENSE OF SELF I'S ALSO A PROCESS AND IS IS S ITSUVERB I 'S NOT IT'S A WORK WORTH SELFING MORE THAN WE ARSELVES RIGHT AND IM AND THERE YOU KNOW I EVEN EVEN APPROPRIATE USES OF OF THE TERMSELF THAT DON'T GO AWAY EVEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THE THE THE COR SUBJECTSELF IS AN ILLUSION THE'RE THER STATES OF SELF RIGHT WERE YOU YOU CAN RECOGNIZING YOUR LIFE THAT YOU INHABIT VERY DIFFERENT MODES OF OF BEING DEPENDING ON THE CONTECT SO LIKE THEIR MOMENTS WHERE YOU JUST BY WALKING INTO A CERTAIN BUILDING YOU SUDDENLY TRANSITION INTO A DIFFERENT STATE OF SELF LIKE LIKE SUDDENLY YOU PASS THROUGH A DOORE AND NOW YOU ARE A CUSTOMER IN A STORE RIGHT SO WE KNOW WHAT THAT CUSTOM OR FEELING IS LIKE YOU'RE NOW THE PERSON WHOSE GETTING THE ATTENTION IS A VERY KIND OF FORMALIZED TYPE OF ATTENTION FROM THE PERSON WHO IS RUNNING THE STORE AND YOU KNOW ORE A RESTAURANT YOUR CUSTOMER AND A RESTAURANT RIGHT THAT' SAY I I JUST REMEMBERS OF THIS KOND OF FUNNIN I THAT'S A IT WAS BORN OF A MISMATCH O OF THIS I'LL COME BACKE NESS IIM BUT M SO THERE A  SO WE WOULD GO THOUGH YOU CAN BE YOU KNOW YOUYOU CAN BE A STUDENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A TEACHER YOU CAN BE APPARENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A OF A SON OR A DAUGHTER YOU CAN BE ASPOUSE AND PRESENCE IN THE PRESENT OF YOUR SPOUSE AND ALL OF THOSE SHADINGS OF YOULIKE THI THE CHANGE IN CONTEXT I REALLY DOES USHERING SOME FUNDAMENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN JUST THE STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU I D AND IT'S AND SOME OF THIS IS REALLY IMEI'M SURE WE CAN UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT THIS BEEN O PERSONALLY AND AND YOU O GENERICALLY BUT IT IS PRETTY MYSTERIOUS A MAN I COMING THEIR PEOPLE WHO I KNOW WHOM I KNW I'M WITH THEM IN A CERTAIN WAY AND LIKE BASED ON SOMETHING ON GETTING OFF OT THEM I I CAN'T BE THAT I I'M IM AM EFFORTLESSLY ONE WAY WITH THEM AND THERE'S NO WAY I COULD BE THAT WAY WITH SOMEBODY ELVE RIGHT LIKE IT'S JUST ON ON OGH IT'S PHARIMONDS OR THEIR IN THEIR FACO JUST THE WAY THEY ARE THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSION BUT  THAT THEI'RE PEOPLE WITH WHOM I'M REALLY CONT I EFFORTLESSLY FUNNY AND THEI'RE PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOUI COULDN'T EVEN IT WOULD NEVER OCCUR TO ME TO BE FUNNY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED YOU LESS LI AND AND I HAVE LIKE LONGSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH WITH THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW SELECE IT IT IS JUST VERY I YOU KNW ALL THAT'S VERY MYSTERIOUS BUT ANYWAY THE THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS IS NOT IN THIS CORE SENSE OF SUBJECT IN RELATIONSHIP TO ALL THE OBJECTS IT'S IN CON THE THE STATES OF SELF AND BUT AN AND ALL THAT IS JUST IS VERY VERBY RIGHT LIKE ALL THIS THIS PATTERN OF CHANGES IT'S A PATTERN OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE IND WHAT'S NOT AVAILABLE THE CAPACITIES THAT ARE YOU KNOW THET ARE THE COME ON LINE OR NOT IM IN IN THOSE VERIOUS CONTECTS I BUT NOW THE THE MEMORY JUST HAD WHICH I HAD HAD HAD A LONG TIME THIT WAS ONE THESE THESE MOMENTS WHERE I REALIZED THE POWER OF THESE SHIFTS IN CONTEXTS FOR STATES OF SELF SO I ONCE A I WAS E I'M A YOUNG MAN I THNK WAS I WAS I PROBABLY TWENTY TOR SO AND SINGLE AND LIKE YOU JUST LIKE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW HOW DO YOU MEET WOMEN AN LIKE HOW TOS HOW DOES ONE GET CONFIDENT TO DO THIS WELL AND I'M I IM I WALKED INTO A RESTAURANT AND A I'M O KIND OF A WOMAN WAS WALKING TOWARD ME I YOU KNOWYOU ITO TOWARD THE FRONT DOOR THE RESTIN BUT SHE 'S WALKING TOWARD ME IN AWAY WHERE I JUST BY DEFAULT ASSUMED SHE WAS THE HOSTESS IN THE RESTAURANT I BUT SHE WASN'T AS THE HOSTESS SHEU WAS JOT SAY A IM YOU KNOW SOME ONE WHO JUST EATEN THERE I GUESS IM SO I WALKED THROUGH AND SHE COMES OUT AN SOT THAT THAT T FINT ABOUT MISUNDERSTANDING IN ME THAT SET UP BY LITTLE JUST THIS CHANG ING ARCHITECTURE AND I AND SO I JUST SET HIGH TO HER IN A WAY THAT I WOULD I PRESUMABLY I WOULD SAY HIGH TO ANY HOSTESS WHO WAS COMING UP TO TO ASK ME WHETHER WERE I WANT TO SIT 'M BUT WHAT ID ACTUALY HAPPENED AS I HAD SAIT HIGH TO A TOTAL STRANGER IN A WAY THAT I TENDED AT THAT POINT NEVER TO SAY HIGH TO TELL STRANGERS CAUSE I WAS SHY AND U KNOW JUST SA I'M BUT APPARENTLY I GAVE HER LIKE A TEN THOUSAND WHAT HOT YOU KNOW HIGH OF LIKEA LEE ALL OF THE CONFIDENCE YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU IF YOU WERE THAT SORT OF PERSON AND IT JUST USHERED IN A COMPLETE LIKE YOU KNOW THIS IS SO I WENT TO MY TABLE AND THIS WOMAN I CAME BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT LIKE GAVE ME HER FONE NUMBER RIGHT WHICH WAS SOMETHING IT WAS JUST THAT YOUGOT COMPLETELY FOREIGN EXPERIENCE TO ME YOU KNOW ND IT WAS BASE COMPLETELY ON MY MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION I WAS RIGHT AND AND SO ANYWAY THAT AMONG THE UNDERSTANDING US AMONG THE MISUNDERSTANDING THAT ONE CAN HAVE AND THEN I'M ACTION ENGAGE IN LIFE I AE THAT WAS OF SOME ONE OF DAPPENONE YET YOUT KNNW BUT BUT THEN YOU REALIZE THAT OOKUET BUT THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO RECOGNIZE THIS MACHINERY TO WHATEVER DERE OR HAVE N ONNATURAL APTITUDES FOR BRINGING CERTAIN THINGS ON LINE OR NOT SUCH THAT O KAE THEY CAN MAKE THESE STATE THEY CAN CONSCIOUSLY MAKE THESE STATES OF SELF YOU KOW THIS KIND OF THIS LEVEL OF GREGARIOUSNESS SAY AVAILABLE TO THEM INDIFFERENT YOU IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT'S IS ACTUAL USEFUL TO THET SIF IF YOU IF YOU'RE SINGLE AND YOU WANT TO MEET PEOPLE WELL AS IS IS ACTUALLY VERY HELPFUL TO TO FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH THE JUST SAY HIGH TO STRANGER IS AND OS SOMEHOW THEY'RE DOING ANNNTO BE TO BE KNW ON LINE  YOU KNOW IN THAT WAY WHERE AT THAT POINT IN MY LIFE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE YOU KNOW BY HAT YOU KNOW BY DEFAULT I WAS GOING T IGNORE THIS STRANGER WHO I WAS PASSING BY IN THE DOORWAY OF A RESTAURANT BUT THINKING SHE WAS THE HOSTESS I WAS ENGAGING HER YOU KNOW FULLY I'M SO ANYWAY YOU CAN CONSCIOUSLY AGAIN THIS DOES NOT INVOKE FREE WILL AT ALL BUT YES YOU CAN CONSCIOUSLY SIDE TO  PLAY WITH THIS WITH THESE MECHANISMS SUCH THAT YOU CAN DECIDE YOU WHAT STATE STATES OF SELF I WOULD BE MORE NORMATIVE TO HAVE ON A GIVEN WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE AND AND YOU CAN BECOME INCREASINGLY YOU KNOW ATTENTIVE TO THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU GET PLAYED BY THE WORLD YOU KNOW YOUAR KIND OF INSTRUMENT YOUR MIND IS A KIND OF INSTRUMENT YOUR BRAIN AS A KIND OF INSTRUMEN THITIS CONTINUALLY GETTING PLAYED BY THE SITUATIONS YOU WERE IN AND YOU CAN BECOME MORE OF I AND INTELLIGEN CURATOR OF YOUR CONSCIOUS STATES IN YOUR CONSCIOUS CAPACITIES JUST BY NOTICING THE CHANGES IN YOU LIKE I I IN GRADUATE SCHOOL THIS SOME HAHAD TALK ABOUT I THINK IT SOME POINT IN WAKING UP THIS BECANG VERY STARK FOR ME BECAUSE I HAD IM YOU KNOW I WAS A YOU NW AN OLD GRADUATES DO AND IAD HAD TAKEN ELEVEN YEARS OFF AT STANDFORD UYU BETWEEN MYSOPH MORN JUNIOR YEAR WRIGHTS I LIKE WHEN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL LK ABOUT A LEVING THET YETIT WAS YETBUT  MIT TIS O STAMFORD AT THIS YOUA YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS IM THEY HAVE THE STOP OUT POLICY WERE YOU NEVER REALLY DROP OUT YOU JUST STOP ASTER YOU I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK AND DON'L HAVE TO WRITE LETTERS SAYING THAT YOU STILL EXIST EVERY OF TWO YEARS AS YOU DO IN OTHER SCHOOLS SO ANYWAY I SHOWED UP AFTER ELEVEN YEARS AND BUT YOU NOW O I WAS REALLY ON A DEAD LINE AND I FELT LATE FOR EVERYTHINGS ON OND OF OU A FINISHING MY DEGREE IN AS QUICKLY AS I CAN I'M AS NON TO GRADUATE THAN I JUMP IN TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND I'M AN OLD RADUAS DOING AND I'M YOU KNOW I THIRE'S REAL SENSE OF CON OF URGENCY LIKE I'M LATE II SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS EARLIER I WANTO GET THE STUFFD DONE IM BUT THEN NINE ELEVEN HAPPENED AND I YOU ASK JUST AS I HAD FINISHE MY CORSE CWORK AT YOU OF GETTING MY MY PAGETY I I WAS JUST GETTIN INTO MY RESEARCH BUT NINE ELEVEN INTERSECTED WITH MY LIFE IN SUCH A WAY THAT I JUST HAD TO DROP EVERYTHING AND WRITE MY FIRST BOOK AND I DID THAT AND THEN I JUST HAD TO DROP EVERYTHING IN WRITE MY SECOND BOOK BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE TO THE FIRST BOOK AND SO AS SENTIALLY I HAD LIKE FOUR YEARS WHERE I WAS A WALL D DOING MY PAGETY BUT I WAS STILL HAD A TOE IN THE LAG AND I WAS STILL SHOWING UP OCCASIONALLY BUT I WAS BECOMING THIS KIND OF CAUTIONARY TALE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF GRAD SCHOOL BUT IWAS ALSO BECOMING HIE A FAMOUS YOU R SEND MY FAMOUS A WRITER IK AS MY FIRST BOOK HAD BEEN AT N YOUARK TIMES BEST CELLER AND I I JUST I WAS YOU KNOSS I WAS GETTING SOME NOTORIETIES OR A WRITER AND  SI WAS DOING THINGS LIKEIN I WAS GIVING A TEAD TALK BUT I STILL HADN'T FINISHED GRADUAL SCHOOL WRIGHT SO LIKE IT WAS JUST IT WAS SOME I THINK THAT TIME IU'S WRITE MAYBE I HAD JUST FINISHED GRADUAL SCHOOL WHEN I GEGET THE TED TALK BUT I'M ANYWATE SID I WAS IN ROWING IN TWO BOATS AND ONE BOAT WAS SINKING OR YOUARE SHOWING EVERY SOSIGN OF OF BEING DAMAGE AND I WAS LITERALLYLY LIKE IN A OUNO GETTING LETTERS FROM THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT IWERE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I WAS LIKE BECOMING A YOU KNOW BUT THE QUASY CELEBRITY IN THAT WORLD TOO IM OU  A LEAST IN A WORLD THAT WAS OVERLAPPING SO I WAS HAVING THE EXPERIENCE OF LIKE GOING IN TH THE MOMENT WERE THIS CRYSTALLIZED WITH FOR ME IN A IN A FAIR LY PECULIAR WAY WAS I HAVE A MEETING IT LIKE THREE O'CLOCK WITH MY ADVISER WHO IS JUST THI I MARK COIN AN THE BRAIN MAPPING CENTER AN TYOU SEE HI AS A FANTASTIC I I'M GREAT ADVISER I I DID NOT EXTRACT AS MUCH WISDOM FROM HIM AS I SHOULD HAVE I'M BRILLIANT SCIENTIST AND OU KNOW HE'S FOR HIM I'M LATE R AT LEAST IN MY HEAD LIKE HE IS NOT THAT HE WAS RIGHTING ME SO HARD BUT LIKE AT MY HEAD I'M VERY SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT HOW I'M NOT LIVING UP HIS EXPECTE EXPECTATIONS AT THIS POINT I'M SO I HAVE A MEETING WITH HIM T LIKE THREE O'CLOCK AND I'M JUST KIND O WILTING YOU KNOW UNDER MIGHT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HIS GAZE AN MY OWN IMAGINED YOU KNOW INNER GAZE OF HIS I'M YOU KNOW BUT THAT TWO HOURS LATER I HAVE A MEETING WITH HIS BOSS YOU KNOW A DINNER MEETING WITH HIS BOSS WHO WANTS TO MEET WITH ME TO GET ADVICE ON LAUNCHING HIS BOOK WE HAVE THE SAME PUBLISHER BUT I'M LIKE THE MUCH BIGGER AUTHOR AT YOU KNOW ADNORTON YOU KNOW AND AND HES'S COMINGTO ME FOR ADVICE I'M AND SO I'M RICK ASHAMED BETWEEN TWO DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE SELF STATES THAT IE AGAIN THIS COMES DOWN TO ARCHITECTURE AS LITERALLY LIKE THE STATE I WAS IN WALKING INTO ONE BUILDING AND THEN LEAVING AND WALKING INTO ANOTHER BUILDING ON THE SAME CAMPAS I'M AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY OPPOSITE SELF CONCEPTS LIKE AN ON IN IN ONE CONTECT I'M A FUCK U IN ANOTHER CONTECTS I'M A CELEBRITY THEN YOU HAVE MASTERY AND VIRTUACITY AND YAND AND WERE DEVELOPING IT VERY QUICKLY YE AND  BUT SO BEGAIN THIS A KIND OF STARK VERSION OF THAT BUT EVERY ONE HAS SOME VERSION OF THIS JUST IN BOUNCING BETWEEN TALKING TO THEIR MAM AND THEN TALKING TO A THEIR BEST FRIEND AND THEN TALKING TO A STRANGER THAN AND TO TALKING TO SOME ONE WHO'S WHO'S VERY SUCCESSFUL TALKINGTO SOME ONE IS NOT VERYC LIKE ALL YOU NOTICE YOU'R VULNERABILITY TO ALL OF THIS STUFF AND ULTIMATELY WHAT YOU WANT IS A LEVEL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL INTEGRITY THAT THAT IS TRULY DIVORCIBLE FROM THAT NOW THAT YOU I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE EVER GOING TO GET AT PERFECT  YOU KNOW THIS THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME I MEAN IT I I CAN'T I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE ULTIMATE FULFILMENT OF THIS PROCESS LIKE I'M NOT I'M NOT YOU KNOW I'M NOT A BUDDHA I MUST SAYING I' I I FINISHD THE PROJECT BUT I'M I THINK THERE'S MORE AND MORE YOU YOU KNOW AS YOU BECAM BECOME SENSITIVE TO THESE CHANGES AND YOU BECOME SENSITIVE TO WHAT IS LIKE TO ACTUALLY NOT BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY REACTIVE AND I NOT BE DEFINABLE BI YOUR OWN SELF CONCEPT YOURE OWN IYOU'ARE NOT IDENTIFYING WITH ANYTHING YOU'RE NOT HANGING YOUR HAT ON ANYTHING YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF IN TERMS IN IN ININ IN THE KIND OF TERMS THAT YOU WOULD EXPORT TO OTHERS AND THEN CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT YOU RIGHT LIKE YOUR THERE'S A KIND OF INVOLNERABILITY I THAT THAT ARISEIRS THIT'S NOT BORN OF BEING WELL DEFENDED IT'S BORN OF A A BEING EVAPORATED RIGHTS LIKE YOU'RE NO LONGER KEEPING SCORE IN THOSE WAYS I ONCE AGAIN WEREWE'RE AT THE I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT DESCRIPTION BECAUSE I THESE DAYS I'M I'M REALLY INTRIGUED BY IM SOMETHING WE'VEKNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT IM YOU CERTAINLY FAMILIAR WITH IS PREFUNTAF QUARTEXT AS ABILITY TO ESTABLISH CONTEXT DEPENDENT RULE SETS YOU KNOW A STROUP TASK WOILL BE A BASIC EXAMPLE OF IN READING NUMBERS OR LETTERS ON ON CARDS AND THEN SWHICHING TO HAVING TO REPORT THE COLORS OF THE LETTERS ARE REMBERS ARE WRITTEN IN BASIC TASK BUT FREEVFON THE QUARTEXTS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR SETTING CONTEXT DEPENDENT THOUGHT AND BEHAVIOUR IN DIRECTED ACTION AN AT AN BUT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT IM VARIATIONS OF THE SELF DEPENDING ON GRADUATE SCHOOL OR YOU KNOW RELATIONSHIP WERE SITTING ALONE IN ONE'S ROOM YET THEIRE DIFFERENT RULE SETS ARISE BUT IN SOMEHOW WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE A SENSE A COHERENT SENSE OF SELF THAT ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THOSE I'M FUNCTIONAL PEOPLE CAN IU A TOGGLE BETWEEN THEM AS NEEDED AND NOT OVERLAP THEM INAPPROPRIATELYLES NOT THE EXTENT THAT IT'S IM CAREER FAILING OR LIFE FAILING ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SAD EXAMPLES OF THAT UM MANY OF WHICH EXIST IN A THE TWITTER SPACE II KNOW SEVERAL COLLEGUES NOT DIRECTLY OF MIND BUT PEOPLE WHO IM THROUGH MISTAKES MADE WITH THEIR THUMBS WHERE THEY FORGOT CONTEXT I ERE FORGOT TO REALIZE THAT THE CONTEXT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS NEAR INFINITE BUT A CONTET TAT EXIST IN THEIR HEAD MIGHT NOT BE CLEAR IN THE WAY THAT THEY COMMUNICATED SOMETHING AND THEY LOST THEIR JOPS BY SAYING WHAT WERE PERCEIVED AS INSENSITIVE THINGS IN SOME CASES WE'RE IN FACT OFFENSE OFE INSENSIVE THINGS IN SOME CASES ITS DEBATABLE RIGHT IM IN ANY CASE I THINK THAT THE TH THE IMAGE THAT NOW COMES TO MIND OR WRELATES TO SOMETHING YOU SAID SEVERAL TIMES THAT I'M IT'S NOT ABOUT ELIMINATING SOMETHING IT'S ABOUT REVEALING THAT SOMETHING WAS NEVER ACTUALLY THERE AND THEN IN TERMS OF SENSURY EXPERIENCE IND THIS THESE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SELF HAVE THIS IMAGE IN MY MIND OF OF IM I'D NOT AN EXPERIENCED CU BADIVER BUT I'VE DONE ENOUGH OF IT IN A BORNA WET SUIT YOU WEARE COMPLETE WETS IT WITH THE HOOD AND THIS IDEA YOU KNOWIF YOUARE BORN INTO THAT WET SUIT YOU MIGHT THINK THAT NOW YOU YOU NOGEUP OR LEAN UP AGAINST A WALL AND YOU EXPERIENCE IT ONE WAY RIGHT AND UM BUT WERE YOU TO SHED THAT WET SUIT YOU  WILTHERS THI INCREDIBLE LANDSCAPE OF SOME ATISENSORY EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD NO IDEA THET GOES WAY BEYOND LEVELS OF SENSITIVITY RID KNOW YOU' CAN FINE TO POINT DISCRIMINATION AND LIGHT STROKES AND IS CO BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE PAIN IN OTHER WAYS TO BUT WEL YOU DESCRIBING AS A SENTURY THAT THE WET SUIT WAS NEVER REALLY THERE IT BUT WAS CREATED THROUGH A SERIES OF IN OF ACTION STEPS AN WHAT I THINK WHAT WERE A MIGRATING TOWARDS HERE IS A ED OF IM FOR MOST NONE INTO ITIVE IM OR NON REFLECTIVE ACTION STEPS THAT REVEAL TO US THAT IN FACT WE'RE NOT WEARING THE WEAT SUIT NOW YOU RAISED ONE AM TOPIC WHICH I I THINK IS ANALOGOUS TO THI SWEATSUT WHICH IS THIS NOTION OF DISTRACTION THEN NORMALLY DISTRACTION IS MASKING WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A A BETTER EXPERIENCE OF LIFE IM I CAN THINK OF DISTRACTION AS FALLING INTO TWO DIFFERENT BENS ONE WOULD BE THE KIND OF DISRACTION THAT IS INTERNALLY GENERATED LIKE THE FACT THAT THOUGHTS ARISE AND PULL ME DOWN DIFFERENT ALLEYWAYS AND AVENUES OF MY OF MY BRAIN IN MY THOUGHTS IN MY EXPERIENCE AND THEN THE OTHER WOULD BE A AN END THAT  THAT WOULD COMPETE WITH MY ABILITY TO REALLY FOCUS ON SOMETHING AND THEN ANOTHER FORM OF DISTRACTION WHICH CAPTURES MY ABILITY TO FOCUSE INTENSELY BUT HAS ME FOCUSSING ON THE WRONG THINGS AND HURE I THINKG THE JUDGMENT OF WRONG IS IT IS REASONABLE TO INCLUDE IF FOR INSTANCE I'M BEING IMPULSIVELY YANKE TO SOMETHING ON SOCIAL MEDIA I BEIG IMPULSIVELY YANK TO SOMEONE ELSE IS PAIN AND EXPERIENCE AND SOMEHOW CONFUSING THAT WITH MY OWN EXPERIENCE THIS IS AN EMPATHY BUT JUST IN YANKS AROUND MY ATTENTION AS A SPOTLIKE S CALLIC OVER HERE OVER THERE I'M NOT FEELING AS IF I'M THE ONE STANDING BEHIND THAT SPOT LIKE CONTROLMN OR I'M NOT THE SPOTLIKHT REMENT IS TO KEEP WITH THE WHELE WE'VE BEEN BUILDING UP HERE SO COULD YOU TELL US ALOIBIT ABOUT DISTRACTION AND TELL ME WHETHER NOT THESE TWO FORMS ARE IN ANY WAY ACCURATE OR IN ACCURATE I BE HAPPY FOR THEM TO BE INACCURATE ANWHETHER R NOT THER OTHER FORMS OF DISTRACTION THAT WE NEED TO BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR AND AGAIN I THINK WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE SEEKING IS WHAT IS THE WAY TO NUCH IS ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS BUT DISHED THIS WETS SU LIKE CLOAK THAT LIMITS OUR EXPERIENCE THAT I'M CALLING AN THAT YOU'VE CALLED DISTRACTION YEI GET WHAT THIS TM DISTRACTION AS IS ONE COMPONENOF IT THE OTHE OTHER HAT ASPECT OF IT IS IDENTIFICATION WITH THOUGHT I IDENTIICAT THAT  TH THE FEELING OF SELF IS BOUND UP IN THI SENSE THAT THAT I'M THE I'M THE THANKER I'M THE ONE ATTENDING I'M THE ONE VULNER ON THE INNERKIND OF THE INNER HOMUNCULUS THATS VULNERABLE TO EXPERIENCE I'M AND THINK IT CAN BE GRATIFIED BY IT OR NOT AND IT'S CONSTANTLY TRYING TO IMPROVE IT OR INMITIGATE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF IT I'M IS TH IS THE SENSE THAT THERE IS KIND OF A A RIDE OR ON THE HORSE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS SUPPOSED O JUST CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS CONTENTS SO IT AGAIN IT IF IT RISE ATOP THIS ILLUSION OF CONTROL I'M ET CETERA SO TOTO GO ALL WAY BACK TO TO THE THE QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT JUST WHAT IS IN I WHAT I RECOMMEND AS A STARTING POINT FOR FOR MEDITATION IM SOME OF YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE IN FACT TRUE YES MITS IT'S IT'S I OFTEN RECOMMEND THE BEGINING PEOPLE CLOSE THEIR EYES AND YOUUU  DO A SITTING PRACTIS OF AT AN IN TIT'S DIFFERENT FROM A WALKING PRACTICE AND YOU CAN DO BOTH BUT PEOPLE TEND TO START YOU AR SITTING WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED BUT AGAIN ULTIMATELY WHERE THIS IS GOING IS IT'S NOT AN ART OF MEDITATION PROPERLY RECOGNIZE IS NOT AN ARTIFICE THAT YOU'RE ADDING TO YOUR LIFE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EVEN A PRACTICE IT IS IT IS LESS RATHER THAN MORE YOU KNOW AND AND THEREFORE IT IS ALL SO COINCIDENT WITH A YOUEVERPOTENTIALLY EVERY WAKING MOMENT THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO WIH YOUR ATTENTION ONCE YOU KNOW HOW TO MEDITATE THAT INPRINCIPL EXCLUDES MEDITATION CAUSE MY MDITATION IS JUST A A RECOGNITION OF AN INTRINSIC CHARACTER OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN EACH MOMENT AND ALL YOU HAVE IN EACH MOMENT IT'S CONSCIOUSNESCE AND IT'S CONTENTS WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING SO A SO IN THE BEGINNING YOU YOU KNOW YOU YOU'LL BE VERY DELIBERATE AND PRECIOUS ABOUT DECIDING TO PRACTICSE MEDITATION YOU'LL SET ASIDE TEN MINUTES IN THE MORNING AND YOU'LL DO THAT AND THEN AND IT'LL SEEM VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE NEXT TEN MINUTES WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW SPILLING OUT ON TO YOUR TO TO DULIST AND YOUR YOUR TRANFIGURE OUT WHAT THE DAY LOOKS LIKE RIGHT BUT ULTIMATELY YOU WANT TO ERASE THIS BOUNDARY BETWEEN FORMAL PRACTICE IN THE REST OF LIFE SUCH THAT THERE'S IT IT'S JUST NOT REMOTELY FINDABLE AND AND IM AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S ACHIEVABLE AND  I THINK YFROM THE VERY BEGINNING YOU CAN RELAX THIS CONCEPTIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN MEDITATION AND ITS ANTITHESIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AT THE LEVEL OF ANYTHING YOU'RE DOING IT'S THE LEVEL IT'S AT THE LEVEL OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THOUGHT YOU KNW I LIKE WHAT WHAT CAN YOU KNOTISE WHEN WHEN YOU NOTE IT'S THE TRANSITION FROM ANL THE BY THE BY STABLE PERCEPT IND OR YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE AT THE AM THE IMAGE AND YOU SEE NOTHING YOU'LL SAY THIS  OF THE DALMATION YOU KNOWIT'S JUST THE SPOTS ON THE PAPER AND YOU JUST YOU DON'T SEE YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE DALMATION OR THE FACE OF JESUS OR WHATEVER THE IMAGES POPS OUT AND THEN YOU SEE IT IT'S THE TRANSITION FROM NOTHING TO SOMETHING RIGHT THAT YOU THE PRACTICE BECOMES THE TRANSITION FROM BEING LOST IN THOUGHT AND THEND WAKING UP AND BRIT YOU VERY MUCH LIKE WBREAKING THE SPELL OF THOUGHT IDENTIFICATION WITH THOUGHT IS VERY MUCH LIKE WAKING UP FROM A DREAM AND HAVINGD IT'S LIKE THAT THAT TRANSITION THE THE WHOLE LIKE YOUE HAVING A DREAM AND THITS COUPLE THINGS ARE TRUE THERE MD IT IT REALLY IS A KIND OF IT'S IT'S A IT'S A PSYCHOSIS THAT IS JUST NOT WE DON'T PROBLEMATIZE BECAUSE YOU'RE SAFELY IN BED AND YOU'RE NOT MOVING O UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SOME KIND OF IN TA SLEEP  DISORDER YOU'RE NOT WALKING AROUND HARMING YOURSELF OR ANYBODY ELSE SO BUT TO BE IN BED AND TO NOT KNOW IT AND TO THINK YOU'RE YOU KNOW RUNNING ALONG A BEACH OR YOU KNOW YOU'R N TAT YOU KNOW GETTING TRIED FOR MURDER AND A COURT OF LAW OR WHATEVER THE THING IS THAT YOU'RE COMPLETELY DELUSIONAL ABOUT RIGHT THAT IS PSYCHOSIS RIGHT AND ANS IT LIKE YOU'RE FUNDAMENTALLY UNAWARE OF YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN YOU THE TWO THINGS CAN HAPPEN THERE YOU CAN EITHER BE COME LUSED WITHIN THE DREAM RIGHT WHICH IS INTERESTING IN THIS WHOLE AS A WHOLE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THAT WHICH 'M CAN BE PRACTISED BUT MORE COMMONLY YOU CAN JUST WAKE UP FROM THE DREAM AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PROBLEM YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD IS NO LONGER THERE AND A AND YU HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONTEXT FOR YOUR CONSCIOUS LIFETLY NOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN BAT YOUARE SAFELY IN BED ALL ALL THE WHILE THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING ANALOGIUS WHEN YOU BREAK THIS IDENTIFICATION WITH THOUGHT RAT YOU'RE JUST YOURE HAVING A THOUGHT THAT SEEMS TO BE SOME KIND OF YOU YOUO I MORAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL EMERGENCY AND AND YET YOU CAN YOU CAN THE MOMENT YOU SEE DAYLIGHT AROUND IT THE MOMENT YOU SEE THAT THAT THE MIND IS LARGER THAN YTHEN THAT THIS MERE APPEARANCE RIGHT THEN YOU HAVE IT' SUDDENLY HAVE A DEGREE OF FREEDOM THAT THAT A MOMENT AGO WAS JUST UNTHINKABLE RIGHT AND YOU'RE ALSO YOU RECOGNIZE YOU SURCOME TO IN A WAY YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE IN A WAY THAT YOU WEREN'T A MOMENT AGO WHEN YOU WERE JUST TALKING TOYOURSELF WHEN YOU WARE JUST IDENTICAL TO THAT  CONVERSATION I SO THIS ALL ALL TO SAY THAT THAT ULTIMATELY MEDITATION IMIT'S  AGAIN THERE'S ANOTHER APPARENT PARADOX HERE MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MEDITATION WILL SAY THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WELL YOU KNOW FOR ME RUNNING IS MY MEDITATION OR SCHEME OR ROCK CLIMBING OR PLAIN THE GUITAR WOS SOMETHING THEY LIKE TO DO THAT GIVES THEM AN EXPERIENCE A FLOW THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THEY GO TO TO FEEL BETTER AND THAT THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF ALL THAT IN THE CHAOS OF THEIR LIVES OR THE THASN'T YOU KNOW THEIR TIME ON TWITTER WHATEVER IT IS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY CASE IT'S IT'S NOT TRUE TO SAY THAT THAT IS EFFECTIVELY MEDITATIO YOU'RE NOT KIN  BY LEARNING TO PLAY THE GUITAR YOU'RE NOT ING TO LEARN WHAT I'M CALLING MEDITATION AND YOU'RE NOT IN A LEARN IT BY YOU KNOW PSYCHLANE OR GETTIGIN GETTING  NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU GET AT ANY OF THOSE THINGS YOU'RE NOT ING TO LEARN IT BY DOING THOSE THINGS BUT PARADOXICALLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT REALLY BUT IT CAN SEEM LIKE A PARADOX ONCE YOU KNOW HOW TO MEDITATE THEN YOU CAN MEDITATE DOING ALL O THOSE THINGS RIGHT MEDITATION'S TOTALLY COMPATIBLE WITH PLAYING THE GUITAR SCHEME OR YOUR DOING ANY ORDINARY THING YOU LIKE TO DO RIGHT SO ONCE YOU KNOW HOW TO MEDITATE AND AGAIN IT'S TOTALLY NATURAL IN THE BEGINNING TO FORMALEYES THAT AND TO SET ASIDE TIME EACH DAY TO DO IT BECAUSE IT IS A IT IS A TRAINING AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE BEGINNING YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO BUT ONCE YOU HAVE ONCE YOU'RE GETTING USED TO IT THEN THERE IS NO GOOD REASON NOT TO BE EXPERIENCING THIS THING I'M CALLING MEDITATION THIS THI INSIGHT YOUNTO THAT THE THE CENTRELESSNESS OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE THE NON SELF WOUD OF CONSCIOUSNESS IM YOU SHOULD EXPERIENCE IT WHEN YOU ARE PLAIN YOUR FAVORITE SPORT OR WHEN YOUR YOU HAVEN A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY AND THE THEN THE REAS THEN TO COME BACK TO YOUR INITIAL ASSUMPTION ABOUT EYES CLOSED A LOT OF PRACTICE IT EVEN FORMAL PRACTICE CAN BE DONE EYES OPEN AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO IT EYES OPEN BECAUSE SO MUCH OF OUR ANCERING OF OUR SENSE OF SELF IS IS BASE ON VISUAL CUSE  ME WITAUI JUST WE WE KNOW THAT YOUGIVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT VISUAL CUSE YOU CAN TRANS LOCATE THEIR SENSE OF SELF YOU CN GIVE THEM AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE NYOU WITH A T WITH A VIDIO DISPLAY WHERE Y CAN LITERALLY MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE YOU GO THERE'S A BODY SWAPPING ILLUSION YOU CAN MAKE THEM U CAN MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THERE IN ANOTHER PERSON'S BODY LOOKING BACK AT THEIR BODY IF YOU IF YOU YOU RUN THE CAMERAS THE RIGHT WAY I'VE DONE THISIN AR SEEING IN TO MIDSHIP OF YOU THEY CREATE AN AVATAR FOR YOU AND THEN YOUR RODILY MOVEMENTS GENERATE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE AVATAR AND UM YOU START GAINING PRESENCE AS THEY CALL IT IN YR LINGO VERY QUICKLY AND THEN PRETTY SOON UM YOU LOSE SENSE OF YOUR OWN BODILY REPRESENTATION AND YOU AND UM IT'S A LITTLE EARY OF WHAT'S URIOUS TO ME IS UN GOING BACK INTO T YOUOF COURSE NEVER LEFT BUT UM BACK INTO YOUR ACTUAL BODY WHEN THE ARGOGGLES POP OFF THE WORLD SEEMS ALMOST OVERWHELMING THE NUMBER OF SENSURY STIMULE VENTERING  LIKE A LABORATORY ROOM WHICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE SPARSE UM SO EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBE THIS TRANSELOCATION OF OF NOTIONS OF SELF THROUGH YEUSUAL EXPERIENCE  BUT CONVERSELY WHEN YOU LOSE THE SENSE OF SELF WIT THE THE SENSE SELF OM TALKING ABOUT IT CAN BE ESPECIALLY VIVID AND INSALIENT WITH EYES OPEN BECAUSE BECAUSE SO MUCH SO MANY OF YOUR REFERENCE POINTS TO SELF WOULD ARE DELIVERED VISUALLY RIGHT ESPECIALLY INTA SOCIAL SITUATIONS LIKE AN I'M TALKING TO YOU YOU'RE LOOKING BACK AT ME RIGHESLY YOU'RE THE IMPLICATION OF YOUR GAZE IS THAT I'M OVER HERE BEHIND MY FACE IMPLICATED BY YOUR GAZS LIKE THIS OF THE SENSE THAT YOURE LOOKING AT SOMETHING IS THE SENSE OF SELF IN THAT SOCIAL CONTACTS RIGHT AND SO ND IF YOURE IF YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSION CHANGES LIKE SI'ME SAYING SOMETHING AND IF YOU CONFURROW YOUR BROW LIKE WHAT'S A HEALS IT YOU AND I CAN READ INTO THAT FACIUAL CHANGE SOME INNER STATE OF YOURS THAT IS BEING OF SAILING IN TO ME ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'VE GOT THIS SORT OF DANCE OF LIKE I'M NOTICING YOU REACTING TO ME AND IM F THAT'S THAT'S CHANGING THE WAY I'M FEELING ABOUT WHAT I'M THAT HAT THAT'S THAT'S THE G OF THE THE PURVIEW OF EVERY NAUROSIS EVERYONE DIDN'T WANT RIGHT AND EVERY RELATIONSHIP I AD A GORFROM WHENAS A POSTAT WHOIS IT WHO IS UM VERY VERY A SHE'S BRILLIANT REALLY UM STILL AS AND SHEOW SAID THAT EVERY RELATIONSHIP THE RUFERENT IS IS THEIR FOUR ARROWS SIMEROSLY SSTILL ES AND SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S THE ARROW OF YOU KNOW A THAT SHOUS TALKING TO ME SO SHE SAID YOU ME TO YOU AND CONE OF WHAT YOU PRECEED COMING FOR ME AND THEN TERE'S YOU TO ME AND THEN THERE'S AN ARROW FROM THE MIDDLE GOING RIGHT BACK AT EACH ONE OF O WHICH IS OUR OWN PERCEPTION OF WHAT THE OTHER PERSON IS THINKING ABAT US AND ITS FEEDING BACK ON THE OTHER ARROW AND SHE GIVE ME THIS VERY UM CLEER BUT AM MODEL OF BASILY RELATIONSHIPS IN I THE RELATIONSHIP FAILED BUT IT WAS GOOD WHILE I LASTED I SHOULD SAY AND AM BUT THE FOUR AROW MODEL OF RELATIONSHIPS ACTUALLY SHOWS UP IN EVERY TYPE OF A ONE ONE OF ONE OF RELATIONSHIP AN IS PROBABLY IN UNDER DESCRIPTION OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ARROWS BUT AS I THINK IT'S EXACTLY WEE DESCRIME IS A PERCEPTION OF SELF THROUGH THE EYES OF OTHER WHETHER NOT WE'RE IN PATHLIC OR NOT STRONGLY SHAPES THE WAY THAT WE ACCESS DIFFERENT CONTEXT DEPENDENT RULE SETS ABOUT WHATVERGAN A SAYNONCISAND H VERY DYNAMIC  YE SO BUT T THE FREEDOM THAT I THINK WE WANT AND PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES EXPERIENCE THIS JUST HALP HAZARDLY BUT THAT THE THING THAT THE CENTER OF THE BULLS I FROM THE MEDITATIVE POINT OF VIEW IS TO GET OFF THAT RIDE ENTIRELY AND TO IS OS O THLOSING THE SENSE OF SELF IN THIS CONTEXT OF OF A A SOCIAL ENCOUNTER IS TO IS TO GIVE UP YOUR FACE ESSENTIALLY LIKE YOUARE LIKE SD AND WHAT WHAT THAT ENTAILS IS OR WHAT THAT GIVES YOU IS THE FREE ATTENTION TO ACTUALLY JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE OTHER PERSON AND THE OTHER PERSON IS NOW NO LONGER QUITE AN OBJECT IN THE WORLD FOR YOU THERE'S REALLY JUST A KIND OF TOTALITY OF WHICH THAT PERSON IS A PART I'M AND DIN THE ACTUALLY MUN O MARTIN BOOBER THE THE A ONMYSTICAL I JEWISH PHILOSOPHER I TALKED ABOUT THE KND OF THE I THOW RELATIONSHIP AND  THIS I THINK IT AT YOU KNOW IS BEEN LONG TIMES HEN I'VE READ BOOBER BUT  I DON'T KNOW IF HE GOES YOU FAR ENOUGH TO BE TRULY NON TULISTIC BUT THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN I I NOW I'M BECAUSE THE THE THAW PART OF IT IS IS I THINK POTENTIALLY THIS IR MAGAIN IT'S BEEN SEVERAL DEKIT SINCE I READ READ HIM BUT THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A WAY OF BEHOLDING ANOTHER PERSON WERE YOU HAVE THE FREE ATTENTION TO SIMPLY BEHOLD THEM RIGHT YOULIKE YOUARE NO LONGER YOUE URNAT YOU NO LONGER CARE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT YOU YOU DON'T FEEL NERONICALLY IMPLICATED BY THEIR GAZE YOU DON'T FEEL YOU YOUYOU'RE SIMPLY THE SPACE IN WHICH THEIAR APPEARINC RIGHT AND SO YOU'RE FREE YOU LIKE THERE'S JUST THERE'S NO AND AND PEOPLE CAN FEEL AND SO YOUR YOUR BY DEFINITION YOUARE NO LONGER SELF CONSCIOUS RIGHT AND WHEN WITH AND THIS PHRASE SELF CONSCIOUSNESS REALLY DOES GET AT THIS WHAT I'M CALLING THE SELF THAT THE ILLUCORYSELF AS A KIND OF CONTRACTION AND AND YOU CAN YOU CAN NOTICE THIS FOR YOURSELF JUST IMAGINE WHAT IS LIKE TO GO FROM NOT BEING SELF CONSCIOUS TO SUDDENLY BEING SELF CONSCIOUS AND THTHA  THE THE PROXIMA CAULS OF THIS YOU  U ALMOST INVARIABLY IS SUDDENLY RECOGNI IZING THE SOMEBODY'S LOOKING AT YOU RAT'S LIKE YOUR YOU'RE IN A STARBUX AND YOU'R YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALONE AND YOU'RE READ ING THE NEWSPAPER WHATEVERIT IS MIS THAT NOW SOUNDS HIGHLY ANACRINISTIC HASPEEND THREE YEARS SINCE I'VE HELD A PHYSICAL NEWSPAPER INOSTAR BUKS A BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND YOU LOOK UP AND YOU  JUST YOUR SEEING YOU KNOW A ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS BUT THEN YOU NOTICED THAT SOME ONE IS JUST LOOKING AT YOU YOU KNOW AND SO LIKE THAT MOMENT OF I CONTACT RIGHT SUDDENLY THAT THROWS YOU BACK ON YOURSELF AT'S A KIND OF SUDDENLY YOU'RE THE OBJECT IN IN THE WORLD FOR THAT OTHER PERSON THAT RECOGNITION IS A THE TIGHTENING THERE THE KI KIND OF CONTRACTION THERE IS A IS A A A FURTHER RAMIFICATION OF THIS THIS FEELING MOST OF US HAVE MOST OF THE TIME OF BEING THE CENTERE OF EXPERIENCE LIKE THE TIGHTAT AT THE PLACE YOU FEEL LIKE LIKE IT'S IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL WALKING AROUND WITH A FIST AND IN MOMENTS OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THE FISK ETS REALLY TIGHT YOU KNOW AND THAT AND THAT'S SOME THAT'S THE THING THAT GETS FULLY RELAXED WHEN YOU DISCOVER THIS THIS WHAT I'M YOU KNOW IT VARIOUS POINTS CALL THE NATURE OF MIND OR THATHE NONDUAL NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS JUST THAT THERE IS NO CENTERE TO THIS EXPERIENCE AND WHEN YOU RECOGNIZED NO CENTR THEN EVEN WHEN YOU'RE GAZE IS AIMED AT ANOTHER PERSON'S GAZE THERE IS NO IMPLICATION GOING BACK TO THE CENTER CAUSE TE IS NO CENTERE RIGHT AND AND RATHER THAN THAT BEING AN AN EXPERIENCE OF WEIRD DETACHMENT OR CONFUSION OR OR IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY AAN EXPERIENCE OF GREATER RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE YOU'RE NO LONGER YOUE NO LONGER DEFENDIT YOU'RE OIS OT  YOU'RE NOT DEFENDING ANYTHING OVER HERE LIKE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT BRACED AGAINST ANYTHING YOU'RE JUST THE SPACE IN WHICH THAT PERSON IS SHOWING UP AND SO IT'S IT IT'S IT IT'S OF AN EXPERIENCE OF BEING MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IN IN THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER PERSON WHEN YOU WHATEVER YOURE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT CONTRACTING RIGHT AND THEN WHEN YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT AGAIN AND THIS IS MEDITATION AND THIS MEDITATION THAT IS TOTALLY COMPATIBLE WITH HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY AND THEN WHEN YOU  NOTICE YOURSELF CONTRACTING LIKE WHEN YOU NOTICE YOU'RE NOT DOING YOU'RE NOT MEDITATING ANY MORE YOU'RE JUST YOU'RE CTUALLYE REACTING LIKE THEY JUST SAID SOMETHING OR LOOKED A CERTAIN WAY AND NOW YOU'R CASTBACK UPON YOURSELF IN RELATIONSHIP TO THEM THAT BECOMES A KIND OF MINDFULNESS ALARM RIGHT THEN YOU KNOW THAT THAT IT IT BECOMES LIKE THE THE THE UNSATISFACTORINESS OF THAT PSYCHOLOGICALLY BECOMES MORE AND MORE SALIENT RIGHT AND IT'S SOME BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ONE THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE IN THE SYCH IT THE ANTITHESIS OF BEING AS AS COMFORTABLE AS YOU WERE A MOMENT AGO BUT TO IT'S IT'S  SOMETHING YOU'RE DOING UN NECESSARILY RIGHT LIKE S LIKE YOUR YOUR  OR YOU'RE LIKE AGAIN YOU'RE MAKING A FIST WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A FIST RINAND IT'S IM AGAIN YOU CAN LEAVE ASIDE ALL THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IS APPROPRIATE TO REACT TO SOME ONE AND  I OU KNOW 'M INTO MARTIAL ARTS AND SELF DEFENSE AND YES YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE JUST THIS PUDDLE OF GOO OUT IN THE WORLD WHO CAN BE JUST MISTREATED BY PEOPLE AND AND YOU NEVER PUT UP YOU KNOW RESISTANCE BUT IT'S SOM PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT EVEN OF EVEN IF A STATE LIKE ANGER OR CONTRACTION IT'S SOMETIMES NORMITIVE AND APPROPRIATE THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG IS IT NORMITIVE AND APPROPRIATE FOR LIKE HOW HOW LONG DO YOU WANT TO STAY ANGRY FOR IM IN MY EXPERIENCE FEESING IS CONECLASTICALLY NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE ANGER AND FEAR ARE APPROPRIATE AS SALIENT CUSE IN THEY THEY ORIENT YOU TO IN UP AN EMERGENCY ARE A POTENTIAL EMERGENCY BUT THEN IN DEALING WITH THE EMERGENCY THEY'RE ALMOST NEVER THE STATE YOU WANT OF BEING YOU KNOWUS LIKELIT YOU DON'T YOUYOU  LIKE IT'S IT'S BETTER TO ACTUALLY BE CALM IN AN EMERGENCY OU KNOSO O ABSOLUTLY I THINK THAT UM AND AGAIN THE LANGUAGE IS IS IN SUFFICIENT TO DESCRIBE WAT UM WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US WHAT I THINK O WHAT COMES TO MIND FOR ME IS THI A DISTINCTION BETWEEN SITUATIONAL WARENESS AND SELF AWARENESS AND WE NEED BOTH BUT UNDER CONDITIONS OF E A EMERGENCY TRUE EMERGENCY UM OR MOTIVATED DESIRE WE NEED TO UM DIL DOWN THE AMOUNT OF SELF AWARENESS IN ORDER TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE SITUATIONOR RARENESS M BUT YOU SAID SOTHING VERY IMPORTANT IN MY LABS EN WORKING ON A FEAR LIKE STATES FOR A LONG TIME SIME GET CONFESS I'M GEN TO AN ROB THIS FROM YOU BUT ALL CREDIT YOU EVERY TIME I DESCRIBE IS THAT THAT THE THAT THE THE FEAR OF THE THREAT DETECTION STATE OR SET OF EVENTS A ACTS AS A AS A FLAG BUT IS NOT MEANT TO PERSIST IN THE WAY THAT O THE FLAG WENT UP IF ONE IS TO BE IN THEI'RE MOST ADAPTIVE STATE ATHALLY JOCKE WELLING AN I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS HE HAS IT TUSKLE OT ABOUT DETACHMENT AND OPEN GAZE THINGS AT MY LABINTERESTED VISIAL SYSTEM IN AUTONOMIC INTERACTION O WHITE BROADENING THE GAZE LITERALLY BROADEN IS THE TIME DOMAIN OF THINKING A YOU'VE COME UP WITH NEW A SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND REAL TIME AND SO ON AND UM AND YOU'RE DESCRIBING EVERY DAY SEID OF INTERACTIONS WHERE THAT CAN BE VERY USEFUL AND YET THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING  ABOUT THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE MEDITATION IN WHAT YOU'VE MANAGE TO ARRIVE AT AND ON WHAT PRACTITIONERS OF MEDITATION CAN ARRIVE AT WHICH IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT ELIGATE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BEING EFFECTIVE OR OPTIMIZING ALL THE LANGUAGE WE SEE THROWN AROUND A LOT IN THE SPACE THAT II LIVE IN THESE DAYS BUT UM BUT SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY MORE IMPORTANT ABOUT HOW TO EXPERIENCE LIFE AND THE SELF THIS THIS REALIZATION THAT WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS THERE WAS NEVER REALLY THERE THERE BUT THAT THEREARE CONSTRAINTS THAT LIMIT THAT AND SO TO TRY IN FRACTURE THOSE ISCONSTRAINTS ONE BY ONE WOULD YOU SAY THAT MEDITATION AS A PRACTICE DONE FOR A FEW MINUTES EACH DAY OR WITH THE AP THAT IT'S AY AM KCOND OF STEP FUNCTION IS A VERY NON LINEERING TERMS OF PEOPLE'S PROGRESS AM YOU KNOW IM CERTAINLY GOING TO GO AM START DOING MORE MEDITATION BASED ON THIS DISCUSSION TRULY AM BECAUSE ANY TIME SOME ONE DESCRIBES A AM THAT THERE'S BECONE OF A MIT THAT WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN I I BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF DISSOLVING THAT MATH THAT'S A VERY  SADOCTIVE VERY SO THANKYOU FOR USEING THAT ONE THERE IS NO BETTER MARKETING TOAL WHICH AS I REALIZED WHAT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DO HERE BUT THAT'S THOG ME TO CAPTURE MY MY A EFFORTS YOU TELL ME THAT THERE'S A MITH THAT I'M LIVING IN AND THAT IT CAN BE DISSOLVED THAND THAT OPENS UP A BETTER LANDSCAPE AM YOU WHAT IS THE THE PROCESS LIKE IS DO SOME PEOPLE MAKE PROGRESS VORY QUICKLY DO SOME PEOPLE A EXPERIENCE KIND OF STEP FUNCTIONS TOWARDS PROGRESS WHAT IS THE MEDITATION PRACTICE LOOK LIKE OVER TIME A DO YOU STILL MEDITATOR TO GIVE YOU JUST THREADED IT THROUGH YOUR DO GIT SU YOUR WRITING YOUR DAILY LIFE YOUR COFFEE YOUR TIME WITH YOUR WIFE ET CETERA YE ATWAS SO JUST TO COME BACK TO TO TO TALK BY THE MITH FOR A SECOND TO THE THERE REALLY WHAT YOU JUST ENUNCIATED WAS AA CON OF A SECOND DOORWAY INTO THIS WHOLE PROJECTS SO THEY THE THE USUAL DOORE IS THRUG THE DOOR OF SUFFERING FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD  PEOPLE FEEL UNHAPPY IN A VARIETY OF WAYS AND THEY GET MORE SENSITIVES TO THE MECHANICS OF THEIR OWN UNHAPPINESS AND MEDITATION BT IS ONE OF THE THINGS ON THE MENU THI SCENE THAT IS IS EXPLICITELY BUILL IS A REMEDY FOR FOR UNHAPPINESS AND I AND IT IS AND THAT'S UNECT I THINK I'S PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON PATH TO THIS BUT ANOTHER PATH IS JUST INTELLECTUAL INTEREST ME JUST WANTING TO KNOW WHAT'S REAL SU ABOUT THE MIND SUBJECTIVELY IN AN FIRST PERSON WHY AND AND THAT THERE'S THE'S NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS AMOUT A MOTIV ATED BY BOTH OF THEM BUT IM YET IT'STHE TOTALLY VALID DOORWAY INTO THIS IM THERE DEFINITELY STEP FUNCTIONS A MIT WOULD SAY THERE THERE AT LEAST TOO EMIN THE THE AND I REALLY REALLY ARTICULATED ALONG THE LINES OF OF AM THE FRAME WORK I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING OF OF DUALISTIC AND NONDUALISTIC MINDFULNESS OR I SAW IN THE BEGINNING YOU'RE GING TO START OUT YOU KNO NINDYNG INE POINT NINE PRERCENT PEOPLE START OUT DUALISTICALLY PAYIN ATTENTION AND AND NOTICING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING DISTRACTED BY THOUGHT AND THEN BEING ON THE OBJECT OF ATTENTION WHETHERE IS THE BREATH OR SOUNDS OR WHATEVER AND EVENTUALY THAT YOU KNOW THAT OPENS UP TO ALL POSSIBLE OBJECTS OF ATTENTION INCLUDING THOUGHTS AND IND THAT THERE'S STILL THIS FLUCTUATION BETWEEN BEING DISTRACTED AND THEN BEING A MINDFUL OF WHA TEVER AND THE FACT THAT IT'S OPEN TO ALL POSSIBLE OBJECTS DIFFERENTIATES THIS TYPE OF PRACTICE FROM ANYTHING THAT IS NARROWLY FOCUSED ON ONE OBJECT LIKE A MONTRA OR A VISUALIZATION OR SU SIHT YOU KNOWS THOSE ARE OTHER PAS OF PRACTICE THAT ARE MORE CONCENTRATION BASED I AND INTERESTING BUT THE THE BENEFIT OF MINDFULNESS IS THAT VERY QUICKLY YOU REALIZE IS BY DEFINITION COMPATIBLE WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ARTIFICIALLY CONTRACTING YOUR ATTENTION DOWN TO SOMETHING YOUARE T YOU'RE JUST BEING AWARE OF THE NEXT THING A SIGHT A SOUND A TASTE A THOUGHT I SO THE FIRST STEP FUNCTION IS TO VERY CLEARLY EXPERIENCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING LOST AND THOUGHT AND BEING CLEARLY AWARE OF ANY PART OF EXPERIENCE INCLUDING THOUGHT AND TO NOTICE THE FREEDOM THE COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL FREEDOM THAT GIVES YOU R I SAY YOU CAN LIKE YOUR SOMETHING'S MADE YOU ANGRY AND NOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ALL REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD BE ANGRY AND HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE ANGR AND WHAT YOURE OING TO TELL THAT PERSON WHEN YOU SEE THEM AND AND THEN YOU NOTICE YOU'RE THINKING RIHT AND YOU NOTICE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE THOUGHT AND THE ANGER RIGHT YOU LIKE IT LIKE  THE MINUTE SPENT LOST IN THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT'S MAKING YOU ANGRY IS THE THING THE DRAG THROUGH THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ANGER RIGHT AND THE MOMENT YOU NOTICED THAT ONCE YOUR MINDFUL ONCE YOU CAN BE MINDFUL YOU CAN NOTICE THOUGHT AS THOUGHT AND HOW QUICKLY THAT DISSIPATES THAT ST THE LANGUAGE AND THE IMAGRY JUST YOU YOU COULDN'T HOLD ON TO IT IF YOU WANTED TO AND THEN YOU NOTICE THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE ANGER IS JUST THIS YOU CON A MEANINGLESSE A YOU KNOW CONINER INCANDESCENCE THAT HAS ITS OWN HALF LIFE AND DEGRADES VERY VERY QUICKLY WHEN YOU'RE NO LONGER THINKING ABOUT THE REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD BE ANGRY YOU CAN'T HOLD ON TO THE ANGER THE ANGER ITSELF DISSIPATES RIGHT AND FROM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE ONE WHO'S BEING MINDFUL THIS IS TREMENDOUS RELIEF O AND ATMINIMOM IT'S A DEGREE OF FREEDOM YOU CAN AT THAT POINT DECINE WELL HOW LONG DO I WANT TO BE ANGRY FOR RIGHT IS A USEFUL TO STAY ANGRY TO ONE TO BE ANGRY FOR ONE MINUTE TWO MINUTES FIVE MINUTES TEN MINUTES OR CAUSE BEEN BEFORE YOU HAVE THAT CAPACITY TO BE MINDFUL YOU ARE OING TO HELPLESSLY BE AS ANGRY AS YOU'REGONG TO BE FOR AS LONG AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE THAT WAY JUST BASED ON THE KIND OF THE TIME COURSE OF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AT BROODING ABOUT IT TELLING YOUR WIFE ABOUT IT YOU DON'T LIKELY JUST THE THE O NO IT'S JUST GOING TO BE THIS CONVERSATION BASED MISADVENTURE IN YOU KNOW NEGATIVE A STATES OF MIND A AND YOU ARE YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE HOSTAGE OF THAT FOR AS LONG AS YOUWILL BE THE HOSTAGE OF THAT YOUL HAVE NOTHING YOU CAN DO APART FROM JUST DECIDING TO YOU KNOW CHECK OUT AND WATCH GAME OF THRONES AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME RIGHT LIKE IT LIKE IT'S JUST YOU CAN DIVERT URE ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS OUGHT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES OF GOOD THING TO DO BUT MINDFULNESS EVEN DUALISTIC MINDFULNESS GIVES YOU THIS CAPACITY TO JUST OBSERVE THE MECHANICS OF THIS AND THEN GET OFF THE RIDE WHEN YUWHEN YOU WHENEVER YOU WANT SO THAT REALLY IS A STEP FUNCTION LIKE FIRST THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE TIME BEFORE YOU COULD DO THAT AND THE THIS A TIME AFTER WHICH YOU CAN DO THAT THE OTHER STEP FUNCTION IS NOTICING THAT THERE IS NO ONE WHO IS DOING THAT AN THIS I THE NONDUALITY THAT THE SELFLESSNESS THE THE CENTRELESSNESS OF AWARENESS OR AT THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO PLACE FROM WHICH THE MINDFULNESS IS BEING AIMED BUT THE FACT THAT IT IS JUST THIS OPEN CONDITION IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS APPEARING BE O THOUGHT'S INCLUDED TO TO HAVE YOU AS AT THAT POINT YOURE MINDFULNESS NO LONGER BECOMES IT'S NO LONGER THIS THIS DUALIST IC EFFORT TO  STRATEGICALLY PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING AS OPPOSED TO BEING LOST IN THOUGHT IT'S JUST WHAT'S LEFT WHEN THOUGHTS WHENT WHEN WHEN THE PRESENT RECOGNIZED THOUGHT UNRAVELS EVEN BEFORE IT UNRAVELS WHAT'S RECOGNIZE IS YOU ARE SIMPLY ADENTICAL TO THE CONDITION IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS APPEARING AGAIN THIS IS NOT A I'M NOT MAKING A A A DEPOCTROCHOKRA LIKE METAPHYSICAL CLAIM ABOUT THE MIND YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT I MO SAY THE MIND ISN' WHAT THE BRAIN IS DOING I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE RECOGNIZING THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE UNIVERSE AND  NOT NOT MAKIN ANY BROAD CLAIMS ABOUT METAPHYSICS I'M JUST TALKING BAT AS A MATTER OF EXPERIENCE THERE IS JUST THIS CONDITION IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS APPEARING RIGHT AND WHAT YOU'RE CALLING YOUR BODY AGAIN AS A MATTER OF EXPERIENCE I NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN'T HAVE THIRD PERSON CONVERSATIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW PHYSICAL BODIES IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD BUT AS A MATTER OF EXPERIENCE THE ONLY BODY YOUARE EVER GOING TO DIRECTLY ENCOUNTER AS YOUR OWN IS IN APPEARANCE IN CONSCIOUSNESS RI SO CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT IN YOUR BODY WHAT YOU'RE CALLING YOUR BODY IS IN CONSCIOUSNESS YOU VISUALLY PROPRIATE STEPTIVELY IS LIE EVERYTHING IS JUST APPEARING IN THIS CONDITION AND AGAIN YOU ARE NOT AIMING THAT YOUARE NOT THIS IS NOT A SPOTLIKE THAT YOU'RE AIMING AT THE BODY OR AT YOU NOTHERE'S JUST THIS CONDITION IN WHICH EVERYTHING INCLUDING ANYTHING YOU COULD CALL YOURSELF IS APPEARING AND IM SO YET SO THAT'S THE SECOND STEP FUNCTION IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS ALIS IS ALREADY TRUE CONSCIOUNESS ALREADY WITHOUT THIS THING YOU'VE BEEN CALLING YOUR EGO E HOPING IN YOU HOPING TO TO UNRAVEL IT THROUGH MEDITATION CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT GOINGTO GET ANY MORE SELFLESS ANY MORE CENTRALESS ANY FREER THAN IT ALL ALWAYS ALREADY IS RECOGNIZE AS SUCH AND S OF THAT'S THAT'S THE TA THAT THE STEP FUNCTION AT THAT POINT IS YOUR MINDFULNESS OF THAT POINT THE THING YOU COME BACK TO WHEN YOU'RE NO LONGER DISTRACTED IS THAT THAT RECOGNITION AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THEN IT BECOME YET IT BECOMES COMPATIBLE WITH ANYTHING YOU WOULD DO AND SO TOY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES I I STILL PRACTICE YOU KNOW FORMALLY YOU KNOVE SOMETIMES YOU'RE FOROU FREQUENTLY BUT NOT YOU KNOW I I DEFINITELY MISDAYS AND I DON'T DO IT FOR I MAN I YOU KNO II DON'T RULE OUT THAT HAT POSSIBILIT I WONT GO BACK ON RETREAT AT VERYOUS TIMES JUST O YOU CHECKING WITH AT AND SEE IF THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUT I'M YOU KNOW I TELL YOU KNW I TEND TO SIT FOR I'M I M INTENDED I 'VE DESIGNED MY LIFE SO THAT I CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME MEDITATING WITHOUT HAVING TO BE FORMELLY MEDITATING LIKE SO YONG YOU KNOW I'LL GO FOR HIKE FOR TWO HOURS RIGHT AND WHEN I'M DOING WHEN I'M HIKING IS I IDENTICAL TO WHAT I'M DOING WHEN I'M QUOTE MEDITATING UNICITING IN A CHAIR YOU KNOVE DOING NOTHING BUT MEDITATE I'M SO IT'S I'M YET I MAY I JUST I GETTING THE I'M VERY I'M IM VERY INTERESTED IN A RACING THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN BWHAT PEOPLE ARE CALLING MEDITATION AND AND THE REST OF LIFE AND THAT SO THAT IN IN IN TEACHING THESE THINGS I TEND TO EMPHASIZE THAT FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE I I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY EASY TO SET UP I'M I'S  TO GET TO GET GULLD BY A BUNCH OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT THAT CAUSE YOU TO BE VERY IM SPLIT IN YOUR SENSE OF WHAT YOUR LIFE IS ABOUT AND LIKE O'M  SORT OF BANKING MY MEDITATION OVER HERE BECAUSE I'M IM O MEDITAING TWO HOURS A DAY DILIGENTLY AND YOU KNOWTITHIN CAN BE REALLY GOOD FOR ME AND THEN OVER HERE IS THE REST OF MY LIFE WHICH IS NOT NEARLY IS WISE OR IS USEFUL OR IS LIKE THIS IS THE STUFF THAT IS STILL THE AREA OF MY PROBLEMS AND I'M I THING IT'S USEFUL TO RECOGNIZE YOU'VE GOT ONE YOUVE GO ONE LIFE YOU KNOW AND YOU'VE GOT THIS THIS IT THIS SINGLE CONDITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS CONTENTS IN EVERY MODE OF LIFE AND THERE'S SOMETHING TO RECOGNIZE ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE ALWAYS FREE TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOUE TRULY EVEN IN YOUR DREAMS RIGHT I MINSTREST NOT THIS IT NEVER STOPS SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I TEND TO EMPHASIZE SO EARLIER YOU TOLD US THAT MEDITATION IS NOT ABOUT CHANGING THE CONTENT OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE AND IN A DIFFERENT PODCAST THAT YOU WERE ON HEARD YOU SAY SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF THAT NORMALLY WE ARE IN OUR DAILY EXPERIENCE AND UNLESS WE ARE TRAINED IN MEDITATION UNLESS WE DISSOLVED THIS ILLUSION OF THE GAP BETWEEN A ACTOR AN SELF AN OBSERVER THAT WE REQUIRE CERTAIN SENSORY EVENTS TO CREATE COLLISIONS WITHIN US AND WITH THE NATURAL WORLD THAT SORT OF YOU KNO BLAST US INTO A DIFFERENT MODE OF BEING I WANTING YOUSE THAT AS A WAY TO FRAME UP THIS IDEA THAT SOME THINGS SUCH AS PSYCHEDELICS BUT ALSO A VERY LONG HIKE A VERY LONG FAST AM YOU W KNOWS A BANQUET I YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIFE EXPERIENCES DO EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOUR DESCRIBING MEDITATION DOES WHICH IS THAT THEY ACTIVELY CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF OUR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE SO MUCH SO THAT WE OFTEN REMEMBER THOSE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES YOURE COULD YOU TELL US WHY PSYCHODELICS KAN BE USEFUL AND HERE I GIVE THE COVIOTS THAT MAY BE FEEL AM OBLIGATE TO GIVE AS WELL BUT THIS WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU SAFELY IN RESPONSIBLY AGE APPROPRIATE CONTLICTS APPROPRIATE I DEALY WITH SOME A CLINICAL OR OTHER TYPE OF GUIDANCE THE GALITY ISSUES OBEYED ET CETERA ALL THAT STATED YOU PSYCHODELICS TO ME ARE IN EXPERIENCE OF A ALTERED PERCEPTION INTERNAL AN EXTERNAL PERCEPTION ALTERED SPACETIME RELATIONSHIP SOMEWHAT DREAM LIKE A THING T WAS ALAN HOBSON AT HARVARD FOR LONG TIME TIME ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PSYCHODELIC LIKE STATES IN DREAM LIKE STATES A BECAUSE OF THIS DISTORTION OF SPACETIME DIMENTIONALITY AM AND I HAVEND I EXPERIMENTED WITH THEM MUCH AM I'VE BEEN PART OF A CLENICAL TRIAL THREE DOSES OF M D M A WHICH CERTAINLY ALTERED MY THE THE QUALITY OF MY CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE AND WAYS THAT LED TO A LOT OF LASTING AND T E LEAST FOR ME VALUABLE LEARNING YER SO WHAT YOU WHATEVER YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT PSYCHODELICS AN TERMS OF HOW THEY INTERSECT WITH THE DESCUSSION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING AND AM WHAT YOUTILITY DO THEY PLAY AND O RECOGNITION OF THE SELF OR IN OTHER SORTS OF BRAIN CHANGES WEL SOI YE CALOS AS PRICE IN ALL THOSE CABIOTS THAT PEOPLE CAN ANTICIPATE IM THESE DRUGS ARE NOT WITHOUT THEIR RISKS AND IT'S IT'S ONE PROBISE THAT WE HAVE THIS PSINGLE TERM DRUGS ARE  PSYCHODELICS WHICH NAMES MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUBSTANCES ANDTHEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME AND THY'RE O I SO LIKE EMPDY AMAY I'S NOT EVEN TECHNICALLY A PSYCHODELIC I THINK HAS IMMENT'S THERAPUTIC VALUE AND IT ACTUALLY WAS MY GATEWAY DRUG TO THIS THIS WHOLE AR IF CONCERN I FEDOMING PATHAGE AND RIGHT IT'S AS SERF AN INPEDOMIN AND A PATHAGEYEI Y IT IT'S OFTEN CAL PATHAGE YEAN PAF  ENGAN NOT PATHAGE A M PATHAGE AND NAN I PATHAGENER AN ENTACTOGIN IT'S IT'S BEEN CALLED IM BUT IT DOESN'T TEND TO CHANGE PERCEPTION IN THE WAY THAT CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS DO AND IT'S IT'S IT'S ALSO SARETON URGIC BUT IT'S IT'S NOT IM IT HAS TO BE IN IIN SOME PART DIFFERENTLY SO THAN M EVEN ELISTIN AND SYLISIP AND WHICH ARE MUCH MORE SIMILAR AND CAN CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS BOTH ARE ALSO CERTAN ERGIC BUT THEY'RE NOT MERELY SO AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALSO DIFFERENT AND AND THE HIER DOSE YOU TAKE OF THESE DRUGS THE MORE YOUEA AT LOWER DOSEAS EVERYTHING CAN ISEEM THE SAME AT HIRDOSEAS THEY HE THE THEY BEGIN TO DIVERGE IM A WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE THE A FARM A COLOGY IF YOU WANTED TO BUT IM THE I I WOULD JUST SAY THAT FOM MANY OF US E CERTAINLY FROM ME PSYCHADELICS WERE INDISPENSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING IMPROVING TO ME THAT THIS WAS THA THAT TA FIRST PERSON INTERROGATION OF THE MIND WAS WORTH DOING YOU KNOW TU I WAS SOMEBODY WHO AT YOU AG SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN BEFORE I HAD ANY REAL EXPERIENCE WITH IM WITH EMPTY AMAY OR ELISTE OR SYLICIBAN IM IF YOU HAD TAUGHT ME HOW TO MEDITATE AT THAT POINT I THINK I WOULD HAVE JUST BOUNCED OFF THE WHOLE PROJECT I THINK MY MIND WAS I I WAS JUST I WAS SO IM SEREBRAL IN MY JUST MI ENGAGEMENT WITH ANYTHING I WAS SO SCEPTICAL OF ANY OF THE THE SPIRITUAL TO HET RELIGIOUS IN SPIRITUAL TRADITIONS THAT THAT HAVE GIVEN US MOST OF OUR MEDITATION TALK YOU KNOW IM THAT I THINK I JUST WOULD HAVE I EN I KNOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE LIKE INO I HAVE I HAVE TRIED TO TEACH ING A RICHAR DOK ANDS TO MEDITATE AND DANIEL DEN AT TO MEDITAVE AVE AMBUSHED THEM WITH MEDITATION AND BING A BOTHY BOTHING I GROUP SET IN AND AND ONE ON ONE INOT NOT DAN BUT A BUT RICHARD I I I AMBUSHED ON MY OWN POTGAST WITH A GUIDED MEDITATION AN HE JUST YOU KNOW FROM HIS HEAP U NO HE CLOSES HIS EYES HE LOOKS INSIDE AND THERE'S NOTHING OF INTEREST TO SEE IHT LIKE IS JUST IT'S LIKE THIS NOT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE THE IM THE CONCEPTIUAL INTEREST IN HIM THAT WOULD HIT WOULD CAUSE HIM TO TO PERSIST LONG ENOUGH TO FIND OUT THAT THERE'S A THERE THERE RIGHT NOW THIS IST NOT A PROBLEM WITH ELISTY OR SYLICIDE BUNDER EMDYA MAY AM I KNOW THAT IF I GAVE HIM A HUNDRED MICROGRAMS OF ELISTY OR FIVE GRAMS OF OF MUSHROOMS OR YOUR TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE MELEGRAMS OF SYLICIAN IM THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE ANALOGOUS DOSAGE TO THE FIVEGRAMS OF MUSHROOMS FIVEGRAMS OF MUSHROOMS WOULD BE MORE THAN THAT I I I I FORGET WHAT IT IS OF AAF EMPDYA MA MAY BE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MELEGRAMS I THINK THE MAPSIDUS IS  A WHICH IS THE ONE THAT S UNDER CLIN OF CHARLES AS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILIOGRAMS WITH THE OPTION OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILIRAM RESTR I RI WENTY II REMYES HRNTHE FACTS THAT COME TO TO HAND A IM BUT ATHI'S NOT THERE'S JUST NO POSSIBILITY THAT NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW SOMETHING WITH WITH A PSYCHODELIC WWITH WITH EMTY AMA MOST PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE  CERTAINLY UNDER ANY KIND OF GUIDANCE TON HAVE A VERY A POSITIVE IN A PRO SOCIAL EXPERIENCE IM BUT YOU KNOW WITH A PSYCHODELIC YOU MIGHT HAVE A A  IM I A SOMEWHAT OU TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE IF YOU HAVE QUOTE A BAD TRIP YOU KNW F YOU AND I'VE CERTAINLY HAD THOSE EXPERIENCES ON ON ELISTY AND AND TO SOME EGRAN SILISIDMENT BUT I THE PROSPECT THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPENED IS JUST YOU YOU YOU KNOW A MILLION AN NEARLION MILLION CASES OUT OF A MILLION JUST NOT IN THE CARDS IN ME JUST JUST NEAR PHYSIOLOGICALLY SOMETHINGS GONG TO HAPPEN WITH THE REQUISITE DOSE OF OF A ONE OF THESE DRUGS AND IF IF THAT THING THAT HAPPENS IS IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY AT ALL NORMITIVE AND YOU KNOW PLEASANT AND INTERESTING AND VALUABLE WHICH IT IS SO MUCH OF THE TIME AND CERTAINLY UNDER THE APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW SET IN SETTING AND AND GUIDANCE I IT CAN BE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE TIME FOR YOU KNOWVERSUALLY EVERYBODY AGAIN THEIR CAVIODS IF YOU  YOU'R PRONE IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE YOU KNOW A PROCLIVITY FOR SKIS OFRIENDIA OR YOU KNOW BIPOLE OR DISORDER THIS IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT FOR YOU YOU KNOW AND ANYONE DOING I THE THE THE STUDIES IT LIKE JOHN'S HOPKINS FOR FOR IM THE THERAPUTIC EFFECTS OF OF ANY OF THESE DRUGS THERE THERE RULING OUT PEOPLE WITH YOU KNOW FIRST AGREE RELATIVES WITH WITH ANY OF THESE CLINICAL CONDITIONST IM BUT SO FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME AT EIGHTEEN WHO DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS AN AREA OF OF NOT ONLY INTEREST BUT WOULD BE  YOU KNOW THE THE CENTER OF GRAVITY TO THE REST OF HIS LIFE IF ONLY HE COULD PAY ATTENTION CLEARLY ENOUGH TO SEE THAT IT COULD BE RIGHT IM I WAS SOME ONE WHO VERY LIKELY AGAIN I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE COUNTERFACTUAL IN HAND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF IF SOME ONE HAD YOU KNOW FORCED ME TO MEDITATE FOR AN HOUR AT THAT POINT BUT I KNOW I WASN'T INTERESTED IN IT UNTIL I TOOK EMPTY A MA IM I KNOW I WASN'T HAVING THESE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES SPONTANEOUSLY THAT GET THAT SHOWED ME THAT THERE WAS AN INNER LANDSCAPE THAT WAS WORTH EXPLORING IM I WAS A VERY HARD HEADED SKEPTIC WHO WAS VERY INTERESTED IN LOTS OF THINGS BUT THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE TO ME JUST THINKING MORE ABOUT THOSE THINGS RIGHT I MA THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME OTHER WAY OF GRASP BEING COGNATIVELY AT THE INTERESTING PARTS OF THE WORLD BEYOND THINKING ABOUT THE WORLD RIGHT I JUST LIKE THAT JUST WOULDN'T HAVE COMPUTED FOR ME AT ALL RIGHT AND IF YOU HAD SO I JUSTAND ID LITTEALLY D NO ONE EVER GAVE ME A BOOK TO READ OR A NET HAVE HADI DON'T IF YOU THE NOUN MEDITATION VERY LIKELY MEANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ME BEFORE BEFORE I I TOOK MY FIRST DOSE OF  THATITHIS CASE WAS EMPTY O MA IM SO WHAT THE DRUG EXPERIENCE DID FOR ME IS IT JUST PROVED YU MAKE THI THAT THE LIMP ONE OF LIMITATIONS OF A DRUG IS THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY NOU MATTER HOW GOOD THE EXPERIENCE THE DRUG WEARS OFF AND THEN YOU'RE BACK TO IMMORAL IN MORLESS YOUR USUAL FORM AND NOW YOU HAVE A MEMORY OF THE EXPERIENCE AND IT CAN BE A FAIRLY DIM MEMORY MEN SOME OF THESE EXPERIENCES ARE SO DISCONTINUOUS WITH NORMAL WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT CAN' BE LIKE TRYING TO REMEMBER A DREAM YOU KNOW THAT JUST DISAPPEAR TDEGRADES YOU KNOW OF THE COURSE OF SECONDS AND THEN IT COULDHAVE BEEN N  THE MOST INTENSE DREAM YOU'VE EVER HAD AND FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU CAN BARELY GET A PURCHASE ON YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT AND I'M YOU KNW THERE'S SOME PSYCHODELICA PERIENCES THAT ARE NOW TIS TO THAT BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE MOST OF THE TIME THERE'S A RESORDUE OF THIS EXPERIENCE AND WITH SOMETHING LIKE EMPTY AMAY THEY CAN BE QUITE T QUITE VIVID I'M WHERE YOU RECOGNIZE OKE THERE THERE WAS A WAY OF BEING THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M TENDING TO ACCESS BY DEFAULT AND IT IS DIFFERENT IN IN WAYS THAT ARE JUST I YOU OBVIOUSLY BETTER AND AND AN PSYCHOLOGICALLY MORE HEALTHY AN MIT'S IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE HEALTHY PSYCHOLOGICALLY YOU N A WAY THAT I I NEVER IMAGINE RIGHT AND THE THEN WHEN YOU BETHEN WHEN YOU LINK IT UP TO THE TRADITIONAL LITERATURE AROUND ANY OF THIS STUFF AGAIN SO MUCH OF IT IS SHOT THROUGH WITH WITH SUPERSTITION AND OTHER WORLDLINESS OF OF RELIGION AND AT YOUNISE AS YOU KNOW ONE I THINK YOU'RE LISTEN LISTENER'S PROBABLY KNOW I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME CRITICIZING ALL THAT BUT THERE IS A BABY IN THE BATH WATER TO ALL OF THAT RIGHTS I GUESS IT'S NOT THAT SOMEBODY LIKE JESUS OR THE BUDDHA OR ANY OF THE MATRIARCHS AND PATRIARCHS OF THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE WERE ALL CONSCIOUS FRAUDS OR YOU KNOW TEMPORALOB EPILEPTICS OR LIKE THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A PATHOLOGICAL LENDS THAT YOU CAN PUT ON TOP OF ALL THAT BUT ONCE YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE EXPERIENCES ON PSYCHODELICS OR ON A DRUG LIKE EMPDY A MAY YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A THERE THERE YOU KNOW THAT UNCONDITIONAL LOVE IS IS A POSSIBILITY RIGHT YOU KNOW THAT THAT I FEELING TRULY ONE WITH NATURE RIGHT I MAY JUST SO ONE WITH NATURE THAT YOUR YOU COULD SPEND TEN HOURS IN FRONT OF A TREE AND FIND THAT TO BE THE MOST REWARD ING EXPERIENCE OF YOUR OF YOUR LIFE RIGHT THAT'S A POSSIBLE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS NOW MAY IT MAY NOT BE THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS YOU WANT ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW YOU DO'TWANT TO BE THE CRAZY GUY BY THE TREE YOU KNOW WHO CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE BUT ONCE YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE EXPERIENCES YOU RECOGNIZE OKE THERE'S THAT THERE'S SOME REASON WHY I'M NOT HAVING THE BEATIFIC VISION RITE NOW AND I CAN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO AIM MY ATTENTION SO AS TO HAVE ANYTHING LIKE IT AND THAT'S A PROBLEM RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT AND IT'S IT'S THE BEST YOU KNOW IT IT IS AMONG THE BEST THINGS THAS IT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME RIGHT AND NOW I'M CAN ONLY DIMLY REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS LIKE I SO HOW DO I GET BACK THERE ON SOME LEVEL AND THAT SEETS THAT INVITES AGAIN A LOGIC OF CHANGES A LOGIC OF SEEKING CHANGES IN THE CONTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH SET SOMEONE UP FOR THIS THIS IM PROTRACTIT OR SEEMINGLY PROTRACTED AND AND IN A FAIRLY FRUSTRATING SEARCH TO YOU KNOW GAME THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO AS TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES MORE AND MORE I AND AGAIN IT'S NOT THAT THAT'S IMPRINCIPLE FRUITLESS BUT IT IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THE CORE INSIGHT OF IN THE CORE WISDOM OF WE KNOW WHAT I WOULD TAKE FROM ENT A TRADITION LIKE BUDDHISM WHICH I'S NOT IN I'S NOT THE ONLY TRADITION THAT HAS GIVEN VOICE TO THIS BUT ITS I WOULD ARGUE HIS GIVEN IT YOU VOICED TO IT THE MOST IN THE MOST ARTICULATE WAY 'M AGAIN LEAVING ASIDE ANY OF THE SUPERSTITION AND AND OTHER WORLDLINESS AND MIRACLES THAT YUYOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT AT THE MOMENT I YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TO ENDORSE IN ORDER TO BE INTERESTEDN THIS OF I'M AND SO THAT'S THE THE BYFRICATION BETWEEN THE ALL OF THE UTILITY OF PSYCHODELICS AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT UNDER THE RUPRIC OF MEDITATION IS AT THIS POINT OF OQUE ONCE YOU REALIZE THERS THAT THERE THERE WHAT DO YOU DO AND WAT'S THE LOGICT BY WHICH YOU'RE LED TO DO IT AND IT'S POSSIBLE WITHHA IF IF YOUR ONLY FRAME WORK IS THE GOOD EXPERIENCES THE GOOD FEELS YOU HAD ON ON A WHATEVER DRUG IT WAS AND A A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OF LIKE WHAT THAT PATH OF CHANGES YOU KNOW CAN LOOK LIKE AND I CAN BCOME IN A RELIGIOUS CONTEXT YUCOMEIN JUST A PURELY PSYCHODELIC CONTEXT OR RE OF SOME COMBINATION OF THE TOO IM I THINK YOU CAN BE MISLED TO IYOU CAN JUST BN BE MISLED TO JUST SEEK LOTS OF PIQUE EXPERIENCES YOU TRYING TO STRING TOGETHER A LOT OF PIQUE EXPERIENCES HOPING THE'RE GONG TO CHANGE YOU EVERY ONE OF WHICH BY BY DEFINITION IS GOING TO BE IMPERMANENT RITAMITS IT'S ITS FIRST IT WASN'T THERE THEN IT'S THERE AND THEN IT'S NO LONGER THERE AND THEN YOUVE GOT A MEMORY OF IT RIGHT THE QUET WHAT I THINK IT'S WHAT EVERY ONE REALLY WANTS WHETHER THEY KNOW IT OR NOT AND THEIR RIGHT TO WANT IS A TYPE OF FREEDOM THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH EVEN ORDINARY STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH WHICH CAN RIDE ALONG WITH THEM INTO EXTRAORDINARY STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND SO WHAT I HADN'T DONE PSYCHODELICS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS CAUSE I MET AGAIN THEY WERE SUPERUSEFUL FOR ME IN THE BEGINNING THEN I DISCOVERED MEDITATION ON THE BASIS OF OF THOSE EXPERIENCES GOT REALLY INTO MEDITATION AND REALIZED LIOK KET THIS IS A MUCH MORE OR THIS REALLY IS THE YOU CONCEPTIONALLY THIS MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE TO ME THIS IS DELIVERING THE GOODS YOU KNW IN TERMS OF MY EXPERIENCE I'M THERE'S NO NEED TO KEEP HAVING THESE YOU KNW SEEKING THSE PIQUE EXPERIENCES WITH WITH DRUGS BUT IT BEEN OUN A TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE I A DONE THAT AND AND TIT WAS IS RESURGENTS AND RESEARCH ON PSYCODELIC AND I WAS BEING ASKED ABOUT PSYCODELICS AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE UTILITY FOR ME BUT AGAIN THESE WERE DISTANT MEMORIES AND SO I AND THERE WAS ALSO ONE TYPE OF PSYCODELIC EXPERIENCE I WAS I WAS AWARE THAT I HAD NEVER HAD I HAD NEVER DONE A HIGH DOSE OF MUSHROOMS I BLINDFOLDED YOU KNOW I EVERY EVERY MUSHROOM TRIP I'D EVER HAD IAD BEEN OUT NATURE AND INTERACTING WITH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW ISS BEEN A VERY TRANSFORMED SENSORY EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD AND OF OTHER PEOPLE IT HAD NEVER DONE IN ALONE BLINDFOLD AD JUST PURELY INWARDLY DIRECTED AND AT  A HIGH DOSAGE IAD DONE HIGH DOSES OF ELISTY BUT I'M BUT NOT I MUSHROOMS I'M SO I DID THAT YOU KNOW AND IT WAS VERY USEFUL AND I I  SPOKE ABOUT IT ON MY PODCASTNESS ECTUALLY TIS I THINK IF YOU SEARCH A SAM HARIS MUSHROOM TRIP ON YOU TWO IF YOU GET THE THE TE NINETEEN MENUTE VERSION OF THAT OF MY DESCRIBING THAT DRIP IT WAS INCREDIBLY USEFUL AND BUT IT WHAT WAS HAT WAS DOUBLY USEFUL WASE MY MINDFUL N THESS TRAINING IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT EXPLOSION OF SYNESTHESIA I MEAN IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS SUCH AN OVERWHELMINGLY STRONG EXPERIENCE I'M AND THERE WAS SO MANY IT MOMENTS WEAR IT COULD HAVE GONE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BASED ON MY SENSE OF JUST OQUET IAM GOING TO TRY TO RESIST THIS YOU KNOW IT WAS S LIKE IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS TRUTH IRRESISTIBLE BECAUEI F JUST SO MUCH BUT I'M THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE I WAS AWARE OF OQET THIS IS LIKE LETTING GO OF SELF YOU  KIN THIS CONTEXT IS IS THE THING THAT IS GOING TO YOU KNOW TIS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL HERE YOU KNOW AND ECAUSE THERE IS THERE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE SO EXTREME HYOU CAN'T EVEN TELL OF ITS AGONY OR ECSTASY IT'S JUST IT'S JUST THIS EVERYTHING IS TURNED UP TO ELEVEN RIGHT AND IT IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS LIKE YOU KNOW THE TIPPING POINT IS JUST S ON IT REALLY HAS KOND OF A HIGHWIE ACT IN SOME SENSE CUN JUST FALL TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND I'M YES SO WHAT I THINK PEOPLE WANT IS I'M THEY CERTAINLY ONE O BE ABLE TO EXTRACT FROM THE PSYCODELIC EXPERIENCE WISDOM THAT IS APPLICABLE TO ORDINARY STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS S LIKE WHAT IS THE THING YOU CAN REALIZE Y IN A MOMENT OF HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR CHILD THIT ISN'T DISTRACTING YOU FROM THAT RELATIONSHIP IT'S NOT A MEMORY OF WHEN THE WORLD DISSOLVED OR YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SKY BUT IT'S JUST A WAY OF OF A WAY OF EHAVING FREE ATTENTION AND UNCONDITIONAL LOVE IN THIS YOU KNOW TOTALLY ORDINARY AND POTENTIALLY CHAOTIC HUMAN EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW WHICH CAN BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY FRAUGHT AND YOU CAN MEET YOU KNOW ITTERATIONS OF YOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT EQUIPPING YOU TO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE PERSON IN THAT RELATIONSHIP AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS CUT THROUGH ALL OF THAT AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW BE IN LOVE WITH OUR LIVES AND WITH THE PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES MORE AND MORE THE TIME AND  THAT'S PY THERE'S I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S THE PSYK YOU KNOW THAT REPEATED PSYCHODELIC JEURNEYS AREN'T CAN'T BE INTIGRAL TO THAT PROJECT BUT BUT YOU KNOW THAT IT THAT THE PROJECT CAN'T BE BEING HIGH ALL THE TIME RIHT SO WHATEVER IS EXTRACTABLE FROM THAT THE THE  THE OCCASIONAL YOU KNOW PSYCHODELIC TRIP HAS GOT TO BE MAPABLE INTO ORDINARY WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE POINT OF CONT THE REAL POINT OF CONTACT DOES CAN RUN THROUGH THIS YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLING THE ILLUSION OF THE SELF AND AAGAIN IT IS TO THAT PART IS DISCOVERABLE WITHOUT ANY CHANGES IN CONTENTS RIGHT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SUDDENLY FEEL THE ENERGY OF YOUR BODY BE RUSH OUT AND BE CONTINUOUS WITH THE TA THE OCEAN OF ENERGY THAT IS NOT YOUR BODY RIGHT LIKE IT THAT'S AN EXPERIENCE THAT'S THERE TO BE HAD RII IS NO DOUBT BUT THIS THE TRUTH IS JUST LOOKING AT THIS CUP IS JUST AS FORMLESS AND AS MYSTERIOUS AS THAT RIGHT WHEN T IS SEEN IN THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT MEAN O MEDITATION ENCOURAGES  WANT TO RECOGNIZE WHY SHARE THE EXPERIENCE THAT EMDIAMA O SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED MY PERCEPTION OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF AN EMOTIONAL STANCE TOWARD SELF AND OTHERS YE INCLUDING THE ANIMALS RIHT SOMETHING THAT RUNS VERY DEEP FOR ME IN THAT I BEEN KOND OF ACTIVELY SUPPRESSING IN IN SUSPICION AMY DOG DOWN BUT ALSO I MEAN I'M NOT A I DO'T KNOW HOW TO FRAMEMENT EXCEPT TA SAT YOU KNOW MY LAB DID ANIMAL RESEARCH FOR YEARS AND I WAS ALWAYS VERY CONFLICTED ABOUT IT YE BECAUSE I LOVE ANIMALS AND YET I WANT T UNDERSTAND THE BRAIN AND WE NEEDS O WORK ON ANMAL BRAINS AND I WE RODENCE OR A YT I'LL BE VERY DIRECT ABOUT THIS MY LABORATE I'VE WORKED ON MANY SPECIES I'VE WORKED ON AM MICE AN RATS I'VE WORKED ON AM ADMIDLY I'VE WORKED ON I DENE SOME CAT EXPERIMENTS I'VE WORKED ON A LARGE NON HUMAN PRIMATES IN C INCLUDING MC CACS A I NO LONGER WORK ON ANY OF THOSE SPECIES  I'VE WORKED ON CUTTLEFISH ZEPHLOPOGS IA A DISCUSSION FOR ANOTHER TIME BRILLIANT LITTLE AS ETRETURS MAYBE MAYBE AS SMART AS US OR WHO KNOWS A MAYBE SMARTER AND NOW I WORK ON HUMANS BECAUSE I COULDN'T RECONCILE THE CHALLENGE INSIDE ME WHICH WAS MY LOVE OF ANIMALS AND WORKING ON THEM I JUST COULDN'T DO IT ANY LONGER N AN EMDY A MAY DIDN'T SET THAT TRANSITION UM THAT TRANSITION ACTUALLY BEEN SET A LOT EARLIER NOW SOMETHING I REALLY GRAPPLED WITH IT DIDN'T KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND IN ANY EVENT I HOPE WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS UM WAS WORTH WHILE BUT THIS IS A THAT'S A BIGGER DEBATE AND I'VE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS AND MAYBE IT'S A TOPIC FOR AN ANOTHER PODCAST UM BUT I'M VERY HAPPY THAT NOW I WORK ON HUMANS AND THEY CAN TELL ME IF THEY WON'T BE PART OF THE EXPERIMENT OR OT AND AND I TRUST THEM AND AI TRUST THEIR ANSWERS I THINK THAT EMDY A MAY HAVE  IN ITS ROLLAS AN AND PATHAGAND I THINK REALLY DID SED AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S REAL AND TRUE SO THINK TRUTHS LIKE THAT BECUM UM HEY DON'T I FELT THAT THEY DIDN'T HIT ME SQUARE IN THE FACE I JUST COULD THE FEELING BEHIND THE CONFLICT MADE ITSELF EVIDENT AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT MADE ITSELF EVIDENT SO I SUPPOSE EMDY A MA DID I  DID ASSIST THE TRANSITIONTO PURELY HUMAN RESEARCH AS SUPPOSE TO M IN OR SEARCH OM THE OTHER THING THAT I NOTICE IT IT IS IT UM IT MADE IT NOT SCARY TO CONFRONT THINGS THAT WERE SCARI TO CONFRONT IN MY CONSCIOUS LIFE AND I COULD THINK ABOUT THINGS IN MY CONSCIOUS LIFE BUT IT MADE YOU KNOW IT BROUGHT THEM CLOSE IN A WAY THAT I COULD GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE FLAME AND THEN GAIN SOME UNDERSTANDING I'V I'VE STILL UM I AMAZED AT HOW ANSWERS ARRIVE BOTH DURING THE SESSION AND IN THE WEEKS IN MONTHS THAT FOLLOW IF ONE PUTS THE ATTENTION TO IT I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE A GUIDE OF SOME SORD OR TO HAVE SOME SOME PSEUDO STRUCTURE BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU CAN ONE CAN GET ATTACHED TO THE SOUNDS IN THE ROOM AN JUST AND THERE'S PROBABLY MEANING THERE BUT I WANTED TO DO SOME DEEPER WORK I HAVE NOT HAD EXPERIENCE WITH SYLICIVAN AT LEAST NOTSONS MY YOUTH AND I DON'T RECOMMEND YOUNG PEOPLE DO IT I REGRET DOING ELISTY IN SYLICIBAN AS A YOUNG PERSON I DON'T SAY THAT FOR POLITICALLY CORRECT REASONS OR LIABILITY REASON I JUST THINK F MY MIND WAS NOT DEVELOPED AND M BUT I'M INTRIGUE BY SOMETHING SO HERE'S THE QUESTION HOW IS IT THAT SYLICIBAN IN PARTICULAR AND HYDOSYLICIBAN AND THE EGO DISSOLUTION THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT R'M SYLICBBAN HOW DO YOU THINK THAT UM LINES UP WITH SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT A YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBING FOR A ADEQUATE MEDITATION PRACTICE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT EXPERIENCE ON EMDY AMAY IN FACT IF ANYTHING I EXPERIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT UM REALLY FEELING LIKE A A ISOLATED CONTAINER I WAS IN THE DIFFERENCE BEAND HOW EMPATHY AND BEING BOUNDED HAVING ANOTHER WORDS GOOD BOUNDARIES AN EMPATHY COULD BE SIN BIOTIC I EXPERIENCE THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE AND I I DO THINK THAT THERE IS LEARNING INSIDE OF THESE STATES THAT TRANSLATES INTO EVERYDAY LIFE WHEN ONE AS NOT ON THESE STATES THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS NO I DON'T FEEL THE U THE IMPULSE TO GO AND DO TWENTY MORE EMDY AMASESSIONS I THINK THAT THE THREE IS PART OF THIS STUDY UM WERE A VERY EFFECTIVE FOR ME AND YOU KNOW AS THEY SAY IF YOU HEAR THE CALLING AGAIN YET YOU MIGHT DO IT BUT I'M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT SYLICIDE AND INPARTICULAR AND MUST NOTION OF EGO DISSOLUTION BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESELF WAT SO SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE SENSE OF SELF CAN BE A ROADED OR EXPANDED OR THIS LOTS OF EXPERIENCES THAT CAN STILL HAVE A KIND OF CENTERE TO THEM BUT BE OU VERY NOVEL AND AND TRANSFORMATIONAL A AND ONE CAN REAFY THOSE AS A KIND OF GOAL STATE RIGHT AND IT'S SORT OF THAT THERE'S A CONCEPTANT IN BUDDHISM THAT I THINK IT'S USEFUL IT DOESN'T TRANSLATE WELL TO ENGLISH IN OR CAN SET UP BA O A FALSE ASSOCIATIONS IN ENGLISH THAT THAT ARE UNFORTUNATE BUT SO TIT'S A CONCEPT OF EMPTINESS IN BUDDHISM WHICH A SOUNDS AGAIN KIND OF GRAY AND DISPERITING IN ENGLISH BUT IT'S A A WHAT IT THE WHAT IT'S IT'S RECOGNATE TERMS ARE OR THINGS LIKE UNCONDITIONE UNCONSTRAINED OPEND SANTRELESS RISO ITS IT'S A THERE'S A AND AND THAT IS SWHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT NON DUALIDY WHEN TALKING ABOUT THAT  THE LOSS OF A SENSE OF SUBJECT AND THN WHAT'S LEFT IN BUDDHISM THAT THEY WOULD OFTEN DESCRIBE WHAT'S LEFT AS EMPTINESS BUT IT EMPTINESS IS NOT A SOMETHING IT'S NOT A IT'S INNOCENT IMPORTANTLY ITS NOT THE SAME THING AS UNITY WRITE SO IS NOT IS NOT A ONE AS RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S LAT WHEN WHN THE CENTER DROPS OUT OF EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ARE SUDDENLY MERGED WITH THE CUP RIGHT IT'S IT BUT NOW GRANTED AT IN HATTHIS IS WHERE SYLICIPEN ANOTHER PSYCHODELICS CAN GIVE A FALSE IMPRESSION OF I THINK WHAT THE GOAL IS YOU CAN HAVE KIND SEEMING MERGING EXPERIENT YOUCAN HAVE UNITY EXPERIENCES ON PSYCHODELICS WHICH CAN BE QUITE POWERFUL ESPECIALLY WITH NATURE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND WITH NATURE WHERE YOU CAN JUST FEEL LIKE THING OF THE THE ENERGY OF YOUR BODY BECOMES A IT INCREDIBLY VIVID AND POWERFULS S LIKE IT LIKE YOUR JUST EVERYTHING IS JUST MEAN A BUZZING WITH IN A LIFE ENERGY AND THEN HEN YOU YOU KNOW TOUCH ANOTHER PERSON'S HAND OR YOU TOUCH A TREE THERE CAN BE THIS CONTINUITY OF ENERGY WHICH CAN BE THIS OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCE OF AND AGAIN THIS IS A A A JUST A TWENTY MEGATON CHANGE IN THE CONTENTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS RI THIS LIKE THIS IS NOT NON ORDINARY STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS BUT LIKE IIS IIS A GIVE SOME INDICATION OF WHAT OF HOW THIS HAPPENS WHEN BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS A IN MY TWENTIESN I WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH WITH A THIS ZEALOUSTY BUT A SOME FRIENDS AND I A DECIDED WE HAV THIS BRILLIANT IDEA WE WOULD WOULD CAMP ABOVE MERE WOODS AND THEN TAKE OME IS A ELLESTAY AT DAWN AND THEN WALK DOWN YOU ABLIKE A A MILE I THINK FROM THE CAMPSIDE INTO TE INTO THE ACTUAL PROPER GROVE OF TREES AND AND OU A COMMUNE WITH THE GIANT REDWOODS THE TALLEST TREES ON EARTH A AS WE DROPPE THE ACID AT DAWN AND WE START WALKING BUT THE ACID CAME ON YOU KNOW ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND WE DIDN'T GET I'M GOT NOWHERE NEARER THE WOODS AND WE GOT STOPPED BY A TREE THAT WAS JUST LIKE A AN ORDINARY N O TWENTY FOOT OAK TREE LIKE THE MOST BORING TRYE IN THE WORLD AND THAT TREE ABSORBED LIKE THE NEST NEXT SIX HOURS OF OUR OTHERISE A CONSCIOUS ATTENTION BECAUSE IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE TREE OF LIFE IM IT WAS AS I COULD ETHER  OULD BE NO BETTER TREE A SO THRE'S IT WERE TONING BUT NON ORDINARY STATES OF CONCONSCIOUSNESS WHERIN A EMERGING WITH LIFE AND WITH WITH THE WORLD IS POSSIBLE AND THAT IS A SO I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE ISN'T POSSIBLE BUT THERE'S A SORT OF A EXPANDED SELF REIFICATION IS IT IS A KIND OF EGO DISSOLUTION BUT THERE'S THERE'S A KIND OF IGOITY THIS SORT OF GOES ALONG FOR THE RIDE AS WELL OR CAN GO ALONG FOR THE RIDE AND THE REAL INSIGHT UND EMPTINESS THE REAL SORT OF CENTRELESS YOU KNOW CENTR OF THE BULL'S EYE I'S A RECOGNITION THAT THAT IN SOME WAYS EQUALIZES ALL EXPERIENCES AND MAGAN ITS IT'S IT'S JUST AS AVAILABLE NOW IN THE THIS ORDINARY YOU KNOW PODCASTING EXPERIENCE AS IT IS WHEN YOU'RE MERGING HANDS ON WITH AN OAK TREE AND YOU KNOW ON YOU KNOW FOUR HUNDRED MICROGRAMS OF ACID AND THIS IS OU N OF THE THIS IS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE AM AND AS SO IT' IT'S IT'S THE IT'S THE EQUALITY OF THOSE TWO EXPERIENCES THAT THAT THAT IS THIS CONCEPT OF EMPTINESS CAPTURES WHICH A COMCONCEPT OF ONENESS DOESN'T QUITE CAPTURE IE'S ONENESS I'S REALLY THIS THIS PIQUE EXPERIENCE OF BEING DRAGGED OUT OF YOR OR YOU KNOW YOU'RE SOMETHINGNESS INTO A MUCH BIGGER SOMETHINGNESS RIGHT EMPTINESS IS JUST NO CENTER RIGHT AND THAT EVERYTHING IS IN ITS OWN PLACE RIGHT THERE'S STILL SIGHTS AND SOUNDS AND SENSATIONS AND THOUGHTS AND FEELINGE BUT THERE'S JUST THERE'S NO THERE'S NO CENTER AND THERE'S NO CLINGING TO ANYTHING THERE'S NO CLINGING TO IDENTITY THERE'S NO CLINGING TO THE GOOD STUP THERE'S NO THERE'S NO RESISTANCE TO THE BAD STUFF THERE'S NOT THIS  SO PLEASANT AND UNPLEASANT GET SORT OF STRANGELY EQUALIZED AND THERE'S AS VERY AS IT'S IT'S VERY EXPANSIVE AND IT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT DOESN'T BLOCK ANYTHING SO YET IF FOR WHATEVER REASON IF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS SET UP TO HAVE THE OH MY GOD I'M NOW MERGING WITH THE TREE EXPERIENCE THAT'S BEST POSSIBLE FROM THE STATE OF NO CENTER RIGHT AND THEN AND AND ON MY YOU KNOW THAT MY RECENT  NOW NOT SO RECENT THREE EARS AGO WAS RIHT BEFORE COVIT A BUT MY LAST YOU KNOW BIG PSYCHODELIC EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW THEREWS I WAS VERY MUCH EXPERIENCING THAT WHEREAS YOU KNOW IN SO FAR AS I YOU KNOW AT THE PIQUE THERE WAS NO ME TO REMEMBER ANY OF ANY OF THE STUFF BUT  N O IN SO FAR AS I COULD EXPERIMENT WITH IS THIS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE YOU KNOW THERE IS A KIND OF EQUALIZING TO THE THE EMPTINESS RECOGNITION EVEN IN THE IN THE PRESENCE OF A COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED NEARL PHYSIOLOGY AND AND SO THAT'S A AGAIN THERE'S THERE'S A POINT OF CONTACT IN THE THAT THE REAL POINT OF CONTACT BETWEEN PSYCHODELICS AND MEDITATION FOR ME IS BUT FOR MY EXPERIENCES ON PSYCODELICS  THERE'S I D THINK THERE THERE'S NO WAY I WOULDHAVE HAD THE FREE ATTENTION TO BE INTERESTED IN IN THE IN THE PROJECT AT ALL AM AND THERE OTHER ASPECTS ORE THE PROJECT IS NOT JUST HAVING THIS INSIGDET INTO SELFLESSNESS IT'S IT'S ALL OF THE ETHICAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT IS JUST WHAT KIND OF PERSON DO YOU WANT TO BE WHAT ARE YOUR VALUES WHAT'S WHAT WHAT IS A GOOD LIFE ALTOGETHER WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND BEEN A POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT AND THE CHANGES YOU CAN MAKE IN THE WORLD OR NOT MAKE OR IIS JUST INN WHAT KIND OF PERSON DO OU WANT TO BE THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A MUCH LARGER CONSIDERATION AND IM AS YOU DISCOVERED YEA INEXPERIENCE ON EMPTY AMAY CAND  REALLY YOU BOTH BOTH EXPAND YOUR MODEL OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND WHAT IS DESIRABLE WHAT IS NORMATIVE AN JUST WHAT KIND OF YOU KNOW WHAT KND OF SELF DO YOU WANT TO BE IN THE WORLD A AND IIT CAN ALSO HELP YOU CUT THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE INHIBITING YOU YOURE ACTUALIZING ANY OF THOSE POSSIBILITIES IN ORDINARY WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS I'VE CERTAINLY FOUND THAT TO BE THE CASE I MEAN YOU RAISE A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS THAT AM ONCE THESE LEARNINGS TAKE PLACE THESE UNDERSTANDINGS TAKE PLACE IN PSIDE OF PSYCHODELIC JOURNEYS AND A I DO BELIEVE THEY TRANSLATE TID NORAL PLASTICITY I DO WANT A I LIKE THE POINT FOR PEOPLE OFTENTIMES YOU WILL SAY YOU KNOW THIS I MUSHROOM OR THIS A PSYCODELIC A IT OPENS PLASTICITY BUT OF COURSE PLASTICITY HAS TO BE DIRECTED SOME PLACE PLASTISY IS JUST A PROCESS LIKE LIKE RACKING OR ANYTHING ELSE UNDERLYING NEURAL PROCESS AND I I THINK  IT'S A POSSIBLE FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COMPARTMENTS OF MY LIFE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY OM THESE THREE EMPTY AMAY SESSIONS BUT I A IN SOME WAYS I WONDER WHETHER NOT NOT JUST THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM AN MOR RESEARCH BUT ALSO A A A DEEPER REALIZATION OF THE LOVE FOR LEARNING AND SHARING INFORMATION I WON'T GO SO FAR TO SAY THIS PODCASTS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THAT PARTICULAR SESSION BUT THESE THINGS A THE SXPLAY OUT IN TUMULTIBLE DOMAINS OF THE SELF AND I DO THINK THAT AM THE KEY FEATURES THAT FEEL MOST IMPORTANT TO ME TO MENTION ARE THAT A IT REALLY IDENTIFI A TRUE LOVES THINGS THAT I TRULY HAVIN MAD ME LESS A LESS CAUTIOUS ABOUT FEELING HOW INTENSE THOSE LOVES REALLY ARE AND THEN ALSO LOWER THE INABITION POINT OF EXPLORING LIKE WHAT THAT WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN RATHER YNO AND ONE OF THE REANS THI BRING THE SUP AND WHY I THING IT SO IMPORTANT TAT YOU MENTION YOU KNOW A SISSUES AROUND POLITICS AND ETHICS AND MANYTHINGS HAVE ISPLAYED OUT FROM YOUR EXPLORATION OF PSYCHODELICS MEDITATION YOUR SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY IN ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE YOU AND OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY A SUBSET IS THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT I HERE ANCY SO MUCH OF WHAT I HERE AND SEE IN THAT CAN SELF HELP SPACE CONTRADICTS ITSELF AND LEADS BACK TO T THE ORIGIN WITHOUT A LOT OF A PROGRESS AND AND FOR INSTANCE WE HEAR YOU KNOW ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER BUT THAN OUT OF PSIDE OUT OF MIND YOU HEAR ABOUT RADICAL ACCEPTANCE BUT THEN WHAT OF ITS RADICAL ACCEPTANCE OF NON ACCEPTANCE RI DOMING THERE ARE SOME ACPERIENCES AND PEOPLE FOR WHICH I RADICALLY ACCEPT THE FACT TH I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM YOUR AND IS THAT SOME EMISUPOST TO TRANSCEND THAT SO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS I THINK THAT KEOPLE LOT OF PEOPLE FROM EXPLORING THINGS LIKE MEDITATION BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE WELL IS THE IDEA TO JUST BE OK WITH EVERYTHING IS RADICAL CCEPTANCE JUST LIKE WELL JUST ENABULLDOS ME WITH IT WITH WITH THINGS EVEN IF THERE U NOT I MIGAL AS TO SOMEHOW A SURPASS THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE HARMFUL AND I DON'T THINK THAT ACTUALLY THE WAY ANY OF THE SNUFFIS POST TO WORK ALTHOUGH I DON'T CLAIM TO BE THE AUTHORITY ON IT EITHER I YOU KNOW I THINK NOTIONS OF RADICAL ACCEPTANCE AND A RADICAL HONESTY AND AND ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SAYINGS THAT ONE CAN FIND OUT THERE ARE REALLY THE THE MOST SALIENT BEACONS AN GUIDES THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE IN ORDER TO TRY NAVIGATE TUPHARIAS IN THEIR LIFE INCLUDING THE RELATIONSHIP TO SELF BUT OTHERS AND POLITICAL OREENTATIONS AND SO I FEEL LIKE ALMOST ALL THOSE THINGS CAN BE USED TO ANCHOR DOWN IN A STANCE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE INFORMED OR TO OPEN UP TO IDEAS AND SO I THINK THE NONE OF THIS CAN REALLY BE SOLVED IN A SINGLE PRACTICE IT SOUNDS LIKE BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE TOLD US TO DAY IS THAT ONLY THROUGH A A A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE SELF AS IT REALLY IS AS OPPOSED TO THIS ILLUSION THAT YOU FRAMED UP COULD WE ACTUALLY ARRIVE AT SOME ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT FOR EACH AN EVERY ONE OF US YO MER THERE'S ONE GENERIC ANSWER THAT I THINK CAN BE EXTRACTED BOTH FROM PSYCHODE PSYCHODELICS AND FROM MEDITATION AND JUS FROM THINKING MORE CLEARLY ABOUT THE NATURE OFOUR LIVES AND IT'S IT'S TO BECOME MORE PROCESS ORANTED AND TO AND  CAN BE MORE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE THE MORAL THE MORATMORAGE LIKE CHARACTER OF OF ACHIEVING OUR GOALS RIGHT NII'M NOT I'M NOT AGAINST ACHIEVING GOALS I HAVE A LOT OF GOALS I'VE A KON I'M I'M VERY BUSIED AR LOTS OF THINGS I WANT TO GET DONE AND AND IE  I'M I'M AS SATISFIED AS ANY ONE TO FINISH A PROJECT AND BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIME COURSE OF ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW FULFILLMENT AND YOUUOUE FEW LESSONS EVERY ONE I THINK HAS TO DRAW ONE IS MOST OF YOUR LIFE IS SPENT IN THE PROCESS RIGHT LIKE LY GOGHT LIKE THE MOMENT AT WHICH THE GOAL IS IN A FULLY CONQUERED THAT IS JUST ME THAT HAS A YOU KNO IT'S A TINY DURATION AND IS VERY SHORT HALF LIFE AND YOU'RE IT IT THE MOMENT YOU YOU ARRIVE AT IT IT BEGINS TO RECEIVE BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME YOU HAVE ALL THSE OTHER GOALS THAT ARE HAVE APPEARED ON THE HORIZE AND YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE ASKING WHAT YOU'REGOING TO DO NEXT AND YOU  IN SOME SENSE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE FOCAS ON GOALS YOU'VE REALLY YOU CAN NEVER ARRIVE RIGHT AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR IN LIFE YOU KNOW WEATHER WE'RE EVER THINKING ABOUT SIGHT YOU TAKING SYCODELICS OR WERE PRACTISING SOMETHING LIKE MEDITATION WE'RE LOOKING FOR GOOD ENOUGH REASONS TO LET OR ATTENTIONFULLY REST IN THE PRESENT RIGHT NOWIT LIKE ITS THAT THAT IS THE LOGIC OF SUCCESS LIKE L THE SENT THE SENTLEC I'VE GOT AL THSE THINGS I WANT TO DO IF I COULD JUST GET RICH ENOUGH OR FIT ENOUGH OR YOU KNOW DILIN MY SLEEP WELL ENOUGH OR YOU IMPROVE MY LIFE AND ALL THESE WAYS GET THE RIGHT RELATIONSHIP WOULDN'T BE GREAT TO BE MARRIED ON I WANT TO START OF FAMILY I WANT ALL OF THESE THESE THINGS WHY DO I WANT THESE THINGS I WANT THESE THINGS BEGS I'M TELLING MYSELFTHIS ISN'T IT'S NOT THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE WONDERFUL RIGHT I'M NOT I'M NOT DISCOUNTING THOSE RELATIVE FORMS OF HAPPINESS OR SOURCES OF HAPPINESS CAUSE IT'S ALL COMPLETELY VALID TO IS ITS COMPLETE ABOUNT TO WANT THOSE THINGS BUT IN THE PRES IS FR ONE THING IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE MISERABLE IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THOSE THINGS RIGHT IT'S AND YOU CAN ADD YOU CAN ADD GREAT WEALTH AND FAME AND EVERYTHING ON TOP OF THAT IT'S I  POSSIBLE IT IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE ABSOLY MISERABLE HAVING EVERYTHING ANY ANY ONE COULD SEEMINGLY WANT RIGHT E JUST HAVE TO OPEN A NEWSPAPERS TO SEE PEOPLE LIVING OUT THAT PREDICAMENT RIGHT YOU KNOW I SPECTACULARLY WEALTHY FAMOUS HEALTHY  SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WHO COULD DO ANYTHING THEY WANT IN IN LIFE APPARENTLY AND YET THEY'RE DOING THIS THING THAT IS COMPLETELY DISFUNCTIONAL AND MAKING THEM I NEEDLESSLY MISERABLE IM I WON'T NAME NAMES BUT THERE ENOUGH OF A NOUTHON EVER COME TO MIND OF THE OMENT I'M SO SO THERE IS A THERE IS A CLEAR DISSOCIATION BETWEEN HAVING EVERYTHING AND HAPPINESS THAT'S POSSIBLE AND I'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO HAVE VERY LITTL YOU KNOW AND ALMOST NOTHING AND TO BE QUITE HAP LY I MAY YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE MET THESE PEOPLE BUT I HAVE MET PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPENT YOU KNOW TEN YEARS ALONE IN A CAVE RIGHT  KNO THEY COME OUT OF THAT CAVE NOT FLORIDLY NAURADIC OR PSYCHOTIC THEY COME AT AT CAVE BEAMING WITH COMPASSIOND AND JOY AND AM TIT'S LIKE THEYE BEEN TAKING EM TY AMAY FOR TEN YEARS ESSENTIALLY AND THEY COME OT OF THE CAVE AND TANT NOW THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT RGHT IM SO AND I'M NOT NETERELY RECOMMENDING THAT PROJECT ANY ONE IF I'M JURSTAND THAT IS THAT IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES WE HAVE A DOUBLED DISSOCIATION HERE WITH YOU CAN HAVE EVERYTHING ON BE MISERABLE WE CAN HAVE NOTHING AND BE BEAMING WITH WITH HAPPINESS IM SO WHAT IS IT THAT WE ACTUALLY WANT EN ALL OF OUR SEEKING TO ARRANGE OF THE PROPS IN OUR LIVES AND OUR AND OR AND THE STORY I HAVE A CONVINCING ENOUGH STORY TO TELL ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING AWHAT AR WHAT IS ALL OF THAT EFFORT PREDICATED ON IS PREDICATED ON THIS DESIRE AND THIS EXPECTATION THAT IF WE COULD GET ALL OF THIS STUFF IN THE RIGHT PLACS AND NOT HAVE ANYTHING TERRIFYING TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT EVERYONE WE LOVE IS HEALTHY FOR THE MOMENT RIGHT AND WE ARE HEALTHY AND THAT E WE'VE GOT SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO ON THE WEEK END AND THERE'S NOT SOME IT OES NOT O U KNOW PLUMBINGLAK IN THE HOUSE THAT WE HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO AND WE LIKE OUR HOUSE AND YOU KNOW OUR CAREER IS GOING FINE AND THERE'S SOMETHING GOOD TO WATCH ON NETFLICS AND WE HAVE ALL OF IT RIGHT NOW CAN WE JUST ACTUALLY GIVE UP THE WAR RIGHT CAN WE CAN WE CAN WE FULLY LOCATE OUR OUR SENSE OF WELL BEING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT IS IT CAN WE RELAX THE IMPULSE TO BRUD ABOUT THE PAST OR THINK ANXIOUSLY ABOUT THE FUTURE FOR LONG ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THAT ALL OF THIS HERE IS ENOUGH RIGHT BECAUSE OUR LIFE OUR LIFE IS WE HAVE THIS FINITE RESOURCE OF MWE ABSOLATLY HAVE THE FINITE RESOURCE OF TIME BUT WITHIN THIS THE THE FINITE RESOURCE  CONTINUUM OF TIME WE HAVE THE EVEN MORE PRECIOUS RESOURCE OF FRE ATTENTION THAT IS THAT THAT CAN FIND OR OURS OR OUR FULFILLMENT IN THE PRESENT RIGHT AND CAUSE EVEN IF WE'RE EVEN IF ORE GUARDING OUR TIME TO DO THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO US WE CAN SPEND ALL OF THAT TIME WORE YOU REGRETTING THE PAST OR BE O ANXIOUSLY EXPECTING THE FUTURE AND TELLING IT JUST BALANCING BETWEEN PASS AND FUTURE IN OUR THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES AN OUR LIVES AND BASICLLY JUST DANCING OVER THE PRESENT AND NEVER MAKING CONTACT WITH IT RIGHT SO WAT WE I THINK WHAT WE WANT IS AY'S A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE ATTENTION CAN BE LOCATED IN THE PRESENT IN A WAY THIS TRULY FULFILLING AND UNLESS YOU HAVE PAD SOME KIND OF RATICAL INSIGHT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT ON DEMAND ND YOU ARE IN SOME SENSE HOSTAGE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR LIFE TO DO IT DO THAT FOR YOU YOURE  YOURE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO TO ENGINEER A STATE OF THE WORLD THAT WILL PROPAGATE BACK ON A STATE OF SELF THAT WILL MAKE THE THE PRESENT MOMENT GOOD ENOUGH AND WHAT MEDITATION DOES AND PSYCHODELICS TO SOME DEGREE DOES THIS BUT MEDITATION VERY DIRECTLY DOES THIS IT REVERSES THE CAUSALITY AND N  LETS YOU ACTUALLY CHANGE CHANGE STATE SUCH THAT YOU CAN BE FULFILLED BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENS RIGHT NOTHING YOUYOURE HAPPINESS IS NO LONGER PREDICATED ON THE NEXT GOOD THING HAPPENING YOU CAN BEIN THE PRESENCE OF THE NEXT GOOD OR BAD THING ALREADY BEING FULFILLED AND  ALREADY BEEN TO PEACE YOU KNOW MTHIS THERE'S A THEN  THEYR MISLEADING NOUNDS WE CAN WE CAN THROW IT AT WHAT IS LEFT THERE BUT IT IS YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW TRANQUILLITY PEACE FREEDOM LACK OF CONTRACTION LACK OF CONFLICT A LIKE ALL THAT IS AY CAN BE MORE AND MORE OF A DEFAULT AND ALL THAT IS ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH DECIDING YOU KOW YET WHY NOT GET IN SHAPE WHY NOT ENGAGE THIS PROJECT WHY NOT YOU KNOW CHANGE YOUR CAREER M OU ITS NOT I S NOT THAT YOU NEED TO BE SOMEBODY WHO WHO EXO  YOUR POINT YOU CAN NOTE IS ALL OF THESE NONOPTIBLE THINGS BECAUS NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU MEDITATE YOU YOUYOU'RE VERY LIKEVERY LIKELY GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF YOUR TIME STILL LOST IN THOUGHT STILL IDENTIFIED WITH IT AND STILL WANTING STILL CARYING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DISFUNCTION AND AND NORMATIVITY IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT AND AN IS O THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN YOU WHAT CAN YOU LOCATE WHEND I'S REALLY 'S HOW MUCH CAN YOU PUNCTURE THAT SEEKING HAPPINESS PROJECT WITH DIRECOGNITION THAT YOU'RE ALREADY FREE THAT IS THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT MEDITATION MAKES POSSIBLE YOU CAN KEEP JUST A THOUSAND TIMES A DAY LETTING SOME DAYLIGHT INTO THIS SEARCH SPACE AND SO IT'S BUT IT IS STILL COMPATIBLE LIKE YOU CAN ME WORKING OUT IS A GREATE I FRAME AND WISH TO LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE ME WHAT IN WORKING OT WHEN YOU WHEN Y WHEN YOU REALLY WORK OUT YOU KNOW I'M THINKING YING MOSTLY OF MI'S REALLY I ANYTHING BUT IS SEEN RESISTANCE TRAINING OR CARDIO OR SOMETHING LIKE YOU GIT TO YOU YOUR INTENTIONALLY PUTTING YOURSELF IN CLASSICALLY UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCES PHYSIOLOGICALLY MIS OF IF YOU IF YOU WERE OU KNOW IMAGINE WHAT IS LIKE TO DO ANYTHING TO FAILURE RIGHT IF YOU JUST CHECK IN WHAT UN WHAT THAT IS LIKE AT THE LEVEL OF SENSATION I M THAT IS IS SPASICALLY A METIC IT'S FEELS LIKE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AND LIKE THAT IF YOU ARE HAPPING THAT EXPERIENCE OR SOME OTHER REASON IF YOU WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AND FELT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE DEAD LIFTING YOU KNOW ON YOUR TENTH RAP ON A ET WHERE YOU'RE GOING T YOU KNOW YOUYOU WOULD FAIL AT ELEVEN RIGHT BUT THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW THAT'S AN EMERGENCY BUT BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THE GAM AND YOU'VE SOUGHT IT OUT AND LIKE AS ACTUALLY IS ACTUALY SOMETHING U LIKE DOING RIGHT AND YOU CAN YOU CAN GET A REAL DOPENING YOU KNOW BUT IT FROM FROM DOING IT I'M THAT WHAT WHAS YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU'RE OING THAT IS YOU'RE YOUR OWNING A KIND OF A CY LIKE YOU'R YOU'RE ACTUALLY I TRANSFORMING A A CLASSICALLY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE INTO SOMETHING THAT'S IN ALMOST INTRINSICALLY POSITIVE RI CERTAINLY THE NET ON IT IS POSITIVE I'M YOU CAN DO THAT ND WN ND BEING ABLE TO DO THAT IS MORE AND MORE O THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING ACTUALLY AT PEACE EVEN WHILE EXERTING REALLY INTENSE EFFOR IN IN ONE DIRECTION SO YOU CAN BE STRAINING AND I'M SURE PHYSIOLOGICALLY SHOWING A LOT OF STRESS AND I 'M SURE THAT YOU CORT US ALL IS UP AND LIKE YOU KNOWYOU KNOW BLOOD PRAT PRESSURES UP HEART RATE IS CERTAINLY UP I'M IT SO AS LIKE IT'S IT'S AS FAR AS THE BODY'S CONCERNED IS IS OISTRESS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE BUT YOU REALLY CAN BE DEEPLY EQUONOMIUS AND AT PEACE BECAUSE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE FRAME AROUND IT BECAUSE OF THE CONCEPTS ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU KNOW WHAT IVS HAPPENING AND YOU WANT IT I'M YOU SO THAT THAT THAT'S AN ATTITUDE YOU CAN BRING INTO OTHER STRSSFUL THINGS THAT TAKE EFFORT TO ACCOMPLISH AND SO IT'S NOT IS NOT THAT OU JUST NEED TO BE A PUSH OVER WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO MEDITATEOR WHEN YOU TAKE MBIAMA OR DOANY YOUWE Y WORK ON YOURSELF IN ANY OF THESE WAYS BUT I'M WHAT I THINK YOU I THINK YOU WANT TO FIND AS YOU WANT TO FIND YOUR POINT OF REST IN THE MIDST OF O ANY STRUGGLE I WOULD SAIY THAT THE CERTAINLY EMPDY A MAY BUT AND IAGAIN I'VE LESS EXPERIENCE WITH MEDITATION AND I BUT THEY REALLY I THINK PUT US ULTIMATELY IMPOSITIONS OF WHAT CAN ONLY REFER TO IS REAL STRENGTH I SEE O MAKE WHAT BEFORE SEEM LIKE IMPOSSIBLE DECISIONS OR EVEN UM CONCEPTS OR EMOTIONAL STATES TO EVEN THINK ABOUT FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT DELIBERATELY DISTRACTING OR AVOIDING IN SOME OTHER WAY AND BE ABLE TO LEAN INTO THOSE WITH WITH OPEN EYES AND I THINK THAT'S UM TO ME THAT'S MY DEFINITION OF STRANGTH I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE CONSIDERED BUT U IM THERE'S I THERE'S DEAFILLY SOMETHING REAL THERE IN EACH CASE THIS MAY SEEM LIKE A DIVERGENCE BUT I AND MANY OTHER  PEOPLE ARE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT A RECENT DECISION THAT YOU MADE WHICH WAS TO CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT ON TWITTER I'M YOU STILL HAVE AN INSTRE ON ACCOUNT I NOTICE A BA EBID NEVER LET ME MY TEAM MANAGES THAT I IVE NEVER I

LITTERLLY HELP PEOPLE ON TWITTER LIE HE MEN THRE WAS A THERE WERE YOU NOTHER PEOPLE WHO I'VE RAISED LOS OF MUCH BUTMONEY FOR ON TWITTER JUST BY A SIGNAL BOOSTING THERE GO FON MES AND AND ISO I WAS ENGAGED IN A WAY THAT SEEMED PRODUCTIVE I'M BUT I WAS ALWAYS WORRIED THAT IT WAS PRODUCING NEEDLESS CON LICT FOR ME AND WAS WAS GIVING ME A SIGNAL IN MY LIFE THAT I WAS BEING LURED INTO RESPONDING TO AND N TAKING SERIOUSLY THAT WAS OUT OF PROPORTION TO IT'S IT'S REPRESENTATION OF ANY OPINION OR SET OF OPINIONS THAT I I SHOULD BE TAKING SERIOUSLY SO I WAS NOTICING THAT THAT I AGAIN THIS EVOLVED OVER YEARS AND THIS IS LONG BEFORE LONG ALONG LONG PREDATED I RECENT CHANGES IT'STO TWITTER I BUT I WAS NOTICING THAT MANY OF THE WORST THINGS THAT HAD HAPPEND FOR ME PROFESSIONALLY WERE FIRST BORNE ON TWITTER I'M JUST LIKE E SOME SOME CONFLICT I GOT INTO WITH SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING THAT I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO PODCAST ABOUT IN RESPONSE TO ONTWITTER I IT'S S SO MUCH OF IT WOUSD T IS EITHER IS GENISIS WAS TWITTER OR IT'S THE THE I THE FURTHER SPEEN OF IT THAT BECAME TRULY UNPLEASANT AND DISFUNCTIONAL HAPPENED ON TWIT LIKE IT WAS JUST TWITTER WAS PART OF THE STORY WHEN IT WAS GOT REALLY BAD AND I' I'VE HAD YOU KNOW VACATIONS THAT HAVE GONE SIDEWAYS JUST BECAUSE I GOT ON TWITTER AND SAID SOMETHING AN THAN I HAD TO PRODUCED A CONTROVERSY THAT I HAD TO RESPOND TO AND THET HAD TO DO A PODCAST ABOUT THAT AND BOUGHT AND JUST AND IT WAS JUST OKET THIS IS A MESS RIGHT AND SO AT THAT POINT OUN I WI YOU HAVE FRIENDS WHO YOUKNOW ALSO HAD BIG TWITTER PLATFORMS WHO WOULD WHO WOULD SAY YO WHY ARE YOU YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU RESPONDING TO ANYTHING ON TWITTER JUST TWEET AND GHOST IYOU O JUST DO TO HAVE IN LING GOL ROGUE AND YES IY DOWN AND T RE I TO GET GET OU NOW GIVE ME TALKING TO AS TO BILLMORE I AND BOTH OF THEM ENGAGED TWITTER IN THAT WAY MEN THEY I THINK THEY BASICALLY NEVER LOOK AT THERE ATMENTIONS THEY NEVER SEE WHAT'S COMING BACK AT THEM THEY JUST YOU KNOW THEY USED IT EFFECTIVELY THE WAY I USE OR DON'T EVEN USE INSTOR GRAMMAR FACE BOOK A MI DON'T EVEN SEE WHAT'S GOING OUT THERE  IN MY NAME I AND SO I I COULD ESSENTIALLY DO THAT FOR MYSELF ON TWITTER PRESUMABLY AND I DID THAT FOR SOME PERIODS OF TIME BUT THEN I WOULD CONTINUALLY DECIDE OKE NOW IT'S ALL BALANCE AGAIN MAYBE I CAN JUST COMMUNICATE YOU CAUE IT WAS VERY TEMPTING FOR ME TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BECAUSEI WOULD SEE SOMEBODY IT CLEARLY MISUNDERSTANDING SOMETHING I HAD SAID ON MY PODCAST AND I THINK ILIKE WHY NOT CLARIFY THIS MISUNDERSTANDING RIGHT AND IN IND MY EFFORTS TO DO THAT ALMOST INVARIABLY PRODUCED A  THIS  SOMETIMES IT WAS A KIND OF MIANGERING A PROCESS OF OF DISCOVERY BUT OFTEN IT WAS JUST KIND OF A STARK CONFONTATION WITH WHAT APPEARED TO ME TO BE JUST LUNACY AND MALEVEL ANCE ON A SCALE THAT I NEVER ENCOUNTER ELSEWHERE IN MY LIFE LIKE ID NEVER MEET THESE PEOPLE IN LIFE RIGHT I AND YET I WAS MEETING THESE PEOPLE BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS ON TWITTER AND SO IT WAS THE THE THING THAT BEGAN TO WORRY ME ABOUT IT AND AGAIN TIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE HAV THE OPPOSITE EXPERIENCE UNTWOME DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUT IN WHAT YOURE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF TOPICS YOURE TOUCHING YOU COULD HAVE JUST NOTHING BUT LOVE COMING BACK AT YOU ON TO IT I WRIGHT I BUT BECAUSE I'M VERY ESSENTIALLY IN THE CENTR E POLITICALLY AND BECAUSE I OMYISIS NOW ON MY PODCASTES S NOT IN THE WAKING UP AP I'M OFTEN CRITICIZING THE FAR LEFT AND CRITICIZING THE FAR RIGHT I'M BASICALLY PISSING OFF EVERY ONE SOME OF THE TIME I SAIY AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IF IF YOU'RE ONLY CRITICIZING THE LEFT YOU HATE IM NO DOUBT YOU GET HATE FROM THE LEFT BUT YOU HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT WHO JUST REFLECTIVELY AND TRIBALY ARE ARE EXPRESSING THEIR SOLIDARITY FOR YOU WRIGHT AND WHO ARE WHO ARE DON' KING ON YOUR ENEMIES FOR YOU AND YOU KNOW WHENT WHEN YOUR ENEMIES COME OUT OF THE WOOD WORK AND IF YOU'RE ONLY CRITICIZING THE RIGHT YOU GET A LOT OF PAIN FROM THE RIGHT BUT YOU'VE GOT THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT WHO RE TRIBLLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE LEFT WHO WERE WHO WERE JUST GOING TO REFLECTIVELY DEFEND YOU IF YOU'ARE IN THE CENTER CRITICIZING THE LEFT AS HARD AS ANY ONE ON THE RIGHT EVER CRITICIZED THE LEFT CRITICIZES THE LEFT AND YOU'RE ALSO CRITICIZING THE RIGHT AS HARD AS ANYONE ON THE LEFT CRITICIZES THE WRIGHT YOU ARE GETTING HATE FROM BOTH SIDE ALL THE TIME AND NO ONE IS REFLECT IF REREFLECIVELY AND TRBLY DEFENDING YOU BECAUSE YOU PISSED THEM OFF LAST TIME YOU LIKE YOU MIGHT BE GETTING HATE FROM THE LEFT NOW AND HA PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT AGREE WITH YOU BUT THEY CAN'T FORGET THE THING YOU SAID ABOUT TRUMP ON THAT PODCAST YOU KNOW YOU AW TWO PODCASTS AGO I'M SO THEY'RE NOT GOIN O DEFEND YOU AND SO WHAT I EI BASICALLY CREATED HELL FOR MYSELF ON TWITTER BECAUSE IT WAS AM I JUST I KNOW IT WAS JUST A THEATR OF WHICH UST PURE CACOPINY MOST OF THE TIME AND WHAT I WAS SEEING WAS AT ME LIKE TAS NO WAY THERES THIS MANY CYCHLE PATS IN THE WORLD BUT I WAS SEEING CYCHLE PASTS EVERYWHERE I WAS SEEING THE MOST MALICIOUS DISHONESTY AND I YOU KNOW JUST GOAL POST MOVING AND HYPOCRISY AND AND  IT WAS JUST A MIN SOME OF ITS TROLLING AND SOME OF ITS REAL CONFUSION AND SOME OF IT IS PCYCHOPOTHY BUT ITS LIKE IT WAS SO DARK THAT I'M I WORRIED THAT OU WAS ACTUALLY GIVING ME A A VERY NEGATIVE AND STICKY A VIEW OF HUMANITY THAT WAS IMA ONE IT WAS YOU KNOW I THINK IT ISN'T AT YOUAN ACCURATE BUT TOO IIT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS RETURNING TO SO MUCH BECAUSE IA GAN I WAS CHECKING TWITTER YOU KNOW AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES A DAY AND I'M SURE THEREWAS SOME DAYS WHERE I CHECKED AT A HUNDRED TIMES A DAY AND IT WAS IT WAS AGAIN IT WAS MY MAIN SOURCE OF INFORMATION AS CONSTATLY READING ARTICLES AND AND THE PUTTING MY OWN STUFF OUT I'M THAT IT BECAME THIS KIND OF FUN HOUSE MIRROR IN WHICH I WAS LOOKING AT THE THE MOST GROTESQUE SIDE OF OF HUMANITY AND FEELING  YOU KNOW IMPLICATED IN IN IN WAYS THAT WERE IMPORTANTLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST YOT WAS REPUTATIONALLY IMPORTANT OR SEEMED TO BE IMPORTANT I'M I KNOW A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THESE WEREN'T JUST FACELESS TROLLS THESE ARE THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH WHOM I HAVE HAD RELATIONSHIPS AND SOME CASES FRIENDSHIPS WHO BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU KNOW LARGELY TRUMP AND COVID DID TO OUR POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN THE LAST YOU KNOW HALF A DOZEN YOARS I'M WERE BEGINNING TO ACT IN WAYS THAT'S THAT THAT SEEMED HASTARCLLY DISHONEST AND AND YOU KNOW CRAZY MAKING TO ME SO I WAS JUST NOTICING THAT I WAS FORMING OF A VIEW OF PEOPLE WHO I ACTUALLY HAVE HAD DINNER WITH THAT WAS WAY MORE NEGATIVE BASED ON THEIR TWITTER BEHAVIOR THEN I THINK WOULD EVER BE JUSTIFIED BY ANY WAY THEY WOULD BEHAVE IN LIFE WITH ME YOU KNOW I MEAN THAS LIKEA NEVER I WAS NEVER GOIG TO HAVE A FACE TO FACE ENCOUNTER WHEN ANY OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WAS THIS MALICIOUS AND DISHONEST AND GAS LIGHTING AND WEIRD RIGHT AS AS WHAS WHAT WAS TO HAPPENING HOURLY ON TWITTER IHT AND SO I JUST BEGAN TO BECOME MORE SENSITIVE TO WHAT THIS WAS YOU KNOW JUST THE RESIDUE OF ALL THIS IN MY LIFE AND HOW AND JUST HOW OFTEN THE WORST THING THAT THE WORST THING ABOUT ME IN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE YOU KNOTHER JUST TALKING TO MY WIFE OR MY KIDS WAS JUST THE FACT THAT I HAD BEEN ON TWITTER AT SOME POINT IN OU PREVIOUSLY IN   THE PREVIOUS HOUR AND THERE WAS SOME RES ADO OF THAT YOU KNOW YOU'V YOU KNOW IN MY INTERACTION WITH THEM YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S TRUSSED OUT ABOUT WHAT RE YOU ANNOYED ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU PISSED OFF ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT CAN'T YOU GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD I'M WHAT IS THE THING THAT YOU NOW FOU LIKE YOU NEED TO SPEND THE NEXT WEEK OF YOUR LIFE FOCUSSED ON BECAUSE IT WENT SO SIDEWAYS FOR YOU ALL OF THAT WAS TWITTER YOU KNOW A A LITTLE AMA LITTLY A HUNDRED PERCENTED IT WAS TWITTER AD AND SO I'M I JUST AT ONE POINT I IT WAS ICKION ON THANKSGIVING DAY I JUST LOOKED AT THIS I JUST JUST AMANIT THEREAS VERY LITTLE THOUGHT WENT INTO IT I MEAN LITERALLY I'MADI YU KNOW THERE WAS MORE THOUGHT IN INVOLVED THAN YOU  WHETHER I WANTED COFFEE WHEN YOU ASKED ME WHEN I SHOWED UP HERE I MAS JUST LIKE IT AS CERTAIN PHY JUST I JUST SAW IT AND I JUST I JUST RIPPED THE BANDIT OFTEN AND YE SO I'M AND TO ANSWERED YOUR OTHER QUESTION IT'S BEEN ALMOST WHOLLY PONT POSITIVE AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT GIVEN THAN THE LIT ME OF OF A PAYING AN DISTCOMFORT I JUST RAN THROUGH BUT I'M I BEEN IT'S ALSO IT'S IT IT'S SURPRISING TO RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH OF A PRESENCE IT WAS IN MY LIFE GIVEN THE SENSE OF WHAT IS NOW MISSING I MAST LIKE THER THERE'S IT WAS THER'S NO QUESTION THERE WAS IN ERSAN A NINDICTIVE COMPONENT TO IT AND WHEN YOU SEE I M LIKE WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT ELANS DOING ON TWITTER FORGET ABOUT HIS OWNERSHIP OF IT AND AM I'M NOT YOU KNOW I HAVE GOT A LOT TO SAY ABOUT YTHE CHOICE AS HE'S MAKING I FOR THE PLATFORM BUT JUST HIS PERSONAL USE OF IT IS JUST SO OBVIOUSLY IN EXPRESSION OF M I DON'T NO TA DICTION IS THE YOU KNOW CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE I'M TERM BUT YOU KNOW HIS DISFUNCTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO TWEED TO USING THE PLATFORM FORGET AGAIN T FORGEN FORGET ABOUT CHANGING IT AND OWNING IT BUT JUST HITHE JUST THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT IS POINTLESSLY DISERRUPTIN THE LIFE OF ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE IN ANY GENERATION I'M II THAT WAS ALSO INSTRUCTIVE TO MEKAUS I BECAUS I KNOW HELON I IIIJUS YOU KNOW I'M HE'S FROM WUT YOU KNOW  I'VE A FRIENDS I VIEW OF THE SITUATION IT'S SO OBVIOUSLY NOT GOOD FOR HIM THAT HE'S SPENDING THIS MUCH TIME ON TWITTER I'M THAT A I I I JUST BROUGHT THAT BACT TO ME IS LIKE WELL IT IS NOT THIS IS WHAT IS DOING TO EELON AND HE'S GOT ALL THIS OTHER THINGS HE COULD BE DOING WITH HIS ATTENTION HOW MUCH OF MY USE OF TWITTER IS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW A GOOD IDEA AND YOU NO OPTIMIZED TO MY WELL BEING AN THE WELL BEING AT THE PEOPLE AROUND MEN I'M SO ANYWAY IT WAS THERE WAS AN ADDICTIVE COMPONENT TO IT I THINK AND S SO WHEN THAT GOT STRIPPED OFF I YOU KNOW I I DO NOTICE THAT THERE'S AND THERE'S SOME THIRD TIMES I PICK UP MY PHONE I REALIZE IT THIS IS LIKE THE OLD ME PICKING UP MY PHONE FOR I FOR REASON THAT NO LONGER EXISTS THAT IS NOT THAT MUCH I AN I W I HAVE A SLACK CHANNEL WITH MY TEAME AND I'VE GOT YE MALE OBVIOUSLY BUT S LIKE THAT IS NOT MUCH OF WHAT I WAS DOING WITH MY PHONE REALLY IN THE END AND SO LIKE IT'S JUST MY PHONE IS MUCH LESS OF A PRESENCE IN MY LIFE AND AND SO IT'S IT'S ALMOST WHOLLY GOOD BUT I'M YET I IS YOU KNOW THERE'S I THINK THERE IS SOME DANGER IN I OR SOME SOME A POSSIBLE DANGER IN LOSING TOUCH WITH  CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CULTURE WHICH AGAIN I'M NOT EVEN SURE  THIRS IS QUESTION OF OOW HOW MUCH IS TWITTER REAL LIFE AND HOW MUCH IS A JUST A MASSED ILLUSION II DON'T KNOW BUT IN SO FAR AS IT ACTUALLY MATTER IS WHAT HAPPENS ON TWITTER I'M OR IN SO FAR AS I WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A NEWS DIET WHICH I'M NOT GOINGTO BE ABLE TO RECAPITULATE FOR MYSELF OR I'M JUST NOT IN FACT WONTO RICH RECAPITUALLY FOR MYSELF EVEN IF I COULD I'M IF ANY OF THAT MATTERS I HAVEN'T DISCOVERED THAT YET BUT IT'S EMMANG THERE'S IT WAS TAKING UP AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF BAND WITH AND IT'S IT'S IMPRESSIVE AMTHINK I SAID I I YOU KNOW THIS LIKE I AMPUTATED OF A A PHANTOM LIMB WRITER LIKE IT WAS NOT A REAL LIMB BUT IT WAS IT WAS A THIS CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN MY LIFE THAT I'M THAT I IT IS IT'S WERTID IT ACTUALLY RELATES TO THE CONCEPT OF SELF AND IN SURPRISING WAYS BECAUSE I I FELT THERE WAS A PART OF MYSELF THAT EXISTED ON TWITTER AND I YOU KNOW IT I JUST P ERFORMED A A SUICIDE OF THAT YOU THAT' SELF RIHER LIKE THAT'S THAT THIS IS ENDING RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW IT IS NO RESIDUE THIS ONE TO GO BACK AN CHECK THAT JUST IT'S GONE I AND I DID'T EVEN I DIDN'T GO BACK AND LOOK AT MIGHT LIKE WHAT'S INTERESTING TO CONSIDERS THAT YOU O I'VE BEEN ON TWITTER FOR TWELVE YEARS I DON'T KEEP A JOURNAL I'MA TWITTER WHAT IN MY TIME LINE WOULD HAVE BEEN A KIND OF JOURNAL I CULD HAVE GONE BACK TO A SPECIFIC HOUR IN A SPECIFIC DAY AND LOOKED AT WHAT I WAS E PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN INTERESTING RECORD OF JUST WHO I'VE BEEN FOR A DECADE AND I PROBABLY A PRETTY HUMBLING RECORD IF WHO HAVE BEEN FOR A DECATE I'M IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF THINGS A CAPTIVATED MY ATTENTION BUT I DIDN'T EVEN YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T EVEN THINK TO GO BEEN N A STAING OF NEST ALOGICALLY JUST LOOK AT ANY THAT OR SEE IF ANY OF IT WAS WORTH SAVING OR ARCIVING OR THINKI I LIKE JUST JUST DELEAT YOU KNOW AND IT WAS SOM I AND SO MY MY ACTUAL SENSE OF WHO I AM AND MY ENGAGEMENT WITH WITH MY AUDIENCE MY YOU KNOW THE THE WORLD OF PEOPLE WHO COULD POTENTIALLY KNOW ME LIKE WHAT IS IT MEAN TO BE TO HAVE A PLATFORM YOU KNOW WHERE DO I EXIST DITUALLY MY SENSE OF UP ALL OF THAT GOT TRUNCATED IN A IN A WAY THAT I'M IT'S MUCH LESS NOISY I MEAN ITS AMAZING HOW MUCH CAN'T GET FUCKED UP NOW IN MY LIFE IKE IT'S LIKE WITH TWITTER ALMOST ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN IT LIKE IT LIKE THE NEXT TWEET WAS ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MASSIVELY COMPLICATE MY LIFE THERE IS NO ANALOGOUS SPACE FOR ME NOW AND YOU KNOWS IS E WHAT I'M IN A SAYIN YOUR PODCAST WHAT I MYS SAND MY OWN PODCAST WHAT I'M IN RIGHT NEXT THAT'S MUCH MORE I'M YOU

AS HE HAD BEAND SOMEWHAT A PROXIMATE CAUSIT AS HE HAD BEEN ON MY PODCAST AND HEAN HAD ENCOURAGED ME TO DELE TO  TWITTER A CAUSE I HAD BEEN I HAD BEEN A SORT OF IN IN IT REACHING SOME KIND OF I YET A CRIZE'S POINT WITH IT I PRIOR THAT POCAST ANCE I WE TALKED ABOUT IT AND I HADT I HAD RECORDED THAT PODCAST BUT HADN'T RELEASED I  TOL RECORDED THE PODCAST THE DAY BEFORE I WANT UP TO LEADING TWITTER

THE SOURCE OF CREK CREATIVITY AND FOCAS AND ON A REGULAR BISTE DOES REQUIRE THAT ONE HAVE CERTAIN TYPES OF AND IN SOME CASES ZERO INTERACTION WITH CERTAIN PLATFORMS UM THAT MERELY BEING ON A PLATFORM

WAYS WHAT YOU DESCRIBE UM THERES REALLY I THINK STRIKING PARALLELS TO WHAT  TALKING ABOUT ALL ONLY'S LAST HOURS WHICH IS THAT SOMETIMES THE THING THAT FEELS SO UM SO POWERFUL THAT HAS SUCH A GRAVITATIONAL PULL AND THAT WE THINK THIS IS EXPERIENCE THIS IS LIFE AS SJUS THE WAY IT IS ACTUALLY IS AN ILLUSION AND WHEN YOU STEP AWAY FROM IT YOU REALIZE THAT THERE'S THIS WHOLE OTHER DIMENSION OF INTERACTIONS TAY THAT WAS AVAILABLEALL ALONG BUT THAT WE A FOR WHATEVER REASON UM WERE INTERVENING IN BY WAY OF OUR REFLECTSIVE DISTRACTED BEHAVIOR  THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A POET  I WAS A

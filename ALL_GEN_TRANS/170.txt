TO PERSUADE GEORGIA LAWMAKERS TO AGNOR THE WILLOF VOTERS AND APPOINT A NEW SLATE OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE ELECTOURS FAVORABLE TO DONAL TRUMP IN ONE PARTICULARLY BRACE AN EPISODE ED ALSO IN OUTLINES O PLOT INVOLVING ONE OF DONALS FROM'S LAWYERS IN ACCESSING VOTING MACHINES IN RURAL GEORGE COUNTY TO STEAL DATA FROM THE VOTING MACHINE COMPANY'S SUPPOSEDLY ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THE QUESTION THERE IS WHETHER THEY WERE LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE VOTING MACHINES HAD BEEN HACKE OR SOMETHING FULAN COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FANNY WILLIS ANNOUNCED THE CHARGES LAST NIGHT TO DAY MATED ON INFORMATION DEVELOPET BY THAT INVESTIGATION A FLTON COUNTY GRANGURY RETURN A TRU BIAL OF INVICTMENT CHARGING NINETEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH VIOLATIONS OF GEORGE ALO A RITHING FROM A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY TO OVERCURN THE RESULT OF THE TWENTY TWENTIETH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION INVISTATE TTHE INDITEMENT IN CLUTE FORTY ONE FELANY COUNT AN IS NINETY SEVEN PAGES LONG EVERY INDIVINTIAL CHARGE IN THE INDCTMENT IS CHARGE WITH ON COUNT OF VIOLATING GEORGES RACKETEER IN FLUENTH IN CORRUPT ORGANATE VTION ACT FRU PRARTICIPATION IN A CRIMINAL INTIALPRIZE IN FULTON COUNTY GEORGION AND ELSEWHERE TO ACCOMPLISH THE ILEGAL GOAL OF ALOWING DONALD GA TRUMP TO FIETH THE PRESIDENTIAL CHARM OF OFFITH BEGINNING ON JANUARY TWENTIETH TWENTY ONE SO YESTERDAY WAS COMPLETE MASS AT THE GEORGIA COURT HOUSE APPARENTLY THERE WAS A BRIEF BUT MIS SERIOUS INCIDENT IN WHICH THE COUNTY WEBSIGHT PUT UP A LIST OF CRIMINAL CHARGE TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST BEFORE A PRESIDENT WAS WERE TAKEN DOWN PRETTY QUICKLY AND THEN OF COURSE SOMETHING VERY VERY SIMILAR WENT UP VERY LYE LAST NIGHT TRUMPS LEGAL TEAM SAYS THE EVENTS THAT HAVE UNFOLDED TO DAY HAVEBEN SHOCKING AND ABSURD STARTING WITH A LEAK OF THE PRESUMED AND PREMATURE INDICTMENT BEFORE THE WITNESSIS HAD EVEN TESTIFIED OR THE GRANJURERS HAD DELIBERATED AND ANYNG WITH THE DA BEING UNABLE TOALFER ANY EXPLANATION THE INDICTMEN WHICH IS NINETY EIGHT PAGES LONG WHICH CEN OF SMACS OF YOU IN FORTH GRATE ATTEMPTING TO WRIT A VERY LONG FIVE PARAGRAPH ASSAY IN THE HOPE THE TEACHER WOULD GIVE YOU ANA EVEN THOUGH THE ESSER WASN'T VERY GOOD THAT SORT OF HOW THE INDICTMENT READS ITS VERY LONG IT'S VERY DETAILE AND IT SORT OF GOES OVER A LOT OF TERRITORY THT IS ALREADY BEEN TROD THE ACCUSE TRUMP AND HIS ALLEGED CO CONSPIRATORS OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE ACT MANY OF THESE ACTS ARE THINGS HAS SIMPLE AS LIKE RETWEATING THINGS S F YEU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL INDICTMENT IT ACTUALLY SAYS THAT FOR EXAMPLE IT ACCUSES ACT TWENTY EIGHT HONOR ABOUT THE THIRD DAY OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY DONAL JOHN TRUMP MET WITH THE SPEAKER OF THE PENSYLVANIA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE OVAL OFFICE IN DISCUSSED HOLDING A SPECIAL SENTSESSION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA  GENERAL ASSEMBLY THIS WAS AN OVERT ACT IN FURTHERANCE OF THE CONSPIRACY SO MEETINGS ARE APPARENTLY NOW ILLEGALBIT IT HE CALLD BRYANG CAMP HE RETREATED SOMETHING FROM OAYAN EN THTHEIR PEOPLE WHO ARE SUGGESTING THAT THOSE SORTS OF ACTS ARE NOW ILEGAL THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW THIS WORK SO TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE CHARGES WORK YOU FIRST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT RECO IS THE RACETER INFLUENCE IN CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT HOW THAT ACTUALLY WORKS IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL LAW THOS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ORIGINALLY WAS AIMED AT TEM OFFIA AND AGAIN THE THEBASIC PRADICET FOR THE LAW IS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CHARGE PEOPLE WHO ARE UPPER LEVEL GANGSTERS WITH THE CRIMES OF THEIR SUBORDINATES THIS IS WHY RECO WAS PASSED ORIGINALLY YOU'D HAVE A LOW LEVEL HITMAN AND HE GET CHARGED WITH MURDER AND THEN HE REFUSED TO RAT ON HIS BASS AND THERE IS NO WAY TO ACTUALY TRY THE BOSSINS WHAT THEY DID IS THEY STARTED RAPPING TOGETHER THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION AND IN EFFORTS GET THE LOW LEVEL HITMAN TO FLIP ON HIS SUPERIOR AND TO GET THATKITE O FLIP ON THE BOSS THAT WAS THE BASIC IDEA IF YOU INDIT EVERYBODY ALL TOGETHER IT IS EASIER TO FLIP ALL OF THE ASSOCIATES BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL CHARGES THAT SORT OF THE GOAL RIAT YOU CHARGED THE ACCOUNTANT WITH MURDER AND THEREFORE THE ACCOUNT BECAUSE T E THE ACCOUNTIN IS NOW RAPPED IN THE GIANT CONSPIRACY THEACCOUNT DOESN'T WANT GO TO JAIL FOR MURDER THE ACCOUNTIN DOES ONE GOOD JO AT ALL INTO THE ACCOUNT ON FLIPS ON  BOSS THAT' WHAT RACCKET HERING ORIGINALLY WAS IT COMES FROM THE TROM RACKET WHICH MENT AN ORGANIZED THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY ALL THIT REQUIRES THE THE VIOLATION OF RECO AT LEAST ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN THE GEORGEA RECO STATUTE WHICH IS ONE THIS BEING CHARGION IT DOES MAKE A LARGE SCOLE DIFFERENCE BY WAY THISIS A STATE CASE IN NOT A FEDERAL CASE BECAUSE WHON IT MEANS THAT EVEN IF DONAL TRUMP WERE ELECTED PRESSEN HE COULD NOT PARDON HIMSELF OF ANY CHARGE FOR WHICH WHOS SOUND GUILTY IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA HE COULD NOT FREE HIMSELF FROM THAT BY THE WAY ANY ACCUSATION THAT THE GEORGEA GOVERNOR WHOSE REPUBLICAN BRYANG CAMP THE BRYN COUMNP COULD PARDON DONAL TRUMPFOR THIS IS NOT CORRECT THE'S A PANEL IN GEORGIA THAT OULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO SIT AND DECIDE WEATHER OR NOT HO RES PARDON HE ELSO DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO SEMARILY DISMISS DIAS IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA BRAAN COUMP STO ALL OF THE JABBER IT IT IS AMAZING TH EVERYTIME DONAL TRUMKETS IN TROUBLE THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW OTHE REPUBLIC INS HAW AV OR H RESPONSIBILITY TO RESCUE HIM AND VERY OFTEN THAT RESPONSIBILITY DOES NOT THAT IS NOT EVEN WITHIN THEIR POWER I MEAN THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO JANUARY SIX THATS ELF WHEN DONAL TRUMPET SUGGESTED OPENLY THAT MIGHT PENCE HADE THE ABILITY TO SIMPLY TOSS OUT ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE THAT HAD BEEN STATE CERTIFIDEREADY HE DID NOT IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ANY OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE TO BALE DONALD TRUMP OUT WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE LEGAL POWER TO DO SO THEY THE LEGAL POWER TO DO SO LEASE YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT BUT BRAN CAMP DOES NEVEN HAVE THAT LEGAL POWER IN ANYWAY ANYWAYS WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE REGO ACT WHICH IS VERY VERY SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL REGAL ACT THE WAY THAT RACATEURING BASICALLY WORKS IS RACETEERING IS BROADLY TO FIME AS REQUIRING AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THE ACTS OF RACCETEERING ACTIVITY COMMITTED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF EACH OTHER AND IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THERE BE A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY IN FURTHERANCE OF A CRIME CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY AN FURTHERANCE OF A CRIME LA GAN WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT LET SAY YOU AND I WE DECIDE THAT WERE GN CONSPIRE TO GO TO THE WALMARK TOGETHER NOT A CRIME BECAUSE THAT'S CONSPIRACY WITHOUT ACTUAL FURTHERANCE OF A CRIME HE UNITE AS HI REGN TA ROB A BANK TOGETHER THAT MEANS THAT IF WE GO TO LALMART TO BUY A SHOT GUME ONLE BUY THE SHOT GUN AT THE LOGAL WALMART OR SOMETHING NORMALLY TAT WOUDN BE ILLEGAL A IT BECOMES A LEGAL BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE OW PLANNING TO USE THAT SHOT GUN IN THE ROBBING OF THE BANK SO MANY OF THE ACTS THAT TRUMP AND HIS ASSOCIATES ARE BEING ACCUSED OUT OUR ACTS CORNC IN FURTHERANCE OF THE CRIME SO THE REAL QUESTION IN THIS CASE IS NOT WHETHER DONAL TRUMP DID ALL THE THINGSE THAT THE INCICTEMENT ELLEGES MOST OF THT IS UNDISPUTED THE REAL QUESTION IN THIS CASE IS WETHER IT WAS IN FURTHERANCE OF A CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ANOTHER WORDS IS IT A CRIMINAL ACTIVITY FOR DONAL TRUMP TO PURSUE A BUNCH OF LEGAL MEANS TO FORSTALL HIS ELECTION LOSS IS THAT STUFFY LEGAL NOW IF YOU'AD GOTTENTOGETHER MUNCHER'S FRIENDS AND HE SAID LET'S ACTUALLY OVERTHROW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENE TIUU LOK ILLEGAL BUT THEN JACKSMITH WOULD BE CHARGING THAT OF THE FEDERAL LEVEL RIGHT HE BE CHARGING HIM WITH ACTUAL INSURRECTION WHICH HE DID NOT HE WOUD ALSO BE CHARGING HIM WITH INCIEMENT OF ARIET WHICH HE DID NOT WHEN IT COMES TO GEORGIA THE ACCUSATION IS THE DONAL TRUMP ESSENTIALLY ONE TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE GEORGIA ELECTION THROUGH ILLEGAL MEANS AND WHO'SE PRESSURING PEOPLE TO DO IT THROUGH ILLEGAL MEANS AND IS IT PRETTY SERIOUS CHARGE AGAIN I THINK THAT IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THIS COUL BE PROVED IN CORPORATES ALSO HAPPENING AN ELANTA SO JUST LIKE THE WASHINGTON BE SEE CASE THIS MEANS THAT YOU HAVE A LOGAL JURY THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE FREMLY TO PRESEDENT TRUMP NOW AS I SAY I THINK IN TO DOUBTFUL CHARGE BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE SOME THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING CHARGED HERE AND SOME THE PEOPAL BEING CHARGE ARE SOME OF THE QUONNCOT FALSE ELECTORS RIHT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO SIGNED IN A A A DOCUMENT SAYING THAT THEY WERE THE DULY ELECTED ELECTORS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA WHEN THEY WERE NOT BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM A DOUBT WHICH IS THAT IFWEU GO ALL THEWAY BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY FOR EXAMPLE HOY DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY DID THE SAME THING HOWY YOU BELIEV OURE OT WAS A VERY SORT OF RAZERS EDGE STATE BETWEEN PUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY ELECTION SO DEMOCRATS CREATED AND ALTERNATIVE SLATE OF ELECTORS WHO SIGNED A DOCUMENT CLAIMING THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY THE ALTERNATIVE SLATEIV ELECTORS THAT WAS NOT ILLEGAL AT THE TIME SO IF YOU SIGN ON TO A DOCUMENT SAYING I'M A MEMBER OF THE DULY ELECTED SLATE OF ELECTORS AND THEN THE STATE REJECTS THAT IS THAT ILLEGAL IF YOU TAKE BAD LEGAL ADVICE T IS THAT ILLEGAL BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEN MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW BEING INDICTED AR DONAL TRUMP'S LAWYERS AND SO THE IDEA HERE IS THE DONNAL TRUM WOULD HAVE TO SHOW IT WOUD HAVE TO BE SHOWN THE DONAL TRUMP KNEW FOR A FACT THAT HE LOST THE GEORGIA ELECTION THEN HE THEN PURSUD A BUNCH OF MEANS IN ORDER TO OVERTURN THAT ELECTIONS YOU COME BACK TO THE SAME THING THT YOU HAVE N THE DRACKSINTHE FEDERAL CASE WHICH HAS WHAT DID DONAL TRUM KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT DO YOU THINK THAT HE ACTIVELY BELIEVE THAT HE WON THE GEORGIA ELECTION AND HO IS PURSUING A BUNCH OF LEGAL STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT WIN OR DIT HE KNOW THAT HE LOST AND HE DIDN'T CARE AND BECAUSE HE KNEW HE LOST WHOS ATTEMPTING TO OVERTHROW THE ELECTION AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE OPEN QUESTION NOW DONAL TRUMP HIS DONE HIMSELF NO FAVORS ALONG THESE LINES AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS DONAL TRUM ACTIVELY REACH WE DIDN'NT ARTICLE AFTER DAVID PURDUE WHO LOST IN A SENATE RACE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE LARGELY COSDONAL TRUMP TOLD OUV BY NOT TOVOAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEN RUN OFF AFTER HE LOST DONAL TRUMP TRID TO PROP HIM UP TO RUN AGAINS SPRANG COM FOR GOVERNOR BECAUSE BRAN CAMP DID NOT GO ALONG WITH DONAL TRUMPS  GEORGIA SHENAN AGAINS DAVID PRET OU GOT IS ASKEC BY LIC FIFTY POINTS IN THE PRIMARY AGAINST BRYIN CAM AND DONAL TRUMP THEN PROCEEDED TO TWEE OUT AN ARTICLE SUGGESTING THAT DAVID PRUDUE HAD LOST BECAUS O VOTOR FRAUD SO IT AGAIN THE CASE THAT FANNY WILLIS AND COMPANY ARE GOING TO MAKE JUST TO BE TOTALLY LEGALLY FAIR HERE THE CASE THERE GOING TO A TEMP TO MAKES THE DONAL TRUMP DUS AN ACTUALLY CARE AT ALL WHETHER HE WINS OR LOSES AN ELECTION HEIS GOING TO CLAIM THAT HE WON AND THEN HE IS GOING TO ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE ILEGITIMATE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION BUT DONAL TRUMP ALSO COULD LEGITIMATELY BELIEVE THAT HE WON THE GEORGIA ELECTION EVEN IF THAT'S NOT TRUE AND BY THE WAY IIT IS NOT TRUE THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF GEORGA HAS ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED TO PRY OUT INFORMATION FROM TRUE THE BOAT WHICH IS THE ORGANIZATION BEHIND TWO THOUSAND MULES AND TOM TH TRUTHVOT HAS REFUSE TO TURN OVER THE IN FORMATION THEY STAY SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF WIDESPREAD VOTOR FRAUD IN THE STATE OF GEORGI AB THAT DOESN'T MATTER THE REAL QUESTION IS INTENT IS IT A CRIMNAL ACT TO LISTEN'S BAD LEGAL ADVICE IS IT A CRIMINAL ACT TO CALL UP THE GEORGIA' SECRETARY STATE ANS AV WANT YOU TO FIND ME ELEVEN THOUS AND IGHT HUNDRED SEVENY BOATS IS THAT A THING THAT IS CRIMINAL OR 'S THAT JUST YOU BENG AN IDIOT WRIGHT YOU BEING AN IDIOT NOT A CRIME A CONSPIRACY TO BE AN IDIOT ALSO NOT A CRIME WELL GET TO MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST

JURISTICTION AT CAN ALSO BE TRUE THAT DONAL TRUMP IS BEING TARGEED BY FANNY WILLIS IN HIGHLY POLITICAL FASHION IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING AS JACKSMITH GOING AFTER HIM IN WASHINGTON D C ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT THE GEORGE CASE JOSTSBASED ON STATUTE IS STRONGER THEN THE WASHINGTON D C CASE THE WASHINGTON D C CASE HAS A BUNCH OF TWISTING AND TURNING TO TRY TO FIT WHAT DONAL TRUMP DID INTO A BUNCH OF STATUTES TOT DON'T QUITE FIT THIS ONE YOU CAN ALLEAS MAKE THE ARGUMENT LEGALLY SPEAKING THET DONALTRUMP FITS WITHIN THE PERVIEW OF THE STATUTES IN A WAY THAT THAT HE DOESN'T IN SORT OF THE DC CASE BUT WITH ALL THAT' SAID WHY IS IT THAT FOUR CASES HAVE NOW COME DOWN IN FIVE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION WHY THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BUT SUSPICIOUS I YET YOU AVE FOUR MAJOR CRIMINAL CASES THAT HAE COME DOWN AND LAST FIVE MENCE AGAINST THE LEADING REPUBLICAN CONTENDOR FOR THE PRESIDENCY BELTS AN AWFUL LOTLIC ELECTION INTERFERENCE JUST TO ANY OUTSIDE OBSERVER OBVIOUSLY AS I SAY THIS THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS EXTREMELY BROAD FANNY WILLIS AS NOW GIVEN DONAL TRUMP A DEADLINE TO TURN HIMSELF IN AND PEOPLE AT THE COURT HAS MEAN TOL POLITICAL THIS IS PEOPLE AT THE COURTHOUSE ARDY SANUS GINTO A MUG SHOT WHICH WILL EASILY BE THE MOST TRAFFIC PHOTO IN HUMAN HISTORY YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TONAL TRUMPLE SMILE FOR THE PHOTO BECAUSE WHEN YOU SMILE FOR YOUR MOG SHOT YOU LAT COOL AND DONAL TRUM KNOWS THAT HERE IS A HERE'S FANNUWELLIS EXPLAINING THE DEADLINE Y IN GIVING ME THE FINTIFT THE OPPORTUNITY TWO BOLLY TATLEAST TO WINDER YOLL LATER THEN NON ON FIDAY THE TWENTY FIFT DAY OF AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY THREE YAY SO DONALTRUMPS GOING TO HAVE TO TURN HIMSELF IN PROBABLY NEXT WEEK IT IS WORTH WHILE NOTING HERE THAT DONAL TRUM IS GOING TO HAVE ONE DOFENCE WHICH IS THE GRAND JURY WAS ESSENTIALLY PRESET BAT THE BIAS IN THE GRAND JURY WAS ESSENTIALLY PRESET YOU'LL RECALL THT THERE WAS A CRAZY LADY WHO IS THE FOUR PERSON OF THE GRAND JURY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE FER NAME WAS EMILY CORS AND A SHO WAS THE WICH I BELIEVE WHO THEN WENT ON A NATIONAL MEDIATE TOURE TALKING ABOUT THE GRAND JRY WORKINGS AND WAS EXTREMELY WEIRD SO DONAL TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM IS GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING TO HANG THEIR HAT ON HERE HERE IS A HERE'S A FLASHBACK OF EMILY CORS THE GRAND JURY FOUR PERSON WHO AGAIN IS A WEIRDO PERSONALLY A REN EG  OFF O  A JURY DUTY MAN IT'S THE PLACE WHERE TWELVE PEOPLE TOO DUM TO GET OUT A JURY DUTY GET THE DESIDE YOUR FATE SO I YET DONAL TRUMPS TEAM IS GING TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT ALL OF THAT AS WELL ILL GET TO MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS CRAZY RIGHT NOW AND YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO JUST LIKE CALM DOWN AND TAKE BUT THE WAY THAT I DO THAT IS THREE TIMES O DAY EY ACCORDING TO JEWISH RICUAL I HAVE TO PRAY BUT IF YOU ARE NOT NORTHODOX YO AND YOU R LOOKING FOR

EMOTIONAL WELL BEING TRY HALLOW FOR THREE MONTHS FREE AT HALLODOT COMSLASH OR PURO THATS HALLO DOT COM SLASH CHIPPIRO O CASE SO AS I SAY THIS CRIMINAL INDICTMENT HERE THE PEOPLE ARE NAMED TRUMP RUDIJULIANI JOHN EASTMAN WHO IS LAWYER MARK MEADOWS WHO IS THE CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN HISBRO WHO IS A ONE OF HIS LAWYERS AS WELL JEFFREY CLARK WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE D O JA JENA ALIS ONE OF HIS LAWYERS AND THEN THERE A BUNCH OF MORE LOCAL OFFICIALS INCLUDING A BUNCH PEOPLE WHO SIGNED ON TO THE ALTERNATIVE ALECTOR SCHEME CAKE NOP HOW IS THIS GUN TOF PLAY OUT IS VERY LIKELY THAT HE FACES  APPARENTLY HE FACES THIRTEEN CHARGES AND UP TO SEVENTY ONE YEARS IN JAIL AN HE HEIS NOW FACING WE ARE TALKING THIRTEEN CHARGES THERE HE SACING I BELIEVE FOURTEEN CHARGES IN WASHINGTON YOU SEE HE'S FACING A BEBBY OF CHARGES IN THE CLASSFI DOCCUMENT'S CASE SO AIN'T TRUMP IS IN SERIOUS JUPPARD OF GOING JAIL N AS WE SAY BECAUSE THIS IS A STATE CASE HE CANNOT PARDON HIMSELF SO THE ARGUMENT THAT DONAL TRUMP MUST BE ELECTED PRECEDENTS THAT HE CAN ESCAPE JAIL WHICH IS AN ARGUMENT I'M SEEING MADE RIGHT NOW I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WORKS I DON'T SEE EXACTLY HOW THAT ARGUMENT IS EVEN OPERATIVE IN TURMS OF WHICH OF THESE CASES POSES THE LARGEST SCALE LEGAL THREAT TO DONAL TRUMP THIS IS THE CASE THAT OBVIOUSLY POSES THE LARGER SCAL LEGAL THRATS DONAL TRUMP THE REASON BEING IT IS BROAD IT IS ALL INCOMPASSING AT ALLOWS FANNY WILLIS TO TELL THIS OVER ARKING STORY LINKING TOGETHER HIS ACTIVITIES IN PENNSYLVANIA AND HIS ACTIVITIES IN WASHINGTON HE SEE AND HIS ACTIVITIES IN GEORGIA IN THIS BROAD BASE CONSPIRACY IN WHICH SHE CAN CONNECT TO ALL OF THESE DOTS BUT SMART O HER TO CHARGE UNDER THE REKO ACT TO TO BE SIMPLE ABOUT THE CIT  IS NOT A STUPID CHARGE FOR HER TO DO THIS DON YOU SAY THAT IT'S CORRUPT YO CAN SAY THAT IT IS POLITIALY MODIVATE I THN THERE SOME TRUTH TO THAT IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE CASE THAT JUST FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE WHAT SHE'S DOING HERE IS NOT UNINTELLIGENT WHAT SHE'S DOING HERE IS A WEAPON DESIN TO TAKE DOWN TRUMP NO CAU AND NOTE NO QUESTION TRUMP CALLS HER AN OUT OF CONTROL IN VERY CORRUPT DISTRICT ATTORNEY HE DECLARES THE CHARGES ARE PART OF A WHITCH HUNT THE CASE AGAIN IS THE FOURTH TARGANING TRUMP JUST THIS YEAR ALONE THE THE THIS CASE PROBABLY WILL RUN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE ELECTION BECAUSE IT IS VERY LARGE SCOLL NOW SHE HAS SAYS AND THIS THIS PART THIS PARTYS CRAZY SHE SAYS SHUUNTS TO TRY ALL OF THE DEFENDENCE AT ONCE LI PUT THEM ALL IN A ROOM TOGETHER AND TRY THEM AT ONCE SORTR LIKE THAT SCENE WHERE HARVEY DENT TRIES EVERYBODY ALL TOGETHER IN THE DARK NIGHT YOU KNOW THAT YOUREMEMBER THAT SEEME HE BRINGS IN ALL OF THE CORRUP MOB STARS AND PUT THEME ALL IN HER ROOM TOGETHER AND ALL THEIR LAWYERS ARE PROTESTING AND ALL O THE REST OF THUS AND HE DOESN'T THROW SCARE INTO THEM BAST PART OF IT AN WHAT REGOES DESIGNE TO DO AS I SUGGESTED EARLIER IS TO GET THE ACCOUNT TO FLIP ON HE HITMAN WHO FLIPS ON THE HEADMAN MY PART OF THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO GET PEOPLE WHO ARE A ROUND TRUMP TO FLIP ON TRUMP TO AVOID CRIMINAL CHARGES SO WHEN IS THIS EXTRICAN TN TAKE PLACE THAT IS STILL UP IN THE AIR WILLIS DID NOT SAY WHETHER SHE IS SPOKEN WITH SPECIAL PROSCUTOR JACKSMITH AT THIS PLOINT WHICH PROBABLY MEANS THAT SHE HAS SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T CARE WHETHER THIS GOES FIRST OR LAST WHICH MEANS THAT IT WILL GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE ELECTION WITHOUT IT OUT TRUMP WROTE ON TRUTH SOSIAL SO THE WHICH UN CONTINUES NINETEEN PEOPLE INDICHTED TO NIGHT INCLUDIG THE FORM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ME  BY AN OUT OF E CONTROLL AND VERY CORRUPT DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO CAMPAIGN AND RAISED MONEY ON I WILL GET TRUMP AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE INDICTMENT DOCUMENTS PUT OUT TO DAY LONG BEFORE THE GRAND JURY EVEN BOTED AND THEN QUICKLY WITHDRAWN SOUNDS RIG TO ME WHY DIDN'T THEY INDITE TWO POINT FIVE YEARS AGO BECAUSETHEY WANT TO DO RIGHT IN THE MDDLE OF MY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN WHICH HUNT AND AGAIN THAT MAY VERY WELL BE THE CASE THAT DOES NOT MEAN HE IS NOT IN LEGAL DANGER TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT ONCE AS ALWAYS AS ALWAYS HE CAN BE INLEGAL DANGER IT CAN BE A WITCH HUNT IT CAN BE AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE HIM OUT IN THE ELECTION THE REAL QUESTION FOR A PUBLICANS IS WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO GO LONG WITH THE BATE HERE N THE OBVIOUS BATE IS NOMINATE TRUMP SAID HE CAN TAKE HIS REVENGE AS HI SAID BEFORE I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WORKED EVEN LEGALLY SPEAKING IF HE GOES TO JAIL IN GEORGIA HE WILL STILL BE IN JAIL IN GEORGIA AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THERE'S THE CIVIL SUIT THATAS FILED AGAINST DONAL AGAINST BILL CLINTON WHEN HE AS PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES BY POLOJONES AT WENT FORWARD IT'S WHY THE MONICAL LINSKY SCANDAL HAPPEN WE'VE NEVER HAD A CASE WHERE A STATE CRIMINAL TRARGE AS FILED AGAINST THE SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OW DO YOU KNOWHW TAT WOULD WORK I'M NOT URE ANYBODY KNOWS HOW THAT WOULD WORK WHAT SAY THAT YOU GET HIT WITH A MURDER CHARGE AND YOU RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY TRUM JAIL ARE YOU AUTOMATICALLY FREED FROM JAIL ON THEMURDER CHARGE WY GET LET SAY THE TED CENNEDY NA SHE GOT AN HIT WITH A MURDER CHARGE OR AT LEAST A MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES HE SHOULD HAVEBEN IN THE KISMARYJO CAPACNA IN MASSACHUSETTS AND THEN HE CWONTINUE TO SERVE IN THE UNITED STATE SENATE PRESUMABLY HE STILL TO GONE TO JAIL SO I DON'T NOW HINY OTHERS WORK CAN MUCH HURE ANYBODY KNOWS HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS GEORGIA REPRESENTS PROBABLYTHE MOST SERIOUS THREAT TO TRUMPS LIBERTY ACCORDING TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LEGAL ANALISTS INCLUDING ANY MACARTHY IT'S IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY AT THIS POINT AS I  SAY IIT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THE TRUMP ESCAPES ALL LEGAL CONSEQUENCE FOR ALL OF THESE CHARGES II AM NOT SURE HOW HE ESCAPES WHATCS CAN A HAPPEN HIM IN WASHINGTON SEE OR GEORGIA AND WH N WE SAY THAT IT'S OUTRAGEOUS IT IS IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE GLASS IS NOW BEEN BROKEN SO WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE NEXT IS WHAT TRULY WHAT WERE ABOUT TO SEE NEXT IS REPUBLICAN TO AS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY STAR TO INDITE PEOPLE LIKE JOBIDON FOUR THINGS LIKE RACKET TEERING AND CORRUPTION AS RICES PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ONCE THE GLASS HAS BEN BROKEN IT CANNOT BE UNBROKEN THE GLASS IS NOW BEEN BROKEN THE PREDICTABLE RESULT OF THIS IS NOT THE DONAL FROM CANSELECTED PRESIDENT THE PREDICTABLE RESULT OF THIS IS THAT LAWFAR NOW BE COMES THE WAY THE POLITICAL OPPONENTS GO AFTER EACH OTHER ON THE REGULAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY REALLY DANGEROUS THING REMEMBER DONALTRUM WHO'SE CON SIDER WILDLY OUT OFTH BOUND O PROPRIETY WHEN DONALS FROM SAID TO HILERY CLINTON THAT FUSELECTED PRESIDEN ENT SHE WOULD BE IN JAIL YOU REMEMBER HE SAID THE TURING IN O BATE SHE SAID WELL WHAT WOULD YOU EVEN DO IF YOUR PRESDEN AT COVATER PRESINTENT YOU BE IN JAIL AND THEN HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT INT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE MYSELF INCLUDED THOUGHT WELL THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD WE AFTURE DON'T WANT PEOPLE PERSECUTING THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS WHEN THAT WOULD CLEARLY HAVE DEMOCRATS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FROM MANHATTON TOU NOW GEORGIA TO WASHINGTON TU SEE TO FLORIDA GOING AFTER THEI'RE POLITICAL OPPONENTS THAT IS NOT A BELL THAT CAN BE UNWRUNG GET READY FOR REPUBLICANS TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING AS SOON AS THEY HAVE THE POWER AND THE GROUNDS TO DO SO THAT ISWHRE WE STANDIS COUNTRYES THE THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET WORSE NOT BETTER ALL THOSE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT WHO THING THAT THIS SORT OF DIT THIS IS RESTORING RULE OF LAW AND ALL THE NONSENSE NONSENSE ALL THIS IS GOING TO DO IS GOING TO ACHIEVE A REASE TO THE BOTTOM BECAUSE AGAIN ONCE THE LAW CAN BE USED AS A WEAPON DIRECTLY AGAINST YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS WHY EXACTLY WHICH YOU ALLOW THE OTHER SIDE TO USE THAT WEAPON AND TO AVOID CULPABILITY FOR THEIR USE OF THAT WEAPON IT'S HARD TO SEE EXACTLY HOW THIS DOESN'T AND POORLY FOR PETTY MUCH EVERYBODY WILL GET TO MORE ON THIS IN ONE SECOND FIRSTS EVERYONE KNOWS HOW LET MY HELIC MATTRESS DID YOU KNOW THAT JUST LAUNCH THEIR NEWEST MOST HIGHT AND COLLECTION THE HELICKS ELET HULIK IS

WAS SUPPOSEDLY A BIG CONTRAST WITH DONAL TRUMP IF YOULOOK AT THE LATEST POLES FROM GALLOP JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION THEY LOOKED AT CHARACTER DIMENSIONS FORTHY VARIEUS CANDIDATES AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT SIXTY SIX PER CENT OF AMERICAN VOTERS THOUGHT THAT JOBIDE NOTE WAS LIKABLE AS POST TO THIRTY SIX PER CENT WITHOUT THE DON TRUMP WAS LIKEABLE FIFTY TWO PER CENT THOUGHT THAT JOBIDE WAS TRUSTWORTHY IS POST TO FORTY PER CENT WITHOUT THE TRUMP WAS HONEST AND TRUSTWORTHY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY FIFTY FOUR PER CENT OF AMERICAN SAID THAT JOBID AND CARED ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THEM AS UPPOST ONLY FORTY FIVE PERCENT WHO SAID THE DONAL TRUMP CARED ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THEN WILL THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE LIE ABOUT JOBINE HE IS NOT ONEST AN TRUSTWORTHY IS NOT PARTICULAR LIKABLE AND HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ANY ONE OUTSIDE OF HIS IMMEDIATE CIRCLE THIS IS WHY EVERYBODY WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE BIDING FAMILY IS RICH IF YOU RE INSIDE THE CIRCLE HE MAKES YOU RICH IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU TAND YOUAS PUT THIS ON DISPLAY A MULTIPLICITY OF TIMES FROM AFGANNISTAND TO MOST RECENTLY THIS LAHINOTE FIRE THAT KILLED AT LEAST A HUNDRED  PEOPLE SO ACCORDING TO BLOOMBURG THIS MALLI FIRE IS THE

EFFORTS THAT THATH TOLD IS DEFINITELY GOING TO GO UP SO WHAT IS JOBIDAN DOING DURING ALL OF THIS NOW REMEMBER WE HAVE A HISTORY IN THE UNITED STATES OF HOLDING THE PRESEDENTS OF THE UNITEDSTATES OR EVEN SENATORS FROM A GIVEN STATE ACCOUNTABLE FOR NATURAL DISASTERS WHERE THEY ARE NOT REALLY HAND OMIC RIGHT IN THEMIDDLE OF IT JUST IN FALL YOU'LL RECALL OF COURSE WHEN JEORGE STOBY BUSH WAS

ONCE AGAIN ASSOCIATING WITH THOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO FLATTER HIM BUT IS THAT A GREAT WAY TO STAFF IS THAT A GREAT WAY TO RUN A CAMPAIGN I HAVE SOME DOUBTS OU CA MEANWHILE THE CRAZIEST JUDICIAL RULING OF THE DAY ACCORDING TO THE YOUR TIMES A GRUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN MONTANA WHEN A LANDMARK LOST UT ON MONDAY WHEN A JUDGE RULE THAT THE STATES FAILURE TO CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN A PROVING A FOSSIL FEEL PROJECTS WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE DECISION IN THE SUIT HELD VERS'S MONTANA COMING DURING SUMMER OF RECORD HEAT ANS ELYWILE AFFAIRS MARKS OF VICTORY IN THE EXPANDING FIGHT AGAINST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR OILED GAS AND COAL THE BURNING OF WHICH HAS RAPIDLY WARMED THE PLANET JULIA OLLSON THE FOUNDER OF OUR CHILDRENAS TRUSTS WHICH IS A LEGAL MON PROPIT GROUP THAT BROUGHT THE CASE I'M BEHALF OF MINERS SAID QUOTE AS FIRES RAGE IN THE WLEST FUEL BY FOSSIL FEEL PILLUTION TO DAY'S RULING AN MONTAN IS A GAME CHANGER THE MARKS OF TURNING POINT IN THIS GENERATION'S EFFORS TO SAVE THE PLANET THE RULING MEANS THAT MONTANA MUST CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO A PROVE OR TO RENEW FOSSIL FEEL PROJECTS NOW IT'S AN OBSURD RULING BECAUSE NORMALLY IN ORDER TO SUE YOU HAVE TO HAVE STANDING HE STANDING MEANS THAT YOU ARE DAMAGE BY THE THING AND IT'S DON ENOUGH TO HAVE GENERAL STANDING IF YOU DON'T YEURE LIKE A LAW AND THE LAW DAMAGES YOU YOU CAN'T JUST SUE THEY'S DON GENERAL STANDING THT YOU DON'T LIKE THE LAW FOR EXAMPLE THE INCREASED TAXAS YOUR PERSON WHO PAYS TAXES THAT DISD NT GIVE YOU STANMDING TO SUE THAT'S A POLITICAL QUESTION HA NORDOUT STANDING IT'S GOT  GI HATE YOU WITH MY CAR NOW YOU HAVE STANDING TO SU ME BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE COURT SUGGESTED THAT THE MENTAL ANGUISH UNDERGONE BY CHILDREN BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE GAVE THEM STANDING TO SUE MONTANA FOR NOT CONSIDERING CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN DETERMINANG WHETHER OR NOT TO DRILL FOR OIL EMILY FLOWER SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE ETTERNEY GENERAL SAID THE RULING'S OBSUR NOT SURPRISING FROM A J G TO LET THE PLANTIVES TURNING PUT ON A WEEK LONG TAX PAR FUND AN PUBLICITYS ON THOSE SUPPOSED TO BE A TRIAL IT'S HA BAZAR BAZAR CASE FOR SURE MICHAEL BURGER WHOH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SATAN CENTER FOR CLIMATE CHANGELITIGATION O COLUMBIA SAD QUOTE THIS WAS CLIMATE SCIENCE ON TRIAL AND WHAT THE CUORT IS FOUND IS MATTER OFACTS THAT THE SCIENCE IS RIGHTS D NOW WE HAVE COURTS TO JUSTING THE SCIENCE IS RIGHT AND BY THE SCIENCE IS RIGHT THAT MEANS THAT IF MONTANNA DRILLS FOR OIL THEN INDUBITABLY THIS IS GOING TO CREATE MASSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT OLTILLIAR GIDS BECAUSE NOW IT IS THE JOB OF COURTZ PRESUMABLY SEDECIDE THE SCIENCE PRETTY INCREDIBLE RULING SO FIRST OF ALL NOT THE PURBIEW OF COURSE ACTUALLY AND IU OUHT ELSE IS NOTS PURVUOF CORTZ TO SIMPLY GIVE STANDING TO PLINTUS WHO DON'T HAVE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE THE MONTANIC CASE REVOLVED AROUND LANGUAGE IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION THE GUARANTIES RESIDENT THE RIGHT TO A CLEAN AND HELPFUL ENVIRONMENT AND STIPULATES THE STATEN INDIVIDUALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING AN IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS BUT THE RIGHT TO CLEAN AND HELPFUL ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO A BALANCING ROUTINE AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS WORTH WHILE FOR THE CITIZENS TO SAY DRILL SO NOW APPARENTLY ALL THSE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN AS SU AND STATES RANGEING FROM HOY TO UTA TO VIRGINIA IS THE FIRST KIND OF CASE LIKE THIS TO GO TO TRIAL IN THE UNITED STATES THE STATE CONTENDED TAT MONTANIS MISSIONS ARE MUNISCHULE WHEN COMPARED AGAINST THE REST OF THE GLOBES THE PLANT TIFS ARGUE THE STATE HAS TO DO MORE TO CONSIDER HOW OMISSIONS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO DROUT WILD FIRES ANDOTHER GROWING RISKS THAT IT'S AN INSANE RULING OBVIOUSLY MANY OF THE YOUNGSTERS TESTIFY IN ABOUT THE EFFECTS THEY HAD WITNEST SO NOW WE HAVE FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS TESTIFYING ABOUT HOW THEY SAW THA IT WAS REALLY HOT OUTSIDE AND THIS IS NOW THE GROUND TO SHUT DOWN DRILLING IN TE STATE OF MONTANNA THANKS TO THIS IDIOT JUDGE NOT I'VE A QUESTION I'VE QUESTION WHY IS IT EXACTLY THAT YOUNG PEOPLE COULD NOT SU WO STOP FOR EXAMPLE PRETTY MUCH EVERY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM CAS THE I'LL TAKE ON DEBT REALLY WHY NOT WHY WHY DON'T THEY SAY THAT THE  GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO CANNOT VOTE ARE NOT BURDEN WIT THE COST OF POLICIES THT ARE UNDERTAKEN NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE OT A VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION FOR EXAMPLE YOU THE THEORATICALLY MAKE A CRAZY ARGUMENT THUT THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUS WHICH SAYS THAT EVERY CITIZEN INTIDLED TO EQUAL PROTECTION OF T E LAW SHOULD PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO VOTE YET IN THEIR INTERESTS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YO SADDLE THE CONTRY WITH TATE THIRTY TWO SHRILLION DOLLARS TO NATIONAL DEBT THAT'S CON HIT MY KIDS AND MY KIDS KIDS SO SHOULDN'T THE ABE BE ABLE TO SU AND TAD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T BEABLE TO PASS LAWS THAT RAISE THAT THAT IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO YOU KNOW TACTUALLY SPEND MONEY THET MAY BE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOVE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SHULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT THING IS THAT THET DIRECTION THT WERE GOING TO NOW HAVE JUDGES GOING I HIGHLY DOCT THE LEFT ONCE TO GO DOWN THIS THIS PATH FIRST O ALLS CAN N BSTRUCT DOWN AT THE SPRING POR LEVEL BEGAS OBVIOUSLY SPECIOUS AND STUPID BUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS HOW THE LFT WITH LOVE COURTZ TO RULE JUST DEMONSTRATES ONCE AGAIN THE LEFT HAS NO LIMITSWHEN IT COMES TO POWER THEY TRULY DON'T THE'LL SUGGEST THAT THE RIGHT IS POWER HUNGRY WHEN THE SUPREME COURT SAYS WE WILL NOT STEP INTO THE ABORTION OF ATE WE'LL INSTED KICKET BACK TO THE STATE IN FEDERAL LEVEL THAT APPARENTLY IS AN OGREGIOUS USURPATION OF POWER BY THE SUPREME COURT BUT IT IS A PROTECTION OF RIGHTS WHEN A LOCAL JODGE SAYS THAN AN ENTIRE STATE NOW HAS TO STOP DRILLING BHECAUSE MUNCH OF FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE MAD WHICH IS LITERALLY WITH THIS DECISION IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE STUFF WELL ALL OF THE SCIETY INTO A REALY FASCINATING PIECE BY DAVID BROOKSTODAY OVER THE ATLANTIC IS CALLED HOW AMERICA GOT MEAN HERE'S WHAT DAVEBROK SAYS SAYS OVER

WHY AMERICANS HOD BECOME SADIN ALIENATED AND ROUDE I BELIEVE XULS OF THE SIMPLES WE INHABIT A SOCIETY IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER TRAINED AND HOW TO TREAT OTHERS WITH KINDNESS AND CONSIDERATION OUR SOCITIES BECOME ONE IN WHICH PEOPLE FEEL LICENS TO GIVE THEIR SELFISHNESS FREE RAIN THE STORY I'M GOING T TELLS ABOUT MORALS AND A HELTHY SOCIETY WEB OF INSTITUTIONS FAMILY SCHOOLS RELIGIOU SCRIPTS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WORKPLACES HELPS FORM PEOPLE INTO KIND AND RESPONSIBL CITIZENS THE SORT O PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP FOR ONE ANOTHER WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THAT'S TERRIBLE AT MORAL FORMATION HE SAYS THE MORAL FORMATION COMPRISES THREE THINGS FIRST HELPING PEOPLE TO LEARN TO RESTRAIN THEIR SELFISHNESS HE SAYS THAT AMERICA USED TO BE GOO O THI SECOND TEACHING BASIC SOCIAL AND ETHICAL SKILLS AND THIRD HELPING PEOPLE FIND A PURPOSE IN LIFE NOW HE'S RIGHT ABOUT ALL OF THIS BUT HE IS MISSING WY EXACTLY ALL OF THIS FELL APART NOW PART OF IT WAS THE INCREASING ATIMIZATION OF AMERICAN SOCIETY  WITH TALKED ABOUT AND THIS TIES BACK INTO THE DECLINE OF CHURCH ATTENDANTS FOR EXAMPLE IT TIES BACK INTO THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA NOW THE THE SORT OF MOVE TOWARD INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION AS OPPOSED TO A COMMUNAL A COMMUNAL OBLIGATION THAT LED TO THIS SORT OF BREAK DOWN OBVIOUSLY HE SAYS SCHOOLS BEGAN TO ABANDON MORAL FORMATION IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND FIFTIES HE SAS THE POST OR PERIOD SAW SIMILAR CHANGES AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL HE SAYS QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE HAD LIVEIGOOD LIFE LOST ALL PURCHASE IT'S FERE AFTER FEARE PEOPLE DECIDED THAT MORAL REASONING WAS NOT REALLY RELEMANT PSYCHOLOGIS PERFOU G GRUW ESPECIUALLY IN FAMILY AND EDUCATIONAL MATTERS IT' VO CABULARY FROMING VIRTUALLY ALL PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THE MORAL LIFE OF CHILDREN ITS SO BE THE PRIVATIZING MORALITY THE THE ATTEMPT TO GET AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF A COMMON GOOD HE SAYS THE MORAL INSTINCTS HERE ARE FALLING INTO A PATTERN THAT PHILOSOPHER ALISETHEIR MACKANTIRE ALLED EMOTIVISM WHATEVER FEEL GOOD FEELS GOOD TO ME IS MORAL WHICH OF COURSE WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS MOST LUST WHO NOTICE THE PROSS OF DE MORALIZATION AS IT WAS OCCURRING THOGHT A BLAND MORAL RELATTI THISM AND EMPTY CONSUMERS WOULD BE THE RESULT YOU DO YOU AND ALL TO ME THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED JONATHAN HIGHT SAYS WHEN YOURE RAISIN A CULTURE WITHOUT ETHICAL STRUCTURE YOU BECOME INTERNALLY FRAGILE YOU DON'T HAVE A MORAL COMPASS TOGIVE YOU DIRECTHION NO PERMANENT IDEALS TO WHICH YOU CAN SWEAR ULTIMATE ALLEGIANCE AND SO PEOPLE STAR TO SUFFER FROM WHAT EMIL DURCIME HAS CALLED ANEMY THIS IS TRUE I MAN ALL OF THIS IS TRUE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S HAPPEN THOUGH AND THAT IS AND ATTACK ON ALL THESE INSTITUTIONS A MOTIVATED ATTACK AND A RELIANCE ON THE NICENESS OF TE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO TOLERATE THE ATTACK  SUIT'S NOT JUST AN MEANTHIS IS TRUE A LOT OF THE MORAL EDUCATION WHENT AWAY THAT UNDERGRITTING NICENESS ITS KINDNESS AND KINDNESS AND NICENESS ARE NOT THE SAME THING BEING NICE TO SOME ONE MEANS THAT YOU JUST ARE INOFFENSIVE TO THEM BEING KINDS SOME ONE VERY OFTEN MEANS YOR LOOKING OUT FOR THEM MEANS THAT YOUCAN TELL THEM A THING THAT MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT A HERE IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A DRUG ABUSER AND YOU SIMPLY SAY YOU DO YOU THAT MAY BE NICE BUT IT'S NOT KIND IF YOU'VE A CHILD WHO DOES BAD THINGS ON THE REGULARK AND YOU JUST LET THEM DO IT THAT MAY BE NICE BUT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY KIND BUT WHAT'S HAPPEN IS OVER BUT KINDNESS IS UNDERGURDED BY A BELIEF IN SOME SORT OF HIGHER GOOD BECAUE WHT IT MEANS IS THAT YOU DO HAVE TO USE JUDGEME YOU'D DO HAVE TO BE JUDGEMENTAL YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT NOT BEING A DRUD GAGNET IT'S ACTUALLY MORALLY PREFERABLE TO BEING A DRUGATIC AR YATUALLYHAVE TO SAY THAT CERTAIN BEHAVIOR IS BETTER THAN NOTHER BEHAVIOR IT'S AN ACT OF KINDNESS TO CHIDE YOUR FELLOW WHEN HE GOES ASTRAY BUT NICENESS SAYS BUT THAT'S MEAN NICENESS SAYS THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING YOU SHOULD NOT DO AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE MORAL SYSTEM THAT IS BASE NOT ON KINDNESS BUT ON NICENESS WHEN YOU WIPE AWAY THE MORAL FRAMEWORK AND ALL YOU'R LEFT WITH IS NICEST OF COURSE NICENESS IS GOING TO FALL APART BECAUSE WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NICENESS  NICENESS LAST ONLY SO LONG AS SOME ONE'S FIST DOESN'T TUCH YOUR FACE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG IT' TURNS OUT TWHEN YOUN'T HAVE A SHARED MORAL FRAMEWORK KINDNESS TDIVOLVES INTO NICENESS AND THAT NICENESS HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CARE ABOUT YOU AT ALL AND THE PEOPLE WHOASHY DON'T ABIDE BY NICENESS ARE THE ENEFICIARIES INITIALAY AR THEN YOU HAVE AN ACTURAL PRISONER'S DILEMMA A GAME THEORY PRISONER'S DILEMMA IN WHICH THE PERSON WHO BENEFITS THE MOST OF THE PERSON WHO IS NOT NICE VIOLATES ALL THE RULES BECAUSE WHILE EUROPE PLAYING BY THE NICE RULES THERE'S DONE WHAT THEY WANT AND THE'R GETTING AHEAD AND THEY'RE WINNING AND SO YOU SAY WELL HOLD UP A SECOND I DON'T WANT O PLAY BY THOSE RULES I NET CON PLAY BY THOSE RULES EITHER AND THEN ITS JUST A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AND YOU CAN SEE THIS BY THE WAY IN THE PULLING DATA DEMOCRATSPOR EXAMPLE IN THE NINTY NINETIES BY LATE NINEUNINIES  DEMOCRAT'S THOUGHT THAT MOST REPUBLIC INS WERE ACTUALLY BAD PEOPLE AND REPUBLICANS STILL THOUGHT THAT MOST DEMOCRATS ORE JUST WRONG AND THEN AROUND TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STAFFS CHANGE AND REPUBLICAN STRARC SAY ALL MAY BE DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO BAD PEOPLE AND SO BOTH SIDES NOW THINK THE OTHER SIDE IS BAD PEOPLE WHY WHAT BECAUSE AGAIN DEMOCRATS WE'RE RELYING ON THE NICENESS OF REPUBLICANS WELL AT THE SAME TIME TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE THE LACK OF KINDNESS IN THE SYSTEM SO DAVID BROOK IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THAT LACK OF MORAL EDUCATION ISS THE PROBLEM THAT OF COURSE IS TRUE WHA IT'S ALSO PEOPLE BE AGRESSIVE IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE NICENESS OF OTHERS AND THAT MEANS SOCIAL RADICALISM THAT IS DESIGNED TO TEAR DOWN TE INSTITUTIONS THAT IS WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ININ ACTUAL ATTEMPT AT DISSOLVING THE INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES BE THIS WHERE DAVID BROOKS GOES WRONG BEC DAVID BROOKS NOW HE SIDES FOR EXAMPLE TED LASSO RIGHT AS AS AN EXAMPLE OP AA RESTORATION OF NICENESS HE SAYS IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY THE SERIOUS HED LASTO PROMERD WHEN LASSO DESCRIBES HIS GOALSAS SOCRICOACH HEU CULD MENTION THE CHAMPIONSHIPS HE HOPES TO WIN OR SOME OTHER CONVENTUNAL METRIC OF SUCCESS BUT HE SAYS FOR ME SUCCESS IS NOT ABOUT THE WINDS AND LOSSES IT' ABOUT HELPING THESE YOUNG FELLOWS BE THE BEST IVERSIONS OF THEMSELVES ON AND OFF THE FIELD HE SAYS THAT'S HA TWO SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF MORAL FORMATION BUT AS IT TURNS OUT WHAT TAD LASSO REALLY ANS UP BEING IS A MORAL RELAT OF US HE BASICALLY IN THE SERIES WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT IS THE MORALITY OF THE SERIES BY THE END THEREARE NO ACTUAL REAL EXPECTATIONS OTHER THAN SORT F A GENERIC NICENESS EVERYBODY ELSE HE CAN'T BILD A SOCIETY ON NICESS NO SOCIETY FUNCTIONS ON NICES  NICENESS IS A BY PRODUCTS OF KINDNESS WHEN YOU KILL KINDNESS  NICENESS WILL NOT REMAIN MEANWHILE THE ECONOMY LOOKS LIKE IT IS ABOUT TO TURN BAD I DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT BASICALLY WHAT GOES UP IS SCRING TO STAY UP AND EVER COME DOWN S LIKE MODERN MODITARY THERY THIS IDEA THEY CONJUST IN FLATE TO CURRENCY AND NOTHING WILLEVER HAPPEN ABOUT THAT TO GET FORTY YEAR HIGH IN INFLATION RIGHT NOW A LOT O LETS ARE BRING ARE BLINKING RYTHERS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN CHINA AND BY THE WAY CHINA IS IN INCIPIENT ROOMING DISASTR AREA I'V AN ENTIRE EPISODE MY NEW SERIOUS FACTS VILLBLON YOU TO WHERE IT REALLY IS SEEING A LOT OF LIGHT AND ALSO OVER ON EX SLASH TWITTER WHERE HAS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEUS SAYDS PROBABLY AT ABOUT A MILLION VIEWS TOTAL AT THE WENT ON VARIOUS PLATFORMS TALKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS PROMISE THE CHINIS EXPERIENCING BUT CHINUS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE THEYRE DEMOGRAPHICALLY COMPLETELY UPSIDE OWN THEYVE WAY MORE OLD PEOPLE THAN THEY HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE TO NO ONES CAN REL PITE BILLS THEY GET A SERIOUS THAT PROBLEMLY GAT REALLY SERIOUS STEMAC THAT PROBLEM AND THEY'RE NOW PURSUING A TARCIC ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT CUT THEM OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD MARKET WHICH MEANS THE CANOVY USE THEIR COMPARATIVE BANAGED PROPERLY SO THEY'RE REALLY IN N BLEEP LOAD OF TROUBLE HERE RIGHT NOW CCORNING T THE WALLS FOR JOURNAL CHINAS LATEST PROPERTY CRISIS THREATENING TO SPILL OVER INS THE BROADER ECONOMY WORRYING INVESTRES IN CAUSING A BROAD MARKET SELL OFF CHINESE STOCK FELL IN HONGKONG AND MAINLAND CHINA ON MONDAY WITH REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS ELECTRIC VEHICL MANUFACTURES AND OTHER COMPANIES IN ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE SECTORS TO CLINING THE MOST THE HING SAYING INDECTS WHICH IS LOADED WITH CHINESE COMPANIES DROPPES ONE POINT SIX PER CENT TAKING ITS EAR TO DATE LOSS TO FIVE POINT ONE PER CENDS THE FINANCIAL STRUGGLES OF COUNTRY GARDEN HOLDINGS CHINAS TOP SURVIVING PRIVATELY RUN EVELPER THAVE BEEN FRONTAN SENTESON SODMISS T INTEREST PAYMENTS ON TWO U S DOLLAR BONDS A WEEK AGO THE PROPERTY GIANT SAID THAT OVER THE WEEK END TRADING IN ELEVEN OF UONT DOMINATED DOMESTIC PONDS HAS BEEN SUSPENDED AND INTENDS TO DISCUSS REPAYMENT PLANS WITH INVESTORS THE PROPERTY SECTORES GONE FROM BEING A MASS OF CONTRIBUTE OFT CONTRIES OVER ALL GROWTH TO A MASS OF DRAG ON THE ECONOMY THT IS BECAUSE CHINA BASICALLY HAD A CIANT PYRAMID SCHEME GOING HERE THEY WOULD TAKE WRETIREMENT FUNDS FROM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN CHINA AND THY WOULD TELL THEM THAT IF THEY INVESTED IN EMPTY SHELL OF HARTMENTS IN GOS CITIES THAT THIS WOULD EVENTUALLY TURNE INTO REAL MONEY BECAUSE THOSE THOSE CITIES WOULD THEN BE POPULATED AND YOU MAKE A MONCH MONEY ON ON THOSE ON THOSE SHELL APARTMENTS AND TURNS OUT THAT THERE WAS NO ONE PICKING UP RENTAL ON THOSE SHELL APARTMENTS ON THE OTHER END SO THET MONEY JUST DISAPPEARED INTO THESE VAST CITIES TAT ARE COMPLETELY EMPTY AT THIS POINT ALL BUILT AROUND DEBT NEW HOME SAILES INCREASE IN THE FIRST FEW MONTH OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE PROVIDING A GLIMMER OF HOPE BUT THE MARKET THEN TURNED IN APRIL AND ITIUAIDE TAILS OF CHINAS TOP DEVELOPERS HAVE SLUMPED EVERSONS CHINASE NOW TROPPING INTO THE FLEETION HOUSEHOLDS ARE NOW BORROWING LEST BECAUSE THEY RACKED UP HIGH LEVELS OF SAVING CHINESE BANKS EXTENDED THE EQUIPLENT OF FORTY SEVEN POENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW LOANES IN JULY THAT IS DOWN NEARLY HALF FROM THE SAME MONTH ONE YEAR AGO THEIR CURRENCY IS DEPRECIATING PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY AT THIS POINT AGAIN IF CHINA'S ECONOMY TAKES A SERIOUS SDIP THAS CAN O HAVE A MAJOR IN PACKED ON AMERICAN MARKETS IT S TONKIN TO BE ALL ROSES FOR US BECAUSE WE ARE SO INTERTWINED WITH TH CHINESE ECONOMY AGAIN THANKS TO A LOT OF BAD FORM POLICY DECISION MAKING OVER THE COURSE OF LAST FEW DECADES PARTICULARLY THE DECISION TO SUGGEST THAT IF WE INTERTWINED OUR ECONOMY WITH CHINA THAT MAGICALLY CHINA WOULD LIBERALIZED WHICH OF COURSE THEY DID NOT MEANWHILE THOSE HIGHER COSTS WHICH ARE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMY THANKS TO THE CLLAPS OF THECHINESE ECONOMY THOSE HIGHER COSTS ARE GOING TO BE EXASTERBATED BY A NEW MODEL IN THE WEST OF SUBSIDIZATION AND A TENUATED TRADE LINGS ACCORDING TO THE WALLSTER JOURNAL THE WORLD'S BIGGEST ECONOMIES ARE OFFERING HUGE SUBSIDIES AND CUT THROAT WASTE TO WIN THE INDUSTRY OF THE FUTURES THE END THE LOSERS ARE ALL THE COUNTRIES THAT CAN'T PAY UP BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THEET THE LOSERS ARE ALSO THE INDUSTRIES THAT AR SUBSIDIZED THAT MONEY COMES FROM SOMEWHERE SUBSIDIES YOU JUST TAKE MONEY FROM SOME ONE AND YOU GIVE I TO ANOTHER PERSON IN THE HOPES THAT SECOND PERSON IS GOING TO USE THE MONEY ABETTER THE WISE THE GOVERNMENT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS HOW DO THEY CHOES WHO GETS TO WIN AND WHO GETS TO LOSE SUBSIDIZED INDUSTRIES BY THEWAY OVERTIME TEN BECOME FAT THEY TEN N BECOME LAZY THEY TEND TO HAVE HIGRATES OF UNION IS ATIONWENCH DHRIVES UP LABOR COST THA EVENTULLY TO GET UNDER CUT IS THE STORY OF THE AMERICAN CAR MARKET BY THE WAY FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THROUGH THE INETEEN SEVENTIES IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHOSE AMERICAN CARS ALL OVER THE WORLD BY THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES TOYOTA WAS EATING AMERICA'S LUNCH THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT WHEN YOU SUBSIDIZED INDUSTRIES TO THE POIN WERE THOSE INDUSTRIES DON'T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR COST STRUCTURE THEY CHARGE TOO MUCH THATG THY BER SUCH O COST TOO MUCH THEIR POST THEIR PART START TO COST TO MUCH AN EVENTUALLY SOMEBODY UNDERCUTS THEM RIGHT NOW THE LEVEL OF EM OF SUBSIDIZATION IS REALLY REALLY HIGH IN MAJOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES I'M NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IS O A PARTICULARY GOOD IDEA PARTICULARY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TOTALLY INEFFICIENT INDUSTRIES LIKE CLEAN ENERGY THE USE IS NOW OFFERING THREE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND INCENTIVES IN FONOMING FOR CLEAN ENER CHIS PART OF THE INFLETIONT REDUCTION ACT THE STARTING TO SEE A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE ON WORE BUILDING HERE BUT MAINLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS IN A PONY UP FOR A BUNCH OF THIS THIS IS ALSO COMBINE WITH THE DOWN FALLED GLOBALIZATION NOW THER LOT PEOPLE O TALK ABOUT GLOBAL SORO GLOBALISM AS A BAD INETEEA I I AGREE IN THE NLL SAID GLOBALIS ARE BAT IF YOUE SUNGLENT INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AMERICANS GIVING UP THEIR POWER TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS I AGREE IF WHAT YOURE SAYING IS THAT INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS A BAD THING BY MYOUR MIND YOU THAT IF WI WERE NOT FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE W IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE INFLATION NOW WAIT INTILL INTERNATIONAL TRADE GETS CUT OFF AF THE REALITIES WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THOSE WIDE OPEN SHIPPING LANES THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN INSURING ESSENTIALLY SINCE WORLD WARE TOO WHEN THOSE START TO FALL APART WHEN TRADE GOES DOWN THE COSTS ON EVERY THING THE CURRENTLY PAY FOR ITS CAN GO UP RADICALLY IT IS NOT JUST ATTER OF GLOBALIZATION HELPING LOW IN COME COUNTRIES WE'RE ONCE POOR COUNTRIES LIKE SOUTH COREA OR ATTIWAN IT IS ALSO THAT  THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES IS WAG BETTER NOW THAN IT WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY N I YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME GO LOOK AT THE CRAFT PEOPLE HAD IN THEIR HOUSE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SERIOUSLY LIKE PICK UP A PRODUCT TO NINETEEN EIGHTY THEY SUCK THEY'RE TERRIBLE I UNDERSTAND EVER WANTS TO BELIEVE TUT THE MIDDLE CLASS HASN'T GOTTIN ANY RICHERSINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY BAST ON FALSE PICTURES OF THE WAGE STAFFS BUT  THAT IS NOT TRUE THE STUFF OF THE AVERAGE MENTAL CLASS PERSON HAS NOW IS BETTER THAN PETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT RICH PERSON NANIN NINETEEN EIHTY THAT'S BECAUSE WHAT REAL WORLD ECONOMICS IS ABOUT IS THE CRETION OF NEW GOODS AND SERVICES THAT ARE BETTER AND CHEAPER AND THAT IS IN EFFACT OF GLOBALIZATION SO AS WE ON WINE GLOBILIZATION AND AS WE DIRECT MONEY IN SUBSTINIZATION WE ARE GONGTO GET A SLOWER ECONOMY THAT IS GOING TO BE THE THE END RESULTS IN ALL OF THIS AND FOR ONE OF THE LUCKY FEW IN ONE OF THESE SUBSTIDIZED INDUSTRIES YOU FEEL REAL GOODABOUT YOURSELF BUT IF YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE COSTICAN TO GUP PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE ELSE I'LL GATE TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AND THEN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SOT THINGS THAT I LIKE TO DAY SO IT TURNS OUT THAT TERRIBLE ECONOMIC POLICY HAS SOME AFROFACTS THIS WY REPUBLICANS IN THE UNITED STATES SHOULD TAKE HART IN THE FACT THAT EVENTUALLY JOBIDON SHOULD PAY FOR HIS  ECONOMIC CRIMES HERE IF REPUBLICANS HAVE THE BRAINS TO RUN SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY HAS SHOT AT WINNING THATD BE HE BIG ONE NOT SHING THE TOLET FROM COODNWIN HE COULD BUT ITS CAMPAN WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ABOUT THE ISSUES NOT ABOUT WHATEVER THE LEGAL ISSUE HE HAS TO DAY IS ABOUT THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ARGENTINA IS SHOWING THIS THE POSSIBILITY WHICH IS KIND OF WILD SO ACCORDING TO THE NER TIMES A FAR RIGHT LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE ONE ARGENTINE IS OPEN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION ON SUNDAY A SURPRISE SHOWING FOR POLITICION WANTS TO ADOPT THE AMERICAN DOLLAR AS ARGENTINE'S OFFICIAL CURRENCY AND EMBRACE IS COMPARISONS TEDONAL TRUMP HOV YOUR MELAY FIFTY TWO A CONGRESSMENT ECONOMISS AND FORMERT TO GEEP ON ITSCURED THIRTY PERCENTS OF THE BOAT WITH NINETY SIX PERCENTS OF THE BALLAS COUNTED MAKING THE FRONT RUNNER FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN THE FALL GENERAL ELECTIONS IT AS A CLEAR SHOT AT LEADING ARGENTINA ARGENTIN IS GENERAL ELECTION IN OCTOBER WHICH WH COULD GO TO A NOVEMBER RUN OFF WILL NOT BECOME A NEW TEST OF STRENGTH OF THE FAR RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD AGAIN THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS THAT IF YOU ARE ANYWHERE TO THE RIGHT OF CARAL MARKS ACCORDING TO THE OUR TIMES YOU ARE FAR RIGHT ALTHUGH HARD RIGHT FORCES HAFE GAINED A NEW INFLUENCE AND SEVERAL POWE FULNATIONS IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDING YUUST GERMANY FRANCE ITALY SWEETEN AN VIDDLAN THIF SUFFERE SOME DEFEATS INCLUDING IN SPAIN AND BRAZIL MILET HAS PITCHED HIMSELF IS THE RADICAL CHANGE AT THE COLLAPSING ARGENTINE ECONOMY NEEDS HE COULD BE A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM IF ELECTED BESIDES THIS O CURRENTS HIS IDEAS ABOUT THE CURRENCY AN CENTRAL BANK HIS PROPOSED DRASTICALLY LOWERING TAXES CTTING PUBLIC HEALTH SPENDING CLOSING OR PRIVATIZING ALL STATOAN ENTERPRISES AND ELIMINATING THE HEALTH EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT MINISTRIES SURGOMAS OF THE ARGENTINE SCENTR LEFT FINANCE MINISTER FINISH SECOND IN THE PRIMARIH JUST TWENTY ONE PER CENTS OF THE BOAT THE THIRD PLACE FINISUR PATRICIA BULRICH IS IT CONSERVATIVE AND SHES IN THIRD PLACE O SEVENTEINE WHICH MEANS THE TO OUT OF THE TOP THREE ARE CONSERVATIVES AND NEARLY THE TOP TO THE SUNDAY RESULTS SHOWED THAT ARGENTINAS THREE SUPPER COALITIONS HAVE SIMILAR LEVELS OF SUPPORT MAKE AN UNLIKELY THAT ANYONE WILL ACTUALLY WIN IN THE FIRST ROUND THESEN TO RIGHT COLITIONS CANDIDATES RECEIVED TO COMBINED A TWENTY EIHT PERCENT OF THE OTE ON SUNDAY THE CENTRA LEFT RECEIVED TWENTY SEVEN PERSENT BOTH SLIGHTLY LESS THAN MELAS TOTAL AS WELL MULA SAID WERE NOT ONLY GOING TO AND CURCHONERISM THAT IS REFERENCE TO FORMER PRESIDENT CRISTINTHE FERNONDOS THE CERCHENER WERE ALSO GOING TO AND THE USELESS PARISATIC CRIMINAL POLITICAL CAST THAT IS SINKING THIS COUNTRY HE ALSO O THANKS HIS SISTER AND ALL OF HIS DOGS WHO ARE EACH NAMED AFTER A CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS WHICH IS OUSUM MEN THIS IS THE RESULT OF BAD LEFT OING POLICY SEE THIS WAY POLTICS WORKS WHEN LEFT RUN THINGS THY TO A BAD JOB PEOPLE SWIVVEL TO THE RIGHT IF YOU GIVE THEM SOME ONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF TALKING OUT THE ISSUES PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO HERE ABOUT OKE OTHER THINGS THAT I LIKE SO YOU TO HAD TO APPARENTLY REVERSE COURSE AFTER THEY ADTEMPTED TO THROTTLE A VIDIO THAT WE DID FOR OUR NEW SERIOUS FACTS WE DID O VIIO ONU TOB ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION GARM WHICH IS ESSENTUALLY A A CONSORESIUM OF ADVERTIZERS THAT WORK TO SHUT DOWN ALL ADVERTISING ON CONTROVERSIAL PLATFORMS BY CONTRVERSIAL THE JUST MEAN BASICALLY RIGHT WING PLATFORMS EVEN IF THEIR VERY MAIN STREAME WELL YOU TO THEN DEMONOTIZE THE VIDIO CLAIMING THAT IT WAS CONSPIRATORIO MEDIO RESEARCH CENTER PRESS TU TO AABOUT WHY MONETIZATION WAS SUPPRESSED APPARENTLY YOU TO EFFECTIVELY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PLATFORM HAD LIMITED TH VIDIO IN THE FIRST PLACE A YUE TO ESPOKES PERSONS THAD IN ORDER FOR VIDIO TOMOOTIZE ON YOUE WET MUST COMPLY WITH OUR ADVERTISER FROM THE GUIDLINES WHICH ARE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AND APPLY TO ALL CREATORS PONER VIEW THE VIDIO IN QUESTION IS CURRNATLY MONOTIZINGS THEY REVERST THEMSELVES WHICH IS OF FUNNY BECAUSE TOM THEY DN'T TELL THAT TO US AGAIN THEY THEY CLAIMS THAT WE DISCUSSED THE NEW WORLD ORDER WHICH THEY NON MONOTIZABLE CONSPIRACY THEORY BUT UM THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS CONSPIRATORIAL ABOUT THE ACTUAL EPISODE WHICH SIMPLY NAMES THE VARIOUS SUBJECTIVE GUIDLINES PUT IN PLACE BY THESE ADVERTISING COLLUSIVE REGIMES SO I'M GLAD THA YOU TO BACKDOWN EON MASQUE DID SEE THE VIDIO AND HE ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE THE WIT DISSOLVE THIS WOULD BE TO HAVE A BASKET OF SAFE CONTENT IN A BASKET OF UNSAFE CONTENTS THAT OF COURSE IS NOT RIGHT BECAUSE THE PROBEM IS WHO GETS DECIDE WHAT IS SAFE IN WHAT IS ONSEV THE SAMIXACK GROUPS AR CURRENTLY USING EXACTL Y THOSE GUISES IN ORDER TO PUSH CENSORSHIP WHATL WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO IS BLOW UP THES COLLUSIVE ENTERPRISES ENTIRELY AND THEN ADVERTISERS GET THO ESIDE ON THEIR OWN WHAT THEY WANT PUT THEIR ADVERTISING ON IF THEY DID THAT THOY'D BE A LOT FIFT THEY'D BE A NORMAL MARKET MECHANISM AS A POSEED SORT OF COLLUSION THEY WERE SEEING RIGHT NOW O KAT TIME FOR A THING THAT I HATE SO MICHAEL OR YOU REMEMBER HIM HE WAS A POPULARIZED TO TH FORMER AND I

SO TO DAY IS THE DAY IT IS THE IWAL CAUCAS IS THE PRIMARIES HAVE FINALLY AT LONG LAST BEGONE THE IWA CAUCASES TO DAY IN OF COURSE IOWA THIS RE PUBLICAN PRIMARY IS GOING TO DECIDE WELL NOT ALL THAT MUCH UNLESS DONALD TRUM FALLS ON HIS FACE THE EXPECTATIONS FOR DONALD TRUMP OURCORS THAT HE'S GOING TO WIN BY AN EXTRAORDINARILY WHIDE MARCHI AN BY THE POLLING DATA HE HAS THE LARGEST LEED AMONG ANY REPUBLICAN NOMINY IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY THE LATEST POLES THAT ARE OUT FROM IWA SHOW HIM IS THE ONE FROM THE DEMOINE REGISTER AND BISINUWS AN MEDIAT COMIN SHOWS TRUMP WITH FORTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE VOTE THAT AS FOLLOWED NOW BY NICKEY HALEY AT TWENTY PER CENT GOVERNOR RONDO SANTIS AT SIXTEEN PER CENT VACROMA SWAMY AT EIGHT PER CENT THAT MEANS THAT DONALD TRUMCAS A TWENTY EIGHT PER CENTAGE POINT LEAD IN THAT PARTICULAR PRIMARY GOING IN WHICH MEANS THAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE THAESE CAN BLOW AWAY THE REST OF THE FIELD THE REAL QUESTION IS ONE DOES HE AND TWO BY HOW MUCH THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION GOING IN OTHE REASON I SAY THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY TECIDE ALL THAT MUCH THE IWA CAUCASES UNLESS TRUMP FALLS ON HIS FACE IS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A BUNCH OF CANDIDATES WIN THE IWA CAUCES IN THEN GO ON TO FAIL IN THE REST OF THE PRIMARIES GEORGE SHALLBY BUSH WHEN THE IWA CAUCSES IN TWO THOUSAND HINTED UP WINNING OF COURSE BUT MY CUCKABY WHEN THE IWA CAUCASES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RICK SANTORUM WHEN THE IWA CAUCSES IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVES HAD CRUWS WHEN TE IWA CAUCASES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN LITERALLY NONE OF THEM BECAME THE NOMINY SO THE IWA CAUCES ARE NOT HIGHLY PREDICTIVE OF WHO WILL BE THE NOMINY TBUT THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFERENT RACE ONLY IN THE CENTS THAT BECAUSE DONAL TRUMP IS SUCH AN OVERWHELMING FAVORITE THE QUESTION IS GOING TO BE WHETHER THE GOD BLEEDS A DONAL TRUMP IS SO FAR AHEAD OF THE REST OF FIELD IN EVERY SINGLE PRIMARY AT THIS POINT THAT IF HE SHOWS WEAKNESS IN THIS EARLY PRIMARY IT COULD BE A PROBLEM AT FOR HIM NOW AN ORDER FOR HIM TO SHOW WEAKNESS IN THE EARLY PRIMARY ONE OF TWO THINGS HAS TO HAPPEN EITHER RONDA SANTUS HAS TO WILDLY OUP PERFORM OR NICKEY HALEY HAS TO WILDLY OUT PERFORM ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS HAS TO HAPPEN NEW HAMPSHIRE OF COURSE IS MUCH CLOSER IND EVERYBODY IS ARDY POINTING FORARD TOWARD THE FUTURE PRIMARIES THOSE CON ME NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA IN NEW HAMPSHIRE RIGHT NOW THE LATEST POLLING TTOR FROM W H D H EMER CEN HAS DONALD TRUMP UP FORTY FOUR TWENTY EIGHT OVER NICKEY HAILEY  CHRIS CRISTY JUST TROPPED OUT TO PRESUMBLY A LOT OF THAT SUPPORTS AN GO TWO NICKEY HALY RONASANTIS IS RUNNING IN SINGLE TIGETS IN NEW HAMPSHIRES NICKEY HALEYS THE ONLY PERSON WHESHY HAS A SHOT AT DONAL TRUMP IN NEW HAMPSHRE ND THE YOU MEW FOARD TWO SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE REALLY IS NOT A LOT I GOD POLING IN SOUTH CAROLINA AT THIS POINT NICKEY HALEYOF COURSE OF THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA SO HURE THE VARIOUS PATHS IF DONALD TRUMP WINDS IWA WALKING AWAY THE'GL HAVE A LOT OF MOMENTUM GOING INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE A PROBABLY WI EW HAMPSHIRE THAT HA EN SOUTH CAROLINA H'LL SWEEP IT'S OVER IF DONALD TRUMP WILDLY UNDER PERFORMS AND SA NICKEY HALEY EITHER WINDS OR COMES IN I STRONG SECONDS IN THE IW CAUCASES N THEN GOES AHEAD AND WINS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THEN WE HAD DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINA AND THINGS GET A LITTLE INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE OF COURSE HAS A FAIRLY SOLID BASES OF SUPPORT IN SOUTH CAROLINA GIVEN THE FACT THAT SHE WAS GOVERNOR THERE AND THEN YOU MOVE ON TO FUTURE PRIMARIES AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT FOR EXAMPLE NEW YORK REPUBLICANS ARE GON A FOR EXAMPLE LOVE DONALD TRUMP OVER SOMEONE LIKE NICKEY HALEY IS TRUMP STILL THE FAVORITE UNDER THAT CENARIO WHERE TRUMP WINDS IWA LOSES NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IT'S PRETTY CLOSE AN SOUTH COWN TRUMP IS CERTAINLY STILL THE FAVORITE UNDER THAT SIN AREO BUT YOU SEE A PATH FERONA SANTIS TO SANTUS HAS TO PROBABLY WIN THE IWA CAUCASIS TO DAY IF TO SANTIS COMES IN SECOND UNLESS IT'S A VERY CLOSE SECOND UNLESS HE FINISHES THEN TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS OVE DONALD TRUMP IN THIS PRIMARY HIS PATH NARROWS TREMENDOUSLY HE HAS NO SHOT IN NEW HAMPSIRE ACCORDING TOTHE PULLING DATA IN SOUTH CAROLINA IGEN N OW LAT GOOD PULLING DATA IN SOUTH CAROLINA BUT HE WOULD HAVE TO OUTWAY TRUMP AND PRESUMABLY NICKEY HAILEY AS WELL AND GANT NICKEY HALEY HAS STRONG GROUND GAME IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND A SANC S BEEN SENDING AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME IN IWA TO SANTIS HAS DONE ALL OF THE GROUND WORK IN IWA MORE GROUND WORK THAN PETY MUCH ANY OTHER CANDIDATE HE ONLY OTHER CANDIDATEWHAS BEENON THE GROUND MORE IS PROBABLY THE VA ROMASUAMY WHO'S BEEN TRAVELLING ACROSS THE STATE BACK AND FORTH AND ALL THE REST WIL GET TO HAM IN A MINUTE BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP REALLY SHIVED HIM THE GUT OVER THE WEAKEN AGAIN THE BIG PROBLEM FOR TRUMP THE ONLY PROTEM FOR TRUMP IS THAT THE LEVEL OF EXPECTATION FOR HIM IS SO HIGH THT IF HE COMES IN LOW YOU COULDN'T GEREDICALLY HAVE A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HIS TEAM IS THAT LIKELY TO MATERIALIZE YOU KNOW I THINK NOT THE REASON I THINK NOT IS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE VERY VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT DONALD TRUMP NOW ENTHUSIASMS CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO NIGHT IN THE IWA CAUCASIS WHY BECAUSE IT IS CREAKING COLD OVER THERE MEAN RIGHT NOW INTO MOIN IT IS EXPECTED TO BE AS IF TO NIGHT NEGATIVE NINE DEGREES NEGATIVE NINE DEGREES THE THESE ARE THERE'S A WIN CHILL WARNING THAT HAS GONE OUT FOR SAFETY REASONS IT'S IT ZERO DEGREES ALL DAY LONG AND THEN IT DIPS TO NEGATIVE NIDE IT TO NIGHT WHEN PEOPLE FINISHED WORK IN ACTUALLY ARIGAN A GO AND CAUKUS THAT IS IF YOU'RE A MARGINAL CANDIDATE OR SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF ENTHUSIASM WHAT'S HERE NICKY HAILEY SO RIGHT NOW NICKEY HALEY HAS BEEN SERGING IN THE PULLING IN IWA HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE LIKE DEVO TAE OF NICKY HALEY AS SUPPOSED YOU DESANCIS CORP WHICH IS REALLY REALLY STRONG IN IWA AND TRUMSCORE WICH IS REALLY REALLY STRUNG AN IWA AGAIN IF I'VE TO BALL PARK THIS AND WEATHER IS GOING TO PLAY A FACTOR I WOUD SUGGEST THAT HALEY UNDER PERFORMS THE PULSILO A MIT AN IWA AND TA SANTIS OVER PERFORMS PERFORMS THE POLES FAIRLY SUBSTANTIALLY IN IWA I THING TRUMP IS PROBABLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO DOMINATE IN IWA THAT'S IF I HAD TO BALL PARKET RIGHT NOW O DONAL TRUMP IS IN FACT ON THE GROUND IN IWA DOING SOMMER ALLEYS AND IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE'S HAVIN A GOD TIME RIGHT TRUMP THINKS THAT HE HAS MOMENTUM BECAUSE LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS BY PULLING DATA HE DOES II HAVE TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TRUMP IS GOING TO DO WELL IN STATES EVEN WITH BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS IS BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE ARE REAL DIHARS WE ALL KNOW THIS RY PEOPLE WHO LOVE TRUMP LAV TRUMP GET TO MOR ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE THE KING A KING OF AN EMPIRE AND YOU ARE GOING TO EDUCATE YOUR SON IN THE WAYS OF THAT KINGDAM BUT YOUR BROTHER WAS DETERMINED TO LEAD A REVOLT AGAINST

TRUMP FROM AN INTERNET CREATOR AND IT'S A PRETTY WILD DABBUT IT DOES SHOW YOU T LEVEL OF TE'R FUELTY THAT MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS HAVE FOR NOW TRUMP ON A PERSONAL LEVEL THEN ON YOUR IMPORTANTAN II MOR

ANAN AN IN ON IN OI I ON AN O U GAN  AN ASAANIA BUGIN BUT LISTEN I THING DOWN OL TRUMPE TAT A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS AS PRESIDENT BUT THE REAL IMPORTANCE OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THAT IF YOUR TRUMP SUPPORT IN SURDAGREES ARE YOU SILGAN GO VOTE FOR TRUMP THE ANSWER IS KIND OF YES THIS IS THE BIG THRET BY THE WAY TO JOBITON THE BIG THREATS O JOBIDON IS NOT THAT TRUMPSNGAN ALTPOLL HIM BY TEN POINTS THE BIG THREATS TO JOBIDON IS TRUMP SUPPORTERS WILL CRAWL OVER BROKEN GLASS TO VOTE VERNONAL TRUMP AND JOBIDON SUPPORTERS WI'LL NOT THAT IS THE REAL THREATS TO JOBIDON IN THE GENERAL A LECTION SO BASE ENTHUSIASM DOS AT MEANALO TRUMP AGAIN WHO'S HAVING A GOOD TIME ON THE STUMP  HE SHUT UP IN THE MDDLE THE NIGHT N O IS WEARING LIKE A COE LOOK TOLE BAT RUMBOLD AND SOME PEOPLE ARE MAKING FUN OF THAT THE NONT CARS A MEAN A LITERALLY KNOWING CAIRS AND THEN HE SHOWS UP AT TA IN INDIANOA IN H IOUP AND A AND HE SAYS GUIS IF YOU  SHOW UP AND YOU VOTE ANDTHEN YOU DIE IF HYPOTHERMIA IT'S WORTH IT HE'S JOKING THE MEDOR TRYD TO TREAT THE SERIOUS LAY HE'S JOKING OBVIOUSLY AN ITS VERY FUNNY HE AN PASSO ERA CHE YES OTHE RE OS I GATE SO BY THE WAY HIS VOTERS WELL I PEE BEGONG TO SHOW UP FOR HIM HACLERIS SHOWED UP AT THIS EVENT BY THE WAY ANDA HE STARTED TAUNTING THEM SEE THAT THE MAGIC POWER THE TRUMP HAS ALWAYS HADS THAT HE'S IS STAND OF COMMEDIAN EVERAY TREATS HIM LIKE A NORMAL POLITICAL RETORITION AND THAT OF COURSE IS SILLY HE CONSTANTLY HERE DEMOCRESILY HE DOESN'T TALK LIKE A REGULAR PRESIDENT AND IT'S REALLY BAD EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IT'S ALL BAKED INTO THE CAKE AND HONESTLY HIS CHARM IS THE FACT THAT HE IS BASICALLY TRIUMPH THE INSULT COMIC DOG BUT A POLITICIAN AN NO EMERO THE ROINS AND I BEN  IRI RE GAHAMNMANE  THE TRUMP THEN IS PUTTING IS PUTTIG OUT STATEMENTS ATTACKING JOBIDON WHICH IS CRAKS HAS SO LET ME GET THIS STRAHT WERE DROPPING BOMBS ALL OVER THEM AT LEAST AGAIN WRITE IF HE DEDISE US NOUR SECRETARE OF DEFENCE JUST WHEN MISSING FOR FIVE DAYS IS RUNNINGTHE WAR FRM HIS LAPTOP IN A HOSPITAL ROOM REMEMBER THIS THE SAME GAING THAT SURRENDERD NAFCANTISTAND WHERE KNOWN IS HEL TO COUNTABLE AR FIRED THOR'S MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF TE UNITED STATES NOW HAVE WORSIN YOU CRANE IS RAL AND AMAN BUT NO WAR ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER OH THAT MAC E LOT OF SENTS  CROOKED JOBIDON IS TH WORST PRESENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THIS IS WHITE DONALD TRUMPWRIGHT NOW IN THE PULLING DATA IS BEATING JOBIDON IS NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE TRUMP HE HAS BASE THE LOVES HIM IS BEJUST PEOPLE THINK THAT JOBIDAN STINKS HE IS CURRENTLY PULLING IN THEAPPROVALRATINGS AT THIRTY THREE YOU SU CANT WIN REELECTIN IF THOSE NUMBERS THERE'S NO WAY TO WHIN REELECTIONS WITH THOSE NUMBERS EVEN IF YOU THINK THE DONALD TRUMP ON THE BALLOT IS GOING TO DRIVE DEMOCRATIC TURN OUT ONL GATE SO ALL OF THIS THESE I WILL CAUXIS TEY'R COMING UP ALL THIS LED TO A STRANGE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND A CANDIDATE WHO HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY PRAISE WORTHY OF DONALD TRUMP WHICH HAS RAISED THE QUESTION TH ENTIRE CAMPAGN IS T WHY HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THE BE THE VAKE ROMASUOMMY NOW THERE FEW REASONS THAT YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THOSE REASONS IS BECAUSE ONE O RAISE IDEAS AND I THINK THAT TE VAKE IN SOME CASES HAS RAISED REALLY IMPORTANT IDEAS I THINK THE TAVAKE FOR EXAMPLE HAS CLUB THE MEDIA ABOUT THE EARS AND THAT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL TO WATCH BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WE ARE NOW AT THE POINT OF THE PRIMARIS FOR PEOPLE ARE DOING THE VOTING AND SO OVER THE WEEK END A BIG MISTAKE WAS MADE BY VAVAKE AND TRUMP ABSOLUTE CLOBBERD IM SO VAVAKE WAS MAKING THE CASE PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM THE IOL CAUCASES THE PROBEM OF COURSE THAT TRUMP IS ACTUALLY IN THE IWILL CAUCASES AND YOU CAN VOTE FOR TRUMP AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU IN THE RACE YOU THNG THE TRUMP IS SO UNBELIEVABLY GRAT AND IF YOU'RE ENTIRE ROLL IN THE RACES TO DEFEND TRUMP WHY ARE YOU HERE YOU S OU DROP OUT NOW RIGT YOU'VE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE YOUVE BEEN A STALKING HORSE FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINTS POLITICALLY SPEAKING YOU'VE GOTTEN DONE WHET NEED GET BUT BUT VAVAK AS STILL THE RACEON THIS TO POINT THE TRUMP IS GIN TO MAKE MOMENTARILY SO THE VAKE WITS TELLING PEOPLE THAT IN ORDER TO SAVE TRUMP YOU HAVE TOVOTE FOR HIM WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE THAT MAKES NO SENS BECAUSE DONAL TROM DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DOES NOT THE NEED AVA GROMASAMMY IN THE RACE MEA BY POLLING DATA AGAIN BUT VA ROMASUAMY'S PULLING EIGHT PER CENT N IWA BY POLLING DATA TEVAK ROMASUAMMY IS CURENTLY PULLING AT FOUR PER CENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SO NO DONAS ROM DOES NOT NEED TEVAKE BROMASUAMMY IN THE RACE IN ANY WAY SHAPE PER FORM AND AGAIN WAT'SN'T IT IT'S IF YOU MUST STAYIN THE RACE YOU DOTALLY GAN IT'S FREE COUNTRY BUT HE'S OVES YOU NOT GOINGTO BE THE NOMINE THIS TIME FOR SHORE AND AGAIN IT'S O VERY WEIRD CAMPAIGNG THT YOU'R RUNNING WHERE YOU'RE LITERALLY SAYING THAT THE GUIDE WHO'S ON THE OTHER SUIDE OF THE STAGE IS THE BEST PRESIDENT OF YOUR LIFETIME YOU HAVE NO CRITIQUES FOR HIM BUT YOUR STOLNE THE RACE SO HERE IS WEVAKE MAKING A WEIRD CASE IN THAN TRUMP JUST CLOBBERING HIM ITIS WHAT SAFE WHAT A SAVE TRUMP YOUPLE I'M TELLIG O THAT YOM ORYEU'R SENDING HIN FLEC BUT YOU'RE SENDING HIM TO HIS OWN TE MONS Y YOU'RE FALLING INTO THE TRUMP THAT I LA COUNTRY'S FOLLING IN THAT HES FALL WON SAFE TRUMPPL FOR ME I MEEN YOU SUPPORT T I WI CO THAT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT'S THE ARGUSTHAT BITSTOT ANARGUMENT IT'S THE TRUTH DO THE RIGHT THING FORTY FOR THIS CONTRY THAT ASI WORKTHANK YOU NO GA I'M I'M SORRY THAT MAKES THAT SO THE REASON HE'S SAYING THIS IS HE SAYING THE TRUMP IS GON TO GET CON VICTED OF A CRIME AND THEN HE'S GOING TO LOSE SO BETTER THAT YOU SHO NOMINATE ME AND THEN I WILL SAVE TRUMP BY PARDONING HIM THAT IS SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE BANKSHI BE CAUSE TRUMP IS AGAIN IN THE DRIVER SEAT IN THIS RACE WGET'S MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST ARE YOU STRUGGLING WITH BACK TAXES OR HAVE UNFILED RETURNS AT THIS YEAR THE IRES IS NOW ESCALATING COLLECTIONS BY ADDING TWENTY THOUSAND NEW AGENTS OR NO IN THES CHALLENGING TIMES YOU'RE BEST OFFENCE IS TO USE TAX NETWORK YOU S A E OVERE FOURTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCED TAX NETWORK YOU U SAY HAS SAVE THEIR CLIENTS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN BACK TAXES THEY SPECIALIZEIN NEGOTIATING WITH THE IRESS THEY AIN'TRODUCE YOUR THAT SIGNIFICANTLY TAX NAT WORK YOU USA DOESN'T

IRES RUININ YOUR LIFE IF BEHIND ON THOSE BACK TAXES YOU GOT O GET THAT IRON OW TURN TO TAX NETWORK YOU USA RIGHT NOW HAT ANOVER TO T AND U S A DOT COM SLASH APERO SO THIS LAD DONALD TRUM TO GO ON TRUTE SOCIAL IN PUT OUT THEVAKE STARTED HIS CAMPAIGN AS A GREAT SUPPORTER THE BEST PRESIDENT IN GENERATIONS ET CETERA UNFORTUNATELY NOW ALL HE DOES IS DISGUISE IS SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF DECEITFUL CAMPAIGN TRICTS VERY SLY BUT VOTE FR A VAK IS S VOTE FOR THE OTHER SIDE DON'T GET DUPE BY THIS VOTE FOR TRUMP DON'T WAST YOUR VOT BAVAK IS NOT MAGO THE BIDANG INDICTMENTS AGAINST HIS POLITICAL OPPONENT WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED IN THIS COUNTRY THET ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO FALL MAGA AND THEN TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISEOR CRISTLIS OVET UP UNWEASHED ON ROMASUAMMY ON AC AN HOUR BEFORE THAT THERE'S A PHOTO THAT SHOWED VAVAK STANDING WITH A BUNCH OF YOUNG MEN WEARING SHIRTSTHATS TAT SAVE TRUMP VOTE VAVAKE ANLESS IVETO WROTE HERE IS A GREAT PICTURE OF THIS CAMPAIGNS NUMBER ONE FRAUD TRUMP DOESN'T NEED SAVING IF YOU SUPPORT D DONAL TRUMPBY SURE IS HELD DON'T DON'T VOTE FOR THIS FAKE SO THIS OBVIOUSLY WAS VERY VERY BAD FOR VAVAKE WHO IS SPENT HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN BASICALLY MAISOSHING TRUMP MEN YEUT YOU LITERALLY COULD NOT GET HINTO CRITICIZE TRUM ON ON VIRTUALLY ANY TOPIC AND AGAIN THERE MANY REASONS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT BUT IT'S VERY HAR TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT TH WHAT YOURE ACTUALLY DOING HIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHEN YOU SPEND THE ENTIRE CAMPAGN MASASHING ONE OF THE OTHER GUISE AND VAVAKE CAN DO THAT MEAN THAT THERE IS A THERE IS AN ACTUAL PLAN BY VAVAE WHEN IS BEING LAID OUT BY THE WALLSTRY JOURNAL THAT HIS ACTUAL STRATEGY WAS WAIT FOR TRUMP TO DROP OUT THAT TRUMP ASHOU GETS HIT BY INTITEMENTS TRUMP GETS DEFEATED SUMPTHING HAPPENS TO TRUMP AND THEN ALL TRUMP SUPPORT FLOATS OVER TO VAVAK AND VAVAKES BASELY THE CATCH ALL FOR TRUMP SUPPORT SE U SPEND THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN TROGMOW WONDERFUL TRUMP IS IN CASE GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENS TO TRUMP AND THEN AVAK IS STANDING RIGHT THERE THIS WITH THE WALLSTRY TOURNAL IS SAYING ROMASTWAMMY'S PLAN IS ESSENTIALLY TOWATED OUT TO TAKE OVER THE FORM PRESIDENT'S VOTER BASE SHOULD THE FORMER PRESIEN BE COME INELIGIBLES RUNS DO IS MANY DUE TO HIS MANY LEGAL CHALLENGES THIS IS THE CASE THAT VAVAKE WAS MAKING AND MEANWHILE TRUMP IS LIKE NO NOT INTERESTED AT ALL WHY ARE YOU HERE LIKE IF YOU LOVE ME SO MUCH GET OUT SO YET VERY BAD MOMENT FOR AVAKE IN THE CAMPAIGN AND THEN VAVAK CONTINUES TO TRY TO YOU KNOW HE TRIES TO EXPLAIN HIS WAY OUT OF IT SAIT I RESPECT THAT HELL OUT OF TRUMP HE'SHE BEST PRESIDENT OF THE TWENTY FOR SENTURY HAVE TOFENDEN HIM AND EVERY STEP AGAINST THE UN JUST PERSECUTIONS TUT OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE HARD TROUT THE SYSTEMWALL STOP IN NOTHING TO KEEP THIS MAN AWAY TRUM THE WHITE HOUSE WHICH IS IN FACT THE SAME ARGUMENT WEARDLY THAT NICKEE HAILEY IS MAKING I WHICH THAT TRUMP CAMPWIN IT'S ALSO HE SAME ARGMENT THA THE SANTIS MAKING BUT THEY'RE MAKING IT OPENLY AND VAVKE WAS MAKING IT MORE CALVERTLY WHICH IS WHIE TRUMP HIS BASELY TALLING HIM OUT FOR ALL OF THAT SO 'S A VERY WEIRD MOMENT WITH TRUMP AND VAVAKE IS THAT CAN TO HAVE ANY LIK SERIOUS IMPACT ON THE RACE NO BECAUSE VAKE WAS PALLING AT EIGHT PERCENT THE FIRST PLACE I' BE VERY SHOCKED IF HE GETS AT EIGHT PERSENT IN THE AROCOXIS PARTICULARLY AFTER TRUMP SMACKEDHIM DOWN OVER THE WEAKEN MEANWHILE THERE ARE OTHER CANDUTS WHO ACTUALLY WOULD THEORATICALLY MAY O BE AS WE DISCUSSED AT THE TOP  OIF YOU CAN KIND TO SEE OU LIKE THROUGH A GLASTHIRICALLY MABE HAVE SOME SORT OF SHOT AT TRUM THOSE WHO BE PRESUMABLY DISANTUS AND HAILI GAY SOT WHAT DOES THE SANTIS NEED THE STANDIS BASECLY NEN TO WIND TO NIGHT HE NEDS A WIN OR HE EEDS A VERY TRUNK SECONT WITHIN SINGLE DIGENTS OF DONALD TRUMP IN ORDER TO RE VIVIFY HIS CAMPAIGN NOW THE ONLY WAY THAT HAPPENS IF THE POLLS ART WHILDLY WRONG OR THE SAND I SUPPORT IS SO DIMOND HARD IN I WA THAT IT WITH STANDS THE WEATHER IN A WAY THAT SAY NICKEY HAILEY'S SUPPORT DOES N ON SO TO SANT AS SPENT THE WEEKAND TALKING ABOUT SURPASSING ATKXPECTATIONS AND AGAIN IT IS TRUE THAT IN AMERICAN POLITICS YOU CAN BE A QORNT WILL COME BACK KID WITHOUT ACTUALLY WINNING THIS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO BUILL CLINTON HE WAS THE COME BACK KID NOT BECAUSE HE ENDS IT UP ACTUALLY WINNING IN THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES IS ONE BY PULL TONGUS BUT BIL CLINTON MANAGED A SECOND PLACE FINISHE IS IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO ADTHEN HE START CALLING HIMSELF THE COME BACK KID RIGHT WHICH AGAIN THOUG THOSE VERY WEIRD BECAUSE ON JANUARY NINETEENTH OF THAT YEAR CLINTON WAS ACTUALLY AHEAD OF THE FIELD AT TWENTY NINE PER CENT IN SONG IS HAD SEVENTEEN PER CENT AND THEN THERE RE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT BILL CLINTON AND SEN FOR FLOWERS AND THEIR AFFAIR ANDTHEN HE FELL REALLY FAR BEHIND AND THEN HE ENDS IT UP IN THE EN LOSING BY LICE NINE PER CENT THAN HE SAIR CALLINGHIMSELF TO COME BACK KIDDEN OF COURSE HE AND UP WINNING THE NOMINATION SO YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME DYNAMIC YHE ARETICALLY HERE IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SUCH LOW EXPECTATIONS OF THE SANTTOS HAVING SLID DOWN AND MANY OF THE POLLS ALWAY TO THERTEN ILEOFCHIS THE STATE WHEREYE SPENT THE MOST MONEY AND MOST TIME THAT MAYBE IF HE OUT PERFORMS THOSE POLESE PETTIES RAMATICALLY SOMEHOW YOU GET TO COME BAK KID NARRATIVE HERE IS TO SANTIS TRYINGTO MAKE THAT CLAM SO SIMPLE CLUSSNER GEN AWIN ILE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I SINCE THAT I'VE I'VE LEARN THAT IT'S GOOD TO BE AN ENDER DOG WENT FOLKS WANT TA COUC IT OUT WHEN THEY WANT U SAY O YOU KNOW THESS WHEN THEY WANT A CIT CITE THESE POLLS I MAYI THIN THAT THATHE ART'S E PORTER HERE I THINK I WHEN GENERALLY I THINK THEY THEY ROLL THE ISES AT SOME OF THESE POLLS BECAUSE HOW YOU CAN POLL A CAWKGES A LAT'S LAT'S ANE IN NEGET IV TWENTY TWO SO AR VOTERS ARE ALREADY THERE GET A TURN OUT WEE

BITIN IS A VERY FEEBLE WEEK AND AND POR PRESIDENT AND SO I THINK SOME OF IT IS THEY THINK ANYONE CAN BETUM YEO BY ARGUMENT ON THAT IS IS A THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CASE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN THE MID TERMS WE PROBLY NEVER HAD A CIRCUMSTANCEIS MORE FAVORABLE FOR THE PARTY BIDIN WAS UNPOPULAR IN PLACION WAS HOT THE BORDER WAS A DISASTER CRIME ALL THESE ISSUES WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE T ANY REPUBLICAN WITH A PULSE SHOULD AVE BEEN ABLE TO WANT WHEN AND YET THE DAMOCRATS MADE IT A REFERANDUM A UNTROMP IN HIS A GASE IN CANDIDATE AND THERE'S JUST CERTAIN SWING VOTERS THAT THET JUST ARKET TN GO THERE AT THAT POINT  SO THE SANSIS AGAIN MAKING IN AGRESSIVE CASICAN TRUM NOW THE PROBLEM FOR THE SANTIST JUST IN TRMS THE PULLING DATA IS TET RIGHT DOWN THE PULLING DATA TRUMP DOES PRETTY WELL AGAINS JOBINN THIS HAS BEEN HE SINGLE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO DE SANTIS CAMPAIGN SINCE BASICALLY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO IN JANUARY TWENT TWENTY THRE THERE IS WIDESPREAD REPUBLICAN SENTIMENT THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS HE DRAG ON REPUBLICAN TICKETS HE PICK TO BUNCH OF BAD SENT AT CANDIDATE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO RACE THAT HADE LED TO THE REPUBLICAN LOST OF THE SENATE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWENTY OVIOUSLY HE LOST THE PRESIDENCY AND THEN HE PROCEEDED TO HELP LOSE TWO SEATS IN THE GEORGIA SEATS IN IN THE SENATE WHICH LED TO TRILLING TO DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL SPENDING THERE IS A FEELING LATE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO TRID REMEMBER ALL THEWAY BACK LEAAN TWENTY TWENTY TO AFTER THOSE BATTELECTION O REPUBLICANS THERE IS A FEELING THAT TRUMP WAS GOING TO DRAG DOWN THE TICKET AND SO HE NEDED SOMEBODY ELSE BUT THE SANTIS DID NOT JUMPIN IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE INSTEAD HE WAITED ALL THE WAIT UNTIL MAY OF TWENTIN TWENTY THREE AND BY DOING THAT HE BASICALLY A LOUD TRUMP TO DEFINE HIM BEFORE THE RACE EVEN BEGAN THAT'S IF YOU CAN WRITE THE RETROSPECTIVE OF THE CAMPAIGN BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN IS IS EVEN OVER AND WRIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE PULLING DATA FOR TRUMP RECOVERED AND THE PULLING DATA FOR BIDEN WENT DOWN IT NOW LOOKS LIKE TRUMP ITS CAM COMPETITIVE CAMPAIGNER AGAINS THOBIDN AND IN FACT HAS THE UPPER HAND IN MANY OF THESE POLES SO THAT IS THE SYSTEMAC PROBEM FOR TO SANSE NOW AGAIN WHAT IS H HAVE TO GET DONE TO NIGHT IN ORDER FOR HIM TO BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE CANDIDATE GOING FORD HE NEEDS A STRONG SECOND IF HE FINISH IS THIRD TWO NICKEY HAILEY I THINK THAT DE SANSIS RACE IS PROBABLY OVER AT THAT POINT BECAUSE AGAIN HE IS THEN GOING TO IT TAR TO SEE HIM PERFORMING WELL AN NEW HAMPSTR OR SOUTH CAROLINA IF HE LOSES IN IWA AND THERE'S NO SENSE OF SERIOUS MOMENTUM MEANWHILE MICKEY HAILEY IS NON SPENDING ANY TIME IN IWA AT THIS POINT WOR LE'S VERY MINIMAL TIME IN IWA AT THIS POINT SHE HAS HER EYE ON NEW HAMPSHIRE SHE'S ALREADY PUTTING ENORMOUS SUPPORT INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE BE CAUSE WHAT SHE'SE FIGURING IS IF I OUT PERFORM IN I WILL IT SAY THAT I FINISH SECOND IN IWA I WAS EXPECTED TO FINISH THIRD TWO TDESANTIS AMSTRUM AND I'M FINISHING SECOND IN IWA NI' MEW FORTU NE HAMPSHIRE AND I WIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WELL MAYBE THEN WE GO DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINAS I SAY AND WE OUT PERFORM IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THN A SORT OF A BATTLE TO THE FINISH POTTE NICKY HAILEY AND DONAL TRUM NOW THE PROBLEM FOR NICKEE HAILY IS THAT AS THE FIELD CONSOLIDATES FURTHER THAN IT DOES RIGHT NOW LET SAY TO SANTISTROPS OUT LAT' TOY THAT DE SANTIS LOSES I COMES IN THIRD DROPS OUT BECAUS HE HAS NO SHOT NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUT CAROLINA LOGOOD LHET SAY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THE SANSIS SUPPORT IS NOT IN A FLOTO HAILEY THE SANSIS SUPPORT IS MAINLY ON A FLOTED TRUMP SO GET TRUMP HAS THE UPPER HAND IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND BASICALLY SHOO'D HAVE TO SOMEHOW HIT A SEVEN TEN SPLIT AN BOWLING IN ORDER FOR HER TO WIN THE NOMINATION OF THIS POINT THIS IS WHY ALL THE SYSTEMIC FACTORS LINE UP IN FAVOR OF DONAL TRUMP IT'S ALSO WHY THE DEMOCRATS ARE STARTING TO PANIC OVERTLY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A DONAL TRUMP PRESIDENCY HEN SOME OF THAT PANIC IS MANIFESTING IN JUST ABSOLUTELY INSANE WAYS IS AN ARTICL FROM ENB SINEWS THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO A COO O CASO THAT IF THIS WERE EFFECTUATED SO ACCORDING TO ENB SENEWS QUOTE FEARS GROW THAT TRUMPWILL USE THE MILITARY IN DIC TRETORIAL WAYS IF HE RETURNS TO THE WHITE HOUSE THE PEOPLE THE ARE MENTIONING  FOR IT POSSIBLE DEFEN SECRETARYA CHRISTOPHER MILLER WHO SERVE TEMPORARILY DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION MICHAEL FLYN AND MIKE POMPEOSO FIRST OF ALL AN MICHAEL FLYN THERE AT FAIR NUMBER OF OF SERIOUS CHRETITES OF MICHAEL FLIN AS SOMEBODY LIKE TE SECRETARY DEFENSE BUT MIKE POMPEO WAS THE ATIONAL SECRETARY OF STATE UNDER DONAL TRUMP THE IDEA AND ALSO THE AD OF THE SE THE IDEA THAT MIKE POMPEO WOULD SOMEHOW BE A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECARITY A SECDAFF IS TOTALLY INSANE LIKE ABSOLUTELY WILD AND THE SAME THING BY THE WAY HOLDS THRUE OF  CHRISTOPHER MILLER A CHRISTOPHER MILLER WAS THE FORMER ACTING UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENDS HEAD SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL COUNTERETERORISM SENTER AS WELL SO THIS BAZARE IDEA THA CHRISOPHER MILLER WOULD BE LIKE A THREAT TO THE GOOD WORKING OR OF THE UNITED STATES OR THAT MIHE POMPEO WOULD BE THOUGHT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE BIZARE ACCUSATIONS AND YET YOU HAVE DEMOCRAT TO ARE ALREAY DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY ALREADY OF USING THE DEEP STATE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP SHOULD HE BECOME PRESET WHICH OF COURSE HELPS TRUMPY COMPRECIDEVEIS THE PART HE DEMOCRATS NG TOUNDERSTAND THE MORE YOU TALK ABOUT THE DICTATORIAL MEANS YOUARE GOING TO USE IF HE COMES PRESIDENT OR TO STOP HIM FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT THE MORE THAT ROCKS OLEDONAL TRUMPAYE IS GOING TO BE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT TO THE POLES AND VOTE AND THE THING THET DEMOCRATS REALLY NEETO UNDERSTAND IS THE BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY ALL THE RULES WERE DIFFERENT IT'S NOCK CIN A SHAKE DOWN THE SAME WAY THEY CHANGE THEY DID IN FACT CHANGE ALL OF THE VOTING RULES WHICH IS LI SIXTY PERCENT OF DEMOCRATS VOTED BY MAIL IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCEL COMPARE TOF THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF REPUBLICANS VOTING BY MAIL IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCEL THAT AIN'T GON ME THE

US MILITARY YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATIO OF AN OATH TWUPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH MEANS YOU ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES IF YOU THINK THAT THE MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN WHORE SERVING THE COUNTRY ARE SIMPLY GIM OBEY ANY PRESIDENT TWHO TELLS THEM TO DO ANY CRAZY THING THAT'S NOT HOW ANY OF THIS OR ANDAGAIN WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF THIS BECAUSE

FORMER OFFICIALS WORRIE TRUMPET INSTEAD SURROUND HIMSELF WITH LOYALISTS UNWILLING TO SAY NO NOW BRACING FOR TRUMP'S POTENTIAL RETURN A LOOSINIT NETWORK OF PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS AND LAWMAKERS IS QUIETLY DOVIZING PLANS TO TRY TO FOIL ANY EFFORTS TO EXPAND PRESIDENTIAL POWER WHICH COULD INCLUDE PRESSURING THE MILITARY TO CATER SO IS POLITICAL NEEDS THOSE TAKING PART IN THE EFFORT TOLD THEM BES

SPELLING OUT CONSEQUENCES IF THEY'D FACE IF THEY UNDER MINE CONSTITUTIONAL MORMS NOW AGAIN WRITING LETTERS TO MEMBERS THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT A COOA TEM BUT IF THERE IS AN ATTEMPT YO WEAPON IYES FOR

FROMS THE MOOD THIS FEELS LIKE A CHANGE ELECTIONS IS NOT FEEL LIKE A STAY THE COURSE ELECTION ACCORDING TO THE LATEST POLL FROM AXIOS FROM HARRIS SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT OF AMERICAN SAY THEY DON'T THINK THEIRE LEADERS CARE ABOUT THEM NOT A SINGLE GROUP REACHED FORTY  PER CENT RACE PARTY GENDER AGE INCOME GEOGRAPHIC REGION ZERO GROUPS REACHED FORTY PER CENT FORTY THREE PER CENT SAID THEIR LIVES ARE WORST UNDER BIDON VERS IS TWENTY NINE PERCENT WHO SAID THEY'RE BETTER TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT SAID UNCHANGED ONLY FIFTY THREE PER CENT OF DEMOCRAPS SAY THEY ARE BETTER OFF UNDER PRESIDENT BIDON THESE ARE AWFUL NUMBERS FOR JOBIDON BY THE WAY ACOS HAS ANOTHER PIECE SAYING THE BIDON IS RELUCTANT TO ACCEPTS HIS OLD AGE ACCORDING TO A JA YOU NOTICE THAT'S WHAT HE STILL ON THE BALLAT AND AGAIN HE IS FACING SYSTEMAC PROBLEMS TO HIS PRESIDENCY INCLUDING HIS OWN TERRIBLE POLICY ACCORDING TO THE WALLSTRY JOURNAL THEIRE SAYNG WHAT I BEEN SAING FOR MONTH WHICH THAT EVEN IF WE AVOID A RECESSION THE ECONOMY IS CAN BE IN SLOW GROWTH STAGNATION MODE FOUR THE FOR SEABLE FUTUR ACCORDIG TO THE WALLSTREY JOURNAL THE GOOD NEWS IS THE PROBABILITY OF RECESSION IS DOWN SHARPLY ACCORDING TO THE WALL STRE JOURNALS LATIST SURVEY OF ECONOMIS THE BAD NEWS THAT FOR LOT PEOPLE IT SILGAN A FEU LIKE RECESSION BUSINESS AN ACADEMIC ECONOMIST SURVEYED BY THE JOURNAL LOWER THE PROBABILITY OF RECESSION WITHIN THE LAST YE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR TO THIRDY NINE PER CENT FROM FORTY EIGHT PER CENT IN THEIR OCTOBER SURVEY BUT  ECONOMIST ON AVERAGE EXPECT THE ECONOMY TO GRO JUST ONE  PER CENT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAT IS HALF ITS NORMAL LONG RUN RATE A SIGNIFICANT SLOWING FROM THE ESTIMATED TWO PWOINT SIX PER CENT IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ASHEVE DAWAN AND ECONOMISTO GEORGI STATE UNIVERSITY SAYS THIS IS E LESS ORECESSION AND MORBA GROWTH STOP YE GROWTHSTOP IS NOT GLOOD AMERICAN EMPLOYERS SHOULD KEEP AUT ING JOBS AND TWENTY TWENTY FOR BET AT A MUCH SLOWER PLATE PACE THAN IN RECENT YEARS  ECONOMIST EXPECT PARELL GAIN TAVERAGE ONLY SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND MONTH THIS YEAR LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AVERAGE AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND FAR BELOW THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND AGAIN ONE OF THE REASONS THAT MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE GROWING ECONOMY ARE NOT CON N FEELICE TERE GROWING IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SYCLICAL CYCLICAL SECTORS THE ONES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THE ECONOMY GOING UP AND OUT ARE LIKELY TO STRUGGLE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WHICH ARE THE AREAS THAT HAVE GROWN ANDS FROMS OF AMERICAN EMPLOYMENT IS BEN LIKE HEALTH CANERET SOCIAL SISTANTS GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT THE SECTORS THAT ARE LEAST LIKELY TO SEE STRONG EM PLOYMENT GROWTH IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ACCORDING TO THESE ECONOMIS PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIFIC TEC SERVICES BY THE WAY THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GET INNOVATION THOSE ORE THE AREASWERE YOU GET THE THINGS THAT MAKE IN ECONOMY ACTUALLY GOOD MANUFACTURING SLOW GROWTH IN FORMATIONS SLOW GROWTH HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL ASSISTANCES NUMBER ON AY TH THESE ARE NOT GOOD NUMBERS FOR JOBIDE AND NOT ONLY THAT NOW I THINK THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER SERIOUS MAJOR CRISIS ON THE FOREGN POLICY FRONT IS VERY VERY HIGH RIGHT NOW ANDIS GIN TO GET HIGHER IF JOBIDON IS TRAILING IN THE PULSE COME THE SUMMER IF YOUR CHINA AND YOURE LOOKING AT A REPRODUCTION RATE OF POINT EIGHT AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT LITERALLY BLOWING UP EMPT HOTEL BUILDINGS THIT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW THEY SUNK ALL THEIR MIGHT THY BARD BUILLIONS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THE PLOUTIT INTO BUILDING EMPTY SKY SCRAPERS GO CITIES IN TE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND THEN THEY CONVINCED PEOPLE IN CHINA CONVINCED I WHICH ALWAYS HAS THE UNDER UNDER SCORING OF FORCE CONVINCE PEOPLE TO TAKE THEIR LIKESAVINGS AND PUT THEM IN THESE EMPTY APARTMENTS AND THE EMPTY APARTMENT ARE WITH ZERO DOLLARS AND CHINA BUILT ALL OF THOSE NOW IS BLOWING THEM UP TO CREATE ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY CHINAS ECHONOMY IS REALLY NOT IN FANTASTIC SHAPE CHINA HAS A BUNCH OF SERIOUS HE STEMIC PROBLEMS ONE THOSE BIKS ATEMIC PROBLEMS IS THAT THE LESS ACCESS THEY HAVE TO THE MODERN MILITARY TECNOLOGY AVAILABLE IN PIWAN FOR EXAMPLE THE LESS COMPETITIVE THEY ARE WITH THE UNITED STATES INCE THEY ARE FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND THE ONE THING THEY AVE GOING FOR THEM IS A PERCEPTION OF JOBIDON'S WEAKNESS IF WE GET TO JUNE JULY AUGUST AND JOBITON IS ERIOUSLY TRAILING INTHE PULS YOU COULD SEE CHINA MAKE THE DECISION THAT THEIR WINDOW IS NOW CLOSING AND THAT IF THEY DON'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW LIKE GOAFTER TIWAN RIGHT NOW AND DONAL TRUMP IS PRESIDENT IT'S ONG AN GO THE SAME WAY AS IT WOULD AS IF JOBIDON IS PRESIDE IN JOBIDEN HAS BEET EXTREMELY CONCILIATORY TOWAR GISIAN PING AND SO THEY MAY THING TO THEMSELVES OH KIN WE BETTER DO THIS NOW BEFORE JOBIDNS OUT OF OFFICE WHICH OF COURSE WOULD TURN THE ELECTION INTO A BLOW OUT IF WE'RE INTE MIDDLE OF A WAR WITH CHINA OR AT LEAST A A STAND OFF WITH CHINA OVER A BLOCKADE OF TIWAN THINGS TO GET REALLY EVEN MORE DICY FOR JOBIDONS REELECT EFFORTS THE VOTERS OF TIWAN FOR THEIM NOW HONESTLY GOOD FOR THEM THE VOTERS OF TIWAN HAVE MADE AT CLEAR TO CHINA THAT THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF APPEASING THEM ACCORDING TO ENBE SE NEWS OVER THE WEEK END VOTERS IN TIWANE ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT LICHINGT AS THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT ON SATURDAY TO FIND WARNINGS FROM BASHING NOT TO SUPPORT A CANSEDAT AN HAS CALLED A SEPARATIST AND Y TROUBLE MAKER THE ELECTION WHICH CHINA DESCRIBES DY CHOICE BETWEEN WAR AND PEACE COULD TESTRYS AN EFFORTS BY BASHING AND WASHINGTON PROPARELATIONS THAN AN RECENT YEARS HAVE FALLEN T THEIR LOWEST POINT IN VECADES LISES VICTORY EXTENDS THE EIGHT YEAR RULE OF DEMOCRATIC PROGRESSIVE PARTY WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE LEAST FRIENDLY PARTY TWO BASING RELATIONS BETWEEN TIWANA CHINA HAVE DETERIORATED UNDER PRESIDENT TI IN WEN WHOSE FIRT SELECTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND HIS LIMITED TO TWO TERMS VOTERS AND TIWAN WERE CONCER NOCHUS WITH CHINA BOTH ECONOMIC ISSUES LIKE UN EMPLOYMENT HOUSING CAUTS AN INCOME IN A QUOLITY LIE ONE WITH FORTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE COMPARED WITH THIRTY THREE PER CENT FOR WHO YE E OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY THE QUAUMAN TANG I'M S RM SCRIING UP THESE NAMES AN I APOLOGIZE IF SO BOTH THE OTHER PARTIES FAVORED CLOS TRO RELATIONS WITH BASING THE D TP THE D P P IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CONFRONTATIONAL SO IF YOU'RE CHINA YOURE LOOKING A MORE CONFRONTATIONALS I WANT AND FOR CHINA AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT A CONCILIATORY BIDE ADMINISTRATION THAT MAY BE LOSING TO DONAL TRUM THAT MAY BE A TIME THESE STARTS THINKING VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT ACCELERATING WHATEVER MILITARY PLANS YOU HAVE FOUR TI WAN MEANWHILE ONELEGAL IMIGRATION DEMOCRATS ARE COMPLETELY FALLING APART ON THE ONE HAND THEYE WON'T LAM THERE'S NO PROBLEM ON THE OTHER HAND THE N CLEM THERE'S A MASS OF PROBLEM CLAUSE BY REPUBLICANS SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE REPRESENT AM JASMAN CROCKER DEMOCRATE OF TECTASHING THERE IS NO ISSUE ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER HE WE GO SO I THINK PART OF THIS IS JUST THE FACT THAT THET REPUBLICANS HAVE NO OTHE RHETERIC BUT THE BORDER IVIOUSLY THEY ARE CONTINUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'VE NOT PAT BILLS THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO RUN ON AND SO IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO RUN ON THIS WRIP OF PEOPLE I WILL TELL YOU IT SOMEONE WHO IS THE TEXTAN I WHO DOES HAVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH BORDTOF PATROL YOU KNOW THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOBS I MEAN THAT BIG IS SU IS WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING OVER HERE TO INSINUATE THAT THERE IS THE SECURITY ISSUE I IN THE RALM OF THERE'S SO MUCH CRIME THAT'S GOING ON THET WERE NOT ABLE TO CAT I AUGHT I ACTUALLY HAVE TO TIP MY HAT OFF TO BORTER PATROL AND BORTER PATROL HAS AST US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE TECHNOLOGY SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE BETTER THE TEXTAN OF THOSE TAT IES THAT ARE TRYING TO GET OVER AND TRYING TO BRING THINGS OVER O HAT THIS IS WHILD I WAS JUST DOWN AT THE BOARDER TALKIN BORD PATROL AGENTS WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS NOT TRUE IT IS NOT A MATTER OF TECHNOLOGY IT IS MATTER OF STAFFING AND NOT WE NEN MORE STAFF WE NEED TO STOP USING STAFF IS A BUSSING INFARYING SERVICE FOR ELEGALIMIGRANS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY DEMOCRATS OF A REAL BORDER PROBLEM AND IF THEY KEEP PRETENDING THAT IS NOT A BORDER PROBLEM AND THEY KEEP TRYING WHEN PUBLICANS IES NOT CAN AND WELL FOR THEM AND MEANWHILE THE SITUATION OVER IN ISRAEL IS ALSO NOT FANTASTIC SO JOBIDN DOES NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL ON THE FOREIGN POLICYSIDE JUST HAS NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER WHICH IS WHY HE'S BEEN HITTING EMPTY SHACKS IN THE IDDLE OF NOWHERE APPARENTLY WITH REGARD TO YEMMEN AND THE HOOTHIES NOW HE NEEDS TO BE HITING N W THESE WHO THESE ARE OUR STOPPING LOBAL TRATING THEF HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE PRICE OF SHIPPING FOR EXAMPLE AND JOBIDN IS NOT IN FACT GOING IT ALONE HE HAS AN ENORMOUS COLITION OF PEOPLE INCLUTE RANGING FROM BAHERANE TO LIKE GERMANY AND FRANCE IN YOU CAT BUT JOBIDON HAS A PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT HE CREATED THIS PROBLEM BY BEING SOFTS ON RON IN THE FIRST PLACE TIS WHY OVER THE WEAKEND JOBIDING WAS CLAIMING THAT IT'S A RELEVANT WHETHER THE WHO THESE ARE DESIGNATED IS TERROUS WERD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT WIS RELEMANT THEY SEEM TO TAKE HIS D DESIGNATION OF THE WHO THESE IS TERRORIS WHICH WAS THE VERY FIRST MOVE HIS ADMINISTRATION MADE THEY SEEM TO TAKE THAT AS WEAKNESS AS ONE WOOD IN THE AT AE LEAST BECAUSE WEAKNESS IS IN FACT WEAKNESS HE HAR TER WHATR HO SO  YOU ATED MISTERO OFOTHETESE THE CEATION  E SAANTO ERECT VERY S THE THE RESPOND NOMACGINNUS WHYL HE'S HEIS HIS NOT WITH IT ANY MORE  MEANWHILE APPARENTLY JOBITDIN HIS RUNNING OUT OF PATIENS WITH BEBING ITS NOWHO NOW THAT THIS IS I GOTSI THIS I A RIDICULOUS THING THE REASONIN'S REDICULOUS BECAUSE ANY TIME YOU SEE THESE HEADLINES THEY'RE BEING LEAKED BY THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW BIDON IS RUNY MAN A BEBY BEEB IS NOT THE SOLE POWER IN THE ISRAILY GOVERNMENTS TAY IS JUST IGNORANT OF THE FACTS THERE IS A WAR CABINET IN ISRAEL IT INCLUDES THE OPPOSITION BENY GONS IT INCLUDESYOU OFE GOLANS WHOS TE DOFFENCEMINISTER THAT AR ONE POINT BE BE TRIED TO FIRE IT'S YOURE TALKING ABOUT A COALITION GOVERNMENT THAT WIDELY VARIES BY IT'S POLITICS AND YET THERE IS UNITY INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE WAR AGINST COMMOSS HAS TO CONTINU INTILL COMMASS IS NO LONGER A FUNCTIONAL POWER INSIDE THE GOS A STRIP AND YET APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO AXIOS JOBIDON AND OTHER SENIOR YOU US OFFICIALS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED WITH T E PRIMANINSTER NNTONOW WHO AN HIS REJECTION OF THE AD MINISTRATIONS MOST RECENT REQUEST RELATED TO THE WAR IN GAZA SO THE SITUATION SUXON WE ARE STUCK THE PRESIDENT'S PATIONTS IS RUNNING OUTS AD WON OU USS OFFICIAL AT EVERY JUNCTIR N INT TONOW WHO HAS GIVEN BITIN THE FINGERSON SENATOR CHRISVAN HOLLAN A MARLAN WHICH BY THE WIY IS A LIE THAT'S TOTALLY UNTRUE IF NITTING OW WHO HAD GIVEN BITN THE FINGER YARDYGUONE UP NORTH AND HITCUSBELLAP IF YHE'D IVEN BIDEN THE FINGER HEY WOULD NOT HAV STOPED THE AERIAL CAMPAIGN IS EARLY AS HE DID AND MOVED INTO GROUND OPERATIONS OR WITHDRAWN MILITARY RESERVES FROM THE FRONT LINES THAN NONE THAT WOULD HAPPEN THEYWOULD MOVE FASTER THE WOURD BROKEN MORE THINGS PRESUMABLY IF THEY'D SIMPLY WANTED TO TO DO WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO SUPPOSEDLY BY LEAT THIT'S GOING TO BIDN HIMSELF APPARENTLY BITON HASN'T SPOKEN I TO NOW WHO SINCE DECEMBER TWENTY THIRD BEFORE BIDON HUNG UP ON THAT CALL NITTING OW WHO HAS REJECTED HIS REQUEST THAT ISRAL RELEASE PALSTINIAN TAX REVENUES THAT IT IS CURRENTLY WITH HOLDING WHICH OF COURSE THEY SHOULDN'T WHY WHY WOULD YOU RELEASE TAX REVENUES TWO TERRORIST GROUPS WHICH IS WHAT THE PALISINIAN AUTHORITY IS THE ATTEMPT TO REABILITATE THE PALCINIAN AUTHORITY IN THE FACE O PALSONAND AUTHORITY LITERALLY PAYING TERRORS WHO MURDERS JUSE IS TOTALLY INSANE IN FACTS IN VIOLATION OF AMERICAN LAW THE TAILOR FORCE ACT IT'S ID'S TOTAL BUT THIS IS JOBIDON IN A NUTSHEL BY HE WAY THAT THE THE TENDER TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMOS SUPPORTERS AND MANY OF THEM VIOLENT COMMO SUPPORTERS IS TOTALLY INSANE INSIDE THE UNITED STATES SO FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE WEAKGAN PROTESTORS WERE OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY WERE LITEALLY TRYING TO BREAK DOWN WHITE HOUSE FENCES LOOK TEN OF INSURRECTIONY BUT APPARENTLY NO ONE NO ONE IS GON BE SERIOUSLY ARRESTED OR CHARGED WITH ANYTHING YOU IMAGION I THOGHT THIS IS BADEN INSURRECTION AND WHIT SUCH JANUARY SIX OUT THERE BREAK IT DOWN THERE SCREMING BREAK IT DOWN SO THAT  DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE IS IT THAT THAT'S THE WHITE HOUSE HOVDER THERE I THEN THREATENING THE WHITE HOUSE DON'T WORY THESE ARE JUST THE PEOPLE THAT JOBIDON CONSIDERS VERY VERY PASSIONATE IT IS AMAZING TO ME THAT WE ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE ISRAEL IS BEING AGAINST YOU KO THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT ACTUAL GENICIDE OF JUES WHOS SUPPORT THE WHO THES WHOSE SUPPORT HE SUPPRESSION OF WOMEN AND THE RAPE OF WOMEN AND THE MURDER OF CHILDREN II JUSTREMAINS A SOURCE OF UNENDING INSANITY TO ME IT'S IT'S JUST IT'S ABSOLEIN CREDIBLE BY THE WAY THERE IS AN UP DATE ONA THE MOST IT TID THIS STORIES WHILE SO YOU REMEMBER THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO A ME JOBIN LITERALLY SPOKE ABOUT THIS THERE IS A CASE WERE THREE ARAB MUSLEM STUDENTS FOR SHOT AND WOUNDED IN BURLINGTON FORMANT AND THE MEDIA TALKED ABOUT IT AS THE ALOMOPHOBIC CRIME OF THE CENTURY IN WHICH JOBINACTUALLY ISSUED A STATEMENT DECLARING THERE AS ABSOLEE NOPLACE FOR VIOLENCE OR HEAT IN AMERICA THIS GOING TO FROM PAGE MAG THE THREE MUSLEN MEN IDENTIFIED AS PALISTINIAN TWO OF THEM WERE IN CAPHEAS AND A COMOLA WAS IMPLYING T T THE SHUTER WAS CON QAT ANTIPALISTINIAN BURNEY STANDERS DID THE SAME THING AND IN FACT BURNIYTENDERS BLASTED ISRAEL O GATE THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR STORY APPARENTLY THE AMERICAN ARAB ANTO DISCRIMINATION COMITTE FALSELY CLAIM THE DEMAN SHOUTED IN HARASSED THE VICTIMS THAN PROCEEDED TO SHOOT THEM IF REASON TO BELIEVE THE SHOTINCURED BECAUSE OF THE VICTIM OUR ARAB IN REALITY THEY BEN SHOT BY LOCAL RESIDENT OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE WHO DIDN'T SAY A WORD THE THREE MUSLE MEN WERE RETURNING FROM O  OF HOME FROM A PARTY ON SATURAY NIGHT WHEN JAMES J ETON A LOCAL RESIDENT WITH A HISTORY OF MENTAL IN STABILITY STUMBLED OUT OF A WHITE CLAPPORT HOUSE ON THE RESIDENTIAL STREET AND WITHOUT A WORD FIRED FORESHOTS AT THE THREE MEN ETEN HAD BEEN DESCRIBED AS QUOTE THAT HIPPYGUY AND PROGRESSIVE AN ORGANIC FARMER WHOULD POSED A MEM WITH A DEFINITION OF AMERICA WITH THE CAY TAT CALED THAT THE WORST SENSE OF THE UNITED STATES I E IMPERIALISM CORRUPTION AND THE GLOBAL EXPORTATION OF AMERICAN CULTURE NOT ONLY THAT HE SUPPORTED A COMMAS ON DECEMBER SIXTH A LOCAL MEZAUTLET KNOWN FOR BREAKING STORIES ABOUT LOCAL POICH REVEALED ETEN HAD TOWEE TO QUOTE THE NOTION THAT HOMMASES EVIL FOR DEFENDING THEIR STATE FOM OCCUPATION IS ABSURD THEY ARE ODA STATE PAY UP TRESPONDING TO AN ARTICLE ABOUT A PROPOSED SEAS FIRE HE WROTE WHAT IF SOME ONE OCCUPIED YOUR COUNTRY WHEN YOU FIGHT THEM SO AGAN THIS WAS THE STORY THAT BE MADE NATIONAL NEWS TBECAUSE IN AN EFFORT TO EQUATE ANTISEMITISM WITH HIS LOMOPHOBIA IT HAD TO BE PROJECTED THAT SOMEHOW BEING PRO ISRAEL MEANS THAT IGNINGLIS SHOOT PALISTINIANS IN THE SAME WAY THAT BEING PROPALISTINIAN RIGHT NOW MEANS BEING PROCOMAS THAT SEPARATION IN DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW BECAUS IF YOURE SUPPORTING A SEASE FIRE AGAINST COMAS A TERROR SCROUP THAT CONTINUES TO FIRE ROKETS INTO ISRAEL THAT'S CONTINUING TO HIGJACK AN STEEL HUMANITARIAN AT AGAIN THIS IS ALL OVER OMORROW IF COMAS RELEASES THE HOSTAGES AND SURRENDERS THERE DOING NONE OF THOSE THINGS AND YET JOBIDON STILL CONTINUES TO PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE EVEN'S LOBAL ANTISEMITISM GETS WORSE OUT OF TURKEY A STORY THAT IN IS REALLY SOKAR STAR HE A SCORED AGOLL AND THEN HE HELD OUT HIS HAND AND ON HIS HAND WAS WRITTEN A MESSAGE OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE HOSTAGES HE WAS PROMPTLY ARRESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY THE CLUB UT PROMP PROMPTLY SUSPENDED HIM AND NOWIS GAN TO BE SHIPPED BACK TO ISRAEL FOR TH GREAT CRIME OF NOTICING THAT COMAS IS CURRENTLY HOLDING HOSTAGES SO YOUT THE WORLD SITUATION GOTS WORSONS FROM HIS VENTISEMITISM IN MEANWHILE BITNE IS RUNNING OT O PATIONS NOT WITH THE TERRORIS APPARENTLY BUT WITH TI TINOW AMAZING AMAZING STUFF SAME THINGS HAPPENING ACR S THE WEST BY THE WAY OW THERE IS A A PERSON WHO WAS GIVEN A TITLE AS ONE OF THE ONE HUNDRED MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY TIME MAGAZINE HIS NAME IS MOHAMMED EL KURRD AND HE IS A RADICAL MUSLEM WHO LIVES IN EAST

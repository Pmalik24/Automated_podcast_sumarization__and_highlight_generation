RIGHT NOW THE UNITED STATES EXPERIENCING THE BIGGEST BORDER CRISIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND I'M LOOKING AT THE FRONT PAGES OF THE BIGGEST NEWSPAPERS IN THE UNITED STATES RAH NOW AND NONE OF THEM ARE EVEN COVERING IT THE TOP HEAD LINES OVER AT THE WASHINGTON POST ARE ALL ABOUT A OU EN CORT WHICH IS ENTIRELY IRRELEVANT ORDERING ISRAEL TO DO MORD PRINT HARM IN THE GOZAS STRIP OR AN ALIBAMA MAN BEING PUT TO DEATH WITH NITROGEN GAS NOTHING ABOUT THE GIANT WAVE FTHE LEGAL MEGRATION ON A BORDER THAT IS NOW SPURRING A CONSTITUTIONAL SHOW DOWN BETWEEN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND BY HE WAY TWENTY FOUR OTHER STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAME THING OVER AT THE YOR TIMES NOTHING AT THE TOP OF THE HOME PAGE NOTHING ON WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE BORDER WHY BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEIRE LACKEYS IN THE PRESS THEY MUST COVER UP WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER BECAUSE IF AMERICANS UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER JOBIDON WILL NOT BE REELECTED IT IS THAT SIMPLE WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER IS A TRAVESTY SO AS I MENTIONED TO YOU IF MENTIONING TOOU FOR A FEW WEEKS HERE NEAR THE BEGINING OF JANUARY WE ASSHUE WENT DOWN TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN ARIZONA AND IT IS ABSOLLUTELY STUNNING WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER NOT MERELY THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE OR SHOWING UP AT PORTS OF ENTRY AND THEN BEING CAUGHT AND RELEASED TCATCHIN RELEASEIS WHERE YOU CLAIM ASYLUM THEY BRING YOU IN THE PROCESS YOU THERE ARE NO BEDS FOR DETENTION FACILITIES AND THY'RE NOT GOINGTO DETAIN YOU ANYWAY TO COMING WITH THE KID FOR VERY LONG SO INSTEAD THEY JUST RELEASE YOU INTO THE INTERIOR WITH A COME BACK LATER DATE WHICH NOBODY EVER DOES IS NOT JUST THAT IS THAT THE DRUG CARTELS ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER THETVE A DOCUMENTARY THAT IS NOW AVAILABLE AT DAILY WIRE PLUSS THAT SHOWS YOU EVERYTHING THAT WE SAW AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER WE TOOK A GIANT TOUR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN ARIZONA WITH BRAND AND JUD WHO IS IN FACT THE HEAD OF THE BORDER PATROL OFFICERS UNION AND IT IS ASTONISHING BECAUSE AGAIN NOT ONLY IS THE SOUTHERN BORDER LARGELY UNDEFENDED IT IS MADE SO BY THIS ADMINISTRATION THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED THAT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IS TURN C B P INTO A BOSSING AND PROCESSING SERVICE THERE EFFECTIVELY THE D M B ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER FOR ELEGALIIGRANTS WHAT YU'E IN A C IN THES DOCUMENTRY WHEN Y UGOVER TO DAILYWIRE PLUSS ONE O THE THINGS THT YOUARE GOING TO S IS A SIN THAT IS AT THE SOUTHERN BOARDER THAT LITERALLY SAYS TWO E LEGALIMIGRANS IN SPANISH PUSH THIS BUTTON FOR BOARDER PATROL HELP THIS IS OVER AT THE SAND MAGEL GATE IN ARIZONA WHICH IS ACTUALLY ON A NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATION RIGHT AT THE BORDER THERE IS NO BOARDER WALL OVER THERE BECAUSE THE NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATION IS NOT WANT A BORDER WALL OVER THIS CAN LITERALLY JUST STEP OVER THE BORDER WALK IN A MEXICO WALK BACK ACROSS THE BORDER INTO THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE ARE ARRIVING ON MASS DROPPED OFF BY DRUG CARTELLS DRUG CARTELLS ARE LITERALLY TAKING TRUCKS FILLED WITH THE LEGALIMIGRANS AND THEYARE DRIVING THEM YARDS FROM THE BORDER DROPPING THEM OFF HAVIN'G PEOPLE WALK ACROSS BECAUSE OF JOBIDONS ASYLUM POLICIES WICH ARE DIFFERENT THAN DONAL TRUMPS ASYLUM POLICIES PEOPLE ARE THROWING UP THEIR HANDS SURRENDERING TO BORDER PATROL BOR PATROL IS THEN LETTING THEM INTO THE COUNTRY THAT'S WHAT CATCH AND RELEASE IS AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR SOME ESTIMATES LOW END ESTIMATES SAY SIX MILLION Y LEGALEMIGRANTSHAVE ENTURED THE UNITED STATES SINCE JOBIDON TOOK OFFICE HIGH AND ESTIMATES PUT THAT NUMBER ALL WA UP AT AN MILLION ILLEGAL MIGRANTS AND I'S NOT JUST THAT BECAUSE THE DRUG CAR TELLS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YO BIDON HAS DONE THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY DECIDED TO USE THIS ASYLUM PROCESS NOT ONLY TO SMUGGLE MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE BORDER BECAUSE DOESN'T REQUIRE VERY MUCH LITERALLY JUST DROP SOMEBODY OFF AT THE BORDER THAT TEY MENT I WOULD DROP MA HIDS OFF AT SCHOOL THEY DON'T JUST DO THAT THEY FLOOD THESE PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE BORDER BORDER PATROL THAN HAS A LEGAL DUTY TO HELP PROCESS ALL OF THESE PEOPLE AND AS WE SHOW IN THE DOCUMENTORY THIS MEANS LARGE SWAVES OF THEBORDER THAN UN

PROCESSING WOR WHERE THEY TAKE BASIC IN FORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE EILLEGAL EMIGRANS OUR COMING ACROSS THE BORDER WITH PHONE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN VARIOUS CITIES THEY WISH TO VISIT WE LITERALLY HAVE ON TAPE SHEETS OF PAPER WITH FPHONE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN DENVER IN ATLANTA IN HUSTON THEY THE ENTIRE DESERT IS COVERED IN TRASH OVER THERE TRASH LEFT BY ILLEGAL EMIGRANTS OR CROSSING THAT DUESER TO GET IN AND AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE DRUG CARTELLS ARE GETING PAID FOR THE ILLEGAL EMIGRANTS THAT THEY SMUGGLE IN AT THE BORDER IT'S THE DRUG CARTELLS OUR TRYING TO GATHER BORDER PATROL AGENTS TO THE PROCESSING FACILITIES AND AWAY FROM GUARDING THE BORDER SO THAT THE REALLY DANGEROUS PEOPLE NOT JUST THE ILLEGAL IMIGRANS WANT TO COME HERE AND WHO WANT A WORK SOME ONE BEUN WELL FOR WERE TUNGUE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTIVELY DANGEROUS PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS PEOPLE WHO ARE TERRORISTS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SMUGGLE DRUGS INTO THE COUNTRY WHEN THE BORDERIS UN PROTECTED THAT'S WHEN THESE PEOPLE

ELEVATE THAT ALL THE WAY TO THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAN SECURY TO GET PERMISSION SHIIT TAT DOWN THAT'S WHAT JOBITON HAS DONE ON OUR BORD HE HAS TURNED OUR BORDER PATROL AGENTS INTO EITHER SITTING DUCKS OR FACILITATION AGENTS FOR ILLEGAL EMIGRAGENT AND THAT IS WHY F THE STATE OF TEXAS IS NOW SAYING TO NO WE ARE GOING TO EN FORCE THE BORDER EGET TO MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST IF YOU'RE LIKE

AMERICAN BOARDER ONE OF THE PROBIS OF THE TRUM BORDER WALL WHICH AGAIN IS A GREAT THING THE BORDERWALL IS VERY USEFUL EXCEPT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE TO GUARD THE BOARDER WALL SO THAT ELEGALIMIGRANS AND DRUG CAR TAMEMBERS DON'T ACTUALLY JUST SOTER DIRECTLY THROUGH THE THE BOARDER PATROL WALL E GET YOU SAW EVIDENCE OF THIS GEN IN THAT OCUMENTRY YOU WILL SEE SECTIONS OF THE WALL THET 'VE BEN COMPLETELY CUT THROUGH CUT THROUGH BY THE DRUG CARTELLS ISO BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TAT IS AMAZING TRULY AMAZING IS AGAIN THAT NOT ONLY WOULD TEXAS HAVE TO BUILD MORE IM PETIMENTS THERE TEXAS WOULD SOMEHOW HAVE TO COME UP WITH A MECHANISM FOR EXPELLING PEOPLE BACK SOUTH OF THE BOARDER AND THAT SOMETHING THE TEXAS HAS NOT DONE YET NOT ONLY THAT EVEN IF TEXAS WERE TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF JO BITONS ASYLUM POLICY ALL THAT WOULD DO ITS THEN FOCAS ALL THE REST OF THE LEGALIMIGRATION AT PORTS OF ENTRY WERE PEOPLE WOULD STILL CLAM ASYLUM TOY'D BE BETTER THAN OCCURRENTLY IS WHERE HERE'S

WHELE WE WERE DOWN AT THE SAMMAEL GEIGHT IN TELVIS HAPPENING WHY TBECAUSE THE DAY THAT WE'RE DOWN OF THE SANMAGELL GATE WHICH WAS AGAIN EARLY JANUARY THERE WASN'T A LOT OF EELEGAL IMIGRATION THAT DAY WHY BECAUSE THE DRUG CAR TELLS WERE BUSY HAVING A FIRE FIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY'RE TOO BUSY KILLING EACH OTHER TO ACTUALLY BRING PEOPLE UP TO THE BOARDER  THAT DAY THE DRUGCAR TLLS ARE CIN COMPLETE CONTROL DOWN THERE TE'E IN COMPLETE CONTROL AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE SAYING THIS THIS IS AIGHT THIS T JO BIDON POLICY THIS DID NOT EXIST ON ER DONAL TROMPTONAL TRUMP

BROCH WHOSE AN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THDIRECTORD OF INTELLIGENCE AT THE F B I AT THE NATIOENAL COUNTERTERRISM CENTERE ALSO RETIRED AN WHAT THEY POINT OUT AND THEY ARE TOTALLY RIGHT IS THAT THIS IS A MASSIVE NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT THEY SAY HAS FORMER SENIOR EXECUTIVES OF THE F B I WITH DEEP EXPERIENCE COMBATING DANGEROUS TO THE NATION WE RIGHT TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERN ABOUT A CURRENT SPECIFIC THREAT THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS EVER TO MENACE THE UNITED STATES THE DANGER ARISES FROM THE NATURE OF THE THREAT ITSELF WARS ANT EXPIONOTION BOMMINGTON RIOTS ARE SADLY FAMILIAR DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF INSTABILITY INTOMIDATION AND INSECURITY THE COUNTRY HAS FACE THESE AND MORE THROUGHOUT ITS SISTER AND IS HELD TOGETHER THE NOT WITHOUT STRUGGLE THAT THROUT WE CALL OUT TODAY IS NEW AND UN FAMILIAR AND IT'S MODERN HISTORY THE UNITED STATES IS NEVER SUFFER AND INVASION OF THE HOME LEND AND YET ONE IS NFOLDING RIGHT NOW MILITARY AGED MEN FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE UT MANY FROM REGIONS OR COUNTRIES NOT FRIENDLY TO THE UNITED STATES ARE LANDING IN WAVES ON OUR SOIL BY THE THOUSANDS YOU' BE DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE THE DANGER REPRESENTED BY THE PRESEN S INSIDE OUR BOARDERS OF WHAT IS A COMPARATIVELY MULTID VISEN ARMY OF SINGLE YOUNG DULT MAILS FROM HOSTILE NATIONS AND REGIONS WHOSE BACKGROUND INTEND OR ALLEGIANCE IS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY SAY THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE CROSSING THE PORUS SOUTHERN BORDER STARTED TO SHIFT YOUNG MEN FROM AROUND THE WORLD TRAVELLING ALONE AND HOLDING QUESTIONABLE MOTIVATIONS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED IN NUMBER TO BECOME THE MOST COMMON PROFILE OF THOSE BREGIONG THE NATIONS O BORDERS THIS HAPPENS TO BE TRUE BY THE WAY WE'RE TOLD BY BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS THAT THE NUMBER OF TERRORS WO ARE BEING CAPTURED AT THE BORDER IS COMPLETELY UNSPECIFIED THEY HAVE NO IDEA EVEN WHEN SOMEBODY HAS CAUGHT ON THE TERROR WATCHLIST THAT DOESN'T ECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE PERSON IS A TERRORIST BECAUSE THE TERR WATCHLESS IS REALLY REALLY VAY IT'S THE UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS THAT ARE TRULY DANGEROUS WHENEVER WE LOOK AT THE STATS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDERY HIVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE BEING AGGREGATED TOGETHER ONE IS BORDER APPREHENSIONS TO BORDER APPREHENSION BY THE WAY TDOES NOT MEAN THE PERSON IS KICK BACK TO MEXICO A BORDER APPREHENSION OR A BORDER IN COUNTER MEANS THE PERSON IT'S TAKEN BY C B P AND THEN PROCESS WHICH MEANS THEY END UP IN THE COUNTRY THE VASMAJORITY OF THE TIME UNDER JOBIDON IF THEY KNOW THE MAGIC WORDS IF THEY SAY OPEN SESSAME I WANT ASYLUM I FEAR TO GO BACK

WORKY LEGALLE AND THEN HOPE FOR AMNESTY ET SOME POIN THEM ON TO COME HER O GET MARRIED TO PLIT FOR GREEN CARD HEY WN TO COME HERE BEYOND WELLFARE IN  IN CALIFORNIA WAREVER IF THEY WANTED ALL OF THAT THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT IS DOU THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND SURRENDER TO C B P THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CROSSING AS UNKNOWN GODAWAYS OURE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT BE IN THE COUNTRY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY'E ARE LEGLIMIGRANS BUT BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS O DRUG CONNECTIONS AT A MINNIMUM AND MANY OF THEM PROBABLY HAVE TERROR CONNECTIONS AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE AVOIDING C B P IT'S ONE THING BACK IN THE OLDEN DAYS WHEN C B P WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO STOP EVERYONE FROM CROSSING THE BORDER  TO SAY THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE ARE CROSSING THE BORDER BETWEEN PORTS OF ENTRY AND TRYING TO EVADE BORDER R PATROL THOSE PEOPLE ARE ARE  NOT CRIMINALS IN IN THE SENSE OF ANYTHING EXCEPT FORE THE ILLEGAL MOGRATION THAND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE YOU NOW THE PEOPLE WHO PROVERBRIALLY WORK IN THE FIELDS OR DO THE CLEANING OR WHATEVER THE LEFT WANTS TO SAY THEIR IMPORTANT FOR BECAUE THE LEFT IS VERY RACUS WITH REHARDTOLOUT OF THSE PEOPLE BUT WITH THAT SAD NOW THAT IT IS VERY OBVIOUS THAT YOU CAN SURRENDER TO BORDER PATROL AND THEN MOVE TO HUSTON OR GOOD WOOD LANTOP OR GO TO COLORADO OR WHATEVER THE ONLY PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO EVADE THE BORDER PATROL ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESUMABLY DANGEROUS AND THAT AMOUNTS TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE YEAR BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING BY HE WAY THE DRUGCAR TELLS NOTHIS THE DRUGCAR TELLS NO THIS SOMEOF THE MOST SHOCKING FOOTAGE FROM THE DOCUMENTARY THAT WE JUST PUT OUT AT DAILY WIREPLOSS AND GANY SHOULD GO CHECK IT OUT BIES REALLY IS SHOCKING STUFF S B P TOLD US THAT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT THE DRUGCAR TELLS DO FOR EXAMPLE IS THEY LITERALLY IF THEY'RE BEING CHASE BY SB P AND THEY ARE TRAVELLING WITH CHILDREN THEY WILL LITERALLY DISCARD THE CHILDREN WERE TONG ABOUT BABIES COME OUT BABIES THE TOBLERS OR SMALLER DISCARD THE CHILDREN HOPING THAT S B P WELL GO AND CARE FOR THE CHILDREN AS THEY ARE MORALLY DUTY BALND TO DO SO THEY CAN EVADE A REST STOLL LITERALLY TAKE HUMAN BABIES AND THROW THEM TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT SEBY PIECE THAT CAN ESCAPE INTO THE INTER OF THE COUNTRY THY'VE NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE THE DRUGARE TELLS NONE AND THIS BEING AGAIN FACILITATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO AS THESE FORMER AFTBII AGEANT SAY ALL OF THIS IS PARTICULARLY ALARMING AND LIGHT OF TH COMMOSS TEROR ATTACK ON IS REA LAST OCTOBER SEVEN THOSE WHASE WHO HAVE FOUGHT TERRORS WHOM KNOW THAT HISTORICALLY SUCCESSFUL TERRATTAX IN VITE MIMICRY WE KNOW AS WELL THET TERROR LEADERS INTENTIONALLY CULTIVATE THE LONGS OF YOUNG MEN POSSESSING A CERTAIN EASILY MANIPULATED PERSONALITY TYPE TO CARRY OUT ATROCITIES IN TE STARK TO SAY SO BUT HAVING A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG MAILS NOW WITHIN OUR BORDERS WHO COULD BEGIN ATTACK AND GATHERING SOM UNARMED CITIZENS AND IMITATION OF TEN SEVEN MUST BE CONSIDERED INSTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT OF COURSE MAKES PERFECENTS AND WHAT WE ARE WATCHING WRIGHT NOW IS ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED ON OUR SOUTHRN BORDER AND THE MEDIA HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT THE ONLY THING MEDIA CAN DO IS YELL A REPUBLICANS JO BIDON HAS THE LEGAL POWER TO CLOSE THE BORDER TO DAY NO FURTHER LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY JOBIDON CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT DONAL TRUMPTED JO BIDON CAN REINTERPRET THE ASYLUM LAWS TO REQUIRE THT YOU MAKE A COLORABLE SHOWING THAT YOU WILL IN FACT RECEIVE ASYLUM BEFORE YOUR RELEASIIN OF THE COUNTRY JOBIDON CAN DETAIN PEOPLE AND SHOULD DETAIN PEOPLE

ACTUALLY GOT MORE RIGHT WING ON ANYTHING MY ENTIRE LIFE IN FACT THEY'VE GOTTEN MORE LEFT WING ON WIDE VRIETY OF ISSUES RANGING FROM SAY GAME MARRIAGE TWO THINGS LIKE FEDERAL SPENDING THE ONLY AREA WHERE THEY SEEMS TO VE EVEN HELD THE LINE IS ON EMIGRATION DEMOCRASTS ARE THE ONE WHO HAVE HAD AN ASYMETRIC POLARISATION THEM CN RADICALLY THE LEFT ON EVERY ISSUE HERE IS A PERSON YOU MIGHT RECALL FROM WHEN HE WAS SENTIENS JOBIDEN TALKING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FOUT SANCTUARY CITIES WOULD YOU ALOW THESE CITYE TO IGNORE THE FEDERAL LAW REGARDING THE REPORTING OF ILLEGAL EMIGRANTS AND IN FACT PROVIDE SANCTUARY TO THESE EMIGRANTS THE REASON THE CITIES IGNORE THE FEDERAL LAW IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO FUNDING AN THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE FOR THE KIND OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE FEDERAL LEVEL YOU NEED PICK UP THE NEW YORK TIMES ADAY THERE'S A CITY NOT FAR ACROSS THE RIVER FROR MY STATE THAT IMPOSE THA SIMILAR SANCTIONS AND WHAT THEY FOUND OUT IS AS A CONSEQUENTS OF THAT THEIR CITY WEN THE DUMPS IN THE DUMSTER STORE STARTED CLOSING EVERYTHING STARTED TOHAPPENAND THEY CHANGE THE POLICY PART OF THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT CAN NFORCE LAWS THIS ADMINISTRATIONS ENFUNDAMENTALLY DERLIC IN NOT FUNDING ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS ARE NETY EVEN ENFORCE THE EXISTEN TENTER BI YESSING OUT WHICH YOU ALLOW THE CITIES TO IGNORE THE FEDERAL LAW NO O GET THAT IS JOBIDAN BACK WHEN AGAIN HE'S A SENTIEN PERSON BY WAY THE A AMAZING CONTRAST BETWEEN JOBIDAN SPEAKING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN NOT JUST ONE POLICY AND JOBIDENSPING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FORTS ASTONISHING YOU WATCH THAT BACK TO BACK WITH JOBIDAN SPEAKING NOW THIS IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY THE SAME HUMAN BEING A TRULY'S AN AMAZING THON WILL GET TO JOBIDON AN THE FACT THAT HE IS LIKE BREAKING DOWN IN REAL TIME IN A LITTLE BIT HERE BUT THAT'S HOW FAR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS MOVED THEY'VE MOVED JUST THAT FAR IT IS TRULY AMAZING SO MUCH SO THAT H TOP ICE OFFICIAL NAN PATRICK LIKE LIGHTNER ACTUALLY HAD HIS CHIEF OF STAFF MEAT WITH A BOBLISH BORDER'S ACTVESS ANDTHN HAD TO DEFEND THAT THE OTHER DAY HERE WE GO SO I'M WONDERING WHY THE ISHET OF SA TAT WITHAN ABOLISHED BORTER IS ACTOF TIS EARLIAR THIS WEEK COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS THAT COUNTER ICES MISSAN O THATS IS VERWER O OT ALL SO YAO STAF  IRE SO RE ARY YE MEE WIT MA AR A YOU SA A  YE ERAL STENS WERE MIS FOS AND R ININO   AAI  TAT NOT A OE WI VARY FORIATION ER WORE AA RES ORERITIN WOE LEEOR RY IS ATEDO HE  REARBYAL R UM THAT'S RIDICULOUS I'M SORRY ABOLISH BORTS ACTIVES DO NOT NEED BE MEETING WITH ICE THEY DON'T NEED ME ME WITH THEIR PARTNEFHOM TAT'S CARRY THE'R LITERALLY THEIR GOAL IS TO IGNORE THE LAW AND EVICERATE THE LAW AGAIN ONE OF THINGS WE SAW DOWN AT THE BORDER WHEN WE'RE IN  IN ARIZONA SIGNS OF SO CALLED HUMANITARIAN GROUPS LITERALLY DIRECTING ILLEGAL IMIGRANTS AWAVE FROM LAW ENFORSEMENT PEOPLE LEAVING IN THE DASART BOTTLES OF WATER BY THE WAY NOT BY THE PORTS OF ENTRY NOT BY THE PLACES WHERE ONLY THE SORT OF CIVILLION ILLEGAL IMIGRANTS ARE GOING A CRIMINAL PLACE WORK CRIMINALLY ELEGALIMIGRANTS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE ACTUALLY GETTING THOSE BOTTLES OF WATER AS THEY RUN INTO THE COUNTRY AGAIN NOBODY WANTS PEOPLE TO SUFFER NOBODY IS SUGGESTING ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT BUT IF YOU WANT A FACILITATE HUMAN SUFFERING LET THE DRUG CRAR TELLS CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY ARE DOING THE EARNING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE YEAR THE  ILLEGAL IMIGRATION AND DRUG SMUGGLING AT THESE BORDERS IT'S A DEMOCRATS HAVE NOW BEEN LEFT WITH A FINAL ATTEMPTO MOVE HERE BEFORE THEY HAVE TO CAVE ON THIS THING AND THAT IS THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO PRETEND THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO COMPROMISE ON THE BORDER WHEN THEY REALLY ARE NOT AND THERE SOME REPUBLICANS WO ARE WILLING TO HELP THEM OUT IN THIS MIT ROMNY BEING THE MOST PROMINENT AMONG THEM  SO HERE IS COMA HARRIS MAKING THIS CASE SHE SAYS THAT HERE'S A CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATION GOING ON IT'S BEN GOING ON FROMONTS OF THIS POINT IT'S A CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATION OVER ONE HUNDRED FIVE BILLIEN DOLLAR BILL THAT WILL PROVIDE SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS IN AIDS YU CRANE MILITARY ADSU CRANE SOME FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY AID TO ISRAEL LITTLE BUT MILITARY AID TO  TIWAN AND SOME BORDER MONEY THE PROBLIM IS THAT ALL OF THE PROVISIONS ON THE BORDER ARE REALLY REALLY SOFT AS ANIMAC CARTHY HAS POINTED OUT THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE HAVE NEGOTIATED A TRULY BAD PIECE OF LEGISLATION ACCORDING TO MAC CARTHY'S BACK IN DESEMBER HE SAYS WHAT'S REPORTEDLY BEING DISCUSSE IS A TRIGGERING MECHANISM THAT WULD EMPOWER GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO CLOSE THE BORDER TO ILLEGAL IMIGRANTS NOW SU PRISINGLY DEMOCRATS DO NOT WANT BORDER CLOSES ARE TRIGGERD UNTIL FIVE THOUSAND ALIENS HAVE CROSS THITS THAT'S ON AVERAGE DAY FIVE THOUSAND NEW LEGLIMIGRANS A DAY THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRATS WERE LOOKING FOR IN THIS NEGOTIATION REPUBLICANS HAVE SIGNAL TEY WOULD AGREE TO THREE THOUSAND BORDER CROSSINGS A DAY HEM YUE TO POINT OUT OF THIS POINT THREE THOUSAND BORDER CROSSING TO DAYWOULD BE ONE POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR THAT SO REPUBLICANS WERE SEEKING TO DO AS THEY COMPROMISE WITH DEMOCRATS NOW AGAIN JOBINE DOES NOT NEED THES SIONALL AUTHORITYY  OF THIS GORBITN OULD DO IT TO DAY GERBION COULD SIMPLY DECLARE THAT HE IS GOING TO PURSUE IT REMAIN IN MEXICAL POLICY THAT EVERYONE ACROSS O THE BORDER WILL BE DETAINED UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A DAIT IN CORT NO MATTER HOW LONG THAT TAKES HE CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS HE IS NOT DOING ANY OF THOSE THINGS AN THESE THAT THESE REPUBLICANS HAVE NOT PURSUIT THAT THE STUFF THE DEMOCRATS AR UNWILLING TO SIGN OFF ON INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THAT IF SOMEBODY SHOWS UP AT THE BORDER AND CLAIMS SYLUM THEY HAVE TO SHOW BY A PROPONDERANCS OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY ACTUALLY WILL GET ASYLUM OTHERWISE THEY'LL BE IMMEDIATELY DEPORTED NOW IT SEEMS PERFECTLY REAS SINTABLE TO ME YOU'RE MAKING ACQUAINT FOR ASYLUM IT SHOULDN'T BE ENOUGH FOR YOU JUST TO SAY I CLAIM ASYLUM WOO LIKE MICHAOLD SCOTT WALKING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE OFFICIN TOE CLEARING BANKRUPTSY YETS TO SHOW SOME ACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT YOU REQUIRE ASYLUM AND BY THE WAY SHOULD BE POINT TED OUT OF THIS POINT THERE IS NO CORTIN WUAT RIGHT TO ASYLUM THAT IS NOT E THING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS THE POWER TO DECLARE WHO CAN GET ASYLUM IN WHO CANNOT GET ASYLUM THERE'S NO UNSPECIFIED RIGHT THAT ATTACHES TO FOREIGN CITIZENS OF OTHER COUNTRIES WE SIMPLY DECLARE THINGS WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE IN ANYCASE YOURE AS COMLA HERRIS PRETENDING THAT BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT CAVING ON THIS BORDER DEAL IT'S REPUBLICANS FAL THAT THE BORDER IS OPEN JOBIDON COULD CLOSE IT TO DAY THE FIRST BILL THAT WE OFFERED WAS A BILL TO FIX THE EMIGRATION SISTEM AND THAT'S WHY AN'T CANTRALL BOUT HOWLIES AND CONGRESS DID NOT TAKE IT UP AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS FIRST OF AL ON IN INLISTION BUT BUT SADLY IT HAS BECOME SO DEEPLY PARTISEN AND THE SUBJECT OF THEN POLITICAL GAMESMENSIIP WHEN IN FACT THE SOLUTIONS ARE AT HAND AND WE ARE FOR TO SOLUTION EARLY ON AND INVITED BY PARTISAN WORK LET'S WORK ON IT TO FIX THIS AND IN FACT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW A PROPOSAL FOR FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN PUT MORE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THI VERY SITUATION AND ON WE HOPIN AND AND AND ARE REALLY TRYING TO COMPEL IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS AND CONGRESS TO PARTICIPATE AN THE SOLUTION BUT SADLY IYOU KNOW WE WANT O FIX IT THEY WANT O RUN ON IT NO YOU YOU DON'T WANT FIX YOU WANT TO OPEN THE SPIGET WIDE THEY WANT MORE FUNDING FOR THE BORDER WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT THEY WANT MORE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES TO ALLOW PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY MORE EASILY AND MORE RESOURCES AT THE BORDER PATROL STATIONS FOR DETENTION PROCESSING THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT THEY DON'T WANT MORE RESOURCES ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER SO WE CAN ACTUL GUARD THE SOUTHERN BORDER FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOT WHA THEY WANT BUT NATURALLYOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MARAMNI WHO ARE DOING THE BIDING OF DEMOCRATS ON THE SORT OF STUFF HERES MARAMNI WHO HAS NOT YET ACTUALLY LEFT THE SENATE HE NEDS TO GO NOW ENOUGH SAYING THAT IT'S REALLY BECAUSE DONAL TRUMP IS LAWBEING AGAINST THE BILL THAT THE BILL IS DOING IF THE BILL WERE GOOD THEY'D BE ONE THING BUT TH BILL IS NOT GOOD I BE IN FAVOR OF

PRINTYSTRONG FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE IN NOT DECLINE IN ELDERLY AGE FOR IM FOR JOBIDON AND HERE IS JOBIDON THIS AG AN LIKE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO AND THIS S NOT THE SAME DU THE REASON THE CITIES

MOST OF THE COMMENTS ON LINE WERE THINGS LIKE IT'S JUST GREAT TH PEOPLE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ANY MORE YOU WANT KNOWHO ENDED THE DISCUSION IT WAS JOHN STEWART IT REALLY WAS OW NO WHO RECALLS THIS BECAUSE NOW AN ENTIRE GENERATION HAS PASSED THIS KENNISTUFF MAKES ME FEEL OLD AN REMEMBER WHEN IT HAPPENED WIVE AS TWENTY WHEN IT HAPPENED AND UP JOHN STUART AN TWO THOUSAND FORS DURING THE TWO THOUSAND FORACE BETWEEN GEORGE SHOBEBISH AND JOHN CARRY AND JOHN STEART WONT ON A SHOW THAT WAS KOWN AS CROSS FIRE FOR THOSE YOU DON'T REMEMBER AT A MEDIA HISTERY CROSS FIRE WAS A SHOW ON SIANEN THAT' STAR TUCKER CARLSON IN A MUCH EARLIER ITERATION OF TUCKER CARLSON TIS BOTIE TUCKER CARLSON FIRS AS POLBAGALA WHO'S A DEMOCRATIC CONSULTANT ORIGINALLY FOR BILCLINTN AND THEY WOUD BASICLLY GET ON THE AIR AND THE WERE DEBATE ISSUES EVERYDAY AND JOHN STEART WHO WAS A COMMEDIAN PLAYING THE CLOWNNOS ON CLOWN NOS OFFERTINE HE GOES ON SIANEN AND HE THEN PROCEEDS TO SAY THAT THESE TWO ARE RUINING THE COUNTRY FOR HAVING WHAT WAS EFFECTIVELY A CIVIL DEBATE ABOUT THE ISSUES THEY WERE RUINING THE COUNTRY AND HERE WAS JOHN STEART RECKING CROSS FIRE AGAIN THAT WAS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE TO ADDED DISCUSSION FROM DIFFERENT SIDES THE OUT UNI YOU CANT SE A SHO LIKE THIS ANY MORE AN USEDTO BE LOTS TO SHOWS LIKE THIS HERE'S A SHON FOX YUS TO BE CALL HANIDY AND COMES  A GENERATION AGO ALLAN COLMS

SCARBOROGH'S MORNING JO SCARTED JO SCARBOROGH WAS MORE OF REPUBLICAN AND MEKA BRUSHINSKY WAS MORGEDEMOCRAT USED O BE MORE LIKE THAT THT HAS COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED THE MODERN MEDIA LANDSCAPE WI IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT JOHN STUART DID HERE WHAT HE DID IS HE LIED HE SAID THAT A PARTISAN DISAGREEMENT IS INHERENTLY BAD AND THTIT MAKES THE COUNTRY WORSE THAT WHEN PEOPLE EIR THERE DISAGREEMENTS IN PUBLIC WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THEY ARGUE BACK AND FORTH THAT THIS RIPS OPART THE COUNTRY IT'S PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE IT'S WHEN JACK ASSIS LIKE JOHN STUART MUG FOR THE CAMERA TAFTER SHOWING A CLIP OUT OF CONTECT THAT THE COUNTRY GETS WORSE INSTEADOF AFTER HVING TO KNOW ANYTHING THE ENTIRE GAME BECOMES SHOW OCLIP OF SOMEBODY DOING DUM THING THEN GO THAT WAS JOHN STUART'S ENTIRE STICK FOR LIKE TWENTY YEARS AND THAT SUBSTITUTED FOR ACTUAL POLITICAL CONVERSATION IT'S SUBSTITUTED FOR ACTUAL POLITICAL DBATE  NOBODY GOT SMARTER WATCHING JOHN STEART IN FACT'S GOT SIGNIFICANTLY DUMBER WATCHING JOHN STEART SHOW BECAUSE HE'S ENTIRE STICK WAS BASELLY A TWITTERDUNK HEU HOSE TWITTER DUNKS BEFORE TWORE DUNKS WORTH THING HERE IS JOHN STEWARD GOING AFTER TOCKER CARLSON IN POLBIGALLA AND BASECALLY BECAUSE OF THIS AGAIN THE NOTION OF LIKE E CIVIL DEBATE BETWEEN COMPETING SIDES O THE OUT WHICH WAS ALLWAY BACK TO SHOWS LIKE FIRING LINE IN THE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES WOU BE DEBATES WITH PEOPLE BETWEEN LIKE WILLIAM F BUCKLEY AND JOHN KENNETH GALBRAYS ARE YOU USED TO BE PEOPLE SHOWING UP ON THE SHOW TO DEBATE EACH OTHER AND IT WOULD BE PEOPLE LIKE MALCOLM MUGRAGE AND BOB WOODWARD OR NOM CHOMSKY WOULD SHOW UP AND HE WOULD BE TO BATING SOMEBODY LIKE HENRY KISSENGER MADE THAT THAT KIND OF STUFF HAPPENED ON TEVIA USED TO ACTUALY BE AN INTELLIGENT COUNTRY THE COUNTRY AND THEN JOHN STEWARD CAME ALONG AND AGAIN IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE'RE AT THE PEAK OF TOLIVISION POLITICS  FIRING LINE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SHOW THAN AND CROSS FIRE BECAUSE WILLIAM F BUCKLEY WAS FRANKLY MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT THAN ANY ONE IN POLITICS FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT JOHN STEWARD RIPPING DOWN CROSS FIRE WAS IN FACT ONE OF THE SIGNAL MEDIUM MOMENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY HERE WAS I MADE A SPECIAL EVER TO COME ON THE SHOWTAY BECAUSE I HAVE A PRIVATELY AMONGS MY FRIENDS AND ALSO AND OCCASIONAL ISPAVRTION TELISIONSI MENTIONED  THIS SHOW AS BEING A A BAD AND NOT US AND AND I WANTED TO I FELT THAT THAT

DO IS FOR E HARTISAN HACKERY GAY SO AGAIN HE'S ONE BEING DISHONEST AND HOW DO YOU SAY AND YOU SOULD HELP THE COUNTRY RAMIN HE'S THIS IS A DEMAN GODJEC ARGUMENT IN THE DISGUISE OF COMEDY WHICH IS WHAT JOHN STEWARD TO BETTER THAN LITTERAL ANOWIN VERY TALENTED AT IT NOW COME PRES ENY'S ON TOWNS TAT HE WAS WHOU SUPERTAWLENTED AT IT BUT WHAT HE IS DOING IN THAT PARTICULAR CLEB IS REALLY DISHONEST WHAT HE IS SAYING IS TAT YOU GOTS YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST YOU'RE HELPING THE POLITICIANS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING A DEBATE YOU'RE ACTUALLY HELPING THE POLITICIONS BY BEING PARTISAN HAKS WELL WHAT YOU ARE BASICALLY SAYING IS THAT ONE SIDE DESERVES DEFENSE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS HERS MOCKERY WHICH WAS ACUALLY JOHN STEWART'S MODEL JOHN STEWARDS MAND THEN WHEN YE CALLED THE PINES TO OMTIS TO COMMEDIAN I'M JUST COMMITS NOW THER BRINGING HIM BACK FROM THE DEAD AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE HIM ON I GESS ONCE A WEEK ON MONDAYS TO TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION AND MAKE THE COUNTRY WORSE AGAIN BUT I THINK IT IS WORTH WHILE TO POINT OUT THAT NEARLY ALL POLITICAL COMMENTARY ON CABLE TVHE HAS NOW BECOME JOHN STUART JOHN STO RETURNED EVERYBODY INTO JOHN STUART RICHALLY EVERY MAIN STREAM POLITICAL COMMENTATOR ON T V NOW DOES THIS MODEL OF WHAT IT LOOKS MUCH IF YOU IF YOU PICK UP A CHELENCIAN THEN A MASENBUSY OR EVEN FOX NEWS RIGHT NOW IF YOU WATCH THOSE SHOES YOUR VERY UNLIKELY TO SEE INDEPT POLITICAL COMMENTARY WHAT YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SEE IS SOMEBODY DOING A QUASIC COMMETIC MONOWOGUE WITH A PICKAN PICK WERESMEBODY MAKES A FACE THAT EVERY ONE TURN TO JOHNSTORD BECAUSE OF JOHN STOART TO PAR OR POTICSCEP BATTER OR WORSE IT TURNS OUT THAT MOCKERY IS REALLY BAD FOR POLITICS SOMETIMES MOCKERYS DESERVED AND MOCKERY IS FUNNY AND WE DO SOME OF IT ON THE SHELL WELL WE ALSO TRY TO DO IS AC SHOUL GO THROUGH THE ISSUES IN DAT JOHNSTEREN NEVER TRIED TO DO THAT BUT HE'S REALLY SUCCESSFUL IN NOT DOING THAT FO IGNORANCE IT TURNS OUT IS REALLY A SUCCESSFUL IT'S A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY BEING IN IGNORAMUS FOR PAY IS A GREAT STRATGY IN TH MODERN MEDIA ALL YOU DOSIT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WIT'S GOING ON MAN OU YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ALL I KNOW IS THAT NOWS JOHN STORTS ENTIRE MODEL AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT BECAME ALL OF POLITICS AND THAT WAS NOT GOOD FOR AMERICAN POLITICS JOINING SOME E LINE IS SPENCER AT LINQUISTIS O FIELDS REPORTOF FORT THE ALWARE AND HE 'S CURNELLY DOWN AT TAS MEXICA BORDER RIGHT NOW SPENCER THNKS MUCH FOR JOINING US VERY MUCH RATHEMI SO LESS TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING TO DAY DOWN AT THE SOUTHERBORDR WHERE ARE YOUE AT THE BORDER SOME RIGHT HERE A SHALL BE PART THIS IS AN EAGLE PAST TAXAS THIS RIND ME AR HERE THIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE LEADING IN THE MAXICO AND THIS PARK HAS BEEN THE AP THECENTER OF THIS FED BETWEEN THE STATE OF TAXAS  GOVER ABBIT AND T THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF COURSE WE HAVE THIS SUPREME COURT RULING JUST THIS WEEK N HAVE THIS ON GOING STRUGGLE OVER WHETHER NOT THE STATE OF TAXAS CAN PUT UP RAZOR WIRE TO THE TUR MIGRIS COMING IN SO THE STATE OF TAXAS CAN IN FACT THATHEY'VE NOT BEN ORDERED NOT TO TAKE THE RAZEWIRE AND PUT IT THERE IS JUST THAT THEY CAN'T STOP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM DISMANCELLING THE RAZOR WIRE IF PORTER PATROL WANTS TO GO IN DISMANTAL THE RAZOR WIRE THAN THE STATE OF TAXAS ACCORDING T THE SPREME COURT HAS TO LET THEM GO AND DO THAT THIS ALL SEEMS TO BE COMING TO A HEAD BECAUSE OF COURSE GOVERNOR ABBOT HAS NOW SUGGESTED THAT HE IS GOING TO NOT ONLY CONTINUE TO ERECT RAZOR WIRE BUT ALSO MAY BE TAKE OTHER MEASURES THE REALITY IS OF COURSE UNTIL TEXAS COMES UP I THE MECHANISM FOR EXPELLING PEOPLE BACK TO MEXICO THAT RAZOR WIRE CAN ONLY STOP PEOPLE THEERETICALLY FROM CROSSING THE BOARDER WHERE IS THE RAZOR WIRE IS IT ACTUALLY IN AMERICAN TERRITORIES IT RIGHT ON THE BORDER WHAT ARE YOU SEEING OVER THERE TRUSING TWO DIFFERENT TAXS OF WIRE THER THEY'RE USING HER THE BORER AND THIS IS RIGHT ON THE BANKS OF THE REAL GRAND LA ADDING THE ENTIRE LAG FOR THIS PARK SO THEY'VE GOT SHIPPING CONTAINERS NON TOP THOSE SHIPPINYETANAS THEY HAVE ACTUAL FULL FLEG RAZOR WIRE AND ON THE GROUND THATE GOTSOMLIN CALLED TRIPPLE STRAN CONCERTENO WIRE WHICH IS SIMILAR BUT LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THT ALL THIS IS TO SERVE AT THE DETERMIN AND OF COURSE WITH THE SUPREME CRADASRULED AS YOU STATED IS THAT FORT PATROL OR CAN  THROUGH THIS WIRE THEY ARE LO TO DO THAT BUT THE CACH IS THAT THE TAXOF FATAL GUARDEN TAXITY YES ARE NOT ALLOWING FOR TE PATROL INTO THIS PARK SO THE PARK IS SEALED OFF ALL THE ACENS I IT'S VERY TIRELY CONTROL OL AND REALY ITS JUST ETATS AUTHORITIES AND CERTAINMEMBER OMEDIA T AR BEING BYTIT BUT BEYOND THACT THIS ENTERED ALL THESE ENTRANCES ARE VERY MUCH SEALED BYBORT BY TEXS NATIONAL GUARD AND A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY SE WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM MEMBERS OF BORDAR PATROL OR ANY ONE ELSE OVER THERE ABOUT THAT STANED OFF WHICH REALLY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AT THE AT THE RAZOR WIRERSELF SEEMS TO BE AT THE ENTRY TO THE PART HAS THERE BEEN ANY  ARGUING WHAT EXACTLY'S HAPPENING SO THES BEEN LOKIN A CONFUSION BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY AVE SEEN SOME PORT OF PATROL VEHICLES ENTERING THE PART AND SOMETHING INTERETING HERE IS THAT THERE'S A BOTGRAM SO THEY ARE ALLOWING LIMITED ACTS OS TO BORT OF PATROLS A THEY CAN USE THIS BOTGRAMD BUT BEYOND THAT I REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY INTERACTION BETWEEN MEMBERS OF BORT OF PATROL AND MEMBERS OF THESE TACTS AUTHORITIES SO THE CONFLICT REALLY DOES SEEN RELEGATED TO OF COURSE THE MEDIA AND THE COURTS AND THE SWATER POLITICAL STRUGGLE BUT HERE ON THE GROUND THERE REALLY ISN'T TOO MUCH TENSION BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS AND WE KNOW TO DAY THAT THERE WAS AN ULTIMATA AT A DEAD LINE REALLY THAT WAS SET SAYING THAT BORBETRAL MUST BE GIVEN ACES THE PART IFROM WHAT I'VE SEEM ON THE GROUND HERE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH CONFIDENCE AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTUO CAN BE TAKING MUCH IN THE WAY OF ACTION IF THAT DEAD LINE IS NOT THAT SE HAVE YOU SEEN A LINE OF I LLEGALIMIGRANS AT THE ACTUAL BORDER ITSELF IS WHAT WATS THE STANDISS OF THE THE ACTUAL MON WHAT AEYOU SEEN THERE SO IT CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT THESE FORTIFICATIONS HAVE WORKED I CAME HERE IN MAY I TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND WHOS A WILDLY DIFFERENT SEEN WE SAW I REALBELY THIS WAS PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AND YOU COULD GO REALLY ALMOST ALL THE WAY UP TO THE BORDER AND YOU DID SEE PEOPLE COMING IN THRS VENTEWS AT ASCERCULANDED OF TA DOZENS EVEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COMING IIN THROUGH THIS CROSSING BUT RIGHT NOW WERE NOT SEENG VERY MUCH THE WAY OF ACROSSINGS THERE WAS RECENTLY JUST AT DAMN THAT LETMORE WATER FLOW DOWN THE REAR GRAND SO THIS INCREASED WATER IS INCREASED RISING WATER LEVEL THIS SUPPRESSING SOME OF THAT TURNED OUT FROM THE MIGRANTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE DO KNOW THAT THE ACTIONS FROM DEEP PIAZ IN THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE CUTTING BACK ON THE NUMBER OF CROSSING AT THER SEEING I JUST LAST NIGHT ACTUALLY OBTAINED OF VIDIO WERE TAXES UPON OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND NATIONAL GUARD WERE TOGETR THER TO APPREHEND SOME POLITICAL MIGRANS AND ACTUALLY ARECTISIT AN IMPRISON THOSE TWO WHO CAME HERE THAT THEY CHARGED THEM WAS TRASPASSING A SO WE DO KNOW THAT THESE THESE TACTICS HAVE BEEN EFFECTAL THESE TACTICS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE SO PRESUMABLY THE YO YOU MENTION THEYAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH TRASSPASSING THATS A DOMESTIC AMERICAN CRIME PRESUMABLY THEY WOULD BE IF CON VICTED HELDEN IN DOMESTIC AMERICAN PRISEN OR TURNED OVER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF EMIGRATION STUS WAS CHACTOR CISE WHOM IT WILL BE THERE NOT HERE LEGALLY AND SO THE HE QUESTION THEN IS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVRNMENT DOES WITH THEM O YOU HAVE ANY STATUS OR WAS THE PLAN WITH THOSE PARTICULAR PEOPLE SO THAT IS ONE OF THES TICKAN POINTS RIGHT NOW LEKE YOU SAID THESE PEOPLE THEYE ARE BEING TAKEN TO HE LOCAL DOMESTIC JAILS DEMESTIC PRISONS A SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THESE PEOPLE GON TO AND OUP BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THEYARE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY THE TEXS AUTHORITIES THAT IS TO TO NOT JUST HAND IS EOPLE OVER ORDER PATROL BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY DO HAVD THEM OVER TOE PORT O PATROL WHAT WERE LIKEWE HAVE S THEY'LL BE PROCASKED ET MAY BE HANDED OFF TO AN ENGIO THAT WILL IALLOW THEM TO FLY THROUGHOUT THE RESTS OF THE COENTRY SO THEY'RE ARD SPECIFIC ACTIONS AT AR BEING TAKEN BY TEXAS AUTHORITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PEOPLE DO NOT BE HANDED OVER TOBOARDER PATROL FOR THAT REASON FOR THE FEAR THAT THEY WOLVSBE PROCESS IN ALOWDING OF THE INTERIOR HE TO OBVIOUSLY THAT THIS THI SITUATION CONTINUES TO BE VERY FLUID ON THE GROUND WERE GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK TO YOU FOR UPDATES AS YOU GAIN ANY MORE INFORMATION WHAT WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM TAT THE VARIOUS SIDES OF THIS DEBATE ON THE GOUND YOU SAID THAT THERE EEMS TO BE MOSTLY CONFUSION ON THE GROUND WHAT AE YOU HEARING FROM AND TEXAS STATE AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS THAT THE BORDER PATROL NTHE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES WELL IT CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT TEXAS D PES AND NATIONAL GUARD OR U SET ON THAT MAINTAIN THEIR FORTIFICATIONS HERE JUST LAST NIGHT I SAW ENGINEERS WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD PUTTING UP MORE RAZOR WIRES SO THEY CERTAINLY HAVE NO INTENTION OF BACKING DOWN DONTENTION OF TAKING DOWN THIS RAZOR WATER AND IT DOESN'T SEEM THA THEY HAVEN'TY INTENTION OF LETTING PORT OF PATROL TAKE CONTROL THE PARK ARK EITHER SO IT SEEMS THAT TAXAS IS DAKING IN THEIR HEELS AND IT CERTAINL CERTAINLY ENTOBE INTRTING TO WATCH HOW THIS SITUATION GRASSES IN THE COMING DAYS ID SPENTUR LINGUEST REPORTING FROM THE BORER SPENT TO REALLY

WELL FOLKS LAST NGHT WAS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY AND AS EXPECTED DONAL TRUMP BLEW AWAY THE FIELD THIS OF COURSE WAS NOT A GIANT SHOCK THE POLLING JUST BEFORE THIS PARTICULAR PRIMARY HADONAL TRUMP UP TWENTY PLUS POINTS IN MANY OF THE POLLSON TRUM ACTUALLY WENT AND VISITED A BUNCH OF THE SITES TBIG CROWDS THERE AND HEO WAS VERY TRUMPY HERE'S WHAT A SOUNDED LIKE BI CROWD YER E TOETI ER  A B I E  I I WE  STO R WE STOP E A  LI TI WE I E A RA A WE MA STOP E WI WOR  A AD NOBODI DO WE WI O E TI I REE MA I WI   LI  AN IN E E I OWHER TE RE ER NO NO TE AT I DON E I TAS A LET E O T E E TO WA TO TI A LAT  I A I SA TA I TE E ET A WO E LIK I  MAK E LE E GRATI I N THA I TE LI I E IK I TOP HER LI EE AT E THREE WOR E O LE MA BE WA I TI A E SE A LIK I AN TI I SI E SO HE WINS THE PRIMER IS AR OVER THEY'RE OVER AFTER IWUP I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO SAY ABOUT THAT IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION OF JUST WHY NICKEY HALEY FAILED TO RESINATE AS SORT OF THE ANTI TRUMP CANSIDATE NOW PART OF IT IS THAT THERE JUST ISN'T IN ANTI TRUMP WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SUFFICIENT TO ACTUALLY OVERCRUMP OVERCOME THE THE PROTRUM WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTYMENTS ON TRUMP BECAME THE NOMINY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN EVERYBODY CAME HOME AND THEN ARE BECAME HME AGAIN AN TWENTY TWENTY AND EAVE WE'S COMING HOE AGAIN AN TWENTY TWENTY FOURE THAT IS NOT A GIANT SHOCK THAT IS IN FACT AWAY POLITICS WORKS AND SO PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AND HIS RESULTS IN SAY NEU HAMPSHURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SAYING HE 'S GON A REPLICITE HIS THIRTY FIVE PER CENT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ARE IGNORING THE FACT THAT IN THE INTERVENING PERIOD HE BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEN RAN AND ENTIRE NOTHER ELECTION CYCLE AND NOW IS RUNNING YET A THIRD ELECTION CYCLE BUT THE OUTSIZE THE ANIMUS FOR NICKEY HAYLEY THAT YOU SEE ON SOME PARTS OF THE RANADUTHING ITS OUTSIZES PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE IF YOU OPPOSE TRUMP TERE'S A PART OF THE BASTHIT JUST IS ANGRY AT YOU FOR HAVING A POST TRUMP AND ALLOVE IT HAS TO DO WIT THAT IM IN NICKY HALEY AGAIN WAS HIS UAN AMBASSADOR SHE WAS SOMENY WORKED FOR HIM SHE SUMMODY WHOSE PRAISED HIS PRESIDENCY AND SO THE IDEA THAT SHE SMIRCT A WILD ANTI TRUMP FORCE I THINK IS WRONG BUT WHAT NICKEY HALEY DOES HAVE IS AN AFFECT PROBLEM THAT IS OUT OF I WOULD SAY PATTERN WITH THE MODERN RE PUBLICAN PARTY THE REPUBLICAN PARY AT THIS POINT IS IN FACT A PARTY THAT IS ANGRY AND I THINK JUSTIFIABLY ANGRY ON A NUMBER OF SQUORES ONE OF THE THINGS THE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ANGRABOUT THE BASE PARTICULARLY HEY'RE VERY ANGRY ABOUT HEARING ABOUT RACIAL DIVISIONS THEY BEEN LECTURED SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SINCE BRAKMON ROUND FOR PRESIDENTY THOUSAND SEVEN THEY BEEN LECTURED THAT AMERICA WAS COMING CLOSE TO RACIAL UNITY ONLY TO HAVE THAT RIPPED AWAY FROM THEM AND ANDTO WATCH AS EVERYBODY SORT OF RETREATED BACK INTO TRIBALISTIC CORNERS AND THIS IS HAW YOU WENT UP WITH CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND D  EY AN EQUITY THROUT THE BY ADMINISTRATIONS SO EN THE HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY ABOUT HOW AMERICA IS A PLACE THAT WAS REPLETE WITH DISCRIMINATION EVEN TWENTY YEARS AGO OR THIRTY YEARS AGO THEY TTENDE THINK I NOT SURE THAT THE PERSON WHO SAYING THAT IS THE PERSON THAT I WANT FIGHTING THIS FIGHT TODAY NOTHIN PEOPLE ARE LYING ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF TWENTY OAR THIRTY YEARS AGO BUT TO POINT OUT THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE OF TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO IS DOES THAT MAKE YOU THE PERSON WHO IS BEST SUITED TO FIGHT AGAINST THE D E I CULTURE TO DAY THE REASON THAT'S COMING UP IS BECAUSE THERE IS A CLIP OF NICKIHALYW THE ONE VIBRAL JUST BEFORE THE PRIMARIES IN WHICH SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD AND AGAIN WHET SHE SAYS HERE I DON'T THINK IS ACTUALLY WILDLY CONTROVERSIAL EXCEPT THAT IT IS VERY MUCH AT ODDS WITH THE ATTITUDE OF MANY MEMBERS THE REPUBLICAN BAYS WHICH IS TO SAY ARE YOU GOING TO STAND UP AGAINST THE PREDATIONS OF THE D  I C AR T CULTURE ARE YOU TO STAND UP AGAINST THE IDEA THAT AMERICA'S A PLACE OF RACIAL DEVISION WITH SUFFICIENT ALACRITY OR ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO PLAY A LITTLE AF IDENTITY POLITICS FOR GAIN HERE'S THE CLIPPINICKIHLO UN TOTALLY VIREL WE WERE THE ONLY IN ONE FAMILY AND OUR SMALL SOUTHERN TOWN I WAS TETH EVERY DAY FOR BEING BROWN SO ANY ONE THAT WANTS TO QUESTION IT CAN GO BACK AN LOOK AT WHAT I'VE SAIDE ON HOW HARD IT WAS TO GROW UP IN THE DEEP SOUTH AS A BROWN GIRL WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THANG THAT I HAD BLATE FRIEND AS A THORCE OF PRIDE THAING THAT I HAD WHITE FRIENDS O THORC OF PRIDE DON'F YOU WAN I KNOW WHAT IT WAS WHITE GRAWING UP I WAS THIS QUALIFIHTE FROM A BANDY PATCHET BECAUSE I WAS AT WHITE OR BLAD BECAUSE THI DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT ME THE LOOK I KNOW THE HARDSHIPS THE PAING THAT COME WITH RAH OF IT'S THE RATHEN THAT I FIGHTE BOLITE EVERYDAY WHEN IT COMES THE RACOM ANTITHEMITASM OR HATE AND I ALWAYS WELL AT SO THE REASON THAT CLIP WON FIRAL ON THE RIGHT IS BECAUSE AGIN THE QUESTION IS IS SHE SAYING THAT SERVIVS UFF TO PANNER TO LEGACY MEDIA OR IS SHE DOING WHAT TIMS GOSS WORD DID DURING THE CAMPAIGN RA SAYS LOOK HOW FAR WE'VE COME I'VE SUFFERED FROM RACES I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE BUT AMERICA IS A PLACE OF OPPORTUNITY AND TO PRETEND THAT AMERICA TO DAY IS WHEN AMERICA WAS YESTERDAY IS FOOLISH OR IS TO SAY IAM A DIVERSE CANDIDATE BOTE FOR ME KIND OF PLAY I THINK LOT RE PUBLICANS TOOK AWAY THE LATTER MESSAGE FROM CLIPSE LIKE THAT ONE AND A OBVIOUSLY DID NOT HELP MECKAHALY NOW AGAIN I THINK THAT'S COMBINED WITH THE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY PROTRUMP AND VERY ANGRY THAT ANYBODY WOULD DAIGN RUN AGAINST TRUMP WHATEVER THE RESULT IT DIDN'T END OP WELL FOR NICKEHALY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE OVER ALL THAT SHE SAYS THAT SHE IS NOT GOING TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE JUST YET SHE SAID YESTERDAY THAT SHE WAS NOT GOING TO TALK TO LITICAL ABIT UARIES I DIDN'T GET     I AI   O OAN O A A O TI I AO A  O  TA O   T E     TA IWEITAI O TAO I  TA    I  WE A  O II I WOR AR NI O  O O  I A RN NOW IT'S COUPLE WEEKS UNTIL SOUTH CAOLINEAN DO I THINK THET NICKEY HALEIS CAN A STAY IN ALL THE WAY UNTILL SOUTH CAROLINA I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHYSH SYOU WOULD MAKE YOU US TO RACK UP SOME DELEGATES IN CASE THERE'S AN ACT OF GOD AN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO TRUMP AN THEY GO TO THE CONVENTION SHE SAYS I'AM THE PERSON WITH THE SECOND MOST ELEGATES AND MAKE HER CASE THERE MAYBE SHEU WANS TO TRADE HER DELEGATS FOR SOME SOR SLOT INTH ADMINISTRATION THAT'S THAT'S QUITE POSSIBLE TO WHATEVER IT IS THE PRIMARIES ARE OVER THEY'VE NOVERSE THAN TIWAW EVERYTHNG ELSE IS MERELY A A SORT OF WAST OF OF TIME AND EFFORT I THINK SPENDING MORE TIME ON IT NOW WITH ALL THAT SET YIVE YOU'R A DEMOCRAT YOU SORT OF YEEL LIKE TRAP MAYE JUST SNAP CLOSES ON YOUROPONENTS FOR A LONG TIME DMOCRAFTS PROTICTING THE LEGS SIMEDIA BEIN SAYING THAT ALL OF DONAL TRUMPS OPPONETS THEI'R TERRIBLE THE'RE AWFUL THEY'RE NO GOOD THEIR VERY BAD EXCEPT FOR NIKEY HALEY WHO IS KIND OF OKT AND THE RESINUS TISUOUS KIND OF VOKE IS BECAUSE AGAN OF THAT SORT OF SOFTER AFFECTS THAT SH HAS BUT DON'T WORRY IF NICKEY HALEY HAD ACTUALLY BECOME THE RE PUBLICAN NOMINASUEMEN JUST THE BAT OS TRUMP WORSE THAN TRUM BECAUSE SHE'S MORE SEDUCTIVE IN TERMS OF HER POLITICS AND INTERUMS OF HER MEAN THAN THAN TRUMP IS AND THAT THAT THAT WOUD AV BEN THE PLAY BUT NOW THAT TRUMP IS THE NOMINE YOURSTARING SEE POLES THAT ARE EMERGING IN TH SWING STATES TO PULL FROM PENNSYLVANIA WITH TRUMP DOWN AT TO JOBIDON THE THE ATTEMPT TO MOVE FROM DONALD TRUMP IS THE SCARIOUS PERSON IN THE WORLD YOU CAN NOMINATE HIM PLUS ALL DONALD TRUMPS OPPONENTS ARE EVEN WORSE THAN DONAL TRUMP RIP ON TO SAN TIS RIP ON HALEY RIP ON EVERYBODY ELSE IN TE MEDIA BY THE MEDIA AND THEN TRUMP GETS THE NOMINATION ALL THE SUDDEN SIKE ALL LOOK AT THAT HE'S LOSING IN THES WINS WATCH FOR THAT MOVE FROM THE LEGAC MEDA AND OF COURSE IT IS WAY TO EARLY TO TELL WHOSE GON WHEN THE SELECTION WHO'S

CAN HAVE A GO I SAT DOWN WITH A LIBERAL STREAMER NAMED STEPHEN BENOW HE CALLS HIMSELF DESTINY AMINE GUT A BIG FOLLOWING AMON AND FRANKLI REALLY HADN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT HIM OR VIEWED HIS VIDIOS MUCH UNTIL I AGREE TO DEBATE HIM ON LECS FREEDMAN'S SHO AND CAN LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE DEBATE OVER AT LECIS UTUP GENTAL AND I'S REALLY I THIN WORTH THE LISTENITS COUPLE HOURS LONG THE REASON ANT SORT OF FASCINATING IS BECAUSE WE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND AND ONE OF BECAUS PIECES OF GROUND RE COVERED IS THE DEBATE BETWEEN BIDON AND TRUMP AND TDONAL PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF THAT FOR YOU RIHTE HERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE DEBATE OBVIOUSLY GOING INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION HIS THE DEBATE BETWEEN BIDON AND TRUMP THE THE DEBATE DID NOT CENS ORE PARTICULARLY MUCH ON JOBIDON'S RECORD BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT JOBIDN'S RECORD E'S DEEPLY FLOD AND GNG TO GET TO MORE OF THAT IN JUST ONE SECOND INSTEAD IT CENSERED ON HES CENTRAL CONTENTION THAT ISBEING MADE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE VOTING FOR BIDON WHICH IS THE DONAL TRUMP OUGHT TO BE RULED OUT JUST RIGHT AWAY JUST RIGHT OFF THE BAT DONAL TRUMP IS CANNOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE HE'S JUST TO SCARY HE'S TOO DEVICIVE HE'S TOO TORRANNICAL SO WHAT DESTINY SAID WAS THAT DONAL TRUMP IS THE MOST DEVICIVE POLITICAL FIGURE IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND WHEN I POINTED OUT TO STEPHEN IS THAT JOBIDON IS IN MANY WAYS MORE DEVICE OF WHY BECAUSE WHEN DONAL TRUMP CAME INTO OFFICE DONAL TRUMP WAS EXPECTED TO BEDEVICIV HE WERE ANY SECRETS ABOUT DONAL TRUMP BEING A DEVICE OF CHARACTER HE CAME INTO OFFICE HE DID NOT HAVE A POSITIVE APPROVAL RATING FOR BUT MAYBE TWO DAYS IS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY JOBDE WAS EXPECTED TO BE AE PERSON HE UNITED THE COUNTRY AND THEN HE COMPLETELY FAILED HEREI HER'S WHAT I HAD TO SAID CANASC LIKE FOR OUR HEAD OF STATE AUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE SHOULD ORETORIC BE ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HE DOES IEAN THE ANSWER WOULD BE S AND NOW  BEN GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN A PERSON IF I THINK INCALIBRATED WAYS SAYS THINGS THAT ARE DEVICIVE IN A PERSON WHO AN UNCALEBRATED WAYS SAYS THINGS THAT ARE DEVISIVE AND SO THE EVIDENCE THAT JOBIDONIS DEVISIVE IS EVERY POL TAKEN SINCE ESSENTIALLY AUGUST IVE OF TWENTYTWENTY ONE HE HE IS BY ALL AVAILABLE METRICS INCREDIBLY DEVISIVE A HUGE PERCENATE OF AMERICANS ARE DEEPLY UNHAPPY NOT ONLY WITH HIS PERFORMANCE BUT DON'T BELIEVE HIS UNITER AD THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THAT DEMOCRAS OUGHT KEP IN MINE IS THAT DEMOCRATS ARE OUR THINKING JUST RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT DONAL TRUMP IS SO DEVICIF BECAUSE IT WIS RHETORIC IND ALL THE THINGS HE SAYS BUT OUR PEOPLE DISAPPOINTED WITH TRUMP OR E'S TRUMP KIND OF WHAT HE ALWAYS WAS BECAUSE ONE OF FEELINGS I GET IS THAT PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN JOBID N THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT FEELING TO SHAKE IF YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED IN A POLITICAL CANSIDITE HE ATTEND TO TURN AWAY FROM THAT POLITICAL CANSIDITE THAT WAS ACTUE THE STORY THE TWENT TOF ELECTION BETWEEN TWO THOUSINATE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BROKAMAMA ACTHI LOST VOTES HE'S THE FIRST IN COMMED PRESIDENT TO LOSE VOTES AND SOMEHOW RETAIN THE PRESIDENCY NOW WHY DID THAT HAPPEN HOW COUN HE RETAIN THE PRESIDENCE IN THE ANSWER IS HE GOT PEOPLE WHO WERE LARGELY UNENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT VOTING TO VOTE AND THA'S PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR BLACK VOTERS AN TWINGSTAKES A PER FORMANCE THAT IS NOT ET BEN REPLICATED BY ANY DEMOCRAT HELO CLAN OR TOBIDEN WHEN IT COMES TO PRESIDENTS WH ARE EXPECTED TO UNITE AND THEN DIVIDE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT THE CIN WOULD RATHER KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING THAND BE DISAPPOINTED IN A PROMISE THAT IS UNFULFILLED THERE IS NO PROMISE THE TRUMP IS MADE THAT IS UNFULFILLED GOOD AND BAD BUT JOBIDON CAME INTO OFFICE ON THE WINGS OF EAGLES JOBIDON CAME INTO OFFICES PLEDGING TAT HE WAS GOING TO UNITE THO COUNTRY IS ON T BRING HONOR AND THE ADULTS BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND INSTEAD HE IS PROVIDED TERRIBLE LEADERSHIP AND DIVI SOFREDERIC AND SPEECHES IN WHICH HE LIBLES HALF THE COUNTRY TERRIBLE AND AWFUL AND THREATS DEMOCRACYN WE ALSO TRALKS ABOUT THE IDEA OF TYRANNY SO STEPHEN FOCUST A LOT ON JANUARY SIX HE FOCUST A LOT ON THE IDEA THAE TRUMP WOULD IF HE COULD BE A TYRANT AND THE POINT DI MADE IS THAT DONALD TRUMP YO WOULD HE WOULD HE EXERCISE POWER IF HE COULD EXERCISE POWER IN WAYS THAT I WOULD NOT LIKE SURE HE IS SAID THAT HE WOULD HE RECENTLY WENT ON AS WITTERSPRIG OR A TRUTH SOCIAL SPRING IN WHICH HE CLAIM THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS WHAT HE CALED ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY LIKE FOR ANY CRIME EVER SO DO I THINK THAT HE WOULD EFFECTURATE THAT IF HE COULD SURE IS HE GOING TO DO ANY OF THAT NO HE'S NOT HERE HE HERE'S HI EXPLAINED IT TO STEPHEN WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT O WHICH CHARACTER IS MORE TYRANNICAL JOBIDON HAS USED EXECUTIVE POWER IN WAYS THAT FAR OUT STRAT ANYDINGTHAT AS THAT IT HAS BEEN STRETCHING A STRETCHING A STRETCHING EXECUTIVE POWERY O JO TOBITE IS GOING LIKE JOBIDON HAS GONE WELL BEYOND ANYTHING TRUMP EVEN REMOTELY ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN VO I JUST PURE EXECUTIVE POWER  JOBIDON LITERALLY USED THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HAZARD ADMINISTRACHION SHOUR TRY TO CRAM DOWN BAX AMAN AAN EIGHTY MILLION AMERICANS THAT'S INSANE SURELYD RIGHT TAT I AN NOT RELIEF STUDENT LONDET AND THEN TRY TO RELIEVE THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND YET BUT WHAT OT  THAT THEY GOT STRUCK I MITS ROM AND THEN THEY STILL DID IT THEY STILL DID IT BIDON BRAGS ABOUT IT HES SO AGAIN I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE POINTS THAT ARE BEING USED AGAINST TRUMP ARE NOT ACTUALLY DISPOSITIVE AND AND I THNK THAT REALLY IS THE NAME OF THE GAME FOR DEMOCRATS IF THEY CANNOT KILL TRUMP RIGHT OFF THE BAT IF THEY CAN'T KILL AS CANNACY RIGHT OFF THE BAT THEY GOT A PROBGS WHAT EXACTLY IS THE FUEL THEY ARE GOING TO ADD TO THE FIRE BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER WHAT EXACTLY IS THE INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT ABOUT TRUMP THIS GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING I DON'T REALLY SEE I ANDTHE BIGGEST PROBM OF ALL FOR JOBIDON IS NOT JUST THAT HE IS BAD ON POLICY WHICH GN WILL GET TO IN A MOMENT THE BIGEST PROM FOR GOBIDNES THAT HERE IS A CONFLICT OF VISIONS BETWEEN JOBIDON'S VIEW OF THE WORLD AND WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK HE IS GUIDED BY IN UPPER CRUSS LIBERAL ELET A CODERY THAT DOES NOT THINK LIKE THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES THINKS AND THAT REFUSEES TO TO KIND OF ENGAGE IN THE KIND VERSATIONS THAT THE REST OF AMERICANS ARE ENGAGED IN THEREIS A APPOLL THAT ON TO GET TO IN JUST ONE SECOND THAT EXPLAINS WEARE A LOT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ATEN IS COMING FROM IT AND IS NOT COMING FROM THE SAME PLACE THAT MOST AMERICANS ARE COMING FROM WLLGETO THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST IN A WORLD FILLED WITH UNCERTAINTY YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR ANY POSSIBILITY WHAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED IS MY PATRIOT SUPPLY MY PICTURET SUPPLIS YOURE TRUSTED PARTNER FOR EMERGENCY PREPARED THEN THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST

BENDOT COM RIGHT NOW THAT'S PREPARE WITH BEN DOT TOM AY SO THE CONFLICT OF VISIONS MAY BE THE STORY OF NOT ONLY THIS ELECTION BUT THE ELECTION OF TWENTY SIXTEEN BETWEEN DOMEL TRUMP AND HELERY CLINTON SO THERE IS A A PERSON NAME YOUVALL NOAHARARI YOU'VE ALL NO HARARI IS IN AUTHOR AND A PROFESSOR IN THE PRIMAN OF HISTORY TOE HUBREW UNIVERSITY OF JERUSALEM BUT DON'T LET THAT TITLE FOOL YOU HE IS SORT OF A A POP SOCIOLOGIST JUS CERTAIS A POP ANTHROPOLOGIST AND HE HAPPENS TO BE A MILITANT ATHEIST AND HERE IS HIS VIEW ON LIFE AN THE REASONN BRING THIS OPASIS I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY THE VIEW OF A HUGE NUMBER OF LIBERAL MINDED ELEATS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IT IS COMPLETELY AT ODDS WITH THE WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE I THINK THINK HERE IS OUVAL NOVA NOHARARI HE IS GIVING A TED TOG HERE'S WHA A SOUNDED LIKE MAMY MAY BE MOST LEGA SISTENS OF BATE ON THIS IDEA TIS BELIEF IN YOU IN ARITS BUT YOU IN ARITS OL JUST LIKE HEAVEN AND LIKE GOD IT'S JUST THE FICTIONLESS STORIE THE THWEVE INVENTE AND SPUDEROD STATES AND MATIONS O ALSO LIKE YOUANRITS AND LIKE GOD AND LIKE HEAVEN THA TOO OF O O JEST STORIES ISRE O YOU NOT IT TATES THELO JUST STORIES VERY PAWFUL STORIES STORIES WE MIGHT ONT TO BELIEVE VERY MUCH BUT STILL FELT JUST STORIES YOU CONTOIY SE THE NOT IT TATES YOU CANNOT CONTET YOU CANNOT SMELLITA THEIRE REALITIES ONCE YOU CREATE THIS FACT DALU DISCONNECT WHONCE YOU GET RID OF THAT IVINE OR ANY RATIONAL BASIS AT ALL OR FAITH BASIS FOR FUNDAMENTAL FIRST PRINCIPLES THEN YOU ALL VERY QUICKLY INTO MORAL RELATIVESM AND ONCE YOUR MORAL RELATIVES MAT IS VERY HARD TO ESCAPE IT AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S A REALLY FASCINATING PULL THAT CAME OUT RECENTLY FROM RASMUSON AND IT LOOKED AT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF THE WE DESCRIBE AS THE ELETS HERE'S OUT THE RASKIES AN PULLING GROUP DESCRIBES IT THEY SE THE PEOPLE WHO RUN AMERICA OR WEAST THINK THEY DO LIVE IN A BUMBLE OF THEIR OWN CONSTRUCTION THEVE ISOLATED THEMSELVES FROM EVERYDAY AMERIC IN REALITIES TO SUCH DEGREE THEIR VIEWS ABOUT WHAT IS AND WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN THIS CONTRY DIFFER WIDELY FROM THE AVERAGE AMERICANS AND ANALYSIS OF THEIR THINKING CONDUCTED FOR THE COMITTE TO ENLESE PROSPERITY FINDS THAT ON A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ATIONS THERE EXISTS A WIDE GAP BETWEN HOW THE TOP ONE PER CENT THE ELEATES THINK THINGS SHOULD BE AND HOVE THE REST AMERICA LOOKS TO THEM SO HOW DO THEY TO FIND THE ALEATS THESE ERE BEU TO FINED AS PEOPLE HAVING AT LEAST ONE POST GRAD DEGREE OCCASE OF THSE ARE PEOPLE THAN SCRADUAY COLLEGE THEY HAVE A J D AN M B N M D EARNING AT LEAST A HUDRED FIFTY GRAND ANNUALLY LIVIN IN A HIGH POPULATION DENS TO TY AREA SAD BE LAKE A NEW YORK LAWYER WHO GRADUATED FROM AN JOY YOU OR SOMETHING AND THEN IN COMPARES WHAT THESE ELETES THINK TO WHAT THE REST OF AMERICA THINGS NWHUT THEY FIND IS THIS VAST DISCONNECTHE SERIOUS AND VAST DISCONNECT SO FOR EXAMPLE IN IN TIME WHEN MOST AMERICANS HAVE SUFFERED A LOSS OF REAL TAKE COMPAY SEVENTY FOUR PER CENTS OVY LETES SAY HEY ARE FINANCIALLY BETTER OFF TO DAY THAN I THE PAST FOR SU TWENTY PER CENT OF ALL AMERICANS AND THAT THIS CONNECT MAKE SENSE LOE TESE PEOPLE SAT HOME DURING COVEN AND THEY DID JUST FIND AND THEY DON'T REALY UNDERSTAND WHY OTHER PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT WAY I GOT THAT HAVE LOT OF FRIENDS WHO WHO MADE MONEY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BUT THAT'S NOT THE EXPERIENCE MOST AMERICANS THAT IS REALLY NOT THESE PRENCS AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAN Y U HAVE A DISCONNECT THE ENOUGH TO EXPERIENCEWHEN OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND THATG WHAT THEY'R SAYING IS CORRECT WHEN MOST AMERICAN SAY THE ECONOMY IS NOT WOOD FOR ME THEY ARE RIGHT THE ECONOMY IS NOT GOOD FOR THEM NEARLEYS SIX IN TEN OF THESE ALETES SAY THERE IS TOO MUCH INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IN AMERICA DOUBLE THE RATE OF ALL AMERICANS OHOW DO THEY GET TO THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF FREEDOM OF ANY SUBGROUP IN THE UNITED STATES THEY MORE MONITARY FREEDOM MANY OF THEM THEY HAVE MORE EDUCATIONAL FREEDOM THEY HAVE MORE FREEDOM TO MOVE ABOUT THEY HAVE MORE CHOICES IN LIFE PRESUMEBLY BUT THEY SAY THERE'S TOO MUCH INDIVIDUAL FEEDOM IN AMERICA WHY BECAUSE LIKE YOUVALL KNO HARATY THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT FREEDOM ISN'T INHERIT RIGHT BECAUSE RIGHTS ARE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONS THERE T THEIR STORIES THAT WE MAKE UP TO TELL OURSELVES TO NIGHT AND THESE ARE THE SOPHISTICATES AND THESE SOPHISTICATES ARE INTERESTED IN BUILDING A SYSTEM OF THEIR OWN MAKING FOR YOU  MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THESE PEOPLE FAVOR RATIONING A VITAL ENERGY AND FOOD SOURCES TO COMBAT THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN AVOID ALL OF THIS THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY SOULD GO BACK TO LIVING IN A NATURE OR PRESERVE OR LOG CABIN THEY MAY SAY THEY DO BES THEY ARE ACTUALLY HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW AND THAT SEEMS VERY FAR AWAY FRM THEM SO EASY FOR THEM TO SAY BUT THEY SAY THAT SORT OF STUFF AGAIN WHY BECAUSE TO THEM PROPERTY RIGHTS ORE KIND OF RELEVENT CAUSE THEY ALREADY OWN THE THINGS IN FACT THE PEOPLE W NEED PROPERTY WRITES THE MOST TYPICALLY ARE NOT T PEOPLE ARDY OWN BUT HE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO NEED TO OWN IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY CURRENTLY LIVE ANY TO MORE

OPINION OF THE SO CALLED TALKING PROFESSIONS BE LAWYERS LOBBIEST POLITICIONS AN JOURNALISTS NOW AGAIN I THINK NORMEES IN AMERICA LOOK AT THAT THE LIKE LAWYERS THOSE ARE PEOPLE MAKETINGS MORE COMPLICATING COSTRY MONEY LOBBIESTS THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR INDUSTRY AND THEN ENGAGE IN REGULAR FORY CAPTURE POLITICIANS THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO STAND IN THE WAY OF MY PROSPERITY JOURNALISTS ARE PEOPLE WHO LID TO ME HAV THIN ITS HOW MANY AMERICAN FEEL BOUT ER INSTITUTIONS RIGHT NOW BUT THE ELEDES BECAUSE THESE ARE THE CIRCLES IN WHICH THEY WALK HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN INSTITUTIONS THAT THE REST OF AMERICA HAS BEEN DISABUSED ABOUT WELL HERE IS THE THE KEY STATERE PRESENT AND BIDON HASN'NT EIGHTY FOR PER CENT JOB APPROVAL RATING FROM THIS GROUP THERE'S ROUGHLY TWICE AS HIGH AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT IS THAT IS A MASSIVE GAP A MASSIVE GAP AGAIN WHEN IT SAYS DOES THE UNITEDSTATES PROVIDE TOO MUCH INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT CONTROL ORS THE BOUNDS OFOUT RIGHT FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AMERICANS SAY ABOUT TOO MUCH CONTROL IVEY LY GRADUATES FIFTY FIVE PER CENTS A TO MUCH FREEDOM A THAT GAP TEFINDS THE BY DMINISTRATION THE BY NIMISTRATION IS DEFIND BY THIS GAP NOW AGAIN I THINK THAT NORMAL PEOPLE ARE NOT THINKING LIKE THIS O ON'T THINK NORMAL PEOPLE THINK THAT THINGS LIKE COUNTRY AND BORDERS ARE ARTIFICIAL ABSTRACTIONS CREATED OUT OF THIN AIR THEI'RE STORIES THAT WE JUST TELL OURSELVES ARBITRARY STORIES THAT WE CAN CHANGE AT ANY TIME AND IN FACT I THINK THAT THE STORIES THAT THAT REPLACE THOSE STORIES EVEN IF YOU BUY UVO NOHORARES FRAME WORKERE THE STORIES THAT ARE PLACE THOSS ORIES ARE MUCH WORSE THEN THE STORIES THAT IF HISTORICALLY BEEN AXCEPTED BY HUMAN BEINGS THE THE REPLACEMEN FOR STORIES ABOUT CHURCH FOR EXAMPLE HAS NOT BEEN A BETTER STORY THAT WE OLOSTOVS HAS BEEN A MUCH WORSE STORY THIS IS WHY IT IS FASCINATING DURING THAT DEBAT WITH DESTINY THE LIBERAL STREAMER THE THE QUESTION OF LOW BIRTH RATES CAME UP AND YOU VOL MO HORARI MIGHT HA WR LEATS BECAUSE OF A STORY THAT WE TELL OURSELVES ABOUT HUMAN FREEDOM IN CONTRACEPTIVE FREEDOM O GAT FINE BUT THE ANSWER TO THAT STORY IS THE BETTER STORY IN THAT THAT STORY COULD BE ANSWERED NOW WITH PUZZLEMENT AND BEWILDERMENT BUT WITH THE SIMPLE WITH THE SIMPLE THREE WORD ANSWER HER'S WHAT THAT SOUNDED LIKE THE ONE KIND OF WEIRD THING THAT WE ARE COMING UP AGAINST THAT WE HAVEBEEN COMING UP AGAINST A NOW FOR FIRS O NUMBER OF DEGATESBLE CONTINU TO IS A SOCIETYES PROGRESS SAMES LIKE PEOPLE ARE HAVING LAST CHILDREN AND I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HUN SET WHAT THE ANSWER IS TO THAT QUESTION A AN YOU AT II MEAN AN IMPLEMENTABLE ANSWER THAT WORKS THAT WE KNOW WE CAN GET ERYBODY ON BORD WITH BY THE NSWER MA M ANSWER WAS GOOD CHURCH FRILEGON  YES ACTUALLY YES NOW THERE'S TWO WAYS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIBERAL TO GET OUT OF THAT ONE IS TO SAY LET'S A STORY YOU TELL YOURSELF TO FALSE STORY AND SO WERE JUS NOT KING O DO IT THE OTHER WAY IS TO SAY WHALL MAYBE IF THE THING HAS WORKED OVER TIME IT IS WORTH ACTUALLY EXAMINING WHETHER IT IS A TRUE STORY MAYBE THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO THAT STORY BUT THAT'S THE THING THAT THEY LEADS CAN'T ABIDE BECAUSE IF THERE'S TRUTH TO MANY OF THE NARATIVES THET PRE EXISTS THEM THEN THEY GOT A PROBLEM IS TESE HARE THE INTELLECTUALS THESE OF THE POSTGRABS THESE OF PEOPLE HEARD THESE SUCCESSFUL ELEAD IN OUR SOCIETY THEY WANT TO RESTRUCTURE SOCIETY ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN STORY BUT WHAT IF THE STORY THAT PREEXISTS THEM WAS NOT IN ARBITRARY STORY MAYBE THAT STORY WAS THERE FOR A REASON ASHALLYOV ALL PEOPLE DEEM PHILIPS THE THE DEMOCRATIC MINISTOR TO CONGRESS PERSON I THINK ANDAM STUMBLED UPON THIS HE WAS JOUSTING WITH THE MEDIU HE'S RUN AGAINST JOBIDON IN QUIXOTIC CAMPAIGN IN NEW HAMPSURE AGAINST THE CRIN PRESIDENT BUT HE WENT OFF ON THE MEDIUBIES THE'RE ASKING MUCH QUESTIONS AND HE SAID LISTEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN ASKING THE QUESTIONS AMERICANS CARE ABOUT AND THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE HIS JOURNALISTS MANY OF THEM ARE PART OF THIS SELEAT COTERY WHO HAVE A DIFFERENT VALUE SISTEM FROM THE REST OF AMERICA SAYDIS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TIMES I'M ONLY DOING US TO THE FEET TOM TROM NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT TO DO THAT IN THE DEMOE CRATIC ARE YOU RGHT NOW OTHER THAN WE BECAUSE JU BITN CANT IS MIGHT PROPOSITION BECAUSE THE DAT IS AYS HE CANT NO ONE IN THE COUNTRY RIN OUT PERES AN TACT MOST OF PEOPLE THE COUNTRY GOING TO THE TROUB RALLY RIGHT NOW TUS HE'S LISTENING TO THEM NO ONE'S ASKING ABOUT THIS TO JUST FRUSTRATED OUT WE UNDERSTAND WHY I'M GETTING TIRED OF IT YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOBS BUT YOU'RE NOT ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT AMERICANS YOU  ABOUT HE HAPPENS TO BE CORRECT HE HAPPENS TO BE CORRECT DEMOCRATS ARE NOT GIVING ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THE AMERICANS CARE ABOUT AND JOURALIS AREN'TS EVEN ASKING THE QUESTIONS THE AMERICANS GIVE A CRAP TAT IN FACT THERE DEFINITION OF FREEDOM IS SO WILDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE DEFINITION THAT MOST AMERICANS HOLD THAT 'S GON TO GET TEM IN AN AWFUL LOUT OF TROUBLE SO FOR EXAMPLE SENTER TAMMY DUCKWORTH WAS ASKED WHET TWENTY TWENTY FOR WAS ABOUT AND SHE SAID FREEDOM ANS THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD HE MAN BY FREEDOM LISTENER ANSWER WHY THINK THAT ITS ABO FREEDOM RIGHT ITS BOUT PROTECTING A OUT TO BUT PROTECTING FREEDOMS AND ONE ABOUT CREEDINGS IS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL OUR BODIES AND CON TRO OR WIN PRODOUT TOR PCYCLES ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT TO THE FREEDOM FROM SODENT LOANS THE FREEDOM TO WALK ON THE STREETS AND AND NOT HAV TO WORRY ABOUT BEING TR RGIT OH RACEAL AS HA THOSE ARE ALL FREEDOMS THAN WE CONCERNIN TALK ABOUT AND I DO THINK AT FREE ON FORECING ON POLICY AND  AND DESCRIBING FREEDOM IN THOSE TARMS WOULD BE HELPFUL DESIMAZING HOW DOES SHOU DESCRIBED FREEDOM SHE NAMES THREE THINGS FREEDOM TO DO ABORTION WHICH AGAIN I THINK THERE A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO ARE NOT ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA THAT FREEDOM IS ABORTION MOST SHOCKING LYN SHE SAYS FREEDOM IS FREEDOM FROM STUDENT LONES AT'S AN AMAZING STATEMENT SO FREEDOM IS OTHER PEOPLE PAY YOUR BILLS AND THAT'S TRUE FREEDOM AND THAT'S THE ALEDE VERSION OF FREEDOM IF THAT'S THE SOCIETY THE HON STRUCTURE FREEDOMERS FROM RESPONSIBILITY SAY THEOLETS THAT'S ALMOST AMERICANS ARE TALKING ABOUT IF THAT'S THE DEMOCRATIC PROPOSITION FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR I THINK THAT THAT IS A VAST GAP FROM A MOST AMERICANS FEEL REMEMBER A FEW MONTHS BACK THERE WAS THIS SONG THAT WHEN ABSOLUTELY VIRAL AND AND THAT THAT SONG WHO'S OLIVER ANTHONY AND THE THE SONGS ALLED RICH MEN NORTH OF RICHMOND YOU'LL RECALL AND THE LURITS OF RICHMEND NORTH RICHMOND ABSOLUTELY PUZZLED MANY MEMBERS OF LEFT THE LITERALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IN THE SONG HE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE BASEDLY TAXING TO MUCH AND ALSO SPENDING TO MUCH MONEY AND HE TALKS ABOUT THE ABUSE OF WELFARE FOR EXAMPLE AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE SILY COTRI LIKE WHAT IS HE WINING ABOUT HE'S HE'S A BLUE COLLERED I SHOULD'T HE BE IN FAVER OF THAT SHOULDN'T HE WANT ARE RESTRUCTURED WAY OF LIFE AN WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS THE THINGS THAT MOST AMERICANS ACTUALLY CAREABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE THE STORIES THAT AVE ALWAYS WORK THE SORES ABOUT FAMILY AND FREEDOM AND THE ABILITY TO USE YOUR MERIT TO RISE TO THE TOP  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT HE SANG ABOUT WAS HE HE HE SAID IF YOU'RE FIVE

THEM DOWN AND PEOPLE LIKE WHIS HE WHISE HE DOING THE WELFARE QUEEN RE WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT MOST AMERICANS ACTUALLY ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE BASIC PROPOSITION THAT FREEDOM MEANS FREEDOM FROM STUDENT LONES FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IS JOBITON'S COR PROBLEM JOBINE IS NOT SPEAKING A LANGUAGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RECOGNIZE AND THATS GOINGTO COME BACK TO BYD MIN THABUT ALONG WITH HIS POLICY FAILURES WHICH

THAT FREE BOTTLE OF FIBER AND SPICE AGAY SO SPEAKING OF JOBIDON'S POLICY OU THE MOST UNDER COVERED STORY OF THIS OF THIS CYCLE THIS NEW CYCLE SO FAR IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TWO DEAD NAVY SEALS THE THIS ANNYLATE HOW IS THIS NOT THE BIGGEST STORY IN AMERICA SO THEST TWO NAVY SEALS ACTUALLY DIED THEYE WARE LOST IT SEA DURING AN OPERATION ATTEMPTING TO SEIZE ORONIAN MADE MISSILE PARTS THEYE ARE BOUND FOR WHO THE REBELS IN EMMON ALL THIS BY THE WAY AN OUTGROWTH OF THE GIGANTICALLY WEAK FORM POLICY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION WITH REGARD TUORON SENT COM SEDNESS TATEMENT THE MILITARY HAD DECLARED THE TWO DEALA SEALS DEAD IT WAS NOW CONDUCTING RECOVERY OPERATIONS FOLLOING A TEN DAY EXHAUSTED SEARCH THE SEARCH COVERD TWENTY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES APPARENTLY THE SEALS WERE REPORTED THE LOST EARLIER THIS MONTHWHEN THEY TOOK PART I AN IGHTTIME OPERATION TO BOARTEBOAT IN THE INTERNATIONAL WATERS OF THE ARABIAN SEA ACCORDING TO THE UUS MILITARY THAT IS AN ATTEMPT TO INSHURE FREEDOM OF SHIPPING WHICH HAS BEEN COMPLETELY OBSTRUCTED UNDER JOBIDON THROUGH THE RED SEA A JOBIDANS ATTEMPTS TO FIRE MISSILES THAT HIT CAMELS IN THE ASK HAS SO FAR HAD VERY LITTLE A FACT ON THE ACTUAL PREVENTION OF WHO THE TERROR ATTACKS ONSHIP IN WHICH CONTINUE UN ABATED MEANWHILE WE HAVE TWO AMERICANS DEAD IN N ATTEMPT TO STOP THE WHO THES WE HAVE OTHER AMERICANS WHAVE BEN SEVERELY WOUNDED INCLUDING ONE WITH APPARENTLY BRAIN INJURIES THANKS TO ARONIAN ATTACKS ON AMERICAN BASES IN A ROCH AND JOBIDNES IS TRYING TO WALK THROUGH THIS THING THERE IS JOBIDON LITERALLY JUST TRYING TO STUMBLE ACROSS GRASS AND AVOIDING QUESTIONSABOUT THESE TWO DEAD NAVY SEALS ERYLAFDON TRUM LIKES TO SAY LOOKING LIKE HES AT TRYING TO WALK ON TOOTHPICKS AND AGAIN ITS NOTCHUST THESE TWO DEAD NAVY SEALS ACCORDING TO THE WALSTER JOURNAL ARONAN BACK MILITIOUS LANCHED ANOTHER MISSILE AND ROCKET BRAGIA YOU UST FORCES IN A ROCK ON SATURDAY SEVERAL AMERICANS MAY HAV BEN INJURED WILL RON PAY ANY PRICE FOR THIS LATEST ASSAULT SNT COM SEDINESS TATEMENT MOST OF THE MISSILES WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE ALL ASIDE AR BASE ARE DOFEND SYSTEMS WHILE OTHERS IMPACTOD THE BASE DAMAGERCESSMENS ARE ON GOING AND ADDED A NUMBER OF YOSE PERSONAL ARE UNDER GOING A VALUATION FOR TROMATIC BRAIN INJURY AT LEAST ONE AROCKY SERVICE MEMBER WAS WOUNDED THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTYERSO ATTACK BY RONIAN BACK MALICIOS SINCE OCTOBERSEM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES IN A ROCK AND SERIA AND ALL THAT IS DESIGNS BUT PRESSURE ON THE UNITED STATES TO PUT PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO STOP AND LEAVE COMAS IN PLACE IN THE GODSTRIP AFTER THE WORST TERROR ATTACK ONJUS SINCE WORLD OR TOO NOW WHISE ALL THAT HAPPENING THE REASON ARON IS DOING THIS IS BECAUSE ARON BELIEVES THAT IN AN ELECTION EER GOBIDON IS SO ALL FIRED FRIGHTEN OF GETTING INTO A WARTHORON THAT THEY CAN PUSH THE UNITED STATES AROUND TO THE HARTS CONTENT THAT CAN SHUTOWN SHIPPING IN THE RED SEY THEYN CONTINUE O HAVE HIS BLL OFF FIRE MISSILES INTO LERN ISRAEL AND KILL JEWS THEY CAN CONTINUE TO FIRE DIRECTLY AT AMERICAN BASIS THEY NAVE THEIR PROXY FORCES FIRE DIRECTLY IN AMERICAN AIR BASIS IN A ROCH AND JOBIDON WELL RUN AWAY IN FACT THAT IS NOT A BAD ANALIYSIS BY THE ORONIANS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE JOBIDON IS PETER BAKER THE EUR TIMES REPORTS AS MUCH HE SAYS ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER BAROCH OF ROKETS AND ANOTHER SPARK THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS FURE COULD SET OFF A WILD FIRE OF VIOLENCE ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST THE ASSAULT ON AMERICAN TROUPS BASE AT ALL ASIDE AIR BASE IN WESTERN ROCK SATERY NIGHT WAS BY ONE MEASURE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BELIEVE TO BE CARRIED OUT BY A MILICIOUS SPONSER BI RON SINCE THE HAMAS TERRACE ATTACK ON ISRAEL ONTOBER SEVENTH TWO OUT OF THE INESTIMATED SEVENTEEN ROCKETS AN SHORT RANGEPALLISTIC MISSILES FIRE TO THE BASE MADE IT THROUGH ERRT DEFENS SYSTEMS AMERICAN FORCES HAVE THE TIMES AT MOUNTOV RETALIATIONS BUT IN LIMITED FASHION TO AVOID INSTIGATING A FULL FLEDGE CONFLICT BY DEMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE REGULARLY DEBATED THE PROPER STRATEGY THEY DON'T WANT LET SUCH A TAXK GO WITHOUT RESPONDSE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY N'T WANTON GO SO FAR THE CONFLICT WOULD ESSOLATE INTO A FULL FLEDGE WAR PARTICULARLY BY STRIKING ORON DIRECTLY THEY PRIVATELY SAY THEY MAY NOT HAVE NO CHOICE IF AMERICAN TROUPS ARE KILLED THAT'S A RED LINE THAT IS NOT BEN CROSS BUT I FARONUN BACK MILITIAS EVER HAVE A DAY OF BETTER AIM OR BETTER LUCK IT EASILY COULD BE WHAT HEU CALLING HAVE TWO DEAD NAVY SEALS IND AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE WHOO THES FROM SHIPPING A MUNCH OF MISSILES INTO THEIR TERRITORY AGAIN THE FEAR OF ARON IS DICTATING THIS ADMINISTRATIONS FORIN POLICY AND IV SICTATING ORON DIGRESSION NOW THE REALITY IS THAT ARON REALLY REALLY DIS NOT WANT ITS RECT WARD THE UNITED STATES BUT THEY DO WANTOD DO IS HUMILIATE THE UNITED STATES AND PRESSURE TH UNITED STATES IN OPRESSURING ISRAEL TO LEVING THEIR PROXY FORCE IN COMASS IN PLACE THAT IS THEIR GOALL BUT THERE'S AN ENTIRE ARTICLE N THE NER TIMES BY RULE MARKET GERRET AND RATE TAKE TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT ARON WANTS NOW WHAT THEY SAY CORRECTLY IS WHILE ARON IS CLEARLY ASSORTING ITS MILITARY STRENGTH AMID THE WIDENING REGIONAL TORMWEL THAT DOESN'T MEANIS LEADERS WANTO BE DRAWN INTO A WIDER WAR THEY'VE SAID AS MUCH PUBLICLY PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT THE METICULOUSLY AVOIDD TAKING DIRECT MILITARY ACTION AGAINST EITHER ISRAEL OR THE UNITED STATES THE REGIME APPEARS TO BE CONTENT FOR NOW TO LEANINSTO ITS LONG TIME STRATEGEO PROXY WARFARE THE GROUPS THEY BACK ARE FIGHTING ORONS FOSE SO FAR NEITHER ISRAEL NOR THE UNITED STATES HAS SIGNALED ANY INTEREST IN RETALIATING DIRECTLY WHY BUT BECAUSE THEI'RE AFRAID THAT IF THEY GO TO WAR IF THEY CAN LIKE A DIRECT FIRING WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES OR ISRAEL THEI'RE AFRAID THEIR THEIRISUME IS OVER THE ELDERLY SUPREME LEADER IATOLL OLICAMANI IS SEEKING TO SECURE HIS LEGACY THAT MEANS NOT GETTING DRAGGED INTO A WIDER WAR THER BUSILY ROUND DING UP PROTESTORS AN EXECUTING THEM RIGHT NOW SO NOW ORON DOESN'T WANT TO WAR CERTAINLY MORE THAN THAN THE WEST LES WL WANT TOE WORK BUT JOBID IS MAKING CLEAR JUST LIKE BAROCOBOMA DID IN TWENTY TWELVE TO THE RUSSIANS TYE IF YEU HAS ONE TO GET AGGRESSIVE LIKE NOW WOULD PROBABLY BE A BESTM BECAUSE IF YOU LIKE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME GET AGGRESSIVE WITH YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO GET REELECTED AND JOBIN'S BASELY SAYING THAT SOF ARONIANS IN THE ARNEUS LIKE WHALE THAT GIVES US A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY NOW THEIR COULD BE AMIS CALCULATION NEAR ORON COULD GO TO FIR IN THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE FORSE EVEN UNDER JOBIDON TO DO SOMETHING BUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO BE PREDICTABLY UNPREDICTABLE THE RES N' THY NEVER DID THIS UNDER TRUMP IS THAT THEY DID'T NOTE THE WHOLE TRUMP WAS GOING TO DO TRUMPITA FIRE TO MISSILE AND TAKEN OUT THE IATOAS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT NOBODY BELIEVES THAT BRIDON IS GOING TO DO THAT INSTEAD TOBIDON CONTINUES TO SIGNAL TO THE ARANIANS AND THEIR PROXIES THAT HE WILL IN FACT DO THEIR WORK THAT HE WILL IN FACT ATTEMPT TO LEVERAGE DOWN A BAD DEAL ON ISRAEL AFTER THE COMASS ATTACK ACCORDING TOTHE WALSTER JOURNAL A PROPOSALS SUBMITTED TO ISRALVIA THE UNITED STATES SUGGEST A POSTWAR GAZA THEL CRATE A PATHWAY TOWARD POLICINIAN STATE IN EXCHANGE FOR SOUTY RECOGNITION OF ISRAEL NOW THE REASON THAT TOTALLY INSANE IS BECAUSE IF ISRAEL GRANSA PATHWAY TO A PALISTINIAN STATE ON THE HEELS OF THE WORST TERROR ATTACKING IS RAILY HISTORY YOU ARE SIMPLY SAYING TO PEOPLE THAT IF THEY ATTACK YOU IN KILOSOPER CITIZENS YOU WILL GIVE THEM STUFF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING BY THE WAY COMOSS FOR ITS PART DOES'T EDN' WANT A SEAS FIRE ACCORDIG THE ASSOCIATE O PRESS COMMOSS WAS OFFERED A TWO MONTH FULL SEAS FIRE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF HIS RAILY HOSTAGES AND SOME PALCINIAN SECURITY PRISONERS BEING RELEASED AS WELL AND ALOWING COMOS LEADERS TO RELOCATE TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET OUT COMASS REJECTED BAT TO FOR ALL THE WE MUNICSEES FIRE ING OUT CROWD COMMOSS REJECTED TA SEAS FIRE AGAIN AND BIDAN'S WEAKNESS ON FOREIGN POLICY IS RADICALLY INCREASING THE RISK OF THE ACTUAL SERIOUS WAR IN THE MIDDALEAST MOVING BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY GOING ON OVER THERE AND IT'S NOT JUST OBVIOUSLY THE ADALEAST IS ALSO CONTINUED CASS ON OUR SOUTHERN WARALL GES THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST LADY BALLERS IS THE HILARIOUS STORY OF HOW GROUP OF MAL LOOSERS O COUNT WINNAGAIN SOUTHER MEN DECIDE TO IDENTIFIES WOMEN ENJOIN A WOMEN'S BASKETBOLLY YES IT'S ABSURD IT'S RIDICULOUS AND LAUGHABLE AND ALSO IT'S KIND OUT HAPPENING LIGHT RIGHT NOW THERE'S A QUICK LOOK AN WHT IS BEING CALED THE MOST TRIGGERING MOVIN OF THE DECATE LE SSRIANDINRR WA I SE THO LADY BALLERS WOBE MEEDS TO BE FAR FINGET T LOT IS SOTOLEVEN ETRIRSTREAMING EXCLUSIVELY ON DAILY WIRE PLUS DON'T WAIT WATCH LADY BALERS THE MOVY HOLLYWOUD DIDN'T MAKE SO WE DID EXCLUSIVELY AT DAILYWIRE PLUS RIGHT NOW MEANWHILE AGAIN DEMOCRATS ARE NOW CONNECTING WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SO THEY'RE TRYING TO WALK THEIR WAY PASS TO THE ISSUES THE LATEST EXAMPLE COMES CURTESY OF THE NEARTIMES SO THIS ISN'T ININTHING THE NEARATIMES PRINTED A PIECE IN WHICH THEY CLAIM THAT THERE IS BY PARTISAN PULLERISATION ROUND IMIGRATION SO THEREI TIMES RUNS THIS HEADLAND THINGS FALL APART HOW THE MIDDLE GROUND ON EMIGRATION COLLAPSE AND WHAT THEY SHOW IS PUE RESEARCH CENTRE POLLING WITH REGARD TO FEELINGS ABOUT ILLEGAL MIGRATION AND OPEN BORDERS AND FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE THE GRAPHIC THAT WERESHROWING RIGHT NOW IS WHY I SHOULD SUBSCRIBES SE CONNECTUALLY SEE IT BECAUSE IT'S HYSTERICALLY FUNNY BASICALLY WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT THE AMERICAN WRIGHT HAS HAD PERFECTLY CONSISTENT FEELINGS AND EMOGRATION SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FORT BUT WITH VERY LITTLE PLAN THE JOINES THAND WHEN WHEN ASKED WHETHER THEY SUPPORT BROADER AND LOOSER EMOGRATION ONLYABOUT THIRTY PER CENT REPUBLICANS SAID YES BACK IN NINETEEN NETY FOUR AND THAT NUMBER IS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT TO DAY AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN BETWEEN THOSE TO NUMBERS IS LIKE JUST A STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN NINETEN NINETY FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FOR DEMOCRATS THE NUMBER WHEN FROM THIRTY TWO PER CENT PRO MORE OPEN BORDERS TO EIGHTY THREE PER CENT TO DAY BUT WHAT THE NER TIMES DIT IS THEY DREW FEIGHT TREN LINES SUGGESTING THAT THERE WAS A RADICAL DE CREESE FORT REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR BORDERS EFER FOR OPEN BOARDERS AN ARADICAL IN CREASE FOR DEMOCRATS THAT'S NOT TRUE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY CONSISTENT FOR THIRTY YEARS ON THIS QUESTION DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN UTTERLY INCONSISTENT THEY'VE MOVE FROM THIRTY TWO PER CENT SUPPORT FROPEN BOARDERS TO EIGHTY THREE PERCENT SUPPORT FOR MORE OPEN BORDERS SO WHAT IS THE NER TIMES TRYING TO DO THERE TRYING TO PER TEND THAT THERE'S BEEN BY PART IS IN POLERIZATION WHEN IN FACT THERE HAS NOT WHEN IN FACT THE THE REALITY IS THAT DEMOCRATS ITH ONES WHO GOT MORRATICALLY CONTRIVE WHISTLINGYOR PAT WAY PAST THIS GRAVER BUT MAN IT IS A STUPID POLITICAL MOVE IN FACT FASCINATING PIECE OVER AT BARY WICES FREE PRESS TO DAY BY A REPORTER OLIVIAN RINGOLD TALANG ABOUT BLACK DEMOCRATS SUING CHICAGO OVER MIGRANS ACCORDING TO THE FREE PRESS BLACK RESIDENCE SAID THAT CHICAGO WHICH CALLS ITSELF WELCOMING CITY HAS BEEN VERY WELCOMING JUST NOT TO THEM SINCE OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO CHICAGO IS GREETED NEARLY THIRTY FIVE THOUSIN NEW ARRIVALS WITH HREESOURCES LIKE LANRY SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN RENTAL SUPPORT PER PERSON ALL FUNS THAT COULD AVE GONE A LONG WAY IN AMONSON PARK IN CHICAGOS AUSTIN DISTRICT WE'RE NERELY TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT OF RECENS LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE SO LACK DOCKTOBER A DAY BEFORE THE FIELD HOUSE WAS SEND TO COME A MIGRAN SHELTER A BLACK DEMOCRAT RUSH TO LOCAL COURT HOUSE ALONG WITH THREE OF HER EIGHBORS PLUSS THE HAD OF LOCAL AND ULACY P CHAPTER FOR MORAL SUPPORT AND THEN DRAFTED A LAWSUIT IN A NOBOOK RIPPED OUT THE PAGES IN HAND THEM DO CLER SO NOW BLACK DEMOCRATS ARE SUING OVER THIS AND WE SAY THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE ELEATS THAT RUN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE REST OF THE THE COUNTRY WEMAN LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THAT THIS CONNECT EXTENDS THREUG OUT AMERICAN POLICY AND THINGS ARE ONLY ANYAT WORSE BY THE WAY BECAUSE AGAIN WEAKENESS ON FORGN POLICY LEVEL IS LIKELY TO MAKE THINGS REALLY BAD ECONOMICALLY SPEAKING AGRIGT NOW FOR EXAMPLE CHINA COULD EFFECTIVELY QUARANTINE OR BLOCKADE TIWAN IS A POLE FROM AXIOS A AN EXPERT OPINION POL OND WHETHER BASION COUL EFFECTIVELY QUARANTINE BLOCKADE OR INVADE TIWAN ACCORDING TO THESE CUONQUA EXPERTS A LAW ENFORCEMENT LED QUARANTINE OF TIWAN ALMOST ALMOST NINETY PER CENT ROF AMERICAN EXPERTS STRONGLY AGREE OR SOMEWHAT AGREE THAT THERE COULD BE LAWENFORCEMENT LED QUARANTINE OF TIWAN HOW IT UP HAVE AT A CHINESE ARMY LED BLOCKADE OF TIWAN WELL VER EIGHTY PER CENTS OF YOU US EXPERTS BELIEVE THERE COULD BE NEFFECTIVE CHINESE LED BLOCKADE OF TIWAN HOW AN AM FIVIEST INVASION OF TIWAN WEL THAT THAT'S LESS LIKELY BECAUSE THAT WOUL INVOLVE MASDEATH BUT THEY DON'T NEED TO DO THAT A BLOCKADE WOULD DO IT A BLOCKADE OF TIWAN IN WHICH THE TIME LON STRATES ARE EFFECTIVELY CLOTHED TO ALL TRADE IN WHICH MICHROSHIPS JUST STOP BEING SHIPS ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE CHINA LOOKS AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE RED SEA AN THE SAY HELL THE MUNCH RAGTAG PIRATES CAN DO THAT INTHE RED SEA WHY CAN'T WE WITH A VERY VERY LARGE GRAY WATER AND NAVY AND A HUGE ARMY WHY CAUN'T WE DO THE SAME THING BLOCKADE TIWAN UNTIL THEY CRY UNCLE AND GIVE US SO MORE SOPHISTICATED MILITARY MICHROSHIPS WHY CAN'T WE ACTUALLY DO THIS NOW GAN THAT BLOCKADE WOULD BE INVOLVED BOTH COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY ACTIVITY THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER AREA FOR THE WORLD ECONOMY AND IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE LIKELY BECAS AND IMAGINE THIS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW MAY BE THE'RE HOLDING OUT FOR BIDAN VICTORY BECAUE THEY THINK OKAVE THEY GET A FULL SECOND TERM OF JOBIDAN THEY CAN PUSH HIM ROUND AS MUCH AS THEY WANT BUT WHA IF TONELS FROM IS LEADING AN A COUPLE MONTHS TO THEY JUST SAY YOU NOUGHT FORGET IT LET'S GULPHER BROKE AT THIS POINT INTERESTING ARTICLE OVER IT THE WALSTRY JOURNAL FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TALKING ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY A CHINESE BLOCKATE OF TIWAN WOULD MEAN FOR  GLOBLE BUSINESS AND THE ANSWERS A GIGANTIC DISASTER TIWON ACCOUNTS FOR OUGHLY SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE WORLDS AT MICHROSHIP SUPPLY IT'S ITS NEXT TO PACIFIC SHIPPING LANES THET CHANNEL SHRILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF TRADE FLOWING IN AND OUT OF ESTASIA CHINI A CHINESE BLOCKAD OF TIWAN WOULD RESULT IN SHIP SHORTAGES FOR CARSONAL ITRONIC TO DRIVE UP IN FLATIONARY PRESSURES AS WELL  PRETTY MUCH EVERY MAJOR INDUSTRY WOULD BE RATICALLY CHANGED BY SUCH A BLOCKADE AND THATS BECOMING MORE LIKELY EVERYDAY BECAUSE JOBIDON IS A WEAKLING BECAUSE HE IS A WEKLING AND HE'S BUSY WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THESE ELEATS WHOSE VALUE SYSTEM IS UNLIKE YOURS AND WHO ARE MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT SAY GLOBEL WARMING THAN THEY ARE ABOUT SAY GLOBAL TRADE CAND MEANWHILE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR AND THAT IS MY ANALYSIS OF THE OSCER NOMINATIONS I KNOW YOU ARE WAITING FOR THAT BECAUSE AFTER ALL WHO WASHES THE OSCARS ANY MORE BUT STILL I FEEL LIKE ITS WORTH WHILE TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE OSCRONOMINATIONS BECAUSE IT'S FUN TO SEA WHERE IN OLL PEOPLE WHO

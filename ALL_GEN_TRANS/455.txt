WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAPON O SCIENCE SCIENCE TAY TO S FOR  IMANDRUCUBERMEN AND OM OUR PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR ERIC JARVIS DOCTOR JARVIS'S A PROFESSOR AT THE ROCKOFELLER UNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK CITY AND HIS LABORATORY STUDIES THE NERBIOLOGY OF VOCAL LEARNING LANGUAGE SPEECH DISORDERS AND REMARKABLY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LANGUAGE MUSIC AND MOVEMENT IN PARTICULAR DANCE HIS WORK SPANDS FROM GENOMICS SO THE VERY GENES THAT MAKE UP OUR GENO AND THE GENOMES OF OTHER SPECIES THAT SPEAK AND HAVE LANGUAGE SUCH AS SONG BIRDS AND PARROTS ALL THE WAY UP TO NERL CIRCUITS THAT IS THE CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT GOVERN OUR ABILITY TO LEARN AND GENERATE SPECIFIC SOUNDS AND MOVEMENTS CORDINATED WITH THOSE SOUNDS INCLUDING HAND MOVEMENTS AND ALL THE WAY UP TO COGNITION THAT IS OUR ABILITY TO THINK IN SPECIFIC WAYS BASED ON WHAT WE ARE SAYING AND THE WAY THAT WE COMPREHEND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING SINGING AND DOING AS YOU'LL SOON SEE I WAS IMMEDIATELY TRANSFIXED AND ABSOLUTELY ENCHANTED BY DOCTOR JARVIS'S DESCRIPTION OF HIS WORK AND THE WAYS THAT IT IMPACTS ALL THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES FOR INSTANCE I LEARNED FROM DOCTOR JARVIS THAT AS WE READ WE ARE GENERATING VERY LOW LEVEL OF MOTOR ACTIVITY IN OUR THROAT THAT IS WE ARE SPEAKING THE WORDS THAT WE ARE READING AT A LEVEL BELOW THE PERCEPTION OF SOUND OR OUR OWN PERCEPTION OF THOSE WORDS BUT IF ONE WERE TO PUT AN AMPLIFIER R TO MEASURE THE FIRING OF THOSE MUSCLES IN OUR VOCAL CORDS WE'D FIND THAT AS WE'RE READING INFORMATION WE ARE ACTUALLY SPEAKING THAT INFORMATION AND AS I LEARN AND YOU'LL SOON LEARN THERE IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THOSE SPECIES IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE SONG AND MOVEMENT WHICH MANY OF US WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH DANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO LEARN AND GENERATE COMPLEX LANGUAGE SO FOR PEOPLE WITH SPEECH DISORDERS LIKE STUDDER OR FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MULTIBLE LANGUAGE LEARNING BY LINGUAL TRILINGUILL AT CETERA AND FRANKLY FOR ANY ONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN HOW WE COMMUNICATE THROUGH WORDS WRITTEN OR SPOKEN I AM CERTAIN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO BE AN ESPECIALLY INTERESTING AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR YOU DOCTOR JARVIS'S WORK IS SO PIONEERING THAT HE HAS BEEN AWARDED TRULY COUNTLESS AWARDS I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE OUR TIME TO LIST OFF ALL THE VARIOUS IMPORTANT AWARDS THAT HE IS RECEIVED BUT I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT IN ADDITION TO BEING A DECORATED PROFESSOR AT THE ROCKOFELLER UNIVERSITY HE IS ALSO AN INVESTIGATED WITH THE HOWARD HUGE'S MEDICAL INSTITUTE THE SO CALLED H H AM I AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW AG ITGUMI INVESTIGATORS ARE SELECTED ON AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE BASIS THAT THEY HAVE TO RE UP THAT IS THEY HAVE TO RECOMPETE EVERY FIVE YEARS THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVE A GRAD EVERY FIVE YEARS THAT DICTATES WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE NO LONGER A HOWARD HE IS INVESTIGATOR WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN ADVANCE TO ANOTHER FIVE YEARS OF FUNDING FOR THEIR IMPORTANT RESEARCH AND INDEED HOWARD HU'S INVESTIARS ARE SELECTED NOT JUST FOR THE RIGOR OF THEIR WORK BUT FOR THEIR PIONEERING SPIRIT AND THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE ON HIGH RISK HIGH BENEFIT WORK WHICH IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF WORK THAT DOCTOR JARVISS BITTEN PROVIDING FOR DECATES NOW AGAIN I THINK TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ONE OF THE MORE UNIQUE AND SPECIAL EPISODES THAT WE'VE HAD ON THE HUBRUMAN LAD PODCAST I SINGLE IT OUT BECAUSE IT REALLY SPANS FROM THE BASIC TO THE APPLIED AND DOCTOR JARVIS'S STORY IS IN ESPECIALLY UNIQUE ONE IN TERMS OF HOW HE ARRIVED AT BECOMING A NAROBIOLOGIST SO FOR THOSE OF ETHEIR INTERESTED IN PERSONAL JOURNEY AND PERSONAL STORY DOCTOR JARVISES IS TRULY A SPECIAL AND IMPORTANT ONE BEFORE E BEGIN I'D LIKE T EMPHISIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC ONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTOROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NIQUE TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TOLECTOROLIKTE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAAM OF SODIUM TWO UNDERMILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT PERSING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I 'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR ERIC JARVIS ERIC SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE THANK YOU VERY INTERESTED IN LEARNING FROM YOU ABOUT SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND EVEN AS I ASK THE QUESTION I REALIZE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF ILE DON'T FULLY APPRECIATE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SPEECH AND LANGUAGE MY SPEECH I THINK OF AS THE MOTOR PATTERNS THE THE PRODUCTION OF SOUND A THAT HAS MEANING HOPEFULLY AND LANGUAGE OF COURSE COME VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND VARIETIES OF WAYS OF COMMUNICATING BUT IN TERMS OF THE STUDY OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND THINKING ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN ORGANIZEHE SPEECH AND LANGUAGE A WHATER THE SIMILARITIES WHATE OF THE DIFFERENCES HOW SH WE THINK ABOUT SPEECH AND LANGUAGE YE I GLADU EVHURMOSELADTO GET THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH I CONSIDER I PROVOCATIVE ON REA THE REASON WHY I EEN STRUGGLING WHAT IT IS THE DIFFERENCE WITH SPEECH AND LANGUAGE MANY YEARS AND REALIZE WHY MI STRUGGLING IS BECAUSE THEIRE BEHAVIOURAL TERMS WAS CALLIN PSYCHOLOGICALLY PSYCHOLOGY DEVELOP KINDOF TERMS A THAT DON'T ACTUALLY A LINE EXACTLY WITH BRAIN FUNCTION I AND THE QUESTION IS THERE I DISTINCTION BETWEEN SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE BRAIN OF WORK THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE WORK WE HAVE DONE ALSO COMPARATED WITH ANIMAL MODELS LIKE THOSE WHO CAN IMITATE SOUNDS LIKE PARETS AND SOM BIRDS I SOUGHT TO SEE THERE REALLY ISN'T SUCH AY SHARP DISTINCTION SO SO TO GET AT WHAT I THINK IT'S GOING A LIME TELL YOU HOW SOME PEOPLE THINK OF IT NOW THAT THERE'S E SEPARATE LANGUAGE MODULE IN THE BRAIN THAT HAS ALL THE ALGWITHANS IN COMPUTATIONS THAT INFLUENCE THE SPEECH PATHWAY ON HOW TO PRODUCE SOUNDS AND THE AUDITORY PATHWAY ON HOW TO PERCEIVE AND INTERPRETED A FOR SPEECH OR FOR U KNOWS SOUND THAT WE COLL SPEECH ANDOUT IT TURNS OUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY GOOD EVIDENCE FOR A SEPARATE LANGUAGE MODULE INSTEAD THERE IS A SPEECH PRODUCTION PATHWAY THAT'S CONTROLLING OUT LARINGS CONTROLLING OUT JON MUSCLES THAT HAS BUILT WITHIN IT ALL THE COMPLEX ALGRETHANS FOR SPOKEN LANGUAGE AND THEREIS THE AUDITORY PATHWAY THAT HAS BUILT WITHIN IT ALL THE COMPLEX AGRETANS FOR UNDERSTANDING SPEECH NOT SEPARATE FROM A LANGUAGE MODULE AND THI SPEECH PRODUCTION PATHWAY E SPECIALIZED TO HUMANS AND PARITS AND SOM BIRDS WHERE IS THIS AUDITORY PERCEPTION PATHWAY IS MORE UBIQUITOUS AMONGST THE ANIMAL KINGDOM AND THIS IS WHY DOGS CAN UNDERSTAND SIT SEENT THEY SAY COME HERE BALL BOY GET THE BALL AND SO FOR DOGS CAN UNDERSTAND SEVERAL HUNDRED HUMAN SPEECHWORDS GREAT AITS YOU CAN TEACH THEM FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND BUT THEY CAN'T SAY A WORD FASCINATING BECAUSE YOU'VE RAISED A A NUMBER OF ANIMAL SPECIES EARLY ON HERE AND BECAUSE I HAVE A THEY SLEN AN OBSESSION WITH ANIMALS SINCE THE TIME WALLS VERY SMALL HAVE TO ASK A WHICH ANIMALS HAVE LANGUAGE WHICH IT ANIMALS HAVE MODES OF COMMUNICATION THAT ARE SORT OF LIKE LANGUAGE YE A YOUI'VE HEARD WHALE SONGS I KDON'T WHAT THEY'RE SAYING SOME VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT THEY COULD BE INSULTING EACH OTHER FOR ALL I KNOW AM AND THE VERY WELL MAY BE DOLPHINS BIRDS IN TE WHAT DO WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT MODES OF COMMUNICATION THAT ARE LIKE LANGUAGE WHAT MIGHT NOT BE WHAT WOULD CLASSICALLY BE CALLED LAA RIT SO SO MODES OF COMMUNICATION THAT PEOPLE WOULD DEFINE AS LANGUAGE MORSE VERY IN A VERY NARROW DEFINITION THEY WOULD SAY PRODUCTION OF SOUNDS OR SPEECH BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HANDS DIGESTURING WITH TH E HANDS WHAT ABOUT A BIRD WHO IS DOING AERIAL DISPLAYS IN THE YEAR COMMUNICATING INFORMATION THROUGH BODY LANGUAGE I WELL A I GONG TO GO BACK TO THE BRAING SO WHAT I THINK IT'S GOING ON IS FORESPOKEN LANGUAGE WERE USING THE SPEECH PATHWAY IN ALL THE COMPLEX ALGAMANS THER NEXT TO THE BRAIN REGIONS AT ARE CONTROLLING SPOKEN LANGUAGE WHIRE THE BRAIN REGIONS FOR GESTURING WITH THE HANDS AND THAT HAND PARALLEL PATHWAY HAS ALSO COMPLEX AGETHAN THAT WE CAN UTILIZE AND SOME SPECIES OR MORE ADVANCE IN THESE CIRCUITS WHETHER IT SOUND OR GESTURING WITH HANDS IN SOMEWHAT OR LESS ADVANCE NOW WE HUMANS IN A FEW OTHERS ARE THE MOST ADVANCE FOR THE SPEECH SOUNDS OR THE OR THE SPOKEN LANGUAGE BUT A NON HUMAN PRIMATE CAN PRODUCE GESTURING IN A MORE ADVANCE FORM THAN THEY COULD PRODUCE SOUNDS I'M NOT SURE AGOUT THAT O ACROSS CLEARLY JUST TO SAY THAT HUMANS ARE THE MOST ADVANCE AT SPOKEN LANGUAGE BUT NOT NECESSARILY AS BIG A DIFFERENCE AT GESTURAL LANGUAGE COMPARED TO SOME OF THE SPECIES VERY CLEAR AND VERY INTERESTING AND AND IMMEDIATELY PROMPTS THE QUESTION A HAVE THERE BEEN BRAIN IMAGING OR OTHER SORTS OF A STUDIES EVALUATING NORRAL ACTIVITY IN THE CONTEXTS OF YOU CULTURES AND LANGUAGES AT LEAST THAT I ASSOCIATE WITH A LOT OF HAND MOVEMENT LIKE A TALLIAN VERSIOUS A I DON'T KNOW  MAYE YOU COUL GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF CULTURES WHERE LANGUAGE S NOT A ASSOCIATED WITH WITH AS MUCH OVERT HAND MOVEMENT YES SO AS YOU AND I ARE TALKING HERE TO DAY AND PEOPLE WERE LISTENING BUT CAN'T SEE US WE'RE ACTUALLY GESTURING WITH OUR HANDS AS WE TALK A WITHOUT KNOWING IT OR DOING AN UNCONSCIOUSLY AND IF WE WERE TALKING ON A TELEPHONE I WOULD HAVE ONE HAND HERE AND I BE GESTURING WITH THE OTHER HAND WITHOUT EVEN YOU SEEING ME IHT AND SO WY IS THAT A SOME HAVE ARGUED AND I WOULD AGREE WITH BASE UPON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THERE IS AN EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BRAIN PATHWAYS THAT CONTROL SPEECH PRODUCTION AND GESTURING A AND IN THE BRAIN REGIONS I MENTION ARE DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO EACH OTHER AND WHIS AT I THINK THAT THE BRAIN PATHWAYS THAT CONTROL SPEECH EVOLVED OUT OF THE BRAIN PATHWAYS THAT CONTROL BODY MOVEMENT IT AND A THAT'S A WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ITALIAN FRENCH ENGLISH AND SO FORTH A EACH ONE OF THOSE LANGUAGES COME WITH A LEARNED SET OF GESTURES THAT ALL YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WASE NOW HOW IS THAT RELATED TO OTHER ANIMALS WILL COCO A GERILLA WHO IS RAISED WITH HUMANS FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS OR MORE A LEARNED HOW TO DO GESTURE COMMUNICATION LEARN HOW TO SIGN LANGUAGE SO TO SPEAK IT BUT COCO COULDN'T PRODUCE THOS SOUNDS COCO COULD UNDERSTAND THEM AS WELL BY SI BY SEEING SOMEBODYS SIGN OR HEARING SOMEBODY PRODUCE SPEECH BUT COCO COULDN'T PRODUCE IT WITH HER VOICE AND SO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IS THAT NUMBER SPECIES NOT ALL OF THEM NUMBER SPECIES HAVE MOTOR PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN WE CAN DO LEARNED JESTURING RUDIMENTARY LANGUAGE IF YOU WANTED SAVE WITH YURLANDS EVEN IF IT'S NOT AS ADVANCE AS HUMANS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THIS EXTRA BRAIN PATHWAY FOR THE SOUND SO THEY CAN'T GESTURE WITH THEIR VOICE IN THE WAY THAT THEY GESTURE WITH THEIR HANDS I SEE ONE THING THAT'V WONDERED ABOUT FOR VERY LONG TIME AS WHETHER OR NOT A PRIMITIVE EMOTIONS AND PRIMITIVE SOUNDS OR THE EARLY SUBSTRATE OF LANGUAGE AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A BRIDGE THAT WE CAN DRAW BETWEEN THOSE IN TERMS OF JUST THE BASIC RESPIRATION SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT EXTREME FEELINGS HER HEARSE THE WAY I'M IMAGINING THIS MIGHT WORK WHEN I SMELL SOMETHING DELICIOUS I TYPICALLY INHALE MORE AND I MIGHT SAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEREAS IF I SMELL SOMETHING PUTRED I TYPICALLY TURN AWAY I WINCE AND I WILL EXALE YOU KNOW IT SHOL COUNTA LIKE TURN AWAY TRYING TO NOT INGEST THOSE MOLECULES OR INHALE THOSE MOLECULES I COULD IMAGINE THAT THESE ARE THE BASIC DARK AND LIKE CONTRASTS OF THE OF THE LANGUAGE SYSTEM AND AS I SAY THAT I'M SAYING THAT FROM THE OR INTATION OF A VISION SCIENTISTS WHO THINKS OF ALL VISUAL IMAGES BUILT UP IN A BIVERY BASIC WAY OF A HIARCHICAL MAMODEL OF THE ABILITY SEE DARK IN LIGHT SO I COULD IMAGINE THIS KIND OF PRIMITIVE TO MORE SOPHISTICATED UM A PURAMID OF OF SOUND TO LANGUAGE THIS IS A CRAZY IDEA THAT WE HAVE ANY A DIO WE HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS  NO IT'S NOT A CRAZY IDEA AND IN FACT YOU HIT UPON ONE OF THE KEY DISTINCTIONS IN THE FIELD O RESERCE THAT I HAD STARTED OUT IN WHICH IS VOCAL LEARNING RESEARCH SO FOR VOCAL COMMUNICATION A YOU HAVE MOST BURDERATE SPECIES VOCALIZES BUT MOST OF THEM ARE PRODUCING INATE SOUNDS THAT THEY'RE BORN WITH A PRODUCING ATHAT IS BABIES CRYING FOR EXAMPLE OR DOG'S BARKING AND ONLY A FEW SPECIES HAVE LEARNED VOCAL COMMUNICATION THE ABILITY TO IMITATE SOUNDS AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES SPOKEN LANGUAGE SPECIAL HEN PEOPLE THINK OF WHAT SPECIAL ABOUT LANGUAGE IT'S THE LEARN VOCALISATIONS IT'S WHAT THAT IS WHAT'S RARE AND SO THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN INATENESS AND LEARNED A IS MORE OF A BIGOR DICONOMY WHEN IT COMES TO VOCALIZATIONS THAND FOR OTHER BEHAVIORS IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM AND THAWHEN YOU GO IN THE BRAIN YOU SEE IT THERE IS WELL AND SO ALL THE THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BREATHING THE GRUNTING AND SO FORTH A LOT OF THAT IS HANDLED BY THE BRAINSTEM CIRCUITS YOU KNOW RIGHT AROUND THE LEVEL OF YOUR NECK AND BELOW A LIKE A REFLEX IN O THING SO OR OR EVEN SOME EMOTIONAL ASPECTS OF YOUR BEHAVIOR IN THE HYPOTHELEMINTS AND SO FORTH BUT FOR LEARNED BEHAVIOR LEARNING HOW TO SPEAK  LEARNING HOW TO PLAY THE PIANO TEACHING A DOG TO LEARN HOW TO DO TRICKS IS USING THE FOUR BRAIN CIRCUITS AND WHAT HAS HAPPENE IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FOUR BRAINS CIRCUITS THAT ARE CONTROLLING LEARNING HOW TO MOVE BODY PARTS IN THESE SPECIES BUT NOT FOR THE VOCALSACIONS BUT IN HUMANS AND IN PARIS IN SOME OTHER SPECIES SOMEHOW WE ACQUIRED CIRCUITS WHERE THE FORBRAIN HAS TAKEN OVER THE BRAINSTEM AND NOW USING THAT BRAINS TOM NOT ONLY TO PRODUCE THE INATE BEHAVIORS OR VOCALBEHERS BUT THE LEARNED ONES AS WELL TO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHEN MODERN OR SOPHISTICATED LANGUAGE EVOLVED YOU KNOW THAT THINKING BACK TO THE SPECIES THAT WE HAVE ALL FROM AND EVEN WITHIN HOMOSAPIANS AN AHAS THERE BEEN AN EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE HASN'T BEEN A A DEVOLUTION OF ANGUAGE YE YET YET I I WOULD SAY A AND ND TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT DOES COME WITH THE CAVIAT THAT I THINK WE HUMANS OVERATE OURSELVES WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER SPECIES AND SO IT MAKES A EVEN SCIENTES A GO ASTRAN IN TRYING TO HYPOTHESIZE WHEN YOU SUSHY DON'T FIND FOSSIL EVIDENCE OF LANGUAGES UNEASILY A A IN OUT THERE IN IN TERNS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST A WE PROPI AMONGST THE PRIMATES WHICH WE HUMANS BELONG TO WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE THIS AVANCE VOCAL LEARNING ABILITY A NOW WHEN YOU IT WAS ASSUMED THAT IT WAS ONLY HOMOSAPITS A THEN YOU CAN GO BACK IN TIME NOW BASE UPON GENOMIC DATA NOT ONLY OF US LIVING HUMANS BUT OF THE FOSSILS THAT ARE BEEN FOUND FOR HOMOSAPIANS A THEANDITHALS OF DENISOV AND  INDIVIDUALS AND DISCOVER THAT OUR ANCESTOR OUR HUMAN ANCESTORS SUPPOSEDLY HYBRADIZE WITH THESE OTHER HOMETED SPECIES AND IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THESE OTHER HOMINATE SPECIES DON'T LEARN HOW TO IMITATE SOUNDS I DON'T KNOW F ANY SPECIES TO DAY THAT' THE VOCAL LEARNER THAT CAN HAVE CHILDREN WITH THE NON VOCAL LEARNING SPECIES I I DON'T SAY IT DOESN'T MEAN IT DID IT EXISTS AND WHENWE LOOK AT THE GENATIC DATA FROM THESE ANCESTRAL HOMETES THATS A YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT GENES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN LEARN VOCAN COMMUNICACION THEY HAVE THE SAME SEQUENCE AS WE HUMAN DUE FIRT GENES AT FUNCTION IN SPEECH CIRCUITS SO I THINK NEANITHOLS HAD SPOKEN LANGUAGE NO CAN TO SAY IT'S AS ADVANCE AS WHAT IT IS IN HUMANS I DON'T NOW BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN THERE FOR LEAST BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A MILLION ARS A THAT OOUR ANCESTORS HAD THIS ABILITY AND THAT WE BEEN COMING MORE AND MORE ADVANCED WITH THE CULTURALLY AND PROT POSSIBLY GENETICALLY A BUT I THINK IT'S ENVOLVED SOME TIME THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TOA MILIONARS INCREDIBLE YU COULD TALK A LOL BIT MORE ABOUT THE OVERLAP BETWEEN BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL LANGUAGE AND SPEECH IN HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS A YOU I WAS WEANED IN THE THAT NEROU SCIENCE YOURE AWARE BIRD SONG AND THE A THE ABILITY OF BIRDS TO LEARNED THEIR TUTOR SONG WAS AT WASN'T STILL IS A PROMINENT FIELD A SUBFIELD OF NERR SCIENCE AND THEN OF COURSE NOR IMAGING OF A HUMANS O SPEAKING AND LEARNING ET CETERA AND THIS NOTION OF A CRITICAL PERIOD A TIME IN WHICH LANGUAGE IS LEARNED MORE EASILY THAN IT IS LATER IN LIFE AND THE NAMES OF THE DIFFEREN BRAINAREAS WERE QUITE DIFFERENT A IT ONE OPENS THE TEXT BOOKS WE HEAR VERNICKIESAND BROKE US FOR THE HUMANS ANMY LOOK AT THE BIRDS OF IT I REMEMBER YOUNA FANCY AV ROBUST AR TRADE O MARY ACTS TATRIT YE ET CETERA BUT A FOR MOST OF OUR LISTENERS HAT THOSE NAMES WON'T MEAN A WHOLE LOT BUT A BUT IN TERMS OF HOMOLOGIES BETWEEN AREAS AND TERMS OF FUNCTION WHAT WE KNOW AND A HOW SIMILAR DIFFERENT AR THE BRAINS A BRAINARIES CONTROLLING O SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND SAY A SONG BIRD AND AT AN A YOUNG CHOP HUMAN CHILD YE SO SO GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES OR AN EVEN LOY A PETERMOLER AND OTHERS WHO GOT INVOLVED IN NERROW EUTHOLOGY THE STUDY  NORBIOLGY OF BEHAVIOUR IN THE NATURAL WAY  A YOU HAVE THE SART TO FIND THAT BEHAVIOURLING THERE THESE SPECIES OF BIRDS LIKE SOMBIRDS AND PARITS AND NOW WE ALSO KNOW HUMMING BIRDS JUST THREE OF THEM OUT OF THE FORTY SOMETHING BIRD GRIBS OUT THERE IN THE PLANET ORDERS THAT THEY CAN IMITATE SOUNDS LIKE WE DO AND SO THAT WAS DISSIMILARITY INOTHER WORDS THEY HAD THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOUR THAT'S MORE SIMILAR TO US THAN CHAMPANS ESE HAVE WITH US OR THAN CHICKENS HAVE WITH THEM  THEIR CLOSER RELATIVES AND THEN THEY DISCOVERED EVEN MORE SIMILARITIES THESE CRITICAL PERIODS THAT IF YOU REMOVE A CHILD YO THIS UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENS WHERE A CHILD IS FERO AN THAT IS NOT RAISED WITH HUMAN AND GOES TO THEIR PUBITY FASE OF GROWTH BECOMES HARD IN LEARNN A LANGUAGE AS AN ADULT SO THERE'S DIS CRITICAL PERIOD WHERE YOU LEARNED BEST AND EVEN LATER ON WHEN YOU ARE INREGULAR SOCIETY ITS HART TO LEARN WHILE THE SANT BIRDS UNDERGO THESE SAME THING AND THEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT IF THEY BECOME DEAF WE HUMANS BECOME DEF OUR SPEED STARTS TO DETERIATE WITHTHOUT ANY KIND OF THERAPY A IF ANONHUMAN PRIMATE OR A YOU KNOW OR WOULD SAY A CHICKEN BECOMES DEAF A THEIR VOCALIZATIONS DON'T DETERIA VERY LITTLE AT LEAST AWHILE THIS HAPPENS IN THE VOCA LEARNING BIRDS SO THEY WERE ALL THESE BEHAVIOR OF PARALLELS THAT CAME ALONG IN TO PACKAGE AND THEN PEOPLE LOOKED INTO THE BRAIN FOR NANDONATAMA MY FORMER PAAGY ADVISOR AND BEGAN TO DISCOVER THE AREA AX YOU TALKED ABOUT A THE ROBUST NICLIOUS OF THE ARCOPALIUM AND ZA AND THESE BRAIN PATHWAYS WERE NOT FOUND IN THE SPECIES WHOF CUNNINT IMITATES SO THERE WIS A PARALLEL HERE AND THEN A JUMPING MANY YEARS LATER YOU I STARTED TO DING DOWN INTO THESE A BRAIN CIRCUITS TO DISCOVER THAT THESE BRAINSCIRCUITS HAVE PARALLEL FUNCTIONS WITH THE BRAIN CIRCUITS FOR HUMANS EVEN THOUGH THEREBY A DIFFERENT NAME LIKE BROKAS AND LORINGIMOTA QARTEX AND MOST RECENTLY WE DISCOVERED NOT ONLY THE ACTUAL CIRCUITRY IN A CONNECTIVITY AR SIMILAR BUT THE UNDERLYING GENES THAT ARE EXPRESS IN THESE BRAIN REGIONS IN A SPECIALIZED WAY DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE BRAIN ARE ALSO SIMILAR BETWEEN HUMANS AND SOMBERS AND PARIS SO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GENES AN NOW REFINDING THE SPECIFIC MUTATIONS OR ALSO SIMILAR NOT ALWAYS IDENTICAL BUT SIMILAR  WHICH INDICATES REMARKABLE CONVERGENS FOR SO CALLED COMPLEX BEHAVIOR IN SPECIES SEPARATED BY THREE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS FROM E COMMON ANCESTOR AND NOT ONLY THAT WE ARE DISCOVERING THAT MUTATIONS IN THESE GENES THAT CAUSED SPEECH DEPACITS IN HUMANS LIKAN FOXPY TOO A IF YOU PUT THOSE SAME MUTATIONS OR SIMILAR TYPE OF DEPACITS IN THESE VOCAL LEANING BIRDS YOU GETS SIMILAR DEFAITS SO CONVERGENTS OF THE BEHAVIOR IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR GENETIC DISORDERS OF THE BEHAVIOR INCREDIBLE I HAVE TO ASK DO HMMING BIRD SINGER DO THEY HUM HUMMING BIRDS HUM WITH THEIR WINGS AND SING WITH THEIR CYRICS IN A CORDINATED WAY IN E CORDINATED WAY THERE'S SOME SPECIES OF HUMMING BIRDS A THAT ACTUALLY WO A DUG ASHELRS SHOW THIS THET WILL FLAP A THEIR WINGS AND CRATE A SLAPPING SOUND WITH THEIR WINGS THAT IN UNISON WITH THEIR SONG AND O AND YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IT BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE OF PARTICULAR SYLLABLE IN THEIR SONGS A EVEN THOUGH IT'S THEIR WINGS AND THEIR VOICE AT THE SAME TIME HUMMING BIRDS ARE CLAPPING TO THEIR SONG CLAPPING WITH THEIR THEIR SNAPPING THEIR WINGS TOGETHER A IN UNISON WITH THE SONG TO TO MAKE IT LIKE IF I'M GOING TOT OT THAT HT BT THAT YOU KNOW I BANGED ON THE TABLE EXCEPT THEY MAKE IT ALMOST SOUND LIKE THEIR VOICE WITH THEIR WINGS INCREDIBLE YES II'M WHEN THEY GOT SOME OF THE SMALLES TA RING AN TOS HAY MINE BELONG YAT I ES INCREDIBLE YES CUD  Y LOVE HUMMING BIRDS AND I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IT SUCH A A SPECIAL THING TO GET A MOMENT TO SEE WHONEM AS THEY MOVE AROUND SO FASCIN AY FLIT AWAY SONFASTENES BOLISTIC TRAJECTORIES YE THAT WHEN YOU GET TO SEE ONE STATIONARY FOR A MOMENT OR EVEN JUST HOVERING THERE IT'S A YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR EXTRACTING SO MUCH FROM THERE WILL LO BICOR COSM OF LIFE BUT NOW I REALIZE THEIR THEIR PLAYING MUSIC  RISEACTLY AND WHAT'S AMAZING O ABOUT HUMMING BIRDS AND I CAN SAY VOCAL LEARNING SPECIES IN GENERAL IS THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY SEEM TO EVO MULTIPLE COMPLEX TRAITS YOU AVE THIS IDEA THAT REVOLVING LANGUAGE SPOKEN LANGUAGE IN PARTICULAR COMES ALONG WITH A SAID OF SPECIALIZACIONS CREDIBLE WHEN I WAS COMING UP IN NER SCIENCE I LEARNED THAT I THINK IT WAS THE WORK OF PETER MARLOR THAT AM YOUNG BIRDS LEARN SONG BIRDS LEARN THEIR TUTOR SONG AND LEARN IT QUITE QUITE WELL BUT THAT THEY COULD LEARN THE SONG OF A NOTHER TUTOR AND OTHER WARS THEY COULD LEARN A DIFFERENT AND FOR THE LISTENERS I'M DOING AIR QUOTES HER A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE A DIFFERENT BIRD SONG INDIFFERENT IN THEIR OWN SPECIES YET BUT NEVER AS WELL AS THEY COULD LEARN THEIR OWN NATURAL GENETICLLY LINKE SONG YES GENICALLY LENT MEANING THAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE ME BEING RAISED IN A DIFFERENT CULTURE AND AM THAT I WOULD LEARN THAT THE OTHER LANGUAGE BUT NOT AS WELL AS I WOULD HAVE LEARNED ENGLISH THIS TIS IS THE IDEA YES IS THAT TRUE THAT IS TRUE YES AND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT I LEARN GROWING UP AS WELL AND D AND TALK TO PETER MOLLER HIMSELF ABOUT BEFORE HE PASSE AM YET THIS HE USED TO CALL IT THE INATE PREDISPOSITION TO LEARN IHT SO AM WHICH WOULD BE KIND OF THE EQUIVALENT IN THE LINGUISIC COMMUNITY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR THERE IS SOMETHING GENATICLY INFLUENCING OUR VOCAL COMMUNICATION ON TOP OF WHAT WE LEARN CULTURALLY AND SO THERE IS THIS BEEN BALANCE BETWEEN THE GENETIC CONTROL OF SPEECH OR A SONG IN THESE BIRDS AND THE LEARN A CULTURAL CONTROL AND SO SO YES IF YOU WERE TO TAKE AM YOU KNOW AM I MEAN THIS CASE WE WE ACTUALLY TRIED THIS AT ROCKERFELLER LATER AND TAKE A ZEBRFINCH AND RAISE IT WITH A CANARY IT WOULD SING A SONG THAT WA SORT OF LIKE A HIGBRIDING BETWEEN WE CALL IT A CANINCH I A ADVICE VERSIVE FOR THE CANARY BECAUSE THEF SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THEIR VOCAL MUSCULATURE OF THEIN OR THE CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN AND WOUT IS EBERFINCH EVEN WITH A CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES IF YOU WOULD TAKE A ZEBEFINCH A YOUNG ANIMAL AND IN ONE CAGE NEXT TO A PLACE ITS OWN SPECIES ADULT MAL I AND IN THE OTHER CAGE PLACE  BANGALEESFINCH NEXT TO IT IT WOULD PREFERABLY LEARN THE SONG FROM ITS OWN SPECIES NEIGHBOR BUT IF YOUE REMOVE ITS NEIGHBOR IT WOULD LEARN THAT BANGLEESMENT VERY WELL FANTAST SO THERE'S IT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO IT ALSO THE SOCIAL BONDING WITH YOUR OWN SPECIES CREDIBLE THAT RAISE IS A QUESTION THAT I BASE SONESOME THIYG I ALSO HEARD BUT IY WON'T HAVE ANY A SCIENTIFIC PURE REVIEWED PUBLICATION A POINT TO WHICH IS THIS THIS IDEAAF PIGEON NOT THE BIRD BUT THIS IDEA OF WHEN MULTIVUL CULTURES AND LANGUAGES CONVERGE IN A GIVEN GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE DIFFERENT NATIVE LANGUAGES WILL COME UP WITH THEIR OWN LANGUAGE I THINK ITS WAS IN ISLAND CULTURE MAY BE IN WHY CALLED PIGEON WHICH IS SORT OF A HYBRADE OF THE VARIOUS LANGUAGES THAT THEIR PARENT SPEAK AT HOME AND THAT THEY THEMSELVES SPEAK AND THAT SOMEHOW PIGEON AGAIN NOT THE BIRD WHAT A LANGUAGE CALLED PIGEON FOR REASONS I DON'T KNOW HARBORS CERTAIN BASIC ELEMENTS OF ALL LANGUAGE IS THAT TRUE IS THAT NOT TRUE I I I WOULD I HAVEN'T STUDIED ENOUGH MYSELF IN I TERMS OF PIGEON SPECIFICALLY BUT IN TURNS OF CULTURAL EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE AND HYBONIZATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT CULTURES AND SO FORTH A EVEN AMONGST BIRDS WITH DIFFERENT DIALECTS AN YOU BRING THEM TOGETHER A YOU WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS CULTURAL EVOLUTION REMARKABLY TRACTS GENETIC EVOLUTION SO OF YOU BRING PEOPLE FROM TWO SEPARATE POPULATIONS TOGETHER THET HAVE BEEN IN THEIR SEPARATE POPULATIONS EVOLUTIONARILYLEAS FOR HUNDREDS OF GENERATIONS SO SOME ONE SPEAKING CHINESE SO UN SPEAKING ENGLISH AAND THAT CHILD AHENS LEARNING FROM BOTH OF THEM YES THAT CHILD'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP AND MERGE OF A O FUNANDS AND WORDS TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT IN ADULT WOODEDS BECAUSE WHY THEIR EXPERIENCING BOTH LANGUAGES AT THE SAME TIME DURING THEIR CRITICAL PERIOD A YEARS IN A WAY THAT A DULTS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE AND SO YOU GET A HYBRAD AND THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATORS GOING TO BE WHAT THEY SHARE AND SO THE FUN INS THAT THEYE RETAINED IN EACH OF THEIR AA LANGUAGES IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE I IMAGINE USE THE MOST INTERESTING SO WE'VE GOT BRAIN CIRCUITS IN SONGBIRDS AND INHUMANS THAT IN MANY WAYS ARE SIMILAR PERHAPS NOT IN THEIR EXACT WIRING WHAT IN THEIR BASIC CONTOUR OF WIRING AND GENES THAT ARE EXPRESSED IN BOTH SETS OF NORAL CIRCUITS IN VERY DISTINCT SPECIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE THESE PHENOMENON RECALLING SPEECH AND LANGUAGE WHAT SORTS OF THINGS ARE THOSE GENES CONTROLLING WHAT'S I COULD IMAGINE THEY WERE CONTROLING THE WIRING OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BRAIN ARAS AND NOW ESSENTIALLY A MAP OF YOU KNOW OF A CIRCUIT I SILL LIKE AN ENGINEER WHICH INA CIRCUIT FOR SPEECH AND LANGUAGE NATURE DESIGNE THE SCIR CIR FOR SPEECH AND LANGUAGE BUT PRESUMELY OTHER THINGS TO LIKE THE ABILITY TO A CONNECT MO MOTOR PATTERNS WITHIN THE THROAT OF MUSCLES WITHIN THE THROAT WEN THE CONTROL THE TONGUE AND WHAT AT WHAT ARE THESE GENES DOING YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD YET YOUE MADE SOME VERY GOOD GUESSES THERE THAT A MAKE SENSE A SO SO YES OF WONE OF THE THINGS THAT DIFFER IN THE SPEECH PATHWAYS OF US IN THESE SON PATHWAYS OF BIRDS IS SOME OF THEIR CONNECTIONS OF FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FRIN THE SURROUNDING CIRCUITS LIKE AY OM A DIRECT CORTICAL CONNECTION OF FROM THE AREAS THAT CONTROL VOCALIZATIONS IN THE CARTZEX N TO MOTONERONS THAT CONTROL THE LARI IN A HUMANS OR THE SEARINGS AND BIRDS AND SO WE ACTULLY MADE A PREDICTION  THAT SINCE SOME OF THESE CONNECTIONS DIFFER VERE GNFINE GENES THAT THE THAT CONTROL NURRER CONNECTIVITY IN THAT SPECIALIZING THAT FUNCTION THAT DIFFER AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE FOUND I THE GNES THAT CONTROL WHAT WE CALLED ACTS ON GUIDINGS AND FORMENCION CONNECTIONS AND WHAT WAS INTERESTING IT WAS SOR IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAN WE EXPECTED THAT IS SOME OF THESE GENES ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF THEM THAT CONTROL NURROR CONNECTIVITY WERE TURNED OFF IN THE SPEECH CIRCUIT I IND IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO US AT FIRST AND SO WE SORRY TO REALIZE THE FUNCTION OF THESE GENES ARE TO REPELL CONNECTIONS FROM FORMING SO REPULSIVE MOLECULES AND SO WHEN YOU TURN THEM OFF THEY ALLOW CERTAIN CONNECTIONS TO FORM THAT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE NOT FORMED SO ITS SO BY TURNING IN OFF YOU GOUT O GAIN OF FUNCTION FOR SPEECH I IM A OTHER GENES THAT SURPRISE US WER GENES INVOLVED IN COUSING BUFFERING NEUROW PROTECTION LIKE A HARVAVEMEN OR HEAT SHOCK PROATINGS SO WHEN YOUR BRAIN GETS HOT THESE PROATINGS TURN ON AND WE COULDN'T FICK OUT FOR A LONG TIME WHY IS AT THE CASE AND THEN THE IDEA POP TO ME ONE DAYS THAIT AH E I HEARD THE LARINGS IS THE FASTEST FIRING MUSCLES IN THE BODY I IN ORDER TO VIBRATE SOUND AND AND MODULATE SOUND IN THE WAY WE DO YOU HAVE TO CONTROL YOU HAVE TO MOVE THOSE MUSCLES YOU KNOW THREE TO FOUR TO FIVE TIMES FASTER THAN JUST REGULAR WOLKING AR RUNNING AND SO A WHEN YOU STICK ELECTRODES IN IN THE BRAIN AIRIES THAT CONTROL LEARNED VOCLIZATIONS IN THESE BIRDS AND I THINK IN HUMANS AS WELL OF THOSE NURNS OF FIRING AT A HIGHER RATE TO CONTROL THESE MUSCLES AND SO WHAT IS THAT GOING TO DO YOU GANG TO HAVE LOTS OF TOCICITY IN THOSE NURONS UNLESS YOU UPREGULATE MOLEULS THAT TAKE OUT A THE EXTRA LOAD THAT IS NEEDED TO CONTROL THE LARINGS AND THEN FINALLY A THIRD SET OF GENES THAT AR SPECIALIZING THESE SPEET CIRCUIT ARE INVOLVED IN NEURO PLASTICITY ANEURO PLASTICITY MEANING ALLOWING THE BRAIN CIRCUITS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE A SO YOU CAN LEARN BETTER AND WHY IS THAT I THINK LEARNING HOW TO PREDUCE SPEECH IS THE MORE COMPLEX LEARNING ABILITY THEN SAY LEARNING HOW TO WOLF OR OR LEARNING HOW TO DO TRICKS AND JUMPS AND SO FORTH THE DOGS DO IT'S INTERESTSANG AS YOU SHAY THAT BECAUSE I I REALIZE THAT MANY ASPECTS OF SPEECH ARE SORT OF REFLECTIVE IM NOT THINKING ABOUT EACH WORD I'M WHEN TO SAY I DID THEY JUST STOR TO ROLL OUT OF MYR MOUTH HOPEFULLY WITH SOME FOR THOUGHT WE BOTH KNOW PEOPLE THAT A THEY SEEM TO SPEAK A THINK LASS FEWERE SNNAPSENS BETWEEN THEIR BRAIN AND THEIR MOUTH HAN I OTS RIGHT LOT OF EXAMPLES OUT THERE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY DELIBERATE IN THEIR SPEECH BUT NONE THE LESS THAT A MUCH OF SPEECH IS A HAS TO BE PRECISE AND A SOME OF IT LESS PRECISE IN TERMS OF PLASTICITY OF SPEECH AND THE ILITY TO LEARN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES BUT EVEN JUST ONE LANGUAGE WHAT'S SGOING ON IN THE CRITICAL PERE THE SO CALLED CRITICAL PERIOD YE WHY IS IT THAT  SO MY NIECE SPEAKS SPANISH SQUATOM ALL AND SPEAK SPANISH AND ENGUISH INCREDIBLY WELL SHE'S FOURTEEN YEARS OLPI'VE STRUGGLE WA SPANISH MY WHOLE LIFE MY FATHER'S BY LANGUO MY MOTHER IS NOT I'VE TRIED TO LEARN SPANISHS AS AN ADULT IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING I'M TOLD THAT A I LEARNED IT WHEN I WAS EIGHT I WOULD BE BETTER OFF ATOR AM OR IT WOULD BE INSTALLED WITHIN ME SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS IS IT EASIER TO LEARN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES WITHOUT AN ACCENT EARLY IN LIFE AND IF SO WHY AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS IF ONE CAN ALREADY SPEAK MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CHILDHOOD LEARNING IS IT EASIER TO ACQUIRE NEW LANGUAGES LATER ON SO SO THE ANSWER TO BOTH OF HIS QUESTIONS IS YES AND THAT A BUT I BUT I BUT TO TO EXPLAIN THIS I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE BRAIN  IS UNDERGOING A CRITICAL PERIOD DEVELOPMENTS NOT JUST TO SPEECH PATHWAYS AND DOS SO IT'S EASIER TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY A PIANO IT'S EASIER TO LEARN HOW TO WRIE TO BIKE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SO FORTH AS A YOUNG CHILD THAN IT IS A LATER IN LIFE WHAT I MEAN EASIER IN TERMS OF ONE YOU START FROM YYOU START FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING SOMETHING SO THE VERY FIRST TIME IF YOU CAN LEARN CHINESE AS A CHILD VERSES THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU LEARN CHINESES IN ADULOPED OR LEARNING PLAY PIANO AS A CHILD VERSS I ADULOP A BUT THE SPEECH PATHWAYS OR LET'S AY  SPEECH BEHAVIOR I THINK HAS A STRONGER CRITICAL PERIOD A CHANGE TO IT THAN OTHER CIRCUITS A AN WHY WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IN GENERAL  A IF YOU WHY DO YOU NEED A CRITICAL PERIOD TO MAKE YOU MORE STABL A TO MAKE YOU MORE STUBBORN SO TO SPEAK A THE REASON I BELIEVE IS THAT THE BRAIN IS NOT FOR BRAIN CAN ONLY HOLD SO MUCH INFORMATION AND A IF YOU  UNDERGOING RAPID LEARNING TO LEARN TO ACQUIRE NEW KNOWLEDGE YOU ALSO HAVE TO YOU KNOW DUMPSTUP PUT PUT IN MEMORY OR INFORMATION IN THE TRASH LIKE AN A COMPUTER YOUYOU ONLY HAVE SO MANY GIGABASES OF MEMORY AND SO THEREFORE A PLUT PLUS ALSO FOR SURVIVAL YOU DON'T ONE TO KEEP FORGETTING THINGS AND SO SO THE BRAIN IS DESIGND I BELIEVE SO UNDERGO THIS CRITICAL PERIOD AND SOLIDIFY THE CIRCUIDS WITH WHAT YOU LEARN THAT'S A CHILD TAND YOU USE THAT FOR THE REST YOUR LIFE AND WE HUMANS STAY EVEN MORE PLASTIC AN OUR BRAIN FUNCTIONS CONTROL BY A GEING CALLED ESAR GAP TOO WE HAVE AN EXTRA COPY OF IT THAT LEADSE OUR SPEECH CIRCUIT IN OTHER BRAIN REGIONS IN A MORE IMATURE STATE THROUGHOUT LIFE COMPARED TO OTHER ANIMALS SO WE WERE MORE IMMATURE WERE STILL JUVINIL LIKE COMPARED TO OTHER ANIMAL I KNEW IT BUT WE BUT WE STILL GO U TO CRITICAL PERIODS LIKE THE OLL DO AND NOW THE QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT IF YOU LEARN MORE A LANGUAGE IS AS A CHILD CAN IS EASIER TO LEARN AS AN ADULT AND THAT'S A COMMON A FINDING OUT THERE IN LITERATURE THEIR SOM THAT ARGOUE AGAINST IT BUT FOR THOSE THAT SUPPORTED THE IDEA THERE IS AYOU YOU ARE BORN WITH A SET OF MANE SOUNDS YOU CAN PRODUCE E FONANS AND YOU NARROW THAT DOWN AS NOT ALL LANGUAGES USE ALL OF THEM AND SO YOU NARROW DOWN THE ONE YOU USE TO STRING THE PHONUMS TOGETHER IN WORDS THAT YOU LEARN AND YOU MAINTAIN THOSE FUNDANDS AS AN ADULT AND HERE COMES ALONG ANOTHER LANGUAGE THAT'S USING THOSE FUNDANS OR DIFFERENT COMMINATIONS YOU ARE NOT USED TO A IN THEREFORE IS LIKE STARTING FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES BUT IF YOU READY HAVE THEM IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THAT YOURE USING THAN IT MAKES IT EASIER TO USE THEM IN ANOTHER THIRD OF FOURTH LANGUAGE I I SEE INCREDIBLE SO IT SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR BRAIN HAS UNDER HAS MAINTAIN GREATER PLASTICITY IS YOUR MET YOUR BRAIN HAS MAINTAIN GREATER ABILITY TO PRODUCE DIFFERENT SOUNDS THAT THEN ALLOWS YOU TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE FASTER GOT IT ARE THE HAND GESTURES ASSOCIATED WITH SOUNDS OR WITH MEANINGS OF WORDS I THINK THE HAND GESTURES OF ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH THE SOUNDS AND MEANING A WHEN I SAY SOUND LIKE IF YOU ARE REALLY ANGRY RIGHT A AND YOU ARE MAKING A LOUD SCREAMING NOISE RIGHT YOU MAY MAKE HAND GESTURES THAT ARE LOOK LIKE YOTO BEAT THE WALL RIGHT BECAUSE YOUR MAKING LOUD SOUNDS AND LOUD GESTURES RIGHT A BUT IF YOU UNT EXPLAIN SOMETHING I COME OVER HERE WOUT I JUST DO NOW TO YOU FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T SEE ME I SWUNG MY HAND TOWARDS YOU AND SWING AT HERE TO ME THAT HAS A MEANING TO IT TO COME HERE SO JUST LIKE WHAT THE VOICE THE THE HAND GESTURES ARE PRODUCING BOF A  YOU BOT BOTH QUALITIES OF SOUNDSAND FOR PEOPLE THAT SPEAK MULTIPLE LANGUAGES ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT LEARN THOSE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT DO THEY SWITCH THEIR PATTERNS OF MOTOR MOVEMENTS ACCORDING TO LET'S AY I GOING FROM ITALIAN TO ARABIC  OR FROM ARABIC TO FRENCH  IN A WAY THAT MATCHIS THE THE PRECISION OF LANGUAGE THAT THEY'RE SPEAKING YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST ASKD ME A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT WOULD MAKE SENS BECAUSE OF A OF SWITCHING A IN TERMS OF SOMETIMES PEOPLE MIG CALL THIS COAT SWITCHING EVEN DIFFERENT VIOLECTS OF THE SAME LANGUAGE COULD YOU DO THAT WITH YOUR GESTURES I IMAGINE SO BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF THAT TURENON I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIECE BECAUSE I ONLY SPEAK ONE LANGUAGE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GRAINS ATHLETIC GRAINS NOW CALLED AG ONE IS A VITEMENT MIN ORAL PROBIATIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATION AL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS 'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSERING THE PODCAST THERE ISN MY STORY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME I THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH AR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ICS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MEAN SYSTEM AND BASICALY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIATICS ENATHLTIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ITHLETIC RENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGENS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTESCRIPE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLTIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO AGAIND THAT'S ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUMERMEN TO GET THE FIE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY A VITEMEND THREE K TO TO GO A LITTLE INTO THE ABSTRACT BUT NOT TWO MAR ONE ABOUT MODES OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THAT SEEM TO HAVE A DEPTH OF EMOTIONALITY AND MEANING BUT FOR WHICH IT DEPARTS FROM STRUCTURED LANGUAGE HERE'S WHAT I MEAN A POETRY AI THINK OF MUSICIANS LIKE THE'RE SOMEBOBDILLAN SONGS THAT TO ME I UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS I LIKE TO THINK THERE'S AN EMOTION ASSOCIATED WITH AT LEAST I EXPERIENCE SOME SORT OF EMOTION AND I HAVE A GUESS ABOUT WHAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING BUT IF I WERE TO JUST READ IT LINEARILY WITHOUT THE MUSIC AND WITHOUT HIM SINGING IT OR SOMEBODY SINGIG LIKE HIM IT WOULDN'T HOLD ANY MEANING SO IN OTHER WORDS THA WORDS THAT SEEM TO HAVE MEANING BUT NOT ASSOCIATED WITH LANGUAGE BUT SOMEHOW TAPPEN TO AN EMOTIONALITY YET ABSOLUTELY SO SO WE CALL THIS DIFFERENCE O SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION WITH MEANING AN EFFECT IF COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION THAT HAS MORE F AN EMOTIONAL FEELING CONSENTO YOUAVE BEENOT WITH OUN OF THE CEMANTICS AND THE TWO CAN BE MIXED UP LIKE WOULD SINGING WORDS THAT HAVE MEANING BUT ALSO HAVE THIS EFFECT OF EMOTIONAL YOU JUST LOVE THE SOUND OF THE SINGER THAT YOURE HEARING AND A INITIALLY IM AYOUPSYCHOLOGIST SCIENCIS IN GENERAL THOUGHT THAT THESE WERE GOING TO BE CONTROLLED BY DIFFERENT BRAIN CIRCUITS I AND IT IS THE CASE THERE ARE MOTIONAL BRAIN CENTERS IN THE HYPOTHALEMIS IN THE SINGULAR QUARTZEXS AND SO FORTH THAT DO GIVE TONGUE TO THE SOUNDS BUT I I BELIEVE YOU KNOW BASE UPON IMAGING WORK AND WORK WE SEE IN BIRDS WHEN WHEN BIRDS ARE COMMUNICATING SEMANTIC INFORMATION IN THEIR SOUNDS WHICH AS NOT TOO OFTEN BUT IT HAPPENS VERSES A EFFECT OF COMMUNICATION SING BE CAUSE I'M TRYING TO ATTRACT THE MATE MY COURTSHIP SONG OR DEFEND MY TERRITORY IT'S THE SAME BRAIN CIRCUITS THE E SAME SPEECH LIKE OR SONG CIRCUITS ARE BEING USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS A A FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S ALSO A SERAPIST A SAID TO ME YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE TO SAY I LOVE YOU WITH INTENSE HATRED AND TO SAY I HATE YOU WITH INTENSE LOVE I AND OF REMINDING ME THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO HEAR BOTH OF THOSE STATEMENTS IN EITHER WAY SO A I GUESS IT'S NOT JUST LIMITED TO SONG OR POETRY IT ALSO A THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE INTENTION AND THE EMOTIONAL CONTEXT WHICH SOMETHING SPOKEN THAT IT CAN HEAVILY SHAPE THE WAY THAT A WE INTERPRET WHAT WE HEAR THAT'S RIGHT AND AND AND I CONSIDER ALL OF THAT ACTUONAL MEANING EVEN THOGH I DEFIND IT IS AF PEOPLE COMMONLY DO SEMANTIC AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION TO SAY I HATE YOU BUT MEN LOVE RIGHT IS ON DOES HAVE A MOTIONAL MEANING TO IT A AND SO YOU ONCE MORE LIKE AN OBJECT KIND OF ME YOURE AN ABSTRACT IN MEANING THER'S SEVILAR OF THE POINTS HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR FOR THE THOSE LISTENING OUT THERE TIO HEAR IS THAT WHEN I SAY ALSO THIS EFFECTIVE AND A SEMANTIV COMMUNICATION A BEING USED BY SIMILAR BRAIN CIRCUITS IT ALSO MATTERS A SIDE OF THE BRAIN  IN BIRDS AND INHUMANS A THERE'S THERE'S LEFT RIGHT DOMINANTS A FOR LEARNED A COMMUNICATION LEARNED SOUND COMMUNICATION A SO THE LEFT IN USHUMANS IS MORE DOMINANT FOR SPEECH BUT THE RIGHT HAS A MORE BALANCE FOR SINGING OR PROCESSING MUSICAL SOUNDS AS SUPPOSE A PROCESSING SPEECH BOTH GET USED FOR BOTH REASONS AND SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY YOUR RIGHT BRIN IS YOUR ARTISTIC BRAIN AN YOUR LEFT RAIN IS YOUR THINKING BRAIN THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE REFERRING TO A AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER DISTINCTION A SECOND A THING THAT'S USEFUL TO KNOW IS THAT ALL VOCAL LEARNING SPECIES USED THEIR LEARNED SOUNDS FOR THIS EMOTIONAL EFFECTIVE KIND OF COMMUNICATION BUT ONLY A FEW OF THEM LIKE HUMANS AND SOME PARIS AND DOLPINS USE IT FOR THI SEMANTIC KIND OF COMMUNICATION ME CALLING SPEECH AND AND THAT HAS LED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE EVOLUTION OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE OF SPEECH EVOVE FIRST FOR SINGING A FOR THIS MORE LIKE EMOTIONAL KIND OF MADE ATTRACTION LIKE THE GENERFOR LOPES HE RICKY MARTIN KIND OF SONGS AND SO FORTH A AND THEN LATER ON IT BECAME USED FOR ABSTRACT COMMUNICATION LIKE WE'RE DOING NOW O INTERESTING WELL THAT'S A PERFECT SAGUAT FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND A AND MOTOR CONTROL NOT ONLY OF THE HANDS BUT OF THE BODY SO YOU HAVE A A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS TO YOUR NAME BUT ONE OF THEM A IS THAT YOU WERE A MEMBER OF THE ALVENAILY DANSE A SCHOOL SCHOOL OF THATS WI AS W OMSERE YOU'RE AN ACCOMPLISHED OR AND QUITE ABLE DANCER RIGHT IM TELL US ELO BIT ABOUT YOUR ON BACKGROUND IN THE THE WORLD OF DANCE AND AS HOW ITD INFORMS YOUR INTERESTIN NERO SCIENCE EXCUSE ME AND PERHAPS EVEN HOW IT THE LATE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR WORK ON SPEECH AND LANGUAGE YES WEL IT'S IT'S INTERESTING IN THAT THIS KIND OF HISTORY EVEN GOES BEFORE MY TIME SO IN MY FAMILY MY MOTHER AND FATHER SIDE THEY BOTH WENT TO TH HIGH SCHOOL O MUSIC AN ART HERE IN NEW YORK CITY A AND PARTICULAR MY MOTHER'S FAMILY GOING BACK MULTIPLE GENERATIONS THERE WERE SINGERS AND I EVEN DID MY FAMILY GENIALOGY AND FOUND OUT NOT ONLY IN A WE HAVE SOME RELATIONSHIP TO SOME WHILE KNOWN SINGERS DISINT RELATIONSHIPS LIKE FELONIOUS MUNG BUT GOING BACK TO THE PLANTATIONS AN  THE NORTH CAROLINA AND SO FORTH MY ANCESTORS WERE SINGERS IN THE CHURCH FOR THE YOU KNOW THE TOWNS AND SO FORTH AND THIS SOMEHOW GOT PASSED ON MULTIPLE GENERATIONS TO MY FAMILY I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GOW UP AND BE A FAMOUS SINGER RIGHT AND MY EVEN ME AN MY BROTHERS AND SISTER FORMED A BAND ONE OF HER KIDS AND AND SO FORTH AND BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I DIDN'T INHERIT THE SINGING TALENTS OF SOME MY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS EVEN THOUG YES YO KAY YOU KNOW BUT NOT LIKE MY BROTHER OR NOT LIKE MY MOTHER MY AUNTS AND MY COUSIN PUT IFAY WHOSE NOW THE TALENT AND NATIVE AMERICAN SINGER AND SO A SO A WHAT THAT THEN INFLUENCED ME TO DO OTHER THINGS AND I STARTED A YOU KNOW COMPETING IN DANCE CONTESTS  YOU KNOW ACTIANY IS NO RAND THE TIME ON SAT IN MY FEVER AND I WAS AS A TEA MATUR D I STARTED WHEN WINNING DANCE CONTESTS D I THOUGHT OH I CAN DANCE AND I ODITION FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL PERFORMING ARTS AND I GOT IN HERE IN NEW YORK CITY  AND GOT INTO A BALET DANCE AND GOT IN RIGHT AND AND THOUGHT IF I LEARNED VALLET I CAN LEARN EVERYTHING ELSE IT WAS THAT IND IF HO LEARND SOMETHING CLASSICAL YOU CAN TEACH YOU FOR EVERYTHING ELSE A AND I WAS YET AT ALVONAILY DANCE SCHOOL JOFFREY VALLET DANCE SCHOOL AND AT THE END OF MY SENIOR AS A CONCERT A I WAS HAD THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ADDITION FOR THEAVONALI DANCE COMPANY AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I ALSO FELL IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER PASSION THAT MY FATHER HAD WHICH WAS SCIENCE AND SO I LIKED SCIENCE AND HIGH SCHOOL AND I FOUND AN OVERLAP ALSO BETWEEN THE ARTS AND SCIENCES YOU KNOW BOTH REQUIRED CRACTIVITY HARD WORK DISCIPLIN YOU KNOW NEW DISCOVERY BOTH FORNT BORING TO ME AND THE ONE DECISION I MADE AT THAT AT THAT SENIOR DANCE CONTERT WAS YOU KNOW TALKING TO THAVONALI RECRUITER AND THINKING ABOUT IT I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AND I THOUGHT SOMETHING MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME CAUSE SHE WAS GROWN UP IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION DO SOMETHING THAT HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON SOCIETY AND I THOUGHT I CAN DO THAT BETTER AS A DANCER THAN A SCIENTIS SO NOW JUMP I GET INTO COLLEGE UNDERGRADUL SCHOOL I MAJOR AND MOLECULABIOLOGY AND MATHEMATICS I DECIDE I WANT TO BE A BIOLOGIST GOT IN TO GRADUAL SCHOOL WENTED TO SUDY THE THE BRAIN AT YOU OGHT TE ROCEFOL UNIVERSITYES SO I WONT FROM HUNTECOLLEGE OF ARCIFILLG UNIVERSITY AND SO NOW I GOT TO THE BRAIN AND IS AND WHY DID I CHOOSE THE BRAIN IS BECAUSE IT CONTROLS DANCING BUT I DI THERE WAS ANYBODY'S STUDYING DANCING NI WANTN'T STUDY THE BRAIN SOMETHING THAT IT DOES THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IN CONPLEX AND I THOUGHT A LANGUAGES WHAT IT DOES YOU COULDN'T STUDY THAT IN MIC YOU COULDN'T SUDYING NON HUMAN PRIMADES BUT THESE BIRDS DO THIS WONDERFUL THING THAT FOR NAN A NADOBON WAS SUDING AT RARCEFILLER AND SO THAT'S WHAT GOT ME INTO THE BIRDS AAND ZAM AND THEND JUMPING NOW FIFTEEN YEARS LATER YOU KNOMYET THAT'S RIGHT EVEN AFTER I'M INTO NOW HAVING MY OWN LADS STUDYING VOCAL LEARNING IN THESE BIRDS AS A MODEL FOR LANGUAGE IN HUMANS IT TURNS OUT THAT A A NO UNYPATEL AND A UN OTHERS A HAVE DISCOVERED A THAT A ONLY VOCAL LEARNING SPECIES CAN LEARN HOW TO DANCE I'S ALL RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT YES TH I SHALL IAVE SEEN THESE IM JUST SCROLLING THROUGH THE THE FILES HERE IN MYT IN MY MIND I THINK ABOUT EVERO S WILE SOMEONE WAS I LOVE A PAROT YET IM EVERO SWILE SOME ONE WILL SEND MEATE ONE OF THESE OLD IN SIR GAMMER TWINTER VIDIOS OF A PAROT DOING WHAT LOOKS TO ME LIKE DANCE TIBICALLY TO COCATO THAT'S RIGHT RIGHT THAT'S WHAT  EVEN FOOTSTOP PAYING TO THE OTHER SOUND AND FAMOUS ONE CALLS SNOWBALL OUT THERE BUT THER'RE NON THEY'RE MANY SNOWBALLS OUT  THERTHEY'RE ALL ALL THE DANCING BIRDS ARE NAME SNOWBLL I NO IN OIN DACTIC AH SO ONLY ANIMALS WITH LANGUAGE DANCE YET VOCAL LEARNING IN PARTICULAR THE BILITY TO IMITATE SOUNDS YES INCREDIBLE YES AND THIS NOW AS BRINGING MY LIFEFULL CIRCLE RIGHT AND I AND AND SO WHEN THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE A AT THAT SAME TIME IN MY LAB AT DUKE WE DISCOVERED THAT VOCAL LEARNING BRAIN PATHWAYS IN SOM BIRDS AS WELL AS IN HUMANS AND IN PAROTS I LIKE SNOWBALL A ARE IMBEDDED WITH IN CIRCUIT SHE CONTROL LEARNING HOW TO MOVE AND THAT LED US TO A THEORY O CALL THE BRAIN PAT'HWAY OR MOTOR THEORY OF VOCAL LEARNING ORIGIN WHE'RE THE BRAIN PATHWAYS FOR VOCAL LEARNING IN SPEECH EVOLVE BY A WHOLE DIPLICATION OF THE SURROUNDING MOTOR CIRCUITS INVOLVING LEARNING HOW TO MOVE NOW HOW DIS THAT EXPLAIN DANCE RIGHT WELL WHEN WHEN SNOWBALL THE COCATUNES ORE DANCING THEY'RE USING THE BRAIN REGIONS AROUND THEIR SPEECH LIKE CIRCUITS TO TO DO THIS DANCING BEHAVIOR AND SO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE WHAT WE WHAT WE HYPOTHESIZE AND NOW LIKE TE TEST IS THAT WHEN THIS WHEN WHEN SPEECH EVALL IN HUMANS AND THE EQUIVALENT BEHAVIOUR IN PAROTS AND SOMBERDS IT REQUIRE A VERY TIGHT INTEGRATION IN THE BRAIN REGIONS THAT CAN HEAR A SOUND WITH THE BRAIN REGIONS THAT CONTROL YOUR MUSCLES FROM MOVING YOUR LARINGS AND TONG AND SO FORTH FOR PRODUCING SOUND AND THAT SIGHT UDITORY MOTOR INTEGRATION WE ARGUE THAN CONTAMINAE THE SURROUNDING BRAIN REGIONS AND THAT CONTAMINATION OF THE SURROUNDING BRAINREINCE NOW ALOWS US HUMANS AF PARTICULAR IN PARITS TO ORDINATE OUR MUSCLE MOVEMENTS OF THE REST OF THE BODY WITH SOUND IN THE SAME WAY WE DO FOR SPEECH SOUNDS SO WE SPEAKING WITH OUR BODIES WHEN WE DANCE INCREDIBLE AND AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT AS POOR AS I AM AT SPEAKING MULTIBLE LANGUAGES I'M EVEN WORSE AT DANCING SO A BY I GUARANTEY YOURE BETTER THAN THE A MONKEY BUT NOT SNOBOLACOCA  MAY NOT  ON YOUTO WE HAVE A VITYOVER THERE SOME SCIENCE IS DANCEING WITH SNOWBALL AND YOU'LL SEE SNOWBALLS DOING BETTER THAN SOME OF THE SCIENTISTS ET WAS ALSO I'M NOT THE WORST OF ALL SCIENCE AND I DANCIN A IS ALWAYS IN ERAL PLASTICITY  MAY IT SAVE ME SOME DAY YOU SAID SOMETHING INCREDIBLE THAT I'VE I I COMPLETELY BELIEVE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A MINIMUM TO LECHUS A MINIMUM DANCING ABILITY I CAN GET BY AT A PARTO YOUR WENDING WITHOUT COMPLETE EMBARRASSMENT BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY STRUCTURE TRAINING  IS SO THE BODY CLEARLY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH MOVEMENT AS A TRAIN DANCER AND KNOWING OTHER TRAIN DANCERS I ALWAYS THINK OF DANCE AND BODILY MOVEMENT IND COMMUNICATION THROUGH BODILY MOEMENT AS A FORM OF A WORD LISTNESS LIKE A STANCT OF WORDLESSNESS IN FACT THAT THE FEW TIMES WEN I THINK THAT MAYBE I MASHY DANCING MODESTLY WELL FOR THE CONTEXT THAT I'M IN WERE I SEE OTHER PEOPLE DANCING THEY SEEM TO JUST BE VERY MUCH IN THE MOVEMENT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A STATE OF NON LANGUAGE A NON SPOKEN LANGUAGE M AND AND YET WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THAT THERE'S A A DIRECT BRIDGE AT SOME LEVEL BETWEEN THE THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND AND LANGUAGE SO IS THERE A LANGUAGE OF THE BODY THAT IS DISTINCT FROM THE LANGUAGE OF SPEECH AND IF SO OR IF NOT HOW DO THOSE MAP ON TO ONE ANOTHER WAS THAT VEN DIAGRAM LOOK LIKE YE YE SO SO SO LET ME DEFIND FIRST DANCE IN THIS CONTEXT OF VOCAL LEARNING SPECIES THIS IS THE KIND OF DANCING THAT WE ARE SPECIALIZED IN DOING AND OTHER INTHE BOK LEARNING SPECIES OF SPECIALIZE IN DOING IS SYNCUINIZING BODY MOVEMENTS OF MUSCLES TO THE RHYTHMIC BEAT OF MUSIC AND FOR SOME REASON WE LIKE DOING THAT WE LIKE SYNCRINIZING TO SOUNDS AND DOING IT TOGETHER AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THAT KIND OF COMMUNICATION AMONGS OURSELVES IS MORE LIKE THE EFFECTI OF KIND OF COMMUNICATION I MENTIONED EARLIER UNLIKE THE SEMANTIC KIND SO WE HUMANS ARE USING OUR VOICE IS MORE FOR THI SEMANTIC ABSTRACT COMMUNICATION BY REUSING LEARNED DANCE FOR THE EFFECTIVE EMOTIONAL BONDING KIND OF COMMUNICATION IT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE SEMANTIC INFORMATION IN DANCE AND WE DO IT  BUT IT'S NOT AS POPULAR YOU KNOW LIKE A BALLAT THAT YOU KNOW IN THE NUTCRACKER IT IS POPULAR NOW WHERE THEY ARE COMMUNICATING YOU KNOW O THE ARAVIAN GY COMES OUT WHICH I WAS THE RAVIAN GUYING ABLLIG NOT CRACKAN AS I AM O YOUHAVE FOR THE WESCHESTER BALLET COMPANY WHEN I WAS A TEAN AGOR A YOU KNOW ERTRYING TO COMMUNICATE MEETING IN OUR BALLEY DANCEING IT CAN GO ON WITH A WHOLE STORY AND SO FORTH AND BUT PEOPLE DON'T INTERPRET THAT IS CLEARLY A SPEECH YOU KNOW THERE SEEING THE BALLET WITH SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION WITH A LOT OF EMOTIONAL CONTENT WHERE'S YOU GO OUT TO A CLUB YOU KNOW YET YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT COMING COMMUNICATING UKE A HOW YOU FEELING TO DAY TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAY AND SO FORTH YOU'RE TRYING TO SYNCRINIZE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THE THE DANCE BRAIN CIRCUIT INHERITED THE MORE ANCIENT PART OF THE SPEECH CIRCUIT WHICH WAS FOR SINGING I WAS HAD THE FEELING THAT WITH CERTAIN FORMS OF MUSIC A E PARTICULAR OPERA BUT ANY KIND OF A MUSIC WHERE THERE'S SOME LONG NOTES A SOME THAT AT SOME LEVEL THERE WAS A A LITERAL RESONENCE CREATED BETWEEN THE SINGER AND THE LISTENER THAT OM ER I THINK IT LIKE THE DEEP VOICE OF A ABAJOHNNY CASH OR WHERE AT SOME LEVEL YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL THE VOICE IN YOUR OWN BODY AND IN FEORY THAT COULD BE THE THE VIBRATION OF THE THE OR THE FIRING OF THE FRANTIC NER OF CONTROLLING THE DIAFRAME FOR ALL I KNOW IS THER ANY EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S A CORDINATION BETWEEN PERFORMER AN AUDIENCE AT THE AT THE LEVEL OF MIND AND BODY IM I'M GIN TO SAY POSSIBLY YES AND THE REASON WHYS MEANS I JUST CAME BACK FROM A CONFERENCE ON THE NUROBILEGY OF DANCE A ON THE CLEARLY I'M GOING TO THE WRON A A COLLE YO ISIN SIDE MIGT E SO WORRING YES ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES TO COMPS O FITCH AND THE JONATHAN FORTS THEY WERE ORGANIZE A PARTICULAR SECTION ON ON THIS CONFERENCE IN VIRGINIA AND THIS IS A FIRST TIME I WAS IN THE ROOM  TH SOMANY NERO SCIENTIS STUDYING THE NROBILGIF DANCE IT'S A NEW FIELD NOW IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND A THERE WAS ONE AA A LAB WHERE THEY WERE PUTTING E G ELECTROS ON A THE DANCERS ON TWO DIFFERENT DANCERS PARTNING WITH EACH OTHER AS WELL AS A THE AUDIENCE YOU KNOW A SEEING THE DANCE AND AND SOME YOU KNOW ARE YOU NOK ATE YOURE LISTENING TO THE MUSIC AS WELL HOW YOU RESPONDING BAS YO'RE YOU'RE ASKMG A QUESTION ABOUT MUSIC AND O'M GIVING YO AN ANSWER ABOUT DANCE AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT YOU KNOW A THE DANCERS WHEN THEY RESINATED WITH EACH OTHER DURING THE DANCE ARE THE AUDIENCE LISTENING TO THE DANCERS AND THE MUSIC THERE'S SOME RESIDENCE GOING ON THERE THAT THEY SCORES HIGHER RESIDENCE THE BRAIN ACTIVITY WITH THESE WIRELESS E G SIGNALS ARE SHOWING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SO THAT'S WHY THEY POSSIBLY AT IT IT NEEDS IT NEEDS MORE VIGOROUS STUDY AND OU KNOW THIS IS SOME SUFP THEY PUBLISH BUT IT'S NOT PRYING TIME YET BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THE SOUT OF IT SO AT LEAST AM IF I CAN'T DANCE WELL MAYBE I CAN HEAR AND FEEL WHAT IT IS TO DANCE IN A CERTAIN WAY THAT THAT'S RIGHT AND AND AND THIS WILL BE SOME PEOPLE WOT THINK THAT THEY EVEN SONGS THAT THEY HEAR AND THEY CAN C ALMOST SING TO THEMSELVES IN THEIR OWN HEAD AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANTED TO SOUND LIKE YU KNOW ONE REALLY SOUNDS GOOD WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE BUT THEY CAN'T GET THEIR VOICE TO DO IT I RAISIT F THOSE LISTENING ONRAISING MY HAND I KNOW NO MUSICAL ABILITY OTHERS IN MY HOUSEHOLD HAVE TREMENDOUS MUSICAL ABILITY WITH INSTRUMENTS AND WITH VOICE BUT  NOT ME OF WHAT AND AND SO THIS IS ONE IN MY ONE OF MY A SELFISH GOALS OF TRYNG TO FING THE GENETICS AWHISE CAN SOME PEOPLE SING REALLY WELL AND SOME NOT IS THERE'S SOME GENETIC PRETISPHYSICIAN TO THAT AND THEN CAN I MODIFY MY OWN MUSCLES OF RAIN CIRCUITS TO SING BETTER HE'RE STILL AFTER OTHERTHE SING IS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SIMBLINGS ARE A VARY AN INPROFICIENCY IS THAT THEYA COMPETIVENESS AMONG A BROTHERS AND SISTERS NEVER GOES AWAY I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BRE AS GOOD AS MY BROTHER MARK AND VICTOR ENOUGH FOR A THE RETH OF THE HOPE MY ENTIRE LIFE I WATCH OUT MY AN NI TRS COMING FOR YOU WITH NOSIDEE I O TAK AND EARLIER YOU SAID THAT YOU DISCOVERED THAT YOU COULD DANCE THAT THAT CAUGHT MY EAR AM IT SELLS LIKE YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO I'V NOT SUGGESTING YOU DIDN'T WORK HARD AT IT YAT AT THE MOMENT WHERE YU DISCOVERED IT A ITS JUST SORT OF WAS A A SKILL THAT YOU HAD THAT UP UNTIL THAT POINT YOU DIDN'T TORGET A A LIFE IN IN THE WORLD OF DANCE BUT THE FACT THAT YOU QOTINCLE DISCOVERED THAT YOU COULD DANCE RELY ELLA AN WENT TO THIS INCREDIBLE SCHOOL OF DANCAN AND DID WELL A TELLS ME THAT PERHAPS THERE IS A A ABILITY THAT WAS BUILT UP IN CHILDHOOD ANDERE THAT PERHAPS WE DO ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT GENETIC LEANINGS FOR FOR DIFFERENT A MOTOR FUNCTIONE YE WEL THE FOR ME THERE COULD BE BOTH EXPLANATIONS COULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST OM YET I GREW UP IN ITS FAMILY LISTENING TO MO TOWN SONGS NO DANCING YOU KNOW ATS A PARTIES AND SO FOR FAMILY PARTIES AND  AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY BASICALLY AND ZA U SO SO I GREW UP DANCING A FROM A YOUNG CHILD BUT THIS THIS THI SCOVERY YOU KNOW MAY BE DANCING EVEN MORE SO A AIN TERMS OF OF A TALENT IT COULD THE GENETIC COMPONENT IF IT REALLY EXISTS I DON'T KNOW YU KNOW IT MY TWENTY THREE IN ME A RESULTS YOU KNOWIT SAYS I HAVE A THE GENETIC A SUBSTITUTIONS THAT ASSOCIATED WITH THA YOU KNOW HIGH INTENSITY ASK LEADS AND FAST TWIST MUSCLES AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE THAT COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH ME BEING ABLE TO SINCRANIZE AOF MY BODY A A TO RHYTHMIC TOWNS MAYBE MAYBE BETTER THAN SOME OTHERS A IT TURNS OUT THAT MY GENETICS ALSO SHOW THAT I HAVE A GENETIC SUBSTITUTE THAT DOES IT THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR ME TO SING ON PITCH AND SO THAT THAT'S CORRELATE WITH MY YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I CAN SING ONSPITCHVESSILY IF I HEAR A PIANO A OR YOU NO CONPLAYING IT BUT THA YOUW MAYBE THAT'S WHY MY SIMILINGS YOU WHO DIDN'T HAVE THAT GENETIC PREDISPOSITION IN HIS TWENTY THREE WE RESULTS YOU KNOW UT CAN GO ALONG WITH THE GENETIC A COMPONDED AS WELL OF IMAGINING FAMILY GATHERINGS ITH TWENTY THREE AND  DAYA AN AN INTENSE ARGUMENTS ABOUT IT YA AN A AN LEAR ABILITY YES ON A LOVE TO THE AAN ATTENDAN I'M NOT INVITING MYSELF TO YOUR THANGS GETTING ING  O I I SUPPOSE I AM YOU'RE WELCOME TO THANK YU A I'LL BRING MY TWENTY THREE AND ME DIT A AT LOVE TO CHAT A MOMENT ABOUT FACIAL EXPRESSION AS THAT'S A FORM OF MOTOR PATTERN THAT YOU N I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE A JUST THINK ABOUT SMILING AND FROWNING BUT THERE OF COURSE OU A THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF MICRO EXPRESSIONS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBCONSCIOUS A AND WE'RE WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN WHAT SOMEBODY SAYS DOESN'T MATCH SOME SPECIFIC FEATURE OF THER FACIAL EXPRESSION THAT IT CAN A CALL UP YOU KOW THAT MIS MATCH CAN CU OUR ATTENTION ESPECIALLY AMONG PEOPLE THAT KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL YE LIKE YOU S SOMEBODY WIL SAID WHEN YOU SAID THAT BUT YOU YOUR RIGHT EYED TWHICH TO THE YOU KNOW A LITTLE IT IN A WAY THAT TELLS ME THAT YOU GENEREALLY MEAN THAT THIS THESE KINDS OF THINGS OR WHEN A N OPPOSITE EXAMPLE WHEND THE MOTIONALITY AND THE CONTENT OF OUR SPEECH IS MATCH TO A FACIAL EXPRESSION THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST SO AM AT WONDERFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING'S A LIND YET SO HOW DOES YE MOTOR CIRCUITRY THAT CONTROLS FACIAL EXPRESSION MAP ON TO THE THE BRIN CIRCUITS THE CONTROL LANGUAGE SPEECH AND EVEN BODILY IN HAND MOVE YES UT YOU YIT YOU ASK A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE WE BOTH NOW SOME COLLEGUES LIKE MINRIC RIVAL THAT THE ROCKOPEL UNIVERSITY WHO STUDY FACIAL EXPRESSION IN THE NEUROBOGY BEHIND IT AND KNOW WE BOV SHARE SOME STUDENTS THAT WERE COMENTORING AND TALK ABOUT THE SAME QUESTION THAT YOU BROUGHT UP AND WHUT I'M LEARNING A LOT IS THAT NON HUMAN PRIMATES HAVE A LOT OF DIVERSITY IN THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSION LIKE WE HUMANS DO AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE NE R BIOLOGY OF BRAIN REGIONS CONTROLLING THOSE MUSCLES OF THE FACE IS THAT THESE NONHUMAN PRIMATES AND SOME OTHER SPECIES THAT DON'T LEARN HOW TO IMITATE VLZATIONS THEY HAVE STRONG CONNECTIONS FROM THE CORTICAL REGIONS TO THE LUTOR NERONS THAT CONTROL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS BUT ABSENT CONNECTIONS OR WE CONNECTIONS TO THE MOTORNERNS HAT CONTROL THE VOICE SO I THINK OUR DIVERSE FACIAL EXPRESSION EVEN THOUGH IT'S MORE DIVERSINTIES NON UMAN PRIMATES THERES ARE READY FRE EXISTING DIVERSITY OF COMMUNICATION WHETHER IT'S INTENTIONAL OR UNCONSCIOUS THROUGH FACIAL EXPRESSION IN OUR ANCESTORS AND ON TOP OF THAT WE HUMANS NOW AND THE VOICE ALONG WITH THOSE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS I SEE THE AND IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE LEARNING WHEN WE'R KIDS OF IT OUT CHILDREN FORTUNATELY ARE NOT TOLD TO FAKE THEIR EXPRESSIONS OR TO SMILE WHEN THEY SAY I'M HAPPY O SUCH SOME POINT EVERYBODY LEARNS FOR BETTER FOR WORSE HOW TO UNTANGLE THESE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF HAND MOVEMENT BOTHEBODY POSTURE SPEECH AND FACIAL EXPRESSION YES BUT IN IT IN THEIR BEST FORM I WOULD SAY A ASSUMING THAT THE BEST FORM IS ALWAYS I GUESS THER ARE INSTIONCS IS WEARE IN OL FOR SAFETY REASONS ONE MIGHT NEED TO FEIN SOME OF THESE A  SOME OF THESE ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE BUT IN MOST CASES WHEN THOSE ARE ALINED A IT SEEMS LIKE THAT COULD REFLECT THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT CIRCUITRIES ARE OPERATING IN PARALLEL BUT THAT H THE ABILITY TO MISSILINEESE IS ALSO A A POWERFUL ASPECT TO OUR MATURATION I I THEN THINK OF THEEDR FOR INSTANCE WHERE DELIBERATE DISENTANGLING OF OF THESE AREAS IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO WE KNOW WHEN AN ACTOR WHEN IT FEELS REAL YOM AND WHEN IT LOOKS LAT WHEN BAD ACTING IS OFTENTIMES WHEN THE FACIAL EXPRESSION OR BODY POSSERGEST DOESN'T QUITE MATCH WHET WERE HEARING AT SO ARE THESE SKILLS THAT THAT PEOPLE THAT LEARN AND ACQUIRE ACCORDING TO ADAPTABILITY IN PROFESSION OR DO YOU THINK THAT ALL CHILDREN AND ALL ADULTS EVENTIALLY LEARN HOW TO COUPLE AND UNCOUPLE THESE CIRCUITS A LITTLE BIT YET I I THINK IT'S IT'S THE THE SIMILAR ARGUMENT IN MENTIO EARLIER ABOUT THE INATE AND THE LEARN FOR THE VOCLIZATIONS AND BY THE WAY WHEN I SAY WE HUMANS HAVE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ASSOCIATED WITHOUT VOCLIZATIONS IN HE DIFFERENT WAY THAN PRIMATES NONHUMEN PRIMATES IT'S THE LEARN VOCLIZATIONS ON TALKING ABOUT SO THERE IS A COMMON VIEW OUT THERE THAT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND NONHUMAN SPECIES LIKE ON HUMAN PRIMATES OR YOU CAN HAVE THEM IN BIRDS TO ARE ON INNATE I AND SO THERE THERE THEIR REFLECTS IN CONTROL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I THINK THERE'S SOME LEARNED COMPONENTO IT AND I THINK WE HAVE MORE LEARNING COMPONENTO IT AS WELL BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN ANNATE COMPONENT AND SO IF YOU TRY TO PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK AND AN HOLD YOUR FITS OR EVEN DOEST NOT AND TRY TO PE AND TRY TO COMMUNICATE IT'S ACTLLY HARDER TO DO YOU HAVE TO FORCE ITSELF OR PUT IT BY BY YOUR SIDE THIS COMES NATURALLY FAEAL EXPRESSIONS COMES NATURALLY BE THERE IS AN INNATE COMPONIENT AND YES YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DISSOCIATE THE TOO COMMUNICATE SOMETHING ANGRY WITH YOUR HANDS OVTH YOUR FACE BUT I'M YOU KNOW I POLITELY WITH YOUR VOICE IT'S VERY HARD TO T THAT TO SEPARATE AT THIS TO BECAUSE THERE IS THAT INNATE COMPONENT THAT BRINGS THEM TOGETHER I SO IT'S LIKE AN EMALE TO YOUR YOUR EMALING AND SO ONE SAYS SOMETHING BY EMALES SOING CAN INTERPRET THAT ANGRILY OR OR GENTLY I AND I IT BEBECOMES AMBIGUOUS THE FACEFUL EXPRESSIONS GET RID OF THAT AMBIGUITY I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT OUT BECAUSE MY NEXT QUESTION WAS AND IS ABOUT WRITTEN LANGUAGE A THE FIRST QUESTION I'LL ASK IS WHEN YOU WRITE EITHER TYPE OR WRITE THINGS OUT BY HAND DO YOU HEAR THE CONTENT OF WHAT YOU WANT TO WRITE IN YOUR HAD YOU JUST YOU PERSONALLY YES I DO I I I AND I KNOW THAT I DO BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A DEBAT ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND TRYG TO RESOLVE TE BATE WITH MY OWN SE EXPERIMENTATION ON ME I ASAT BECAUSE A A QUITE WELL KNOWN COLLYGUE OF OURS CARL DYSIRA AT STAMFORD WHO'S BEEN ON THIS PODCAST ANNS YOU OPTOGANEC FAME AND SYCHIETARY FAME ET CETERA AND I I KNOW HIM YEOM HE SENDS HIS REARKS I I TOLD ME THAT A HIS PRACTISE FOR WRITING AND FOR THINKING INVOLVES A QUITE PAINFUL A PROCESS OF FORCING HIMSELF TO SIT COMPLETELY STILL AND THINK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES TO FORCE THINKING AND COMPLETE SENTENCE IS IT WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT I DECIDE TO TRY THIS EXERCISE AND IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT FIRST ALL IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE REASON THAT YOU MENTION WHIGE IS THAT WITH MANY THOUGHTS I WANT TO LOOK AROUND AND I START TO GESTICULATE WITH MY HANDS AT'S THERE IT IS AGAIN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND HAND MOVEMENT EVEN IF ONE ISN'T SPEAKING THA AND THE OTHER PART IS THAT I THAT'S CHALLENGING IS I REALIZE THAT WHILE WE WRITE IN COMPLETE SENTENCES MOST OF THE TIME WILL TALK ABOUT HOW THAT'S CHANGING NOW AND TEXTING ET CETERA THAT WE DON'T OFTEN THINK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES AND SPECIFICALLY IN SIMPLE DECLARATIVE SENTENCES THAT A LOT OF OUR THOUGHTS WOULD BE IF WERE IF THEY WERE WRITTEN OUT ON TO A PAGE WOULD LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE PASSIVE LANGUAGE THAT A GOOD COPY EDITOR OR A GOOD EDITOR WOULD SAY HLIKE WE EANT TO CROSS TIS OUT MAKE THE SIMPLE AND DECLARATIVE SO WHAT I'M GETTING AT HERE IS WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF GOING FROM A THOUGHT TO LANGUAGE TO WRITTEN WORD AND I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH ON HANDWRITTEN VERSIS TYPED BUT THOUGHT TO LANGUAGE TO WRITTEN WORD WHAT'S GOING ON THERE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE NARRL CIRCUITRY AND I AS COULD ASK WHISE IT SO HARD BUT NOW I WANT TO ASK WHY IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE IT'S SE UCK OF VERY CHALLENGING NAURL COMPUTATION OL PROBLEM YA YE AND AND FROM COMING FROM THE LINGUISTIC WORLD O IDN'T EVEN JUST THE RAG WEN YEUR WILGE WORLD GOING BACK TO SOMING A SAID BEFORE S ABOUT A SEPARATE LANGUAGE MODULE IN THE BRAIN NON THERE IS IS THOUGHT OR HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS LANGUAGE MODUL HAS ALL THESE COMPLEX ALTGRATEMS TO THEM AND THERE SIGNALING TO THE SPEECH CIRCUIT HOW TO PRODUCE THE SOUNDS THE HAND CIRCUIT HOW TO WRITE THEM OR GESTURE A THE VISUAL PATHWAY ON HOW TO INTERPRET THEM FROM READING A IN THE AUDITORY PATHWAY FOR LISTENING I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ASE I AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS THINKING WHE WHERE THERES IS INTERNAL SPEECH GOING ON WHAT I THINK IT'S GOING ON IS TO EXPLAIN WHICH YOU ASKING IS ABOUT AR GAN TO TAKE IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE READING SOMETHING YOU READ SOMETHING ON A PAPER THE SIGNAL FROM THE PAPER GOES THROUGH YOUR EYES IT GOES TO THE BACK YOUR BRAIN TO YOUR VISUAL CARTICAL REGIONS EVENTUALLY AND THEN YOU NOW GOT TO INTERPRET THAT SIGNAL IN YOUR VISUAL PATHWAY WHAT YOUE READING HOW R YOU GAN UNDO THAT FROM SPEECH TNHAT VISUAL SIGNAL THEN GOES TO YOUR SPEECH PATHWAY IN THE MOTOR QUORTSEXS IN FRONT HERE IN BROKAS ARIA AND YOU SIGN ATLAT SPEAK WHAT YOU READ IN YOUR BRAIN WITHOUT MOVING YOUR MUSCLES SOMETIMES ACTUALLY IF YOU PUT ELECTROES E E G A E M G ELECTROES ON YOU LOO L LORINGAL MUSCLES EVEN ON BURGING AND DO THIS YOU'LL SEE ACTIVITY THERE WHILE  READING OR OR OR TRYING TO SPEAK SILENTLY EVEN THOUGH NO SOUNDS COMING OUT AND SO YOU'RE SPEECH PATHWAY IS NOW SPEAKING WHAT YOU'RE READING NOW TO FINISH IT OFF THAT SIGNAL IS SENT TO YOUR AUDITORY PATHWAYS SO YOU CAN HEAR WHIH YA'RE SPEAKING IN YOUR OWN HEAD THAT'S INCREDIBLE AND THIS IS WHY IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU USING LIKE THREE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THE VISUAL THE SPEAKING MOTOR ONE IN THE AUDITORY TO READ OH AND THEN YU GOT A RIT I I C HERE COMES A FOURTH ONE NOW THE HAND AIRY IS NEXT OU SPEECH PATHWAY IS GOT TO TAKE THAT AUDITORY SIGNAL OR EVEN THE ADJACENT MOTOR SIGNALS FOR SPEAKING AND TRANSLATED INTO A VISUAL SIGNAL IN PAPER SO SO YOU USING AT LEAST FOUR BRAIN CIRCATES A WHICH INCLUDES THE SPEECH PRODUCTION IN THE SPEECH PERCEPTION PATHWAYS TO WRITES CREDIBLE AND FINALLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY WHEN I SO I WAS WEIND TEACHING UNDERGRADUATES GRADUATSUNE TO MEDICAL STUDENTS AND I'VE OBSERVED THAT WHEN I'M TEACHING I HAVE TO STOP SPEAKING IF I'M GOING TO WRITE SOMETHING ON THE BOARD I DID HAVE TO STOP ALL SPEAING COMPLETELY FRI TURNS OUT THIS IS AN ADVANTAGE TO CATCH BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO CATCH MY VOICE IT ALLOWS ME TO SLOW DOWN A BIT I'M YOU BREATHE AN AN HALSOME OXYGEN AND SO ON BECAUSE I TEND TO SPEAK QUICKLY IF I'M NOT WRITING SOMETHING OUT SO THERE'S A BRAKE IN THE CIRCUITRY FOR ME OR AT LEAST THEY ARE DISTINCT ENOUGH THAT I HAVE TO STOP AND THEN WRITE SOMETHING YES THAT THAT THAT THAT AS IMPLY COMPETING BRAIN CIRCUITS FOR YOU'RE CONSCIOUS ATTENTION WE HAVE COLLEAGUES IM UP AT COLUMBIA MET WHO ARE KNOWN AT LEAST AN HOUR CIRCLES FOR DICTATE VOICDICTATING THEIR PAPERS NOT WRITING THEM OUT BUT JUST SPEAKING INTO A VOICE RECORTER I'VE WRITTEN PAPERS THAT WAY IT DOESN'T FEEL QUITE AS NATURAL FOR ME AS WRITING THINGS OUT BUT  NOT BECAUSE I CAN GO QUICKLY FROM THOUGHT TO LANGUAGE TO TYPING I TYPE REASONABLY FAST I CAN TOUCH TYPE NOW I DON'T THINK I EVER TAUGHT MY I I THINK I TAUGHT MYSELF I NEVER TO A TOUCH TYPY ON HORSE WHICH SORT OF HAPPEN NOW IT HIM MY MOTOR SYSTEM SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE THE KEYS ARE WITH ENOUGH I  I ENOUGH ACCURACY THAT IT WORKS THIT THIS IS REMARKABLE TO ME THAT ANY OF US CAN DO THIS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THAT IF MY WRATE OF THOUGHT AND MY RATE OF WRITING ARE A LINE NICELY THINGS GO WELL AT HOWEVER IF I'M THINKING MUCH FASTER THAN I CAN WRITE THAT'S A PROBLEM AND CERTAINLY IF I'M THINKING MORE SLOWLY THAN I WANT TO WRITE THAT'S ALSO A PROBLEMAND THE SOLUTION FOR ME HAS BEEN TO WRITE WITH A PEN I'M IN LOVE WITH THESE  I HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE COMPANY LEAST NOT NOW ALTHOUGH IF THEY WANT TO COME ENIGH THEY WANT I WORK WITH US I LOVE THESE PILOT VE FIVEY SEVENS BECAUSE NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF THE ANKOR THE THE FEEL ALTHOUGH I LIKE THAT AS WELL BUT BECAUSE OF THE RATE THAT ALLOWS ME TO WRITE THEY WRITE VERY WELL SLOWLY AND THEY WRITE VERY WELL QUICKLY AND SO I'VE HAVE DIS THEORY SUPPORTED ONLY BY MY OWN ANIC DATA NO PURE REVIEWED STUDY THAT WRITING BY HAND IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN TYPING OUT INFORMATION IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT TIS MOTOR PATHWAY FOR WRITING IS BETTER ERE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT THAN THE MOTOR PATHWAY FOR FOR TYPING YET THAT THAT'S INTERESTING I'M AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY STUDIES I HAVE MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WELL BUT TRYIN TO PUT THIS INTO THE CONTACTS IF I HAD TO YNO DESIGNING EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS HERE THYOU TO EXPLAIN YOURE EXPERIENCE IN MIND IS THAT WRITING BY HAND I'M I WOULD ARGUE I REQUIRES A DIFFERENT SAT OF LE LESS SKILLS WITH THE FINGERS THEN TYPING SO YOU HAT YOU HAVE THE CORDINATE YOUR FINGERS MORE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND SO FORTH OF A TYPING I BUT ALSO WRITING BY HAND REQUIRES MORE ARM MOVEMENT IAND SO THEREFORE I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE I THE THE DIFFICULTY THERE COULD BE IN THE TYPES AND MUSCLES AND THE FINE MOTOR CONTROL YOU NEED OF THOSE MUSCLES ALONG WITH SPEAKING IN YOUR BRAIN AT THE SAME TIME SO BASICALLY I'M COURSE ON A BRUTE  MA SENSE THAT I A A PROMORE PRIMITIVE WRITING DEVICE WOULD WORK THAT'S RIGHT  YES BUT BUT LET ME LET ME AS WO THIS IN TURNS OF THE I MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE RA BUT I FIND IS I CAN WRITE I CAN WRITE SOMETHING FAT SIR BY HAND AM FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME COMPARED TO TYPING  THAT IS BECAUSE I THINK I I RUN OUT OF THE ENERGY IN MY ARM MOVEMENTS A FASTER THAN I RUN OUT OF MUSCLE ENERGY MY FINGER MOVEMENTS A AND I THINK IT TAKES A LONGER TIME FOR US TO WRITE WORDS WITHOUT FINGERS A BECAUSE AND IN TURNS OF THE SPEECH SO I THINK YOURE WRITING WHETHER IS MY HAND OR TYPING AND YOUR SPEECH THE ONLY WILL LINE VERY WELL IF YOU CAN TIPE AS FAST AS YOU CAN SPEECH OR WRITE AS FAST AS YOU CAN SPEAK IN YOUR HEAD I LOVE IT SO WHAT YOU'VE DONE IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IS CREATED A BRIDGE BETWEENG FOUGHT AND WRITING AND THAT BRIDGE IS SPEECH THAT BRIDGE IS SPEECH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT WHEN YOURE WRITING SOMETHING OUT YOUR SPEAKING IT TO YOURSELF AND IF YOUR SPEAKING FASTER THAN YOU CAN TYPE YOU GOT A PROBLEM YOU SEE I A I DO A NUMBER OF PODCAST EPISODES THAT ARE NOT WITH GAST AT SOLO EPISODES AND AS LISTENERS NOR THESE ARE VERY LONG EPISODES OFTEN TWO OR MORE HOURS AND UM WE JOKE AROUND THE PODCASTUDIO THAT I WILL GET LOCKED INTO A MODE OF SPEECH WERE SOME OF IT IS MORE ELABORATIVE AND UM ANECDOTAL AND THEN I'LL AND THEN I'LL PUNCH OUT UM SIMPLE DECLARATIVE SENTENCES I FIND IT VERY HARD TO SWITCH FROM ONE MODUAL TO THE NEXT THE THING THAT I HAVE DONE IN ORDER TO UM MAKE THAT TRANSITION MORE FLUID AND PREPT FOR THOSE PODCAST EPISODES IS ACTUALLY TO READ THE LYRICS OF SONGS AND TO SING THEM IN MY HEAD AS A WAY OF WARMING UP MY VOCAL CHORDS BUT U'M LUCKILY FOR THOSE AROUND ME A WHEN I DO THAT I'M NOT ACTUALLY SINGING AND SO THIS A WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME UM SUPPORTS THIS IDEA THAT EVEN WHEN WE ARE IMAGINING SINGING OR WRITING IN OUR MIND WE ARE EXERCISING OUR ROCAL CORDERS YOUR ACTION GETTING LITTLE LO POTENTIALS OF ELECTRICAL CURRENTS REACHING YOUR MUSCLES THERE WHICH ALSO MEANS YOUR EXERCISING YOUR SPEECH BRAIN CIRCUITS TO WITHOUT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW GOING WITH THE FULLOBONE ACTIVITY IN THE MUSCLES CREDIBLE YE AND THIS THIS IDEA OF SINGING HELPS YOU AS WELL A AM EVEN WITH PARKINSON'S PATIENCE AND SO FORFILLY WHENE TO SAY SOMETHING SING OR LISTENING TO MUSIC HELPS THE MOVEMENTER AND THE IDEA THERE IS THAT THE BRAIN CIRCUITS FOR SINGING OR LET' SAY THE FUNCTION OF THE BRIN CIRCUITS FOR SPEECH BEING USED FOR SINGING FIRST IS THE MORE ANCESTRAL TRAIT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S EASIER TO DO THINGS WITH SINGING SOMETIMES IN IT IS WITH SPEAKING OF IT STUTTER IS A A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING CASE AND AND ONE THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I I'LL GET QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS FROM OUR AUDIENCE AM STUTTER IS ITS COMPLICATED AND IN THA NUMBER OF WAYS BUT CULTURALLY A MI UNDERSTANDING FROM THESE FEMALES THAT I RECEIVE IS THAT A STUTTER CAN OFTEN A CAUSE PEOPLE TO HIDE AND SPEAK LESS BECAUSE IT CAN BE EMBARRASSING AND WERE WE ARE OFTEN NOT PATIENT WITH WITH STUTTER WE ALSO HAVE THE ASSUMPTION THAT IF SOMEBODY STUTTERING THAT THEY'RE THINKING A SLOW BUT IT TURNS OUT THEIRE MANY EXAMPLES HISTORICALLY OF PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT SPEAK WELL BUT WHOWERE BRILLIANT THINKERS A I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL THEY COULD WRITE BUT A THEY FOUND OTHER MODES OF COMMUNICATION A I REALISE THAT YOU'RE NOT A A SPEECH PYTHOLOGISTM OR THERAPIST BUT A WHAT IT'S THE CURRENT NERBIOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF STUTTER AND OR A WHAT'S BEING DEVELOPED IN TERMS OF TREATMENTS FOR STUTTER YES SO WE ACTUALLY A ACCIDENTALLY CAME ACROSS STUTTERING IN SOMBIRDS AND WE BE PUBLICH SEVERAL PAPERS ON THIS TO TRY TO FIGUREOUP THE NEROBIOLOGICAL BASIS THE FIRST STUDY WE HAD WAS A BRAINARIA A CALL THE BASO GANGLIA WITH THE THE STRIANUM PART OF THE BAS OF GANGLIA INVOLVED IN COORDINATING MOVEMENTS LEARNING HOW TO MAKE MOVEMENTS WHEN IT WAS DAMAGED IN THESE IN THES IN THE SPEECH LIKE PATHWAY IN THESE BIRDS IT WEFOUND IS THAT THEY STARTED TO STUTTER AS THE BRAIN REGION RECOVER AND UNLIKE HUMANS THEY ACTUALLY RECOVERED AFTER THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND WHY IS THAT THE CASE BECAUSE BIRD BRAINS UNDERGOES NEW NURGENISIS IN A WAY THAT HUMAN OR MAMEL BRAINS STONES AND IT WAS THE NEW NURONS THAT WERE COMING IN INTO THE CIRCUIT  BUT NOT QUITE YOU KNOW WITH THE RIGHT PROPER ACTIVITY WAS RESULTING IN THE STUTERING IN THESE BIRDS AND AFTER IS REPAIRED NOT EXACTLY THE OLD SONG CAME BACK AS A AF THE REPAIR BUT STILL I'V RECOVERED A LOT BETTER AND IT'S NOW KNOWN THEY CALL THIS NOURGEN NEUR GENICS A STUTTERING IN HUMANS I WULD BE DAMAGE TO THE BRASO GANGLIA OR SOME TYPE OF DISRUPTION TO THE BASOF GANGLE AT A YOUNG AGE ALSO CAUSES STUTTERING IN HUMANS AND EVEN THOSE WHO WERE BORN WITH STUTTERING AA IT'S IT'S OFTEN THE BASOF GANGLIA THAT'S DISERRUPTED IN SOME OF THE BRAIN CIRCUIT AND WE THINK THE SPEECH PART OF THE BAS OF GANGLE CAN ADULTS WHO MAINTAIN A STUTTER FROM CHILDHOOD A REPAIR THAT STUTTER THEY CAN REPAIRID WITH A THERIPY WITH LEARNING HOW TO SPEAK SLOWER A LEARNING HOW TO TAP OUT A RHYTHEM DURE IS THE AND YET I'M NOT A SPEECH PATHOLOGIST BY STODY READING THE SLITTERATURE AN TALKING TO OTHERS HAT YOU KNOW O CALLINGS WHO ACTUALLY STUDIES STUDY STUTTERING SO Y ES THIT THERE THERE ARE WAYS TO OVERCOME THE SUTTERING THROUGH A THROUGH A INO BEHAVIORAL THERAPY A AND I THINK ALL OF THE O TOOLS OUT THERE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH SENSORY MOTERINTOGRATION A CONTROLLING WITH YOU HERE WITH WHAT'S YOU OUTPUT IN THE OF THOUGHTFUL CONTROLLED WAY HELPS REDUCE THE SUTERY THEYR COUPLE EXAMPLES FROM REAL LIFE THAT I WANT A TOUCH ON AND A ONE IS SOMEWHAT FACETIOUS BUT A BUT NOW I REALIZE AS IT IS A SERIOUS ANEROBIOLOGICAL ISSUE SERIOUS MEANING I THINK INTERESTING WHICH IS THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY WHO SAYS THE LAST WORD OF THE SENTENCE ALONG WITH ME AND IT SEEMS ANNOYING IN SOME INSTANCES A BUT I'M GUESSING THIS IS JUST A BREAK THROUGH OF THE MOTOR PATTERN THAT THEY'RE HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING VERY WELL SOMMON INTERPRET THIS IT KINDLY AND THINK THEY'RE HEARING WHAT IM SAYING THEY'RE LITERALLY HEARING IT IN THEIR MINE AND THEY'RE GETTING THAT LOW LEVEL ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY TO THEIR THROAT AND THEYRE JUST JOINING ME IN THE A IN THE DENUNCIATION OF WHAT I'M SAYING PROBABLY WITHOUT REALIZING IT CAN WE ASSUME THAT THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE I I I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED OF YA MOTER THEORY OF SPEECH PERCEPTION WHERE THIS IDE ORISINALLY CAMEU TO HERE IIS GOING THROUGH YOUR SPECE CIRCIN AND THEN ALSO ACTIVITING THOSE MUSCLES SLIGHTLY A SO YES A SO ONE MIGHT ARGUE UKA IS THAT SPEECH CIRCUIT NOW INTERPRETING WHAT THAT PERSON IS SPEAKING NOW YOU LISTENING TO ME AND I'S GOING TO FINISH IT OFF BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY GOING THROUGH THEIR PRAIN AND THEY CAN PREDICTED THAT WOULD BE ONE ONE THEORY I DON'T THINK THE VERTICT OUT THERE IS NOW THAT'S ONE THE OTHER IS ASYCRINIZING TURN TAKING IN IN THE COI THE A CONVERSATION WHERE YOU'RE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A BY FINISHING OFF WHAT I SAY AIN IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SOCIAL BINDING KIND OF THING THE OTHER COULD BE I WANT THE PERSON IS SHUT OUT SO I CAN SPEAK AS WELL AND TAKE THAT TURN AND AND EATS PAIR OF PEOPLE HAVE A RHYTHM TO THEIR CONVERSATION AND IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S OVERTALKATIVE VERSES UNTOTALKATIV A VIRSE VERSEA THAVE RHYTHM CAN BE LOST IN THEM FINISHING IDEAS AND GOING BACK AND FORTH BUT I I THINK HAVING SOMETHING TO DO WITH TURNTAKING AS WELL MAKES A LOT OF SENCE I HAVE A COLLEGUE AT STAMFORD WHO IS A THAT INTERRUPTION IS A SIGN OF INTEREST I'M NOT SHOW THAT EVERYONE AGREES I THINK IT'S TIRELY CAN TEXTUOLD YES BUT THERE IS THIS FORM OF A A VERBAL NOD I'V SAYING OR THINGS OF THAT SORT AND THEY'R MANY OF THESE A AND I'M OFTEN TOLD BY MY AUDIENCE YOU KNOW THAT AT INTERRUPT MY GUESTS AN THINGS THAT SORT OFTENTIMES I'LL JUST GET CAUGHT IN THE NATURAL FLOW OF THE CONVERSATIO I A BUTI I THINK WE'VE HAVE PRETTY GOOD TURN TAKING HERE I HOPE THAT'S O FAR GOOD Y I BAWAY I'M GLAD UON YUL THATWAY BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTECTS OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT LANGUAGE IT SEEMS IMPORTANT A TEXTING IS A VERY VERY INTERESTING EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE TOLD US IS THAT WE HAVE A THOUGHT IT'S TRANSLATED INTO LANGUAGE IT MIGHT NOT BE COMPLETE SENTENCES BUT TEXTING I HAVE TO IMAGINE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN HUMAN EVOLUTION WHERE WE'VE WRITTEN WITH OUR THUMBS YOU KNOW SEEMS MORE PRIMITIVE TO ME THAN TIPING WITH THINGERS OR RI ANDS BUT HEY WHO M WHOM I TO JUDGE THE EVOLUTION OF OUR SPECIES IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER BUT THE SHORT HAND GRAMMATICALLY OFTEN GRAMMATICALLY DEFICIENT INCOMPLETE SENTENCE FORM OF TEXTING IS AN INCREDIBLE THING TO SEE A EARLY IN RELATIONSHIPS ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS PEOPLE WILL OFTEN EVALUATE THE OTHERS TEXT IN THEIR ABILITY TO USE PROPER GRAMMAR AND SPELLING ET CETERA DIS OFTEN QUICKLY DEGRADES AND THERE'S AN ACCEPTANCE THAT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH SHORTHAND ALMOST A MILITARY LIKE SHORTHAND BUT WITH INTERNALLY CONSISTENT BETWEEN PEOPLE BUT THERE'S NO GENERAL CONSENSES OF WHAT THINGS ME BUT YOU KNOW A W T FS AND LIG AND OH M GS AND ALL SORTS OF WRITINGS I WONDER SOMETIMES WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GETTING LESS PROFICIENT AT SPEECH BECAUSE WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO WRITE AND THINK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES I I'M NOT BEIN JUDGE IMENTAL HERE I SEE THIS IN MY COLLEGUES I SEE THIS IN MYSELF THIS IS NOT A A JUDGMENT OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION A I ALSO KNOW THAT SLANG HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES IF NOT HUNDREDS OF YEARS BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT I DON'T SPEAK THE SAME WAY THAT I DID WHEN I WAS A TEEN AGER BECAUSE I'VE SUPPRESSED A LOT OF THAT SLANG NOT BECAUSE IT'S IN APPROPRIATE A OR OFFENSIVE ALTHOUGH SOME OF IT WAS FRANKLY A BUT BECAUSE IT'S OUT OF CONTEXT SO WHAT O YOU THINKS HAPPENING TO LANGUAGE ARE WE GETTING BETTER AT SPEAKING WORSE AT SPEAKING AND WHAT DO YOU THING THE ROLE OF THINGS LIKE TETING AND TWEETING AND SHORTHAND COMMUNICATION HASH TAGGING A WHAT'S THAT DOING TO THE WAY THAT OUR BRAINS WORK I I THINK THAT  THE ONE IN TERMS OF A YOU KNOW  MEASURING YOUR LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION INTELLIGENCE THAN YOU SAY OM G I I THINK THAT ALSO COULD BE A CULTURAL THING THAT A YOU BELONG TO THE NEXT GENERATION IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE BEING COLD IF YOUR OLDER PERSON TE USING UNDN OTHER THINGS AT THE THENO YOUNGER GENERATION WITH YOUS BUT I REALLY THINK ABOUT A CLEARLY A A TEXTING ACTUALLY HAS A LOWD FOR MORE RAPID COMMUNICATION AMONGST PEOPLE I I I THINK WITH WITHOUT THE INVENTION OF THE PHONE BEFORE THEN OR YOU KNOW A TEXING BACK AND FORTH HE HAD TO WAIT DAYS FOR A LETTER TO SO UP YUYOU COULDN'T CALL SOMEBODY IN TH PHONE AND TALK AS WELL YOU KNOWND SO THIS RAPID COMMUNICATION BUT IN TURNS OF THE RAPID COMMUNICATION OF WRITING IN THIS CASE A SO I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE A USE IT OR LOSE IT KIND OF AA A THING WITH THE BRAIN THE MORE YOU USE A PARTICULAR BRAIN REGION OR CIRCUIT THE MORE INHANCE IT'S LIKE A MUSCLE A THE MORE YOU EXERCISE IT THE MORE HEALTHIER IT IS THE BIGGER BECOMES IN THE MORE SPACE IT TAKES IN THE WERE YOU LOSE SOMETHING ELSE SO I THINK TAXING I MY IS NOT DECREASING O THE THE THE SPEECH PROWESS OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROWESS OF SPEECH IT'S CONVERTING IT AND USING AT A LOT IN A DIFFERENT WAY AIN A WAY THAT MAY NOT BE AS RICH IN IN REGULAR WRITING BECAUSE A OU CAN ONLY COMMUNICATE SO MUCH NEW ONCE IN SHORT WRIGT TERM WRITING BUT ON WHATEVER THAT IT WHATEVER IS BEING DONE YOU GOT PEOPLE TEXING HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS ON THE FUNE SO WHATEVER YOUR THUMB CIRCUIT IS GOING TO GET PRETTY BIG ACTUALLY I I DO WONDER WHETHER YOURE MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS BASED ON TWEETS A THE SHORT LATENCY BETWEEN THOUGHT AND ACTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ONE'S THOUGHTS IS IS INCREDIBLE YES AND N WHAT I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A WHO APPARENTLY WOULD HAVE POOR PREFRONTAL TOP DOWN CONTROL THIS IS BEAK SPEAK BY THE WAY FOR PEOPLE THAT LACK IMPULSE CONTROL BUT HIGH LEVEL ACADEMICS ON I CAN APPOINT AN FINGERS AN ANY ONE BUT EXAMPLES OF IN WHERE YOU SEE THESE TREATING WHAT WERE THEY THINKING YET A SO PRESOMENLY THERE'S AN OPTIMAL A STRATEGY BETWEEN THE THE THOUGHT SPEECH MOTOR AT MOTOR PATHWAY USHIN WHEN THE MOTOR PATHWAY ENGAGES COMMUNICATION WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND RETWEATS AND PARTICULAR IN THE COTTON PACTE FUNCTION AND THE SCREEN SHOT FUNCTION ARE OFTEN THE REASON WHY SPEECH PROFLAGATES YET SO TO ME IT'S IT'S A LITTLE EARE THAT A THE JUST THAT THE NORAL CIRCUITRY CAN DO THIS AND THAT WE ARE CATCHING UP A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY TO THE TECHNOLOGY AND YOUV GOT THESE CASUALTIES OF OF THAT MISMATCH II I THINK THAT'S A GOOD A ADJUTIVES  USE THE CASUALTIES YOU KNOW OF WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE YES IT IS THE CASE WOULD TEXING WHICH AE REALLY LOSING THER IS NOT LESS SO DEBILITY TO WRITE THE MORE THE ABILITY TO INTERPET WHAT IS BEING WRITTEN AND YOU CAN OVER UNDERTERPIT SOMETHING O THAT SOMEBODY MEANS A ON THE FLIPSIDED THAT YOU KNOW WHEN IF SOMEBODY'S WRITING SOMETHING VERY QUICK ATHEY COULD BE WRITING INSTINCTUALLY MORE INSTINCTUALLY THEIR NTRUE MEANING AND THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO MODIFY AN COLOR CODE WHAT THEIR TRYING O SAY AND THAT'S WHAT THEY REALLY FEEL IAS SUPPOSE TO SAYIN A MORE NEW ONE'S WAY SO I I THINK BOTH SIDES OF THAT CASUALTY ARE OUR PRESENT AND THAT'S A DOWN TURN YOU KNOW UNINTENDED A NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE OF A SHORT COMMTERM I' M EAN SHORT WORD COMMUNICATION I AGREE THAT A THIS WHOLE PHENOMENA COULD BE NETTING PEOPLE THAT A NORMALLY WOULD ONLY SAY THESE THINGS OUT LOUD ONCE INSIDE THE DOOR OF THEIR OWN HOME AR NOT AT ALL I THAT'S A IT'S AN INTERESTING TIME THAT WEREIN LES OFE SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AN MOER AND MOTOR PATTERN THE PART OF THE HUMAN EVOLUTION FOR LANGUAGE I I I THINK THIS IS ALL PART OF OUR EVOLUTION NOT SRIT AS OVER THOSE OF YOU THINKING TERRIBLE THOUGHTS PLEASE PUT THEM IN THE WORLD AND BE A CASUALTY AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WITH HOW PROFICIENT YOURE THOUGHT TO LANGUAGE TO MOTOR ACTION YES IO MAYBE THIT'S THE TECHNOLEGY COMPANYS SHOULD INSTALL SOME BUFFERS I'M SOME A I BASED BUFFERS RIGHT THAT THAT'S TAKING SOME E G SIGNALS FROM YOUR BRAIN WHILE YOUR TAXINGS TO SAY O CA THIS THIS IS A YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A GREAT THOUGHT SLOW DOWN IT NO  THIS DOESN'T REFLECT YOUR BESTYASTATE THAT BRINGS ME TO THAT WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT QUESTION ANYWAY WHICH IS WE ARE QUICKLY MOVING TOWARD A TIME WHERE THERE WILL BE A EVEN FASTER TRANSITION FROM THOUGHT TO SPEECH TO MOTOR OUTPUT AND MAYBE WON'T REQUIRE MOTOR OUT BUT WHAT I'M REFERRING TO HEAR SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE WORK OF OUR COLLECS ATY CHANG AT YOU SEE A SAFF AND OTHERS WHO ARE TAKING A PARALYZED HUMAN BEINGS AM AND LEARNING TO TRANSLATE THE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS OF NURONS IN VERIUSARRIES INCLUDING SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ARIOUS TO COMPUTER SCREENES THAT TYPE OUT WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE THINKING ANOTHERWORDS PARALYZED PEOPLE CAN PUT THEIR THOUGHTS ON IN INTO WRITING THAT'S A PRETTY EXTREME AND WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF RECOVERY OF FUNCTION THAT IS SURE TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE BUT I THINK WE ARE HEADED TOWARD A TIME NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW WHERE MY THOUGHTS CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO WORDS ON A PAGE IF I ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN YES SO AND ANY THANG'S WORK I WHICH I ADMIRE QUITE A BIT IN SITEIN MY PAPERS II THINK HE'S REALLY ONE OF THOSE AT THE LEADING EDGS A TRYG O I UNDERSTAND WITHIN HUMANS A THE THE NURVILGIO SPEECH AND HE MAY NOT SAY IT DIRECTLY THAT I NI TAUNKIN ABOUT THIS THAT SUPPORTS THIS IDEA THAT THE SPEECH CIRCUIT IN TH SEPARATE LANGUAGE MODUL I DON'T REALLY A THINK THAT THERE'S A SEPARATION THERE SO WITH WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE YET OF PUTTING ELECTRODES IN THE HUMAN BRAIN AND THEN TRANSLATING THOSE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO SPEAKS A CCURRENCE YET WE CAN START TO TELL WHAT IS THAT PERSON THINKING WHY BECAUSE WE OFTEN THINK IN TERMS OF SPEECH IAND DON WITHOUT SAYING WORDS AND THAT'S A SCARRY A THOUGHT AND NOW IMAGINE IF YOU CAN NOW TRANSLATE THOS INTO A SIGNAL THAT TRANSMIT SOMETHING WIRELESSLY AND SO ON FROM SOME DISTANT PART OF THE PLANING IS HEARING YOUR SPEECH FROM A WIRELESS SIGNAL I WITHOUT YOU SPEAKING A SO PROBABLY THAT WON'T BE DONE AT IN A ETHICAL WAY WHO KNOWS YOU KNOW TUT THA I MEAN THE ETHICS OF DOING THAT PROBABLY YOU KNOW MYGHT NOT HAPPEN BUT WHO KNOWS WE HAVE THESE SOMBERDS YOU KNOW WE IMPLY THE SAME TECHNE TO THEM WE CAN START TO HEAR WHAT THEIR SINGING IN THEIR DREAMS OR WHATEVER I EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T PRODUCE SOUNDS O WE CAN FIND OUT BY TESTING ON THEM IT'S COMING NO WHERE NOTNOT OMIN FOR THOSE LISTENING WHO ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING BETTER AT SPEAKING AND UNDERSTANDING LANGUAGES ARE THERE ANY TOOLS THAT YOU RECOMMEND AND HERE AGAIN I T I RELES YOU'RE NOT A SPEECH TERAPIS BUT HERE I'M NOT THINGING ABOUT AMELIORATING ANY KIND OF IM SPEECH DEFICIENCY I' THINKING FOR INSTANCE DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE READ DIFFERENT TYPES OF WRITING IM WOULD YOU RECOMEND THET PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO DANCE IN ORDER TO BECOME BETTER AT EXPRESSING THEMSELVES VERBALLY IM YOU KNOW IT AND YOU'LL FREE TO HAVE SOME SOME DEGREES OF A FREEDOM IN THIS DANCER THIS ESE ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT A PURE VIEWED STUDIES THAT WERE REFERRING TO OR ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE IM BUT I'M STRUCK BY THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU DO EXCEEDINGLY WELL AND I CAN'T HELP BUT ASK A WELL THET THE SINGING WHICH I REALIZE IT MADE  YOUR BROTHER DIDN PAY ME I SAY THIS MAY NOT BE QUITE AS GOOD AS YOUR BROTHERS YET BY IS GETTING YOU'LL SURPASS HIM MADM MA'AM GUESSING IT ANY OINT THE YETI IS NOT EXACTLY THERE A YOU KDON'T SHOULD KIDS LEARN HOW TO DANCE AND READ HARD BOOKS AND SIMPLE BOOKS A WHAT YOU RECOMMEN SHOULD ADULTS LEARN HOW TO DO THAT YOU EVERONE WANTS TO KNOW HOW TO KEEP THEIR BRAIN WORKING BETTER SO TO SPEAK BUT ALSO I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WELL YE SO BUT I'VE DISCOVERED PERSONALLY YOUR IT IS THAT SO WHEN I WICH FROM APURSUING A CREER IN SCIENCE FROM A CAREER IN DANCE IM I THOUGHT ONE DAY I WOULD STOP DANCING I BUT I HAVEN'T BECAUSE  I FIND IT FULFILLING FOR ME IM YOU KNOW JUST AS A LIFE EXPERIENCE SO EVER SINCE I ANTE STARTED COLLEGE YOU KNOW MY A LATTEENS IN EARLY TWENTIESE I I KEPT DANCING EVEN TILL THISS DAY AND THEY'VE EEMPURI A TIME LIKE TDURING THE PANDEMIC WHERE I SLOW DOWN ON DANCING AND SO FOR IM AND AND WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU REALIZE LOO CAY THET THER PARTS OF YUR BODY WHERE YOU MUSCLETONE DECREASES LITT IT IN SOME ON AN OR YOU COAND START TO GAINWAY OR I SOMEHOW DON'T THAN WAIT THAT EASILEN I THINK IT'S RELATED TO MY DANCE IF THAT'S THAT THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO YOUR AUDIENCE  BUT WUT I FOUND IS IN IN IN SCIENCE WE LIKE TO THINK OF A SEPARATION BETWEEN MOVEMENT AND ACTION AND COGNITION AND THERE IS A SEPARATION FROM YOU BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND PRODUCTION COGNITION BEING PERCEPTION PRODUCTION BEING MOVING RIGHT BUT IF THE SPEECH PATHWAYS IS NEXT IN THE MOVEMENT PATHWAYS WHUT I DISCOVER IS BY DANCING IT IS HELPIN ME THINK IT IS HELPING KEEPING MY BRAIN FRESH IT'S NOT JUST MOVING MY MUSCLES I'M MOVING ORE USING THE THE CIRCUITRY IN MY BRAINS IN TO CONTROL A WHOLE BIG BODY YOU NEED A LOT OF BRAIN TISSUE TO DO THAT AND SO I ARGUE IF YOU WANT TO SAY COGNITIVELY IN TACT INTO YOUR OLD AGE YOU BETTER BE MOVING AND YOU BETTER BE DOING IT CONSISTENTLY WHETHER F IT'S DANCING WALKING RUNNING AND ALSO PRACTISING SPEECH ORITORY SPEECH AND SO FAR FOR SINGING IS CONTROLLING THE BRAINS CIRCUITS THAT ARE MOVING YOUR FACIAL MUSCULATURE AND IT'S GOING KEEP YOUR COGNITIVE CIRCUITS ALSO INTO AND I'M I'M CONVINCED OF THAT FOR MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE  FOR ME A LONG SLOW RUNS AR A WONDERFUL WAY TO KIND OF LOOSEN THE JOINTS FOR LONG PODCASTS ESPECTLLY THE SOLO PODCASTS WHICH CAN TAKE MANY HOURS TO RECORD AND A WITHOUT THOSE LONG SLOW RUNS AT LEAST THE DAY BEFORE OR EVEN THE MORNING OF I DON'T THINK I COULD DO IT LEAST NOT AS WELL AE RIGHT WELL YOU'RE YOUR EXPERIENCING SOMETHING SIMILAR SO THAT'S AN END OF TO A DON'T YOU I'M IM TEMPTED TO LEARN HOW TO DANCE BECAUSE ATHER'RE LOT OF REASONS TO LEARN HOW TO DAPEOPLE CAN'T USE THEIR IMAGINATION I DEVILLY WANTING GET THE OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE NEWER WORK THAT YOU'RE INTO RIGHT NOW A ABOUT GENOMES OF ANIMALS A AS YOU PERHAPS CAN TELL FROM MY QUITE AUTHENTICS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS I I ADORE THE ANIMAL KINGDOM I JUST FIND IN AMAZING AND IT'S WHAT THE REASON I WENT INTO NEROBIOLOGY IN PART A SO MANY ANIMALS SO MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF MOVEMENT SO MANY BODY PLANS SO MANY SPEC SPECIALIZATIONS WHAT IS THE VALUE OF LEARNING THE GENOMS OF ALL THESE ANIMALS IT YOU KNOW I CAN THINK OF ACONSERVATION BASE YOU KNOW SCHEMES OF TRYNG TO PRESERVE THESE PRESSIONS A CRITTERS AM BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE GENOMES OF THESE ANIMALS WHAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THEIR BRAIN CIRCUITS AND HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WE'VE HAVE BEEN HAVING UPI I I'VE GOT VERY HEAVILY INVOLVED IN GENOMS AM YOU'R NOT JUST TO GET AT AN INDIVIDUAL GENE INVOLVED IN THE TRADE OF INTERESTS LIKE SPOKEN LANGUAGE 'M BUT I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW NATURE HAS DONE NATURAL EXPERIMENTS FOR US AM BUT ALL THESE SPECIES OUT THERE WITH THESE VARIOUS TRAITS AND THE ONE THAT I'M STUDY LIKE BOKA LEARNING HAS EVOLVED MULTIPLE TIMES AMONG THE ANIMAL KING THEM EVEN IF ITS RARE IT'S MULTIPLE TIMES AND A TI SIMILAR GENETIC CHANGE AS OCCURRED IN THE SPECIES BUT TO FIND OUT WHAT THOSE GENETIC CHANGES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRAD OF INTERESTS AND NOT SOME OTHER TRAIT LIKE FLYING IN BIRDS IS SUPPOSED TO A SINGING A YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT CALL COMPARATIVE GENOMICS EVEN IN THE CONTACTS OF STUDYING THE BRAIN AND YOU NEED THEIR GENOMS TO COMPARE THO GENOMS AND DO LIKE A GEWAS TO GENO WIDE ASSOCIATIONS STUDY NOT JUST WITH IN A SPECIES LIKE HUMANS BUT A CROSS SPECIES AND SO YOU NEED A GO GENOS TO DO THAT PLUS I DISCOVERED I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN EVOLUTION AND ORIGINS HOW DID THESE SPECIES COME ABOUT ASSIMILAR TRAIT AND A IN INLAST MEO THREE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS OR SIXTY MILLION YEARS TE PENDING YOU TALKING ABOUT A AND YOU NEED A GOOD FILOGENETIC TREE TO DO THAT AND TO GET A GOOD VILOGENETIC TREE YOU ALSO NEED THEIR GENOS AND SO BECAUSE OF THIS I GOT INVOLVED IN LARGE SCALE CONTORTIANS TO PRODUCE GENOMS OF MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES INCLUDING MY VOCAL LEARNERS IN MY THEIR CLOSEST RELATIVES THAT I'M FANS OF  BUT I COULDN'T CONVINCE THE FUNDING AGENCIES TO GIVE ME THE MONEY TO TO DO THAT JUST FOR MY OWN PROJECT BUT WHEN YOU GET A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE TOGETHER WHO WANT TO STUDY VARIOUS TRAITS YOU KNOW A HEART DISEASE OR WHAT OR LOSSIN GAINA FLIGHT AND SO FORTH SUDDENLY WE ALL NEED LOTS OF GENONS TO DO THIS AND SO NOW THAT GOT ME INTO A PROJECT TO LEAD ON THE CALLD A VERTIPA GENON'S PROJECT TO EVENTUALLY SEQUENCE ALL SEVENTY THOUSAND SPECIES ON THE PLANET AAND A EARTH VILOGENO PROJECT ALL VEW CARRIOTIC SPECIES ALL TWO MILLION OF THEM A AND AND TO NO LONGER BEING A SITUATION WHERE I WISH I HAD THIS GENO NOW WE HAVE THE GENETIC CODE OF ALL LIFE ON THE PLANET CREATA DATA BASE OF ALL THEIR TRAITS AND FIND THE GENETIC ASSOCIATION WITH EVERYTHING  OUT THERE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FROM ONE SPECIES TO ANOTHER A ONE MORE PIECE OF A OF THE EQUASION TO ADD TO THIS STORY IS WOUT I DID 'T REALIZES A NEUROSCIENTIS WERE THAT THESE GENOS OR NOT ONLY IN COMPLETE ABUTTHERE HAVE LOTS OF ERRORS IN THEM FALSE GENE DUPLICATIONS WERE MOTHER AND FATHER CROMISTONES WERE SO DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER THAT THE GENO MALGAR THAN ASSEMILIOGRATHEMS TRATED THEM AS TWO DIFFERENT GENES IN THIS PART OF THE CHRIMISON ALSO THERE A LOT OF THESE FALSE DUPLICATED GENES THAT PEOPLE WERE THOUGHT WERE REAL BUT WERE NOT WERE MISSING PARTS OF THE GENO BECAUSE THE ENZINE GUS TO SEQUENCE THE GEANA COULDN'T GET THROUGH THIS REGULAR TORY REGION THAT FOLDED UP ON ITSELF AAND AMADE IT HARD TO SEQUENCS AND SO I AN UP IN IN THESE CONTORTIUMS  PULLING IN THE GENOM SEQUENCE IN COMPANIES DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY TO WORK WITH US TO IMPROVE IT FURTHER IN THE COMPUTER  SCIENCE GUIDES WHO THEN TAKE THAT DATA IN THA TECHNOLOGY AND TRY TO MAKE THE COMPLETE GENOS AND MAKE THE ALGARDANS BETTER TO PRODUCE WHAT WE NOW JUST DID RECENTLY AND  LED BY AN EFFORT BY ADAN PHILIPY IS THE FIRST HUMAN TELA MERITELA RGENO WITH NO ERRORS ALL COMPLETE NO MISSING SEQUENCE AND NOW ERE TRYING TO DO THES SAME THING WITH VERTIBRATES IN OTHER SPECIES ACTUALLY WE IMPROVE THAT BUTE BEFORE WE GOT TO WHAT WE CALLE TELAMERDOTELAMER FROM ONE END OF FROM US OM TO ANOTHER AND WHAT WERE DISCOVERY IS IN THIS DARK MATTER OF THE GENO THAT WAS MISSING BEFORE TURNS OUT TO BE SOME REGULATORY REGIONS THAT ARE SPECIALIZED INVOCAL LEANING SPECIES AND WE THINK ARE INVOLVED IN IN DEVELOPING SPEET CIRCUITS INCREDIBLE WA SO WHAC TO LEARN AND THAT THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS INFORMATION WEARLY AUGHT IN THESE GENON PROJECTS IN CONNECTONE PROJECTS I CONFESS I WAS A LITTLE BUT CYNICLE T S SOULD BE AT BUT TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I I THOUGLOOKING NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ANYTHING A WE NEED IT BHAT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT'S CAN O HAPPEN BUT YOU JUST GAVE A VERY CLEAR EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE STAND TO LEARN FROM THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AND A AND I KNOW FROM THE CONSERVATIONSIDE THERE'S A HUGE INTEREST IN THIS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD PREFER TO KEEP ALL THESE SPECIES ALIVE RATHER THAN CLOME THEM THEIR THESE SORTS OF PROJECTS DO OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF POTENTIALLY RECREATING SPECIES THAT WERE LOST I DUE TO OUR OWN IGNORANCE OR A MISDAP OR WHAT HAVE YOU YES AND ND ALONG THOSE LINES A BECAUSE NO WE GOT INVOLVED IN GENOMICS SOME OF THE FIRST SPECIES THAT WE START WORKING ON ARE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES AND IM DOING THAT NOT ONLY FOR A FOR UNDER YO PROSPECTIVES TO UNDERSTAND TEIR BRAINS IN THE GENES INVOLVED IN THE BRAIN FUNCTION BUT I FEEL LIKE ITS A MORAL DUTY SO THE FACT THAT NOW I BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN GENO BIOLOGY AND HAVE HELPE DEVELOPE THESE TOOLS FROM WORE COMPLEGENOS LET'S CAPTURE ER THEIR GENETICODE NOW BEFORE THEY'RE GONE AND COULD WE USE THAT INFORMATION A TO RESURRECT THE SPECIES THAT SOME FUTURE TIME IF NOT IN MY LIFETIME IN SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE IN GENERATIONS AHEAD OF US AND SO ON IN DO IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT WE CREATED DATE BASE WE CALLED THE GENO MARK AIN IN NO PUNINTENDED LIKE NOA'S ARK A MEANT TO STORE THE GENETIC CODE AS COMPLETE GENOM ASSEMBLIES AS POSSIBLE FOR ALL SPECIES ON THE PLANET A TO BE USED FOR BASIC SIENCE BUT ALSO SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE AND BECAUSE OF THAT FINDING AGENSEES O PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE INSTERSENT AN CONSURVACION HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO MENOW A NURA SCIENCIS A TO HELP THEM OUT IN PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY GENO DATA OF INDANGERED SPECIES THAT THEY CAN USE LIKE REVIVE IN RESTORE WHO ONE O RESURRECT O PASSENGER PIGION WERE COLOSSAL WHO WANTS THE RESURRECT THE WULLY MAMAS AND SO WERE PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY GENOS FOR THESE GROUPS FOR THEIR CONSUVATION PROJECTS WHTA TERRIFIC AND IMPORTANT INITIATIVE ND I THINK FOR THOSE LISTING TO DAY THEY NOW CERTAINL E UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF UNDEROF DEEPLY UNDERSTANDING THE BRAIN STRUCTURES AND GENOMES OF DIFFERENT SPECIES BECAUSE I CONFESS EVEN THOUGH I KNEW A BIT OF THE SONG BIRD LITERATURE AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT HUMANS HAVE SPEECH AND LANGUAGE I'D NO IDEA THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH CONVERGENCE OF FUNCTION STRUCTURE AND GENOMES AND TO ME YOU NO FEEL A LOT MORE LIKE A A AIN'T THAN I DO A SONG BIRD I AND YET HERE WE ARE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE SIMILARITY BETWEEN SONG BIRDS AND HUMAN AND I CERTAINLY EVER THOUGHT BEFORE A SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO HOME FOR US HUMANS I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF IS EVOLUTION OF SKIN COLOR A INO IN SKIN COLOR WE USE IT UNFORTUNATELY FOR RACISM AND SO FOR WE USE IT ALSO FOR GOOD THINGS TO LET IN MORE LIGHT OR LET OUT LESS LIGHT DEPENDING ON THE PART OF TH PLANED YOU KNOW OUR POPULATION EVOLVE THAN AND MOST PEOPLE THINK DARK SKIN PEOPLE ALL EVOLVE IN THE SAME DARK SKIN PERSON IN LIGHTSKIN PEOPLE WILL EVOLVE IN THE SAME LIGHTSKIN PERSON BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE DARK SKIN AND LIGHT SKIN AMONGST HUMANS HAS EVOLVED INDEPENDENTLY MULTIPLE TIMES LIKN YOU KNOW THE PACIFIC ILANDS VERSES AFRICA AND AN IT'S JUST THEPENDING ON THE ANGLE OF LIGHT HITTING THE EARTH AS

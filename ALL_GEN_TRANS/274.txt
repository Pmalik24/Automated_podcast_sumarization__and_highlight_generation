CONFINED FOR WEEKS NOW THE RELATIONSHIPS BEING REMOULDED BY THE LOCK DOWN IT'S AN ACCELERATOR IT'S A RELATIONSHIP ACCELERATOR SO IT IT IT REARRANGES THE PRIORITY AND CHOS THE SUPERFLUOUS OVERBOARD YOU KNOW IN A VERY SLARIFYING WAY FOR MANY OF THES WONE DIN WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH COUPLES I REACHED ACT TO ESTERE PARAL WHIS COUPLES THERAPIST IF YOU'VE HEARD OF HER SHE'S BUBBY BEST KNOWN FOR THIS IDEA FROM HER BOOK MADING IN CAPTIVITY THET TAKES IT HALL ON COUPLES AND KILLS PASSION WHEN THERES NOT ENOUGH DISTANCE BETWEE THE PARTNERS THEY TURNED TO EACH OTHER FOR EVERYTHING FOR FRIENDSHIP AND THE SENSE OF IDENTITY AND COMFORT AND EVERYTHING A WHOLE VILLAGE IS TO PROVIDE A PERSON IT'S VERY WARE THAT UNDER LOCK DOWN PEOPLE ARE WITERALLY TURNING TO THE PARTNERS FOR EVERYTHING THESE DAYS SHE SING A FUL SCHEDUL OF COUPLES MORE THAN SHE USUALLY DOES INTERESTINGLY SHE SAYS IS IS AN UNUSUALLY GOOD MOMENT FOR THERAPY UT T LOCK DOWN LOTS OF CLINTS R OPENING UP PINGING OUT THINGS IN WAYS THAT DON'T MORMY IT' SOME OF THE MEN IN THE COUPLES IT'S LIKE FOR THE FIRST TAND THEY ACTUALLY DOING THER IT'S EXCITING PRO BASINGLY BECAUSE THEY STOP THEY SLOW DOWN THEIR HOME AND IN THERTHEYR LIKE THEY LIKE THIS BLOSSOMING O OPENING OTHING WELL THREE DOOT YOU KNOW THREE MEN AND A IT'S JUST EXIT LIKE I DO'ONLY GET OFF THE FON BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S VERY MOVING FROM MOST OR THE COUPLES THAT YOUR SEEING WHAT'S YOUR SENSE HAS THE LOCK DOWN BEEN GOOD FOR THEM PREPARED FOR THEM SOO IT'S AS SUCH AN INTERESTING TING TO SAY AN REALLY BOTH REALLY BO THAT CON'T SAY ONE OR THE OTHER COUPLES STRUGGLING THE MOUSTAR PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY THE ONE SHOU'D EXPAT PEOPLE WHO EVEN BEFORE ALL THIS WERE QUICK TO PICK AT THEIR PARTNERS AND CRITICIZE THEM AND ARGUE OVER WHOSE SACRIFICING MOST FOR WHOM BUT ALSO THEN THIS MONDIN ONE OUR LIVES A BEEN SO PROFOUNDLY DISERRUPTED ANOTHER GROUP DOING BADLY PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW THEY'VE LOST SOME ONE OR THEY HAVE SOME ONE WHOS SICK OR THEY ARE THEY ARE ANXIOUS THEY ARE WORRIED AND BASICALLY THEIR PARTNER IS UNABLE TO HAVE AN EMPHATIC RESPONSE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU WORRYD TABOUT IT'S NITE THAT THERE'S NOTHING YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE TELL YOU YU KNOW MY PARTNER IS THE LAST PERSON I'M TURNING TO FOR ANYTHING I'M FEELING WIT NOW IT'S LIKE I HAVE NOWHERE TO GO WIT THIS TO JUST CAND OF BE ABLE TO BE UPSET OR SCARED OR THIS CONSTANT SENSE OF LOST JUST OS THE LOW THE WORLD THEY'VE KNOWN THEYR OWNT IDENTITY THER WORK ALL OF THAT THE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ALSO DRIVING PEOPLE TO REPRIOUR TIE THE STARE SEEN COUPLES SPLIT UP ANOTHERS MOVE IN TOGETHER AND BUT IF I MOST FASCINATING RO REVERSALS SHE'S CAUDING ONE COUPLE WHERE ONE OF THE PARTNERS WAS ALWAYS SEEN AS THE INSECURE ONE SHE'D STRUGGLED THROUGH A DRAMATIC CHILDHOOD ITS AGREED BETWEEN THE TWO WITH THEM THAT SHE WAS THE TROUPLED ONE WHO WEND IN HER STRONGER MOR TOGETHER PARTNER BUT NOW IT THE DEGLY VIRUS EVERYWHERE SHE FOUND THAT HER DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD GAVE HER ALL KINDS OF COPING HE MANAGING SKILLS

PAST YEAR R SO I'VE PERSONALLY SPOKEN TO NINE OF THEM IN THREE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ONLY ONE WAS ABLE TO GET HER SN OUT OF CHINA THANKS TO AN INFLUENTIAL FAMILY MEMBER AND A TURKISH PASSPORT STILL OBDER ROMAN WAS CONVINCED THAT HE TA GUY WHO DOESN'T SPEA COMMANDER AND DOESN'T HAVE POLITICAL CONNECTIONS CAN'T EVEN CALL HOME HE WAS GOING TO GET A SON BACK REPORTED DERY BUSCARAN COMING OUT ABDR ROMIN USES EVERYTHING HE HAS TO GET HIS FAMILY BACK THAT'S IN A MINUTE CICAGO PUP A GRADIO WHEN OUR PROGRAMME CONTINUES THIS MARI AN LY FROM OUR GLASS TODAY'S PROGRAMME BLACK BOX SURE IS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AND WANT TRYING TO FEGRAT WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT THEY SHOULD DO NEXT WE NOW CONTINUE WITH ACT ONE OF OUR SHEL AND FOR THE BRAK MAY BE HEARD OBDEROMANTOTY THOUGHT THAT HE SPOTTED HIS FOUR YEAR OLD SON ON A TIKTOC VIDIO DECIDED SET OUT ON A MISSION TO RETREVE HIM AND THE REST OF HIS FAMILY THEPORTEDERYBU SCARAN PICKS UP WITHOB DE ROMIN' STORY THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS HE WENT TO THE PRESS MADE A PUBLIC THIS WAS RISKY BECAUSE HIS FAMILY WAS STILL IN CHINA HIS INTERVIEWS WERE PUBLISHED ALL OVER THE WORLD IN TURKISH ENGLISH PORTUGUESE HE WAS ON THE BBY C AND IN THE NEW YORK TIMES WER TEO TIN TIN GEN  LE INMEDIATENTION LA SITIN TENS IGAN TIS COR WAS THAT MAKE ME ONTHAT MAKES ME HAVE MOR HOLL AND TRUST OR THE THE SINT OCAT TO SOMETHING MAYBE  HAPPEN BUT THEN I FIND THAT TE SI CILL NOT HAPPEN TOCEANKE LONISH A CLON ITON ON THIS WITH EACH OF THESE INTERVIEWS IT FELT LIKE HE WAS SCREAMING INTO THE VOID TRYING TO GET CHINA IN THE WORLD TO LOOK AT HIM AND THE RESPONSE SILENCE HE WAS NO CLOSER TO GETTING HIS FAMILY BACK THAN HE WAS WHEN THEY LEFT HE TRIED MORE OFFICIAL ROUTS HE WENT TO THE CHINESE EMBASSY NOTHING ASKED THE CHURKISH GOVERNMENT FOR HELP WROTE TO THE UNITED NATIONS HE ONCE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PLAN TO MOVE TO CANDIDA AS A REFUGY TECAUSE HE THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT THERE WOULD HALF MORE LEVERAGE MIND YOU THAT WOULD TAKE YEARS TO COME TO FERWITION BUT HE TRULY BELIEVES THAT ONE DAY HIS FAMILY WILL BE TOGETHER AGAIN HE HAS THESE PICTURES ON HIS FOUM BECAUSE THERE'S NO PORTRAIT OF HIS FAMILY HE'S MADE SOME USING PASSPORT PHOTOS OF HIM IN PARIDA A BABY PICTURE HE HAS OF HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS GREENSHOT OF THAT VIDO OF ABDULAS EASE THERE PHOTO SHOPPED ON TO BACKGROUNDS THE CATHEODRAL OF NO TRDAM IN PARIS CHERRY BLOSSOMS IN JAPAN SO WHY

FOUND A CHILD HOOD FRIEND HE SAYS THEY HATCHED A PLAN TO BUY A PLAIN TICKET FOR HER TO GO BACK TO THEIR HOME TOWN GET EYES ON THE GROUND BUT OF COURSE EVEN WHEN SHE MADE IT ALL THE WAY THERE AND WAS SENDING HIM VIDIOS OF THEIR OLD NEIGHBORHOOD SHE STILL COULDN'T SPEK DIRECTLY TO WHAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY SEEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT EVERYTHING'S FIND SHE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING'S NEW AND BETTER AS SHE PANNED THE CAMERA AROUND THE EMPTY STREETS OBDE ROMOND WAS KICKED OFF WE CHAT SO WE DON'T HAVE THE ACTUAL VITIOS AND WE WEREN'T ABLE TO REACH HIS FRIEND WITHOUT RISKING HER SAFETY BUT HE SAYS THE WAY

LAT HIS FAMILY'S HOUSE IN THE CITY HAD BEEN DEMOLISHED THEY HAVE ANOTHER HALM A FARM THEY COULD HAVE MOVED THERE BUT THIS IS THE POINT WHEN OBDE ROMON STARTED TO WORRY THAT HIS PARENTS HAD BEEN TAKEN TO HE HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO THEM IN FOUR YEARS EVERY TIME HE GETS MORE INFORMATION IT'S LIKE THIS THE MORE HE LEARNS THE WORST THINGS SEEN OBDE ROMONS TOLL WATCH HIS TICKTOK IT'S LIKE A NERVOUS HABIT WHEN HE'S BORED AND HES TIRED AN INTERVIEWS WHEN IT TAKES TOO LONG FOR INTERPRETER TO TRANSLATE A QUESTION HE'LL SORT OF LEAN BAK AND POLISPHONE OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE EVENTUALLY IN JANUARY OF THIS YERE THE AP SHOOK LOOSE ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE WROTE TO HIM THROUGH TICTOX DIRECT MESSAGE IND FUNCTION THE MESSAGES START OFF NON CHALANTLY ENOUGH HIH HOW ARE YOU ROTHER OBDE ROMOND ASKED HIM IF HE'S SEEN HIS PARENTS LIGHTLY HOW ARE THEY DOING THE FRIEND DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HIS SON OR HIS WIFE BUT E COUL TELL OBDE ROMON THAT HIS FAMILY IN OXO IS GONE THEYRE NOT STAYING AT THEIR FARM LIKE HE HAD HOPED HIS ELDERLY FATHER HIS MOTHER WHO IS CANCER HE GIVES THEM NAME AFTER NAME THERE GONE THEYRE GONE TOO AND OBDE ROMON CAN'T EVEN BE SURE WHAT THIS MEANS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN FORCED OFF THEIR LAND BUT LIVING ELSEWHERE EY COULD BE DETAINED INTO RE EDUCATION SENTER THEY COULD BE IN PRISON FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT AS HE TELLING ME THIS IT'S THE DAY AFTER HE GOT THESE MESSAGES AND OBDE ROMON IS GETTING REALLY WORKED OUT HE'S TALKING SUPER SUPERFAST LIKE A DAN HAS BIRST AND ALL THESE EMOTIONS FROM THE PAST

LOOKING FOR HIS FAMILY AND PUT A WEAKER SPEAKER ON THE LINE TO TALK TO HIM MAYBE THEY'VE LEFT MAYBE THEY DID SOMETHING WRONG THE SPEAKER SAID BUT SHE REFUSED TO SAY IF THEY WERE ACCUSED OF A CRIME TWO DAYS AFTER HE GETS THE NEWS ABOUT HIS FAMILY HE FOUND SOMETHING NEW TO FIX IT ON THE MAYOR OF THIS STAMBLE HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE COULD CONVINCE THIS SKY TO HELP HIM HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT IN A WORD TO TURKISH DEPLOMATS WHO ELP PEOPLE THE TAINED OVERSEES THE MAYOR WAS SCEDUL TO SPEAK AT IN AFTERNOON EVENT IA DINNER IN HONOR OF THE DIFFERENT CULTURES OF THE TURKIC WORLD LIKE THE TURKS THAT OOS

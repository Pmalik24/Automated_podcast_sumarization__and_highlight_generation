YOUARE IF YOUARE DONAL TRUMP THEY WILL COME AFTER YOU WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH VARIOUS STATE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TEY WILL COME AFTER YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE BECOME AN ENEMY OF THE REGIME IN DONAL TRUMP SAID AND HE IS NOT IN CORRECT THAT FORT THIRTY FORTY YEARS HE WAS IN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC LIE ONE OF TOSE FAMOUS PEOPLE ON EARTH THERE WARE NO PROSECUTIONS AND THEN HE LEAVES THE PRESIDENCY AND BOOM WITHIN THREE YEARS THAT THERE ARE FOUR PROSECUTIONS ALL TO BE HITTING WITHIN AN ELECTION YEAR AN THAT LEAVES ASIDE THE CIVIL SUITS THAT OF ALL ARISEN IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT DOES MOSEIME LIKE A COINCIDENCE NOWY CAN ALWAYS ATTRIBUTE THAT TO HIS BEHAVIOR ON GENUARY SIX LARE BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND JANUARY BUT THE REALITY REMAINS THE DOMALTRUM HES PRETTY WILD AND CRAZY CHARACTER WELL BEFORE THAT NWHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE SUPPOSED FINANCIAL CRIMES THAT HE IS NOW BEING ACCUSED OF THOSE FINANCIAL ISSUES WERE WELL KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME YET HE NEVER FOUND HIMSELF IN THE DOCK HE NEVER FOUND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC THIS WAY WHILL ELON MUSK IS IN THE SAME BOAT NOW SA IN LAST MONTH THERE'VE BEEN TWO IN VESTIGATIONS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED IN TO COMPANIES RELATED TO ELON MUSK JUST LAST WEEK THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SUED SPACE ACTS FOR DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ASI LEAS AND REFUGEEES AN HIRING CLAIMING THAT SPASEX HAD TO HIER MORE PEOPLE WHO HAD CLAIMES ASYLUM TPEOPLEWHO CLAIMD REFUGE STATUS IN THE UNITED STATES DESPITE THE FACTHAT AS ELON MUSK CLAIMS SPASAX HAS NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRACTS THET MEANS THAT THEY HAVE VERY HIGH STANDARDS FOR SECURITY AND SO THEY WR SORT OF DAMNED IF THEY DID AN DAMNED IF THEY DIDN'T IF THEY  STARTED HIRING PEOPLE WHO ARE CLAMING ASYLUM OR REFUGE  STATUS HEND THEN IT TURNS OUT ON MOST PEOPLE ORE SECURITY RISK THEY COULD LOSE THEIR SECURITY CLARENCE AND PRESUMABLY HUNDREDS OF MILLINS O DOLLARS AND CONTRACTS AND IF IT DIDN'T HIRE THOSE PEOPLE THEN THE DO J WOULD SU THEM AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK AC CORDING TO ASSISTANTS TO TURNING GENERL CRISTON CLARK OF THE OJ CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION OUR IN VESTIGATION FOUND THAT SPACEXS FAILED THO FAIRLY CONSIDER OR HIER ASI LEASAND REFUGEES BECAUSE OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP STATUS TAN IMPOSED WHAT AMOUNTED TO A BAN ON THEIR HIE REGARDLESS OF THEIR QALIFICATION AND VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW OUR IN VESTIGATION ALSO FOUND THAT SPASEXS RECRUITERS AND HIGHLEVEL OFFICIALS TOOK ACTIONS THAT ACTIVELY DISCOURAGED O SILEAS AND REFUGEEES FROM SEEKING WORK OPPORTUNITIES AT THE COMPANY ASI LEASAND REFUGEEES HAVE OVERCOME MANY OBSTACLES IN THEIR LIVES AND ON LAWFUL EMPLOYMENT ISCRIMINATION BASED ON THEIR CITIZENSHIP STATI SHULD NOT BE ONE OF THEM SO THIS LOOKS LIKE A PUT UP JOBJS FROM THE OUTSETE LOILOK LIKE A PUT UP JOB DIRECTED AT ELON MUSK AND NOW ONE WEEK LATER WE ARE LEARNING THAT PROSECUTORS ARE NOW INVESTIGATING TESLA FOR USE OF FUNS ON A PROJECT DESCRIBED INTERNALLY AS A HOUSE FOR LE ELON MUSK ACCORDING TOTHE LOSSTR JOURNAL MAN HATTAN FEDERAL PROSCUTORS ARE INVESTIGATING TESTLAS USE OF COMPANY FUNS ON A SECRET PROJECT THAT HAD BEEN DESCRIBED INTERNALLY AS A HOUSE FOR ELON MUSK THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR ESTYON WHY HAS SOUGHT INFORMATION BOUT PERSONAL BENEFITS PAID TO MSK HOW MUCH TESLESS SPENSE ON THE PROJECT WHICH CALLED FOR A SPACIOUS GLASS STRUCTURE TO BE BUILT IN AUSTIN TEXAS AND WHAT IT WAS FOR THE WASTER JORNAL WAS THE FIRST REPORT INTUALY THAT TESSLEBOARD MEMBERS HAD INVESTIGATED WHETHER COMPANY RESOURCES WERE MISS USED ON THE SECRET EFFORT KNOWN INTERNALLY AS PROJECT FORTY TWO AND WETHER MUSKLASS PERSONALLY INVOLVED THE OUTCOME OF TESTLES INTERNAL INVESTIGATION CANNOT BE LEARNED THE ES C HAS ALSO OPEN A CIVIL INVESTIGATION INTO PROJECT FORTY TWO AND IS SEEKING SIMILAR INFORMATION FROM THE COMPANY ACCORDING TO ONE OF THOSE PEOPLES WELL HERE' THAT THING THE ESIAN WHY AND ES C INVESTIGATIONS THERE STILL IN THEIR EARLY STATIOS THEY MIGHT NOT LEAD TO FORMAL ALLEGATIONS OF WRONGDON YET MAGICALLY ALL THES FOUNITS WAY INTO THE NEWSPAPER WHY LOOK AT DAT ALL OF IT IS ON THE FRONTPAGE THE WOLSTER JOURNAL TO DAY TESLA DID NOT RESPONSE OREQUEST FOR COMMENTS ON THE STORY SPOKESMAN FOR THE ES C AND MANHATTN ES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO CLINEDTO COMMEN EMPLOYES WERE WORKING ON PROJECT FORTY TWO LAST YEAR PLANS CALLED FOR GLASS BUILDING TO BE ERECTED NEAR THE AUTOMAKERS AUSTIN AREA HEAD QUARTERS ATD ONE POINT THE BILDING WAS INVITION IN THE SHAPE OF A TWISTED HEXIGON OTHER IMAGES SHOWED AN EXPANS OF GLASS BOX THAT APPEARED TO INCLUDE A RESODUNCHAL AREA THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT AN WHETHER GLASS WAS EVER DELIVERED TESLAT COULD NOT BE LEARNED SO FEDERAL PROSCUTORS ARE NOU SEEKING INFORMATION ALSO ABOUT THE DRIVING RANGE OF TESLA'S ELECTRIC VEHICLES WROITERS IS REPORTING THAT  TESSLA HAD INFLATED THE PROJECTED DISTNS ITS VEHICLES COULD TRAVEL ON A SINGLE BATTERY CHARGE SO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ALL OF THE RE SOURCES OF THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITIES ARE BEING UNLEASED AT ULON MUSK NOW WHY IS THAT JUST A FEW YEARS GO ELON MUSK WAS EVERYBODY'S DARLING ELON MUSK HAD EARLY MARK' ZUKERBERG STATUS ELON MUSK LAS THE MOST CREATIVE MAN IN THE WORLD ONE OFTE GREAT INNOVATORS AND THEN HE BOUGHT TWITTER AND HEN IT TURNS OUT THAT HE HAS SORT OF RIGHTISH LIBERTARIAN POLITICAL LEANINGS AND THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED ELON MUSK STEPPED INTO THE HORNET'S NEST AND THE HORNET'S NEST IS NOW STINGING HIM THAT'S WHAT IT APPEARS LIKE TO ANYLON FROM THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE AGAIN NOTHING FOR YEARS WITH REGARD TO ELON MUSK AND THEN MAGICALLY THE YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTION TWO SEPARATE INVESTIGATIONS INTO EULON MUSKS COMPANIES WONIT'S BASEX WON IT TESSLA SO EITHER YOU BELIEVE THAT UON MUSK SUDDENLY STARTED BEING CORRUPT AND TERRIBLE OR YOU BELIEVE THAT THEI ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO SE LON MUS TAKIN OUT OR LEAS MINAMIZED IN TERMS OF HIS PUBLIC ABILITIES WHENT WHEN PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT ARE WORRIED ABOUT LAWFARE WHEN THEY ARE WORIEDABOUT THE MILITORIZATION OF LAW ENFORCEMEN RESOURCES THE D O J LOCAL ATTORNEY'S OFFICES AGAINST RIGHT WINGERS THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IN I'VE SET ON THE PROGRAM PUBLICLY FOR YEARS I OVERPAY MY TAXASA OVER PAY MY TAXIS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I SUSPECT THAT THIS IS ALWAYSBEN THE CASEON THAT IT WILL ALWAYS BE THE CASE THAT IF THERE SOME ONE IN POWER WHO DOESN'T LIKE YOU THERE'S ABSOLUTELY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY AN UBCOMING AFTER YOU THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT IT'S THE EXACTLY THE SORT OF ACTIVITY THAT DESTROYS ALL FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS IN F WE DON'T HAVE OUR INSTITUTIONS AN COMMON THEN WE CANNOT HAVE A FUNCTIONING SYSTEM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES NOWTHIS  BLEDING ITS WAY OVER NOT JUS FROM THE PRIVATE TEXCTOR TO THE PUBLIC SECTR LIKE ELON MUSKODONAL TRM MP BUT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HOW YOU VOKED LIKE ACTUAL ELECTION INTERFERENCSTWLL GET TO THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST IS YOURSELF ONE IN DIRO NEED OF REPLACEMENT YOU KNOW THE SIGNS GET THE SHORT BATTERY LIFE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHARGE R ON HANDALL THE TIME BRINK OUT A CRACK SCREEN THE GUTO GLASS

AGAINST PARTICULAR SIDES OF THE POLITICAL ISLE TAKE A LOK AND WHAT IS NOW BEING CONTEMPLATED WITH REGARD TO PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTIONS AND DONAL TRUMP ACCORDING TO THE MUR TIMES NEW HAMPSTURS FIRST IN THE NATION PRIMARY IS QUICKLY BECOMING THE LEADING EDGE FOR AN UNPROVEN LEGAL THEORY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DISQUALIFIED FROM A PURING ON THE BALLOT UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE US CONSTITUTION A LONG CHOK PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS FILED THE LAWSUIT IN STATE COURT SEEKING AN INJUNCTION TO KEEP TRUMP OFF THE BALLO A FORMAL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR SENTAT IS URGING THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO BRING A CASE THAT COULD PUT THE ISSUE BEFORE THE O SUPREME COURT ON WEDNESDAY FREE SPEECH FOR THE PEOPLE A LIBERAL LEANING GROUP THAT UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO STRIKE HOUSE REPUBLICANS FROM THE BALLOT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO SENT A LETTER TO SECRETARYES OF STATE IN NEW HAMPTURAS WHILES FLORTIN TO MEXCO OHIO IN WIS CONSIN URGING THEM TO BAR TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT UNDER THE FORTEENTH MENMENT THO OUTFORTAR IM PLOYING A THEORY THAT HAS BEEN GETTING TRACTION AMONG LIBERALS AND ANT HA TFROM CONSERVATIVES THAT TRUMPS ACTIONS ON GANUARY SIXTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TISQUALIFY HIM UNDER SECTION THREE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH PARS PEOPLE FROM HOLDING OFFICE IF THEY TOK AN OATH TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION AND THEN LATER QUOT ENGAGED AN INSURRECTION OR REBELLION AGAINST THE SAME WELL NORMALLY YOU'D HAVE THAVE LIKE A CONVICTION FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ORSAY YOU SWORN OATH TO A FORN POWER LIKE THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA RIGHT THAT MIGHT BE GOOD EVIDENCE THAT YOU SHULD BE BARRED FROM HE BALLOT THAT'S LITERALLY WHY THE LALL WAS WRITTEN THAT'S WHY SECTION THRE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EXISTS YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T EXIST TO DO A LAST SECRETARYES OF STATE TO SIMPLY TO CLAR SOMEBODY AN ENEMY OF THE REPUBLIC AND THEN BAR HIM FROM THE BALLOT ACCORDING TO THE YOR TIMES THE THEORY AS BEEN GETTIG LOMENTUM SINCE SUPROMINENT CONSERVATIVE LAW PROFESSORS PUBLISH AN ARTICLE THIS MONTH CONCLUDING TRUMPETS CONSTITUTIONALLY DIS QUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR OFFICE WELL THE LEFT WHISCH IS TO APPEAL TIS OLTOWAY TO THUPREME COURT WHY BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT RULES IN FROM FAVOR THEN THEY WILL JISTCLAIM THAT THE SUPREME CORT IS STACKED ON BEHALF OF DONAL TRUMP UNDER MY NING THE CREDIBILITY OF THAT INSTITUTION AND AGAIN THIS IS NOW BEING CONSIDERED BY MULTIRAL SECRETARIES OF STATE NOT JUST IN THE PRIMARIES BHUN THE GENERAL ELECTION AS WELL ACCORDING TO NATIONAL REVIEW A RECENT ARTICL PUBLISH IN THE PENSYLVANIA LAWE OF YIOU FROM THE FEDERALOS SOCIETIES WILLIAM BOWED AND MICHAEL STOKES PALSON ARGUES THAT TRUMP HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FROM ACCIS TO THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT RE BASED ON THEIR READING OF THE FOURTEEN THE MENDMEN THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THEIR THEORY IS SELF EXECUTING BY WHICH THEY MANUA SELECTION OFFICIALS DON'T NEED TO SEE PERMISSION OR SPECIAL AUTHORITY TO BAR TRUM FROM THE BALLAD INDEED THEIR OATHS OBLIGE THEM NOT TO  SO DONAL TRUM MAD THE CASE THAT MIGTPENSE COULD UNILATERALLY DISQUALIFIE STATES CERTIFIED STATE VOTES IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ELECTION TNOUS A SPECIOUS THEORY THIS THEORY IS THAT SECRETARIES OF STATE CAN SIMPLY DESIDE WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE POINT WITHOUT ANY LEGAL CASE WITHOUT ANY ACTUAL CONVICTION BITHOUT ANY CHARGES BEING FILED THEORETICALLY THAT SOMEBODY HAS VIOLATED THIS ELEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THEREFORE CAN BE BARRED CONSTITUTIONALLY FROM APPEARING ON THE BALLAT THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY STUFF OBVIOUSLY N YOU ARNT TUG ABOUT UNDERMINDING FAITH AN ELECTIONS THIS WOULD DO IT YOU ON  CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS HAVE OT WHEN A SECRETARY OF STATE INSATE ARIZONA TESIDES THAT DONAL TRUMP CANNOT BE ON THE BALLAT AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE SUPREME COURT AND THEN THESRIMCOURT STRIKES THAT DOWN THAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS BECAUSE OF THAT POINT YOU HAVE A STATE ACTING WITHIN ITS OWN PERVIEW BUT VIOLATING BASIC PRECEPTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER THEING STRUCK DOWN BY SUPREME COURT ON WHICH THREE MEMBERS WERE APPOINTED BY THE PERSON WHO'S AT ISSUE THE LEFT WILL CLAIM THAT IT'S LAWFARE THE RIGHTWILL CLAIM THAT IT'S LAWFARE MEAN THIS IS WHERE WE ARE HEADED IT'S REALLY REALLY UGLY AND S WHAT WE NOW HAVE IS A BIZAR SITUATION IN WHICH THE LEFT CLAIMS THAT BECUSES THE RIGHT IS CUONQUANT INSURRECTIONARY THEY CAN USE THE LAW IN EXTRA LEGAL WAYS THAT'S WHAT'S EFFECTIVELY HAPPENING RIGHT HERE THIS IS WHY THE USE OF THE LAWTS GLUFTER TRUMP OVER A BUNCH OF NONSENSE INTAY MANHATTON IS SO DEVASTATING TO RULE OF LAW A POLITICO TODAY HAS THE NEW YORK A G CLAIMING THAT DONAL TRUMP FRAUDULENTLY IN FLATED HIS NOTWORTH BY AS MUCH AS TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR THE NEW ESTIMATES CAME IN FILINGS FROM THE YORK STATE ATTURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE WHICH IS SUING TRUMP SOME OF HIS ADULT CHILDREN AND HIS BUSINESS EMPIRE FOR FALSIFYING HIS NOT WORTH IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN AT FAVORABLE TERMS FROM BANKS AND ANSURANCE COMPANY THAT TRIAL IS SAID TO BE IN ON OCTOBER SECOND NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS HERE IS THAT NONE OF THOSE COMPANY IS ARE ACTUALLY SUING TRUMP IS A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION THAT ARE A CIVIL TRIAL THAT IS BEING BROUGHT TO BEARE BY THE STATE ON BEHALF IN TURNS COMPANIES WHO AREN'T SUING HIM AGAIN LAWFARE BEING USED TO GO AFTER DONAL TRUMP AND WHAT YOURE GETTING HERE IS A SELF PERPETUATING CYCLE WHERE THE LEFT SEESE THE RIGHT AS SO INHERENTLY EVIL AND DANGEROUS AN INSURRECTIONIST THEN WE MUST USE THE LEGAL ABILITIES THAT AURE DISPOSAL TO GO AFTER THEM WE MUST USE THE GEOCATED GLUF FOR ELAN MUSK THAT'S A DANGEROUS CHARACTER THAT O MAGHT ALOW THINGS ON WOTER THAT WE DON'T LIKE AN IF THOSE THINGS ARE ALLOWED ON TWITTER THEN DONAL TRUMP MIGHT WIN AN ELECTION OR DOBIDE MIGHT LOSE AN ELECTION SO WE BETTER USE WHATEVER LEGAL METHODS WE HAVEAT OUR DISPOSAL TO GO AFTER BACKEYE DONAL TRUMP SUPERDANGEROUS THAT MEANS HATWE HAVE TO AC TIVATES SECRETARIES OF STATE TO DO THINGS THATARE PRETTY ILLEGAL BUT THEY HAVE  SORT OF THE PETTINA OF LEGALITY TO THEM IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH WHT WE WAW AND E WE REALLY REALLY HATE DONAL TRUPS OR ONE ONE THNGS WE HAVE TO DO AS WE HAVE TO GO AFTER IM ON SPEECIOUS BULLCRAP CHARGES IN NEW YORK ITS IT'S IT'S MORALLY MANDATED BECAUSE THE RIGHT IS SO DANGEROUS AND SO REACTIONARY AND SO INSURRECTIONISS AND THE NATURAL RESPONDS FROM THE RIGHT IS WELL OCASO YOURE DOING EXTRA LEGAL THINGS WITH THE LAW WHICH MEANS THEY ARE ACTING ILLEGALLY WHICH JUSTIFIES US IN GOING OUTSIDE THE LAW TO DO THINGS A MEAN EVERY REVOLUTION STARTS OF THE CLAIM THAT THE POWER IS THAT BE ARET ENGAGING EXTRA LEGAL ACTIVITY UNDER COLOR OF LAW IT THERE'S EVERY REVOLUTION NOW I'M NOT CALLING FOR THAT REVOLUTION I THINK THAT THERE IS A A WEAPONS DOWN HERE BUT THIS IS WHAT WE ARE QUICKLY SPIRALING TOARDS WEARE QUICKLY SPIRELING TOWARDS TE BELIEF ON THE PART OF THE RIGHT THAT THE LEFT HIS MILI TORISE THE ENTIRE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS THE LOT OF LOCAL JUSTICSE DEPARTMENTS  SECRETARIES OF STATES OFFICS AN ALL THE REST AGAINST THE RIGHTS AND THEREFORE THE RIGHT IS JUSTIFIED IN DOING WHATEVER IT CAN TO STOP THAT AND THEN THE LEFT LOOKS AT THAT THEY SAY WHAT AR YOU GOTS DOHN YOU DOING ALL THE STUFF THAT'S EXTRA LEGAL ELL THAT JUSTIFIES US IN STOPPING YOU NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES WITH OR WITHOUT THE LAW IT'S A SELF PERPETUATING CYCL AND THE'S SOMETHING EVEN WORSE ABOUT THIS WHICH IS THAT  THE POSITIONS REVERSE THEMSELVES DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE ILL GET TO THAT IN  JUST ONE SECOND FIRST EVERBODY KNOWS IT LET MY HELIK SLEEP MATTRESS IS YOUKNOW THAT JUST LAUNCH THEIR NEWEST MOST HIGH IND COLLECTION HE LICK SO LEET I GOT TPE I'DN'T APRECIATE MY HELIK SLEEP MATTRESS E NOUGH AND I PRECHAT A LOT UNTIL LAST NIGHT'S LAST NIGHT MI DAUGHTER CAME DOWN WHO ONT OFTHREE FEVER WHICH MEN IS SLEEPING IN HER ROOM OU NOUT I COULDN'T TAKE WITH ME MY HELICK SLEEP MATTRESS AS ITS IN MY ROOM SUNE THAT I WAS ON THE FLOOW ON A YOGA MAT SLEEPING NEXT TO MY DAUGHTER TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS OKA LET ME TELL A NOT A GREAT SLEEP QUALITY HELICK'S MATTRES YOU NEED IT IT'S GREAT HELIC'S ELET INCLUDES SIX DIFFERENT MATTRESS MODELS EACH KILOR FOR SPECIFIC SLEEP POSITIONS AND FROM TIS PREFERENCES I'VE HAD MY HELICK'S MATTRESS FOR SEVEN EIGHT YEARS THIS POINT IT IS GREAT IF YOU NERVOUS ABOUT BUYING MATRES ON MON YONT HAVE TO BE HELIKS HAS A SLEEP QUITS THAT MATTRES YOUR BODY TYPE AND SLEEP PREFERENCES TO THE PERFECT MATTRESS WHY WOULD YOU BUY MATTRESS MADE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE I TOK TAT HELICKS QUIS OUS MATT OR THE FIRM BUT BREATHABLE MATTRESS GO TO HELIC'S SLEEP DOT COMSLESH MEN TAKE TER TO MEN UTE SLEEP

PARTNER TWENTY FIVE IT'S THE BEST OFFER YET HE WON'T LAST LONG WITH HELICK'S BETTER SLEEP STARTS RIGHT NOW OGAY SO WHEN I SAY THE SITUATIONS CAN REVERSES I MEAN THAT THE NATURAL DYNAMIC RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE LEFT BECAUSE IT'S IN CONTROLL OF THE LAW I'S USING THE LAW IS A WEAPON AND THE RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN CONTROL OF THE LAW IS BUCKING THE LAW RIGHT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE GENERALIZED PERCEPTION ET'S YOU FEED ON EACH OTHER THE RGHT IS BUCKING THE LOSS LEFTS AS WE HAVE TO USE THE LAW ANDTHEN THE RGHTS AS LEFT IS USING THE LOSS WE HAVE TO BUCK THE LAW SUCH A COMPLETE CYCL BUT HERE IS THE THING HERE'S T W YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST A BATTLE OVER INSTITUTIONAL CREDIBILITY SO AT THE LEFT WANTS TO SAY IS THE RIGHT THEY'RE NOT THE'RE NOT BEING EXTRA LEGAL BECAUSE WE'RE MISUSING THE LAW THEY'RE BEING EXTRA LEGAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LAW THEY'RE BEN EXTRA LEGAL BECAUSE THE LAW DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM AT ALL THE LAWS THE INSTITUTIONS THAT THEY WANTO TEAR DOWN THE INSTITUTIONS THEY ARE THE ONES ARE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES IN AMERICAN LIFE WE ARE HERE STANDING FOR THE INSTITUTIONS BUT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE WHEN THE LEFT IS NOT IN CONTROL OF ILLEGAL BODY THEY ATTACK THE LEGAL BODY WITH JUST AS MUCH LACRITY AS THEY WEREDEFENDING IT LITERALLY ONE SECOND AGO SO FOR EXAMPLE DONAL TRUMP YESTERDAY HE WAS ON WITH EBLY GLEN BACK AND THAT YEU WAS ASKE ABOUT PROSCUING DEMOCRATS IS PRESIDENT AND HE SAID WELL YAH I MEAN THEIR PROSECUTING ME HERE'S WHAT A TOWN LIKE YOU SAID IN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN  YOU KNOW A LOCKER UP AND THEN WHEN YOU BECAME PRESENET YOU SAID WE DON'T DO THAT IN AMERICA THAT'S JUS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING DO YOU REGRET NOT LOCKING HER UP AND IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT AGAIN WILL YOU LOCK PEOPLE LUP WE GI INEXAMPLE I THE  AV E E I E DOING IT AT I ALWAYS HAT E E EEEE OEI THE PRESIDENT E PRESIDENTTE AND AT TAT THE OFTI E TE PRESIDENT AND I NEVER I I E HARTE I CULD HAVE AND EN I EU A ON T E AND  WIT HIM THAT WIS DOING IT YE I DON'T THINK  YOT TA TE THINK ABOUT MUCH OGAY SO THE ENTIRE LEFT WHEN INSANE TONAL TRUMP PLEDGING TO LOCK UP HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND HE NOWD BE CRAZY IF YEU WINS THE OFFICE ANDTEN HE USES THE GOJAIS WHO WEAPONIZED THE OJA AGAINST HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS THAT'S JUST TERRIBLE THAT'S UNTHINKABLE AND WE'D HAVE TO RESORT TO EXTRA LEGAL MEANS TO STOP ALL OF THAT WE'D HAVE TO DO SOMEOUT IN THE STREET TO MAN RIOTS WE'D HAVE TO STOP THAT THING BECAUSE THE TYRANT WOULD BE TAKING OVER TWHAT HE EXACTLY DO YOU THINK THAT THE WRIGHT IS ARGUING RIGHT NOW ABOUT YOBIDEN AND HIS MERI AND MERICARLANDS DEOJAG THEY'E CONING SWEETHEART DEALS WITH JOBIDAN SON SWEET ARDEALS THAT ARE SO SWEETHARDISH THAT HE JUDGE LITERALLY SAW IT BLANCHED AND WAS LIKE NOTE NOT INTERESTED ANDTHEYHAD TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD  MEANWHILE THEY'RE GOING AFTER TRUMP FOR EVERY JOT AND TENTL INCLUDING CHARGES THE DON'T EVEN FIT WHEN IT COMES O THE GANUOR SIXTH CASE THEY'R LETTING HILLERY CLITTENOUGHSGOT FREE BUT THEY'RE GOING AFTER NONAL TRUMP AND SO LAN FORCEMEN IS GOOD RIGHT NOW FOR THE LEFT BUT IF DON TRUMP TAKES OVER LAWNFORCEMENT IMMEDIATELY COMES BAD THE GEOJA TURNS INTO A WEAPONIZED EVIL LAW INFORCEMENT THAN MUST BE BUCKE IT EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND THEN THE POSITIONS REVERSE THEN IT'S THE LEFT THITS INSURRECTIONIST AGAINST THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE RGHT THAT'S DEFENDING THE INSTITUTIONS AS AS VIABLE AND DURABLE AND NECESSARY YEU CAN SEE IT TO DAY AN POLITICO ENTIRE OPINION PIECE FROM ERRAND TANG A LAW PROFESSOR A YOU SE DAVIS AND A FORMER LAWCLERK TO SONIA SO TO MAYOR YAS A BESTITTLE THE SUPREME COURT IS INFECTED WITH THE MOST DAMAGING HUMAN BYUS HE SAYS THE BIGGEST PROB IT THE PARTISANSHIP DIGNOSIST IS THAT THE SPRIMCOURT HAS ALWAYSBEEN PART OF THE POLITICS NOT ABOUT IT MOST IMPORTANT YO'VE JUSTICE IN OUR HISTORY JOHN MARSHAL IS A FEDERALIS PARTY OPERATIVE THESE HISTORICAL PERIODS O JUST THAT IF PARTISANSHIP ALONE WERE ENOUGH TO TORPEDO PUBLIC LEGITIMACY THE SUPREME COURT NEVER WOULD HAVE RISENS WOIS PROMINENT PLACE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY WHAT REALLY IS DIFFERENT AND DANGEROUS ABOUT TODAY'S JUSTICE IT'S NOT PARTISANSHIP BHE RATHER A COGNANT OF TRAP THEN NOBELL PRIZEWENNINGPSYCHOLOGIST DANUEL CONMEN IS CALLED THE MOST DAMAGING OF ALL HUMAN BIACES OVER CONFIDENCE PUT SIMPLY TO DAY'S JUSTICE IS POSSESS A FRIGHTENING DEGREE OF CERTAINTY THEY ALONE CAN ANSWER SOCIETY'S MOST PRESSING PROBS WITH JUST THE RIGHT LAOWYELLY ARGUMENTS OR NOW YOU HAVE THE LEFT THAN ON ARGUMENT TAT THE RIGHT ALWAYS MADE FOR GENERATIONS THE ARUMENT THE RIGHT MADE WAS WHO GAVE THE SUPREME COURT THE POWER TO SIMPLY DECLARE ABORTION ON DEMAND THE LAW OF THE LAND WHO GIVE HEM THE POWER TO DO THAT WHO GIVE THE SUPREME COURT THE POWER TO SIMPLY DECLARE THAT GAME MARRIAGE WAS THE LAW OF THE LAND AN SHRINE IN THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION WHO GAVE THEM THE POWER TO DO THAT THEY REN OVERED HIM THAT POWER NOW THE LEFT IS MAKING EXACTLY THE SAME ARGUMENTS TABOUT THE PEOPLE WE'RE ON THE SPRIME COURT NOW NOW LEVE CLAIM THAT THIS WAS UNDERMINDING LEGITIMACY THE UPREME COURT THAT IF YOU IF YOU SAID ROVERSUUATED IN ILLEGITIMATE DECITION BECAUSE IT IS IF YOU SAID THAT BASE NOT ON YOUR DIS RESPECT FOR THE COURT ROUND YOUR RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IF YOU SAID THAT THEY CLAIMED YOUR BASICALLY AN INSURRECTIONIST YOU'RE TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE THE LEGITIMACY OF THESUPRIME COURT AND UNDERMINE IT'S CREDIBILITY THEN THE CONSTITUENTS Y OF THE COURT SHIFTS AND THE THE POSITIONS ENTIRELY FLIP THEY ENTIRELY FLIP SO WHAT IS THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT BASICALLY THE ONLY THNG THAT MATTERS IS WHO CONTROLS THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS IT'S ALL JUST A POWER GANE IT'SALL JUST TA PAWRGAN NOW THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS TERRITORY IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS TERRITORY BECAUSE WHAT IT SUGGESTS ITS THAT IF YOU LOSE AN ELECTION AD IF THE ONLY THING THET MATTERS IT'S WHO CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT YOU AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE THE INSTITUTION IS ILLEGITIMATEIF THE OTHER PARTY CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE ANY INSTITUTIONS IN COMMON AND IT'S ONLY A QUESTION OF HOW BADLY SOME ONE' TO OXGETEDS GORD BEFORE THINGSTART TO GET REALLY BLOODY AND UGLY AND VIOLENT IT'S A SYRIOUS PROBAINS HAPPENING BY THE WAY ALL CROSS THE LEST IS NOT UNIQUE TO THE UNITED STATES IN WESTERN COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE IS NOW A FEELING THAT'S ARISING THAT BECAUSE THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE FAILED HOR BECAUSE THE INSTITUTIONS ARE WEAPONIZED BY YOUR POLITICAL OPPOSITION THE YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AND TH NDIS TAT BY THE WIGHT THIT'S NOT A RIGHT LEFT THING BECAUSE THE LEFT WILL DO THE SAME THING AS THE RIGHT IF THEY ARE OUT OF POWER WHEN THE RIGHT IS OUT WHEN THE RIGHT IS IN POWER IN BRAZIL IT'S TYRANNY AFOOT AND INSURRECTION IN THE STREETS IS THE ONLY THING CAN STOP YEATERABLES ANARROW AND WHEN IT IS LULA TE SOLVA IN POWER AND HE'S ACTIVELY USING THE SUPREME COURT AS HIS TOOL AND AND BREAKING THE RULE OF LAW THERE THEN IT'S THE RORS THEE THE RGHT TO SAING ITS AN INSURRECTION THE WE HAVE TO BE IN THE STRAIGTS AN WOEU ROUN OF A CHOICE ONCE EVERY ELECTION BECOMES A MATTER OF TYRANNY VERSAS LIBERTY AND THERE'S NO CLEAR DEFINITION OF THESE THINGS THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET VERY VERY UGLY THE FIGHT OVER INSTITUTIONS AS IT TURNS OUT IS NOT OVER ABOUT INSTITUTIONAL CREDIBILITY NO ONE RESPECTS THE INSTITUTIONS RIGHT ONCE THE INSTITUTION IS ONLY GOOD IF YOU'RE ONE IN CONTROLL OF IT IT'S NOT A GOD INSTITUTION ANY MORE IF THE POLICE ARE ONLY GOOD IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE IN THE POLICE AND F SOMEBODY DON'T KNOW IN THE POLICE THE POLICE ARE BAD NOW THEN YOU DON'T RESPECT THE POLICE QUA POLICE JUST RESPECT YOUR FRIENDS IF YOU'RERESPECT FOR THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS RELIONT ON IT BEING STAFF BY PEOPLE W'LL GREE WITH YOU WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS THAT THE PEOPLEWHO DISAGREE WITH YOU ARE SO DANGEROUS AND SO OUT OF BOUNDS THAT THE INSTITUTION BECOMES FUNDAMENTALLY ILLEGITIMATE BECAUSE IT IS STAFF BY THOSE PEOPLE WHICH MEANS WE DO'T AVE A PROME WITH INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES WEVER PROM WITH EACH OTHER NOW IRN'NI SHOUL BELIEVE THAT AMERICANS RIT LARGE HAV PROM WITH EACH OTHER I THINK THE ELEETS REALLY OFE A PROM WITH EACH OTHER AND I THIK THE'RE WEAPONIZING INSTITUTIONS AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR FUN AND PROFIT I THING YOU GO EVERY DAY AMERICA AND MOST AMERICANS THEY DO'T CABOUT THE STUFF THID JUST ONE A LIKE GO ABOUT THEIR DAILY BUSINESS BE LEFT ALONE RAISE THEIR FAMILIES GO TO CHURCH  GO TO TEIR WORK THAT'S ABOUT IT BUT THEY'RE PEOPLE AT THE TOP WHE HAVE A REAL INTEREST INS IT IN IN ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT IF THEY L IF YOUR SIDE LOSES THE COUNTRY IS IRREVOCABLY BROKEN AND THERE WE'LL NOT BE FOR EXAMPLE ANOTHER ELECTION AND BY THE WAY IT'S BOTE THE RIGHT LEFT SANGTHES WE GOING ON THE NESTUCIONS LIKHELYUHAVE THE RIGHT SAYING THAT IF JOBINE WINDSRY ELECTION THE COUNTRYES OVER AND YOUHAVE THE LEFT SAYING THAT IF DON TRUMPLINDS RE ELECTION THE OUNTRY IS OVER THAT IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE IN A SECOND OWN GET INTO WHAT THIS WHAT THIS SORT OF MEANS HOW WE CAN HOW CAN WE GET OUT OF THIS CONNUNDRUM THIS SORT PUZZLE WE'VE CRINTED FOR OURSELVES FIRST WENT WHEN YOU BUY A HOUSE YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSE YOU TRY TO FIX SOME THINGS UP BOUD AND N PAINT JOB FIX THE DOORS WHATEVER BUT THERE'S SOMETHING OU POBLY NONTHING ABOUT ALL THAT MUCH AN THAT'S THE STUFF COVERING THE WINDOWS AN MEN THAT' SUSS BEEN THE FOREVER WOULD  BUT HOW LIGHT FLOWS INTO A HOUSE IS A HUGE THING NATURAL LIGHT IS ONEOF THE REASONS THAT WE BOUGHT OUR HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE ITE ALSO MEANT THAT WE WANTED TO UP GRADE THE WINDOW COVERINGSAND THIS WY WE HAD IT ON OVER TO BLINDSTOCK COM BLINDSTOT COME IS THE UMBER ONE ON MINE RETAILOR OF CUSTOM WINDOW COVERINGS WITH OVER FORTY THOUSAND FIVE STARE OF VIEUS OU CAN MEASURE AN IN STULLIT YOURSELF OR HAVE BLINSTOCK COME TAKE CARE OF IT WITH LOCAL PROFESSIONALS THERE'S DNO SHOW ROOM NO RETELL MARKETS NO MATER HOW MANY ORDER INSTELLATIONS JUST ONE LOW COST IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN IFOR DEZIGN BLINDSTOCK COME EXPERTS ARE ALWAYS VAILABLE TO HELP CHOOSE THE STYLE AND COLOR RIGHT FOR YOU EVERYTHING THEY SELL IS COVERED BY THE PERFECT FIT AND ONE HUNDRED PER CENT  SATIS FACTION GARANTEE WITH HUNDREDS OF STOLES AND COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM BLINDSTOCK COM MI SURE TO HAVE THE PERFECT TRATMENT FOR YOUR WINDOWS GET UP TO FIFTY PER CENT OFF PLUS DOOR BUSTERS AT BLINDSTOCK COMMS LABERTAY SAIL IT'S THEIR BIGGAST SALEVER SO TO FIFTY PER CENT RIGHT NOW A BLINDSTOCK COMMWENY CHECK OUT ON LINET DON'T FORGETS TELLING YOU HERD ABOUT BLINDSTOT COM FROM THE BENSHIP YEROSHO RULES AND RESTRICTIONS MAY UPPLY HAYSO WHAT IS THIS MEAN WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF TE UNITED STATES LOOK LIKE WHA FIRST WE HAVE TO FIX THE SOCIAL FABRIC IF WE DON'T FIX THE SOCIAL FABRIC THE INSTITUTIONS ARE RRELEVENT SO INSTITUTIONS ARE USUALLY ONLY EFFECTIVE IF THEY GOVERN WITH LIGHTHAND WHEN THE SOCIAL FABRIC FAILS INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO COME IN WITH A HEAVIER HAND AND THEN THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT IT ANDTHE PEOPLE GET ANGRY T EACH OTHER AND THEY BLAME THE INSTITUTIONS FOR THE ACTUAL FAILURE OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC  GENERALLY INSTITUTIONS GET TYRANY GROWS AS SOCIAL FABRIC FAILS FOR TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE THE PLACE FOR SOCIAL FABRIC IS THE IS THE MOST DURABLE THE TIGHTIST IS BETWEEN YOU AN THE OTHER MEMBERS YOUR FAMILYT YOU GENERALLY DON'T NEED A THIRD PARTY ARBER AR COMING IN AND IS JUDICATING FIGHTS BETEN YOU MEMBERS INFACT YOU RESENT IT IF A THIRD PARTY ARBORER COMES IN AN SARTS MESSING AROUND IN YOUR FAMILIES BUSINESS WHY AS THE SOCIAL FAB RIC IS TIGHT WELL IF THINGS START TO FALL APART THAT'SWHEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE OR PROTECTIVE SERVICES SHOW UP OR DIVORCE LAWYER SHOW UP AND THINGS ARE TO GET REALLY UGLY AND THE MORE THEIRE INVOLVE THE UGLIER THEY GET NOW THAT'S TRUE ON A SOCITA LEVEL IS WELL AS WE FAILED TO GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER ORE AS WE FELT TO RESPECT EACH OTHER AS HUMAN BEINGS WE START CALLING IN THE BIG GUYS TO COME IN IN IN FORCE AURE OPINION WITH THE GUN THIS IS WHY AS SOCIETIES FAIL INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO GET MORE AND MORE TYRRANNICAL THEY DON'T REALLY AVE IC CHOICE THERE TWO WAYS THAT SOCIETIES GO SOUTH WITH REGARD TO SOCIETIES AN INSTITUTION IND THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIP ONE IS THE WAY THAT I JUST DESCRIBED THE SOCIAL FABRIC DECAYS AND THEN THE INSTITUTIONS FOLLOW YOU MAKEN'T ARGUMENT THAT THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT'S HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WITH THE RISE OF A RADICAL LEFT THAT OVERTHROW THE SOCIAL COMPACT THAN INSTEAD OF SAYING WE REQUIRED CHANGE WITH IN THAT BOUNDARIES OF THE SOCIAL COMPACTS HAVE TE ENTIRE SOCIAL COMPACT IS CORRUPT AND EVIL AND NASTY AND A GUISE FOR POWER WE HAVE TO THROW IT OUT THAT IT WAS NO LONGER A FIGHT BETWEEN J F CAY LIBERALS AND NEONIAN CAN SERVATIVES THAT NOW THE FIGHT WAS BETWEEN REVOLUTIONARIES THOUGHT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AS CORRUPT THAT ER BERMARCU'S ARGUMENT THEY T THE BASIC ITDEA THAT ALL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHERE ACTULLY GUISES FOR POWER THAT ONCE THAT CORRUPTED ARE INSTITUTIONS AND TOOK A COUPLE GENERATIONS TO DO IT ONCE THOSE CINFUSE THROUGHOUT OUR INSTITUTIONS THEN THE FAILURES OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC WERE MADE MANIFEST PEOPLE STOP GOING TO CHURCH WHICH WAS THAY SOCIAL FABRIC BUILDER  PEOPLE STOPPED BELIEVING ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR ARGUMENTS THEIR ARGUMENTS THEY STARTED TO THINK WHERE ACTUALLY JUST AN EXCUSE FOR YOU TO DO THE THING YOU WANTO DO ANYWAY AD WHEN YOU'D HAVE A GOOD FAITH ARGUMEN TERE'S NO SUCH THING AS GOOD FAITH ARGUMEN ANY MORE IT WAS BASELY JUST ACCUSATIONS ONCE THAT STUFF MADE ITS WAPE TO THE INSTITUTIONS OF COURSE THE INSTITUTIONS FAILS THAT'S ONE WAY THAT SOCIETIES FAIL THAT INSTITUTIONS FAIL AFTER SOCIETIES THERE IS ONE OTHER WAY AND IT'S POSSIBLE THIS ALSO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT IS THAT INSTITUTIONS CAN CAUSE  SOCIAL FABRIC TO DECAY HOW DO INSTITUTIONS CAUSE SOCIAL FABRIC TO DECAY WELL WHAT WHAT HAPPENS THE LEATS IN A SOCIETY GAIN CONTROL OF AN INSTITUTION AND THEY DECIDE IT IS TIME FOR WORLD BREAKING CHANGE THEY HAVE TO CENTRALIZE POWER THAT POWER IS NOW GOING TO BE USED IN TOP DOWN FASHION IN ORDER TO CROWD OUT THE SOCIAL FABRIC BECAUSE PEOPLE NED TO CHANGE AND THE CURREN SOCIAL FABRIC THAT'S CREATED FLAUD PEOPLE EGET RID O THAT SOCIAL FABRIC CREATE WE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE PEOPLE WILL FLOURISH AND FLOWER ANEW THAT SORT OF THE CASE THAT MARKS ISM MAKES IS THAT PEOPLE ARE PETTY AND NASTY TO ONE ANOTHER BUT IF WE LIVE IN A MARKS IS UTOPIA PEOPLE BE ASSUMS ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS CHANGED THE SUPERSTRUCTURE AND SUDENLY THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES CHANGE SO INSTITUTIONS  CAPTURED BYT ELEATS START TO TRY TO CRAM DOWN CHANGE ON PEOPLE AT THE TOP LEVEL AND IN DOING SO THEY MUST BREAK DOWN THE SOCIAL FABRIC IT IS NECESSARY TBECAUSE THE SOCIAL FABRIC ARE LITTLE PLATOONS AGAINST THAT AS HAT BEEN BORK DESCRIBE THEM NOW N A GOOD FUNCTIONING SOCIETY USES THE SOCIAL FABRIC AND AND THE LITTLE PLATOONS WITHIN THT SOCIAL FABRIC AS THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR A BROADER SOCIETY A TERRIBLE SOCIETY MUST IN YOU TOPIAN FASHION DESTROY ALL THOSE BUILDING BLOCKS LEVEL THE EARTH AND THEN BUILD WITH WHATEVER IS LEFT AND THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT YOU CAN MAKE ARGUMENT HAPPEN WITH AMERICAN INSTITUTION PARTICULAR IN THE SIXTIES THE GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVELY CROWDED OUT RELIGION IT EFFECTIVELY CROWDED OUT THE SOCIAL FABRIC IT IT CROWDED OUT ALL F THE CONNECTIONS TAT YOU AVE WITH YOUR FRIENDS ANNOUCE ALL BEEN FILLED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND SO THEN THE SOCIAL FABRIC FAILS AND THEN THE CALL FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS WHALE THE SOCIAL FABRIC FAILING WE NEED MORE GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENTE FAILS AT THAT BUT T STILL CROWD OUT THEF SOCIAL FABRIC AND OUT ALL ALL FAITH IN INSTITUTIONS IS LOST WHICHOVER THOSE ARGUMENTS YOU ACCEPT ONE THING IS FOR CIAR TRUE IF WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS NOT A FAILURE OF INSTITUTIONS PREDOMINANTLY BUT A FAILURE OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC THIS CAN ONLY BE FIXED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH THE REBUILDING OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS THAT W WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE FIGHTING FOR AN IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WHEN YOU DISCUSS THIS WITH RATIONAL MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE POLITICAL PARTY MANY OF THEM WILL AGREE I HAVE THIS CONVERSATION OPEN WITH ANICASPARIAN FROM THE UNTURKS FOR EXAMPLE AND I GOT HER TO AGREE INS ARE BROAD STROKES THET WHA WE REALLY NEED TO DO WIT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MINIMIZE IT THET WHEN YOU HAE AE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT INSTITUTIONALL IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND EVERYBODY'S JUST FIGHTING OVER THE POWER IN ORDER TO USE IT AGAINST THEIR PO LITICAL OPPONENTS THIS EXASFORMATES THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO BE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE WHAT YOU CAN'T DO IS MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE BEST FORM OF AMERICAN INSTITUTION MAKING IS GOING TO BE DONE AT THE TOP LEVEL BECAUSE IT ISN'T IT ISN'T BY THE WAY THE FOUNDERS UNDERSTOOD THIS WHICH IS WHY THEY MADE THE FEDERAL GVERNMENT REALLY WEAK COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING THE FEDERL GOVERNMENT WAS VERY VERY WEAK NOT JUST EVEN EVEN AFTER THE TRANSFORMATION FROM THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATIONS THE CONSTITUTION THAT IS A WEAK FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE TRUTH IS THAT IT IT'S ONLY WEAK TOP DOWN STRUCTURES THAT IT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRESIDE OVER LARGE POPULATIONS ONE OF THE GREAT LIES ABOUT EMPIRES FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT EMPIRES TEN TO BE INCREDIBLY OWNEROUS THAT TEN TO BE TRANICAL THE LIKE IN YOUR BUSINESS ALL THE TIME AT THE LOWEST LEVEL NOT DURABLE ONES THEY ARET IF YU'LL GET TA HISTORY OF EMPIRES AND THE UNITED STATES IS AN EMPIRE NOW I'M NOT ROOM TUNGMENT A INTERNATIONAL EMPIRE JUST BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION A GOVERNMENT THAT GOVERNS THREE HUNDERED AND FORTY MILLION PEOPLE OVER AR THE COURSE OF THREE THOUSAND HORIZONTAL MILES AND LIKE ANOTHER FIFTEEN HUNDRED VERTICAL MILES AND IN YOUR TALKING ABOUT A LAND AREA IN THE UNITED STATES THAT IS CONTINENTAL IN NATURE MEANS ENORMOUS THAT WOULD BE BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION AN EMPIRE JUST DOMESTICALLY AN EMPIRE I ALL THE STATES OF DE COUNTRIES THEORETICALLY AND THE UNITED STATES WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE A DOMESTIC EMPIRE IT IS JUST O BIG AYRENOT GOVERNING A TINY SPATES LIKE GREAT BRITAIN OR SOMETHING AND YOUENOT GOVERNING HOMOGENIST SPACES EITHER THE UNITED STATES INCREDIBLY DIVERSE AY SO THE ONLY WAY THAT THAT SUCCEEDS IS IF THE TOP LEVEL IS  RELATIVELY LIGHT HANDED AND EVERY DURABLE EMPIRE EVER HAS ACTUALLY HAD A RELATIVELY LIGHT HAND OF THE TOP LEVEL THE GREAT LIE ABOUT THE ROMAN EMPIRE FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT TE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS UNBELIEVABLY OWNERIUS TO PEOPLE IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EMPIRE IS NOT TRUE THE ROMAN EMPIRE COULD BE OWNEROS IF YOUREABUT AGAINST THEM THEY WO'RE COME ING THEIR CRUSH YOU WITH AN IRON HEEL BUT IF YOU 'RE NOT REBELLING AGAINST THEM THOU'RE ACTUALLA RELATIVELEA DECENTRALIZED THE GREAY LIE ABOUT THE ROMAN EMPIRE AGAIN AS THERE IS A HIGHLY CENTRALIZED EMPIRE WAS NOT IF YOU'RE LIVING IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR MUCH OF THE TIME OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE YOU'RE BASICALLY LIVING UNDER  CANAVE A LOCAL POTENT ATE TVERY OFTEN THE ROMANS WERE NEGOTIATING WITH YOU TO APPOINT SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE LIKE SLIGHTLY FRIENDLIER TO YOU AND THAT'S WHY THE ROMAN EMPIRE COULD LAST FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS IF YOU LOOK AT AT OTHER LESS POWERFUL EMPIRES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE OSTRA HUNGARIAN MPIRE THE OSTRO HUNGARIAN EMPIRE WHICH START OFF TO THE HAPSBERG MONARCHY AND WAS AN EMPIRE THAT DOMINATED IN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF EUROPE TTHAT THE HAPSTRO MONARCHY WHICH LAUNCHISIN LIKE THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND THEN LAST THE OTHE OSTRA HUNGARIAN EMPIRE ALL THE WAY UP TO WORLD WERE ONE THE REASON THAT IT WAS ABLE TO TO GOVERN THIS AMOUNT OF TERRITORY WITH THIS DIVERS O POPULATION IS BECASE IT ACTUALY HAD A VERY VERY LIGHT HAND IT WAS IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE VISIBLE BY ITS ABSENCE THAN BY ITS PRESENTS THEY HAD CAN AVE UNIFINED MILITARY UNIFORMS IN UTS KINA IT WE THER THERERE A LOT OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE OSTRA HUNGARIAN EMPIRE ARRANGING FROM JEWS TO MUSLUMS TO ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS TO CALF LEGS TO PROTESTANTS AND THEY'RE ALL LIVING UNDER THE OSTRANGARAN EMPIRE CS THE OSTRO HUNGARIAN EMPIRE ACTUALLY HAD A FAIRILY O FAIRLY DECENTRALIZED APPROACH TO GOVERNMENTS THE SAME THING WAS TRUE ACTUALLY FOR A LOT OF THE OTOMAN EMPIRE THE OOM EMPIRE WAS CONNIMA LAZY EMPIRE IT'SWHY BY THE TIME IT DIED AT IN IN WORLD WERE ONE JUST AFTER WORLD WERE ONE IS CALLED THE SICK OLD MAN C ASSN'T EVEN CAPABLE OF GOVERNING ITS OWN TERRITORY NOW LOT OFPEOPLE SEE THAT AS A FLAW BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN RETAIN ANY SORT OF CENTRALIZATION AT ALL IN A VERY VERY LARGE SPACE IS EITHER LIKE OPPRESSIVE TYRANNY AT HIGH LEVELS WHICH CAN'T BE DONE FOR LONG IS WHAT THE USSUS ARE WEARNED OR YOU CAN HAVE TO HAVE RELATIVE THE CENTRALIZATION THE PROBET IS THE UNITED STATES RY NOW IS NOTTED THE CENTRALIZED EMPIRE THE UNITED STATES RY NOW DOMESTICALLY IS A VERY VERY CENTRALIZED EMPIRE WEN WE ARE SPENDING SEVEN TRILLIAN DOLLARS A YEAR WE ARE ENGAGED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN EVERYTHING FROM HOW MUCH WHAR YOU HAVE N YOUR TOILETS TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE PUT IN JAIL THAT THIS IS A VERY NONTY CENTRA AND AND TO WHAT THAT'S DOING IS IS EXASTRBATING ALL OF THE SOCIAL CONFLICT THAT ALREADY ROYALS UNDER THE SURFACE IT USED TO BE THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA NEARLLY CARE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE IN FLORIDA WERE DOING AN THOSE PEOPLE IN FLORIDEN REALLY CARE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE IN NEW YORK WERE DON CAN LAM THAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR WE CAN PLAYMEN ON THE FACT THET VIRTUALLY ALL POLICY MAKING HAS NOW BEEN ELEVATED TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND NOT ONLY THAT A HUGE PERCENTAT O TAT POLICY MAKING IS MADE BY UNELECTED BEURIC RATS WHO ARE STAFFED THROUGH UNOFFICIAL POLITICAL PATRONAGE NETWORKS THE ONLY ATO PCURE THAT IS TO MINIMIZE THAT POWER THE TOP LEVEL LHAT PEOPLE GO BACK TO DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO IN THEIR OWN LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IRONICALLY IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH TRUST FREER FELLOW AMERICAN THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT AND IF THE ANSWER TO THAT IS KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THE COUNTRY MAINTAINS THAT'S WHY ALL THE LAWFARE THAT WERE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS ME WHAT WE WERE A DANGEROUS MOMENT IN THE UNITED STATES UST SYSTEM SYSTHEMICALLY SPEAKING IS A DANGEROUS MOMENT FOR THE SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES IS VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE ANY BASELINE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM ITSELF WHICH

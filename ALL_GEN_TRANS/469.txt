WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANSCIENCESCIENCE PACE I MAN DREHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING GRIEF GRIEF IS A NATURAL EMOTION THAT MOST EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE HOWEVER GRIEF IS SOMETHING THAT STILL MYSTIFIZE MOST PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE WE OFTEN WONDER WHY GETTING OVER THE LOSS OF SOMEBODY OR A PET IS SO ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING IN SOME CASES ITS OBVIOUS BECAUSE WE HAD A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON OR ANIMAL BUT IN OTHER CASES ITS BEWILDERING BECAUSE SOMEHOW DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS WE ARE UNABLE TO REFRAME AND SHIFT OUR MIND TO THE IDEA THAT THE PERSON OR ANIMAL THAT AT ONE POINT WAS HERE AND SO VERY PRESENT IS NOW GONE TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW WE CONCEPTIALIZE GRIEF BOTH THAT AN MOTIONAL END AT A LOGICAL LEVEL I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU ABOUT THE NAUROW SCIENCE AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GRIEF AND INCREDIBLE FINDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN JUST A FEW KEY LABORATORIES THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT WE ESSENTIALLY MAP OUR EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS I JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE HINT OF WHAT THOSE DIMENSIONS ARE THEY RELATE TO SPACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS AND A DIMENSION CALLED CLOSENESS AND HOW THOSE THREE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE TIME AND CLOSENESS ARE WHAT ESTABLISH VERY CLOSE BONDS WITH PEOPLE AND ARE WHAT REQUIRE REMAPPING REORGANIZATION WITHIN OUR EMOTIONAL FRAME WORK AND AUR LOGICAL FRAME WORK WHEN WE LOSE SOMEBODY FOR WHATEVER REASON WITHIN THAT UNDERSTANDING I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL HAVE GREATER INSIGHT INTO THE GRIEF PROCESS AND SHOULD YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF WITHIN THE GRIEF PROCESS AS I IMAGINE MOST EVERY ONE WILL AT SOME POINT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THAT PROCESS IN WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS AND NAUROW SCIENTISTS DEEM TO BE THE MOST HEALTHY WAY OF GOING THROUGH GRIEF INDEED MOVING THROUGH GRIEF REQUIRES A SPECIFIC FORM OF NAUROW PLASTICITY A REORDERING OF BRAIN CONNECTIONS AND ALSO THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND BODY GONG TO TEACH YOU ABOUT ALL OF THAT TODAY SO YOU CAN A LEARN A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION YOU WILL ALSO LEARN A LOT OF TOOLS THAT YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR KIT OF EMOTIONAL AND REALLY EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL TOOLS THAT WILLALLOW YOU TO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF IN THIS HEALTHY WAY THAT AR REFERR TO EARLIER IWL ALSO POINT OUT SOME OF THE MYTHS ABOUT GRIEF FOR SINCE MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THAT THERE ARE DESIGNATED STAGES OF GRIEF THAT EVERYBODY MOVES THROUGH TURNS OUT THAT RESON RESEARCH REFUTES THAT IDEA THERE ARE DIFFERENT STAGES OF GRIEF BUT NOT EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES ALL OF THEM AND HARDLY EVER DOES SOMEBODY MOVE THROUGH ALL OF THOSE LINEARLY MEANING IN THE SAME ORDER I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT FOR MANY OF YOU THAT ARE NOT EXPERIENCING GRIEF IN THIS MOMENT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THAT TEACHES US THAT HOW WE SHOW UP TO GRIEF MEANING OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OUR BIOLOGICAL STATE THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE IN WHEN A LOSS OCCURS STRONGLY DICTATES WHETHER OR NOT WE END UP IN WHAT'S CALLED COMPLICATED OR NON COMPLICATED GRIEF AND NON COMPLICATED GRIEF IS A FORM OF GRIEF THAT IS VERY PROLONGED AND IN FACT OFTEN REQUIRES THAT PEOPLE GET SUBSTANTIAL PROFESSIONAL HELP SO WHETHER NOT YOUR EXPERIENCING GRIEF THAT'S MILD MODERATE OR VERY INTENSE RIGHT NOW OR WHETHER NOT YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCING ANY GRIEF AT ALL YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND TOOLS THAT WILL HELP YOU NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT WE CALL GRIEF BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS T STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSERS OF TODAYS PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETI GREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH ORE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS TIT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THE'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO HREARE TON OF DATAD NOW SHOWING THAT VITEMIND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMIN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CAROVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOKCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPERATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRE SANT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENTY DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLEPACK WITH YOUR PURCHAS THEIRE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTY DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT GRIEF JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT EVERYBODY AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES GRIEF EITHER MILD GRIEF MODERATE GRIEF ERE EXTREME GRIEF AND IT'S SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS BUT WORTH STATING NONE THE LESS THAT HOW INTENSE GRIEF FEELS AND HOW LONG IT LAST SCALES WITH HOW CLOSE WE WERE WITH SOMEBODY AND IF YOU LEARN THAT THE PERSON WHO WORKS THAT THE COFFEE SHOPER THAT YOU SEE AT THE COFESHOP ON A REGULAR BASIS HAPPEN TO PASS AWAY OR TRAGICALLY GET KILLED AN A CAR ACCIDENT THAT CAN BE QUITE UPSETTING IT CAN BE SOMEWHAT DISORIENTING TO YOU IF YOU FOR INSTANCE JUST SAW THEM YESTERDAY OR THEY SEEM PERFECTLY FINE WHEN YOU SAW THEM LAST BUT OF COURSE THE GRIEF THAT RESULTS FROM THE LOSS OF SOMEBODY TO WHOM YOU HAVE THAT LEVEL OF ATTACHMENT IS FAR AND AWAY DIFFERENT THEN THE LEVEL OF GRIEF THAT YOU WOULD EXPERIENCE FROM THE DEATH OF A VERY CLOSE LOVED ONE A SIBLING APPARENT GOD FORBID A CHILD WHEN THAT TYPE OF LOSS OCCURS IT'S OFTEN THE CASE THAT OUR ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP TO LIFE FEELS DIFFERENT PLACES IN THINGS THAT AT ONCE BROUGHT US JOY AND LAUGHTER NOW BRING THE OPPOSITE THEY BRING US INTENSE FEELINGS OF SADNESS AND LOST PSYCHOLOGISTS AND NURROW SCIENTISTS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COMPLICATED GRIEF AND NON COMPLICATED GRIEF THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR AT THE OUTSET ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM HOWEVER IS THAT COMPLICATED GRIEF WHICH OCCURS IN ABOUT ONE INTEN PEOPLE IS A SITUATION IN WHICH GRIEF DOES NOT SEEM TO RESOLVE ITSELF EVEN AFTER A PROLONGE PERIOD OF TIME LATER IN THE EPISODE A'LL POINT YOU TO THE ACTUAL TESTS THAT ARE USED I'VE A PROVIDED LINXTOSE IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS THAT WILL LOW YOU TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COMPLICATED AND NON COMPLICATED GRIEF THESE ARRIVED THROUGH THE IMPORTANT RESEARCH OF THE WORLD CLASS GRIEF RESEARCHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE AN THE PSYCHOLOGISTS THAT TREAT GRIEF THE IMPORTEN THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT GRIEF IS A PROCESS LIKE ANY BIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENT IT HAS A BEGINNING A MIDDLE AND AN END I DO BELIEVE THAT BEING ABLE TO ORIENT IN TERMS A WHERE YOU ARE IN THAT PROCESS CAN BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL NOT JUST FOR PREDICTING HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO LAST BUT IN ORDER TO CONCEPTIOALIZE THE PERSON OR ANIMAL THAT YOU LOST IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BEST PRESERVE THEIR MEMORY WHILE MAINTAINING YOUR OWN FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY IN LIFE ALONG THOSE LINES I WANT A POINT OUT THAT GRIEF AND DEPRESSION WHILE THEY CAN FEEL QUITE SIMILAR IN CERTAIN WAYS AND HAVE OVERLAPPING SYMPTEMOLOGY LOSS OF APPETITE CHALLENGES SLEEPING CRYING IN THEMIDDLE THE DAY FOR NO APPARENT REASON ET CETERA THEY ARE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PROCESSES THE MODERN RESEARCH TEACHES US FOR INSTANCE THAT GRIEF RARELY RESPONDS WELL TO ANTIDEPRESSENCE WHEREAS DEPRESSION CAN OFTEN RESPOND WELL TO ANTI DEPRESSENCE EVERYTHING WE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND ABOUT GRIEF IS THAT IT IS A DISTINCT PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EVENT IN THE BRAIN AND BODY FROM DEPRESSION RATHER PERHAPS THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT GRIEF IS THAT IT IS ACTUALLY A MOTIVATIONAL STATE IT IS A YEARNING IS IT IS A DESIRE FOR SOMETHING AND SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY IT'S NOTJUST A DESIRE TO HAVE THAT PERSON BACK OR TO HAVE THAT ANIMAL BACK YOU MIGHT THINK WILL THAT'S CRAZY OF COURSE IT IS BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH SOME ONE PASSING AWAY OR AN ANIMAL PASSING AWAY IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING RELIEF FOR THAT PERSON BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN THEIR LIFE TO DAY I'LL TEACH YOU ABOUT GRIEF AS A MOTIVATIONAL PROCESS BECAUSE GRIEF AS A MOTIVATIONAL PROCESS REALLY IS THE WAY THAT SCIENTISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS NOW CONCEPTIALIZED GRIEF AND THE TREATMENTS FOR GRIEF SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MOVE THROUGH THEM EFFECTIVELY AS WE WAIGHE INTO THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOME OF THE COMMON MITHS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT GRIEF SOME OF THE MISTIMIS UNDERSTANDING ARRIVE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ELIZABETH COUBLE ROSS AF PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WROTE THE FAMOUS BOOK ON DEATH AND DYING AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WELL COUBLE ROSS WAS A REAL PIONEER IN ESTABLISHING THAT THERE ARE INDEED DIFFERENT STAGES OF GRIEF THE MODERN SCIENCE BOTH PSYCHOLOGY NERRO SCIENCE POINT TO THE FACT THAT NOT EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES ALL OF THE STAGES THAT COUBLEROSS DEFIND NOR DO THEY MOVE THROUGH THOSE STAGES IN A LINEAR MANNER SOMETIMES THEY'RE OUT OF SEQUENCE IF JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT FIVE STAGES THAT COUBLEROSS ILLUSTRATED BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE REALLY DO EXPERIENCE ALL OF THEM SOMETIMES IN THE ORDER ALL READ THEM BUT AGAIN OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T THE DIFERENT STAGES OF GRIEF VERY QUICKLY ARE DENIAL ANGER BARGAINING DEPRESSION AN ACCEPTANCE IN THAT COUBLE ROSS MODEL DENIAL IS ALWAYS THE FIRSE STAGE AND DENIAL IS JUST AS IT SOUNDS THIS DISBELIEF IT CANNOT BE THERE'S NO WAY A REFUSAL TO ACCEPT THE NEW REALITY THAT THE PERSON OR ANIMAL IS GONE THE SECOND STAGE ANGER IS ONE IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL RECOGNIZES THAT THE PERSON IS INDEED GONE OR THE ANIMAL IS GONE BUT THEIR BODY IN THEIR MIND GO INTO A MOTIVATED STATE THIS IS IMPORTANT WORD EN A RETURN TO THIS IDEA OF GRIEF AS A MOTIV ATED STATE THAT INVOLVES ACTION PLANS IN MORE DEPTH AS WE GO FURTHER AND THEN THIRD STAGES BARGAINING WHAT SOMETIMES CALL THE NEGOTIATING FASE THIS IDEA THAT WELL IF I JUST ON THIS ARE F THEY JUST ON THAT OR EFIDE CALLED MORE OR SOMEHOW REFUSING TO ACCEPT THE REALITY SO I N AWAY THIS CAN BE BLENDED WITH DENIAL IN THINKING WHELL IF I JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT IT WON'T BE REAL THIS KIND OF THING SO AGAIN STAGES CAN BE BLENDED OR BRAIDED TOGETHER BECAUSE EMOTIONS ARE COMPLEX RIGHT EVENTHOUGH THEIR DIFFERENT STAGES TO THIS PROCESS THEY CAN SOMETIMES BE MELDED TOGETHER THE FORESTAGE OF DEPRESSION THAT COUBLEROS DESCRIBED IS ONE OF WHY GO ON LIVING WHY SHOULD I GO ON LIVING WHY SHOULD I CONTINUE IN THIS GRIEF STRICKEN STATE THAT SEEMS TO DEPRIVE ME OF ALL THE RICHNESS OF LIFE THAT I EXPERIENCE WHEN THE PERSON OR ANIMAL WAS STILL HERE AND THEN THE FISTAGE IS ACCEPTANCE THIS INTERNALIZATION NOT JUST COGNATIVELY NOT JUST THINKING BUT EMOTIONALLY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY THAT NOT JUST THIS TWO SHALL PASS BUT THAT IT HAS PASSE AGAIN THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF THAT COUBLEROSS TO FIND WERE IMMENSELY IMPORTANT AS A CRITICAL PARSING OF THE DIFFERENT STAGES THAT ONE COULD MOVE THROUGH BUT UNFORTUNATELY THOSE FIVE STAGES WERE SORT OF TAKEN TO BE GOSPEL FOR A LONG TIME AND WE NOW KNOW BASED ON NOIMAGING BASED ON MORE INDEPT PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION AND FRANKLY MORE RESEARCHERS AND CLINITIONS MOVING INTO THIS AREA AND OBSERVING THAT WHILE MUCH OF WHAT COUBLEROSS DESCRIBED DOES HOLD THROUGH IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND IN FACT THE CONTOUR OF THE GRIEF PROCESS ACTUALLY HAS A LOT OF DIMENSIONS THAT ARE NOT INCAPSILATED BY THOSE FIVE STAGES HERE'S ALSO A LOT OF VARIATION DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT THE LOSS IS DUE TO OLD AGE DISEASE WHETHER NOT THERE WASE SUFFERING PRIOR OR NOT SUICIDE OR NONSUICIDE TYPES TEATH AN LOSSES AND EVEN GRIEF ABOUT NON DEATH LOSSES A RELATIONSHIP BREAK UP OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT OR EVEN HOMESICKNESS IN THINGS OF THAT SORT SO I DO WANT A TIP OUR HATS TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK OF ELIZABETH COUBLEROSS BY NO MEANS AM I OR DO OTHER RESEARCHERS TRYING DISCOUNTER INCREDITBLE CONTRIBUTIONS BUT I THINK NOWADAYS WE HAVE A DIFFERENT AND FRANKLY BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE GRIEF PROCESS IS LIKE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE BETTER TOOLS TO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT GRIEF IS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND HOW TO BEST NAVIGATE GRIEF I'D LIKE YOU TO DO AN EXPERIMENT WITH ME FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES OR SO I'D LIKE YOU TO AT LEAST TRY TO DISCARD OF ALL PRIOR NOTIONS OF GRIEF AS JUST A STATE OF SADNESS I WANT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS AND DOES INVOLVE SADNESS BUT FOR RIGHT NOW LET'S THINK ABOUT GRIEF AS A MOTIVATIONAL STATE AS A DESIRE FOR SOMETHING SPECIFIC IN FACT I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT GRIEF AS AN ATTEMPT TO REACH OUT AND GET SOMETHING THAT YOU VERY MUCH WANT IMAGINE YOURSELF EXTREMELY THIRSTY FOR INSTANCE ON A VERY HOT DAY AND A GLASS OF WATER IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CLEAN GLASS OF WATER AND IT'S COMPLETELY FULL AND YOU SO BADLY WANT TO DRINK THAT WATER BUT N O MATTER HOW INTENSELY YOU WANT IT AND NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY IND REACH IT IT ALWAYS SHIFTS JUST OUTSIDE YOUR REECH SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT YOU ARE TOUCHING IN TO THE EXPERIENCE OF GRIEF HOW DO I KNOW THIS WELL I KNOW THIS BECAUSE BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES INVOLVING WHAT'S CALLED FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONENCE IMAGING F M R I IN WHICH YOU CAN EVALUATE WHICH BRAINAREAS ARE MORE ACTIVE THAN OTHERS ACCORDING TO BLOOD FLOW WHICH CORRELATES WITH NERAL ACTIVITY AND SO FORTH TEACHES US THAT THE BRAIN AREAS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MOTIVATION AND CRAVING AND PURSUIT OR SOME OF THE PRIMARY BRAIN AREAS IN CIRCUITS THAT ARE ACTIVATED IN STATES OF GRIEF I LIKE TO SHARE IN IMPORTANT PAPER WITH YOU IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THAT GRIEF IS NOTJUST A STATE OF SADNESS AND PAIN IT IS INDEED A STATE OF YEARNING AND DESIRE OF SOMETHING THAT IS JUST OUTSIDE YOUR REACH AND UNFORTUNATELY WILL ALWAYS BE JUST OUTSIDE YOUR REECH UNTIL YOU REMAP YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON OR THING THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS POSED FIRST AS A QUESTION SO THAT'S WHILE READED AS SUCH THE TITLE IS CRAVING LOVE EN DURING GRIEF ACTIVATES BRAINS REWARD CENTRE AND THE FIRST AUTHOR OF THIS PAPER IS MARY FRANCIS OCONERSH IS A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA AND WERE ONE OF THE WORLD LEADERS IN THE STUDY OF GRIEF FROM A NUROSCIENCE PERSPECTIVE WITH SOME LUCK WILL GET HER HERE ON THE PODCAST AS A GUEST NOW THIS PAPER HAS SEVERAL IMPORTANT FEATURES ON JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THIS PAPER THAT'S NOT SURPRISING IS THEY FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A STATE OF GRIEF ARE IN A STATE OF PAIN THAT IS BRAINARY IS ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN ACTUAL PHYSICAL PAIN OR MORE ACTIVE THAN IN NON GRIEVING INDIVIDUALS HOWEVER THEY ALSO FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT'S CALLED COMPLICATED GRIEF SHOWED REWARD RELATED ACTIVITY IN A BRAINARA CALLED THE NEUCLIOS ACUMBONS WHAT IS REWARD RELATE ACTIVITY REARD RELATED ACTIVITY IS ACTIVITY OF NURONS THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH MOTIVATIONAL STATES AND THE NEUCLES ACCUMMONS IS A BRAIN CENTER IN WHICH DOPOMINE HAS THE EFFECT OF CREATING A MOTIVATED STATE IF EVER YOU THOUGHT THAT DOPOMINE WAS ONLY ASSOCIATE WITH FEELING GOOD YOU HERE ABOUT DOPOMINE HITS WELL THIS PAPER AND PAPERS LIKE IT FIRMLY TELL US THAT DOPOMINE IS NOT ABOUT FEELING GOOD DOPOMINE IS ABOUT PLACING US INTO A STATE OF DESIRING THINGS AND SEEKING THINGS THIS IS TRUE IN EDICTION THIS IS TRUE WHEN WE'RE HUNGRY AND WE WANT TO EAT THIS IS TRUE WHEN WE WANT TO REPRODUCE THIS IS TRUE IN EVERY STATE IN WHICH WE ARE REACHING FOR SOMETHING OUTSIDE ARE IMMEDIATE ABILITY TO GIVE THAT THING TO OURSELVES THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND GRIEF AND HOW TO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF GRIEF IS NOT JUST ABOUT SADNESS IT IS A STATE OF SAD NESS HENCE THE ACTIVATION OF BRAINAREAS ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN AND IS IT IT IS A STATE OF DESIRE AND REACHING FOR SOMETHING AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT OF EXPERIENCED GRIEF I THINK THAT WILL RESONATE WITH YOU IN THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT GRIEF IS BOTH A STATE OF PAIN BUT ALSO A STATE OF WANTING AND IN THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WE LOSE SOMEBODY EITHER BECAUSE OF BREAK UP OR BECAUSE OF DEATH OR IF AN ANIMAL DIES OR GET'S TAKEN AWAY OR AS MISSING THAT STATE OF WANTING AND DESIRE DRIVES AN ACTIVATION STATE WITHIN US NOW THE KEYTHINGS UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE ACTIVATION OF THOSE REWARD CENTERS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF DOPOMINE PUTS US INTO AND ANTICIPATORY STATE A STATE OF WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN IT ALSO PUTS US INTO A STATE OF ACTION OR DESIRING ACTION OUR BODY IN OUR MIND ARE WHAT I LIKE TO REFER TO AS CENTRE OF MASS FORWARD WE ARE SEEKING HOW TO RESOLVE THE CRAVING EVEN IF WE KNOW THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHY DO I SAY THAT WELL WE UNDERSTAND ALSO ON THE BASIS OF BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES AND ALSO SOME STUDIES IN ANIMALS THAT ALL DESCRIBE IN A MOMENT THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND GRIEF WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW ATTACHMENTS ARE REPRESENTED IN OUR BRAIN AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BOTH ATTACHMENTS AND THE BREAKING OF ATTACHMENTS IN HEALTHY WAYS ARE GOVERNED BY THREE IMPORTANT WHAT WE CALL DIMENSIONS A DIMENSION IS JUST SOME FEATURE OF THE WORLD THAT'S REPRESENTED IN OUR BRAIN SO FOR INSTANCE THE COLOR RED DOESN'T EXIST IN YOUR BRAIN YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE CELLS NURONS IN YOUR EYE THAT RESPOND BEST TO LONG WAY LAVES OF LIGHT AND THOSE LONG WAYLINTS OF LIGHT HAPPEN TO BE WHAT ARE REFLECTED OFF THINGS THAT ARE PERCEIVED AS READ SO IN YOUR MIND YOU HAVE A NOTION OF RED I KNOW THIS IS A LOBIT ABSTRACT BUT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY LIGHTING UP RED NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN AND THATWHY YOU SEE READ YOU ARE LIGHTING UP NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT REPRESENT THE PRESENCE OF READ THINGS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT SIMILARLY WE HAVE NURONS AND MAPS OR WE SAY REPRESENTATIONS OF OTHER DIMENSIONS WE HAVE DIMENSIONS OF TOUCH WE HAVE DIMENSIONS OF SOUND AND AS ALL NOW TEACH YOU WE HAVE THREE DIMENSIONS THAT DEFINE ORE RELATIONSHIP TO PEOPLE AND ANIMALS AND THINGS AND WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ANIMALS AND THINGS ARE WITHIN OUR IMMEDIATE VICINITY OR IF WE KNOW HOW WE COULD ACCESS THEM MIGHT IF SOMEBODY STILL LIVE THERES GENERALLY SOME WAY TO ACCESS THEM UNLESS THEIRE REFUSING TO INTERACT WITH US WELL WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR MOTIVATIONAL STATES CAN OPERATE IN A WAY THAT'S LOGICAL WE KNOW THAT IT FOR INSTANCE IF WE WANT TO FIND OUR MOTHER BROTHER SISTER SIGNIFIC ANOTHER DOG CAP PARROT ET CETERA WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A CERTAIN SET OF STEPS WHAT ARE THOSE THREE DIMENSIONS AND HOW TO THEY WORK THAT S WHAT I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU NOW SO AT RISK OF SOUNDING A LITIBIT TO REDUCTIONIST WE ARE NOW GOING TO DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO ANYTHING EVERYTHING AND ANY ONE IN THESE THREE DIMENSIONS HOW CAN WE DO THAT WHY WOULD WE EVEN WANT TO DO THAT WHY UD WE WANT TO ROB THE COMPLEXITY OF RELATIONSHIPS OF THEIR CONTOUR AND THEIR DETAIL WELL IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE DIMENSIONS IN WHICH WE MAP ARE RELATIONSHIP TO PEOPLE ANIMALS AND THINGS THEN WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS THAT WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ANIMALS OR THINGS ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE TO US WHY IT HURTS SO MUCH AND WHY IT TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME IN ORDER TO RE UNDERSTAND IF YOU WILL OR RE MAP ARE ASSOCIATION TO THEM I PROMISE THAT IN GRASPING THE INFORMATION AM ABOUT TO GIVE YOU YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER OR IENT IN THE GRIEF PROCESS AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH IT MORE EFFECTIVELY THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF RELATING TO SOME ONE OR AN ANIMAL OR A THING ARE SPACE TIME AND CLOSENESS AND IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE EACH ONE AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE GRIEVING PROCESS I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT AND EXPERIMENT THIS EXPERIMENT WAS ACTUALLY DONE THE EXPERIMENT INVOLVES PUTTING PEOPLE INTO A BRAIN SKANNER THAT ALLOWS THE RESEARCH ER TO A VALUATE BRAIN ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT AREAS IN FACT CAN LOOK IN A VERY NON BYAS WAY NOT MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHICH BRAINAREAS ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED THE EXPERIMENT IS THE FOLLOWING THE PERSON SHOUL SAY THE RESEARCH SUBJECT FIRST SEES IMAGEIS OF THINGS THAT RESIDE AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM ONE ANOTHER WHEN I SAY THINGS THESE ARE OBJECTS SO IN ONE CASE IT'S A BEACH OR A PARKING LOT WITH BOWLING BALLS SET AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM ONE ANOTHER THEIR BRAIN IS IMAGED AND AS THEIR BRAIN IS IMAGED THEY SEE DIFFERENT PICTURES OF DIFFERENT SCENES THE BEACH THE PARKING LOT ET CETERA BOWLING BALLS SPACE IN DIFFERENT WAYS CLOSE TOGETHER FAR APART REGULARLY SPACE NON REGULARLY SPACE WHEN ONE DOES THIS SORT OF EXPERIMENT OU SEE A LOT OF BRAINARE IS ACTIVATED NOT SURPRISINGLY THE VISUAL QUARTEXTHE AREA THE BRAIN THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING VISUAL PERCEPTIONS BUT ALSO A BRAIN AREA THAT SEEMS UNIQUELY TUNED TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OBJECTS SO WHETHER NOT THE BOWLING BALLS ARE FAR AWAY OR CLOSE TOGETHER FROM ONE ANOTHER AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE FAR AWAY OR CLOSE TO YOU PHYSICALLY SO LITERALLY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THESE OBJECTS WILL REFER TO THAT MEASURE THAT DIMENSION AS WE CALL IT AS PROXIMITY WHETHE'R NOT ITS VERY CLOSE TO YOU HIGH DEGREE OF PROXIMITY OR FAR AWAY LOW PROXIMITY BUT ITS SIMPLY PHYSICAL SPACE THEN SUBJECTS LISTEN TO TONES THOSE TONES ALSO ARE SPACED FROM ONE ANOTHER SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS MY HAND A MEETING THE TABLE TOP THAT IM HAPPEN BE SITTING IN FRONT OF SO ITS THE IMAGE THE BRAIN OF COURSE ARIES THE BRAIN THEIRE ASSOCIATED WITH AUDITORY PERCEPTION ARE ACTIVE NOT SURPRISINGLY BUT AS THEY VALUATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUNDS AND PATTERNS OF SOUNDS FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN START TO PARSE BRAIN AREAS THAT SEEM UNIQUELY TUNED TO THE SPACING OF SOUNDS INDEPENDENT OF WHAT SOUNDS ARE COMING IN SO WHETHER NOTS MUSICAL NOTES FROM A HAND HITTING THE TABLE OR HUMAN SPEECH THEY IDENTIFIED A BRAIN REGION THAT IS UNIQUELY TUNED THAT IS IT BECOMES ACTIVE SPECIFICALLY IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE SPACING BETWEEN SOUNDS MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS THEY COULD IDENTIFY BRAIN REGIONS THAT WERE ONLY ACTIVATED WHEN THEYE WERE CHANGES IN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN OBJECTS SUCH AS THE BOWLING BALLS THAT IE USED IN THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE AND THEN THE SUBJECTS SAW A DIFFERENT SET OF IMAGES THE IMAGES THAT THEY SAW WERE OF PEOPLE AND OF FACES AND SOME OF THE IMAGES THAT THEY SAW WERE OF PEOPLE'S FACES RIGHT UP CLOSE AND OTHER IMAGES WERE OF PEOPLE AT A DISTANCE WE COULD SEE THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PERSON NOW THEY ALSO VARIED THE EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIP TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT IS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THESE RESEARCH SUBJECTS LIVES SO THEY COULD SHOW THEM PICTURES OF FOR INSTANCE THEIR SISTER OR SOME RANDOM PERSON OFF THE STREET THEY COULD SHOW THEM PICTURES OF APPARENT OR OF A NEIGHBOR OR OF A CELEBRITY THAT'S WELL KNOWN OR OF SOMEBODY THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW AT ALL SO THEY WERE ABLE TO VARY BOTH THE POSITION OF THE PERSON CLOSE OR FAR AND THEY WERE ABLE TO VARY THE EMOTIONAL DISTANCE TO THE PERSON WHICH IS THIS DIMENSION THAT I'M REFERRING TO AS CLOSENESS WHICH IS NOT PHYSICAL CLOSENESS BUT HOW ATTACHED OR HOW WELL YOU KNOW SOMEBODY NOW THIS I MAY BE SOUNDING LIKE A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED EXPERIMENT BUT THET TAKE AWAY FROM THIS EXPERIMENT IS EXQUISITELY SIMPLE AND EXQUISITELY IMPORTANT THE RESULT WAS THAT IN ALL THREE CONDITIONS CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL SPACING OF THESE OBJECTS CHANGES IN THE TEMPORAL THAT IS THE TIME SPACING OF THESE SOUNDS AND CHANGES IN THE EMOTIONAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SUBJECT AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE THE SAME BRAIN AREA WAS UNIQUELY ACTIVATED NOW THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE THING TO FIND BECAUS WHAT IT SUGGESTS IS THAT YES OF COURSE THEIR BRAINAIR IS THEIR ASSOCIATED WITH REPRESENTATION OF VISUAL OBJECTS AND THAT YES OF COURSE THEYE ARE BRAINARIES SASSOCIATE WITH REPRESENTATION OF DIFFERENT SOUNDS AND OF COURSE THEIR BRAINARIES ASSOCIATE WITH FACES WE NOW KNOW THIS IN FAC THERE SOMETHING CALLED THE FUSIVEFORM FACE AREA WHICH IS UNIQUELY TUNED TO FACES BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A UNIQUE BRAIN REGION THAT IS ACTIVATED IN ALL THREE OF THE CONDITIONS I DESCRIBED THAT HAS TO DO WITH HOW FAR YOU ARE FROM SOMEBODY BOTH IN SPACE IN TIME END IN TERMS OF EMOTIONAL CLOSENESS AND THAT BRAIN AREA IT TURNS OUT IS A BRAIN AREA CALLED THE INFERIOR PARIDOL LOBULE THE INFERIOR PRIDA LOBULE NOW YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE INFERIOR PRIDE A LOBULE IS IN FACT YOU ON'T EVEN NEED TO KNOW THE NAME OF THIS BRAIN AREA WHAT YOU DO NEED TO KNOW HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND GRIEF AND HOW TO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF IS THAT YOUR MAP OF PEOPLE IS NOT A MAP OF EMOTIONAL CLOSENESS PERSAY IT IS A MAP OF E MOTIONAL CLOSENESS WHAT WE CALL ATTACHMENT THAT IS INTERWOVEN THAT IS BRAIDED IN IN A VERY INTIMATE WAY WITH YOUR MAP OF WHERE THEY ARE IN PHYSICAL SPACE AND WHERE THEY ARE IN TIME WHEN YOU SAW THEM LAST WHEN YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THEM AGAIN AND IF YOU WERE TO WANT TO SEE THEM HOW MUCH TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO REACH THEM OR FOR THEM TO REACH YOU NOW EARLIER I SAID THAT ONE OF THE KEY FUNCTIONS OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PREDICTIONS AND SO IT'S SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS BUT NONE THE LESS IMPORTANT TO STATE AND RESTATE THAT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ASPECTS OF OUR ATTACHMENTS TO PEOPLE ANIMALS AND THINGS IS OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO SEE THEM AGAIN AND WHEN WE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM AGAIN IN FACT WE COULD SAY THAT OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE SOME ONE OR AN ANIMAL OR THING IN SPACE AND TIME WHERE THEY ARE AND HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE FOR US TO REACH THEM OR THEM TO REACH US IS A PREDICTION OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO ENGAGE IN THE ATTACHMENT IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THIS AT A LITTLE IT MORE DEPTH THAT'S JUST DO A FILLIN THE BLANK EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO THIS NOW IN REAL TIME DWON'T YOU THINK OF SOMEBODY THAT YOU EITHER RELY ON OR THAT YOU CARE ABOUT VERY VERY MUCH AND I'LL JUST ALLOW YOU TO FILL IN THE BLANK ON THIS SENTENCE IF I WANT TO SEE BLANK THE PERSON OR ANIMAL I COULD SEE THEM WITHIN BLANK AMOUNT OF TIME IF RIGHT NOW YOU WANTED TO SEE THIS PERSON OR ANIMAL OR MAYBEVEN A THING HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU TO REACH THEM COULD BE A DAY COULD BE A SECOND COULD BE THER RIGHT NEXT TO YOU WHALE YOU'D HAVE TO DO AS TURN YOUR HEAD NOW ANSWER THIS IF THIS PERSON WERE TO TRAVEL HALF WAY AROUND THE WORLD AND L AND IN THEIR PLAIN I WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THEM WITHIN BLANK MINUTES OF THEM LANDING THE ANSWERS OF THIS OF COURSE WILL WILL DIFFER NOW ID LIKE YOU TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION IF I'D LIKE TO FIND MYSELF IT WOULD TAKE ME EX AMOUNT OF TIME AND OF COURSE IF YOUARE LISTENING TO THIS IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING IT NEARE OF A RATIONAL MIND THE ANSWER TO THAT SHOULD BE ZERO SECONDS INSTANTANEOUS YOU ARE ALWAYS ABLE TO LOCATE YOURSELF IN SPACE AND TIME PROVIDED YOU ARE EIN THE APPROPRIATE STATE OF MIND MEANING NOT A SLEEP FOR INSTANCE THAT LAST QUESTION MIGHT SEEM SOMEWHAT SILLY BUT IT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE IT ILLUSTRATES THE EXTREMES AT WHICH WE MAP OUR RELATIONSHIP TO OURSELVES RELATIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE AN THINGS NOW OF ALL OF THI SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF NEURO PSYCHO BABBLE PARSING OF THE OBVIOUS ID ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUSPEND THAT BELIEF FOR THE MOMENT BECAUSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ALL RELATIONSHIPS ARE MAPPED IN THE BRAIN AN BODY THROUGH THESE THREE DIMENSIONS SPACE TIME AND CLOSENESS OR PROXIMITY OF SPACE PROXIMITY IN TIME AND PROXIMITY OF ATTACHMENT HOW CLOSE OR RICH OR BONDED YOU ARE TO SOME ONE WELL IF YOU CAN UNDERSTND THAT THEN IT ALMOST BECOMES OBVIOUS OR AT LEAST IT BECOMES INTUITIVE AS TO WHY AFTER THE LOSS OF SOMEBODY IN PARTICULAR A DEATH OR THE LOSS OF AN ANIMAL THIS MAP HAS TO BE REORDERED WHY BECAUSE IF WE ARE ATTACHED TO SOME ONE OR AN ANIMAL AT A DEEP LEVEL IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS ON THE BASIS OF A LOT OF WHAT WE CALL EPISOTIC EXPERIENCE A LOT OF EPISOTIC MEMORIES MEMORIES OF THINGS THAT HAPPENE EPISOTIC MEMORIES OR LITERALLY THE CONSCIOUS RECOLLECTION OF YOUR EXPERIENTES OF SOMEBODY OR AN ANIMAL OR A THING AND WITHIN THAT MEMORY YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT AS HAPPENED WITH THEM IN ASSOCIATION TO YOU WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM WHERE IT HAPPEN WHEN IT HAPPENED YOU HAVE A RICH KNOWLEDGE DATA BASE THAT WE CALL IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE MIGHT YOU MIGHT NOT BEWARE OF IT ALL THE TIME BUT IT'S WITHIN YOU OF WHAT THIS PERSON IS LIKE IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING AN THEIR LIFE WHEN SOMEBODY IS TAKEN AWAY FROM US FOR WHATEVER REASON EPISOTIC MEMORIES PERSIST FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY ARE STILL LINKED TO OUR FEELINGS OF ATTACHMENT GRIEF IS THE PROCESS OF UNCOUPLING UNBRAIDING AND UNTANGLING THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN SPACE IN TIME AND OUR ATTACHMENT TO THEM WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS WHEN SOMEBODY OR AN ANIMAL OR A THING IS TAKEN FROM US EITHER BY DECISION OR BY DEATH OR BY CIRCUMSTANCE WELL IN THAT CASE OUR ENTIRE MEMORY BANK AND OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT WHE RE AND WHEN THEY WILL BE AND THEREFORE WHEN WE CAN FEED OUR ATTACHMENT TO THEM AGAIN THAT WHOLE MAP IS OBLITERATED EXCEPT THAT THE ATTACHMENT ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN DISRUPTED ASSUMING THAT YOU ARE DEEPLY ATTACH TO SOME ONE OR AN ANIMAL OR THING THAT ATTACHMENT PERSISTS AND THE GRIEF PROCESS IS ONE IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO REORDER YOUARE UNDERSTANDING OF THEM IN SPACE AND IN TIME THIS IS VERY VERY HARD TO DO AND FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO AT LEAST AT THE OUTSET OF GRIEF THIS IN A VERY NEUROSCIENCY WAY EXPLAINS THIS STAGE THAT COUBLEROS DESCRIBED WHICH MANY AGAIN NOT ALL BUT MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE WHICH IS ONE OF DENIAL HOW COULD IT BE WHY WELL WHEN WE HAVE A RICH CATALOGUE OF EXPERIENCES WITH SOMEBODY OR OF THEM RIGHT IDEAS ABOUT THEM IND WHAT THEY DO HOW THEY SPEND THEIR DAY WHAT THEY DO IN DON'T DO WHERE THEY DO IT ET CETERA WELL THAT MEMORY BANK IS NOT JUST FLUSHED OUT THE MOMENT THAT WE LEARN THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER WITH US WHAT HAPPENS IS THE BRAIN CONTINUES TO MAKE THESE PREDICTIONS THAT THEY WILL BE IN A CERTAIN PLACE OR A CERTAIN TIME RIGHT THATHEY'L BEN A CERTAIN TIMESZONE OR THEY'R WALK IN THE DOOR ANY MOMENT ALL OF THOSE PREDICTIONS STILL HOLD THE NEURAL ACTIVITY CONTINUES WE CALL THIS REVERBATORY ACTIVITY THAT EPLAINS THE YEARNING FOR AND THE DESIRE TO INTERACT AND YET IT'S JUST BEYOND OUR REACH BECAUSE ONCE THEY'RE GONE OUR BRAIN STILL FUNCTIONS IN A WAY THESE NEURALE CIRCUIT STILL FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT PUT US INTO AN ACTION STATE OF SEEKING THEM LOOKING FOR THEM IN THE SAME LOCATION EXPECTING THEM TO CONTACT US AT WHATEVER FREQUENCY THAT WE WERE USED TO HEARING FROM THEM OR THAT WE COULD REACH OUT TO THEM IN RELIABLY GET A RESPONSE IT IS IMMENSELY DISORIENTING IN OTHER WORDS TO MAINTAIN A CLOSE ATTACHMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME TO NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHERE THAT PERSON ANIMAL OR THING IS IN SPACE AND TIME NOW IF THIS SEEMS SOMEWHAT ABSTRACT I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO FLESH IT OUT AND ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO FLESH IT OUT WITH A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE OF GRIEF AND LOSS THAT COMES TO US FROM PERHAPS ONE OF THE GREATEST MINDS IN HUMAN HISTORY AND SOMEBODY WHO WAS INTENSELY GROUNDED IN REALITY AND LOGIC AND INDEED THE PHYSICS OF THE WORLD AND THE PERSON IM REFERRING TO IS NONE OTHER THAN TE NOBELL PRIZE WENTING PHYSICISTS RICHARD FINEMENT MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH RICHARD FINEMEN SOME OF YOU PERHAPS ARE NOT RICHARD FINEMEN WAS A NOBELL PRIZE WNTING PHYSICISTS KNOWN FOR HIS THICK NEW YORK ACCENT HE WAS ACTUALLY NOT FROM BROOKLYN AS MANY PEOPLE THINK HE WAS ACTUALLY FROM FAR ROCK AWAY IN A LONG ISLAND THICK NEW YORK ACCENT VERY A PERSONABLE EXCEPTIONAL TEACHER BRILLIANT MIND HENCE THE NOBLL PRIZE AN PHYSICS ALSO I QUITE FUNNY AND AMUSING PERSON TOLD GREAT ANICTOTES ET CETERA FINDMAN HAD A CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART WHO TURNED OUT TO BE HIS FIRST WIFE HER NAME WAS ARLEEN AND IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT FINEMEN WAS ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH HER HE WOULD TALK ABOUT HER ALL THE TIME SHE HAD A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON HIM AND HIS THINKING AND ULTIMATELY ON HIS PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS LATER IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY READ BOOKS SUCH AS SURELY YOUR JOKING MISTER FINEMEN OR WHAT YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK I ENCURED YOU TO DO SO AND IN FACT THAT QUOTE WHAT YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK IS ACTUALLY A QUOTE NOT A FINEMEN BUT OF HIS FIRST WIFE ARLEEN WHO SADLY DIED AT A VERY YOUNG AGE FROM TUBERCULOSIS MI M MY SHARING FNEMEN STORY OF LOSS OF HIS FIRST BRIDE WELL THE REASON IS FINDMEN CONTINUED TO WRITE LETTERS TO ARLEEN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THIS IS WELL KNOWN ONLY BECAUSE AFTER FINEMEN DIED TIS IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE KEPT AN ARCIVE OF LETTERS TO HIS DECEASED FIRST WIFE AND EVEN THOUGH HE DID EVENTUALLY MARRY AND IN FACT HAD MANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY PEOPLE MAN I THINK WAS MARRIED TWICE MORE MAYBE WAS ONCE MAYBE WAS TWICE THE INTENSITY OF HIS GRIEF BUT ALSO HIS LACK OF ABILITY TO TRANSITION HIS MIND TO A PLACE WHERE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT ARLEEN HAD DIED IS ONE OF THE MORE PROFOUND EXAMPLES OF THIS INABILITY TO RECONCILE THE LOGICAL WORLD AN THE EMOTIONAL WORLD AND I'M NOW GOIN TO READ TO YOU A LETTER THAT FINEMEN WROTE TO ARLEEN THIS WAS DISCOVERED AFTER FINEMEN'S DEATH WHEN THEY WENT THROUGH HIS DEASK AND HIS BELONGINGS AND AS I READ THIS YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR SOME OF THE TYPICAL NARRATIVE OF GRIEF THAT IS NOT UNIQUE TO FINEMEN AND HIS DEAD WIFE BUT THERE ALSO SOME ELEMENTS IN THERE THAT I THINK YOU'LL RECOGNIZE AS HIGHLIGHTING THIS DISBELIEF AND THIS DISSOCIATION BETWEEN THE REALITY OF SOMEBODY'S LOCATION IN SPACE AND TIME AND THE EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT THAT THEY HOLD FOR US AND THEREIN LIES THE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO BETTER NAVIGATE GRIEF SO NOW I'M READING FROM THE LETTER THIS WAS A LETTER DATED OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN FORTY SIX IT'S NOT TERRIBLY LONG BUT BEAR WITH ME DEAR ARLEEN I ADORE YOU SWEETHEART I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKE TO HEAR THAT BUT I DON'T ONLY WRITE IT BECAUSE YOU LIKE IT I WRITE IT BECAUSE IT MAKES ME WARM ALL OVER INCEID TO WRITE IT TO YOU IT IS SUCH A TERRIBLY LONG TIME SINCE I LAST WROTE TO YOU ALMOST TWO YEARS BUT I KNOW YOU'LL EXCUSE ME BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW I AM STUBBORN AND REALISTIC AND I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO SENSE TO WRITING BUT NOW I KNOW MY DARLING WIFE THAT IT IS THE WRIT THING TO DO WHAT I HAVE DELAYED IN DOING AND THAT I HAVE DONE SO MUCH IN THE PAST I WANTED TO TELL YOU I LOVE YOU I WANT TO LOVE YOU I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU SO HERE WE CAN HEAR THE INTENSE EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT THAT CLEARLY AS PERSISTED I FIND IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND IN MY MIND WHAT IT MEANS TO LOVE YOU AFTER YOU ERE DEAD BUT I STILL WANT TO COMFORT AND TAKE CARE OF YOU AND I WANT YOU TO LOVE ME AND CARE FOR ME I WANT T HAVE PROBLEMS TO DISCUSS WITH YOU I WANT TO DO LITTLE PROJECTS WITH YOU IN NEVER THOUGHT UNTIL JUST NOW THAT WE CAN DO THAT WHAT SHOULD WE DO WE STARTED TO LEARN TO MAKE CLOSE TOGETHER OR LEARN CHINESE OR GETTING A MOVIE PROJECTOR CAN'T I DO SOMETHING NOW NO I AM ALONE WITHOUT YOU AND YOU WERE THE IDEA WOMAN AND THE GENERAL INSTIGATOR OF ALL OUR WILD ADVENTURES WHEN YOU WERE SICK YOU WORRIED BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT GIVE ME SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED AND YOU THOUGHT I NEEDED YOU NEEDN'T HAVE WORRIED JUST AS I TOLD YOU THEN THERE WAS NO REAL NEED BECAUSE I LOVED YOU IN SO MANY WAYS SO MUCH AND NOW IT IS CLEARLY EVEN MORE TRUE YOU CAN GIVE ME NOTHING NOW YET I LOVE YOU SO THAT YOU STAND IN THE WAY OF MY LOVING ANYTHING ELSE BUT I WANTED YOU TO STAND THERE YOU DEAD ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE ALIVE SO YOU CAN REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEPTH AN INTENSITY OF THE ATTACHMENT DESPITE TWO YEARS TIME IT CLEARLY HAS NOT WAINED I'LL READ THE FINAL PARAGRAPH NOW I KNOW YOU WILL ASSURE ME THAT I AM FOOLISH AND THAT YOU WANT ME TO HAVE FULL HAPPINESS AND DON'T WANT TO BE IN MY WAY AND THAT YOU ARE SURPRISE THAT I DON'T EVEN HAVE A GIRL FRIEND EXCEPT YOU SWEETHEART AFTER TWO YEARS BUT YOU CAN'T HELP IT DARLING NOR CAN I I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT FOR I HAVE MET MANY GIRLS AND VERY NICE ONES AND I DON'T WANT TO REMAIN ALONE BUT IN TWO OR THREE MEETINGS THEY ALL SEEM ASHES YOU ONLY ARE LEFT TO ME YOU ARE REAL MY DARLING WIFE I DO ADORE YOU I LOVE MY WIFE MY WIFE IS DEAD RICH P S PLEASE EXCUSE MY NOT MAILINGTHISS BUT I DON'T KNOW YOUR NEW ADDRESS SO THERE'S A LOT CONTAINED IN THIS LETTER WE COULD PARTS IT LINE BY LINE BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT CLEARLY THERE'S AN IMMENSE ATTACHMENT THAT'S BEEN MAINTAINED SO THAT'S THAT DIMENSION OF CLOSENESS OF ATTACHMENT CLEARLY THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING THAT SHE'S DEAD IN FACT THE LAST LINE OF THIS LOVE LETTER IS MY WIFE IS DEAD A HE NOW MOVES HER INTO THE THIRD PERSON IN FACT IN THAT FINAL LINE SO HE UNDER STANDS THIS AND YET HE MAINTAINS THE ATTACHMENT AND THE VERY LAST PORTION OF THE LETTER THE P S THE POSTSCRIPT I DON'T KNOW YOUR NEW ADDRESS I SOMEWHAT HUMOROUS IN THE TYPICAL VEIN OF A FINDMEN WRITING OR SPEECH HE ALWAYS HAD IT INTENSE LE AMUSING AND PLAYFUL SENSE OF HUMOR AND YET THERE SOMETHING RALLY CONTAINED IN THIS I DO'T THINK WE'RE READING INTO THIS TOO MUCH IN THET HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER HE FEELS HER AS VERY REAL AND YET HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER HE DOESN'T KNOW HER ADDRESS HE OBVIOUSLY KNOW SHE'S DEAD SO THERE'S NOWHERE TO MAIL IT TO THE REASON'T I SHARED THIS LETTER WITH YOU AS SOPPOSE TO ONE OF THE ALMOST INFINITE NUMBER OF OTHER LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN MY POETS AND AUTHORS AND SCIENTISTS AND EVERYDAY PEOPLE IS THAT IT REALLY INCAPSILATES ALL THREE DIMENSIONS OF ATTACHMENT EN GRIEF THIS NOTIONS OF SPACE WHERE IS SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY TIME THIS DIMENSION OF HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE ME TO REACH THEM OR FOR THEM TO REACH ME WHAT WOULD IT TAKE IN TERMS OF TIME TO BE REUNITED AND THEN THAT LAST DIMENSION OF CLOSENESS AND THE LETTER BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT IN GRIEF WE MAINTAIN THAT SENSE OF CLOSENESS AND YET WE HAVE TO UNCOUPLE IT FROM THESE OTHER TO DIMENSIONS AS WEREFERRING TO H SPACE AND TIME SO WITH THIS SKERN UNDERSTANDING IN MIND A FEW THINGS START TO BECOME OBVIOUS AND ENTIRELY NORMAL TO US IN THE BEST AND MOST HEALTHY SENSE OF THE WORD NORMAL FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'VE LOST SOMEBODY OR AN ANIMAL OR EVEN A THING THAT WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU IT SHOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE TO YOU AS TO WHY YOU KEEP LOOKING FOR THAT PERSON I RECALL THIS IN MY OWN LIFE I HAD THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY GRADUATE ADVISER WHO I WAS VERY CLOSE O ITH DIED QUITE YOUNG OF BREASTCANCER AND HER DAUGHTER SUSHAS TWO DAUGHTERS KEPT HER SELPHONE AND WOULD OCCASTIOALLY CALL ME I HAD A QUITE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR FAMILY AND WHEN IT WOULD COME IN THE NUMBER WOULD POP UP ON MY PHONE OF NOT THE DAUGHTER BUT THE NAME THAT SHOWED UP WAS OF MY GRADUATE ADVISER SO FOR YEARS AFTER SHE DIED MY INITIAL IMPULSE WHEN THE PHONE WOULD RING WAS OMICANISTS SHE'S CALLING IT WAS AN IT WAS A REFLECTIVE EXCITEMENT BECAUSE I TRULY ALWAYS ENJOYED HEARING FROM HER THE A WONDERFUL INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL PERSON I SHOULD SAY SIMILARLY WHEN SOMEBODY PASSES AWAY WE WILL FIND OURSELVES LOOKING INTO A ROOM EXPECTING TO SEE THEM THERE OR EXPECTING THEM TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR ANY MOMENT OR TO CALL ON SUNDAY MORNING AS IT WERE THOSE EXPECTATIONS THOSE PREDICTIONS THAT THE BRAIN IS MAKING ARE ENTIRELY NORMAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED ON THAT DEEP CATALOGUE OF EPISOTIC MEMORY THAT YOU MAINTAIN ABOUT THAT PERSON AGAIN THE DEPTH AND RICHNESS OF THAT CATALOGUE SCALING OF COURSE IN DIRECT RELATION TO HOW CLOSE YOU WERE WITH THAT PERSON I CLOSER TO SOMEBODY MEANS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM MEANS YOUR BRAIN HAS A LOT OF IMPLICIT UNCONSCIOUS NOTIONS OF WHEN AND WHERE AND HOW THEY SHOW UP SO THE FACT THAT YOUR BRAIN AND INDEED SOMETIMES YOUR BODY REACTS TO THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY'LL BE THERE IS ENTIRELY NORMAL IT'S SIMPLY AN ACTIVATION OF THIS MAP THAT INVOLVES CLOSENESS SPACE AND TIME NOT SURPRISINGLY THEN THE REORDERING OF THAT MAP THAT'S REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MOVE THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS IS GOING TO INVOLVE SOME REMAPPING AND YOU AS THE PERSON GRIEVING HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WHICH NOWED AS IT'S CALLED WHICH ELEMENT OR DIMENSION WITHIN THAT MAP ARE YOU GOING TO FOCUS ON SOME PEOPLE REALLY TRY HARD TO DISENGAGE WITH AND REMAP THEIR SENSE OF EMOTIONAL CLOSENESS TO THE PERSON THAT IS IT'S SO UNBELIEVABLY OVERWHELMING TO THEM THAT THE PERSON IS NO LONGER ACCESSIBLE THAT THEY TRY AND CHANGE THEIR IDEAS ABOUT HOW CLOSE THEY REALLY WERE THEY TRY AND CHANGE THEIR EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO THE PERSON AFTER THEY'VE DOT CLEARLY IN THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE IN THE FINDMEN LETTER THAT'S NOT THE CASE THE ATTACHMENT SEEMS INDEED QUITE FIXED AND NOT GOING ANYWHERE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND NERO SCIENTIS GENERALLY AGREE THAT THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH MOVING THROUGH GRIEF IS ACTUALLY TO REMAP THESE DIMENSIONS WHILE MAINTAINING THE CLOSE SENSE OF ATTACHMENT TO THE PERSON BY NOT IN ANY WAY TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE INTENSITY OF THE ATTACHMENT OR HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO YOU SO WEILL NOW TALK ABOUT HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS AND THE DIFFERENT ENTRY POINTS AS THEY'RE CALLED TO ENGAGING IN THAT PROCESS SO ONE STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS STATE OF MIND AND MBODY THAT WE CALL GRIEF IS THAT THE IDEA THAT SOME ONE OR AN ANIMAL OR A THING SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST ANY MORE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE BRAIN CAN EASILY CONCEPTIUALIZE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WE AS BEINGS THAT HAVE A BRAIN AND A BRAIN AS AN ORGAN THAT MAKES PREDICTIONS TENDS TO RELY MORE ON EXPERIENCE THAN KNOWLEDGE IN OTHER WORDS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ONE OR AN ANIMAL OR A THING IS GONE THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST AT LEAST NOT IN THE DIMENSIONALITY THAT WE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO RELATING TO THEM IN IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND LOGICALLY BUT THAT EMOTIONALLY IS VERY HARD TO UNDO AND FROM A MEMORY PERSPECTIVE IS VERY HARD TO UNDO SO IT'S NOCIOUS THAT WE ARE IN A STATE OF EMOTIONAL DISBELIEF ITS THAT WE HAVE NURONS LITERALLY NERVE CELLS AND NERLE CIRCUITS CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NERVE CELLS THAT ARE DEDICATED TO THIS VAST IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT THAT PERSON ANIMAL OR THING AND JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER IN THE DIMENSIONALITY MEANING IN THE CONFIGURATION ALIVE OR PRESENT IN OUR LIFE THAT THEY WERE BEFORE DOESN'T ELIMINATE THOSE MEMORIES THOSE MEMORIES PERSIST AND SO ANY TIME WE CALL TO MIND THE PERSON'S NAME OR WE CALL TO MIND THINGS THAT REMIND US OF THEM OR WE SUDDENLY FEEL THE DESIRE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM THE MEMORIES THOSE EPISOTIC IMPLICIT MEMORIES AS THEY ARE CALLED ALL THAT MENU AND LIBRARY OF KNOWLEDGE SLAMS US STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND PUSHUS US INTO A MODE OF WANTING TO ACT IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THEM STILL BEING HERE IN THE WAY THAT ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE TOLD US THEY WERE WHEN WE ACQUIRED IT THAT'S A VERY LONG WINDED WAY OF SAYING THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL STATE WHEN WE ARE IN A STATE OF GRIEF IN FACT QUITE THE OPPOSITE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT THE MEMORIES BECAUSE THE MEMORIES OURE BASED ON OUR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THEM AND THOSE MEMORIES ACTUALLY DO NOT APPLY TO OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF THEM AND AGAIN EVEN THOUGH OUR BRAIN IS A PREDICTION MACHINE AND IT'S A VERY GOOD ONE IT'S NOT PERFECT IN FACT IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT SO REALLY MOVING THROUGH GRIEF AS A PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING HOW RELATIONSHIPS ARE MAPPED IN THE BRAIN SPACE TIME AND CLOSENESS ALSO CALL ATTACHMENT UNDERSTANDING THOSE THREE DIMENSIONS UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE CLOSELY LINK AND THEN UNDERSTANDING THAT SIMPLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEBODY OR SOME THING OR AN ANIMAL IS IN ACCESSIBLE TO US DOES NOT ALLOW US TO DISCARD OF ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OUR BRAIN IS CONSTANTLY GENERATING EXPECTATIONS OF HOW TO ACCESS THEM EVEN IF WE KNOW THAT'S COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL NOW THIS SHOULD I WOULD HOPE ASSIST YOU IN MOVING THROUGH GRIEF IT'S NOT A TOOL OF THE SORT OF LIKE A SWITCH THAT YOU CAN FLIP AND SUDDENLY NOT FEEL GRIEF BUT IT DOES POINT TO A SPECIFIC SET OF MECHANISMS OR A SPECIFIC SET OF STEPS THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN ORDER TO START TO MOVE THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS IN THE MOST ADAPTIVE AND AFFECTIVE WAY AND IN A WAY THAT STILL HOLDS IN MIND YOUR CLOSE ATTACHMENT TO THE PERSON SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE TOOLS FOR ADAPTIVLY MOVING THROUGH GRIEF YOUS OUR TOOLS GLEAN FROM THE RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGY THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE NERL SCIENCE LITERATURE SI'VE SYNTHESIZED MY UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE THREE LITERATURES TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS THAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE THE FIRST ONE INVOLVES THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND REALLY THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DISENGAGE OR DISMANTLE YOUR REAL ATTACHMENT TO SOME ONE AN ANIMAL OR A THING THAT'S A REAL THING AND THERE IS ACTUALLY NO ADAPT OF REASON TO TRY ING PERSUADE YOURSELF OR NUMB YOURSELF OR SOMEHOW AVOID THE THINKING OF JUST HOW MUCH THEY MEANT TO YOU WHAT IS IMPORTANT HOWEVER IS THAT YOU MAKE SOME EFFORT TO SHIFT YOUR MIND SET AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PERSON IN A WAY THAT HOLDS IN MIND THAT YES INDEED THE ATTACHMENT IS VERY REAL AND IN SOME CASES IS VERY VERY INTENSE BUT IS NOW GOING TO BE UNCOUPLED FROM THE OTHER TWO DIMENSIONS OF THE MAP NAMELY SPACE AND TIME SO AGAIN JUST TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THERE'S NO REASON TO TRYING CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT YOU WEREN'T ACTUALLY THAT CLOSE TO THIS PERSON OR THEM TO YOU THERE'S NO REASON TO TRY AND REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF THAT ATTACHMENT TO THE CONTRARY YOU WANT TO ANCHOR YOURSELF TO THAT ATTACHMENT BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PERSON AND YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THE PERSON ARE NOT ORIENTED TOWARD OR IN REFERENCE TO I SHOULD SAY THAT MAP THAT DEEP CATALOGUE OF MEMORIES THAT YOU HAD NOW THIS IS NOT SIMPLY A FANCY WAY OF SAYING DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST THIS IS SAYING YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN YOUR SENSE OF ATTACHMENT BUT YOU NEED TO START MAKING PREDICTIONS AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW YOU'ARE GOING TO AN ENGAGE WITH THAT ATTACHMENT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THOSE THINGS WITHOUT THE EXPECTATION THAT THINGS THAT ONCE HAPPEN BEFORE ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN SO IT'S A COMPLICATED PROCESS YOU CAN IMAGIN BUT YOU REALLY WANT O HOLD AN REGISTER TWO THINGS AT ONCE SOR LIKE SPINNING TWO PLATES AT ONCE AND THEREFORE ITS CAN A FEEL LIKE EFFORT ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SET ASIDE A DEDICATED PERIOD OF TIME OF MAY BE FIVE ER TEN MAYBEEN AS MUCH AS THIRTY MINUTES OR DEPENDING ON YOUR CAPACITY THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES IN WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL DEEPLY INTO YOUR CLOSENESS IN YOUR ATTACHMENT TO THAT PERSON ANIMAL OR THING BUT YOU ARE CONSCIOUSLY GOING TO TRY IN PREVENT YOURSELF FROM THINKING ABOUT A COUPLE OF CATEGORIES OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY TRYING DISENGAGE FROM ANY ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE IN WHAT'S CALLED COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING THE WHAT IF WHAT IF I HAD CALL THEM A DAY EARLIER WHAT IF THEY HAD TAKEN A DIFFERENT ROUTE HOME WHAT IF I HAD TAKEN A DIFFERENT ROUTE HOME THESE COUNTERFACTUAL MODES OF THINKING ARE AN INFINITE LANDSCAPE OF POSSIBILITY AND THEY AVE VERY CLOSELY TIE TO GUILT GUILT IS AN INTERESTING EMOTION WE SHOULD PELLY DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT GUILT BUT GUILT AS DEFINED BY PSYCHOLOGIST EN NER O SCIENTISTS IS ACTUALLY A WAY OF ASSIGNING OURSELVES MORE AGENCY MORE CAPABILITY OF CONTROLLING REALITY THAN ACTUALLY EXISTS AND IT'S A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE AND I WANT TO BE CLEARER IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT GUILT IS NEVER AN APPROPRIATE RESPONS BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF GRIEVING GUILT IS VERY PRECARIOUS BECAUSE IN THINKING I COULD HAVE DONE THIS OR IF I HAD ONLY DONE THAT YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY EXPLORING AN INFINITE LANDSCAPE OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN NEVER REFU YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT HAD YOU NOT GONE DOWN A DIFFERENT PATH OR THEY HAD NOT TAKEN A PARTICULAR PATH IN LIFE THAT THINGS WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENT BUT YOU CAN'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD HAVE WORKED AS WELL MEANING YOU ACTULLY DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR WHAT IF ARE TRUE AND YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT TRUE AND SO AS AN INFINITE SPACE IT'S A VERY PRECARIOUS ONE AND IT WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO UNCOUPLE THAT INTENSE EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT THAT I'M TELLING YOU AS ASHALY VITAL TO HOLD ON TO FROM THAT CATALOGUE OF EPISODIC MEMORY THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISH IN FACT IT'S GOING TO STRENGTHEN THOSE SPONDS SO IN THIS DEDICATED FIVE OR TEN OR THIRTY WHATEVER PERIOD OF TIME YOU CAN TOLERA ATE AND MAINTAIN FOCUS THE IDEAS TO THINK ABOUT YOUR ATTACHMENT IN A RICH WAY AND TO PERHAPS EVEN EXPERIENCE THAT IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY I THINK IF YOU ARE IN A STAGE OF GRIEF THAT ACTIE L BE FAIRLY REFLECTSIVE TO DO BUT TO TRY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO HOLD THAT GRIEF IN THE PRESENT AND TO BE CONNECTED TO YOUR IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT SO YOU WANT ORIENT YOURSELF INCURRENT SPACE AND TIME RATHER THAN FOCUS ON MEMORIES OR WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE HAPPEN OR THE WISH THAT THEY WERE STILL THERE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THINKING ABOUT THE DEPTH AND RICHNESS OF THAT ATTACHMENT THIS IS IT OBVIOUSLY A TIHTROPE WALK SO TO SPEAK IT'S AN EMOTIONALLY CHALLENGING AND SOMETIMES EVEN WILL BE EXPERIENCE AS A PHYSICALLY CHALLENGING TOOL OR EXPERIENTS BUT IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ATTACHMENTS AND GRIEF ARE REPRESENTED IN THE BRAIN THIS CAN BE AN IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL PRACTIS BECAUSE IT IS THE FIRST STEP AND INDEED IT REPRESENTS MANY OF THE STEPS IN THE VOYAGE FROM THE INITIAL SHOCK OF LOSS TO OUR ABILITY TO HOLD IN MIND SOMEBODY OR AN ANIMAL OR A THING IN A WAY THAT STILL LOWS US TO FEEL THE DEPTH AND FULLNESS OF CONNECTION TO THEM WITHOUT FEELING THE YEARNING THAT REACHING FOR THE GLASS OF WATER THAT UNFORTUNATELY WILL NEVER BE RESOLVED KEEP IN MIND THAT AS YOU EMBARK ON THIS PROCESS IT IS ENTIRELY NORMAL FOR YOUR MIND TO FLIP INTO VARIOUS STATES OF EXPECTATION THAT THEY'RE SUDDENLY CAN TO BE THERE IN FACK BECAUSE OF THE CLOSENESS OF THESE THREE DIMENSIONS IN THE MAP SPACE TIME AND ATTACHMENT IT'S ENTIRELY NORMAL THAT WHEN YOU START TO THINK ABOUT YOUR ATTACHMENT TO SOMEBODY OR N ANIMAL OR A THING THAT YOU ALMOST ARE TO EXPERIENCE THEM AS PRESENT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT I'LL SHARE WITH YOU A SOMEWHAT BIZAR OUR IT SOUNDS OF IS ARTISTS TO ARTICULATE OUT LOUDBA MANY YOU PERHAPS WILL RESONATE WITH THIS FOR YEARS AFTER MY GRADUATE ADVISER DIED I WOULD GET AN EXPERIENCE OF SOME ONE TOUCHING THE BACK OF MY NECK WHEN I WOULD THINK ABOUT HER AND THAT WAS NOT AN EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD WITH HER IIS A PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP I DON'T EVER RECALL HER TOUCHING IN THE BACK OF MY NECK WOR ME TOUCHING THE BACK OF MY NECK IN HER PRESENCE OF AT LEAST NOT ON ANY REGULAR BASIS SO IT WAS VERY PERPLEXING TO ME AND THEN I ENCOUNTER THIS INCREDIBLE LITERATURE ON GRIEF WHICH SAID THE FOLLOWING GRIEF IN MANY WAYS IS LIKE A PHANTOM LIMB FOR THOSE YOU THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR MANY PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE AMPUTATION OF A LIMB THER THROUGH SURGERY OR ACCIDENT OR OTHERWISE WE'LL FEEL IN A VERY GENUINE WAY THAT THE LIMB IS STILL PRESENT EVEN THOUGH WHEN THEY LOOK FOR THE LIMB IT'S NOT THERE SO THEY CAN FEEL PAIN AN LIMBS THEY CAN FEEL THE SENSATION OF TOUCH THERE SOME FAMOUS EXPERIMENTS FROM THE NAUROLOGIST AN MY FORMER COLLY UNIVERSIY CALIFORNIA SANDIAGO GOES BY HIS LAST NAME RUMMA CHONDRON SOME PEOPLE JUST CALL HIM RAMA HIS AN INCREDIBLE SCIENTIST AND AS TON A LOT OF REALLY IMPORTANT WORK IN PARTICULAR ON PHANTOM LIMB AMONG OTHER THINGS AND HAS DONE SOME BE UTIFUL EXPERIMENTS SHOWING THAT PEOPLEWHO HAVE PHANTOM LIMB PAIN OR THAT ARE EXPERIENCING DIFFERENT SENSATIONS IN THEIR PHANTOM LEM THAT CAN BE VERY INTRUSIVE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT EXPECTING SOME ONE TO WALK THROUGH THE DOOR WHO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW IS DECEASED CAN BE VERY INTRUSIVE FROMACHONDERINS UNBEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS SHOWING THAT IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE WHAT'S CALLED THA MIRROR BOX THIS IS A A BOX IN WHICH YOU INSERT AND INTACT LIMB AND THERE SOME MIRRORS THAT GIVE YOU THE VISUAL IMPRESTION THAT THE OTHER LIMB IS STILL PRESENT AND YOU MOVE THE INTACKED LIMB AND YOU GET A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE NONEXISTENT BUT NONE THE LESS VISUAL IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM LIMB MOVING THAT YOU CAN RESOLVE SOME OF THE PAIN OF A LIMB THAT FEELS OTHERWISE CRAMPED UP ANOTHER WORDS THE VISUAL PERCEPTION CAN REVERSE SOME OF THESE PHANTOM SENSATIONS IN MANY WAYS THE PHANTOM LIMBSONARIO AND WHAT I DESCRIBED ABOUT A SENSATION OF BEING TOUCH ON THE BACK IN THE NECK OR THIS FEELING THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE ENGAGE IN THE THINKING AND THE EMOTIONS OF OUR ATTACHMENT TO SOME ONE AN ANIMAL OR THING IS VERY MUCH LIKE A PHANTOM LIMB ONLY IT EXIST IN THE EMOTIONAL SPACE AND IT EXISTS BECAUSE IT IS REACTIVATION OF THESE MAPS ABOUT SPACE TIME AND PERSON AND SO IF THE PROCESS OF MOVING THROUGH GRIEF ADAPTIVELY IN A HEALTHY WAY INVOLVES MAINTAINING THE ATTACHMENT BUT UNCOUPLING THAT ATTACHMENT FROM THE SPACE AND TIME REPRESENTATION OF THAT PERSON ANIMAL OR THING THAT WE HAD BEFORE THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES WHERE SHOULD WE PLACE OUR EXPECTATION OF THEM MIGHT NOW THAT OF COURSE WILL VARY FROM PERSON A PERSON SOME PEOPLE WITH PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WILL INDEED BELIEVE THAT THE SOUL OF THE PERSON THE MOLECULES OF THE PERSON HAVE BEEN REORDERED AND EXIST IN SOME SORT OF EITHER DISTRIBUTED DOMAIN RIGHT THAT THEY ARE IN EVERYTHING OR THEY ARE IN ONE LOCATION I'M NOT HERE TO SPEAK TO THAT ONE WAY OR THE OR THE OTHER E THERE'S NO GOOD EXPERIMENT I KNOW EITHER TO PROVE OR DISPROVE THAT NOR WOULD I WANT TO S NOT THE JOB OF SCIENCE FRANKLY HOWEVER ALLOWING OURSELVES TO PLACE NOTIONS OF WERE THAT PERSON ANIMAL OR THING IS IN OUR IN THEIR CURRENT NEW CONFIGURATION WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE ASHES DASHES DUST TO DUST OR THAT THE PERSON SOUL COMES OUT OF THEIR BODY THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS THAT PEOPLE HERE OR SOME PEOPLE THINK WELL IT'S JUST MOLECULES AND THEY DISINTEGRATE AND ARE REORDERED AND COME UP AS THE PLANTS IN THE TREES AGAIN IN YEAR INFINITE NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES AND IT DEPENDS A LOT ON PERSONAL BELIEF IT IS HOWEVER ESSENTIAL THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE SOME FIRM REPRESENTATION OF WERE THAT PERSON ANIMAL OR THING IS SO THAT YOU CAN PLUG IT INTO THIS MAP THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL MAP OF SPACE TIME AND ATTACHMENT THE PROCESS OF MOVING THROUGH GRIEF CAN'T SIMPLY BE THAT WE HOLD ON TO THE ATTACHMENT AND WE DISCARD WITH ANY UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THEY ARE IN SPACE AND TIME AND ACTUALLY THE THE LETTER THAT FINDMEN WROTE TO HIS DECEASED WIFE ARE LEAN AGAIN SO BEAUTIFULLY AND REALLY POIGNANTLY ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER ON THE ONE HAND HE REALLY UNDERSTANDS THAT SHE'S GONE AND ON THE OTHER HAND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE STILL VERY MUCH EXPECTS HER TO BE THERE THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO MAIL THE LETTER BUT THEN COURSE IN THIS FINAL SOMEWHAT HUMOROUS LINE HE DOESN'T KNOWHERE TO SEND THE LETTER HE TELLS US WHAT'S VERY CLEAR AND I THINK IS VERY HEALTHY IS THE FACT THAT THE EMOTIONAL BOND IS STILL THERE THAT THAT IS MAINTAINED AND SO THIS TOOL IF YOU WILL OF DEDICATED BLOCKS OF TIME FOR REALLY SPENDING SOME EFFORT AND IT IS INDEED EFFORT TO ACTS AS THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WHILE TRYING TO UNCOUPLE THE OTHER NODES OF THE MAP AS IT WERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS HARD YOU SHOULD EXPECT IT TO BE HARD BHAT IN TERMS OF THE OAPTIONS ONE HAS IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH GRIEF IT IS INDEED THE MOST ADAPTIVE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT IT YOURE NOT ENGAGING IN THIS COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING THE WHAT IF WHAT IF WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT DROWNING IT OUT WITH SUBSTANCES OR DELUSION OR WITH OTHER WAYS OF DISTRACTING YOURSELF SO IN THAT SENSE IT IS TRULY ADAPTIVE OOF COURSE I DON'T WANT IMPLY THAT I'M A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISM CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A PLACE FOR WORKING WITH THE TRAIN PROFESSIONAL TO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF ESPECIALLY THESE SITUATIONS THESE WHONE IN TEND PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH WHAT'S CALL COMPLICATED GRIEF OR VERY PROLONGE GRIEF THOSE ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IN GENERAL POINT TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE HAVE IT AN EXCEPTIONALLY HARD TIME MOVING THROUGH GRIEF WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN WAYS TO MOVE THROUGH THEM WITH OR WITHOUT A A PROFESSIONAL TO ASSIST YOU BUT NONE THE LESS WE'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND ON THE BASIS OF NERO SCIENCE WHAT SOME OF THE MORE ADAPTIVE AND FUNCTIONAL WAYS OF MOVING THROUGH GRIEF ARE IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW A TOOL OF THE SORT THAT WERE DESCRIBING OUGHT TO WORK AND WHAT ITS DESIGN TO ACCOMPLISH AT A MECHANISTIC LEVEL LIGHT TO TEACH YOU ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF YOUR BRAIN FUNCTION THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH GRIEF AND THE PROCESS OF MOVING THROUGH GRIEF BUT AS A LOUGHT TO DO WITH OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE S WELL SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH A BRAINARY CALL THE HIPPOCAMPUS THE HIPPOCAMPUS IS A STRUCTORE THAT 'S INVOLVED IN THE FORMATION OF NEW MEMORIES BUT NOT THE MAINTENANCE OF MEMORIES I DISCUSS THE HIPPOCAMPUS IN DETAIL IN OUR EPISODE ON MEMORY AND OUR EPISODE WITH OUR GUEST DOCTOR WENDYSEZUKI FROM NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AND EXPERT ON LEARNING AND MEMORY DURING THOSE TWO DISCUSSIONS I DO NOT HOWEVER TOUCH IN TO WHAT THE DIFFERENT SELL TYPES ARE IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND THE DIFFERENT ROLLS THEY PERFORM AND TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE INDEED DIFFERENT SELTYPES IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND THEY PERFORM VERY DIFFERENT ROLLS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO THE GRIEF PROCESS WE HAVE CELLS IN OUR HIPOCAMPUS MEANING YOU HAVE CELLS IN YOUR HIPPOCAMPUS THE SELLS ARE NURONS NERVE CELLS THAT FIRE ANY TIME OR AND WHEN WE SAY FIRE I SHOULD JUST REMIND YOU I MEAN HAVE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY ANY TIME THAT WE ENTER OF PARTICULAR FAMILIAR LOCATION SO FOR INSTANCE THINK ABOUT YOUR BEDROOM AND THINK ABOUT WHERE THE BED IS AS YOU DOING THAT THESE SO CALLED PLACE CELLS ARE FIRING NOT NECESSARILY TO REPRESENT THAT IT'S A BED AT THAT LOCATION BUT TO REPRESENT THE LOCATION IT SELF WE ALSO HAVE NURONS IN OUR HIPPOCAMPUS AND ELSEWHERE IN OUR BRAIN I SHOULD SAY THAT REPRESENT PROXIMITY SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE TO WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT AND WALK INTO THE KITCHEN AND IT'S SOMEWHAT DARK AND YOU ORIENT TOWARD THE SINK TO GET YOURSELF A GLASS OF WATER OR TO THE REFRIGERATOR TO GET YOURSELF SOMETHING TO DRINKOR TO EAT AS YOU GET CLOSE TO  THE SINK OR THE REFRIGERATOR THERE ARE NURONS IN YOUR HIPPOCAMPUS THAT ARE GOING TO START ENGAGING ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THE MERE EXPECTED PROXIMITY OF THE SINCA REFRAGERATOR AND YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE HENCE THE WORD EXPECTED NOW THAT ALL SEEMS FINE AND GOOD YOU'VE GOT NURONS THAT REPRESENT WHERE THINGS ARE AND SORT OF GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THOSE SAME NURONS MAP TO OUR EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS WE GENERALLY KNOW WHERE TO FIND OUR LOVED ONES EVEN IF THEY DON'T LIVE WITH US WE GENERALLY KNOW WHAT CITY THEREIN EVEN IF THEIRE TRAVELLING WE GENERALLY HAVE A SENSE OF WERE THEIR TRAVELING OR THE GENERAL ARE AN WHICH THEIR TRAVELING PLACE CELLS IN PROXIMITY SELLS ARE INVOLVED IN THAT KIND OF MAPPING AND REPRESENTATIONS AS WELL NOW THERE'S A THIRD KIND OF SCELL THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THE SORT OF TOOL THAT WE TALK ABOUT EARLIER THAT TOOL OF HOLDING ON TO THE E MOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO SOMEBODY AND YET TRYING TO DELIBERATELY REMAP OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THEY ARE IN SPACE AND TIME AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH A CATEGOR OF CELLS CALLED TRACE CELLS TRACE CELLS WERE DISCOVERED BY NUMBER OF LABORATORIES I THINK THE MOST OM RENOWNED OF THOSE IS THE MOSER LABORATORY THE MOSERS OR A COUPLE ACTUALLY THEY WERE A COUPLE THERE NOW I THINK AMICABLY SEPARATED OR DIVORCED IT'S NOT WITH HIS EPISODES ABOUT IF I HAVE THAT WRONG FORGIVE ME OM EDWARD AND BRITAN THEY ARE THEIR NAMES OF THE RELATIONSHIP IS IN WHAT'S IMPORTANT EXCEPT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE THE WORK THAT THEY DID TOGETHER IN ONE FORMER ANOTHER WHICH WAS VERY IMPORTANT WORK ESTABLISHING THIS CATEGORY OF CELLS IN THE NOT JUST IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS BUT IN ANAREA THE BRINK ALL THE INTERHINAL QUARTECS THAT ACT AS A SORT OF CORDINATE SYSTEM TO ORIENTUS IN SPACE AND TIME TRACE CELLS ARE ACTIVATED WHEND WE EXPECT SOMETHING TO BE AT A GIVEN LOCATION BUT IT'S NOT THERE EXPERIMENTS DONE IN THEIR LABORATORY AND ANOTHER LABORATORIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU GIVE A ROAD INT OR FRANKLY A PERSON A OBJECT THAT ALWAYS RESIDES AT THE SAME LOCATION AND WE REACH TO IT IN ORDER TO ACCESS AT LETS SAY A WHERE YOUR COFFEE MAKER IS IN THE IN THE MORNING UM I DO A POR OVER COFFEE IF I'M DRINKING COFFEE OR MATEL DO A POR OVER IT'S ALWAYS MORE LESS IN THE SAME LOCATION AND SO THERE ARE PLACE CELLS AND PROXIMITY CELLS THAT RELATE TO MY BEING ABLE TO FIND THAT POREOVER COFFEE CONE THING HOWEVER IF I WERE TO GO TO THAT LOCATION AND IT WASN'T THERE THE TRACE CELLS THESE NURONS IN MY HYPPOCAMPUS AND AN ENTERONAL CORTEXAN ELSEWHERE CAUSE AGAIN THESE SELLS ARE CONNECTED BY WAY OF CIRCUITRY BY WEAVE CONNECTIONS THOSE TRACECELLS WOULD FIRE WE COULDEVEN CALL IT A TRACE CIRCUIT IT'S A CIRCUIT THAT HAS AN EXPECTATION THAT SOMETHING WILL BE IN A LOCATION BUT WHEN SOMETHING IS NOT AT THAT LOCATION THIS CIRCUIT BECOMES ACTIVE THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A NURAL CIRCUIT AND A SET OF NURONS THAT A RESPONSIBLE NOT FOR THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING BUT THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE BASED ON NUROIMAGING STUDIES AND STUDIES IN ANIMAL MODELS THAT TRACE CELLS BECOME VERY ACTIVE IN THE IMMEDIATE STAGE AFTER THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE THAT THE BRAIN AND IT OUR MAPS OF THE PERSON PLACE OR THING THAT WE KNOW COGNITIVELY WE UNDERSTAND WE EVEN BELIEVE THEY ARE GONE THEY ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE FOR WHATEVER REASON DEATH OR OTHERWISE AND YET WE HAVE NURONS THAT ARE FIRING TO REVEAL THAT ABSENCE TO US AND THESE NURONS ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH NURONS THAT TELL US WERE THINGS OUGHT TO BE SO IF YOU FEEL THE EXPECTATION OR YOU SENSE THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD WALK THROUGH THE DOOR ANY MOMENT OR CALL AT ANY MOMENT OR BE NEXT YOU WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND YET YOU COGNITIVELY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WON'T THAT THERE'S NO REAL REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BECAUSE THEY ARE INDEED GONE YOU ARE NOT CRAZY IN FACT IT'S SIMPLY A REFLECTION OF THE NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THESE TRACE CELLS AND TRACE CIRCUITS NOW I LIKE TO CONSIDER WHY TO PEOPLE BOTH WHO ARE INTENSELY ATTACHED TO A PERSON THAT IS NO LONGER THERE CAN EXPERIENCE THE GRIEF OF THE LOSS OF THAT PERSON IN SUCH DIFFERENT WAYS THIS IS OFTEN OBSERVED YOU CAN HAVE YOU KNOW GOD FORBID INCREDIBLY SADLY IN CASES WHERE A CHILD IS LOST WHERE BOTH PARENTS ARE GRIEVING INTENSELY BUT ONE SEEMS TO FEEL IT AT A EMOTIONAL DEPTH AND LEVEL THAT SEEMS DISTINCT FROM THE OTHER NOW OF COURSE KEEP IN MIND THAT WE NEVER REALLY KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE IS SOMETHING ACTUALLY THAT WAS RAISED IN THE EPISODE WHERE I INTERVIEWED A PSYCHIATRIST AND RESEARCH OR COLLEAGUE OF MIND FROM STAMFORD CARLDISEROFF AS A PSYCHIATRIST I HEARD HIM SAY ONCE THAT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL IN FACT A LOT THE TIMES WE DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW HOW WE FEEL ARE AT LEAST DESCRIBING THAT IS QUITE CHALLENGING WITH LANGUAGE OFTEN AND INDEED THAT IS THE CASE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL THERE'S NO CLEAR WAY OF KNOWING THAT THE EXPRESSION SOME ONE ELSE HAS OR WHITHER NOT THEIR CRYING OR NOT OR THEIR BODY LANGUAGE REALLY REPRESENTS HOW THEY FEEL INSIDE SO THAT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND NONE THE LESS THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A SORT OF A SPLIT AMONG PEOPLE AND INDEED AMONG ANIMALS AS WELL EVEN WITHIN A SPECIES IN TERMS OF HOW INTENSELY THEY FEEL THE YEARNING ASPECT OF GRIEF AND IT APPEARS BASED ON NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LINES OF EVIDENCE THAT THAT RELATES TO THIS MOLECULE THAT SOME OF YOU AVE PROBABLY HEARD OF WHICH IS OXYTOSEN OXITOSIN IS A HORMONE SLASH PEPTIDE TO PEPTIJUS MEANS A PROTINE GENERALLY A SMALL PROTINE AND A HORMONE IS GENERALLY SOMETHING THAT FUNCTIONS THAT NUMEROUS LOCATIONS IN THE BODY TO IMPACT NUMEROUS ORGANS AND AIREAS OF THE BRAIN SO A PEPTIDE CAN BE A HORMONE AND A HORMONE CAN BE A PEPTIDE THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OXYTOSIN HAS A VARIETY OF ROLLS IN THE BRAIN ENBODY ITS INVOLVED IN MILK LEK DOWN DURING LACTATION ITS INVOLVED IN PERABONDING BOTH IN MALES AND FEMALES ITS INVOLVED IN BONDING OF PARENT TO CHILD AND INDEED BETWEEN ROMANTIC PARTNERS ET CETERA ET CETERA LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ANIMAL MODELS THAT INFORM US ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ROLS OF OXYTOSIN IN THE GRIEVING PROCESS THERE'S A SPECIES OF ANIMAL CALLED THE PRAIRIE VOLL AND BELIEVE IT ARE NOT THE PRAIRIE VOLL HAS BEEN STUDIED FAIRLY EXTENSIVELY BY NEROSINSON PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHERS FACT OUR FORMER DIRECTURE OF THE NATIUNAL INSTITUTES OF MENTAL HEALT TOMENSIL HIS LABORATORY FOCUST QUITE HEAVILY ON PRAIRIE VOLS PRAIE VOLLS ARE ONE SPECIES OF ANIMAL BUT DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE YOU FIND THAT SOME PRAIRIE VOLLS ARE MONOGAMIS THAT IS THEY MATE WITH THE SAME PRAIRIE VOLL FOR LIFE THEY RAISE LITTERS OF LITTLE PRAIRIE VOLLS FOR LIFE AND OTHER PRAIRIE VOLLS GENERALLY THAT LIVE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE WILD ARE NONMONOGMIS SOMETIMES CALLED POLYGAMIS THE NOR CHEMICALL AND CIRCUIT BASIS FOR THIS MONOGAMY VERSES NONMONOGMY QUITE INTERESTING HOWEVER IN THE CONTECT OF GRIEF AND ATTACHMENT THE PRAIRIE VOLS HAVE TAUGHT US A LOT AND THEY'VE TAUGHT AS A LOT THROUGH THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT TAKE TWO PRAIRIE VOLLS THAT ARE COUPLED UP SO THESE WOULD BE MONOGAMIS PRAIRIE VOLLS THAT OF ESTABLISHED A COUPLE THEM I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL THAT OF A PRAIRIE VOLDEM ANYWAY PUT THEM IN A CASE TOGETHER THEY MAKE TOGETHER THEY RAISE YOUNG TOGETHER AND THEN YOU SEPARATE THEM YOU LITERALLY PUT A PHYSICAL BARRIER BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND YOU CAN EVALUATE HOW STRONGLY ONE PRAIRIE VOLL WILL WORK TO GE T ACESS TO THE OTHER PRAIRIE VOLL RIGHT THIS IS SORT OF THE ROMEO AND JULIET OF PRAIRIE VOLL EXPERIMENTS AND WHAT YOU OBSERVE IS THAT THE MONOGAMS PRAIRIE VOLLS WILL WORK VERY HARD TO GET BACK TO THEIR MATE TO GET ACCESS TO THEIR MATE THEY WILL LEVER PRESS THEYLL EVEN WALK ACROSS A METAL PLATE THAT THEY GET A ELECTRICAL SHOCK THEY WILL WORK VERY VERY HARD THEY WILL CROSS RIVERS AND VALLEYS IF YOU WILL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL CONTECTS THAT IS THE POLYGAMIS PRAIRIE VOLLS AND AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW IF THEIR POLLY AMERIS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY FEEL RIGHT WE DON'TKOW IF THEY'RE IN LOVE OR I THEY'R MOTIVATED SIMPLY FOR OTHER THINGS BUT THE NONMONOGAMIS PRAIRIE VOLLS WI'LL NOT WORK AS HARD TO ACCESS A PRAIRIE VOLL PARTENER NOW YOU COULD ARGUE THAT'S BECAUSE THEY EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER PRAIRIE VOLL PARTNERS BUT EVEN IF THEY'VE NEVER EXPERIENCE ANOTHER PRAIRIE VOL PARTNER THEY WON'T WORK QUITE AS HARD TO GET BACK IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OTHER PRAIRIE VOLL TO MATE ER OTHERWISE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE INTERESTING WHEN YOU START TO EXPLORE THE PATTERNS OF SO CALLED OXYTOAN RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT AND TO ALSO BRIDGE TO THE HUMAN LITERATURE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE MONOGAMIS PRAIRIE VOLLS HAVE FAR MORE OXYTOSAN RECEPTERS IN THIS BRAIN AREA THAT MENTIONED EARLIER THE NUCLIUS ACCUMBENTS AND AGAIN TO REMIND YOU THE NUCLIUS E CUMBENS AS THE BRAINAREA ASSOCIATED WITH MOTIVATION CRAVING AND PURSUIT SO IT'S AS IF THE MONOGAMIS PRAIRIE VOLLS HAVE A CAPACITY TO LINK THE ATTACHMENT CIRCUITRY AND THE MOLECULES OF ATTACHMENT IN THIS CASE OXYTOSON TO REWARD PATHWAYS AND TO MOTIVATIONAL PATHWAYS POLYGAMIS OR WE SHOULD SAY NONMONOGYMOUS PRAIRIE OLLS DO AS WELL HOWEVER THEY HAVE LESS OXYTOS AN RECEPTOR SO IN OTHER WORDS NONMONOGAMIS PRAIRIE VOLLS SEEM TO HAVE LESS YEARNING FOR ATTACHMENT OVER ALL AT LEAST TO A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL PRAIRIE VOLL AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HUMAN LITERATURE IN TERMS OF OXYTOS AN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION AND BRAIN IMAGING EXPERIMENTS AND SO ON WE YOU FIND IS THE SAME THET PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE INTENSE GRIEF AND A DEEP YEARNING AND A MOTIVATION TO RECONNECT WITH THE PERSON ANIMAL OR THING THAT IS LOST IN MANY CASES HAVE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF OXYTOSIN SPECIFICALLY WHEREI SHOULD SAY OXYTOSAN RECEPTORS TO BE EXACT SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE BRAIN REGIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CRAVING AND PURSUIT SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT FIND YOURSELF IN THIS KIND OF STUCK MODE THIS PERSISTENCE OF TRYING TO REACH INTO THE PAST OR WISHFUL THINKING THIS A COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING IF ONLY IF ONLY IF ONLY YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO PYTHOLOGIZE THAT THINKING FIRST OF ALL WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A D APTIVE AND IN FACT IN THE COMPLETE LOSS OF SOMEBODY OR IF SOMEBODY SAYS THEY DON'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU EVER AGAIN BY ALL MEANS YOU KNOW IF THAT'S EXPRESSED CLEARLY THAN YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT REALITY BUT THE YEARNING THE DESIRE AND THE IMPULSIVITY THE LEANING IN AND AT A ALMOST REFLECTIVE WAY TO TRY AN ACCESS THAT PERSON AGAIN TO TEXT THEM TO WANT A HEAR FROM THEM COULD AND I HAVE TO HILIKE COULD REFLECT THE FACT THAT YOU JUST SO HAPPEN HAVE MORE OXYTOSAN RECEPTORS OR MAY BE MORE OXYTOSAN OVER ALL IN THIS BRAIN AREA THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH MOTIVATION AND PURSUIT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU ARE MORE CAPABLE OF ATTACHMENT THAN PEOPLE WHO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF MORE QUICKLY AND I SHOULD SAY THAT PEOPLE MOVE THROUGH GRIEF AT DIFFERENT RATES EVEN IF TWO PEOPLE LOST THE SAME PERSON OR SAME ANIMAL PEOPLE MOVE THROUGH THIS AT DIFFERENT RATES AND SOME OF THAT IS NO DOUBT PSYCHOLOGICAL BUT SOME OF IT NO DOUBT IS ALSO NEURO CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL AND IN SHURING THIS WITH YOU I HOPE IT SHED SOME UNDERSTANDING AND PERHAPS EVEN SOME COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING THROUGH THINGS MORE QUICKLY OR IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND OF COURSE IT SHOULD ALSO I WOULD HOPE SHED COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING FOR PEOPLE THAT SEEM INCAPABLE OF QUOTIN UOE MOVING ON IT'S TAKING THEM FAR LONGER TO MOVE ON EARLI ARE WE TALKED ABOUT COMPLICATED GRIEF NON COMPLICATED GRIEF AND PROLONGED GRIEF DISORDER AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THE PRECISE DIVISIONS BETWEEN THESE CATEGORIES IS NOT VERY PRECISE IT TAKES A REALLY TRAINED EXPERT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY IS IN THE PROLONGED GRIEF DISORDER CATEGORY COMPLICATE OR NON COMPLICATED GRIEF IS I SHEAT A SET OF QUESTION AIRS THAT I INVITE YOU TO ANSWER IF YOU LIKE I THEY WERE PROVIDED I I SHOULD SAY I ACCESS THEM THROUGH A PUBLIC SIGHT ON MARY FRANCIS O CONERS WEBPAGE WILL PUT THEM IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTION YOU AC SHE CAN SUBMIT THOSE ANSWERS IN AN ANONYMOUS WAY TO A STUDY THAT SHE'S DOING SHE HAS SEVERAL SURVEYS ONE FOR LOSS OF A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP OTHER FOR LOSS DUE TO DEATH OF SOMEBODY AND STILL ANOTHER ONE THAT RELATES TO HOMESICKNESS AND IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SO PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT WEBSIDES VERY EASY TO DOWNLOW THERE'S NO COSTS TO THAT AT ALL YOU CON CONTRIBUTE TO THE SCIENTIFIC A DATO CLLECTION PROCESS IF YOU LIKE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU GET YOUR A SCORES BACK OR AN INTERPRECTATION OF YOUR SCORES AN BY PARTICIPATING THERE WHEN MARY FRANCIS OCONER HOPEFULLY COMES ON THE PODCAST SHE CAN TELL US SOME MORE OF THE DETAIL ABOUT SEPARATING OUT THIS PROLONGED GRIEF DISORDER COMPLICATED NON COMPLICATED GRIEF BUT IN THE MEANTIME IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT PEOPLE MOVE THROURH GRIEF AT DIFFERENT RATES AND AS I MENTION JUST A MOMENT AGO THAT THIS IS ENTIRELY NORMAL PROBLY HAS A BASIS AND NOR CHEMICALS AND HORMONE SUCH AS OXYTOSON THERRE PROBABLY OTHER REASONS AS WELL IN FACT WE CAN ASSUME WITH ALMOST CERTAINTY THAT THERE ARE OTHER REASONS AS WELL NONE THE LESS I TH NK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT HIGH SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME MOVING THROUGH GRIEF DUE TO LIFE CIRCUMSTANCE INNATE DIFFERENCES AND SO ON THERE'S A VERY NICE SET OF STUDIES BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR INTITLED CATACOLAMINE PREDICTORS OF COMPLICATED GRIEF OUTCOMES HERE AGAIN THE FIRST AUTHOR IS MARY FRANCIS OCONER REMINDING US THAT SHE HAS DONE SO MUCH IMPORTANT WORK IN THE SAREA THIS PAPER HAS SEVERAL CONCLUSIONS BUT ONE OF THE KEY CONCLUSIONS IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR CATEGORY MOLECULES WE CALL THE CATACOLA MENES THE CATACOLAMENS INCLUDE EPINEFRON WHICH IS ALSO A DRENALINE NOR EPINEFRON WHICH IS NORADRENALINE AND DOPOMINE WHICH YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT BEFORE HERE I AM JUST AN A PARAPHRASE WHILE REDIRECTLY ACTUALLY WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT PARTICIPANCS AGAIN THIS IS HUMAN SUBJECTS WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF EPINEPERAN OF A DRENALINE PRETREATMENT HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF COMPLICATED GRIEF SYMPTOMS POST TREATMENT AND THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THEIR BASELINE LEVEL OF SYMPTOMS WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE THAVE A LOT OF CIRCULATING A DRENALINE WE MIGHT EVEN CALL THESE PEOPLE W O PEOPLE WHO ARE OR TYPICALLY RESIDE AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AN WE HAVE AN AUTONOMIC NERVOU SYSTEM THAT IT TAKES HOW CALM OR ALERT OR STREST WE HAPPEN TO BE JUST AT BASELINE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO BE MORE ALERT AND ANXIOUS THAT BASELINE PRIOR TO ANY GRIEF EPISODE TEND TO HAVE OR STATITICALLY ON AVERAGE WE SHOULD SAY ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE COMPLICATED GRIEF AND MAY BEVEN PROLONGED GRIEF SYMPTOMS SO FEUR SOMEBODY THAT IS ANTICIPATING LOSING SOME ONE OR AN ANIMAL OR A THING AT SOME POINT AND I THINK THAT REALLY MEANS EVERYBODY YUTILIZING TOOLS TO A JUST YOUR EPINEPRON YOUR DRENALINE LEVELS DOWN HAS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT BENEFITS IMPROVING SLEEP HEALTH METRIC ET CETERA THERE ARE TOOLS TO DO THAT WE HAVE AN EPISODE ON MASTERING STRESS THAT YOU CAN FINED AT OUR WEBSITE HUMRAN LAV NOT CALM HAS A LOT OF BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THAT AR BACKED BY SCIENCE SOME OF WORK THAT WAS DONE IN MY LABORATORY BUT OTH CERTAINLY OTHER LABORATORIES AS WELL THAT WILL LAUE TO CONTROL YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BOTH IN REAL TIME AND REDUCE THE OVERALL LEVEL OF STRESS AND EVEN CHRONIC ACTIVATION OF THE SOCILED SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS JUST FANCY GEEK SPEAK FOR SAYING THERE ARE TOOLS TO HELP YOU BE CALM NOT JUST FOR SAKE OF NAVIGATING DAILY STRESS BUT AS THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES FOR ANTICIPATING THE FACT THAT AT SOME POINT YOU WILL LOSE SOMEBODY AND ANIMAL OR A THING AND THERE IS A WAY TO MOVE THROUGH THAT PROCESS THAT WE CALL HEALTHY NORMAL GRIEVING AND THEN THERE'S THE SO CALL COMPLICATED GRIEF FOR PROLONGED GRIEF DISORDERS THAT REFLECT IMMENSE CHALLENGE IN MOVING THROUGH GRIEF AT A REASONABLE RATE SO YOU CAN SOMEWHAT INOCULATE YOURSELF AGAINST COMPLICATED OR PROLONGED GRIEF BY REDUCING YOUR RESTING LEVELS OF WERE YOUR PRE LOST LEVELS OF EPONEFRNT OF A DRENALINE AND AGAIN THEIR EXCELLENT TOOLS TO DO THAT WON'T REVIEW THEM HERE FOR SAKE OF TIME BUT THEIR TIMESTAMPTON YOU CAN ACSESS THOSE EASILY AGAIN ZERO COSTOOLS GOING BACK TO THIS PAPER CATACOL MEAN PREDICTORS OF COMPLICATED GRIEF TREATMENT OUTCOMES SHOULD SAY THAT NOT ONLY DID PARTICIPANTS OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF A DRENALIN HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF COMPLICATED GRIEF SYMPTOMS POST TREATMENT BUT THE PREDICTIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO THINGS A DRENALINE AND COMPLICATED GRIEF WAS NOT SEEN IN DEPRESSION AND I FIND THAT INCREDIBLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT FURTHER SEPARATES DEPRESSION FROM GRIEVING AND GRIEVING FROM DEPRESSION  A RESOUNDING THEME AGAIN AND AGAIN GRIEVING IS NOT DEPRESSION AND DEPRESSION IS NOT NECESSARILY GRIEVING THEY CAN COEXIST BUT THEY ARE SEPARABLE AS WELL AND INDEED REFLECT SEPARATE BRAIN CIRCUITRIES ENTIRELY SO THE CONCLUSION THAY DRAWS THAT THE PRESENT STUDYES SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CATACOLAMEN LEVELS AGAIN EPANEFFER AN DOPAME NORP ANEFFRET OR THE CATACL MEANS AR AFFECTED BY BEREVEMENT AND IN TURN CAN AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THOSE COMWITH COMPLICATED GRIEF TO BENEFIT FROM PSYCHOTHERAPY SO WHATDOES AL THIS MEAN WHAT THIS MEANS IS WE CAN PREPARE OURSELVES TO BE IN A BETTER STATE TO ACCESS YES ACCESS GRIEF WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE AND INDEED GRIEF IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WHEN WE LOSE SOME ONE AN ANIMAL OR A THING THAT WE ARE CLOSELY ATTACHED TO AND YET TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THAT AT A PACE AND IN A WAY THAT IS MOST ADAPTIVE FOR US AND TO JUST AGAIN HIGHLIGHT WHAT ADAPT ID MEANS IT DOES NOT MEAN DISSOCIATING FROM THE ATTACHMENT TO THE PERSON ANIMAL OR THING I JUST WONT A PAUSE FOR SECOND AND MENTION WHY I KEEP REPEATING PERSON ANIMAL OR THING I'M SAYING THAT BECAUSE WHILE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF A PERSON OR A RELATIONSHIP WITH A PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THROUGH DEATH OF COURSE BUT DEATH OR OTHERWISE THIS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL CAN INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND EVEN IF WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCED IT WE ARE CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING GREAT ATTACHMENTS TO ANIMALS AS WELL AND WHILE THE LOSS OF A THING OF AN OBJECT IN NO WAYSHAPOR FORM APPROXIMATES THE LOSS OF A PERSON OR AN ANIMAL WOULD NEVER SUGGESTS THAT IT DOES IT WOULD ALSO BE NAIVEAND UNFAIR OF ME OR ANYONE ELSE TO SUGGESTS THAT THINGS CAN'T HOLD TEMENSE IT IMPORTANCE TO US AND THAT THE LOSS OF THEM CAN FEEL QUITE SIGNIFICANT AND INVOKE THE GRIEVING PROCESS THIS ISN'T ALWAYS ABOUT MATERIALISM SOMETIMES IT'S PURELY ABOUT THE SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT SO FOR INSTANCE THE LOSS OF A WEDDING RING OR AN ENGAGEMENT RING THAT WAS VERY MEANINGFUL TO YOU OR AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING OR A PAINTING OR EVEN A SMALL SEEMINGLY INIMPORTANT OBJECT TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT SOMETHING THAT HELD GREAT MEANING TO YOU MAY BE A SEASHELL THAT YOU COLLECTED WITH SOMEBODY ON THE BEACH AND THEN SOMEHOW IT GETS LOST AND IT'S THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT PERSON THAT'S CONTAINED WITHIN THAT OBJECT FOR YOU AS IT AS A REPRESENTATION WITHIN THAT OBJECT THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT'S THE REASON WHY I KEEP SAYING PERSON ANIM L OR THING I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR TO INCLUDE THINGS IN THAT CATEGORY BUT OF COURSE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY DON'T HOLD THE ABSOLUTE SAME MAGNITUDE AS THE LOSS OF A BEING ONE THING THAT WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT IS WHETHER OR NOT THE DEPTH OF ATTACHMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO SOMEBODY PREDICTS HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE FOR YOU TO MOVE THROUGH THE LOSS OF THAT PERSON WE OFTEN HEAR THIS A ACTUALLY I CAN REMEMBER SOME YEARS AGO AT THE END OF A RELATIONSHIP A A FRIEND IN COLLEAGUE OF MIND SAYING YOU KNOW FOR EVERY YEAR THAT YOU WERE TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU ONE MONTH TO GET OVER THAT PERSON AD I THOUGHT WHERE IN THE WORLD OF THOSE DATA COME FROM A AND THIS IS WHAT I CALL ANEC DATA OR COLLECTIVE DATA WHERE A THIS IS LIKE PHRASES SUCH AS ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER AND INDEED SOMETIMES ABSENCE CAN MAKE THE HEART GROW FONDER IN THE CONTECT OF TWO LIVING PEOPLE OR PEOPLE IN THE LOVING RELATIONSHIP OR EVEN IN THE CONTECTS OF GRIEF AND LOSS BUT OF COURSE THEIRE'S ABSENCE MAKES THE HARTGROW FONDER AND THEN YOU ALSO WILL HEAR OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND AND IF YOU'E BEEN LISTENING TO THIS EPISODE CLEARLY OUT OF SIGHT DOES NOT MEAN OUT OF MIND OR OUT OF EMOTIONAL CONNECTION SO THESE SAYINGS OF WILE IT TAKES EX NUMBER OF MONTHS FOR NUMBER OF YEARS OR OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND OR ABSENCE MAKES THE HART GROW FONDER A THEY REALLY DON'T HOLD A LOT OF MEANING AT LEAST NOT FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHO LIKE SCIENCE BECAUSE SCIENCE IS AT LEAST A GEARED TOWARD OR AIMS TOWARDS ESTABLISHHING THINGS IN FACT NOT OPINION BUT ALSO BECAUSE SCIENCE ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE PREDICTIONS IT ALLOWS YOU TO ORIENT YOURSELF IN A PROCESS AND MAKE PREDICTIONS AND UNDERSTAND SO WHAT ARE WE TO THINK OF PEOPLE WHO SEEM TVERY VERY ATTACHED TO SOMEBODY THEY BREAK UP AND THEY SEEM JUST CRUSH DEVASTATED BUT THREE WEEKS LATER THERE IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND THEY SEEM PERFECTLY FINE OR SOMEBODY WHO SPOUSE DIES AND THEN SUDDENLY THERE IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP I THINK THERE ARE RATES OF TRANSITION IF YOU WILL THAT SUGGEST SOME A THIS FUNCTION PATHOLOGY ET CETERA BUT HERE WE AREN'T IN A POSITION TO JUDGE WERE ONLY IN A POSITION TO SPECULATE ABOUT THIS AND I THINK WE CAN REASONABLY SPECULATE THAT IT SORT OF MAKE SENSE WHY SOMEONE WHO HAS AN INTENSE ATTACHMENT TO SOMEBODY MIGHT BE ABLE TO FORM A TENSE ATTACHMENTS GENERALLY RIGHT THAT THEY AREN'T RESTRICTED TO ONE PERSON WHERE AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE AN INTENSE ATTACHMENT TO SOMEBODY MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES ENTIRELY INCAPABLE OF MOVING ON OR IT WOULD TAKE THEM A VERY LONG TIME HENCE THE LINES IN THE FINEMEN LETTER T ARE LEAN ABOUT HE HAD MET VARIOUS OTHER YOUNG WOMEN THEY SEEM PERFECTLY NICE AND YET THEY WERE MEANINGLESS TO HIM IN THE SHADOW OF HER MEMORY OR WE SHOULD SAY IN THE LIGHT OF OURLEAN'S MEMORY OR THE MEMORY OF ORLEAN RATHER SO THESE DIMENTIONALITIES OF ATTACHMENT THEY CAUGHT IN EVERY DIRECTION AND I DON'T THINK ANY WELL TRAINED PSYCHOLOGIST OR NERAL SCIENTISTS WHATEVER SAY OH IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO BE COMES VERY ATTACHED THEREFORE IT'S VERY HARD TO MOVE ON I THINK THAT COULD BE TRUE IT COULD ALSO BE THAT IF YOU RE SOMEBODY HAS A GREAT CAPACITY FOR ATTACHMEN YOU HAVE A GREAT CAPACITY FOR ATTACHMENT OVER ALL NERA SCIENCE NOR SYCHOLOGY IS REALLY IN A POSITION TO JUDGE CERTAINLY BUT S ALSO NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF PREDICTIONS AT LEAST THE FIELD AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW OF ATTACHMENT IND GRIEVING CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO WHY THAT'S THE CASE SO THAT'S MY ATTEMPT TO DEPATHOLOGIZE SOME OF WHAT WE OBSERVE ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO CONFESS ON FROM A JUST SORT OF A EVERYDAY STANCE THAT ASOMETIMES THE RATE IN WHICH PEOPLE MOVE OUT OF ATTACHMENTS AND GRIEVING ON CAN BE SOMEWHAT ERIE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT AND EXPLORE THIS IDEA THAT ALLOWING OURSELVES TO REALLY FEEL THE ATTACHMENT TO SOMEBODY CAN ECCELERATE OR AT LEAST SUPPORT ADAPTIVE TRANSITIONING THROUGH GRIEF IS A REALLY WONDERFUL STUDY THAT ON THE FACE OF IT APPEARS TO BE A WHAT WE CALL NEGATIVE RESULT A NEGATIVE RESULT IS WHEN A HYPOTHESIS IS POSED AND THEN TURNS OUT THE HYPOTHESIS IS NOT TRUE BUT AS IS THE CASE WIT SO MANY INTERESTING SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS OFTEN WHEN THERE'S A NEGATIVE RESULT THEREIS A MORE INTERESTING RESULT NESTED IN THAT NEGATIVE OUTCOME AND THIS IS THE CASE IN A PARTICULAR PAPER I'LL SHARE WITH YOU NOW THIS A PAPER PUBLISH IN THE GERNAL BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND AGAIN THE TITLE IS POSED AS A QUESTION WHICH IS EMOTIONAL DISCLOSURE FOR WHOM A STUDY OF VAGAL TONE IN BERIEVEMENT WHAT THE STUDY EXPLORED WAS WHETHER OR NOT WRITTEN DISCLOSURE OF THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO SOMEBODY THAT WAS LOST WOULD BE EFFECTIVE AS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS THE STUDY ALSO EXPLORED THE SO CALLED VAGUEST NERVE THE VAGUEST NERVE IS AN EXTENSIVE NERVE PATHWAY THAT IS BY DIRECTIONAL BETWEEN BRAIN AND BODY SO BRAIN TO BODY AND BODY TO BRAIN IT GENERALLY IS ASSOCIATED WITH CALMING EFFECTS ON OUR BRAIN ENBODY ALTHOUGH THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS HEART RATE AN HEARTRATE VERIABILITY AN IN VERY SYMPLISTIC TERMS IF YOUR HEART WAS JUST ALLOWED TO BEAT AT ITS SOR DEFAULT RATE THAT RATE WOULD BE RATHER HIGH BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVATION OF THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE ALERTNESS COMPONENT OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE PARI SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AS IT'S CALLED INVOLVES CALMING WE SOMETIMES YORE SYMPATHETIC IS FOR STRESS OR FIGHTER FLIGHT THROU A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL I SHOULD MENTION AND IS NOT FOR SYMPATHY SYMPE SIMPLY MEANS TO GETHER AND IT REFLECTS THE ACTIVITY OF A BUNCH OF NURONS BEING ACTIVE AT THE SAME TIME OR TO GATHER SYMPA WHEREAS PARI SYMPATHETIC IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH QUOTING QUOTE REST IN DIGEST FUNCTIONS OR CALMING FUNCTIONS ALTHOUGH IT IS CERTAINLY INVOLVED AN OTHER THINGS AS WELL SO SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DRIVES ALERTNESS PANIC STRESS ET CETERA PARI SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM MEANING AT DISTINCT SET OF NERON'S DRIVE CALMING FALLING A SLEEP DIGESTION SEXUAL AROUSAL FOR THAT MATTER AND SO ON SE SO ARE LIKE A SEA SAW OF A LERTNESS AND CALM ALERTNESS AND CALM SYMPATHETIC COMPARI SYMPATHETIC BACK AND FORTH THE VAGUEST NERVE IS GENERALLY ASSOCIATE WITH PARISYMPATHETIC FUNCTIONS AND HAS THE CAPACITY TO SLOW DOWN OUR HEART RATE IN PARTICULAR BY EXHALS AND JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE DIAPHRAME IN ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE HEART IN THE THORACIC CAVITY EXHALS RESULT IN SLOWING DOWN OF THE HEART RATE THIS IS WHAT WE CALL IN INCREASED VAGAL TONE SO LETME EXPLAIN FOR A MOMENT AND ACTUHLY HEARS A TOOL YOU CAN USE NOT JUST IN TERMS OF NAVIGATING GRIEF BUT INTERMS OF STRESS MODULATION GENERALLY WE HAVE A MUSCLE CALLED THE DIAPHRAME WHEN WE INHAL WHETHER NOT THROUGH OUR MOUTH OR  NOS OR DIAPHRAME MOVES DOWN AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE IS MORE SPACE OVER ALL IN THE THORACI CAVITY HEART GETS A LITLEBAT BIGER BELIEVE IT ARE NOT VOLUMEWISE BLOOD FLOWS MORE SLOWLY THROUGH THAT LARGE VOLUME AND THERE'S A SIGNAL CONVEYED FROM THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO THE HEART TO SPEED THE HEART UP SO INHALES LITERALLY SPEED YOUR HART UP AND WHEN YOU EXHAL THE DIAPHRAME MOVES UP AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE'S LESS SPACE IN THE THRACICAVITY  HEART GETS LOBIT SMALLER THE EXISTING BLOOD VOLUME IN THE HEART AT THAT TIME MOVES MORE QUICKLY THROUGH THAT SMALL VOLUME RIGHT GIVEN AMOUNT OF BLOOD VOLUME MAKE THE COMPARTMENTITS IN THE EART SMALER AND THE BLOOD MOVES MORE QUICKLY THROUGH THAT VOLUME AND AS A CONSEQUENCE O THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE HEART VIA THE VAGUEST AND OTHER PATHWAYS TO SLOW THE HEART DOWN ANOTHER WORDS EXHAL SLOW THE HEART DOWN THAT PROCESS THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INHALES SPEEDING THE HART UP AND EXHAL SLOWING THE HEART DOWN I SOMETHING CALL RESPITORY SCINESS A RHYTHMEA SOME PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE RESPITORY SCINESCS A RHYTHMEA MORE NATURALLY MORE REFLECTIVELY THAN OTHERS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRAIN THIS BY CONSCIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT SLOWING YOUR HART RATE WHILE YOU EXHAL AND CONSCIOUSLY THINGING ABOUT INCREASING YOUR HEART RATE AS YOU INHALE YOU CAN LITERALLY STRENGTHEN THESE PATHWAYS NOW RESPIATORY SCIENCE A RHYTHMEA AND THE ABILITY TO SLOW YOUR HEART RATE WITH EXHALS IS ONE DIMENSION OF WHAT'S CALLED VAGAL TONE OR YOUR ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR OVER ALL LEVEL OF ACTIVATION OF ALERTNESS AND STRESS WITH THESE VAGUEST NERVE PATHWAYS SO VAGAL TONE IS SOMETHING THAT VARIES FROM PERSON A PERSON IF YOU'VE TRAINED UP OR YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BREATH AND HEART RATE YOU CAN IMPROVE VAGAL TONE SOME PEOPLE HAVE VERY ROBUST VAGAL TONE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANY TRAINING OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LESS OF IT ET CETERA I'LL JUST PARAPHRASE FROM THIS PAPER AND YOU'LL SEE WHERE THIS TAKES US IN TERMS OF NAVIGATING GRIEF BECAUSE IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THE VAGEST NERVE PROVIDES IN HIBITORY REGULATORY INFLUENCE ON THE HEART ALLOWING THE HART RATE TO INCREASE RAPIDLY THROUGH VAGAL WITHDRAWAL THAT MEANS CANCOMING OFF THE BRAK OF THE PAR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AS IN RESPONSE TO A STRESSER IN ONE'S ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOUARE STRESSED YOU RARELY TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY IF IT'S A AN IMMEDIATE STRESS OR THREAT TO ACTIVELY EXHAIL THAT WULD BE GREAT TOOL TO USE IN FACT WE PROMOTE THAT TOOL IN OUR MASTERING STRESS EPISODE TAGAL WICHRALL USUALLY COOCCURS WITH AN INCREASE IN SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION OF THE HEART YOU NOW KNOW WHAT THAT IS OR IS KNOWN AS THE FIGHTERFLIGHT RESPONSE VAGAL TONE REFLECTS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THERE IS TONIC MEANING ON GOING VAGAL INFLUENCE ON THE HEART SO WHEN YOU HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF VAGAL TONE IT MEANS THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS ACTIVATING THAT BREAK ON YOUR STRESS SYSTEM JUST AT DEFAULT AND SOMEPEOPLE JUST HAPPEN TO DO THAT MORE OTHER PEOPLE NEED TO PRACTICE LONG EXALE BREATHING IN ORDER TO BUILD UP VAGAL TONE SOMETHING IT'S VERY USEFUL TO DO WHETHER YOUR GRIEVING OR NOT NOW IN THIS STUDY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY HAD PEOPLE AND I SHOULD SAY IT WAS THIRTY FIVE PARTICIPANTS GO THROUGH A WRITING EXERCISE FOR A PERIOD OF WEEKS THET SH WROTE ABOUT THREE TIMES PER WEEK THEN THERE WAS A FOLLOW UP AT SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN AGAIN ABOUT A MONTH LATER AND THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS ONE GROUP WAS IN THE SO CALLED WRITTEN DISCLOSURE GROUP WHAT THEY DID AS THEY ON DEY ON THEY WOULD WRITE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN A LOVED ONE DIED AND INDEED THEY USE PEOPLE WHO HAD EXPERIENCED REAL LOST AND SO THEY WERE ASKED TO TALK ABOUT AND WRITE ABOUT THEIR DEEPEST EMOTIONS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT IT MEMORIES OF THEIR LOVED ON VERY INTENSE STUFF IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF THEYRE IN THE IMMEDIATE PERIOD OF HAVING LOST SOME ONE THEN THEY ACTUALLY WERE ASKED TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE PERSON THAT THEY LOST SO AGAIN A VERY INTENSE EXERCISE I'M TO GO THROUGH IF YOU DID INDEED LOSE SOMEBODY AS THESE SUBJECTS HAD AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE TESTING SOME PERIATIVE TIME LATER AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THAT PERIOD BUT WHAT THAT TESTING INVOLVED THE OTHER GROUP WAS THE SOCAL CONTROL GROUP WHERE THEY WERE SIMPLY TOLD TO WRITE ABOUT HOW THEY USE THEIR TIME SO AN EMOTIONALLY KIND OF EMPTY WRITING EXERCISE IF YOU WILL THEY DESCRIBED WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO DAY AFTER THEY WOKE UP AT CETERA NO NO HEAVY EMOTIONAL CONTENT AND SO ON NOW AS I MENTION EARLIER THE IMMEDIATE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WERE A NEGATIVE RESULT MEANING NO EFFECT THE DISCLOSURE THET WE SHOULD SAY THE EMOTIONALLY INTENSE WRITING GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT DIFFER AT BASE LINE ON ANY SYMPTOMEASURES OR PSYCHOLOGICAL VERIABLES THEY TELL US AND AT LEAST THAT FACE VALUE SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTINGLY THERE REALLY WASN'T ANY KIND OF DIFFERENCE IN OUTCOME BETWEEN THE GROUP THAT WROTE ABOUT A VERY EMOTIONAL INTENSE STUFF FOR SIS NON EMOTIONALLY INTENTS NOW WHAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU THUS FAR IS WHY THEY HAD THEM DO THIS EXERCISE AT ALL THEY HADE THEM DO THIS EXERCISE BECAUSE MANY OF THE EFFECTIVE PRACTICES FOR MOVING THROUGH GRIEF INVOLVE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER GETTING CLOSE TO AND ACTUALLY DELIBERATELY EXPERIENCING THE ATTACHMENT THAT ONE HAS TO THAT PERSON THAT WAS LOST NOT DISTRACTING ONES SELF NOT GETTING INTO THIS COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING THE WHAT IF WHAT IF WHAT IF BUT RATHER THINKING ABOUT HER IN THIS CASE WRITING ABOUT THE REAL ATTACHMENT AND SO THAT THE INITIAL IDEA WAS IF PEOPLE RIGHT ABOUT THIS ATTACHMENT THAT THEY'RE GING EXPERIENCE THIS ATTACHMENT AND THAT WILL SERVE THEM IN SOME ARE MANY WAYS INTERMS OF MOVING THROUGH GRIEF AND THAT WASN'T WHAT THEY FOUND THEY FOUND NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS UNTIL THEY EXPLORED WHO HAD HIGHER VAGAL TONE WHO HAD A GREATER DEGREE OF SO CALLED RESPIATORY SINESS AY RHYTHMEA IN OTHER WORDS WHO WAS ABLE TO MODULATE THEIR STATE USING THEIR BREATHING AN THEIR BODY AND WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WAS THAT A SUBSET OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD A HIGH DEGREE OF VAGAL TONE SEEM TO GET MORE BENEFIT FROM THIS WRITING TYPE EXERCISE NOW THIS IS ONE STUDY AND I WOULD CONSIDERITE FAIRLY PRELIMINARY WITH THIRTY FIVE SUBJECTS ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IT'S A STUDY IN TO ITSELF AN I THINK AT QUITE NICE ONE AND IT REALLY SET THE STAGE FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER STUDIES THAT FOLLOWED FROM THIS GROUP AN OTHER GROUPS THAT REALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT YES INDEED ACCESSING THE STATES OF EMOTIONALITY BY RITING OR THINKING ABOUT SOMEBODY IS QUITE POWERFUL IN TERMS OF ENGAGING THE BODILY STATES IN THE MIND STATES ASSOCIATE WITH THE ATTACHMENT AND THAT IS VERY BENEFICIAL FOR MOVING THROUGH GRIEF THAT IS VERY BENEFICIAL FOR SENSING THE ATTACHMENT AND NOW IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AS TO WHY SOME PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT SORT OF PRACTICE MORE THAN OTHERS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS MORE REAL SOMATIC FEELINGS OF ATTACHMENT BY WRITING ABOUT THE ATTACHMENT OR BY THINKING ABOUT IT THAN OTHERS SO THIS BRINGS US BACT TO AN EARLIER DISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING WERE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO MOVE THROUGH THINGS VERY QUICKLY OR DON'T SEEM TO BE GRIEVING CONSTANTLY AND A I YOU KNOW A SPOUSE OR A FAMILY MEMBER OF THAT PERSON MIGHT THINK CASHA WHY AREN'T YOU UPSET HOW IS IT THAT YOU CAN BE FUNCTIONAL WHEN I'M NOT OR HOW IS THEY CAN BE FUNCTIONAL THERE CAN EVEN BE ON FRACTURES IN FAMILIES AND RELATIONSHIPS ON THE BASIS OF DIFFERENCES AND RATES OF GRIEVING AND SO ON WELL SOME OF THIS AGAIN PROBLY RELATES TO PSYCHOLOGY IN THE DIFFERENT ATTACHMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAD TO THE PERSON OR ANIMAL OR THING THAT WAS LOST BUT IT NO DOUBT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH HOW MUCH OF A MIND BODY CONNECTION HOW MUCH VAGAL TONE EXIST IN THE PERSON WHEN THEY SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE GRIEF EPISODE SO THIS ACTUALLY OFFERS MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES IF YOURE SOMEBODY FOR INSTANCE WHO IS GREEVING SO INTENSELY AND SO OFTEN THAT YOUR FINDING IT IMMENSELY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF AT A REASONABLE RATE AND YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY OR FIND YOURSELF DIAGNOTES WITH PROLONGED GRIEF DISORDER OR WITH COMPLICATED GRIEF SENTRIMENT AWAY THAT'S REALLY IN IMPAIRING YOUR ADAPTED FUNCTIONING IN LIFE WILL THEN IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME AT LEAST BY MY READ OF THE DATA THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO ENGAGE IN A LOT OF PRACTICES TO INCREASE THE MIND BODY RELATIONSHIP AND FEELING SO MUCH OF THIS ATTACHMENT BECAUSEYOU'RE ALREADY FEELING AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF IT WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE FEELING CHALLENGE IN ACCESSING THE FEELINGS OF ATTACHMENT AND PERHAPS NOT FUNCTIONING WELL AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT MIGHT FIND THAT PRACTICING BREATHING IN ORDE R TO ENCOURAGE RESPIATORY SCIENCE TO A RHYTHMA AGAIN FOCUSSING ON SLOWING YOUR HEART RATE CONSCIOUSLY WHILE YOU EXAL AND CONCENTRATING ON INCREASING YOUR HEART RATE AS YOU INHAL EVEN JUST AS A BRIEF PRACTICE OF EVEN JUST ONE TO THREE MINUTES ARE ONE TO FIVE MINUTES EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE OR PER DAY THAT COULD BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL IN BUILDING THIS MINE BODY RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE AGAIN WHAT THIS PAPER RALLY POINTS TO AND SET OFF A NUMBER OF OTHER INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO IS THAT FOR THOSE THAT CAN REALLY FEEL THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BREATHING HEART RATE WHAT WE CALL VAGAL TONE WELL THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE DISENGAGING FROM THE FEELINGS OF ATTACHMENT BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE BETTER ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FEELINGS OF ATTACHMENT SO WHAT THIS RELATES TO OF COURSE IS THAT TRY PARTIGHT MAP THAT THREE PART MAP THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT REPRESENTATION OF SPACE WHERE THINGS ARE WHERE THE PERSON IS WHERE THEIRE BELONGINGS ARE WHERE THEIR CAR IS WHERE THEIR BICYCLE IS TIME WHEN YOU EXPECTING TO SEE THEM ON OUR REGULAR BASIS WHEN THEY WOULD CALL WHEN THEY WOULD COME HOME FROM WORK ET CETERA AND THAT THIRD NOTE OR THAT THIRD DIMENSION OF ATTACHMENT WHICH IS LITERALLY ATTACHMENT AND CLOSENESS WELL WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS ANCHORING TO THAT ATTACHMENT AND REALLY FEELING IN TO THAT BUT THEN DISENGAGING FROM THE SPACE AND TIME MAP THAT WE CALL EPISODIC MEMORY THAT MENOU OF PRIOR EXPERIENCES THAT KEEPS US IN MANY WAYS MALEDAPTIDLY IN AN EXPECTATION OF WHAT NEVER CAN BE AGAIN NOW IT LIKT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND CONSIDER SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THAT SUPPORT HEALTHY TRANSITIONING THROUGH GRIEF AND THESE ARE TOOLS DISTINCT FROM THAT NURL MAP THAT SPACE TIME CLOSENESS ATTACHMENT MAP THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE RATHER IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT EVERYTHING EXISTS IN A CONTEXT OF OUR BASELINE PHYSIOLOGY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT CAN BE THE FIRST OR THE LAST TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE LEARNING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL AROUND OUR HEALTH IN EVERY WAY AMUNE SYSTEM ET CETERA FUNCTION FAR BETTER WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING REALLY WELL AND WHEN WE ARE GENERALLY AWAKTURING THE DAY TIME AND A SLEEP AT NIGHT I REALIZE THEIR SHIFT WORKERS OUT THERE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAVELLING IN OUR JET LAGED FOR SOMELL THANK YOU SHIFT WORKERS WE RELY ON YOU WE HAVE AN EPISODE ALL ABOUT JETLAGAN SHIFT WORK FOR YOU AND FOR TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE BEST POSSIBLE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN THE FACE OF ON GOING SHIFT WORK AND JETLAG CAN FIND THAT EPISODE ON OUR WEPSIDE YOU BRUM LABDOK COM LOTS OF BEHAVIAL TOOLS SOME OTHER TOOLS AS WELL NONE THE LESS HUMAN BEINGS ARE DIURNAL WE WERE REALLY DESIGN TO BE AWAKE MOSTLY IN THE DAY AND A SLEEP AT NIGHT RARE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS WHERE PEOPLE LIKE TO STAY UP LATE AN SLEEP IN LATE BUT WE ARE A DIURNAL SPECIES BY WAY OF OUR CENETIC WIRING AND OUR NERAL CIRCUIT WIRING THERE'S A PARTICULAR FEATURE TO OUR DIURNAL DIURNAL MEANING THE OPPOSITE OF NOCTURNAL OUR DIRNAL PATTERN OF THE RELEASE OF A HORMONE CALLED CORTIAL CORTISAL IS A STRESS FORMONE ITS SOMETIMES CALLED BUT CORTISAL HAS A LOT OF OTHER EFFECTS MANY OF WHICH ARE POSIVE CORTISALL FOR INSTANCE PROTECTS US AGAINST INFECTION IT CAN HELP US IN TERMS OF WAKING UP IN THE MORNING IN FACT THE PULSE AS ITS CALLED OR THE SPIKE IN CORTISALL EARLY IN THE DAY IS PART OF THE REASON WE WAKE UP ITS LINK TO OUR INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE RHYTHMS AND CAN FURTHER INCREASE OUR TEMPERATURE WHICH LEADS TO WAKING AND SO ON THE TYPICAL PATTERN OF CORTISALL IN A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL AND WE REALLY CAN SAY PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL IS THAT CORTISALL AS CAN TO BE SOMEWHAT HIGH RIGHT AROUND WAKING AND THEN IS GOING TO BE HIGHEST AS IT EVER WILL BE IN THE TWENTY FOR HOUR PERIOD ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES POSTWAKING NOT EXACTLY FORTY FIVE MINUTES BUT ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN IT WILL DROP GRADUALLY SUCH THAT BY ABOUT FOUR P M IN THE AFTERNOON WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHEN BODY TEMPERATURE TENDS TO START TO DROP AS WELLED CORTISALL TENDS TO BE VERY LOW AND THEN REMAINS LOW IN A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL SUCH THAT NINE P M ITS VERY LOW AND THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AS WE SLEEP ITS VERY LOW IN FACT SPIKES OR PULSES IN NINE P M CORTISL ARE A FAIRLY RELIABLE BIOL MARK OR READ OUT OF CERTAIN FORMS OF DEPRESSION AND CRONIC ANXIETY THIS RELATES TO THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF MY COLLEGUES AT STAMFORD AND STAMPORED CHOOL OF MEDICIN DOCTOR DAVID SPEAGAL WHO'S BEEN ON THIS PODCAST AND DOCTOR ROBERTS UPULSKY WHO HAS ALSO BEEN ON THIS PODCAST THEREIS A VERY INTERESTING PAPER EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORTISAL RHYTHMS AND GRIEVING IN PARTICULAR COMPLICATED VERSES NON COMPLICATED GRIEVING AGAIN COMPLICATED GRIEVING BEING THE FORM OF GRIEVING THAT REFLECTS A IMMENSE CHALLENGE OF PEOPLE MOVING THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS SUCH THAT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH RIGHT AGAIN GRIEVING IS HEALTHY BUT COMPLICATED GRIEVING IS A PROLONGED GRIEVING AND HAS OTHER DIMENSIONS AS WELL HENCE THE NAME COMPLICATED THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS DIURNAL CORTISALL IN COMPLICATED AND NON COMPLICATED GRIEF SLOPE DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE DAY AND THE FIGURE TO ORIEN TO IN THIS PAPER IF YOU DO DECIDE TO CHECK IT OUT AN AND WILL PUT A LINK TO IT IS FIGURE ONE WHICH BEAUTIFULLY SHOWS SHOULDS A VERY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT IN INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING COMPLICATED GRIEF THEREIS THE SAME GENERAL CONTOUR OF HIGH CORTISALL UPON WAKING EVEN HIGHER ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES AFTER WAKING AND THEN A REDUCTION IN CORTISALL BY FOUR P M AND EVEN FURTHER REDUCTION BY NINE P M SO JUST AS IT WERE IN AND TYPICAL INDIVIDUAL OR SOMEBODY WHO IS IN NON COMPLICATED GRIEVING HOWEVER WHEN YOU COMPARE THE CORTSAL LEVELS BETWEEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCING COMPLICATED GRIEVING VERSE IS NON COMPLICATED GRIEVING WHEL YOU FIND IS THE FOUR P M AND NINE P M CORTISAL LEVELS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THEN THEY ARE IN THE NON COMPLICATED GRIEVING GROUP THIS RAISE IS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA AND RELATES VERY CLOSELY TO WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WITH VAGAL TONE YOU COULD IMAGINE A SITUATION IN WHICH PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING COMPLICATED GRIEF HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF AFTERNOON AND NIGHT TIME CORTOISALL BECAUSE THEY ARE IN COMPLICATED GRIEF BUT YOU COULD ALSO IMAGINE THE OPPOSITE THAT THEIRE EXPERIENCING COMPLICATED GRIEF BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE ELEVATED CORTOISAL NOW IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT IT'S BY DIRECTIONAL THAT THE ANSWER IS 'T ONE OR THE OTHER BUT BOTH THAT COMPLICATED GRIEF CHANGES PATTERNS OF CORTISL AND THAT PATTERNS OF CORTISAL CHANGE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ONE HAS COMPLICATED GRIEF THAT THE MOST LOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF DATA LIKE THESE HOWEVER WHEN TAKEN ALONG WITH THE DATA ON VAGAL TONE THAT PEOPLE W HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF VAGAL TONE ARE BET BETTER ABLE TO NAVIGATE SITUATIONS THAT OF THE SORT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THAT SOME PEOPLE PERHAPS HAVE OXYTOSIN RECEPTERS OR PATTERNS OF CATACOLAMENES OR EPINEPERON THAT POSITION THEM TO BE MORE LIKELY TO GRIEVE IN A PARTICULAR WAY WE ARRIVE AT A SYNARIO WHERE IT MAKES VERY GOOD SENSE TO THINK ABOUT MOTULATING THAT IS CONTROLLING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR LIGFE IN A WAY THAT ESTABLISHES CORTISAL RHYTHMS AND SLEEP PATTERNS AND PATTERNS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND CATACOLEMINE RELIEF THAT POSITION YOU TO NAVIGATE THE GRIEF PROCESS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY IF THAT WAS THE COMPLICATED MOUTHFUL TO DIGEST LET ME RESTATET IN A SIMPLER WAY IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS HEADING INTO GRIEF OR IS CHALLENGE WITH GRIEF COMPLICATED GRIEF OR OTHERWISE PROLONG GRIEF OR OTHERWISE GETTING ADEQUATE SLEEP AT NIGHT AND ESTABLISHING AS NORMAL A PATTERN OF CORTOIALL AS POSSIBLE IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND THERE'S A VERY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TE DO THIS AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE LISTENERS OF THIS PODCASTS IN ADVANCE IF I SOUNLIKE A REPEATING RECORD BUT THE MOST POWERFUL WAY TO DO THIS IS TO VIEW SUNLIGHT VERY CLOSE TO WAKENG IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE RIGHT AT SUNRISE BUT WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING IF THE SUN ISN'T OUBT PLEASE TURN ON AS MANY BRIGHT LIGHTS AS POSSIBLE IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND THEN ONCE THE SUN IS OUT TRY AND GET SOME BRIGHT SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYE NEVER LOOK AT ANY LIGHT SO BRIGHT THAT IT'S PAINFUL TO LOOK AT SUNLIGHT OR OTHERWISE IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA OF THE WORLD WHERE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF SUNLIGHT PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT SUNLIGHT COMING THROUGH CLOUD COVER IS GOING TO STILL BE A VERY EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR ESTABLISHING THIS CORTIS ALL RYTHM WHY DO I SAY THIS THING ABOUT SUNLIGHT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WILL HAVING AN EARLY DAY CORTISAL PIQUE AND A VERY LOW CORTOISALL LEVEL LATE IN THE DAY FOUR P M AND NINE P M IS IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL IT'S REFLECTS A PROPERLY REGULATED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IT MEANS BEING ALERT DURING THE DAY AND YOUR ABILITY TO SLEEP AT NIGHT IS QUITE TIGHTLY CORELATED TO THIS VIEWING OF SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNING IF YOUR HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS OR THESE PROTOCALLS PLEASE SEE OUR MASTERING SLEEP EPISODE ALSO AT HU REMAN LABDOT COM BUT IN BRIEF YOU DON'T WANT A WERE SUNGLASSES WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS THROUGH A WINDOW OR WIN SHIELD IT IS FIFTY TIMES LESS EFFECTIVE AT LEAST BECAUSE OF FILTERING OF THE PROPER WAVELINGS IT IS FINE TO WHERE EYE GLASSES MEANING CORRECTIVE LENDSES OR CONTACTS EVEN IF THEY HAVE U VE PROTECTION AGAIN SUNLIGHT IS BEST TEN MINUTES TO THIRTY MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW BRIGHT IT IS OUTSIDE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS PROTOCOL BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IT IS A ZERO COST BUT VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO REGULATE THINGS LIKE CORTIZAL RHYTHMS MELETONE AND RHYTHMS WAKEFULNESS DURING THE DAY EAS AFALLING ASLEEP AT NIGHT AND SO ON AND SECOND OF ALL BECAUSE I WANT EMPHASIZE THIS IDEA OF MODULATION THERE ARE PROCESSES IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY WHICH DIRECTLY MEDIATE SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OR PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT RIGHT DOBLEMEAN IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO STRUGGLES WITH MOTIVATION YOUR DOBLEMEAN SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO BE DISREGULATED IN SOME WAY AND THERE ARE BEHAVIAL TOOLS AND OTHER TOOLS TO ADJUST THAT WE HAD AN EPISODE ON DOPE REVINE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE THAT TALKS EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THOSE TOOLS HOWEVER THE PROCESS OF GRIEF CAN'T BE DISTILL DOWN TO ONE MOLECULE ONE CIRCUIT SUCH THAT WE CAN SAY OH YOU KNOW TAKE THIS SUPPLEMENT OR EAT THIS DIETAND OR EXERCISE IN THE FOLLOWING WAY AND YOU WILL RECOVER FROM GRIEF MORE QUICKLY IT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE IT IS THE CASE HOWEVER THAT PROPER SLEEP AT NIGHT SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPER EMOTIONAL TONE TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE PHYSICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OTHER TYPES OF CHALLENGES AND NOT INCIDENTALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT I SHOULD SAY SUFFICIENT DIRATION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP AT NIGHT IS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU ENGAGE NEURAL PLASTICITY THE REORDERING OF NURL CONNECTIONS ND EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO DAY ABOUT REORDERING OF THE MAPS IN YOUR MIND THIS TRIPARTACT THREE PART MAP OF SPACE TIME AND CLOSENESS INVOLVES NEURAL PLASTICITY THE RECONFIGURING OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURONS STRENGTHENING CERTAIN PATHWAYS AND NOT S DRENGTHENING OTHERS ACTIVELY TRYING TO DISENGAGE FROM THE WHAT IF RIGHT THIS COUNTER INTO IT OF THINKING ACTIVELY TRYING TO DISENGAGE FROM THE EXPECTATIONS THAT SOME ONE WILL BE THERE ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF DOING THAT UNDERSTANDING WYAIT SO REFLECTSIVE AND NORMAL TO DO THAT ACTIVELY TRYING TO LEAN INTO THE REAL ATTACHMENT TO SOMEBODY ANIMAL OR THING AND YET AT THE SAME TIME NOT DELUDING YOURSELF AND UNDERMINING THE WHOLE PROCESS OF GRIEVING BY TRYING TO IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE IN FACTS STILL TRULY THERE IT IT'S A VERY NARROW NIFE EDGE OF A PROCESS WHICH IS WYIT SO CHALLENGING REGULATING YOUR CORTISAL RHYTHM THROUGH VIEWING SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND I SHOULD ALSO SAY AVOIDING BRIGHT LIGHTS FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES IN THE EVENING GENERALLY TEN P M DEFOR I M BUT CERTAINLY IN THE EVENING TRYING TO DIM LIGHTS IN YOUR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT TRYING TO AVOID BRIGHT SCREENS BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND ACCESSING THAT DEEP SLEEP THAT'S MODUL LATING AT SETTING AN OVERALL AUTONOMIC STATE OR AN OVERALL AUTONOMIC LANDSCAPE WOULD BE THE BETTER WAY TO DESCRIBE IT THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO SLEEP AND GET NERL PLASTICITY SLEEP AND BE IN THE BEST EMOTIONAL STATE TO NAVIGATE THE GRIEVING PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FAIR TO SAY THAT THE GRIEVING PROCESSESS WERE DESCRIBING IT IS HORD AND NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S EMOTIONALLY HARD IT'S COGNATIVELY HARD YOU JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT'S REQUIRE TO MOVE THROUGH GRIEF PROPERLY IF YOU WILL IT'S THINKING ABOUT AND ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY EXPERIENCING THE DEPTH THE FULL DEPTH OF THE ATTACHMENT TO THE PERSON WHILE AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO UNCOUPLE FROM THAT RICH MEN YOU THAT CATALOGUE OF EPISOTIC MEMORIES THAT CAN DATE BACK MANY MANY YEARS AND HAVE SO MUCH RICHNESS SO MANY PREDICTIONS FORM ON THE BASIS OF THOSE EPISOTIC MEMORIES AND ACTIVELY TRYING TO DISTANCE OURSELVES FROM THOSE MEMORIES BY BEING VERY ANCHORED IN THE FACT THAT WE ARE A PRESENT WE ARE THE PERSON ALONE IN THAT ROOM OR IN SOME CASES WITH A BEREVEMENT GROUP IN THAT ROOM OR WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE MORNING THE LOSS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL OR THING AND THAT NIFE EDGE OF FEELING THE INTENSE ATTACHMENT WHILE ALSO DISENGAGING FROM ALL THE THINGS THAT LED TO THAT ATTACHMENT WELL IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THAT WOULD BE SO CHALLENGING AND IT SHOULD ALSO BE UNDER UNDERSTANDABLE WHY POSITIONING YOURSELF TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY REQUIRES PROPER SLEEP SO WHAT ARE THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT USING IN TERMS OF HEALTHY ADAPTIVE MOVING THROUGH GRIEF TRYING TO AVOID COMPLICATED GRIEF AND PROLONGED GRIEF DISORDERS REALISE THAT WE'RE DISORDER IMPLIES ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT AGAIN THOSE ARE JUSTNAMING CATERGRIZATIONS ON THAT PEOPLE COME UP WITH THAT I THINK FAIRLY REFLECT THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE MORE CHALLENGE MOVING THROUGH GRIEVING THAN OTHERS AND FOR SOME PEOPLE CAN BE VERY EXTENDED I THINK THE COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING IS THAT PROPER GRIEVING INVOLVES MOVING THROUGH SOMETHING QUICKLY OR CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THAT HOWEVER IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT SOME PEOPLE CAN GET STUCK AND THAT PROCESS OF GETTING STUCK YOU SHOULD NOW UNDERSTAND HAS A LOT TO DO WITH MAINTAINING OR REACTIVATING THOSE EPISOTIC MEMORIES THOSE EXPECTATIONS OF WEARE SOMEWY SOMEBODY WILL BE IN SPACE AND TIME S WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT THE TOOLS FOR MOVING THROUGH GRIEF CLEARLY IT'S OF VALUE TO DEDICATE SOME PERIOD OF TIME PERHAPS EVERY DAY PERHAPS EVERY OTHER DAY DEPENDING ON YOUR CAPACITY AND SCHEDUAL THESE COULD BE PERIODS OF TIME RANGING ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES MAY BE LONGER THESE BLOCKS OF TIME WOULD BE APPROPRIATELY DESCRIBED AS RATIONAL GRIEVING RATIONAL GRIEVING IS A CLEAR ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW REALITY THAT THE PERSON ANIMAL OR THING NO LONGER EXISTS IN THE SAME SPACETIME TIMENSIONALITY THAT WE KNEW THAN BEFORE AND YET HOLDING ON TO AN ANCHORING TO THE ATTACHMENT THAT WE HAD THIS IS AGAIN NOT AN UNHEALTHY AND ERING TO THE ATTACHMENT THIS IS REALLY ANCHORING TO THE DEPTH AND THE ANTENSITY OF THE ATTACHMENT THAT EXISTED AS A WAY TO FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY TO PUT IT PUSH OFF FROM THOSE EPISOTIC MEMORIES TO DISTANCE OURSELVES FROM THEM BECAUSE THOSE EPISOTIC MEMORIES ARE THER ONES THAT LEAD US TO LOOK FOR THE PERSON IN OUR CURRENT REALITY AND ASSUMING THIS IS A REAL IN COMPLETE LOSS THOSE SORTS OF EXPECTATIONS ARE MALEDAPT IF THEY DO NOT SERVE US WELL THE SECOND ASPECT OF THIS IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE KNOWED OF THE MAP THE COMPONENT OF THE NARRW MAP THAT YOURE ANCHORING TO IS A VERY REAL COMPONENT OF YOU THESE ARE LITERALLY CELLS THAT REPRESENT THE DEPTH OF ATTACHMENT THEY ARE LINKED UP WITH YOUR EMOTIONAL CENTERS IN THE BRAIN AND INDEED THEARE LINKED UP WITH YOUR BODY I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES UP SO OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE GRIEVING AS WHY DOES IT HURT SO MUCH WILL THAT HURT IS THAT YEARNING IT'S THAT ANTICIPATION OF ACTION THAT YOU WANT TO ENGAGE IN BUT SOME PART OF YOU AT LEAST KNOWS THAT IT LEADS NOWHERE IT'S THAT REACHING FOR THAT GLASS OF WATER IN A AND A DESERT OF THIRST AND YOU NOW YOU CAN'T HAVE IT THAT'S WHY IT HURT SO BADLY BECAUSE THE SYSTEMS OF YOUR BRAIN IMBODY ARE IN A PLACE OF ANTICIPATION OF READINESS AND GIVEN THE ACTIVATION OF THESE BRAIN REWARD SYSTEMS LIKE THE NUCLEO SECUMBANS GIVEN YOUR NOW UNDERSTANDING OF OXYTOSIN BEING MORE ENRICHED IND THE OXY TO INSCUSE ME IN THE NUCLYSECUMBONS OF SOME INDIVIDUALS AND AS SUPPOSE TO OTHERS IT SHOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE AS TO WHY IT SO PAINFUL IN YOUR BODY WE TALKED A MOMENT AGO ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ACISING QUALITY SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS GAVE YOU AT LEAST ONE TOOL TO DO THAT THERE AGAIN A RICH ARRAY OF TOOLS TO DO THAT IN THE MASTERING SLEEP EPISODE AND AGAIN HIGH LIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP FOR NOT JUST EMOTION REGULATION AND AUTONOMIC CONTROL WHICH IS SO VITAL BUT ALSO FOR MAKING SURE THAT NEURO PLASTICITY TAKES PLACE BECAUSE AGAIN NEURA PLASTICIES A TWO PART PROCESS THERE'S THE TRIGGERING OF THE PLASTICITY WHICH IN THE CASE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY WILL BE NATURALLY ACTIVATED BY THE PRACTICE OF A DEDICATED FOCUSING ON THE ATTACHMENT FEELING THE ATTACHMENT TO THE PERSON MAYBEVEN RITING ABOUT THE ATTACHMENT TO THE PERSON AS WAS DESCRIBED IN THAT PREVIOUS STUDY BUT ALSO JUST THE PLASTICITY IS TRIGGER BY THE MERE LOSS OF THAT PERSON THE INTENSITY OF THAT EXPERIENCE BUT NEUROL PLASTOSY THE LITERAL REWIRING OF CONNECTIONS OCCURS DURING DEEP SLEEP AND IN WHAT I CALL NONSLEEP DEEP REST OR ANASTYAR AND YOU CAN FIND ANISTY AR SCRIPS THIESE ARE SHORT BEHAVIORAL PROTOCOLS THAT YOU DO FOR TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES AT SOME POINT THROUGHOUT THE DAY MAYBE VEN MULTIPLE TIMES TO DAY THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ACCELERATE NEURAL PLASTICITY SO HAVING A  SUCH A PRACTISE CAN BE VERY USEFUL AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT INVOLVES SOME COGNATIVE WORK WE HAVE TO HOLD ON TO THE ATTACHMENT AND IMAGINE AND FEEL AS MUCH AS WE CAN THE ATTACHMENT WHILE ALSO BEING EXTREMELY RATIONALLY GROUNDED AND TRYING TO NOT TRY TO HOLD ON TO THE PAST TRYING TO N OT ANTICIPATE THE PERSON WALKING IN THE ROOM THIS IS VERY HARD BECAUSE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE ATTACHMENT THE ATTACHMENT TENDS TO DRAG WITH IT THOSE EPOSOTIC MEMORIES THAT RICH CATALOGUE OF EXPERIENCES THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL WALK IN THE ROOM IS PERFECTLY NATURAL THE HARD COGNIVE WORK IS TOO EXPERIENCE THE DEEP EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SEVERING FROM OR DISTANCING OURSELVES FROM THESE EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY'LL SUDDENLY SHOW UP IN OUR REALITY WHEN IN FACT THEY WON'T END WE TALKED ABOUT PREPARING OURSELVES FOR GRIEF IHT IF WE HAVE A LOVED ONE THAT'S DYING OR WE ANTICIPATE THAT AT SOME POINT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOSS OF SOME SORT COULD BE DEATH COULD BE A LOSS OF ANOTHER TYPE BREAK UP ET CETERA THAT WE CAN PREPARE OURSELVES TO GRIEF MORE ADAPTIVLY BY REGULATING THE LEVEL OF CATACOLAMENES IN PARTICULAR EPINEPERAN THAT WAS WELL DESCRIBED IN THE STUDY THAT AREREFER TO EARLIER AND TOOLS SUCH AS THE ONE FOUND IN OUR MASTERING STRESS EPISODE END TOOLS OF THE SORT THA WE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY INCREASING THAT VAGAL TONE BY ACTIVELY BUILDING UP THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXALES AND SLOWING DOWN OF THE HART RATE SO CALLED RESPITORY SCIGNESS THEY RHYTHMIA THOSE THING TO BE VERY USEFUL TOOLS SO WE CAN ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BUILD OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BUILD OUR MIND TO PREPARE FOR GRIEF WHEN IT INEVITABLY WILL COME AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT BUFFERING OURSELVES FROM THE REALITIES OF LIFE THIS IS NOT ABOUT DISENGAGING FROM GRIEF AS A REAL AND IMPORTANT PROCESS AND INDEED IT IS A REAL END IMPORTANT PROCESS TO ENGAGE IN THOSE THAT ENTER DENIAL OR TRYING DISTRACT THEMSELVES WITH SUBSTANCEIS OR THINKING OR DISTRACTING OF BEHAVIOR SUBSTANCES OR OTHERWISE WON'T MOVE THROUGH GRIEF AS WELL AS ADAPTIDLY AS THOSE WHO EMBRACE A PROCESS OF THE SORT THAT I'M DESCRIBING HERE AND OF COURSE I WANT A RESTATE AGAIN THAT EVEN THOUGH GRIEF AND DEPRESSION ARE NOW KNOWN TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE MOVE THROUGH THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF GRIEF AT DIFFERENT RATES AND SOMETIMES SKIP STAGES ET CETERA IT IS OFTEN IMPORTANT TO ACCESS OF TRAINED PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGISTS OR PSYCHATRIS OR BOTH WERE BEREAVEMENT GROUF R ALL OF THE ABOVE IN ORDER TO GET THE PROPER SUPPORT FOR GRIEVING SO THIS IS A PODCAST ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE BASE TOOLS BUT I ABSOLUTELY WANT T EMPHASIZE THAT THEIRE TERRIFIC RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN ACTS US I DON'T SAY THIS IN ANY KIND OF GLIB OR KIND OF IN O PASS THE BUT KIND OWAY THERERE WONDERFUL TRAINED THERAPISTS BEREAVEMENT GROUPS PSYCHATRIS THAT ARE EXPERT IN NAVIGATING THE SORTS OF THINGS I LIKE TO THINK THAT THE TOOLS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY WOULD BE NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE BUT WOULD BE COMPLIMENTARY TO THE SORTS OF APPROACHES THAT THEY TAKE AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS PROCESS OF GRIEF AS WE ALL SHOULD AT SOME POINT IN OUR LIVES BECAUSE WE ALL INDEED WILL EXPERIENCE GRIEF AND ONE FORMER ANOTHER I WOULD HOPE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE DISDISCUSS TODAY WOULD NOT ONLY GIVE YOU SOME TOOLS BUT HOPEFULLY GIVE YOU A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF NOT JUST THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE LOST OR THAT YOU STAND TO LOSE NOT JUST THE ANIMALS THAT YOU'VE LOST AND STAND TO LOSE BUT ALSO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHY IT IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL IN YOUR LIFE AND THA YOURE ATTACHED TO THE ANIMALS THAT ARE STILL IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOURE TTACHED TO HAVE SUCH PROFOUND MEANING FOR YOU AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT LEAN AWAY FROM BUT RATHER TO LEAN INTO THE BUILDING OF THOSE EPISOTIC MEMORIES TO BUILD UP A RICHER AND RICHER SET OF EXPERIENCES AND EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS BECAUSE WHILE THE PROCESS OF GRIEVING IS IN  DIRECT RELATION TO HOW CLOSE WE ARE ATTACHED TO PEOPLE THERE ARE WAYS TO MOVE THROUGH IT AND OF COURSE IT IS THE DEPTH OF OUR ATTACHMENTS AND THE NUMBER AND THE DEPTH OF MEANING OF EXPERIENCES THAT WE SHARE WITH OTHERS AND WITH ANIMALS THAT MAKES LIFE SO RICH AND WORTH LIVING I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND SAY THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO EXPLORE THIS RATHER COMPLICATED AND SOMETIMES EXTREMELY CHALLENGING THING THAT WE CALL GRIEF FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OR THROUGH THE LENDS OF NERO SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY I CERTAINLY LEARNED A LOT IN EXPLORING THIS LITERATURE ELSE A REALLY LOOK FOR TO HOSTING PEOPLE LIKE DOCTOR O CONER ON THE PODCAST AND OTHERS ON THE PODCAST WHO'VE DONE SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORK IN THIS AREA IV PUT OUT THE REQUEST AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL JOIN US SOON TO FURTHER ELABORATE AND TEACH US ABOUT THIS FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF OUR LIVES IF YOU ARE LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBED TO U ON YOU TO THAT'S A TERRIFIC  ZERO COSTWAY TO SUPPORT US IN ADDITION PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO

SUPPORT US NOT DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE BUT ON MANY PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THE HUBREUMEN LADPODCAST WEVE DISCUSSED SUPPLEMENTS WHILE SUPPLEMENTS AREN'T NECESSARY FOR EVERYBODY MANY PEOPLE DERIVED TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FROM THEM FOR THINGS LIKE EASING AND ECCELERATING THE TRANSITION TIME INTO SLEEP AND GETTING BETTER DEEPER SLEEP AS WELL AS THINGS SUCH AS FOCUS ET CETERA WE'VE PARTNERED WITH MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS FIRST OF ALL ARE OF EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT ALSO THEY SHIP INTERNATIONALLY WE HADE HEARD FROM MANY OF YOU THAT YOUR HAVING TROUBLE ACCESS ING SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT WERE DESCRIBED ON TH HUBERMAN LABPODCAST BECAUSE YOU DID NOT LIVE IN THE USMOMENTOUS SHIPS BOTH WITHIN TE US AND ABROAD END MANY OF YOU HAVE ALSO REQUESTED THAT THERE BE A SINGLE SIGHT WHERE YOU COULD ACCEST ALL OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE HUBREUMEN LABPODCAST RIGHT NOW AT LIVEMOMENTOUS DOCKCOM SLASH HUBERMEN YOU CAN FIND A SUBSET OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT BEEN DESCRIBED ON THIS P ODCAST AGAIN ALL OF THE VERY HIGHEST QUALITY EACH SINGLE INGREDIENT SUPPLEMENTS THAT TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP THE PROPER ARRAY OF SUPPLEMENTS FOR YOU IT'S NOT HELPFUL TO HAVE SUPPLEMENTS THAT INCLUDE MANY INGREDIENTS SO WE ENCOURAGE MOMENTOUS TO HAVE SINGLE INGREDIENT SUPPLEMENTS WITH DOSAGES THAT ALLOW YOU TO BUILD UP FROM THE MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSE AND SO ON AND THE CATTALOGUE OF SUPPLEMENTS THEY ARE GOING TO ADD TO THAT LOCATION LIBOMENTO STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMAN IS GOING TO EXPAND IN THE

AMERICAN LIFE AT WORK HITHEVERYBODY I REGLASS HERE IT'S SMARK LIFE RM TO BE BEASY CHICAGO JUST HERE FOR A MINUTE TO SAY WE HAVE A SPECIAL SHOW FOR YOU TO DAY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS ON A JOFFEY WALL AS BEEN REPORTING A LOT ON EDUCATION AT SCHOOLS AND THREE YEARS AGO SHE DID THIS STOY THIS ABOUT A PART OF EDUCATION THEVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT BUT I THINK WE DO NOT TALK ABOUT MUCH AT ALL NOT AWAY THE FEELS LIKE ANYTHING AND THIS ONE OF MY FAVORATURES WE'VE EVER DONE AND FULL OF SURPRISE TURNS TO TWISTS ON I DON'T WONE WASTE ANY MORE TIME HERE SETTING THIS OPSON JUST GON A HAND OVER THE CHOTOJONA SO WE CAN GET TO IT HERE SHE IS LESSA AND ANGELA ARE BOTH TEACHERS BOTH IN THE BRANCS AND NEW YOR CITY BOTH RELENTLESSLY ENERGETIC WOMEN WHO MAKE GENEROUS USE OF THEIR ARMS WHILE TALKING THEY MET YEARS AGO THEY LIKED EACH OTHER IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE LISA AND ANGELA WERE PART OF A PROGRAMME THAT BROUGHT THEIR TWO SCHOOLS TOGETHER  SORT OF A CLASS ROOM EXCHANGE KID'S FROM LISAS SCHOOL WOULD SEE ANGELA SCHOOL AND VICE VIRSA THEY THUGT THEIR STUDENTS WOELD GET A LOT OUT OF MEETING EACH OTHER AND LEARNING ABOUT ONE ANOTHER SCHOOLS TBE CAUSE THEIR STUDENTS SPEND THEIR SCHOOL DAYS IN TWO VERY DIFFERENT PLACES TESE A GREEN BOUND SCHOOL UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS HIGH SCHOOL IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL IT'S NINETY SEVEN PER CENT BLACK IN HIS BANNIC IT'S LOCATED IN THE POOREST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY THE SOUTH BRANCS ANGELA VASSAS AF SCHOOL FIELDSTON IS ALSO IN THE BRANC BUT IT'S ONE OF NEW YORK CITIES IN LE PRIVATE SCHOOLS IT'S SEVENTY PER CENMT WHITE IT'S KNOWN AS A PROGRESSIVE SCHOOL ONE IN FIVE KIDS GETS FINANCHLAD WHICH I'S HELPFUL BECAUSE LAST YEAR TUITION WAS FORTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS THESE TWO SCHOOLS WORTH THREE MILES FROM EACH OTHER UT THE STUDENTS BASICALLY NEEDED A FAREIGN EXCHANGE PROGRAM TO MEET EACH OTHEC  THE TUCHER STARTED BY HAVING THEIR STUDENTS RAIGHT LETTERS TO EACH OTHER THEY WERE PEN PAUSE FOR A WHILE WHICH WAS GOING WELL AND THEND LSA AND ANGELA PLAND A TIME TO GET THEM TOGETHER LISA THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER SAYS THE MOMENT HER KIDS GOT OFF THE BUSSAT FIELDSTON THE PRIVATE SCHOOL THEY HAD A DRAMATIC REACTION TO WHAT THEYSAW THEY COULD'T BLEAVE THA CAMPIS THEY FELT LIKE EVERYONE WAS LOOKING AT THEM AND ONE OF THE STUDENTS STARTE SCREAMING CRYING LIKE THIS IS ON FAIR A THISS TISS I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE I'M LEAV IM LEADING RIGHT NOW AN GOING HOME WE'RE LIKE MELONY IT'S O KA YOU SHOULD STAY WITH THE GRUP LET'S TALK I KOW   SOME CONTECTS UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THESE KIDS WERE COMING FROM IT'S SMALL AND FRIENDLY THEY ARE NO MEAL DETECTERS BUT IT'S A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD THE KIDS SHARE OF BUILDING AND A GIM WITH ANOTHER SCHOOL THE PRIVATE SCHOOL FIELDSTON HAS AN EIGHTEEN ACRE KAMPAS ON A HILL STONE BUILDINGS ARE CONNECTED BY LANDSCAPED PATHS EVERY FEW WINDOWS IS THE SIZE OF A GORAGE DOOR THERE'S A DANC STUDIO IN ART GALLERY A POOL SO ON THAT FIRST DAY THE PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS ALMOST ALL OF THEM PORTERY KIN AND DEMANKING KIDS FROM THE SOUTH BRANCE WALK ON TO THE CAMPAS LOOK AROUND AT THE QUAD THE TREES SEE THE SCHOOLS MISSION ETCHED INTO THE STONE ARCHES ANGELA THE PRIVATE SCHOOL TEACHER FROM FIELDSTON CAME TO GREET THEM AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE GIRLS SEEMED UPSET AND I WENT OVER TO TALKDOR AS IDLISA AND THAT SHE JUMPED UP AND SHE SAID WE'V GOT A GET OT HERE WE GET TO GET AT HERE W GET O GET AT HERE AND I THOGHT IT WAS A CHOKE AT THE BEGINNING I DIDN'T REALIZED YOU KNOW AND IT REALLY WAS I MEAN SHE WENT WHITE LIKE COMPLETELY WHITE YOUT'LL BLOODJOY FROM HER FACE AND HER FRIEND WAS HOLDING ERS E COLLNAL MILINY CALLED ELLMILITY SO IT WAS JUST UNAWFUL SITUATION NONE OF US HAND HAD ANTICIPATED SUCH A WRONG REACTION  R THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PROGRAMMS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE TRYING TO DO SOME VERSION OF THIS EXCHANGE PROGRAM THE HELP PEOPLE CONNECT ACROSS A GROWING DIVIDE FOR A LOT OF STUDENTS AMERICAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE MORE SEGREGATED THAN THEY WERE A GENERATION AGO NOT LESS THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR IS WIDER THAN IS BEN SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSIONS THESICALLY WHATEVER GAP YOU HEREABOUT INCOME GAP ACHIEVEMENT GAP WE SHALL DIVIDE THESE TWO GROUPS OF KIDS FROM UNIVERSITY HIGHTS AND FIELDSTON EXIST ON OPPOSITE SDES AND JUST SEEING ACROSS THAT DIVIDE SOMETHING SO MANY OF US NEVER DO CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL IN THIS CASE FROM THE VERY FIRST FEW MINUTES IT WAS DEFINITELY DRAMATIC THIS INCIDENT WHEN THE KIDS VISITED FIELDSTON HAPPENED TEN YEARS AGO AND I HEARD THIS STORY FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE THE TEACHERS KID'S FROM BOTH SCHOOLS ALISON ROLAND WAS A JUNIOR AT THE PRIVATE SCHOOL FIELDSTON AT THE TIME SHE REMEMBERS THE GIRL WHO FREEKED OUT PEOPLEWERE LIKE WHAT HAPPEN THAT WAS LIKE UEIRD BUT NOBODY REALLY IT WAS VERY BEHIND THE SCENES EVEN MORE SHE REMEMBERS THE FEELING SHE HAD SEEING THE GIRL FREEK OUT FEELING HELPLESS IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE YOU CAN'T HELP SOE ONE NOT BE UNCOMFORTABLE AH YOU NO ONE WANTS TO FE LIKE THOR ON THE HILL SCHOOL ON THE TOP OF THE HILL ON THER PEOP  LIKE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME LIKE I TOLD YOHAT ER SHI WHERE SHE WAS COMING FROMIN TERMS OF LIKE IT IS MEST OUT IT'S CRAZY LIKE OUR EDUCATIONS HAVE BEEN SO DROSTICALLY DEFREN AND THAT'S COMPLETELY ON FAR BUT LIKE WHAT YOU DO IN THE MOMENT WHEN YOUR SOOL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AN YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER YOU KNOW LIKE I'LL HAVE A DI COULDN'T BE CALL APOLITICSTION IN THAT MOMENT AND CHANGE I DON'T OUTAL MAKING CHANGE TO TAKE A LONG TIME A LOT OF FEELSONE TANTS DO GO ON TO NY COLITICIONS AN RUN WELL DISN'E IN THE NOR TIMES AND HOST EVENING NEWS PROGRAMMS AND DESIGN MAJOR AMERICAN CITIES IN PART OF THE POINT OF PROGRAMMS LIKE THESE THAT TRY A BRIDGE THE DIVIDE TIS SEEING AS THE PRIVATE SCHOL KIDS WIL LIKELY GO ON TO BE IMPORTANT IMFLUENTIAL PEOPLE MAY BE RIT EDUCATION POLICYE WOR FINANCE NEW BUSINESSES IT'S GOOD FOR THEM TO KNOW NOT EVERYBODY'S LIFE LOOKS LIKE KHEIRS BUT OF COURSE THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION WHAT DI THE PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS GET OUT OF IT WRAIT NOW THERE'S A POPULAR IDEA AN EDUCATION IT POPS UP ALL OVER THE PLACE ABOUT EXPOSURE THAT EXPOSURE IS PARTU CURELY IMPORTANT FOR POOR KIDS NOT JUST IMPORTANT THAT IT CAN CHANGE DESTINYES YOU KNOW YOU TAKE A GROUP OF KIDS TO TOR A COLLEGE CAMPUS THEY'LL BE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE OR IF YOU JUST KNOW SOME ONE WHO WENT TO COLLEGE THAT'LL HELP THE IDEA IS IF YOU WANT A KID TO MOVE FROM ONE SOCIAL CLASS TO ANOTHER THAT KID HAS TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE OVER THERE ON THE OTHER SIDE EXPOSURE IS A TOOL FOR SOCIAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY OR IT JUST SUX YOU SEE HOW MUCH YOU DID NOT GET AN ITS SHOCKING OR PAINFUL AND YOU FREEK OT LIKE THAT ONE GIRL MELANY THE PEOPLE WHO RUN PROGRAMS LIKE THESE HOPE THAT EVEN IF IT'S UP SETTING IN THE MOMENT ULTIMATELY THIS KIND OF EXPERIENCE HELPS MORE THAN IT HURTS BUT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS BECAUSE THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT PLAYS OUT OVER TIME IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE GROUP OF KIDS WHO WERE PART OF THAT FIRST YEAR EXCHANGE BETWEEN FIELDSTON AND UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS COULD ANSWER THIS QUESTION DOES IT HURT OR HELP THE PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS THEY'RE IN THEIR MID TWENTYES NOW SO THEY'VE GONE TO COLLEGE GOT AN APARTMENTS AND JABS IN IT TURNS OUT THIS ONE EXPERIENCE REALLY HAS SHAPED SOME OF THE PUBLICSCOL KISS IN PROFOUND WAYS LAS I DID NOT SE COMING TO DAYS SHOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SEE THE OTHER SIDE AND AT LIFS A LOT BETTER WAT'S BEKIN WITH MELONY THE GIRL WHO FREEKD DA I WONDERED ABOUT MELANYE BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH A STRONG IMMEDIATE REACTION THAT EVERYONE REMEMBERED BUT ALSO BECAUSE

THING I KEEP REEPLAYING IN MY HEAD AFTER TALKING ALL THESE PEOPLE IT'S THIS STORY ANGELA VASAS TOLD ME ABOUT MELANY GETTNG INTO MIDDLEBURY DYOU REMEMBER THAT THE TEACHER FROM FIELDS SIN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL REMEMBER HOW VIVID ANGELA'S MEMORY WAS AND SHE SAYS MELANY COME HERE MELANY GOES OP THEY LIKE FIFTY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM SHE SAYS A MIDDLEBURY ACCEPTED YOU FILL SCHOLARSHIP MELANY DID NOT GET INTO MIDDLEBURY SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER THIS MOMENT AT ALL BUT ANGELA DOES CLEARLY EVEN TO DAY SHE ACKNOWLEDGES IT MUST NOT HAVE BEEN WHAT REALLY HAPPEN BUT SHE REMEMBERS IT IFE A THEORY ABOUT THIS I THINK ANGELA HAS THIS MEMORY OF MELANY MAKING IT TRIUMPHANTLY MAKING IT BECAUSE IT IS REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT MELANY WOULD NOT MAKE  EIT AND I CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT I MET MELANY IN NOVEMBER AND I STILL CALL HER MOST WEEKS JUST TO SAY SO WHAT HAPPEN WITH YOUR DENTIST WITH YOUR GRADS WITH THAT MEETING WITH YOUR PROFESSOR I KEEP EXPECTING THERE TO BE NEWS LIKE SHE IS ABOUT TO GET HER BIG BREAKER SOMETHING AND THINGS WILL HAPPENED FOR HER I FEELS SUSPENSIFUL BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED FOR HER FOR TEN YEARS I THINK ITS SOME SPECIAL BRAND OF AMERICAN PATHELOGICAL OPTIMISM THAT SO MANY OF US BELIEVE THI STORY OF MELANY HAS TO TURN OUT TO BE HAPPY AND TET IF IT DOESN'T SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAS HAPPENED AND NOT JUST THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME THAT THE SUPER MARKET MIGHT BE FULL OF MELANIES MONACHUFY WALLD IS ONE OFTHEPRODUCENS OF OUR PROGRAMM S NOT BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE WER FIRST BROADCAST THIS STORY OR CALL JONATHAN AN MELANY ALL DESIDED THEY WONT TO BE EDUCATORS LIKE

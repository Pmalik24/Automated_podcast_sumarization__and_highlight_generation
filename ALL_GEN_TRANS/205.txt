OVERLY NICE DIXON AND THE COMMITTEE BROUGHT THESE ALLIGATIONS TO HIM AND GAVE VON ELINGER THE CHANCE TO RESIN QUIETLY AND TO AVOID ANY PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT BUT HE DIDN'T STEP DOWN INSTEAD HE TOLD THE COMMITTEE HE AND JANE DO HAD CONSENTUAL SECT TO THEM PURSUING A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP OF ANY KIND WITH AN INTURN WAS NOT OCAY IT SEEMD LIKE A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE RULE CONDUCT ON BECOMING SINCE HE REFUSED TO RESIGN THE ONLY OPTION THEY HAD LAUHT WAS TO CONVINCE TWO THIRDS OF THE HOUSE THAT VON ELINGER HAD VIOLATED CONDUCT ON BECOMING THEND THEY COULD GET A EXPELLED BUT TO DO THIS THEY'D HAVE TO

HAVING NO POWER SO ANY ATTEMPT TOWARD JUST ICE POLICE OR OR ACH OUR PROCEDURES SHOULD BE DESIGN TO MAKE SURE OF THE PERSON FEELS A SENSE OF CONTROL FOR INSTANCE BEFORE A VICTIM EVEN MAKES A REPORT THEY SHOULD KNOW WHAT ALL THE POSSIBLE STEPS OF THE PROSSESS COULD BE THAT WAY THEY CAN DESIDE IF THEY STILL WANT TO PROCEIDE ND IF IT'S A WORK PLACE LIKE THE STATE HOUSE YE WANT TO GIVE THE VICTIM THE OPTION TO GIVE THEIR TESTIMONY IN PRIVATE INSTEID OF FORESEENG THEM TO RETILE AND RELIVED THEIR ASSAULT IN PUBLIC IN THE IDA HO HOUSE THE PROCESS WASN'T DESIGNED WITH A SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM IN MIND INSTEAD IT LOOKED A LOT MORE LIKE A REGULAR CRIMINAL TRIAL DIXON TALKED A LOT ABOUT VON ELINGER'S RIGHT TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHELLE JANE SAYS SHE WASN'T CONSULTED ABOUT WHETHER SHE EVEN WANTED TO COME TO THE HEARING THEY ISSUED A SEPINA FOR HER TO APPEAR I ASKED DIXON WHY HE THOUGHT THAT WAS NECESSARY WE WERE SUPEMING OTHER WITNESSES INSODOMEN TO ACED SISTENCEO  THINK IS WHY ID JUST IT IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE WE WERE SAVORING ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER BECAUSE IT IS A SEPINA IF SHE HADN'T APPEARED THEN A RASQ IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT RIGHT YES I DON'T THINK IT I'S ABSOLUTE THAT ARREST IS THE CONSSEQUENCE OF THAT IF WE WANTED TA THAT AN WE COULD S SI SHE HADN'T CAM I MEAN I WHAT WOULD HAVE I DI DON'T KNOW I'S THAT'S TOS BECAUSE I FEEL SHE NEEDED TO BE THERE FOR THAT FACE YOUR ACUSE REPORTION OF IT IN THE DAYS LEAING UP TO THE HEARING JANE'S LAWYER SAID THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO PREVENT THE HEARING FROM BEING A DISASTER FOR HER THEY ASKED IF SHE COULD TESTIFI REMOTELY WITH HER VOICE DISGUISED OR EVEN BETTER IN A CLOSED SESTION THAT WASN'T OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THEY SAID THE ANSWER THEY ALWAYS GOT BACK FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS NOW NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER ON WHY THIS WAS ONE OF THE DEPUTY  GS RUNNING THE CASE DECLINED TO COMMENT DIXON TOLD ME HE NEVER RECEIVE TER ATTORNEY'S REQUEST INSAIS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OPEN TO JANE TESTIFYING REMOTELY IN THE END JANE'S LAWYER SAID THE ONLY PROTECTION THAT WAS OFFERED UP TO HER WERE THOSE BLACK CURTAINS SHE WOULD TELL HER STORY IN PUBLIC BEHIND A BLACK CURTAIN MAKING  TOI AP THE HEARING AND THE PROTECTIVE POWER OF TENNECHOS ITS IN A MINUTE  CICAGA PABAGRATIO WHEN OUR PROGRAMM CONTINUES SMEKE MI MY REGLASS TO DAY'S PROGRAMM JANE DO FIVE YEARS SINCE ME TOOBOOUP THERE ARE THESE SYSTEMS AT DISPOSE TO CRANK AN ACTION NOW HAN SOMEBODY STEPS FORWARD WE HADE THE STORY OF JANE DO ADA MADE DREW AN IG TO HO NOT TO BE CUEAR JANEDO DID NOT COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF ME TOO AF SHE WENT OF PRODUCER MAKING ME GASTER ABOUT IT JANES AD ALL SHE KNEW ABOUT ME TOO AS IT WAS SOMETHING FOR CELEBRITIES THEN THE LESS HE RESPONSE TO HER WAS SHAPE BY ME TO SHEWAS A TEST CASE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S NEW REPORTING SYSTEM THEY WERE MAKING UP AS THEY WENT WE PICK UP OUR STORY WITH AT TOO THE WITNESS IT'S UPT THIS PART OSTORY CONTAINS BRIEF REFERENCES TO SUICIDE HER S MEKY THE MORNING OF THE HEARING JANE WOKE UP TERRIFIED SHE HAD A FULL BLOWN PANIC ATTACK AND THREW UP SHE JUMPED IN THE SHOWER AND PUT ON BEAUTIFUL BY EMANEM TO TRY AND PUMP HERSELF UP SE THEN PUT ON A BLACK DROSS THIS WAS AN INSIDE JOKE TO HERSELF BECAUSE SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS ABOUT TO ATTENT HER OWN FUNERAL JANE'S MOM PICTURE UP AND THEY HADED TO THE CAPITAL HER LAWYERS TOLD ME THAT NOBODY CAME UP WITH A SECURE PLAN TO GET HER INTO THE BUILDING WITHOUT PEOPLE SEEING WHO SHE WAS SO ONE OF HER LAWYERS REACHED OUT TO A SENATOR WHO MET JANE IN HERMAM AT A PRIVATE ENTRANCE OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL THEN LED THEM THROUGH A SERIES OF TUNNELS AND SOME BACK HALLWAYS UNTIL JANE FINALLY GOT TO A DOOR IN THE HEARING ROOM SHE LOOKED AT THE CURTAINS AND A RANDOM BRONZE STATUE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S HEAD HER CHAIR WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM HIS EYES WOULDN'T MOVING NO  LIKE HESUS STARING AN E OL SIMEN SI O QE IT WAS JUST WERD JUST FLAT OUT WEARD WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU SAW THAT BLACK HURN WAS LIKE I CAN SEE THROUGH THIS I CAN SEE EVERYBODY LIKE THEY CAN SEE ME AND I WAS CENTIFOR HEO EFFIRS WIT THEY E DUDNSEEM FROM HER SIDE THE CURTAIN LOOKED MORE SHEAR SHE LOOKED THROUGH IT TO A ROOM PACKED WITH LEGISLATORS AN PRASS THE PEOPLE WHO COULD ACTUALLY SEE HER THOUGH INCLUDED VIVATTHIX COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEIR COUNSEL A SECRETARY TO DEPUTY A GS VON ELLINGERIS ATTORNEY AND VON ELINGER JANE HAD ONLY SEEN HIM AROUND THE CAPITAL A COUPLE O TIMES SINCE HE RAPED HER HER BLACK CURTAIN WAS SLIGHTLY OPEN TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE LINE OF SIGHT ON JANE DURING THE HEARING MY BODY WAS NOT THERE I JUST HELD SO TIGHT TO MY CHAIR JUST HOLLON TO IT SO I HAD SOMETHING YOOUEVER GET A PROTECTOR VOICE GOID IN SERNO JANE'S VOICE WAS LIGISTRING THE HEARING WAS BROADCAST ON LINE I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CROSS EXAMINED A THE ACCUSE YER THAT'S VON ELINGERIS ATTORNEY PUBLICLY CROSS EXAMINING WITNESSES OF SEXUAL SALT IS CERTAINLY NOT BEST PRACTICE FOR THIS KIND OF THING FOR INSTANCE OTHER STATEBLEGISLATURES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PROCEEDURES FOR HANDLING COMPLAINTS DO NOT ALLOW VICTIMS TO BE CROSS EXAMIDON PUBLIC CERTAINLY NOT BY THE PERPETRATORS THUT AGAIN THEY HAD NO PROCESS FOR THE CINIGHT OHO SO VON ELLINGER'S LAWYER ADOPTED TACTICS OUT OF A CRIMINAL TRIAL HE PREDICTIVELY TURNED JANE INTO THE DEFENDA FOLLOWING THE USUAL PLAYBOOK THAT GETS USED ON SEXUAL ASALT VICTUMS HE CAST HER AS MENTALLY ON STABLE AN A FLIRT WHICH WAS A THING JANE HAD FALL AROUND THE CAPITAL EVER SINCE SHE REPORTED BY LINGER THAT SHE WAS BEING JUDGE AND CAST IN HER WORDS IS A QUOTE GOLD DIGGING CRAZY MEXIC AN POTHEAD VON ELLINGER'S LAWYER NITPICK TINY DETAILS SO INSINUATE THAT MAYBE SHE WAS A LIAR I'M JUST ONDER IF YOU COUN JUST READ THAT JUST AT ONCE SENENCE ON THE NIGHT OF MARCH TEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SHE MET HIM DOWN TOWN BOISY THINK SHEUD BET IT WASN'T MARCH TEN POINT FONING ON WAS IT NO IT WAS MAR NIK TIS AN ETHER YES I TOLD POLICE THAT THEY WHY DID YOU TELL MISS FARON THAT IT WAS MARCHD TO HAN I DIDN'T I SAID THE OTHER NIGHT THIS SUPERVISOR WHO JANE HAD REPORTED TO AS THE ONE WHO ACCIDENTALLY MADE A MISTAKE IN HER RET REPORT NOT JANE MEANWHILE VON ELLINGER BARELY SPOKE HE KEPT PLEADING THE FEFF WHEN THE ETHICS COMMITEE KEPT POINTING OUT THAT THIS WAS NAN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AND IT DIDN'T APPLY HE STILL REFUSED WHAT SUCKED UP MOST OF THE TIME THOUGH WAS THE CORPS OF VONELINGER'S DEFENSE WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY THIS WAS NOT RAT WE WERE DATING ER A DATE WHICH IS ALOUD THERE'S NO ANTI FRATINERSATION POLICY IN THE IDA HOSTATE HOUSE AGAIN HERE'S HIS ATTORNEY TIS REPRESENTED VON ELLINGER HAV ANY HIRING R FIRING AUTHORITY OVER YOU NO THERE'S REPRESENTED VON ELLINGER HAVE ANY SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER YOU NO HE ASKED CON VERSION OF THIS QUESTION MORE THAN THIRTY TIMES TO DIFFERENT WITNESSES  ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY POLICY THAT WOULD BE VIOLATED I REPRESENTATIVE HAVING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH ANIN TURN OF ATEAGE MAJORITY I I I'VE SEEN NOTHING IN POLICY NO THANK YOU HE'S BASICALLY SAYING TELL ME WHERE IT SAS A POWERFUL MIDDLE AGE LEGISLATOR CAN'T DE AND NINETEEN OR OLD IN TURN AND ALWAYS GOT THE SAME ANSWER WRITTEN POLICY NO NOT THAT I'M NOT THAT MOR ABSOLUTELY NOT VON ELINGER'S LAWYER DO THE SAME KIND OF THING WITH THE OTHER WOMAN WHO TASTIFIED ABOUT VON ELLINGER'S TROUBLING BEHAVIOR LIKE A CHIEF CLERK WHO SAID ONE OF HER EMPLOYS COMPLAINED WHEN VONELLINGER ASKED HER OUT HIS ATTORNEY'S RESPONSE TO THA WHIS SHE WASN'T WEARING A WEDDING RING WHICH OF COURSE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER VON ELLINGER SHOULD HAVE ASKED HER OUT AT WORK HIS ATTORNEY CHARGE TO HAD YOU TMHISS SMALL AN YOUR EXPERIENCE ISN'T WEARE IN A WEDDING RING A GENERALLY EXCECTED SIGN THAT A WOMAN IS UNAVAILABLE YOU CAN BE CONCURED THAT WAY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A REQUIREMENT TO BE UNAVAILED AT I DIDN'T ASK IF IT WAS A REQUIREMENT IS IT COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE IN YOUR OPINION FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS INTERESTED IN A WOMAN TO NOTICE THAT SHE IS NOT WEARIN A WEDDING RING AND ASSUME HE'S PERMITTED ASK FOR A QUESTION I DON'T THINK OF A WEDDING RING IS INDICATIVE A WEATHER OR NOT YOU CAN ASK THE WOMAN A QUESTION THIS IS AN ABSURD THING TO ARGUE BUT HE'S ALSO ARGUING AND SIDE AN ABSURD INCOHERENT SAT AF RULES THE IDA WHO LEGISLATURE HAS A PROCESS FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT NOT ACTUALLY A POLICY AGAINST IT IN THE RULES FOR THE SUNNUT IN THE HOUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AN ANTI FRATINERSATION POLICY BUT THEY HAVE RULES ABOUT DECORUM RULES FORBIDDING SMOKING DRINKING AND EATING ON THE HOUSE FLOOR THE RULE ABOUT CONDUCT ON BECOMING OF A STATE LEGISLATOR BUT NOTHING FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE PART OF THE HEARING I'D ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT EVER SINCE I FIRT SAW IT WAS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN JANE FINALLY WALKED AWAY FROM THAT BLACK CURTAIN SHE SAT BEHIND IT FOR FORTY MINUTES ANSWERING QUESTIONS SO YOUR EXCUSE I

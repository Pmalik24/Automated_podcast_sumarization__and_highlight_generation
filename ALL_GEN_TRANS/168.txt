TARGET TAKES A MAJOR MARKET HIT AS CONSERVATIVE'S BOYCOT THE MASS OF CHAIN STORE NEW POLES SHOW DONALD TFRUMS ELECTABILITY NUMBERS OF BELOW WATER AND THE BIDIN WHITEHOUSE TOU SPENDING ON CLIMATE AS MERICANS STRUGGLES TO MAY THE BILLS I'M BENT FERE OF THE SISMENCH BAREOU SHOW  THE SHOWS POSSER BY EXPRESSVY PIAN ITS TIME TO STAND UP AGAINST PIGTAT PROTECT YOUR DADAT EXPRESSIVYPIANDACOMS LASH MEN SO THERE'S A LOT OF TALK THESE DAYS ABOUT WHETHER CONSERVATIVES CAN WIN ANY MORE AND THAT SERIOUS STALK CONSIDERING THAT REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T ONE THE POPULAR VOTE IN ANY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND BEFORE THAT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AS BEEN A VERY LONG TIME SINCE REPUBLICANS REGULARLY ONE POPULAR VOTES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW REPUBLICANS RAN IN THE LATEST RUN OF CENTERE RACES THEY REALLY UNDER RAN WHERE THE UMBER SHULD BIN AN LACE HOUSE RACES THEY SHOUL HAVE WALKED AWAY WITH A FAR BROADER HOUSE MAJORITY SO THERE'S ALWAYS THE SERIOUS QUESTION BYT WHEATHER CONSERVATIVES CANWIN AND THE ANSWER IS YES BUT WORDER TO WIN CONSERT IVE HAL TO REALLY FOLLOW THE RULES OF SALT OLINSKY BECAUSE THOSE RULES WORKS SALL LINSKY OF COURSE WAS THE COMMUNITY ACTIVIST IN CHICAGO WHO BASICALLY PROVIDED THE IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION FOR PEOPLE LIKE HILLRY CLINTIN AND BAROKOMAMA HE WERE A BOOK CALLED RULES FOR RADICALS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE TALGEN ABOUT HOW YOU GO AFTER YOUR POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND WONE OF THINGS THAT HE SAID IS TOYU HAVE TO PERSONALIZE EVERY ISSUE AND IF TO POLARIZE EVERY ISSUE AND YEF TO PUT YOUR YOUR ENEMY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THAT POLARIZATION THAT IS BASICALLY THE GOAL WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS MAKE IT EASY FOR YOUR ENEMY TO POLARIZE YOU WHT YOU WANT TO DO AS MAKE IT HART FOR ENEMY TO MAKE YOU THE TARGET AND MAKE IT REALLY EASY FOR YOUR ENEMY TO BE THE TARGET THAT IS THE WAY TH ACTUALLY WIN AND REPUBLICANS CONSERVATORS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN WHEN WHEN THEY ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THAT RULE WHEN THEY ACTUALLY PERSONALIZE AND POLARIEING THAT'S WHAT THEY DID WITH FOR EXAMPLE TARGET SO FASCINATING THE REPORT OUT FROM THE WALLSTRY JURNAL TITLE TARGET MUCH LIKE BY LIGHT IS STUNG BY CULTURE WARS TARGET DISCOVERED THE CLOST OF IT AND CLAUGHT IN THE MIDLE OF HOTBUTTON SOCIAL ISSIUES IN POLITICALLY DIVIDED UNITED STATES SAILS IT BOTH BUSINESSES FROM TARGET TO BY LIGHT SUFFERED OVER MARKETING EFFORTS THE BACK FIRED AND CAUSED SHOPPERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TOPICS TO CALL FOR BOYCOTTS AND HIS ER BUSH CAME UNDER FIRE FOR A SOCIAL MEDEO PROMOTION WITH A TRANS GENER INFLUENCE SOR TARGET WAS CRITICIZED FOR STORE DISPLAYES MERCHANDIZE FOR PRIDEMONTH THAT INCLUDED GENEROR NEUTRAL SWIMSES THEN WHEN EACH COMPANIES WERE TO BACKED OFFITS ORIGINAL POINT THE ELD ROU BE TEA CUE PLUST OF IDED BY SIMNE COMMUNITY TIFIDED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BOYCOTT IN RETURN TARGETS HAD SHOPPER BACK LASH OVER ITS PRIDEMONTH COLLECTIONS WHILST CAUTIOUS CONSUMERS PUSH SAILS SHARPLY LOWER IN THE MOST RECENT QUARTER THE RETAILERS SAID IT EXPECTS SAILES TO DO CLINE AGAIN IN THE CURRENT QUARTER AND LORDTS PROFITGAL FOR THE FULL YEAR EXECUTIVES SAID HEY WOULD STILL MARK PRIDEMONTH NEXT YOURE BOWITH A MORE FOCUST OSSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE SO THAT WOULD BE A CONSERVAT IF WIN THAT IS A MAJOR CORPORATION THAT IS BACKING OFF OF MUCH OF IT SOCIAL PUSH FOR WILD LEFTISM AN GAIN IF YOU LOOK IT TARGETS SAILES CHANGE YEAR OVER A YEAR WHAT YOU FIND IS IN FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THEY HAD ABOUT THREE PER CENT INCREASE IN SALES OVER THE PRIOR YEAR IN SECOND QUARTER TWENTY TWENTY TO BOUT TWO PER CENT THIRD QUARTER OVER TO PER CENT FOURTH QUARTER THY WERE DOWN TO ABOUT POINT FIVE PER CENT FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE ARE ABOUT ZERO PER CENT PETTY MUCH FLAFT AND THEN SECOND QUARTER ABSOLUTE COLLAPSE YOU SEE AN ALMOST NEGATIVE SIX PER CENT GROWTH RATE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WHICH HE'S A MASSIVE SALES DROP OFF THE STOCK HAD FALLEN ABOUT SIXTEEN PER CENT THIS YEARE THROUGH TUESDAYS CLOSHE BACK LACH SURROUNDING THE PRIDE CLESTION AID INTO SALES PARTICULARLY IN JUNE AFTOR TARGET SALE A STARTED SELLING THE ANUAL COLLECTION STALES WRECOVERED SEDILY IN JULY ACCORDING TO BRYING CORNEL WHOSE TARGET'S LONG TIMEATE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IT'S AN MULTIPLE ECONOMIC PROSS CRUNS ARE PUTTING PRESSURE ON CONSUMERS A TARGET COPPERS CONTINUE TO SPEND LESS ON A PAREL HOME GOODS AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY ITEMS IN THE MIDST OF HIGH PRESSES FOR FOOD ANOTHER A CENTIAL SO PART OF THIS IS JOBIDONS IN FLATIONARY ECONOMY BUT A LOT OF THIS ACTUALLY IS POLITICS ANDTHEWAY THAT YOU CAN TELL THAT IS BECAUSE RETELL RIVAL TCHA ACTS WHICH OWNS TECHA MAX MARTIALS AND HUMGOODS AC SHE SOWGHT SIX PER CENT JUM INCOMPARABLE SALES IN THE SAME QUARTER AND RAISETET SALES GROWTH AT PROPETARGETS FOR THE YEAR SENO THER WRDS MUNCH PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO TARGET INSTEAD WHEN TO TCHA MAX MARSIHALS AND HOME GOODS BY THE WAY MY FAMILY IS ONE OF THOSE FAMLIS USE TO GO TO TARGET ALMOST EVERY SUNDAY TO PICK UP TYO NECESSARY HOUSEHOLD ITEMS WE STOT GOING TOR WENT TO WALMAR INSTEAD IN MAY TARGOT OFFERED PRIDE PRODUCTS FOR SALES AT HOUS FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS BUT THIS TIME THEY DECIDED TO GO WITH A VERY AGGRESSIVE PRIDE DISPLAY THOSE TARGONING CHIDREN AND CONSUMERS REACTED AND THAT CONSUMAREACTION TANKS THEIR SALES AND HERE IS THE THING IN POLITICS IN MARKETCS IT DOESN'T TAKE A MASS MOVEMENT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE CHANGE ALL THAT R QUIERS IS THEY CONSORTED QUARTS OF PEOPLE QOR WILLING TO TAKE A HARD STAND AND A BUNCH PEOPLE OR CENTA WAVORING THAT'S ALL IT REALLY TAKES BUT THE HARD STAND HAS TO BE A POPULAR STAND AY NOT'S POPULAR STAND DON'T TRANS VICADES TO TURNS OUT THAS A REALLY POPULAR STAND FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS VESTMAJORY OF AMERICANS ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF WALKING INTO A TARGET WITH THEIR THREE YEAR OLD AND SEEING BATHING SUITS ENCOURAGING LITTLE BOYS TO TUCK THEIR PEANISTES BENEATH THEM S TAT THEY APPEAR MORE LAKE GIRLS IT' TURNS OUT THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT IN SO TARGET TOOK IT ON THE CHIN AND THIS SHULD BE A LESSON GOING FORT FOR REPUBLICANS PICK PARTICULARLY POPULAR CAUSES AND THEN POLARIZE THOSE CAUSES MAKE CLEAR WHAT THE LEFTS PERSPECTIVE ON THOSE CAUSES IT IS AND WRONG FOOT THE LEFT AND THE LEFT IS PERFECTLY WILIG TO STEP INTOIT BGIS THE LEFT IS RIGHT NOW IN GORGED BY ITS OWN POWER THE LEFT ACTUALLY BELIEVES THAT IT CAN DO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING IN THE UNITED STATES SPECIVICALY BECAUSE THEY'VE WON SO MANY ELECTIONS IN ROLE OR DONE BETTER THAN EXPECTED IN SO MANY ELECTIONS IN ERROW BUT THE THING THAT REPUBLICANS CAMP TO IS MAKE IT HARD FOR THE SENSOR PERSON FOR THE INDEPENDENT FOR EVEN MAYBE THE SLIGHTLY LEFT LEANING PERSON TWO EVEN LOOK AT THEM AND THINK ABOUT VOTING FOR THEM OR THING ABOUT BACKING THEIR CAUSE IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOVERNOR RONDOSAN TOSTID IN FLORIDA THAT HE HASN'T BE E DOING IN THE NATIONAL RAY SO FAR IN FLORIDA THEY'RE A BUNCH OF THE SAN TO STEMOCRATSAS ARE PEOPLE OR VERY HAPPY WITH THE WAY HE RAN THE STATE BECAUSE YE TOOKA REALLY COMMON SENSE DRIVEN PERSPECTIVE WITH REG R TICOVET WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION THES ARE ALL POPULAR ISSUES IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA NOW ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL HE CAN' A RAN AS TRUMP LIGHT HE TOOK MANY OF THE MOST PULLERIZING  SOCIAL ISSUES AND HE DECIDED THAT HE'S COAN TO RUN ALMOST SOLELY ON THOSE AS POST OF SOLID GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA THAT ASTOU MADE HIM QUITE POPULAR WITH DEMOCRATS IN THE STATE OF FLORTED THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT AND NOW LOOKS LIKE TO SIANTIS MAYBE SHIFTING HIS CAMPAIGN AWAY FROM THE  SORT OF TRUMP LIGHT APPROACH WHICH UP IS IS LITTLE LATE BUT NECESSARY OBVIOUSLY IT'S WHY OARE ALSO SEEING SOME POPULAR UPSWING AMONG SOME REPUBLICANS FOR PEOPE LIKE GLAND YOUNG CAN INSURE IN VIRGINIA OR BRYING CEMPAN GEORGIA THEN A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE IDEA THAT IF RE PUBLICANS AND CONSTERVATIVES WISH TO WIN THAN HE'S PICK ISSUES THAT ARE POPULAR AND THE THEY NEED TO RUN ON THOSE ISSUES ALL OF THIS RAISES THE SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE GING TON DO IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR RACE TBECAUSE IF THEY DOSIDE TO ONCE AGAIN HITCH THEIRE WAGON TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION HORSE THAT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A PARTICULARLY SMART TRATEGY WHATEVER SYMPATHY YOU HAVE FOR PRESIDEN TRUMPET OF HUMAN BEING WHO'S BEEN PUT UNDER PRESSURE BY DOZENS OF INDIGHTMENTS VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM ON SPECIOUS CHARGES YOU CAN FEEL THAT SYMPATHYAND YOU CAN STILL UNDERSTAND THAT TALKING ABOUT THAT ENDLESSLY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IS NOT GONE TO RESULT IN VICTORY FOREPUBLICANS WILL GET THAT IN ONE SECOND FIRST SIMPLE FACT THE

FULL S CALE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTIONS AN I ALL RETINE AND THTHIS SORT OF STUFF IT'S THIS SORT OF STUFF THER'RE REALLY GETS THE GOAT OF CONSERVATIVES AND LEADS THEM TO WONE TO THROW THE ORANGEMENTAL FINGER I TOTALLY GET IT HEURE AS TILLARY CLINTON LAST NIGHT CERTAINLY A NTERERN ARRACTION AN IT WITH CLERIINTERFER TERMAN TO HELP MY PONN AN RAANI INTERFRAN ARIRANIN WE KNO AH THAT A PRUN WAS INTANT UPON HELPING TRUMP THAT'S NO LONKER SUBJECT TO DO BAY ME INTERFERE AN WITH THE ELECTION  VIRGINIA JUS STOP YOU SAIN TOCH SCREN COMPETER VOTING BECAUSE IT'S SO VUNERABLE YOU CAN RUN THE BAST CAMPAIGN YOU CAN ETEN BECOME THE NOMENANE AND YOU CAN HAVE THE ELECTION STLIN FROM YO HENO I A THAT TE HES A ELEGENT IMENT PRESEDE ELECTION END IL AFTER ELECTION AND ILE AFTER ELECTION NOW HILLERYCLIN FOR LITERALLY YEARS ON END AND NO ONE SEEM TO CARE ABOUT THAT THAT WAS PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE NOT ONLY WAS A LEGITIMATE IT LAUNCHED A THOUSAND LEGAL CASES AGAINST ON A TRUMP THE MULLER REPORT WAS SPECIFICALLY BASED ON THE IDEA THAT DEMOCRAS COULD NOT HANDLE THE IDEA THAT HILLERY CLIN HAD LOST THE ELECTION THRE'S A PERFECTLY PLAUSIBLE SOLUTION IS TO WHY HILLERY LOST AN TWENTY SIXTEEN SHE WAS ONE OF THE WORST CANDIDATES IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE PROOVE IS THAT YHEU LOST UDONAL TRUMP WHO'S THE SECOND LEAST POPULAR CANDIDATE IN AMERICA AT THAT POINT HILLERY WAS THE LEAST POPULAR AND TRUMP WAS THE SECOND LEAST POPULAR  THAT THAT'S HOW BAD SHE WAS BUT THEY DECIDED INSTEAD SHE MUST NOT HAVE LOST AND SO THEY WANCHED A BUNCH OF LEGAL CASES AGAINST TRUMP AN INVESTIGATIONS BASED ON SPECIOUS NONSENSE AND NOW OF COURSE TRUMP IS FACING SERIOUS CHARGES ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF JURISTICTIONS AND THOSE EN A BOG HIM DOWN FOR LEGITIMATELY THE ENTIRITY OF THE ELECTION CYCLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SLATE OF CASES THE HE IS FACING IT'S CAN BE A FULL SKILL DISASTERAREA FOR HIM MEAN FORGET ABOUT WHETHER HE GOES TO JALENA JUST IN TERMS OF THE POLITIC JUST INTRMS THE MONEY THEY MET THE LEGAL BILLS HERE I HERE IS HIS CURRENT CALNDAR RIGHT NOW HERE THE CASE OF THEIR CALENDAR HE HAS THE NEW YORK MAN HATAN NONSENSE CASE ABOUT HUSH TWENTY PAYMENTS TWO STORMY DANIELS THAT TRIAL IS SCHEDUALS TO BEGIN MARCH TWENTY FIFTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR MEANWHILE THE CLASSFIED DOCUMENTS CASE TIS SLATED TO BEGIN MAD TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR RIGHT IN TE MIDLE OF THE ELECTION CYCLE WE STILL DONT HAVE A DATE ON THE WASHINGTON D C CASE REGARDING JANUARY SIXTH AND TH LEAD UP TO JANUARY SIX FROM JACKSMET BUT HE HAS PROPOSED JANUARY SECONDS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE IYWA PRESIDENTIAL COCASENSE AND FANNY WILLIS ONSALONCH TUR CASE PRESUMABLY WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE INDICTMENT SHE SAYS WHICH WOULDS PUT AT SMACDAB IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO JUST A LOOK AT HIS CALENDAR THAT 'S A STACK TWENTY TWENTY FOUR CALENDER FOR THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES  THAT THAT IS A THAT IS A CALNDAR THAT STARTS OF THA LEGAL CASE IND C IN JANUARY A LEGAL CASE IN GEORGIA IN FEBRUARY A LEGAL CASE IN NEW YORK IN MARCH AND LEGAL CASE IN FLORIDA IN MAY AY THAT THAT'S CAN TO BE THE NTIRITY OF THE YEAR EACH ONE OF THOSE CASESIS GOING TO TAKE MONTHS AT A MINIMUM DONAL TRUMPETS CAN BE CONSUMED WITH THAT DAY AND HE'S CONSUMED WITH THE RIGHT NOW AND THE HAVN'T VEEN LAUNCH THE TRIALS YETS SO HERE IS THEQUESTION WHAT IS TE EVIDENCETHAT THIS IS GOING TO BENEFIT RE PUBLICANSE AGAIN YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH SIMPTHY AS YOU WANT FOR PRESIDEN TRUMP AN I FEEL LOUT OF THE SIME SIMPATHY I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAN WHY THAT IS THE CASE FOR NOMINATING HIM FOR THE PRESIDENCY GIVN THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE THERE'S A PULL OUT TO DAY AND IT SHOWS THAT AGAIN DONALD TRUMP IS SOARING AMONG REPUBLICANS SIXTY THREE PER CENT OF RE PUBLICANS NOW SAY THEY WANT THE FROM AR PRESIDENT TO RUN AGAIN ACCORDING TO NEW POLLING FROM THE A P THAT IS UP SLIGHTLY FROM FIFTY FIVE PER CENT IS HAD THE SAME IN APRIL WHEN TRUMP BEGAN FACING A SERIES OF CREMINAL CHARGES SEVEN AN TEN REPUBLICANS NOW HAVE A FAVORABLE OPINION OF TRUMP AND UP TOCK FROM THE SIXTY PER CENT WHO SAID SO TO MONTHS AGO BY THE WAY THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO WIN REELECTION IF ONLY SEVEN AND TENT RE PUBLICANS ACTUALLY LIKE YOU THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM THAT IS A MAJOR RED FLAG IF JOBIDEMER FACING IN APPROVAL RATING AMONG DEMOCRATS OF SIXTY OR SEVENTY PER CENT WHICH IS WHAT TRUMP IS LOOKING OUT RIGHT NOW THAY'D BE A DISASTER AREA FOR HIM BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM LENCE YOU GET TO THE GENERAL ELECTION THE VOTE IT'S NOT JUS THE MATTER OF GETTING OUT THE BASE THE BASE ISN'T LARGE ENOUGH FOR DONAL TRUMP THIE BASE FOR DONAL TRUMP IS MAY BE FORTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION AT ITS HEIGHT WE GET ALL THOSE PEOPLE OUTS AVOUT THEY KNO THE BOT WONTE YOU'RE STOGAN AN NEET ANOTHER FIVE OR SIX PER CENT OF VOTERS MINIMUM SEECAN GET YOU IN COMPETITIVE RANGE THAT CUT TON COMPETITIVE RANGE IN THE ELECTROAL COLLEGVES OF FORTY SIX PER CENT THAT IS COMPETITIVE IN THELECTRORAL COLLEGE MAYBE TO WIN HE REALLY NEDS MORE LIKE FORTY EIGHT PER CENTS SO WHERE'S THAT OTHER EIGHT PER CENT CON TO COME FROM THEU'D HAVE TO THEORETICALLY COME FROM INDEPENDENTS OR DEMOCRATS TO SATISFIED WITH GOBIDON BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM LOOK AT THOSE POLL NUMBERS SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT OF REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAT NUMBER ITSELF IS WAG TO LO THA MEANS A FULL QUARTER OF REPUBLICANS WOULD SIT IT OUT RATHER THAN VOTE FOR TRUMP IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FIFTY THREE PER CENT OF AMERICANS SAY THEY WOULD DEFINITELY NOT SUPPORT HIM IF HE IS DENOMINEE WHICH MEANS THE ELECTION IS OVER IF THAT'S THAT IS REAL IF A PURE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SAY THEY WILL NEVER VOTE FOR YOU UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES HOW DO YOU WIN YOEU CAN'T LOSE FIFTY THREE PER CENT OFTE VOTE AND WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION ANOTHER ELEVEN PER CENT THAT THEY PROBABLY WOULD NOT SUPPORT HIM IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHICH LEADS TO SIXTY FOUR PER CENTS OF AMERICAN SAYING THAT THEY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT OR PROBABLY WOULD NOT VOTE FOUR DONAL TRUMP IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WHAT IS THE CASE THAT THIS IS SUDDENLY GOING TO TURN BASED ON THE INDICTMENTS TAT THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT THE INDICTMENTS AND THE INJUSTICE OF THE NETMENTS WAS TRUE THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT THAT THE MORE PEOPLE WILL RALLY TO DONAL TRUMS CAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE ECHO CHAMBER KIND OF STUFF TO ME AND THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE IN MY INDUSTRY OR GAN A FIB TO YOU AND TELL YOU TH T THE MORE YOU TALK ABOUT THIS THE MORE POPULAR DONAL TRUMP WILL BE COM I DO NOT SEE THE EVIDENCE OF THAT IF THAT WERE TE EVIDENCE I WOULD TELL YOU I PROMISE YOU BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A REPUBLICAN REPLACE GOBIDON TAND IF THAT REPUBLICAN IS DONAL TRUMP THAT'S FINE BUT THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS THAT I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE DATA HND N THE IT'S VERY EASY FOR PEOPLEL TO ONE TO BLIND THEMSELVES TO REALITY BEAUSE THEIR FEELINGS ON THESE TOPICS ARE SO STRONG BY THE WAY THIS NT HAVE SERIOUS DOWN BALLAD FFECTO IY LEST WE FORGET DONAL TRUMP DID JUST LOSE THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION HE ALSO LED TO ADDITIONAL LOWSES IN PLACES LIKE GEORGIAN TWENTY TWENTY ONE GEORGIA IS A RED STATE IT IS A RED STATE HOW DO I KNOW CS BRAN CAP CRUSHED STACY APRUMS IN HIS LAST GUBENY TORIAL RUN THE LEGISLATUR IN GEORGIA IS RED AND YET IT HAS TWO DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHY BECAUSE DONAL TRUMPLAS A DRAG ON THE CENETORIAL BALLAD YOU'S A MASSIVE DRAG NOT PERSON TWENTY TENTY ONE BUT ALSO IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN HE HAND PICT TERSIAL WALKER ANDTEN HERSHAL WALKER RAN BASICALLY ON TWENTY TWENTY AND TURNS OUT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT SORT OF STUFF IT ALSO TURNS OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA ARE NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HEARING THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN AND THAT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN AN ELECTION IN GEORGIA SO I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE ANGRY AT MY PENCE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT PENCE SHOULD BE STANDING STRONGER WITH TRUMP AGAINST LEGAL ANS ATMINES I ALSO UNDERSTAND MHY PENCS VIEW ON SOME OF THE STUFFWHICHES WELL I WAS ONE THET DONAL TRUMP WAS SAYING COULD STOP THE ELECTION FROM ACTUALLY BEING CERTIFIED WHICH IS FALSE AND THEN PEOPLE WORE THREATENG FOR KILL ME SO I'M NOT SUPERHOT ON THAT BUT WHEN MIHT PEN SAYS THE GEORGIA ELECTION WAS NOT STOLEN HE HAPPENS TO BE CORRECT THE EVIDENCE IS NOT THERE NOW DOS FRUM SAYS HIS GAN PRESENT A SLATE OF NEW EVIDENTS ON MONDAY NO AS I THINK I DON'T THINK HE ACTUES CAN PRESENT THE SLATE OF BRAND NEW EVIDENCE THAT TOTALLY SHAKES THINGS UP AND HE'S GEEN PREVENT PRESENT AN AN AWFUL LOT A SPECULATION AND RE WARMED SORT OF MIKREL WAVABLE LEFT OVERS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXAMINED NONE OF THESE THINGS BEEN FILED IN COURT WHAT THAT REALLY IS MORE ABOUT IS ESTABLISHING THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE REQUISITES IN TEND TO COMMIT THE CRIME THAT HE IS BEING CHARGED WITHIN THE TATE OF GEORGIA HE'S GOINS TO I LEGITIMATELY BELIEVE DIS DEPRIVED OF THE ELECTION EVEN IF I'M WRONG SO I LUGITIMATELY BELIEVE IT THAT'S REALLY WHAT MONDAY I THINK IT IS MORE ABOUT HE SUFFICES SAY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU CAN WIND GEORGIA AS H PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AFTER SAYING OVER AND OVER AND OVER THAT EVERY ELECTION IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA IS RIGGED AGAINST YOU AND RIPPING ON THE POPULAR GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA IN THE PROCESS TRYING TO PRIMARY HIM WITH DAVID PURDU WHO THEN GOT WIPED OUBT BY LIKE FORTY POINTS IN TH PRIMARIES GET'TO MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST WE HAVE A WONDERFUL DOGO HIS NAME IS HAPPY HAPPY IS JUST THE

PEOPLE BEHIND TWO THOUSAND MULES THEY ASK THEM FOR THE EVIDENCE OF THE CHARGES THAT DAY HAD BEE CONSTANTLY MAKING AND TRUE VOTE ASKED THEM TO STOP ASKING I SO HEREIS MY PEN SAYING THE THING THAT YOU'RE NOT POST TO SAY APPARENTLY O SPI WERE THE FORMER PERSEDENI O I  SA FOR NO MORE THAN TWO F  THE GEORGIA ELECTION W O NO STOLEN AND I HAD NO RIGHT TO OVER TURN THE ELECTION OF ON GANDAR OR I HEY HAVEN'T TO BE CORRECT ABOUT THAT BUT HERE'S THE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THING A PRESIDENT WHO KEEP SAYING OVER AND OVER THAT GEORGIA STEELS ELECTIONS IS NOT LIKELY TO DO A MAZING AN ELECTIONS ESPECIALLY CHAS REPUBLICAN VOTERS IN GEORGIA MAY SAY WHILE IF THE ELECTIONS CAN GET STOLEN ANYWAY WHY DO I BYTHER GOING THE PULSE AGAIN THE ONE QUESTION THAT TRUMP REALLY HAS NOT ANSWERED TO HAVING ANY ONE SATISFACTION IF THEIR WATCHING IS YOU SAY THE LAST ELECTION WAS STOLEN YOU ONE BUT WHOS STOLEN FROM YOU HOW DO YOU PLAN ON PREVENTING THAT THIS TIME EVERY CANS THATYOU PUT UP FOR SECRETARY OF STATEIN THE VARIOUSTATS LOST SO HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY PLAN ON STOPPING OF THE STEEL THIS TIME IF DEBOUT STOPPING THE STEEL TRUMPCHU SAYS WE'LL STOP IT A YOU D WITH BUT AT SOME POINT IF YOU MAKE A CLAIM THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN YOU SHOULDHVE A PLAN TO STOP ALL THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE SORTS OF PLAMES ARE NOT CHEST RIPPING A PART REPUBLICAN PARTY AN A NATIONAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF WHO THEY NOMINATE THEYARE RIPPING A PART STATE PARTIES SUVE LOK OF THE ARIZONA STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY I'S IN A STATE OF TDI SARAY BECAUSE HALF OF THE ARIZONA STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ALWAYS STRUMP THE OTHER HALF IS NOT SO HOT ON TRUMP VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE SORT OF POLITICOS IN ARIZONA LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHOHAVE BEEN NOMINATED FOR VARIOUS POSITIONS IN ARIZON AND THIT'S WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING ARIZONA JUST A FEW YEARS AGO AS A STATE WITH THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS AND OW HIS DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR IN TWO DEMOCRATIC SENATORS SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE OF VICTORY THAT'S NOT PICKING THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA AND FOCUSSING IN ON THOSE ISSUES LIKE A LAZERBEM THAT'S FOCUSSING IN ON MARIK COPLIC COUNTY AUDIST WHICH BY THE WAY THAT AUDI RESULTED IN MORE VOTES FOR JOBIDON THAN IT DID FOR VOTES ADDED FOR DONAL TRUMP AND Y IS FOCUSSING IT ON CARRY LAKES BEZAR CRIXOTIC QUEST TO RECLAIM THE GOVERNORSHIP OF ARIZONA ON THE BASIS OF PRESUMABLY NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE CAN ACTUALY PRESENT IN COURT AND WIN WITH WHAT IS THAT WHAT THEY WONE WRUN ON AN WHAT IS THE PLAN HERE AD WHEN YOU TAUGHTS PEOPLE IN ARIZONA WHERE IN THE ARIZON GIOPE THER'R TURRING THEIR HAIR OUT BECAUSE THEYRE MON THEIR MONEY RAISING IS GONE THEIR FUN RAISING IS GONE ALLOWT F THEIR GROUND GAME IS GONE BECAS BEEN DEDICATED TO THES SORCE OPS NOT JUST TO ARIZONA BY THE WAY MICHIGAN IS GETTNG TORN APART RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF ALL THIS ACCORDING TOTHE WALSTRY JOURNAL WHEN A FIGHT BROKE OUT AT A CLOSED DOOR MEETING OF THE MICHIGAN GIO PESTATE COMMITTEE A KICK TO THE GOIN AND BROKEN DENSURES INTRRUPT THE DISCUSSION OF THE DISMAL FINANCES OF THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE ALTERCATION LAST MONTH AT THE DORTY HOTEL IN CLAIR MICHIGAN MADE CLEAR THE MICHIGAN REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW DOMINATED BY ITS RIGHT FLANK STAUNCHLLY ALINE BEFORE A PRESIDENT TRUM HAS DE SENDED INTO CHAOS IT CAN BARELY FON RAYS IT HAS ALL BUT GONE BROKE STATE WAW MAKERS HAVE TAKENS RAISING MONEY ON THEIR OWN UNABLE TO RELY ON THE PARTY AT A TIME WHEN RE PUBLICANS ARE SEEKING TOR A CLAMA MAJORITY IN THE TATE LEGISLATURE AND PREPARE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION IN MICHIGAN A CRUCIAL PRESIDENTIAL SWING STATES MICHIGAN CIO PES IN FIGHTING IS AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF THE DISFUNCTION IN MANY STATES AS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE REPUBLICANS WHO USED TO TO FIND THE PARTY GAVE WAY TO POPULAUS OR DEEPLY SCEPTICAL OF HEULEADES AND INSTITUTIONS O POWER NOW YOU COULD MAKE COMMON CAUSE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS THE SO CALL CHAMBER OF COMMERCSYO PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARABOUT BUSINESS CLIMATEED STATES THEYREN HAVE TO BE AT ODDS WITH THE SO CALLE POPULIST BUT WHAT YOU DO NEED TO DO IS PICK ISSUES THAT OR CANDIDATES CAN WIN ON AND THEN RUN THE PARTIES IN ORDER TO W N THE ELECTIONS WHAT DON'T UNDERSTAND IES THE THE PARTY POLITICAL PARTIES BELIEVE IT ARE NOT ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO YOUR POSITORIES OF PRINCIPAL PINCIPALLY THAT'S REALLY NOT WITH THEREABOUT POLITICAL PARTIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT VICTORY THEY ARE VEHICLES FOR VICTORY I EXPLAIN IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST THE BENSHI PERO SHO IS SUPPORTED BY GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY AND A FORDABLE PRIVATE CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY WITH VIBRIN CAMPAS AND BEAUTIFUL PHENIX ARIZONA THAT IS A RANK TOP TWENTY IN THE CONTRY ACCORDING TO NICH DOT COM I'VE BEEN TO G CU IT IS A GORGEOUS CAMPAS AND MAN THAT OTLANDSCAPE IS JUST VICTACULAR G C U IS A MISSIONAL CHRIST SENTED UNIVERSITY THAT STRIVES TO PHOSTER CULTURE OF COMMUNITY GIVING AN IMPACT G C U SGHOOL IS TO HELP YOU DEVELOP INTO AT SERVAN LEADER WHO MAKES A DIFFERENCE THROUGH FINDING YOUR PURPOSE AND

WORLD VIEW INS YOUR BASTELORS MASTERS OR DOCTORS DEGREE FIND YOUR PURPOSE AT GRAN CANYON UNIVERSITY PRIVATE CHRISTIAN AF FORDABLE VISIT G C U DOT E D U TO DAY HITSO POLITICAL PARTIES USE TO BE VEHICLES FOR VICTORY WHAT THAT MEANT IS THAT YA THERE WERE A SET OF PARTY BOSSES AND THOSE PARTY BOSSES FOCUST IN VERY HEAVILY ON WHO COULD WIN ELECTIONS THEN IN A POPULAST MOVE A LOT OF THESE PARTIESE DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN DECIDED TO DEVOLVE MORE AUTHORITY TO THE VOTING POPULATION INSIDE THE PARTIES WITH THOT THEN IS THE BEST TO ORGANIZED POSITIONS INSIDE THOSE PARTIES WERE LIKELY TO WIN BTHE BEST ORGANIZED POSITIONS WERE OFTEN HELD BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAD VERY VERY STRONG POSITIONS ALL THAT IS FINE IF THERE IS A COUNTER BALANCE WHICH ASKS THE QUESTION OF WHO CAN WIN HOWEVER WHEN THE PARTY BECOMES A NON PROFIT THEN GOT A PROBLEM CAN IN THE NON PROFIT WERE WHERE'S THE WAY THE NON PROFIT WORK WORLD WORKS IN GENERAL I KNOW USE TO WORK FOR CONSERVERED NON PROFIT NON PROFITS WORK TO LOSE CAY THIS IS VERY OFTEN THE CASE NON NON FOR EVERYBODY THERE LOT NON PROFITS OING A MAZING WORK BUT THE GENERAL NON PROFIT MODEL THE METRIC OF SUCCESS IS WHAT WHAS AN PROFIT IS NON PROFIT RIGHT HE METRIC OF SUCCESS FOR DAILY WIRE IN TERMS OF MARKS WE HAVE TO IT IS AUDIEN SIZE AND MONEY EARN CAUSE WE ARY BUSINESS AND WE HAVE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE THAT IS THE MILLIO IN WHICH WE WORK NON PROFITS ARE DESIGNED NOT TO MAKE MONEY SO HOW DO THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THEIR MONEY THE WAY THAT THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY IS BY MAGNIFYING THE PROBLEM WHAT HAPPENS TO A NON PROFIT IF THE PROBLEM IT IS  DESINGD TO FIGHT GOES AWAY WIK WHAT HAPPENS BY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ARE A NON PROFIT WHAT SA NON PROFIT THAT IS DEDICATED TO SCHOOL VAUCHERS AND LET TAT THE SCHOOL FVAUCHERS ACTUALLY  GET DONE BET THE SCHOOL OVACHERS ACTUALLY WORK YOU GET THEM WELL THEN PRESUMABLY YOU JUST CANNOT GO BACK TO YOUR DAY JOB SO NON PROFITS VERY OFFEN ARE INTERESTED IN THE PROBLEM OF MAGNIFYING THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM AND PRESENTING IT AS VE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM IN HUMAN HISTORY WELL IF YOU ARE THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY YOURGAL IS TO WIN ELECTIONS THAT SHOULD BE OUR GORIGHT THAT WAS YOUR METRIC OF SUCCESS BUT WHAT IF THE METRIC FOR SUCCESS CHANGES ANDTHE METRIC OF SUCCESS IS NO LONGER WINNING WHICH WOULD BE ACTULLY MESURABLE AN IF IT WERE NEASURABLE YOU'D BE PUNISHED FOR NOT HITTING THOSE METRICS RIGHT WHEN PEOPLE AT DAILY WIRE DON TO THEIR JOB THEY GET FIRE WHEN PEOPLE AN NON PROFITS DON'T DO THEIR JOB VERY OFTEN THY JUST STICK AROUND AND CLAIM THAT THE PROBEN THEIR FIGHTING HAS GOTT WORSE THAY THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK MORE LIKE CAN ELL ELL SEE THAN AN ON PROFIT IN OTHER WORDS EITHER DELIVERS VICTORY OR EVERYBODY GETS THEIR ASPOOTED OUT THE DOOR BUT LATELY THAT'S NOTTHEC WAY THAT T'S WORKING IF YOU LOSE YOU STICK AROUND AND OU CLAIM THAT YOU'R THAT YOU HAVE TO STAY AND THAT YOU LOST BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS JUST OBEY IN FACT EVERYTIME YOU LOSE THE PROBLE GETS YOUVEN BIGGER WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE EVEN MORE NECESSARY BUT THEN YOU LOSE BUT THT'S BECAUSE PROMISE GETTING EVEN BIGGER AND ARE EVEN MORE NECESSARY BUTHATS JUST BECAUSE THE POM ISE GETTING EVEN BIGGER WHICH IS WHY YOU LOSE YOU SEEI'S AN ENDLESS CYCLE OF USELESSNESS ANDTHAT'S A REAL PROBLEM BECAUSE AGAIN MEANWHILE DEMOCRATS OURE WINNING THEN DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS A PARTY THAT IS DEDICATED TO VICTORY WHICH IS WHY THEY HAVE BEN WINNING CONSISTENTLY NOW YOU COULD DESIGNE HA PARTY WITH AN APPARATUS THAT ACTUALLY IS ORIENTED TOWARD VICTORY I THAT'S HAPPEN IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA WHERE THE PARTY IS ORIENTED TOWARD TAKING POLITICAL POSITIONS THAT ARE VICTORIOUS ACROSS A ABROAD SUATH OF THE POPULATION FOR EXAMPLE THERE OTHER STATES THAT DO THIS TO S NOTTUS FLORIDA THE NEWYORK REPUBLICAN PARTY ACTUALLY OUT DID ITSELF IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE BY NOMINATING A SERIES OF PRETY GOOD CANDIDATES IN SWING SEATS AND ALSO PURSUING REDISTRICTING THT WAS VERY HELPFUL BUT IF YOU HAVE STATE R PUBLICAN PARTYIES THEY'VE BASEDLY DECIDED THAT THAT THEIR GOAL IS TO JUST YELLA AT THE PROBLEM ALOT AND THE LOUDER THEY YELL THE MORE THEY LOSE WHICH MEANS THAT TO YELL EVEN LOUDER WHICH MEANS THEY LOSE THEN HOW EXACTLY TO THEY PLAN TO ACHIEVE VICTORY HERE I DON'T SEE THE PLAN GIVE ME THE PLAN AND MAY BE ALLSIDE WITH YOU BUT I'M NOT SEEING THE PLANRIGHT NOW ANSEING IS PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE BUT THE LOUDER THEY YELL THE MORE THE PROBLEM  GET SOLVED THAT IS NOT HOW ANY PROBLEM IN YOUR LIFE HAS EVER BEEN SOLVED IS THE HINY POLITICAL PROBLEM GET SOLVED EITHER THAT IS A MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A POPULIS GRASTROS MOVEMENT IN FAVER OF A POSITION ON A TOPIC THAT IS POPULAR THAT IS HOW YOU WIN THE PARENTS MOVEMENT IS A VERY CONSERVATIVE POSITION IT'S SUPERCONSERVATIVE IT'S OW YOU UND UP WIT THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA GLEN YOUNKEN THAT WAS A VERY CONSERVATIVE  MOVEMENT BUT WHY IT WAS DRIVEN AT A PAREN POPULATION THAT JUST DID NOT WANT SEXUAL INDOCTRINATION OF KITS THEY PICKED AN ISSUE AND THEY POLERIZED IT I'LL TLL YOU THE ONE ISSUE THAT IF REPUBLICANS RUN IN INT THEY WILL GET SKUNKED IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THAT IS TE ELECTION OF TWENTY TWENTY IF THE EECTON OF TWENTY TWENTY IS WHAT THEY CHOOSTER ONON AND TWENTY

OCAN MEANWHILE ACAN THE BIGGEST ISSUE HERE IS JOBIDON'S ECONOMY WHICH IS FAILING FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEAMERICAN PUBLIC OF EXPERIENCED MASS IN FLATION UNDER JOBIDON AND THENCRAST YOU TRYING TO HAP YOU TALK THIS THING CHUXHUMER WHO IS IN EXLICABLY THE SENATE  MAJORITY LEADER A HE SAID TO DAY THAT OUR ECONOMY IS DOING JUST FANTASTICALLY WELL AS OF YESTERDAY MOST ECNOMIST FEAR THE MOST IN THE FUTURE AND IT'S TWO THINGS ONE THE SINEST ECONOMY THIS WEAKENING TOO QUICKLY AND THAT WILL HAVE IN PACT ON EXPORT SIMPORT AND TRO THAT THE UNINES FATES ECONOMY IS TWO STRONG IT IS OUR ECONOMY IS DOING SO WELL AND ITS IN GOOD PART BHECAUSE OF THE WORK WE IN THE SENATE IN THE PRESIDENT DID OVER THE LAST SUMMER THE INFOR STRUCTURE BILL THESHIPS AND SCIENCES BILL AND  TO DAY WERE SELEBRATING THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY THE AYE AREATY PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF LEGISLATION THIS CAN PASSINCE THE SINCE THE GREAT SOCIETY E W HE HE KEEPS TOLKING OW WONDERFUL THE ECONOMYIS WHICH IS WEIRD SINCE THE US MORTGAGE RAT IS NOW SEVEN POINT ONE SIX PER CENT THIS MATCH OF THE HIGHEST RATE FROR MORTGAGES SINCE YO THOUSAND ONE IS TRIMPING BOTH SAILS AND REFINANCING ACTIVITY THE CONTRACT RATE ON A THIRTY YOU'RE FIXED ROSE SEVEN BASEST POINTS TO SEVEN POINT ONE SIX PERCENTS IN THE WEAK ENDING AUGUST OLEVENTH THE LATEST JUMPIN BORROWING CLOSS PRESENTS THE FRESH HEAD WIND FOR THE HOUSING MARKET JUST AS TE SECOR HAD BEEN SHOWING SIGNS OF FINDING ITS FOOTINGS WE HAVE CREDICARDAT THAT IS STACKING UP WE HAVE PEOPLE WHERE NO CAN BE ABLE TO BUY NEW HOMES WHICH MEANS THAT THE PRICE IS EVENTUALLY ARE GOING TO DROP BECAUSE THE MARKET IS GOING TO DROP WHICH MEANS THERE WILL BE PEOPLE FOR UNDERWATER ON THEIR OWN HOMES WHICH SUCH US UP FOR ANOTHER REAL ESTATE PROBLEM MEANWHILE THERE'S A RISING RISK OF BANKT DOWN GRANDES ACCORDING TO THE HILL THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM AS WELL OBVIOUSLY FITCH RATING'S ANNALIS CRIST WULF HAS WORND THAT DOZENS OF YOSPENTS INCLUDING CHAPY MORTGAN CHASE COULD FASE DOWN GRADES IF THE RATING AGENCIES TO SUSSMENT OF THE INDUSTRYSELF TE CLINES A LITTLE BIT FURTHER WOLF IS THE LEAD AUTHOR ON FITCHER'S COMMENTARY WHEN THE RATING AGENCY LOWERED IT TO OPERATNG ENVIRONMENT SCORE FOR YOSBANKS FROM A DOUBLEA TO A DOUBLA MINESS IN JUNE IF FITCH DOWN D GRATES THE INDUSTRY SCORE EVEN FURTHER FROM  DOUBLA MINUS TO A PLUS THE AGENTCSUED THEN BE FORCRY VALUAT RATINGS ON EACH OF THE MORE THAN SEVENTY BANKS IT ACTUALLY COVERS AND THEN IF INSTITUTIONS LIKE SHAPY MORGAN ARE CUT FITCH WOULD HAVE TO LEASE CON SIDERED DOWN GRADE IS ON ALL OF ITS PEERS RATINGS SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS THE REAL POSSIBILITY OF A MASSIVE ECONOMIC PROBLEM COMING AND MEANWHILE TROBIDN JUS KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW HOW WONDERFUL YOU HAVE IT HOW INCREDIBLE THINGS ARE REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY NEARLY FULL TIME AT THIS POINT AGAIN THAT THAT IS WERE THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC DOES NOT APPROVE OF JOBIDAN'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE MEAN AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT JOBIDONS APPROVAL RATING RIGHT NOW TOPIC BY TOPIC ON THE ECONOMY HE IS GETTING ABSOLUTELY SKUNKED IT IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM FOR HIM AND YET SOMEHOW REPUBLICANS ARE NOT FOCUSSING IN ON THAT WHICH I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FOCUSING ON EVERYTHING ELSE AGAIN AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU HAVE TO YOU AVE TO WONDER ABOUT THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS ACORDING TO IPSOS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE BY A WITH A BULLET LIKE TWENTY PER CENTS OF AMERICANS COUNT THE ECONOMY ON EMPLOYMENT AN JOBS AS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FACING THE COUNTRY FOLLOWED BY CRIME AND CORRUPTION AND THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT THAT REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE HAMERING THE THIRD ISSUE THEY SAY IS ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE BUT THE FOURTH IS IMMIGRASION REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS AND IN APENNANCE ALL SAY THAT THE ECONOMY IS THE TOPISSU THESE ARE AND BY THE WAY ALL AMERICANS SIXTY NINE PER CENT OF AMERICAN SAY THAT THE COUNTRYES HAD IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THEY WERE ON THE WRONG TRACK WOULDN'T THAT BE EVIDENCE THAT REPUBLICANS CAN WIN IF THE REFOKIS A LITTLE BITHERE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY WILL OR WHETHER THEY WILL NOT MEANWHILE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONSTINUES TO PROP UP YOU KNOW ELDERLY SEENILE PEOPLE HERE I'M SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT DIAN FINE STIN IN FACT THRE'S A BRAN NEW COURT FILING OUT FROM THE DAUGHTER OF DIAN FINE STIN ALLEGING THAT SHE IS ACTHULY THE VICTIM OF ELDER ABUSE ACCORDING TO IS THE SAN FRANCISCO GAE DICOM

MADE FOR HERS TO SHE ARE HER VOTE IS MAKING YOUR FINANTIAL DECISIONS FOR YOU BUT SHE IS HAVING ALL HER FINANCIAL DECISIONS MADE BY TRUSTEES AT THIS POINT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE O THIF WE HAVE APPOINTED TO THE HIGHEST POSITIONS O POWER IN AMERICA MEANWHILE NEXT WEEK IS GON BE THE FIRST REPUBLICAN IT DEBATE PRESIDEN TRUMP ITS PUTTNG THE ARNS HE AN BIT OF A BIND HE IS REFUSED TO SIGN THE ARANS HE LOYALTY PLEDGE HE SAID THAT LAST WEEK HE'S EXPECTES TO ANANCEMEN COMING DAYS WHETHER OR NOT HE'S GOING TO ATTEND THE EVENT IT'S VERY UNLIKELY I THINKG THAT HE IS GOING TO ATTEND THE EVENT ACCORDING TO THE HELL ARINS E CHAIR WOMAN A RON OUT ROMINY MACTANIAL BUS NOW NAVIGATE THE THORNY SITUATION OF APPEASING TRUMP WHELL MAINTAINING HER CON TROLS HEAD OF THE PARTY BRIAN SYCHIC A REPUBLICAN STRATAGIST AND TRUMP CAMPANAL ONE SAYS HIT'S A DISTINC POSSIBILITY THE REPUBLICAN NOMINY FOR PRESIDENT COULD SIMPLY DECIDE TO SHUN THE ARAN HE ITSELF WHEN  CANSIDATE REFUSES SUPPLAY BY THE RULES AT OBVIOUSLY REA WEAKENS THE ARANS HE'S POSITION BUT HERE'S THE REALITY DONTRUPLE AS NEVER ON A SIGNDM AGREEMENT LIKE THIS AND FRANKLY I THINK IT'S KEN OF A DUM THING BECAUSE IT NO MATTER WHAT DONAL TRUMP SAYS CAN HE BE HELD TO IT WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE DOESN'T IF HE SIGNS THE PLEDGE AN THE LATERIES LIKE I MEANT EVERYBODY BUT CRIS CRISTY THEN WHAT IS HEN  MAN TO DO ABOUT IT LIKE THE ANSWER IS NOTHING MAC DANIEL TOLD SEAN ANS CRIST WALLAS RECENTLY IT'S BEAT BIDIN PLEDGE AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING AND THE BATE COMMITEE HAS MET FOR OVER TWO YEARS PEOPLE FROM LAST GODTAILE ANNOYS TOT TENNESSE IS IF FIR CON A STAND ON THE ARANS HE DEBATE STAGE HO SHOULD BEABLE TO UPPORT THE NOMINY AND BEAT BIDON EVERYBODY HAS TO SIGNE THE BEAT BINE PLEDGE EVERYBODY IT'S A CROSS THE BOARD THE PLEDGE STATES THE CANDIDATE WILL SUPPORT THE EVENTUAL NOMINY OF THE PARTY PRIMARY AND THE CANDIDATE WILL NOT PART TISIPATIN ANY DEMATE THE ARANS HE HAS NOT SANCTIONED THE PLEDGE IS PART OF A CRITERIOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES MUST MEET TO QUALIFY FOR THAT PRESEDANTIAL DEBATE BUT AGAIN IN AUGUST TWENTY FIFTEEN THEN CANDIDATE TRUMP AS THE ONLY CANDIDAT ON STAGE ONE OF THE BATES WHO WOULDN'T RAISE HIS HAND TO SHOW THT HE WOULD UPPORT THE EVENTUAL NOMINY IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN PRIMARY AND THE SOMETHING KIND OF WRONG WITH THIS G  IS JUST A GENERAL RULE IF WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT IS REPUBLICANS WINNING THUT YOU'D LIKE SEETROBID NOPY AN OFFICE THE FACT THAT LOYALTY ONLY RUNS ONE WAY THAT THERE IS JUST EXPECTED LOYALTY FROM EVERYBODY TWO TRUMP AT THE MINUTE THAT TRUMP ITS ASKED WHETHER HE'L SUPPORT ANOTHER NOMINE IF THAT PERSON BEATS HIM HE RE FUSES TO RAISE SAN AN CANNIS SHOWS YOU WEAR THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW THE ONLY REASON THERE WAS HE NEEDS DOA LOYALTY PLEDGEAS BECAUSE OF DONAL TRUMP SAID ALEC STRUMMAN AND REPUBLICAN STRATGIST AN ARINS EALOMBA THAT'S NOT TRUE OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE TRUMP HIMSELF HAS SOR OF  REFUSED TO SE IT TO SIT I SIGN ON THE DOUTED LINE RIGHT NOW I MEAN IT'S IT'S TRUMP THAT EVERYBODY IS AFRAID OF HERE IT'S NOT THAT OTHE REPUBLICANS AE CAN HAVE TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TRUMP THEY DIDN'T TWENTY TWENTY IT' WHETHER DONAL TRUMP TS WLLING TO SUPPORT THE PARTY IF HE'S NOT THE PERSON WHO'S IN CHARGE GENER FOR HORN WHO IS A SPOKES PERSON FOR TRU P SHE SAYS THE IRONS SE MEENS TRUMP ALOUT MORE THAN TRUMPNEAS THE IRON SEE IF THEY LOSE TRUMP THY LOSE THE SPORT OF THE TRUMP VOTERS IN THEIR BASEFIRT SENT OF CANDIDATES THAT HOUSE CANDIATES THEIR STAKE CANDIDATES TLORN ALSO SAID THAT A TRUMP TO SIDES TO BAY WITHOUT SIDING TH PLEDGE THE OTHER CANDIDATE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME TREATMEN SO WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS HADS HONESTLY A DEBATE WITHOUT TRUMP ON THE STAGE IS VERY LIKELY TO BENEFIT SOME OF THE FRINGE YAR CANDIDATES BECAUSE AGAIN THOSE CANDIDATES ARE GOU B ABLE TO FREE WHEEL AND THE'RE NOT CAN BE THE TIRIAN OF ATECTS IF TRUMPER ON THE STAGE PRESUMABLY SOME OF THEOTHER CANDIATES WOULD GO AFTER TRUMP ANDTHEYGH IE TURN INTO A BRAWL IF HE'S NOT THEN IT'LL TURN INTO THE LOBSTER POT RIGHT THE CRABPOTES CAN BE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TRYING TO DRAG DOWN THE NEAREST COMPETITOR PRESUMABLY THAT MEANS RONTO SANSIS WILL TAKE THE BRUNTS OF THE INCOMING IN THE DEBATE NEXT WEEK SOL CONTINUED BRING YOU THE LATEST ON ALL OF THAT AGAIN IN THE NATIONAL PULLING TO SANSIS IS STILL RUNNING SECOND BUT HIS NUMBERS HAVE DECLINE RELATIVELY MARKETLY ALTHOUGH CORN QUINNIBYAC HE STILL UP AT ABOUT EIGHTEEN PER CENTS WHICH PUTS HIM THIRTY NINE PER CENT PERCENTIVE POINTS BEHIND TRUMP IN IWELL FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH HE IS TRAILING RIGHT NOW IN THE REAL CROPOLITICS PULLING HAVERAGE BY TWENTY SEVEN POINTS FORTY FOUR TO SEVENTEEN SO WELL CONTINUED BRING YOU LATEST ON ALL OF THAT ALREADY TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AND THEN SOME THINGS THAT I HATES SO THINGS I LIKE TODAY I SAID ER EARLIER THE BIDIN FAMILY IS DEEPLY CORRUPT AN HAS BEEN FOR FORTY YEARS THE BEST BOOK ON THIS IS BOOK BY REPORTN HIM BEN SHRECKENGER CALLE THE BIDINS INSIDE THE FIRST FAMILIES FIFTY YEAR RISE TO POWER HE GOES THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THE ENTIRE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JOE AND HUNTER JOE AND FRANK JOE AND JIM THEY SITLY HAS SINCE THE EARLIEST DAYS OF JOE BIDONS RISE TO POWER HE WAS USING THAT POWER IN WAYS THE BENEFITED MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY AND HIS MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY WE'RE USING JOBIDON'S NAME AN ORE TO GET AHEAD AND IT IS A CONSISTENT PATTERN AND I TO ALWAYS THE SAME MEANS LITERALLY THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER JOBIDING IS A SHADOWY BACKGROUND FIGURE BEING USED BY MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN BENEFITES FOR THEMSELVES AND THEN HIM DENYING THAT EVER KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT ANDTHIS RANGERS FROM EVERYTHING TO FUN RAISING TO THE KIND OF JOBS IF HE WAS ABLETO GET HUNTER COMING OUT OF COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL IT IT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE HOW HE PRESUMABLY HELPED HIS BROTHER OBTAIN FINANCING FOR SOME OF HIS BUSINESS IS EVEN THUHS BROTHERS COMPLETE NEAR TO WELLGIMS A COMPLETE NARRATO WELL SOME HOW THE FAMILIES BENCLEARING TENS OF MILLINGS A DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF THE PASTRUE DECATES AND NONE OF IT HAS TO DO ITH JOE DESPITE THE FACT THAT NONE OF THEM HAVE ANY REAL PUOLIFICATIONS FOR LITERALLY ANYTHING THE BOOK IS DEFINITELY WORT THE READ AGAIN THE BIDINS INSIDE THE FIRST FAMILYES FIFTY YEAR RISE TO POWER ONE THINGS ITS PRETTY MAZING ACTUALLY IS TAF U SEARCH FOR BIOGRAPHIES OF JOBIDON THEY DON'T REALLY EXIST HE SEE IS MEMORS IS THEY GOT COUPLE OF BIOGRAPHIES TERE MAY BE TWO HUNDRED PAGES OF JOBIDON BUT FOR A MAN WHO'S BEEN IN POLITICES FOR FIFTY YEARS THATE REALLY SHOULD BE MORE THERE THERE RALLY ISN'T BECAUS NO ONE WANTS TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON THE GUY WHY WE NUMBER ONE HE'S REALLY BORING BUT NMBER TWO HE'S LIKE OLD SCHOOL JUST CORRUPT HE'S T AN OLD SCHOOL NORMAL CORRUPT POLITICIAN WHO CARES MUCH MORE ABOUT HIS OWN PERSONAL BENEFIT THAN HE DOES BABOUT ANYTHING REMOTELY RESEMBLING A POLICY A GENDA OR THE COUNTRY THE FACT THAT E'S BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IT FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS IS AGAIN JUST IN HOMAGE TO THE MEDEAS OF BILITY TO WHITEWASH S BODY WHO'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY DORY FOR DECADES ON AND OUK A TIME FOR SOME QUICK THINGS THAT I HATE SOM THING THAT I HATE NUMBER ONE THE GOVERNOR OF CALFORNI GAVENUSOM HE KEEPS STOUBLING DOWN O THIS IDEA THE PARENTS I REALLY BAD AND THE TEACHERS HAR ONE WO OUGHT TO DECID WAT YOUR ISLERN WHICH IS TOTALLY CRAZY WHEN YOUR APPARENT YOU DELEGATE POWER TO TEACHERS FOR A CERTAIN UMBER OF HOURS IN A DAY IN ORDERS THAT THEY CAN TEACH THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW HOWEVER THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY CAN ACT OUTSIDE THE SCOOPE OF THE AGENCY BUT GAVENUSOM SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU GIVE YOUR KID TO A TEACHER THAT'S EACH YOUR BASICALLY HAS PLENTORY POWER OF YOUR KID FOR THE FORSEABLE FUTERE MANTY NINE PERS SUPPORTED OR OR WERE SIMPLY IGNOSTIN THAT'S PRENTIOL ET I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REFRAINED O THAT'S THAT'S AND I THINK ONE HAS A RESPONSIBILITO DROT OF WHAT SPECIFICALLY OUREFERRING TO IS IT THE NOSOON THAT IF YOU REFERENCE SOME ONE BEIN GAY THAT SOMEHOW THAT SEXUALIZING OUR KIDS IS THAT THE CASE WITH STRAIT PEOPLE IS WELL AN IF YOUR STRAIT IS THAT SEXUALIZING I DON'T I MEAN IT'S IT'S RATHER PERVERSE THAT I OFFER THAT IS A RETORICAL QUESTION BECAUSE YOU GO OF COURSE NOT SO BY DEFEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TER SIR IT'S ORWELLION DOUBLE SPEAK WHAT ITS JUST SO PROFOUNDLY IGNORANT THAT THEY BENGINDU Y OUTSIDE OGITATORS WHICH I THINK PERHAPS IS A COMBINATION TEACHING SHOWS R ABOUT THE MORALITY OF PATICULAL SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS AND BEHAVIORS IS IN FACT IN DOCTRINATION GAV THAT' THAT IS WHAT IT IS NO ONE GAVE PERMISSION FOR A TEACHER TO TEACH THEIR KIDS ABOUT THE VIRTUES OF SAME SEX MARRIAGE WHICH YES INEVITABLY IN'S GOING TO INVOLVE DISCUSSIONS OF SEX OF COURSE IT WILL THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY OCCUR IN THE CONTEXTS OF SAY STRAIGHT MARRIAGE WHY BECAUSE A CHILD CAN SEE MAMMI AND DADDY MAKE BABY DOW YOUVEN HAVE TO NOW TE MECHANISM WHAT THEY DO KNOW IS THE BABY COMES FROR MAMI AND DADDY HOWEVER WHAT IS THIT DEFERENTIATION BETWEE A SAME SEX COUPLE AND TWO GOD TO JUST LIVE TOGETHER AS ROOMMATES THE ANSWER PRESUMABLY WOULD BE SOMETHING SEXUAL WOULD IT NOT AND HOW ELSE WOULD YOU EXPLAIN SAME SEX MARIGE WHAT IS THE THING DISTINGUISHES TWO MEN WHO LIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FROM TWO MEN WHO ARE MARRIED TO ONE ANOTHER EXPLAIN WHAT IS IT WHATIS THE ACTUAL DISTINCTION IN FROMS OF LIFE STYLE THERE IS SOME DISTINCTION NIW CAN NAME YOU TH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MALE FEMALE ROOMATE AND MAY FEMALE CHILD FAMILY STRUCTURE I CAN DO WITHTHOT EVEN EXPLAINING SEX BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW FROM THE TIMETHAT THEY ARE BORN THAT THEY HAVE A MAMMI AND THAT THEY HAVE A DADDY THAT THE FACT THAT THIS TO BECOME SOMETHING THAT IS THAT IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY IS JUST DEMONSTER OF HAV STUPID EVERYTHING AS BUT IN O AGAIN YOU HAVE TO SAY THE BASIC THINGS IN THEIR CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE THE LEFT HAS BEEN SO OVERWHELMINGLY SUCCESSFUL IN QUASHING BASIC TRUTHS OF LIFE I CAN MEANWHILE ONE MORE THING THAT I HATE TO A SO THIS HAS TO BE YO THE DUMIST STORY OF THE DAY SO THERE IS THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS PERSON A MAX MILLER REPUBLICAN FROM OHIO AND HE STEPPED IN IT AFTER HE TOLD A CHRISTIAN REPUBLICAN ACTIVIST TO DELEAT A QUONQUOT BIGOTED POST HER NAME IS LIZZIE MARBA CAN SHE TREATED THERE IS

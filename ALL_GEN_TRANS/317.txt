OUR GLASS TO DAY ON OUR PROGRAM AMATEURS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY DO NOT PLAY BY THE BOOK THAT THEY HAVE YOU OR TIME ON THEIR HANDS TO TRY WHATEVER MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO A COMPLISH THINGS TO CROWSE SIMPLY NEVER WILL WE HAVE THREE STORIES ONCLETTING AMATERS STEPPING INTO ONE OF THIS POWERFUL JOBS IN THE WORLD AND WHEN I MOST COMMONPLACE STAY WITUT ACLINE THEATER OF WAR SA NIES A BIG PROFESSIONAL OUTFIT THAT IS GREAT AT ONE THING TAKES ON A TASK AT WHICH IT HAS NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL I REALLY NO SPECIAL APTITUDE FOR AN ANYWAY IT IS A RANK AMATEUR JEKIT AS THIS EXAMPLE BACK WHEN THE FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH WAS IN OFFICE SAWDOM WHO SANG INVADED COAITE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE VEITNOM REALLY AMERICA RETURNED TO THE BATTLEFIELD DERICK BROWN FELT CALLED AND SO HE WOUND UP AT FORT BRAGNORTH CAROLINA ONE OF THE LARGEST MILITARY BASIS IN THE WORLD BACK THEN ABOUT FORTY THOUS AND SOLDIERS MOST FAMOUSLY BHE EIGHTY SECOND AIR BORN ANOTHER READY UNITS H T CAN BE DEMPLOYED IN EIGHTEEN HOURS FORT BRAG IS AMERICA'S WAITING ROOM FOR WAR WHEN DERICK FIRST ARRIVED HE WAS TRAINED AS A PARA DROOPER YOU KNOW YOU'D WAKE UP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING THEN YOU WOULD DEPLOY OUT TO THE FIELD YOU DO WOULD JUMP FROM EIGHT HUNDRED FEET I WAS AN ARTILLERY MAN SO THEY THROW THE TANKS OUT OF THE PLANS THEN THEY'D THROW US OUT OF THE PLANS SO YOU DO THESE MOCK WAR EXERCISES WERE PEOPLE WOULD TRYING TO TACK YOU AND KILL YOU AND YOU'D BE OUT THE COLD AND YOU'D BE DIGGING WERE FOX HOLES AND JUST SEEING HOW POW GROUND DOWN YOU COULD POSSIBLY BE SO THAT WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR WAR YOUR BODY IN MIND HAVE BEEN PUSHED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THERE'D BE SOMETHING ELSE A VOLUNTEER DUTY I REMEMBER THE CAPTAIN OF OUR UNIT HE SAID HE HAD THE STRANGE DETAIL WHICH WAS WE HAD TO MANITORILY SEND ONE SOLDIER FROM OUR BATTERY TO BE A PART OF THIS MUSICAL AND IT WOULD LAST SEVERAL WEEKS I YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY FIELD DUTY BHUCH YOU WOULD HAVE TO SING AND DANCE AND EFRYONE THOUGHT HEAS JOKING AND I RAISED MY HAND AND HE SAID GREAT RE PORT TO THE FOR PRHEG THEATR TO DAY RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO VOLUNTEERED I WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO VOLUNTEERED AND THEY HAD ME SIT IN THIS ROOM AND THIS DIRECTOR FIRST HAD EVERYONE EDITION AND YOU ASKED ME IF I KNEW OF ANY SONGS THAT I COULD SING IN FROM ANY MUSICALS AND I SAID NOT AT ALL I NEVER SANG OR DANCED IN MY LIFE EXCEPT WHILE RUNNING AND SINGING CADENCES AND JODY CALLS IN THE MILITARY AND  HE SOI WEILL TOT SING ME SOMETHING AND I REMEMBER SINGING EVEN FLOW BY PEARL JAM CAN YOU GIV ME COUPALON HIS VENSEVEN THROU THOUGHT O EVE LIKE BUT I THINK I WAS AS A PERSON VAAND SOMEHOW THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH AND TURNS OUT THAT NO ONE WAS TURNED AWAY IN REHEARSALS DERIC QUICKLY GOT A SENSE THAT SOMETHING DIFFERENT WAS GOING ON HERE THIS WAS NOT JUST YOUR AVERAGE MUSICAL REVIEW WHAT WHAT CON A DANCING ANY DAY UT IT'S MARCH DANCING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN IT BUT IT IS OF THE DIRECTOR'S IDEA TO COMBINE THE A HONOR AND DISCIPLINE OF MILITARY MOVEMENTS WITH THE BRAVADO AND PANASH OF BROADWAY MOVEMENTS BUT THE THING DERIC REMEMBERS MOST MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS LATER WAS NOT THE SONG IN DANCE NEMBERS IT WAS THE STUFF IN BETWEEN THEYE WERE SHORT FILMS PROJECTED ON A SCREEN ABOVE THE PERFORMERS AND THEY WERE THE OPPOSITE OF LIGHT HEARTED ENTERTAINMENT GRIM TESTIMONIALS ABOUT SOLDIERS WHO DIED NOT IN COMBAT BUT DRUNK DRIVING AND ANOTHER ACCIDENTS NEAR THE BASE ALL DONE IN A DARK BLUNTNESS ONE RARELY SEES OUTSIDE DRIVER'S ED MOVIES WE GO FROM SHOW TON TO A VIDIO ON THE SCREEN OF A FELLOW SOLDIER THAT THE INTERVIEW TALKING ABOUT HOW ONE OF THEIR FELLOW SOLDIERS THEIR FRIEND DIED YOU KNOW AND THEN UT O SURPRISE WE WOULD SING SHOWTON AND IT WAS THIS PROGRESSION OF DANCE SAD VDO SING A BIT SAD VIDIO AND THEN SOME GUIES COME PELLING OUT OF THE CEILING FOR THE CLOSING NUMBER AT THE END OF THE HOUR FOR THE FINAL CHANCE TO CHEER EVER ONE UP AS O THEY LEAVE FEELING INSPIRED IT WAS

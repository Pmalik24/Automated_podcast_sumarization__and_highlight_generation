PEOPLE CATHY WAS RECRUITING ALL WHILE PEOPLE LIKE HER WERE BEING IGNORED AND SHE WAS MAD ALSO CATHY STOPPED HOLDING REGULAR PECE MEETINGS SHE SAYS BECAUSE OF COVED MERCA THINKS IT WAS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT SO SHE WOULD HAVE TO HEAR FROM THOSE WHO DISAGREED WITH HER WITHIN HER LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT PEOPLE SAY EL D HERE I THOUGHT THAT THE FRUSTRATIONS NTHAT WE SAW WOULD STOPP THE STEAL CAME FROM PEOPLE NOT KNOWING HOW TO OPERATE THEIR GOVERNMENT NOT KNOWING HOW TO PARTICIPATE BUT IF YOU'RE IF YOURE LIVING IN AN ALDE WHERE THE CHEEIR WON'T LET YOU PARTICIPATE THEN OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO NANIFESTIN

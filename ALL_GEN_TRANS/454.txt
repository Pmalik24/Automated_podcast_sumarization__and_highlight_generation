WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LABPODCANS S GUST SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO E PROOD I MAY INJUR HUBERMAN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEROBIOLOGY AN OPTHEMOLOGY AT STANFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE RECENTLY I HAD THE PLEASURE OF HOSTING TWO LIVE EVENTS ONE IN SEATA WASHINGTON IN ONE IN PORTLAND ORGAN BOTH ENTITLED THE BRAINBODY CONTRACT WHERE I DISCUSSED SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE MY FAVORITE PART OF EACH EVENING HOWEVER WAS THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD THAT FOLLOWED THE LECTURE I LOVE THE QUESTION ANSWER PERIOD BECAUSE IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY HERE DIRECTLY FROM THE AUDIENTS STO WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW MOST AND INDEED TO GET INTO A BIT OF DIALOGUE TO REALLY CLARIFY WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF PARTICULAR TOOLS HOW BEST TO USE THE TOOLS FOR THINGS LIKE FOCUS AND SLEEP WE ALSO TOUCH ON SOME THINGS RELATE TO MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IT WAS HA DELIGHT FOR ME AND I LIKE TO THINK THAT THE AUDIENCE LEARNED A LOT I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO ATTEND THOSE EVENTS BUT WE WANT TO MAKE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU THEREFORE WHAT FOLLOWS THIS IS A RECORDING OF THE QUESTION AN ANSWER PERIOD FROM THE LECTURE IN PORTLAND OREGAN I HOPE YOU'LL FIND IT TO BE BOTH INTERESTING AND IN FORMATIVE I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR SPONSORS OF THESE LIVE EVENTS THE FIRST IS MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS WHICH IS ARE PARTNER WITH THE HUBERMN LABPODCASTS PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE OF THE VERY HIGHS QUALITY THAT SHIPMUNTER NATIONAL AND THAT ARE ARRANGED IN DOSAGES AND SINGL INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DEVELOP THE OPTIMAL SUPPLEMENT STRATEGY FOR YOU AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK ARE OTHER SPONSER WHICH IS INSIDE TRACTER WHICH PROVIDES BLOODTESSANDEAN ATES SO YOU CAN MONITOR YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH PROGRESS I'D ALSO LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT THERE ARE TWO NEW LIVE EVENTS SCHADULD THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE SUNDAY OCTOBER SIXTEENTH AT THE WILL TURN THEATRE IN LOS ANGELISTS THE OTHER LIVEVENT WILL TAKE PLACE WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER NINTH AT THE BEACON THEATRE IN NEW YORK CITY TAKE ITS TO BOTH OF THOSE EVENTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE ON LINE AT HUBERMAN LABDOT CALM SLASH TOOR THAT HUBERMAN LABDOT CALM SLASH TOR I DO HOPE THAT YOU LEARN FROM AN ENJOY THE RECORDING OF THE QUESTION ANSWER PERIOD THAT FOLLOWS THIS AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN SCIENCE WHAT ARE THE CURRENT BEST PRACTICES FOR POST TEBIS TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURIES FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT I WAREN'T FAMILIAR TB I SPECIALLY LONG TERMULTIPL  ET CETERA THOUGHTS ON HYPERBARIC OEM SO GLAD YOU ACTS THIS DANDIN MORLAGE AS TREATMENT FOR T B IS O K T B I ONE THING ABOUT T B  IN CONCUSSION EVERONTHING'S FOOTBALL GUESS WHAT MOST OF THE T B I IS NOT FOOTBALL THERE AREN'T THAT MANY FOOTBALL PLAYERS THERE JUST LARGE SO THEY STAND OUT THERE MIGHT BE A F A SER THIS EVENING OF COURSE FOOTBALL PLAYERS ARE CONCERN WHEN IT COMES TO T B I MOST HEAD INJURIES ARE GOING TO BE CONSTRUCTION ORKERS IFE YOU EVER SEEN THE HARTHATS THEY WEAR THOSE ARIVANOF THEY THEY'RE JUST THERE FOR SHOW IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND THAT WE ACT LY HAVE A LABIT STAMPHORD THAT'S FOKUS VERY HARD ON TRYN TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS CARAX AND BICYCL ACCENTS PORTLAND AMAZING CITY TO CYCLE I'M FRANKLY AFRAID TO CYCLEY OR SMALL MOVING OBJECT AROUND THESE BIG OBJECTS AND PEOPLE ARE STARING TO THEIR LLE APERTURE ON THEIR PHONE WHILE DRIVING I MEAN WHATEVER HAPPEN TO THAT BY THE WAY O NOT TEXT WHILE DRIVING SOMEHOW IT THAT JUST DISAPPEARED IT'S LIKE IT REALLY HAS JUST DISAPPEARED THERE WAS ALL THE SCIENCE SHOWING THAT IT'S WORSE THAN DRUNK DRIVING T T BE I WELL THE BASIC RULES OF THE DON'TS APPLY IF YOU GET AHEAD INJURY DON'T GET A SECOND AHEAD INJURY BUT THAT OFTEN IS IN FEASIBLE FOR PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW NEED TO WORK CONTINUE WORKIN CONSTRUCTION OR THAT ARE STRUGGLING WHAT DO WE KNOW WELL THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO DISTINGUISH MODULATORY FOUNDATIONAL TOOLS FROM THINGS THAT DIRECTLY CHANGE YOUR BRAIN IN EVER SYSTEM THE WAY THAT YOU WANT TO WHAT DO I MEAN BY MODULATORY WE HEAR SO MUCH AND THEIRE SO MANY STUDIES SHOWING THAT GREAT SLEEP QUALITY NUTRITION GOOD SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AVOIDING CHRONIC STRESS AND ON AND ON AND ON ARE IMPORTANT FOR EVERYTHING REDUCE THERE RELATED TO ALSHIMERS THEYRE RELATED TO EIGHTY EGH TO I MEAN WE COULD DO THOUSANDS OF PODCAST EPISOTS JUST RETURNING TO THE SAME TEN THINGS SLEEP NOT DON'T STRUST TOO MUCH OR TOO LONG GOOD SOCIAL CONNECTION OF VOI TOXIC PEOPLE EAT GOOD FOOD NOT TOO MUCH PROCESS FOOD WE COULD HAVE AN ARGUMENT ALL NIGHT AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ONE ABOUT WEATHER NOT ITS MAINLY PLANTS OR THIS I MEAN ON THE INNER ITHIS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLEEP EATING HYH QUALITY FOOD O SOMETHING THAT WE SHALL BE DOING WHICH FOODS YOU SELECT IS A TOPIC THAT IS VERY BARBED WIRE AND I CAN GIVE ONLY MY OPINIONS ALL OF THAT MODULATES YOUR BRAIN FUNCTION BUT IT DOESN'T IMMEDIATE OR CHANGE ANYTHING DIRECTLY IT'S SETTING A FOUNDATION OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE SO WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING THOSE THINGS AND ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TBE EY NOW THIS QUESTION RELATES TO HYPERBERIC CHAMBER HYPERBERC CHAMBER THERE'S VERY INTERESTING DATIT'S ESSENTIALLY HYPEROXYGENATION OF THE BRAIN FOR VERY BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME I THINK THE DATE ON HYPERBERRIC CHAMBER AND TBEI ARE VERY ENCOURAGING THE PROBLEM IS MUCH IN THE WAY THAT A FEW YEARS AGO CRIO WAS ONLY AVAILABLE IN A FEW PLACES AND NOW PEOPLE AR DOING ICE BAS AND COL SHOWERS ON THEIR OWN IT'S HARD TOFINE TO HYPERBERIC CHAMBER THEY AREN'T JUST LAYING AROUND AND THEY DON'T HAVE THEM AT SPAS TYPICALLY AND THEY ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE SO YES THEY THERE ARE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT DATI THINK ON HYPERBERIC CHAMBER YOU DEFFLY WANT TO WORK WITH A PHYSICION OR SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY SKILLED A PRACTIC SHISNER WHO'SE VERY SKILLED IN HYPERBERIC CHAMBER THEY DO SEEM TO IMPROVE BRAING FUNCTION BY HYPEROXYGAIN THE BRAIN FOR BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME SEEM S TO IMPROVE A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT ABOVE ALL IT SEEMS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND DURATION OF SLEEP WHICH INDIRECTLY ALLOWS THE BRAIN TO REPAIR ITSELF BECAUSE AS I MENTION EARLIER BRAIN REPAIR OCCURS ER BRAIN CHANGE LARGELY OCCURS IN SLEEP SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HIPERBARE CHAMBER BUT YOU DO HAVE T B I WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER DATA WHAT ARE THOSE POINT TO WELL I GO ON AND ON AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET THIS FROM SUPPLEMENTS YOU CAN GET IT FROM FOOD BUT THIS THRESHOLD LEVEL OF ESSENTIAL THESE E P  ESSENTIAL FADY ACIS THEY ARE NOW SO MANY DATA SO MUCH DATA ON THE VALUABLE ROLL OF THESE ESSENTIAL E P A FADY ACIDS THRESHOLDS BEING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO GRAHAMS PER DAY OF THE E P A SO MUCH SO ACTUALLY THAT THERRE NOW PRESCRIPTION FORMS OF E P A THAT DOCTORS ARE STARTING TO PRESCRIBE FOR PEOPLE WITH T B E ALTHOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE YOU CAN GET THIS THROUGH YOU CAN LOOK UP AND WE'VE DONE PODCASS EPISODES ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS TO ACCESS THIS ALSO FUNCTIONS AS AN AUNTI DEPRESS AND EQUALLY GOOD BELIEVE ITARE NOT IN CLINICAL TRIALS TO ESSESS OR EYES IT ONCE ONE GETS OVER THE ONE OR BASICLY TWO GRAHAMS PER DAY OF THE E P A THE THE RESIDENT EXPERT ON THE INTERNETE ABOUT THIS IS PRETTY EXTREME ABOUT THE DOSAGES IN THAT STOCTOR RON TO PATRIC WHO BY THE WAY DESERVES A A NOD OF OF AACKNOWLEDGMENT AND SUPPORT BECAUSE TURNS OUT THAT BEFORE ME OR DAVIDS AND CLARE OR MAT WALK OR ANY THESE GUYDS WERE BLABBING TO THE WORLD ABOUT STUFF THAT THEY HAD LEARNED IN THE YOU KNOW AUR CIVES OF SCIENCE AND IN THEIR LABORATORIES THE FIRST PERSON IN WAS THIS WOMAN NAME RONTO PATRICK AS FAR AS I KNOW THE FIRST PUBLIC FACING FORMELLY TRAINED SCIENTISTS TO START GOING ON ALL THESE PODCASTS IN RISK HER REPUTATION IN THE THIS KIND OF STUFF THAT YOU DEAL WITH WHEN YOUR PUT YOUR NECKOUT THERE LIKE THAT AND ANRONDAS I THINK TERRIFIC AT WE DON'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING AND THEY WOULD BE WEIRD IF WE DID BUT I THINK SHE'S REALLY BEEN THE PROPONING OF OF THESE HIERDOSES OF E P AS FOR T B E AND FOR COGNAVE FUNCTION IN TO ALL AGES WE OFTEN HERE ABOUT WAYS TO INCREASE JOPEMIN HOWEVER ARE THERE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO DECREASE JOPEMING WHEN YOU GET TO MUCH OF IT FOR CERTAIN BEHAVIORS OR HABITS WE WANT TO BREAK KATY HAM I THINK IS THE LAST NAME THANK YOU KATY FOR YOUR QUESTION YET DOPAMINE IS I IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND DOCTOR ONOLEMKY IS THE EXPERT IN THIS AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATION SHE'S ONE OF MY CLOSER FRIENDS ON THE FACULTY UNFORTUNATELY FOR HER ARE COFFEE DISCUSSIONS OFTEN LAST FOUR HOURS OR MORE HER PORPATIONS AND FAMILY A HERE'S THE THING WHEN DOPAMINE IS HIGHER IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WHEN YOU'VE DEPLOYED IT THROUGH EXCITEMENT OR FARM AR COLLEGEY OR OTHERWISE IT TENDS TO NARROW YOUR FOCUS AND MAKE YOU SEEK MORE OF IT IN THAT GENERAL THEME THAT YOU HAPPEN T BE FOCUSSED ON COULD BE ANYTHING THAT'S THE SCARY THING ABOUT DOPOMINE WHAT CAN YOU DO TO CONTROL IT AND TO RE DUSE IT WELL FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE ENGAGING IN HABITS THAT ARE HEALTHY MAYBE THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE REDUCING DOAMINE HOW DO YOU DEFINE HEALTHY VERSES UNHEALTHY WELL I THINK THE SIMPLEST WAY TO DEFINE ADDICTION AT LEAST BY MY MIND IS THAT A DICTION IS A PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE THINGS THATBRING YOU PLEASURE AND A GOOD LIFE IS A PROGRESSIVE EXPANSION OF THE THINGS THAT BRING YOU PLEASURE IRATHER SIMPLE DEFINITION AND YET WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF DOPAMINE I DOUBT DOPAMINE IS NOT UNIQUE TO ONE PURSUIT IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO PURSUE THE PURSUIT OF SEX OF THE PURSUIT OF WARMTH WHEN YOU'RE COLD OR OR COOL ENVIRONMENTS WHEN YOU'RE TO WARM OR FOOD OR SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S JUST A DOMMOLECULE THAT PUTS YOU INTO THIS FORWARD STATE OF MASS SMALL VISUAL APERTURE AND A KIND OF OBSESSIVE LIKE NATURE WHAT CAN YOU DO TO COUNTER THAT WELL THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO NOT GET INTO THAT STATE TOO LONG BUT IF YOU DO THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IT'S TO TRY AND SWITCH OFF THAT SYSTEM NOT THROUGH PHARMACOLOGY BUT BY NOT PURSUING MORE DOPAMINE THE DAY AFTER A BIG EVENT THE SO CALLED POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION NAMED OF COURSE BECAUSE OF TRUE POSTPARTUM AFTER THE DELIVERY OF A CHILD THAT SQUITE COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO GET VERY VERY DEPRESSED THERE IS A LOT OF NO CHEMICAL AND HORMONAL ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE OCCURRING BUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION OCCUR AFTER A BIG PARTY THE MONDAY BLUES THE SUNDAY BLUES THE POST WHATEVER BLUES THE FOUR MONTH MARK IND A RELATIONSHIP IT'S TYPICALLY WHEN DOPAMENE STARTS TO DRAWP I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE JUST WAIT I'M TELLING SOMEBODY VERY CLOSE TO ME RIGHT NOW JUST WAIT FOUR MONTHS FOUR MONTHS FOUR MONTHS AND ALSO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH THAT PERSON AS POSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS DEAL IS ABOUT NOT SPENDING AS MUCH TIME WITH PEOPLE I THINK PEOPLE ARE AFRAID THAT THE DOPAMINE WAVEPOOL IS JUST CAN O PULL THEM BOTH UNDER I THINK THEYVE CALLED AT THE ESCALATOR MODEL OF RELATIONSHIP WERE YOU O SORT OF FIND YOURSELF IN THE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE YOU WENT THROUGH THE STAGES WITHOUT ACTUALLY DECIDING ON THEM IN ANY EVENT FOUR MONTHS SEEMS TO BE THE STAGE IN WHICH THE DOPAMINE CRECENDO STARTS TO RELAC A LITTLE BIT NOT IN A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP HOWEVER WE KNOW THIS RIGHT ANTICIPATION IS DOPAMINE THAT POSITIVE ANTICIPATION AND THERE'S A WHOLE BEAUTIFUL SCIENCE OF THIS IN THE AND I SHOULD SAY PSYCHOLOGY OF THIS THERE'S A WONDERFUL BOOK ACTUALLY THE NAME OF THE BOOK IS EMBARRASSING ALWAYS I DON'T KNOWI FOR ME TO SAY IT'S AT IT'S BY PSYCHALLE IS CALLED CIN LOVE LAST WHICH IS AT A PSYCHOANALYTIC BOOK ABOUT THIS DOPAMINE CERATONAN SYSTEM AND THE KIND OF SEE SAWING BACK AND FORTH AND THE FACT THAT IN RELATIONSHIPS PEOPLE OFTEN JUST SLAM ON THE DOPAMINE SIDE OF THINGS AND THEN THEY HIT A WALL AND WANT TO BREAK UP WHERE THEY GO INTO THIS LIKE WARM COSY FUZZY FEELING THING AND THEY GO WHELL I GUESS THE EXCITING PART IS OVER AND THIS IDEA THAT ONE COULD ACTUALLY OR TOO PEOPLE OR HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE WERE IN PORTLAND COULD OCILLATE THIS SEE SAW I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WANT TO USE FARM A CHOLOGY TO TURN OFF THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM BUT FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE A HARD TIME SLEEPING AND THAT ARE REALLY IN A STATE OF AGITATION AND CONSTANTLY OBSESSING THE PSYCHIATRISTS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS IS THAT THE PSYCHIATRISTS AND THIS DOES HAVE TO BE PRESCRIBED WILL USE A VERY VERY LOW DOSE OF A DOPAMIN RECEPTOR BLOCKER LIKE HALIPARADOL WHICH IS A USE TO TREAT SKHIS OFRENDY A VERY LOW DOSE TO SHUT DOWN THE OBSESSION COMPONENT SMART WELL EDUCATED PSYCHATRIS KNOW THIS AS A USEFUL TO BUT THIS IS AT ONE TIME THING WITH A VERY LOW DOSE BECAUSE HAVING YOUR DOPAMINE BLOCK SOCKS IT DOES NOT FEEL GOOD BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP AND BEING AN OBSESSIVE MODE ALSO SOCKS SO IT'S ISHLY A VERY POTENT CLINICAL TOOL SO FORM ACOLOGY SHOULD IS ONE TOOL BUT REALLY AT THE FAR END OF THINGS I BELIEVE THAT ONE SHOULD TRY AND MODULATE THEIR OWN DOPAMINE BY NOT REWARDING ONE SELF ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT ONLY RANDOMLY RANDOM INTERMITTENT REWARD IS TRULY THE BEST SCHADULE OF REWARD HENCE SLOT MACHINES AND SO ON AND YOU SHOULD ENGAGE RANDOM INTERMENT IN REWARD AND I THINK THIS IS ALSO THE WAY THAT WE SHOULD TRAIN KIDS A SENT I CALL TRAINING KIDS YOU CAN SELL ADO KIS THEU YOU DON'T REWARD THEM EVERY TIME I DON'T BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD GET A TROPHY EVERY TIME NOR SHOULD YOU ALWAYS JUST REWARD THE WINNERS BECAUSE THOSE WINNERS OFF AND WE SEE CASES OF THIS HYGH PROFILE CASES OF THIS THEY OFTEN CRASH AND BURN AMIN THE NUMBER OF HYH PERFORMERS THAT CRASH AND BURN PUBLICLY AND LOR KNOWS HOW MANY DO IT PRIVATELY IS REMARKABLAT'S CAUSE TEIR DOPAMINE SYSTEM IS ALL MESSED UP SO RANDOM INTERMITTEN REWARD IS THE SCHEDULE REWARD THAT WE SHOULD IMPART ON OURSELVES IF YU HAD TEN MINUTES A DAY TO IMPROVE YOUR BRAIN PLACISY WHAT WOULD YOU DO AND WHEN WOULD YOU DO IT RICHARD CONLAN THANK YOU WELL I'M GOING TO SAY AGAIN I WOULD ABSOLUTELY ANCHOR MY PHYSIOLOGY WITH MORNING SUNLIGHT VIEWING I CAN'T HELP IT YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING I'LL TELL YOU VERY BRIEFLY YOU KNO ATS SPECIAL ABOUT MORNING SUNLIGHT THIS LOW ANG SOLAR ANGLE SUNLIGHT I HAVE I ONLY HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS MUCH ON SOCIAL MEDEA OR ON THE PODCAST THERE'S A GROUP AT THE UNIVERSYO WASHINGTON A COUPLE JA AND MORINE NIGHTS THEY RUN A LAP TOGETHER THAT SOUNDS LIKE A HORRIBLE THING BUT THEY DO IT AND THEY GET ALONG VERY WELL AND THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE SELLS IN YOUR EYE THE NURONS THAT SET YOUR CIRCATEAN CLOCK MAKE YOU ALERT DURING THE DAY AND MAKE YOU SLEEPY AT NIGHT AND SO ON THOSE SELLS RESPOND BEST TO YELLOW BLUE CONTRAST AND ORANGE TONES NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUS'S WHEN YOU GO OUT IN THE MORNING EVEN IF IT'S NOT AT SUNRISE BUT IT'S CLOSE TO SUNRISE OR YOU LOOK AT THE SUN IN THE EVENING WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS YELLOW BLUE CONTRAST OR ORANGE YELLOW BLUE ORANGE AT OLD THING FROM KINDERGARDENOR FIRST GRADE THAT'S NOT THE COLOR OF LIGHT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHEN THE SUN IS OVERHEAD NOW THIS ALSO IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS AT LEAST TO MIME UNDERSTANDING EVEN THE DAYLIGHT SIMULATORS HAVE NOT PICKED UP ON THIS THERE'S JUST ABOUT BRIGHT LIGHT SOME ONE OUGHT TO DESIGN SOMETHING THAT CAN MIMIC THIS BUT NATURE HAS DONE THIS BEAUTIFULLY FOR UST AND SO VIEWING LOW SOLAR ANGLE SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EVENING IS MOST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF THOSE YELLOW BLUE CONTRASTS NOW HERE'S THE REALLY WILD THING THOSE CIRCUITS THAT SET YOUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS AND SLEEP YEST THEY RESPOND BEST TO YELLOW BLUE CONTRAST BUT WHAT THAT TELLS US IS CRAZY WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT COLOR VISION WAS PROBABLY NOT RELATED TO COLOR PERCEPTION FIRST BECAUSE ALL OF THAT IS COMPLETELY SUBCONSCIOUS THE PATHWAYS THAT DO THIS OUR PRESENT IN PEOPLE WHO ARE PATTERN VISION BLIND 'S WHA DO I MEAN I MEAN THAT COLOR VISION LIKELY EVOLVED FROM A NEED TO SYNCRONIZE YOUR INTERNAL STATE WITH THE EXTERNAL WORLD AND THE BEST STIMULUS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD TO DO THAT IS YELLOW BLUE CONTRAST IN OTHER WORDS OUR ABILITY TO DETECT COLOR WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST AND WE UNDERSTAND THIS SPASED ON EVOLUTIONARY GENOMICS AND SO FORTH TO EXTRACT TIME OF DAY INFORMATION NOT COLOR OF FRUIDS OR COLOR OF SKIN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT'S ALL SECONDARY WHICH IS WILD AND CRAZY AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WAY WE THINK THINGS WORK IS NOT THE WAY THEY WORK IT'S COMPLETELY A HUNDREDEY DEGREES OPPOSITE I'M JUST CAN EVEALLA TEESER I HAD A GUEST ON THE PODCASTI ASN'T WE HAVE AN AIRD THE EPISODE YET HIS NAME IS ERIC JARVIS HE WORKS ON SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ELSO HAS ADMITTED THE ALVENILY DANCE COMPANY AGAIN WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE IS A PROFESSOR OF THE ROCKIFELLOR ANYWAY I LEARNED FROM ERIC AND YOU'LL LEARN WHEN THAT EPISODE COMES OUT THAT YOU ONLY FIND A LABORATE SPEECH AND LANGUAGE IN SPECIES THAT ALSO ENGAGE IN DANCE AND SONG AND THAT YOU NOMEX POINT TO THE FACT THAT SONG AND SINGING CAME FIRST AND LANGUAGE CAME SECOND AND THAT LED ME DURING THAT EPISODE OF THE PODCAST I WROTE DOWN IN MY NOTES I WAS LISTENING TO HIM TALK AND I WROTE DOWN IN MY NOTE BOOK IS JUST SCRAWLED IND BIG LETTERS IS AS I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW I WAS JUST BLOWN AWAY I COULD AN IT MAKE SO MUCH SENSE WHEN YOU HEAR IT THAT THIS COLORS IN THE SKY WERE WHAT WE OUR SYSTEM IS TRYING TO EXTRACT NOT A PERCEPTION OF THOSE COLORS IN THE SKY CAUSE THERE INFORMING US ABOUT TIME AND ORIENTING US IN TIME THAT SONG AND THE COMMUNICATION OF EMOTIONAL STATES WOULD BE SIMPLER AND MORE FOUNDATIONAL THAN COMMUNICATION ABOUT SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF LANGUAGE WHEN YOU HEAR IT SUDDENLY IT MAKE SENSE BUT OF COURSE WERE HUMAN BEINGS AND UNLESS YOUR ERIC JARVIS OR ALICHROMER ON OLEMPKY YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE STUFF BACKWARDS AS I DO HOW CAN I NAVICATE MY WAY THROUGH TAKING SUPPLEMENTS TO OPTIMIZE MY HEALTH WHEN MY CREER DEMANDS AR INFANTRY PREVENT ME FROM BEING ABLE TO STABLISH CONSISTENT RUCINES ANDRIAGAN WILL THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DO ANDREW SO THE CONSISTENT ROUTINE THING IS TOUGH YOU KNOW HERE THE HERE'S WHAT I CAN SAY WITHOUT GOING INTO A LONG TO AND HALF HOUR EPISO N ABOUT JETLAGON SHIFT WORK WHICH WE'VE DONE THE MOST POWERFUL WAY TO ANCHOR YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND TIME IS INDEED VIEWING LIGHT SUNLIGHT AT CONSISTENT TIMES OF DAY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I MADE UP WE WE KNOW THIS BASED ON A LOT OF WORK THET DATES BACK TO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE SECOND MOST POWERFUL STIMULUS IS GOING TO BE MOVEMENT AND CHANGES IN BODY TEMPERATURE IN PRERTULAR INCREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE TEN TO MAKE US ALERT AND DECREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE AND TO MAKE US SLEEPY BODY TEMPERATURE DROPS ONE OR THREE DEGREES TO GET US INTO SLEEP WHY DOES A COALD SHOWER WAKE YOU UP A DRENALINE AS RELEASED IN BELIEVER NOT YOUR BODYES HEATING UP INTERNALLY TO COMBAT THAT COLD UNLESS YOU MAKE YOURSELF HYPITHERMIC SO SONA HOT BATHS TO GET SLEEPY COL SHOWERS ICE BAS ET CETERA TO WAKE UP SORT OF OBVIOUS WHEN YOU HEAR IT BUT IT'S COUNTER INTUITIVE BECAUSE YOU THINK O HEATING UP THE BODY TO WAKE UP AND COOLING DOWN THE BODY TO GO TO SLEEP SO GETTING INTO COLLD OT O COOL ME DOWN BUT YOUR BODY COMPENSATES JUST LIKE IF YOU THROW A COLD TOWEL ON A THERMISTAT YOU CRANK UP THE TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM AN VICE FORSU FOR HEAT OK SO WHAT YOU DO YOU WANT TO TRY AND USE AS MANY OF THESE THINGS LIGHT TEMPERATURE EXERCISE FOOD WHEN YOU EAT IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH WAKING VERY FEW OF US ARE CAPABLE OF EATING IN OUR SLEEP AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS SOCIAL ACTIVITY AND RHYTHMS NOW THAT THE DISCOMBOBULATED PERSON AS CAN BE THE PERSON THAT HAS NOT A LINED THESE THINGS IND A CONSISTENT WAY SO WHILE SCHEDULES VARY AND ANDRIT DON'T KNOW YOUR EXACT SCHEDULE WHAT I CAN SAY IS IF YOU SUDDENLY GO FROM DAYTIME BEHAVIOUR IN SLEEPING AT NIGHT TO THE SO CALLED VAMPIRE SHIFT AS IT'S CALLED IN THE MILITARY AND SUDDENLY YOUR UP INTHE MIDDLE THE NIGHT IN YOUR SLEPING DURING THE DAY THAN WHEN YOU COME OFF THAT SHIFT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TRYIANG COMBINE AS MANY OF THOSE SAME THINGS AT ONE TIME SO IT WOULD BEGET YOUR SUNLIGHT SO GO JOGING WITHOUT YOUR SUNGLASSES DRINK YOUR COFFEE ENGAGE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND COMMUNICATE EAT A MEAL AFTERWARDS OR S THE CASE MAY BE BEFORE TRY AND BRING AS MANY OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER THE SAME TIME OF DAY FOR A FEU DAYS AND PRETTY SOON YOR SYSTEMWIL MAP AROUND THAT SO THE REASON I ENCOURAGE FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE NOT DOING SHIFT WORK TO TRY AND BE FAIRLY CONSISTENT ABOUT SUNLIGHT VIEWING IS IT SETS IN MOTION EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S CORRECT BUT IF IN TERMS OF TIMING OF EATING APPETITE WILL FOLLOW WHEN YOUR ALERT WILL FOLLOW YOU'LL STRUCK TO LEARN YOUR OWN RHYTHMS WHEN YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR SCHEDUL TRY AND COMBINE AS MANY OF THOSE CUES AGAIN LIGHT TEMPERATURE EXERCISE FOOD SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INTO ONE PERIOD OF TIME AND TRYING LOCK THAT INTO A MORE OR LESS A ONE OR TWO HOUR PERIOD OR PLUSSER INEUS ONE OR TWO HOURS AT A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY FOR AT LEAST TWO OR THREE DAYS AND YOUR SCHEDUAL BEANING YOUR INTERNAL CLOCKS WILL LOCK TO THAT HOW A SOCIAL MEDIA CHANGING OUR BRAINS THOMAS AT WELL YOU KNOW YOU HEAR YOU HEAR ALL THE TERRIBLE WAYS IN WHICH ITS CHANGING OUR BRAINS AND I THINK THAT AGAIN I WE GO BACK TO THE THING IS IS IT THE APERTURE THAT WERE LOOKING AT SO AS IT THE FORMAT THAT WERE ENGAGING IN THINGS OR IS IT THE CONTENT WELL THE WAY I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THE PHONE IS THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE PHONE AND THE LAP TOP FOR THAT MATTER IN STARING INTO THE SMALL VISUAL APERTURE EACH DAY IS SORT OF LIKE WALKING LIKE THIS ALL DAY LONG RIGHT WE HAVE THIS AMAZING ABILITY TO SHUFFLE OUR FEET AND TAKE SMALL STEPS OR TO TAKE BIG STRIDES TO RUN TO MOVE THINK THAT'S THE SAGUTAL PLAIN FOR MOVEMENT I KNOW IT FOR THE BRAINBUT ALWAYS MES THE PTS ORE VICIOUS PEOPLE ON LINE BY THE WAY THE PTS AND NEUTURCIAN PEOPLE I'VE LEARNED TO JUST NOT NOT SAY ANYTHING ABUT THAT I'M NOT A P T AND I'M NOT PHYSICAL THERAVIS AND THET THEY DO INCREDIBLE WORK BUT THEI'R IT'S A VERY SPIRITED CROWD AND THE NEUTURCIAN THING IS REALLY WEIRD HOW THERE I MS JUST INCREDIBLE YOU'REYOU THAT PEOPLE ARE EITHER THROWING LIVER AT YOU OR THEI'RE THROWING CELERY AT YOU OR THERE IS THEIR FASTING OR THE'RE NOT FASTING IT'S NOT IN ANY CASE THE SOCIAL MEDIA AND STARING AT A SMALL VISUAL APERTURE IS CHANGING OUR BRAINS HERE'S ONE WAY I KNOW IN WHICH IT'S CHANGING OUR BRAINS AND THEN I'LL ELLYOU HOW TO FIX IT IF YOU STARE OR LOOK AT SOMETHING TO WITHIN TWO FEET OF YOU FOR A CERTAIN UMBER OF HOURS EACH DAY YOUR EYEBALL ACTUALLY GETS LONGER AND THE VISUAL IMAGE THEN IS FOCAS IN FRONT OF YOUR NERAL RETINA NOT ON TO YOUR NERL RETINA AND YOU ARE BECOMING MYOPIC NEAR SIGHTED AND IF YOU LOOK AT THINGS IN THE DISTANCE ENOUGH GUESS WHAT YOUR EYEBALL CHANGES SHAPE AND YOUR LENS WILL FOCUS APPROPRIATELY THE IMAGE ON TO YOUR RETINA TAKE SOME WORK KIDS THIT LOOK AT THINGS UP CLOSE TOO MUCH AND ADULTS TO LOOK AT THINGS UP CLOSE MUCH BECOME NEAR SIGHTED AND THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL SET OF CLINICAL TRIALS NOW WHERE MAINLY IN KIDS IF KIDS GET OUTSIDE FOR TWO HOURS A DAY GETTING A LOT OF THIS U V B AND BLUE LIGHT THAT WE'RE TOLD US SO TERRIBLE FOR US BUT THEY GET IT FROM SUNLIGHT THEY ACTUALLY CAN REVERSE MY OPIA REDUCED THE INCIDENTS OF MY OPIA MAYBE EVEN GLAUCOMA ALTHOUGH THAT'S A BIG MABY SO HOW MUCH STARING INTO A SMALL VISUAL APERTURE IS TOO MUCH I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT WE ARE LITERALLY BECOMING MYOPIC IN TERMS OF OUR VISION AND WE'RE BECOMING MYOPIC AND TERMS OF OUR COGNITION AND THEN THERE'S THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY CONTAINED IN THOSE TWEETS AND THOSE SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS AND THOSE NEW STORIES WHICH FRANKLY I FEEL LIKE YOU LOSE EITHER WAY WHETHER OR NOT YOU'R ONE POLITICAL CAMP OR ANOTHER POLITICAL CAMP YOUR UPSET ABOUT HALF OF THE INFORMATION OUT THERE SO I FEEL I UT YOU KNOW I AND I'M NOT A NOT SOME ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS WITHOUT STUMBLING I DIDN'T DO WELL IN SOCIAL STUDIES I'M N THIS SORT OF THING IT JUST NEVER MAKE SENSE TO ME JUST FELT LIKE THE THE THE PRIZE GOES TO THE PERSON WHO CAN SHOUT THE LOUDEST AND THE MOST COHERENTLY FOR A MOMENT SO BUT I ENCOURAGE OF COURSE PEOPLE TO BE POLITICALLY ACTIVE AND I VOTE BUT BUT THE THE CONTENT IS TRICKY TO NAVIGATE AND I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT EXCEPT THAT IT SEEMS TO BE BOTHERING EVERYBODY ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER OR IN THE MIDDLE AND THE FORMAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY UNDERSTAND AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW OF MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS NARROW VISUAL WINDOW FORMAT THING IT CAME UP MORDURING THE LOCK DOWNS WHEN WE WERE ALL INSIDE A LOT AND NOT LOOKING OUT AT A DISTANCE THE THE DATA SAY REALLY TO TRY AND GET AT LEAST TEN MINUTES OF LONG DISTANCE VIEWING SO LONGER THAN TEN FEET AWAY FROM US FOR EVERY THIRTY MINUTES OF CLOSE UP VIEWING AND NOT A LOT OF US ORE DOING THAT IF YOU'RE WALKING TO YOUR CAR LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE YOARE DEFINITELY LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY WHAT NEW PIECE OF NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH ARE YOU MOST EXCITE ABOUT MYTALMEN O UM  I THINK THE THE PIECE OF NEUROLOGIC RESEARCH THAT I THE WEIRD STUFF I'V GOT THIS AM COLLYU ET STAMFORD TONY WISE'S CORRY IND THE REALLY INTO TAKING LITERALLY TAKING PROTEENS FROM YOUNG BLOOD AND YOUNG SPINAL CORD A SREBRAL SPINAL FLUID AND PUTTING IT IN TO OLDER PEOPLE AN ANIMALS AND THEY GET YOUNGER THAT'S TUT PRETTY WILD UM THE FEAGAL TRANSPLANT STUFF IS PRETTY WILD RIGHT YOU TAKE THE MICROBION FROM ONE PERSON AND AS IT SOUNDS YOU TRANSPLANT IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND THEY TAKE ON THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DOWNER CREAZY UNTIL I TALK TO MY CEN THERE SOME SHOUTS FOR FEAGAL TRANSPLANT IS I HAVE NEVER READ THE METHOD SECTIONS OF THOSE PAPERS I'M ACTUALLY AFRAID TO READ THE METHOD SECTIONS I YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THIS IS NOT A NEUROLOGICAL BUT AT THE WORK FROM CRIS GARDENER AND JUSTIN SONINBURG ALSO AT STAMFORD IT MAKE SUS OT LIKE I JUST LIKE STAMFOR STAMBRSERE BUT THSE ARE THE PEOPLE I'M CLOSEST TO INTROWN ABY THEIRE EXCELLENT PLACES EVERYWHERE OF COURSE UM INCLUDING O I JUST SEE WHAN I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT COS I'M HERE ACTUA CLOSE COLLEAGUES HERE AND FRIENDS HERE AT I WACH JUST YOU ALSO AMAZING ALTHOUGH THAT TRAM THING FREAKS ME OUT IT I I ALWAYS JUST  HAVE ALTHEYS IDEAS ABOUT WHA'S CAN HAPPEN IF THAT THING BREAKS BUT THE THE THE MICROBIOM DATE ARE REALLY INTERESTING I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY GETTING YOU'R GOT MICROBION WAS IMPORTANT AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE GOT ACTUALLY MAKES MANY OF THE NARROW TRANSMITTER PRECURSERS THAT YOUR BRAIN USES SO THAT'S PRETTY COOL AND I WAS THOUGHT IT OULD BE A COMPLICATED THING TO GET YOU GOT MICROBIOM RIGHT BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S FERMENTED FOODS THAT SEEM O HAVE THE BIGGEST EF FACT THERE IS ALL THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT FIBR IN YES FIBRS IMPORTANT AND HERE I AM GETTING NERVOUS TALKINGABOUT NUTRICION CAUSE THE PEOPLE CAN LIKE COME AT ME WITH FIBER BUT THE UM BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM JUSTIN AND CHRSAS DATA THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING FOUR SERVINGS TO DAY OF THESE OF FERMENTED FOODS WHETHER NOT ITS KIMSHY OR SOUR CROW OR COMBUCHALL IT THAT SUFF ACTUALLY SEEMS TO ENCOURAGE A HEALTH THE GOT MICROBIOM AND PEOPLE FEEL BETTER IN THER MEN SYSTEM WORKS BETTER AND I LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY A IT RESOLVES IN ISSUE WHICH IS THAT HIDOSE PROBIOTICS THESE VERY EXPENSIVE I NEED TO BE REFRIGERATED THINGS THOSE ACTUALLY CAN CREATE BRAIN FOG AND OTHER ISSUES THERE FOR REAL SEVERE CASES OF DISPIOSIS SO ALWAYS LIKE AN INSTANCE WHERE ONE CAN LOOK TO FOODS UM WHICH ARE GOOD CAUSE I LIKE TO EAT UM IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES UM IN TERMS OF OTHER A NEUROLOGIC ISSUES I THINK THAT FRANKLY I CHINK THE STUFF ON DOPAMEN IS IS IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT SO MUCH ADDICTION THAT'S A SEVERE CASE BUT ALSO SO MUCH WAXING AND WANING OF OF MOTIVATION AND ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE DOPO MEN SYSTEM YOU SAY WHAT ACTIVITIES O MY ENGAGING IN OR FARMACOLLOGY MY ENGAGING IN WHAT AM I DOING TO SPITE DOPAMEN YOU START OH I GET IT THE WAVES IN THIS WAVEPOOL ARE TOO HIGH AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T DO THIS CONSISTENTLY AND THEN YOU DO TH THE COUNTER INTUITIVE THING OF APPROACHING THINGS WITH A LITTLE LESS EXCITEMEN BUT THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THEM MORE CONSISTENTLY AH AND MAYBE WITH SOME LUCK ALL AND FINISHING THIS BOOK THATVING WORKING ON FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS ASE THE CONSEQUENCE CAUSE I CAN'T SEEM TO THINKING ABOUT THE WHIMHOFF METHOD DO YOU BELIEVE IT HOW I'S IT REALLY WORKING WHAT PROCESS IS HAPPENING IN HIS BRAIN O BOY AM MADISON CAMERN EVERYONE HERE PROLLY FAMILIAR WITH WIMHOFF UM WHOSE A OCCUPATION ON WICCAPEDIA USED TO BE DARE DEVIL DAISCOOL SA EVIL CAN EVIL ADA AND WHIM HAT I A STORY ABOUT WHIM ACTUALLY EN TWENTY SIXTEEN I HEARD ABOUT THE SKY WHIM HOF AND UM I GOT A HOLD OF HIM ACTUAL HIS A CHILDREN UM AND I HAD ONE VACATION THAT YEAR AND I FLEW TO SPAIN AND I SPENT SOME TIME MOUNTAINEERING WITH WHIM WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING I ALMOST LOST A LEG LEGITIMATELY I TIED IN WRONG ON A BRIDGE SLING HE TOLD ME IT WAS GOOD FOR ME HE TOLD ME TO STARE INTO THE LIZERS ES AND I ARRED INTO THE LIZZARS EYES THAT JUMPED BACKWARDS OFF THIS HOME MADE BRIDGE SLING THING AND I HAD THE ROPE WRAPPED THROUGH MY LEG IN IT I CAME BACK WITH BASICALLY THE TENDINT ON THE BACK OF MY KNEE EXPOSED AND SITTING NEXT TO ME ON THE PLAIN WAS OUR VICE DEAN OF RESEARCH AT STAMFORD AND I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHAT I WAS DOING AND WHY IT WAS VERY EMBARRASSING WHAT DID WE DO ON THAT TRIP WHILE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WILL HEP ME ANSWER YOURE QUESTION FIRST OF ALL WHEN I ARRIVED I SUFFER TERRIBLY FROM JET LAG BUT THE MOMENT I GOT THEIR WHIM DID NOT SAY HELLO HE LITERALLY TOLD ME TO GET INTO THE ICE BATH AND I DID TEN MINUTES IN THE ICE BATH NOT BECAUSE I'M TOFF BUT BECAUSE HE HELD ME DOWN IN THE ICE BATH HE IS INDEED ONE OF THE STRONGEST HUMAN BEINGS YOU REMINDS ME OF THE BUS DRIVER ON THE SIMPSONS OR THE JANITOR EXCUSE ME NO A AUTO IS THE BUS DRIVER RIGHT THAT THE JANITOR ON THE SIMPSONS A UTE I THAT'S WHIM INCREDIBLY PHYSICALLY STRONGGUY WHAT DO I THINKS GOING ON WITH WHIMHOF A STUFF WELL WHIM OFF WHETHER NOT HE UNDERSTANDS IT OR NOT  I WAS THINK HE SORT OF THE BOBD ILLIN OF BREATH WORK LIKE EVERYTHING HE SAYS SEEMS TO HAVE SOME INTUITIVE SINCE WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IN THE WORLD HE SAYING ESCIN A COME AFTER ME NOW WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD A GOOD BUT COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP II'LL JUST CONFESS MAY WE SOME THEY WILL RESOLVE THAT A NO BIG SCANDALOR STORY THERE JUST WE COMMUNICATE VERY DIFFERENTLY AM WHIM HAS A COUPLE METHODS ONE IS TO DELIBERATELY HYPER VENTILAT THERE'S ALSO ALL TUMO BREATHING MY LAB ACTUALLY STUDIES THIS WE HAVE A PAPER THT 'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU THE RESULT SO THOUGH THEY'RE NOT PUBLISH YET WHERE PEOPLE DO DELIBERATE SICKLIC HY PREVENTILATION WHICH AS THE NAME SUGGEST YOU JUST BREATHE REALLY DEEPLY IN AND REALLY DEEPLY OUT TWENTY FIVE TIMES OR IF YOUR WHIM YOU SAY YOU NNO N'T ENOI JUST TELP YOU HERE'S HOUT WORKS YOU GO YOU' GAT TWENTY FIVE TIMES AND YOU HEAT UP AND YOU FEEL REALLY AGITATED AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF A DRENNALIN IF YOU THROW YOURSELF INTO AN ICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER A DRENNALIN IF SOMEBODY UPSETS YOU ORE OU GET A TRIGGERING TEXT A DRENNALIN A DRENNALIN SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE THING EXCEPT WHEN YOU DELIBERATELY INDUCE IT AS MY COLLIC DAVID SPEAGLE SAYS THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOING INTO A STATE AND YOU CONTROLLING YOU'RE ENTRY INTO A STATE SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE STATE YOU'RE IN IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU GOT THERE AND WHETHER NOT YOU HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT STATES OF HIGHA DRENNALIND OUR VERY POWERFUL WHEN YOU SELF INDUCE A DRENNLIN BY COLD SHOWER SICKLY CYPERVENTILATION A C A WHIMHOFF BREATHING OR TUMO BREATHING YOU THEN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A VERY DISTINCT MIND BODY RELATIONSHIP WE ALL HERE THAT IN TERRORSEPTION AND THE MIND BODY RELATIONSHIP AN TORRECEPTION JUST YOUR ABILITY TO SENDS YOUR HEART BEATS AND WHAT'S GOING ON YOUR BODY POWERFUL RIGHT TERRIBLE IF HOW YOU FEEL SOCKS SO AN TERRICEPTION IS WONDERFUL BUT WHEN YOU'RE ANXIOUS IT ACTUALLY IS IT MORE ADAPTID TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR THINKING AND GET YOURSELF OUT OF THAT ANXIOUS STATE SO IF YOU'RE TREMBLING IN YOUR BODY'S FREAKING OUT AND YOUR CHEEKS ARE FLUSHING AND YOUR AND YOUR BRAIN IS FOLLOWING YOUR BODILY STATE WELL THAT'S NOT GOOD AND IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY AND SADLY THIS HAPPENS A LOT WHERE YOU'VE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF TROM OR TYPICALLY THIS A PEOPLE THAVE BEEN BARDED WITH EXTREME CRITICISM OR PHYSICAL ABUSE OR OTHER KINDS OF ABUSE TURING DEVELOPMENT THE ACTION CAN SEEM VERY CALM BUT INTERNALLY THEY'R FREAKING OUT IN THEIR HEAD IN THEY'RE JUST THINK YOU JUST GET ME THROUGH THIS AND THEY JUST GO INTO A STATE WHERE NO ONE KNOWS THEIR UPSET I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE LIKE THIS AND IT'S ERIE TO ME BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HAD THAT RESPONSE TO STRESS BUT IT'S VERY COMMON AND SO WE SHOULD LEARN AND BE CAREFUL ABOUT DECIDING THAT PEOPLE ARE IN ONE STATE OR ANOTHER BASED ON THEIR BODILY OR THEIR MENTAL RESPONSE WHIM HOFF BREATHING COLD SHOWERS ET CETERA OR A GREAT PRACTICE IN MY OPINION BECAUSE THEY ALLOW YOU TO SPIKE CURE A DRENALINE AND YOU CAN DO THAT FOR INSTANCE BY MAKING THE WATER COLDER IF YOU WANT MORE A DRENALINE STAYING IN LONGER IF YOU WANT MORE A DRENALINE MOVING YOUR LIMBS AROUND IN THE WATER WILL GIVE YOU MORE OR DRENALINE CAUSE IT BREAKS UP THAT THURMA LAYER IT MAKES IT A LOT COLDER OR DOING FIFTY DEEP IN HALS AND EXALS THAT IS VERY USEFUL BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TY USE THAT PREFRONTOL QUARTAX AND TO STOP AND SENSE ALL THAT A DRENALINE IN YOUR BODY AND YET MAINTAIN CLARITY OF MIND AND THAT'S AND ABSOLUTELY POWERFUL TOOL I WOULD EVEN CALLT A POWER TOOL AND WHIM FIGURE THIS OUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT THE WAY THAT WHIM DISCOVERED ALL THIS WAS HE WAS IN DEEP GRIEF ABOUT THE TRAGIC DEATH OF HIS WIFE SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE JUMPED OFF AND ATE STORY BUILDING IT JUST TRULY TRAGIC THAT AND HE WAS AND SITUATION YET FOUR CHILDREN AT THE TIME NOW HE AS FIVE AND HE WAS IN A STATE OF DEPRESSION AND HE ENDED UP GOING INTO THE CANAL IN AMSTERDAM AND IT WAS VERY COLD AND T SHOCKED HIS SYSTEM AND IN THAT SHOCK TO SYSTEM WHICH IS CAUSED BY A DRENALINE HE SOMEHOW WAS ABLE TO ANCHOR HIS THINKING AND IN A KIND OF GENIUS OF SORTS WHIM WELL I CAN INTERVENE IN MY PHYSIOLOGY WITH THIS STRANGE ACTIVITY AND THENY REALIZE THAT BREATHING WOULD DO IT AS WELL YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GET INTO COLD WATER AND THEN YEARS LATER WE DISCOVERED NOT WE MEANING MY LAB BUT OTHER LABS THAT WHEN YOU GET INTO COLD WATER EVEN JUST SIXTY DEGREE WATER THAT THERE'S A VERY LONG LASTING INCREASE IN DOPOMEN THAT IS TWO POINT FIVE EX ABOVE BASE LINE WHICH IS ON PAR WITH SOME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR INCREASING DOPOMEAN SO WHEN PEOPLE LAUGH AT ME O THIS COLD WATER THING I AT TEASE A LOT ON THE INTERNET I'VE HEARD ON THE INERNET THAT I THAT I EAT STICKS OF BUTTER WHICH I NEVER SAID I SAID I LIKE I SAID I LIKE BUTTER I'VE BEEN TOLD I'VE BEEN TOLD ALL SORTS OF THINGS I'VE BEEN TILD I EAT STICKS OF BUTTER I DON'T KNN WHY I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I'M DEAD THAT WAS AN INTERESTING ONE THAT'S ONE OF THE COOLER ONES THE UM BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS GOING OUT THERE IS A SERIOUS SCIENTIST AND SAYING OUSING DELIBERATE COLDICS POT YOU CAN USE ALL SORTS OF THINGS OR I OU NOIF YOU COME TO MY LAB BU BE HAPPY TO PUT YOU IN VIAR AND EXPOSE YOU ALL SORTS OF SCARYSTUFOR WE CAN INJECT YOU WITH A DRENALINE OR YOU CAN INJECT YOURSELF WITH A DRENALINE AND TITRATE THAT IT JUST THE LEVELS OF THAT SO T'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND I THINK THAT WHIM AND OTHERS DESERVE CREDIT FOR REALLY TAPPING INTO THAT AND AS A LAST POINT THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL STUDY IN THE PROSEENGS IN THE NATIONAL CADEMY A SCIENCES YEARS AGO USING THIS DELIBERATE SYCLIC I PREVENTILATION THING TWENTY FIVE BREATH AND THEN ANOTHER GROUPE MEDITATES AND THEN THEY INJECT THEM BOTH WITH E COAL IYE AND THE PEOPLE INJECTED WITH THE COALIE WHO MEDITATE GET NASHOUS VOMIT DIARRHOEA AND THEY GET A FEVER AND THE PEOPLE WHO FIRST FAR FEWUER SYMPTOMS IF ANY WHY BECAUSE A DRENALINE ACTUALLY SUPPRESSES A LOT OF THESE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES IN A WAY THAT'S HEALTHY IN THE SHORT FROM THIS IS WHY YOU CAN WORKWORKWORKWORK WORK WHERE YOU CAN STUDY FOR FINALS YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF A LOVED ONE AND THEN YOU FINALLY STOP AND REST AND GO ON VACATION AND THEN YOU GET SICK STRESS ACTIVATES YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IN DOING SO IT ACTIVATES YOUR MUNS AS TO MAKES PERFECT SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT HOW WOULD WE EVER GO THROUGH FAMINE IF YOU'RE JUST GETTING FLUES WHENEVER YOU'RE STRESS WE CAN DEAL WITH A LOT MIGHT SUGGESTION IS IF YOURE COMING OFF A PERIOD OF HIGH STRESS TO DO SOME SORT OF A DRENALIN SPIKING BEHAVIOR AS YOU TAPER OUT OF THAT STRESSFUL PERIOD NOT GOING STRICTLY TO MISSAGE VACATION AND OGANEDER ALL DAY LONG AS I WOULD  REFLECTIVELY DO CAN RED LIGHT THERE IP BE HELP TREET EXERCISE IN TOLERANCE AND FATIGUE AND MITA CONDREL DISEASE ALISON I I'M GLAD YOU'V BROUGHT THE SUP THERE YOU KNOW T THIS IS ANOTHER CASE WHERE I THOUGHT ONA THIS RED LIGHT STUFF IS CRAZY AND THEN I GOENT INTO THE LITERATURE AND TURNS OUT THAT IN NINETEEN O EIGHT THE NOBOUT PRIZE WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN FOR PHOTOTHERAPY SO THERE WE GO AGAIN AND HERE YOU KNOW I'VE THI SLIDE I CHOSE NOT YOU SLIDES TO NIGH BUT I HAVE THE SLIDE THAT SHOWS A CAN KEYZY IN THE MAGIC BOSS AND STUFF FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND PSYCHODELICS AND PEOPLE GETTING INTO COLD WATER AND THEN HERE WE ARE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTYOU'VE GOT WIN HOFF AND MAT JOHNSON GIVING PEOPLE MACRODOSES OF SYLICIDE AND WE'RE RIGHT BACK WHERE WE WERE AND ONE OF MY MAJOR GOALS IS TO REALLY TRYING CREATE SOME SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION AROUND THESE THINGS THI STUFF IS CRAZY ON THE FACE OF IT BUT THERE ARE MECHANISMS THAT ARE REAL THAT UNDERLIGHT RED LIGHT BECAUSE IT'S LONG WAVE LENGTH LIGHT LONGER LITERALLY AS SUPPOSED O SHORTWAVELINGTH LIGHT CAN PENETRATE THROUGH THINGS LIKE SKIN AND CAN INDEED CHANGE MIHT OCONDRIA ONE OF THE MORE IMPRESSIVE RESULTS ON RED LIGHT COMES FROM MY GOOD FRIEND GLEN JEFFREY'S LAB AT THE UNIVERSY CALLEGE LONDON NOWN GLEN FOR YEARS AA FEW YEARS O WAS HE BASIC VISION SCIENTISTS AND A FEW YEARS AGO HE STARE TO USING RED LIGHT YOU'D HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT RED LIGHT AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO FEET IN THE MORNINGS IS LONG WAVOE LENGTH LIGHT AND SOMETIMES EVEN JUST TAKE A FLASHLIGHT A TORCH AS THEY CALL IT IN ENGLAND AND COVER IT WITH A RED FILM AND THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE STUFF FOR A FEW MINUTES EACH MORNING AND IT CAN REVERSE SOME FORMS OF AGE RELATED VISION LOSS AND MACULAR DEGENERATION HOW WE NOW KNOW IT CAN PROVE MYTOCONREAL FUNCTION IN PHOTORECEPTORS BY REDUCING WHAT ARE CALLED REACT OF OXYGEN SPECIES HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING IT ONLY SEEMS TO WORK IN PEOPLE OLDER THAN FORTY AND IT SEEMS TO ONLY WORK IF YOU DO IT WITHIN THE FIRST THREE HOURS AWAKING AND THET INCREDIBLE THING AS YOU CAN DO THIS FOR ONE OR TWO MINUTES A WEEK AND SOME OF THE POSITIVE EFFECTS LAST AS LONG AS THREE WEEKS AND IT'S EFFECTING A VERY SPECIFIC FORM OF VISUAL IMPROVEMENT WHICH IS A CUITY CON FIND DETAIL STUFF IN MY PARTICULAR WAVE LENGTHS O PARTICULAR COLOR IS AN OBJECTS AND THINGS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE SO YES RED LIGHT CAN IMPROVE MY TOCONDURAL FUNCTION TO THE PHOTO RECEPTERS IF YOU ARE IN A TRYING DO THIS STUFF DON'T PUT IT TO CLOSE UM I DON'T HAVE ANY EFFILIATION ANY RED LIGHT PANOLL COMPANY SO I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING THERE THEY ARE RATHER EXPENSIVE NOWADAYS PEOPLE ARE PUTTING RED LIGHT EVERYWHERE AND I DO MEAN EVERYWHERE PEOPLE BRING RED LIGHT ON THEIR STOMACH FOR IMPROVING A VERY UNFUNCTION WHETHER NI CAN PENETRATE IS 'N CLEAR TO ME ALLTHE WY DOWN THEIR PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO THIS AH AH 'VE A FRIEND I WON'T NAME HIM RECENTLY TO ME IS REALLY INTO THE RED LIGHT THERAPY I'S PUTTING IT ON HIS TESTACLES TO TRYIN INCREASED TUSTOSTERON BUT HE TOLD ME THAT AFTER HE HANDED ME THE RED LIGHT TRUST MY TAM NOSES IS IT'S NON ON MY T MIGINISISI AH THAT'S THE SUPERINTERESTING UM I ACT YOU DON'T THINK YOU WANT A CONTACT THE RED LIGHTS DIRECTLY TO YOUR SKIN SO RED LIGHT IS POWERFUL I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ASIDE FROM THE VISION PROTOCAL I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S CLEAR WHICH PROTOCALS ARE BEST I WI'LL SAF YOUR INTO RED LIGHT IN FOR RED SANA TYPICALLY THOSE DON'T GET HOT ENOUGH TYPICALLY IF YOU WANT TO GET THE BENEFITS OF SANA YOU WANT TO GET BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED DEGREES SELCIEST WHICH IS HUNDREDN SEVENTY SIX TO A TO TEN YOUR TO OEIGHT FERENHEIGHT AND NOT I DON'T ACTUALLY DO THE CONVERSION ON MY HEAD UM I MEMORIZE IT YOU MENTION THE CONSEQUENCES OF LASTING OA RIN WITH TOO MUCH DOPE O ME IS A POSSIBLE TO OVERDO ICE BASWELL FALLING THE SAME LINE OF THINKING WE EXPERIENCE EXTREME LOW AN DOPE OM YOUA TOO MANY ICEBAT LUCI UNC UM THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ANY BEHAVIOR THAT SPIKES O DRUNNAL AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY GET BETTER AT TOLERATING IT YOU WILL BECOME COLD ADAPTED AND YOU'LL BECOME COMFORTABLE AT HIE DRENLIN STATES AND YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THIS IT'S JUST LIKE LIFTING WEIGHTS IN THE GIM ARE RUNNING YOU NEED TO LEAVE SOME SPACE FOR IMPROVEMENT SO IF YOU RUN AS PEOPLE DO AND YOU DO YOUR HALF MERIT YOUR FIVEK TAN YOUR TEN K THAN YOUR HALF MERATHON MAYBE A TEN KIS A HALF MERITHON IM I DON'T KNOW BUT ANYWAY THEN YOU'R DOING YOUR MARITHON THAN YOU'RE DOING ULTRAS THAT ARE FIFTY MILES AND HUNDRED MILEHS I MEAN EVENTUALLY YOU'RE GON START DOING DAMAGE RIGHT AND EVENTUALLY YOU'LK GAT EVERY ULTRA RUNNER AND TYPICALLY THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY MUCH OF THE DOP OMEN PURSUIT SYSTEM I MAN I DON'T THINK THAT HE WOULD MIND MY MY GOOD FRIEND AND A POTCASTER Y HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR IS OU N A RICH ROLL AMAZING HUMAN BEING AND ALSO AS A AMAZING STORY ABOUT A DICTION IT WAS AN ALCOHOLIK I'M NOT SHARING ANYTHING THAT HE HAS AN ALREADY SHARED IT IS AMAZING BOOK FINDING ULTRA YOU KNOW HE GOT REALLY INTO RUNNING RUNNING RUNNING ALL THE TIME AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A DOPE OF MEAN HISTORY THERE FOR HIM SOME OF US CAN YOUSE ICE BAS SO CONSISTENTLY AND MAKEING IT SO COLD AND DOING THEM LONGER AND LONGER THAT INDEED YOUR PLAYING WITH THE DOPOMING SYSTEM IS IT BAD WELL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR TRADING THAT IN FOR YOU MIGHT THE EXPENSE OF WHAT AS A GIVING UP COCANE YET GREAT STICK WITH THE ICE BATH BUT YOU KNOW CAN ONLY MAKE IT SO COLD AND YOUCAN ONLY STAY IN THERE SO LONG BEFORE YOU BECOME WHIM HOFF RIGHT AND IT WORKED OUT FOR WHIM BUT THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WHIM HOFF AND IN GENERAL THAT'S THAT SPEAKS TO A LARGER THEME WHICH AS I LOVE THE IDEA OF PEOPLE USING TOOLS AND UNDERSTANDING MECHANISM I MEAN OF COURSE I LOVE THAT IT'S WHAT I TALK ABOUT AN THINK ABOUT SO MUCH OF MY MY LIFE BUT FOR MOST OF US WE DON'T MAKE A LIVING DOING THOSE THINGS AND SO I DO THINK THAT THE IDEAL SITUATION IS TO HAVE BEHAVIORS IN TOOLS THAT YOU INTERSPERSE THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY AND THROUGHOUT THE WEEK FOR INSTANCE I THINK THREE TIMES A WEEK IS FINE FOR THE ICE BATH NO ONE SAID YOU HAD TO DO IT EVERY DAY BUT YOU SHOULD SEE SUNLIGHT EVERY MORNING IF YOU CAN JUST BECAUSE IT IF YOU MISS A DAY YOUR SYSTEM WILL BE FINE TUST SPEND TWICE AS LONG OUTSIDE THE NEXT DAY SERIOUSLY CAUSE IT'S A SLOW INTEGRATING SYSTEM BUT YOU KNOW FOR MOST OF THESE HIGH INTENSITY THINGS THE LESS OFTEN YOU DO THEM THE MORE POWERFUL THEY ARE IN FACT IF YOU GET INTO A VERY HOT SANA FOR FOR EXCUSE ME THIRTY MINUTE SESSIONS ON ONE DAYS YOU GO THIRTY MINUTES GET OUT FOR FIVE MINUTES THIRTY MINUTES GET OUT FOR VIMITES THIREE MINUTES GET OUT FOR  TWO HOURS A DAY IN THSON THAT'S A LOT OF SANA BUT THE GROWTHHORMON RELEASE FROM THAT STYPE OF PROTOCAUL IS A SIXTEEN AXS IMPRU INCREASE IN GROWTHHORMWHEN THIS HAS BEEN MEASURED INHUMANS OR AS IF YOU DO IT EVERY DAY OR THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK YOU GET DIMINISHING RETURNS ON THAT SO I ACTUALLYIM A BIG FAN OF DOING REALLY INTENT STUFF ONLY EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THIS IS ALSO I ONLY TAKE ONE LONG RUN PER WEEK ERE ONE LONG HEIGHT FIRST OF ALL IDN'T HAVE TIME FOR IT I'M NOT AN ULTRA RUNNER I GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO AND SECOND OF ALL IT'S A STRONG STIMULUS I'M SORE UNTIL TUESDAY OR I DON'T WANT A RUN UNTIL TUESDAY ANYWAY I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S FINE AND I ACTUALLY EN COURAGE AND OF MORE HEALTHY RATIONAL SCHEDULES OF THESE KINDS OF BEHAVIORS THERE'S NO RULE THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING EVERY DAY EVEN IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ENGAGE INERAL PLASTISCITY YOU CAN LEARN FRENCH OR AN INSTRUMENT BY PRACTISING THREE TIMES A WEEK AS LONG AS YOUR PRACTISE IS VERY FOCUSED I DAILY PERHAPS WOULD BE BETTER BUT VERY FEW OF US HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS EVERY DAY CONSISTENTLY AND I'VE REALLY ONTENCOURAGE OF MORE BALANCED APPROACH BEFORE WORKING THROUGH THASH OR WHAT'S THE BASE O COULDNESS GRACES THE SCAPEBOARDERS ARE ALWAYS IN THE HOUSE MY FIRST ANDON BIOLOGICAL FAMILY WAS ESCAPEBOARDING COMMUNITY WHEN I I I'VE GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARENTS NOW BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE TO GO TO SOCKER GAMES OR DOING G THAT STUFF THE SCAPE WORK COMMUNITY TOOK ME IN CAUSE THEREWERE NO PARENTS INVOLVED IT WAS GREAT THERE'RE NO REFERES OR COACHES AS IDN'T LIKE AUTHORITY ND IT WAS IT WAS OSSOM AND THERE WAS NO NUTRITIONAL PLAN YOU DRANK YOUR SLIRPING YOU SAT ON THE CURB AND IT WAS FANTASTIC I DON'T DO THAT ANY MORE BUT THE SCAPE WORKING COMMUNITIES ONE THAT I'V I'VE REMAINED CLOSE WITH UM I DID RIGHT FOR THRASHER UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME WHILE I WAS APPOST OC TO MAKE SOME EXTRA CASH UM YOU WON'T FIND THOSE ARTICLES ANYWHERE I HOPE UM THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD AND I BE SCAPE YOUR LI WAS INVOLVED IN IT ENOUGH THAT I'D THIS ONLY MAKE SENSE LIKE THREE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE BUT I DECENT HEEL FLIP I COULD KNOLLI BETTER THAN I COULD OLLY AND I WAS NEVER VERY GOOD AND I JUST OTHER MORE SCAPLERS THAN OS WHY WELL SAY THOUGH AS YET TO BE VERY CAREFUL ESCAPE ORDERS CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CLAIM THAT I WAS ANY GOOD  ANY ANY UM SUCCESS I HAD WAS OUT OF SYMPATHY OF OTHERS FOR LETTING ME HANG AROUND IT WAS 'S A GREAT COMMUNITY AND IT GAVE ME GREAT APPRECIATION FOR INDEED COMMUNITIES OF KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE A YOU KNOW STRUCTURE AND AND SPORTS LEAGUES AND TEAMS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF NOWADAYS IT'S IT'S ASHLY A MUCH DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE AND I HAVE TO ALSO SAY WHAT IT'S REALLY AMAZING TO SEE ALL THE INCREDIBLE UM GIRLS AND WOMEN SCAPE ORDERS ALSO THE'RE WERE NONE IT'S A LIMPIC SPORT NOW FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS AND FOR AND AND IT'S ONLYP ICPORT FOR FOR BOYS MEN TO SO IT'S IT'S AWSOME TO SEE THAT COMMUNITY O K WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE RAINHACKS FOR DOING HORRID THINGS RANGING FROM COLD EXPOSURE TO GETTING THROUGH GETTING THROUGH SELECTION HOPE DARLING THANKS FOR THE QUESTION YA UM WHO HARD THINGS WELL I'LL I'LL BE HONEST I LEARNED HOW TO HACK INTO MY A DRENALIN SYSTEM A LONG TIME AGO THROUGH THE WORST POSSIBLE MECHANISM WHICH IS THAT I WOULD SET UP BATTLES IN MY MIND I WOULD I WOULDGET INTO COMPETITION WITH PEOPLE IMAGINED OR REAL OR I WOULD I GET INTO STATES OF FEARING A SHAME AND UM YOU KNOW SCREWING UP SO I WOULD YOU CAN THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO I THINK YOU HAND UP SCARING YOURSELF INTO TRYING TO DO THE HARD THING AND IT WORKS THE PROBLEM IS IT IT FEELS RATHER UM I LIKE A DOWNWARD SPIRAL BECAUSE THOSE NEGATIVE STATES OF MINE WORK TO LIBERATE A DRENALIN AND GET YOU IN IN THROUGH HARD THING SO BEING YOU KO AS A KIND OF REBELLIOUS KID YAN RESISTANCE WAS IF SOME ONE TOLD ME I COULDN'T DO SOMETHING IYET TRY ME UM THIS KIND OF THING AND I IS I MENTION BEFORE I WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT AUTHORITY AND SO THAT WAS THE METHOD FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN THEN I STARTED READING OLIVER SAXES BOOKS AND I STARTED LEARNING FROM PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO ACCESS THINGS THROUGH THIS WHOLE LOVE THING AND I TRIED THAT LOVIND KINDNESS MEDITATION THING AN THAT DIDN'T WORK AND WHAT I STARTED DOING IS I ACTUALLY I'LL JUST TELL YOU WHEN I BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE TO NIGHT AND BEFORE I DO ANYTHING CHALLENGING I HAD I JUSTS ACTUALLY LIKE TO IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUPPORTED ME IT'S IT'S A WEIRD TOOL IT ONLY HAVE EVER SHARED I'M ACTUHE SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSE TO SHARE THIS OUT UM CAUSE HEREONLY TWO THINGS THAT MAKE ME CRY AND THAT'S TALKING ABOUT MY BULL DOG AND TALKING ABOUT MY GRADUAT ADVISER AND I IF I TALK ABOUT ANY LONGER IL PROUBLY CRYBUT I THINK ABOUT THEM A LOT UM BECUSE HEWERE KIND OF SIMILAR UM THEY WERE KIND OF O ARNERY AND THEY WERE HARD ON ME AND AND I ADORED THEM BOTH AND SO I THESE DAYS I TRY AND THINK ABOUT PEOPLE THAT AH THAT REALLY THAT I LOVE AND SO I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS WHOLE LIKE DOING THINGS FROM A PLACE OF LOVE THING AND SO FOR ME THAT'S ANIMALS AND PEOPLE AH THAT I LOVE HAS ANO HOW KE NOW NOW I AM BETTER MOVE ON SO AH THANK YOU LOOKET THEY'RE TELLING ME ONE MORE QUESTION SO I'M GOING TO ANSWER ONE WHAT DO I FEAR HOW DO YOU MANAGE YOUR FEAR CABE GOSH THIS IS GON A TURN INTO A KNOWONE TON ME SATISFIED UNTIL I CRY I GET IT I GET IT UM I DO CRY BUT AGAIN ABOUT THE THINGS I MENTION BEFORE I REALIZE SOMETHING BY THE WAY WE JUST RECORD AN EPISODE ON GRIEF T HASN'T COME OUT YET A FASCINATING TOPIC A I REALIZE AT ONE POINT BY THE WAY I'LL JUST GIVE THIS AWAY THAT UM I THOUGHT I WAS REALLY SAD ABOUT LOSING THEM I THOUGHT I WOULD TEAR UP REALLY EASILY BECAUSE O SATABON THEM BUT THEN I REALIZE THIS GASHA CANT LE WOMA DO THIS BUT I REALIZE THAT FEELING THAT I WAS FEELING IS THE EXACT SAME FEELING OF LOVE THAT I HAD WHEN THEY WERE ALIVE SO GRIEF IS LOVE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURITS IT'S BASICALLY THAT BUT YOUR BRAIN IS FREEKING OUT BECAUSE THAT MAP OF KNOWING WHERE PEOPLE ARE IN SPACE AND TIME GRIEF IS BASICALLY A REMAPPING OF THE SPACE WHERE ARE THY TIME WHEN ARE THEY AND THEN THIS A KIND OF ABSTRACT MAP REPRESENTATION THAT WE CALL CLOSENESS AND GRIEF IS THIS PROCESS OF RIPPING OURSELVES OFF OF THAT SO IN ANY EVENT WHAT DO I FEAR TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS UM WHAT DO I FEAR UM QUITE HONESTLY THE MY BIGGEST FEAR THE THING THAT WOULD JUST MAKE ME FEEL JUST HORRIBLE IS I I FEAR LETTING DOWN MY FRIENDS I HAVE AN AMAZING I LOVE MY FAMILY AND THEY'RE WONDERFUL BUT I HAVE THIS IN INCREDIBLE RELATIONSHIP TO FRIENDSHIP AND UM I JUST I ADORE MY FRIENDS AND I WOULD SOONER GIVE UP ALL MY LIMBS AND DIE BEFORE I WOULD I WOULD DELIBERATELY LET THEM DOWN SO THERE YOU GO THAT'S WHAT I FEAR MOST I ALSO FEAR I'VE GONE LONG AND SO MY TEAM HAS SHUT THIS DOWN I JUST WANTED JUST BRIEFLY UM A TWO THINGS A FIRST OF ALL I I OF COURSE WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR COMING HERE TO NIGHT A I REALIZE IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AND TO COMMIT SOME HOURS OF YOUR LIFE TO THINKING ABOUT THESE BRAIN MECHANISM IS BUT WE OUHT PRETTY NURTY THERE FOR A MINUTE UM AND HOPEFULLY THE TOOLS I REDEEM THOSE A WHO WERE ONLY A INTERESTED ERE MOSTLY INTERESTED IN PRACTICAL TOOLS BUT HOFULLY SOME OF THE INSIGHTS ABOUT HOW YOU WORK WERE RE USEFUL AS WELL I DO WANT I JUST MAKE BRIEF MENTION OF THIS PONSERS THAT MADE THIS POSSIBLE CAUSE THEY DID MAKE THIS POSSIBLE AND WE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO TRY AND KEEP THE TICKAPRIZE IS MANAGEABLE FOR PEOPLE AND A THANKS INSIDE TRACRON MOMENTOUS FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE AND THEN OF COURSE I WOULD BE COMPLETELY REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN SCIENCE THAK SO MUCH EVER UNBE SURE TO GET HOME SAKLY T NIN

FROM W B S CHICAGO IS THIS AMERI CAN LIE FROM YR CLASS SO WHAT OF OUR PRETTYSERS CONICHOFFHE WALT HAS SPEEN FEW YEARS REPORTING ON THE HISTORY OF ONE SCHOOL IT'S A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN A BIG CITY AND THETHE BEGINNING CONO THOUGHT THE STORY WAS ABOUT SEGREGATION AND IN EQUALITY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT THE MORE SHE SPOKE TO PEOPLE A RESEARCH WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THIS ONE SCHOOL THE WHEN SHE REALISED IT WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT THE INORDINATE AMOUNT OF POWER THAT WHITE PARENTS HAD AT THIS ONE SCHOOL AND SHE FOUND SO MANY STORIES SAIY THAT WE REALIZED WE COULDN'T FIT AT ALL INTO ONE EPISODE OF OUR PROGRAMMIN THAT WE WED E RELASED IS ITS OWN LITTLE MANY SERIES PODCAST SO LAST WEE A LITTLE THREE MINUTE TRAILOR WAS RUGYS THE NAME THE SHOW WIS NICE WHITE PARENTS AND EVEN BEFORE THE FIRST EPISODES APPEARED IT BECAME THIS WAR THOUSANDS OF RATINGS AND COMMENTS ON WINE AT APPLE POD CASS PEOPLE SAYING IT'S DEVISIVE THAT IT'S RACES TO TALK ABOUT WHITE PARENTS GIVING THE SHOW ONE STAR REVIEWS OTHER PEOPLE GIVING IT FIVE STAR REFEWS TO CANCEL OUT THE ONE STAR REVIEWS REMEMBER NOBODY HAD HEARD THE SHOW YET COMMENS WERE ABOUT SOME IMAGINED THING THAT PEOPLE'F THOUGHT THAT THE SHOW WOULD BE RATHER THN THE ACTUAL STORY THAT CONATELLS WHICH IS YOU NO CCOUNT OF FUNNY I THINK IT ALSO SPEAKS TO HOW THE ENTIRE SUBJECT FREEKS PEOPLE HAD SO MUCH WHITE PARENTS HOW RARELY THAT IS EXPLICITELY NAMED AS THE SUBJECT OF REPORTING THERE IS SO MUCH REPORTING WHEN PEOPLE OF COLOR AS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SO LITTLE REPORTING ON WHITE PEOPLE AS WHITE PEOPLE EVEN WHEN TEREE THE HEART OF A STORY AS THEYE ARE WITH THIS ONE AND WHEN YOU LISTEN A WHAT HONT OF FOUND YOU FEEL HORERITIS I PERSONALLY FOUND IT ELIMINATING YOU CAN WHISON AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF TO DAY WE'RE PRESENTING RIGHT HERE ONE OF THE STORIES AT HON O TELLS IN HER SERIES ABOUT ONE OF THE BIG TURNING POINTS IN THE SCHOOL'S RECENT HISTORY AH BEFORE WE STARTED ON A NOTE EVERYTHING YOU CAN HEAR THIS HOURS RECORDED BEFORE CRON OF IRIS ARRIVED SO IT IS A WORLD WERE PEOPLE YOU DONT GET TOGETHER PERSON WITH NO MASS OR ANYTHING DON'T BE SHOCKD AREN'T HERE'S ONE I STERTED REPORTING THIS STORY AT THE VERY SAME MOMENT AS A TURN OF FIGURE OUT MY OWN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SUBJECT OF THE STORY WHITE PARENTS IN NERC CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS I WAS ABOUT TO BE ONE OF THEM WHEN MY KID WAS OLD ENOUGH AS STARTED LEARNING ABOUT MY APTIONS AND MANY THERE WAS ORE IS OWNED PUBLIC SCHOOL AND BROOKLAN ERE I COULD APPLY TO A HANDFULL OF SPECIAL T PROGRAMMS I GIFTED PROGRAMM OR MAGNET SCHOOL OR LANGUAGE PROGRAMME SO  SERD TO LOOK AROUND THIS WAS FIVE YEARS AGO NOW BUT I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THESE TORES I'D SHOW UP IN THE LOBBY OF THE SCHOOL AT THE TIME LISTED ON THE WEBSITE LOOK AROUND AND NOTICED THAT ALL OR ALMOST ALL F THE OTHER PARENTS HER'D SHOWN UP FOR THE ELEVEN A M MIDDLE OF THE WORKDAY EARLY IN THE SHOPPING SEASON SCHOOL TOR WERE OTHER WHITE PARENTS AS A GROUP WE'D WALKD THE HALLS FOLLOWING A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR ALMOST ALWAYS A MAN OR WOMAN OF COLOR THERE WAS SCHOOL FULL OF BLACK AND BROWN KIDS WE'D PEER INTO CLASS FRM WINDOWS LATCHED THE KID SIT IN A CIRCLE ON THE RUG ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LUNCHMEN HOMER POLICY DISCIPLINE SOME OF US WOULD TAKE NOTES AND THE ADMINISTRATORS WOULD SELL THE WHOLE THING WAS ESSENTIALLY A PIT WE OF FER STEM WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH LINKIN SENTER WE HAVE A DANCE STUDIO THEY WERE PLEADING WITH US TO PLEASE TAKE PART IN THIS PUBLIC SCHOOL AN NOT THINK HAVE EVER FELT MY OWN CONSUMER POWER MORE VISORLY THAN I DID SHOPPING FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL AS A WHITE PARENTS WE WERE ENTERING SCHOOLS THAT PEOPLE LIKE US HAD IGNORED FOR DECADES THEY WERE NOT OUR PLACES BUT WE WERE BEING INVADED TO MAKE THEM AURENTS THE WHOLE THING WAS MADE SO MUCH MORE AWKWARD BUT THE FACT THAT NOBODY ON THOSE TOWARDS EVER ACKNOWLEDGED THE OBVIOUS RACIAL DIFFERENTS THAT ROUGHLY A HUNDRED PER SON OF THE PARENTS IN THIS GROUP DID NOT MATCH SAY NINETY PER CENT OF THE K IDS IN THIS BUILDING I REMEMBER ONE TIME BEING GUIDED INTO A CLASSROOM AND BEING TOLD THAT THIS WAS THE CLASS FOR GIFTED KIDS AND NOTICING OH HERE'S WER ALL THE WHITE KIDS ARE EVERY ONE OE OUR TOR SAW THIS ALL OF US PARENTS BUT NOBODY SAID ANYTHING INCLUDING ME WE WALKED OUT INTO THE HALLWAY AMOM RAISED HER HAND AND SAID I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK AND THE GROUP GOT QUIET I WAS THINKING O KA HERE COMES BUT THEN SHE SAID DO THE KIDS ER PLAY OUTSIDE EVERY DAY I KNEW THE SCHOOLS WERE SAGREGATED I SHOULDN HAVE BEEN SURPRISE BUT THE TIME I WAS TORING SCHOOLS AS A PARENT I'D SPEND A FAIRAMOUNT OF TIME IN SCHOOLS AS A REPORTER I DONE STORIES ON THE STARK ANY QUALITY IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND I'D LOOKED AT SOME OF THE MANY PROGRAMS AND REFORMS WE'VE TRIED TO FIX OUR SCHOOLS SO MANY IDEAS WE'VE TRIED STANDARDIZED TESTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS WE'VE TRIED SMALLER CLASSES LONGER SCHOOL DAYS STRICTER DISCIPLINE LOOSER DISCIPLINE TRACKING DIFFERENTIATIONS WE'VE DECIDED THE PROBLEM IS TEACHERS THE PROBLEM IS PARENTS WHAT IS TRUE ABOUT ALMOST ALL OF THESE RE FORMS IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK FOR WHAT TO BROKEN FOR POWER SCHOOLS OUR FAILING WE FOCUSS ON WHO THEIR FAILING POOR KIS LACK KIDS AND ROWN KIDS WE ASK WHY AREN'T THEY PERFORMING BETTER WHY AREN'T THEY ACHIEVING MOR THOOLS ARE NOT THE RIGHTE QUESTIONS HERE IS A POWERFOL FORCE THAT IS SHAPING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARGUABLY THE MOST POWERFUL FORSE IT'S THERE EVEN WHEN WE PRETEND NOT TO NOTICE IT THI GONE THAT SCHOOL TOR IF YOU ONETO UNDERSTAND WHIRE SCHOOLS AREN'T BETTER THAT'S WHERE YE HAVE TO LOOK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHITE PARENTS THAT'S WHAT THIS STORY IS ABOUT A'M GOING TO TAKE YOU INSIDE O PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDING AND UTTERLY ORDINARY SCUAT THREE STORY NEAR CITY PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDING NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE I LIVE THIS ISN'T ONE OF THE SCHOOLS I TORD AND MY OWN KIDS DON'T GO HERE THEY'RE TOO LITTLE THIS IS A MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL CALLED THE SCHOOL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AS I SK THE STORY OF THIS SCHOOL AND IT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH WHITE PARENTS DOWN THE BLOCK SPAND SIXTY YEARS BUT THE PRART I WONE TO TELL YOU BEGINS IT AS I ASK AND THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN RITE BEFORE EVERYTHING AT THE SCHOOL CHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE STUDENT IT US I ASS WERE BLCK LETTYE KNOW AND MIDDLY STERN KIDS MOSTLY FROM WORKING CLASS AN POOR FAMILIES THAT YEAR LIKE THE YEAR BEFORE AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT THE SCHOOL WAS SHRINKING THE PRINCIPAL JILLAN JUMAN WAS WORRIED YAT SO A LAST TWO YEARS WE HAD A THIRTY SUDENTS AT OUR SIXGREAT CLASS AND SO IT WE REALLY HAVE ROOM FOR HUNDRED AH SO NUMBERS I THINK AH OR HARD MISS TRUMON STARTED TO REACH OUT TO FAMILIES FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD INVATING THEM TO PLEASE COME TIC A LOOK PARENTS ARE TO SHOWING UP FOR TORS OF ES I ASK MOSTLY GROUPS OF WHITE PARENTS MISS DRUMAN WAS THRILLED AND RELIEVED SHE WATCHED PARENTS THROUGH THE BUILDING SAYINGS THOUGHT ME ANY TIME IF ANY ONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS WEALLY ANYTHING AND WANT YOU TO FEEL COMFORTABLE AN MISS TRUMONT SAYS THEY DID HAVE QUESTIONS MOSTLY ABOUT THE POOR TEST SCHOORS THAT WAS FAIR MIS TRUMAN EXPECTED THOSE QUESTIONS SHE DID NOT EXPECT THE OTHER SET OF QUESTIONS SHE GOT A LOT FROM PARENTS IS THERE WEAPONS IS THERE  ARE YOU SCANNING ARE YOU WAS SCANNING SCHOOL BECAUSE KIGOR DAINGERESS THOUGH I'VE WEAPONS I'VE HEARD THAT THERE 'S ARRING LIKE METAL DETECTIVE RIHT I HEARD THES FIGHTS AND TO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL OUR TALKING ABOUT I HAVE NEVER  HEARD OF THAT INCIDENT EVER HAPPENING EVER SO THE FEARS OF WHAT THIS BUILDING IS AND WHAT THIS FILT BUILDING HAS REPRESENTED AH HAS COME TRANSIENTED ITSELF WE ALL LATE WEEK W T THERE'S A DIFFERENT STORY OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES OUTSIDE THE SFUILDING HOW MUCH OF THAT YO THINK IS RACISEM I THINK OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY IS FEARFUL OF THE UNKNOWN EXCELLENT PRINCIPOL ANSWER PRINCIPAL JUMN IS BLACK BY THE WAY SHE NEEDED THESE PARENTS SCHOOLS GET MONEY PERSTUDENTS A SHRINKING SCHOOL MEANS A SHRINKING BUDGED MISS JUMNNAS WORRIED IF THIS CONTINUED THE MIDDLE SCHOOL COULD BE IN DANGER OF BEING SHUT DOWN BY THE CITY AS I SK IS IN COBLE HILL BROOKLYN LEEFY STREETS BROWN STONES IT'S A WEALTHY WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S GOTTIN WEALTHIER AND WHITER IN THE LAST EGATE BUT WHITE FAMILIES WERE NOT SENDING THEIR KIDS AS  ASS TMISS JUMAN TOLD THESE PARENTS SHOS AS I ASK WERE TURNING THINGS AROUND WERE IN THE PROCESS OF BRINGIIN A NEW PRESTIGIOUS INTERNATIONAL BACKALORIA CRREULEN RENOVATING THE LIBRARY HERE'S THE NEW GORGEOUS YARD IT'S AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL THE PARENTS SEEMED INTERESTED BUT I BELIEVE THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD JUST AS MUCH TO DO WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL AS WHAT THEY WERE SEEING INSIDE THE BUILDING SURE SOME ONAMES ROB HANSO AN IM A APPARENT SO WE WERE THE MIDDLE SCHOOL PROCESSES O INTERESTING RO LIVES NEAR BY AS I ASK BUT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE SCHOOL I KNOW PROBLIN HIS DISTRICT ROB COULD CHOOSE FROM A LEATEN MIDDL SCHOOLS WHE MAJORITY OF WHITE FAMILIES SENT THEIR KIS TO THE SAME THREE SCHOOLS ROB'S WIT THOSE WERE THE SCHOOLS HE' HEARD OF AND THOSE WERE THE SCHOOLS HE TORD OS WA BUT THEY WERE PACTS OOLS THERE WERE TRO MANY WEALTHY WHITE FAMILIES IN THE DISTRICT TO CONTINUE CRAMMING INTO JUST THREE SCHOOLS THERE'S A COUPLE OF CITY WID ONCE WERE WE WANT WE STOOD ON LYINE FOR LIKE AN HOU AN HOU TO HAVE AND THAND JOINED IN AN AN AUDITORIUM FULL OF PARENTS AND THEN HAD THEM ANNOUNCE THAT THEY WERE EXCEPTING FIFTEEN STUDENTS IN THE FOLLOWING IN THE COMING CLASS AND THEY'D BEEN RUNNING TOWARDS ALL DAY   MOST CITIES HAVE SOME AMOUNT OF SCHOOL CHOICE LIKE THIS TORS AN OPTIONS NEAR CITY THOUGH IS AN AMPD UB VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENS ELSEWHERE THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION THE LEVEL OF WEALTH THE DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE SORTING INTO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS EVERYTHING IS MORE INTENSE ROB FOUND THIS PROCESS FRESH TRATING ALTHOUGH ROB IS VERY EVEN TEMPERED EVEN WHEN HE'S FRUSTRATED HIS CANADIAN WHEN HE GETS ESPECIALLY HOT HE STARTS CALLING THINGS INTERESTING AND THIS WHOOLMIDDLE SCHOOL THING WAS VERY INTERESTING HE ASKED OF THEIR PARENTS ON SCHOOL TRS WHAT AR WE GET A DE SOME ONE SAID HAVE YOU GES HEARD OF AS I ASK THAT BUILDING DOWN THE BLOCK ROB HADN'T THE OTHERS HADN'T THEY DECIDED TO ALL GO CHICK IT OUT TOGETHER I WALKED AWAY LOT'S PARENTS WACK TOWAY FROM THIS TORS THINI WA YOU KNOW PEOPLE JAMMING UP INTO SOME SCHOOLS AND AND YOUR YOUR LEAVING SIXTYR SEVENTY SEES EMPTY EMPTY ALL YOUR LONG YOU THIRTY KIDS A DOESN'T THAT'S YOU SPREAD THEM OUT AROUND AND THAT'S A BIG SCHOOL THAN ALL THE SUDDEN YOUR SORT OF LIKEUAGE SECOND WATS THERE'S NOBODY HERE TAS ROB TORD AS I AS HE HAD AN IDEA THAT NIGHT HE EMILLED PRINCIPAL JUMAN AND HE ASKED WOULD SHE BE OPENE TO STARTING A DUAL LANGUAGE FRENCH PROGRAMM AT AS I ASS THEY HAD ONE AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL RABS KIDS WENT TO AND EVERYONE LOVED IT SURE PRINCIPAL JURMANN WAS OPEN SO ROBS THERED ED SPREADING THE WORD AS I AS IS STARTING A DUAL LANGUAGE FRENCH PROGRAMM WE SHOULD ALL GO ROBSAYS THERE WAS INTEREST BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HE TALK TO HAD THIS QUESTION WET ARE OTHER PEOPLE GOING AN THT SANLYS HAD THAT KIND OF FERE LIKE WHAT IF IM YOUKOW IF I LOOK AROUND NOBYHAS CAME WITH ME AND A AND I CAME FOR SOMETHING AT'S NOT HERE BECAUSE NOBODY SOI'S A COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM WE WISE A COLLECTIVA WHY WHITE YOU NEED TO COLLECTIV AH JUST AN THE JUST  I THINK OVER ALL THERE'S A COLLCETED ACTION IS HOU O BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THIS AN PART BECAUSE OF THE FRENCH TOA LANGUAGE PART OF IT AM IF IF YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE TO SHOW UP THERE'S NO FRENCH TEACHER FOR ONCE TO BUT THERE'S A PROGRAV IF FIFTEEN COM IF TWENTY COP BUT WE ALL HAVE TO THEN TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD EXACTLY THE SAME TIME THE VISION REQUIRES PEOPLE TO COME AND WHAT AFE NOBODY COPS WHEN IT CAME TIME TO CHOOSE MIDDLE SCHOOLS PARENTS WERE SUPPOSED TO RANK THEIR TOP CHICES RATE BEFORE THEY DID BEFORE EVERY ONE CHOSE THEIR SCHOOLS RABSONT TO SURVEY OUT TO THE FAMILIES HE'D BEEN TALKING TO TO TRY THE IN SURE THAT A GROUP OF THEM WOULD CHOOSE AS I ASK TOGETHER IT WAS A SIMPLE SURVEY MONKEY IF ENOUGH PEOPLE CID YES THEY RANK AS I ASK AS ONE OF THEIR TOPTICKS AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ACT AS A COLLECTID PEOPLE SAID YES THE NUMBERS WERE STUNNING AND TWO DESN'T FOURTEEN THERE HAD BEEN THIRTY SIX GRATERS AT AS I ASK AND TWO DOESEN FIFTEEN THERE WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND THREE THAT TWO HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY WAK KIDS DID YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF AS IN TEGRATERS OR DID YOU THINK AOT MY PAUSE WAS BECAUSE I WAS TRYNI THINK AP IF THAT HAT CON TRO LINE DIDN'T NO NO THE AM NOT INTIGRATORS AM POR DISPENT IN T E SCHOOL THAT WAS GWICHKIN POSTLY BE DIVERSE AM BUT THET NOT I THAT'S NOT A FRAMING OR WAY O THINKING ABOUT THAT IT WOULD HAVE OCCURE TO ME THE TIME AM NOBODY I TALKED TO FROM ASS I ASK CHARACTERIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE AS INTEGRATION THE CURES WHY IN TEGRATION WAS ON MY MINDS THE NEAR CITY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS AWARE THEIR SCHOOLS WERE SIGREGATED IT WAS ALSO AWARE THAT THESE SEGGREGATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO CLOSE THE GAP AN ACHIEVEMENT BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE STUDENS BUT IT DID NOT WANT TO MANDATE RATIAL INTEGRATION THROUGH ZONING OR SCHOOL PLACEMENTS THE CITY WAS TRYING TO MAKE INTEGRATION HAPPENED THROUGH CHOICE HOPING TO LURE WHITE FAMILIES INTO SEGGREGATED SCHOOLS THE SCHOOL TOURS I WENT ON FOR MY OWN KIDS THO SPARKLEY PROGRAMS AND A MENEDIES THAT WAS THE NEW APPROACH TO INTEGRATION BUT CAN THIS WORK FOR WHITE PARENTS TO OT IN TO INTEGRATION NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO OR BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A SELLING POINT BECAUSE WE GET A DANC STUDIO AND STEM AND A SCHOOL THAT WAS HOPEFULLY DIVERSE INTOGRATION WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT RACE THE KINS AT SA S O THE DID TIKE ABOT I IMMEDIATELY A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE FIRST FEW WEKS OF SCHOOL A SENIOR NAMED CHRISTON MANS OVER TO HER CLASS MAKE CRESS AND MUMBLES THEY'RE AT A WAT KITS IN THE SCHOOL AND CHRIS SAYS OH YE A TEACHER WARN ME ABOUT THAT OVER THE SUMMER BUT YE TODME OL THER TO GON BE A LOT OF WHIT KITS COMING AN FRENCH WIKE KIDS FROM I PER ECONOMIC STATISIS WOUL PREPARED FOR THAT CHRISTEN NODS  YEI GESS WE WERE PARED AND THEN SHE TURNS TO ME  TO SAY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN READY FOR THAT WE SAW THE PARENTS ON THE TOURS LAST YEAR S  WOA SO THE MOLK THO THE HALL BU WE NEVER NEW WAS SO SERIOUS HAT A WHOLE GROUP OF COCKAS WOULD COMIN O'LL BE S SO DIVERS BUT WHOSE TAKE SUCH A BIG CHANGE I THAT'S A BEIN PREJUDICS I THING THAT I NOTICE LIKE THE BIG CHANGE HIH SCHOOLIS ARE MORE HISPARICS AN BAKS WITH THA FEW COCCASIONS I MAKE THE NEW GU THAT CAME IN ALL COCCASIONS TATE THEY TRI TO ME SO DIVERSE DIVERSETHIS WAS A WORD I HEARD OVER AND OVER IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF SCHOOL DIVERSITY I LOVE DIVERSITY SAW THAT IT DOESN'T LIKE SO WHUL I TI SEE LIKE OTHER WHIIS OM LIKE SO DIVERSITY SEEMED TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS WAT FAMILIS WOULD TALK ABOUT ALL THE DIVERSITY IT AS I ASK AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT BLACK IN HIS PANNIC KIDS WHEN KIDS OF COLOR NOTED THE DIVERSITY THEY WERE REFERRING TO THE NEW WAT KIDS FOR LATI KIDS A COLOR THIS LOOKED ALOT LIKE SOMETHING THEY'D ALREADY SEEN HAPPEN IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOODS WHITE FAMILIES SHOWING UP IN LARGE NUMBERS TAKING OVER STORES FAMILIAR SPOTS THERE'S A WORD FOR THAT IT'S GENTRIFICATION BUT I NOTICE THAT NO ONE WAS USING THAT WORD ABOUT THE SCHOOL WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE WAS DIVERSITY THAT'S HOW THE ADULTS TALKED ABOUT IT DHIVERSITY IS A GOOD THING SOMETHING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE O PAYWES FOR THE MOST PART THE KIDS WORK IT WAS DIFFERENT FOR THE PARENTS SOME OF THEM A SPECIFIC ADVANTAGES TO THE DIVERSITY LIKE KANIA BLUNT THE CO VICE PRESIDENT OF THE PTIET AS I ASK HE WAS EXCITED HAVING THE NEW PARENTS COMING IN IN THE DIVERSITY THAT PIRCECLARLY BECOMES FROM THE THE NEWAS I'LL CALL THE NEW NEIGHBOURHOOD WE OFE INTERCHANGING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IM IS THAT  WE HAVE A GENTLEMAN WHO HIS PROFESSION IS FUN RAISIN ROB HANSON THE DAD WHO STARTED THE SURVEY MONKKEY ROB RAIS'S MONEY FOR NON PROFITS AND FOUNDATIONS FOR A LIVING OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR ALL HER ROB HANSON REFERRED TO AS

SCHOOL BASE FOUNDATION AT AS I ES THE PLAN AS TO CALL IT THE BROOKLIN WORLD PROJECT I ASKED ROB WHY DO YOU NEED ANOTHER WAY TO RAISE MONEY BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A PITIER MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF A SCHOOL PITIER WHY DO YOU NEED A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION ATS NO THE PITIER YET SO THE PROBABLY EASIEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT IS TO NOT THINK ABOUT IT FROM THE SCHOOL SIDE U TO THINK ABOUT IT FROM AH THE POTENTIAL DONER SIDE A SO BASIC IDEA T WERE FOLLOWING IS THAT THE THE TITIDNT THAT INTERNATIONALS AS WE WANT TO DO EXSTENDE DAY AND WE WANT A DO THEATRE AND SO WE GO WHEN WE FIND A DOWNER WHO LOVES THEATRE AND LOVES THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LOVES THE IDEA THAT KIDS WHOE NEVER SPOKEN FRENCH AND AT NO EXCPOSURE GET THE CHANCE TO GO AH AN COMPETE ACTUALLY AGAINST SOME OF THE MOST ESTABLISHE SCHOOLS IN THE CITY AND A DON'T A DIS LOVES ATH LI GOI LOVE IT I LOVE GIVING THAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY TO KIS I MA TO COVER ALL THAT BECAUSE I THING IT'S THAT IMPORTANT AH IF THAT MONEY GOES TO THE PTIER YOU COULD HAVE A SITUATION OF PTIER SAYS OR REMEMBERS THE PTIE SAY I DON'T KNOW THAT WE REALLY LIKE THE THEATRE PROGRAMM I'M NOT SURE I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE USING THOSE DOLLARS TO DO EXER WHY OR S NOW NORMALLY YOU BEAL TO SAY WELL DON'T ER INTEND IS WHAT IT IS YOU SHOULD PROABLY USE IT TOWARDS WHAT IT WAS INTENDED FOR I I NORMALLY IN ANOTHER FINDEYS AN CIN  MEANING IN NON PROFITS SO THERE'S A BASIC KIND OF MORALITY OF AN ON PROFIT TO SAY IF IT DON'T E GIVES YOU IT TO YOU TO DO SOMETHING YOU SHOULD TRY TO DO THAT DON'T ERINTENDS IN IMPORTANT PART OF IT TI FOR OFTHE TRUST THAT'S ESTABLISHED RB SAYS BECAUSE THE PITER IS A DEMOCRACY IT MAKES THINGS COMPLICATED THE VERY THING I SAW AS THE STRENGTH OF A PTIE ONE PARENT ONE VOTE TO ROB THAT S A PROBLEM FOR FUND RAISING PARENTE COME AND GO AND SCHANGED THEIR MINDS ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT A PRIVATE DON'TER ANTES TABILITY AND ROB IS TRYING O RAISE MONEY FOR THE KIND OF PROGRAMMING THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT HIS SONS WEALTHY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AT THAT SCHOOL RO WAS COO PRESIDENT OF THE PTIER AND THE PREVIOUS YEAR HIS PITIER PULLED IN CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS MONEY THAT PAID FOR AFTER SCHOOL FOR

TA HE A CAN THEY OUR POOR STRUGGLING CHOOL THAT ADN POSSIBLY MAK IT ON A TON WITHOUT THEIR MONEY IN THEIR VISION IM AND WE DID NOT ALL FEEP AT THAT I EARLY THE KATE WHAT DO YOU FEEL A THIS WAS A LONG CONVERSATION THE UPSHAT SHEIS NOT HAPPY BUT THE WAY THE NEW PARENTS ARE BEHAVING IT WAS TRUE A NEW NARRATIVE WAS TAKING HOLD AT ES I ASK IT FELT LIKE THE KIDS WERE TALKING ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME BUT IT WAS IN THE AIR AND THE KIDS WERE STARTING TO PICK UP ON WHO WAS VALUE IN WHY IN THE CANVATERIA I HER MIDDLE SCHOOL ER SAYING THE FRENCH KIDTS COULD KILL SOME ONE AND THEY GET AWAY WITH IT UPSTAIRS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL I HEAR KIDS COMPLAIN ALL THE ATTENTION AS SHIFTED TO THE NEW MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WE'RE BEING PUSHED ASIDE AN DOWN ON THE LIBRARY I MET THREE SIX RATE BOYS WHITE BOYS NEW TO ESS A S THEIRE

INTO ANY SCHOOL IS OTHER WHITE FAMILIES ONCE YOU HAVE A CRITICAL MASS OF WHITE KIDS YOU PASSED WHAT ONE CITY CALLS A BLISS POINT THIS IS A REAL THING RECERCHER STUDY HOW MANY WHITE KIDS ARE NEEDED AT A SCHOOL TO MAKE OTHER WHITE FAMILIES FEEL COMFORTABLE CHOOSING IT THAT NUMBER THE BLISS POINT IS TWENTY SIX PER CENT THAT FALL WHITE FAMILIES WERE CROWDING THE SCHOOL TOURS AT ESS A ES NOT BECAUSE THE TESCORS HAD IMPROVED THE NEWSCORES HADN'T EVEN COME OUT YET BUT BECAUSE THE OTHER WHITE FAMILIES MADE THEM FEEL BLISSFULLY COMFORTABLE OF COURSE THE THING THAT MAD THE NEW WHITE PARENTS

AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION HORACE MAN LEAD OUT HIS VISION FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS BACK IN THE DAY HE WROTE HIS HORSE ROUND MASSACHUSETTS PODIEMTOPOTIUM AND HIS PITCH WAS TOMMON SCHOOLS WOULD MAKE DEMOCRACY POSSIBLE THEY WOULD BIND US TO ONE ANOTHER AND DOCTRINATE US GIVE US THE KILLS AND TOOLS WE'D NEED FOR DEMOCRATIC LIVING PUBLIC SCHOOLS HE BELIEVED WOULD BE THE GREAT EQUALIZER RICH AND POOR WOULD

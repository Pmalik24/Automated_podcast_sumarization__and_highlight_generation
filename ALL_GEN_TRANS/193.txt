THIS IS A SIGN OF HIS DIPLOMATIC SKILLS HE SEEMED SO CALM SO CHO HET DE COULDN'T NOT ASK HIM ABOUT IT MAYBE THAT JUST OF FASAD BUT IT IS TIIT IS A FASAD TI HAD O TAT HEE I I LEARNED THE HARD WAY TO HOLD MYSELFS TOGETHER I THINK IL BREAK DOWN AFTER IT THINGS THES AR NOW I GET  IN THAT YOU GET IT AYOU GET IT TOGETHER I DOCTORS TAT ON TWICE  JUST BEFORE THE RECENCEES FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HMAS AND THEN DURING THE SEES FIRE AS INTERES IN TACKING TO HIM BECAUSE THE STAKES OF ANY PAWS IN FIGHTING SEEM SO HIGH FOR AID WORKKERS LIKE HIM FOR THIS HES FIRE SO LITTLE HUMANITARIAN ADE WAS ACTUALLY MAKING IT INTO GASA AND AFERIAGE IF ONLY FIFTY FIVE TRUCKS TO DAY ACCORDING TO THE UAN REMEMBER AT THAT POINT ALREADY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN ASA WULD DISPLACE FRIM THEIR HOMES AFTERIS HAD BEEN OPERATING WITHOUT AN ASESIA THAT IF PAIN COLLORS AND BASEIF MEDICINES FOOD AN WATER WHERE IN SHORT SUPPLY APAS IN FIGHTING WOULD MADE A CHANCE TO FINDWE GET STUFF THROUGH AND I WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE WAS PREPARING ANDWHAT HE HOPE WOU HAPPEN AN E ANSWER WAS ABOUT HIS PREPRATIONS HIS TEAM AN GAZA WAS GOING ROUND DOING WITH A BASINLY BEEN DOING FOR WEEKS TRYING TO FIGRE OUT WHAT THE GREATEST NEEDS WOR LIKE FOR INCENCE IN THE SCHOOLS AND OTHER BUILDINGS THAT ARE NOW THE MAIN SHELTERS FOR OVER A MILLION PEOPLE IN GASA THESE ARE INCREDIBLE OVER CROWDED PEOPLE LEEPING ON THE GROUND EVERYWHERE LIKE JUST TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF AN IMAGE  WOME ARE SLEEPING INSIDE THE ROOMS INSIDE THE SCHOOL SHELTER AND THE MEN ARE SLEEPING IN THE YARD OF THE SCHOOL TUT ALSO A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE IN THE STREETS AND ITS WINTER IT'S FREEZING AND THAT'S WHEN OUR THUMAN GAZA WAS LIKE WE NEED DENTS WE EED MATTRESSES WE NEED BLANKETS AND THAT'S WHAT IAVE BEEN DOING HERE AND IMMEDIATELY WE STARTED PROCUREMENT OFFENS S IN EGET LIKE THE FIRST THING I DID S THIT WENT TO THE FORT JOB AN THE KATHON LIKE THA THE FORT JOB AND I TOLD THEM LIKE HOW MANY THNTS DO YOU HAV BECAUSE THERE LIKE THER FOR CAMPING THERE ARE READY A THERE WE CAN PROCURE IMMEDIATELY BUT IN BY THESE TENS AS THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THEM AND TOKS PEND THE PROBLM I SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT EVEN BEFORE THIS WAR FOR YEARS NOW ISRAEL IS CONTROLLED NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT WEN IN AND OUT OF GASA GASA SURROUNDED BY GIANT FENCE IS PART OF THAT ISRAEL RESTRICTED SPECIFIC CERTAIN MEDALS AND CHEMICALS AND FABRICS FROM ENTERING GAA BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T WONE THEM TO FALL INTO MASA'S HANDS GET TURNED INT WEAPONS AGAINST ISRAEL OR FIND SOME MILITARY USE THIS AN OFFICIAL WIST OF RESTRICTED STAV IT LIKE WITH A TEND IS THE FABRIC A THERE CERTAIN TIPE OF FABRICS THAT ARE NOT ALLOWD AND THEN WE WERE LIKE OKES TO WITH HAS MATERIALS THAT IS TOT ALOD SO WE MEED THET DESIED OUR OWN TENCE AND THEN WE MEEDIT TO FINE AN THENDER WHO IS WILLING TO YOU

NOT WE WERE TALKING TWO DAYS BEFORE THE SEASE FIRE STARTED UT AT I'M'S ORGANIZATION AN NERA HAD HOPEINGE OF OTHER STUFF THAT WAS READY TO GO AND ENTER GAZA AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE TO DO THAT THE ROUGH ACROSSING FROM EGYPT INTO GAZA IT TAT I'M SAID THE TRUCKS COULD BE DELAYD THERE FOR DAYS WHILE EGYPTIAN AND HIS RAILLY OFFICIALS EACH INSPECT THE TRUCKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN FACT FILLED WITH HUMANITARIAN AD IT IS NEVER CLEER HOW MANY OF THESE TRUCKS WILL MAKE IT THROUGH OR F MANY OF GET THROUGH IS YOUR USED TO DO THESE INSPECTIONS AT BIG CHECK POINT CALLED KARAM CHALOM THERE WAS FULLY EQUIPED TO HANDLE LOTS OF INSPECTIONS BUT THAT A CHECKMON HAS BEEN CLOSE SINCE THE WAR STARTED THE ROFGH CROSSING JUST ISN'T SET UP FOR HIVOT IN MATRUCKS AND SATAM AND OTHER PEOPLE TRYING TO GET

THE STORY THE WAY WE HAVE TO START SO MANY ASYLUM STORIES BY EXPLAINING WHAT THE HELE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THESE JOBS ACTUALLY DO THE ONCE I TALK TO WERE ALL ASYLUM OFFICERS AT SOME POINT AND HEARE'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE THEY SIT IN AN OFFICE ON THE PHONE FOR HOURS WITH ASYLUM SEEKERS IN AN INTERPRETER ON THE LINE THEY'RE ASKING QUESTIONS HEARING BRUTAL STORIES FROM PEOPLE WHO RECENTLY CROSS THE BORDER ABOUT WHAT THEYIR FLEEING TENISWELL IN POLITICAL ACTOFIS ESCAPING THE GOVERNMENT CAMMERUNIANS FLEEING VILUNS SAW VADORN FAMILIES ESCAPING GANGS THE OFFICERS HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MIGRENS ER TALKING TO COULD GET LEGAL PROTECTION HERE UNDER OUESLAW AND WHETHER THEY COULD FACE HARM OR EVEN DEATH IF THEY GOT SENT BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY IT'S NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HART UT IT IS MORE FOR THE BLEEDING HARD CROWD THAN THE ENFORCEMENT CROWD THESE AREN'T THE TOUGHGY COPSY OFF IN FINE IN THE BORDER PATROL LOTS OF THE WORD FOR THE PEACE QUARRER LOTS OF PEOPLE WITHIN EMIGRATION LAW BACKGROUND OR HUMAN RITS THE UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR DECISIONS IN THESE CASES CAN DICTATE WHETHER SOME ONE LIVES OR DOINES AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAVE EVER TALK TO FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THAT IT'S A MORAL DUTY TO THEM NOT JUST A NIN DIFIE AFTER FOR YEARS OF PRESEDENT TRUMP DISMANTLING THE ASYLUM AND REFUGEY PROGRAMS AND CALLING THEIR WORK A CON THEY FELT DESPERATE FOR A CHANGE AND THEN IN THE

BECAUSE THESE FOLKS ARE NOT SIPLES TO TALK TO THE PRESS THEY COULD GET FIRED THAT'S ALSO WHY I CAN'T TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT MARK OR ANY OF THE OTHERS SHE'LL HERE WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAN MARK IS PRECISE HAND OVER ALL KIND OF A CARMIGON WONE SPIDE AN ONE MARK SAYS HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES EXPECTED THAT PRETTY EARLY ON HE'D END SOMETHING CALLED TITL FORTY TO TITLE FORTY TWO WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER THAT HAD BASICALLY CLOSE THE SOUTHERN BORDER TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COEN IT'D ALLOWED YUAS BORDER OFFICERS TO EXPEL MIGRANTS BACK INTO MEXICO WITH NO LEGAL FORMALITIES NO QUESTIONS ASKED HOURS AFTER THEY WERE COT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT IT IN PLACE ON THE PENDAMICET A SILUM AND REFUGEY OFFICERS THOUGHT THIS WAS ILLEGAL BECAUSE IT PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM EVEN BEING ABLE TO ASK FOR ASYLUM MARK AND HIS COWORKERS WERE LIKE EASY TRUMP ACTIVATED IT BIDN COULD JUST THE ACTIVATIT THE PERSON I TALKD TO WHO WAS THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE WHOLE THING HE SAY YU A S I S OFFICIAL I'M GOING A CALL GEORGE

STORY GEORGE DID ABOUT WHY THE ADMINISTRATION MADE THAT CHOICE POLITICAL OPERATORS AT THE WHITE HOUSE BE CAME CANFENCE THAT IT WAS BAD FOR THE PRESEDENT FOR THE TE VE TO SHOW WHAT WOULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS CA AS AT THE BORDER  I ASKE THE WHITE HOUSE OF THIS IS WHY THE PRESIDENT KEPT TITLE FORTY TWO GOING AND NOT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS THEY SAID IT WAS THE CD SES CALL NOT THE PRECEDENTS THE YOU A S  S WORKERS I TALK TO DIDN'T BUY THIS IN FACT GEORGE REMEMBERS HOW THE BIDAN ADMINISTRATION DOUBLED DOWN ON THIS ARGUMENT WHEN THE A CAL U SUED THE GOVERNMENT OVERTITLE FORTY TWO AND THEN YOU HADE THEM MAKING THESE ABSURD PUBLIC STATEMENTS THAT WERE PERITING THE THINGS THE TRUMPETMENISTRATION SAND ABOUT TITLE FOR TO WIT DEMOCRATIN LAUGHED AT AND THIS MES WHEN TRUMP WASS APONIS BUT WHEN THAY AT WOFO OH WE HAVE NOTHING DO IS THIS IS A SEE TO SETHIS IS RELATED UPON  ELSE NOT I MIGRATION OU KNOW KEEPING TITLE FORTY TWO GOING AS LONG AS THEY DID WAS AT WHAT THE HELL MOMENT FOR THE OUACE I S WORKERS A TURNING POINT SEEING ALL THESE PEOPLE TRYING TO SEEK ASYLUM STUCK OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS BECAUSE OF TITLE FORTY TO MADE THESE WORKERS FEEL ANGRY AND LONELY BUT THEY WERE THE ONLY WITNESSES TO ABRIGE COLLAPSING WELL EVERYONE ELSE LIKE THE OTHER WAY THIS NEXT PERSON I'LL CALL LESA SHE WORKS IN REFUGEY SERVICES SHE WAS ALSO THE ONLY OFFICIAL WHO DIDN'T SWEAR DURING OUR INTERVIEW I MEAN I STOPPD TALKING BET EITH MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO BE HONEST YOU DID YEH CAUSE ALL IT DOES HIS WORK ALL IT WOULD DO IS WORKIN ME UP INTO A FRIENZY A FRUSTRATION AND YOU KNOW THEY CAN ONLY LISTEN TO IT FOR SO MUCH ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ALL TWO WERE UNDER THE SILLUSION THAT OH BUT ISN'T IT SO MUCH BETTER OH WE UNDERSTAND REMEMBER HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS UNDER THE TRUMPEDMINISTRATION BUT ISN'T IT SO MUCH BETTER AND YOU WANT TO SAY LIKE YEDS IT'S BETTER IT'S WE'RE NOT UNDER FULL LEVEL DESTRUCTION ATTACK BUT ALSO PROMISES WERE MADE AND THE'RE NOT HAPPENING AND PEOPLE ARE STILL LIVING AN REFUGY CAMPS ON THE SOUTHERNSIDE OF THE BORDER AND NO ONE IS DOING ANYTHING TO HELP THEM YOU JUST YOU FEER LIKE YOU CAN'T TALK TO THE REGULAR WORLD ABOUT IT ANY MORE IN THE END IT TOOK PRESEDENT BY AN OVER A YEAR TO TRY TO END TITLE FORTY TO AND WHEN HE DID IT TEXAS SUED AND STOPTIM TITLE FORTY TO REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL MAY OF THIS YEAR IT WAS THERE THROUGH HALF OF PRESEN AND BI DANS TERM SO IN THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE BIDAN ADMINISTRATION LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE BEING TURNED AWAY AT THE BORDER BUT AT THE SAME TIME IN CREDIBLY LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE WERE BEING ALLOWED IN MOSTLY VINISUELLENS AND CUBANS THE CARAGUONES SOME HATIONS MORE THAN A MILLION MIGRANS WERE ALLOWED INTO THE US IN TWO YEARS SO WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TAKE MENISUELLA FOR EXAMPLE THE UES DIDN'T HAVE GOOD DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIPS WIT TEN NESUELLA SO WE COULDN'T FLIVE MINISUELLENS BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY WHEN THEY SHOWED UP AT THE BORDER AND MEXICO DIDN'T WANT THEM WAITING ON THEIR SIDE WHICH MEANT THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION WAS STUCK THEY HAD TO VIGUR OUT WHAT TO DO AND THE SOLUSION THEY CAME UP WITH FOR VINISUELLA AND ALL THESE COUNTRIES WIS TEMPORARY ALL THE EMIGRANTS THEY CAME IN THE MORE THAN A MILLION MOST OR HERE IN TEMPORARY PERMITS OF FICIALLY ALLOWED TO STAY FOR A WHILE TILL THINGS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY SCHOOL DOWN AT FIRST THIS WAS CAN HAVE BEEN AT HAWK THING THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION DID A BID UNDER THE RAT ARE JUST TO RELIEVE PRESSURE AT THE BORDER THERE HAD BEEN DANGEROUS OVER CROWDING AT BORDER PARTRAL STATIONS LATER THIS BECAME A MORE OFFICIAL PROGRAM THE PROUDLY POINT TO AS PROOF THAT THEY STAND UP FOR HUMINITARIAN IDEALS BUT ONE OF THE OFFICIALS I TALK TO POINTED OUT TEMPORARY STATUS CAN FUNNEL A LOT OF PEOPLE AWAY FROM GETTING ASYLUM WHICH IS PERMANENT WHATEVER THEIR INTENTIONS BY JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION HAD MAD TWO MAN PARALLEL TRACTS FOR IMIGRANTS TONS OF PEOPLE COMING IN WITH TEMPORARY STATUSES TONS OF OTHERS KEPT OUT BY TITLE FORTY TWO AND THAT'S ONE THE SEDY S ANNOUNCE THE PUBLIC HEALT CRISIS WAS OFFICIALLY OVER TITLE FORTY TWO HAD TO END WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR THESE YUASIIAS WORKERS RIGHT TIS WHAT THEY BEEN WAITING FOR AS THEY SIT IN THEIR OFFICES THEY WONDER WHAT THE PLAN IS HOW THEIR SIPPLES TO HANDLE WHAT MAY BE LARGE NUMBERS OF NEW ASYLUM APPLICANTS THE LAST DAY OF TITLE FORTY TWO KEEPS LOOMING CLOSER AND CLOSER AND THESE WORKERS ARE HEARING NOTHING THEN SOME RUMBLINGS AD THEN WHEN I HEARD THAT THERE WERE IN A DROP ON TE RULE I WAS LIKE OF COURSE THEY ARE THE NEW RULES SPELLED OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW THE BID AN ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO RUN ASYLUM AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER FOR NOW AN ORIGINAL POLICY OF THEIR OWN TO HANDLE THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE THEY EXPECTED WOUL CROSS THE BORDER ONE'S TITLE FORTY TWO ENDED THE RULE IS CALLED C L P WHICH STANDS FOR CIR CONVENTION OF LAWFUL PATHWAYS THE RULE WAS NOT JUST ANY RULE IT'S LIKE A SWISS ARMY NIGHT MANY DIFFERENT RULES ALL ROLLED INTO ON BUT THE PART THAT JUED OUT TO THESE UASIAAS WORKERS THE MOS IS THAT UNDER THE RULE IN ORDER TO EVEN APPLY FOR ASYLUM YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU ALREADYO APPLIED FOR ASYLUM AND GOT DENIED IN AT LEAST ONE COUNTRY YOU'VE PASS THROUGH BEFORE GETTING TO THE UES SO HAVE YOU CAME UP FROM SOUTH AMERICA YOU WENT THOR PANAMA THEN COSTRECA THEN NICARAGUA THEN HONDURAS THEN ELL SAW THE DOR THEN GUATAMALA THEN MEXICO YOU WOULD HAVE TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM AND BE DENIED IN AT LEAST ONE OF THOUGS IF YOU DON'T HAVE PROOF OF THIS YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ASYLUM HEAR DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU'RE FLEINGING YOUR HOME COUNTRY YOUR GOVERNMENT COULD BE ACT IVE WE TRYING TO KILL YOU AN YOUR FAMILY BECAUSE YOU'ARE POLITICAL ACTAVUS CLEAR CUT ASYLUM CLAM NOT RELEVANT ANY MORE YOU BASICALLY WON'T GET ASYLUM IN THE US BECAUSE THESE OTHER COUNTRIES DIDN'T REJECT YOU FIRST THEY OU AS C I S WORKERS I TALK TO OR FLOORED BY THIS THEY WERE LIKE WELL  THAT'S PASICALLY SOMETHING PRECEDENT TRUMP TRY TO PU IN PLACE BUT THE CORT STRUCK IT DOWN QUICKLY SAID IT WAS A LEGAL AND NOW HERE WAS PRESET IN BITED BRINGING IT BACK OR SOMETHING THAT LOOKED A LOT LIKE IT IT WAS MIND BLOWING IT'S THE SAME YET THE ATHER TWIKTED AROUND THE CORNERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAD TO WORK ON WRITING THAT RULE I MEAN JES LIKE I CAN EVEN IMAGINE TO BE THE ONE WHO IS TOLD HE ARE WE DID THAT RULE WHAN WE KNOW THAT IT'S LEGAL BUT LET'S TRY THIS ONE NOW THIS SIS PRE CLEARLY UNLAWFUL AT THIS POINT GEORGE STICKS OUT A THICK BOOK VERY OFFICIAL LOOKING IT'S A BOUND COPY OF THE EMIGRATION AN NATIONALITY ACT HE JUST HAPPENED TO HAPE AROUND THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AS ONE DOES I MUNLES SHEUS REBE ASYLUM STATUE ANY ALIEN WHO'S PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES OR WHO ARRIVES IN THE UNITED STATES WETHER OR BASICALLY THIS SAYS ANY ONE WHO ARRIVES HERE IN ANY WAY LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY CAN APPLY FOR ASYLUM AND SO WHIT CIRCOMVENTION OF LAWFUL PATHWAYSAS IS YES SUREY YOU CAN YOU CAN APPLY BUT WERE AN ASAY YOUR NOUT I REACHED OUT TO ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WHO OVER SEA SEAL PEE ASSISTANTE SECRETARY FOR EMIGRATION AND BORDER POLICY LAST NUNIA'S NETTHAL I ASKED HIM HOW SEAL PE IS DIFFERENT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMPS ASYLUM BAN WHICH HAD BEEN RULED A LEGAL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION A PROCH TO THIS OSE TO INPOS ACATEGORICAL MAN ON ASYLUM AT THE LAND BORDER HE'S SAYING THERE BAND WAS CATAGORIGON IT APPLY TO EVERY ONES NO EXCEPTIONS A SO WERE NOT DENYING ASYLUM CATEGORICALLY TO ANYBODY THAT THE LANDBORDER AND THAT'S JUST A FACT N SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR AUDIENCE  TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS A SENTSIALLY CREA WE WE CALLA REBUTABLE PRESUMPTION AND THAT'S IMORTANT BECAUSE IT IS IN FACT  REBUTABLE AND THAT MEANS OT PEOPLE A CROSS BETWEEN THE PORCOF VENTRY AND HAVE A COMPELLING REASON WHY THEY NEEDED TO DO THAT CAN REBUT THE PRESUMTION WERESEE MANY PEOPL DO THAT IN PRACTICE I REBUTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT MEANS ZEAL P STARTS OFF ASSUMING YOU ARE INNELIGIBLE FOR ASYLUM BUT DON'T WORRY YOU CAN PROVE IT WRONG YOU CAN REBUT LIKE IMMEDIATELY WRITE THERE ON THE SPOT WHEN YOU TALK TO AN ASYLUM OFFICER PROVE IT WRONG AND THEN PUF IT'S GONE DOESN'T OBLIGE YOU ANY MORE THERE'S A LIST OF WAYS TO REBUT THE RULE FIRST IT DOESN'T APPLY TO UNACCOMPANIED MINERS OR IF YOU'RE SICK AND YOU NEED MEDICAL CARE THAT'S AN EXCEPTION OR IF YOU'RE BEING TRAFFIC ANOTHER THING VENDIGATES THE RULE OR IF YOU'RE IN IMINENT DANGER IF SOME ONE IS ACTIVELY TRYING TO KILL YOU THERE AT THE BORDER THAT'S AN EXCEPTION FOR QUOTE EXTREME AND IMINENT THREAT TO LIFE FOR SAFETY BHICH ALL SONE'S REASONABLE ENOUGH BUT THE OFFICERS I SPOKE WITH AND PEOPLE TI TALK TO WHO WORK WITH MIGRANCS ALONG THE BORDER THEY A'LL SAY IT'S REALLY REALLY RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT TO GET ONE OF THESE EXCEPTIONS AR RE BUTTLES AN ATTORNEY I TALK TO FROM THE TEXA CIVIL WRITES PROJECT  THAT SHE'S KNOWN OF CASES WHERE THE MEDICAL EMERGENCY WRE BUTTLE IS SO HARD TO GET IT TAKES SO LONG THE MIGRANTS HAVE GOTTEN SICKER AND SICKER AND HAVE DIED WAITING FOR IT MARK SAYS THAT WHEN HE'S INTERVIEWING ASYLUM SEEKERS AN TRYING TO APPLY THESE SEAL PE RULES HE DOESN'T LIKE WHERE IT LEADS HIM AND WHO HE ANDS UP REJECTING THE CONSEQUENCES AF GETTING THINGS WRONG THE ST AKES ARE EXTREMELY HAT WHEN YOU GET IT WRONG PEOPLE WILL DIE AND IT'S NOT U PURBALY THA STOPING HYSTERICAL THAT IS I FACT IT IS LIFE FOR DEATH DECISIONS EVERY SAY ONE OF THEM YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THEM WRONG AND WHAT SEA P DOES IS IT FORCES YOU TO MAKE IN CORRECT DECISIONS AN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY THE LATEST NUMBERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT TELL US THAT ONLY SIXTEEN PER CENT OF ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO WERE CAUGHT CROSSING THE BORDER WE'RE ABLE TO PROVE THEY QUALIFIED FOR ONE OF THE SEAL P EXCEPTIONS OR REBUTTLES WHICH MEANS EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVE IT THEY COULD BE DEPORT ID MANY YOU AS I AS WORKERS COMPLAINE TO LEADERSHIP ABOUT THIS FROM THE START THAT'S WHY THEY HATED SEAL P THE RESPONSE ACCORDING TO GEORGE Y KNOW SOME OF YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH THIS RONE IT MAY MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BOV  ON THIS IS A JAP AND THEN THE SAT HE CANN'T QUIT BUT THEY REALLY DON'T CARE THEY REALLY IT THAT THE REALLY CHANNELING THEIR IN ER MAR MORTS AND DON'T LET THE DORNON IT YOU WERE THE DOG SHOUN O DITION AT THE END OF THE DAYT THEY'RE NOT INTERESTIN YOU MRAL OR LEGAL OBJECTIONS SHUT THE FOCK UP PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN THO WHICH OURE TOLD  HET WH  I THINK OF THE ADMINISTRATION WERE TELLING THE STORY OF SEAL P THEY WOULDN'T START WITH THE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ASYLUM AT THE BORDER THEY PROBABLY EMPHASIS A DIFFERENT PART OF THE RULE IT'S A WHOLE NEW WAY THERE ENTICING PEOPLE TO CROSS AT THE OFFICIAL BORDER STATIONS IN AN ORDERLY WAY INSTEAD OF SOMETHING MORE DANGEROUS LIKE WAITING ACROSS A RIVER ORE WALKING THROUGH THE DESERT IT'S AN AP YES THEY HAVE AN AP IT'S CALLED C B P ONE AND THEY GOVERNMENT HAS BIG HOPE FOR IT WHEN THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION ROLLED OUT SEAL P THEY ANNOUNCE THAT THIS AP WAS THE WAY EVERY ONE IN THE SOUTHERN BORDER SHOULD APPLY FOR ASYLUM THIS WAS GOIN TO BE THE NEW SYSTEM YOU CAN GET AN APPOINTMENT TO ENTER THE U S AND IT IS SIGNS YOU A PORT OF ENTRY TO SHOW UP TO AT A SPECIFIC TIME LIKE COME TO MATHAMOTOS ON OCTOBER THIRTIETH AT SIX P M AND AS AN INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO USE THE AP IF YOU DOWNLOAD IT AND USE IT AND YOU COME IN AND ASK FOR ASYLUM ALL THE OTHER SEAL P RULES THAT KEEP PEOPLE OUT THEY DON'T APPLY TO YOU LIKE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU ASK FOR ASYLUM IN OTHER COUNTRIES BEFORE YOU GOT HERE YOU DON'T NEED TO BE IN A MEDICAL EMERGENCY YOU R HAVE SOMEONE CHASING YOU THREATENING YOUR LIFE IT'S LIKE A GOLDEN TICKET USE THE AP APPLY FOR SYLUM PERIOD AND I KNOW HOW BONKERS THIS SOUNDS ON THE ONE HAND PRESEDENT BIDING CREATED THIS WE AR TRUMPBE POLICY THAT MAKES IT PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN ASK FOR ASYLUM IN SOME WAYS LUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU CAN SIDE STEP ALL OF THAT AND JUST COME INTO THE UNITED STATES IF YOU HAVE A PHONE AND CAN DOW LODANAP TTHIS HAS BINISCRIBE OS THE CARROT AND STICK APPROACH THEY WENT TO REWARD PEOPLE FOR USING THE SEE BE P ONE AP AND COMING IN THROUGH OFFICIAL PORTS OF ENTRY AND THEY WANT TO PENALIZE EVERYONE ELSE AND HAVING ANAP DOES SEEM SMART MIGRANTS ALL HAVE PHONES THEY OUSAPS ALL THE TIME BUT I'M SURE THE S NEXT PART WILL NOT SURPRISE YOU THE AP DIDN'T WORK SO WEL FROM THE VERY START OF SEAL P THIS PAST MAY IT WENT OFF THE RAILS FIRST OF ALL THEYE WERE NOT A LOT OF APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY A DAY FOR THE WHOLE BORDER SO MIGRANTS WOULD WAIT FOR THE APPOINTMENTS TO OPEN UP TRY TO GET ONE AND THE AP WOULD CRASH THERE WARE ERROR MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM MAKING APPOINTMENTS LIKE ONE THAT JUST SAID FRAUD THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY ONE REVIEW OF THE APTOST READS THIS AP IS CRAP THOUGH HALF THE REVIEW SEEM TO BE RIGHT WING TROLES POSTING THINGS LIKE OPEN DOOR POLICY THANKS BRANDON OR COME ON IN FARROVIA P SDS FOR ALL THE DRUG SMUGGLING HUMAN TRAFFICING CRIMINALS THAT NEET IN NOU STOMPING GROUND WHEN THE AP DID WORK THERE WERE THE WAYTIMES A WOMEN WHO WORKS AT A SHELTER AND RENOSA TOLD ME SHE TALK TO A FAMILY THAT HAD BEEN WAITING FOR FOUR MONTHS FOR THEIR APPOINTMENT SAME WITH MATHEMORTOS ANDTIHUANUM THE PROBLEM WITH WAITING BESIDES THAT IT SUCKS TO WAIT IS TAT THE CAR TELLS AR OUT THE BORDER LOOKING TO ROBIN KIDNAP ASYLUMS SEEKER O ER ASTUCK THERE SO MANY PEOPLE JUST MAKE A RUN FOR IT WITHOUT THEIR GOLDEN TICKET THEY CROSS THE BORDER ANYWHERE THEY CAN MARK LAID OUT FOR ME PRETTY TYPICAL CASE THAT HE SAYS HE GETS OFTEN FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE HANGING OUT MEXICO YOU'R PLANNING ON GETTING YOURS SEEBE P ONE APPOINTMENT BUT THEY GO SNAPPED UP EVERY DAY SO YOU'RE WAITING ROUND AND THEN IN THE MONTHS THAT YOU'RE WAITING IN MOT MORE ELS WHERE OR ELSE YOU GET KIN THAT HOL FORMANSOM THEY MAY CALLS TO YOUR SAMILY MEMBERS USING YOURSELF ON ASKING FOR HOWER MUCH MONEY OTHERWISE I CAN KILL YOU YOU FAMILY SCROUNGES UP WHATEVER THEY GET TO PAY THEM THEY PAY THEM YOU GET RELEASE TO ET Y YOU DUMPED OFP ON THE SIDE THE ROAD SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW HOW NO MONEY BECAUSE THEY'VE ROBBED YOU THEY TAKEEN ALL YOUR TRAVEL DOCUMENTS THIF THEY CAN UOU KOW EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAD WITH YOU SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPORT YOURSELF IN THIS BORDER TOWN WHILE YOU WAIT TO GET A SEEBE P ONE APPOINTMENT ON THE FOND THAT YOU LONGER HAV SO YOU DSAT I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE I GOT ACROSS IN TH UNITED STATES MARK ASK ME DID I THINK THAT MIGRAN WAS AN EXTREME DANGER ENOUGH TO GET A REBUTTLE TO THE SEAL PEA RULES AND BE ALLOWED TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM IT SOUNDS LIKE A WELL NO THAT'S NOT HOW WORKS THAT PERSON IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THATERYBUTTLE BECAUSE YOU HALF TO DEMONSTRATE TH YOUR LIFE OR SAFETY WAS IN IMININ DANGER AT THAT EXACT MOMENT WHEN YOU CROSS INTO THE UNITED STATES SO UNLESS THAT CARTEL EOR WHOEVER KIN AP TO YOU IS NIPPING ON YOUR SHEELS AS YOU DIVE IN THE WATER YOU ARE NOT ELGIBLE FOR THATERYBOTTLE THIS IS THAT YOU ASIIIAS WORKER I WILL CALL JOANA SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS JOB FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW IT SORTE LIKE THIS WHOLE COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL IDEA THAT YO YOU'VE TO BE ACTUALLY LIKE RUNNING THROUGH THE DESERT AND LIKE YOU DON'T TRY TO WAGE YOUR WAY ACROSS THE REO GRAND WHILE BULLETS ARE FLYING OVER YOUR HEAD RAG I MEAN IS IS IF YOU LIKE THESE LAWS AND IDEAS ARE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE WATCHED WAY TOO MANY WORLD WORK TOO MOVIES FOR LIKE TOMITE EPISES OF NARCOS OR SEME YE YET TOO MANY HEVISENCE OF NARCO TER LIKE I DON'T KNOW BUT LIKE THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT HOW WORKS  STEPPING BACK AND LOOKING UP THE BIG PICTURE MOST OF THE PEOPLE ENTERING FROM OUR SOUTHERN BORDER ARE NOT YOU SEEM THE SEEP P ONE AP ENOCTOBER IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO GOT COPY TO EEN PORTS OF VENTRY OFERSAS ABOUT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND WHO USE THE AP WHICH MEANS MOST PEOPLE FACE THE RESTRICTIVE RULES THAT MAKE IT SO HARD TO ASK FOR ASYLUM THEY YOU AS SEIAS OFFICIALS THEY SPOKE TO SAID UNDER PRESIDEN BITEN THE WAY SELPE IS WRITTEN IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE ALL THESE WAS YOU CAN STILL APPLY FOR ASYLM BUT IN PRACTICE IT'S JUST AS BAD AS IT WAS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUM BECAUSE SEAL P DENI SO MANY PEOPLE THE CHANCE AT ASYLUM AT ALL I ASKED ASISTANT SECRETARY NUNIOUS NETTO IF PRESEDENT BINES POLICY IS JUST AS RESTRICTIVE AS PRESDENT TRUMPS WHAT WE ARE DUING IS THEY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AN BALANCE TO PROACHE TO THE CITRY THAT AGAIN INCLUDES AN UNPRESIDENTED EXTENSION INLAWFUL POKWARS N PROSCESSIES WOR PEOPLE TO CON TO THE COUNTRY WHILAT THISIN ON PUT SON COMMON SENSE OR O CONSTRAINTS ON O THE ABILITYOCLIMSION AT THE BORDER FOR INDIVIDUALS AT THE LANDBORDER BETWEEN PORTSENT WO DON'T HAVE A COMPELLING REASON WANITY TO CROSS  UN LOWF WE BETWEEN HEIRPORTSENT BUT IN PRACTICE WHAT WERE HEARING ON THE GROUND IS THAT PEOPLE WHO THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY HARD TO PROVE THE EXCEPTIONS AND REBUTTLES THAT PEOPLE THAT TRY TO PROVE AN EXCEPTION AR REBUTTLE THAT HAS TO DO WITH MEDICAL EMERGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DIED WAITING FOR SUCH AN EXCEPTION AR REBUTTLE AND DOESN'T IT IN EFFECT AT THE END DOESN'T IT TO SQUALIFY A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM EVEN ASKING FOR ASYLUM JUST REALY REAMSES IRY N OTE REASONA ON THE RECORD HERE AT THAT POINT ASSISTANTS SECRETARY NUNIOUS NETTOS PRESS PERSEN INTERRUPTED US THEY' AGREE TO ANSWER ONLY ONE QUESTION ABOUT SEAL P ON THE RECORD I SAW THIS IS A NORMAL FOLLOW UP TO CLARIFY THEY DISAGREED THEY SAID THEY WERE LIMITED IN WHAT THEY COULD SAY BECAUSE OF ON GOING LAW SUITS ABOUT THE RULE THE KEEP PHRASE IN WHAT HE SAID WAS A BALANCED T APPROACH THEADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE TALKTO SAY THAT THIS MISHMASH OF NEW RULES AND EXCEPTIONS TO THOSE RULES AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAVE DESCRIBED THEY SAY WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER YOU'LL SEE THEM TRYING TO BALANCE THE HUMINITARIAN PRINCEIPLES THEY SAY THEY HOLD DEAR WUT THE FACT THAT THEY NEED TO WEAD OUT DUBIOUS ASYLUM CLAIMS I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE'S A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS SO MANY PEOPLE ARRIVING AT THE BORTER AND A BACK LOGUE OF NEARLY THREE MILLION EMIGRATION CASES ALREADY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOWING UP EACH WEEK AND THEIRES SCARED OF LOOKING SOFT ON IMIGRATION TUT THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE ANTY EMIGRANT THEY DON'T THINK OF THEMSELVES AS ANTY EMIGRANT SO THEY ENDED UP WITH THIS CONTRADICTORY HODGE PADCH LETTING IN OVER A MILLION PEOPLE FOR HUMINITARIAN RESONS BUT THAT'S JUST TEMPORARY RELOCATION OR SETTING UP SEAL P RULES THET ARE BOTH DEEPLY RESTRICTIVE AND SURPRISINGLY UNRESTRICTED OF COURSE IT'S AMASS TSEAL P IS CURENLY BEING CHALLENGED IN COURT IN TWO SEPARATE FEDERAL CASES THE ASEAL USE TOING THE BID AN ADMINISTRATION IN BO SAYING THAT SEALPE MAKES THE TWO HARD FOR PEOPLE TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW THE ASYLUM OFFICERS UNION HAS FILED TWO AMECAS PREEVS ONE FOR EACH OF THE LAW SUITS SAYING THEY AGREE THEY REPEROSENT ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ASYLUM OFFICERS ASSISTANT SECRETARY NUNIAS NETTO TOLD ME THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONFIDENT THE RULE IS LEGLE THE  THERE IS ONE PHRASE AT ONE OF THE OFFICERS JOANNA USED THAT STUCK WITH ME SHE SAID THE OVERTUN WINDOW HAS SHIFTED WHICH MEANS THE WINDOW OF POLITICAL ACCEPTABILITY HAS CHANGED THE GULPOST HAVE MOVED BECAUSE OF TRUMP STRATEGY ON ASYLUM WHERE THE GOAL ACCORDING TO JOANNA WAS TO KILL THE ASYLUM PROGRAM ALLOW NO ONE IN GIVE NO PROTECTION AND WHEN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CREATED SE L P TJOANNA THINKS THEY COSIGNED ON THE IDEA OF LET'S JUST NOT ANY MORE JUST WITH A DIFFERENT TONE LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE NOW THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THE BIDED ADMINISTRATION IN ACTION IN ASYLUM WHAT WHAT THINGSTER YOU LIKE YES HIS IS THEY ACTUALLY AVE MADE SOME CHANGES HERES WHERE IT'S DIFFERENT AND HERE IS WHERE IT'S THE SAME AS HOW IT WASN'TER TRUMP ER WELL THEY DON'T PULL BABIES AWAY FROM MOTHERS ARMS SO I GESS YOU GET A SICKER ARE I COOKY YE FOR YOU THEY TALK ABOUT IT DIFFERENT LAY AH THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT DEMICRATS DON'T CALL COUNTRY SHET HALL COUNTRIES THEY JUST THEY TREAT THAT LIKE SHAT HALL COUNTRIES BUT I THINK WHAT THE BIDAN ADMINISTERYTION YOU HAVE A PRETENSE AT PROTECTION THAT THE TRUMP PEOPLE DED AN'TTO THERE'S SOMETHING JUST LIK RIH DO YOU THNK IT'S WORSE THAN IT WESUNDER TRUM I MEAN IT'S VERY BAD AND VERY SIMILAR BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND WHAT YOU MEAN A DIFFERENT KIND SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT IS WORSE SOME ONE WHOSE DIRECT IN DOING SOMETHING BAD SOME ONE WHO DRESSES UP A LITTLE NICER AND PUTS A BETTER FACE ON IT BUT STILL DOES PRETTY MUCH THE SAMETHING I THINK WE'LL LOOK BACK ON THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE BID ADMINISTRATION IN THE FUTURE N IDENTIFY THIS AS AN INFLECTION POINT WHEN WE KIND OF POINT STAP THE PRETENSE OF HAVING AN A SYLUM SYSTEM THAT COMPORTS WIS OUR LEGAL OBLIGATIONSE UNDER INTERNATIONAL AND FEDERAL LAW MAY BE THAT'S THE REAL BY PARTIES AN AGREEMENT AT THIS POINT THIS SYSTEM THAT WE BUILT TO FUNCTION OS THEIR OWN IDEALISTIC CAVALRY TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES BOTH PARTIE SEEM TO HAVE DECIDED THAT WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT ANYMORE IS THAT OF LOOKING AT WHY YOURE COMING TO THE US AND JUDGING THAT ON ITS MERITS NOW WE'LL BLOCK YOU BECAUSE OF HOW YOU CAME TO THE UES WHETHER Y USE TESS TO BE PE ONE UP WHETHER YOU ASK FOR ASILUM FROM COUNTRIES ALONG THE WAY IF YOU ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE THE MOST THEN NEED A RESCUING OUR ASILUM SYSTEM AS IT STANDS TAY NO LONGER SAVING YOM  NATRAMENT IS ANETITE POMAN TO YOU PRESSED IN HELPED US OUT

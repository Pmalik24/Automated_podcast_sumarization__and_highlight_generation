THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT HUBERMAN LABPODCAST PREMIUM SUBSCRIBERS YOU CAN STILL HERE THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES OF TO DAY IS EPISODE AND DETERMINE WHETHER NOT BECOMING A PREMIUM SUBSCRIBER IS FOR YOU WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S GET TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THE FIRST QUESTION ASKS IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET A COLD OR TO GET SICK FROM DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I SUPPOSE A RELATED QUESTION IS SHOULD YOU EVEN DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IF YOU HAVE A SNIFELE A COLD OR A FLUE I GET THAT QUESTION ALL THE TIME AS WELL S LL ANSWER BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND I WILL ALSO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE MUNE ENHANCING EFFECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ANSWER THE SPECIFIC QUESTION ASKED HERE RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET A COLD OR TO GET SICK FROM DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WELL ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR MORE THAN SAY FIVE OR SIX MINUTES AT ONE STRETCH PROBABLY NOT DIRECTLY FROM THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I MENTION THAT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE DOING ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT A MINUTE TO THREE MINUTE SOMETIMES FIVE OR SIX MINUTES AND MAYBE FOR THOSE OF YOU THEYARE REALLY PUSHING IT TEN MINUTES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND MOST OFTEN AFTER DOING THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PEOPLE ARE EITHERE ETTING CLOTHED OR THE'R GTTING INTO A SAUNA OR THE'RE TAKING A HOT SHOWER AND THEN GETTING CLOTHED AND HEADING OFF INTO THEIR DAY OR OFF TO SLEEP DEPENING ON WHAT TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT YOU HAPPEN TO DO YOUR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT IF YOU WARM UP AFTER A RELATIVELY BRIEF MEANING ONE MINUTE TO LET'S EXTEND OUT TO TEN MINUTES TEN MINUTE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ALTHOUGH I REALLY WANT ACCAUTIONED PEOPLE TO NOT DO TEN MINUTE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE RIGHT OFF THE BAT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT DON'T JUMP RIGHT UP TO THAT A LONG EXPOSURE TO COLD WATER START WITH SHORTER EXPOSURES BUT IF YOU'RE DOING THAT ONE TO TEN MINUTE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND THEYUARE GETTING WARM AFTERWARDS AND HEADING ABOUT YOUR DAY I CAN'T SEE HOW THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ITSELF WOULD ENHANCE YOUR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO GETTING SICK THAT SAID WE KNOW FROM AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE LOOKED AT COLD VIROUS TRANSMISSION AND OTHER FORMS OF VIRAL AND BACTERIAL TRANSMISSION THAT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN DOES IMPACT YOUR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO COLDS AND OTHER TYPES OF VIRUSES AND TO BACTERIAL INFECTIONS IN THE FOLLOWING WAY THERE'VE BEEN CONTROLED STUDIES IN WHICH PEOPLE GO INTO LABORATORIES WHOSE LABORATORIES HAVE ROOMS WHICH THEY CAN VERY TIGHTLY CONTROLD E HUMIDITY SOMESEMCILY THE WATER CONTENT IN THE AIR AS WELL AS THE TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL MASS OF THOSE DATA WE CAN SAY A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC THINGS AND CAN BULLET POINT FASHION FIRST OFF COLD DRY AIR DOES SEEM TO INCREASE OUR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO VIRAL AND BACKTURIAL INFECTIONS BECAUSE WHETHER NOT YOUR MOUTH BREATHER OR NOSEBREATHER AND BY THE WAY I SUGGEST EVERYONE BE A NOSEBREATHER UNLESS YOU'R EXERCISING HARD ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE TO BREATH THROUGH YOUR MOUTH FOR YOUR TALKING OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT BUT IF YOU'RE A NOSEBRATHER OR MOUTH BREATHER OR BOTH VIRUSES AND BACTURIA ENTER THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND MOUTH SOMETIMES THROUGH YOUR EYES BUT YOUR NOSE AND MOUTH ARE GONG TO BE THE MAINSIDES OF ENTRY AND YOUR MAIN BARRIERS TO VIRAL IND BACTURIAL INFECTIONS IN FACT ONE OF THE WAYS YOU ARE CONSTANTLY FIGHTING OFF BACTURIAL AN VIRAL INFECTIONS THAT YOURE EXPOSED TO ALL THE TIME IS BY WAY OF THOSE VIRUSES AND BACTURY GETTING TRAPPED IN THE MUCUS LINING OF YOUR NOSE OR YOUR MOUTH MOST NOTABLY IN THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT SO IF YOU SPEND TIME IN COLD DRY ENVIRONMENTS THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR THAT MUCOSAL LINING TO BE THINNER THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR THAT MUCOSAL LINING TO NOT BE AS ROBUST IN GENERAL WHEN I SAY ROBUST WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IF YOUR MOUTH BREATHING FOR INSTANCE IN A COLD DRY ENVIRONMENT I'M THINKING IM FROM THE TIME I SPENT IN A CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS IN WINTER AT THE TEA STATION YOU KNOW F YOUR I'M JUST IMAGING MYSELF CAUSE IT SO DARN COLD BACK THERE YOU BREATHING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH OR HAVING GOT FOR RUN AND YOUR MOUTH ISN'T COVERED OR EVEN IF YOU'RE DELIBERATELY NASAL BREATHING YOU ARE DRING OUT YOUR NASAL PASSAGES AND MAKING THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTIONS DOES THAT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT IN COL DRY AIR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET AN INFECTION NOW OF COURSE IT DOESN'T BUT TO RELATE THIS BACK TO THE QUESTION WE HAVE BEFORE THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA POINTING TO THE FACT THAT MORE HUMID WARM ENVIRONMENTS ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR MUCOSAL LINING AND THE GENERAL UPPER RESPIRATORY AREA MORE I DON'T WAT SAY IMMUNE CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CONFLATE THAT WORD WITH THE OTHER MEANING OF AMMUNE IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT MORE ROBUST AGAINST BACTERIAL AND VIRAL INFECTIONS AY SO IF YOU GET INTO A COLD SHOWER OR A COLD PLUNGE OR A COLD OCEAN OR A COLD LAKE AND THEN YOU GET OUT IN YOU'RE OUT THERE NOW SHIVERING AND SHAKING TRYING TO BOOSTEUR METABOLISM WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE DOING IT FOR AND IT'S COLD DRY AIR AND ESPECIALLY IF YOUR MOUTH BREATHING IN THAT COLD DRY AIR YES I COULD SEE HOW THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF GETTING A COLD OR OTHER TYPE OF INFECTION BUT THERE'S NOTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ITSELF THAT CAN INDUCE A COLD OR OTHER TYPE OF INFECTION ASSUMING THAT THE WATER IS CLEAN RIGHT WHERE NOT TIME OUT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS OF CUTS ON THE SKIN ET CETERA ORE TALKING ABOUT COLD AND OTHER FORMS OF BEING SICK NAMELY UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS NOW WITH THAT SAID BI OFTEN GET ASKED WHETHER NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE A LITTLE SNIFFLE THEIR FEELING ILL RUN DOWN OR PERHAPS A LOT RUN DOWN SHOULD THEY DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND WHAT'S A LITTLE TRICKY TO GIVE A ONE SIZES FITS ALL ANSWER BUT I THINK WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT IF YOU ARE FEELING MALAZS IF YOU'RE FEELING LIKE YOU HAVE TO REST YOU'RE TIRED YOU'RE NOT FEELING GOOD BECAUSE OF A COLD OR BECAUSE OF A FLUE OR BECAUSE OF A BACTERIAL INFECTION AY I'M NOT SAYING JUST FEELING NOT GOOD I'M SAYING FEELING NOT GOOD DUE TO A COLD OR OTHER FORM OF VIRUS OR BACTERIAL INFECTION THEN I WOULD SAY STAY OUT OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE DON'T USE IT NOW WHY WOULD I SAY THAT GIVEN THE DATILL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES SHOWING THAT REGULAR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IF DONE CORRECTLY CAN IN FACT INCREASE AMMUNE SYSTEM MARKERS AND PERHAPS EVEN O MAKE YOU MUCH MORE ROBUST TO COMBATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFECTION THROUGH THE RELEASE OF A DRENNOLINE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT ALL THAT LOOKS LIKE IN A MOMENT INTERMS OF PROTOCOLS IN SOME OF THE SCIENCE BUT TO JUST BE VERY CLEAR AND VERY DIRECT IF YOU'RE SICK STAY OUT OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THERE I WOULD INSTEAD RECOMMEND WARMER HOT BATHS WARMER HOT SHOWERS THE SANA ET CETERA BUT I ALSO WOULD CAUTION THAT IF YOU ARE GETTING INTUSANAS THAT ARE TOO HOT YOU KNOWSANAS THEYARE SO HOT THAT IT'S STRESSFUL FOR YOU AND AGAIN THE LOT OF PEOPLE USE DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE BECAUSE OF THE STRESSES INDUCES THEIRE DOING IM SOME HEAT INDUCE FOR INSTANCE HEAT SHOCK PROTENES AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF INCREASING HEARTWRAHTE THAT'S A DIFFERENTE SORT OF THING THAT'S HARD STRESSFUL IN ORDER TO GENERATE AN ADAPTATION I DON'T RECOMMEND DOING THAT IN FACT I DON'T RECOMMEND DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE EXERCISE OR DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE IF YOU'RE FEELING REALLY NOT WELL NOW IF YOU'RE FEELING JUST A LITTLE BIT NOT WHILE YOU'RE FEELING A LITTLE BIT RUN DOWN LITTLE BIT OF SNIFFLE WE'LL BIT OF MALASE WELL THEN IT'S KIND OF AN EDGE CASE WHERE WE COULD SAY ARE I YOU KNOW IT JUST TICK A HOT SHOWER AND GO TO SLEEP THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST ADVICE I THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED ADVICE BUT IF YOU ARE DETERMINED TO DO YOUR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ANYWAY THEN I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY GET WARM OR TAKE A HOT SHOWER AFTERWARDS HOT BATH OR A HOT SANA BUT NOT TOO HT THAT IT'S STRESSFUL OF COURSE AND KEEP IN MIND THAT ONE OF THE VARIABLES THAT'S BEEN MEASURED QUITE A LOT IN LABORATORY STUDIES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS THE INCREASE IN A MUNE SYSTEM MARKERS SO I'LL PROVIDE A FEW LINKS TO SOME OF THESE STUDIES I'M ALTHOUGH NOWADAYS THERE ARE MANY MANY OF THEM BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE KIN INCREASE THE RELEASE AND THE PRODUCTION OF DIFFERENT MMUNE MOLECULES IN AMMUNE CELLS ONE SLIGHTLY OLDER STUDY BUT NONE THE LESS A GOOD STUDY THAT HAS RELEVANTS HERE IS ENTITLED A MUNE SYSTEM OF COLD EXPOSED AND COLD ADAPTED HUMANS I KEEP IN MIND THAT THE STUDY IS A LITTLE BIT EXTREME AND THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT I GESS TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT OFTENTIMES IN ORDER TO COTEQSEA AN EFFECT IN A STUDY SCIENTISTS WILL USE CONDITIONS THAT ARE PRETTY EXTREME COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP OFTENTIMES YOU'LL SEE A DOSE RESPONSE TO BUT T'S A LITTLE BUT TRICKER TO DO WITH A HUMAN STUDIES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IT CAN BE DONE BUT NOT TOO COMMON BUT HERE THEY USED A PRETTY WHAT I WECALL EXTREME STIMULUS IT WAS EXPOSING PEOPLE TO FOURTEEN DEGREE CELSIEUS WATER SO THAT'S FIFTY SEVEN POINT TO DEGREES FARENHEIT WHICH ISN'T THAT COLD IT'S AVS O COOL I WATS A VERY COOL WATER BUT NOT WHET YOU MIGHT CONSIDER COLD DEPENDING ON HOW WELL YOU TOLERATE COLD AND THAT WILL VARY OF COURSE BUT THEY HAD PEOPLE EXPOSED TO THAT FOR AN HOUR WHICH THE PRETTY LONG TIME YOU' MOST PEOPLE AS I MENTION ARE USING COLDER TEMPERATURES OF DELIERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO EVEN YOU KNOW HIGH THIRDEASE LOW FORTEASE MAYBE UPPER FORTIES FOR ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO TEN MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW CONDITIONED THEY ARE AND AGAIN DON'T JUST JUMP INTO TEN MINUTES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PLEASE OM ET YOU KNOW THIRTY FIVE DEGREES OR FORTY DEGREES OR EVEN FORTY FIVE DEGREES IF YOU AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSE YOU HAVE TO EASE INTO THESE SORTS OF THINGS OVER TIME AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PROTOCALS FOR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WE HAVE A ZERO COST NEWS LETTER AT HU RUMAN LAPED OCK CALM GO TO THE MENYUGO NEWS LETTER AND YOU CAN FIND THAT WE'VE DONE SEVERAL EPISODES ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IN ANY EVENT THIS STUDY AN MUN SYSTEM OF COLD EXPOSING COLD ADAPTED HUMANS AS I MENTION HAD PEOPLE IN FOURTEEN DEGREE CELLSIOUS WATER FOR ONE HOUR AND BASILY WHAT THY FOUND IS THAT ONE EXPOSURE TO COLD DID NOT CHANGE IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IN ANY KIND OF SIGNIFICANT WAY HOWEVER WHAT THEY FOUND WAS IF PEOPLE DID DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE REPEATEDLY OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT SIX WEEKS AND BY REPEATEDLY I MEAN THREE TIMES PER WEEK WHAT THEY FOUND WERE TRENS AND AGAIN TRENS ARE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT TRENS TOWARDS INCREASES IN PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF THINGS LIKE IL SIX INTERLUCAN SIX OR TOTAL NUMBERS OF TEA LEMPHASITES AND TEA HELPER CELLS AND T SUPPRESS OR CELLS AND ACTIVATED TEA AND BE LEMPHASIZE THESE ARE ALL IMMUNE CELLS AND IMMUNE MOLECULES THAT ROUGHLY CORRESPOND TO AN INCREASE IN AMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IF YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE MMUNE SYSTEM I DIDN EPISODE ON A MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTI AN AGAIN YOU CAN FINE THAT AT HUBRUMAN LABEDOUT COMM AN IT SPELLS OUT THE BASIC CELL TYPES OF WHAT'S CALLED THE INNATE AND THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM THIS STUDY WHICH WE WILL LINK TO IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS IS BUT ONE STUDY OF SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES SHOWING THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE IMMUNE SYSTEM MARKERS ESPECIALLY WHEN DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS DONE REPEATEDLY OVER TIME SO THIS CASE THREE TIMES A WEEK OVER A PERIOD OF SIX WEEKS BUT AGAIN I WANT ELITE THESE AREN'T HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS THESE ARE TRENS IN THE DIRECTION OF INCREASED NUMBERS OF IMMUNE CELLS ANEMIUNE MARKERS NOW WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IS HOW THOSE TRENS TRANSLATE TO ACTUAL RESISTANCE TO SPECIFIC CONCENTRATIONS OF SAY COLD VIRUS OR FLUE VIRUS OR ANY OTHER VIRUS OR BACTERIA THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT STUDY TO DO ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AS WELL NOW WE CAN ALL BE SCIENTISTS ABOUT THIS AND SAY WHAT IS IT ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THAT WOULD INCREASE IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND THERE WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THE MOLECULES EPINEFRAN AND NOREPAN EFRN WHICH ARE RELEASED IN BOTH BRAIN AND BODY IN RESPONSE TO COLD WATER EXPOSURE AS WELL AS THINGS LIKE DELIBERATE HYPERVENTILATION THE RELEASE OF NORUPAN EFRAN AND EPIND EFRAN INTO THE BRAIN INBODY IS KNOWN TO HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS RELADE TO THE IMUNE SYSTEM IT CAN BE PRO IMMUNE AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM AND IN THE LONG TERM MEANING IF NOR DRENALIN AND DRENALINE AGAIN THOSE ARE JUST DIFFERENT NAMES FOR NOREPIN FRAN AN EPN EFRN I'M SORRY THOSE THE SAME THING BUT THAT'S WHY USE THEM INTERCHANGEABLY SO THAT YOU DON'T GET CONFUSED IF YU SEE NOR DRENALINE OR NOREPINERAN AS THE SAME THING YOU HEAR EPIN EFRAN OR DRENALINE SAME THING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OR DELIBERATE HYPER VENTILATION WILL INCREASE THOSE MOLECULES NORUPIN EFRAN AN EPIN EFRN AND THEIR INCREASE IS PRO IMMUNE CANCRIGER THE ACTIVATION OF EMMUNE CELLS ENEMUNE MOLECULES THAT CAN MAKE YOU MORE RESISTANT TO CERTAIN FORMS OF INFECTION HOWEVER IF NORUPAN EFRAN AN EPIND ERN ARE ELEVATED CHRONICALLY AND ESPECIALY IF THEY ARE ELEVATED LATE IN THE DAY REPEATEDLY OVER MANY MANY DAYS THAT CAN CAUSE REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBER AND EFFICIENCY OF IMMUNE CELLS IN COMBATING INFECTIONS SO GETTING COLD IN THIS CONTEXT OF WHETHER NOT YOU CAN GET SICK FROM IT SHOULD REALLY BE CONSIDERED MORE AS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SPIKE YOUR DRENALIN AN NOREPINEFERAN AND THERE'S ONE OTHER STUDY THAT WE CAN LOOK TO WHICH IS NOW REALLY A FAMOUS STUDY PUBLISHIN PROCEENS O THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES LOOKING AT SO CALLED WHIMHOFF BREATHING BUT REALLY THAT JUST TRANSLATES TO SYCLICHY PERVENTILATION SO THIS IS INHALING THROUGH HE NOSE ACALLING THROUGH THE MOUTH REPEATEDLY TWENTY FIVE TIMES OR SO IF YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW IS YOU FEEL QUITE WARM AS TO DO WITH SOME THINGS RELATE TO VASIDILATION AS AS TO DO WITH RELEASE OF NOR UP AN EFRN AN EP AND FFEN WE KNOW THAT PATTERN OF DELIBERATE HI PROVENTILATION MUCH LIKE DELIBERTE COLD EXPOSURE DEPLOYS OR RELEASES NOR DRENALIN AND A DRENALINE INTO YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND WE KNOW FROM THIS STUDY ENTITLE VOLUNTARY ACTIVATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND A TENUATION OF THE NATIVE MUNE RESPONSE IN HUMANS SHOWED REALLY NICELY I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE ARE INJECTED WITH ECOLI RAT A BACTERIA TSISHALY END THEY DID THIS THROUGH ENDITOXAN INJECTIONS PEOPLE GOT REALLY SICK THEY GETN FEEL LIKE THE AD THE FLUE THEY VOMIT DIARHOEA GET A FEVER ET CETERA HOWEVER IF THEY DID THE SORTS OF BREATHING THAT I TALKED ABOUT JUST A MOMENT AGO PRIOR TO THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO WARD OFF A LOT OF THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATE WITH THE ENDITOXON INFECTION AND YOU ITS I OKE WILE THEIR R MUNE SYSTEM JUST FIRED UP AND THEY WERE ABLE TO FIGHT IT OFF BUT IT'S TRICKIER THAN THAT ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE RELEASE OF EPANEFRAN AND NOR EPAN EFRAN FROM SYCLICHY PROVENTILATION WHICH IS REALLY WHAT REALLY IS CYCLIC YPEROVENILITION ALSO CALL WHIMHA BREATHING ALSO COTUMO BREATHING ET CETERA THAT ACTUALLY HAD A SUPPRESSIVE ACTION ON CERTAIN ARMS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO AVOID SYMPTOMOLOGY SUCH AS EVER NAUSIA ET CETERA AND WE WOULD IMAGINE THE SAME THING WOULD OCCUR WOITH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE DONE PRIOR TO BACTURIAL INFECTION OR VIRAL EXPOSURE SO IF YOU'RE SENSING THAT I'M SAYING TWO THINGS AT ONCE I AM I'M SAYING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND SYCLICIPREVENTILATION CAN BOTH CAUSE DEPLOYMENT OF MOLECULES SUCH AS EPIN EFFERAN AND NORE UP AN EFFRNT THAT LEAD TO ENHANCED O MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IF DONE REPEATEDLY I'M ALSO SAYING THAT INCREASING YOUR EPIN EFFERAN AN EPERATAN EFFRAN TOO MUCH CAN SUPPRESS YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IN THE STUDY THE PIANAAST STUDY THAT MENTION A MOMENT AGO THAT SUPPRESSION OF THE UMUN RESPONSE WAS ACTALLY ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE AVOIDIT SYMPTOMOLGY BUT THEY WERE STILL INJECTED WITH ENTO TOXENS THEY JUST WEREN'T FIGHTING OFF THE ENTOTOXEN WITH FEVER REMEMBER FEVERIS IN ADAPTATION TO FIGHT INFECTION IS DESIGNED DESENTIALLY TO HEAT UP THE INFECTION AND KILL IT SO WHAT ARE WE TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS HERE ARE WHAT I THINK OR THE KEY TAKE AWAYS ONE IF YOU ARE FEELING GOOD TO GREAT DO YOUR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND PERHAPS DON'T WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT USING YOUR BODY'S NATURAL METABOLISM AND THERMOGENIC ABILITIES TO HEAT BACK UP AFTERWARDS BUT I DON'T SUGGEST ANY ONE EVER ALLOW THEMSELVES TO SAY REALLY COLD AFTER DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR MORE THAN TEN FIFTEEN MENTS OR MAY BE HALF AN HOUR RIGHT GET BUNDLED BACK UP OR PUT ON CLOTHES IF IT'S A NICE HOT SUNNY DAY GET OUT IN THE SUN AND WARM UP GEN TEMPERATURES AND CONDITIONS WILL VARY FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ET CETERA IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING GREATLY FEELING A LITTLE RUN DOWN AND YOU REALLY WANT TO DO YOUR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE DO IT BUT THEN WARM UP REALLY WELL AFTERWARDS MAYBE EN DRINK SOME IN A HOT TEA OR OTHER FLUID AFTERWARDS AS WELL AND IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING GOOD YOUR FEELING MALAYS YOU'R FEELING RUN DOWN DESPITE WHAT YOU READ ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OR SYCLICI PREVENTILATION ALLOWING FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF IMMUNE MOLECULES ARE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF IMMUNCILLES THAT YOU'RE MAKING AVOID ANYTHING THAT'S STRESSFUL OR CHALLENGING WHETHER NOT'S A COLD CHALLENGE A HEAT CHALLENGE OR AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE WHEN YOU'RE FEELING RUN DOWN BECAUSE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS SLOW YOUR CIRCULATION DOWN PROBABLY FIND TO TAKE WALKSER SOMETHING PROVIDE YOU'RE NOT DOUBLED OVER IN BED AND YOU VOMINING I THNGS LIKE THAT YOU'N A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT PROBABLY GOOD TO CIRCULATE YOUR BLOOD BUT IN GENERAL THE ADVICE THAT YOU GET TO REST WHEN YOU'RE SICK AND NOT PUSH YOURSELF THAT'S REALLY GOOD ADVICE BECAUSE YOU WANT ALL OF YOUR BODI'S RESOURCES TO BE DEVOTED TO GETTING OVER THAT INFECTION AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SICKNESS AND SICKNESS BEHAVIOR AND THE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS THAT CAN COMBAT INFECTION CHECK OUT THE EPISODE I DID ON THE IMUNE SYSTEM WE'LL LINK TO IT IN THE SHOW NOTE CAPTIONS BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW WHEN WE HAVE A VIRAL OR BACTERIAL INFECTION A WHOLE SET OF BRAIN CIRCUITS GET ACTIVATED THAT THAT ENCOURAGE US TO BE MORE IN THE FEEDALE POSITION TO MOVE LAST TO BE EYES DOWN TO COYOU KNOW SLUMP DOWN THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVATION OF THESE SO CALLED SICKNESS CIRCUITS THAT ARE REALLY DESIGNE TO HELP YOU HEAL YOURSELT SO I BOTH APOLOGIZE END ONE OF THE COULD SAY SORRY NOT SORRY DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR THE SOMEWHAT NUANCE ANSWER HERE BECAUSE A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE SAYS OH YOU KNOW COLD BOOSYURIMIUN SYSTEM AND YET THAT'S TRUE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IT CAN ALSO TO PLEAT YOURIMIUNE SYSTEM AND LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO FIGHT OFF INFECTIONS UNDER OTHER CONDITIONS AND PERHAPS THE LAST THING TO SAY ABOUT THIS IS THAT I AM A BIG BELIEVER IN USING NASAL BREATHING WHENEVER YOU DON'T HAVE TO BREATH THROUGH YOUR MOUTH SO IF YOU'RE EXERCISEING HARD BY ALL MEANS BREAT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH IF YOU DO MARSHAL AREITS AND IT REQUIRES THAT YOU BREA THROUGHYOUR MOUTH GO HEAD AND DO THAT BUT IF YOU'RE DOINGS SAYS OWN TOO CARDIO LE LEVAL CARDIO OR OU JUST WALKING ALONG IT'S VERY CLEAR BASED ON A GROWING AMOUNT OF DAY TA THE BEING A NASAL BREATHER IS BETTER THAN BEING A MOUTH BREATHER AND THERE AR NUMBER DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE BUT ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL REASONS IS A MAINSIDE OF ENTRY FOR INFECTIONS IS THROUGH THE MOUTH SO KEEP THAT MOUTH SHUT UNLESS YOU NEED TO TALK THANK YOU REJOINING FOR THE BEGINNING OF THIS ASK ME ANYTHING EPISODE TO HEAR THE FULL EPISODE AND TO HEAR FUTURE EPISODES OF THESE ASK ME ANYTHING SESSIONS PLUS TO RECEIVE TRANSCRIPTS OF THEM AND TRANSCRIPTS OF THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST STANDARD CHANNEL AND PREMIUM TOOLS NOT RELEASED ANYWHERE ELSE PLEASE GO TO

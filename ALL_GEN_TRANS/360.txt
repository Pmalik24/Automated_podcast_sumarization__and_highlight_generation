WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LATPONCANS S CO SIENCE SCIENCE PAS TO FR LIF RECENTLY THE HUBERMALABHOSTED A LIVE EVENT AT THE CHICAGO THEATER IN CHICAGO ILLINOIS THE EVENT CONSISTED OF LECTURE ENTITLE THE BRAINBODY CONTRACT FOLLOWED BY QUESTION IN ANSWER SESSION WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION WAS AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF WHO COULD ATTEND IN PERSON I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF THAT EVENT WHICH WERE  G ONE AND EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMARTMATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPASCITY ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IS CORRECT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL IN STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN PROGRAMME THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IN THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF YOUR NIGHT IT HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES LIKE TRACKING THE AMOUNT OF RAPID I MOVEENT AN SLOWWAVE SLEEP THAT YOU GET THINGS ARE ESSENTIAL TO REALLY DILING IN THE PERFECT NIGHT SLEEP FOR YOU I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON AN EIGHTSLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR WELL OVER TWO YEARS NOW AND IT HAS GREATLY IMPROVED MY SLEEP BY FALL ASLEEP FAR MORE QUICKLY I WAKE UP FAR LESS OFTEN IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND I WAKE UP FEELING FAR MORE REFRESH THAN I EVER DID PRIOR TO USING IN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER IF YOU LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO SAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP KERNALLY SHIPS TO THE U SSA CANDIDA OU K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE U AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOCT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN  G ONE IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING A G ONE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEY SPONSER THE LIVE EVENT THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL DRINK  G ONE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES ALL OF MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT PROVIDES INSURANCE THAT I GET THE PROPER AMOUNTS OF THOSE VITEMEN'S MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIVER TO INSURE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY A G ONE YOU CAN GO TO DRINK

THAT SPECIAL OFFER AND NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO THE QUESTION IN ANSWER SESSION FROM OUR LIVE EVENT AT THE CHICAGO THEATER IN CHICAGO ILLINOIS I TURN SEVENTY SENOAS YOURVEST ADVICE TO KEEP MY BRAIN HEALTHY IN ALD A TERRIFIC QUESTION THE ADVICE I WOULD GIVE TO YOU AS SOMEBODY ABOUT TO REACH SEVENTY IS THE SAME ADVICE I GIVE TO ANYBODY WHICH IS THAT ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE THINGS  THAT IMPROVE CARTY OF ASCULAR HEALTH AND PROFUSION OF OU'R BODILY TISSUES ARE GOING TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE BRAIN A BECAUSE OF COURSE THE BRAIN AS A A A RICH CONSUMER OF FUEL REQUIRES VERY GOOD PORTALS TO DELIVER THOSE FUELS AND THAT CAPLERI'S MICROCAPALARIES AND ARTERIES AND SO FORTH NEED TO BE CLEANING CLEAR THAT'S THE BIG ONE THIS IS WHY I THINK THE PRESCRIPTION NOW IS THAT'S GENERALLY ACCEPTED AND HERE ON BORROWING FROM MY FRIEND PETER ATIA BUT ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YOUE MAY BE AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED MINUTES OF SO CALLED ZON TO CARDIO PER WEEK MOVEMENT THAT YOU CAN JUST BARLY CARRY OUT A CONVERSATION AM IT'S GOING TO BE VERY USEFUL ONE THING THAT'S OFTEN NOT DISGUSTES THAT LOAD BEARING EXERCISE OF SOME SORT IS GOING O BE BETTER PROVIDED YOUR BODY CAN TOLERATE IT BUT YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING THAT AM YOU CAN DO CONSISTENTLY OVER THOSE LONG DURATIONS A WITHOUT INJURING YOURSELF BUT THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING LITERATURE ABOUT HOW LOAD BEARING MOVEMENTS ACTUALLY GENERATE THE RELEASE OF HORMONS YES HORMONS FROM BONE THAT ACTUALLY CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AND MAY INFLUENCE HEALTH OF NURANS IN BRAINAREAS SUCH AS THE HIPPICAMPAS AND THERE I'M OF EXTENDING FROM PRECLINICAL DATA IN ANIMALS TO HUMANS BUT THERE'S SOME HUMANDATA STARTING TO EMERGE AT THAT'S TRUE IT'S ALSO TRUE AND THERE'S A WONDERFUL PAPER OUT I'M JUST TODAY OR YESTERDAY FROM DOCTORANDY GALPANS LAB AND COLLABORATORS TALKING ABOUT HOW A IF YOU LOOK AT COGNATIV HEALTH IT'S HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THINGS THAT RELATE TO STRENGTH AND THAT IS NOT O SAY THAT YOU SHOULD JUST DO STRENGTH TRAINING EXERCISE BUT WE KNOW THAT ALL PEOPLE TRULY ALL PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING SOME SORT OF RESISTANCE TRAINING TO OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK YOU KNOW AND WE KNOW THAT GRIP STRENGTH AND INCREASING A SYMMETRY IN GRIP STRENGTH BETWEEN THE THE TWO HANDS IS ONE OF THE INDICATORS OF DEFAZITS IN CONTROL FROM THE BRAIN OUT TO THE PERIFERI AND IT'S CORRELATED WITH COGNOF DECLINE IT ALS A SOME INTERESTING DATA ABOUT HOW WHEN OR THE FEET BECOME FLOPPY ANG KIND OF FLACID OR THE LACK OF ABILITY TO EXTEND ONE'S TOES I'M STILL WORK BEEN WEARIN THIS TOASTSPREADER THING AS I ON'T TRY THOSE THOSE HURR HURT I BROKE THIS FOOT A BUNCH OF TIMES BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU GET BETTER SPREATING YOURE TOES IT'S REALLY EXCITING AND IT'S REALLY EXCITING FOR SEVERAL REASONS IT'S REALY EXCITING CAUSE HERE'S MORE STABILITY IN YOUR FEET YOU CAN RUN AND MOVE AND DO THINGS BETTER WITHOUT PAIN BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT BELIEVE IT ORE NOT JUST AS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THATHEREGOIN TO DO WHEN YOU COME INTO THIS WORLD AS SCRAPED THE BOTTOM OF YOUR FOOT AND LOOK FOR THE BOBINSKI REFLECTS WHICH IS A NERL TRANSMISSION A REFLECTS ASALL REFLECTES ARE AM BUT IT'S TESTING THAT THE SENCURO THE HEALTH OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT OVER TIME YOU NO AGAIN THER MANY COROLETS OF DEMENSHA MANY MANY CORLETS OF DEMENCHA BUT IT AN INABILITY TO FINELY CONTROL THE EXTREMITIES IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM SO A STRENGTH TRAINING CART OFASKAR TRAINING THESE ARE KIND OF AM STEROTYPED ANSWERS FOR FOR YOURE QUESTION AND YET THOSE ARE REALLY THE PRIME MOVERS AAGAINST CARDIOVASCULAR AN THRUVE OVASCULAR DISEASE AND THEN OF COURSE AM THERE'S OU KNOW ID BE REMISS IF I DIDN THROW IN SOMETHING THAT WAS A LIT MORE EDGY CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO UM YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RARE OUR INTERESTING DATA ABOUT THE USE OF DRUGS TO INCREASE A SEAT OF COLING TRANSMISSION RIGHT I MEAN I WAS VISITING A NOBLE PRIZE WINTER AT COLUMBIA TO LEARN ABOUT HIS INCREDIBLE WORK AH SOME YEARS AGO AND SAW THAT HE CHOU'D NO FEWER THAN FIVE PIECES OF NIKORETT GUM SOMETHING I DON'T RECOMMEND DURING THIS SHORT MEETING AND I SAID WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT HE SAID WELL YOU KNOW I DON'T SMOKE ANY MORE VICS I DON'T WANT LUNG CANCER BUT UM YOU KNOW HE SAID NICOTINE IS IU A PROTECTIVE AGAINST PARKANSAS AND ALSEHIMERS HOW CAN THAT BE AND HE SAID WELL YOU KNOW IT DECREASES IN NEURMODULATION DOPEMIN A SIT O COLIN CORRELATED WITH COGNA DECLINE CEEP YOUR BRAIN SHARP AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO I'M NOT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO TAKE NICOTINE IT INCREASES BLOOD PRESSURE THEYS A CONSTRICTION U BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING CONSIDERATION YOU KNOW SOME OF THE EMERGING COLONERGIC AND DOPAMINERGIC DRUGS E WAYS TO INCREASE A SEETO COLING AND DOPO IN OUR SCERTAINLY INTRIGUING AND I WON'T TELL YOU WHO THAT PERSON IS BUT HIS NAME IS RICHARD AXEL NEXT QUESTION YA HOW CAN I OPTI MY SLEEP WHILE WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIFTS AS A FIRE FIGHTER TWENTY FOUR HOURS ON FORTY EIGHT HOURS OFF O K AND THIS PRBABLY ALSO PERTAINS TO NEW PARENTS AND IT PROBABLY ALSO PERTAINS TO ANY ONE THAT'S GOING THROUGH A PARTICULAR PARTICULARLY STRESSFUL TIME WHERE YOUR MICRO WAKING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT SAID NOCIOUS FIRE FIGHTERS SO WHAT DO WE KNOW WE KNOW BASED ON REALLY GOOD DATA THAT SHIFT WORK IS BAD FOR US IS JUST BAD WERE WE'RE A DIURNAL SPECIES WE'RE NOT NOCTURNAL BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SHIFT WORKERS BECAUSE YOU ESSENTIALLY KEEP US ALL SAFE AND MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND AND UM AND SO WE NEED YOU AND WE WANT YOU HEALTHY SO AONE OF THE MAIN THINGS IS THAT YOU CAN MAKE SURE TAT YOU STAY ON THE SAME SLEEP WAKESCATCHA WILL SCHEDULSCUSE ME FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS IT'S THE SWING SHIFT THAT'S REALLY UM THE WORST AH YOU CAN TELL YOUR BOSS I SAID THAT UM AND IF THEY WON'T AGREE AND YOU'RE DOING THIS TWENTY FOUR HOUR ON TWENTY FOUR HOUR OFF THEIR COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL THE MAIN WAY TO WAKE UP YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT FEEL LIKE A TRIPLEOSSPRESSO IS GOING TO BE THAT LIGHT EXPOSURE TO THE EYES AND IF YOU CAN'T GET IT FROM SUNLIGHT IS GOING TO BE FROM ANY BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT I'M NOT A HUGE PROPONENT OF THE DAYLIGHT SIMULATORS THE VERY EXPENSIVE YOU CAN SIMPLY BUY NINE HUNDER LUCKS EL D FAR MORE INEXPENSIVELY I N'T AVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO ANY COMPANY THAT THAT SELLS THESE BUT YOU CAN FIND THEM ON AMAZON O WHEREVER YU YOU HAPPEN TO PREFER TO PURCHASE THINGS UM OR YOU CAN JUST GET REALLY CLOSE TO A BRIGHT LIGHT ANY TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO WAKE UP EVEN IF YOU DON'T FEEL THAT IT HELPS YOU WAKE UP VERY MUCH MOSTLY FOR THE MELATONAN SUPPRESSION CAUSE BRIGHT LIGHT WILL VERY ACUTELY SUPPRESS MELATONAN AND THEN THE REAL QUESTION FROM SHIFT WORKERS ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE SHOULD I CATCH UP ON SLEEP OR IS THAT  GOING TO BE PROBLEMATICSHI JUST STAY UP IN THE NEXT CYCL AND THE ANSWER THERE IS A LITTLE BIT NUANCE BUT THE BEST ANSWER I CAN GIVE ACROSS THE BOARD IS IF THIS IS A PATTERN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN REGULARLY OVER SAY MONTHS OR YEARS THEN GET WHATEVER SLEEP YOU CAN GET WHATEVER SLEEP YOU CAN IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOUR DOING SOMEWHAT ACUTELY LIKE YOUR TRAVELING TO EUROPE IND YOUR SCAN A FORCE YOURSELF TO STAY UP A DAY AND A HALF THEN U IN IN THAT CASE I WOULD SAY NO NEED TO TO GET THE MAXIMUMOU SLEEP JUST TRY ANG STAY WITH THE LOCAL SCHADUAL  WE HAVE AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT SHIFT WORK THAT SOMEHOW UM MAYBE DIDN'T GET AS MUCH RECOGNITION AS IT SHOULD AVE UM FOR SHIFT WORKERS AND WILL TRY AND GET IT OUT IN BETTER FORM WE DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED AND YOU NO A TOP CARTING THINGS IN A WAY THAT GETS THEM OUT TO THE MOST PEOPLE A ONE THING I WILL SAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANNOUNCE THAT OUR WEBSITE HUBRAN LOWDOT COMAS COMPLETELY REVAMP SO IT'S HIGHLY SEARCHABLE WILL TAKE YOU TO EXACT TIMES STAMPS AND IS AND NOW YOU CAN SEGREGATE OU TIME STAMPS FROM NEWS LETTERS FROM ALL THE STUFFS TO THANKS TO A LOT OF EFFORT BY MY AMAZING TEAM YOU CAN NOW NAVIGATE THAT PSYTE WITH WITH REAL PRECISION S IF YOU WANTS A EIGHTY EIH TY ADA ROLE KIDS YES NO FOR INSTANCE IT WILL TAKE YOU TO PRECISE TIME STAMPS THAT WILL ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES NEXT QUESTION PLEASE HOW DOES HYPNOSIS THERE AP PE WORK WELL THISIS A UM A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC TO ME BECAUS MY COLLAGUE ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF PSYCHIATRY AT STAMFORD DAVID SPEAGL IS HE WORLD EXPERT IN HYPNOSIS AND ITS NERL UNDERPINNINGS AND ITS USE FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AM HIS FATHER WAS A HYPHYPNOTISTS ALSO A PSYCHIATRIS UM AND WHEN PEOPLE HERE HYPNOTISM THEY THINK OF STAGEIHYPNOTISM AND BEING YOU KNOW UP ON STAGEAN DOING THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE BUT REALLY IT'S WHEN WHICH I GOT CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OR WELL MISS APPLICATIONS OF HYPNOSIS WERE TIME IT SELF DIRECTED HYPNOSIS I REALLY WISH THEREWAS A BETTER NAME BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HYPNOSIS IS GOING TO ADVANCE VERY FAR AS A FIELD FRANKLY BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS HYPNOSIS UM AND IT'S IT WOULD BE LIKE IF PSYCHODELICS WERE JUST CALLED DRUGS RIG WE WERE TAT AND THE EGHTIES THAT DRUGS ARE BAD AND THAT YOUR BRAIN ON DRUGS LOOKS LIKE AN OMELET AND THAT'S BAD AND IF YOU LIKE OMELETS THE'RE STILL BAD AND DRUGS DRUGS OF ABUSE ARE BAD AND ANASHALLY I HOPE WE CAN TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT PSYCHODELICS AT SOME POINT BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S A LITLE BIT OF A RUN AWAY TRAIN AROUND THE TOPIC OF PSYCHODELICS NOW I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW A WE APPROACH THAT ENTIRE LANDSCAPE BUT HYPNOSIS I PSENTIALLY WORKS BY ALLOWING SOME ONE TO PLACE THEIR OWN BRAIN INTO THIS VERY UNIQUE STATE EARLIER WE ARE TIME ABOUT NERO PLASTICITY AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT NEURL PLASTICITY INVOLLS INTENSE FOCIS FOLLOWED BY DEEP REST IN THE FORM OF DEEP SLEEP OR NON SLEEP DEEP REST MAY BE EN RECGRUBENING IT AND COLIC LAYING THERE HYPNOSIS IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE HYPNOSIS IS IN A STATE IN WHICH YOU ARE FOCUS IS VERY NARROW THE CONTEXT IS VERY NARROW BUT YOU'RE VERY VERY RELAXED SO MAYBE THE RUBEN EXAMPLE OF BEING BRAIN ACTIVE AN BODY VERY STILL IS A BIT MORE LIKE HYPNOSIS TO BE FAIR WHY WOULD IT BE THE CASE THAT DAVIDSPEAGLE AND HIS DAD HAVE LITERALLY A TOOL THAT IS APPROVED BY THE PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATE LY MAJOR MERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION WHERE THEY CAN THINGER OUT HOW HYPNOTIZABLE YOU ARE BY HAVING YOU LOOK UP AND TRY AND CLOSE YOUR EYELIDS WHILE CONTINUING TO LOOK UP THE SO CALLED SPEAGAL IROL TEST SOUNDS PRETTY WACKY RIGHT THIS IS LIKE TIKTOK LEVEL WACKI WELL THE REASON IS YOU HAVE CRANIAL NERVES SO SIT MOR LESS NEAR YOUR NECK THAT ALLOW YOU TO DIRECT YOUR FOCUS YOUR EYES UPWARD AND THEN YOU AVE CRANIAL NERVES THAT HAVE YOUR EYES GO DOWN AND THE ONES THAT THE CRANIAL NERVES THAT DRIVE YOUR EYES UP ARE ASSOCIATE WITH ALERTNESS AND EYES OPEN NO SURPRISE AND THE CRANIAL NERVES THEIRE ASSOCIATED WITH POINTING YOUR EYES DOWN AND CLOSING YOUR EYELIDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT WITH DROWSING IS SLEEP AND LACK OF ALERTNESS THERE'S OV A PUSHPOLL IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SPEAGL SPEAGLES DADY AND HIM FIGURED OUT CAUSE THEIR GENIUSES THAT IF SOMEBODY CAN MAINTAIN UPWARD GAZE WHILE CLOSING THEIR EYELIDS TWO THINGS HAPPEN ONE YOU'LL SEE THE WHITES OF THEIR EYES AS PREE CREEPY TOO THAT MEANS THEIR HIGHLY HYPNOTIZABLE BECAUSE THAT IS A REFLECTION OF THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY CAN ENTER A BRAIN STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE BOTH VERY AWAKE AND VERY RELAXED PRECOOL NOW IF THAT SOUNDS CON A WACKEY CAUSE YOU 'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE PERIFERY KEEP IN MIND THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY ENTRY POINTS FOR DIAGNOSING CONCUSSION IS TO SHINE A LIGHT IN ONE EYE AND HAVE THAT PUPIL CONSTRECT AND THEN SEE WHETHER NOT THE OTHER PUPIL CONSTRICTS THE SO CAL CONSENSUALR PUPIL LARY REFLEX ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY N AVE BEEN BOTHERED BY THIS FROM DAY ONE IT SHOULD BE CALLED THE NONCONSENTUAL PUPIL REFLEX CAUSE THE OTHER EYE DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE IF EVERYTHING'S WORKING IN ANY CASE IF YOU HAVE A HARD HIT TO THE HEAD YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU SHINE LIGHT IN ONE EYE PUPIL CONSTRICTS IN THE OTHER ONE STAYS REALLY DILATE IN THE GO CAN GET THIS PERSON THE EMERGENCY ROM BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A SEVERING OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE BRAINS SO LOOKING IN THE EYES AND TRYING TO DEDUCE WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING MORE SSENTIALLY WITHIN THE CAVERNS OF THE SKULL IND THE BRAIN IS NOT A NEW THING IT IS A PRIMARY DIAGNOSTIC TOOL IN NEUROLOGY IT'S ALSO AW YOUR PARENTS AN KNOW TAT YOU WERE TAKEN DRUGS WHEN YOU CAME IN THE DOOR CASE YOUR PUPILS WERE LIKE THAT BIG AND THAT REFLECTS A DIFFERENCE INAUTONOMIC ARAUSAL IN BASICALLY STIMULANTS IS FEELL DILATE THEIR PUPILS IS ALSO WHY THE STORY ABOUT BELLADONA PEUPLE INTENTINALLY DILATING THEIR PUPILS TO TRICK PEOPLE INTO THINKING THAT THEY WERE ATTRACTED TO THEM THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ONE A LOT TOO PSYKE NOT A PRECURSOR A GOOD RELATIONSHIP SYKE SOME ONES USING THEIR PHYSIOLOGY TO PRETEND THAT THEIRE ATTRACT IS THE OTHER PERSON THINKS THAT THEYARE ATTRACTS THAT THEY MIGHT BECOME ATTRACTED ANYWAY IT'S A RECIPE FOR FAILURE ALMOST AS BAD AS MOST OF THE DATING APS HI WOULD KNOW I'M NOT ON UM BUT FROM WHAT I HEAR O K SO WHERE WERE WE HYPNOSIS UM WHEN YOU ARE IN A STATE OF ELEVATED ATTENTION BUT VERY RELAXED GUESS WHAT NERL PLASTICITY A CURS MUCH FASTER BECAUS YOUR CENSIALLY MERRYING THE TWO STATES THAT ARE NORMALLY DIVORCED WHICH ARE HIGHTEN LEVELS OF ATTENTION FIRST AND THEN DEEP RASED YOUR ESSENTIALLY PUTTING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM INTO A MORE I WOULD'T CALL IT HYPER PLASTIC TATE BUT A MORE PLASTIC STATE AND FOR PEOPLE THT ARE HIGHLY HYPNOTIZABLE THE SUCCESSORATES AT FOR INSTANCE SMOKING CESSATION PAIN RELIEF ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE A SPEGA LAB HAS PUBLISHED A NUMBER OF THESE SO I THINK SELF HYPNOSIS IS IS A VERY INTERESTING TOOL I JUST HOPE THAT THEY RENAME IT SO THAT IT A STANDS A CHANCE OF GETTING OFF THE GROUND ME ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU LEARN AS A PUBLIC FACING EDUCATOR IS THAT WHAT THINGS ARE CALLED HAS A GREAT IMPACT ON WHEATHER OR NOT THEY ACHIEVE ANY KIND OF U USE IN THE WORLD ANDSE WHY I DECIDED TO A SWALLOW THE THE DIFFICULT PILL OF A PARTIALLY RENAMING YOGANEDRA AS NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST I DON'T LIKE TO DO THAT YOGANEDRA HAS MORE THAN A THOUSAND YOUR HISTORY BUT IT'S WHEN PEOPLE HEAR YOGANEDRA UNLESS THEY ARE VERY OPEN MINDED THEY HEAR MAGIC CARPET THEY HEAR LEVITATION AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE D THAT'S NOT HOW I FEEL BUT FOR YEARS I TALKED ABOUT YOGANEDRITS SO COOL IT'S LIKE SLEEP STATBUT IS A LIKE YE LIKE YOGANEDRA O K AND UT IF YOU COME FROM A CULTURE WHERE THAT'S DISGUSTD THEYARE ALL ABOUT IT AND SO NONSLEEP DEEP REST YOU KNOW I FELT LIKE ARIHT LEAVE MY NAME OUT OF IT YOU KNOW I'LL BE DEAD EVENTUALLY IMAN IM IN THIS LINE OF ADVISORS RIHTUM LIKE APPROACHING FIFTY  LIEYOMO I'M WINNING IN MY MY LINEAGE BUT SHOULD I BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO YOU KNOW LIVE PAST YOU KNOW BULLET CANCER OR CARCRASH FAR ENOUGH THEN YOU KNOW AND ASTY ARE HOPEFULLY WILL PERSIST IN I DON'T NEED A PIECE OF IT IS JUST THE HOPE IS THAT PEOPLE WILL LEARN TO PUT THEMSELVES IN TO BRAINSTATES THAT CAN BE ADAPTED FOR THEM SO BE NICE IF SOMETHING SOME ONE COULD COMEUP WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN HYPNOSE ASS I THINK SPEAGLE WOULD AGREE SUPRINCIST IN PSYCHODELICS AS MEDICINE TO BE DONE WITH SOMEBODY WITH EXPERIENCE WORRIED ABOUT UNLOCKING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS YE YOU SHOULD BE AH WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY AND WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS O K UM BARBED WIRE QUESTION WE LIKE THAT UM PSYCHODELICS WHALET'S JUST BACK UP A LITTLE BIT AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE THING THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN PSYCHODELICS OR ANY THING ELSE WHEN IT COMES TO REWIRING THE BRAIN WHICH IS THAT ULTIMATELY REWIRING OF THE BRAIN IS ABOUT SHIFTS IN NEROMODULATORS DE OPOMING SERATONAN EPINEFRONORIPANEFERONASETO CALLING AND IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT Y O ESCESSORISE SELECTIVE CERATONAND REUPTAKEN HIPITORS HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR ENTRY POINTS FOR ATTEMPTS TO TREAT THINGS LIKE DEPRESSION OVER THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS OR MORE A WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE THERE WAS THAT'S WHEN THE BOOK LISTENING TO PROSETTE CAME OUT PUT PRIOR TO THAT THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF DRUGS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THAT CASE TO CHANGE LEVELS OF NAUROMADULATORS LIKE CERATONAN OR CIDOCOLIN OR DOPOMINE IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURE OR TREAT A DISEASE BUT KEEP IN MIND DESPITE THE VARIED SUCCESS OF ESSESSORISE A TOPICAN TO ITSELF THAT THERE'S A STRONG BELIEF AND THERE HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME THAT IF ESSESSORIZE WORKED IT WASN'T BECAUSE THE DEPRESSED BRAIN IS DEFICIENT IN CERATONAN BUT RATHER BECAUSE INCREASING CERATONAN OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE NAURO PLASTICITY RAC IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S A SEGWAY FOR SAYING THAT WHEN YOU SAY PSYCHODELICS THATS A BROAD CATEGORY OF DRUGS NOWDAYS PEOPLE EVEN LUMP KEDAMINE INTO THAT ALTHOUGH TECHNICALL ITS NOT A PSYCHADELIC BUT THAT IS A CLASSIC IF YOU WILL PSYCHODELICS ARE ELESTY LECIRGACASIDIATH MY AND SYLISIBAN IT CA MUSHROOMS ALTHOUGH COMES ANOTHER SOURCE S AS WELL A THE MAJOR EFFECT OF CYLISIBON IS TO STIMULATE A PARTICULAR CRATONAN RECEPTOR WHICH HAS ELEVATED DENSITY IN PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS AND INDEED THERE ARE MANY RECENT CLINICAL TRIALS MANY LET'S TO SAY A A SAY TWELVE TO TWENTY GOOD SIZE CLINICAL TRIALS DONE IT IN DIVERSE LOCATIONS ON THE PLANET MANY AT JOHN'S HOPKINS AND YOU SEEASF SOME IN SWITZERLAND SHOWING THAT ENHANCING AND HEAR YOUR NO AMUSING THE MECHANISTIC LANGUAGE ENHANCING THE TRANSMISSION OF THE RELEASE OF SERATONAN AN ACTIVATING PARTICULARCERATONAN RECEPTORS LEADS TO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE WHAT NAURO PLASTICITY NOW I SAY IT THAT WAY NOT TO ADABUNCH OF WORDS TO BUT BECAUSE THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER NOT THE EXPERIENCE THAT ONE HAS WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHODELICS IS CRITICAL TO THE CLINICAL OUTCOME ER A GROWING IDEA JUST AS A HYPOTHESIS I THINK IS EQUALLY INTERESTING IS THAT IT'S THE SERATONAN ITSELF AND THAT THE THINGS YOU SEE THE THINGS YOU HEAR THE THINGS YOU EXPERIENCE ARE NOT RELEVANT NOW A I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH PSYCHODELICS I AD A BAD TIME ON PSYCHODELICS AS A TEENA DRAWS ALSO PRETTY WAYWARD YOUTH BUT I I'VE HAD A BAD TRIP ON ELISTE I FOR YEARS I WAS SCARED THE PEOPLE R AN A DOSE ME WITH ELESTE AFTER THAT IT WAS SO BAD AM I THINK ACROSS THE BORD WE CAN SAY KIDS DOING PSYCHODELICS JU SEEMS LIKE A BAD IDEA THERE IT BRAINS ARE ALREADY HYPEROPLASTIC IF YOU HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO BY POLER TYPE ISSUES OR SKISAPHRENIA IT CAN EXASCERBATE THOSE ISSUES AND CERTAINLY CERTAINLY CERTAINLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF SOMEBODY THAT CAN GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE SESSIONS AS WELL AS THE PRECESSIONS WHICH ARE NOT DONE WITH PSYCHODELICS AS WELL AS THE SO CALLED INTEGRATION AFTERWARDS IT CAN BE AT REALLY SLIP PERY SLOPE I KNOW EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE REALLY SUFFERING IN THE AFTERMATH OF PSYCHODELIC JOURNEYS NOW THERE FEW INTERESTING POINTS AS WELL AND IT WOULDN'T BE FAIRIF I DIDN'T SAY THAT SEVERAL IF NOT MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD SO CALLED TREATMENT RESISTENT DEPRESSION AT LEAST IN THESE CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE REPORTED FEELING FAR BETTER AFTER SILSEIBEN THERAPY BUT THAT SCYLISIBONTHERAPY WAS DONE WITH SEVERAL PRECESSIONS THEN THE PSYCHODELIC SESSIONS THAN AFTER SESSIONS AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT THINGS TURN OUT WELL SO I THINK IT'S EARLY DAYS UM WHAT IS INTERESTING AND I THINK IMPORTANT IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT SYLISIBON THE AND THE STRUCTURE OF SYLISIBON IS VERY SIMILAR TO SERATONAN ITSELF VERY SIMILAR BUT IT ACTIVATES PARTICULAR RESEPTORS LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW SIMILAR TO SERATONAN IT IS AND THAT MICRODOSING SYLISEIBAN I SHOULD SAY THE DATE ON MICRODOSING SYLISEIBAN SOMETHING THAT'S IN CRECINGLY POPULAR IS NOT PARTICULARLY A COMPELLING IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT IT DOES IT'S NOT CLEAR IF IT'S OF  AT ANOF ANY USE AND I THINK THE DANGER HERE IS THAT WE END UP IN A SITUATION AS WE DID WITH FRANKLY WITH CANABAS AND BY THE WAY I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO DEMONIZES CANABAS I THINK IT HAS ITS USES FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE BUT VERY HIGTAH C CONCENTRATION CANABAS CAN BE A PROBLEM E SPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE TO HAVE A PREDISPOSITION OF PSYCHOSIS AND ANY ONE THAT TELLS YOU THAT CANABAS IS INTADDICTIVE JUST SAY GREAT DON'T SMOKEUEED FOR A WEEK BUT SEE HOW YOU DO YE AND LET'S GO ON A PLANE TRIP TOGETHER T AND HOW ARE YOU SLEEPING AND Y SO I THINK UM THE CHRONIC CANABASTS USERS ARE STARTING TO TAKE NOTE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES IT CAUSES BUT AGAIN THERE ARE SOME SOME CLINICAL APPLICATIONS NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE SORT OF THE THE U HIGH SPEED TRAIN PSYCHODELICS LIKE D M T AN THAT THAT'S FAR FEWER FAR LESS DATA AVAILABLE THERE AND THEN MDIA MAY ASSISTED PSYCHOTHERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF P T ST THERE THE DATE I THINK ARE MORE ROBUST I THINK WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE LEGALIZATION ORATLYSTCREM D CRIMINALIZATION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT MDIA MA IS METHELINE DIOXY METH AN PEDEMI SO FOR PEOPLE THAT LIKE DOPOMINERGIC STATES IT'S A PARTICULARLY COMPELLING A STATE TO BE IN SO MUCH SO THAT THEY COULD OVER INDULGE IN M DI A MA AND THEN THERE IS THE ISSUES OF PURITY AND I COULD DO A FIVE HOUR POCAST ON THE SRITE NOW SO I THINK THE IMPORTANT POINT IS APPROACH WITH CAUTION KIDS ABSOLUTELY NOT UM AND I THINK IT'S AN EXCITING LANDSCAPE VERY EXCITING AND WHEREAS A DESCUSSION LIKE THE ONE WE JUST HAD UM WOULD WOULD HAVE GOT ME FIRED A FEW YEARS TAGO I MEAN STAMPHRODAS BIG PROGRAMS NOW LOT OF PHILANTHROPY FEDERAL GRANTS AND MANY LABORATORIES A FOCUST ON THE STUDY OF PSYCHODELICS UM SO NOW I WOULD SAY STAY TUNED AM BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT NUROMA INCREASING NUROMAGULATOR LEVELS VERY ACUTELY WHETHER NOT IT'S WITH A PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR WHETHER NOT IT'S WITH PSYCHADELICS IS REALLY WHAT LIES AT THE HEART AOF THE RECOVERY THE POTENTIAL RECOVERY ISOULD SAY OR THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT HAPPEN TO OCCUR IN AH ANYONE THAT THAT EMBARKS ON THE SYCADELIC JOURNEY DO PEOPLE WHO MEDITATE ME LESS SLEEP THAN PEOPLE WHO DON'T OH THAT'S INTERESTING WELL WE KNOW THAT FROM A STUDY BY WENDYSAZUKI WHO I BELIEVE IF AND WHY YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE AND I THINK THEY DID IS NOW THE DEANOVARTS AND SCIENCES AT AND WY YOU YOU RAN A MEMORY LAB FOR A LONG TIME SHE'S SHE HAS DATEA SHOWING AM THAT EVEN TEN I THINK IT'S THIRTEEN BUT AS LITTLE AS TEN MINUTES OF MEDITATION SO TO BE SITTING STILL BREATHING FOCUSSING ON YOUR BREATHING DIRECTING ONE'S ATENTION TO THIRD E CENTER ET CETERA WE DON'T HAVE A THIRD EY THE PINELS OUGT TO BE THE THIRD EYE BUT AM I DONT KNOW WHY YOU SAY IT'S A LIGHT SENSITIVE TISSUE DEEP IN THE BRAIN BUT MAY THT'S WHAT THEY CALL THE THIRD I BUT IN ANY CASE THAT TYPE OF PRACTICE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE MEMORY FOCUS AKE LEARNING AH BUT THERE'S SOME INTERESTING FOOTNOTES IN THOSE PAPERS AH WHICH POINT TO THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE MEDITATE TOO CLOSE TO BEDTIME OFTENTIMES THEY HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING BECAUSE BASELY MEDITATION IS A FOCUSSING EXERCISE IT'S IT'S A PERCEPTIAL EXERCISE I DONLY A MEDITATION AS ANYTHING MYSTICAL IT'S A IT'S A SELF DIRECTED SHIFT IN YOUR PERCEPTION TO WHAT TO YOUR INTERROCEPTION TO YOUR INTERNAL STATE AS APPOST ANYTHING BEYOND THE CONFINES TO YOUR SKIN THERE'S NOTHING MYSTICAL ABOUT THAT AND THEN IN THAT STATE YOUR BRAIN STARTS TO GENERATE PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY THAT ARE DISTINCT FROM WHEN YOURE SHARING YOUR ATTENTION BETWEEN WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERNALLY AND WHAT'S GOING OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT IN THE WORLD RIGHT I THINK WE NEED TO DE MYSTIFI WHAT PEOPLE HAVE CLOAKED AS MYSTICL AND HEN I SAY CLOAKED I DON'T THINK THAT THE PEOPLE AT THE MEDITATE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS E THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING AH MYSTICL ABOUT IT BUT SOMETIMES WHAT WE EXPERIENCE THERE CAN FEEL MYSTICAL SO IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING I RECOMMEND DOING SOME SORT OF DEEP SOME SORT OF NONSLEP DEEP RESSE PRACTICE LIKE ANESTI ARE YO AKE YOGANEDRA ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE DIFFERENT ENESTY ARE GENERALLY LACKS THE AH THE INTENTION PEACE A AN THE ONCE THAT I PUT IN THE WORLD WE'VE STRIPPED AWAY THE INTENTIONS AND WE'VE STRIPPED AWAY ANY KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT AM THERE WAS A SOME SORT OF AM AT'S TO SAY LIKE CULTURAL ASPECT TO IT WHICH AGAIN IS IS UNIS ADMITTEDLY A BIT UNFAIR TO THE ORIGIN PRACTICE OF YOGANEDRA BUT THE PROM AGAIN IS THAT IN YO GANEDR YOURE CON BE DOING INTENTIONS AN HEARING LANGUAGE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE NOT ALL MIGHT DIVORCE YOU FROM THE THE TH THE WISH TO TO DO IT IN ANY CASE AM NONSLEEP DEE BREST ON ANY TIME OF DAY BUT A SPUSHIYO FALLS SLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS GOING TO BE USEFUL FOR HELPING YOU FALL BACK ASLEEP ORE AS MEDITATION AGAIN AS GOING I ENHANCE YOUR LEVEL OF FOCUS SO I DON'T THINK IT'S AM A GOOD PRACTICE IF YOUR IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING NOW TO FINALLY ANSWER QUESTION IF YOU MEDITATE CN YOU AFFORD TO SLEEP LESS A MY FRIEND MATWALKER WOULD SAY NOW HOWEVER MANY OF US CAN'T SLEEP AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO AND MANY OF US ARE NOT LIKE MAT WHERE WE CAN WAKE UP WITHOUT AN ALARM CLOCK  I'LL JUST KEEP SLEEPING IN SLEEPING UNLESS I WENT TO BED T LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS IS ACTUALLY INTERESTING AN THERE'S AN A SYMMETRY TO YOUR SLEEP NEEDS IF YOU GO TO BED MEMBER THAT OLD ADIGE YOUR EVERY HOUR BEFORE MIDNIGHT IS WORTH TOO AFTER WETL TURNS OUT THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE MEANT TO BE EARLY RISERS GOING TO BED AT EIGHT YOU'LL WAKE UP AT THREE OR FOUR FEELING GREAT YOU GO TO BED AT ELEVEN YOU FEEL GROGY AND THEIR GOOD REASONS TO EXPLAIN THAT BUT MAT WOULD SAY THAT YOU NEED YOUR SLEEP PERIOD I'M MORE OF THE CAMP BASED ON MY READ OF THE DATA AND YES WE ARE ALLOWED TO DISAGREE AND STILL BE FRIENDS IT'S A LOUD TH IN FACT MAT'S GOING TO DO A SERIES ON SLEEP WITH OUR PODCAST EVENTHOUGH HE HAS A TRIFIC POTCASTS OF HIS OWN O WHERE WE MAYBE DEBATEALOBI TOF THIS THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN AT LEAST REPLACE THE FEELING OF WAKEFULNESS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE LOST IF YOU DON'T SLEEP ENOUGH AND FOR ME REALLY THAT'S WHY ANASTY ARE BECAME SUCH A AN ATTRACTIVE TOOL TO DO FOR TEN OR THIRTY MINUTES EACH MORNING IF I DIDN'T SLEEP ENOUGH THE NIGHT BEFORE A MI FIRST LEARN ABOUT YOGANEDRA ACTUALLY AT A DICTION RECOVERY CENTER TRAMA A RECOVERY CENTER AND FLORIDA IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I'VE A FRIEND A SUPERTALENTED TRAMA THERAPIST WHO IS ALSO TREATS A DICTION THAT AM I'VE SENT MANY MANY PEOPLE TO AND HE HAS THIS KIND OF SEEMING WE DON'T LIKE WIZARD ABILITY TO AM GET PEOPLE WH ARE BEEN ATTICS TO NOPYATTICS AND AM ONE OF THE TOOLS HE USES IS AYOGANEDRA EVERY MORNING FOR THIRTY MINUTES IN EVENTUALLY AN HOUR WHICH SEEMS LIKE A LOT BUT THEN YO ALSO HAS THES PEOPLE WAKE UP VERY EARLY MAYBE AN HOUR BEFORE THEY WOULD NORMALLY WAKE UP AND GOING TO THAT LIMINAL STATE BETWEEN SLEEP IN WAKEFULNESS NOW MY EXPERIENCES THAT TEN TO TWENTY MINUTES OF ENASTY AR YOGANEDRA IS SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET A SOME SLEEP LOST AND ALLOWAT LY SMEED A FUNCTION O MANY PEOPLE REPORT THE SAME WE HAVE A STUDY GOING WITH THER SLEEP LABORATORY AT STAMPOR TO EXPLORE THIS IN MORE DEPTH AN A WHAT I CAN TELL YOU ECAUSE I'M INVOLVED IN SOME OF THIS WORK IS THAT THER ARE SEVERAL MILITARY UNITS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO GET SLEEP BECAUSE THEIR WORKING THAT HAVE TO RELY ON TOOLS LIKE THIS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL  AND I'M SURE THEY WILL TELL YOU AS I WILL THAT THEY PREFER TO GET EIGHT TO TEN HOURS OF SLEEP BUT GUESS WHAT THEY CAN'T AND SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY IS THAT WE DON'T GET TO PICK HOW MUCH WE SLEEP UNLESS YOU CAN BE COMPLETELY NARATIC ABOUT YOUR SLEEP HYCHEN WHICH MAKES YOU KIND OF THE LESS INTERESTING PERSON IN LIFE IS WHAT I'M TOLD A O GOING TO BED AT EIGHT IS GREAT LIKE SOMEER MOST OF THE TIME BE GOT A STAY UP EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I MEAN AFTER THEY RELEASE CHIMPAM PIRE ON NATPLICS I DISCOVERED THAT ENESTY ARE IS A VERY VALUABLE TOOL BECAUSE AND BY THE WAY CHIM BAMPIRE ANDS AND SUCCESSION HAVE A LOT OF PARALLELS AND IF YOU WATCH ONE UP IF I SERVED I INTERLEVE CHIM PEMPIRE SUCCESSION JIMPEMPIRE SUCCAIONG YOU SEARC TO REALIZE LIKE WOE LIKE WORK PRETTY SIMILAR UM AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY I PROMISE UM YOUR PODCAST HAS POSITIVELY CHANGED THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING ME HOW HAS IT CHANGED YOUR LIFE UH OUQUET UM WASN'T EXPECTING THAT ONE THANK YOU SEMENTHE UM WELL FIRST OF ALL I MEAN AS THIS LITTLE ELEVEN YEAR OLD TOLD ME I MEAN THIS IS IS IS ESSENTIALLY I WOULD HAVE DONE MY WHOLE LIFE UM I'M A FAIRLY PRIVATE PERSON BELIEVE AR NOT ON PRETTY INTERVERTED UASMELAN TIME ALONE UM AND I THINK THAT'S REQUIRED FOR ME TO I BE SAY OF FORMODES FORMODES ONE I'M EITHER READYING MYSELF THROUGH SLEEP UM AND ANESTY ARE TO DOU ONE OF THE OTHER THREE MODES IT WT IS A FIFTH MODE I'M ORE I'MIN ONE OF THESE OTHER THREE MODES WHICH ARE IS I'M EITHER FORGING FOR INFORMATION ORGANIZING THAT INFORMATION ARE DISPERSING THAT INFORMATION OR  GETTING READY TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN A AND THEN THERE'STHIS RELAXATION VACATION THING THAT THEY KEEP TELLING ME ABOUT BUT THEN I WENT TO ITALY AND THEN LY RICK AND I LIKE I HUNG OUT THERE AND UM AND IT IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WORK I ALSO DISCOVERED SOME REALY GREAT PODCAST ION'T UI THINK ONE OF THE COOLEST PODCASTS OUT THERE IF YOU LIKE ROCKIN ROLE WHICH I LOVE IS A HISTORY OF FIVE HUNDRED SONGS BY  INDRER HICKYS PODCAST ON ROCKA ROLL I LIKE THE NARUDY POCKETS LIK A GRADUATE OR AN EDUCATION AN ROCKAN ROLE IT'S SO COOL UM AND YOU'L EARN A LOT ABOUT MUSIC AN HISTORY IN THE MOBS INVOLVED AND ALL THAT STOFF IN FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD LIKE ALCOPONIES TO SIT THERE WRITE HIS EGG IT WAS THERE YOU KNOW SO WEIRD RIGHT MLIA AND THE ANHE DIASYPHOLIS AND LIKE SO I DON'T KOI FEEL ABOUT ALL THAT UM BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT UM SO I THINK THE PODCAST HAS BEEN WONDERFUL UM AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THINGS THAT I LOVE UM IF I HAD MY WAY ITWOULD BE MORE LIKE THIS ALTHOUGH MORE OF A DIALOGUE FRANKLY AH IT'S CHANGED UM MY UNDERSTANDING OF AND LIKE WHAT WHAT THE WORLD IS LIKE I YOU KNOW I I I CERTAINLY GET UM CRITIQUE AND THAT'S GOOD UM BUT AGAIN I WAS RAISED BY ICONICLAS IN PARTICULAR MY POSTOC ADVISE OR BEENBARRASS WHO UNFORTUNATELY VIVE WHEN I MENTION IS DEAD CAUSE I WORKED FOR HIM UM AND AH BUT YOU KNOW HE WAS EREALLY ENCOURAGED ALL OF US IN HIS LAB AND AND A AND OFTEN WE WERE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS I SPENT THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE RECORDING INTERVIEW WITH HIM THERE'SICHELLY DOCUMENTARY COMING OUT ABOUT BEN UM AND THEN I'M GOING TO RELEASE THE AUDIO A INTERVIEWS WITH BEN WHICH HE APPROVED BY THE WAY AND YOU'LL GET TO REALIZE THAT THE HISTORY OF WHAT YOU SEE IS OFTEN NOT WHAT THE DEAD PERSON REALLY DID OR SAID IT'S GOING TO BE FUNS I CAN'T WAIT TO THE RELEASE EST DOCUMENTARY AND THEN BEN GETS TO HAVE HIS VOICE AH INFUSE IT AND DO'LL BE COOL DOCUME INTRY BUT AS A SOME OF YOU KNOW T LIKE WHAT APPEARS TO BE IN WHAT WAS IN THE HISTORICAL MERITS IS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT IT WHAT REALLY HAPPEN BUT THAT'S JUST LIFE SO I I SUPPOSE THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT YOU KNOW I FEEL VERY HONORED WITHTHE OPPORTUNITY VERY VERY HONORED UM AND YOU KNOW IT'S A CHALLENGE AT TIMES I SUPPOSE THAT THE MAJOR CHALLEGES ARE WHEN THINGS ARE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT LIKE LITTLE CLIPS AND THINGIS THAT SORT BEING MISUNDERSTOOD DOESN'T FEEL GOOD BUT LUCK AT THE END OF THE DAY I FEEL LIKE THE LUCKIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD A BECAUSE I GET TO SPEND MY TIME LEARNING SO IT'S EITHER YOU KNOWM FORGING A'M ORGANIZING RI'M DISPERSING INFORMATION THAT I ALSO WANT AND THAT I FIND IT INCREDIBLY UM USEFUL IF OR IF NOT THAT AND A CERTAINLY INFORMITIVE AND AT TIMES INCHANTING AS WELL SO I TRYIND FOCAS ON THE POSITIVE AND I HAVE A NUMBER PRACTICES THAT HELP ME A DO THAT U AND I AM SOMEBODY WHO ENGAGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA I'M NOT A POSTING GHOST CON OFPERSE AND I I I WANT O UNDERSTAND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE CUTTLEFISH AR SUPERINTERESTING BUT HUMAN BEINGS ARE SUPERINTERESTING TO AND I HAVE A I A STRONG DRIVE FOR FOR MASTERY BUT ALSO UM I I DO HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF OF JUSTICE UM AND THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC AT TIMES I DOFIND JUSTICE AS FEELING LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING FOR US TO DO ABOUT SOMETHING LI SEING SOMETHING UPSETS US OR THE EXCITES US IS GREAT BUT THEN IF YOU HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF JUSTICE YOU E LIE THERE SOMETHINGYOU NEED TO DO ABOUT IT AND NOT EVERYBODY FEELS THAT AND THEN OF COURSE A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND AND I THINK AH FOR REASONS VERY PERSONAL TO ME THAT UM RELATE MOSTLIAGEIS HAVING A KIND OF INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF EXPERIENCES IN LIFE MANY OF WHICH WERE U LIKE SHOCKING DISTURBING EXCITING ANCHANTING THAT I WONT UNDERSTAND AND SO NO IT'S CHANGED THINGS BUT YOU NOT'S LIKE IW KNOW I GOT ONE TRUCK WHEN WATCH I YOU KNOWITSO NOT TO SAY THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT HAVING THINGS I THEIRE FEW THINGS I REALLY LOVE BUT LIKE MOSTLY LIKE I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE POTCASTS WE GOT A RECORD ON MONDAY WHICH IS ABOUT WILL POWER AND TENACITY AND IF I DON'T STOP MYSELF I'LL GIVE AT RIGHT NOW SO WHAT DO YOU FEEL IS THE NEXT BIG THING TO COME TO THE FOREFRONT IN THE HEALTHSPACE THANKS FOR THIS QUESTION UM ONE AH IS NON PROTEN TO ME NOACIDS I I LOVE THESE DEBATES ON LINE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE IT'S SO COOL CAUSE I GREW UP AND SEENG THESE DEBATES AND YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DEBATING ABOUT IT BUT THE DEBATE ISN'T WHAT'S INTERESTING IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS THE THING THAT PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THATS SURE TO SURFACE AT SOME POINT AND YOU'LL RIGHT NOW THERE'S A SUBSESSION LIKE SEED OILS I SEED OIL SEED OILS AND I I CAN'T DEEMEN I SEE TOILS ALL THE DAY TO SAY THAT IF YOU SEPARATE OUT THEIR COLORIC LOAD THERE'S NOT THING ANDAHERENTLY BAD ABOUT SEEDOILS AND IT SAIR I DON'T KNOW IT'S STILL IN EMERGING LITERATURE BUT THERE WAS A UM  SCIENTIST IT STAMFORD AT RUBENSTEIN WHO A PASSEDAWAY OF AT A RIHT OLD AGE A BRILLIANT SCIENTISTS WHO AM TALKED ABOUT AND I HAD ALLO DISCUSSIONS WITH WHEN I WAS A POSTOK ABOUT NON PROTINOMINOACIDS TURNS OUT HIS SON IS ANERA SCIENTIST AT YOU SE ASF SOTHER SONS A PHYSICIAN OU SEE ASF SAIS ANONOTHER ON THESE LOW PERFORMING FAMILIES UM AND ALL WONDERFUL PEOPLE UM AND YOU KNOW ED HAD DATA THAT YOU KNOW UNLIKE A LOT OF ANIMALS LIKE BIRDS UM THERE ARE CERTAIN TO MINOACIDS WHICH ARE NON PROTINO MINOACIDS THAT EXIST IN FAIRLY HIDENSITY AN SEEDS AND NOTS WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT SEEDS AND NUTS ARE BAD I AD OMINS THIS EVENING IGESID PLEASE UM BUT NON PROTINO MINOACIDS ARE SIMILAR ENOUGH TO MAMALIAN PROTINE AMINOACIDS THAT IF THEY ARE CONSUMED IN ABUNDANCE AND PERHAPS ESPECIALLY IN LIQUID FORM THAT THEY MAY AGAIN MAY CAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW THIS IS ABOUT WHERE I THINK THERE'S AN INTEREST IN GROWING INTEREST THEY MAY BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE INTO CERTAIN PROTINES OF OUR TISSUES OF OUR BODY THAT POTENTIALLY EDTHOUGHT COULD LEAD TO MISFOLDING OF THOSE PROTINES AND MAY EXPLAIN CERTAIN FORMS OF NARRODEGENERATION ANDOTHER NERO COGNITIVE A CHALLENGES SO I'M I THINK NONPROTINO MINOACDS ARE GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION NOW THEIR LOTS OF NON PROTINO MINOACIDS THAT ARE NOT UM THAT DON'T COME FROM FOODS BUT I THINK THE DISCUSSION AROUND NONPROTINOMINOACIDS FROM FOODS IS GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING AH SO THAT'S ONE AREA THE OTHER AREA D PERHAPS YOU PICKED UP ON THE SOLBUT TO NIGHT IS THAT I LIKE THE NUTS AN BOLTSY STUFF AROUND STRAS NOR AL PLASTICITY BUT THE HIGH LEVEL STUFF YOU KNOW I THINK UM YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AH YOU KNOW STRUCTURE THOUGHT ABSTRACT THOUGHT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE FREE WILL DISCUSSION I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A CAREER ENDER UM I'M FRIENDS WITH ROBERTS OF POLSKY AND HE'S GOT GREAT BOOK COMING OUT ABOUT THIS I'M CALLED DETERMINED SO YE OVOSY DOESN'TBELIEVE IN FREE WILL BUT HE'S FAR SMARTER THAN I EVER COULD BE AND UM IT JUST FEELS LIKE HE I DON'T KNOW THAT THRE'S AN END POINT WITH THAT ONE AM BUT IF ANYONE COULD FIND IT WOUDBE BE ROBERT AM HE'S OSO SMART A BUT I THINK THAT THE HIRER LEVEL STUFF A CREATIVITY ABSTRACT REASONING IN THOUGHT DEFINING AND AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT STATES THAT WE CAN GO INTO IN WAKING AND AND I CONFESS UM WITHOUT A HINT OF OF SHEEPISHNESS ABOUT IT THAT I ALSO THINK THE THE NOTION OF OF SPIRITUALITY AND THE BELIEF IN  THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND ARE CURRENT IN CONSCIOUS ON DERSTANDING IS SUPERINTERESTING UM I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS AS A SPECIES WE ARE A WE'VE BEEN CHALLENGION CONFLICTED FROM GO AT LEAST THAT'S WITH THE HISTORICAL SCRIPTURE TELLS US M AND THAT IT SORT OF INHERENT TO OUR EXPERIENCE THAT UM LIFE IS CHALLENGING AND PERPLEXING AND AND ALSO WONDERFUL AND SO I THINK A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OF HOW TO NAVIGATE ALL THAT I' MEAN THI LIKE THE STUFF IN OUR SKULLS EXCEPT FOR THE EYES WHICH BY THE WAY  TO PIECES OF BRANDTAT ARE NOT IN YOUR SKULL THE RETINAS HAVE TO POINTED OUT UM YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S TRICKY AND WE'RE TRYNG TO USE THAT VERY TISSUE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND SO I'M ENTRIGUED BY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'RE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF SELF THAT IU MAYBE ARE NOT UM INTENDED TO BE EXPLORED BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REALLY OF US RIGHT BRAINS INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER IS AN INTERESTING AREA CERTAINLY FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION BUT I'M I'M FASCINATED BY N AND AN EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU KNOW IT SOME POINT OUR SPECIES WILL BOTH UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF OR EMOTIONS MECHANICS OF OUR THOUGHT PROCESS CREATIVITY AND SO ON BUT THAT WE WILL ALSO ALLOW ROOM FOR THE FOR THE STUFF THAT WE CAN'T EXPLAIN WITH SCIENCE AND TO ALLOW ROOM FOR THAT IN OUR IN OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVE THAT CAN BE POWERFUL AND WELL UNDERSTANDING THINGS IN GREAT DETAIL AND PUTTING MECHANISM AND UTILITY AROUND THAT AND APPLYING THAT IS WONDERFUL IT'S THE  IT'S THE STUFF OF MY LIFE UM WHICH IS OBVIOUS AH I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S GREAT VALUE IN IM NOT TRYING TO CONTROL AND UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING AND ENJOYING THE THE THE MYSTERY OF THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE CLEARLY A GREATER THAN US HOW DO YOU BALANCE HAVING FUN WITH HAVING SUCH A RICH KNOWLEDGE AND PASSION IN NEURO SCIENCE AND OPTIMIZATION FUN UM PEOPLE ASK ME LIKE WHAT YOU DO FOR FUN I THINK PEOPLE THINK I DO ALL THE PROTOCALS LIKE SURE I GET MY SUNLIGHT I DRINK MY WATER II DO THEM BUT UM A FUN UM I LIKE LEARNING AHI LIKE LEARNING I LIKE I DO ENJOY PHYSICAL MOVEMENT I LIKE LEARNING YOU KNOW FOR ME THAT O CASE LIKE FOR ME IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS I DON'T KNOW MAYBE I'M WEIRD UM CERTAINLY BEEN TOLD THAT UM LIKE THE OTHER DAY THERE'S A FROG IN MY SWIMMING POOL E JUST LIKE SEEING THERE LIKE AND AND I'V JUST LIKE SPEND SOME TIME LOOK IN ATAM BACK AND FORTH AND AND THEN I HAD ALL SORTS OF IDEAS ABOUT LIKE LIKE WHAT'S HE DOING AND WHAT'S HE THINKING AND THEN I THINKING HOW OLIVER SACKS USED TO SPEND TIME IMAGINING E PERIENCE EXPERIENCING LIFE HAS A BAT THROUGH ONLY ECHO LOCATION HE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND I THOUGHT AND WHY WOULD HE DO THAT RAYT IS THAT AND THAT'S CON ACUTE IS LIKE DELIGHTFUL OLD MAN I YET AT SIX HUNDRED POUND FREEWAIGHT SQUAT WHEN THE STAKE CALIFORNIA SQUATTING CHAMBEG A BEN LIKE ALSO LIKE PRETEND HE WAS A BAT ITS A WEIRD DO ID MATHEM PETA MEANS RAISED MOTOR CYCLES YOU KNOW LIKE HUNG OUT WITH MOVY STARS BUT THEN ALSO WAS LIKE A RECLUSE AND LIKE ROCKS OH GET THAT'S A WEIRD SCIENTIST BEEN AROUND A LOT OF THOSE BUT YOU KNOW IN DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM I MEAN THAT THAT EXERCISE OF AND LIKE SEEING SOMETHING HE THOUGHT WAS COOL LIKE A BAT YOU KNOW ALLOWED HIM TO ALSO USE THEORY OF MIND KIN THINK  WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE TO HAVE LOCKED IN SINDRUM AND ONLY BE ABLE TO LIKE BLINK YOUR EYES TO COMMUNICATE AND AND GAVE HIM AN INCREDIBLE COMPASSION AND SENSITIVITY FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT UM THEN HE TRANSMUTED INTO THE FORM OF LIKE THESE WONDERFUL BOOKS SO FOR ME FUN IS REALLY ABOUT DOING THE THINGS THAT I DO SYSTEMATICALLY EACH DAY BUT THEN WHEN SOMETHING EXCITES ME I KNOW THAT FEELING I KNOW IT PHYSICALLY IN MY BODY AND TO JUST FOLLOW THAT TRAIL LIKE A WEIRDO RIGHT LIKE A WEIRDO JUST LIKE BARRAST WAS A WEIRD AND BARBERA CHAPMAN WAS WEIR ND LIKE LIKE I THINK EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE WEIRD IF YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO SEE THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK ARE REALLY COOL AND THER BUNCH OF THINGS THAT I THINK ARE REALLY COOL THAT ENCHANT ME THAT A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE LOVE TOO AND I KNOW THAT CAUS IT LIKE I SEE WE'RE ALL WATCHING THAT VIDIO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM BUT I THINK FOR ME FUN IS IS IN THE THE PRACTICE OF TRYING TO STAY OPEN TO THE LIKE THE LITTLE THINGS UM THE LITTLETHINGS THAT KIDS SAY ARE ALWAYS DELIGHTFUL CAUS THEYRE NOT FILTERING THROUGHALL THE BOLSHE THAT WE FILTER OURSE OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE THROUGH BUT ELSO JUST UM YHE I LIKE READING AND LEARNING EXERCISEING I MEAN I LIKE TO THINK I'M NOT A VRY WOULD IN PERSON BUT AT THE SAME TIME UM I' MEAN I DIDN'T SEE THE BARBI MUVI UM NOW NO DISRESPECT TO BARBI I I INOIT I GO TO MUVIS I DO THAT KIND OF THING ON WHAT WHAT ELSE IS  DO AT SOME POINT YOU KNOM UM WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO UH ANYWAY I MEAN I DELIGHT IN IN CERTAIN THINGS A AS THAT YOU NOW KNOW FAR TOO MUCH ABOUT BUT UM FUN IS A RELATIVE TERM THAT'S A HARD QUESTION ATHANKS FOR THE PASS DO YOU BELIEVE TIME CHANGES DUE TO DAYLIGHT SAVING'S TIME IS WORTH A POTENTIAL LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY DAYLIGHT SAVING TIMES ANTI HEALTH  GET THIS IS WHERE I'LL GET LIKE IT'S JUST S JUST DUMB IT'S JUST DUM IT IT'S JUST SO DUMB IT'S IT MAKES NO SENSE I MEAN THE THE DIRECTOR OF THE CHRONOBIOLOGY UNIT AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF MENTAL HEALTH MIK GOOD FRIEND LONG TIME FRIEND AND BRILLIANT SCIENTIST SAMERA HATAR WE'LL TELL YOU IT'S A STUPID IDEA IT'S ANTI BIOLOGY AND IT INCREASED CARCRASHES INCRE E'S HARD ATTACKS INCREASE DEPRESSION IT'S JUST IT LIKE KIDS DON'T LIKE TO WAKE UP EARLY ANYWAY PARENTS LIKE TO WAKE UP EARLY SPECIALY A KIDS AS ON'T LIKE WAKE UP EARLY IT MAKES NO SENT AND THEN THERE'S ALL THESE ARGUMENTS ABOUT YOU KNOW IS IT REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO TRUNCATE THE THE THE LATE YOU NOW YOU WANT MORE LIGHT IN THE EVENING SO THERE'S LESS CRIME LIKE THAT'S WHOWELY UNSUBSTANTIATED LIT'S COMPLETELY UN SUBSTANTIATE SO THE DAYLIGHT SAVING THING IS JUST STUPID UM  BASICALLY TRYING GET AS MUCH LIGHT IN YOUR EYES I DEALY FROM SUNLIGHTS SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND BY THE WAY IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT CATORACT UM THAT'S A SERIOUS CONCERN AFTER ALL I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT OUP THEMOLOGY YOU KNOW CATARACT MACULAR DEGENERATION BU GESS WHAT  THE CHAIR OF OPTHEMOLOGY IT FROM STAMPORD WINNK HIME ON THE PODCASTS VERIFY THIS WHEN THE SUN

YOUKNOW YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS AS THE NIGHT GOES ON THE AMOUNT AE GABON MY BRAIN STARTS A DIMINISH AND I JUST KAN GO TO SHORT FOR M WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT PODCASTING IN THE MILL THE NIGHT THAT'S

MOVIES ABOUT THAT RIGHT UM YOU KNOW I WOULD DEAFILY THE WORRY LAST UM YE I WOULD WORRY LESS I WOULD HAVE MORE FUN UH I WOULD I WOULD CERTAINLY UM LUSI I START LATCHING ON TO PRACTICE IS AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE AS A WAY FOR ME WAS KINDLIKE MY WORLD FELT VERY UNSTABLE UM AND FOR ME BROUGHT STABILITY UM BUT YOU WANT O AVOID RIGIDITY SO YOU KNOW DO YOU WANT TO BE THE ONE NINETEEN YEAR OLD HIS LIKE O A GOT TO GET TO SLEEP YOUE NOW GO TO GO BACK TO AT AT EIT THIRTY AT NIGHT NIHT I ENJOY LIFE BUT I WOULD SA UM WHEN YOU'R NINETEEN LEARN HOW YOU LEARN LEARN HOW TO FOCAS LEARN HOW TO

TRESSES BADSRESSES GUS JRUST AS BAD UNLESS YOU'REGETTING ENOUGH SLEEP IN WHICH CASE STRESS IS CALLED LEARNING IN LIFE NOW I VE EE DON'T TO ANYTHING DANGEROUS AVOID PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL DANGER BUT I THNG IS A NINETEEN YEAR OLD I MEAN MIGHT DIRECT ADVICE WOULD BE HAVE SOME CARTIVE ASCULAR ACTIVITY YOU LIKE AVE SOME RESISTANCE TRAINING ACTIVITY YOU LIKE DEVELOP SOME SORT OF SELF AWARENESS PRACTICE LIKE JOURNALING COULD BE MEDITATION UM SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU LIKE OF OID PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE U I MEAN IT SOUND SO STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT THEN WE CAN ALL LOOK INTO OUR PERSONAL HISTORIE LIKE WHT I SPENT ALL THIS TIME TRYING RESOLVE THIS THING THAT LIKELYIT YOU DIDN'T LIKE THEM IT'S SIMPLE A YOU DIDN'T LIKE EM THEY WERN'T INTO CUDDLEFISH OR FERRETS YOU DIDN'T LIKE EM WAS YOUR KOND F PERSON RIGT AND THAT'S NOT A BOX YOU CAN CHECK ON THE DATING APS THEY TELL ME RIGHT THE FARRET THING I THN BE VERY VERY SMALL SUP SET OF PEOPLE UM I THINK YOU KNOW THE KNOW THYSELF THING IS HUGE LEARNT LEARN TO TAP IN TO THAT EARLY FEELING OF LIKE THIS FEELS RIGHT THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT LEARNE TO BE A BIT OF A OF A RUDDER FOR YOURSELF AND UM AN JOURNAL I STILL HAVE STACKS OF THINGS THAT I WROTE CROSS THE YEARS MOST OF IT IS TERRIBLE BUT YOU WILL FIND IF YOU GO BACK THAT YOU KIND AN KNEW BETTER ALL ALONG EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T DO BETTER ALL LONG UM THTHAT VOICE IN YOUR HEAD DON'T DO THAT DO THAT HIS PERSONS LIKE EVERONE ELSE IS CRAZY ABOUT THIS PERSON BUT NOT ME BUT THIS IS LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE I II DONTWANT A SOUND SENTIMENTAL BUT YEV TO YEV TO YET TO FIND YOUR HEART RIGHT OR AT LEAST NOT LOSE IT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE IN TOUCH WITH THAT PIECE OF YOURSELF THAT WASN'N JUDGING AND JUST FELT GOOD AND AS LONSE IS NOT SOMETHING IT SELF DESTRUCTIVE I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND THEN YET HAVE TOOLS AND PRACTICES IND PLACE BECAUSE THEY WORK AND WHENYOU'RE NINETEEN AND YOUR NURL NOR PLASTICITY IS THROUGH THE ROOF YOU YOU CAN DO A LOT LESS AND GET A LOT MORE BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT HITTING TWENTY FIVE AND IT ALL BEING OVER I'M CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT YOU CAN CRAM IN A LOT EARLY ON IS YOU KNOW I STILL REGRET NOT LEARNING AN INSTRUMENT THE DATE ON PEOPLE THAT LEARN AN INSTRUMENT EVEN LATER IN LIFE BUT CERTAINLY AT NINETEEN IS THAT IT GREATLY INCREASES YOUR ABILITY O LEARN ALL SORTS OF THINGS SO LEARN AN INSTRUMENT HOW CAN WE TRANSFORM THE AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE OH SO IN TEN SECONDS SO WHEN UM IN CHARGE JUS THO A LIT WHALL BACK I DID IN INTERVIEW WITH AT WITH A MAJOR MEDIA OUTLET AND THEY WERE VERY GRACIOUS AND AND THEN THEY SAID LIKE WHAT'S NEXT AND IWAS LIKE IMON A RUN FOR SAS LISING THET YOU KNOW I WAS SORT OF AI LOOK IT'S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT BUT FRANKLY I THINK THAT U I'M SO POORLY SUITED FOR THAT IT'S OBVIOUS UM I'M SO POORLY SUITED FOR THAT SO IT WASN'T A JOKE BUT IT WAS YOU N I THINK AS A I SPEND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS LIKE A IF YOU REALLY GO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO DO THAT FOR LIVING AND UM AND UM BUT I AM VERY INTERESTED IN I POTENTIALLY INFORMING POLICY IF I WERE EVER BE ASKED I'D CERTAINLY U RESPOND AND AND MY STANCE ON THIS IS YOU KNOW UM MUCH IN THE SAME VEN AS THE PODCASTPIS KEEP IN MIND THE PODCAS ASLAC SUGGESTED I START ONE BUT IT WAS REALLY DURING THE THE UM THOSE DAYS OF THE THE DEEP TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE PANDEMIC WHERE A BUT BY THE WAY I I WASN'T ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT VAXINE SO I DIDN'T AND ALSO I DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERTISE IN IT SO I WAS NOT A WELL SUITED TO DO IT BUT I ALSO DECIDED IT'S A TOPIC ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT SO MY RESPONSE IN LIFE AND IN GENERAL WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING AS I LIKE WHA GA LOT OF OPINIONS ABOUT THAT BUT THIS IS IN THE VENRROK BUT DURING THE PANDEMIC I REALIZE IT WAS A LOT OF  CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION ANXIETY STRESS MUCH OF THING'S HAPPENING WITH VISUAL SYSTEMS AND BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS THAT I FELT THERE WERE TOOLS THAT THAT PEOPLE COULD A PERHAPS BENEFIT FROM U SO I JUST TART TO PUTTING THAT INFORMATION INTO THE WORLD AND I WAS REALLY SURPRISE REALLY SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE THAT I KNEW FROM THE NERROSCIN'S COMMUNITY FOR INSTANCE AT AND I AM H OR A YOU KNOW IN GOVERNMENT POSITIONS WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF SO I JUST KEPT DOING IT UM AND I THINK THAT IT MADE CLEAR TO ME THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS NOT ONE THING IT'S IT'S TOUGH SPECIAL EN TALING ABOUT KIDS LIKE WHAT TO DO UM IS A TRICKY THING BUT THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN MY MIND SHOULD AT LEAST INVOLVE SOME SORT OF DISCUSSION EARLY ON ABOUT THIS THING CALL THE BRAIN THIS THING CALL THE BODY HOW THEY WORK HOW YOU CAN DO CERTAIN THINGS TO A MODULATE YOUR STRESS LEVEL YOUR SLEEP THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT JUST IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP AND NUTRITION AND AVOIDING SOCIAL ISOLATION AND IN ALL THESE IMPORT THINGS BUT GIVING PEOPLE SOME LEVERS AND NOBS TO TO MANEUVER WITHIN THEMSELVES AND YOU KNOW ZERO COST TOOLS AS A WAY TO DO THAT THAT U TRANSCEND YOU KNOW SOSA O ECONOMIC BOUNDARIES I DEALLY ATTRANCE AND LANGUAGE AS WELL BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT TO TRIE OUT THE UNITED STATES AND OF COURSE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES THERE MANY DIFFERENT A CULTURE SPEAKING DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT A MAND MAYBE A I WILL SOON ALLOW US TO PUT OUT THE PODCAST INTO MUCH YO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES I THINK IT WILL UM SO I THINK THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD START IN MY OPINION WITH IT WITH TEACHING KIDS HOW TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES WHAT TO DO IN DIFFICULT CENAREOS THAT'S REALLY ANCHORED IN IN THE REAL PILLARS OF BIOLOGY AND AN PSYCHOLOGY AND TRYING TO TAKE SOME OF THE MYSTERY OUT OF TRY TO NAVIGATE THAT THE TOUGH BUSINESS OF GROWING UP A I MEAN IF YOU THINK IT'S TOUGH BEING AN ADULT WHICH IT CAN BE CERTAINLY IT'S REALLY TOUGH GROWING UP UM AS WE ALL KNOW AND I THINK THAT MORE TOOLS MORE TOOLS MORE PROTOCOLS MORE TOOLS MORE TOOLS MORE PROTOCOLS MORETOOLS BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIUS A BAST OPINION AND NO ONE'S EVER ASKED ME LIKE HA U WHATCH WE BE TEACHING KIDS BUT IF THEY ASK YOU CAN TELL IE I'M NOT GONG TO SHUT UP SO I THINK THAT WAS OUR LAST QUESTION THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING TO NIGHT I WANT TO FORGIVE ME FOR GOING LONG I DO WANT TO SAY IM THANK YOU SINCERE THANK YOU FOR I MAKE YOUR WAY OUT HERE ESPECIALY ON A WEEK DAY NIGHT THANKS FORYOUR HOSPITALITY UM MY INCREDIBLE TEAM I WANT TO THANK THEM AND UM CERTAINLY LASPE NO AT LEAST THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN SCIENCE

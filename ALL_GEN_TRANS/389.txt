DEGREE SPIN IN THE AIR AS WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER MANEUVERS THAT HAVE REALLY PUSHED THE ENTIRE SPORT FORWARD HE'S ALSO COMPLETELY POPULARIZED THE SPORT THROUGH HIS VIDIO GAME END THROUGH HIS EMBASSADORSHIP FOR SCAPEBOARDING IN FACT FEW IF ANY NAMES ARE A SYNONYMOUS TO ESCAPEBOARDING IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS TONY HAWK AND HE IS OSO DESERVED OF THAT TITLE BECAUSE FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS HE HAS SHOWN UP AS THE CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL HE IS KIND HE IS RESPECTFUL AND HE IS COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO HIS CRAFT AND THAT SHOWS UP IN EVERY ASPECT OF HIS LIFE HE STILL TO THIS DAY SCAPEBOARDS DAILY AND AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN HE RECENTLY SUFFERED A MAJOR INJURY A COMPLETE BREAK OF HIS FEMER THAT IS THE BONE IN HIS UPPER LEG AND THIS IS WHAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER A CAREER ENDING INJURY NOT ONLY DID TONY COME BACK FROM THAT INJURY BUT HE WENT BACK TO THE VERY TRICK ON WHICH HE BROKE HIS FEMER AND RECENTLY COMPLETED THAT TRICK THAT IS A FIVE FORTIER SO CALLED MAC TWIST I MENTION THIS BECAUSE AT EVERY LEVEL OF HIS LIFE TONY HAS DEMONSTRATED HIMSELF TO BE SOMEBODY WITH INCREDIBLE DRIVE INCREDIBLE VISION AND INCREDIBLE PERSISTENCE AND TO DAY WE TALK ABOUT THAT DRIVE VISION AND PERSISTENCE AND WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO SEDAGOAL AND TO CONTINUALLY EVOLVE ONE SCULL AND TO CONTINUALLY PROGRESS AS A BASICALLY YOUNG PRETIN AS A TN AGER AS A YOUNG ADULT AS AN ADULT AND WELL LET'S FACE IT AS A FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN HE IS NOW HEADING A LITTLE BIT PAST MIDDLE AGE ALTHOUGH WE DO HOPE THAT HE LIVES FOREVER TONYHACK A CH A A THE BIRD MAN REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE SUPERHUMAN BUT AS YOU LEARN TO DAY HE IS O SO HUMAN IN THE WAY THAT HE SHARES HIS OWN EXPERIENCE AND SHARES WITH YOU THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN EACH AND ALL LOOK AT WHAT WE DOU AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE AND PUT OUR MINDS IN OUR BODIES TO THOSE GOALS AND ACHIEVE THEM I CONFESS THAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WITH TONY HAWK WAS A PARTICULARLY THRILLING ONE FOR ME TO HAVE I GREW UP IN THE SPORT ESCAPEWOARDING SO I HAD MET TONY PREVIOUSLY ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T REMEMBER IT THOSE MANY YEARS AGO IN FACT I MET HIS PARENTS YOU'LL LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT STORY ON DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE BUT I WAS AWARE OF COURSE OF TONY'S ACCOMPLISHMENTE I WAS ALSO AWARE OF HIS PHILANTHROPY SO HE HAS E SCAPE PART FOUNDATION I ALSO LISTEN TO HIS PODCAST WITH ANOTHER PROFESSIONAL SCAPEORDER JASON ELLIS CALLED HAWK VIRST'S WOLF WE PROVIDED A LINK TO THAT PODCAST IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS AS WELL BUT NEVER BEFORE I HAVE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES SIT DOWN AND TALK TO THE TONY HAWK AND LEARN FROM HIM SO AS ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED TO

DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONCER IS ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLECE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF ELECTROLITES SODIA MAGNESIUM IN PETASSIUM BUT NO SUGAR THE ELECTROLYTES AND HYDRATION ARE ABSOLUTELY KEY FOR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE EVEN A SLIGHT DEGREE OF DEHYDRATION CAN IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO THINK OUR ENERGY LEVELS AND OUR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO ACHIEVE PROPER HYDRATION AND IT DOES SO BY INCLUDING THE THREE ELECTROLITES IN THE EXACT RATIOS THEY NEED TO BE PRESENT I DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP I USUALLY MIX IT WITH ABOUT SIXTEEN TO THIRTY TWO OUNCES OF WATER IF I'M EXERCISING I'LL DRINK ONE WHILE I'M EXERCISING AN I TEND TO DRINK ONE AFTER EXERCISING AS WELL MANY PEOPLE ARE SCARED OFF BY THE IDEA OF INGESTING SODIUM BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO CONSUME SODIUM IN EXCESS HOWEVER FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE AND ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSUMING VERY CLEAN DIETS THAT IS CONSUMING NOT SO MANY PROCESS FOODS OR HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS OFTENTIMES WE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SODIU MAGNESIUM IN PETASSIUM AND WE CAN SUFFER AS A CONSEQUENCE

HAVE THE S CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'VE TRACKED YOUR CAREER FOR A VERY LONG TIME GROW UP IN ESCAPEWORD THING I I KNOW HAD YOUR POSTER ON MY WALL I THINK YOUR NAME IS SYNONYMOUS ESCAPE WORDING AS YOU KNOW I THINK A QUESTION THAT PROBABLY GET ASKED FROM TIME TO TIME BUT WAS JUST CLARIFY THE DATA FROM THE OUTSET TONY HAWK IS YOUR REAL NAME RIGHT YES ANTHONY FRANK HAWK BUT I NEVER WENT BY ANTHONY MY I MA MY PARENTS CALL ME TONY SINCE I COULD REMEMBER IT SO IT'S A FITTING NAME I GIVEN THE SPORT AND WHAT YOU DO AND WE WILL GET INTO THE SELOBIT LATER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FAMILY AND PARENTING AND PARENTS AM BUT I'L ALUDE TO THE STORY NOW THAT A WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD YOUR PARENTS TOOK ME IN YI SLEPT IN YOUR BED IN YOUR HOLLIE WHILE NOT WITH YOU IN IT BUT SURROUNDED BY YOUR A NEAR INFINITE NUMBER OF TROPHIES AND AND A IT MUST HAVE BEEN RIGHT AFTER I MOVED OUT SIS WOULD BE IWAYS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THEY GOUGH TOS TELL AS STORY NOW VERY BRIEFLY I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WAS IT A CONTEST AT LINDEVIS TA BOYS CLUB YEVERYONE LEFT ME IN ANOTHER CAN NAME BILLY WALDMAN A WE'RE STILL THERE YOUR DAD SAID WERE WERE YOU GOING AM IT WAS CLEAR THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING MY LIFE WAS I WAS

RELAS LEV ME THAT TRACT THAT LET OUT IT DOESN'T MY DAD AND AN MY MOB TOGETHER WOULD BE DOING THAT YES INCREDIBLE PEOPLE A AND WE'L GET BACK TO THAT STORY LATER BECAUSE YOU AND I ACTUALLY MET A THE NEXT DAY IN FALBROCK AT YOUR RANT BUT A FABS A HADAT AN EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN TO SAY OMANTO SAY EIGHTY NINE LOOK AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE EITHER ENESSAY OR CASTLE CONTEST YOUNG THAT YOUR DAD WAS VERY ACTIVE IN BUT WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT BUT AI HAVE SO M ANY QUESTIONS THAT RELATE TO SCAPEWARDING TO YOU AND REALLY AS A NERROW SCIENTIST TO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF A LIFE OF CONTINUAL PROGRESSION BECAUSE WET THER RE NOT PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS AND WATCHING THIS OR SCAPE ORDERS OR NOT AND I IMAGINE THAT MOST OF THEM OR NOT IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS CAME A VERY LONG TIME AND THAT YOU'E SOMEHOW MANAGE TO CONTINUED TO PROGRESS OVER AND OVER TO COME BACK FROM VERY SEVERE INJURIES AND SOMEHOW KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER SO THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS ABOUT THE YOUNGER VERSION OF YOU IM DID YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF SELF CONCEPT LIKE YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE A PROATHLETE OR I WANT TO BE ESCAPEORDER OR I WANT HAVE A VIDIO GAME NAMED AFTER MII EXACTLY A YOU KNOW BUT IF YOU CAN THINK BACK TO MAYBE EVEN PREESCAPEWORDING DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOUR SELF CONCEPT WAS YOU KNOW THIS NOTION OF LIKE I'M IV AA SELF AND I'M EITHER SIMILAR A DIFFERENT TO YER KIS A SOMEWAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG I WAS PUT IN A LOT OF ADVANCE CLASSES AND NOT THAT THAT FELT LIK COULD BADGE OF HONOR I FELT MORE LIKE I WAS JUST CLASSIFIED AS A NURRD BUT THEN I THOUGHT O CAABLE THAT'S MY STRENGTH SO I'LL LEAN INTO THAT AND AND I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE I WOULD BE A TEACHER CAUSE I VEOUT ABIT I GET ALL THESE CONCEPTS AND I THINK I COULD RELATE THEM TO KIDS OR TO TO MY PEERS I BECAUSE I HELPED LOT OF MY CLASSMATES THROUGH SOME SOME CLASSES I SO THAT'S ALL I REALLY HAD I DIDN'T KNOW AND THEN WHEN I WOULD PLACE FORITS I WOULD I WOULD BE O KE YOU KNOW WASN'T I WASN'T TERRIBLE BUT I WASN'T THE I P THN  P AND SO I WAS JUST KIND OF PLAIN BASKABALL PLAN I BASEBALL IM AND THEN WHEN I FOUND SCAPEBOARDING I MEAN IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT I WAS WHAT I WANT TO DO IT WAS ONCE ONCE I GOT ON A SCAPEBOARD AND REALIZED THAT I COULD MANEUVER IT AND DO THINGS THAT WERE UNIQUE AND NOT THEYRE MOVING THE NEEDLE OR ANY ONE CARRIAD BUT THEY WERE UNIQUE IN THE SENTS LIE GIDN'T I NEVER SEEM ON DO THIS AND THIS FEELS AWSOM AND SO I JUST ONE TO THIS AND SO I DIDN'T THINK THAT THIS IS MY CAREER I WAS TEN SUCH SLETONS THIS WAS MY ESS THIS IS MY HOBBY ITHIS MY THINK UH AND I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THESE LARSPORTS ANYMORE DID YOU STOP PLAYING ALL THE OTHERS YES I I QUIT I QUIT LITTLE LIG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON WHEN MY DAD HAD BEEN APPOINTED PRESIDENT OF THAT CHAPTER OF LITTLE LEAGUE BECAUSE HE WAS THE COACH HE WAS ALWAYS VERY INBALVED IN ALL THIS KIDS I HAVE THREE SIVILINGS SO HE WAS ALWAYS VERY SUPPORT OF WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING AND THEN WHEN I WAS PLAYING BASEBALL HE BECAME A COACH CAUSE HE HAD TIME AND HE WAS DOING THAT E AS HE WAS BEING ALMOST RETIRED UH AND THEN HE WAS SUCH A PROMINENT FIGURE IN THE LITTLE LIG THEY SAID OL YOUR PRESIDENT NOW AND SO THEN SOME ONE ELSE WAS COACH AND THEN I WAS SCATING AND I WAS OVER IT DID YOU IMMEDIATELY START ESCAPE WOARDING IN THE PARKS ON TRANSITION AS OIN OR WHORTER WERE YOU PUSHING ROUND IN THE DRIWAY I MUSTKIDS IT WAS I WAS TRANSPORTATION AND SCATING WAS KIND OF A FAT SO I STARTED IN SEVENTY EIGHT ROUGHLY MAY BE SEVENTY SEVENTEVEN AND IT WAS KIND OF A FAD SO KIDS JIS HAD SCAPEBOARDS AND THEY WOULD THEY WOULD ALL CRUISE ROUN YOU DON'T LIKE IT WAS A SEVENTY SO EVERYONE HAD O BITE RIGHT AND YOU KNEW WHEREVER ALL THE KIDSBERG HAS THE BIKESFR ON THE FRONT ONE AND THEN AT SOME POINT THAT KIND OF TURNED INTO SCATING SO EVERYONE HAD SCAPEWORT THEY WERE ALL LIKE SHID HE UNO A JASE PENNY OR BIG BOX STORED SCAPEBOARDS NO ONE HAD REALLY GOOD ONE NOT MIRA UH BUT THEN AT SOME POINT WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT HIS MAGAZINES OF PEOPLE SKATING AND EVERYONE SCETTING IN POOLS CAUSE THAT WAS THE DOG TOMAN ZEABOYS THERE I NWAS LIKE CASE WERE FLYING I WANTERED  WHERE DO WE DO THAT AND THE E SCAPE ARK GOBUT UP IN SINT IEGO AH NON MAR SCAPER I SCAPE WAYSRS O CNWEAWAYS ESCAPE ARK WAS THE FIRST ONE IN AURRIA I CALLY I TAKE THAT BACK SPRING VALLEY WAS THE FIRST CAPE PART I TRIED TO GO THERE AND I WAS NINE AND YOU HAD TO BE TEN AND I REMEMBER LIKE STATING IN THE PARGONAL LOOVING OVER THE FENCE AN MY DAD DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT THEY CAUSE MY DAUBT WOULD EASILY LIED FOR ME BUT HE DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WAS AN AGE LEMENT TAS HOLD AS HE NINE OSARRY CAN'T COME AND THEN THEY CLOSED NOT LONG AFTER SO WHEN I NEVER GOT SCAPESPRING BELLIY UM CAUSE I I THINK OF YOU AS SYNONYMOUS WOULD DELL MAR SCATE WRENCH SHORT WEL THAT WAS THAT CAME LATER BECAUSE AWAYST ESCAPE PART WAS OPEN THAT SO THIS WAS WHEN I FIRST ONE WAS LIKE SEVENTY EIGHT I A FRIEND OF MINE WAS GOING YOU SAID I WONE TO GO TO THE SCAPEPARK SO I HAD TO GO GET YOU KNOW IS SUCH A HOSTL LIKE I HAD TO GO GET THE AUTHORIZATION FORM I HAD TO GET NOTERIZED BY THE BANK FOR MY PARENTS LIKE TO GO THERE AND THEN I WENT AND IT WAS THAT WAS MY PIFANY WHEN I FIRST SAW PEOPLE FLYING AROUND IN PERSON I WAS LIKE THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING FOR AS LONG AS I COULD POSSIBLY DO IT CAUSE IT LOOKED IT LOOKED LIKE MAGIC IT REALLY DID LOOK LIKE THERE WERE FLYING ON MAGIC CARPETS AND AND IT SPOKE TO ME IN THE SENSE OF BEING A DARE DEVIL BUT ALSO DOING IT INDIVIDUALLY NOT RELYING ON MY TEAM NOT IM GETTING  GETTING HOSSTEL BY A COACH IT WAS JUST LIKE OH I COULD BE PART OF THE SCENE BUT DO MY OWN WAY AND THEN I I SCATED AWAYS IS AS MUCH AS I COULD AS WHENEVER HE RIDES THERE AND UM THEN MY PARENTS MOVE TO NORTH COUNTY SINT NIEGO WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL UM MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST CHASING KIND OF REAL ESTATE DEALS AND I AN ND SO I GOT LUCKY THAT DOL MAR SCATE RANCH WAS RIGHT THERE EVERY OTHER PARK CLOSHED THE DOMMARSCAPE RANCH REMAINED UPEN SO MEAN THERE WAS A BIT OF LUCK TO ALL THAT AND NEW IS BASED ON GEOGRAPHY YOUR DAD'S INVOLVEMENT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE I GOT IN ESCAPE WOARDING BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY DAD WASN'T AROUND THAT MUCH AT THAT TIME A LOTTI ISCATTING ESCAPE WORIM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REQUIRE PARENT INVOLVEMENT WAS IT UNUSUAL TO HAVE PARENTAL ENVOVOMENT AT THAT STAGE YE I MEAN I REMEMBER FRANK AND BY THE WAY I REMEMBER FRANK AND NANCY YOUR PARENTS WITHWICH WITH SUCH FONDNESS NOT JUST CAUSE THY TOOK ME IN BUT I REMEMBER THINKING LIKE THER THEY WERE AT TIMES THE ONLY POINT OF STABILITY IN A LANDSCAPE OF LIK TO HUNDRED PEOPLE WHERE AS YOU KNOW THER BE POTENTIAL CHAOSIPIN O TIME OAND YOUR DAD HAD THIS WAY OF MOVING ABOUT LIKE HE WASN'T AFRAID I RECALL THAT HE WASN'T AFRAID TO SAY WHAT HE THOUGHT LIKE HAG DON'T DO THAT LIKE IMPOSED SOME REGULATION YET CONTEST AND AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMLY ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS A SPORT UNLIKE OTHER SPORTS LIKE YOUR KNOCK IN A REGULATY KIT'S LIKE ME AT THE TIME OR A YOU NOCAN TRYNK CONTROL PEOPLE SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO HAVE YOUR DAD INVOLVED AND THE REASON I ASK IS THAT YOUR APPARENT WILL TALK MORE ABOUT PARENTING BUT ALSO IT SEEMS THAT HE WENT FROM SAYING OK U A LITTLE LEAGUE OTHER SPORTS WHICH IS MORE TYPICAL TO OKA THIS KIND OF UNUSUAL SPORT SCAPEBOARTING BUT YOUR MERE INTEREST IN IT WAS ENOUGH TO GET HIM EXCITED OR MOTIVE ENOUGH TO TAKE YOU AROUND TO THESE PLACES THAT'S PRETTY SPECIAL AND THAT'S PRETTYM WAS I MEAN  IN IN THAT RESPECT IT WAS GREAT TO HAVE HIS SUPPORT AND AND TO RELY ON HIM FOR THAT THE FACT THAT HE WAS ALWAYS AROUNDED HE WAS IN CHARGE OF A LOT OF THE EVENTS THA THOUT THAT SUCKED BECAUSE BECAUSE HET JUST MARKED ME AH AS ONE BEING FAVORITED AH AND SPOILED AH AND AND MOST O MY FRIENDS THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T WANT THEM SKATTING SO EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE STOKE THAT MY DAD HA WAS WAS DOING THIS KIND OF THING AND GIVING THAT KIND OF SUPPORT THEY STILL WERE LIKE YOUR DABS HERE THIS IS OUR THING THIS IS OUR SCENE THIS IS OUR GET AWAY FROM OUR PARENTS I I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE IN THE MATTER I DID I DID AT SOME POINT TELL HIM MY MY CONCERNS AND MY  FRUSTRATIONS WITH IT BUT HE D IMENLY WONT O HEAR IT N HE WAS HE WAS VERY MUCH STEADFAST LIKE WHILE M BEEN COMING THIS FAR LIKE YOU CAN WE CAN KEEP OUR DISTANCE AT THESE EVENTS BUT PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON ME TO ORGANIZE THEM AND SO I DECIDE TO SUCK IT UP FOR WHILE DID IT PUSH YOU HARDER I YOU NOUGH YOU COULD PROVE YOURSELF WITH ARM WORDIN THEY INDEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YANAS A FAVORITISM IS ULTIMATELY I YOU CAN'T FAKE YOU CAN'T FAKE ESCAPE RIGHT RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S NO DEEP FAKE VERSION ANOV ESCAPE ERE NO YOU KNOW YOU EITHER CAN DO IT OR YOU CAN'T DO IT AND IT'S SHOWN IN REAL TIME SO UM AND I SUPPOSE BACK THEN I RECALL YOU WERE REQUITE A BIT SKINNY YOUR SKINNYN AROYA O I HAD I HAD ALL KINDS OF THINGS GOING AGAINST ME UT THIT'S  YE I MEAN I DON'T THINK PEOPLE L REALIZE TUS UNLESS THEY MET YOU IN PERSON BUT NOW IT IS THEIR FEW TALLER ESCAPE ORDERS OUT THERE TO THE SPORTS GROWN SO MUCH UM BUT YOU'RE PRETTY TALL YOU SIX SIX THREE BUT I WAS NOT WHEN I WAS DRAWN WHEN I WAS THAT AGE I WAS VERY SMALL UM AND KIND OF CONCERNINGLY SMALL BECAUSE BY THE TIME I GOT TO BE SIXTEEN I WAS STILL I LOOK LIKE I WAS THIRTEEN I USE TO GET PULLED OVER I LITERALLY LIKE I HAD A CAR THAT I BOUGHT WITH MY EARNINGS AT A HONTACIVIC NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN  M C C AND I WOULD GET PULLED OVER AND THEN THE COPS WOULD BE LIKE I HOW OLDER YOU SIXTEEN WILL YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WERE THIRTEEN BACK THERE UM AND THEND I SHOT UP AROUND AGE SEVENTEEN SO THAT'S INTERESTING AND WE CAN GET BACK TO THIS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOURE ALMOST REMARKABLE LEVELS OF ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM PHYSICAL INJURIES BECAUSE UM WELL YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT A BY ALLOBJICAL THEORY HERE WHICH HIS AT THE OTHER LOPULAR STUDY LONGEVITY AND PERHAPS THE FASTEST RATE OF AGING THAT WE EVER UNDERGO IS PUBERTY RIG IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT GAN BEFORE PUBERTA KID AFTERBRUSLY DIFFERENT HUMAN BEING PSYCHOLOGICALLY OFTEN PHYSICALLY AS WELL SOME PEOPLE HAVE A LONGER ARK OF PUBERTY THAN OTHERS AND THAT DOES SEEM TO CORRELATE WITH A LONGER LIFE AND SO IT'S DON OF INTERESTING LY O SOME GETS IT PUBERTY AND THEY GO THROUGH ALL THE MARKERS OF PUBERTY IN LIKE ONE SUMMER I OTHE KIDS IT'S VERY VERY LONG AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE DONOT TO TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU HIP PUBERTY AND THE OTHER MARKERS BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUARE GROW SPER OCCURRED LATE OH THAT'S A TERRIFIC MARKER OF A LONG LIFE BY THE WAY BECAUSE WHAT IT REFLECTS IS THE ONSET OF A BIG BURST OF GROWTH HARMONE OUT OF THE PATUITARY AND E BRAIN AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO GROW FOR A LONG PERIT OF TIME THAT INDICATES YOU DON'T GIVE HEEL ITTLE BIT OF THE SLOPE OF H LINE SOME EXCENTS OH YESO IM THIS THIS MAY UM HAVE IMPORTANT AND FORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES SO IT' SEVENTEEN YOU SHOT UP IN MY CORRECT IN REMEMBERING A MAYBE YOU SAID IT MAY BE SOMEBODY ELSE DID THAT YOU WERE UM FORGIVE ME BUT SO SKINNY WHEN YOU WERE A KID THAT YOU ACTUALLY WOR ELBOW PADS IS  YET Y THAT'S A TRUE THAT'S A JATHORI FER SURE AND AND I TOOK INSPIRATION FROM OTHERS THAT THAT I IDENTIFIED WITH NAMELY STEVE CAVALLERO BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY AN ESTABLISHED PRO WHEN I STARTED TO COME UP IN THE RANKS ARE GETTAN GET NOTICED AT ALL AND HE WAS WEARING ELLOW PADS ON HIS KNEES IN THIS FULL PAGE PICTURE OF HIM IN WINCHESTER GUNABACKATAR AND I WAS LIKE THAT I WANT TO DO THAT AND HE'S SMALL AND I FEEL LIKE THAT'S MY GOAL AND AND WHY YES STAY LIKE IF HE CAN DO THAT I CAN DO ITOS IS MORE LIKE OH THIS I IDENTIFY WITH THAT AND AND THAT GIVES ME HOPE UM AND AS I RECALL STEVIE ALSO AS A PRETTY SEVERE SCOLIOSIS R I WHY THONT OUIUST WHAT HE HAS YE ONE POIN HE WAS TURNED IT TURNED PRETTY PRETTY TAYA TO THE WRITER LEFT I DON'T RECALL WHAT ME STILL INCREDIBLE SCAPE WHATER LOVES YEV ME HE'S A NOR CALGUY SO O WHATEVER HE HAD IS FROM BIRTH BUT UM BUT IT WAS MORE THAT THAT HIS SIZE AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS MAN'T NOT MANY BUT NI SICK FOUR YEARS OLD WIN ME UM SO I JUST AS LIKE O THERE'S SMALL GUISE DOING THAT IC I CAN DO IT MAYBE BUT WHEN I GOT TALL WHEN I WENT THROUGH HURINY SUDDENLY I HAD ALWAYS TRICKS AND THEN SUDDENLY I HAD THE STRENGTH AND THE THE HEIGHTS THAT GAVE ME CONFIDENCE AND SO LL WAS SAID IT WAS LIKE AL I CAN GO WAY HIGHER NOW AND I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THESE TRICKS THES INTRICATE BOARD MANEUVERS AN STUFF SO THAT WAS A HUGE ADVANTAGE TO ME UM THE THE SMALLER STUFF FELT DIFFERENT AFTER THAT WHICH WAS HARDER UM BUT BEING HALD TO BLAST EIGHTY IN THE AIROUS AWAS A FOR FEET NEAR WAS A HUGE ADVANTE YET ISN'T THAT WILD WHEN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM KNOWS HOW TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN YOUR BODY CHANGES AND YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING BUT WITH SO MUCH MORE VOICE EVEN THE BOLLS LOOKED SMALLER WHEN I WOULD STAND ON TOPINA LIK WAY THIS ISN'T THAT BIG WILD WHELL THE REASON I ASK ABOUT THIS I THINK YOU NON PEOPLE LISTENING GENERALLY SEEMED TO ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU BECOME A STAND FOR PROFESSOR BECOME PROFESSIONAL SCAPE ORDER OR YOU FESSIONAL SOCRAPLAYER THAT THAT YOU WERE JUST FATED TO BECOME THAT RIGHT IN IS CLEAR THAT IT'S THE CONFLUENCE OF SO MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS UM BUT ONE OF THE CONSISTENT FACTORS FOR SURE IS A SENSE HE JUS REALLY LOVE DOING IT RIGHT I MEAN I CAN'T  MAGINE GETTING YOU KNOWST PROFICIENT OR EXCELLENT AT ANYTHING WITHOUT LOVING DOING IT RIGHT AND SO STILL AT THIS TIME WHEN YOU WERE TO SAY I'M FOURTEEN FIFTEEN UM DID YOU HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF YOU KNOW WHENEVER PROMODE AL I'M GOIN OF NONE OF THAT WELL THERE WAS THERE WAS NONE OF THAT TO BE HAD SO WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE GREAT ASPIRATIONS BECAUSE NO ONE HAD REALLY DONE THAT BEFORE THERE WERE YOU COULD HAVE SOME SUCCESS YES YOU COULD HAVE MAYBE A SIGNATURE MODEL BUT EVEN THE TOP SAILS OF SCAPEBOARDING THEN WASN'T A CREER THE PRIZE MONEY WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR T FIRST PLACE A HUNDRED FOR SECOND FIFTY FOR THIRD COUPLE TANKS AGASP SOME FOOD YESO WAS PUT I THIS WAY I TURNED PRO AN OWS FOURTEEN BY THE TIME I WAS FIFTEEN AND A HALF AND I HAD A LEARNEST PERMIT AND I COULD DRIVE A A SCHOOTER YOU KNOW I HAD SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS MY BANK ACCOUNT AND I USED THAT TO BUY MAHANDA EXPRESS A MOBET FOR A YEAR AND A HALF THAT WAS MY EARNINGS WAS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS SO CLEARLY MONEY WASN'T THE A THE DOPOMIN HIT IT WAS THE IT WAS THE ACTUAL ESCAPE SURE END IT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN THOUGH THERE WASN'T THERE WAS NO GOAL OF THAT BECAUSE IT JUST DIDN'T EXIST SO I D I DIDN'T CARE LIKE I GETTING I I HAD MY OWN VEHICLE AT AGE FIFTEEN LIKE I WAS LIVING LARGE I CAN GET T THE SCAPEWORK ON MY OWN THAT WAS AMAZING TO BE FOURTEEN AND BE A PROFESSIONAL AT ANYTHING MUST BE UM A A TRIP SO TO SPEAK UM BUT WHAT I'M

MORE PRI FRL THAN OTHERS UM BAT ABOUT SIX SEVEN A COR GUISES UM IN THE VARIOUS VIDIOS I MEAN YYES WERE FAMOUS RIGHT YOU POSTERS AM ON GINS WALLS WHO SCAPEWOARDED THERE WAS A SECOND OR MAYBEIT WAS A THIRD SURGE OF POPULARITY IN SCAPEBOARDING UM BECAUSE IT WOULD SOR SURGEON GENERAL POPULARITY THEN DISAPPEAR AND COME BACK AS IT HAS OVER TACASES KEEPS COMING IN GOING OM TO SOME EXTENT DID YOU HAVE A CONSCIOUS A WARINESS OF JUST HOW YOU KNOW HOW MUCH A TEND TION WAS BEING PLACED ON YE PHOTOS OF YIEW VIDIOS OF YOU AND I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE YOUNGER VERSION OF YOU WHETHER NOT YOU KNOW YOU REALIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE YOU'VE ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME SOMEBODY WHO THROUGH INTERVIEWS THROUGHVIDIOS THROUGH OUR INTERACTIONS AND FOR THOSE HAVE KNOWN YOU MUCH LONGER THAN I HAVE IM JUST VERY GROUNDED I NOT CAUGHT UP IN IT IUM YOU KNOW WE'VE NEVER SEEN HEADLINES ABOUT YOU GIND OF JISTEN A BLOWING ALL YOUR MONEY ERE YOU NAV RECKIN CARS AND YOU NO DESTROYING YOUR

O I I WELL I THINK IT WAS THAT I DIDN'T NEVER I NEVER THAT WAS NEVER A GOAL IND THEN WHEN I HAD A SENSE OF IT I WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE I MEAN I WAS HAPPY I WAS HAPPY TO BE SUCCESSFUL I WAS HAPPY THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZED ME THAT HI WAS AMAZING JUST BECAUSE I WAS GOOD ESCAPE WORNING I NEVER IMAGINED SOMETHING LIKE THAT IM AND BUT I WAS ALWAYS VERY I MEAN SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT I WAS SORT OF I ALMOST LIKE POMPOUS OR ARROGANT BECAUSE I WASN'T INTERACTING BECAUSE I WAS JUST I WAS WALLED OFF AS IE  I NOW WHAT TO DO ON'T COSHLAYSE TAT THIS ISE LOOK LAST WORDS I WOULD EVER USE TO DESCRIBE YOU I THINK

HE WAS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER KID THERE AT SOME LEVEL AND THEN A LOT OF THE KIDS THAT GOT TEASED EARLY ON THEY STUCK WITH IT FIVE YEARS LATER I'M SEENGING THEM IN THE MAGAZINES AND I THINK ABOUT THIS WITH PODCASTING TOO THERE BEEN SOME PODCASTERS THAT AVE REACHED OUT EARLY ON AND HAD QUESTIONS HE OEW LOOK AT THEIR STUFF AND YOU ONCE INITIAL IMPRESSION CAN BE LIKE I WONER LANK WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE AND THEN YOU JUST SEE THEM TWO YEARS LATER THREE YEARS LATER AND THE'RE DOING AMAZINGLY WELL ANDYOUR LIKE THIS SGYRE GALLS HERE FOR GOOD THEY'RE GOIN THEY'RE PROBLY ME TOP OF THE GAME AN IF YOUR E NEVER COUNT ANYBODY OUT WHEN YOU WOULD GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT IN THAT YOU'RE A WERE YOU LIKE LAYING ON THE PILLOWGOING I HOMACAD EOPLE HATE ME THEIR STUFF IN THE MAGAZINES I GOT TA PUSH HARDER THIS IS HARD DID YOU TALK YOUR DAT ABOUT IT I MEAN AGAIN IT'S A LOT TO BEAR R EVEN AS AN ADULT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BEAR AS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID I DIDN'TREALLY HAVE US FOR HO KNOW OR ANY RESOURCE TO TO VOICE THOSE CONCERNS UM I JUST KNEW I WANT TO KEEP GETTING BETTER THAT WAS IT AND SO IF ANYTHING IF I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THOSE VOICES FOR I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE WHATEVER TAKE PEOPLE HAD ON ME I KNEW I WAS GING TO GO BACK TO THE SCAPE PARK AND LEARNED MORE TRICKS UM AND IT'S SOME POINE I HAD SO MUCH OF THAT AS A FOUNDATION THAT IT WAS SORT OF UNDENIABLE THAT LIKE WELE HE CAN DO ALL THE STUFF AND HE ISN'T DOESN'T JUST DO IT AT HIS HOME PART UM AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHEN THE TIDE TURNED FOR ME IS WHEN WHEN I STARTED TO DO WELL AT OTHER EVENTS UM NAMELY UPLIN PIPE LINE WHICH WAS FOR THE MOST PART THE MOST FRIGHTENING POOL THAT WE COULD WRIDE THE THING WAS BIG BUT I ALSO RECALL LIKE THE E HIPS AS THEY'RE CALLED LIKE THE TRANSITIONS AWAY THEY NA SHOP WE IT WAS SUPERTIGHT LOT OF ER GIANT COPING SUPER ROUGH LIKE IF YOU FELL AND UPLIN YOU'RE GETTING SHOOTD UP IT'S PULLING YOUR NEEW POUDS DOWN I DIDN'T KNOW THAT CAS FROM THE PHOTOES I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT OH I WAS IT WAS TREACHEROUS ET REALLY WAS LIKE IT WAS IN AND I WANTED TO DO WELL AT THE EVANT AND I WOULD DRIVE UP THERE EVERY WEEK AND MIKE MY FRIEND A  GREAKESMITH WAS A FREESTOLER BUT HE LIVED NEAR UPLIN AND SO O I WOULD GO TRYV FRIDAY AFTER SCHOOL STRAIGHTS UP ON SKAY TA NIGHT SKATE SATURDAY ALL DAY SKATE SUNDAY A EARLY AND THEN DRIVE ON UM CLE SENIEGO AND I JUST MADE OF MY MISSIONS AN TO FIGURE THAT THING OUT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE PROVING GROUND FOR ME U AM ID SO IF I COULD SAY THAT I  GOSGETTY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING AG ONE DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEY'R SPONSERING THE POD CAST AG ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT'S DESIGNED TO ME ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIAN NEEDS OF COURSE I TRY TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF VITEMENS AND MINERALS THROUGH WHOLE FOOD SOURCES THAT INCLUDE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS EVERY DAY BUT OFTENTIMES I SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH SERVINGS BUT WITH AG ONE I'M SURE TO GET ENOUGH VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED AND IT ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTIGENCE TO HELP BUFFER STRESS SIMPLY PUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I TAKE AG ONE I HAVE MORE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND I SLEEP BETTER AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO

SLASH HUBERMEN YOU CAN CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF TEN FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUTS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO SO IT'S CLEAR YOU HAD ENORMOUS DRIVE LET THE STRUCK A LOOF IT ABOUT UM THE PROCESS OF TRYING TRICKS THE ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH IT DID YOU DID YOU AND DO YOU HAVE A SOR SYSTEMATIC PROCESS WAS IT YOU KNOW A IVEN A LEARN THE BASICS FIRST LIKE DID YOU SAY THAT DO YOU SAY I'M OKAM IN A LEARN'T HAD TO STUFF YOU KNOW AT COPING LEVEL THEN I'M A DO LITTLE AIR THAN WE O GO BIGGER MU DO THIS WERE UM DID YOU JUST SORT OF AM TRY WHAT YOU WANTED TO TRY AND YE OBVIOUSLY WERN'T HAPHAZARD ABOUT IT THE COUT IT SEEMS YOUR PRETTY SYSTEMATIC ABOUT EXPLOR ING WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND THEN PUSHING FORWARD ALITTLE BY LITTLE BUT UM THAT MAY BE COULD TALK ALITTE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU HAVE CONCEPTIONA I SIL CAKE TO MORROW WHEN I TRY THIS UM IT COMES IN DIFFERENT FORMS BUT FOR THE MOST PART I THINK ABOUT HOW I COULD COMBINE EXISTING TRICKS AND WOULD THIS TRICK WORK GOING INTO THIS TRICK AND COULD YOUR BODY POSITION SHIFT OR WOULD IT ALL WORK IN UNISON AND WHEN I APPROACH A NEW TRICK I'M SAY I'M SAYING MORE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS MY THOUGHT PROCESS IS I HAVE ALL THE PIECES TO THIS I'VE DONE EVERY BIT OF IT I'VE DONE THAT I'VE DONE THE FIRST PART OF THE TRICK IN ANOTHER FORM I'VE DONE THE SECOND PART OR THE GRINDING OF IT OR WHATEVER USUALLY IN SOME OTHER BASIC WAY AND THEN THE LANDING IS WHILE THE LANDING IS FROM WHATEVER THAT IS AND IF YOU CAN THROW ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND MAKE THE TIMING WORK IT'S GOING TO WORK AND I NEVER I NEVER WENT AT SOMETHING WITH SOME HAPHOT HAZARD APPROACH OR THROWING CAUTION OF THE WIND LIKE HOPELESS SEE WHAT HAPPENS IT'S ALWAYS VERY MUCH LIKE I KNOW I HAVE ALL THESE THINGS AND SO I JUST HAVE TO PUT HIM TOGETHER AND I MEAN NOW THINGS ARE SO TECHNICAL THAT MY SAME APPROACH THAT I'M DOING HUNDREDS OF TIMES ONE OF HEM JUST WORKS AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T IT'S NOT BECAUSE I COMMITTED TO THAT ONE IT'S BECAUSE OF SOME TINY FRACTIONAL ADJUSTMENT THAT HAPPENED THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HAPPEN AND IT JUST WORK AND AND THAT KIND OF IS THE CURSE OF WHAT TRICKS ARE NOW CAUSE THERE AR PLANY OF MOVES THAT I'VE DONE OVER LAST TEN YEARS EVEN THAT I ONLY JU WANCE CAUSE IT WAS TOO FUCK AND HARD TO GET TO AND I DIDN'T LEARN FROM THAT ONE MAKE AND THAT THAT IS THAT'S HARD TO ACCEPT CAUSE IN THE PAST I WAS LEARNING TRICKS TO HAVE THEM IN MY ARSENAL THAT I COUN JUST THROW HIM DOWN AT A COMPETITION OR A DEMA I'VE GOT THEM O MY POCKET THESE DAYS LIKE THAT TRICK FOR INSTANCE I DID A A DE THREE SIXTY SHOVE IT FIVE ODIFAKY I HAS TO LET'S BREAK THAT TI HAVE REL THREE SE TO SHOVE IT SO BUT WHO SEEM TO TAKE THIS ON I'LL LET YOU TAKE THIS ON I CONTRIVE FOR MY KNOWLEDGE AND PIRST BACTOD BAARA IT WIL WILL WILL YOU SIXTY SHOVE IT IS PUSHING THE BOARD WITH YOUR FEET AND LETTING IT SPIN A FULL THREE SIXTY ROTATION UNDER YOUR FEET AND A LANDING BACK ON IT IT'S IT'S A TRICK THAT PEOPLE DO ON USING ON FLACKGROUND I'VE LEARNED I'VE LEARNED TO DO IT UP ON THE VERT WALLS LIKE I CAN DO THREE SIXTY SHOVE ITS KIND OF IN THE AIR BUT I'M DOING THAT I'M DOING IT THROGH STY SHOVE IT AND I'M LANDING ON MY TRUCK RIGHT LIKE THE AXOLE BETWEEN THE WE ALL HUNG AT ONE AXL AND A WHAT WE CALL FIVE OLD POSITION WHICH IS BASELY A WHEELY ON THE TRUCK SO EVERYTHING IS SO PRECISE I GOT DO THROGH SIXTY SHOVE IT EXACTLY A CERTAIN SPOT ON THE WALL I'VE GOT TA CATCH IT SO THAT IT MIGHT TRUCK LANDS WHEN MY FOOT HITS IT I CAN'T PUSH IT INTO THE TRUCK CAUSE THAT THAT SCREWS UP MY BALANCE SO IT HAS TO LAND ON THE TRUCK I HAVE TO LAND WITH MY WAIGHT PERFECTLY SET BACK ENOUGH THAT I CAN COME IN BACKWARDS BECAUSE I'M DOING THIS TRICK AND AND I'M I'M GUIN COME IN FAKY RIGHT THREE SIXTY SHOVE FIVE O TO COMING AN FORWARD IS AS A WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST THAT THAT I CAN PROBABLY DO THAT JUST IN A FEW TRIES BUT THE IDEA THAT I HAVE TO LAND ON THIS THING BALANCE ON IT LIKE A TEETER TOTTER AND THEN REVERSE MY ENERGY AND COME IN BFAKY BACKWARD IT'S A SO HARD IT'S SO HARD TO TO GET IN TO THE RIGHT POSITION SO LIKE ANY TIME I TRY IT THERE'S LIKE A ONE INTEN CHANCE I'M EVENGING TO GET INTO THE POSITION I NEED AND THAT'S THE ONE I HAVE TO COMMIT TO SO EVERY TIME I DO IT IT SO INTENSE AND IT TAKES SO MUCH SO MUCH COMMENTMENT AND AND SO MUCH A MIND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT LIKE THE THE THAT YOU HAVE SHUT EVERYTHING ELSE OUT EXCEPT THIS ONE MOMENT AND THIS ONE FRACTIONOL PIECE THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE WORK AND IT I'VE DONE AT ONCE I LIKE I WOULD LOVE TO DO IT AGAIN BUT I KNOW WHAT IS GOING O SGIN TO TAKE THE SAME ON EFFORT I DIDN'T LEARN FROM THAT ONE THAT I MADE SOME TRICK THAT MAKES IT OUPEN EVERY TIME IT'S ALL SO TECTICAL ANDTHERE SO MANY THINGS CAN GO WRONG THAT ALL AYS EXCEPT THAT I' KAGN AT ONCE IN THINK ABOUT THE THRESYSY SHOT IT FIVE OFAKI YAH WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THOUGHT OF THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU DECIDE THAT DAY DO YOU EVER USE VISUALIZATION IF YOU EVER HAD I'M LEARNING COME TO YOU IN A DREAM OR FIND THAT YOU TRY TRY TRYE SOMETHING WHENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT NEXT DAY MADE IT ANYTHING LIKE THAT YES SOMETIMES I'LL WAKE U  MILL NIGHT AND I'LL WRITE DOWN SOMETHING CAUSE I OTHERS THIS TRICK OH I THINK I COULD DO THAT YE I'LL GET ME RI DO SO YOU DREAM ABOUT SCAPE WORDING FROM TIME TO TIME YE WELL YE THAT AS SHIFTED A BIT AFTER I GOT HURT BUT YE I USED TO DREAM THAT I CAN'T SCAPE LIKE I'M TRYING AND TIT IT FEELS LIKE THE RAMPS MADE A CARPET I CAN'T GET THE SPEED I CAN'T GET THE TIMING AND THEN AS I WENT THROUGH THIS TRAMATIC INJURY MY DREAMS SHIFTED TOU WHILE I CAN'T SCAPE I CAN DO ALL MY TRICKS AGAIN OH INTERESTING YE A LITTLE A PIECE OF SCIENCE AROUND THEY CAN'T AH CAN'T SCAPE PIECE OR WHEN PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEIR BOLTED DOWN IN A DREAM OR THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY YE THERE'S THIS ONE FACE OF SLEEP CALLED RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP WHERE THE BRAIN IS VERY ACTIVE THE DREAMS ASSOCIATE WITH IT TEND TO BE VERY VIVID AND AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE COMPLETELY PARALYZED AND THE IDEAIS THAT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHY BUT THAT IT'S THE CASE THAT WERE PARALYZED TO PREVENT US FROM ACTING OUT OUR DREAMS IT'S ALLSO AND INTERESTING NER A CHEMICAL PHENOMENON COS DREAMY IS RAPID IVE MOVEMENT DREAMS THEY TEND TO BE VERY INTENSE BUT THE BODY CAN'T RELEASE A DRANOLINE SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE ITS OWN FORM OF TRAMA THERAPYTS LIKE YOUR EXPERIENCING THIS INTENSE THING IN YOUR MIND BUT YOUR BODY REAT YE AND SO OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE I HAVE ARGUED THAT THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO MOVING YOU CAN'T BECAUSE ACTUALLY CAN SOME PEOPLE HAVE WOKEN UP WHILE STILL A BIT PARALYSED IN REM IF YO EVER HAD THAT HAPPENED WE WENT  O BUT I BUT U ACTUALLY COUPLE MY KIDS OF HAVE STRUGGLE WITH THAT ACOUPLE TIMES YER RAM INTERFERENCE IS ALL IT'S NOT DANGEROUS AND USUALLY PEOPLE CONJOLT THEMSELVES OUT BUT IT'S KIND OF TERRIFYING SUCH INTERESTING TO WELL GET TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE THE RECENT INJURY AND THANKFULLY RECOVERY FROM THE INJURY I NOT MIRACULOUS BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT SEEM AS IF ITS SURPRISING FRANKLY I'M NOT SURPRISE THAT YOU'VE RECOVERED BUT IT IS IM SPECTACULAR A THE WAY YOU HAVE BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN YOUR DREAMS BEFORE THE INJURY YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT SCAPE WHONINGWUT YOU FELT LIKE THERE WAS A KIND OF CLO WEN I WAS DOING IT IN MY DREAM THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME RODLOCK THAT I JUST CUT I LIKE WHY CAN'T I GET MY SPEED WHY CAN'T I WHY CAN'T I SNAP OR DO THIS TRICK I'M IT'S MORE IN THE MOMENTS WHERE ITSTWILIGHT MOMENTS WHERE I'M KIND OF AWAKE AND I'M THINKING ABOUT TRICKS THAT EVERYTHING ELSE FALLSE AWAY AND I CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS ON WHAT KIND OF NEW MOVES TO COME UP WITH IM I AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WAS I RECENTLY I WENT TO THE EXCAMES IN JAPAN FEW WEEKS O I AND I WAS THINKING I WAS GOING TO GO MORETS YOU SHOW MY SUPPORT AND BECAUSE THEY HAD A VERT EVENT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF VERTEVENTS ANY MORE SO IF THERE'S A VERT EVENT IT'S KIND OF LI COULD YOU BUILD HAT I WILL COME CAUSE I WANT TO SHOW MY SUPPORT THAT'S THAT THE KIND OF WHERE MY HEART IS AND THEY HAD A BEST TRICK EVENT AND I THOUGHT MAN MAYBE I COULD GET IN THE BEST TRICK OF THER ANYTHING NEW THOUGH YOU KNOW AND I'M STILL RECOVERING FROM MY LEG AND THEN AT SOME POINT I WAS FALLING ASLEEP WHEN I THOUGHT OH I COULD DO THAT TRICK AN COME IN WHEN EIT I KNOW I COULD DO THAT WITH WITH MY CURRENT STATE AND NOT GETTING THOT MUCH SPEED SO TO EXPLAIN WHAT I WAS DOING IS IS  I HALF CAB ODY RAILE BAXIBLUNT OK WE CAN WALK THROUGH THIS HALF CA O CA AS COME UP BACKWARDS COMING EVER CACLY RIGHT TO HALF OU O OUTI T I APPROACHD THE TOP OF THE ROUND I BODY VRAIL THAT MEANS I JUMP AROUND AND THEN I JUMP ROUN ON MY BOARD AND THEN I MAKE SURE THAT IT LANDS WITH MY TWO TRUCKS OUT AND MY TAIL ON THE COPING WHICH IS VERY PRECARIOUS AND I'VE DONE THAT AND COME IN FAKY  THAT'S THE BLUNT PIECE THAT'S THE BLUNT SO I'VE DONE THAT WHERE I ERE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR BEA TO LIFT UP BOARD COME IN FAKY RIGT I'VE DONE THAT I'VE DONE THAT TWICE AND I THOUGHT WELL WHET IF THERE'S SOMETHING I COULD DO LIKE THAT AND THEN I REALIZE THAT IF I JUST KEEP COMING AROUND AND I COME IN BACKS IDE DIRECTION THAT KEEPS MY BODY SPINNING AND NOT MIGHT I SLY BE EASIER IT WASN'T BUT I FIGURE IT UP I THINK I SAW A CLIP OF THIS ON INS DID IT YE I DID IT I DID IT EXCUMS AND I WAS LIKE IT WAS MY LAST ROTON I WAS IT WAS AN ME IT DIDN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE I GOT SEVEN PLACE BUT FOR ME IT WAS A HUGE MOMENT IT FELT AMAZING I BET OH YE FOR SURE I MEA AN'T IF  I WAYS I ME NIT WAS BY WEEKS PREPARATION AND N TRYING TO FIGUE THIS THING OUT I MADE IT TWICE BEFORE THE EVENT OM ON MY OWN ALON ON MY RAM BUT I THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF OF YOU KNOW I WAS I WAS LITERALLY FALLING ASLEEP IN THE OLSINOMS IK I'VE GOT BY ROL BAXI BLUNT I LOVE IT THAT LIMINAL STATE BETWEEN WAKEFULNESS IN SLEEP IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL STATE THAT IF ONE IS OPEN TO IDEAS SHOWING UP THERE YE THEY ALMOST ALWAYS TO I TI TRIE TO SEARCH IN IT THE NEXT MORNING DO YOU EVER FIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE TAKING WALKS OR IN THE SHOWER OR NOT THINKING ABOUT SCAPE WORD O YE THAT'S USUALLY IN IN THE SORT OF MUNDANE MOMENTS THAT THAT I GET INSPIRATION DO YOU HAVE PRACTICES FOR PURE RELAXATION ASIDE FROM SOCIALIZATINI KNOW I I WAS NEVER I THINK THOT SOMETHING I'VE BEEN LACKING I I NEVER WAS GOOD AT WARMING UP STRETCHING POST WARM UP AM THE OR OR OR RELAXING YOU KNOW MEDITATION NOTHING I JUST I I GOSKATE AND IT'S ON AM AND AS I'VE GOT AN OLDER I REALIZED THAT'S NOT THE BEST TECHNIQUE BUT IT'S WORK SO FAR IT HAS WORK A SO FOR YOU IT'S GO HOFULY A LITTLE BIT WARM UP IF YOU I HAVE WARE OF A SORT OF O C D WARM UP RUN THAT I USE TO GAUGE HOW I'M FEELING BUT I KIND HAVE TO GET THROUGH THAT LIKE A SURGEON WHEN A SURGEON'S ABOUT TO DO A SURGERY UM THEY DON'T WARM UP THEY JUST CHECK OFF THE VARIOUS BOXES OF Y TEOT HER THAT'S THERE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THEN THEY DOTHEY DO TH THE LIFE SAVING WORK YA MY I'D SAY MY WARM UPRUN IS IS KIND OF BASIC TRICKS BUT THEY GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW HOW STIFF OR HOW I WOUL I NEED TO ADJUST FOR FOR THE REST OF THE DAY SO I GUESS IT'S NOT SO O S D BUT BUT I DEDN'TLY FEEL LIKE I GOT A GOOT THROUGH THAT ROUTINE WHAT FEELS THE BEST LIKE I I KNOW THAT MAKING A NEW TRICK FEELS INCREDIBLE SPECIALY IF YOU BEN AT A LONG TIME DILIN IT IN SO THAT YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S IT'S OWN FORM OF REWARD YEAM BUT WHAT IS THE MAYBE LIST OF TWO OR THREE THINGS THAT JUST FEELS SO GOOD WHETL THAT FOR SURE LEARNING NOU TRICKS NOT EVEN THAT THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I CREATED BUT JUST DOING SOMETHING THA I'VE NEVER DONE BEFOR WHEN I FIRST LEARNED VARIALS BACKS ID VARIALS NO ONE HAD DONE BACKSIDE VARRELS BEFORE THEY DO'T INT DONE FRONT SIDE A AND A VERIALS WERE YOU YOU REACH DOWN GRAB YOUR BOARD JUMP IN THE AIR AND THEN TURN IT WHEN AIDY UNDER YOUR FEET IT'S IT'S LIKE A SHOBIT BUT YOU'RE GUIDING WITH YOUR HAND I LEARN THAT HALF WAY UP THE POOL THE THE MAIN POOL IN A WAY ADOWASIS WITH NO ONE AROUND AND THE FEELING I GOT WHEN I RODE AWAY WAS SOMETHING THAT I NEVER EXPERIENCE AND IT IS AS LITERALLY THE BUZZ THAT I'VE BEEN CHASING EVER SINCE BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE I CREATED SOMETHINGVERIALS BELOW COPING WAS THAT WAS THE BUT HOW WAS IT IT REALLY WAS AND AND IF YOU SAW BIT YOU OVE IT BLIKE THAT THING LIKE WHAT CAN I SAY IT WAS IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I THOUGHT I THOUGHT OF IT UM I I WENT THROUGH ALL THE MOTIONS OF IT I DID THE WORK AND I FIGURED IT OUT AND YOU KNOW NO ONE NO ONE CARED BUT AT SOME POINT I WAS ABLE TO DO IT SIX FEET IN THE AIR AND DO A FULL THREE SIXTY BARAEL AND SO THAD WAS THE BUILDING BLOCK BUT BUT THAT FEELING WAS LIKE NO OTHER UM I'D SAY THAT AND THEN JUST EVEN TO TO STRIP EVERYTHING ELSE AWAY LIKE THE MOST BASIC TRICS LIKE A BACKSITE ALL IS IS IT AND NO HANDED ARIAL THAT USED TO BE WHAT WAS CALLED BACKSIDE NO HANDED ARIAL IT FEELS SO GOOD BECAUSE EVEN TO THIS DAY PEOPLE PEOPLE SAY I SPPORSTAY ON YOUR FEET AND I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW THE BOARD SAYS ON MY FEET I JUST KNOW I KNOW HOW TO MANEUVER IT AND I KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON IT AND THE FRICTION GOING AND BACKSIDE ALWAYS IS LIKE I THINK IT'S LIKE A MARVEL OF PHYSICS AND A CLEAN BACKSTOLI TO ME AS FEELS GOOD AS ANYTHING THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO BEHOLD I CONFESS I'VE NEVER DONE A LEGITIMATE BACK SAT ALL AN VERT ON A MANYRA SURE BUT NOT ON VERT SO I CAN'T RELATE TO THE FEELING BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU BROUGHT US BACK TO THAT EARLY VERIAL BELOW COPING FEELING AND THAT THAT MARKS THE ASSENCE OF WHAT FEEL SO GOOD WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE RIGHTIN THROVE LIKE A IT'S A TIS AN EARLY I IS IS Y IS A CHEMICAL STAMP IT'S LIKE A THAHEMICAL FINGER PRINT OF PROGRESS RIGHT UM ELL I'M ALSO DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT IT STILL FEELS THAT GOOD TO DO THESE THIN CAUSE I DON'T THINK ANY ONE CAN HAVE THE KIND OF LIFE LONG PROGRESSION THAT YOU'VE HAD AND IT' STILL GOING A WITHOUT A NOT JUST LOVE OF THE THING BUT LOVE OF THE FEELING THAT IT BRINGS WHEN NO ONE'S AROUND CAUSE YOU SID SCATING AUR RAMP BY YOURSELF SO OFTEN ARE YOU ON YOUR RAMP WITH YOU KNOW KNO ONE'S FILMING FOR IN SERAM NO NOTHING FOR AVIDIO NOTHING FOR A VIDIO GAME NONE OF THAT MAYBE THERE'S YOU KNOW MAYBE OTHER GIZER ROUND GAWLS AROUND WILL TALK ABOUT GALLS TO CAUSE ONE OF THE BIG SHIFTS IN ESCAPEBOARDING SINCE I STARTED IS THAT THERE'E SOME AMAZING FEMALE SCAPLR RIGHT NOW AH THERE'S A YOUNG LADY IN FACT THAT'S BEEN ESCAPE WENINT YOUR RAMP FORGIVE ME I CAN'T REMEMBER HER NAME IS IT REA THREESE REASO NELSON GOODNE ITER GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO SHE IS SO YA GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD A SO WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE STARTING ANY KIND OF SPORT OR ACADEMIC CAREER OR BUSINESS OR ANYTHING I THINK PEOPLE ASSUME THAT YOU GO FROM SEERO TO A HUNDRED SOMEHOW AND THAT THERE ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST SELECTED BY GENATICS OR BY LOCK OR BY SOME COMBINATION OF THINGS TO JUST I GET IT AND BE BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU'E SPENT A LOT OF TIME ALONE DRIVING SOME PLACE TE SCAPE THE NEXT DAY OR ALONE AT THE RAMP YOT WER UM SO DO YOU EVER REFLECT ON THAT KIND OF DRIVE UM AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT OR IS IT JUST SO INTRINSIC TO WHO YOU ARE AND NAYD I DON'T I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT I JUST KNOW I HAVE TO DO IT IT'S LIKE I MAN IT I WOULDN'T GET INTO WITH MY INJURY BUT UM I BUT BUT TO GO BACK TO WHAT YOURE SAYING IS YOU SAYING THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT OH YOU WERE CHOSEN FOR THIS OR GENATICS WHATEVER YOU SO LAST THINGS LALK AFT I ALL ONGESGATE YE WHEN I FIRST STARTED SCATING THERE WAS NO WAY YOU'D THINK THAT I WAS NATURAL OR THAT I HAD ANY FUTURE IN IT I WAS ALL GANGLEY AZOLOVE PLAYS I WAS EATING SHID LEFT HIM RIGHT LIKE IT JUST IT IT WASN'T I WASN'T GOOD I WASN'T I WASN'T A NATURAL  I'VE SEEN PEOPL LD THAT ARE NATURALS AND I'VE SEEN THAT HOW THEY DON'T HAVE THAT DRIBE THEY DON'T HAVE THE DISCIPLINE AND IT'S NOT WASTED BUT I THEY JUST DON'T THEY DON'T YOU DOLIKE THEN DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THEY HAVE NATURALLY AND AND FOR WHATEER REASON I DON'T DON'T FAULT ANY ONE FOR IT BUT I'VE SEEN BOTH SIDES OF IT AND I'VE ALSO SEEN OTHER SKATERS WHO ARE JUST DRIVEN AND WHO ARE NOT REALLY GOOD CONOFSLOBBY AND BECOME THE BEST AND GORENALS OHYE WHEN WE PUT HIM ON OUR TEAM HE WAS JUST LIKE ME SUBER GANGLING IS BOARDS BOUNCING AROUND BUT HE'S TRYING EVERY SINGLE TRICK AND EVERY TIME HE SEND ME A VIDIO IT'S SOME NEW TECHNIQUE THAT HE'S FIGURED OUT AND HE DIDN'T REALLY A BY UNTRAINED I HE DIDN'T HAVE THE SKILLSET FOR AND THEN HE BECAME THE BOSS YOU KNOW AN I MEAN SO I THINK IT'S JUST YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT AS MUCH WEIGHT AS NATURAL TIM IF NOT MORE I'D SAY MORE Y I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY MORE FOR SCIENCE AND YOU NOTHER PEOPLE ARE IN THE LAB LATE AT NIGHT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING IN DRILLING WAY NOT OU NOT ALWAYS THE SMARTEST CERTAINLY NOT THE A DOMIST BUT SMART ENOUGH TO SHOW UP WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE LEAVING AND CONTINU AND I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF FRICTION INTERNALLY I MONY NI MONT BE MA THEY BE EXTERNALLY ALSO BUT JUST SOME FRICTIONS SON I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU YE YE E MY BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT AND I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THIS YET UM CAUSE I DID A PRIVATELY BUT I I BROKE MY LEG DOING TO MAX TWEST SOMETHING THAT I'VE DONE THOUSANDS OF TIMES BY FORTY FIVE FORTY YOT SO IT'S IT'S A ONE AND A HALF SPIN IN THE BACKSIDE DIRECTION BUT THAT PARTICULAR GRAB THAT YOU DO MAKES IT A ME TWIST BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU KIND A FLIP UPSIDE DOWN SO'S KIND ABOUT ONE AND A HALF SOMER SAULT I IT'S NOT MY TRICKS MIGHT MAGILL'S TRICK I LEARNED IT NOT LONG AFTER HE CREATED IT IN NINETEEN EIHTY FOUR BEEN DOING EVER SINCE  I'M TIME OUT FORTY YEARS MTWESS RIGHT I'VE GOTTEN HER ONCE OR TWICE BUT NOT BAT ANYWAY I FUCKED AROUND AND FOUND OUT DID ONE WITH NO SPEED LAST YEAR THINKING I COULD DO IT LIKE I WAS STILL TWENTY AND GOT TANGLED UP AND AND BROKE MY FEAMER I HAD A STUBER LONG RECOVERY I HAD A FALSE START I HAD A NON UNION FRACTURE WHICH MEANS MY BONE NEVER CONNECTED BACK T ITSELF AND KEPT BEPUSHING ITSELF FURTHER AWAY AM AND THAT'S ALL I IN THE PAST I I GOT A SECOND SURGERY IN NOVEMBER AND ALL ALONG IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD IS I GOT TO GET BACK TO FIVE FORTIES I HAVE TO AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY I HAVE TO I HATE THAT IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO ME BUT IT IT'S IN HERE YOU KNW ME IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A SENSE OF PRIDE IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE TO PROVE THIS TO ANY ONE I JUST HAVE TO DO IT AND LAST WEEK I DID IT SO SCARY AND I CREPT FOR IT I I MEAN I EVEN DOWN TO LIKE MY DIET AND I I STOPPED DRINKING ALTOGETHER AND I WAS LIKE EVERY TIME I GO TO THE RAMP I'M JUST TRYING FIVE FORTYS LIKE TO GET THE SPIN TO GET TO GET THE LANDING ZONE WITH NO INTENTION TO MAKE YET JUST THAT I HAD TO GET THERE AND THEN I HAD TO HAVE THIS HEART TO HEART WITH MY WIFE THAT YOU KNOW SHE DOESNT WANT TO SEE ME GET HER SHOES DON'T SEE ME RISKING MYSELF THIS AGE ANY MORE SHE DOES'T WANT TO LIVE THROUGH ANOTHER TRAMATIC INJURY WITH ME AND I HAD TO TELL HER LIKE I HAVE TO DO THIS SHE WAS GRACIOUS AND ACCEPTING AND THAT'S ALL I CULD ASK FOR IT WASN'T LIKE SHE WAS LIKE YA YOU GOT TO GO DO IT WAS LIKE OKE AND SO YOU ARE AND SO SHE WAS THERE SHE WAS MY ONLY SPECTATOR SO ITI CONFESS I'VE SEEN O VIDYO OF THIS AND MY FIRST RESPONSE WAS AH AF YES AIN MY SECOND RESPONSE WAS THAT WAS REALLY HIGH LIKE THIS IS NO YOU KNOW JUST ABOVE COPING FIVE FOLITIN THIS IS AN EVEN YOU KNOW THIS IS A HEAD HIGH FIVE FORT I'M NOT GONG TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID LAST TIME WHERE I TRY O LOW THINKING I JUST GET AWAY WITH IT ANY MORE OR SO THE GOING HIGH WAS MORE OF A SAFETY MEASURE WHICH IS IRONIC THE THE THE BIGGER THE RAMPS FOR ME THE SAFER IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE A BETTER LANDINGS I HAVE MORE TIME IN THE AIR TSO THE JUST AND EVEN THOUGH IT LOOK SPECTACULAR AND USIXTEEING THER ISS LIKE NO I NEED THAT I CAN'T SCAPE SOME EIGHFOOTPOOL IHAVE NO LANDINGSON I'M TOO TALL I'M TOO I MOVED TOO SLOWLY NOW TO DO THAT KIND OF STUP THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE ME LIKE IN THE PARK EVENTS SOLIKE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'R GONG TO SEE ME ON THIS FOURTEEN FOLVER RAM BECAUSE THAT'S MY HAPPY PLACE AND THAT'S WHERE I'M SAFE AH BUT ALSO HAVING MY WIFE THERE I JUST KNEW I WASN'TG TO GET HEARD FROM HER CAUSE I WOULD IV IN SUCH TROUBLE THE THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND PRESSURE IS A IS A REAL THING AND IN THE BEST WAYS A NOT TO FOCUS ON THE BAD ASPECTS OF THE INJURY BECAUSE THERE ARE THE PLENTY TYE AD THAT I RECALL YOU AND I COMMUNICATED NOT LONG AFTER THE IT'S A BUT'S CALL IT WHAT IT WAS THE FIRST BREAK AND I REMEMBER YOU SAID TO ME OVER TAX YOU SAID HOW LONG BEFORE I'M SCAPE WARDING AGAIN AND I SAID AM SCAPE WARDING AS IN PUSHING OR SKINHORDING AS IN AM WHAT YOU DO ON VERT YOU KNOW AND YOU SAID A WHAT I DO ON VERT AND I SAID WHAT SEEMS YOU ARE DOING A LOT OF THINGS YOU WERE DOING DELIVERATE COLD

LISTEN TO ANY OF THE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHILE I'VE DONE I'VE COME THIS FAR AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO PUSH THROUGH BROKEN PALVAS BROKEN ELBOW AH NESURGERIES AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE TIME LINES ALWAYS VERY SHORTEND FOR ME BECAUSE I JUST GET BACK OUT THERE AND I  AND I GET THE HEALING STARTED BUT I ALSO AM COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF EXTREMELY RISKY BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I WANT TO GET BACK OUT THE RIGHT AWAY AND NOT LONG AFTER THE ACADEMY WARDS I I WAS ACTALY WALKING WITH THA CANE AT THAT TIME AND I DITHED THE CANE JUST TO WALK OUT ON STAGE TO PRESENT THE ARDS THAT WAS MY BIG MY BIG COMING OUT MOMENT BUT IT WAS KIND OF FOREST AND AS SOON AS I WALKED OUT THE SAYO GOT MY CAN AND I WAS HOBLING IN THE BACK STAGE UM BUT I WAS I WAS SKATING CUT OF A MEANI RAMP AND AND I WAS ALREADY STRUGGLING BECAUSE I COULDN'T PUT MY WAIGHT ON MY FRONT FOOT BECAUSE MY BONE STILL HAD NOT CONNECTED TO ITSELF SO THRE'S A GAP IN THE BONE BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A NAIL BUT THEY CALLED NAIL YOU KNOW BIG PIECE OF METAL THAT'S HOLDING THEM IN PLACE BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW CAREFUL I NEEDE TO BE WITH THAT BECAUSE IT WAS SO PRECARIOUS AND I DECIDED I'M GOING TO DROP IN ON THE MINYRAM I THINK I'M READY AND AND IT WASN'T THE DROP IN ON THE MANRAP IT WAS ME GETTING TO THE TOP OF THE MINYRAMP AND STEPPING OFF MY BONIT'S ALWAYS THAT KORANDOV BUT BUT I JUST STEPPED OFF MY BOARD LIKE I WOULD DO ANY OTHER DAY BUT I DIDN'T THINK I LED WITH MY FRONT FOOT AND I FELT THE BONE MOVE IN THAT MOMENT I IE REALLY I FELT IT I FELT IT EITHER TWIST OR GET OUT A PLACE AND I WAS IN TOTAL DENIAL FOR MONTHS CAUSE I JUST SET ALLI JUST IT JUST HURTS NOW LIKE I YOU KNOW ID I GOT A MINOR SET BACK AND THEN I FINALLY EIGHT MONTHS INTO MY RECOVERY SEVEN MONTHS INTO MY RECOVERY I WAS ALWAYS IN PAIN MY SKATING WASN'T PROGRESSING I COULDN'T GET SPEED AND BY ALL MEASURES I SHOULD' BE BACK AT LEAST I'D BE BACK TO A LEVEL THAT I FEEL GOOD ABOUT AND I WENT GOT EXTRACE AND THEY SAID YOUR BONE NEVER CONNECTED YOU HAVEN' ON UNION TRACTURE AND AND AND AND EVERY TIME I SKATED SO MY BONES LIKE THIS EVERY TIME I SKATED I WAS PUSHING IT FURTHER AWAY AND SO MY BONE WAS LIKE THIS ON THE LAST AX RAY AND AND THAT WAS THE HARD TRUTH SO FOR THIS LISID LUK JUST LATTERLY DISPLACE THING ABOUT A PIPE THAT'S BROKEN IN THE MIDDLE AN JUST ONCE OFFSET TO THE OTHER AND AND AS I KEEP SKATING AND I I COULD FORCE MY SKIT LIKE I CAN O LEARN THIS HACK WHERE I CAN PUT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT ON MY WAY ON MY BACK FOOT AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MY FRONT FOOT AND DO WHAT I WANTED TO DO BUT IT WASN'T WHERE I THOUGHT I'D BE AND IT JUST HURT ALL THE TIME I MEANT REALLY WAS LIKE THAT WAS MY TRIGGER ECAUSE I ID HAVE A PRETTY HIGH TOLERANCE T PAIN AND IT WAS ALWAYS HRLIKE I I WOULD DREAD GOING TO THE AIRPORT KNOWING I HAD TO WALK TO A GATE SO I KNEW SOMETHING S WRONG THERE I WENT TO A SPECIALIST UM THAT DEALS IN NON UNION FRACTURES AND HE HAD A VERY PRAGMATIC FACTUAL APPROACH AND WAS I OUGHT I WOULD DO THIS I'M TAKE MY NAIL OUT AND TAKE THE OTHER HARDWERE OUT AND PUT IT TOGETHER AND YOU CANNOT MOVE FOR TWO MONTHS DID YOU OBEY THAT OWR IDID REALLY YE SO WHAT IS SHELLIN I WAS NOT INA RIS THAT AGAIN DID YOU UM AND DO YOU PRITIZED THINGS LIKE SLEEP U NUTRITIAN UM JUST YOU KNOW GENERALLY AND DID YOU EMPHASIZE THOSE THINGS WHILE YOU WERE RECOVERING FROM THE ENTRY YE I I I WAS VERY DISCIPLINED IN MY

I CAN'T GET A HOLD OF MY BORD TO PULL IT ALL THE WAY BACK LIKE I USE TO UH IF I CAN GET THAT I'LL FEEL I THAT'S IT THAT'S THAT'S THAT WAS THE LAST MILE SONTLY I'M NOT HERE TO I DIGNOSON EN TREAT THESE A SPECIFIC A SCAPE WHAR TRICK ISIMS BUT BETWEEN YOUR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE SLAW EAR AND WHAT YOU SAYING ABOUT LAS THIS OUTGRA SEEMS LIKE THEIR SAME THEREABOUT ABOUT GETTING YOUR YOUR YOUR MY FRON HAND AROUND AND AND ROUND MY GAILING IT BACK BACK IDM A BEHIND YOU SO MAYBE THIS IS LIKE THE WAY THAT THE FEMERS LINING UP WITH YOUR PELVIS AND MAYBE SOME OFFER HIM SOMETHING OR OTHER I THE THER I DO I I AM ACTUALLY WORKING WITH UM A BEST CORE HE IS A HE IS THA DOCTOR OF PHYSICAL THERAPY AND HE HAS HELPED ME IMMENSELY THROUGH MY RECOVERY AND WHEN I'M FRUSTRATED WITH THIS MOTION OR THAT'S THE SAME GRAB ACTUALLY HAS IN THE TWIST HE WORKED ON ME BEFORE IT AND WAS JUST CONTORTING MY BODY AND MY LEG INTO THESE POSITIONS THAT I DON'T REALLY EVEN GET TO WHEN I'M SCATING JUST TO PREPARE ME FOR THAT AND HE DID BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'SOOK IT'S INTERESTING THAT WERE A TALK HE MOT SCAPE WORDING AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS WHER TIME I NUTRITION WIS TI CUL NOT SLEEP SO GROWING ON ME I NNONE OF THAT NONE O THA NEVER IMAGINED ANETER AN AND I'M CHUCKLING CAS OU NO GROWING UP SCAPE WORDING UM EARLY ON FOR ME A NOT QUITEAS EARLYEAS YOU BUT PRETTY EARLY TWELVE UM AND GOT OUT OF IT N BACK AND YES I CAN STILL DO A THING OR TWO HERE AND THERE UM BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT THE POINT IS AT YOU KNOW THE NUTRITION CONSISTED LARGELY OF YOU KNOW FAST FOOD OR WHATEVER WAS AROUND CIGARETTES AND BEER WERE SORT OF THE THE ENERGY DRINKS AND A I AND AM SUPPLEMENTS OF OF THE TIMES THIS IS FORTUNATELY CHANGED BUT THERE THERE WIS SENTIALLY NO HEALTH PROMOTING TOOLS OR ASPECTS ET AT ALL BUT THAT WAS BACK THEN BUT THEN OVER TIME IT SEEMS IT'S EVOLVE LIKE NOW I SEE AM I SAW A COUPLE POST FROM STEVE WILLIAMS LIKE HE'S IN THE GIM SRUM I THINK I SAW DANNY WAY EARLY ON WORKING WITH PALL CHAK AND DOING SOME BALANCE WORK NACK WORK CAUS HE HAD BROKEN HIS NECK SIRING AND THINGS THT SORT SO THERE SEEMS TO AV BEEN A BIG SHIFT OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS WERE SCAPE ORDERS ARE TAKING GOOD CARE OF THEIR BODIES LIKE OTHER ATHLES THINKING ABOUT THE RAZILIENTS OF THEIR BODIES AND ALSO GENERALLY TAKING BETTER CARE LIKE A LOT OF AM OP NOT TO DRINK AN DO DRUGS AND  ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO I MEAN HOW DOES IT STRIKE YOU TO SEE THE WAY THAT SCAPE WOARDINGS EVOLVED TOWARDS THE OPTION TO BE MUCH HEALTHIER ENTREAT IT LIKE LIKE A SERIOUS SPORT WHERE YOU ARE SERIOUS LYT TAE WORD THAT YOU KNOW EVEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO TWENTY YEARS AGO IF YOU CALL TASGIDBOARDER AND ATHLETE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HIM BE OFFENDED OH A PEOPLE INSCAPE WOARDING  ABSOLUTELY YE UM WE'LL TO ANSWEYOR QUESTION IN THE EARLY DAYS THAT WAS PART OF THE THE SEEN IN THE CULTURE J CAUSE THE T IT WAS THE ANTITHESIS TO ORGANIZED TEAM SPORTS AND MAINSTREAM CULTURE AND SO IT WAS JUST LIKE YET IS WHAT WE DO FOCGE CARESLI WE DRANK AND WE SCAYED AND EVERYONE IVS IT WAS WILD WEST RIGHT BUT AS I NEVER FELL INTO THAT DEEPLY BECAUSE I SAW HOW IT AFFECTED PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCES AND THE SCATING ITSELF WAS PARAMOUNT TO ME THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE GOOD AT AND I SAW PEOPLE PARTYING AND PARTYING THEIR SKILLS AWAY SO I HAD AT LEAST THAT FORETHOUGHT UM AND THEN AS SCANNING GOT MORE ESTABLISHED POPULAR MORE OF A CAREER OPTION THEN PEOPLE STARTED TAKING MORE SERIOUSLY ESPECIALLY COMPETITORS I MEAN   BUT THERE'S SUCH A WIDE SWATH OF OF WHAT SCAPE WARDING IS AND IT'S A BIG TENT SO TO SAY THAT IT'S MORE ORGANIZED YES IT'S MORGANIZE OVER HERE THEY'RE STILL ALL THESE SCATERS OVER HERE PARTYING HOPPING FENCES DON'T CARE ABOUT CONTEST DON'T WANT SMONSTERS O LIKE GXS ONE THOUSAND LIKE THOSE KISED BAM HILLS AN SARASATO LIKE IT LIKE U BUT THAT THAT AT A A A BAIS IS THE DIVERSITY OF IT ALL AND THAT THAT'S WE'RE ALL PART OF THIS SCENE SO I I WAS A COMPETITOR THAT WAS THAT WAS MY PATH TO SUCCESS AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT PEOPLE TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY NOW AND THAT THEY DO HAVE TRAINER THEY HAVE RESOURCES  MEAN THEY HAVE SPONSORS THAT WILL PAY FOR THIS KIN OF STUFF HERE WAS NO SUCH THING COMMIEN LIKE AT OUR BIGGEST CAPE CONTEST WE WERE ALL STAYING AT STACY PARLTAS PARENT'S HOUSE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HE WOULD TAKE US OUT TO GET SPIGETTY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT CARBAHID DRATES WAS GOING TO GIVE US ENERGY THE NEXT DAY THAT ALWAS THE EXTENT OF TRAINING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE RI BUT NOWADAYS IT WERE TREATED LIKE I A LEED ATHLEES BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE IF YOU REALLY LOOK IT PEOPLE THERARE O THE TOP OF THEIR FEELD PEOPLE LIKE NOT YOU USED TON YOU KNOW I TO MEAN LIKE THE DOIT S A MACHINE HE IS HE IS ONE OF THE MOST PRECISE SCATERS THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN OR PRECISE ATHLETES THE SIDE OF NOT  OUCOMIN EACH YOU N YES I'M I I M I'M AGING MYSELF BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS LIKE THIS IS THIS IT TAKES HARD CORPE DEDICATION PRECISION ATHLETICISM AND DEVOTION AND SO NOW THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BACK THAT UP AND TO KEEP IT GOING LONGER I MEAN YIE WOULD I BE ABLE TO DO THIS NOW ESPECIALLY AFTOR GETTING HURT WITHOUT THE HELP OF A DOCTOR OF PHYSICAL TRAINING PROBABLY NOT I DO IT ON SOME LEVEL BUT I WOULDN'T GET TO WHERE I AM NOW UM AND SO EY I THINK IT'S ALSO IYU KNOW I I NEVER I NEVER WANTED TO COVE IT SCAPEBOARDING AS THIS THING THAT NO ONE ELSE CANLIKE A GATE KEEPER TO IT NO ONE ELSE CAN TOUCH IT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING O SCAPE BOARNING THAT WAS MAGICAL AND THAT WAS GOOD FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT WAS THAT WAS REQUIRED SUCH UM REQUIRED SUCH PASSION AND I DIDN'T I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY IT DIDN'T GET BIGGER THROUGH THOSE THOSE LEAN YEARS AS ALWAYS I KIDS THIS SPEAKS TO KIDLIC IT'S IT'S THEIR DEVIL AND IT'S ACTIVE AND IT'S EXCITING AND YOU CAN DO IT AS A GROUP BUT YU CAN DO IT YOUR OWN WAY AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THOSE THINGS IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO FIGURE IT OUT THET DOESN'T FINGITE IT OUT I MEAN NOWADAYS SCATERS OF THE COOLGIDS IN SCHOOL AS IND THE OLYMPICS LI THERE WAS ALWAYS DISCUSSION WOULD IT BE WAS AN EXHIBITION SPORTING THEOLYMPICS AT ONE PO OINT NO NO NO O I THOUGHT IT WAS IT FORMAYBE IT HAD A RUN IT PRETENTIALLY BEING AN EXHIBITIONHERE WERE THERE WAS TALK ABOUT IT GOT OM BUT'S IT NEVER DID AN AND NOT THE I MEAN IT SOME POINT ESPECIALLY IN THE LATE NINETIES ORETY THOUSANDS SKIING WAS GETTING APPRECIATED AND AND KIND OF REACHED THAT THRESHOLD OF A IS IT MAINSTREAM WELL IT'S IN IT'S ALL MAC DONAL'S COMMERCIALS SO I GUESS THAT'S PRETTY MAINSTREAM AND SO WE ALREADY HAD COME OF AGE AND IT WASE LIKE WE DON'T NEDING LYMPICS WE'RE ALREADY MORE POPULAR THAN A LOT OF LYMPIC SPORTS RIGHT SO WHY DO WE NEED THEIR VALIDATION AND THEN AT SOME POINT IT BECAME LIKE THE THE POWER DYNAMIC SHIFTED IT WAS LIKE OH THEY NEED ARE COOL FACTOR WE DON'T NEED THEIR VALIDATION AND D IT WAS LIE YEOKE YOU GUESS ON IT SURE GO AHEAD BUT HOLD THE EVENTS HOLD THE CUALL FIRES WELL PARTICIPATED BUT WE DON'T NEED THIS WYO'VE BEEN AN AMAZING AMBASSADOR FOR THE SPORT THAT'S DRIVEN SO MUCH OF THAT WIDER ACCEPTANCE AND PROGRESSION AND INVITATION INTO DIFFERENT DOMAINS ONE OF THE A THINKS THAT I DEFLYUONT TALK ABOUT IS THE VIDIOGAME I BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE VIDIO GAME CHANGED A LOT OF THINGS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THEIR PERCEPTION OFESCAPE WORDING I MEAN WHAT IT ALOWD OF COURSE IS THIS IS OBVIOUS BUT IT ALLOWED KIDS IT WEREN'T GOING TO YOU KNOW A BANG UP THEIR SHINS OR WALK IN WITH A BROKEN RAS IR YOU' ALL SKINNED UP TO TO DO INCREDIBLE TRICKS BUT IN SILICO ON A SCREEN RIGHT AND TO A PRETEND THAT THEY ARE THAT THE PROSCAPE WORDER A TION YO WAT WHAT VIDIOGAMES ARE ABOUT AND YET WHEN YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING JUST LIKE YOU CAN MAGINE IT IN A DREAM OR WHILE YOU'RE FALLING ASLEEP AND YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING AND AND HEARING AIR QUOT TO DO SOMETHING IN OF VIDIO GAME IT ALSO IS GOING TO INSPIRE A NUMBER OF KITS O OUTSIDE AND GRAB A REAL SCAPE WOARD AND TRY THAT OR TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO CLEARLY THE VIDIO GAME WAS A CATALIST FOR WHAT I CONCERNE NOW THET THE WIDE ACCEPTANCE OF SCAPE WOARING AS A SPORT IN ALL ITS VARIOUS FORMS A COUN YUSE TALK FOR A LBIT ABOUT THE GENISIS OF THE VIDIO GAME WERE YOU INDIVIDIO GAMES PRIOR GETHER THE DIO GAME AM WERE YOU INTOTECHNOLOGY GENERALLY AND IN WHAT E SORT OF MOTIV A THE INTEREST IN THE VIDIO GAME BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY HAS CHANGED THE FACE OF ACTUAL SCAPE WOARDING AND THE PERCEPTION OF SCAPE WOARDING A WHA I'VE BEEN INTO VIIO GAMES SINCE THE GECO MAY NI WAS A KID YOU PLAN POM PACKMAN MISSL COMMAND CUBERT YOU NAME AT AND THEN GETTING THE HOME SYSTEMS IN TALIVISION SUBERANIAS COMMON OR SIXTY FOUR AM SANGA SAGA YA BUT BUT I AM AND I ALWAYS LOVED TECHNOLOGY SO WHEN IE WHEN I FINALLY STARTED MAKING MONEY IN THE EIGDIES MY FIRST COUNT OF BIG PURCHASE IN TERMS OF THAT  IN IN TERMS OF LECTRONICS WAS A COMMODORE MEGA WHICH WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE HIGHEST END A HOME COMPUTERS YOU KNOW ALONGSIDE MAC BUT BUT MORE GRAPHIC ORIEN AN AN MORE GAME ORN AM AND SO I WAS ALWAYS IN TO THAT IDEA THAT YOU COULD DO THIS KIND OF STUFF AT HOME NOCHUST IN ARCADES AND THEN I GOT A I GOT A CALL FROM A PIECY PROGRAMMER THET WANTED TO PITCH ESCAPE GAME AND HAD A CRUDE ENGINE OF AM SCATER THAT CRUIS ROUND GOIN BOWLS ANSELF I GOT AND YET WAS OLVE KEEBOARD CONTROLET IVES CLUNKEY BUT WA SOMETHING AND THE LAST THING THAT WE HAD AS SCATING WAS SEVEN TWENTY IN THE ARCADE OR SCATOR DIE FOR HOME SYSTEMS FOR COMONERSIS FOR THAT WAS LIKE THE LAST THING THAT HAD HAPPENED FOR SCAPE WORDING A INVIDIO GAMES AND SO I WENT WITH HIM I WAS EXCITED TO LIKE I GOT TO WE GOT TO GO TO NINTANDO AND PITCHIT A WE WENT TO MIDWAY YOU KNOW WE WENT TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT A CONSUL AND SOFPER MANUFACTURERS AND WERE JUST TOLD THAT THIS IS A BAD IDEA SCAPE WHNE HE'S NOT POPULAR HOM VIDIO GAMES ARE BARELY A THING WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO BUY A VIDIO GAME ABOUT SCAPEBOARD SOME ONE SAID THOSE EXACT WORDS TO ME AAT MIDWAY AND SO HE GOT FRUSTRATED HE NEEDED TO FIND A JOB AND I WAS I WAS JUST CONE A FREE FLOATING SO THOUGHT O AN GAS WELL I'M I'M KNOCKING TO DO THIS BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE ESTABLISHED YOURSELF AT LEAST IN THE VIDIO GAME WORLD A INDUSTRY THAT YOUR INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING SOE MAYBE SOME ONE DOES SOMETHING TOL CALL YOU ANOAS I YE RIGHT SURE SURE ENOUGH LIKE A YEAR LATER AT DIV ISION CALLED ME SAID HAY WE HEARD YOU WANT TO DO A VIDI GAME I SAID WELL YES I WOULD LOVE TO WORK ON TA VIDIO GAME I'M NOT A PROGRAMMER OR ANYTHING SO WE HAVE SOMETHING WORKING ON I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW TO YOU AND SO I WENT UP TOACK O VISION A THEY WERE WORKING ON A SCAPE GAME BUT IT WAS BASED ON AN ENGINE OF A GAME THAT WAS ALREADY RELEASE CALLED A POCALIPS STARRING BRUCE WILLIS SO THE FIRST VERSION OF MY GAME WAS BRUCE WILLIS ON A SCAPEBOARD WITH THE GUNS TROPPED TO HIS BACK IN IT DESER WASE LAND DOING KICKSLIPS AND IT WAS ALSO IT WAS I WAS TRULY LIKE I PICKED IT UP AND I GOT PAST THAT VISUAL AND THEN I STARTED PLAYING IT AND AND IT WAS INTUITIVE IT THE MOTION FELT RIGHT THE ENGINE WAS RIGHT AND I WAS LIKE THIS THIS IS THE BASE LINE OF SOMETHING SPECIAL I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE SOME BIG HIT I JUST THOUGHT THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO BE APPRECIATED BY SCAPEBOARDERS AND THAT WAS MY GOL THE ENTIRE A DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WHICH WAS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER I SIGNED ON WE THREWG THAT YEAR AND A HALF WE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THEY WOULD THEY WOULD FEDAX ME BUILDS ON SEEDEES I HAD A MODIFIED PLAYSTATION AND I WOULD PLAY AT MAKE NOTES AND I THOUGHT MANSKATERS GOING TO DIG THIS AND THAT WAS IT AND SKATING WAS EMEN THAT POPULAR IT WAS COMING TO IT YOU KNOW IT WAS STARTING TO GET SOME TRACTION WHAT YOUR WASISSGAN LIKE NINETY EIGHT SO WAS LIKE EXGAMES WERE STURING TO COME NTO THE FOLD PEOPLE WERE TAKING NOTE OF WHATSKY WHEN NG HAD BECOME AT THAT POINT AND THEN I THOUGHT THI SKIN TO BE COLD SKATERS GN A LIKE IT AND THEN UM NOT LONG BEFORE THE RELEASE THEY CALLED ME AND THEY SAID HEY WE WENT O UM WE WENT OFF FOR YOU TO BUY OUT OF FUTURE ROYALTIES FOR THIS GAME UM CAUSE I THINK YOU KNOT THIS I THINK YEU'VE REN A LIKE IT MOSI WHT DIES TAT MEAN THAT G WILL GIVE YOU HALF MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN YOU DON'T GET ROYALTIES GOING FORWARD BUT YOU GET THAT MONEY A FRONT AND AT THAT TIME MY LIFE LIKE TO YEURSOME WAS A HALF MILLION DOLLARS SERIOUSLY SOUNDED LIKE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS LIKE NO ONE ENEVER TALKED ABOUT NUMBERS THAT BIG TO ME ALSO NINETY EIGHT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A QUIET TIME FOR VERTSCAPE BOARDING TO ASURE YE WAS ALL  BO  GENERAL WENT BUT YE R VERT LUCKILY VERTSATING STILL WAS A THING BECAUSE OF INLINESKATING BECAUSE INLINSKATING WAS HUGE RIGHT LATE NINETIES AND THEY WERE ALL VERT AND SO WE HAD SKATERS GOT TO SORT OF RIDE THOSE COAT TAILS CAUSE IT WAS I GAT THERE OUR VER RAMS FOS EVERONES ROLLER BLATING I FORGOT ABOUT THAT THAN THAT DAD LIKE IT AND I HAV HONESTLY LIKE I WAS THE SPECIAL GUEST AT A COUPLE OF INLINE ROLER BLADE SHOWS WHERE WAS LIKE THIS AS TEAM ROLLER BLAY ALIVE AND SPECIAL GUEST DON'T HOLAT THE SCAPE ORDER AND I WAS LIKE I I DROVING IN BUT IT PAID THE BILLS UM SO CHANCEER O LIKE TO TO FOR FROM WHAT YOU WERE SAYING VERTSGATING WAS IT WAS A THING AT LEAST ESTABLISHD IN THE AXSCAPES WHICH WAS SOMETHING AND ENOUGH FOR US TO MAKE A LIVING IM SO WHEN DAY OFFERD ME THIS MONEY I ACTUALLY WAS IN A PRETTY GOOD PLACE I'M IN TERMS OF MY I DON'T KNOW MY OPTIONS N MI MY TRUJACTORY AND I FELT LIKE AND I IAD JUST BOUGHT A NEW HOME AND I THOUGHT I'M MANO TAKE A CHANCE AND TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND I THI WAS THE BEST FINANCIAL DIZES N I HAVE MIT TOOK THE EQUITY YE I JUST LET A RIDE BUI WAS LIKE NOT WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH US AND AS SOON AS THE GAME WAS RELEASED IT WAS GETTING STELLERYIEWS AND THEN I REMEMBER LIKE THE VERY NEXT WEEK AFTER WAS RELEASE NEVER STOPPED SAYING CAVE WERE WORKS ON NUMBER TWO WHAT YOU WANTE TO LIKE WHAT O YOU MEAN WE EWERE DOING SEQUEL WITH WHAT BLOSSOM NTHE WE ENT OF DOING LIKE TEN MAZI CRAZY MAZING I'M THINKING ABOUT YOUR DECISION TO NOT TAKE THE CASH AND DESEET HOW IT WOULD GO I'M THINKING ABOUT I

SEEMED T YOUR THERST COUPLE CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY AND WHAT NOT BUT IT'S CLEAR TO ME BASED ON A NUMBER OF THINGS AND THAT INTERACTION AND WHAT I OBSERVED THERE THAT EITHER YOU HAD SOME ONE IN YOUR EAR EITHER YOU'R DAD OR MAUM OR BOTH OR MAYBE IT HAD BEEN STACY OR MAYBEIT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WAS ADVISING YOU TO MAKE VERY GOOD FINANCIAL DECISIONS LIKE NOT SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY OR CONTINUE TO SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY AM TO INVESTIN THINGS OU KNOW OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST INSTILED IN YOU AT A YOUNG AGE WHO KNOWS I'M ASKING BECAUSE I THINK SO MANY PEOPLE BURNED THERE EARLY SUCCESS YOU KNOW WHAT REPRESENTS A LOT OF WEALTH FOR THEM EARLY ON THEY BURNE THAT WHERE THEY START MAKING JUST BAD DECISIONS YOU EXPLAIN BEFORE WHY YOU TENDED TO AVOID DRUGS AN ALCOHOL  CERTAINLY AM ANY SEVERE RELATIONSHIP TO DRUGSRALCALL THAT WOULD KEEP YOU FROM PROGRESSING AND SCAPEWARDING BUT YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO MAKE REALLY GOOD DECISIONS AS A YOUNG FAMOUS ATHLE IIS MORE RARER THAN IT IS COMMON EVEN WHEN PEOPLE HAVE COACHES SO I'M CURIOUS YOU KNOW WHERE DID THAT A SHREWDNESS AND THAT PRUDENCE COME FROM AND WAS FRANK YOUR DAD AND MAYBE NANCY ALSO YOUKNOW ADVISING ALL LALL LIKE HATE YOU KNOW AM THINK SMART BE SMART BECAUSE CLEARLYOU MADE SOM SOME VERY SMART DECISIONS UM HE WAS DEFINITELY A GUIDE IN A HE HE WAS THE FIRST ONE WHO SAID YOU SHOULD PROVIY BY REAL STATE I WAS SEVENTEEN SO I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS

DEFINITELY HELPS PROPEL MY SKATING TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN I EVER IMAGINED BUT AT SOME POINT THAT WAS JUST A DRAIN AND IT WAS A DRAINED FINANCIALLY AND I WAS LIVING BEYOND MY MEANS AND MY INCOME

HUNTER BOX FOR A SOUT WEST FLIGHT WHATEVER AIR LINE IT WAS WELL IT'S IT'S FUN AND I THINK IMPORTANT TO REMINISTS ABOUT THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE IM THEY AREN'T JUST YOUR PARENTS BUT THET THEY DONE SO MUCH AND THROUGH YOU A YOU NI I REALLY THINK THAT AEMOTIONS AND STORIES ARE REALLY LIKE THE EQUIVALENT OF ENERGY IN HUMANS YE WON'T PEUEL OI WHAT ENERGY BECAUSE THAT GETS CARRIED FORWARD UM SPEAKING OF WHICH A WE SHARE A COMMON LOVE OF SOME PARTICULAR MUSIC ARE YOU SOMEBODY WHO LISTENS TO MUSIC TOU TO UM TO INSPIRE YOU TO GET AMPED UP TO ESCAPE WORD IS MUSIC AND IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR LIFE YA IT'S FOR THIS WAY I I HAD I HAD A PLAYLESS FOR MY FIVE FOR ITY THE OTHER DAY OK FINE TUNE TO THAT TRICK AND WHAT WOULD GET MEMOTIVATED IN HEIGHE TO TO DO IT  YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH US WHAT'S ON T E PLAYLIST UNLESS YO YOU CHOOSE TO AH MYAN BUT WAS AT HIGH ENERGY LOW ENERGY HIGH ENERGY WELL AND AND SOME MEANINGFUL SONGS LIKE A NE ORDERS CEREMONY AND I I SEE NINE SNAILS GETTING SMALLER BECAUSE THAT WAS A A SONG WE USED IN ONE OF OUR BIG SCAPE TORS AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST HIGH ENERGY SECTIONS OF OF THE SHELL UM I GAS THERE WERE SO I I I CAN'T GO THROUGH ALL OF HOM I FORGET UM I GANG OF FOR UM I WAIT TO GANG FOR IT IS I SH I FORGOT WHAT IS IT UM OH I FIND THE DESTENS RARE FIRES A SO I HAD I HAD LIKE TEN THERE WERE JUST GON  IF ANY OF THOSE PLAY IT'S I'M GOING TO MAKE IT AND AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF AND THAT'S AS LONG AS I MEAN TO TRY IT BEFORE I TOO TIRED CHOO LISTEN IN THE WAREHOUSE FOR YOU LISTENING IN W EREHOUSE ON RANDOM AND THEN A THE SONG THAT I MADE IT TO WAS A OFF OF THAT PRODEGYALBUM FOUT OF THE LAMB AAND IT'S CALLED CLIMATIZES ISTER MANNEL I USE IT FOR A BIRD HOUSE AT IT WHEN FOREWONE ONE WAS THE THING AND WHEN WERE THESE LITTLE LIKE BIDDIO USE LETTER TYPE THINGS YET ANYWAY THOH WHEN THAT SONG CAME ON I I WAS FEELING AT I MADE IT FANTASTIC I LOVE THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE NEROU SCIENTISTS IND ME IS IMMEDIATELY CAN SAYYOU A WE HAVE THIS BRAIN THAT LOVES TO TAKE AN INFORMATION AND DI SCARD OTHER INFORMATION BUT PAIRED ASSOCIATION ITS SO STRONG YEAND WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH SOME SENSE OF REWARD LIKE THE MAKING OF THE VERY OLD BELOW COPING AS THE I AS A EARLY IN LIFE R MAKING THE FIVE FORTYETHS AS A COME BACK TO YOU KNOW THE INJURY AFTER THE ENJUR IS ALMOST LIKE  I LOVED ALL THAT MUSIC BUT I WAS INDOCINATED BY THROUGH THE SCAPEHARKS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SOUND TRACK TO THE SCATE WAS IT WAS PUMP MUSIC IT WAS SEX PRISTILS AND AND NINE NINE NINE BLACK FLAG AND DEVO AND ACTS BASCOKS AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT WAS THAT'S WHAT I KEPT HEARING AND THAT'S WHAT I ASSOCIATE WITH MY BEST OF TIMES IT'S IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM YET YE OTHERS A A FEW VOICES YOU KNOW BRANSOD AND TIM ARMSTRONG AND AND THE AORATION I OPERATION I E TSOUND TIST TE ENO SYSTEM WAS ON THAT PLAYLES WAS ON THE FIVE FORTY PLAYLES ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW  TIM WILL BE SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT AND MATFREEMIN THE BASEBLODER AND JESSE MICHAELS IS NOW PLAYING AGAIN WITH TIM RIE SINGER ABOUT THEIR AYAAN YOU OM THE NEW GIG WHAT'S TO CALL THEY HAD A NAME AND THE THE THEY A THEY CHANGED IT OH INITIALLY IT WAS A WHY DON'T I SAY CAUSE THEY CHANGE TO THER ARESI BUT WE KNOW AWAY I KNOW THER MAKING M MUSIC YAT WHICH IS AMAZING ORATION I WAS INCREDIBLE MY YEAR BOOK PHOTO FOR I THINK TWO YEARS RUNNING WAS THE COVER OF OPERATION IVI TO THAT IN SHORT FOR THE YEAR BOOK PHOTO SPEAKING OF WHICH DID YOU SHO UP FOR YEUR BOOK PHOTOES OR DID YOU GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL BATN'T GO TO ANY OF THE EVENTS PROM OR ANY OF THE AUXILIARY I DIDN'T KNOW I MEAN I WAS I WAS NOW CAST LIKE I WAS NOT EVEN THOUGH I HAD SUCCESS IN SCATING SCATING WASN'T COOL A AND I WAS NOT HOMYS WITH ANYONE AT SCHOOL EXCEPT FOR TWO OTHER SCATERS AND WE FELT VERY OSTRACISE SO YE I DID SHOW UP FOR THE GRADUATION  CAUSE MY MOMADAN WANT TO SEE IT ET LIKEWISE I GRADUATE BUT I COULD TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE CURBES IN THE PARKIN LOT OF MY HIGH SCHOOL THAN ACED ABOUT ANYTHIN HAPPEN  AN I BROKE SO MANY SPRINKLAR HEADS BECAUSE THE SPRINGLE HEADS WERE RIGHT NEXT TO THE CURB ANDTHERE WAS A DOUBLE SIDED CURB AND SO IF YOU BORE SLIDE ECAUSE I'D GO THER EARLY ON BOARD A SLIDE AND THEN ID JUST LIKE LEAIN TOO FAR IN TO BREAK THE SPRINKLEHEAD AND NEVER GOT CAUGHT WHAT HIGH SCHOOL AHWELL I WENT TO A COUPLE I WENT TO SARA HIGH SCHOOL ORIGINALLY AM THEN I WENT TO A SANDYI GUITO HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS IN NORTH COUNTY AND THEN I ENDED UP A TORY PINES I GOT SO BULLY THAT SANDY GUITO THAT I REQUESTED TO BE TRANSFERRED BECAUSE I I COULDN'T GO I COULDN'T SURVIDE THERE AS THE SCATER I WOULD HAVE TO HIDE MY SCAPEBOARD IN THE BUSHES BEFORE CLASS AND THEN GO FIND IT AFTER SCHOOL SO THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T TARGED ME THE EIGHTESEWARD AH ITWAS LIKE A DOHT I IT WAS LIKE A JOHN HES FIL IT WA FOR SHU O DOIID IT WAS JOSOPHERS'S NERVES AND THEN SKATERS WERE LIKE NOT EVEN CONSIDERED IN THAT REALM BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST CONGET THEY'RE GETING AT HAMMERED CAUE THE WERE SO FEW OF US WHETL THINGS OF CHANGE AND NOT ONLY HAVE THINGS HAVE CHANGED SUCH THAT SCAPE WOARDING IS FAR MORE POPULAR AND RESPECTED AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST ONE MARK OF THAT AS IN THE OLYMPICS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER MARKS OF RESPECT CERTAINLY BUT A HUGE EVOLUTION THAT I'VE OBSERVED IS WHEN I WAS SCAPEBOARDING IS A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD AN IT YOU KNOW INTO MY CLOSE TO MY TWENTIES AN THN TOOK SOME TIME OFF FOR SURE AM HARDLY ANY GIRLS HARDLY ANY WOMEN THERE WERE A FEW LIKE CARABATH BURNT SIDE THEY GOT TEASED RIDICULED IT WAS HARD ON THAT ZUBRAR YV SUBERHARD NOW LARGELY THROUGH IN SEREM AM BUT SOME OTHER CHANNELS AS WELL YOU CAN SEE THIS YOUNG GIRL RESE ONVER SCAPEWOARDING BETTER THAN A LOT OF GROWN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN SCAPEWOARDING FOR DECADES I IMEAN UM AND THEN THERE A NUMBER OF OTHER ONES IN THE A IN STREET SCAPEWOARDING UM AND ALSO TAKING REALLY HARD SLAMS I YOU KNOW SO THIS THIS IS A COMPLETE REVISION OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF SCAPEWOARDING ALL  HAE THOUGHTS ON THAT AND UM ON  E SEND THERE A FEW OTHERS WAS IT IS IT AM LIZZY WHO IMO TE TOOK A REALLY BAD FA THAT WAS FILMED FOR  TER FORTHE A NACK OFF FOR PEMERIA YET THESE ARE' TOUF LADIES YEA I'M YOU DOING IT AND FOR COMING BAK IS HE LIZZIY DID THE LOOP SHE DID THE FOLL THROUGH SIXTY LOO FIRST WOMAN EVER DO IT UM SO WOULD YOU THINK CHANGED LIKE THIT THAT PAVED THE WAY S IT JUST U NO A CRITICAL MASS OF O FEMALES DOING IT IS IT THAT UM YOUR SKY BROWN YOU KNW YOU FOR SURE FOR SURE THERE WERE THERE WERE THE PIONEERS PEOPLE LIKE CARABOUT WERE INSIDE UM AND I I SO MANY OTHERS UM PATTY HOFFMAN WAS ONE OF ONE THE FIRST VIRSTCATORS TOO WHO WERE THEY PLANTED THE SEET AND AND THEN THERE WERE OTHER WOMEN THAT TOOK CONSPIRATION LIKE O GIRLS CAN' DO THIS EVEN THOUGH THERE LARGELY OUTNUMBERED AND THEY GET HOSTELED FOR SURE AND THEN THROUGH THE STREET ERA A PEOPLE LIKE A LIZE STEAMER WHO WHO PAID THE WAY FOR LEGIT STREET SCATING UM BUT THEN THROUGH THE YEARS IT IT STARTED TO BECOME MORE COMMON MORE ACCEPTED WHICH IS DUM TO SAY CAUSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ACCEPTED BUT THE THING THAT THAT REALLY TIPP THE SCALE WAS WHEN EVERYTHING WAS LEADING UP TO LYMPICS THERE HAD TO BE EQUAL DIVISIONS IN EQUAL DISCIPLINES FOR MEN AND WOMEN AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO QUESTION SHOULD WE HAVE A SHOULD WE HAVE A WOMEN'S EVENT LIKE H WE HAVE TO HAVE OMANSVEN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE THAT'S THE ROAD TO QUALIFYING FOR THIS THE OLYMPIC STAGE AND VANS PART SERIOUS TO THEIR CREDIT THEY WERE HOLDING EVENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY NOT THAT WE'RE LIMPID QUALIFIERS BUT JUST THEIR OWN AND THEY SAID THESE EVENTS ARE EQUAL ACROSS THE BOARD EQUAL PRIZE MONEY EQUAL ATTENTION AND MEE HAV JUST LIKE THAT WAS JUST MATTER OF FACT ND THAT SHIFTED A LOT IT REALLY DID NOW IF YOU GO TO ESCAPE PART YOU SEE PLENTY WOMAN THERE THER IT'S ALL N WENT LIKE LITERAL WOMEN LIKE MAMS YOU KNOW THE FRS THERE ARE OLDER WOMEN THAT ARE LEARNING HOW TO SCAPE SAWSON NOT THAT IT MATTER SO MUCH BUT DOES ANY ONE CLAIM TO BE THE FIRST FEMALE DO FIVE FORTY ONVERT IS THAT SORT OF A KNOWN  THAT OUL E LINSEYATAMS ENTASTIC AM AND SHE DID THAT O TA HOW SHE DID THAT SHE WAS TRYING IT AM SO SHE IS TRYING SHE'S TRYING TO MATWIS AH SHE'S MARRIED TO TRAVES PASTRONA ITS LIKE THE UNO IT'S LIKE THE THE A LEED ACTION SPORTS COUPLE AM AND SHE WAS TRYING UP SHE WAS SHE WAS GETTIG PRETTY CLOSE AND THAND WE DID A BIG EXHIBITION IN PARIS AT THE A GRAND PALAIT ON BEHALF OF QUICKSILVER IT WAS A HUGE EVENT OONLY PUT HALF PIPOB AND WE DI THIS GIANT SHOW THER THOUSANDS PEOPLE THERE AND IT WAS VERY MUCH AM UNSPOKEN BUT EXPECTED THAT I WAS GOING TO DO NINE HUNDRED AT THIS EVENT OMA HE GIVAS I WONT TO SAY WAS TWO THOUSAND TEN MAYME AND A ARE NO LIKE TWO THOUSAND NINE AND AND AND THE ORGANIZE  KIND OF LI CASE WR CAN DO THIS AND THEN YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT YOU DO NINE HUNDRED KNOSIK I I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT EVER LIKE EVERY TIME I'VE EVER MADE IT IT'S BEEN PRETTY SPONTANEOUS I YOU KNOW I'VE SET OUT TO DO IT AND NOT OF COME UP SHORT I CAN'T GUARENTEE IT I'LL TRY I'LL TRY AND THEY THEYRE LIKE YEOKE AN SO I KNEW THE WHOLE TIME THET WERE SCADING AS IOGA ON EXPECTING TUS SO I KIND IM WENT TROUGH THE MOTIONS OF OF A IT'S DOING MY EXHIBITION TRICKS YOU KNOW PLAIN THE HITS AND THEN STARTED SHYIN NINE HUNDREDS AND AT THE SAME TIME LINDSEY STARTED THYING FIVE FORTIES CAUSE SHE WAS FEELING OT ENERGY AND SO IT WAS THIS SORT OF NOT BATTLE BUT DEFINITELY WE WERE WE WERE TRADING HIDS IT WAS LIKE RI YOU'RE GUST DAS AN TE A YO MISSED IT AND YOU'RE GOS LINDSEY A SHE MISSED IT AND THEN I A SHE ALMOST MADE ONE LIKE WAS RIDING DOWN YOU KNOW AND AND THEN FELL AT THE FLAT BOTTOM IT WAS LIKE AWH AND THEN I MADE E NINE HUNDRED AND THET WAS KIND OF THE SHOW STOPP ER  I GOT THE EXPECTED AND I ONS ONE CRAZY AN WHATEVER PEOPLE ARE COMING DOWN OFF THE RAMP KNEE SLIDING DOWN AND WERE STAYING GOOD BY TO THE CROWD AND I LOOK UP AND LINDSEY PUTS HER TAIL OUT THERE'E STILL PEOPLE STANDING ON THE RAMP AND SHE PUTS HER TAIL OUT NI WAS LIKE I THINK LINDSEY MUST TRY IT AGAIN HERE WE  I'M ON THE LIKE NEW SHE MADE IT LOV IT SHE STOLE THE SHOL  LIKE WITHOUT QUESTION IT WAS HUGE  YOU LOOK IT UP ON ON YOU SEE IP I GETS THERE LINSEY OTAMS FIRST FIRST FIVE FORTY IT WAS ALSOM AND THEN SHE MADE IT AND WE ALL GRAPP HER N PUT HER HUNDHERS SHOULDERS THAT IS AL SAVES FOR THE GOL THERE'S ASSOM CAUSE THESE THINGS ARE LIKE THE FOUR MINUTE MYLE AS I I EER HER THEM PEOPLE BREAK THAT BERRIER AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE BREAK THAT BERRIER IT'S I MAY I I WATCHED ENOUGH ESCAPE WOAT ING RECENT YEAR SEE YOU KNOW LIKE THE SKY BROWN THAING O WHEN SHE'S PHENOMENAL AND AS SHE SAW HER FAMILY OUT TO DINNER HERE AN LOLSANGELISAND UNC WITH HER BROTHER AND  FOLKS ARE REALY GRACIOUS REALLY NICE AND THERE AGAIN YOUR PARENTS GOING TO THE SCAPEPARK WE AFTER ALL SHE'S COULDN'T DRIVE HERSELF I THING SHE YET THAT TIME SO  BN NIN ON E  PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHIFTS TOO IS THAT PARENTS ENCOURAGE THEIR KISS ESKAPE NOW COAND YOU IMAGINE THAT WHEN WE ARE YOUNG NEVER NO THERE WERE SO MANY FACTORS TELLING US NOT TO WHICH I MADE US WANTO DO IT MORE SURE WY NIN NOW NOW KIDS ARE LIKE PARENTS ARE PUSHING THEM INTO IT GET OUT THERE LEARN TRICKS SA WAIY THAT'S NOT RISTLESS BE DOING BUT IT'S COOL THAT THAT I THINK I THINK WITH TE THE THE REALLY COOL FACTOR OF ALL THAT IS THERE ARE DEFINITELY PEOPLE OUR AGE I I'M GROUPING YOU INTO MY AGE CATIC BY FORTY SEVEN ARE I NEW AS NOT UM BUT BUT TED HAVE KIDS AND AND SCAPE WEING WITH SUCH A SPECIAL TIME IN OUR LIFE AND THEN THEY'RE RE DISCOVERING IT THROUGH THEIR KIDS AND THEIR SCATING TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S JUST SO AMAZE THAT SOME ONE OF OUR AGE WOULD BE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I USED TO DO THAT YOU'R IN TO THAT LYK LET'S GO AND THEN YOU CALD SHOW YOUR KID OUT TO THE SWEEPER I CAN PRIDE YOU THAT ION KIDS YET BUT WHEN I DO I'LL SHO I INTEND ON BEING HEALTHY ENOUGH AND YE TO DO A SWEEPER PEOPLE CAN LOOK UP SWEEPER WE DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT FOR HIM BUT LENG LAY BACK GRN OR A SWEEPER YET O YOT BECAUSE THEY WON'T THEY WOULDN'T THINK TO DO IT NO AND THERE ARE DOING ALL THESE DIFFICULT FLIP TRICKS IN TUST OT MY SOME MY SEEING I HEW WHATS YOURE GO TO ON AGAM ESCAPE FEARING A REALLY LIKE TAKE OUT THE YOUNGER GENERY UM I CAN DO IMPOSSIBLES PRETTY I PRETTY REGULARLY ON TRANSITION CONSISTENTLY I KNEW ON FLAT SINC IS WERE BASELY SCRAPE THE BACK OF IT'S AN ALL HE REALY BUT IT RAPS AROUND THE BACK OWHA ORT RADIT OVER YOUR FOOT YE UM THAT'S KIND OF MY M SNEAK ATTACK ON GAM TO SKAPE DOES RAWDNEY MON GET CREDIT FOR THAT TRICKS OH YES THAT'S YOUTS TO RODNEY HE STILL CONTOUCH WITH RADNEY ABSOLUTELY YE YET HES SOMEBODY BIT U SORLY DESERVES IT DESERVES TO MENSION IND THE PIONEERING OF TRICKS THAND CONFEASE THE GODFATHER IN MODERN SKIP WORN I THINK OF RAWDENY Y OU AND MARGANS ALL HIS GONES AS LIKE THEIR GUISE THAT I'M HONORED DROVE THE UM THE PROGRESSION INDIFFERENT PARTIALLY OVERLAPPING DIRECTIONS THAT SET THE TEMPLA FIRST ILEARN FINGELS HADS BECAUSE ROD LIKE THE FIRST TRICK YOU SAW ME DO I LEARN NOT BECAUSE I SAW RODDNY DO IT ON THE GROUND AND I THOUGHT WELL I CAN'T DO ON THE GROUND BUT I'VE PLENTY OF TIME IN THE AIR ANDS TO DO IT SAWSOM SAW SOME THAT STACY PUT YOU GUIDES TOGETHER WE WE MENTIOND BONES FORGAT BUT WE REALLY TALK ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SCAPEWOARD PROGRESSION BUT IT WAS UM COME LIKE ANY GOOD BAND IT SEEME LIKE THERE WAS REALLY GOOD CAMISTRY YE A INTERPERSONALLY BUT ALSO UM THAT THERE WERE EACH PERSON HAD SOMETHING UNIQUE YOU SCATED WAY YOU DID MIKE SCAY THE WAY HE DID STEVIE WHEN HE DID AND YOU KNOW RAWDNEY AND YOU KNOW AND WE RESPECTED EACH OTHER BUT WE ALSO FAT OFF EACH OTHER TOMMY GREAR EP RIGHT  CAUS GRIUP IN THE BEAR LIKE  IN FACT TOMMY SCAIN THEHILLS OF SAN FRANCISCO IN THOSE VIDIOS MAKES IT LOOK EASY A THOSE HILLS ARE AROG THEY'R DANADRESS AND THEY HAVE REAL LIFE OBSTACLES LIKE NIVING BOSSES YOU'LL NOS HE WASN'T STOPPING AS TOALINES SAYS FANTASTIC AH WE COULD REMINISTS ABOUT ALL THESE ANGLES PUT THAT THE POINT BEING THAT UM SPENDING TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO DO SIMILAR THINGS FOR THE SAME THING BUT DO IT DIFFERENTLY IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO PROGRESS THIS WY ROUTINELY FLY TO TAXAS AND HANG OUT WITH PETER TEA ANOTHER PODCASTER LICKES FREEDMEN JUST CAUSE THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLYMEN I DO UM WHERE DO YOU DRAW SORT OF PRIFERAL INSPIRATION FROM NOW THEY I KNOW YOU I SEE JIMMY WELKINS AT YOUR AMP QUEN ALOT THE FENOM JIMY WELCOMS OF EREE HOW GOOD THAT KIT IS UM TWHO ELSE ARE YOU SPEND TIME WITH BESIDES REETHS AND ONE OF THE REASONS I ASKED US IS THAT SCAPEBOARDING IS UNIQUE AMONG MANY SPORTS AN THAT I GIVIN SESSION A GATHERING A TO SCAPEWOARD WE'LL INCLUDE AN ENORMOUS YO VITAN OLD MAN AND TEN YEAR OLD GIRLS EXACTLY YES WHICH IS TT WHICH INCREDIBLE YOU DON'T THING ABOUT SOER YOU A SERIOUS GAME OF SOCKER BENIN PROFESSIONAL SOC BUT ALSO NOT EVEN THAT THAT WERE SCATTING TOGETHER IS THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING AND INFLUENCING EACH OTHER I MEAN THAT IS LIKE THE LAST CONVERSATION I HAVE WITH REASE WAS SHE'S TALKING OUT IKE AR YOUGEN TO TRIED YOUF I FORTY SEEANI GO I'M COING WORKING ON IT SHE IS WHAT I THINK SHE SAW ME TRY WONE SHE CAUSE I THINK CON NEED O COLL OUT A LITTLE MORE AND SHE WAS RIGHT SHE'S HOW OLD AGAN STEN AND I AND I DID EVEN CONSIDER THAT BECAUSE I'M JUST BACK IN MY MOD AND I'M NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT I DON'T HAVE THE SNAP THAT I HAD BEFORE I GOT HER AND SHE WAS RIMING THALWAYS ONE KEY TO BE MAKING IT ANDYOU KNOW DO THAT THAT IS BUT IT BUT TO ME THAT'S JUST TAST REPRESENTATIVE SCAPEBOARDIN AND THE INCLUSIVITY OF IT IN THE DIVERSITY OF IT WHERE IT'S ME I'M FIFTY FIVE THERE'S THIRTY YEAR OLD A PROS THAT ARE AT THE TOP OF THE GAME THERE ARE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD UP INCOMERS MEN WOMEN TEN YEAR OLD GIRL THAT IS DOING FRICKS THAT WE'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF OR WANT TO DO AND IT'S ALL PART OF THE THE WHOLE MIX THAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL WANT IT ASK YOU ABOUT MEMORABELIA NOT A TOPIC THAT I THINK ABOUT MUCH BUT I THINK IN A PRIOR CONVERSATION OFOURS YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE SCAPEWOARD COLLECTORS THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT COLLECT STICKERS ESCAPE WORDS THERE'S A WHOLE MARKET AND WORLD FOR THIS AND IM IN ADDITION TO PEOPLE WANTING SELFIES WITH YOU WHEN THEY SEE YOU I IMAGINE A THERE'S A LONG HISTORY AND CONTINUED TRADITION OF PEOPLE TAKING A PEN PUTTING YOUR HAND A SAND CAN YOU SIGN THIS I BECAUSE  YOU ARE IN THIS A VERY A SMALL BUT VERY A CLEARLY ESTEEM GROUP OF PEOPLE WHERE YOUR SIGNATURE INCREASES THE VALUE OF THINGS SO O A HOW DOES THAT WORK A AND HOW DOES THAT FEEL LIKE IF ESCAPEBORDER WHO IU ARE THERE ARE THE TELL TAL SIGNS OF WHO ISN'N WHO ISN'T RIGHT AH U IF THEY WALK UP TO YOU IN THE L HAY W YOU SIGN THIS DO YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT SIGNING IT OR THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM IN IT AND IF SOMEBODY'S JUST MERELY A COLLECTOR A TRADOR IN THEIR TRYING TO UM BUILT THEIR PORTFOLYO SO TO SPEAK AM YOU CAN PROBLYALSO SENTS THAT SO'ME NOT TRYING TO PUT YOU AIN THE HOT SEAT HERE AH WE'LL DANSYOU CRESTON THROUGH THE YEARS I WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO THAT AND AND I'M HAPPY TO UH ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE SCATERS ARE OR ESCAPE FANS AN WHY NOT IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN THIS KNEW ELEMENTS OF RECELLARS OF PEOPLE THAT JUST GO BY SIGNATER STUB THEY'VE NOTHING TO ESCAPING THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT SCAPEBANING IT ALL THEY JUST WANT TO GET MY SIGNATURE ON AN ITEM AND SELL IT AND THEY USUALLY DO IT ON E BAY OR THROUGH THEIR OWN CHANNELS UH THAT'S FINE AT SOME POINT LIKE A FEW YEARS AGO I RESPECTED THE HUSTLE THESE GUIS ARE THEY KNEW THAT I WAS GING TO BE AT THIS EVENT OQET THEIR OUTSIDE WAITING THEY'VEBEENWAITING FOR HOURS I I'LL SIGN A COUPLE OF THINGS BUT IN RESON MONTHS EVEN THEY HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO OU GET MY FLIGHT INFO LIKE SOME HACKED INTO MY MY ACTUAL AIRLINE ACCOUNTS SOME HAVE A SOURCES AT CERTAIN AIRPORTS THAT GET THE MANIFEST AND THEY SELLEBAT INFORMATION I'VE FOUND ALL THE SOUT BECAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY HELD A COUPLE OF MACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE I SAID LOOK I'M NOT IN A SIGN THIS UNTIL YOU TELL ME HOW YOU KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE ERE I HAVE NO BUSINESS HERE I'M HERE TO VISIT FAMILY NO ONE KNOWS I'M COMING HERE OH WO WE SAW O FRIENDS SAID THEY SAW YOU AT THE A DETROYED AIR POIT LIKE NOBOTEY DIDN'T THEY WOULDN'T KNOW WHRE I'M GOING TO ANYWAY O GOI SAWHT ON TWITTER YOU DIDN'T SEE IT ON TO IT I'M ON TO ITTER TELL ME THE TRUTH THERE'S A GUIR FROM TEMS O YOU TO GIVES FLAT AND PHONY SULTED TO US OQE THANK YOU BUT THAT HAS INCREASE TO A POINT WHERE IT'S IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE I CAN'T I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE THE LAST TIME I FLEW OUT OF CHICAGO THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE ONE GUY HAD A A SHOPPING CART FULL OF SCAPEBOARDS AND THEY ALL THEY ALL BUMRUSHED ME AT SECURITY BEFORE I WENT THROUGH SECURITY THINKING THAT I'M IN A SIGNS O MCIASI CAN'T I CAN'T DO I UNMIS MY FLIGHT AND I CAN'T DELINEATE WHO LIKE III'M SORRY YOU GOS HIVE LIKE SABVATIZE YOURSELVES I DONT NOWHAT TO SAY AND THEN I WENT THROUGH SECURITY AND THERE WERE FORDUS WINING AT THE GATE THEY HAD BOUGHT TICKETS AROLINE TICKETS SO THAT IT COULD BE PAST SECURITY THAT THEY AROLINE TICK IS THEIRE NOCKING TO YUSE TO CHASE THIS SO BU I MA WAN'T PEOPLE ON MY AUTOGRAPH BUT IT'S WEIRD AND IT'S INTRUSIVE AND IT'S COUNTA CREEPY YET JUST TELL THEM THAT A NEROU SCIENTISTS TOLD YOU THAT YOU GOT TO GET THAT SLAW BEAR RIGHT AND IF YOU SIGN TOO MANY AUTOGRAPHS THAT IN RMEN ON MY CHANCE OF GETTING BACK YOU'RE NOCKIN THE AT TOCK NE NO JUST NOCKIN BE DO THE FLATENY INVER IT JUST NOCKIN AGAINY WITIT IS IT'S JUSST A REALLY WEIRD YOUN THAND IS HAV YARD HAS POPPED UP AND U OTHER THAN THAT AND AND SO THE TRICKY PARTIES WHEN THERE IS A PUBLIC THING OR A PUBLIC EXHIBITION WHATEVER TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS THE TRUE SCAPE HANS AND WHO AREN'T USUALY THEIR PRETTY IDENTIFIABLE BUT IT IT JUST IT HAS RUINED THE EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE WHO TRULY ARE THE GRUBSCATING WEL THANKS FOR SHARING THAT AND EM WE WON'T TELL EVERY ONE WHAT THE TELL TELL SIGNS ARE SO THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T EXPLOIT THEM THE SCAPE WORDERS THE I REAL FANS WELL NOW A I THEY WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER NOT THEY REPRESENT ACCURATELY CAUSE YOU JUST WILL UM ON THE POSITIVE SIDE SOMETHING UP IN ONE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FROM YOU IS YOURE PHILANTHROPIC EFFORTS U I THINK HEAVEN ROSE AH WHOS IN THE TEX ACTOR WAS THE FIRST TO MENTION TO ME THAT YOU YOU GESS HAVE DONE SOME PHILANTHROPY TOGETHER A AND MAYBE 'VE DONE SO MUCH IMTHEBO AS WELL THE GREAT JIM THEBO AWHE BOTH BOTH JIM AND CEAVEN WERE BOARD MEMBERS I JIM IS THE CURRENT BOARD MEMBER OF THE SCAPE HER PROJECT BUT TELLS SA BAT HESCAPE WORD PROJECT AH IT'S IT'S IT'S MINE ON PROFIT AND WE TRY TO DEVELOP PUBLIC SCAPEPARKS AND ARE CERTAIN UNDER SERVED AREAS BUT MORE SO BY BY SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY AND GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES TO DO SO SO GROUPS THAT ARE TRYING TO GET SCAPEPARKS IN TH AREA WE ARE THE RESOURCE CENTER FOR THEM AH WE'LL GIVE THEM ADVICE WILL GIVE THEM FUNDING WELL GIVE THEM A OUR STAMP OF APPROVAL AND THAT CAN GO ALONG WY AND A TO DATE WE'VE HELPED TO FUND OVER ALMOST THE THOUSAND SCAPEPARKS NOW AND SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED OF WHICH ARE OPEN  I MASE MY PROTESTORK FOR SIRE AND AND IT'S BECAUSE I NEVER I NEVER TOOK FOR GRANTED THE FACT THAT I GP NEAR ESCAPEPARK AND THAT WAS MY HOME WAY FROM HOME THAT WAS WHERE I FOUND MY SENSE OF COMMUNITY MY SENSE OF IDENTITY MY MY CREW AND SO MANY KIDS CHOOSE THE SCAPE OR BUT HAVE NO SUPPORT IN DOING SO AND SO THOSE SCAPEPARKS ARE A LIFE ONE I CAN ATTUST THEY THEY ABSOLUTELY SAVE LATS THEREIS NO QUESTION WHERE CAN PEOPLE FIND OUT MORE ABOUT YOUR FOUNDATION WE CAN PROVIDE A LINK BUT WHAT FIN O HARKED OUT OR ITSO WHERE DOES THE FUNDING FOR THESE PARKS I SHALLY COME FROM AH IT COMES FROM DONATIONS FROM SUPPORTERS IT COMES FROM FUN RAISERS SOME CORPORATE AH SOMETIMES FUNDING IS IS FUNDELED THROUGH US FOR SPECIFIC RESIONS AH LIKE THE A AH WE HAVE A BUILT TO PLAY A PROJECT THATS IN A MICHIGAN IN NEW YORK AND THAT'S FUNDED BY THE RALPH SU WILSON JUNIOR FOUNDATION AHM SO THEY THEY GIVE US THE FUNDING AND THEN WE HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THAT AREA BUT BUT IT'S EASY BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF PROJECTS AND NOW THERE'S AN ABUNDANCE OF SCAPE PARTIONAS EREAS WELL IT THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT FOR RLIZING AROUND THAT IS AND I CA GET MO PLACE TO SCAPE A CURIOUS WHAT'S IN THE

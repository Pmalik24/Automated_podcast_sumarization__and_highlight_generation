WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAO SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO I MAY DRHUBERMEN AND O ROPROFESSOR OF NAURBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDISIN TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING AGGRESSION I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THEREARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGRESSION FOR INSTANCE REACTIVE AGGRESSION VERSES PROACT OF AGRESSION MEANING SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL BE AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE THEY FEEL THREATENED OR THEY ARE PROTECTING THOSE THAT THEY LOVE WHO ALSO FEEL THRETTEN THEREIS ALSO PROACT IVE AGGRESSION WERE PEOPLE GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO DELIBERATELY TRY IN HARM OTHERS AND THERE IS INDIRECT AGGRESSION WHICH IS AGRESSION NOT INVOLVING PHYSICAL VIOLENCE FOR INSTANCE SHAMING PEOPLE AND THINGS OF THAT SORT IT TURNS OUT THAT THEIR DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING EACH OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGGRESSION AND TO DAY I WILL DEFINE THOSE FOR YOU I'LL TALK ABOUT THE NARAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT MEDIATE EACH OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF AGRESSION TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE HORMONES AND PEPTIDES AND NRO TRANSMITTERS INVOLVED I PROMISE TO MAKE IT ALL ACCESSIBLE TO YOU EVEN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY BIOLOGY OR SCIENCE BACKGROUND I ALSO DISCUSSED TOOLS PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS AND BIOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT ONE CAN USE TO BETTER CONTROL AGGRESSION NOW RIGHT HERE AT THE OUTSET I WANT TO AGKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT AGRESSION HAS TO HAVE AN ELEMENT OF CONTEXT WITHIN IT TO BE FAIR HUMAN BEINGS INVEST A LOT OF MONEY A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF ENERGY AND INDEED CAN EVEN DIRIVE PLESSURE FROM AGGRESSION LATER ALL TALK ABOUT NARRL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT REENFORCE IN OTHER WORDS REWARD THROUGH THE RELEASE OF CHEMICALS THAT MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ACTS OF AGRESSION HOWEVER WHAT I'M MAINLY REFERRING TO IS THE CONTECTS IN WHICH HUMAN BEINGS WILL PAY MONEY IN ORDER TO DERIVE WHAT WE CALL VICARIOUS AGGRESSION PUT IT SIMPLY PEOPLE SPEND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND TIME AND ENERGY WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE ENGAGE IN FOR INSTANCE AGGRESSIVE SPORTS AND WE KNOW THAT OBSERVING YOUR TEEM WINNING OVER ANOTHER TEEM CAUSES THE RELEASE OF NARROW CHEMICALS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD AND YES THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL MORE AGGRESSIVE WE ALSO KNOW OF COURSE THAT MOST GOVERNMENTS IN VEST MANY BILIONS IF NOT TRILLINGS OF DOLERS IN INFOR STRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND HUMAN BEINGS IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN AGGRESSION IF NEEDED SO CALLED MILITARY WARFARE ET CETERA SO TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF AGGRESSION IN THE PATHOLOGICAL SENSE WHIL ATUALLY TALK ABOUT AN EXPLOSIVE AGGRESSIVE DISORDER THAT MOST OF YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD OF BUT IS UCHA FAR MORE COMMON THAN PERHAPS YOU KNO WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE ROLEL OF THINGS LIKE ATTENTION DEFIS HYPORACTIVITY DISORDER AND HOW THAT CAN RELATE TO AGGRESSION THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMPULSIVITY AND AGGRESSION AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT VERBAL AGGRESSION PHYSICAL AGGRESSION PROACTIVE AGGRESSION AS MENTION BEFORE AND REACT OF AGGRESSION I'M CERTAIN T AT BY THE END OF THE EPISODE YOU WILL COME AWAY WITH THE MUCH MORE THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS THING THAT WE CALL AGGRESSION REALLY IS AND WHEN YOU SEE IT IN OTHER PEOPLE I THINK IT WILL MAKE MORE SENCE TO YOU AND WHEN YOU OBSERVE IT IN YOURSELF OR THE IMPULSE TO ENGAGE IN AGGRESSION VERBAL OR PHYSICAL OR OTHERWISE I HOPE THAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND IT BETTER AS WELVE AND OF COURSE THE TOOLS THAT I WILL DESCRIBE SHOULD ALLOW YOU TO MODULATE ND CONTROL AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES OR PREDISPOSICIONS TO AGGRESSIVENESS AND JUST GENERALLY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE IN A MORE ADAPTIVE WAY OVER ALL BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS  LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OURE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMIN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GRENSTOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR IVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES IN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPERATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH IN ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLYHTS IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENTE DOCAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTE DOCAM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT AGGRESSION I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE PUT OFF BY AGGRESSION ALTHOUGH OTHERS ARE DRAWN TO AGGRESSION BOTH IN THEMSELVES AND WHEN OBSERVING IT IN OTHERS THE REASON TO TALK ABOUT AGGRESSION IS THAT AS MENTION BEFOR THE CONTEXT OF AGGRESSION REALLY MATTERS SO THERE RE INCTANCES WHERE AGGRESSION IS ADAPTIVE FOR INSTANCE A MOTHER PROTECTING HER CHILDREN IF SHE'S BEING ATTACKED OR F FOR CHILDREN ARE BEING THREATEND I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGGREE THAT SO CALLED MATERNAL AGGRESSION OF THAT SORT PROVIDED THE CONTEXTS RIGHT IS AGGREAT THING PROTECTING ARE YOUNG IS AFTER ALL ONE OF THE PRIMARY ADAPTIVE DRIVES OF OUR SPECIES AND THINK GOODNESS IT IS OF COURSE OTHER FORMS OF AGGRESSION LIKE UNPROVOKED PROACT OF AGRESSION SOMEBODY SIMPLY BEING VIOLENT TO SOMEBODY ELSE EVEN WHEN UNPROVOKED MOST OF US CRINGE WHEN WE SEE THAT CON OF BEHAVIOR IT CAN EVEN EVOKE AGGRESSION IN PEOPLE WHEN THEY OBSERVE THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR SO AGAIN CONTEXT REALLY MATTERS BUT A MORE GENERAL AND PERHAPS AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT REASON TO THINK ABOUT AND UNDERSTAND AGGRESSION IS THAT BY UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY OF AGGRESSION YOU WILL BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL EMOTIONAL STATES COME TO BE BOTH IN YOURSELF AND IN OTHERS FOR INSTANCE MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THE STATEMENT THAT I BELIEVE ARISES FROM POP PSYCHOLOGY NOT FROM FORMAL ACADEMIC PSYCHOLOGY THAT AGGRESSION IS JUST SADNESS IT'S A FORM OF SADNESS THAT'S AMPLIFIED AND IT SHOWS UP AS AGGRESSION BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY AND THE PURE REVIEW LITERATURE ON THIS NOTHING CAN BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH WE HAVE DISTINCT CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN FOR AGGRESSION VERSES GRIEF AND MOURNING THOSE ARE NONOVERLAPPING NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T BE SAD AN AGGRESSIVE OR IN A STATE OF MOURNING AN AGGRESSIVE AT THE SAME TIME BUT THE IDEA THAT SADNESS AND AGRESSION ARE ONE AN THE SAME THING IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE AND BY UNDERSTANDING THAT OR PERHAPS BY UNDERSTANDING THAT IRRITABILITY AND AGGRESSION ARE NOT THE SAME THING YOU'LLBE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO APPLY SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT IN THIS EPISODE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OR IF IT'S ADAPTIVE TO YOU TO MODULATE AGGRESSION AND YES THERE ARE CASES WHERE MODULATING YOUR AGGRESSION IN SOME CASES EVEN AMPLIFYING AGGRESSION CAN BE ADAPTIVE NOW THIS OF COURSE IS NOT THE FIRST DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF AGGRESSION WHERE THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AGRESSION AND WE REALLY CAN LOOK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST CENTURY AS THE TIME IN WHICH THE FORMAL STUDY OF AGGRESSION REALLY BEGAN ONE OF THE NAMES THAT'S MOST ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMAL STUDY OF AGGRESSION IS NONE OTHER THAN CONRAD LORENS SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT NAME OTHERS OF YOU MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT NAME CONRAD LORENS STUDIED SO CALLED IMPRINTING BEHAVIORS AND FIXED ACTION PATTERN BEHAVIORS HE'S MOST FAMOUS AT LEAST IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES FOR GETTING GEESE TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS THEIR PARENT AND IF HEU WERE TO PUT INTO GUGOLL CONRAD WITH A CAY LORENS JUST AS IT SOUNDS CONRADE LEREND GEESE YOU GONG TO SEE A LOT OF PHOTOS OF CONRAD WALKING DOWN ROADS WITH A LOT OF GEESE FOLLOWING HIM ORE SWIMMING IN LAKES WITH A LOT OF GEESE FOLLOWING HIM HE ET A HABIT OF GEESE ADOPTING HIM BECAUSE OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT HE PARTOOK IN SO HE WOULD SWIM OUT ON A LAKE IN FRONT OF A BUNCH LOW GEESE AND THEN THEY WOULD THINK THAT HE WAS THE PARENT AND THY WOULD IMPRINT ON HIM HEVEN LIVED WITH THESE ANIMALS AND THEY LIVED WITH HIM TO A STRANGE CHARACTER FROM WHAT I HEAR BUT NONE THE LESS ALL THIS WORK WAS DESERVING A NOF A NOBELL PRIZE BECAUSE WHAT HE DISCOVERED WERE FIXED ACTION PATTERS THAT IS PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR THAT COULD BE EVOKED BY A SINGLE STIMULUS A THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN GET A WHOLE CATEGORY OF BEHAVIORS LIKE SWIMMING BEHIND A PARENT OR LOOKING TO SOMEBODY FOR COMFORT AND ONLY THEM THE IDEA THAT THAT YOU COULD GET A HUGE CATEGORY OF DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CONTECTS TRIGGERED BY JUST THE PRESENCE OF THAT PERSON IS REMARKABLE BECAUSE WHAT IT SUGGESTED IND WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE IS THAT THERE ARE NERL CIRCUITS NOT JUST INDIVIDUAL BRAINAR IS BUT COLLECTIONS OF BRAINAIR IS THAT WORKE TOGETHER TO ENGAGE A PATTERN OF BEHAVIORS AND THAT'S THE FIRST FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT WE NEED TO DEFINE TO DAY THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OGGRESSION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTIVATION OF NERL CIRCUITS NOT INDIVIDUAL BRAINAR IS BUT NERL CIRCUITS THAT GET PLAYED OUT IN SEQUENCE LIKE HEES ON A PIANO BUT THAT PLAYING OUT IN SEQUENCE MEANS THAT AGGRESSION IS A VERB HAS A BEGINNING A MIDDLE AN AN END AND IT'S A PROCESS IT'S NOT AN EVENT AND AS YOU'LL SEE THAT TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW ONE CAN HALT OGGRESSION PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING BEFORE IT'S INITIATED OR ABE EVEN PROLONGING AGGRESSION IF THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED NOW CONRAD LERENS HAD NO REAL NOWLEDGE OF NERL CIRCUITS I MEAN OBVIOUSLY HE KNEW THERE WAS IS THING THAT WE CALL A BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HE KNEW THAT THERE WERE CHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN AND HORMONS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THAT WERE LIKELY TO PLAY A ROLE BUT HE REALLY DIDN'T TAKE ANY MEASURES TO DEFINE WAT THE NERL CIRCUITS WERE FRANKLY DIDN'T NEED TO BE THAT IS NOBLL PRIZE AND HE DID ALL THIS BEAUTIFUL WORK HEIS KNOWN FOR AN ABUNDANCE OF WORK BUT HE DID THINK ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF UNDERLYING PROCESSES COULD DRIVE SOMETHING LIKE AGGRESSION AND HE TALKED ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR FEATURE THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S THIS NOTION OF OPPRESSIURE THE IDEA THAT YES CERTAIN HORMONS WILL BIAS SOMEBODY OR AN ANIMAL TO BE AGRESSIVE CERTAIN AR TRANSMITER STATES AND YOUL LEARN WHAT THOSE ARE TO DAY WILL BUY A SOMEBODY TO BE MORE OR LESS AGGRESSIVE MAYBE EVEN SUBMISSIVE AND PASSIVE MAY BE OUTRIGHT PROACTIVELY AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS ANY ONE ORE ANYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM AND YES OF COURSE THERE WILL BE HISTORICAL FEATURES BASED ON THEIR CHILDHOOD ET CETERA ET CETERA HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WILL BE A CONSTELLATION OF THINGS THAT WOULD DRIVE PEOPLE TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND HE DESCRIBED O SO CALLED PRESSURE ALMOST LIKE A HYDRAULIC PRESSURE JUST THING ABOUT FLUID PRESSURE IN A SMALL CONTAINER BEIN PUSH PUSH PUSH UNTIL THE CAN OR THE CONTAINER IS READY TO EXPLODE AND HOW MULTIPLE FEATURES MULTIBLE VARIABLES COULD IMPINGE ON THAT AND CREATE THAT PRESSURE IT TURNS OUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY THAT SYSTEM WORKS THERE IS NO SINGLE BRAIN AREA THAT FLIPS THE SWITCH FOR AGGRESSION ALTHOUGH WE'LL SOON TALK ABOUT A BRAIN STRUCTURE THAT GENERALLY HOUSES THE PROPENSITY AND THE OUTPUT OF AGGRESSION THIS NOTION OF A HYDRAULIC PRESSURE THAT CAN DRIVE US TOWARD AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OR CONVERSELY CAN BE VERY LOW PRESSURE AND KEEP US IN A STATE OF NON REACTIVITY MAY BE VEN PASSIVITY OR SUBMISSIVENESS IS AF VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE BECAUSE IT REALLY CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF HOWNERL CIRCUITS WORK WHEN WERE TALK ABOUT PRIMITIVE BEHAVIORS GENERALLY AND YOU CAN START TO NOTICE THIS IN YOURSELF AND IN OTHERS YOU CAN STRART TO NOTICE WHEN YOU ARE VERING TOWARD AGGRESSION OR WHEN SOMEONE IS VERING TOWARD AGGRESSION VERBAL OR PHYSICAL NOW THAT VERING IS THE BUILD UP OF THIS HYDRAULIC PRESSURE THAT LARENDS WAS REFERRING TO AND IT REALLY DOES HAVE AN UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL BASIS NOW IT WAS SOME YEARS LATER THAT THE FIRST EXPERIMENTS CAME ALONG WHICH REALLY TARTED TO IDENTIFY THE BRAIN AREAS AND THE BIOLOGICAL SO CALLED PRESSURES THAT CAN INDUCE AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR AND THE PERSON THAT REALLY GETS CREDIT FOR THIS IS HE GUIDE BY THE NAME OF WALTER CATS WHO AT THAT TIME WAS WORKING ON CATS AND I KNOW THAT WHEN SAY WORKING ON CATS A LOT OF PEOPLE CRINGE A LOTOF POPLE HAVE CATS AS PATS AND CERTAINLY CATS CAN BE DELIGHTFUL SOME PEOPLE LIKE THEM MORE R SOME PEOPLE LIKE THEM LESS MOST PEOPLE CRINGE AT THE IDEA OF L DOING EXPERIMENTS ON CATS I YOU SHOULD SAY THAT THESE DAYS VERY FEW LABORATORIES WORK ON CATS MOST LABORATORIES THAT WORK ON ANIMAL MODELS WILL WORK ON FLIES TROSOPHOLO FRUITFLIES FOR THEIR CAPACITA DU GENETICS ON LABORATORY MICE SOMETIMES RATS BUT USUALLY MICE AND OCCASIONALLY YOU'LL FIND A LAB THAT STILL WORKS ON CATS BACK IN THE TIME OF HATS VERY FEW LABORATORIES WORKED ON MICE MOST LABORATORIES WORKED ON CATS OR RATS AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS NOWDAYS MOST LABORATORIES USE MICE IF THEY USE ANIMAL MODELS BECAUSE OF THE GENETIC TOOLS THAT EXIST IN MICE TO KNOCK OUT THIS GENEARE KNOCK IN THIS GENE ET CETERA WHICH CAN'T BE DONE IN HUMANS OR NON HUMAN PRIVEATES AT LEAST NOT VERY EASILY AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY SO WHEN I SAY HE WAS WORKING ON CATS AND REALIZE THAT PROUBLY EVOKESOME NEGATIVE EMOTIONS IN SOME OF YOU MAYBE EVEN AGGRESSION IN SOME OF YOU WHAT WE CAN DO HOWEVER IS LOOK AT THE DATA AND MAKE USE OF THE DATA IN TERMS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING WHAT HESS DID WAS HE HAD CATS THAT WERE AWAKE AND HE WAS ABLE TO LOWER STIMULATING ELECTROTE INTO THE BRAIN NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT THE BRAIN DOES NOT HAVE ANY PAIN CENSORS SO AFTER A SMALL HOLE IS MADE IN THE SKULL ELECTRODESAR LOWERED INTO THE BRAIN THIS IS WHAT'S DONE COMMONLY IN HUMAN NARROW SURGERY AND HE WAS ABLE TO STIMULATE DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS AND HE WAS SORT OF POKING AROUND AND WHEN I SAY SORT OF HE WAS DOING THIS WITH SOME LOGICAL INTENT AND PURPOSE HE WASN'T JUST POKING ROUND IN THERE FOR FUN HE WAS TRYING TO IDENTIFY BRAIN REGIONS THAT COULD GENERATE ENTIRE CATEGORIES OVE BEHAVIOR ALLAH LORENS WRIGHT THESE FIXED ACTION PATTERN BEHAVIORS EVENTUALLY HIS ELECTRODE LANDED IN A SIGHT AND HE PROVIDED ELECTRICAL STIMULATION TO THE CAT THAT CAUSE THIS OTHERWISE PASSIVE PURRING RELAXING CAT TO SUDDENLY GO INTO AN ABSOLUTE RAGE SO ARCHED BACK HISSING HAIR UP SO CALLED PILO ERECTION WHERE THE HAIRS GO UP ANIMALS TRY TO MAKE THEMSELVES AS BIG AS POSSIBLE OFTEN WHEN THEY AR AGRESSIVE DRUELING MAYBE VEN SPITTING BELIEVE OR NOT CATS AND OTHER ANIMALS CAN DO THIS AND THE CAT TRIED TO ATTACK HIM IN ANY ONE ELSE AND ANYTHING ELSE EVEN INANIMATE OBJECTS WHEN HE STIMULATE THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA SO HESS OBVIOUSLY TOOK NOTICE OF THIS INCREDIBLE TRANSFORMATION IND BEHAVIOR AND THE FACT THAT WHEN HE TURNED OFF THE STIMULATION OF THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA THE CAT VERY QUICKLY WITHIN SECONDS WHENT BACK TO BEING PASSIVE CALM KITTY NOW OF COURSE HE REPEATED THIS EXPERIMENT IN OTHER ANIMALS BECAUSE HE HAD TO CONFIRM THAT IT WASN'T JUST CAPIN STANDS THA THERE WASN'T SOMETHING UNIQUE ABOUT THIS ONE CAT THAT PERHAPS AH HE HAD STIMULATED IN AREA THAT HAD BEEN BUILT UP JURING THE KITTENHOOD OF THIS A OF THIS CAT AND HAD BEEN REACTIVATED MAYBE THIS KITTEN HAD BEEN TROMATIZED EARLY IN LIFE OR SCARED AND A REACTIVATION OF A PARTICULAR CIRCUIT UNIQUE TO THAT CAT A CREATED THIS AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR THAT WASN'T THE CASE EVERY CAT THAT HE LOOKED AT AND STIMULATE THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA THE CAT WOULD IMMEDIATELY GO INTO AN AGGRESSIVE LMOST RAGE TYPT BEHAVIOR N OF COURSE WE CAN'T ENTER PROMORPHIZE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAT WAS FEELING FOR ALL WE KNOW THE CAT COULD BE HAPPIAL THA THAT SEEMS PRETTY UNLIKELY AND LATER EXPERIMENTS DONE IN MICE BUT ALSO IN HUMANS CONFIRMD THAT INDEED STIMULATION OF THIS BRAIN AREA EVOKED NOT JUST BEHAVIORAL AGGRESSION BUT ALSO SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS OF AGGRESSION AND ANGER SO WHAT WAS THIS INCREDIBLE BRAIN AREA OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY WHAT IS THE BRAIN AREA THAT HARBORED THIS INCREDIBLE CAPACITY TO GENERATE AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR IN HESS'S EXPERIMENTS WELL FOR THOSE OF YIOU THAT A REGULAR LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST YOU'LL PROBABLY BE RELIEVED TO KNOW THAT TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME NEW NURAL CIRCUITS OFTHETIMES WE'LL CENTER BACK ON THE A MIGDOLA OR THE PREFONTAL QUARTEX AND THOSE NAMES WILL COME UP AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVEN'T HEARD THEM BEFORE DON'T WORRY IL MAKE IT CLEAR AS TO WHAT THOSE BRANARIES ARE IN WHAT THEY DO BUT TO DAY WE'RE GIN TO TALK ALON ABOUT THE SO CALLED V M H OR VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALEMUS THE VENTRIMEDIOHYPOTHALEMUS IS A NEUCLEUS MEANING A SMALL COLLECTION OF NURONS WHAT ARE NURONS NERVE CELLS AND THAT SMALL COLLECTION OF NURONS THAT WE CALL THE VENTRIMEDIAL HYPOTHALMUS IS TRULY SMALL ITS ONLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NURONS ON ONE SIDE YOUR BRAIN AND A MATCHING ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NURONS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN AND THAT COMBINE THREE THOUSAND NURONS OR SO NOT EXACTLY THREE THOUSAND BUT THREE THOUSAND NURONS OR SO IS SUFFICIENT DEGENERATE AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF THE SORT THAT HESS OBSERVED IN THE CAT AND BELIEVE IT ARE NOT WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY WHOS IN THE ACT OF RAGE OR AN ACT OF VERBAL AGGRESSION OR IN AN ACT OF DEFENSIVE AGGRESSION PROTECTING THEIR FAMILY OR LOVED ONS OR COUNTRY ET CETERA ALMOST CERTAINLY THOSE NURONS ARE ENGAGED IN THAT BEHAVIOR THOSE NURONS ARE PERHAPS EVEN GENERATING THAT BEHAVIOR AND NEXT ILL DESCRIBES SOME EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE DONE JUST RECENTLY WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO BUT LEADING RIGHT UP UNTIL THIS YEAR AND EVEN LAST MONTH THAT KEEP CONFIRMING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT IT IS THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS IN THE VENTRIMEDIO HYPOTHALEMUS THAT ARE BOTH NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT DEGENERATE THE FULL CATALOGUE OF AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS NOW BEFORE I GO FURTHER TO DESCRIBE THE BEAUTIFUL RECENT STUDIES ON THE VM CH THE VENTRIMEDIOHYPOTHALMUS AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF TESTASTRONE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ESTROGEN IN THE ACTIVATION OF AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S SOON TO BE CLEAR TO YOU WHY THAT'S THE CASE ONE EMPHASIZE THAT THE VENTRAMEDIO HYPOTHALMUS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL CARE ABOUT WHY WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT MANY CATEGORIES OF PSYCHI PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS DEVELOPMENT AL DISORDERS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES THINGS LIKE SCHISOPHRENIA PITSTI POSTROMATIC STRESS DISORDER DEPRESSION BORDERLINE PERSONALITY OF DISORDER AND EVEN CERTAIN FORMS OF AUTISM CAN INCLUDE ELEMENTS OF AGGRESSION AND EVEN VIOMENTS NOW  IS CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE THAT AGGRESSION AND VIOMENTS ARE PRESENT IN ALL PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SCHISOPHRENIA REPETIASTIOR DEPRESSION OR AUTISM OR BORDOLINE PERSONALITY ISORDER ABSOLUTELY NOT SAYING THAT HOWEVER IT CAN BE A FEATURE OF THOSE AND IT'S A WELL DESCRIBED FEATURE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSTELLATION OF CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE SUFFER FROM WHEN THEY HAVE THOSE SO THINKING ABOUT THE VM H GOES WAY BEYON JUST UNDERSTANDING BASIC AGGRESSION IN THE CONTACT OF ADAPTIVE AGGRESSION SO YOU KNOW WHEN EARLIER I USE THE EXAMPLE MATERNAL AGGRESSION THAT'S ONE ADAPTIVE FORM OF AGGRESSION IT ALSO CAN BE PATHOLOGIC AGGRESSION MEANI CAN HARM OURSELVES OR OTHERS SO KEEP THIS IN MINE AS WE GO FOR BECAUSE LATER WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC TOOLS DESIGNED TO MODULATE OR PREVENT AGGRESSION IN FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE WITH ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPER ACTIVITY DISORDER AND ESPECIALLY KIDS WITH EIGHTY HT IN THE MEANTIME LET'S RETURN TO THE VIEMAH THIS RELATIVELY SMALL COLLECTION OF NURONS THERERESN I SAY RELATIVELY SMALL AS WELL YOUR BRAIN HAS MANY HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF NURONS MADE EVEN TRILLIANS OF NURONS E EXACT NUMBER OF NURONZ IS IN REALLY CLEAR BUT ITS A LOT AND IT CERTAINLY AS A LOT RELATIVE TO THE NUMBER OF NURONS THIS THREE THOUSAND OR SO NURONS LIVING IN YOUR HYPOTHALMAS THAT CAN EVOKE THIS AGGRESSIVE RESPONSS EXPERIMENTS DONE BY DAVID ANDERSON'S LAV AT CALTEC WERE REALLY THE FIRST TO PARSE THE FINE CIRCUITRY AND TO REALLY SHOW THAT THE VENTRIMEDIA HYPOTHALMUS IS BOTH NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT FOR AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR THESE ARE IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTS IN THEIR WORTH KNOWING ABOUT WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY IDENTIFIED FIRST OF ALL WHERE THE VENTRIMEDIA HYPOTHALMUS WAS IN THE MOUSE THAT WAS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD TO DO A SORT OF KNOWN BEFORE THEY START THESE EXPERIMENTS AND THEN THEY ANALYZED WHICH GENES MEANING WHICH DIANA WHICH OF COURSE BECOMES ARNA AND ARNA BECOMES PROTINE WHICH D'ANA AND THEREFORE WHICH PROTINES ARE EXPRESSED IN PARTICULAR CELLS OF THE VENTRIMEDIAL HYPOTHALEMAS AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF NURONS IN THE VENTRIMEDIA HYPOTHALEMAS THAT MAKE AN ESTROGEN RECEPTOR AND IT IS THOSE NURONS IN PARTICULAR THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR HOW DID THEY KNOW THIS WELL THEY USED THE TOOL THAT 'S ECTUALLY BEN DESCRIBED BY A PREVIOUS GUEST OF THIS PODCAST WE HAD AN EPISODE WITH THE PSYCHITRIST AND BYOENGINEER AND MYCOLLIAT STAMFORD SCHOOL MEDISINE CARL DYCEROTH HE AND OTHERS HAVE DEVELOP TOOLS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONTROL THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS ESSENTIALLY BY REMOTE CONTROL BY SHINING LIGHT ON THOSE NURON SO IN THE CONTECT OF AN EXPERIMENT ON A MOUSE WHICH IS WHAT DAVID SLAP DID AND THESE WERE THE BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS OF DALU LIN WHOS NOW IN HER OWN LABORATORY AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY PUT A LITTLE FIBROPTIC CABLE DOWN INTO THE BRAIN OF THE HYPIT INTO THE HYPOTHALMUS THAT IS OF THE MOUSE THE MOUSEIS ABLE TO MOVE AROUND IN ITS CAGE FREELY MOVING EVEN THAT I HAS A LITTLE TETHER THIS LITTLE WIRES A VERY THIN WIRE AND THAT LITTLE THIN WIRES ACTUALALUE WHAT WE CALL OPTRODE AND THE EXPERIMENTALISTS IN THIS CASE DALU WAS ABLE TO STIMULATE THE TURNING ON OF A LITTLE BIT OF BLUE LIGHT AND THAT BLUE LIGHT ACTIVATED ONLY THOSE ESTROGEN RECEPTER NURON IN ONLY THE VENTRIMEDIAL HYPOTHALEMAS AND THE WA SHE WAS ABLE DO THAT IS Y IT INTRODUCED A GENE THAT HAD BEEN DEVELT BY OUR FRIEND CARLDISEROT THAT A LOUSE LIGHT TO TRIGGER ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY MALES NUROUS SO IF ANY OF THAT IS CONFUSING OR IF ALL OF THAT IS CONFUSING HEARES TE EXPERIMENT THERE'S A MOUSE IN A CAGE AS A LITTLE WIRE COMING OUT OF ITS HEAD IT DOESN'T NOTICE BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE KNOW THIS CAUSE IT'S STILL EATING AND MATING AND DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT MICE LIKE TO DO ON DAILY BASIS AND SLEEPING ET CETERA AND THE MERE PRESSING OF A BUTTON WILL ACTIVATE A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT RELEASED AT THE END OF THAT WIRE THAT LIGHT ACTIVATES PARTICULAR NONS IN THIS CASE IT'S THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR CONTAINING HERONS IN ONLY THE VENTRIMEDIAE HYPOTHALMOS WHEN THAT MOUSE IS IN A CAGE WITH ANOTHER MOUSE A COUPLE OF THINGS HAPPEN DEPENDING ON WHAT THE OTHER MOUSE IS OR WE COULD SAY WHO THE OTHER MOUSEIS IF IT'S A MALE MOUSE AND YOU PUT IN THERE WITH A FEMALE MOUSE THE MALE MOUSE WILL ATTEMPT TO MATE WITH THE FEMALE MOUSE PROVIDED THAT THE MALE MOUSE AS GONE THROUGH PUBRITY HE WULL TRY TO MOUNT AND MATE WITH THE FEMALE MOUSE NOW FEMALE MICE ARE EITHER IN A RECEPTIVEPHASE OR A NON RECEPTIVE PHASE OF THEIR SO CALLED ESTRA CYCLE THEY DON'T HAVE A MENSTRAL TWENTY EIGHT DAY CYCLE THEY HAVE AN ESTRA CYCLE AND ON PARTICULAR DAYS OF THAT ESTRACYCLE THEY ARE NOT HAPPY TO MATE THEY WILL BASICALLY KEEP THEIR HIND QUARTERS AWAY FROM THE MALE MOUSE AT ALL COSSE THEY'LL EVEN ATTACK THE MALE MOUSE ON CERTAIN DAYS OF THE ESTRACYCLE HOWEVER THE FEMALE MOUSE WILL UNDERGO WHAT'S CALLED LORD DOSIS WHICH IS AN ARCHING OF HER BACK AND SHE'LL ALLOW THE MALE TO MOUNT AND MATE WITH HER SO A LARGE NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS WERE DONE BUT THE FIRST EXPERIMENT REALY WAS TO PUT THE MALE MOUSE AND WITH A FEMALE MOUSE WHOSE IN THE SO CALLED RECEPTIVE PHASE OF ESTRAS THAT IS SHE WILL ALLOW MATING AND HE STARTS MATING WITH HER AND THEY GO THROUGH THE STANDARD REPOTOIR OF MEATING BEHAVIORS THAT YOU OBSERVE IN MICE MOUNTING THRUSTING INTROMISSION AS IT'S CALLED IN THE MOUSE SEX WORLD I I GUSS I DO'T KN WHAT THE MICE CALL UP UT THAT'S WHAT THE EXPERIMENTORS CALL IT AND THEN AFTERWARDS THAT HE WILL DISMOUSE K SO THEY OBSERVE THIS KIND OF MOUNTING AND AND SEX BEHAVIOR IS VERY TYPICAL BUT ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE BEHAVIOR DIU TURNED ON THE LIGHT TO STIMULATE THESE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR CONTAINED HURONS ONLY IN THE MALE MOUSE AND WHAT SHE OBSERVED WAS INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC THE MALE MOUSE CEASES FROM TRING TO MATE WITH THE FEMALE MOUSE AND IMMEDIATELY TRIES TO KILL THE FEMALE MOUSE E STARTS ATTACKING HER THEN SHE TURNS OFF THE LIGHT THE MALE STOPS AND GOES BACK TO TRYN TO MATE WITH THE FEMALE MOUSE I'M SURE ALL THIS WAS VERY CONFUSING AND DISTURBING TO THE FEMALE MOUSE NONE THE LESS THAT WAS THE REPORTOIR THEY WOULD MATE TO STIMULATE THESE VENTRIMEDIAL HYPOTHALMUS NURONS THE MALE MOUSE WOULD IMMEDIATELY TRY AND ATTACK AND KILL THE FEMALE MOUSE AND THEN SHE WOULD STOP THE STIMULATION AND HE WOULD STOP TRYING TO ATTACK AND KILL THE FEMALE MOUSE RETURN TO THE ATTEMPT AT LEAST TO MATE WITH THE FEMALE MOUSE THESE ARE SUCH DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN BEHAVIOR TRIGGERED ONLY BY THE ACTIVATION OF ONLY THIS SMALL SET OF NURANS WITHIN THE VENTRAMEDIAL HYPOTHALMUS AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT THINK THAT YOU CAN WATCH THE SORT OF THING WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO TO OUTO A WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK A WHERE YOU CAN SEE AVIDIO OF THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IT'S INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC THE SHIFTING BEHAVIOR IS ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS CURS WITHIN SECONDS IF NOT MILLE ASSECONDS THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND THE NEXT EXPERIMENT THAT SHE DID WAS TO PUT A MALE MOUSE WITH THIS STIMULATION WITH LIKE CAPABILITY IN ITS VENTRAMEDIA HYPOTHALMUS INTO A CAGE ALONE BUT WITH A RUBBER GLOVE FILLED WITH AIR OR WATER MOUSE S WALKING AROUND SNIFFING PEING WHICH IS WHAT MALE MICE SEEM TO DO THEY SEEM TO EURINA EVERYWHERE ASSUCHALLY AN INTERESTING PERHAPS INTERESTING FEATURE OF MALE MICE AND ACHING MANY MALE ANIMALS PERHAPS EVEN HUMANS WE DON'T KNOW OR MAY WE DO KNOW BASILY A THIS BEEN OBSERVED TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN A EXPERIMENTS MAINLY BY LEASESTOWERS LAB AT THE SCRIPTS INSTITUTE AS CHARACTERIZE THIS F YOU PUT FEMALE MICE INTO AN ARENA OR CAGE THEY ALWAYS UR INATE IN A VERY SMALL CORNER OF THAT CAGE RES IF HE PUT MALE MICE INTO AN ARENA OR A CAGE THE URE INA EVERYWHERE THEY HAVE THIS KIM OF SESSION WITH SPRAYING THEIR EARN EVERYWHERE YOU CAN NUME SORT OF TRANSPOSE THAT TO HUMAN BEHAVIOR IF YOU LIKE IN ANY EVENT DA YOU PUT THE MOSE IN THE CAGE ALONE BUT WITH THIS RUBBER GLOVE THE MOUSE IS WALKING AROUND URNATING ET CETERA DOING WHATEVER IS THAT MYE DO THEN SHE STIMULATES THE ACTIVATION OF THESE VENTRAMEDIA HYPOTHALMUS NURONS AND THE MOUSE IMMEDIATELY TRIESE TO KILL THE GLOVE IT GOES INTO A RAGE ATTACKING THE GLOVE AS IF IT WERE ANOTHER MOUSE OR SOME OTHER ANIMATE OBJECT BUT OF COURSE IT'S AN INANIMATE OBJECT IS JUST A RUBBER GLOVE SHE STOPS THE STIMULATION AND THE MOUSE IMMEDIATELY GOES BACK TO BEING COMPLETELY CALM OR AT LEAST NOT ATTACKING AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOUSE WAS FEELING SO THESE ARE VERY DRAMATIC VIDIOS AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THEM BY FOLLOWING THE LINK THAT WILL PROVIDE IN THE CAPTION IF THAT SORT OF THING IS GOING TO DISTURB YOU BY A TO SEE FOR INSTANCE THE ATTACK A ONE MOUSE ATTACKING ANOTHER PLEASE JUST DON'T WATCH THEM I'M NOT INTERESTING OF TROMATIZING ANYBODY OR YOU TROMATIZING YOURSELF THAT IS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS WERE DONE ON THIS EXPERIMENT FOR INSTANCE STIMULATING THE VEMATE IN FEMALE MICE AS OPPOSED A MALE MICE PUTTING THE FEMALE MICE IN WITH OTHER FEMALE MICE OR WITH OTHER MALE MICE NO MATTER WHAT VARIATION ONE CARRIES OUT SO DOES IT MATTER FITS MALE WITH FEMALE MALE WITH MALE FEMALE WITH FEMALE ET CETERA STIMULATION OF THE VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALMUS IN A MALE MOUSE OR FEMALE MOUSE EVOKES THIS VERY DRAMATIC ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR PHYSICALLY AGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR SUBSEQUENT EXPERIMENTS DONE BY DAULIN AN HER OWN LABORATORY AND OTHER LABORATORIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE VENTRAMEDIA HYPOTHALMUS IS CONNECTED WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER BRANARY S THAT ARE INTERESTING AND I'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE IN A LITTLE BIT BUT ONE OF THEM THAT I WANT TO CALL OUT NOW IS THE SO CALL P A G THE PERIACUODOCTAL GRAY NUCLEUS THIS IS A LARGE STRUCTURE IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN THAT HOUSES THINGS LIKE NURANS THAT CAN CREATE OPIOITS WE ALL KNOW OF THE OPIOI CRISIS BITH THESE AR NURONS THAT CAN PRODUCE IN DOGINIS MENS MADE BY THE BODY CHEMICALS THAT CAN CAUSE PAIN RELIEF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND WHY THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN A CIRCUIT FOR AGGRESSION MIGHT EVEN IF ONE IS THE AGGRESSOR IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY MAY INCUR SOME PHYSICAL DAMAGE AND THEY D WANT SOME PAIN RELIEF THE P A G ALSO IS CONNECTED TO A NUMBER OF NERL CIRCUITS THAT EVENTUALLY THROUGH SEVERAL PROCESSING STAGIENS STATIONS SCUSE ME ARRIVE AT THINGS LIKE THE JAWS AND IN FACT STIMULATION OF THE VENTRMEN O HYPOTHAMUS CAN EVOKE BITING AND AGGRESSIVE BITING BEHAVIOR NOW AGGRESSIVE BITING BEHAVIOR IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE INHUMANS IN A SPECIALLIN HUMAN CHILDREN BITING IS SOMETHING THAT WHILE YOUNG CHILDREN MIGHT DO AS A FORM OF AGGRESION TENDS TO DISAPPEAR PRETTY EARLY IN CHILDHOOD AND IF IT DOESN'T IT'S OFTEN SEEN AS A MARK OF PATHOLOGY I HAVE A STORY ABOUT THIS ASHE WHEN I WAS A KID I WENT TO A SUMMER SPORTS CAMP AND I I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS OF WE ARE PLAYING SOCKER AND AM IN IT IN A RARE STROKE OF LUCK OR ACCIDENT I HAPPENE A SCORE GOAL I WASN'T A PATICULARLY GOOD SOCRAPLAYER SPUCHLY NOT AT THAT STAGE IF MY LIFE THEY LATER FIGURED OUT THAT IT WAS JUST BETTER TO MAKE ME A FULL BACK CAUSE I COULD DISWAIT THERE AND DO WHAT FULL BACKS DO AS BETTER AT TAKING THE BALL OR THE PERSON OUT THAN I WAS PUTTING THE BALL IN AM THE GOAL NONE THE LESS I AGAIN BY CHANCE  I SCORTIGAL AND I WAS TROTTING BACK TO MY SIDE OF THE FIELD AND ALL A SUDDEN I FELT THE STING IN MY BACK A KID NOT TO BE NAMED THOUGH DO REMEMBER YOUR NAME I'LL NOT CN TELL YOU HIS NAME WAS A KID JUMPED ON MY BACK AND BIT ME ON THE TOP OF MY BACK AND UM THIS OF COURSE RESULTED IN A DISCUSSION AN A A TIME OUT AND ALL THE USUAL THINGS AND PARENTS I THINK OD INVOLVED I DON'T RECALL INTHING MUCH ELSE OF IT BUT I RECALL THAT THIS WAS CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY TROUBLING BEHAVIOR BECAUSE HE BIT ME AS OPPOSED TO HIT ME OR SHOVED ME DOWN OR SOMETHING THAT SORT AND IT DOES SEEM AS IF THE TENDENCY TO USE BITING AS AN AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR IS ASSOCIATED WITH A MORE PRIMITIVE CIRCUITRY NOW HERE I'M TRULY ENTHROPROMORPHISI I DO'T KNW WITH THIS OTHER KID HAPPEN TO BE THINKING OR FEELING AT THE TIME HOW COULD I AND I CERTAINLY AM NOT GOING TO SAY THAT BITING IN EVERY CASE REFLECTS A PATHOLOGY ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT IN THE PSYCHOLOGY COMMUNITY IN THE PSYCHATRIC COMMUNITY THAT PASS A CERTAIN AGE THE USING OF ONE'S TEETH TO IMPART AGGRESS AGGRESSION AND DAMAGE ON OTHERS IS AT PARTICULARLY PRIMITIVE AND TROUBLING ORELEAST FOR THE OBSERVER THE PERSON EXPERIENCES AF PRETTY DISTURBING EVENT DAU'S LAB HAS SHOWN N THAT ACTIVATION OF THE VENTROMEDIO HYPOTHALMUS TRIGGERS A DOWN STREAM CIRCUIT IN THE PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY WHICH THEN TRIGGERS A WHOLE OTHER SET OF CIRCUITS OF FIXED ACTION PATTERNS HERE WE ARE BACK TOLARENS AGAINS WITH FIXED ACTION PATTERNS INCLUDING SWINGING OF THE LIMBS RIGHT PUNCHING THIS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE CONTROLLED PUNCHING BUT ALSO BITING BEHAVIOR SO IT'S REMARKABLE TO ME AT LEAST THAT WE HAVE CIRCUITS IN OUR BRAIN THAT CAN EVOKE VIOLENT USE OF THINGS LIKE OUR MOUTH OR VIOLENT USE OF THINGS LIKE OUR LIMBS THAT OF COURSE COULD BE USED FOR THINGS LIKE SINGING OR KISSING OR EATING OR YOU DON'T GESTICULATING IN ANY KIND OF POLITE OR IN POLITE WAY THE POINT HERE IS THAT NEURAL CIRCUITS NOT INDIVIDUAL BRAIN AREAS EVOKE THE CONSTELLATION OF BEHAVIORS THAT WE CALL AGGRESSION NOW MANY OF VIEU ARE PROBABLY PUZZLED OR AT LEAST SHOULD BE BECAUSE IVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS HIGHLY SPECIALIZED BRAIN AREA THE VENTRAMEDIO HYPOTHALEMIS AND THIS HIGHLY SPECIALIZE SUBCATEGORY OF NURONS IN THE VENTRIMEDIO HYPOTHALMIS THESE NARNS THAT MAKE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR AND YET THE ACTIVATION OF THOSE CELLS TRIGGERS DRAMMATIC AND IMMEDIATE AGGRESSION BOTH IN MALES AND IN FEMALES AND BOTH AGAINST MALES AND AGAINST FEMALES WHAT'S GOING ON HERE MOST OF US THINK ABOUT ESTROGEN AND WE DON'T IMMEDIATELY THINK OF AGGRESSION MOST OF US HERE TESTOSTRONE AND WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT AGGRESSION ALTHOUGH OTHER THINGS AS WELL IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS I JUS ONE O BRIEFLY REFER BACK TO A CONVERSATION THAT I HAD ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE OF THE HUBRON LAPODCAST AND THAT WAS WITH MINT COLLEAGUE THE GREAT ROBERTS SOPOLSKI OF COURSE IS AF PROFESSOR STAMPHRO DU STUDIED TESTOSTERONE AND ITS IMPACTS ON BEHAVIOR AS WELL AS ESTROGEN AND OTHER HORMONES AN THEIR IMPACTS ON BEHAVIOR TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT AND TO DISPEL A STILL UNFORTUNATELY VERY COMMON MYTH TESTOSTRONE DOES NOT INCREASE AGGRESSIVENESS TESTOSTERONE INCREASES PROACTIVITY AND THE WILLINGNESS TO LEAN INTO EFFORT INCOMPETITIVE SENAREOS SOMETIMES THIS IS REFERRED TO US THAT CHALLENGE HYPOTHESIS BUT TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT IF PEOPLE ARE GIVEN TESTOSTERONE OR IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT LEVER LEVELS SCUSE ME OF TESTOSTRONE INDOGENOUSLY THAT THEY NATURALLY MAKE WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT TESTOSTRONE TENDS TO INCREASE COMPETITIVENESS BUT NOCOUST IN AGGRESSIVE SENAREOS SO IF SOMEBODY IS ALREADY AGGRESSIVE GIVING THEM TESTOSTRONE WILL HAVE THE TENDENCY TO MAKE THEM MORE AGGRESSIVE IF SOMEBODY HOWEVER IS VERY BENEVOLENT AND ALTRUISTIC GIVING THEM TESTOSTRON WILL MAKE THEM MORE BENEVOLENT AND ALTRUISTIC IT LEAST UP TO A POINT NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE CERTAIN FORMS OF SYNTHETIC TESTOSTRONES THAT ARE KNOWN IN SPORT CIRCLES AND INOTHER CIRCLES TO INCREASE AGGRESSIVENESS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THOSE PARTICULAR FORMS OF SYNTHETIC TESTOSTR ON'S WORK BUT IN GENERAL MOST OF THE EXPERIMENTS THAT ARE REFRING TO HAVE NOT BEEN DONE USING THOSE THEYVE BEEN DONE USING THE LAT'S CALL THEM THE MORE TRADITIONAL BIOLOGICAL FORMS OF TESTOSTRONER THAT RESEMBLE BIOLOGICAL FORMS OF TESTOSTRNE IN FACT ROBERT SUPULSYO DESCRIBE TO REALLY INTERESTING EXPERIMENT IN WHICH IF YOU LOOK AT TESTOSTRONE LEVELS OR YOU ADMINISTER ADDITIONAL TESTOSTERONE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING PHILANTHROPY GIVING MONEY TO ORGANIZATIONS AND SO THER ARE SENTUALLY DOING GOOD BECAUSE THESE ARE ORGANIZATIONS DOING GOOD WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT INCREASE TESTOSTERONE OR FURTHER INCREASING TESTOSTERONE MAKES PEOPLE MORE WILLING TO COMPETE TO GIVE MORE MONEY THAN THE OTHER PERSON IN THE ROM IN ORDER A YOU KNOW T TO PUT IT IN ER QUOTES TO ALPHA OUT  THE OTHER PERSON BY GIVING MORE MONEY SO THIS IS AN ACT OF ALTROISTIC OR BENEVOLENT PHILANTHROPY IT IS NOT ACT OF AGGRESSION OF COURSE WE DON'T KOWHAT THE PEOPLE ARE FEELING UNDERNEATH ALL THAT AGAIN WE CAN'T ENTER PROMORIPHIES OR A PROJECTON TOTHER PEOPLE WAT THEIR FEELING BUT THE POINT IS THAT TESTOSTERNE ITSELF DOES NOT MAKE PEOPLE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND IN THE EXPERIMENT THAT WE'VE BEN TALKING OUT UP UNTIL NOW IT'S ACTALLY THE ACTIVATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR CONTAINING NURONS THAT MAKES THESE ANIMALS MORE AGGRESSIVE AND IT TURNS OUT THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT IN CERTAIN CONTECTS ESTROGEN CAN MAKE PEOPLE MORE AGGRESSIVE SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WELL WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT TESTOSTERONE CAN BE CONVERTED INTO ESTROGEN THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED A ROMATIZATION THEREIS AN ENZIN CALLED A ROMATASTES ANY TIME YOU HAVE WORD THAT ENDS IN A S E T LEAST IF FITS IN THE CONTEXT TO BIOLOGY IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS NOT ALWAYS BUT ALMOST ALWAYS AND ENZIN SO RTHE AROMATASTES ENZIN CONVERTS TESTSTERONE INTO ESTROGEN AND IT IS ACTUALLY TESTOSTERONE AROMATIZED CONVERTED INTO ESTROGEN AND THEN BINDING TO THESE ESTROGEN CONTAINING NURONS IN THE VENTROMEDIO HYPOTHALMAUS THAT TRIGGERS AGGRESSION I WHON REPEAT THAT IT IS NOT TESTOSTRONE ITSELF THAT TRIGGERS AGGRESSION IT IS TESTOSTERONE A ROMATIZED INTO ESTROGEN WITHIN THE BRAIN AND BINDING TO THESE ESTROGEN RECEPTER CONTAINING NRONS IN THE VENTROMEDIO HYPOTHALMAS THAT EVOKES AGGRESSION AND DRAMATIC AGGRESSION AT THAT NOW THIS EFFECT OF ESTROGEN CAUSING AGGRESSION IN THE BRAIN IS VERY ROBOST SO MUCH SO THAT IF YOU TAKE A MAUCE THAT LACKS THE AROMATESES ENZIN OR A HUMAN THAT LACKS THE ARROMATASE ENZIN AND THEY DO EXIST THEN THERE IS A REDUCTION IN OVER ALL AGGRESSION DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE AND IF PEOPLE WHO OR MICE WHO HAVE THE ARROMATASES ENZIN HAVE THAT ENZIM BLOCKED WELL THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU INCREASE TESTOSTERON OR ANY OF ITS OTHER DIRIVITIVES YOU DO NOT OBSERVE THIS AGGRESSION SO THIS RUNS COUNTER TO EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW AND THINK ABOUT THE ROLE OF TESTOSTERON AGAIN TESTOSTERONE INCREASES COMPETITIVENESS IT CAN INCREASE THE DESIRE TO WORK UNDER CHALLENGE I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I RAN THESS OR PRESSUR TESTED THIS OF AGAINST ROBERT SOPOLSKI WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON TESTOTERON AND ITS ROLL IN THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR FOR MANY DECATES NOW IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT TESTASTERON HAS THE NET EFFECT OF MAKING EFFORT FEEL GOOD OR AT LEAST INCREASING THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH EFFORT FEELS BAD OR UNSUSTAINABLE AND IT DOES THAT BY WAY OF CHANGING THE ACTIVITY OR THE THRESHOLD FOR ACTIVATION OF BRAIN STRUCTURES LIKE THE IMIGDULA AND OTHER BRAIN STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY SO THE NEXTTIME SOMEBODY SAYS TESTOSTRONE MAKES PEOPLE AGGRESSIVE YOU CAN SAY AH NO ACTUALLY ITS ESTROGEN THAT MAKES PEOPLE AGGRESSIVE AND ANIMALS AGGRESSIVE FOR THAT MATTER NOW OF COURSE IT IS THE CASE THAT BECAUSE MALES HAVE RELATIVELY LESS ESTROGEN CIRCULATING IN THEIR BRAIN AND BODY THAN FEMALES RIHT BECAUSE THEY TESTIES NOT OVERIES THAT TESTAOSTRON IS REQUIRED IN THE FIRST PLACE IN ORDER TO BE CONVERTED INTO ESTROGEN TO ACTIVATE THIS AGGRESSIVE CIRCUIT INVOLVING THESE ESTEROGEN RECEPTR CONTAINING NEURONS IN THE VENTRIMEDIOHYPOTHALEMIS BUT NONE THE LESS IT IS ESTROGEN THAT IS THE FINAL STEP IT IS THE HORMONE ON WHICH AGGRESSIEN HINGES AND I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT'S A QUITE SURPRISING FINDING AND YET THIS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MORE ROBUST FINDINGS IN BOTH THE ANIMAL AND HUMAN LITERATURE AS IT RELATES TO HORMONES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES AND BEHAVIOR NOW OF COURSE IT IS THE CASE THAT IF TESTAOSTERONE IS LOW THAT A PERSEN OR AN ANIMAL WILL EXHIBIT LESS AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR BUT THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF REDUCED TESTOSTERON PERSEY IT'S BECAUSE OF THE SUBSEQUENT REDUCTION IN TESTOSTRON MEANING IF THERE'S NO TESTOSTRON TO ROMATIZE INTO ESTROGEN ESTEROGEN WILL ALSO BE LOWER SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT IT'S NOT TESTOSTERONE BUT TESTOSTRONE CONVERTED INTO ESTROGEN THAT ACTIVATES THESE CIRCUITS FOR AGGRESSION BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S STILL SURPRISING RIGHT I MEAN MOST OF US DON'T THINK ABOUT AT ESTROGEN AS THE HORMON THAT STIMULATES AGGRESSION BIT TURNS OUT IT'S ALL CONTEXTUAL THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL DATA SHOWING THAT WEATHER R NOT ESTROGEN STIMULATES AGGRESSION CAN BE POWERFULLY MODULATED BY WEATHER OR NOT DAYS ARE SHORT OR DAYS ARE LONG IN OTHER WORDS WETHER OR NOT THERE'S A LOT OF SUNSHINE OR NOT NOW OBVIOUSLY BRAIN IS IN CASED IN SKULL SO IT DOESN'T REALLY KNOW IF THERE'S A LOT OF SUNSHINE OUT THERE EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN SEE THE SUN WITH YOUR EYES YOU CAN FEEL IT ON YOUR SKIN DAYLENGTH IS CONVERTED INTO HORMONAL SIGNALS AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS AND THE PRIMARY HORMONOAN CHEMICAL SIGNALS INVOLVE MELATONAN AND DOPOMIN AND ALSO THE STRESHORMONS TO TO MAKE A VERY LONG STORY SHORT IN THE LONG DAYS WHERE WE GET A LOT OF SUNLIGHT BOTH IN OUR EYES AND ON OUR SKIN MELATONAN LEVELS ARE REDUCED MELATONE IS A HORMONE THAT TENDS TO ODUCE STATES OF SLEEPINESS AND QUIESCENCE IT ALSO TENDS TO ACTUVATE PATHWAYS THAT TEND TO REDUCE A THINGS LIKE BREEDING AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN LONG DAYS DOPOMING IS INCREASED DOPOMING IS A MOLECULE ASSOCIATE WITH FEELINGS OF WELL BEING AND MOTIVATION AND THE DESIRE TO SEEK OUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS ALL SORTS OF MOTIVATED BEHAVIORS AND IN LONG DAYS PROVIDED WE'RE GETTING ENOUGH SUNLIGHT ON OUR SKIN AND TO OUR EYES THE STRESS HORMONES ESPECIALLY CORTISALL AND SOME OF THE OTHER STRESSHORMONS ARE REDUCED IN LEVELS IF ESTEROGEN LEVELS ARE INCREASED EXPERIMENTALLY UNDER LONG DAY CONDITIONS IT DOES NOT EVOKE AGGRESSION HOWEVER IN SHORT DAYS IF ESTROGEN IS INCREASED THERE IS A HEIGHTEN PREDISPOSITION FOR AGGRESSION AND THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT SHORT DAYS DUE TO THE BIOLOGY OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY IN SHORT DAYS THE MELATONE AND SIGNAL GOES UP THERE'S MORE MELETONE IN CIRCULATING FOR MORE OF EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE STRESSHORMONES ARE CIRCULATING MORE WHY SHORT DAYS TEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH WINTER IN WINTER WE ARE BOMBARDED WITH MORE BACTERIAN VIRUSES BECAUSE BACTERI ENVIRUSES ACTUALLY SURVIVE BETTER IN COLD THAN THEY DO IN HEAT IN FACT TIN MY LABORATORY WE WORK WITH A LOT OF IRISES AND BACTERIAN WHEN WE WANT TO KEEP THEM ALIVE WE PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER IF WE WANT TO KILL THEM IF WE WANT TO NOCULATE THEM WE PUT THEM UNDER U VI LIGHT LIKE YOU COUSEE FROM THE SUNLIGHT SO SHORTER DAYS ARE CONDUCIVE TO AGGRESSION NOT BECAUSE DAYS ARE SHORT PER SA BUT BECAUSE STRESSHORMON LEVELS ARE HIGHER AND BECAUSE DOPOMING LEVELS ARE LOWER NOW HERE'S WHERE ALL THIS STARTS CONVERGE ON A VERY CLEAR BIOLOGICAL PICTURE A VERY CLEAR PSYCHOLOGICAL PICTURE AND INDEED A VERY CLEAR SET OF TOOLS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT AND USE UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE CORTISALL IS HIGH WHERE THIS STRESS HORMON IS ELEVATED END UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE THE NEUROMOGULATOR CERATONAN IS REDUCED THERE IS A GREATER PROPENSITY FOR ESTROGEN TO TRIGGER AGGRESSION NOW AGAIN I KNOW IVE SAD IT BEFORE BUT FOR MALES WHO MAKE A LOT OF TESTASTERON RELATIVE TO ESTROGEN YOU HAVE TO SWOP IN YOUR MIND THIS IDEA THAT IF TESTOSTERON IS HIGH THAT MEANS THAT ESTROGEN IS LOW BECAUSE WHILE THAT CAN BE TRUE IN THE PERIPHERY IN THE BODY IF TESTOSTERONE IS HIGH THERE IS GOING TO BE SUMM A ROMACISATION THAT CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERON TO ESTROGEN SO ANYTIME YOU HERE THAT TESTOSTERON IS HIGH YOU SHOULD THINK TESTASTERON IS HIGH IN THE BODY IN PERHAPS ESTROGEN IS LOW IN THE BODY BUT THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ESTROGEN IN THE BRAIN AND THEREFORE INCREASE PROPENSITY FOR AGGRESSION IN FEMALES WHO GENERALLY MAKE LESS TESTOSTERON RELATIVE TO ESTROGEN THERE IS SUFFICIEN ESTROGEN ALREADY PRESENT TO TRIGGER AGGRESSION SO BOTH MALES AND FEMALES ARE PRIMED FOR AGGRESSION BUT THAT'S RIDING ONIC CONTEXT AND THAT CONTEXT OF WHETHER NOT YOU GET A TENDENCY FOR AGGRESSION OR NOT DEPENDS ON WHETHER NOT CORTISAL IS HIGH OR LOW AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT IF CORTISAL IS RELATIVELY HIGHER IN ANY INDIVIDUAL THERE'S GOING TO BE A TILT AND INCREASE IN THAT HYDRAULIC PRESSURE THAT LORENS TALKED ABOUT TOWARD AGGRESSION AND IF CERTONAN THE NERMODULATOR THERE IS ASSOCIATED WITH FEELINGS OF WELL BEING AND SOMETIMES EVEN OF SLIGHT PASSIVITY BUT CERTAINLY OF WELL BEING IF CERETONAN IS LOW THERE'S ALSO CANT BE A FURTHER SHIFT TOWARDS AN AGGRESSIVE TENDENCY SO IF WE RETURN TO LORENZES HYDRAULIC PRESSURE MODEL OF AGGRESSION AND OTHER INTERNAL STATES WE REALIZE THAT EXTERNAL STIMULE THINGS THAT WE HEAR THINGS THAT WE SEE FOR INSTANCE SOME ONE SAYING SOMETHING UPSETTING OR A SEEING SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T LIKE TO OTHERS OR TO US AS WELL AS OUR INTERNAL STATE OR SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS OF WELL BEING BUT ALSO OUR STRESS LEVEL OUR FEELINGS OF WHETHER NOT WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES AND ARE CONTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE ALL OF THAT IS CONVERGING ON THIS THING THAT WE CALL INTERNAL STATE AND CREATING THIS PRESSURE OF EITHER TO BE MORE AGRESSIVE OR LESS AGGRESSIVE AND NOW WE HAVE SOME MAJOR PLAYERS FEEDING INTO THAT FINAL PATHWAY THAT QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT WILL WE HIT THE OTHER PERSON WILL WE SAY THE THING THAT IS CONSIDERED AGGRESSIVE WILL WE NOT SAY IT IF SOMEBODY SAYS SOME THING OR DOES SOMETHING AGGRESSIVE TO US WILL WE RESPOND OR WILL WE BE SUBMISSIVE OR EVEN PASSIVE AGAIND THERE MANY THINGS FUNDLING IN TO THAT QUESTION AND DICTATING WHETHER NOT THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY ALL FIGHT BACK OR I'M GING ATTACK THEM EVEN UNPROVOKED OR IF THEY SAY THIS I'M GOING TO DO THAT OR NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO I'M NOT GOING TO RESPOND THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE VERY COMPLEX AND YET WE REALLY CAN BOIL THEM DOWN TO JUST A FEW COMMON ELEMENTS AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT THOSE ELEMENTS ARE WHETHER NOT CORTISAL LEVELS ARE RELATIVELY LOWER OR RELATIVELY HIGHER AGAIN RELATIVELY HIGHER IS GOING TO TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE MORE REACTIVE WHY BECAUSE REACTIVITY IS REALLY A FUNCTION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH A SORT OF LIKE A SEA SAW THAT OSCILLATES BETWEEN SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SISTEM WHICH TENDS TO PUT US INTO A STATE OF READINESS THROUGH THE RELEAS OFE A DRENALINE CORTISALL AND ADRENALINE WHEN THER CIRCULATING THE BRAIN EMBODY MAKE US MORE LIKELY TO MOVE AND TO REACT AND TO SPEAK IS ASHALY WHAT WILL INDUCE A KIND OF LOW LEVEL TREMOR WHICH IS AN ANTICIPATORY TREMOR TO BE ABLE TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY RIGHT A BODY IN MOTION IS MORE EASILY SET INTO FURTHER MOTION THAT IS AND THE NURMODULATOR CERATONAN IS A NERMODULATOR THAT IN GENERAL IS ASSOCIATED WITH FEELINGS OF WELL BEING IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE SO WHEN WE ARE WELL FED CERATONANTENDS TO BE RELEASED IN OUR BRAIN INBODY IN PARTICULAR WELLFED WITH CARBOHYDRATES THE PRECURSOR TO CERATONAN IS TRIP TOFAN AND INDEED THERE ARE NI SE STUDIES EXPLORING THE TYPES OF DIETS NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT CAN REDUCE AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR BOTH IN CHILDREN AND IN ADULTS AN TRIP DOFAN RICH DIETS OR SUPPLEMENTATION WITH TRIP TO PAN SO FOR TRIP TOPHAN RICH DIETS THINGS LIKE WHITE TURKEY MEAT BUT THEN THERRE ALSO A NUMBER OF CARBOHYDRATES YOU CAN LOOK UP ITS VERY EASY TO FIND FOODS THAT CONTAIN LOTS OF TRIP TOFAND THOSE FOODS CONTAIN THE PRECURSOR TO CERATONAN NOW IT ISN'T SIMPLY THE CASE THAT EATING MORE FOODS WITH TRIP TOPAN WILL TEND TO REDUCE YOUR AGGRESSION AS POSE IT COULD DO THAT OF YOU ATE A IT AN ABUNDANCE IT COULD MAKE YOUTIRED IN THE NER LESS LIKELY TO BE AGGRESSIVE I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT STRATEGY BUT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WHEN IT'S BEEN EXPLORED INCREASING LEVELS OF TRIP TOPAN EITHER BY SUPPLEMENTATION OR BY FOOD OR DRUGS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT INCREASE SERATONANS SO FOR INS ITS FLUOXITINE SOMETIMES CALLED PROSACORS ALOFT OR ANY NUMBER THE OTHER ESSESSARIZE TEND TO REDUCE AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR NOW NOT ALWAYS BUT IN GENERAL THAT'S THE CASE SIMILARLY BECAUSE ELEVATED CORTISAL TENDS TO SHIFT THE WHOLE SYSTEM AGAIN CREATE MORE OF A HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TOWARDS AGGRESSIVE STATES IF CORTISAL LEVELS ARE REDUCED WELL THEN THE TENDENCY FOR AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR IS REDUCED THIS IS SUPPORTED BY A NUMBER OF PURE REVIEWED STUDIES WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO SOME OF THOSE IN THE CAPTION SHOW NOTES WOR CAN RETURN TO THES A A BIT LATER IN THE CONTICTS OF SPECIFIC STUDIES THAT IVE LOOKED AT GENETIC VARIANCE IN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS THAT CAUSE THEM TO MAKE MORE OR LESS CERATONAN OR AT LEAST TO METABOLIZE CERATONE IN DIFFERENTLY THIS IS ALSO THE CASE PORE SO CALLED INTERMITTENT EXPLOSIVE DISORDER THAT CAN OFTEN BE ASSOCIATED WITH GEN VARIANCE THAT CONTROL HOW MUCH CERATONAN IS MADE OR HOW ITS METABOLIZED OR HOW MUCH CORTISALS MADE AND HOW MUCH IVS METABOLIZED IN THINKING ABOUT TOOLS THERE AR NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ONE COULD CONSIDER FIRST OF ALL THER RE NUMBER OF DECENT STUDIES EXPLORING HOW SUPPLEMENTATION WITH THE OMEGATHREE FATIACIDS WHICH ARE PRECURSORS OF SOME OF THE TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS INCLUDING CERATONAN THAT CAN MODULATE NOT DIRECTLY MEDIATE BUT MODULATE MOOD AND EMOTIONAL TONE SUPPLEMENTATION WITH THE OMEGATHREES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE IMPULSIVITY AND AGGRESSIVENESS IN CERTAIN CONTECTS IN THINGS LIKE EIGHTY EIGHT OR IN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A PREDISPOSITION FOR AGGRESSIVE TYPE BEHAVIOR OR AGGRESSIVE THINKING NOW THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE OMAGATHRE FATIACIDS OR GOING DIRECTLY TO THE VENTRAME YOHYPOTHALEMUS IN CHANGING THE ACTIVITY OF NURANS THERE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE CAUSING OR MODULATING AN OVERALL SHIFT IN MOOD THROUGH THE UMIAN SYSTEM THROUGH HORMON SYSTEMS THAT ARE CHANGING THE OVERALL TONE ARE THE PROPENSITY FOR IT NERONS AN THE VENTURAL MEDIOHYPOTALMUS TO BE ACTIVATED HOW MUCH OMEGATHREE FATIACID WHAT SOURCE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE PODCAS BEFORE YOU CAN OF COURSE GET OMEGATHREE FATIACIDS FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FOODS GETTING THEM FROM WHOLE FOODS AS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO DO IT BUT MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION WILL OFTEN SUPPLEMENT WITH ONE GRAMA OR MORE OF OMAGA THREE FADIACIDS PER DAY SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF WILL TAKE THEM EVERY DAY AS JUST A GENERAL MOOD AND HANCER I DON'T SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION BUT I'VE FOUND IT BE BENEFICIAL FOR MY HEALTH AND SO SOME PEOPLE DO THAT AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE HOW IN DOUBLE BLIND PLICIBA CONTROLLED STUDIES PEOPLE TAKING ONE TO THREE GRAMS OF OMAGATHREE FADIASIDS PERDAY TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF A HIGH QUALITY FICIOIL THOUGH THEIR OTHER SOURCES AS WELL ALGY AND SO FORTH CAN EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD THAT ARE ON PAR WITH SOME OF THE ECESSORISE TO SELECT A CERETONAM REUPTAKEN HIBITORS AND OF COURSE IF YOU ARE PRESCRIBED IN ECESSORIVE BY YOUR SECIATRIST OR OTHER DOCTOR PLEASE DO TAKE THAT AND DON'T CEASE TO TAKE IT JUST SIMPLY TO TAKE A MAGATHREES HOWEVER YOU MIGHT MENTION TO THEM AND YOU CAN FIND LINKS TO THE STUDIES IN OUR PREVIOUS EPISODES ON DEPRESSION THAT SUPPLEMENTATION WITH YO MAGA THREE FADIACIDS OF AT THIS ONE GRAHM OR MORE OF E P A SPECIFICALLY SO GETTING ABOVE THAT ONE GRAM THRESHOLD AS HIGHEST THREE GRAMS PER DAY OF THE E P A HAS ALLOWED PEOPLE TO TAKE LOWER DOSES OF ECESS ARISE AND STILL KEEP THEIR MOOD IN A PLACE THAT'S BENEFICIAL FOR THEM AND IN TERMS OF KEEPING CORTSALL IN ARRANGE THAT'S HEALTHY AND DOESN'T BYASOME ONE TOWARD HIGH LEVELS OF AGGRESSION AND IRRITABILITY THAT'S AGAIN GOING TO BE SET BY A NUMBER OF LARGER MODULATORS ORE CONTEXTURAL CUES AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ON THE POTCASSPITAL JUS BRIEFLY RECAPD THEM NOW OVISLY GETTING SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES EARLY IN THE DAY AND AS MUCH SUNLIGHT AS YOU SAFELY CAN IN YOUR EYES THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS EFFECT OF ESTEROGEN IN LONG DAYS NOT INCREASING AGGRESSION HOWEVER IN SHORTER DAYS ESTERGEN INCREASES IGRESSION BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING CARTESALL OBSERVED IN SHORT DAYS ANOTHER WAY TO REDUCE CORTISALL WAS DISCUSSED IN OUR EPISODE ON HEAT IN THE USE OF SANA AND HEAT BUT ALSO HOT BATHS IT TURNS OUT THAT HOT BATHS AND SANA CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCIN CORTISAL ALL THE DETAILS ON THAT AR INCLUDED IN THE EPISODE ON HEAT AND ITS TIME STAMP SO YOU CAN GO DIRECTLY TO THAT IF YOU ON TO LEARN ABOUT THE TEMPERATURES IN THE VARIOUS DURATIONS BUT TO UST GIVE A A SYNOPSIS OF THAT A TWENTY MINUTE SANA AT ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREES SELSIUS IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCIN CORTISALL YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A SANA YOU COULD DO A HOT BATH A JUST THE TEMPERATURE S YOU DON'T BURN YOURSELF I THINK YOU KNOW EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREE SELSIIS GOING TO BE TOO HOT FOR ANY PEOPLE OF ITS A HOT BATH AS MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T TOLERATE THAT HABAT CANTOLERATE THE SANAS O SAFETY FIRST ALWAYS AND OF COURSE BUT HOT BATHS REDUCE CORTESALL HOTSANAS REDUCE CORTESALL OF A DURATION ABOUT TWENTY A THIRTY MINUTES IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL AND OF COURSE SOME OF YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THE SUPPLEMENTATION ROUD AND FOR REDUCTIONS IN CORTISAL REALLY THE A CHIEF PLAYER THERE IS ASCHOWAGANDA WHICH IS KNOWN TO DECREASE CORTISAL FAIRLY POTENTLY I SHOULD JUST WARN YOU TH T IF YOUR GOING TO USE ASHUAGONDA IN ORDER TO REDUCE CORTISALL FIRST OF ALL CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR R HALTH CARE PROVIDER BEFORE ADDING OR SUBTRACTING ANYTHING FROM YOUR SUPPLEMENTATION OR HEALTH REGIMENT OF COURSE I DON'T YOU SAY THAT TO PROTECT US I SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTH WHAT YOU TAKE IN WHAT YOU DON'T TAKE CHRONIC SUPPLEMENTATION WITH ASHUAGONDA CAN HAVE SOME NOT SO GREAT EFFECTS OF DISRUPTION OF OTHER HORMON PATHWAYS AND NORO TRANSMITTER PATHWAYS SO THE LIMIT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT TWO WEEKS OF OF REGULAR USE BEFORE YOU' GOING TO TAKE A BREAK OF ABOUT TWO WEEKS SO ASHWAGONDA AGAIN A VERY POTENT INHIBITER OF CORTISALL BUT WITH SOME OTHER AFFECTS AS WELL DON'T USE IT CHRONICALLY FOR LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS BUT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE CORTISALL LET THAY YOURE GOING THROUGH A PERIOD OF INCREASE THE IRRITABILITY AND AGGRESSIVE TENDENCY MAY BE YOUR ALSO NOT GETTING AS MUCH LIGHT AS YOU WOULD LIKE AND PERHAPS ALSO IF THERE ARE OTHER AM CIRCUMSTANTIAL THINGS LEADING TOWARDS MORE GRESSIVENESS IN YOUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE AGGRESSIVENESS THAT CAN BE POTENTIALLY HELPFUL AND IN LIGHT OF ALL THE STUFF ABOUT CORTISALL AND ESTEROGEN AND DAYLENGTH SHOULD MENTION THAT THERE ARE IN FACT SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO BE MORE IRRITABLE AND AGGRESSIVE THERE COUPLE OF DIFFERENT GENE PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WE NEVER LIKE TO THINK ABOUT JUST ONE GENE CAUSING A SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR THE WAY TO THING ABOUT GENES IS THAT GENES GENERALLY CODE FOR THINGS WITHIN OUR BIOLOGY IN THE CONTEXTS OF TAYS DISCUSSION THINGS LIKE NORAL CIRCUITS OR THE AMOUNTS OF NAURO TRANSMITTERS THAT ARE MADE OR THE AMUNTS OF HORMONES THAT ARE MADE OR THE AMOUNT OF NERROW TRANSMITTER HORMON RECEPTERS OR ENZIMES AT CETERA THAT SHIFT THE ACTIVITY OF OUR BIOLOGY IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION THEY BIAS OUR BIOLOGY AND IN FACT THERE IS A GENETIC VARIANT PRESENT IN CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT A JUST THERE ESTROGEN RECEPTR SENSITIVITY AND THAT ESTEROGEN RECEPTOR SENSITIVITY CAN RESULT AND INCREASE LEVELS OF AGGRESSION SOMETIMES DRAMATIC INCREASES HOWEVER AND ALSO VERY INTERESTINGLY PHOTO PERIOD MEANING DAYLENGTH IS A STRONG MODULATOR OF WEATHER NOT THAT AGGRESSIVENESS TURNS UP OR NOT WEATHER OR NOT THAT PERSON WITH THE PARTICULAR GENE VARIANT IS MORE AGGRESSIVE OR NOT DEPENDSON HOW LONG THE DAY IS AND HOW LONG THE NIGHT IS ONE PARTICULAR STUDY THAT I LIKE THAT REFERENCE IS THIS IS TRAINER AT ALL THE TITLE F STUDY IS PHOTO PERIOD REVERSES THE EFFECTS OF ESTEROGENS ON MAL AGGRESSION BY A GENOMIC AND NONGENOMIC PATHWAYS THAS WAS A PAPER PUBLISH IN THE PROCEEINGS IN THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES WILL PUT A REFERENCE TO THIS IN THE SHONOTES IF YOU LIKE TO EXPLORE IT FURTHER BUT IT REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT RARELY SOMETIMES BUT RARELY IS IT THE CASE THAT JUST ONE GENE WILL CAUSE SOMEBODY TO BE HYPERAGGRESSIVE ALMOST ALWAYS THERE IS GOING TO BE AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN GENETICS AN ENVIRONMENT AND AS ENVIRONMENT CHANGES SUCH AS DAYLENGTH CHANGES AND THE LENGTH OF NIGHT CHANGES SO TOO WILL THE TENDENCY FOR PEOPLE WITH A IT GIVEN CINETIC VARIANT TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE OR NOT NOW OF COURSE IN THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED GENETIC TESTING FOR THIS PARTICULAR ESTERGEN RECEPTORE VARIANT MOST PEOPLE I'M GUESSING YOU ARE POLBLY NOT WALKING ROUND KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE THIS GENE OR NOT REGARDLESS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW YOU FEEL AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF YEAR DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT SUMMER WHETHER NOT IT'S WINTER WHETHER NOT YOUR GETTING SUFFICIENT SUNLIGHT MEANING VIEWING SUFFICIENT SUNLIGHT OR NOT WHETHER NOT YOUR GETTING SUFFICIENT SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR SKIN OR NOT WHETHER NOT YOUR INDOORS ALL THE TIME GENERALLY THOSE THINGS CORRELATE WITH SEASON BUT NOT ALWAYS YOU CAN GO THROUGH LONG BOUTS OF YOU HARD WORK IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN DAYS ARE LONG BUT YOU'R INDOORS A LOT AND GETTING A LOT OF FLORESCENT LIGHT EXPOSURE LATE IN THE EVENING AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHEN YOUR FEELING OR AGGRESSIVE SO WE HATE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT DRAWING A ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANY BIOLOGICAL FEATURE AND CERTAINLY PSYCHOLOGICAL OR BEHAVIOURAL FEATURE LIKE AGGRESSIVENESS BUT IT'S I BELIEVE HELPFUL TO KNOW THAT THESE GENETIC BIASES EXIST HOW THEY PLAY OUT AGAIN THEY SHIFT OUR BIOLOGY AND IN A GENERAL THEMATIC DIRECTION THEY DON'T CHANGE ONE THING THEY CHANGE OUR VARIETY OF THINGS THAT BIASUS TORED OR AWAY FROM CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL OUTCOMES AND THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN ORDER TO OFFSET THEM WE DESCRIBE THOSE EARLIER IN TERMS OF TRY TO KEEP CARTERS AL LOU BY GETTING SUFFICIENT SUNLIGHT REGARDLESS OF TIME OF YEAR AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE THIS PARTICULAR GENETIC VARIANT SO EARLI ER I TALKED ABOUT HOW IT IS TESTOSTERONE CONVERTED INTO ESTEROGEN THAT'S ACTIVATING AGGRESSION IN THE VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALMIS NOT TESTSTRNE ITSELF HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME STUDIES CARRIED OUT IN HUMANS THAT IF A VALUATED THE EFFECTS OF TESTOSTRONE AND HOW LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE CORRELATE WITH AGGRESSIVENESS IN THE SHORT TERM JUST GOING TO DETAIL A FEW OF THOSE STUDIES BECAUS I THINK THEY ARE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A STUDY THAT IS EXPLORED LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE IN MEN OF DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS NOW BEFORE I TELL YOU THE DATA I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR HERE WITH A STUDY SUCH AS THIS ONE NEVER KNOWS WHETHER NOT THESE MEN WHENT INTO A PARTICULAR PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY HAD A TESTOSTRONE LEVEL OF A GIVEN VALUE OR WHETHER R NOT THE WORK ITSELF ALTERED THEIR TESTOSTRONE LEVELS OR BOTH AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO ASSUME THAT IT'S PROBABLY BOTH SO BE VERY CAREFUL IN ASSUMING THAT A GIVEN TESTOSTRONE LEVEL IS CAUSAL FOR CHOOSING A PARTICULAR CAREER OR THAT A PARTICULAR CAREER IS CAUSAL FOR CREATING A PARTICULAR TESTOSTRONE LEVEL THE STUDY USED SALAVARY TESTOSTRONE LEVELS AS THE MEASURE WHICH TO BE FAIR IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE TESTOSTRONE TYPICALLY BLOOD DRAW WOULD BE THE BESTWAY TO MEASURE TESTOSTROMEBOR NONE THE LESS PROVIDED THE APPROPRIATE METHODS ARE USED SALAVARY TESTOSTRONE CAN BE A REASONABLE MEASURE OF TESTOSTRONE THE DIFFERENT OCCUPA SIONS THAT WERE LOOKED AT WERE AND HERE THEY JUST LOOKED AT MEN IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WERE MINISTERS SALESMEN THEY DIDN'T SAY WHAT PARTICULAR TYPES OF SALESMENT FIREMEN PROFESSORS OF ALL THINGS PHYSICIONS AND ANIFEL PLAYERS AND WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WAS THAT THE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS WERE ESSENTIALLY IN THAT ORDER FROM LOW TO HIGHEST SO MINISTER SALESMEN FIREMEN PROFESSOR PHYSICION ANIFEL PLAYER NOW WE COULD MICRODISECT ALL THE DIFFERENT STEREOTYPES AND ALL THE DIFFERENT FEATURES OF EACH OF THESE JOBS FOR INSTANCE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE FACT THAT THE FIREMEN HAPPENED AT LEAST IN THIS STUDY TO HAVE LOWER TESTOSTRONE LEVELS ON AVERAGE THAN THE PROFESSORS OR THE PHYSICIONS WAS BECASFIREMEN HAVE LOWER TESTOSTERONE LEVELS OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MUCH MORE STRESSFUL JOB IN THE CARTISAL LEVELS AR HIGHER THEN THE PROFESSOR OF THE PHYSICION AND CORTISAL AND TESTOSTRONE NOT ALWAYS BUT GENERALLY ARE IN SOMEWHAT AN TAGONISTIC PUSHPOLL A MODE BECAUSE THEY DERIVE FROM THE SAME PRECURSER ET CETERA TIPICALLY WHEN WHEN CORTISAL IS HIGE TESTOSTRONTENTS BE LOWER AND VICE VERSA  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THESE EFFECTS AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE STUDY AND JUST SIX OCCUPATIONS BUT I THINK IT'S RELATIVELY INTERESTING GIVEN THE FACT THAT EACH OF THESE PROFESSIONS INVOLVES DIFFERENT LEVELS OF COMPETITIVENESS RIGHT SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY JUST WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE LEVEL OF PHYSICAL EXERTION THAT'S REQUIRED BUT ALSO LEVEL OF COMPETITIVENESS BECAUSE IT'S KNOWN THAT COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS CAN CAUSE INCREASES IN TESTOSTERONE IN PARTICULAR IN THE WINNERS OF COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS A TOPIC FOR A FUTURE PODCAST MEANWHILE STUDIES THAT HAVE ANALYZED ALSO AGAIN SALAVARY TESTOSTERONE IN PRISONERS IN THIS CASE FEMALE PRISONERS SO THESE ARE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS HAVE LOOKED AT LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE ACCORDING TO WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON COMMITTED A NON VIOLENT OR OF VIOLENT CRIME IN ORDER TO ARRIVE IN PRISON AND HIGHER LEVELS OF SALEVARY TESTOSTRONE WERE RELATED TO THOSE THAT HAD ARRIVED IN PRISON BECAUSE OF CONVICTION OF A VIOLENT CRIME AS A POST OF NONVIOLENT CRIME LIKEWISE WHEN THEY ANALYZED PRISON RULE VIOLATIONS SO AN INDIRECT MEASURE OF AGGRESSIVENESS BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS STRONGLY ASSOCIATE WITH THA GRESSIVENESS BECAUSE THEY KNEW IT THE VIOLATIONS WERE THEY FOUND WERE FOR PRISONERS THAT HAD NONE NO PRISON VIOLATIONS PRISON RULE VIOLATIONS AS TO SAY THEIR TESTOSTRONE LEVELS TENDED TO BE LOWER THAN THE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS OF WOMEN THAT HAD SOME EVEN ONE WERE MORE AGGRESSIVE VIOLATIONS OF PRISON RULES WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO THESE A STUDIES IN THE SHOWNOTES IF YOU LIKE TO GO INTO THEM FURTHER OBVIOUSLY STUDIES LIKE THIS NEED TO BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BECAUSE THERE SO MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS DIFFERENT PRISONS HAVE DIFFERENT A DEGREES OF A OUNAL VIOLENCE TO BEGIN WITH AND COMPETITIVS TO BEGIN WITH BUT JUST AS A FINAL PASS AT EXAMINING THE ROLL BETWEEN TESTOSTRON AND AGGRESSIVENESS THER WAS A VERY INTERESTING STUDY FROM GOTS AT ALL G O E T Z PUBLISHIN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEM THAT LOOKED AT SIRUM SO IN THIS CASE BLOOD LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE THIRTY MINUTES AFTER APPLICATION OF A GEL BASE TESTASTRO ON THE GHOS TRANS TERMALSO THAT THE TESTOSTR CAN GO VERY QUICKLY INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND THEN DID BRAIN IMAGING TO EVALUAIGT THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS IN THE SO CALL CORTICA MEDIAL A MIGDULA THE CORTOMI THE MEDIALAMIGDULA IS ONE OF THE AREAS OF THE IMIGDULA COMPLEX AS WE CALL IT BECAUSE ITS COMPLEX HAS GOT ALOUTA DIFFERENT NUCLII YOU KNOW KNOW WHAT NUCLII ARE LOL CLUSTERS OF NERONS HAS GOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT ONES BUT THAT MEDIAL AND THAT CORTICOMEDIO MIGDULA IN PARTICULAR IS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AGGRESSIVE TYPE BEHAVIORS ITS LINKED UP WITH IS PART OF THE LARGER CIRCUIT THAT INCLUDES THE VENTROMEDIO HYPOTHALEMUS ANOTHER BRAINARIAS THAT WE REFER TO EARLIER SUCH IS THE P A G WHAT WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS STUDYES THAT SHOWED THAT JUST THIRTY MINUTES AFTER APPLICATION OF THIS SO CALLED ANDRGEL THIS TESTOSTRON THAT SEEPS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OF COURSE TESTOSTRON AND CORTICORTICOMEDIAL A MIGDULA ACTIVATION SO TESTOSTRON CAN HAVE ACUTE EFFECTS IMMEDIATE EFFECTS ON THE PATHWAYS RELATED TO AGGRESSION ND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED BECAUSE MANY OF THE EFFECTS OF STERID HARMONES LIKE TESTOSTRON ESTRAN ARE VERY SLOW ACTING IN FACT STORID HORMONES BECAUSE THEY HAVE OF CERTAIN BIL CHEMICAL COMPOSITION CAN ACTUALLY PASS THROUGH THE MEMBRANES OF CELLS SO THE OUTSIDE OF A CELL AND INTO THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELL AND CHANGE GENE EXPRESSION IN THE CELL THINK ABOUT PUBERITY THAT GIVE THAT GOES HOME FOR THE SUMMER THAN COMES BACK LOOKING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WELL THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF GENES GOT TURNED ON BY STEROID HORMONES LIKE TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN BUT THE STORID HORMONS CAN ALSO HAVE VERY FAST ACTING EFFECTS AND WIT TESTOSTRON IN PARTICULAR THOSE CAN BE REMARKABLY FAST ACTING AND ONE OF THE MOST APPARENT AND WELL DOCUMENTED FAST ACTING EFFECTS IS THIS EFFECT THE ABILITY TO ACTIVATE CELLS WITHIN THE EMIGDULA S YE MIGHT SAY WELL I THOUGT THE IMIGDULA WAS ASSOCIATE WITH FEAR WOULDN'T TESTOSTRON THAN CAUSE FEAR NO TURNS OUT THAT THE IMMIGDULA HARBORS BOTH CORTIZAL CORTICO STERON RECEPTORS AND TESTOSTRON RECEPTORS AND TAY EACH A JUST ACTIVITY IN THE IMIGDULA DIFFERENTLY SUCH THAT TESTOSTRON TENDS TO ACTIVATE A MIGDULA CIRCUITRY FOR INDUCING STATES OF MIND AND BODY THAT ARE MORE ACTION BASE AND INDEED IN ANIMALS AND INHUMANS TESTOSTRON APPLICATION AND ACTIVATION OF THIS CORTICOMEDIAL MIGDULA PATHWAY WILL MAKE ANIMALS AN HUMANS LEAN INTO EFFORT THIS IS WHYSAY TESTOSTRON MAKES EFFORT FEEL GOODOR AT LEAST BIASES THE ORGANISM TOWARD LEANING INTO CHALLENGE SO IF YOU RECALL THERE'S NOT JUST ONE TYPE OF AGGRESSION THERE'S REACT OFE AGGRESSION WHICH IS TRIGGERED WHEN ONE IS CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING THAT SOMETIMES IS INEVITABLE RIGHT ONE NEEDS TO FIGHT FOR THEI LIFE OR FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE BUT ALSO PROACT OF AGGRESSION AND PROACTOFE AGGRESSION INVOLVES ACTIVATION OF THOSE GO PATHWAYS IN THE BASIL GANGLIA AND A LEANING INTO EFFORT TO OVERCOME WHATEVER STATE ON HAPPENS TO BE IN TO BEGIN WITH AND SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT YES ESTROGEN IS ACTIVATING AGGRESSION PATHWAYS THAT ARE IN THE VENTRAMA YOHYPOTHALMUS BUT ITS VERY LIKELY THE CASE THAT TESTASTRONE IS ACTING TO ACCELERATE OR TO BIAS STATES OF MIND IN BODY TOARD THOSE THAT WILL LEAD TO AGGRESSION AGAIN AGGRESSION IS NOT LIKE A SWITCH ON AND OFF ITS A PROCESS IT HAS A BEGINNING AMIDDLE AND AN END REMEMBER THAT HYDRALIC PRESSURE THAT CONRAD LARENDS HYPOTHESIZED WELL THINK OF TESTOSTERONE AS INCREASING THE PRESSURE TOARD AN AGGRESSIVE EPISODE AND THEN ESTEROGEN ACTUALLY TRIGGERING THAT AGGRESSIVE EPISODE IN THE VENTRIMEDIAL HYPOTHALEMUS SO IF SOMEBODY TELLS YOU THAT TESTASTERONE INDOGENOUS OR EXOGENOUS MAKES PEOPLE AGGRESSIVE TELL THEM NO TESTOSTERONE TENDS TO MAKE PEOPLE LEAN INTO EFFORT AND IF THAT EFFORT INVOLVES BEING AGGRESSIVE EITHER REACTIVE LEAGGRESSIVE OR PROACTIVELY AGGRESSIVE WELL THEN IT WILL INDEED LEAD TO AGGRESSION BUT THE ACTUAL AGGRESSION ITSELF IS TRIGGERED BY ESTROGEN NOT TESTOSTERO NOW THUS FAR WE REALLY HAVEN'T TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SOCIAL CONTECT IN WHICH AGGRESSION OCCURS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS A NEAR INFINITE IF NOT INFINITE NUMBER A VARIABLES THAT WILL DETERMINE THAT SO FOR INSTANCE VIOLENT AGGRESSION IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE AT A PROFESSIONAL BOXING MATCH PROVIDED ITS OCCURRING INSIDE THE RING AND ONLY BETWEEN THE COMPETITORS AND WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE RULES OF THE SPORT ET CETERA HOWEVER THERE OR SOME THINGS THAT TEND TO BIAS CERTAIN SOCIAL CONTECTS TOWARD BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE OR LESS AGGRESSIVE AND NOT ALWAYS PHYSICAL AGGRESSION AND THOSE GENERALLY COME IN TWO FORMS THAT MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHICH ARE ALCOHOL AND CAFFINE THUS DISCUSS CAFFIN FIRST WY WOULD KAFFIN INCREASE AGGRESSIVE IMPULSIVITY WELL THE GENERAL FACTS OF CAFFINE ARE TO INCREASE AUTONOMIC ARROUSAL THE ACTIVITY OF THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS TO PUT IT VERY MUCH IN PLAIN LANGUAGE IT'S THE ALERTNESS ARM OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT IS IT CREATES A SENSE OF READINESS IN YOUR BRAIN IN BODY AND IT DOES SO BY ACTIVATING THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC CHAIN GANGLIA AGAIN AS I ALWAYS REMIND PEOPLE SYMPA AND SYMPATHETIC DOES NOT MEAN SYMPATHY SYMPA MEANS TO GETHER OR ALL AT ONCE AND CAFFIN TENDS TO BIAS ARE BRAIN IN BODY TO ACTIVA THE SYMPATHETIC CHANGANGLE WHICH RUN FROM ABOUT THE BASE OF YOUR NECK UNTO THE PTOPIAR PELVUS AND DEPLOY A BUNCH OF CHEMICALS THAT JUT OUT INTO THE RESTOUR BODY ACTIVATEA DRENALINE RELEASE THERE'S A PARALLEL INCREASE IN A DR OF A DRENALIN IN YOUR BRAIN CREATING THE STATE OF ALERTNESS AND READINESS THAT STATE OF ALERTNESS AND READINESS CAN BE FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS NOT JUST AGGRESSION HOWEVER WHEN WE ARE IN A STATE OF INCREASE SYMPATHETIC TONE MEANING MORE ALERT SUCH AS AFTER DRINKING CAFFIN WE WILL BUY US ALL THOSE BRAIN ANDBODY SYSTEMS THAT HORMONS THE CHEMICALS ET CETERA THAT EXIST TOWARD ACTION IS OPPOSED TO INACTION SO PUT SIMPLY CAFFINE CAN INCREASE IMPULSIVITY NO SURPRISE THERE ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THINGS ALCOHOL TENDS TO DECREASE ACTIVITY IN THE SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NER SYSTEM TENDS TO MAKE US FEEL LESS ALERT NOW INITIALLY IT CAN CREATE A STATE OF ALERTNESS BECAUSE OF ITS AFFECTION INHIBITING THE FOREBRAIN OUR FOREBRAIN PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS IN PARTICULAR HAS WHAT'S CALLED TOP DOWN INABITION IT EXERTS A INHIBITORY OR A QUIETING EFFECT ON SOME OF THE CIRCUITS OF THE HYPOTHALMAS SUCH AS THE VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALMAS THE WAY TO CONCEPTIALIZE THIS IS THAT YOUR FOREBRAIN IS ABLE TO RATIONALIZE AND THINK CLEARLY AND TO SUPPRESS BEHAVIOR INTO ENGAGE THE NOGO PATHWAITS TELLING YOU DON'T SAY THAT MEAN THING DON'T DO THAT VIOLENT THING ET CETERA ALCOHOL INITIALLY TENDS TO INCREASE OUR LEVEL OF OVERALL ACTIVITY BY REDUCING INABITION NOTCIOUS IN THAT FOREBRAIN CIRCUIT BUT IN OTHER CIRCUITS TENDS TO MAKE US MORE ACTIVE WE TEND TO TALK MORE THAN WE NORMALLY WOULD MOVE MORE THAN WE NORMALLY WOULD BUT VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER STARTS ACTING AS A SEDITIVE BY WAY OF REDUCING ACTIVITY IN THE FOREBRAIN RELEASING SOME OF THE DEEPER BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN YIMPULSIVITY BUT ALSO CAUSING A SOMEWHAT SETIVE OF EFFECT AND THEN OF COURSE AS ALCALL LEVELS INCREASE EVEN FURTHER PEOPLE EVENTUALLY WILL PASS OUT BLACKOUT ET CETERA SO WHAT WE'VE GOT WITH ALCOL IN CAFFIN AS WE GET TWO OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM CAFFINE INCREASING AROUSAL AND READINESS AND THE TENDENCY FOR IMPULSIVITY AN ALCOHOL ALSO INCREASING IMPULSIVITY BUT THROUGH A DIFFERENT MECHANISM A REALLY INTERESTING STUDY AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION THAT THE TITLE OF THE STUDY IS CALFINATED AND NON CAFFINAED ALCOHOL USE AND INDIRECT AGGRESSION THE IMPACT OF SELF REGULATION SO THE TITLEIS ALMOST SELF EXPLANATORY SOS A PAPER PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL VEDICTIVE BEHAVIOR IN TWENTY SIXTEEN EXAMINING HOW INGESTION OF ALCOHOL THAT'S EITHER CALFINATED OR NON CAFFINATED ALCOHOL DRINKS IMPACTED WHAT THEY CALL INDIRECT AGGRESSION AND JUST TO REMIND YOU WHAT INDIRECT DIGRESSION IS THESE ARE NOT PHYSICAL ACTS OF AGGRESSION THESE ARE VERBAL ACTS OF AGGRESSION SO EMBARRASSING OTHERS OR OTHERWISE SOMEHOW TRYING TO REDUCE THE WELL BEING OF OTHERS BY SAYING CERTAIN THINGS IN PARTICULAR IN GROUPS THIS STUDY EXAMINED BOTH MALES AND FEMALES THIS WAS DONE ON A BY WAY OF A COLLEGE CAMPOUS STUDY SUBJECTS WERE EIGHTEEN TO FORTY SEVEN YEARS OLD GE THERE SOME OLDER STUDENTS ON THAT CAMPUS OR MAY BE THEY USE SOME NONSTUDNTS BUT YOU KNOW THESE DAYS YOU'VE ALSO GOT SOME STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THER UNTHIRTIES AN FORTIES SO THEY HAVE A FAIRLY BROAD A SUATH OF SUBJECTS INCLUDED FAIRLY BROAD RACIAL BACKGROUND AS WELL INCLUDED NOT AT EQUAL NUMBERS BUT A AT LEAST THEY INCLUDED A PRETTY BROAD SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE O DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS THEY LOOKED IN PARTICULAR PEOPLE THAT INJESTED NONE CALFINATED ALCHOL DRINKS AT A FREQUENCY OF NINE POINT ONE EIGHT DRINKS PER WEAK AGAIN THIS A COLLEGE CAMPUS NOT THAT INCOURAGE THAT IMONTHES PEOPLE THAT IF NEVER REALLY LIKED DRUGS ARE ALCHOL ICS OR FORTUNE IN THAT WAY I CAN DRINK ORE NOT DRINK AND TEND TO NOT DRINK A BUT SO TO ME NINE POINT ET DRINK ONE EIGHT DRINKS PER WEEK SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT I KNOW FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE TYPICAL AND THEN OTHERS WHO WERE DRINKING AT LEAST ONE CALFINATED ALCOHLIC BEVERAGE PER WEAK AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS A AND AS HIGH I SHOULD SAY AS SEVEN POINT EIGHT SEVEN CALTHE NATED ALCHOL BEVERAGES PER WEAK SO THIS WOULD BE ENERGY DRINKS COMBINE TYPICALY WITH HARD ALCHOL THAT'S FAIRLY COMMONLY AVAILABLE IN BARS AND SO FORTH AND SOME INDIVIDUALS DRANK AS MUCH AS GOODNESS TWENTY POINT THREE SIX ALCOHOLIC DRINKS PER WEAT TOTAL SOME THAT WERE CALFINATED SOME THAT WERE NOT CALFINADED THE BASIC ALCOME OF THIS STUDY WAS THAT THE MORE ALCOHOL SOME ONE TENDED TO CONSUME THE MORE LIKELY IT WAS THAT THEY WOULD ENGAGE IN THESE INDIRECT AGGRESSIVE TYHT BEHAVIORS AND IN TERMS OF THE CALFINATED ALCHOLIC BEVERAGES THERE THE EFFECT WAS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING HERE I AM JUST GOING TO PARAPHRASE ARE ACTUALLY READ FROM THE STUDY QUOTE WITH REGARD TO CALFINATED ALCHOLIC BEVERAGE USE ARE FINDING INDICATED THAT HEAVIER CALFNATE ALCHOL BEVERAGE USE WAS ASSOCIATED POSITIVELY WITH INDIRECT AGGRESSION EVEN AFTER CONSIDERING ONE'S TYPICAL ALCHOL USE AND DISPOSITIONAL AGGRESSION WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT EVEN THOUGH ALCOHOL CAN BUYAS CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND EVEN THOUGH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ALREADY HAVE A DISPOSITION TOWARD BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE THERE WAS AN EFFECT THAT WAS INDEPENDENT MEANING ABOVE INBEYOND BOTH ALCOHOL AND APPREDISPOSITION MEANING IF SOME ONE WITH CONSUMING CALFINATED ALCHOLIC BEVERAGES THEY HAD A PARTICULARLY HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF ENGAGING IN INDIRECT AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR NOW THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE IN LIGHT OF THE MODEL THEY PROPOSE WHICH IS THIS SELF REGULATION MODEL THAT THAT BASILY SELF REGULATION INVOLVE SEVERAL THINGS IT INVOLVES ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BEHAVIORS AND SUPPRESSING OTHER BEHAVIOR SO AS DESCRIBE TE BEFORE BECAUSE ALCHOL TENDS TO HAVE A SEDITIVE SUPPRESSIVE EFFECT ON THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AT LEAST AFTER THE INITIAL PERIOD ITS GOING TO TEND TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PEOPLE WILL ENGAGE IN ANY TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WHERE AS CAFIN WILL INCREASE AUTONOMIC ARAUSAL AND INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOME ONE WILL ENGAGE IN A PARTICULAR TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AGGRESSIVE OR OTHERWISE SO THE COMMINATION OF CALFIAN AN ALCOHOL IS REALLY ACTING AS A TOO PRONG SYSTEM TO BUY AS PEOPLE TOWARDS MORE AN PULSIVITY THAT IS LESS SELF REGULATE TION SO IT'S REALLY YANKING YOUR A VOLITIONAL CONTROL YOUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN PREFRONTAL TOP DOWN INABITION OVER YOUR HYPOTHALEMIS FROM TOO DISTINCT EN SPECIFIC CIRCUITS BY NOW YOU SHOULD BE GETTING THE IMPRESSION THAT SELF REGULATION IS A KEY FEATURE OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY MABE EVEN YOU IS GOING TO ENGAGE IN AGGRESSIVE SPEECH OR AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR AND WE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF TOOLS THAT ONE CAN USE TO REDUCE THE PROBABILITY THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN I SUPPOSE IF THE CONTEXT WOR APPROBRATICT EVEN TAKE THOSE TOOL RECOMMENDATIONS IN JUST INVERT THEM AND INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD THAT AGGRESSIVENESS WOULD HAPPEN BUT REGARDLESS SELF REGULATION IS KEY AND INLIGHT OF THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A STUDY THAT FOCUS ON KIDS BUT THAT HAS IMPORTANT RAMIFICATIONS FOR ADULTS AS WELL AS YOU PROBABLY ARE ALREADY AWARE THERE ARE MANY KIDS OUT THERE THAT SUFFER FROM SO CALLED ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER OR EIGHTY HT THEREARE ALSO MANY ADULTS WE ARE FINDING THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM EIGHTY H AND THERE IS ALSO AN EPIDEMIC I WOULD SAY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE EIHTY HT NOW WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE TRUE CLINICAL EIGHTY H OR NOT IS NOT CLEAR WE DID AN EPISODE ALL ABOUT EIGHTY EGHT AND TOOLS FRAGHTY EGHT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT THAT EPISODE AND SOME OF THE DIGNOSTIC CRITERIA IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY CAN FINED THAT AT HUBERMAN LABDOT COM AS THIS STUDY AM ABOUT TO SHARE WITH YOU APTLY POINTS OUT THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE DIAGNOSTIC MARKER OF EIGHTY H THERE'S NO BILE MARKER OR BLOOD DRAW OR BLOOD TEST FOR EIGHTY HT WHETHER NOT ONE HAS EIGHTY HT DEPENDS ON THEIR PERFORMANCE ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COGNIVE TESTS AND BEHAVIORAL TESTS AND SELF REPORT IN ANY EVENT THE STUDY AM ABOUT TO SHARE WITH YOU EXPLORED HOW PARTICULAR PATTERN OF SUPPLEMENTATION IN KIDS WITH EIGHTY HT WAS ABLE TO REDUCE AGGRESSIVE EPISODES AND IMPULSIVITY AND INCREASE SELF REGULATION AND THE TITLE O THE STUDY IS EFFICACY OF CARNATINE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER EVEN THOUGH THEY PUT CARNATINE THE TITLE THAT WHAT THEY FOCUSED ON WAS WHETHER OR NOT A SEEDAL EL CARNATINE SUPPLEMENTATION COULD SOMEHOW ADJUST THE BEHAVIORAL TENDENCY OF THESE KIDS WITH EIGHTY HT AND TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT INDED IT DID THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF VACIDAL CARNATINE SUPPLEMENTATION ON IMPROVING SOME OF THE SYMPTOMOLOGY SYMPTOMOLOGY EXCUSE ME OF EIGHT HT A FEW DETAILS ABOUT THE STUDY THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT TO YOU THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED DOUBLE BLIND PLOCEBO CONTROL DOUBLE CROSSOVER STUDY THIS WAS DONE AS AN OUTPATIENT STUDY SO THE KIDS WEREN'T IN A HOSPITAL THEY WERE LIVING OUT IN THE WORLD THIS AGAIN WAS DONE ON YOUNGER KIDS OF THIS O SIX SIX TO THIRTEEN YEAR OLD KIDS THAT WERE DIGNOSES WITH IGHTY HT THEY RECEIVED EITHER A SELEL CARNATINE OR PLACIBO AND THEY DID ALL THE GOOD PRACTICE STUFF THAT GOOD RESEARCHES DO OF MAKING SURE THAT THE PLASIBO AND THE ASIDAL CARNTINE HAD SIMILAR LOOK N TASTE A IT WAS CONSUMED TWICE DAILY AFTER MEALS I SHOULDS MENTION THAT SEDELO CARNETINE TYPICALLY IS TAKEN IN CAPSAL FORM A OR OCCASIONALLY AN INJECTABLE FORM HERE THAT THEY WERE USING THIS AS A DRINK WHICH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS CAPISAL FORM BUT THE POWDERS JUST GOING DIRECTLY INTO LIQUID AND THE CARNITINE DOSAGE WAS ONE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PRKILEGRAM SO THER DOING THIS ACCORDING TO THE BODYWAY THESE KIDS WITH A MAXIMUM DOSAGE OF FOUR GRAM PER DAY THE QUANITY OF TE MEDICATION WAS SUPPLIED HERE ON READING FOR A PERIOD OF EIGHT WEEHKS AND EVERY EIGHT WEEKS AF NEW QUANTITY OF MEDICATION WAS SUPPLIED SO BASICALLY THIS IS A FAIRLY LONG TERM STUDY AM EXPLORING BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN WEEK EIGHT SIXTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR THEY ALSO LOOKED AT BLOOT THINGS THAT YOU COULD ONLY GET THROUGH A BLOOD DRAW SO THINGS LIKE HEMOGLABAN MATICRI REDBLOODSELL COUNT WHITEBLOODSELL COUNTISAIDER THAT THEY THESE ARE KIDS AND EVEN IF IT WERE ADULTS I THEY WERE QUITE APPROPRIATELY EXAMINING A LOD OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO CARRY OUT TO MAKE SURE FIRST OF ALL THAT BLOOD LEVELS OF CARNATINE ARE INCREASING AN INDEED THEY CONFIRM THAT BUT ALSO THAT NO AM NEGATIVE EFFECTS ARE SHOWING UP IN THE PHYSIOLOGY AS WELL AS A PSYCHOLOGY OF THESE KIDS SO FORST ILL JUST TELL YOU THE BASIC OUTCOME THE STUDY WHICH WAS HERE IN PARAPHRASIND GIVEN TWICE DAILY CARNATINE APPEARED TO BE EFFECTIVE AND WELL TOLERATED TREATMENT FOR A GROUP OF CHILDREN WITH EIGHTY EIGHTY THEY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT THE ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR COMPARED TO THESE OTHER BOYS AND NOW I'M MOVING TO THE TABLE OF RESULTS THEY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THEIR SO CALLD TOTAL PROBLEM SCORE THE TOTAL PROBLEM SCORE IS A WELL ESTABLISHED MEASURE OF BEHAVIOR OL PROBLEMS IN KIDS WITH EIHTY EIGHT SHY AND I SHOULD SAY ADULTS WITH EGHDISTY HAS TO DO WITH CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL AND LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS AND HOW WELL OR POORLY AN INDIVIDUAL TENDS TO PERFORM REDUCTIONS IN ATTENTIONAL PROBLEMS OVER ALL REDUCTIONS IN DELINQUENCY AND MOST IMPORTANT FORSAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR NOW WHAT'S ESPECIALLY NICE ABOUT THE STUDY I THINK IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IS A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS AND CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE REPEATED IN OTHER STUDIES AND OTHER LABORATORIES THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE SHIFTS IN AL CARNATINE WITHIN THE BLOOD STREAM OF THESE KIDS THAT IS THEY WERE ABLE TO CORRELATE THE PHYSIOLOGY WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES UNOW IN STUDIES LIKE THIS AND FRANKLY IN ALL STUDIES OF HUMAN PHROMPHARMOCHOLOGY YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT EFFECTS THAT SHOW UP NOT JUST BECAUSE OF PLACIBO EFFECTS BUT BECAUSE OF SO CALLED OFF TARGET EFFECTS OR RELATED THINGS TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF THE DRUG OVER THE PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENT THEY HAPPENTO BE LOOKING AT NOT TO PUT IN THE WORDS OF A A GREAT NORSIN TIS UNFORTUNATE HE PASSED AWAY A SOME YEARS AGO BUT HE WAS A MEMBER THE NATIONAL CADEMY EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED A NERA SCIENTIST A ONCE TURN TO ME AND SAID NEVER FORGET A DRUG IS A SUBSTANCE THAT WHEN INJECTED INTO AN ANIMAL ARE A HUMAN BEING CREATES A PAPER MEANING YOU CAN SEE EFFECTS OF PRETTY MUCH ANY DRUG OR ANY SUPPLEMENT IN MOST ALL CONDITIONS HOWEVER IT IS IN CASES SUCH AS THIS STUDY WHERE YOU CAN QUITE CONVINCINGLY SEE THAT THE PARTICULAR FEATURE OF PHYSIOLOGY THAT YOU EXPECTED TO CHANGE ACTUALLY CHANGED AND YOU SEE A PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOME THAT YOU CAN GAIN MUCH GREATER CONFIDENCE THAT THE CHANGES IN DELINQUENCY IN THIS CASE REDUCE DELINQUENCY IMPROVED ATTENTION REDUCE AGGRESSIVENESS AND SO FORTH WAS AT LEAST SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE SHIFT IN BLOOD PHYSIOLOGY AND LEVELS OF ALCARNATINE OR A SEEDAL OL CARNATINE AND CARNATINE IN THE BLOOD STREAM OF THESE CHILDREN AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING ELSE LIKE ALCARNATINE GOING AND EFFECTING SOME DOWNSTREAM TARGET THAT YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF NOW OF COURSE THAT STILL ENTIRELY POSSIBLE BUT I THINK STUDIES SUCH AS THESE INCREASE OUR CONFIDENCE THAT THINGS LIKE ALCARNATINE CAN BE USED PERHAPS IN CONCERT WITH THINGS LIKE O MAGA THREE SUPPLEMENTATION DIETS THAT ARE BY AS TOWARDS INCREASING MORE TRIP TOFANINE THEREFORE OR CERATONAN OBVIOUSLY AVOIDING THINGS LIKE ALCAUL AND AS IT APPEARS FROM THE STUDY I JUST DESCRIBED REDUCING ONCE INTAKE OR NOT CONSUMING ANY CALFINATED ALCOLIC REVERAGES SEEMS LIKE COULD BE GOOD IDEA OF YOUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE AGGRESSIVENESS TO THINK ABOUT THE HORMONE CONTEXT AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU TEND TO HAVE HIER TESTOSTRONE AND ESTERIGEN OR LOWER TESTOSTERN O ESTROGEN MAYBE EN THING ABOUT THE WORK ENVIRONMENT WHETHER NOT YOU ARE EXISTING IN A PARTICULARLY COMPETIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND EVEN DAYLENGTH TIME OF YEAR AND WHETHER OR NOT YOUR GETTING SUFFICIENT SUNLIGHT WHETHER NOT YOUR AVOIDING LIGHT IN THE EVENING AND SO ON SO STUDIES SUCH AS THIS I THINK ARE USEFUL BECAUS THEY POINT TO THE FACT THAT VERY SELDOM IF EVER WILL THERE BE ONE SUPPLEMENT OR ONE NUTRITIONAL CHANGE OR EVEN ONE BEHAVIORAL CHANGE THAT'S GOING TO COMPLETELY SHIFT AN INDIVIDUAL FROM BEING AGGRESSIVE AND IMPULSIVE BUT RATHER THAT BY COMBINING DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL REGIMENTS BY PAYING ATTENTION TO THINGS LIKE TIME OF YEAR  AND WORK CONDITIONS AND SCHOOL CONDITIONS AND OVER ALL LEVELS OF STRESS AND LIKELY THEREFORE LEVELS OF CORTIZAL ET CETERA THAT YOU CAN USE BEHAVIORS DIET AND PSUPPLEMENTATION AS A WAY TO SHIFT THAT OVERALL INTERNAL MILLU FROM ONE OF PROVIDING A LOT OF INTERNAL HYDRALIC PRESSURE AS IT'S BEEN CALLED THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE TOWARD AGGRESSIVE IMPULSIVITY AND RELAX SOME OF THAT HYDRAULIC PRESSURE AND REDUCE AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES SO ONCE AGAIN AND FRANKLY AS ALWAYS WE'VE DONE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE NERBIOLOGY AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF OUR LIVES IN THIS CASE AGGRESSION ON A POINT OUT THAT IN A EPISODE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE I'M GOING TO BE HOSTING DOCTOR PROFESSOR DAVID ANDERSON FROM CALTIC UNIVERSITY WHO IS THE WORLD EXPERT ON THE NERBIOLOGY OF AGGRESSION IN FACT HE IS THE SENIOR AUTHOR ON MANY OF THE STUDIES RELATED TO THE VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALEMUS THAT I DISCUSS TO DAY OUR DISCUSSION WILL TOUCH ON AGGRESSION OF COURSE SO HEARING TO DAYS UP SODE WILL HELP YOU DIGESTS THAT INFORMATION BUT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT OTHER EMOTIONAL STATES HE IS AN EXPERT NONCIHOUS IN AGGRESSION BUT IN MOTIVATED STATES RELATED TO SECTS AND MADING BEHAVIOR A SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL KINDS AND HOW THOSE RELATE NOT JUST A BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY BUT ALSO CERTAIN FORMS OF PATHOLOGY THINGS LIKE P T S T AND THE RELATIONSHIP FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN ANGER FEAR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT I KNOW MANY OF YOU IF NOT ALL OF YOU WILL BE INTERESTED IN IN THE MEANTIME I WANT A POINT YOU TO HIS RECENTLY RELEASED AND WONDERFUL BOOK ENTITLE THE NATURE OF THE BEAST HOW EMOTIONS GUIDE US AND AGAIN THE AUTHOR IS DAVID ANDERSON FROM CALTEC THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK IT SERVES AS A TREMENDOUS INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF THE STUDY OF THESE AREAS THE CURRENT SCIENCE AND DISCOVERIES BEING MADE IN THESE AREAS ALL MADE ACCESSIBLE TO THE SCIENTIST AND NON SCIENTIST ALIKE ITS HAVE A VERY ENGAGING READ AND SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS GRACIOUS IN SENDING ME A COPY I ALSO PURCHASE MYSELF A COP BE TO GIVE TO SOMEBODY WHO IS A THERAPIS AND I HAVE PURCHASED ANOTHER COPY TO GIVE TO A HIGH SCHOOL KID THAT I MENTOR BECAUSE HE'S VERY INTERESTED IN THE NOROW SCIENCE OF EMOTIONS AND I THINK WE ARE ALL INTERESTED IN EMOTIONS NOTJUST FEAR AND SOME OF THESE NEGATIVE STATES NOT JUST AGGRESSION BUT ALSO THE POSITIVE EMOTIONS OF OUR LIVES AND SO THE NATURE OF THE BEAST HOW EMOTION GUIDE US BY DAVID ANDERSON IS A WONDERFUL READ I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY ENOUGH IF YOUR LEARNING FROM AND ORE ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBE T OUR U TUBE CHANNEL THAT'S A TERRIFIC

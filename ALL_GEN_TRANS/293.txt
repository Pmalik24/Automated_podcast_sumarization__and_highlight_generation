CONSEQUENCES ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS THE MANUAL BERRY TELLS WHAT HAPPEN I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE BACHELOR FOR YEARS AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED ON EPISODE NINE OF SEASON TWENTY THREE THERE'S THIS ONE MOMENT THAT FELT SO REAL THAT I HAVEN'T SHUT UP ABOUT IT OGAT SO IT'S ALMOST THE LAST EPISODE OF THE SEASON IT'S THE BACHELOR SO OF COURSE THE FILMING IN A ROMANTIC LOCATION A BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY IN PORTUGAL THE BACHELOR THIS TIME AROUND IS CULLIN UNDERWOOD HIS TWENTY SIX TALL SANDY HAIR HANDSOME A FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYER AND AS THE SHOW HAS MENTIONED A MILLION TIMES HE'S A VERGIN I COULD CARELESS ONMINE I SAW FANS OF THE SHOW DESCRIBE IN THE SPEET AND SINCERE MY ROOMAITE ONCE CALLED HIM A MERICAS CHICKEN NUGGET REFALSO ALLFLE BY MAN OF THI IM DOWN OHEF E THE SHOW IS A MONDAY NIT TRADITION IN MY APARTMENT MY ROOMA AND I OPEN A BOTTLE OF RED WINE AND FOR TWO HOURS WE ENJOY SOME CORIOGRAPHED DRAM OUT CANTESTONS WHO AREN'T THERE FOR THE RIGTE REASON BACHELORS WHO

COLTAN HAS BEEN DUMPED BY THE GIRL OF HIS DREEMS HE HAS SHUT HIMSELF INTO HIS ROOM  OEOMHE SAYS I'M DONE I'M DONE WITH THIS CUW THE MOST DRAMATIC MUSIC HE THROWS OPEN THE DOOR AND HIS HAND IS SUDDENLY COVERING THE ENTIRE TETI SCREEN THEN THIS STRANGE THING HAPPENS SUDDENLY THE INVISIBLE TV CREW BECOMES VERY VISIBLE CAMMERMEN FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE FRAME COLTAN IS RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS HE'S TAKING OFF HIS MIGHT AND THE PRODUCERS START CALLING FOR CHRIS TEMMING IN RAN   CHRIS HARRISON IS THE HOST OF THE SHOW WHOSE FOREVER POPPING INTO SCENES UNANNOUNCE AND I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE WEIGHT WHY ARE YOU HERE COLAN'S WAKING AWAY FROM CHRIS IGNORING EVERY ONE AND THEN HE REACHES HIS BIG WHITE FENCE LIKE AN INDUSTRIAL SECURITY GATE IT'S MADE ME LIKE EIGHT FEET TALL AND WITHOUT HESITATION IN ONE POWERFUL GRACEFUL MOVEMEN HE LEAPS UP AND PULLS HIMSELF OVER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE IN A HEART MAT IT'S THE TYPE OF MOVE CAPTAIN AMERICA WITH YOU AND THEN CHRIS HARRISON UTTERS WHAT IS PERHAPS MY FAVOURITE LINE IN THE HISTORY OF THE BACHELOR T CHUM  ER BUT LITT THE CREW TAKES WHAT FEELS LIKE A WHILE TO ACTUALLY GET THE GATE OPEN AND WHEN THEY FINALLY DO COLTAN IS GONE HE IS GONE THE BACHELOR HAS ESCAPED FOR THREE MINUTES I WATCH AS THEY SEARCH FOR HIM CALLING HIS NAME SOME ONE STARTS WHISTLING LIKE THER LOOKING FOR A DOG ALT OLHI'VE NOTOREE  TIGET INTO CARS AND THEY'R DRIVING AROUND AND FINALLY THEY SPOT HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD COLAN KEEPS WALKING AWAY CHRIS TRIES TO GET HIM TO TALK MANAGES TO GET HIM TO WALK TOWARD A CAR BUT COLAN IN SAYS IT'S OVER HE SAYS I CAN'T DO THIS I'M DONE THEN COMMERCIAL AN WHEN WE COME BACK IT'S THE NEXT DAY IN ITS BRIGHT AND SUNNY AND CHRIS HARRISON IS NOCKING ON COLTAN'S DORED O TALK AND AT ALL FEEL SORT OF NORMAL IWELL AND I'M WATCHING AT HOME AND I'M CONFUSED LIKE DIDN'T HE JUST SAY HE WAS DONE WITH THE SHOW YET HERE HE IS TALKING WITH CHRIS PLANNING HIS NEXT MOVE ON THE SHOW IT'S NEVER EXPLAINED HOW COLTON WENT FROM RUNNING AWAY AND QUITTING TO BEING BACK IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS LIKE WHERE DID HE GO HOW LONG WAS HE GONE AND MOST IMPORTAN WHAT MADE HIM DESIDE TO COME BACK LIKE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THE TEVY SHOW GAVE NO SATISFYING ANSWER TO ANY OF THAT SO HEY COLLON HAY ARE YOU GOOD HAWE YOU DON I CALL IN COLAN SAYS WHEN HE SIGNED UP TO BE THE BACHELOR HE'D ALREADY BEN ON THE BACHELORETT SO HE BELIEVED HE UNDERSTOOD HOW THE SHOW WORKED I THOUGHT THAT I DID I THOUGHT THAT I HAD A LOT OF IT FIGURED OUT AND I WAS WRONG HE EXPLAINED THAT THE WHOLE FENCE JUMP GOES BACK TO A CONFUSION OF HIS OWN MAKING SO ON EACH EPISOD THERERE DATES WITH THE BACHELOR SOMMER ONE AN ON SOME ARE BIG THROUP DATES AND SOMETIMES CONTESTANS DON'T GET SELECTED FOR A DATE AT ALL WHICH SUX BECAUSE IT'S REALLY THE ONLY TYINE YOU GET TO SPEND WITH THE BACHLARE AND COLN TOLD ME SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW WATCHING THE SHOW THAT TO FIGURE OUT WHO GOES ON THESE DAYS PRODUCERS ARE CONSTANTLY CHECKING IN WITH THE BACHELOR THE VIGURE OUT WHO HE LIKE  S LIKE ONE OF TWOMEN HE INITUALLY HITET OFF WITH WAS HANNA THEY ALWAYS CAST YOU KNOW TER RANK THE GIRLS AND VERY EARLY ON HANNA WAS UP THERE A AND SHE OT LEFT OFF TO DATE IN OTHER WORDS IN THE BEGINNING WHEN THEY WERE OVER TWHENTY CONTESTANCE THIS WOMAN HANNAH WAS HIS NUMBER ONE PICK BUT THEY DIDN'T KETGEL A DATE WITH HER AND I SHORT OF RECALL REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE BURNT WHEN THEY DID THAT I WAS LIKE SO LIMIGAT THIS STRAIGHT HANNAS NUMBER ONE ON MY LISTER ANOWN SHE'S NOT GETTING AT DATE THIS WEEK SO FROM THERE ON NOW I WAS LIKE ARE IGH IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT TO MY TOP GIRLS I'M NOT REALLY GOING TO TELL YOU WHO MY TOP GIRLS ARE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU MESSING WITH THEM SO IN A WEIRD WAY I TRIED TO DEFEND MYSELF AND TEFEND THE GIRLS BY NOT BEING TRUTHFUL TO THEM WHOM MY TOP WAS SO EVEN AFTER HANNA STOPPED BEING HIS FAVORITE I JUST KEPT THE TOP THE SAME SO HANNAH WAS ALWAYS AT THE TOP OF LIST WHEN I ALWAYS MADE THE LIST FOR THEM TO SEE AND I NEVER CHANGED IT IT' SO INTERESTING CAUSE IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE LIKE LEARNING THEIR GAME AND THEN COMING UP WITH WAYS TO SORT OF LIKE EITHER FOILET AR LIKE PROTECT YOURSELF OR LIKE PUT YOURSELF IN A BETTER POSITION LIKE DID YOU FIND YOURSELF DOING THAT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS WELL YES SO LIKE THAT TDUCHESS ME WANTING TO SET MYSELF UP FOR SUCCESS WHILE COLAN KEPT PUTTING HANNA AS HIS NUMBER ONE PICK EACH WEEK THE GIRL HE FELL FOR HARDEST WAS ACTUALLY CASSY I O TO LOIK A MAZIN ARY IT GE TI FEEL ONE HIG COLSIN A OS I YOU LIKELETI HALF E CATESTY AND I  CAN FECY YUS THATY MAT SHE'S GOT A SERFRFIVE ON HAIR AN SHY WAVES THEY HAD CHEMISTRY BUT AS IF YOU WERE SHE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A FRONT RUNNER I KIND OF KEPT FOR GETTING WHO CASSY WAS I THINK WITH CAST BESTWAY TO DESCRIBE OUR RELATIONSHIP AS IT WAS SUCH A SLOWBURN A AND IT WAS IN A IN A WEIRD WAY IN THE DYNAMIC OF THE BASHELOR FRANCHISES WORDSPOSED TO BE QUICK AND FAST AN INTENSE IT WAS SHORT OF A RELIEF TO FIND A NORMAL RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH IT WAS A SLOWER BURN AND WHICH IT WAS IT WAS A MORE REALISTIC APPROACH TO A RELATIONSHIP AND AM I DON'T I THINK OI'E JUST IT WAS ALMOST LIKE WHEN I WAS AS CASSES LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR SO TOWARD THE END OF THE SEASON THEY'RE DOWN TO JUST THREE WOMEN  CASSY HIS FAVORITE HANNA WHO THE PRODUCERS THINK IS HIS DAVORITE ANTATIA THE TOKEN BLACK GIRL THEYARE ALL IN PORTUGAL AND THEY EACH HAVE AN OVERNIGHT DATE SCETGELD OF COLAN BUT SOME ONE HAS TO BE ELIMINATED BY THE END OF TH EPISODE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PRODUCERS INTENDED THEY DECLINED MY REQUEST FOR AN INTERVIEW BUT WATCHING THE SHOW IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET CASSY TO QUITK THEY THREW A WRENCH AND HER IN COLTON'S RELATIONSHIP A WRENCH SHAPED LIKE CASSY'S DAD COLAN HAD MET CASSY'S DAD IN AN EARLIER EPISODE WHEN HE ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO PROPOSE MIND YOU HE DID THIS FOR NEARLY ALL THE REMAINING CONTESTANTS MA CASSY'S DAD SAID NO SI SHELL LIKE AS FAR AS THE HAND IN MARRIAGE THAT WOULD BE A PRAMENT HROR BLESSING  SHE WER BUT NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANT HERE A WEEK LATER IN PORTUGAL COLAN CERTAIN ABOUT CASSY CASSY'S CONFUSED AGAIN I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE PRODUCERS WERE THINKING BUT WHEN I WAS WATCHING IT IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE FORCING CASSY'S HAND THE SHOW ALLOWS A SPECIAL GESS TO VISIT LATER IN THAT EPBISOED HER DAD ACTUALLY SHOWS UP WHICH NOBODY JUST ACCIDENTALLY SHOWS UP IN PORTUGALS SO T PRODUCERS THE PRODUCERS PAYD AND A PRETTY HEAPTHY PRICE TO FLY THAT MAN ON OUT TO PORTUGAL TO COME VISITS SPEND TIME WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO GIVE HER CLARITY CASSY'S DAD TALKS TO HER AND SHE DECIDES TO LEAVE THE SHELL THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY HESITATION IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOU MEE SOMEBODY THAT YOU WONCE BEN RES YOUR LIFEWITHNONE LIFE WONG DECISION IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU MAKE IF YOU'RENTURE CASSY DECIDES TO TELICAL AN AT DINNER NORMALLY DURING THE DINNERS AND DURING THAT YOU KNOW THE PRODUCERS OR OUR SORT HOVERING OR THERE AROUND TO HELP THE CONVERSATION FLOW OR THER THERE JUST TIL LIKE BOUNCE IDEAS OFF OF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GAS HER TALKING WHEN WE HAD THAT DINNER THERE WASN'T A PRODUCER IN SIGHT UM THERE WAS JUST A CAMERAS AND THERE WAS JUST TH AUDIOS EVERYBODY ELSE RAN UM AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE NEAR IT BECAUSE I THINK THEY KNEW THAT I KNEW KNEW THAT THEY SET AB OUT HE MEANS AT DINNER CASSY TELLS HIM SHE'S LEAVING AND SHE MENTIONS THAT HER DAD IS HERE IN PORTUGAL AND THAT THEY'VE BEEN TALKING COLLAN CLEARLY HAS NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING AND HE TURNS AS THOUGH LOOKING FOR SOME ONE OH I'VE THING I JUST GOT SCREWED I WAS THINKING THAT YOU KNOW THAT WASN'T HER DOING I KNOW WHAT THE FOREMEND OF THE SHOW IS AND FOR ME HEARING HAY BY THE WAY MY DAD CAME BACK REALLY LIKE SPARK SOMETHING IN MEAS I COL OKI SO IG DON'T HAVE THE CONTROL I THOUGHT I HAD IF I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW MY RELATIONSHIPS CANTO BE MESST WITH OR TOID WITH AT ALL I'M GOING TO BE DONE ESPECIALLY AT THIS POINT I'VE COMPLETELY FLING LOVE I'VE COMPLETELY LIKE GAVE MYSELF ALL TO HER I MEAN I HAD NOTHING TO LOSE AT THAT POINT BESIDES THE GIRL AND THE WOMAN HAT I WANTED TO SPEN THE REST I MY LIFE WITH SO COIN'S ABOUT TO LOSE THE GIRL THAT HE LOVES AND IN A PERVERSE WAY IT'S KIND OF HIS FAULT WHEN COLLNS ARED LYING ABOUT WHO HE LIKE MOST ON HIS LIST  SHOWS I REALLY BUILT FOR THAT IS AS IF AN INANIMATE TEST SUBJECT SUDDENLY BECAME SENTIET BASICALLY COMPROMISED THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT HES SORT OF PLAYED HIMSELF I THINK THAT BACK FIRE BECAUSE THEN THEY WERE LIKE WO WE THOUGHT IT WAS HANNA BECAUSE YOU KEPT TELLING US LIKE EVEN ON YOUR LIST LIKE WHEN YOUD RANKAM LIKE CANNA'S ONE AND AND SO IN THE END CASSIANDS A BASELY SOT

WHAT HE SAID BUT I KNOW WHAT HE FELT IT WAS AS CLEAR TO ME AS IF HE'D WHISPERED AT RIGHT INTO MY EAR GHOST SINCE AFRICA I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE ORIGINS OF THE SUIT THAT'S FAR BACK AS THE NINETIES THE MILITARY HA'D BEEN POURING MONEY INTO RESEARCHING MELONAN IT WAS KNOWN THAT CERTAIN BIRDS USED THE CAMICAL TO CHANGE COLOR SO IT WAS A NO BRAINER THAT DEFENCE WOULD BE LOOKING AT IT AS A WAY TO CAMOFLA TROOPS SOME SCIENTISTS ALSO HYPOTHESIZED THAT IT WAS MELONAN THAT GAVE BLOODWORMS THEIR INCREDIBLE JAW STRENGTH BUT I DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT BLOOD WORMS WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE SUIT WAS NOT DESIEN TO STOP OR REPELL BULLETS IT'S NOT ARMOR SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THE SUIT IS CHANGING EVOLVING AND I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHOSE WEARING IT I KNOW THES IS GOIN TO SOUND CRAZY BUT WHEN I WAS A SOPHOMORAT HOWARD THE SENIOR WITH AN ONK AROUND HIS NECK USED TO FOLLOW ME THROUGH THE CUID CALLON ME QUEEN AND PREACHING TO ME ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OF COMMITIC SPIRITUALITY I BET HE WOULD A HAD A FIEL DAY WITH THIS SUIT HE'D SAY THE CONCENTRATED MELONAND MUST BE AMPLIFYING ANCIENT AFRICAN MISTICISM OR WHATEVER HE'D SAY THE SUIT WAS HELPING ME CHANEL MY ANCESTORS HELL HE'D PROBABLY PAINTO SAN COPHER IN THE CHEST AND TEACH HIMSELF OW TO FLY HE WAS FULL ET I COUNTABULLSHIP ME I'MTHING IN THE SUIT NEVER SHOULD A BEEN MADE AT ALL THAT IS THE RESULT OF COCKY SCIENCE ASSHOLES AND SOLDIERS HACKING INTO NATURAL POWER THEY DON'T UNDE STAND AND CAN'T CONTROL FROM THE FEW VERY GUARDED CONVERSATIONS THAT I WAS ABLE TO HAVE ABOUT THIS WITHOUT SETTING OFF ALARMBELLS OVER AT THE PENAGON THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED WITH THE SUIT WHOEVER REPORTED SIDE EFFECTS LIKE MINE THAT BROTHER A TOUGH EX MARINE FROM SOUTH FILLY IT'S CURRENTLY

AWAY CLEAN TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS SIMPLY NOT SOMETHING I COULD LET GO HE WAS A LOOSE END THAT NEEDED TO BE TIED OFF 'SLIPPING INTO A SECURE MILITARY HOSPITAL SOUNDS DIFFICULT BUT NOT WHEN YOU HAVE A TOP SECRET CLOAKING THE VICE BUT WHEN EVERY ONE INSIDE ALREADY THINKS YOU'RE A NURSE I'M ON THE RIGHT FLOOR IN THE CORRECT WARD BEFORE I EVEN HAVE TO PUT THE SUIT ON I STARE AT IT FOR A MINUT IT'S AN EMPENETRABLE IMPOSSIBLE MAT BLACK BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU GAZE INTO THE FABRIC IT'S EVERY COLOR IN THE SPECTROM  FEELS GOOD TO PUT IT BACK ON I REALIZE AS IT BINDS TO MY SKIN THAT I'VE BEEN

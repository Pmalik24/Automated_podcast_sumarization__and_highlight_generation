JOBIDON'S TEAM TRIES TO TEACH HIM NOT TO TRIP AS THE PRESIDENT VISITO UNITED AUTO WORKERS PICKET LINE DO EVIDENCE SHOWS HUNTER BIDIN OOK A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OLLAR CHECK FROM THE CHINESE AND IT WAS SENT TO JOBDON'S HOUSE AND FORM TRUMP AIGHT CACITY HUTCHINSON MAKES THE ROUNDS WITH SOME JUICY TALES I BENTHFEAR THIS IS VENCHVIRO SHO  TO DAY SHO IS PONTER BA EXPRESSIVE PIAN THOUSANDS F MILITERS OF ALREADY SECURED THE NETWORKDAY TO JOIN THEM EXPRESSLY PIANTICOM FLASHMENT ALREADY SO JOBIDON'S NUMBERS CONTINUE TO LOOK ABSOLUTELY AWFUL THERE'S A BRAN NEW PULL OUT AND IT SHOWS THAT JOBIDEN'S NUMBERS AGAIN REMAIN JUST DEVASTATINGLY BAD FOR EXAMPLE THIS ENB S NEWSPOLE THAT JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT SHOWS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A TWENTY ONE POINT ADVANTAGE ON THE ECONOMY FORTY NINE PER CENTS OF REGISTERED VOTERS PICK THE JEOPE TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT PICK THE DEMOCRATS THAT IS THE BIGGEST LEAD REPUBLICANS HAVE HELD ON THAT QUESTION SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REMEMBER JOBIDON LIKE MORE ON DECIDED THA HE'S GOING TO BRAND HIS ENTIRE ECONOMIC PROGRAM BIDONOMICS WHICH GIVES A SHORT HAND TO HIS REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS TWO NOW HANG THE ECONOMY AROUND HIS NECK THERE CAN O DO THAT ANYWAY BUT NOW HE HIMSELF HAS CUT ADS FOR THEM SAYING BIDONOMICS HIS WORKING OVER AND OVER CREEPILY INTO A MACROPHON BIDONOMIC HIS LORC LIKE JUST JUCK TOPOSE THAT FOOTAGE WITH ALL OF THE INFLATION STAFFS JOCKS SUPPOSE ALL OF THAT FOOTAGE WITH THE STAGNATING ECONOMY HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND ITS NOT KON WORK WHILE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IS A REALLY REALLY BAD NUMBERS FOR JOBIDON AND SO YOU'R WONDERING WHY IT IS THAT EVERY MAJOR NATIONAL POLLS ONAL TRUMP IS RUNNING EITHER EVEN TO OR ABOVE JOBIDEN THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE IT JOBIDON IS TERRIBLE AT THE PRESIDENTING WELL EVEN JAMES CARVILL WHO OF COURSE IS A DEMOCRAT POLSTOR ANALIST EVEN CARVILL IS LIKE SOMEBODY OVER THEIRE NEES TO WAIT TO AFOT BECAUSE TRUMP COULD EASILY WHIN THE ELECTION RETETOM ELECTION WIT NODEMBE ATHORITO TIS ER AN AN THE FE TECARODITES ON JO JOBIN GE DEMOCRA DOTROTEPOBCO AJOBATIONA RAHO NOBIBO AN CORDEWA TRUMP WOULD BE BATIN FABRATE YOE PA TO YOU IUL LI YOU EVEN MARNIY YOU WOULD NOT TIP THAT BET I OR ON SO SHUT BOUT IT BETTER WORK O A CARVILL IS NOT WRONG ABOUT THIS AGAIN THE POLES ARE A LITTLE BIT DISPRIT HE HAD THE POLE FROM A B S NEWS WASHINGTON POST WITH TRUMP UP TEN AND THAT CAM ATC ITS COUPLE OF DAYS GOING OWTHRS A NEW MORNING CONSUL POLL HITH JUL BIDIN UP ONE BUT BIDIN UP ONE MEANS THAT BIDINS WHENING FORTY THREE PER CENT OF THEIR VOTE THAT IS A FORTY THRE FORTY TO RACE O THE QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER THERE'S A CEALING FOR TRUMP OR WHETHER THERE IS A CEALING FOR BIDON WHO'S THE SELECTION GOING TO BE A REUGHERANDUM ON WELL MEANWHILE JOBDONS TEAM IS PHYSICALLY ATTEMPTING I KIN YOU NOT TO STOP HIM FROM TRIPPING IS AN ARTICLE NOT NOT LIKE TRIPPING ON ONDRUGS LIKE ACTUALLY JUST PHYSICALLY TRIPPING AND FALLING DOWN ACCORDING TO ACTIOS PRESIDENT BIDN AND HIS CAMPAIN ARE WORKING ON A CRITICAL PROJECT FOR HIS REELECTION BID MAKE SURE HE DOESNA TRIP THINGS ARE GOING AMAZING O VER AT THE BIDON CAMPAN I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE DOWN TRUMS DESCRIPTION OF JOBIDON WALKING COUPLE WEK'S GOING ON INTERVIEW CONTINUES TO BE THE SINGLE BYS DESCRIPTION JOBIDON WALKING DOWN FOR T HE LIK TAK E'S WATCING ON TO BAKES EVERYDEMUAT THEU'L THINK HE'S WAKGANTE  AND THAT THAT IS TRUE IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE IS DESPERATELY ATTEMPTING NOT TO FALL OVER ACCORDING TO AXIOS AS VOTERS EXPRESS SDEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THE EIGHT YEAR OLD PRESIDENT'S AGENT FIN IS FOR OFFICE BIDENS HEMIS TAKING EXTRA STEPS TO PREVENT HIM FROM STUMBLING IN PUBLIC WITH A PHYSICAL THERAPIS BIDIN HAS BEEN DOING EXERCISES TO IMPROVE HIS BALANCE AS FAR BACK HIS NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE HE'S LEARING TENNIS SHOTES MORE OFTEN

TEIR SEEING CONTRACTORS PAT WHEN YOUR ASKD ABOUT ONO THE SPECIFICS OF THAT  YOU SEEWE SANG YEGA O ONE EIN TO THE SPECI  THE TE DISPUTES O IS HE NOT STANDING WIT TEM ON THE TERMS WIT WI THEIR TRYING TO GOTI I MEAN TO BE VERY CLER HE'S STANDING WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A FAIRSHARE THAT IS WHAT HE'S STANDING WITH THEM ON HE'S STANDING WITH THEM AND WE'VE SAID THIS THAT THAT THEY  THAT WE THET THEY GET THE RECORD THE RECORD A PROFITS MEAN A RECOR CONTRACT FOR YOU A DOB THAT IS WHY HE'S GOING THAT IS WHAT HE'S STANDING FOR I THEY DESERVE A FAIRSHARE F OF THE VALUE THAT THEY HELPED CREATE THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SAY BUT THE DETAILS THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT MAKES BOTH SIDES HAPPYO OR ANYTHING IN THOSE NEGOTIATE AT THE NEGOTIATION TABLE THAT IS FOR THEM TO DESIDE THAT WELL THEN WHAT'S HE DOING THERE IT'S IT THE N  HE HAS NO POSITION ON HOWVIS NEGOTIATION COMES OUT HE'S JUST LITERALLY PUTTING ON THE HAT OF ONE OF THE PARTIES IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE A MEDIATOR CAN TIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN CONTRACTORS FUSERS A MEDIATOR IMAGINE THE MEDIATOR COMES IN RAT'S HIS FE BETWEEN YOU AND ME AND HE MEDER COMES IN WEARING A DAILY WIRE HAT WHICH SIDES YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO TAKE IN THAT MEDIATION THIS IS SO RIDICULOUS IT'S RIDICULOUS BUT HE'S RI DICULOUS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MEANWHILE THE LINE THAT IS BEING USED HERE BY THE DEMOCRAT IS THAT JOBIE IS ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUE HE'S OVERSEEN A MANUFACTURING RENISSENCE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES TEBBE STAB ANO SENATOR FROM FROM MICHIGAN SHE SAYING THAT THAT JOBIDON CAN TAKE SIDE OF THE UA DBLE YOU BECAUSE HE'S BRINGING MANUFACTURING JOBS BACK TO AMERICA AS ONE OF THE BIG LIES THAT THE JOBINON TELLS EXPLORING JUST A SECOND IN FACT THE RATEAT WHICH MANUFACTURING JOBS OUR BEING MET OUR BEING CREATED IN THE UNITED STATES IS PRECISELY THE SAME ACROSS ADMINISTRATIONCS BUT HERE IS A DEBBY STAB IN O LINE AN FOR E ALL WORKERS WHAT IS SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRESIDENT BEING THERE TO THET WELL WELL T'S ALWAYS GREAT TO BE WITH ALL IN EI HAT E JUST A Y SAYNG IT ITS SISTAR THAT WE HAVE PRESAN I SAYS THAT WOULD BE JOIN IN WITH TO UNIN I A  AT LIME SHE'S ACT SHALLY MANINGE I OVERSEENG TO LARTOS MANUTACTIN AN A SIN IN OHOS TR F FOR ALL OF A IN IR LI TASR OUTRATING LOR CO TO WAR TO MATR THER GOOD PAN JOBS I' GET WELL THAT'S ALIE WE'N HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS A CHART FROM THE FEDERAL RES OR BANK OF SAINT LOUIS OF MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED OVERTIME WHA HE SEES THRE'S A MASS OF DECLINE AN MANUFACTURING JOBS IN HE UNITED STATES DURING THE REAT RECESSION FROM TWO THOUSAND AHES TO THOUSANIME AND THEN IT STARTED TO SLOWLY CLIME AND ITS CONTINUE TO SLOWLY CLIME ALL THE WAY UNTIL BOUT MID TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND THEN THE PANDEMICET AND THEN AFTER THE PANDEMICET IT DIVED AND THEN A KIND OF INCREASED BACK TO WHERE IT WAS KIND OF AFOR SO NO IT TURNS OUT THE MANUFACTURING COBS HAVE NOT BEEN WILDLY COMING BACK TO TH UNITED STATES UNDER EITHER TRUMP OR UNDER JOBIDON AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE OF PARSHALLY UNION CONTRACTS IT TURNS OUT ITS REALLY EXPENSIVE TO DO LABOR IN THE UNITED STATES SE'VE HAD TECK UP TECKS RIHT PEOPLE IN CREDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ROBOTIC THAT IS TIK IF IT'S THAT EXPENSIVE TO HIRE TH U A B WY NOT TO BUILD THE MACHINES THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE THOSE WORKERS OFF THE LINE IN THE UNITED STATES MANUFACTURING SECTOR PRODUCTIVITY HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EVEN IS EMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN BY ABOUT ONE THIRD A GAIN THAT IS THAT IS BECAUSE MACHINES THAT IS BECAUSE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES WERE NEVER CAN TO GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WITH THE PERCENTAGE O PEOPLE WHO ARE IN MANUFACTURING BUT THE NOTION THAT THE JOBITON CAN STAND WITH TH U A U AND MAKE LABOR IN THE UNITED STATES MORE EXPENSIVE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE THE NUMBER MANUFACTURING JOBS IT BELIES PRETYMUCH ALL DATA MEANWHILE STEVE RATNER WHO IS THE OBOMA ADMINISTRATIONS CARS ARE ACTUALLY SLAM JOBITDON FOR DOING ALL OF THIS I SAID FRM TO BE GOING ONTHE PICKET LINES OUTRAGEOUS SO THERE'S NO PRECEDENT FOR IT THE TRADITION OF THE PRESIDENT IS STAN NEUTRAL IN TESE THINGS I GET THE POLITICS THE PROGRESSIVES ALL SEID WE DON'T WANT A MEDIATER ONE ADVOCATE ANDHE BOUDST THE PROGRESSIVES NOW HE'S CAN GO OUT THE AND PUT HIS THUM ON THE SKILL EN IS WRONG HE'S HE'S IN FAVOR OF THE U A UW GETTING SMORE BENEFITS RE SETT INCREASINGLY MILITANT YOU A DOUBLE YOU IS IT OVERPLAYING TOWN WITH AN OVERLY LANGTHY AN OVERLY AMBITIOUS LIST OF DEMANDS IS I A PROLONGE STRIKE WHICH QUICKLY TO FAR MORE WIDESPREAD SHUT DOWNS OR AUTO OF AUTOFICILITIES COULD JUPPARDIZE THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY ARE NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR AUTO INDISTRY ACOUNTS FOR THREE PERCENTS OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT WITH PARTICULAR CONCENTRATION IN THE MID WEST WERE STATES LIKE MICHICAN OUR CRITICAL TO BIDN REELECT EFFORT SOYIN THAT TOBOMAZON CARS AR SAING THSS IS INSANE YOU CAN'T DO THIS MEANWHILE WHERE DID JOBIDON GO AND HIS COALITION BASICALLY RANG OUT IS UNION HEADS MINORITIES COLGIGE CAT WHITE LIT WHITE LADIES THAT THAT THAT IS THE COALITION FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AN JOBDN WAS TRYING TO RING ALL THAT TOGETHER HE'S PENT TWELVE MINUTES ON THE PICKET LINE ACCORDING TO THE FREE BEACON WITH THOSE AUTOR WORKERS THAN HE HEADED DIRECTLY TO A FUN RAISER IN CALIFORNIA AT THE HOME OF A BILLIONAIRE COUPLE THAT FUNDS THE MOVEMENT TO ABOLISH POLICING SAY STAY THER FORLIKE TWELVE MINUTES GONE IMMEDIATELY MOVED OVER TO CALIFORNIA TO PICK UP SOME CHECKS FROM THE RICH LIBS SO SOLID STUFF THERE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES BY THE WAY THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO STAGNATES ACCORDING TO THE WALSTER JOURNAL THE AMOUNTS OF CASH THAT YOU HAS HOUSEHOLD PILED UP AFTER THE PANDEMIC STRUCK HAS SHRUNK IN FACT YOUS HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS EXPLODED AFTER TH PH NDEMIC BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SIGNING PEOPLE CHECKS FOR NOTHING SO THE QUESTION NOW IS HOW MUCH CASH IS LAFT IF ANY ACCORDING TO TE WALSTR JOURNAL THE EASIEST WAY TO SEE WHAT HAPPENE TO SAVINGS IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC IS TO LOOK AT THE PERSONAL SAVINGS RATE MESSURING THE SHERE OF AFTERTAX INCOME THAT DOESN'T GET SPENT IN EIPRIL TWENTY TWENTY IT WAS THIRTY THREE POINT EIGHT PER CENT COMPARE TO EIGHT POINT EIGHT PER CENT OVER THE COURSE OF TWENTY NINETEEN IS STATE ELEVATED THOUGOUT TWENTY TWENTY AND MOST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE LAST YERE IS JUST THREE POINT FIVE PER CENT THIS HERE IT IS FOUR POINT THREE PER CENT AGAIN THAT IS WAG TOO LOW SO ONE WAY THAT ECONOMISTS HAVE TRIED TO FIGR OW MUCH EXCESS SAVINGS ARE ON THOSE HOUSEHOLD BALLANCE SHEETS IS BASICALLY TO AD UP ALL THE AFTERTAX INCOME THAT DIDN'T GET SPEN SINCE THE PANDEMICKET ONE AND MOR PESSIMISTIC TAKES OUT THERE IS FROM THE FEDERAL RESEARCHERS AFT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO THEY CALCULATE THAT EXCESS SAVINGS PEAPED ABOUT TWO POINT ONE STRILLION DOLLARS AND AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND NINETY BILLION DOLLARS REMAIN PUTTNG THE ON PASE TO BE COMPLETELY DEPLETED IN THE CURREN QUARTER IN OTHER WORDS ALL THOSE SAVINGS THAT PEOPLE HAD SAVED UP WE BURN THROUGH IT IT'S PRETTY MUCH GONE AND NOW THE FED RATE HEIGHTS OUR HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S WALLETS ACCORDING TO THE LALSTR JOURNAL  CONSUMERS IN THE MARKET FOR LOANES TO BUY HOMES AND CARS ARE DISCOVERING THAT BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVES RATE INCREASES THEIRE MONEY GETS THEM A LOT LAST THAN WOULD HAVE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO MEANWHILE THOSE WITH CRATICARDS AND OTHER LOANES THAE CARRY RATES PEG TO BROADER BENCH MARKS OUR FINDING THEY GUT WAY WAY WAY MORE EXPENSIVE BARRR SHOPPING FROM MORTGAGES OR AUTO LONES ARE EXPERIENCING STICK AR SHOCK THIRTY YEAR FIX TRAGHT MORTGAGES AR ROUND SEVEN PER CENT THAT'S UP FROM THREE PER CENTUES TO COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THIS WHY THEIR STICKINESS IN THE REALSDAY MARK AND NOBODY CAN SELL IN ORDERTO BUY AGAIN CAUSEYOU'RE NOC IN TA SELLIUR HOUSE  EVEN IF YOU MADE MONEY ON YOUR HOUSE CA TEN AF TO END WA SEVEN PER CENT MORTGANE BYING A HOME OR CARA NOW S COMPLETELY ON AFFORTABLE FOR THE TYPICAL AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD THESE YOU'RE MIXING THE HIGHER BARROWIN COST OF THE HIGH PRICES THAT MARKSANDY CHEEF ECONOMIST AND MOODI'S ANOLYTICS THE ESTIMATES THE TYPICAL AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD THE NED USE FORTY TWO WEEKS OF INCOMES BUY A NEW CAR UP FROM THIRTY THREE WEEKS THREE YEARS AGO THE NATIONAL ASOCIATION OF REALTERS CALCULATES THE TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY CAN NOT AFFORD TO BUY A MEDIAN PRICE HOME ANDTHEN YOU WONDER BY AMERICANS ARE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY THIS WOULD BE THE REASON MEANWHILE THE BI ANDMINISTRATION DOING ITS BEST TO MAKE LIKE EVEN MORE UNLIVABLE IS HAVING THE FT C SU AMAZON SO AMAZON WHICH IS THE CHEAPEST AND EASIEST WAY FOR PEOPLE TO GET PRODUCT IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW IS NOW BEING SUED BY LENA CON WHO IS A WILD LEFTE AT THE HEAD OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SHE IS TRYING TO SUE AMAZON ON THE THEORY THAT THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY A MONOPOLY AND USING MONOPOLY POWERS TO EN RICHART SO NOW THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT THEIRE TWO THEORIES O MONOPOLY ONE IS YOU OWN TO LARGER PER CENTAGE OF THE MARKET THE SECOND IS THAT 'S HARMON CONSUMERS NAME THE WAY IN WHICH AMAZON AS HARMON CONSUMERS THEY'RE BRINGING YOU PRODUCTS CHEAPER AND FASTER THAN ANY COMPANY ON PLANTED EARTH BRAHT NOW THE EFTY SEE IS GOING AFTER THEM ANYWAY WHY BECAUSE AGAIN A BUNCH OF POLITICAL ALLIES OF JO BYDON LEFT EES THEY THEY DON'T LIKE AMAZON IT IS TOO BIG AN THEY WAN TO BREAK IT UP THAT IS WHERE THE BY ANDEMINISTRATION IS RIGHT NOW AND THEN YOU WONDER WHY THE TUDE IS SO WILDLY ON POPULAR WHILE THAT WOULD BE THE REASON MORE ON THAT

THORTY PER CENTS ON ALTRED STORE SELECTIONS AND TWENTY EIGHT PER CENTS HAD CLOSED THE LOCATION AS OF CRIME OF VIOLENCS AN THAT IS ALL BECUSE O THE BLACKLIVES MANTER MOVEMENT AND THE AFTERMATH AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES IN DORSEMENT OF LAWLESS POLICY ALL A CROSS AMERICAS MAJOR CITIES THEN THESE BUSINESS LEAVE AND THEN IT IS THE BUSINESS AS ACCUSED OF RACISM BECAUSE THEY'RE LEAVING PREDOMINENTLY MINORITY AREAS WHERE THE CRIMERATES ARE HIGHEST THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THEN OF COURSE IT'S CAPITALISM THEY HEX BLAINMED NOT THE LAWLESSNESS THAT HAS BEEN PROMOTED BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEANWHILE THE ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE COMING FAST AND FURIOUS AND TWO FORMS OF ATTACK THEY'RE THE LEGAL ATTACKS THAN THERE'S ARE THE PUBLICITY ATTACKS OR THE LEGAL ATTACKS ONE OFTHE STUPIDEST LEGAL ATTACKS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THIS RIDICULOUS LAWSUIT BY LETITIA JAMES WHO IS THE ATTERNY GENERAL IN NEW YORK WHO CAME INT OFF IS PLEDGING TO GET DONAL TRUMP AND THEN FILED NOTE CRIMINAL TRARGES AGAINST ON TRUMP ISH CONFINE ANYTHING SOINSTADG UFIL THES CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION FOR FRAUD WHICH WAS ABSURD SHOSE BASICALLY ALLEGING THAT THEY INFLATED THEIR ASSATS AND AND THEI'R WORTH IN ORDER TO GET PARTICULAR LONE DEALS THE PROBLEM IS THE LONE COMPANIES SHOULD BE ONE SUING THE WISELY TISSUE JAMES SO IF THE LONE COMPANY DOESN'T LIKE THE LONE THAT A CUT WITH TRUMP AND THEY THINK HE WAS FRAUGULENT ABOUT IT THEY COULD TO HIM BUT THE'RE NOT SUING HIMS WHEN SETTLEET LETITIA JAMESUS WHILE NOW I JUDGE AS RULED THE TRUMP COMMITTED FRAUD FOR YEARS WHILE BUILDING THE REAL STAND UMPIRE THE CATIPUL TO HIM TO FAME AN THE WHITEHOUSE AND YOU ORDERED FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENTS COMPANIES REMOVED FROM HIS CONTROL AND ISOLVES JUDGE ARTHOR ANGARON RULING AN A CIVIL LAWS WHO BROUGHT BY THE YORK ATTORNY GENERAL ITTISTU JAMES FOUND THAT TRUMPET IS COMPANY TO SEE BANKS IN SURERS AND OTHERS BY MASSIVELY OVERVALUING HIS ASSETS AND EXAGGERATIG HIS NOTWORTH ON PAPER WORK USED IN MAKING DEALS AND SECURING LONS HE THEN U ORDER THAT FROME FROMS BUSINESS LICENCES BE RECENDED AS PUNISHMENT MAKING AN IMPOSSIBLE OR DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO BUSINESS IN NEW YORK THIS IS RIDICULOUS HONESTLY IT IT'S IT'S JUST IT'S RIDICULOUS APPARENTLY THE ALLEGE THAT TRUMP HAS CUMPANY AND KIGSACUTIVES REPEATEDLY LIED ABOUT HIS RICHES ON HIS ANUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REAPING REWARDS SUCH AS FAVORABLE LONE TURMS AND LOWER INSURANCE CAUST THOSE TACTICS CROSSED THE LINE AND VIOLATED THE LAW THE JUDGE SAID RE JECTIN TRUMPS CONTENTION THAT IT IS CLAIMER ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ABSOLVED HIM OF ANY WRON WRONG DOING SO HERE IS THE PROBLEM I MEAN WHO EXACTLY DID HE DEFRAUD AND IF SHE DEFRAUDED THE GOVERNMENTION THEY WOELD RING CRIMINAL CHARGES NOT CIVIL CHARGES ON ON ALL OF THIS SORT OF STUFF ENGAROM FOUND FOR EXAMPLE THE TRUMP CONSISTENTLY OVER VALUED MARALAGO IN FLATING ITS VALUE ON ONE FINANCIAL STATEMENT BY AS MUCH AS TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED PER SENT THE TRURGE ALSOR  BE TRUMP FOR LONG ABOUT THE SIZE OF HIS MAN HAT AN APARTMENT THIS IS LIKE THIS IS SUPER WEEK TY IES GAN HAVING IMPAC DON TRUMP ABSOLLY NOT GODJUS CAN GO O SO HE'S JUST SUPER RICH NOT SUPERDUPERDUPER RICH MEANWHILE THE MEDIA ARGOGUE OVER THE LATEST TO TELL ALL FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION EVERY SO OFTEN A MEMBER THE TRUMPIN INSTRECTION LEAVES GET SWEET GIG OVER IT SEAN END BY TALKING ABOUT ALL THE JUICY STUFF THAT HAPPENE DURING TRUMPS PRESIDENCY THE LATES BOM SHELL THROW WHER IS CASSITY HUTCHENSON NOW FAR BE IT FOR ME TO A DENY CASITY HUTCHENSON'S TRUTHFULNESS BUT I HAVE SOME DOUBTS THE REA

TESTIFIED THAT TRUMP ASSAULTED SECRE TURVICATINS AND LUNGE FOR THE WHEEL OF THE BEASTS ON JANUARY SIX THE MEMBER THIS ONE THAT HE'S LIKE I LIN TO GO TO THE CABITAL LET BE GOT THE CAPLA AND THEN IN TURNS OUT THAT EVERYBODY IN THE CARAS LIKE NOT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND THEN SHE ALLSO TESTIFIED THAT FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL PAT TIBOLONY PERSONALLY WARNED HER NOT TO ALLOWED TRUMP TO GO TO THE CAPITAL OR WERE WE'RE GOING TO GET CHARGE WITH EVERY CRIME IN IM AGHONABLE THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT SIPOLONI WAS NOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN HUTCHENS IN CLAMBUWAS SHE TESTIFIED THAT SHE WAS PERSONALLY HAND RITTEN NOTE AT THE DIRECTION OF BARKMEADOWS BUT I TURNS OUT THAT WAS TE FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LAWYER AR KURSEMAN WE SAID THAT HE HAD WRITTEN IN PARTICULAR NOTE HUTCHENSON TESTIFIED THAT THE FORMER SENIOR JUSTICE PARBEN OFFICIAL JUFF CLARK STRATEGIZED WITH RUT JULIANI ANDTHE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO OBJECT TO THE ELECTION BUT THOSE WO NEVER MET EACH OTHER SHE THEN CONTINUED TO

JANUARY SIX SHE SAID THAT J SIX COMMITTEE WAS PHONY AND BS AND BEG TRUMP OFFICIALS FOR FINANCIAL SSISTENCE AFTER SH WAS SOPENA BY THE COMITTEE THEN SHE DIDN'T RECEIVE THE FINANCIAL SISTANCE AND TEN

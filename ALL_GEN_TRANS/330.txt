HIM I WAS ACTING INVALBED TO ONE OF THOSE TABLOY STORIES MINE INVOLVING A LANDLORD AND HIRED CONTRACT KILLERS TO MURDER'S BROTHE IN LAW AND THEN GETS RATTED OUT BY THE SUPER THERE WAS A PECULIAR PAUS ON THE FOUND THAN MOSCOW SAID ALLAN STERN LEST NINETY NINTH STREET OM THE GOD WHO PUT HIM BEHIND BARS  RIGHT AWAY OF COURSE WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT BOB I TOLD HIM THE LIGHTBULB STORY MOSCOW HAWD A GOOD LAUGH AND THEN I WENT ON AND THE WAY WE RESIDENCE OF NINETY NINE STREET CAN DO AND FINALLY GOT TO THE ONE ABOUT BOB CLAIMING THAT HE HAD A SPECIAL EXEMPTION FROM THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION AND

OF THE MILITARY POLICE HERE'S JOHN MOSCOW DESCRIBING BOB'S TESTIMONY ON THE WITNESS STAND AND WHAT WAS YOUR JOB MY JOB WAS TO LOCATE ANTARROGATE N EXT ICUTE POLITICALLY UNELIABLE PERSONS GET OUT OF YEAR O BOB HAD BEEN IN THE DEATH SQUOT IN BRAZIL AND HE WAS ASKED DO YOU KILL ANY PEOPLE YTHERE YES MORE THAN ONE YES WAS MORE THAN BI I DON'T KNOW WOUT HE MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW WELL IF YOU SHOOD SOMEBODY AT LONG RANGE IN THE GO DOWN YOU DON'T KNOW THE DEBTER IT COMES THE POINT WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT BENEATH ALL THE FANCIFUL STORIES THAT USUALLY IS HE SUBSTANTIAL MAT OF TRUTH HE SAID HE CAMED NORTH FOR HIS HELL AND PERHAPS TO PROTECT HIS HEART BHE WAS THINKING THAT HIGH INPACT LED POISONING OAPPARENTLY A NUMBER O AND HE WAS IN HIS TWENTIES WHEN HE WAS IN THE DETHSQUAD AND HE REALIZED AT ONE POINT THAY SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN HIS SQUAD WERE DEAD A VIOLENT CUAUSES WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT EITHER WITH THERE BEING SUICIDLE IND THE RISKS THEY TOOK OR BOM WITH SOMEBODY HAVING A LIST OF THE NAMES WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED SOME ONE WHOSE RELATIVES HAD BEEN THIS HANDLE SO HE DECIDED THAT LEAVING WAS GOOD FOR HIS HEALTH ANALL THOSE CRAZY BOB STORIES WE SWAB FOR YEARS WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE TRUTH ABOUT BOB WOULD BE JUST AS CRAZY THE CORDING TO MOSCOW NOT ONLY HAD BOB BEEN IN A DESQUAD BUT HE HAD BEEN A KEE FIGURE IN THE MURDER OF ALLAN'S BROTHER IN LAW BOB WAS CRUCIAL AND SECURING THE TALENTS OF THE TWO HITMEN NAMED SAMMY FEET AN CRAZY JOE AND ACCORDING TO THE COURT DOCUMENTS BOB WAS IN THE BOILER ROOM WITH SOME OF HIS CREW WHEN NEWS OF THE HIT CAME DOWN THEY CELEBRATED WITH MARTINIAN ROSY AND THINGS REALLY GOT GOING WHEN A PORTABLE RADIO JUST HAPPENED TO FELT OUT THAT QUEEN SONG YOU KNOW THE ONE AN N ON BO TE DEATH AN  ON   ON NO ON BAT TE DETDAT THE HIT WAS JUST ONE OF NUMEROUS CRIMES BRILLIANT CRIMES REALY THAT BOB AND ALLEN PULLED OFF FROM THAT LITTLE OFFICE THE TURNS OUT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO CRIME BOB WAS INCREDIBLY CONPIDENT HE AND ALEN SET UP DUMBY CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES THEY DEFRAUDED THE STATE WITH COUNTERFEIT CHARGES TO FORCE OUT ONE TENENT THEY REWIRED THE ELECTRICAL OUTLETS TO HIGH VOLTAGE LINES TO FRY ALL THE APARTMENT APPLIANCES MY FAVORITE WAS THEIR NATURAL GASCAM THEY PUT FAT CONES OUT ON THE STREET AND ACTUALLY JACK HAMMERED THROUGH THE ASCALT TO A WORKING GASMARN THEY BUY PASSED THE METERS AND IN TIME ELIMINATED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUS AND BOWERS OF ALLEN'S GASCWS ON TOP OF ALL THIS BOB HELP THE PROSECUTION SNARE ALLEN BOB TAPPED ALLEN'S PHONES BOB WORE A WIRE AND IN COURT TRANSCRIPTS ALLAN COMMONLY WAYS THE RELATIVE MERITS OF BUYING OFF SOME PEOPLEW FIRST AS HAVING THEM KILLED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY COMES ACROSS WHEN YOU TALK TO MOSCOW JUST HOW WRONG ALL OF US WERE AT SIZING UP BOB AND ALLEN WHEN WE HAD TWENTY TWO HUNDRED HOMICIDES IN NEW YORK AS SUPPOSED TO FEWER THAN FIVE HUNDRED WHAT WERE ON FOR THIS YEAR YOU HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT KILLING PEOPLE THERE WAS A CERTAIN RATIONALITY AND COLD BLOODEDNESS ABOUT THIS MURDER THAT WAS JUST PLAIN DIFFERENT I JUST BOB TESTIFIED UNDER OATH AT TRIAL I WATCHED HIM WHEN HE WAS BEING CROSS EXAMINED AND I OMTHING ILL EVER FORGET DEFENSE COUNCEL ASKED HIM TI DOU TORTURE MEN OR WOMEN AND HE SAID MY SPECIALTY WAS MEN AND THE WAY HE SAID IT MY BLOODFELT THAT TEN DEGREES COLDER AND THERE WAS JUST ABSOLUTE ON THE THE COURT ROOM EVERYONE WAS PERSUADED THAT HE MEANT SO HOW DID BOB FORMER BRAZILIAN DESQUAT OFFICER RAT OUT ALLEN BOB ITHINK O OLD TIPS TO REPORT THE MURDER TIPS RIGHT WE LIKE THE ONE EIGHT UNDREDNUMBER WHAT THE LOCAL CRIME REPORTING IT SEAVEN TIPS SOTEVER YET SO HE HE CALLS THAT AND THEN HE GOES AND MAK MAKES AN APPOINTMENT AND MEETS WIT THE MAJOR CASE SQUAD WHAT BHUT DROVE HIM TO TURN ALLAN IN ALLAN AND HIS FAMILY HAD DISGUSSED SELLING THE BUILDING AND MOVING TO FLORIDA AND IN THE COURSE OF THAT ALLAN AD DISGUSSED HAVING THE PRESIDENT IN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE TENANT'S ASSOCIATION MURDERED AND BOB FIGURED THAT ALLAN WAS

STRIKE THAT WAS GOING TO BE PUT TOGETHER IN MY BUILDING AND I WAS THE TENANT LEADER OF THAT I MEAN WAS THAT THE REN PROBLEM THAT ALLAN WAS A UPSET ABOUT WAS THOAS ANOTHER RENSTRIG SO SO ALLAN MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED TO GET ME WACKED ULTIMATELY BOB WHEN INTO THE POLICE STATION AND ADMITTED HIS OWN ROLE IN A MURDER AND THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO PRISON BECAUSE HIS PERCEPTION AT THE TIME WAS THAT ALLAN WOULD CAUSE THESE MURDERS TO TAKE PLACE AND SO HE PROTECTED HIMSELF BY WRITTING ALAN AT FIRST SO BOB TURNING STATES EVIDENCE BASICALLY SAVE MY LIFE OR THE LIFE OF THIEUTENANT ORGANIZERS THAT WAS BOBSTORT MMO M I FOUND BOB I REACED HIM ON THE PHONE AND WE HAD A NICE CHAT HE REMEMBERS ME AS THE TALL BLONGUY ON THE FIRST FLOR HE WANTED TO TALK TO ME FOR THE STORY BUT HIS LAWYER TOLD HIM NOT TO

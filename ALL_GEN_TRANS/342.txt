AFRICAN AMERICANS STILL GET A WARM RECEPTION HERE JONAT SAID YES I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS ALL I KNOWS THAT IT FEELS VERY DIFFERENT TO BE AROUND FRENCH WHITE PEOPLE THEN AMERICAN WHITE PEOPLE JUST NOW I

AND WHEN HE CAME TO PARIS HE FELT IT SLIP OFF HIS BACK DID YOU HAVE DI YOU OT THE CONTOFEELING YET I REALLY HAVE TO SAY THAT I HAVE FELT THAT WAY EVER SINCE I GOT HERE AND 'S A LOT OF MY FRIENDS SAYING O WHY YOU LIVING THERE IN FACT A FREND OF MINIMENT TO LOSCHOO IT HE SAID WHAT IS IT ABOUT SPEAKING FRENCH THAT MAKES WHITE PEOPLE NOT RACES HE WHO ISN' VERY SCEPTICAL BUT IT REALLY IT GOES BEYOND THAT IT'S IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE FEEL FREE OF THE BURDEN OF RACE BECAUSE WE'RE STILL BLACK I STILL EXPERIENCE MYSELF AS BLACKET'S JUST IT THAT'S NOT LIKE THE CENTRE OF MY IDENTITY IT'S NOT THE FIRST THING PEOPLE RELATE TO WHEN I MEET THEM HERE JANA FIRST CAME TO PARIS AN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND MOVED HERE IN NINETY FIVE SHE'S A LAWYER IN THE FRENCH OFFICE OF THE BING AMERICAN COMPANY SHE GROW UP IN THE PUBLIC HOUSE IN PROJECTS IN BROOKLIN WORKED AWAY INTO VASSRA COLLEGE AND ONDER GRADUATE SCHOOL MOSSCEL IN LOOK GOLOT A PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE JUMP FROM VERY POOR CRIMBRED NEIGHBOURHOOD INTO THE COLLEGE EDUCATED UPPERMIDDLE CLASS SHE FELT LIKE SHE DIDN'TREALLY FITTED ANYWHERE NOT WITH FAMILY IND FRIENDS IN THE CROJECTS WH WERE SHOOTING HEROINE BARELY SURVIVING NOT WITH THE BLACK SDUDENT SHE MET IN COLLEGE I THOUGHT THEY WERE BOURGEOIS SOUTHERN BELLS I DIDN'T WANT TO BE ANY THING LIKE THEM AN THEY AN' WONE TO BE LIKE MEITHER THEY THOUGHT I WAS TRASSH I WAS PROJECT TRASSH I THOUGHT THEY WERE LIKE THEY PUT THE BE IN BUGY AND SO I GRAPPLED A LOT WITH THAT THE RACIAL IDENTITY LIKE WHAT WOULD MY POSTURE BE ON FROM THE PROJECTS BUT YOU PEOPLE SAY I TALK LIKE A WHITE GIRL AND HEN THE WHITE GIRLS ARE LIKE I YOUR SO PROJECT AND THEN WHEN I GOT HERE NO THIT MATTER BECAUSE IF I SPOKE THREE WORDS O FRENCH THAT MADE SENSE PEOPLE LIKE ME AN TEY CELEBRATED ME SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TALKING LIKE A WIKE GIRL OR PROJECT GIRL OR ANYTHING OT WAS AN INCREDIBLE RELIEF THE CENTRAL CONFLICT OF HER LIFE SUDDENLY VANISHED IN PARIS ALL THE DISTINCTIONS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF WHIKE PERSEN SHE SHOULD BE THEY WERE ALL MOOT IF I THE MOST DISTINGUISHING FACT ABOUT HAND IT WAS NOT THAT SHE WAS BLACK IT WAS THA SHE WAS AN AMERICA WHICH SURPRISED HER I ASSOCIATED THE WORD AMERICAN WIS YOU KNOW WHITE GEYES WITH FLAGS ON THEIR LAWNS WHO DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE ME AND PEOPLE WOULD CALL ME AMERICAN NI'D SOUND NOT AMERICAN A'M BLACK AND THESE WERE LIKE BLACK FRENCH PEOPLE I LIKE YOU ARE SO AMERICAN AND THEY I REMEMBER THESE FRENCH WEST INDIAN FRIENDS OF MIND THIS ONE IN PARTICLAR FROM MARTINIQUE WAS SAYING YOU EVEN WALK LIKE AN AMERICA A LIK WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DOES AN AMERICAN WALK LIKE AND SHE SAID THEY KICK THEIR LEGS WHEN THEY WALK THAT KICK THEIR LEGS FORWARD I DON'T KNOW I TELL MY FRENDS CAUSE O I WAS IN BROOK THEN JUST IM A FEW WEEKS AGO AN THIS WOMAN WHO NEVER BEEN TO EUROPE WAS SAYING SO WHAT'S IT LIKE AND IN FRANCE ARE THEY LIKE WAN OTHER PEOPLE LIKE OW THEY PREJUDICE I SAID NO THEY LIKE US IT'S LIKE INCREDIBLE A COUNTRY FULL OF WHITE PEOPLE AND THEY LIKE US BUT IT'S STILL IT'S A DIFFICULT THING BECAUSE THEY LIKE US BUT THEY DON'T LIKE OTHER PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE US AND THAT SORT OF THE FRENCH PARADOT PARIS OF COURSE HAS ITS OWN HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE SUBURBS SURROUND THE CITY NOW WITH GENERATIONS OF AFRICANS WHO WERE BORN ON FRENCH SOIL IF FAY DROBED DISCRIMINATION HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND THEY'RE NOT WELL RECEIVE THEY'RE NOT WELCOME THAN THEY ARE FRENCH AND SO IN A WAY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE IN A VERY BAZAARE POSITION IT'S ALMOST LIKE BEING AN HONORARY WHITE AN APARTIE SOUTH AFRICA AND I NOTICE THAT YOU NOW AS MY FRENCH GOT BETTER AND BETTER THAT SOMETIMES I WASN'T AS WELL RECEIVED AS I WOULD BE IF I PLAYED UP MY AMERICAN ACCENT WHEN FRENCH PEOPLE IF I WALKING TO A SHOP AND PEOPLE WOULD THINK I WAS JUST NO'T BASETO THO I SAY JUST ANOTHER ALL JUST LIKE ONE OF THEIR OWN LIKE FROM MARTINIQUE OR GUADLO IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME RECEPTION IF I LIKE CAME ON WITH A VERY HEAVY AMERICAN ACTS N OR EVEN SPOKE ENGLISH I I WOULD THE YO YOU TI I TI HAT YOU ERE AN AFRICAN WILE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHILL IN THE AIR MIKE A KNOW YES WHEN I HELP YOU NOT SO MUCH OH WAS TAT TI MERELY GIN OH I LOVE OB I LOVE TO SPEAK ENGLISH SO IT'S IT'S VERY VIZAAR IT'S A IT'S A HARD THING TO RECONCILE BECAUSE I MEAN GOOD FEELING IS GOOD FEELING AND WHEN SOME ONE RECEIVES YOU AND MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD YOU IT'S A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE  WHEN WHEN YOU'RE IN A SHOP AND I YIL TE TI CHILLIN THE AR AND THEY THINK OF YOU AS AN AFRICAN WILL YOU ACTUALLY PAY UP YOUR AMERICAN ACCA WELL WHAT HAPPENED WAS I STARTED O EXPERIENCING THAT AND SO I ACTUALLY ADJUSTED MY MY SPEECH SO THAT YOU KNOW AT LEAST I WOULD GET THE BENEFIT OH LIKE B I MEAN I'M HERE IN THIS GOUNTRY I WANT TO GET THE BENEFIT OF BEING AN AFRICAN AMERICAN SO INSTEAD OF LIKE WALKING AND A WE MADAME OGMENT TELES I SHE SAW I'D SAY WE A SIVOUPLAESCOVOUPUVE ME DE O MAYBE MABE I CERDN DO THAT AT AT WORKS YENIT WCS  A FRIEND OF JANATS IS SUGGESTED TO HER THAN MAY BE PARISIANS PREFERRED BLACK PEOPLE

BETOWIN THE PROJECTS AND WORD OF TE ASPIRING UP HER MITTAL CLASS IRE'S A STRUGGLE AT ER FIRST YOURE ADVASSER FOR INSTANCE SHE FELT SO OUT OF PLACE THAT SHE STARTED TAKING THE TRAIN DOWN TO NEW YORK CITY TO SCORE HEROINE THINK SHE NEVER EVEN DONE WHEN SHE LIVED IN THE PROJECTS JUST GOT TICKED TOUT A SCHOOL FOR THAT THERES AS IF THE FURTHER THAT SHE TRAVELLED INTO THE WORLD OF COLLEGE THE MORE THE PROJECT SIDE OF HER PERSONALITY WAS COMPELLED TO EXPRESS ITSELF SOMEHOW SHED PICTS HERSELF A SOMEBODY WAS DEPRESSED AND IN BATTLE AND SO TOLOSS FOR YEARS AND THE MOST STRIKING THING ABOUT MEETING HER IF YOU READ THE BOOK IS HOW COMLETELY HAPPY SHE SEEMS TO DAY SHE'S ONE OF THE HAPPIES SEEMING PEOPLE I EVER MET JUST RELAXED AND FUNNY AND AT EASE AND HER FEELING ABOUT FRANCE THE COUNTRY WITH THIS

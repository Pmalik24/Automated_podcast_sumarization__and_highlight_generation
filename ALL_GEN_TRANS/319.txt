ON STAGE BY THE PERSON THAT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO PLEASE WELCOME COMMEDIAN MY PROBIGOYO VETY EASY FOLLOWING A MUSICAL IA I THINK THAT MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT A BEING MARRIED IS ACTUALLY THAT YOU CAN SHARE JOKES A WITH YOUR A WIFE OR HUSBAND BETTER FUNNY TO YOU AND THAT PERSON AND NO ONE ELSE OTHER THAN MAY BE YOUR CAT A CRUS WHEN YOU HAVE A CAT YOUR BAROMETER FOR HUMOR OUT THE WINDOW A LASSOMER MY WIFE NI WHEN ON TRIP TO MASSACHUSETTS AND AND I CALLED IT CATSACHUSETTS WHICH IS NOT FUNNY BUT IN OUR HOUSE WAS THE JOKEER ALI 'RE GOING THE CATS AS SHOSIS MY WIFE IS I  I WAS A  CAT WAS A EVERYONE LOVES A GOOD PUN WHEN YOU HAVE A CAT AND SO SO WE TRIED TO CATCH THE CHUSETTS AND WHEN WE ARRIVE MY WIFE HAS A HEADACHE AND SHE ASKED ME IF I WILL ACCLAMATE IVAN THAT'S HER CAT TO THE BEDROOM CAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST PUT IT INDER A CAT INTO A HOUSE COULDS HILL EXPLOWED AND SO I BRINGIIN H BEDROOM BUT IM SO TIRED FROM THE DRIVE THAT I FALL SLEEP WHICH IS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN NOT DO WHEN ACCLAMATIN IN INTER A CAT TO A HOUSE SINCE I WAKE IM AN HOUR LATER IVAN IS GONE HE GOT OUT AND NOW RUNNING ROUND THE HOUSE WHEN IKE AN YON MY CATS CAN EXPLOWED I WAKE UP MY WIFE I SIT CLO HER NAMES JAN I SAY

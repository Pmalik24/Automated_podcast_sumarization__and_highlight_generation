SOME PEOPLE THEY READ THIS OLD STORIES FROM THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE ILIAD AND THE ODYSSY THEY READ HE IN SCHOOL WHEN IT JUST GETS TO THEM ONE OF THE PRODUCERS HERE AT ARSHOU EMMANUAL WAS LIKE THAT I LEVE THE LIKE HEROS HECTOR I THOUGHT AGAMAMNON WAT SUCH A DEVA A I LOVE THE YED WE HAD TO TRANSLATED IN MY LATIN CLASS AND IN ADDITION TO LIKE TRANSLATING PASSAGES I DECIDED TO MAKE LIKE A NINE BY THREE FOOT MURAL OUT OF MAGAZINE PAPER DEPICTING AEUSES LIKE JERNEY INTO HELL WHEN WHEN YOU SAY MAGAZINE PAPER HO MANE YOUR CUTTING GLETTERS AT OF A MAGAZINE AGAZI  I I I I I WAS METICULOUSLY RIPPING TEENY PIECES OF DIFFERENT COLOURS OF MAGAZINE PAPER AND MAKING LIKE AMOSAIC BEISY A AND I REMEMBER THAT JAILO WAS ON THE MURLE FOR SOME REASON ES WARING LIKE A WHITE DRESS THAT KIND OF CREAT SO IS I GA TOGA YEAE AS IF SHE GOT TO BE DIED OUT AND HOW WHEN I TEACH YOUR SIN TO TWENTY PAGE RESEARCH PAPER ON ANY  SUBJECT IN THE WORLD LIKE THEY CULD DO ANYTHING AT ALL I WAS OBVIES TO EMMANUAL WHAT TO DO THE STORY OF TROY THE PLACE OF THE TRORGAN MORE HAPPEN THE WALLD CITY THAT THEY PULLED THE TRORGAN HORSE IN TO AND IN DOING RESEARCH FOR THIS PROJECT I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE KY NAME HINIC SCHLEYMEN HINDRIC SHLEAMI A MAN WHO ALSO READ THOSE OLD STORIES  GOT OBSESSED A HE'S BORN IN GERMANY IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SE'S LIKE A BUSINESS MAN A MERCHANT AND RUSSIA AND THEN HE LIKE MOVED TO CALIFORNIA DER IN THE GOLD RUSH AND OPEN A BANK IT SAID THAT HE WOULD CARRY AROUND LIKE COPIES OF HOMER A AND HE TAUGHT HIMSELF ANCIENT GREAT LIKE IN TWO YEARS HE TAUGHT HIMSELF ANCIENT GREEK WHICH IS INSANE TO ME A JUST SO HE COULD LIKE READ THE BOOKS AND LIKE THE LANGUAGE OF ORUNE ANDYWAY BUT BASELY HE LOK A MASSES AS HUGE FORTUNE AND ONCE HE HAS HIS FORTUNE HE DECIDES THAT HE'S GOING TO FINE TROY AT THE TIME PEOPLE WEREN'T SURE IF IT WAS A REAL PLACE ARE JUST LIKE A A STORY LIKE A LANTIS AND A AND A THIS KIND OF A DOM QUESTION BUT IN THAT PERIOD DID ARCHAEOOGIST EVEN EXIST LIKE WAS TAT EVEN A JOB YE NOT REALLIA JOB A IT'S LIKE A VERY NEW FIELD THI WHOLE IDEA OF DIGGING UP THE PASS AND SA THERE THERE ARE LIKE SORT OF HOBBYIST DAVLLING IN IT HIT HES HOBBIIS BY THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES TA FIGURED OUT FROM VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC CLUES AT HOMER GIVES IN THE TEXT ABOUT TROYS PROXIMATED TO THE DARDENALS AND MOUNT IDA THEY FEIGETAT WERE A LIKELY LOCATION FOR THE CITY MIGHT BE HIT WAS IN THE PLACE OF BE OW CALLED TURKEY AND AT THAT SPOT WAS KIND OF A BIG MOUND OF DIRT A SHLLYMAN GETS GOING SO HE STARTS TO DAY HE HIRIES DOZENS AND DOZENS OF WORKERS AND WHEN HE'S DIGGING HE STARTS TO FIND BASILY LIKE HES THESE LAYERS OF CITIES THAT ARE SO BUILT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER SO THEY BITS AF POTTERY AND LIKE FOUNDATIONS OF BUILDINGS WHEN A CITY BURNS TO THE GROUND THAT WE JUST BUILD ANOTHER CITY RATE ON TOP OF IT A BUT NONE OF THEM ARE WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR LIKE WHAT HE IS LOOKING FOR IS HE WANTS TO FIND BASILY LIKE GOLD SILVER AND BRONZE LIKE THAT'S THE THING HE THINKS IS GOING TO BE LIKE THE SIGNIFIER THAT THIS IS TROY BECAUSE HE'S THINKING OF YOU KNOW THIS TREASURE RICH CITY THAT HOMER DESCRIBES IN THE ILIAD AND HE'S ALSO THINKING THAT LIKE WELE IT'S GOT O BE FURTHER DOWN LIKE HAS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM RIHT LIKE TROYS GOIN TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PILL AND SO HE HEEPS DIGGING AND  KEEPS FINDING MORE AND MORE LAYERS WITH CITIES YES AND THEN HE GETS TO THE BOTTOM OF THESE PILES OF CITIES AND THAT'S WHERE HE FINDS IS TREASURE HE FINDS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR HE FINDS IS GOLD HE FINDS H SILVER HE FINDS BRONZE A HE CALLS IT PRIUMS TREASURE PRIUM BEING LIKE THE THE KING OF TROY IN THE ILIAD HBUT THERE'S NOTHING ONE IT THAT SAYS LIKE PRIUMS YOU HE A YOUTDA RIIAMS E ANGER SOMETAG NO CANO KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT IT HAS 'T HOVE HARD PROOF THERE IS TROY IT DOESN'T MIND RIT WHIC WOULD A E REALLY HELPED CAND AS ONE QUESTION YET DID HE FIND A HUGE WOULDN HORSE COUS THAT IT A NALT IT A NO HU TWAENT HORS WOULD WOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED AND O THES AR FINE W DID HI SHOW HIS TAT THE INADVERTAIN THINGS THAT HAPPENE WHEN YOU STRECT DIGGING AT THE PAST AND THIS IS THE POINT WHERE SCLEYMAN STOY GETS MORE COMPLICATED SHEMAN ANNOUNCES TO THE WORLD THAT HE'S FOUND THE CITY THAT HOMER WAS WRITING ABOUT HE'S FOUND TROY IT BCOMES INTERNATIONALLY FAMOUS BUT THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION IS IS THAT THE TROY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE WITH ALL THIS TREASURE AND ALL THIS COLD THAT ACTUALLY WAS NOT TROY IT WAS NOT HOMERS TROY AT LEAST IT GHOT'S FROM THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE TROY WOULD HAVE EVEN HAPPENED THE TROY THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE CITIES THAT HE HAD JUST DUG THROUGH AND DESTROYED IN THE PROCESS OF DIGGING THROUGH IT SOUN NO THAT HE'S JUST DIGGING DOWN HE REACHES TROYS LIKE MANAA THIS HISN' IT THROWS IT ON THE SIDE IS LIKE DEBRIS YET THAT'S GARBAGE YET AND BASICALLY HE DESTROYED A BIG CHUNK OF THE ANCIENT CITY IN TRYING TO FIND THE CITY THE TROYE WAS LOOKING FOR ARCHEO JUS UNDERSTAND NOW WAS JUST THREE LAIRS DOWN AND HE DUG NINE LATERS DOWN SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT LIKE FOR ANY ARCHAEOLOGIST TO DAY WHO'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON THAT TROY KIND OF SCREWED THEM OVER I CALLED ONE OF THESE GUEES ON HIS NAME IS BRINE ROSE ND HE WAS A CODIRECTOR OF EXCAVATIONS AT TROY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS HE'S NOT A FAN OF SCHLEYMAN SO HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING SO THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE'VE LOST ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SPEED AND DIGGING WHEN I LOOK THROUGH HIS NOTE BOOKS HE'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE BUSNTIN BUILDING AND DEBRIE FOUND TO DAY DIST MANTLED NOW THAT DOESN'T TELL ME IF IT'S EUARLY BIDDLE LATE BUSNTEIN WHAT THE BUILDING LOOKED LIKE WAS MANY ROOMS WAS AT ONLY ONE ROOM WHAT DID HE FIND THERE WAS JUST DEBRIITHE IT WAS IN HIS WAY DEBRIS THAT WAS IN HIS WAY THAT SCHLEEMAN WOULD JUST DIG UP AND THROWIN A PILE ON THE SIDE YE SCHLEEM ON EXCAVATED EXTENSIVELY AND HE HAD TO PUT THE EARTH THAT HE REMOVED SOMEWHERE SCHLEEMON DUMPED ALL THE EARTH FROM HIS TRENCHES IN THE AREAS WERE I WANTED DIG AND PART OF THE REASON THAT HE WANTS TO DIG IN THAT AREA IS BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE WRITING THERE AN TOOK SCHEMAN IS NOT ME THAT VERY HARD YET BECAUSE THERE'S ALL THIS DIRT ALL THESE UPROOTED RUINS THAT ARE JUST ON TOP OF THAT AREA AND IT WOULD TAKE YEARS AND FRYIND SAYS TECHNOLOGY THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST NOW TO DIG IT UP WITHOUT DOING MORE DAMAGE SO YOU HAVE TWENTY METERS OF DUMP THROUGH WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO IN ORDER TO GET TO A DEPOSIT THAT MIGHT HAVE WRITING OF LATE BRONZA T DAY THAT SOMETHING AT LOVE TO BE ABLE TO BUT FOR NOW IT'S JUST TO MONUMENTAL AND UNDERTAKING TO DO IT O ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS ALWAYS KAND O BUT  ME ABOUT THE STORY IS THAT BEFORE SCHLEYMAN DIDE THEY ACTUALLY FIGURED OUT THAT HE WAS WRONG OH THEY DID YET BUT HE STILL REMEMBERD TO THIS DAY FOR DISCOVERING TROY AND ONE OF THE THINGS I REMEMBER FROM THAT PAPER I WRODE WAS THAT REALLY IT ENDED AP MAD AT HIM LAKE LIKE I WAS NOT AT HIM FOR LIKE YOU WUE GOING TO GO VITTED TROY AND HE MESTIT UP FASICALLY KIND OF BUT WHEN I TALKED WITH BRYAN ABOUT IT HE'S KIND OF ZE ABOUT IT I WOULD CERTAINLY EXPRESS FRUSTRATION WHICH SCHLEMON IN THE SAME WAY THAT AN ARCHAEOLOGIST DIGGING AT TROY IN A HUNDRED YEARS WOULD EXPRESS FRUSTRATION WITH ME OH I LIKE HIS ATTITUDE YE I MEAN I THINK WHEN OU'R AN ARCHAEOLOGIST YOU CIND A HAVE TO TAKE THE LONG VIEW HE KNOW YOU'RE WARE THAT PEOPLE ARE GON T COME AFTER YOU AND THEREN'T A NO MORE THAN YOU SO YOU'RE VERY WEARE OF YOUR OWN LIMITATIONS ND THAT'S ACTUALLY OR SO TODAY TO DAY ON A PROGRAMME WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE GOING AND BEING UP STUFF FROM THE PAS FULL OF

ARRIVED TOT ACK THREE OF OUR SHELL AT THREE THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BONE TIV CESTERBAM HAS THIS STORY ABOUT A MAN OBSESSED WITH A SINGLE BONE A BONE THAT IS INEXPLICABLY LARGE REARLY JUST DO BIG TO MAKE ANY SENSE OUT OF AT ALL IT WAS A FRAGMENT OF A BONE SO OLD HAD TURNED TO STONE THE MAN TRYING TO PUZZLE IT OUT WAS A NATURALIST AND PROFESSOR IN ENGLAND NAMED ROBERT PLOT HE WRITES ABOUT IT IN THIS BEAUTIFUL METICULOUS BOOK THE NATURAL HISTORY OF OXFORD SHIRE PUBLISHD IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE CURIOUS BONE HE WRITES WAS QUOTE DUG OUT OF A QUARRY IN THE PARISH OF CORNWELL GIVEN TO ME BY THE INGENIOUS SIR THOMAS PENNYSTON HE WRITES THAT IT SEEM TO BE SOME PART OF A THIGHBONE EXCEPT WEIGH TOO BIG IT MEASURED TWO FEET AND WEIGHED ALMOST TWENTY POUNDS THIS IS THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS AND NO ONE IN THE WORLD HAD A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR A BONE THAT BIG PLOT WRITES FOR ALMOST NINE PAGES IN HIS BOOK ABOUT THIS STRANGE BONE AND HE IS METHODICAL IN TRYING TO REASON OUT WHAT THE HECKET IS FIRST HE CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MAYBE IS NOT A BONE AT ALL BUT JUST SOME NATURAL ROCK FORMATION WHICH IS ADMIRABLE IT SO EASY TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS BUT THE MORE HE STUDIES IT IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE PART OF A COLOSSAL BONE HE WRITES THAT IT HAS THAT CAPITA PEMORRIS INFERIORA AND QUOTE THE SEAT OF THE STRONG LIGAMENT THAT RISES OUT OF THE THIGH GIVES SAFE PASSAGE TO THE VESSELS DESCENDING INTO THE LEG AND THEN INSIDE THE BONE THERE IS WHAT LOOKS LIKE MARROW HE CAN SEE THE MARROW PRESERVED INSIDE BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS IT FROM QUOTE IT WILL BE HARD TO FIND AN ANIMAL PROPORTIONABLE TO IT HE WRITES HE RUNS THROUGH THE POSSIBILITIES ELIMITATING THEM ONE BY ONE HORSE OXEN TOO SMALL HE CON SIDERS SOMETHING OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED TIT MAYBE THE BONE IS FROM AN ELEPHANT PERHAPS BROUGHT OVER DURING THE ROMAN INVASIONS BACKGROUND FIFTY EIGH D HE SPENDS TWO PAGES ON THIS POSSIBILITY BUT IT SEEMS UNLIKELY TO HIM HE'S CLEARLY READ THROGH LOTS OF HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS QUOTE SUTONIUS IN HIS LIFE WHERE HE IS VERY PARTICULAR CONCERNING THIS EXPEDITION INTO BRITAIN MENTIONS NO SUCH MATTER THERE WAS ONE ELEPHANT TIS TRUE HE WRITES SENT AS A PRESENT TO KING HENRY THE THIRD FROM THE KING OF FRANCE IN THE YEAR TWELVE FIFTY FIVE AND PERHAPS TWO OR THREE OTHER ELEPHANTS BROUGHT TO ENGLAND FOR SHOW SINCE THEN BUT QUOTE WHETHER IT BE LIKELY ANY OF THESE SHOULD BE BURIED AT CORNWELL LET THE READER JUDGE ALSO IF THE BONE IS FROM AN ELEPHANT HE WRITES WHERE ARE THE TUSKS FINALLY AS HE'S WRITING IT HE EXPLAINS THAT AN ACTUAL LIVE ELEPHANT COMES TO TOWN WHICH HE EXAMINES AND DESIDES NO ELEPHANT THIGHBONE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHAPE DEFINITELY NOT ELEPHANT AND HERE HE CAN FEEL IN STARTING TO PIECE THINGS TOGETHER HE'S ON THE EDGE OF SEEING THIS THING HE MENTIONS OTHER LARGE BONES AFTER THE GREAT FIRE IN LONDON IN SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX UNDER THE WRECKAGE OF SAINT MERRY WOOLL CHURCH QUOTE THERE AS FOUND A THIGHBONE NOW TO BE SEEN AT THE KING'SHEAD TAVERN IN GREENWICH AND KENT MUCH BIGGER AND LONGER THAN OURS AND ALSO PEOPLE HAD BEEN FINDING UNUSUALLY LARGE TEETH IN FACT PEOPLE HAD BEEN FINDING AN USUALLY LARGE BONES FOR CENTURIES THERE'S ONE ACCOUNT BY A CHINESE SCHOLAR FROM THE THREE HUNDREDS B C BUT NONE HAD A SATISFYING EXPLANATION HIS REMARKABLE READING ROBERT PLOT'S BOOK TO THINK HOW CLOSE HE WAS SUCH A STUNNING FACT ABOUT LIFE ON THIS PLANET BUT YOU CAN KNOW A LOT AND STILL NOT SEE SOMETIMES YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE HE JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITY OF IT TEVEN WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING THE THING IN YOUR HAND BY THE END OF TE SECTION OF THE BOOK PLOT HAS REASONE OUT THE ONE REMAINING POSSIBILITY THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES ANY SENSE TO HIM THE BONES THEY MUST HAVE COME FROM GIANTS PEOPLE JUST A LITTLE BIGGER WHICH I HAVE TO SAY T WAY MORE SENSIBLE THAN THE TRUTH   HVICESTABOU IS HE E COMEDITOR OF OUR PROGRAM ROBERT PLOT BIT IN SIXTEEN NINETY SIX HE PUT IN FIGURE AT THE HOL DAINUS OR THING ANOTHER NDRED YEARS BON POD PUZZLED IVE WAS LOST A LONG TIME AGO BUT FROM THE DRAWINGS SCIENTIS THINK IT IT WAS A MEGALASORIST THE GOOD AN CORNWALL SOME ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION YEARS BEFORE HIM ND YES FIOAT CORT RIVISION QUEST SO WE INTERSHORTEDAY WITH SOMEBODY WHO DUG UP BONES FROM HER PAST A THEN YEARS LATER WENT BACK TO THE SAME SIGHT TO DING THEM UP AGAIN SUSNBURTON EXPLAINED JALE'S HUSBAND DIED A FEW YEARS AGO THEY MET IN NINETEEN SEVENTY WHEN JALE WAS SIXTEEN AND HE WAS FORTY SEVEN AND IN SPITE OF THE AGE DIFFERENCE THEY WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT EACH OTHER FROM A START IT WAS A HAPPY MARRIAGE THAT'S ONE WAY TO TELL THE STORY HERE'S ANOTHER JALE'S HUSBAND DIED A FEW YEARS AGO THEY MET IN NINETEEN SEVENTY WHEN JALE WAS SIXTEEN AND HE WAS FORTY SEVEN SHE WAS HIS STUDENT AND ONE EVENING AFTER CLASS HE KISSED HER THEY STARTED SLEEPING TOGETHER HE MIGHT CALLMA PREDITOR OR SAY HE AMUSED HIS POWER BUT EVERYTHING TURNED OUT OQEY IT WAS A HAPPY MARIAGE JILLS A WRITER HER FULLAMOUS JILLS CEMENT AND YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS IN HER FORTIES SHE PUBLISHED A MEMOIR THAT TELD THE STORY THE FIRST WAY NOW SHE'S WRTING THAT STERY AGAIN AND CONSIDERING IT FROM THE SECOND ING NOT TO CORRECT THE RECORD SHE'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WROTE HER STORY THE WAY SHE DAY THE FIRST MEMOIR IS CALLED HALF A LIFE THE ONE SHE'S WRITING NOW AS CALLED THE OTHER HALF WHEN I WROTE HALF A LIFE RIGINALLY YEN I WROTE THIS THING FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART I WAS SUPPOSEDLY TELLING THE TRUTH WHICH I REALLY DEEPLY BELIEVED I WAS BUT WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE METO MOVEMENT IT WAS A KIND OF CATTALIST THAT MADE ME THINK WHAT IF I TOLD MY STORY AGAIN FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF ME BEING SIXTY SIX IN THE VANTAGE POINT OF THE WORLD HEAVING COMPLETELY CHANGED JILE NEW EXACTLY WHERE SHE WANTED TO START BY WRITING DOWN THE STORY OF THEIR FIRST KISS WHAT SHE WROTE ABOUT IT WHEN SHE WAS IN HER FORTIES IS NOT HOW SHE REMEMBERS IT TO DAY HERE'S WHAT SHE REMEMBERS TO DAY THE NIGHT OF THAT KISS JALE AND ARNOLD HER TEACHER WERE IN AN ART STUDIO IT WAS AN EVENING CLASS MOST OF THE OTHER STUDENTS WERE RETIRIES THE CLASS HAD ENDED AND JALE WAS ALONE WITH ARNOLD AND FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS SHE'D BEEN DOING THINGS LIKE SAYING I WISH YOU WERE OLDER AND YOU KNOW NOT MAKING SEXUAL ADVANCES BUT CERTAINLY MAKING ME AWHERE HE WAS ATTRACTED TO ME AND I WAS COMPLETELY ATTRACTED TO HIM AND ALL I DID WAS FAN ASSISE ABOUT HIM AND SO WE WENT INTO HIS STUDIO SUPPOSEDLY HE WAS GOING TO GIVE ME THE NAMES OF PEOPLE I WAS ABOUT TO DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL MOVED TO NEW YORK TO PIONARTIST AND HE WAS GOING TO GIVE ME THE NAMES OF OTHER ARTIST WHO WOULD BECOME MAY BE MENTOURS OR HIRE ME AS INASSISTENT AND AS WE GOT INTO THE ROOM I REMEMBER HE TOOK MY WRISSED AND PULLED ME TOWARDS HIM AND WE KISSED AND YOU KNOW I LOOK BACK AND I REALIZED I HADN'T WRITTEN IT THAT WAY  KAY I HAD WRITTEN IT AS IF I HAD BEEN TH SEXUAL GRESSOR COULD YOU GO AHEAD AND READ THAT HOW YOU DESCRIBED THE SCENE IN AP A LIFE ABSOLUTELY ON THE LAST NIGHT OF ART CLASS I DAWDLED IN THE HALL UNTIL THE OTHER STUDENTS WERE FINISHED HAS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE I SLIPPED BACK INTO THE CLASS ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND ME ARNOLD WAS LEANING AGAINST THA WINDOW FRAME ARMS FOLDED I SHOT YAWNING THIS TIME I APPROACHED HIM WITHOUT A HINT OF COINESS WITHOUT THE SPARK OF A BLUSH I AM BUTTON THE TALP THREE BUTTONS OF MY PESSANT BLOUSE CROSSED THE INKSPLATTERED FLOOR AND KISED HIM WHAT WHY DID YOU WRITE IT THAT WAY AND NIGHTLY NIGHTTE THINKS I DON'T KNOW I THINK I VIEWED MYSELF IS AND I I ALWAYS HAVE I VIEWED MYSELF AS SOMEONE WHO WAS ALWAYS IN CHARGE I NEVER FELT POWERLESS AND SO MAY BE A WAY OF ILLUSTRATING THAT WAS TO MAKE ME THE SEXUAL GRESSOR AT LEAST THIS FORUS TO KISS WENT BUT I I HAVE I DON'T HONESTLY KNOW I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I'M WRITING THIS WHOLE BOOK TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT SEEMED THE TRUTH THEN I WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT PURPOSELY POQEY IT DID SEEM THE TRUTH WHEN I WROTE IT NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHY IT SEEMED THE TRUTH THEAR IS WHAT INTERESS ME ONE REASON IT SEEMED LIKE THE TRUTH WAS THAT LATER WHEN JIL AND ARNOLD SLEPT TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE WAS THE ONE WHO SEDUCED HIM SHE'S CERTAIN OF THAT THEY BOTH WERE BUT THAT FIRST KISS WHEN I LOOK BACK OU IT HE DID INSTIGATE THIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE HAD THE NERVE IT SIXTEEN THEN LATER SEVENTEEN TO HAVE ACTED UPON ALL THE THINGS THAT I ACTED UPON WITHOUT HIM BEING THE INITIAL INSTIGATOR AN MAKING YOUR SELF THE INSTIGATOR WERE YOU PROTECTING HIM YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK SO AH I THINK THAT I WAS TRYING TO TELL THE TRUTH OF MY OWN DESIRE I SAW HIM I WANTED HIM AND I WENT AFTER HIM AND I DON'T THINK I KNEW HOW TO RECONCILE THAT WITH THE IDEA THAT HE KISSED ME FIRST N HER FORTIES JE'LL WANTED TO WITE A LOVE STORY ABOUT LOVE ACROSS A GREAT AGE SPAM THIS KIND OF STORY IT'S ALMOYS ALWAYS TOLD FROM THE MAN'S POINT OF VIEW JELL WANTED TO WRITE IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN AND ALSO NOT MAKE HER THE VICTIM AND EVEN THOUGH JALLS TELL EMPHATICALLY DOES NOT SEE HERSELF AS A VICTIM SOME OF THE CHOICE AS SHE MATE IN WRITING HER FIRST MAMOIR SEEMS STARTLING TO R LIKE HER ACCOUNT OF A LETTER ONOLD CENTER AFTER THEY SLEPT TOGETHER DEAR JILL ARE YOU EVER COMING BACK TO CLASS WHEN SHE DIDN'T RES POND HE CALLED HER AND I FIRST MAMOIR JE'LL PLAYS THE ANECDOTE FOR LAUGHS THE FIRST TIME IT'S TREATED LIKE OF COURSE IT'S FUNNY WHAT FORTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MAN IS GAN O WRITE A LITTLE GIRL AT HER HOUSE WHEN HER MOTHER CAN OPEN THE MAIL BUT WHEN I RE WROTE IT THIS TIME WHAT I SAW WAS I SAW FORTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MAN HAVING MADE LOVE TO A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL AFTER WHICH HE DOESN'T HEAR FROM HER FOR A MONTH HE WRITES A LETTER TO HER HOUSE SOLICITING HER AGAIN IN THIS SORT OF IN A VAKE LOVE LETTER AND WHEN HE DOESN'T HER BACK FROM THAT LITTLE GIRL AGAIN HE CALLS HER NOW AND IN TO DAY'S WORLD WE WOULD SEE THAT AS A PREDITOR GOING AFTER AN UNDER AGE GIRL AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT I'M I'M TOTALLY SHOCKED I'M SHOCK THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT THE FIRST TIME BUT YOU KNOW THE END OF A STORY REALLY REALLY MAKES YOU CHANGE THE BEGINNING AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF IT I THINK THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT I WROTE IT THIS WAY IS BECAUSE I WAS HAVING A WONDERFUL MARRIAGE AND PART OF THE REASON I WROTE IT THIS WAY WAS BECAUSE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY WHEN ALL THIS STUFF WAS HAPPENING IT WASN'T AS APPALLING FOR AN OLDER MAN TO DO THIS BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NOBODY EVER SAID TO JELL THAT THEY SAW ANYTHING APPALLING AN ARNOLD'S BEHAVIOR AT LEAST NOT DIRECTLY HERE TO THINK I CAN'T I MEAN I REMEMBER GOING TO A PARTY ONE TIME WHEN WE WERE FIRST GOING OUT WHERE THE HOSTESS SERVED EVERYONE A MARTENIIN ME A GLASS OF MILK SO I'M I'M SURE PEOPLE NOTICED O KY WHEN JELL LOOKED BACK AT THE FIRST BOOK SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE PART SHE LEFT OUT PARTS OF SCENES THE MASSIER MORE REVEALING PARTS BUT OTHER HOMISSIONS TOO ONCE THAT ARE MORE PROFOUND LIKE ABOUT HER FATHER WHO WAS THE EXACT SAME AGE AS ARNOLD MOST OF THE FIRST BOOK IS ACTUALLY ABOUT JELL'S FATHER SHE ONLY MEEDS ARNOLD ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH BY THAT POINT HER FATHER HAD MOVED OUT SHE RARELY SAW HIM HE WAS TROUBLED AND EXPLOSIVE AND INCAPABLE OF EMOTIONAL CONNECTION ESSENTIALLY ABSENT FROM HER LIFE I FOUND HER WRITING ABOUT HIM WRENCHING BUT WEIRDLY INCOMPLETE IT WAS JUST SO CLEAR THAT YOUR ARD TEACHER WAS A SUBSTITUTE FOR YOUR FATHER AND SO MANY WAYS AND YOU DON'T WRITE EXPLICITLY ABOUT THIS IN HALF A LIFE AND I WONDER IF HE COULD TALK ABOUT WIE YOU KNOW I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T DO IT I MEAN I'M DOING IT NOW IN THIS FERSION IT AT FORTY FIVE IT SEEMED OBVIOUS AND THE OBVIOUS I IN THOSE DAYS I BELIEVE MADE THINGS LESS LITERARY GOD KNOWS WHY OD KAY LUT THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVED AND I JUST DON'T THINK ITS TRUE ANY MORE AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT A FATHERLESS GIRL GOSE OUT AND FINDS THEM A FATHER AND THEN USES THAT MAN TO HEALED THEMSELF OF HAVING NEVER BEEN LOVED BY AN OLDER MAN I MEAN MAYBE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT AT THAT AGE MAYBE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO WHILE BOTH MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND WERE ALIVE WHAT HAS RE EXAMINING YOUR STORY LIKE THIS DONE TO TO YOUR PICTURE OF YOUR HUSBAND OR YOUR MEMORIES OF HIM OR YOUR PERCEPTION OF YOUR MARRIAGE WELL I MEAN IT IT IT CHANGES THE PICTURE BECAUSE I CAN'T AND NOW LOOK AT HIM WITHOUT REALIZING THE LINES THAT HE CROSSED AND AT THE SAME TIME IM REALLY GLAD THAT WE CROSSED THOSE LINES I REALLY QUESTION A LOT OF THESE YOU KNOW THESE THESE INFERENCES THAT IT IS ALWAYS WRONG IT WASN'T WRONG FOR ME AND IT WILL NEVER CHANGE MY FEELINGS ABOUT IT BEING IN AMAZING MARRIAGE WHAT WHAT THINGS DO YOU SAY IN THE NEW BOOK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARD FOR HIM TO READ OH MY GOD THE WHOLE THING I MEAN I I WOULD NEVER HAVE WRITTEN THIS BOOK IF HE WAS AVE I MEAN IT WOULD BE SO HURTFUL LIKE  IN HALF A LIFE HE SEEMS YOU KNOW LIKE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL OLDER MAN AND TO DESCRIBE HIM AS SOMEBODY WHO HAD A MIDLIFE CHRISES AND WAS STRUGGLING TO FIND HIMSELF AGAIN I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY PAINFUL FOR HIM TO READ ARNOLD WAS A PAINTER HE WAS STRUGGLING AS AN ARTIST WHEN JO'LL MET HIM BUT HE FLOURISHED IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT THE THING ARNOLD WOULD BE HURT BY IS THE DEPICTION OF HIM AS A STRUGGLING MIDDLE AGED MAN AND NOT THE QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS ROLE AS POSSIBLE PREDITOR OR AGGRESSOR I DON'T THINK HE WOULD I MEAN I DON'T THINK HE EVER THOUGHT OF ME BUT MAYBE HE DID WHO KNOWS O  I THINK THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF ME AS SOME ONE WHO WASN'T AS STRONG IS HIM YET AND SO I THINK HE WOULD BE I THINK HE E SHOCKED AND SURPRISED BY THESE NEW ANCES IN WHICH I'M LOOKING BACK AT OUR RELATIONSHIP THE QUESTIONS YELLS ASKING ABOUT WHAT SHE INCLUDED IN WHAT SHE LEFT OUT ABOUT WHAT SHE REALIZES NOW THAT SHE DIDN'T BACK THEN THOSE QUESTIONS INTEREST ME BECAUSE THE ARE QUESTIONS I'M ASKING MYSELF RITE NOW TOO I'M ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AGE AS JILL WAS WHEN SHE WROTE HALF A LIFE AND I HAVE A MEMOIR COMING OUT IN A FEW MONTHS THE BOOK TELLS THE STORY OF MY ADOLESCENCE THAT I ASSUME IT REVEALS JUST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE ABOUT WHO I AM NOW AT FORTY SIX THAN WHO I WAS AT SIXTEEN IT'S ABOUT THE EATING DISORDERS THAT TO FIND MY TEEN EGHE YEARS AND IF I'M BEING HONEST MY ADULTHOOD TOO UNTIL RECENTLY I'D NEVER TALKED ABOUT THIS STUFF WITH ANY ONE SO IN THAT WAY THE BOOK IS VERY EXPOSING BUT MAYBE WHAT'S NOT THERE IT'S JUST AS REVEALING I KNOW THERE'S A LOT I CAN'T YET SEE AND I WANTED TO TALK TO JILL ABOUT THAT I KNOW THAT IF I'D YOU KNOW WAITED ANOTHER FIVE YEARS I WOULDHAVE UNDERSTOOD MORE AND AND SOMETIMES I WONDER SHOULD HAVE WAITED TO TELL MY STORY UNTIL I UNDERSTOOD IT BETTER BUT I DON'T I'D I DON'T THINK YOU  I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND MY STORY ANY BETTER THAN I DID AT FORTY FIVE VOQUET YEH I LOOK BACK AT MY FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD SELF AND I THINK OH MY GOD SHE SHE DIDN'T HAVE THIS INFORMATION I I SEE HOW YOUNG I WAS AT FORTY FIVE I LOOK AT MY FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD SELF IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT MY FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD SELF LOOKED AT MY SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SELF AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A KIND OF COMPASSIONATE VIEW OF WHO YOU WERE BEFORE YOU HAD ALL THE INFORMATION YEH WHEN YOU THINK O BOUT YOURSELF AT FORTY FIVE HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD SELF NOW DIFFERENTLY THAN SHE SAW HERSELF AH AT THAT POINT I I WAS STILL THINKING ABOUT THE ESCENT OF LIFE YOU KNOW I WAS STILL MOVING IN THIS THIS FORWARD MOTION I WAS YOU KNOW AT THE  MAYBE AT THE HEIGHT OF MY POWERS AND WHEN I LOOK BACK AT THAT I REALIZE HOW HOW DELUSIONAL THAT IS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR WRITING AT FORTY FIVE FROM ALL THE INFORMATION EXPERIENCE YOU'VE HAD WHAT I DIDN'T HAVE WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF TAKING MY HUSBAND ALL THE WAY TO DEATH IN HER NEW BOOK JILS NOT JUST EXPLORING THE BEGINNING OF HER RELATIONSHIP SHE'S WREATING ABOUT THE END OF IT TOO IT'S THE SECOND PART OF SLEEPING WITH YOUR PROFESSOR IT'S THE EN OF DEPART IN A WEARE SUDDENLY YOU GO FROM BEING THE YOUNG LOVER TO THE CARETAKER AND THAT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TRANSITION TAKING SOME ONE TO DEATH THAT'S THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE THERE IS AND SO IN SOME WAYS WHO KISSD WHOM FIRST SEEMS REALLY SMALL IN IN THE LENGTH OF THIS JOURNEY JIL ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE MORE INTERESTING WAY TO WRITE MEMOIR WOULD BE TO RETURN AGAIN AND AGAIN TO A MONUMENTAL MOMENT IN A LIFE RATHER THAN TELLING THE STORY IN ORDER ALL THE WAY THRILL REVISITING A STORY DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT ANY BETTER SHE SAYS BUT IT DOES MAKE IT DIFFERENT EVEN WHEN WE WREAD ABOUT THE PAST WERE ALWAYS TELLING A STORY ABOUT THE PRESEN WHETHER WE MEAN TO OR NOT  MOSOS A BURDEN AS ONE OF M MISSUS

EVERY LAST COMMENTS ALL THESE PEOPLE REJOICING FOR AND REMEMBERING HER SON I HAVE LISTENED TO THAT THING LIKE A HUNDRED TALKINGS I THINK AS I KEEP BEN JOYING IT IT WAS WHAT YORS WAS ACREDIBLE JUST WAS INCREDIBLE MOMEN ATARM BOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE ASKED THEM QUESTIONS PUTING THEM IN THIS COMPLICATED SPOBUT THIS TIME INFRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT ENDED WITH A ROOMFUL OF STRANGERS CHEERING FOR MACS THIS TIME IS THEIR FAVORITECRISPENDER AF S ONE OF THE PRODUCES ON A SHOW COMING UP THE QUESTION ABOUT A FOUR HUNDRED YEAR OLD PLAY ADD THE PERSONAL QUESTION UNDERNEATH THAT QUESTION IT'S A MENUTE CICAGOPOBOGRIDIO WHEN A PROGRAM CONTINUES THIS MERICON LIE FRO MYRGLASS TAY'S PROGRAMM THE QUESTION TRAP WE WERE TUK HIM THAT TODAY IS THOSE QUESTIONS THAT CAN SEEM BENEVOLENT INNOCENT HARMLESS AND NOCCUUS COULD NOT HEART A FLY BUT UNDERNEATH THE REALLY ASKING SOMETHING ELSE WE QUIETLY MAKING A POINT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE WEVE ARRIVED TO QUESTION THREE OF OUR PROGRAMM QUESTION THREEH HAS YOUR MAM SH WE SPOUT OF THIS NEXT THING WE WENT TO PLAY YOU IN AN ACADEMIC JOURNAL AS ORIGINALLY A PAPER IN MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY READ BY ANETHROPOLOGISTS NAMED GENOW TAILOR WHO ADAPTED IT TO READ HERE ON THE RADIO THIS ONE QUESTION THE GENERAL TELL IS WRITING ABOUT IT KEPT SHOWING UP ALL THE TIME IN AR PERSONAL LIFE SHE S AS IS ANANTHROPOLOGIST SHE KNOWS WHENE LOTS OF PEOPLE OR ASKING THE SAME QUESTION OVER AND OVER HIT MEAN SOMETHING SHE RODE THE SAS SAY TO THINK THROUGH WHAT IS UNDERNEATH THAT ESTION MY MOTHER IS LIVING WITH PROGRESSIVE DIMENSIA BECAUSE I'M READING THESE WORDS ON THE RADIO I CAN'T HEAR YOUR RESPONSE BUT I'M LISTENING FOR THE QUESTION THAT AS I'VE LEARNED ALWAYS COMES EVERY ONE ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION RESPONDS WITH SOME VERSION OF THE SAME QUESTION DOES SHE RECOGNIZE YOU THERE ARE VARIANCE OF COURSE DOES SHE STILL KNOW WHO YOU ARE BUT DOES SHE STILL KNOW YOUR NAME HOWEVER IT MAY BE PHRAISE THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS WHETHER MY MOTHER RECOGNIZES ME MEANING CAN SHE RECITE THE FACTS OF WHO I AM WHAT MY NAME IS THAN HOW I'M RELATED TO HER WHEN EVERY ONE KEEPS ASKING ME DOES SHE RECOGNIZE YOU I FIND MYSELF THINKING THAT IS THE WRONG QUESTION I BELIEVE THE QUESTION REALLY IS OR SHOULD BE DO YOU DO WE RECOGNIZE HER AS A PERSON WHO STILL HERE DOES SHE RECOGNIZE YOU THE WEIRDNESS OF THE QUESTION BECOMES MORE OBVIOUS IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ANSWER IT LETS SAY I ASK MY MOTHER WHAT'S MY NAME WHO AM I HOW OLD AM I HOW DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER TESTING HER THAT WAY WHAT IS IT PROVE WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH I READ A BOOK BY A JOURNALISTS NAME LOREN CESTLER SHE WROTE ABOUT HOW SHE WOULD CORRECT HER OWN MOTHER WHEN HER MOTHER CALED HER BY THE WRONG NAME EVERY TIME SHE WOULD VISIT HER MOTHER SHE'D TAKE FRAMED PHOTOES FROM THE DRESS AR IN POINT TO THEM AND QUIS HER MOTHER YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS DON'T YOU MAM OF COURSE SHE DIDN'T KESTLE WRITES SO I TOLD HER AGAIN AND AGAIN EACH VISIT WHO IS WHO AND THEN QUIZED AGAIN THINKING BACK ON THIS NOW I AM APPALLED AT MY INSENSITIVITY WHAT DID I THINK I WAS DOING I MANAGE TO ACCOMPLISH ONLY TWO THINGS I MADE MYSELF MISERABLE AND I MADE MY MOTHER IRRITABLE I DON'T NEED MY MOTHER TO TELL ME MY NAME OR HOW I'M RELATED TO HER IREADY KNOW THESE THINGS AND I KNOW THAT SHE HAS DOMENSIA SO WHY THEN WHEN I MAKE A POINT OF ASKING HER THESE QUESTIONS THAT I KNOW SHE CAN'T POSSIBLY ANSWER IT SEEMS RUDE OR JUST MEAN I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO DO IT I GUESS SHE COULD SAY THAT MY MOTHER RAISE ME BETTER THAN THAT     WODOES SHE RE COGNIZE YOU I'M NOT SO CONVINCE THAT THE INABILITY TO REMEMBER NAMES NECESSARILY MEANS THAT A PERSON WITH DIMENSIA CAN'T RECOGNIZE OR CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE BUT VERY OFTEN IT DOES MEAN THAT OTHER PEOPLE STOP RECOGNIZING AND CARING ABOUT THEM MY MOTHER WAS CLOSE TO LOTS OF PEOPLE BUT ONLY ONE FRIEND REMAINS PRESENT IN HER LIFE EVERY MONTH OR TWO ELI DAVIS DRIVES AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM HER HOME TO SIATTLE TO VISIT MAM BRINGING TREATS AND HUGS AND ARE ALWAYS CHEERFUL SELF I LOVE HER DEARLY FOR IT AND I WONDER WHERE ARE THE OTHERS WHEREARE THE COUPLES WITH WHOM I PARENTS SOCIALIZED THE WOMEN WITH WHOM MAM SPENT HOURS AND HOURS ON THE PHONE ALL THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD THIES SHOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AS MUCH AS IT HAS MAYBE IT'S NOT FAIR TO EXPECT FRIENDS TO STEP UP EVEN CLOSE FAMILY DROP OFF FRIENDSHIPS IN AMERICA ARE NOT USUALLY EXPECTED TO SURVIVE DEMENSIA FRIENDSHIPS ARE OFTEN MORE LIKE PLEASURE GRAFTS THAN LIFE RAFTS NOT BUILT TO BRAVE THE REALLY ROUGH WATERS THEN  DOES SHE RECOGNIZE YOU WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHETHER MY MOTHER STILL RECOGNIZE   ME THEY'RE OFTEN EXPRESSING CONCERN FOR ME ASKING ME HOW I'M BEARING UP UNDER THE BURDEN OF SUFFERING THAT HER DIMENSION MUST PLACE ON ME AND AY'RE QUITE READY TO HEAR ABOUT MY BURDENS IN MY SUFFERING WHAT THEY FIND HARDER TO HEAR I THINK IS IT BEING AROUND MY MOTHER IS NOT A NIGHTMARE OR A HORROR IS NOT LIKE ANY OF THAT HERE'S WHAT IT IS IN A CAFE AS WE SHARE ASCONE MAMM AND I MAKE WHAT PASSES FOR CONVERSATION I'VE LEARNED TO ASK ONLY THE SORT OF QUESTION THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC INFOR MATION TO ANSWER SO THINGS GOING O KAY WITH YOU THESE DAYS HOW'S MY FAVOURITE MAM DOING YOU'RE DOING ALL RIGHT I TELL HER FUNNY LITTLE STORIES ABOUT MY KIDS SOMETIMES WE LEAVE THROUGH A MAGAZINE LOOKING AT THE PICTURES AND COMMENTING ON THEM SOMETIMES WE LOOK OUT THE WIND DOW AND I MAKE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS THAT REQUIRE NO SPECIFIC RESPONSE LOOKS LIKE SPRING IS COMING LOOK AT THOSE LEAVES COMING OUT ON THE TREES BACKI'S HARE IS REALLY CURLY WITH EACH EXCHANGE MAMM SMILES ON ME BEAMING AFFECTIONATELY AND THAT FAMILIAR SLIGHTLY CONSPIRATORIAL WAY AS IF WE'RE BOTH IN ON THE SAME JOKE SO OUR CONVERSATIONS GO NOWHERE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE SAY REALLY OR WHETHER WE SET IT BEFORE OR WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE OR INTERESTING OR EVEN COMPREHENSIBLE THE EXCHANGE IS THE POINT MAMM AND I ARE PLAYING CATCH WITH TOUCHES SMILES AND GESTURES AS WELL AS WORDS MAMBING THEM BACK AND FORTH TO EACH OTHER IN SLOW EASY UNDERHAND ARKS THE FACT THAT SHE DROPS THE BALL MORE AND MORE OFTEN DOESN'T STOP THE GAME FOR BEING ENJOYABLE IT'S A WAY OF BEING TOGETHER DOES SHE RECOGNIZE YOU SHE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE ME IN A NARROWLY COGNITIVE SENSE BUT MAMAUM DOES RECOGNIZE ME AS SOME ONE WHO'S THERE WITH HER SOMEONE FAMILIAR PERHAPS AND SHE DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE ALL THE DETAILS SORTED OUT IN ORDER TO CARE FOR ME THE IMPULSE TO CARE THE HABIT OF CARING THESE ARE THINGS THAT RUN DEEP IN MY MOTHER SOME ONE WHO FOR MOST OF HER LIFE WAS VERY ENGAGED IN CARING FOR OTHER PEOPLE HER CHILDREN OR A HUSBAND HER GRANDCHILDREN AND HER FRIENDS EVEN SOME OF THE BEHAVOUROLD WORKS OF MY MAMMA'S DEVELOP MAKE SENSE TO ME IN THOSE TERMS AS EXPRESSIONS OF CARE HERE'S AN EXAMPLE PEOPLE WITH DO MEN SHALL OFTEN ENGAGE IN REPETITIVE BEHAVIOURS AND MAMMA IS NO EXCEPTION WHEN I TAKE HER OUT TO A CAFE I USUALLY GET A CUP OF BLACK COFFEE FOR MYSELF AND ORDER A CUP A HOT CHOCOLATE FOR HER NOT TOO HOT AND DON'T FORGET THE WHIP CREAM ON TOP AS WE DRINK THEM SHE CHECKS CONSTANTLY TO SEE WHETHER MY CUP AND HERS ARE EVEN WHETHER THE LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN DRUNK DOWN TO THE SAME LEVEL AND IF NOT SHE'LL HURRY UP AND DRINK MORE TO CATCH UP OR ELSE STOP AND WAIT FOR ME OR IF WE SHARE A COOKIY SHE'S CONCERN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HAVES BE THE SAME SIZES AND THAT WE EAT THEM AT THE SAME RATE I THINK KEEPING TRACK OF WHETHER OUR DRINKS AND COOKIES ARE EVEN COMES NATURALLY TO MY MOTHER A WOMAN WHO IS ALWAYS HAD TO CAREFULLY DIVIDE QUITE LIMITED RESOURCES FIRST WITH HER OWN BROTHERS AND LATER AMONG HER FOUR CHILDREN SHE'S CARED ABOUT SUCH DETAILS ALL HER LIFE AND CARING ABOUT THEM WAS ALSO A WAY IN WHICH SHE CARED FOR OTHER PEOPLE MAMM ALSO DOES STILL TAKE CARE OF ME IN SOME SMALL BUT IMPORTANT WAYS ONE TIME A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO I STOPPED BY THE ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY WHERE SHE WAS LIVING AT THE END OF A VERY BUSY DAY AND IN ESPECIALLY HECTIC WEEK I HAD STAYED UP VERY LATE THE NIGHT BEFORE TRYING

AN ESSAY THAT SLIKE YES A TFELLOW IS VERY RASIST THE STORY OF THE PLAY IS THERE'S THE SUPER PROFESSIONALLY AND ROMANTICALLY SUCCESSFUL BLACKMAN ALL OF THESE WHITE GEYES ARE JEALOUS OF AN CANNOT HANDLE THAT TENSION IS RESOLVED WHEN THE WHITE GUEY'S TRICK ATELLOW AND MURDERING HIS WIFE THEREBY TURNING HIM INTO THE BRUTISH STEREOTYPE THEY WANTED HIM TO BE ALALONG THAT THE TITLE ROLL WAS PERFORMED IN BLACKFACE FOR CENTURIES UNDER SCORSLIS MOREOVER THAT'S THE GOOD THAT KIND OF A TRANSITION WORD DIVE YA MOREOVER I MAN MY NEXT BODY PARAGRAPH WILL BE ABOUT MOREOVER DESTIMONA'S WHITENESS IN CONTRAST IS REPEATEDLY PRESENTED AS A NATELY GOOD INNOCENT AND DESIRABLE THAT'S ONE I SAY YOU COULD WRITE THAT WOULD GET AN A THE OTHER ASSAY YOU COULD WRITE THAT WOULD ALSO GET AN A GOES NO A THELLOW IS NOT SUPER RASIST A TELLOW IS A FLAUD ATTEMPT AT ANTIRASISM IN THAT IT SHAKESPEARE'S ONLY PLAY TO CENTERE A DYNAMIC BLACK PROTAGONIS THE PLAY WAS BAND IN A PARTI SOUTH AFRICA FOR DEPICTING AN INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIP MOREOVER THE PLACE MOST PREJUDIUE CHARACTERS ARE ALWAYS PRESENTED AS EITHER STUPID RODRIGO OR EVIL YAGO IT WOULD BE MISTAKE TO CONPLAYE THE PRERE PECTIVES OF THESE CHARACTERS WITH THE MEANINGS OF THE WORK AS HE WHOLE EITHER THE THE SAS WOULD GET AS DIVYA BUT WHAT YOUR TEACHER'S REDUCTED YES IN A PROMP DOES NOT ALOW FOR IS AN ESSAY THAT LIKE WHAT I THINK I THINK WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE A TELLOW IS HE PRODUCT AN REFLECTION OF ANOTHER CULTURE ELIZABETH IN ENGLAND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD RICH N AT A TIME WHEN RACE WITH JUST BEING INVENTED AS A SYSTEM OF OWER THE PLAY LATER BECAME A CULTURAL EXPORT OF THE BRITISH EMPIR WHICH COLONIZED BLACKEN PROWN PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THE PLAY REMAINS THE BEST FELLAR OF THE SHAKESPEARE IN DUSTRIAL PCOMPLEX ANOTHER WORDS O GIVE YOU A FELLO AND RACISM ARE SO INDELIBLY LINKED THAT THE QUESTION IS AFELLO RACIS SEEMS TO CONFUSE BOTH WHAT RACISM IS AND WHAT ARTWORKS ARE IN MY OPINION WITH REALLY RACEAS DIVIA IS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO READ

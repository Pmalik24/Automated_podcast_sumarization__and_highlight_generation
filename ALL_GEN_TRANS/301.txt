IF HE LISTENED HARD ENOUGH HE THEULGHT HE COULD HEAR THE WAYS HITTING MAYME BENDER SHIRT STORY IS CALLED WOZER IT'S FROME R COLLECTION AF SHIRT FICTION CALLED THE GIRL IN THE FLIMABLE SKIRT HI'S READ FORS MY MAMOY COMING OUT WHAT DES IT MEAN WHEN YOU GET OUT OF PRISON KICK YOUR DRUG HABIT RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF YOUR CRIMES AND E LITTLE KIDS MAKE FUN OF YOU CAN TE GARDEN CON IN A MINUTE CHICOGO BUB A GRADIO WHEN OUR PROKAM CONTINUES TIS MERICIN LIFE MYRE GLASS EAT YOOKIN A PRIGRIM OF COURSE WE CHOOSE SOME THEME BRING YOU DIFFERENT KINDS OF STORIES ON THAT THEME TO DAY SHOW CRIME SCENES IN THE STORIES THEY TELL SO TO DAY'S UPISED FIRST TAIR YEARS AGO AN I SOMEWAY WE REALIZED HEURE AD A PROGRAME THAT WE HAD A QUESTION AN ACTUAL QUESTION ABOUT CRIME SCENES SOMETHING WONDERED ABOUT WATCHING THE NEWS I A OM BANAT AMOL OA SIC ACOLOGIST O YEAROP ACOLOGIST A QUESTION WAS ABOUT ALWAYS SHOOTINGS IN THE WAY THE CRIMESEN EVIDENCE COULD BE IN TERPRETED AFTER THE FACT SO DIFFERENTLY BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE S FOR EXAMPLE AFTER STUFF ON CLARK WAS SHOT BY SACRAMENTAPLIESE BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEENE  CONNY CORONER DID AN OFFICIAL OTOPSY FOR THE STATE BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THE FAMILY ALSO HIRED A WELL KNOWN FRENCS IS TATHOLOGIST THIS MAN OU'RE HEARING RIGHT NOW THEN IT A MAWO WHTO DOAN ALTOPSY FOR THEM HE ANNOUNCE HIS FINDINGS OF THEIS PRESS CONFERENC AND ON'T IF YOU REMEMBER THAT CASE BUT STUFF ON CLARK WAS TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD UNARMED SHOPY POLICE MULTIPLE TIMES DOCTOR MAIS AND ALICIS CAME OUT BEFORE THE COUNTY CORNERS IAND HE WAS DEFINITIVE ABOUT A NUMBER OF THING E WE A TOL TE LO EIT CON SHO ONCE MEM GO HE WAS HEAT I E FOLE THE FIRST SHOT AMAWAS SAID IT STUFF ON CLARK IN THE SIDE WITEN SPUN HIM AROUND SO HIS BACK WAS TO THE OFFICERS THEN SIX OF THE EIGHT SHOTS WERE TIL HIS BACK YUTHAT IS A DIFFERENT STORY THIN THE POLICE HAD TOLD PLESA SAID HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN THE FIRED SO THE CAASISHI TAT HOSCE I SEN A A HE WAS A SILLY THE FI SERS IS A CO SISTO WI I FIT FILLY FORA SIC ABIT WEEKS LATER THE COUNTY REESED ITS REPORT IT WAS DIFFERENT DOCTOR MALWAS REPORT IN SOME SIGNIFICANT WAYS FIRST IT SAID THERE WERE SEVEN BULLETS NOT EIGHT IT SAID ONLY THREE SHOTS WERE TO THE BACK NOT SIX AND AS FOR THE FIRST SHOT THE COUNTY SAID IT WAS PROBBY TO HIS THIDE AND THE CLOCK PROBABLY WAS WALKING TOWARDS THE OFFICERS WHEN IT HAPPEN ND WE WONDERED HERE TO SHOW HOW COULD SOMETHING SO BASIC BE IN DISPUTE THE NUMBER SHOTS WHETHER THEY ENTERED FROM THE BACKER FROM THE FRONT DOS THAT INTICATE THE ONE OF THE AUTOPSIES WAS DELIBERATELY SPINNING THE RESULTS OR THESE ACTUAL HONEST SCIENTISTS SO WE DISAGREEING ABOUT THE EVIDENCE ITS IN FRONT OF THEM HI ASKED DOCTOR JUDY MELANECK A VETTERAN FRIENDS OC PATHOLOGISTS WHO PERFORMED AUTOPSIES IN THE BAAREA FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND SHE SAID THESE KINDS OF DISCREPANCIES HAPPEN ALL THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE TWO AUTOPSIES OF THE SAME PERSON  SAID IN THESE KINDS OF CASES THE OFFICIAL AUTOPSY THE CORONER'S OFFICE USUALLY HAPPENS FIRST AND THEN THE FAMILY GETS TO DO THEIR AUTOPSY AFTER THAT AT'S TRUE EVEN THOUGH THE FAMILY USUALLY GOES PUBLIC WITH THEIR RESULTS FIRST AS HAPPEN IN THIS CASE SO DOCTOR MELANECK SAYS PICTURE OKA TWO AUTOPSIES BY TWO DOCTORS THE FIRST AUTOPSY DOWN BY THE CORNERS OFFICE ALTERS THE BODY AND CHANGES THE EVIDENCE SO IT MAKES IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE SECOND PATHOLOGIST WHEN THE SECOND PATHOLOGIST GETS THE BODY IT'S ALREADY BEEN WATCHED CUEEN SO DOESNT OFE ANY BLOOD STAINS OR TRACE RESIDO THE FIRST PATHOLOGISTS ARREADY CUT OPEN THE BODY IT'S ALREADY REMOVED THE BULLETS SO WHEN DOCTOR MOLO GOT THE BODY HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BULLETS ANY MORE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT BY THE FIRST AUTOPSY AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE EXRACE OF THE BODY FROM THE FIRST AUTOPSY WECH WAYS SHOWN HIM WHERE THE BULLETS HAD BEEN HE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE ORGANS IN THEIR PROPER ORIENTATION IN THE BODY THE ORGANS HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT BY THE PREVIOUS AUTOPSY PATHOLOGIST AND SLIE STOP TWO IDENTIFY THE WOUND TRACKS AND THEN PUT IN PLASTIC BAG INSIDE THE BODY CAVITY SO THE FIRST PATHOLOGIST HAS THAT ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY GOT THE BODY PRISTIN AND IT WASN'T ALTERED IN THIS WAY DOCTOR MELANECK SAYS THERE CUN BE LOTS OF DISAGREEMENT AND IT CAN BE HONEST DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN PATHOLOGIST THEY ARE PEOPLE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SETS OF DATA SO THEY COME TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS SO AND WITH THAT WE HAVE ARRIVED A DACT THREE OF OUR PROGRAMM ACT THREE WER TURN TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IN O THIS IS SOME TRUE IS IM IN DETECTI FICTION THAT A CRIMINAL ALWAYS RETURNS TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME IT TURNS OUT IN REAL LIFE THAT ACTUALLY IS NOT VERY COMMON AT ALL EXCEPT AMONG ARSONISTS ARSON ISAPPARENTLY LIKE TO SEE THE FIRES THEY'VE SET AND THEN SOME OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY CAUGHT WHEN POLICE LOOK AT PICTURES TAKEN OF CROWDS AT FIRES AND THEN I CON AVE THIS IS RARE MAY BE NOT NOBODY REALLY KEEP TRACK O THIS KIND OF THING HERE E THE PEOPLE WHO CIRCLE BACK TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIMES TO UNDU TO RACE SOMETHING EAR LEAST A PROMISE THAT IT'S NEVER GON O HAPPEN AGAIN KATY DAVIS DISCOVERED THET ONE OF HER OWN NEIGHBORS IN WASHING IN DCE AN OLD FRIEND OF HERS WAS TRYING TO DO JUST THAT BOBBY COMES UP MY STREET

ALREADY FOLK SO BIG WIND FOR A DONAL TRUMP AFT THE SUPREME COURT TO DAY THE SUPREME COURT RULES NINE TO NOTHING UNANIMOUS COURT THE OU CANT JEST TOSSED ONAL TRUMP OFF A BALLOT FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES IN A STATE LIKE COLORADO YOU WILL RECALL THAT JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGOF THESE SUPREME COURT IN COLORADO DECIDED THAT T WAS PERFECTLLY AXCEPTABLE TO INVALIDATE DONALD TRUMP ON THE BALLOT IN COLORADO IN THE PRIMARYS AND THE GENERAL BHECAUSE HE WAS COTNQUOT AN INSURRECTIONIST THE BASIC PREMIS OF THEIR ARGUMENT WAS REALLY STUPID IT WAS THAT BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES BARS FROM OFFICE INSURRECTIONISTS THIS MEANS THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENT OF COLORADO CAN SIMPLY TO CTHE CLEAR TRUMP IN INSURRECTIONIST AND THEN TOSS HIM OFF THE BALLOT THAT HAD A BUNCH OF LEGAL PROBMS OF IT PROBNUMBER ONE HOW DO DEFINED INSURRECTIONIST PROMNUMBER TWO EVEN IF YOU WERE GOING TO DEFIND INSURRECTIONIST THAT WOULD THEORETICALLY HAVE TO BE DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL NOT THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE STATE FEDERAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION PROMNUMBER THREE HOW DO YEVEN TOFIND IT IN TERMS OF WHICH PARTY DEFINDS IT IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT DONE BISOMS OR OF ELECTIONS WARS DONE BY THE LEGISLATIURE HOW DOES IT DISTINGUISH ITSELF THE INSURRECTIONIST CLAS FROM SAY ISSUES WITH AGE BECAUSE AE STATE COULD THEORETICALLY THROW SOME ONE OFF THE BALLOT IF THEY WERE NOT SAY THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THE COULSAY THIS PERSON IS NOT ELIGIBLE THAT DON'T GET LISTED ON THE BALLOP ITHAT WOULD BE PRETTY OBVIOUS FROM THE FEDERAL LANGUAGE THAT PERSONS NOT ALLOWED INSURRECTIONIST IS A VAGUE TURMBARK BODOM LINE IS THE COURT RULES NINE NOTHING IN FAVOR OF DONALD TRUMP HE HAS TO BE PUT BACK ON THE BALLOT IN COLORADO THERE IS SOME MINOR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE JUSTICES OVER EXACTLY HOW IN THE FUTURE THESE  SORTS OF ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE ADJUDICATED BUT AGAIN THE BIG TICKAWAY IS THAT NINE NOTHING INCLUDING ALL THE DEMOCRATIC APPOINTED JUSTICES THEY SAY THE COLORADO STATE SUPREME COURT CAN NOT SIMPLY DECLARE THAT DONAL TRUMP IS AN INSURRECTIONIST AND THEREFORE HE CAN'T BE ON THE BALLOT ACCORDING TO THE COURT PROPOSED BY CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX AND RATIFIED BY THE STAXT AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH IS THE THE SECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT HAS THE INSURRECTIONIST CLAUS EXPANDED FEDERAL POWER AT THE EXPENSE OF STATE AUTONOMY AND THUS FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED THE BALANCE OF STATE AND FEDERAL POWER STRUCK BY THE CONSTITUTION SECTION THREE OF TE AMENDMENT RESTRICTS STATE AUTONOMY BUT THROUGH A DIFFERENT MEANS IT WAS DESIGNED TO HELP INSURE AND INJURING UNION BY PREVENTING FORMER CONFEDERATES FROM RETURNING TO POWER IN THE AFTERMOUTH OF THE CIVIL WAR SECTION THREE WORKS BY IMPOSING ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS I PREVENTIVE AND SEVERE PENALTY TIS QUALIFICATION FROM HOLDING A WIDE ARRAY OF OFFICES RATHER THAN BY GRANTING RIGHTS TO ALL ITS THEREFORE NECESSARY AS CHIEF JUST IS CHASTE CONCLUDED AND THE COLORADO ITSELF SUPREME COURTITZELF RECOGNIZED TO ASCERTAIN WHAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS AR RE EMBRACED BY THE PROVISTION THE CONSTITUTION POWERS CONGRESS TO PRESCRIBE HOW THOSE DETERMINATIONSSHOULD BE MADE SO THEY SAY THAT UNDER SECTION FIVE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO TH CONSTITUTION IT SHOULD BE CONGRESS TOFINDING WHO IS AN INSURRECTIONIST AND WHO IS NOT IS A CONGRESS IS SECTION FIVE POWER IS CRITICAL WHEN IT COMES TO SECTION THREE THE CASE RAISES THE QUESTION OF WEATHER STATES INDITION ECONGRESS CAN ALSO IN FORCE SECTION THREE WE CONCLUDE STATES MADE IS QUALIFY PERSONS HOLDING OR ATTEMPTING TO HOLD STATE OFFICE BUT STATES HAVE NO POWER UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO ENFORCE SECTION THREE WITH RESPECT TO FEDERAL OFFICIALS HE SPECIALLY THE PRESIDENCY SO THE CURTERS MAKING TWO SEPARAE ARGUMENTS ARGUMENT UMBER ONE IS THAT ONLY CONGRESS TO DEFINE THE WORD INSURRECTIONIST FOR PURPOSES AF WHO GETS ON THE BALLOT AND WHO DOES NOT ARGUMENT NUMBER TOO IS THAT EVEN IF THAT ARE NOT THE CASE THE STATES DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SO THEORETICALLY COULD AVE A DIFFERENT PART OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT ACTUALLY CREATED AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT WASN'T THE LEGISLATURE BUT STATES DON'T HAVE ANY POWER TO EN FORCE SECTION THREE WITH REGARD TO FEDERAL OFFICES ESPECIALLY THE PRESIDENCY ACCORDING TO THE COURT POWER OVER GOVERNMENTS IS NOT EXTEN TO FEDERAL OFFICE HOLDERS IN CANDIDATES BECAUSE FEDERALH OFFICERS OWE TEIR ENTIRE EXISTENCE AN FUNCTIONS THE UNITED VOIS OF THE WHOLE MOT A PORTION OF THE PEOPLE POWER OVER THEIR ELECTION AND QUALIFICATIONS MUST BE SPECIALLY DELEGATED TO RATHER THAN RESERVED BY THE STATES SO AGAIN PRETTY EASY OBVIOUS OPINION NOW DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NOT ANY CONTROVERSY WITH REGARD TO THE OPINION SO BASELY AGAIN TERE ARE TWO ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT'S MADE ABOUT THAT IT CAN ONLY BE CONGRESS THAT DETERMINES WHOSE AN INSURRECTIONIST IN WHO IS NOT THAT ARGUMENT WAS NOT ANINO THE SECOND ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE WHICH IS THAT STATES CANNOT SIMPLY TOSS PEOPLE OUT FOR FEDERAL OFFICE BECAUSE THAT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S JOB THAT PARTICULAR ARGUMENT THEY AGREED WITH AS THE COURT SYS ALL MINE MEMBERS OF THE QURT AGREE WITH THE RESULT OUR COLLEGUES WERTING SEPARATELY FURTHER AGRE WITH MANY OF THE REASONS THIS OPINION PROVIDES FOR REACHING IT SO FAR AS WE CAN TELL THEY OBJECT ONLY TO OR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DISTINCTIVE WAY SECTION THREE WORKS AND THE FACT THET SECTION FIVE VESS IN CONGRESS THE POWER TO ENFORCE IT HAY SO THIS LEADS TO A CONCURRENCE WITH WITH THE SLIGHT DESCEND O ON SORT O THE RATION OUT FROM THE LIBERAL JUSTICIS SO TO MAYOR CAGAN AND JACKSON AND THIS ENTIRE OPINION IS WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY TO CREATES OR F A SIDE SHOW OFF CONTROVERSY BECAUSE AGATNS ANINO MEANING TERE REALLY IS NO CONTROVERSY EVERON AGREES COLORA CANCH AS TOSS TRUMP OFF THE BALLOT AND LINOIS CANCH O TROSS TOSS TRUMP OFF THE BALLOT MICHIGAN THE SAME SO THE MINORITY OPINION HERE CONCURRING IN JUDGEMENT TRIES TO FINE A POINT OF DIFFERINCIATION FROM THE MAJORITY OPINION SPECIFICALLY SO THEY CAN SAY THAT THE MAJORITY OPINION IS OVER REACHING IN FAVOR OF TRUMP AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT THEY SAY R THE ACTUALLY TRY TO GO OUT OF TEIR WAY TO SAY THIS SO THE DECENTERS SO TO MAYOR CAKEN IN JUSTIS JACTION AND THEY CONCUR BUT THEIR DISENTING ON S ONE PART OF THE OPINION THEY SAY THAT ALLOWING COLORADO TO SIMPLY DECLARE WHO CAN IN CAN'T BE ON BALLOT WOULD VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES BUT THEY SAY QUOTE THE MAJORITY GOES FURTHER EVEN THOUGH ALL NINE MEMBERS OF THE COURT AGREE THI INDEPENDENT AND SUFFICIENT RECTION ALL RESOLVES THE CASE FIVE JUSTICES GO ON THEY DECIDE NOVEL CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS TO INSULATE THIS COURT AND PETITIONER FROM FUTURE CONTROVERSY ALTHOUGH ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL STATE ACTION IS AT ISSUE HERE THE MAJORITY UPINS ON WHICH FEDERAL ACTRESS CAN INFORCE SECTION THREE AND HOW THEY MUST DO SO THE MAJORITY ANNOUNCE IS THAT IT DIS QUALIFICATION FOR INSURRECTION CAN ONLY OCCUR WHEN CONGRESS AND ACTS OF PARTICULAR KIND OF LEGISLATION PERSUEN A SECTION FIVE OF THE FORTIING THEMENDMENT AND HERE'S THE KEEPART THEY SAY QUO IN DOING SO THE MAJORITY SHUTS THE DOOR ON OTHER POTENTIAL MEANS OF FEDERAL INFORCEMENT WE CANNOT JOIN AN OPINION THAT DECIDES MOMENTOUS AND DIFFICULT ISSUES ONNECESSARILY AND WE THEREFORE CONCUR ONLY IN THE JUDGMENT SO WHAT  IREMAN UNDERSTAND THAT ALLTURNATIVE THEORY OF WHO EXACTLY WOULD DECIDEED THEY SAY THE QORTAL PINES ON HOW FEDERAL IN FORCEMENT OF SECTION THREE MUST PROCEED CONGRESS THE MAJORITY SAYS MUST ENACT LEGISLATION UNDERSECTION FIVE PRESCRIBING PROCEEDURES TO ASCERTAIN WHAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED THESE MUSINGS ARE INADEQUATELY SUPPORTED AS THEY ARE GROTUITOUS AGAIN THEY THEREN'N ACTUALLY OFFER AND ALTERNATIVE THEORY AS TO EXACTLY HOW SOMEBODY WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THEY SAY THAT THE'RE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BASICALLY RIPPD THE MAJORITY ON THE COURT EVENTHEG THE AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY ON THE COURT THEY SAY QUOTE SECTION THREE SERVES AN IMPORTANT THE RARELY NEEDED ROLL IN OUR DEMOCRACY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER TO VOTE FOR AN ELECT CANDIATES FOR NATIONAL OFFICE THAT IS GREAT AND GLORIOUS THING THE MEN WHO DRAFTAND RATIFY THE FORTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD WITNESSED AN INSURRECTION AN REBELLION TO DEFEN SLAVERY THEY WANTED TO MASURE THAT THOSE WHOAD PARTICIPATED IN THAT INSURRECTION AND IN POSSIBLE FUTURE INSURRECTIONS COULD NOT RETURN TO PROMINENT ROLES TO DAY THE MAJORITY GOESE BEYOND THE NECESSITIES OF THIS CASE TO LIMIT HOUSE SECTION THREE CAN BARN OATH BREAKING INSURRECTION AS FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT ALTHOUGH WE AGREE THAET COLERAG CANNOT IN FOR SECTION THREE WE PROTEST THE MAJORITYS EFFORTS USE THIS CASE TO FIND THE LIMITS A FEDERAL ENFORCEMEN OF THAT PROVISION SO WE CONCUR ONLY IN THE JUDGMENT THEY SAY THE QUORT QUOT REACHES OUT TO DESIDE SECTION THREE QUESTIONS NOT BEFORE US AND TO FORT QLOSE FUTURE EFFORTS TODSQUALIFY A PRESENENTUAL CANDIDATE UNDER THAT PROVISION AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAINGS THEY DID THIS FOR TRUMP NOW WHAT'S WEIRD IS THAT THER THEIR CLAIMING THAT THE SUPREME COURT MAJORITY WENT BEYOND ITS REMIT IN ORDER TO HELP TRUMP PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT IF SAY CONGRESS WERE RUN BY DEMOCRATS A SIMPLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION NOT DEFINING INSURRECTION BUT JUST SAYING DONALD TRUMP CANNOT RUN BECAUSE HE ISN'T INSURRECTIONISTS MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT WHICH AGAIN VERY VERY DOUBTFUL THA THAT'S THE CASE BOTTOM LINE THO IN THE END IS WHAT AMICONY BEARITSAYS SHE SAYS THISS NINE ZERO WE'RE DONE HERE BIG WIN  FOR NONAL TRUMP AGAIN THE ATTEMPT TO BARR TRUMP FROM THE BALLAT FAILING ONLY HELPS TRUMP AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT THE ONLY FACTOR TRUMP HAS GOING FORM THE POLLING DAY TO THEY CAME OUT OVER THE COURSE THF LAST THRE DAYS IS DEVASTATING FOR JOBITON'S CAMPAIGN SO JOBIDON IS IN SERIOUS SERIOUS TROUBLE WE SAY THIS OFTEN BUT THE REALITY IS THE JOBITON HAS NOT LED IN THE POLES AGAINST DONAL TRUMP FOR ONE THIRD OF A YEAR HAY THE FACT IS THE DONALD TRUMP IS THE LEADER IN THE CLUB HOUSE RIGHT NOW IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY HE WOULDN'T JUST WIN HE WOULD WIN BY A FAIRLY LARGE LEC TORAL MARGIN HE WOULD WIN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE ELECTORAL VOTES IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY AND MAY BE MORE GIVEN THE TREND LINES IN THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION THE LATEST EVIDENCE COMES CURTESY OF A HERRIFIC POLE  FOR JOBIDON FROM THE EW YORK TIME SIENNA IT CAME OUT OVER THE WEAKEN AND IT IS JUST AWFUL FOR JOBIDON THIS POLE SHOS THAT DONAL TRUMP IS BEATING JOBIDON FORTY EIGHT TO FORTY THREE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY JUST THE RESULT OF THE POLE THE TOP LINE RESULT OF POLE THATS A PROBLEM FOR JOBITON IS ALL THE CROSS TABS THE CROSS TABS ARE A DISASTER FOR JOBIDON CROSSTABS TUR THE DEMOGRAPHIC BREAK DOWNS BY GROUP FOR THE CANDIDATES SO UNDER THIS RUBRIC THE NEAR TIME SANAPOLE RUBRIC BY RACE DONALD TRUMP IN THIS POLE WINS HIS SPANICS OUTRIGHT FORTY SIX TO FORTY WHAT'S JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS DONAL TRUMP THE GUI WHO ONCE TREATED OUT THAT HE LOVES MEXICANS BECAUSE TOCOES IS BEATING JOBIDON FORT IX THE FORTY IN THIS POLE THE GUI WHO THE ENTIRE MEDIA SUGGESTED WOULD NEVER BE PRESENT HIM BECAUSE HE SAID THAT MEXICAN BAPAS FOR CRASIT BACKEI IS WINNING HIS BANNICS FORTY SIX TO FORTY WHICH AGAIN DEMONSTRATES HIS PANNIC NOT A GREAT CATCHALL CATEGORY NOT A GREAT CATCHALL TURPMANT ACTUALLY ENCUMPASES A WIDE VARIETY OF PEOPLE FROM A WIVE VARIETY OF BACKGROUNDS AND COUNTRIES HE IS WINNING THEM OUTRIGHT FORTY SIX TO FORTY BUT THE'S NOT THE ONLY SHOCKING CROSSTAB IN THIS POLE AMONG BLACK VOTERS JOBIDEN IS WINING JUST SIXTY SIX PER CENT VIRSE IS TWENTY THREE PER CENT FOR DONALD TRUMP SIXTY SIX PER CENT IS THE NMBERED NOTE THERE TWENTY THREE PER CENTES IT IF ANY REPUBLICAN WITH TWENTY THREE PER CENT OF THE BLACK VOTE IN A PRESIDENTIAL RACE THET REPUBLICAN WILL BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BUT SIXTY SIX PERCENT FOR JOBIDON IS A FULL SKALED DISASTER AREA YOU WIN TWO THIRDS OF THE BLACK VOTE AND YOUR A DEMOCRAT YOU ARE TOAST IN A PRESIDENTIAL RACE NOW AGAIN THESE CROSSTABS YEF TO TAKE THEM WITH A CERTAIN GRAIN OF SALT THEY'V HUGE MARGINS OF EROR UP TO TEN POINTS MARGINS VER FOR SOME OF THESE CROSSTABS BECAUSE CAN WE OU A POLE THE ACCURACY OF THE POLE DEPENS ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT YOU POLE THE LARGER GENERALLY THE POLE SAMPLE SIZE HE MORE ACCURATE THE POLE WHEN EA'RE LOOKING AT A POLE LIKE THIS ONEWHERE HE MIGHT HAVE NINETY PEOPLE WHO ARE HISPANIC RESPONDING THERE'S A LOT OF MARGIN FOR EIR HOWEVER IF THIS POLE IS UN REMOTELY CLOS JOBIDON IS BASICALLY TOSE AT THIS POINT DONAL TRUMP IS WINNING WHITE VOTERS OUTRIGHT FIFTY THREE TO FORTY INTERUMS OF AGE DEMOGRAPHIC THIS KIND OF A SHOCKING ONE JOBIDON IS WINNING PEOPLE SIXTY FIVE AND OVER WUT HUS GONE O SURPRISING BECAUSE VERY OFTEN THE OLDER VOTES TENTO SKE REPUBLICAN BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR POL AND I THE SELECTION TYCLE VOTERS AGED FHIRTY TO SIXTY FOUR BRADLY FAVOR DONAL TRUMP OVER JOBIDN IN THE SELECTION PARTICULARLY PEOPLE AGE FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY POLE IN OTHER WORDS THE PEOPLE WHARD JUST ABOVE THE MALENIALS THES SER JEN EX PEOPLE THOSE PEOPLE ARE VOTING FIXTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX FOR DONALD TRUMP ACCORDING TO THIS POLE WOMEN ARE SPLIT EVENLY BETWEEN BIDON AND TRUMP THERE'S NOT ONE GOOD PIECE OF DATA FOR JOBIDON IN THIS POLE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS POLE IS THAT WHAT IT DOES NOT SHOW IS THAT JOBIDON IS WILDLY UN POPULAR AMONG DEMOCRATS FOR EXAMPLE HE SHOWS THERE'S IT SHOWS THERE'S A LACKMENTHUSIASM FOR JOBIDON MONG DEMOCRATIC BASEVOTERS THEYRE NOT QUITE AS ENTHUSE TO VOTE AS REPUBLICAN BASEVOTERS WOULD BE THE REAL PROBLEM FOR JOBIDON IS NOT WITH HIS BATES IS WHAT I BEEN SAYING THE REAL PROBLEM FOR JOBIDON IS NOT WITH THE COMOSSNICS IN DEOBORN MICHIGAN THE REAL PROBLEM FOR JOBIDON IS NOT WITH RADICAL BEEL LEM TYPES INSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE PROBEM FOR JOBIDON IS THE HE GOVERNED AS A RATICAL BURNING SANDERS TYPE HE GOT INTO OFFICE AND HE DECIDE WHOS CAN GOVERN FAR TO THE LEFT INSTEAD OF ENTERING WITH THE COALITION THAT BROUGHT HIM AND THEN DANCING WITH THEM HE DECIDED TO JEDISON THE ENTIRE CENTER OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AND DONAL TRUMP IS GRADUALLY  TAKING OVER THE CENTER OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AS WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK ON THE SHOW YOU CANNOT NAME A POSITION IN MODERN AMERICAN POLITICS WHERE JOBIDON NOW OCCUPIES THE CENTERE AND DONAL TRUMP OCCUPIES THE PARIPHERY IT'S VIRTUALLY ALWAYS THE OTHER WAY ROUND INCLUDING MAIN STREAME DEMOCRATICH IRS LIKE ABORTION IT IS JOBIDON WHO'SE SAYING THINGS LIKE A BORTION UP UNTILL BIRTH AND IT IS DONAL TRUMP WHO'S NOT SAYING WE BANABORTION ALL THE WAY FROM INCEPTION IN CONCEPTION HE SAYS WE SHOULD BANABORTION FEDERALLY MAYBE AT SIXTEEN WEEKS WHICH IS A PRETTY BROAD CONCENTSIS POSITION IN THE AMERICAN POPULAS JOBIDON HAS ABANDONED THE MODERATES JOBIDON HAS LOST THE MODERATES HOW DO YOU WIN THOSE PEOPLE BACK SERIOUSLY HOW DO YOU DO IT I THING IS TOO LATE FOR HIM THIS A DISASTERARIA FOR NATE SILVER POINTS THIS OUT NATE SILVER EXCELLEN POLANALIST WHO AGAIN HAS FALLEN OUT OF GRACE WITH A MUNCHA LEFT WINGERS BECAUSE HE SUGGESTED HILLERY CLINTON WAS LIKEALLY TO WIN IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION AND THEN SHE DIDN'T ANDTHEN THEY GOT MAD AT THE MESSENGER THEN THEN BECAUSE INATE SILVER TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT IT HAPPEN THE I VERY ANGRIED HIM TO NATE SILVER HAS A GREAT PIECE OVER AT HIS WEBSIDE NATESILVER DOTNET IN WHICH HE BREAKES DOWN THE PROBLEM IN THESE POLES FOR JOBIDON HE SAYS S DEMOCRATS USUALLY ASSUME THE WIN ELECTIONS THROUGH TURN OUT RATHER THAN PERSUASION IS NOT A CRAZY PROPORTION BY ANY MEANS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A LOOSING APPROACH FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FOR MOST OF RECENT HISTORY MORE AMERICANS I DENTIFIED TIS DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS THAT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T TRANSLATING TO DEMOCRATIC VICTORIES ONE HUNDRED PER CENTS OF THE TIME UNTIL RELATIVELY RECENTLY DEMOCRATS DID BETTER AMONG NON COLLEGE VOTERS THAN MONE COLLEGE GRADUATES MANY DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO RICH MI NORITIES WHO FACE STEEPER BARRIERS TO VOTING ET CETERA'S OUR BUT HE SAYS THAT TYPICALLY SPEAKING THIS HAS BEEN THE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY PARTICULARLY SINCE TWENTY TWELVE I'VE POINTED TISAU BEFORE DEMOCRAT'S FELL IN LOVE IN TWENTY TWELVE WITH THE BARAKOBMAMA THEORY WE DON'T NEED TO GLEFTER TH MEDIAN VOTER THE MEDIAN VOTER CAN BE SAFELY ABANDON ALL WE NEED IS OUR COALITION OF THE OPPRESSD AND SOME COLLEGUG TO GET A WHITE LIBERAL LADIES THAT'S ALL WE NEED NAT SILVER POINTS THAT OUT IT'S AD MIT ROMNY IN THE TWENTY TWELL ELECTION ACTUALLY ONE INDEPENDENT VOTERS BUT BECAUSE DEMOCRATS HAD A BIGGER BASE WITH THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF VOTERS IN THE NATIONAL EXIT IDENTIFYING HIS DEMOCRATS COMPARED TO THIRTY TO PER SEN REPUBLICANS BARAKABAMA ONE COMFORTABLY BUT AS ANATE SILVER POINTS OUT BAROKO BAMA'S COALITION CANNOT BE UP DATED FOR JOBIDON BAROKOBAMA WAS A CARISMATIC FIGURE BRAGOBAMO IS THE FIRST BLACK PRESEDEN JOBIDON IS AN OLD WHITE MAN WHO CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH ANY MORE AND SO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH JOBIDON IS THAT HE LIKE BAROKOBAMA IN TWENTY TWELVE HAS GIVEN AWAY THE MODERATES HE'S GIVEN THEM AWAY AS ANATE SILVER POINTS OUT WHEN IT COMES TO INDEPENDEN VOTERS IS A GREAT IT'S A GREAT THING TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU AREN'T INDEPENDENT VOTER AND YOU SWITCH YOUR VOTE ATSAVOTE BIDON IN TWENTY TWENTY A NIURE VOTING FOR TRUMP WHAT YOU JUST DID IS ACTUALLY WORTH TWICE WHAT A BASE VOTER SHOWING UP DID A BATES VODER SHOWING UT MEANS THAT THE BATES VOTALITA THEIR MARTIONAL VOTER DIDN'T VOT IN TWENTY TWENTY DID VOTIN TWENTY TWENTY FOURE SO LET SAY THE YOU HAV TWENTY PEOPLE WHO ARE VOTING AND THEN A MARGINALIZED VOTERS SHOWS UP IN VOTES FOR US TO NOW YOU AN ELEVEN TO TEN IT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS IF AN INDEPENDENT VOTER WHO VOTED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWITCHES LET'S SAY THAT IT WAS SPLIT TEN TO TEN THAT VOTER TAKES A VOTE AWAY FROM ONE SIDE AND GIVES IT TO THE OTHER CREATING A TWO VOTE MARGIAN INSTEAD OF NOW BEING ELEVEN ATTEN IT SHUST TO ELEVEN NINE SO AN INDEPENDENT VOTER IS ACTUALLY WORTH MORE IN TERMS A MARGIN OF VICTORY THEN JUST ANY PERCON WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR THAT THE THE DEMOCRATIC SIDEAND DIDN'T SHOW UP IN TWENTY TWENTY RAY SAYS THE UNDERLYING ARITHMETIC OF HOW VOTES ARE TALLY MEANS THAT FLIPPING O VOTERS WORTH TWICE AS MUCH AS TURNING A NON VOTER OUT PLUS THE COMPOSITION OF THE ELECTRIT HAS CHANGED DEMOCRATS HAVE LOST THEIR EDGE ON PARTY IDEE IN A LOT OF POLS THIS WHAT HAPPENED BY THE WAY IN THE STATE OF FLORITA WHICH IS NOW TURN BRIGHT RED THAT'S BECAUSE REPUBLICANS DID THE ON THE GROUN WORK OF GOING IN REGISTERING REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHICH MEANS THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT HAVE A BATES TURN OUT ADVANTAGE IN THE STATE OF FLORA PLUS IN DEPENDENTS TEN DEVOT REPUBLICAN IN THE STATE OF FLORITAS WHIC HIFTED RM REPURPLE STATE TO A VERY RED STATE SO AS NATESILVER POINTS OUT IN GALLOP PULLING THROUGHOUT TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE SAME PER CENTAGE FOR MARICANS IDENTIFI NOW AS DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN FORTY THREE PER CENT NOW ITA IDEAS INDEPENDENT WHICH MEANS INDEPENDEN VOTERS HO BE MORE IN PORTAN TO JOBINE BUT THAT'S WHO HE'S FORGOTTEN ABOUT SOS ONE THING TO SAM TO APPEAL TO THE BATE WHEN THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT VOTERS SAY THEIR DEMOCRATS AND THIRTY TWO PER CENTS SAY THE REPUBLICANS IS A WHOLE MOTHER THING WHEN TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE REPUBLICANS AND TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT PEOPLE SAY THE RE DEMOCRATS AND FORTY THREE PER CENT SAY NEITHER WHICH MEANS THE HATE BOTH CANDIDATES SO WHOSEGONA WINTHOSE PEOPLE NOW AS NATE SILVER POINTS OUT THE REALITY IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS WINNING THOSES PEOPLE GOING AWAY THE POLE FROM THE NARTIME SIENA ASKED VOTERS WHO THEY VOTED FOR IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN ASK THEM WHO THEY PLAN T VOTE FOR IN TWENTY TWENTY FORE SO BIZARLY THE POLE SHOWED THAT THE RECALLED VOTE IN O PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY VOTED IN TWENTY TWENTY WHAT THEY SAID WAS THAT THEY VOTED BY BIDON BY IT TWELVE POINT MARGIN NOW AGAIN THAT DEMONSTRATES THIS IS THIS ETULYA DEMOCRAT HEAVY POLE BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT JOBIDEN TEN NOUT WIN BY TWELVE PONTS JOBI ONE BY FOUR POINT FIVE PER CENT THAGE POINT BUT THEY SAY THAT THEY VOTED IN TWENTY TWENTY THIS VOTING BASE FIFTY THREE FORTY ONE FOR JOBIDON NOW ALL THOSE SANE VOTERS ASKED REGION VOTE FOR IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR SAID TRUMP FORTY EIGHT TO FORTY THREE WHICH MEANS BID AND LOST TEN POINTS OFF OF THE TWENTY TWENTY VOTE AMONG THESE VOTERS AND DONAL TRUMP GAINE SEVEN POINTS WHICH MAKE CENTS RIGHT NOT EVERYBODY WHO SHIFTED FROM BIDAN LOVES DONAL TRUMP BUT MOST OF THEM ARE WILLING TO VOTE FOR NONAL TRUMP SO AT HE SAYS IS THAT IN THE POLE ONLY EIGHTY THREE PER CENTS O VOTERS WHO SAY THEY CHOSE BIDEN AN TWENTY TWENTY PLAN VOTE FROM THIS YEAR NINETY SEVEN PER CENTS OF THOSE WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP PLANS VOTE FOR TRUMP AGAIN THOSE ARE SWING VOTERS PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO MOVE FROM ONE PARTY TO THE OTHER AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM AND THE POINTHENATE SILVER MAKES IS THAT FOR EVERY TEN VOTERS WHARE VOTING TO DONALD TRUMP FEWER THAN ONE ARE SWITCHING OVER TO JOBIDON FROM THE TRUMP CAMP IN OTHER WORDS DONALD TRUMP IS WINNING INDEPENDENCE RIGHT NOW AND THAT MEANS THAT HE IS LIKELY TO WIN THE ELECTION THIS POLD DATA BY THE WIGHT IS SUPPORTED BY FURTHER PULLING OVER THE WEEK EN FROM BOTH WALLSTREE JOURNAL AND SE BES NEWS ACCORDING TO A BRAND NEW S BES NEWS POLE WHEN ASKED HOW THEY WOULD RATE THE PRESIDENCIES OF DONALD TRUMP AND JOBIDON WHEN THE SAY DONALD TRUMP LOOKING BACK WAS IT EXCELENTS ARE GOOD OR FAIR OR POOR FORTY SIX PER CENT SAY EXCELLENTS OR GOOD FIFTY THREE PER CENTS A FAR OR POOR ABOUT DONAL TRUMP JOBIDON SO FAR ONLY THORTY THREE PER CENTS AY EXCELLENT OR GOOD SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT SAVE FAIR OR POOR WHEN THEY LOOK BACK ON THE ECONOMY SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE POLD IN THE SE BES POLE WHICH BY THE WAY SHOWS TRUMP UP FIFTY TWO FORTY EIGHT OVER JOBIDON SIXTY FIVE PER CENT SAY THAT DONALDTRUMPS ECONOMY WASGOOD COMPARED TO TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT WHO SAY THT IT WAS BAD N THE SE BS POLE JOBIDEN THIRTY EIGHT  PER CENT SAY THE ECONOMY IS GOOD AS PPOST TO FIFTY NINE PER CENT WHO SAY THAT THE ECONOMY IS BAD AND AGAIN A HUGE PER CENTAGE OF THIS IS ABOUT IN FLATION FIFTY FIVE PER CENTS REGISTERED VOTERS SAY THET JOBIDON'S POLICIES MAKE THE PRICES GO UP AS PPOSET TO THIRTY FOUR PER CENT WHO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMPS POLICIES CREATED IN FLATION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY DIDN'T NOW AGAIN THESE ARE DISASTER NUMBERS FOR JOBIDON AND ISSUE BY ISSUE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HOW JOBIDON WINS THE SELECTION UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MOST DEMOCRATS ARE DIS HARTENED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SELECTION CYCEL BY THE WAY SO ARE MOST REPUBLICANS IT TURNS OUT THAT MOST PEOPLE GENERALLY ARE NOT SUPERHAPPY ABOUT THE CANDIDATES THEY HAVE BUT THEY ARE WAY UNHAPPIER WITH JOBIDON WHY BECAUSE THEIR THEIR HOPES WERE DISAPPOINTED JOBIDON ACTUALLY HAVE POINTED THE TOUNT MANY TIMES WHEN JOBIDON CAME INTO OFFICE HIS APPROVAL RATING WAS INTHE MID FIFTIES CLOST TO SIXTY PER CENT HE IS NOW DOWN IN THE FORTIES WHEN DONALD TRUMP ENTERED OFFICE HIS APPROVAL RATING WAS A LIKE FORTY EIGHT PER CENT AND WHEN HE LEFT OFFICE HIS APPROVAL RATING WAS LIKE FORTY THREE PER CENT IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR TRUMP AND THEN THOSE HOPES MIGHTAE BEN MILDLY DISAPPOINT HAT 'M NOT TALK ABOUT REPUBLICANS SOMETIME OUT THE GENERAL VOTING BASE JOBIDON CAME INTO OFFICE ON THE WINGS OF EAGLES AND THEN HE PROCEEDED TO DRIVE THE PLAYING DIRECTLY INTO THE GROUND FOR HIMSELF ACCORDING TUE THIS SE BES NEWSPOLE MOST OF BIDON'S VOTERS FIELD THE ELECTION IS MOSTLY ABOUT STOPPING TRUMP MOST OF TRUMPS VOTERS SAY THAT THEY ARE VOTING TRUMP BECAUSE THEY LIKE HIM NOT BECAUSE THEY HATE JOBIDON SO DEMOCRATS NDON LOVE WITH JOBIDON MANY SWITCHING OVER TRUMP DISASTER AREA FOR JOBIDON AGAIN WHILSTR JOURNALPOLE SAME SAME DATA TO DAY TRUMP UP FORTY SEVEN FORTY PIVE VOTERS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE UP EAT ON THE ECONOMY BUT THEY DON'T CREDITED TO JOBIDON THE'RE SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENING IN SPITE OF JOBIDON AN UNDERLYING ALL OF THIS OF COURSE IS THE SIMPLE FACT THAT JOBIDON IS JUST TOO OLD THAT EVERY POLE SHOWS A HUGE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE INCLUDING HUGE M MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS THINK JOBIDON IS NO LONGER WITH US BECAUSE HE'S NOT AND HERE'S THE THING THAT IN'T CON REVERSE ITSELF JOBIDON COULD REVERSE HIMSELF POSITIONALLY HE COULD THEORETICALLY START TO EMBRACE MODERATION ON THE BORDER HE COULD THEORETICALLY START TO EMBRACE MODERATION ON SPENDING HE COULD THEORETICALLY ALAW FOR EXAMPLE IS TROLD TO DEFEAT COMMASS AND STAND UP AGAINST COMOSNEXT IN HIS OWN PARTY HE COULD DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THAT MIGHT MARGINALLY CHANGE THE TROJECTORY OF THE RACE BUT IN THE END PEOPLE TEN TO BOAT BASTED ON WHO THEY SEE IN FRONT OF THEM AND WHAT THEY SEE IS A CORPSE WHAT THEY SEE IN JOBIDEN IS AN ACTUAL DEAD PERSON AND I TURNS OUT THAN AMERICANS IN TWENN TWENTY THEY WERE PROMISE HE STAYED SOBER AD MINISTRATION THE ADULTS BACK IN CHARG AND IF THE GID WAS SLIGHTLY SEE NI'L OK AND IT TURNS OUT HE JUST A CRAZY OLD MAN WHO RANS AT THE MOON AND WALKS INTO WALLS WELL GRUEL FALLS OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND THAT'S NOT A GREAT LOOK BECAUSE NOW THERE BEING ASK TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CRAZY ON ONE HAND WHICH IS HOW AMERICANS PERCEIVED DONAL TRUMP AND CRAZY AND SEE NILE IN JOBIDON BECAUSE AGAIN JOBIDON  MOVE TYOU FIRE THE LEFT IT WAS ONE THING TO SAY I'M A HOUSE PLANT RIGHT THIS WAS HIS CLAIM HE'S A HOUSE PLANT HIDING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY RATICAL WATERSTANE AT'S WHAT NEWS THEREFORS BIG WATERSTANE RIGHT DOWN ON THE CARPET TAKE PRESIDENT HOUSE PLANT PUT HIM ON THE WATER STAN ALL YOUR PROBMS ARE SOLVED AND THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT THE HOUSEPLANT IS LEAKY AND'S MAKING WATERSTANS SIGNIFICANTLY BIGGER AND MOST AMERICANS PARTICULARLY SWING VOTERS DO NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL AND ALL OF THAT JUST REINFORCE HIS FEELINGS ABOUT HIS AGEAND HE AIN'T GETTIN YOUNGER THAT'S THE ONE THING HE CAN'T REVERSE DON'T CARE HOW MUCH CRAP YOU SHOOTIN TO THAT GUY THAT DUD IS DEAD AND HE I MEAN PHYSICALLY HE IS NO LONGER WITH US AND IT'S OVIT IT'S THE MORE YOU SEE OF HIM THE WORSE IT GETS AND IRE'S A BIG PROBLEM FOR JOBIDOEN TE MORE OF DONALD TRUMP YOU SEE THE MORDONAL TRUMP YOU SEE I'VE SAID THIS SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN DONALD TRUMP IS A MUD MONSTER THE MORE MUD YOU THROW AT HIM THE MORE HE JUST BECOMES FULL OF MUD JOBIDON EVERY TIME HE GOES OUT HE HURTS HIMSELF EVERY TIME HE'S ON CAMERA HE AND AND EVERYTHIME HE'S NOT ON CAMRA HE HURTS HIMSELF BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT HE'S HIDING YOU CAN PLAY A BASEMENT STRATITY WHENYOU'RE NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND I FACT THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMPET SHOULD DO IN THIS CAMPAIGN JOBIDEN CANNOT PLAY THE BASEMENT STRATEGY HE'S THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND SO IS THE GUNS ARE STARTING TO OPEN UP EVEN FROM THE LEFT ON JOBIDOEN SEE GAN SEE IT'S EVERY DAY EVERY SINGLE DAY THE BIT ADMINISTRATION HAS TO TROT OUT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT JOBIDIN TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY THAT BURNE IS ALIVE THAT THE CORPSE IS ACTUALLY ALIVE AND IT'S NOT WORKING BECAUSE FIRST RULE OF POLITICS IF YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT YOU ARE NOT THE THING YOU'RE DEFINITELY THE THING S WHEN YOU SEND OUT ALEHONDRA MARKUS TO TALK ABOUT HOW BRIGHT AND WITH IT YOU ARE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BUT THEN YOU WALK OUT AND YOU BASICALLY ARE STUMBLING AROUND BUMBLING AROUND WELL IT MAKES YOUR PEOPLE LOOK LIKE BOTH LIARS AND AND ALSO POLITICAL HAKSERE'S ALEHONDRO MERICAS BEING BOTH I I TAN TI THIS ART TAT THE  TH TIAS THEY TRY TO MAKE A POINT THAT THERE IS

MOVY LIKE THE LAST JEDDI ANDYOU MAKE AN ABSOLUTELY INTORMINABLY AWFUL CHARACTER LIKE RODS AND THEN WHEN THE AUDIENCE DOESN' LIKE THE MOVY YOU SAY WELL IT'S BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T LIKE ASIAN PEOPLE IN STAR WARS THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN A GIANT FAIL FOR HOLLYWOOD BECUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT RIPPING THE AUDIENCE IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO COMES TO YOUR MOVIES AND ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T WHN YOUR FRIENDS DOESN'T WHEN YOU AN AND DOESN'T MAKE IN MOVIES BETTER AND IT ALSO BLINDS YOU TO THE REALITY WHICH I THAT YOU NEED TO COURSE CORRECT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR ON MOVIES BECAUSE YOU END UP JUST DOUBLING DOWN ON STUPID IF YOU KEEP BLAMING THE AUDIENCE OVER AND OVER AND OVER THEN YOU'RE JUST GIN TO KEEP MAKING THE SAME CRAPPY MOVY EIGHTY SEVEN TIMES INARO AND EVERY TIME IT FAILS YOU INISTATES NOT ME IT'S THE AUDIENCE THEY WELL JO BIDON IS DOING THAT RIGHT NOW AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM IS DOING THAT RIGHT NOW DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED THAT IT'S NOT JO IT'S YOU THIS IS A STRATEGY FOR FAILURE AND TO THE MEDIA WAS REPLETE OVER THE WEEK END WITH MEMBERS OF LEFT SUGGESTING THAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS VOTING AMERICANS THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE INSANE INSIPIDITY FOOLISHNESS OF THE NORMAL VOTING AMERICAN THE NORMAL VOTING MERICAN JUST DOESN'T GET IT THEIR RACIST THEI'R SEXIST THEIR TERRIBLE THEI'R THREATS DEDEMOCRACY SO FOR EXAMPLE AMASAND B C WHICH IS THE REPOSITORY OF THIS ENTIRE STRATEGY HAT ON A UNIVERSITY OF MERILAND POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR N AM TOMA SHALLER WHO PROMPTLY EXPLAINED THE WHITE RUALE VOTERS ARE IT ARE A THREAT DEMOCRACY NOW WHAT A NORMAL POLITICAL PARTY WOULD DO IS SAY WHY ON'T WINNING WHITE RURAL VOTERS WHAT ARE THEYR CONCERNS PERHAPS WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THOSE AND MAKE BE GEVE SOME CROP MAYBE WE DON'T MAYBE THE'RE A GENDA DOESN'T CROSS OVER WITH OURS AT ALL WHICH IS CAN AFORE GO THEIR VODS THA'S WHAT A NORMAL POLITICAL PARTY WOULD DO THIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS DECIDED IF WHITE RULE VOTERS WE'LL NOT VOTE FOR JOBIDON WHICH BY THE WAY IS THE REASON YOU 'S NOMINATE IT'S BECAUSE THE IDEA WATS WHO'S GOIN A CUT INTO DONALD TRUMPS WHITE RURAL VOTING BASE AND BY THE WAY HE DID IF YOU LOOK STATISTICALLY SPEAKING DONAL ROM ACTUALLY UNDER PERFORMED AND RULE AREAS AND OVER PERFORMED IN URBANARYAS IN TWENTY TWENTY SUN CTUALL WORK FOR JOBIDON THEN HE PROMPTLY ABANDONED THOSE PEOPLE AND NOW THEY'RE RELEGATED TO SAYING THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE RACES FASCHOS NOTS ESE OUT MISTAKES WHY ARE WHITE RORL VOTERS ATHRACT O DEMOCRACY THAT'S FIGHT HE WOULD THINK AS WE POINTED OUT THE LOOKING AT CO BIDAN'S FACK CROND AND DOTTLE TRUNPS THAT THAT THE OPPOSITE WENT PICTROU I MA WE LAY OUT THE FOURFOLD INTERCONNECTED THRAT THAT WHITE WORL VOTERS POST COUNTRY FIRST OF ALL AND WE SHOW THIRTY POLES AND NATIONAL STUDIES T DEMISTRATE THIS WE PROVIDE THE RECEIPTS IN CHAPTERCY THEY ARE THE MOST RASIST ZENOPHOBIC ANTI EMIGRANT ANTI GA GEODEMOGRAPHIC GROUP IN THE COUNTRY SECOND THEY'RE THE MOST CONSPIRACYS CROUP CU ANON SUPPORT AND SUBSCRIBERS ELECTION DENIALISM COVE DENIALISN S  SCIENTISSCEPTICISM OBOMABERTERS THIRD ANTI DEMOCRATIC SENTIMENTS THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN AN INDEPENDENT PRESS FREE SPEECH THEY'R MOST LIKELY STAY THE PRESENT SHOULD BE OF THAT YOU KNOW LATTERLY WITHOUT ANY CHECKS FROM CONGRESS OR THE COURTS OR THER BEROCRACY THEY ARE ALSO THE MOST STRONGLY WHITE NATIONALISTS AND WHITE CHRITIAN NATIONALISTS AND FORTH THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO DISEXCUSE OR JUSTIFIE VIOLENCE AS AN ACCEPTABL ALTERNATIVE TO PEACEFUL PUBLIC JUST SO THEY'RE ALL MAZIS O CASE OF THIS AGAIN IF YOU ATUY WERE TO LOOK AT THE DATA ON US WHAT YOUWOULD SEE IS THAT THE DATA TEND TO SUGGEST THAT AE FAIRLY SMALL MINORITY OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVE ALL THE THINGS THAT THIS PERSON JUST SET HE SAYS THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY SUBGROUP IN THE UNITED STATES TO BELIEVE THIS T DOESN'AT MEAN THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHITE RULE VOTERS ROMATIES BUT EVEN IF THAT WERE TRU THE REALITY IS THA IF YOU WANT TO WIN AN ELECIIN PRESUMABLY YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOME COMMANETT LIKE I'VE JUST YELL AT THEM YOU'RE ICAN WIN THEIR VOTES PRETTY OBVIOUSLY AND AGAIN THIS IS SOBAZAR BECAUSE BILL CLINTONS INTIR PITCH IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND NINETEEN NINETY SIX IS THAT HE WAS GOING TO WIND THOSE VOTERS THAT ALSO HAPPENING THE PITCHER FOR EXAMPLE HOWARDENE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND THEN IT WAS THE PITCH ONCE AGAIN OF ACTUALLY BAROCO BOMA IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HE WENT AFTER A LOT OF THOSE VOTERS BUT DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED THAT SINCE TWENTY TWELVE THERE'S CGONO ABANDON THAT VOTING BASE AND THEN IF THEY LOSE THERE JUST CON A CALL EVERY ONE THAT IS TREG WITH NOZIES WHICH OF COURSE REINFORCES THE ENTIRE REACTIONARYS SWIING THE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW BA YO UNGER SARGAN WHO IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE RIGHT WIY AND NOBA YE VERY NICE PERSON BAYA IS ALSO A GOOD POLITICAL ANALIST FROM THE LAFT AND CHOOSE ON BOMAR AND THEYE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND SHE SAYS THE PROMEMFOR JOBIDAN IS NOT THAT HE IS LOSING HIS BASE IS WHAT THE STATS SHOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT WORKING CLASS VOTERS DO NOT LIKE HIM THEY FEEL HE HAS ABANDONED THEM AND WHEN YOU JUST RIP INTO VOTERS HA TURNS OUT THEY DON'T LIKE YOU VERY MUCH SHU DEREGATS BE WORRIED ABOUT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNCOMMITTED VOTES IN THE MICIGAN PRIMARAIAS THE RED ABAT THIS WIL PROTEST VOTES OFEBY POLICYIN TOS E COSE IN THE ELECTIIN THE FO OTEA THOGTS UM I THINK THAT THE MENIA REALLY REALLY WANTS T PUT THIS NARRATIVE OUT THERE THAT BY IN IS GENO LOSE MICHIGAN OVER GAZO IN TE TRUTH AS HE'S GOING TO LOSE MICHIGAN OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AUTO WORKERS BECAUSE HIS E V MARKET WAS EXTREMELY PUNISHING TO AUTO WORKERS AND LIKEWE SENT EARLIER THERE'S BEEN THIS BIG REALINEMEN WHERE WORKING CLASS AMERICANS ARE VERY VERY VERY MUCH ON THE TRUMP TRAIN PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE DEMOCRATS AND USED TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS AND RATHER THAN ADMIT THAT THIS OUTRAGES THAT DEMOCRATS LOST THE WORKING CLASS VOTE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN APPEAL TO THEM AGAIN A THEY'RE LOOKING FOR EXCUSES AND OTHER THINGS TO BLAME LIKE O THIS FLORING GOSOR THEY'LL CALLD THEM DEPLORABLES OR THEY'R CALLED THEM RACESTS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT ADMIT THAT TRUMP HAS PICKED UP A LOT OF THE POLICIES THAT USED TO BE DEMOCRATIC POLICIES IN THE NINE THESE LIKE CONTROLLING THE BORDER FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA THAT AN OPEN BORDER AND MASS MIE GRATION IS EXTREMELY PUNISHING TO THE WORKING CLASSIC DRIVES DOWN THEIR WAGES IT'S CLASS WARFARE AGAINST THE WORKING CLASS IT IS AN UPWARD TRANSFER WEALTH FROM THE WORKING CLASS WENT OF COMPETING WITH HE MO GRANTS TO THE ELEDE TO AND UP INPLOYING THEM AND NOW THEY CAN EMPLOYED SHEEP EMOGRANTS INSTED OF HAVING TO PAY WORKING CLASS AMERICAN LIVING WAY SHE IS TOTALLY RIGHT SHE IS TOTALLY RIGHT AND DEMOCRATS USED TO OWN THAT CROWD AND NOW THEY'VE GIVEN UP THAT CROWD AGAIN WHAT THE POLES ARE SHOWING IS THAT JOBIDEN THE ENTIRE MEDAL OF THE COUNTRY WHAT WE ARE WATCHING WHAT WHAT THE SELECTION COULD BE WE NOT GUARANTEED STILL VERY EARLY YOU COULD BE WATCHING A POLITICAL REALINEMENT IN REAL TIME AND DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNIFY IN ENTIRELY MINORTY BASE WITH SOME WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED LADIES THAT WAS THE TWENTY TWELVE BASIN THEY WERE JUST GOING TO REPLICATED OVER AND OVER THE DIRTY SECRET OF TWENTY TWENTIES THAT JOBID N ACTUALLY CARVED INTO SOME OF THE BLUE COLLAR BAYS THE DONALD TRUMP OWNED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN TWENTY TWENTY FOURSE CAN LOSE AL THOSE PEOPLE NOT ONLY CAN LOSE ALL THOSE PEOPLE IT TURNS OUT THAT BELIEVE IT OR NOT  DEMOGRAPHICS IS NOT NECESSARILY DESTINY IT TURNS OUT THAT HISPANIC VOTERS MAY IN FACT TURN OUT IN LARGER NUMBERS THEN CERTAINLY USUAL FOR DONALD TRUMP ONE THIRTY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT VOTE THE LAST COUPLE LACH INTYCLES HE COULD WHIN FORTY TO FORTY FIVE PER CENT IN THE SELECTION CYCLE IF YOU GET TWENTY PER CENT OF TH BLACK VOT THAT IS DOUBLE WHAT ANY RE PUBLICAN HAS RECEIVED FOR GENERATIONS THAT COULD HAPPEN TOO YOU COULD BE WATCHING IN ACTUAL REAL LINEMENT NOT CAUSED AGAIN BY DONAL TRUMP IT REAL LINEMENT CAUSE BY THE FAILURS OF JOBIDEN BECAUSE HE DECIDED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE A HISTORIC PRECEDENT AND HIS EAGLE OVERTOOK HIM HIS EAGLE MADE HIM THINK HE WAS GOING TO BE L B J OR FT R BUT THE DIRTY SECRET ABOUT L B J AN AFT R IS THY HAD THE WHITE WORKING CLASS ON THEIR SIDE YOU KNOW WHO THE DEMOCRATS CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE BECASE THE'VE SEPARATED THEM OFF FROM THE PRIORITIES OF THEIR PARTY THE WHITE WORKING CLASS IT'S A REAL PROBLEM FOR THEM AN IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP AND EVERYBODY WHO'S LOOKING AT THE ECONOMY CAN SEE THIS HAPPENING FOR EXAMPLE FASCINATING ARTICLE N YOU CA DAILY MAIL TO DAY SUYS TACX PAY ER FUNDED GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAMS THAT HAND STRUGGLING FAMILIES SUP TO THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH NO STRINGS ATTACH ARE BEING ROLLED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO THE UCADAILY MAL THE SCHEMES WHO'S TOTAL VALUE EXCEEDS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIE MILLION DOLLARS HAVE STORGED IN POPULARITY SINCE THE PANDAMIC AS PROGRESSIVE LEADERS EM BRACE CASH HAND OUTS TO SUPPORT AMERICANS BELOW THE POVERTY LINE BUT THE RADICAL PROJECTS AVE BEN CRITICIZED HAF TER EMERGE THAT ONE MOTHER OF THREE IN WASHINGTON DOCY SPEND MORE THAN HALF OF THE TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS LUMP SOME PAYMENT ON A LUXURY HOLIDAY TO MAAME ALONG WITH THE NEW WARDROPE FOR A GIDS AND A GLOW UP FOR HERSELF THIS SORT OF STUFF IS QUITE REMINISCENT OF THE SORT OF WELFARE QUEEN RETORIC OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES YOU COULD BE WATCHING THE REMAKING OF THE RAGAN COALITION IN REAL TIME BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ARE TERRIBLE AT THIS MEANWHILE JOBITON IS RACKING UP DEBT AT SUCH AN EXORBITANT PACE OF THIS POINT THAT THERE IS NO WAY OUT BUT THROUGEH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO TWO THING SIMULTANEOUSLY ONE CUT SPENDING AND FIGUR OUT THE HELDYD WITH ENTITLEMENTS TAND TWO GROW THE ECONOMY LIKE GANGBUSTERS NOBODY BELIEVES THAT YOUR BIDON IS GOING TO DO EITHER OF THOSE THINGS AND SO WHAT YOUR LOOKING AT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A FAIRLY SERIOUS LONG TERM SECULAR STAGNATION SECULARGIUS MEETING ACROSS THE ENTIRE ECONOMY NOT INTO ANY ONE INDUSTRY A SECULAR STAGNATION ACCORDING TO A WARTON PROFESSOR NAMED HOGOMES HE SAYS THAT THEE THIRTY FOR SHRILLION DOLLAR DEBT BURDEN OF THE UNITED STATES COULD UPSET THE WORLD FINANCIAL MARKETS IS EARLY AS NEXT YEAR ESPECIALLY IF A PRESIDENTELLECT ANNOUNCES A RAFT OFE EXPENSIVE POLICIES WHELL YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOUBIDAN IS GOING TO DO HE KEEP SAYING IT OVER AND OVER THAT HE WANTS MORE EXPENSIVE POLICIES WHICH OF COURSE WAND MKE IT DIFFICULT FOR AMERICA TO RAISE MOR DEBT MEANWHILE THE BY DEMINISTRATION IS PURSUING THE WORLD'S WORST EMIGRATION POLICIES WOA BOUT YE CETERA THERE ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU ARE NOW HAVING A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT IS IMPORTING CHEAP LABOR IN ORDER TO HELP BUSINESS ALLIES THAT IS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THRUGH THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE CASE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS TO PROP UP THE INFLACIONARY ECONOMY WITH DEFLATIONARY WAGES THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU GET TO DEFLATION THE WAY YOU GET THAT DEFLATION IS BY LOWERING THE WAGE BURDEN SO DEMOCRATS HAVE REAL PROBLEM IF THEY WANT IN FLACIONARY ECONOMY THEY NEED UNIONS RIGHT IS WHAT THE IF YOU WANT IF YOU IF YOU WANT UNION POWER THAT INFLATES WAGES ARTIFICIALLY ANDTHE BY DEMINISTRATION WORKS WITH THE UNIONS BUT A TE SAME TIME YOU CAN'T LET THE UNIONS DOMINATE TH LABOR BASE BECAUSE IF THEY DO IS GOING TO INFLATE THE CURRENCY SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BRING IN A SUB WAGE LABOR BASE YOUEVE TO BRING THEM IN AND HAVE THE MORKY LEGALLY SO THE SAME TIME THEY ARE PUSHING THE UNIONS TOWERE YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES THYCAN MAKE THEIR MONEY AND THEN SPEND THAT MONEY ON YOU GETTNG ELECTED YEF TO BRING IN A LABOR BASE THATS HAC TOGIN A LOWER PRICES FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICAN CONSUMERS WHICH IS WHAT SHEAP LABOR DOES FROM ME LEGAL IMMIGRATION THE PROBLEM IS THAT AMERICANS CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN REAL TIME IN TEY DO NOT LIKE IT BY THE WAY THE'S AMAZING THE BY DEMINISTRATION IS NOW STARTING TO OPENLY ADMIT HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO AXIOS MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION A SYLUM SEKERS AND OTHER MIGRANTSWILL BE LIVING INSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN LEGAL LIMBO BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER THT IS A ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT T IN CREASE IN FIVE YEARS ALONE THAT'S INSANE THEY'RE ONLY THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHE'RE LIVING INSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN LEGAL LIMBO HOAD NOT HAD TO HEARING OR WHATEVER AS OF TWENTY NINETEEN IT IS NOW UP TO EIGHT MILLION THE BACKLOG HAS ABSOLUTELY EXPLODED UNDER JOBIDON AND THAT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN AGH FUNDING FOR THE BORDER CAURTS IT IS BECAUSE JOBIDON HAS OPENED THE BORDER WIDE AND GIVEN EVERYBODY A DATE CERTAIN TO COME BACK BY AND NO ONE SHOWS UP AGAIN AND AS THE WALLSTRY JOURNAL POINTS OUT THISNIS IS OUR LONG MORE ON MIGRAL WORKERS AS LABOR SHORTAGES PERSIST ACCORDING TO THE WALSTRY JOURNAL THEPENDENTS ON IMPORTED WORKERS IS APPROACHING ON HEALTHY LEVELS IN SOME PLACES STIFLING PRODECTIVITY GROWTH HELPING BUSINESS IS TE LAY THE SEARCH FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS TO LABOR SHORTAGES SO AGAIN JOBIDO HAS MADE THIS ENTIRE PROBE AND AS WOU CAN TINUE E IN TA TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE NEVER EVEN TOOK A CALL FROM HIS BOR CHIEF FOR LIKE THREE YEARS WE GETS THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST ONE YEAR AGO HERSY'S ANNOUNCE THAT A MAN WEU BE LEADING T THEIR WOMEN'S DAY CAMPAIGN WE ALL ROLLD OUR EYES WE TOUGHT WE'D HAVE TO BUY FROM YET ANOTHER COMPANY TH BELIEVES THAT MEN CAN BE WOMEN WELL WE HER AT THE DAILY WIRE HAD A DIFFERET IDEA IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE LUNCH JEREMY'S CHOCOLATE BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE ABLETO BY DELICIOUS CHOCOLATEFROM ACCOMPANY THE CHAIRS OR VALUES NOW JERMY'S CHOCOLATE IS TURNING ONE YEAR OLD ALL OUR LITTLE BABY IS GROWING UP TO CELEBRATE MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET YOURSELF SOME JEREMYS CHOCOLATE AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE SOME HE HIM WITH NUTS AND THEN WE HAVE SHE HER WITHOUT NUTS BECAUSE THAT'S BOTH THE WAY THE CHOCOLATE WORKS AN ALSO HUMAN VIOLOGY IT ALSO COMES IN MICRO OGGRESSION SIZE GET YOURS AT JEREMES CHOCOLATE DOT COM TO DAY WELL CAME MEANWHILE AND SO THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO MAKE THE CLAIM THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE NOT AT FAULT FOR WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE BORDER BUT THEY HAVE A RATHER LARGE PROBLEM WITH THAT THAT OF COURSE IS THAT THEY ARE CLEARLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER SO FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF RO OR TEES WAS ON SIXTY MINUTE THIS UNDER JOBIDON H WAS THE BORD PATRAL CHIEF HE SAYS HE NEVER TALKED TO JOBIDON YAH THIS MIGHT BE THE FAULT OF BIE ADMINISTRATION IN OUR INTERVIEW OR TEASE CRITICIZED GOVERNOR ABBOT FOR NOT COOCERAT WITH A BORDER PATROL AND CLAIM POLITICS OR IMMIGRATION BUT HE ALSO EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION WITH PRESIDENT BIDON I'VE NEVER HAD ONE CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT OR THE WISE PRESIDENT FOR THAT MATTER AND SO I WAS THE CHIEF OF THE BORBETU I COMMANDED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT'S A PROBLEM YES YES IT IS HOW MUCH OF A PROBEM IS THIS FOR THE BI ADMINISTRATION BUT THE ATTACK HATS HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED THIS ON BE A SUPERUGLY ELECTION PSYCHOL EVERY ONE IS THIS ONES CONPARTPICULARLY UGLY ESPECIALY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ANYBAY TO LIKE YOUR CANDIDATE PEOPLE WHO LOVE TRUMPL OF TRUMP EVERYBODY ELSE MEAN PEOPLE WHO LOVE BIDON DON'T EXIST SO THAT MEANS THAT THIS ELECTION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT TEARING DOWN THE OPPOSITION AS HE USUALLY IS AND THIS A TARGET RICH ENVIRONMENT FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BECAUSE JOBIDON THERE AR CERTAIN CERTAINLY ON EMIGRATION YOU CAN CLEARLY IDENTIFY VICTIMS OF JOBIDON'S EMIGRATION POLICY ONE OF THOSE VICTIMS IS LAKE AN RILY WEY CAN RILY OF COURSE WAS MURDERED JUST LAST WEEK AT UNIVERSITY OF JEORGA AND TOM THE RESPONSE OF THE LOCAL MAYOR WAS TO CL AIM THAT THIS WAS THE FAULT OF DONAL TRUM SHE WAS MURDERED ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SHE WAS JOGGING AND HER BODY WAS FOUND NEAR A LAGABLE WOODED AREA HER DELF WAS CAUSED BY BLUNT FORCE DROMA THE PERSON ARRESTED WAS OF COURSE ANELEGLIMEGRAN ELHONDR MEORICAS WAS ASKED DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS LOOK AT THE WAY THAT HE DEALS WITH US THIS A DISASTER FOR HE MY ADMINISTRATION A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD NURSING STUDENT I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOING THUS A LAKAN RILY IN THE STATE OF GEORGEI WAS MURDERED A LEGEDLY A BY AN UNDOCUMENTED VENISWAILAND MIGRAN THE SUSPECT HAD BEEN DETAINED BY PORTER PATROL UPON CROSSING RELEASED WITH TEMPORARY PERMISSION TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY HE THEN WENT ON A LEGIDLATE TO COMMIT CRIMES A TWICE ONCE IN NEW YORK FOR DRIVING A SCHOOTER WITHOUT LICENSE AND ONCE IN CONNECTION WITH A SHOP LIFTING CASE IN GEORGIA DID THOSE STATES AND THEIR LAW IN FORCEMEN COMMUNICATE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT THAT THIS HAD HOPPENED SHOULD THIS MAN HAVE BEEN DEPORTED A A FEW THOUGHTS FIRST MARGARET FIRST AND FOREMOST AND ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY AND OUR HEARTS BREAK FOR AND OUR PRAYERSOR WITH THE FAMILY NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO AND IMPORTANTLY AS A PROSECUTOR HAVING PROSECUTED VILENT CRIME AND OTHER CRIMES FOR TWELVE YEARS ONE INDIVIDUAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER AND THAT IS THE MURDERER AND WE WORK VERY CLELVELY WITH STATE AND LOCAL LAWN FORSEMEN TO INSURE THAD INDIVIDUALS WHO POSED U THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY ARE INDEED OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR DETENTION AND REMOVEL O YET THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM OF THAT WHICH OF COURSE IT'S NOT TRUE TRUE PERSENGENTEMEN IN THE COUNTRY IN THE FIRST PLACE SANCTUAROSEV POLLICIES ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES HAVE ALLOWED CAREER CRIMINALS TO STAY IN PLAY THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SOFT ON CRIME AND SO THEY GOT A REAL PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS MERICAS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON'T GOING TO SOLVE ANYTHIN WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE IT IS JOBIDE'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS UPON COMING INTO OFFICE THAT OPENED UP THE BORDER WIDE GIVEN THAT SEE AN ANDIS REPORTING LAST WEEK ATHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IT'S CONSIDERING EXECUTIVE ACTION THAT WOULD BLOCK MIGRANT CLAIMING ASYLUM IF THEY A LEGALLY CROSS INTO THE UNITED STATES CAN YOU TELL US EXACTLY WHAT'S ON THE TABLE CAN WE A CONSIDER OPTIONS AT ALL TIMES THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOOD GOVERNMENT BUT AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR AN ENDURING SOLUTION WHEN WE TAKE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS AS WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF TIMES WE ARE CHALLENGED IN COURT LEGISLATION IS THE ENDURING SOLUTION AND BY THE WAY WE CAN NOT THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION PLUS UP THE UNITED STATES PORT O PATROL CUSTOMS IN BORDOF PROTECTION BY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PERSONNEL LIKE THI LEGISLATION PROPOSES WE CANNOT THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AD FOR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ASYLUM OFFICERS SO THA WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE BACK LOG AND TURN THE SYSTEM INTO AN EFFICIENT AND WELL WORKING ONE WHICH IT HASN'T BEEN FOR MORE THAN THREE DECATES UM WELL YOU KO T YOU COULD DO YOU COULD PUT BACK IN PLACE DONAL TRUMPS REMAIN A MEXICO POLICY IN WHICH EVERYBODY WHO APPLIES FOR ASYLUM HAS TO NOT HE ENTERED INTO THE UNITED STATES AND THEY REMAIN IN MEXICO TO AWAIT THEIR ASYLUM DETERMINATION WHICH WOULD STOP HE VAST ONSLAUGHT ON THE BORDER AND THEN YOU COULD ALSO REDEFINE THE INTERPRETATION OF ASYLUM LAW SUCH THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU DESERVE ASYLUM TO BE LET INTO THE COUNTRY NOT MERELY SAY THINGS LIKE I FEAR TO GO BACK TO MY HOME COUNTRY THAT IS NOT ENOUGH AND MEAN WHAT BU HE DEMOCRATS WENT LIKE GO THIS THEY WON'T LET GO THIS AGAIN THEY'VE BEN CAPTURED BY THE RADICAL BASE AND SO THE THE SMART MOVE HERE OF COURSE WOULD BE TO MODERATE ON THE BORDER AND THEY WON'T DO IT TO CHRISTMURPHY WHISE A MEMBER OF THE WILD LEFT CONNECTICAT SENATOR WHO MAKES HIS APPEARANCE ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS PRETTY MUCH EVERY EVERY WEEK HE SAYS THAT WE CANNOT CHANGE SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES WHICH OF COURSE IS A LIE OF COURSICAN CHANGE SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES AND OF COURSE YOU SHOULD TURNS OUT THE PEOPLE GO TO SANCTUARY CITIES TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS AND MAGIC OF THE SANCTUARY CITY HIS HAT BELL THAT'S NOT A MAGNET OF COURSE IT IS IF BI BOUGT P BESINE HIM I DON'T OUT STORE TING FREE DONUTS FOR EVERY ONE I'M TO BE OUT DON'T UT PRETDAMNED QUICKLY HERE'S CHRISTMURPHY WE SAW W YORK MARE ADAMS ARE CALL FOR DRASTOC CHANGES TO ER CITYES SANCTUARY POLICIES AS AS THE WHOLE SANCTUARY CITY WOVEN TADIDT GO TOO FAR WE SEE THE ROLL BACK OF THAT SHOULD THERE BE A ROLL BACK OF THAT WELL YOU'L WE TREAT EMMIGRANTS COMPASSIONALLYN CONNECTICATE AS WELL UM AND THESL ITHINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE BEST OF THIS COUNTRY ULTIMATELY THI SOLUTION HAS TO BE ON THE BORDER AND IN THE COUNTRIES THE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING UM I DON'T THINK IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THIS COUNTRY TO PUSH EMMIGRANTS IN TO THE SHADOWS ONCE THEY ARE HERE SO TO ME THE FOCUS HAS TO BE ON THE BORDER THE FOKS HAS TO BEONTH BUT BUT THE WON'T DO ANYTHING AT THE BORDER WHICH IS WHY TOMAL TRUMP IS WINNING THE BORDER ISSUE BY TWENTY TO THIRTY POINTS IN THE PULLING DATA HERE'S NON A TRUMP OF THE WEEK AND GOING AFTER JOBIDON THIS MESSAGE IS GOING TO TELL IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO BODY DAMAGE TO THE BIN CAMPAIGN EVERY DAY JO BI IES GIVIN ADIN COMFOR TO THE FOREIGN ENEMIES OF THE UNITED SATES HE'S ACTUALLY GIVING AY AND THEY DON'T RESPECT US TATY MORE  A COUNTRY THREE YEARS AGO WE WERE MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE AND NOW THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR US WETSOEVER AN PUT YES THAT HIS TALKED ABOUT NEWCLEER DI D ER THAT RIGHT NEWCLYA HE WOULDN'T BE TALKED ABOUT NECLEAR BY WAY HERE HE WOULDN'T E CBY THE WAYGAND DIRTY LITTLE SECRET HERE IS NONTAL TRUMPIS OUTFLAKING CHOBIDN ON THE RIGHT WITH REGARD TO PENFERPUTON THE BOTTO LINE HERE IS THAT JOBINE IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE AND HE KEEPS HE IS OPERATING ON A COMPLETELY FALSE THEORY HERE HIS THEORY IT IS BELIE BY EVERY PIECE OF POLE DATA IS THAT THE BIGGEST PROBEM HE HAS IS BASE TURN OUT THAT IS NOT CORRECT I BIG IS PROBE THAT HE HAS THAT INDEPENDENCE AN MODERATES ARE ABANDONING M IN DROVES YOORNTIC A LOOK AT HA WE KNOW THIS JOHN FETTERMAN FOR EXAMPLE IS THE SENATOR IN PENNSYLVANIA JOHN FETTERMAN'S APBRUVALRATING IS THIRTEEN POINTS ABOVE WATER HE'S A VERY POPULAR SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA HE AS TAKEN THE MOST PROTE ISRAEL POSITION OF PRETY MUCH ANYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE JOBIDEN IS UNDER WATER IN PENNSYLVANIA HE COULD EASILY LOSE THE STATE HE'S RUNNING AT BEST DEAD EVEN WITH DONAL TRUMP IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA IT TURNS OUT THAT AMERICANS DON'T REALLY LIKE IT VERY MUCH ONE SAY YOU APPEASE TERRACE YOUR BASEMAY BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT MOST AMERICANS INCLUDING IN DEPENDENCE DO NOT NAY IS TE BIDAN ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SEND ALL THE WRONG SIGNALS IN THE MELEAST AGAIN IN AN ATTEMPT TDESPERATELY TO WIN  DEARBORN MICHIGAN AND IT AIN'T GOING TO HELP THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH VOTES IN DEARBORN MICHIGAN TO MAKE UP FOR THE FACT THAT HE'S LOSING THE WHITE WORKING CLASS IN STATES LIKE MICHINGAN IT'S WY JOBIDON IS IN TROUBLE BUT AGAIN THE DEMOCRATSV BEN TOTALLY CAPTURED BY THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE NER TIMES THEDITORYABOARD OF THE NARTIME'S GOT CAPTURE BY THE WOKE INTERNS AND THE MANS AREN OF CAPTURED TH BY DEMINSTRATION WHO SEEMS TO BELIEVE THATIF THEY JUST REPEAT JANUARY SIXTH ON ON BROADER AND LOUDER VOLUME THE MAGICALLY THERE CAN O WIN THIS ELECTION AND SO THEY ARE JUST CATERING TO THE COMASNACS IN DEARBORN AT MICHIGAN SO OVER THE WEAK END FOR EXAMPLE COMELA HARRIS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  SUGGESTED THEI'RE NEEDED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE SEASE FIRE IND GOSSIN NOW THE WHITE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO WALK THIS BACK ALOTLBET THEY TRY TO SAY T WHAT YOU MEANS THAT COMASS SHOULD AGREES WATH SEAS FIRE BECAUSE I TURNS OUT AWKWARDLIE OVER THE WEAK END ISRAEL AGREED TO MANY OF THE PRECONDITIONS FOR A SEASE FIRE AND COMOSS TURNED IT DOWN THE REASON COMAS TRM DOWNASEAS FIRE IS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THE WEST IS GOING TO FORCE ISRAEL TO STOP BWITHOUT COMS GIVING A POSSTAGES WITHOUT COMAS GOING INTOE EXILE WITH CMAS RETAINING CONTROL IN THE GOSSI STRIP BUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT CMASMIN GAINS CONTROL OF LESS BANK CMAS MAY NOT BE WRONG CONSIDERING THE PATHETIC LEFTISM OF OUR CURRANT CROP OF WESTERN LEADERSHIP BUT HERE IS COMELA HARRIS MAKING A FOOL OF HERSELF UN THIS ISSUED JUST YESTERDAY ANGE THE  ASTR GOATHERE MUST BEAND THE NEVERYS OKE THRE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM COMAS REJECTED THAT DEAL SO WHAT IS SHE ACTUALLY SAYING SO THE WHITE HOUSE TRIED TO SAY THAT WHAT SHE WAS SAYING WAS COMASNEAS TO ACCEPT THE SEAS FIRER BUT Y CAN HEAR THE CROWD THEY DON'T THINK UTS WHAT OMALA HARRIS MEANS AND COMAS KNOWS THAT THE MORE THIS AD MINISTRATION DOS P ARE FOR E SEAS FIRER THE MORE IT HELPS COMASS THEY KNOW THIS CRISMURPHY THET DULLERD FROM CONNACTICAT HE'S DOING THE SAME THING THERE IT WAS SUGGESTING THAT BIDN HAS USE ALL HIS LEVERS SHOULDGET TO ALONG FROM EAS FIRE LEVEREDGE ON WHOM ON WHOM I MEAN IT IT CAN BE LEVERS ON COMASS BECAUSE COMAS LEVERIDGE SDOS AN APPLY ISRAELS BOMBING THEM FORWARD INTO THE STONE AGE AND KILLING ALL THER MEMBERS AND THERE STILL MOT GIVING UP POWER SO WHAT EX ACTLY WITH THE LEVERIDGE BE OTHER THAN PRESUMABLY SOME SORT OF CKERROT FROM THE IS RAILIES THAT LEAVES COMAS IN POWER WHAT EXACTLY IS HE ADVOCATING HERE THAT THE MA GICOF OF IDIOTIC DIPLOMACIES THAT IT LIES IN VAGORY THAT'S THE MAGIC OF IDIOTICAL IVE JUST SAY WORDS LIKE SEASE FIRE THE MAGICALLY THEY MANIFEST I CARRY POTER IF YOU SAY THE RIGHT SPELL SEES PHIRO BEDYRO IF YOU SAY THAT SORT OF STUFF THEN MAGICALLY PEACE BREAKS OUT IT'S NONCENSE HERE'S CRISTMURPHY MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELF AS FOR OUR USUAL ARRANGEMENT  CAN WONA TURN TO WHAT WE SAWIN MICHICAN WERE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DEMOCRATS LEN TO THE POLES INVOTED NON COMMITTEED AH OBVIOUSLY A PROTEST VOTE TO THE PRESIDENTS HANDLING OF THE SITUATION IN GASA HOW CONCERNS AS A POLITICAL MATTER I SHOULD SHOULD DEMOCRATS BE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AS A POLITICAL MATTER BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A CRITICALL ISSUE RELATIVE TO AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE SECURITY OF THE MITL LEAST I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN GASAR THE MILL LEAST FASE UPON HOW THE VOTES LINED UP LISTEN I THINK IT IS TIME FOR THE PRESIDENCIES ALL THE LEVERS THAT HE HAS IM TO GET A LONG TERM SEASE FIRE I THINK IF THAT SYS FAR DOESN'T COME IT'S IN ISRAEL'S INTEREST FOR THEM TO POSSMILITARY ACTIVITY TO SOLVE THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BUT TO THE EXTENT THE PRESIDENT IS USING ADITIONAL LEVERAGE ON ISRAEL HE SHOULD DO THAT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS NOT FOR POLITICAL REASONS THESE ISSUES ARE TOO IMPORTANT TO BE DICTATED BY THE POLES IKES HAVE THAT THEY ARE BEING DICTATED BY THE BOLLS AND BECAUSE AGAIN JO BIDON CAVED RETORIC LANALOT OF THE STUFF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THEN PUSHED WAY THE LEFT NOW HE IS FOLLOWING AS HE ALWAYS DOES THE CENTER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACCORDING TO THIS BRANNUW WHILSTERGORNAL POLE SIXTEEN PER CENT OF REPUBLICANS ONLY SAY THAT ISRAEL HAS GONE TOO FAR IN RESPONDING TO COMASS SEVENTY PER CENT OF DEMOCRATS DO SEVENTY PER CENT FORTY PER CENT OF DEMOCRATS UNDER THE AGE OF FORTIES OF THE UNITED STATES WAS DOING TOO MUCH TO HELP ISRAILIES COMPARED WITH THIRTY THREE PER CENT OF DEMOCRATS AGED FORTY AND OLDER THE SAME POLE SHOWS BY THE WAY THAT OVER ALL FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS GIVING ABOUT THE RGHT AMOUNT OR TOO LITTLE SUPPORTS TO THE ISRAILIES ONLY THORTY PER CENT THINK THAT TOO MUCH SUPPORT IS BEING GIVEN TO THE ISRAILIES AND THAT OVER ALL SOME FORTY THREE PER CENT OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL HAS EITHER BEEN ABOUT RIGHT OR NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH SO A PLURALITY I SHOULD BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE BUT DEMOCRATS ARE ON THE WONG SIDE OF THEAMERICAN PUBLIC ON THIS AND THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO FLIP THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ON THIS EVEN AS COMAS EXASCERBATES THE PROBLEM COMAS IS STEALING AID SO THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE HELP OFTHE MEDIOHOMAS BECAUSE THE MEDIAN COMAS WORE CANNIN GLOVE IN FACT WHEN IT COMES TO THE COVERAGE O THE GOS'STRIP COMAS AN THE MEDIARE ONE IN THE SAME MANY MEMBERS OF THE MEDIOR COMAS FELLOW TRAVELERS WORKING HAND IND GLOV WITH COMAS UND TI WE'VE HARD THIS VAST BEVY OF STORTIES RECENTLY ABOUT HUMAN WRITES ABUSE IS WITH REGARD TO THE THE PROVISION OFT EID IN THE GOSSES TRIP THE BIG PROBLEM IS THERE IS NO ONE TO PROVIDE THE AID IN THE GOSES TRI BECAUS COMASS WON'T SURRENDER COMSIS HIGH JACKING THE AID THE PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING THE AID WHICH MEANS THAT ISRAEL HAS TO HIRER THIRD PARTY DRIVERS WERE EGYPT AND COTAR DU THOSE THORD PARTY DRIVERS ARE VERY OFTEN BEING HIGH JACKED HARMED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMAS CONTINGENT AS WELL S THE GASEN POPULATION THE ISRAILIES HAVE HUNDREDS OF TROKHS STACKED UP THE BORDER AND THERE IS NO ONE TO TAKE THEM IN THERE IS NO ONE WHO IS WILLING TO DRIVE THEM IN AND DISTRIBUTE THE AID BECAUSE IT A BLEAPSHO VER THERE CAUSE KOMS WON'T SREBYAGAIN ALL THE TEND THE MINUTE THEKAMAS SURRENDERS IS BEENG POINTED OUT BY THE SPOKES PERSON FOR THE IDIEF ALONLAVY HERE HE WAS OT'S FOR THE SPECIFIC QUESTION OF HUMANITARIAN AD WE WONT TE SEE AS MUCH HUMANITARIAN  GET INTO GOSET TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEEDIT WELL MAKING SHOL TET HAMAS KANEL STEILET THOU THAT'S WHY WE'VE DUNG ON THE ONE HAND EXPONDIT CAPASITY AT THE ISRAELY CROSSINGS THERE IS NOW MOLTHAN DOUBLE THE ECCESS CAPASITY AT ISRAEL'S CROSSINGS TO GET MOR AT AD ASWAY SPEAK RIGHT NOW THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED TROKS WORTH OF HUMANITARIAN AID SITTING ON THE GASEN SIDE OF THE KARAMSHALOM CROSSING WAITING FOR THE HUENT TO PICK IT UP AND DISTRIBUTED THE AID IS GETSING IN THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UAN IS STRUGGLING TO DISTRIBUTE THAT D AT THE PASTE THAT ISRAEL IS FACILITATING ITS ENTRY INTO GOSA ALL OF THAT IS TRUE BUT BECAUSE THERE'S NOWNTATU DISTRIBUTE THE AID THE BOTTOMLINE IS THAT THE WEST THE UNITED STATES PLACES TEEN ERE IN THE AERAB WORLD A WORKING WITH THE ISRAELLY GOVRNMENT TO AIR DROP AID INTO THE MIDDLE THAT IS NOT BECAUSE TE ISRAEL WON'T DISTRIBUTE THE AIGS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE TO DISTRIBUTE THE AID BECAUSE KOMAS WILL NOT SURRENDER AND THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL PEOPLE AND HIJACK THE AID MEANWHILE THE MEJAR BLAMING ISRAEL FOR ALL OF THAT AT THE SAME EXACT TIME ALL THIS HAS HAPPENING TH WHOTHES ACTUALLY SANK ANOTHER SHIP IS THE FIRST SHIP THAT THE HOO THES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUNK AT THIS POINT ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST A CARGOSHIP SANK IN THE RED SEA AFTER AN ATTACK BY HOTHY MILITANS TAKING ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND METRIC COMES A FERTILIZE OR

NOW THAT TAT THANK YOU I SHE DOESN'T LOVE YOU SHEDOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU I'LLEVE EVER IN MET MY FAVORITE CUT AWAY ACTUALLY HERE WAS MILEY CYRUS THE CUT AWAN MLEAST I IS IN THE ELECWAS REALLY REALLY FUNNY THE THE CUT AWAN MILEY BY MILEY WAS LIKE MI COTT CAN'T BLIEVE THIS LADY AND HONESTLY POINT SOR MILEY CYRUS FOR THAT THEN SHE RELEASED THE ACTUAL COVER AND A THE COVER IS OF COURSE A LADY HALF CLAD IN BAD BECAUSE THIS IS HOLLYWOOD AND ITS CALLED THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE AND POETRY NEW ALBUM THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT OUT APRIL NINETEEN ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION LIKES LIKE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ON THE INSTUS OH OH OCAS THESE ARE SOME OF HER BRILLIANT LYRICS SOME OF HER BRILLIANT LYRICS QUOTE AND SO I ENTS HER INTO EVIDENCE MY TARNISHE COAT OF ARMS MY MUS IS ACQUIRED LIKE BRUISIS MY TALISMANS AND CHARMS THE TICK TICK TICK OF LOVE BOMS MY VEINS OF PITCH BLACK ING ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE AND POETRY SINCERELY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT OH SHEIS THE TENTHGRAY GIRL AND SHES STARTY FOR AND AGAIN I HOPE SHE GETS MARRIED TO TRAVISCELSY AND HAS BABIES AND GROWS THE EFOP BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND ANY MORE OF READING THE LYRICS OF HER ALBUMS THAT READ LIKE A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL MADE ANOTHER ALBUM ABOUT HOW TORTURED SHE IS IN HOW SAD SHE IS BUT REALLY INSIDE SHE'S DEEPLY HAPPY BUT SHE'S REALLY SAD DON'T CARE IT'S STUPID ATS THAT IS YOUR MUSIC INDUSTRY THAT'S HOER GRAHME'S UP TATE NOW ON TO MORE SERIOUS MATTERS SO THE BIDE DEMINISTRATION IS NOBINE THE MIND THAT THEREIN IS THAT AMERICANS AT DO NOT TRUST THEM ON EMIGRATION THE REASON AMERICANS DO NOT TRUST THEM AN EMIGRATION IS BECAUSE THEY'VE BASICALLY DECLARED THAT THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF OPEN BOARDERS GOBIN IS CURRENTLY PULLING AT I I CET YOU NOT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT HAS THA THORTY SEVEN PERCENT APPROVAL RATING THAT IS NOT A REELECTRATING NOT REMOTELY ON IMIGRATION HE IS DEEPLY UNDERROTHIRSON ENBYSEE PULL BY THE WAY THAT SAME ENBESE PULL HAS HIM LOSING TO DONALD TRUMP BY FIVE POINTS FORTY SEVEN TO FORTY TWO AN IT HAS REPUBLICANS AHEAD ON THE GENERIC BALLAT BY FOUR POINTS RIGHT NOW THES ARE VERY BAD NUMBERS FOR JOBIDON NOT ONLY THAT AGAIN ON IMIGRATION THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T TRUST JOBIDON AND THEY THING THAT HE HAS THE UNALATERAL ABILITY TO ACTUALLY STOP THE MASS OFE WAVE OF ELEGAL IMIGRATION THAT WE'VE BEN SEEING BECAUSE IN FACT HE DOES ANDS WHAT THEY BELIEVE CORRECTLY IS THAT THE BIDE DEMINISTRATION HAS MADE IN OVERT DECISION THAT THEY WISHED THE BORDER TO REMAIN OPEN AND SON HE PROTESTS AND HE SAYS THEY DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE BILITY TO SHUT THE BOARDER NO ONE BELIEVES HIM ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE ALLAHANDROMAORICUS THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOME LAN SECURITY WHO IS CURRENTLY THEORETICALLY CAN BE IM PEACHD BY THE HOUSE SUGGESTING THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED MORE MIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES HE ACTUALLY SAID THIS AT DURINGTHE INTERVIEW WITH THE NAR TIMES WHAT WOULDN'T IT BE MORE ORDERLY WOULD'T IT BE RESPONSIBLE GOVERNANTS TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER A LAWFUL PATHWAY TO FILL WHAT WE HAVE WHICH IS A LABOR NEE AND CUT THE EXPLOICATIVE SMUGGLERS OUT AND GIVE THE INDIVIDUALS PAT TO ARRIVE AT LAWFULLY SAFELY IN IN ORDERLY WAY TO PERFORM LABOR THAT WE NEED THEY CAN SENTERMENTS HIS HOME THEY CAN RETURN HOME IN THEIR WORK IS DONE ISN'T THAT AN ELEMENT OF A WORKABLE IMIGRATION SYSTEM AND UT WHEN ASKED WHAT WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS YOU'D LIKE TO EXPAND LEGAL PATHWAYS IN ORDER TO RELIEVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE SOUTHERN BORDERWERE PEOPLE COMMIN ILEGALLY AND HE SAID YES AND TO FULFIL ONE OF THE GOLDS FOR EMIGRATION SYSTEM SO YET THEYT BE YES TO MORE MIGRATION ACCORDING TO ALEHANDRO MAORICAS AND SO THT DUNT EARLY CARE OTHER ITS LEGAL OR ILLEGAL AD ENTS OF BEING BASICALLY THE SAME THING THIS IS WHY PRESUMABLY JOBIDON CONTINUES TO KEEP THE BORDER OPEN NOW THE GAME THAT DEMOCRATS ERE PLAYING IS THEIR TRAING TO GET REPUBLICANS TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE OPEN BOARDER THE WAY THEY ARE PUBLICANS TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE OPEN BORDER IS TO CRAFT E QUITTINCL BY PARTISAN EMIGRATION BILL SO THAT WHEN THINGS CONTINUE TO SOCK THEY CAN THEN SAY REPUBLICANS HELPED CRAFT THE BILL IT'S THEIR FALL NOW ALL THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS ARE MOVING AGAINST DEMIGRATS DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE BUT ROB MANENDAS OF NEW JERSEY HE SAYS THAT SUPPORT FOR MASTY PORTATION HAS NOW DOUBLED WHICH OF COURSE IS TRUE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DECIDE YOU LET IN LITERALLY SIX TO SEVEN MILLIONY LEGAL IMIGRANTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS MINNIMUM THEN YOU STAND ON POL AT THIS FYING THIRTY ONE PERCENT OF AMERICAN SUPPORT PIORA TISING MASKYN PORTATIONS OF ALL PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY A LAKALY THAT'S OT FROM FIFTEEN PERCENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LANGUAGE OF TUPKER PO PRESSEN AN BATAN ALL THE WAY ON DOWT IS THAT N WORE ABOUT POLLING AND POLITICS OR YOU BELIEVE ITS ACTUALLY LANGUACE ABOUT POLICY I THINT IT'S A LOT OF O POLIT EXCEPTE GOTON T E LAST SEVERAL YEARS PEOPLE SEE TE SITUATION AT THE BORTER AND THE RESPONDING TO THE REPUBLICAN NARRATIVE AROUND WHATS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER ISN'T THERE'S A GLOBAL MIGRATION CHALLENGE BETWEEN  GLOBAL A CLIMATE CHANGE BETWEEN FAILE GOVERNMENTS AND OUR HEMISPERE THERE'S A CHALENE AT REET TOU REDRESS AT THE RECAUS AN ALSO HOW ITS APPEARING AT OUR BORDER BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT REPUBLICANS WHET RE PUBKANS TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU TALK BOUT A MASSIN VASION LIKE YOU HERE TEXAS REPUBLICANS TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE O REPOLICEMEN THEORY THESAR THINGS THAT HAVE THAT'VE GAINE T HOLD IN OUR ELECTRIC IS THATUAT REPUBLICANS ARE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THEY THINK ITS IF THEY AN IF THEY CAN COME OLICANS FERICY THERY THATS DANGEROUS ING OP THAT I MERICANS WILL TRUST THEM SO WHEN YOU SEE THE RISE AN SUPPORT FOR MASTRY PORTATIONS IT'S IN RESPARS TO A DANGEROUS REPUBLICAN NARRATIVE OH IS THE DANGEROUS PUBLICAN NARRATIVE THAT'S THE PROBLEM OKAY NOT THE GIGANTIC WAY OF OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION BY THE WAY EVERY ONE KNOWS WHOULD IS THE FACILITAING YOU

IMIGRATION AND THEYE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE LEGAL IMIGRANTS WHO BEAT UP COPS LAST WEEK ACTUALLY WOULD GO AND COMMIT CRIMES IN NEW YORK AND THEN THEYWOUD GO SPEND THE MONEY IN FLORIDA AND THEN THEY WOULD COME BACK TO W W YORK AND SO THE QUESTION WAS ASKEDBY SE IN AN ANCHORS WHY THEY COMING BACK TO NEW YORK WHIN THAT TO STAY ON IN FLORDA AND A THE ILLEGAL MIGRATION EXPERT JOHN MILLER WHOSE THE CHIEF LAWN FORSEMEN AN INTELLIGENCE ANNALIST FOR SENTOM HE SAYS I'M THE REASON THY COMEBACK TO NE YORK IS CAUSE THEY WON'T BE DEPORTED IF THER IN NEW YORK AND THE SIN AN ANCHORS ARE LIKE OH OH THAT'S AWKWARD ITS INDIVIDUALS I WENT OVER THERE RAPSHETS YESTERDAY MULTIPLE CHARGES GRANDLARSONY ROBBERY ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY GRANDLARSNY GRANDLARSNY A THIS PARTICULAR CRUOPERATED ON MOPEDS AND SCHOOTERS THEY WERE DOING ORGANIZED RETAIL TAFT THEY WERE DOING SNATCHES ON THE STREET I FONDS I PADS CLOTHING SO ON AND SO FORTH I ONE OF THEM THAT THEY ARE STILL SEEKING AS TEN CHARGES ON ONE DAY BECAUSE HE'S PART OF A PATIN THAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND I'M LOOKING AT THE DATES THAT THEYRE REST STARTED WHICH IS PROBABLY CLOSE TO WHEN THEY GOT HERE THE ONLY BEEN THERE COUPLE OF MONTHS SO WAT THE DETECTIVES ARE TELLING ME IS THEY HAVE CRUISE HERE THAT OPERATE IN NEW YORK DO ALL THEIR STEALING THEN GO TO FLARTED TO SPEND THE MONEY AND THEN COME BACK ON LIKE WON THEY TO STAY IND STEALIN FLARTIN THAT IT IS THER YOU GO TO JAIL OH OO THEN THE SIN ANGS A OH YOU MEAN BEING LOOSON IMIGRATION MEANS THAT MAGRANS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT NOW THAT'S SOTLY CRAZY OH OW THAT'S THAT SUPER AWKWARD WELL A KIM JEOFFREYS OF COURSE AT TEMPTING TO GET REPULLICANS TAYE OWNERSHIP OF THIS THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER HE WANTS THE R PUBLICANS STAKE THIS UP IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU REALIZED IL GET POLLY HALF A REPUBLICANS AN ALL DEMOCRATS TO BOT IN FAVOR OF THIS AND SO JEFFREYS WAS ASKED MARNGJUS THIS AGGREGATE WHAT'S IN THIS BILLS THIS GIANT BORDER BILL IS NOT ACTUALLY BORDER BILL IT CONTAINS BUT SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS AN ADE YOU CRANE CONTAINS FOURTEEN BILLY DOLLARS AND AIDE WHO ISRAEL IT CONTAINS AS WE'LL SEE THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND AID TO GOZA WHICH PRESUME WE'LL GO DIRECTLY INTO TERRIS POCKETS BECAUSE THAT'S HOUT WORKS WE SEND AID TWO PLACES THEYRE GOVERNED BY TERRIST AND IT GIVE SOME MONEY FOUR THE BORDR LIKE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR VARIOUS BORD PRIORITIES INCLUDING BY THE WAY A BUNCH OF MONEY TO QUONNT QUAT NON PROFIT GROUPS TO FACILITATE ILL LEGAL EMIGRATION SERVICES AND WERE DOWN AT THE BORDER AND HELY JUST TALL YOU THESE NON PROFIT ROUPS ARE LITERALLY FACILITATING I LEGAL MIGRATION OUT OF THE BORDER THER THAY THEY HAVE SIGNS AT THE BORDERS ING LIKE GOVIS WAY TO AVOID BORDER PATROL COME OVER TO OS IT THEY BASICLLY ARE CREATING SANCTUARY PATHWAYS INTO THE UNITED STATES IN ANY CASE YERES A KEEM JEOFFREYS TRYING TO AKE TOCLAM THAT WE TO PASS ALL THIS IS A PACKAGE THE REASON HE WANTS THAT OF COURSE IS BECAUSE THE BOLL HERE IS TO GET REPUBLICANS TO SIGN OFF ON BAD BORDER BILLS SO THAT THEY CAN'T RUN ON IT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION HERE HE WAS AND WE NEED A COMPREHENDS TO BILL YOU SAW THE SPEAKER YESTERDAY SAY THAT HES CAN BRING A STAND ALONE ISRAEL BILL TO THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE YOU RESPONSE WHAT WELLA VALUE WATE THAT LEGISLATION OVER THE NEXT TE DAYS I THEN ON TUESDAY MORNING HOUSE THEMO CRASSWILL MEET AS TA CONCAS SO YOU MIGHT BE OPEN TO IT OH TO THESIDE THE WAY FORWARD AS A RELATES TO AMERICAS NASSONAL SECURITY PRIORITIES CLEARLY WE'VE GOT TO SUPPORT ISRAELS ABILITY TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST HAMOS AND TO TEFEET HAMOS WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SORAD THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BRING THE HOSSAG IS HOME INCLUDING AMERICAN CITIZENS AND TO BE ABLE TO SERG HOMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THE PALISTIN INS CIVILIANS WHO ARE IN HARMS WAY IN CASAT THE NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN BEYOND THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ASSNO SECURITY PRIORITIES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD FIRST THAN FOREMOT CERTAINLY TO SUPPORT IN CRAINS EFFORT TO PUS BACK AGAINST RESTENT AGGRESSION ALSO TO SUPPORT OR ALLIES IN THE IN THE PACIFIC TI ON JAPAN SOUTH CAREE THE LEGISLATON BEING PUT FORTH BY HOUSE REPUBLICANS DOES NONE OF THAT THE RESPONSIBLE APPROACH IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE ONE TO ADDRESS AMERICAS NASMO SECURITY PRIRT OF COURSE THE OPPOSITE THE ACTUAL RESPONSIBLE APPROACH WOULD BO TO APPROACH EACH ONE OF THESE BILLS IS A SEPARATE GIANT BILTIES ARE BIG BILLS AND IN FACT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE CURRENTLY PRESUING SIR REPUBLICANS VERY EARLY ONINOUST PROCESS TRIED TO PASS A FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR AID TO ISRAEL BILL THEY DID SO BY HAVING IRESS TACKS OFFSETS AND THE GOAL WAS TO CPUT IN ONE PLACE IN ORDER YOU SPEND IN ANOTHER AN OW'S RESPONSIBLE BILL BUT DEMOCRATS REJECTED IT AND THEY DID SO ON THE BASIS THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE OFFSETTING STUFF SO NOW THE REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE LO KAY WILL CALL YOUR BLUFF WE'LL PUT FORWARD A BILL IN THE HOUSE THAT JUST PASS OF THE ADE ISRAEL REJECT TAT AT YOUR OWN PAREL WHICH SEEMS TO ME SMAR POLITICS BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAN OF DEMOCRATS R CN A CLAM THA THE ACTUALLY SUPPORT ISRAEL INTHE FACE OF GENECITLE TERRORISM THEN PRESUMABLY THY SOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT ANY PRECONDITIONS JUST PASS THE CLEAN BILL JUST DO IT IF DEMOCRATS WON'T THAT SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS THEY HAVE ANOTHER SET OF PRIORITIES O CASE SO WHAT EXACTLY IS IN THIS BORDER BILL YOU'R BEING TOLD A PACK OF LIES ABOUT THIS BORDER BILL AY YOU'R BEING TOLD FR EXAMPLE THAT IT ENDS CATCH IN RELEASE I'VE READ THE BILL LIKE THREE HUDRED SEVENTY PAGES LONG THERE'S MAY BE FORTY OR FIFTY RELEVANT PAGES LOT OF I IS TAT YOU CRANE AIDE A LOT OF IT IS ABOUT CRACK DOWNS ON ON DRUG CARTELLS THAT RE THAT ARE TRAFFIC IN FETINAL AND ALL THE REST BUT THE KEE BORDER PROVISIONS DO NOT IN FACT END CATCH AND RELEASE THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THAT FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRES ATTENTION OF EVERYBODY UNTIL THEY CAN BE FULLY A JUDICATED IN A CART AND THERE IS NO BILDING OF GIANT FACILITIES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE MASSD ATTENTION OF PEOPLE PLAS IT ALSO LEAVES IN PLACE THE SO CALL FLOORA SETTLEMENT WHICH SUGGEST THAT CHILDREN  CANNOT ACTIVELY BE DETAINED WITH PARENTS WHICH MEANS THE CHILDREN GET RELEASED INTO TE COUNTRY AND THEN IN ORDER TO RECONNECT THE PARENS YOU ACTUALLY IN UP RELEASING THE PARINTON O THE COUNTRY OT AS WELL SO MORGAN GOES THROUGH SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THE BILL IS NOT GOOD THE BILL MAY BE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE WAY THAT JOBIDON IS CURRENTLY PRACTICING BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT MANSATE ANYTHING FROM JOBIDON THAT HE ISN'T ALREADY ABLE TO DO UNDER CURRENT LAW SO IT'S GO THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE AGAIN MOST OF TH PEOPLE WHOR CAN BE COMMENTING ONTHE BILL HOF NOT ACTU READ THE BILL ISPENT THIS MORNING READING THE BLL IT'S MOREN THISN'T JUST ONCE SECOND FIRST IF YOUR LIKE MOST AMERICANS IT CANTA STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEAT EVERYTHING IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT USED TO BE BY THE TIME YOU PAY THE BILLS FILL UP YOUR CARGO GROCERY SHOPPING THERE MIGHT NOT BE

THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR REFUGY AND ENTRANCE ASSISTANT ACTIVITIES A THETTER THET ARE CURRENTLY LEGAL THAT WOULD BE A TWO POIN THREE BILLION DOLLAR GIVE WAY TO MANY OF THE NON PROFET ORGANIZATIONS THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND BY THE WAY DOWN TO BORE SOME OF THSE NON PROFET ORGANIZATIONS ARE ACTIVELY FACILITATING YOU THE LIMIGRATION NOT JUST PEOPLE OCROSS THE BORDER AND THEN THEY WANT O DISAPPEARINTO THE INTERIOR UNTI THESE NON PROFITS LITERELY JUST BRING THEM FOOD BRING THEM WATER SHUTTLE THEM INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY AND THEREE BEN PRETTY SURIOUS ALLEGATIONS THAT SOME THESE NON PROFITS ARE OUTRIGHT IN GAGE NE LEGAL ACTIVITIES LIKE HELPING TO BREAK DOWN THE BORDER WALL WHEN BORDER PATROL ISN'T ACTUALLY PRESENT THERE IS ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR U S A ID AND GOAS AS

ASSOCIATED COST FOR OU A CITIZENSHIP AND EMIGRATION SERVICES INCLUDING A HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR NON PERSONAL OPERATIONS INCLUDING TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES SO PERESEMN WE FOR ALL THE JUDICIAL HERINGS AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR FACILITIES AND FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING RELATED EXPENCES WHAT EXACTLY WITH THOSE TRENURALATED EXPENSES BE WHLE FOR BORDER PATROL THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE TRAINED TO INCLUDE DESCALLATION STRATEGIES AND METHODS I DENTIFINE SCREENING AND RESPONDING TO BULNERABLE POPULATIONS THE IM PACT TO BOR SECURITY OPERATIONS ON NATURAL RESOURCES THRING THEY GOT SOM ENVIRONMENTALISTS LECTURES THE BORDER PATROL AND THEY HAVE TO BE LECTURED ON QUOTE RELEVANT CULTURAL SOCITAL RATIAL AND RELIGIOUS TRAINING SO WE HAVE DIVERSITY TRAINING FOR THE BORDER PATROL OFFICERS VERY VERY INTERESTING SUFF NOW THE CORE OF THE BORER PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DO NOT AN CACHIN RELEASE AND THEY CREATE A SORT OF MANDITORY QUON QUOT SHUT DOWN BUTHEY ARE'T ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN THE SHUTTLING INTO THE COUNTRY THEY JUST SHUTTLE EVERYBODY OVER TO PORTS MENTRY SO HERE IS WHAT IT SASIN A LOT OF THIS IS THE DIRECT TEXT TO THE BILL SECTION TWO THIRTY FIVE B UNDER THE BILL QUOT NON CUSTODIAL PROCEEDINGS THIS THE PARTRI READ IT NES AT IN'T UNDERSTAND I'M HERING FROM VARIOUS CENTERS INCLUDING CURSO ASYNIMA THAT THIS ENDS CATCHION RELEASE I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW UNDER SECTION TO THIRTY FIV BE QUOTE THE SECRETARY BASED UPON OPERATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY REFER IN ALIEN APPLICAN FOR ADMISTION FOR PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION IF THE ALIEN INDICATES AN INTENTION TO APPLY FOR PROTECTION DETERMINATION OR EXPRESSES A CREDIBLE FEAR OF PERSECUTION OR TORTURE CAY NOUT AGET THESE BE NON CUSTODIAL PROCEEDINGS AS YOU MAK UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF ENGLISH CUSTODIAL PROCEEDINGS WOULD BE WERE YOU GET HELD NON CUSTODIAL PROCEEDINGS A RE YOU GET RELEASED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES IN FACT IT SAYS THAT CLEARLY ALIENS REFERRED FOR PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE SECTION SHALL BE RELEASED FROM PHYSICAL CUSTINOT MAY BE RELEASED SHALL BE RELEASED FROM PHYSICAL CUSTODY AND PROCESS IN ACCORDANCE WITHTHE PROCEEDURES DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION AN ADULT ALIEN INCLUDING AHEAD OF HOUSEHOLD WO HAS BEEN REFERRED FOR PROCEEDING UNDER THE SECTION SHALL BE SUPERVISED UNDER THE ALTERNATIVES TO DETENTION PROGRAM OF YOU ESS IT MIGRATION IN CUSTOMS INFORCEMENT IMMEDIATELY UPON RELEAE FOM PHYSICAL CUSTODY AND CONTINUING FOR THE DURATION OF SUCH PROCEDING WHAT WOULD THAT AMOUNT TO IT COULD BE HOUSE OR ASTIC COULD BE TAT WE PUT AN ANKLE BRACELET ONU IT COULD BE THAT WE JUST RELEASING INSTO THE INTERIOR RELIT COME BACK AT A CERTAIN DATE THE SECRETARY SHALL ENSHIRTS O THE GREATEST EXTENT PRACTICABLE THAT THE REFERL OF A FAMILY UNIT FOR PROCEEDINS UNDER THE SECTION INCLUDES ALL MEMBERS OF SUCH FAMILY FO OUR TRAVELING TOGETHER SO YOU SHOULD TRY TO SO IF ONE PERSON CLAIMS ASYLUM YOU CAN TREAT THEM ALL IS IF THEY'VE BEEN CLAIMED ASYLUM AND THEYU'RE GOING TO RELEASE THEM INTO THE INTERIOR AGAIN NONE OF THE SUPPLIES TO UNACCOMPANIE MINERS IF AN ALIEN RECEIVES A POSIT IFE PROTECTION DETERMINATION THERE IMMEDLIATELY ISSUED EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION SO IF THEY ARE JUDICATED THAT THEY HAVE REFUGE YOU STATUS IMMEDIATE LIKE BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE BUILDING THEY GET A CARD THAT EFFECTIVELY SAYS THEY CAN WORK IN THE UNITED STATES AN OF COURSE REEN OVER TI FLORUS WHICH SAYS THAT THEIR CAMPY ANY FAMILY SEPARATIONS THAT REMAINS IN PLACE AS WELL NOW SECTION THIRTY TWO O TWO OF THE BILL ACTUALLY LOOSINS THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO CLAIM ASYLUM THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT THE STRENGTHENING THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO CLAIM ASYLUM WILL TALK ABOUT THAT PROVISION ONE SECOND BUT THE BASELINE CLAM OF ASYLUM ACTUALLY GETS LOOSEN HERE BY DEFINITION SECTION THIRTY TO O TWO SAIS YOU AVE THE DECLARE A CREDIBLE FEAR RIGHT THE ORIGINAL DEFINITION THAT GETS CHANGE I USED TO SAY THAT THERE HAD TO BE A SIGNIFICENT POSSIBILITY THAT THE ALIEN COULD ESTABLISH OLIGIBILITY FOR ASYLUM CAY THAT WAS CHANGED TO A REASONABLE POSSIBILITYES SO NOW IN ORDER CLEMISILEMU JUST HAVE TO SHOW A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU COULD ESTABLISH OLLIGIBILITY FOR ASYLUM SO THIS BILL ACTUALLY LOOSENS THE DEFINITION OF A CREDIBLE FEAR T ESHU MAKES IT EASIER TO CLAIM ASYLUM NOT HARDER NOW THE ALIEN DOES HAVE TO SHOW TO RECEIVE ACTUAL ASYLUM THAT THERE ARE NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR CONCLUDING THE ALIEN COULD RELOCATE TO ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE ALIEN'S COUNTRY OF NATIONALITY OR IN THE CASE OF AN ALIEN HAVING NO NATIONALITY ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE ALIENS COUNTRY OF LAST IBITUAL RESIDENCE WHAT IS THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU TRAVEL UP FROM HONDORIS TO THE UNITED STATE YOU HAVE TO SHOW NUMBER ONE IF YOU WANT ACTUAL LEGAL ASYLUM YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU COULDN' HAV JUST RELOCATED IN SIDE HUNDORUS AND TWO THEY OU COULDN'T HAVE RELOCATED IN MEXICO AS YOU WERE PASSING THROUGH MEXICO RIGHTY THAT THAT THAT'D BE THE DEFINITIONIST BUT THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE OF COURSE THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE WHO ARE CLAIMING ASYLUM ARE NOT DOING SO LEGALLY EVEN THE DEFINITION OF ASYLUM IS SOMEWHAT IRRELEVANT IF PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY COMING CLAIMING THAT THEY HAVE A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING ASYLUMN THEN RELEASED INTO THE INTERIOR AND ALL OF THIS OF COURSE TDEPENDS ON THE ACTUAL INPLEMENTATION BECASE IF YOU AVE A BUNCH O BORDER PATROL OFFICIALS WHOAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED BY THE AD MINISTRATION TO BE REALLY LOOSE ABOUT HOW THEY APPLY THESE RULES IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE LOSSAS THEY WILL JUST ALLOW PEOPLE THROUGH AND THEN THOSE PEOPLE NEVER SHOW UP AGAIN SO PEOPLE HORE SAYING THIS IS A STRICT BORDERBILL ARE FOCUSSING IN ON THE REDEFINITION OF REASONABLE GROUNDS RIGHT TO THAT THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY CLAIM ASYLUM AND THEN YOU SHOW UP FOR YOUR SECONDARY DATE OR YOU SHOW UP AND YOU SAY I HAVE A CREDIBLE FEAR OF RETURNING O MY HOME COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE A REASONABLE SHOWING NOT AHT NOT AT AGAIN A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY YOU CAN'T RELOCATE YOR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OR THE CAN'T STAND MEXICO YEN ALL YOUUD HAVE TO SAY PRESUMABLY IS I CAN'T STAIN MY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN BECAUSE I HAVE A CREDIBLE FEAR THAT IN MY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN ANYWHERE I GO THOSE TRACK ME DOWN AND KILL ME HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING TO JUDICATE DET IS THE ASYLUM OFFCERGAN TA SAY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HOW D'S THAT WORK AND IF YOU SAY OKCA WHAL YOU COULD THEORETICALLY STAY IN MEXICLE INS T NONE ENOUT THE DRUGCAR TELLS CAN A FOLLOW ME TO EXICO IS THAT ENOUGH ARE WE JUS SHIFTING AROUND DEFINITIONS S THAT PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO ESCAPE INTO THE INTERIOR BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IF YOU WANTS SHUT THE BORDER YOU NEED TO DO ONE OF TWO THINGS ARE BOTH ONE REMAIN A EXICO NO ONE CROSS IS THE BORDER UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY EJUDICATED AS A TRUE REFUG YOU STAY IN MEXICO UNTIL YOGET YOUR COURT DAT THAT'S WHAT DON TRUMPHADDON PLACE AND YOURE BY NABIGATED IT TWO IF YOU SHOP ON THE BORDER ANDWHERE IT GOING TO REMAN A MEXICO WE HAVE VAST DETENTION FACILITIES AND YOU TAND THE DETENTION FACILITIES AND SO YOU ARE ADMITTED OR EJECTED BUT SO LONG AS WE ARE NOT DOING EITHER OF THOSE FIRST TWO THE DEFINITION OF ASYLUM BECOMES ALMOST O RELEVANT AND HERIN LIES THE PROB ORGAN TO GET TO THE CON WHAT EMERGENCY PROVISIONS OF THE BILD THAT PEOPLE ARE HANGING THEIR HATS ON TO CLAIM THIS IS STRONG ON THE BORDER IN ONE SECOND FIRST VALENTINES DAY IS COMING UP FAST GERMY'S HAS THE PERFECT GIFTS TO SURPRISE YOUR ETTER HALF WHETHE YOU'RE SHOPING FOR HIM OR FOR HER GERMY'S HAS A BUNDLE THEY WILL LOVE FROM DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE TO

OF IT IS GONE GERMY'S VALENTINES DAY SAIL THE BEST WAY TO TREAT YOUR VALENTINE AND YOURSELF UK AM MEANWHILE THE OTHER ELEMENT OF THIS BORDER BILL THE SO CALLED BORDE SECURITY BILL THAT A SUPPOSED TO MAKE CONSERVATIVES FEEL MORE COMFORTABLL IS BURB IS IS WHAT'S CALLED BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY SO HERE IS HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND HEARING A LOT ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM IN THE MEDIAT TO DAY SOME ACTUAL READ YOU THE SECTIONS FROM THE BIL THAT AR RELEVANTS YOU KNOW ZACTLETS GOING ON FIRST THE SECRETARY THERE'S OF HOMERAND SECURITY MAY ACTIVATE THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY IF DURING A PERIOD OF SEVEN CONSEC CUTIVE DAYS THERE'S AN AVERAGE OF FOUR THOUSAND OR MORE ALIENS ARE ENCOUNTERED EACH DAY A GASO JUST TO GET THAT STRYT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SEVENTY PERIOD IN WHICH YOU AVERAGE FOUR THOUSAND BORDER EN COUNTER A DAY THAT BY THE WAY IS ACTUALLY IN UNDER CAMP BECAUSE IT ASWILL DISCUSS IN ONE SECOND THE WAY THEYOU ACTUALLY DU THE BORDER ACCOUNT TDOES NOT APPLY TO CHILDREN FROM NON CONCTIGUOUS COUNTRIES I E MEXICO OR CANTEASO THAT BORDER COUNT DOES NOT INCLUDE KID TO AR ARRIVING FROM HONDORIS OR A'LL SOVADOR FOR EXAMPLE IT DOES NOT APPLY TO ALIENS NOT FROM MEXICO OR CANIDA AND IT DOESN'T COUNT GODAWAYS FOR PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY RUSH ACROSS THE BORDER AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY ARREST THEM AT THE BORDER THE BORD PATROL DOESN'T ACTUALLY ENCOUNTER THEM THAT DOESN'T COUNT IF YOU HAVE A THOUSAND PEOPLE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WHORE ENTERING BETWEEN PORTS OF ENTRY AND THEY ARE JUST ESCAPING INTO THE INTERIOR AND WE KNOW THERE THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE CAMERAS ALL ALONG THE BORDERHAVE BEEN DOWN OF TE SOUTHERN BORDER AS YOU CAN SEEL VOR A DAILY WHIRER WE DAT A WHOLE DOCUMENTRY ON THIS THOSE PEOPLE DON'T COUNT TOWARD THE COUNT SO THERE'S A WILD UNDER COUNT BUTIF YOU'RE AT FOUR THOUSAND A DAY RIGHT WHICH AGAIN IS GOING TO AMOUNT TO OVER THE PORTS OF A YEAR ONE POINT FOR SIX MILLION PEOPLE ENTERING THE COUNTRY IF YOU'REAT FOUR THOUSAND A DATE THEN THESE SECRETARY IS ALLWED TO ACTIVATE VES THIS BORDER OF BORD EMERGENCY AUTHORITY THE SECRETARY MUST ACTIVATE THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY IF DURING A PERIOD OF SEVEN CONSECUTIVE CALENDER CALENDER DAYS TERE'S AN AVERAGE OF FIVE THOUSAND OR MORE ALIENS OARE ENCOUNTERED EVERY DAY THAT WOULD BE ONE POINT EIT TWO FIVE MILLION PEOPLE PER YEAR SO THAT IS THE CUT OFF POINT WHERE THE SECRETARY MUST ACTIVATE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY WHAT IS THAT MEAN THAT THAT EMERGENCYE AUTHORITY ALL RIGHT NOW IF YOU ARRIVE AT SAY THE SAN MAGELGATE WHICH IS WHERE I WAS IN THAT VIDIO DOWN IN ARIZONA THAT IS NOT A PORT OF ENTRY IF YOU' ARRIVE AT TH PORT OF ENTRY BORDER PATRAL WIL STILL PICK YOU UP AND THERE'S THE CUD DETENSIONS ENTHERE A MILE AWAY YOUR PROCESS WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS URIN THE COUNTRY THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY WOULD ALLOW THE SECRETARY OF HOLAN SECURITY IF THEREARE FOUR THOUSAND AND MANDATE THAT THE SECRETARY OF HOMANSICURITY IF THERE ARE FIVE THOUSAND TELL EVERYBODY YOU CAN'T BE PROCESS YERE YOU HAVE TO BE PROCESS AT A LOCAL POINT OF ENTRY ARE YOUVE TO GO TO A PORT OF ENTRY IN ORDER TO BE PROCESS NOW IT'S UN CLEAR WHETHER A YOU SHOW UP AT THE BORDER BORE PATROL SIMPLY DRIVES YOU THERE MAYBE MAYBE THE NOW YOU'RE ON AMERICAN SOIL ARE YOU PUSHED BACK ACROSS THE BORDNAGE DROP YOU BACK ACROSS THEIOTHER SIDE OF THE GATE OR DO THEY NOW PUT YOU INTA BOS AND INSTEAD OF THEM BUSSING YOU LIKE A MILE AWAY THEY SIMPLY BUSS YOU TO THE LOCAL PORT OF ENTRY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PORT OF ENTRY DURING ANY ACTIVATION OF THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY THE SECRETARY SHALL MAINTAIN THE CAPACITY TO PROCESS AND CONTINUE PROCESSING A MINIMUM OF ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED INIDMISSIBLE ALIENCEACH CALENDER DAY SO HE CAN'T SHALL DOWN TO BORTH PORTS VENTRY HEST ACTUALLY CONTINUE AT A MINIMUM TO ALOW FOURTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE A DAY INTO THE COUNTRY VIA THESE PORTS OF ENTRY AN NOW DOS THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEM SOMEHOW I'M FAILING TO SEE HOW IT DOES IF SO AND THEN IS IT TURNS OUT THEY POK A BUNCH OF HOLES IN THI SUPPOSED EMERGENCY AUTHORITY SO FOR EXAMPLE THE SECRETARY SHALL NOT ACTIVATE THE BORDER E MERGENCY AUTHORITY DURING THE FIRST CALENDER YEAR FROM ORE THAN TWO HNDRED SEVENTY CALENDE R DAYS DURING THE SECOND CALENDER YOAR FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE CALENDER DAYS DURING THE THIRD CALENDER YEAR FRO MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTY CALENDER DAYS SO EVEN IF OU'RE GETTING FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE O DAY IN YOUR TWO YOUE CAN ONLY ACTIVATED FOR TWEUNDRED TWENTY FIE DAYS DURING YOUR THREE FOR A HUNDRED AN EIGHTY CALENDER DAYS SO HALF THE YEAR IT SIMPLY TH USANDTH AUPLY THERE'S NO WAY TO ACTUALLY MAINTAIN THIS YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT LICKAN OPEN ENDED BORDER AUTHORITY TO SHUT IT DOWN FAVE FIVE THOUSAND A DAY EVEN TO DAY THAT ONLY APPLIES FOR TWO UNDRED SEVENTY CALENDER DAYS SO WHY PRECISELY IT ULET LET' SAY THE EAR THE DRUGCARD HELS WHY NOT FACILITAYS THSE PEOPLE WON'T BE PROCESS REY THE'RE NOT PROCESS YBECASE THEY'RE LITERALLY STOPPED FROM PROCESSING IF THE BORDER SECURITY IF IT'S SHOT AND PORTSVENTRY CANT PROCESS EVERYBODY SO LET'S SAY YOU THE DRUGCARD HELLS WHY NOT NOW BRING IT TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY DO IT FOR TWO UNDR SEVENTY DAYS AND THEY CAN DO THIS JUST DO IT EVERY DAY FIVE THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY THEY GET REJECTED FOR TWO UNDRED SEVENTY DAYS NOWT'S EXHAUSTED THE BORDER AUTHORITY NOW I CAN'T USE SEMERGENCY AUTHORITY ANY MORE SEE STILL ITS TO PROCESS EVERYBODY WHO SHOWS UP OR KEEP IT AT FIVE THOUSAND AND ONE AND IF YOU IVE IT A FIVE THOUSAND AND ONE FOR TWENTER SEVENTY STRAHT DAYS THEN ON DAY TWO SEVENTY ONE OF THE YEAR YOU FLED THE BORDER WITH TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THE DRUGCAR TELLS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THIS THEY RUN THE BORDER I'VE BEEN DOWN AT THE BOARD THEY HAVE LITERAL DRUG CART HELP DRONES THAT ARE FLYING OVER THE AMERICAN SIDE OF THE BORDER AND MONITERING EVERY SPECIFIC BORDR PATRAL AGENT ACCORDING TO THIS BILL THE SECREDTARY TSHALL SUSPEND ACTIVATION OF THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY NOT LATER THAN FOURTEEN CALENDER DAYS AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH THERE IS DURING A PERIOD OF SEVEN CONSECUNTIVE CALENDER DAYS IN AVERAGE IOF LESS THAN SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE EN COUNTER LEVEL USE FOR ACTIVATION SO IN OTHER WORDS THE BORDER THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY HAS TO BE THEN REVOTE WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF THE NUMBERGOING DOWN TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BORDER EN COUNTERS PER DAY BATTI THAT IS BY LAW WHAT'S MORE THERE'S ANOTHER HOLE THAT'S POKE IN THIS WHICH IS IF THE PRESIDENT FINES IT IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY THE PRESIDENT MAY DIRECT THE SECRETARY TO SUSPEND THE USE OF THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY ON AN EMERGENCY BAYS US SO THE PRET SO JOBIDIN LET SAY THAT THAT MAYORCUS IS MAN DATED THEY'RE FIVE THOUSAND A DAY FOR SEVEN DAYS HE'S MAN DATED TO KICK IN THE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY BIDIN CAN SUSPEND IT BADN CAN SAY NOT DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT NOW THE SECRETARY SHALL SUSPEND THE BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY FOR NOT MORE THAN FORTY FIVE CALENDER DAYS WITHIN A CALENDER YEAR NOTWITHSTANDING ON ANY LIMITATIONS ON TH USE OF AUTHORITY SO THAT MEANS THAT THE SECRETARY CAN THAN OVERRULE THE PRESIDENTS AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TWO HND ON SEVENTY DAYS WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN IS IF THE PRESIDENT USED AS AUTHORITY YOU'RE A READY DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DAYS IN YOUR TWO YOU ARE ALREADY DOWN TWO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AND IN YOUR THREE YOUARE ALREADY DOWN TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DAYS THAT BORDER EMERGENCY AUTHORITY COULD EVEN BE USED EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO ALL BY THE WAY ALL BORDER CASES ALL CASES UNDER THIS BILL CAND NOW NO LONGER BE RESOLVED BY THE FIFTH CIRCUIT FORT OF APPEALS WHICH IS A MUCH MORE CONTR T IVE CIRCUIT COURT INSTEAD IT KICKS ALL OF THEM OVER TO THE DESEY CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WHY YOU KNOW WHY IS THE DESY CIRCUIT CORT OF APPEALS THEY LEFT WHEN COURT ANSE THEY WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT DEMOCRATS WANT THEM TO DO DOES THIS THING SHUT THE BORDER IN ANY SERIOUS WAY THERE LOT OF PEOPLE CLAIMING THIS THE VERY HARSH BORDER PUT BOR CONTROL METHOD IT DOESN'T MAN DATE NEARLY ANYTHING THE THING THAT IT MANDATES IS NOT IN END TO CATCHIN RELES THE THING THAT IT MANDATES IS NOT IN FACT A LOWER ANDMEAN ABASICALLY MAKES THE NEW SUPPOSED CAP ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION AND IT REALLY IS NOT ONE POINT AIGT MLLION IT'S WELL AN ACCESSIVE TO MILLION IT DOESN'T COUNT ANY OFTHE GODAWAYS BASILY THE NEW NORMAL IS ONE POINT AIGHT MILLION PEOPLE ARE SAYNG WELL YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S A SHALL THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE THE SECRETARY COMEN SECURIT HY MUST DO THE THING BUT HE CAN' DO IT UNDER YES BUT THERE YOU NO WIAN SECRETORMAORCHOST TO KICK THES THING IN THAT FORTY NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE I'M NOT IS SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WILL MORE THAN THAT HE CAN POECOLES IN THIS EVERY WHICH WAY THE GULL HERE FOR DEMOCRATS IS VERY CLEAR GET REPUBLICANS TO SIN ON TO THE BILLS THAT CAN THEN CLAIM THAT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS AFTER THIS IS SOMEHOW ALSO REPUBLICAN'S FAULT THAT'S THE GLOWN DOES IT CREATE ANY LONG STANDING SERIOUS CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM THE ONLY LONGSTANDING SERIIS CHANGE TO THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE A POSITIVE ANYWOOD WOULD BE THE CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL STANDARD FOR ASYLUM I DOUBT WOULD ACTUALLY BE AE A GOOD CHANGE TO THE SYSTEM BUT IS THAT WORTH BUYING INTO JOBIDON SIMPLY APPLYING THE LAW AS HE SEES FIT HERE ANYWAY AGAIN POLITICAL OWNERSHIP OF THE ISSUE VERSES A CHANGE TO LAW JOBIDON IS BUCKING THE LAW IS AT CURENTLY STANDS HIS HE AN A FIRMATIVE OBLIGATION IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TOEN FORCEPORTA LAW HE IS NOT DOING IT PASSING MORE LAW IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT FACT THAT' SIMPLY CONTO MAKE REPUBLICANS POLITICALLY COMPLICIT IN WHATEVER JOBIDON DOES WITH THE BORDER AY SO THE REASON THAT JOBDON IS DOING ALL THIS IS BECAUSE HE FEELS THE THREAT FROM HIS LEFT HE FEELS THREATSO HE'S TRYING TO BASICALLY HAVE THE BABY WITH THIS BORDER BILL THAT'S GOING NOWHERE BY THE WAY SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE MY JOHNSON SAYS THE THING AS HE MEN COMING UT FOR A VOTES STEVSCOLLYS LIKE NOW WHEN I DN BRING TIS UP FOR A VOTE IT TO BAD BILL WERE NOT DOING IT THE REASON THAT JOBIDAN IS PUSHING SO FAR TO THE LEFT ON THINGS LIKE A MIGRATION IS BECAUSE HE TRULY BELIEVES THE ONLY WAY'S GON AWIN IS TO GOT OUT HE LEFT WING BAS THIS A WRONG CALCULATION BY HIM THE WAY THATHE'S GONE AWIN IF HE DOES WHIN IS BY WINNING A FEW RUALE WHITE VOTS AN WINING OVER SUBURBAN WOMEN THAT'S THE ACTUAL WAY THAT HE WINDS THE PROBLEM FOR JOBIDAN IS THAT HE'S A BAD GANDED IT JOBIDON YESTERDAY HE SUGGEST IS IS THE WEARDEST RACE THAT HE HAS EVER BEEN AND WHILE I KNOW JOIN THE CLUBDED OLOR I'M FEELING GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE ARE I REALLY AM YOU KNOW  THE FOLK SIR OR STARTING FOKUSS IN AN BE GI WER RENEAGAINST SIR HES IHE'S NOT FOREIGNYTHIN HE'S AGAINST EVERYTHING O MEIS THORS THE WEARDEST CAN'T FANY EVNISSEEN WORSE THO E TERMS ES BEHAVER THEN THE LAST TIME IT TWOIN E TWENT I'M SO I'M THIS IS THIS THE WEARIST RACE HES EVER BEEN IN I MEAN I'LL GIVE HIM THAT IS THE SUPERWEARD RACE BUT TOM TRUMP IS BY THE WAY UPRIGHT NOW I MEAN THE POLES ARE WHAT THE POLES ARE AND AGAIN DOWNS FROM SORTIF LIKE WEIRD DISTRACTABLE NATURE IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I THINK PEOPLE LIKE THIS PLATER LIKE LOOK I LIKE THE DISTRACTHED GUY RAT THAN THE GOI WHOSE LAZER FOCUST ON DOING DUMB CRAP IN DONALD TRUMP SPENT THE WEEKEND ACTIVELY TELLING PEOPLE THAT HE LOKS LIKE ELVAS PRESSLY I'M NOT GETTING HE ACTIVELY DID THAT HE WENT ON HIS TRUTH SOCIAL PAGE AND HE PUT OUT IN ACTUAL IMAGE OF HIMSELF IN WHICH HE IS MASHED UP WITH ELVAS AND HE SAYS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING MA LOOK LIKE ELVIS AND MOST AMERICANS LIKE CO FINA ID SO RATHER HAVE THAT THEN WHAT YOU HAVE CURRENTLY EMMA SEND BE CEIVES AT A VERY UN COMFORTABLE INTERVIEWIT THE BLACK VOTER WHERE THE BLACK LODERWAS LIKE A THE ECCONOMY IS GODUNDER TRUMP AND I LIKE THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW SO OT NO YOU'RE HEARING THAT'S  THERES  BEBELIEVE YOUR WERBIT WHO WERE HE'V GO WITHOUTS O ER CONSIDER FOR SHORE ALOT O MY PASER POVOSLY BY SOI EE OGER WES OLWE OL E WHAT'S WEOL FOR I FOR PRES AND CHOP WA COT ALLWE ALL AN THER CI CHOE BY THE Y WELL WE WE OLL W BY E WE WARE WE SHAL AT THAT'S HAIN THAT ONLY THING THAT UT HER ALLEN ALE EA ALRE A IN E THAT O CHOL WE HAD MONE BY THE WAY MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AGAINST ON TRUM INCLUDING CLASSFID DOCUMEN STUFF THE PROBEM IS THE JOBIDON IS DONE THE SAME SORT OF STUFF ACCORDING TO AXIOS PRESIDEN BIDIN STEAM IS NOW CONCERNED THAT SPECIAL COUNCIL ROBERT HURDS INVESTIGATION INUBIDIN'S HANDLEG AND CLASSFID DOCUMENTS WILL HURT HIS REELECT CAMPAIGN BI NEEDS DON ASPEC CRIMINAL CHARGES BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT HERS REPORT WILL INCLUDE EM BARRASSING DETAILS POSSIBLY WITH PHOTOES ON HOW BIDIN STORE DOCUMENTS BECAUSE AGAIN CLASS FI DOCUMENS WERE IN HIS GARAGE AND ALSO ANY PRIVATE OFFIS THAT HE USED SO IF THE ENTIRE RIP ON DONALD TRUMP IS THAT HE'S VERY CARELESS OF CLASSFI DOCUMENTS BECAUE HE PUT BOXES ON THE STAGE AN MARLAGO WELL I MEAN DAT'S AWKWARD FOR JOBIDON ACCORDING TO AXIOS ANTHONY COLY OF FORMER SENIOR AT BIZER TO MARIC GARLAND CAUGHT THE BIDIN STEAM ATTENTION RECENTLY WHEN HE WROTE THE BIDIN IN THOSE IN HIS ORBIT HAD KNOWIN TO BLAME BUT THEMSELVES FOR GARLAN TO PLONING A SPECIAL COUNCIL COLEY SAID BIDAN SEEM WAS NOT INITIALLY TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS AND PUT GARLAND INTO KNO WIND SITUATION SO THIS COULD CERTAINLY HURTS GO BIDON'S REA LIKE CAMPANKAS AGAIN ONE OF THE POINTS HE'S USING AGAINST TRUMP HE SHE'S OURRESPONSIBLE THE ADULTER BACK IN THEROOMAND THE I TURNS OUT HE'S DONE A LOT OFTHE SAME STUFF THE DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE AND THIS IS WHY HE KEEPS DOUBLING DOWN ON THE ON THE WILD LEFT WING POLICY SO HE IS NOW PANDERING TO THE WORST PARTS OF HIS BAS APE THAT RECEIVES ENORMOUS BLOWBACK OVER THE WEEKEND BUT HAPPENS T BE TRUES BY PERSEN IM STEVEN TOLINSKY OVER AT THE WALTZ RETURNAL

ND THEREFOR LOSE THE ELECTION AND ALL HE NEEDS IS COVER FROM THE MEDIA WHICH HE IS GETTING THE ENTIRE NE YORK TIMES NOW DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT THE CRISIS IN THE MELEAST WAS NOT CAUSE BAKOMAS ACTIVELY ATTACKING AND MURDERING SOME TWELVE HUNDRED JEWS AND KINNAPPING TO UNDRED FORTY OTHERS THAT THE CRIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS ISRAEL FIGHTING BACK AGAINST KAMAS AND SO LITERALLY EVERY DAY THERE JUST PLASTERING ON THE FRONT PAGES THE SUFFERING OF THE POOR PEOPLE OF GAZA ALL OF WHICH BY THE WAY COULD BE ENDED RIGHT NOW ALLCOMAS HAS TO DO IS WALK OUT OF THE TUNNELS WITH THEIR HANDS UP WITH THE HOSTAGES IN TO RELEAST THE HOSTAGES GO INTO EXILE AND ALL OF THE VIOLENCS STOPS TOMORROW THAT'S THE END OF THE VIOLANDS AND THEN WHEN REBUILDING FASE BUT THE NEAR TIME'S NOT CALLING FOR THAT

YOUR TIMES WHAT CAN BE POSSIBLY SAY TO THE CHILDREN OF GOZA I MEAN THE THING THAT YOU CAN SAY TO THE CHILDREN OF GOZA IS MABE YOUR PARENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPORTED A TERRO GROUP AND MAYBE YOR PARENTS RIGHT NOW SHOULD EXPEL THAT TERRO GROUP FROM THEIR LEADERSHIP MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE SOLUTION NICK KRISTOV SAYS MY GOVERNMENT IS ON THE SIDE ENGAGED FROM Y PRESENT BIDEN HAS REFERRED TO IS

PAYING ACTUALLY FOR INDIS TRULY IN DISCRIMNA BMMING FOR QUITE A WILE BUT THIS OF COURSE IS THE IS THE THE IDEA HERE IS THAT ISRAEL IS SUPPOSED TO ESSENTIALLY PRE EMTIVELY STOP ITS WAR AGAINST COMOSS WHICH OF COURSE IS RIDICULOUS O THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACES ON THE ONE HAND THERE'STILL SOME DEMOCRATS WHO REALIZE THAT HEY COMOSS SHOULD BE DEFEATED ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARE WETTED TO THIS PECULIAR IDEA THAT UNLESS ISRAEL IS FORCED INTO CONCESSIONS TO TERRORISTS THEN MIDDLE EASTERN CONFLICTS BECOMES MORE BROAD AND INEVITABLE WHICH OF COURSE IS A LIE IT'S A LIE YOU KNON'T CREATESMINLEATION CONFLICT WEAKNESS AS ALWAYS PRECEPTIONS OF WEAKNESS OUR DEATH IN THE MIDDLE EAST AN IT'S THE UNITED STATES ATTEMPTING TO MAKE ISRAEL WEAKER BY RESTRICTING THEIR ACTIVITIES AGAINST GOZA THAT IS THE ENTIRE THING YOU CANNOT HOLD THESE YOU THOUGHTS AT ONCE YOU CANNOT SAY THA YOU WISH TERRORSM TO LOSE AND ALSO THAT YOU WISH ISRAEL TO NEGOTIATE WITH TERRAS YOU CAN'T DO THOSE WO THINGS THT THAT'S EXACTLY THE BY ADMINISTRATION IS DOING IT'S ON THE ONE HAND YOUOF HAKIM JEOFFREYS CORRECTLY SAYING THAT THE UNITED STATE SHOULD NOT PUT CONDITIONS ON ALLIES

CONSOM NOTINDIA A COSSIO COURTAS WHEN YOU SAY TO THAT FOITHER HAS TA RIGHT OT TO DEFENDISELF AND ALSO OF COURSE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT IT'S WAR IN THE MAN OR CONSISTENT WITH THE INST ANASE THE RULES OF CONFLICT WE SHOULDN'T PUT CONDITIONS ON THE ABILITY OF ANY OF OUR ALLIES TO DEFEND THEMSELFS PUTTICTLY AGAINST THE RUTAL TERORIS RESIME LIKE HAMOSS HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME Y OF JAKESULLIVAN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER SAYING WE NEEDED TWO STATES SOLUTION AND THEY KEEP SAYING THIS OVER AND OVER AS TOUGH YOU CAN JUST WISHCAS STATES IN TO EXISTENCE WHICH IS TOTALLY CRAZY WITH WHOM WITH WHOM THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT THAT OUGHT TO BE A GOVERNMENT OF ANY SELF RESPECTING STATE THERE IS NO DE RADICALIZED POPULATION THE YOU RADICALIZE POPULATION IN PLACE LIKE TH GAZASTRIP AND LESS BANGUS LIKE TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION MAXIMUM MAXIMUM BUT THAT LUSY TALKING ABOUT YOU SEE ANY PROSPECT AT ALL THESE SEEMS TO'VE BEE RULING IT OUT PREV PREMINETION AND YAWHO OF SOME KIND OF

SINCE OCTOBER SEVENTH THE NEED TO WORK ON THAT I HAS ONLY INCREASE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO DELIVER AN OUT THAT'S SO OVER RAILING THE TASSON CREMSARY THAT'S SO CRAZY WE STOP IN THERE THAT'S SO NOTS WHEN HE SAYS THAT SINCE OCTOBER SEVENTH WE NEED TO GIVE MORE CONCESSIONS TO THE PEOPLE WHO ACTIVELY DID THE TERROR ATTACK THAT IS PREEMPTIVE SURRENDER THAT'S CRAZENAT'S LIKE ALL KIDA ATTACKS THE UNITED STATES ON IN ELEVIN AND HE US GOVERNMEN IMMEDIATELY SAYS WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOUASAMA LIKE WHAT AREYOUR DEMANDS YOU ONT OUR BASEIS OUT OF THE OUT ASALITY OK YOU KNOW IT MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT WE ANS IT ACCELERATE THAT WE N MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR YOU WAT IS  IT WHAT IN THE ACTUAL WENIA AND THE ANSWERS BEAUS N ORNATHIONA OF PLAN T MITALIES THEY DON'T THEIR PLAN IN THE THE LEAST IS TO FUTS AROUND NONSENSICALLY BEAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE MIDDLEEAST IN ANY REAL WAY SHAPE PERFORM AND WAT THAT AMOUNTS TO IS RANDOMLY LASHING OUT AT EMPTY BUILDINGS AND OCCASIONALLY HITTING A CAMEL IN THE ASS YELLING AT THES RAILIES THAT THEY PROBABLY SHOULD KILL FUR COMMOSS MEMBERS OR THAT URBAN WAR IS REALLY BAD AND WAR IS BAD YAL EVERY ONE KNOWS AND THEN MAKING WEIRD CONCESSION SIGNALS TO ARON LIKE THIS IS THEIR ACTUAL PLAN TDAIN ABASH CALLED JAKESALDAN ON THIS SHEUS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU KEEP SAYING THAT YOU DON'T WANTO ENTERINTO ORIGINAL CONFLICT IS THIS ALREADY ORIGINAL CONFLICT OR ON'S TERROR ARMS

A QUICK WARNING THERE ARE CURRS WORDS THAT ARE UNBEEPED INTERDATS APISODE OF THE SHOW IF YOU PREFER A BEEP RGION YOU CAN FIND THAT AT OUR WEBSITE THIS AMERICAN LIFE DAT AWORK FROM W B CHICAGO WITH THIS AMERICAN LIFE MY REQUIRES ITS BEEN SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY AND PAINFUL FEW WEEKS SINCE THE KILLING OF GEORGE FOY AND WE HAVE SHUD ADAY WITH PEOPLE IN SCENE SO WE RECORDED THIS PAST WEEK TRYING TO CAPTURE WHAT THIS MOMENT FEES LIKE ARD HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE REACTING AND WHAT THEY DOIN AND I KNOW USUALLY WRIT HERE AT THE TAP IF THE SHOW I JUMPRD HIM WITSOME STORY BUT I THINK IT ACTUALLY CAPTURES WHAT LATTER PEOPLE AR FEELING THIS WEEK A AT BETTER TO STRURT WITH THIS ESSAY FROM WHAT OF OUR PRODUCERIS BE A MATTER WOULD MA HI YES THE YEAR I CAME TO LIVE AND WORK IN AMERICA NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO PEOPLE WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY POLICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY I MAY BE THE NUMBER WAS ONE THOUSAND AND NINTY THREE IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK ABOUT TWENTY SIXTEEN ONE PROJECT THAT COUNTED THE DEAD FOUND THAT BLACK MALS AGED FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FOUR WHEN NINE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN OTHER AMERICANS TO BE KILLED BY LAW INFORCEMENT IN CASE YOU'VE BECOME FUZZY ON TIME LINES MICHAEL BROWN WAS SHOT BY POLICE IN FERGSON MISSOURI IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WALTER SCOT WAS SHOT IN THE BACK BY POLICE IN CHARLSTON SOUTH CAROLINA IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ALTON STERLING WAS KILLED BY POLICE IN BATON RUGE LOUISIANA AND A DAY LATER IN FALCONHEIDTS MINISOTA POLICE SHOT AND KILLED PHILANDO CASTILL WHILE HE WAS IN HIS CAR WITH HIS PARTNER AND AV FOR YOUR OLD DAUGHTER THOSE LAST TWO INCIDENTS WERE RECORDED BOTH WERE VIEWED BY THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AT THE TIME STERLING AND CASTILL WERE KILLED AND TWENTY SIXTEEN I AD BEEN LIVING IN NEW YORK FOR FOUR MONTHS I HAD COME TO AMERICA TO REPORT ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS WITH A RY BRITISH IE I NO LONGER HAVE THE ORIGINAL TEXT OF MY VESER APPLICATION BUT I REMEMBERE DISTINCTLY THAT IT MENTIONED BOTH THE NINETEENTH CENTURY FRENCH SOCIAL SCIENTIST ELEXUS TER TICKVILL AND THE LATE BRITISH JOURNALIST ALISTERCOOK TBOTH ELECUS AND ALISTER WERE AMEN OF LETTERS OPERATING IN VERY DIFFERENT ERRAS OF AMERICN UPHEVAL THE AIM OF THEIR WRITING WAS TO HELP READERS BACK HOME UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE AMERICAN SITUATION THEY WERE GOOD NAMES TO PUT ON O VESER APPLICATION IT INDICATED I KNEW MY LITERARY LINEAGE UT THE REALITY IS THAT BEYOND THE COMMON GROUND OF OUR JOBS I WASN'T REALLY LIKE ALEXUS OR ALISTER I MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY I WAS A WOMAN I WAS A MUSLIN I WAS A CHILD OF WORKING CLASS IMMIGRANTS BORNTS APPEARANCE WHO THEMSELVES WERE BORN IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY STILL UNDER THE YOKE OF THE ENGLISH MONARCHY AND OF COURSE I WAS BLACK I STILL AM THANKS TO THE SPREAD OF EMPIRE IM NO STRANGER TO THE PROJECT OF COLONIZATION OF ALL THE THINGS I WOULD BE REPORTING ON AND EXPERIENCING FIRST HAND IN AMERICA THE SUBJECT OF BLACKNESS WAS THE THING WITH WHICH I HAD THE MOST LITERAL MOST LIVED EXPERIENCE BRITISH POLICE HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT USCONS LIKE THEIR AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS BUT THE HISTORY OF DISPROPORTION AT BLACK DEATH DURING AND AFTER INTERACTIONS WITH POLICE IN THE UCE TELLS OF FAMILIAR STORY THE LYRICS A DIFFERENT BUT THE MELODY IS OLD UNKNOWN TO ME THAT'S THE HORRIBLE THING ABOUT THIS MOMENT I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE AND SO WHEN GEORGE FLOYD WAS KILLED AN MANY APPOLIS ON MEMORIAL DAY IN THE LAST WEEK OF MAY I HAD A FEELING OF RESINED DEJAVE POLICE HAD ARRESTED A MAN AND THEN LESS THAN A HALF HOUR LATER THAT MAN WAS DEAD THE MANNER OF IT A COP'S NEE PRESSIN DOWN ON HIS NECK FOR EIGHT MINUTES AND FORTY SIX SECONDS FELT LIKE A STAGE PLAY WE'D ALL SEEN BEFORE THE FACT THAT IT HAD BEEN RECORDED FELT PROPER LIKE A SORT OF SACRED PRACTICE THE MONDAY IN LOCATION OF IT WAS FAMILIAR TOO A REGULAR STREET SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED INTO AN ARENA FOR PUBLIC DEATH THE ECHO OF SOME OF FLOYD'S DYING WORDS ERIALLY THE SAME AS ERIC GARNERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I CAN'T BREED EVEN THAT FELT LIKE AN ONTHE NOSARY RUN OF A SERIES CALLED HOW TO DIE IN AMERICA ALMOST EVERY ELEMENT OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT HID THE EXACT BEAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO THE VIDIO OF HIS LIFE BEING SNUFFED OUT WENT VIRAL TABLOYD NEWSPAPERS BROUGHT UP HIS CRIMINAL PAST PROTEST BEGAN THE DAY AFTER HE WAS KILLED AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY YES BAT ALSO AGAINST THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE OF COLONIALISM IN GENERAL AND EXPLICITLY AGAINST THE IDEOLOGY OF WHITE SUPPREMISY ITSELF AND IT WASN'T JUST BLACK PEOPLE YELLING THINGS SHIFTED SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT BY THE END OF THE WEEK THERE WERE PROTESTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALL FIFTY STATES AND A WEEK AFTER THAT THEY'D BEEN PROTEST IN OTHER COUNTRIES TOO LAST WEEKAIND I WATCH PROTESTERS IN THE WEST OF ENGLAND TOPAL THE STATUE OF EDWARD COULSTON A BRISTEL MAN WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE BY TRADING IN THOUSANDS OF ENSLAVED AFRICANS AFTER KNEELING ON THE SUPINE STATUES NECK PROTESTORS ROLLED IT DOWN THE STREET BEFORE TIPPING IT INTO THE BRISTOL HARBOUR MY LONDON FRIEND SENT ME VIDDIOS AND POTERS OF PROTEST THEY HAD ATTENDED WHILE DOING THEIR BEST TO MAINTAING SOCIAL DISTANCING A SOME ONE UNTWITTER PUT IT I CAN'T BELIEVE CORONA BLE ARE TWENTY EIGHT THREE LEADES TO RASISON THE DAY AFTER GEORGE FLOYD WAS KILLED I QUICK TWITTER BECAUSE OF MY PROPENSITY FOR DOOMS GROWLING I KNEW MY RIGHT THOMB WOULD BE IN CONSTANT ENDLESS MOTION EATING UP BREAKING NEWS THAT WOULD LAYTO CRISTELLIZE INTO INSOMNIA AND MY GRAINS BUT EVEN ON INSTEGRAM IT WAS A WALL OF GEORGE FLOD CONTENT SUDDENLY I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH GRAPHICS AND PHOTOS AND LINKS TO BALE FONDS AND THAT UNIQUELY AMERICAN HABIT CROWD FUNDING AND PASTEL COLOUR DID ITTAL EASELS PEOPLE WROTE ANTIRASE HIS QUOTES FROM ANGELADAVIS AND EACH O MA OLOUO ARTIST CREATED TRIBUTES TO PEOPLE LIKE TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD BRIONE TAILOR WHO WAS KILLED IN HER OWN HOME IN LORVALL KENTUCKY BACK IN MARCH AND TONY MC DADE A TRANSMAN KILLED IN TALLAHASSY THERE WERE GUIDES ON EVERYTHING FROM HOW TO DRESS AND PREPARE FOR A PROTEST IN THE AGE OF CORONA VIRIS TO THE SPECIFICS OF RAISING TRULY AN TE RACES CHILDREN MY FAVORITE OR LEAST FAVORITE JONRA OF THESE IS THE ONE THAT TEACHERS NON BLACK PEOPLE HOW TO BE PEOPLE IN THIS MOMENT POST WITH HEADINGS LIKE HERE'S WHAT TO SAY TO YOUR BLACK FRIENDS OR CHECK IN ON YOUR BLACK FRIENDS WAS SEEMINGLY EVERYWHERE AFTER THAT FIRST WEEK END OF PROTEST I GOT A TEXT IN ONE OF MY GROUP CHATS FROM A BLACK FRIEND HAVE EITHER REV YIEW GOTTEN TEX FROM WHITE PEOPLE THIS WEEKEND SHE WROTE YES WE BOTH REPLIED WE ALL SHARED A DARK LAUGH LIKE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DYING IN AMERICA AND ELSEWHERE FOR SO LONG WHAT SO DIFFERENT ABOUT NOW THAT FIRST WEEKAIN I KEPT ASKING MY SOFETHIS WHAT' MAKING WHITE PEOPLE CARED NOW I KEOPE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT I'VE MISS WHAT WAS THE THING THAT' MAKING BRANDS O DRAW THESE LINES NOW WHAT MAKES BABY NAMES DOCK CALM DEDICATE ITS LANDING PAGE TO LISTING BLACK VICTS UMS OF POLICE VIOLENCS A LONG WITH THE NOTE EACH ONE OF THESE NAMES WAS SOMEBODY'SE BABY BABY NAMES DOCK CAM STANDS AN SOLID ARITY WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHAT IST COMPELLING PEOPLE A LOT OF THEM WHITE TO STAND UP FOR THE FIRST TIME AND PROCLAIM THAT IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING HOW WAS IT THAT I HAVE READ MORE PROPOSALS FOR DEFUNDING AND ABOLISHING THE POLEACES IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS THAND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS WHAT'S MAKING PEOPLE IN SMALL TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA LEWIS TOWN MONTANA TO BAD ACE MICHIGAN GET UP AND PROTEST NOW IF S SANTRA BLANDS DIDN'T DO IT IF ERICK GARNA DIDN'T DO IT IF ATATIANA JEFFERSON DIDN'T DO IT IF I ANDA STANLEY JONES DIDN'T DO IT HOW WAS THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD THE THING THAT MOVES THE NEEDLE I CAN'T THINK OF AN EASY ANSWER IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD LIF I ANA STANLEY JONES WAS IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE WAS A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY LIKE TO ME A RICE WS IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE WAS AN AWARD WENNIN E M T WHO TWEATED THAT TWENTY TWENTY WOULD BE HER YEAR LIKE BRIANA TAILOR WAS SO THE NEXT LIKELY ANSWER IS THAT IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THE EFFECT OF ACCUMULATION FINALLY THERE ARE ENOUGH DOESY CLOTHES IN THE HAMPER TO JUSTIFY PUTTING ON A LOAD OF LAUNDRY MAYBE THE INCREASED VISIBILITY OF THE STARK DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS PRODUCED A POPULACE READY TO BE PUSHED INTO THE HITHERTO RADICAL LANE OF THOUGHT THAT'S SUGGESTS ACTUALLY BLACK LIVES DO MATTER MAYBE THE ACT OF HIS FINALLY BROKE THROUGH WHO CAN SAY A PARTS OF ME WNT WHITE PEOPLE AT LARGE TO FEEL DEEPLY ASHAMED THIS IS ENTRY LEVEL STOPP KILLING US THIS IS BASIC IF THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOID COULD UNLEACH THIS TITLE WAVE OF DEMONSTRATION WHAT WAS STOPPING YOU BEFORE HE'S AS MEETING FUL AS ANY OTHER VICTIM OF POLICE VIOLENCE NAMED UNNAMED HERE TO DAY YOU COULD HAVE HARNESSED ALL THIS ENERGY FIFTEEN TWENTY TWO HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED A THOUSAND DEATHS AGO BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND SO WHEN I ASK THE QUESTION WHY NOW THE TRUTH IS THAT I DON'T REALLY CARE ALL THESE WHITE PEOPLE NEWLY ATTUNED TO THIS FREQUENCY THE REST OF US KNOW SO WELL I TOLD A FRIEND THAT I WANT TED EVERY ONE TO DO THEIR BELATED LEARNING FAR AWAY FROM ME I DON'T WANT TO SEE HOW ANY ONE IS CARRYING THE ONE I DON'T WANT TO TEACH ANY ONE I HAVE NO OFFICE HOURS I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT TRIGGAD YOU COME TO JESUS MOMENT I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SEEING HOW THE SAUSAGE GETS MADE I JUST WANT TO ROCK UP TO THE TABLE AND ENJOY MY BREAKFAST I KNOW WHAT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME I'M ANGRIER NOW I THINK OF WHAT PARENTS SAY IBOUT HOW THEI HARTS GROW BIGER AFTER A SECOND CHILD INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SHARE THE LOVE THEY ALREADY FEEL THAT'S ME BUT INSTEAD OF LOVE IT'S RAGE I FIND THAT

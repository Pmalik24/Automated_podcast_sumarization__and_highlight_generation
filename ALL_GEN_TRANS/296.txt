CHANNELS PLAYING AND REPLAYING THE REFT'S MISTAKES SO THEIR VIEWERS CAN TWEET AND RETWEET ABOUT HEM IT'S THIS ENTIRE INFOR STRUCTUR  SEEMINGLY BUILT THE FOCUS ATTENTION ON WHATEVER MISTAKES THE REFT'S MAKE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GENERATING ORA THERE'S ONE THING THAT OU NIGHTS AMERICANS JUST NOW IT'S THEIR BELIEF THAT THE REFT SUCK WHICH IS WERD BECAUSE THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY SUCK LESS THAN EVER BEFORE BEFORE YOU HATE ME FOR SAYING THAT GIVE ME A MOMENT TO SHOW WHY SO WERE WALK ACROSS A PARKIN LOT IN SCAUCUS NEW JERSEY AND THERE CHAIN HOTEL IN MOTELS IN SOME ONE'S IDEA OF AM ALL AND WIS RATE ON ALL SIDES BY FREEWAYS IT'S LIKE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY TELL JOKES ABOUT NEW GERS A AND  THE PRUSHING AA FORE STORY RECTANGULAR OTHERWISE NON DESCRIPT CONCRETE BUILD THERE'S A DISCREET LITTLE SIGN HERE THAT SAYS N B A AND SHOWS A LOGO WITH HE BASKETBALL PLAYER INSIDE A RECENT CONSESSION TO THE WORLD WE LIVE IN THE REPLAC CENTER A PLACE WHERE BASKETBALL REFEREES REVIEW THE CALLS MADE BY OTHER BASKETBALL REFERES IN REAL TIME TO MINNIMIZE REFERE ERRAR ROW THE REPLAY CENTER WAS BUILT TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT LIFE WAS FAIR AND THE DOOR IS LOCKED I NO NO SOME ONE EVENTUALLY UNLOCKS THE DOOR AND LEADS ME DOWN A HALL FILLED WITH A LOT OF OLD BASKETBALL STUFF JERSY IS IN BOBBLE HEADS IN BASKETBALLS AND POSTERS OF MICHAEL JORGAN THE REPLAY CENTER WHERE THE ALTIMAT MAN CAVE I MA GAME IT'S ALSO THE LATEST WEAPON IN THE BATTLE FOR FAIRNESS SO THIS PLACE JUST ON FIRST VO IS AMAZING IT REALLY IT'S WALL TO WALL SCREENS ONE HUNDRED AND TEN OF THEM HIT'S ON THEM IS WHATEVER IS CAPTURED BY ALL THE CAMERAS IN TWENTY NINE ENV A ARENAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY MAY HAVE A SCREEN SOMEWHERE WITH SCORES ON IT BUT I DIDN'T SEE IT AND THEY'RE ALL MUTED WHICH YOU HER IS REFEREES STARING AT BASKETBAL GAMES WHICH YOU SEE IS NOTHING BUT ANGLES ON PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL CORTS NOBODY'S HOVE A WALKED IN HERE WALK OWNSIDE IS PLAC SUCK THAT'S JOE BORGIA WHOSE RUN THE CENTER SON'S TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN SBEFORE HE VOLUNTEERED FOR A SACAUCUS DONE HE REFEREDE ANB A GAMES HIS FATHER WAS AN ENVI A REFT BEFORE HIM WITH BREAK IN THE LATE SIXTIES A BORGIA HAS BEEN REFFING PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL GAMES SINCE NINETEEN FORTY SIX IF YOU WENT BACK TO YOUR DAD AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER AND SAID THIS IS WHAT ITS CAT LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU THINK HET A SAID IF I TOLD THEM WE WOULD HAVE REPLAT ETERNALVERAN IS GRAY FORGET ABOUT A REPLACE CENTER IT'S AT RIGHT O ABSENT YOU SEE THE REFT USED TO INSIST ON THEIR AUTHORITY AND EVERY ONE AGREED THAT THERE WAS NO BETTER WAY TO INSURE THE FAIRNESS OF THE GAME THAN TO LET THE REFT PLAY GOD THE REPLAC CENTER IS AN ADMISSION THE REFT IS NOT GOD THAT HE MAKES MISTAKES I THINK THE MENTION OF REPLAY NONE OF US LIKE THEM WON WE FIRST HEARD IT IT'S A NECESSARY EVEN IT'S NECESSENT YOU HALF TO HALF IT TO TAT EVERYTHING'S TAPE NOW EVERY ONE PAYS MORE ATTENTION TO THE REFEREES MISTAKES SO THE ENB HAS TO AS WELL NOW WHEN A REFT THINKS HE MIGHTHAVE SCREWED UP SOME CALL OR DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE ACTIONS WHAT'H THE REFFREON  BOTOMA SCRETHE TWIRLS HIS FINGERS IN THE AIR THERE OU SU THAT'S THE SIGNAL TO THE REFT IN THE REPLAC CENTER WHO GOES TO WORK REVIEWING THE TAPE LOOKING FOR THE BEST ANGLE TO FIGURE OUT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN JERDER REE E YOU GOD AI  L W  THAT'S THE FIRST ONE THE OTHER ON YOU  G GO  THE REFTS HERE SIT DRESSED IN BLACK STARING AT SCREENS WAITING FOR A SIGNAL FROM SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA  THE END OF GAMES IS WHEN THEY GET MOST INVOLVED BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN FANS AND COACHES AND PLAYERS A MOST LIKELY TO A CU SOME WRET OF HAVING MADE THE MISTAKE THE CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF COURSE A MISTAKE AT THE BEGINNING HAS JUST AS MUCH EFFECT ON A GAME AS A MISTAKE AT THE END BUT THE END IS WHAT PEOPLE NOTI IS AND GET OUTRAGED ABOUT SO THE JUSTICE THAT THE END OF THE GAME MUST BE MORE EXACT THAN IT IS AT THE BEGINNING THE'S REPLACE TAT A REFTS HAVE VIDIO TECHNICIANS WITH HIM WHO CAN FREEZE A MOMENT ON SCREEN THEN ZUME OUT RESUME IN SO THAT THE ENTIRE SCREEN CONTAINS ONLY A PLAYER'S FINGER TIPS OR IS TOES HERE YOU JUST SCROLL THROUGH TINY SLIVERS OF THE GAME NOT THE GAME ITSELF THE SLIVER IS WEARYING JUSTICES MIGHT O CUR BUT IN GOOD DE SCRACE IS TIF YOU DON HAV SLOW MOTION AND HER FREES FRAN S VERY DIFFECLT THE COURSE IN SLOW MOTION YOU CAN SEE THINGS THAT THE NAKED I MISSES MAGICIANS SOMETIMES PERFORM DURING HALF TIMES OF THE ENVI A GAMES WHEN JOE BORE JUST SLOWS IT DOWN HE CAN SEE HOW THEY DO THEIR TRICKS IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING WITH THE PLAYERS EXACTLY I  A AS SIXTIOTH OF THE SECKIN OF THE TIME ST IS O TIK A LOW LOBLE I SO THET THESE PLAYERS ARE GETTING GOOD AT ITS GREAT OCTICAL ALLUSIONS IT THET A CESTIE SORT F THE SORT OF THINGS AN A MAGICIAN DT ALL ISN'T SLOPPING AN OPTICAL ILLUSION FLOPPING IS WHAT THEY CALL IT WHEN A PLAYER PRETENDS TO AVE BEEN KNOCKED OVER BY ANOTHER PLAYER  TRICKING THE REFTS INTO MAKING BAD CALLS IS NOW CONSIDER DESILL THE POSSIBLE FANGER  THERE'S BLOOD ON THE SCREENS KEAVEN LOVES FRONT TOOTH GOT KNOCKED IN LOVE PLAYS FOR THE CLEAVELIND CAVALIERS AND THE QUESTION IS DI THE GUY WHO POPPED HIM IN THE MOUTH DO IT INTENTIONALLY WE'RE LOOK CINFER THE ONMATTUAL TDIY  THROW IS ELBOW OUT THE RESTS NEED O DECIDE IF THE VIOLENCE WAS NOT JUST EXCESSIVE BUT UNSPORTSMAN LIKE WHICH SOUNDS OUR CA AUSE WE SORT OF LOST THE CONCEPT SO THE FOULER WE THE FOUERS ON CATALOP  IT THAT HE WAS OUT AS ID WON'T HERES MOTIN OSLY AM I O  QUICK ONDE  NO IN BLIK IM THAT YET SUGLY THE PLAYERS ALL STAND AROUND SCRATCHING THEMSELVES WHILE THE REFTS PUT ON HEADSETS AND TALK TO THE REPLAC CENTER SO THE BLOOD DOESN'T SLENDE DECISION  WAT AT I LON CONBACT O LOTO WIT AX AN OU I WITHAXI THE ONLY THING STOPP IN THE REPLACE CENTER FROR CHECKING EVERY DECISION IS THAT IT SLOWS THE GAME DOWN HERE IN SICAUCAS THEY STILL TRYNG TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY MIGHT TALK TO THE REFTS AS THEY RUN UP AND DOWN THE COURT CAUSE IF THEY COULD DO THAT TO GOU JUST FIX EVERY CALL ON THE FLY THE SPESCIAL FORCES WE FOUND AUT WE ACTUALLY USE A CHIPOL FROM THE BOWLER THAT WORK OFF THE VIBRATION ON THE BALL LEVEN NOT WE THAT WE WE GOT A HANDFUL OF GENY RE FRES ALDED AND WE TEST TE THAT TO WEAR CHIP OVER THEIR MOE BUT IIT WASN'T OD ENOUGH BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE VOICE WAS COMING IT AS UST A PLACE IN THEIR HEADS IT IN A WARR ONE I THAT A COAKS COCKET  GETS INSAME  THE TIME AND MONEY NOW BEING SPENT TO INSURE THE FAIRNESS OF WHAT AFTER ALL IS JUST THE BASKETBALL GAME A JILIAN MILES THE FIBRA OPTIC CABLE CONNECT THIS ROOM DIRECTLY TO THE ENVI ARENAS AROUND THE COUNTRY ALL FOR TWO CALLS AGAIN AT TWO CALLS AGAN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD E   TWO CALLS QECTY GAN BUT YOU GOT TO DO IT E GOT TO DO IT CAN I JUST PAUS HERE A MOMENT JUST TO CONSIDER WHAT THE ENVIA HAS DONE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS TO IMPROVE THE CALLS FOR EXAMPLE THEY BROUGHT IN SERIOUS MANAGERS TO HIRE AND TRAIN THE REFT JO BORGER CALLS HIS BALLS THE GENERAL BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY WAS A GENERAL END INEAR FORCE PILOT HER NAME IS MICHELL JOHNSON AND BEFORE SHE SUPERVIZED ENBE A REFT SHE RAN THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY IT SOUNDS LIKE OVERKILL TO USE A GENERAL TO MAKE SURE BASKETBALL GAMES AR WELL REFTBUT THE ENBI A THOUGHT IT NEEDED OVERKILL SAIJUSTER MICE THE ORE AT LEAST ATAM SILVER THE ENVIA COMMISSIONER DID IF PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE LEAG OFFICE IS UNBIASTAN THAT THE OFFICIALS ARE ON BYUS YOU CAN HAVE ER PROBEM REGARDLESS OF THE ACRACY OF THE CALLS PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME WERE SCRUTINIZEING EVERY CALL ON THEIR PHONES AND THEIR TEVES THEY AD JUST ENOUGH INFORMATION TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF THE LEAGUE THERE IS EIGHTEE N CAMERAS COVERING EVERY GAME THAT THERE'S EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WATCHING GAMES WITH SUFFISTICATED SMARTFALNS THAT HAVE HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO AN VIDIO WE STARTED TO GET INTO TROUBLE SILVER TOOK OVER IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AND ALL SO HIRED JOE BORGER TO RUN THE REPLACE CENTER SINCE THEN HE'S TAKEN A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF GRIEF JUST FOR TRYING TO IMPROVE THE JUSTICE ON A BASKETBALL COURT SO HERE'S WHAT ELSE SILVER IS DONE HE'S BROUGHT EN THE POOL OF PEOPLE FROM WHICH REFTS ARE SELECTED THEY USE TO BE MOSTLY WHITE MEN MOSTLY FROM THE SAME BACK RAT AT ONE POINT FOR N B A REFT CAME FROM THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL HE'S HIRED MORE BLACK REFTS AND FEMALE RAFTS HE'S INSISTED THAT REFERES BE PHYSICALLY FIT SO THEY CAN GET INTO POSITION TO SEE ALL THE PLAYS WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA'S GETTING FATTER THE RFTS ARE GETTING BUFF THEY'RE ALSO NOW GETTING NEW FEED BACK ON ALL THEIR BAD CALLS SILVER DECIDED TO PUBLISH THE MISTAKES MADE BY EVERY REFT IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES OF EVERY GAME SO EVERYONE COULD SEE THEM HE GIVES THE TEAMS AND THE REFTS A PRIVATE DOCUMENT LISTING EVERY REFERING MISTAKE ALL THIS NEW DATA ON REFTS MEANS THAT WE AN THEY NOW ALL SORTS OF STRANS THINGS ABOUT THEIR MINDS FRINCES WE NOW KNOW THAT THEIR CALLS HAVE TENDED TO FAVOR WHICH EVER TEAMS LOSING THE CALLS ALSO FAVOR THE HOME TEAM SOME LARGE PART OF HOME COURT ED VANTAGE IS JUST THE REFTS THE ANALYTICS DEPARTMENT OF THE USTON ROCKETS HAS EVEN DONE A STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT THE HOME TEAM THAT GETS THE BEST CALLS IS THE UTAW JABS WHY YOU TALK WHO KNOWS BUT YOU CAN BE SURE THAT SOME ONE WILL FIGURE THAT OUT THE'S NOW BASICALLY A SMALL ARMY OF GEEKS ANALYZING ALL THIS NEW DATA OOUDERN'T REALLY LIKE RIDING PIPE IS ABOUT SPORTS FEDERAT IN VAT THE ECONOMY THAT'S JUST IN WULFERS A BEHAVIORAL ECONOMISTS AT THE UNIVERSY OF MICHIGAN AND THE CO AUTHOR OF A PAPER ABOUT ENB A REFTS BUT THE THINGIS DISISA DEMAN WAY THE INBIA REFERIES HAV TREMENDOUSIN SENDEMS NOT TO MAKE THE WRONG COL I'M EVERY ERROR THEY MAKE IS TRACT THUS EIR IS DETERMINED WHETER THEY GET MOL GAME THUGE GAMES DETERMINED HOW MUCH THEY GET PITE THIS IS OGUABLY THE MOST ANALYZED WORK FORSE IN THE COUNTRY BASKET BALL REFEREES ARE NOW PICKED UP PART IN WAYS THAT NOT LONG AGO WOULD HAVE SEEM PREPOSTEROUS NOT JUST FOR THE FAIRNESS OF THEIR CALLS BUT FOR THEIR UNCONSCIOUS BEHAVIOR WULFERIS TOOK DATA FROM OVER A DECADE OF ENB A BASKETBALL GAMES MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM THEN HE SET OUT TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF THE REFT'S RACIEL BY US THE QUESTION HERE ISN'T WHETHER PEOPLE ARE AIN'TY BLACK OR AN'TY WHITE BUT WHETTHERS AN INGRIT BYUS SO I'M IF IT IF E PREDOMENTLY BLACK TEAM IS PLAYING AND THE REFERING CREW IS PREDOMENTLY WHITE  THEY MOLFALS CALLED AGAINST THEM THAN ON NIGHTS WHEN THE SAME TAM IS PLAYING WETTHE PODOMENTLY BLACK REFERIN CREW IN IT SUNS AT THE ANSWERS YES WULFERS WROTE HIS PAPER BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BEFORE THIS NEW AGE OF REFEREE TRANSPARENCY WELL IT WAS A BIT OF LESSIN FAMAI YOU CAN PRUBLY TOLD BY MY ACCENT MOCALOM AN AUSTRALIAN I THAG IT WAS INTRIETING PACE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE TURNED OUT THE  THE NEAL TIMES PUT ON THE FRONT PIGE AND THE ENB A WASN'T HAPPY THE COMMISSIONER AT THE TIME ATTACK THE STUDY AND EMBARRASS THE LEAGUE BY TRYING AND FAILING TO REFUTE ITS FINDINGS THIS MORNING WELL HEAR FROM THE EN BE A COMMISSIONER DAVIDS STERN I REFEREE OT THE MOST REVEWED MOST RANK AT MOS RATED AND THAT WHY WE TAKE ECEPTION TO WHAT THE TIMES ID HERE THAT STIRRED ON EN PIAR IN TWO THOUSAND IN SEVEN THE RESULT OF ALL THIS COVERAGE EVERY SINGLE REFEREE WAS MADE AWARE OF HIS UNCONSCIOUS BY US WHEN THE DUST SETTLED JUST IN WULFERS WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW IF HIS PAPER HAD HAD ANY EFFECT HE MADE ANOTHER STUDY OF REFERE'S AFTER THE CONTROVERSY HE'D CREATED AN GUESS WHAT THE MISTRATION STUDY THAT WE DID SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT THAT FOM OF RICIAL BY US IS GONE A WHYET FOR A WHILE ANYWAY HE HAS NO IDEA WHY MAYBE SIMPLY MAKING THE R T'S AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WAS ENOUGH TO CORRECT IT BY THE WAY THE ENBIA DISPUTES THE STUDY TOO BUT IN THE END THIS BECAME A CASE STUDY NOT IN REF AN APTITUDE BUT IN REGH REFORM IN BE A RAFTHS IF NOW ACHIEVED WHET POLICE FORCONS CAN ONLY DREAM OF THOUGH THE RAFTHS HAVE NO CHOICE THE WORLD'S NOW TOO GOOD AT SEEING THEIR MISTAKES LOOK THERE'S NO WAY ANY BASKETBALL REFEREES CAN BE PERFECT BUT THERE'S ALSO NO WAY THESE REFTS OR ANYTHING BUT MORE ACCURATE THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN I MEAN EVEN WHOME COURT ADVANTAGE MEANS LESS THAN USED TO AND YET THESE REFTS ARE TREATED AS IF THE'RE TRYING TO RING THE GAMES IT'STHE SOUND OF THOSE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE SCREAME ATTER AR BOOING YOU DI THE SOUND ANY DIFFERENT THAN IT SOUNDED WHEN YOU STARTED Y THERE'S THERE'S A LITTLE MORE ANGER INVOLVE THAN YOU KNOW IT USED TO BE SORT O OF THE GARDEN VARIETY YOU TERRIBLE YOU SAWK ANY OF THOSE KINDS OF TERMS THAT'S MONY MC CUTCHEN WHO START A REFING IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND SO GOT TO SEE FIRST HAND THE EFFECT THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE INNER NET HAS HAD ON REFERIES A FEW YEARS BACK I TWITTER EXPLODED AND GAME FIVE OF OF THE MIMY HEAT NO CAMA CITY AH THUNDER AR FINALS FROM YEARS AGO ONE OF THE PLAYERS HIT A THREE POINT SHOT MC CUTCHEN WAS

HAVE EVEN NOTICED IF THEY DID IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED THAT'S CHANGED MISTAKES GET MADE IS IN BE A REFEREES AND THEY'RE JUST MISTAKES BUT THEY OFTEN GET INTERPRETED IN THIS THIS WIDER SCHEME OF THOUGHT PROCESS THAT A LOT OF OUR CULTURES I'S DEALING WITH RIGT NOW WHICH IS THERE MUST BE A FIX HIM THERE MUST BE A REASON FOR THIS DO YOU THINK THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR A FIXED MORE NOW THAT IT WAS WHEN YOU STARTED IM I THINK THAT THE TE SHIRT I SAW RECENTLY HAS MERIT I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOUR FAULT I'M SAYING I'M BLAMING YOU HE FEEL ABUSED YEH NOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE DO THEIR RESEARCH THEY THETHINGS

DEAT THREATS ARE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AND PLAY OFF SERIES AND YOU'LL GET SECURITY ALL THE WAY TO TO BOTH THE HOTEL AND THEN THE HOTEL THE NEXT MORNING OUT TO THE AIRPORT THEY SECURITY TO THE HOTEL NOT EVERY NIGHT BUT WHEN THOSE THREATS ARE OR UNKNOWN FACTOR IT HAS HAPPENED IN MY CEREER I'LL SECURITY TO YOUR CAR IS MANDITORY EVERY NIGHT IT'S SOME POINT YOU FEEL THIS QUESTION RISING UP IN YOU IN ME IT ROSE UP WHILE I WAS TALKING TO REMOTA SHELBURN THE YS PIAN REPORTER WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TA BE A RAFT SERIOUSTHY I WONDER THAT TOO YOU KNOWITEY THE'RE NOT A LOT TI TAY ANYTHING HEY'RE NOT A LOT TOF EXPLAIN HEMSELVES AND NOT A LOT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES LOOK OBVIOUSLY TH HEY GET PAID THEY STARTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY GRAND A YEAR AND IF THEY'RE GRATE AT THEIR JOB AND WORK EXTRA GAMES THEY CAN MAKE AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED BUT THER'RE LOTS OF WAYS TO GET PAID WITHOUT SPENDING HALF YOUR LIFE IN HOTEL ROOMS AND THE OTHER HALF BEING INSULTED BY A RENAS FILLED WITH CRAZY PEOPLEDO YOU THINK THE REFERINGS GOTTEN WORSE OR BETTER I SHOU THING AS GOTTEN BETTER OF COURSE IT'S GOTTEN BETTER HOW COULD IT NOT HAVE THE MYSTERY IS WHY THE STARS AN THE COACHES IN THE FANS ACTINS IF IT'S GOTTEN WORSE SITTING IN THE IND BEA REPLACE CENTER AN SOM CALCUS NEW JERSEY I GET A HUNTRED BY THAT U AFTER I SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE ON ALL THESE TEVE SCREENS JUMPING AROUND AND HOLERING AT REFT THE RUCHAS APPEARS TO BE CONFINED TO CLEVELAND BUT IN HERE IT FEELS LIKE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS DISTURBED THERE'S A REASON FOR THIS LE BRON JAMES IS UPSET SHEK 'S ARGUMENT THERE YOS WHYN JEU'S GOING FROM RESHE REFT E SHINGS TO KNOW WHICH REST TO ARGUMEIT WITH ARM A GOLTANT SO THERE TALKON BO THER YON ER MAN I THINK THER MIGH CHANS THE CHAMGEES CHANGES AN ENOTHER YO HAD T BEST ANGLE YOU THINK THIT IWE BROD JANES HAS ANY EFFECT DOING THAT OH THE RUGH AN CLEVELAND IS NOT TWIRRELING HIS FINGER THERE'S NO SIGNAL TO US TO DO ANYTHING IN THE REPLACE CENTER THE BRONZE DRAMA STRICTLY SPEAKING IS POINTLESS IT'S STRANGE THE WAY THESE PLAYERS ARGUE THEY MUST THINK THAT IF THEY MAKE LIFE UNPLEASANT ENOUGH FOR THE REFT YOU'LL THINK TWICE BEFORE THE NEXT CALLIN EVIEWIN THAT BONTNG YOU SIR IT'S THEN THAT IT OCCURS TO ME JUST LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM AT A HUNDRED AND TEN TVES SCREENS I'VE HAD A HARD TIME FOLLOWING THE GAMES NEVER MIND THE SCORES I SOMETIMES DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH TEAMS ARE PLAYIN  BUT EVERY TIME UP PLAYER GETS UP INTO A REFERES FACE I'VE RECOGNIZE THE PLAYER AND I ACTALLY DON'T KNOW THAT MANY ANBEING PLAYERS BUT I KNOW ALL THE ONES WHO PITCH THESE HISY FITS BUTCAUSE THE ONLY PLAYERS GETTING UP INTO THE FACES OF THE REFTS ARE THE FAMOUS PLAYERS OR THE COACHES WHO PROTECT THEM REMONA SHELBERN PUT HER FINGER ON IT THE MORE AGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR TOWARDS REFT ISN'T COMING FROM EVERY PLAYER IT'S COMING FROM THE STARS IT'S JUST DIFFERENT THEN IN THE PASS LIKE AND WHEN YOU'RE A STAR I THINK THERE'S THIS FEELING THT YOU SORT OF RISEN ABOVE REPROACH YOU GET USED TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF TREATMENT YOU GET USED TO PEOPLE WHO TREAT YOU THAT WAY AND THEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY THEY'V SO REFERE AN REFERETE TO THAT PERSON COMES AS A SHELK OH YAH NOW IT'S WWHEN AT WITH ANY STAR IN ANY CELEBRITY THERE COMES A LEVEL OF ENTITLE ME SO ANYBODY WHO GOES AGAINST THAT WHO DOESN'T TREAT YOU LIKE A STAR IT'S PUT IN TO THAT HATER CATEGORY TYOU WONT O UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE REFTS ARE TREATED  STOP THINKING OF THEM AS PEOPLE JUST DOING THEIR BEST TO TRY TO MAKE A GAME FAIR AND START THINKING OF THEM AS HATERS SO WE JUST GOT REALLY INTERESTED A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION OF DAS THIS SENSE OF BEING PRIVILEGE MAKE YOU DISOBEY THE RULES OF THE ROAD OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND THAT'S DACKER KELTNER HE'S A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT CAW BERKELY AND SOME ONE WHO WONDERS ABOUT THE EFFECT INEQUALITY HAS ON PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR IT EXPERIENCE I HAD IT BERKLEY WHERES RITIN MY BACK UP THIS HILL AND I AND I GOT TO THE FORKA STOPS IN AND I WAS HALF WAY THROUGH THI FORWAY STOPS ON THE SKY AN A BLACK PORCEEDIS ROLLS THROUGH THE STOPSIIT'S HALF WAY THERE IT'S A FOOT AWAY FROM YOU ABOUT TO TAKE ME OUT HE'S ON ITSELFA AND I LOOKED AT IM I I DREAD TO TAKE HIM ON LIKE ARIBODY THIS IS TIT AND AND WHAT WAS MOST TELLING ABOUT THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS HE LOOKED AT ME AS IF I WAS IN THE WRONG AND I SHOULD GET OUT OF HIS WAY YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I'D MADE IT TROUGH THE STOPSINE FIRST SO DACKER IN A COLLEAGUE DREAMED UP THIS WEIRD EXPERIMENT THEY HID TWO BERKLEY UNDER RADUATES IN THE BUSHES NEAR FOUR WAY STOPSINS THE UNDER GRADS NOTED THE MAKES OF ALL CARS COMING THROUGH THE INTERSECTION THE SIGN THEM NUMBERS ONE TO FIVE ACCORDING TO THEIR MARKET VALUE A NEW MERSCADES WAS A FIME BEHOND O WAS A THREE AND AN OLD PACER WAS A ONE WE POSITION O BIRK THE UNDER GRAD BUY A PEDESTRIAN ON AND WE MAKE SURE THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WAN ACROSS THE STREET A THERE SORT OF LEANING IN TO THE PEDESTRIAN OWN WHERE IT'S REQUIRED BY CALIFORNIA LAW TO STOP IT'S A GAME OF ONE ON ONE THE CALIFORNIA CROSSWALK ONE CAR VERSES ONE PEDESTRIAN AND A ZERO PERCENT OF THE DRIVERS OF POOR CARS A ZUM THROUGH THE PEDESTRIANS ON THEY ALL STOP AND FORITY SOME ODD PERCENT FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE DRIVERS IF THE FINE THAN FIVES TAID RICH CARS BLAZE THROUGH THE PEDESTRIAN O AND YOU SAY THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO ME I'LL CARRY O OTHIS ONE STUDY LED TO A BUNCH OF OTHERS THAT SHOWED BASICALLY THE SAME PATTERN OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR NOWTHEIR EXPERIMENT WE BRING PEOPLE TO THE LAD AND AS THEIR LEAVING A THERE'S THIS BIG BALL OF CANDY AND IT'S LIKE IT IT SAYS ON IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE INSTITUTE OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AON THE BALL AND WE HAW YUN T TIKE A CANDIR TIF Y AS YOU'RE LEAVING AND WELL TO WE COUNT UP HOW MANY CANDIES THEY TAKE AFTER THEY IIGFARMET PRIVILEGE PEOPLE GRAB A BIG HANDFUL OF CANDY COMPARED TO POORER PEOPLE SO LET'S TURN THE CONVERSATE SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTAI'S BASKETBALL MOST TE PARDON OF ALL IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS THE ENBIE IS EMBARKED ON ESSENTIALLY A DRAMATIC REFORM OF REFERING AT THE SAME TIME THE FRICTION BETWEEN THE PLAYERS AND SOME OF THE OWNERS AND SOME O THE COACHES YE AND THE REFTS ITS GOING THROUGH THE ROUTE A THE SOURCE OF THE OUT RAGE IS THE STAR PLAYERS O PEOPLE GETTING THROWN OUT A GAMES ARE CAVIN TO REN STEFF CURRY AND JAMES HARDON A AND THE WARRIORS THE MOST FAMOUS TEAM EVER WALK ON THE COURT ARE THE CHIEF CULPRITS EXHIBITAY IN BAD BEHAVIOR TOWARDS REFTS SO YOUV GOT THIS WEIRD COMBINATION YEH NOT AS FASCINATING YE A I STILL REMEMBER BEING A LAKERS FAN YOU HAVE THE GREAT MAGIC JOHNSANTEAMS AND WATCHING LARY BIRD DO HIS NINE STAP LAY AP AND I'MO COME OT MAKE THE CALL YOU AFOR MOST PLAYERS OF HIS ERA THAT WOULD HAVE COUNTED HIS TRAVELLING BHE GLARRY BIRD WAS LIKE LEBRAN THE NEW MERCADES OF HIS DAY HE PLAYED WITH CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW THEY APPLIED TO HIM THE INEQUALITY ON A BASKETBALL COURT IT'S MORFOUT IT'S PROFOUND IT IT'S MORE PROFOUND THAT WASN'T LAURY BIRDS ERA YI GOT LARRY BIRD WAS A MILLIONAIRE LEBRADJINES MIGHT BE A BILLIONAREYE AND A THESE GUIES ARE GLOBAL FRANCHIZE YE SO YOUV GOT IN A FUNNY WAY A MICROCOSM IT CAN NOD MICROCOSM ON A BASKETBALL CORD WAT'S GOING ON THE LARGES SOCIETY THE ENVIE IS SET OUT TO REFT THE GAMES MORE OBJECTIVELY MORE ACCURATELY MORE FAIRILY THIS IS ENRAGED THE STARS IN THEIR FANS AND COACHES YOU WANTED A WHI HERE'S WHAT I THINK THE STAR IS USED TO GET MORE CALLS IN THEIR FAVOR THAN THEY DO NOW JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE STARS OBJECTIVE REFTS HAVE ELIMINATED SOME OF THEIR PRIVILEGE THE MORE OBJECTIVITY THERE IS THE LESS POWER THEY HAVE AND TO THEM THAT'S OUTRAGES I THINK AMERICAN LIFE JUST NOW HAS AT LEAST ONE THING IN COMMON WITH BASKET BALL THE AUTHORITY OF ITS REFERES IS UNDER ATTACK IF PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THE REFTS ONE DAY YOU WMAKE UP IN A WORLD THAT SEEMES NOT JUST UNFAIR BUT ACTUALLY SORT OF RINKED THAT IS IT'S INCAPABLE OF BECOMING FAIR BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE UNFAIRNESS HAVE THE POWER TO PRESERVE IT BOON DO YOU YOU FLIP THE SWITCHIIN A HUNDRED AND TEN SCRANS GO DARK I'M ALL THE LALL SMALL STREEG DI YOU MANUALY BIES WE GE WE REM MOST NIGHTS JO BORD OST STAYS AT THE REPLACE SENTERE UNTIL ALMOST TWO IN THE MORNING JUST HIM IN A COUPLE OF GRAPHS

PEOPLE ON TOP THE ELEAS THINK THEIR SPECIAL THEY BEHAVE AS PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY THINK THEIR SPECIAL YOUNG PEOPLE EMULATE THEM WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT THEY JUST ASSUME THAT'S HOW YOU ACT IF YOU

ABOUT THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION THAT'S IN A MINUTE FROM CHICAGOBOBO GRADIO WENT OUR PROGRAMME CONTINUES TIS MARI COM LI FROM MOR GLASS TO DAY'S PROGRAMME NO FAIR STAYES ABOUT PEOPLE YOUNG AND OLD OLIVER OUR COUNTRY FEELING A SENSE OF INJUSTICE FEELING WRONGED AND NOT GETTING SATISFACTION FROM THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE WE HAV ARRIVED ODAT TO OUR PROGRAMME AT TWO THE FAIRER SECT  FOR THIS ACT THAT'S GO TO BROADWAY TO SHOW IT NOW THAT STRETCH WITH THIS TRUE STORY I WHEN I  FIFTEEN EARS ALL Y WOUL TRAVEL THE CONTRY GIVING FEETS OS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION AN AMERICAN LEADS AN HALLS FOR PRIZE MONEY THE TO THI WI THE STE MEAN BNT O BY MY MAL THEL ME PAY FOR COLLEGE I I WOULD TRAVEL TO BIG TITES BI TAN ER AN NOT FRAS AN AL I I WOULD GIVIS PEETS WHEN A HOLL I O MONEY AN MEN BRI BO TO BUT MY MITTLE FI TO THE POSIT BOT FOR LATER THIS IS HIDY SHRACK AND T SHOW WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME I RUVE THIS SHELL IT'S TOTALLY ORIGINAL IN WHAT IT'S ABOUT IN AND HOW I TELLUS ITS STORY ITS RY FUNNY IT'S A VERY PATRIOTIC SHOW IN THIS TOTALLY UNCORNY WAY IN THE SHOW A HIGTYSTRECK RECREATES THE IDEALISTIC SPEECH THAT YHOU GAVE AT FIFTEEN THAT WONER AND NOF MONEY TO PAY FOR HER WHOLE COLLEGE EDUCATION AD THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION AND ABOUT HER OWN LIFE OUR SHOW TO DAY IS ABOUT FAIRNESS AND A HIDYSRAK TO BE CLEER SAYS THAT HOR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SELF DEFINITELY SAW THE CONSTITUTION AS A POWERFUL INSTRUMENT IN FORCING FAIRNESS I BELIEVED IT MADE OUR CONTRY FAIRER MORE EQUAL MORE DEMOCRATIC I BELIEVE THAT WHOLEHEARTEDLY AT FIFTEEN AT FIFTEEN YOU SAID YOU SAID THAT IS A KID YOU HAD A CRUSH ON THE CONSTITUTION YES WHAT IS THAT MEAN I IS REALLY EXCITED BY IT LIKE I I WAS A FERY IDEALISTIC AM NURTY YOUNG PERSON AND RESEARCHING AND READING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION MY DOUBT IS THE HISTORY TEACHER AND TALKD VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE GENIUS OF THIS DOCUMENT AND IT'S ABILITY TO OF ALVE AND AND TO SOMEHOW SURPASS AND A RECTIFY THE UN THE FLAWS OF ITS FOUNDERS LIKE THIS IDEA THAT THERE WAS A DOCUMENT THAT COULD BE CREATED BY FLOD PEOPL THE COULD BE BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT WHEN YOU SAID THA I REMINDED THIS OF THIS FAMOUS COT FROM BIL CLENWERE HE SAID AND IF ITHING IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL QUOTE TO WE SAID THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA THAT WHAT'S RIGHT WITH AMERICA CAN'T FIX YES I MEAN FREDERIC DOUGLAS HAS THE SIMILAR QUOTE WHICH IS THAT LIKE YES THE CONSTITUTION WAS FOUNDED ON THE CREAT EVIL COMPROMISE OF SLAVERY BUT THAT IT ALSO CONTAIND THE MEANS BY WHICH WE COULD RECTIFY THAT EVIL AND SO INSTO YOUR PLAY IS IS PARTLY ABOUT THAT HOPEFUL FEELING THAT YOU HAD ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION WHEN YOU WERE A KID YES BUT ALSO HOW YOU CAME TO SEE IT LIKE WHEN YOU BECAME AN ADULT AS A DEEPLY FLOD DOCUMENT AM YOU TALK IN THE PLAY ABOUT HOW ESPECIALLY THE CONSTITUTION AND AMERICAN LAW REALLY DID NOT ADDRESS THINGS THAT EFFECT YOU AND MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY S ES WOMEN IN YOUR FAMILY YASD A LONG TIME AND WHEN IT DID FINALLY GET AROUND TO ADDRESSING A WOMEN IT WAS LAIT AND IT CAME TO IT KIND OF KIND OF ACREAKALY N VERCRYALY LARGE SECTION OFTHE PLAY WE  TALK ABUT HOW HOW TO GET WOMEN TO BE COVERED BY THE CONSTITUTION WAWYERS IN THE JUSTICES HAD A KIND OF JURYRIG WOMEN IN TO HAVING RIGHTS USING FOR TEMPLE THE NINTH AMENMEN COMAT YEU JOU JUST EXPLAIN WHAT THE NINTH AMENMENT DOES SURE SURE SO THE NINTH AMENDMENTS WHICH WAS MY FAVORITE AS A KID SAYS A THE ENUMERATION IN THE CONSTITUTION OF CERTAIN RIGHTS SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO DENY OR DISPAIRAGE OTHER RIGHTS I JUST TE I FOR READYOUN YSANG YOU ARE JUST FOR SETTING THAT FRIM RYO RESIDING FROM MEMORIAAAT A WHA TECNICALLY SHALL NOT BE CONSORED TO DENY OR DISPARAGE OTHERS RETAINED BY THE PEOPLE MEANING THAT JUST BECAUS A CERTAIN RIGHT IS NOT UN EXPLICITLY GIVEN TO YOU IN THE CONSTITUTION I DOESN'T MEAN IYOU DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT THIS AMENDMENT ALOWS FOR THE FACT THAT THE FOUNDERS COUL NOT HAVE IMAGINED THE FUTURE THAT WERE LIVING IN NOW WEN'S LIKE THE ADMITTING IT ITS THING EVERY POSSIBLE THING IN THIS ONE DOC YOU RIGHT I ALSO LIKE TO THINK THAT IN THREE HUNDRED YEARS THEY KNEW THAT THE WORLD WOULD LOOK VERY DIFFERENT AND IND IN THE PLAY THOUGH YOU SAY TACTUALLY LI GET THIS THING TO A PLY TO WOMEN JUST AS WILLIAM O DOUGLAS HAS TO COME UP WITH THE CONCEPT WHICH IS SO STRANGE AND SO PROMISED POETIC LIKE THIS IDEA OF THE PANUMBRA RIGHT WHAT HIS UPO NUMBER HERE I AM STANDING IN TELIFE AND THERE YOU ARE SITTING IN THE DARKE AND A THIS SPACE BETWEEN US THIS SPACE RIGH HERE PARTIAL ILLUMINATION THE SHADOWY SPACE FATE HERE THIS IS O PANUMBA WILLIAM A DUGLAS ILO TAT HIS CHENOERA MAT OFOREIGN SAID THAT YOU COULD THEREFORE TTINK IT TU THIS IDEA THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE SHADOWS OF THE CONSTITUTION WE ARE IN THE EKINDO IN BETWEEN SHADOWY SPACE ARE OUR RIGHTS WE HAVE NOT YET NAMED YOU COULD USE THE NINT AMENDMENT TO ESSENTIALLY LIKE SHINE A LITTLE LIGHT INTO THE DARK CORNERS AND SAY OCAME OVER THERE AND THEN IS YOU SAND TO SHOW THE NINT AMENDMENT COMBISED WITH THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT IN A KIND OF LIKE WONDER TOIN HOWASCIVATIAN MUMMAR YES TO DECIDE RAVERSES WAY BUT AS BUT THE NINTOMEMEN IS ALSO OF THE WAY THE BIRTH CONTROL GETS LEGALIZED IN THE SIXTIES AND UM AND WAS HEAR WHEN HEARE AN ANDOS NOW FROM THE PLAY CAN AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THAT CAME ABOUT AND IT BEGINS WITH YOU EXPLAINING HOW YOU AN A FRIEND GODS BIRTH CONTROL

A TOU RESWELL GOT HERSELF ARRESTED FOR DESPENSING I UDEES TO POOR WOMEN AT HER CONNECTICUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD SHE FACE THE YEAR IN PRISON TALK HER CASE ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT AND THIS THIS IS ACTUALLY WHEN WILLIAM O DOUGLAS FIRST PULLED OUT HIS BIG PONUMBER METAPHOR THIS IS MONEY SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT ONE THING THE CONSTITUTION SURELY GUARANTES IS THE RIGHT TO FRIVACE AND THAT THIS ALOWS A WOMEN TO PUT IN AN I UDEE AS LONG AS SHE IS MARRIED AND AS LONG AS HER HUSBAND SAYS THAT IT IS OGAY THIS LA VERY SCARYG MOMENT FOR WILLIAM O DOUGLAS BECAUSE IM NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THE NIGHT AMENDMENT NOBODY EX SEP FOR ME AT FIFTEEN JUS IS GILLY US SAID HEDENNG A REMEMBER STUDYING IT IN LAW SCHOOL BUT THEY HAD TO DIG UP THIS AMENDMENT THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS BECAUSE HERE WAS JUST NO OTHER WAY TO DE WITH THE FEMALE BODY BECAUSE THEYL WANTED TO MAKE BIRTH CONTROL EGL THEY DID THEY WANTED IT BECAS WELL BECAUS I FOUND OUT THAT WILLIAM O DOUGLAS WHO IS MY HERO WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN JUST

WINNER PROPY A BEST KNOWN FOR ANGELS IN AMERICA AND IN THIS INTERVIEW THEY HAVE THIS INTERESTING EXCHANGE A CRISHONER SAYS TO HER THAT HE THOUGHT THAT HER SHOW WAS PARTLY ABOUT THIS THING THAT HE HASS BEEN A WRITING ABOUT IN THINKING ABOUT EVER SINCE HEU WROTE THAT A MOVY ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN A FEW YEARS AGO THAT STEPHEN SPELLBURG DIRECTED CRISHINER SAID A THAT IN HIS VIEW E CENTRAL QUESTION OF DEMOCRACY IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF MYSTICAL BOND HOLDING EVERYBODY TOGETHER LINCOLN TALKED ABOUT THE MYSTIC CORDS OF MEMORY AND VERY CONSCIOUSLY TRIED TO PULL EVERYBODY TOGETHER INTO ALLEGIANCE FOR THE UNION BUT CRISHIONER SAID THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY INTERROGATE WHAT THE THING IS THAT IS ACTUALLY PULLING US TOGETHER IT'S REALLY DOING JUST A STACK OF PAPER WRIGHT IS JUST AN ACT OF FAITH THAT WE HAVE WITH EACH OTHER AND HE POINTED OUT THAT HOW OF COURSE EVERYBODY KNOWS WRIHT NOW THIS ACT OF FAITH THIS FEELING THAT WE ARE ALL ON THIS TOGETHER AND WE ARE ONE PEOPLE WHO CAN WORKTHINGS OUT TOGETHER THAT IS IN SUCH SHORT SUPPLY AND THE VERY IDEA OF TEAN AGORS GIVING SPEECHES ABOUT THAT STACK OF PAPERS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION AND IT'S IMPORTANCE AND ITS VALUES CRISHONER SAID I'M A QOTING HERE IS FEELS LIKE AN ETHOSE OF A NOT VERY DISTANT AND YET SOMEHOW VERY DISTANT PAST WERE PEOPLE BELIEVED IN FAIRNESS THAT THE SUPERSTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE ALL SWON ALLEGIANCE TO O THE

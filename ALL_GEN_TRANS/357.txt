WELCOME TO THE HUBORMAN LAPON A N AS SCIENCE  SCIENCE PACE  TOENC RLI I MANDUR HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AN OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WE ARE NOW LIVE TO DAY WITH OUR ANNUAL AND LIFETIME MEMBERS OF THE HUBERAN LABPODCAST PREMIUM CHANNEL FIRST OFF I JUST WON A WELCOME EVERYONE THANK SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE I HOPE YOU'RE HVING A GOOD HOLIDAYS AND ALE WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR AT THIS POINT AND AGAIN AT THE END I WANT A KICK OFF OUR DISCUSSION TO DAY BY JUST HIGH LIGHTING SOME OF TE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT YOU ALL HAVE ALREADY DONE THE PREMIUM CHANNEL AS MOST OF YOU PRESUME WY KNOW PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR IMPORTANT RESEARCH AND WHEN I SAY IMPORTANT RESEARCH WE CAN DEFINE THAT AS RESEARCH THAT IS DONE ON HUMANS WITH HUMANS WITH THEIR CONSENT OF COURSE THAT WE BELIEVE STANDS THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF LEADING TO NOU QUALITY TREATMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE SO SUPPORT FROM THE PREMIM CHANNEL THAT IS FROM YOU HAS ALREADY ALLOWED US TO MAKE SEVERAL SUBSTANTIAL GIFTS TO VERIOUS LABORATORIES AS WELL AS SOME OTHER ON SOME OTHER ENDEAVOR SO I'LL JUST QUICKLY TELL YOU WHERE THOSE FUNDS HAVE GONE AND THEY'LL TL YOU SOMETHING REALLY TRULY EXCITING ABOUT WHERE WERE HEADED AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WE'LL GET TO THE QUESTIONS IN A MOMENT BUT I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT TO HEAR FIRST OF ALL WE MADE A U A YOUR LONG GIFT AND WHEN I SAY YOURE LONG GIFT AT WERE TUGGING GIFTS THAT I CERTAINLY CAN SAY FOR MY PERSPECTIVE AS A RESEARCH OR WHOSE RUN A LABORATORY FOR A VERY LONG TIME THESE ARE THE SIZE GIFTS THAT ALLOW RESEARCHES TO DO RESEARCH THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THEY PAY SALARIES THEY PAY FOR MATERIALS IN THE LABORATORY THEY PAY FOR THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ALLOW SCIENCE TO HAPPEN THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAPPEN WE MADE A GIFT O DOCTOR ALEA CRUMS LABORATORY AT STAMFORD IN THE DEPARTMENT F PSYCHOLOGY SHE STUDIES MIND SET SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE EPISODE WITH ALLEY AS SHE'S CALLED AM DOCTOR CRUM ON THE HUBRAN LAPODCAST SHE STUDDING MIND SETS AN HOW THEY EFFECT BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND THAT WORK HOPEFULLY WILLGET A REPORT BACK ON AT SOME POINT SOON ABOUT HOW THOSE MIND SETS CAN IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL WORK ATHLETICS AND OTHER AIRS OF LIFE SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT YOU SUPPORTED THAT WORK THROUGH THE PREMIUM CHANNEL AND THEN THAT WORK CAN HAPPEN AND THEN WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THAT WORK ARE OUT INTO THE GENERAL POPULATION MEANING INTO THE PUBLIC SO THAT PEOPLEL CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT KNOWLEDGE RIGHT AWAY AND IN MANY CASES IMPLEMENT THAT KNOWLEDGE WE ALSO MADE A GIFT TO DOCTOR SCOTCHION PANNDAT THE SALT CONSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES SUCH AND PANDA IS IN EXPERT IN CIRCADIAN BIOLOGY AND INTERMITTAN FASTING AND THE STUDY HE IS USING THOSE FUNS FOR RELATES TO INTERMITTAN FASTING AS A SPECIFIC TOOL FOR IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH WE ALSO MADE GIFT TO DOCTOR CARLESHATS IN AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SHE STUDYING HOW THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND MATERNAL CONDITIONS AND IN ESPECIALLY INFECTIONS OR A VERIOUS KINDS THAT AM PREGNANT WOMEN SOMETIMES ENCOUNTER OR GET CAN AFFECT THE DEVELOPING FEEDAL BRAIN AND THAT WORK ALSO RELATES TO STEMSELVS I KNOWTHERS A LOT OF EXCITEMEN ABOUT STEMSELVES NOWADAYS I'LL GIVE YOU NOP DATE ON THAT AS SOON AS I CAN WE ALSO MADE A SUBSTANTIAL GIFT O DOCTOR JOANNA STYN GLASS AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DOCTOR STYN GLASS HAS NOT YET BEEN ON THE PODCAS BUFLEECO WE'LL HAVE TIME TO COME ON THE PODCAS AT SOME POINT SOON A SHE STUDYNG AND DEVELOPING NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR EATING DISORDERS  IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE EPISODE ON HEALTHY IN DISORDERED EATING AMSADLY A ANTERECTIA NAROSA IS THE MOST DEADLY OF ALL THE PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS THAT IS A GREAT NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT HAVE ANTERECTIO NEROSA UNFORTUNATELY GO ON TO DIE A A MAL NOURISHMENT IN THINGS RELAIED TO MAL NOURISHMENT SO IT'S IT CRITICAL CRITICAL ISSUE THAT'S NOT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH AND FRANKLY IS NOT AM WELL FUNDED ENOUGH AT THE LEVEL OF FEDERAL FUNDING BUT AM THROUGH YOUR SUPPORT THERE'S NOW FUNDING AM SIPHENING INTO HER LABORATORY AND SHE'S DIRECTING THOSE FUNS DIRECTLY AT NOVEL TREATMENTS BASED ON NEROF SCIENCE AND HABIT FORMATION FOR EATING DISORDERS ANERECTIA AND OTHERS BEING DISORDERS DOCTOR NOLIAM WILLIAMS ALSO AT STAMFORD WHO DOES WORK ON TRANSCRINIAL MAGNET STIMULATION WHICH THE TOOL TO NON AN BASILY ALTER NERAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN A FOR PURPOSES OF RELIEVING DEPRESSION AND P T ST AND EXCITINGLY DOCTOR WILLIAMS LABORATORY ALSO COMBINES T AMAS TRANS CRIRNO MANIT STIMULATION WITH PSYCHODELIC TREATMENTS A IN PARTICULAR IBEGAIN BUT ALSO SILICIVAN NOTHERS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THAT AND THEN LASBUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST A WE ALSO FUNDED A CHRONOBIOLOGY CONFERENCE THEY WERE AM DESPERATE FOR FUNDS A REACHED OUT AND WE WERE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE THE FUNDS FOR THAT A CONFERENCE THOSE FUNDS ALOUD GRADUATE STUDENTS AND POSTOCS WHO COME FROM LABORATORIES THAT COULDN'T AFFORD TO SEND THOSE STUDENTS IN POSTOCKS THAT CONFERENCE TO ATTEND THAT CONFERENCE AND I MUST SAY FROM A LOT OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNI THE ABILITY TO ATTEND THESE HIGH QUALITY MEETINGS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THOSE YOUNG SCIENTISTS TO BE ABLE TO GLEAN INPORTANT INFORMATION AND GO BACK TO THEIR OWN LABORATORIES AND TO MAKE NOVEL CONTRIBUTIONS ALSO CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NEW COLLABORATION GING SPARKED UP OR NOT AND A I SHOULD IST MENTION THAT THAT THE RESERCH LABORATORIES THT WE FUND WERE AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE CONFERENCES BUT THE CONFERNCES I THINK ARE ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT AM WAY TO DIRECT FUNDS OCTOR THOSE YE DONO CHRONOBIOLOGY IS HOW THE TIMING OF LIGHT TEMPERATURE AND EXERCISE AND EATING AFFECT HEALTH S ALL THINGS THAT I THINK A PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN SO A THAT'S IT FOR WHAT WE COVERED AM AND WHAT WE SUPPORTED IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AR VERY PROUD OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ROVIDE THANKS TO YOUR HELP AND I AM VERY VERY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WHILE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT WAS SICOM US THE HUVRON LAPODCAS THROUGH YOUR PREMIUN A CHANNEL SUPPORT THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE THAT SUPPORT AND WE HAD A MATCHING DONATION DOLLAR FOR DOLAR DONATION FROM THE TINY FOUNDATION HEADING INTO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TINY FOUNDATION IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO A DOLLAR DOLLAR A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCCUSE ME WHICH IS EXCITING AND WE'VE BROUGHT ON IN ADDITION TO THAT TO OTHER DONERS WHO ARE GOING TO ALSO DO DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR DONATION SO ANOTHER WORDS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE HURM LAB PREMIUM CHANNEL HAS OR RAISES IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THERE WILL BE THREE DOLLARS TO MATCH THAT SO THIS IS PHENOMENAL AND WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE SI COMMON HUBRAN LAPODCAS ARE NOW DOING ON WHAT'S CONSIDERED ON UNIVERSY CAMSES AS MAJOR PHILANTHROPY SO VERY EXCITING AM AND SO THANK YOU OWE SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT YOU ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE RESEARCH AND I DON'T JUT SAY THAT I KNOW ANY TIME THERE'S FUNDER RAIZORS THINGS THAT SORT BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT A FUND RAZOR THIS US THAING SAING THANK YOU TO YOU BUT IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO KNOW WHERE THOS FUNDS GO AND AM WE MAKE SURE THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF VERY STREME LINE WE CUT THE FAT ON THE ON IN EVERY DIMENSION SO THAT M THE MONEY CAN GO TO DISCOVERY NEW TOOLS FOR MENTAL HALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH IN PERFORMANCE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH OKET FIRST QUESTION IS UP CAROLINE A WRITES I AM INTERESTIN STUDIES ABOUT THE INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX OH YES SUCH AN INTERESTING STRUCTURE WEL YOU PLEASE SHARE ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THOSE THANK YOU OR ALL YOU DO IN THE ADVANCEMENTS IDE THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE CAROLINE AND OTHERS LISTENING O CASE TO THE ENTERMIDSING QUARTEX FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT A MAY NOT HAVE SEEN THE EPISODE ON WILL POWER AND TENACITY BUT EVEN IF YOU HAVE IS A REGION OF THE BRAIN THAT IS INVOLVED IN LEANING IN TO DIFFICULT CHALLENGES OF ALL KINDS THIS IS AN AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT GETS LARGER WHEN WE EMBRACE EFFORT THAT LEADS TO A BIT OF INTERNAL ANXIETY BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR US AN ADAPTIVE THING AND THIS IS AN AIREA OF THE BRAIN THAT GETS SMALLER WHEN WE DON'T ENGAGE IN CHALLENGING ENDEAVORS NOW WE NEED TO TO FINE CHALLENGING ENDEAVORS VERY SPECIFICALLY CHALLENGING ENDEAVORS THAT STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF THE INTERAMID SINGLIT QUARTEXS ARE CHALLENGING ENDEAVORS THAT WE WOULD PREFER NOT TO DO WE MAY WANT THE ENGOLL WRITES WE MAY WANT THE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXERCISE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE LEARNING THE CONSEQUENCE OF WHATEVER THE CHALLENGE IS BUT THAT THE CHALLEGE ITSELF FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE AND HERE OF QOURSE WE WANTIT TO BE A UNCOMFORTABLE BUT SAFE CHALLENGES IS WHAT IS WHAT SGUN AGROW THE INTER MIDSINGULAT QUARTEX NOW ANOTHER THING BUT THE INTERMIDSINGLI QUARTEX ATS IMPORTANT IS THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT END AT BEING SUCCESSFUL DIETOR SUCCESSFUL A PURSUIT OF FITNESS FOR PEOPLE THAT AM COMPLETE A DEGREE OR FINISH AN EXAM OR THINGS THAT SORT THE INTERMIDSINGLI QUARTEX  BIGGER FOR PEOPLE THAT FAIL TO DO THE WORK REQUIRED TO PREPARE SO THE PREPARATION THAT IS AH THE INTERAMISINGLA QUARTEX ACTUALLY SHOWS A BIT OF ATROPHY SO THAT INTERMIDSINGLIT QUARTEX IS AN ANATOMICAL AND NURRL REFLECTION OF WILL POWER AND TENACITY AND I THINK WHAT PEOPLE GET WRONG OVER AND OVER ABOUT THE SORTS OF FINDINGS IS THAT THE INTERMIDSINGULA QUARTEX IS REALLY RESPONDING TO A VARIETY OF IMPUTS AS A LOT OF DIFFERENT AND PUTS AN OUT PUTS WE KNOW THAT BASE ON NERAL CIRCUIT TRACING BUT IT ABSOLUTELY RESPONDS BEST TO THINGS THAT FEEL LIKE THAT THEY ARE INDEED DIFFICULT THAT THEY ARE A CHALLENGE SO IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU ENJOY CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE AND ITS JUST PURE BLISS FOR YOU THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH THAT'S NOT GOING TO GROW YOUR INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX HOWEVER IF YOU AD OF IT OF LET'S SAY A HIGHER INTENSITY WORK I LIKE DOING A LONG RUN OR HEIGHT ON SUNDAYS I DON'T DO SPRINTS TOO OFTEN AT THE END OF THAT AH BUT IF I WERE TO DO COUPLE HILLSPRINTS AT THE END AND I REALY THIS THIS IS ROUGH THIS SOCKS THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SORT OF THING THAT'S CAN A STIMULATE THE INTERMIDSINGULATE QUARTEX THE NTERMID SINGULATE QUARTEXINCE CAROLIN YOU ASKED ABOUT STUDIES WAS ACTUALLY A DISCOVERED IN CASES WHERE PEOPLE WERE STIMULATING THIS BRAN AREA AND THE SUBJECTS THESE WERE PEOPLWERE SEEVING THEIR A SURGERY FOR OTHER REASONS REPORTED FEELING LIKE SOMETHING WAS IMPENDING SOME NOT IMPENDING DOOM BUT THERE WAS SOME CHALLENGE LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO HEAD INTO A STORM SOMETHING CHALLENGING WAS COMING BUT THE OTHER SUBJECTIVE FEELING THAT THEY REQORTED WAS FEELN LIKE THEY COULD LEAN INTO IT LIKE THEYRE READY FOR THEYRE READY TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE SO WAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU ARE INTERESTED IN GROWING YOUR INTERMID SINGULA QUARTEX I'LL TELL YOU WHY THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO IS YOU LOOK IN FOR THAT FEELING OF LEANING INTO CHALLENGE THAT FRICTION IF SOMETHING'S TOO EASY OR ITS TOO DELIGHTFUL THAT'S NOT CIN A CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR INTERMID SINGULATE QUARTEX A FUNCTION AND GROWTH I MIGHT CONTRIBUTE OTHER THINGS INDEED IT WILL AM AND LIFE ISN'T ALL ABOUT LEANING INTO CHALLENGE BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO STIMULATE YOUR INTERMID SINGULATE QUARTEX IN THIS WAY AND BY WAY THOSE CHALLENGES CAN COME FROM PHYSICAL ENDEAVORS AND COME FROM LANGUAGE LEARNING IT COME FROM HARD CONVERSATION THAT YOUR ON TYOU BEEN PUTTING OFF THAT'S HARD FOR YOU TO HAVE LORD KNOWS WE ALL I'LL HAVE THOSE ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES OF TINGS THAT WERE PUTTING OFF R THAT ARE HARD FOR US OR THAT FEEL DIFFICULT AGAIN KEEP THESE ENDEAVOR SAFE NEVER ONE TO DO ANYTHNGTHT WOULD DAMAGE YOUR MENTAL HALTH OR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT LEANING INTO CHALLENGE IN THAT WAY DOES SEEM TO ACTIVATE AND GROW THE INTERMID SINGULATE QUARTEX NOW THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IS THAT THERE ARE STUDIES EXCUSE ME SHOWING THAT THE SO CALLED SUPER AGERS UM THEY SUPER AGERS I DON'T LIKE THAT NAME SO MUCH AS SHOULD ITS A BIT OF A MISNOMER THEY CALL THEM SUPERAGERS BUT THEY REALLY SHOULD  BE CALLED SUPERNON AGERS BECAUS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY COGNIV FUNCTION MUCH LONGER THAN MOST INDIVIDUALS THEIR MEMORY THER I CUE IS REMAIN STABLE INTO THEIR MUCH MUCH LATER DECADES OF THEIR LIFE OR EVEN IMPROVES OVER TIME AND THEN THE CORRELATION AND GAN THESSIS CORRELATION BUT THESE ARE THESE PEOPLE'S INTERAMID SINGULAT QUARTEX DOES NOT ATROPHY AND IN GENERAL WHAT THE STUDIES POINT YOU IN THERE STILL NEEDS TO BE MORE DATA COLLECTED ON THIS IS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE REGULARLY ENGAGING IN THINGS THAT ARE HARD FOR THEM AND CHALLENGING AND THEY'VE EMBRACE THAT CHALLENGE SO LOS TO SAY IT ABOUT INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX AH BUT I THINK I THAT GRABS THE TOP CONTOUR AND AM I'M A BIG FAN OF TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFICULT AT LEAST ONE THING AIDEALLY EVERY WEEK AM AND PERHAPS EVEN EVERY DAY A LITTLE BIT IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH A MAYBE EN JUST FIVE MINUTES IT'S THAT FRICTION THAT FEELING H I DON'T ONLY DO THIS I CAN'T DO THIS AND THEN CONTINUING TO PRACTICE ARE CONTINUING TO LEAN INTO THAT CHALLENGE SAFELY OF COURSE A THAT IS GOING TO GROW THAT INTERAMID SIGNALLIT CORTECS AND I JUST THINK THAT'S AMAZING RIGHT WE ARE SO MUCH ABOUT BRAINAA ATROPHY AND MEMORY LOSS AND ET CETERA ET CETERAAS WE GET OLDER LOT OF DATA NOW ABOUT HW TIPERS ORVE HEALTH HEALTHY PHYSICAL FUNCTION HERE WEE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HOW TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY COGNAVE FUNCTION AND THE INTERMID SEENGLIT QORTEX SEEMS TO BE A BAROMETER OF HOW WELL WE ARE DOING THAT MARK S ASK WE LOVE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT AN EVENING ROUTINE AND NOT JUST MORNING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO LIGHT I LOVFE THIS QUESTION LOGH THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I'VE MADE A LOT OF CHANGES IN THE LAST YEAR RELATED TO THIS BECAUSE UM OUKNOW THERE'S THISGUY ON THE INNER NET THAT TALKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING MORNING SUNLIGHT I'M JUST GETTING UM THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US BUT UM AN GALS BUT UM I SUPPOSE I'VE BEEN QUITE VOCAL ABOUT THE IMPORTS OF GETTING MORNING SUNLIGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER WAKING AND OF COURSE OF COURSE OF COURSE UNLES YOU HAVE POWERS I'M NOT AWARE OF IF YOU WAKE UP BEFORE THE SUN COMES OUT OUBAOIYS ASKD WHAT DO I DO YOU WAIT TILL THE SUN COMES OUT IF IT'S OVERCAST YOU GET OUTSIDE A BIT LONGER IF YOU WANT A WAKE UP BEFORE THE SUN COMES OUT TURN ON BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS O THESE DAYS OF OUT SHEUVE BEEN PLAYING AROUND LO IT WITH SOME BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS I'M BEFORE I BECAUSE I TEND TO WAKE UP BEFORE THE SUN IS OUT 'S THE WINTER MONTHS BUT IN ANY CASE IOVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE MORNING ROUTINE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY AND A BIT ABOUT THE AFTERNOON A PART OF THE DAY EVENING ROUTINE OO KAT WELI'LL TELL YOU IDEAL AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DO UM I'M ALWAYS SHOOTING FOR IDEAL BUT I'M HUMAN I THINK THERE'S THIS IDEA ON THE INTERNET AM THAT I'VE SEEN THAT YOU MY WHOLE LIFE AS IS PROTOCOLS PROTOCAL PROTOCAL PROTOCAL AND INDEED SOMETIMES IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IN INDEED SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T I'M HUMAN THINGS HAPPEN UM WE ALL ENCOUNTER DIFFERENT CHALLENGES SO CHANCE YOUR CRUST A QUESTION DIRECTLY MAR I THINK IT'S I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IF POSSIBLE THAT YOU GET IT WE'LL SPLASH O SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES IN THE AFTERNOON IN EVENING WHY WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT AND WHAT WER REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS NOT NECESSARILY SEEING HE SUNSET OF THE BEACH AL THOUGH I'LL BE GREAT IF YOU COULD DO THAT BE GETTING SOME SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN MAYBE FOR FIVE TEN MINUTES IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE MORNING SUNLIGHT BUT IT DOES HAVE A GREAT BENEFIT AND THE BENEFIT IS IT A JUST THE SENSITIVITY OF THE NURONS IN YOUR RETINAND IN YOUR BRAIN SUCH THAT IT PROTECTS YOU AGAINST BRIGHTER ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS LATER IN THE EVENING NOW DOESN'T PROTECT YOU COMPLETELY BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IF NORMALLY AND THIS IS TRUE BRIGHT LIGHT VIEWED FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS OR MORE BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FOR I M I'M TONING ABOUT SOMEBODY ON A STANDARDSCEDUAL NOT SHIFT WORKER BRIGHT LIGHTS VIEWED FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS OR MORE BETWEEN THEHOURS OF TEN P M AND FOR I M CAN DROMADICALLY QUASH MELLATONE AND LEVELS MELETONE OF BEING THE HORMO THAT INVOLVED IN FEELING SLEEPY IN FALLING A SLEEP IT DOES OTHER THINGS AS WELL OF COURSE IT SECREVED FROM THE PINEAL WE KNOW BASED N A REALLY NIE STUDY PUBLISHAN SIENCE REPORTS THAT IF YOU VIEW THAT AFTERNOON LATE AFTERNOON EVENING SUNLIGHT DON'T TO BE TOO STRICT ABOUT THE TIME YET YOUNG POPU SUN GLASSES OFF AS LONGAS YOU CAN DO THAT SAFELYU GET SOME SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES OR IF YOU CAN'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN AND BY THE WAY NEVER STARE DIRECTLY AT THE SUN AT LEAST GETTING SOME DAY LIGHT IN YOUR EYES BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN THAT CAN OFFSET THAT MELOTONE AN REDUCTION BY ABOUT FIFTY FIVE ZERO PERCENT WHICH IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE NOW YOU WOULD STILL DO WELL TO DIM THE LIGHTS IN THE EVENING AND ONE THING THAT I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH RECENTLY IS A USING RED LIGHTS SO AM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR RED LIGHTS I THINK OH YOUR TALKING ABOUT YOU' RED LIGHT PANEL WHICH THAT HAS ITS USE IS THOSE TEN TO BE VERY BRIGHT RED LIGHTS OR A IN A PORTABLE RED LIGHT I ASHA USE A SMALL PORTABLE RED LIGHT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF THICK PIECE OF TOAST A I USE THAT FOR OTHER REASONS THIS IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TIME OUT WITH EVENING REUTINE WITH EVENING ROUTINE IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL AND VERY VERY COST EFFECTIVE TO GET SOME RED BULBS AND PUT THEM INSAY THE BEDROOM WHERE YOU READ BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP OR IN A PARTICULAR ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE YOU TEND TO SPEND TIME AND IN THE EVENING MAKES FOR R NIGHTS MELLOW FEEL BUT AT ALSO DOES SEVERAL OTHER THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT IF THERARE THE CORRECT RED BULBS ANDI'LL MENTION THE ONCE THAT I'VE BEEN USING IN A MOMENT THEY AELIMINATE ALL THE BLUE WAVE LANGTS THAT TEND TO BE STIMULATING FOR THEY WELL WE ALL THE NORAGENERGIC SYSTEM SO A DRENDALLIND NORA DRENDLIND CARTERS ALL ET CETERA INDEED THERE'S A STUDY SHOWS THAT WHEN SHIFT WORKERS WHO HALVE TO BE UP AT NIGHT YUSE RED LIGHTS OF THE TIPE THI'M DESCRIBING WHEN THEY WORK UNDER RED LIGHT THEY HAVE LEST OF A QUORTIS ALL INCREASE THAN WHERE THEY TO WORK UNDERSTANDARD FLORESCENT LIGHTS OR EVEN STANDARD ELLY D LIGHTS SO NOMBER ONE THING WOULD BE DIM THE LIGHTS IN THE EVENING IN AT NIGHT AS MUCH AS YOU SAFELY CAN TO PERFORM WHATEVER FUNCTIONSNG YOU DON'T FALL YOU OW DONT BURN YOURSELF OF THE STOIAN IF YOU HAVE TO WRITE AND DO WORK AS I OFTEN DO YOU NEED LIGHT A BUT TO THE EXTEND HEYOU CAN SHIFT TO RED LIGHTS A THAT CAN BE HELPFUL AND MANY PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE AN MYSELF INCLUDEOD FINE THAT YOU GET SLEEPIER WHEN YOU DO THAT S I MIGHT JUST DO THIS FOR THE LAST HOUR OF THE EVENING EVEN IF I'M UP TILL TEN OR ELEVEN OR IF I DO IT EARLIER THAN I TEN TO GET REALLY SLEEPY BUT THOSE RED LIGHTS U YOU KNOW I BUTA BELAMP ABOVE MY BED I'LL DO THAT IF I'M IN A READ IN BED I MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FALLSE SLEEP PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED CORTICE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH ELIMINATING THE BLUE WAVE LANGSAID AND THEY TEND TO BE FAIRLY DIM AND UM NOW THERE'S ONE BRAND OF RED LIGHT THAT A YOU ACTUALLY CAN THE ASHA WILL WORK ON A DIMMER SO THIS IS IMPORTANT A I SUPPOSE YOU COULD USE A RED PARTY LIGHTS OR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS THOSE CAN BE VERY AFFORDABLE AM SOME PEOPLE DO THAT BUTS COUNTIFFESTIVE A FEEL IN THE ROOM OTHER PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF UM WILL UM YUSE A RED LIGHT THAT'S DIMMABLE I WANT A MENTION THAT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY I DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP TO THIS COMPANY IN TERMS OF THE BULBS A RED LIGHT PANELS ARE DIFFERENT I USE THE JU AH I USE JUVE TYPE BUT FOR RED LIGHTS THAT FOR THE PURPOSE I'M TALKING ABOU THAY WOULD GOING TO A STANDARD LAMP AND THAT YOU DIM WHERE THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE RIGHT THE RED LIGHT PANELS OF A VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE AN THEN RED BULBS THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN TO A STANDARD LIGHT FIXTURE A THE DIMABLE ONES A ARE CALLED THEY YOU CAN FIND THEM AS RED LIGHT AND JUST PUT BAWN AM IT'S ATHE TECHNICAL NAME A OF THE COMPANY IS UM SORRY FORGIVE ME FOR GROUGGLING THIS NOW YE IT'S A BON CHARGE B O AND SEPARATE WERE CHARGE EM AND THOSE ARE DIMABLE AND THEY HAVE THE PROPER WAVE LINGS O THAT'S WHAT I USE EM THEY'RE NOT SUPERCHEAP BUT THEY'RE NOT EXPENSIVE EITHER IN CUTTIN COMPARISON TO MOST A RED LIGHT THARAPIES OR SOMETHING SO WE'RE NOT SO WHAT RED LIGHT THERAPPY WERE TLLING ABOUT REDUCING THE OVER ALL MOUNT OF BLUE LIGHT IN YOU ENVIRONMENT AT CETERAE NOW FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO PURCHASE SOMETHING NEW AND AGAIN I'VE NO FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP TO BON CHARGE SO I DON'TGLEAN ANY THING I BUY THEM WITH MY OWN MONEY AND I JUST HAVE ONE OR TWO IT THEM THAN I DIM THE LIGHTS EVEN THOSE RED LIGHTS I DIM WHILE I'M READING AT NIGHT THEN FALL ASLEEP IF YOU DON'T WANT YOU IS RED LIGHTS FOR WHATEVER REASON THEN YOU WOULD BE WIYES TO JUST DIM THE LIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE AND WHERE POSSIBLE TO HAVE THOSE LIGHTS BESET FAIRLY LOW IN YOUR ROOM ENVIRONMENT NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE O CAE WILL FIRST OF ALL THE CELLS THAT ACTIVATE THE ALERTNESS SYSTEM A IN THE BRAIN THROUGH I O THE RETNA YOU'R EYE A TEND TO LOOK UP INTO YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND IMAC SENSE BECAUSE THEYRE ESSENTIALLY THERE TO VIEW SUNLIGHT AND THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SUNLIGHT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THINK ABOUT IT LOGICALLY IF I TAKE A FLASH LIGHT AND I SHINE AF BEAM ON THE GROUND OR AT A TREE IN THE YARD IT LOOKS VERY BRIGHT BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING ALL THOSE PHOTONS IN YOUR EYES RIGHT YOU'RE SEEING IT AT A DISTANCE I SUPPOSE TO SHINING THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES IT'S VERY VERY BRIGHT O KE SO WHNYOU HAVE LIGHTS THAT ARE OVERHEAD AND GOING INTO YOUR EYES IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IN THE LIGHT BEING ON THE FLOOR OR ON A SURFACE THIS GETS BACK TO SOMETHING THAT I OFTENG GET ASKED HOW COULD IT BE THAT VIEWING SUNLIGHT THROUGH A WINDOW TAKES FIFTY TIMES LONGER TO ACTIVATE YOUR CIRCADEAN SYSTEM THAN IT DOES WHEN YOU STEP OUTSIDE WILL IT'S THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU STEP OUTSIDE THEIR SUNLIGHT EVERYWHERE IF YOU FACE THE SUN THERE'S EVEN MORE COMING AT YOU BUT WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE UNLESSTHERE'S A BEAM OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THAT WINDOW AND THE WINDOW IS VERY CLEAR OR OPEN FOR THAT MATTER YOU'RE NOT REALLY GETTING THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES IN THE SAME WAY THAT IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE WITH THE SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES RIGHT IT'S THE SAME THING IS LIKE LOOKING IT A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM A FLASHLIGHT AGAINST A WALVERS AS THE BEAM OF LIGHT GOING AT YOUR EYES OKET SO WE TALKED ABOUT A'M DIMMING THE LIGHTS SETTING THEM LOW IN THE ROOM THE I IT'S NOT RED LIGHT THERIPY BUT CHANGING OVER TO RED LIGHTS PON CHARGE IS PYHT JUST ONE OF MANY OUT THERE I'VE SEEN IT DONE PRETTY NICELY WITH JUST SOMEBODY A PEOPLE GRAB RED PARTY LIGHTS GO ON WHATEVER YOUR FAVOURITE SURCH ENGINESAL SIDE INE RED LIGHTS AND YO COAN O THAT THAT'S CAN BE BETTER THAN ANY BLUE LIGHTS AND THEN IF YOU CAN BE ON YOUR SCREENS HERE'S WHAT I SUGGESTIS A SHORT A CUT FUNCTION IN YOUR PHONE WHERE YOU CAN TRIPLE CLICK TO SWITCH YOUR PHONE OVER TO ELIMINATE ALL THE BLUES THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THEN JUST USING THE NIGHT TIME TFUNCTION VERY DIFFERENT AND A I THIN WE SHULD RY PUT OUT OF VIDION HOW TO DO THIS BUT WHAT YOU DO AS YOU GOING TO THE ACCESSIBILITY FUNCTION ON YOUR PHONE YOU GOING TO COLOR FILTERS AND THEN YOU DR RAG DOWN THE THE BLUES BUT THAT'S NOT HIGYOUR PHONAS GING TO BE SET ALL DAGHT CAUSE THEN YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT'S IN BLUE BUT YOU CAN INTRODUCE A TRIPLE CLIC FUNCTION I'LL PUT OUT ECLIPS SOON ON HOW TO DO THAT A SO WHEN I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT OR IN THE EVENING WHAT I'LL DO AS A'LL TRIPLE CLICK AND ALL SWITCH MY PHONE OVER TO A TO RED ONLY AND THAT'S COMPLETELY ZERO COST BY THE WAY IT DOESN'T CAST ANYTHING AND THEN IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP AT CLICLICLIC I TURN ON ALTHOUGH I TRYING AT THE SUNLIGHT AN MILES BEFORE I LOOK AT MY FHONE OKAT TOM M ASKS LIGHT THERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THOSE THAT LIVE IN NORTHERN REGIONS WITH LIMITED MORNING LIGHT OR TWO COLD TO GET OUTSIDE FOR MORNING LIGHT DARK WEN WAKING DO RED LIGHT THERAPY GREAT QUESTION AN TAKE A SIP OF THIS BONE BROG BECAUSE THE RATE OM SPEAKING IF I TRY AN KEEP THIS UP FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF I I MIGHT UM GET A LITTLE HORSE RED LIGHT THERAPY IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED RED LIGHT THERAPY IS THE USE A RED LIGHT PANELS T CAN BE SMALLER PANELS LIKE THE SMALL JUVE THAT I USE WHICH IS A YOU NITS ABOUT THE SIZE OF PIECIGUS THEY CALL TEXAS TOAST THEY TTECA THICK PIECE OF TOAST IMAMISON KNOWS WHY IT'S CALLED TEXUSTOS UM E GIZZAS BIG UM ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PIECE OF TOAST PROVIDES VERY BRIGHT RED LIGHT AND IN BETWEEN THOSE RED LIGHTS ON THERE THERE TENDS TO BE NEAR IMPHER RED LIGHT SO FAR RED SO UM YOU KNOW TO A BY ALL JIST RED DOESN'T MEAN AS MUCH AS THE WAVE LENGTH OF LIGHTS O WAVELINGS AN LIKHT THE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO EIGHT HUNDRED ANIMATERS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE AS BLUE LIGHT IS DOWN IN THE YOU KOW FOUR AND FIVE HUNDREDS AND REALLY LIKE FIVE THIRTY FIVE TO YOU KNOW LOW SIXES UM YU LIKE THE RAINBOW RIGHT UM RED ORENTRI A GREEN BLUE UM THER ARE ALSO LARGER RED LIGHT PANELS AND NOWADAYS I ALSO SEE A LOT OF A ADVERTISEMENTS FOR RED LIGHT PANELS HE GASHLY LIGHT DOWN IN RED LIGHT BEDS HERE'S THE STORY RED LIGHT WE'LL OFTEN BE MARKETED AS THE MOST POWERFUL THE MOST INTENSITY THE MOST LOCKS MOST IMPORTANT IS THE PROPER WAVE LENGTHS OR ARE THE PROPER WAVE LENGTHS SO AND THAT'S WHY USE THE JUVE BECAUSE JVE HAS THE PROPER WAVE LINGS OF RED AND FAR RED THE DISTANCE TO VIEW A RED LIGHT OF THAT SORT GENERALLY IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES SOMETIMES A LITL CLOSER NOWL SOME NICE PEOPLE W PUT RED LIGHT ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THEIR BODY I COVERED A BIT OF THIS IN THE LIGHT AND HEALTH EPISODE BUT RED LIGHT BECAUSE IT'S LONGER WAVELENGTH LIGHT CAN PERMEATE THROUGH TISSUES TO FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL DEPTH HOW DEEP DEPENDS ON THE TISSUE IF YOU PUT UP AGAINST YOUR SKULL IS AGIN TO GET DOWN INTO YOUR BRAIN NO IT'S NOT CKINGTO GET THROUGH YOUR SKULL MAY BE A LITTLE BIT IF IT'S A VERY HIGH POWERED RED LIGHT IF YOU'RE HOLDING A RED LIGHT OF THAT POWER AT HOME SOMETHINGS WRONG I DON'T THAT'S A MEDICAL IT'S A MEDICAL DEVICE HOWEVER JEU ARE MEDICAL GRADE RED LIGHT AND NEAR HIM FOR RED LIGHTS AND THEY UM ARE QUITE POWERFUL THERG THE RIGHT WAVELENTS ICTUALLY THAT'S WHY I PREFER JUVE BECAUSE THEY ARE UM THEY ARE MEDICAL GRADE UM THEY CAN BE DIRECTED AT YOUR EYES IN THE MORNING FOR THE PURPOS OF THERE'S A A STUDY OUT OF TWO STUDIES ACTULY OUT OF GLEN JEFFREY'S LABORATORY TH UNIVERS C OLLEGE LONDON SHOWING THAT VIEWING RED LIGHTS AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES OR SO IN THE MORNING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER FORTY BUT NOT FOR PEOPLE YOUNGER BY THE WAY THAT CAN OFFSET SUM OF THE AGE RELATED REDUCTIONS IN MATICONDR FUNCTION AND VISION LOSS SO I LOOK AT A RED LIGHT IN THIS YOU MYHT JOU TEXAS TOST LIGHT OR EVER A JOF PANEL AM AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT I CONFESS I STAND ABOUT TWELVE TO SITO EIGHTEEN INCHES AWAY AND I DO NOT FORCE MYSELF TO LOOK AT THAT LIGHT I DON'T HOLD MY EYELIDS OPEN I ALLOW MYSELF TO BLINK SI'M COMFORTABLE TRUTH TOLD YOU PROBABLY CLOSE YOUR EYELIDS AND SOME OF THAT RED LIGHT AS CAN TO GET THROUGH YOUR EYELIDS NOT A TON BUT SOME SO NO PROBLEM BLINKING YOU NEVER EVER EVER WHONE TA LOK AT ANY LIGHT SUNLIGHT OR OTHERWISE RED LIGHT ANY LIGHT SO BRIGHT THATIT'S PAINFUL TO LOOK AT IF YOU HAVE TO BLINK IT'S TOO BRIGHT STEP BACK IF YOU HAVE TO BLINK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THAT'S SOOK CABUT IF YOU HAVE TO BLINK IN ORDER TO TO CLOSE YOUR EYES IN ODER PROTECT YOUR EYES THEN YOU'RE STANDING TOO CLOSE IN THE MORNING YOU CAN DO RED LIGHT SARAPE ON SKIN YOU CAN DO IT ON EYES WILL IT WAKE YOUR SYSTEM UP WILL IT PROVIDE THE KIND OF A QUARTERS ALL INCREASE WHICH BY THE WAY YOU WANT EARLY IN THE DAY AND A DRENDLEIN A DOPEMINE INCREASE THAT SUNLIGHT CAN PROVIDE THE ANSWER IS NO SUNLIGHT AS YOU NIQUE IN THAT WAY HOWEVER IF YOU LIVIN AN AREA OF THE WORLD THAT'S TOO DARK OR AM YOU WAKE UP LONG BEFORE YOU GET SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES WHAT CAN YOU DO WELL YOU CAN FLIP ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS YOU DO THAT THE OPPOSITE OF HOW I RECOMMEND IN THE EVENING YOU'D WANT A FLIP ON OVERHEAD LIGHTS AS BRIGHT AS POSSIBLE IF YOU A HAVE THE DISPOSABLE INCOME AND YOU WANT TO INVEST IN A TEN THOUSAND LUCKS LIGHT PANEL OR NINE HUNDRED LUCKS LIGHT PANEL AGAIN IHAVE NO FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP TO THESE COMPANIES BUT AM THERE'S A LIGHT PANEL NINE HUNDRED LUCKS DRAWING TABLET THAT I'VE SET ON MY DESK FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS RECENTLY I CONFESS I'VE STARTED UM A EXPERIMENTING WITH SOME OF THE TEN THOUSAND LUCKS LIGHT PANELS THAT SIT ON YOUR DECKS DESK EXCUSE ME THOSE ARE VERY VERY BRIGHT AND I DO USE THAT NOW IF I WAKE UP EARLY EARLY IN IMIN TO DO SOME WORK I'LL TURN THAT THING ON AND IT SURE WAKES YOU UP NOW IS IT AS GOOD AS SUNLIGHT NO IT DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT COLOR FEATURES AND ALTERNATION BETWEEN YELLOW AND BLUE THAT MORNING SUNLIGHT HAS AND THAT EVENING SUNLIGHT HAS AND WITHOUT DOING A WHOLE TUTORIAL WHEN THE SUN IS LOW IN THE SKY SO CALL LO SOL OR ANGLE SUNLIGHT YOU'LL NOSE IF YOU TAKE A PICTURE WITH YOUR PHONE PROVIDES NOT A CLOUDY DAY YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BLUE YELLOW CONTRAST AND THAT'S THE OPTIMAL STIMULUS THAT SAID IF IT'S OVERCAST OUT YU SHOULD STILL GET OUTSIDE BECAUE SOME OF THOSE WAY Y LINGS ARE COMING THROUGH EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T PERCEIVE THE BLUE IN THE YELLOW SO THESE YOU COAN GET A TEN THOUSAND LUCKS LIGHT BUT IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT OR YOU DON'T WANT TO OH AND BY THE WAY THOSE YOU YOU SET ON YOUR DESK YOU TURN ON FOR FIVE TEN MINUTES WHILE YOUR MAKING COFF HERE IN THINGS THAT SORT THE ACTUON RECOMMEND THYU DON'T KEEP THEM ON TOO MUCH SOME PEOPLE ASHE CIN FEEL  TO YOU FOR I CAN MAVE EVEN GEL LL HEADACE AS IT'S A LOT OF BLUE LIGHT SO THAT'S ONE THING THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T A A ACCESS LIGHT OF ANY KINDS A DARK DARK DARK THAT'S WHERE THE COLD CHOWER REALLYK AN HELP COULD YU GET THAT A DRENAL AND BUMP AM EARLY IN THE DAY WHICH IS GOODSO EARLY NL E DAY YOU KNOW PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT GOING INTO STATES OF ANGAS IDY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF IT GETTING A DRENDLE IN DOPAMEAN CARTERS ALL INCREASES AS GREAT AND THEN AS THE DAY GOES ON AND THE EVENING AND NIGHT TIMES CERTAINLY YOU WANT A TAPER TALE LEVELS OF THOSE NARROW CHEMICALS OFF NOW OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS GING TO BE SOME QUARTERS ALL THERS ALWAYS GOIN O BE SOME UPIND EFERAN THERE ALWAYS BE DOPAMENA YOUR SYSETEM IF YOU GOT DANCING YOU GO TO A PARTY AT NIGHT SHOULD YOU WORRY ABOUT THE LIGHTS NOW GAY I HAM NOT DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT PRESUME OR HEAR READ I HAM NOT A THES FORT A PERSON WERE SON GLASSES AN A PARTY ALTHOUGH THE OTHER DAY I WAS AT A PARTY IN SOME ON WAS WEARING SOME LAST I THEKNOWS FOR OTHER REASONS THE A THE THAT A THAT GIVES THE IMPRESSION HER WITH SOMETHING BAD GOING ON I THINK THY WERE JUST LIKE LOOKING COOL BY THE WAY AM AND THEY DID LOOK COOL BUT I DON'T DO THAT AND IF I DRIVE AT NIGHT AT AN WERE I DON'T WERE AM SUN GLASSES I DO AND I HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THE USE OF A BLUE LIGHT FILTER GLASSES IN THE EVENING AND THOSE RED LIGHTS IN MY HOUSE BUT FRE THEM FOR MOST PEOPLE IF YOU GET OUT EVERY ONE SO LO GO OUT TIL LATE NIGHT YOU OUT DANCING YOU HAE A PARTY WITH FRIENDS NAN W YO GET HOME DIM THE LIGHTS BUSES THOSE RED LIGHTS GETS ASLEEP EARLY IN THE DAY BRIGHT LIGHTS I DEALLY FROM SUNLIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT HOW BRIGHT AS BRIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND AS MANY AS YOU A IS REASONABLE EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT COULD DAMAGE YOUR EYES O DON'T BE STARING AT ANY BRIGHT LIGHTS SUCCESSIVELY OKA I THINK THAT A PREMUCH SUMMERISES IT AND  OF COURSE EARLY DAY IT'S REALLY ABOUT SUNLIGHT OR LIGHT OF OTHER KINDS COLD WATER IF THAT'S YOUR THING IF THAT'S NOT YOUR THING THAT'S FINE THERE WAS NO TABLET THAT A DESCENDED DOWN TO US TELLING US THAT WE HAD TO GET INTO COLD WATER EACH DAY IT'S AN OPTION IT'S ALL AN OPTION DENIS FROM MUNUCH I MUNUCH IN THERE IN A WHILE BUT S TO GO AN MOCKS PLONKI MUNUCH FOR A NUMBER OF UM TIMES BREER YEAR AND I MIS THE FOOD A MISE CHNIZIL AS WE APPROACH A NEW YEAR WHAT HEALTH AND FITNESS METRICS YOU RECOMMEND CHECKING OH GOOD ONE AND COULD YOU SHARE YOUR ANNUAL MEDICAL FITNESS CHECK ROUTINE OKE A WHAT AM ABOUT TO SAY I'M SURE WILL U GENERALLY JIB WITH WHAT DOCTOR PETER ATIA WHO I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW N I M RESPECT TREMENDOUSLY ALSO GRATEFUL TO COMA CLOSE FRIEND A BASICALLY ASSERTS IS IMPORTANT FOR FITNESS A I THINK IF YOU'RE GIN TO DO A FITNESS TAST YOU KOW PETERS GOT IT IN MIND AND I GENERALLY GREE YOU KNOW DEDLIF YOUR BODY WEIGHT TEN TIMES IN THE SAME SET HANG FROM A BAR FOR A MINUTE OR MORE OK IN THE SAME SAT A THESE SORTS OF THINGS I TEND TO BE FAR LESS P E CLASS ABOUT IT FRANKLY A MIGEL IS ALWAYS THE SAME AM FORTY EGHT YEARS OLD I'VE BEN DOING THE SAME TRAINING PROGRAM EVER SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN MORE OR LESS I MAN IAVE HAD YOUNW IT YOU KNOW PEAKS AND VALLEYS AN TERMS OF MY CONSISTENCY BASED ON OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND COURSE WHEN I'M SICK I DON'T TRAIN SICK PEOPLE STAY OUT OF GIMS PLEASE NOTHING MAKES ME MORE FRUSTRATED THAN PEOPLE SHOWING UP TO GET THEIR WORK OUT AND GETTING EVERYBODY SICK HERE'S THE DEAL I TRY TO BEEK CAPABLE THAT IS READY FOR VARIOUS THINGS WHAT THE ABILITY TO GO ON A LONG HEIKE WHAT'S A LONG HEIKE FIVE TO TEN MILES WITH SOME HILLS THE ABILITY TO SPRINT FOR THE AIRPLANE WITHOUT BLOWING A GASKET THE ABILITY OR THAT MEANS HURTING ONESELF FOR HAVING A HRITAC THE ABILITY TO CARRY SOME HEAVERY FURNITURE WITH ASSISTANCE SAFELY OR GOD FORBID TO TAKE A TRIP AND NOT DAMAGE MYSELF AND OF COURSE TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF AGILITY AND ACORDINATION SO HOW HOW DOES ONE DO THAT SO WHAT HELP FITNESS METRIC TO I RECCOMMEND CHECKING WELL I'M IN TO DO THIS NEXT WEEK BECAUSES IT'S THE END OF THE YEAR BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERY WEEK IT'S THE FOLLOWING THREE CARTY VASCULAR TRAINING SESSIONS ONE IS LONG MEANING AN HOUR TO NINETY MINUTES THAT'S CAN BE SLOW FOR ME SO THIS COULD BE A WEIGHTED HIKE SO WEIGHT VESTED HIKE RE GOU JUST PUT SOME WEIHT IN A BACKPACK WER JUST BE A HEIKE IF IT'S REALLY STEEP OR A LONGSLOW JOG ONCE A WEEK FOR ME IT'S JOGGING OR HIKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE CYCLING OR SWIMMING SOME TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF WEEK I'M DOING A THIRTY FIVE MINUTE RUN SO MAY BE FIVE MINUTES OF WARM UP AND THEN A FASTER OR THIRTY FIVE MINUTE RUN GET ALSO DO IT O ROWER YOU COULD ALSO DO ON BIKE BUT YOU'E REALLY PUSHING UP AROUND IONO MAY BE I I DON'T TEND TO MEASURE HEART RATE BUT WHERE IT'S I COULD NOT HOLD A CONVERSATION I'M WORKING I'M WORKING WORKING I'M NOT SPRINTING BUT I'M WORKING AND THEN ANOTHER TIME DURING THE WEEK A SHORTER WORK OUT OF A TWELVE MINUTES S TO GIVE ME THREE MINUTES OF WARM UP SOME CALSTHENICS LITTLE BIT OF CYCLING ON AN A SALT BIKE OR SOMETHING THAT SORT OF SALT BIKES FO THE ONES WHERE YOU HAVE THE HANDLES WITH THE FAN WORK OF THE A RAIL OR OR COULD BE ANY SPRINTING HILL AND THEN DOING SOMETIMES ONE MINUTE ON ONE MINUTE OF FOR TWELVE MINUTES SOMETIMES DOING TWENTY SECONDS ON TEN SECONDS OFF FOR EIGHT ROUNDS AND IT'S REAL WORK IT'S GETTING THE HART RAHE ALL THE WAY UP VEO TWO MACKS THE COMMINATION OF THOSE THREE TYPES OF CARTY OF ASCULAR TRAINING SESSIONS AR THAT I'M READY TO SPRINT FOR THE AIRPLANE I'M READY TO TAKE A LONG HEIKE ANY TIME I'M I CAN GO OUT FOR A TWO MILE RUN AND REALLY ENJOY THAT IF I FI NEED TO IT'S A READINESS THING AND I THINK IT COVERS ALL BASIS AM I EVER GOING TO BE A MARITHONOR OR A CHAMPION SPRINTER WITH THAT OR A MILE OR NO BUT THAT'S NOT MY GOAL AND IT NEVER HAS BEEN I RAN A CROSS COUNTRY RACES IN HIGH SCHOOL AND TELL OUT STORY ANOTHER TIME IT WAS E LOFT FUN UNTIL I HAT THE SECOND MI THE OTHER THING I DO THREE TIMES A WEEK AS I WORK OUT WITH THE RESISTANCE TRAINING I TRAIN MY LEGS ONE DAY SO THAT'S CALVES HAMSTRINGS QUADS I TRAIN MY TOR SO SO THATS I DO SOME PUSHING FOR MY SHOULDERS AN UPPERCHESTN SOME DIPS THAT KIND OF THINGS SOME PULL UP SOME ROWING THE SORT THING I TRAIN MY NECK AS IM MA BIG BELIEVER IN THAT FOR THE UPPER SPINE BUT IM DON'T DON'T GO AT IT HEAVY IS JUST REALLY TO MAINTAIN YOU KNOW A POSTURE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT UP WIT UPPER SPINE IS SUPPORTED SOMETHINGTHAT MOST PEOPLE NEGLECT AND THEN ONE DAY A WEEK I DO SMALLER BODY PARTS LIKE I'LL DO MY CAP THE TRAIN MY CAVS AGAIN BISIPS TRICEPS I'LL MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE ANY SMALL BODY PARTS THAT HAPPEN A MISS DURING THE MILLE THE WEEK BECAUSE OF SCHEDUING LIKE REARDELT OR SONE THE I'LL DO THAT MAY BE LO IT MORE NECK WORK OR SOME ABWORK OQE THOSE ARE SPREAD OUT ABOUT A DAY APART I DON'T GET TOO OBSESSED WITH THE SPACING BETWEEN THOSE WORK OUTS BUT THEY'RE NOT ALL STACKED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER SO MIGHT BE IN MY CASE IT'S IT'S LONG RUN ON SUNDAY THIS IS JUST HOW I DO IT MONDAY TENDS TO BE OFF A EXCUSE ME LONG RUN ON SUNDAY OR HIKE MONDAY IS LEGS SCUSES ME MONDAY IS ALWAYS LEGS TUESDAY OFF WEDNESDAY I GENERALLY WOUD DO THAT SHORTER RUN OR THE TORSO WORK I FLIT FLOP THEM DEPENDING ON HOW MY LEGS ARE FEELING AND THE NEXT DAY I DO WHATEVER I NEED TO DO EITHER THE TORSO RESISTANCE TRAINING OR OR THE THIRTY FIVE MINUTE RUN AND THEN FRIDAYS THAT FASTER CLIP CARDIO SATURDAY TENDS TO BE THE SMALLER BODY PARTS BISIPS TRISIPS ET CETERA I MUST SAY THESE DAYS OF THE WEEK ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILI ABILITY TO SLIDE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SO FOR INSTANCE IF I'M TRAVELLING AND I DON'T GET BACK ON SUNDAY OUT UNTIL LATE I'LL IF I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO THAT TRAINING WHILES ON THE ROAD THAN I WILL DO IT ON MONDAY AND THEN I' JUST SLIDE THINGS AROUND SO THAT I FINISH OFF THE WEEK WITH EVERYTHING DONE AND I CAN GET BACK ON SCHEDUAL BUT THE WAY OVE ARRANGED IT EVERYBODY PARK GETS IT TWICE ONCE DIRECTLY ONCE INDIRECTLY AND THE CARTVASCULAR TRAINING IS IS COVERS ALL BASIS WHY TRAIN THIS WAY WELL IT IN SURE STRENGTH IT INSURES WHATEVER ESTHETIC CHANGES YOU WANT YOU CAN EMPHASIZE WORKING HARDER AND MORE SETS PERHAPS FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU YOU KNOW WONE A BRING UP CERTAIN BODY PARTS CETERA AT AE WEEKER YOU CAN AM CERTAINLY RECOVER CAUS YOUR ONLY TRAINING LIKES ONCE A WEEK BUT GETS WHAT YOUR YOU'RE DOING THEM ON MONDAY IND YOU'RE SPRINTING ON FRIDAY SO THEYRE GETTING HIT INDIRECTLY ON FRIDAY EVEN IF IT'S ON THE BIKE THOSE THAT FAST HARD PEDDLING WITH RESISTANCE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LEGS AREN'T GINGT ATROPHY CAN STILL GET BUT YOU CAN STILL TRAIN THEM AGAIN ON MONDAY AGAIN SO THIS SCHEDUL IS DESIGN IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY NONE OF THE WORK OUTS EXCEPT THE LONGER WORK OUT ON SUNDAY THAT A JOGER RUNNERS LONGER THAN AN HOUR EVER IT'S TEN MINUTES A WARM UP IN FIFTY FIVES YERE MINUTES OF WORK IN THE GIMS SOMETIMES SIXTY SOMETIMES ALL TRUNCADES OF FORTY FIVE OR FORTY IF I'M REALLY I HAVE A BUNCH OF THINGS GOING ON SO THIS SORT OF SCHEDUL SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S NOT IT'S ACTUALLY OF VERY SMALL INVESTENS BYU AN HOUR A DAY AND NOT EVEN ON TUESDAY WHICH IS A REST DAY SO WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT I RECOMMEND CHECKING WELL I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT IF YOU'RE SLEEPING WELL YOU'R APPETITE IS CONSISTENT AND YOU'R FEELING GENERALLY GOOD THAT'S AN IMPORTANT METRIC IT'SA VERY SUBJECTIVE METRIC BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT ARE YOU SLEEPING WELL ORRE YOU WAKING UP SORE AND YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO RECOVER ARE YOU FEELING LIKE NO MATTER HOW MUCH SLEEP YOU GET YOU CAN'T FEEL REST ED THESE KINDS OF THINGS NOW THERE COULD BE OTHER FACTORS INVALLE BUT THAT'S THE YOU KNOW SORT OF BASIC ONE THE OTHER ONE IS HOW MUCH ENERGY AND PEP ARE YOU BRINGING TO YOUR WORK OUTS THAT'S IMPORTANT AND IT WERE LATE TO CAFIEN AND FUELING IN ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WHICH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RAY NOWCE FAR TOO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT HERE BUT WE DID COVER ING THE FOUNDATIONAL THITNESS PROTOCALL BY THE WAY ALL OF THIS IS PUT INTO A PETY F THAT'S AF AILBON LINE AT HOU REMIN LATDOCK CALMS YOURO COST SIMPLY GO TO THE NEWS LETTER TTHAT TAB UNDER THE MANOU AND YOU CAN SCROLL DOWN IM BLAA FING THE FOUNDATIONAL FITNESS PROTICALL GETS INTO SETS AND RAPS AND LOADS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF COMPLETELY OUR O COST I DO TAKE MY MORNING RESTING PULSERYT I KNOW WHAT MY PULSERATE OUGHT TO BE IF IT'S ELEVATED SUBSTANTIALLY AND I'M NOT PARTICULARLY STRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING THEN I'M MI PAY ATTENTION TO THAT AND BACK OFF A LO BIT IN THE INTENSITY ON THINGS IF I'AVE A THROAT TICKLER I'M NOT FEELING VERY WELL I'M REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT WORKING OUT SOMETIMES I'LL DO IT SOMETIMES I WONT I'LL MAKE SURE THAT ISN'T JUST SOME SORT OF LIKE DUST OR ALORGEN IN THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IF I'M FEELING UNDER THE WEATHER I'LL TAKE I'LL JUST SKIP I SKIPED THAT WORK OUT AND SOME YO WILL GO YOU SKIP BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU I'LL BE HONEST I'M FORTY EIGHT BEEN TRAINING VERY CONSISTENTLY I AM FORTUNATELY KNOCKUM WOULD WILL BE SUSPICIOUS KNOCKHAM WOOD I HAVE AVOIDED MAJOR INJURIES I'VE BEEN ABLE TRAIN CONSISTENTLY AND I'VE ALSO DON'T TEND TO SUCCUMB TO COLDS AND FLUES I THINK ABOUT ONCE EVERY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS I'VE HAD A COLD ER FLEW OF SOME SORT FOR FOR MANY YEARS THAT'S BEEN THE THE KIND OF CADENCS BUT NOT MORE FREQUENT THAN THAT I THINK IN PART BECAUSE I DON'T TEND TO PUSH REALLY HARD WHEN I'M SICK I TEND TO BE THE GUY GOS RIGHT I'M I'M FEELING COUNT UNDER THE WEATHER SHI TRAIN MAY BE NOT OF COMING TO TAKE A HOT SHOWER AND GET IN BED AT SIX P M READ ING GO TO SLEEP IF I WAKE UP AT THREE A M BECAUSE I WENT TO BED TO EARLY CHILLING BED AND READ MAY FALL BACK TO SLEEP MAY BE NOT I THINK TAKING CARE OF ONESELF IN THAT WAY IS VERY BENEFICIAL AND THEN PEOPLE SAY WILL YOU HAVE AN AD KIDS  I'VE HAD KIDS IN THE HOUSE AND I ALSO KNOW WHAT IT IS TO GET SICK BECAUSE O RUMATES AN ALL THE STUFF IND WORKING WITH PEOPLE AN WORKING IN A MEDICAL SENTER YOURE ALWAYS EXPOSED TO THING SO I'M I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR WE CANT AVOID EXPOSURE TO I'M INFECTIOUS VECTORS N AS THEY'RE CALLED I'M DELIGHTFUL IN THE FORM OF KIDS BUT I THE REALITY IS I TRYIN BACK OFF WHEN I'M NOT FEELING WELL I PUSH WHEN I'M FEELING GOOD I'M NOT ONE TO DO TO A DAY WORK OUTS AND I'M VERY CAREFUL ABOUT NOT EXCEEDING MY MY PROGRAM I I'M VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT I DON'T GO CRAZY I DON'T DO TOO POLLOTIES CLASSES THAN GO TO THE GIM AND I'MALSO NOT THE I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS BACK OR ALWAYS BEING SICK AND I DO NOT HAVE YOUNO LIK PHENOMENAL GENETICS FOR WIH RESPECT TO FITNESS YOUI'M SMALL JOINTED OR RELATIVELY EVE A MEDIUM SIZE JOINTS YOU KNOW I'M NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG NOR DO IHAVE PARTICULARLY STRONG IN DURANCE YOU KNOW I THINK I'M CONV N THE MIDDLE SO IN TRMS OF MEDICAL FITNESS CHECK I DO BLOOD WORK EVERY SIX MONTHS I FIND THAT TO BE THAT IS IDENTIFIED A FEW THINGS THAT FOR ME NEEDED TAKING CARE OF AND I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO OVER ALL FEELINGS OF WELL BEING AND I CHART THEM FRANKLY I ON MY CALENDER IS MY ARE MY WORK OUT IT BUT THE LEVEL I PUT LAY ELL ONE TO TEN TO LY MY WORK OUTS OR IN THE SIX TO EIGHT OUT OF TEN INTENSITY I'M NOT MEASURING THIS UP BY ANY KIND OF I'M DEVICE AND IF I GET SICK I TEND TO LOOK BACK AND SAY WHAT WAS GOING ON BEFORE I GOT SICK YOU KNOW I'M IF I'M  GETTING SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKER OR I'M FEELING O FATIGUE I I I TAKE STOCK OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO I THINK I'M SOME YOU 'LL GET THE IMPRESSION TANLY HI BRANALITIC ABOUT ALL THINGIS AND AM YOU KOW I WOULD SAY A TEAS MUCH MORE INTO MEASURING THINGS AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT HIM I'M MORE OF THE MIND SET LE CII IF I'M FEELING GOOD AND I FEEL IN LIKE I CAN MOVE MY BODY WELL NOT TO ANY AKES IN PAINS ICCATION I GET A LITTLE SOMETHING OF A LOB O DISBOULDER SOMETHING BUT AND  THEN  TAKE CARE OF IT BUT IN GENERAL IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO FEEL GOOD SEATED FEEL GOOD MOVING BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT READINESS READINESS READINESS FOR ME THAT'S THE FOUNDATION OF OF HEALTH SO A OTHER A THINGS YOU GET A REGULAR AGS AN I DO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT OPTHEMOLOGY DEPARTMENT DO THAT AIR PUFFTES FOR GLACOMA THERE ARE TREATMENTS FOR GLACOMA BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T NOW IF THEY HAVE IT IT IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE O BLINDNESS WORLD WIDES I CAN ONLY CATARACT IT'S VERY EASY TAST YOU GANGET FROM OPTOMATRIS OR OPTHEMOLOGIST GET THAT I TISS YOUR VISION IS SO PRECIOUS INVISION IS SO PRECIOUS SO I I CAN'T OVERSTATE THAT ENOUGH A GENERALLY PRETTY INEXPENSIVE AS WELL SPECIALLY FROM THE OPTOMATRIS AND THE DROP'S WORK POBLOEV ASKS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH WAKING UP WIT TH MILL ANDNIGHT AND CAN'T GO BACK TO SLEEP OH SUCH A GOOD QUESTION I HAVE THREE DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT I USE FIRST OF ALL LONG EXAIL BREATHING JUST TO TRYING CALL MYSELF I WAS A TRAN RELAX MY FACE IF I DO THIS RIGHTNOU NCEI ME FUNNMY BUT RELAXING THE FACE TENDS TO RELAX THE JAW AND THEN O'N DO A PROGRESSIVE BODY RELAXATION I DO USE THE REVERI R  V E R I AP AND THEY AVE A SPECIFIC HYPNOSIS FOR FALLING BACK ASLEEP HYPNOSIS IS SELF DIRECTED HYPNOSIS DAVID'SPEAGLE WHO'S BEEN AGAINST ON THE PODCAS IS VOICE IS TERRIFIC FOR HYPNOSIS YOU MEN JUST THINK AMA'S VOICE MAKES ME WANE TO GO ONDER THYPICALLY WITH REVERY YOU PRACTISE THE FALLING ASLEEP FALLING BACK TO SLEEP HYPNOSIS ONLY EIGHT MINUTES LONG YOU PRACTISE THAT THE DAYTIME AND THEN YOU CAN USE IN THE MILL THE NIGHT IF YOU NEED TO THAT DOES REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE PRESENT AND BY THE WAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT HYPNOSIS YOU CAN SELECT WHETHEROR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE ONE WERE YOU HAVE TO INTERRACT AND SPEAK ERE NOT I LIKE THE ON WRE  DON'T INTERACT ALSO IF YOU SLEEP NEX TO SOME ONE IT WON'T WAKE THEM UGH REVERY'S GREAT FOR THIS PURPOSE AND AND YOU MIGHT THINK HYPNOSIS THAT'S WACKY OR THAT'S A NOUNOMAGIC CARPETSTO BUT IT'S NOT THIS IS A YOU NOW HYPNOSIS BY THE WAY IS ONE OF THE FEW A PROVED MEDICAL TREATMENTS FOR VERY PSYCHOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS WERE NOT TALKIN ABOUT STAGESHYPNOSIS PEOPLE CLUCKING LIKE CHICKENS WER TULKIN ABOUT YOU LEARNING TO SELF DIRECT RELAXATION WHICH IS A SKILL THAT YOU CAN INHANCE IN HYPNOSIS SUCH AS WITH REVERY I THINK REVERY NOW IS A A FREE TRIAL ANDS VAILBLE AND ANTROID AN APPLE AND IT'S A NOMINAL COST WHEN YOU COMPARE TO THING IS LIKE SUPPLEMENTS OR SLEEPING BILLS IT'S A FEW DOLLARS EACH MONTH IT BES SEVEN EIGHT DOLLARS SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOME ONE WILL TELL ME BUT IFYOUTHINK ABOUT THE COST RELATIVE TO YOU KNOW SOME OTHER PURCHASABLE IT'S RELATIVELY LOW THE OTHER THING AND THIS IS SOMETHING IS COMPLETELY YOURO COST AND I CAN'T ENCOURAGE IT ENOUGH IS THAT YOU GET INTO A REGULAR PRACTISE OF NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST AND ST ARE OR YOGANEDRA AND THAT YOU DO THAT DURING THE DAYTIME THERE'S A TEN MINUTE ANST R THAT I DID WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON YOU TOO BE JUST PUT ENIS TO AR HUBOR MINUTESOFVAIL COMPLETELY S YOUR COST IT WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO SELF DIRECT YOUR OWN RELAXATION AND YOU CAN ALL SE US IN THE MILL THE NIGHT IF YOU WAKE UP MANY PEOPLE FALL SLEEP DURING ANESTIARS THAT FINE OR YOGANEDRAS MANY OF WHICH ARE AVAILABLE ON THE INTRNET FREE OCARI COMPLETELY FOR YOGANEGERS A LILE BIT DIFFERENT THE ENESTY ARE IT IS A CATEGORY OF NON SLEEP DE BREAST THAT INCLUDES INTENTIONS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SELF DIRECTED RELAXATION BUT RELAXING IS A SKILL NOW THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO AVOID WAKING UP INTHE MILL THE IGHT ONE IS TRYING LIMIT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FLUID THAT YOU DRINK IN THE LAST COUPLE HOURS BEFORE SLEEP DON'T GO TO BED WITH A SUPERFULL BELLY AH SOME PEOPLE FIND THAT IF THEY TAKE THEONINE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS IN THE SLEEP STACK THAT I RECOMMEND AND BY THE WAY I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE NEDS TO TAKE SUPPLEMENTS IN ORDER O SLEEP I THIN YOU SHULD GET THE BEHAVIORAL STUFF THE LIGHT THE EXERCISE NOT DRINKI CAPIIN TO LATE IN THE DAY AVOIDING AL CAL IDEALLY COMPLETELY BUT MAYBE LATE IN THE DAY ESPECIALLY ET CETERA ET CETERA AND IF YOU CAN'T GET YOUR SLEEP RIGHT THAT WAY THEN PERHAPS YOU START TO RELY ON ER ENHANCE YOUR SLEEP CAPABILITIES WITH SUPPLEMENTS BUT THERE CERTAINLY NOT A REQUIREMENT THE SLEEP  SUPPLEMENT THEANINE WHICH IS IN THE SO CALLED HU WERE ING LAV SLEEP STACK WHICH IT INCLUDES MAGNEDSIUM THREE IN EIGHT AND APIGENANE AH AND THEONINE THEONINE FOR SOME PEOPLE CAN REALLY CRATE VIVID GREAMS AND THEN THEY WAKE UP FROM THOSE DREAMS THEY AVE HODTIME FALLING A SLEEP IN THAT CASE I WOULD JUST REDUCE THE DOSE A JOV OR ELIMINATE THE THEANIN SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO USE A NOCITALL NINE HUNDER MILEGRAMAN OCITALL BECAUSE THEY PREFER THAT AND IT WITHOT WORKS BETTER OR AH FOR THEM THEN THE SLEEP STACK OR SOME BE BELIEVE IN TAKE IT ADDITION OF THE SLEEP STACK UM AS LONG AS DOSAGES ARE FOLLOWED THERE'S NO REASON TO THING THAT ANY THE STUFF IT ISN'T SAFE BUT OF COURSE CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE ADDING OR REMOVING ANYTHING FROM YOUR SUPPLEMENT PROTOCALL OR ANY PROTOCOL FOR THAT MATTER I SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU NOT TO PROTECT ME THE OTHER THING THA YOU CAN DO IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT IS TO NOT LOOK AT THE TIME NOW THAT'S A LOV IT DIFFERECA IF YOU'RE GING A LOOK AT YOUR APHONE BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FOLKS AT THE STAMPFOR SLEEP CLENIC TAUGHT ME THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT THE TIME WHEN THEY WAKE UP IN TH MILL THE NIGHT GENERALLY HAVE A HARDER TIME FALLING BACK ASLEEP SO TO THEXTENT THT YOU CAN REFRAIN FROM DOING THAT AND CERTAINLY DON'T GET ON YOUR PHONE AND START SCROLLING SO FROMMEDIA UM TRY AND ASTYARE TRY THEIR EVERY AP TRY YOGANEDRA TRY SOME LONG EXAIL BREATHING ALL THOSE PROTOCALS BY THE WAY INCLUDE LONG EXO BREATHING AND IF YOU'RE TAKING MELATONEAN BEFORE SLEEP OFTEN TIMES YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP VERY READILY AND THEN WAKE UP SO IF YOUR TIGAMILL TONY YOU MIGHT WANT A RE CONSIDER THAT MELITONAN DOES HAVE ITS PLACE FOR TREATMENT OF JET LAG AN THINGS OF THAT SORT IN THE ACUTE SITUATIONS AND NOT TAKING IT TOO OFTEN BUT IN GENERAL DOSAGES ARE TOO HIG PEOPLE TAKE TOO MUCH OF IT AND TOO OFTEN IN MY OPINION BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION AND THEN I WOULD SAY IF YOU WAKE UP IN THEM ON MIDDLE THE NIGHT AND YOU SIMPLY CANNOT FALL BACK ASLEEP JUST REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN SURVIVE ONE NIGHT WITH MINIMAL OR NO SLEEP UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE ALL HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT IT STARTS BECOMING A CHRONIC CONDITION THEN YOU MAY WANT TO TALK TO A SLEEP SPECIALIST BUT WE'VE DONE MULTIPLE EPISODES IF HUBERIN LABPOD CAST THE MASTYER SLEEP PERFECT YOUR SLEEP E HAVE A SLEEP NEWS LETTER THAT YOU SHOULD DEFFLING DOWNLOAD ITS ZERO COST AGAIN HUVER IN LABDACCOM NEWS LETTER GO TO MENU NEWS LETTER ANU CAN FIND THAT FOR THOSE HAOE THE SUBSCRIBED TO THE PREMIUM CHANTELON GESSING THE YEARE OF IT AWARE OF THESE AM VARIOUS TOOLS BUT ONE THING WE KNOW FROM THE SLEEP LABIT STAMFORD IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THEIR NEXT DAY SOMETIMES THEY WAKE UP AND THAT THEIR SLEEP ACTUALLY CAN BE LESS THAN NORMAL AN THEY CAN FUNCTION WELL THE NEXT DAY IN FACT THERE BEEN TWO STUDIES AT LEAST THAT I'M AWARE OF TWO STUDIES THERE MAY BE MORE SHOWING THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE GIVEN UM QUOTINQ POOR SLEEP SCORE THEIR COGNANT PERFORMANCE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IS DIMINISHED EVEN IF THEY SLEPT REALLY LONG AND REALLY WELL SO THEY'VE BLIED TO THEM IN THESE STUDIES CONVERSELY IF PEOPLE HAVEN'T SLEPT THAT MUCH AND THEY WRESLEEP RECEIVE A GREAT SLEEP SORE THEY PERFORM REALLY WELL SO THESE SLEEP SCORES WHILE I LIKE THEM I LOOK IT MY EAT SLEEP SLEEP SCORE OR WHOOP SLEEP SCORE SOME PEOPLE US OR A RING SOMETHINGS THAT SORT YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO DRIVE YOUR PERCEPTION OF HOW AVAILABLE YOU ARE FOR HARD WORK AND COGNA FUNCTION SO Y I TEND TO RELI LARGELY ON SUBJECTIVE MEASURERS UNLESS YOU WERE TELING ABOUT THINGS LIKE API BE OR COLLESTERAL LEVELS YOUN SUBJECTIVELY A GUESSING WHAT GRATE WILL BE LEVEL AS IT IS NOT A GOOD APPROACH RIGHT ER RESTING HEART REIGHT THEYRE REAL METRICS BUT YOEU ONLY BE CAREFUL ABOUT RELYING TOO HEAVILY ON AM BOW METRICS GLEAN FROM DIVICES EVEN IF THYRE ACCURATE DON'T PUT TOO MUCH WEIGHT INTO TAKE THE AVERAGE SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING LATELY IF YOUR SLEEPSCORE'S DROPPING EACH DAY BY FIFTEEN TWENTY POINTS WELL THEN PAY ATTENTION TO THAT OR YOUR HART RAITES GOING OP ORS GOING DOWN YOU KNOW AVERAGES AVERAGES AVERAGES YOU KNOW AND SO BE A SCIENTIST OF YOURSELF COACH RUBY WRITES WHAT'S THE BEST PROTOCALL FOR STRAIN TRAINING WITHOUT HYPERTROPHY FOR WOMEN GREAT QUESTION WHEN I'VE LIFTED HEAVY WAITS AT IN TO BULK UP FAST OKE WANT TO EMBRACE MORE RESISTANCE TRAIN WITHOUT THE BULT GREAT QUESTION SO HERE'S THE INTERESTING ME ABOUT WAIT TRAINING IT'S KIND O COOL YOU WILL NEVER GET LARGER THEN THE SO CALLED PUMP THAT YOU ACHIEVE IN A SINGLE WORK OUT WHAT OIN ME BY THAT WELL LOT OF PEOPLE AND WOMEN IN PARTICULAR ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING QUOTECO TOO BIG TOO BULKY AND INDEED SOME WOMEN SOME MEN REACT VERY QUICKLY TO WAIT TRAINING THEY HAVE HIGH FIBR DENSITY AND FOR WHATEVER REASON OM COULD BE HORM HORMONS BUT IT PROBABLY ALSO HAS TO DO WITH UM DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROCINES THAT ARE EXPRESSED IN THE MUSCLES AND EVEN THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES SOME PEOPLE JES GROW QUOTIQUOT FASTER FROM WAIT TRAINING BUT I WILL ELL YOU THIS NO ONE'S EVER LOOKED IT AWAIT OR PICKED UP AWAIT DONE A SET AND THEN I PERTRAPED SO MUCH THAT IT WAS PERMANENT RIGHT THE THE SO CALL PUMP THE BLOODFLOW THAT YOU GET INTO A MUSCLE GIVES YOU A LITTLE WINDOW INTO WHAT THAT MUSCLE MIGHT LOOK LIKE IF YOU FEED IT AND REST IT PROPERLY SO CAN RECOVER AND HYPERTROPHY SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD AVOID THE SO CALL PUMP THE BLOOD FLOW INTO THE MUSCLE NOW WHATD WE KNOW FROM GOT SH BECAUSE TO BE FORTY YEARS OF A PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA AND ROBABLY HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF A JUST OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY DATA THAT VERY HEAVY WEIGHTS IN THE RANGE OF ONE TO THREE REPETITIONS GENERALLY MAKE PEOPLE STRONGER BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH HYPERTROPHY WHEN YOU GET FROM THREE TO FIVE REPETITIONS YOU'RE STILL IN THE MOSTLY STRENGTH SOME HYPERTROPHY RANGE WHEN YOU GET OUT TOWARDS SIX REPETITIONS OUT EVEN THIRTY REPETITIONS PROVIDE THE SETS ARE GOING TO FAILURE YOU CAN'T PERFORM ANOTHER REPETITION IN GOOD FORM WILL THEN YOU'RE STIMULATING HYPEROTROPHY NOW THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS IF YOU DO FOR INSTANCE A ONE  REPETITIONS SET WITH A WEIGHT BUT THAT WEIGHT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT SET OVER THE COURSE OF SEVENTY FIVE SECONDS THAT'S A LOT OF TIME UNDERTENTION AN YOU CAN GET HYPERTROPHY IN ADDITION TO THAT WEIGHT TRAINING THT NVOLVES IN SENSUATION OF THE NEGATIVE THE E CENTRIC THE LOWERING PORTION OF EACH REPETITION ALSO A STIMULATE HYPERTROPHY BUT ALSO STRENGTH GAINS SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO STRAIN TRAIN AND STRAIN TRAINING AS OH SO IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR MUSCLES BUT FOR NORAL FUNCTION IN THE BRAIN AND ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY THEN YOU REALLY DON'T WAT TO PUT ON ANY SIZE WHATSOEVER I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE PROTO CALLS THE DOCTRINE Y GALPAN AND I DISCUSSED ON THE EXERCISE SERIES THAT WE DID WITH DOCTOR GALPING TOT WUD BE LARGELY TRAINING A AFTER A WARM UP OF COURSE IN THE ONE TO THREE REPETITION RANGE AND EVEN SOME TRAINING THAT'S DONE STRICTLY FOR POWER MOVING THE WEGHT QUICKLY AT LOADS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LIGHTER ALTHOUGH FOR SOME PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE THE'RE GENETIC MAKE UP THEY ARE GOING TO REACT WITH HYPERTROPHY OF THAT KIND OF TRAINING SO I WOULD SAY IF YOU WANT A WEIGHT TRAIN WHICH IS A GREAT IDEA AND YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ON SIZE BE WANT O GET STRONGER TRAINING THAT ONE TO THREE REPETITION RANGE NOW THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN ONE REPETITION MAXIMUMS YOU EKING OU THE ABSOLUTE LAST WEWANT SINGLE REP THAT YOU CAN'T WIT THE MOST AMOUNT OF WEIGHT MAYBOU BACK OFF ON YOUR SINGLE REPETITION MAXIM YOU STILL JUST DOING ONE REPETITION BUT COURSE YOU WANT THAT REPETITION TO BE OF ANY VALUE IN IN INDUCING STRENGTHAN YOU SHOULD BE GETTING CLOSE YOUR ONE REPETITION MAX BUT A KEEP IN MIND ALSO THAT IF YOU'RE DOING THREE REPETITIONS HEAVY WEIGHTS BUT YOUR ONLY RESTING YOUN'T THIRTY TO YON HEHUNDRED TWENTY MENS BETWEN SETS WELL THEN YOU CAN GET A KIND OF COMPOUNDING A FACT WHERE YOU CAN INDUCE HYPERTROPHY SO IF YOU REACT THAT WELL YOU A AND BY THE WAY A MANY PEOPLE DO OR THERE ARE SOME EXCUSE ME MANY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT  SOME PEOPLE DO TO LOW REPETITIONS THAN YOU MAY HAVE TO INCREASE THE WEIGHT IND LOVER THE REPETITIONS EVEN FURTHER LONG REST JUST MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE OING THAT KIND OF TRAINING IF YOU'R CONCERNED WITH OVER ALL HEALTH AND NOT JUST POWER LIFTING ARE BEING REALLY REALLY STRONG THAT YOU'RE ALSO DOING SOME CARTY OF ASCULARTRAINING WHICH INCLUDES YOU DON'T WALKING PLENTY IN THE SORTS OF CARDIO THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER STEVE SAIDS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THESE FULL BODY SCAN AND MORIZE THT ARE BECOMING QUITE POPULAR DO YOU THINK THESE ARE BENEFICIAL OR THE UNNECESSARY UMWHY GOT ON UM AND I PAID FOR IT I DIDN'T GET IT COMPT OR ANYTHING AND I MUST SAY I LEARNED A LOT UM FORTUNATELY I LEARND I DON'T ANY TUMORS AT LEAST NOT OF THE SIZE THAT CULD BE DETECTED BY THAT EMARI I ALSO LEARN THAT I HAVE A DISCBULGE THAT EXPLAINS A LOT OF TIMES TON MY LIFE FOR IT DO A CERTAIN MOVEMENT THERE'S ONE OR TWO MOVEMENTS THAT I DO IN THE GIM WE'RE RUNNING AT CERTAIN STRIDE WERE THAT THING GOES AND CONFIRM THAT UMSI MENSION A I'VE EN VERY GRATEFUL THAT HI ONLY HAD ONE WHITE SPOT ON MY BRIN THE WHITE SPOTS ARE CONSIDERED NATURALLY OCCURRING TYPICALLY UM LESIONS OF THE OF NUROMS UM EVERYONE HAS ES I YOU'RE ALLOWED ONE PERDECADE OF LIFE BEFORE THEY STARTH ON CONSIDER A POTENTIAL PROBLEM I THNK HAVE THAT RIGHT UM S NOT WHOLE HOH YOU CAN DO FOR THOSE BY THE WAY EXCEPT DON'T GET ANY MORE HEADHIADS IF YOU'RE DOING A CONTACT SPORK OR CONSTRUCTION OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN YOU NOW BUT SOME PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND IF THAT'S THEIR WORK TH HAFE TO WORK SO YET I THINK IT WAS IT WAS INFORMATIVE FOR ME UM I WATCH A NAT FLICTS MOVING THERE WAS PRECO UM THE MOVE IT WASN VERY GOOD BUT IT WAS COOLYO CAN WATCH AN ATFLICTS IN THERE ANDS PRETTY EASY TO DO THEY'RE NOT CHEAP A COUPLE O THOUSAND DOLLARS MINIMUM UM IT WAS REASSURING TO ME TO NOT SEE ANY AND TUMORS ON MY LIVER TO MERS ON MA KIDNEY NOCOM WOOD O YOU KNOW I I MEAN IT UM AND TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF INTERVISOR FAT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I MAD I I DOUBT ON THE HALTHIEST SPECIMEN THAT ROLLD AS EVER ROLLE THROUGH THERE BUT IT WAS IT WAS REASSURING TO ME THAT I WAS 'T DEALING WITH A BUNCH OF WHITE SPOTS ON THE BRAIN WASN'T DEALING WITH THAT SORT OF THING AND YOU NOW IS IT NECESSARY NO NO IT'S NOT ALSO SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE HOOD IS IT UNNECESSARY IS WHAT YOU ASKED THAT'S A TRICKY ONE I MAY REALLY DEPENDS ON FINANCES AND HOW CURIOUS YOU ARE I WILL SAY THIS MY GOOD FRIEND AND FORMER GUEST ON THE OURIN LAPOTCAS DOCTOR ADYCHANG WHO'S A MEDICAL DOCTRINE CHAR OF NOR A SURGERY AT UNIVERSILY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I TOLD ASKED HIM ABOUT IT AN I TOLD HM I GOT ONE HE SAID OH YET WE GET PEOPLE COMING IN ALL THE TIME PATIENTE ALL THE TIME WHO'VE GOT THESE WHOLE BODY SCANS FOR RECREATIONAL PERVOSES OR BECAUSE THEY WERE CURIOUS AND THEY WILL IDENTIFY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED WITH NARROW SURGERY NOW THAT  SPLITS MY ANSWER IN TWO BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF SCARY RIGHT THAT COULD THERE WO BE WALKING ROUND WITH TUMORS ON THE BRAIN AND NOT EVEN KNOW IT Y ABSOLUTELY FOR LOT TUMORS OR BENIN A LOT TUMORS DON'T IMPINGE ON ARRAS OF THE BRAIN OR BODY THAT CREATE PROBLEMS AND NEVER CREATE PROBLEMS AND OTHERS THREE PROBLEMS AND UM DO YOU WANT TO KNOWD YOU WANT IT GET THAT TUMERIC SIZE THEIR LOT OF NON IN VASIVE WAYS TO DEAL WITH TUMORS NOWADAYS UM I GUESS IS A QUESTION WHETHER NOT YOU WANT TO KNOW AND WHEN I SAY WANT TO KNOW I'MAN OBVIOUSY EVERYONEWOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH UNDER THE HOOD BUT D YOU ARE YOU PREPARED FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND MEDICALLY IN WHAT YOU OULD AVE TO DO IN ORDER TO REMOVING ISSUE THAT MAYBE NOT AN ISSUE RIGHT AM IT'S POSSIBLE THAT Y OV A YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A GROWTH OR A MASS THAT S BENIN BUT YN THEN Y OF THE ANXIETY OF THE PERIOD IN BETWEEN SO S TRICKY IM SOME TISSUES LIKE PROSTATE TISSUES OR IM DIFFERENT TISSUES IN THE A FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACK CAN BE ENLARGE BUT NOT BE PROBLEMATIC BUT THEN PEOPLE MIGKT ONT TO MAKE CHANGES THAT TO AN SURE THAT THE ENLARGEMENT DOESN'T CONTINUE I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN DATA I LIKE DATA SO WHILE I'M NOT BING ON TRACKING MY SLEEP EVERY NIGHT I DO TRACK ET AT NIGHT BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY PUT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL NIGHTS SLEEP SCORE AM AND BY THE WAY IF YOU GET A REALLY LOUSY LOUSY SLEEPS SCORCHANS ARE YOU KNOW YOU SLET POORLY OGETS GREAT SLEEPSCORCHANCES ARE YOU KNOW YOU SLEPTD WELL AM S THE STUFFING BETWEEN THAT THAT KIND OF GETS PEOPLE INTERESTED AM I DON'T KNOW I I THINK FOR ME I I WAS HAPPY TO GET THE BILL OF HEALTH I DID AND HAD I A DISCOVERED SOMETHING THAT NEEDED DEALING WITH IKE GESS I'D BE GRATFUL THAT I WENT IN FOR IT AM SO THAT'S MY ANSWER BUT AGAIN THEIR EXPENSIVE I HOPE THE COST COMES DOWN I HOPE INSURANCE WILL COVER THESE EVENTUALLY WORKILA VISTA WHAT A GREAT NAME OR KILLAVISTA ALSO AM ASKS WOULD YOU AS A DOG LOVER CONSIDERING DOING AN EPISODE ON DOG WELLNESS AN COMMUNICATION YES YES ABSOLUTEY I LOVE DOGS O DOG SO MUCH IT'S RIDICULOUS I JUST DO I JIS A I LIKE BEENG AROUND EM I LIE THINKING AMADAM I CAME OU WITH THEM AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS RIGHT COSTELLE WAS A FAMILY MEMBER AND I AM I'M EAGERLY ANTICIPATING GETTING ANOTHER DOG PROBABLY WHEN WE GET BACK FROM TOUR IN AUSTRALIA FROM AUSTRALIA AM I'M NOT CAN BRING BACK AN AUSTRALIAN SHEPERD THEY HAVE LIKE WEIG TO MUCH ENERGY FOR ME I LIKE THE MELLO DOGS I LIKE ECONOMY OF EFFORT IN A DOG WHITH US WHY A BULLDOGER A MASTIFF AS PROBLY GOOD ONE FOR ME YES YES AND YES PAT HEALTH IS KEY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PATS AR KEY DON'T GET DOG THEY CAN'T TAKE GREAT CARE OF IN BULLDOGS ARE A TON O WORK AND THEIR VERY EXPENSIVE PLAN ON SPENDING AT LEAST I'M NOT KETTING TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLERS O YOUR MEDICAL BILLS ON A DOG TO KEEP A BULLDOG KEEP IM HEALTHY ADOPT IF YOU CAN LO DOGS OUT THEIR NEED NEED BE ADOPTED HIDI M SAYS I NEED ADVISE SOME THIRTY TWO I'M WORKING OUT FOR TWO THREE YEARS BUT MY LEFT ARM IS WEAKER THAN MY RIGHT HOW DO I BALANCE MUSCLE STRENGTH BETWEEN SIZES DIFFERENT WEIGHTS OR STRAGE GREAT QUESTION WELL I GUESS YOU SUMING THIT'S A LOT WEAKER I MEAN I AM A BIG BELIEVER IN DOING YOU KNOW LATERA MOVEMENTS I CAN'T REMEMBER LAST TIME INTO BARBELL CURL OR WERE A ERE A YOU KNOW THE THE T THING THEY ALL THE EASY BAR TRIS UP EXTENSION I AL MUST ALWAYS DO UNALATERAL STUFF DONBELL CURLS I THINK THE REAL KEY IF YOU WANT A WEAKER ARM OR LIMB TO GET STRONGER IS THAT MINE MUSCLE CONNECTION YOU KNOW I MEANS PRESUMABLY UNLESS THERE'S SOME SORT OF UNDER LYING NEAR LOGIC THING AND I DO'T WANT A SCARE YOU IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE BUT SEEMS UNLIKELY BASE ON THE WAY WORE THE QUESTION IS THAT YOU ONE MAY SURE GRIPPING THE HANDLE THE WEIGHT REALLY TIGHTLY BY THEWAY THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR STRENGTH IN PERFORMANCE ON A SET TO GRIP TIGHTLY THERE'S NORRAL REASONS FOR THAT AND THAT YOU'RE REALLY WORKING HARD TO CONTRACT THE MUSCLE AND ALSO USE WEIGHTS THAT YOU CAN CONTROL REMEMBER WHEN YOU LIFT WEIGHTS FOR SAKE OF GETTING STRONGER T'S NOT ABOUT LIFTING WEIGHTS YOUR AC HUAL USING THE WEIGHT AS A TOOL TO STIMULATE STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY INCREASES SO IT'S A TOOL AND YOU DON'T WALK AROUND WITH THE WEIGHT NUMBER ON YOUR BODY YOU WALK AROUND WITH THE MUSCLE DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU ACHIEVED AND THE STRANGT THAT YOU ACHIEVED WITH A PARTICULAR WEIGHT AND NO ONE CARES WITH THAT WEIGHT IS SO IF YOU YOU KNOW I YOU CAN'T CARRY TWO BAGS OR GROCERIES UP THE STAIRS UM IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU WERE ABLE TO YOU KNOW CARRY FOUR HUNDRED POUND DUMBILLS THROUGH THE GIM RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHY I THINK THE READINESS THING IS KEY I THING WE THINK SO MUCH ABOUT THE JIM AS TAT AS THE IND POINT BUT THE JIM IS A PLACE FOR TRAINING FOR THE REST OF LIFE IN MY OPINION TELSE HAVEN TO BE FOND FOR ME BUT UM IF YOUR LEFT ARM IS WEAKER I WOULD EMPHASIZE WELL YOU COULD PERHAPS DO MORE SETS CERTAINLY I WOULD DO YOU COULD DO ALL YOUR LEFT ARM SETS FIRST THAN YOUR RIGHT ARM SETS IF IT'S REALLY SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT YOU MAY ACTUALLY WANT A STOP TRAINING THE RIGHT SIDE AS INTENSELY FOR OF PERIOD OF TIME TO GET THAT LEFT ARM UP THERE A THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I LIKE YOU THE LATERAL A WORK I DON'T DO ALLOW TO OUN A LATERAL WORK FOR MY LEGS WE THINK I DO LEG CURLS NOUT THAT'S BOTH LIKE SAME TIME I DOESN'T TRY ING PULL WITH BOTH LIKE SAME TIME LEG EXTENSION SAME TIME A HAXQUAT SAME TIME GLUTEHEMORY SAME TE O E YET UM JUST KEEP TRAINING IT BUT DON'T OVER TRAIN IT IF IT'S REALLY WEAK BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING IT TWENTY FIVE SETS MAY SURE YOUR ALLOWING TIME FOR IT TO RECOVER AND BY THE WAY I DON'T KNOW UM A HOW I CAP DON'T RECALX THE QUESTIONS GONE NOW HOW OLD AT YOUR BUT YOU GIVE YOUR BODY TIME GIVE YOUR RY TOMAS OUR TRAINING ONE AF SIXTEEN GIVE YOUR BODY TIME IT IT TAKES TIME TO TRAIN CORRECTLY AND IT TAKES TIME TO DEVELOP A STRONG MIND MUSCLE CONNECTION AND YOU DON'T DON'T RUSH DON'T RUN OUT THERE AN START USING YOU KNOW IDON'T GET CAVALIER WITH FORMA SUITACLES OR ANYTHING ELSE JUST TAKE YOUR TIME ENJOY YOUR TRAINING THE BEST ADVICE I EV OR GOT ABOUT TRAINING AM WAT SOMEREADY VERY ACCOMPLISHIN HE SAID AND I REALLY INTERNALIZE SOS I LEARN TO  AND YOU MAY TOE LEAD THE LEARN TO LEARN TO ENJOY TRAINING REALLY HARD OR JUST LOVE TRAINING HARD I LOVE TRAINING HARD I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT SO JUST LEARN THAT LI LEAN INTO THAT PROCESS AND ENJOY IT AND IF YOU AND IF THERE CERAN PARTS THAT OARE CHALLENGING REMEMBER YOUR INCREASING THE SIZE F THAT MEDIAL I ENTER MID SINGULAR QUARTUX LAST QUESTION REALLY I WAS WAT'S ON WEN WEAGES KEEP

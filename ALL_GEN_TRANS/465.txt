WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAPOGA  O SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  I MAY INDROUHUBERMAN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NEROBILOG AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER OR OS D WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER WHICH AS YOU WILL SOON LEARN IS DISTINCT FROM OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER IN FACT MANY PEOPLE THAT REFER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS AS OBSESSIVE OR COMPULSIVE OR GUTN  HAVING OS D OR OSE D ABOUT THIS OR OS D ABOUT THAT DO NOT HAVE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSIBLE OSE D RATHER MANY PEOPLEL HAVE OBSESSIVE COMPULSVE PERSONALITY DISORDER HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE ACTUAL OS D AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUFFERING IN FACT OSE D TURNS OUT TO BE NUMBER SEVEN ON THE LIST OF MOST DEBILITATING ILLNESSES NOT JUST PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESSES BUT OF ALL ILLNESSES WHICH IS REMARKABLE AND SOMEWHAT FRIGHTENING THE GOOD NEWS IS THANKS TO THE FIELDS OF PSYCHIETRY PSYCHOLOGY AND SIENCE IN GENERAL THERE ARE NOW EXCELLENT TREATMENTS FOR OSE D WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THOSE TREATMENTS TO DAY THOSE TREATMENTS RANGE FROM BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES TO DRUG THERAPIES AND BRAIN STIMULATION AND EVEN SOME OF THE MORE HOLISTIC OR NATURAL THERAPIES AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE THEY MAY WANT A PHOCIS MORE ON THE BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES WHEREAS FOR OTHERS MORE ON THE DRUG BASE THERAPIES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH ONE EXTREMELY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT THING I LEARN FROM THIS EPISODE IS THAT THE PARTICULAR SEQUENCE THAT BEHAVIORAL AND OUR DRUG AND OR HOLISTIC THERAPIES ARE APPLIED IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN FACT THE OUTCOMES OF STUDIES OFTEN DEPEND ON WHETHER NOT PEOPLE START ON DRUG TREATMENT AND THAN FOLLOW WITH COGNO BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT OR VICE VERSA WE'RE GOING TO GOING TO ALL THOSE DETAILS AND HOW THEY RELATE TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF OSE D BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE ANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS AND THE AGE OF ONSET FOR OSE D AND SO ON AND SO FORTH WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS BY THE END OF THIS EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE A MUCH GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OS D IS AN WHAT IT ISN'T AND WHAT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER IS IN WHAT IT IS NOT ND YOU WILL HAVE A RICH ARRAY OF DIFFERENT THERAPE OPTIONS TO EXPLOR IND YOURSELF OR IN OTHERS THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM OS D AND IF NEITHER YOU OR OTHERS THAT YOU KNOW SUFFER FROM OSE D OR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER THE INFORMATION COVERED IN TO DAY'S EPISODE WILL ALSO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO HOW THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM TRANSLATE THOUGHT INTO ACTION GENERALLY AND ALSO YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT GOL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR GENERALLY MY HOPE IS THAT BY THE END OF THE EPISODE YOU WILL BOTH UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT THIS DISEASED STATE THAT WE CALL OSE D YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DIRECT TREATMENTS TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS IN BETTER WAYS AND THAT YOU WILL GAIN GREATER INSIGHT INTO HOW YOU FUNCTION AND W HUMAN BEINGS FUNCTION IN GENERAL TH UBERMAN LADPODCAST IS PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT WEVE PARTNERED WITH MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS YOUE DONE THAT FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST OF ALL THE QUALITY OF THEIR SUPPLEMENTS IS

SLASH HUBERMENT AND YOU GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DO CAM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT OSE D OR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER FIRST OF ALL AS THE NAME SUGGESTS OSED INCLUDES THOUGHTS OR OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS WHICH ARE ACTIONS THE OBSESSIONS IN THE COMPULSIONS ARE OFTEN LINKED IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME THE OBSESSIONS IN THE COMPULSIONSOR LINKED SUCH THAT THE COMPULSION THE BEHAVIOR IS DESINE TO RELIEVE THE OBSESSION HOWEVER ONE OF THE HALL MARKED THEMES OF OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER IS THAT THE OBSESSIONS ARE INTRUSIVE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEM THEY DON'T ENJOY HAVING THEM THEY JUST SEEM TO POP INTO PEOPLE'S MINES AND THEY SEEM TO POP INTO THEIR MIND RECURRENTLY AND THE COMPULSIONS UNLIKE OTHER SORTS OF BEHAVIORS PROVIDE BRIEF RELIEF TO THE OBSESSION BUT THEN VERY QUICKLY REENFORCE OR STRENGTHEN THE OBSESSION THIS IS A VERY KEY THEME TO REALIZE ABOUT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER SOMJUS CAN REPEAT IT AGAIN THESE TWO FEATURES FIRST THE FACT THAT THE OBSESSIONS ARE INTRUSIVE AND RECURRENT AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THE COMPULSIONS THE BEHAVIORS PROVIDE IF ANYTHING ONLY BRIEF RELIEF FOR THE OBSESSIONS BUT IN MOST CASES SIMPLY SERVE TO MAKE THE BSESSION STRONGER ARE THE HALL MARK FEATURES OF OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER IN TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THESE IN MIND AS WE GO FORWARD NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY DEFINE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER BUT THEY ALSO DEFINE THE SORTS OF TREATMENTS THAT WILL AND WILL NOT WORK FOR OBSESSIVE COPULSIVE DISORDER AND THEN ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND A LITTE ABOUT THE NORAL CIRCUITRY UNDERLYING OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MOMENTS THEN YOU WILL CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHY BEING A QUOT AN COT OBSESSIVE PERSON OR HAVING OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY IS NOT THE SAME AS OSEED IN FACT WE CAN LEAP AHEAD A LITTLE BIT AND COMPARE AN CONTRAST O SE D WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER ALONG ONE VERY PARTICULAR SET OF FEATURES CAND I'LL GO INTO THIS AND MORE T TILL LATER BUT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT OSE D IS CHARACTERIZED BY THESE RECURRENT AND INTRUSIVE OBSESSIONS AND AS I MENTION BEFORE THE FACT THAT THE SOBSESSIONS GET STRONGER AS A FUNCTION OF PEOPLE PERFORMING CERTAIN BEHAVIORS SO UNLIKE AN ITCH THAT YOU FEEL AN THEN YOU SCRATCH IT AN IT FEELS BETTER OSED IS MORE LIKE AN ITCH THAT YOU FEEL YOU SCRATCH IT AND THE ITCH INTENSIFIES THAT CONTOUR OR THAT PATTERN OF BEHAVIORS AND THOUGHTS INTERACTING IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER WHICH MAINLY INVOLVES A SENSE OF DELAYED GRATIFICATION THAT PEOPLE WANT AND SOMEWHAT ENJOY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THEM TO FUNCTION BETTER OR MORE IN LINE WITH HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO SHOW UP IN THE WORLD SO AGAIN OSEE D HAS MAINLY TO DO WITH OSESSIONS THAT ARE INTRUSIVE AND RECURRENT WHEREAS OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER DOES NOT HAVE THAT INTRUSIVE FEATURE TO IT PEOPLE DO NOT MIND OR IN FACT OFTEN INVITE OR LIKE THE PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF THOUGHT THAT LEAD THEM TO BE COMPULSIVE ALONG CERTAIN DIMENSIONS SO LEAVING ASIDE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER FOR THE MOMENT LET'S FOCUS A BIT MORE ON O SE D AND TOFIND HOW IT TENDS TO SHOW UP IN THE WORLD FIRST OF ALL OSEE D IS EXTREMELY COMMON IN FACT CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT ANYWHERE FROM TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT TO AS HIGH AS THREE OR EVEN FOUR PER CENT OF PEOPLE SUFFER FROM TRUE OSE D THAT IS AN ASTONISHINGLY HIGH NUMBER NOW THE REASON THE RANGEIS SO BIG TO POINT FIVE PERCENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THREE OR MAYBEVEN FOUR PER CENT IS THAT A LOT OF THE FEATURES OF O SE D GO UNNOTICED BOTH IN THE CLINITIONS OFFICE ND SIMPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REPORT IT AND DON'T TALK ABOUT IT IN FACT IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE RECURRENT AND INTRUSIVE OBSESSIONS AND NOT ENGAGE IN THE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS THAT WOULD EVER ALLOW PEOPLE TO NOTICE THAT SOMEBODY HAS OSE D THAT CAN BE BECAUSE SOME OF THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS DON'T ACTUALLY LEAD TO OVERT BEHAVIORS LIKE HANDWASHING OR CHECKING THAT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD NOTICE IT CAN ALSO BE BECAUSE PEOPLE LEARN TO DISGUISE OR HIDE THEIR OBSESSIONS AND THEIR COMPULSIONS OUT OF SHAME OR FEAR OF LOOKING STRANGE OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE SUCH THAT THEY HAVE THESE OBSESSIVE INDINTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND THEY DO LITTLE MICRO BEHAVIORS LIKE THEY MIGHT TAP THEIR FINGERS ON THEIR FLY AS A WAY TO AVOID AT LEAST IN THEIR OWN MIND SOMETHING CATESTROPHIC HAPPENING THAT MIGHT SEEM CRAZY TO YOU THT MIGHT SEEM BIZARE BUT THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT OPERATES IN A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS BECAUSE THE CLINICAL LITERATURE THAT ARE OUT THERE REALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE OSE D FULL BLOWN OSE D AND NEVER REPORT IT BECAUSE OF THE COSHAME AND HIDING ASSOCIATED WITH IT ANOTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT OSE D IS EXTREMELY DEBILITATING I MENTION THIS A FEW MINUTES AGO BUT OSEEDIS CURRENTLY LISTED AS IN NUMBER SEVEN IN TERMS OF THE MOST DEBILITATING ILLNESS IS NOT JUST MENTAL ILLNESSES OR DISORDERS BUT ALL TYPES OF ILLNESSES INCLUDING THINGS LIKE ASMIN CANSER ET CETERA SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH THAT STANDING AT NUMBERR CEVEN THAT IT IS BOTH EXTREMELY COMMON END EXTREMELY DEBILITATING AND AS A CONSEQUENCE IT'S NOW REALIZED THAT MANY HOURS DAYS WEAKS MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS OF WORK PERFORMANCE OR SHOWING UP AT WORK OF RELATIONAL INTERACTIONS REALLY SUFFER AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PEOPLE HAVING OSED SO THIS IS A VITAL PROBLEM THAT THE SCIENTIFIC AND PSYCHEATRIC IN PSYCHOLOGICAL COMMUNIES UNDERSTAND AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'M DOING THIS PODCAST AND OF COURSE I RESIVE THE TON OF INTEREST IN N OSE D BECAUSE OF THIS INCREDIBLY HIGH INCIDENTS OF OSE D AND HOW DABILITATING IT IS WE COULD GO REALLY DEEP INTO WY IT'S SO DEBILITATING I DO'T ONT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK MOST OF THAT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS BUT SOME OF IT IS NOT FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES OSE D SO DEBILITATING IS OF COURSE THE SHAME THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE BUT IT'S ALSO THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE FOCUSSING ON THEIR OBSESSIONS IN THEIR COMPULSIONS THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS THAT'S SIMPLY THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN WORKS WERE NOT ABLE TO FOCUS ON TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE THE OTHER THING IS THAT OSEE D TAKES A LOT OF TIME OUT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES WITH RECURRENT INTRUCIVE THOUGHTS HAPPENING AT VERY HIGH FREQUEN SEE OR EVEN AT MODERATE FREQUENCY PEOPLE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS STUFF AND THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THE BEHAVIORS THEY NEED DOINGAGE IN AND THEN ENGAGING IN THE BEHAVIORS WHICH AS I MENTION BEFORE JUST SERVE TO STRENGTH IN THE COMPULSIONS AND SO THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY DOING THE OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE US FUNCTIONAL HUMAN BEINGS LIKE COMMUTING TO WORK OR DOING HOME WORK ARE DOING WORK OR LISTENING WHEN PEOPLE ARE TALKING OR INTERACTING OR SPORTS ARE WORKING ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE FOR A RICH QUALITY LIFE AR TAKIN OVER BY OSE D IN MANY CASES SO WELL THAT MIGHT BE OBVIOUS TO SOME I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S OBVIOUS TO EVERYBODY JUST HOW MUCH TIME OSEE D CAN OCCUPY ANOTHER THING YOU'LL SOON LEARN IS THAT SADLY A LOT OF THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS IN OSE D OFTEN RELATE TO TABOO TOPICS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE GENERAL CATEGORIES OF OSE D FALL IN TO THREE DIFFERENT BENS CHECKING OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS REPETITION OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS AN ORDER BSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS THE CHECKING ONES ARE SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS CHECKING THE STOVE OR CHECKING THE LOCKS WHICH I THINK WE ALL TEND TO DO I'M SOMEBODY TYPICALLY OUT AND OFF TO THE CARD A YOU COMMUTE TO WORK NOTHING LOCK THE FRONT DOOR AND 'LL GO BACK ONCE BUT I WON'T GO BACK TWICE OR FIFTY TIMES PEOPLE WITH OSE D WILL OFFAND GO BACK TWENTY OR THIRTY TIMES BEFORE THEY'LL ACTUALLY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO DRIVE OFF AND THEN ITS A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE OFF AND DISCARD WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY DIDN'T CHECK THE STOVER THEY DIDN'T CHECK THE LOCKS OR THEY DIDN'T CHECK SOMETHING ELSE CRITICAL REPETITION OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS OBVIOUSLY CAN DOVE TAIL WITH THE THE CHECKING ONES BUT THOSE TEN TO BE THINGS LIKE COUNTING OFF OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NUMBERS LIKE WHONE TO BEFORFIVES IC SEVEN SEVEN SIX FIVE OR THREE TO ONE PEOPLE PERFORM THAT REPEATEDLY REPEATEDLY REPEATEDLY OR FEEL THAT THEY HAVE TO REMEMBER YEARS AGO WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE BAND THE ROMONS I MOST BE RE HARD OF TH REMONS RIGHT GENES TSHERTS AVIATOR LASSES EVERY ONE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR LAST NAME TO REMON THEY WAREN'T ACTUALLY ALL RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER BY THE WAY YET TO CHANGE YOUR LAST NAME TOEUREMON THE REMONS HAD ONE BAND MEMBER WHO WAS ADMITTEDLY AND KNOWN TO OTHERS AS HAVING OSE D AND DURING THAT DOCUMENTARY WHICH I FORGET THE NAME THINK IT IS CALLED CAN'T REMEMBER ANYWAY CAN'T REMEMBER A HYPPOCAMPL LAPS THERE BUT IN THIS DOCUMENTARY THE BAND MEMBERS DESCRIBE JOY REMON AS LEAVING HOTELS WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS TO THE PARKING LOT BUT THEN HAVING TO WALK UP AND DOWN THEM SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES AND SOMETIMES GETTING OUT OF THE VAN AGAIN AND WALKING UP DOWN THEM SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TIMES GIVEN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STAIRS THIS APPEARS QUOTINQU CRAZY BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT TO THINK OF THIS AS CRAZY THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO VERY LIKELY HAD FULL BLOWN OSEED NOW THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE BELIEVE IT ORE NOT IS NOT ALL THAT UNCOMMON IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THAT EXAMPLE ENTAILED CERTAIN COMPULSIONS AND BEHAVIORS THAT WERE OVERT AND THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD SEE AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THAT WOULD PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM MOVING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIFE EASILY A LOT OF PEOPLE AS I MENTION BEFORE HAVE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS THAT THEY HIDE AN THEY DO THESE LITTLE MICRO BEHAVIORS OR THEY'RE JUST COUNT OFF IN THEIR HEAD AS OPPOSED TO GENERATING SOME SORT OF WALKING UP AND DOWNSTAIRS OR TAPPING OR THINGS OF THAT SORT SO WE HAVE CHECKING WE HAVE REPETITION AND THEN THERE'S ORDER ORDER OFTENTIMES IS THOUGHT OF AS PUTTING CLEANLINESS OR MAKING SURE EVERYTHING AS A LINED AND PERFECT IN ORDERLY AND OFTENTIMES THAT IS THE CASE BUT THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF ORDER THAT PEOPLE WITH OSED CAN FOCUS ON IN A OBSESSIVE AND COMPULSIVE WAY THINGS LIKE INCOMPLETENESS THE IDEA THAT ONE CAN'T WALK AWAY FROM SOMETHING OR STOP DOING SOMETHING BECAUSE SOMETHINGS NOT RIGHT OR COMPLETE IN THAT PICTURE IT COULD BE THE WAY THAT TABLE IS SET IT COULD BE THE WAY THAT SOMETHINGS WRITTEN ON A PAGE IT COULD BE IN EMALE GEN NOW WER STILL TALKING ABOUT OC D THE DISORDER WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISSORTER I'M AWARE OF WELL I'LL JUST BE DIRECT SEVERAL COLLEAGUES OF MINE AS JUST REMARKABLE THE ORDER IN THEIR EMALES EVERY EMALE IS PERFECT PUNCTUATED PERFECT GRAMMAR PERFECT EVERYTHING SPACE PERFECT ARE DO THEY HAVE OSED WHILE THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT NOT HOW WOULD I KNOW UNLESS THEY DISCLOSE THAT TO ME BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE OBSESS IVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY THE SORTER OR THEY JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO GENERATE A LOT OF ORDER AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF DISCIPLINE AROUND THE WAY THEY WRITE IN THE WAY THEY PRESENT ANY COMMUNICATION WITH ANYBODY AT ALL SO IF SOMEBODY HAS A OSE D THAT IN THE DOMAIN OF ORDER IT COULD BE INCOMPLETENESS AND THE CONSTANT FEELING OF SOMETHING NOT BEING COMPLETED AND A NEED TO COMPLETE IT IT CAN ALSO BE IN TERMS OF SYMMETRY THAT EVERYTHING BE A LINED IN SYMMETRIC IN SOME WAY THIS COULD BE A SEEN PERHAPS IN YOUNG KIDS THIS IS ONE EX AMPLE THAT I READ IN THE LITERATURE OF CHILDREN THAT NEED TO ARRANGED THEIR STUFFED ANIMALS IN EXACT SAME ORDER EVERY DAY AND IN A PARTICULAR ORDER A TO THE POINT WHERE IF YOU WERE TO MOVE THE LITTLE STUFFED FROG OVER NEXT TO THE STUFFED RABBIT THAT THE CHILD WOULD HAVE A AN ANXIETY REACTION TO THAT AND FEEL LITERALLY COMPELLED DRIVEN TO FIX THAT MAY BEVEN MULTIBLE TIMES OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE'LL TALK ABOUT OSED AND CHILDREN VERSES ADULTS IN A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THE OTHER ASPECT OF ORDER WHICH IS A LITLABIT LESS THAN INTUITIVE IS THIS NOTION OF DISGUST THIS IDEA THAT SOMETHING IS CONTAMINATED SO WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT OSED AND HANDWASHING BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO PEOPLE FEELING THAT SOMETHING IS CONTAMINATED A SPACE A TOWEL ET CETERA OR EVEN SIMPLETE SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAND IN SO THEIRE UNWILLING TO SHAKE SOMEBODY'S HAND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THESE DIFFERENT BINS OF OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS CHECKING REPETITION AND ORDER THE EXTREMELY DEBILITATING DEPENDING ON HOW SEVERE THEY ARE AND HOW MANY DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF LIFE THEY SHOW UP IN BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IN MOVIES AND EVEN THE WAY I'M DESCRIBING IT NOW IT SOUNDS AS IF OKE WELL SOMEBODY HAS TO CHECK THE LOCKS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ALSO CHECK THE STOVE OR SOMEBODY HAS THE NEED TO COUNT TO SEVEN BACK AND FORTH UP TO SEVEN AND DOWN TO SEVEN SEVEN TIMES SEVEN TIMES A DAY OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WHERE THEY NEED SYMMETRY IN VERY SPECIFIC DOMAINS OF LIFE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS RECURRENT AND INTRUSIVE ASPECT OF OBSESSIONS LEADS PEOPLE WITH O C D TO HAVE CHECKING REPETITION AND OR ORDER COMPULSIONS EVERYWHERE SO WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS AT WORK OR IN SCHOOL OR CHI NA NGAGE IN SPORT OR CHINENGAGE IN RELATIONSHIP OR JUST SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE WALKING DOWN THE STREET THE OBSESSIONS ARE SO INTRUSIVE THAT THEY SHOW UP AND THEY COMPEL PEOPLE TO DO THINGS IN THAT DOMAIN INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ONE LOCATION OR ANOTHER IN OTHER WORDS THE THOUGHT PATTERNS AND THE BEHAVIORS TAKE OVER THE ENVIRONMENT AS SUPPOSE THE ENVIRONMENT DRIVING THE THOUGHT PATTERNS AND BEHAVIORS SO IT THEREFORE BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER FIND A ROOM THAT'S CLEAN ENOUGH TO FIND A BED THAT'S MADE WELL ENOUGH TO FIND ANYTHING THAT'S DONE WELL ENOUGH TO REMOVE THE OBSESSION AND I KNOISE SAID IT MULTIPLE TIMES NOW WHEN I'M GOING TO SAY IT MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE IN A SOMEWHAT OBSESSIVE BUT A BELIEVE JUSTIFIED WAY THAT EVERY TIME THAT ONE ENGAGES IN THE COMPULSION RELATED TO THE OBSESSION THE OSESSIONS SIMPLY BECOMES STRONGER AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT A WHAT A POWERFUL AND DEBILITATING LOOP THAT REALLY IS SO LET'S DRILL A LITTLE BUT DEEPER IN TO HOW THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER IF WE WERE TO DRAW LINE BETWEEN THE OBSESSIONS IN THE COMPULSIONS THAT LINE COULD BE DESCRIBED AS ANXIETY NOW WE NEED TO DEFINE WHAT ANXIETY IS AND TO BE QUITE HONEST MOST OF PSYCHOLOGY AN SCIENCE CAN'T AGREE ON EXACTLY WHAT ANXIETY IS TYPICALLY THE WAY WE THIN  ABOUT FEAR IS THAT IT'S A HEIGHTENED STATE OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL SO INCREASE HEARTRATE INCREASE BREATHING SWEATING ET CETERA IN RESPONSE TO AN IMMEDIATE AND PRESENT THREAT OR PERCEIVED THREAT OR AS ANXIETY GENERALLY SPEAKING IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE RELATES TO THE SAME SORTS OF THOUGHT PATTERNS AND SOMATIC BODILY RESPONSES HEART RATE BREATHING ET CETERA BUT WITHOUT A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER BEING IN THE ENVIRONMENT OR RIGHT THERE SO THAT'S THE WAY THAT WERE GON TO TALK ABOUT ANXIETY NOW AND ANXIETY IS REALLY WHAT BINDS THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS SUCH THAT SOME ONE WILL HAVE AN INTRUSIVE THOUGHT SO FOR INSTANCE SOME ONE WILL HAVE THE THOUGHT THAT IF THEY TURN LEFT ON ANY STREET THAT SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN F THAT'S AN OBSESSION IS ASSING NOT ALL THAT UNCOMMON NOW HOW BAD AND WHAT THE SPECIFICITY OF THAT BAD THING REALLY IS WILL VARY SOMEPEOPLE WILL THINK IF I TURN LEFT SOMETHING GENERALLY BAD WILL HAPPEN IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL ANXIOUS SO THEY ALWAYS INSISTEN GOING RIGHT WHERE AS OTHER PEOPLE WIL THINK IF I TURN LEFT SO AND SO WILL DIE OR I WILL DIE OR SOMETHING TERRIBLE WILL HAPPEN I'LL GET A DISEASE OR SOME ONE ELSE WILL GET A DISEASE OR I'LL BE CURSING MYSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE IN SOME VERY SPECIFIC WAY THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY QUITE COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH OSED SO THEY HAVE THIS FEELING AND THE FEELING CAN BE GENERALLY OR SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO A PARTICULAR OUTCOME BUT BENEATH THAT IS A FEELING OF ANXIETY A QUICKENING OF THE HEART BEAT A QUICKENING OF BREATHING A NARROWING OF ONE'S VISUAL FOCUS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE ANOTHER PODCASTS THE MASTER STRESTS ANOTHER PODCASTS BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THOSE EN WE JUST BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THAT WHEN WE ARE IN A STATE OF INCREASED SO CALLED AUTONOMIC ERALSAL ALERTNESS STRESS ET CETERA OUR VISUAL FEEL LITERALLY NARROWS THE APERTURE OF OUR VISUAL FIELD GET SMALLER AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM SO YOU START SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH SORT OF SOTO STRAW VIEW OR THROUGH BONOCULAR LIKE VIEW AS OPPOSED TO SEEING THE BIG PICTURE WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT WELL IT LITERALLY SHARPENS AND NARROWS YOUR FOCUS TOWARD THE VERY THING THAT THE OBSESSION AND THE COMPULSIONS ARE FOCUSED ONS OF THE PERSON WALKING DOWN THE STREET WHO SEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO LEFT OR RIGHT WILL ONLY SEE THE BAD DECISION THER VISUAL FEEL NARROWS VERY TIGHTLY ALONG THAT POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A LEFT TURN AND I KNOW AS I DESCRIBE THE SEEMS TOLLY IRATIONAL BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE PERSON WITH OS SEETY KNOWS ITS IRRATIONAL THEY MIGHT FEEL CRAZY BECAUSE THEIR HAVING THESE THOUGHTS BUT THEY KNOW IT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER THAT LEFT SOMEHOW WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN RIGHT IN TERNS OF OUTCOMES IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND YET IT FEELS AS IF IT WOULD IN FACT IN SOME CASES IT FEELS AS IF THEY WENT LEFT THEY WOULD HAVE A FULL BLOWN PANIC ATTACK SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS ARE BOUND BY ANXIETY BUT THEN BY TAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN AGAIN IN THIS ONE PARTICULAR EXAMPLE BY TAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN THERE'S A VERY BRIEF I SHOULD MENTION VERY BRIEF RELIEF OF THAT ANXIETY AT THE TIME OF THE DECISION TO GO RIGHT NOT LEFT AND THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL DROP IN ANXIETY WHILE ONE TAKES THE RIGHT HAND TURN AS OPPOSED TO THE LEFT HAND TURN AND THEN AS I ILLUDED TO BEFOR THERE'S A REENFORCEMENT OF THE COMPULSION IN OTHER WORDS BY GOING RIGHT IT DOESN'T CREATE A SITUATION IN THE BRAIN AND PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PERSON THAT I YOUKNOWAT I'M NOT ANXIOUS ANY MORE LEFT WOULD PROBABLY BEEN O CAY IT REENFORCES THE IDEA THAT RIGHT MADE ME FEEL BETTER OR TURNING RIGHT MADE ME FEEL BETTER AND GOING LEFT WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT MUCH WORSE AGAIN IT REENFORCES THE OBSESSION EVEN FURTHER AND AGAIN WE COULD SWAP OUT RIGHT TURNS AND LEFT TURNS WITH SOMETHING LIKE HAND WASHING THE FEELING THAT SOMETHING IS CONTAMINATED AND THE NEED TO WASH ONE'S HANDS EVEN THOUGH ONE ALREADY WASH THEIR HANDS TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY TIMES PRIOR WHEREASHI GON TO GO BACK TO THAT EXAMPLE LITTLE BIT LATER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF THERAPIES THAT ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN MANY PEOPLE FOR OSED WHICH OW THE COGNIV BEHAVIOR AN EXPOSURE THERAPIES THINK SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF COGNI BEHAVIOUR OWN EXPOSURE THERAPIES BUT THE WAY THEY ARE USED TO TREAT OSED IS VERY MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY THEY ARE USED TO TREAT OTHER SORTS OF ANXIETY DISORDERS AND OTHER SORTS OF DISORDERS GENERALLY SO IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT UP TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE WITH OSED HAVE SOME SORT OF ANXIETY OR ELEVATED ANXIETY EITHER DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE OSED OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO THE OSED AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO TEASE THOSE APART BECAUSE OSED  CAN CREATE ITS OWN ANXIETY AS I MENTION BEFORE IT CAN EVEN INCREASE ITS OWN ANXIETY AND THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE OF DEPRESSION HAVING OED CAN BE VERY DEPRESSING SPECIALLY IF SOME OF THESE OSED THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS STARC A REALLY IMPED PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN LIFE AT WORK AND SCHOOLIN RELATIONSHIP THEY CAN START FEELING LESS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT LIFE AND IN FACT SOME PEOPLE CAN BECOME SUICIDEDLY DEPRESS THAT'S HOW BAD OSED CAN BE FOR US SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN SAYING THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH OSED ALSO HAVE ANXIETY OR EXONUMBER PEOPE ITH OSEDI AR ALSO DEPRESSED BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER NOT THE DEPRESSION LED THE OSD OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND OR WHETHER NOT THEIR OPERATING AS WE SAY IN SCIENCE IN PARALLEL SOME OF THE DRUG TREATMENTS FOR OSEDI IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY CAN TEASE SOME OF THAT APART AND WILL TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WHAT A BINDS THE OPSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS IS ANXIETY THAT THERE'S A FEELING OF T WHERE I SHOULD SAY AN URGENT FEELING OF A NEED TO GET RID OF THE OBCESSION AND THE PERSON FEELS AS IF THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DO THAT IS TO ENGAGE IN A PARTICULAR COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR SOME PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY WONDERING IF THERE'S A GENETIC COMPONENT TO OSED AND INDEED THERE IS ALTHOUGH THE NATURE OF IT IS AN EXACTLY CLEAR AND OFTEN TIMES WHEN PEOPLE HERE THAT SOMETHING HAS A GENETIC COMPONENT THEY THINK IT'S ALWAYS DIRECTLY INHERITED FROM APPARENT AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THERE CAN BE GENES THAT SURFACE IN SIBLINGS OR GENES THAT SURFACE AND CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CALL A PENOTYPES HE AVE A GENOTYPE THE GEN AN THEN YOU HAVE A FENOTYPE THE WAY IT SHOWS OUP AS A BODY FORM OR LIKE I COLLOR OR HOW IT SHOWS UP IN TERMS OF A BEHAVIOR OR BEHAVIORAL PATTERN BASED ON TWIN STUDIES WHERE RESEARCHERS HAVE EXAMINED IDENTICAL TWINS FRATERNAL TWINS EVEN IDENTICAL TWINS THAT SHARE THE SAME SACK IN UTERO THE WHAT WE CALL MONOCHORIONICS ARE SITTING IN THE SAME LITTLE BAG DURING PREGNANCY OR IN DIFFERENT LITTLE BAGS YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WHAT'S CALLED GENETIC CONCORDANCE BUT IF WE ARGE H SORT OF CUT CUT ABROAD SWATH THROUGH ALL THE GENETIC DATA IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY PER CENT OF OSED CASES AR HAVE SOME GENETIC COMPONENT SOME MUTATION OR SOME INHERITED ASPECT THAT'S GENETIC IN THAT ONE COULD POINT TO IF THEY GOT THEIR GENO MAPT NOW WHILE THAT'S INTERESTING I DON'T THINK IT'S TERRIBLY USEFUL FOR MOST PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL CAN'T REALLY CONTROL YOUR GENES AT LEST AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY EVEN THOUGH THEIR THINGS L IKE EPIGENETIC CONTROL AND PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT TECHNOLOGIES LIKE CRISPER FOR MODIFYING THE GENO IN HUMANS AT SOME POINT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T CONTROL THEIR GENETICS RIGHT YOU CAN'T PICK COO YOUR PARENTSORAS THEY SAY SO JUST KNOW THAT THERE IS A GENETIC COMPONENT IN ABOUT HALF OF PEOPLE WITH OSED BUT NOT ALWAYS NOW AS IS TYPICAL FOR THIS PODCAST I WANT A FOCUS ON SOME OF THE NOURL MECHANISMS AND CHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT GENERATE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER IN FACT YOUVE WATCH THIS PODCAST BEFORE LISTEN TO THIS PODCAST BEFORE THIS IS ALWAYS HOW I STRUCTURE THINGS FIRST WE INTRODUCE A TOPIC AND WE EXPLORE THAT TOPIC AN DETAIL REALLY TO FINE WHAT IT IS IN WHAT IT ISN'T AND THEN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT IS NOT KNOWN ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT GENERATE WHATEVER THAT THING HAPPENS TO BE IN THIS CASE OSEED IN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER NOW WONTO EMPHASIZE THAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BACKGROUND AND BIOLOGY I WILL MAKE THIS INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE TO YOU AND I ALSO WANE TO EMPHASIZE THAT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN TREATMENTS AND ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE DESCRIPTION OF THINGS THAT CAN HELP WITH OSED ENCOURAGE YOU IF YOU WILL TO PLEASE TRY AN DIGEST SOME OF THE MATERIAL ABOUT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS BECAUSE UNDERSTANDING EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THOSE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS CAN REALLY HELP SHED LIGHT ON WHY PARTICULAR DRUG AND BEHAVIAL TREATMENTS AND OTHER SORTS OF TREATMENTS WORK AND DON'T WORK THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE CASE OF OSEED WHERE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ORDER AND TYPE OF TREATMENT CAN REALLY VARY ACCORDING TO INDIVIDUAL AND THAT'S SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL AND IMPORTANT ABOUT OSEED THAT WE REALLY CAN'T SAY FOR NUMBER THE OTHER SORTS IVE DISORDERS THAT WEV DESCRIBED ON PREVIOUS PODCAS SO LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE NEURAL CIRCUITRY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BRAIN AND BODY OF PEOPLE WITH OSED WHY THE INTRUSIVE RECURRENT THOUGHTS WHY THE COMPULSIONS WHY IS THAT WHOLE SYSTEM BOUND BY ANXIETY AND IN SOME WAYS IN THINKING ABOUT THAT I WANT YOU TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE BRAIN HAS TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS THE BRAINS MAIN FUNCTIONS ARE TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE HOUSEKEEPING STUFF MAKE SURE DIGESTION WORKS MAKE SURE THE HEART BEATS MAKE SURE YOU KEEP BREATHING NO MATTER WHAT MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN HEAR YOU CAN SMELL AT CETERA THE BASIC STUFF AND THEN THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BRAIN REAL ESTATE THAT'S DESIGN TO ALLOW YOU TO PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT EITHER IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IN THE LONG TERM FUTURE AND LARGELY THAT'S DONE BASED ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST O YOU ALSO MEMORY SYSTEMS AND OF COURST YOU HAVE SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ARE DESIN TO BIND WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE HOUSEKEEPING LEVEL LIKE YOUR HEART RATE TO YOUR ANTICIPATION OF WHATS CAN HAPPEN NEXT O IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING VERY FEARFUL YOUR BODY WILL HAVE ONE TYPE OF REACTION IF YOU THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING VERY PLEASANT AND RELAXING YOUR BODY WILL HAVE ANOTHER TYPE OF REACTION SO WHENEVER I HEAR ABOUT THE BRAIN BODY DISTINCTION AVE TO JUST REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THERE REALLY IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN BRAIN AND BODY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THROUGH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE N RVOUS SYSTEM IS THE BRAIN THE EYES THE SPINAL CORD BUT OF COURSE ALL THEIR CONNECTIONS WITH ALL TE ORGANS OF THE BODY IN THE CONNECTIONS OF ALL THE ORGANS OF THE BODY WITH THE BRAIN THE SPINAL CORD ET CETERA SO AS I DESCRIBE THESE NEURAL CIRCUITS I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK OF THEM AS JUSTHINGS HAPPENING IN THE HEAD THEY ARE CERTAINLY HAPPENING IN THE HEAD IN FACT THE CIRCUITS ALLD THE SCRIBE MOST IN DETAIL DO EXIST WITHIN THE CONFINES OF YOUR CRANIAL VAULT THAT'S NERED SPEAK FOR SKULL BUT THOSE CIRCUITS ARE DRIVING PARTICULAR PREDICTIONS AND THEREFOR PARTICULAR BIASIS TOWARDS PARTICULAR ACTIONS IN YOUR BODY THEY'RE CREATING A STATE OF READINESS OR A STATE OF DESIRE TO CHECK OR DESIRE TO COUNT OR DESIRE TO AVOID ET CETERA ET CETERA SO WHAT ARE THESE CIRCUITS WELL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WONDERFUL RECEARCH EXPLORING THE NAURAL CIRCUITS UNDERLYING OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND THAT'S MAINLY BEEN ACCOMPLISH THREUGH A COUPLE OF METHODS MOST OF THOSE METHODS WHEN APPLIED IN HUMANS INVOLVE GETTING SOME LOOK INTO WHICH BRAIN AREAS ARE ACTIVE WHEN PEOPLE RE HAVING OBSECTIONS AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING IN COMPULSIONS NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM SIMPLE TO DO BUT OF COURSE YOUR BRAIN IS HOUSED INSIDE THE CRANIAL VAULT AND IN ORDER TO LOOK INSIDE IT YEF TO USE THINGS LIKE MAGNETIC RESONENCE IMAGING WHICH IS JUST FANCY TECHNOLOGY FOR LOOKING AT BLOOD FLOW WHICH RELATES TO ACTIVATION OF NURON'S NERVE CELLS OR THINGS LIKE PET P E T IMAGING WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VERB PET AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR HOUSE PET HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH POSITRONOMISSION TEMOGRAPHY WHICH IS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SEEING WHICH BRAIN AREAS ARE ACTIVE AND IN YOU CAN ALSO USE PETIVE FIGURE OUT WHAT SORTS OF NEURO CHEMICALS ARE ACTIVE LIKE DOPAMINE ET CETERA MANY STUDIES WE CAN FAIRLY SAY DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF STUDIES HAVE NOW IDENTIFIED A PARTICULAR CIRCUIT OR LOOP OF BRAIN AREAS THAT ARE INTERCONNECTED AND VERY ACTIVE IN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER THAT LOOP INCLUDES THE CORTECS WHICH IS KIND OF THE OUTER SHELL OF THE THE HUMAN BRAIN THE LUMPY STUFF AS IT SOMETIMES APPEARS IF THE SKULL IS REMOVED AND IT INVOLVES IN AREA CALLED THE STRIATUM WHICH IS INVOLVED IN ACTION SELECTION AND HOLDING BACK ACTION THE STRIATUM IS INVOLVED IN WHAT'S COMMONLY CALLED GO AND NOGO TYPES OF BEHAVIORS SO EVERY TYPE OF BEHAVIOR LIKE PICKING UP A PEN OR A MUG OF COFFEE INVOLVES A GO TYPE FUNCTION IS INVOLVES GENERATING IN ACTION BUT EVERY TIME I RESIST IN ACTION MY NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ALSO DOING THAT USING THIS BRAIN STRUCTURE THE STRIATUM WHICH INCLUDES AMONG OTHER THINGS THE BAZAL GANGLEA TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE WHEN I SRI TO OVERLOAD YOU WITH TERMINOLOGY HERE BUT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE INTERESTIN TERMINOLOGY SO WOU HAVE GO BEHAVIORS AND YOU HAVE NOGO RESISTING OF BEHAVIORS NOT GOING TOWARD BEHAVIOR THE CORTECS AND THE STRIATUM ARE IN THIS INTRICATE BACK IN FOR TALK ITS REALLY LOOPS OF CONNECTIONS THE CORTECS DOESN'T TELL THE TRIATUM WHAT TO DO THE STRIUM DOESN'T TELL THE CORTECS WHAT TO DO THEY'RE IN A CROSTOCK LIKE ANY GOOD RELATIONSHIP THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH COMMUNICATION THRE'S A THIRD ELEMENT IN THIS ORTICO STRIDAL LOOP AS IT'S CALLED AND THAT'S THE THALYMUS NOW THE THALYMUS IS NOT A STRUCTUR I'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT BEFORE ON THIS PODCASS BUT IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE STRUCTURES TO THINK ABOUT AND TEACH ABOUT IN NERANATOMY WHICH I TEACH I'M BACK IT STAMFORD AND AVE TAUGHT FOR MANY YOARS ELSEWHERE BECAUSE THE THALYMUS IS THIS INCREDIBLE EGLIKE STRUCTURE IN THE CENTERE OF YOUR BRAIN THAT HAS DIFFERENT CHANNELS THROUGH IT CHANNELS FOR RELAYING VISUAL INFORMATION OR AUDITORY INFORMATION OR TOUCH INFORMATION FROM YOUR ENVIRONMENT UP INTO YOUR QUARTEXAN AS A CONSEQUENCE MAKING CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO YOU AND AROUND YOU APPARENT TO YOU MAKING YOU AWARE OF THEM MAKING YOU PERCEIVE THEM AND SUPPRESSING OTHERS SO FOR INSTANCE RIGHT NOW IF YOURE HEARING ME SAY THIS YOUR THALYMS HAS WHAT ARE CALLED AUDITORY NUCLEATHERSERS COLLECTIONS OF NURONS THAT RESPOND TO SOUNDWAVES THAT OF COURSE COMING IN THROUGH YOUR EARS AND YOUR THALMUS IS ACTIVE IN A WAY THAT THOSE PARTICULAR REGIONS OF YOUR THALYMUS ARE ALOUD LITERALLY PERMITTED TO PASS THE INFORMATION COMING FROM YOUR EARS THROUGH SOME OTHER STEPS BUT THEN TO YOUR THALYMUS YOUR AUDITORY THALMISTAN UP TO YOUR QUARTEX AND YOU CAN HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW AT THE SAME TIME YOUR THALYMUS IS SURROUNDED BY A KIND OF A SHELL SOMETHING CLLED THE THYLAMIC RARTICULAR NUCLEUS AGAIN YOU DON'T HAFTE REMEMBER THE NAMES BUT THIS THELAMIC RARTICULAR NUCLEUS ALSO SOMETIMES CALLED THE RATICULAR THYLAMIC NUCLEUS THIS IS BELIEVE IT ARE NOT A SUBJECT OF DEBATE INSIZES OF PEOPLE THAT LITERALLY HATED EACH OTHER WHILE THEY STILL HATE EACH OTHER EVEN THE ONE OF THEM'S DEAD FOR DECADES BECAUSE THEY WOULD ARGUE IS THYLAMIC RARTICULAR NUCLEUS ETHER WITH RETE RIDICULAR THYLAMIC NUCLEUS ANYWAY IS OUR SCIENTISTS THEIR PEOPLE THEY TEND TO DEBATE BUT THE THELAMIC RARTICULAR NUCLEUS AS I'M GOING TO CALL IT SERVES AS A SORT OF GAIT AS TO WHICH INFORMATION IS ALLOWED TO PASS THROUGH UP TO YOUR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE AND WHICH IS NOT AND THAT GATING MECHANISM IS STRONGLY REGULATED BY THE CHEMICAL GABA GABA IS A NARROW TRANSMITTER THAT IS IN HIBATORY AS WE SAY IT SERVES TO SHUT DOWN OR SUPPRESS THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURRONS SO THE THYLAMIC RATICULAR NUCLEUS IS REALLY SAYING NO TUCH INFORMATION CANNOT COME IN RIGHT NOW YOU SHOULD NOT BE THINKING ABOUT THE CONTACT OF THE BACK OF YOUR LEGS WITH THE CHAIR THAT YOU'RE SITTING ON ANDREW YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TRING TO SAY AND WHAT YOU'RE HEARING AND HO YOUR VOICE SOUNDS AND WHAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU ET CETERA WHEREAS IF I'M ABOUT TO GET AN INJECTION FROM A DOCTOR OR I'M IN PAIN OR I'M IN PLEASURE I'M GOING TO THINK ABOUT MY SEMATIC SENSATION AT THE LEVEL OF TOUCH AND I'M PROBABLY IN TO THINK LESS ABOUT SMELLS IN THE REMOENT ALTHOUGH I MIGHT ALSO THINK ABOUT SMELLS IN THE ROOM OR WHAT I'M SEEING IN WHAT I'M HEARING WE CAN COMBINE ALL THESE DIFFERENT CENSERY MODALITIES BUT THE THYLAMIC RARTICULAR NUCLEUS REALLY ALLOWS US TO FUNNEL TO DIRECT PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF CENSORY EXPERIENCES INTO OUR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS AND SUPPRESS OTHER CATEGORIES OF SET SENSORY EXPERIENCE IN ADDITION THE THELAMIC RARTICULAR NUCLEUS PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN WHICH THOUGHTS ARE ALLOWED TO PASS UP TO OUR CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION AND WHICH ONES ARE NOT SO MUCH SO THAT SOME NERO SCIENTISTS AND INDEED SOME NEURO PHILOSOPHERS IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM THAT HAVE THEORIZED OR PHILOSOPIZE THAT THE THYLAMIC RARTICULAR NEWCLEAS IS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS NOW CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN A TOPIC THAT I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS EPISODE IN ITS E VERY KIND OF MUSHY MERKY AS WE SAY IN SCIENCE ITS A SCHMOEWY TERM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT IT OFTEN GET LOST IN THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE ARGUING ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS BUT WHEN I SAY CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT I MEAN AS CONSCIOUS AWARENESS SO LET'S ZUME OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE CIRCUIT THAT WE'VE GOT AND THAT WE NOW KNOW BASED ON NEROIMAGING STUDIES IS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN GENERATING OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS IN OSED WE HAVE A KORTEX OR NEO KORTEX WHICH IS INVOLVED IN PERCEPTION AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WE HAVE THE STRITUM AND BASL GANGLEA WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN GENERATING BEHAVIORS GO AND SUPPRESSING BEHAVIORS NOGO AND WE HAVE THE THALYMUS WHICH COLLECTS ALL OF OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCE IN PARALLEL HEARING TOUCH SMELL ET CETERA NOT SO MUCH SMELL THROUGH THE THALMAS I SHOUMENSION BUT THE OTHER SENSO SENSES THAT IS AND THEN THAT THALYMUS IS IN CASTE BY THE THYLAMIC RARTICULAR NEWCLEUS WHICH SERVES AS A KIND OF A A GUARD SAYING YOU CAN PASS THROUGH A NEWCOMPASS THROUGH BUT YU YOU U CAN'T PASS THROUGH UP TO CONSCIOUS UNDERSTANDING AN PERCEPTION SO THAT LOOP THIS CORTICO STRIDO THELAMIC LOOP KORTICOSTRITOTHELAMIC LOOP IS THE CIRCUIT THOUGHT TO UNDERLI OSED AND DISFUNCTION IN THAT CIRCUIT IS WHAT'S THOUGHT TO UNDERLYE OSED NOW AGAIN THI CIRCUIT EXISTS IN ALL OF US AND IT CAN OPERATE IN HEALTHY WAYS OR CAN OPERATING WAYS THAT MAKE US FEEL UNHEALTHY OR EVEN SUFFER FROM FULLON OSED HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS CIRCUIT IS INVOLVED IN OSED WELL THERE WE CAN LOOK TOS SOME REALLY INTERESTING STUDIES THAT INVOLVED BRINGING HUMAN SUBJECTS INTO THE LABORATORY AND GENERATING THEIR OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS AND THEN IMAGING THEIR BRAIN USING ANY VARIETY OF TECHNIKSTHAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHAT WOULD SUCH AN EXPERIMENT LOOK LIKE WELL IN ORDER TO DO THAT SORT OF EXPERIMENT FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED PEOPLE WHO HAVE OSED AND OF CORSE YOU NED CONTROL SUBJECTS THAT DON'T AND YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO RELIABLY EVOKE THE OBSESSIONS AND THE COMPULSIONS NOW TURNS OUT THIS IS MOST EASILY OR I SHOULD SAY MOST SIMPLY DONE CAUSE IT CAN'T BE EASY FOR THE PEOPLE WITH OSED BUT THIS IS MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT'S THE WHART ILWS LOKING FOR MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD WHEN LOOKING AT THE CATEGORY OF OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS THAT RELATE TO ORDER AND CLEANLINESS SO WHAT THEY DO TYPICALLY AS BRING SUBJECTS INTO THE LABORATORY WHO HAVE A OBSESSION ABOUT GERMS AN CONTAMINATION AND A COMPULSION TO HANDWASH AND THEY GIVE THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE IT OR NOT A SWEATY TOWEL THAT CONTAINS THE SWEAT AND THE ODOR AND THE LIQUID BASICALLY FROM SOMEBODY ELSE'S HANDS ENFECT THEY'L SOMETIMES HAVE SOMEONE WIPE THEIR OWN SWEAT OFF THE BACK OF THEIR NECK AND PUT IT ON THE TAL E N THEN THEY'LL PUT IT IN FRONT OF THE PERSON WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGIN FOR SOME ONE OF THE OSED IS INCREDIBLY ANXIETY PROVOKING AND ALMOST ALWAYS EVOKES THESE OBSESSIONS ABOUT O THIS IS REALLY A THIS IS REALLY BAD THIS IS REALLY BAT I NEED TO I NEED TO CLEAN I NEED TO CLEAN I NEED TO CLEAN NOW THEY'RE DOING ALL THIS WHILE SOME ONE IS IN A BRAIN SCANNER OR WHILE THEY'RE BEING IMAGE FOR POSITRONOMISSION TEMOGRAPHY AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO LOOK ATHE PATTERNS OF ACTIVATION IN THE BRAIN WHILE THE PERSON IS DOING HAND WASHING ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THE APORATEYE ASSOSIE WITHTHESE IMAGING STUDIES MAYE IT HARD TO DO A LOT OF MOVEMENT THEY CAN DO THESE SORTS OF STUDIES THEY HAVE DONE THESE SORTS OF STUDIES IN MANY SUBJECTS USING DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF WHAT IE JUST DESCRIBED AND LONE BEHOLD WHAT LIGHTS UP WHEN I SEY LIGHTS UP WHAT WHAT SORTOF BRAIN REGIONS ARE MORE METABOLICALLY ACTIVE MORE BLOOD FLOW MOR NOR AL ACTIVITY WELL IT'S THIS PARTICULAR CORTICO STRIDAL THYLAMIC LOOP IN ADDITION TO THAT SOME OF THE DRUG TREATMENTS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN SOME AND I WANT EMPHASIZE SOME INDIVIDUALS AT SUPPRESSING OBSESSIONS AND ORE COMPULSIONS SUCH AS THE SELECTIVE CERITONE AND REUP TAKEN HIBITORS OR ESSESSOR IYES WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT AN LOW BIT WHEN PEOPLE TAKE THOSE DRUGS THEY SEE NOJOUS A SUPPRESSION OF THE OBSESSION AND COMPULSION BUT ALSO A SUPPRESSION OF THESE PARTICULAR NERAL CIRCUITS THEY BECOME LESS ACTIVE NOW I WANT IT EMPHASIZE AND TELEGRAPH A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT'S COMING LATER THESE DRUGS LIKE ASSESSORIZE DO NOT WORK FOR EVERYBODY WITH OSED AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THEY CARRY OTHER CERTAIN PROBLEMS AND SIDE EFFECTS FOR MANY BUT NOT ALL INDIVIDUALS BUT NONE THE LESS WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS IN OBSERVATION THAT THIS CIRCUIT THE CORTICAL STRIDO PHILAMIC LOOP IS ACTIVE INOSED WE HAVE A MANIPULATION THAT WHEN PEOPLE TAKE A DRUG THAT AT LEAST IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS EFFECTIVE IN SUPPRESSING OR ELIMINATING THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS THERE'S LESS ACTIVITY IN THE SLOOP AND THANKS TO SOME VERY GOOD ANIMAL MODEL STUDIES THAT AT LEAST AT THIS POIN TIME YOU REALLY COULDN'T DO IN HUMANS ALTHOUGH SOON THAT MAY CHANGE WE NOW KNOW IN A CAUSAL WAY THAT THE EQUIVALENT CIRCUITRY A EXISTS IN OTHER ANIMALS SUCH AS MICE SUCH AS CAT SUCH AS MONKEYS AND THAT ACTIVATION OF THOSE PARTICULAR CORTICOLSTRITAL THYLAMIC CIRCUITS IN ANIMAL MODELS CAN INDEED EVOKE OSD IN AN INDIVIDUAL THAT PRIOR TO THAT DID NOT HAVE OC D SOME JUSTCAN AF BRIEFLY DESCRIBE ONE CSTUDY THIS IS A NOW CLASSIC STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE ONE OF THE THREE A PEXTERNALS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE FIRST AUTHOR ON THIS PAPER IS A SUSANA MARI A H AN A ARE IY I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS IN THE SHONOTES IS A TRULY LANDMARK PAPER DONE IN RENAHENS LAB AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS REPEATED CORTICO STRITE O STIMULATION GENERATES THAT'S THE KEY WORD HERE GENERATES PERSISTENT OSED LIKE BEHAVIOR WHAT THEY DID AS THEY TOOK MICE MICE DO MOUSE THINGS THEY MOVE ROUND THEY PLAVATOIS THEY EAT THEY E THEY MAINT THEY DO VARIOUS THINGS IN THEIR CAGE BUT THEY ALSO GROOM HUMAN SGROOM ANIMALS WITH FUR GROOM YOU HOPE MOST PEOPLE GROOM  SOME PEOPLE OVER GROOM SOME PEOPLE UNDERGROOM MOST PEOPLE GROOM THEY'LL COMB THEIR HAIR THEY'LL CLEAN AT CETERA THOSE ARE NORMAL BEHAVIORS THAT HUMANS ENGAGE IN I'M NOT AWARE THAT MICE COME THE ER BUT MICE ADJUST THEIR HAIR SO THEY CONOF PET THEIR HAIR DTHEY'LL DO THIS SILL SOME IES EVEN DO IT TO EACH OTHER WE STAVE MICE IN LAB NOW WE ONLY DO HUMAN STUDIES BUT THE THE MICE WILL GROOM THEMSELVES AND TYPICAL WHAT WE CALL WILD TYPE MICE NOT BECAUSETHEIRE WILD BUT BECAUSE THEI'R TYPICAL WILL GROOM THEMSELVES AT A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY BUT NOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEIR HAIR IS FALLING OUT NOT CONSTANTLY THEY ARE GROOMING SOME OF THE TIME AND THEIR DOING OTHER MOUSE THINGS OTHER MOUSETIMES SO IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY USED SOME TECHNOLOGY WHICH ACTUALLY WAS DISCUSSED ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE OF THE HUBRUMAN LADPODCAST THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY A PSYCHIOTRIST AND BY ENGINEER BY THE NAME OF CARL DICEROTH ONE OF MY COLLEAGES IT THAT STANFORD SCHOL OF MEDICINE THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS RESEARCHES TO USE THE PRESENTATION OF LIGHT TO CONTROL NERAL ACTIVITY IN PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS IN A VERY HIGH FIDELITY WAY YOU CONTROL THE ACTIVITY IN THE CUARTECS OF THE STRIATUM OR THE THALMAS WHEN YOU WANT AN HOW YOU WANT IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL TECHNOLOGY IN ANY EVENT WHAT THEY DID IN THE STUDY IS OR I SHOULD SAY WHAT SUSANAMARI AND COLLEAUES DID IN THE STUDY WAS TO STIMULATE THE CORTICA STRIATAL CIRCUITRY IN ANIMALS THAT DID NOT HAVE ANY OSED LIKE BEHAVIOR AND WHEN THEY DID THAT THOSE ANIMALS STARTED GROOMING INCESSANTLY TO THE POINT WHERE THEIR HAIR WAS FALLING OUT OR THEY EVEN YOU KOW THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE EXPERIMENTS THIS FAR FORTUNATELY BUT THE ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A TENDENCIED ALMOST RUB THEMSELVES RAW IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOMEBODY WHO HAS A COMPULSION TO HANDWASH WOULD SADLY PEOPLE WILL HANDWASH TO THE POINT WHERE THEIR HANDS ARE ACTUALLY BLEEDING AND RAW IT'S REALLY THAT BAD I KNOW IT'S TOUGH IMAGERY TO IMAGINE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHY SOME ONE WOULD SELF HARM IN THAT WAY BUT AGAIN THAT'S THAT INCREDIBLE ANXIETY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPULSION SCUSE ME THE OBSESSION AND THE COMPULSION AND THE FACT THAT ENGAGING IN THE COMPULSION SIMPLY STRENGTHENS THE OBSESSION AND THEIRE FOR THE ANXIETY SO THAT COLLECTION OF STUDIES OF DATA EPERMARI PET SCANNING IN HUMANS THE TREATMENT WITH ESSESSORIYES IND THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE RESEARCERS HAVE ACTIVELY TRIGGERED THESE PARTICULAR CIRCUITS IN ANIMAL MODELS THAT PREVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE TOO MUCH ACTIVITY IN THESE CIRCUITS AND THEN THEY OBSERVE OSD EMERGING REALLY POINT SQUARELY TO THE FACT THAT THE CORTICAL STRIDE OF THELAMIC LOOP IS LIKELY TO BE THE BASIS OF OSED NOW OF COURSE OTHER CIRCUITS COULD ALSO BE INVOLVED BUT THE CORTICAL STRID O THYLAMIC CIRCUITS SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN CIRCUIT GENERATING OSEED LIKE BEHAVIOR THAT'S A LOT OF MECHANISM HOFLLY IT WAS DESCRIBED IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN DIGEST AND UNDERSTAND AND SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING WILL SO WHAT WHAT WHY DOES IT HELP MEIM AND I CAN'T REACH IN TO MY BRAIN AND TURN OFF MY QARTEX I CAN'T REACH INTO MY BRAIN AND TURN AL F MY THALMAS AND INDEED ON THE ONE HAND THAT'S TRUE BUT AS YOU'LL NEXT LEARN WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS AND DRUG TREATMENTS AND HOLISTIC TREATMENTS FOR OSED WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE IS THAT EACH ONE TAPS INTO A DIFFERENT COMPONENT OF THIS CORTICOSTRIATAL THALAMIC LOOP AND BY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CAN START TO SEE WHY CERTAIN TREATMENTS MIGHT WORK AT ONE STAGE OF THE ILLNESS FIRSE AS OTHERS YOU WILL ALSO STARC TO UNDERSTAND WHY OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME SORTS OF ENGAGEMENTS OF THESE NERAL LOOPS AND YET RELIES ON OTHER ASPECTS OF BRAIN AND BODY AND THEREFORE RESPONDS BEST TO OTHER SORTS OF TREATMENTS OR IN SOME CASES PEOPLE WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER ARE NOT EVEN SEEKING TREATMENT AS I ALLUDED TO BEFOR THE POINT HERE IS THAT BY UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM WHY CERTAIN DRUGS AND BEHAVORAL TREATMENTS WORK AND DON'T WORK WILL BECOME IMMEDIATELY APPARENT AND IN THINKING ABOUT THAT IN KNOWING THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE EXCELLENT CHOICES I BELIEVE IN TERMS OF WHAT SORTS OF TREATMENTS YOU PURSUE WHAT SORTS OF TREATMENTS YOU ABANDON AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ORDER THE SEQUENCE THAT YOU PURSUE AND APPLY THOSE TREATMENTS BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I LIKE TO GIVE PEOPLE WHA BIT OF A WINDOWIN TO WHAT A DIAGNOSIS FOR OSED WOULD LOOK LIKE  YOU SENSE OF THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT A CLANITION WOULD ASK TO DETERMIN WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY HAS OSEDE OR NOT NOW WHN I BE CLEAR I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS IN AN EXHAUSTIVE WAY I WOULDNT WANT ANY ONE TO SELF DIAGNOSE ALTHOUGH I'M HOPING THAT BY SHARING SOME OF THIS THAT SOME OF YOU MIGHT GET INSIDE INTO WHETHER NOT YOU DO HAVE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS THAT MIGHT QUALIFY FOR OSED AND A PERHAPS EVEN TO SEEK OUT HELP THE MOST COMMONLY USED TEST OF OSED OR FOR OSEEDI I SHOULD SAY IS CALLED THE YALE BROWN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE SCALE AND THIS IS A YOU SCIENTISTS LOVE ACRANYMS AS DO THE MILITARY AND IT'S THE WIBOX THE WHY DASH B O S AS THE WYIBOX SOTYPICALLY SOME ONE WILL GO INTO THE CLENIC EITHER BECAUSE A FAMILY MEMBER ENCOURAGE THEM TO OR BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THEIR SUFFERING FROM OSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS AND BEFORE THE CLINITION WOULD PROCEED WITH ANY KIND OF DIRECT QUESTIONS THEY WOULD VERY CLEARLY DEFINE WHAT OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS ARE IN HERE I MASHI READING FROM THE WIBOX SO QUOTE OBSESSIONS ARE UNWELCOME IN DISTRESSING IDEAS THOUGHTS IMAGES ORE IMPULSES THAT REPEATEDLY ENTER YOUR MIND THEY MAY SEEM TO OCCUR AGAINST YOUR WILL THEY MAY BE REPUGNANT TO YOU YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THEM AS SENSELESS AND THEY MAY NOT FIT YOUR PERSONALITY THEN THERE ARE COMPULSIONS QUOTE COMPULSIONS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE BEHAVIOURS ARE ACTS THAT YOU FEEL DRIVEN TO PERFORM ALTHOUGH YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THEM AS SENSELESS OR EXCESSIVE AT TIMES YOU MAY TRY TO RESIST DOING THEM BUT THIS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT YOU MAY EXPERIENCE ANXIETY THAT DOES NOT DIMINISH UNTIL THE BEHAVIOR IS COMPLETED AND AS I MENTION BEFORE IN MANY CASES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BEHAVIOR IS COMPLETED THE ANXIETY DOESN'T JUST RETURN IT INDEED CAN STRENGTHEN NOW THERE ARE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ON THE WIBOX SO JUST GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE GENERAL CATEGORIES TYPICALLY THE PERSON WILL FILL OUT A CHECLIST SO THEY WILL DESIGNATE WHETHER NOT CURRENTLY OR IN THE PAST THEY HAVE FOR INSTANCE AGGRESSIVE OBSESSIONS FEAR THAT ONE MIGHT HARM THEMSELVES FEAR THAT ONE MIGHT HARM OTHERS FEAR THAT THEY'LL STEEL THINGS EAR THAT THEY WILL ACT ON UNWANTED IMPULSES CURRENTLY R IN THE PAST OR BOTH IT'S ONE CATEGORY THE OTHER ONE ARE CONTAMINATION OBSESSIONS SO CONCERN WITH DIRT OR GERMS BOTHERED BY STICKY SUBSTANCES OR RESIDUES ET CETERA ET CETERA SO E BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT INCLUDE FOR INSAN SECTUAL OBSESSIONS WHAT ARE CALLED SAVING OBSESSIONS EVEN MORAL OBSESSIONS RIGHT EXCESS CONCERN WITH WRIHTE OR WRONG OR MORALITY CONCERNED WITH SACRILEGE AN BLASPHEMY OBSESSION WOULD NEED FOR SYMMETRY AND EXACTNESS AGAIN ALL THESE QUESSIONS BEING ANSWERED AS EITHER PRESENT IN THE PAST ERE NOT PRESENT THE PAST PRESENT CURRENTLY OR NOT PRESENT CURRENTLY AND THEN THE THE TEST GENERALLY TRANSITIONS OVER TO QUESTIONS ABOUT TARGET SYMPTOMS THE REALLY CRINAND GET PEOPLE'S IDENTIFY IF THEY HAVE OBSESSIONS WHAT ARE THEIR EXACT OBSESSIONS NOW THIS TURNS OUT TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE TALKI ABOUT SOME OF THE THERAPIES THAT REALLY WORK I'LL JUST GIVE AWAY A LITTLE BIT OF WHY THEY WORK BEST IN CERTAIN CASES AND WHY THEY DON'T WORK AS WELL IN OTHER CASES IT TURNS OUT THAT IT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CLINITION AND THE PATION TO NOT JUST IDENTIFY THE OBSESSIONS IN THE COMPULSIONS GENERALLY IN ACCIND OF A GENERIC OR TOP CONTOUR WAY BUT TO REALLY EN COURAGE OR EVEN FORCED THE PATIEN TO DEFINE VERY PRECISELY WHAT THE BIGGEST MOST CATESTROPHIC FEAR IS WHAT THE BSESSION REALLY RELATES TO THAT TURNS OUT O BE VERY IMPORTANT IN DESTRUCTING THIS CORTICOSTRITO PHILAMIC LOOP AND GETTING RELIEF FROM SYMPTOMS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SO THE YALBROWN OSESSIVE COMPULSIVE GALL THIS WYBOX AGAIN IS VERY EXTENSIVE IT GOES ON FOR DOZENS OF PAGES ACTUALLY AND HAS ALL THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES NOT SO MUCH DESIGNE TO JUST PIN POINT WHAT PEOPLE OBSESS ABOUT OR WHAT THEY FEEL COMPELLED TO DO BUT TO ALLSO TRY AND IDENTIFY WHAT IS THE FEAR THAT'S DRIVING ALL THIS MIGHT IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE SET THIS UP THUS FAR WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OF SESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS AS AND OF EXISTING IN A VACUM YOU'E OBSESSED ABOUT GERMS AND YOUR COMPELLED TO WASH YOR HANDS OBSESTD ABOUT GERMS COMPELL TO WASH OUR HNDS OR OBSESSED ABOUT SYMMETRY COMPELLED TO PUT RIGHT ANGLES ON EVERYTHING OR OBSESSED ABOUT COUNTING AND THEREFORE COUNTING ET CETERA BUT BENEATH THAT IS A COGNIVE COMPONENT THAT IS NOT AT ALL APPARENT FROM SOME ONE DESCRIBING THEIR OBSESSION AND FROM SOME ONE DESCRIVING OR DISPLAYING THEIR COMPULSION THE DEEPER LAYER TO ALL THAT IS WHAT IS THE FEAR EXACTLY IF ONE WORK TO NOT PERFORM THE COMPULSION MEANING WHAT IS THE FEAR THAT'S DRIVING THE OBSESSION SO THAT BRINGS US TO A VERY POWERFUL CATEGORY OF TREATMENTS THAT I SHOULD SAY DOES NOT WORK IN EVERYBODY WITH O SED BUT WORKS IN MANY PEOPLE WITH O SED AND REALLY SPEAKS TO THE UNDERLYING NEURAL CIRCUITRY THAT GENERATES SO SED AND HOW TO INTERRUPT IT AND THAT IS THE TREATMENT OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR AL THERAPY AND IN PARTICULAR EXPOSURE BASED COGNA OF BEHAVIOUR AL THERAPY SO WERGNO TOLK ABOUT COGNA BEHAVIORALTHERAPE AN EXPOSURE THERAPY NOW BUT RIGHT AT THE OUTSET I WANT TO DISTINGUISH THE KINDS OF COGNA BEHAVIORAL THERAPEAN EXPOSURE THERAPES THAT ARE DONE FOR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER THE SORTS OF COGNAM BEHAVORALTHERAPIES THAT ARE DONE FOR OTHER TYPES OF MENTAL CHALLENGES IN DISORDERS BECAUSE COGNA BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR O C D REALLY HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IDENTIFYING THE UTMOST FEAR IN SOME SENSE WE CAN THINK OF FEARS AS KIND OF ALONG A HIERACHY RIGHT IN THE EXAMPLE EARLIER OF SOMEBODY BEING AFRAID TO TURN LAFGHT IN THEREFORE FEELING COMPELLED TO TURN RIGHT YOUWOULD WANT TO TAKE THAT PERSON AND REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT DO THEY FEAR MOST ABOUT TURNING LEFT NOW THEY MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF IT THEY MIGHT NOT BE CONSCIOUS TO WHAT THAT REALLY IS BUT IF YOU WERE TO PROBE THEM IN A CLINICAL SETTING YOU WOULD EVENTUALLY GET TO AN ANSWER THAT ANSWER COULD BE AT FIRST I DON'T KNOW JUST IT'S JUST BAD I I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S BAD IT MAKES NO SENSE BUT I ITS JUST BAD I DO NOT WANT TO GO LEFT I DON'T KNOW WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT IF YOU WERE TO PUSH THAT PERSON A LITTLE BIT IN A RESPECTFUL AND KIND IN CARRYING WAY AIM THAT THEIR TREATMEN IF YOU WERE TO PUSH THEM AS THEY WILL WHAT YOU MEAN MY BAD IF YOU TURN LEFGT DO YOU THINK OF THE WORLD WOULD END THEY MIGHT TY KNOW THE WORLD'S NOK IN AT END BUT YOU SOME ONE IS GOING TO DIE SUDDENLY I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT SOMEBODY'S GOING TO DIE SUDDENLY AT ALMOSIT THIS ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE SUPERSTITION ABOUT SUPERSTITIONS LATER BUT INDEED IT IS SOMEWHAT SUPERSTITIOUS SO FOR INSETANCE YOU WOULD SAY WHOSE GAN ADIE AND THEY'D SAY I DON'T KNOW AND YOU SAY NO REALLY WHOSE GCAN ADIE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS ARE YOU GOING TO DIE IS SO AND SO GOING TO DIE AND VERY OFTEN VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT PEOPLE WILL START TO REVEAL THE UNDERLYING OBSESSION AT A LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT BOTH TO THE CLINITION AND TO THEM CAN BE SOMEWHAT ASTONISHING EVEN THOUGH TEY'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THAT DETAIL IN THEIR MIND FOR A VERY LONG TIME NOW HOW COULD SOMEBODY STARE TO REVEAL DETAIL ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S EXISTED IN THEIR MIND FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT NOT KNOWN ABOUT IT RIGHT NOT BEEN AWARE OF IT NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT THINK OH IT'S REPRESSED OR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT'S HAPPENING IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF O C D TYPICALLY PEOPLE WILL HAVE AN OBSESSION AND THEN THEY'LL ENGAGE IN THE COMPULSION AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN TO RELIEVE THAT OBSESSION SO IN MANY WAYS THE DISEASE ITSELF PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM EVER GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT TROUGH EVER GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY REALLY CLEARLY ARTICULATE TO THEMSELVES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT THEY FEAR BUT IT BECOME SO ESSENTIAL TO ARTICULATE EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT THEY FEAR FOR A SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTO IT IFE REASON YOU MIGHT THINK OH THE MOMENT THEY REALIZE EXACTLY WHAT THEY FEAR EVERYTHING LISTS THE CIRCUIT TURNS OFF AND THEY JUST FEEL BETTER BECAUSE THEY REALIZED IT I WISH I COULD ELL YOU THAT'S THE CASE BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S THE OPPOSITE WHAT THE CLINITION IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO IS G T PEOPLE TO FEEL MORE ANXIETY NOT LESS WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THEM TO DO IS TO SHORT CIRCUIT NO PON INTENDED TO INTERVENE IN THEIR OWN NERAL CIRCUIT I SHOULD SAY WITH THAT RELIEF OF ANXIETY HOWEVER BRIEF BROUGHT ON BY ENGAGING IN THE COMPULSION RELATED TO THE OBCESSION SO WHEREAS TYPICALLY SOME ONE WOULD FEEL THE OBCESSION WITH O I DON'T WANT TO TURN LEFT TO SOMETHING BADS CAN HAPPEN SOME ONES CAN TO DIE AND THEN THEY TURN RIGHT THEY NEVER GET THE OPTION ER THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY EXPLORE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO TURN LEFT OR TO NOT BE ABLE TO TURN RIGHT BY FORCING THEM DOWN THE PATH OF INQUIRY THAT LEADS THEM TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY VERY CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE FEAR THE ANXIETY IT RAISES THE ANXIETY IN THEM AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT THE CLINITION IS AFTER COGNA BEHAVIORALTHERAPY AND EXPOSURE THERAPY IN THE CONTECT OF OSEDY MOST OFTEN INVOLVES TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO TOLERATE NOT RELIEVE THEIR ANXIETY THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I REALIZE THEIRE'S VARIATION TO THIS DEPENDING ON THE STYLE OF COGNA BEHAVIOR ALTHERAPY THE STYLE OF EXPOSURE THERBE BUT ALMOST ACROSS THE BORD THE GOAL AGAIN IS TO GET PEOPLE TO FEEL THE ANXIETY THAT NORMALLY THEY ARE ABLE TO AT LEAST PARSALY RELIEVE HOWEVER BRIEFLY BY ENGAGING IN THE COMPULSION SO IF WE THINK BACK TO THAT CIRCUIT OF CORTICOSTRITAL PHILAMIC WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WHERE IS SB T INTERVENING WHAT PART OF THE CIRCUIT IS GETTING INTERRUPTED ILE AS YOU RECALL THE QARTEXES INVOLVED IN CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION THE THALYMUS AND THAT THYLEMIC RARTICULAR NUWCLEUS ARE INVOLVED IN THE PASSAGE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF EXPERIENCE UP TO OUR CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION NOT OTHERS AND THE STRITUM IS INVOLVED IN THIS GO NO GO TYPE BEHAVIOR WHEN OS D IS REALLY EXPRESSING ITSELF IN ITS FULLNESS PEOPLE FEEL AN ANXIETY AROUND A PARTICULAR THOUGHT AND THEY EITHER HAVE A GO FOR INSTANCE WASH HANDS OR A NO GO DO NOT TURN LEFT TYPE REACTION BY HAVING PEOPLE PROGRESSIVELY IN A COND OF HYARCHICAL WAY REVEEL THEIR PRECISE SOURCE OF ANXIETY THEIR UTMOST FEAR IN THIS CONTEXT WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY FEEL ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF ANXIETY TREATMENT OR OTHER TYPES OF TREATMENTS THE GOA WOULD BE TO TEACH PEOPLE TO DAMPEN TO LESSEN THEIR ANXIETY THROUGH BREATHING TECHNIQUES OR THROUGH VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES OR THROUGH SELF TALK OR THROUGH SOCIAL SUPPORT ANY IN THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WELL KNOWN TO HELP PEOPLE SELF REGULATE THEIR OWN ANXIETY HERE IT'S THE OPPOSITE BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE PATIEN TO DO IS TO REALLY FEEL THE ANXIETY AT ITS MAXIMUM BUT THEN DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHATEVER THE NORMAL COMPULSION IS SO IF NORMALLY THE COMPULSION IS TO WASH ONE'S HANDS THAN THE IDEA IS TO SUPPRESS HAND WASION WHILE BEING IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE UTMOST ANXIETY OR IN THE CASE OF NOT TURNING LEFT THE PERSON IS EXPECTED TO OR WOULD HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TURN LEFT AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WOULD EVOKE TREMENDOUS ANXIETY AND YET TO TOLERATE THAT ANXIETY NOW ONE O BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT THE SORT OF THING YOU WANT TO DO WAN YOUR OWN THIS IS NOT THE SORT OF THING YOU WANT TO DO FOR A FRIEND THIS IS DONE BY TRAINED LICENSE PSYCHOLOGIST AND PSYCHIATRIS BUT NONE THE LESS IT REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT AS A ANXIETY RELATED DISORDER OCD IS DISTINCT FROM OTHER TYPES OF ANXIETY AND ANXIETY RELATED DISORDERS THINGS LIKE PT ST AND PANIC DISORDER ET CETERA BECAUSE THE GOAL AGAIN IS TO BRING THE PERSON RIGHT UP CLOSE TO THE THING THAT THEY FEAR THE MOST AND THEN TO INTERRUPT THE CIRCUIT AND NOW YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO NOW JUST INTUITIVELY BECAUSEYOU UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS THAT THE CIRCUIT YOUR TRINE TO DISRUPT IS THE PATTERN OF INFORMATION FLOW FROM THE THINKING PART OF THE BRAIN THE PERCEPTION PART OF THE BRAIN WHICH IS THE THE QUARTEX TO THE STRITUM RIGHT THE STRIATUM HAS THESE NURONS WHICH ARE ACTIVE THAT ESSENTIALLY ARE NOW IT SOUNDS ALOB IT LIKE A DISCUSSION ABOUT FREE WILL BUT THEIR TRING TO GET SOME THE PERSON TO GENERATE A CERTAIN BEHAVIOR SUPPRESS A CERTAIN BEHAVIOR AND AS ANXIETY RAMPS UP IT SORT OF A HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TO DO THAT VERY THING THAT THEY'VE DONE FOR SO LONG AN THEY SUFFER FROM SO MUCH WE TALK ABOUT HYDRAULIC PRESSURE IN THE CONTECT OF AGGRESSION IN THE AGGRESSION EPISODE THIS IS VERY SIMILAR RIGHT THERE'S A CUN OF A NOW WHEN I SAY HYDRAULIC PRESSURE ITS NOT ACTUAL HYDRAULIC PRESSURE IT'S THE CONFLUENCE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ITS NOR CHEMICALIS WILL SOON LEARN ITS HORMONAL IT'S ELECTRICAL ITS IT'S A LOT OF DIFERENT THINGS OPERATING IN PARALLELS WE CAN'T POINT TO ONE CHEMICAL OR TRANSMITTER WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE PERSON IS FEELING COMPELLED TO ACT ACT ACT TO RELIEVE THE ANXIETY AND THROUGH A PROGRESSIVE TYPE OF EXPOSURE OW YOU DON'T THROW PEOPLE IN THE DEEP END IN THIS KIND OF THERI BE RED OFF THE BAT YOU GRADUALLY RACHAT THEM TOWARD OR MOVE THEM TOWARD THE DISCUSSION OF EXACTLY WHAT THEY FEAR THE MOST AND THEN EVENTUALLY MOVE THEM TOWARD THE INTERRUPTION OF THE COMPULSION AS THEIR FEELING THIS EXTREMELY ELEVATED ANXIETY OF COURSE WITHIN THE CONTET OF A SUPPORTIVE CLINICAL SETTING BUT IN DOING THAT WHAT YOU ARE TEACHING PEOPLE IS THAT THE ANXIETY CAN EXIST WITHOUT THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN THE COMPULSION NOW SOME OF THIS MIGHT SOUND TO PEOPLE LIKE THIS IS A  LOT OF KIND OF FANCY PSYCHOLOGICAL NEURO SCIENCE SPEAK AROUNDS ON THE IS KIND OF INTUITIVE BUT I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE THIS IS NOT INTUITIVE AND FOR PEOPLE WITH O D THE THERE'S NO REALLY OTHER WAY TO PUT IT THE IMPULSE THE THE COMPULSION TO AVOID ANXIETY IS SUCH A POWERFUL DRIVING FORCE THAT IT SHOULD NOW MAKE SENSE TO YOU AS TO WHY BEING ABLE TO TOLERATE ANXIETY AND REALLY SIT WITH IT AND DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU'RE NORMALLY COMPELLED TO DO IS GOING TO BE THE PATH TREATMENT AND INDEED C B T HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ENORMOUSLY EFFECTIVE AGAIN FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH OC D BUT NOT ALL OF THEM AND OFTENTIMES IT REQUIRES THAT ALSO BE USED IN CONCERT WITH CERTAIN DRUG TREATMENTS WHICH WERE GING TO TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT NEXCELLETS TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE REALLY UNIQUE FEATURES OF COGNA BEHAVIOUR 'L THERAPY AN EXPOSURE THERAPY IN THE CONTEXT OF OSED THAT YOU OFTEN DON'T SEE IN THE USE OF C B T THAT IS COGNAN BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR OTHER TYPES OF PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES IN DISORDERS THE FIRST ELEMENT IS ONE OF STAIRCASING AND I ALREADY MENTION THIS BEFORE BUT THIS GRADUAL AND PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN THE ANXIETY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO EVOKE FROM THE PATIENT FROM THE PERSON SUFFERING FROM OSED THAT'S DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OFFICE OR THE LABORATORY AGAIN BY A TRAINED IN LICENSE CLINITION BUT THEN THE PERSON LEAVES RIGHT THEY LEAVE THE OFFICE THEY LEAVE THE THE LABORATORY AN A VERY VITAL COMPONENT OF S B T AN EXPOSURE THERAPY FOR PEOPLE THOSED IS THAT THEY HAVE AND PERFORM WHAT'S CALLED HOMEWORK IS LITRALLY WHAT THEY CALL THIS MIGHT BE SEEN IN OTHER SORTS OF TREATMENTS BUT FOR OSED HOMEWORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHIN THE CONTEXTS OF A LABORATORY EXPERIMENT OF THE CLINIC PATIENTS OFTEN FEEL SO MUCH SUPPORT THAT THEY CAN TOLERATE THOSE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND INTERRUPT THEIR COMPULSIONS WHEREAS WHEN THEY GET HOME OFTEN TIMES THE FAMILIARITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT BRINGS THEM TO A PLACE WHERE ALL A SUDDEN THOSE OBSESTIONS AND COMPULSIONS START INTERACTING THE SAME WAY N THATVE A VERY HARD TIME SUPPRESSING THE BEHAVIORS WHY WOULD THAT BE WELL IN NUROL SCIENCE WE HAVE A PHRASE IT'S CALLED CONDITION PLACE PREFERENCE AND CONDITION PLACE AVOIDANCE THERE SOME OTHER PHRASES TOO BUT BASIL AT ALL HAS TO DO WITH A SIMPLE THING WHICH IS WHEN YOU FEEL SOMETHING REPEATEDLY IN A GIVEN ENVIRONMENT SOMETIMES EVEN ONCE WITHIN A GIVEN ENVIRONMENT YOU TEND TO FEEL THAT SAME THING AGAIN WHEN YOU RETURN TO THAT OR SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTS CASO CONDITION PLACE BLANK ER CONDITION PLACE THAT IS SIMPLY FANCY NERD SPEAK FORE THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU'RE NO PLACE IN SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS YOU TEND TO FEEL GOOD IF YOU RE TURN TO THAT PLACE OR A PLACE LIKE IT OR IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS IN THA GIVEN PLACE YOU TEND TO FEEL BAD WHEN YOU RETURN TO THAT PLACE OR A PLACE LIKE IT I THINK THAT MOST SAILIG A EXAMPLE THAT LEAPS TO MINE IS IN UN FORTUN THE CATEGORY OF BAD BUT I HAD SOME FRIENDS A YEARS AGO A VISIT SAN FRANCISCO THERE'S BEEN A ON GOING IT SEEMS LIKE THEBEEN HAPPENING FOREVER BUT THIS IS REALLY IN THE LAST DECADE OF OF DAYTIME BREAK INS AND NIGHTIME BREAK INS INTO CARS TO STEEL ANYTHING FROM COMPUTERS TO WHAT SEEMS TO E LIKE A BOX OF TISSUES AND THEIRE NUMEROUS REASONS FOR THIS I DO'T WANT TO GET INTO IT'S NOT THE TOPIC OF TO DAY'S PODCAST BUT I WILL USE IS THE TOPPORTUNE O SAY IF YOU'RE VISING ANYWHERE IN THE BA AREA DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING IN YOUR CAR BECAUSE THE WINDOW WELL GET BROKEN INTO SOMETIMES IN BROAD DAYLIGHT SOME GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE WERE VISITING THE BAY AREA AND I TEXTED THEM AND SAID A AY BY THE WAY WHEN YOUREHEADED TO DINNER GUIDES MAKE SURE YOU BRING IN ALL EUR LUGGAGE AND COMPUTERS HOWEVER CONVE INCONVENIENT THAT MIGHT BE THEY WROTE BACK TOO LATE EVERYTHING GOT STOLEN SOAS SOME YEARS AGO NOW I THINK FIVE SIX YEARS AGO THIS HAPPENED SADLY ALL EVERYTHING GOT STOLEN MOST OF IT CULD BE REPLACE BUT SOME OF IT WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL TO THEM EVERY TIME WE T EVERY TIME WE CONSIDER HAVING A MEETING IN A PARTICULAR ITY THIS COMES UP AS I DON'TWANT I DON'AT TO BE THERE I DON'T LIKE THAT CITY ANY MORE ET CETERA AND OF COURSE THYMERS IS GE SOME WONDERFUL REDEEMING FEATURES BUT IT ONLY TAKES ONE BAD INSANT IN ONE LOCATION TO CCOLOR THE WHOLE O PICTURE DARK SO TO SPEAK THE BRAIN WORKS THAT WAY THE BRAIN GENERALIZES IT IT'S NOT A VERY SPECIFIC ORGAN AGAIN ITS A PREDICTION MACHINE AN ADDITIONED OTHER THINGS SO IN THE CASE OF SEB TEE THERAPY THE REASON THERE'S HOME WORK IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE GO HOME OFTENTIMES THAT'S WHEN THEY RELAPSE IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT BACK INTO THEIR OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS AND THAT LOCATION THAT CONDITION PLACE IS WHERE IT BECOMES MOST IMPORTANT TO CHALLENGE THE ANXIETY AND TO DEAL WITH THE ANXIETY DID NOT TRY AND SUPPRESS THE ANXIETY THROUGH COMPULSIONS OR OTHER MEANS AND WHEN I SAY OTHER MEANS I WANT A HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING WHO COME UP AGAIN LO IT LATER IN THE PODCASTS THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS VERY COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH OSED BECAUSE OF THE ANXIETY COMPONENT AND ALSO BECAUSE OF PEOPLE'S FEELINGS THAT THEY JUST CAN'T ESCAPE FROM THE THOUGHTS OR BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS THAT ARE SO CHARACTERISTIC OF OSED SO ALCOHOL ABUSE OR CANABUS O BUSE OR OTHER FORMS OF NARCOTICS ABUSE AR VERY COMMON IN OSED LATER WILL TALK ABOUT WHETHE NOT CANABISTS CAN OR CANNOT HELP WITH OSED BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY SUPPRESSING ANXIETY IS EXACTLY THE WRONG DIRECTION THAT ONE SHOULD TAKE IF THE GOAL IS TO ULTIMATELY RELIEVE OR ELIMINATE THE OSED SO WE NOW HAVE TWO CHARACTERISTICS OF SEB T EXPOSURE THERAPY THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOROSEDY AND SOMEWHAT UNIQUE TO TO THE TREATMENT OF OSED AND THAT'S THE STAIRCASING UP TOWARDS THE REALLY BAD FEAR THE REALLY SEVERE AND SPECIFIC ARTICULATION AND UNDERSTANDING AND FEELING OF HOW BAD THINGS REALLY WOULD BE IF SOMEONE ENGAGED IN A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR OR AVOIDED OF PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR THEN THERE'S THE COMPONENT OF HOMEWORK GIVEN BY THE CLINITION FOR THE PERSON TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A BROADER SET OF CONTECTS IN WHICH THEY CAN DEAL WITH THE ANXIETY NOT ENGAGE IN THE COMPULSIONS AND THEN A VERY UNIQUE FEATURE OF TREATMENT OF OSED THAT YOU DON'T SEE IN MANY OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS OUR HOME VISITS I FIND THIS FASCINATING I THINK THAT THE FEEL OF PSYCHATRY AND PSYCHOLOGY TRADITIONALLY DOESN'T ALLOW FOR OR INVITE HOME VISITS BUT THIS COMPONENT OF CONTEXT LOCATION AN CONTECTS BEING SO VITAL TO THE TREATMENT AND RELIEF OF OSED HAS INSPIRED MANY PSYCHIATRIS AND PSYCOLOGISTS TO GET PERMISTION TO DO HOME VISITS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY GO VISIT THEIR PATIONTS IN THEIR NATIVE SETTING IN THEIR HOME CAGES RIGHT THEIRE NOT MICE BUT IN THEIR HOME HOME CAGES RIGHTEM BEING FACETIOUS HERE BUT PEOPLE MICE LIVING CAGES AT LEAST IN THE LABORATORY AND A HUMANS GENERALLY THAN HOUSES OR ELSEWHERE SO THEY VISIT THEM IN THEIR HOME IN ORDER TO SEE HOW THEY ARE INTERACTING AND THE PARTICULARY LOCATIONS THAT EVOKE THE MOST ANXIETY IN THE LEAST ANXIETIES SOME OF THE AND ONE TO CALL THEM CRUTSHES BUT SOME OF THE TOOLS TH T THAT PEOPLE ARE USING TO CONFRONT AND DEAL WITH THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS AND IN PARTICULAR TO TRY AND IDENTIFY SOME OF THE TOOLS AND TRICKS THAT PEOPLE ARE USING TO TRY AND AVOID THAT HEIGHTENED ANXIETY BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN AND I KNOW I'M REPEATING MYSELF BUT I THINK THIS IS JUST SO VITAL AND SO UNIQUE ABOUT OSEEDI IN THE TREATMENT OF OSEDY THE CRITICAL NEED FOR THE PATIEN TO BE ABLE TO TOLERATE EXTREMELY ELEVATED LEVELS OF ANXIETY IS SO CRUCIAL SO IF PEOPLE ARE AVOIDING CERTAIN ROOMS IN THE HOUSE OR IF PEOPLE ARE VOITING CERTAIN FOODS ARE CERTAIN LOCATIONS IN THE KITTION THE CLINITION CAN START TO IDENTIFY THAT BY MERE OBSERVATION AND I SHOULD MENTION HERE THAT PATIENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF HOW THEY ARE INTERACTING WITH THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENT SOME OF THESE PATTERNS ARE SO DEEPLY ENGRAINED IN PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEIR CONSTANTLY TURNING TO THE LAUGHTER THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEI'RE ONLY WASHING THEIR HANDS ON ONE SIE OF THE SANK AND SO THE CLINITION BY VISITING THE HOME CAN START TO INTERROGATE A BIT IN A POLITE WAY IN A FRIENDLY IN A SUPPORTIVE WAY AS TO DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHY YOU ALWAYS YOU KNOW FLIP THE FOSIT TO THE LAUGHTER FLIP THE FOSSIT TO THE RIGHT ET CETERA NOW WE ALL DO A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE HABITUAL WE ALL DO THINGS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT REGULAR FROM DAY TO DAY IN FACT I WOULD INVITE YOU TO ASK YOURSELF DO YOU ALWAYS PUT YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IN THE SAME LOCATION DO YOU ALWAYS CAP THE TOOTHBRUSH BEFORE AFTER USE IT WHAT SORTS OF THINGS YOU  WIPE THE THE LE UM THREADING ON THE TOOTHPACTE OR NOT I'M SOMEBODY I A CONFESS IT O I HAVE WILL I HAVE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT PEEVES BUT ONE MY PET THIEVESS ITS TOOTHPACE KIND OF ON THE THREAD OF THE THE TOOTHPACTE IT REALLY BOTHERS ME I DON'T KNOW WHY ALMOST AS MUCH AS TRY TO WIPE IT OFF BOTHERS ME WHICH CREATES A CERTAIN CHALLENGE AND IF I TALK ABOUT THIS ANY FURTHER THEN I THINK I WOULD QUALIFY FOR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER BUT I HAVE TO SAY I DON'T EXPERIENCE A TON OF ANXIETY ABOUT IT IT DOESN'T GOVERN MY LIFE IN FACT I REALIZE THAT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE TOBES OF TOOTHPACTE THAT HAVE TOOTHPASTES ALONG THE THREAD EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME I CAN STILL SIT HERE AND A PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT OSE D TO U IT'S NOT INTRUSIVE AT LEAST NOT TO MY AWARENESS SO BY THE HOME VISIT THE THERAPIST CAN REALLY START TO EXPLORE THROUGH DIRECT QUESTIONING AND CAN ALLOW THE PATIENT TO EXPLORE THROUGH DIRECT QUESTIONING OF THEMSELVES THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE CONSCIOUS OF AND THE THINGS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE CONSCIOUS OF THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR OSED SO I LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE KEY ELEMENTS OF COGNA BEHAVIORAL THERAPEAN EXPOSURE THERAPY AND HOW THEY CAN BE COMBINED WITH DRUG TREATMENTS THAT ARE VERY EFFECTIVE MUNCH OF WHAT I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEXT RELATES TO THE DATA AND INDEED THE CRACTISE OF AN INCREDIBLE RESEARCH SCIENTIST AND CLINITION SO THIS IS HELEN BLAIR SIM SIN THER I SHOULD S A DOCTOR HELLEN BLAER SIMPSON BECAUSE SHE IS INDEED AN EMTY MEDICAL DOCTOR AN  PH TO RESEARCH SCIENTISTS AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S FORM MOST EXPERTS IF NOT THE EXPERT WOULD PUT HER IN A CATEGORY OF MAY BE JUST ONE THE THREE PEOPLE WHO IS MOST KNOWLEDGIBLE ABOUT THE MECHANISMS OF O S D IS ACTIVELY RESEARCHING O S D IN HUMANS TRYING TO FIND NEW TREATMENTS TRIN UNVAIL NEW MECHANISMS AND EXPAND ON OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING AND WHO ALSO TREATS O S D QUITE ACTIVELY IN HER OWN CLINIC DOCTOR SIMPSON GAVE A BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION WHICH SHE SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE COOR ELEMENTS OF C B T AND EXPOSURE THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDERS SHE DSCRIBES THAT THE KEY PROCEDURES ARE EXPOSURES OF COURSE DONE IN PERSON AND WITH THE ACTUAL THING THAT EVOKES THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS SO THIS COULD BE THE SWEATY TOWEL AS DESCRIBED EARLIER OR COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TRIGGERS DONE WITH THE PATIENT IN REAL TIME SO IN VIVO AS WE SAY AND IT COULD ALSO BE THINGS THAT ARE IMAGINAL SITTING SOMEBODY DOWN IN A CHAIR AN AN OFFICE AN SAYING OKA I WANTS YOU TO IMAGINE THE THING THAT TRIGGERS THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHT OR THES JUST FOCUS ON THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHT AS IT ARISES AND THAN TO EXPLORE AND EXPOSED THE PATIENT TO THEIR OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS THAT WAY SO CAN BE REAL OR CAN BE IMAGINAL AND THE GOAL OF COURSE THEN IS TO GRADUALLY AND PROGRESSIVELY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY BUT THAN TO INTERVENE AND SO CALLED RITUAL PROVENTIEN TO PREVENT THE PERSON FROM ENGAGING IN THE COMPULSION THE GOALS AGAIN ON PARAPHRASING HERE ARE TO A SHE STATES DISCONFIRM FEARES AND CHALLENGE THE BELIEFS ABOUT THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS TOT INTERVENE IN THE THOUGHTS AND THE BEHAVIORS AND TO BREAK THE HABIT OF RITUALIZING AND AVOIDING NOW HOW IS THIS TYPICALLY DONE WHAT IT WHAT ARE THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF THIS PROCEDURE TYPICALLY THIS IS DONE THROUGH TWO PLANNING SESSIONS WITH THE PATIENT SO DESCRIBING TO THE PATIENT WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN AND HOW LONG IT WILL HAPPEN SO THAT ARE NOT JUST THROWN INTO THIS OUT OF THE BLUE AND THEN FIFTEEN EXPOSURE SESSIONS DONE TWICE A WEEK OR MORE SO THE ONE THING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT COGNA BEHAVIORAL THERAPY IS THAT IT CAN TAKE SOME PERIOD OF TIMES SEVERAL OR MORE WEEKS AS MANY AS TEN OR TWELVE WEEKS HOWEVER AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN MANY OF THE DRUG TREATMENTS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING OSED EITHER ALONG OR IN COMMINATION WITH BEHAVIOUR OLTHERAPIES ALSO CAN TAKE EIGHT TEN TWELVE WEEKS OR LONGER AND MANY OF THOSE NEVER WORK AT ALL SO EVEN THOUGH TEN TO TWELVE WEEK SEEMS LIKE A LONG PERIOD OFE TIME USSUE PRETTY STANDARD IF YOU LIKE TO SEE MORE COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCALS FOR COGNA BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY AND EXPOSURE THERAPY FOR OS D I'LL PROVIDE LINKS TO TWO PAPERS COSAC AND FO F O A WHICH IS PUBLISHD IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHICH MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LONG TIME AGO BUT NONE THE LESS THAT THE PROTOCULS ARE STILL VERY USEFUL AND THEN THE SECOND PAPER IS BY THAT LAST OLTHEIR FO AT ALL IN TWENTY TWELVE WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO BOTH OF THOSE IN ADDITION DOCTOR BLAIR SIMPSON AND OTHERS HAVE EXPLORED WHAT ARE THE BEST TREATMENTS FOR PATIONTS WITH OC D BY COMPARING CO OF BEHAVIOROLTHERAPY ALONE PLASEBO SO ESSENTIY NO INTERVENTION WER SOMETHING THAT TAKES AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF TIME BUT IS NOT THOUGHT TO BE EFFECTIVE IN TREATMENT AS WELL AS SELECTIVE CERATONAN REUP TAKEN HIBITERS SO WHAT IS AN ECESARI AN ECESSORI IS A DRUG THAT PREVENTS THE REUPTAKE OF CERATONAN AT THE SYNAPS WHAT AR SYNAPSES THER THE LITL SPACES BETWEEN NURONS WERE NURONS COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER BY VOMITING LITTLE BITS OF CHEMICAL INTO THE SPACE THE YNAPS AND THEN THOSE CHEMICALS EITHER EVOKE OR SUPPRESS THE ELECTRICALECTIVITY OF THE NEXNERON ACROSS THE SYNAPS AND ITHIS CASE THE NORTRANSMITTER THE CHEMICAL THAT WERE REFERRING TO I SERATONAN S S OR IS SELECTIVE CRATONAN REUPTAKEN HIBITORS PREVENT THE REUPTAKE OF THE CHEMICAL THAT'S LEFT THISCASE THE ERATONAN THAT'S LEFT IN THE SYNAPS AFTER THAT I CALL IT VOMITING TO BE DRAMATIC BUT IT'S NOT ASHY AVOMINING THE EXTRUSION OF THE CHEMICAL INTO THE SYNAPS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE'S MORE CERATONAN AROUND TO HAVE MORE OF AN EFFECT OVER TIME THENETEFFECT BEING MORE CERATORNURGIC TRANSMISSION MORE CERATONAN OVER ALL SO NOT MORE CERATONAN BEING MADE MORE CERATONAN BEING OF VAILABLE FOR USE THAT'S WHAT ANECESSORIDEAS SO THEY COMPARED COGNA BEHAVIOROTHERAPY ESESSORISE THEY ALSO THE PLOCIBO GROUP AND THE HAD COGNI BEHAVIORALTHERAPY PLUS THE SELECTIVE CERATONAN REUPTAKEN HIBITOR THIS WAS A TWELVE WEEKS STUDY DONE AS DESCRIBED BEFORE R TWO TIMES A WEEK OVER THE COURSE OF TWELVE WEEKS FIRST OF ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF COURSE PLAEBO DID NOTHING IT DID NOT RELIEVE THE OSEDI TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE RIGHT HOW DID THEY KNOW THAT THEY GAVE THEM THE WIBOX TEST THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE WIT THE YALE BROWN TEST WITH ALL THOSE QUESTIONS OF WHICH I READ A FEW SO THE OCEDY SEVERITY THAT ONE HAS TO HAVE ON THE WIBOX IS MEASURED IN TERMS OF AN INDEX THAT GOES ANY HERE FROM EIGHT ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY EIGHT THAT SHOULDN'T MEAN ANYTHINGS OF THAT NUMBER EIGHT AS KIND OF MEANINGLESS HERITS AND TERMS OF AN INDEXTHETONY ONLY MEANING FOR THE WIBOX BUT IF SOMEBODY HAS A THRESHOLD OF SIXTEEN OR HIGHER IT MEANS THAT THEY STILL HAVING SOMEWHAT DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS ARE VERY DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS PLACEBO DID NOT REDUCE THE OBSESSIONS OR COMPULSIONS TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE HOWEVER AND I THINK QUITE EXCITINGLY COGNI BEHAVIORALTHERAPY HAD A DRAMATIC EFFECT IN REDUCING THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS SUCH THAT BY FOUR WEEKS THAT SCORE THAT IN THIS CASE RANGE FROM EIGHT TO TWENTY EIGHT DROPPED ALL THE WAY FROM TWENTY FIVE DOWN TO ABOUT ELEVEN SO'S A HUGE DROP IN THE SEVERITY OF THE SYMPTOMS NOW WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EFFECTS OF ESSESSORIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF OSEDI SYMPTOMS THEY HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS OF OSE D THAT SHOWED UP FIRST AT FOUR WEEKS AND THEN CONTINUED TO EIGHT WEEKS IN FACT HERE WAS A PROGRESSIVE AND FURTHER REDUCTION IN OSE D SYMPTOMS FROM THE FOUR TO EIGHT WEEK PERIOD AGAIN THESE OFE THE PEOPLE JUST TAKING THE ESSESSORI AND THEN IT SORT FLATTENED OUT O LIL BIT SUCH BY TWELVE WEEKS THERE WASE STILL A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OSED SYMPTOMS FOR PEOPLE TAKING ASCESSORISE AS COMPARED TO PLOCIBO BUT THE SEVERITY THEIR SYMPTOMS WAS STILL MUCH GREATER THAN THOSE RECEIVING COGNA BEHAVIOR ALTHERAPY ALONE SO AT LEAST IN THIS STUDY AND I SHOULD TELL YOU WHICH STUDY IT IS THIS THIS FO LIBOUETS AT ALL TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN THE AMERICAN GERNAL PSYCHATRI WILL ALSO PROVIDED LIN TO THIS  CAN PERUSE THE DATA IF YOU LIKE BUT LEAST IN THIS STUDY COGNA BEHAVIOR OTHERAPY WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE SELECTIVE SARATONA REUPTAKEN HIITERS LESS EFFECTIVE SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COMBIND THEM WHILE THEY EXPLORE THAT IS WELL AND THE COMMINATION OF COGNA BEHAVOROTHERAPY AND THE ACESSORISE TOGETHER DIDN NOT LEAD TO ANY FURTHER DEECREASE IN OSED SYMPTOMS THIS POINT TO THE IDEA THAT COGNAN BEHAVIOR OTHERAPY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND GAIN WHEN I SAY COGNA BEHAVIOR OTHERAPY NOW I AM STILL REFERRING TO COGNA BEHAVIORAL SLASH EXPOSURE THERAPY DONE IN THE WAY THAT I DETAIL BEFORE TWICE A WEEK FOR TWELVE WEEKS OR MORE SO ALL OF THE DATE AT LEAST IN THIS STUDY POINT TO THE FACT THAT COGNAN BEHAVIOROTHERAPY IS REALLY EFFECTIVE AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE DOES IT ALLEVIATE OSED SYMPTOMS FOR EVERYBODY NO IS IT VERY TIME CONSUMING YES TWICE A WEEK FOR O YOU KNOW TWO SESSIONS OR MORE OF FIFTEEN MINUTES SOMETIMES IN THE OFFICE PLUS THERS HOMEWORK PLUS THER CAN IN AN IDEAL CASE THERES ALSO HOME VISITS FROM THE PSYCHATRIST OR PSYCHOLOGIST THATS A LOT OF INVESTMENT A LOT OF TIME INVESTMENT TO SAY NOTHING OF THE PETENTIAL FINANCIAL INVESTMENT NOW DOCTOR BLAIR SYMPSON HAS GIVEN SOME BEAUTIFUL TALKS WHERE SHE DESCRIBES THESE DATA AND ALSO EMPHASIZE IS THE FACT THAT DESPITE THE DEMONSTRATED POWER OF COGNA BEHAVIORALTHERAPY FOR THE TREATMEN OF OSED MOST PEOPLE ARE GIVEN DRUG TREATMENT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE TRUG TREATMENTS NOW WHEN I SAY MOST PEOPLE WANT TO EMPHASIZED THAT IM REFERRING TO MOST PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY GO SEEK TREATMENT CAUS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE IS THAT MOST PEOPLE OT O S D DO NOT ACTUALLY GO SEEK EVIDENT SPASE TREATMENT ON A REPEAT THAT MOST PEOPLE OFT O SE D DO NOT SEEK EVIDENTS BASE TREATMENT WHICH IS A TRAGIC THING ONE OF THE MOTIVATIONS FOR DOING THIS PODCAST EPISODE IS TO TRY AN ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY MAY HAVE PERSISTENT OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS TO SEEK TREATMENT BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T FOR VARIETY OF REASONS WE SPELLED OUT EARLIER SHAME ET CETERA OF THOSE THAT DO THE FIRST SLINE OF ATTACK IS TYPICALLY A PRESCRIPTION MOST OFTEN AN ACESSARI ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS JUST AS ESARISE BECAUSE SHON WILL TALK ABOUT O THE SOMEWHAT COMMON USE OF ALSO PRESCRIBING A LO DOSE OF A NERALEPTIC OR AN ANTISYCHOTIC NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN SO THE IMPORTANTHINGS UNDER STAND HERE IS THAT EXCELLENT RESEARCHERS LIKE DOCTOR SYMPSON UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THERE ARE TREATMENTS THAT WE COULD SAY ARE BEST ORA ARE IDEAL BASED ON THE DATA THAT DOESN'T NECESARILY MEAN THATS WHAT'S BEING DEPLOYED MOST OFTEN IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS A CONSEQUENCE DOCTOR SIMPSON ANOTHERS HAVE EXPLORED IN A VERY PRACTICAL WAY WHETHER NOT IT MATTERS IF SOMEBODY IS GETTING ESSESSORI TREATMENT AND IS EXPERIENCING THAT REDUCTION IN OSEDI SYMPTOMS THAT AS YOU MAY RECALL IS MORE THAN WHAT THEY WOULD EXPERIENCE WITH PLOCIBO ALONE BUT NOT AS DRAMATIC OF REDUCTION IN OSEDY SYMPTOMS AS THEY WOULD GET WITH COGNA BEHAVORAL THERAPY AND AS I MENTION BEFORE THER WAS THIS EXPLORATION OF COMBINING DRUG TREATMEN COGNA BEHAVIORALTHERAPY FROM THE OUTSET BUT THEY ALSO QUITE IMPRESSIVELY EXPLORED WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY TAKING ASESSORSE INITIATE COGNAOF BEHAVIORALTHERAPY THIS IS A REALLY WONDERFUL THING THAT THEY'VE DONE THIS BECAUSE IN DOING THAT FIRST OF ALL THEIR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THER WHO HAVE SOUGHT TREATMENT AND ARE GETTING SOME RELIEF FROM THOSE ESSORISE BUT IT PERHAPS IS NOT AS MUCH RELIEF AS THEY COULD GET AND THEY ARE ACTIVELY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING THESE DRUG TREATMENTS FIRST IN FACT MOST OFTEN PEOPLE GAIN THESE DRUGTREATMENTS FIRST SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD IN COGNO BEHAVIORALTHERAPY WHILE THE GOD NEWS IS WHEN YOU ADD COGNAF BEHAVIOR ALTHERAPY TO SOME ONE WHOSE ALREADY TAKING ASCESSORISE THAT FURTHER IMPROVES THEIR SYMPTOMS NOW THAT'S DIFFERENT THEN THE RESULTS THAT I DESCRIBE BEFORE FROM THE SAME LABORATORY IN FACT THAT IF YOU COMBINE COGNOF BEHAVIOR ALTHERAPY WITH ESSESSORISED FROM THE OUTSET THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF ASCESSOR HOWEVER AS I JUST DESCRIBED IF SOME ONE IS ALREADY TAKING AN ASCESSORI AND THEIR EXPERIENCING A REDUCTION IN THEIR OSEDI SYMPTOMS BY ADDING IN COGNAOF BEHAVIORALTHERAPY THERE IS A FURTHER REDUCTION IN THE SYMPTOMS OF OSED THIS VERY IMPORTANT SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE SOUGHT TREATMENT IN YOUR TAKING A ASSESSRI OR IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TREATMENT AND YOUR PRESCRIBED IN ASSESSORI THE IDEALSONARA REALLY WOULD BE THE COMBINE THE DRUG TREATMENT WITH COGNI BEHAVORALTHERAPY OR IN SOME CASES MAY BE COGNO BEHAVIORALTHERAPY ALONE ALTHOUGH THAT'S A DECISION THAT YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE WITH THE CLOSE ADVICE AND OVERSIT OF OF A LICENSE O PHYSICIAN BECAUSE OF COURSE THES AR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND ANY TIME YOU'R GING TO ADD OR REMOVE A PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR CHANGE DOSE AT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THAT IN CLOSE DISCUSSION WITH AND ON THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN OWD TO SAY THAT TO PROTECT ME I SAY THAT T O PROTECT YOU AND CAS JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO SO AGAIN COGNOF BEHAVIOROL THERAPY IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL DRUG TREATMENTS SEEM LESS POWERFUL THOUGH IF YOUR ALREADY ON A DRUG TREATMENT ADING COGN BEHAVIORALTHERAPY CAN REALLY HELP SO IVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ESESSORISES ON DESCRIBED A LILE BIT ABOUT HOW THEY WORK AT A COND OF SUPERFICIAL LEVEL OF KEEPING MORE SERATONAN IN THE SYNAP SO THAT MORE SHERATONAN CAN BE IN ACTION AS OPPOSED TO GOBBLED BACK UP BY THOSE NURONS I SHOULD JIST MENTION WHAT SOME OF THE SELECTOV SERATONAND REUP TIC INHIBITORS ARE SO THINGS LIKE AM CLOMIPROMING AM WHICH IS NOT ENTIRELY SELECTIVE I SHOULD SAY THAT THAT ONE GENERALLY FALLS INTO A CATEGORY OF LESS SELECTIVE SO IT CAN IN PAIR OR I OR CAN ENHANCE SOME OF THE OTHER NUR TRANSMITTER NOR MODULATOR SYSTEMS LIKE EPINEPERAN ET CETERA THE SELECTIVE CERATONAN REUP TAKEN HIBITERS OR LEAST THE CLASSIC ONES ARE FLUOXITINE PROZAC FLUVOXIMINE FLUVOX PAROXITINE SERTRELINE CETALOPRAM ET CETERA ET CETERA THEYARE ABOUT SIX OR CLASSIC ESCESSORISE SOME OF THEM LIKE CETALOPRAM ARE USED IN CHILDREN AND AURE VEILABLE INPEDIATRIC DOSES SOME LIKE PROZAC MAYOR MAY NOT BE USED IN CHILDREN THE DETAILS OF WHICH ESESERISE ON ET CETERA IS A VERY EXTENSIVE LITERATURE AND DISCUSSION AN I THINK ITS SAFE TO SAY THAT WHICH DRUGS TO USE AND AT WHICH DOSAGE IN WHETHER NOT TO CONTAIN CONTINUES CUSE ME THE SAME DOSAGE OVER TIME DEPENDS A LOT ON THE INDIVIDUAL VARIATION THAT PEOPLE EXPRESS AND THE RESPONSES THAT THEY HAVE ALL OF THESE DRUGS IN FACT I THINK WE CAN SAY ALL DRUGS HAVE SIDE EFFECIES THE QUESTION IS HOW DETRIMENTAL THOUGH SIDE EFFECTS ARE TO DAILY LIFE THE ECESSERISE ARE WELL KNOWN TO HAVE EFFECTS ON APPETITE IN SOME CASES THEY ABOLISH APPETITE IN SOME CASES THEY JUST REDUCE A LITTLE BUT IN SOME CASES THEY INCREASE APPETITE LEAS HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL THEY CAN HAVE EFFECTS ON LEBIDO FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN REDUCE SEX DRIVE DEPEND IN SOMETIMES IN THE DOSE DEPENDENT WAY SOMETIMES IN A WAY THAT'S MORE LIKE A STEP FUNCTION WHERE PEOPLE ARE FINE AT SAY FIVE OR TEN MILIGRAMS BUT THEN THEY GET TO FIFTEEN MELEGRAMS AND THERE IS A CLIFF A FOR THEIR LIBIDO AN THAT CAN HAPPEN IT REALLY DEPENDS A PLEASE DON'T TAKE THOSE DOSAGES AS EXACT VALUES CASES IS GOING TO DEPEND ON  WHAT THEY'RE BEING USED FOR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY OR OSID AND IT'S ALSO GEEN DEPEND ON THE DRUG ET CETERA JUST THROUGHOUT THOSE NUMBERS AS A WAY TO ON ILLUSTRATE WHAT A AKIND OF A STEP FUNCTION WOULD LOOK LIKE IT'S NOT GRADUAL ITS IMMEDIATE AT A GIVEN DOSE IS WHAT THAT MEANS THE OTHER THING IS THAT SOME OF THESE DRUGS WILL HAVE TRANSIENT EFFECTS SO SIDEEFFECTS THAT SHOW UP AND THEN DISAPPEAR OR SADLY PEOPLE WILL SOMETIMES TAKE THESE DRUGS FOR WHILD TEN SIDE EFFECTS WILL SURFACE LATER THAT WEREN'T THEIR A PREVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON LIFE FACTORS NUTRICIAN FACTOR SO ITS A VERY COMPLICATED LANDSCAPE OVER ALL AND THAT'S WHITES REALLY IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE ANY KIND OF DRUG TREATMENT ECESSORI OR OTHERWISE REALLY IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE PSYCHIATRIST WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE FARM O CANATICS AND HAS A LOT OF PATIENT HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE WITH THEM SO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOUNEXTS IS MOST CERTAINLY GON TO COME AS A BIG SURPRISE WHICH IS THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SELECTIVE CERETONEAN REUPTAKE IN HIBITORS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS OF OSIDI AT LEAST SOMEWHAT AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN PLICIBO THERE IS VERY LITTLE IF ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE CERETONEAN SYSTEM IS DESRUPTED IN OSIDI AND I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A SOMEWHAT CONSISTENT THEME IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY THAT IS A GIVEN DRUG CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE OR EVEN PARTIALLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING SYMPTOMS OR IN CHANGING THE OVERALL LANDSCAPE OF A PSYCI TRIC DISORDER OR ILLNESS AND YET THERE IS VERY LITTLE IF ANY EVIDENCE THAT THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM IS WHAT'S CAUSAL FOR O C D OR ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION ET CETERA THIS IS JUST THE LANDSCAPE THAT WERE LIVING IN IN TERMS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BRAIN AND PSYCHIATRY IN THE WAYS OF TREATING BRAIN DISORDERS SO AS A CONSEQUENCE THERD A HUGE NUMBER OF ACADEMIC REVIEWS THAT CLINITIONS IN RESEARCH SCIENTISTS HAVE GENERATED AND READ AND SHERE ONE OF THE MOR I THINK A THOROUGH ONES IN RECENT YEARS WAS PUBLISHIN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS THIS IS BY AN EXCELLENT TRULY EXCELLENT RESEARCHER FROM YELL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE I SHOUS AT NOTCHOUS A RESEARCHER BU THE CLINITIAN PSCIENTISTS AGAIN AND MD P H D THIS IS O CHRISTOPHER PITANTER AND THE CITLO OF THE REVIEW IS FARMER GO THE PARMICO THERAPUTIC STRATEGIES AND NEW TARGETS IN O C D AND AGAIN IT WILL PRIDE PROVIDE LINK TO IT HAS THIS IS A JUST GORGEOUS REVIEW DESCRIBING AS I JUST TOLD YOU THAT THE CERATONAN SYSTEM ISN'T REALLY DESRUPTED IN O C D AND YET ESCESSORISE CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE THE REVIEW GOES ON TO TO EXPLORE EVEN WHAT SORTS OF RECEPTORS FOR CERATONAN MIGHT BE INVOLVED IF ITS IN FACT THE CASE THAT CERATONAN IS A A CULPRIT IN THE CREATION OF OC D SYMPTOMS A TALK ABOUT THE SRATNAN TOA RECEPTOR AND THE CERATONE ONE A RESEPTER WHYMI MENTIONING ALL THAT DETAIL IF IN FACT IT'S NOT CLEAR SERATON IS INVOLVED BECAUSE I'LL JUST TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THERE IS CURRENTLY A LOT OF INTEREST IN WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THESE PSYCHODELICS IN PARTICULAR SCYLICIBEN CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF O C D SYLICIBEN HAS BEEN SHOWN IN VARIOUS CLINICAL TRIALS IN PARTICULARTHE CLINICAL TRIALS DONE AT JOHN'S HOPKINS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE BY MATTHEW JOHNSON AND OTHERS MATTHEW AS ON THE HUBRMAN LABPODCAS HE'S BEEN ON THE TENPHARISPODCAS HE'S BEEN ON THE LEX'S FREEDMAN PODCAS THE WORLD CLASS RESEARCHER ON THE USE OF PSYCHODELICS FOR DEPRESSION AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES AND THERE SYLICIAN TREATMENT HAS BEEN SEEN AT LEAST IN THOSE TRIALS TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN TE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN KINDS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION CURRENTLY THE EXPLORATION OF CYLICIBEN FOR THE TREATMENT OF O C D HAS NOT YIELDED SIMILAR RESULTSO THOUG THE STUDIES ARE ON GOING AGAIN HAS NOT YIELDED SIMILAR EFFECTIVENESS BUT THE STUDIES ARE ON GOING AND THE CERATONAN TOA RECEPTOR AND THE CRATONAN ONE A RECEPTORS ARE PRIMARY TARGETS FOR THE DRUG SYLICIVEN I FIGUE THERE WERE GON O BE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER NOT PSYCHODELIC'S HELP WITH O C D A THUS FAR ITS IN CONCLUSIVE IF ANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF CLINICAL TRIALS OR HAVE KNOWLEDGE OR INTUITION ABOUT THIS A RELATIONSHIP OR POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIP I SHOULD SAY BETWEEN SYLICIVON OR OTHE PSYCHODELIS AND O C D PLEASE PUT THEM IN THE COMMENT SECTION WE LOVE TO LOVE TO HEAR A FROM YOU A ONE THING I SHALL POINT OU IS THAT EVEN THOUGH CRATONAN HAS NOT BEEN DIRECTLY IMPLICATED IN O C D CERATONAN AND THE GENERAL SYSTEMS OF CERATON AND THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT CARYCERATONAN AND DEPEND ON IT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPACT COD NITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND INFLEXIBILITY WHICH ARE KIND OF HOLE MARK THEMES OF OSED SO IN ANIMALS THAT HAVE THEIR CERATONAN DEPLEATED OR INHUMANS THAT HAVE VERY LOW LEVELS OF CERATONAN YOU CAN SEE EVIDENCE OF COGNIVE INFLEXIBILITY CHALLENGES IN TASKS WHICH IN CHALLENGES IN SWITCHING THE RULES BY WHICH ONE PERFORMS A GAME CHALLENGES IN ANY KIND OF OR COGNITIVE DOMAIN SWITCHING AND SO THAT DOES INDIRECTLY IMPLICATE A SRATONAN IN SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF OSED AGAIND WHEN ONE STARTS TO EXPLORE THE DIFFERENT TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLORED IN ANIMAL MODELS AND INHUMANS IT'S A VAST VAST LANDSCAPE BUT SERATONERGIC DRUGS DO SEEM TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE DRUGS IN TREATING OSED DESPITE THE FACT AGAINT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT THEIR ATONAN SYSTEMS OR THE PROBLEM IN OSED IF YOU RECALL THE CORTICO STRIDO THILAMIC LOOP THAT IS SO SENTRAL TO THE EDEOLOGY THE PRESENTS AND THE THE PATTERNS OF SYMPTEMS IN SED OF COURSE CERATONAN IS IMPACTING THAT SYSTEM SERATONAS IMPACTING JUST ABOUT EVERY SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT TINKERING WITH CERATONAN LEVEL SPECIFICALLY IN THAT NET WORK IS WHAT'S LEADING TO THE IMPROVEMENTS IN OSED HOWEVER IF PEOPLE GO IN TO EPHEMORI SCANNER AND THOSE PEOPLE HAVE OSED AND THEY EVOKE THE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS YOU SEE ACTIVITY IN THAT CORTICO STRIDOTHYLAMIC LOOP TREATMENTS LIKE ESSESSORISE THAT REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS OF OSED EQUATE TO  SITUATION WHERE THERE IS LESS ACTIVITY IN THAT LOOP AND I SHOULD POINT OUT COGNIVE BEHAVIORALTHERAPY WHICH WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE ONLY TAPS INTO THE SERATONAN SYSTEM IGHT THINK IT WOULD BE EXTREME STRATUA WOULD BE FALSE ACTUALLY TO SAY THAT THE COGNA BEHAVOR AL THERAPY TAPS ONLY INTO THE SERATONAN SYSTEM CLEARLY ITSTEM OF FACT A HUGE NUMBER OF CIRCUITS AND NOR CHEMICAL SYSTEMS WELL PEOPLE DO COGNA BEHAVIORALTHERAPY AND FIND SOME RELIEF FOROSD THEY ALSO SHOW REDUCTIONS IN THOSE CORTICO STRIDALTHYLAMIC LOOPS SO BASICALLY WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A BEHAVIORALTHERAPY THAT WORKS IN MANY PEOPLE NOT ALL AND WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF ABOUT WYIT WORKS IT INCREASES ANXIE TY TOLERANCE AND INTERFERENCE WITH PATTERN EXECUTION GETTING PEOPLE TO NOT ENGAGE IN THE SAME SORTS OF BEHAVIORS THAT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO THEM AND WE HAVE DRUG TREATMENTS THAT WORK AT LEAST TO SOME DEGREE BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WORK OR WHERE THEY WORK IN THE BRAIN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY UNIFIES THE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS AND THE DRUG TREATMENTS IS THAT THEY TAKE SOME PERIOD OF TIME SOME RELIEF FROM SYMPTEM SEEMS TO SHOW UP AROUND FOUR WEEKS AND CERTAINLY BY EIGHT WEEKS FOR BOTH COGNA BEHAVIOR OLTHERAPY AND THE ESSESSORISE BUT IT'S REALLY AT THE TEN TO TWELVE WEEK STAGE WHEN SOME ONE'S BEEN DOING THESE TWICE A WEEK COGNI BEHAVIORAL SECTIONS THEY BEEN TAKING A ESSESSORI FOR TEN TO TWELVE WEEKS THAT THE REALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OSED SYMPTEMS STARTS TO REALLY SHOW UP NOW PUN TILL NOW IHAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING RELIEF FROM THESE TREATMENTS BUT SADLY IN THE CASE OF OCED THERE IS A SIGNIFICAN POPULATION THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT RESPOND TO C B T OR TO ESCESSORIZE OR TO THEIR COMMINATION WHICH IS WHY CYCHITRIS ALSO EXPLORE THE COMMINATION OF ECESSORIZE AND NEURILEPTICS OR DRUGS THAT TAP IN TO THE SO CALLED DOPOMINE SYSTEM OR THE GLUDIMATE SYSTEM THESE ARE OTHER NEROTRANSMITTERS IN NUROMODULATORS THAT IMPACTIFERAN CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND JUST TO REALLY REMIND YOU WHAT NERO TRANSMITTERS AN NEROMODULATORS DO BECAUSE THE IS IMPORTANT TO CONTEXTRUALIZE ALL THIS NOR TRANSMITTERS ARE TYPICALLY INVOLVED IN THE RAPID COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NURONS AND THE TWO MOST COMMONAROTRANSMITTERS FOR THAT ARE THE NUR TRANSMITTER LUDIMATE WHICH WE SAY AS EXCITATORY MEANING WHEN ITS RELEASED INTO THE ENAPS IT CAUSES THA NEXT NERON TO BE MORE ACTIVE OR ACTIVE AND GABA WHICH IS A NEUROTRANSMITTER THAT IS INHIBATORY MEANING WHEN ITS RELEASED INTO THE ENAPS TYPICALLY NOT ALWAYS BUT TIPICALLY THAT GABA IS GOING TO ENCOURAGE THE NEXT NURON TO BE LESS ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE REVEN SILENCE ITS ACTIVITY THE NEURO MODULATORS BY CONTRASTS O NOTNOR TRANSMITTERS BUT NUROMODULATORS LIKE DOPOMINE CERATONAN EPINEPERAN AN A SETOCOLING AND OTHERS OPERATE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THEY INTEND TO ACT ALUMIT MORE BROADLY THEY CAN ACT WITHIN THE SENAPS BUT THEY CAN ALSO CHANGE THE GENERAL PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN MAKING CERTAIN CIRCUITS MORE LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE AN OTHER CIRCUITS LESS LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE SO WHEN WE SAY YOU KNOW DOPOMINE DOES ACTS OR DOPOMING DOES WHY AR CERTONAN DOES EXERCERTON NOES WHY THEY DON'T REALLY DO ONE THING THEY CHANGE THE SORT OF OVERALL TONALITY THEY MAKE IT MORE LIKELY OR LESS LIKELY THAT CERTAIN CIRCUITS WILL BE ACTIVE YUN THINK OF THEM AS KIND OF ACTIVATING PLAYLESS OR JEONRAS OF ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN A RATHER THEN ON BEING INVOLVED IN THE SPECIFIC COMMUNICATION ARE SPECIFIC SONGS IF YOU WILL IN THES ANALOGY OR DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN PARTICULAR NURONS SO WHEN WE HEAR THAT ESCESSORIZE INCREASE CERATONAN AND REDUCE SYSTYMPTEMS OF OC D OR A NEUROLEPTIC REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE AND MAKES PEOPLE FEEL CALMER FOR INSTANCE OR CAN REMOVE SOME ON STEREOTYPE REPETIVE MOT MOTOR BEHAVIOR WHICH THEY CAN EITHER GENERATE OR REDUCE MOTOR BEHAVIOR IT TURNS OUT SO WHEN I SAY THAT WHAT 'M REFERRING TO IS THE FACT THAT THESE NEUROMODULATORS ARE OF TURNING UP THE VOLUME ON CERTAIN CIRCUITS AND TURNING DOWN THE VOLUME ON OTHER CIRCUITS I SAY THAT BECAUSE IF YOU ARE GOING TO EXPLORE DRUG TREATMENTS AGAIN WITH TA LICENSE PHYSICION IF YOU'RE GOING TO EXPLORE DRUG TREATMENTS FOR OC D AND IN PARTICULAR IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING RESULTS FROM ESESSORIES OR YOU'RE NOT GETTING RESULTS FROM COGNA BEHAVIORAL THERAPY OR THE CIDIFECT PROFILES OF THE DRUGS THAT YOURE TAKING FOROC D ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THEM WELL THEN IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT ANY TIME YOU TAKE ONE OF THESE DRUGS THEIRE NOT ACTING SPECIFICALLY ON THE CORTICO STRIATAL PHYLAMIC CIRCUIT THAT WILL BE WONDERFUL THAT'S THE FUTURE OF PSYCHIATRY BUT AS NOW WHEN YOU TAKE A DRUG IT ACYSTEMICALLY SO IT'S IMPACTING CARATONINYOUR GOT ITS ALSO IM PACKING CERATONE AN ANOTHERIS OF THE BRAIN HENCE THE EFFECTS ON THINGS LIKE DIGESTION OR LEBIDO OR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENTINGS THAT CARATONAN IS INVOLVED IN LIKEWISE IF YOU TAKE A NERALEPTIC LIKE HOW A PARADOL OR SOMETHING THAT REDUCES DOPOMIN TRANSMISSION WELL THEN IT'S GON TO HAVE SOME MOTOR EFFECTS CAS DOPEMEAN IS INVOLVED IN THE GENERATION OF MOTOR SEQUENCES AND SMOOTH LIMB MOVEMENT AS I PEOPLE WITH PARKENSENS WHO DON'T HAVE MUCH DOPEMING WILL GET A RESTING TREMOR AVE A HARTIME GENERING SMOTH MOVEMENT AND SO THE THE SIDE EFFECTSTARE TO MAKE SENSE GIVEN THE HUGE NUMBER OF DFFENT NERAL CIRCUITS THAT THESE DIFFERENT NOR MODULATORS ARE INVOLVED IN I DON'T SAY THAT TO BE DISCOURAGING I SAY THAT TO ENCOURAGE PATIENCE AND CAREFUL SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION OF DIFFERENT DRUG TREATMENTS FOR OSE D ALWAYS AGAIN WITH THE CAREFUL AND CLOSE GUIDANCE AND OVERSITE OF A PSYCHATRIS BECAUSE CYACHATRIS REALLY UNDERSTAND WHICH SIDE EFFECT PROFILES MAKE IT LIKELY THAT YOU CAN OR CANNOT OR WILL NEVER OR MAYBE SOME DAY WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE A GIVEN DRUG AT A GIVEN DOSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT REALLY HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE THIS IS NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU WANT A COWBOY AND GO TRINE FIGURE OUT YOURSELF NOW I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF DRUG TREATMENTS WE TOUCHED ON SILICIVEAN BRIEFLY BUT THEREARE OTHER FORMS OF DRUG TREATMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLORED FOR OC D EARLIER WE TALK TO LOBID ABOUT CANABAS WHY WOULD CANABAS BE A PLACE OF EXPLORATION AT ALL WELL FIRST OF ALL A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THINE SELP MEDICATE FOR OSE D THERE IS SOME CLINICAL EVIDENCE I AM NOT TIME OUT RECREATIONAL USEON LY ABOUT CLINICAL EVIDENCE THAT CANABAS CAN REDUCE ANXIETY EARLIER WEARE TALKING AOUT NOT REDUCING ANXIETY BUT LEARNING ANXIETY TOLERANCE IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH AND TREAT OCE D IN THE CONTECT OF COGNAN BEHAVRIAL THERAPIES THAT DOESN'T AS SARELY RULE OUT CANABAS AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF OSCE D AN IN FACT THIS HAS BEEN EXPLORED A STUDY FROM DOCTOR BLARSIMPSON HERSELF LOOKED AT THIS THIS WAS A FAIRLY SMALL SCALE STUDY SO FORSTOF ALL GOUVE BEU THE TITLE AND AGAIN WILL PROVIDE A LINK THIS IS ENTITLED A CUTE EFFECTS OF CANABONOIDS ON SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSIF COMPULSIVE DISORDER  HUMAN LABORATORY STUDY VERY BRIEFLY THIS WAS FOURTEEN ADULTS WITH OC D THEY HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH CANABAS THIS WAS RANDAMIZE PLACIBO CONTROLD THE CANABAS WAS SMOKED AM THEY AD DIFFERENT VARIETOLS AS THEY'RE CALLED THEY HAD A PLACIBO SO THIS IS BASICALLY A A A CONDITION IN WHICH CERTAIN SUBJECTS AM CONSUMED A CIGARETTE THAT HAD ZERO PERCENT T H C OTHERS HAD SEVEN PER CENT T H C OTHER GROUP STUDIES OR UM SOME HAD POINT FOUR PER CENT C B D AND T H C SO THEY LOOKED AT C B D I NO LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THEIR INTERESTED IN C B D IS ONE OF THE FEW STUDIES I COULD FIND WHERE A THEY EXPLORED DIFFERENT PER CENTAGES OF T H C AND C B D IN THESE UM I CANABUS OR MARUANA CIGARETTES BASICALLY A THE TOTAL AMOUN T THAT THEY CONSUMED I BELIEVE WAS EIGHT HUNDRED MILIGRAMS THESE AGAIN ARE NOT SUGGESTIONS A TIS US US SIMPLY REPORTING WHATS IN THE STUDY YOU CAN GANOL PROVIDE A LINK AM THEY LOOKED AT OSE D SYMPTOMS RATINGS THEY LOOKED AT CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS THEY HAD  LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENTHINGS THAT THEY EXPLORED AND I SHOULD SAY THIS STUDY WAS DONE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND IT WAS THE FIRST PLOCEBO CONTROLLED INVESTIGATION OF CANABISTS AND ADULTS WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER PRETTY INTERESTING AND I'M JUST READING FROM THEIR CONCLUSIONS HERE THE DATOS SUGGEST THAT SMOTE CANABUSTS WHETHER CONTAINING PRIMARILY T H C OR CEB D MEMBER THEY LOOK TA DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF THOSE HAS LITTLE ACUTE IMPACT MEANING IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON OSE D SYMPTOMS AND YIELD SMALLER REDUCTIONS AND ANXIETY COMPLAYERED TO PLICEBO SAT THEY DID NOT SEE A WHEN I SAY A POSITIVE EFFECT I MEAN A A AMILERTIVE REFACT AN EFFECT IN REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF OSED FROM CANABASTS OR OR C B D WHICH OM YUIT'S UNFORTUNATETHING ITS UNFORTUNAT ANYTIME OF TREATMENT DOESN'T WORK BUT NONE THELESS THOSE OFE THE DAT 'M SURE THEY'RE GING T BE OTHER STUDIES I'M SURE THE'R ALSO CON BE PEOPLE IN THE UTO COMMEN SECTION SAYING THAT KANABAS AND SEB D HELPS THERE AM OSE D SYMPTOMS AT LEAST I ANTICIPATE THEIR PROBABLY WILL ALMOST EVERYTHING I SAY HERE SOMEBODY WILL CONTRADICT IT WITH SOMETHING FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE WHICH I ENCOURAGE BY THE WAY I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR EPERIENCE WITH CERTAIN THINGS EVEN OF ITS NOT FROM RANAMIZE PLICIBO CONTROLLED STUDIES I STILL FIND IT VERY INTERESTING TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IN WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCING I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BETTER USES OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMMEN SECTIONS IS TO BE ABLE TO SHARE SOME OF THAT NOT IN AN ADVICE GIVING WAY OR PRESCRIPTIVE WAY BUT SIMPLY IS AWAY TO SHARE IN ENCOURAGE DIFFEREN TYPES OF EXPLORATION THERE ARE OTHER SORTS OF DRUG TREATMENTS THAT ARE GAINING POPULARITY FOR OCE D AT LEAST IN THE RESEARCH REALM ONE TREATMENT THAT IS A LEGAL AL E G AL RIGHT SOME HAS WHEN I SAY LEGAL SOMETIS PEOPLE THINK I SAY ELEGAL BUT THAT IS LEGAL AT LEAST BY PERSCRIPTION IN THE UNITED STATES IS KEDNEMINE THE ACTIONS OF KEDEMINE ARE SOMEWHAT COMPLEX ALTHOUGH WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT KEDEMINE ACTS ON THE GLUDOMATE SYSTEM IT TENDS TO DISRUPT THE TRANSMISSION OR THE RELATIONSHIP I SHOULD SAY BETWEEN GLUDOMATE RIGHT NOT GLUDOMIN NOT THE AMENOASID BUT GLUDOMATE THE NAURO TRANSMITTER AND THE SO CALLED N M D A THE N METHELD ASPORTATE RECEPTOR WHICH IS A RECEPTOR THAT'S VERY SPECIAL IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BECAUSE WHEN GLUDOMATE BONDS TO THE ENEM D A RECEPTOR IT TENDS TO OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT PARTICULAR SENAPS TO GET STRONGER SO CLED NEURO PLASTICITY AND KEDEMINE IS A ESSENTIALLY AN ANTAGONIST ALTHOUGH IT WORKS TO RE COMPLICATED MECHANISM IT TENDS TO BLOCK THAT BINDING OF GLUDOMATE TO THE ENEMDY A RECEPTOR OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT KEDEMINE THERAPE IS NOW BEING USED QUITE EXTENSIVELY FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRAMA AND FOR DEPRESSION AT LEADS TO A DISSOCIATIVE STATE IT'S A SO CALLED DISSOCIOVE ANAL GESIC AND THE VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH THAT HAPPENS WE DIDNA'T EPISODE ON DEPRESSION WERE GING TO DO ANOTHER ENTIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT KEDEMIN DESCRIBING THE NETWORKS THAT KEDEMINE IMPACTS ET CETERA KEEMINE ERAPIES ARE BEING EXPLORED FOR OSED AS OF NOW THE DATA LOOK SOMEWHAT PROMISING BUT THERE'S STILL LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE MY READ OF THE DATA ARE THAT THE MORE EXTENSIVE CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE NOT HAPPENED YET THE SMALLER STUDIES THAT HAVE HAPPENED REVEAL THAT SOME PATIENTS DO GET SOME RELIEF FROM CETEMIN THEROPY FOR OSED BUT THERE WIS NOTHING OVERWHELMINGLY POINTING TO THE FACT THAT CEDEMINE IS A MAGIC BULLET FOR OSED TREATMENT SO CANABUS SBD AT LEAST NOW EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONE SMALLER STUDY THERE'S NO REAL EVIDENCE THAT IT CAN ALLEVIATE OSED SYMPTOMS IF THERE ARE NEW STUDIES PUBLIS SOON I'LL BE SURE TO UPDATE YOU AND IF YOU SEE THOSE STUDIES PLEASE SEND THEM TO ME KEDEMINE THERAPBY THE JURY IS STILL OUT SYLLICIVEAN THE JURY IS STILL OUT THESE AR EARLY DAYS ANOTHER TREATMENT THAT'S BECOMING SOMEWHAT COMMONERLESE PEOPLE ARE COMMONLY EXCITED ABOUT IS TRANS TRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION SO THIS IS THE USE OF A MAGNETIC COIL THIS IS COMPLETELY NON INVASIVE PLACED ON ONE PORTION OF THE SKULL AND ONE CAN DIRECT MAGNETIC ENERGY TOWARD PARTICULAR AREAS THE BRAIN TO EITHER SUPPRESS OR NOWDAYS YOU CAN ALSO ACTIVATE PARTICULAR BRAIN REGIONS THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING DATA SHOWING THAT IF T AMS IS APPLIED TO AREAS OF THE BRAIN INVOLVED IN THE GENERATION OF MOTOR ACTION SO THE SO CALLED MOTOR AREAS ARE SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREAS AS THEY'RE CALLED WHILE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT OR HAVE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS WE KNOW THAT THE T AMES COIL CAN INTERRUPT THE MOTOR BEHAVIORS THE COMPULSIVE BEHAVIORS AND AT LEAST IN A SMALL COHORD OF STUDIES AN A SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITHIN THOSE STUDIES THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE NOT JUST WHILE THE COIL IS ON THE HEAT OF COURSE BUT ACT AFTER THE STUDY HAS BEEN PERFORMED TOF THE TREATMENTS BEEN PERFORMED IN REDUCING OSED SYMPTOMS BY DISRUPTING THE TENDENCY FOR THE COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR TO BE SO AUTOMATIC ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES OF OBSESSIN COMPULSIVE DISORDER IS THAT YOU KNOW ESPESIOLY OF IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE THE PERSON'S BEEN DEALING WITH IT FOR A WHILE THERE ISN'T A PATTERN IN WHICH THE PERSON THINKS AH I HAVE THIS YOU KNOW CONTAMINATION FEAR OR I NEED SYMETRY OR I 'M KIND OF OBSESS TO COUNT TO THE NUMBER SEVEN AND THEN THEY PAUSE AND THEY AND THEN THEY DO IT NO TYPICALLY THERE'S A VERY CLOSE A PARRING OF THE OBSESSION AN THE COMPULSION IN TIME SO THAT SOMEBODY'S WALKING DOWN THE STREET THING IN WONE TO THE ROPIS EXSEVEN ONE O TEAS IS IN ASEVENEETE DO THEN THERE DOING THIS IN SUCH RAPID SUCCESSION BECAUSE THE OBSESSIONS ARE COMING UP SO QUICKLY RIGHT THOUGHTS CAN BE GENERATE VERY QUICKLY AND THEN THEI'RE GENERING THE COMPULSIONS OF THE WAY TO BEAT DOWN OR TO TRY AND SUPPRESS THAT ANXIETY AND THEN IT COMES RIGHT BACK UP AGAIN AT EVEN STRONGER AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER SO TRANSCRANUAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION SEEMS TO INTERVENE IN THESE VARIOUS FAST PROCESSIES RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT T AMAS IS A MAGIC BULLET EITHER I THINK THERE'S LOT OF EXS TEMENT ABOUT TMAS AND IN PARTICULAR REALLY WANT OF NAIL THIS POINT HOME IN PARTICULAR THERE'S EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE COMMINATION OF TAMAS WITH DRUG TREATMENTS OR THE COMMINATION OF TMS WITH COGNIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT NOT JUST FORSAKE OF DISCUSSION ABOUT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER BUT ALSO DEPRESSION A ADIT A SKIS A FRENIA ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PSYCHIA PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES AN DISORDERS IN MOST CASES ARE GOING TO RESPOND BEST TO A COMMINATION OF BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT THAT'S ON GOING THAT OCCURS IN THE LABORATORYAND CLINICAL SETTING BUT ALSO IN THE HOMESETTING WHERE THERE'S HOMEWORK MABE AN HOME VISITS DRUG TREATMENTS OFTEN NOT ALWAYS ARE A TERRIFIC AUGMENT TO THOSE COGNIF BEHAVIORAL THERAPYES OR OTHER BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES AND THEN NOW WE ARE LIVING IN THE AGE OF BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE YOU HAVE COMPANIES NI LIKE NURL LENGTH THAT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY ORE GOING TO ENTER THE BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE WORLD FIRST THROVE THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN CYNDRUMS RITE MOVEMENTS INDRUMS OR PSYCHIATRIC SYNTEMS PROBABLY BEFORE THEY START PUTTNG ELECTRODES INTO THE BRAIN TO STIMULATE ENHANCED MEMORY OR INHANCE COGNITION WHO KNOWS I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHIT THEI'RE DOING BEHIND THE WALLS OF NURL LENG BUT I HAVE TO IMAGINE IN FACT I WOULD WAGER MAY BE NOT BOTH ARMS BUT I'LL WAGE R MY LEFT ARM THAT THE FIRST SET OF FTE APPROVED TECHNOLOGIES TO COME OUT OF COMPANIES LIKE NURAL LENGTH ARE GOING TO BE THOSE FOR THE TEATMENT OF THINGS LIKE PARKINSONS AND MOVEMENT DISORDERS AND COGNIV DISORDERS RATHER THAN SHALL WE SAY CIND OF RECREATIONAL A COGNIVE IN HANCEMEN OR THINGS OF THAT SORT SO TRENSCANIA MAGNETIC STIMULATION IS NON INVASES OF IT DOESN'T INVOLVE GOING DOWN BELOW THE SKULL CAN HAVE SOME EFFECT BUT MOST LABORATORIES THAT I'M AWARE OF IT STAMPFORD AND ELSEWHERE ARE COMTHAT ARE EXPLORING TAMAS FOR THINGS LIKE OC D AND OTHER TYPES OF PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES ARE USING TAMAS IN COMMINATION WITH DRUG THERAPIES ARE USING IN SOME CASES FOR INSTANCE A LABORATORY AT STAMFORD HOPE TO GET UMON THE POGCAST A PSYCHATRIS NOAND WILLIAMS IS EXPLORING TAMAS IND COMMINATION WITH PSYCHODELIC THERAPIES NOT NECERLYC THE SAME TIME BUT NONE THE LESS COMBINING THEM ARE EXPLORING HOW THEY IMPACE BRAIN CIRCITRY SO IF YOU HAVOCED SHOULD YOU RUN OUT AND GET TAMASOR SHOULD YOU TRY KEDAMINE THERAPY OF COURSE WITH THE LICENSE PHYSICION I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY A TO SAY YES I THINK THE THE ANSWER ISI WE NEED TO WAIT AND CEE I THINK COGNA BEHAVIORAL THERAPY THE ESCESSORISE AND SOME OTHER DRUG TREATMENTS LIKE NER ELECTICS COMBINE WITH ESCESSORIZE AND COGNI BEHAVORAL THERAPY ARE WHERE THE REAL BULK OF THE DATA ARE I WANT TO MAKE ONE ADDITIONAL POINT ABOUT CANABUS C B D AS IT RELATES TO OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER TO ME IT'S NOT AT ALL SURPRISING THAT CANABUS C B D DID NOT IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF OC D BECAUSE IN MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR PALCONTI A FEW WEEKS AGO MUCHOU MENTION DOCTOR CONTY IS INDEED A MEDICAL DOCTOR PSYCHATRICS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CANABUS AND ITS VARIOUS USES BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE SOME CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND HE MENTION THAT ONE OF THE MAIN EFFECTS OF CANABUS IS TO TIGHTEN FOCUS AND TO INHANCE CONCENTRATION ON AND THOUGHTS ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR THING AND IN SOME CASES THAT CAN BE CLINICALLY BENEFICIAL AND INOTHER CASES THAT CAN BE CLENCALLY DETRIMENTAL IF YOU ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT CANABUS INCREASES FOCUS AND YOU THINK ABOUT OSED AND THE NETWORKS INVOLVED AND YOU THINK ABOUT THE ANXIETY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OBSESSION AND COMPULSION BET THEN IT SHOULDN'T COME AS ANY SURPRISE THAT CANABAS DID NOT IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF OSED BECAUSE IF ANYTHING IT WOULD INCREASE FOCUS ON THE OBSESSIONS AND THE COMPULSIONS NOW THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY OBSERVE THEY DID NOT SEE AN EXASCURBATION OR A WORSENING OF THE SYMPTOMS OF OSED WITH CANABAS TLEAST THAT'S NOT MY READ OF THE DATA BUT THEY DID NOT SEE AN IMPROVEMENT INOSED SYMPTOMS WITH CANABUS OR SEBED AND TO ME THAT'S NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THE CANABUS SEEBED SEEMS TO INCREASE FOCUS NEXT ID LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RESEARCH ON AND THE RULES OF HORMONES IN OSED BECAUSE TURNS OUT TO BE A VERY INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP THERE BUT BEFORE I DO I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT I REALIZE THAT PROBALY SHOULD HAVE SAID EARLIER WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEY THINGS FOR SOME ONE WITH OSED TO COME TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE ANY RELIEF OF THEIR SYMPTOMS WHETHER NOT THEIR DOING DRUG TREATMENTS OR BEHAVOUR OL TREATMENTS ARE OTHERWISE IS THAT THOUGHTS ARE NOT AS BAD AS ACTIONS RIGHT THOUGHTS ARE NOT AS BAD AS ACTIONS ONE OF THE AND RULES THAT PEOPLE WITH OSED SEEM TO ADOPT FOR THEMSELVES IS THAT THOUGHTS ARE REALLY TRULY THE EQUIVALENT OF ACTIONS SO THEY'GL HAVE AN INTRUSIVE THOUGHT AND EVEN SPENT TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS TO DAY BUT EARLIER I TOUCHED ON THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN OSED ARE REALLY DISTURBING THEY CAN BE REALLY GROSS OR T LEAST GROSS TO THAT PERSON THEY CAN EVOKE IMAGERY THAT IS YOU KNOW TOXIC OR INFECTIOUS ORS HILY SEXTUALIZED IN A WAY THAT IS DISTURBING TO THEM CAN BE VERY TABOO THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON WHEN YOU START TALKING TO PEOPLE WITH OSED AND YOU START PULLING ON THE THREAD AGAIND THIS WOULD BE A PSYCHATRUS WHO TRAINED ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND GAIN THE COMFORT AND TRUST OF A PATIEN THEY STARE TO REVEAL THAT THESE THESE THOUGHTS ARE REALLY INTRUSIVE AND KIND OF DISTURBING WHICH IS WHY THEY FEEL SO COMPELLED TO TRY AND SUPPRESS THEM WITH BEHAVIORS ONE OF THE POWERFUL ELEMENTS OF TREATMENT FOR OSED IS TO REALLY SUPPORT THE PATIENT AND MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT THOUGHTS ARE JUST THOUGHTS AND THAT EVERYONE HAS DISTURBING THOUGHTS AND THAT OFTENTIMES THOSE DISTURBING THOUGHTS ARISE AT THE MOST INCONVENIENT AND SOMETIMES WHAT SEEMS LIKE THE MOST INAPPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THIS RELATES TO A WHOLE LARGER DISCUSSION THAT WE COULD HAVE ABOUT WHAT OUR THOUGHTS AND WHY DO THEY SURFACE AND HOW COME WHEN YOU STAND AT THE EDGE OF A BRIDGE EVEN IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO JUMP OFF YOU THINK ABOUT JUMPING OFF AND I THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AS A PREDICTION MACHINE IS OFTENTIMES T ESTING POSSIBILITIES AND SOMETIMES THAT TESTING GOES WAY OFF INTO THE A NETHER LANDS OF THE THOUGHT PATTERNS AND EMOTIONAL PATTERNS THAT WE ALL HAVE INSIDE OF US THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A THOUGHT AND IN ACTION IS THAT OF COURSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ONE CASE NOT TRANS LATING THOSE PATTERNS OF THINKING IN TO MOTOR SEQUENCES THAT NURDY WAY OF SAYING THOUGHTS AREN'T ACTIONS BELIEVE ITARE NOT CAN BE HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE IF THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT AND USES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE THAT FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE NOT CRAZY THEY'RE NOT THINKING AND FEELING IN THE STUFF BECAUSE THEY'RE BAD OR EVIL AND OF COURSE SOMETIMES THIS CAN CROSS OVER WITH OTHER OTHER ELEMENTS OF LIFE WERE WE PLACE MORAL JUDGMENT ON PEOPLE FOR CERTAIN BEHAVIORS I THING THAT PART OF A HEALTHY SOCIETY OF COURSE ATS WHERE WE HAVE LAWS AND PUNISHMENTS AND AND REWARDS FOR THAT MATTER FOR CERTAIN TIPES OF BEHAVIORS BUT THIS IDEA THAT THOUGHTS ARE NOT AS BAD AS ACTIONS AND THOUGHTS CAN BE TOLERATED AND THE ANXIETY AROUND THOUGHTS CAN BE TOLERATED AND OVER TIME CAN DIMINISH THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL HULMARK THEME OF THE TREATMENT OF OSED SO I BE REMISS IF I DIDN MENTION IT THOUGHTS ARE NOT ACTIONS ACTIONS CAN HARM US THEY CAN HARM OTHER PEOPLE THEY CAN SO UP ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME THOUGHTS CAN SO SOAK UP ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME THEY CAN BE VERY TROUBLING THEY CAN BE VERY DETRIMENTAL WE OF COURSE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT BUT WHEN IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IT THE FIRST STEP IN TREATMENT FOR OS D IS THIS REALIZATION WERE THE APPROACH TO THE REALIZATION THAT THOUGHTS ARE NOT AS BAD AS ACTIONS SO WHAT ABOUT HORMONES IN OSE D WILL THIS HAS BEEN EXPLORED I'LL BE IT NOT AS EXTENSIVELY AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED NIT TO FINE BUT WHEN I WENT INTO THE LITERATURE FOUND A ONE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING STUDY ENTITLED NUROSTEROID LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER FORSOTHER ERBAY AND THIS ALWAYS WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDY THE OBJECT OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE CYRUM WITHIN BLOOD NUROSTEROID LEVELS IN PEOPLE WITH OSE D WHY WELL BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OSED AND ANXIETY AND THE FACT THAT IN STRESS RELLY DISORDER SUCH AS ANXIETY IN DEPRESSION THE HORMONES HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY EXPLORED BUT NOT SO MUCH IN OSE D AT LEAST UNTIL THI STUDYE SO THEY COMPARED CRUM LEVELS OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HORMONES FOR GESTERONE PREGNENT ALONE D A G A A CORTESAL AN TESTOSTRONE THIS WAS DONE IN THIRTY PATIENTS WITH OSED AND THIRTY HEALTHY CONTROLS SO IT'S NOT A HUGE STUDY BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO DRAWSOM SOME PRETTY NICE CONCLUSIONS THESE SUBJECTS WERE EIGHTEEN TO FORTY NINE YEARSOLD AND THE CONTROLS WERE AGENT SEX MATCHED A HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS AGAIN KNOW OSE D WHAT WAS THE BASIC TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY THE BASIS TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY WAS THAT IN FEMALES WITH OS D THERE WAS EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED CORTESAL N D A G A NOW THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE CORTESAL IS WELL KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATE WITH THE STRESS SYSTEM ALTHOUGH EVERY DAY SHOULD MENTION WE ALL MALO R FEMALE EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES AN INCREASE IN CORTISAL SHORTLY AFTER WAKENING THAT' S A HEALTHY INCREAS IN CORTISAL LATE SHIFT AD MEAN LATE LATE IN THE DA PIKS IN CORTISALL OR ASHIFT IN THAT CORTISAL PIK TO LATER IN THE DAY IS A KNOWN CORTILET OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS SO THE FACT THAT CORTISALL IS ELEVATED IN D  C E ARE ELEVATED IN A FEMALE PATIENS WITH TO S D SUGGESTS THAT THE CORTISAL IS EITHER REFLECTIVE OF OR CAUSAL FOR THE INCREASE IN ANXIETY WE DON'T KNOW THE DIRECTION OF THAT EFFECT NOW IN MALE PATIENS ITHTHO S D THERE WAS EVIDENCE FOR INCREASED CORTISAL AGAIN NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THE ROLE OF ANXIETY IN CORTESAL RUSSIES A GIVEN THE ROLE OF CORTISAL IN ANXIETY AND THE INCREASING AXIETY SEEN IN OS D BUT THERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN TESTOSTRONE WHICH SHOULD ALSO NOT SURPRISE US BECAUSE CORTISAL AN TESTOSTRONE MORE LESS COMPETE IN SOME FASHION FOR A THEIR OWN PRODUCTION BOTH ARE DERIVED FROM THE MOLECULE COLESTERAL AND THERE CERTAIN BOUT CHEMICAL PATHWAYS THAT CAN EITHER DIRECT THAT GLESTRAL MOLECULE TOARD CORTISAL SYNTHESIS OR TESTOSTRONE SYNTHESIS BUT NOT BOTH SO THEY COMPETE SO WHEN CORIAL GOESSOP IN GENERAL NOT ALWAYS BUT IN GENERAL TESTOSTRONE GOES DOWN AND VICE VERSA FEU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORTISOL TESTSTRONE AND THEIR EVEN SOME TOOLS TO TRY AND OPTIMIZE THOSE RATIOS IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES YOU FIND THAT IN OUR EPISODEON OPTIMIZING TESTOSTRONE AN ESTERGEN THAT'S A HUBERMAABDOT COM NOW I WOULD SAY THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS STUDY IS NOT THAT D  C E AND CORTISAL ELEVATN FEMALES WITH TO C D R THAT CORTISL TOSTOSTERONE HAVE THIS OPPOSIFAT CORTISAL UP IN TESTOSTRON DOWN IN MALES WITH OS D BUT RATHER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL OF THOSE D  C  CORTISAL AND TESTOSTERONE IN TERMS OF GABA GABA AGAIN BEING THIS INHIBITORY NOR TRANSMITTER THAT TENDS TO QUIET CERTAIN NORONAL PATHWAYS IS DOES DIFFERENT THINGS IT DIFFEREN CYNAPS IS BUT IN GENERAL THE MORE GABA THAT'S PRESENT THE MORE IN ABITION THAT'S PRESENT AND THEREFORE THE MORE SUPPRESSION OF NORAL ACTIVITY AND D A C E IS KNOWN TO BE A POTENT ANTAGONIST OF THE GABA SYSTEM SO HERE WE HAVE ELEVATED D  C E IN FEMALES AND I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT TESTOSTERONE IS ALSO KNOWN TO TAP INTO THE GABA SYSTEM TYPICALLY WHEN TESTOSTRONE IS ELEVATED GABA TRANSMISSION AT LEAST IS SLIGHTLY ELEVATED SO HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION IN WHICH THE PATTERN OF HORMONES IN FEMALES AND MALES WITH OS D ARE H ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN PEOPLE WITHOUT OS D SUCH THAT GABA TRANSMISSION IS ALTERED AND THE NET EFFECT WOULD BE AND OVER ALL REDUCTION IN GABA NOW GABA AS IN INHIBITORYANOR TRANSMITTER AND ROADLY SPEAKING IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND ITTENDS TO CREATE BALANCE WITHIN VARIOUS NERAL CIRCUITS NOW THAT'S A VERY BROAD STATEMENT BUT WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE IN EPILEPCY THAT GABAL LEVELS ARE REDUCED IN THEREFORE YOU GET RUNAWAY EXCITATION OF CERTAIN CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND THEREFORE SEIZURES EITHER PETIT MAL MANY SEIZURES OR GRANDMAL MASSIVE SEIZURES OR EVEN DROPS SEIZURES WERE PEOPLE COMPLETELY COLLAPSED TO THE FLOOR IN SEIZRE YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORH  I CERTAINLY HAVE ITS VERY DRAMATIC AN AN ASHS QUITE ON DEBILITATING FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THESE SEIZURES ARE COMING ON MOST OFTEN AN THEN THEY YOU KNOW THEY CAN FALL INTO A STOVE OR WHILE DRIVING ET CETERA SO THE SITUATION WITH O C D IS ONE IN WHICH FOR WHATEVER REASON WE DON'T KNOW THE DIRECTION OF EFFECT CERTAIN HORMONES ARE ELEVATED IN FEMALES IN CERTAIN HORMONES ARE ELEVATED IN MALES AND THOSE HORMONES DIFFER BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES AND YET THEY BOTH FUNDEL INTO A SYSTEM WHERE GABA URGIC OR GABA TRANSMISTION IN THE BRAIN IS REDUCED BECAUSE OF THIS ABILITY FOR THOSE PARTICULAR HORMONS TO BE ANTAGONISTS TO GABA D AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE'S LIKELY TO BE OVERALL LEVELS OF INCREASED EXCITATION IN CERTAIN ET WORKS IN THE BRAIN AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THIS CORTICO STRIADAL THELAMIC LOUP THIS REPETITIVE LOUP THAT SEEMS TO REENFORCE WE CAN SAY REINFORCES OBSESSION LEADS TO ANXSIETY LEADS TO COMPULSION LEADS TO TRANSIENT RELIEF OF ANXIETY WITHEN INCREASE IN ANXIETY INCREASED OBSESSION ANXIETY COMPULSION ANXIETY COMPULSION ANXIETY COMPULSION AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO I HAVE NOT FOUND STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED ADJUSTING TESTOSTERONE LEVELS THROUGH EXAUGEONIS ADMINISTRATION CREAMER INJECTION ARE OTHERWISE OR THAT HAVE FOCUS ON REDUCING D  C E IN FEMALES IF ANY ONE IS AWARE OF SUCH STUDIES PLEASE PUT THEM IN THE COMMEN SECTION ON UTUBE OR SEND THETOMUS WE HAVE A CONTAC CIDE ON THE WEBSIDE A HUBERMLAVDA COMBA THE COMMENT SECTION ON UTO WOULD BE O BEST BUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT HORMONES IMPACNEROMODULATORS AND NARROW TRANSMITTERS AS I JUST DESCRIBED AND THAT THOSE NERMODULATORS IN NERO TRANSMITTERS PLAY AN INTIMATE ROLE IN THE GENERATION AND THE TREATMENT OF THINGS LIKE OSED IT STANDS TO REASON THAT MANIPULATIONS OF THOSE HORMONE SYSTEMS HOWEVER SUBTLE OR DRAMATIC MIGHT ON HIGHLIGHT MIGHT PROVE USEFUL IN ADJUSTING THE SYMPTOMS OF OSEDI AND I HOPE THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT OU RESEARCERS ARE GOING TO PURSUE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE BECAUSE MANY OF THE TREATMENTS FOR REDUCING D  E OR INCREASING TESTOSTERONE AR REDUCING CORTIZAL HAVE ALREADY MADE IT THROUGH FT E APPROVAL THEIR OUT THERE O THEIR READILY PRESCRIBED MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY IN GENERIC FORM WHICH MEANS THAT THE PATENTS HAVE ALREADY LAPSED ON THE O ON THE FIRST VERSIONS OF THOSE DRUGS SO WHEN THEIR AVAILABLES GENERI DRUGS VERY OFTEN THEIR AVAILABLE AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST A THERE'S HOLE DISCUSSION WE HAVE THEREABOUT PATENT LAWS AND AND O PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT BECAUSE THESE DRUGS ARE LARGELY AVAILE AL IN PRESCRIPTION YET GENERIC FORM I THINK THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE HOW HORMONES NOT JUST CORT IS ALL TESTOSTRONE AND D  G A BUT THE HOR A HUGE CATEGORY OF FORMONES MIGHT IMPACT THE SYMPTOMS OF OS D ESPECIALLY SINCE MANY OF THE SYMPTOMS OF OSD SHOW UP RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF PUBERTY WE HAVENT TALKED A LOT ABOUT CHILDHOOD OSD CAUS WE ARE GOING TO DO AN ENTIRE SERIES ON CHILDHOOD PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND CHALLENGES BUT MANY CHILDREN DEVELOP OSD EARLY AS YOUNG AS IN THREE OR FOUR BELIEVE IT OR NOT OR EVEN SIX OR SEVEN AND TEN AND INADOLESCENS AND CERTAINLY AROUND PUBERT AND IN YOUNG ADULTHOOD IT IS RARE ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAPPEN THAT PEOPLE WILL DEVELOP OSD VERY LATEEN LIFE AROUND FORTY OR OLDER JUST KIND OF SPONTANEOUSLY MOST OFTEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR CLENICAL HISTORY YOU FIND THAT EITHER THEY WERE HIDING IT OR AS BEING SUPPRESSED IN SOME WAY OR IF IT DOES SPONTANEOUSLY SHOW UP LATEN LIFELIKE MID THIRITIES OR IN FORD ONE'S FORTIES TYPICALLY THERE'S A TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY CAN BE DUE TO STROKE OR A PHYSICAL INTURYE OFTHE HEAD OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT NONE THE LESS THERE IS A INTERESTING CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ONSET OF PUBERTY IN CERTAIN FORMS OF OS D A CERTAIN FORMS OF OER I SHOULD SAY THIS SERNASPECTS OF MEN OPAUS THAT CAN RELATE TO OS D YOU CAN FIND ALL THESE THINGS IN THE LITERATURE ALL THIS TO SAY THAT HORMONES IMPACTNERO TRANSMERS IN ERMODULATORS WHICH CLEARLY IMPACT THE KINDS OF CIRCUITS THAT INVOLVED IN OS D AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EXPLORATION OF HOW THESE HORMONES IMPACT OS D IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE NOW THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE EXPLORING HOW TESTOSTERONE THERAPY BOTH IN MALES AND FEMALES CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN SOM CASES IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY RELATED DISORDERS BUT NOT AT LEAST OF MY KNOWLEDGE IN OS D IN PARTICULAR SO THIS WHOLE AREA OF THE USE OF TOSTOSTRONE AND ESTERGEN THERAPS D  G E CORTIS ALL SUPPRESSION OR MAYBE VEN INHANCEMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF OS D IS ESSENTIALLY A BIG BLACK BOX THAT VERY SOON I BELIEVE WILL BE LIT I REALIZE THAT A NUMBER OF LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST ARE PROBABLY INTERESTED IN THE NON TYPICAL OR HOLISTIC TREATMENTS FOR OS D DOCTOR BLAYR SIMPSON'S LAB HAS AT LEAST ONE STUDY EXPLORING THE ROLE OF MINDFULNESS MEDITATION FOR THE THE TREATMENT OF OS D THERE THE DATA ARE LITTLE BIT A COMPLICATED AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING T LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES PROBABLY ELSEWHERE AS WELL BUT GOOD THNGS ARE HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE EXPLORATION OF THINGS LIKE MEDITATION AND OTHER LET'S CALL THEM NON TRADITIONAL OR HOLISTIC FORMS OF OF TREATMENT FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS BECAUSE OF THE DIVISION OF COMPLIMENTARY HEALTH THAT'S NOW BEEN LAUNCHED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH SO WHEREAS BEFORE PEOPLE WOULD THINK ABOUT A MEDITATION OR YOGANY DRA OR EVEN SED D SUPPLEMENTATION FOR THAT MATTER AS CAN A FRINGE MAY BE OR CONOWOO OR A NON TRADITIONAL AT THE VERY LEAST THE NATIONALINSTITUTES OF HEALTH IN UNITED STATES HAS NOW DEVOTED AN ENTIRE DIVISION ENTIRE INSTITUTE PURELY FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THINGS LIKE BREATHING PRACTICS MEDITATION AT CETERA SO THERE'S A CANCER INSTITUTE THERE'S A HERING AND DEFINIS INSTITUTE THERE'S A VISION INSTITUTE AND NOW THERE'S THIS COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH INSTITUTE WHICH I THINK IS A WONDERFUL O ADDITION TO THE MORE TRADITIONAL ON ASPECTS OF MEDICINE I THINK A NO POSSIBLE USEFUL TREATMENT SHOULD BE OVERLOOKED OR UNRESEARCHED IN MY OPINION PROVIDED THAT CAN E DONE SAFELY AND AS I MENTION DOCTOR BLAIR SIMPSON'S LAB IS LOOKED AT THE ROLE OF MINDFULNESS MEDITATION THE TREATMENT OF OSE D NOW WE SHOULD ALL KEEP IN MIND NO PUNINTENDED THAT MOST OF THE DATE ON MINDFULNESS MEDITATION SHOWS THAT IT INCREASES THE ABILITY TO FOCUS NOW THIS BRINGS US BACK TO A KIND OF REPEATING THEME TO DAY WHICH IS THAT INCREASE FOCUS MAY NOT BE THE BEST THING FOR SOMEBODY WITH OSE D BECAUSE IT MIGHT INCREASE FOCUS ON THE OBSESSION AND OR COMPULSION TURNS OUT THAT MINDFULNESS MEDITATION CAN BE USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF OS D BUT MAINLY BY WAY OF HOW IT IMPACTS THE FOCUS ON AND THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN COGNIVE BEHAVIOR ALTHERAPIES SO IT'S VERY UNLIKELY AT LEAST BY MY READ OF THE DATA TO BE A DIRECT EFFECT OF MEDITATION ON RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS RATHER IT SEEMS THAT MEDITATION IS INCREASING FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE COGNIVE BEHAVIOR ALTHERAPY HOME WORK AND TO NOT FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS AND THEREFORE INDIRECTLY IMPROVING THE SYMPTOMS OF OSED NOW SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY AT LEAST TO ME THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN A FAIRLY LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES EXPLORING HOW NEUTRASUTICLES AS THERE SOMETIMES CALLED SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OVER THE COUNTER CAN IMPACT THE TREATMENT OF ASSESS OVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER NOW THERE SUCH AN EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS AND SUPPLEMENTS THAT FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF NEUTRA SUITACLES AND THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLORED IN THE TREATMENT OF OSED THAT I LIKE TO POINT YOU TO A REVI THAT IS ENTITLED NEUTRA SUITICLES IN THE TREATMENT OF OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER A A REVIEW SCUSE ME OF MECHANISTIC AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE THIS WAS PUBLISHING TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SO ATS OVER TEN YEARS OLD AND SO BY NOW HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SUBSTANCES THAT COULD BE EXPLORER BUT THERE JUST ONE OR TWO HERE THAT I WANT A FOCUS ON HERE IN THIS REVIEW THEY DESCRIBE EFFECTS OF FIVE H T P AND TRIP DEFANSE OF THINGS ARE IN THE SERATONAN PATHWAY WHICH WOULD MAKE SENSE GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ASSESS ORISE THAT PEOPLE WOULD EXPLORE HOW DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENTS THAT INCREASE SERTON URGIC TRANSMISSION MIGHT IMPACT OSED WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THEY DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT AFFACTS AN IMPROVING OR REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS OF OSE D IN SOMEWHAT SIMILAR WAY TO SOME OF THE ACESSORISE BUT YOU OF COURSE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ANYTHING THAT'S CAN ATTAPIN TO THE GIVEN NOR CHEMICAL SYSTEM TO THE SAME DEGREE MAY VERY LIKELY HAVE THE SAME SORTS OF SIDE EFFECTS THAT A PRESCRIPTION DRUG WOOLD ONE COMPOUND THAT I LIKE TO FOCUS ON ILITLE MORE DEPTH HOWEVER BECAUSE IT'S EXCITING AND INTERESTING TO ME IS INOCITAL INNOITALLS A COMPOUND THAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN SEVERAL FUTURE PODCAS BECAUSE WELL FIRST OF ALL IT SEEMS THAT CAN HAVE  IMPRESSIVE EFFECTS ON REDUCING ANXIETY IT ALSO CAN HAVE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE FECTS IN IMPROVING FERTILITY IN PARTICULAR IN WOMEN WITH POLYSISTICOVARIANCE INTRUM AND HERE I'M REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO MYO IN NOCITALL BECAUSE IT COMES IN SEVERAL FORMS AND IT DOES APPERE THAT NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ANOCITAL CAN IMPROVE SLEEP AND CAN REDUCE ANXIETY PERHAPS WHEN TAKEN AT THAT DOS AT YOUR HIRE DOSAGES I WILL JUST CONFESS FIRST WHILE I DON'T HAVE OSEED ALTHOUGH I WILL ALSO CONFESS THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD I HAD A TRANSIENT TICK I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS OWN PODCAST BEFORE IT WAS A GRUNTING TICK SO WHEN I WAS ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN I RECALL A TRIP TO WASHINGTON YOU SEE WITH MY FAMILY WHERE I WAS FEELING A STRONG DESIRE OR NEED EVEN AS I RECALL TO GRUNT IN ORDER TO CLEAR SOMETHING IN MY THROAT WHAT I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN MY THROAT IT WAS I DIDNT HAVE A COLD OR ANY POST NASAL TRIP IT WAS REALLY JUST THE FEELING THAT I NEED TO DO THAT TO RELEASE SOME SORT OF TENSION AND I REMEMBER MY DAD AT THE TIME TELL ME DON'T DO THAT YOU KNOW DON'T DO THATS NOT NOT GOOD TO GRUNT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK HE SAW THAT IT WAS IT WAS CONIC COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AND SO IWULD ACTUALY HIDE IN THE BACKSED OF THE RENTAL CAR AND DO IT OR AT HIDE IN MY ROOM FORTUNATELY FOR ME IT WAS TRANSIENT I THINK ABOUT SIX MONTS OR A YEAR LATER DISAPPEARED ALTHOUGH I DIDNT NOTICE ISHL AN EXCROFHRON MIN POINT OUT THAT WHEN I GET VERY TIRED AND I'VE BEN WORKING VERY LONG HOURS SOMETIMES THAT GRUNTING TICK WILL REAPPEAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DO I HAVE TERETS I DON'T KNOW MAYBE I WAS NEVER DIAGNOSE WHICH TRATS TO I HAV OSE D MAYBE A I CERTAINLY COULD BE ACCUSED OF HAVING OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER WHICH WILL AN TALK ABOUT STILL IN A FEW MINUTES BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT MANY CHILDREN TRANSIENTLY EXPRESS TICKS OR LOW LEVEL TERATS OR OSE D AND AGAIN TRANSIENTLY IN IT DISAPPEARS OVER TIME SO INOCITAL HAS BEEN EXPLORED IN BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CONTACTS INCLUDING FOR TICKS IN NOSE D ET CETERA A GOING BACK TO IT TO ANOCITAL AND ITS CURRENT USE OR I SHOULD A MY CURRENT USE I'VE BEEN TAKING NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF A NOCITAL AS AN ADDITION TO MY EXISTING TOOL KIT FOR SLEEP WHICH A TALKED ABOUT MANY TIMES ON THIS PODCAST AND OTHER PODCAS CONSISTS OF MAGNESIUM THREE IN A APIGENAN AND FENINE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT KIT YOU CAN GO TO OUR NEWS LETTER NOR OL NETWORK NEWSLETTER HUVERMA LABDOT COM THE TOOL KIP FOR SLEEP IS THERE YOU DON'T YVEN HAVE TO SIGN UT FOR THE NEWS LETTER BUT 'LL GIVE YOU FLAVOR THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE IN THE NEWS LETTER IN ANY CASE IVE BEEN A EXPERIMENTING A BIT A WITH TAKING NINE HUNDRED MELIGRAMS OF MYO ANOCITAL EITHER ALONE OR COMBINATION WITH THAT SLEEP KIT AND I MUST SAY THE SLEEP I'VE BEEN GETTING ON A NOCITAL IS EXTREMELY DEEP A AND DOES SEEM TO LEAD TO IN HANCE LEVELS OF FOCUS AND ALERTNESS DURING THE DAY AN PERHAPS YOUR NOISING THAT OM TOLKING WMORE QUICKLY ON THIS PODCASTS THAN IN PREVIOUS PODCAST NOW I'M JUST KITTING I DON'T THINK THE TWO THINGS RELATED IN CONICOSAL WAY THE POINT HERE IS THAT IN NOCITAL IS KNOWN TO BE PRETTY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING ANXIETY BUT WHEN TAKEN AT VERY HYHDOSAGES CAN IT DO THE SAME AT LODOSAGES WE DON'T KNOW I WOULD CONSIDER NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS A LODOSE MOST OF THI GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE STUDIES OF INOCITAL HAVE EXPLORED VERY HYDOSAGES LIKE EVEN TAN OR TWELVE GRAHMS PER DAY WHICH I MUST SAY SEEMS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND THEY DO REPORT THAT SOME OF THE SUBJECTS IN THOSE EXPERIMENTS ACTUALLY STOP TAKING THE INOCITAL BECAUSE OF GASTRIC DISCOMFORT OR GASTRIC DISTRESS AS IT'S CALLD SO I'VE REPORTED MY RESULTS WITH SLEEP IN AN KIND OF ANECDOTAL WAY O THEY CERTAINLY AREN'T PUREVUED STUDIES THAT I DESCRIBED ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN AN ECDOTAL WAY BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S BEEN EXPLORED THAT UM YOUO THINGS LIKE GLEICINE WHICH IS ANOTHER A WHICH IS A MENO ACID WHICH ALSO ACES AN HIBITORY NOR TRANSMITTER IN THE BRAIN TAKEN IT VERY HYHDOSAJEST SIXTY GRAHMS PER DAY THAT IS A ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHINGLY HIGH AMOUNT OF GLEICENG I WOULD NOT RECOMMENTAKING THAT MUCH GLEICEN UNLESS YOUR PART OF A STUDY WHERE THEY TELL YOU TO WHEN YOU KNOW IT SAFE O EIGHTEEN MILIBACTIN GRAHMSCUSE ME OF INOCITAL TESE ARE VERY VERY HYHDOSAGES USED IN THESE STUDIES NONE THE LESS THERE SOME INTERESTING DATA ABOUT INOCITOL LEADING TO OM SOME ALE LEVIATION OF OSED SYMPTOMS OR PARTIAL ALLEVIATION OF OSEDY SYMPTOMS IN AS LITTLE AS TWO WEEKS AFTER INITIATING OM THE SUPPLEMENT PROTOCAL SO I THINK THERE'S A GREAT FUTURE FOR THESE NUTRESUITICLES MEANING I THINK MORE SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION IN PARTICULAR LOWER DOSAGES IN THE CONTECTS OF OF OSED TREATMENT AND AS WE SAW BEFOR FOR THE ESCESSORISE AND OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUG TREATMENTS I THINK THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE AN EXPLORATION OF THESE NUTRASUITICLES INCOMMINATION WITH BEHAVIOURAL THERAPIES AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE WITH BRAIN MACHINE IN HER FACE LIKE TRINGCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION AS WELL NOW WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE I ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT OSEDY IS ONE THING OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND IT'S TRULY A DISORDER AND ITS TRULY DEBILITATING AND ITS EXTREMELY COMMON AND THEN THEREIS THIS OTHER THING CALLED OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER WHICH IS DISTINCT FROM THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE INTRUSIVE COMPONENT SO PEOPLE DON'T FEEL OVERWHELMED OR OVERTAKEN BY THESE THOUGHTS RATHER THEY FIND THAT THE OBSESSIONS CAN SOMETIMES SERVE THEM OR THEY EVEN WELCOME THEM I THINK MANY OF US NO PEOPLE LIKE THIS I PERHAPS EVEN COULD BE CUSED OR WHO KNOWS MAY WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING AN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY AT TIMES WHY DO I DRAW THIS DISTINCTION WILL FIRST OF ALL WE'VE COME TO A POINT IN HUMAN HISTORY I THINK IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA BUT ALSO IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THERE ARE NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS BEING HELD ABOUT MENTAL HEL THAT HAVE BROUGHT TERMS LIKE TROMA DEPRESSION OSEEDY ET CETERA INTO THE COMMON VERNACULAR SO THAT PEOPLE WILL SAY AH YOUR SOI OSED OR SOME ONE WILL SAY I WAS TROMATIZED BY THAT OR ASTRMA IZED BY THIS WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL I I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE WORD POLICE BUT WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL IN THE USE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LANGUAGE ESPECIALLY LANGUAGE THAT HAS REAL PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFINITIONS BECAUSE IT CAN REALLY DRAW US OFF COURSE IN PROVIDING RELIEF FOR SOME OF THESE SENDRUMS FOR INSTANCE THE WORD TRAMA S THROWN AROUND LEFT AN RIGHT NOWADAYS I WAS TROMATIZED BY THIS SFOR THAT CAUSE TROMER YOU'RE GIVING ME TRAMA LISTEN I REALIZE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE TROMATIZED BY CERTAIN EVENTS INCLUDING THINGS THAT ARE SAID TO THEM I ABSOLUTELY KNOWLEDGE THAT HENCE ARE EPISODES ON TRAMA AND TROMA TREATMENT SEVERAL OF THEM IN FACT DOCTOR CONTY DOCTOR A DAVID SPEGOL AND THEN DEDICATED SOLO EPISODES WITH JUST ME BLABING ABOUT TRAMAAN TROMA TREATMENT BUT AS DOCTOR CONTY SO APPROPRIATELY POINTED OUT TRAMA IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT CHANGES OUR NERAL CIRCUITRY AND THEREFORE OUR THOUGHTS IN OUR BEHAVIORS IN A VERY PERSISTENT WAY THAT IS DETROMENTAL TO US NOT EVERY BAD EVENT IS TROMATIZING NOT EVERYTHING THAT WE DISLIKE OR EVEN THAT WE HATE OR THAT FEELS TERRIBLE TO US IS TROMATIZING FOR SOMETHING TO REACH THE LEVEL OF TRAMA IT REALLY NEEDS TO CHANGE OUR NORL CIRCUITRY AND THEREFORE OUR THOUGHTS IN OUR BEHAVIORS IN A PERSISTENT WAY THAT IS MALADAPTIVE FOR US SIMILARLY JUST CALLING SOME ONE OBSESSIVE IS ONE THING SAYING THAT SOMEONE HAS OC D OR ASSUMING ONE HAS OC D SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PERSONALITY OR A FINATYPE AS WE SAY WHERE THEY NEED THINGS IN PERFECT ORDER LIKE I FIND MYSELF CORRECTING THESE PENS MAKING SURE THAT THE CAPS AR FAINT PFACING IN THE SAME DIRECTION FOR INSTANCE RIGHT NOW THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS OC D IF FOR INSTANCE I CAN TOLERATE THESE PENS BEING AT DIFFERENT ORIENTATION OR EVEN THROW THE CAP ON THE FLOOR SOMETHEY IT DOESN'T CREATE A LOT OF ANXIETY FOR ME ICONFESS IT AGREATES A LITTLE BUT IN THE MOMENT THEN I CAN FORGET ABOUT AND MOVE ON THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER AND OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER IN ITS STRICTEST FORM NOW ONCE ONE HEARS THAT O C D IS DIFFERENT AND OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER BECAUSE OF THIS DIFFERENCE IN HOW INTRUSIVE THE THOUGHTS ARE OR NOT THEN THAT'S USEFUL BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING MECHANISTICALY IN ONE SITUATION OR ANOTHER FORTUNATELY THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL DATA AGAIN FROM DOCTOR BLAIR SIMPSON'S LAVIN YOU CAN TELL BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT AV REFERRE TOE FROM HER LABORATORY THERS TRULY ONE OF THE LUMINARIES IN THIS FIELD THAT THERE REALLY ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL WIRING DIFFERENCES AND BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE OBSESSIVE COPULSIVE DISORDER AND THOSE WHO HAVE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER SIS THE STUDY FIRST AUTHOR PINTO P N T O ENTITLED CAPACITY TO DELAY REWARE DIFFERENTIATES OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND OF SUBSIE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY ISORDER AND THE METHODS IN THIS STUDY WERE TO TAKE TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE WITH O C D AND TWENTY FIVE PEO WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITYOS SORDER AND TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOTH BECAUSE IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE BOTH AND THAT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT AN TWENTY FIVE SO CALLED HEALTHY CONTROLS PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY ISORDER OR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER THEY TAKE CLINTICAL ASSESSMENTS AND THEN THEY TOOK A NUMBER OF TESTS THAT PROBED THEIR ABILITY TO DEFER GRATIFICATION SOMETHING CALLED IN THE LABORATORY WE ALL THE DELAYD DISCOUNTING SO THEIR ABILITY TO DEFER GRATIFICATION THROUGH A TASK WHERE THEY CAN EITHER ACCEPT REWARD RIGHT AWAY OR ACCEPT REWARD LATER SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE EARD OF THE TWO MARSHMELLOW TASK THIS IS A BASED ON A STUDY WAS PERFORMED YEARS AGO ON YOUNG CHILDREN AT STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE WHERE THEY TAKE YOUNG CHILDREN INTO A ROOM THEY OFFER THEM A MARSHMELLOW KIDS LIKE MARSHMELLOWS GENERALLY AND YOU SAY YOU CAN EAT THE MARSHMELLOW RIGHT NOW OR YOU CAN WAIT SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO WAIT AND NOT EAT THE MARSHMELLOW YOU CAN HAVE TWO MARSHMELLOWS AND IN GENERAL CHILDREN WANT TO MARSHMELLOWS MORE THAN THEY WANT ONE MARSHMELLOW SO REALLY WHAT YOUR PROBING IS THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS DELAYD GRATIFICATION AND THEIR VERY ENTERTAINING A EVEN TRULY A AMUSING A VIDIOS OF THIS ON THE INTERNETE SO IF YOU JUST DO TWO MARSHMELLOW TASK VIDIO AN YOU GOING TO YOU TO WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT THE CHILDREN WILL USE ALL SORTS OF STRATEGIES TO DELAY GRATIFICATION SOME OF THE KIDS WILL COVER THE MARSHMELLOW OTHERS WILL TALK TO THE MARSHMELLAND SAY I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THAT DELICIOUS YOU LOOK DELICIOUS BUT KNOW YOU'RE NOT DELICIOUS THEY'LL ENGAGE WITH THE MARSHAL IN ALL SORTS OF CUTE WAYS THE'LL TURN AROUND AND TRYING TOT YOUNAVOIDANCE WHICH ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO A WHOLE CATEGORY OF BEHAVIORS THAT PEOPLEWITH OSIDI ALSO USE AR NOT SAYING THESE KIDS AT OSIDI BUT AVOIDANCE BEHAVIORS ARE VERY MUCH A COMPONENT DO OSITY PEOPLE REALLY TRYING TO AVOID THE THING THAT EVOKES THE A THE OBSESSION WELL SOME KIDS ARE ABLE TO DELAY GRATIFICATION SOME AREN'T AND IT'S DEBATABLE AS TO WHETHEROR NOT THE KIDS THAT ARE ABLE TO DELAY GRATIFICATION GO ON TO HAVE MORE SUCCESSFUL LIVES ARE NOT INITIALLY THAT WAS THE CONCLUSION OF THOSE STUDIES THER STILL LOT DEBATE ABOUT IT WILL BRING AN EXPERT ON TO GIVE US THE FINAL CONCLUSION ON THIS CAUSE THERE IS ONE AND ITS VERY INTERESTING AND NOT INTUITIVE NONE THE LESS ADULTS ARE ALSO FACED WITH DECISIONS EVERY DAY ALL DAY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN DELAY GRATIFICATION AND THIS STUDY USED A NOT A TWO MARSHMELLOW TASK BUT A GAME THAT INVOLVED REWARDS WHERE PEOPLE COULD DELAY IN ORDER TO GET GREATER WARDS LATER WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION WHILL FIRST OF ALL OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE AND OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER SUBJECTS BOTH SHOWED IMPERAMENTS IN THEIR PSYCLOSO SHAL FUNCTIONING AND QUALITY OF LIFE THEY HAD COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING IN THEIR LIFE BECAUSE THEIR COMPULSIONS ARE REALLY STRONG SO IT'S NOT JUST BEING REALLY NIT PICKY ORE REALLY ORDERLY IN ONE CASE AND AVING FULL BLOWN OSIDI AND THE OTHER BOTH SETS OF SUBJECTS ARE CHALLENGED IN LIFE BECAUSE THEIRE HAVING RELATIONSHIP ISSUES OR JOB RELATED ISSUES AT CETERA BECAUSE THEY ARE THAT COMPULSIVE HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUALS WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER THEY DISCOUNTED THE VALUE OF DELAYED GRATIFICATION SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THOSE WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER WHAT DO I MEAN THEY ARE BOTH IMPAIRING DISORDERS THAT ARE MARKED BY COMPULSIVE BEHAVIORS HERE IM ON PERIPHRASING BUT THEY CAN BE DIFFERENTIATED BY THE PRESENCE OF OBSESSIONS IN OSIDI SO OBSESSIONS IN OSITY PEOPLE WITH OSED ARE ABSOLUTELY FIXATED ON CERTAIN IDEAS AND THOSE IDEAS ARE INTRUSIVE CAN THAT'S THE HULL MARK THEME AND BY AN EXCESSIVE CAPACITY TO DELAY REWARD IN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER THAT IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER ARE REALLY GOOD AT DELAYING GRATIFICATION SO THEY ARE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE VERY INTENSELY AND PERFORM VERY INTENSELY IN WAYS THAT ALLOW THEM TO INSTILL ORDER SUCH THAT THEY CAN DELAY REWARDS NOW YOU CONSEE WHY THIS CONTOUR OF SYMPTOMS MEANING THAT THE PEOPLE WITH OSEDY ARE EXPERIENCE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS WHEREAS THE PEOPLE WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER SHOW AN ENHANCEDABILITY TO DEFER GRATIFICATION YOU COULD SEE HOW THAT WOULD LEAD TO VERY DIFFERENT OUTCOMES PEOPLE WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER CAN ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THAT PERSONALITY DISORDER TO PERFORM BETTER IN CERTAIN DOMAINS OF LIFE NOT ALL DOMAINS OF LIFE BECAUSE REMEMBER AGAIN THESE PEOPLE ARE IN THIS STUDY AND THEIR SHOWING UP AS EXPERIENCING CHALENGES AND LIFE BECAUSE OF THEIR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY ISORDER NONE THE LESS PEOPL WITH OBESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER YOU COAN IMAGINE WOULD BE VERY GOOD AT SAY ARCHITECTURE OR ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES IN STILLING A TON OF ORDER MAY BE SUSICHEF FOR INSTANCE MAY BE A SCHEF IN GENERAL I KNOW SHEFTSLY TO CIND OF THROW THINGS AROUND LIKE THE UM LIKE THE CHEF ON THE MUMPETS ANGISINGLING THROW THINGS EVERYWHERE IN STILL PRODUCE AMAZING FOOD AND THEN THERE SOME PEOPOR THERE INCREDIBLY EXACTING THERE JUST INCREDIBLY PRECISE A THINK THAT MOVIN WHAT IS AT HERO DREAMS OF SUSI THAT MOVIES INCREDIBLE CERTAINLY NOT SAYING HE HAS IVOBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER BUT THINK ITS FAIR TO SAY THAT HE IS OBSESSIVE OR EXTREMELY METICULOUS AND ORDERLY ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM START TO FINISH YOU CAN IMAGINE A HUGE ARRAY OF DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS AND LIFE ENDEAVORS WHERE THIS WOULD BE BENIFICIAL SCIENCE BEING ONE OF THEM WHERE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT TAT ONE BE PRECISE OR MATHEMATICS OR PHYSICS OR ENGINEERING ANYTHING WERE PRECISION HAS A PAY OFF AND GAINING PRECISION TAKES TIME AND DELAY OF IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER WOULD SENERGIZE WELL WITH THOSE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES AND PROFESSIONS WHEREAS OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER IS REALLY INTRUSIVE ITS PREVENTING FUNCTIONALITY IN MANY DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF LIFE SO THE KEE TAKE AWAY HERE IS THAT WHEN WE USE THE WORDS OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE OR WE CALL SOME ONE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE OR WE ARE TRYING TO AVALUE WHETHER R NOT WE ARE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HIGH LIGHT THAT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER IS VERY INTRUSIVE IT INVOLVES INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND IT INTERRUPTS WITH NORMAL FUNCTIONING IN LIFE WHEREAS OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER WHILE IT CAN INTERRUPT NORMAL FUNCTIONING IN LIFE IT ALSO CAN BE PRODUCTIVE IT CAN ENHANCE FUNCTIONING IN LIFE NOT JUST IN WORK BUT PERHAPS AT HOME AS WELL IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY IN  A FAMILY MEMBERS THAT REALLY PLACE ENORMOUS VALUE ON HAVING A BEAUTIFUL AND HIGHLY ORGANIZE HOME WILL THEN IT COULD LEND ITSELF WELL TO THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A MATTER OF DEGREES OF COURSE NONE OF THESE THINGS IS AN ABSOLUTE ITS GOING TO BE ON A CONTINUUM BUT I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER WHETHER NOT IN MILD MODERATE OR SEVERE FORM IS IMPAIRING NORMAL FUNCTIONING WEREAS OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER THERE IS A RANGE OF EXPRESSIONS OF THAT SOME OF WHICH CAN BE ADAPTIVE SOME OF WHICH CAN BE MALADAPTIVE AND AGAIN ITS ALL GOING TO DEPEND ON CONTEXT BEFORE WE CONCLUDE I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S SUPERSTITIONS SUPERSTITIONS ARE FASCINATING AND THER SOME FASCINATING RESEARCH ON SUPERSTITIONS ONE PARTICULAR STUDY THAT I'M A BIG FAN OF IS THE WORK OF BENSO LEVSKY AT HARVARD HE STUDIES MOTOR SEQUENCES AND MOTOR LEARNING AND HE IS BEAUTIFUL DATA ON HOW PEOPLE LEARN FOR INSTANE A TENIS SWING AND THE PATTERNS THAT THEY ENGAGE IN EARLY ON AND THEN THE PATTERNS OF SWINGING THAT THEY SWINGING THE RACKET THAT IS THAT THEY ENGAGE IN LATER AS THEY ACQUIRE MORE SKILL AND BASILY TO TAKE AWAY IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF ERROR OR VARIATION FROM SWING TO SWING IS DRAMATICALLY REDUCED AS THEY ACQUIRE SKILL THAT'S ALL FINE AND GOOD AND THERE SOME BEAUTIFUL A MECHANISTIC DATA THAT HE AND OTHERS HAVE DISCOVERED OM TO SUPPORT HOW THAT COMES TO BE BUT THEY ALSO EXPLORE ANIMAL MODELS IN PARTICULAR RATS PRESSING SEQUENCES OF BUTTONS AND LEVERS TO OBTAIN A REWARD BELIEVEIT ARE NOT RATS ARE PRETTY SMART I'VE SEEN THIS WITH MY OWN EYES YOU CAN TEACH A RAT O PRESS A LEVER FOR A PELLITIVE FOOD RATS CAN ALSO LEARN TO PRESS LEVERS IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE IN ORDER TO GAIN A PIECE OF FOOD AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY LEARN TO PRESS AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF LEVERS AN VERY PARTICULAR SEQUENCES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN PELLEITS OF FOOD YOU CAN ALSO GIVE THEM LITTLE BUTTONS TO PRESS OR ON EVEN A PATTLE TO OR I SHOULD SAY A PEDLE SCUSE ME TO STOMP ON WITH THEIR FOOT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A PETAL O FOOD BASICALLY RATS CAN LEARN EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A PIECE OF FOOD SPECIAL IF THERE MADE A LILBI HUNGRY FIRST THENCAS LAB HAS PUBLISH BEAUTIFUL DAT A SHOWING THAT AS ANIMALS AND HUMANS COME TO LEARN OF PARTICULAR MOTOR SEQUENCE VERY OFTEN THEY WILL INTRODUCE MOTOR PATTERNS IN THAT SEQUENCE THAT ARE IRRELEVA NT TO THE OUTCOME AND YET THAT PERSIST IF YOU'VE EVER WATCH THE GAME OF BASEBALL YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE OFTENTIMES THE PITCHER UPON THE MOUND WILL BRING THE BALV TO THEIR CHIN THEY'LL LOOK OVER THEIR SHOULDER THE LOOK BACK OVER THE OTHER SHOULDER AND THEN THEY WILL OF COURSE REAL BACK AND PITCH THE BALL BUT IF YOU WATCH CLOSELY OFTENTIMES THEI'RE COMPONENTS IN THE MOTOR SEQUENCE WHICH ARE COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THE PITCH THEY'RE NOT LOOKING NECESSARILY TO SEE OF SOME ONE STEALIN A BASE THEY'RE NOT N CESSARILY LOOKING DOWN AT HOME PLATE WHERE THE BATTER IS THEY'RE ALSO DOING THINGS LIKE TOUCHING THE BACK OF TEIR EAR BEFORE THEY BRING THE BALL OF THEIR CHIN ORE ADJUSTING THEIR HAT AND IF YOU WATCH INDIVIDUAL PITCHERS WHT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT THEY'LL DO THE SAME SEQUENTS OF COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT MOTOR PATTERNS BEFORE EACH AND EVERY SINGLE PITCH SIMILARLY RATS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO FOR INSTANCE HIT TO LIEVERS AND STEP ON A PEDAL WITH THEIR LEFT HIND FOOT AND THEN TAP A BUTTON UP ABOVE THAT IS THE RED BUTTON WILL DO THAT TO GAIN A PIECE OF FOOD BUT SOMETIMES THEY'LL ALSO INTRODUCE A PATTERN INTO THAT MOTOR SEQUIENCE WHERE THEY WILL SHAKE THEIR TAIL LITTLE BITTOR THEY'LL TURN THEIR HEAD ALOLE BITT OR THEYLL MOVE THEIR EARS A LITTLE BIT ET CETERA MOTOR PATTERNS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OBTAINING THE PARTICULAR OUTCOME IN MIND IN OTHER WORDS YOU COULD ELIMINATE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MOTOR SEQUINCE AND IT WOULD KNOT MATTER THE RAT WOULD STILL GET THE PELLET THE PITCHER WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO PITCH AND YET THAT AN INTRODUCED BECAUSE SOMEHOW BECAUSE THEY WERE PERFORMED AGAIN AND AGAIN PRIOR TO SUCCESSFUL TRIALS THE RAT OR THE HUMAN BASEBALL PITCHER COMES TO BELIEVE IN SOME WAY THAT IT WAS INVALVED IN GENERATING THE OUTCOME HENCE SUPERSTITION I I CONFESS I HAVE A FEW SUPERSTITIONS I OCCASIONALLY WILL KNOCK ON WOOD I'LL SAY SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO HAPPEN AND I'LL SEY O KNOCK ON WOOD AND I'LL JUST DO IT AND OCCASIONALLY I'LL CHALLENGE MYSELF IN THE EYE TOT WANT A KNOT DON'T KNOCK ON WOOD AND ER DON'T DO THAT THE ON'T KNO ON I D I DON'T THINK ANY ONE WANTS TO BE SUPERSTITIOUS I CERTAINLY DON'T AND SO VERY ON TO WHI I'LL JUST CHALLENGE IT AND I I WON'T ACTUALLY KNOCK ON WOOD I'ADMITTING THIS TO YOU TO KIND OF UM IT'S NORMALIZE SOME OF THIS SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUPERSTITIONS THAT BORDER ON OR EVEN BECOME COMPULSIONS THEY REALLY COME TO BELIEVE THAT IF THEY DON'T KNOCK ON WOOD THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE AS CAN HAPPEN MAY BE SOMETHING IN PERTICULAR OR IN THE CASE OF THE BASEBALL PITCHUR THEY COME TO BELIEVE THAT IF THEY DON'T TOUCH THEIR RIGHT EAR BEFORE THEY REAL BACK ON THE PITCH THAT THE PITCH WON'T BE ANY GOOD HERE THAT THEY'REGON TO LOSE THE GAME  I DO'T KNOWHAT THEIR THOUGHT PROCESSES NOW I ALSO DON'T KNO WHAT THE RAT IS THINKING BUT THE RAT IS CLEARLY DOING SOMETHING OR THINKING SOMETHING IS RELATED TO THE FINAL OUTCOME I DON'T KNOW OF ANY STUDIES WHERE THEY'VE INTERVENED WITH THE PARTICULAR SUPERSTITION LIKE BEHAVIORS OF THE RAT TO SEE WHETHE OR NOT THE RAT SOMEHOW DOESN'T CONTINUE TO DO THE MOTOR SEQUENCE TO GET THE PELLET WE DON'T KNOW THE RATS I DON'T SPEAK RAT MOST PBEOPLE DON'T OR REFOU SPEAK TO RAT IF IT SPEAKS BACK ITS NOT IN ENGLISH IT MAY THE POINT IS THAT SUPERSTITIONS ARE BELIEFS THAT WE ON AN INDIVIDUAL SCALE COME TO BELIEVE ARE LINKED TO THE PROBABILITY OF AN OUTCOME WHEN IN FACT WE KNOW WE ACTUALLY KNOW IN OUR RATIONAL MINDS THEY HAVE NO REAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE OUTCOME SUPERSTITIONS CAN BECOME FULL BLOWN COMPULSIONS AND OBSESSIONS WHEND WE REPEAT THEM OFTEN ENOUGH THAT THEY BECOME AUTOMATIC ND I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE OBSERVE MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WE SEE A PICTURE TOUCHING THEIR EAR OR FOR INSTANCE IN TENNESS YOU SEE THIS ALOT YOU'LL SEE SOMEONE ON THEY'LL THEY'LL SLAP THEIR SHOES OFTEN I SEE THIS LY SLAP THE THEIR UNDERSIDES OF THEIR SOULS THEY MAY TELL THEMSELVES THAT THIS IS I KNOW MAY BE MOVING OUT SOME OF THE DUST OR SOMETHING IN THE BOTTOMS OF THEIR SOULS THAT GIVES THEM MORE TRACTION AN THEY WANT THAT TO BE READY FOR THE SERVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND MAY BE THERE SOME TRUTH TO THAT BUT HEAR WHAT WERE REFERRING TO ARE BEHAVIORS THAT REALLY HAVE NO RATIONAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE OUTCOME AND YET WE PERFORM IN A COMPULSIVE WAY PEOPLE WITH OSED YES TEND TO HAVE MORE SUPERSTITIONS PEOPLE WITH MORE SUPERSTITIONS YES TEND TO HAVE A TENDENCY TOWARDS OSET AND I SHU MENSION OBSESSIV COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER IF YOU THINK WAY BACK TO THE FIRST PART OF THIS EPISODE WHEN I WAS JUST DESCRIBING WHAT THE BRAIN DOES RIGHT WHAT IS YOU RAIN TO HOUSEKEEPING FUNCTIONS TO KEEP YOU ALIVE AND ITS A PREDICTION MACHINE YOUR NORL CIRCUITS YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BIOLOGICAL INVESTMENT OF REAL ESTATE LITERALLY SELLS AND CHEMICALS THAT ARE THERE TO TRYING MAKE YOUR WORLD PREDICTABLE AND TO TRY AND GIVE YOU CONTROL OR AT LEAST THE SENSE OF CONTROL OVER THAT WORLD AND THAT'S A NORMAL PROCESS LOW LEVEL SUPERSTITIONS MODERATE SUPERSTITIONS REPRESENT A KIND OF A HEALTHY RANGE I WOULD SAY OF BEHAVIORS THAT ARE AIMED AT GENERATING PREDICTABILITY THAT DON'T DESTRUPT NORMAL FUNCTION OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER PROVIDED NOT TO SEVERE WOULD I THINK REPRESENT THE NEXT LEVEL ALONG THAT CONTINUUM AND THEN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER IS REALLY A CASE OF HIGHLY DEBILITATING HIGHLY INTRUSIVE REALLY OVERTAKE OF NERAL CIRCUITRY OVER OUR THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS THAT REQUIRES VERY DEDICATED VERY PERSISTENT AND VERY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS IN ORDER TO STOP THOSE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS AND THE ANXIETY THAT LINKS THEM SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVELY BY TEACHING PEOPLE TO TOLERATE THAT LEVEL OF INCREASE ANXIETY AND INTERRUPT THOSE PATTERNS AND FORTUNATELY AS WE DESCRIBED EARLIER SUCH TREATMENTS EXIST COGNA BEHAVIORAL THERAPY DRUG TREATMENTS LIKE ASCESSORIZAL THOUGH ALSO DRUG TREATMENTS THAT TAP IN TO THE GLUDIMATE SYSTEM AND INTO PERHAPS ALSO THE DOPAMEANS ESS THAN THE SO CALLED NER ELEPTICS AND THEND AS WE DESCRIBED THERE'S NOW AN EXTENSIVE EXPLORATION F THINGS LIKE KEDEMINE SYLICEIBEN CANABUSTS THE INITIAL STUDIES DON'T SEEM TO HOLD MUCH PROMISE FOR CANIBUS AND C B D AND THE TREATMENT OF OS D BUT WHO KNOWS MAY BE MORE STUDIES WILL COME ALONG THAT WILL CHANGE THAT STORY THEN OF COURSE BRAIN MACHINE IN HER FACE LIKE TRANSCRANUAL MAGNEC STIMULATION AND THEN JUST TO REMIND YOU WHAT I ALREADY TOLD YOU BEFORE COMMINATIONS OF BEHAVIORAL AND DRUG TREATMENTS AND BRAY MACHINE IN HER FACE I THINK IT'S REALLY WEARE THE FUTURE LIES FORTUNATELY GOOD TREATMENTS EXIST WE CANNOT SAY THAT ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY THERE ARE FAIRLY LARGE PERCENTAGES OF PEOPLE THAT WON'T RESPOND TO ONE SET OF TREATMENTS OR ANOTHER AND THEREFORE ONE HAS TO TRIED DIFFERENT ONES AND THEN THERE ARE THE SO CALLED SUPPLEMENTATION BASED OR MORE HOLISTIC THERAPIES TO DAY I HAVE TRIED TO COVER EACH AND ALL OF THESE IN OF FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DETAIL I REALIZE THIS IS A FAIRLY LONG EPISODE THAT IS INTENTIONAL MUCH LIKE OUR EPISODE ON  D H D ON ATTENTION DEFIS IT HYPERACTIVIY DISORDER I RECEIVED AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF REQUESTS TO TALK ABOUT OS D AND MY DECISTION TO MAKE THIS A VERY LONG AND DETAILED EPISODE ABOUT OS D REALLY DOESN'T STEM FROM ANY DESIRE TO SUBJECTED TO TOO MUCH INFORMATION OR TO AVOID THE OPPORTUNITY TO JUST LIST THINGS OFF WHAT IAVE TRIED TO PROVIDE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY DRILL DEEP INTO THE NARL CIRCUITRY AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE OS D COMES FROM HOW OC D IS DIFFERENT FROM THINGS LIKE THE PERSONALITY DISORDERS THAT I DESCRIBE AND ALSO TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW THE INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOUR AND DRUG TREATMENTS WORK AND PERHAPS DON'T WORK SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY MAKE THE BEST IN FORM CHOICES AGAIN HIGHLYING THE FACT THAT OS D IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON EXTREMELY COMMON AND YET EXTREMELY DEBILITATING CONDITION AND ONE THAT I HOPE THAT IF ANY OF YOU HAVE OR THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE THOT HAVE IT THEY YIELD BOTH GAIN SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH PERHAPS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SOME THE INFORMATION PRESENTED TO DAY AND MAY BE HELPED THEM DIRECT THEIR TREATMENT FIND BETTER TREATMENT AND OF COURSE APPLY THOSE TREATMENTS FOR SOME RELIEF IF YOUR LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBED OUR UTO CHANNEL THAT'S A TERRIFIC ZERO COSTWAY TO SUPPORT US IN ADDITION PLEASE

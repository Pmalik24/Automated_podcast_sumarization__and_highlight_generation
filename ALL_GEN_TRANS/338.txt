AS IF SOMEBODY MIGH HAVE BEEN SHUT OUT OF THE HOUT WITH ALL OF THEM YOU KNOW ALL OF THE A OBJECTS INSIDE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THEORIES WAS THAT YOU AR THE FATHER DIE AT DO THE SAME TIMES THE SONS AT TO GO TO WOR IS WOORD LOOKING AT PAPERS A TALK ABOUT WORST AR NAN YOUND THINKING ABOUT HOW A COUPLE OF OF VANCE WITH OLD FATHER AND A COUPLE OF SONS COULD VERY QUICKLY FINISH THE FAMILY I REMEMBER FINDING ON INFORMATION ABOUT BEDDING I THINK WE SAW I THINK THEY WERE TICKETS OR A SCANDUL OF A DOG TRACK OR A HORSE RACING TRACK AND THE STORY WE MADE UP WAS OH THESE PEOPLE HAD LOST ALL THEIR MONEY GAMBLEN WE NEEDED TO FIND SOMEONE WHO COUL GIVE US SOME ANSWERS A PERSON WHO KNEW THE FAMILY OR A DISTANT RELATIVE FREEDOM'S A SMALL TOWN SOME ONE MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHEN WE'D GO ASK DOWN AT THE GENERAL STORE OR THE POST OFFICE PEOPLE GAVE US THE COLD SHOLDER THIS CONFIRMED TO US THAT THEY WERE PART OF THE CONSPIRACY TO BRING THIS FAMILY DOWN OR AT LEAST PART OF THE COVER UP IN RETROSPECT I REALIZED THE ADULTS MAY HAVE BRUSHED US OFF BECAUSE WE WERE TWELVE YEARS OLD TITE WAS DAVYD WO FOUND THE BREAK THROUGH CLUE A MATCHBOOK MATCHES AN TACT SOILED BUT LEGIBLE IT SAID STOP AN SHOP AT NASON GROCERY FREEDOM SIDE NEAR EFFINGHAM FALSE BRIDGE WE RODE OVER AND DITCHED OUR BIKES UNDER THE BRIDGE THERE WERE TWO OR THREE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE ALL BIG OLD VICTORIAN BUILDINGS BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS TO US WHICH ONE WAS THE NASON GROCERY THERE WERE COUPLE OF ANCIENT GASPOMPS OUTSIDE AND ARRUSTING MOXY SODA SIGN A ROPE HELD THE DOOR CLOSED BUT WE WERE ABLE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH THE FIRST THING I SAW WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE DOOR WERE THE BOXES OF CORNFLAKES THAT LINED THE WALLS THE NASON GROCERY WAS A COMPLETELY INTACT PERFECTLY PRESERVED STORE FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WITH PRODUCTS STILL ON THE SHELVES BY THE CASH REGISTER THERE WERE MAGAZINE RACKS AND ROWS OF CANDY THERE WERE GLASS COUNTERTOPS DISPLAYING FISHING YEAR AND STACKS OF CAN VEGETABLES CORN AND GREEN BEANS SOME OF THE CANS AT EXPLODED FROM YEARS OF HEATING AN FREEZING WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS COOL UPSTAIRS THERE WERE A FEW ROOMS THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN APARTMENT BEING IN A STORE ALL OF THE SUDDEN REMINDED US CEG KNOW A WE'RE BREAKING AT ENTERING IN A PLACE THAT'S GOT YOU KNOW CANDY THERE WAS A SMALL SAFE UNDER THE COUNTER AND WHEN I TURNED THE HANDLE THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN INSIDE I FOUND FOUR SILVER DOLLARS AND THREE KENNEDY HALF DOLLARS I ALSO FOUND A FIVE DOLLAR GOLD COIN FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO I TOOK THE COINS AL I SPENT THE EIGHTH GREAT KIND OF DETACHED FROM SCHOOL I STARE OUT THE WINDOW AT THE FALLING STOWN AND THINK ABOUT THE DRIFTS THAT MUST HAVE BEEN BLOWING THROUGH CRACKS IN THE HOUSE OR I'D LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT AND IMAGINE OW STILL IN COLD IT WOULD BE IN THERE INSTEAD OF DOING HOME WORK I SPENT A LOT OF TIME READING THROUGH MY BOX OF NASON LETTERS DRAWING UP AE FAMILY TREE FROM THE CLUES WE'D FOUND EVERY REFERENCE TO NEW HAMPSHIR BECAME RELEVENT TO THE MYSTERY I SIT AT BREAKFAST AND STARE AT A TIN OF MAPLE SYRUP AND THINK ABOUT THE NASONS I WAS PRETTY SURE THAT IF THERE WAS SOME WAY I COULD SUPPORT A FAMILY RESEARCHING ABANDON HOUSES THEAT IT WOULD BE MY VOCATION IN LIFE I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD AND I'D A CRUSH ON A HOUSE I HADN'T TOLD MY PARENTS MUCH ABOUT IT I WAS AFRAID THEY'D SHUT US DOWN OVER FEARS WE'D GET HURT OR ARRESTED BUT I REMEMBER FEELING THAT I WANTED A GROWN UP TO SEE IT TO CONFIRMED THAT WE HAD AN IMAGINE THE WHOLE THING SO I STARTED TO TELL MY MOTHER ABOUT IT BUT I COULD SEE I WASN'T GETTING IN ACROSS HOW AMASING IT WAS SO THAT SPRING I LED MY MOTHER ACROSS THE FIELD OF WEEDS AND WATCHED AS SHE CLIMBED THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE I WAS LITTLE APPAULD MORE THAN APPAUT WHEN I WENT INSIDE IT WAS MUCH MORE I MUCH GREATER DISASTER THAN I HADNET

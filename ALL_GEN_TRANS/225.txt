ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW YOU SHOULD GO BY ETHER CAS LIE GIT'S ABOUT TO GO UP BE YET I JUST LHING TO DO THAT BUT YET ITS ABELT  THAT'S WHATTIN HAPPENE SHORTLY A TO SAY THI'S KIND OF AMAZING SITTING THERE WATCHING THE NUMBERS GO UP KNOWING THAT THIS WAS AS CLOSE TO A SORE THING AS I WOULD EVER GAT OSE I FREE MONEY RIT THERE BUT I'M I DID BYININ BY MONDAY THE AVERAGE PRICE OF ATHER HAD RISEN FROM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S IN ONE DAY WHEN DOUBLE  OSOM MEND TOF THE FIFTY APES WHO SIND UP ON ADAM'S LIST TUTHE SPECIAL OLD PRICE OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS EACH OF THEM NOW ON SOMETHING WORTH FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A LITTLE HIER YET LITTLE BIT BETTER SO THIS CIS COULD JUST GET OUT AND THOUGH 'VE JUST MADE OUT LIKE BANDITS AL READY YES YES SO BUT OUT EM'S DOING IS WORKING YES YOU JUST WITERY LIKE KIND OF ROLD YOUR EYES TE MATTER SO THE REASON THAT I ROLLD MY EYES IS BECAUSE LIKE IT'S IT'S AS YER SOME THINGS SO LIKE SOME ONE'S MAKING MONEY THE MATTER WHAT AND WHEN THEY DO THERE MEANS SOME ONE'S LOSING MONEY AND BASICALLY THE EARLIER YOU ARE THE BETTER IT IS IF YOU KNOW TES BEFOR OTHER PEOPLE BASLAY TOR ONE OF THESE PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE OUT REALLY WELL N LAT'S OF OTHER PEOPLE CAN BELIEVES LOSE MONEY T WE SAEING IN HIS VIEW IS A CLASSIC PUMPAN DOM SOMETHING THAT IF YEU DID T IN THE STOCK MARKET WOULD BE WHODLY WEGAL THE APES GET IN EARLY TALK UP A THERN TWITTER EN COURAGE OTHER PEOPLETO BY WHICH PUSHES UP THE PRICE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS WEN THE PRICES THE HIGHEST THEY SOU TIKING O QUICK ONSIZABLE PROFIT ABOUT THE HIPE THE AND OF TEAS PRICE FALLS IN ANYBODY LEFT HOLDING IT TAKES A BEATING LOSE MONEY FACT TO DAY IN THE MONTHS SINCE THAT DAY WHEN ADAM WEGANCHED ATHER THE PRICEIS PLOMETED IT'S NOW DOWN AS WELL AS NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS SOME DAYS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE EARLY BOOMING DAYS ON IS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I DON'T THINK THAT MANY PEOPS MADE PEOPLE AS YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE MONEY LIKE EVERY APNING HERE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO DO OKE BUT IT'S I CAN BE GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE ELSE IE HUP ON THE TRAIN LAST AND THAT'S WHAT KEN THINGS IS KND OF EVIL ABOUT THE WORLD OF AN OF TES WHY THINKS THERE IS SCAM AND SHOULDN'T EXIST SEEING OW THIS MAY ME WONDER IF ANY OF THIS IS ACTUALLY ILWEGAL AND I'VE NOW TALK TO A BUNCH OF LAWYERS ABOUT IT LAWYERS WHO DEAL WITHAN OF TEAS AND CRIPTO AND SECURITY FRAUD AND PUTTING TWO WHO ADVISE COMPANIES THAT RELASAN OF TEAS AND I DESCRIBED WHAT I SAW ADAMAC BRIDE DO IN RELAUNCHING ATHER AND ALL OF THEM TOLD ME THAT AND IF TEAS ARE SO NEW THE LAWIS STILL PRETTY VAGUE THERE'VE BEEN MANY LOS SUITS OR MUCH GOVERNMENT INFORCEMENT IN AN OUF TEAS BUT THEY POINTE TO TWO THINGS THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC LOOK AT FIRST IF ADAM IN THE APES WERE PUMPING AND DUMPING SPECIFICALLY IF THEY WERE LYING ABOUT EITHER WORE ABOUT THEIR OWN TRADING THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE LIKE IF THEY WERE GOING UNTO TWITTER AND TELLING PEOPLE THAT EITHERE IS A GREAT INVESTMENT WORTH SEEKING MONEY AND TWO FOR THE LONG RUN BUT THEN IF THEY THEMSELVES ONLY HELD ON TO IT FOR A FEW DAYS UNTI THE RICE ROSE AND THEN THEY SOLD IT THAT WOULD BE A WEGAL THAT WOULD BE MARKET MANIPULATION THE SECOND THING THE LAWERS POINTY TO TRANSPARENCY IS KEY IF ADAM I WAS GOING OUT GIVING A SPECIAL PRICE TO FIFTY PEOPLE TO GENERATE BUS AN EXCITEMENT THAT IS A NORMAL KIND OF PROMOTION AND LOTS OF INDUSTRIES WHEN BOYER SAYS HE SAID THAT COUND BE FINE BUTHE KEY TO THAT BEING OF CAY IS IT ADAM WOULD NEED TO DISCLOSE IT ALL PUBLICLY SO THAT ANY POSSIBLE INVESTOR CAN FIND OUT THAT SOME PEOPLE GOT A SPECIAL CHEOPER PRICE THADAM DIDN'T DO THAT HE OULD BE DANGER OF SOME INVESTER THEY BE SOMBOTY LOST MONEY THEY TER SUING HIM OVER HOLDING BACK THAT INFORMATION OOK AT SO WAS ADAM CROSSING THE LINE INTO ILLEGALITY WITH EITHER OF THOSE THINGS GEN STOLD IN THAT PROOF IN THAT EITHER WAY AS OR THE BT THAT MYSTERIOUS BOT PURCHASE A THOUSAND PICK SOM MAPTILES A FORTH OF ALL THE TILES KN STARTED AWAY THERE WAS SOMEONE MUCH MORE SINISTER THEN ADAM BEHIND THE POT ONE DAY TECTS ME PANIC ABOUT WHAT H'S LEARNING ABOUT THE POT SO SCARED ABOUT IT THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW IF HE WANTS TO GO ON THE RADIO ANY MORE IK ES THIS WORT PARTIS JUST AN CONFRY GELL LIKE AN IS JUS IS IS  IT SOMHA FIGURE AN  I THINKE THET O ACCOUNT THAT ON YOU DELL IS JUST MUCH MUCH BIGGER HE SENT ME A SCREEN SHOT THAT SHOWD THAT THE COUNT HAD DONE NEARLY TWO BILIAN

THEY HAVE LOUT OF MONEY I DON'T I DON'T THINK HE'S SI THIS TE KED ERTLIN YES MAY BE WORKING FOR THI STRUP OR SOMETHING THAT HE'S NOT AVE I DON'TLY SMART ENOUGH TO BE LIK THIS YOU WOULN'T BE DOING WHAT

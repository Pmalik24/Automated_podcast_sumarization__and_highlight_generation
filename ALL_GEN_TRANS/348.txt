WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANACONTANCE  OF SCIENCE SCIENCE ACE TO FOR  I MENJER HUBERMEN AND ON UR PROFESSOR OF NEROBIOLOGY AND OPTOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDISON MY GUES TO DAY IS DOCTOR AND PROFESSOR MARKDES BOZITO DOCTOR MARKDES BOZITO IS A NEUROLOGIST AND A PROFESSOR OF NEURO SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OVE CALIFORNIA BERKLY HE IS A WORLD EXPERT IN THE BRAIN MECHANISMS CONTROLLING EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND MEMORY EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IS THE WAY IN WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO DESIGNATE AND CARRY OUT SPECIFIC COGNITIVE STRATEGIES AND IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO EVERY ASPECT OF OUR DAILY LIVES AND BECAUSE SO MUCH OF BEING EFFECTIVE IN DAILY LIFE INVOLVES USING SPECIFIC CONTEXT RELEVANT BATCHES OF INFORMATION IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO AND WHEN AND WHAT NOT TO DO AND WHEN AND TO COME UP WITH STRATEGIES THAT ARE VERY ADAPTIVE FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIPS WORK SCHOOL AND ATHLETICS AND ON AND ON THERE IS REALLY NO SEPARATION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND MEMORY AND TO DAY DOCTOR DESBOZITO EXPLAINS THE NERAL CIRCUITS CONTROLLING EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND MEMORY HOW THEY INTERACT THE KEY ROLE OF DOPOMINE IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND SOMETHING CALLED WORKING MEMORY AND TEACHES US WAYS TO OPTIMIZE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND MEMORY THAT IS HOW TO OPTIMIZE COGNITIVE FNCTION IN ADDITION TO DISCUSSING HOW TO OPTIMIZE COGNIVE FUNCTION IN THE HEALTHY BRAIN TODAY'S DISCUSSION ALSO CENTERS AROUND HOW TO RESTORE COGNIVE FUNCTION IN DISEASE OR INJURY CONDITIONS THAT DEPLETE EXECUTVE FUNCTION AND MEMORY SUCH AS TREMATIC BRAIN INJURY CONCUSSION ALSHEIMERS PARKINSONS AND ATTENTION DEFISITE DISORDERS DOCTOR DESPOZITO SHARES WITH US RESEARCH FINDINGS BOTH ABOUT BEHAVIORAL INFORMICOLOGIC STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND MEMORY BY THE END OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED FROM DOCTOR DES BOZITO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT THE MODERN UNDERSTANDING OF COGNITION THAT IS THINKING AND MEMORY AND THE CARRYING OUT OF SPECIFIC COGNIVE STRATEGIES YOU WILL ALSO LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT HOW TO OPTIMIZE BRAIN FUNCTION AND BRAIN HEALTH BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME ID LIKE TO THINK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS MAWE NEWE VENISON NOW WE KNEW EVENISON IS THE MOST NEUTRIANT DENSE AND DELICIOUS RED MEAT AVAILABLE HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST AND THERE'S GENERAL CONSENSIS THAT MOST PEOPLE SHOULD STRIVE TO CONSUME APPROXIMATELY ONE GRAM OF PROTINE PERPOUND OF BODYWEIGHT NOW WHEN ONE STRIVES TO DO THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY OE THAT PROTING AN TAKE TO THE CALORY RATIO BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO CONSUME AN EXCESS OF CALORIES WHEN TRYING TO GET THAT ONE GRAM OF PROTINE PERPOUND OF BODYWEIGHT NOW WE KNEW EVENISON HAS AN EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY PROTING TO CALORY RATIO SO IT MAKES GETTING THAT ONE GRAM OF P ROTINE PROPOUND A BODYWEIGHT EXTREMELY EASY IT'S ALSO DELICIOUS PERSONALLY I LIKE THE GROUND VENISE AND ILE SO LIKE THE VENISON STAKES AND THEN FOR CONVENIENCE WHEN 'M ON THE ROAD I LIKE THE JERKEY THE JERKEY IS A VERY HIGH PROTINE TO CALORY RATIO SO IT HAS AS MUCH AS TEN GRAMS OF PROTINE PURR JERKY STICK AND HAS SOMETHING LIKE ONLY LIKE FIFTY FIVE CALORIES SO AGAIN MAKING A VERY EASY TO GET ENOUGH PROTINE WITHOUT CONSUMING EXCESS CALORIES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRY MAWENEWE VENISON CAN GO TO MAWE NEWE VENISON DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER AGAIN THAT'S MAWENEE VENISON DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY JU JUVE MAKES MEDICAL GRADE RED LIGHT THEROPY DEVICES NOW THERE'S ONE THING I'VE CONSISTENTLY EMPHASIZE ON THIS PODCAST IS THE INCREDIBLE ROLL THAT LIGHT CAN HAVE ON OUR BIOLOGY OF COURSE I'M ALWAYS TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD GET SUNLIGHT IN THEIR EYES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER WAKING ON AS MANY DAYS OF THEIR LIFE AS POSSIBLE FOR SAKE OF SETTING CERCANIN RHYTHM DAYTIME MOODFOKUS AN ALERTNESS AND IMPROVE SLEEP NOW IN ADDITION TO SUNLIGHT RED LIGHT AND NERIN FRED LIGHT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE POSSIVE EFFECTS ON IMPROVING NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF CELLAR AND ORGAN HEALTH INCLUDING FASTER MUSCLE RECOVERY IMPROVED SKIN HEALTH AND WOUND HEALING EVEN IMPROVEMENTS IN ACNEY OR THAT IS REMOVAL OF ACNEY REDUCING PAIN AND INFLAMMATION IMPROVING MYT A CONJURAL FUNCTION AND EVEN IMPROVING VISION ITSELF WHAT SETS JUVE APART AND WHY IT'S MY PREFERRED RED LIGHT THERAPY DEVICE IS THAT IT HAS CLINICALLY PROVING WAVELINGS MEANING IT USES SPECIFIC WAVELENGTHS OF RED LIGHT AND NER IM PRED LIGHT INCOMBINATION THAT TRIGGER THE OPTIMAL CELLAR ADAPTATIONS PERSONALLY I USE THE HAND HELD JUVE EVERY DAY THE HENHEL JUV IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A THICK PIECE OF TOAST AND I ALSO OWN A JUVE PANEL THAT ALLOWS FOR FULL BODY EXPOSURE AND I USE THAT ONE APPROXIMALELY FIVE TIMES PER WEEP FOR ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES PURCESSION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRY JUVE YOU CAN GO TO JUVE DOC ALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO RECEIVE FIFTY DOLLARS OFF YOUR FIRST PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S JUVE SPELL JE OH O VV DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET FIFTY DOLLARS OFF YOUR FIRST PURCHAS TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY OV SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE NOW A KEY COMPONENT OF GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS THAT IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TEMPERATURE CHANGES ACCURR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES AT THE BEGINNING AND THROUGHOUT AND AT THE END OF YOUR NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IS TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S WHAT EIGHT SLEEP ALLOWS YOU TO DO IT ALLOWS YOU TO PROGRIN THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR MATTRESS AND SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT SUCH THAT YOU FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP EASILY AND WAKE UP EACH MORNING FEELING INCREDIBLY REFRESHED AND ENERGIST I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON AN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR AL OST THREE YEARS NOW AND IT HAS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF MY SLEEP IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOK CALM SLSH HUBERMEN TO GET A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE MATTRESS COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IND THE OU ESS A CANDIDA OU K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE U AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR MARKED DESPOSITO DOCTOR DESPOSITO WELCOME I ANDYOUR THANK YOU SO MUCH FROVIDING ME REALLY LOOK CAN FORWARD OUR CONVERSATION YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER ME BUT I REMEMBER YOU WHEN I WAS A FIRST YEAR GRADUATES TO AND A YOU SHOWED UP IT BERKELEY ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO REALLY BRING FUNCTIONAL IMAGING OF THE HUMAN BRAIN TO BERKLEY BRING A NEUROLOGY AND A CLINICAL UM EMPHASIS TO THE NURSINT STUDIES THERE IN ITS REALLY JUST A BLOSSOMED AND IT'S BEEN A REAL THRILL FOR ME TO SEE ALL THE MAGNIFICENT WORK OUT OF YOUR LABORATORY OVER THE YEARS AND I KNOW YOU ALSO STILL SEE PATIENT SO THE TOPICS THAT ARE OF INTEREST TO YOU I KNOW OF GREAT INTEREST TO OUR AUDIENCE OU WO JUST START OFF WITH A FEW OF THE BASICS AND IM DO LITTLE FUNCTIONAL NERR ANADOMY LESSON FOR FOLKS NOT TO SCARE ANY ONE DON'T WORRY THIS WILL BE ACCESSIBLE T EVERYONE AND JUST TALK ABOUT THE FRONTA LOABES AND PREFRONT OF QUARTAX AND A A BIT OF WHAT THOSE STRUCTURES DO BECAUSE MANY TIMES ON THIS POD CASSAPS AT OKE THE NEURL REAL ESTATE RIGHT BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD IS INVOLVED IN CONTECTS AND PLANNING AT CETERA BUT YOU'RE THE REAL EXPERT HERE AM HOW SHOULL WE THINK ABOUT WHAT THE FRONT O LOABES DO AND AND THEIR VERYUS ROLLS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE YES SO THERES FOR LOABES THIS AFFRONTOLOAVES PRIDE AL TONPRAL EXCEPAT AL AND THE FRONTAOLOAVES PRY TAKE UP MORE DO TAKE UP MORE TERRITORY THAN A TOS PRY ABOUT A THIRD OF OF THE QARTEX AND WITHIN THE FRONT TO LOABES III DON'T I'M GET TO USE SIR FRONTO LOAVES FRY IN OUR CONPRESENTIONA LAPA WHAT I REALLY MEAN AS THE PREFRONT OF UARTEX SO WITHIN THE FRONTO LOAVES THERE'S ALSO MOT AREAS AT PORNT FOR MOTOR FUNCTION AS WELL A BUT MORE TALK ABOUT THE FRONTOLOVE TE TONK ABOUT ITS YOU KNOWN BALMAN HIGHER LEVEL TOLKING A BILL IS REALL TALKI ABOUT THE PREFRONTAL QARTAX AND THIS IS WHAT'S CONSIDERED SIR THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF QARTEX IN THE BRAIN SO YE  WHEN YOU THINK IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OT PEOPLE A SIGN IT ALL SORTS OF FUNCTIONS ALMOST EVERY FUNCTION THINK OF PEOPLE SOR PUT INTO THE FRONTO LVES BUT I THINK WHAT WE'VE ALL CONCONNIC A MOVE TOWARDS US THIS IDEA OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION THIS ABILT THIS ABILITY TOS TO PLAN TO ORGANIZE A TO REALLY TRANCE FOR OUR THOUGHTS YOU KNOW INTO AN ACTION AND REALLY TO BE GUIDED BY GOALS AND AND INTENTIONS AND NOT BE KIND OF TAKE IN A KIND OF RULED BY SORT OF JUST AUTOMATIC BEHAVIORS D A WORD WE USE IN COGNER SCIENCEIS CALL COGNAV CONTROL SO CO MANTROL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS WHAT WE ATTRIBUTE TO THE FRONT TOLOE AND SO YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS YOU KNOW THE SEAT EL OF THE BRAIN OR THE I YUNORE THE CONDUCTOR OF THE ARCHIST ARE REALLY THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT'S THAT'S REALLY CONTROLLING THE THE THE REST OF THE BRAIN SO YET YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE WHICH PART YOU WANTED NOT LEAVE HOME THIT'S YOUR FRONT IS YOUR FRONTALOPES SPEAKING OF WHICH A WHAT AR SOME OF THE A SYMPTOMS OF MILD FRONTA LOBE DAMAGE UM AN SEVERE FRONT O LOBE DAMAGE A DAMAGE BROUGHT ABOUT EITHER THROUGH A NERGE GENER OF DISEASE OR PHYSICAL INJURY I KN ORGAN TO TALK A BIT ABOUT BOTH TO DAY OR A LOT ABOUT BOTH UM BUT HOW WOULD LACK OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION A SHOW UP UM MAYBE ON INKINT OF A SUBTLE LEVEL YE I MEAN AT FIRST IC SOULD SAY THAT IT SHOWS UP ALL THE TIME BECAUSE WHEN WHEN AND IN FRONT A LOW BEHAVIOURIS PROBABLY MUCH MORE PREVALENT THAN THAN WE REALIZE CERTAINLY WE THINK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU HAVE A BRAIN INJURY TO THE FRONTOLOVS AND THERE'S LOTS OF NEROLOGICAL DISORDERS LIKE STROKE CAN TERMACBRANE RY NOWCIMERSTHES THAT CAN AFFECT IN FRONTOLOPE AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF FENO PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUBSESSIVE COMBULSIVE DISORDER AND KETS OF FRENDY AND DEPRESSION THAT AR THOUGHT TO BE FRONTOLOPE IS FUNCTION BUT WHEN YOUR SLEEP DEPRIVED AND WHEN YOUR STRESS AND JUST NORMAL AGING THE FRONTALOVES SEEMS TO BE THE FIRST SYSTEM THAT'S AFFECTED BECAUSE IT REALLY IS INVOLOP IN THE HIGHEST LEVEL SO WHEN WE'RE HAVING A BAD DAY WHEN WE'RE HAVING DIFFICULT THE SORT OF SETTING PRIORTIES OM E'RE HAVING DIFFICULTIES ACHIEVING THE GOAL THAT WE'VE SET OUT WHEN WE GET DISTRACT YOU KNOW WHEN WE GET DISTRACTED U YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO SERVE A DAFT AND BEFLEXIBLE THESE ARE ALL THE TYPE OF THINGS TAT AR REFLECT THAT OUR FRONTOLOVES ARE NOT FUNCTIONING OBTIMATELY APPROXIMATELY WHAT AGE DOES THE FRONTO LOBE CIRCUITRY A COME ON LINE SO TO SPEAK MEAN WHEN I SEE A BABY A BABIES CAN ORIENT THEIR EYES TOWARDS THINGS BUT THEY'RE RATHER REFLECTIVE IN IN WHERE THEY'LL PLACE THEIR EYES BUT UM BY TIME KIDS OR THREE OR FOUR THEY CON CERTAINLY PLAY WITH BLOCKS OR INTRACTED WITH OTHER CHILDREN OR THEIR PARENTS BUT IT SEEMS THAT BEN FULL FUNCTIONALITY THE FRONTALOVES IS IS REALLY GRADUAL AT LEAST THAT'S MY NON CLINICALLY TRAIND TO SESSIMENT YE I MEAN THIT'S A REALLY TOUGH QUESTION TO KNOW WHEN THEY'RE FULLY DEVELOPED BECAUSE THESE STUDIES HAVEN DONE WHEN EMOR I WAS INTRODUCE SOMEWHE'RE ABLE TO SOR IMAGE THE BRAIN IN A NONAVASE OF WAY A THAN STUDIES ITS TART TO COME OUT TRYING TO SUREMAP OUT AT WHAT AGE DOES YOUR FRONTOLOVES FULLY DEVELOP AND IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS EARLY INTO YOUR YOUR TWENTIES UM IYOU KNOW ALWAYS SAY THAT IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT YOU CAN'T RENT TO CAR AN TO YOUR TWENTY FIVE AT THE ANSURANCE COMPANIES KNEW BEFORE NOUR SCIENTIST IT IS TO WHEN YOUR FRONTOLOVES HAVE YOU KNOW WHEN YOURE DECISION MAKING SKILLS AT THEIR HIGHESTS AND SO THAT'S PROBABLY BOUT RIGHT AND TO YOUR TWENTIES UM IS PROLLY BEFORE YOUR FRONT LOVES OF FULLY DEVELOPED AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHAT WHY DOES IT TAKES SO LONG IT'S THE AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT TAKES THE LONGEST TO DEVELOP AND WHY IS THAT AND I THINK THERE'S A REASON I THINK HAT T THIS SORT OF SLOW DEVELOPED OF FRONTALOVES ALLOWS US TO TO EXPLORER ALLOWS US TO THINK AB OT NOVEL WAYS OF SOLVIN PROBLEMS ALLOWS US TO TAKE IN THE WORLD IF THEY WERE SHUT OFF EARLIER AH IT WOUL  WOULD LEAD TO MA BE MUCH MORE SORT OF RIGID KIND OF YOU KNOW LESS FLEXIBLE KIND OF A BEHAVIOR THATTHAT WOUD SEEM THINK SO I SO I THINK THAT THAT IT HELPS TO BE I TAKE A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP BUT ALSO IT OBVIOUSLY LEADS TO SOME PROBLEMS SOMETIMES  INADOLESCENCES S AS WE SEE SOMETIMES CAN ONE SEE A LACK OF FRONT O LOW MATURITY IN JUST THE SHEER NUMBER OF PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS THAT A CHILD MAKES AM SO FOR INSTANCE IN A CLASS ROOM OF I YOU KNOW THAT SAY UM YOU KNOW FOURTH GRATERS UM OFTEN TIMES THEY'LL BE A RANGE OF U APPARENT OF ABILITY OF KIDS TO SIT STILL OR TO LISTEN UM DO WE THINK THAT THE KID THAT'S HAVING A HARD TIME FOCUSSING AND LISTENING TO INSTRUCTIONS OR STEADYING THEIR BODY WHEN THEY'RE TOLD TO SIT STILL UM I NOW IF THEY STILL TELL CONSIST SAID I KHEOLL BUT THE WOULD TELL ME A SIT STILL I I WAS A KID AM IS THAT AM SOMEHOW REFLECTIVE OF A YOU KNOW SLIGHTLY LAGGING FRONT OF FRONTOLOE FUNCTION UM AND MATURITY WHEREAS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE KIDS THET CONSIT YOU KNOW STILL IN STOI CON FOCUS DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY'RE LOW BIT MORE ACCELERATED ALONG THAT TRAJECTORY YET'S HARD TO SAY I MEAN THE FRONTELOBE IS BIG AS A BIG TERRITORY AND WE CAN GET INTO IT BUT THERE'S YOU KNOW THE RONT LO PROBABLY HAS TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENCE SOB REGIONS WITHIN IT AND AND SO GROSSLY WE THINK ABOUT THE FRONTELOBES AS THE LATTAL PORTION OF THE FRONT TELOBES OF WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THESE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION PROBLY SUPPORTS THESE EXECIVE FUNCTABILITIES BUT THEN WE'VE GOT ANOTHER PART OFTHE FRONT EOVES CALLED THE ORMAL FRONTAL CORTEX WAS PROLLY VALLE MORE IN SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE THINK AGAIN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FRONT ALLO BEHAVIORS A THEY CANT  YOU HAVE TO BREAK THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPE OFFRONT AL BEHAVOR SO THAT TIGE BEHAVOR WHICH MAY BE VOVED INCE OR BEING ABLE TO INHIBIT YOU KNOW YOUR MOTOR MOVEMENTS OR MAYBE NOT BEING DISTRACTED MAY REFLECT THAT THAT SYSTEM IS A LITTLE BIT DELAYED BUT IT COULD BE THAT ANOTHER SYSTEM THE ONE THAT'S INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND ORGANIZES YOU KNOWIS MORE DEVELOPED THAN I DI I DO THINK THEY THEY DEVELOP AT DIFFERENT TRADECTORIES SO WIH THE FRONTA LOAVES ESSENTIALLY AM SERVING AN EXECUTIVE OR SEE O TIGHT FUNCTION GOL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR INTENTIONS COGNAIVE CONTROL ON THESE ARE THE TERMS YOU USED U WHERE ARE THE RULES WHAT DO THE RULES LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW AND I THINK ABOUT BRAIN FUNCTION ORS AVE SPENT ONE MY LIFE THINKING ABOUT THINK ABOUT CHEMICAL AN ELECTRICAL SIGNALLING BETWEEN NERANS DIFFERENT ERONS COMMUNICATING MORE OR LESS AT A GIVEN MOMENT REFLECTING  SOME SORT OF CIRCUIT AS WE CALL IT AND THEN SOME BEHAVIOR OR SOME DECISION COMES OUT AND IF I FOR INSTANCE U I TO GET MY DRIVER'S LICENCE RENEWED SENCE SO IF I GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES WHAT A LOVELY EXPERIENCE THAT IS A THE MOMENT I GET THERE TAT I ISFOR LOCK HIM TO A CERTAIN RULE SET UM WHEN I'M HOME I'M IN A DIFFERENT RULE SET WHEN I'M IN MY FRIENDS VERSES WHENT IM WITH MY PARENTS A DIFFERENT RULE SETS AND SEEMS AT THE FRONT O LO IS REALLY GOOD IT UM DRAWING ON CONTEXT BASE ON KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE ONE IS UM AND THEN COMING UP WITH CONAVE ALGARITHMS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE OR INAPPROPRIATE TO RUN IN THAT CONTEXT BUT WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THESE ALGARITHMS ARE THEY UM OF THE O KAY SHUT DOWN ALL UM CURSING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT UM O QET YOURE FREETOD JUST QUOTING  BE YOU I MEAN WHEN E REALY COMES DOWN TO IT IHAS SOME INTERESTING PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECTS TOO BECAUSE I JUST BE YOURSELF BE AUTHEN TIY BE VULNERABLE YOU'ALL THESE THINGS I MAKE SENSE BUT OF COURSE ONE NEEDS TO BE APPROPRIATE WITH THE CONTEXT SO  O THIS WORK LIKE WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT ARE THE ALGARITHMS HOW HOWOS HIS WORK IG BECAUSE ECAUSE THAT'S A PRETTY COMMON EXAMPLE OF OUR PATIENCE THAT THEY THEY DON'T FOLLOW TE RULES M THEY THEY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SITTING IN A SOME ONE' OUGHT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND THE PHONED RINGS YOU KNOW NOT TO PICK UP HIS PHONE BUT  THE PATIENTS DON'T AND THAT THEY MAY PICK UP THE PHONE THERES THERES IS A DOTOR LOMEAT WHO'S A A NOROLIGIS FROM FRANCE PUBLISH THESE BEAUTIFUL PAPERS IN THE AITIES OF ALL THESE THINGS THAT PATIENCE DID THAT JUST THAT BROKE THE RULES AND AND SOAND BRING JUST KIND OF PULL TO THE THEIR ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT HAVING ANY CONTEXTS TO IT IF HE PUT A PAIR OF GLASSES ON THE TABLE AND DIDN'T ASK HIM TO PUT HEM N THEY WOULD PUT HEM ON EVEN IF THEY HAD A PAIR GLASSES ON A READY OR HE TOOK EM TO THEIR APARTMENT THAN THEY SAW THE BED AND THEY JUMP INTO H BED AND GO ON TO THE COVERS IR HE SAW HE HAD A NURSE AND SHE HE PUT A BLOOD PRESSURE COFF THERE AND SHE PICKED UP THE BLOOD PRESSURE COFFIN JUST START TAKING HIS BLOOD PRESSURE GAND NOT ASKING EM TO DO ANY THESE THINGS AND SO THEY THEY THEY JUST DON'T FOLLOW SORT OF THE SOCIAL RULES BUT THEY'RE THERE THEY THEY HAVEN'T LOST RULES IF YOU ASK THESE PATIENCE WAS THAT THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO THEY'LL SAY NO NO THEY KNOW IT THEY NOT THEY KNOW ITS APPROPRIATE YET THEY SHAY KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO ANSWER YOUR PHONE BUT  O O THEY KNOW BETTER BUT THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE IMEXACTLY SOAS IT'S IT'S SO YO IS NOT A BREAK DOWN AT THE RULES DISAPPEAR IS THAT THEY CAN'T APPLY THE RULE THAT THEY CAN'T APPLY THE RULES PROUGHT PROPERLY ANDN ND THAT'S TRUE FOR A LOT OF PPATIENCE EEVEN WITH KIDS YOU KNOW YOU TELL THEM I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT BEFORE DINNER BECAUSE FOR HAVING DINNER AND THEN THEYR SITTING THEIRE HAVING A SANWAYS AND YOU SAY WHAT IT I JUST TELL YOU YOU SAID WHALL DON'T EAT BUT IM I'M HUNGRY RIGHT A SIR ANOTHERS FOR EXAMPLES OR THE FRONTLOVES NOT COMPLETELY CANT OF DEVELOPED SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT RULES I I THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN YOU KNOW THE BRAIN PROCESSES INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY BUT IT ALSO STORE S INFORMATION THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT DOES HIS STORE ALL SORTES OF INFORMATIEN ALL OVER THE BRAIN AND I THINK WHAT THE FRONT AL LOVES DO AS THEY STORE RULES AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE WAY IT' STORES RULES THEY SEEM TO STORE THE RULES IN A HIGHARCHICAL FA ASSON UM AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS TO RULES I I LIKE TO GIVE THE EXAMPLEL OF A PLAYING GOLF I TELL STORY A LOT ABOUT MY GOOD FEREND BOB NIGHT WHEN HITS A BALL INTO THE YOU KNW OFF INTO THE WOODS AND HE HAS TO TRY AND HIT THE BALL OUT OF THE WOODS HE'S HOLDING ON TO ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RULES ON HOW A SUCCESSFULLY GET HIS BALL BACK TOWARDS THE GREEN SO THE THEMOST SIMPLEST ONE IS JUST LIKE WHERE IN A WHERE IS THE FLAT YOU KNOW I'VE GOT O MAINTAINED A A ORINTATIEN TO GET TO THE FLACK YOU KNOW SO HES HOLDIN THAT HE ALSO HAT A HIGHER LEVEL RULES HE KNOWS THAT IF HE KICKS THE BALL IT'S A PENALTY SO HE'S NOT AN A DO THAT RIGHTIN THEN AN ANOTHER HIGHER LEVEL RULE MIGHT BE IF I JUST KEEP DOING THIS YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS CAN BE HEALTHY FOR ME SO HES STORING ALL THIS INFORMATION AT SORT OF A DIFFERENT LEVES OF HIRE AND HE SUPPLONTES R APPLYING IT TO ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE THIS VERY SIMPLE ACT OF NOT SO SIMPLE ACT OF OF ING THE OFFALL SO YES SO I JUST I THINK ABOUT SOR THE FRONT AL CORT DICS IS ABLE TO CALL UPON THE RULE IN THE APPROPRIATE CONTACTS AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR FRONT TO LOVES IT IT IT DOESN'T GET PULLED UP PROPERLY AND THOSE RULES MUST BE LEARNED RIGHT THAT IT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN IMAGINE THAT ONE CAN BE BORN INTO THE WORLD WITH THESE RULES SETS AN UM I THINK ABUT THE THE TWO MARSHAMAL EXPERIMENT THAT'S OR FAMOUS NOW UM WERE KIDS ARE OFFERED TO EAT A ONE MARSHAMAUA RIGHT AWAY OR DIFFER AND GET TWO MARSHAMALOSHES A ADORABLE VIDIO ILY REISTRAGEDIES THEY USE LIKE TURNING AWAY AND POKING THE MARSHAMELLOW AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A SOME DEBATE ON GOING AS TO WHETHER NOT A SUCCESS WER LACK OF SUCCESS IN DEFFERING TO THE TWO MARSHAMAUL REWARD IS AM PREDICTIVE OF OF OTHER THINGS IN LIFE BUT LEAVING THAT ASIDE U AMI CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT THAT TASK IS A FRONTAL LOB TASK THE KIDS ARE GIVEN A NOVEL RULE YOU NAVE ONE MARSHANA A NOW OR WAIT UM PATIENTLY AND THEN A WITH AND OVERCOME THE CRAVING FOR THAT ONE MARSHAMA AN THEN YOU'LL GET TOO UM PRESUMABLY THAT UM THAT EXPERIMENT IS ENGAGING THE FRONTAL LOABES AND YOU KNOW WEE CAN ONLY SPECULATE BUT UM SOME KIDS ARE ABLE TO DEFER SOME OR NOT UM AND I CAN IMAGINE THAT AT THAT AGE THERE'S A LOT OF NEUROPLASTICITY AM STRENGTHENING AND WEAKENING OF CONNECTIONS IS IN THE BRAIN ON IN AN EXPERIENCED DEPENDENT WAY SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT UM CHILDREN AND PERHAPS ADULTS AS WELL CAN TRAIN UP THERE PREFRONTAL CORT CORTICAL ABILITIES TO STRATAGISE AND DEFER ING A WAY THAT'S ADAPTIV ABSOLUTELY I MEAN DEFINILLY YOU CAN LEARN TRAGEE'S TO NOT ONLY SORT OF LEARN RULES UM BUT BUT HOW TO APPLY GOALLS BEN WHEN YOU START TO THINK ABOUT THAT TASK AND PARTICULAR SOME OF IT HAS TO DO WHAT SORT OF MAINTAINING A GOAL AND AND MAINTAINING A GOAL AT DIFFERENT YOU KNOW TIME SCALES RIGHT AND CHILDREN TEND TO E SORT OF ACT ON GOALS THAT ARE MUCH MORE SHORT ON A SHORTER TIME SCALL AN I'M GAN HAVE THE SALONE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY I SUPPOSE TO WAIT IL TILL DINNER WHICH IS A LONGER LONGER TERM GOAL AND SO YE HAVE THIS DEFAULT A SORT OF THE SHORT YOU CAN YOU CAN LEARN THAT MAINTAINING A LONGER TYPE GOAL I IT CAN BE MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL I THEN THEN THE SHORT TERM GULL EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T SEEM OBVIOUS AND WE ALL LEARN THAT RIGHT WAS WE IT AS WE GET ALONGER OF US WE KEEP OR IY ON THE BALL OR MOR LONG TERM GOALS AND THAT'S VERY PREDICTIVE OF OU SUCCESSFUL WE CAN WE CAN BE THE FARTHER OUT WE CAN MAINTAIN AT CALLON THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THE PREFRONT OF CORTEX DOES IT MAINTAINS GOALS AND THAN APPLIES THOSE GOALS AND IF YOU DON'T APPLY IM THEN YOU LOE YOU KNOW THEN THEN ALL OF THIS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION BREAKS DOWN DO YOU THINK THAT THESE ALGARITHMS AND RULES THAT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTICAL CIRCUITRY CAN LEARN AND INDEED DOES LEARN CAN GENERALIZE SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN I  MY FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE WAS THE DISASTER A FOR REASONS THAT AREN'AN INTERESTING RIGHT NOW BUT THEN WHEN I CAME BACK MYSOFFMORE YEAR REALLY SPRING OF MY FRESHRMEN YEARS LIKE OCAY ITS ON IT WAS HAD THE RESCUE MYSELF AND SO ONE OF THINGSTHEY AS TO DO AS I WOULD STUDY UM AND I WOULD SET A TIMER SO I REFUSE TO GET UP EVEN IF I A USE THE THE REST R IN VER VERY VERY BADLY I WOULD I'M SET UP ALL SORTS OF BEHAVIOURAL CONSTRAINTS UM AND I LIKE TO THINK THAT I WAS BUILDING UP MY PREFRONTOLE ABILITY REFOCUS ON THE MATERIAL AND FORTUNATELY FOR ME THERE WERE NO SMART FONES NI THEN   MUCH EASER I INTERNET NOW WE HAD GET OL BUT NO NO NALL INTERNET BROWSING TO TO SPEAK OF AND I LIKE TO THINK THAT THE I SOMETIMES CALL IT A AND THIS IS TERRIBLE BAM TO CALL THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT A NEARLY EXHAUSTIVE OF THE UNDERLING FUNCTION BY CALLT SORT LIKE LIMBIC FRICTION IT'S LIKE THEIRE'S THIS FRICTION THAT ONE FEELS MENTALLY LIKE YOU WANT IT GET UP YOU WHEN HEAS THE REST RME HEN EATS SOMETHING HONE O CALL A FRIEND BUT YOU STAY FOCUST ON THE TASK IN HAND DO YOU THINK THAT THAT BUSINESS OF COTING  STAIN FOCUST ON THE TASK AT HAND CAN GENERALIZE BECAUSE OF THE SENSATIONS IT GENERATES IN THE BODY AND THEN YOU OWE THAT THAT TIS IS FAMILIAR THIS IS JUST LIKE STUDYING BUT IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT YE ONE IS ONE SEAYS FOCUS WORE DO YOU THINK THAT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXES IT'S SO CONTEXT SPECIFIC THAT IT NEEDS TO LEARN A RULE THE RULES FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL SITUATION AND THAN THIS HAS ALL SORTS OF IMPLICATIONS FOR BEHAVIOUR  RESTRAINED AND FOCUS AND ATTENTION DEFIS IT SO A IF YOU COULD JUS SPECULATE UAM A THAT KNOWIN YET WHEN AIST ID IN HOW THEY CAN BE MORE FOCUST AND PEOPLE OFTEN DEFERT YOU LIKE WHAT SUPPLEMENT WHAT DRUG OCET THAT THOSE ARE INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY WERE TALKIN ABOUT NERAL CIRCUITRY YET I MEAN IT ABSOLUTELEY CAN GENERALIZE TIT THAT'S BEEN A FRUSTRING THING AND DE TRYING TO DEVALOP WHAT WE CALL COGNITERAPY WHERE WE WE TEACH WE TRY AND PROVE SOME ONE'S MEMORYABILITY WE TRY AND PROVE SON'S EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONABILITY THAT THE DISAPPOINTING EARLY RESULTS WAS ALWAYS THAT YE THEY GET VERY GOOD AT THE TASK THAT YOU TRAIN THEM AT BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO JERNALIZE THAT ANYTHING OUSE IF YOU TEACH HEM A YOU KNOW A TASK THEY CAN DO AMAZING THINGS LIKE MATCH O FINGER TO COLORS OR SHAPE AND PUT TOGETHER ALL SORTS OF RULES AND THEN AND THE'RE REALLY GOOD AT THAT TASTS VERY QUICKLY AND THEND NOTHINGS REALLY CHANGED IN THER REAL LIFE BUT BUT I THINK WE'VE LEARNED IN HOW A SORT OF AND HOW TO TRYAND MAKE IT A TRANSLATE TO REAL LIFE AND AND SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THERE'S A THERABE CALLED GOL MAN HAD BEEN TRAINING WHICH IS DEVELOPED A BY BRYIN LEVINING COLLEGS AT THE ROTMAN RESEARCHENS TO TORANTA WHERE THEY'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN TEACHING A PATIENCE I DON'T APROVE YOUR EXECUTIVE FUNCTIOND AAND HOW TO MAKE THAT TRANSLATE INTO REAL WORLD BUT IT'S IT'S VERY HARD WORK ITS IT'S VERY THERAPIS DRIVEN IT IT REQUIRES IM IT REQUIRES A SERIES OF O TRAININGS FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE LEARNE A THEY DEVELOP INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS LIKE PLANNING A MEAL OR PLANNING A FAMILY VACATIOND PLANNING UP HOD GASAN THAN THEY WORK THROUGH WHAT'S INVOLVED IN THAT SOR O VERY SPECIFIC PROJECT HOW YOU HOW YOU STAY FOCUS HOW YOU DON'T JUST GET DISTRACTED HOW YOU YOU KEEP YOUR EY IN THE BALL HOW YOU BREAK IT DOWN TO SUBGULLS HOW YOU IM YOU MOT TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING HOW YOU DON'T LET ANXIETING PORASCINATION GAN VALL BUT IT'S A IT'S A VERY ACT OF SOR PROCESS BUT WHEN YOU ADD ALL THAT TO IT AND A VERY DISCIPLINE WAY OVER TE COURSE OF MANY HOURS MANY WEEKS IT DOES TRANSLATE PATIENCE AND INDIVIDUALS TO SAY YE I'M JUST BETTER DOING THINGS I MEAN THE WHOLE GULLS TO DO THINGS TRIET AND AND I'M JUST BETTER AT IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I'M I'M NOT JUST BETTER AT WHAT YOU TAUGHT MA AM JUST BETTERATE AT OTHER THINGS SO I DO HAVE A LOT OF HOPE THAT THESE KIND OF THERAPECE BILL GENERALIZE TO THE RENA TO PEOPLE'S REAL LIFE I THROUGHOUT THE TERM LIMBIC FRICTION AGAIN NOT A TECHNICAL OR CLINICAL OR OFFICIAL TERM IN ANYWAY BUT JUST A WAIY TO AND A CAPTURED UM SOME OF THE INTERACTIONS OF THE FRONT OF QUARTE WITH OTHER CIRCUITRY I'MIN THES FAR MOR UM INVOLVED IN AGITATION AND CHALLENGES FOCUSSING THAN THE LIMBIC SYSTEM BUT ITS IT CERTAINLY IS INVOLVED UM WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE FRONTAF QUARTEX I OFTEN THINK ABOUT IT'S CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAINS WO MAY BE WE COUL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE CONNECTIONS AND AND IN PARTICULAR THE CONNECTIONS FROM THE FRONT AL QUARTEX TO WHAT'S CALL IT AM CIRCUITRY THAT CONTROLS REFLECTIVE BEHAVIORS UM WHAT ARE WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT CIRCUITRY AND UM CAN WE MAKE ANY GENERAL STATEMENTS LIKE DOES THE FRONTAL QUARTEX REALLY SERVE TO UM PROVIDED QUIETING UM SUPPRESSIVE FUNCTION ON REFLECES OR IS IT MORE OF AN ORCUSTOR A CONDUCTOR WHERE IT SAYING LOOKA LITTLE BIT OF THAT LOMAN O THAT UM AND THEN WHAT'S WHAT COMES OUT IN BEHAVIOR OR SPEECH IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS VERY ORGANIZED BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE THE THE REFLECTION OF THE LOT OF SELECTIVE FILTERING YES I MEAN THE PREFENAL QUARTEX WHAT SO FASTENING ABOUT IS THAT IT I WOULD SAY IT CONNECTS THAT EVERY PART OF THE BRAIN A QARTAX AND THE SUB QUARTAX AND ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE BRAIN CONNECTS TO IT O THAT I MEAN THAT RIGHT THERE TELLS YOU IT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANCE ERY AND ID IT HAS TO IF IT'S GOING TO BE IN THIS O YOU KNOW CONDUCTOR TI EXPERIENCE A ROLL AND SO IT'S IN THIS PRIVILEGED POSITION JUST ANATOMICALLY SO THAT THAT CAS AS GREAT INSIDE TO HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND SO IT IS CONNECTING AND THEN OF COURSE WE COUL TALK ABOUT IT HOW IT'S CONNECTED TO THE BODY AS WELL HOW I CONTROL IS HARTRAGT AND RESPIRATIONS AS WELL SO S NOTCHESS THIS THE BRAINS SO A BUT IT'S REALLY INTERESTING LIKE YOU SAID IS IS IT REALLY JUST SORT OF MAINTAINING TELLING YOU WHAT'S RELEVANT AND WHAT'S NOT RELEVANT ORS AN ALLOWING YOU TO SWITCH I THINK IT DOES ALL THOSE THINGS IIT DEFINALLY WHAT WE CALL SENSE THESE TOP DOWN SIGNALS IT'S SENDING SIGNALS TO OTHE BRAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD BE PAYIN ATTENTION TO AN WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE A PPAY AN ATTENTION TO SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WE'VE DONE STUDIES WITH FUNCTIONAL IMAGING WHERE WE HAVE THEM LOOK AT PICTURES OF FACES AND SCENES AND THAT LIGHTS UP THE BACK OF YOUR BRAIN YOUR VISUAL QARTEX AS AREAS AT ER CAN PROCESS FACES AND PROCESS SCENES AND OM BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE YOU JUST ONE PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACES AND NOT THE SCENES AND OTHER TIMES WE WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTIONTO THE SCENES AND NOT THE FACES WELL YOU DON'T EVEN THOUGH IT'S GETTING THE SAME BOTTOM UP VISUAL IN PUT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX WILL SHOW GREATER ACTIVITY TO THE RELEVANT INFORMATION IT  IT'LL IT'LL SOR IT'S SENDING A SIGNAL SAY PAY ATTENTION THE FACES IT IGNORE THE SCENES AND A OR VICE AVERSA SO IT'S IT'S DIRECTING ALL OF THIS INFORMATION TAT EWARTED WITH TO WHAT'S WHAT'S RELEVANT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ALSO A SALLOWING US TO SWITCH IF IF THAT WE NOW HAVE TO GO SWITCH TO ANOTHER TASK ITS SAS OF CA THIS AS NOT IN PORTANT NOW ORE GANG TO MOVE OVER TO THIS THIS OTHER OTHER TASK SO THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF HOW I CAN YOU KNOW HOW I CAN KIND OF CONTROL BEHAVOUR BUT IT DOES ALL OF THESE THINGS IN THIS INCREDIBLE WAY THAT WE TIOD DONT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE KNOW THAT'S THE SOURCE OF OF ALL F THIS CONTROL IS COMING FROM THE PREFROM THE QARTEX I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT AND THINK ONE OF OUR SPONSERS AND THAT'S AG ONE AG ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT ALSO CONTAINS ADOPTIGONS I STARTY TAKING AG ONE AWAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THE REASON I STARTY TAKING IT N THE REASON I STILL TAKE IT EVERY DAY IS THAT IT INSURES THAT I MEEN ALL OF MY QUOTAS FOR VITEMENS AND MINERALS AND IT INSURES THAT I GET ENOUGH PREBOTIC AND PROBIOTIC TO SUPPORT GOT HEALTH NOW GOD HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WE REALIZED IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR GOT BUT ALSO FOR OUR MUNE SYSTEM AND FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NAUROW TRANSMITTERS AND AUROMODULATORS HINGS LIKE DOPAMING IN SER ATONENT IN OTHER WORDS GOD HEALTH IS CRITICAL FOR PROPER BRAIN FUNCTIONING NOW OF COURSE I STRIVE TO CONSUME HEALTHY WHOLE FOODS FOR THE MAJORITY OF MYNUTRITIONAL WENTAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS IN AG ONE INCLUDING SPECIFIC MICRO NETRANS THAT ARE HARD TO GET FROM WHOLE FOODS ORE AT LEAST IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES SO AG ONE ALLOWS ME TO GET THE VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT I NEED PROBIOTIC PREBOATICS THE ADAPTIGENS AND CRITICAL MICRORNUTRIENCS SO ANY TIME SOMEBODY ASKS ME IF THEY WERE TO TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT THAT SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE I TELL THEM AG ONE BECAUSE AG ONE SUPPORT SO MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BODY THAT ARE INVOLVED IN MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE TO TRY AG ONE GO TO DRINK G ONE DOTCAM SLASH HUMERMAN AND YOU'LL GET A YOUR SUPPLY A VITEMAN D THREE K TWO AND FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS OF AG ONE AGAIN THAT'S A DRINK AG ONE DOCALM SLASH HUBERMENT YOU MENTION CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE PREFRONTAL QARTEX IN THE BODY U THAT'S THE FIRST I'VE HEARD OF THAT UM AND I'M NOT CHALLENGING THAT ATO THE CONTRARY I'M JUST INTRIGUED BY IT M I'M AWARE THAT THE HI POFALMESS AND SOME THESE DEEPER BRAINE STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH MORE UM WHAT'S CALL THE PRIMITIVE DRIVES UM TEMPERATURE REGULATION A HUNGER ET CETERA CONNECT TO THE BODY BUT A WHATR WHAT'S THE NATURE OF SOME OF THE CONNECTIONS WITH THE FARULS TO THE  O YAS JUST OR TALKING TERMS OF OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW YOUNG CHANGING I I WANTED YOUR PATES TO TALK ABOU TI AS TO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXS AND SLOW HEARTWRIGHTS I MEANT IN THAT IN THAT ROTWAY GOT IT AT THAT THAT YET BI BI THA BY INFLUENCE AND A CORTICAL FUNCTION WILL OBVIOUSLY WE CAN INFLUENCE A A ORGANS LIKE THE GOT IT SO THROUGH SOME INTERMEDIATE STATIONS YES YE I MEA IT'S YOU KNOW NOT TO UM NOT TO BE HYPEROBOLIC BUT  SEEMS LIKE THE FREEFRONTAL QUARTEX WHAT HERE ERE REFERRING TO AS THE FRONTA LOAVES UM ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SEAT OF WHAT MAKES US HUMAN AND WHAT MAKES US FUNCTIONAL OR DISFUNCTIONAL IN A GIVEN CONTEXT IT I M AH I RECALL THERE'S A CYNDRUM CLUVERBUCY CYNDRUM WHICH HAS SOME VAGUE UM A SIMILARITIES TO HOW YOU DESCRIBE FRONTAL CART TAMAGE BUT THERE I AS I RE CALL HUMANS OR ANIMALS UM WITH THAT CYNDRUM WILL ACT IN A WAY THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO CONTEXT BUT MORE INAPPROPRIATE LIKE THELL THEY'LL TRY AND EAT A A SURAMAC COP OR DRAW WITH A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH OBVIOUSLY WON'T WORK IT SEEMS LIKE WITH THE FRONTAL QUARTEX IT KNOWS THAT A PEN IS FOR WRITING IT JUST THE PERSON MIGHT SAY I KNOW NOT SPECA WRITE THIS BUT I'M JUST IN OR WRITE WITH IT BUT I WHEN O TAKE YOUR PEN AND WRITE SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE WITH IT BUT IT'S NOT THAT THE THE PEOPLE FORGET THAT THERE'S THAT IT'S A PEN SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S DRAWING ON UM SO RULE SETS BUT THAT SOMETHINGS INTACT IT'S LIKE THAT IT'S NOT LIKE CLUVER BUCY SYNDRUM WERE UM LIKE ANIMAL SOME PEOPLE CAN TRYIN A LIKE MATE WITH INANAMIT ARE OBJEX U WHICH IS ONE OF THE MORE SALIEN UM SOMETIMES I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT GERUM FROM MY COGN NURS IENCE COURSE WHICH YO Y THE WAY UM TO THROW THAT IN THERE SO YE  SI HHOW SHAL WE THING ABOUT THIS AND HEREMCHIN AN GET AT A KIND OF A BROADER UNDERSTANDING A BRAIN FUNCTION AND CONTEX SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR UM IT SO FRONTA QUARTEX IS LIKE SUPERSIPISTIC ATED UM BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION  SEEMS LIKE SOME ONE WITHOUT A FRONT OR QUARTECTS PROBABLY KNOWS THAT YOU WRITE WITH A PEN YOU DON'T WRITE WITH A PIECE OF PAPER YE I I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT IT AS IT'S YOU KNOW THE FRONTOCORT AS ALLOWS US TO TAKE THOUGHT AND MOVE IT TOWARDS ACTION AND THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE THE KNOWLEDGE AND AN ACTION AND THIS SEPARATION OF ACTION FROM KNOWLEDGE AND I GESS I CAN REFLECT ON MY PATIENCE YOU KNOW WHEN I I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PATIENCE WITH DAMAGE ALL OVER THE BRAIN AND ALL THE FAMILIES OF PATIENCE WHO HAVE FRONTA OF INJURY ALWAYS SAY THE SAME THING THER THEY'RE JUST NO LONGER THAT PERSON THEY'RE NO LONGER MY SPAUSE ARE NO LONGER MY BEST FRIEND AND NO LONGER MY FATHER TOS SOMETHING THEY CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS BUT THEY'RE NOT THEM ANY MORE THERE'S SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WHEREAS IF YOU TALKED OF PATIEN WITH BROKAS OF PHASIA WHOSE HAS THIS INABILITY TO SPEAK THEY CAN'T GET ANY WORDS OUT NOW THIS IS A DEVASTATING PROBLEM THERE' STILL THE SAME PERSON THEY THEY THEY THEIR PERSONALITY HASN'N CHANGE THEY THEY FEEL THE SAME PERSON THEY JUST CAN'T SPEAK THE WAY THEY GET AROUND IN THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT OR IF YOU TAKE A PATIENT WITH PROSEPIC KNOWS IT WHICH IS A THIS INABILITY TO RECOGNIZE FACES OF COURSE THE WAY THEY NAVIGATE AROUND THE WORLD IS IS IS DIFFICULT AND IT'S NOT THE SAME BUT THERE'S STILL THE SAME PERSON SO THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT THE FRONTAL CARTAX THAT ALLOWS US TO BE AS YOU SAID SIR OF WHO WE ARE AND THAT'S THE DIFFICULT PART LIKE HOW DOES THE FRONTELOPES ALLOW US OR TAKE A TAKE WHO WE ARE INTRANSLATE THAT INTO NOLED SO WE'RE NOT I GUESS ANOTHER WORSE SAYING IT JUST JUST HAVING KNOWLEDGE IS IN WHAT MAKES US WHO WE ARE RIGHT AT THIS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT KNOWLEDGE AND AND AND PRESENTED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO LIVE LIFE BASES ON OUR INTENTIONS AND OUR GOALS AND OUR DESIRES SO MUCH OF THINGS LIKE STOIC PHILOSOPHY AND UM AND EVEN ONLYING WELL MISS CULTURE ARE BOUT UM HAVING ROUTINES UM YOU O OVERCOMING REFLECTS BY JUST HAVING RECIPES SCRIPS TO FOLLOW EACH DAY UM I CERTAINLY TRY TO HAVE MY MOURNINGS BE AS WHAT I CALL LINER AS POSSIBLE AND I FIND IT'S MUCH EASIER IN THE EARLIER PART OF THE DAY TO JUST DECIDE HEARS WHAT IM TO DO WRIHT OUT O LIS DO THINGS IN A CERTAIN SEQUINCE IF I DON'T DO THAT I GO NON LINEER AS I REFER TO IT  WELL GET DISTRACTED AND THINGS THAT SORT BUT UM EARLIER YOU MENTION SLEEP DEPROVATION CAN IMPAIR FRONT A LOW FUNCTION IT DOES SEEM THAT UM AS THE DAYE PROGRESSES AND CERTAINLY IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT IT JUS BECOMES MUCH HARDER TO UM CONTROL ARE ARE THINKING MAYBE EVEN OUR BEHAVIOR BUT UM AND CERTAINLY OUR EMOTIONS IS THERE A FRONTA LOD A REGULATION OF EMOTIONAL STATES AS WELL I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME RECENT WORK ON THIS  LOVEDIE  YE I MEAN AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER THE FRONTALOVES AS A BIG PLACE AND AND HALF OF IT IS INVOWED AN THESE HIGH LEVEL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS BUT THE OTHER HALF OF IT IS IN IS A PART UP THE LYMIC SYSTEM OR THAT WE CALL THE PARELEMIC ISSEM THAT'S INVOLVED AN SOCIONAL AND EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR AND SO A THERE'S THIS INTIMATE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THESE TWO AREAS OF THE QARTEXS IF YOU HAVE JUST DAMAGE TO THESE FRONTUL TO THESE AREAS THAT ARE CONDN IN THE FRONTA LOBE YOU WILL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT IN PARMENTS THAT ARE WE WOULD CALL SIR SOCIAL OR EMOTIONAL APPARENTS AND THEIR EXECUTIVE FUNCTION WILL BE QUITE NORMAL AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE THE THE OPPOSITE WHERE PATIENTS WITH THE LATLE DAMAGEAL HAVE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS BUT THEY SEEM EMOTIONALLY ANTACT BUT BUT YOU KDON'T IN YOUREAL LIFE WHEN WE HAVE BOTH THESE ANTACT THEIR THEIR COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER SO RIHT EMOTION IN CONTACTS AND IS GOINGTO INFLUENCE ARE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION WE MAKE BAD DECISIONS IN STRESTSFUL SITUATIONS ARE SISTUATIONS WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH ITS IT'S WHERE WE MIGHT MAKE A BETTER DECISION IF IT'S A QUIET YOW KIND O COME QUIET PLACE U BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN I THINK YOURE RIGHT YOU CAN YOU CAN SORT OF GET INTO ROUTINE AND LEARN HOW TO DO THINGS YOU KNOW IF YOU  HAVE VERY MUCH PLAN TOAW BUT WHATS SO UNIQUE ABOUT US OU WE CAN BE FLEXIBLE ON A DATHABLL RIGHT WHEN WHEN SOMETHING NOVEL COMES OPER THERE'S SOMETHING I SOMETHING UNEXPECTED COMES UP WE CAN ADAPT TO IT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE FRONT OF CORTEX IS REALLY IMPORTANIMPOR IM NOT JUST SORT OF MAKING THESE PLANS ROUTINES AND SENTING ALL THE RULES WITH BEING ABU WHEN THINGS DON'T GO RIGHT HA TA HOW TO WRITE THE SHAP RIGHT I WILL NEVER ASK YOU TO UM DEMONIZE TECHNOLOGY UM I CERTAINLY USE A A SMARTPHONE UM FROM WAKING TILL SLEEP UM GENERALLY NOT IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT IF I CAN AVOID IT A AND I GENERALLY AVOID IT BUT AM TRYING TO TAKE WHAT WE'V DISCUSSED THIS FAR AND SUPERIMPOSE THE THE NOTION OF SMART PHONES AND ASK WHAT ARE THE RULES WHAT ARE THE ALGARITMS THAT WERE LEARNING WHEN WE USE THESE DEVICES AND I'M NOT CALLING THEM ADAPT IVE WORE MALEDAPT IF THE'RE CLEARLY HERE TO STAY THEY'VE ASSISTED IN MEDICINE I'M SURE IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR DOCTORS TO COMMUNICATE ON THE ON THE WARD AN AND FOR UM CLINIC AND AR IT BUT SO USEFUL IT BUT CONTAINED IN THE SMALL DEVICE UM THERE ARE THINGS LIKE U FOR INSTANCE TEXT MESSAGING WHERE UNLIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO WE CAN HAVE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS VERY QUICKLY WHILE BOARDING A FLIGHT UM THERE'S A TASKS WHICHING ELEMENT THAT WAS JUST NOT PRESENT IN AR LIFE UM PRIOR TO THAT UM SOCIAL MEDIUM PARTICULAR THIS NOTION OF BEING ABLE TO SCROLL SO MOVE IF WE REALLY STEP BACK FROM THIS MOVE ONE'S THUMB AN ACCESS HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF VIDIO CONTENT FROM DISWHICH EACH OF WHICH HAS A DISTINCT CONTEXT UM AND SO HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT KIDS INDADULTS HAVE FRONTAL CORTESIES THAT A LEARNING THESE RULES AND THE RULE IS MOVE YOUR THUMBS STAY ENGAGED EMOTIONS EITHER POSITIVE AILENCE EMOTIONS OR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND ME IT'S IT'S A FAIRLY LIMITED UM LANDSCAPE THERE WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT BUT BUT THE ALGARITHM THAT'S LEARNED IS TO ME DOESN'T SEEM EXPLORTABLE IT DOESN'T HELP ME PREPARE FOR A PODCAST AT ALL I KNOW THAT FOR SHORT DOESN'T HELP ME GO FOR A RUN DOESN'T HELP ME LISTEN WITH MORE FOCUSED ATTENTION TO A FAMILY MEMBER WERE A FRIEND OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER UM IT MAY MAKE ME MORE IMPATHICH OR MORE ANGRY I YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN SPECULATE BUT UM AGAIN WITH NO WITH NO INTENTION OF DEMONIZING SOCIAL MEDIA IT DOES IT SEEM THAT THAT THE ALGARITHMS THAT ARE BEING RUN IN OUR BRAIN MEN ARE THEY NEUTRAL RE THEY POSITIVE ARE THEY NEGATIVE SHOALL WE BE WORRIED UM IT DOESN'T SEEM LAKE THEY TRANSLATE TO MUCH ELSE THEY WHI CAN'T SEE A WAY IN WHICH THEY HELP US BE BETTER PEOPLE IN OTHER DOMAINS WHERE AS READING A BOOK LINE BY LINE AND THEN GOING BACK O I DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER ANYTHING FROM THAT PAGE GOING BACK LINE BY LINE UM PLING I GAME A SQUASH OR SOMETHINGLIKE THAT THERE I CAN SEE THE REAL VALUE OF THE RULE SETS THAT GENERALIZE YE I MAND I CAN YOU KNOW JUST HISTORICALLY I CORRUPT IN WORLD WHEN THERE WAS NO SMARPHONES AS A RESIDENC AND AND SO ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS I DO IN PRACTICES HAVE TO TAKE CARE PATIENCE IN EMERGENCY ROOM AND THERE'S A REAL EMERGENCY SO ONE'S HAVING COND CONTROL SEISARS OR THERE HAVING A STROKE AND YOU KNOW DOING THIS BACK IN THE AIDIES OR NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSAND WHEN YOU WENT DOWN THERE AND YOU DIDN'T HAV ANY SMART PHONE YOU YOU CULD ONLY RELY ON WHAT'S WHAT'S IN YOUR HEADE AND I COUL SAY NOW HAVING THE SMART PHONE IT HASN'T IT DOESN'T HELP ME AT ALL I I NEVER U KNOW DOES NOT HELP ME AT ALL IN MAKING THE KIND OF DECISIONS THAT I HAVE TO MAKE IN EMERGEURE I'M I'M TRYING TO SIDE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS WHAT HOW SHOULD I TREATED I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE VERY GOING THROUGH AN ALGROWN LIKE YOU SAID IN A COMMON SENSE WAYAND THERE'S NOTHING ON MY PHONE THAT I CAN TURN TO TO HELP ME DO THAT IT HAS HELPED WITH GIVING ME KNOWLEDGE  LIKE BACK IN THE DAY I TO REMEMBER WHAT THE DI LAND AN DOSE WAS AND HAVE THAT IN MY HEAD OR GO LOOK FOR THE PIECE OF PAPER MY POCKET AND SO I CAN QUICKLY PULL UP YOU KNWI GIF I'M A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW THERE'S INFORMATION THAT I CAN ACCESS I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT KEEPING EVERY SINGLE DOSE IN MY HEAD OR KEEPING EVERYTHING MY HEAD JUST FACTS IN MY HEAD BUT AOUTSIDE OF THAT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN TURN TO THAT IT'S IT'S MAKING ME YOU KNOW BETTER MAKING ME MAKE BETTER DECISIONS S I I DON'T EVEN NEED MYSELF PHONE I DON'T GO SEARCHING U FOR MYSELF PONE IF I'M GOING TO GO TO MERIS O REMORIGAN TO TAKE A TAKE A PHONCL SO I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S HELPING SOR MAKE YOUR FRONT TH LOK IT CAN'T BE YOUR FRONT TO LOVES I MEAN THIS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING IT BUT BUT ION THE FLIPSIDE CAN IT HELP YOU OPTOMIZE FRONT TO LOVE FUNCTION  TECHNOLOGIES CERTAINLY IT CAN WE CAN MAYBE TALK ABOUT LATER THERE ARE DISCERTAINLY THIT THAT'S ONE WAY TO GET LEARNED STRATEGISUS THROUGH A THROUGH A DEVICE THAT THAT'S EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND YOU KOW TO YOU AS SUPPOSA BOOK OR OR I ING A THERAPIST THE IN YOUR HOUSE I SUPPOSE I WORRY THAT AM TOO MUCH OF MY TIME AND OTHER PEOPLE'S TIME AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE'S TIME IS AM ENGAGING IN A ALGARITHM THAT DOES NOT UM GENERALIZE FOR ADAPTIV BEHAVIOUR ELSEWHERE AND AND BY COMPARISON YOUKNOW LIKE A THE GAME O SALKER WITH FRIENDS OR SOMETHING I IT'S SOCIAL SOCIAL MEDIA SOCIAL AM IT'S PHYSICAL SOCIL MEDYAIS NOT PHYSICAL BUT WILL WILL RULE THAT THAT PORTION OUT BUT THERE'S A RULE SET UM ERE'S GOLL DIRECTED BEHAVIOUR AM PRESUMABLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN A GAME A SALKER WITH FRIENDS TRANSLATE TO SOME OTHER DOMAIN OF LIFE AM BECAUSE IT'S A SINGLE CONTEXT GAME OF SALKER WHERES THA SOCIAL MEDIA I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT GOES AND LOOKS AT ONE ACCOUNT AND THAT'S IT AND ABSORBS THE INFORMATIOND MAY BE COMMENTS HAS AN INTERACTION AND GOES IT'S IT'S HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF CONTEXT SO IS THERE ANY RISK OR PERHAPS BENEFIT TO BEING ABLE TO AM GET THIS VERY A DETAILED PORTAL INTO SO MANY CONTEXTS PREUNIT TIME ND THAT THE FORBINGS NEVER HAD DONE THAT IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY AS FAR AS I KNOW YE I MAY I THINK THERE IS A RISK BUT WAT POPS TO MINE N YOUR HAVING KIDS IS IS WATCHING THEM NAVIGATE IN THEIR CARS TO PLACE IS TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ANGOGAL MAPS AND I THI YOU'RE PRY OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER REAL MAPS  THAT WERE YOU DOES ASOAELEMAPS I WERE YOU HAD TO REALLY FIGURE HAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAD TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE AND YOU HAD THEITHER LOOK AT THE MAP OR OR OR AS SOPIT AGASAYS ON AST OF THES THIS THESE SKILLS WERE SOMETHING THAT YOU LEARNED AND YOU DEVELOPED AND IT WAS PROBLEM SOLVING AND AND A AND THAT'S ALL GONE NOW I MEAN THAT IT'S IT'S I I WONDER EVEN IF SOMETIMES IF IF A PEOPLE EVEN KNOW THE DIRECTION THERE GOING WHETHER IT'S WAS NORTHOR WHAT SET DOWN THER END BECAUSE THERE JUST FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION SO I WE'LL SEE I I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THAT LEARNED SKILL AS NOCK AND O BE DETRIMENTAL TO US AT IT'S SOME POINT IN GENERALIZEIN THE PEVERSE GENERALIZE AN A BAD WAY RIGHT AND AS AS SOPPOSED TO A GOOD WAY AM SO I DON'T YA IT DOES IT DOES DEPTFUALLY WORRY ME BUT LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S NOTHING ON THE PHONE THAT HELPS YOU PLAN A POT GAST NOMETHING THAT HELPS ME IN THE EMERGED ROM NOTHING ELPSE A PROFESSOR HEN HE'S GIVING A LECTURE SO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SORT OF HAVING YOUR HEAD BURIED IN IN A SELPHONE I'M NOT YET IIT'S I DON'T SEE THO BEING HEALTHY FOR YOUR FRONT OLOVES LET'S TALK ABOUT WORKING MEMORY AM SOE YEARS BACK BUT STILL NOW YOU USE WORKING MEMORY TASKS IN EXPERIMENTS IN YOUR LABORATORY FEW WOULD AM BE SO KIND AS TO EXPLAIN WHAT WORKING MEMORY IS AND THEN I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT UM SOME OF THE WORK YOU'VE DONE EXPLORING THE RULE OF DOPE OF MEN IN WORKING MEMORY AM BECAUSE THIS IS SO CRITICAL TO EVERY DAY LIFE AND I KNO DOPEMEINS TO BIT OF A BUZZ WORD THESE DAYS BUT I'M THE LISTENERS TOF THIS PODCAST ANYWAY OR AR UM PRETTY SOPHISTICATED IN TERMS OF KNOWING THAT DOPAMING IS NOT JUST ABOUT REWARD IT'S ABOUT MOTIVATION AND GOLD DIRECTED BEHAVIOR AND I THINK DOPAMNG INTRIGUES FOR A GOOD REASON THAT IT DOES GOVERN A LOT OF OUR YOU KNOW QUALITY OF LIFE TO IM WHAT'S WORKING MEMORY YET I MEAN WORKING MEMORY IT SINCRTING A START STUDYING IT ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO AND I DON'T THINK I REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS WHEN I STARTED BUT WHAT WE MEAN BY WORKING MEMORYES IS ABILITY TO HOLD INFORMATION IN MIND I WHEN IT'S NO LONGER ACCESSIBLE TO US SO IF YOU TELL ME YOU'RE TELEPHONE NUMBER AND I'M AFTER PUT IT INTO MY PHONE YOU KOW IT'S NO LONGER THERE YOU JUST TOLD ME BUT I'LL HOLD IT IN MIN WORKING MEMORY UNTIL I CAN PUNCH IT INTO MY MY PHONE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM TH OUTSIDE WORLD I COULD HOLD UP A YOU KNOWI I CAN PULL UP MY OWN IF I'M FILLING OUT O FORM AND I WANT TO PULL UP MY SULF SECURITY NUMBER I CAN HOLD THAT IN MIND TO UNTIL I PUT IT DOWN SO I'M WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TUS YOU KNOW ABILITY THAT WE HAVE THAT WE DO VERY FOLLOUSLY AND WHAT I'VE LEARND MORE ABOUT WORKING MEMORY IS IS THE WORKING PART OF IT T IT'S NOT JUST AS PASSIVE HOLDING INFORMATION OF MINE WHUT IT'S BEING ABLE TO DO THINGS WITH THE INFORMATION IT'S BEING ABLE TO IM YOU KNOW IT WHEN WE WHEN WE DO A BATH PROBLEM WHICH WE DON'T DO THAT MUCH NOW THAT WE HAVE CALCULATED IF YOU DO THAT IN YOU'RE HEAD YOU'RE ABLE TO SOR MANIPULATE THE INFORMATION AN AND DO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PROBLEM OR EVEN IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE IN A CROWD AND YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO SOME FACE YOU'RE ABLE TO HOLD THAT FASE IN MIND AND CROSS CHECK IT AND SEARCH AND AND SO THERE'S THERE'S OPERATIONS TO WORKING MEMORY IS NOT JUST OU KNOWS NOT JUST THIS PASSIVE MAINTENANCE SO WHEN WE START TO THINK ABOUT WORKING MEMORY IN THAT WAY WE START TO REALIZE HOW IMPORTIT IS FOR IT'S OU NOT THINK OFIT AS THE FOUNDATION FOR FOR COGNITION IT JUST THINK ABOUT READING COMPREHENSION YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS CONVERSATION IF YOU CAN'T HOLD IN MIND WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW EARLIER IN IN THE CONVERSATION OR WHEN YOURE READING A BOOK YOU REMEMORYING THE SENTENCE I BEFOR IT SO IT IT JUST PREDICTS ALL THESE ABILITIES THAT THAT ALLOWS US TO TO READ TO TO A PLAN TO ORGANIZE IN ALL THE SORT OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS THAT WERE WE'RE DOING RIGHT WE HAVE TO HOLD IN MINE RULES WE HAVE TO HOLD IN MINE GOALS WE HAVE TO HOLD IN MIND ALL OF THESE THINGS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT BEHAVIOR IM YOU KNOW SUS IS IT'S IT'S REALLY COME A LONG WAY AND AND TERMS ABOUT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT IT I I KNOW THAT A MO WALKER SAID THAT LIKE OU NOW SLEEP IS OUR SUPERPOWER BUT I GUESS ONE WAY TO SOR OF USE HIS TERM WHILE WE'RE AWAKE WORKING MEMORY IS IS REALLY OUR SUPERPOWER WES I IT ALLOWS US TO TO TRANSLATE AS WE SAID SIR OF OUR KNOWLEDGE INTO ACTION BY HOLDING THIS INFORMATION A AND MIND AS WERE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IF WE'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT DOPAMING IN THE CONTECTS OF WORKING MEMORY IS DOPAMING AN ACCELERATOR ON WORKING MEMORY IS IT A FACILITATOR WHAT IS DOPAMIN DOING FOR W ORKING MEMORY AND MAY WE COUN TALK A LOBIT ABOUT THE CIRCUITRY A I'VE TALKED ABYUT DOPEN MEN BEFORE ON THIS PODGAST BUT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT SOME OFTHE PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS HAVENT HEARD THOSE EPISODES SO MAY WE COULD JUST QUICKLY REVIEW THE THREE MAJORS CIRCUITS FOR DOPEMING IN THE ONE THIT'S RELEVANT FOR WORKING MEMORY YE BET LET ME STAR WIT THE WORKING MEMORY THE CIRCUITRY FOR WORKING MEMORY BECAUSE WHAN'T WONT OF IT IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT WORKING MEMORY IS THE OTHER TYPE OF MEMORY IS AS LONG TOR MEMORYIES IS YOU YOU CAN WORKING MEMORY SHORT LIVED IT'S ONLY AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO REHEARSE IT AND THEN IT DISAPPEARS WHEREIS WHAT WE CALL LUNG TOR MEMORY IF I IT YOU REMEMBERING WHAT YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST OR YOU'R VACATION THIS IS INFORMATION THAT'S TS CONSOLIDATED AND AND GETS PUT INTO A A MORE DURABLE FORM THAT WE CALL LONG TO MEMORY AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT MEMORY IS THAT THESE ARE SEPARATE SYSTEMS EVERYTHING FROM WORKING MEMORY JUST AS IN PASS INTO LONG TO MEMORY THERE THEYRE TO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND AND TOO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT SEEM TO CONTROL IT A SO WORKING MEMORY A THE FRONT OF CORTEC SEEMS TO BE VERY IMPORTANTD FOR WORKING MEMORY WHEN WHEN WE ARE HOLDING INFORMATION AND LINE THE NURONS THE BRAIN SELLS IN THE FRONTOLOVES ORE ACTIVE AND THEY STAY KIND OF ACTIVE AS LONG AS WE'RE HOLDING ON THAT INFORMATION AND THEY'RE MORE ACTIVE WHEN THE INFORMATION IS RELEVANT A AND IF WE A WE WE GET DISTRACTED DEY'LL GET LESS ACTIVE SO KIND OF THE FRONTA LOPS KON ATRACT YOUR A YOU NOTRACT THE MEMORY THAT YOU'RE  TOLDING IN MIND ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE CIRCUITRY IS THAT I IF WORE HOLDING IN MINE SAY DIDGITS TENSE THE PHONE NUMBER WELL THAT INFORMATIONS IN YOUR BACK OF THE BRAIN AND SO THE THE FRONTA LOES IS SOR KEEPING INFORMATION IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN ACTIVE BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTED TO THE VISUAL AREAS IT'S IT'S ABLE TO SUR KEEP THAT INFORMATION ACTIVE AND SO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THERE'S NOT THESE BUFFERS IN THE BRAIN WHEREYOU KNOW IF YOURE HOLDING FERBAL INFORMATION ITS IN THIS LITTLE BUFFERIN IF YOURE HOLDING VISUAL INFORMATIONS IN ANOTHER BUFFER THE WHOLE BRAIN ACTS AS A BUFFER AND AND THE FRONTA LOVE CAN CALL UP ANY PART OF THE BRAIN AND AND KEEP THAT PART OF THE BRAIN ACTIVE AS IT'S AS IT'S OPYOU KNOW AS IT'S TRYING TO HOLD THIS INFORMATION IN LINE SO THE MECHANISM FOR WORKING MEMORYES JUST THIS PERSISTENT NERAL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE FRONTO LOVES AND SO THEN THE QUESTIONIS WHAT IS DON'T MEAN DO WELL DON'T MEAN IS ONE OF THE NORMODULATORS THAT ARE MADE IN THE BRAINSTEM AND IT PROJECTS UP THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN THERE'S A SYSTEM THAT GOES UP INTO THE INTO THE WHAT WE CALL THE BASILE GANGLA WHICH IS BORN FOR MOTOR FUNCTION AND THITE'S ANOTHER DOPEN REISTAN THAT GOES UP TO THE FRONTOLOVES AND WHAT WAS DISCOVERED WAS THAT IF YOU DEPLETE DON'T MEAN A WORKING MEMORY DROPS YOU GET OF SIGNIFICANT INPAIRMEN WORKING MEMORY IF YIF YOU DOPLET DON'T MEAN AND IF YOU REPLACE IT AH THAN YOUR WORKING MEMORY WILL BE INPROVED AND SO DON'T MEANS SEEMS TO BE A MODULATOR TO HELP THIS PERSISTENT ACTIVITY STATE PERSISTENT A YOU KNOW UDURING THE TIME THAT YOU NEED TO KE THIS INFORMATION IN MIND IN MY REACHING TOO FAR TO DRAWN ANALOGY BETWEEN DOPE MEANS ROLL IN WORKING MEMORY THAT IS TO KEEP INFORMATION ON LINE AND THE OTHER ESTABLISHED ROLL OF DOPAMIN WHICH IS FOR MOVEMENT FOR THE GENERATION OF SMOOTH MOVEMENT IM AS EVIDENCE BY  CONDITIONS LIKE PARKINSONS WHERE PEOPLE LACKDOPAMANURGIN NER ONS OR HAVE DAMAGE O DO'T BENMENURGING NURONS AND HAVE I YOU KNOW CHALLENGES IN GENERATING SMOOTH MOVEMENT WHAT I'M ESSENTIALLY ASKING IS CAN WE THINK OF DOPAMIN AS FACILITATING PHYSICAL MOVEMENT THROUGH ONE CIRCUIT BUT ALSO AND OF MENTAL MOVEMENT THOUGHT MOVEMENT AND A I THINK O  FOR THOSE I JUST LISTENING IN AND NOT WATCHING IM CANO RUBBING MY INDEX IN MINTALE FINGER AGAINST MY THUMB SA JUST KEEPING SOMETHING ON LINE IM IT SORT OF MOVEMENT OF THOUGHT OR INFORMATION AND THEN YOU HAN CHUCK IT AWAY AND BRING IM OUT THE NEXT INFORMATION IS THAT IS THAT I THINK I'S HA GOOD WAY OF THINKING ABOUT AND ONE MY WONDER LOL WILL HOW CAN DON'T MEAN BE IMPORTANT FOR MEMORY BUT ALSO BE IMPORTANT FOR MOVEMENT AND ITS REALLY SIMPLE AS JUST THAT ITS ACTING AT DIFFERENT CIRCUITS THE THE THE NURANS THAT GO TO THE MOTOR AREAS THAT CARRY DON'T MEAN WILL WILL WHEN DON'T MEAN IS EXPRESS THERE THAN AND BOOSTED THERE THEN ITILL BE INVOVED IN MOVEMENT AND LACK OF DON'T MEAN THE BASLE GANGILL LEA TO NER LOG OFAL SORTERS LIKE PARKANSIISEASE THAT HAS SEVERE MOVEMENT A DIFFICULTY BUT WHEN IT'S ACTING IN THE FRONTAL CORTEX AH AND EXPRESS THE FRONTAOL CORTEX THAN IT'S AN IN PROVE WORKING MEMRY SOC IS JUST THA THE NATURE OF WHERE THE CIRCUITS ARE WHERE THE DON'T MEAN IS THAT'S THAT'S ALLOWING IT TO HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIONS AND THAT'S OUGHT FOR ALL TRANSMITTERS A THE REASON WHY OCILE COLING SEEMS TO BE MORE IMPORTANT FOR LONGTER MEMORIES BECAUSE IT IT'S PROJECTING TO THE HIPICAPUS WHICH WAS SO HE KNOWS ANOTHER ARY THAT'S IN FORMED FOR MEMORY AND AND THAT'S WHY ASL COLING DOESN'T BOOSTR WORKING MEMORY BUT DON'T MEAN DOES AN VICIVERSA I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BRAKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS ZERO SUGAR AND THE APPROPRIATE RATIOS OF THE ELECTROLIKE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PATASSIUM AND THAT CORRECT RATIO OF ELECTROLIHTES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY BUT ESPECIALLY YOUR NERVE CELLS YOUR NURONS RELIES ON ELECTROLIHTES IN ORDER O FUNCTION PROPERLY SO WHEN YOUR WELL HYDRATED AND YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF ELECTROLITES IN YOUR SYSTEM YOUR MENTAL FUNCTIONING AND YOUR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IS IMPROVED I DRINK ONE PACKET OF ELEMENT DISSOLVED IN ABOUT SIXTEEN TO THIRTY TWO OUNCES OF WATER WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AS WELL AS WHILE I EXERCISE AND IF I'VE SWEAT ELOCTURING THAT EXERCISE I OFTEN WILL DRINK A THIRD ELEMENT PACKET DISSOLVED IN ABOUT THIRTY TWO OUNCES OF WATER AFTER I EXERCISE ELEMENT COMES IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FLAVORS ALL OF WHICH I FIND REALLY TASTY  LIKE THE CITRISTS I LIKE THE WATER MELLINI LIKE THE RASPBERRY FRANKLY I CAM'T PICK JUST ONE IT ALSO COMES IN CHOCOLATE AND CHOCOLATE MENT WHICH I FIND TASTE BEST IF THEY ARE PUT INTO WATER DISSOLVED AND THEN HEEDID UP I TEND TO DO THAT IN THE WINTER MONTHS BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU DON'T JUST NEED HIDRATION ON HOT DAYS AND IN THE SUMMER IN SPRING MONTHS BUT ALSO IN THE WINTER WHEN THE TEMPERATURES ARE COLD AND THE ENVIRONMENT TENDS TO BE DRY IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENTS SPELLED ELEMENTI DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO TRY A FREE SAMPLE BACK AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN SO DRILLING A LITTLE BIT MORE DEEPLY IN TO THE ROLL OF DOPAMIN AND WORKING MEMORY  YOU DID SOME REALLY LOVELY EXPERIMENTS A SHOWING THAT IF AM PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMN A INCREASE THEIR DOPAMINE A PHORMOCHOLOGICALLY I THINK THE DRUG THAT WAS USE WASS BROMOCRIPTINE A THAT WORKING MEMORY IMPROVES UM CONVERSELY IF ONE TO PLEAS SDOPAMIN PHARMOCOLOGICALLY DOA WORKING MEMORY GETS WORSE AM BUT AS I RECALL THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT BASE LINE THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REALLY MATTERED IN TERMS THE ALTCOMEANING IF SOMEBODY ALREADY HAD RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF DOPAMIAN IN THI CIRCUIT INCREASING DOPAMIN FURTHER WITH BROMOCRIPTINE DIDN'T I IMPART A BENEFIT AND MIGHT HAVE EVEN MADE THEIR WORKING MEMORY WORSE SO THERE'S A KIND OF INVERTED YOUSHAPE FUNCTION TO THI A HOW DOES ONE KNOW WHETHER NOT THER BASE LINE DOPAMIN IS LOW MEDIUM OR HIGH URGO HOW DO THEY KNOW WHET OR NOT THAT THEY WOULD A ONE TO EXPLORE GOING ABOUT INCREASING DOPAMIN THROUGH ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES RIGHT FOR MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVE OFTOF AL DON'T MEAN BUT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE THAT PROBABLY HAVE TOO LITTLE OR MAY BE TOO MUCH AND IT'S UNUNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T MEASURE IN THE BLOOD AN THERE ISN'T A BLOOD TESTS THAN I AM AWARE OF THAT CAN CAN MEASURE A DON'T MEAN BECAUSE IT'S STUCK IN A SUCKIN THE BRAIN AM PREFERAL DOPAMIN IN THE BLOOD DOESN'T IS NOT A GOOD READ OUT IS NOT A GOOD READ OUT YE AND AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOURE TALKING ABOUT  DON'T MEAN AND IN ARIAS LIKE PREFRUNTAL CARTEC AND A SO WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD READ OUT THERE THERE'S THERE'S IN VASE OF PROCEDURES LIKE POSOTRONOMISSIAN TEMOGRAPHY WHERE WE CAN INJECT A RADIO IS ATO A AND THA TAGS DOPT MEAN AND THEN WE CAN MEASURE HOW MUCH WE CAN TO A SCAN THAT ACTUALLY SHOW US US HOW MUCH DOPE MEAN THIS SCAN WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED TO SHOW PARKINSECES THAT THAT YOU CAN DIGONOS PARKINS DISEASE BY SHOWING THAT THERE'S THERE'S LESS DOPE MEAN AND INPATIENCE LIKE PARKSIS BY LOOKING AT THIS THE SCAN AM OVIOUSLY IT'S IN VASOF YOUR INJECTING A EIS ITOPE IS EXPENSIVE AND ON SOMETHING WE COULD ALL DO BUT WE HAD USE S TO SHOW THAT IT CORRELATES VERY STRONGLY WITH YOUR WORKING MEMORY CAPACITYES O HOW MUCH INFORMATION YOU CAN HOLD ON LINE IF YOU CAN HOLD FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX LETTERS WHEN I DO A A SPAN TASK AM CORRELATED WITH HOW MUCH DOPE MEN WE CAN SEE N THE PETSCAN SO THAT THAT WOULD BE A AWAY THAT WE CULD DO IT A SO IF YOU WERE TO READ OUT A STRING OF A FEW NUMBERS OR LETTERS AM AND I CAN REMEMBER ALL OF THOSE A FEW MOMENTS LATER A UM PERHAPS PERHAPS MIGHT BASELINE DOBE MEAN LEVELS OR A MODERATE UM IN THE IN THE NORMAL RANGE WHEREAS IF IH COULDN'T KEEP THAT ON LINE UM THAT MIGHT BE MIGHT BE REFLECTIVE OF LOWER BASELINE DOPENING LEVELS IS THATERIGHT YES IT IS A VERY STRONG PROXY FOR DON'T MEAN SO IF YOUR YOUR WORKING OURI CAPACITY IS SEVEN LETTERS WHEN OR NUMBERS WHEN I SAY FOR OR THREE SEVEN ONE FIVE ZERO SIX IF YOU GET  WEES AL RAT VRETTY QUICKLY YOU PROBABLY HAVE MORE DOT BASELINE DO'T MEAN THAN THAN SOME ONE WHO HAS FIVE ER ISO IT'S IT'S A PROXY FOR MEASURING ONS ONWE SO THAT THAT'S ONE WAY OF DO IT AND THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW WE DID IN OUR ORIGINAL STUDIES WE WE ACTUALLY A GRUP INDIVIDUALS BASE ON WHETHER THEIR CAPACITY BASE ON THIS BEHAVERAL MEASURE WAS HIGH OR LOW AND LIKE YOU SAID THOSE WHO WORK THAT CAN ONLY HOLD FIVE OR SIX LETTERS IF WE GAVE EM BROMAL CRIPTINE WHICH WAS THE DOPENERGEGAGONISTS WE IMPROVE THEIR WORKING MEMORY AH WE GOT THEM INTO SERVANOTEN LEVEL BUT BUT THOSE WHO RE ALREADY PIE WE ACTUALLY MADE THEM WE WORK WE GOT THEM WORSE AND THE MORAL THAT STORY WAS THAT MORE IS JUST NOT BETTER WERE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OPTIMAL AND SO THE REAL QUESTION IS IS ENOUGH WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE OFTEMAL LIKE YOU WERE INFERRING YIT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEIR DON'T BEAN IS WHERE WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS INVERTED YOU CURVE ANOTHER WAY OF DOING IT I IS THROUG AM A GENET DOGENETIC STUDY SO WE HAV DON'T MEAN ALD NER TRANSMITTERS HAVE TO BE BROKEN DOWN AND REUPTAKE INTO THE INTO THE BRAINSELL IN ORDER TO BE USED AGAIN AND I'S DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT IN SOME SELLS A IT GETS TRANSPORTED BACK INTO THE BRAIN SELL AN OTHER OTHER PLACES THERE'S AN ENSIME THAT THAT BREAKS IT DOWN WHILE THERE'S AN ENZIM CALLED COMPT AH THAT IS BREAKS DOWN DONT MEAN IN THE PREFRONT OF QUARTEX SPECIFICALLY IN A LARGE PERCENTAGEOF INDIVIDUALS THAT ENSIME IS EITHER OVERACTIVE OR UNDERACTIVE PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF INDIVIDUALS IT'S OVERACTIVE IN ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IT'S UNDERACTIV SO PROBTLY HALF THE POPULATION NOW THIS IS GIN A VERY DEPEND ON OTHER WHERE YOU LIVE IN WHERE YOU COME FORM IN THINGS BUT IT BUT BUT MAYBE HALF THE POPULATION EITHER HAS AN UNDERACTIVE ENSIM OR OVERACTIVE ENS ON IF YOU HAVE AN UNDERACTIVE ENSIM AN ACTUALLY MORE DON'T MEAN SITS AROUND AND UYOU ACTUALLY HAVE MORE DOPE MEAN THAN OTHERS AND IF YOU HAVE AN OVERACTIVE ENS IN IT'S THE OPPOSITE SO WE'VE ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT IF YOU NOW GOIN GENIATIPE PEOPLE WITH A SIMPLE SALIVA TEST AND FIGURE OUT DO THEY HAVE THIS GENETIC WHAT WE CALL POLLY MORPHISOM WHERE JUST ONE TO MEANO ASSIT GETS CHANGED AND THE ENSIN BECOMES EITHER ACTIVE OR UNDERACTIVE WE CAN WE CAN DO THE SAME THING AS IS SCROUPING THEM BY THEIR CAPACITY THOSE THAT HAVE THE LOW DOPE MEAN WEILL MAKE THEM ET BETTER AND THOSE WHO HAVE SERE BASELN I DON'T MEAN WILL WILL MAKE THEM WORSE SUPERINTERESTING UM THN WE COULD TALK ABOUT BROMA CRIPTING LITTLE BIT AND I'M NOT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO RUN OUT AND TAKE BROMA CRIPTINE UM ROMACRIPTING AS YOU MENTION IS A DOPAMING AGONIST UM RELATIVELY SHORT ACTING YEV IN FOR FIVE HOURS SIX HOURS SO KIKES IN ABOUT IT NINETY MINUTES AFTER RIGHT AS I RECALL YOU SAID I HAVE NEVER TAKEN AT NUM HOW DO PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEIRE ON ROMA CRIPTINEG I MEANG WHEN I HEAR A DOPEMIN AGONISTS HAMMING THEIR LOT OF ELICIT DRUGS LIKE COCANE IT MATHEMPHETAMINE THAT AR INCREASE DOPAMINE BUT THEN AGAIN CHOCOLATE THE SAXON FOOD INCREASED DOPE ME BUT THE CANATICS THE TIME COURSE AND THE LEVELS ARE ARE DIFFERENT FOR EACH O RISE THINGS I'M DOPEMING OF COURSE BEING A CURRENCY OF MOTIVATION AND REWARD NOT NOT UM DIRECTLY RELATE ANY ONE COMPOUND BUT M I WOULD THINK THAT BASED ON THE DATA YOU JUST DESCRIBED THAT UM AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH CHALLENGES IN WORKING MEMORY ATTENTION TASKWICHING ET CETERA TIT THERE WOULD BE A STRONG INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE FARMER SUITICAL COMPANIES AT LEAST AND CERTAINLY THE GENERAL PUBLIC UM IN THINGS LIKE PROMACRIPTING TO INCREASE DOPEMEANG TO INCREASE WORKING MEMORY GIVEN IT IS OUR SUPERPOWER YE I MEAN ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING THINGS TO ME IN MY CAREER HAS BEEN THAT FARMER SROUE COMPANIES HAVE NOT PICKED UP ON THIS IDEA THAT WE COULD IMPROVE COGNITION VERY SPECIFICALLY IMPROVE KIND OF PROCESS WITH VERY SPECIFIC NARROW MODULATORS THE THE DISCOVERY THAT THE POLECEON OF DOT MEAN AND NOT OTHER TRANSMITTERS IN PAIRS WORK IN MEMORY WAS MADE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE UM WHEN I HEARD A PAT COMICIS TALK ABOUT THIS AS THE RESIDENT I WAS JUST THE MAZE THAT THERE COULD BE A SINGLE TRANSMITTER CAN CHANGE A SINGLE BEHAVIOUR I WAS SING VERY COMPLICATED BEHAVEORAL DEPHISIS HAS JUST SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO ME THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH A TIGHTLIC BETWEEN US SINGLE YOU KNOW A SINGLE NERMODULATOR IN SINGLE COINGA PROCESS AND JUST OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME THAT  THIS REALLY COULD BE A CREDIBLY BENIFICIAL THERBE FOR FOR ANY ANY ONE WITH EXECUTIVE FUNCTION OF FROM TA OF FUNCTION SO BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NEVER BEEN A FARME SOCOMEN THAS TRIED TO DEVELOP A DRUG FOR IMPROVING COGNITION TO THIS THAT'S A GOODLASIAY AND THEY I MEAN ITS CRAZY FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE IS THAT THE DATE ARE CLEARLY THERE A TOO THESE DRUGS ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED DUS NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH SAFETY TRIALS AGAIN THAT THAT'S ALREADY BE DONE BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ONE IS A FAN OF THE FARMER SUITICAL INDUSTRY OR HATES IT THE FARMER SUI INDUSTRY AND PRINCIPALE CAN MAKE A TONOMONEY DOING THAS SO I WOULD THINK THAT THEY BE HEAVILY AND SENTIVICE TO DO IT SO WI HAVE THEY AM TURNED A BLIND EYE ON THIS I 'M NOT SURE I MEAN WHEN I REALIZE THAM THAT I COULD TASTTHES STRUGS IN IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT THEY WERE IF I GAVE HIM AND LOW ENOUGH DOSEIS THEY WERE SAFE AND AND I HAD SO MUCH EXPERIENCE OF M IN PATIENCE THAT I FELT COMFORTABLE DOING IT IM THEN I STARTE ASKIG FARM SO ACCOMPANIES O O DO ON AGAIN INVOLVED HERE WEWE CAN WE THIS SHOULD BE DONE I CAN'T DO THIS BY MYSELF WE NEED TO HAVE REAL TRIALS AND REAL STUDIES OF HOW THIS WILL HELP YOU KNOW AND JUST WAS ENOTHEIR EYES WOULD ALWAYS CROSS AND NEVER NEVER GOT ANY ANY SOR ATTRACTION IN ALWAYS WENT BACK TIS SORT OF DISEASE YOU KNOW WAT WHAT DISEASE ARE YOU AM CURING YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S THE MARKET FOR IT IS A APARKINSS THESE THINGS AN ALSIMERS IS THESE THING AN THIS HAS BEEN A GENERAL PROBLEM WITH NAUROLOGY IT'S VERY DISEASE SENTRIC IT'S ALWAYS SORT OF FOOT AND IT'S ALWAYS FOCASS ON YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE DEVELPATRETON FOR HOUSIMERS OR TERMAC RANGRYOR STROKE I SUPPOSE TO HOWCOMING DEVELOP A TREATMENT FOR WORKING MEMORY TIS FUNCTION WHICH IS THE PROBLEM OF CROSS DISEASES SO TE ANSWER TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTIONS THESE DRUGS ARE VERY SAFE THEY WE GIVE IM IN SUCH LOW DOSES TO HELP THE INDIVIDUALS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY CAN'T EVEN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PLASEE BELL AND THE DRUG REALLY THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE THERE ON SO THEY'RE NOT BUZZING THINKING NO THIS FEELS GO AVE NOIN MY WORKING MEMORIES BETTER THEY AVE KNOW DID THEREN'T EVEN KNOW THEIR WORKING MEMORIES BETTER S ALWAYS WE SHOW IM THAT THEIR WORKING MEMORY IS BETTERS OF IT YE R THERE TRULY MIND TO WHAT'S GOING ON UM BROMA CRIPTINE IS BUT ONE OF THE DOPENING AGONISTS UM CAN THINK OF A FEW OTHER UM KEEP RIGOLIN LIKE OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT UM DO ANY OF THESE DOPENMING AGONISTS A EXERT THIS A IMPACT ON WORKING MEMORY OR IS IT UM THOES A VERY BY DRUG BECAUSE DIFFERENT A DOPNING AGONISTS A TO HIT DIFFERENT RECEPTOR PATHWAYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YE KNOW IT'S NOT SPECIFIC THE DRUG I MEAN THAT THE REASON FOR BRON CRIPTINE IS THAT IT'S THE OLDEST IN THITS ONE I WAS MOST COMFORTABLE WITH I HAD TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THIT CLINICALLY BEFORE I'D GIVE IT  UNDERGRADUATES THAT AT TEN OR BIRKLIES SO THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL BUT OTHER AGONISTS WORK SIMILARLY UM THERE'S A THERE'S A DRUG THAT'S DEVELPAPARTIS WHICH IS A COMPTAND HABITTER WHICH ACTUALLY INHIBIT'S THIS THIS ENDS LIME THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT AN THAT THAT ALSO WILLIN PROVE A WE'LL HAVE THE SAME AT A FUNCTION THERE'S BEEN SOME FUTRE A WORK THAT NOR UP AN NEFERAN ALSO SEEMS TO BE HELPFUL WITH WORKING MEMORY A IT'S NOT AS A MAY BE NOT IS UM PODENT AS AS THE DOPEN NURGIC AND THAT THAT'S E POINT OT ONE TO MAKE ANDOTHE ANOTHER DISAPPOINTINGTHING ABOUT THIS WHOLE FIELD WITH THE FARM ACOLOGY OF COGNITION M YOU NY I WROTE A PAPER AS A RESIDENCE UST SOMETIMES YOUR TENDING SAY CAN YOU WRITE THIS REFEW PAPER FOR US AND AND I WROTE ONE AS A RESIDENT O CALL THE FARM ACOLOGI COGNITION WHERE IS LOOKED AT ALL THE ANIMAL WERTUREON YOU KDON'T A GIVING A NERMODULATORS ASO COLING BRON A DON'T MEAN ORPEDEVERAN AND THERE WERE'S A LOT OF ATI THEREWAS A LOT OF ANIMAL LETTERTUR SOR SUPPORTING THAT THIS WOULD WORK IN UMENS BUT WAS MORE STRIKING TO ME WAS THAT IT WASN'T ALWAYS JUST A SINGLE A NER TRANSMITTER THERE WERE STUDIES WHERE YOU'D GIVE DON'T MEAN AND IT WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING GIVE ASESOL COLING IT WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT IF HE GAVE A LOWDOSE OF BOTH IT WOULD IT WOULD BE REALLY EFFACTIF SO THESE YOU KNOW THESE NURSESIS SYSTEMSTONE ACT AN ISOLATION SO WE NEEDS ALSO STUDY SORT OF HOW THE COMBIDATIONS WORK AND THAT'S WHERE ANOTHER YOU KNOW WHERE THE FARM SWICONAYS HAVE THE INFOR STRUCTURE TO DO THESE KIND OF SAYS IS VERY HARD TO DO IN A SINGLE LAV TO TO DO MULTIBL DRUGS AT AT AT ONE TIME YOU NO AND THEN TRYING LOOK AT TRYING TO TERMINE ALL THE DIFFERENT IN DIRACTIONS AY BE WE COULD TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF OTHER DRUGS UM THAT ARE LEGAL OR OF AND HAV FTY APPROVAL ARE KNOWN TO BE SAFE IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT THAT AM IT SEEMS WOULD FIT THE BILL HERE A FOR IMPROVING WORKING MEMORY ONE IS UM WELL BEUTRON BRUTE PRUPROPRUN RUPRUPAE I CAN EVER PRONOUNCE THAT UM AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S A A UM A PANEFFERIN OUR NORIP AN AFOR AN AGONIST YOU JUST MENTION THAT INCREASING UP AND OFFER MAY HAVE T A PAUSIV INPACTING WORKING MEMORY AND TO SOME EXTENDED DOPAIN AGONIST IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT UM WELL BEUTRIN CAN IMPROVE WORKING MEMORY YEAN ANYTHING THAT EM BOOSE NOR P AN AFRIN CAN DO IT THE ONE THAT WE'VE USE A THAT'S MOST USE IS GUON FASINE WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATIONS SO THAT STARTING TO GAIN SOME TRACTION IN FACT I THINK THERE WAS A STUDY WITH COA WITH BRAIN FOG FOR COVAS SHOWING THAT IMPROVE A SYMPTOMS WIT THAT SO THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME TRIALS NOW THAT  OUR LOOKING AT GON FASINE AND SO I WOULD SAY ANYTHING THAT BOOSH'S NOR UP AN AFRAN WOULD BE WOULD BE HELPFUL UM BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T WON TOM WANT TO LEAVE OUT THE OTHER TRANSMITTERS IISSIR SIRATONE AND YOUR INCREASING SARE TONE AND INCREASEOUS O COLLING BOOSE'S OTHER COGNA PROCESSES AND THEN YOU KNOW IN A WAY THEY CAN HELP WORKING MEMORY WERE WE TALK ABOUT WORKING MEMORY BEING BEING THIS FOUNDATION WHILE IF IF YOU GIVE VASSAL COLING AND CIND OF BOOSE MEMORY WHILE THET CAN INDIRECTLY HELP YOUR EXACT CONFUNCTION AR F YOU GIVE A A DRUG THAT IMPROVES YOUR FOCUSS THE TACK AND INDIRECTLY HELP YEU NO WORKING MEMORY SO WHEN I AM REALLY PUSHING FORCS IS NOT JUST SO SINGLE YOU NOTS CAN BE ONE DRA OU NO ONE DRUG IT'S GAIN TO BE A COCKTAIL AND WE HAVE TE NOT ONLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COCKTELL IS BUT ALSO FIGURE OUT WHO WERE GIVEN IT TO WHAT'S TOT YOU KNOW LINK ET TO THE PERSONS OWN MAKE UP OF THEIR OWN YOUR CHEMISTRY WHEN WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE'LL KNOW WE CAN MAGH OUTS OR EVERYONES DON'T MEAN NOR UP ANEFERENCE ARE TON LEVELS O THEN WILL MAKE REAL PROGRESS AND AND HELPING THEM BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I SORT SAY WITH MY STUDENTS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TO O UST LIKE CUTTING OPIN THE CULL ANTO SORT POURING IN ON TO THE BRAIN  NOT  LY BUT ACTUALLY DOING IF BUT IT SEEMS THAT WAY WER N THE PRECISION IS NOT THERE YET WILL YOU IT'S GREAT THAT YOU DEVELOPED THIS AM COGNE OF TASK THAT CAN BE A PROXY FOR DOPAMING LEVELS THE COGNIVE TASK AGAIN BEING UM HOW MANY NUMBER LETTER STRING SOMEBODY CAN REMEMBER UM BASELY WORKING MEMORY PERFORMANCE UM THERE ARE A LOT OF TESTS OUT THERE THAT CLAIM U THEY CAN ASSESS DOPAMIN AND SERETONE IN A SYT OF COLLING LEVELS FROM A BLOOD DRAW U'M AFRAID OF THE DUTCH TEST I'VE NEVER R TAKIN IT UM BUT A FEW MOR MINUTES AGO YOU SAID THAT REALLY WEONE NEEDS TO DO POSITRONOMISSION TOMOGRAPHY IMAGANE WHICH IS FAIRLY LABOUR INTENSIVE MOST PEOPLE DON'T OF ACCESS TO ONE OF THOSE UM T'S A CLINICAL TOOL UAM SO THERE BEHAVIOUR AL PROXIES THERE'S NARRO IMAGING BUT ALSO TO MY KNOWLEDGE I I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANY BLOOD DRAW THAT WILL SAY HEY YOU'RE CERETONEAN LEVELS OR LOWER YOURE DOPENMA LEVELS OR ARE MODERATE YOURS A T ET CETERA THERE'RE LOT OF COMPANIES THAT MARKET THESE BUT ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY CLINICAL OR OTHER TOOLS FOR GETTING AN ACCURATE READ OF NER TRANSMINO LEVELS IN IN A PERSON'S BRAIN ASIDE FROM NARRO IMAGING NO AND  AN IT'S IT'S EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN T SEEMS BECAUSE THE DOBERNER SYSTEM IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY JUST THE PRE FROM THE QUARTEX AS WE TALKED ABOUT US ALSO THE BASL GANGLEA AND A SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO MEASURE DON'T MEAN JUST GENERALLY LEVELS WE HAVE TO MEASURE THE BALANCE OF THE DON'T MEAN IN THESTRY IT UM AND THE AND THE PREFROMA QUARTEX THERE'S THERE'S A MODEL OF DON'T MEAN AM FUNCTION AND IT'S RELATION EXT IT EXECTIVE FUNCTION HIT HAS TO DO WITH SORT OF THE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS THAT DON'T MEAN IN THE PREFRONT OF QARTEX IS PROMOTING SORSTABILITY IT'S IT'S KEEPING INFORMATION IND MIND SKEEPING THESE REPRESENTATIONS STABLE WHERE IS THE DON'T MEAN IN THE BASL GANGLE WHAT IT'S DOING IS IS ALLOWING YOU TO UPDATE AND REFRESH YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT YOUR THAT YOU'RE HOLDING IN MIND THIS SOR STABILITY FORSIS FLEXIBILITY SO IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH DOBIN FROM THE QUARTES I CANLY TO A VERY RIGID STATE WHERE YOU YOU DON'T LET ANYTHING IN AND AND IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH DON'T MEAN THE STRATUM AND YGET TOO FLEXIBLE THAN YOUCAN GET VERY DISTRACTABLE SO THERE'S A SORT OF BALANCE OF DON'T MEANS SO IT'S NOT JUST HOW MUCH DON'T MEAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR BRAIN IT'S IT'S HOW MUCH WHAT'S THE BALANCE OF THE DON' MEANS I DON'T SEE A BLOOD TESS AS EVER GIVING US THAT INFORMATION BUT I DO SEE THER BEING A A BRAIN TEST THAT THAT CAN THAT CAN GIVE US THIS KIND OF OF INFORMATION OF ATHE TO OR LEAST A PROXY FOR IT SO WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ASKING THIS QUESTION YOU KNONT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU MEASURE PUPILARY PUPIL DILATION THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD PROXY FOR NOR FOR T E NORAGENERTIC SYSTEM IIT SO AT TO GIVEN A PEOPLEL WONDER WHAT AM HOW TO DO IT WHERE NOCIN A AM GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL HERE BUT AT A GIVEN BRIGHTNESS IN THE ROOM WHAT WE CALL LUMINANCE A THE PUPIL TENDS TO BE SMALLER WHEN IT'S BRIGHT AND LARGER WHEN IT'S A YOU'RE IN A DIM ROOM THAT SORT OF OBVIOUS M BUT AT A GIVEN LUMINANCE THE MORE ALERT AROUSED SOMEBODY IS UAM AROUSAL IS A GENERAL TERM HERE AM NOT NOT TALKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR KIND OF AROUSAL THAN THE PUPILTENS TO BE MORE DILATED IT GETS BIGGER THE MORE A NORPAN FFERONT ISN'T IS RYIN THE SYSTEM SO IF SOMEBODY'S PUPILS ARE REALLY BIG IN BRIGHT LIGHT A PERSONS GOT A LOT OF A APAN EFFERAN A DRENALIN I IN THEIR SYSTEM ARE YOU USE THIS CLINICALLY A A WHEN SOME ONE COMES IN AN THEY THE BIG OLL YEL YET PPOY IN YOU LIKE  CA THEIRE PROBBLY ON A STIMULANT YES I MEAN A LOT OF ANROLOGY DOES IS IS TRY TO LOOK FOR THESE WINDOWS INTO THE BRAIN AND SO I THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF WINDOWS INTO THE BRAIN THAT WE'REGAN TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THAC AND REFLECT THESE NERMAITORY SYSTEM SO THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN SO INTERESTED AND DEVELOPING BILE MARKERS BECAUSES REALLY WHAT A NARROL BILE MARKER IS IS IS TRYING TO A DEVELOPD SOMETHING YOU CAN MEASURE EASILY AND SIMPLY AND CHEAPLY WITH YOU KNOW BUT GIVES YOU INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN IS WORKING AND SO THAT'S A BI YOU NOW THAT'S A NUR UP AN NOUGH FROM BY A MARKER WORKAN MARRIN CAPACITIES AT DON'T MEAN BY A MARKER AND AND WE'RE GETTING BETTER AT THAT BUT A GAN WE'RE NOT PUTTING ENOUGH EMPHASIS ON IT IN MY OPINION TO REALLY SORT OF HELP YOU KNOW IMPROVE BRAIN HEALTH HAVE YOU EVER TRIED BROMACRIPTINE VERY EARLY ON BUT IT'S IT'S SUCH A LOW DO YOU KNOW THAT AT THE DOSE THAT THE MY SUBJECTS WERE GETTING BY LIKE I SAID IT DOESN'T IT'S SO LOW YOU DON'T FELL INTHING AND I SHOULD SAY WITH EVEN WITH PATIENCE AM THAT TAKE IT THEY THEY RARELY GET INY SIDE AF FACTS SOMETIMES A WITH THESE TRUGS BECAUSE TERS PERFL DON'T MEAN THEY CAN GET A OUN NAUSYR OING BUT IT'S EXTREMELY WELL DOLERAE YOU DON'T GET ANY ANY ANYTHING FEELING FROM IT DOES IT CHANGE REACTION TIME IT DOES AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION OF OF HOW MUCH OF IS IS THAT WHICH JUS SOR SPEEDING UP WICHUST OR MAKING THEM FASTER BUT FOR ALL THE WORK WE'VE DONE IT'S IT'S PRETTY CONVINCING THAT IT'S IT'S NOT JUST HOW FAST YOU' DOING IT YOU'RE DOING IT BETTER A YOU MIGHT FIND THIS ENTERTAINING UM SOME YEARS AGO A I LEARNED THAT ATHLETES A WE'RE TAKING BROMA CRIPTINE A PREOLYMPICS AND IN THE OLYMPICS I THINK IT'S A BAND SUBSTANCE NOW UM AND THE ATLEATS THAT WE'RE TAKING IT DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW THIS BUT I COULD TELL YOU OFF LINE U AND I'M NOT ONE OF THESE ATHLETES NOR WAS I SUPPLYING THE BROMCRIPTINE WE'RE USING IT BECAUSE A THAT THEY WERE SPRINTERS AND IT TURNS OUT THE LOT OF THE SPRINT RACES ARE ONE A BY BEING FIRST OUT THE BLOCKS THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS AS WELL BUT THAT REACTION TIME YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF MILL A SECONDS ARE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PODIUM IN NOPOTIUM UM AND BROMA CRIPTINE WAS ONE OF THE DRUGS THE USED IT WAS NOT ON THE BAND SUBSTANCE ILIST I JUST A REMIND HER THAT EVERY LYMPICS YOU SEE THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS BEING USE THAT ARE NOT ON THE BAND SUBSTANCE LESS AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE DISPARAGING I THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT OF INTERESTING AUGMENTING ER EMODULATION FOR NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION BROMACRIPTINE WAS TOPITALIST AT THAT TIME I THINK IT'S ON THE BAND LIST NOW U THERE'S A LOT OF A USE OF FARMA COLLEGY NOW ON COLLEGE CAMPASES AND IN HIGH SCHOOL AND EVEN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND SOMETIMES BY PARENTS FOR THEIR KIDS TO TRYING IMPROVE COGNE OF FUNCTION MOST TYPICALLY THE USE OF ATERALL VIVEANTS RIDDLE IN IND OTHER STIMULANTS WHICH ARE NORATRIDERGICDOPEMEN URGIC AGONIS OCESE SO UM WITH THE A DISCLAIMER COVIAT WHAT EVER YOU WONE TO CALL IT THAT YOU KNOW THOSE DECISIONS SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE WITH I A TRAINED PSYCHITRIST UM MONITERING THINGS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT UM FORM A COLLEGY FOR ENHANCING COGNEIF FUNCTION GIVEN THAT THE LANDSCAPE OF SOCIETY IS CHALLENGING AND PEOPLE WANT TO PERFORM WHELL THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS WE GOT SMART PHONES DISTRACTING US AND UM TO SOME EXTEND UM YOU KNOW ONE COULD SAY ALLL IT'S CHEATING TO USE FORM A COLLOGY BUT A CUP OF COFFEE IS A BIT OF A NORAGERAN ERGIC AGONIST SO AND DUM CERTAINLY CAN PRUSE MY FOCUS IN ALLAS DON'T DERING TOO MUCH OF IT I UM YET WOLE YOUR THOUGHTS A JUST YE I THINK IT YOU KNOW A KIND OF GETS BACK TO  WE TALKED ABOUT THERE BEING AN OTIMLE YOU KNOW OTEMAL LEVEL OF OF DOT MEAN IN YOUR BRAIN I I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS JUST MORE AND MORE AND MORE IS BETTER AND THAT MORE IS BETTER THAN THERE'S REALLY KNOW AND DI CERTAILY KNOW  THE HAWD YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU SHOULD BE TAKING THIS SER A IS WOMEN WAS RUNING MY ADIES  ALL THE COKIN AND A CULTURE OF OF WALL STREET IN THE EIGHTIES THAT WE HATHER MOVIES ABOUT IT AND IT DOESN'T LEAD TO GOOD PLACES RIGHT RIGHT SO SO I'M ALL FOR OPTIMIZING FUNCTION A BEGO WANT OFTEMISE BRAIN HEALTH AN IF YOU HAVE AN UNDER ACT OF YOU KNOW ENSIN THAT'S NOT THAT THAT MAKES YOUR DON'T MEAN LEVELS THAN I'M ALL FOR TRYING TO OF TEMISE THAT ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE WE NEED OPTEMZE IN THE BRAIN SO IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHO I YET WHO IS SORT OF ON THE LOWER AND AN BOOST THEM UP I'M ALL FOR THAT THE PROMISE WE DON'T KNOW THEY'RE ON THE HIGH END AND SOME OF THSE ATTLES WERE ACTUALLY MAKING THEMSELVES WORSE WE KNOW FOR SORE I'M  THESE ARE HEALTHY TEN AND BERKLY UNDERGRADURAS THAT WE MADE THEM WORSE ON WORKING MERRY TEST YOU KNOW I I INCREASE LIKE MY INCREASING THER DOT MAN A JUST A LITTLE AMOUNT JUST TIP THEM OVER JUST A LITTLE LITTLE AMOUNT AND A AND SO WEYOU NON'T WITHOUT THE KNOWING THAN IT JUST IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT WELL INFORMED YOUR AN TO BE TAKING THE OTHER THING IS I I I IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WE SHOULD DO IT RIGHT I THINK DRUGS LIKE AT AR ALL IN RIDDLE AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE DEVELOPED BECAUSE THEY HELPED PATIENCE BUT THEY WARN'T NESTALLY DEVELOPED WITH KNOWING HOW EXACTLY THEY WORKD AN THAT'S HOW THE FARM SINGLE COMPANY WORK TAT AS ARISE TO YE I MAN T TO IT WORK SO THATS TON I'M ALL FOR THAT AS A PHYSICIAN UM BUT IF I HAD MY CHOICE A YOU KNOW DRUGS THAT BOOST UP MULTIML SIS ALL THE CATACOLA MEANS THE ONCES THAT PUSAP DOPE ME EPAN EPERAN AND NORMAN AFER AN I I WOULD STEER AWAY FROM THOSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER HOW YOUR MODULAING THE SYSTEM AGAIN I'VE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT A COCKTELL ITS IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT O DOPE MEN IN A LITTLE MORE NORE IN EFFERENT BUT IF YOU GIVE TAKE THEM LIKE RIDDLEAN OUR ALL YOU JUST GIN THE SAME AMOUNT SO IS IT'S KIND OF IF I WAS TO START TA SORT OF EXPERIMENT A THAN I I'D EXCEPT BOUN I WOULDN'T USE TAT AR ALL A RIDDLAN AS THAT AS THE DRUG THAT I THINK WIT HEALTHFUL EVEN THOUGH THERE CLINICALLY SER OFE YOU SOL I USE THINGS LIKE FROWN CRIPTINE QUONPACINE WERE THEY CONMODULATE A VERY SPECIFIC DRUG AND THEN AND THEN YOT THAN THE GOAL IS TO TOF TEMISE AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH COGNA THE THER THERABE AND EVERYTHING SLEEPING BETTER AND BETTER NINTUREST ALL THESE ARE AIMING TO OTHEMIZE NOT YOU KNOW REACH SOME SUPER YOU MAN FITENTIAL RIGHT JUST BRING OUT THE BEST IN IN PEOPLE'S ABILITIES RM AND I'M I'M SO GLAD YOU MENTION SLEEP UM I WAS SAY YOU A SLEEP IS THE THE BETTER ACK ITS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE AMEAN WITHOUT THAT FARM ACOLOGY MIGHT BRIDG YOU FOR AN AFTERNOON BUT YOU CAN TO PAY THE PIPER SOMEHOW UM OUR FRIENDIN COLLI MATWALKER  OBVIOUSLY IS A IN BEATING THAT DRUM A WHILE UM WHAT ABOUT DRUGS LIKE MODAPANIL WHICH OUR THOUGHT TO BE TRUE COGNIOF INHANCERS UM AS OPPOSED TO UM DRUGS THAT JUST COND OF R DESIGN TO RAMP UP LEVELS OF ALERTNESS I IMANY THE DRUGS WERE DISCUSSING DO YET'S HARD TO KNOW I MAY I THINK CERTAIN UM DRUGS JUST IMPROVE GENERAL ABILITIES EITHER THEY BEE HOW FAST YOU CAN PROCUS ET OR HOW EFICIENT YOU CAMPROCUS OR OR NARROW THE FOCUS OF YOUR TENTION AND THAT JUST HELPS ALL ABILITIES SO IT'S SO SO IT'S HARD TO SAY I THINK TIS HIS HAS TO BE MORE WORK I'N REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT SPECIFICALLY AH YHOU NOT THESE DRUGS ARE DOING THAT'S QUIKE PRON CRIPTING THE THE DOBENARK STORIES BEEN SO INTURESAND BECAUSE IS A VERY SPECIFIC A FACT OR THE VERY SPECIFIC MECHANISM I LIKE TO SEE THAT BE DONE WITH WITH OTHER NER MODULATORS MAY WE COULD TALK A BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE DISEASE CONDITIONS THAT YOU TREAT AND THE ROLL OF WORKING MEMORY IN DOPENING IN THOSE CONDITIONS AS WELL AS OTHER TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS YOU KNON ONE SUBJECT THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ON THIS PARD CAST A PREVIOUSLY BUT IS OF TREMENDOUS INTEREST TO PEOPLE IS TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY ER CONCUSSION EVEN MILD CONCUSSION AND UM BEFORE WE  WERE RECORDING DAY WE ARE TIME OUT FOOTBALL BUT SONE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT FOOTBALL IS JUST ONE INSTANCE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A CONCUSSION OR DRAMATIC BRAIN INTRY MOST DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY CUSSION IS NOT DO TO FOOTBALL IT JUST GETS A LOT OF THE ATTENTION BUT YOU'VE GOT BI SCAL ACCIDENTS CAR ACCDENTS PLAYGROUND ACCIDENTS UM A MAYBE COULD LIST OUF A FEW MORE UM BUT HOW COMMON IS TBY I IN CONCUSSION AND AND MAYBE COULD JUST PERHAPS I LIST OUT SOME OF THE OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE YOU SEE A LOT OF THIS U THAT IT'S A BIT MORE CRIPTIC THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T USCERILY THINK THAT SPORTER THAT THAT POPULATION GETS TEBEI WHAT THEY DO YE I THINK CONCUSSION I IS MUCH MORE PROVALENT THAN WE WE REALIZE AND AND THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP AND UP NOP BECAUSE IT'S BECOMING MORE COMMICIOUS IS BECOMING MORE RECOGNIZE AND I THINK I YOU KNOW WE WE UNDER ESTIMATED AND TRIVEALIZE OR WHAT A CONCUSSION IS YOU KNOW AS IS THAT IS JUST THE YOU AS SOMETHING THAT IS AM THOU NOT JUST YOU'RE GING TO RECOVER FROM IT I MEAN STILL THE OLD SCHOOL THINKING BY A A LOT OF NRALL JUS IS THAT EVERY ONE GETS BETTER WITHIN A COPLEAMONS YOU KNOW JUST JUST WAIGHTED OUT AND YOU'LL GET BETTER THAT'S JUST OF THE NORMAL TIME COURSE OF CONCUSSION BUT AS WE'VE STUDIED IT MORE I WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S AA QUITE A LARGE PERCENTGEOF PEOPLE WHO A YEAR OUT THERE'S STILL SUFFERING PROBLEMS THEY STILL FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT MENTALLY CLEAR AND THEY STILL ARE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT AND THEY STILL FEEL A LITTLE DIZZY AND N JUST THE SYMPTEMYUKNOS A HOST OF SYMPTOMS THAT JUST ONE YEAR LATER AFTER A CONCUSSION WHERE THEY DIDN'T EVEN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE EVEN TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR ABOUT IS IS  IS IS LINGERING UM AND SO IT'S A REAL THIS WE CALL TUS PERSISTENT POST CONCUSSIONS IN GERMAN THAT'S THE MOST WORRISOME TO ME  BECAUSE IT IS TRUE THAT MOST CONCUSSIONS WILL RECOVER LUCKI THE BRAIN IS INCREDIBLY RASILIENS INCREDIBLY PLASTIC AND IT IT WILL HEEL ITSELF UM BUT THEY'RE A LOT OF PATIENCS WHERE JUST IT JUST PERSISTS IN THOSE OF THE MOST WORRISOME TO ME BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE VERY GOOD INTERVENTIONS TO TRY AND HELP THAT ANDI DON'T THINK WE TAKE THESE PATIENCS VERY SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY'RE COMPLAINING OF SOMETHING THAT SEEMS VERY VAGUE AND NOT VERY SPECIFIC TO MOST OS ADOCTORS WHAT DO YOU TELL A PATIENT WHO COMES IN AND IT'S CLEARLY HOW TO CONCUSSION UM MY OLD WOR SEVERE CONCUSSION YOU MAYBE CAR ACCIDENT MAYBE SPORTS INJURY MAYBE THEY WERE KNOCKED OUT COLD MAYBE NOT BUT THEYRE AVING SOME HEADACHES AN PHOTOFO BE A YOURE SENSITIVEY LIGES FEELING NOT RIGHT I I'VE HAD IT A COUPLE THESE UM UNFORTUNATELY AND YU JUST FEEL OFF YOU ON' FEEL QUITE RIGHT UM AND SOME OF THAT MANIFESTIS FOCUS ISSUES THIS WAS SOME YEARS AGO I LIKE TO THIN IM THROUGH IT I'VE HAD SCANS AND IM GOOD UM THINK THINK IN TISS UM BUT WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM BESIDES DON'T GET ANOTHER ONE YE WILL FIRST OF ALL I I EXPLAIN WHAT A CONCUSSION IS WHEN I'VE FOUND ANOUROLOGY LOT OF WHAT PATIENCE ONE TO KNOW IS JUST THAY JUST ONE UNDERSTAND THEIR PROBLEM THAT WALKING IN EXPECTING A CURE IT JUST JUST A UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS HAVING SOME ONE UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM IS IS VERY HELPFUL AND UNCOMFORTING SO WHAT WE MEAN BY CONCUSSION AND WE IN THE CLINICAL WORLD WILL USE MOLTRAMATIC BRANJURY KONISAN ONESTLY WITH CONCUSSION A IT IT'S IT BASELYIS IS A TEARING OF AXONS IT'S THE BRAIN THE BRAIN SELLS HAVE THESE LONG FIBRES THAT COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND THE'RE CALLED AXONS AND WHEN THE BRAIN VIOLENTLY MOVE FORWARD AND BACKWARDS IF YOU'RE IN A CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVE YU SEE BELT ON AND YOU SUDDENLY HIT YOU GO FROM FIFTY TO ZERO YOURE HEAD VIOLENTLY GOES FORWARD AND VILABLY GOES BACKWARDS AND THAT ANGULAR FORCE ACTUALLY TEARS AND STRETCHES AXONS IN THE BRAINS SO IF YOU HAD A CONCUSSION YOU HAVE TORN SOME AXONS AN LUCKILY WE HAVE BILLIONS HUF AND SO IF YOU TEAR A COUPLE O THOUSAND YOU YOU WILL RECUT YOUWILL RECOVER BUT YOU YOU HAVE TORN AXS ON THITS A REAL NOR LOGIC IT'S A REAL R AIN INJURY EVEN IF IF EVEN IF YOU HAVE AN LOST TA CONSCIOUSNESS AND YOU'VE ONLY AS SYMPTOMS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS UM BUT THERE AN IS A CORRELATION THE LONGER YOU'VE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE LONG YOUR SYMPTOMS LAST AN WAR AXCONS YOU YOU'VE TORN THIS KIND OF A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO SO THE SO THE MECHANISM IS IS THESE TORNACSEN SO NOW OF NURSE OF DON'T COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND YOU KNOW THAT THE THE BRAIN DIFFERENT BRAIN REAGERS ARE NOT COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER I'M SO AND IT TURNS OUT THE MOST COMMON PLACE FOR ACTS ON CETERS AND IN THE FRONT O LOPS AND SO NOW WE TALKED ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS AT THE FRONT HE LIBS DUE TO WORKINGSTRAIGHT THE REST OF THE BRAIN WHILE IT DOESN'T IT HAS SOME INJURED PATHWAYS AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT PATIENTS HAVE ARE THESE KIND OF MILDS EXECUTIVE SYMPTOMS THIS THIS MENTAL FOGNESS THAT THEIRE DESCRIBING IS THIS ABILIT JUST THIS UNABILITY TO TO TO GET THINGS GET THINGS DONE THEY DON'T LOSE KNOWLEDGE OF WHO THEY THEY DON'T FOR GET THEIR NAME OR YOU DON'T FORGET WHERE THEY LIVE OR LOSE MEMORIES FROM THE PAST OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT THEY JUST THEY DON'T OFFICIALLY GET THINGS DONE AS WELL AS THEY USE TO AND ONLY TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF A DROP RIGHT YOU PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BIG A DROP IN PERFORMANCE TO HAVE I HAVE A REAL LIFE IN PACT JUST SO ONE PER CENT DROP AND YOUR YOU HAVING A HARD TIME DOING YOUR BYCASTOR E TEACHING A LECTURER OR WHATEVER YOU MIGHT DO BU ONE PER CENT DROP SOUNDS LIKE A UM A FRIGHTENINGLY SMALL CHANGE UM AVE REQUIRED TO TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT LIFE SO UM OWBUT A POOR NIGHTS SLEEP ME WHAT KIND OF DROP IN PREFRUNT AL CORTICAL FUNCTION ARE WE LOOKING AT OM FROM LET'S AY I'DNORMALLY GET SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS OR SIXTY EIGHT HOURS AND I ODENLY ONLY GET THREE OR FOUR ARE WE TALKING A SIGNIFICANT DETRIMENT I I DO THINK SO I I DO THINK THAT YET THAT THAT THAT THE IT IS SIGNIFICANT THIS IA POOR NIGHT'S SLEEP AND AND AND WE ALL NOW WE ALL NOTICE THAT I MEAN IT'S VERY IT'S VERY OBVIOUS I MEAN UM AND YU AND AND YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SOR OF QUANTIFY I I'M A BASEBALL FAN SO I CAN QUANTIFY IT LIKE IT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN A PICTUR AND HOW FAST THEY THROW YOU KNOW A SMALL DROP FOR THEM F SOME ONE IS THROWING A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR JUST A SMALL DROP TURNS THEN YOU NOW FROM REALLY A LEE TO SOME ONE MEDIOCRE MAYBE IT'S MORE OF AT TEN PER CENT DROPBUT BUT IT'S STILL RELATIVELY SMALL DROP CAN HAVE A UGE IN FACT I THINK PEOPLE THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE YOUR LITTLE BIT OFF THAT'S NOT AND THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL YOU CANA YOU CINT OF WORK THROUGH IT AND THAT'S WHAT MOST TALKTORS SA IUST JUST JUST PLOUGH THROUGH IT JUST JUST WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH WICH YOU'RE GING TO GET BETTER AND UM I SUPPOSE TO SAYING YE YOU REALLY HAVE A BRANGERY UM THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WE NEED TO REABILITATE YOU JUST LIKE WE WOULD DO IF YOU TOR YOUR ANTERCRUCIALIGAMEN I DON'T KNOW WHY TEARING YOUR CUSIA LIGIM IN OR YOUR KILLY'S TENDAND GETS MORE INTEREST THEN THEN TEARING AXONS IN IN YOUR BRAIN IT'S IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT THAT THERE'S MORE EMPHASIS ON NORTHPETIC INJURIES THAN THAN BRAIN INJURIES YE I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS EITHER I THINK THE BRAIN IS MYSTERIOUS ENOUGH THAT UM MOST PEOPLE AN AND UM MANY CLINITINS US COUN TO BACK AWAY WITH HANDS RAISED BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE FEELD OF NAUROLEGY OUR SYCHI TR ASPOS IT THAN ONE HAS OFFICIALLY SIGNED ON TO TRYIAND RESOLVINGS MATTERS IM I FOR SOMEBODY THAT AM HAS A DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY OR OR LOW LEVEL CONPUT CONCUSSION EXCUSE ME IM WOULD PART OF THE A PRIMARY ADVICE BEED TO TRYING GET ONE'S SLEEP AS AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE BE GIVEN THAT SLEEP DEPROBATION CAN COMPOUND I'M DRAMATIC BRIN INJURY A INDUCE DEFISIST AN WORKING MEMORY AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE A GOOD PORTION OF THE DEFISISTEN WORKING MEMORY DUE TO UM DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURYING CONCUSSION IS BECAUSE OF THE SLEEP DEPROBATION THAT IT CAN CALL UT SO IT GETS IT CAN GET CIRCULAR  NOT ONLY THAT BUT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS THAT PATIENCE MY PATIEN WITH CUSSION HAVE IS IS THER SLEEP IS ISTERRUPTIVE THAT THEY THE AND THAT'S TRUE IN NAROLEGE IT'S FASCINATING ALMOST EVERY NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER MY PATIENTE COMPLAIN THEIR SLEEP AND AND I START O ASKING YOU KNW NOT A LOT AN RAL TO SAS YOU HOW YOUR SLEEP YOU KNOW BUT I REALLY REEME BACK FROM MY REDSY ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS MY ATTENDING WULD DO WHN WE GOT TO THE WARDERS THAT AC TOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT AND T JUST A CROSS THE BARD YOU KNOW PATIENCE OR NOT FALLN ASLEEP BUT THEY'RE NOT STAY IN ASLEEP AND I'S IT'S A WE STILL UNDERSTAND WHY JUST BRAIN INJURY DOES THAT SOME ALMOST EVERY CONCOSSIENT PATIENCE SAYS I'M NOT SLEEPING WELL WHICH THEN COMPOUNDS YOU KNOW COMPOUNDS THE PROBEM SO OFTEMIZE I SLEEP OBVIOUSLY OPTOBIZE IND UTRITION IM THERE'S A A QUESTION ABOUT ACTIVITY IT USED TO BE THAT I WUSED TO RECOMMEND YOU KNOW HAT A CONCUSSION YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD THET DON'T GO TO WORK YOU KNOTS SLEEP YOU KNOW JUT JUST TAKE IT EASY FOR WHILE DON'T EXERCI KEEP THE BLOT EE BLIND AFTER ON NOW IT'SIT'S IT'S THE IDEA THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY GET UP AND MOVING AS BEST YOU GOT YOU GOT A DO WHAT YOU CAN TOLERATE YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF AT YOU OFF YOU DON WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF MORE OF A HEADACHE AR MORE LIKHE SENSITIVITY BUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN TOLERATE IS IS THE THE THOUGHT THESE DAYS ABOUT SORT OF PROMOTING RECOVERY AND THEN REALLY GETTING YOUR BRAIN BACK WORKING I THINK YOU KNOW LOT OF MY PATIENCE THEY'RE OFF FROM WORK FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AND THEY FEEL FINE AND THEY THEY THINK THE PRETTY MUCH NORMAL THAN THE FIRST DAY O WORK AS A COMPLETE DISASTER BIGUS UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY TEST IT IN REAL LIFE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE IS YOU HAVE SO I DON'T RECOMMEND GOING BACK FULL STEEM BUT I DO RECOMMEND GOING BACK TRYING TO BUILD UP THESE THES STILLS SKILLS AGAIN AND THEN I THINK WE  I THINK WE NEED TO DEVOLOP THERAPIECE THAT PEOPLE WILL WILL USE UM YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE GOLD MANMEN TRAINING WHICH INVOLVES A THERAPES HAN YOU KNOW PEALTHINSURANCE DOESN'T PAY FOR THIS SO NINETY NINE PER CENT OF MY PATIENCE DON'T GET ANY HELP YOU KNOW BY ANY KIND OF INTERVENTION A UNFORTUNATELY BUT NOW WE TALK ABOUT T ACNOLEGY THINGS LIKE AM BRAINA CU YOU KNOW ABOUT BRAINI BACUS O MIKE MERSONIC A WHICH I KNOW YOUVE TALKED ABOUT WITH THAT HE UM DEVELOPED A A A A A COMPANY CALL POSIT SCIENCE FOR WERE DEVELOPED THESE BRAIN TRAINING GAMES THAT THAT CAN HELP AND PROVE SPECIFIC COGNIT OF FUNCTIONS AND THEY'RE VERY EASY TO DO BECAUSE THEY'RE ON LINE AND THEY YOU NOT THEIR TER SCIENCE BEHIND THEM AND AND YOU CAN YOU CAN DO IM SO THAT IN THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE A THERAPISTS IN YOUR ROOM BUT YOU CAN ON LINE SORT OF DO THESE SORT OF THINGS THAT ARE TARDENING SPECIFIC MEC MECHANISMS TOR TRYING TO IMPROVE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPAIRED BY CONCUSSION AND I LIKE TO SEE MORE PATIENCE GETS STARTED ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS VORDARLY YIF YOU GO ON THE WAB AND JUST O DO BRAIN TRAINING YOU'LL BE OVERWHELMED WITH THINGS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WORKS ONE WHAT DOESN'T WORK E I I THINK THE WORK THAT MERSONIC AND COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE AND WI'LL PROVIDE A LING TO THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCIAL STAKE IN HIS IN HIS WORK OR PRODUCTS UM TRAININGS THAT IS UM BUT I WILL SAY I THINK MIKE'S WORK HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS OM AND YE IS SO FAR AHEAD OF THE CURVE TWENTY YEARS AGO EVERYONE WIS TIKEABOUT NARROW PLASTICITY IN CRITICAL PERIODS UM THEY GIVE A NO ABOLT PRIZE TO IT TO MY SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRANDPARENTS DAVID HUBON'T TORRENSOME WHEASEL UM AND THEY DESERVE THAT NOBOLE PRIZE BUT TERE WAS A AND OF A CENTRAL TENANT OF NARROW SCIENCE AT THAT TIME WAS THAT CRITICAL PURIO PLASTICITY ENDS AROUND ADOLESCENCE OR ONE'S EARLY TWENTIES AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE IN MERSONIC REALLY I THINK ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVES CREDIT FOR UM MAKING IT CLEAR THAT PLASTICITY IS ON GOING I TAKES SOME FOCUS IN AND A WORK TO ACCESS IT IN ADULTHOOD BUT THAT WE CAN ALL ACCESS NORO PLASTICITY BUT IT IT TAKES IT'S THERE SO O ON THEY SHULD GIVE MERSAN IC AN KNO BELL TOO BUT THAT YOU NOM NOT ON THE COMMITTEE SO UM JUST ILE EDITORIAL THERE THE DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC COGNY OF TRAININGS THAT CAN IMPROVE WORKING MEMORY IN PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD TRAMATIC BRIN INTURIOR CONCUSSION AS WELL AS OUR EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRONTA LOD FUNCTION AND PLASTESE AF FRONT TA LOW FUNCTION MAKES ME WONDER IS THE WORKING MEMORY CIRCUITRY AND FRONTA LOW FUNCTION A USIT OR LOSE IT KIND OF CIRCUIT MEANING IF SOMEBODY YOU DON'T GOS T A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN GETS INTO A A LIFE STYLE OR COLLEGE IN THE GARGERYS COLLEGE AS WELL AND THEN GETS INTO A LIFE STYLE WHERE THEY'RE NOT READING VERY MANY BOOKS THEYRE DEAFLING SCROLLING SOCIAL MEDIA THEYRE CARRYING OUT THEIR DAILY TASKS WITH YU KNOW APPARENTLY A HIGH DEGREE OF FUNCTIONALITY UM BUT THEYARE NOT REALLY PUSHING THESE FORBRAIN CIRCUITS DO WE IMAGINE THAT SOME OF THOSE FORBRAINE CIRCUITS REGRESS UM AC USE IT OR LOSE IT UM SEEMS TO ME THAT A FEW YEARS BACK MAY BE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS BACK THATE WAS A LOT OF INTEREST IN YOU KNOW HOW TO MAINTAIN COGNAN FUNCTION IN FACT WON HE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I WOULD GET EVEN AS A NURSCIENTIST PRIMARILY FOLKSST ON THE VISUAL AND NOT ANOMIC NOROUS SYSTEM WAS HOW DO I KEEP MY MEMORY AS I AGE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TRAINING IT UP AND THEN CONTINUING TO USE THOSE CIRCUITS AS IT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD WAY READING BOOKS WITHOUT FORCING ONESELF TO FINISH THE CHAPTER EVEN THOUGH DISTRACTIONS JUMP INTO ONES SAID THINGS LIKE THAT A FOR ME IT'S WHEN I GO THO JIM I TRYING NOT TO BRING MY PHONE AND IF I DO ALL THIS INTO ONE ALBUM OF MUSIC BUT I WON'T ALLOW MYSELF TO PLAYIN MY PHONE I TRY I MEAN NOT INTERRUPTING A CONVERSATION WIT TEXT MESSAGING I MEAN BASY THAT THE LANDSCAPE I'M TRYIN TO A DRAW HERE IS SEEMS LIKE THE WORLD IS DESIGNE TO TO DISRUPT THAT THE MODERN WORLD IS DESINE TO DISRUPT WORKING MEMORY IN COGNITION OF THE FRONT ALONGS AND WE NEED TO DO SOME REAL TRAINING JUST LIKE MUSCLES AND ATROPHY AND CARDIACPITNESS ATROPHES IF WE'RE NOT DOING READY A YOUN O RESISTANCE IN CARTY OF ASCULAR TRAINING S THAT'S A YET I THINK THAT'S FAIR I THINK YOU KNOW OF ALL THE SYSTEMS I THAT DECLINE WITH AGING NOT EVERY BRAIN SYSTEM DECLINES BUT CERTAINLY THE FRONTAL EXECUTIVE SINC SOME TALKIN ABOUT AS ONE THAT TAKES MORE OF A DECLINE THAN OTHERS THAT JUST HOW IT IS WITH WITH HEALTHTHY AGING IM NOT SURPRISING IT'S IT'S THE MOST COMPLICATED SYSTEM AND IT'S PRILY THE MOST BIOLOGICALLY COSTLY AND SO YOU KNOW THE MORE COMPLICATED SYSTEM IS IN A A TAKE MORE OF A HIT THATS THAN OTHER SYSTEMS AND SO CERTAINLY IM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT REGRESSING BUT CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT OR WE MAY BE ACCELERATING THIS THIS THIS A DECLINE THAT WE KNOW EXISTS AND BUT A WAY I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT THOUGH IS IS THAT NOT JUST AM TRYING TO PREVENT THE DECLINE BUT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFOR IT IS NO REASON NOT TO OPTIMIZE I NM IF IF EVERYTHING IS COUCHED AND I DON'T WANT TO GET TO MENTIAND DON'T WANT TO ET ALSIMER DISEASE AND I DON'T WANT TO GET THIS IN THAT I THINK THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE LOOKING ABOUT WE WANT TO LOOK ABOUT OPTIMIZING HEALTH AND AND ABRAIN HEALTH AND AND AND GETTING UP TO OUR OPTIMAL LEVELS A BECAUSE OTHERWISE BEUT ALWAYS PLAYIN DEFENCE INSTEAD OF PLAYING PLAYING OFFENCE ND THAT'S REALLY HARD FOR NAUROLOGIST WE WE HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING ABOUT BRAINED HEALTH EVEN THOUGH WE'RE THE BRAIN SPECIALISTS WE THINK ABOUT BRAIN DISEASE AND WE'RE JUST NOW AS I FEELS ARE THINKING ABOUT PREVENT TET ON NEUROLOGY WHICH S IN IN THINKING ABOUT IT NOT JUST LIKE STOPPING ALCIMER ISEASE BUT A PROMOTING HEALTHY HEALTH IN A HEALTHY BRAIN RALDUS YOU KNOW NRODISON TALK TO PATIENCE ABOUTS OR HEALTHY PATIENCE ABOUT BEING HEALTHIER I LOVE HOW CANDED YOU ARE ABOUT THE MEDICAL FECTN AND HOWN AND I LIKE TO THING TO CHANGING I KNOW SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE A ERE I THAT I FEEL IS JUST MY MY BIAS BUT I FEEL THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC STAR TO BECOMING MORE AWARE OF THE THINGS THEY MIGHT DO TO SUPPORT THEIR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH MAY BE THEY HAD MORE TIME ON THEIR HANDS BUT THINK THERE IS JUST MORE FORGING FOR INFORMATION AM I LOVE THE IDEA THAT THROUGH SIMPLE PRACTISEIS LIKE FORCING ONE'SELF TO READ A BOOK CHAPTER START TO FINISH WITHOUT LOOKING AT ONE'S PHONE UM EVEN IF IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG AS ONE WOULD LIKE U REDIRECTING ONE'S FOCUS WHEN FOCAS MOVES AWAY IS SO WAY OF KEEPING WORKING MEMORY IN  COGNITE FUNCTION ON LINE MAY BE EVEN STRENGTHENING IT AS YOU SAID OPTIMIZING IT AM YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THEY'RE SO MUCH EMPHASIS NOW ON PHYSICAL HEALTH WHICH I THINK IS GREAT SLEE THANKS TO MAT WALKER YOU KNOW IF YOU REALLY YOU DON'T BROUGHT THAT TORTU IN ON SLEEP UM AND NOW OTHERS LIKE MYSELF FOR  I REALLY YOU DON' TRYN TO AMPLIFY THE MESSAGE OF THE CRITICAL RULE OF SLEEP BUT ALSO YOMUST BEOPLE REALIZE THEY SHOULD NOT ME AT LEAST WALK UM AS YOUAV THE TEN THOUSAND STEPS THING IS NOT A BAD IDEA UM  GETTING SOME PART RAIE UP A FEW TIMES A WEEK OR MORE MAY BE DOING SOME RESISTANCE TRAINING A FEW TIMES OR WEEK OR MORE AND THEN AND NOT JUST FOR ATHLETES BUT FOR ELDERLY FOLKS MEN AND WOMEND YOU KNOW UM I FEEL LIKE WE NEED THE SAME FOR COGNITION FORMENT FOR A BRAIN FUNCTION AND HE'RE JUST ISN O STRUCTURE TO THAT NO ONE CAN SAY RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO DO A THREE CHAPTERS OF READING YOU KNOW FICTION PER WEEK OR A YOU GET A READA YOU D LEARN A FEW NEW VOCABULARY WORDS AND THN WRITE SENTENCES WITH THEM THATE  THEY DO IN SCHOOL BUT THEN WERE JUST YOU KNOW SET INTO THE GENERAL POPULATION AND RIGHT AND MUST BE BLEI THINK FREGRESS RIGHT YE I MAY NI I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM A WITH BRAIN HEALTH IS IS TRYING TO HAVE A MEASURE OF WHAT BRAIN HEALTH IS AND IT'S INTERINGS TO ME AGAIN AS A PHYSICIAN UM THINKING ABOUT IT FROM AN RALL TO STANDPOINT A WHEN YOU GO ITO YOUR FAMILY DOCTOR YOUR PRIMIN CARE PHYSICIAN EVERY YEAR FROM YOUR YEARLY PHYSICAL A THEY EXAMINE EVERY ORGAN IN YOUR BODY EXCEPT YOUR BRAIN YOUR LUNGS YOUR HEARTS UYOUR SKULTS A ME SKIN BUT WHAT WHAT DO THEY DO FOR YYOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND NO COGNE THERE'S NOT NON WORKING MEMORY TEY DONT MEASURE YOU YOUR BRAIN AT ALL AND AND IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THER WE HAVENT PROVIDE THE FIELD AS NOT PROVIDED THEM WITH A TEST OF OF A BRAIN HEALTH RIGHT AND SO PART OF THE PROMISE WE DON'T HAVE A MEASUREMENT THE BRAIN HEALTH I I'M INVOLVED AND IT'S SOMETHING ALLE THE BRAIN HEALTH PROJECT WHICH IS AT YOUTE DALLOUS UM WHICH IS THEIR GOAL IS A STUDY A TONROL A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPL IN A AND THEY'VE BEEN DEVELOPING AP BRAIN HEALTH INDECKS AND A THAT'S A COMPLICATED THING TO DO BUT I I REALLY BELIEVE THEIR AUGNT TO SON TO BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST COCTISION ITS COGNICIAN IT'S ITS SOCIAL IT'S IT'S LIFE STYLE LIKES SLEEP AN AND IT'S IT'S A WELL BEING YOUTHE BRAIN A BRAIN HEALTH INDEXIS CAN O COVER ALL OF THESE ASPECTS OF THEY'VE DEVELPE QUITE A INTERESTING A IMPORTANT INDEX WHICH WHICH CAN  WHICH JUST TRY TO CAPTURE ALL ASPECTS OF BRAIN HEALTH AND THEN CAN BE USED TO TRACK A RE YOU CONTRACT YOUR BRAIN HEALTH OVER TIME WITH INTERVENTIONS THAT THEY THEY DEVELOP SO WE WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE WE NEED THE FIRST ONCE WE DEVELOP A BRAIN HEALTH IN DECTS THAT THAT THEN THEN WE HAVE SOMETHING TO TO FOLLOW AND TO AND TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE IF IF IIF WE ARE OPTENIZING YOUR BRAIN AL OTHERWISE HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR WOU'RE OPTEMIZING YOUR YOUR BRAIN HEALTH YOU DOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S NOT ON YOU YOU DON'T KNOW I'M ALL THESE GAMES YOU GET ON IN THE WEB DON'T REALLY TELL YOU I'M SO WON'T WE DEVELOPE THAT AH THEN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CAN PROMOTE RAIN HEALTH WILL BE MEASURABLE AND I THINK IT WILL TAKE OFF THE WAY PHYSICAL FITNESS THAT PERHAPS YOU GET ENOUGH OF IT FROM YOUR WORK BUT GIVEN WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT BRAIN HEALTH AND APPROACHES TO BRAIN HEALTH WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO BESIDES SLEEP EXERCISE NUTRITION 'M IN TERMS OF 'M TRYING TO OPTOMIZE BRAIN FUNCTION I'M INDOYOU MAKE IT APPOINT TO READ FICTIOND YOU MAKE IT APPOINT TO LEARN NEW NEW SKILLS LIKE INSTRUMEN INS THINGS LIKE THAT AGAIN MAY BE YOUR PROFESSION IN YOUR AND YOUR PERSONAL LIFE KEEPS YOU BUSY ENOUGH THAT YO DON'T HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS I MAN FOR ME I'VE A GATHERING ORGANIZING AN DISSIMINATING THE INFORMATION FOR THE PODCAST FEELS LIKE THAT THAT THAT THE HEAVY LIFTING MENTAL WORK FOR ME BUT BUT I'M KEENLY AWARE OF BUT THE FACT THAT WERE I TO READ MORE FICTION OR I'M LEARNAN INSTRUMENT II MEAN EVERYONE ELSE AROUND ME WOULD SUFFER IF I LEARN AN INSTRUMENT BUT I'M THAT IT WIILL PROBABLY BENEFIT ME IN SOME REAL WAY AT WHAT OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO ORE AND THAT YOU I'M YOU THINK OUR KIND OF OCCESS POINTS THAT HOPEFULLY PEOPLE ALSO ENJOY YE KNOW I I IAGREE THAT I I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE A I BUSY CAREERING YOUR DOING MANY DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE TEACHING AND RESEARCH AND SEEING PATIENTS I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT I I'M MAXING OUT IN I'MOL AND I'M FULL MY EXACUTIVE FUNCTIONS BEING TESTED TO LIMIT BUT BE LIKE CAN ASKIYOU LIKE A PROFESSIONAL LATHLEAD OF THE MIND YE IN A WAY BUT THEN THEN YOU REALIZE THERS THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT YOU KOW THAT'S NOT EVERYTHING THERE THERE'S SO MANY OTHER ASPECTS A EVERYTHING EMANATES FROM THE BRAIN SO YO START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING IN MY MY LIFE IS IS A FATHER AND I HUSBAND WHAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING YON TERMS OF PROMOTING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH FRIENDS AND AND DOW WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING FOR SLEEP AND HEALTH THAT A SLEEP AND NUTRITION I'M AS FIN YOU BRING UP BOOKS I I THINK YOU NOT WENT PROLY TWENTY YEARS ERE I NEVER READ ANY NOM YOU MIANY FICTIONAL BOOK AND SAIT THIS THIS CAN'T BE GOOD FOR MY BRAIN AND THEN JUST CONSCIOUSLY STARTED YOU KNOW READING I READING AM BOOKS AND READING HIS AN MORE NON FICTION BOOKS AND JUST LISTENING TO BOOKS OR READING READING AR YES THE LIKE TO RED E ARYEVERS YE LIKE WHISE UNFORTUNATELY  WHEN I WAS UNDERGRADUATES YOU OF WITH PREMEN THAY DON'T LET TO TAKE ANY COURSES THAT ARE INTERESTING SO I NEVER LEARNED ANY HISTORY OR OR YOU K ALL THE BOOKS THAT I NEVER READ I START READING MY KIDS YOU KNOW INGLISH LUSE YOUR BOOKS THAT I NEVER OUT A CHANCE TO INSTORN READING HISTORY AND SO YE IALWAYS FELT JUST LEKE G JUST INCREASING NOT YOU JUST KNOWLEDGE WAS WAS ENOT YOU KNOW LIKE I SAI R BRANGE OF STORES IN FORMATION THAT'S ONE OF IT'S THIS COB SO THAT THAT'S OT TO BE USEFUL BUT BUT AGAIN IM ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT I DO BELIEVE HELP BRAIN HEALTH WWE NEED WE NEED SOME WAY TO METMEASURE IT I THINK I'M CERTAINLY IF YOU FEEL HEALTHY THT'S AN IMPORTANT THING F YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR HEALTHY PHYSICALLY ARE MENTALLY THAT'S THAT'S GOOD THAT'S A GOOD START BUT IF WE ACTUALLY HAD A WAY THI SOR OF TRACK AT THE WAY WE CAN TRACK YOU KNOW HEART DISEASE AND LONG DISEASE AND SKIN AND THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK THAT WOILD REALLY POST EVERYONE'S CONFIDENCE THAT THIS IS REALLY MAKING A MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THE BASIS OF TO DAY'S CONVERSATION I 'M GOING TO READ SOME FICTION A I READ A LOT OF NON FICTION U AND I ENJOYED I LISTEN TO SOME AUDIO BOOKS BUT I I JUST IT'S CRAZY TO ME BECAUSE I'M A NORROW SCIENTISTS BY TRAINING AND I UNDERSTAND NEUR OPLASTICITY AND I DO KNO A BIT ABOUT FITNESS AND THE KEY ROLL OF REMAINING ACTIVE CON USITER LOSE IT AND MAYBE IMPROVE IT RIGHT KIND OF  THAT WASN'T INTENDED TO RIME FOLKS UM ON A BEHAVIORS BUT CLEARLY BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU'VE TOLD US THAT IF WE DON'T EXERCISE THESE WORKING MEMORY ANOTHER CAHT CIRCUITS FOR COGNITION LIKE WHY SHOULD THEY STICK AROUND ANDAND I'M BEGINNING A THINK THAT CSOCIAL MEDIA IS ENTERTAINING AS IT IS AND I LEARN THERE AND I TEACH THERE BUT THAT IT'S NOT A COHESIVE UM PLOT RIHTS LIKE THOSE BABY AUTERS THAT REALLY COOL LOOKING DOG THAT I LOVE TO OWN I'M THINK ABI CAN ANOTHER DOG UM THIS INTERESTING CONFERENCE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S LIKE RANDOM SUDO RANDOM TAILOR TO ME OF COURSE AS THAT'S WHATH THEIR ALGARITHMS DO BUT BUT THAT'S NOT FOLLOWING A PLOT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT UM ANTAGONISTS PROTAGONISTS UM I ANY OF THETHELIKE THINGS THAT PROVIDE LIKE COGNIVE RICHNESS UM IS CONE OF OBVIOUS AS I AS I AY THIS BUT A I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DIVORCED FROM THESE THINGS THAT REALLY HELP IVOLVE CULTURE AND INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS AND AND IT TAKES SOME DISCIPLINE BUT LIKE OF RUN ORE GOING TO THE GEM YOU DO A FEW TIMES FOR SHORTER AMOUNT TIME WITH LESSON TENSES E PRETY SOON OUR UPT TO SPEED AND THERE'S ANOPPER THRESHOLD LET YO AN N BE A PRO YUAR NOT GOT EM CERAINLY I CAN BE ANANATALATE YOU KNOW PROFESSOR YOU KNOW SO I DON'T THINK I OBVIOUSLY BOOSTING EXICT FINTIONS CREDIBLY IMPORTAN  BUT I DON'T THINK ITS CAN HAPPEN JUST WHAT ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK IT'S KIN AND HE IT NEEDS YOUM AN INTERACTIOND I MEAN I I BELIEVE EXECT CONLEN SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN YOU KNOW SCHOOL AS ONE OF THE COURT YOU KNOW AS AS A COURSE UM ALL THIS SCHOOL MAGIMENTHORY THAT TALK ABOUT COULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL WIT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAVE A GRADUATE STUDENTS IM AND THEY HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO READ THE LITERATURE AND DESIG AN EXPERIMENT TAND CARRY OUT THE EXPERIMENT IH THERE'S NO TECNOLOGY THAT'S GIN I JUST BE ABLE TO TEACH HIM OUT TO DO THAT YOU'VE GOT IT INTERVENE SOMETIMES AND THEY STOP READING ALL THOSE PAPERS ARE AN NOT RELEVANT O K  OR YOU KNOW YOUR YOU'R YOU' PILOT IT THIS ENOUGH GET GOING IT'S IT'S THAT KIND OF WISDOM THAT THAT THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU GET OLDER THAT THAT THAT THAT ALLOWS THAT HAS TO BE I HAS TO BE ON TOP OF THE THE THE TECNOLOGY SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IM WE ALSO NEED EEDS TO BE DIRECTED SO WHETHER IT'S IN SCHOOL OR WHETHER IT'S IN A PATIENT I THINK THERE STILL NEEDS TO BE SO ON COACHING US YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT'S WHY LIFE COACHES HAV HAVE BEEN SOMETPEOPLE REALLY BENEFITED FROM LIFECOACHES BECAUSE SOE ONE JUST  IT SOUNDS OBVIOUS WHEN YOU TELL YOUR KIDS YOU KNOW JUST RIGHT YOU NOW JUST JUST DO IT THIS WAY YOU KNOW BREAK IT OP INTO LITTLE PIECES IT SEEMS SO OBVIOUS BUT TO THEM IT'S NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS AND THEY JUST NEED TO BE TOLD SOMETHING SIMPLE FOR IT TO MAKE A PIG DIFFERENCE AND IN SCHOOL WE WERE WE'RE BROUGHT ALONG STEP BY STEP AND THOUGH IS CONTACT SO WHITE WOULDN'T IT BE THE SAME AN ADULTHOOD M I'M REALIZING A SHPRITE LEARN HOW TO PLAY CHESS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GAME RIT CHET CHEST  YET  ANY ANY ONE ANS WORKING MEMORY Y GOT TO KEEPINFORMATION ON LINE HER THERE'S A BUNCH ELSE  THERE UM I THINK A BUT AS A TOOL TO IMPROVE COGNITION UM I WAS ALSOTHING THOUGH SOME PEOPLE OR YET MORE TOWARDS THE ARTS MY SISTER IS REALLY GREAT ABOUT UM IF SHE'S A THERAPIST AN IT IN SIRMISISCOBUT ALSO IM TAKES LIKE THEADER CLASSES AND SHE SAID YOU KNOWLIN IMPROVIS I FORCES YOU TO  KEEP ON YOUR TOES KEEP THE CONTACT THERE YOU'RE UP ON YOUR FEET LIKE IT YOU KNOW ANDIID WASN'T A THEATER KID I DID THE CREW I DID LIKE THE PULLING THE CURTAINS AND STUFF TO I WHON DID OTHER THINGS BUT BUT BUT THAT WHOLE BIS IS ABOUT UM BEING YOU N A LEARNING THE NOVEL RULE SET IN THE MOMENT YOU KNOW IMPROPH BY DEFINITION ABSOLUTELY I MEAN ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE THERE'S A GOAL AND YOU'VE GOT A BREAK IT DOWN IT A SUBGOALS AND YOU'VE GOT O DO IT SIMULTANEOUSLYIN YOU GOT O FILTHRORGH OUT DISTRACTIONS AND YOU KNOW YOU NOW FOR EXAMPLE MY MY KIDS GOT ME ONE OF THESE PIETS OF AN FOR FOR I CHRISTMAS AND YOU KNOW  YOUYTHINK IT'S EASY TO SER MAKES SOME PEETS AND THROAT IN THE OVEN AND DONE IT'S R I O MY THIRD TIME AND IT' STILL NOT EVEN ROUND I CANOI'LL GA  IT SONE'S GOOD  AN YET YOU'RE IN A SIN WIT GREAT FOO AS OF THE STANDERD IS REALLY HIGH UM ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A REFERENCE TO THE SHEESE BORD PEETS O BUT I WAN TO KEEP THE LINES A SHORT AS POSSIBLE CAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY TOO LONG UM MAY BOU WE COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OTHER UNFORTUNATELY COMMON DISEASE STATES UM PARKINSONS AND AL'SHIMERS LET'S START WITH ALSHIMERS I THINK UM FEW FEW THINGS UM I SCARE PEOPLE MORE THAN THE IDEA OF GETTING ALSHIMERS ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE AL'SHIMERS IN THEIR FAMILY FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS THE CUNATIC LINK WITH AL'SHIMERS IF ONE HAS A PARENT OR GRAND PARENT THAT GOT ALLSHIMERS IS THERE UNKNOWN UM INCREASE IN IN THEIR ONE'S RISK FOR GETTING ALSHMERS IT'S NOT THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD ITS OTHER DISEASES THERES DISEASE LIKE HUNTINGEAS WHERE IT'S A VERY STRONG LING THAT IF YOU HAVE A APPARENT YOU HAVE A VERY HIGH CHANCE OF GETTING IT BUT THERE'S SO MANY FACTORS THAT TA IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CASE THAT YOURE YOURE INCREASE YERISS OF OF GETTING IT THERE ARE FAMILIES WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE FAMILY WHERE JUST RUNS IN FAMILIES BUT A I TRY A TO A NOT SCARE MY PA PATIENTE CHILDREN INTO WORRYING THAT THAT THERE NOT SURTELY GOING TO GET ALSIMERS BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT STRAIGHT FORWARD AS I UNDERSTAND ALSEHIMERS IS IT THE NERGES GENDER OF DISORDER A IMPACS THE HIPPOCAMPUS AMONG OTHER STRUCTURES THERE'S BEEN SOME DEBATE IN RECENT YEARS AS TO WHETHER NOT THE WHOLE AMELOID HYPOTHESIS IS REAL OR NOT THERE'S A PUNSHA UNFORTUNATELY FALSE DATA ACCUSATIONS AND THAT WHOLE THING BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT A SLICE O HUMAN BRAIN FROM AN ALS A PATIENT THAT DIED WITH ALSHIMERS I MAYBE EVEN FROM ALSHIMESMERS THAT YOU SEE PLACKS AND TANGLES YOU SEE THESE AM SUBSELLER STRUCTURES AND BUILD UP AND THAT OUR BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF ALSHIMERS THATS IN THE TAXBOOKN THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF A IS STILL CORRECT RIGHT YES OKE BECAUSE THEY THINK O A COUPLE YEARS AGO IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY SOCIAL MEDIA SOMETIMES CAN WORK IS THAT YOU KNOW THE IDEA WAS THAT IT WAS ALL WRONG R I KNOW ALL WRONG AND INDEED SOMEBODY  SOMEBODY FUDGE DATA THEY MADE UP DAYAND THAND THAT'S TERRIBLE AM BUT ALSHEIMERS IS IN E NERGE GENER OF DISORDER INCLUDES THE HIPPOCAMPUS PLACKS AND TANGLES OR PRESENT IN THE NERONS THOSE ARE NOT GOOD FOR NERONS AS I UNDERSTAND SO WHAT'S THE CONTROVERSY LIKE AND AND WHY DON'T WE HAVE A TREATMENT FOR ALSEHIMERS YET I FEEL LIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE INCLUDING PARKINS ANDS LIKE THERE THERE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DO TO AT LEAST PUSH THE SYSTEM IN THE RIGHT WAY WHYS ALSEHEIMERS AN OTHER DIMENSIAS SO TRICKY YE I MAN IS VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE O THE NER DE GENERALSORS IS IT'S SO A SO MANY FACTORS THAT ARE PROBLING VOLED IN THE PATHPATHOLOGY THAT THERE'S NOT ONCE IU O ONE SINGLE A TRANSMITTER THEN PARKINS DISEASE ATS A DECREASE DOP MEAN AND SO ONE TRANSMITTER CAN MAKE A VERY BI DIFFERENCE AM EARLY ON AN ALSEHIMERS THAT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS LOW ASSIL COLING AN IN THE BRAINS AND IF ONLY APPROVE A TREATMEN FOR ALSIMER DISEASEIS E DRUG THAT BOOS ASSIL COLING TWHAT'S THE DRULYRE IS CALLED THE NAPASIL THERE IS A FEW OF EM THERE ANTICOLINESTRIS AND HIBITERS THAT BOOS ASILCOLING THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY YEARS OR MORE AND YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS WHEN YOU GIVE IT TO YOUR PATIENCE THEY DON'T SEE MUCH OF OF A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT THE PRIMARY DAPASITS OF THE REAL PROBLEM HAS BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT IS THE PRIMARY MECHANISM THAT'S LEADING TO THIS THTHE WIDE RANGE OF COGNA BEHAVORAL ISSUES AND AND AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AT LEAST ONE NOR TRANSMITTER THAT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE AND SO NOW THE PUSH HAS BEEN IS THER ONE IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE CAN DO CAN WE CAN WE BLOCK AMELOID WE BLOCKS SOMETHING IN THE PATHOLOGY AND AGAIN IT JUST HAS NOT BEEN I SUCCESSFUL IT IT'S VERY FRESHLYG BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS OVER PRIE THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO I SAW MY FIRST ALSAMERS PATIENCE AND I DON'T BELIEVE I SAY THAT MUCH DIFFERENT SO THEM NOW YOU KNOW EXCEPT THAT WE HAVE A LOT MORE THINGS WE CAN DO JUST ON THE SOCIAL SIDE OF THINGS BUT UNFORCENATLY FOR DROGS WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN REALLY TRANSFORM ENOUGH U BUT AGAIN THAT THAT'S I I THINK PART OF A IN BEING IN RAGAS IT SOUNDS VERY DEPRESSING BUT I THINK PART OF THE FAMILY WHAT THE FAMILY ISN'T ALWAYS LOOKING FOR CURE OF COURSE THAT'S THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE A CURE BUT I THINK THEM UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT TO EXPACT HAD TO HANDLE THE BEHAVIORS IS WHAT THEYE REALLY AFTER AT LEAST UNTIL WE FIND YOU KNOW A CURE PARKINSONS YOU MENTIONED IS A DEFICID IN DOPAM ENURGIC FUNCTION DO LARGELY TO U DEGENERATION OF DOPAM AN URGENT ERNS THERE THERE'S SOME SOME EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS RIGHT EL DOPA UM DID YOU KNOW THER THIS OVER THE COUNTER THE STUFF THAT SOLD THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE WHO DON'T HAVE PARKINSON I'M NOT SUGGESTING THEY TAKE IT UM CALLED MACUNA PRURINES IT'S THE VELVETY BEIN YE VE HEARD OF IT'S NINE OR NINE PRESENT ELDOP HOWEVER YET IT'S IN PRESENT AND LIKE SOME ENERGY DRINKS AND SUPPLEMENTS AND PEOPLE GO BY IT I'M NOT SUGGESTING THEY DO THAT I SHEULD TRIED IT UM BOY FEEL BEING REALLY DOPAMEN DOUBT DOES NOT TO ME DOESN'T FEEL THAT GOOD YOU AVE FELL CON AGITATED MY VISION GO YOU KNOW TWINKLE IT DID NOT FEEL LIKE A HIGH OF ANY KIND AND THEN I FELT LOUSY FOR COPLEOWERS AFTER IT WERE OFF YE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN REALLY GET IN ENOUGH FELDOPA TO GET ENOUGH INTO YOUR BRAIN THAT THAT HAPPENED EARLY NAROLOGY WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED WE COULDN'T GIVE OUR PATIENCE ENOUGH FELL DOPA WITHOUT THEM FEELING BAD BECAUSE IT'S ALL SO IM MATABOLIZE IN THE PERIPERY AND SO WASN'T TILL WE GOT' SYNIMET CAME ALONG WHICH IS HAS I DEBOCXIIS THE CARBOXIS INHIVERT AT BLOCK SORT OF THE THA THE BREAK DOWN OF DOING THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SORT TO GET ENOUGH DON'T MEAN INTO THE BRAINS I'M NOT SURE YET THAT SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IM  IT'S NOT GAN A PRYE GET THE LEVEL SUPPLY ENOUGH IN IN THE BRAIN SO PARKINSON'S PATIENTS ARE GIVEN AL DOPA UM OR BROMA CRIPTINE OR DROKES LIKE THAT GOING BACK TO ALLSHIMERS FOR A MOMENT I MEAN WHAT YOU TELL IT SOMEBODY WH HAS EARLY STAGE ALLITIME AS YOU JUST SAY LISTEN TRYIAND GET GOOD SLEE TRY AND KEEP PEOPLE AROUND YOU STAKE COGNIABLY ENGAGED TRY AND KEEP THOSE CIRCUITS GOING THROUGH BEHAVIOUAL INDUCING AROPLASTISITY BUT WERSCAN A WATCH THE THE THE UM STEEPNESS OF THE DECLINE IS THAT REI REALLY ALL WE'VE GOT THE ALL WE'VE GOT AT UCH YE IS TO HELP THEM UP WITH EVERYTHING THAT COMES UP ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AALOT THE PROBLEMS UM THE MEMORY PROBLEMS TEND TO BE SOMETHING THAT TA FAMILIES CAN HELP COMPENSATE FOR BUT IT BUT YOU DO GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T BE WITH SOMEONE FOR TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IT SAID THE REAL BURN OUT FOR FOR CAREGIVERS THE LOT OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT COME UP A PATIENCS GET KIND OF DELUSIONS AND AGITATED AND AND SOME OF THE AH MEDICATIONS THAT WE USE FOR OTHER CONDITIONS A OUR HELPFUL FOR FOR TREATING THAT BUT IT IT'S REALLY JUST A PURELY SYMPTEMATIC THERBE AND THE MORE SOCIALIZATION THAT PATIENCS GET THE TEN THEY TEND TO DO BETTER THERE WAS A STUDY BACK AT PANUAY BACK THAT IF HE SHOWED PATIENCE AM FAMILY MOVIS OR FAMILY ABUMS IT WAS A REAL K I WAS BETTER THAN ANY DRUG YOU COULD GIVE THEM TO SOR HELP THEIR BEHAVIOR SO THERE'S STILL THOSE MEMORIES OR IN THERE AND THEY WERE MAKING SOMETYPE OF CONTACT THAT WAS WAS HELPING THEM EMOTIONALLY THAT YOU COULDN'T TURN OFF WITH WITH TA DROGS I THINK THE MORE WE DO THINGS LIKE THAT THE THE MORE WILL BE HELPFUL FOR THEM ALLEASE IN IT A SYMPTEMATICALLY HOA I'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF VIDIOS AND ON SOCIAL MEDIO PEOPLE WITH ALSEIMERS WHO A LISTEN TO A PIECE OF MUSIC OR PEOPLE WITH PARKINSONS THAT HEARE A PIECE OF MUSIC AND THAT SEEMS TO A RESURRECT SOME AT LEAST EMOTION CONTAXT APPROPRIATE EMOTIONAL STATE WHAT HE COME BRINGS THE PERSON TO THE TO THE SURFACE UM AGAIN UM YE AGAVA TRAGIC SITUATION FOR ALSHEIMERS RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE IF EVER THERE WAS A CALL TO ARMS FOR THE NEUROLOGY COMMUNITY AND AM BAOTAC AND BEHAVIOUR ALL TAC WU BE FOR TO FOR FOR ALSHEIMERS FOR THE TREATMENTOF OLSHIMERS ABSOLUTELY I WILL NEVER ASK A GUEST TO UM COMMENT ON THE THE THE GOOD ARE BAD BEHAVIORS OF OTHER PEOPLE EXCEPT MY OWN UM BUT O THERE'S ING NO BELL PRIZE WINNING NEURO SCIENTIST AND I VISITED HIM UM HE'S 'T A BIGGEYSCOST SCHOOL A BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND DRING THE COURSE OF OUR ONE HOUR MEETING HE CONSUME NO FEWER THAN FOUR PIECES OF NICARET GUM AND I SAID GOT ASK WHAT'S THIS ABOUT BY THE WAY HE'S EXTREMELY SHARP STILL UM AND HE SAID OH YE YE YOU KNOW I USED TO BE A SMOKER BUT SMOKINGS REALLY BAD FOR BOUECAUSE YOU CAN GET LONG CANSR DIPPINGS BAD FOR YOU COULD YOU GET MOUTH CANCER BUT NICOTINE THESE ARE HIS WORDS BY THE WAY IT'S PROTECTIVE AGAINST PARKINSONS AND ALSHEIMERS AND IT KEEPS IN MY BRAIN SHARP SO YOU NICKERET ALL DAY LONG AND I THOUGHT OKE WELL HE'S NOT HE IS AN EMPTY ACTUALLY UM AND I THOUGHT  THAT'S INTERESTING AND I DIDN'T AN EPISODETO THIS POTCAST ON NICOTINE IT BY THE WAY CAN RAISE BLOOD PRESSUR IT'S CERTAINLY SMOKING BAPING DIPPING OUR SNOFFING NOT GOOD BAD DON'T DO IT BUT THERE IS SOME INTEREST IN THE USE OF NICOTIN AS A COGNIVE AND HANSER SO I'D LOVE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT UM AND I'D LOVE TO KNW YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIS STATEMENT ABOUT NICOTINE BEING A A POTENTIAL WAY TO STAVE OFF PARKINSONS AND ALSHEIMERS WITH THE CAVYACHT THAT HE JUST CONE IT THROUGH THAT OUT THERE IN THE SKYS A SORT OF KNOWN FOR JUST KIND OF THROWING STUFF OUT THERE EVERYNASSAN WHIL I HAVE A FEELING YOU KNOW WHO THIS PERSON MENS BUT UM IN ANY WEN WHAT GIVES YET WELE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT NICETINE SAVING OFF ANY NERGEN OF DISORDER UM BUT NICETIN WAS USE A AND IT WAS USED IN A NUMBER OF EARLY ALSIMERS STUDIES JUST BECAUSE OF ITS EFFECT ON ULT THE COLINERGI A SYSTEMS SO THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO THAT A THE COINERS XSYSTEM IS IS A IMPING O DISFUNCTIONAL AN ALSIMERIEASANT IN BOOSING THE COLONERGIC SYSTEM PROBABLY IS BENEFICIAL I MEAN PATIENCE THAT WOELD GIVE THE ATICOLONESSERS IN HIBITERS THERE ARE SOME FAMILIES THAT SAY YET HE JUST SEE SEES REMEMBERING MORE ANDHE JUST DOING BETTER SO THERE THERE I'VE SEEN POSITIVE UM THINGS TO IT A IT DOESN'T REALLY SLOW THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE THAT'S THE PROMITS THES JUST CARRIES OT EVEN THE WORSE SYMPTEMATICALLY IMPROVING THE SYMPTEMS IT AGAIN I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE BOTH ASILCOING AND SOMETHING ELSE I THINK WE DON'T KNOW SHOULD WE GIVE DOT MEAN WITH THI WITH THE NICETINE OR THE ASECOLING SHURE WE NORPE NOPFEN I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A COCKTAIL WHICH WHICH AGAIN FARMESUK A COMPANIES YOU KNOW HAVE NOT TRIED A COCKTAL OF NARMODULATORS FRALSIMES THEY'VE JUST TRIED HOUSEOF COLING SELLS A YOU SHOULD BE RUNNING FTIE NO DISRESPECT TO THE CURRENT UM PEOPLE IN CHARGE BY THE WAY BUT MAYME ASHAM AM UM BIG BELIEVER THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE INDIVIDUALS IN CHARGE OF LARGE ORGANIZATIONS THERE SHOULD BE PANELS ENTHERES SO MUCH TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY BUT THEY APPOINT INDIVIDUALS HE CAN'T GET IT RIGHT ANY TIME THERE'S WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON BY DEFINITION SOCRI COMMITTEE COMMITTEES UM ANYWAY ANOTHER EDITORIAL ARE THERE ANY SEX DIFFERENCES MAL FEMALE DIFFERENCES IN UM  SORT OF U THESE DOPAMING LEVELS WORKING MEMORY UM INJURIES CONCUSHIAN  THINGS THAT WOULD DIRECT PEOPLE TOWARD DIFFEREN ROUTS OF TREATMENT UM GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S MORE SUSCEPTIBILITY IN ONE CASE MAYBE LESS SUSCEPTIBILITY MAYBE CERTAIN ORR TRANSMITTERS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN UM IMPROVING SYMPTOMS AN IN MEN VER SU WOMEN DO YOU SEE THAT IN THE CLINIC YE THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION UM THERE WAS A EMILY JACOB SUITS OF PROFESSOR AT YOU SEE SANA BARBER NOW IN THE PSYCHOLOGE DAPARTMENT A WHEN SHE WAS A GRADISIN MY LAB STUDY THE ROLE OF ESSERGAN ON WORKING MEMORY AND DOBENERGIC FUNCTION AN WHICH HE BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION AT THE TIME AND WAS EMBARRASSING THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT THERE IS THE FRONTELOVES ARE FULL OF ESCERGAND RECEPTORS IRS FROLLY MORE ESTAN RECEPTORS IN THE FUNDELOVS THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BRAIN IN MEN AND WOMEN ESTERTON BOOSES DOTME SO YOU A HIGHER ESTERGAN LEVELS CORELATES WITH WITH INCREASE A DON'T ME A LEVILS AND AND THERE WASE SOME ANECDOTL EVIDENCE THAT IN POSTMEN OPAZIL WOMEN WOMEN WHO WERE PUT ON ESCERGAN THAT THE WORKING MEMORY IMPROVED AND THERE WAS A A KIND OF EVOLVING LINK BETWEEN ESTERGEN IN FRONT TE LOW FUNCTION AND SHE DOES IS AMAZING STUDY WHERE SHE STUDIED HEALTHY A BERKELY UNDERGRADUATES AT TWO POINTS AND TIME DURING THE MENTUAL CYCHLE WHEN ESTRON WAS THAT IS LOWEST AND WHAT WAS HIGHEST AND SHE ALSO AM SENATIKE THEM FOR THE SENTIME THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE KNOW IF THEY WERE SORT OF LOWER OR HIGHER ON THE DOTME LEVEL AND THEN PUT THEM IN THE SCANNER MEASURED FRONTAL OF FUNCTION AND AND SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A CLEAR THE FRONTAL OF FUNCTION WAS MODULATED BY WHERE THEY WERE IN THEIR ESTRAN PCSYCHE WHEN THEY WERE LOW ESTEROGEN THEY WERE LOW DOPMING AND IF THEY WERE LOWESTER AND AND LOW DOPING TO START THEY WERE REALLY HAD DECREASED FRONTALO FUNCTION AND DECREASE WORKING MEMORY ABILITY SO IT I FLUCTUATED A BASED ON THIS INTERACTION BETWEEN ESTITON AND DON'T MEAN SUGGESTING THAT YOU ARE NOT ON DON' MEANINS IMPORTANT BUT HORMON SIR CLEARLY IMPORTANT THAT AND THEY THEY WORK A SINCE SINC INERGESTICALLY SO YOU NAS FOR DEVELOPING THIS THIS COTAL AM WE CERTAINLY HAVE TO BRING HORMONS INTO THE A QUASION AND LEARN MORE ABOUT IT THERE JUST SO LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT AM HORMONS AND COGNITION YET ONE OF THE THEMES THATS COME OUT OF SOME THE EPISODES WE'VE DONE WITH EMDIES WHO SPECIALIZE IN ENDICREN HEALTH IS THAT FOR BOTH MEN AND FOR WOMEN AM OPTIMIZING ESTROGEN LEVELS IS REALLY IMPORTEDT FOR COGNITION AND VASCULAR FUNCTION I THINK PEOPLE MISTAKENLY HERE OKA TESTOSTERONE MEN YOU KNOW ESTROGEN WOMEN OBVIOUSLY BOTH HORMONES ARE PRESENT IN MEN AND WOMEN IN FACT I THINK U I KNOW THAT TESTOSTRON LEVELS AND WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN THEIR ESTROGEN LEVELS WHEN YOU LOOK THAT WHEN YOU TOVE AM A OUSE THE SAME UNITS OF MEASURE IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THEY STILL HAVE LOWER TESTOSTERONE ON AVERAGE THAN THE TYPICAL MAIL BUT THAT MEN WHOS ESTROGEN LEVELS ARE TOO LOW SUFFER COGNIVE DEFECTS AN VASULAR DEFECTS OL THIS IDEA THAT MORE TESTOSTERONE LOWER ESTEROGEN N IN MEN AS IS THE IS THE IDEAL RIGHT AND UM A IT JUST DOESN'T HOLD RIGHT DOESN'T HOLD THEM AND UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE DOMB AND HAVE A HARD ATTACK THER JUST JUSTIN AT JUST DOESN'T HOLD UM VERY INTERESTING DO WE KNOW ESTROGENS DOING THERE IS IT ITS ITS SPECIFICALLY RAISING DOPAMIN AH MIGHT WE DO'T HAVE TO GAT TO THE EN APTIC BIOLOGY YES SEXULALR INTERESTING AS YESACTUALLY BOOSTING ADOT MEAN ACTIVITY SO IT'S MAKING MORE DOPAMEAN AVAILABLE YE YE A IT'S IT'S REALLY A AMAZING AND AND AM AND TO THINK ABOUT IT SORT OF FLUCTUATING AM CERTAINLY DURING THE MENTUAL PCYCHLE WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF FLUCTUATES AN IN IGUALWMEN OVER THREE DAYS BUT THAN YOU CAN THINK A CROSS INDIVIDUALS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT HOW HOW MUCH IT CAN ACCOUNT FOR INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCE IS SO NOT ONLY SOR KNOWING YOUR DOT MEN LEVEL BUT I KNOWING SIR VESTRIAN AN A HSERTAINLANS REALLY AN TO BE IMPORTANT INTERESTING IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT PHYSICAL EXERCISE CAN IMPROVE WORKING MEMORY IN COGNITION SEPARATE FROM THE KNOWN IMPROVEMENTS IN CARTY OF ASCULAR FUNCTION AND BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN THAT OCCUR WITH EXERCISE LIKE AS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT GOING FOR YOU KNOW IF FORTY FIVE MINUTE BOWD OF EXERCISE AN PIC YUR FAVOREDEEXERCISE AND THEN DOING COGNIVE WORK IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD WHEN PRESUMABLY THE CATICOL MEANS DOPENING AR UP AN EFERAN AN EPER AN FERANER GN BE CIRCULATING AT LEAT IN THE BLOOD AT HIGHER LEVELS IS A IS ORY AS THAT STUFF EVER BEEN EXPLORT IIN ALL THE GROUPS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP KONKNR THERAPIES THEY THEY OFTEN USE EROBIC EXERCISE AS AS AS ANOTHER TYPE OF THERAPY AND AND THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE THE GROUP AT UNIVERSE ILLINOIS ACAMPAIN OUR CRAMERS GROUP AS YOUAN AROBIC EXERCISE QUITE A BIT AND THEY CAN FIND AT JUST AS EFFECT OF AS COGNAN THERAPYIN IPROVING EXECUTIVE FUNCTION JUST STRAIGHT UP NOW EROBIC EXERCISE WELL AND DOM AND SO YOU KNOW THE HARD PART IN THE REAL WORLD IS IS HAD YOU GET YOU KNW A SEVENY OR EIGHT YEAR OLD YOU KNOW DO THE KIND OF A ROBIX SAID BUT BUT NOW IT THE KNOW RECOMEENT BICYCLES AND NOW THERE HAS BEEN STUDIES WITH SEVEN YEAR OLS WITH JUST PUTTING HIM IN MOSTLY WITH OVERCOME BICYCLES AS SOR F DESIGNING WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THE DESIGN EXERCISE THAT CAN GET AROBICS UP BUT IT'S IT'S A AND YOU KNOW NORALJUST OR STARN'T I THINK YOU KNOW MY FEEL THE STARRING TO REALISE THAT THERE'S THERE'S WE GOT A TACKLE THIS AT ALL ALL EVERY WAY WE CAN AND SO NOW O'M HEARING YOU HEAR MORE NOROLTUS TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THIRTY YEARS AGO KNOW KNOW NROLIGER SAY YOU GAT EXERCISE MORE YOU KNOW OR JUST NOW IT'S ER TALKING ABOUT EXERCISE AN NUTRICION AND SLEEP AND AND  YOU IT'S ALL BECOMING SORT OF PART OF OUR PACKAGE IVE HARGAN HELP OUR PATIENCE BUT THE AROPICACISES AS SUIS SUPERINTERESTING AND AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KOW THAT THAT KIND OF MADE ME THINK THAT AM WHAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WAS MINDFULNESS AND SO WHEN WE AT LOT OF THESE STUDIES ALSO IF THEY HAD MINDFULNESS TRAINING TO THE CHARD CORK GO MANERGE BEEN TRAINING IT'S IT'S BETTER THAN THAN JUST THE THE EXECUTIVE TRAINING ALONE JUST LEARNING SKILLS TO STOP RELAX REFOCUS KIND OF GIVES THI SORT OF BOOST O TO EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AS WELL EI THINK OF MINDFULNESS LIKE T SORT OF UT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TRADITIONAL MEDITATION I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HERE BUT BUT THEY THE SORT OF STERATYPICAL MEDITATION OF CLOSING ONE EYES CLOSING ONE'S EYES EXCUSE ME SITTING DOWN LYING DOWN AND AND JUST FOCUSSING ON ONE'S BREATH AND THEN REDIRECTING ONE'S FOCUS TO MAY BE THIRD EC ENTER THE O AREA BETWEEN THE FOREHEAD JUST REDIRECTING FOCUS REDIRECT I THINK OF MEDITATION OF THAT SORT AS A FOCUS EXERCISE RIGHT IT'S IT'S NOT SO MUCH A PERCEPTIOAL EXERCISE BECAUSE THOUGHTS ARE KIND OF YOU DON'T DO IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING OM LIKE FOCUS EXERCISE AND THAT'S HALF OF THE PROBLEM WITH NOT ACHIEVING OUR GOALS RIGHT AS WE WE LOSE OUR FOCUS AND SO BUILDING INTO SORT OF STRATEGIES TO TO MAIN FOCUS A YOU NOW TO STOP AND  LACKS AN REFOCUS AS IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY AN FOR BOOSTING EXECUTIVE FUNCTION SO AND THAT AAND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER WHAT YOU KNOW I KNOW THIT'S ALTER FROM FLAVORS OF MINDFULNESS A WE JUST HAPPENED TO USE ON WHEN WE WERE STUDYING IT IT DOESN'T YET I DON'T THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD TELL ER THE MINDFULNESS BUT MOST FORMS OF MYFULNESS WILL WORK OF OF THE TYPE YOUR TALKING ABOUT THA'S SIMILAR WHAT I DESCRIBE TO SAMLAR TO WHAT YES EXT EXACTLY YE IT'S AMAZING TO ME YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS AGO IF SOMEBODY ONE TO TALK ABOUT NEROSINS IN MINDFULNESS ON A MAJOR UNIVERSY CAMPAS LET'S TAY STAMFORD OR A BERKLAR IS POBLYBL BIT HALLERAS IDEAS AT THAT TIME JUST GIVEN THE YE THE KIND OF CULTURE A THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN LAUGHED OUT OF THE ROOM BUT BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF SKEPTICISM AND I FEEL LIKE NOW MINDFULNESS MEDITATION BREATH WORK THE IDEA THAT YE MY GOODNESS BREATHING CAN IMPACT YOUR EMOTIONAL STATE YE I MEAN THAT SHOULDHAVE BEEN OBVIOUS  AND NOW THAT PEOPLE ARE ON BOARD THAT AND NOW OF COURSE THREIS A LOT OF INTERESTS IN PSYCHADELICS IS KIND OF A NEW EMERGING THERAPE CARYING MORE RISK POTENTIAL RISK BUT IT LOOKS LIKE ITS VERY LIKELY TO SOME OF THOSE WARE GING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE THE F T  FILL THERE'S AT SOME POINT BUT THE CONVERSATION WERE HAVING NOW Y NOR ALL YES O NOR BY ALL JUST TALKING ABOUT MINEFULNESS NUTRITIAN WERE TALKING FREELY ABOUT NICOTINE YOU KNOW WERE NOT SUGGESTING PEOPLE DO THAT BROMOR CRIPTINE AS I TO OPTIMIZED COGNA FUNCTION OF ME THIS CONVERSATION WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED AM SEVEN YEARS AGO NO IT JUST THE FIELD HAS CHANGED YET NOR I HERE NER ALAS TALKD ABOUT IT ALL THE TIMES TISO DO TRY MINDFULNESS AND IF YOU DO DOES IT MAKE YOUR D YOU FEEL LIKE YOU PERFORM BETTER THAT A  THINGS FOR ASKING NO FORMS OF YES THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES AM I THERE'S AS A VERY SPECIFIC PRACTICE THAT I'VE USE SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT'S REALLY BENEFIT IN ME SO MUCH WHICH IS AN WHAT I CALL IT NON SLEEP DEEP REAST BUT IT'S BASED ON A PRACTICE CALLED THE OGA NETRO WHERE YOU JUST LIE DOWN AND IT'S A THESE ARE FREE AUDIO SCRIPTS ON LINE WE CAN VIDLINGS TO THESE UM AND YOU GO THROUGH ABODY SCAN AND YOU DO SOME LONG ACAIL BREATHING WHICH EMPHASIZES THE PARI SYMPATHETIC  C RELAXING ASPECT OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT OM SAYING  FOR THE AUDIENCE A AND IT DOES INVOLVE SOME INTENTIONS AN THINGS LIKE THAT BUT IT CAN ALSO JUST BE A SELF DIRECTED RELAXATION AND I EMERGE FROM THAT WITH MUCH MORE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL VIGOR THAN I DID PRIOR AND THIS ONLY TAKES MAY BE TEN MINUTES THERE'S ALSO A THIRTY MINUTE SCRIPTS I DO THOSE AND THEN I DO A MINDFULNESS MEDITATION THE THING ABOUT MINDFULNESS MEDITATION THAT THE BIGGEST IMPACT FOR ME HAS BEEN THE PROBLEMS OF MY LIFE A GET RE A I GET A IFFERENT PERSPECTIVE I START THINKING ABOUT THINGS IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF TIME LIKE THIS THING THAT IS  LIKE A PROBLEM THAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR INSTANCE I MI STARTS THNK ING YOU KNOW LIKE IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFETIME THIS IS YOU KNO  RELATIVELY SMALL NOT SMALL THING BUT IN RELATIVELY SMALL TIME BEEN AND I SORT OF THINK ABOUT YOU BEST COURSE OF ACTION GIVEN IT'S REAL ROLE IN MY LIFE AND WHAT I WANT ET CETERA SO I FEEL LIKE ITS W OF ORNIENTS MET IN TIME U UM SO THAT'S BEEN A MAJOR EFFACT FOR FOCUS THE BEST TOOL I KNOWIS TO YOU PUT THE PHONE IN ANOTHER ROOM M NOT CONE OF I  DON'T UM AND I KNOW OUR FRIEND AD ECHANG NER SURGEON CHAIR OF NURSE OR GAT YOU SEE US AF HE'S BIG ON UNMINDFULNESS MEDITATION YOT DIT SO DO YOU MEDITATE NOW I THINK THAT'S ONE OTHER THINGS MOREWER TALKING ABOUT WHAT SHOUL WE DO BESIDES READING FICTION I THINK THAT THAT SHOUD BE ON MY LIST BECITHIN IS IS AS I YET NOW I GAS IS JUST AMAZING THAT I THAT H THE PATIENTS TELL ME ABOUT IT AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM OR OUR STUDIES UM YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS LIKE A AGAIN I WAS SAYING BEFORS IS IF WEE HAD SOME MEASURE OF A YOU KNOW BRAIN HELP THAT WE COULD SEE THE IMPACT OF IT WHAT SORT OF PUSH US TOWARDS DUR SINA PROLY DOING IT MORE I THINK ANOTHER THING THAT WE'D IN SORT OF TALKING ABOU WE TALKD A LITTL ABOUT WHAT DON'T MEAN AS ARE THERE OTHER KIND OF BRAIN STATES THAT SORT OF A YOU KNOW PREDICT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE GING TO RESPOND TO THESE THERAPES AND AND OW IF IF YOU'RE GOING O BENEFIT FROM EM AND AND A YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK WHAT SORT OF MEASURING SORT OF THE LARGE SCALE ORGANIZATION F THE BRAIN AND BRIN NET WORKS AND THAT SORT OF VERY POPULAR I DEAN IN NUR SCIENCE TO DAYSOR MOVING AWAY FROM SOR WHAT IS THIS WE'VE TAUGHT TO LOT BUT WHAT THE FRONT TO LOVES DO BUT THE FRONTO LOVES ARE PART OF THESE NETWORKS IN THE BRAIN AND AND A REALLY SORT OF YOURE THE STATE OF YOUR NETWORKS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FACTOR IS WELL IN ADDITION TO SORT OF YOUR YOUR DOTING YOUR SORT OF NEURMODUYI SORT O NOR CHEMICAL PROFILE YET TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS I MEAN UM YOU ACTUALLY A PREMP TED MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH AS CAN BE AND IT'S IS MY FAVORITE QUESTION ASKED CARLED DE US OR OFF TAUGHT ME TO ASKED THIS WAY BACK WHEN LIK WHAT REYOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT NOW CAS I KNOW THE WORK YOU'VE PUBLISHED AND ND WE'V AND YOU'VE DONE A MAGNIFICENT JOB OF SHARING THE DETAILS OF THAT AND AND WORK OF OTHERS UM IN A REALLY INFORMITIVE AND IN SOME CASES ACTIONABLE WAY BUT WHAT WHAT DARE YOU HAT YOU REALLY EXCITED ABOUT LIKE IF IF A THERE WE'RE NO FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO YOUR GRANTS AT CETERA YOU HAD A THOUSAND PEOPLE WORKIN WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE THING THAT'S HITTING YEAR DOPENING CIRCUITS THESE DAY WELL IN THE GRAND SCALE I'M EXCITED THAT THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS NOT JUST IN MY LABER YOUR LABER ANY ONE'S LAVE IS ACTUALLY NOW BEING TRANSLATED ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE I MEAN WHEN PEOPLE ASKED ME WHAT I DO I SAMINEUROLOGISTS BECAUSE THAT'S AT MY COR WHAT I FEEL I AM AND I FEEL I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS TO TO TE HELP PEOPLE AN SO IT'S IT'S WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WORK FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND IN A DOZEN TRANSLATED IT IT'S CAN BE FRUSTRATING BUT BUT NOW I'M EXCITED THAT I IT SEEMS THAT THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED THAT LFAS HAVE LEARNED AND NER SCIENCE O STARRINGTON NOW TRANSLATE INTO SOMEISN'T TO SOMETHING AND IN NERSE SCIENCE WHAT SORT OF WHAT'S HAPPENG LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE THINKING OF THE BRAIN AND IN A KIND OF GRANDEUR SCALE HIS SORT OF IT'S OVER ALL ORGANIZATION NOT SO FOCUS ON JUST THIS AREER THAT ARIA I'M ONE IT WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE FRONT TO LOVES IS BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART THE THE IN THE A CONDUCTOR YES I I I AM TALKING ABOUT ONE BRAIN REAGION BUT IT IT'S A BRAIN REGION LIKE I SAID THAT'S CONNECTED TO EVERYWHERE AND IT'S BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTED TO EVERYWHERE IS WHAT'S REALLY A THE ESSENCE OF WYITS IT'S SO IMPORTANT SO A SOME OF THE RECERS ON EXCITED MOST ABOUT A SORT TAKING AWAY THE NAMES OF AREAS AND JUST THINKING ABOUT THE BRAIN AS A AS A A BIG NETWORK LIKE AT ALIKE AN AIROLINE NETWORK OR OR ELECTRICAL NETWORK AND HOW HOW DIFFERENT AREAS COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND WHEN YOU THINK OF IT THAT WAY SO FOR EXAMPLE IN AIRLINE NETWORK A YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE HUBS ALL OVER THE WORLD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR EXAMPLE YOU'VE GOT CHICAGO IS IS IS A HUB AND EM AND THERE'S OTHER HUB MA WALKY OR SINCE A NATTY BUT THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN THE NETWORK AS A WHOLE RIGHT IF IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET FROM A NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAPPENED TO BE MANY TIMES EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT GOING THROUGH CHICAGO IF CHICAGOES SHUT DOWN YOUR PROLEGAN AGET DELAYED BECAUSE SU A AS IS HUGE INPACT ON THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW IF M WAKY GOES DOWN YOU KDOWN EVEN KNOW IT YULIRIHT OVERI'M SORRY IF ANYONE'S LISTENING FOR THEYR ELL U YOU'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH BUT BUT SO THINKING ABOUT THE BRAIN THE BRAIN IS THE SAME WAY THE BRAIN HAS THESE HUBS AS WELL AND AND YOU NOW THE PREFRONT AF QUARTEXS IS IS A HUB LIKE CHICAGO IT'S JUST AN IMPORTANT HUB THAT KEEPS THE WHOLE SYSTEM A OUYOUGOING AND THAT'S WHY IT HAS MUCH MORE OF AN INPACT WHEN YOU WHEN YOUAT YOU WHEN YOU DAMAGEIT OR YOU STRESSED AS SUPPOSE TO AN SOME OTHER PART OF THE BRAIN AND SO WHAT'S EXCITIN IN ME IS NOT ONLYS THAT MAKE US THINKING ABOUT DISEASE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE NOW OR STARN TO THINK ABOUT HOW IS DISEASES EFFECTING THESE HUBS THAT THE PATHOLOGY SEEMS TO BE LIKE A AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALSIMER'S DISEASE YOU LOOK ITS GETS A FRENDY AND YOU LOOK T A LOT OF DISEASES IT'S NOT JUST THAT IS SOME MICROSCOPIC CHANGE IN SOME NURON IT SEEMS TO BE EFFECTING HUBS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE AFFECTING THE WHOLE NETWORK AND SO WE HAVE A DIFFERENT TARGET TO GO AFTER FOR TREATMENTS WT WHAT CAN WE DO TO SORT OF BOOST YOU KNOW A HUB THAT'S BEEN DAMAGED I SUPPOSE TO THINKING ABOUT IN A IN A LESS PECIFIC WAY AND THEN ALSO AS WE'E AS WE'VE REALLY START TO LEARN ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN AS ORGANIZIN THESE NETWORKS WEVE VOUGE TO LEARN THAT MEASURING A YOURE NETWORK STRUCTURE IS VERY PREDICTIVE OF OF OF YOUR WELL BEING AND HOW YOUE RESPOND TO INTERVENTIONS SO THERE'S A METRIC CALLED MY GILARITY WHICH MEASURES A HOW ORGANIZE YOUR BRAIN NETWORKS ARE AND THE BRAIN IS MADE UP OF DIFFERENT MODULS A DIFFERENT NETWORKS AND THESE NET WORKS CAN EITHER BE VERY COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER ARE NOT SO COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER AND AND THE MORE SEGURGATED THEY ARE WE CALL THAT MORE MOTILARITY THER KIND OF SEPARATE ENTITIES THEIR THE MODULAR AND IT TURNS OUT WE CAN MEASURE THAT WITH THAT FROM RI WE CAN PUT SOE ONE IN O SCANNER WE CAN DO THIS RESTING A A FROM RI SCANNING AND THEN WE CAN MEASURE HOW MODULAR YOUR BRAIN AS RS AS MY BRAIN AND ALL OF US ARE VERY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF MODULARITY IS IT MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE MORE MODULARITY IS SUPPOSED TO LESS YET TURNS OUT THAT IT SEEMS TO BE MORE AVITATION HAVE MORE SO WE CAN PREDARE SEPARATENESS OF BRAIN YE UNCTION BETWEEN HEIRS YET THAT THE NETWORKS ARE SORT OF MORE INDEPENDENT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER BUT AT AT AT SOR BASE LINE THEI'R MORE INDEPRESTING STATE CONIC YET IF THER MORE THEIR MORE INDEPENDENT AS SUPPOSED TO A LESS INDEPENDENT WITH EACH OTHER NOT UNLIKE A NER MUSCULAR JUNCTIONS GAN DEVELOPMENT ARE WHAT WE CALL POLLY INERVATED THAT'S WHY BABIES CAN MOVE THEIR LIMBS BUT NOT WITH A LOT OF CORDINATION LOOK AT A ONE YOUR OLD TRUN EATS PEGETTY FOR INSTANCE HILARIAS I LOOK AT THAT SAME KID SEVEN MONTHS LATER THERE'S LOT MORE PRECISION O MOVEMENT LARGELY DUE TO REMOVAL MORE MODULARITY OF CONCONNECTIONS RIGHT RIGHT INTEREST SO WE WE DID A STUDY WHERE WE TOOK TWELVE TRAMATIC BRANGURY PATIENCE AND MEASURE THE MODULARITY SO YOU GET A NUMBER YOU ARE JUST GET A MODULARY INDEX FOR EACH OF THE TWELFTHS PEOPLE AND THEN THEY UNDERWENT THIS GOMAGEMEN TRAINING AND WE ARE ABLE TO PREDECT WHO WAS CAN IMPROVE ON THE TRAINING THAT THOSE WHO HAD MORE M STARTED OFF MORE MODULAR BENEFITED MORE FROM THE TRAINING AND IT'S TURND OUT THAT THIS HAS BEEN A VERY BUS FINDING ACROSS STUDIES NOW ACROSS DIFFERENT TRAINING A DIFFERENT YOUNG OLD PATIENT POPULATIONS IT'S ALSO PREDICTED THINGS LIKE A WHETHERE'S SOME ONE IN A COMAIS MORE LIKELY TO DO WELL OR SOMEONE WHOSE OLDERS CAN TO HAVE A CERTAIN MOUNT OF COGNAN TO CLINE OR SOME ONES WE RESPOND TO BEHARL THERPY IF THEIR OPSESSIV COMPULSIVES SOF THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BRAIN STATE THAT NOT ONLY CAN MEASURE BUT ACTUALLY IS GIVING US INSIDE IN TO THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE'RE DOING WHICH AGAIN IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE HELPFUL AND DETERMINING WHAT HELPS AND WHAT DOESN'T HELP IF WE KNOW AWE NOW IR WHAT THE STATE IS BEFORE WE START THE INTERVENTION SO INTERESTING AND A MAKES ME THINKMANY THINGS BUT AO JUST FOCUS ON TWO OF THEM ONE IS I LOVE THIS IDEA THAT YOU AND OTHERS ARESTARTING TO LOOK AT BRING NETWORK ACTIVITY AS SUPPOSED TO OVER EMPHASIZING THE ROLL OF SAY PREFRUNTAL QUARTACS OR HIPPOCAMPUS UNDERSTANDING MORE THAT THOSE ARE HUBS IN A LARGER THEME OF AM OF ACTIVATION BECAUSE YOU NO FIGHT ONE WISH FOR SCIENCE COMMUNICATION ITS THAT PEOPLE WOULD YES LEARN SOME TERMS LIKE DOPOMING IN FRONT TO LOAVES IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOW THE NOMAN CLATURE BUT 'S UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT'S BENEFICIAL YOU NED TO THING ABOUT VERBS NOT NOWNS RIGHT IT'S ABOUT THE ACTION SATES OF THESE ERIAS AND THOSE ACTION STATES ARE ALWAYS A INVOLVING MULTIPLARIAS YET JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T TOK ABOUT RUNNING AS JUST LIKE QUADRUSEP IN HAMSTRING FLECTION AND EX STENSION AND YOU KNOWN CONTRACTION IS  IS AS A YOU CAN YOU CAN BREAK IT DOWN THAT WAY AND THEN'S USEFUL TO KNOW THAT BUT ULTIMATELY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GAIT AND STRIDE AND THINGS THAT THAT HAVE A REAL VERB ACTION TO THE MAND WE HAVEN'T HAD SO MUCH OF THAT FOR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I AT IT AT A CIRCIT LEVEL WE BEN ABLE TO DO THAT FOR INDIVIDUAL NONS THAT'S THE FIRST PIECE AND THEN AM THE SECOND PIECE IS THAT YOU KNOW IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THERE'S SO MUCH RICH UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENT STATES OF SLEEP YOU MAT WALKER IS JUST HERE RECORDING THI SERIES ON SLEEP THAT WILL RELEASE SLATEOR THIS YEAR AND MYSTAGES ONE TWO THREE FOUR DEEP SLEEP SLOW WAVE SLEEP RAP AND I MOVEMENT SLEEP BUT WE DON'T EVEN REALLY HAVE A NAMING AM SYSTEM FOR WAKING STATES LIKE WE SAY FOCUS WE SAY TASKS SWHICHING BUT THOSE ARE AM JUST NAMES WE MADE UP A JUST AS STAGE ONE TWO THREE AND REM SLEEPER NAMES THAT WE MADE UP BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A A MUCH RICHER UNDERSTANDING LIKE WHAT RAPID EYED MOVEMENT SLEEP IS GOOD FOR AND WHAT DEFISIS IN RAPINI MOVEMENT SLEEP LEAD TO THEN THERE IS FOR INSTANCE HOW A GIVEN OUR NETWORK J OMEN TO MAKE THIS UP LIKE CALLING US CERTAIN NETWORK ACTIVATION STATE LIKE STATE A LIKE WHAT WE WE THAT IF YOU LIKE NORRO SCIENCES TASK IN A FEELD OF N SIENCE NOW AS TASKS WITH WITH GIVING US A UNDERSTANDING OF THE VERB STATES AND LIKE WHAT LIKE THESE WAKING STATES OF MIND ARE VERY MYSTERIOUS AN AND FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE PEOPLE WONDER LIKE IS MY FOCUS POOR OR IS IT IS A GOOD IS MY TASKS WICHING ABILITY GOOD AND WE ONLY TEND TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW IT ARE THEY FUNCTIONAL ENOUGH TO DO THEIR JOB AND MANAGE THEIR FAMILY MANAGE THEIR LIVES WE DON'T REALLY HAVE METRICS BUT FOR SLEEP WE HAVE METRICS AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS CAN MEASURE THAT YOU'L SLEEP TRACKOR RINGS RISTBANDS MATTRISS COVERS THAT ME THE SORT OF THING WELL YOU KNOW YEI I THINK MYTULARITY CAN ACTUALLY BE THAT METRIC SOME METRIC OF OF YOUR LARGE SCALE ORGANIZATION OF YOUR OF YOUR BRIN CAN BE THAT METRIC WE WEE THERE'S A NUMBER OF LAGHS THAT HAVE DONE THIS OF HAVE MEASURED MYGULARITY AND REAL TIME SO WHAT I WAS STALKING ABOUT WHICH JUS GETTING A SNAPS OUT OF THIS IS WHAT YOUR BASELINE MYGILARITY IS BUT WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT MAGALL I HAVE CHANGES ON A SECOND TA SECOND TE MINUTE TE MINUTE BASIS AND A ONE OF MY FORMEPOSAC EPT TAT A SOTAGAN  SHE JUST AT A VERY SIMPLE EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY WERE NOISES THERE WERE SOUNDS AND THE THE FUNCTIONAL MYSCANIS VERY LOUD SO YOU YOU CAN'T HEAR VERY WELL BUT EVERY ONCE A WHILE THERE BE SOUND WAS JUST ABOVE THE THE THE LEVEL OF THE NOISE OF THE THE SCANNER AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO A SORT OF A OU ON'T PRESS I BONE IF YOU HARD THAT SOUND AND YOU DIDN'T PICK IT UP ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW YOU MAYBE AIBY PESEND HE TIME YOU HEARD AND SOMETIMES TWENTY PERSOND TIMES YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT WELL SHE MEASURED THEIR MOULARITY AT A MOMENT TA MOMENT BASIS AND SHE COULD PREDICT IF THEY WERE GOING TO GET THAT IF THEY WERE GINTO BE CORRECT OR NOT IN RECK AND AND BREAK THE SOUND BEFORE THEY THEY GOT THE SOUND IF THEY WERE HIGHLY MODULOR WHOM THEY THEY THEY GOT IT IF THEI'RE BRAIN HAD GOT INTO THIS KIND OF YOU NON'T DIFFUSE LESS MIE STATE THET THEY MISSED IT AND SO I COULD DEFINIALY SEE AS YOU'R TALKING ABOUT WHEREIF WE CAN DEVELOP A MOGULARITY MATRIC IN REAL TIME ON A DEVICE A THIS WOULD BE GAME CHANGER AND SO AN THAT SORT OF WHAT I'M WEOU KNOW WHAT IVE BEEN INTERESTED IN DO WHAT'S EXCITES ME IS THAT WERE NOT GONG TO DO WITH A SCANT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T WALK AROUND WIT A SCANNER IN YOUR HEAD RIGHT AND AND EVEN I DON'T THINK YOU EVEN DO WITH THE G I THINK CAN WE DEVELOP A PROXY FOR MOGULARITY WITH SOME MORE SIMPLE WAY OF DOING IT CAN WE EXTRACT THIS MAY BE AT OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY OR FOR OXYGEN A I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN WORKING A WIT A SOME COLLEGUES THE O FORMER STUDENTA A BRIAN MILLER AND A A POSTOC OF ADAM GAZALIES A WEST CLAP WHO HAVE A COMPANY CALL NOR SCOUTING WERE THEY ARE ABLE TO A THEY HAVE WWEVE BEEN SOR DOING SCANNING AND ALSO OLECTING PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA TO DETRY AND DETERMINE IF THERE'S SOME PROT WE CAN MEASURE THE MODULARE IN SCANNER BUT CAN WE PICK THAT UP IN THE IN THE PHYSIOLOGY DID I BECAUSE THEY CAN COLLECT YOU KNOW OXYGEN AND HEART RAED VARIABILITY AND AN OTHER METRICS THAT BAY BE KIND OF A READ OUT OF THAT AND THEN THN WE'D HAVE A BRAIN STATE WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING IN AS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME BRAINSTATE BUT IT'S NOT I THINK PEOPLE ARE THINKING WERE GETING WE NEED A HELMET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE NEED JUST SOMETHING SIMPLE RIGHT THAT READS OUT BRAINSTEY JUST THE WAY WE READ OUT OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL A INFORMATION FROM OUR R WATCH OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WILL THE SLEEP TRACKERS OF VARIOUS KINDS HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN ABLE TO PULL OUT INFORMATION ABOUT RABON I MOVEMENT AND OTHER STAGES OF SLEEP IN MIN KEEN MATTRICKS NOT EVERY METRIC  NOT WHAT YOU WOULD GET WITH PERSON WEARING IT E G A YOU KNOW PROBE OR SOMETHING A YOU A SET OF PROBES BUT CERTAINLY INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED A ONE THING THAT HAS ME A LITTLE BIT PERPLEXED A AND A I'M ALMOST RELUCTANT TO BRING IT UP EN OMIN TO DO IT A IS THAT I DID A COUPLE EPISODES ABOUT SYLICIBON AND THE USE OF AM SOCIDON FOR THE A TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION THIS IS ROBING CARDAR HARRIS FROM YOU SEE US AF AND I ALSO JUS SOLO EPISODE EMPHASIZING A COURSEIS IS IN RECREATIONAL USE FOR TALKING ABOUT RTING MUT FOR TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION BUT THERE IS THRE'S A LOT OF NER IMAGING ABOUT AM AF PATIENCE BEFORE AND AFTER SA MACERODO SOLICIDE IN THIS ISN'T MYCRODOSING AND ONE OF THE MAJOR TAKE AWAYS IS A INCREASED RESTING STATE CONACTIVITY WHICH BY VIRTUE OF WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE MIGHT NOT BE IDEAL FOR COGNANT FUNCTION MIGHT BE GOOD FOR A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND I'M CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO DISPERAGE THE BEAUTIFUL WORK THAT'S BEING DONE THERE BUT YOU SAID THAT INCREASED MODULARITY PREDICTED IMPROVED FUNCTION ESPECIALLY WITH COGNIVE INTERVENTIONS A SOCIBON SEEMS TO A INDUCE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT IN INCREASES IN CROSSMOD OL TALK BE IN BRAINNEWERS YOUIN OTHER WORDS LESS MODULARITY SO U SHOALL WE BE CONCERNED O IT IS JUST IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE A MAKE THESE MEASUREMENTS AND AND CONNECTIVITY DOES'N MEAN THE SAME YOU ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONECTIVITY UM AND SO I LIKE TO WHEN I THINK ABOUT CONNECTIVITY WE TALKI ABOUT THIS CONNECTED IT IS OF OF BRAIN STATE AND AVERSES A BRAIN TRAITE SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU BEING HIGHLY MODULAR AS A TRAIT AH THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOUR MODULARITY IS LIKE INDIFFERENT STATES IT IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT YOU DO WHEN YOU DO THESE HIGHLY EXECUTIVE DEMANDING TASS YOU GET LESS MOT YOU GETS LESS MODLAR BECAUS YOU HAVE YOUR NETWORKS ARE COMMUNICATING IS WITH EACH OTHER SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE O FOR NET WORKS TO GET LESS MODULAR WHEN IT'S A MORE DEBANDING TASK BUT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THEN THEN WHETHER WHAT'S YOUR YOU KNOW WHAT'S YOUR BASE LINE MODULARITY BECAUSE IT'S YOU GOT TO GET FROM YOUR YOUR YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR BASELINE IS TO THIS OTHER STATE AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO US LIKE GOING FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER NOT NOT SO MUCH SORE THE ABSOLUTE SORT OF DIFFERENT SAYS SO THAT'S FAS JSESTHING I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE RESULTS BUTS INTERESTING THAT A THAT IT DOES A FACT SIR CONNECTIVITY IN THAT WAY I THINK THE DRUGS OUT AR GOING TO BE HELPFUL AR GAN A ARGAN A PROMOTE SORT OF TAT WORKS TALKING TO EACH OTHER AS OPPOSE O NETWORKS NOT COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER IN YOUR CLINIC DO YOU EVER COMBINE DRUG THERABESE COGNE OF TRAINING AND THINGS LIKE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION DO YOU USE STIMULATORS YES SO I THINK UM YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCE THAT HAVE REFERRED FOR A FOR IT'S APPROVED YUSE WHICH IS DEPRESSIONS I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT SORT OF THE THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE WITH IT AS A AS A FOR DEPRESSION BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD ANY IMPROVE O ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN FOR UM YOU DON'T FOR COGNITION SO THER DER BUNCH OF STUDIES AND DO SMALL STUDIES WHERE YOU CAN GIVE TRANSGRAING MAX CONVENTON T FRONTAL QUARTIXON WORKING MEMORY IMPROVE BUT THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN DONE IN WAYS ITER WE DON'T KNOW IF IT GENERALIZEIS IF IT'S IF IT'S GOING TO BE HOW YOU KNOW THE WAY IT'S BEEN DONE IN DEPRESSION IN A WAY THAT CAN REALLY BE BUT I BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DOING IT I THINK IT WILL BE PART OF THE THINGS WE DO DRUGS TO YEM AS UM AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE TALK ABOUT IS NOT JUST GOING TO BE ONE ONE THING ANY ENY GETS BACK TO NETWORKS RIGHT WHAT THIS IS DOING IS REALLY CHANGING HOW NOWS YOU KNOW THE H INTERACTION A REGIONS IS NOT ABOUT SOR OF JUS INCREASING O DECREASING ACTIVITY IN SOM MYSTERIOUS PART OF THE BRAIN IS THIS SOR RESTORING THE BALANCE OF A OF OF A NETWORK WE MARK I REALLY WONT TO THANK YOU YOU UM YOU CAN GIVEN US AN AMAZING TOUR OF A PRESILY FIVE FEELD IREA LOT AVE YOU UM YOU KNOW AS A NEUROLOGIST BUT THE WAY I'M I  SLIGHTLY RELUCTANT DO THIS BUT AM AMANATILL YOU JOKE UM TAT WAS TOLD TO ME UM A SO THAT THE'RE THESE PEOPLE STRANDED ON AN ISLAND AN DUM THERE THEY'RE REALLY STOCK AND THE'RE RUNNING OUT A RESOURCES AND DUM BY THE AY THIS JOKE WAS TOLD TO ME BY A PHYSICIAN AND ALL A SUDDEN THIS HOT AIR BALLOON AND COMES OVER AND THE LIKE ONLY GOINGTO SAY THEY TART THEY WRITE HELP IN THE SAND AND THEY YOU KNOW AND DUM HOT AIR BALLOON DIRECTLY OVER THEM CAM DESCENDS ALMOST YOU KNOW ALMOST TO THEM AND DUM AND THEN SOME ONE IN THE HOT AIR BALLOON SAYS YOU KNOW I'M DOING THE MEASUREMENT AND IT'S EXACTLY SEVENTY SIX FEET DOWN TO THOSE PEOPLE AND THEN THE HOT AIR BALLOON TAKES OFF AND GOES AWAY AND THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH ONE OF WHOM'S O PHYSICION IN EOS THOSE WERE NAUROLOGIS I TELL THAT J BECAUSE THAT WAS THE OLD SCHOOL VIEW OF NAUROLOGY THAT AM NEURALOGIST WERE GREAT T DESCRIBING THINGS TALKING ABOUT THE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS THEY COULD OBSERVE IN GREAT DETAIL BUT THAT THEY A DID NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT YOU ON THE OTHER HAND AND I'M GUSSING OTHERS IN THE FIELD BUT CERTAINLY YOU HAVE PROVEN TO DAY THAT YE THAT JOKE NEEDS TO BE REVISE WHEREBY THEREIS ONE AT LEAST ONE NAUROLOGOS WHO CASTLE LYING DOWN AND AND SHIMMES DOWN AND ASSIST THEM AND AN PULLS A THOSE A STRANDED A PEOPLE ON ON THE ISLAND UP TO THE A THE BALLOON BECAUSE A TO DAY YOU'VE DESCRIBED THE THE UNDERLYING NATURE OF SOME OF THESE THINGS LIKE WORKING MEMORY DEVICITS TROMOUT A BRAIN INTRY CONCUSHION ALTIMERS PARKINSINCS AGAIN I THREW A LOT AT YOU AND YOU YOU RESPONDED IT WOULD IN EN THROW CLEAR DETAIL BUT ALSO A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THAT CLEARLY CAN ASSIST IN THESE IN THESE UM IN THESE SITUATIONS SUCH AS FROMA CRIPTINE MINDFULNESS EXERCISE AND AND REALLY AS IT AS AN EXPLORATION OF OF WHAT CAN BE DONE INTERVENTIONS AND SO AM FOR ALL THOSE REASONS AND FOR TOLERATING THIS TERRING A JOKE THAT I JUST TOLD AM I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU BECAUSE AM I'VE LEARNED TO TON AND I KNOW THE AUDIENCE HAS LEARNED TO TON AND MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED HAS US AM LOOKING IN THE DIRECTIONS OF A POSSIBILITY TO TO ALLEVIATE THESE SITUATIONS AND AND AS YOU POINT OUT FOR THE ALREADY HEALTHY EVEN TO OPTIMIZED BRAIN FUNCTION AND HEALTH SO FOR ALL OF THAT THANKS FOR A SLIDING DOWN THE ROPE TO THE TO THE ISLAND WI SAY ON BE HALF OF ALL THE NARALGS IN THE WOR I'LL THANK YOU REPRECING OUT WHAT WE DO IT'S JUST IT'S JUST SO IMPORTANT TO TRY AND GET THIS MESSAGE AR PART I LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW WITH PATIENTS WE JUST TRY TO HAVE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND I THINK TO DAY PATIENTS AFTER REALLY BE ADVOCATES FOR THEMSELVES AND SO I THINK THE MORE THEY LEARN ABOUT ALL OF THESE POSSIBILITIES THE MORE THEY CAN GO BACK TO THEIR THEIR DOCTORS OR WHOEVER TRYING AND ASK FOR YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT THIS WHAT ABOUT THAT IS DOYOU THINK THIS WOULD HELP ME BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE ADVOCATES FOR OR HEL THEND AND THE ONLY MY WORGAN NI DO THAT IS MA PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THE POSSIBILITIES ARE SOTHANK YOU IS LOT LOT OF FUN GREAT TI AMENTALL THAT AN NOW OULD HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN THANK SO MUCH IG THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME FOR TODAYS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BRAIN MECHANISMS OF COGNITION AND MEMORY AND HOW TO OPTIMIZE

THEM FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS THAT'S WY MY BOOK GOO NETWOK OF PLINICS A SO SUCCESSFUL THIS BOOK IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S EVER GIVEN ME A SHRED OF HOPEFULNESS ABOUT STOPPING SMOKING LIKE IT LITERALLY ALWAYS FELT IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PAST AND OW HERE IS THESGUY SAYING THAT NOT ONLY WOULD I BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT ACTUALLY BE HAPPY ABOUT IT THAT'S THE TRUE MEASURE OF SUCCESS ALAN CAR SAYS NOT JUST STOPPING BUT BECOMING A HAPPY NON SMOKER COULDN'T IMAGIN BEING HAPPY NOT SMOKING I COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT A BUNCH OF WORDS COULD GET SOME ONE TO STOP FEELING AND INCREDIBLY STRONG URGE THAT WORDS ALONE COULD MAKE SOMETHING THAT SEEM SO IMPOSSIBLE LICTUALLY HAPPEN WHAT TYPE OF WHICHERY WAS AFOOT HERE IN THIS BOOK AND ALL THE STORIES IN TO DAYS SHOW ER ABOUT THAT PEOPLE KIND OF CASTING SPELLS TO TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE COMPLETELY CHANGE THEIR DIRECTIONS IN LIFE IN SOME WAY O AND YOU GET TO LISTEN TO ME TRY TO QUIT SMOKING STAY WITH US ACT ONE THE STRAW THAT BROKE JOK CAMELS BACK RACON NOT SURE ABOUT THAT TUTTLE THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHERS HERE THAT WE LIKE ACT ONE CAN I STILL BE A JOKER AND A MIDNIGHT TOKER WER IS WHEN ACT ONE THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTER LESSNESS OF BEING ANYWAY THE BOOK IS RELATIVELY SHORT AND REALLY REALLY REPETTED IT HE SAYS YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW EVERY INSTRUCTION TO THE LETTER AND THE WY IT WORKS CAR SAYS MOST PEOPLE WHO TRY TO CONVINCE YOU NOT TO SMOKE WILL TELL YOU THE REASONS YOU SHOULD ENT HOWTH RISKS ALL THE MONEY YOU SPEND WHATEVER BUT HE SAYS SMOKERS ALREADY KNOW ALL OF THAT IF ANY OF THAT ACTUALLY WORKED ALANCAR SAYS YOU'D O QUIT BY NOW NOW WHUT HE DOESN'T STEAD IS THE OPPOSITE HE NAMES ALL OF THE REASONS YOU GIVE FOR SMOKING ALL THE THINGS YOU LIKE ABOUT IT OR THINK IT'S OFFERING YOU AND HE CAREFULLY EXPLAINS WHY EVERY ONE OF THOSE REASONS IS BOKUS HE DESCRIBES IT AS A KIND OF DEPROGRAMMING ALTIMATELY REMOVING ANY DESIRE FOR A CIGARETT AND A LOT OF THE PRECEPTS MAKE A LOT OF SENSE FOR INSTANCE HE SAYS SMOKERS BELIVE THAT SMOKING HELPS THEM FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE BUT HE SAYS THE'RE JUST KITTING THEMSELVES THAT'S JUST AN ILLUSION ALL SMOKING DOES IS REMOVE THE DISTRACTION OF NIKOTINE WITHDRAW SO YOU ONLY THINK IT'S HELPING YOU THINK BETTER THERE TINDS OF FALLACIES LIKE THAT HE SAYS AND SMOKERS PERPETUATE THEM WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT IS IS FO  BROOK SAYS SMOKERS CLAIM THAT THE CIGARETTE RELAXES THEM AND HELPS THEM TO HANDLE STRUSSFUL SITUATIONS BUT THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT IT HELPS THEM GET GOING IN THE MORNING AND THAT IT GIVES THEM A BOOST HOW CAN A DRUG THAT RELAXES YOU OR RELIEVE STRESS ALSO STIMULATE YOU THIS CONTRADICTION ILLUSTRATES THE TRUTH ABOUT SMOKING THE CIGARETTE JUST DOESN'T DO ANY OF THE THINGS WE TELL OUR SELFS AT DOS I SHOULD SAY HE DISTINGUISHS EASY WAY FROM JUST GOING HOLD TURKEY OR WHAT HE CALLS THE WILL POWER METHOT THOSE POOR SOULS AREN'T REAL NON SMOTKERS HE SAYS TERE JUS SMOKERS WHO AREN'T LETTING THEMSELF SMOKE WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS THAT WHEREAS IF YOU HAVE NO DESIRE TO SMOKE ANY MORE YOU DON'T NEED WILL POWER YOU ALSO WON'T BE IRRITABLE WERE DEPRESS OR GAIN WAIT WORE ANY OF THE THINGS THAT ACCORDING TO MOST PEOPLE MAKE QUITTING HARD ALSO THE REPORTEDS ACCESSERATE FOR WILL POWER ALONE IS REALLY LOW IT DEPENDS ON DO YOU ASK BUT IT MIGHT BE AS LOW AS THREE TO FIVE PER CENT CUTTING DOWN DOESN'T WORK ALANCAR SAYS CAUS IT JUST MAKES EVERY CIGARETTE SEEM THAT MUCH MORE PRECIOUS IT'SWHY SAYS TO JUST SMOK AS YOU NORMALLY WOULD WHILE YOU READ THE BOOK ALSO YOU REALLY WANTS YOU TO SIT WITH IT HOW'S THE TASTE WHAT'S IT REALLY FEEL LIKE GOING DOWN INTO YOUR LUNGS AND DON'T EVEN GET HIM STARTED ON NICKOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY PATCH IS THE GUM ALL THAT STEFF THATS IS GING TO KEEP YOU WANTING CIGARETTES HE GET INTO ARGUMENTS ON THIS POINT LIKE THIS ONE ON SKY T V WITH SOME ONE FROM A SMOKING

JUST TESIN WILL POWER LINE  WT ON'T PO OSA WORK NS EL TONS GRT O THE NOTHIW YE ALANCAR NEVER HAD ANY TRAINING IN PSYCHOLOGY OR MEDICIN HE SAYS ONE DAY HE JUST REALIZED WHAT A CONSMOKING IS AND TOOK THINGS FROM THERE START OF WORKING WITH INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES AND GROUP SEMINARS TAN THE BOOK AND ALTIMATELY IN ORGANIZATION THAT OPERATES IN MORE THAN FIFTY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD FOR MY MONEY HIS CRED WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THAT OF A THERAPISTOR PSYCHIATRIS HE WAS A SMOKER FOR BOUT AS LONG AS I WAS AND MUCH HEAVIER SOMETIMES A HUNDRED CIGARETTES A DAY YE TRAIED TO QUIT A LOT OF TIMES BEFORE HITTING UPON HIS METHOD AT WHICH MON HE JUST STOPPED ON A DIME IF ONLY HE FIGURE TO DOUTWAY SOONER ALANCAR DIED OF LONGCANTS ER AN TWO THOUSAND SEX  HE HADN'T BEEN A SMOKER FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS     I  FO TIS GROWING EXCITEMENT AS I READ THE BOOK I WAS TARTING TO BEAT OUT MY FUARE OF PITTING IT ONE POINT I WROTE IN A NOTE BOOK ALANCAR IS WRITE ABOUT THE TASTE IT'S FOUL SMOKE FELT BAD GOING DOWN MY LUNGS I THINK MY THINKING ABOUT SMOKING HAS GENUINELY CHANGED THE NIGHT BEFORE MY FINAL DAY OF SMOKING I FELT LIKE A KID ON CHRISTMAS EVE EVE SORT OF THRILLED AND WISHING THE DAY WOULD JUST HURRY UP AND GET HERE ALREADY ALANCAR SAID THIS MIGHT HAPPEN THE NEXT NIGHT THE SUMBER TWENTY SEVENTH I SMOKE MY FINAL CIGARETTE SORT OF RITUAL BUILT INTO THE PROCESS FOR SOMMERS AT I WANTED TO BE OUTSIDE WALKING THE NEIGHBORHOOD I SMOKED IT MAY BE FASTER THAN ANY CIGARETT EVER KNOCKED THE BURNING EMBER OFF THE BUT THREW IT IN SOMEBODY'S TRASH CAN AND SAID OUT LOUD GOOD BY CIGARETTES AND WHEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY I WANTED TO CIGARETTE MORE THAN I EVER REMEMBER WANTING ONE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE BOOK SAYS AS SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN NO WHAT I DID OR DIDN'T DO OR WHAT EXACTLY WENT WRONG BUT SUDDENLY THE WAY FELT ANYTHING BUT EASY IN THE BOOK OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALANCAR SAYS SOME VERSION OF THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL WITH DRAWAL FROM NICKOTIN IS A VERY MILD SLIGHTLY EMPTY IN SECURE FEELING IT'S SO MILD THAT MOST SMOKERSDONE EVEN NOTICE IT THROUGHOUT THEIR SMOKING LIVES I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THE PHYSICAL WITHDRAWAL ONLY LASTS THREE DAYS OR IS IT A WEEK OR IS IT THREE WEEKS AND AFTER THAT IT'S MERELY PSYCHOLOGICAL I'VE HEARD THE INDIVIDUAL CRAVINGS LAST ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE MINUTES AND THAN THEY PASS ALL I CAN SAY IS IN MY EXSPERIENCE ALL OF THIS IS UTTER HORSESHIT I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF INDIVIDUAL CRAVINGS MY CASE WITH DRAWL HAS MEANT A CONSTANT CRAZED YEARNING THAT VARIES IN TOLERABILITY THROUGHOUT THE DAY THIS IS HOW HI DESCRIBED IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN IT'S LIKE A WORLD WIDE ICH LIKE ALL OF MY LIMBS ARE PHANTOM LIMBS LIKE IS SWALLOWED A LIVE ANIMAL MUCH LARGER THAN ME THAT PROMPTLY DIED AND NOW I HAVE TO WALK AROUND WITH IT INSIDE OF ME SOUL AND ALL OR IT'S LIKE OPENING ALL THESE AWFUL LITTLE PACKAGES IN WHICH THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN'T SEE THAT PAINFULLY STINGS ME AND THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MANY MORE I HAVE TO OPEN NOR FOR HOW LONG IT IS THE THING I'M THINKING ABOUT MORE THAN ANY OTHER THING AND MORE THAN ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS THIS SWAS ON JANUARY THIRTEENTHOKE IVE HAD OF SUSNEKS AND NOTHING MAKES IT BETTER LIKE LITERALLY NOTHING MAKES IT BETTER EVERYTHING MAKES EVERYTHING THAT I DO IN STEAD OF SMOKING MAKES ME WANT O SMOKE MORE THIS IS THE WORST DAY THAT OF THE NON SMOKING THAT THERE'S BEEN SO FAR THEY WHAT IS IT WERE NOW GOING INTO DAY SEVENTEEN AH  NOW I I DON'TNO LIKE THEY'RE HARD THEY'RE ALL HARD THE THING ABOUT THINKING SOMETHING'S GOING TO BE EASY IS THAT WHEN IT'S ULTIMATELY NOT IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER LIKE YEF I CAN'T DO IT I MUST BE AN IDIOT THEN THINKING BACK ON SOME OF THE PASSAGES IN THE BOOK I FELT GASLIT LIKE MY LIVED EXPERIENCE WAS BEING QUESTION THIS IS ALANCAR IN A BRITISH TAKSHOWS SOMETIME IN THE EARLY OTS WE TOLD ABOUT THESE TERRIBLE WITHDROLL YOUR SIGHT IS ROT WLL WAITET IT AT YU WY IT SHOW ME I CAN SAY EXACTLY WHERE JANUARY EIGHTEENTH  LIKE THREE WEEKS IN I HAD THIS ATTACK I WAS ON THE CORNER IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD TRYING TO DECIDE WE THERE'D GO HOME GO TO THE BAR  JUST THE BAR AND MY BRAIN WASS LIKE I WERE WALKING ABOUT I'M FOR A CIGARETTE HA AND I SAID NO WE DON'T DO THAT ANY MORE AND MY BRAIN WAS LIKE YOU MEAN ITSITTIME FOR A CIGARETTE I SAID NO IT'S NOT AND THEN IT'S LIKE I WAS PHYSICALLY PUNCHED IN THE SOLAR PLEXES WITH SOMETHING ELECTRIC THAT SENT A SHOCK UP THROUGH MY FACE AND HAS I SCREAMS  CRAZYIN I LIIN  LIKE TURNED WOCKING IS TIS HOC LIKE HOH GOT WELL IT BETTER GET BETTER AT SOME POIN IT GOT WORSE I'VE GAINED WAIT BEEN DRINKING MORE I WHEN A MONTH WITH NO NIKOTINE AT ALL AND THEN GAVE IN AND STARTED HAVING A NIKOTINE LOWSANE HERE AND THERE I HAVE BUT TO A DAY NOW WHICH NATURALLY MADE ME RELITIGATE EVERYTHING DALANCAR HAD SAID ELSE MADE ME WONDER LIKE WHY WASN'T THIS WORKING FOR ME IF IT WORKS FOR SO MANY PEOPLE SO I START LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND I STUMBLED ACROSS THIS POGCAST THAT WAS WAY MORE REVOLATORY TO ME ABOUT MY ADDICTION THAN ANYTHING IN THE BOOK WELCOME TO THE HUBOR MAN LO ONCAN N  CU SCIENCE  SCIENCE PAC TOINE FREIN N LI  YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH ANTERHUMMANDHE'S KIND OF A NERO SCIENCE ROCKSTAR NOW GO AS A LAB IT STAMPORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINES YET WHERE HE RESEARCHES NARROW BIOLOGY AN OPTOMOLOGY S I DON'T PIRSPRID APART FROM THAT HE'S MADE IT A PERSONAL MISSION TO EXPLAIN HOW YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WORK SO YOU CAN MAY BE MAKE THETTER CHOICES OR YO DR AND HE HAS AN EPISODE ON NICKOTINE WHICH MADE ME FEEL LIKE SOME ONE HAD PUT THEIR HAND ON MY SHOULDER LOOKED ME IN THE EYE YO AND SAID YOU HE SIR YET ARE NOT INSANE THE ONLY BASES AGAIN SALANCAR CENTRAL PREMISE IS THAT ALL THE THING SMOKERS LIKE ABOUT  SMOKING IIN RELAXES US AND FOCASES US AND GIVES US A BOOSE CARSAYS THAT THE ONLY THING WERE FEELING IS JUST THE WITHDRAWAL GOING AWAY BUT ACCORDING TO HUBOURMAN THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE BRAIN CHEMISTRY OF THIS FOR YEARS DECADES AND JUST TO BE SUPERBREVIATED ABOUT IT HERE PONCESTIS TWO HOURS LONG NIKOTIN JUSES UP YOUR BRAIN WITH THESE THREE CHEMICALS DOPEMIN YOU'L BEBHARD OF DOPEMIN W PEOPLE THINK IT CAUSES PLEASURE BUT IT'S ALSO THE THING THAT MAKES YOU WANT PLEASURE STRI IT MOTIVATES YOU TICULAR MAKES YOU GOUD STRIVE  PURSUE I A SEET O COLING WHICH I SYOUA NEVER HEARD US RELEASE EPS YOU FOKUS IM UP WITH IDEAS SELLS PLUS  STHIS IS WERD YOU HAVE A SEET TO COLLING RECEPTORS ON YOUR MUSCLES TOO WHICH HUBORMAN SAYS COULD EXPLAIN WHY SOME PEOPLE FEEL MORE PHYSICALLY RELAXED ON NIKOTINEN VORTUE AFTER NEFFEREN AND THEN APANEFERAND WHICH YOU COULD JUST CALL A GRENALIN SO WHEN ALANCAR SAYS THE NIKOTINE ITSELF DOESN'T GIVE YOU A BOOST IT GIVES YOU A BOOST THI YOU MOW AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER WE NOW HAVE A VERY CLEAR PICTURE REWARD PATHWAYS ARE TURNED ON ATTENTION IS TURNED ON ALERTNESS IS TURNED ON YOU FEEL BETTER THAN YOU FELT A FEW MINUTES AGO YOU'RE BLOOD PRESSURE IS UP YOUR HEARTRATE IS UP YOU'RE PREPAREDNESS FOR THINKING IS ELEVATED IS WELL AND YET YOUR BODY IS SOMEWHAT RELAXED THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING STATE OF MIND AND BODY INTERESTIN BECAUSE IT'S SOMEWHAT IDEAL FOR COGNITIVE WORK IF YOU'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND WORK ON A BOOK WERE YOU GOING TO SIT DOWN AND TRYING FIGURE OUT A HARD MASTH PROBLEM ORE YOU GOING TO WRITE A LETTER THAT'S BEEN REALLY CHALLENGING YOU FOR YOU TO WRITE OR MAYBE THAT YOU'R REALLY EXCITED TO WRITE BUT THAT YOU'VE BEEN OU KNO SLOW TO GET OUT THE DOOR FOR WHATEVER REASON HERE I'M TALKING ABOUT MY OWN HABITS OF PRECOSTINATION  THAT STATE OF BEING VERY ALERT BUT YOUR BODY BEING RELAXED IS ALMOST IF NOT THE OPTIMAL STATE FOR GETTING MENTAL WORKD ON WE'RE TURING BUT ONE MOLECULE NICOTINE FOUND IN PLANTS THIK TO MATOES AND POTATOES AND THE TOBACCO PLANT ONE MOLECULE THAT CAN TRIGGER ACTIVATION OF ALL THE CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS AND MOTIVATION IN ONE FELL THAT IS ROMAR WHEN I GOTN'T TOUCH WITH HUVERMEN AND WE SAT DOWN FOR CONVERSATION HE SAID THE STUFF WAS OBVIOUS TO HIM THE FIRST TIME HE SMOKE O CIGARETTE HIS FOURTIN SAME TIMEHE HAD HIS FIRST CUP OF BLACK COFFEE I THOUGH THAT I WAS ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GUESTS UNTIL I TOOK IT MY FIRST DRAG OFF A CIGARETTE AND THEN I REALIZE TO WOW WOW WOW NICOTINE JUST MAKE S EVERYTHING LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT IF YOUL FOCUSE AND RELAXED I MEAN THAT AT'S A VERY HARD COMBO FOR MOST PEOPLE DO JUST DROP THEMSELVES INTO UNFORTUNATELY NICCOTINE ALSO HAS A LOT OF HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS CAN STRICTS BLOOD FLOW AND CAUSE HART PROBLEMS AND JUST TO SAY THE WHOLE SECOND HALF OF THE PODCAST IS ABOUT HOW IN CREDIBLY BAD TOBACCO IS FOR YOU FUBERMAN DOESN'T SMOKE ANY MORE ERE USE ANY KIND OF NICCOTIN I RAN HIM THROUGH SOME OF ALANCARS CLAIMS ABOUT NICCOTIN AND HE DID GIVE ME IS TAKE ON THEM ALTHOUGH WARILY I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE ANY ONE FROM USING A RESOURCE LIKE THIS BOOK THAT COULD HELP THEM MOVE AWAY FROM UN UNHEALTHY PRACTISE SIR A JERT I DON'T WAN TO UNDER MIND HIS HIS EFFORTS CAUSE I THINK THAT THE EFFORT IS A NOBLE AND IMPORTANT ONE BUT HE SAYS ALANCAR'S RIGHT THAT YOU CAN GET SO DEPENDENT ON NICOTINE THAT YOU DON'T DERIVE ANY BENEFIT ANY MORE AND JUSTSMOKE YOU CAN FEEL NORMAL THAT CAN APPEN WITH ANY ADDICTIVE DRETE RBUT HE SAYS THERE ARE TONS OF STUDIES SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT NICOTIN HELPS WITH FOCUS TRESSES N AND NOW IT DOESN'T CURBYOU STRESS BUT IT MIGHT MAKE YOU BETTER ABLE TO HANDLE STREST IS S CAUS YOU'R MORE KEIT UP IND VIGILAN SO IF THE CENTRAL PREMISE OF THE BOOK HIS FLOD AND NICOTIN CAN DO ALL OF THESE ENJOYABLE USEFUL THINGS WHY DO YOU THINK IF YOU WERE TO CONJECTURE WID THIS SISDAM THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME PER SAY WORK FOR SO MANY PEOPAL A MAN YOU NOW LIKE I JUS THINGIN ABOUT THAT I I THINK I KNOW WHY SO FROM A NURBA EN I LOOK AT EVERYTHING THROUGH THE LENDS OF BIOLOGY R YOU KNOW MUCH TO THE DISCOMFORT OF PEOPLOMOST TO ME A MI CAN SAY THAT THE BOOK DID A VERY INTERESTING THING I HAVE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT WHAT HE DID IS HE TRIED TO BY PASS ALL THE DEEPER BIOLOGY OF DOPOMING A SEAT OF COLINE A DICTION ET CETERA AND WHAT HE DID WAS HE SAID YOU'VE GOT A FOREBRAIN YOUR FOREBRAIN CAN TELL ITSELF STORIES BY TELLING ITSELF STORIES YOU CAN SET CONTECT SO LET'S TELL YOURSELF A STORY AND THE STORY IS THIST WITHDRAWAL DOESN'T REALLY EXIST OR IT EXIS BUT YOU KNOW NICOTINE'S OT THAT BAI OLOGAVEN NICOTINE DOESN'T REALLY EXIST YAND WHEN YOU FEEL ON COMFORTABLE THAT'S YOU KNOWTHER WORDS HE USED THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE WAY IT REALLY WORKS IN THE READER TO TRICK THE READER INTO TRICKING THEMSELVES IN TO BY PASSING WHAT WOULD BUT SE SHUL BE A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED PROCESS NOW FOR SOME PEOPLE AND APPARENTLY CELEBRITIES IT WORKED FOR THEM BUT WHAT IF I CAME ALONG WITH JUST THE TINIEST BIT OF KNOWLEDGE TO THE CONTRARY OR WHAT IF SOME ONE LIKE YOU HAS IT AN EXPERIENCE TO THE CONTRARY WELL THEN BAM YOU'RE RIGHT BACK IN SQUARE ONE I GUESS IT JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME OR THERES SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME THAT'S WHAT I'D BEEN FEELING LIKE AND THAT'S SORT OF ENDEMIC TO THE METHOD LIKE IF IT DOESN'T WORK IT'S CAUSE YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS READN'T UNDERSTAND PART OF IT READ IT AGAIN OR CALLUS OR ATTEND THE LIVE SEMINAR IN ONE ADDITION OF THE BOOK ALANCAR WRITES THAT IF YOU'RE THINKING I'M STILL CRAVING CIGARETTES AFTER READING IT THAN QUOTE YOU ARE BEING VERY STUPIT HOW CAN YOU CLAIM I WNT TO BE A NON SMOKER AND THEN SAY I WANT O CIGARETTE THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IF YOU SAY I WANT TO CIGARETTE YOU'RE SAYING I WANT TO BE A SMOKER NON SMOKERS DON'T WANT TO SMOKE CIGARETTES YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO BE SO STOP PUNISHING YOURSELF HAVING THIS INFORMATION KNOWING WHAT NIKOTIN WAS AND H IS NO LONGER DOING TO ME WAS COMFORTING AS I WAS LIKE IT'S NOT IN MY IMAGINATION I WISH I'D KNOWN ALL THIS BEFORE I'D STUBBED THAT I'D HAD MORE OF A MAP OF THE LANDSCAPE INSTEAD OF JUST PRETENDING I WASN'T EVEN ON THE CONTINENT AN THIS WAS MARCH THERTY FIRST THE DAY AFTER I TALKED WITH HUMERMENT STHREE MONTHS IN BEEN TRYING TO GET TEST FOR LIKE NO LIKE TEN OR FIFTEEN IT LIKE EVERYTHING'S JUST A LITTLE BIT HARDER SINCE I STUP SMOKING  LIKE SLOWER I'M SLOWER AND ALL FORGET I MEAN THAT SUPPOSEDLY IT'S GOOD FOR NICOTIN IS GOOD FOR WORKING MEMORY MEANING LIKE  WE WHY WHY DID I COME INTO THE KITCHEN AGAIN O YE AH ND TEND IVEN DO IV LIKE NO WORKING MEMORY ANY MORE AND SO IT TAKES ME FOR EVER TO DO SIMPLE THINGS AND THEY'RE NOT ASS THAT'S NOT THE WORD FOR GETTING DRESSED BUT THEY'RE NOT IT'S LIKE IT' JUST FEELS LIKE EVERYTHING FEELS A LITTLE BE LOK AT SURE NESS THEREVE BEEN LOTS OF NEW STORIES ABOUT ALANCAR'S EASY WAY HE WAS INTERVIEW TO TON IN THE UQUET WHEN HE WAS ALIVE AND THE PEOPLE TOOK OVER THE ORGANIZATION AFTER HIM THAN A LOT OF PRESS BUT LOOKING HIGH AND LOW I HADN'T SEEN ANYONE QUESTION THE SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY OF THE METHOD EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THE BIOLOGY HUMORMAN TALKS ABOUT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO ITHER I'M MISSING SOMETHING WHICH HAPPENS ALVE WHERE NOBODY'S EVER RAISED THIS PAHTICULAR ISSUE WITH THEM BEFORE SOYOU'LL BE THINY I DID EXONIS CONT SO I SAT DOWN WITH JOHNDIKIN ALANCAR'S SUCCESSOR HE'S THE GLOBALCI O AN SENIOR FACILITATOR OF EASY WAY NOW HE ALSO TOOK THE SEMINAR HIMSELF TO QUIKSMOKING AND SAYS HE WAS SO ENTHRALLED BY HOW WELL IT WORKD T THAT HE IQUOT ON'T QUOTE HASTLED AND HARANGED ALANCAR TO LET HIM GET INVOLVED THEY BUT ID HEAD SOMETIMES OR OIS BUT JOHN REALLY CONSIDERS CAR TO BE A GENIUS I ASKED HIM IF THEY'D NEVER TALKED ABOUT BRAIN CHEMISTRY WHEN CAR WAS ALIVE HE SAID THEY HAD ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T REALLY INTERESTED IN BESON SIT YOU MUSTN'T KNOW I THINK HE NOT MO REALLY REAN GESAYS SONE OF  THINGS A I REALLYTHING AS MUCH I TO BRING TO THE SIE WITH IM MYGSAD GEN YOU NOW WE TALK TO BES HE WOULD SAY THAT HE WAS LIKE THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERT ON QUITTING SMOKANG E I YOU SMILING AND I AT M SO HE HE WOULD ENT LIKE SORT OF AS THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERT IN QUITIGS FOR SELF PROFESSO WORLDS LEADING EXPERT IN QUITTING SMOKANG BE BE NECESSARILY CURIOUS ABOUT THAT STAFF YOU OFTHING IS BUSY DOING OTHER THING WA IIN TERMS OF I THE EASY WAY METHOD IM MUS NOT BE IN A POTS OF HE IS FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN THER RE A DICTIONS  RISHES THERE'S THE EASY WAY TO STOP DRINKING THE EASY WAY W E ING H TO LOSE WEIGHT I'S ONE ABOUT BEING ADDICTED TOYOUR FOND LOTS OF THINGS I SHOULD SAY AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE BOOK DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I READ ADDRESSES BRAIN SCIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT IT'S VERY SELECTIVE AND IT STILL CLAIMS NOBODY'S EVER HAD ANY PLEASURE OR BENEFIT FROM NICKETINE I STARTED TAKING JOHN DICY THROUGH WHAT I'D LEANE FROM INTERHUBOUR MEN THEE RESEARCH THAT  CONTRADICTS FETS IN THE BOOK AND THAT MY HELP EXPLAIN WHY FOR LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO WALK AWAY FROM SMOKING SO WHEN THE BOOK SAYS THAT IT THAT IT DOESNAN'T PHYSICALLY AD AND CONCENTRATION JUST SCIENTIFICALLY IT DOES ATE AND CONSENT SION AN E RON YOU THINK HE'S WRONG I DON'T THINK HE R O KNOWHIS ROM HE'S A NERROW BIOLODGY O O CARE WARD   I MEANIT  NOT BE DISRESPECT FOR YET HE KNOW SURE HE HAS A THEORY HES IS E AS ON EUN I MEAN IT'S BASED ON OSHOULD BIS JUST WRONG S OMMANY LEVELS ANAM  I'M STRUGGLING WATS TAM WHY IS A DESPERATION TO PROVE OR I BELIEVE THE NICKETINE DOES SOMETHING WHEN IT DOESN'T YOUMEVE HUTS MUCH NONSENSE IN MY LIFE I'M SORRY YOU VERY NOCE GM SURE SURELE BELIEVES WHAT HE SAING BUT IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE MIS UNDERSTAND EACH OTHE BEUS I'M NOT LOKING FOR POSITIVES OF NICKETING OU I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR IT LIKE WHA WHAT IS THE MECHANISM I WAS JUST LIKE LOOKING FOR WHT ITS A MECHANISM AND WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT THE DIFFERENT NOURO CHEMICALS THAT THAT NICETINE E VOKS IN THE BRAIN AN IT JUST FELT LIKE THAT THE METHOD WAS PRADICATED ON A LINE THAT LY OU ITINLRES YOU WOULD YOU TIGHT NICKOTINE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE NOW ALTHOUGH AND O NO I ONE OT WELL IT WASN'T MY PLAN IT WASN'T MY PLAN BECAUSE I ISN'T YO PLAN WHY ISN'T YOU PLANIF ES GIVE ME THESE TREMENDOUS

MELL ME MORE THAN ONCE WEEKS AFTER THE FACT TO SAY HE WAS STILL REALING FROM THE INTERVIEW AGAIN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE WOULD PUSH BACK AT THE ALLANCAR EASY WAY METHOD ANOTHE WE'VE ONLY EVER DONE GOOD IN THE WORLD HE SAID WESE THAT'S LIKE KICKING A CAT AND WHY WOULD ANY ONE EVER SUGGEST THERE WAS A BENEFIT TO NICKETIN ITHER THAN MAY BE THE TOBACCO COMPANIES A BIG FARME IF IT WAS TRUE I COULD ALMOST LIVE WITH THAT IF NICKETING DID MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO COMEO TRITE NON NICKETINATICS TO CONCENTRAN  I COULD LIVE WITH THAT ANDD I WHEN O O GENUINE INTEREST TO LOOK AT THE STUDIES YOU LOOK TAT IF THE WORE FONPOTOUS TO IT A SERNY IT NOWLEDGE THAT  BUT BUT THERE ON TH IT IS JUST I GUESS HOW CAN YOU SAY THERE AREN'T WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE SCIENCE WHEN THAT THAT IT'S JUST NOT AN AND THAT'S FINE THAT IT'S NOT INTERESTING TO YOU BUT WHEN IT'S NOT INTERESTING TO YOU AND SO YOU HAVEN'T REALLY ROUT ABOUT IT AND ALLANTOND REALLY READ ABOUT IT AND HOW THAT ND HOW CAN YOU SAY IT'S NOT TRI JUST E SER RELEVAN ISN'T IT I DON I WANT TO A I WOULDN'T WONE T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME DISCUSSING WHETHER THE MOONS MAGHT OUT  CHESE PRETTY STO NO MI I THINK THE HEIS HUGY DANGEOUS TO TALK ABOUT YOU NO A  THERE MIGT BE A  BENEFITS TO NICKETIN UT IS JUST SIMPPLY NOT TRUE I'S UNFORTUNE OF THE BOOK TIN WORK FR YOU ALREADY SORRY ABOUT THAT AND I A WISH YOU'D REACHED OUT I HOP OR THE TIME A BECAUSE IT 'S MAF TO BE THIS COMPICATE IT READY DOS' IM REAPSYOU SMOKING AND O  WHAT AS YOU CAN BEYU TE PROMOCIT AFTER THE  HAYOU IM OU A IF YOU THINK BESUNDERSTANDING THIS HELP YOU CONTINUE SMOKING UST BR BUT U WELT THANK YOU FOR ASKING I AM I THINK I MO SAID BASICALLY  TH THEN JOHNDICY SAYS THE ORGANIZATION DOESN'T MAKE ANY CLAIMS ABOUT THE SUCCESSORATE OF THE BOOK FOR ANY MEASURABLE SUCCESS THEY ALWAYS POINT TOF THE SEMINARE THEY GIVE WHICH ALANCAR ALWAYS SAID WAS ABOUT NINETY PER CENT EFFECTIVE HE BASE THAT FIGURE ON ONLY ABOUT TEN PER CENT OF SEMINAR GOERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MONEY BACK GUARANTEE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK YOU HAVE TO DO THE SESSION TWO ADDITIONAL TIMES FOR FREE ANYWAY THE COMPANIES BACKED OFF FROM THAT CLAIM IN RECENT YEARS THE SEMINAR WAS PUT THROUGH A COUPLE OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WHERE IT WAS PITTED AGAINST METHODS THAT OFFER BOTH BEHAVIOURALL SUPPORT ANFORMACOLOGY NICKOTIN REPLACE MENT THAT KIND OF THING THE MORE RECENT AND BIGGER OF THOSE STUDIES FOUND THAT NINETEEN PER CENT AF THE ALANCAR PEOPLE WERE STILL QUIT AFTER SIX MONTHS VIRS IS FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE OTHER GROUP THE MARGIN OF AIR THAT BASICALLY MEANS THERE ON PAR THOUGH NINETEIN PER CENT SUCCESS STILL MEANS THAT THE METHOD DIDN'T WORK FOR FOUR OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE IN THE STUDY JOHNDICY TOLD ME HE DOESN'T THING THOSE STUDIES ORE A GOOD REFLECTION OF WHAT THE RESULTS ARE OUT IN THE REAL WORLD AN LITERALLY ILOOKING THROUGH MY KITCHEN WINDOW WATCHING POLICE OFFICERS SMOKE ON THE FIRE ESCAPE OF THE PRECINCT THIS IS FOUR MONTHS IN IU KNO KIND OF WHEREVER YOU LOOK WHEREVER YE SMELL THERE IT IS A YOUR PAST IT'S LIKE YOU BROKE UP WITH SOME ONE WHO IS HORRIBLE FOR YOU AND THAN YOU LEAVE YOUR APARTMENT AND THAT PERSEN IS IN EVERY STREET COIRNER WAFTING THEIR PERFUME AT YOU WHICH WAS AND REMAINS INTOXICATING LITERALLY AND THEN YOU GO BACK TO THE CONFINES OF YOUR APARTMENT AND YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND THERE THEY ARE BLOWING KISSES AT A BRICK WALL NOW I CAN'T TELL WHETHER I AM TALKING ABOUT THE METAPHOR WERE THE PHYSICAL REALITY  ACTUALLY MAY HAVE STUMBLED INTO A REALLY GOOD THOUGH KIND OF WORRYING EXPLANATION AS TO WHY I'M NOT IN THE PER CENTILE WHATEVER IT IS OF ALANCAR'S SUCCESSTORIES I TALKED WITH A PROMINENT PSYCHIATRIST WHO'SE HAD PATIENTS THAT USE THE METHOD SO SHE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE BOOK HER NAMES ANNA LEMPKI SHE RUNS THE ADDICTION MEDICINE DUEL DIAGNOSIS CLININC AT STANDFORD CHELSO WHT A BOOK CALLED DOPEMI NATION WHICH IS WHERE I LEAND THAT NICCOTINE INCREASES DOPAMIN LEVELS BY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT WHICH IS FIFTY PER CENT MORE THAN SECTS I CALLD HER TO TALK SCIENCE BUT OUR CONVERSATION BECAME A LITTLE LIKE A THERAPECESSION AT SOME POINTS LIKE I TOLD HER THIS THIS THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE SHOWER WHEN I FIRST TURN THE WATER COLD AT THE END MAKES YOU FEEL GOD AFTER NOT DURING AND WEARDLY I DON'T JUST CRAVE A CIGARETTE RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT IT'S THIS VERY SPECIFIC SENSATION LIKE I'M TAKING A BIG WIF FROM A GLASS ASH TRAY THAT IT JUST EMPTIED BUT HAVEN'T WASHED OUT YET IT'S NOT GROSE FEELING IT'S A WANTING FEELING LIGGRETS IS IT HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU TURN THE CLOOK FEEL FIRST FEEL THE PAIN OF THE COLD WATER YES O CASE OF THAT'S VERY INTERESTING THERE AM THERE'S A WHOLE FAMOUS SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS SHOU TOLD ME THERE WERE THESE STUDIES DONE WHERE THEY WOULD TAKE A ROTINT AND GET IT ADDICTED TO SOME DRUG BY LETTING IT PRESS A LEVER OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO RECEIVE THAT DRUG BUT THEND IF YOU TAKE THE DRUG OUT OF THE EQUATION IT'LL VENELY STOP ITTING THEBUTEN CAUSE WIT'S THE POINT NDTHEN IT WANDERS OFF TO DO OTHER THINGS IN THE CAGE TO AMUSE ITSELF HOWEVER IF THEN YOU TAKE THAT SAME ANIMAL AND YOU EXPOSE IT TO A PAINFUL FOOTSHOCK THE ANIMAL WILL IMMEDIATELY RUN OVER TO THE LEVER AND WILDLY START PRESSING IN ESLY TO YE IS NOT INTERESTING SO I SUSPECT THAT THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOU THAT BY HAVING COLD WATER AM SHOWERS WHAT YOU'R DOING IS YOUR SHOCKING YOUR BODY WITH A PAINFUL STIMULUS WHICH IS THEN TRIGGERING YOUR AUTOMATIC NEURLOGICAL SAFETY AND COMPENSITORY MECHANISM WHICH IS TO SMOKE A CIGARETT WELL THAT'S WILD WELL YE YE IN OTHER WORDS IN YOU'VE CREATED IN A LABORATE NEUROLOGICAL CIRCUIT A ROUND SMOKING AN EVEN MONTHS AFTER YOU'VE STOPPED SMOKING THAT NEUROLOGICAL CIRCUIT IS STILL HEALTHY AND FIRING AWAY IN RESPONSE TO SIGNIFICANCE TRESSERS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE THE PHYSICAL ADDICTION TO NICOTINE AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ADDICTION TON ICOTINE LIKE THAT THAT SOUNDS PHYSICAL TO ME THAT I MEAN TIT'S O YE IT'S VERY PHYSICAL WALL THIS TIME I'D BEEN FOCUSSING ON THE DAMAGE THAT SMOKING HAD DONE TO MY LUNGS THIRTY FIVE YEARS WORTH OF DAMAGE I SOMEHOW HADN'T THOUGHT IN TERMS OF DOING THAT AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO MY BRAIN TO THAT'LL TAKE A LONG TIME TO REPAIR AND ALEMP YE TOLD ME ESPECIALLY GIVEN MY AGE I BRAIN ISN'T AS PLASTIC AS IT ONCE WAS AND THERE'S ANOTHER SCHOOL OF THOUGHT SHE SAID MORE DEPRESSING ONE WHICH WONDERS WHETHER THE DAMAGE COULD BE SO FAR GONE I CAN'T REPAIR IT IT'LL ALWAYS BE IN THE IND OF STATE OF PERPETUAL NEUROLOGICAL WITHDROWLL WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE SOME KIND OF INTERVENTION AND IN YOUR CASE THAT MIGHT LOOK SOMETHING LIKE NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPEES FOR LIFE POTENTIALLY OR LIFE I WHAT WHAT'S THAT FOR LIFE YE FOR LIFE AND POTENTIALLY AT HIGHER DOSES THAN WHAT YOURE CURENTLY TAKING WELL YE SO WE USED TO USE NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THEREAPE JUST TO HELP PEOPLE QUIT BUT MORE AND MORE WERE NOW USING THEM IN THE MAINNENCE FASE WHERE PEOPLE ARE JUST USING THEM FOUR YEARS TO DECADES AND AGAIN THE THINKING THERE IS THAT WELL YOU KNOW THE IDEAL IS THAT WITH SUSTAINED ABSINENCE YOUR BRAIN WOULD HEAL AND YOU WOULD RETURN TO WHATEVER YOUR PRESMOKING BASELINE WAS BUT IN REALITY WHAT WE SEE IS THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T GET TO THAT PLACE AND THAT THEY MAN MEED SOME FORM OF NICOTINE TO FEEL AND FUNCTION O CAY I'M GOING FORWARD INDEFINITELY WEL SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I'VE BROKN MY MY BRAIN SORT OF MY MY MYT OPEN MEAN RECEPTORS TO THE POINT WHERE LIKE THEY'RE JUST NOT GUNE A RETURNED A NORMAL KIND OF YE I MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT'S POSSIBLE I MATE I DON'T LIKE TO OU SAY THAT YOUR BRAIN IS BROKN BUT I GUESS JUST TO THINK ABOUT IT LITTLE DIFFERENTLY JUST COULD BE THAT YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE BRAIN PLASTICITY TO COMPLETELY REVERSE THE CHANGES I HAD TO LISTEN BACK TO THAT PART OF THE INTERVIEW A FEW TIMES TO FULLY FEEL THE BOMDROP OF IT I KNOW IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS OR ANYTHING EVEN AN UNOFFICIAL ONE AND WHEN A OVER REACT BUT THE IMPACT IS SOMETHING LIKE WHEN I LEARNED I HAVE LUNG DISEASE PERMANENT BRAINCHANGES AND LACK OF PLASTICITY MAKES ME THINK OF AGING WHICH MAKES ME THINK OF DYING NICOTINE REPLACEMENT FOR LIFE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE HOW LONG IS THATCON TO ME AND STILL YEVEN A SESSING ALL OF THAT DAMAGE KNOWING ALL THE HAVOC THAT SMOKING HAS REKED ON MY BODY STILL I WISH THERE WAS SOME TOMENSHON IN WHICH I COULD KEEP DOING IT YOURE WONDERING IT'S NOW BEEN SEVEN MONTHS AND I STILL OVIN SMOKED A CIGARETT EVERY NOW AND TEN I WAS WAKE UP TO IT ALL OVER AGAIN LIKE STILL MON DOING TO TALKING WITH ANALEMPKI CONFIRMED THIS IDEA THAT HAD BEEN PECKING AT ME SINCE I FIRST FREAD THE BOOK ALANCAR SAYS

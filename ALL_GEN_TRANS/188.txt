THESTRENFOLDS IN A SERIES OF LETTERS TWEEN TO MARMS IT'S AN EXERT OF A SHORT STORY BYNEFESA THOMPSON'S SPIRES RAT FIRST BY ACTOR'S ESDAVAS NERICA ALEXANDERA TUESDAY OCTOBER FIRST NINETEEN NINETY ONE HELLO MONICA I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER ME FROM THE CLASS FIELD TRIP TO THE GETTY IN SEPTEMBER IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT YOUR DAUGHTER FATIMA MAY HAVE STARTED A NASTY RUMOR ABOUT MY CHRISTINIA I HOPE TO CLAR THIS UP AS WE BOTH KNOW HOW UGLY THESE THINGS CAN GET IT IS TRUE THAT CHRISTINIA'S HAMPSTER DIED RECENTLY BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE THAT IT DIED AT CHRICY'S HAND AT NO TIME HAS CHRISSI EVER PUT HAMBONE OR ANY OF HER PREVIOUS HAMPSTERS IN THE MICRO WAVE DRIER OR DISH WASHER WHAT KIND OF CHILD WOULD MAKE UP SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT SOUNDS AND I SAY THIS RESPECTFULLY SO I HOPE YOU WON'T BE OFFENDED LIKE FATIMA HAS HAD A VERY HARD TIME GETTING ACKLENLAED HERE AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE BUT I DO HOPE YOU WILL DEAL WITH HER BEFORE ANY SUCH INCIDENTS BECOME FREQUENT CHILDREN WHO START LYING YOUNG OFTEN AND UP WITH LONG TIME PATTERNS OF DISHONESTI ALL BEST DOCTOR LICINDA JOHNSTON CID LIFESENCE THERABIS WELCOME WAGON WESTWOD PRIMARY SEVENTS CORDINATOR JACK IN JILL CLERMONT BRANCH MONDAY OCTOBER SEVEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE DEARLICINDA I APOLOGIZED FOR MY LATE REPLY BUT I ONLY FOUND YOUR LETTER AT THE BOTTOM OF FATIMA'S BACKPACK WHEN I DID MY WEEKLY CLEANING THANK YOU FOR WRITING TO ME FATIMA SAYS SHE ONLY REPEAT IT WHAT CHRISTINIA HERSELF TOLD HER MANY OF FATIMA'S STORIES ABOUT CHRISTINIA THIS YEAR AND LAST WHICH I WON'T RECOUNT HERE HAVE BEEN DISTURBING TO SAY THE LEAST BUT NONE IS DISTURBING AS CHRISTINIA'S ENJOYMENT OF TORTURING WROTEDS FATIMA HAS A STRONG IMAGINATION AND WRITES BEAUTIFUL LYRIC POETRY WHICH SHE STARTED READING AT E FOR BUT SHE DOES NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF LYINE OR TELLING GRUESOME STORIES AND I'MLIKE CHRISTINIA SHE HAS NO HISTORY OF RUNNING OFF WITH OTHER GIRL'S SHOES WHILE THEIR FEET DANGLE FROM THE MONKEY BARS I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT FATIMA AND EVEN THOUGH CHRISTINIA HAS MADE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR HER TO FIND FRIENDS AT WESTWOOD FFATIMA WILL ACCLAMATE SOON SHE'S GOING TO A SLEEP OVER AT EMILY'S THIS WEEKEN IS CHRISTINIA GOING IF SO I HOPE YOU WILL ENCOURAGE HER TO PLAY NICE BEST MONICA WILLISS P H T P S IT IS TRUE THAT LIARS WHO START YOUNG OFTEN INDUP WITH PSYCHO LOGICAL IN SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE SORT THAT CHRISTINIA HAS TIMISTRATEED OVER THE PAST YEAR HOW LUCKY FOR YOU AND CHRISTINIA THAT SHE HAS ACCESS TO CSYCHOTHERAPY THROUGH YOUR PRACTICE NO    AN DEAR MONICA I NEVER EXPECTED SO MUCH DEFENSIVENESS WHEN I WROTE MY ORIGINAL LETTER PERHAPS YOU MISS READ IT ALL I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT I UNDERSTAND WHY A GIRL AND FATIMA'S PYSICI N AND ONE WITH HER BACKGROUND WOULD MAKE UP SUCH STORIES IT'S HARD TO GET ATTENTION IN A NEW PLACE THERE IS PROBABLY SOME PETTY JEALOUSY GOING ON BUT I THINK WE CAN RESOLVE THIS I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID THINGS AT FATIMA'S OLD SCHOOL IN FHRESNA WAS IT BUT HERE WE TRY TO HELP THE CHILDREN WORK THROUGH THEIR PROBLEMS WITHOUT GETTING TOO INVOLVED I SUPPOSE YOU ALREADY KNOW AND HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT CHRISTINIA WILL NOT ATTEND EMILY'S PARTY SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR ME TO ENCOURAGE HER TO PLAY NICE YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THAT HISTORY ALREADY SO I WON'T REHASHIT BUT I WILL SAY THAT IT WASN'T CHRICY'S FAULT THAT EMILY BROKE HER NOSE WHEN SHE FELT FINALLY AND I SAY THIS RESPECTFULLY BUT MAYBE IT WOULD BE WISE TO GO THROUGH FATIMA'S BACKPACK EVERY NIGHT INSTEAD OF ONCE IN A BLUE MOON I HAVE HEARD FROM MORE THAN ONE PARENT THAT IT SMELLS LIKE EGGS MY BEST DOCTOR LUCINDA JOHNSTON LICENSE THERAPIST AUTHOR OF TRAIN UP A CHILD DEAR LUCINDA OR SHOULD I SAY DOCTOR JOHNSTON I'D LIKE TO RESOLVE THIS AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD BUT THAT WON'T HAPPEN IF ALL YOUR LETTERS BEGIN IN END WITH BACK BITING I'M NOT OF THE MIND THAT THE ONLY TWO BLACK CHILDREN IN THE CLASH SHOULD BE INEMIES NOR DO I LIKE THE ATTENTION IT DRAWS TO THEM OR THEIR PARENTS WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY IN A DIFFICULT POSITION I WOULD THINK THAT A BLACK WOMAN OF YOUR STATURE AND SUCCESS WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW ISOLATING WORK IN SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS LIKE WESTWOOD CAN BE FOR PEOPLE LIKE US I HOPED CHRISTINIA AN FATIMA COULD BE FRINDS AND COULD SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN THIS SPACE BUT IT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE SECOND GRAT THAT YOU AND CHRISTINIA ARE NOT WILLING TO MAKE THAT WORK I'M SURE FATIMA WOULD LET CHRISTINIA INTO HER GROWING INNER CIRCLE EVEN HER AFTER SCHOOL READING CLUB IF CHRISTINIA WOULD ONLY APOLOGIZE AND BEHAVE JEALOUSY CAN BECOME A LIFELONG PROBLEM ON THAT NOTE I HATE TO BRING THIS UP NOW BUT WE WERE SURPRISE BY HOW POORLY CHRISTINIA BEHAVED WHEN FAR TIMA'S POEN ONE OVER HERS LAST YEAR I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T IN T WUTH A REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF THAT TANTRUM WHEN THE POETRY COMPETITION ROLS AROUND THIS YEAR ASKED WITH A HARD BOILED EGG WE RESOLVE THAT LAST BRING AND BOUGHT FATIMA ON NEW BACK PACK ATD I BELIEVE YOU KNEW THAT ALREADY JEARS DOCTOR MONICA WILLIS PH D AUTHOR OF EVERY VOICE COUNTS HELPING CHILDREN OF COLOR SUCCEEDD AN PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS MONICA EXCUSE THE INFORMAL NOTE I THINK YOU'RE DOING BOTH YOURSELF AND FATIMA A GREAT INJUSTICE BY CONTINUALLY EMPHASIZING HER BRILLIANCE OVER OTHER CHILDREN LOTS OF PEOPLE SGIP GRATES AND SKIPPING KINDERGARDEN ISN'T SOMETHING TO BRAG ABOUT I DOUBT THAT THE STANDARDS AT HER OLD SCHOOL WERE AS RIGOROUS AS THOSE AT WESTWOOD WHUT EXACTLY WAS SHE ADVANCED AT NAPTIME IF YOU'LL RECALL MOREOVER I WAS THERE AT THE RECITAL WHERE FATIMA READ HER A WORD WINNING POEM AND WHILE MY DOCTORITS YES PLOREL MAY NOT BE IN LITERATURE I'M PRETTY SURE HARDLY ANY ONE WOULD CALL BUTTERFLY PIE A WORK OF POETIC GENIUS YOU CAN'T RIME PIE WITH PIE MULTIPLE TIMES AND CALL THAT POETRY YOU JUST CAN'T EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE EXCUSE OF ONLY BEING IN FORTH GRATE ISN'T YOUR DEGREE BY THE WAY AND E D D LUCINDA LUCINDA I'M NOT SURPRISED IF FATIMA'S SUBTLE WORD PLAY WAS LOST ON YOU SINCE IT'S CLEAR READING PROBLEMS RUN IN THE FAMILY NOT EVERYONE IS SUITED FOR LITERARY WORK I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT FROM YOUR OWN WRITING STRUGGLES IN THE EXTR EFFORT YOU HAD TO PUT BEHIND YOUR RESEARCH IN ORDER FOR ANY ONE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY ISN'T THERE STILL SOME KIND OF ISSUE WITH YOUR LAST PROJECT AND THE I R B OR IS THE ISSUE WIT DOCTOR PARTALE'S EX WIFE MY VERY BEST MONICA MONICA I'M NOT GOING TO DIGNIFY MOST OF YOUR COMMENTS WITH A RESPONSE THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER BECAUSE I CAN SEE I'M NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE WITH YOU THERE'S SOME KIND OF BLOCKAGE THERE THAT I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD EXPLORE WITH A LICENSE

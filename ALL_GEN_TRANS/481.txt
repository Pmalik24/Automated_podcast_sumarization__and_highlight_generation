WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LA PONCANS S A SCIENCE SCIENCESPACE TO  ORI MANDEUR HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR JUSTIN SONINBERG DOCTOR SONINBERG IS A PROFESSOR OF MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMINOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERTS ON THE GUT MICROBIOM THE GUT MICROBIOM IS THE EXISTENCE OF TRILIANS OF LITTLE MICRO ORGANISMS THROUGHOUT YOUR GUT AND BY YOUR GUT I DON'T JUST MEAN YOUR STOMACH I MEAN YOUR ENTIRE DIGESTIVE TRACT TURNS OUT WE ALSO HAVIN MICROBIOM THAT EXISTS IN OUR NOSE IN ANY OTHER LOCATION IN WHICH OUR BODY INTERFACES WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN FACT THERE'S A MICROBIOM ON YOUR SKIN AND WHILE MIGHT SEEM KIND OF INTRUSIVE OR AND OF DISGUSTING TO HAVE ALL THESE LITTLE MICRO ORGANISMS THEY CAN BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL FOR OUR HEALTH MEANING OUR HARMONO HEALTH OUR BRAIN HEALTH AND OUR MEAN SYSTEM FUNCTIONE DOCTOR SNBERG TEACHES US ABOUT THE GUT MICROBIOM HOW ITS ORGANIZED SPACIALLY MEANING WHICH MICROBIOTO LIVE WHERE HE TEACHES US ABOUT THESE INCREDIBLE THINGS CALLED CRIPS AND NICHES WHICH ARE LITTLE CAVES WITHIN OUR DIGESTIVE TRACT THAT CERTAIN MICROBIOTO TAKE RESIDENCE AND AT THAT PROMERE REAL ESTATE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO INCREDIBLE THINGS TO SUPPORT OUR HEALTH HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO TO SUPPORT OR MICROBIO IN ORDER FOR OUR MICROBIOM TO SUPPORT OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH DOCTOR SONINBERG CORUNS HIS LABORATORY WITH HIS SPOUSE DOCTOR ERICO SONIBERG AND TOGETHER THEY'VE ALSO WRITTEN A TERRIFIC AND HIGHLY INFORMATIVE BOOK CALLED THE GOOD GUT TAKIN CONTROL OF YOUR WEIGHT YOUR MOOD AND YOUR LONG TERM HEALTH EVEN THOUGH THAT BOOK WAS WRITTEN A FEW YEARS BACK THE INFORMATION STILL HOLDS UP VERY NICELY AND TODAY HE ALSO BUILDS ON THAT INFORMATION INFORMING USC ABOUT RECENT STUDIES THAT FOR INSTANCE POINT TO THE IMPORTANT ROLL OF FERMENTED FOODS AND THE ROLE OF FIBER IN SUPPORTING A HEALTHY GUT MICROBIOM SO IF YOU HEARD ABOUT THE GUT MICROBIOM OR EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T TO DAY YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IT FROM ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERTS HE MAKES IT IMMENSELY CLEAR AS TO WHAT IT IS HOW EFUNCTIONS AND HOW TO SUPPORT IT FOR YOUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH DURING TODAY'S DISCUSSION WE DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT NUTRITION WE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF BEHAVIORS AND THE MICROBIOM BEHAVIOUR SUCH AS WHO YOU TOUCH WHO YOU KISS WHO YOU HUG WHETHER NOT YOU INTERACT WITH OR AVOID ANIMALS WHETHER NOT THOSE ANIMALS BELONG TO YOU OR WHETHER NOTHEY BELONG TO SOMEBODY EALTH IF ALL THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE ATE BAZAAR YOU'LL SOON UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR MICROBIOM IS CONSTANTLY BEING MODIFIED BY THE BEHAVIORAL INTERACTIONS THE NUTRITIONAL INTERACTIONS AND INDEED YOUR MOOD AND INTERNAL REACTIONS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE SYSTEM EVERY ONE HAS ONE EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW HOW IT WORKS AND EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO OPTIMIZE IT AND TO DAY YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN ALL OF THAT FROM DOCRO SONIBERG BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCHROLD STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN AL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THEREASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL F MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PETASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THE'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR JUSTIN SONUMBERG JUSTIN THANK SO MUCH FOR BEENG HERE AN TO BE I AM A TRUE NOVICE WHEN IT COMES TO THE MICROBIOM SO I LIKE TO START OFF WITH A REALLY BASIC QUESTION TIS WHAT IS THE M ICROBIUM I IMAGINE LOTS OF LITTLE BUGS RUNNING ROUND IN MY GOT AND I DON'T QUITE LIKE THE IMAGE OF THAT BUT I'M AWARE THAT OR MICROBIUM CAN BE GOOD FOR US BUT WE CAN ALSO HAV AN UNHEALTHY MICROBIUM SO IFAR WERE TO LOOK AT THE MICROBAUM AT THE SCALE THAT I COULD SEE THE MEANINGFUL THINGS WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE YEH I MEAN THE ESSENTIALLY YOURE CORRECT A MEAN WE HAVE ALL O THESE LITTLE MICROGANISMS RUNNING ROUND IN OUR GUT I THINK YOU KOW JUST TA START OFF WITH CLARIFYING TERMINOLOGY A MICROBAIUM AND MICROBOTA QUIET OFTEN AR REFERRED TO ARE USED TO REFER TO OUR MICROBIAL COMMUNITY INTERCHANGEABLY AND ALL PROBABLY SWITCH BETWEEN THOSE TWO TERMS TO DAY THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE IS THAT THESE MICROBES ARE A NOT JUST IN OUR GOT BUT THERE ALL OVER OUR BODY THERE IN OUR NOSE THERE IN OUR MOUTHS HERE ON OUR SKIN AND A SO BASICALLY ANYWHERE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT CAN GET TO A IN OUR BODY WHICH INCLUDES INSIDE OUR DIGESTIVE TRACT OF COURSES WOU KNOW COLONIZE WITH WITH MICROBES AND A THE A VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ARE IN OUR DISTAL GUT IN OUR COLAN AND SO THIS IS THE GOT MICROBIOTER GOT MICROBIUM AND A THE AN DENSITY OF THIS COMMUNITY IS ASTOUNDING I MEAN IT REALLY IS A A IF YOU GET DOWN TO THE SCALE OF A YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO SEE INDIVIDUAL MICROBES A YOU KNOW YOU START OFF WITH A ZUMED OUT VIEU AND YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE OU KNO FEECAL MATERIAL THE DIGEST INSIDE THE THE GOT AND YOU ZUME IN AND YOU START TO YOU KNOW GET TO THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL AND SEE THE MICROBES THEY ARE JUST PACT YOU KNOW SIDE TO SIDE AND AND ITS SUPERDENTS BACTERAL COMMUNITY ALMOST LIKE A A BIOPHIM THEYYOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S JUST MADE UP OF MICROBES TO THE POINT WHERE A IT'S THOUGHT THAT OU KNOW ROUND THIRTY PER CENT A FECAL MATTER IS MICROBES THIRTY TO FIFTY PER CENT SO YOU KNW IT'S A IT'S AN INCREDIBLY DENSE MICROBAL COMMUNITY WERE TALKING OF A YOU KNOW A TRILIANS OF MICROBIAL SELVES AND ALL THOSE MICROBIAL SELES IF YOU START TO GET TO KNOW THEM AND SEE WHO THEY ARE A BREAK OUT IN THE GOT PROBABLY TO A HUNDREDS TO A THOUSAND SPECIES DEPENDING UPON HOW YOU TOFINE A A MICROBIAL SPECIES AND THEN E MOST OF THESE ARE BACTERIA  BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER LIFE FORMS THERE THERE ARE ARCEA WHICH ARE LITTLE MICROBES THETR BACTERIA LIKE BUT THER THEIR DIFFERENT A THERE ARE A YOU CARIOTES SO YOU KNOW A WE COMMONLY THINK OF OUCARIOTES IN THE GOT IS A AS YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE A A PARASITE BUT A THERE ARE YOU CARRIOTES THER FUNGI THERE ARE ALSO LITTLE VIRISES THERE ARE THESE BACTERIA FAGES THAT INFACT BACTERIAL SELVES AND SO A AND AND THOSE ACTUALLY OUTNUMBER THE BACTERIA TEN TO ONE SO THE'RE JUST EVERYWHERE THERE THEY KILLBACTERIA A AND SO THER THIRSIES REALLY INTERESTING CREDITOR PREY INER ACTIONS BUT A OVER ALL ITS JUST AS REALLY DENSE COMPLEX DYNAMIC ECO SYSTEM AND AND SO YOU KNOW WERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE HUMAN AS A SINGLE SPECIES BUT WERE ALSO THINKING OF THE HUMAN AS THIS COMPLEX INEGRATED ECO SYSTEM OF HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF SPECIES INTERACTING AND CONCERT TO DO ALL THE FANTASTIC THINGS THAT WE KNOW HAPPEN IN THE HUMAN BODY AMAZING S WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CARGO TO R MAY BE WERE THE CARGOYE OS YE I MEAN THERE THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE LIKEIN A HUMAN STOJUST A REALLY ELABORATE CULTURING FLASK FOR MICROBES AND THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN DESIGNE OVER THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION A DESIGN TO A JUST A EFFICIENTLY PROPAGATE THIS MICROBIAL CULTURE FROM PERSON TO PERSON FROM GENERATIONTO GENERATION SO IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING OF THE HUMAN BODY INTERESTING I BELIEVE THAT OUR A P H WHERE THE TH P H OF OUR A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM VARIES AS YOU DESCEND AS YOU GO FROM MOUTH TO YOU KNOW TO THROAT AND STOMAC AND YOU SAID THAT MOST OF THE A MICROBIOTARE IN THE DISTAL COONE A ARE THEIR DISTINCT FORMS OF MICROBIOTO ALL ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT AND WITHIN THESE OTHERE A INTERFACES WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD TOTALLY YES SO IT STARTS LIKE WITH OUR TEETH IN IN OUR MOUTH AN SALIVA THERE'S A A ORAL MICROBIOTA A THESE MICROBIAL SPECIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE ONES E FIND IN THE DIGESTIVE TRACT THERE A USUALLY A YOU KNOW BUILT TO DEAL WITH OXYGEN VERY WELL THER YOU KNOW IN AN AREA THAT IS EXPOSED TO A LOT OF OXYGEN THEY OF COURSE SEE DIFFERENT NEUTRIANCS THAN FOR INCSTANCE E CALONIC BACTERIA WOULD SEE AN THEY GROW QUITE OFTEN AN IN MATS THAT LIVE YOU KNOW ON TEETH SO THERE THERE STRUCK THEIR VERY STRUCTURED IN TERMS OF AN A AND NOT A MOVING AROUND TA LOT SO THEY THEIR VERY FAIRLY STATIONARY AS YOU MOVE DOWN THE DIGEST AVTRACT THERE ARE MICRUBS IN AR SOPHAGUS IN OUR STOMACH BUT THOSE ARE YOU KNOW THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE ARE NOT VERY DENSE AND ACTUALLY NOT VERY WELL STUDIED WE KNOW OF A VERY A YOU KNOW THERE'S A VERY FAMOUS STOMACH BACTERIA KNOWN AS HELICOBACDOR PILORY WHICH A CAN CAUSE STOMACHULSERS AND CAUSE GASTRIC HANCER INSOMESOME A YOU KNOW A LESS FREQUENT SITUATIONS BUT THE A YOU KNOW THIS IS A A A VERY DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT SET OF MICRUBS T AFTO BE ADAPTED TO A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT IN THE STOMAC ESPECIALLY INCREDIBLY ACITIC ENVIRONMENT A BUT ALSO VERY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH OTHER MICRUBES JUST BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES AR LESS DENSE THEIR LESS DYNAMIC A THERE'S LESS NETRIENTS THAT STAY THERE AND PASSAGE THROUGH THE COMMUNITIE SO THE ALOT OFTIMES THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE RELIANT UPON NEUTRIENS DERIVED FROM THE HO ST AS OPPOSED TO NUTRIENTS DERIVED FROM OUR DIET AS YOU MOVE DOWN OUT OF THE STOMACH INTO THE SMALL IN TESTAN YOU START TO SEE THESE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT ARE BECOMING MORE WELL STUDIED A SMALL AN TESTHAN IS STILL A BIT OF A BLACK BOX JUST BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO ACCESS AND SO THERE SOME REALLY COAL TECHNOLOGIES OUT THEREFOR USING FOR INSTANCE CAPSILS TO DO SAMPLING AS THE CAPSUL PASSES THROUGH THE DIGESTIVE TRACTSO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SMALL INTESTON AND THEN YOU GET TO TE COIN AND THIS IS THE COMMUNITY THAT IS SO INCREDIBLY OU KNO DENSELY PACKED A DOING A TONI THAT THERE'S A TONOMETABOLIC ACTIVITY HAPPENING THERE ND A A BUNCH OF INTERACTION WITH THE HOST AND THAT'S THE STUDY THAT'S THE AM  COMMUNITY THAT'S REALLY THE BEST STUDIED PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE STOOL IS SO EASY TO OBTAIN COMPARED TO FERENCE AND SOMETHING IN THE STOMACH OR SMALL IN TESTON AND THAT STOOL IS FAIRLY REPRESENTATIVE WE KNOW FROM STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE USING COLONOSCAPIES AND SO FORTH STOOL IS FAIRLY REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COLAND SO A DENSE SUPEREXCITING COMMUNITY BUT ALSO THE BEST STUDY JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE THE EASIEST TO ACCESS IN A LOWER DIGESTIVE TRACK VERY INTERESTING A I IMAGINE THESE MICROBIOTO HAVE TO GET IN THERE AT SOME POINT OR MICRO BIOTA SEEN IN NEWBORNS A IN OTHER WORDS WHERE DO THEY COME FROM AND DARE I ASK A WHAT DIRECTION TO THE ENTER THE BODY YEER IS IT FROR MULTIBLE DIRECTIONS YE YAT GREAT QUESTION SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BURNING QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN COME BACK TO T THE INTO THIS AS WHERE IS OUR MICROBIO TO COME FROM BECAUSE IT IS THIS KIND OF OU KNO EXESTENTIAL QUESTION IN THE FEELD LIKE WHERE WHERE IS THIS COMMUNITY ASSEMBLING FROM AND THE THE REASON THAT IT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING QUESTION IS THAT A YOU KNOW A FEETUS WHEN IT'S IN THE WOMB IF THAT'S ACTUALLY A STERIL ENVIRONMENT A THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES THAT HAVE LOOKED AT A WHETHER THERE ARE MICROBES IN THE WOMB AND AND MICROB'S COLONING COLONIZING THE FEETUS AT THAT POINT A THERE'S SOME DEBATE ABOUT THIS BUT OVER ALL IT LOOKS LIKE THATS NOT A BIG PART OF THE EQUATION OF MICROBIA COLONIZATION AND A SO EACH TIME AN INFANT IS BORN IT'S THIS NEW ECA SYSTEM IT'S LIKE AN ISLAND RISING UP OUT OF THE OCEAN THAT HAS NO SPECIES ON IT AND SUDDENLY THERE'S US LIKE LANDRUSH FOR YOU KNOW THIS OPEN TERRITORY AND AND SO THE YOU KNO WE KNOW THAT INFANTS GO THROUGH THIS REALLY COMPLEX PROCESS OF MICROBIOTAS ASSEMBLY OVER THE FIRST DAYS WEEK'S MONTE'S YEARS OF LIFE AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU GET INTO A SWITCHING TO SOLID FOOD TWO TO THREE YEARS OF AGE A THERE'S SOME CHANGES IN A CHILDHOOD ADOLESCANCE WORKING INTO A DULTHOOD BUT THAT FIRST YOU KNOW A ZERO TO A ONE YEAR IS A SUPER DYNAMIC TIME WITH REALLY A CAND OF SERIOTYPICAL DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN THE GOT MICROBIOTO THAT APPEAR TO A HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING WRONG AND TO A C SING PROBLEMS FOR INFANTS IN SOME INSTANCES BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU STEP AWAY FROM THAT EXTREME SIDE OF THINGS GOING WRONG THERE ALL ALSO WHERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TRAJECTORIES THAT DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS CAN TAKE BECAUSE ARE MICROBIOTA S SO MALUABLE AND SO PLASTIC AND THOSE TROJECTORIES CAN BE EFFECTED BY ALL SORTS OF FACTORS IN EARLY LIFE SO AN EXAMPLE IS WHETHER AN INFANT IS BORN BY SEA SECTION OR BORN VAGENALLY WE KNOW FROM A BEAUTIFUL WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE FIELD THAT A INFANTS THAT ARE BORNE BY SEA SECTION ACTUALLY HAVE A A GOT MICROBIOTA THAT LOOKS MOR LIKE HUMAN SKIN THEN IT DOES LIKE EITHER THE THAT THE BIRTH CANAL THE THE VIGINA MICROBIOTA OR A THE MOTHERS A STOOL MICROBIOTA BABIES THAT ARE BORN THROUGH THE BIRTH CANAL HAVE INITIAL COLONIZATION A VAGENAL MICROBES AND OF STOOL MICROBES FROM THEIR MOTHER AND SO JUST THESE FIRST DAYS WHETHER YOUR BORN BY SEA SECTION OR THROUGH OR THROUGH NATURAL CHILD BIRTH YOUR GOT MICROBIOTA LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT AND THEN COMPOUND ON TOP OF THAT WHETHER YOUR BREASTFED OR FORMULA FED WHETHER YOUR FAMILY HAS A PET OR DOESN'T HAVE A PET WHETHER YOUARE EX POSED TO ANABIOTICS A THER ALL THESE FACTORS THAT REALLY CAN CHANGE THAT DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS AND REALLY CHANGE YOUR MICROBUAL IDENTITY EVENTUALLY IN LIFE THE REASON THAT THIS IS A THAT THE FIELD IS PLAYING PAYING REALLY CLOSE ATTENTION THIS IND STUDYING THIS RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM ANIMAL STUDIES THAT DEPENDING UPON THE MICROBES THAT YOU GET EARLY IN LIFE YOU CAN SEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM OR METABOLISM OF AN ORGANISM OR OTHER PARTS THERE BIOLOGY INTOTALLY DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY SO WHAT MICROBES YOUR COLONIZED OR WITH EARLY IN LIFE CAN REALLY CHANGE YOUR BIOLOGY AND WE CAN COME BACK TO THAT LATER BU AWE SHOULD THE YOU KNOW THAT GETTING BACK TO THAT ORIGINAL QUESTION OF WHERE YOUR MICROBES COME FROM YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU ARE BORNE THROUGH YOUR MOTHER'S BIRTH CANAL OR EXPOSE TOR SKIN MICROBES THAT A LOT OF YOUR MICROBES WOULD COME FROM YOUR MOTHER BUT IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN CERTAINLY DETECT THAT SIGNAL WE CERTAINLY SEE MATERNAL MICROBES IN THE INFANT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF MICROBES THAT AR COMING FROM OTHER PLACES A SURFACES OTHER PEOPLE PERHAPS OTHER CAREGIVERS BUT PERHAPS A STRANGERS AS WELL SO WE ACQUIRE OUR MICROBES FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES THE FIRST ONES ARE ARE FROM OUR MOM OR FROM OUR CAREGIVERS FROM THE HOSPITAL BUT THEN WE ADD TO THAT TREMENDOUSLY OVER THE FIRST YEAR OR SO OF LIFE CREDBLE YOU EVEN SAID T A PETS SO IT A IVIKIDIN IF THERE'S A DOG IN THE HOME OR A PAROKEET IN THE HOME THAT CLEARLY THEY HAVE A MICROBIOM ALSO IN POTENTIALLY THE CHILD IS DERIVING MICROBIOTO SPECIES FROM FROM THOSE PETS EXACTLY AD SO THE YOU KNOW I THE A B S STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IF JUST LET THE PTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD AS A FACT OR AND WHETHER THAT CHANGES A YOU KNOW THE GROUP OF INFANTS THAT HAVE A PET TO LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE GROUP OF INFANTS A DON'T HAVE A PET AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT IS THE PET DOING TO CHANGE THOSE MICRUBES AND SOME OF IT IS PROBABLY ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING DIRECT MEMBERS OF THE MICROBIOTA ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WE A I HAVE A DOG THAT DOG A OCCASIONALLY WILL LICK MY MOUTH WITHOUT ME LIKE PAYING ATTENTION YOU KNOW AND THAT'S PROBABLY INTRODUCING MICRUBES A WE ELSO NOF THE A YOU KNOW PETZER ARE DOWN IN THE DIRT THERE YOU KNOW OUTSIDE THERE YOU KNOW THERE THERE BEING EXPOSED TO A LOT OF INVIRE MENTAL MICRUBES AND SO JUST A YOU KNOW PET SERVING AS A CONDO IT FOR A BUNCH OF MICRUBES THAT WE WOULDN'T OTHERWISE COME IN CONTACT WITH A IS A IS A POSSIBILITY AS WELL A WHAT WE WLL RETURN TO A PETS AND IN PARTICULAR YOUR DOG AN AMAZING DOG BY THEW I MET YOUR DOG JUST THE OTHER DAY AND I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF I DEPRY MYSELF AWAY FROM  HAVENEWS OR I HAVNT IN CRED WHAT WAS YOUR DOGS AN LOUIS LOUIS LOUIS PASTOR LOUISPASTEURA I ERIT A AMAZING DOG LET A PERSONALITY ON THE DOG A THE THE ISSUE THAT I I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY WONDERING IS WHAT WHAT IS A HEALTHY MICROBIUM AND WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT SUPPORTING WE WE HEAR THAT YOU NEED A HEALTHY MICROBIUM TO SUPPORT THE AMIUNE SYSTEM OR METABOLISM OR EVEN THA GOT BRAIN ACCESS HOW DO WE DEFINE A HEALTHY VERSIS A UNHEALTHY MICROBIUM SOME PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW THE UNHEALTHY MICROBIUMAS DISBIOSIS IS THE WORD THAT I ENCOUNTER IN THE LITERATURE BUT YOUVEN THAT THERE'E SO MANY SPECIES OF MICROBIOTA AND GIVEN THAT I THINK WE PROBABLY EACH HAVE A SIGNATURE PATTERN OF MICROBIOTA HOW DO E TOFIND HEALTHY VERSES UNHEALTHY MICROBOTA IS THERE A TEST FOR THIS AM LATER WILL TALK ABOUT TEGNOLOGIES FOR TESTING MICROBIOTA THERE LOT A COMPANIES NOW LOT PEOPLE SENDING STOOL SAMPLES IN THE MAL AM NEVER LOOK AT THE POSTAL SERVICE THE SAME WAY AGAIN BUT THERE IT'S OUT THERE AND IT'S GETTING ANALYZE IT SO HOW SHOULD I THINK ABOUT THIS I I CAN THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE HEARTRATE HEART RA VERYABILITY AH BE AM I A ALL SORTS OF METRICS OF HEALTH HOW SHOULD I THINK ABOUT THE MICROBIOTA HOW DO I KNOW IF MY MICROBIUM IS HEALTHY OR ON HEALTH YE IT'S IT'S A MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION RIGHT KNOW IN THE FIELD AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THAT AND I CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW A  THERE ARE SESSIONS AT CONFERENCES THERE REVIEW ARTICLES BEING COMMISSION THER ALL SORTS OF KIND OF THOUGHT PIECES ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW LIKE WHAT IS A HEALTHY MICROBITO WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT DEFINE IT AND YOU KNOW I THINK BEFORE DIVING INTO THIS THE IMPORTANT THING TE TO REALIZE IS IT'S A COMPLEX TOPIC A CONTEXT MATTERS A LOT WHAT'S HEALTHY FOR ONE PERSON OR ONE POPULATION MAY NOT BE HEALTHY FOR ANOTHER PERSON OR POPULATION AND A THE MICROBIOTA IS A MALLUABLE YOU KNOW IT'S PLASTIC IT CHANGE IS AM OR HUMAN BIOLOGY WHICH I THINK IS YOU KNOW HOW WE THINK ABOUT HEALTH QUITE OFTEN BE A MI AND YOU KNOW LONGGEVITY REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS HOW EVER YOU WANTED TO FIND IT AM IT'S CERTAINLY AM CAN' ACCOMMODATE A VARIETY OF CONFIGURATIONS OF GOT MYCROBIOTA AND WE DON'T HAVE AM A YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY HARD TO ENTANGLE AM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FACTORS OF WHAT WHAT COULD BE YOU KNO VERY HEALTHY VERSE IS A LITTLE BIT LESS HEALTHY AM SO IT SO I I WILL SAY THAT THERE'S NO SINGLE ANSWER THIS BUT THERE'S SOME REALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS AND AM PERHAPS THE BEST WAY TO ST OUR TOGUABOUT THIS IS TO GO BACK TO AM THE INCEPTION OF THE HUMAN MICROBIOM PROJECT WHICH WAS IS AM PROGRAMM THAT THAT AN AGE STARTED THE INVESTED THE LOT OF MONEY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND NINE FOR AM REALLY A PROPELLING THE A FIELD OF OFV GOT MYCROBIUM RESEARCH IT WAS A BECOMING EVIDENT AT THAT POINT THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST A CURIOSITY OF HUMAN BIOLOGY THAT IT WAS PROBABLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR HEALTH AND THEY HADDLE THIS WONDERFUL SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE HUMAN GENOM SEQUENCING AM PROJECT AND WITH THE HUMAN GENOM COMPLETED THAT POINT THEY STARTED TURNING THAT TECHNOLOGY TO SEEQUENCING OUR GOT MYCROBES AND YU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTECTUALIZE THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO AM DOCUMENT THE YOU KNOW COLLECTIVE GENOM OF OUR GOT MICROBES IS ON THE ORDER OF AM ONE HUNDRED TE FIVE HUNDRED TIMES LARGER THEN OR HUMAN GENO SO IT'S JUST IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF GENES SOS JUST THIS VAST NUMBER OF OF GENES AND THEN IF YOU START GETTING INTO SOME OF THE FINE VARIATION IT E KNO SCALES BY TEN TO A HUNDREDFOLD SO REALLY A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ORE TRYING TO DOCUMENT AND AND THE AND SO IT'S O OH IT WAS A WONDERFUL INVESTMENT AND IT CONTINUES TO PAY DEVIDENCE TO THIS DAY AM BUT ONE OF THEIR GOALS OF THAT PROJECT WAS TRITED TO FIND WHAT A HEALTHY MICROBIOM IS VERSES A DISEASE MICROBIUM AND DIFFERENT CONTECTS AND SO THEY STARTED A ENROLLING A BUNCH OF HEALTHY PEOPLE IN A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITH FOR INCANCE IN FLAMATORY BAL DISEASE AND OTHER DISEASES AM AND AND THE IDEA WAS LET'S LET'S DOCUMENT THOSE MICROBIUMS WHAT MYCROBES ARE THER WHAT GENES ARE THERE AND THEN WE CONSTART TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT WHAT OF THE COMMONALOTIES OF THE THE HEALTHY PEOPLE AN AND WHAT WE KNOW HOW HOW CAN THAT VAGO WRONG IN THESE DIFFERENT DISEASE STATES AND A YOU KNOW THEY THEY THERE WERE SOME ANSWERS FROM THAT BUT YOU AM THROUGH THOSE STUDIES WE REALLY STARTED TO GET THE IMAGE THAT THERE IS THIS TREMENDOUS INDIVIDUALOTY AND THE GOT MYCROBIUM AND A AND SO IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD TO A START DRAWING AM YOU KNOW CONCLUSIONS AFTER INITINAL PASS OF THAT PROJECT OF WHAT IS A HALTHY MYCROBUM BUT THE OTHER THING THAT WE STARTED TO REALIZE AT THE SAME TIME THERE WERE STUDIES GOING ON DOCUMENTING THAT GOT MICROBIUM OF AM TRADITIONAL POPULATIONS OF HUMAN'S HUNTER GATHERS A RURAL ACRICULTURAL POPULATIONS AND AM THOSE STUDIES WERE REALLY MINE BLOWING FROM THE PROSPECTIVE OF YOU KNOW ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY THEIRE LIVING VERY DIFFERENT LIFE STYLES AND THEIR MICROBIUM DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE A HEALTHY AMERICAN MICROBIUMS IT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE HEALTHY AMERICAN MICROBIUM IS HEALTHY BUT ONLY IN THE CONTECTS OF LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONSUMING WHAT'S CONSUMED HERE A OR IS IT THAT THERE IS A SUPERIOR MICROBIUM SIGNATURE SOMEWHERE IN OUR HISTORY OR OCCURRENTLY IN THE WORLD YE YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF OF A A BIG QUESTION RI NOW I THINK YOU KNOW A THTHERE'S A GREAT CROTE FROM DE CHANCKY THAT SAYS NOTHING IN BIOLOGY MAKE SENSE EXCEPT IN THE LIGHT OF EVOLUTION AND YOU KNOW THAT THESE TRADITIONAL POPULATIONS ARE ALL MODERN PEOPLE A LIVING ON THE PLANTED NOW BUT THEIR LIFE STYLE DOES REPRESENT A A YOU KNOW THE THE CLOSEST OPROXIMATION TO HOW ARE ANCESTORS A EARLY HUMANS LIVED AND AND SO THOSE MICROBIUMS AND NOW WE KNOW FROM SEQUENCING OF PALIOPHECIES THE MICROBIUM OF THESE TRADITIONAL POPULATIONS IS REPRESENTATIVE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MICROBIUM THAT WE EVOLVED WITH THAT THAT A POTENTIALLY SHAPED ARE HUMAN JOU KNOW AND SO ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD WE HAVE A A DIFFERENT MICROBIUM FROM TRADITIONAL POPULATIONS IN THAT MICROBUM IS WELL ADAPTED TO OUR CURRENT LIFE STYLE AND THEREFORE HEALTHY N THE CONTECT OF AN INDUSTRIALIZED SOCIETY AND THERE PROBABLY ARE ELEMENTS OF THAT THAT ARE TRUE A BUT ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT THIS IS AF MICROBIUM THAT'S GONE OFF THE RALS THAT IT IS A YOU KNOW DETERIORATING IN THE FACE OF ANOBIOTIC USE AND A A ALL THE A PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH A A INDUSTRIALIZED DIAT WESTERN DIA A AND THAT EVEN THOU THE HUMAN MICROBIUM A PROJECT DOCUMENTED THE MICROBIUM OF HEALTHY PEOPLE HEALTHY AMERICANS THAT WHAT THEY REALLY MAY HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTING THERE IS A PERTURBED MICROBIOTA THAT'S A REALLY PREDISPOSING PEOPLE TO A VARIETY OV INFLAMATORY IN METOBOLIC DISEASES IT REMINDS ME OF THE A AS A NERBIOLOGIST A  WAS WEANED IN THE IN THE LANDSCAPE OF SO CALLED CRITICAL PERIODS WHERE EARLY LIFE ENVIRONMENT A VERY STRONGLY SHAPES THE THE BRAIN AND SO MANY STUDIES WERE DONE ON ANIMALS RAISED IN TRADITIONAL CAGES WITH WATER BOTTLE AND OF FOOD MAY BE A FEW OTHER ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AND THEN PEOPLE CAME ALONG AND SAT WAIT NORMALLY THESE SPECIES IN THE WILD WOULD HAVE THINGS LIKE THINGS TO CLIMB OVER AND THINKS TO GO THROUGH AND YOU PROVIDE THOSE VERY BASIC ELEMENTS IN ALLISAND THE ARCHITECTURE OF NERAL CIRCUITS LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT AND YOU REALIZING YOU WERE STUDYING A DEPRIVED CONDITION A AND EARLIER YOU AVE SHE REFERRED TO IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY TO CRITICAL PERIODS FOR GOT MICROBIUM DEVELOPMENT A IS IT A FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE ARE CRITICAL PERIODS MEANING IF MY WHAT' SAY MIE WHAT'S AIMET AT ME IF MY IF A M GOT MICROBIUM WAS A DIS BIOTIC WE WAS OFF A EARLLY IN LIFE CAN I RESCUE THAT THROUGH PROPER CONDITIONS AND EXERCISE ORIS THERE'SE SOME SORT OF A FIXED PATTERN THAT CAN BE HARD FOR ME TO ESCAPE FROM YET THE THERE'S A BIG FIELD THAT'S EMERGING NOW THAT A YOU KNOW WE REFER TO AS KIND OF REPROGRAMMING THE GOT MICROBIUM AND YOU KOW I THINK IF WE WANT TA CONCEPTIONALIZED HUMANS AS IS AGGREGATE YOUHUMAN MICROBIAL BIOLOGY A YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF CRISPER IN THE ABILITY TO A A POTENTIALLY CHANGE OUR HUMAN GENOM AND WAYS THAT CORRECT AMGENETIC PROBLEMS A THAT'S A WONDERFUL TECHNOLOGY A AND AS CN HAVE PUT ON THE TABLE YOU KNOW GENETIC INGENEERING FOR CURING DISEAS BUT IT'S MUCH EASIER TO CHANGE GOT MICROBES FOR A PROBLEM JUST BECAUS THAT THAT COMMUNITY IS IS MALEABLE A THE ISSUE THAT I THINK  WERSE SEEING IN THE FIELD IS THAT A MICROBIUMS QUITE OFTEN WHETHER THEIR DISEASE OR HEALTHY EXISTENCE STABLE STATES THE KIND OF TEN TOWARDS THIS A WELL THAT HAS GRAVITY TO IT IN A IN A WAY BIOLOGICAL GRAVITY WHERE A IT'S REALLY HARD TO DISLODGE THAT COMMUNITY FROM THAT STATE SO EVEN INDIVIDUALS FOR INSTANCE THAT GET ANABIOTICS A YOU KNOW YOU A TAKEORALANOBOTICS THE COMMUNITY TAKES ITS HUGE HIT WE KNOW THE BUNCH OF MICROBES DI THE COMPOSITION CHANGES AND YOU KNAVTHAT REPRESENTS A PERIOD OF UNERABILITY WHERE PATHAGENCE CAN COME IN AND TAKE OVER IN CAUSED DISEAS BUT IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THE MICROBIOTA KIND OF WORKS ITS WAY BACK TO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT EXACTLY LIKE BUT SIMILAR TO THE PREANOBOTIC TREATMENT A WE KNOW AT DIETARY PERTURBATIONS A QUITE OFTEN YOU'LL SEE A REALLY RAPID CHANGE TO THE GOT MICROBIUM AND THEN THIS IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MEMORY WHERE IT SNAPS BACK TO THIS SOMETHING TIT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL STATE EVEN THOUGH THE DIET REMAINS DIFFERENT AND SO THERE'S IS INCREDIBLE REWE REFER TO AS RESILIENCE OF THE GOT MICROBIUM AND AND A RESISTANCE TO CHANGE OR AT LEAST RESISTANCE TO ESTABLISHING A NEW STABLE STATE SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S HOPELESS TO CHANGE AND UNHEALTHY MICROBIUM TO A A HEALTHY MICROBIUM BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT WE NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT A YOU KNOW RESTRUCTURING THESE COMMUNITIES IN WAYS WHERE WE CAN ACHIEVE A NEW STABLE STATE THAT WILL RESIST THE MICROBIA COMMUNITY GETTING PULLED BACK TO THAT ORIGINAL STATE AND IT MEAN A ONE OF THE REALLY CAN AVE SIMPLEST AND NICEST EXAMPLES A OF THIS IS  INEXPERIMENT THAT  WE PERFORMED A WITH WITH MICE WHERE WE YOU KNOW WE'RE FEEDING MICE OF NORMAL MALSE DIET A LOT OF NEUTRIENCE THERE FOR THE GOT MICROBIOT O THINGS LIKE DIETARY FIBRE AND A WE SWITCH THOSE MICE HALF THE MICE TO A ALOFIBRODIET AND WEARE BASICALLY ASKING THE QUESTION THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU SWITCH TO KIND OF A WESTERN LIKE DIET A LOW FIBRE HIGHER FAT DIET A WHAT HAPPENS TO THE GOT MICROBIOTA AND WE SAW THE MICROBIOUT O CHANGE AT LOST DIVERSITY IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SEE IN A IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INDUSTRIALIZED AND TRADITINAL POPULATIONS BUT WHEN WE BROUGHT BACK A HEALTHY DIET A LOT OF THE MICRBES RETURNED YOU KNOW IS FAIRLY YOU KNOW THET THERE WAS THIS KIND OF MEMORY WHERE IT WENT BACK TO VERY SIMILAR TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHEN WE PUT THE MICE ON A LOW FIBRE O HIGH FAT DIET AND THEN KEPT THEM ON THAT FRMULTIPLE GENERATIONS A WE SAW THIS PROGRESSIVE DETERIORATION OVER THE COURSE OF GENERATIONS WHERE BY THE FOURTH GENERATION THE GOT MICROBIUM WAS A YOU KNOW A FRACTION OF WHAT AD ORIGINALLY WAS LETS SAY THIRTY PER CENT OF THE SPECIES ONLY REMAINED A SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE SPECIES HAD GONE EXTINCT ER APPEARED TO HAVE GONE EXTINCT WE THEN PUT THOSE MICE BACK ON TO A HIGH FIBRA DIET AND WE DIDN'T SEE RECOVERY SO IN THAT CASE IT'S A A A SITUATION WHERE A NEW STABLE STATE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED A IN THAT CASE IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THOSE MICE DON'T ACTIALLY HAVE ACCESS TO THE MICROBES THEY'VE LOST AND WE ACTUALLY KNOW THAT WE DID A THE CONTROL EXPERIMENT OF A MICE ON A HIGH FIBRE DIET FOR FOUR GENERATIONS THEY MAINTAIN ALL THEIR MICROBES IF WE TAKE THOSE FOURTH GENERATION MICE WITH ALL THE DIVERSITY AND DO A FECL TRANSPLANT INTO THE MICE THAT HAD LOST THEIR MICROES BUT HAD BEEN RETURNED TO A HIGH FIBRA DIET ALL OF THE DIVERSITY WAS RECONSTITUTED SO IT WAS A YOU KNOW SO YOUR YOUR QUESTION OF LIKE HOW TO WE ESTABLISH NEW STABLE STATES HOW DO WE GET BACK TO A HALTHY MICROBIOT IF WE HAVE TAKEN A LOT O ANOBIOTICS ORE HAVE IT DETERIORATED MICROBIOTA IT'S PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF HAVING ACCESS TO THE RIGHT MICROBES AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT ACESS LOOKS LIKE IT MAY LOOK LIKE THE REPUTICS IN THE FUTURE THEIRE LOT OF COMPANI'S WORKING ON CREATING COCKTAILS OF HEALTHY MICROBES BUT IT WILL BE A COMBINATION OF ACCESS TO THE RIGHT MICROBES AND A NOURISHING THOSE MICROBES WITH THE THE PROPER DIET VERY INTERESTING THIS MULTY GENERATIONAL STUDY REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING THAT I WAS TOLD EARLY IN MY TRAINING WHICH WAS THAT A IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR A TRAIT TO EVOLVE BUT NOT A LONG TIME FOR TRAITS TO DEVILE EXACTLY WHICH IT GENERALLY A IS IT IS TRUE OF A HUMAN BEHAVIOR TOO O THE OM IDEFENDS AND WE CAN ALL DO BETTER NON THE LASS VERY INSO I HAVE A APUZZLE AR  A BIT OF A CONUNDERMENT UM AROUND THIS NOTION OF A SPECIES OF MICROBITO SOF THE IF THE P H IF THE ASK ACIDITY IS DIFFERS ALONG OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT BUT IS MORE OR LESS FIXED FOR A GIVEN LOCATION RIT OM UNLESS SOMETHING IS REALLY OFF THE P H OF THE STOMACH IS WITHIN A PARTICULAR RANGE IN THE THE THE INTESTIAN SO FORTH AND CERTAIN MICRBIO TO THRIVE IN AT A GIVEN STATION A GIVEN LOCATION ALONG THE THE DIGESTIVE TRACT AND THE P HES WERE FIXED UM MORE OR LESS I'M TRYING TO FINGURE OUT WHAT WHAT IS ALLOWING CERTAIN MICROBIODA TO STAY IN THE GIVEN LOCATION WHY DON'T THEY MIGRATE UP OR DOWN SO ARE THEY PH SENSITIVE AND THAT'S WHAT'S WHAT THEYRE SELECTING FOR ALONG THE TRACT AND A I'M ALSO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THESE CHANGES IN FOOD SO ROBOSTLY CHANGE THE MICROBIUM IT'S THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT ALMOST MAKES IT SOUND LIKE FOOD IS THE THE VARIABLE THAT'S GOING TO DICTATE THE QUALITY OF THE MICROBIUM ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THEIR OTHER FACTORS IS WELL AND THEN IN THE BACK OF MY MIND I  DON'T KNOW THAT I WANTASTIS QUESTION BUT I REALLY ONE ASKE HIS QUESTION WHICH IS WHERE ARE THEY IN THEIR EXACTLY AND WHY DON'T THEY ALL GET FLUSHED OUT A IF A THIRTY PERCENT OF A FEQUAL MATTER IS A MICRO BIOTA AM THEN WHERE ARE TEY LIVING ARE THEY IN ARE THEY ALONG THE THE LINING AN THE LITTLE MICROVILI OF THE INTESTIN AND WHAT ARE THEY ATTACHING TO AND AN INTERACTING WITH AND WE KNOW THEIRE NURONS IN THERE A WE ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE STOMACH OR THEIRE IS LOT OF WORK NOW BE DONE ON THE EGUT NURONS AND HOW THEY SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN AND SO FORTH BUT WHO ARE THEY TALKING TO INTERMIS OF THE THE HOST CELLS AND A BECAUSE IF IT'S JUST FROM FOOD I IMAGINE THAT THEY'RE IN THEIR HAVING THEIR GOOD TIME OR ERE NOT AND THEN SOME ARE GETTING FLUSHED OUT ERE NOT BUT HOWDOE THE CTUALLY STAY IN THERE YET WHORE THEY ATTACHING TO WHAT ARETHEY TALKING ABOUT WHERE THEY DOING FOR FUN AND SO FORTH YET YE SUPERT SUPERINTERESTING SO A I'LL COME BACK TO THE ATTACHMENT QUESTION AND KIND OF LIKE WHY THEY DON'T GET WASHED OUT TIS IS SUPERFASCINATING QUESTION AND A YOU KNOW I THINK YOURE YOUR A INITIAL POINT OF LIKE THE THE KIND OF REGINAL DIFFERENCES AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF PHYSIOLOGY BY A CHEMISTRY ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE GUT IS REALLY INTERESTING THERE CERTAINLY IS A PH GREDIEN ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE GUT THERE IS A ACTUALLY BY CARBONAT THAT SECRETED INTO THE SMALL INTESTIN TO TRYDE IN NEUTRALIZE STOMACH ASCID THE'RE ALSO IS BILE THAT'S SECRETED A THAT CREATES A A DIFFERENT CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT IN THEIR VILE LOVING BACTERIA THAT KIND OF LIVE IN THAT REGION OF THE GUT A AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE THERE ISN'T A NEUTREENT GREDIENT JUST BECAUSE AS FOOD LEAVES THE STOMACH IT A YOU KNONT A LOT OF THE SIMPLE NEUTRIENTS ARE ABSORBED AND SO YOU MIGHT SEE MICRUBS IN THE SMALL INTESTIN FOR INSTANCE THAT ARE BETTER IT CONSUMING SIMPLE SUGARS BUT YOU WON'T FIND MANY MICRUBS IN THE COLN LIKE THAT BECAUSE ALL THE SIMPLE SUGARS HAVE BEEN DEPLEATED AT THAT POINT A AND THEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS A BIG FACTOR AS WELL AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY ACTIVE IN THE SMALL INTESTAN A THE SMLL INTESTAN IS HIS REALLY INTERESTING CHALLENGE FOR THE HOST BECAUSE IT'S A TISSUE THAT'S BEEN YOU KNOW IT'S PURPOS IS MAINLY ABSORBETIVE AND SO THERE HAS TO BE FLOW OF A A LOT OF THINGS YOU KNOW A LOT OF NEUTRIENTS FRA THE LUMINAL CONTENTS IN TWO HOCELLS AND SO THAT MEANS THE BARRIER CAN'T BE AS FORTIFIED AND SO THE THE AMUNE SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY ACTIVE IN THE SMALL INTESTAN TO MAKE SURE THAT MICROBE'S ARNGETTINGS SO CLOSE IN IF THEY ARE GETTING CLOSE THERE'S A RESPONSE TO THEM TO PUT THEM BACK IN THEIR RIGHT LOCATION A SO THERE'S YOU KNOW A AND THEN YU KNOW A LONG THIS WHOLE KIND OF ARCHITECTURE OF THE GUT THERE'S THE LONGITUDINAL GRADIANCE A THINGS LIKE LIKE PEACH AND SO FORTH AND AND I SHOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW PEAGE STARTS TO DROP AGAIN IN THE COLAN BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE MICROBES ARE FERMENTING THINGS AND PRODUCING ACIDS AND SO YOU ACTUALLYENED UP WITH A YOU KNOW THAT THE PEGE STARTING TO DROP NOT AS LOW AS A STOMACH BUT STARTING TO DROP AGAIN IF THERE'S A LOT OF FIRMENTATION HAPPENING IN THE COLAN IN ADDITION YOU ALSO HAVE A GRADIENT FROM THE HOST SURFAS EPITHELIUM OUT TO THE THE MIDDLE OF THE GUT AND THAT IS LIKELY THE THE KEY FOR WHAT IS RETAINED IN THE GUT AND HOW THE COMMUNITY ISN'T WASHED OUT SO LINING THE GUT WE HAV EPITHELIAL SELVES IN THE SMALL INTESTIN THEIR LARGELY ABSORBTIVE A IN THE COLAN THERE'S A LOT OF MUCUS PRODUCTION AND WE SHAL ALSO SEE THIS IN THE SMALL INTESTAN AND THIS MUCUS LINING IS THIS A YOU KNOW SUBSTANCE THAT WE SECRETE LARGELY MADE OF CARBAL HYDRATE ACTUALLY AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO KEEP MICROBES IN THE RIGHT SPOT AND TO ALLOW NUTRIANTS AND WATER TO BE ABSORBED IN THE SMALL INTESTAN ENLARGENTESTAN AND SO IT'S IS MESH WORK THAT IS SUPOSE TO KEEP OUT LARGE THINGS LIKE BACTERIAN LETTEN SMALL THINGS LIKE LIKE NUTRIANTS A THAT MUCUS LAYER IS A IT TURNS OVER MORE SLOWLY THAN THE LUMINAL CONTENTS PASSING BY AND SO A IF A MICROBE LEARNS TO HOLD ON TO THAT MUCUS LAYER IT CAN ACTUALLY RESIST THE FLOW OF THE THE CONTENTS OF THE GUT AND SO THERE THERE'S A A MANY MICROBES IN THE GUT THAT ARE NOT JUST GOOD AT ATTACHING TOMUCUS BUT ALSO GOOD AT NIBBLING ON IT AT EATING IT AND YOU KNOW THER THESE BACTERIA LIKE ACROMANSE A MUCINIFLA MUCUS LOVING IT'S A ONE OF ITS MAIN THINGS IT DOES IS ACTUALLY EAT MUCUS IN THE GUT THAT'S ITS LIC STYLE AND AND SO THERE THERE'S YOU KNOW AN INCREDIBLE A GRADIENT OF A ACTIVITY FROM THE HOST TISSUE WORKING YOUR WAY OUT THE MIDDLE O THE GUT WHAT'S AMAZING IS SOME MICROBES ACTUALLY DO PENETRATE PASTIMUCUS AND THERE THESE INVAGINATIONS IN THE INTESTAN KNOWN AS CRIPS ACTUALLY WHERE THE STEMSELVES LIVE THAT PRODUCE THE APITHELIUM AND THERE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES THAT CAN FORM IN THOSE CRIPS AND WE DON'T KNOW COMPLETELY WHAT THEIR FUNCTION IS BUT WE'VE DONE SOME STUDIES THAT APPEAR TO INDICATE THAT IF YOU CAN LOCALIZE TO A CRIP YOU'VE HIT THE JACK POT IS A MICROBE FOR BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN DOMINANCE IN THE GUT SO IF YOU SIT IN THE CRIPT AND SOMETHING SIMILAR TO YOU ANOTHERE MICRO THAT SIMILAR YOU COMES INTO THE GUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY EXCLUDE THAT MICROB AND THE THINKING IS THAT IT CAN'T FINDEST SPOT TO RESES BEING WASHED OUT OF THE GOT SO THERE PROBABLY ARE THESE LITTLE NICHES CLOSE TO HOSE TISSUE IN THE MUCUS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR A FOR RESISTING GETTING WASHED OUT WITH HE WITH THE FLOW OF ALL THE CONTENTS INCREDIBLE THAT RAISES A QUESTION ABOUT TWO THINGS THAT ARE A REASONABLY POPULAR A ONE IS THIS NOTION OF CLEANSES A FROM EITHER DIRECTION PEOPLE WILL CONSUME THINGS BY MOUTH TO TRY IN CLEANS THERE DIGESTIVE TRACT AS THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF THIS  I'M NOT RECOMMENDING THIS THERE'S DIFFERING OPINIONS ON WHETHER NOTHISIS GOOD OR BAD AN THE OTHER IS A FASTING OR TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING A THE REASON A I ASK ABOUT TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING AS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AFTER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF FASTING THERE'S SOME A AUTO ABSORBTION OR A DIGESTION OF ONE'S OWN A DIGESTIVE TRACT THAT THEN GETS RENEWED IN OTHERWARDS YOU YOUR TESTEN IN SOME EC START EATING ITS OWN LINING TO SOME EXTENT IN THE ABSENCE OF FOOD SO WOULD WE KNOW ABOUT CLEANSES OH AND THAT I SUPPOSE THERE'S CLEANSES FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION TO RIGHT WHICH A LESS POPULAR BUT A I 'E NEVER RUN THI STITISTICS BUT I A BUT CERTAINLY EXIST OUT THERE A WHAT ARE WHAT'S THE IDEA ABOUT CLEANSES AND FASTING AS IT RELATES TO THE HEALTH OR THE DISPIOSIS OF THE MYCROBIODA YET YOU KNOW THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF HIGH QUALITY SCIENCE IN THIS ARIA AND SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO CONCLUDE WHETHER THESE ARE GOOD OR GOOD FOR HALTH OR BAT FOR HEALTH THE YOU KNOW I THINK THE THE FASTING YU KOW WE'RE IN A REALLY INTERESTING SITUATION IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DIGESTIVE TRACT IN THAT PROBABLY HAS TO DO WITH ARE A HIGHLY PROCESS DIET AND PERHAPS HAVING A MY CROBIOTO THAT FAIRLY PERTURBED AS WELL AND SO YOU KNOW A WHETHER DOING THINGS LIKE THIS ARE GOOD OR BAD A IT'S REALLY HARD TO DEFINED BECAUSE WE MAY BE STARTING OFF IN A FAIRLY BAD STATE ANYWAY THERE SO MANY DISEASES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH MEDABOLECCINDRUM AND FLAMATORY BAL DISEASE THET JUST PUT A MASSIVE PORTION OF THE POPULATION IN A VERY DIFFERENT CATEGORY THEN PEOPLE THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO I MAINTAIN HEALTH HOW DO I LIVE ALONG LIFE A FROM STARTING OFF AN WHAT WE CONSIDER A FAIRLY HEALTHY STATE AND SO THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW FASTING A AND AND A LOT OF OTHER THERAPIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE FIELD A YOU KNOW I THINK KEITOGENIC DET MAY BE KIND OF IN THIS CATEGORY AS WELL THERE CAN BE TREMENDOUS BENEFITS IN TERMS OF A THERE IMPACT IN THE CONTECTIVE METABOLIC CYNDROM AND FOR PEOPLE THAT AR BATTLING A YOU KNOW HEEPING A CONTINUAL BAD DIET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IT MAN ADHERENTS I THINK ONE OF THE PO ONE O THE REASONS FOR THE POPULARITY OF INTERMITTENT FASTING A TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING A AND SORT OF I EXWHAT AF THEY CALL THEM NOW AM EXCLUSION DIETS WHERE YOU ENTIRELY EXCLUDE MEAT OR ENTIRELY EXCLUDE PLANTS OR WHATEVER IT IT IS THE THAT ADHERENTE AS SOMETIMES EASIER IN THE ALL OR NONE AM AS NOBYLE JUST WE THING OF THIS GO NO GO CIRCUITRY IT'S HARDER TO MAKE A A DECISIONS A NEUANTS DECISIONS OFTEN ABOUT FOOD THAN IT IS TIGUS ELIMINATE ENTIRE CATEGORIES OF FOOD NOT EATING FOR MANY PEOPLE YET IS EASIER THAN EATING SMALLER PORTIONS YET AM YET YET YE   SOME OF IT I THINK IS NOR BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSOLUTELY AND WE'VE HAVE YOU KNOW GASTERON EUROLOGY FELLOWS IN OUR LAB THAT COMM IN IND WE KIND OF YOU KOW I THINK THAT TO KIND OF SLICE THROUGH THE NEW ONTES OF ALL THIS THERE'S A VERY SIMPLE RECIPE AND A REALLY WELL EXCEPTED A KIND OF BROAD DEFINITION OF WHAT A HEALTHY DIET IS EE NO KIND OF THE THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET PLANT BASE DIET A IS YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST A TON OF DATA THAT A PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF EUROPE AN ANCESTRY BUT THERE'S A IOU KNOW A PRETTY BROAD AXCEPTANCE THAT IF YOU EAT MOSTLY PLANTS FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT'S GOIN TO BE VERY HEALTHY TO THE POINT WHERE A YOU KNOW  A WONDERFUL COLLEAGUE OF OURS CHRISOPHER GARDENER WHOSE STUDY DIET A HIS WHOLE LIFE A TRING TO ESTABLISH WHAT A HEALTHY DIET AS AND PEOPLE WAS GIVING ADVICE AS ON GIVING ADVICE TO A A DIETICIAN WHO IS TRYING TO GET ALL THE RULES AF LIKE WHAT WHAT SHE SHOULD BE RECOMMENDING TO A PEOPLE THAT SHE DEALS WITH THAT ARE INTERESTED IN A HEALTHY DET AND SHE SAID SO THAT NUMBER ONE OM AN ESSAY PLANTBASE FIBR IS PROBABLY SUPERIMPORTANT AN THAT SHOULD BE YOU NO VERY HIGH ON THE LIST AND SHE GOES ON A NUMBER TO AN HE SAID STOP HE SAID IF PEOPLE DO NUMBER ONE WELL YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANY OTHER RULES I MEAN IT'S BASICALLY LIKE IF YOU CAN HAVE A HGH FIBER PLANT BASE DIET A FOR MOST PEOPLE AT LEAST YOU NOR TALKING ABOUT THE BUCKET OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY IN A HEALTHY STATE YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT OTHER THINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EAT TOO MUCH ME YOU CAN'T EAT TOO MANY SWEETS YOUVORTY EATIN A HUGE AMOUNT OF PLANTBAS FIBER YOUR GOT IS FULL YOUR KNOK IN TO BE HUNGRY A AND IN A KIND OF TAKES CARE OF WORRYING ABOUT WHAT SHOULD I EAT OR WHAT WHAT SHOULDN'T I JUST EAT A TUN OF WHOLE PLANT BEN A WHOLE GRAINS LIKEUNS A VEGETABLES A FRUIT THAT'S THAT'S HIGH FIBRA BASE NOT HIGHE COMPLETELY EXCLUDE MEAT AND FISH AND THER AND HE WAS SAYING LIKE YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAN HAVE THEIR OWN SPENDS ON TIS BUT I  I THINK THAT THE THE MAIN RULE IS JUST START OFF WITH YOU KNON'T A KIND HI GETS BACK TO TO MICHAEL PALLENS MONSHRA YOU KNOW  A EAT FOOD NOT TOO MUCH MOSTLY PLANTS I YOU KNOW I THINK IF YOU STICK WITH KIND OF THESE SIMPLE RULES AND DON'T OVERTHINK LIKE SHOULD I HAVE THIS MYOU KNOW CAN I EAT EGGS CAN I E YOU KNOW JUST KND OF STICK TO THESE SIMPLE RULES THAT MAKES IT VERY APPROACHABLE BUT I AGREE LIKE SO TESE GASTERONAUROLOGY FELLOWS THAT WE'VE HAD N OUR LOB SAY THAT THEY IT'S REALLY HARD WE WE KIND OF SAY TO THEM WHY WON'T YOU GIVE THIS DIETARY ADVICE IT'S REALLY WELL KNOWN AND THEY JUST SAID WHELE IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR DIET UNLESS YOU'RE DOING EITHER A A GO NO GO SORT OF THING LIKE A OR ELIMINATING SOMETHING SO YOU KNOW IF KCT CAROTS ARE GIVING YOU PROBLEMS DON'TY CURETS AND THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE EASY INSTRUCTION TO FOLLOW BUT A DOESN'T REALLY DEELD WITH THE RUTE PROBLEM OF WHY CAN'T YOU EAT CARETS BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EAT CARETS MOST PEOPLE CAN EAT CARETS AND A AND SO I SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE WE A YET WE WE WHEN W'RE WHEN WERE THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE A FASTING AND YOU KNOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT DIETARY REGIMES AND CLEANSES THAT PEOPLE DO A WE WE HAVE TO STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND I OCABLE WHAT WHAT ARE REALLY THE THE BIG HIGH LEVEL RULES THAT WE SHOULD TAKE HOME AND THEN IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS AND YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM IT'S GOOD TO GO TO AN EVIDENCE BASED METHOD WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY DATED TO BACK IT UP THE YOU KNOW THE THE DATA IN THE FEELD REALLY SHOWS THAT WITH LIKE FASTING A PARTICULARLY IF YOU GO TO LIKE ANIMALS THE HIBRNATE OR THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE THE'S REALLY EXTENDED FAST YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A A MICROBYO TO COME UP THAT'S AT THAT BLOOMS IN THE ABSENCE OF OF FOOD COMING IN THROUGH DIET A THAT'S REALLY GOOD I AT EATING MUCUS SO YOU HAVE A YOU KNOBACTERIA THAT'S THAT SPECIALIZE IN EATING NEU TRIENTS DERIVED FROM THE HOSE BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER NEU TRANCE TO LIVE ON NOW WHETHER THIS IS GOOD OR BAD WE DON'T KNOW BUT IT IT SEEMS LIKE A THE YOU KNOW CONSUMPTION OF MUCUS IN ACCESS IS A PROBLEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MYCROBES GETTING TOO CLOSE TO HOST TISSUE AND INSITING INFLAMMATION WHICH IS WHAT WE SEE AN ANIMAL MODELS WHEN WE DEPRIVE OF DIETARY FIBRE WE SEE THESE MUCUS UTILIZERS BECOME ABUNDANT AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS START TO COME ON SO SO FASTING SHORT TERM MIGHT BE FINE PROBABLY A YOU KNOTHERS DEFINLY BENEFITS THAT ARE SEEN METABOLICALLY AM IN TERMS OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR A LONG TERM HEALTH FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THAT GOT MICROBYOTA I WOULD SAY WE DON'T HAVE THA ANSWER TO THAT YET IN TERMS OF THE EA NO THE CLEANSES AND THE FLUSHES AND ALL THIS A PERSONALLY I I THINK IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA I MEAN WE KNOW THAT LIKE IF AS I YOU KOW IN STUDIES THAT ARE BEING DONE NOW TO RE PROGRAMM THAT GOT MICROBYOTO TO INSTALL A COMPLETELY NEW MICROBAL COMMUNITY THE FIRST STEP IS TO WASH AWAY THE RESIDENT MICROBIAL COMMUNITY THAT'S THERE SO IF YOU 'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ACQUIRING A REALLY GOOD MICROBITA AND YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT THEN THE THE FLESHING EVERYTHING OUT IS GREAT A OTHERWISE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS YOUR KIND OF LEAVING REBUILDING OF THE COMMUNITY TO CHANCE LIKE WHAT IS IT AND SO A YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT MICROBES ARE GING TO COLONIZE WHO'S GING TO TAKE UP SPACE AFTER YOU DO THIS FLESH OR CLEANS AND A YOU KNOW THAT I THINK IT'S A A LITTLE BIT LIKE PLAYING RUSSIAN RELET YOU MAY 'T UP WITH A A GOOD MICROBIAL COMMUNITY AND THERE AFTERWARDS YOU MAY NOT A YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE EATING WHILE YOU'RE DOING THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE COMUNITY AFTER YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THANK YOU FOR T A I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THESE KINDS OF ELIMINATION DIETS AND INTERMITTEN FASTING A SLASH TIME RESTRICTOF BEING SEEMS TO BE GETTING SOME TRACTION IN PART BECAUSE AT SOME LEVEL WE ARE ALL DOING THIS WHEN WE SLEEP WMOST OF US ARE NEATING WHELE WE SLEEP ANYWAY AND A ADJUSTING THE NUMBERS SEEMS A MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLUT WE HAVE A LOT OF COLLEGUES AT TAMFOR WHO I I KNOW HAPPEN TO FOLLOW THAT REGIMEN A OR AID TIME RESTRICTOF FEEDING REGIMEN BUT AM ALSO AM WHOS ALLOW THE MORE TRADITIONAL MEAL SPATING AS WELL OF COURSE THE ONE THINKS THAT I WONDER ABOUT AS WE TALK ABOUT A PRIMARILY PLANT BASED WITH SOME IN WHAT D YOU SAY THE PALLEN THING WAS IT WAS A EAT A MOSTLY PLANTS A AND THEN MAY BE SOME MEAT BUT NOT TOO MUCH OR YOR NOT TOO MUCH EAT FOOD MOSTLY PLANTS NOT TO GOT IT IRST AREM EAT FOOD NOT TOO MUCH MOSTLY PLA GOT IT  YOU KNOW AN A IN A JUST I I HEAR THIS AGAIN AN AGAIN I KNOW A THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DO SEEM TO DO WELL ON A LOWER CARBO HYDRATE A YOU KNOW NOT EVEN SOME PEOPLE REPORT FEELING MUCH BETTER ON A LIKE REALLY STRICTLY ALMOST MEAT ORGAN ONLY DIET AND THERE ARE ONLY REASON I RASE THIS IS NOT I DON'T PRETOSPATEA  THE OMAN NOT ONE N OF THOSE A OMNIVORS A A THAT OUT THERE A I DO EAT SOME MEAT A AND I DO EAT PLANTS AS WELL BUT THE REASON I RAISIS IS EARLI YOURE TALKING ABOUT AM COMMUNITIES THAT MAY HAVE MICROBIOTA THAT ARE AM HEALTHIER THAN OURS ARE AT LEAST DIFFERENT THAN OURS AND THERE ARE COMMUNITIES IN THE WORLD THAT A THAT SUBSISTS LARGELY ON ANIMAL PRODUCTS OR FOR WHICH UNPROCESSED ANIMAL PRODUCTS ARE CONSIDERED THE RICHEST NEUTRINT FOODS IN THOSE CMMUNITIES PROTINE IS VERY SCARCE IN A ANCESTRALLY PROTINEAS WAS MORE SCARCE SO EGGS AN MEATIN THINGS THAT SORT SO COULD THERE BE A GONATIC COMPONENT IN OTHER WORDS IF WE FAST FORWARD TEN YEARS AND WE ACTUALLY CAN MAKE SENSE OF ALL THIS HUMAN GENOME STUP ARE WE GOIN TO FIND THAT SOME ONE WHO HAS A SCANINAVIAN A ROOTS OR SOMEBODY VAS SOUTH AMERICAN ROOTS OR SOMEBODY A DESCENDED FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBE WELL DO BETTER ON ONE PARTYULA DIAVERSES ANOTHER AND THEREBY WHERE I SHOULD SAY AND IN PARALLEL WITH THAT THAT THEY'RE GOT MICROBYOUM WILL HAVE DIFFERENT SIGNATURES THAT AR SO YOUR MICROBYUM MIGHT THRIVE ON PLANTS AND MINE MIGH THRIVE ON ORGAN METS AND AS I SAY THIS A I'M NOT OF BE CONSUMER OF ORGAN MEATS OB JUST LAYING THIS OUT FOR SAKE OF EXAMPLE YET I YET GREAT A SO A A FEW NOTES A THE FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE CARBOAL HYDRATES AND RESTRICTION OF CARBOAL HYDRATES AND SOME PEOPLE FEELING HEALTHIER WHEN THE THE COT CARBA HYDRATES OUT MY GUESS IS  THIS I THIS IS MY THEORY A TO BETESTED A THAT PEOPLE FEEL BETTER CUTTING CARBOAL HYDRATES OUT BECAUSE THE DIET THAT WE EAT IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN INDUSTRIALIZE COUNTRIES THE CARBAL HYDRATES ARE LARGELY CRAP PRIYES THERE PROCESS THERE IT'S LIKE STARGE IMPLE SUGAR AMIT'S THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO GLYCEMIC AN DECTS IT'S IT'S THESE SUGARS THAT THAT WE EAT THEY MAKE IT TO OUR SMALL ANTESTIN THEY GET CHOPPED UP INTO SIMPLE SUGARS ABSORBED INTO OUR BLOOD STREAM AND WE HAVE A TON OF GLUCOST THAN COURSING THROUGHOUR VEINS WHICH WE KNOW IS BAD AND CAN LEAD TO THINGS LIKE DIABETES A IF THE CAR THE CARBAL HYDRATES THAT WERE IN OUR DIET WERE COMPLEX CARBAL HYDRATES DIETARY FIBER AND WE LIKE TO REFER TO THE SUBSET OF DIETARY FIBRE THAT THE MICROBIOTA CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS AS MICROBIOTA ACCESSIBLE CARBOAL HYDRATES AND THE REASON THAT WE LIKE THAT TERM IS THAT HAS THE WORD CARBOAL HYDRATE AND IT AND IT'S A TO POINT OUT THAT NOT ALL CARBS OR BAD IT'S JUST THERE ARE BAD CARBS OR CARBS THAT ARE BAD IF YOU CONSUME THEM IN TOO HIGH A QUANTITY THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW A TABLE SUGAR AND SIMPLE STARCHES BUT THERE ARE GOOD CARBS AS WELL IN THESE MICROBIOTO ACCESSIBLE CARBAL HYDRATES ARE THE COMPLEX ONES THAT WE CAN'T DIGEST AND FUEL A ARE GOT MICROBIOTAR GOT MICROBITO CAN FORMENT THEM AND A SO THE YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK A WE PROBABLY ALL WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH LESS OF THE CARS THAT WERE TYPICALLY SERVED BUT MOST OF US AND PROBABLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WOULD BE BETTER OFF BY CONSUMING A LOT MORE CARBS THAT WERE COMPLEX THAT WERE MICROBIOTO ACCESSIBLE A IT ALL COME BACK TO WHY THAT' S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF OUR BIOLOGY THEIRE SOME MECHANISMS THAT ARE KNOWN AS TO WHY THOSE COMPLEX CARBAL HYDRATES ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR HEALTH FOR MOST OF US A I THINK THIS ASPECT OF HUMAN GENETIC ADAPTATION TO DIET IS SUPERINTERESTING AND THEN LAYER ON TOP OF THAT GOT MICROBIOTA ADAPTATION TO DIET WHICH IS ANOTHER LAYER OF THIS THAT A IS ALSO FASCINATING IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT OVER VERY SHORT PERIODS OF TIME HUMANS CAN ADAPT TO DIFFERENCES IN THEIR DIET LACTASTE PERSISTENCE AS KIND OF THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THIS JUST OVER THE PAST TEN THOUSAND YEARS A HUMANS YOU KNOW CERTAIN GROUPS OF HUMANS HAVE ADAPTED TO BEING ABLE TO CONSUME DAIR A BY TAKING THIS ENZIM LACK TASTE THAT NORMALLYES JUST EXPRESSED AND MOST THE WORLD'S POPULATION EARLY IN LIFE TO BE BE ABLE TO METABOLIZE LACTOS IN BREASTMILK A BY EXTENDING THE EXPRESSION OF THAT THROUGHOUT LIFE NOW YOU CAN CONSUME MILK FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND SO THAT IS AN EXAMPLE EOF SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF HUMANS A HUMAN GENO GENETICALLY ADAPTING TO DIET IN A VERY SHORT PRID OF TIME AND THIS THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF THIS AND UNDOUBTEDLY THIS HAS HAPPENED A THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DIET SO CERTAINLY AMIDS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENT DIETS BETTER BETTER FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS BASED ON WHAT GENES YOU YOU HARBOR AND HAVEN YOUR IN YOUR HUMAN GENO THE OTHER ASPECT ON TOP OF THAT IS THAT A YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE A GOOD EXAMPLES A OF THE GOT MICROBIUM ADAPTING TO CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN DIET AND THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE DEGRADATION OF SEAWEED SO WE KNOW THAT A MOST AMERICANS IF FOU EAT SUCI AND AND THERE'S NORY THERE I YOU YOU EAT A SOME OF THIS THE SEAWEED IT HAS A DIETARY FIBR IN IT NOTICE PORPHYRAN THAT PORPHYRAN WILL SHOOT THROUGH MOST OF US UNTRANSFORMED INERT SUBSTANCE IT YOU KOW IT'LL DO OTHER THINGS LIKE RETAIN WATER AN SERVICE KIND OF SOMETHING LIKE CELULUS NOT BE AFERMENTED AT A HIGH LEVEL A IF SOMEBODY FROM SOUTH EAST ASIA THAT'S ALWAYS CONSUMED A SEAWEED AND IS PART OF A CULTURE THAT CONSUME SEAWEED EAT SEAWEED THEY HAVE A GOT MICROBE THAT CAN NOW METABOLIZED PORPHYRAN AND SO THERE THESE VERY SPECIFIC GENE TRANTS FOR EVENTS WHERE THE GENES FOR BREAKING DOWN PORPHYRAND HAVE BEEN IMPORTED INTO THE MICROBIUM OF MANY PEOPLE IN SOUTH EASTASIA TO A YU KNW WE CAN THINK OF IT AS HELPING DIGEST PORPHYRAN BUT IT'S REALLY JUST A MICROBE THAT'S FOUND AD NISH FOUND A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING IN THE GOT BY CONSUMING SOMETHING THAT'S COMMON IN THE DIET THERE SO THERE ARE THESE DIFFERENT LAYERS ARE HUMAN GENETICADAPTATIONS AND THERE ARE MICROBIOMADAPTATIONS THAT ARE CULTURAL AND AND BASED ON PEOPLES GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION A BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NO ESCAPING THE FACT THAT FOR MUCH OF HUMAN EVOLUTION THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THIS PLANET HAD ANCESTORS THAT WERE HUNDR GATHERERS FORGING CONSUMING HUGE QUANTITIES OF PLANT MATERIAL JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WAS THERE AND SO ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT WE STUDY THE HODZA HUNTER GATHERERS IN AFRICA A AND I I SHOULD OBTAKE A MOMENT JUST TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW  ARE RESEARCH AND AND RESEARCH OF MANY PEOPLE IN OUR FIELD IN OTHER FIELDS RELY ON STUDY OF INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO A THINK OF THESE COMMUNITIES AS A YOU KNOW ARE EQUALS THER MODERNPEOPLE ON THE PLANET THEY HAVE INTERESTING LIFE STYLES THAT ARE IN FORMATIVE WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OF HUMAN BIOLOGY A BUT IN MANY CASES THEY ALSO ARE A YOU KNOW LEADING A VUNERABLE EXISTENCE AND SO WE REALLY TAKE GREAT CARE IN OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM IN ITS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT A YOU KNOW THESE POPULATIONSE TAKE PARTINER RESEARCH BECAUSE THEIRE WONDERFUL RESEARCH PARTNERS AN WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF KIND OF THINKING ABOUT HOW A YET BOTH WE TALK ABOUT THEM AND USE OUR DATA THATHAT IS A BEEN GAINED THROUGH THER ABGENDEROUS CONTRIBUTION TO OUR RECENTPOPEN THE HODSA HUNDRED GATHERERS HAT'S ESTIMATED CONSUME ON THE ORDER OF A HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED FIFTY GRAMS OF DIETARY FIBRA PER DAY AND THAT'S IN START CONTRAST TO THE TYPICAL AMERICAN THAT CONSUMES ABOUT FIFTEEN GRAMS SO SOMEWHERE TENT SEVEN TO TENFOLD DECREASE IN THE MAIN NEUTRIANT THAT FEEDS ARE GOT MICROBIUM IN THE AMERICAN DIET THE THE HODZA ARE A YOU KNOW ONE EXAMPLE THEIR DIFFERMANY DIFFERENT FORGING POPULATIONS BUT THE VAST MAJORITY THESE POPULATIONS CONSUME HUGE AMOUNTS OF DIETARY FIBRE BECAUSE PLANTS ARE THE RELIABLE CONSISTENT SOURCEAT YOU KNOW IF YOU AS E A HUNTER GATHER GO ON A HUNT YUSUALLY THAT HUNT IS UNSUCCESSFUL YOU KNOW I THINK THE DATAR THAT YU O ONE OUT OF TWENTY TO THIRTY HUNTS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN LANDING ACTUALLY BIG GAME FOR THE HODZA THEY HAVE A O BIRDS THAT THEY SHOOT AND SMALL ANIMALS BUT QUITE OFTEN A DAY AFTER DAY THEIR RELYING UPON A BURIES TOBIRS BAYOBOB FRUITS YOU KNOW THEYARE THEY RELYING ON THE PLANTS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND ACTUALLY FOU A YOU GO TO THE DATE AND LOOK AT WHAT THEIR FOOD FOOD PREFERENCES ARE THEIR FOOD PREFERENCES ARE ACTUALLY MEAT AND HONEY SO THEY DON'T EAT A HIGH FIBRE DIET BECAUSE THEY LOVE FIBR THEY AT A HIGH FIBR DIET BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND CONSISTENT A FOR THEM TO TO SURVIVE BUT YOU KNOW OUR BRAINS ARE WIRED FOR COLOR DENSITY AND SO IF YOU TOOK A A HODSAND PUT THEM IN A RESTAURANT IN THE UNITED STATES THEY WOULD MAKE THE SAME CRAPPY DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW ALL WANT SUGAR AND FAT AND COWLORIES AT HOWER OUR BRAIN IS WIRED AND PROTING AND FAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AS FAR AS WE KNOW ALRIGHT SO THAT SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THE HODZI HOPE IN PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY YO YOU SAID WOULD PREFER TO EAT MEAT AND HONEY BUT THEY DO THEY HAPPEN TO CONSUME A LOT OF PLANT FIBRE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHON'S AVAILABLE THE A ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I I HAVE AS IT RELATES AM TO ALL OF THIS IS IT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERE IS NO QUESTION FROM THE PUREVYAND ALL THE WAY TO THE EDREAM OPPOSITE WHICH YOUD BE PURE MEAT DIET A THAT AVOIDING PROCESSED FOODS IS A GOOD IDEA YOU ARE HEAVILY PROCESS FOODS IN GENERAL AND EV NOT THAT YOU KNOW THE OCCASIONAL CONSUMPTION IS IS AM NECESSARILY BAD BUT I WHETHER NOT ONE IS THINKING ABOUT ONE MAKR NUTREN PROFILE OR ANOTHER IT SOUNDS LIKE CONSUMING PPROCESS FOODS IS JUST BAD FOR THE MICROBIOM CAN WE SAY THAT CATEGORICALLY FORSIR OYETWHETHER NOT YOU ALSO YOUR LOW CAR PERSON YOUR EUROCAR PERSON YOUR EXTREMELEGU AND NO MEAT WHETHER NOT YOUR ALL MEAT ORGAN MEAT SOUNDS TO ME AS IF A THE NUMBER ONE THING MAYBE EVEN DARE I SAY ABOVE CRISES A A POINT ABOUT PLANTS WITHOU NOCKIN CHALLENGE CRIS GARDENER ON ON UNTRITIAN I WOULD BE A WAY OUTSIDE THE LANE LINES TO DO THAT BUT IS THAT TO AVOIDING PROCESSED FOODS YET IS PARIM YAND I THINK THAT'S COMPLETELY COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT CHRISOPHERS SAYING HE WAS SAYING IF YOU PUT PRIORTIZES GETTING A HUGE AMOUNT OF OF WHOLE PLANTBASE FOOD WITH A LOT OF FIBRE FIRST YOU'RE NOTKING TO HAVE ROOM FOR EATING A LOT OF PROCESS YOT SO SO IT'S KIND OF THE SAME AS AVOIDING PROCESS FOOD SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE SAME RULE AND I THINK THAT YEUTHER YOUR EXACTLY RIGHT AN WE AN BREAK DOWN WHAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DATE OF WHIE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF PROCES FHOOTOR SO BAD FOR US AND SO BAD FOR OUR MICROBYUM AND I CAN TALK ABOUT A FEW EXAMPLES OF THAT BUT THE FLIPSIDE OF THIS IS THIS MECHANISM OF YOU KNOW  AND AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THE SPECTRUM OF A PLANNED BASE DIET FERSES OF MEAT BASE DIET A YOU KNOW THERE'S A A LOT OF DATED TO TELL US THAT A METER OR KEETOJENIC OR HIGH FAT DIET MAY HAVE BIG BENEFITS AND TERMS OF SHORT TERN METABOLIC HEALTH THAT'S TYPICALLY HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT DIET AF THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF HEART DISEASE THATS LINKED WITH THAT AS WELL THERE'S GOOD LITERATURE FOR THAT WHICH AS SOMETHING TO FOR PEOPLE TO TO LOOK OT AND BE AWARE OF THE PLANT BASE DIET IF YOU'RE EADING A BUNCH OF COMPLEX A YOU KNOW FIBRERS THAT FEED YOU'RE GOT MY CROBYOTO YOU'RE GOT MY CROBY TAPRODUCES THESE SUBSTANCES CALLED SHRT CHAINED FADIACIDS THINGS LIKE BUTERATE AND IT'S KNOWN THAT THESE SHORT CHAINED FAIACIDS PLAY REALLY ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS BOTH IN TERMS OF FUELING COLONISITES IN FORCING THE BARRIER OR KEEPING IN FLAMMATION LO REGULATING THE IMIAN SYSTEM REGULATING METABOLISM AND SO YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF DIETARY FIBRAS THAS INNER SUBSTANCE THAT PASSES THROUGH MAKES US FEEL FULL MAY BE FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT WE GET HUNGRY AFTERWARDS READOWAY IF YOU'RE EADING A LOT OF FIBR THAT'S FEEDING YOU'R GOT MY CROBYOTO YOU'RE GOT MY CROBYOTIS JUST PRODUCING THIS VAST ARRAY A FERMENTATION AND PRODUCTS THAT THEN GET ABSORBED INTO OUR BLOOD STREAM AND HAVE ALL OF THESE TREMENDOUS CASCATING EFFECTS THAT APPEAR TO BE LARGELY BENEFICIAL ON OUR BIOLOGY AND SO TO THINK ABOUT THAT PARADIME OF SIMPLE CARBS VERSES COMPLEX CARBS IN THE CASE OF SIMPLE CARBS YOU AND UP WITH HIGH BLOOD SUGAR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WILL SPITE YOUR INSOLENT AND YOU KNOW HAVE ALL KINDS OF WEIRD METABOLIC EFFECTS IN THE CASE OF COMPLEX CARBAL HYDRATES YOU'LL LEND UP WITH VERY LOW BLOOD SUGAR BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE HAVE LOW GLYCEMIC INDECTS AND A BUNCH OF SHORT CHAINE FADIACIDS THAT AR HAVING REGULATORY RAL SO SO JUST A TO ROUND OUT THAT THAT TOPIC I THINK THERE IS A REASON TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ABSOLUTELY EVERY ONE OUT THERE BUT I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE STATISTICS OF WHAT WE KNOW PEOPLE EAT IN THE UNITED STATES AND AN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES MOST PEOPLE WULD RE TREMENDOUS HEALTH BHENEFITS FROM EATING MORE WHOLE PLANTBASE DIETARY FIBR KNOW PROCESS FOODS I THINK IS THIS OTHER DIMENSION WE HAVE ALL OF THESE WEIRD CHEMICALS ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS WEIRD FATS A YOU KNOW LOT OF REFINE SIMPLE NEUTRIANTS THE SIMPLE NUTRIANS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BUT WE KNOW THAT FOR INSTANCE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS CAN HAVE A MASSIVE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEY GOT MY CROBUM AND CAN LEAD US TOWARDS METABOLIC SENDROMACTUALLY THERE'S BEEN BEAUTIFUL WORK OUT OF THE WISESMEN INSTITUTE ON THIS AND THEY KOW EMMULSIFIERS THESE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE PUT IN PROCES FOODS TO HELP THEM MAINTAIN SHELF SUBSTABILITIES SO THINGS DON'T SEPARADE AND SO A YOU KNOW ALL THE THE MOISTURE CONTENT IS RETAINED APPROPRIATELY A MANY OF THESE ARE KNOWN TO DISRRUPT THE MUCASLAYER AND AS SOON AS YOU START DISRUPTING THAT BARRIER THAT CAN LEAD YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF INFLAMMATION AND IN ANIMAL MODELS WE KNOW THAT CAN LEAD TOWARDS METABOLIC CENDEROM IS WELL SO THERES THERE'S COMPONENTS OF PROCESS FOOD THETTER WHEN STUDIED AN ISOLATION KNOWN TO HAVE A DIRECT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GOT BIOLOGY IN THE MICROBIOTA THE MENTION OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS IS IS INTERESTING IT I I CONFESS I IT'S A THIRD RAIL ON SOCIAL TALKING OUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THEIR TWO CAMPS IT SEEMS OR AT LEAST AM TWO CAMPS ONE THAT SAY ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS ARE NOT DETRIMENTAL AT ALL ANOTHER THAT SAYS THER VERY DETRIMENTAL MAINLY BASED ON THE MOUTH STUDIES AND THAN THERE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLL THAT ARE I PUT MYSELF IN THAT CATEGORY I DURINK THE OCCASIONAL THA SODA I DON'T CONSUME THEM IN LARGE VOLUME BUT OF SORT IN THE THE MIDDLE THERE HOWEVER UM AND SO I JUST THROW THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE I KNOW IMMEDIATELY PEOPLES AM ARE JUMPING ON THAT BUT I LJUST MENTION THEIR SOME RECENT DATA FAUT OF AUM D'IGOBORIS LAB THAT DUKE UNIVERSIY THAT THE NURONS THAT LIVE IN THE GOT MECOSE OF THESE NUROPODZELLS CAN ACTUALLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL AND AM TRUE SWEET THE SUGAR VERSEIS ARTIFICIAL A SWEETNERS AM BASE THEY'D SEND DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF NERAL SIGNALS UP TO THE BRAIN AND THE BRAIN CIRCUITRY SEEMS STRONGLY IMPACTED SO I THINK AS THE DATA EMERGE WERE HEARING MORE MORE THESE ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS AM YEITHER ARE PROBLEMATIC OR AT LEAST ARE SIGNALLING DIFFERENT EVENTS IN IN THE GUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DISTINGUISH A ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS FROM NON COLORIC PLANT BASE SWEETENERS U AND THIS IS BASED ON MISTAKE THAT I'VE MADE OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THE POD CAST WHILE JUST KIND OF LUMP ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS UM INTO ONE BECATEGORY AND SAY AND THAT I'LL MENTION STEVE YA SO WHAT ABOUT PLANT BASE SWEETENERS THAT A NOT ARTIFICIAL THEY WEREN'T MANUFACTURED IN LABORATORY LIKE SACRON OR SUCRELOS OR ASPERTAME WHAT DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PLANT BASED NON COLORIC SWEETNERS ARE LOW COLORIC SWEETNERS THERE VERY LITTLE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE HAVE A A LOT MORE BANK FOR THE BUCK THERE THE'RE INCREDIBLY SWEET SOIT TAKES A REALLY SMALL AMOUNT FOR THEM TO TRIGGER A HUGE AMOUNT OF SWEETNESS AND A AND SO IT'S DEPENDING UPON THE MECHANISM OF ACTION BY WHICH THESE AM SWEETENERS THAT ARE NOT SUGAR AR IMPACTING ARE BIOLOGY IT MAY BE THAT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY UM YOU KNOW LESS NEGATIVE OR AR MORE HEALTHY THAN UM THE ONES THAT ARE RTIFICIAL JUST BECAUSE YOUR REQUIRES LESS OF THEM IN THE FOOD FOR US TO PERCEIVE THAT SWEET TASTE IT MAY ALSO BE THAT BECAUSE THERE OU KOW I DON'T THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS THAT'S NATURAL IS BETTER NECESSARILY THAN THINGS THAT ARE ARTIFICIAL  BUT IT MAY BE THAT BECAUSE OF AM YOU KNOW KIND OF EVOLUTIONARY EXPOSURE TO THESE COMPOUNDS IN OR DIET M HISTORICALLY THERE ARE I THINK TRADITIONAL POPULATIONS THAT USE THESE FOR INSTANCE TO SWEETEN UM YOU KNOW ASWEETEN DIFFERENT FOODS U THAT AR BODIES JUST CAN F KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THOSE COMPOUNDS BETTER THAN THE ONES THAT ARE SYNTHETIC M BUT I THINK THE MEAN  THE STUDYS STILL NEED TO BE DONE DO YOU ACTIVELY AVOID ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER SUCRELOS ASPERTAME SACRON YOU PERSONALLY YE YOU KNOW SO I I DO I I AVOID THEM BUT I'M NOT YOU KNOW A SO  AM I WORKE CLOSELY WITH MY WIFE ERICAAS YOU KNOW WE DO WE WERE IN THE LAB TOGETHER AND WE AM YOU KNOW WROTE THIS BOOK THE GOOD GOT WHERE WE KIND OF DOCUMENT OUR JOURNEY IN CHANGING ARE LIFE STYLE DIETARY HABITS CHOICES WE MAKE BASED ON THE RESEARCHAS WE'VE GOT TO KNOW IT IN THE GOT MY CROBIOT OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND AM YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT JUST I DOING THINGS I MODERATION MAKES IT A LOT A EASIER AND DOING THINGS SLOWLY MAKES IT A LOTEASIERE AND SO SO THERE VERY FEW RULES THAT I HAVE THAT ARE HARD AND FAST I'M I'M A PRETTY FLEXIBLE EATER I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HAVING AN ARTIFICIAL YO KNOW HAVING A DIEC COK AM WELL YOU KNOW SOMEHOW CASCADE INTO SOME TERRIBLE DISEASE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT A I I TRY TO AVOID THEM I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE FLAVOR OF THEM I'M I'M SUPERSENSITIVE TO THE THE NEW LANCES OF THE FLAVOR EVEN WITH THE EN OSTEVI AND MOGROSIDES FOM MON FRUD ENSTUFF LIKE THAT I JUST REALLY THE OW FLAVORS ARE REALLY HARD FOR ME TO DEAL WITH BUT AM SO SO BUT I ALSO IN THIS JOURNEY OF CHANGING OUR DIET LIKE WHEN WE STARTED OFF IN MY CROBIUM RESEARCH I WAS IN THE HABIT OF YOU KNOW IN THE AFTERNOONS HAVING A SWEET A MUFFIN OR A COOKY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHEN WE STARTED TO REALIZE THAT WEU KOW WE SHOULD BE EATING LESS SWEET SINCE EATING MORE DIETARY FIBR THIS WAS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CHANGE FOR ME TO MAKE I WAS JUST WIRED TO KIND OF CRAVE YOU KNOW THIS CLASSIC SCIENTIST YE EXIS IS LOF THE THE PESSURING THE AFTERNOON TOING COFFE YEI ALL DAYS IT USED TO BE A CIGARETTE TO RIGTN RIGHT EXACT WHEN I STARTED MY TRAINING THE LOT OF PEOPLE STILL SMOKE YET RIGHT AND IT WAS ONLY DURING MY POSTOCTRAL TRAINING THAT THEY ELIMINATE SMOKING ON CEMPASSES AND AND PRODUCTIVITY TOOK  TO A TROUGH FOR A WHI AND UNTIL THESE PEOPLE DEVELOPED OTHER TOOLS TO I TO FOCUS THEIR TANCHAT EXACTLY EXACTLY SO THERE THERE IS THIS KIND OF LIKE NEED AND THAT ONCE YOU HAVE AN IN GRAINE BEHAVIOR AND MA BE THINGS THAT ARE ADDICTIVE IT BECOMES INCREDIBLY IM DIFFICULT TO BREAK THAT HABIT AND A AND SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW GRADUALLY OVER THE COURSE OF LIKE YOU KNOW FIVE OR MORE YEARS WE HAVE A YOU KNOW MIGRATED OUR DIET A WAY FROM SWEET FOODS TO AM THINGS THAT AR OR LESS SWEET AM AM IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A JOURNEY IT'S BEEN A SLOW PROCESS A BUT WE'VE GOT INTO THE POINT NOW WHERE WE'VE JUST RETRAINED OUR PALATES AND IT'S AMAZING HOW THIS HAPPENS NOW WHERE ALL HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HAVE USED TO HAVE LIKE DAILY AND IT'S UNPALATABLE I LIKE I JUST CAN'T DEAL WITH THE SWEETNESS OF IT AND AND SO I AVOID I CERTAINLY AVOID ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS BUT I ALSO AVOID JUST SWEET THINGS IN GENERAL THAT HAVE SUGAR IN THEM M JUST BECAUSE THEY NOW THET YOU KNOW IS ORIGINALLY I WAS MAKE IWAS TRYING TO BE DISCIPLINED AND TRYING TO CHANGE MY DIUPAT NOW THEY JUST DON'T TASTE GOOD ME LIKEWISE I COMPLETELY LOST MY APPETITE FOR SUGAR THE TURN OF THE LAST YEAR AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT BUT I THE WAY I AM YOU EN KNOUG I DON'T HAVE AN    MECHANISTIC EXPLANATION I JUST I SAY I LIKE SWEET PEOPLE I DON'T LIKE SWEET FOOD ANY MORE I JUST DON'T I HAVE NOT LOST MY APPETITE FOR A FATTY FOODS I LOVE CHEESE AND A CERTAIN CERTAIN MEATS FOR ME A I BLAME MY URGENTINE LINEAGE I IS A IS I GRAVITATE TOWARDS THEM BUT IN ANY CASE AM AVOIDING PROCESS FOODS PROBABLY AVOIDING SUGAR IS A MULSIPIERS THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND FOR PEOPLE LISTENING OR WATCHING WE'RE NOT SETTING UP STRICT GIDLINES IT WERE JUST A BOUNCING AROUND THE A THE CARNIVAL THAT IS THE MICROBIOMENT AND A NUTRITIAN BECAUSE I THINK THAT THESE WE HEAR THIS EVERYWHERE EAT THIS DON'T EAT THAT OR THIS IS BEST FOR MICROBIUM OR WORSE FOR MICROBIM BUT I MHEARING FIBR AGAIN AND AGAIN S WERE GIN TO COME BACK TO FIBERE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE A CLOSE THE HATCH ON THIS ISSUE OF FASTING AND CLEANSING BASED ON YOUR ANSWER EARLIER IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO WHAT CLEANS OR FAST PRIOR TO AN ATTEMPT TO REPOPULATE THE MICROBIUM IN OTHER WORDS IF I WANT TO MAKE MY MI MICROBIUM HEALTHY OR IT SOUNDS LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO TRY AND FLUSH ALL THE YTHE THE CURRENT MICROBIO TO OUT OF THERE FIRST IS THAT CORRECT YET  YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT THOSE THINGS ARE KNOWN TO BE TERRIBLE OR I WOULD JUST SAY LIKE THIS YOU KNOW THE STUDIES HAVEN'T BEEN DONE AND TO ME WIPING OUT THIS MYCROBIAL COMMUNITY A IN LESS IT'S DONE WITH LIKE SOME SORT T INLESS IS DONE IN AN INFORMED WAY AND WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE INFORMATION FOR HOW THAT WOULD BE DONE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A YOU NOT PLAIN THE LOTTERY LITTLE BIT AND SO SO I I THINK YOU KOW I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THOSE IT MAY BE THAT WHEN THE STUDY IS DONE THOSE ARE SHOWN TO BE AMAZING BUT I JUST DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE DATA TO KNOW THAT YET SO IT'S SOMEWHAT OF AN ARBITRARY THING A IF SOMEBODY YOU KNOW OUT THERE FEELS WA BETTER WHEN THEY DO THIS AND ARE NOT EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH IT THAN MAYBE IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR THEM BUT I CERTAINLY CAN'T CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S SOMETHING GREAT TO DO I I I CAN'T IMAGINE A FUTURE WHERE A AS THE MICROBIUM GETS INCORPORATED INTO THE YOU KNW EMERGING PARADIME OF PRECISION HEALTH YOU GO INTO A CLENEC SOMEBODY TYPES YOUR MICROBIOM AND SAYS OH THERE'S A THIS HUGE MASS OF MIS CONFIGURATION YOU HAVE ALL THESE A INGRAFTED BACTERIA THAT LIVE THAT A RESIDENCE IN YOUR GOT MICROBIUM THATRE SENDING OUT MOLECULES THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE DO A MASSERY PROGRAMMING OF IT THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS WE FLUSH YOUR GOTS AND WE ACTUALLY GIVE A LIGHT ANOBIOTIC TREATMENT TO TRY TO KILL EVERYTHING THAT'S THERE AND THEN WE REPOPULATE WITH THIS OTHER CONSORTION OF MICRUBES THAT WE'VE STUDIED AND KNOW OR HEALTHY KNOW OR COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR HUMAN GENO AND CAN BE REINFORCED WITH THE DIET THAT WE KNOW IS GOOD FOR YOU WILL INSTALL THOSE MICRUBES WILL HELP YOU ALONG IN THE DIET TO KNOW SO YOU KNOW HOW TO NOURISH THOSE MICROBES AND THAT WILL BE THE WAY THAT WILL RECONFIGURYOUR GOT MICROBIUM SO YOU KNOW I I CAN'T IMAGINE A FUTURE WHERE THAT SORT OF FLUSHING OR CLEANSING IS PART OF SOMETHI ING FOR REPOPULATING THE GOT BUT RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS A LITTLE HALF BAKED TO ME GREAT LOVE TO TALK ABOUT FIBR AND FERMENTED FOODS BECAUSE YOU AND CHRIS AT A RELY WHAT I THINK IS A REALLY INTERESTING EXCITING PAPER AT THE END OF LAST YEAR ABOUT COMPARING AM THE INFLAMATOME U SO INFLAMATORY MARKERS OF PEOPLE WHO AIT A CERTAIN MOUNT OF FIBR OR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OF THESE FERMENTED FOODS THIS STUDY IS AMAZING FOR SEVERAL REASONS BUT AM ALMOST AS AMAZING IS HOW DIVERSE THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS STUDY WAS IN THE MEDIA IF EVERE THERE WAS A STUDY THAT WAS AM KIND OF HI JACKED BY DIFFERENT PRIORITY SCHEMES OUT THERE AM IT'S THIS STUDY SO YOU PERFORMED THE STUDY A WITH CHRIS AND YOUR POSTOCS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS ANS STAFF WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CONCLUSIONS AND WHAT SORTS OF DIRECTIVES IF ANY EMERGE FROM THIS STUDY AND I'LL JUST A PREPHASIS AGAIN BY SAYING IF I WASN'T CLEAR SOME NEWS REPORT SAID AH THIS MEANS FIBER IS NOT IMPORTANT AND THAT OTHERS SAID THIS MEANS FERMENTED FOODS AND FIBR ARE IMPORTANT AN OTHERS SAID FERMENTED FOODS ARE THE THING AND THE ONLY THING IT IT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND AM AT ONE OF THE REASONS FOR DOING THIS PODCAST AT ALL IS SO THAT WE CAN GO STRAIGHT TO A THE PEOPLE WHO PERFORM THE WORK AND EVENTHOIG'M NOT CERTAINLY NOT EXPERT IN MICROBYUM GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH ME AND ME TO ASK THE CONS O QUESTIONS THAT HAVE IVE ZERO GENDA I DO LIKE SOUER CROUT I DO DRINK THE OCCASIONAL A I COMBUCHA AM I DO LIKE LOW SUGAR NOT SO SWEET FORMS OF FERMENTED FOODS SO I WOULD BE DELIGHTED IF FERMENT OF OODS ARE GOOD FOR ME BUT I HAVE NO STAKE IN THE FERMENTED FOOD INDUSTRY A AV YA GREAT AM YET WONDERFUL AND END AND IMPORTANT NOT THERE IS IS THE ONE YOU POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE COLLABORATION WITH CHRISTOPHER GARDENERS LAB AND A YOU KNOW BUNCH OF PEOPLE A ERIC A SONDENBURG HELP LEA THE STUDY AND THEN AND THEN TONS OF LIKE YOUR SAME POSTOCK STAFF AND A OTHER PEOPLE I AT STAMFORD AND THEN WONDERFUL PARTICIPANTS THAT AM WERE WERE PART OF THE STUDY SO A HUGE TEAM EFFORT AM LET ME TAKE BEFORE I DIVE INTO THAT STUDY LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK BECAUSE I THINK THE REASON THAT WE DID THI STUDY AND AND KIND OF A CHRISOPHER'S GROUP AND AND OUR GROUP AS AS STARTED TO A PURSUE THIS LINE OF AF LOOKING AT DIETARY INTERVENTIONS AND HOW THEY IMPACKE OR MICROBIUM HOW THEY IMPACT AM HUMAN BIOLOGY GOES BACK TO THIS AM KIND OF EEPITHANY THAT WE WE HAD WHILE STUDYING THE GOT MICROBUM BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE STARTED STUDYING AT AT STAMFORD WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT AS IS CAND O NEWLY APPRECIATED ASPECT OF OUR BIOLOGY ALMOST LIKE AM FINDING AN ORGAN THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW IS THERE AND STARTING TO THINK ABOUT LIKE ALL THE DRUG TARGETS THAT WERE THERE CAN WE GO IN WITH SMALL MOLOCULE DRUGS AND THINK OF WAYS TOMANIPULATE THIS COMMUNITY TO AMILIARATE DISEASE AND A THIS IS LARGELY THE MIND SET OF WESTERN MEDICINE AND LARGELY BORNE OUT OF THE AIR OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE A YOU WAIT FOR AN INFECTION TO START A BACTERIAL INFECTION YOU TREAT WITH ANTABIOTICS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S THE WAY MEDICINE AS PRACTICED AND THAT'S BECOME LESS SUCCESSFUL OVER TIME AS WE MOVED INTO THIS ERA OF INFLAMMATORY WESTERN DISEASES AND A YOU KNOW WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THECRPENDEMIC THA SET OF WEEPING THE WORLD A YOU KNOW LARGELY MOVED OUT OF THE ERA OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT LEAST INFECTUOUSPACTERIAL DISEASES THAT THIS PARADIME OF WAITING FOR DISEASES TO APPEER AN COME INTO THE CLINIC A IS NOT REALLY VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE CONTECTS OF INFLAMMATORY WESTERN DISEASE IS AUTOOMUNE DISEASES METABOLIC SINDROM A HARD DISEASES AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASING NOW THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND A AND SO WE STARTED TO THINK A LOT ABOUT LIKE HOW CAN WE GET OUT IN FRONT OF THIS HOW CAN WE THINK ABOUT LIKE PREVENTATIVE WAYS A DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS OF METABOLIC AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES AND THIS TREMENDOUS BEAUTIFUL BODY OF LITERATURE STARTED TO COME FORWARD IN THE FIELD ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THAT SHOWED THAT THE GOT MICROBIUM IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TOMODULATING OUR IMUNE STATUS SO IF YOU CHANGE THE MICROBIUM YOU CANFUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE HOW THE IMUNE SYSTEM OPERATES AND WE KNOW THAT THE IMUNE SYSTEM IS THE AT THE BASIS OF A LOT OF THESE DISEASES INFLAMMATORY CHRONIC DISEASES AND SO IT IT BROUGHT UP THIS POSSIBILITY THAT MAY BE THE FACT THAT WERE NOT NOURISHING THIS COMMUNITY WELL ENOUGH MAY BE THE FACT THAT IT'S A DETERIORATED OVER TIME A DUE TO ALL F THE THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH AN INDUSTRIALIZED LIFE STYLE ANABIOTICS AND SO FORTH A MAY BE WE HAVE A MICROBIUM RIGHT NOW IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD THAT IS SETTING OUR IMUNE SYSTEN ATI SETPOINT SIMMERING INFLAMMATION THAT'S DRIVING US TOWARDS EASE INFLAMMATORY DISEASES AND WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO A A USE DIET SPECIFICALLY BUT JUST KIND OF LEARNE THE RULES OF HOW TO RECONFIGURE BOTH THE COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION OF OUR GOTMICROBIUM SO THAT INFLAMMATION WAS DIFFERENT IN OURBODIES SO THAT EACH ONE OF US WAS LESS LIKELY TO GO ON IN TO DEVELOP AN INFLAMMATRY DISEASE LEADING TO BETTER YOU KNOW LONGGEVITY IN HEALTH A OVER THE COURSE OF OUR LIFE AND A SO WE WE WERE UNO STUDYING TESS IN ACTUALLY IN MALSE MODELS AND REALIZING THAT A YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEEDED TO STAR DOING HUMAN STUDIES WE NEEDED TO A START STUDYING MICROBIOM AND HUMANS AND BECAUSE WE WERE STUDYING DIET WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING WE COULD GO IN AND DO RIGHT AWAY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO APPLY FOR FTIE APPROVAL FOR A DRUG BEFORE WE COULD DO A HUMAN STUDY WE COULD JU START DOING HUMAN DIETARY INTERVENTIONS LAUNGITUDALLY MONITERING THE IMUNE SYSTEM AND THE MICROBIUM AND STARTING TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER OF WHAT IS IT IN DIET CANCHANGE OUR MICROBIUM IN A HEALTHY WAY HELPLUS TO FIND WHAT A HEALTHY MICROBAYUM IS AND MONITOR THE UMIAN SYSTEM IN GREAT DETAIL AND SO THERERE REALLY TWO CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THIS AN ADDITION TO OUR MICROBIOM EXPERATIES ONE WAS CHRISTOPHER GARDENERS GROUP A WE WANTED TO DO THESE HUMAN STUDIES BUT WERE ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED IF HUMANS WE WORK WITH MICE HUMANS OR TERRIFYING A IN MANY WAYS THAY ROUSE THEMSELVES YOU DON'T HAVE TO THATY A OTER TO PAY FOR THEIR HOUSANG THAT THAT'S TRUE NOS THET CAN A FOUR THOUSAND OF COURSE YET SADLY JUST FOR THAT PORTION OF THE POPULATION THE A SO IT'S O CHRISOPHER'S GROUP WERE THEY ARE MASTERS AF WORKING WITH HUMAN POPULATIONS AND THEN THE OTHER WONDERFUL THING THAT WE HAVE IT STAMFORD IS AS HUMAN AMUN MONITORING CENTER A RUN BY MARK DAVIS AND HOLDEN MAKER THEY STARTED THIS BEAUTIFUL CENTER FOR ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DO IMINOLOGY IN HUMANS CRITICAL ELEMENT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE MOUTH STUDIES DON'T TRANS LIKE WELL TO HUMAN SO IF YOU CAN DO THE STUDIES IN HUMANS A SIMILAR TO HOW WE WERE THINKING ABOUT THE MICROBYUM YOU LEARN SOMETHING THT YOU KNOW AS RELEVANT TO HUMANS AND SO HAVING THAT IMMUNE PROFILING CAPABILITY WHERE WE CAN MONITER YOU KNOW HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS DIFFER OF DIFFERENT PRAMETERS IN THE IMIAN SYSTEM LONGITUNALLY IN PEOPLE FROM A BLOOD DRAW AND NOT JUST KNOW IF SEE OUR PEGOES UP OR IF INTERLU CAN SIX GOES UP OR DOWN BUT TO BE ABLE TO SEET ALL THESE FACITS OF THE UMIAN SYSTEM CHANGE IN CONCERT AS WERE CHANGING THE MICROBIUM WITH DIET WAS REALLY A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS AND SO OUR FLAGSHIP STUDY SUPPORTED BY WONDERFUL DONERS A SO THIS ACTUALLY ISN'T FUNDED BY TYPICAL FOUNDATIONS AND NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AT WAS FUNDED BIET A PHILANTHROPY WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND IF WE PUT PEOPLE ON A HIGH FIBER DIET A HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT THEIR MICROBIOMENT I MIAN SYSTEM AND IF WE PUT THEM ON A HIGH PHERMENTED FOOD DIET A DIET RICH AN LIVE MICROBES IN ALL THE METABOLITES THAT A MOUR PRESENT FROM FERMENTATION IN FOODS HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE MICROBIOMENT A MIAN SYSTEM COULD YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLE TOF WHAT THOSE DIETS LOOK LIKE AND WERE YOU CHANGING THEIR BASIL DIET WERE YOU JUST ADDING THINGS ON TOP OF WHAT THEY WERE ALREADY EATING SO THE HARD TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S DI IS IT'S VERY RD TO TRUST THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO IT AND THE'RE NOT SNEAKING AND NOT TOTALLY YE AND SO SO WE A AND YOU KNOW WE STARTED THE CENTER FOR HUMAN MICROBIUM STUDIES AT STAMFORT FOR DOING A LOT OF THESE STUDIES AND A PORTION OF THE STUDIES WE DO FOCUS ON SUPPLEMENTS PROBIOTICS  MICROBES DELIVERED IN PELFORM PREBIOTICS WHICH ARE A PURIFIED FORMS OF FIBER AND IN THOSE CASES WE ACTUALLY CAN HAVE PLACIBO GROUPS A BECAUSE YOU KNOW ITS IT'S MORE LIKE A DRUG STUDY AND A WE DON'T CHANGE PEOPLES DIETS SO WE CAN JUST ADMINISTER THIS ON TOP OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO IN A WAY THEYRE LOT MORE CONTROLLED BUT IT'S NOT FOOD WHEN YOU START DOING FOOD STUDIES YOU CAN'T DO A PLACIBO GROUP CAUSE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEIR EATING AND THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT A IT'S REALLY HARD TO JUST CHANGE ONE THING BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU START ADDING SOMETHING PEOPLE USUALLY ELIMINATE SOMETHING ELSE SO THE IDEAL WAS T A BASICALLY GIVE THESE PEOPLE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR IN THE CASE OF THE HIGH FIBER DIET JUST INCREASING PLANTBASED FIBR SO CAN YOU EAT MORE WHOLE GRAINS MORE LIUMES MORE VEGETABLES NUTS GET THE FIBR UP IN THE RANGE OF YOU KNOW FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY GRAMS PER DAY UP TE OVER FORTY GRAMS PERDAY SO CAN YOU KIND O DOUBLE OR MOR THE AMOUNT OF FIBR THAT YOU EAT PER DAY KNOWING THAT THAT WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON A LOT OF OTHER FACETS OF THEIR AM DIET THEY A EAT LESS A A MEAT ANIMAL BASE PROTINE A LESS ANIMAL BASE FATS AS A PRODUCT OF THIS A YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THAT AT GETTING BACK TO THE YOU KNO CHRISTIPHERS RULE FOR A HEALTHY DIET A A LOT OF THE MAKERON NEUTRIAN CHANGES THAT WE SAW IN THEIR DIET WERE CONSISTENT WITH A HEALTHY CHANGES IN DI LESS SATURATED FAT LESS ANIMAL BASE PROTING MORE PLANTBASE PROTINE SO A LOT OF CHANGES THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL KIND OF CAME IN CONCERT WITH JUST TELLING PEOPLE EAT A HI FIBR DI HIGH PLANTBASE A FIBRA DIET A THE PEOPLE THAT WERE EATING THE HIGH FERMENTED FOOD A DIET A THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO BASICALLY EAT A YOU KNOW FOODS THAT YOU COULD BUY AT A GROCERY STORE THAT WERE NATURALLY FERMENTED AND CONTAIN LIFE MICROBES AND SO THIS YOU KNOW LARGELY CONSISTED OF YOGER A KEEFER A SOUR CROD KIMCHI A YOU KNOW SOME FERMENTED VEGETABLES A KIND OF BRIND FERMENTED VEGETABLES PICKLES THINGS LIKE THAT BUT BUT THEY DO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS A PITFALLEN IN CHOOSING FERMENTED FOODS IS YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO DOWN THE CANNED FOODILE AND THEREIS A HUGE SET SECTION OF PICKLES AND JARS THAT ARE CANNED A THOSE ARE NOT FERMENTED FOODS THOSE ARE ARE CUCUMBERS THAT THEY'VE PUT IN A SETIC ACIT AND VINEGAR TO RECONSTITUTE THAT FERMENTED FLAVOR BUT THERE'S NO LIVE MICROBES INVOLVED IN THAT AND EVEN SOUR CROWDS IN THE CANNED FOODILE EVEN IF THEY WERE NATURALLY FERMENTED QUITE OFTEN THEIRE NOT QUITE OFTEN THEIR JUST BRIND A IN IN VINEGAR BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE NATURALLY FERMENTED ALL THE MICROBES ARE KILLED PRIOR TO CANNING OR DURING THE PROCESS OF CANNING AND SO IF YOU WANT I SO WHAT WE USE FOR THE STUDY AND IF YOU ONE HAVE LIVE FERMENTED FOODS THAT CONTAIN LIFE MICROBES YOU NEED TO BUY THOSE OUT OF THE A THE A REFRIGERATED SECTION ESSENTIALLY AND I'M REALLY GLAD YOU POINTED THIS OUT A BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND SOUR CROWD ON THE NON FERMENTED ANON REFRIGERATED SHELL  THAT IS INDEED NONFERMENTED A A LOT OF FERMENTED FOODS THAT ARE VAILABLE N YU ASK A CAN BE HIGH AND SUGAR AM SO WHER IS THERE ANY INSTRUCTION AS TO YOU KNOW GETTING PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE CONSUMING YOGRS THAT WEREN'TLOADED WITH SUGAR IF OR OR DID YOU LET THEM JUST SELECT FOR THAT THE STUFF IN THE COLD THE OVLD SECTION THAT IS FERMENTED KNOW ITS SUPERIMPORTANT POINT WE WE INSTRUCTED PEOPLE TO EAT NON SWEET D YOEOGERT'S AM THE YOU KNOW IT'S I THINK A HUGE PITFAL IN THE SARIES YOU CAN HAVE A YOGAR LOADED WITH BACTERIA A KIND OF THE BASE OF WHAT'S HEALTHY AND THEN A TUN OF LIKE ARTIFICIAL FLAVOURING AND SUGAR LOADED ON TOP OF THAT MANUFACTURES PUT A TON OF SUGAR IN AFTER THE FACTS A KIND OF MASK THE SOUR TASTE OF FERMENTED FOODS WHICH IS HARD FOR SOME PEOPLE TO BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO WHEN WE WERE SWITCHING TO MORE FERMENTED FOODS OUR DAUGHTERS WERE YOUNG AT THAT POINT WE WOULD TAKE YOU KNOW PLAIN YOGER WHICH AM THEY DIDN'T LIKE JUST KIND OF NEAT AM WE WOULD MIX IN LIKE A LITTLE MAPLE SIR UP OR HONEY AM JUST A LITTLE BIT AND GRADUALLY WE REDUCE THAT OVER TIME TO THE POINT WHERE AM THEIR PALID AJUSTED NOW THEY JUST REALLY LIKE PLAIN AM YOGER BUT IT IS YOU KNOW I THINK GETTING USE TO THAT SOUR FLAVOR IS IS DIFFICULT BUT PEOPLE REALLY SHOULD TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THOSE UM FERMENTED FOODS THAT ARE LOADED WITH SUGAR AND THAT'S WHAT WE INSTRUCTED PEOPLE IN THE STUDY AND BEER WAS NOT INCLUDED I HEAR T THE ONREF YOUL THAT ASKE WHEN I I DID A BRIEF A THING ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT THE STUDYAN  HOPELY I GOT IT RIGHT  THINK I DID UM BUT PEOPLE JOS ASK ABOUT BEER I'M NOT A DRINKER SO UM FOR ME BEER HAS NO APPEAL ANYWAY UM BUT A BEER IS FERMENTED  CORRECT UM BUT WERE THEY INSTRUCTED TO A VOID BEER OR TO DRINK BEER JUST TO GO WITH THEIR NORMAL DIETARY HABITS BUT THAT DID NOT COUNT AS A AFERMENTED FOOD AND CUMBOOCCHO WAS AS WOIT WAS AND CAMBUCCHICAN HAVE SMALL AMOUNTS OF ALCAL AND IT AM BUT A YOU KNOW A WE A CAMBUCCHO ACTUALLY WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT PEOPLE DRANK DURING THE ER CONSUMED DURING THE FERMENTED FOOD FASE AN AM THE YOU KNOW THAT THE DEAL WITH AM WITH A BEER IS THAT THERE MAY BE BENEFICIAL PROPERTIES OF THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES AND NATURALLY FERMENTED BEER BUT MOST THE BEER THAT WE BUY AGAIN AS CANNED AND FILTERED AND THERE'S NO LIFE MY CRUBS THERE SO VERY DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU YOU KNOW SIPHEN IT OFF OF YOUR HOMBREW AND DRINK IT PROBABLY IF YOU BUYIT IN STORE AS IS I GET TO THE RESULTS TH STUDYING JUST ONE MOMENT BUT I WONT SAY LOT OF PEOPLE SHYWAY FROM THE HIGH QUALITY FORMENTED FOODS BECAUSES T THEY CAN BE QUITE COSTLY UM OUT JUST PREFER PEOPLE TO A RESOURCE IN TIM PARRISES BOOK THE FOUR HOUR SHEFF HE ACTUL GIVES A EXCELLENT RECIPE FOR MAKING YOUR OWN SOUR CROUT WHICH BASICALLY UM INVOLVES CABAGE AND WATER AND SALT BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT PROPERLY BECAUSE YOU CAN GROW SOME UM NOT NECESSARILY A LEETHAL BUT SOME SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS FACTORY IF YOU DON'T SCRAPE OFF THE TOP LAYER PROPERLY BUT HE GIVES BEAUTIFUL INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOU TO DO THIS IN VATS WE STARTED DOING THIS AT HOME NOW FACTUALLY AS WE GET THE WHICH IS SERRAMMIC THAT AND YOU CANC SEYOU CAN MAKE LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRULY FERMENTED SOUR CROUT JUST FROM CABBAGE WATER AND SALT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO FOLLOW THE PROTO CAL AND IF YOURINTEREST IN SCIENCE THAT PROTOCAL LOOKS A LOT LIKE WHAT YOU'LL DO FOR MOST OF YOUR GRADUATE CAREER EXCEPT MAY BE SOME SEQUENCE IN TRO SO ANYWAY JUS TO ER FOR PEOPLE TO A SOURCE THITS VERY LOTW COST YOW COMPARED TO BUYING THE HIGH QUALITY FOR MENTED FOTS EVEN CAM BOOCHAS SOE YET YOU KNOTS LIKE FIVE DOLLARS A BOTTLE ATLY ONLY AT I'S MUCH AND IF YOU CONSUME LIQUIDS TOAY I CONSUME THEM THAT'S KIND OF IT THAT'S A JUST A THE THE START SO YEAM AND BUT YU KNOW CIF YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON A SCOPI COMBUCCHAS ANOTHER ONE THAT SUPER SIMPLE AT THE LAND GROW YOUR OWN YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST MAKE YOUR OWN IN ITS SUPER EASY TO DO I MAKE IT I LL CONSTANTLY HAVE A BACHI CAMBUCHA GOING AT HOME AND IT'S JUST DE KNOTESAS IT'S A SCOBES A SYMBATIC COMMUNITY OF BACK TEREAN EAST THAT YOU YOU KNW YOU YOU BRUT YOU HAD SUGAR TO IT AND YOU PUT THE SCOPIAN AND YOU WAIT A WEEK OR TO DEPENDING UPON THE TEMPERATURE AND YOU THEN YOU JUST YOU KNOW MOVE THE SCOBY OVER TO A NEW BATCHIN YAT YEAR OLD YE WHAT THE SCOPY WAS IN IS CAMBUCCHA AT'S IT'S WONDERFUL I LOVE I WOULD LOVE IT IF NUMBERS IS AUDIENTS WOULD A STARE TO MAKE THEIR OWN COMBUCCHA AND SARCA I AVE BEEN HAVING SO MUCH ONE I DON'T DO IT BUT IM YOU KNOW A IT'S DONE IN OUR HOME AM I DON'T I DON'T GON'T NO ANYWHERE NEAR THE FOOD A PRODUCTION  S FOR EVERY ONE'S BENEFIT AM SO HOW MUCH FORMENTED FOOD AND THEN A WERE THEY CONSUMING AND CAUSE YOU MENTION THE NUMBER OF GRAHAMS APPROXIMATELY OF FIBR AND A WAT WAS IT EATEN SERVINGS OUNCES A HOW MANY TIMES A DAY EARLY DAY LATE DAY RIT YES SO A THE WE HAD A WONDERFUL DIETICION INSTRUCTING PEOPLE FOR THIS AND O NAMESTOLLYOR PROMEN AND SHE REALLY WAS THE KEY AND IS THE KEY FOR MANY OF OUR STUDIES FOR GETTING PEOPLE TO EAT DIFFERENTLY AND AM YOU KNOW I THE GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS WERE FOR PEOPLE TO EAT AS MUCH FORMENTED FOODS AS POSSIBLE MORE AS BETTER AND BUT TH THE REASON IS THAT WITH THIS INITIAL STUDY WE REALLY WANTED TO MAXIMISE OUR CHANCE OF SEEING A SIGNAL IF THERE WAS SOMETHING BIOLOGICAL GOING ON WITH THE IDEA THAT IF WE YOU KNOW THE DOSE WAS EXCESSIVE AND NOT YEASILY ACHIEVABLE BY A LOT OF PEOPLE THE END WE CAN GO BACK AN INSA O CE THIS THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH WE LOSE THE BIOLOGICAL SIGNAL  BUT PEOPLE AM DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE INTERVENTION FASE THE INTERVENTION FASE WITH SIX WEEKS AM DURING THE HEIGHT OF THAT WERE UP OVER SIX SERVINGS ON AVERAGE PER DAY OF FORMENTED FOOD SO KIND OF TOO SERVINGS AT EACH MEAL AND THAT  YOU KNOW OUNCES OR WEIGHT OR SIZE DIIT REALLY DEPENDED ON WHAT THE FORMENTED FOOD WAS AND WE JUST TOLD THEM TO STICK TO WHAT WAS A RECOMMENDED DOSE ON THE THE PACKAGE THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE BUYING YOU KNOW FOR COMBUCCHA BE LIKE A SIX TO EAT OUTS GLASS AM SOUR CRAWT LIKE A HALF CUP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN SAM WITH ORE GREAT SO WHAT WHAT WERE THE RESULTS YES SO THAT THE RESULTS AM ASTOUNDED US IN A WAY BUT THEN THINKING MORE DEEPLY AN AN E   IT'LL BE EVIDENT EVEN AFTER I EXPLAIN IT IN THE CONTECTS OF THIS CONVERSATION LIKELY WHY WE SAW THE RESULTS WE SAW AM THE RESULTS WERE ASTOUNDING BECAUSE AM OR HYPOTHESIS GOING INTO THIS WAS THAT THE HIGH FIBRE DIET WAS GOING TO GIVE THE MASS OF SIGNAL WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE BIG DEFICIENCY IN THE WESTERN DIET AM WE A ALL THE MOUSE STUDIES HAVE TOLD US THAT HIGH FIBRE REALLY LEADS TO A MUCH HEALTHIER MICROBIOTO CAN LEAD TO POSITIVE CHANGES IN THE IMUNE SYSTEM AND IN FACT EVEN WHEN WE HAD A LIMITED YOU KNOW WE HAD WONDERFUL DON OR SUPPORT BUT STILL LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY WHEN WE STARTED THE STUDY A MY LAT WAS REALLY VERY EAGER TO DO THE HY PIBERER A PART OF THIS REALLY WELL AND CHRISTOPHER KIND OF HAD TO TWIST OUR ARMS TO DO THE FERMENTED FOOD SITE OF IT AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF WORKIN AN NEE LIFE LIFE MICROBES SHOULD BE EXCITING LIKE LET'S TRY IT SO WE PUT THAT IN AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WE WERE VERY THANKFUL THAT HE TWISTED OUR ARMS BECAUSE IT WAS THAT A HYGH FERMENTED FOOD ARM THAT REALLY GAVE US THE BIG SIGNAL EVEN THOUGH OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS AT THE HYGH FIBR WAS IN A LEAD TO MORE SHORCHINE VADIACIDS PRODUCED IN THE GOT A MORE DIVERSE MYCROBIOTA A LESS INFLAMMATION IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WE DIDN'T SEE THAT ACROSS THE COHORT WE ACTUALLY SAW VERY INDIVIDUALIZED RESPONSES TO THE DIATARY FIBERE AND ALL COME BACK TO WHAT THOSE RESPONSES WERE THE THE BIG SIGNAL REALLY WAS IN THE FERMENTED FOOD GROUP WE SAW ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD HOPE TO SEE IN A WESTERN MICROBIOTA AND WESTERN HUMAN WE SAW THIS INCREASE IN MICROBIOTO DIVERSITY OVER THE COURSE OF THE SIX WEEKS WHILE THEY WERE CONSUMING THE FERMENTED FOODS A AND WE CAN'T ALWAYS SAY THAT A HIGHER DIVERSITY IS BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO OUR MICROBUAL COMMUNITIES WE KNOW THEIR CASES FOR INSTANCE BACTERIAL VAGANOSIS WERE HIGHER DIVERSITY AS ACTUALLY INDICATIVE OF A DISEASED STATE A BUT WE A KNOW IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GOT AND FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD HIGHER DIVERSITY IS GENERALLY BETTER A WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A SPECTRUM OF DIVERSITY PEOPLE WITH HIGHER DIVERSITY GENERALLY OR  HEALTHIER IF YOU CAN PUSH YOUR DIVERSITY HIGHER YOUR IN BETTER SHAPE AND SO WE SAW THAT INCREASE IN DIVERSITY AND THEN THE MAJOR QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE IMUNE SYSTEM AS THESE PEOPLE WERE INCREASING THEIR GOT MICROBIOTO DIVERSITY THROUGH THE FERMENTED FOODS A WE SO WE DID THE A THIS MASSIVE IMMUNE PROFILING AND WE SEE YOU KNOW A COUPLE DOZEN IMMUNE MARKERS IN FLAMMATORY MARKERS DECREASE OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY SO WE MULTIWE A MEASURE THESE AT MULTIPLE TIME POINTS THRUGHOUT THE COURSE OF TE STUDY IN THEIRS KIND OF THE SEP STEP WISE REDUCTION IN THINGS LIKE INTERLUCAN SEX AND A YOU KNOW A INTERLUCAN TWELVE VARIETY OF KIND OF FAMOUS IN FLAMMATORY MEDIATORS  AND THEN EVEN IF YOU GO INTO THE IMMUNE CELLS AN YOU START LOOKING AT THEIR SIGNALLING CASCADES WE SEE THAT THOSE SIGNALLING CASCADES OR LESS ACTIVATED AT THE END OF THE STUDY COMPARED TO THE BEGINNING OF THE STUDY INDICATING IN ATTENUATION OF INFLAMMATION SO SO KIND OF EXACTLY WHAT WE WOULD HYPOTHESIZE WOULD LEAD TO LESS PROPENSITY FOR INFLAMMATORY DISEASE OVERTIME THAT'S A A HUGE EXTENTION OF A VERY SHORT STUDY IND OLONG WAS A STUDY SO THAT THE COMPLETE PROTOCOL I THINK WAS FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN WEEKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE ACTUAL INTERVENTION PHASE CONSISTED OF A FOUR WEEK RAMP AND THEN A SIX WEEK MAIDENANCE PERIOD SO THE INTERVENTION ITSELF WAS TEN WEEKS BUT THERE WERE SIX WEEKS OF REALLY KIND OF HARD CORE HIGH LEVELS OF OF FIBRE OR FERMENTO  YET AT NI 'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THE RAMP CAUSE MY EXPERIENCE WITH A FERMENTED FOODS IS THAT YOU IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO GIVE THE SYSTEM AND OPPORTUNIE TO ACCLAMATE I MIF YOU CONSUME A GIANT BOWL OF SOUR CROWD A IT'S I CON BE THE WORST DAY AND NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE BUT YOU YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW YOU DID IL JUS LEAVE IT AT THAT AND SO YOU WANT A KIND OF ACCLAMATE TO IT A I MEAT THE POINT NOW WHERE PULET SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THISS GROS BUT I AFTER I  EXERCISE AV BIN SWEATING A LOT I LIKE THE SALTINESS OF THE AC SHUL DRINK THE A THE LIQUID THAT THE THAT THE SOUR CROWD HAS BEEN A STEING IN AND I GET I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT I CONSUME SOME A FERMENTATION THAT WAY IT SALTY ACESS KIND OF A A POST TRAINING A REPLENISHMENT BUT IF I HAD DONE THAT A SIX MONTHS AGO STRAIGHT OFF I THINK I IT WOULD HAVEBEEN PRETTY ROUGH OR MY SISTEM MY STARTED TAKING LITTLE BITS OF IT IN THEN ADDING AT EACH TO TOTALLY AND SO BOTH WITH THE FERMENTED FOODS IN THE FIBRE IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT THAT THIS KIND OF GRADUAL RAMPING IS A REALLY IMPORTANT WAY OF MITIGATING A BLOATING ANOTHER CAN AVE DIGUST OF DISCOMFORT THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE MY CROBIUM RECONFIGURES AND STARTS FERMENTING MORE AND CHANGING COMMUNUITY MEMBER SO A YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT RAMP AT YOUR OWN PACE IF SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE GOING WRONG JUST CAN A LEVEL OF STAY THERE YOU KNOW WED WE DID THIS IN A VERY DELICATE WAY TO GET PEOPLE UP TO THE HIHDOS THE A BRAIN QUESTJUST A A A TANGIN HERE FOR A SECOND A THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE A HAD PEOPLE USED IN THE FERMENTED FOOD FASE THERE'S ACTUALLY PRODUCT CALLED GUT SHOTS WHICH IS JUST THE BRINE FROM THAT THEY'VE MARKETED A WE ACTUALLY NAWADGE STUDYING IT IN THE LAB I JUST ACTUALLY BEFORE THIS CAME FROM A LAB MEETING WHERE A G I FELLOW IN MY LAB IS ACTUALLY PUTTING GOT SHOTS STERILIZED GOT MY CROOR THE FRMENFERMENTED A A FERMENTATION MYCROBES REMOVED OR PRESENT INTO MICE AND LOOKING AT CHANGES IN THEIR MECOSAL A MAN SYSTEM SO ERE STUDYING THIS IN DETAIL NOW BECAUSE THIS IS IT'S A RICH SOURCE OF LACK TATE AND A BUNCH OF OTHER INTERESTING MATAPOLITES I LOVE THAT MY WEIRD BEHAVIOR IS A IT VERTANTLY BEING STUDIED A AT STAMFORD MEDICINE A I WANTED JUST MENTIOUS THING ABOUT THAT THE GOT SHOTS A THOSE ARE R SOL IT AS A AS A DRINK THOSE ALSO JUST FOR CERTAIN LISTENERS IN DIFFERENT BUDGETS THAT CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE IF YOU REALLY THINK AOUT SOME OF THEM ARE EXCEEDINGLY EXPENSIVE BUT THEWHAT I DESCRIBED BEFORE WITH MAKING YOUR OWN A CAMBUCHA'S T IS NOT QUITE BRINING BUT THE A HO MADE SOUR CROWT THAT PROTOCAL IS OUT THERE IS A MENTION IN IN TIM SPOKE THE THE FOR HOUR SHAFF AND YOU GET A LOT OF THE BRINING FROM FROM THAT AN ALMOST ENDLESS AMOUNT A A CAUTIONARY NOTE I ONCE  WENT INTOTHE REFRASRATON AND SAW SOMETHING SIMILAR TO GOT SHOT IT WASN'T GUTCHO AND I DRANK THE WHOLE TWELVE OUNCE BOTTLE AND REALIZED THAT IT WAS TWENTY FOUR SERVINGS AND THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY INITIAL A EXPERIENCE WITH WHAT IT IS DID NOT DO A RAMP UP PHASE YE DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THAT SOME OF THESE IT'S VERY POTENT IT SEEMS AND YOU CAN CONSUME YOU KNOW EVEN A HALF AN OUNCE UR ANNOUNCE YAVE TER I MEAN VERY POTENT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF FERMENTATION BUT ALSO VERY SALTY SO I KNOW THER THERE'S THE LOT OF AFFECTS YE AN Y DON'T DO WHAT I Y A AT LEAST NOT AT THE OUTSET AND A A BUT SO THAT IS A AN EXPEDERIENCE TO WARNING SO THEY DID THIS AS I RECALL THERE WAS A SWAP CONDITION WHERE THERE WAS A HALT CONDITION SO YOU DID CONTROLS RIGHT WE WASN'T JUST COMPARING GROUPS YOU HAD INDIVIDUALS A WHO WERE INITIALLY IN ONE GROUP OR THE OTHER A MOVE TO ADUPT DIFFERENT GROUP WEL SO WE  FOR LITTLE STOP AND THEN RETURN YET WE WE ACTUALLY JUST DID A STOP AND FOLLOWED THEM DURING A WASH OUT FASE AND I THE IDEAL SITUATION FOR A DIETARY INTERVENTIONS LIKE THIS ARE TO DO A CROSS OVER STUDIES AS YOUR SUGGESTING WE'VE A RECENTLY COMPLETED A KEE TO GENIC FOR SIS MEDITERRANIAN DIET INTERVENTION OR E DATE A PUBLISHED A NOT YET THE CHRICIPHERS BEEN TWEATING A LOT OF THESE DATA AND THERE'S A HAPER IN REVISION RIGHT NOW SO IF YOU GO TO CHRISTOPHER GARDENERS A TO ID PUT ER FEED YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND HIM REPORTING SOME OF THE THE EARLY RESULTS OF  STUDY GIVE US A SNIP IT OF WAS THERE SUR PURE JUST GIVE US A YOU OUGHT TO TELL US WHICH ONE BUT A WAS ER SUPERIOR A CONDITION OF EITHER MEDITERRANEAN VERSES KEE TO GENIC SO A SO I SHOULD THE MENABOLIC AFFECTS OF THESE A IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STUDY I SHOULD LET HIS GROUP COMMENT ON THAT THE MICROBIOTO TY A WE ACTUALLY OR JUST GENERATING NOW SO THAT THE STUDY THAT HES HIS GROUP HAS PUT TOGETHER FROM THIS IS A LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE MICHROBITE DATA AND NOW WERE DOING A MWERE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS AND I'LL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT THE FUTURE BUT NOW RETURN TO THAT  BUT IT'S A SUPER EXCITING STUDY BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THESE WERE PEOPLE EAT A CERTAIN WAY AND WHAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THIS AS WEVEN GOT FOOD DELIVERED FOR PART OF THE A INTERVENTION SO WE HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OVER WHAT THEY AT LEAST HAD AVAILABLE TO EAT A AND THEN THE SECOND FASE THEY A THEY A MAKE THE FOOD ON THEIR OWN AND THEN WE CROSS OVER AND DO THE SAME THING AND SO THAT'S REALLY LIKE THE A IF YOU HAVE  A GOOD ENOUGH BUDGE ET THE RIGHT WAY TO DO A STUDY LIKE THIS FOR THIS WE DIDN'T HAVE THE A THE TIME OR MONEY TO DO ACROSS OVER BUT WE DID DO A WASH OUT FASE WERE PEOPLE WE DIDN'T MAKE THEM STOP EATING WHATEVER IF THEYE WERE ENJOYING IT BUT WE MONITORD AND THERE WAS SOME RCITIVISM WHERE THERE WAS A DECREASE OF FIBR FORMENTED FOOD AND WE COULD SEE FOR INSTANCE DIVERSITY START TO PLATEAU AND REVERSE AND MANY THESE PEOPLE SO THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE LIKE A A NEED FOR MAITENANCE AF THE INTERVENTION TE MAINTAIN THE PERCEIVED HOWTH BENEFITS THAT WE WERE MEASURING GREAT  WE WILL PROVIDE A LING TO THE STUDY IN THE CAPTION AND THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY CLEAR AND THROUGH DESCRIPTION A FROM THE VES ONE OF THE INVESTIGATORS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY THAT I IT'S GREAT TO GO DIRECT TO THE SOURCE A ANECDOTALY WERE THERE IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD IN A RESISTANCE TO COLTAN INFECTION A DURING THE COURSE OF THE STUDY AND THIS IS A KIND OF A PRELUDE TO WHERE IM HEADED NAXT WHICH IS THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INTEREST IN THE SO CALLED GUTBRAIN ACCESS BUT ALSO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THT WE TALK ABOUT HOW THESE MI GROBES IN THE CONDITIONS THEIR ESTABLISHING IN THE GOT OR CREATING POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE HEALTH OFFACTS HAVING ACTION BASELY HOW SIGNALS GET OUT OF THE GOT T A SO DID PEOP I CERTAINLY NOTICE THAT WHEN I MEANING MORE FORMENTED FOODS OR THEIRS PROBIODICTS IN  IN DRINKS I CONSUME AND SO FORTH THAT I FEEL QOULDN'T QUOTE AIR QUOTES COMPLETELY SUBJECT I FEEL BETTER  AM I WISH THERE WAS AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF FEELING BETTER A BUT I SEEM TO THINK MORE CLEARLY SLEEP BETTER MOOD ET CETERA AND I KNOW I'M NOT ALONE IN THAT A AND PEOP  AND ANYTIME IAVE TAKEN HARSH AND TO MY ODECTS I FEEL WORSE BUT THEN AGAIN I'M USUALLY TAKING THEM BECAUSE I'M FEELING BAD ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE OR I I DON'T TAKE THEM JUST BECAUSE SO DID PEOPLE SAY THEY WERE FEELING BETTE A IN ANY WAY AND IF SO WHAT DID YOU OBSERVE AND AGAIN WERE HIGH LETTING THESE IS ANIC DATA YATOTALLY A YOU KNOW WE A AS AS PART OF THIS EFFORT A TO LOOK AT HOW DIETARY INTERINTERVENTIONS EFFECT AR OUR HEALTH AND WELL BEING IN SO FORTH IN MY CROBIUM IN A MAN SYSTEM A WE A INTERACT WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIKE RED AR BOOK OR YOU KNOW KIND OF HAVE BECOME MY CROBYUM ENTHUSIASTS AND OF IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF THESE CHANGES IN THIR PERSONAL LIFE AND I HEAR THE SAME THING THAT THAT YOUR SAYING INTOU THAT YU KNO TONS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE MORE ENERGY THEY THINK MORE CLEARLY THE SLEEP BETTER THER FAMILY IS NICOR TO EACH OTHER LIKE THE NUMBER OF CRAZY THINGS AND IT'S REALLY HARD TON COUPLE LIKE IS IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN CHARGE NOW OF WHAT THEIR EATING AND JUST FEEL BETTER IN GENERAL FOR BEING IN CONTROL OF KIND OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR IS THERE THIS CASCATING A SET OF EFFECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW IMPACTING AR ARE YIFYOU KNOW CONEMANATING FROM THE CUPBRAIN ACCES AND AND SO WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED A BUNCH OF QUESTIONAIRS AND EVEN A COGNITIVE TEST TO TRY TO A GET AT SOME OF THIS AND AND I SHOULD SAY YOU KNOW THAT THE LIST OF THIS GOES ON AND ON THEIR PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THAT THEIR COMPLECION IMPROVES AND THAT THER YOU KNOW ALARGIES AND THERE'S PROBABLY ALL SORTS OF REPLE EFFECTS IF YOU CAN AFFECT YOUR INFLAMMATION YOU WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN AFFECT YOUR COGNITION WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN FFECT YOURE YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR SKIN AND INFLAMMATION THAT'S OCCURRING ON YOUR SKIN SO SO I REALLY THINK THAT THERE IS A BASIS FOR A LOT OF THOSE ANECDOTES IT MAY JUST BE HARD TO SEE IN A SHORT STUDY AND IN A A SMALL OU KNOW A SMALL CORD OF PEOPLE OVER SHORT PRID OF TIME BUT WE DIDN'TREALLY SEE SIGNIFICANT THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITION AND MOODS AND YOU KNOW ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THAT A WE WERE TESTING FOR WHICH A YET THERE THERE COULD BE A VARIETY OF EXPLANATIONS OR THAT TE YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE A A A STANDARDIZED A A STOOL MEASURE THAT PEOPLE USE AND THERE WAS A YOU KNOW KIND OF LESS CONSTIPATION BETTER BATLE MOVEMENTS OVER THE COURSE OF BOTH OF THESE INTERVENTIONS SO IT DID SEEM LIKE BAL HABITS IMPROVED WHICH A A LOT OF TIMES CAN LEAD TO BETTER MOODS BUT THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO TOMESUE THE CLASSIC PCYCLANILESS WOULD HAVE A A FIELD TEY WITH THAT UM WHAT SORTS OF INTERESTING THINGS DID YOU OBSERVE IN THE FIBR GROUP BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THAT THAT GROUP U YIELDED SOME UNEXPECTED FINDINGS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS THAT YOU THINGS YOU EXPECTED TO SEE YOU'DIDN SEE AS TO THE SAME AMPLITUDE AS YOU DID IN THE FERMENTED FOO GROUP BUT I'M GUESSING YOU ALSO SAWU SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS IN THE FIBR GROUP TO TOTALA YASO A SO WE STARTED LOOKING AT THE DATE AND MORE DETAIL WHEN WE DIDN'T SEE THE COHORT WIDE  RESPONSE AND A ONE OF THE THINGS WE OBSERVED IS THAT IN MEASURING ALL THESE IMMUNE PARAMETERS THERE APPEARED TO BE THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF KIND OF IMMUNE RESPONSES THAT WE WERE SEEING ONE GROUP THAT GOT OVER ALL LESS IN FLAMMATORY AND THEN TWO OTHER GROUPS THAT KIND OF HAD A MIXED RESULT PARTLY MORE INFLAMMATORY PARTLY LESSAN FLAMMATORY IN ALL THESE MARKERS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT AND WHEN WE STARTED DIGGING INTO LIKE WHAT A ASPECT OF THE YOU KNOW BIOLOGY OF THOSE PEOPLE DICTATED OR PREDICTED WHICH GROUP THEY FELL INTO THE REALLY INTERESTING PART IS THE PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY GOT MYCROBIUMS TO START THE STUDY WERE THE ONES THAT WERE MOST LIKELY TO HAV THE A DECREASES AND INFLAMMATION AND SO E THE YOU A DATA SEEM TO BE TELLING US THAT IF YOU START OFF WITH A DIVERSE MYCROBIOTA MAY BE ONE THAT'S BETTER ECUIPPED TO DEGRADE A WIDE VARIETY A DIETARY FIBRE YOURE MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO IT IF YOU HAVE A VERY EPLEATED GOT MYCROBYUM YOURE NOT IS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO IT IND THINKING BACK TO THAT EXPERIMENT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WITH THE MULTI GENERATIONAL LOSS OF OF FIBRE FORMENTING MY CROBES IN IN MCE THAT WERE FTAT A A WESTERN DIET A IT IT MAY BE THAT A MANY OF US IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD HAVE A MYCROBIUM THAT SO DEPLEATED NOW THAT EVEN IF WE CONSUME A HIGH FIBRA DIET AT LEAST FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT MY CRUBES AN R GOT TO DEGRADE THAT FIBRE AND THIS AS ACTUALLY BEEN OBSERVED BY OTHER GROUPS BEAUTIFUL STUDY OUT OF UNIVERSITY OF MINISOTA LOOKING AT EMIGRANTS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES AND YOU KNOW WITHIN NINE MONTHS BUT CERTAINLY OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS IMMIGRANTS THAT COME HERE LOS AF A A LOT OF THE DIVERSITY UNDER GOT MYCROBYUM BUT A LOT OF THE FIBR DEGRADING CAPACITY IN THERE GOT MY CROBIUM TO SO IT COULD BE THAT OVERTIME THIS BECOMES HE ONE WAY STREE AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO RECOVER A THE THE MICROBES THAT THAT ACTUALLY NDEGRADE THE FIBRE AND I THINK THAT THIS PROBABLY INTERSECTS WITH SANITATION IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO NEW MYCROBES THAT MIGHT HELP US DEGRADE THE FIBRE THAT WE ACTUALLY A YOU KNOW HAVE LOSS THESE MYCROBES IN THEIR IN SOME WAYS OURECOVERABLE WITHOUT DELIBERATE REINTRODUCTION OF FIBR DEGRADING MY GROUPS I CAN RECALL FROM CHILDHOOD THE WRE GIDS THAT WOULD EAT DIRT YIN SNAILS AND ITHARS IS SOUNDS TOLLY DISCUSTING BUT YOU KNOW GIDS COVERED WITH MAUD AND UM YOU KNOWED THAT MAY BE NOT SO MUCH ANY MORE AND IT CERTAINLY DURING THE PANDAMIC THERE 'S BEEN A LOT MORE UM USE OF THESE HANDS ANTIZERS THAT PRIOR TO THAT PEOPLE SEEM PRETTY SPOOKED ABOUT BUT THAN OBVIOUSLY THE THEY PRIORTIZED THEM UAM SO DDO YOU WHILE YOU HAVE CHILDREN DID YOU O YOU ENCOURAGE THEM TO A TO WHEN THEY WERE THE YOUNG DID YOU ENCOURAGE THEM TO INTERACT WITH PETS AND DIRT AND ABSON A STOFFEN THE ENVIRONMENT PROVIDED THAT STUFF WASN' IMMEDIATELY TALKS OF YO EXACTLY SO THIS IS REALLY YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A CONTINUAL A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS I THINK THE A I I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW I WITH THE PANDEMIC NOW AND A CERTAINLY JUST WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN GENERAL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF A YOU KNOW THE THE POSSIBILITY FOR COMPROMISING YOUR HEALTH THROUGH THE SPREAD OF GERMS AND SO THAT THAT IS JUST EE NO HANDWASHING IS IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH YOU KNOW AM THE THE SPREAD OF GERMS BUT I DO THINK THAT A YOU KNOW THE SANITATIOUS SANITIZATION OF OUR ENVIRONMENT A HAS GONE OVERBOARD WITH THE YOU KNOW A VARIOUST THINGS BEING IMPREGNATED WITH ANOBIOTICS YOU O SHOPPING CARTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND TOOTH BRUSHES AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S LIKE ANAOBIOTICS AND AND A YOU KNOW THINGS FOR KILLING MY CROBES OR HER EVERYWHERE AND WHEN WE WERE RAISING WE KNOW WHEN OUR DAUGHTERS WERE YOUNG AND WE'RE WEERE MAKING THESE DECISIONS THE CALCULATIONS THAT WE WOULD MAKE WERE REALLY AM ONE A HOW LIKELY ERE THEY TO ENCOUNTER A DISEASE CAUSING MY CRUB IF WE'VE BEEN OUT YOU KNOW ON A HIGH OR IN OUR GARDEN YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF WORKING IN THE DIRTER WHATEVER MAYBE IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT TO WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE YOU HAVE LUNCH EVEN IF THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DIRT ON THEM A IF THEY'VE BEEN IN A PUBLIC PLAYGROUND WERE MAYBE THERS A OTHER KIDS WITH GERMS OR MAYBE EVEN CEMICALS LIKE PASTICIDES AND AND ER BESIDES THAT ARE BEING USE A MAYBE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN TO WASH YOUR HANDS YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THE GROCERY STORE ON THE SUBWAY PROBABLY GOOD I DEAD TO WASH YOUR HANDS BUT ITSO I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT KIND OF THE THE CONTECT OF IT AND A I EXPOSURE TO MY CROBES A FROM THE ENVIRONMENT IS LIKELY AND IMPORTANT PART O A EDUCATING OUR MEAN SYSTEM AND KEEPING THE PROPER BALANCE IN OUR MEAN SYSTEM AN ITS JUST A MATTER OF FIGURING OUT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THAT SAFELY AND IT MAY BE THAT THE FERMENTED FOOD RESULT THAT WE SAW IS A WAY OF CAPPING INTO THE SAME PATHWAYS KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE TOF MY CRUBS THAT' SAFE INTERESTING LIKE TO TOUCH ON HOW SIGNALS GET FROM THE GOT TO THE REST OF THE BODY AND A WE PRI DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT BENEFIT FROM HAVING A DIVERSE MICROBYUM OR HEALTHY MICROBYUM BUT YA WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMEN SYSTEM AM THERE'S ACTIVE SIGNALING IN TRANSPORT FROM THE GOT ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH AS FAR AS I KNOW INTO THE BLOOD STREAM INTO OTHER ORGANS AND TISSUES SO FOR THE MEAN SYSTEM AM IT SEEMS STRAIGHTFORWARD AM TO REDUCE IN THE AMOUNT OR NUMBER OF INFLAMMATORY SIDE A INES LIKE ILE SIX AND SO FORTH MAY BE INCREASED THE ANTIIMPLAMATORY SIDE OF KINDS LIKE ILETON  AND OTHERS BUT WE KNOW THERE'S A GOT BRAIN ACESS AN DURONS THAT LITERALLY TALK IN BOTH DIRECTIONS BETWEEN BRAIN AND GOT BUT LET SAY I I EATING MY FORMENTED FOODS A'M DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS AND I MY GOT IS DIVERSE AN I'VE ALL THE GOOD GOOD EAS AT ALL THE RIGHT PLACES HOW IS IT THAT A THAT THE FACT THAT THOSE MICROBOUT AR THRIVING IS CONVEYED TO THE REST OF THE BODY A BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THEIRE DOING THEIR THING AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A MIND BUT THEIR PROBABLY NOT THINKING OF TAKING CARE OF ME ANDREW BUT I GET FEEL BETTER OR I MIGHT A GET SICK LESS OFTEN OR COMBAT A ANY ALMESS MORE QUICKLY HOW IS THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENING AMAN IS IT IS IT THAT THE MICROBIOUT O STAY RESTRICTED TO  THE GOT BUT THE SIGNALING MOLECULES ARE ALL DOWNSTREAM A IN A DOWNSTREAM WAY OR ARE MAKING GOOD OR BAD THINGS HAPPEN WORE IS THERE SOME SORT OF DIRECT RECOGNITION AT THE BODY LEVEL OR THEIR SELLS IN THE BODY THAT AR RESPONDING TO O THEY GOT MICROBONAMAS HEALTHY AND THEREFORE I CAN MAKE MORE OF THE GOOD STOFF IN LESS OF THE BAD STO YET  SPEAK YET THE GREAT THE I A YOURE RITE IT SUPERCOMPLEX THERES A HUGE ARRAY OF WAYS THAT OUR BODY A PERCEIVES A BOTH THE MICRUBES AND THE MOLECULES THAT THEY PRODUCE IN OR GOT AND THE MOLECULES THEY PRODUCE ARE OF COURSE OF PRODUCT OF WHAT MICRUBS ARE THERE AND THEN WHAT THEY RECEIVE AS CKIND OF METABOLIC IN PUTS WHAT WERE EATING AND WHAT OTHER MICRUBES ARE OR PRESENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT PROVIDING MOLECULES TO THEM SO HEU KNOWTIES IS COMPLEX MATRIXS BUT WE YOU KNOW THAT A PROBABLY THE THE SIMPLEST PLACE TO START IS JUST THE IMUNE SYSTEM WE HAVE A IN IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT THEY KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF MUNE CELLS IN OUR BODY OR LOCATED IN OUR GOT JUST BECAUSE THEYRE SUCH A A DENTE A POPULATION OF MICRBS THERE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW THER THE'RE A WE CONSIDER THEM A BENEFICIAL MICRUBES BUT THEY'RE ONLY BENEFICIAL IF THERE IN THE RIGHT SPOT IN THE GOT AS SOON AS THEY MIS LOCALIZES WE KNOW THAT THEY BECAN BECOME OPPORTUNISTIC PATHAGENS AND SO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM REALLY PLAYING IN IMPORTANT ROLE TO KEEP TO THEM IN PLACE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THIS SYSTEM NOT A MOVING INTO A DISEASED SPACE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS A VARIETY OF WAYS OF OF MONITORING WHAT MICRUS ARE THERE THEYRE ACTUALLY SPECIALIZED STRUCTURES IN THE GOT A KNOWN AS PIRA PIRES PATCHES THAT ACTUALLY TAKE UP MICRUBS THEY THEY ACTUALLY ALLOW MICRUBES TO TRANSIT IN TO THIS POPULATION OF IMMUNE CELLS IN A VERY CONTROLLED WAY SO THAT TAST SET OF AMUNE CELLS BECOMES EDUCATED AS TO WHAT MICRBES ARE JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRIER WHILE IT'SOM A COUND OF LIKE A BORDER PATROL EXACTLY YESOR THEY THEY BRING THEM IN THEY THEY YOU KNOW FINGER PRINT THEM AND THEN A YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE KIND OF THIS A YOU KNOW SET OF RESPONSES READY TO GO IF NEEDED ME A THEYRE THEY'RE OTHER CELLS KNOWN AS IN DRIDIC CELLS SPECIAL TYPES THAT ACTUALLY SEND A LONG ARMS THESE PROCESSES OUT INTO THE LUMINOF THE GOT AND DO THE SAME THING TAKE UP MICROBES BRING THEM BACK IN AND SAMPLE THEM A IN ADDITION TO THESE DIRECT SAMPLING MECHANISMS THE CELLS THAT LINE THE GOT HAVE E A HUGE ARRAY OF RECEPTORS SPECIALIZED PROTINES THAT PERCEIVE PATTERNS THAT THE A MOLECULAR PATTERNS THAT THE A MICROBES MAKES SO THINGS LIKE INDOTOX AND MIPAPOLI SACRIDE A JUST THE CELL WALL OF THE A MACTERIA WE HAVE SPECIALIZED RECEPTORS THAT RECOGNIZE THOSE IF THOSE SIGNALS BECOME TWO PROFOUND OR IF THEYRE PERCEIVED IN THE WRONG PLACE THAT CAN STIMULATE AND INFLAMATORSSO THERE'S ALL THESE WAYS OF KIND OF MONITERING THE MEMBERSHIP AND WHERE IT IS AND HOW CLOSE IT IS BUT THEN THERE'S IS WHOLE OTHER SET OF A WAYS OF PERCEIVING METABOLIC ACTIVITY IN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE N YOU MENTION BEFORE THIS DIRECT A ENO THESE CELL TYPES THAT A EXPRESS TASTE RECEPTORS IN THE GOT AND HAVE WAYS OF SAMPLING DIETARY COMPONENTS THERE 'RE THOSE SAME TYPES OF A ARE AN ANALOGOUS CELLS IN ARE GOT THAT ARE PERCEIVING METABOLITES PRODUCED BY THE MICROBIOTO SO THAT A OUR BODIES CAN PERCEIVE WHAT SORT OF METABOLIC ACTIVITY IS GOING ON AND THEN YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE 'S THIS TREMENDOUS ITREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT INTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT A SENDING SIGNALS BACK TO THE PRAYING DICTATING THINGS LIKE  MOTILITY DO I GET RID OF WHAT'S IN HERE DO I MOVE IT ALONG QUICKLY WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY IS IS HAPPENING DO I NEED TO INTERACT WITH T MUNE CELLS SO THERE'S TIS REALLY COMPLEX ARRAY OF OF A INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND THEN A LOT OF THE CELLS THAT ARE IN THE GOT PERCEIVING ALL OF THESE SIGNALS A LOT OF THE IMUNE CELLS CAN ACTUALLY GET UP AND LEAVE THEY CAN YOU KNOW GET INTO THE BLOOD CYCLED THROUGH AND AND THEN HOME TO OTHER REGIONS AF THE A MUCHOSAL SURFACES SO THAT MUCHOSAL SURFACES ARE ARE A EDUCATED BROADLY AGAINST WHAT'S A WHAT'S PASSING THROUGH OUR GOT SO THERE'S THERE'S A A VRIETY OF WAYS OF CELLS COMMUNICATING AND THEN A LOT OF THE MOLECULES THAT THE MICROBIOTA MAKES CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE BLOOD STREAM DIRECTLY AND AN SO YOU KNOW THE A THE ARRAY OF MOLECULES IS STILL BEING DEFINED WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WHAT ALL THESE CHEMICLES ARE WE MENTION THE SHORT CHAINE VADIACIDS BUT THOSE ARE JUST THE TIPITHE ICEBERG THER REALLY INTERESTING COMPOUNDS LIKE A YU KNOW INDOL DERIVITIVES AND A FENALS AND AND IU KNOW DERIVED FROM MENOACIDS METABOLIZE BY GOT MICROBES TAKEN UP INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND THEN WE FURTHER METABOLIZE THESE THEY BECOME KIND OF CO MICROBE HOST METABOLITES AND THEN THEY CAN GO ON AND BIND TO DIFFERENT RECEPTORS THROUGHOUT OUR BODY ANYWHERE OR BLOOD STREAM HAS ACCESS TO AND START TO TRIGER SIGNALING CASCADES IS IT KNOWN WHETHER NOT ANY OF THOSE M OLECULES ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER BECAUSE THE HYPOTHESIS IT A AND THE CURRENT THINKING IS THAT A NOR TRANSMITTERS MANUFACTURED IN THE GOT AND SIGNALING ALONG THE GOT BRAIN ACIS LITERALLY NURONS TALKING BACK AND FORTH ELECTURICALLY FROM BRAIN TO GOTIN GOT TO BRAIN IS WHAT REGULATES THINGS LIKE MOOD OR AT LEAST AN ANIMAL MODELS AND THERE SOME EMERGING HUMAN STUDIES IMPROVEMENT OF SYMPTEMS IN IN A OTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS IT MAYBEVEN IN EIGHTY EIGHT TO WHAT A BASELY SAYING HERE IS THAT THEREIS SOME EVIDENCE A EMERGING THAT IMPROVING THE GOT MICROBIUM CAN IMPROVE A OUTCOMES IN PSYCHIACTURIC AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS BUT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THAT THE THAT THE MICROBIOTA THEMSELVES ARE MANUFACTURING CHEMICALS THAT CAN MAKE INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND THEREFORE I'M ASKING IF THOSE CHEMICALS CAN MOVE FROM THE BLOODSTREAM INTO THE BRAIN DIRECTLY IT MAY NOT BE A GOT BRAIN AXIS VIA NURONS IT ACTURIC A A SPECEEPAGE OF CERETONAN INTO THE BRAIN AND WER TOLETO CALLING INTO THE BRAIN FOR FOR THAT MATTER TOTALYA AND YOU KNOTHE A THE TAS THTHE BIOLOGY F MOST OF THESE MOLECULES IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD BUT CERTAINLY IN LIKE CERER SFINAL FLUID THAT'S BEEN ANALIZED A IT'S YOU CAN PERCEIVE THESE MYCROBULE METABOLITES SO THEY ARE THERE THE ANSWERED WE YES SOME F SOME OF THEM ARE GETTING ACROSS THE MBUT SO REALLY INTERESTING THING IS I THINK A LOT OF THESE MOLECULES ARE  IF THERE EXPERIENCE THAT HIGH ENOUGH DOSES ARE A TOXIC OR HALF TOXIC PROPERTIES WE KNOW THAT A A LOT OF THESE A METABOLITES WHEN THEY MAKE THE RAIN OF THE BLOOD STREAM EVENTUALLY ARE EXCRETED THROUGH THE KIDNEYS AND URAND SO ACTUALLY WE CAN MONITER THE METABOLISM THAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR GOT BY ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE METABOLITES THAT ARE PRESENT IN YOUR URINE BECAUSE THOSE MANY OF THOSE ORIGINATED IN YOUR GOT FROM YOUR GOT MYCRUBS BUT PEOPLE WITH KIDNEY DISEASE WHOSE KIDNEYSE A FILTERING PROCESES NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY ACTUALLY A BUILD UP HIGH LEVELS OF MANY THESE METABOLITES IN TO THE BLOOD STREAM AND A THAT CAN LEAD TO MORE OF THESE MOLECULES MAKING IT ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AND IN FACT SOME OF THE A TRANSPORTERS IN THE KIDNEY THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SHUTTLING THESE MOLECULES OUT INTO URANE ARE ALSO FOUND AT THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER FOR SHUTTLING THE MOLECULES BACK INTO THE BLOOD STREAME IF THEY DO GET ACROSS AND AND WE KNOW THAT LIKE MENTAL FOG IS A BIG ONE OF THE BIG SYMPTOMS OF KIDNEY DISEASE PETENTUALLY BECAUSE THE LOT OF THESE METABOLITES ACCUMULATE IN BLOOD AND THEN MAKE THEIR WAY ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER INTO O THE SENTRAL ER SYSTEM AMAZING I'M GLAD YOU MENTION MENTAL FOG A FEW YEARS BACK THERE WERE SOME A REPORTS A SOME SCIENTIFIC REPORTS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE IN IN THE MEDIA THAT A EXCESSIVE IN TAKE A PROBE O PILLFORM PROBIOTICS COULD CREATE MENTAL FOG I DO'T NOW IF THAT EVER TOOK HOLD A AND AN IT RAISES A GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT A PILLFORM PROBIOTICS AI TOOK THEM FOR A FEW YEARS JUST THINKING THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR MY GOT MICROBOMAN THAN I SWITCH TO THE FERMENTED FOOD THING THE LARGELY ON THIS A CONSEQUENCE OF AT THE WORK THAT YOU AND CRISPUBLISHED AM BUT IT WHAT WHAT'S THE THOUGHT ABOUT PROBAX FOR FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON THAT'S NOT RECOVERING FROM A ROUND OF ANTABIADICS WERE THAT AM HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED THEM AM I'VE HEARD THAT THE SPECIES OF A MICROBIODA THAT THEY A PROLIFERATE MIGHT NOT BE THAT SPECIES THAT WE WANT TO PROLIFERATE BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT MAYBE THAT DOESN'T MATTER SO WHAT WHAT'S YOUR GENERAL STANDS THEY CAN BE QUITE EXPENSIVE EM ALSO I KNOW I'V N IKG ABOUT EXPENSE LOT TODY BUT IALWAYS WANT TO TAKEIN TO ACCOUNT THAT PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP TO THE TABLE AT WITH AVRIETY OF BUDGETS AND YOU PROBAC O ONE OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE SUPPLEMENTS OU THAT YOU CAN QUICKLY GET INTO THE SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ER MONTH IF YOUR GETTING THE A QUOTUN QUOTE BEST QUALITY ONES AND IF THEY'RE GOT ACTUALLY CAUSING BRAINFOG THAN A MATTERID WANT TO USE THEM NOW COMPLETELY AND THERE'S A TUNNIS SNAKE OIL OUT THERE I MEAN THERE'S JUST PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY I KNOW I THINK THAT MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE AWARE THAT THEY CAN PRAY OFF OF PEOPLE'S FERES AND GET A LOT OF MONEY FROM THEM WITH ABSOLUTELY NO DATED TO BACK UP THEIR PROBATIC IS DOING ANYTHING AM THAT SO I THINK THAT THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS BY OR BEWARE BECAUSE IT'S A SUPPLEMENT MARKET ITS LARGELY UNREGULATED AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF BAD PRODUCTS OUT THERE AND  A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT AM YEVEN THOUG THEY'RE NOT INTENDED TO BE BAD JUST DON'T HAVE GREAT QUALITY CONTROL THER AVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE TAKEN OFF THAT A OVER THE COUNTER JUST KIND OF OFF THE SHELF PROBADUCTS SURVEYED WHAT'S IN THEIRE BASED ON SEQUENCING AND SHOWN THAT THEY WHAT IS IN THERE DOES NOT MATCH WHAT'S ON TE LAPLE SO THAT THAT'S TRUE OF MANY SUPPLEMENTS AND UNFORTUNNG SUPPLEMENT COMPANIES THIS IS TONLY WE GET INTO ON THE BOD GASTLLOT THERE THERE ARE REPUTABLE BRANDS AND THEY GO THROUGH A LOT OF WORK TO TO GET THINGS RIGHT AND THERE ARE MANY THAT JUST FOR WHATEVER REASON IT JUST DOESN'T MATCHWIS LIST EXACTLY AND SO THERE THERE ARE AM I PLACES THET PROBATIC COMPANIES CAN SEND THEI'R PRODUCT TO HAVE IT INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATED SO YOU AN TO LOOK FOR THAT SORT OF VALIDATION ON THE UNA PRODUCT M THERE ALSO ARE NAMES THAT ARE JUST VERY WELL KNOWN AND AM YOU KNOW IT'S A MYOU KNOW THEIRE REPUTATIONS ARE ON THE LINE SO THEY PROBABLY IN VEST SO LITTLE BUT MORE IN QUALITY CONTROL THAN MAY BE SOME OF THE OTHER LESS ER KNOWN NAMES AM BUT YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A HUGE RANGE OF AM DETA AN PROBIADUCTS AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE THING THAT WE KIND OF RECOMMEND IS YOU KNOW AM TRY TO FIND GOOD PRODUCTS AND EN EXPERIMENT FOR YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR YOU I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW CONSTIPATION AN AM YOU KNOW CAN'T DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THEIR DIET AND HAVE FOUND TO PROBATIC THAT HELP SOME WITH THT AM IF YOU CAN FIND THAT RIGHT NEX GREAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WONDERFUL AM I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE DAT A RIGHT NOW IS NOT AM OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE FOR WHAT T PROBIOTICS DO TO THE GOT MY CROBIOTUS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NICE STUDIES LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF PROBATICTS ON RE COVERY AFTER ANABOTIC TREATMENT AND IT APPEARS TO SLOW DOWN THE RECOVERY OF THE MECOSAL MYCROBIOTA A AND A SOME SOME OTHER STUDIES THAT HAVE A WERWERE THE THE BIG SIGNAL ISN'T SEEN AS YOU MIGHT HOPE WITH E A PROBATIC THAT SUPPOSED TO TREAT A DIFFERENT DISEASE THERE HAVE BEEN META ANALYSIS THAT DO SUGGEST IN CERTAIN INSTANCES RECOVERY FROM A A  ANABIOTICS THAT THERE EVEN THOUGH IT MAY CAUSE YOUR MY CROBITER TO RECOVER MORE SLOWLY THAT IT MAY ACTUALLY PREVENT A DIREAL DISEASE RECOVERY FROM VIRAL DIRY IS PROBATIS MAY HELP BUT BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A HUGE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND BECAUSE EACH PERSON IS THEIRE OWN LITTLE KEEPER WHEN IT COMES TO THE MYCROBIOM IT'S REALLY HARD TO KNOW A WHETHER THERE ARE GREAT PRODUCTS FOR A GIVEN INDICATION THE REALLY GOOD ADVICE THAT I HAVE HEARD IS TRIDE OF FIND A A A STUDY THAT SUPPORTS IN YOU KNOW A REALLY WELL DOES IN STUDY AN THIS IS VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE N'N SCIENTISTS TO AVALUATE BUT SO YOU KNOW WITH YOUR EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL PROBLEM OR WHEN IT CONSULT TE DOCTOR A THE EU KNOW THAT THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL BUT FINDING A STUDY WHERE SPECIFIC PROBATIC HAS SUCCESSFULLY DONE WHATEVER IT IS YOUR LOOKING FOR AND THEN STICKING WITH THAT PROBIOTIC IS REALLY THE BEST RECIPE FOR AS A AS A PLACE TO START IN THE SPACE ITHING AND WHAT ABOUT PREBIOTICS IS THEIR NUMBER OF A REASONS WHY I CAN IMAGINE THE PREBACS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL A WHICH ESSENTIALLY ITS YOUR PUSHING THE FIBR SYSTEM WHICH WE TALKED ALOUT ABOUT TO DAY YET YE ABSOLUTELY A YOU KNOW THAT THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON PREBIOTICS THE IT'S REALLY KIND OF A MIXED BAG OF RESULTS THE A THERE'VE BEEN STUDIES DONE WITH A PURIFIED FIBRES WHERE YOU ACTUALLY SEE MY CROBIOTED DIVERSITY PLUMMET OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY BECAUSE A YOU GET A VERY SPECIFIC BLOOM IN A SMALL NUMBER OF BACTERIA THAT ARE GOOD AT USING NAT ONE TYPE OF FIBR AND THAT'S AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL THE OTHER MY CROBES THAT ARE IN THE GOT AND SO A SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO REPLICATE WITH PURIFIED FIBRE WHAT YOU GET FOR INSTANCE TAT A SALAD BAR IN TERMS OF THE ARRAY OF COMPLEX CARBA HYDRATES THAT YOUULD BE EXPOSING YOUR MYCROBOTO TO AND I THINK THE KIND OF A A BROAD VIEW OF THIS IN THE FIELD IS THAT CONSUMING A BROAD VARIETY OF PLANTS IS AND AND ALL THE THE DIVERSE FIBRE THAT COMES WITH THAT IS PROBABLY BETTER IN FOSTERING DIVERSITY IN YOUR MYCROBIOTA THEN PURIFIED FIBRES NOW THERE ARE A AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM PURIFIED FIBRES EITHER FOR GEIMOTILITY A OR OR FOR OTHER ASPECTS OF AF GI HEALTH PROMS THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING AGAIN I THINK IT'S A TYPE OF THING WHERE YOU HAF TE  TRY TO FIND THE THING THAT THAT'S RIPE FOR YOU BUT THERE A THERE ALSO OUR STUDIES THAT SUGGEST THAT IF YOU LAYR RAPIDLY FOR MENABLE A FIBRES ON TOP OF A WESTERN DIET YOU ACTUALLY CAN A RESULTING IN WEIRD METABOLISM HAPPENING IN YOUR LIVER BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS INCREDIBLY RAPID FERMENTATION OF FIBR ALONG WITH A LOT OF FAT AM COMING INTO THE SYSTEM AT LEAST THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THEORY AND IN A MOUSE STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED A FEW YEARS AGO THEY ACTUALLY SEE THAT A SUBSET OF THE MICE DEVELOP HAPATISALULAR CARSONOMA WHEN THERE FETA A HI DOSE PREBIOUT O ANSWER LIVER CANCER ON TOP OF A A ON TOP OF A WESTERN DIET SO WHETHER THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF HUMAN BIOLOGY WE DON'T KNOW BUT A YOU KNOW PURIFIED FIBRES ARE DEFINATLY VERY DIFFERENT A'M BOTH IN TERMS OF THE DIVERSITY OF STRUCTURES BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF HOW RAPIDLY THERE FORMENTED IN THE GOT BECAUSE A YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE EATING PLANTS THE COMPLEX STRUCTURES THERE REALLY SLOW THE MICROBES DOWN AN TERMS A FERMENTATION IN YOU AND UP WITH A SLOW RAID OF FERMENTATION OVER THE LENGTH OF YOUR COLLIN AS OPPOSED TO THIS BIG BURST OF FRMENTATION THAT CAN HAPPEN IF YOU EAT SOMETHING THAT IS HIGHLY SOLUBLE AND AND EASILY ACCESSED BY THE MICRUBS INTERESTING SO I GUESS I IS A FAIR TO COME BACK TO THIS IDEA AM TRYING AVOID PROCESS FOODS THE HIGHLY PALITABLE FOODS THERE ALGHT SOMETIMES SUPERHIGHLY PALITABLE FOODS THERE NOW CALL THETERE PACKED WITH HIDDEN SUGARS AN ALSO FIRE SO AM SOUNDS LIKE SOME FIBR IS GOOD AM AND DESPITE THE OUTCOME OF THE STUDY YOU IDENTIFY THAT IF YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE MICOBIOTAR THAN YOU WILL A BACK ROUND THAN NET ONE WILL RESPOND EVEN BETTER TO THE FIR MAYBE A LONGER RAMUT FACE FOR FOR THOSE FOLKS AND THAN THE FERMENTED FOODS IT'S NO REASON WHY YOU CAN'T DO BOTH AND AS WE TALK ABOUT BEFORE I'M A LOT OF FORMENTED FOODS HAVE FIBR SO YOU CAN AGUILTY BIRDS WITH ONESTONE TOTALLYN AND IT COULD BE THE THE DIVERSITY INCREASE THAT WE SAW IN THE HIGH FERMENTED FOOD GROUP COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD AID THE HIGH FIBRE GROUP AND SO NOW WERE PLANTING ANOTHER STUDY COMING UP WERE WE'RE DOING HGH FIBRE HIGH FERMENTED FOOD AND THEN FIBRE PLUS FERMENTED FOOD JUST TO SEE IF THERE'S A CENTER JUSTIC AFFECT THE HATE ON IN ROLL AM SERIOUSLY ALTHOUGH I GUESS ONBIASD CAUSE I SORVOE NO WHERE YOU'R TRYING TO WHIT A WELL IT'LL IS IT BLOOD DRAWS THAT YOU USE TO MEASURE THE INFLAMOTONE ITEXACTLY SO WE ON A O S L LARGER I WEANS I SOUT THE ARA SO YOU'VE COVERED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL THIS WAS A AREABIOLOGY THAT DESPITE HAVING LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THROUGH PAPERS AND GOING TO TALKS AND AND READING ARTICLES IN THE MEDIA HAS REMAIND SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS TO ME UNTIL TO DAY YOU'VE GIVEN US A VERY VIVID PICTURE OF HOW THI SYSTEM WORKS WHERE CAN PEOPLE FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING A WE CONCERTALIN PROVIDE LINKS AND AN YOU AND AND YOUR WIFE A CO RUN YOUR LAB YOU HAVE A BOOK ON THIS TOPIC SO COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE BOOK WHERE WE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SANAN BURG LAB IN THE WORK OF YOURE DOING A MAYBE PEOPLE EVEN TRYING IN ROLLAN SOME OF THESE STUDIES YE FANTASSICA'D BE GREAT IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO IT AND ROLL WERE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A FOR R WE NUN WILLING PARTICIPANTS A YES O A ERICAND MY WIFE AND I WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE GOOD GOT AND A THAT THAT REALLY WAS A A RESPONSE TO HOW WE WERE CHANGING OUR LIVES IN RESPONSE TO TO BEING IN THE FEELD BEING VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE RESEARCH SEEING THAT A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS THAT WEREN'T STUDYING THET GOT MICROBYUM BUT WERE VERY WELL INFORMED MANY OF THEM SCIENTISTS WE'RE NOT DOING THE SAME THINGS WE WERE DOING AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT IT WAS JUST THA A LACK OF INFORMATION FUNNLING OUT OF THE FIELD TO OTHER PEOPLE AND SO WE WANTED TO A MAKE THAT ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT MICROBYUM SCIENTISTS THERE'S ALSO A REALLY INTERESTING STORY WE ARE AT A A CONFERENT SIGHT THAT JUST HAW SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES ALL SUMMER LONG WEEK AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK DIFFERENT FIELDS AND SO IT'S PEOPLE THE WORK THERE THAT ARE JUST DEALING WITH THESE NEW GROUPS COMING IN WEEK AFTER WEEK AND THE WEEK WE WERE THERE FOR MICROBYUM CONFERENCE A PEOPLE A A THE WORK IN THE DINING COMMENTS CAME UP TO US IN THEY SAID WHAT GROUP IS THIS THIS IS WEIRD AND WERE LIKE WHAT'S WERE IN THE SAID WE CAN'T KEEP THE SALADBAR STOCK AND IT WAS JUST IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT NOBODY WAS DOING WHAT WE WERE DOING UNTIL WE'D GO TO MICROBYUM CONFERENCE AND THEN EVERYBODY WAS DOING THE SAME STUFF THAT WE WERE DOING AND SO AM SO WE ANYWAY WE WROTE THIS BOOK TO TALK ABOUT OUR PERSONAL JOURNEY AND KIND OF THE SCIENCE IN THE FIELD AND A YET JUST TO A LAY A FOUNDATION FOR PEOPLE IF THEY WANT O START THINKING ABOUT THESE CHANGES AND THEN YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF A AND OF CONNECTING WITH OUR RESEARC CERTAINLY THERE'S THE CENTERE FOR HUMEAN MICROBYOM STUDIES AT

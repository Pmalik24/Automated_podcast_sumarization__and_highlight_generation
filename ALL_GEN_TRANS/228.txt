THE OCIA WHEN YOU GET OFF COURSE THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF DANGERS AT DFACE IT JUST ARE NOT THERE WHEN YOU'RE A DRY LAND FE BE JUDGE AS A STORY WHEN YOU SEE SOME OF THAT SHE'S TOST OF THIS IS LOVE POTCAST WER REVERSION OF THE STORY FIRST ROWN WHEN LINCOK WAS A TEA NATURE SHE WAS A COMPETITIVE LONG DISTANCE OCEAN SWIMMER SIX DAYS A WEEK SHE'D WAKE UP EARLY TO SWIM IT A BEACH NEARHER HOUSE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SIBICALLY SHE'D BEEN BACK AND FORTH IN THE DEEP WATER BETWEN A REALLY LONG PIER AND A STONE JETTY SHE WAS TRAINING FOR A TWENTY ONE MILE SWIM IT WAS MARCH AND I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND I WAS CIMING FOR A MORNING SWIN IT WAS BEFORE THE SUN HAD RISEN AND THE WATER WAS PITCHBLACK I STARTED SWIMMING BETWEEN THE SIBYSH PIER AND THE JETTY A SOF MY PLAN WAS JUST TO GO IN AND AND STRETCH OUT AND SWIM FOR AN HOUR AND BE DONE AND THEN GO HANG OUT WITH MY HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS BUT AND I STARTED SWIMMING AND AS I GOT CLOSE TO THE PIER I FELT THE WATER HOLLING OUT AROUND ME MEANING I COULD FEEL SOMETHING UNDERNEATH PULLING MEFORD  FELT LIKE SOME HING REALLY BIG WAS SWIMMING BELOW AND SO IN MY MIND UP THINKING ALL MY GOSH IS IT A SEAL LIK KNOW IT'S TO BIG FOR SEALA SICHO KAS IT A DOLPHIN NO IT'S NOT A DOLPHIN AND THEN I THAT ONL MY GOT COULD IT BE A SHARP WHAT IS THIS BELOW ME IN THIS IS MOST PEOPLE'S BIGGEST NIGHTMARE ON EARTH THAT THEY WOULD BE SWIMMING IN THE LATER AND THAT THEY WOULD FEEL SOMETHING LARGE UNDERNEATH THEM I THINK THAT'S NORMAL TO BE SCARED A ME WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING BELOW BUT YOU CAN FEEL SOMETHING IAND YOU CAN ALSO NOT JUST FEEL THE MOTION BUT THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO THESE LONG SWIMS YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR MIND UNDER CONSROL BECAUSE YOU  FREEK OUT THAN YOU'RE OUT OF A SWIM SO I KEPT TALKING TO MYSELF AND SANG O KA YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT IT IS JUST MOVE CLOSER TO SHORE SO I I SWAM CLOSER A SURE BUT THIS THING KEPT SWIMMING ROUND NEAR ME THE WATER KEPT GETTING HOLLOWED OUT AND I REALIZE THAT WHATEVER WAS THERE WAS STILL THERE AND IT HAD NOT GONE AWAY AND I WAS JUST READY TO TURN AND RACE OUT OF THE WATER BUT THERE WAS AN OLD MAN NAME STEEVE WHO WORKED IN THE BAT SHOP ON THE PERE AND HE SORT OF WATCHED OVER ME AND WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE WATER AND I COULD SEE HIM SSTANDING UNDER A LIGHT ON THE PEER WAVING TOWARD ME TO COME TO SWIM OUT TO HIM AND HE YELLED AT ME AND SAID LEN COME HERE YOU KNOW THERE'S A BABY WHALE SWIMMING WITH YOU YO SEE YOU STICK YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE WATERAND HE'S WAVING AND HE AND HE SAYS THERE'S A BABY WHALE YES HE SAID A BABY WALE AND I LIKE REALLY I'VE NEVER SEEN A BABY WALE IN THE WHILE BEFORE SO HE TOLD ME THAT YOU KNOW THE BABY WHALE HAD LOST HO MOTHER AND  NEEDED TO STAY WITH THE BABY WHALE WHY DID YOU NEED TO STAY WITH A BABY WHALE WHY COULDN'T YOU GET OUT HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF I TURNED TO GO TO SURE THAT THE BABY WHALE OF FALL ME AND POSSIBLY COULD RUN AGROUND BUT HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT KNOW MABE THE BABY WHALE WILL JUST SWIM OFF AND BE TOTALLY LOST SO HIS I DEA WAS THAT YOU KNOW YOU JUST NEED TO STAY WITH THA BAB WHALE IT CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR BABY WHALES TO BE SUPPERATED FROM THEIR MOTHERS THERRE PREDITERS AROUND LIKE SHARKS AND ALSO YOUNG WHALES ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON THEIR MOTHER'S MILK TO SURVACHT A WHILE BACK THERE'S A STORY ABOUT A BABY WHALE GETTING SO LOST HE TRIED TO SUCKLE ON A YACHT THAT SENSE OF BEING LOST WIT SOMETHING I RELATED TO WITH HA BABY WHALE IS IT IS IT EASY AS A SWIMMER TO GET OFF COURSE YES HEND I THINK THE THING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE OCEAN IF YOU GET LOST AND YOU TRI TO CONTINUE GOING YOU START SWIMMING ANA HUGE CIRCLE AND THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE TO FIND YOU AND SO THE MOTHER MAY NOT FIND THE BABY EVER AT THIS POINT LINDSTILL COULDN'T SEE THE BABY WALE BENEATH HER IN THE WATER SHE ONLY SAW BITS IN PIECES OF IT SWIMMING YOU COULD ONLY SEE PART OF THEM ME YOU COULDN'T SEE HIS WHOLE HEAD OR FACE YE TO SAW THE THE ON HIS BACK AND THE BABY GRAY WALE THAN SURFACT AND HE SWAM OVER TOWARD ME YE WIS SCARY IT WAS CRY CAUS HE WAS SO BIG AND I WAS NOT SRE HOW TO DEAL WITH HIM I MEAN YOU KNOW HOW DO I INTHER ACT WITH A WHALE SEEVE THOUGH WAS SO CALM AND AND A SURE THAT IT WAS JUST FIND TO BE IN THE WATER WITH A BABY THAT I THOUGHT WELL HE KNOWS HE'S THIS OLD GUY THATS SPEN OUT HERE FOR EVER AND SO HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT THE OCEAN SO I WILL DO WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO AS AND I'LL JUST STAY OUT HERE WITH HIS WALE UNTIL WE FIND HIS MOTHER STEV GOT ON THE RADIO TO ALL THE FISHING BOAT CAPTAINS AND LIFE GUARDS ALONG THE COAST AND TOLD THEM TO KEEP THEIR EYES OUT FOR A LARGE GRAY WHALE TRAVELING NORTH HE TOLD LYNNE TO SWIM BACK TOWARDS THE JETTY ONCE SHE GOT TO THE JUTTY SHE TURNED AROUND AND SWAM BACK TO THE PEER AGAIN THE BABY STAYED WITHER WE WERE SORT OF SIDE BY SIDE OR HE WAS RIGHT UNDERNEATH ME OR IM VERY VERY CLOSE AND AT ONE POINT HE JUST ROLLED OVER AND LOOKED RIGHT AT ME AND IT WAS JUST THE MOST A MASINGTHING IN THE WORLD BECAUSE I FELT LIKE HE SEES ME AND I SEE HIM AND WERE TOGETHER OL BAG IS A BABY GRAY WALES EYE IT WAS SORT OF IM THE SIYES I'D SAY O A PLUM OR A ORANGE IT' IT'S LARGE AND IT WAS DARK DARK DARK BROWN ALMOST BLACK DID YOU TRY TO TALK TO HIM WERE YOU TALKING TO HIM YES YES YES AET I AS LIKE AS IF HE WOULD UNDERSTAND BUT END I TOLD THE BABY O KAY AND THAT THINGS THINGS WILL WORK OUT AND WELL FIND HIS MOTHER AND I'M THINKING I MY GASH HE CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY WORS BUT MAYBE UNDERSTAND THE FEELING OR THY INTENTION THEY SWAM FOR AN HOUR THEN ANOTHER HOUR LYNNE STARTED TO WONDER IF IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE FOR THE MOTHER TO FIND THE BABY HOWD HE FIND SOMETHING IN THE OCEAN SHE GOT SCARED THAT THE MOTHER MIGHT NEVER BE COMING SHE GOT SCARED THAT THE MOTHER COULD BE DEAD MAYBE THE MOTHER WAS DEAD SOME PEOPLE HAD GATHERED ON THE PIER WITH STEEVE TO WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THE FISHERMEN OUT IN BOATS WERE ALL TALKING TO EACH OTHER ON THE RADIO ONE OF THEM REPORDED SEEING THE LARGE GRAY WHALE SWIMMING NEAR AN OILE RIG ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF OFF SHORE AND THEN AS THOUGH THE BABY WALE WAS LISTENING TO THE RADIO IT ABRUPTLY TURNED AND STARTED SWIMMING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OILE RIG NORMALLY LYNDE WOULDN'T SWIM OUT INTO THE OPEN OCEAN WITHOUT A BOAT OR SOMEBODY NEAR HER BUT SHE DECIDED TO FOLLOW HE MADE A POINT OF SWIMMING RAIT IN FRONT OF ME N IN A LITTLE BIT BELOW SO I COULD SWIM IN SLIP STREAM AND I THOUGHT WOW I THAT HE LEARN THAT FROM HIS MOTHER I BED WHEN THEY WERE MIGRATING NORS HE WAS IN HER SLIP STREAM AND ENABLE AN ENABLED HIM TO SWIM MUCH EASIER THAND THEN AGAINST THE STRONG CURRENTS AND IT WAS I SI COL ME BECAUS I WAS HARDLY MOVING AT ALL MY HARMS AND I WAS JUST FLYING THROUGH THE WATER AND I JUST THOUGHT WOW YOU KNOW AN I KE KNOW I AT TIMES I TRIED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DOES HE SEE ME AND HE MUST HAVE THOUHT HORRIBLE SWIMMER SHE IS YEY JUS SES JUST SO BEAUTIFUL ELEGANT GRACEFUL IN THE WATER AND JUST MOVE SO EFFITLESSLY AND I JUST ON DI KIK OF IS IF IS THEN HIS TAIL TIN IS FLUK AND HE WOULD JUST MOVE AND HERE I WAS LIKE STRUGGLING WITH MY ARMS IT WAS JUST HE PROBAAY THOUGHT I NEEDED HELP BY THIS TIME LYN HAD BEEN IN THE WATER WITH THE WHALE FOR ALMOST FOUR HOURS A STRUN A SWIMMER AS LYNDE WAS SHE DIDN'T HOW MUCH LONGER SHE COULD BE IN THAT COLD WATER THEY SWAM TOWARDS THE OILE RIG FOR A WHILE BUT DIDN'T SEE THE OTHER WHALE AND LYNDE REALIZED SHE'D HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION SOON OU KNOW I WAS USED TO SWIMMING A VERY LONG DISTANCES BUT I AT THEIR POINTS ALONG THE WAY WHERE I WAS GETTING TIRED AND COLD BECAUSE HE KNOW I WAS NOT SWIMMING AT MY NORMAL SPEED I WAS TRETTING WATER I WAS WONDERING WHERE HWALE WAS GOING CAUSE HE WAS SUDDENLY DIVING DOWN DEEP INTO THE WATER AND I THINK IT WAS ABOUT A FOR AND HALF HOURS OR FIVE HOURS INTO THIS TIME OUT THERE IN THE WATER I WAS GETTING RETHER COLD AND I REALIZED THAT I WAS PUTTING MYSELF IN DANGER NOW YOU KNOW THAT I COULD GO INTO HYPITHERMIA AND IF I GOT HYPITHERMEA THAT I COULD BECOME REALLY DISORANTED AND I COULD ALSO FAST OUT IN THE WATER YOU KNOW IT WAS FIVE HOURS A SWIMING AROUND AND NOT RALLY GOING ANYWHERE SO I'M I DECIDED THAT I REALLY NEEDED TO START GETTING BACK TOWARD THE PEER SHE TURNED AROUND AND SWAM BACK TOWARD THE PEER THE WHALE STAYED WITHER THEN LYNG SAW A LONG BEACH LIFE GARD BOAT COMING TOWARDS HER AT FULL SPEED AND WHEN IT REACHED HER THE LIFEGUARD TOLD HER SHE WAS OUT TOO FAR THEN HY TOLD HER SOMETHING ELSE A COMMERCIAL FISHING BOAT HAD SPOTTED A SOLOW WHALE ONLY A HALF MILE FROM THE PEER WE'RE LEN USUALLY SWAIM  THAT THE WHALE WAS NOW SWIMMING IN THEIR DIRECTION KEPT THINKING

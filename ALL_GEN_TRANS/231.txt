INVESTIGATION ANT OFFICER NDERSON WHICH QUITE OUT IN A STRANGE AND SURPRISING WAY THAT HAD SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE MATHISIS BEN STARTS WITH TACT ONE CHIEF LOUISIDES IT UP HERE'S BEN SO THERE WAS THE OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION INTO OFFICER ANDERSON BY THE MISKIGAN POLICE DEPARTMENTS INTERNAL AFFAIRS TEAM AS YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD LAST WEEK THAT INVESTIGATION WENT KINA SOFT ON HIM THE INVESTIGATOR LITERALLY INVITED ANDERSON TO QUOTE EXPLAIN AWAY THE SITUATION U WHILE THAT INVESTIGATION WAS UNFOLDING THE POLICE CHIEF JEFF LEWIS WAS TAKING HIS OWN LOOK AT ANDERSON A HARDER WORE CRITICAL LOOK TURN OUT LOUIS HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT ANDERSON BEFORE ANY OF THIS HAPPEN IN FACT A YEAR BEFORE THE MATHIS IS POST A VIDY  HAD POPPED UP ON LINE THE MADE LOUIS WORRIED ABOUT ANDERSN WE WATCHED US TOGETHER IT WAS A SELFORIN VIDIO TAKEN AT NIGHT WITH THE WOMEN BEING PUSHED INTO THE BACK OF A MISKIGAN POLICE HARG ANDERSON IS STANDING BEHIND THE OFFICER DOING THE PUSHIN AND THEN YOU SEE TWO WOMEN WALK OUT ONE YOUNGER AND THEN ELDERLY WOMAN WRIT NEXT TO HERR BOTH BLACK LIKE EVERY ONE IN THE VIDO BUT ANDERSN SO ANDERSON TURNS AND HE SEES THE WOMEN I'M SURE HE HAS HI SID E STORY WHIC YOU SEE HE SPENDS ROUND AN JUST WITHOUT EVEN TRYING TO VERBLY DE AS LATOR DOINGTING HE DIS SHOVES THIS ELDERLY WOMAN TO THE GROUND WHICH IS JUST INTERPROPRIATE IT IS WON IS JUST LIKE OT ABOUT S  WHY DI ME A MA MI A  PLA  OMA A ME  MI O A I  JUST CAN'T JUSTIFY THAT I JUST CAN'T ANY WAY I LOOK AT IT I CAN'T EVEN SAY HE WAS TECTICALLY RIGHT CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER EVER THROWING DOWN A GRANDMOTHER AND MY CAREER AI JUSTDON'T FEEL LIKE THROWN A GRAMADOWN A COMPLAINT WAS FILED ABOUT THIS INCIDEN AND LOUIS TOOK NOTE HE IS CONCERNED THAT ANDERSEN WAS KIND OF A COWBOY AND AGGRESSIVE THEN THE VERY SAME WEEK THEMATHISIS POSTED HE HEARD ANOTHER STORY ABOUT ANDERSON A BLACK BUSINESS OWNER HE KNEW TOLD HIM ABOUT A DISTURBING RUN AN SHE'D HAD WITH HIM THAT HE'D BEEN BRUDED AND AGGRASSIVE AND TOLD HER TO SHUT UP THEN ONCE ALL THE STARTED TO BLOW UP LOUIS SAYS SOME OFFICERS STARTED TO COME TO HIM DISCREETLY AND TELL HIM THEY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT ANDERSON WHICH PROMPTED HIM TO TALLY UP EVERYTHING HE KNEW ABOUT ANDERSON THERE'S THE JULIS JOHNSON SHOOTING I TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME WHERE ANDERSEN KILLED AN ON ARM BLACK MAN THAT WAS BEFORE LOUIS ARRIVED IN MISKIGIN AND ANDERSEN WAS OFFICIALLY CLEARED OF ANY WRONG DOING BUT LOUIS QUESTION ANDERSENS JUDGMEN AND THE DECISIONS THAT HE MADE THAT LED TO THE SHOOTING HE ADDED ON TOP OF THAT TWO OTHER SHOOTINGS ANDERSEN WAS INVOLVED IN AN ADDITON TO JULIUS JOHNSON IF TOOK THE NATIONAL AVERAGE A I'VE BEEN A POLICE OFFICER FOR FORTY YEARS INVOLVED IN NO SHOOTINGS THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS GO THROUGH THEIR CAREER AN NEVER SHOOTING ONE OETHING THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT NOBODY KEEPS NATIONAL STATISTICS ON THE PERCENTAGE OF OFFICERS THAT SHOOT PEOPLE A PEW SAID HE SAYS ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF POLICE OFFICERS HAVE EVEN FIRED THEIR GUNS BUT THAT INCLUDES WARNING SHOTS AND SHOOTING ANIMALS ANYTHING ELSE WHON EXPERT TOLD US THE NUMBER OF POLICE WHO HAVE ACCUALLY SHOT AND KILLED SOME ONE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY LESS THAN ONE PERSENT I COULDNT EVEN FIND A STATISTIC WE'RE DEPARTMENT LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THREE SHOOTINGS AND THE IS AN OUTLIER IN THAT WAY YOU IVE BE LIKE EITHER YOU HAVE THE WORST LOCK SOMETHING'S GOING ON HERE AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOKED AT HIS HISTORY THERE WAS A PROGRESSIVE A I GUESS GLARING A PERFORMANCE WITH HIM WHEN IT CAME TO OU KNOW DEALING WITH AFRIC AMERICANS ESPECIALLY ANOTHER WORDS HE SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF PROMS WITH AFRICA MERICAS THROUGH HIS CAREER LOUIS SAID ANDERSON WOULD HAVE THESE KIND OF PROBLEMATIC INTERACTIONS WITH BLACK PEOPLE BUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE'D BE CLEARED FOUND TO BE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF DEPARTMENT POLICY HIS WHOLE CAREER THINGS WOULD HAPPEN AND HE WOULD CONNACMOT THE OTHER SIDE AND I'M NOT SURE WHY I MEAN NOT GIFT COBECKLOK OF EVERY INSITANT I'VE HAD OFFICERS A GOOND CORRECCENS AND LES SA YOU HAVEAN OFFICER THEIS IN FIVE CORRECCENS AND NONE WAS HIS FAULT AS A CHIEF YOU GO LO KE IT APPEERS IS NAT YOUR FAULT BUT WHY ARE YOU IN FIVE NOT A FAULT ACCENTS WHEN THE OTHER THAT I PERSENT THE OFFICERS ON HEAVENS WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT YOU KEEP GETTING AN ACCIDENTS IN IT OT OF FAULT YOU KNOW WE'D A MUCH BIG POLICARGA RACT WHICH NEVER FAULT CHUCK IS ONE OSE KIND F THINGS WERE IITS IS PASS TJIS GOOD THINGS IN HER M I TAKE THIR WAY FROM I START TO SEE AN A PATTERN THAT HE JUST WASN'T EFFECTIVE WITH OUR AFCAN MERICAN SISENCS HE JUST WASN'T SO LIKE WHAT HE GAN DO LOUIS SAYS HE KNEW PRETTY QUICKLY WHAT HE WAS GIN IT DIN HE WANTED TO FIR ANDERSN PARTLY ON PRINCIPL TUPLIS TO HIS FORY TOLD ME ANDERSEN HAS A PROBLEM WITH BLACK PEOPLE THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND BUT ALSO ON TOP OF THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE TELLING LOUIS HE HAD NO CHOICE HE HAD TO GET RID OF THIS OFFICER THE CITY'S SOCIAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE THE CITY'S VICE MAORE WHOS ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL END OF BOLICY P EVERY ONE WAS SAYING IF ANDERSON STAYED THERE'D BE BACK LASH PROTEST HOSTILITY AND NOT JUST TOWARDS ANDERSON BUT TOWARDS EVERY ONE ON THE FORCE SOULD 'N DANGER HIM AN OTHER SERVANT AT OFFICERS AND MATTER FACT I'M NOT CO BE PART OF HIS IGERSY IF THAT'S HOWRGIN O BE ITS I CAN NOT AND GOOD CONSCIOUS BRING HIM BACK HERE AND PUT HIM BACK ON THE STREETS OF THIS TOWN TSO AT THIS POINT IN OUR STORY YOU'VE GOT A TOWN WERE LOTS OF PEOPLE THINK O POLICE OFFICER HAS A PROBLEM WITH BLACK PEOPLE THE WHITE POLICE CHIEF LOOKS INTO IT AND AGREES  SEEMS LIKE A CLEAR CUT CASE FIRED THE OFFICER CALL OUT HIS BAD BEHAVIOR APOLOGIZED THE PUBLIC AND YET THAT'S NOT WHAT ENDS OF HAPPENING WHICH BRINGS US TACK TO THE WAY IT ACTUALLY HAPPEN TOUT OF THE BREAKING NEWS OUT OF THE SKIGIN WER A POLICE OFFICER WHO HAD WHO CLUCK CLANMEMROBILIAN AS ALL HAS BEEN FART WHEN THE NEWS HA THE CHIEF LOUIS DID WHAT HE SAID  AND FIRED OFFICER ANDERSON THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION WHY HE WAS FIRED  THE CLOSEST THEY GOT TO THAT CAME ELEVEN DAYS LATER WHEN THE CITY RELEASED THEIR OFFICIAL REPORT ON ANDERSON THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION CHIEF LOUIS ORDERED THIS REPORT IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I GOT INTERESTED IN THIS IT'S OVER OF FOUR HUNDRED PAGES SO IT SEEMS LIKE ITS GAING A BEE KIND OF A RECKIN IT OF THE KIND OF OFFICER ANDERSEN AD BENDERING IS TWO DECADES ON THE MESKIGAN POLICE FORCE AND CLUDE ALL THE INS IDENTS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT SETTLE SOME BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT THE KIND O OFFICER HE WAS BUT THE REPORT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT THE REPORT ALMOST ENTIRELY PERTRAYS OFFICER ANDERSON AS WELL A PRETTY GREAT POLICE OFFICER IT'S HUNDREDS OF PAGES CLEARING HIM OF WRONG DOING AND SHOWCASON THINGS HE DONE WELL IN HIS CAREER IT SO MUCH SO THAT THE FIRST TIME I READ IT I DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WAS USED AS JUSTIFICATION FOR ANDERSON BEING FIRED SO MUCH OF WHAT HAD COME UP AND WHAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT WASN'T EVEN ADDRESSE THERE'S AN ANALYSIS OF ANDERSEN'S TRAFFIC STOP SHOWING IT DID NOT APPEAR HE WAS TARGETING NON WHITE DRIVERS HERE'S A BIG SECTION ABOUT HIS COMMENDATIONS THERE'S TEN INTERVIEWS WITH OFFICERS WHITE AND NON WHITE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY THINK ANDERSON'S FAIR AND A GOOD OFFICER AND THEY WISH HE COULD COME BACK TO WORK SOME SEEM BOILER PLATE BUT OTHERS SEEM HEARTFELT ONE BLACK OFFICER WITHOUT PROMPTING TALKS ABOUT HOW ANDERSEN HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO HELP HIM AT WORK AND BEEN A GUEST AT HIS HOUSE HE'S BEEN YOUR HOUSE THE INVESTIGATOR ASKS HE HAS SAYS BLACK OFFICER HE HELP ME PUT A ROOF ON MY HOUSE AND HIS FATHER AND WHIFE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY AT MY HOUSE SO MANY OF THE THINGS THE CHIEF FOUND SO DISTURBING THAT CONVINCED HIM ANDERSON HAD A PROBLEM WITH BLACK PEOPLE THEY JUST WEREN'T IN THERE LIKE THE VIDY OF HIM PUSHING THE OLD WOMAN ON TO THE GROUND OR LOUIS 'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ANDERSON SHOT THE ONLY INTERVIEW WHERE ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT ANDERSON I'S THE INTERVIEW WITH THE MOFFICES AND THEY ONLY TALK ABOUT THE FLAGS AN THE CKCA APPLICATION THE LOCAL ACTAVIST EBONY DAVIS SUMMED UP THE REPORT  THIS WAY HE WAS A GREAT OFFICER HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG BUT HAVE MEMOROBELIA AND THEY FIRED HIM TO KEEP US HAPPY SO HOW DID WE GET TO THIS FROM A POLICE CHIEF WHO BELIEVES THIS OFFICER HAS AE PROBLEM WITH BLACK PEOPLE TO THIS MAMMOTHS REPORT THAT DOESN'T SAY THAT AT ALL CHIEF LOUIS 'S INVESTIGATORS HANDED HIM A REPORT THAT COMES TO VERY DIFFERENT CONCLU SIONS THAN HE HAD IT'S THE REPORT YOU'D ISSUE IF HE WANTED TO KEEP ANDERSON ON THE STREETS I NEVER GOT IN ANSWER TO WHY THE REPORTIS JUST AS LOTATORY STUFF I ASKD TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE INVESTIGATION N THE CITY SAID NO AS CHIEF LOUIS SURPRISINGLY HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT THE REPORT WAS CRITICAL HONESTLY IT SEEMED LIKE HE HADN'T READ IT IN A WHILE ANDMAYBE DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE HACK HAD HAPPENE INSIDE MISKEGAN CITY GOVERNMENT THEY COULD POSSIBLY CONNECT THOSE DOBS THE BEST ANSWER I GOT IS HERE ENACT THREE HOW TO FIRE A POLICE OFFICER OKE LET'S GO BACK TO THAT MOMENT WHEN CHIEF LOUIS DECIDED HE WANTED TO FIRE ANDERSON NOT BECAUSE OF THE OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION HE HADN'T EVEN SEEN THAT YET HE WANTED TO FIRE ANDERSON BECAUSE OF HIS OWN ANALYSIS AFTER HE DECIDED THAT HE MET WHAT THE CITIES LAWYERS AND THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW IT WOULD BE TRICKY TO FIRE ANDERSON AND BE TRICKY BECAUSE OF THE REASON LOUIS WANTED TO GET RID OF HIM IT TARD TO PROVE A POLICE OFFICER TREATS BLACK PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY AND HAS A PATTERN OF DISCRIMINATING THEY SAID IF LOUIS TRIED TO FIRE HIM FOR THAT HE REALLY MIGHT FAIL LIKE TAKE THE VIDIO OF ANDERSON SHOVING THE OLD WOMAN ANDERSEEN TO ARGUE IT WAS JUSTIFIED OR MAYBE WAS AN ACCIDEN TAKE ANY OF THESE INCIDENTS ONE BY ONE HE COULD SAY THAT THERE WAS SOME REASON CAUS HERE'S ALWAYS A DEFENSE MISTER ANDERSON HAD A DEFENSE MISTER ANDERSON HAD REPRESENTATION CHIEF LOUIS AYS HE CALLED AROUND TO OTHE POLICE CHIEFS THE POLICE UNION OFFICIALS BEFORE AROUND THE STATEOP YE WENT YOU'LL NEVER SUSTAIN THAT AN IN THE UNION WORLD I WAS TOLD BY A LOT OF PEOPLE MY DE CISION WAS TO TERMINATE THAT IT WOULD NOT BUUSTAE THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION I WOULD I'D PROABLY LOSE IT LATER ON DOWN DOWN THE ROAD IT IT HAPPENES I MEE THERE IS IT JUST SINCE I' BEEN HO WOULD SAY THERE'S PROBALY THREE DIFFERENT TIMES PEOPLE BEEN FIRED AND AWARDED THEIR JOB'S FACK MISKEGIN CITY MANDADG YOR FRANK PETERSON HE WAS IN THESE MEETINGS WITH CHIEF LOUIS AND MISKIGAN'S LAWYERS AND WE JUST DID NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IN THIS CASE SOME OF THE CASES WERE OCAY WITH IT YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW BUT THIS ONE WAS LIKE UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE COULD BE AFOR TO HAVE HIM BE AWARDED HIS JOB BACK IT'S HARD TO FIRE A POLICE OFFICER THAT'S TO PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY AS HE PROBABLY KNOW POLICE UNIONS ARE POWERFUL THEY'V LOT TO PROTECTIONS IN THEIR CONTRACTS AND THE INSTANCES WHERE POLICE OFFICERS DO GET FIRED FOR RACISM THERE' BEEN A BUNCH O CASES OVER THE LAST COULE YERS  WILMINGTON NORTH CAROLINA ALBANY NEW YORK WOR IN MICHIGAIN AND THE THING IS IN ALL THOSE CASES POLICE WERE NOT FIRED FROM HIS TREATING PEOPLE OF COLOR ON THE JOB THEY WERE FIRED FOR THINGS THEY SET BECAUSE THEY WRIGHT RACEIS COMMENTS ON LINE WHERE THEY GET CAUGHT ON A RECORTING SAYING EXPLICITLY RACEIS THINGS THERE'S A CAUGHT RED HANDEDNESS TO IT AND THE WAY THOSE DEPARTMENTS FIRED THE OFFICERS WAS BY ARGUING THE RACES COMMENTS VIOLATED THE BASIC COT OF CONDUCT FOR THEIR JOBS LIKE THE COTE OF ATHICS AND WILMINGTON SAYS OFFICERS CAN'T DO THINGS THAT REFLECT ON FAVORABLY ON THE DEPARTMENT OR THEMSELVES AND CHIEF LOUIS AFTER PUZZLING FOR A WHILE OVER WHAT LEGAL ARGUMENT HE COULD USE TO FIRE ANDERSON HE HAD KIND OF AN AHAMOMENT AN H CONT A STUMBLED INTO A STRATEGY LIKE THAT LIKE THE OTHER CITYES USED IN OUR PULST PROCEEDURES ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU YOURSELF HAVE TO HAVE THE COMMUNITY TRUST IF YOUS IN OUR PULST PROCEEDURES THE COMMUNTY HAS T HAVE SOME KOND OF TRUST YOU TO CURRY OUT YOUR DUTIES I LOOKED IT UP AND INDEED THIS WAS IN SOME TACHNICALITY VERID DEEP IN DEPARTMENT POLICY E WAS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING IN THE CHIEF'S PREFACE THAT LOUISE RODE HIMSELF HE REFERS TO THE PUBLIC TRUST WHEN LOUIS TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS HIS ARGUMENT AND HE WAS GOING TO TRY TO FIRE ANDERSON FOR LOSING THE PUBLICS TRUST I COULD NOT HELP UT THINK IF THIS WAS THE BAR EVERY WERE FOR EVERY OFFICER A LOT O OFFICERS WOULD BE FIRED TOMORROW THE'S AND HALF OF AMERICAN SAY THEY HAVE CONFIDENTS IN POLICE THESE DAYS ONE BENEFIT OF THIS STRATEGY WAS SIMPLICITY ALL THEY HAD TO PROVE WAS THAT ANDERSON HAD THE STUFF IN HIS HOUSE AND THE PEOPLE SAID HE COULDN'T BE TRUSTED BECAUSE OF IT LOUIS WOULDN'T HAVE TO ARGUE ALL THESE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENS THAT THE LAWYERS TOLD HIM HE MIGHT LOSE OHN ANOTHER APPEALING THING ABOUT THIS PLAN IT'D BE FAST LOUIS WANTED TO SEND TO MESSAGE BY ACTING QUICKLY AND IN FACT FROM THE DAY THE MAFFICES POSTED HET WAS ONLY FIVE WEAKS INTILL ANDERSON WAS FIRE AMAZINGLY QUICK FOR THIS KIND OF THING BUT TO MAKETURE ANDERSON WOULDN'T FIGHT HIM AND TRY TO GET HIS JOB BACK THE CHIEF DID SEEMD TO GIVE A FEW THINGS AWAY AT THE BARGANING TABLELEY FOR STARTERS HE DIDN'T REALLY FIRE ANDERSON IN ACTUALITY ANDERSON SIGNED A SEPARATION AGREEMENT HE AGREED TO WALK AWAY VOLUNTARILY NOT SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THE CITY NOT SO TO KEEP HIS JOB IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE OVER IN EXCHANGE THE CITY WOULD LET HIM LEAVE WITH HIS PENSION AND RETIREMENT HELD CARE BENEFINTS AFTER TWO DECADES ON THE JOB THIS STRATEGY FOR GETTING RID OF A POLICE OFFICER IS NOT UNUSUAL A FORMER POLICE CHIEF NAMED DANIEL OATS WROTE AN ARTICLE IN THE WASHINGTON POST WHERE HE SAID IN NINE YEARS RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT IN A ROR COLORADO HE HAD SIXTEEN COBS HE WANTED TO FIRE HE ONLY FIRED FOUR OF THEM HE WAS REVERSED ON THREE OF THOSE SO WUT THE OTHER TWELVE HE SAYS HE QUOTE BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO NEGOTIATE THEIR DEPARTURES WITH CREATIVE SEVERENCE PACKAGENS NOT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO HE FELT HE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE CITY AND OFFICER ANDERSON THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT ANDERSON'S HISTORY DID COME UP BUT HIS KIND OF LIKE A BARGAINING CHIM LOUIS TOLD ME HE MADE IT CLEAR TO ANDERSON AND THE UNIONSHAT THE CASE FOR HIS TERMINATION WAS BASED ON WHAT WAS IN HIS HOUSE AND HOW HE LOST THE PUBLIC TRUST  BUT HE SAID IF ANDERSON FOUGHT THAT MOST IT COULD BECOME ABOUT A LOT MORE NISTER IT COULD BECOME ABOUT ANDERSON'S PAST AND OTHER THINGS THAT HE DONE YOU KNOW AND SO I WAS I WAS PREPARED TO SHOW THIS PATTERN THI HAD OTHER COMPLAINS TE WOR LIKE IN THE HOPPER THAT WERE COMING FORTH THAT I WAS GOING TO QUIRE IN THOSE VAXT IN THE UNION KNEW IT OH IF YOU WIN THIS ONE THIS HAS COME NEXT THEN THIS COULD BECOME NEXT AND SO THAT'S WHY I WAS DECIDED WE WOULD JUST IN THIS RELATIONSHIP AND HE WOULD MOVE ON IN OTHER WORDS IF ANDERSON TOOK THIS DEAL THE CITY WOULDN'T DIG IN TO THEXT STUFF ANDERSON TO WALK AWAY WITHOUT A REAL RECKONING OVER HIS PAST THAT'S THE BEST EXPLANATION I HAVE FOR WHY THE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE PAGE REPORT IS THE WAY IT IS AND WHY IT DOESN'T REALLY DIG IN TO ANDERSON'S MISTREATMENT OF PEOPLE I SHOULD MENTION IN HIS PREFASE TO THE REPORT THE CHIEF PROMISES MORE HE SAIS THERE W'LL BE FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO ADDITIONAL COMPLAINTS AGAINST OFFICER ANDERSON'S BEHAVIOR ON THE JOB NOW THAT THIS PART TON THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN THOUGH AND IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS THE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMEN TOLD ME THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS IN TO ANDERSON IN THE WORKS   BANCOHIN COMING OUT THE WAY THE CITIES DEAL WITH OFFICER ANDERSON AFFECTED MATHISES WHO WOKE THAT THAT FOUR HUNDRER TWENTY WONE PAGE REPORT IV HAD SOMETHING TOTALLY SURPRISING ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THAT THAT'S A MENUTE SCAGOPUBLIGRADIO WHENT ON PROGRAMME CONTINUES THIS A SMARICAN LIFE OM OR A GLASS WITH OUR STORY ABOUT POLICING A MUSKUIGAN MICHIGAN TO DAY'S EPISODE A CITY WALKS INTO AN INVESTIGATION SO IM THE POLICE CHIEF MADE A TRADE OFF HEBELIEVED OFFICER ANDERSON HAD PROB BLACK PEOPLE HE BELIEVED A COMPLETELY AFFECTED THE WAY HE DID HIS JOB BUT HE THOUGHT HE COULDN'T FIRE HIM FOR IT SO HE FORCED HIM OUT FOR QUOTE LOSING THE PUBLICS TRUST WITH THAT CCE CE OPLICATION ATD IS PART OF THE DE O THE CITY'S OFFICIAL FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PATRE PORT DID NOT SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOT OUT ANDERSON TREATED BLACK PEOPLE ON HIS JOB THAT TRADE OFF ANDERSON AT WEEVE BUT HE KEPT HIS PENSION THE CITY'S OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION WUR TRADED TO MIS A OUTSTANDING OFFICER THAT TRADE OFF HAD CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEOPLE WHOSE FACE BOOK POST BEGAN ALL OF US THE MATHISIS AND FOR OTHERS BANKOF HIN PICKS UP WITHOUT FOR PEOPLE WHO GOT THE SHORT END OF ANDERSON STEALE BEST I CAN TELL THE PUBLIC AT LARGE JUST KIND OF ACCEPTED WITH THE CITY DID ANDERSON WAS GONE MAYBE HE GRUMBLED THAT HE GOT HIS PENSION BUT FINE OQET BUT IT WASN'T THAT WAY FOR DUKE'S STALLING AT ALL JUST HAVE REMIND YOU OF HIS EXPERIENCE WITH OFFICER ANDERSON ANDERSON WAS CALLED TO HIS MAMM'S BIRTHDAY PARTY BECAUSE OF A NOISE COMPLAINT AND ASCALATED THINGS UNTIL HE ENDED A PEPPERSPRING A BUNCH OF OLD PEOPLE AN ARRESTING DUKE IN ONE OF HIS UNCLES THEY FILED COMPLAINTS WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT A TRIED TO RAISED THE ALARM ABOUT ANDERSON BUT NOTHING HAPPENE KNOW NEVER REACHED OUT TO HEAR THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY YEARS LATER WHEN THE MATHISIS CAME FORWARD ABOUT THE STUFF IN ANDERSON'S HOUSE DUKE THOUGHT FINALLY EVERY ONE'S GON TO SEE BUT THE WAY THE CITY HANDLED IT IT DIDN'T GO THAT WAY BECAUSE THE CITY'S REPORT DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE PATTERN ANDERSON HAT WITH BLACK PEOPLE WHAT WOULD IT HAVE MEANT TO YOU IF THE POLICE CHIEF AS PART OF THIS PROCESS WOULD HAVE SAID LIKE ESSENTIALLY HE HAD THE SKY WAS A PROBLEM OH EVERYTHING OH MY MY HOPE WAS THAT THEY WAS ONE LOOKING TO MARCASE AGAN WHOLE RIGHT INNOCENT NAEVENESS I HOPE THAT THEY REACH OUT TO ME HOP THEY LOOK INTO MARCASE HOP THEY LOOKIN SO JULIAU'S CASE HOPE THEY LOOK INTO ALL THESE CASES AN SOMETHING REALLY HAPPENS AND ANHE GO TO THE FAMILIES AND MAKE A MANS WITH THESE FAMILIES THAT HE TERRIZE THOT WE YOURE OPING THAT YOU ARE GOINGTOG GOT FONCO OEN MOST EPHON I THOUGHT THAT'S WOHATD INVESCASION IS YOU GON LOOKINTO EVERY SITUATION THAT HE HAD A YOU KNOW ANT INTERACTION WAS BUT THE INVESTICATION HEY SAY WAS ONL HAVE THAT WAS JUST TO GET US HOPEFUL RIGHT GULDS PEOPLE HOPEFUL SOTN'T YOU RID AN ANGER SAW POISE CAN BE ON THE STREETS WHIT O NOBODY ONE TO DOING THINGS TO OUR POLICES WELL SAY EVERYTHING WE NEED TO SAY TO MAKE THEM COME DOWN THASSIT HAT'S REALY ALSO ABOUT IT'S A WEIRD THING ABOUT THE STORY ALL THAT STUFF THAT CHIEF LEUIS SAID TO ME ABOUT HOW HE WAS CONVINCED THAT OFFICER ANDERSON HAD PROBLEM WITH BLACK PEOPLE AND A PATTERN OF INCIDENTS MIS TREATING THEM HE'S NEVER SAID THAT PUBLICLY NOT IN THE REPORT NOT IN COMMENTS TO THE PRESS NO CITY OFFICIAL HAS SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT NOT UNTIL NOW THIS STORY SO I WAS THE ONE TO BREAK THAT TO PEOPLE LIKE DUKE'S STALLING SO I MEAN THAT WOULD HA MAKE ME FOR A WHOLE LA BETTER IF YOU KNOW HE WOULD HAVE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAY TO YOU BEHIND CLOSED ORS AN PUBLIC ABOUT THIS OFFICER TO HEAR THAT COMES FROM WITH IN THAT YOU AGREED AND YOU FELT THE SAME WAY YOU KNOW HE HAD A HISTORY OF YOU KNOW A HERTIN OR EFFECTING MAND AS SAD GROUP OF PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW WE FIRED HIM AND GOT RID ON BECAUSE IT HAV REASON YOU KNOW TO LET US KNOW THAT WE ON E SAYING PAGE HER I MEAN THAT'S HOW YOU BUILD AT TRUST WITH THE COMMUNITY WHEN IT CAME TO THE WAY THAT ANDERSON TREATED HIS FAMILY DUKE OULD ALWAYS FELT THAT RACE WAS A PART OF IT THEY DID HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY IF THEY WERE WHITE BUT IT WAS THIS SLIPPERY PART AND IT WAS HARD TO PROVE TWHICH HAPPENS ALL THE TIME  PERSON ACCUSED OF RACES M CAN SAY I DON'T HAVE A RACE HIS PON IN MY BODY OR I'M THE LEAST RACE'S PERSON AND THEN ALL OFTHE SUDDEN CONVERSATION IS THIS DEAD END EVERY ONE'S JUST MUST THROW UP THEIR HANDS AND BE LIKE GUESS YEU CAN'T PROVE WITS IN THEIR HEART THIS WI IN EVERYTHAN YES I'VE KNOW WHAT IN A ROAST I YOU KNOW I OFFICES SELF LIKE THAT WOULD TE AND O KNOW WAS A RACEAL BAG BUT I COULDN'T TAKE IT TO COURT AND WE AM BECAUSE THEY NEVERS MISSTIFILY YOU KNOW SAY AYTHING LIKE THAT LI YOU REALLY OT A CAUSE OMBODY AN YOU LEARELY GOT O LITIES I THANGS IN ORDERI CAN TREAT YOU LIKE AN UT NEVER CALLY I CAN TREAT YOU LIKE ONE NEVER QUILE YOU THED YOUCAY ESITON ON RACES BUT YOU KNEWL WAS KNE WAS YOU YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE A TRAP DOOR AND TEN YEARS EARLIER DUKE OULD WATCHED ANDERSON SLIPPED THROUGH IT AND WHEN THE CITY RELEASED THEIR REPORT IT WAS LIKE HE HAD TO WATCH ANDERSON SLIPPED THROUGH IT FOR A SECOND TIME EI WENT BACK AND I TOLD CHIEF LOUIS WULD DUKE ANOTHER SAID TO ME THAT IF THE CITY AND LOUIS SAW A RACIAL PATTERN OF BAD CONDUCT AND MISTREATMENT BY OFFICER ANDERSON THE CITY SHOULD HAVE SET IT HONESTLY AND I SEE WHER THE CON FRO I IGET BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR US TO DO THE INVESTIGATION I FELT I BUT EVERYTHING IN THERE TO SUSTAIN THIS CASE AND TO GET HIM TO END HIS EMPLOYMENT HERE TO GET THE OUTCOME THAT YOU FELT LIKE WAS IMPORTANCE FOR THIS AND IND I CAN PROVE IT TO DAY I CAN LOOK BACK GU SEE WE DID IT RIGHT  BUT THERE CAN SOM MISSES SHOULD SAY IT'S NOT COMPLETE UNTILL THE CHIEF PUT THE RACESYOU

AS AVINENCE HE SAID BECAUSE THAT'LL SEE EXACTLY WHAT HAT EVERYBODY WASL SEE WHAT HAPPENED THE MALFASES SAY THEIR LAWYER REQUESTED THE DASH CAMP FOOTED FROM THE STOP ACCORDING TO THE MATHASES THEY WERE TOLD THE VIDIO COULD NOT BE LOCATED AND THEN SUDDENLY RAYNA WAS OFFERED AND KNEW MUCH REDUCED PLEA DEAL SHE DECIDED SHE JISWANTED TO BE DONE WITH ALL THIS AND SHE TOOK IT  UT THE NIGHT OF THE TRAFFIC STOP BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ATE ROBIN RYNOND DID NOT THINK IT WAS ABOUT RACE DON'T LIKE AG JUST BEING A DIG OR HE'S HAD A HARD MIGD MAYBE O TE THE PREVIOUS PERSON MAY BE POOLED OVER SOMETHING GAVE AHARD TIME AND YOU KNOW HE JUST TAKEN OU ON EVERYBODY ELSE YOU KNOW HE'S OWN A POWERTRI YOU KNOW  I HAVE A BADE OM I'M ON TI CONTROL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I DIN'T THINK ANYTHING ABOUT HIM BE IN BRACES I JUST THOUGHT YE HE WAS A COP ON A PORTRIP I MEAN I'VE SEEING MEXICAN COPS DO THE SAME THING TO MEXICANS AND BLACK COPS DO THE SAME THING TO BLACKS IT'S JUST YOU KNOW SOME OF EM HAVE THEIR POWER TRIPS SO I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS ON A POETRIP THAT WAS HOW THEY SOUGHIT WHEN IT HAPPENED BUT NOW AFTER SEEING THE S THINGS IN ANDERSEN'S HOME A DECAE LATER THEY BOTH LOOKED AT IT DIFFERENTLY I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE DID THAT WITH A WITH A WHITE CUB WUNIKAR HE EN LIK OKA GO USE BATHROOM OR OM IS GOING LETS YOU OFF CAUSE HE WAS JUST JUST JIS RESPECT IN HIND SLIGHT LOOKING AT IT EVERYTHING HE DID WAS A RACEIS ACT FROM WHEN HE FIRST LOOKED AT US HEE DIDN'T HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS TICS A MAN IS RACEES AND I KNOW THAT NOW BUT HAD I KNOWN IT BACK THEN PROBABLY BEEN ALADED SO THEN I WAS PISSED I CITNAT I D WISH I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY ASSAULTED HIM BEFORE AASULTED ME THAT'S THE TRUTH IF THE CITY SPECIFICALLY CHIEFLEWIS WOULD HAVE SAID PUBLICLY SOME VERSION OF WHAT HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT OFFICER ANDERSEN THAT HE HAD A PATTERN OF BEING OVERLY AGGRESSIVE ESCOLATING SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T WHITE THEN I THINK WHEN PEOPLE FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS TRAFFIC STOP THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT IN THAT LITE BUT WITHOUT THAT CONTAXT ANDERSON'S VERSION IS THE ONE PEOPLE BELIEVED IT'S ANDERSEN'S ACCOUNT IN THAT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PAGE REPORT THE CITY ISSUED HE STOPPED ROBIN RAYNA RAYN GOT OUT OF HAND SHE ASSAULTAT HIM BECAUSE OF THAT THIS REVELATION THAT THEY'D HAD THIS RUN IN WITH OFFICER ANDERSEN YEARS EARLIER IT REALLY DID CHANGE HOW LOTS OF PEOPLE SAW THEM ATHISIS THAT'S WHEN MORE THREATS CAME AND THER PEOPLE SIN ALL YEAR YOU ARE OUT FOR OFFICER ANDERSON BECAUSE HE PUT YOUR WIFE IN YER BECAUSE IT S BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW THEN MAY WAS LIKE ALL YOUR MIGHT JUST A GOOD GAT BECAUSE YOU OUHT IT OFFICER ANDERSON FOR HAVING A COFEDERATE FAG IN A CLAN APPLICATION THIS BECAUSE WE WERE HOLDING A GRODS AGAINST THE POLICE OFFS OF COURSE ROBIN RAYNA HADN'T SOUGHT OUT ANDERSEN'S HOUSE ON SOME BENDETTA THE REALTER SENT THEM THE LISTING BUT THIS VERSION OF THE STORY TOOK HOLD THAT'S WAS STILL OUTIT THAT THAT REPORT THAT A CITY HAL PUT OUT IT'S ME AN MY WIFE HAD A PROBE WE IN WE WENT AFTER  WHEN WE WERE TALKING I TOLD ROB WHAT CHIEF LEUIS SAID TO ME THAT ANDERSEN HAD A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR AND A PROBLEM WITH BLACK PEOPLE JUST LIKE WOULD DUKE STALLING ROBIN HAD NO CLUE NO CLUE LOUIS FELT THAT WAY NO CLUE LOUIS SAW THE SAME THINGS IN ANDERSEN THAT HE DID AND THE FACT THE CITY LEFT THAT OUT IT MADE ROB MAD WHY WHEL YOU SAY THAT IN THE REPORT IN THE BEGIN YIT WOULD AV CHANGED EVERYTHING EVERYTHING ME AN MY WIFE WOULDN'T BE LOOKED IY AS SOME LIARS THAT WE WOULT AFTER YOU YOU SOON UP HERE CREANE IS FALSENESS YOU KNOW IT IS JUST ROOM TELL THE TRUTH MANAGE POLICE SHE WANT TO TELL THE TRUTH BUT THE MATTERIS DONE WHAT TRUTHFULLY THE INFIMATION THAT SHOU JUST GOT FROM CHIEF LEWIS IF THAT WOULDNAVE BEEN PUT INTO REPORT THEN TEY WOULD SAY THE MAS YART HE IN A GREAT JOB YOU KNOW THANK YOU THE WAY THE MATHESIS SEE IT EVEN IF THE CHIEF REMOVED ANDERSEN FOR BETRAYING THE PUBLIC STRUST EVEN IF THE REASON FOR THE FIRING WASN'T THE WAY HE TREATED BLACK PEOPLE THE CITY COULD HAVE REMOVED ANDERSON WITHOUT ALSO GIVING HIM A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH THE CUT A SAID WE'VE LOOKED INTO THIS WERE TROUBLED BY THE WAY HE TREATS PEOPLE IT WAS NOT OKA WE DON'T WANT OFFICERS ACTING THE WAY THAT HE DID AC SIX WAS IT WORTH  IT'S HARD FOR ROBIN RAYN HAD TO COUT CULATE THE WAYS THIS CHANGED THEIR LIVES THE RIST THEY TOOK WAS A SINGLE ACT A SINGLE MOMENT BUT THE IMPACT OF IT IS STILL HAPPENING EVEN A COUPLE YEARS LATER THE COST FOR THEM ARE STILL ADDING UP SOME OF WHAT ALL THIS HAS COST THE MATHTHIS IS ARE THINGS THAT HAVE ENDED UP IN NO REPORT NO INVESTIGATION OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL THE HARASS MEN THE THREATS THE CONSPIRACY THEORY NOW FLOATING ROUND OUT THERE THE ROBIN RAYNA WERE OUT TO GET OFFICER ANDERSON THE LAST TIME I SAW ROB I ASKED HIM HOW HE LOOKS BACK ON ALL TIT GIVEN THE RESULT I'M JUST GLAD THAT YE RAN ROUND THE STREETS HE'S NOT RAST NO MORE MINE WORDIES AND NOBODY  WILL GET KULED BY ALLS ERNESY ITUD BE A JUSTIFIA SHOOT CAUSE HE CAN MAKE AP WOULD HE WANT TO BECAUSE HE KILLED O PORSE SO YOU DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT WAS WORTH IT I'LL FEEL LIKE US I ME  MY WIFE SAVE LIVES BUT NON WILL WE DE RAYNDA DIDN'T DISAGREE SHOOSE GLAD ANDERSON LOST THIS JOB REALLY PRETTY FAST THAT TOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN BUT THE PRACTICAL COST SHE CAN HELP IT LOOK AT THOSE TOO THE THEN WITH ALL THU A BACK LASH THAT WAS N THAT YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE NEGATIVE STUFF IT JUST MADE ME SECOND GUESS WHAT WE DID YOU KNOW LIKE I FELT LIKE I DID SUT MOT WRONG LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T DIDT MAYBE WE SHOULD IS KEPT OUR MOUTH SHUT BUT THAT THE END OF THE DAY WHO AS TO SAY THAT HE WOULDN'T STILL BE WORKIN IN ANOTHER YOUNG BLACK MAN GETS KILLED OR THEREIS ANOTHER RAYNA WHO GOES TO PRISON FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT SHE ASSAULTED HIM AND YOU KNOW IT IT I I'M SO COMPLICT BECAUSE ONE MINUT I'M LIKE YOU KNOW WE DID DO THE RIGHT THING WE DID DO THE RIGHT THING BUT THEN WHEN YOU GO THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE BEEN GOIN THROUGH ITS KIND HARD LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULD KNOW THOUGH ROBIN RAYNAH DID WHAT THEY DID OUT OF CONCERN FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S SAFETY BUT THEY ENDED UP SACRIFICING THEIR OWN LIKE THEY USED TO FEEL LIKE THE POLICE ROUT THERE TO PROTECT THEM TIT HELP THEM AND NOW ON ANY GIVEN DAY THE WORRIED THAT THEIR NOT HERE'S RAYNA I PROMISE YOU EVERY DAY I LEAVE THIS HOUSE WHEN I DRIVED TO WORK I PRAY TO GOD THAT I DON'T GET PULLD OVER BECAUSE I'M SCARED I'M LEGAL I HAVE A LICENSE I HAVE INSURANCE AND I'M SCARED E MAKE ROB DRIVE ME TO WORK ALOT AND IT'S HARD ON HIM BECAUSE HE HAS TO WAKE UP TO COME GET ME AT FIVE IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW AND THEN TAKE MY DAUGHTER TO SCHOOL AND DO THIS AND DO THAT AND BUT I MY ANXI TO GET SO BAT I DON'T WANTO DAV CAUSE I'M SCARED HIM TO GET PULLED OVER AND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IT MIGHT BE SOMEBODY WHO KNEW HIM W RIGHT OR ONE OF HIS FRIENDS THOSE WORRIES AN FEARS THEY TELL ME THEY AREN'T JUST WHEN THEY LEAVE THE HOUSE THEY'VE SEEPED IN THE LAST THING I'LL PLAY FOR YOU IS FROM RAYNA THIS WAS FROM FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE CITY AD TERMINATED ANDERSON WHEN MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN MESKIGAN HAD STOPPED THINKING ABOUT ALL THIS IM I PROBABLY GET TWO THREE HOURS SLEEP HERE AND THERE ONCE WE STARTED GET IN THE THRATS AND IM BUT SO I I HAD A LOT OF BAD DREAMS YOU KNOW I COULDN'T SLEEP I WOULD HAVE TO I USED TO PUT A CHAIR RIHT BY THAT WINDOW WAND JUST SET OUT AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOW IN THE DARK JUST SO I COULD SEE IM TIS TO KEEP AN IYON WHAT WAS GOING O YEOUTND THAT WE HAVE A MONITUR WITH OUR SECURITY CAMERALS AND I WOULD LAY IT AND MY BED WITH ME AND I WOULD JUST HOLD IT AND WATCH IT FOR OURS CAUSE IT SHOWS ALL OF OUR CAMERELS IS ALL SIX SO I'D WATCH ALL THE LITTLE SCRANS AND FOR HOURS I COULDN'T SLEEP AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO AND HOW LONG DID THAT LAST I STILL DO IT SOMETIMES I DON'T SIT THERE NO MORE BUT I WILL SIT HERE ERE OR I WILL LAY IN MY BAT AN I'LL HOLD THE MONITOR RIGHT IN MY HAND IN HIS LASTNOUBEN HE WAS SOMETIMES TE OR I SET ON THE STAIRS RIGHT THERE AT THE FORTH STAIR SO I CAN SEE RIGHT OUT THAT NIGHT WHEN MI WORSE LIGHT IS ON SLI SENT THERE I TEXTED ROB THE OTHER DAY HE TOLD ME THEY STILL GET THRATD SOMETIMES AND THEY STILL WATCH THE MONITORS REGULARLY THAT'S THE NORMNAW HE WROTE RALWAYS ON GUARD I GAN WONG I THINK O ON THEM FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS AS BANCOVON IS EEN MORKING ON THIS STORY HE AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND THE THING THAT I HAVE WONDERED ABOUT MYSELF ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING THIS WHOLE TIME WAS OKET IF YOU ARE A POLICE OFFICER WITH THE HISTERY LIKE OFFICER ANDERSONS ALL THESE INTRACTIONS WITH CEVILIANS A GOO BADLY OVER TWENTY ONE YEARS WHY DID IT TAKE THIS FREEK EVET PEOPLE SPOTTING A CA C KEOPLICATION ON A WALL FOR ANYBODY WOOK TO IS RECORD THE WAY THE CHIEFTED IT IS SOMETHING ABOUT HEM COULDN'T THEY HAVE FLAGGED HIM SOONER ACROSS THE COUNTRY RE WE SETHSE INCIDENTS WERE POLICE ARE MISTREATING PEOPLE IT SEEMS LIKE IF THERE WERE SOME SYSTEM TO CATCH PROBLEM OFFICERS IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE DOES ANY POLICE DEPARTMENT TRY IN A REAL WAY AN AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT FLAG THEM DEAL WITH THEM AOTHER BEN I SO I WAS NOT A ONE IN THIS QUESTION YOU ALSO WERE CONE OF OBSESS WITH US YET I PUT THIS QUESTION THIS EXACT QUESTION TO SEVERAL POLICING EXPERTS A AND EVENTUALLY ONE OF THEM TOLD ME ABOUT THESE THINGS CALLED EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS AH AND BASICALLY WHAT THESE ARE ARE COMPUTER PROGRAMES THAT TRACK PROBLEMATIC INCIDENS IN AN OFFICERS CAREER A AND THEY FLAG AN OFFICER IF THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM AND ONE OF TESE EXPERTS TOLD ME THAT IF MESKIGAN HAVE ONE OF THESE SYSTEMS THEND ALL OF THIS WOULD HAV BEEN DIFFERENT A A YET RIGHT BUT THEN I CHECKD AND MESKIGAN DOES HAVE ONE OF THESE SYSTEMS IN PLACE OH IT DOES IT DOES BUT ID YOU KNOW DIDN'T LEAD TO ANY ACTION AGAINST OFFICER ANDERSEN OKA THEN WHAT'S HE PROBLEM WELL I MEAN IT TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE JUST REALLY BAD A AND THERE'S A FEW REASONS FOR IT ONE OF THEM IS THAT SOME OF THE SYSTEMS THIS INCLUDES MISKIGANS THEY RELY REALLY HEAVILY ON POLICE OFFICERS RE PORTING EACH OTHER ON WHICH DOES IT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN IT REALIES ON CITIZEN COMPLAINTS A WHICH WE JUST KNOW THAT PEOPLE DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT POLICE OFFICERS VERY OFTEN BECAUSE THEY WORRY THAT NOTHINGS CAN BE DONE WHICH IS TRUE OFTEN RIGHT YET TOTALLY TRUE AH ANOTHER REASON THEI'RE BAD IS THAT A WHEN THESE SYSTEMS GET INSTALLED A THEY HAVE TO BE NEGOTIATED WITH POLICE UNIONS AND POLICE UNIONS KIND OF DEFANG THEM A AND THE LAST REASON IT TURNS OUT THEY MIGHT BE MEASURING JUST THE WRONG THINGS AH SO A FEW YEARS AGO A A GROUP AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO GOT TOGETHER AND THEY WANTED TO CHANGE THE WAY THIS WORKS BASICALLY THEY WANTED TO MONEY BALL THE WHOLE SITUATION THY WERE TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE THINGS POLICE DO ON THE JOB INTO NUMBERS AND STATISTICS AND THEN THEY WANTED TO FIND THE STATS THAT BEST PREDICT BAD BEHAVIOR SOG MAN EXAMPLE OF OF WHAT THESE MONEYBOFLSTATS WOULD BE OKET SO ONE EXAMPLE A THEY SAY THE OLD SYSTEMS WOULD MEASURE JUST THE SHEER NUMBER OF TIMES A POLICE OFFICER WOULD USE FORCE SO LIKE IF THEY WRESTLE SOMEBODY TO THE GROUND OR IF THEY TASTE SOMEBODY A AND WHAT THEY WANT INSTEAD THEY SAY IT TELLS YOU JUST WAY MORE IF YOU MEASURE SOMETHING THEY CALL PROPORTIONALITY OF FORCE AND WHAT THAT IS IS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH FORCE IS A POLICE OFFICER USING GIVEN THE SITUATION THAT THERE IN AH ARE THEY USING FORCE IN A SITUATION THAT WOULDN'T USUALLY CALL FOR IT O WE CAN LIKE THINK OF OFFICER ANDERSON GOING INTO THE BACK YARD AND ENDING UP PEPPER SPRAYING A BUNCH OF UNARMED PEOPLE OVER A NOISE COMPLAINT OVERNOISE COMPLAINT OR OR SHOVING THAT OLD WOMAN OF THE GROUND THAT'S USING A LOT OF FORESE WERE FORCES NECESSARILY NEEDET RIGHT EXACTLY UM SO I TALK TO A POLICING EXPERT NAME BRON CUPER MEN HE'S A FORMER CHICAGO POLICE OFFICER AND HE'S ONE OF THE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO USE THESE NEW MONEY BALL TYPE STATS HE TOLD ME THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO GROUP CRENCH THE NUMBERS FOR A LOT OF OFFICERS AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT WHETHER THEY WERE USING FORCE AND SITUATIONS THAT WOULDN'T USUALLY CALL FOR IT YYOU LEARN TWO THINGS YOU LEARN THAT MOST POLICE ARE GREAT AT THE ESCOLATION AND YOU LEARN THAT SOME POLICE ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO USE IS MUCH FORCE AS THEY LAWFULLY CAN OR THE POLICY NAPLES FROM TORIT OR THE TOP END OF THAT FACTORAE THOSE OFFICERS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A MAJOR AVERS THAT OCCUR RIGHT SOMETHING TERRIBLE THE NATURE O WHIT YOU CAN TURN ON AND SEE ON TE BE HERE AND THERE RIGHT TO MA ANOTHER ONE WHAT OS TO THE TRACK SO ANOTHER THING THA THESE FOLKS ARE LOOKING AT IS SOMETHING CALLED DISCRATIONARY ARREST UM SO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY AN OFFICER GOES INTO A SITUATION THE DESN NECESSARILY REQUIRIN ARREST AND MAKES ONE YES THEY PULLING OVER THE MAFFICES FOR GOING THIRTY FIVE AND A TWENTY FIVE THAT RESULTS IN A AN ARREST OR OAG LIKE AS JUS TE TRAFFICS UP AS A SPEEDING TIC ECHAN NESOA RESULT AND ARREST YET EXACTLY YE SAME WITH DUKE STALLING RIGHT LIKE IT THE NOISE COMPLAINT AND HE ANDS UP ARRESTING DUKE AND HIS UNCLE A CASE SO SO ALL THAT GOES UNTI I ANOGARATHEM OR WHATEVER YET EXACTLY UM AND ONE THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE FINDING IS THAT PATTERNS OF PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR WITH POLICE OFFICERS TYPICALLY GO TOGETHER SO IF AN OFFICER HAS ONE KIND OF BAD BEHAVIOR THAN THE PROBABLY CAN HAVE OTHERS SO THE OFFICER WHO PUSHES DOWN AN OLD LADY IS MORE LIKELY TO BE AN OFFICER WHOS INVOLVED IN SAY THREE SHOOTINGS U AND THERE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE THE OFFICER WHO IS NOW AT A TRAFFIC STOP TELLING A COUPLE TO SHUT UP WE DON'T GENERALLY FINE THAT OH AN OFFICER IS JUST THROUD OR AN OFFICER JUST USES A LITTLE TOO MUCH FORCE AND YOU KNOW IF WE USE THE STORY THAT YOU SHARED THIS OFFICER WASN'T JUST RUD RIGHT THAT IS THE GENERAL ACCURATE STORY WE DON'T REALLY JUST FIND WELL THIS OFFICER IS OTHERWISE GREAT BUT IS JUST ACROSS DISRESPECTAL RIGHT BUT THE DATA WOULD GENERALLY SHOW THAT OFFICERS GOING TO BE STRUGGLING INO OTHER PARTS OF THEIR JOB THEY'RE USING MORE FORCE THAN ONE WOULD EXPECT THEY'RE USING A HIGHER PROPORTIONALITY OF FORCE I JUST WANT TO ADD YOU KNOW ANOTHER THING THAT THEIR TRACKING IS WHO POLICE OFFICERS ARE DOING PROBLEMATIC THINGS TO SO IF AN OFFICER USES MORE FORCE WITH PEOPLE OF COLLER SAY TAK THAT'S CAN A SHOW UP SO DOES THIS MONE ABOUT SYSTEM WORK BETTER LIKE WHAT WE KNOW LIKE DO THEY ACTUALLY CATCH MORE PROBLEM OFFICERS AND GET THE TO CHANGE OR N A GET RID FEM I MEAN WHAT ROUN HUMORMAN SAYS S THEY'VE ONLY BEEN DOING THIS FOR FEW YEARS SO IT'S STILL PRETTY EARLY TO TELL HOW IT'S WORKING UM BUT HE SAYS SOME DEPARTMENTS GET BETTER RESULTS THAN OTHERS AND THE KEY VARIABLE IS HOW THEY FOLLOW THROUGH LIKE WHEN AN OFFICER GETS FLAGD AR  LOT OF DEPARTMENTS EXOR USING NEW MADIBO VHERSIONS OF THE STOTS NO NOT THAT MANY UM RON HUBORMAN'S COMPANY WHICH IS BASED ON ALL THIS UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO RESEARCH IS CALLED BENCH MARK ANALYTICS AND THAT ONE IS WORKING WITHABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POLICING AGENCIES AWHICH I KNOW SOUNDS LIKE KIND OF ALOTAT FRM BUT YE THERE'S LIKE EIGHTEEN THOUS AND POLICING AGENCIES OLLIVER THE COUNTRY MOST OF AMERICA IS MISKAGEN RIGHT THAT THAT IS THE AVERAGE OR THE NORMAL POLICE FARMIN IN AMERICA WHICH IS THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN PLACE BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS NOT IT DOES NOT HAVE BOTH THE DATA IN THE CITISTICATION TO IDENTIFY OPLOMATIC PATTERNS YOU JOST SO I ASKED RON HUMURM LIKE WHAT OF THE BIG OBSTACLES FOR GETTING THESE SYSTEMS UP IN RUNNING AND HE SAID SOME OF HIM OUR SUPERSTRAIGHTFORWARD YOU KNOWS A MONEY IN TACK AN GETTING AT IN PLACE A BUT THE BIG PROBLEM HE SAID IS IS POLITICS A POLICE UNIONS THEY JUST TIPICALLY FIGHT ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES SCRUTINIZING AND DISCIPLINING OFFICERS SO YOU AN'T TO GET THESE SYSTEMS IN THAT'S WHERE THE RESISTANCES CANTO BE WEL BEN THNK U VERY MUCH THANK YOU     A WHATS TNE IS BON O THE

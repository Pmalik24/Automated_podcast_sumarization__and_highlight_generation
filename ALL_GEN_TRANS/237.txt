ALONG WITH OUR AGREEMENT OTHER HE BLY TALK TO WHO WENTHROW AWAY TUT MOMEN THEY ALSO GOT TO THIS POINT THECAME TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR AND ALL KINDS OF WAYS TO AVOID THE WORST CASE ANAREAS AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT KNOWING INDIVIDUAL ACTION WON'T BE ENOUGH ONE FAMILY DRIVING AN ELECTRIC CAR AR GIVING UP PLASTIC STRAWS ISN'T GOING TO DO THE JOB ANY SERIOUS CLIMATE SLUTION WILL REQUIRE AN OVERHAUL OF OUR ENERGY SOURCES AT A GLOBAL LEVEL BUT IT'LL ALSO REQUIRE AS TO LIVE DIFFERENTLY WITHOUT THAT THE SITUATION WON'T CHANGE AND NOTS FOR THINGS GET MESSY DECIDING WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE IN YOUR OWN FAMILY THE KIDS REALLY WANTED TO GET A CAT ANDOS LIKE WELL I GROPE WITH PETS I THINK THER'D BE GREAT AND HE SAID NO WE CAN'T DO THAT I'M TRYING T UNDERSTAND WHY HE SAYS THAT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF A DOMESTICATED HOUSE PET AR RIDICULOUS THAT IS ALL THE PROCESS MEAT THE PATSY AND THE CANS AND PLASTIC THE FOOD COMES IN PLUS CATLETTER DOG TOYS CRIPS TO THE BAT WE'RE NOT IN SUPPORT THAT THERE ETHER CANNOT BE PETS IN THIS HOUSE THE FAMILY ENDED UP SETTLING ON GETTING CHICKENS WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD COMPROMISE BECAUSE THE IDS LOVED THE CHICKENS AND MIKE WAS HAPPY THE CHICKENS PRODUCED EGGS BECAUSE I MEN THEY WOULND BE SUPPORTING FACTORY FARMS THAT PRODUCE SUPERMARCET EGGS BUT FLYING ON PLANS BECAME A REAL POINT OF CONTENTION IN THE FAMILY MILINDA WANTED TO TAKE THE KIDS TO DISMY WORLD FOR VACATION YUS LIKE WERE NOT GOING WERE NOT HE SAIGNA WERD NEVER GETTING ON A PLAINE AGAIN I WERE NOT I MISS THAT MIMMEL WHAT WHAT AND I MADE THE MISTAKE OF SAYING BUT I FLY FOR WORK AND HE US LIKE EXACTLY AND MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T FLY THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE TO MIKE FLYING FELT LIKE AN EXISSENTIAL THREAT TO HIS KIDS FUTURES AND TAVERY ONES IT WAS UNBEARABLE FOR ME TO CONTINUED DOING THE THINGS THAT WERE GOIN TO MAKES THEIR LIFE IMPOSSIBLE ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AT THE TIME DID YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE LIFESTILE CHANGES YOU WERE MAKING BECAUSE YOURE SORT OF HAVING TO BALANCE REALLY BELIEVING IN THE CAUSE AND ALSO AXCEPTING THAT YOU'RE DABED WITH TWO KIDS IND YOU KNOW MAYBE ONE PET DOUSN'T ACTUALLY MAKE THAT BICG OF IT TIF FERENCE IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS BUT IT DOES MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY KIDSLIVES LIKE HOW DID YOU BALANCE THAT THARE WAS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BOUNCE BECAUSE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A CAUSE BECAUSE I'M TALKING ABOUT THEIR SURVIVAL AND THE THINKS THERE GIN A SUFFER WHEN THEY GET OLDER SO ANYWAY SAYS SO I'M SORRY AM GETTING INTO THE PREACHING MOD AND WE'RE TRYING TO TALK FAMILY HERE BUT BUT TO ME IT'S THE SAME THING SO MILINDA CUT FLYING FOR WORK BUT NOBODY ELSE FLEW AND MILINDA DIDN'T LIKE ALL THESE CHANGES BUT SHE DIDN'T DISAGREE EXACTLY CLYME A CHANGE IS A NOBLE CAUSE THAT WAS WHAT I WAS TELLING MYSELF THIS IS FOR THE WORLD THIS IS FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR MY CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN WHY AM I BEING SUCH A BITCH ABOUT IT ONE OF THE BIGGEST WAYIS CLIMATE ACTIV AS'M CHANGE THIS FAMILY IS HAID A TURNED MIKE INTO A KIND OF STAGE TAT  PERFORMING WITH HIS KIDS ALL THE TIME WITH ALL THE TENTION AND FRICTION THAT COMES WITH THAT IT WAS ES PECIALLY INTENTS BECAUSE MIKE'S CLIMATE WORK WAS ALL ABOUT KIDS SO HE NEEDED HIS KINS TO BE THE FACE OF IT HES EMERIS I STARTED HAVING ISSUES IF MY DAD WHEN IT WAS LIKE HE STARTED FEELING MORE LIKE A COACH THAN A DAD AND HE WAS JUST LIKE BRINGING MORE AND MORE AND MORE THINGS IT'S LIKE I WOULD WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND HE WOULD BE LIKE WERE EVEN IN TWO HOURS THERE'S A PRESENTATION HERE'S THERE NOTS YOU HAVE TO SPEEK WRITE A SPEECH NOW EMERAS HAD LWAYS LIKE GIVING SPEECHES LIKE DRITING THEM BUT MIKE WANTED TO SEE THEIR SPEECHES AHEAD OF TIME AND PRACTISE WOULD GET ANGRY IF THEY DIDN'T LET HIM GET MAD AFTERWARDS IF HE THOUGHT THEY DIDN'T HIT THE RIGHT POINTS IN FRONT OF CROWDS MIKE WAS ALWAYS COMPLIMENTARY UP THEIR SPEECHES IT'S LIKE WHEN LIKE IF YOU WERE IN A THEATRE PRODUCTION AND LIKE THE DIRECTOR LIKE GIVES A TALK AFTER THE SHOW OR SOMETHING LIKE I WAS THE ACTOR I'D PLAYED MY LITTLE PART AND THEN HE WOULD COME OUT AND BE LIKE I'M SO PROUD LIKE EY DIDN'NT AMAZING JOB ON IN MIS MICHAEL FOSER AND I MA CROD POP ER RIT NOW A I I KNON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY AT BLO ME WAY EVERY SING TON A AND THAN ONCE THE AUDIENCE LEAVES ITS TIME FOR NOTS ONCE THEY'RE NOT LOOKING THEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID WRONG AND EVERYTHING THAT YOUHAVE TO DO BETTER NEXT TIME AN TO PUT IT POLITELY SINCE MILINDA WAS OFT WORKING SO MUCH OF THE TIME SUPPORTING THE FAMILY SHE HAD NO REALSE SENSE THAT INCREASINGLY THIS SHAID BECOME AMERAS AND MIKE'S DYNAMIC UNTILL ONE DAY THE KIDS HAD A SPEECH FAR OUTSIDE OF TOWN MILINDA DROVE THE FAMILY TO AND FROM THE SPEECH SINCE SHE HAD A HIGHBRED CAR AND MKE'S ELECTOR CAR COULDN'T MAKE AT THAT FAR AMERAS HAD GIVEN A SPEECH AND I THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT AT YOU NON THE MOMP AND WE GOT IN THE CAR AND I WAS DRIVING AND MIKE WAS IN THE SEET NEXT TO ME AN THE KIDS WERE IN THE BACK AND HE WAS YELLING BECAUSE AMERAS HADN'T LET HIM READ THE SPEECH BEFORE THEY GAVE IT AND HE WAS SAYING YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME READ THAT SPEECH BEFORE WECAUS I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU AT THE TIME I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE MISSING THESE POINCHS AND GOT DOWN IF YOU WOULD LET ME SEE THAT YOU WOULD HAE DONE A BETTER JOB YOU MISSED YOUR OPPORTUNITY YOU FLUCKED IT UP AND YOU MISSED YOUR OPPORTUNITY I'M TREVY ONE WOKE SO LET ME JUST SAY I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT WHAT DO YOU KNOW YOU EVEN LISTEN HALF THE TIME NO SIKE AKING BACK LINDA POINTS TO THIS MOMENT IS ONE OF HER FAILURES THAT SHE LETTHER KIDS GIVE SPEECHES AFTER THIS BUT AT THE TIME MIKE WAS SO CONFIDENT IN WHAT WAS RIGHT AND MILIN DIDN'T TRUST THE FEELING THAT TOLD HER OTHERWISE SO I'D LIKE WILL MAYBE THIS IS THEIR DYNAMIC MAYBE THIS IS HOW THEY COMMUNICATE THAT THEY FLARE UP AND THEY NOT THAT THE KIDS EVER YELL BUT MAYBE MIKE YELLS BUT MOVE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS AND BECAUSE THE NEXT DAY THE'RE WORKEN ON IT AGAIN AND HE'S A FAMILY FAIRFEST OR A HOL THERS ILD IN FAMILYES THEY ARE UP AS SO YOU KOW THERE'S THAT HANGING OVER MY HEAD TOO OF LIKE HE KNOWS HE'S THE EXPERT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THEIR FAMILY BREAKING APART AND ONE OF THE REASONS MIKE WAS EAGER TO SPEAK WITH ME IS BECAUSE HE FEELS PRETTY IN THE DARK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BUT SPLID HIS FAMILY UP AND LEFT HIS KIDS SO BITTER THAT AT THIS POINT THEYHAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM IN YEARS HE DOESN'T GET WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE THAT WAS SO BAD HIS FAMILY STILL WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM SAID HE FEELS THAT HE'S AN AGATHA CRISTY NOVEL HE KNOWS HE'S THE KILLER HE JUST AS KNOW I DEA

HAVE BLOW UPS THOUGH SHE ALWAYS KNEW HOW TO CALM HIM DOWN BUT MIKE AND MILINDA AND THE KIDS ALL AGREE TALBURSTS RAMPED UP CONSIDERABLY AFTER MIKE GOT INTO CLIMATE ACTIVISM LINDA SAID HE WAS NEVER PHYSICALLY VIOLENT WITH HER OR THE KIDS BUT THE FREQUENCY AND THE FOCUS OF THE BLOW UPS CHANGED I WOULD JUST GO FOR MY EROT A NINETY AND YOU WOULD NOT SEE A COMMON AND ALL A SUDDEN IT WAS LIKE YOU KNO INSIDE ME IF HOLT LIKE OKAY THE WORLD IS GON AAND BECAUSE OF THIS IT BECAUSE IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING SOMEBODY DID OR SAID OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW LIKE IF WE IF WE CAN'T IF OUR FAMILY OR YOU AND ME CAN'T

THE KIDS GET TO LIVE WITH THEIR MAM FULL TIME AS HE'D HOPED AND SHE ESTABLISH SOME SORT OF NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH MIKE THEY TRIED CUP AROUND THE FAMILY THERAPY BUT ACCORDING TO THE THARAPIST NOTS THE FIRST ROUND CRASHES AND BURNS BECAUSE MIKE KEEPS INTERRUPTING TO EXPLAIN CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE IMPORTANCE OP HIS WORK TO THE THARAPIS  AND THEY TRY AGAIN N MONTHS LATER STELLA GETS UP THE COURAGE TO TELL MIKE HER BIG SECRET FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE A CLIMATE ACTIVIST ANY MORE THA SHE WAS ONLY DOING IT BECAUSE SHE FELT HE GAVE HER NO CHOICE STELLA FIGURED HE'D SAY HE WAS SORRY AND SHE PREPARED HERSELF TO FORGIVE HIM BUT INSTEAD MIKE SEEMED ANGRY HE DID APOLOGIZE BUT THE THING HE APOLOGIZE FOR WAS THAT HE HADN'T INVITED HER TO MORE CLIMATE EVENTS SO THAT SHE'D BE MORE EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN THE CAUSE SEE THE WAY HE DID A WORD TO LISTENERS WHO MIGHT BE SENSITIVE TO THIS THIS NEXT PART OF THE STORY MENTION SELF HARM UT I JUST REMEMBER FEELING LIKE I'M NEVER GOING TO ESCAPE HIM AND WANTING EVERYTHING TO JUST BE DONE WITH BECAUS I WAS SO TIRED OF HAVING TOD EXPLAINE THESE THINGS THAT I'D GONE THROUGH AND HAVING TO THINK ABOUT HIM AND HAVING TO TALK ABOUT HIM AND TALK TO HIM AND HAVING HIM NOT BE WHO I NEEDED HIM TO BE WHEN I NEEDED IT IT JUST ALL BECAME TO MUCH ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF AFTER THE SESSION WITH HER DAD STELLA ATTEMPTED SUICIDE SHE SPENT THE NEXT EIGHT DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL SHE TOLD HER MAM TO KEEP HER DAD AWAY FROM HER SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT HIM TO KNOW SHE WAS IN THERE FOR ME IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAID NO I MEAN  IT WASN'T VERY DIGNIFIED I WAS KIND O LIKE SCEAMING AND CRYING LIKE NO DON'T WENT A MAN DON'T LET IM AN BUT A I THINK HAVING A COMPLETE BREAK FROM HIM WERE LIKE HU JUST STOPPED BEING AT ALL A CONSIDERATION FOR A WEEK BUT ALSO HAVING HAD THE POWER TO REMOVE HIM WAS REALLY CRITICAL FOR ME I TOLD MIKE WHAT STELLA SAID HOW THEIR CONVERSATION AND THARAPY WAS A BREAKING POINT FOR HER JUST BEFORE HER SUICIDE ATTEMPT HE SAID HE HAD NO IDEA HE DIDN'T REMEMBER APOLOGIZING FOR THE WRONG THING FOR SAYING HE WAS SORRY HE DIDN'T GET HER MORE INVESTED AND CLIMATE WORK I WISH I COULD REMEMBER SAYING IT AH IT SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND OF STUFF THAT WOULD HAVE COME OUT OF MY MOUTH AND I'M D WHAT A SHETTY THING WHEN SHE NEEDED SOMETHING ELSE AFTER TH AT MIKE STOPPED TRYING TO CONTACT STELLA SHEN'T WAT HIM TO AND THE THERAPA SAID IT COULD BE DANGEROUS FOR STELLA SO HE LAID LOW HOPING THE KIDS BROQUET AND WAITING FOR AN INVITE TO RETURN TO THE FAMILY STELLA SAYS THAT WITH THE BURDEN OF FIXING HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER DAD LIFTED SHE STARTED DOING A LOT BETTER FREED FROM CLIMAT WORK SHE HAD TIME TO DO THINGS THAT SHE ACTALLY LIKED LIKE GREETING FANNACY NOVELS SHE ALSO GOT A GREAT THARAPIST AND STARTED TAKING ANNY TO PRESENCE WHICH SHE SAID OF REALLY HELPED AND SO WAS STELA FEELING STURDYEAR SEEMED LIKE MIKE AND THE KIDS MIGHT POSSIBLY FIND AWAY TO REBUILD HAV A RELATIONSHIP OF SOME KIND HOWEVER FRACTURE UNTIL THIS NEXT THING HAPPENED WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT THE END OF THEIR WORLD AS THEY KNEW IT IT WAS A FALL OF TWENTY SIXTEEN A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AFTER STELLAS SUISIDE ATTEMPT ANSHE REACHED OUT TO ASK FOR A MEETING WITH HER DAD AND EMERIS AND THE THERAPES IN THE MEETING STELLA AND EMERIS TOLD THEIR DAB THAT FOR THEM TO CONSIDER HAVING A RELATIONSHIP AGAIN THEY NEEDED HIM TO STOP TOING CLIMATE WORK FOR A WHILE HR STELLA HE SAID HE WOULD AND THAT IT MADN'T WE REALLY HAPPY IT FELT LIKE CHAN EMERAS WAS STRUCK TO MAYBE IF HE COULD GET RID OF THAT THAN HE REALLY DOES CARE ABOUT US IK HE MUST REALLY LOVE US IF HE'S WILLING TO GIVE THAT UP A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT AFTER MIKE TOLD US KIDS HE WOULD STOP DOING CLIMATE ACTIVISM HE DID HIS MOST EXTREN CLIMATE ACTION EVER PROTESTERS MAN NUALLY TURNED OUR FIVE OIL PIPE WIDES TO DAY ONE OF THE FIVE PROTESTERS CAN BE SEENG HER TURNING OFF THE PIPE LI TALL THE NORTH TO CORDU THE GRUST MI TRAVEL TO NORTH VECODA WEBROKE PASS THE FENCE AROUND THE KEYSTONE PYPE LINE AND TURNED A VAVE SHUTTING OFF THE FLOW OF OIL HE WAS ARRESTED ON SIGHT AND AT THAT POINT CHARGE WITH SIX FELLONIES AND TWO MISDEMEANORS WHICH COMBINE COULD LAND UP IN PRISON FOR MORE THAN NINETY YEARS I WAS MAD I WAS SO MAD HERE'S EMERS AGAIN MAN I WAS PISSED I I MEAN IT THAT WAS THA POINT WHERE YOU KNOW HE'D SINK HE WOULD STOP DEOING ALL THIS FOR US IT'S LIKE ALL HE'S GOING TO PRISON HERES STELLA THAT MOMENT REALLY JUST WAS IT FOR ME I JUST DIDN'T CARE ANY MORE IT FELT LIKE RELIEF BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SMALL VOICE IN MY HEAD SAYING BUT HE'S YOUR DAAD YOU'VE GOT A LOVE HIM I WAS COMPLETE AND WHOLE AND DIDN'T NEED HIM AND DIDN'T WANT HIM A BUNCH OF THE CHARGES WERE AITHER DISMISSED OR AMENDED BUT MIKE ENDED UP SPENDING SIX MONTHS IN PRISON HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T REALIZE HIS KIDS WERE ASKING HIM TO STOP CLIMATE ACTIVISM RIGHT THEN HE THOUGHT THEY MEANT SOME DAT HE SAID HE HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS THE LAST STRAW FOR THEM THE VALO TURNING PROPELLED MIKE TO FAME IN A NEW WAY ESPECIALLY IN THEIR LITTLE GREEN SEATLE COMMUNITY LENDA SAYS THAN THE STORY WAS HE IS A HERO LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE HE IS A HERO HE IS A HERO AND THERE WAS A ARTICLE THE LOCAL SATLE MAGASINE WHICH PAINTED HIM AS THIS MARTER AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE SACRIFICE HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS CHILDREN FORD THE PLAMNET AND THEY THEY TRID TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW OW WE DIDN'T COULDN'T FLYANY MORE IN THE MARRIAGE BROOK APART AND AND HE HAD QUOT SANG SOMETHING LIKE YOU NOBATIONLY I JUST ANNOYED THE FLUCK OUT OF THEM TI THAT IS SO IT IS SUCH A SIMPLE VIEWPOINT HE DIDN'T ANNOY THE FLUCK OUT OF US YOU WERE AS ANNOYING HIS FOCK BUT YOU ACTUALLY WOUNDED US YOU HARMED US YOU HURT US AFTER THE SIATAL MAGAZINE ARTICLE CAME OUT CLIMATE PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO MILINDA AND THE KIDS AND TELL THEM THEY SHOULD REALLY TALK TO MIKE AGAIN THEY SHOULD FORGIVE HIM TBECAUSE HE'S DOING SUCH IMPORTANT WORK BUT EMERS DOESN'T SEE HIS WORK THAT WAY I THINK IT'S MADE IT SO THAT HIS NAME MEANS SOMETHING BUT TO VERY FEW PEOPLE IT'S A SUBSET OF FEOPLE WHO ERE ALREADY INCLINED TO THAT STUFF BUT HE HASN'T ACHIEVED ANYTHING I MEAN WITH HE'S CLIMATE STUFF LIKE I SAID THAT THAV TURNING HAD NO EFFECT THE OIL GOT THERE A COUPLE HOURS LATER AHUM HE'S MADE A SERIES OF EMPTY GESTURES AND SPENT YEARS POSTURING AS A HERO AND A FAMILY MAN AND HAS JEST DESTROYED EVERYTHING I THINK THAT WAS ACTUALLY MEANING FUL ABOUT HIS LIFE I THINK ON SOME LEVEL HE KNOWS THAT AND THATS PART OF WHY HE'S SO DESTRESSED ABOUT HAVING LOST HIS FAMILY I DON'T KNOW I GUESS I WISH HIM WELL BUT HE CAN FINED MEANING THAT HE ISN'T FAMILY AT THIS POINT THEY HAS WERE WE'RE DONE WITH HIM IT'S BEEN NEARLY SIX YEARS SINCE MIKE AND MILINDA GOT DIVORCE THERE'S BEEN ESSENTIALLY NO CONTACT BETWEEN MIKE AND THE KIDS SINCE THE VALVE TURNING THE FIRST TIME I TALKED TO MIE OUR INTERVIEW LASTED NINE HOURS MOSTLY BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY QUESTION I ASKED ABOUT HIS FAMILY HE ENDED AT VEERING INTO CLIMATE CHANGE HOW BAD THINGS WERE HALL KNOWN WAS DOING ENOUGH HOW SO MANY AND DEMIC SPECIES FACE EXTINCTION THIS CENTURY THE FACT HE TOLD ME FOUR TIMES IN OUR INTERVIEW HE OSCILLATED BETWEEN EXTREME SADNESS OVER HIS NON EXISTENT RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS KIDS TO ANGER ABOUT THE STATE OF THE WORLD THO AGITATED CONCERN THAT I HADN'T ASKED HIM ANY OF THE RIGHT QUESTIONS YET HECAUSE I HADN'T ASKED HIM ABOUT THE SCIENCE BUT WHAT IT WAS GON O TAKE TO CHANGE THINGS THE MORNING AFTER OUR INTERVIEW I WOKE UP TO AN EMAL FROM MIKE ANE ASKED FOR A DO OVERE HE SAID HE'D ACCIDENTALLY GONE INTO CLIMATE RANTOMOD INSTEAD OF SPEAKING AS A DAD HE SAID QUOTE I CAN'T LIVE WITH WHAT I SAID I CAN'T I RAMBLING SOUND MONSTROUS IDIOTIC WE TRIED AGAIN HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIS FAMILY THAT THE PROBLEM WAS HIS PERSONALITY AND THE WAY HE HANDLED HIS ACTIVISM HE TOUGHT THERE WERE THINGS HE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER BUT THE REAL PROBLEM WAS THAT HE AND MILINDA WEREN'T ON THE SAME PAGE I TOLD THEM I DIDN'T THINK HAVING TWO PARENTS LIKE HIM WOULD HAVE SOLVED THINGS WITH THE KIDS HE DIDN'T SEE IT AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HIS FAMILY COULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT UP HOW THEY WERE FEELING WITH HIM I I'D STILL NEWS TO ME THET THERE AFRAID TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS STUFF I I UNDERSTAND WE'VE YOU'VE COND HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE THESE MOMENTS WHEN I GOT ANGRY AND I WAS REALLY REALLY SCARRI TO THEM AND A BIG PERSON IN WITTLE KIDS TODALLY GET THAT AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AND YET THE APOLOGIES THE TALKS THE HUGS THE BED TIMES THERE WHATEVER THE LIVING LIFE THAT HAPPENED IN BETWEEN THESE WHATEVER MONTHS OF NOT BEING ANGRY I GUESS I WAS I WAS UNDER THE ILLUSION THIT THEY COULD TALK TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING TIT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DIDN'T AT THE TIME REALIZE HOW YOUR BEHAVIOUR WAS IMPACTING THEM BUT THERE ARE LIKE A FEW INNER ACTIONS THAT SEEM LIKE EVEN AT THE TIME YOU WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPACT LIKE EMERAS MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD CALLED STELLA A FUCKING BITCH AND A CUN WHEN SHE WAS REALLY LITTLE LIKE TEN YE WHICH THAT FEELS LIKE THAT WEU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WAS HORRIBLE THAT WAS A NIGHTMARE I COAND SEE HOWD BE HARD AFTER THAT AFTER DEAD CALLS YOU A CUNT SHE NEVER SAY ANYTHING YOT HIM TO MAKE HIM ANGRY AGAIN YES ABSRULY ABSULLY AND I DID ANYTHING IN EVERYTHING I COULD AFTERWARDS TO MAKE YOUR RIGHT BUT COME ON YOU'RE RIGHT IT THAT WAS A THING THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE BACK YE SO I LIVE WITH THAT I'M BROKEN I DON'T KNOW WH 'M HERE THE THING I OF THE MOST IS THE THING I'M FARTHISH FROM THINGS FOR MILINDA AND THE KIDS O PRETTY GOOD THESE DAYS SELLA JUST TURNED EIGHTEEN SHE SAIS THERE CLIMATE NIGHTMARES ONLY COME EVERY COUPLE WEEKS INSTEAD OF NIGHTLY AND SHE'S OFF A COLLEGE JUST FALL A MILESTONE THAT FOR A WHILE SHE NEVER THOUGHT SHE'D REACH EMRIS IS NINETEEN THEY WORK ON ABOUT TEACHING KIDS ABOUT MARINE LIFE AND MARITIME SKILLS HE JOB THEY LAVE THOUGH THEY SKIP OUT ON TEACHING THE LESSONS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THEY SAID THEY'RE NOT READY TO DO THAT YET WHILE I WAS OUT IN SIATAL DOING MY INTERVIEWS THE SUMMER THE PASIFIC NORTH WEST AS IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST EXTREME HEAT WAVE AND THE REGIONS RECORDED HISTORY CABELINES MELTED RODS CRACKED IN THE HEAT OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE DAT STELLA TOLD ME THAT DURING THE HEAT WAVE SHE HAD TO SIT IN HER ROOM AND REPEAT TO HERSELF THINGS ARE BAD AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT UNTIL THE FEELING PASSE EMERA SAYS IN LOW MOMENTS THERE DAD'S VOICE POPS INTO THEIR HEAD AND TELLS THEM THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WITH THEIR LIFE THAT ALL THEY DO AS TURN OXYGEN INTO CARMEN MELINDA AND I DID OUR INTERVIEW IN HER OFFICE THE ONLY PLACE WE COULD FIND CENTURAL I SEE EREWAS A HUNDRED SIX DEGREES OUTSIDE

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONCA S CU SCIENCE SCIENCE TACE TO UTES FOR I MAND YOUR HUBERMAN AND O'M A PROFESSOR OF NEROBIOLOGY AND OTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TODAY WE ARE DISCUSSING FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND TOOLS FOR IMPROVING YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THIS IS A TOPIC THAT IHAVE COVERED PREVIOUSLY ON THE HUBERMAN LADPODCAST BUT IN DIFFERENT CONTECTS FOR INSTANCE WE HAD A VERY POPULAR EPISODE ON EIGHTY EIGHTE ATTENTION DEFIS AT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER WHICH OF COURSE RELATES TO THE TOPIC OF FOCUS AND HOW TO IMPROVE FOCUS IT LSO TALKED A LOT ABOUT DOPOMINE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE IN FACT THATS THE TITLE OF YOUR PREVIOUS ALSO QUITE POPULAR EPISODE TO THIS PODCAST BUT NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE HAD A SINGLE EPISODE SOLLY DEVOTED TO THE TOOLS TO IMPROVE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THE RATION NOW FOR RECORDING THIS EPISODE IS TO PROVIDE PEOPLE ONE LOCATION WHERE THEY CAN GO AND QUICKLY ACCESS THE SPECIFIC TOOLS FOR INCREASIN FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL TOOLS AND THE MOST UP TO DATE TOOLS IN FACT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO INCLUDE DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL PURER VIEWED STUDIES AND THE TOOLS THAT EMERGE FROM THOSE SCIENTIFIC PUREVIEWED STUDIES THAT POINT TO NEW AND FORTUNATELY EVEN BRIEFER PROTOCALS THAN IHAVE DESCRIBED BEFORE SO AT A BASICALLY DESCRIBING HERE IS TOOLS THAT IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WILL ALLOW YOU TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION ABILITIES THOSE TOOLS WILL INCLUDE BEHAVIAL TOOLS NUTRICIAN BASE TOOLS SUPPLEMENT BASE TOOLS BRAIN MACHINE IN ERFASE BASE TOOLS AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE WORKING WITH PHYSICIAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG TOOLS TO DAY'S EPISODE OUGHT TO BENEFIT ANYBODY YOUNG OR OLD OR ANYTHING IN BETWEEN WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE EIGHTY EIGHSTY OR NOT TODAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO GIVE YOUW TOOLS HAT YOU CAN APPLY IN YOUR DAILY LIFE MOST ALL OF THEM ARE COMPLETELY ZERO COST AND THOSE TOOLS WILL ALLOW YOU TO TAP IN TO THE NORCHEMISTRY AND THE NORL CIRCUTS WITHIN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT PURE REVIEWED SCIENCE HAS RELIABLY SHOWN CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INPRUT YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION ABILITIES JUST OUGUV YOUWILL TEASER OF THE KINDS OF TOOLS THAT I AM GOING TO PROVIDE YOU ON TO DAY'S EPISODE A PREVIOUS GUESTED ON THE HUBERMAN LADPODCASTS WAS DOCTOR WENDY SEZUKI DOCTOR ZEZUKI IS A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NEROW SCIENCE AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY OR AND WHY YOU AS ITS COMMONLY REFERRED TO SHIS ALSO THE DEAN OF ARTS AND SCIENCES AT AND WHY YOU HOR LABORATORY MADE A VERY IMPORTANT DISCOVERY WHICH WAS THAT A VERY BRIEF JUST TWELVE ACTUALLY THIRTEEN IF YOU REALLY COUNT THE THE INTRO BUT THIRTEEN MINUTE DAILY MEDITATION PERFORMED FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED PEOPLES FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION ABILITIES AND THE GREAT NEWS IS YOU DIDN'T NEED ALL EIGHT WEEKS IT WAS JUST THAT'S HOW LONG THE RAI IN THE STUDY SO DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE I WILL DESCRIBE THAT PROTOCALL IN DETAIL I'LL ALSO PROVIDE YOU AND EVEN BRIEFER ALTERNATIVE TO THAT PROTOCALL THAT YOU CAN USE IF FOR INSTANCE YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH ONLY THREE MINUTES ARE FORE MINUTES ARE FIVE MINUTES A DAY TO MEDITATE THE GREAT NEWS IS THERE'S QUALITY PUREREVIEWED SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THAT FORM OF MEDITATION FOR IMPROVING FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND THAT FALLS UNDER THE BEN OF THESE ZERO COST TOOLS THAT YOU CAN REALLY USE TO TAPEN TO THE NAROW CHEMISTRY AND NARL CIRCUITS THAT REALLY ALLOW YOU TO TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR COGNIVABILITIES AND IM PROVE THEM OVER TIME ILL ALSO PROVIDE YOU IMPORTANT DETAILS ABOUT THAT PROTOCAL ANOTHER PROTOCALS FOR INSTANTS CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF IT IS NOT I REPEAT IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO DO A FOCUSED BASED MEDITATION WITHIN THE FOUR HOURS BEFORE BEDTIME MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING SOME OF THE SUBJECTS IN THAT STUDY PERFORMED BY THE SAZUKI LAB FOUND THAT WHEN THEY DID A FOCUSING MEDITATION PROTOCAL EVEN IF IT WAS VERY CALMING IT LED TO DIFFICULTIES IN FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP SO THAT RUNS COUNTER TO A LOT OF WHAT WEE HEARD ABOUT MEDITATION BEING GREAT FOR SLEEP IT TURNS OUT MEDITATION MIGHT BE GREAT FOR SLEEP AT CERTAINLY AS GREAT FOR IMPROVING FOCUS CAPACITY BUT I HALLY RECOMMEN THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO APPLY A FOCUS MEDITATION TOOL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THAT YOU MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S PERFORMED NOT WITHIN FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO BEDTIME SO THAT'S JUST A BRIEF EXAMPLE OF THE SORTS OF TOOLS AND PROTOCALS AND DETAILS ABOUT THE TOOLS AND PROTOCALS THAT I'LL PROVIDE ON TO DAY'S EPISODE I SHOULD MENTION THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED LINKS IN THE SHOW NOTE CAPTIONS SO THAT YOU CAN QUICKLY GO TO THE STUDIES THAT WE DESCRIBE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS AND OTHER TOOLS THAT WILL COVER THINGS LIKE THE USE OF BYNORL BEAT SUPPLEMENTS ET CETERA OUR GOAL HERE AGAIN IS TO PROVIDE YOU THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TOOLS FOR FOCUS IND CONCENTRATION THAT YOU CAN PICK FROM AND CHOOSE FROM AN APPLY IN YOUR LIFE AND TRYING A LIMINATE AS MUCH OF THE LEG WORK REQUIRED TO SEEK OUT AND APPLY THOSE TOOLS BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE T EMPHASIZED THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZEROCOS TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIGNS RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSERS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NAURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANTS ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACKTELECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDR MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRSTING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KCON OPHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEADING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN OKE LET'S TALK ABOUT FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION USING SCIENCE BASED PROTOCALS NOW BECAUSE TO DA ISE EPISODE IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON TOOLS AND NOT SO MUCH THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS I MAINLY GOING TO FOCUS ON WHAT TO DO IN WHEN AND HOW TO DO IT BUT I JUST WANT TO TAKE ABOUT THREE MINUTES AND BRIEFLY DESCRIBE A MODEL THAT IS A VISUAL IMAGE THAT YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR MINE THAT WILL HELP YOU INCORPORATE THE TOOLS THAT ALL PROVIDE AND THAT GENERALLY WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND AT A MECHANISTIC LEVEL HOW FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION WORK SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE IS AN ARROW AND AN ARROW OF COURSE HAS AN ARROW HEAD AND HAS THE SHAFT OF THAT ARO AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEUROW SCIENCE OF FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THE NEURO CHEMICAL SYSTEM THAT REALLY REPRESENTS THE SHAFT OF THAT ARROW RIGHT THE STRAIGHT LINE IS EPINEPRON ALSO ALLED A DRENOLINE AND TO DAY I'LL REFER TO A DRENALINE AND EPIN EFERAN INTERCHANGEABLY TURNS OUT THAT EPINEFRAN SLASH O DRENALINE ARE RELEASED WITHIN YOUR BRAIN FROM A LLOCATIONAL CLUSTER OF NURONS CALLED LOCUS SERULIUS BUT YOU DO NOT NEED TO REMEMBER THAT NAME END FROM YOUR BODY FROM THE A DRENAL GLANCE AND THE RELEASE OF EPINEFRON FROM THOSE TWO LOCATIONS OVERALL INCREASES ENERGY IT INCREASES ALERTNESS IT DOES NOT ALONE INCREASE FOCUS CA SO THE REASON I'VE ASSIGNED EPINEFRON ADRENALINE AS THE SHAFT OF THE ARROW IS THAT IF FOCUS IS THE ARROW THERE IS NO FOCUS WITHOUT EPINEFRON SO THINGS WHETHER NOT THEIR BEHAVIORAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL OR SUPPLEMENTS OR DRUGS THAT INCREASE EPINEFRON ALLOW FOCUS TO OCCUR THEY ARE NECESSARY FOR FOCUS BUT THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR FOCUS THAT IS TEY ARE REQUIRED BUT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH TO CREATE FOCUS SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED EPINEFRON IN THE EQUATION WITHOUT EPINEFRON THERE IS NO FOCUS OR CONCENTRATION NOW THE AERO HEAD ON THIS METAPHORICAL ARROW HEAD THAT REPRESENTS FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION IS GOING TO BE REPRESENTED OR RELATED TO THE MECHANISMS OF A SEETAL COLING A DIFFERENT NEUROCHEMICAL THAT ALSO EXISTS IN THE BRAIN ANBODY IN FACTING THE BODY ITS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTRACTION AND MOVEMENT OF YOUR MUSCLES BUT TODAY WERE TALKNG ABOUT A SEATAL CALLING NOT IN THAT CONTEXT BUT RATHER IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS RELEASED WITHIN THE BRAIN A SETOCOLING IS RELEASED FROM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN AND THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS ITS LIKE A SPOTLIGHT IT HIHLIGHT SPECIFIC NURON'S NERVE CELLS THAT SHOULD BE ACTIVE OR MORE ACTIVE I SHOULD SAY THAN THE OTHER NERONS IN THE ENVIRONMENT SO THE REASON I'VE ASSIGNED THE AROHEAD TO A SEATOCOLING AND A SEETOCOLLING TO THE ARROWHEAD IS THAT IF YOU HAVE AN ARROW WITH A VERY BIG ARRW HEAD THAT'S REALLY BROAD REALLY BLOON IMAGINE A MILE WIDE ARROWHEAD THAT'S NOT VERY FOCUSED ON ANY ONE LOCATIONS NOT REALLY POINTING TO ANY ONE LOCATION IS IT BUT WITH A NARROW REALLY TIGHTLY FOCUSED ARROW HEAD WELL THAT'S FOCUSD ON ONE LOCATION SO WE HAVE ALERTNESS EPINEFRON AND THEN WE HAVE THE ACTUAL DIRECTION IN WHICH ARE CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS IS PLACED AND THAT'S IN LEAST IN THIS MENTAL MODELUM CREATI G A SETOL COLING AND THEN IN ORDER TO HAVE ON GOING FOCUS WE NEED ANOTHER NARROW CHEMICAL AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT THIRD NOCHEMICAL IS DOPOMINE A MOLECULE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH PLEASURE AND REWARD BUT IT'S REALLY THE MOLECULE OF MOTIVATION SO HERE I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE IN YOUR MIND AND ARROW WITH AN ARROW HEAD THINK OF SETO COLING IN THE ARROW HEAD A SHAFT OR A LINE BEHIND THAT ARROWHEAD WHICH IS EPINEPRAN ALSO CALL THE DRENLINE AND THEN BEHIND IT A SORT OF AN ENGINE THAT KEEPS THAT FOCUS MOVING FORWARD RIGHT BECAUSE WE DON'T JUST ONE O BE FOCUS FOR A MOMENT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS FOR TEN MINUTES OR FOR AN HOUR MAY EVEN FOR TWO HOURS TURNS OT THERE'S AN OPTIMAL DURATION TO FOCUS I'LL TEACH YOU THAT N JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT THESE THREE NARROW CHEMICALS TOGETHER A SETOCOLING EPINEPRON AND DOPAMIN REALLY ALLOW YOU TO GET FOCUS TO FOCUS VERY PRECISELY AND IN FACT INCREASINGLY PRECISELY OVER TIME TO REALLY NARROW AND NAROW AND NARRWER FOCUS PROGRESSIVELY WITHIN A SINGLE BOUT OF FOCUS AND TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT N TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT REPEATEDLY WHENEVER YOU WANT TO HERE I'M PURELY TALKING IN METAPHORE AND IN MODELS AND MENTAL MODELS OF ARROWS BUT IN A MOMENT OR TWO I'LL START TRANSITIONINTO DISCUSSING TOOLS  WHICH ILL TALK ABOUT INCREASING DOPAMIN AND A SETOL COLING OR INCREASING EPINEFRON AND DOPOMING IN VARIOUS COMMINATIONS WITH VARIOUS APPROCHUS AND WHAT I LIKE YOU TO CONCEPTIONALEYES IS HOW THOSE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO CREATING A VERY NARROWLY POINTED ARROW THAT HAS THE CAPACITY CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD OVER AND OVER SO THAT YOU CAN FOCUS AS SHARPLY AND AS LONG AS YOU LIKE AND OF COURSE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT TO GET REALLY DOWN IN THE WEEDS OF HOW DOPOMINE WORKS WE HAVE AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT DOPOMINE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE THAT REALLY GETS INTO NARROW TRANSMITTAR RELEASE AND DOPOMING BASE LINES AND THRESHOLDS AND ALL OF THAT SORT OF THING WE ALSO HAVE EPISODES ON FOCUS MUCH LONGER EPISODES I SHOULD SAY ON FOCUS THAT INCORPORATE A LOT OF THE BIOLOGY OF A SETOL COLING TURNS OUT A SETOCOLLINGS ALSO N VOLVED IN NERO PLASTICITY ET CETERA AND EPINEFERAN OF COURSE RELATES TO STRESS IN OUR CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH IN BUFFER STRESS AND ON AND ON THOSE EPISODES ARE ALL AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THEIR LONG FORM AT HUBORMAN LABDOK COM CAN FIND THE VERY EASILY THEY ARE ALL TIMESTAMPS YOU CAN NAVIGATE TO THE PARTICULAR TOPICS MOST OF INTEREST TO YOU I MENTION THIS ALL NOT AS A DIVERSION FROM WHAT WE WANT TO COVER TODAY BUT I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOUR HUNGRY FOR A LOTMORE MECHANISM BUT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS REALLY MAINLY FOCUS ON THE TOOLS I WILL OF COURSE TOUCHON MECHANISM BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THE DEEP DIBO MECHANISM GO TO HUBORMAN LABDOK COM AND YOU'LL HAVE MORE THAN YOU EVER COULD WANT ABOUT THOSE MECHANISMS LET'S JUMP INTO THE TOOLS FOR CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS IF YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT TOOLS OF ANY KIND TO MODIFY YOUR BIOLOGY OR PHYSIOLOGY IN ANY WAY WHETHER NOTS FOR COGNA FUNCTIONER YOU WANTO GET A BETTER EXERCISING OR YOU WANT O BELL MUSCLE OR OU WANT IMPROVE YOUR HORMONES YOU NEED TO THINK AND UNDERSTAND TOOLS IN THE CONTEXT OF MODULATION AND MEDIATION WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL IT'S QUITE SIMPLE REALLY MEDIATION IS HOW SPECIFIC TYPES OF CHEMICALS AND CELL LS AND CIRCUITS AND ORGANS CONTROL VERY SPECIFIC THINGS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WHEREAS MODULATION IS THE ABILITY OF CHEMICALS AND CELLS AND CIRCUITS TO A JUST HOW DIFFERENT THINGS CHANGE HOW DIFFRENT THINGS WORK IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY BUT TO DO IT MORE BROADLY WHAT O I MEAN BY THIS LEME GIVE AN EXAMPLE FOR INSTANCE I'M GOING TO TELL YOU NOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN YOUR FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION IS TO OPTIMIZE YOUR SLEEPING BEHAVIOUR THAT IS TO GET AND NOUGH QUALITY SLEEP I WOULD SAY EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE NIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE NOT EVERY ONE CAN GET OPTIMAL SLEEP A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE NIGHTS OF THEIR LIFE NOBODY TRULY NOBODY ACHIEVES THAT HOWEVER SLEEP HAS BEEN SHOWN TO RELATE TO COGNAF PERFORMANCE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE HORMON OUTPUT AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS INCLUDING A MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION WHAT WE CAN RELIABLY SAY IS THAT SLEEP MODULATES JUST ABOUT EVERY PROCESS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY SO YOU HAVE TO GET GREAT SLEEP THEREIS SIMPLY NO TOOL THAT'S GOING TO ALOW YOU TO OVERCOME CRONIC SLEEP DEPROVATION AND ALLOW YOU TO REMAIN FOCUST NO PILL NO DIVICE NO SUPPLEMENT NO PROTOCAL WHATSOEVER THERE ARE TOOLS TO OVERCOME ONE NIGHT OR MAY BE TWO NIGHTS OF SLEEP DEPROVATION WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE BUT AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL WE NEED TO DO THE THINGS THAT MODULATE ARE FOCUS AN ATTENTION IN POWERFUL WAYS AND SLEEP REALLY IS THAT THING SWE'VE DONE TWO EPISODES ONE CALLED MASTER YOUR SLEEP AND THE OTHER EPISODE IS PERFECT YOUR SLEEP THE PERFECT YOUR SLEEP AS A LOBIT MORE LIKE THIS EPISODE MORE FOCUS ON PROTOCALLS MASTER SLEEP INCLUDES PROTOCALLS AND MECHANISM AGAIN YOU CAN FIND THOSETAT HUBERMAN LABDOK COM WEELS HAVE A SLEEP TOOL KIT IT DISTILLED LIST OF THINGS TO DO IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE YOUR SLEEP A HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DOWNLOAD THAT YOUN GO TO HUBERMAN LABDOC COM GO TO THE NURL NETWORK NEWSLETTER IT IS LISTED THERE IF YOU WANT YOU CAN SIGN UPT FOR THE NEWS LETTER BUT YOU DON'T HAFTER YOU CAN SIMPLY DOWNLOAD THE PEATYAPH OF THAT TOOL KIT FOR ZERO COST WHY DO I SAY SLEEP MODULATES FOCUS AN ATTENTION WELL I'LL GIVE AN ANALOGY IF RIGHT NOW SO ON PULLED A FIREALARM IN THIS BUILDING OR IF WE HAD A FIRE IN THIS BUILDING MY ATTENTION WOULD DRIFT IT WOULD NOT BE ON RECORDING THIS POTGASSITWOULD BE ON SOMETHING ELSE BUT WOULD I SAY THAT THE FIREALARM MEDIATES ATTENTION I MEAN FIREALARMS ARE NOT REALLY INVOLVED IN ATTENTION NO RATHER THEY MODULATE MY ATTENTION THE NOISE IN THE RO MODULATES MY ATTENTION THAT'S QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN A TOOL THAT I'LL PROVIDE LATER ANDI'LL JUST GIVE YOU IL HINT OF NOW N FACT'LL GIVE IT T YOU NOW WHICH IS THAT FORTY HURTS BY NARAL BEATS HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN A NUMBER OF PUREVIEWED STUDIES TO INCREASE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND IF YOU LIKE TO ACCESS FORTY HURTS BY NARL BEATS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN ACTULLY GET AT ZERO COST YOU CAN GO INTO THE APSTORE PRINCES THE APALAPSTORE  THIS IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR ENJROYD PHONE THERE'S AN APT CALLED BRAIN WAVE AND YOU CAN GO THERE YOU CAN DIL IN FORTY HURTS AND THEY'LL PLAY THESE BYNORAL BEATS IT'S BEEN SHOWN IN MULTIBLE QUALITY PEREVIEWED STUDIES THAT PLAYING A PATTERN OF SOUND WAVES TO ONE EAR TO AND THE OTHER EAR WHICH IS SLIGHTLY OFFSET IN FREQUENCY MEANING NOT QUITE THE SAME FREGENCE SOME WHORE THAT THAT COMBINATION OF FREQUENCIES PLAYE TO THE DIFFERENT EARS ACTUALLY GET INTEGRATED WITHIN DEEP BRAIDEN CENTERS AND CAN INCREASE FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION IN PART BY INCREASING LEVELS OF THE NARRO CHEMICAL DOPEMING AND A SEAD OF CLLING WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT A L BIT EARLIER IN THIS AEROW MODEL OF FOCUS SO WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT AP I DON'T HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THAT AP I SHOULD MENTION BUT IT'S AN EXCELLENT ONE IT'S ONE THAT HAVE USE FOR MANY YEARS THEREARE ALSO ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE APSAGES FOR SLEEP AND FOR OTHER THINGS BUT THE FORTY HURTS FOR ZERO H C IS THE WAY REDOUBT FORTY HRT STIMULATION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION HERE IS MY RECOMMENDATION IN THEWAY THAT I USE IT I WOULD NOT USE FORTY ERTS BY NORLBEATS EVERY TIME IM DOING ABOUT OF WORK WHAT I TEND TO DO IS USE IT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES PRIOR TO THAT WORK AND THEN TURN IT OFF AND THEN DO THE WORK AND 'LL TALK ABOUT OTHER TOOLS TO USE DURING THAT WORK WHETHER OTS READING OR MATH OR EVEN JUST EMALING OR SOMETHING WHERE I REQUIRE A BUNCH OF FOCUS FOR A WHILE HOWEVER THERE ARE TIMES IN WHICH I'M IN AN AREA OR I'M IN A STATE OF MIND WHERE I'M FEELING VERY DISTRACTABLE AND THEN I'LL KEEP THE FORTY HURTS BY NORL BEATS ON THE ENTIRE TIME I'M DOING THAT BOUT OF COGNIVE WORK I ALSO SOMETIMES USE THE FORTY HURTS BY NORBEATS PRIOR TOI WORK OUT AND PRETYUL TO WAIT WORK OUTSWHERE I REALLY ONE TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON IN CONTRACTS PECIFIC MUSCLES THIS A VERY USEFUL TOOL AGAIN SUPPORTED BY QUALITY PE REVIEWED SCIENCE ZERO COST AVAILABLE OUT THERE NOT JUST IN THE BRAINWAVE APUT IN MULTIBLE APS I THINK MANY OF YOU WILL BENEFIT FROM IT SOME OF YOU MIGHTE NOT EXPERIENCE IT IMMEDIATELY AS A TOTAL DROPPING IN TO A TUNNEL OF FOCUS IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU MIGHT WITH SAY O THE SORTS OF NARRO CHEMICALS TAT WILL TALK ABOUT LATER LIKE ALPHA G P C AND SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS THAT CHANGE NOR CHEMICALS DIRECTLY BUT NONE THE LESS FORTY HURTS BY NORLBEATS ARE A VERY POWERFUL TOOL AGAIN ZERO COST NONFHARMICALLOGIC TOOL THE TAP IN TO YOUR OWN INNOGENIS MEANING WITHIN YOU OR EXISTS WITHIN YOU PHYSIOLOGY IN ORDER TO INCREASE A SEAD OF COLLIG AND SOME OTHER NOR CHEMICALS AND THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO WORK QUITE WELL O CASE SO ASSUMING THAT YOU ARE SLEEPING WELL EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE NIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE FOR AT LEAST WORKING ON THE VARIOUS PROTOCALS ANTOOLS TO SLEEP WELL AND SUFFICIENTLY LONG EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE NIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE AND YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL TOOLS THAT ARE SOUND DBASED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOURABILITY O CONCENTRATE IN FOCUS THERE ARE QUALITY PEREVIEWED STUDIES SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT WHITE NOISE OR PINK NOISE AND BELIEVER NOT THERE IS SOMETHING CALL PINK NOISE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SPECIFIC FREQUENCIES OF SOUND THAT ARE IN THE NOISE WELL WHITE NOISE AN PINK NOISE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO NOT IMPROVE CONCENTRATION PERSAY BUT TO IMPROVE PEOPLES ABILITY TO TRANSITION INTO CONCENTRATED STATES SO I DON'TEND TO USE WHITE NOISE IN PINK NOISE WHILE I WORK B Y NO NUMBER PEOPLE THAT DO I KNOW PEOPLE THAT ALSO USE WHAT'S CALLED BROWN NOISE A THE FOCS I KNOW FROM THE ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER TIENSIDE GET REALLY INTO THESE DETAILS OF WHITE NOISE PINK NOISE BROWN NOISE YOU CAN FINE WHITE NOISE PINK NOISE OR BROWN NOISE AND LISTEN TO IT THROUGH HEADPHONES OR IN THE ROOM THERE IS INDEED SOME DATA TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT WHITE NOISE AND THO SOME EXTENT PINK NOISE AND BROWN NOISE CAN SUPPORT THE RELEASE OF PARTICULAR NORCHEMICALS BUT MORE DATA SHOWING THAT THEY CAN AMPLIFY THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS IND THE SO CAL PREFRONTAL QUARTEC THIS FRONT AREAS OR THE BUMPER BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD A THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO YOUR ABILITY TO DIRECT YOUR OWN FOCUS AND REMAIN FOCUS ON CERTAIN THINGS SO YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF EITHER USING BYNORL BEATS BE FOR BUT NOT DURING YOUR WORK THAT IS FORTY HURTS BY NOL BEATS OR FORTY HURTS BYNORBETS THROUGHOUT YOUR ATTEMPT TO FOCUS YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF NOT USING BY NORAL BEATS BUT USING WHITE NOISE PINK NOISE OR BROWN NOISE AGAIN THERE A LOT OF ZERO COSTE APS YOU CAN FIND ALSO WHITE NOISE PINK NOISE AND BROWN NOISES ON YOU TOOBE AND THESE ARE TOOLS THAT REALLY HAVE BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER INHUMANS TO A LOW PEOPLE TO FOCUS WITH MORE DEPTH AND TO DECREASE THE TRANSITION TIME INTO FOCUS THIS IS A REALLY KEY POINT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGED WITH GETTING INTO A MODE OF FOCUS NONE OF US HOWEVER SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO JUST SIT DOWN AND DROP DIRECTLY INTO A STATE OF FOCUS I THINK THAT'S COMPLETELY AND UNFAIR REQUEST OF OURSELVES MEE FOR INSTANCE YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT YOURSELF TO GO OUT ON THE TRACK OR GO OUT FOR RUN AND NOT WARM OP YOU MIGHT JOG FOR A FEW MINUTES OR EVEN WALK BEFORE YOU WOULD JOG IN THE JOG BEFORE YOU WOULD RUN RIGHT I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD DO THAT AND IF YOU'RE DOING RESISTANCE TRAINING I DOUBT THAT YOU GO OVER AND LOAD UP THE BAR F THE MACHINE WITH THE MAXIMUM MOUNT O WAIT THAT YOU CAN MOVE AND THEN JUST DROP RIGHT AND THAT YOU ALWAYS DO A WARM UP AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND MENTAL WORK FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AS REQUIRING THAT WARM UP WHAT IS THAT WARM UP WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WARM U IS THAT WARM UP IS THE RAMPING UP OR THE INCREASE OF EPINAPHRON ADRENALAN A SETOCOLINE AND DOPOMINE THE WAY THAT NOR CHEMICALS WORK AS YOU DON'T JUST GET TO FLIP SWITCHES IN OUR BRAIN BECAUSE WE DECIDE TO THAT'S A FANTASY THAT SORT OF F THE THE LIMITLESS MOVY OR O YOU KNOW MOVIES AN IDEAS THAT SUDDENLY IN AFLIPPUS WITCH ON YOUR ARM AND ALSON YOURGOINGTO BE INALASE OR FOCUS THAT IS JUST NOTP THE WAY THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS THERE'S A GRADUAL DROPPING INTO ANY STATE WHETHER NOT THAT STATE OS SLEEP RIGHT YOU GO FROM SHALL OW SLEEP TO DEEP SLEEP IN THE OUT EVENTUALLY FOCUS TOO YOU GO FROM SHALLOW FOCUS TO INCREASINGLY DEEP FOCUS THAT IS IN OUR METAPHOR OF THE ARROW IT'S VERY BROAD ITS POINTED A LOT OF THINGS AND OVERTIME AS WE DROP IN TO FOCUS THAT ARROW IS NARROWING AND NARROWING AND NARROWING IN FACT PROBABLY BETTER O THINK ABOUT IT NARROWING AND THEN SOMETIMES OSCILLATING AND GETTING WIDER AGAIN YWE MIGHT HEAR SOMETHING DOWN THE HALLWAY OR MORE TYPICALLY OUR PHONEAL BUZS OR WILL THINK OH I WONDER WHAT SO AND SO IS DOING OUR HADN'T CONTACT THEM ABOUT SOMETHING YOUR FOCUS IS DYNAMIC IT IS NOT WHAT WE CALL A STEP FUNCTIONS NLIKE YOU GO FROM UNFOCUS TO FOCUS THAN YOU DROP IN YOUR MAXIMO FOCUS BY UN NDERSTANDING THIS DYNAMIC BY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUALLY GOING IN AND OUT OF PROGRESSIVELY BUT VARYING LEVELS OF FOCUS YOU WILL GREATLY RELEASE THE PRESSURE ON YOURSELF TO FEAL FOCUSED ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU WANT TO BE THIS IS VERY KEEP PEOPLEWHO ARE VERY GOOD AT FOCUSING UNDERSTAND THIS AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN'T EXPECT THEMSELVES TO JUST IMMEDIATELY FOCUS AND THEN SNAP INTO OR OUT OF FOCUS YI SO BE PATIENT WITH YOURSELF AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT FOCUS IS AN ABILITY THAT YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS BY ENGAGING THE NERAL CIRCUITS RESPONSIBLE FOR FOCUS REPEATEDLY OVER TIME THROUGH SO CALL NERRO PLASTISITY THE ABILITY OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE AND THAT HAS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS BUT PUT VERY SIMPLY WHAT WE REPEAT GET ETCHED INT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO BECOMES EASIER OVER TIME AND THE MORE EMOTIONALLY IMPORTANT OR VITAL SOMETHING FEELS TO US THE MORE LIKELY IT IS TO TRIGER NEURAL PLASTISY WERE IN TALK A LITTLA BIT MORE ABOUT HAVG NCREASINAL CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS LATER BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN HAND IS THE KEY IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP AND I AGAIN WILL DIRECT YOU TO HUBERMALABDOT COMMON THE NOAL NETWORK NEWSLETTER TO REALLY WORK ON OPTIMIZING YOUR SLEEP WE'VE ALSO GOT TO AUDITORY SOUND BASED TOOLS FOR IMPROVING FOCUS THERE'S FORTY HERTS BY NARALBEATS USED BEFORE OR JURING BOUTS OF FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THOSE OR EVEN IF YOU DO YOU MIGHT ALTERNATE THEM WITH OR OCCASIONALLY USE WHITE NOISE PINCNOISE OR BROWNNOISE ALSO READILY AVAILABLE AT ZERO COST THE QUESTION I OFTEN GET IS HOW LONG SHOULD I TRY TO FOCUS WELL THE RESEARCH LITERATURE POINT TO THE KEY IMPORTANTE OF SO CALLED ULL TRADIAN CYCLES EUVALL PROUABLY HEARD OF CIRCADIAN CYCLES ORE CIRCADIAN BOLOGI CIRCA THE DAY  CIRCA DAN IS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS CYCLE WELL OUR BRAIN ANBODY OPERATE WITHIN THAT DAY OR WITHIN EACH AND EVERYDAY I SHOULD SAY WITH NINETY MINUTE ALTRADIAN CYCLES SO MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE ANY TIM YOU'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND TRYING FOCUS OR GOING TO TRY AND DO AF FOCUS BOUT OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR SKILL LEARNING OR MUSICAL LEARNING OR MAY BE OU REVENTJUST HAVING A CONVERSATION MAY BE YOUR A THERAPUS OR YOUR ATTENDING THERAPY OR A CLASS HOW LONG SHOULD IT BE AND THE IDEAL DURATION IS ABOUT NINETY MINUTES NOT EXACTLY NINETY MINUTES BUT WE CAN RELIABLY SAY NINETY MINUTES OR LESS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE FULL NINETY MINUTES BUT TRYING TO PUSH YOURSELF TO BE ABLE TO DROP INTO TWO HOURS OF FOCUS ARE THREE HOURS OF FOCUS WHILL POSSIBLE IS NOT REALLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE UNDERLINE BIOLOGY EVERYTHING FROM OUR SLEEP STATES OR THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEE AND OUR WAKING STATES IS DIVIDED INTO THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES ARE SO CALLED OTRADEAN CYCLES SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO A SET A TIMER FOR NINETY MINUTES I ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THE FACT THAT UNDER MOST CONDITIONS UNLESS I'M REALLY PRESSED FOR A DEAD LINE AND AM OPTIMALLY CALFINATED AT CETERA THE FIRST FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF THAT NINETY MINUTES ARE A TRANSITION TIME S LIKE THE WARM UP FOR FOCUS BUT I DO INCLUDE IT IN THAT NINETY MINUTES AND THEN I REALLY TRY IND DROP INTO DOING FOCUSED MENTAL WORK OR LEARNING OF SOME SORT AGAIN THIS COULD BE PHYSICAL AS WELL MOTOR SKIL LEARNING WERE THE AR RUNNING OR LIFTING WAIGTS ET CETERA AND REALLY TRYIND DROP INTO THAT ACROSS THE FULL NINETY MINUTES AGAIN AXCEPTING THE FACT OQUE IT'S NOT JUST AN IDEA THE FACT THAT OCCASIONALLY ARE FOCUS WILL FLICKER IT WILL JUMP OUT OF FOCUS AND THEN A BIG PART OF BEING ABLE TO FOCUS IS TO GO BACK TO FOCUSING THE WAY I LIKE YOU TO CONCEPTUALIZE THIS PERHAPS IS THAT ARROW HEAD SUDDENLY GETTING VERY VERY BROAD THAT YOUR FOCUSING ON MANY THINGS OR THAT AEROW SHIFTS TO UNDIFFERENT LOCATION IN THE ROOM THE KEY IS TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT IT BACK AND TO NARROW IT ONCE AGAIN AND THAT'S AN ACTIVE PROCESS SO MUCH SO THAT IT REQUIRES A LOT OF METABOLIC ENERGY YOUR BRAIN IS THE CHIEF CONSUMER OF METABOLIC ENERGY A THE CALLORIES THAT YOU CONSUME IS SO CALL BAZAL METABOLICGRATE MOST OF THAT ISN'T RELATED TO MOVEMENT OR HEART BEAT OR BREATHING ITS RELATED TO BRAIN FUNCTION YOUR BRAIN IS A GLUTTON WITH RESPECT TO COLORIC NEED SO UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE END OF NINETY MINUTES ORE MAY BE EN AFTER FORTY FIVE MINUTES YOU MIGHT FEEL RATHER TIRED OR EVEN EXHAUSTED AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT AFTER ABOUT O FOCUS THAT YOU TAKE AT LEAST TEN MINUTES AND IDEALLY AS LONG AS THIRTY MINUTES AND GO THROUGH WHAT I CALL DELIBERATE DEFOCUS YOU REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON SOMEWHAT MENIAL TASKS OR THINGS THAT REALLY DON'T REQUIRE A TON OF YOUR CONCENTRATION THIS IS STARTING TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT OF A MOVEMENT OUT THERE IN THE CAN APOPPSYCHOLOGY AND OPTIMIZATION WORLD THIS IDEA OF NOT LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE AS YOU WALK DOWN THE HALL TOF THE BATHROOM CERTAINLY NOT LOOKING YOUR PHONE IN THE BATHROM AND I SHOULD MENTION BY THE WAY THAT THIS IS A A PARTICULAR ANNOYANCE OF MINE HAVE YOU NOTICE THAT WEIGHT TIMES FOR REST ROOMS AND PUBLIC PLACES HAS INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE REASON FOR THAT IS NOT DIGESTIVE OQUET IT'S NOT THE GUP MICROBIUM IT MIGHT BE THE GUT MI CROBIME BUT CHANCES ARE IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ON THEIR PHONES IN THE BATHROOM SO YOU DOING YOURSELF AND EVERYBODY ELSE A FAVOR BY STAYING OFF YOUR PHONE IN THE REST RUM STAYING OFF YOUR PONE WHILE WALKING DOWN THE HALL TRY AND GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME TO DELIBERATELY DECOMPRESS TO LET YOUR MENTAL STATES IDLE TO NOT BE FOCUSED ON ANY ONE THING THAT PERIOD OF IDLING IS ESSENTIAL FOR YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT REST BETWEEN SETS OF RESISTANCE TRAINING OR REST BETWEEN EXERCISE IS VITAL TO BEING ABLE TO FOCUS AND PERFORM DURING THE ACTUAL SETS OR DURING THE ACTUAL BOUTS OF RUNNING OR CYCLING OR WHATEVER ON YOUR PARTICULAR FORM OF EXERCISE MIGHT BE SO DELIBERATE DECOMPRESSION IS KEY AND I KNOW THIS IS HARD BECAUSE WE'RE ALL BEING DRAWN IN BY THE INCREDIBLE A RICH ARRAY OF CENSORY INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON OUR PHONES IND OTHER DEVICES BUT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH ARE ABILITY TO FOCUS IS NOT JUST RELATED TO WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE ENTRY AND MOVEMENT THROUGH THOSE FOCUS BOUTS BUT AFTER THOSE FOCUS BOUTS WE REALLY NEED TO DELIBERATELY DECOMPRESS AND OF COURSE THE ULTIMATE DECOMPRESS THE TIME IN WHICH WE ARE NOT DIRECTING OUR THINKING IN OUR ACTION IS DURING SLEEP AND SO IT'S NO WONDER OR I SHOULD SAY HOLDS TOGETHER LOGICALLY THAT THAT DEEP LONG LASTING DURATION OF NOT CONTROLLING WHERE OUR MIND IS AT IS IN FACT THE ULTIMATE FORM OF RESTORATION EVEN IF WE HAVE VERY INTENSE DREAMS SO TAKE THAT PERIOD AFTER EACH NINE YOU MINUTE OR LESS FOCUS BOUT RIGHT REMEMBER THOSE FOCUS BOUTS DRON'T OUT TO BE FULL NINETY MINUTES THAT SEE YOU FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF WORK IT IS DONE WITH IT SET IT DOWN AND GO DO SOMETHING FOR MAY BE FIVE TEN MAY BEVEN THIRTY MINUTES THAT IS FUNCTIONAL FOR YOUR DAY I JUST NOT JUST WALKING ROUND IN CIRCLES OR STARING UP THE SCYLE IF YOU CAN DO THAT DO THAT HE MOST OF US HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO BUT DO THINGS THAT ARE RATHER AUTOMATIC OR REFLECTIVE FOR YOU AND TRYING NOT TO DO ANY FOCUST READING TRY NOT TO BRING YOUR VISION INTO A TIGHTLOCATION SUCH AS YOUR PHONE AND TRYING DELIBERATELY DECOMPRESS BECAUSE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DROP IN TO INTENT SBOUTS OF FOCUS AGAIN REPEATEDLY REPEATEDLY THRUGHOUT THE DAY I'M OFTEN ASKED HOW MANY UL TRADING IN CYCLES ONE CAN PERFORM THROUGHOUT THE DY THAT DEPENDS ON HOW WELL YOU SLEPT HOW WELL YOU ARE NOURISH WHICH WELL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT AND HOW WELL TRAINED UP YOUR FOCUS CAPACITY IS AND HERE'S THE PARADOX IF YOU ARE VERY TRAINED AT FOCUSING IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT DROPPING INTO FOCUS YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO NEED MORE DELIBERATE DECOMPRESSION AND DE FOCUS AND I RECOMMEND ONLY DOING ABOUT TWO MAYBE THREE DEEP WORK SESSIONS PER DAY SO NOT ONE NINETY MINUTE SESSION THAN EXPECTING YOURSELF TO DO ANOTHER ONE ANOTHER ONE ANOTHER ON BUT RATHER ONE DEEP WORK NINETY MINUTE SESSION A MAY BE ANOTHER IN THE AFTERNOON A LOT OF PEOPLE GET SURPRISED BY THIS AND SAY WAIT HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN AFFORGIJUST WORK THREE HOURS A DAY I'M NOT SEETING JUST WORK THREE HOURS A DAY I'M REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE HARD MENTAL WORK AND AGAIND SOMEWHAT PARADOXICALLY THE MORE YOU CAN CONCENTRATE THE MORE DEEPLY YOU CAN CONCENTRATE THE FEW ARE DEEP WORK CONCENTRATION BOUTS YOU CAN ACTUALLY PERFORM EACH DAY IS MAKE SENSE HOWEVER IF YOU THINK ABOUT IN THE CONTECT OF SAY RESISTANCE TRAINING IF YOU ARE STRONGER AND STRONGER IN THE GIM OR YOU'RE AN ENDURANCE ATHLEDE AND YOU CAN RON YOU KNOW ULTRA MARITHONS A HUNDRED MILES OR SO YOU ARE ESENSIALLY CUTTING A DEEPER CUT INTO YOUR RECOVERY CAPACITY THEN SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT VERY SKILLED AT THOSE THINGS OR CAN'T PERFORM AS MUCH INTENSE WORK SO THE INTENSITY OF THE WORK SCALES DIRECTLY WITH HOW LONG YOU NEED TO REST AFTER THAT WORK I AT THE STAGE OF MY LIFE AND PRETTY GOOD IT DROPPING IN TO AND MAINTAINING FOCUS BOUTS OF CONCENTRATION PROVIDED THE LANDSCAPE OF MY LIFE IS RIGHT YAUND I DON'T HAVE SOME BURNING TRESSFUL THING THAT'S A SENSIAL OR AN EMERGENCY THAT I'M TENDING TO AND THAT I PUT MY PHONEAWAY OR TURN IT OFF I CAN DO THREE NINETY MINUTE FOCUS BOUTS PER DAY BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT AND THEN IN BETWEEN THOSE FOCUS BOUTS I'M DOING OTHER THINGS THAT REQUIRE LESS FOCUS SOME OF YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PERFORM FOUR WHAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IS THAT YOU TRY DOING AT LEAST ONE THAT IS ONE NINETY MINUTE OR LESS BOUT OF FOCUSED CONCENTRATED WORK PER DAY AND YES THAT MEANS THE WEAK ENDS TO AND ON THE WEAKUNS I LIKE TO READ A BOOK WITH MY PHONE NOWHERE IN SIGHT NOT ON AN TO DEVICE THAT'S WHAT I DO OR I'LL LISTEN TO AN AUDIOBOOK SOMETIMES WHILE TAKING A WALK BUT REALLY CONCENTRATING ON WHAT I'M TRYING TO LEARN WHAT I'M HEARING AND WHAT I'M SEEING SO AGAIN A DAILY NINETY MINUTE BOUET IS ONE TO START WITH IN THO WITSAY AFTER ABOUT FOUR WEEKS OF THAT IF YOU'RE ABLE TO STAY CONCENTRATE AT WORK THROUGH THE AGITATION THEN I WOULD CONSIDER INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FOCUS BOUTS AGAIN THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD GO TO YOUR TEACHER OR YOUR OM PH T ADVISOR OR YOUR PARENT OR YOUR FRIENDS AND THEY LISTEN I I CAN'T REALLY CONCENTRATE OR THINK ABOUT ANYTHING FOR MORE THAN NINETY MINUTES PER DAY THAT'S NOT WHAT I 'M SAYING THESE ARE DEEP FOCUSRS BOUTS THESE ARE BOUTS OF WORK OR I SHOULD SAY MENTAL WORK OF PHYSICAL WORK WHERE YOU'RE REALLY FORCING YOURSELF TO FOCUS AND REFOCUS TO SHARPEN THE HEAD OF THAT ARROWHEAD TO REDIRECT ED TO WHAT YOUR TRYING TO CONCENTRATED ON AND IT IS INDEED HARD WORK I WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT IT MOR LESS LIKE A WORKOUT OF ANY KIND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEM IN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEN TAKING ATHLTIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ORE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MUN SYSTEM AND BASICALY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS ANOTHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL F MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE CRIPE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S THATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY A VITEM IND THREE K TO I MENTION THE TOPIC OF NUTRITION A LITTLE BIT AGO AND OF COURSE NUTRITION IS A COMPLICATED TOPIC IN FACT ONE OF THE QUICKEST WAYS TO GEELF INTO A BATELE ON LINE AS TO SAY SOMETHING DEFINITIVE ABOUT NUTRITION IS ONE A CLEARLY STATE MY STANCS ABOUT NUTRITION I FULLY SUPPORT AND APPLAUD THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE VIGANS FOR WHATEVER REASON THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE PURE CARNIVORE FOR WHATEVER REASON AND THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE OMNIVORS FOR WHATEVER REASON I HAPEN TO BE AN OMNIVOR MY GOAL IS ALWAYS TO EAT HIGH QUALITY MINIMALY OR NON PROCES FOODS AND TO EAT THINGS IN MODERATIONSO I DO  SA MEAT FROM SUSTAINABLE SOURCES OR FROM ORGANI SOURCES I EAT SMSTARCHES AND I EAVEGETABLES AND I ATFRUITS I TRY NOT TO EAT SUGARSAND I DON'T REALLY LIKE HIGHLY PROCESS FOODES AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE THAT'S ME THAT'S WHAT I DO BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT DICTATING WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD EAT I KNOW CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE QEITOGENIC AND I CAN SAY THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO ACHIEVE QITOSIS AND CAN GET INTO QUITOSIS YES INDEED THERE IS A MENTAL STATE ASSOCIATE WITH QUITOSIS THAT WILL ALLOW YOUR BRAIN TO FUNCTION AND TO THINK REALLY CLEARLY THAT MANY PEOPLE FIND VERY ATTRACTIVE AND KEEP THEM GOING BACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO A QITOGENIC DIET I'M SOMEBODY WHO FOR INSTANCE HAS NOBEN IN QUITOSIS MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE AT LEAST NOT DELIBERATELY SO BUT I ACTUALLY WILL INGEST LIQUILD QITONES FROM TIME TO TIME BECAUSE OF THE FURTHER COGNIVE AN HANDSMEN ORN PHYSICAL ENHANSMENT THAT I EXPERIENCE ON TOP OF NUTRITION THAT DOES INCLUDES SOME CARBOHYDRATES SO THERE A LOT DIFFRENT WAYS TO APPROACH ALL THIS WHETHER NOT YOURE AVIGAN OMNIVORE VEGETARIAN CARNIVORE ET CETERA THE POINT IS THIS YOUARE ABILITY TO FOCUS AND IN FACT YOUR ABILITY OF NURONS TO INCODE SPECIFIC INFORMATION IN YOUR VIRONMENT THAT IS TO REPRESENT WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE WORLD IS ACTULLY RELATED TO YOUR BLOOD GLUCO SLEVEL NOW HEURE UM SETTING ASIDE THE DISCUSSION OF QUITOSIS AN AND QUITOGENIC DIETS FOR THE MOMENT BUT THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL STUDY THT WAS PULSHION NURON NOT LONG AGO THAT SHOWE THAT THE TUNING THAT IS THE PRECISION WITH WHICH NURONS IN THE BRAIN OR REPRESENT THINGS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IS ACTUALLY MUCH GREATER WHEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT GLUCOS IN THE BRAIN TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH THIS MEANS THAT WHEN WE ARE FASTED OR WHEN OUR BLOOD GLUCOS IS VERY LOW WE AREN'T ABLE TO PERCEIVE AND THINK ABOUT THINGS AS CLEARLY NOW THERE'S A TWIST TO THIS HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE WHO PRACTISE INTERMIT IN FASTING AND I SHOULD SAY I PRACTISE A SORT OF PSEUDO INTERMIN FASTING IGENERALLY EAT MY MEALS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ELEVEN A M AND EIGHT P M ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THEIR SOME WIGGLE AROUND THAT OCCASIONALLY HAVE AN EARLY BREAKFAST I'M NOT SUPERRIGED ABOUT IT BUT I KNOW THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE'RE DOING LONGER FAST FOR THER EATING IN A SIX HOUR WINDOW WE DID AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT FASTING YO CAN AGAIN FIND THAT HUBERMANLAVDOT COM WILL LIKELY HAVE SUCH IN PANDA WHOSE AN EXPERTAN INTERMIN FASTING ON THE PODCAST INTERMITTEN FASTING HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S A CONVENIENT WAY TO RESTRICT THEIR CALORIES FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO CONVENIENT WAY TO AVOID EATING THAT IS ITS EASIER TO NOT EAT THAN TOEAT A SMALL PORTION OF THEY OP FOR INTERMITTENT FASTING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HERE VERY OFTEN IS THAT SOME PEOPLE LIKE BEING FASTED BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE CLARITY OF MIND THAT IT PROVIDES HERE'S THE SITUATION NURONS UNLESSYOU'RE IN AQUITOGENIC DIET REALLY THRIVE ON GLUCOS THEY LOVE GLUCOS AND AS I MENTION BEFORE YOURE ABILITY TO THINK AND PERCEIVE THINGS IS ACTUALY ENHANCED BY HAVING SUFFICIENT GLUCOS IN YOUR BLOOD STREEM SO WHY WOULD IT BE THAT SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A HEIGHTENED STATE OF MENTAL CLARITY WHEN THEY ARE FASTED I'VE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE THAT BEFORE WELL I SHOULD SAY THAT PROVIDED YOUR WELL HYDRATED ENOUGH AND YOUHAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLITES IN YOUR SYSTEM WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT WHEN YOU INGEST FOOD THEREIS A SHIFT IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TOWARDS SO CALLED PARIS SYMPATHETIC MODE THAT IS THE MORE RELAXED YOU PARLY HERD T AS REST AN DIGEST ALTHOGH IT DOES OTHER THINGS A MORE RELAXED MODE THEY CAN INDEED MAKE US VERY SLEEPY IF WE HAVE TOO MANY CRARBER HYDRATES HAT ACTHY CAN MAKE US QUITE SLEEPY HOWEVER IF WE HAVE ANY FOOD IF WE HAVE ENOUGH OF IT THAT IS IF OUR GOT IS FULL IT DIVERTS BLOOD TO OUR GOT AND WE BECOME SLEEPY AND WE CAN'T FOCUS AS WELL SO A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY LIKE FASTING IN THE STATE OF BEING FASTED FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF THAT PARIS SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION THEYRE JUST NOT AS SLEEPY AND IN FACT UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS HALF AS MUCH CAFFIN WILL GIVE YOU JUST AS MUCH LIFT AS TWICE AS MUCH CAFFIN WILL GIVE YOU ON A FULL BELLY OF POSTON THAT'S JUST THE WAY THAT CAFIN INTERACTS WITH BLOOD GLUCOS SO WHAT I LIKE YOU TO IMAGIN IS IF YOU HAD A MEASURE OF FOCUS FROM ZERO TO TEN THESE ARE ARBITRARY UNITS TEN BEING MAXIMALY FOCUS AN ZERO BEING NOT FOCUS AT ALL IMAGINE A YOU SHAPED FUNCTION RIGHT WHERE IF YOURE VERY FASTED YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE HIGH DEGREE OF FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION BUT THEN IF YOU IN JEST SOME FOOD IN YOUR BELLY IS FULL YOU'R FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION IS REDUCED BUT HAVING ENOUGH BLOOD GLUCOSE AND MAYBE EVEN ELEVATED BLOUD GLUCOS WILL INCREASE COGNAV FUNCTION SO THERE TWO ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM ON ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM BLUG LUCOS IS RELATIVELY LOW AND YOU'R FASTED AND YOU CAN THINKEN BEHAVE IN A VERY CONCENTRATED WAY AND ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM YOU HAVE A LOT OF BLOOD LUCOS RISHUS A SUFFICIENT BLOOD LUCOS YOU NEVER WANT YOUR BLOOD LUCOS TO BE TOO HIGH AND THAT ALLOWS YOUR NURONS TO IN CODE AND PERCEIVE AND BASICALLY ALLOW YOU TO THINK REALLY CLEARLY SO YOU SORT OF AVE TO PICK YOUR CONDITION WHAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR BOUTS OF FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION I ACTUALLY DO BOTH SO WHAT I DO AS AS I MENTION BEFORE I EAT MY MEAL SOMETIME AROUND ELEVEN A M MY FIRST MEAL TYPICALLY UNLESS I'M VERY HUNGRY WHEN I WAKE UP AND SO I WILL DO MY WORK OUT AND ONE BOUT OF FOCUSED WORK I WAS THINK OF THIS IS MY HARD WORK EARLY IN THE DAY AND I DO THAT FASTED I'LL BE CONSUMING WATER WITH ELECTROLIGHTS MAYBE ELEMENT OR OTHER ELECTROLIGHTS MAY BE SOME CAFFINE IS WELL IN THE FORM OF YOUR BOMATE OR COFFEE THAT'S MY FIRST FOCUS ABOUT OF NINETY MINUTES OR LESS THAT IS ESSENTIALLY DONE FASTED AND THEN I'LL EAT AND THEN I DO NOTICE AFTER I EAT ISHLY HAVE A DIMINISHED CAPACITY TO FOCUS BUT THEN AGAIN IN THE AFTERNOON I WILL DO ANOTHER NINETY MINUTE BOUT OF FOCUS AND ILL TALK ABOUT SOME THE TOOLS I USE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BOUT OF FOCUS IS OPTIMOL FOR GETTING THE MOST AMOUNT OF FOCUS T WORKDON WITHER NOT IT'S MENTAL WORK OR PHYSICAL WORK ALTHOUGH I TEND TO DO MY PHYSICAL WORK EARLY IN THE DAY IN MY MENTAL WORK BOTH EARLY AND LATE IN THE DAY SO TO MAKE THIS VERY SIMPLE OR AS SIMPLE AS I CAN FOR YOU BEING FASTED IS GREAT FOR FOCUS AN CONCENTRATION PROVIDED YOU'R NOT THINKING ABOUT FOOD THE ENTIRE TIME AND BEING FED IS TERRIFIC FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION ACT HLY CAN IMPROVE NORONAL FUNCTION PROVIDED THAT YOU DIDN'T EAT TOO MUCH FOOD SO ONE WAY TO MANAGE THIS IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LUNCH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T STUFF YOURSELF AT LUNCH THEY U'RE NOT OVEREATING AND TO NOT GET QUITE SO FULL THAT YOU PUT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM INTO THIS PARISIMPATHETIC MODE AND MAKE IT HARD TO FOCUS IN THE AFTERNOON I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A DIP OR EVEN A CRASHIAND ENERGY IN THE AFTERNOON THAT MAKE IT REALLY HARD TO FOCUS FOR THAT REASON I'LL DIST REMIND PEOPLE OF A TOOL I'VE TALKED ABOUT MANY TIMES BEFORE WHICH IS BASED ON THE BIOLOGY OF A DENISINE AND KAFFINE ET CETERA WHICH IS TO DELAY YOUR FIRST CAFFIN AND TAKE TO NINETY TWO A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING UP I KNOW THAT CAN BE PAINFUL FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE I VIOLATE THAT RULE WHEN I'M WORKING OUT VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING I'LL DRINK MY CAFFINE BEFORE MY WORK OUT WHICH OFTEN OCCURS WITHIN YAL THIRTY SIXTY MINUTES OF WAKEN BUT IN GENERAL UNLESS I'M WORKING OUT VERY EARLY I WILL INJEST MY KAFFINE NINETY TO A HUNDRE AND TWENTY MINUTES AFTER I WAKE UP SO AGAN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IF YOU HEAR SOMEBODY OUT THERE SAY BEING FASTED IS OPTIMAL FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION WELL THAT IS TRUE IN ONE CONTEXT AND PERHAPS I DEAL FOR A CERTAIN PART OF THE DAY AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY NO YOU KNOW NURONS RUN ON GLUCOS YOU NEED GLUCOS IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM IN ORDER TO GET THOSE NURONS TO BE TUNED THAT IS TO RESPOND WITH ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THE OPTIMAL WAY WHEN YOURE READING SOMETHING OR WHEN YOUR TRINE TO PERFORM EXERCISE WLL THAT'S ALSO TRUE AND OF COURSE YOU CAN INCORPORATE BOTH I IN FACT AS I JUST DESCRIBED INCORPORATE BOTH FASTED STATES AND FED STATES IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE MY CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS AND AS A BRIEF NOTE ABOUT QUITOSIS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ACTUALLY MANAGE TO TRANSITION INTO QUITOSIS AND OUR MAINTAINING A QEITOGENIC STATE THAT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER CAN ENHANDSBRAINE FUNCTION CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH KEYTONES CAN BE USED AS A SO CALLED OPTIMAL FUEL FOR NURONS THE KETOGENIC DIET WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED IF YOU WILL FOR EPILEPSI HAS A WHOLE RELATIONSHIP TO EPILEPSIN CONTROLLING EPILEPTIC SEIZURES AND IT CAN IN FACT ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE FOCUS CONCENTRATED BRAIN STATES SO IN THE FUTURE I'LL DO AN EPISODE ABOUT QUITOSIS AND BE SURE TO CIRCLE BACK ON HOW TO OPTIMIZE QUITOSIS FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS ARE PROBABLY NOT IN QUITOSIS ARE FALLING A QUITOGENIC DIET SO THAT'S WHY MAINLY FOCUS ON FASTED STATES AND FED STATES AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M THOROUGH A FASTED STATE TO ME WOULD BE A STATE IN WHICH YOU HAVENAN INGESTED ANY CALORIES BUT MAY HAVE INGESTED CAFIINE OR EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT REALLY HAVEN'T INGESTED ANY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CALORIES IN THE PREVIOUS FOR TO ATE OR MAY BEVEN TWELVE HOURS AND AGAIN THERE'S TREMENDOUS VARIATION HERE DEPENNING ON HOW LONG PEOPLE FASTED WHETHER NOT RITIME Y THE STATE RIGHT AFTER PEOPLE WAKE UP ET CETERA AGAIN IF YOUR INTERESTING INTEREMENT IN FASTING BOTH FOR SAKE OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE CHECK OUT OUR EPISODE ON FASTING AT HUBRMAN LAPDOT CALM I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH BACK ON THIS IDEA OF WHICH FOODS CAN INCREASE FOCUS KNOWING THE EPISODE ON D H ST THAT I DID A TOUCHED ON THIS QUITE A BIT AS IT RELATES TO ELIMINATION DIETS NOR THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY AND A TON OF INTERESTS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS INTO WHAT SORTS OF THINGS KIDS AND ADULTS SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T EAT IN ORDER TO REDUCE SYMPTOMS OF EIGHTY EIGHTTY I THINK THAT THE SUM TOTAL OF THOSE DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT REDUCING SIMPLE SUGAR IN TAKE AND CERTAINLY HIGHLY PROCESS FOOD SO ICE CREAM CANDY CHIPS ET CETERA THOSE SORTS OF THINGS REALLY DOES SEEM TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF EIGHTY EIGHTTY IN BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS BUT ONCE YOU MOVE PASS THATING START TO SAY WELL WHICH FOODS CAN IMPROVE CONCENTRATION FOCUS WELL FOODS THAT FOR INSTANCE INCLUDE A LOT OF TYROSINE WHICH IS A PRECURSER TO DOPOMING AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY DOPAMINE IS IMPORTANT IN THIS CONTEXT ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO INCREASE CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS SO THINGS LIKE PARMRGE ON CHEESE CERTAIN MEAT CERTAIN NOTS YOU CAN LOOK UP WHICH FOODS A  CONTAIN HIGH AMOUNTS OF TYRACINE THEREALSO SOME FRUITS VEGETABLES THAT INCLUDE HIHAMOUNTS OF TYRACINE BUT TO BE QUITE DIRECT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE IN CESTING FOODS THAT ARE RICH IN THE PRECURSER MINOACIDS TO DOPOMINE A SEETO COLLING ET CETERA IF YOU ARE CONSUMING LARGE AMOUNTS OF THOSE FOODS THAT IS ONE CAN LOOK AND SEE FOR INSTANCE THAT A STAKE INCLUDES A LOT OF THE PRECURSERS TO A SEIT OF COALING IT AS A MENOACID PRECURSERS TO DOPAMING AS WELL IN THEIR OTHER FOODS THAT WILL DO THAT AS WELL BUT IF I WERE TO INJESTSAY TOO RIBI STAKES THAT'S A LOT OF MEAT AND IT WILL DIRECT A LOT OF BLOOD TO MY GUT AND IT WILL CAUSE ME TO BE SLEEPY AND THAT WILL CREATE CHALLENGES IN ME BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE STATES OF FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION SO THE SIMPLE WAY TO PUT THIS IS IF YOU EAT TOO MUCH OR YOU EAT A VERY LARGE VOLUME OF FOOD YOU ARE GOING TO DIMINISH YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION A THE KEY IS TO EAT ENOUGH THAT YOUR NOURISHED FOR THE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES MENTAL AND PHYSICAL THAT YOU NEED TO PERFORM BUT IF YOUR EADING LARGE MEALS YOU ARE GOING TO DIMINISH YOUR CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS PERIOD I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER NOT KAFFINE CAN IMPROVE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND INDEED IT CAN THERE IS AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF DATA SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT KAFFINE PROVIDED IT'S CONSUMED IN THE APPROPRIATE DOSAGES CAN IMPROVE MENTAL PERFORMANCE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN IT LARGELY DOES THAT THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THE DOSAGE OF KAFFINE OF COURSE IS GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW KAFFINE ADAPTED YOU ARE HOW MUCH KAFINE TOLERANCE YOU HAVE AND THAT IS GOING TO VARY TREMENDOUSLY DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOU INJEST THAT KAFFINE WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD AS I MENTIONED EARLIER BUT THERE IS A KIND OF GENERAL RANGE IN WHICH WE CAN TALK ABOUT KAFFINE AS BEING USEFUL FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND THE RANGE IS BASICALLY FROM A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS I WANT A CAUTION EVERYBODY OUT THERE IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO SUFFERS FROM ANXIETY OR PANIC ATTACKS AND YOU'RE NOT USED TO INJEST IN KAFFINE IND YOU RUN OUT AND INJUST FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF KAFFINE IN THE FORM OF A SPRESSO OR YOUR BAMATE OR AN ENERGY DRANK OR IN PILLFORM THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU YOU'R GOING TO BE SWEATING PROFUSELY YOUR HARTRAIT IS GOING TO INCREASE YOURE GOING TO BE QUITE PANIC  IN FACT OR AT LEAST ANXIOUS SO BE CAUTIOUS WITH YOUR USE AND ADOPTING OF KAFFINE IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY KAFFINE ADAPTED BUT MOST PEOPLE DO QUITE WELL TO INJEST A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF KAFFINE PRIOR TO DOING OND FOCUSED WORK AND AGAIN I RECOMMEND DELAYNG YOUR KAFFINE AND TAKE TO NINETY TO A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING UNLESS YOU ARE USING THAT KAFFINE TO REALLY JOLT YOUR SYSTEM A BEFORE A WORK OUT KAFFINE CAN OF COURSE BE INJESTED IN VARIOUS FORMS EVEN PILLFORM BUT MOST PEOPLE INJEST IN THE FORM OF COFFEI OR MY PARTICULAR FAVORITE WAY TO INJEST KAFFINE IS YEUR BAMATE  IT IS IMPORTANT AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT YOU SHOULD ACTIVELY AVOID THE SMOKED VERSIONS OF YOUR BAMATE AS THEY CONTAIN A LOT OF CARSONAGENIC CANCER PROMOTING COMPOUNDS THERE SOME GREAT ERBAMATE BRANDS OUT THERE THE MOST CAUST EFFECTIVE WAY TO CONSUME IT WOULD BE TO USE THE LOOSELEF TEA IN TO TO POUR WATER OVER THAT THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR BRAN THAT I LIKE I DON'T HAVE ANY AFFILIATION TO THEM WHATSOEVER BUT HAVE USING IT FOR YEARS AS ANA PARKETS AND ORGANIC BRAND THAT IS SOLD I BY MINE ON AMAZON WE CAN FIND IT ELSEWHERE ON THE INTERNETT AS WELL AGAIN I DON'T HAVE ANY AFFILIATION TO THEM IS JUST VERY COSTIFFEC T TA VERY CLEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SMOKED FLAVOR AT LEAST THE ONE THAT I BUY IS NOT THE SMOKED VARIETIES AND NONE OF THE CARSONAGENIC COMPOUNDS ARE IN THERE AT LEAST THAT 'MAWHERE OF AND I LIKE THE WAY IT TASTE AND IT PROVIDES A VERY EVEN LIFT AND AND STIMULAN OF THAT I THINK CERTAINLY WORKS FOR ME AND THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE I KNOW THATHAVE SUGGESTED TO ALSO EN JOY YURBOMATE OR KAFFINE ALSO HAVE OTHER ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IN PARTICULAR THE KAFFINE IN YOURBOMATE AND COFFEE ANDOTHER SOURCES OF KAFFINE ARE KNOWN TO INCREASE THE DENSITY AND EFFICACY THAT IS THE NUMBER AND THE FUNCTION OF DOPAMINE RECEPTORS AND THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN INHUMAN SEVERAL TIMES SO BY INJESTING KAFFINE PRETTY REGULARLY OURACTUALLY INCREASING THE ABILITY OF DOPOMINE TO HAVE THIS EFFECT OF INCREASING MOTIVATION AND DRIVE I TEN TO INJEST KAFFINE ONLY EARLY IN THE DAY ATTEND TO CUT OFF MY KAFFINE AND TAKE SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE OR TWO P M TO IN SURE THAT I CAN GET INTO A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP BUT I REALIZE THAT THEI RE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT IN JEST KAFFINE AS LATE AS TWO OR THREE IN THE AFTERNOON AND CAN STILL SLEEP FIME IT WILL CAUTION THOSE OF YOU THAT THINK THAT YOU CAN DRINK KAFFINE IN THE EVENING OR NIGHT TIME AS STILL FALL ASLEEP ALL OF THE RESEARCH POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF YOUR SLEEP IN THE DEPTH A YOUR SLEEP IS DESERRUPTED EVEN IF YOU ARE ABLE TO FALL AND STAASLY THE SLEEPOUR GETTING AS SIMPLY NOT AS GOOD AS THE SLEEPYOU WOULD GET IF YOU WERE TO SHUT OFF YOUR KAFFINE AND TAKE AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS BEFORE BEDTIME AND IDEALLY MORE LIKE TEN OR EVEN TWELVE HOURS BEFORE BEDTIME BUT OF COURSE THEIR PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS AS WELL O KASO KAFFINE IS INCREASING DOPOMINES FUNCTION BY CHANGING THE NUMBER AND EFFICACY OF DOPAMING RECEPTORS BUT OF COURSE IT ALSO INCREASES OR WAKEFULNESS ARE ALERTNESS AND THAT IS LARGELY THROUGH THE NARROW CEMICAL SYSTEMS RELATE TO A DENISINE WHICH IS A MOLECULE TAT BUILDS UP IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THE LONGER WE ARE AWAKE ITS PART OF THE SLEEPINESS SYSTEM IF YOU WILL MAKES US FEEL FATIGUED OR TIRED AND KAFFINE ALSO OPERATES ON THE EPINEFFER IN THE ADRENNALIN SYSTEM IN FACT IF WE INJEST TOO MUCH KAFFINE WILL SOMETIMES GET THE GIDTERS THOSE GITTERS ARE REALLY THE SIMPATHETIC AS IT'S CALLED NERVOUS SYSTEMS BY IS TOWARD MOVEMENT AND OUR PUPILS WILL DILATE THEY IF SHOULD GET BROADER NOW SOMEWHAT PARADOXICALLY WHEN OUR PUPILS GET BIGGER THE PUPILS OF OUR EYES THAT IS OUR VISUAL WORLD ACTUALLY NARROWS AT BECOMES MORE TUNNEL LIKE NOT R PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE US WHEN OUR PUPILS ARE REALLY SMALL THAT MEANS WE ARE RELAXE IF YE EVERSE SOME REALLY TINESE OR YOPINSIZES PUPILS THEYARE VERY RELAXED IF THEIR PUPILS ARE VERY BIG THE VERY DILATED WELL THEN THEY ARE VERY AMPTOP THER THEY ARE VERY VERY ALERT KAFFINE INCREASES ALERTNESS BY INCREASING EPINEFRON A DRENNALIN RELEASE BOTH IN THE BRAIN AND WITHIN THE BODY AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY THAT IT FACILITATES FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION NOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO INCREASE EPINEFERAN IN THE RAIN AND BODY BESIDES KAFFINE OR OTHER STIMULANTS AND IN FACT THAT HAS BEEN STUDIED THERE IS AN EXCELLENT STUDY THAT WAS CARRIED OUT NOT THAT LONG AGO ON HOW STRESS ITSELF CAN INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO F OCUS AND CONCENTRATE THAT'S RIGHT HOW STRESS ITSELF CAN INCREASE FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE THINK OF STRESS IS IMPAIRING OUR ABILITY OF FOCUS BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE WHEN WE ARE STRESSED IT INVOLVES THE DEPLOYMENT THE RELEASE OF A DRENNALIN EPINEFRAN AND THAT A DRENNALIN BOTH CHANGES OUR VISUAL FIELD INOTHERWARS IT NARROWS OUR VISION TO A MORE TUNNEL LIKE FOCUS THAT IS IT MAKES THE AROW IN OUR METAPHOR OF THE ARROW MORE SHARP AND IT IMPROVES OUR CONCENTRATION THIS MAKE SENSE GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT STRESS WHEN RE STRESS WE CAN TO BE STRESSED ABOUT A SPECIFIC THING WE START ANTICIPATING OR WONDERING OR THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN NEXT WHAT LED UP TO THIS HOUSES CAN IMPACK ME HOW DO I FEEL RIGHT NOW YIT REALLY NARROWS THE CONTECT OF OUR THINKING AND OUR BEHAVIOR IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORATE STUDIES THAT REALLY ILLUSTRATES HOW STRESS CAN IMPROVE CONCENTRATION AND PERFORMANCE IS ONE THAT WAS PUBLISHED NOT THAT LONG AGO AND I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS IN THE SHOW NOTES IT'S A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY IN TWENTY TWENTY THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS NOT SURPRISINGLY ACUTE STRESS IMPROVES CONCENTRATION PERFORMANCE FIRST AUTHOR DEGRUT D E G R OO T E AND THIS STUDY INVOLVE TAKING A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS AND STRESSING THEM OUT OR NOT PRIOR TO A COGNITIVE OR CONCENTRATION TASK AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA IN THIS PAPER BUT I'M JUST GOIN HOME IN ON ONE SPECIFIC SET OF DATA I SHOULD MENTION AS I GO THERE THAT THEY MEASURED THINGS LIKE CORTISALL A STRESS HORMONE THEY MEASURED ANXIETY IN AS A QUITE THOROUGH STUDY AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT CONCENTRATION PERFORMANCE IMPROVED MANYFOLD ISHOUS A FROM HERE 'S A GREATER THAN DOUBLING OF CONCENTRATION AND PERFORMANCE IN THE STRESS GROUP AND STRESS IN THIS CONTECTS WAS PROVIDED USING A STANDARD WAY OF INDUCING STRESS WHAT THEY BASY DO AS THEY BRING SUBJECTS INTO THE LABORATORY AND THEY HAVE TO EITHER DO SOMETHING FAIRLY MUNDANE IN THE CONTROL GROUP OR THEY HAVE TO DO A SIMULATED JOB INTERVIEW IN ARITHMITIC TASK AND THEIRE BEING A VALUATED AS T DOING THIS SO THIS IS AN YOU KNOW INTENSE PSYCHO SOCIAL STRESS YOU OE THE'RE NOT WATCHING ANYTHING DISTURBING THEIRE NOT BEING TROMATIZED IN ANY KIND OF WAY THIS IS FAIRLY LOW LEVELS OF STRESS THAT RAT THEIRE LEVELS OF EPINEFERAN AND WE KNOW THIS FROM THIS STUDY AND OTHER LEVELS OF CORTISALL ANOTHER STRESS HORMONE MODESTLY WITHIN THEIR BRAIN AND BLOOD BUT THAT EVEN MODEST INCREASE IN THESE STRESS HORMONES AND THEIR REPORTED PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVELS OF TRESS REALLY ENHANCE THEIR FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION THIS MAY COME AS SURPRISING CAS YU LIKE MANY PEOPLE THINK CASTRESS REALLY DIMINISHES COGNIVE PERFORMANCE BUT THAT'S ABSOLY WRONG STRESS IMPROVES COGNIVE PERFORMANCE NOW OF COURSE THEIR OTHER WAYS TO INCREASE STRESS LEVELS AND TO DO THAT IN HEALTHY WAYS TO IMPROVE CONCENTRATION IN PERFORMANCE AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT SO SURE FIRE AND ITS GENERALLY SAFE PROVIDED YOU DO IT SAFELY IS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THIS IS SOMETHING IAVE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PODCAST BEFORE BUT DELIBERATE COL EXPOSURE CAN BE ACHIEVED BY GETTING INTO A COLD SHOWER FOR ONE TO FIVE MINUTES I FE'RE NOT USED TO IT YOU PROBABLY WONE A START WITH ONE MINUTE A WERE YOU CAN GET INTO AN ICE BATH AND NOWDAYS THERE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL SOURCES OF CIRCULATING COLD WATER OR IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A BODY OF COLD WATER LIKE A LAKE OR A POOL OR ANOCIAN WE KNOW THAT GETTING INTO COLD WATER OR UNDER COLD WATER GREATLY INCREASES EPINEFRAN LEVELS AND DOPOMINE LEVELS IN THE BRAIN AND BLOOD THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY THAT SHOWED THAT THE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE ARE MASSIVE YOU KNOW IT INEAR DOUBLING OR MORE OF DOPOMIN LEVELS THAT ARE VERY LONG LASTING FOR HOURS AND EPINEFERON AND INDEED CORTISALL LEVELS ARE ALSO INCREASED AND IN WAYS THAT SUPPORT NOT JUST IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION BECAUSE THEY DO THAT BUT AND MOOD BECAUSE IT DOES THAT BUT THIT CAN REALLY IMPROVE CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS I TOUCH ON THIS ELOBIT IN AN EPISODE ABOUT MEMORY THAT THERE IS AN AGE OLD PRACTISE REALLY DATING BACK TO MEDIEVAL TIMES OF PUTTING PEOPLE INTO COLD WATER RIGHT AFTER THEY LEARN SOMETHING IN ORDER TO SPIKE TO INCREASE THEIR EPINEFERAN AS A WAY TO CONSOLIDATE THOSE MEMORIES FOR SAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WAYS TO IMPROVE FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION YOU NEED TO IN INCREASE YOUR EPINEFRON YOU ARE DENALIN LEVELS COLD WATER EXPOSURE IS ONE OF THE MOST DEFFICIENT WAYS TO DO THAT IS IS NOT A BIO HACK I DON'T LIKE THE WORD HACK I KNOW IT'S COMMONLY USE BUT A HACK IS SOMETHING WHERE YOURE USING ONE THING FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE THAN IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED FOR AND HERE NOT REFERRING TO THE SHOWER THE COLD BATHOM REFERRING TO EPINEFERAN EPINEFRONT IS ANERO CHEMIC AL THAT WILL PLACE YOUR VISION INTO MORE OF A TONAL MODE WHICH WAL ALLOWUE TO FOCUS ON COGNA OF WORK OR PHYSICAL WORK IN A MORE SPECIFIC WAY YOU'RE NOT GONG TO BE IS DISTRACTABLE AND IT'S VERY EASY TO ACHIEVE BY GETTING INTO A COLD SHOWER OR COLD BODY OF WATER FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK HOW LONG TO GET UNDER OR INTO COLD WATE AND HOW COLD TO MAKE IT HERE'S A THING IT SHOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLY COLD BUT SAFE TO STAY IN FOR ONE TO FIVE MINUTES O CASE SO UNCOMFORTABLY COLD THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO GET OUT BUT SAFE TO STAY AN NOT SO COLD THATTS CAN GIVE YOU HARD ATTACK AND NOT SO WARM THAT IT'S COMFORTABLE THAT IT DOESN'T CREATE THAT A DRENALIN RELEASE COLD WATER EXPOSURE I SHOUST A DELIBERATE COLD WATER OR NON DELIBERATE COLD WATER EXPOSURE RELIABLY INCREASES EPINEFERAN LEVELS IT IS INCREDIBLY USEFUL AS A TOOL FOR THIS AND IT IS IN FACT ZERO COST OR EVEN NEGATIVE ZERO COST HOW TO BE NEGATIVE ZERO COST WELL YOU CAN CERTAINLY SAVE ON YOUR HEATING BILL BY TAKING A COLD SHOWER SO THAT'S ONE WAY AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT OF ACCESS TO DEVICES OR LOCATIONS WE CAN GET INTO COLD WATER CAN SUBMERGE WHILE THE NHAT CAN WORK FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T MAY BE TAKE A COLD BATH YOU GET IN UP TO YOUR NACK THAT'S GOING TO BE MOST EFFICIENT FOR THOSE O YO THAT CAN'T DO THAT YOU GT UNDER A COLD SHOWER AGAIND IT SHOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLY COLD TO THE POINT WE WANT TO GET OUT BUT THAT YOU CAN SAFELY STAY IN FOR ONE TO FIVE MINUTES HOW LONG SHOULD YOU DO IT BEFOR WORKABOUT WELL IF YOU GET INTO REALLY COLD WATER IT'S UN COMFORTABLY COLD AND GET O UT AFTER ABOUT THREE MINUTES YOUR PROBABLY GOOD TO GO DRY OFF AND GET TO WORK SOME OF YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS LITTLE BIT SILLY AS A TOOL FOR FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA ON EPINEFREN AND HOW POWERFULLY CAN INCREASE FOCUS I THINK YOU BE VERY IMPRESSED I MEAN IT CERTAINLY CAN INCREASE ONE'S ABILITY TO A TEND TO SPECIFIC VISUAL STIMULE SO FOR READING OR MATH WORK ET CETERA IT'S GOING TO BE VERY USEFUL OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SO COLD THAT YOUR SHIVERING AND CHATTERING THE WHOLE TIME AND OF COURSE YOU COULD IF YOU LIKE COMBINE THIS WITH FORTY HURTS BY NORAL BEATS THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU COULDN'T COMBINE THE TWO PROTOCALS BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO AND I THINK OUGHT TO LEVERAGE THE HEALTH PROMOTING AND POWERFUL A FECTS OF INCREASING EPINEFEREN ON FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION AND RUNNING OUT AND GETTING STRESSED BY A LIFE EVENT OR GETTING INTO AN ARGUMENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SIMPLY AS A WAY TO INCREASE FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION DOESN'T SEEM THAT ADAPTIVE TO ME SO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TO DO THAT IT DOESN INVOLVE ANY ONE ELSE AS PAS YOU COULD DO IT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE BUT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY ONE ELSE AND AGAIN THERE ARE ZERO LOW AND EVEN NEGATIVE COSTWAYS TO APPROACH THAT IF YOU LIKE TO KNOW HOW LONG THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF EPINEFRON LAST TOWARD IMPROVING FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION WIT WLLY U LOOK TO THAT STUDY FROM DEGRUTE AT ALL THE ACUTE STRESS IM PROVES COGNVE PERFORMANC STUDY THEY MEASURED CONCENTRATION BE FOURE AND THIRTY MINUTES AFTER THE STRESS WAS INDUCED AND THERE DOES APPEARE TO BE A QUITE LONG LASTING REALLY UP TO AN HOUR OR MORE EFFECT OF INCREASING EPINEFRON SO HOW MIGHT YOU APPLY THESE SORTS OF PROTOCALS EARLY IN THE DAY OR LATER IN THE DAY WELL ONE SUGGESTION OR ONE POTENTIAL PROTOCOL WOULD BE IF YOURE GOINGTO SIT DOWN AND DO SOME WORK AND IF YOU ARE ALREADY FEELING A LERT IN FOCUS NO NEED TO REACH TO THIS TOOL BUT IF YOUR FEELING LIKE YOURE FOCUS AN ALERTNESS ISN'T QUITE WHERE YOU LIKE IT TO BE YOU COULD TAKE A THREE MINUTE VERY COLD SHOWER OR SUBMERGE YOURSELF IN COLD WATER FOR THREE MINUTES YOU MIGHT HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE AS WELL AND THEN SIT DOWN AND DO THAT WORK MAY BE EVEN THROW IN THE FORTY HURTS BY NORAL BEATS ALL OF THAT WOULD BE LAYERING IN THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT IFER NORRO CHEMICALS SUCH AS A SEETO COLING EPINEFERON AND DOPA MEAN THAT EGIN TO LEND THEMSELVES TO A REALLY TERRIFIC NINETY MINUTE OR LESS WORK ABOUT NOW I LIKE TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE PURELY BEHAVIOURAL TOOLS THAT QUALITY PERE REVIEWED SCIENCE SAY CAN IMPROVE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE BEGINNING OF TO DAY'S EPISODE A TALKED ABOUT THE STUDY FROM DOCTOR WENDYS'S ZUKI'S LAB WHERE THEY EXPLORED A THIRTEEN MINUTE MEDITATION DONE EVERY DAY FOR A PERIOD OF EIGHT WEEKS THAT MEDITATION LED TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION ABILITY AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS OF COGNIVE PERFORMANCE IT ALSO IMPROVED MOOD AND REDUCED STRESS SO YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS MEDITATION THE MDITATION IS VERY SIMPLE N IT'S ONE THAT ANY ONE CAN PERFORM WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IS SET A TIMER FOR ABOUT THIRTEEN MINUTES I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO BE EXACTLY THIRTEEN MINUTES BUT SINCE THAT'S WHAT THEY INCLUDED IN THE STUDY YOU WOULD SET A TIMER FOR THIRTEEN MINUTES YOU WOULD SIT OR LIE DOWN CLOSE YOUR EYES AND YOU WOULD S IMPLY FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MEDIFIT FROM ONLY DOING THAT BREATHING THROUGH THEIR NOSE BUT IF YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF OBSTRUCTION OR INABILITY O BREATHE JUST THROUGH YOUR KNOSE YOU COULD PROBABLY ALSO DO IT BY BREATHING THROUGH YOUR NOSE END MOUTH OR JUST YOUR MOUTH BUT IDEALYO WOUL DO JUST NASAL BREATHING FOR A PERIOD OF THIRTEEN MINUTES CONCENTRATING ON THAT BREATHING AND CONCENTRATING MEANING BRINGING YOUR AWARENESS YOU'RE SO CALLED INTERROCEPTIVE AWARENESS IF YOU WANTED TO GET REALLY OT TECHNICAL ABOUT IT YOUR INTERACEPTIVE AWARENESS TO APPOINT JUST ABOUT AN INCH INSIDE OF YOUR FOREHEAD NOW OF COURSE THAT MIGHT SOUND KIND OF GORY TO SOME OF YOU NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN INSIDE YOUR FOREHEAD BUT JUST ABOUT AN INCH BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD IS WHERE YOU WOULD WANT A PLACE YOUR CONCENTRATION WHILE ALSO CONCENTRATING ON YOUR BREATHING HERE'S THE THING ABOUT MEDITATION THAT ALL STUDIES OF MEDITATION SHOW WHICH IS THAT UNLESS YOU ARE A VERY EXPERIENCE MEDITATOR YOUR CONCENTRATION YOUR FOCUS WILL DRIFT AWAY FROM YOUR BREATHING AND AWAY FROM THAT LOCATION ABOUT AN INCH INSIDE YOUR HEAD INSIDE YOUR BRAIN ABOUT JUST BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD THAT WILL HAPPEN MAYBE EVERY TEN SECONDS EVERY TWENTY SECONDS MAYBE EVEN EVERY FIVE SECONDS BUT AN IMPORTANT PART OF SUCH A MEDITATION PRACTISE TO IMPROVE CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS IS THAT YOU ARE CONTINUALLY RE FOCUSING BACK TO THAT SPECIFIC LOCATION AND REFOCUSING BACK ON YOUR BREATH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AGAIN IS NOT OFTEN DISCUSS PEOPLE THINK THAT IF YOU DO A MEDITATION AND YOUR FUST TO CONCENTRATED ON YOUR BREATH THAT IF YOUR MIND DRIFTS THAT SOMEHOW YOU FAILED IN THAT MEDITATION BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE A HUGE COMPONENT OF IMPROVING YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE BY WAY OF NURL PLASTICITY REWIRING OF THE CIRCUTS FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION IS THE REPEATED RETURN TO A STATE OF FOCUS FROM A STATE OF NON FOCUS OR DIMINISHED FOCUS AS SO THINK ABOUT IT LIKE TRING TO DRIVE DOWN THE FREEWAY AND STAYING BETWEEN THE LAY LANELINES SCUSE ME AND EVERY ONE IN A WHILE BECAUSE THERE'S A BIT OF DRIFT ON THE VEHICLE MAYBE THE WHEELS ARE IN A LINE CORRECTLY OTHER SOMETHING ELSE WRONG WITH THE CHASSY OR THE STEERING DEVICE IT STARTS TO DRIFT RIGHT A LITTLE BIT THAN YOU HIT THE RUMBLE STRIPPED GAND THEN YOU PULL BACK TO THE CENTR THAT'S REALLY WHAT A FOCUSED MEDITATION PRACTIS IS ABOUT AS OPPOSED TO EXPECTING YOURSELF TO STAY BETWEEN THE MENTAL LANE LINES SO TO SPEAK SO IFYOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO DO A PRACTIS OF THE SORT THAT I DESCRIBED IN THIRTEEN MINUTE MEDITATION PRACTIS EVERY DAY YOU'D WANT TO SIT OR LIE DOWN CLOSE YOUR EYES STRURT A CONCENTRATE ON YOUR BREATH FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON A LOCATION ABOUT IT INCH BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD AND THEN FULLY EXPECT THAT AT SOME POINT YOU'LL BE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S A CUE TO FOCUS BAC TO THAT LOCATION JUST ABOUT AN INCH BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD AND BACK TO YOUR BREATH BY DOING THAT REPEATEDLY OVER AND OVER WHAT YOURE REALLY TRAINING UP IS THE NET WORK WITHIN YOUR BRAIN THAT INDEED INCLUDES THAT PREFRUNTAL QUORTEX THAT YOUR FOCUSING ON IS WELL AS SOME OTHER STRUCTURES THE INFOR A TEMPORAL CORTAX INDEE THE HYPPOCAMPUS A STRUCTURE SOCIATE WITH MEMORY ANOTHER COMPONENTS OF THE NURL CIRCUT THAT ARE INVOLVED IN DIRECTING OUR MENTAL FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AGAIN I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PRACTIS BEING ONE OF FOCUSING AND REFOCUSING IN FACT I WOULD PREFER TO CALL SUCH A PRACTIS A REFOCUS FOCUS MEDITATION OR A CONSTANTLY REFOCUSING OR MAY BE ALL CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER NAME FOR IT I'M CERAINLY NOT THAT GOOD AT NAMING THINGS BUT THIS SORT OF MEDITATION PRACTIS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE STUDY BUT THE SAZUKI LAB AND OTHER STUDIES TO REALLY IMPROVE PEOPLES ABILITY TO FOCUS AND REMAIN FOCUS SO MUCH SO THAT IN THE BEAUTIFUL BOOK ALTERED STATES THEY DESCRIBE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEDITATION PRACTISES SOME A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN THE ONE THAT I DESCRIBED ONE THAT SEVENTEEN MINUTES ANOTHER ONE THAT'S THIRTY MINUTES SOME PEOPLE MEDITATE AS LONG AS SIXTEY MENUTES A DAY ALTHOUGH THAT'S QUITE A LONG TIME IN MY OPINION THE POINT HERE ISN'T HOW LONG YOU FOCUS OR SOMEHOW TRYING TO ACHIEVE TOTAL FOCUS FOR THE ENTIRE THIRTEEN MINUTE OR SEVENTEEN MINUTE OR SIXTEE MINUTE BOUT OF MEDITATION WHILE THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL AND I TING MANY PEOPLE AS PIOR TO DO THAT THAT'S A LOT OF HARD MENTAL WORK I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE INCLUDING MYSELF A RELATIVELY SHORT MEDITATION PRACTIS OF ABOUT THIRTEEN MINUTES IN WHICH YOU FULLY EXPECT YOUR FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION TO DRIFT BUT THAT YOU ARE CONTINUALLY REFOCUSING IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE YES INDEED THE MOST EFFACTIVE AT TEACHING YOURSELF TO FOCUS AND STAY CONCENTRATE IN FACT I INVITE YOU TO INTERPRET EVERY TIME THAT YOU FOCUS OFF THAT LOCATION ABOUT ONE INCH BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFOCUS IN THING ABOUT THE REFOCUSING AS THE TRIGGER FOR TEACHING YOUR NURL CIRCUS HOW TO FOCUS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME AND AS A BONUS TO THAT SORT OF MEDITATION PRACTISE THE STUDY FROM WHEN E SUZUKI'S LAB ALSO SHOWED THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP AND IMPROVEMENTS IN MEMORY SO NOT JUST IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD AND REDUCTION AND STRESS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION BUT ALL THESE OTHER POSIVE MENEFITS FROM JUST DOING THAT THIRTEEN MINUTE A DAY MEDITATION PRACTISE IT'S ONE THAT I'VE STARTED TO ADOPT AND HAVE FELT TREMENTOUS BENEFIT FROM AND THAT I ENCOURAGE MANY OF YOU TO TRY AS WELL THE ONE COUTIONARY NOTE IS THE ONE THAT I MENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WHICH IS BECAUSE THE REFOCUS AS I'LL CALL IT MEDITATION DOES INVOLVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EFFORT AND ENGAGEMENT OF THESE PREFRUNTAL CORTICAL CIRCUS IT IS THI SRUPTIVE TO SLEEP IF PERFORM TOO CLOSE SLEE TO SLEEP SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO THAT PRACTIS I RECOMMEND THAT YOU NOT DO IT WITHIN THE FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO YOUR BEDTIME EARLIER I MENTION THAT I WOULD TALK ABOUT WAYS TO IMPROVE FOCUS IF YOU ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'M ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH I PUT A LOT OF EFFORT IN TO OPTIMIZING MY SLEEP THAT SOMETHING THAT WITH EACH PASSING YEAR I PUT MORE AND MORE EFFORT IN TO AGAIN BECAUSE SLEEP IS SO VITAL FOR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OF ALL KINDS BUT CERTAINLY IN MY ROLE AS A STUDENT IN MY ROLE AS A PROFESSOR AND IN MY ROLEIN LIFE I'VE HAD NUMEROUS TIMES IN WHICH I SIMPLY DID NOT GET ENOUGH SLEEP OR MY SLEEP WAS TERRIBLE FOR WHATEVER REASON AND YET I STILL HAD WORK DEMANDS AN SOCIAL DEMANDS ET CETERA ONE PRACTICE THAT IS VERY EFFECTIVE IT ALLOWING YOU TO FOCUS BETTER THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE UNDER CONDITIONS OF SLEEP DEPROVATION IS SO CALLED NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST OR ANSTAR THIS IS ALSO REFERRED TO SOMETIMES AS YOGANEDRA YOGENEDRACTION MEANS OGU SLEEP YOGENEDRA IS A PRACTICE OF LYING DOWN FOR ABOUT TEN TO THIRTY SOMETIMES EVEN AS LONG AS SIXTY MNUTES YOU LISTEN TO A SCRIPT IT'S AN AUDIOSCRIPT THAT TAKES YOU THROUGH A PROGRESSIVE DEEP RELAXATION INVOLVES A BODY SCAN SOME LONG ACAL BREATHING IT IS VERY RESTORATIVE IN THE SENSE THAT ONE TENDS TO EMERGE FROM YOGENEDRAOR NESTIAR FEELING GREATLY REFRESHED COMPARED TO HOW YOU FELT PRIOR TO IT THERE IS ALSO TERRIFIC NORO IMAGING DATA FROM LABORATORIES IN DENMARK SHOWING THAT THERE'S A RESTORATION OF DOPOMINE LEVELS IN THE SOCAL BASO GANGLIA AFTER NESTIAR A K YOGENEDRA WHETHER NOT YOU CALL IT YOGENEDRA OR NESTIAR WHICH IS WHAT I REFERD TO IT AS NON SLEEPDY BREAST YOU CAN FIND THESE SCRIPTS AT ZEROCOS MULTIPLE PLACES YOU CAN FIND THERE CERTAIN APS THAT AR EN ESTIR YOGENEDRA APS THERE IS A N ESTIAR PROTOCAL THAT WAS PUT OUT THEREBY MADE FOR WHICH IS ON UTUBE THAT YOU CAN ACC US FOR FREE THERE IS A N ESTIAR OR I SHOULD SAY A NUMBER OF ENESTIAR PROTOCOLLS THROUGH THE VIRTISAN AP THERE AGAIN NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PLACES THAT ONE CAN AC US ANESTIAR PROTOCALLS I DO NESTIAR FOR TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES PER DA EVERY SINGLE DAY NOT JUS ON DAYS WHERE I'M SLEEP DEPRIVE IF I HAPPEN BE SLEEP DEPRIVED I WOULD EXTEND THAT NESTIAR TO THIRTY OR SIXTY MINUTES AND WHEN YOU DO THAT NESTIAR WILL DEPEND ON WHEN YOU HAVE TIME FOR THAT NESTIR WHEN I HAVEN'T SLEPT WELL WHAT I'LL TRYING DO IS FYING A QUIET PLACE WHERE I CAN DO ANESTR FOR THIRTY OUR IDEALLY SIXTY MINUTES SOMETIMES I WILL FALL BACK O SLEEP DURING THAT ENESTIAR THAT'S FINE IF YOU DO THAT BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL STAY AWATURING THE ANESTIR AND THEN I'LL EMERGE FROM THAT AND GO ABOUT MY DAY IF IN THE AFTERNOON I'M VERY FATIGUED BECAUSE OF LACK OF SLEEP I MIGHT DO ANOTHER ANSTIAR OF TEN TO THIRTY OR SIXTY MINUTES AND THEN ANOTHER WORKABOUT AGAIN NSTIAR SOMETHING I DO EVERY DAY I TALKD A LOT ABOUT THIS IN THE EPISODES RELATED TO SLEEP BECAUSE IT CAN HELP YOU GET BETTER AT FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP AT NIGHT IN ADDITION TO FEELING RESTORATIVE IN THAT IMMEDIATE TIME FRAME OF THE DAY IN WHICH YOU DO IN T ENESTAR SO IT'S IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL AT VARIOUS TIMES AND FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES BUT HERE WITHIN THE CONTECTS OF TRYING TO CONCENTRATE IN FOCUS WHEN YOUR SLEEP DEPRIVED N ESTAR A K YOGENEDRA IS AN IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL PRACTICS THEREIS GROWING AMOUNTS OF QUALITY SCIENCE POINTING TO THE NER CHEMICAL REPLENISHING EFFECTS AS I MENTION BEFORE DOPOMINE BUT ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR N ESTIAR TO REPLACE SLEEP THAT YOU'VE LOST I WE NEVER WANT ANY ONE TO TRYING USENESTIARS A TOTAL REPLACEMENT FOR SLEEP BUT UNDER CONDITIONS IND WHICH YOU CANNOT CONTROL YOUR SLEEP NESTIAR IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY THAT I AM AWARE OF TO RESTORE YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE FOR WHATEVER PURPOS AND IF YOU EMERGE FROM YOUR ANASTAR AND THEN DRINK SOME KAFINIOAL NOTICE AN EVEN GREATER CAPACITY FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION FOR ALL THE REASONS DIRECTLY RELATE TO KAFINE SO AGAIN AN ESTAR IS A GENERAL TOOL FOR INHANCING YOUR ABILITY TO SLEEP AND IT'S A TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR AT LEAST TO SOME DEGRI COMPENSATE FOR LOSTSLEY WHEN YOU NEED TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE ONE THING THAT REALLY CONTRASTS AN ES DIAR AND YOGANEDRA WITH THE SORT OF FOCUS MEDITATION THAT AVE TALKED ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO THE THIRTEEN MINUTE MEDITATION IS THAT DURING THE THIRTEEN MINUTE MEDITATION YOU'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO REFOCUS AND FOCUS WHEREAS DURING ANESTIAR IN YOGANEDRAA YOUR ACTUI TRYING TO DE FOCUS SO YOU CAN THINK OF THE THIRTEEN MINUTE MEDITATION FOR REFOCUSING AND FOCUSING AS DERECTLY TAPPING INTO AND MEDIATING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CIRCUITRY FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION WHEREAS YOU CAN THINK OF ENESTIR AND YOGANEDRA AS MODULATING YOUR BRAIN EMBODY STATE TO A LOW YOU TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE BETTER NOW ANOTHER TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE TO DIRECTLY TAPPIN TO THE CIRCUTS FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND TO GREATLY ACCELERATE NURO PLASTISITY THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE I SHOULD SAY THE CHANGES IN THOSE CIRCUITS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE BETTER IS HYPNOSIS A LOT OF PEOPLE HEARE HYPNOSIS AND THEY THINK STAGESHYPNOSIS YOU KOW PEOPLE SQUACKING LIKE CHICKENS IND DOING THINGS AGAINST THEIR WILL BUT A SHE HYPNOSIS IS A A TYPICAL BUT HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE BRAIN STATE THAT'S BEEN STUDIED WITH A LOT OF RIGER AT STAMFORD UNIVERSIY SCHOOL MEDICINE BY MY COLLIGUE DOCTOR DAVID SPEAGAL HE'S BEEN AGUEST ON THIS PODCAST PREVIOUSLY HYPNOSIS IS UNIQUE BRAIN STATE BECAUSE IT'S ONE IN WHICH YOU ARE DEEPLY FOCUSE AND YET DEEPLY RELAXED SO TOS A SORT OF SET UP THE ARRAY OF PRACTISES HERES YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THEM LOGICALLY THE FOCUS REFOCUS MEDITATION IS BASED ON AND FOCUSED ON FOCUS NO PUNINTENDED AND ASTIAR IN YOGANEDRA R AIMED AT DEEP RELAXATION HYPNOSIS IS THIS A TYPICAL VERY POWERFUL BRAIN STATE IN WHICH YOU COMBINE HIGH LEVELS OF FOCUS AND DEEP RELAXATION NOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A TOUGH ONE TO JUST TAKE ONESELF INTO BUT FORTUNATELY THERE IS A TOOL BASED ON A LOT OF QUALITY PEREVIEWED RECEARCH FROM THE SPEAGALAB ANOTHER LABS AND THAT IS THE REVERIAP R E VE E RI THE REVERIAP IS AVAILABLE FOR NO COST AT LEAST FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THE I THINK THEY PLACE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF IT BEHIND A PAYWALL BUT YOU CAN TRY AT ZERO COST IT'S AVAILABLE FOR APPLE SOON I THINK ALSO TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID AND THEY HAVE SPECIFIC HYPNOSIS PROTOCALS THAT YOU LISTEN TO AND THESE ARE VERY BRIEF PROTOCALS FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS YOU'RE LISTENING TO A PARTICULAR AUDIOSCRIPT OF DAVID SPEAGL HIMSELF AND SOME PROGRESSIVE BREATHING AND ACHISOME I MOVEMENTS THAT ARE DIRECTLY LING TO THE NURL CIRCITS THAT ALLOW FOR THESE HIGHLY FOCUS DEEPLY RELAX STATES AND THERE ARE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE REVERYAP SPECIFICALLY GEARED TOWARDS IMPROVING FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION SO AGAIN THERE'S MEDITATION FOR FOCUS THERE'S DELIBERATE DECOMPRESSION ANESTY ARE YOGONEDRA WHICH TAKE YOU INTO DEEP RELAXATION AND THEN HYPNOSIS IS THIS VERY SPECIAL VERY DIRECTED STATE OF HIGHLY FOCUS AND HIGHLY RELAX TRICHIS A DEEPLY RELAX THAT ALLOW ACCESS TO THE NURAL CIRCUTS FOR FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION AND ALLOW YOU TO TUNE THOSE UP IN TO IMPROVE THOSE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IN A VERY BRIEF AMOUNT OF TIME AND AGAIN SOME OF THOSE HYPNOSISCRIPTS ARE ASSHORT AS EIGHT MINUTES SUMMER AS LONG AS THIRTEEN MINUTES SO WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE OR ZERO COST TOOLS THAT DIRECTLY TAP INTO THE NURAL CIRCUTS THE COMPONENTS WITHIN YOUR BRAIN THAT ALLOW FOR DEEP RELAXATION ALLOW FOR DEEP FOCUS AND IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS IND CONCENTRATE OVER TIME SIMPLY BY REPEATING THESE HOW OFTEND YOU NEED TO REPEAT THE REVERIE HYPNOSIS FOR FOCUS IND CONCENTRATION BEFORE YOU SEE BENEFITS WILL THAT WILL VARY FROM PERSON O PERSON I TEND TO USE IT ONCE EVERY THIRD OR FOURTH DAY AND OF EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS BENEFITS FROM IT I DON'T THINK I'M UNIQUE IN THAT SENSE THEYHAVE A LOT OF DATA TO SUPPORT THIS REVERY AP IN THE PROTOCALLS WITHIN IT HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO DO ANESTYARE BEFORE YOU EXPERIENCED THOSE BENEFITS THERE I WOULD SAY THE FIRST TIME AN EVERY TIME BECAUSE IT'S SO DEEPLY RELAXING THAT YOU EMERGE FROM AT FEELING QUITE RESTORED RELATIVE TO HOW YOU WENT INTO IT AND AS I MENTIONE EARLIER THE STUDY ON MEDITATION IT TOOK ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS TO SEE THE EFFECTS THAT THEY OBSERVED AN NOTE THAT STUDY BUT THEY DIDN'T OBSERVE SHORTER TIME POINTS SO I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EXPLORE MEDITATION GEARED TOWARDS FOCUS AN REFOCUS ALSO ANESTYARE NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST A KA YOGANEDRA AND THE REVERI AP SPECIFICALLY THE HYPNOSIS WITHIN THE REVERIAP THAT'S GEARED TOWARDS IMPROVING FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION ALL OF THESE HAVE TERRIFIC SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THEM THIS IS NOT WO SCIENCE OR HACK OR TOST SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAME UP WITH THIS IS ALL GROUNDED IN E WORK FROM SOME OF THE BEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD FROM EXCELLENT GROUPS WHOVE LOOKED TO UNDERLYING NURAL MECHANISMS AND MEASURED THINGS WITH A LOT OF RIGOR ET CETERA ET CETERA THESE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE THEM AND IF YOUR INTERESTED IN THE OPTIMAL TIME OF DAY TO DO THESE WE ALREADY MENTION THAT THE FOCUS REFOCUS MEDITATION SHOULDN'T BE DONE TOO CLOSE TO SLEEP THE REVERI HYPNOSIS AP CAN BE DONE AT ANY TIME REALLY IN FACT THEREIS A COMPONENT OF FALLING BACK ASLEEP IN THERE IN OTHERWORDS A HYPNOSIS SPECIVICALLY GEARD TOWARD HELPING PEOPLE TEACH THEMSELVES TO FALL BACK ASLEEP WHEN THEY WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT ANESTY ARE I ALWAYS TAY CAN BE DONE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING IN THE AFTERNOON OR ANY TIME OF DAY IN FACT I'LL SOMETIMES DO THAT THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT IF I HAPPEN TO WAKE UP AND NEED TO GET BACK TO SLEEP SO REALLY THESE TOOLS CAN BE APPLIED MOST ANY TIME OF DAY EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE COVIAT ABOUT THE FOCUS REFOCUS MEDITATION NOT BEING DONE TOO CLOSE TO SLEEP NOW THERE'S ANOTHER SET OF BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THAT CAN REALLY HELP ENHANCE ONE'S ABILITY TO FOCUS AND THOSE ARE VISUAL BASE TOOLS FACT THE TOOLS AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE ARE ACTUALLY BEING EMPLOYED IN NUMBER OF SCHOOLS IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE IN ORDER T TEACH CHILDREN TO FOCUS BETTER AND FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME THE KEEP PRINCIPLE HERE IS THAT MUCH OF OUR COGNITIVE FOCUS ORE BILITY TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY AND STAY FOCUSED ON IT TO READ OR TO FOLLOW A LINE OF CONVERSATION IN OR MATH OR MUSIC ET CETERA IS GOING TO BE DIRECTED BY OUR VISUAL SYSTEM OR VISUAL SYSTEM AS TWO FORMS OF ATTENTION AND FOCUS ONE IS OVERT FOCUS WHICH IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD IF I'M LOKING AT THE TIP OF MY PEN FOR THOSE WYORE LISTENING RIGHT NOW AND LOOKING THE TIP OF MY PEN THAT'S O VERT FOCUS I'M FOCUSING ON IT WITH MY EYES AND OF COURSE THE REST OF MY BRAIN THEN WILL FOLLOW AND START TO ANALYZE THE DETAILS OF WHAT I'M SEEING THE CONTOURS OF THE PEN ET CETERA SEEM SORT OF OBVIOUS WHEN YOU FIRST HEAR IT BUT OUR COGNA FOCUS TENDS TO FOLLOW OUR VERT VISUAL FOCUS THAT'S ALSO WHY THEY PUT BLINDERS ON HORSES THAT'S ALSO WHY SOMETIMES WEARING A HOODY OR A HAT OR LIMITING YOUR VISUAL FIELD IN SOME WAY CAN HELP YOU ENHANCE YOUR COGNAN FOCUS IT CAN HELP LIMIT DISTRACTIONG YOURE JUST NOT SEEING AS MUCH IT'S ALSO WHY WHEN WE IN JUST CAFFINE OR ANY KIND OF STIMULANT OR WE ARE STRESSED AND OUR PUPIL'S DILATE AND OUR VISION BECOMES MORE TUNNEL LIKE LESS PANORAMIC BUT MORE TUNNEL LIKE YOU KNOW THEY SAY A SOTUSTRAW OF YOU WITH THE WORLD ERE LOOKING THROUGH A TUNNEL YOUR FOCUS YOUR VISUAL FOCUS IS ACTUALLY DRIVING YOUR COGNAT FOCUS YOUR COGNA FOCUS IS NARROWER THEN IT WOULD BE IF YOU ARE SEEING THE WHOLE SCENE THAT YOU'RE IN SO WHEN YOU HEAR THIS IT SOUNDS OBVIOUS BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MANY SCIENTIS IS JUST NOT OBVIOUS OF THIS WOULD BE THE CASE HOWEVER THAT IS THE CASE YOUR VISUAL FOCUS DRIVES YOUR COGNAT FOCUS WHAT IS A PRACTIS THAT HAS BEEN STUDIED AND VARIOUS LABORATORIES ON THAT'S BEING EMPLOYED IN VERIOUS SCHOOLS IS TO HAVE CHILDREN OR ADULTS VISUALLY FOCUS ON ONE LOCATION FOR A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME HOW LONG ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY SECONDS TO THREE MINUTES AND BELIEVE NOT THREE MENTS AS A LONG TIME TO MAINTAIN VISUAL FOCUS AT ONE LOCATION YOU IF YOU WERE TO TRY THAT REYNOW YOU'D PROABLY FIND IT TO BE A BIT OF A STRAIN BUT IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT YOU CAN KEEP IN MIND YOU YES ARE ALLOWED TO BLINK BUT ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT MEDITATION REFOCUSING PRACTIS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT THE REFOCUSING IS THE KEY COMPONENT OF TEACHING YOURSELF OR YOUR BRAIN YOU ARE YOUR BRAIN YOUR BRAIN IS YOU BUT TO TEACH YOURSELF HOW TO FOCUS BETER SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO INCORPORATE THIS PRACTIS WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IS PICKA LOCATION IT CULD BE ON A WALL COUL BE ON YOUR COMPUTER IN FRONT OF YOU ALTHOUGH I WOULD ENCOURAGE IT TO NOT BE THE CONTENTS OF YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN YOU MIGHT JUST WANT TO BLANK YOUR SCREEN MIGHT ONT TO PUT A PIECE OF PAPER WITH A CROSS HATCH THEY ARE ANY SORT OF VISUAL TARGET OR YO CAN IMAGINE OF VISUAL TARGET AND THEN FOCUS YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION ON THAT TARGET AND TRY TO BREATHE NORMALLY TRY AND STAY RELAXED AND CERTAINLY ALLOW YOURSELF TO BLINKS T YOUR EYES DON'T TRY OUT THIS IS NOT A TEST OF HOW LONG O YOU CAN GO WITHOUT BLINKING BY FOCUSING ON THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION AND BY FORCING YOURSELF TO REFOCUS ON THAT LOCATION ANY TIME YOURE GAZE YOUR VISION DRIFTS FROM THAT LOCATION YOU ARE ENCOURAGING THE CIRCUTS FOR FOCUS TO GET BETTER AT FOCUSING FOR LONGER AND LONGER AND AT REFOCUSSING WHEN YOU'R FOCUS DRIFTS OFF OF THAT LOCATION THIS IS INCORPORATING NARRL CIRCUTS INCLUDING THE PREFRONTAL QARTEX THINGS LIKE THE FRONTALI FIELD FOR THOSE OF YOU CURIOUS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY THIS PRACTICE IS RECRUTING CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF YOUR SOCAL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX ALSO THE FROM TILL I FIELDS WHICH ARE LOCATIONS NOT FAR FROM THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THAT R INVOLVED IN DELIBERATELY DIRECTING YOUR GAZE TO PARTICULAR LOCATIONS IN SPACE NOT OUTER SPACE ALTHOUGH YOUCOULD DO THE BY FOCUSING ON STARS I SUPPOSE BUT IN VISUAL SPACE NOW I MENTION BEFORE THAT THIS IS OVERT VISUAL FOCUS AND ATTENTION YOU YOU ARE OVERTLY LOCING AT THAT LOCATION BUT ONE ALSO VERY POWERFUL PRACTISE FOR IMPROVING FOCUS AN CONCENTRATION IS TO USE COVERT FOCUS COVERT FOCUS IS WHERE MY GAZE MY EYES ARE FOCUS ON ONE LOCATION SUCH AS MY PEN BUT MY FOCUS IS ACTUALLY DIRECTED ELSEWHERE IN THE ROOM OR LOCATION THAT I'M IN MY MIND END TO SOME EXTEND MY PERIFERAL VISION IS FOCUS IN THIS CASE ON THE DOOR JUST TO MY LEFT IN THE ROOM THAT IAM IN THAT TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFORT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL OLD WORLD PRIMATES OF WHICH WE ARE OLD WORLD PRIMATES ARE ABLE TO DO AND IT PROBABLY EVOLVED AS PART OF THE MECHANISM BY WHICH ANIMALS COULD EVALUATE THE THEIR SCEENE EVALUATE PREDITORS A VALUATE OTHER PRIMATES WHILE NOT NECESSARILY STARING T THEM DIRECTLY SO THEY CAN OBTAIN INFORMATION WE CAN OBTAIN INFORMATION WITHOUT HAVING DIRECT OUR GAZE SPECIFICALLY TO ONE LOCATION MAY BE E CAN OBTAIN INFORMATION FOR MULTIPLE LOCATIONS INDEED WE CAN WITHOUT GETTING TOO FAR DOWN THE RABIT WHOLE OF HOW VISION AND COGNITION RELATE BECAUSE WE'VE DONE EPISODES ON THAT PREVIOUSLY AND SIMPLY FOCUSING ON THE TOOLS THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED TO IMPROVE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION HERE'S WHAT I RECOMMEND SET YOURSELF A LOW BAR AT FIRST AND SET A TIMER AND TRY TO FOCUS ON ONE LOCATION FOR THIRTY SECONDS AND THAT'S IT FOR THAT DAY THE NEXT DAY YOU MIGHT HAVE FIVE SECONDS AND THEN THE NEXT DAY FIVE SECONDS AFTER THAT IF YOU MISSIDATE NO BEGDEAL SIMPLY DO THE PRACTIS FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU DID THE LAST TIME THAT YOU DID THE PRACTICE AND THEND GRADUALLY TRY AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU CAN FOCUS ON ONE VISUAL LOCATION OVERTLY BY LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THAT LOCATION IF YOU LIKE AND IF YOU FEEL YOU HAVE THE ABILITY YOU CAN TRY AND DO THIS THROUGH COVERT ATTENTION AND FOCUS BY LOKING STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR INSTANCE AN ABTENDING TO SOMETHING IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND TRYING TO DO THAT FOR THIRTY SECONDS YOU'LL FIND THAT THAT'S QUITE A BIT HARDER AND THEN EXTENDING THAT BY FIVE SECONDS EVERY TIME YOU DO THE PRACTICE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK YOU NECESSARILY HAVE TO BUILD UP TO BEING ABLE TO DO FOR A FULL HOUR IN ORDER TO EXTRACT THE BENEFITS IN FACT THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS PRACTICE IS AS A MEANS TO GET INTO A FOCUS STATE IF REMEMBER BACK ABOUT AN HOUR SO GO I WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW FOCUS STATES ARE NOT A DROP ALL THE WAY IN AND THEN EXIT TYPE PHENOMENON WE DON'T JUST DROP INTO A FOCUSTATE THE SAME WAY WE DON'T DROP INTO THE PIQUE PERFORMANCE OF A WORKOUT WE WARM UP SO WHAT I RECOMMEND IS HAVING A THIRTY SECOND TO THREE MINUTE PERIOD AT THE BEGINNING OF ABOUT TO FOCUS WERE YOU GOING TO DO WORK OR PHYSICAL WORK AND ANCHORING YOUR VISION TO ONE LOCATION SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM OR IF YOU WANT TO DO IT COVERTLYU CAN DO THAT SETTING A TIME OR ENTRYING TO DO THAT FOR ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY SECONDS TO THREE MINUTES WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU EXERCISE THAT PRACTISE IS YOU ARE RAMPING UP NERL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE NERL CIRCUITS THAT CREATE FOCS AND CONCENTRATION THAND I WOULD STOP LOCING IT THAT LOCATION OR THAT COVERT LOCATION AND THEN I WOULD MOVE TO THE WORK THAT YOUR TRYING TO DO EITHER MENTAL WORK OR PHYSICAL WORK AND IF ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH YOUR NINETY MENUTE BOUND OR AT SOME POINTING OR NINETY MENUTE BOUT OF WORK OR EXERCISE YOU FEEL THAT YOUR CONCENTRATION IS DRIFTING RATHER THAN LOOK AT YOUR PHONE AND SCROLL THROUGH THE THOUSANDS OF CONTACTS THAT EXISTS WITHIN SOCIAL MEDIOR YOUR PHONE TRY JUST PICKING A LOCATION AGAIN ON THE WALL FOCUSSING BACK ON THT LOCATION USING THAT AS A RAMP UP TO THEN DIRECT YOUR FOCUS BACK TOWARDS IF YOUR RAT TRAINING SETS AND REPS THAT YOU MIGHT BE PEFORMING IF YOU'RE RUNNING YOU MIGHT DO THIS OR CYCLING YOU MIGHT DO THIS BY FOCUSSING ON A PARTICULAR LOCATION AND REALLY HOMING IN ON THAT LOCATION PHYSICALLY IND THIS IS A PRACTICE THE LOT OF ATHLETES USE IN FACT AND IF YOUR SAY DOING MUSICAL PRACTISE OR MATH WELL THEN YOU'D WANT A FOCUS ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE TASK THAT YOUR TRING TO PERFORM BUT AGAIN USING VISUAL FOCUS AS A WAY TO RAMP UP AND INCREASE YOURE OVERALL ABILITY TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE AND THEN APPLYING THT TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN OR PERFORM NEXT I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT COMPOUNDS THAT CAN IMPROVE CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS AND THESE ARE MOST OFTEN CONSUMED AS SUPPLEMENTS ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM I SHOULD MENTION CAN ALCO BE DERIVED FROM FOOD AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS CASE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN MODULATE A BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM THAT IS CAN MODULATE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND THERE ARE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN MEDIATE CAN DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS ONE OF THE KEY COMPOUNDS THAT SUPPORTS  CONCENTRATION IN FOCUS BECAUSE IT GENERALLY SUPPORTS MOOD CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS AND BRAIN FUNCTION IN GENERAL ARE THE OMEGA THREE ESSENTIAL FHATIACIDS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE O MAG THREE ESSENTIAL PHATIACIDS IN AVARIETY OF CONTECTS IN PARICULAR DEPRESSION BUT ALSO EIGHTY EIGHTY THE ARE INTERESTING DATA ON THAT AND IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT GETTING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND THREE GRAMS OF E P A THAT IS ONE TO THREE GRAMS OF E P A ESSENTIAL FATIACID PER DAY CAND IMPROVE OUT COMES THAT IS CAN IMPROVE MOOD AND CAN IMPROVE COGNATE OF FUNCTION AND WHILE THERE'S SOME DEBATE ABOUT WHEATHER NOT CAN PROVE CARDIAC FUNCTION IT'S VERY CLEAR AT LEAST TO ME THAT INJUSTING ONE TO THREE GRAMS OF E P SENTIAL PHATIACIDS PERDAY IS BENEFICIAL BUT AGAIN IN THE CONTECTS OF FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION IT'S IN MODULATING THE NERL CIRCUITS AND BRAIN FONCTION THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION IT'S NOT AS IF TAKING ONE OR THREE GRAMS OF EPE ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS PER DAY IS GOING TO TAP DIRECTLY IN TO ONLY THE CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THAT SAID AND AS DISCUSSED ON THE EPISODE OF H HUBERMAN LAPODCAST WITH DOCTORONO PATRIC AND ON THE EPISODE ON EIGHTY GHTY THAT I DID AND ON THE EPISODE ON DEPRESSION THAT I DID I MAKE IT A POINT TO INJEST ONE TO THREE GRAMS OF E PES PER DAY YOU CAN GET THOSE E PES FROM OTHER SOURCES BESIDE SUPPLEMENTS OF COURSE BUT SUPPLEMENTS ARE GOING TO BE THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT YOU COULD DO THAT THROUGH LIQUID FORM FISH OIL CAD LIVE ROYAL SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE VIGAN OPPED FOR OTHER SOURCES OF EPIES YOU CAN FIND THOSE OUT THERE CERTAINLY SOME PEOPLE IEVE IN USE PRESCRIPTION EPIES TO GET THE DOSAG REALLY HIGH DOTERONO PATRICK TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE EPISODE WITH ME THAT'S ISHALLY SOMETHING THAT SHE DOES I DON'T TAKE THE PRESCRIPTIONE FORM I GET THEM THROUGH PILLFORM THROUGH ARE  SUPPLEMENT OF FHILIATE WHICH IS MOMENTOUS BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT QUALITY SOURCES OF EPIES OUT THERE AND SOME OF THOSE QUALITY SOURCES ALSO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE FATY FISH ALGY AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO ILL LEAVE IT TO YOU AS TO WHETHEROR NOT YOU SUPPLEMENT WITH O MAGOTHREE FATIACIDS IN ORDER TO GET THAT ONE TO THREE GRAMS PER DAY OR WHETHER NIGHT YOU DO IT THROUGH FOOD BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRY AND REACH THAT THRESHOLD BECAUSE THERE ARE NUMBER OF KNOWN POSITE OFFACTS FOR MOOD AND BRAIN FUNCTION GENERALLY THE OTHER THING THAT CAN POSITIVELY MODULATE BRAIN FUNCTION AND THAT ACTUALY WORKS AS A FUEL FOR NURONS TO FUNCTION AND CAN IMPROVE COGNIVE PERFORMANCE IN PARTICULAR WITHIN THE BRAIN CIRCUITS SUCH AS THE PREFRONTAL CORTECS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CONCENTRATION IN FOCUS IS CREATINE I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH CRETING MONOHYDRATE FOR ITS EFFECTS ON MUSCLE GROWTH AND STRENGTH AND PERFORMANCE BUT IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THE BULC OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE ROLE OF CREATINE IN THE CLINICAL CONTACTS AND AS ITS ROLE IN IMPROVING COGNAN PERFORMANCE SO MY READ OF THE LITERATURE HAS LED TO A PRACTICE IN WHICH I INJEST FIVE GRAMS PER DAY OF CREATING MONOHYDRATES THE SOR OF STANDARD FORM THATS AVAILABLE IN THIS IS GENERALLY AVAILBLES A POWDER THAT CERTAINLY HOW I TAKE IT I TAKE THE CREATING POWDER 'LL MAKES IT WITH WATER OR MYATHELETIC GREENS OR SOME SORT OF ELECTROLIKE DRINK AT WHATEVER LIQGUID HAPPENS TO BE CONVENIENT TO JEST THAT IN THE TIME OF DAY DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT SOME PEOPLE ARE STRONG BELIEVERS IN CONSUMING CREATINE POST WORK OUT WHILE THAT MIGHT BE BENEFICIALIZED SIMPLY TAKE IT IN THE MORNING OR POST WORK OUT ITS OR OF DEPENDS ON WHEN I REMEMBER TO TAKE IT BUT THAT FIVE GRAHMS OF CREATINE PER DAY IN MY CASE REALLY IS IN GEARD TOWARDS MUSCLE GROWTH OR STREINGTH OR PERFORMANCE AS MUCH AS GEARED TORD TAPPING INTO THE CREATINE FOSPHATE SYSTEM WITHIN THE BRAIN AND SPECIFICALLY THE BENEFITS OF CREATINE FOR PREFRONTAL CORTICAL NETWORKS AGAIN MODULATING NOT DIRECTLY MEDIAM BUT MODULATING AND GENERALLY SUPPORTING THE BRAIN THAT WORKS THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW ME TO GENERATE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION SO MUCH LIKE SLEEP MUCH LIKE A MAGOTHRE FATIACIDS CREATING MONOHYDRATE FIVGRAMS TO DAY SEEMS TO GENERALLY SUPPORT BRAIN FONCTION WHICH WILL GENERALLY SUPPORT CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS NOW IN TERMS OF COMPOUNDS THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY MEDIATE CONCENTRATION OF FOCUS WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT AEROW METAPORE MODEL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNIN O THE EPISODE THAT INCLUDED EPINAPRAN A DRENALINE A SEETO COALING WHICH ACTS AS THIS ATTENTIONAL SPOTLIGHT IN FACT A CEETA COALING AND ELEVATED LEVELS OF SEDAL COLING HAVE BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGH BEAUTIFUL WORK FROM MY MERSONIC SLAB AT YOU C A SAV AND THE KILGARD LAB DOWN IN USTON AND A NUMBER OF OTHER LABS INCLUDING NOR MIMURDER'S LAB IT YOU SEE OURVINE AGAIN GAN TO IMPROVE OR EVEN DIRECTLY GATE NURL PLASTICITY BY INCREASING FOCUS DIRECTLY IT'S A LOT OF WORD SUT BUT BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS IF A SETAL COALING TRANSMISSION IS INCREASED EVEN TRANSIENTLY WITHIN THE BRAIN THERE'S A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR NERL PLASTESI TO TAKE PLACE AND THE REASON THERE'S A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR NURL PLASTES A CA LEARNING TO TAKE PLACE IS BY WAY OF THE INCREASED FOCUS THAT SPIKING A SETAL COLING CAN PROVIDE SI MENTION EARLIER THERE UMBER DIFFERENT FOODS WHICH CAN TAIN COALING YOU CAN LOOK THOSE UP ON LINE COALING ACTING AS AN AMENOACID CREASE CURSOR TO A SEITO COLING BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE COMPOUNDS THE ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN FURTHER AND MORE ACUTELY INCREAE A SEITO COLING AND INDEED I USE THESE MYSELF THE MOST EFFECTIVE ONE I'VE FOUND IS ALPHAG P C ALPHAG P C CONSUMED AT DOSAGES OF THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PRIOR TO A WORK BOUT OR PRIOR TO A WORK OUT GREATLY INCREASE ONE'S ABILITY TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE AT LEAST THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AND THERE ARE SOME GOOD DATA IN HUMANS SO HOW WOULD I USE ALPHAG P C I WOULD USE ALPHAG P C I TAKING IT ABOUT TEN TO TWENTY MINUTES PRIOR TO ANY TIME I WANT TOF FOCUS ARE CONCENTRATE VERY DEEPLY I'VE TAKEN AS MUCH AS SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS AT ONE TIME ALTHOUGH I FIND THAT THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS AS ENOUGH FOR ME AND I TENT TO BE QUITE SENSITIVE TO SUPPLEMENTS AND KAFINE IN GENERAL SO A'LL SOMETIMES TAKE IT A LONGSIDE YOUR BOMATE OR WITH YOUR BAMATE AN OR WITH COFFEE PRIOR TO WORK OUT OR PRIOR TO IT BOUT OF WORK IN WHICH I'M FOCUSSING ON MENTAL WORK ISO COUL BE READING WRITING COULD BE MATH COULD BE DATA AND ALSIS COULD BE ANYTHING WHERE I NEED A LOT OF FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION NOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE CONTACTED ME ABOUT A RECENT STUDY SUGGESTING THAT ALPHAG P C WHEN TAKENG CRONICALLY OVER MANY YEARS COULD INCREASE ONE'S VULNERABILITY TO STROKE HA'VE LOOKED AT THOSE DATA AND MY READ OF THE DATA IS THAT THERE NOT VERY CONCLUSIVE ALTHOUGH ANY TIME YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW IT STUDY THAT'S POINTING TO THE FACT THAT A GIVEN COMPOUND MIGHT INCREASE THE PROPENSY FOR STROKE AVISI WANT TO BE CONCERNED SO WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES HOW BY WHAT MECHANISM THAT IS COULD ALPHAG P C BE INCREASING THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO STROKE AND IT SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO INCREASES IN T M A O WHICH IS A MARKER RELATED TO THE CARTY OF ASCULAR SYSTEM AND ONE KNOWN WAY TO OFFSET INCREASES IN T MAO THAT ARE ASSOCIATED EITHER WITH ALPHAG P C OR IN CREASES DUE TO OTHER THINGS SO INGESTION OF PARTICULAR FOOD COMPOUNDS ASHL CAN INCREASE T  MA O IS TO OFFSET THAT BY TAKING SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF GARLIC NOW I'VE BEEN TAKING ALPHAG P C PRETTY CONSISTENTLY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I DO NOT TAKE IT EVERY DAY I WOULD TAKE TAKE IT ABOUT FOUR DAYS PER WEEK AGAIN PRIOR TO WORK OUTS OR BOUTS OF COGNIVE WORK I HAVE NOT SEEN MY T AMEO SPIKE AND I'VE VALUATE THAT BY WAY OF BLOOD TES BUT NONE THE LESS I TAKE SIX HUNDRE MILIGRAMS OF GARLIC IN CAPSUL FORM ANY TIME I EAT ANY WAY AND I DO THAT FOR GENERAL CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION AND THEIRE SOME INTERESTING DAT ON A MUAN SYSTEM FUNCTION ET CETERA FOR GARLICS I'VE BEEN CONSUMING SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAM CAPSULS OF GARLIC FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME SOME DAYS I'LL IN JUST JUST ONE SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAM CAPSUL OTHER TIMES I'LL TAKE TO BUT BASED ON THIS REASENT STUDY AND THE CONCERNS ABOUT T MEO I MAKE IT A POINT TO ALWAYS IN JESTIC SIX UNDER MILIGRAM CAPSUL OF GARLIC ANY TIME I TAKE ALPHAG P C WHICH AGAIN FOR ME IS ABOUT FOUR DAYS PER WEEK SO IN OUR MODEL OF ATTENTION IN FOCUS YOU CAN NOW CLEARLY SEE WHY TAKING ALPHAG P C WHICH INCREASES A CETOF CULLING TRANSMISSION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR CONCENTRATION OF FOCUS AND WHY TAKING IT WITH A DOUBLESPRESSO OR WHY TAKING IT WITH YER BOMANTE WOULD FURTHER INCREASE CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS BECAUSE AS I MENTION EARLIER CAFINE IS GOING TO INCREASE APINEFERAN IS ALSO GOING TO INCREASE THE DENCITY OF DO'T BE MEN RECEPTORS IN THE ALPHAG P C IS GOING TO INCREASE O T OF CALLING THE SPOTLIGHTING FOR COGNITION THIS ABILITY TO REALLY AMPLIFY THE ACTIVITY OF SPECIFIC NERAL NETWORKS WHICH IS LARGELY WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOURE TRYING TO FOCUS AND PAY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY SO IF ONE WANTS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOBOMINE TRANSMISSION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY FOR SAKE OF INCREASING CONCENTRATION IN FOCUS ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT WAYS TO DO THAT IS BY INJESTION OF THE MENOACID EL TYRASINE GAN ALTYRASINE CAN BE DERIVED FROM FOOD SOURCES IN VITE YOU TO LOOK UP THOSE VERIOUS FOOD SOURCES ON THE WEB SIMPLY GO TO WEBBROWS RAND PUT IN FOODS THAT CONTAIN A LOT OF EL TYRASIN IN YOU'LL GET A RICH ARRAY OF CHOICSES TO SELECT FROM BUT IN MY CASE I USE EL TYRACINE IN CAPSUL FORM I WILL TAKE FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ELTIRASINE THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C AND A CUP OF COFFEE I'M CAREFUL TO DO THIS EARLY IN THE DAY CERTAINLY NOT AFTER TWO OR THREE P M BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH MY ABILITY TO FALL AND STAY ASLEEP THAT NIGHT DO THIS EARLY IN THE DAY BEFORE WORK OUT OR BEFORE A BOUT OF CONCENTRATED MENTAL WORK AGAIN A TEND TO DO THIS ABOUT FOUR DAYS PER WEEK SO CERTAINLY NOT EVERY TIME I SIT DOWN TO DO WORK AND I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT I STILL TEND TO DO THE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS I'LL TEND TO USE FIVE MINUTES OF BI NERAL BEATS OR BI NERL BS THROUGHOUT THE WORK SESSION SOMETIMES DO NICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER BEFORE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT I COMBINE EVERY TOOL THAT IHAVE TALKED ABOUT TO EH FOR A GIVEN WORK ABOUT AND THAT WOULD BE PRETTY WHILD TO TAKE A COLD SHOWER PAPA AND ALTYRACINE TAKE AN ALPHAG P C DRINK TO EXPRESS A LISTENABI NOR RES THAT TO ME SEEMS LIKE A VERY INEFFICIENT WAY TO GO ABOUT LIFE IN FACT I MAKE IT A POINT TO TRY AND USE TOOLS TO INCREASE MY ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE IN FOCUS BUT NOT TO COMBINE MORE THAN TWO OR THREE OF THEM AT ANY ONE TIME AND WHEN I SAY TO OR THREE WHAT I MEAN AS I WILL YOU SUPPLEMENTS LIKE ALPHAG P C ELTIRACINE AND CAFINE TOGETHER BEFORE CERTAIN WORK BOUTS I MIGHT USE THE VISUAL PRACTISE A FOCUSING ON A GIVEN LOCATION FOR A MINUTE BEFORE I BEGIN THAT WORK BOUT AM I COMBINE THOSE THEN ANOTHER TIME I MIGHT TAKE A COLCHOWER PRIOR TO DOING SOME WORK OTHER DAYS I CONFESS I'VE SLEPT VERY WELL OR MY ENTHUSIASM ABOUT WHAT I AM ABOUT TO WORK ON IS SUCH THAT I DON'T REQUIRE ANY OF THESE TOOLS AGAIND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THERE'S NO PRESSURE TO USE ANY OF THESE TOOLS BEHAVIOURAL SUPPLEMENT BASED OR OTHERWISE IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF USING THE TOOLS THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO ACHIEVE THE STATES YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE IN TO A IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO GO INTO THOSE STATES WITHOUT ANY HELP AT ALL AND THIS IS WHAT I FIND PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY PUT YOU INTO THE IDEAL STATE FOR THAT WORK AND THEN YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT WORK AND THEN YOU ALWAYS RELY ON THE SUPPLEMENTS I PREFER TO LOOK AT SUPPLEMENTS OF THE SORT THAT I JUST DESCRIBED AS A ROUT INTO A DEEPER TRENCH OF FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION THAT I USE AS A TOOL TO TEACH MYSELF TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE MORE DEEPLY SUCH THAT I DON'T NEED THOSE TOOLS EVERY SINGLE TIME A TRYING FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE THINK OF SUPPLEMENTS AS A CRUTCH OR A WAY OF SIMPLY GETTING INTO A STATE FOR WHICH NO OTHER TOOL WILL SUFFICE OR REPLACE BUT IN THAT CONTEXT I WANT TO REMIND YOU OF THE LARGER CONTECTS OF PHARMOCOLOGY WHICH IS THE VAST LANDSCAPE OF PRESCRIPTION PHARMOCOLOGY FOR EIGHTY IH  FOR ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPER ACTIVITY DISORDER NOW I COVERED THAT LANDSCAPE IN INTENSE DETAIL ON THE EPISODE ON EGHTY HT AND FOCUS AND JUST TO SUMMARISE THERE IS OF COURSE ATER ALL RIDDLEIN VIVANTS MODAPHINEL ARMODAPHINAL A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS ALL OF WHICH GENERALLY INCREASE DOPOMING TRANSMISSION IN THE BRAINS TO INCREASING DOPLEMEN AND ALL OF WHICH GENERALLY INCREASE EPINEPHRON A DRENDALIN TRANSMISSION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND MANY OF THOSE COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN OF TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO CHILDREN AND EVEN SOME ADULTS WHO SUFFER FROM AGHTY HT SO PROPERLY PRESCRIBED AT THE APPROPRIATE DOSAGE THOSE COMPOUNDS CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE WITH CLINICALLY DIAGNOSE EGHTY HHT THE WAY THEY HELP THOSE PEOPLE IS A BIT SURPRISING HOWEVER YOU MIGHT THINK WELL THEY TURN ON THE BRAIN CHEMICALS THAT ALLOW THOSE PEOPLE TO CONCENTRATE IN FOCUS THAT'S TRUE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF TEACHING THOSE BRAIN CIRCUITS HOW TO ENGAGE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SOMEWHAT PARADOXICALLY GIVING A STIMULANT LIKE RIDDLIN OR ATER ALL TO A KID THAT LEGITIMATELY NEEDS IT OBVIOUSY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITHOUT THE OVERSIHTE AND CAREFUL THE VALUATION OF A PSYCHATRIS BUT GIVING THAT TO A KID WHO HAS SEVERE EIHTY H T YOU WOULD THINK WOULD MAKE THEM REMMORE RAMBUNCTIOUS LESS ABLE TO FOCUS AND MORE DISTRACTABLE OVER ALL AFTER ALL RIDDLEIN MODAPHINEL ARMODAPH AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE STIMULANT SO YOU TAKE A KITO AS ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPER ACTIVITY DISORDER AND GIVE THEM THESE DRUGS THAT INCREASE TRANSMISSION OF DOPOMINE AND EPINEPERONEED THINK OUTS CAN TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE DISTRACTABLE AND HYPERACTIVE AND INDEEDAT HAS THE OPPOSITE OEFFACT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE THEM FEEL CALM BUT IT MAKES THEM FEEL THAT THEY CAN FOCUS THEY REALLY CAN ANCHOR THEIR ATTENTION AND THE IDEAS THAT ITS TEACHING THOSE NEURAL CIRCUITS OR THOSE NORAL CIRCUITS RATHER ARE TEACHING THEMSELVES TO ENGAGE INTO FOCUSE AND CONCENTRATE AND THE IDEAL SITUATION IS ONE IN WHICH THE TOTAL DOSAGE OF THOSE COMPOUNDS THOSE DRUGS CAN BE REDUCED OVER TIME AS THOSE CIRCUITS LEARN TO COME ON LINE THROUGH PURELY BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NOW OFTENTIMES THERE IS A MAINTENANCE OF THOSE DRUGS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME ALTHOUGH THERE IS A COMMON PRACTISE NOW DAYS OF TRYING TO DIMINISH THE DOSAGE OVER ALL THAT'S IN THE CONTECTS OF EGHTY HTY AND PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A LOT INDEED EIGHTY PER CENT OR MORE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS SAY THE STATISTICS ARE USING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN FACT PRESCRIBE THOSE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SO BASELY WHAT I AM SAYING IS THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE USING DRUGS DESING FOR EIGHTY H D AND NARCOLEPSY BECAUSE THOSE DRUGS WILL EFFECTIVELY INCREASE FOCUS IN CONCENTRATION BUT I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THE USE OF POWERFUL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN O PRESCRIBE YOU FIRSIVALITSY LEGAL SECOND OF ALL IT'S QUITE DANGEROUS TO HIT THE ACCELERATOR OF THOSE NEURAL CIRCUITS WITH SUCH VIGOR BECAUSE IT CAN INCREASE DEPENDENCY AND THEY CAN HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHERSIDE EFFACTS OUTSIDE THE CONTACTS OF CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED AND PRESCRIBED  D H D MENICATION BUT IN THE CONTECT OF SUPPLEMENTATION THE INCREASE IN DOPOMIN A SEETO CALLING AND EPINEPERON THAT ONE CAN ACHIEVE FROM SAY FIVE HUNDRED MILOGRAMS OF ALTIRASY AND THREE HUNDRED MILOGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C AND A CUP OF COFFEE IS GOING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THEN ONE WOULD SEE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SO YOU'RE GETTING A MODEST EFFECT THAT CAN SIMILARLY TEACH THOSE BRAIN CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS AN CONCENTRATION HOW TO ENGAGE BETTER BUT AS A GENERAL BATROP TO ALL OF THIS I ALWAYS SAY AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN PROBABLY UNTIL THE DAY I DIE WHICH HOEFULLY IS LONG TIME FROM NOW BUT REGARDLESS ITWILL BE THE SAME MESSAGE I ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS SHOULD COME FIRST BEHAVIORAL TOOSHOCOM FIRST THEN FOCUS ON NUTRITION IN FACTOS A BEHAVIORAL AND NUTRICION TOOLS AND OF COURSE GET EXCELLENT SLEEP THEN FOCUS ON SUPPLEMENTATION AND THEN AND ONLY IF THOSE ARE FAILING TO BRING YOUR BRAIN AND BODY TO THE STATE YOU NEED TO BE IN TO PERFORM WELL IN SCHOOL IN WORK IN LIFE ET CETERA DO I RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE LEAN ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS NOW THERE'S A CAVIA TO THAT WHICH IS IN UNDER CONDITIONS LIKE SEVERE EATING DISORDERS OFSESS AVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER BY PULLAR DISORDER DEPRESSION WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRULY AT RISK OF SUICIDE OR SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH OF FACTS OR BEHAVIORAL HALF EFFECTS AND THERE REALLY AT THERE LIVES ARE AT RISK AND THERE OVER ALL MOOD AND WELL BEING IS AT RISK IT'S OFTEN THE CASE THAT PEOPLE CANNOT ACCESS THE BRAIN STATES REQUIRED TO SHIFT THEMSELVES PURELY WITH BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NUTRITION ET CETERA SO AGAIN FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON WHO'S NOT SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THE PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS I MENTION BEFORE OR OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SKIS A FRENNING ET CETERA I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK TO BEHAVIORAL TOOLS FIRST NUTRITION THEN SUPPLEMENTATION THEND AND ONLY IF THERE'S A REMAINING NEED TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THIS CONTRASTS VERY MUCH WITH THE TYPICAL CENARIOI HEREABOUT THESE DAYS WHERE COLLEGE STUDENTS OR OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY OH YI HEARE THAT THERE'S THIS DRUG YOU KNOW A RIDDL IN OR VIVE VANCAT CAN IMMEDIATELY PUT ME INTO A STATE OF HEIGHTEN FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION NOW LISTEN IF YOU HAVE ED HT BY ALL MEANS TALK TO A PHYSICIAN TALK TO A GREAT PSYCHOATRIST AND FIGURE OUT WHETHR NOT THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU BUT IF YOU DON'T AGAIN BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTATION AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO TEACH YOUR NURAL CIRCUITS HAD A FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE BETTER AND I CANNOT OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT THAT THE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS AND TO SOME EXTENT THE SUPPLEMENTATION COMBINED WITH BEHAVIORAL TOOLS REALLY ALLOW YOU TO TRAIN UP YOUR NURAL CIRCUITS SO THAT YOU CAN FOCUS IND CONCENTRATE TO THE DEPTH AND THE DEGREE AND THE DURATION THAT'S GOING TO BEST SERVE YOUR MENTAL AN PHYSICAL GOALS NOW THERE'S ONE OTHER COMPOUND THAT I'VE USED FROM TIME TO TIME AND THAT I CONTINUE TO USE IN ORDER TO INCREASE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND I WILL USE THIS IN COMMINATION WITH THE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND THAT'S FENAL ETHELAMING FENAL ETHELAMING IS IN THE DOPEMING SYNTHESIS PATHWAY SOT INCREASES DOPEMING TRANSMISTION INTENDS TO FUNCTION A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN ALTIRISINE SO EVERY ONCES AND WHILE I'LL SWAP OUT ELTYRISINE AND PUT IN FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF FENAL ATHELAMING OR SOMETIMES IF I REALLY WANT TO PUSH A LITTLE  HARDER ON THE DOPEMING SYSTEM AND I'M GOING TO BE DOING A LONG BOUT OF INTENSE WORK I WILL TAKE THE THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C THE FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALTARICINE L GENERALLY TAKE THAT WITH SOME CAFINE AND I SHULD MENTION I DON'T GO PAST ABOUT A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF CAFINE CAUSE I DON'T REALLY LIKE FEELING TO GITERY THAT'S NOT REALLY MY GOALETS THE GOAL TO BE ALERT BUT NOT SO ALERT THAT I YOU DON'T REALLY CAM'P FOCUS ON ANYTHING I'M NOT INTEREST IN HAVING AN ANXIETY ATTACK AFTER ALL BUT I'LL SOMETIMES EITHER SWAP IN OR I WILL ADD THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF FENAL ATHELAMING FENAL ATHELAMING IS IN THE P E A PATHWAY OFE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND PREVIOUS PODCASS ON DOPEMING MITIVATION AND DRIVE AND IT SAY VERY SHORT LIV COMPOUNDS SO WHAT I'LL TEND TO DO IS TAKE IT ONCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK ABOUT AND SOMETIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK BOTTLE TAKE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILOGRAM CAPSIL BUT WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED OF COMBINING ALL OF THOSE COMPOUNDS ALPHAG P C ALTIRACINE PINALATHELAMINE AND CAPIN THAT'S A FAIRLY RARE OCURRENTS THAT ILL COMBINE ALL FOUR AND REALLY ONLY UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH I HAVE TO DO IN INTENSELEE CHALLENGING BOUT OF MENTAL OR PHYSICAL WORK I WA SAY THE FREQUENCY AT WHICH I COMBINE ALL FOUR OF THOSE THINGS IS PROBABLY ABOUT ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS IN TYPICALLY MORE LIKE ONCE A MONTH AGAIN BEING CAREFUL TO DO THAT IN THE EALLY PART OF THE DAY CERTAINLY BEFORE THE NEW HOUR SO THAT I AM IN NO WAY GOING TO DISRRUPT MY SLEEP I REALIZE THAT MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING ABOUT OR HOPING THAT ALL DISCUSS THINGS LIKE LIONS MANE OR THE RACITAMS OR SOME OF THE OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT ARE KNOWN TO POWERFULLY MODULATE THE DOPOMINE EPINEPERAN IN A SEAT OFCOLINE SYSTEMS TO BE QUITE DIRECT THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS TO REVIEW IN A SINGLE EPISODE AND THEY ALL GENERALLY TAP INTO THE SAME SET OF PROCESSES AGAIN EPINEPERAN THAT SHAFT OF THE ARROHEAD THAT WERE THINKING OF HIS FOCUS A SEETA COLING WHICH IS THE AEROHEAD ITSELF AND THEN DOPOMINE WHICH IS THE SORT OF PROPELLER BEHIND THE ARROW THAT ALLOWS IT TO CONTINUALLY DRIVE FORWARD THROUGH ABOUT OF MENTAL OR PHYSICAL WORK THERE IS A WONDERFUL SIDE I'VE MENTIONED IT SEVERAL TOUNDS BEFOUR ON THIS PODCAST THAT IS EXAMINED OT CAM THAT WONDERFUL SITE THAT IS EXAMINED OT COM HAS RECENTLY BEEN UPDATED THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR FORMAT IT WAS TERRIFIC BEFORE IT PROVIDED LYNX TO RELEVANT STUDIES IT TALKED ABOUT SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS I TALKED ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF E FFACT TO TALKED ABOUT THE HUMAN EFFECT MADE TRICKS ARE REALLY FOCUST ON HUMAN STUDIES WITH LYNX TO THOSE STUDIES AND ON AND ON THE NEW REVAMPED VERSION OF EXAMINED O CALM IS EVEN BETTER IT'S REALLY NEXT NEXT LEVELIE I REALLY APPLAUD THEM FOR DOING SUCH A TERRIFIC JOB AN ORGANIZING THE INFORMATION THEIR LOT OF INTERESTING PAGES THAT YOU CAN READ THERE ABOUT DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS WE COUD UT IN ANY COMPOUND GINCOBELOBA ON PHOSHODITAL SERINE HEM ALPHAG P C AND YOU'RE GOING TO RICH ARRAY OF INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE COMPOUNDS AND IF YOU WERE TO PUT IN A SPECIFIC GOAL STATE THAT IS FOCUS OR CONCENTRATION OR SLEEP OR HORMONS LIKE TESTOSTRANTS THAT ARE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A RICHARA OF COMPOUNDS SUPPLEMENTS AS WELL AS LYNX TO THE STUDIES ON THOSE COMPOUNDS AND SOME DETAILS ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR STUDIES IS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL SIGHTE TITS ONE THAT I RELY ON THAT I KNOW THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE RELY ON AND I ENCURGE YOU TO CHECK IT OUT AGAIN THE U AREL IS EXAMINE DOT COM SO TODAY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TOOLS AND TO SOME EXCENSO MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS AND REALLY THE GOAL HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE YOU AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE NURCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND LITBUT ABOUT THE NERL CIRCUITS THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO ACHIEVE STATES OF ATTENTION AND FOCUS IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS EPISODES TO THE UROMEN LAB POT CAST WERE IHAVE COVERED THESE TOPICS IN TREMENDOUS DEPTH ATS IT RELATES TO MECHAN ISM AND ALSO FOCUSED ON TOOLS TO DAY I LARGELY FOCUSED ON TOOLS WE TALKED ABOUT BEHAVIAL TOOLS LIKE A MEDITATION THAT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES LONG DONE DAILY SPECIFICALLY TO IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY OF FOCUS AND IN FACT OUR DATA TO SUPPORT THAT IT WILL TALKED ABOUT HYPNOSIS WE TALKED ABOUT VISUAL FOCUS OVERT AND COPHER WE TALKED ABOUT VERY SUPPLEMENTS SUCH AS ALPHAG P C FENALATHLAMIN ELTIRISINE SUPPLEMENTS THAT I USE TO DIRECTLY MODULATE THE NERAL CIRCUS FOR CONCENTRATION FOCUS US ANOCT ABOUT CREATINE THE OMEGA THREES TALKD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP WHICH MODULATES OUR ABILITY TO FUNCTION MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY OVER ALL SO OPTIMIZE THAT SLEEP AND WE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF OTHER PROTOCALS THAT YOU CAN IN CORPORATE MY HOPE IN GIVING YOU ALL THIS INFORMATION IN ONE SINGLE LOCATION IS THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH OF THESE PROTOCALS YOU WOULD LIKE TO INCORPORATE INTO YOUR ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE YOUR FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AGAIN I DON'T RECOMMEND DOING ALL OF THESE PROTOCALS ALL AT ONCE WHEN I RECOMMEND IS PICKING A HANDFUL OF THEM MAY BE ONE OR TWO MAY RE THREE OR FOUR AND TRYING THEM IN DIFFERENT COMMINATIONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY AND FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES FOR MENTAL WORK FOR PHYSICAL WORK ET CETERA AT FIND WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU ONCE AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO TEACH YOUR BRAIN THAT IS TO INCREASE NEROPLASTICITY IN THE NERAL CIRCUITS THAT ALLOW YOU NOT JUST A FOCUS BUT TO RE FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION AND I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THAT IT'S ALSO CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO D FOCUS I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE A PERIOD OF TIME EACH DAY TO DAY DREAM TO WALK DOWN THE HALL WITHOUT LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE TO NOT HAVE TO INCORPORATE MORE CENSORY INFORMATION TO NOT PLACE INCREASING DEMANDS ON YOURSELF TO FOCUS AND SEE AND REALIZE HOW HAVING A PERIOD OF DELIBERATE DECOMPRESTION AND D FOCUSIN CAN ALLOW YOUR BRAIN TO FOCUS SO MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU DO DECIDE TO RETURN TO ABOUT OF FOCUS CONCENTRATED WORK OR PHYSICAL WORK SI WON A THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME FOR THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT TOOLS FOR FOCUS AND

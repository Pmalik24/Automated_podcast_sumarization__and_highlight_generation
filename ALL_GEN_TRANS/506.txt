WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAPO W A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO E  I MAY ENDRHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBOLOGY AND OFF THEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ALL ABOUT ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER OR EGHT H T WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT NORMAL LEVELS OF FOCUS WHAT ARE NORMAL LEVELS OF FOCUS AND HOW ALL OF US WHETHEROR NOT WE HAVE EIGHTY H T OR NOT CAN IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS OUR ABILITY TO RULE OUT DISTRACTION TURNS OUT THOSE AR TWO SEPARATE THINGS AS WELL AS REMEMBER INFORMATION BETTER WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN LEARN TO RELAX WHILE FOCUSING WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF LEARNING NEW INFORMATION AND FOR COMING UP WITH NEW CREATIVE ITEAS SO WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE EIGHTY H T OR NO SOME ONE WHO DOES OR IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO FEELS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE EIGHTY H T BUT WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS OR TO BE MORE CREATIVE THIS EPISODE IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU AS WELL WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DRUG BASED TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF DIET AND SUPPLEMENTATION AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT NEW EMERGING BRAIN MACHINE INTERFASE DEVICES THINGS LIKE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS DON'T WORRY I WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU THESE ARE NON INVASIVE METHODS FOR REWIRING YOUR BRAIN IN ORDER TO MAKE FOCUSING MOR NATURAL FOR YOU AND TO TEACH YOU HOW TO INCREASE YOUR DEPTH OF FOCUS NOW JUST A QUICK REMINDER THAT ANY TIME WE DISCUSS A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER THAT ALL OF US HAVE THE TEMPTATION TO SELF DIAGNOSE OR TO DIAGNOSE OTHERS SO AS I LIST OFF SOME OF THE SYMPTOMOLOGY OF EIGHTY H T SOME OF THAT SYMPTOMOLOGY MIGHT RESIGNATE WITH YOU YOU MIGHT THINK OH MAYBE I HAVE EIGHT H T OR YOU MIGHT DECIDE THAT SOME ONE YOU KNOW DEFINITELY HAS EHTY H T HOWEVER IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T SELF DIAGNOSE OR DIAGNOSE SOMEBODY ELSE THE CLEAR AND REAL DIAGNOSIS OF EIGHT H T REALLY SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT BY A PSYCHIATRIS A PHYSICION OR A VERY WELL TRAIN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST THERE ARE CLEAR CRITERIA FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES FULL BLOWN EIGHT H T HOWEVER MANY OF US HAVE CONSTELLATIONS OF SYMPTOMS THAT MAKE US SOMEWHAT LIKE SOMEBODY WITH EIGHTYH T AND IF YOUR STRUGGLING WITH FOCUS NOW DAYS AS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BECAUSE OF STRESS BECAUSE OF SMART PHON USE WHICH TURNS OUT KIN INDUCE ADULT EIGHTY H T WILL TALK ABOUT THAT WELL THEN PAY ATTENTION TO THE SYMPTOMOLOGY YOU MAY ACTUALLY REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL TREATMENT YOU MIGHT NOT EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS TO REMEMBER THAT SOME OF THE TERMS THAT WE COVER LIKE IMPULSE CONTROL AND ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION ARE SOMEWHAT SUBJECTIVE AND THEY CAN CHANGE OVER TIME SOMETIMES WE HAVE A BETTER LEVEL OF ATTENTION THAN OTHERS MAYBE DEPENDS ON HOW WE SLEPT OR OTHER EVENTS GOING ON IN OUR LIFE ER SOMETHING THAT WEARE ENTIRELY UNAWARE OF THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT WE CAN ALL IMPROVE OUR ATTENTIONAL CAPACITY WE CAN ALL REWIRE THE CIRCUITS THAT MAKE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF FOLKIS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO US WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH MULTIPAL TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS AND WE ARE GOING TO COVER ALL THOSE INTERVENTIONS TO DAY BEFORE WE MARCH INTO THE MATERIAL I'D LIKE TO REMIND THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLTIC GRENS AN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETI GREENS ONCE OR TWICE O DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATE AND OU SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN INVITEMIN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDEVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PATASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES IND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL O THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION ND THAT OU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOCOM SLASH HUBERMENT AND YOU GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHAS THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT  DOK CM SLASH HUBERMN SO LET'S TALK ABOUT EIGHT H T ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT FOCUS AND ATTENTION AND EVERYBODY'S ABILIT TO FOCUS AND ATTEND NOT JUS PEOPLE WITH EIGHT H T WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS THAT WOULD ALLOW ANY ONE WHETHER NOT THEY AVE EIGHTY H T OR NOT TO ENHANCE THEIR LEVEL OF CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS EIGHTY H T USED TO BE CALLED EIGHTHT ATTENTION DEFISITE DISORDER WE HAVE RECORD OF EGHTHT IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE DATING BACK TO AS EARLY AS NINETEEN O FOUR NOW IF'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT NINETEEN O FOUR THAT'S JUST THE FIRST TIME THAT IT SHOWED UP IN THE STANDARD MEDICAL LITERATURE WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT EIGHTHT WHICH WE NOW CALL EIGHTY H T EXISTED BEFORE NINETEEN O FOUR AND PROBABLY LONG BEFORE NINETEEN O FOUR WHY WELL BECAUSE IT HAS A STRONG JUNETIC COMPONENT IF YOU HAVE A CLOSE RELATIVE THAT HAS EGHTY H T THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT YOU WILL HAVE EIGHT H T AND THAT PROBABILITY GOES UP DEPENDING ON HOW CLOSELY RELATED TO THAT PERSON YOU HAPPEN TO BE SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE NIDENTICAL TWIN AND YOUR TWIN HAS EIGHT H T THERE'S A VERY HIGH CONCORDANS AS WE SAY A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY THAT YOU WILL HAVE EIGHTY H T UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT CHANCE IF YOU AVE A FRATERNAL TWIN WITH EIGHTY H T THAT NUMBER GOES DOWN A BIT IN THE FIFTY TO SIXTY PER CENT RANGH AND SO ON IF YOU HAVE APPARENT WITH EIGHTY H T THAT NUMBER RANGES ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WILL HAVE EIGHTY H T IF TWO PARENTS AND SO ON AND SO ON CASE O THERE'S A GNETIC COMPONENT THAT CUNETIC COMPONENT IT TURNS OUT RELATES DIRECTLY TO HOW SPECIFIC NERL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN WIRE UP THE CHEMICALS THEY USE AND THE WAY THEY USE THOSE CHEMICALS A TOPIC THAT WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS IN DEPTH TO DAY NOW IF YOU HAVE A CLOSE RELATIVE WITH EIGHTY H T THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU ARE FADED TO HAVE EIGHTY H T AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE EIGHTY H T THERE ARE WAYS TO OVERCOME THOSE SYMPTOMS OF LACK OF ATTENTION IMPULSIVITY AND SO ON ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT EIGHTY H T IS THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INTELLIGENCE WHETHER OR NOT WERE TALKING ABOUT INTELLIGENCE MEASURED BY A STANDARD ICTEST RATHER CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THEYRE LOTS OF FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE THAT A STANDARDI UTEST JUST WOEN PICK UP EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE MUSICAL INTELLIGENT SPACIAL INTELLIGENCE ALL SORTS OF INTELLIGENCES NONE OF THEM ARE RELATED TO EIGHTY H T BEING VERY HIGH FUNCTIONING DOESN'T MAKE YOU MORE LIKELY TO HAVE EIGHTY H T AND BEING EIGHTY H  DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THATYOU HAVE A LOICU SO THERE AR PEOPLE AT EIGHTY H T HAVE LOWICUS PEOPLE AT EIGHT H T WITH HIH IUS PEOPLE THE TY EHT WITH HIGH EMOTIONAL EYECU OR WITH LOW EYE CU IN THE EMOTIONAL SCALE IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT YOUR ABILITY TO ATTEND AND FOCUS DOES NOT RELATE TO HOW SMART YOU ARE OR YOUR ICU OF ANY TYPE NOT JUST THE STANDARD I CU THE RE NAMING OF EGH D D TO EIGHT EGHT TOOK PLACE IN THE MID TO LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN THE PSYCHIATRIC COMMUNITY AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL COMMUNITY STARTED TAKING BETTER NOTICE OF THE FACT THAT SO CALLED HYPERACTIVE KIDS ALSO HAD ATTENTIONAL ISSUES THIS MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS BUT THERE'S BEEN EXTENSIVE AND ON GOING REVISION OF THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER AND THIS IS STILL AN ON GOING PROCESS EVEN TO DAY SO IN THE MEDAITIES WE START HERING ABOUT EIGHTY EHT AND THEN GRADUALLY THAT TERM EIGHTG T HAS BEEN DROPPED AWAY HOWEVER JUST THE RE NAMING OF EIGHT D TO EIGHTY EGHT HAS LED TO MUCH BETTER DIAGNOSIS AND DETECTION OF EIGHTY HT SRIGHT NOW THE CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT ABOUT ONE IN TEN CHILDREN AND PROBABLY MORE HAVE EIGHT HT THE CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE ANYWHERE FROM TEN PER CENT ONE INTEND TO AS HIGH AS TWELVE PER CENT NOW FORTUNATELY ABOUT HALF OF THOSE WILL RESOLVE WITH PROPER TREATMENT BUT THE OTHER HALF TYPICALLY DON'T THE OTHER THING THAT WE ARE SEEING A LOT NOWADAYS IS INCREASE LEVELS OF EIGHTY T IN ADULTS AND THERE'S SOME QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ADULTS HAD EIGHT GT THAT WHENT UNDETECTED DURING THEIR CHILDHOOD OR WHETHER OR NOT EIGHTY EHT IS NOW CROPPING UP IN ADULTHOOD DUE TO THE WAY THAT WE ARE INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD IN PARTICULAR SMART PHONE USE THE COMBINATION OF EMAL TEXT REAL WORLD INTERACTIONS MULTIBLE APS AND STREAMS OF MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA ALL COMING IN AT ONCE TRING TO MANAGE LIFE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON ARE CREATING A KIND OF CLOUD OF PULLS ON OUR ATTENTION AND SO THERE IS THIS QUESTION TO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE CREATING EIGHT EHT IN ADULTS THAT NEVER HAD EIGHTY HT PRIOR TO BEING AN ADULT SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ATTENTION AND FIRST LEST JUST DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY ATTENTION OUT THERE IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT EIGHTY EHT WE WILL HEAR THINGS LIKE ATTENTION AND FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AND IMPULSE CONTROL FOR SAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION ATTENTION FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING WE COULD SPLIT HAIRS AND THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE DOES SPLIT HAIRS ABOUT THESE BUT IF WE WAN'T UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGY AND WE WANT TO HAVE A STRAIGHTFORWARD CONVERSATION ABOUT EIGHTY EIHT IF I SAY ATTENTION OR FOCUS I'M BASELY REFERRING TO THE SAME THING UNLESS I SPECIFY OTHERWISE K SO PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY T HAVE TROUBLE HOLDING THEIR ATTEN TION WHAT IS ATTENTION WELL ATTENTION IS PERCEPTION IT'S HOW WE ARE PERCEIVING THE CENSORY WORLD SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF NERBALOGY ONE O ONE WE ARE SENSING THINGS ALL THE TIME THERE'S INFORMATION COMING INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM ALL THE TIME FOR INSTANCE RIGHT NOW YOU ARE HURING SOUND WAVES YOU ARE SEEING THINGS YOU ARE SENSING THINGS AGAINST YOUR SKIN BUT YOU ARE ONLY PAYING ATTENTION TO SOME OF THOSE AND THE ONES THAT YOUR PAYING ATTENTION TO ARE YOUR PERCEPTIONS SIF YOU HEAR MY VOICE YOU ARE PERCEIVING MY VOICE YOU ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR OTHER SENSES AT THE MOMENT YOU MIGHT EVN BE OUTSIDE IN A BREEZE AND UNTIL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE PERCEIVING THAT BREEZE BUT YOUR BODY WAS SENSING IT ALL LONG SO ATTENTION IPOCUS ARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME THING BUT IMPULSE CONTROL IS SOMETHING SEPARATE BECAUSE IMPULSE CONTROL REQUIRES PUSHING OUT OR PUTTING THE BLINDERS ON TO CENSORY EVENTS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IT MEANS LACK OF PERCEPTION IMPULSE CONTROL IS ABOUT LIMITING OUR PERCEPTION PEOPLE WITH HTY H T HAVE POOR ATTENTION AND THEY HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF IMPULSIVITY THEY ARE EASILY DISTRACTABLE BUT THE WAY THAT SHOWS UP IS VERY SURPRISING YOU MIGHT THINK THAT PEOPLE WITH HT H T JUST SIMPLY CAN'T ATTEND TO ANYTHING THEY REALLY CAN'T FOCUS EVEN IF THEY REALLY WANT TO BUT THAT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE PEOPLE WITH HT H T YES THEY ARE DISTRACTABLE YES THEY ARE IMPULSIVE YES THEY ARE EASILY ANNOYED BY THINGS HAPPENING IN THE ROOM THEY SOMETIMES HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF EMOTIONALITY AS WELL NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN HOWEVER PEOPLE WITH HT H T CAN HAVE A HYPER FOCUS AND INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO FOCUS ON THINGS THAT THEY REALLY ENJOY OR ENARE INTRIGUED BY NOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE TYPICALLY WE THINK OF SOMEBODY WITH HT H  AS BEING REALLY WILD AND HYPER ACTIVE OR HAVING NO ABILITY WHATSOEVER TO SIT STILL AND ATTEND AND WHILE THAT FINATYPE AS WE CALL IT THAT CONTOUR OF BEHAVIOR AND COGNITION CAN EXIST MANY PEOPLE IF NOT ALL PEOPLE WITH HT H T IF YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING THEY REALLY LOVE LIKE F THE CHILD LOVES VIDIO GAMES OR IF A CHILD LOVES TO DRAW OR IF TH ADULT LOVES A PARTICULAR TYPE OF MOVY OR A PERSON VERY MUCH THEY WILL OBTAIN LAZER FOCUS WITHOUT ANY EFFORT SO THAT TELLS US THAT PEOPLE WITH T H T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ATTEND BUT THEY CAN'T ENGAGE THAT ATTENTION FOR THINGS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY REALLY WANT TO DO AND AS WE ALL KNOW MUCH OF LIFE WHETHER NOT YOUR CHILD OR AN ADULT INVOLVES DOING A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO MUCH OF OUR SCHOOLING OF OLVES DOING THINGS THAT WE WOULD PREFER NOT TO DO AND SORT OF FORCING OURSELVES TO DO IT TO ATTEND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT SUPERINTERESTED IN WHAT WE ARE ATTENDING TO THERE ARE COUPLE OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE TH EGHTY H T DISPLAY QUITE OFTEN ONE IS CHALLENGES WITH TIME PERCEPTION TIME PERCEPTION IS A FASCINATING ASPECT OF HOW OUR BRAIN WORKS AND LATER WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TIME PERCEPTION AND HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET BETTER AT TIME PERCEPTION 'S VERY LIKELY THAT RIGHT NOW YOU ARE DOING THINGS THAT GET IN THE WAY OF OPTABLE TIME PERCEPTION AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO A JUST YOUR ABILITY TO MEASURE TIME WITH YOUR BRAIN PEOPL WITH AGHTY H T OFTEN RUN LATE THEY OFTEN PRECASTINATE BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING AND SURPRISING IS THAT IF THEY ARE GIVEN A DEAD LINE THEY ACTUALLY CAN PERCEIVE TIME VERY WELL AND THEY OFTEN CAN FOCUS VERY WELL IF THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT COMPLETING A TASK OR NOT ATTENDING ARE SEVERE ENOUGH LO BIT LIKE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WITH EGHTY H T CAN REALLY FOCUS IF THEY LIKE SOMETHING WELL IF THEIRE SCARED ENOUGH ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT ATTENDING OFTENTIMES NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTENTIMES THEY CAN ATTEND IF THEY'RE NOT REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT A DEAD LINE OR CONSEQUENCE WELL THEN THEY TEND TO LOSE TRACK OF TIME AND THEY TEND TO UNDER ESTIMATE HOW LONG THINGS WILL TAKE NOW MANY PEOPLE DO THAT NOT JUST PEOPLE WITH AGHT H T BUT PEOPLE WITH EHT H T HAVE CHALLENGES UNDERSTANDING HOW TO LINE UP THE ACTIVITIES OF THEIR DAY IN ORDER TO MEET PARTICULAR DEAD LINES EVEN IF IT'S JUST A SIMPLE THING LIKE FINISHING ONE SET OF TASKS BEFORE LUNCH OFTENTIMES THEY WILL REMEMBER THAT LUNCH STARTS AT NOON BUT SOMEHOW THEY AREN'T ABLE TO FILL THE INTERVENING TIME IN A WAY THAT'S PRODUCTIVE AND THEY CAN OBSESS ABOUT THE UPCOMING DEAD LINE FOR INSTANCE WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO REMEDY THIS IN ADDITION THEY'RE SPACIAL ORGANIZATION SKILLS ARE OFTEN AN SUBPAR NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN YOU WILL FIND THAT SOMEBODY WITH EHTY H T USES WHAT'S CALLE THE PILE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ORGANIZE THINGS THEY WILL TAKE MANY BELONGINGS IN THIS COULD BE IN THE KITCHEN OR IN THEIR BEDROOM OR IN THEIR OFFICE OR IN ANY SPACE AND THEY WILL START PILING THINGS UP ACCORDING TO A CATEGORIZATION SYSTEM THAT MAKE SENSE TO THEM AND ONLY THEM IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY LOGICAL FRAME WORK NW MANY PEOPLE USE THE PILE SYSTEM AND IF USE THE PILE SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE EHTY H T IN FACT IF YOU'RE UNPACKING A HOUSE OR YOU'VE MOVED RECENTLY OR YOU'VE RECEIVED A LOT OF PRESENTS RECENTLY THE PILE SYSTEM MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ORGANIZE YOUR SPACE BUT PEOPLE WITH GHTY H T TEND TO ORGANIZE THINGS ACCORDING TO THE PILE SYSTEM ALL THE TIME AND THAT PILE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM CASE SO THAT'S THE KEY DISTINCTION THAT THEY USE A FILING SYSTEM AND ITS NOT REALLY FILES THEATR PILING THINGS UP IN A WAY THAT MAKE SENSE TO THEM BUT THEN IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM IN TERMS OF WHAT TASK THEY ACTUALLY NEED TO PERFORM THEY CAN'T FIND THINGS OR IF ANY ONE MOVES ONE THING THAT IT IT'S VERY DESRUPTIVE TO THEIR OVERALL PLAN BECAUSE THEIRE OVERALL PLAN DOESN'T REALLY WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT'S A COMMON FENA T PE AS WE CALL IT A FIANTYPE BY THE WAY IS JUST AN EXPRESSION OF A PARTICULAR SET OF UNDERLINE CENETIC OR PSYCHOLOGICA COMPONENTS OCHIS WE SEE THE FINOTYPE SO I FIANTYPE CO BE BROWN HAIR AND NOG GREEN EYES LIKE FOR ME A FINATYPE COULD ALSO BE THAT SOMEBODY USES THE PILING SYSTEM OK THE OTHER THING THAT PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY EIGHT SHE HAVE REAL TROUBLE WITH IS SO CALLED WORKING MEMORY NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THAT PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY EIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE REALLY POOR MEMORIES BUT IN FACT THAT'S NOT THE CASE PEOPLE WIH EIGHTY EIGH STE OFTEN CAN HAVE A TERRIFIC MEMORY FOR PAST EVENTS THEY CAN REMEMBER UPCOMING EVENTS QUITE WELL THEIR MEMORY IS CLEARLY WORKING HOWEVER ONE ASPECT OF MEMORY IN PARTICULAR THAT WE CALL WORKING MEMORY IS OFTEN DISTERRUPTED WORKING MEMORY IS THE ABILITY TO KEEP SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON LINE TO RECYCLEIT IN YOUR BRAIN OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO THAT YOU CAN USE IT IN THE IMMEDIATE OR SHORT TERM A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE YOU MEET SOMEBODY THEY TELL YOU THEIR NAME THEY GIVE EITHER PHONE NUMBER VERBALLY AND YOU HAVE TO WALK BACK TO YOUR PHONE AND ENTER IT INTO YOUR PHONE PEOPLE WITHOUT EIGHTY EIGHT MIGHT HAVE TO PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT IT MIGHT FEEL LIKE A BIT OF A STRUGGLE BUT TYPICALLY THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO RECITE THAT FOE NUMBER IN THEIR MIND OVER AND OVER THEN PUT IN TO THEIR PHONE PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY EGH SH TEND TO LOSE THE ABILITY OR LACK THE ABILITY TO REMEMBER THINGS THAT THEY JUST NEED TO KEEP ON LINE FOR ANYWHERE FROM TEN SECONDS TO A MINUTE OR TWO OCHI SO A STRING OF NUMBERS LIKE SIX FOR THREE SEVENT Y ONE FOR MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE PRETTY EASY SIX FOR THREE SEVEN EIGHT ONE SIX OR THREE SEVENTEIT ONE YOU COULD PROBABLY REMEMBER THAT A MINUTE FROM NOW WITHOUT WRITING IT DOWN BUT IF YOU ADD ONE MORE NUMBER TO THAT SIXFOR THREE SEVENT EIGHT ONE THREE IT GETS TOUGHER OCESO THERE'S A REASON WHY PHONE NUMBERS TYPICALLY HAVE SEVEN DIGITS IN THEM OF COURSE ERS AN AREA CODE BUT REMEMBERING INFORMATION THAT STRINGS OUT LONGER THAN SEVEN NUMBERS OR A SENTENCE OR TO THAT'S CHALLENGING FOR MOST PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY EIGHT SHE HAVE SEVERE CHALLENGES EVEN WITH MUCH SMALLER BATCHES OF INFORMATION OVER EVEN MUCH SMALLER BATCHES OF TIME DEFISITS IN WORKING MEMERY ARE ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE SEE IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE FRONT A TEMPORAL TO DOMENTHAS O DAMAGE TO THE FRONTOF LOBES OR EGE RELATED COGNAVE TO CLIME AND AND SO IT WILL COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT LATER WHEN WE DISCUSS TREATMENTS SUPPLEMENTS AND OTHER TOOLS FOR EIGHTY EIGH T THAT MANY OF THOSE TREATMENTS SUPPLEMENTS AND TOOLS FOR EIGHTY EIGH T ARE SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT WORK FOR EHE RELATED COGNAVE TO CLIME OKASO WEVE MORE OR LESS ESTABLISH THE COND OF MANU OF ITEMS THAT PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY EIGHT T TEN TO HAVE SOME HAVE ALL OF THEM SOME HAVE JUST A SUBSET OF THEM THEIR SEVERITY CAN RANGE FROM VERY INTENTS TO MILD BUT IN GENERAL IT'S CHALLENGES WITH ATTENTION AND FOCUS CHALLENGES WITH IMPULSE CONTROL THEY GET ANNOYED EASILY IF COND OF AN IMPULSIVITY THET CANTST Y ON TASK TIME PERCEPTION CAN BE OFF THEY USE THE PILING SYSTEM OR SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T WORK WELL FOR THEM IN ORDER TO ORGANIZE THEIR THINGS IN PHYSICAL SPACE AND THEY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH ANYTHING THAT'S MUNDANE THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN BUT AGAIN I JUST WANT A HIGHLIT THAT PEOPLE WITH EIGHTYA ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF FOCUS EVEN HYPER FOCUS FOR THINGS THAT ARE ECITING TO THEM AND THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO ENGAGE IN SONAYA HAVE THE CONTOUR OF WHAT EGHTY T IS AND IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T AVE EGHTYT YOU SHOULD ALSO BE OSKING YOURSELF WHICH ASPECTS OF GHTD T ARE SIMILAR TO THINGS HAVE EXPERIENCE BEFORE BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE HEALTHY BRAIN IS THAT THERE'S ALSO ARRANGE OF ABILITIES TO FOCUS SOME PEOPLE FOCUS VERY WELL ON ANY TASK YE GIVE THEM A TAS THEY CAN JUST LAZORIN ON THAT TASK OTHER PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO AN FIGHT AN INTERNAL BATTLE THEY HAVE THEY CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT IT'S IMPORTANT ARE INTERESTING THEYIF TO AAVE BINCENTIVIZE THEMSELVES INTERNALLY OTHER PEOPLE DOESN'T MATTER THEY COUNLD BE BORED TO TEARS WITH THE INFORMATION BUT THEY CONDO IT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE QUOTE ND QUOTE VERY DISCIPLINE PEOPLE WE TEND TO ADMIRE THOSE PEOPLE BUT AS YOU'LL SEE ALOBIT LATOR IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO RUN YOUR ATTENTIONAL SYSTEM THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THIS BUSINESS OF HAVING HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ATTENTION FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE MOST INTERESTED ARE EXCITED BY SO LET'S DRILL INTO THIS ISSUE OF WHY PEOPLE WITH EGHTY AT ACTUALLY CAN FOCUS VERY INTENSELY ON THINGS THAT THEY ENJOY AND ARE CURIOUS ABOUT NOW ENJOYMENT AND CURIOSITY OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS THEY ARE NOT EVEN REALLY PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS THEY'RE JUST THE WAY THAT WE DESCRIBE OUR HUMAN EXPERIENCE OF LIKING THINGS WANTING TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM BUT FROM A NEUROBIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE THEY HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDENTITY AND SIGNATURE AND THAT'S DOPAMIE DOPAMNE IS RELEASED FROM NEURONS IT'S WHAT WE CALL A NEUROMODULATOR AND AS A NEUROMODULATOR IT CHANGES THE ACTIVITY OF THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN SUCH THAT CERTAIN CIRCUTS ARE MORE ACTIVE THAN OTHERS AND IN PARTICULAR DOPAMINE CREATES A HEIGHTENED STATE OF FOCUS IT TENDS TO CONTRACT OUR VISUAL WORLD AND IT TENDS TO MAKE US PAY ATTENTION TO THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE AND BEYOND THE CONFINES OF OUR SKIN ITS WHAT WE CALL EXTEROCEPTION DOPAMINE ALSO TENDS TO PUT US IN A STATE OF MOTIVATION AND WANTING THINGS OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF OUR SKIN SO WHETHER NOT WERE PURSUING SOMETHING PHYSICAL IN OUR WORLD OR WHETHER NOT WERE PURSUING INFORMATION IN OUR OUTSIDE WORLD DOPAMINE IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ABILITY AND ORE DRIVE TO DO THAT BUT DOPAMINE AS A NEUROMODULATOR IS ALSO INVOLVED IN CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE PERCEIVE THE WORLD SO AS I MENTIONED EARLY OR YOU HAVE ALL THESE SENSES COMING IN AND YOU CAN ONLY PURCEIVE SOME OF THEM BECAUSE YOUR ONLY PAYN ATTENTI IN TO SOME OF THEM DOPAMINE WHEN IT'S RELEASED IN OUR BRAIN TENDS TO TURN ON AREAS OF OUR BRAIN THAT NARROW OUR VISUAL FOCUS AND OUR AUDITORY FOCUS SO IT CREATES A TONE OF AUDITORY ATTENTION THAT'S VERY NARROW  CREATES A TUNNAL OF VISUAL ATTENTION THAT'S VERY NARROW WHEREAS WHEN WE HAVE LESS DOPOMINE WE TEND TO VIEW THE ENTIRE WORLD WE TEND TO SEE THE WHOLE SCENE THAT WE ARE IN WE TEND TO HEAR EVERYTHING ALL AT ONTE SO AS I DESCRIBE THIS WHOLEFULY YOU'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND HOW HAVING DOPAMING RELEASE CAN ALLOW A PERSON WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE EIGHTYAE TO YOUR NOT TO DIRECT THEIR ATTENTION TO PARTICULAR THINGS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT RIGHT SO NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM ATTENTION AS THIS KIND OF VAGUE AMBIGUOUS TERM AND WE'RE GIVING IT A NEURO CHEMICAL IDENTITY DOPAMIE AND WE ARE GIVING IT A NEURAL CIRCUIT IDENTITY AND JUST TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF FLAVOR AND DETAIL ON WHICH NEURAL CIRCUITS THOSE ARE I WANT TO DISCUSS TWO GENERAL TYPES OF NEURAL CIRCUITS THAT DOAMINE TENDS TO ENHANCS SO LET'S TALK NEURAL CIRCUITS AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT LOVE HEARING NEURA SCIENCE NOMIN CLATURE YOU'RE GOING TOTO EAT THIS PART UP AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T LIKE A LOT OF NAMES OF BRAIN AREAS I INVITE YOU TO TUN OUT OR JUST TRY AND GRAB THE TOP CONTOUR OF THIS I WILL DESCRIBE IT IN PRETTY GENERAL TERMS BUT I WILL GIVE SOME DETAIL BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE SOME OF YOU OUT THERE WHO REALLY WANT TO DEGDEEPER INTO WHAT THE EXACT STRUCTURES AND CONUCTIVITIES ARE OK SO THEI'RE TWO MAIN TYPES OF CIRCUITS THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO EIGHTY H T ATTENTION IN DOPAMI THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IS THE NETWORK OF BRAIN AREAS IN YOUR BRAIN IN MY BRAIN AND IN EVERYBODY'S BRAIN THAT IS ACTIVE WHEN WEARE NOT DOING ANYTHING WHEN WE'RE JUST SITTING THERE IDLE AT REST NOWIT'S VERY HARD TO NOT THINK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT WHEN YOUARE NOT ENGAGE IN ANY TYPE OF SPECIFIC TASK SO YOU'RE NOT DRIVEING YOU'RE NOT PLAYING O VIDIO GAME YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO STUDY RE NOT TRYING TO LISTEN YO'E JUST SITTING THERE LETTING YOUR BRAIN CONE GO WHEREVER IT WANTS TO GO YOU'RE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK UNDERLIES THAT STATE OF MIND THE OTHER SET OF CIRCUITS THAT WE'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO EGHTY H T OR THE TASK NETWORKS THE NETWORKS OF THE BRAIN THAT MAKE YOU GOAL ORIENTED OR THAT AR AT LEAST TRYING TO MAKE YOU GOAL ORIENTED AND THOSE ARE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SET OF BRAIN AREAS HOWEVER THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AND THESE TASK NETWORKS OR COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THEY'RE DOING THAT IN VERY INTERESTING WAYS SO FIRST I WANT TO DESCRIBE HOW THESE TWO SETS OF BRAIN AREAS THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AND THE TASK NET WORKS NORMALLY INTERACT OK SO LITTLA BIT OF NAMING HERE AGAIN FEEL FREE TO IGNORE IT IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL BUT THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK INCLUDES AN AREA CALLED THE DORSYLATERAL PREFRONTAL C RTEX FRONTAL QUARTECS NO SURPRISES IN THE FRONT AND YOU HAVE A DORSAL THE TOP AND SIDE LATERAL PART DORSYLATERAL PREFRONTAL QUARTE YET ONE ON EACH SIDOUR BRAIN  AND THEN YOU HAVE A BRAIN ARY CALED THE POSTERIOR SINGULATE QUARTEX AND THEN YOU HAVE AN AREA CALLED THE LATERAL PRIDOL LOPE AGAIN YOU DON'T NEED REMEMBER THESE NAMES FOR THESE ARE THREE BRAIN AREAS THAT NORMALLY ARE SYNCRONIZED IN THEIR ACTIVITY SO WHEN ONE OF THESE AREAS IS ACTIVE IN A TYPICAL PERSON THE OTHER AIRS WOULD BE ACTIVE AS WELL IT'SA LOBIT LIKE A SYMPHONY OR A BAND LIKE A THREE PIECE BAND IS LIKE DRUMS GUITAR AND BASE ARE PLAYING TOGETHER K THAT'S HOW IT IST IN A TYPICAL PERSON AND A PERSON WITH EGHTY H T OR EVEN A PERSON WHO HAS SUBCLINICAL ATY H T OR IN ANY HUMAN BEING WHO HASN'T SLEPT WELL WHAT YOU FIND IS THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IS NOT SYNCRONIZED THESE BRAINARIES ARE JUST NOT PLAYING WELL TOGETHER NOW THE TASK NET WORKS INCLUDE A DIFFERENT SET OF STRUCTURES IT STILL INVOLVES THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT PART OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX K TENDS TO BE THE MEDIOL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND THERE'RE SOME OTHER BRAIN AREAS THAT THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS COMMUNICATING TO ALL THE TIME MAINLY TO SUPPRESS IMPULSES IT'S SHUTTING DOWN THE DESIRE TO STAND UP OR TO SCRATCH THE SIDE OF YOUR CHEK OR YOUR NOSE IF YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO DO THAT ANY TIME YOU'RE RESTRICTING YOUR BEHAVIOR THESE TASK DIRECTED NETWORKS ARE VERY ACTIVE K NOW NORMALLY IN A PERSON WITHOUT EHTY H T THE TASK NET WORKS AND THE DEFAULT MODE NET WORKS ARE GOING IN CONA CSAW FASHION THEY ARE ACTUALLY WHAT WE CALL ANTI CORRELATED SO IT'S NOT JIOUS THAT THEY ARE NOT CORRELATED THEY ARE ACTUALLY OPPOSING ONE ANOTHER THEY ARE ANTI CORRELATED IN A PERSON WITH EIGHTY H T THE DEFAULT MODE NET WORKS AND THE TASK NETWORKS ARE ACTUALLY MORE CORDINATED THAT MIGHT COME AS SUPPRISING I THINK THAT WE ALL HAVE THIS TENDENC TO KIND OF JUMP TO CONCLUSION AND ASSUME THAT SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE AN EASY TIME PAYING ATTENTION OR HAS HT H T THAT THEIR BRAIN MUST BE COMPLETELY IN COHERENT THAT THIT'S NOT WORKING WELL AND BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S OUT OF WACK BUT THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING ABOUT PEOPLE WITH EGHTY H T WHEREBY THE TASK NET WORKS AND THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORKS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT'S CORRELATED AND THAT IS WHAT'S ABNORMAL SO THIS WOULD BE LIKE THE GUITAR BASE IN THE DRUMS PLAYING TOGETHER IN A WAY WHERE THE BASE IS IN KEEPING THE BACK BAD AND THE DRUMS AREN'T KEEPING THE BACK B THAT THE'RE PLAYING TOGETHER THATE ALL PLAYING THE MELODIES IN HARMONIES IN A WAY THAT JUST DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BRAIN OF SOMEBODY WITH EHTY H T AND WE CAN NOW CONFIDENTLY SAY BASED ON BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES THAT WHEN SOMEBODY GETS BETTER WHEN THEY'RE TREATED FORADY H T OR WHEN THE GE OUT OF DY H T AS SOMETIMES SINCE THE CASE THAT THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORKS AND THE TASK NETWORKS TEN TO BECOME ANTICORRELATED AGAIN KSO THAT'S THE UNDERLYING NORAL BIOLOGY BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT I DIDN'T MENTION DOPAMINE AT ALL WHAT DOPAMINE IS DOING IN THIS CONTAXT IS DOPAMINE IS ACTING LIKE A CONDUCTOR DOPAMINE IS SAYING THIS CIRCUIT SHOULD BE ACTIVE THAN THAT CIRCUIT SHOULD BE ACTIVE IT SHOULD BE DEFALTMO NETWORK AND THEN WHEN THE DEFALT MO NETWORK IS NOT ACTIVE THEN IT SHOULD BE THE TASINET WORK SO IT'S REALLY ACTING AS THE CONDUCTOR SAN OUGO NOW YOUGO NOW YOUGO NOW YOUGO AND IN EIGHTY  T THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM THAT IS NOT ALLOWING IT TO CONDUCT THESE NETWORKS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY WHAT YOU KNOW THE ENGINEERS OR PHYSICISTS ARE MATHEMATICIANS WHICH THEY OUT OF PAS TO BE ANTI CORRELATED K ADIFAS AND ANTIQUOELATE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING AT LEAST FOR PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION SO THAT RAISES TWO QUESTIONS COULD IT BE THAT DOPAMINE IS NOT AT SUFFICIENTLY HIGH LEVELS OR COULD IT BE THET DOPAMINE IS JUST DOING IT ALL WRONG IN OTHER WORDS IS THERE NO CONDUCTOR OR IS THE CONDUCTOR PLAYING WITH LAY LITTLE TINING TOOTHBICS AND SO THE INSTRUMENTS CAN'T SEE WHAT THE'R SUPPOSE TO DO THEY CAN'T GET THE INSTRUCTION CAUSE IT'S JUST NOT LOUD ENOUGH SO TO SPEAK OR COULD IT BE THAT THE INFORMATION IS GETTING OUT BUT THE INFORMATION THAT'S GETTING OUT IS WRONG THE CONDUCTORS THERE BUT THE CONDUCTOR IS IN VERY GOOD AT CONDUCTING NOW WE CAN GAIN INSIGHT INTO HOW THIS SYSTEM WORKS AND FAILS AND HOW TO TREAT IT BY LOOKING AT SOME OF THE CURRENT AND PREVIOUS TREATMENTS FOR EIGHTY H T AS WELL AS SOME OF THE RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY H T TEND TO PURSUE AND LIKE NOW CERTAINLY NOT A PROPONENT OF PEOPLE ITH EHTY H T TAKING DRUG'S RECREATIONALLY THAT'S NOT WHA THIS IS ABOUT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND YOU COUPLE THAT DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIOR TO THEIR DESIRE TO REMEDY THEIR ATTENTION DEFISIT YOU START GAITING SOME REALLY INTERESTING INSIGHT INTO HOW DOPAMINE IS REGULATING THESE CIRCUITS IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN PEOPLE WITH T H T SO WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON WITH THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN PEOPLE WITH HTY H T AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN PEOPLE THAT HAVE TERRIFIC LEVELS OF ATTENTION FOR ANY TASK WELL IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND IMPORTANT PAPER CAME OUT THE FIRST AUTHOR SPENSER ND IT CAME OUT IN A JOURNAL CALLED BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIETRY AND IT FORMALIZED THE SO CALLED LOW DOPAMINE HYPOTHESIS OF GHTY H T THE IDEA THAT DOPAMNE WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED OR NOT AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS IN PEOPLE WITH EGHTY  HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR PRETTY LONG TIME BUT A FORMAL PROPOSITION OF THE LODOPAMINE HYPOTHESIS LED TO SOME REALLY IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTS AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT GOES WRONG IN GT H T IT TURNS OUT THAT IF DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE TOO LOW IN PARTICULAR CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT IT LEADS TO UNNECESSARY FIRING OF NURONS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE TASK THAT ONE IS TRYING TO DO AND THAT IS UNRELATED TO THE INFORMATION THAT ONE IS TRYING TO FOCUS ON SO YOU INK BACK BEFORE YOU'VE GOT THIS DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AND A TASK RELATED NETWORK AND THEY NEED TO BE IN THIS KIND OF CONCERT OF ANTICORRELATION AND IN EIGHTY HTEITHER FIRING TOGETHER WELL THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE THAT WHEN DOPAMING IS LOW CERTAIN NURONS ARE FIRING WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T BE THIS IS LIKE A BAND RIGHT WILL GO BACK TO OUR BAND THATS A GUITAR ABASIN AND PERSON PLAING THE DRUMS AND ITS AS IF ONE OF THOSE OR SEVERAL OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE PLAYING NOTES WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T BE PLAYING MIGHT THE PAUSES IN MUSIC ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE ACTUAL PLAYING OF NOTES WHEN DOPAMING IS TOO LOW NURONS FIRE MORE THAN THEY SHOULD IN THESE NETWORKS THAT GOVERN ATTENTION THIS IS THE SO CALLED LO DOPAMING HYPOTHESIS AND IF YOU START LOOKING ANECDOTALY AT WHAT PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY H T HAVE DONE FOR DECADES NOT JUST RECENTLY SINCE THE LO DOPAMING HYPOTHESISIS BEEN PROPOSE BUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THEN THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THEY TEND TO USE RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR THEY TEND TO INDULGE IN NON DRUG STIMULANTS SO THINGS LIKE DRINKING SIX CUPS OF COFFEE OR QUADRUPLOUS PRESSOS OR WHEN IT WAS MORE PROMINENT SMOKING A HALF A PACK A CIGARETTES AND DRINKING FOR CUPS OF COFFEE A DAY OR IF THE PERSON HAD ACCESS TO IT USING COCANE IS A RECREATIONAL DRUG OR EMPHEDAMING IS A RECREATIONAL DRUG ALL OF THOSE SUBSTANCES THAT I JUST DESCRIBED IN PARTICULAR COCANE AND AMPHEDAMINE BUT ALSO COFFEE AND CIGARETTES INCREASE LEVELS OF MULTIPLE NERVE TRANSMITTERS BUT ALL HAVE THE QUALITY OF INCREASING LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IN THE BRAIN AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE REGIONS OF THE BRAIN THAT REGULATE ATTENTION AND THESE TASK RELATED AND DEFAULT MODE NETWORKS NOW YOUNG CHILDREN FORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE KINDS OF STIMULANTS MOST OF THE TIME AND THOSE STIMULANTS ALL HAVE HYGH POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE IN ADULTS SO WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE IN A FEW MINUTES BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CHILDREN EVEN VERY YOUNG CHILDREN WITH EIHTY  T THEY SHOW THINGS LIKE PREFERENCE FOR SUGARY FOODS WHICH ALSO ACT AS DOPAMING INDUCING STIMULANTS OF COURSE ONCE THEY GET ACCESS TO SODOPOP AND COFFEE AND T THEY START TO INDULGE IN THOSE MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME HAS THOUGHT THAT CHILDREN WITH EIGHTY H TO CONSUME TOO MANY SUGARY FOODS ARE DRANK TOO MUCH SODA OR ADULTS WITH EIGHTY H T WOULD TAKE RECREATIONAL DRUGS LIKE METHEMPHEDEMING EIR COCANE OR WOULD DRINK COFFEE TO ACCESS ARE SMOKE CIGARETTES TO ACCESS BECAUSE THEY HAD POOR LEVELS OF ATTENTION AND BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T MAKE GOOD DECISIONS THEY WERE TOO IMPULSIVE AND SO FORTH AND WHILE THAT CERTAINLY COULD BE THE CASE KNOWING WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT DOPAMINE AND THE FACT THAT HAVING ENOUGH DOPE MEAN IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO CORDINATE THESE NARL CIRCUITS THAT ALLOW FOR FOCUS AND QUALITY DECISION MAKING AN EQUALLY VALID IDEA IS THAT THESE CHILDREN AND THESE ADULTS ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO SELF MEDICATE BY PURSUING THESE COMPOUNDS MIGHT THINGS LIKE COQUENE LEAD TO HUGE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE WELL WHAT HAPPENS WITH WHEN SOMEBODY WITH EIHTY HT TAKES THAT DRUG IT TURNS OUT THEY ACTUALLY OBTAIN HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF FOCUS THERE A BILITY TO FOCUS ON THINGS OTHER THAN THINGS THEY ABSOLUTELY CARE INTENSELY ABOUT GOES UP LIKEWISE CHILDREN WHO CONSUME ANYTHING THAT INCREASES THEIR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IF THOSE CHILDREN HAVE EIGHTY T THEY TEND TO BE CALMER THEY TEND TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS MORE NOW THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAND CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE EIGHTY EGHT WHEN THEY CONSUME TOO MUCH SUGAR THEY TEND TO BECOME SUPERHYPERACTIVE WHEN THEY CONSUME ANY KIND OF STIMULANT THEY TEND TO GO WILD AND RUN AROUND LIKE CRAZY I SHOULD AVE AN ANECDOTE ABOUT THIS JUST TO ILLUSTRATED I HAVE A FRIEND HE HAS TWO CHILDREN THAT ARE NOW IN THEIR TEENS AND TWENTIES BUT WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE WHEN TIME I BROUGHT THEM SOME CHOCOLATE JUST AS A GIFT WHEN I SHOWED UP AT THEIR HOUSE AND WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES WTHE KIDS WERE RUNNING AROUND LIKE CRAZY I MAYNIT THEY WERE PRETTY HIGH ENERGY KIDS BUT THEY WERE GOING BONKERS AND THAT'S I SUALLY WHEN THE MOTHER MY FRIEND AT THE TIME AN FORTUNAELY STILL NOW LOOKED AT THE CHOCOLANE REALIZE THAT IT WAS CHOCOLATE WITH ESPRESOBINES IN IT IT WAS LIKE DARCHOCOLATES RESOBINE SO I I WAS REALLY AT FAULT THERE YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE KIDS DARCHOCOLATE WITH THE SPRESOBINES BUT WHAT YOUE REALLY SEEING THAT HYPERACTIVITY THAT IS DOPAMINE ONK IT'S THE CHILDRERR COMBINED WITH THE KAFINE IN THIS CASE COMBINED WITH A FEW OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT EXIST IN CHOCOLATE THAT REALLY INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS AND OUR TENEZY TO WANT TO MOVE AROUND A LOT OK SO DOPAMINE AND LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMINE APPARENTLY ARE WHAT'S WRONG IN PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY T THAT DOPAMING HYPOTHESIS IS WHAT LED TO THE IDEA THAT TREATING PEOPLE CHILDREN AND ADULTS INCLUDED WITH DOPAMAN URGENT COMPOUNDS WOULD SOMEHOW INCREASE THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAJOR DRUGS THAT WERE DEVELOPED AND NOW MARKETED BY FARMASUITICAL COMPANIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY T THOSE DRUGS HAVE NAMES LIKE RIDDLAN NOWADAYS ITS TYPICALLY THINGS LIKE ADARAL MODAPHANIL AND SOME OF THE OTHER DERIVATIVES THEY ALL SERVE TO INCREASE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IN PARTICULAR DOPAMINE IN THE NETWORKS THAT CONTROL TASK DIRECTED BEHAVIOR AND THAT CORDINATE THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AND THESE TASK RELATED NETWORKS SO MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF RIDDLIN RIDDLIN IS A PERSCRIPTION STIMULANT THAT IS PROSCRIBED FOR EIGHTY HTE AS WELL AS FOR NARCOLEPSY NARCOLEPSY IS A CONDITION WHICH PEOPLE TEND TO FALL ASLEEP DURING THE DAY TIME QUITE A LOTS EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS NOT DUE TO LACK OF SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT ALSO TEND TO FALLS ASLEEP WHEN THEY GET EXCITED IF THEIR REALLY EMOTIONALLY EXCITED OR ABOUT TO EAT OR ANY OTHER KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT WOULD NORMALLY GET SOMEBODY REALLY AROUSED AND ALERT PEOPLE OIF NARCALAPSY TEND TO FALL ASLEEP OR THEY TEND TO BECOME WHAT'S CALLED CATAPLACTIC THEY TEND TO  SORT OF GO LIMP IN THE MUSCLES SO IT'S THIS INVASION OF SLEEP INTO THE DAYTIME ITS DISREGULATED BY EMOTION YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY A STIMULANT SOMETHING THAT WOULD WAKE YOU UP MAK YOU VERY ALERT FOCUSED AND MOTIVATED WOULD BE A GOOD TREATMENT FOR NARCALAPSY ADARALL ALSO IS USED TO TREAT EIGHTY T AND TO TREAT NARCALAPSY THINGS LIKE MODAPHENIL ALSO USED TO TREAT EIGHTY T AND NARCALAPSY SO YOURE SENSING A THENE HERE SO WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE DRUGS AND WHAT CAN THAT TELL US ABOUT EIGHTY T WELL RIDDLN WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GENERATION DRUGS THAT WAS PRESCRIBE FOR ADY T IN ORDER TO DEEL HEAD ON WITH THIS DOPENING HYPOTHESIS THIS IDEA THAT INNADY T DOPENING LEVELS ARE TOO LOW NOWADAYS ADARALL IS THE MORE TYPICALLY PRESCRIBED DRUG FOR EIGHTY T THAT HAS TO DO WITH SOME OF THE SO CALLED PARMO CANETICS THE RATE AT WHICH THOSE DRUGS ENTER THE SYSTEM AND HOW LONG THEY LAST IN THE SYSTEM SO FOR INSTANCE RIDDLAN WAS A DRUG THAT WAS PACKAGE INTO VARIOUS TIME RELEASE FORMULAS WERE AS INITIALLY ADARALL WAS ONLY RELEASED IN A FORM THAT HAD A VERY SHORT LIFE SO A MEANING THAT IT WASN'T IN THE BLOODSTREAM VERY LONG AND DIDN'T EFFECT THE BRAIN FOR VERY LONG AND SO THE DOSAGES COULD BE CONTROLLED IN A MORE TYPICAL WAY WITHOUT GOING INTO A LOT OF A TENGENTIAL DETAIL AS YOU ALL KNOW AT DIFERENT TIMES OF DAY YOU TEND TO BE MORE OR LESS ALERT SO A LONG SUSTAINED RELEASE DRUG WHILE THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE A REALLY TERRIFIC THING IF THAT DRUG IS HAVING AN EFFECT OF MAKING YOU MORE ALERT AND ITS RELEASED A CROSS VERY MANY HOURS OF YOUR DAY THERE MIGHT BE PERIODS OF YOUR DAY WHEN YOU FEEL TOO ALERT PERIODS OF YOUR DAY WHEN YOU FEEL JUST RIGHT AND PERIODS OF YO DAY WHEN YOU WISHED THAT YOU WERE MORE ALERT THESE ARE SOME OF THE PHARMICA CANEICS CANATICS MEAN MOVEMENT OF THE DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS WITHIN THE BLOOD STREAM AND BRAIN THAT COULD YOU COULD IMAGINE IN A VERY REAL WAY WOULD IMPACT WHETHER NOT SOME ONE WOULD FEEL REALLY GOOD ON ONE OF THESE DRUGS OR WHETHER NOT THEY WOULD FEEL TOO ANXIOUS OR TOO SLEEPY AND SO ON LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK FOR SECOND AND JUST ASK WHAT ARE THESE DRUGS WE KNOW THEY INCREASE DOPOMINE BUT WHAT ARE THEY REALLY WELL RIDDLAN ALSO CALLED METALPHENIDATE IS VERY SIMILAR TO MPHEDAMI SPEED OR WHAT TYPICALLY CALL SPEED IN THE STREET DRUG A NOMING CLATUR ADARALL WHICH GOES BY VARIOUS OTHER NAMES OK SO ADARALL AARALL EX ARE MYT  MY DAS MY DIASIS A THINGS LIKE THAT ADARALL IS BASELY A COMMINATION OF AMPHEDEMINE AND DEXTRA AMPHEDAMINE NOW SOME OF YOU PROBABLY REALIZE THIS THAT ADRALL IS AMPHEDAMINE BUT I'M GUESSING THAT THERE A GOOD NUMBER OF YOU OUT THERE PERHAPS EVEN PA RANTS AND KIDS THAT DON'T REALIZE THAT THESE DRUGS LIKE COCANE AND AMPHEDAMINE METHEMPHEDAMINE WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS AND INCREDIBLY HABIT FORMING AND HAVE HYPOTENTIAL FOR ABUSE WELL THE FARMOSUITACAL VERSIONS OF THOSE ARE EXACTLY WHAT ARE USED TO TREAT EIHT GHT I THERE NOT EXACTLY LIKE COCANE OR METHEMPHEEMINE BUT THEY ARE STRUCTURALLY AND CHEMICALLY VERY SIMILAR AND THEIR NET EFFECT IN THE BRAIN AND BODY IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WHICH IS TO INCREASE DOPOMIE PRIMARILY BUT ALSO TO INCREASE LEVELS OF A NORMODULATOR CALLED APINEFRAN OR NOR EPINEFRAN ALSO CALLED NORA DRENALIN AND DRENAN THOSE NAMES OR THE SAME AND TO SOME EXTENT TO INCREASE LEVELS OF SERATONAN IN THE BRAIN AND BLOOD BUT NOT SO MUCH CERETONE THATS JUST KIND OF A SMALL SMIGIAN OF EFFECT OKISES O DOPEMINE WAY UP NOR EPINEFRN AND ADRENALIN WAY UP SO THAT MOTIV ATION DRIVE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND TO SOME EXTENT A LITTLE BIT OF SERATONAN WHICH IS REALLY MORE ABOUT FEELING CALM AND RELAXED AND YOU CALN IMAGINE WHY THAT WOULD BE A GOOD BALANCING EFFECT FOR DOPOMINE AND NOR UPINEFRAN SO WHAT AM ESSENTIALLY SAYING IS THAT THE DRUGS THAT ARE USED TO TREAT EIGHTY HT ARE STIMULANTS AND THEY LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE IN FACT NEARLY IDENTICAL TO SOME OF THE SO CALLED STREET DRUG STIMULANTS THAT WE ALL HEREARE SO TERRIBLE HOWEVER I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT AT THE APPROPRIATE DOSAGES AND WORKING WITH A QUALITY PSYCHATRIST R NEUROLOGIST ARE FAMILY PHYSICIAN DOES HAVE TO BE ABORD CERTIFIED EMDY THAT PRESCRIBES THESE THINGS MANY PEOPLE WITH EGHTY HT ACHIEVE EXCELLENT RELIEF WITH THESE DRUGS NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MANY OF THEM DO ESPECIALLY IF THESE TREATMENTS ARE STARTED EARLY IN LIFE SO NOW KNOWING WHAT THESE DRUGS ARE I WANT A RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHY PRESCRIBE THESE DRUGS I EVERYONE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION FOR THEMSELVES ARE FOR THEIR CHILD AS TO WHETHER NOT THEY'R GOING TO TAKE THESE THINGS OR NOT I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE MANY MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE TAKING THESE DRUGS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CLENICALLY DIAGNOS WITH EIGHTY GHT WHEN I SAY THESE DRUGS I 'M SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO RIDDLIN AND ATER ALL AND MODAPHENIL BUT MORE TYPICALLY ITS ATER ALL K PEOPLE USING COCAN AND AMPHEDAMINE FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BEAST AND IT IS INDEED A BEAST IN AT SOMETHING THAT I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE HOWEVER I AM AWARE THAT UP TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS AND PERHAPS AS MANY AS THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF ALL INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF SEVENTEEN AND THIRTY ARE TAKING ATER ALL ON A REGULAR OR SEMI REGULAR BASIS IN ORDER TO WORK IN ORDER TO STUDY AND IN ORDER TO FUNCTION AND FOCUS IN THEIR DAILY LIFE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH EIGHTY HT THERE'S WHLE BLACK MARKET FOR THIS THEY'RE GETTING IT FROM PEOPLE WITH PRESCRIPTIONS I'M NOT HERE TO PASS JUDGMENT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE HOW THESE DRUGS WORK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO TO ENHANCE COGNITION AND FOCUS THAT ACTUALLY SERVE THE BRAIN WELL AND CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND HOW THEY CAN BE VERY DETRO MENTAL IN OTHER INDIVIDUALS I SORT OF BLUE RIGHT PAST IT BUT THE FACT THAT IN UPWARDS OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TAKING THINGS LIKE ATARALL DESPITE NOT HAVING A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF AHDY T WELL THAT'S A RIDICULOUSLY HIGH NUMBER A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT ATARALL USED IN RIDDLING USE WITHOUT DIAGNOSIS OF AHDY T WAS SECOND IN INCIDENT ONLY TO CANABUS BUT ACTUALLY NOW THE CONSUMPTION OF ATARALL WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION IS HIGHER THAN THE CONSUMPTION OF CANABUS IN THAT AGE GROUP SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STIMULANT USE IN THAT AGE GROUP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ADULTS ALSO USING AN ABUSING STIMULANTS IN ORDER TO GAIN FOCUS  WE COULDHAVE AWHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER NOT LIFE IS BECOMING MORE DEMANDING WHETHER NOT THE NEED FOR PFOCUS IS EXCESSIVE AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT FRANKLY IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION BUT IT'S NOT ONE THAT WOULD DELIVER US TO ANY ANSWERS RATHER I LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE NOW AND PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SELF MEDICATING TO INCREASE FOCUS RIGHT KAFFINE WHICH I N INDULGE SOME I DON'T THINK TO EXCESS HAS LONG BEEN USED AS A STIMULANT TO INCREASE DOPEMIN INCREASE NORPIN EFFERANT INCREASE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND IN ADDITION TO THAT IT WORKS THROUGH THE SOCALLE CYCLIC AM P PHOSPHODIASTERATE PATHWAY MEMBER ANY TIME YOU SEE YOU HEAR IN A C THAT'S AN ENZIM PHOSPHODIASTERACE IS INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSION OF THINGS LIKE CYCLIC A M P INTO ENERGY FOR CELLS AND SO FORTH BHASELY COFFEE GIVES YOU ENERGY MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD AND IT INCREASES PFOCUS BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUTS THAT IT ENGAGES IN THE BRAIN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKING CAFFINE AND CONTINUTAKE CAFFIN FOR AGES PEOPLE ALSO USE TO SMOKE CIGARETTES NICOTINE IN ORDER TO GAIN FOCUS NOWDAYS THAT'S LESS COMMON BE CAUSE OF THE CONCERNS QUITE VALID CONCERNS ABOUT LUNG CANCER FROM SMOKING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF VAPING OUT THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW CONSUMING NICOTINE WHICH IS THE ACTIVE SUBSTANCE IN CIGARETTES AND IN MOST NICOTINE VAPES THAT STIMULATES THE BRAIN TO BE MORE FOCUS AND MORE ALERK SO THE IDEA OF TAKING STIMULANTS OF CONSUMING THINGS ARE SMOKING THINGS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ALERTNESS IS NOT A NEW IDEA IT'S JUST THAT IN EIGHTY HST IT'S SURPRISING THAT THESE THINGS WOULD WORK RIGHT I MEAN IF THE PROBLEM IS ATTENTION DEPHISIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE OR CHILDREN THAT ARE PERSCRIBED A DRUG THAT OUGHT TO BE A STIMULANT IT MOUGH IT OUGHT TO MAKE THEM HYPER HYPER ACTIVE AND RATHER THAN DOING THAT IT ACTUALLY SOMEHOW SERVES TO CALM THEM A B IT OR AT LEAST ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS HERE'S THE REASON CHILDREN HAVE A BRAIN THAT'S VERY PLASTIC MEANING IT CAN REMODEL ITSELF AND CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE VERY VERY QUICKLY COMPARED TO ADULTS TAKING STIMULANT AS A CHILD IF YOU ARE A CHILD DIAGNOS WITH EIGHTY HT ALLOWS THAT FOREBRAIN TASK RELATED NETWORK TO COME ON LINE TO BE ACTIVE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES AND BECAUSE THOSE CHILDREN ARE YOUNG IT ALLOWS THOSE CHILDREN TO LEARN WHAT FOCUS IS AND TO SORT OF FALLOW OR ENTER THAT TUNNEL OF FOCUS NOW BY TAKING A DRUG ITS CREATING FOCUS ARTIFICIALLY IT'S NOT CREATING FOCUS BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPERINTERESTED IN SOMETHING IT'S CHEMICALLY INDUCING A STATE OF FOCUS AND LET'S FACE IT A LOT OF CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL AND BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL ADULT IS ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO FOCUS EVEN TOUGH YOU DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING IN FACT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AT THIS LITTLE TRICK THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK FOR SOME OF YOU WHICH IS IF Y COULDN'T FOCUS ON THE MATERIAL I WAS TRYING TO LEARN I WOULD DELUDE MYSELF INTO THINKING THAT IT WAS THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN THE WORLD I WOULD JUST KIND OF LIE TO MYSELF AND TELL MYSELF OCE THIS I WON'T MENTION THE SUBJECTS O I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS I WOULD JUST I TELL MYSELF THAT I LOVED IT AND I NOTICE THAT JUST THAT SELECTIVE OR DELIBERATE ENGAGEMENT OF THAT DESIRE TO KNOW CIRCUIT WHATEVER THAT IS IN MY BRAIN NO DOUBT INVOLVES DOPOME ALLOWED ME TO FOCUS AND REMEMBER THE INFORMATION AND SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY OR PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY I WOULD OFTEN FALL IN LOVE WITH THE INFORMATION I FIND THAT THAT WAS MY FAVORITE CLASS WHOAS OF WHAT I WANTED TO LEARN THE MOST SO THAT'S ONE WAY YOU CAN DO IT ARTIFICIALLY BUT KIDS WITH EIGHTY EH THEY CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT THEY'RE TOLD TO SIT STILL AND THEY END OF GETTING UP A LEVEN TIMES W THEY ARE TOLD THAT THEY CAN'T SPEAK OUT IN CLASS OR THAT A THEY HAVE TO REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS FOR TEN MINUTES AND H JUST DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORT THEY SIMPLY CANNOT DO IT THEI'RE HIGHLY DISTRACTABLE SO WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THIS WHOLE PICTURE THAT WE NEED MORE DOPOMINE BUT THESE KIDS WITH EIGHTY HT THEY'R GETTING THEIR DOPAOMINE BY WAY OF A DRUG WHICH IS FOR ALL THE WORLD EMPHETAMINES RIGHT ITS SPEED THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS WHAT AR THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES WHETE AS THE SHORTRM CONSEQUENCES AND WHAT SHALL WE MAKE OF PEOPLE TAKING THESE DRUGS WITHOUT A CLINICAL MEAN WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES THERE WELL IN ORDER TO GET TO SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS I WENT TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES THIS IS A COLLEAGUE THAT I'VE ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME I WAS THEIR TEACHING ASSISTANT WHEN THEY WERE IN UNDERGRADUATE THEY WENT ON TO GET AN EMDY A MEDICAL DEGREE AS WELL AS A P HT AND HAVE BECOME A PEDIATRIC NAUROLOGIST THAT SPECIALIZES IN THE TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY AND EIGHTY EIGHT ST AND KIDS OF ALL AGES FROM EGH THREE TO TWENTY ONE THAT'S THE ADRANGE PRETTY BROAD ADRANGE AND HAS EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AND WHAT MAKES THEM PARTICULARLY INTERESTING FORSAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT THEY HAVE A CHILD A YOUNG BOY WHOSE NOW SHOWING SIGNS OF EIHTY ST AND THEY ARE ON THE THRESHOLD OF TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER R NOT THEY WILL PRESCRIBE AT ER ALL OR SOMETHING SIMILAR SO WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND PRIOR TO LEARNING THAT THEIR CHILD MAY HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT I ASKED THE FALLING QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL I ASKED WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT GIVING YOUNG KIDS AM PEDAMI AND THEIR ANSWER WAS YOU KNOW ON THE FACE OF IT IT SEEMS CRAZY BUT PROVIDED THAT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE DOSE IS USED AND THAT THAT DOSAGE IS MODULATED AS THEY GROW OLDER AND DEVELOP THOSE POWERS OF ATTENTION THEIR OBSERVATION WAS THAT THEY'VE SEEN MORE KIDS BENEFIT THEN NOT BENEFIT FROM THAT NOW I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO GO TO A DOCTOR BECAUSE AS I WI SAY I'M NOT A DOCTOR I DON'T PRESCRIBE ANYTHING ON A PROFESSORS MY PROFESS THINGS AND HEARE ON PROFESSING THAT YOU TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU'R CONSIDERING GIVING RIDDLE IN OR ATTER ALL OR ANY TYPE OF STIMULANT TO YOUR CHILD OF COURSE WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT TAN THE HEALTH OF YOUR CHILD BUT IS A VERY INTERESTING ANSWER BECAUSE TYPICALLY WE HEAR YES MEDICATOR DON'T MEDICATE RARELY DO WE HEAR THAT THE MEDICATION SHOULD BE ADJUSTED ACROSS THE LIFE SPIN IN IN ANY PARTICULAR KIND OF WAY NOW THE FACT THAT THIS PERSON THIS NOW FRIEND OF MINE AND COLLEAGUE OF MINE HAS SO MUCH EXPERTIESE IN THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN WORKS AND IS CONSIDERING PUTTING THEIR CHILD ON SUCH MEDICATION I SAID WYOU KNOW WHY WOULDN'T YOU WAIT UNTIL YOUR KID REACHES PUBERTY AND WE KNOW THAT IN BOYS AND IN GIRLS THERE INCREASES IN TESTOSTERON AN ESTERGENDURING PUBERTY THAT DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT THE BODY APPEARS BUT ALSO THAT DRAMATICALLY CHANGED THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW THIS THAT PUBERTY TRIGGERS THE ACTIVATION OF SO CALLED FRONTIO TEMPERAL TASK RELATED EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING THAT'S JUST FANCY SCIENCE SPEAK FOR BEING ABLE TO FOCUS BEING ABLE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION BEING ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR IMPULSES LOOK AT A SMALL CHILD OR LOOK AT A PUPPY AND THEN LOOK AT AN OLDER CHILD OR LOOK AT A DOG VERY DIFFERENT LEVELS PATTERNS OF SPONTANEOUS BEHAVIOUR YOUNG CHILDREN MOVE AROUND A LOT THEIRE THERE IDONCE A SHIFTY CAUSE THAT MAKES ITS ONLY DHRUP TO SOMETHING BAD WHICH THEY MIGHT BE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE UP TO SOMETHING BAT THEY FIDGET A LOT SO TO PUPPIES EVERYTHING'S A STIMULUS AS ANIMALS AND HUMANS GET OLDER THEY LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THEIR BEHAVIOR AND SIT STILL LISTEN AND FOCUS EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT TO SO GIVING A DRUG THAT ALLOWS A CHILD TO ACCESS THAT STILLNESS EARLY ON IT'S THOUGHT WILL ALLOW THEM TO MAINTAIN THAT ABILITY AS TIME GOES ON BUT I DECIDE TO PUSH A LITTLE BIT FURTHER I SAID WELL WHY WOULD YOU DO IT NOW AS OPPOSED TO DURING PUBERTY OR AFTER PUBERTY AND THEIR ANSWER WAS VERY SPECIFIC AND I THING VERY IMPORTANT WHAT THEY SAID WAS LOOK NOURAL PLASTICITY IS GREATEST IN CHILDHOOD AND TAPERS OFF AFTER ABOUT AGE TWENTY FIVE BUT NEUROL PLASTICITY FROM AGE THREE UNTIL AGE TWELVE OR THIRTEEN IS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND THEIR RIGHT WHEN YOU SIT BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON NARROW PLASTICITY YOU SAY CHILDHOOD PLASTICITY AND YOUNG ADULT PLASTICITY IS MUCH GREATER THAN ADULT PLASTICITY BUT THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD OF PLASTICITY IS FAR AND AWAY THE PERIOD IN WHICH YOU CAN RESHAPE THE BRAIN AT AN ACCELERATED RATE SO THIS LINES UP REALLY WELL WITH THE CLINICAL LITERATURE NOT SURPRISINGLY THEIR CLINITION THAT EARLY TREATMENT IS KY IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH A QUALITY PHYSICION AND TREAT THESE THINGS EARLY THESE DRUGS CAN ALLOW THESE FRONTO CIRCUITS THESE TASCRELATED CIRCUITS TO ACHIEVE THEIR APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF FUNCTIONING AND FORKIDS TO LEARN HOW TO FOCUSS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CONTECTS NOW IS THAT THE ONLY THING THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING OF COURSE NOT SO THE NEXT QUESTION I ASKED WAS WHAT SH WE MAKE OF ALL THIS DIET RELATED STUFF RIGHT I'VE HEARD BEFORE THAT THE SO CALLED ELIMINATION DIET OR IN JUSTING NO SUGARS OR NO DAIRY OR NO GLUTEN THAT ALL THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN PROPORTED TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF AHTY T AND PEOPLE AND PARENTS WITH AGHTY HT GO TO FANATIC LENGTHS TO TRY IND FIND THE EXACT FOODS THAT ARE QUAUSING PROBLEMS AND THE EXACT FOODS THAT THE KIDS CAN EAT IN ORDER TO TRY AND GET THEIR BRAIN WIRED UP RIGHT AND CORRECTLY AND TO AVOID LIFE LONG HTY T THEIR ANSWER WAS REALLY INTERESTING BUT BEFORE I TELL YOU THEIR ANSWER I WANT TO TELL YOU THE STUDIES AND THE DATA RELATED TO THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT FOOD AND THE CONSTELLATION OF FOODS THAT ONE AVOIDS AND WILLY HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH ARE LEVELS OF ATTENTION AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER OR NOT THAT CAN BE USED AS A LEVERAGE POINT TO TREAT ADY T SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE CHALLENGES OF EXPLORING THE ROLL OF DIET AND NUTRICION IN ANY STUDY BUT ESPECIALLY IN A STUDY ON AHTY T WHY WELL BECAUSE AS I MENTION BEFORE CHILDREN WITH AGHTY H T AND IT TURNS OUT ADULTS WITH ATY H TE TEND TO PURSUE SUGARY FOODS OR ANY TYPES OF FOOD THAT INCREASE THEIR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE THEY ARE NATURALLY DRAWN TO THOSE FOODS WHETHER NOT THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT PRESUMABLY AS A WAY TO TRY AND TREAT THEIR LACK OF FOCUS AND IMPULSIVITY SO IN THIS STUDY THAT AM ABOUT TO SHARE WITH YOU THERE WAS NO DRUG TREATMENT IT WAS JUST TO STUDY MANIPULATING DIET AND INVOLVED A HUNDRED CHILDREN FIFTY IN THE SO CALLED ELIMINATION DIET GROUP THE SPECIAL DIET WERE CERTAIN FOODS WERE ELIMINATED AND FIFTY IN THE SOCAL CONTROL GROUP HOWEVER BEING A WELL DESIGN RANDOMIZE CONTROLLED TRIAL THE STUDY ALSO INCLUDED A CROSSOVER MEANING WHERE THE THE KIDS WOULD SERVE AS THEIR OWN CONTROL OR CONTROL GROUP AT A CERTAIN PORTION THE STUDIES THEY WU BE IN ONE GROUP WHERE THEY ELIMINATE CERTAIN FOODS AND THEN AFTER APPEARIED OF TIME IN THE STUDY THEY WOULD SWOP TO THE OTHER GROUP THIS IS A POWERFUL WAY TO DESIGNE TO STUDY FOR REASONS THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE BECAUSE YOU START TO ELIMINATE CHANGE IS AN EFFECTS DUE TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN ANY CASE HUNDRED CHILDREN TOTAL FIFTY IN EACH GROUP AT ANY ONE PERIOD IN TIME AND THE EFFECTS THAT THEY OBSERVED WERE EXTREMELY DRAMATIC IN THE WORLD OF STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC DATA WE TALK ABOUT PE VALUES PROBABILITY VALIES WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN ACCORDING TO CHANCE AND TIPICALLY THE CUT OFF WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE PE LESS THAN POINT O FIVE THAT'S A LESS THAN POINT O FIVE CHANCE ESSENTIALLY OF THE EFFECT BEING DUE TO CHANCE HOWEVER IN THIS STUDY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE EFFECTS AS PE LESS THAN POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO ONE VERY VERY INFINTISIMALLY SMALL PROBABILITY THAT THE EFFECT OBSERVE COULD BE DUE TO CHANCE TO WHAT WERE THESE EFFECTS THESE EFFECTS WERE ENHANCED ABILITY TO FOCUS LESS IMPULSIVITY EVEN LESS TENDENCY TO MOVE WHEN TRYING TO SIT STILL SO EVERYTHING FROM MENTAL FOCUS TO THE ABILITY O CONTROLL THEIR BODIES IMPROVED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE ELIMINATION DIET GROUP WHAT WAS ELIMINATED WELL THE ELIMINATION DIED IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WAS A SO CALLED ONLY GO ANTIGENIC DET IT WAS A DIET IN WHICH EACH KID TOOK A TASS TO DETERMINE WHICH FOODS THEY HAD ANTIBODIES FOR MEANING THAT THEY WERE MILDLY ELERGIC TO NOW IN THIS STUDY WAS VERY IMPORTANT THT THE KIDS NOT BE EXTREMELY ELERGIC TO ANY FOOD BECAUSE AS I MENTION BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY SERVED AS A CONTROL AT ONE POINT IN THE STDY WHERE THEY WERE EATING ALL SORTS OF FOODS INCLUDIN FOODS THAT THEY HAD MILD ALORGIES TO SO BASICALLY WHATH THE STUDY SAID WAS THAT ELIMINATING FOODS TO WHICH CHILDREN HAVE ALOGIES CAN DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THEIR SYMPTOMS OF DI T AND THIS STUDY NOT SURPRISINGLY BECAUSE IT WAS PUBLISHED IN SUCH A HIG QUALITY JOURNAL LANCIT ET CETERA LARGE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS SET THE WORLD ON FIRE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT THESE RESULTS BECAUSE HERE IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY DRUG TREATMENT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ADIE TE SYMPTOMS OBSERVED AND THEN CAME THE CRITICISMS SO MANY PAPERS WERE PUBLISHED AFTER THIS SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH REANALYSIS OF THESE DATA AND I WANT TO BE FAIR IN SAYING THAT THE DATA ON THE PAPER LOOK GOOD BUT THERE ORE CRITICISMS OF THE OVER ALL STRUCTURAL DESIGN IN THE STUDY I DONT WNT Y GOING TO ALL THE DETAILS EXACTLY CAUSE IT GETS REALLY NUANTS ABOUT SOME OF THE STATISTICS IN THE WAY THAT ONE EXAMINES THESE TYPES OF DATA BUT THERE WAS SCEPTICISM AND IN SCIENCE SKEPTICISM IS HEALTHY ESPECIALLY WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER NOT TO TREAT OR FEED CHILDREN ONE FOOD OR ANOTHER OR GIVE THEM ONE DRUG OR ANOTHER NOW OI WONT A RETURN TO THE STORY OF MY FRIEND WHO IS AT PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGISTS AND TREATS GHTY T AND HAS A CHILD WHO IS ON THE PRECIPICE OF PERHAPS STARTING TO TAKE DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADIT I ASKED THE SIMPLE QUESTION DO YOU SEE AN EFFECT OF DIET MEANING WHEN PARENTS CONTROL THE DIET OF THEIR CHILDREN DOES IT MAKE A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WERE NO DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT THE KID'S RESPOND TO EIGHTY EHT DRUGS LIKE RIDDLIN AND AFTER ALL OR WHETHER NOT IT CAN HELP THEM AVOID TREATING WITH THOSE DRUGS ENTIRELY AND HER RESPONSE WAS VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD SHE SAID ELIMINATION OF SIMPLE SUGARS HAS A DRAMATIC AND POSITIVE EFFECT SHE'S OBSERVE THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN MANY DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS NOW THAT'S NOT A PUREREVIEWED STUDY THAT'S A STATEMENT THAT I'M CONVEYING TO YOU ANECDOTALLY BUT IT'S A HIGHLY HIGHLY INFORMED ONE I SAID WHAT ABOUT THESE ELIMINATION DIETS SHE SAID AND I FOUND OTHER SOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS THAT THESE ONLY GO INTO GENIC DIETS ARE CONTROVERSIAL THERE MANY PEOPLE WHO REALLY BELIEVE IN IDENTIFYING ALL THE THINGS THAT YOURE ELERGIC TO AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU AND ESPECIALIER KIDS AVOID THOSE FOODS HOWEVER THERE'S ANOTHER CAMP THAT STARTING TO EMERGE IN THE PURE REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SHOWING THAT WHEN KIDS ARE NOT EXPOSED TO SERTAIN FOODS IN PARTICULAR NOT SIN THINGS OF THAT SORT THEY DEVELOP ALARGIES TO THOSE FOODS AND THEN WHEN EXPOSED TO THEM LATER THEY CAUSE REAL PROBLEMS SO THERE'S A WHOLE GALIXY OF DISCUSSION AND CONTROVERSY AND OUTRIGHT FIGHTING ABOUT ALARGIES AND KIDS AND WHETHER NOT THE OLLYGO INTO GENICDIT IS THE APPROPRATE ONE HOWEVER OUT OF THE FOR NAUROLOGISTS AND PSYCHATRIS THAT I SPOKE TO ABOUT EIGHTY TY IN PREPARATION FOR THIS EVERY SINGLE ONE SAID CHILDREN WITH AHDYT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO AVOID HIGH SUGAR AND SIMPLE SUGAR FOODS OF MOST KINDS AND IF THEY CAN FIND PARTICULAR FOODS THAT EXASCERBATE THOSE SYMPTOMS OBVIOUSLY ELIMINATING THOSE FOODS IS BENEFICIAL AND THE FOODS THAT EXASCERBATE THEIR SYMPTOMS CHANGE OVER TIME SO I DON'T LIKE GIVING A COMPLICATED ANSWER BUT I ALSO DON'T LIKE GIVING IN INCOMPLETE ANSWER WHAT THIS TELLS ME IS THAT CHILDREN AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG CHILDREN WHO HAVE AD T SHOULD PROBABLY NOT EAT MUCH SUGAR IN PARTICULAR SIMPLE SUGARS IN ADDITION TO THAT EXPLORING WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE EXISTING ALARGIES TO FOODS THEY ALREADY CONSUME MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THIS PAPER THE PELCER AT ALL LANCEAT PAPER SEEMS TO SPEAK TO AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT THAT PAPER IS PUBLISH IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DOZENS OF STUDIES EXPLORING THE SAME THING AS WELL AS MED ANALYSIES OF ALL THOSE DATA AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT DIET CAN HAVE A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT ROLL IN ELIMINATING ORELEAST REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS OF EGHTY T SO MUCH SO THAT SOME OF THE CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO NOT TAKE MEDICATION AT ALL AR EVENTUALLY WEAN THEMSELVES OFF MEDICATION AS YOUNG ADULTS AND AS ADULTS ONE INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHETHER NOT ADULTS SHOULD MODIFY THEIR DIET IN ORDER TO INCREASED THEIR LEVELS OF FOCUS IF THEY ARE ALREADY HAVING NORMAL LEVELS OF FOCUS BUT WOULD LIKE MORE OR WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE EXISTING ADULT EGHDY T THAT'S AND INTERESTING AND EVEN MORE CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC IT BRINGS US RIGHT INTO THE REALM OF WHAT ARE CALLED OMEGATHREE FADIACIDS THAVE TALKED MANY TIMES ON THIS PODCASTS ABOUT THE KNOWN BENEFITS OF OMEGATHRE PFADIACIDS IN PARTICULAR IT GETTING A ONE GRAHAM ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OR MORE EVEN AS MUCH AS TWO THOUSAND MILIGRAMS EACH DAY OF THE SO CALLED E P A COMPONENT OF OMEGOTHRE FADIACIDS KNOWN TO HAVE ANTO DEPRESSAN EFFECTS MOOD ELEVATING EFFECTS KNOWN TO HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS PROTECTING THE CARTY OF ASCULAR SYSTEM I THINK IT'S NOW CLEAR THAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ALSO BENEFITS THAT OMEGOTHRE FADACIDS THAT INCLUDE A GRAHAM OR MORE OF E P S THER VERY BENEFICIAL TYPICALLY THAT'S DONE THROUGH FICIOILE LIQUID FICHIOILS GOIG TO BE THE MOST COSTIFICIENT BUT THEIR CAPISAL FORMS FOR THOSE OFV YOU DON'T LIKE FISHOIL YOU CAN INJUSTIS THROUGH OTHER MEANS OU YOU GET FROM CERTAIN ALGIES OR CRILL ET CETERA AVTO MAKE A MAKE IT COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR PARTICULAR DIET WITH ANOT YOUR VEGAN ORIGITARIAN OR OMNIVORE ET CETERA OMEGOTHRIES HAVE SHOWN BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE ALL THESE POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS DO THEY HAVE POSIV EFFECTS ON FOCUS AND ATTENTION AND THE ANSWER IS YOU CAN FINE STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT AND THE EFFECTS ARE SIGNIFICANT BUT THE EFFECTS ARE MODEST YOU CAN ALSO FIND STUDIES THAT SHOW KNO EFFECT HOWEVER MUCH LIKE WITH OMEGOTHRES AND ANTI DEPRESSENCS WHEREBY INGESTION OF OMEGOTHRE FATIACIDS OF A GRAMMAR MORE OF E P T PER DAY ALLOWS PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION TO GET AWAY WITH TAKING LOWER DOSES OF ANTIDEPRESSENT MEDICATION IT DOES SEEM THAT INGESTION OF OMEGOTHRE FADIACIDS IN ADULTS THAT INCLUDE E PAS OF A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OR MORE CAN ALLOW ADULTS WITH EIGHTY EHTY OR MILD ATTENTION DEFISAT ISSUES TO FUNCTION WELL ON LOWER DOSES OF MEDICATION AND IN RARE CASES TO ELIMINATE MEDICATION ENTIRELY SO WHAT THIS SAYS IS ONCE AGAIN THAT THE OMEGTHRE FADIACIDS ARE BENEFICIAL WILL THEY CURE OR ELIMINATE EIGHTY EHT I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY NO THEY ARE PLAYING A SUPPORTIVE OR WHAT WE CALL A MODULATORY ROLE JUST LIKE GOOD SLEEP PLAYS A SUPPORTIVE AND MODULATORY ROLE FOR ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING YOUR EMUNE SYSTEM YOUR ABILITY TO THINK YOUR ABILITY REGULATE YOUR EMOTION ITS MODULATING THAT PROCESS THIS COMPONENT OF MODULATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND I THINK I WANT A SPEND A MOMENT ON IT BECAUSE AS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXTS OF EGHTY HHT AND ALL THE INFORMATION THATS OUT THERE THEREBIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT ARE MEDIATED BY PARTICULAR COMPOUNDS LIKE DOPAMINE SO FOR INSTANCE THE ABILITY TO FEEL MOTIVATED TO ATTEND TO FOCUS IS IMEDIATED BY THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT RELEASE DOPAMY HOWEVER ATTENTION IS ALSO MODULATED BY HOW RESTED YOU ARE IF YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE OURABILITY TO THINK WELL AT ALL TO STAY UP FOR TWO NIGHTES AND DON'T SLEEP AT ALL RIGHT IF YOU DO THAT YOU WILL HAVE MODULATED THE CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT RESPOND TO VARIOUS THINGS AND YOU WILL BE HIGHLY DISTRACTABLE YOU WILL BE HIGHLY EMOTIONAL YOU WILL FEEL LIKE GARBAGE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SLEEP MEDIATES FOCUS AND ATTENTION IT MODULATES IT INDIRECTLY LIKEWISE I THINK THESE A MEGATHRY FATIACIDS IN PARTICULAR THE EPAS WHICH ARE SO BENEFICIAL FOR MOOD AND APPARENTLY ALSO FOR ATTENTION THEY DON'T DIRECTLY MEDIATE ATTENTION AND MOOD WHAT THEY DO AS THEY MODULATE THOSE CIRCUITS THEY MAKE DOPAMIN MORE AVAILABLE THEY MAKE WHATEVER DOPEING IS AVAILABLE MORE LIKELY TO BIND TO THE VARIOUS RECEPTORS THAT ARE PRESENT ON NURANDS AND SO FORTH AND I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE LIKEWISE DET IN ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT NUTRICION HAS TO INCLUDE THIS FRAMEWORK OF IS THE DIET THE ELIMINATION DIET OR WHETHER NOT AT SOME OTHER DET OR ESOTERDACEDOGENICDI IS IT MODULATING OR MEDIATING A PROCESS AND MOST LIKELY IN THE CONTECT OF ADIT ITS MODULATING THAT PROCESS SO IF THE DIT IS MILD OR IF IT'S CAUGHT EARLY ENOUGH OR FITS IN CONJUNCTION WITH PHARMOCOLOGY WITH A PRESCRIPTION TREATMENT WELL THEN IT MIGHT HELP GIDE THE CHILD OR ADULT TO A BETTER PLACE OF BEING ABLE TO FOCUS BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE SWITCH THAT FLIPS EVERYTHING NOW THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT CONSUMING THE WRONG FOOD SUGARY FOODS OR FOODS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE ELURGIC TO IS A GOOD IDEA IT WILL STILL BE DETRIMENTAL SO I HOPE THAT CONCEPTIONAL FRAMEWORK HELPS CAUSE IF YOU GO ON LINE IF YOURE SOMEBODY WITH EIGHTY TYOU OR NOT YOU ARE GOING TO BE BOMBARDED WITH THE EHTIT DIET THE OLYGO INTOGENIC DIET THE ELIMINAH THIS THE THIS SUPPLEMENT THAT EPI AND YOU I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER NOT YOUR TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING MEDIATING A PROCESS OR MODULATING A PROCESS NOW DRUGS LIKE RIDLAN DRUGS LIKE ATARAL THEY ARE TAPPING IN TO THE CIRCUITRIES AND THE NURO CHEMISTRIES THAT MEDIATE ATTENTION IN FOCUSS THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVES OR THE ONLY CHOICES RATHER FOR TREATMENT OF THESE CIRCUITS AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS IMIN A TALK ABOUT OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND SOME BEHAVIAL ALTERNTIVES THAT ARE NOT VERY WELL KNOWN BUT ARE VERY VERY EFFECTIVE IN A FEW MINUTES BUT I REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN MODULATION AND MEDIATION BECAUSE IT'S VITAL FOR ANY ONE THAT'S TRYING TO MODULATE OR MEDIATE ANYTHING WITHIN THEIR OWN BRAIN IF ANY OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS OLEGO ANTOGENIC DIET AS IT RELATES TO EIGHTY  T AND YOU WANT TO EXPLORE A MORE RECENT STUDY BESIDES THAT CLASSIC TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN LANCEIT STUDY THAT'S RATHER CONTROVERSIAL THERE'S A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIETRY JUST LAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS OLYGO ANTOGENIC DI IMPRUVES CHILDREN'S EIGHTY  ST RADING SCALE SCORES RELIABLY IN ADDED VIDIO RATING THE ADDED VEORADING IS JUST AT THEIR USING AN ADDITIONAL ME SSURE OF FOCUS AN ATTENTION AGAIN THAT'S FRONTIERS AND PSYCHAETRY TWENTY TWENTY I'LL PUT A LINK TO IT IN THE CAPTION AND THAT'S A MORE RECENT STUDY FOR YOU TO PERUSE SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE NORL CIRCUITS OF FOCUS AND THE CHEMISTRY OF FOCUS BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED YET ABOUT WHAT WOULD MAKE US BETTER AT FOCUSSING AND WHAT FOCUSSING BETTER REALLY IS SO LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE FOCUS AND HOW TO GET BETTER AT FOCUS AND I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A TOOL FOR WHICH THERE ARE TERRIFIC RESEARCH DATA THAT WILL ALLOW YOU IN A SINGLE SESSION TO ENHANCE YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS IN THEORY FOR EVER WHAT AM ABOUT TO READ YOU IS FROM AN EXCELLENT BOOK THAT I RECOMMEND IF ANY OF YOUR INTEREST IN NEURO SCIENCE AND THINGS LIKE MEDITATION AND DEFAULT MOD NET WORKS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THE BOOK IS CALLED ALTER TRAITS SCIENCE REVEALS HOW MEDITATION CHANGES YOUR MIND BRAINED IN BODY AND KNOW I 'M NOT GOING TO TRY AND CONVINCE YOU TO MEDITATE I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A SMALL PASSAGE IN THE BOOK THAT RELATE SOME RESEARCH DATA RELATED TO FOCUS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO MEDITATE THAT'S YOUR CHOICE THAT'S A SEPARATE MATTER THIS IS A BOOK BY DANIEL GOLLMAN AND RICHARD DAVIDSON I SHOULD DISPENSION THAT A GOLLMAN IS A WELL KNOWN AUTHOR I'S WRITTEN BOOKS ON EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SO FORTH A RICHARD DAVIDSON IS A ALSO A P H T I'S A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY AND AT HE'S AT A UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISIN STONE TERRIFIC WORK ON BRAIN STATES A AND MODULATION OF BRAIN STATES AND SO FORTH WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT IS WHEN ATTENTION WORKS AND WHEN ATTENTION FALTERS AND WHAT WE ARE SPECIFICALLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT ARE WHAT ARE CALLED ATTENTIONAL BLINKS NOT ACTUAL I BLINKS WERE IN TALK ABOUT THAT IN A FEW MINUTES BUT WERE GON TALK ABOUT ATTENTIONAL BLINKS I'M PARAPHRASING HERE BECAUSE GOLLMAN AND DAVIDSON WROTE ABOUT THIS SO BEAUTIFULLY I'D RATHER PARAPHRASE FROM THEM THAN TRYING JUST MAKE UP A NEW WAY TO SAY IT THAT IS LESS INTERESTING OR LESS GOOD BUT I WANT A CREDIT THEM ATTENTIONAL BLINKS OWR REALLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU THINK ABOUT A WERES WALDO TASK YOU KNOW THIS TASK WHERES WALDO WERE YOU THE BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND OBJECTS AND THINGS IN IN A PICTURE AND SOMEWHERE IN THERE IS WALDO WITH THE STRIPE TAD AND THE GLASS IS IN C SKINNEY DOD AND YOU HAVE TO FINE WALDO AND SO IT'S A VISUAL SEARCH AND IT'S VISUAL SEARCH FOR AN OBJECT THAT HAS DISTINCT FEATURES BUT IS IMBEDDED IN THIS OCEAN OF OTHER THINGS THAT COULD EASILY BE CONFUSED AS WALDOS YOU TEND TO LOOK LIK LIK LI LOIK LIK LIK LIK H LOOK THEN YOU FIND WALDO KITS CAN DO THIS THEY ENJOY DOING THIS ADULTS MAYRE MAY NOT ENJOY IT BUT THEY CAN DO IT TO THEY FIND WALDO WHEN YOU FIND WALDO OR WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR A TARGET IN SOME OTHER VISUAL SEARCH TASK AT THAT MOMENT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CELEBRATES A LITTLE BIT AND IT CELEBRATES THROUGH THE RELEASE OF NEROCHEMICALS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD YOU FOUND IT AND YOU PAUS NOW THE PAUS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN YOU PAUS WHAT WE KNOW FROM MANY EXPERIMENTS IS THAT IN THAT MOMENT OF PUSE AND MILD CELEBRATION HOWEVER MILD YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE AN NOTHER WALL THOSH SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO IT SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS IN ATTENDING TO SOMETHING IN SEARCHING AND IN IDENTIFYING A VISUAL TARGET YOUR ATTENTION BLINKED IT SHUT OFF FOR A SECOND AND THERE'S A MORE FORMAL AND MORE LABORATORY TYPE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT THIS THE MORE TYPICAL WAY TO DO THIS IS TO GIVE SOME ONE A STRING OF LETTERS OR A STRING OF NUMBERS AND BEFOREHAND YOU TELL THEM BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THE LETTERS ARE AND Z YOU'E JUST GOND IT WATCH THIS STRING OF NUMBERS GO BY AND THERE WILL BE A LETTER ARE AND THERE AND THERE WILL BE A LETTER Z AN THERE AND TRYING SPOT THEM BOTH AND WHAT YOU FIND IS WHEN YOU PRESENT THAT STRING OF NUMBERS AND THEN THEY SEE THE ARE I SEE THE ARE THEY REGISTER IT CONSCIOUSLY AND THEY TEND TO MISS THE Z JUST LIKE IN THE WALTHOH TYPE EXAMPLE NOW OF COURSE THE NUMBERS ARE GOING BY PRETTY QUICKLY BUT THEY CAN SPOT THE ARE THEY COULD ALSO SPOUGHT THE Z IF YOU TOLD THEM BEFOREHAND JUST SPOT THE Z AND THE NUMBERS ARE MOVING THROUGH AT THE SAME RATE IN BOTH CONDITIONS SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IN EVERY CASE YOU ARE TAPABLE OF SEEING THE ARE OR THE Z IT'S WHEN YOU TRY AND SEE BOTH THAT SEEING THE FIRST ONE PREVENTS YOU FROM SEEING THE SECOND ONE IT'S WHAT WE CALL AN ATTENTIONAL BLINK WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME AND PEOPLE WITH AD H T TEND TO HAVE MANY MORE ATTENTIONAL BLINKS THAN PEOPLE THAT DON'T AND THIS IS TRUE FOR CHILDREN AND FOR ADULTS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT SO IMPORTANT THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IT TWICE IN CASE YOU ATTENTIONALLY BLINK IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT YOUR LOOKING FOR OR YOUR VERY INTERESTED IN SOMETHING YOU ARE DEFINITELY MISSING OTHER INFORMATION IN PART BECAUSE YOU'RE OVER FOCUSING ON SOMETHING AND THIS LEADS TO A VERY INTERESTING HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT GO WRONG AND EIGHTY H T WHERE WE'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THEY CANNOT FOCUS AND YET WE KNOW THEY CAN FOCUS ON THINGS THEY CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT WELL MAYBE JUST MAYBE THEY ARE EXPERIENCING MORE ATTENTIONAL BLINKS THEN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE EHTY H T AND INDEED THERE ARE DATA NOW TO SUPPORT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THAT SHOULD BE EXCITING TO ANYONE THAT HAS EIGHTY H T IT SHOULD ALSO BE EXCITING TO ANYONE THAT CARES ABOUT INCREASING THEIR FOCUS AND THEIRE ABILITY TO ATTEND WHAT THIS IS SAYING IS THAT THESE CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE FOCUS IN OUR ABILITY TO ATTEND AND OUR ABILITY TO ELIMINATE DISTRACTION THEY AREN'T JUST FAILING TO FOCUS THAT'S JUST JUST SAMANTIC WAY OF DESCRIBING THE OUTCOME THEY ARE OVER FOCUSING ON CERTAIN THINGS AND THEREBY MISSING OTHER THINGS AND SO ARE JUST S TRACTABILITY OR THE DISTRACTABILITY OF SOMEBODY WITH EIGHTY T COULD EXIST BECAUSE THEY ARE OVER FOCUSSING ON CERTAIN ELEMENTS AND THERE ARE THEREFORE MISSING OTHER ELEMENTS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ATTENDING TO SO WHAT THEY REALLY NEED IS THIS PROPERTY THAT WE CALL OPEN MONITERING NOW OPEN MONORING IS SOMETHING THAT'S DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK THAT I JUST REFER TO AND THAT TYPICALLY IS ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE A LOT OF  MEDITATION SO CALL VIPOSSINA MEDITATION OR IF SPENT A LOT OF TIME LEARNING HOW TO DO WHAT'S CALLED OPEN GAZE VISUAL ANALYSIS AND OPEN GAZE THINKING BUT THERE'S A SIMPLER VERSION OF THIS THAT ALLOWS US TO BUY PASS ALL THAT FIRST OF ALL YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM HAS TWO MODES OF PROCESSING IT CAN BE HIGHLY FOCUS A SODA STRAW VIEW SO LOOKING FOR THE ARE IN THIS STRING OF NUMBERS AND THAN EXAMPLE THAT I JUST GAVE OR IF YOU'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING YOURE THAT SODA STRAW VIEW OF THE WORLD AND YOUR MISSING OTHER THINGS K THAT'S HIGH LEVELS OF ATTENTION HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO A PROPERTY OF YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DILATE YOUR GAZE TO BE IN SO CALL PANORAMIC VISION PANORAMIC VISION IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE AND I CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW YOU WON'T KNOW THAT I 'M DOING IT BUT EVEN THOUGH I AM STILL LOOKING DIRECTLY AT YOU I'M CONSCIOUSLY DILATING MY GAZE SO THAT I CAN SEE THE SEALING THE FLOOR AND THE WALLS ALL AROUND ME THAT PANORMIC VISION IS ASHALY MEDIATED BY A SEPARATE STREAM OR SET OF NERAL CIRCUITS GOING FROM THE EYE INTO THE BRAIN AND IT'S A STREAME OR SET OF CIRCUITS THAT ISN'T JUST WIDE ANGLE VIEW IT ALSO IS BETTER AT PROCESSING THINGS IN TIME IT'S FRAME RATE IS HIGHER S YOU'VE SEEN SLOW MOTION VIDIO AND YOU'VE SEEN STANDARD VIDIO SLOW MOTION VIDIO GIVES YOU THAT SLOW MOTION LOOK BECAUSE IT'S HIGHER FRAME RATE YOUR THIN SLICING TIME OK YOU CAN USE PANORAMIC VISION TO ACCESS THE STATE THAT WE CALL OPEN MONITERING WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ATTEND TO AND RECOGNIZE MULTIPLE TARGETS WITHIN THIS STRING OF NUMBERS THEY CAN SEE THE ARE AND THEY CAN SEE THE Z AND THEY CAN SEE ADDITIONAL THINGS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TRAINED UP AND PEOPLE CAN PRACTICE WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE EIGHTY HT OR NOT WHAT INVOLVES IS LEARNING HOW TO DILATE YOUR GAZE CONSCIOUSLY THAT'S I SHOULD QUITE EASY FOR MOST PEOPLE WHETHER NOT YOU WEARE DIRECTIVE LENSES OR CONTACTS OR NOT YOU CAN CONSCIOUSLY GOING TO OPEN GAZE AND THAN YOU CAN CONTRACT YOUR FIELD OF VIEW AS WELL THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN STUDIES DONE WHERE PEOPLE WERE TAUGHT TO THINK IN A PARTICULAR WAY FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT FOREVER CHANGED THEIR ABILITY TO LIMIT OR REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THESE ATTENTIONAL BLINKS THERE ARE NOW PUBLISH ACCOUNTS IN THE LITERATURE OF A SIMPLE PRACTICE DONE FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES WHERE SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO JUST SIT QUIETLY EYES CLOSED AND DO WHAT IS SORT OF AKIN TO MEDITATION BUT TO NOT DIRECT THEIR MIND INTO ANY PARTICULAR STATE OR PLACE BUT SIMPLY TO THINK ABOUT THEIR BREATHING AND TO FOCUS ON THEIR SO CALLED IN TERRACEPTION FOCUS ON HOW THEIR BODY FEELS THEIR MIND DRIFTED TO BRING IT BACK OCES ITSPASEDLY MEDITATION FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT MIGH NOT SEEM LIKE A SIGNIFICANTOR UNUSUAL PRACTICE OR THAT IT WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT AT ALL BUT REMARKABLY JUST DOING THAT ONCE FOR SEVENTEEN MINUTES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ATTENTIONAL BLINKS THAT PEOPLE WOULD CARRY OUT IN OTHER WORDS THEIR FOCUS GOT BETTER IN A NEAR PERMANENT WAY WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TRAINING THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PRACTICE OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF VISUAL INFORMATION COMING IN AND LEARNING TO PAY ATTENTION TO ONE'S INTERNAL STATE WHEN WE CALL INTERRECEPTION THAT ALLOW THEM IN AWARENESS SUCH THAT WHEN THEY NEEDED TO LOOK FOR VISUAL TARGETS WHEN THEY NEED TO FOCUS UNMULTIBLE THINGS IN SEQUINCE THEY DIDN'T EXPERIENTES THE SAME NUMBER OF ATTENTIONAL BLINKS AND I SHOULD MENTION NOT INCIDENTALLY AS PEOPLE AGE AND THEIR WORKING MEMORY GETS WORKS AND THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS GETS WORSE THE NUMBER OF ATTENTIONAL BLINKS THAT THEY CARRY OUT GOES UP AND THERE ARE NOW STUDIES EXPLORING WHETHER NOT THE SIMPLE MEDITATION LIKE PRACTICE OF FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES OR SO OF SITTING AND JUST QUIETLY RESTING AND PAYING ATTENTIONAL ONES BREATHING AND INTERNAL STATE CAN ALSO OFFSET SOME OF THAT AGE RELATED WHAT IS CALLED COGNITIVE DECLINE SO WHAT THESE DATA TELL ME IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU ARE A CHILD OR YOU'REAN ADULT WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE EIGHTY ETY OR NOT WHETHER NOT YOUR EXPERIENCING AGE RELATED COGNIVE DECLINE OR YOU WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO AVOID AGE RELATED COGNIVE TO CLIME A SIMPLE PRACTICE OF TAKING SEVENTEEN MINUTES SITTING AND PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR INTERNAL STATE JUST INTERROCEPTING REGISTERING YOUR BREATHING REGISTERING THE CONTACT OF YOUR SKIN WITH WHATEVER SURFACE HURON CAN FOREVER REWIRE YOUR BRAIN TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND BETTER AND POSSIBLY EVEN OFFSET SOME OF THAT AGE RELATED ATTENTIONAL DRIFT NOW I DON'T EXPECT ANYONE TO START MEDITATING REGULARLY I DON'T EXPECT ANY ONE TO DO ANYTHING THEY DON'T WANT TO DO BUT I THINK MOST OF US COULD HANDLE ONE MEDITATIONS SESSION OF SEVENTEEN MINUTES OR SO AND SO IF EVER THERE WAS A TOOL THAT STOOD TO REWIRE OUR ATTENTIONAL CIRCUITRY IN A POWERFUL WAY THIS SEEMS TO BE IT AND IN ADDITION THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN PANORAMIC VISION TO DILATE OUR GAZE THIS SO CALLED OPEN MONITERING THAT ALLOWS THE BRAIN TO FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT IT CAN DETECT MORE INFORMATION FASTER THAT'S A POWERFUL TOOL IS WELL AND THE BEAUTY OF THAT TOOL IS THAT IT WORKS THE FIRST TIME AND IT WORKS EVERY TIME NOW HOW EXACTLY IT WORKS IS A LITTLE BIT ON CLEAR IS IT FOR INSTANCE ORCHUSTRATING THIS SYNCHRANY OR ASYNCHRANY BETWEEN THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IN THE TASK RELATED NETWORKS WE DON'T KNOW THOSE STUDIES HAVE NOT YET BEEN CARRIED OUT NONE THE LESS THE EFFECTS ARE SIGNIFICANT THEY ARE LONG LASTING AND THEY APPEAR TO EXIST AFTER JUST ONE SEPTION OF THIS QUIET SEVENTEEN MINUTE IN TERROCEPTION WHICH TO ME MAKES IT SEEM LIKE A VERY WORTH WHILE THING TO DO FOR EVERYBODY SO WE JUST TALKD ABOUT ATTENTIONAL BLINKS WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY BLINKS OF THINKING IT'S YOUR MIND SHUTTING OFF FOR A MOMENT AND MISSING INFORMATION NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT ACTUAL BLINKS THE SORT THAT YOU DO WITH YOUR EYELIDS THIS MIGHT COME ACROSS THO SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS BUT YOU CAN DO FAST WHAT AR CALLED SPONTANEOUS BLINKS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS CORDINATED BETWEEN THE TWO EYES OR YOU CAN DO LONG BLINKS LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT YOU DO ONE VERY LONG BLINK AND I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS YOU WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP ATNIGHT YOU ARE SHUTTING YOUR EYELIDS AND YOU ARE LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION COMING IN END YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME STARTS TO DRIFT AS YOU GO INTO SLEEP YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME CHANGES FROM VERY FAST AT ONE MOMENT TO VERY SLOW MEANING THE FRAME RATE AT WHICH YOU ARE ANALYZING INFORMATION DREAMING AT CETERA IS VARIABLE WHEN YOU ARE IN SLEEP SOMETIMES ITS VERY FAST MEANING YOU EXPERIENCE THINGS IN SLOW MOTION SOMETIMES ITS VERY FAST IN WAKING TOO YOU ARE EXPERIENCE OF TIME CAN SOMETIMES BE VERY FAST SOMETIMES BE VERY SLOW TYPICALLY THE MORE ALERT YOU ARE THE HIGHER THE FRAME RATE YOUR THIN SLICING YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU'VE PROBABLY HAVE THIS HAPPEN IF YOU ARE EVER VERY STRESSED AND YOUR WAITING FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY IT SEEMS LIKE IT TAKES FOR EVER BECAUSE YOUR FRAME RATE IS HIGHER YOUR ANALYZING TIME MORE FINELY CONVERSELY IF YOU ARE VERY RELAXED OR EVEN SLEEPY YOU WAKE UP AND YOU HAVE TO THING THAT ALL THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO IT WILL EEM LIKE THE WORLD IS GOING BY VERY VERY FAST AND THAT YOU ARE MOVING VERY SLOW TIME IS GOING AT THE SAME RATE BUT YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME IS WHAT'S CHANGED BELIEVE IT OR NOT YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME IS ALSO CHANGED ON A RAPID BASIS MOMENT A MOMENT BASIS BY HOW OFTEN YOU BLINK THIS IS A WELL ESTABLISHED LITERATURE IN THE WORLD OF NARROW SCIENCE THAT UNLIKE THE LITERATURE AND CLAIMS ABOUT BLINKING AND SO SIAPATHY WHICH HAVE NO BASIS THE SCIENCE OF BLINKING AS IT RELATES THE TIME PERCEPTION HAS SOME VERY GOOD DATA TO SUPPORT IT I WANT ED JUST EMPASIZE ONE STUDY IN PARTICULAR WHICH IS QUITE APPROPRIATELY TITLED TIME DILATES AFTER SPONTANEOUS BLINKING THIS IS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN CURRENT BIOLOGY THE FIRST AUTHOR IS TERAHOON T ARE H YOU AND E TO WONDERFUL PAPER THEY EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FLUCTUATIONS IN TIMING AND BLINKING AND TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT RIGHT AFTER BLINKS WE RESET ARE PERCEPTION OF TIME OK SO BLINKS IN THAT SENSE ARE A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE CURTAIN COMING DOWN ON A SCENE BETWEEN SCENES IN A PLAY OR TAKES IN A MOVY YOU KNOW WHEN THEY CLAP THE CLAP THING THEY START AT TAKE YOU KNOW WHAT DERE THEY SAY O ACTION AND THEN AT THE END THEY DO THING AND THE CLICKET DOWN AND THEY SAY IT'S A TAKE THAT'S ONE TAKE WHEN YOU BLINK IT'S A TAKE OHE NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING AND WILL IMMEDIATELY MAKE SENSE TO YOU AS TO WY THIS IS INPORTANT IS THAT THE RATE OF BLINKING IS CONTROLD BY DOPAMY SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT DOPAMINES CONTROLLING ATTENTION BLINKS RELATE TO ATTENTION IN FOCUS AND THEREFORE THE DOPAMINE AND BLINKING SYSTEM IS ONE WAY THAT YOU CONSTANTLY MODULATE AND UPDATE YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME AND FORTUNATELY IT'S ALSO ONE THAT YOU CON CONTROL SO THE BASIC TAKE AWAY OF THE STUDY WAS THAT BLINKING CONTROLS TIME PERCEPTION BUT ALSO THAT LEVELS OF DOPAMINE CAN ALTER YOUR SENSE OF TIME AND STAY WITH ME HERE AND THAT BLINKING AND DOPAMINE ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO CONTROL YOUR ATTENION WHEN DOPAMIE LEVELS GO UP PEOPLE TEND TO OVERESTIMATE HOW LONG SOMETHING LASTED WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE PROCESSING TIME MORE FINELY IT'S SLOW MOTION MODE WHEN DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE LOWER THEY TEND TO UNDERESTIMATE TIME INTERVALS LET'S REMEMBER BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WHAT'S GOING ON IN PEOPLE WITH EIGHDITY THEY ARE NOT GOOD AT MANAGING THEIR TIME THEY TEND TO RUN LATE OR THEY ARE DISORGANIZED THEY ARE NOT JUST DISORGANIZED IN SPACE MEANING IN THE PHYSICAL SPACE AROUND THEM THEY ARE DISORGANIZED IN TIME THEIR DOPAMINE IS LOW WE KNOW THAT AS WELL AND SO THEY ARE UNDERESTIMATING TIME INTERVALS AND SO IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT THEY WOULD BE LATE IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT THEY WOULD LOSE TRACK OF TIME OR THE ABILITY TO FOCUS THIS IS REALLY EXCITING BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT CHILDREN WITH AGHTY T ADULTS WITH GHTY HTY OR PEOPLE WITH NORMAL LEVELS OF FOCUS THAT WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS CAN DO SO THROUGH A TRAINING THAT INVOLVES LEARNING HOW OFTEN TO BLINK AND WHEN AND HOW TO KEEP THEIR VISUAL FOCUS ON A GIVEN TARGET AND IT TURNS OUT THIS STUDY IS ACTUALLY BEEN DONE THERE'S A STUDY AGAIN I'LL LINK TO THE STUDY ENTITLED IMPROVEMENT OF ATTENTION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS THROUGH FIXATION FOCUS TRAINING ACTIVITY AND I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL THE DETAILS BUT WHAT THEY FOUND WAS A SHORT PERIOD OF FOCUSING ON A VISUAL TARGET ALLOWED THESE SCHOOL CHILDREN TO GREATLY ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS ON OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION AND A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE EFFECT WAS DUE TO THE WAY THAT THEY WERE CONTROLLING THE SHUTTERS ON THEIR EYES THEIR EYELIDS AND CONTROLLING THEIR BLINKS SO WHAT THEY DID IN THE STUDY IS THATHEY HAD THESE KIDS FOCUSS THEIR VISUAL ATTENTION ON SOME OBJECT THAT WAS RELATIVELY CLOSE LIKE THEIR HAND FOR A MINUTE OR S O WHICH ACTUALLY TAKES SOME EFFORT IF YOU TRY AND DO THAT THEY WERE ALLOWED TO BLINK HOWEVER IT'S KNOWN FROM OTHER WORK THAT IF PEOPLE CAN CONSCIOUSLY OVERRIDE THE DESIRE TO BLINK AT LEAST TO THE POINT WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE DO OR ELSE THEIR EYES WOULE DRY OUT THAT ACTUALLY CAN INCREASE ATTENTION EVEN FURTHER AND THEY HAD CONDITIONS WHERE THEY WOULD LOOK AT A POINT FURTHER ACROSS THE ROOM AND EVEN FURTHER ACROSS THE ROOM IT ONLY TOOK A FEW MINUTES EACH DAY TO DO THIS THIRTY SECONDS IN ONE CONDITIOND OR MAY BE A MINUTE AND THEN AT ANOTHER STATION OF LOOKING A LIBIT FURTHER OUT AN A LIBIT FRTHER OUT HOWEVER THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THIS STUDY THAT IS DEFINITELY WORTH MENTIONING WHICH IS BEFORE THEY DID THIS VISUAL FOCUS TASK OR TRAINING THEY DID A SERIES OF PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS WITH THE KIDS SO THAT THE KIDS COULD SORT OF ELIMINATE OR MOVE OUT SOME OF THEIR DESIRE TO MOVE AND WOULD THEREBY ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO SIT STILL NOW IT'S LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT KIDS NEED A RECESS THEY NEED TIME TO RUN AROUND AND PLAY AND ROLL AROUND DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY DO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SIT STILL AT ALL ADULTS PROBABLY NEED THIS TWO FRANKLY BUT KIDS NEED IT MORE BECAUSE THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL REFLECIVE MOVEMENTS AND AND AS WE SAY CON O RHYTHMIC AN UNDULATING BEHAVIOR IN THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S AN ACTIVE SUPPRESSION AND KIDS HAVE LESS OF THAT CIRCUITRY BUILT UP UNTIL THEY HIT ABOUT AGE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN SO THEY HAD THE KIDS MOVE AROUND A BIT AND THEN DO THIS FOCUS TRAINING THAT BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER TREATMENT THAT'S ACTIVELY USE NOWADAYS IN SCHOOLS FOR KIDS WITH EIGHTY HT BUT ALSO STRYING TO BE USED BY MANY KIDS AND BY PARENTS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR KIDS FOCUSSING AND NOT GOING CRAZY IN THE CAR OR NOT ACTING OUT IN GENERAL AND THAT'S THE PREVALENCE OF THESE SO CALLED FIDGETOR TOYS OR THINGS THAT KIDS CAN DO ACTIVELY AND REPETIVELY IN ORDER TO MOVE OUT SOME OF THEIR A UNDERLYING REVERBATORY ACTIVITY IN THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO WHAT YOU WILL FIND IS THAT SOME KIDS WITH EIGHTY HT ARE NOW GIVEN A RUBBER BAND ON THEIR DESK LITERALY A RUBBER BAN THAT'S ATTACHED TO THEIR DESK AND THEIR ABLE TO PULL ON IT EVEN SNAP IT AGAINST THE DESK IF I DONE THAT WHEN I WAS A KID I THING MY TEACHERS WOULE THROW ME ON A CLASS BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THEY'RE ALLOWING THEM TO DO THIS NOW AS A WAY OF MOVING SOME OF THEIR PHYSICAL ENERGY OUT OR ENGAGE THEIR PHYSICAL ENERGY RATHER AS SUPPOSE TO TRY TO SIT STATUE STILL ALL THE TIME AND ATTEND AND TURNS OUT THAT DOES ENHANCE THESE CHILDREN'S ABILITY TO FOCUS MENTALLY WHEN THEY HAVE SOME PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO ATTEND TO END IT TURNS OUT IT ALSO CAN WORK FOR ADULTS A SHARE WITH YOU A RELATED ANECDOTE BECAUSE THEY ILLUSTRATES THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM I'VE HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO DO A NUMBER OF SURGERIES BRAIN SURGERIES DURING MY CAREER SO ONE THING YOU FIND WHEN YOU D BRAIN SURGERIES THAT THE BRAINS PRETTY SMALL A REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIES THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON AND YOU'RE IN THERE ANDYOURE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC AND THE MORE YOU TRY AND HOLD YOUR HANDS REALLY STEADY THE MORE THEY WANT TO SHAKE RIGHT SO IT'S NOT NATURAL FOR ANY OF OUR LIMBS TO SIT PERFECTLY STILL DEPENN ON HOW MUCH COFFEE YOU'VE HAD HOW WELL RESTED YOU ARE AND YOUR SORT OF BASE LINE LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC ROUSALS SOME OF YOU MAY FIND THAT YOU CAN HOLD OUT YOUR HAND ABSOLUTELY ROCKSOLID OTHERS WILL SHAKE A LOBIT MORE DOESN'T MEAN YOUR NERVOUS IF YOUR SHAKING DOESN'T MEAN YOUR CALM IF YOU'RE STILL WHAT IT RELATES TO IS THE AMOUNT OF WHAT WE CALL PREMOTOR ACTIVITY THE NUMBER OF COMMANDS TO MOVE THAT ARE BEING SENT THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY REVERBATORY ACTIVITY AND IT DOES SEEM THAT KIDS WITH ADIAGETY AND ADULTS WITH ADIATES YE HOVE A LOT OF REREVERBATORY ACTIVITY IN THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S THAT CONSTANT DESIRE TO MOVE IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO SIT STILL AND THEREFORE IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO ATTEND TO HARNESS THEIR ATTENTION WHEN YOU DO A CURGERY AND YOU FIND THAT YOUR HANDS ARE SHAKING WHAT YOU LEARN FROM YOUR MENTORS WHICH I DID AND WHAT WORKS EXTREMELY WELL WHETHER NOT YOU DOING A SURGERY OR NOT IS THAT YOU SIMPLY TAP YOUR FOOT OR YOU BOUNCE YOUR KNEILOBIT WHICH YOU MIGHT THINK WOULD MAKE YOUR HANDSHAKE EVEN MORE BUT PROVIDED THAT IT SUBTLE WHAT IT DOES IT IT IS IT ACTUALLY SHUTTLE SOME OF THE ACTIVITY FROM THOSE PREMOTOR CIRCUITS TO ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY AND THEN YOUARE ABLE TO SIT MUCH MORE STILL WITH YOUR HAND YOU ARE ABLE TO PERFORM THE CURGERY WITH MUCH MORE PRECISION YOU ARE ABLE TO WRITE WITH MUCH BETTER HANDWRITING AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC SPEAKING IF YOU'E EVER TOO NERVOUS THAT'S WHY PACING WHILE YOU PUBLIC SPEAK HELPS IF YOUR NERVOUS THAT'S WHY BOUNCING YOUR KEE BEHIND NEPODIUM WORKS AS WELL THAT'S WHY NODDING YOUR HEAD AND GESTICULATING CAN HELP IT'S NOT A MATTER OF QUOTING QUAT MOVING ENERGY OUT OF THE BODY THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN WHAT IT IS IS YOUARE ENGAGING THOSE PREMOTOR CIRCUITS THAT ARE SENDING THROUGH COMMANDS SINCE I TRYING TO STUFF A BUNCH OF STUFF THROUGH A FUNNEL AND IT CREATES THIS TENSION SO YOUR GIVING IT AN OUTLET FOR THAT NOURAL CIRCUITRY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE SOMETHING SO THAT YOU CAN KEEP OTHER COMPONENTS OF YOUR BODY AND YOUR MENTAL ATTENTION ENGAGED AND LOCKED ON TO SOMETHING WHAT WE CALL FOCUS ONE THING RELATED TO THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF BLINKING AND FOCUS AND TRAINING YOURSELF TO FOCUS AND NOT BLINKING AT CETERA IS THAT MOST ALL OF THE DRUGS RIDDLEIN ATAR ALL AND RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT INCREASE DOPOMINE EVEN COFFEE AND TEA AND OTHER FORMS OF CAFFINE THEY TEND TO MAKE US BLINK LESS AND WHEN WE GET TIRED WE TEND TO BLINK MORE NOW THIS IS SORT OF A DU RIGHT BUT BEING WIDE EYED WITH EXCITEMENT OR FEAR OR WITH YOUR EYES BARELY BEING ABLE TO KEEP THEM OPENG NOW IT SHOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE THAT THESE SHUTTERS ON THE FRONT OF YOUR EYES THEY AREN'T JUST THERE FOR WINKING AND THEY AREN'T JUST THERE FOR COSMATIC PURPOSES THEY ARE THERE TO REGULATE THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION GOING INTO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THERE THERE TO REGULATE HOW LONG YOU ARE BRINGING INFORMATION INTO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IN WHAT BINS HOW WIDELY OR FINELY YOU ARE BEING TIME IS SET BY HOW OFTEN YOU BL INK AND HOW WIDELY OR SPECIFICALLY YOU ARE GRABBING ATTENTION FROM THE VISUAL WORLD IS SET BY WHETHE OR NOT YOUR VIEWING THINGS VERY SPECIFICALLY LIKE A CROSS HER OR THROUGH A SOTOFSTRAW VIEW LIKE THIS OR WHETHER NOT YOU ARE IN THIS PANORAMIC SORT OF WHOLE ENVIRONMENT MODE THIS KIND OF FISHI LANDS OR WIDE ANGLE LANDS MODE AND IN FAIRNESS TO THE PHARMICOLOGY IN THE CIRCUITRY WHILE DOPAMINE AND HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ALERTNESS AND EXCITEMENT TEND TO MAKE US BLINK LESS AND A TEND MORE THERE IS ACTUALLY A STUDY THAT'S LOOKED AT THE OTHER NAUROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND DRUGS AND HOW THOSE RELATE TO BLINKING AND SO THIS WILL ALL BE OBVIOUS BY THE TITLE OF THE PAPER I'M ABOUT TO SHARE WITH YOU THIS IS A PAPER ENTITLED DECREASE SPONTANEOUS I BLINK RATES IN CHRONIC CANABUS USERS EVIDENCE FOR STRIOTA CANABONOI DOPAMINE INTERACTIONS CA I'M NOT CAN IT GO INTO ALL THE DETAILS HERE BUT ONE THING THAT IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING IS THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY H ST USE OR ABUSE CANABUS YOU MIGHT THINK WELL WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT A INCREASE IN DOPAMNE IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S CAN A LEAD TO HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ATTENTION AN THAT'S WHATH THESE PEOPLE IN CHILDREN CRAVE WELL TURNS OUT THAT CANABUS ALSO INCREASES DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION IN THE BRAIN BUT BECAUSE OF THE OTHER CHEMICALS IT INCREASES NAMELY CERATONAN AND SOME COMPONENTS OF THE CANABONOID AND OPIOID SYSTEM IT CREATES THAT KIND OF ALERT BUT MELLO FEEL AND AGAIN HERE IM I'M NOT A PROPONING THIS I PERSLAIM NOT A TEH TE YOUR CANABUS USER JUST NOT MY THING AH AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S HE LEGAL SOME PLACES AND SO YOUHAVE TO DETERMINE THAT FOR YOURSELF IT DOES HAVE MEDICAL PURPOSES AN IN SOME PLACES IT IS LEGAL BUT T C INCREASES DOPAMINE AND INCREASES NOR CHEMICALS THAT CAN ALSO CREATE A STATE OF CALM SO ITS THAT SORT OF MIDDLE GROUND AND THIS PAPER HAS A BEAUTIFUL DEMONSTRATION WHEREBY NOT JUST WILE PEOPLE ARE USING CANABUS BUT DEPENDING ON HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN USING CANABUS ACROSS THEIR LIFE SPAN THE RATES OF I BLINKING CHANGE SO FEW LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING CANABUS ON A REGULAR BASIS EITHER DAILY OR UP O EXCUSE ME WEAKLY OR UP TO DAILY WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN USING CANABUS AT ALL OR HAVE ONLY E EN USING IT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS THEIR RATES OF I BLINKS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING IT CHRONICALLY FOR TEN YEARS ANOTHER ITS PEOPLE WHO USING CANABUS FOR TEN YEARS DON'T BLINK VERY OFTEN AT ALL NOW CANABUS HAS WELL KNOWN EFFECTS INTO PLEADING MEMORY BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ENGAGE THE FOCUS AND BLINKING SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT INCREASES FOCUS SO BASSEY WHAT I AM SAYING IS MAREUANA SEEMS TO INCREASE PEOPLE'S FOCUS BUT THEN THEY CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE FOCUSSING ON SOMETHING I LIKE TO DISCUSTJUS BRIEFLY IS THE SO CALLED INTERRACEPTIVE AWARENESS THAT'S PRESENT IN PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY H D BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN TERACEPTIVE WARENESS IS ONES SENSE OF ONE'S OWN INTERNAL STATE HEART BEAT BREATHING CONTACT OF SKIN WITH A GIVEN SURFACE ET SCETERA FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS THIS HYPOTHESIS THIS IDEA THET PEOPLE WITH EIHTY AH TO WEREN JUST NOT IN TOUCH WITH HOW THEY FELT THAT SOMEHOW THEY WEREN'T REGISTERING ALL THE STEPTHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THEM CHANGES IN HEART RADE AND SO FORTH AND SO THEY WERE BEHAVING IN AWAY THAT WAS DISREGULATED OR APPEAR DISREGULATED AND THAT IF THEY COULD JUST LEARN TO ATTEND TO THEIR INTERNAL STATE BETTER THAT SOMEHOW THEY WOULD FUNCTION BETTER IN THE WORLD NOW BEFORE WE DESCRIBED A PROCESS LITERALLY A SEVENTEEN MINUTE IN TERACEPTIVE EXERCISE THAT DOES SEEM TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN ONE'S ABILITY  TO FOCUS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME HOWEVER IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT THAT WAS DUE TO INCREASING AND TERACEPTIVE AWARENESS PERE SAY IT PROBABLY WASN'T BECAUSE PEOPLE GAIN A MUCH HEIGHTENED OR IMPROVED ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY IN FACT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY PREVENT ONE'S ABILITY TO PAY ATTENTION TO THINGS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD SO WHILE THERE IS BENEFIT TO JUST SITTING THERE AND BEING IN STILLNESS AS THEY SAY OR FOCUSSING A ONE'S BREATHING AN INTERNAL STATE FORSAKE OF THAND ACCESSING INFORMATION IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD A REALLY NICE STUDY CALLD INTERRACEPTIVE AWARENESS IN ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPER ACTIVITY DISORDER EXPLORED WHETHER OR NOT INTERACEPTIVE AWARENESS WAS DIFFERENT IN PEOPLE WITH AHDIT OR DID NOT HAVE AHDYHT AND THE FINDINGS WERE ESSENTIALLY THAT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE THAT PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY AH TY CHILDREN AN ADULT THEY ARE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THEM JUST AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE IS AND THE TYPICAL MEASURE OF INTERACEPTIVE AWARENESS IS ONE'S ABILITY TO COUNT THEIR OWN HEART BEATS THIS IS ACTUALLY CHALLENGING FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS AND VERY EASY FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ATTENTIONAL CAPACITY SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN REALLY FEEL THEIR HEART BEAT WITHOUT TAKING THEIR PULSE OTHER PEOPLE CANNOT AND THESE STUDIES ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO DO YOU ASK PEOPLE TO SIT THERE AND TO COUNT THEIR HEART BEATS IN THEN YOU ARE MONITORING THEIR HEART BEATS AND YOU GET TO GAGE HOW ACCURATE THEY ARE SO IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE OT EIGHTY AH TY ARE IN TOUCH WITH HOW THEY FEEL IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF WHETHER R NOT THEY CAN TAKE THE DEMANDS THAT ARE PLACED UPON THEM AND ENTER A COGNATIVE STATE A MENTAL STATE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION THAN ACCIS AND OTHER ORDS WHETHER NOT THEY CAN FOCUS BUT IT IS ABSOLUTLY WRONG TO THINK THAT THE CHILD THAT'S GETTING UP ALEVEN TIMES DURING A SHORT SIX YOU KNOW SIX MINUTE INTERACTION AT THE TABLE OR WHETHER OR NOT A A CHILD WHO SOMEHOW HAS TO VENTURE OFF EVERY MOMENT OR AN CO ORKER OF YOURS WHOSE IN ADULT WHOSE CONSTANTLY FIDGETING OR MOVING THINGS AROUND THAT SOMEHOW THEY ARE UNAWARE THAT THEY ARE OBLIVIOUS THEY ARE NOT OBLIVIOUS TO HOW THEY FEEL CHANCES ARE THEY AE VERY CHALLENGED IN THE SITUATIONS THAT THEREIN AND THERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO TRY AND REGULATE THEIR ATTENTION SO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT STUDY TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE IT REALLY UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS ABILITY TO CORDINATE THESE TAS DIRECTED NETWORKS AND TO CORDINATE THAT IN THE PROPER WAY WITH THAT DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AND THAT IS A PROCESSES YOU NOW KNOW THAT'S REGULATED EXQUISITELY BY CERTAIN NARROW CHEMICALS AND IN PARTICULAR THE NOR CHEMICLES DOPAMINE NORUPANEFRANT AND CERATONAN AND A FOURTH ONE I'D LIKE TO THROW INTO THE MIXS WHICH IS A SEETO COLLING WHICH IS VERY VITAL FOR COGNATIVE FOCUS SO NOW I WANT TO SWITCH BACK TO TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE DRUGS THAT ARE TYPICALLY USED TO ACCESS THOSE SYSTEMS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE NEW AND EMERGING NON PRESCRIPTION APPROACHES TO INCREASING THE LEVELS OF DOPAMINGE A SEETO COLLIN IN CERATONEAND IN THE BRAIN USING VARIOUS SUPPLEMENT TYPE COMPOUNDS BECAUSE SEVERAL OF THEM ARE SHOWING REALLY REMARKABLE EFFICACY IN EXCELLENT PURE REVIEWED STUDIES SO BEFORE MOVING TO SOME OF THE NEWOR ATYPICAL COMPOUNDS AND THINGS SOLD OVER THE COUNTER I LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY RETURN TO THE CLASSIC DRUGS THAT ARE USED TO TREAT ADIT THESE ARE THE ONES I MENTIONED EARLIER METHEL PENIDATE ALSO CALLED RIDDLAN MODAPHONIL ARMODAPHANIL IS ANOTHER ONE AND ATERAL AGAIN ALL OF THESE WORK BY INCREASING LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AND NORUP AN EFFERON TYPICALLY THEY ARE TAKEN EARLY IND PILFORM OR SOMETIMES IN CAPSAL FORM THE DOSAGES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE VARY ACCORDING TO SEVERITY OF THE CONDITION FOR A GIVEN PERSON AND THE AGE OF THE PERSON THIS IS A COMPLICATED LANDSCAPE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE PHARMOCOLOGY THAT'S BEST FOR THEM SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE EVEN LAYRING LONG OR TIME TO RELEASE RIDDLIN WITH ATARALLANS IN SMALLER DOSES IT CAN GET QUITE COMPLEX OR IT CAN BE QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD IF YOU ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THESE DRUGS AND HOW THEY WORK AND YOUD LIKE TO GET A GLANCE AT A TABLE OF ALL THE RESULTS FROM ALL THE STUDIES OF WHICH THER ARE NOW HUNDREDS THEREIS AN EXCELLENT REVIEW ABOUT THESE DRUGS AND THEIR USE AND THEIR COMPARISON TO SIMILARLY STRUCTURE DRUGS IN PARTICULAR EMDYAMA AND COCANE AND AMPHEDAMINE MEANING STREET EMPHEDAMINE TO REALLY ILLUSTRATE THE SIMILARITIES OF ACTION AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATE WITH LONG TERM USE I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO READ THIS ARTICLE IND FULL I'M HERE SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO READ TESE ARTICLES BUT IN CASE YOU WANT A TON OF INFORMATION THE PAPER IS ESPOSIDO AT ALL FRONTIERS AND BIO SCIENCES IT'S AN EXCELLENT EXCELLENT REVIEW OF THE ENTIRE LITERATURE IT IT IS QUITE LONG I CAN PUT A LINK TO THAT STUDY IN OUR CAPTION AND IT ESSENTIALLY DESCRIBES ALL THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE PURE REVIEWED AND PUBLISHED AND IT REFERS TO THESE DRUGS IN AN INTERESTING WAY IT DOESN'T JUST REFER THESE DRUGS AS FOR TREATMENT OF EIGHTIEIGHTIAT ACTUL REFERS TO THEM USING LANGUAGE THAT ORDINARILY IAM NOT VERY FOND OF BUT I'LL AGREE TO HER WHICH IS SO CALLED SMART DRUGS OR NEUTROPICS IT ALSO COVERS KAFFINE WHICH AGAIN AS I MENTION EARLIER INCREASES DOPEMINE NOR UP AN EFFRAN AND TO SOME EXTENT SERTONAN BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS REVIEW SO MUCH IS THAT IN PUTTING THESE DRUGS OF ABUSE MATHAMFEDOMING AND COCAINE RIGHT ALONGSIDE THESE DRUGS LIKE RIDDLIN AND ATER ALL AND ALSO KAFFINE WE START TO REALIZE THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DRUGS OF ABUSE AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DRUGS OF TREATMENT IS ACTUALLY VERY FINE AND SOMETIMES EVEN A BLURRY LINE AND IN THINKING ABOUT WHETHER NOT ONE WANTS TO USE THESE PESCRIPTION N IMSIDE PRESCRIPTION NOT DRUGS OF USE BUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR TREATMENT OF ONE'S OWN ATTENTIONAL CAPACITY I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ALL CARRY MORE O LESS THE SAME SIDE EFFECTS THE ONE EXCEPTION BEING KAFFINE CKAFFINE SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE ANXIETY IF YOU INJUST TOO MUCH OF IT IN SOMNIA IF YOU DRINK IT TOO LATE IN THE DAY BUT TYPICALLY IT WILL NOT CAUSE THE MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS OF THE OTHER DRUGS SUCH AS HIGH PROPENSITY FOR ADDICTION AND ABUSE AMFEDAMINES OF ANY KIND AS WELL AS COCAINE CAN CAUSE SECTUAL SIDE EFFECTS BECAUSE THEIR VAZO CONSTRICTORS SO A YOU MEN HAVE TROUBLE ACHIEVING ERECTION A THERE CAN OFTEN BE THE INTENSE DESIRE OR LEBIDO A FOR SACS BUT IN INABILITY TO ACTUALLY PERFORM SO THAT'S AN ISSUE WITH ANY KIND OF STIMULANT SO THESE DRUGS ARE NOT WITHOUT THEIR CONSEQUENCES IN ADDITION AND HERE I LUMP KAFFINE BACK INTO THE INTO THE MIX IN ADDITION THEY ALMOST ALL CARRY CARDIACAFFECTS RIGHT THE INCREASE HEARTRATE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AFFECTS ON CONSTRICTION OF BLOOD VESSELS AND ARTERIES AND VEINS AND SO FORTH IN WAYS THAT CAN CREATE CARDEVASCULAR PROBLEMS NOW KAFFINE IS A BIT OF A COMPLICATED ONE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON A PODCAST LONG AGO BUT I'LL JUST REMIND YOU THAT IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU ARE KAFFINE ADAPTED IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU ARE USED TO DRINKING KAFFINE THEN THE INGESTION OF KAFFINE MOST OFTEN WILL CAUSE VAS OF DILATION OF ACTUALLY ALLOW MORE BLOOD FLOW THROUGH HOWEVER IF YOU ARE NOT KAFFINE ADAPTED IT WILL CAUSIES VAS O CONSTRICPTION DUE TO AN INCREASED STRESS RESPONSE SO IF YOUR FAMILIAR WITH KAFFINE KAFFINE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A RELAXATION RESPONSE OF THE YOU DURINK ENOUGH OF IT IT WILL MAKE YOU AMPED UP THESE OTHER DRUGS ALMOST ALWAYS LEAD TO TESE O CONSTRICTION INCREASED HART RATE DILATION OF THE PUPILS LESS BLINKING HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ATTENTION WHICH LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE STRESS AND AT ITS EXTREMES LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE EFFECTS OF STREET DRUGS LIKE COCAN AN AND FEDAMINE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DOPENING THE RELEASED IN THE BRAIN PEOPLE TEND TO CRAVE THAT STATE OVER AND OVER AND YET WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT USE ARE ABLE TO GET LESS AND LESS OF THAT UPHORIC FEELING OR THAT REALL REALLY FOCUSED FEELINGS O ONE THING THAT'S BEING EXPLORED QUITE EXTENSIVELY NOW IN THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY H T ARE DRUG SCEDULS WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE ATERALL EVERY DA OR EVERY OTHER DAY WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD TAKE IT ONLY EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WHETHER R NOT YOUNG CHILDREN CAN TAKE IT JUST A FEW TIMES END ENGAGE IN BEHAVIORAL TRAINING OF THE SORT THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHERE THEY'RE DOING MAYBE IT'S A SEVENTEEN MINUTE MEDITATION TYPE EXERCISE BUT MORE LIKELY IT WOULD BE THE MOVEMENT FOLLOWED BY THE VISUAL FOCUSSING CAUSE THAT'S ONLY DONE FOR TWENTY OR THIRDY OR SIXTY SECONDS WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT WELL IN A CHEMICALLY INHANC STATE YOUR BRAIN IS MORE PLASTIC THE CIRCUITS ARE ABLE TO MODIFY AND LEARN BETTER THAT'S THE OPTIMAL TIME TO ENGAGE IN FOCUS IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY SO JUST TAKING ADROG AND EXPECTING FOCUS TO JUST WORK AT ANY POINT AND BE ABLE TO TURN FOCUS ON AND OFF AT WILL THAT'S AN UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION RIGHT MORE LIKELY THE BEST USE OF THINGS LIKE ATER ALL MODAPHINIL ARMODAPHINIL AND RIDDLIN IS GOING TO BE TO COMBINE THOSE TREATMENTS WITH BEHAVIORAL EXERCISES THAT ACTIVELY ENGAGED THE VERY CIRCUITS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TRAIN UP AND ENHANCE AND THEN PERHAPS ON A HIGHLIGHT PERHAPS TAPERING OFF THOSE DRUGS SO THAT THEN ONE CAN USE THOSE CIRCUTS WITHOUT ANY NEED FOR CHEMICAL INTERVENTION SO DESPITE ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE I THING IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE CONSUMPTION OF OMEGOTHRY FATIACIDS CAN POSITIVELY MODULAE THE SYSTEMS FOR ATTENTION AND FOCUS SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW MUCH E P A HOW MUCH D A H A DOES THAT DIFFER FOR A WHAT'S HELPFUL FOR DEPRESSION ET CETERA AN ACTUALLY IT DOES DIFFER IN REVIEWING THE STUDIES FOR THIS IT APPEARS THAT A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF D H A TURNS OUT TO BE AN IMPORTANT INFLECTION POINT SO TYPICALLY FICIAL OILS OR OTHER SOURCES OF OMEGATHRIES WILL HAVE D H A ND E P A AN TYPICALLY IT'S THE E P A THAT'S HARDER TO GET AT SUFFICIENT LEVELS MEANING OG TO TAKE QUITE A LOT OF FICIOIL IN ORDER TO GET ABOVE THAT ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAM OR TWO THOUSAND MILIGRAM THRESHOLD TO IMPROVE MOOD AND OTHER FUNCTIONS BUT FORSAKE OF ATTENTION THERE ARE TEN STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THIS IN DETAIL AND WHILE THE E P  COMPONENT IS IMPORTANT THE MOST CONVINCING STUDIES POINT TO THE FACT THAT GETTING ABOVE THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DA OF D H  IS REALLY WHERE YOU STAR TO SEE THE ATTENTIONAL EFFECTS NOW FORTUNATELY IF YOU'RE GETTING SUFFICIENT E P A FOR SAKE OF MOOD AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS ALMOST WITHOUT QUESTION YOU'RE GETTING THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS ARE MORE OF D H  SO THAT USUALLY CHECKS THAT BOX JUST FINE WHICH INTERESTING IS THAT THERE'S ANOTHER COMPOUND PHOSPHODITAL STEERING THAT HAS BEEN EXPLORED FOR ITS CAPACITY TO IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF  D H D AGAIN I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY DIRECT WAY BUT RATHER AN A MODULATORY WAY BUT IT APPEARS THAT PHOSPHODITAL STERING TAKEN FOR TWO MONTHS FOR TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY WAS ABLE TO REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS OF EIGHTY EIGHT IN CHILDREN IT HAS NOT BEEN LOOKED AT IN ADULTS YET AS AT LEAST AS FAR AS I KNOW BUT THAT THIS EFFECT WAS GREATLY ENHANCED BY THE CONSUMPTION OF OMEGA THREE FATIACIDS SO NOW ARE STRYING TO SEE SYNARGISTIC EFFECTS OF OMEGATHREE FATIACIDS AND PHOSPHODIDAL STERING AGAIN THAT WAS TWO HUNDRED MILEGRAMS PER DAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOLD OVER THE COUNTER IN CAPSIL FORM AT LEAST IN THE U S A THERE WERE TWO STUDIES BOTH WERE DOUBLE BLIND STUDIES I CARRIED OUT FOR ANY ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO SIX MONTHS ON BOTH A BOYS AND GIRLS AND IT REALLY WAS BOYS AN GIRLS NOT MEN AND WOMEN THIS WAS KIDS ON AGE ONE TO SIX OR SEVEN TO TWELVE AND A IT WAS A FAIRLY LARGE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS O A HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN SUBJECTS IN ONE CASE IN THIRTY SIX IN THE OTHER THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT GETTING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF EPIES IN PARTICULAR THIS THREE HUNDRED MELEGRAM THRESHOLD OF T H A PLUS  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN IT AND ITS RIGHT FOR YOU TWO UNDRED MILEGRAMS OF PHOSPHODITAL STEERING CAN BE AN IMPORTANT AUGMENT FOR IMPROVING THE SYMPTOMS OF EIGHTY HT YOU'LL ALSO FIND LITERATURE OUT THERE AND MANY CLAIMS ABOUT SO CALLED GINCO BILL BOA WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE MINOR EFFECTS IN IMPROVING THE SYMPTOMS OF EIGHTY GHT NOT NEARLY AS EFFECTIVE AS RIDDLIN AND ADERAL GINKO BELBOA IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR MANY PEOPLE I AM ONE SUCH PERSON I DON'T HAVE EGHTY HT BUT WHEN I TAKEN GINCO EVEN AT VERY LODOSES I GET ABSOLUTELY SPLITTING HEADACHES SOME PEOPLE DO NOT EXPERIENCE THOSE HEADACHES BUT IT'S KNOWN TO HAVE VERY POTENT VASO CONSTRICTIVE INVAYS OF DILATING PROPERTIES THAT VERY DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU TOOK THE COMPOUND SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT EXPLORING GINKO BEL BOA AND YOU WILL SEE ALOT O CLAIMS ABOUT GINKOBOLBOA FOR ATTENSION IN EIGHTY GHT DEFILING TAKE THE A VASO DILATION VAS OF CONSTRICTION HEADACHE ISSUE INTO CONSIDERATION SO I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE DRUG MODAPHINIL AND THE CLOSELY RELATED DRUG ARMODAPHANL THAT'S A R MODAPHINEL BECAUSE MODAHINIL AND ARMODAPHANIL ARE GAINING POPULARITY OUT THERE BOTH FOR TREATMENT OF EIGHTY EGHT AND NARCILEPSY BUT ALSO FOR COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO STAY AWAKE LONG PERIODS OF TIMES SO ITS ACTIVELY USED IN THE MILITARY BY FIRST RESPONDERS ITS A GAINING POPULARITY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND PEOPLE ARE USING IT MORE ANDMORE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ADARAL AND RIDDLIN AND EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF COFFEE IT DOES INCREASE FOCUS AND TO A DRAMATIC EXTENT MODAPHINIL TO TYPICALLY WAS VERY EXPENSIVE YOU N I DON'T KNOW IF ITS STILL THIS EXPENSIVE BUT WHEN ONE HAS A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT IT COULD STILL COST AS MUCH AS EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS EVEN A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH ARMODAPHINIL IS A FAR LESS EXPENSIVE VERSION THAT CHEMICALLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN MODAPHANIL REGARDLESS APPRICE PEOPLE ARE TAKING MODAPHANON ARMODAPHANIL WHEN I EMPHASIZE THAT UNLIKE RIDDLIN AND ATERAL MODAPHINI N ARMODAPHANIL ARE WEK DOPOMINE REUPTAKEIN HIBITERS AND THAT'S HOW THEY LEAD TO INCREASES IN DOPOMINE SO WHEREAS RIDDLIN AND ATERAL AMPEDAMIN IN COCANE LY TO BIG INCREASES IN DOPOMINE ALSO THREUG REUPTAKE MECHANISMS AND SO FORTH MODAPHINIL IS IS A WEAKER DOPOMIN REUPTAKE STIMULATOR AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT LEAVES MORE DOPOMINE AROUND TO BE ACTIVE AT THE SYNAPS THAT THE GAPS BETWEEN NURONS HOWEVER IT ALSO ACTIVATES OTHER SYSTEMS IT ACTS ON THE ERECON SYSTEM WHICH IS ACTUALLY A PEPTIDE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE EPISODE ON HUNGER BECAUSE IT REGULATES HUNGER AND APPETITE AND IT REGULATES SLEEPINESS AND FEELINGS OF SLEEPINESS IN FACT THE INSCUSE ME ERECON ALSO CALLED HYPOCRETEN SYSTEM THE ERECTS AN HYPOCRETEN SYSTEM IS WHAT'S DISRUPTED IN NARCILEPSY THAT WAS THE IMPORTANT DISCOVERY OF MY COLLEAGUES EMMANUAL MIGNO AND SAGIN ACHINO AT STAMFORD SOME YEARS AGO THEY IDENTIFIED THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF NARCALEPSY AND ITS A DESRUPTION IN THE SO RECIN HYPROCRETEN SYSTEM AND MODAPHANIL IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY TREATMENTS FOR NARCILEPSY IT ALSO HAS THESE OTHER EFFECTS ON THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM AND ON THE NORUP AN EFFERENT SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T LEAD TO QUITE AS INTENSE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AND ARAUSAL AND POCUS IT DOES HAVE THE PROPERTY OF RAISING LEVELS OF ATTENTION AND POCUS AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE USING IT SO IT'S A SOMEWHAT MILDER FORM OF ATERAL ARMODAPHANIL FOR SOME PEOPLE WORKS AS WELL AS MODAPHANIN AS I MENGIBE FOR ITS MUCH LOWER COST FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT DOESN'T I HAVE AN EXPERIENCE MEANING I DO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THAT I'LL SHARE WITH YOU WITH ARMODAPANIL FEW YEARS AGO I WAS SUFFERING FROM JETLAG REALLY TARIBLY AND I WAS TRAVELING OVERSEES I WENT TO A MEETING TO GIVE A TALK I TOOK HALF OF THE PRESCRIBED DOSE OF ARMODAPHNIL IT WAS PRESCRIBED TO ME I TOOK THAT HAPHDOSE AND I GAVE MY LECTURE AND THEN I STATE AROUND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND THEN FOUR HOURS LATER A FRIEND OF MINE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TALKING FOR FOUR AND A HALF HOURS AND A THERE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE STILL HERE LIKELY THERE WERE STILL A FEW PEOPLE BE A LOT WEIRDER IF THE ROOM WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY SINCE IT WASN'T BEING RECORDED SO I HAVE FIRST TANKNOWLEDGE OF THE SORTS OF COGNIVE AFFECTS THAT IT CAN CREATE I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN THAT STATE FOR SAKE OF STUDYING OR LEARNING OR FOR DOING THIS PODCAS FOR INSTANCE AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT TO DAY ALL I'VE INJUSTED IS SOME COFFEI AND SOME ERBOMATETE AND SOME WATER I AM NOT ON ANY OF THE COMPOUNDS THAT IHAVE DESCRIBED DURING THE COURSE OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU MIGHT ASK WHY I TOOK HALF THE RECOMMENDED DOSE OF ARMODAPHANL AND THE REASON IS THAT I'M SOMEBODY WHOSE FAIRLY HYPER SENSITIVE TO MEDICATION OF ANY KIND WHAT YOU FIND IF YOU LOOK IN THE LITERATURE IS THAT ABOUT FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE ARE HYPER HYPER SENSITIVE TO MEDICATION THEY REQUIRE FAR LOWER DOSES OF ANY MEDICATION THAN OTHER PEOPLE IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME EFFECTS I'M SOMEBODY THAT I THINK IS OR MODEST A HYPER IF THAT A SORT OF OXYGMERONIC STATEMENT BUT A MODEST HYPER SENSITIVITY TO MEDICATION SO I AVE ALMOST ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO GET BY ON TAKING LESS OF WHATEVER WAS PRESCRIBED FOR ME A AND FEEL JUST FINE OR IN THIS CASE TO FEEL LIKE IT WAS STILL TOO MUCH TURNED OUT THAT THE RIGHT DOSE OF ARMODALPHANO FOR ME WAS ZERO MELIGRAMS NOW YOU MAY NOTICE THAT I HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH ABOUT A CEDO COLING A SEDO COALING IS A NURRO TRANSMITTER THAT AT THE NURON TO MUSCLE CONNECTIONS THAT SO CALLED NURO MUSCULAR JUNCTIONS IS INVOLVED IN GENERING MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS OF ALL KINDS FOR ALL MOVEMENTS A SEDO COLING IS ALSO RELEASED FROM TWO SITES IN THE BRAIN SO LITOBITOM NOMINCLATURE HERE AGAIN FEEL FREE TO IGNORE THE NOMINCLATURE BUT THERE IS A COLLECTION OF NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN STEM THAT SEND PROJECTIONS FORWARD COME LIKE A SPRINKLER SYSTEM THAT'S VERY DIFFUSE TO RELEASE ASEDO COALING AND THOSE NURONS A RESIDE IN AN AREA OR A STRUCTURE THAT'S CALLED THE PEDUNCULO PONTINUCLEUS THE P P EN AND THEN THERE'S A SEPARA COLLECTION OF NURONS IN THE BAZIL FOR BRAIN CALLED UNIMAGINATIVELY NUCLEUS BASALUS THE NUCLEUS AT THE BASE AND THEY ALSO COSE THE BRAIN WITH A SEDO COALING BUT IN A MUCH MORE SPECIFIC WAY SO ONE IS SORT LIKE A SPRINKLER SYSTEM AND THE OTHER ONE IS MORE LIKE A FIRE HOSE TO A PARTICULAR LOCATION IN THOSE TO SOURCES OF ASEDO COALING COLLABORATE TO ACTOF ATE PARTICULAR LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN AND REALLY BRING ABOUT A TREMENDOUS DEGREE OF FOCAS TO WHATEVER IS HAPPENING AT THOSE PARTICULAR SYNNAPSES SO TO BE A FOCUS ON VISUAL INFORMATION OR AUDITORY INFORMATION IF YOU ARE LISTENING CLOSELY TO WHAT I AM SAYING RIGHT NOW YOU JUST HEARD CLOSELY STEP OUT FROM THE REST OF MY SENTENCE NO DOUBT THERE WAS A SETO COALING RELEASED AT THE SITES IN YOUR BRAIN WHERE THE NURONS THAT REPRESENT YORK RECOGNITION OF THE WORD CLOSELY OCCURRED OCHI SO NOW YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE IN YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING AND HOPFULLY A PICTURE IN YOUR MIND OF HOW ALL THIS IS WORKING NOT SURPRISINGLY THEN DRUGS THAT INCREASE COALIN URGIC OR A SETO COLING TRANSMISSION WILL INCREASE FOCUS AND COGNITION ONE SUCH COMPOUND IS SO CALLED ALPHAG P C WHICH IS A FORM OF COLING AND INCREASES A SEATO COLING TRANSMISSION DOSAGES AS HIGH AS TWELVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY WHICH IS A VERY HIGHDOSAGE SPREAD TYPICALLY ITS THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO OFFSET SOME OF THE AFFECTS OF AGRELA COGNIVE DECLINE IMPROVE COGNIVE FUNCTIONING PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE AGRELA COGNIVE DECLINE THAT'S A VERY HIGH DOSE TYPICALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE USING ALPHAG P C TO STUDY OR TO ENHANCE LEARNING OF ANY KIND THEY WILL TAKE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS THAT'S MORE TYPICAL AGAIN YOU HAVE TO CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR HVE TO DECIDE IF THE SAFETY MARGINS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR YOU OBVIOUSLY ON YOU'LL WANT TO CHECK THAT OUT BUT ALPHAG P C IS EFFECTIVE IN CREATING MORE FOCUS BY WAY OF THIS COLINURGIC SYSTEM AT STIMULATES CULL A SEETOCALLING RELEASES FROM BOTH OF THOSE LIC LOCATIONS THE P P N IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN AND NUCLESPISALS IN THE FRONT OF THE BRAIN THERE ARE TOO OTHER OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUNDS THAT ARE IN ACTIVE USE OUT THERE FOR TREATMENT OF AGTY HT AND IN USE FOR SIMPLY TRYING TO IMPROVE FOCUS AND THE FIRST ONE IS ELTYROSINE ITS IN MENOACID THAT ACTS AS A PRECURSOR TOO THE NROMODULATOR DOPOMINE AND NOW KNOWING EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT DOPOMINE ATTENTION AND THE CIRCUITS INVOLVED IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE AS TO WHY PEOPLE ARE EXPLORING THE USE OF ELTIRASINE FOR THAT PURPOS ELTYRICINE DOES LEAD TO INCREASES IN DOPOMINE THEY ARE FAIRLY LONG LIVED AND ELTYRISINE CAN IMPROVE ONE'S ABILITY TO FOCUS HOWEVER THE DOSAGING CAN BE VERY TRICKY TO DIALIN SOMETIMES IT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL TOO UPHORIC OR TOO GITTERY OR TOO ALERT THAT THEY ARE THEN UNABLE TO FOCUS WELL SO THE DOSAGE RANGES ARE HUGE YOU SEE EVIDENCE FOR A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS ALL THE WAY UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS IT SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOULD BE APPROACHED WITH CAUTION ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE ANY KIND OF UNDERLYING PSYCH PSYCHIATRIC OR MO DISORDER BECAUSE DISREGULATION OF THE DOPOMING SYSTEM IS YOUR CENTRAL TO MANY OF THE MO DISORDER SUCH AS DEPRESSION BUT ALSO ESPECIALLY MANIA MANIA BY PULAR DISORDER SKIS A PRANIA THINGS OF THAT SORT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOULD BE APPROACHED WITH CAUTION NONE THE LESS IN EXPLORING WHAT'S OUT THERE AND EVEN SOME STUDIES ON LINE THAT WERE DONE EITHER ANIMAL STUDIES ARE HUMAN STUDIES IT'S CLEAR THAT TELTYROCINE IS BEING EXPLORED FOR THAT PURPOS AS IS P E A AND FENAL ATHELAMINE WHICH IS A AESSENTIALLY P E A BUT SOME RELATED COMPOUNDS THAT SO THERE'S A WHOLE CLASS OF DOPAM AN NERGIC OR DOPAMIAN STIMULATING SUPPLEMENTS THAT PEOPLE ARE USING TO TRY AND GET THEIR DOPOMINE LEVELS UP AND AGAIN IT'S A IT'S KIND OF A FINE LINE BETWEEN A TOO LITTLE ENOPH AND TOO MUCH IF YOU WANT OF IT GET THE LITERATURE ON THOSE TO COMPOUNDS THEREI WILL REFER TO ON THIS GREAT WEP SITE AEXAMINE DOT CALM I'M JUST AS IT SOUNDS AND YOU CAN PUT IN ELTYROSINE OR P E A AND YOU CAN GET THE DETAILS ON THAT BUT A HILY RECOMMEND ALSO GOING TO THEIR SECTION ON EHD H T TO SEE HOW THOSE PARTICULAR COMMENT ONS RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO T H T AND COGNIV FOCUS AND LASPANOT LEAST IN TERMS OF THESE DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS I DO ANT TO MENTION THE RACOTAMS THESE ARE SOMEWHAT ESOTERIC AND PROBABLY MOST OF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THEM BUT SOME OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEM AND THEY ARE BECOMING MORE POPULAR THEY GO BY NAMES LIKE NEW PEPT AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THE RACITAMS ARE ILLEGAL IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES THEY ARE GRAY MARKET IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEY ARE SOLD OVER THE COUNTER IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE U S SO THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MARGINS FOR SAFETY OU DEFINITELY NEED TO CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR SPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE AHTY H T BUT NEW PEPPT HAS BEEN SHOWN WHEN TAKEN YOU KNOW IT TEN MILEGRAMS TWICE DAILY CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SOME OF THE OTHER RACITAMS WHAT IS NEWPEP NEWPEPED TAPS INTO THE COLONERGIC SYSTEM THE US SEATOF COLING SYSTEM AND WAYS VERY SIMILAR TO ALPHIG P C BUT SEEMS TO HAVE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER AFFINITY FOR SOME OF THE RECEPTORS INVOLVED AND CAN LEAD TO THOSE HEIGHTENED STATES OF COGNIVE CAPACITY AND THERE ARE THEE STUDIES ONE IN PARTICULAR OM COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF NEWPEPPED IN PRACITAM AND THE TREATMENT OF PATIONS WITH MILE COGNIVE DISORDERS AND BRAIN DISEASE OF VASCULAR AND TRAMATIC ORIGIN THAT'S A MOUTHFUL WHAT THIS STUDY BASICALLY POINTS TO IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING SOME DEGREE OF INABILITY TO FOCUS DU TO PRIOR CONCUSSION OR SOME VASCULAR EVENT A STROGUE OR SCHEMI OF ANY CINE BECAUSE NERONS NEED BLOOD WHEN THE BLOOD SUPPLY IS CUT OFTEN ERONS OR WHEN THERE'S A BLEED IN THE BRAIN SUBSEQUENT TO THAT OFTEN THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING FOCUS THIS VERY COMMON FOR PEOPLE HAVE DONE SPORTS WHERE THERE'S LOT OF RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER WITH YOUR HEAD LIKE RUGBY FOOTBALL A HAKI AN SO FORTH BUT ALSO PEOPLE OF EXPERIENCE HEAD BLOWS OR OFTEN OVERLOOKED IS THE FACT THAT MOST TRAMATIC HEAD INGERY IS NOT ACTUALLY FROM SPORTS EVEN FOBATS FROM THINGS LIKE CONSTRUCTION WORK FROM HIGH IMPACT WORK OF THAT KIND SO THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME EFFICACY OF NEW PEPPED IN PARACITAM AND THINGS LIKE IT A IT'S AN EMERGING ARIA AND AS I MENTION IN THE U S THESE THINGS ARE SOLD OVER THE COUNTER AGAIND YOU ARE TO FIGURE OUT OF ITS RIPE FOR YOU BUT THEY ARE I'M BEGINNING TO SHOW SOME PROMIS AND I M AM INTRIGUED BY THEM BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY TAP INTO THE COLONERGIC SYSTEM WHICH IS BOTH DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN FOCUS AND THE ABILITY TO FOCUS BUT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THINGS RELATED TO AGE RELATED COGNIVE TO CLINE SO A DECLINE IN COLONERGIC TRANSMISSION OR A SEAT OF COLING AS WE CALL IT IN THE BRAIN IS ONE OF THE THINGS ASSOCIATE WIT COGNIVE DECLINENG IT DOES SEEM THAT INCREASING COLONERGIC TRANSMISSION CAN OFFSET SOME OF THAT COGNIVE TECLINE AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO IN CONDITIONS SUCH AS VASCULAR DAMAGE OR CONCUSSION TO THE BRAINE IF YOURE INTERESTED IN A TYPICAL TREATMENTS FOR AHT H T COMPOUNDS ARE IMPROVE FOCUS AND RELATED THEMES AND YOU LIKE READING ABOUT THE STUFF THERE'S AN EXCELLENT REVIEW ARTICLE THAT I CAN REFER YOU TO IT'S BY ON AT ALL AH N A IT WAS PUBLISH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THE TIMES ALTHOUGH ITS SURPRISINGLY COMPREHENSIVE GIVEN THAT WHICH LINES UP ALL THE VARIOUS DRUGS THAT IAVE DISCUSSED A RACITAMS AND ATARALL AND RIDDLELIN AND A VARIOUS FORMS OF DOPOMANERGIC AGENTS AND COLONERGIC AGENTS SPELLS OUT WHEATHER R NOT THEY ARE SOLD OVER THE COUNTER BY PRESCRIPTION AND REALLY LINES THEM UP IN ALL THEIR EFFECTS THEIR DRAWBACKS ET CETERA I'L REFER YOU TO THAT STUDY ITS AVAILBOL IN ITS FULL LENGTH FORM ON LINE FOR FREE AM IT'S ON AT ALL THAT THE JOURNAL IS NEUROL PLASTICITY NAUROLE PLASTICITY TWENTY SIXTEEN SHOULD BE VERY EASY TO FIND IF YOU PUT THOSE KEYWARDS IN AND WHILE IT IS AF REVIEW IT IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND YOUREALLY INTO THIS STUFF AND YOU ALSO ON TO LEARN A THING OR TWO ABOUT HOW THESE THINGS INTERACT WITH NEURL FEED BACK ET CETERA THERE SOME INFORMATION IN THERE AS WELL I KNOW I HAVE ALREADY COVERED A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT THERE IS ONE MORE CATEGORY OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY TY AND FOR ENHANCEMENT OF FOCUS IN ANY ONE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AND THAT'S TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION ALSO CALL T MS IS ACHIEVING INCREASING POPULARITY NOWDAYS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL SORTS OF NEUROLOGIC CONDITIONS IN PCSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS IT IS A NON INVASIVE TOOL IT INVOLVES TAKING A COIL IT'S A DEVICE WITH A COIL THAT'S PLACED OVER PARTICULAR LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN AND THEND SENDS MAGNETIC STIMULATION INTO THE BRAIN IT CAN ACTUALLY PASSD THROUGH THE SKULL WITHOUT HAVING A DRILL THROUGH THE SKULL AND NOWADAYS CAN BE USED TO BOTH LOWER THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY IN SPECIFIC BRAIN AREAS IT'S SPACIAL PRECISION IS NOT REMARKABLE THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT OF USE BUT IT IS NOT A SUPER FINE GREIN TOOL ONKAI IT'S NOT A CANNON BUT ITS ALSO NOT A NEEDLE IT IS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN IT CAN DIRECT THE ACTIVITY OF PARTICULAR BRAIN REGIONS AT PARTICULAR DEPTHS AND AS I MENTION IT CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE THAT ACTIVITY SO FOR INSTANCE I'VE HAD A TAMUS COIL PLACED ON MI HAD NOT FOR THEIR PEUTIC PURPOSES EVEN IT WAS I WOULDN'T TELL YOU BUT RATHER JUST FOR WELL IM A NEUROW SCIENTISTS AND I WORKED IN ALOUD WITH ONE FOR ENTERTAINMENT EXPLORATORY PURPOSES PLEASED ON TO THIS AT HOME IT WAS PLACED OVER MY MOTOR QUARTEC WHICH GENERATES VOLUNTARY ACTION AND IT WAS A COIL THAT AT THAT TIME COULD ONLY INHIBIT NURONS AND SO WHAT I WAS DOING IS I WAS MOVING OBJECTS SUROUND ON A TABLE JUST LIKE I AM NOW IT WAS ACTUALLY A PENCIL NOT A PEN AND I WAS TAPPING THE PENCIL AND THEN THE TIAMUS COIL IS TURNED ON AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME I COULD NOT MOVE THAT PENCIL OC BECAUSE IT WAS INHIBITING MY UPPER MOTOR NEURONS IN THE PORTION OF MY QUARTECS THE CONTROLS VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY AS SOON AS THE COIL WAS TURNED OFF I COULD RETURN TO TAPPING THE PENCIL AGAIN NOWADAYS IT'S POSSIBLE TO STIMULATE MOTOR QUARTEX OR ANY AREA OF THE BRAIN WITH SOME DEGREE OF PRECISION THAT COULD CREATE THE IMPULSE TO MOVE WITHOUT ACTUALLY MAKING THE DECISION TO MOVE HEE CAN LITERALLY ENGAGE CERTAIN NARAL CIRCUITS AND THEREFORE BEHAVIORS END CERTAIN THOUGHT AND EMOTIONAL PATTERNS BY WAY OF TRANSTRANUAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION THIS HAS FAR REACHING AND VAST IMPLICATIONS AS YOU CAN I PROBABLY IMAGIN IN DISCUSSING EIGHTY H T WITH A COLLEAGUE THAT USES T M S WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THEY ARE TAKING THE T M S COIL TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS THAT HAVE EGHT H T AND THEYARE USING IT TO STIMULATE THE PORTIONS OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT ENGAGE TAST DIRECTED FOCUSE STATES SO RATHER THAN USING A DRUG THAT GENERALLY INCREASES DOPOMINE AND SOME OF THE OTHER CHEMICALS INVOLVED THERE U USING DIRECTED T MA STIMULATION OF THESE CIRCUITS AND FORTUNATELY I WAS QUITE RELIEVE TO HEAR THIS THEY AR COMBINING THAT WITH A FOCUS LEARNING TASK SO THERE LITERALLY TEACHING THE BRAIN TO LEARN IN A NON INVASIVE WAY NO DRUG AT ALL AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE EXPERIMENTS CLINICAL TRIALS GOING ON COMPARING T MAS OF THIS SORT TO THE DRUG TREATMENTS OF THE SORT THAT WE DESCRIBED EARLIER THAT ENGAGE THESE CIRCUITS THROUGH PHARMICHOLOGIC MECHANISM SO VERY EXCITING TIMES FOR T MAS VERY EXCITING TIMES FOR FARMER COLOGY RELATED TO GHTY H T AND FOR ENHANCING FOCUS IN GENERAL AND WHEN I SAY VERY EXCITING TIMES I MEAN NO DRUG IS PERFECT BUT THE CONSTELLATION OF DRUGS THAT'S OUT THERE IS GETTING MUCH LARGER BUT BECAUSE THEY TAP INTO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THEIR CIRCUITRY I DO THINK THAT WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO IDENTIFYING THE IDEAL COMBINATIONS OF DRUG TREATMENTS TECHTING LOGICAL TREATMENTS AND BEHAVIORAL PARADIMES FOR INCREASING FOCUS IN BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH GHTY H T AND AS A FINAL FINAL POINT I ALSO WANT TO MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE MAKING IT HARDER FOR ALL OF US TO FOCUS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT WE HAVE PRE EXISTING EGHT H T OR NOT THE PROBABLY GESTS WHERE THIS IS GOING EVERYBODY NOWADAYS SEEMS TO HAVE A SMART PHONE I'M SURE THERE ARE FEW INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE THAT DON'T HAVE A SMART PHONE NONE THE LESS MOST PEOPLE HAVE THEM MOST KIDS WANT ONE AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET THEM AND THEY ARE SMALL THEY GRAB OUR ATTENTION ENTIRELY BUT WITHIN THAT SMALL BOX OF ATTENTION THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ATTENTIONAL WINDOWS SCROLLING BY RIGHT SO JUST BECAUSE IT'S ONE DEVICE THAT WE LOOK AT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE FOCUS WE ARE FOCUSED ON OUR PHONE BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH CONTECTS WICH IS UP SO FAST WITHIN THE PHONE IT'S THOUGHT THAT THE BRAIN IS STRUGGLING NOW TO LEAVE THAT RAPID TURN OVER OF CONTEXT RIGHT MANY MANY SHOWS MANY MANY IN SERGRAM PAGES MANY MANY TWITTER FEEDS MANY MANY WEBSIDES BASICALLY THE WHOLE WORLD AT LEAST IN VIRTUAL FORMAT IS AVAILABLE WITHIN THAT SMALL BOX UNLIKE ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGY HUMANS HAVE EVER DEALT WITH BEFORE EVEN THOUGH THEREARE TRILIONS INFINITE NUMBER OF BITS OF INFORMATION IN THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL WORLD YOUR ATTENTIONAL WINDOW THAT APERTURE OF CONSTRICTION AND DILATING THAT VISUAL WINDOW IS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU COPE WITH ALL THAT OVERWHELMING INFORMATION TYPICALLY WELL WITHIN THE PHONE YOUR VISUAL APERTURE IS SET TO A GIVEN WITH IT'S ABOUT THIS BIG TYPICALLY THE PHONE SEEM TO BE GETTING BIGGER BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S ABOUT THAT BIG AND WITHIN THERE YOUR ATTENTIONAL WINDOW IS GRABBING IN NEAR INFINITE NUMBER OF BITS OF INFORMATION COLORS MOVIES IF A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS A MOVI IS WORTH ABILIAN PICTURES THE BRAIN LOVE'S VISUAL MOTION AND SO THE QUESTION IS DOES THAT SORT OF INTERACTION ON A REGULAR BASIS LEAD TO DEFICITS IN THE TYPES OF ATTENTION THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO PERFORM WELL IN WORK IN SCHOOL RELATIONSHIPS ET CETERA AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES IT DOES APPEAR SO WE ARE INDUCING A SORT OF EIGHTY HT AND WHILE THE STUDIES ON THIS ARE ON GOING BECAUSE PROMINENT USE OF SMARTPHONES REALLY TOOK OFF RED ROUND TWENTY TEN AND WEROLIAN TWENTY TWENTY ONE LONG STANDING STUDIES TAKE TIME JUS ESSENTIALY TO SAY THE SAME THING IS LONGSTANDING THERE ARE SOME STUDIES IN ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT LIKET A HIGHLIGHT ONE WAS I SHY CARRIED OUT PRETTY EARLY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THIS IS A STUDY THAT EXPLORED SMARTPHONE USE AT THE TIME THE CALLED AT MOBIOL PHONE US BUT SMARTPHONE USE AND IN THE TENTION DIFFICULTIES IN ATTENDING IN SEVEN THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWO ADOLESCENCE IS A HUGE STUDY A POPULATION BASE CROSSECTIONAL STUDY AND YOU WILL BE PROBABLY SUPPRISED AND SOMEWHAT DISMAYED TO HEAR THAT IN ORDER TO AVOID TIS DECREASE IN ATTENTIONAL CAPACITY ADOLESCENCE NEEDED TO USE THEIR SMART PHONE FOR LESS THAN SIXTY MINUTES PER DAY IN ORDER TO STAY FOCUSED AND CENTERED ON THEIR OTHER TASKS OTHERWISE THEY STARTED TO REALLY RUN IN TO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES SO SIXTY MINUTES IS NOT MUCH I'M I'VE A FEELING THAT MOST YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USING THEIR PHONE MORE THAN SIXTY MINUTES PERDAY I KNOW I AM I THINK FOR ADULTS THE NUMBERS PROBABLY HIGHER MEANING IF YOUR AN ADULT I COULD I'M GOING TO JUSTIC STRAPOLATE FROM WHAT I READ IN THIS STUDY IT SEEMS THAT PROBABLY TWO HOURS A DAY ON THE PHONE WOULD BE THE UPPER LIMIT BEYOND WHICH YOU WOULD PROBABLY EXPERIENCE PRETTY SEVERE ATTENTIONAL DEFICITS I AM A BIG FAN OF CALNEWPORT WHO WROTE THE BOOK DEEP WORK HE'S ALSO WRITTEN THE EXCELLENT BOOK A WORLD WITHOUT EMAIL I'VE NEVER MET HIM BUT OF A HUGE ADMIRE OF HIS WORK AND I WILL A PERAPHRASE SOMETHING THAT HE SAID FAR MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I EVER COULD WHICH IS THAT THE BRAIN DOES NOT DO WELL WITH CONSTANT CONTEXT SWITCHING MEANING IT CAN DO IT BUT IT DIMINISHES OUR CAPACITY TO DO MEANINGFUL WORK OF ANY OTHER KIND AND SO CALAS I UNDERSTAND IS VERY I HE'S OUT COMPUTER SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN BY THE WAY IS VERY STRUCTURED AND VERY DISCIPLINE IN HIS AVOIDANCE OF SELPHONE USE I THINK WE'RE ALL STRIVING TO DO THAT I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO BUT I THINK WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE EIGHTY HT OR NOT IF YOU ARE AN ADOL ESSON LIMITING YOUR SMART PHONE USE TO SIXTY MINUTES PER DAY OR LESS AND IF YOU ARE AN ADULT TO TO HOURS PER DAY OR LESS IS GOING TO BE AMONG THE VERY BEST WAYS TO MAINTAIN JUST TO MAINTAIN YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AT WHATEVER LEVEL YOU CAN NOW AND AS I ALWAYS SAY MOST OF THE THINGS THAT WE GET RECOGNIZED FOREIGN LIFE SUCCESSIVE IN LIFE IN EVERY ENDEAVOR WHETHER NOT ITS SCHOOL RELATIONSHIP SPORT CREATIVE WORKS OF ANY KIND ARE ALWAYS PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF FOCUS THAT WE CAN BRING THAT ACTIVITY IT IS IMPORTANT TO REST OF COURSE TO GET PROPER SLEEP BUT I STAND BEHIND THAT STATEMENT AND I LEAVE YOU WITH THAT STUDY ABOUT ATTENTION AND SELPHONES AND HOW SELPHONES ARE INDEED EROTING OUR ATTENTIONAL CAPACITIES SO I REALIZE I COVERED A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT EIHTY HT AND THE BIOLOGY OF FOCUS AND HOW TO GET BETTER AT FOCUSING WE TALKED ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FENITYPES OF AHTY HT WE TALKED ABOUT THE UNDERLYING NERL CIRCUITRY WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE NEUROW CHEMISTRY AND WE TALKD ABOUT THE VARIOUS PRESCRIPTION DRUG TREATMENTS THAT ARE AIMED AT THAT NARROW CHEMISTRY AND AIMED AT INCREASING FOCUS IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH AIGHTY HT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUNDS THE ROLE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF DIETS AND ELIMINATION DIETS ND WE TALKED ABOUT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE VARIOUS FEATURES IN DICTATING OUTCOMES FRADY HT AND ENHANCING FOCUS IN GENERAL WE ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EMERGING NAURO TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW CERTAIN TECNOLOGIES LIKE THE SMARTPHONE ARE NO DOUT HINDERING OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND PUT US AT GREATER RISK OF DEVELOPING TY HT AT ALL AGES I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IRONY AND SOMEWHAT THE CONTRADICTION OF DOING A TWO HOUR PLOSS

SEE THESE TWO GREEN EYES AT THE VERY END OF HIS TUNNEL STARING BACK AT ME AND THE THING ABOUT THESE HIGHBRNATIN BEARS IS THEY BEARS DON'T HIHBRNATE VERY DEEPLY SO IF A BEAR HEARS YOU APPROACHING ITS

CAT'S EYES OR DEAR EYES ARE WHATEVER THAT REFLECTS LIGKHT BACK AT YOU AND UM AND THEY REFLECT A REALLY CUND OF GREEN GLOW AND SO IT'S JUST AGAIN THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES LIKE YOUR CRAWLING DOWN A DEEP

LOOKING FOR ANY CUES THAT BEAR WAS GOING TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND AT THAT POINT YOU'LL LEAVE IM WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR UH THEY MAKE A REALLY DISTINCTIVE SOUND WHEN THEY'RE REALLY A REALLY UPSET AND THEN THEY ALSO CAN THEY MAKE THIS REALLY INTERESTING JAW POPPING NOISE TO IT LETTEALLY LIKE CLACKS ITS JAWS AT POPS ITS JAWS IT'S KIND LIKE O SOUND AND THEN FROM THERE IT PROCEEDS TO SWATTING THE GROUND WITH ITS PAWS AND THEN IF IT IS STILL UPSET IT'LL BLUFF CHARGE YOU AND A BLUFF CHARGES JUST WHERE THE BEAR COMES AT YOU AND THEN STOP SHORT ARE YOU TERRIFIED OH YE OH YA'S ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED I HAVE A VIDIO THAT I TOOK WHEN I GOT CLOSE TO THE BEAR I TOOK A QUICK IDEAL FOR MY FOWN AND I AT THE VERY END OF IT YOU TO SEAR ME SAY THIS IS SO SCARY HEATH O THIS I SOS NOT I SCARE SSCARE 'S I REALLY PLESITS ITS TERRIFYING I CSH ALL OF MY BODY WAT OF MY PSYCHE WAS SAYING YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS DEN TIT'S THIS FEELING OF BEING A SOFT PINK HUMAN BEING IN A PLACE WHERE WE DON'T BELONG COURS A WEST BEING IN THE TUNNEL WITH IS BEAR HE'S A BEAR EXPERT AND HE'S THOUGHTS SOM ABOUT WHAT THIS EXPERIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR THE BEAR WHERE THESE BLACKBEARS LIVE THERE THEYRE TOP DOG THERE'S NOTHING BIGGER OR MORE DANGEROUS THAN THEM AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE STUFF THAT CRAWLS INTO THEIR DENS AND GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THEM SO IT MUST BE A VERY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FOR THEM AS WELL LIKE I'M OBVIOUSLY A BEAR LIK WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THING DOING IN HERE WIK WHEN THE BEAR SEES YOU LIKE IT KNOWS IT CAN KICK YOUR OUS RI LIKE COU CULD JUST LOOK AT YOU AND IT DOESN'T EVEN WITHOUT EVEN THINKING OF DOING ANY MATH IN ITS HEAD OR SOMETHING IT JUST SEES YOUR SIZE AND IT JUST KNOWS LIKE YOU'RE NOT A THREAT BUT THEN IS IT SCARED YET YOU KNOW I THINK THE THING THAT YOU THAT WE HAVE TO REALIZE WITH WILD ANIMALS IS THAT FOR THEM A FIGHT MEANS MUCH MORE THAN CAN I WIN OR OR WILL I LOSE IT'S LIKE I'M AM I GOING TO BE INJURED IN THIS BECAUSE FOR ANY ANIMAL ITBEARS INCLUDED IF THEYE SUSTAIN A BIG INJURY IN ANY KIND OF YOU'LL SCUFFLE OR FIGHT OR WHATEVER THAT COULD BE A DEAT SENTENCE FOR THEM BECAUSE THEN THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY OF FEED OR ESCAPE OR EVEN MOVE AND SO THEY

REGISTERING THAT HES THERE AND JUST KEEPS WALKING PAST HIM WELE SO YET SO AT THAT POINT I RAN AND UM  THE THING THAT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WAS THE DRUG TAKE HOLD WHILE THIS BAR WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY AND HAVE IT TUMBLE DOWN THE HILL SIDE OR DOWN A CLIFF SIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I JUST WASN'T WILLING TO WHAT THAT HAPPEN SO I RAN AND ACTUALLY GRABD THE BEAR BY ITS BACK LEGS AND PULLED THEM OUT FROM UNDER IT AND THEN I STRADDLED THE BEAR AND PUSHED ITS HEAD DOWN INTO THE SNOW IN THE MEANTIME IAD SLAYLY LAWAY WHAT AN Y WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT CAUSE THE BEAR IS KIND OF WEG IS THE BEAR WALKING LIKE A SORT OF CARTUN YOU KNOW DRUNK BEAR KIND OF THING LIKE ITS STAGGERING ALONG YET THAT'S HONESTLY EXACTLY HOW IT WAS WALKING THAT'S A PERFECT REPSA ION

WEST REMEMBERS IT WORE  COULD JUNIPROPUSH BUT ANY CASE THE DOEST JOB THE BEAR STOPS FINALLY PASSES OUT ON THE GROUND THEY DO THEI BUSINESS CHANGE THE COLLAR EXAMINE THE BEAR AND THEN SO BHER DOESN'T

TERROR THAT THEY FELL IN THAT TUNNEL WES SAYS IT WAS A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF FEAR HE DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED LIKE THE KIND OF PRIMAL FER A LONG AGO HUMANS MUST HAD ALL THE TIME FACING OFF WITH ANIMALS AT WANTED TO KILL THEM AN EAT THEM AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'VE FORGOTTEN BUT I THINK IT SOMETHING THAT STILL SITS DEEP INSIDE OF US THAT WHEN YOU DO HAVE THESE EXPERIENCES WITH LARGE ANIMALS THAT IT GIT BUBBLES TO THE SURFACE AND IN A WAY IT WAS REALLY IT INTOXICATING I'LL TELL YOU LIKE THAT NIGHT I DIDN'T SLEEP AR WINK BECAUSE MY DRANELON WAS JUST COURSING THROUGH MY BODY OM THEY JUST MADE ME FEEL I HONESTLY LIKE MADE ME FEEL VERY ALIVE AND AH EVEN WHEN I THINK BACK ON THAT I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE FEELINGS I HAD THAT NIGHT AS I WENT BACK TO MY THE CABIN AND EVERYTHING JUST HOW BRIGHT THE STAR SEEMED AND HOW PRIS THE AIR FELL AND IT REALLY JUST REMINDED ME HOW GOOD IT IS TO BE ALIVE IN THE BEAR THE BEAR IS FINE THE DUGSAGATER PROBABLY DOESN'T REMEMBER THE DETAILS OF WHAT HAPPENED WEST

IS A SOUVENIR HE SAYS IT STILL SMELLS PENGLY LIKE BEAR AF N THE BRAY WE HAV ANOTHER STORY OF PEOPLE THROWN INTO AY DANGEROUS AND UTTERLY FOR SEEABLE SITUATION AND HOW THEY HANDLE IT IN THIS EPISODE THET WE CALING THE BEAR AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WASN'T JEFF BY THE AY OF A POD CASTS WERE THEY TELL STORIES OF ANIMAL ATTACKS IS CALLED TOOTH AND CAW IF I YOU ENJOYED THE STRING THAT YOU SERD YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY THEIR STANDARDS THIS STORY WAS NOT SO SPECIAL THE ONES WEN THEIR SHOW WAY OR EVENTFUL MORINAMEN UT MCCAGOBOBEGRADIO WHON A PROGRAM CONTINUES TIS MAR CON LIK FROM OUR GLASS TO TACES PROGRAM AGAIN THE BEAR AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL STORIES PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES TRAPPED IN SOME DANGEROUS SITUATION AND NOW THEY JUST HAVE TO DEAL WE HAVE ARRIVED TAT AT TWO OF OUR SHEL ACT TWO THE DEVILS IN THE DETAILS AND THERE ARE SO MANY DETAILS SO FEW MONTH AGO WE BRUGHT YOU THE STORY FROM ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS MEEKING MEK ABOUT AN OB G WYAN IN RURAL ITAO IT WAS DECIDING WHETHEROR NOT TO LEAVE THE STATE AFTER ROVERSIS WAGE WAS OVERTURNED AND ABORTION WAS OUTLAW THERE I DONT ONT TO LEAE HERE AN LE I THON'T WONT TO LEAVE YIT I DON'T IF I CAN SAY THE SOB G WYANN AMELIA HUNTSBURGER WAS FACING A NITOHO A SET OF BORTHON LAWS THAT KICKED IN AFTER ROW WAS OVERTURNED THAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE IN THE COUNTRY AND CON JUS TAY I THINK WHEN MOST OF US THINK OF THESE LAWS WE THINK OF THEIR EFFECT ON ABORTIAN CLINECS AND ABORTION CARPROFIDERS THAT WAS IN THIS STORY A MELIA WAS A GENERAL OB G WYAN AT HOSPITAL AND OTHER WAS DOING PAPSMERS BIRK CONTROLLED GIVING BABIES AND OUR HOSPITAL DID NOT TERMINATE PREGNANCIES UNLESS IT WAS A MEDICAL COMPLICATION WHICH BY THE WAY IS LIKE MOST HOSPITALS IN T E ITEDSTATES BUT WHEN ROS OVERTURNED AND THESE NEW LAWS AND I THO TOOK EFFECT THEY DEFINED ABORTION IN THE BROADEST POSSIBLE TERMS IT WAS EFFECTUALLY A COMPLETE BAN EVEN PREGNANCIES THAT WEREN'T COUN BE VIABLE COULD NOT BE TERMINATED AND ANY DOCTOR WHO PERFORMED AN ABORTION BREAKING THOSE RULES FACE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES THEY GOOAS AR MEDICAL LICENSE THAT GO TO PRISON FOR TWO TO FIVE YEARS AND THEY COULD GET SUED FI LE MEMBERS COULD SU IF A RAPER IS ORDERED IN A PREGNANCY AND THE VICNIM DECIDED TO GET IN ABORTION THE RAPEST'S FAMILY COULD SUE THE DOCTOR FOR PERFORMING THE ABORTION N THE PROBE FOR AMELIA THE SO B G WYAN SI YRAN IN TO ALL KINDS OF SITUATIONS WHEARE IN THE COURSE OF AD MINISTERING NORMAL HEALTH CARE FOR HER PATIENCE SHE COULD RUN A FOUL THE LAW FOR INSTANCE IFO PATIENT SHOWED UP AT HER HOSPITAL MISS CARRING AND BLEEDING ON CONTROLLABLY NTHE PAST AMELIA COULD TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY TO STOP THE BLEEDIT BUT NOW SHE  BE CHARGE WITH A FELONY IF SHE DID THAT IF SHE DID ANYTHING DETERMIN INTO PREGNANCY IF IT STILL HAD A QUOTE FEEDLE HEARTBEAT THAT'S FRASE IN THE LAW THOUGHIN THE EARLY STAGES IT'S NOT A HEART BEAT IT JUST ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN SOME TISSUE THAT COULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A HEART SO NOW WHEN AMELIA FACED PREGNANCIES WAS SERIOUS COMPLICATIENTS SITUATIONS WERE THE LONGER SHE WAITED TO ACT THE MORE DANGER THE PATIENT WAS IN SHE COALD NO LONGER JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS BEST FOR THE PATIENT WHO WAS IN FRONT OF HER EN WHEN YOU DO SURGERY LIKE THAT WHERE SOMEBODY'S HAVING ONGOING OCTIVE BLEADING THAT'S ALLREADY HIGH STRESS AND DOTS OR HIGH STRESS LIKE A TRAINED FOR THAT I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THT I CAN HANDLE THAT THEN YOU ADT IN THIS OTHER WEARD LAYER O LIKE IS HER BROTHER CAN AN NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS A NOT VIOABLE PREGNANCY IN THAT HER LIFE WAS AT RISK AND LIKE WHAT ABOUT HER MOM WHAT ABOUT HER PARTNER WHAT ABOUT HER SISTER THEY AR DO THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS THIS CONDITION IS OR DO THEY ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT I REMOVED THE PREGNANCY THAT HAD A HEART BE I DON'T KNOW HOW MASS TOS TO KNOW SO SHE WHERE Y BECGOTING SUED SHE WERE TO BET GETTING PROSECUTED THIS CAME UP ALL THAT NAND THE END OF HER STORY BACK IN MARCH AMEIA WAS STILL HANGING ON IDOM STIL DESIDED SINCE THAN SO MUCH AS HAPPENED JUST A FEW

LIHKT AND I GET A DI AS MIG BEBE AT A DI LI BEER NO GUARANTEESS FOR ANYONE PREGNANT PERSON DOCTOR ANY ONE WHO MIGHT WANT A LOOK AT THE MATERNAL MORTALITY STATISTICS AND IDHO SINCE THE NEW LASS PAST THE STATE USE TO HAVE A COMMITTE THAT TROCED MATERNAL DEATHS IN THEIR COUSES BUT IT DOESN'T ANY MORE THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED NOT TO RENEW IT IN ITS LAST SASSION IDAHO IS NOW THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT A COMMITEE LIKE THIS SO THAT'S THE SITUATION FOR THESE WOMEN WHO JUST NEEDTED GENERAL OB J WAYAN CARE DURING THEIR PREGNANCIES BUT THEN THERE ARE THE HIGH RISK PATIONS WHICH INCLUDES BY THE WAY ANY OE WHO'S EXPECTING TWINE ANY ONE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSUR OR DIABETIES ANYONE OVER THIRTY FIVE AND ANY ONE WHOSE PREGNANCIES INCLUDE RARE COMPLICATIONS THESE PEOPLE ARE IN A MUCH MORE DIRE SITUATION IN ITAHO NOW TBECAUSE THEY MAY NEED WHATS CALLED A MATERNAL FEEDAL MEDIC N DOCTOR THESE HER HIGHLY SKILLED U BE JUYANNES SPECIALISTS AT KEEPING BOTH THE FEDUS AND THE PATIENT ALIVE AND HEALTHY THROUGH THESE PREGNANCIES AND THESE DOCTOR HAD BEEN LEAVING THE STYE CAYLIS SMITH HAD A MATERNAL FEEDAL MEDICINE DOCTOR HER FIRST PREGNANTCY HAD COMPLICATIONS BUT THINGS WERE GOING SMOOTHLY WITH THIS ONE IT WAS A BOY SHE AD HER HUSBAND HAD PICKED OUT A NAME BROOKS AND THEN WHEN SHE WAS NINETEEN WEEKS SHE WENT IN FOR HER ANATOMY SCAN AND I I JUSEREMEMBER THIS HONOGRAPHLI I KNOW THEY CAN'T SAY ANY THING BUT SHE JUS LIKE KEPT GOING OVER HIS HEART LIKE QUITE A BEH AND SO OF COURSE I'M LIKE TALKING MYSELF DOWN LIKE IT'S SINE LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST DIFFERENT THIS TIME LIKE EACH PERSON HAS A DIFFERENT WF DOING THINGS UM AND THEN IT WAS JUST REALLY QUIET AND THEN SHE LEFT AND SO EM DOCTOR COOPER HER WALKED INTO THE ROOM DOCTOR KIHLY COOPER HER MATERNAL FEEDAL MEDICINE SPECIALIST I JUST REMEMBER SHE HAD A DIOGRAAM AN AM SHE I JUS REMEMBER HER BEING LIKE I'VE NEMBER STEM  HER DEFECTE THIS SEVER BEFORE I LIKE THEY COULDN'T REALLY SEE THE BABIES I OR ER AT ALL LIKE HIS I GUES SAY WERE TO ARCH WAS IT REALLY FORMED THE ONLY THING CALA WANTED TO KNOW WAS COULD BROOK SURVIVE PASS BIRTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD ALREADY DECIDED THAT COULD CARE FOR A CHILD WOITD SPECIAL NEEDS SO DOCTOR COOPER REFERRED HER TO A PEDIATRIC PRARDIOLOGIST BUT HE TOLD HER NO BROOKS'S CHANCES OF SURVIVAL WERE VERY UNLIKELY HE CALLED SOME OF THE BEST PEDIATRIC HOSPITALS IN THE COUNTRY AND NONE OF THEM COULD OFFER HER A SURGICAL OPTION TO FIX IS HEART SHE REMEMBER SITTING IN AN ULTROSOUND ROOM WITH HER DOCTOR SHE'S LIKE IF YOU DISIDE TO CONTINUE THIS PREGNANCY LIKE I YERE FOR YOU AND WE WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO FOR ME SHE'S LIKE BUT IF YOU DO DISIDE THAT YOU DID NOT WANT TO COTNS PEGNANT SHE SHES LIKE JUST REALLY SORRY TI TI I PERSONALLY CAN O ANYOU UNDERSTOOD AT THAT POINT LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE LAWS YE YEH I MEAN HER HANDS WERE TIED I KNEW I KNEW SHE WAS PROTECTING HERSELF BUT ALSO LIKE I WOULD NEVER ASK HER TO BE IN THAT POSITION YEH WE JUST ALL CANT IVE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER LIKE WIT THEHO WE DO NOW MOST PATIENTS LIKE CAYLA WHOSE PREGNANCIES HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED LEETHAL AND LIFE LIMITN'T FEEDAL ANOMALIES SHOOSE TERMINATION BECAUSE CONTINUING THEIR PREGNANCIES WILL RESULT IN MISCARRIAGE STILL BIRTH HER DEATH SHORTLY AFTER DELIVERY BUT CALIS DOCTOR COULD NOT OFFER HER ATERMINATION JUST A WEEK OR SO BEFORE THIS TERMINATING THE PREGNANCY LIKE BROOKS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AN I LEGAL ABORTION AN ITAHO BUT NOW UNDER IDA HOSE NEW LAWS IT WAS SO CALISTARTED ASKING HER DOCTOR ABOUT WHAT IF SHE DID CONTINUER PREGNANCY AND DELIVERED BROOKS WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE FOR HIM WOULD HE FILL ANY PAIN DURING THE BIRTH WOULD HE SUFFER FROM AIR HUNGER FEEL BREATHLESSNESS AS HE GASPED FOR AIR BUT OF COURSE HER DOCTOR COULDN'T GUARANTE THAT HE WOULDN'T FEEL ANYTHING EVEN WITH PALIATIVE CARE AND MORPHINE SO THAT IT JUST ALSO FELT LIKE THERE IS ONLY ONE OPTION AND IT WASNIT ONE THAT WE WANTEE AKE BUT BIKE I DON'T WANT MY SUNDITSUFFAR I DON'T I'M NOCKING UPOT MYSELF THROUGH THAT AND I'LL GO LIKE RISK MY OWN LIFE BEC DOCTOR COOPER CEPORATOR BATING SHOE SHE'S LIKE YOU HAVE AFORE TO PRESENT EM TO GETTING PREGNAMCY AGAIN PREACLANCIA IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF MATERNAL MORTALITY ET USUALLY INVOLVES THE SURGEON BLOOD PRESSUR THAT CAN SERIOUSLY HARM OR KILL A PREGNANT PATION IT'S UN PREDICTABLE AND HARD TO KNOW WHEN IT'LL HAPPEN AND HOW SEVERE IT WILL BE WHICH BRINGS US TO THE MAN THING DOCTORS FIND SO FROSTRATING ABOUT IDA HOSE NEW ABORTION LAWS THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE LAW THAT SAYS THEY CAN'T TERMINATE A PREGNANC Y UNLESS IT'S QUOTE TO PREVENT THE DEATH OF THE PREGNANT WOMAN DOCTOR COOPER SAID SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT MEAN SHE'D HAVE TO WAIT FOR CALA TO BE NEAR DEATH'S DOOR FROM PREACLAMPCIA BEFORE SHE COULD INTERVENE HER WHOLE TRAINING ALL DOCTOR'S TRAINING IS THE STOP PROBLEMS BEFORE DEATH AFER BECOMES EMMINENT THE ONLY OTHER SITUATION WHERE DOCTOR COOPER COULD TERMINATE A PREGNANCY IS IF THE FEETAL

IT IS S STREAMS OF BLOOD GOING INTO THE DRAIN IN THE WHOLE TIME WEARE JUST LIKE WISE THIS AMPANI THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING IF BACCA HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET A TERMINATION AND IDAHO IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE HER DACTOR KINDLY COOPER COULDHAVE DONE THE PROCEDURE AS SOON AS SHE DECIDED ECCA WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT IN A DAY NOT IN A HOTEL ROOM FAR FROM HOME IN THE MORNING WHEN THE CLINIC OPENED UP A COUPLE TEM POLEESE SHOWED UP TO COLLECT THE FEEDUS BACA THEN HOBBLED OVER TO THE CLINIC FOR AN EXAM IT WAS NEXT TO HER HOTEL AND SHE HAD TO WALK PAST THE LINE OF ANTI ABORTION PROTESTORS HER HAUSBAND HAD TO STAY BEHIND TO WATCH THEIR DAUGHTER WHEN SHE CAME BACK THEY DROVE HOME TO IDAHO SEVEN HOURS THEY SAT SILENTLY ALMOST THE WHOLE WAY BEFORE TALKING TO CALAN BACCA ONE PART OF THE POSTROW EXPERIENCE I'D NEVER HEARD ABOUT WHEZAT PEOPLE WHO HAD TO TRAVEL OUT OF STATE TO TERMINATE SAFELY HAD ALL THESE COMPLICATIONS FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE REMAINS TBECAUSE OF RULES ABOUT TRAVELING ACROSS STATE LINES WITH HUMAN REMAINS BACA HAD WANTED TO DONATE THE BODY FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH TO GIVE HER PREGNANTCY LOST MORE MEANING BUT FOR LEGIOUS SICAL REASONS OF THE CLINIC SHE DIDN'T GET THAT OPTION BACCON HER HUSBAND DECIDED TO CREAMING BUT THEY HAD NO IDEA WHEN THE CLINIC WOULD SEND THE REMAINS A COUPLE WEEKS LATER WERE HOME AND AA POSTA WORKER COMES UP TO OUR DOOR AND WAS I CAM HERE WOU NEED ACIDE FOR A PACKET AND OSLIK O E THERE'S THIS WHITE BOX THAT SAYS REMAINS WABLED ON EVERY SINGLE SIDE OF THE BOX FOR SOME REASON THE BOX WAS A DREST TO BABY AND NOT THE PARENTS AND THE POSTOR WORKER DOESN'T ACTUALLY REALIZE IT UNTILL I AS SINING FOR IT SHE SAW THE NAME ON THE TOP IN HER FACE JUST SO THIS IS LIKE O COOD BI AND LEATHELYJUS WE N O SUC AS GROB THE BOX AND SHUT THE DOOR OF THE SET AS A TERRIBLE CODA TO A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE BACCHOME BACCAWORRIED THAT PEOPLE WHO'D HELP THEM GO OUT OF STATE MIGHT GETTIN TROUBLE IF SHE TALKET ABOUT IT IT WASN'T CLEAR WHO APPROSECUTOR MY GOAFTER SO IN THE EARLIEST HARDESDAYS SHE HAD A SECRET INSTEAD OF JUST A LOS  I DODN'T SEE LI COUN GET OPENLY TALK ABOUT IT AND IS A LOT OF THE GRAVEN PROXESS I WAST FOR ME AS BEING ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT ABOUT IT LIK GOT YOU KNOW MEVEN JUST AS SYMPATHIZE OR EMPATHIZED WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO GOT THROUGH SOMEWHAT S TOTUATION EE IT PEOPLE BE JUSTO IT MADE IT AND MUTED AND QUIET VERY LONELY GREEVING PROCESS BACCA AND CALAM AT RECENTLY THE PART OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH OTHER PATIENCE AND DOCTORS WHER TRYING TO SOOTH A STATE HOPING TO EXPAND THE EXCEPTIONS IN THE ABORTION LAWS TOINCLUDE LEETFUL FEEDAL ANOMALIES LIKE THE ONES THEY HAD IN THEIR PREGNANCIES AND MOST IMPORTANT THEY WANT THE LAW TOLL LOUD DOCTORS TO PROVIDE ABORTIONS TO PRESERVE A PERSON'S HEALTH NOT JUST TO PREVENT THEIR DEATH WHICH IS THE LANGUAGE IN THE LAWRIGHT NOW THEIR CASE WAS FILED BY THE CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RITS WHO FBILED SIMILAR LEGAL ACTIONS AND OTHER STATES WITH RESTRICTIVE LAWS THEY RE PRESENTED THE ABORTION CLINIC IN THE SUPREME COURT CASE THAT OVERTURNED ROW ACONCAC TO THE TWO IDAWHO LAWMAKERS IN THE HOUSE IN SENATE WHOS SPONSOR THE LAW THAT CRIMANALIZES ABORTION I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW THEY THINK ITS WORKING WERE THEY HEARING ABOUT THE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES I WAS DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE DOCTORS LEAVING THE STATE DID THEY THINK THEY NEED TO MAKE ANY CHANGES ONE OF THE LAW SPONSORS DECLINED AN INTERVIEW AND THE OTHER DIDN'T RESPOND TUMULTUUL REQUESS SO I REACHED OUT TO REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WHO VOTED FOR THE LAW BACK IN TWENTY TWENTYE BEFORE REAFHAL ATE SENATOR JIM GOT THREE REPRESENTS THE DISTRICT AND SOUTHERN ITAHO AND IDENTIFIES AS PRO LIFE I WAS SURPRISE HE WALKED INTO THE INTERVIEW WITH A NOTE BOOK WOULD STATS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS WHO LOFT THE SATE AND STARTED SITING THEM TSO FAR IT'S AT LEAST NINETEEN DOCTORS BECAUSE THAT WORRIED HIM A'M PRO LIFE BUT I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME CONSIDERATION FOR THE DO IS THEY PRACTISE IF THEY'RE NOT IN FIND IM SELSION AN IN CORT THE SECOND IS A HELP OF THEM AW HAS HEN YOU TALK ABOUT PRO LIFE THE LIFE OF A MOTHER IS IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THAT THAT'S PRO LIFE TO TO ME WHEN YOU FIRST VOTED FOR THE ABORTIONLAWS DID YOU THINK THAT ROE WOULD ACTUALLY FALL OR DID IT FEEL MORE LIKE A SYMBOLIC ACT AT THAT TIME IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I I THINK TO ANSWERE THAT HONESTLY A PROBABLY DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN YOU KNOW BEBECAUS TAT WHAT I DONE ON FOR WHAT FIFTY YEARS SOMETHING LIKE THAT HE'S THE CHAIR OF A COMMITTEE IN TA SENN THAT ABORTION BILLS GO THROUGH BEFORE THEY GO TO THE REST OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THOWHE SAYS THE LANGUAGE IN THE ABORTION MAN WAS ALWAYS MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN HIS OWN PERSONAL BELIEFS AT THAT TIME WHEN YOU VOTED FOR THEM WERE YOU LOOKING THAT CLOSELY AT THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAWS YOU KNOW MAY MAYBE THERE WAS SOME THINGS OVERLOOKED AS FAR AS WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE IS WOULD BE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T TRULY CONSEQUENCES YET AND YOURE SHUT CONSCIOUS YOU'RE THINKING IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AL RETURN SILL THIS IS ONE WAY YOU CAN MAKE A STATEMENT YOU KIND O GET INTO THAT DEAL WHERE IF YOU'RE PRO LIFE EVEN THOU THE BILL HAS SOME THINGS HER PROBLEMATIC YOU KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO COME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF OF ARRYING ON THE SIDE OF PROTECTING THE UNBORN LIKE THE OTHER LAW MAKERS I TALK TO HE SAYS HE BELIEVE THE INTEN OF THE LAWS WHEN HE VOTED FOR THEM WAS A SHUT DOWN ABORTIONS HAPPENING IN CLINICS IN THE STATE NOT TO HELP SHUT DOWN A RURAL LABOR AND DELIVERY UNIT ARE FORCE PATIENCE TO TRAVEL OUT OF STATE BECAUSE OF SEVERE FEEL ABNORMALITIES THOSE WERE CONSEQUENCES HE DIDN'T FORSATE NOW SEEING HOW THINGS OF PLAYED OUT DO YOU REGRET VOTING FOR THOSE LAWS OR WOULDYOUHAVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME IN THE CONTECT OF BEING PRO LIFE AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNBORN I FEEL LIKE THAT BOT AT THAT TIME WITH WHAT WAS IN PLACE AS FAR AS TRYING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST AN EMBED AT LAW I I THINK THAT WAS IN PROPRIATE BOT AT THE TIME EVEN NOT ONCE TO ROVER  WAY ESHALL RETURNED AS WHEN THE WEALITY I THINK SHUNKIN FOR ALL OF US I TALKD TO THREE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS AND THEY WERE ALL IN THE SAME SITUATION TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HAD JUST BEEN THEORETICAL POLICY WHEN THEY FIRST LOTED FOR THEM BUT NOW WAS REAL LAW A FACTING REAL SITUATIONS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES WE REPUBLICAN LAW MAKERS USED TO BE PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME SIDE NOW THEY HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOT UP LIE PRO LIFE TO ITAHOSE NEW LAWS THE NEXT LAW MAKER I TALKE TO WAS REPRESENTATIVE BRENT CRANE FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS HE'S REPRESENTED A DISTRICT OUTSIDE OF BAISY AND MAKES HIS LIVING RUNNING A FIRE ALARM AND SECURITY BUSINESS HE BELIEVES IN LIFE TAT CONCEPTION AND SAYS HE'S PROUDLY SPONSORDOR COSTPONSOR MORE THAN A DOZEN PIECES OF ANTI ABORTION LEGISLATION HE IN SENATOR GOT THREE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE AS FAR AS SEEING THE NEED TO BROADEN EXCEPTIONS IN THE ABORTION LAWS BUT THEY ALSO HOP TO WORK ALONGSIDE LAW MAKERS WHO THINK THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY EXCEPTIONS FOR INSTANCE FOR RAPIN INCESSVICTOMS ROBER RESENATOF CRANE DESCRIBES HIM IS STILL STUCK IN WHAT HE CALLS A PRE R O MINE SIDE FOR EVERYTHING IS STILL BLACK AND WITE ME HE SAYS HE USED TO VE ABORTION THAT WE TOO UNTILL ROW FINALLY FALL A I REMEMBER SIT BY THE FIREPLACE MY WIFE THAS SHUSUALLY WHERE WE SIT DOWN  IN THE EVENING OR EARLY MORNING AND I SAID AM I'VE GOT A GET MY HEAD AROUND THIS ISSUN BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THIS IS ESTATE  DID YOU O SA A POST ROE INFIRONMENT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN IN A PRE RO ALL LEGISLATURES CRAFTED DESTRIES IT QUESTIONS UP BEFORE THE COURT WELL NOW YOU'RE IN A POSTUR ENVIRONMENT WERE YEU HAVE TO GOVERN THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE LEGISLATION THAT THAT IS GOING TO WORK AND FOR A PRO LIFE LAWMAKER MOST PRO LIFE LAW MAKERS WILL TAKE A VERY CONSERVATIVE AND VERY RIGID STANCE ON THE ISSUE OF LIFE LIKE AM NO I'M NOT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY GROUND AT ALL FOR ANY MORE EXEMPTIONS THAT'S IT WHATEVER FOR ME PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES WHERE THE FAMILIES NEED TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AGAIN THIS IS HA PLACE WERE LAWMAKERS WHO USED TO ALL BE ON THE SAME SIDE OF A PORSION ARE NOW IN CONFLICT AND THERE WAS E DRAFT OF THE BILL IN THE LAST LEGISLATIVE SASSION THAT GOT TO THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT LAW THE WAY OL BE DUE BI ANCIA THE BILL WOULD HAVE A LOWED ABORTIONS FOR SOME SERIOUS HEALTH COMPLICATIONS BEFORE THEY BECAME LIFE RI ME IN OTHER WORDS LETTING DOCTORS MADE DECISIONS BASED ON THE HEALTH OF THE PREGNANT PERSON NOT JUST THEIR POTENTIAL DEATH REPRESENTATIVE CRANE CHAIRS THE HOUSE COMMITTEE THAT ABORTION LEGISLATION GOES THROUGH AND HE SCEDLE THE HEARING FOR THE BILL THAT HE'D A CANCEL OF THE LAST MENET BEAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE VOTES TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE FOR SOME OF HIS MEMBERS CONSIDERING THE HEALTH OF THE PREGNANT PERSON OPEN TO CANOPWORMS BEHIND CLOSE DOOR I WAS PARTHER TOBE AND THEN IF FOR OPENING HEALTH OF THE MOTHER WHERE TOS THAT STOP IS AT MENTAL HEALTH IS IT JUST TIHD TO PHYSICAL HEALTH IS A FINANCIAL HEALTH WHAT WHAT IS HALE HOW YOU DEFINING HEALTH THE MOTHER REPRESENTATIVE JULIAN YOUNG IS REPUBLICAN FROM SOULTH EASTERNI TOHE SHE'S VICE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE AND OPPOSE THAT NEW LANGUAGE ABOUT HEALTH COMPLICATIONS WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS PUT LANGUAGE IN THAT SO VAGUE THAT IT HAS THE EFFECT OF OPEN THE DOOR TO ABORTION IN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU COULD PROTECT BOTH LIVES AND SO FOR TALKING ABOUT HIG BLOOD PRESSURE IF WOR TALKING ABOUT CONDITIONS THAT ARE COMMON TO PREGNANCY THAN WE DON'T WANT THAT LUMPED INTO ANYTHING THAT COULD BE A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION FOR THE MOTHER BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT AS WOMEN WE PUT OUR LIVES ON THE LINE BY CHOOSING TO HAVE CHILDREN THERE ARE ALWAYS RISKS WITH EVERY PREGNANCY AND YOU CAN NEVER ELIMINATE EVERY RISK WHAT IS YOUR YE AT WHICH HER MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE OF PREGNANCY ELL WELL I'M NOT ING A CLAIM TO BE AN OBE DUIEN THAT I'VE LEARNED LOT WOR THE YEARS AND A YOU KNOW IT I GUESS I SPEAK TO THE ISSUE NOT AS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL BUT AS A MOTHER THAT'S REALLY WERMI EX PRETISIS SHE HAS TEN CHILDREN SHES SWITCHES OFF BRINGING HER YOUNGEST TO TO THE CAPITAL WITH HER AND THE SIT ON ON COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND HEARINGS ALSO RANDOF FACT TURNS OUT MY UNCLE WAS HER ORTHODONTIST WHEN SHE WAS AKEAD REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG IS WEARY OF LETTING DOCTORS CONSIDER THE HEALTH OF THE PREGNANT PERSON OF GIVING DOCTORS AND I THO HOSPITALS THE KIND OF CONTROL THEY HAD BEFORE ROFELL FOR REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG THE SWEEP OF THE NEW LAWS IS NOT SOM OVERREACH IT IS THE POINT THE CONCERN I THINK WITH THE HEALTH EXCEPTION IS THAT WE HAVE SOME IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WHO PRACTISED IN AN ENVIRONMENT FOR A LOT OF YEARS WHERE THE LIFE OF THE CHILD WAS NOT VALUED EQUALLY IR ABOUT IN IT A  HOSPITAL SPECIFICALLY THAK AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT WAS THE WAY IT WAS HAT IT WAS A FETUS THAT WAS A CLUMP OF SELLS AND THERE WASN'T THE PROTECTION IN THE COURTS FOR THE L IFE OF THE CHILDS UNLIKE SENTATOR GOT THREE WHO IS WORRIED ABOUT DOCTORS LEAVING IT HOM REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG THINKS THAT SOME ITO HO O B G IANS ARE EXAGGERATING THEIR FEARS ABOUT PROSECUTION UNDER THE LAW SHE SAYS OTHERS AR SCARING THEMSELVES I OVERTHINKING THE PHRASE TO PREVENT DATH SHE POINTS TO LANGUAGE IN THE LAW THAT SAYS THEY CAN USE THEIR QUOTE GOOD FAITH ME DICAL JUDGMENT REPRESENTATIVE CRANE WHO TALKED ABOUT THE PRE RO AND POST RO MIND THATS OF REPUBLICANS ALSO AGREES WITH HER ON THUS ON THIS TOPIC HE DOESN'T SEE IS MUCH CRAY IF YOU'RE NOT PERFORMING ELECTIVE ABORTIONS YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT JUST LIKE IF YOU'RE NOT GOING OVER THE SPEEDLEMIT YOU DONT HAVE TOE WORRY ABOUT A COP POLLING YOU OVER FOR SPEEDY ELECTIVE ABORTIONS IS A PHRASE ANTE ABORTION LAW MAKERS AND ACTIVE ASUSE BUT IT'S NOT A MEDICAL DISTINCTION IN MEDICINE ANY TERMINATION OF A PREAGNANCY FOR ANY REASON IS AN ABORTION WHETHER IT'S TO PREVENT DATH OR TO HELP RAP AN INCESVICTUMS ORE JUST NOT WANTING TO BE PRAGMENT THEY'RE ALL JUST CALLD ABORTIONS JUST CONNECTS LIKE THIS IN TERMINOLOGY ARE ANOTHER FROSTRATION DOCTORS AND ITO  HAVE ABOUT THE NEW LAWS O B G ANS WHO HAVE LEFET AN ONCE THAT ARE TRYING TO FIGERE UP THEY CAN STAY BUT ARE'T SURE IF THEY CAN SAY IS ARE LIKE THE LAW IS STILL VAGUE TO ME I WHA'S THO THEY WHAT'S THE TAS THE BIGNESS FOR THEM THERE'S AN EXCEPTION THA FOR LIFE OF THE PRAGNAT PATIENT BUT WHAT DOES THAT NEED TO BE WHT DIS THAT DEFINED IS THAT FIFTEEN PERSENT CLOSE TODATH FIFTY PER CENT FORTYFIVE AND ALSO THERE ARE THESE THINGS THAT COME UP WE KNOW THIS PERSON HAS PROCLANCY IT IS GOOT IT DEVOLP I CAN'T SAY HEN  LIKE A JUST I CAN'T OPERATE AN THAT AREA BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THAT HEALTH LANGUAGE I SO D JO ME HONESTLY DO YOU SHINKS IT IF A DOCTOR DI SAYS HE LOOK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE YOUR CHILD THAT GOES TO DOWT I'M GOING TO EITHER HAFT IF I DON'T TAKE THE CHILD THE MOBS GOAN TO DIE WHAT HYEU WANTIG TO DO TAKE THE CHILD HE DOES THAT AND YOU GET A A WILDLY AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTOR THIS SAYS I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO COURT FOR VIOLATING THE TRIGGERLAW ON THE SATE OF OUT YOU THINK A REASONABLE COURT OF PEOPLE THA ARE MADE UP OF JUST HONEST CITIZENS LIKE YOU AND I ARGANTISAY YVERGN T THROWING A JAIL FOR THAT RI PROSECUTU FOR THAT THET THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HOW LONG SI THE LAWPEN AN EFFECT RIGHT BEEN IN EFFECT Y OVER YOUR HAVE ANY DOCTORS BEEN PROSECUTED HAVE ANY CASES COME FORWARD O I THINK  DOT DOCTORS ARE SAYING IS  LIKE I KNOW LAWMAKERS ARE TELLING US THAT BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PROSECUTOR ISN'T GET TO COME AFTER ME THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A FAMILY MEMBER ISN'T ET ASSUE ME AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO TO COURT AND I HAVE ALSO GOT KIDS ANDI'VE GOT A LIVELIHOOD YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN AGY THAT'S REALLY AGGRESSIVE SO THAT LIKE THE LAWMAKERS ASSURANCE OF NO ONES GET TO COME AFTER YOU YHOY'RE NOTK AT A LOSE AN COURT ISN'T ASSURANCE FOR ME I UNDERSTAND I MEAN TT I I SPENT MORE THAN ALMOST NINETY DAYS LISTENING TO THESE EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS AND SO I ME LOOK LIFE OF THE MOTHER IS LIFE OF THE MOTHER IT'S YIT'S NOT THIS HIGHLY TECHNICAL HIGHLY NEW WANTS ARGUMENT THAT I THINK THAT SOME OF THESE FOLKS ARE SCARED ABOUT I DON'T KNOW I ME YOUR REPORTER I'M I'M A ALARM GUY I  FOR ME'S PERTY SIMPLE LIFE OF THE MOTHERHAY THE MOTHER'S LIFE CAEN THEN I KNOW I I HAVE THE ABUILITY TO OPERATE IN THI SPACE IMI THINK THAT'S WHER OB GU AN'S GET TAT WE HAVE LEGISLATORS WHO ARE NOT DOCTORS THAT'S TRUE AH BUT BUT ON THE FLIPSIDE YOU HAVE DOCTORS THAT ARE TRYING TO TELL LEGISLATORS HOW TO DO THEIR JOP AND A WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS THAT AR ASKING US A THIS JUST WHAT WE WANT YOU DON'T ACT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE TENTION EXISTS I RAN BY HIM AND REPRESENTATIVE YONGS SOME OF THE SPECIFIC EXPERIENCES I'D HEARD FROM PRIGMANT WOMEN IN OB G IANS THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO BEEN STOCK SHOLDDERING THE EMOTIONAL AND LEGISTICAL BURDENS OF THE NEW ABORTION LAWS AND HOW DISCONNECTED THEY SAID THEY THOUHT FROM THIS NEW ERA AND ITO HOM THAT SUPPOSE TO BE PRO LIFE AND PRO FAMILY HERE'S HOW REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG SEES THIS MOMENT SO WHAT I HEAR YOU DESCRIBING A LOT SEEMS LIKE ADJUSTING TO A NESITO ATION AND UNDOUBTEDLY THERE'S A LITTLE PAIN WITH EVERY CHANGE AN SO THERE'S WE JUST DON'T LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT PERFECTLY ALL THE TIME AND SO THAT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S SOME IN CONVENIENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING THE POLICY CHANGE TO PROTECT LIFE DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS TWO SIDES TO THE STORY AND THERE A LOT OF BABIES WHO WERE GOING TO LIVE IN THIS STATE THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE LIVED AND THAT'S VALUABLE THAT'S WORTH PROTECTING THAT'S WORTH PAYING A PRICE FOR EVEN IF IT MEANS THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME GROWING PAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OB J WHAT ENDS IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN TELLING ME THAT ACCESS TO GOOD MATERNAL HEALTH CURE AND IDEHO HAS SUTERATED SO RAPIDLY OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT THE STATE IS NOW IN CRISIS IS THAT FUL ACCURATE TO YOU AS CRISIS THE WORD THAT YOU WOULD YOUS YET YOU KNOW I GUESS I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET BUT WHAT WHAT I KEEP COMING BACK TO AS A LEGISLATOER IF YOU ARE A PHYSICIAN THAT DOESN'T WANT TO ADHERE TO AT A STANDARD OF PROTECTING BOTH THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER AND THE LIFE OF THE CHILD THEN THAT MAY BE FRESTRATING FOR YOU I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SORTING OUT MAYBE AS THI STANDARD OF PRACTISE A JESTS TO WHAT THE STATUTE IS UCONCERN IS IS LIKE YOU KNOW PEOPLE AN ADJUSTMET IS YET YE'L LOKN TEM SAYING MEKE IS I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE TO DESERT THIS THIS VALUE OF PROTECTING LIFE IN ORDER TO HAVE A THRIVING OB COMMUNITY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THESE TWO THINGS WORK TOGETHER AND IT MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION AND FIGUREET OUT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE IN THE YEAR AFTER I DA HOSE NEW LAWS WEN TO A FACT REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG AND OTHER LAW MAKERS DID END OF MAKING A FEW CHANGES TO THE LAW SOME OF THE MOST NOTABLE ABORTIONS ARE NOW LEGAL FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF PREGNANCIES THAT ARE NEVER GOING TO BE VIABLE LIKE ECTOPIC PREGNACIES AND ABORTIONS ARE NOW LEGAL FOR RAPAN INCESVECTUMS IFS THOSE VICTIMS DO IT IN THE FIRST THIRTEEN WEEKS AND FIOLEPLECE REPORT SINCE MOST SEXUAL SSALT VICTIMS NEVER REPORT THIS IS STILL A STEEP BARRIER BUT THE THING O B J ENNE'S WANTED MOST NEW WORDING THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONSIDER THE HEALTH OF THEIR PREGNANT PATIENCS LEJUSTLATERS DIDN'T GIVE THEM THAT THE LAW MAKER SAY THERE STILL WORKING ON IT BUT AFTER THAT LEGISLATIVE SESSION ENDED THAT'S WHEN MOST OF THE O B J YENNES WHO LEFT THE STATE ORE DECIDED TO RETIRE ERLYG GOT OUT WE'RE LIVING IN THIS MOMENT OR THERE'S A POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL SORTING HAPPENING IN MANY PARTS THE COUNTRY THERE PEOPLE WHO ARE PICKING OUP AND SPECIFICALLY LIVING TO RED OR BLUE STATES TO SCAPE THE LAWS THEIR STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE PASSED IT JUST SEEMS EASIER THAN TRYING TO CHANGE THE POLITICS OF THE PLACE WHERE YOU LIVE BUT THE BIG QUESTION FOR THE PATIENTS I TALK TO AN ITO HO IS HOW MANY O B J  ENNES WILL STILL BE LEFT STANDING TO CARE FOR THEM AFTER THE SORTING OUT PERIOD REPRESENTOF YONG BROUGHT UP IT'S FINALLY DONE IN A RECENT SURVEY FIFTEE PER SENT OF OB J YENNES IN THE STATE SAID THEY WERE DEFINITELY LEAVING ORE STILL CONSIDERING LEAVING FIFTY PER SENS MAKING MEN SONE THE PRODUCIONS TO AR SHOW TO THE WOMEN IN HER STORY WITH HIGHEST PREGNANCIES THET CANT CALA OR PREGNAN A GAIN BOTH WITH GIRLS TEY WILL

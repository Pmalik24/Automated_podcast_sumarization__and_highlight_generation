FROM W EASY CHICAGO IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIFE I'M SHOHN COAL SITTING IN FOR IR GLASS BACK WHEN ARAN WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE HAD THIS FREND JOSH THEY KNOWN EACH OTHER PRACTICALLY SINCE THEY WERE BORN THEIR PARENTS WERE FRIENDS THIS WAS IN A SMALL SMALL CITY AN WISCONSEN FUN WAS GOING DOWN TO THIS PARK WITH BUFFALO IN IT AND THROWING THEM HUNKS OF BREAD ANYWAY ARON WAS FIFTEEN JOSH WAS A YEAR OLDER AND ONE PARTICULAR DAY HE GAVE ME A MIX TAPE OUT LIKE A MIXED SEDY ROM JUST TO SAY THIS WAS LONG ENOUGH AGO THAT THE WORD ROM NATURALLY FOLLOWED THE WORD SE D OR TALKING MAY BE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND A I CAN SEE I CAN SEE THE SEEDY RA YOU CAN SEE IT IN YOUR MINDS AE YOU MEAN YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT IT I NO  CERTAINLY NOW I CAN SEE LIKE SHARP BEE SCRIBBLED ALL OVER IT AND IN SORT OF SCRAWLED HANDWRITING IN SQUIGGLES IS IS WHAT I WHAT I CAN RECALL JOSH WAS INTO THEATR HE AND ARAND DID PLACE TOGETHER ACTUALLY MUSICALS AT THIS LITTLE COMMUNITY THEATERE IN TOWN HE WAS LIKE IF THERE WAS A JOCH OF FEEDER KIDS LIKE THAT WOULD BE HIN SO CARRISMATIC YOU KNOW LIKE THE STAR OF EVERY PLAY I REALLY LIKE GRABBING EVERYTHING HE COULD OUT OF LIFE AN YOU COUL TAY WIT A LITTLE BIT DRAMATIC SHEL REMEMBERS A COUPLE OF THE SONGS THET WERE ON A MIX TOR SHE DOES REMEMBER THE EXACT NUMBER OF SONGS FOR REASONS THAT WILL BECOME CARIN AMINIGH THERE WERE TWELVE OF TE TWELVE SONGS I AN DUTIFULLY UPLEDED IT INTO MY ITUNES AND LISTEN TO IT AND THIDN THINK MUCH OF IT I DON'T KNOW E DID READ IN TO IT AS I SHOULD HAVE I MEAN LITERALLY LITERALLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT MIND YOU THIS NEXT PART WAS MONTHS AFTER HE GAVE HER THE S D SOLIDLY MONTHS AH I WAS I DON'T KNOW PUGGING RAN AND ITUN'S LIVARY REORGANIZING SOMETHING AND I LOOKING AT IT AND IT DAWNS ON ME THAT THE SONG TITLES SPELL OUT LIKE AN ACROSSTICK I LOVE YOU ERAN I AT A SECOND YET DOWN DOWN THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE OF THE TRACKLESS THING IN I TUNS  THE THE FIRST LETTER OF EVERY SONG AS YOU READ DOWNWARD SPELLED OUT I LOVE YOU ARAN YEI DID ARON AND MISSET IT AT FIRST BECAUSE LOADING IT INTO ITUNES SOMEHOW THE TRACKLISTING HAD BEEN REVERSED SO INSTEAD OF SPELLING OUT I LOVE YOU ERAN IT SAID MERA OI EVIL EYE NOT QUITE AS ROMANTIC   HO SUNC THE STILL REMEMBERS ONE WAS YELLOW BY COLD CLAY WAS THE WHY YOU THE E AT THE END OF LOVE ER MAYBE THE BE GINNING OF ERAN WAS ELEPHANT LOVE MEDLEY FROM THE MOVY MOULON RUGE WHICH ITSELF WORKS A LITTLE LIKE A MIXTATE THESE TWO CHARACTERS CHRISTIAN AND SETINE JUST CURL LINES FROM FAMOUS LOVE SONGS BACK AND FORTH AT EACH OTHER I CONSTS  S N  SARINGOTTLE CRENCHY ABOUT THAT ONE AND YOU MIGHT THINK ELEPHANT LOVE MEDLEY ALONE WOULD BE A DEAD GIVE AWAY BUT TO HER THAT WAS JUST JOSH BEING JOSH LIKE SHE SAID DRAMATIC A THING ABOUT MIXED TAPES THERE LIKE THE MOGIS OF YESTER YEAR YOU COULDN'T ALWAYS BE SURE WHAT THE INTENDED MEANING WAS OR IF THE RECIPIENT WOULD COMPREHEND SAID MEANING LIKE DOES HE LOVE ME OR DOES HE JUST LOVE THESE SONGS SO IN THAT WAY JOSH LITERALLY SPELLING IT OUT LEAVING NOTHING TO THE IMAGINATION WAS A DECENT STRATEGY EXCEPT EVEN THAT WAS LOST ON ERAND DUE TO SOM DUM HICK UP IN THE MACHINE IT WAS YOU KDON' IT WAS A LAT IT WAS A LOT OF EMOTIIT WHICH I FELT TERRIBLE FOR MISSING EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT GET A RECIPROCATE AT LEAST YOU FEE LIKE YOU SHOULD BE GETTING THE GESTURE RI BUT I I JUST HADN'T SEEN IT HE WAS STRICTLY A FRIEND YOU WAS A FRIEND WE HAD LIKE KIND OF A THING A KIND OF A THING YET NURSERING I CRASH WE NEVER DIDIT BUT LOOK FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME MAY I ASK AN INDELICATE QUESTION AN YOU MAY DID YOU EVER KISS HER ANYTHING A  IKELY PROUDLY MADE OI TURNED OUT TO BE GAY SO WHE THEM MI HAVE A FEA RAAN REVELATIONS FOR THEERS TO COME JUST WASN'T THE TIME OR GENDER WHO DO RIGHT YO KNEW YET IMPORTANTLY ARRON HAS NO MEMORY OF EVER TELLING JO SHE SAW HIS SECRET MESSAGE SO HE WAS JUST LEFT IN THE DARK WONDERING I STAYED FRIENDS MOVED ON SO IACH OTHER A FEW MORE TIMES AFTER HIGH SCHOOL BUT EVENTUALLY LOST TOUCE  HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN YEARS AT THIS POINT IT'S FUNNY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT DEEPLY FELT WAS COMMUNICATED AND RECEIVED AND YET REMAINED UNSPOKEN I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF HER LIKE HER MINY GRANGER SHE WAS LIKE MY HER MIGNY GRANGER THIS OF COURSE IS JOSH I DIDN'T BRING UP THE MIXED TAPE RIGHT AWAY WHEN I TALKED TO HIM FIRST I JUST ASKED HIM WHAT HE REMEMBERED ABOUT ARRAN SHE WAS JUST SO SMART AND WELL RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY AND COULD JUST TALK CIRCLES AROUND ANYBODY AND I'M YET HER INTELLIGENCE WAS VERY INTIMIDATING TO ME INTIMIDATING REALLY BUT IN YOU KNOW IN A FRIENDLY WAY SHE WOULD NEVER SHOW OFF ABOUT IT I I HAD A CRUSH ON HER TO BE HONEST ANY TIME I WOULD HAPPEN TO DRIVE BY HER PLACE I WOULD I WOULD THINK LIKE THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY YOU KNOW I WAS ALWAYS LIKE THE FEELING BUT I'M YET WE WERE FRIENDS JOSH UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T HAVE A COPY OF THE MEX TAPE ANY MORE EITHER DIDN'T REMEMBER ANY OF THE SONGS THAT WERE ON IT BUT HE DID REMEMBER SPELLING OUT HIS DEVOTION WITH THE TITLES HEWAS BASHFUL ABOUT IT AS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE WHEN TALKING ABOUT STUFF THEY DID AS A TEA NAGER I GUESS I WAS READING LIKE IM DAN BROWN AND ALL THESE KIND OF SPY THINGS AND JUST LIKE THROWING HIDDEN MESSAGES AND TO THINGS AND YI WAS  I GUESS I WAS TRYIN TO DO IT IN MY OWN WAY AND YOU COULD PRACTICALLY HEAR HIM BLUSHING WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD PUT ELEPHANT LOVE MEDLY ON THERE YET THAT'S GUSS I THOUGHT I WAS CHRISTIAN FROM E LONRUGE YE I JUST LOVED THE KIND OF LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS HE PUT ON ROMANTIC LOVE I ALWAYS HAD A THING ABOUT THAT AND CLEARLY MUCH MUCH TO MY DETRIMENT AT TIMES HONESTLY AND YOU KNOW HERE'S A MILLIAN WAYS WE COULD PSYCHOMANALIS THAT BUT YE DID I DID I TELL HER THAT IT SPELLED THAT I NO U NO IHOPE SHE FOUND IT O OL CAS SO HERE'S FOR HERIM BROUGHT THE SEETY I TOOK JOSH THROUGH EVERYTHING ARRAND TOLDME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS HE WAS ONLY JUST NOW LEARNING WHAT HAPPENED WITH HIS LITTLE LETEVENSHE LOVE COAT THAT SHE HAD SEEN IT THE MESSAGE GOT THROUGH SHE JUST HADN'T FELT THE SAME WELL O CA WELL I GUESS I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR TO GO ANY BETTER THAN THAT WAT HOW HOW IS THAT IT GOING WELL WELL BECAUS LIKE HIDS AN A HAPPY ACCIDENT YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF COOL THAT IT HAPPENED IN ITS OWN TIME I DON'T KNOW I PICTURE A LOVE A LOVELORN JO SITTING SITTING ING HIS BEDROOM LIKE WETING  UNDERING LIKE WHEN IS SHE GONE A YE I ONLY THEN THAT'S TRUE AS I SAID I WAS KIND OF INTIMIDATED BY HER YOU KNOW AND I THINK PARTICULARLY AT THAT TIME FOR ERRAND TO BE THE PERSON THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD DAT WAS LIKE BEYOND SOMETHING THAT SEEMED REALISTIC I WAS YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE TOTALLY A I SE I WANTED HER TO KNOW SOMEHOW ON SOME LEVEL BUT I ALSO DIDN'T ONA PUSH THE MATTER OR MAKE HER YOU KNOW FEEL UN COMFORTABLE OR UM I DON'T KNOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE'D PROBABLY TURNED ME DOWN I GUESS I JUST WONDER I MEAN OTHER THAN IT BEING A SORT OF VERY OPACAN AND ONE COULD ARGUE IN EFFECTIVE WAY OF OF CONVEYING ONE'S LOVE TO PUT IT IN A CRUSTIC ON A MIXED TAVE I DON'T THINK IT WAS INEFFECTIVE AH I CHALLENGE THAT I THINK IT'S LIKE UM IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT IF IT GOT THROUGH AND TERMS OF A REALLY REALLY CLEAR COMMUNICATIONITS LIKE IF IT WAS THERE EVEN IF IT WAS OUT OF ORDER YOU KNOW WHEN SHE FIRST POPPED IT IN IT WAS SOMEHOW THERE I THINK IN MY MIND LIKE ENERGETICALLY YOU KNOW AND I STILL SEE THE TRANSMISSION EVEN IF IT WAS CAN QUIET YOU KNOW IN WONT SENT TOU GRAND BUT I THINK THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE POWER OF MIXED TAPES WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER A CERTAIN WAY THE POWER OF MUSIC EVEN OR AT LEAST THE POWER THAT WE BELIEVE IT HAVE THAT IT CAN CONFESS DEVOTION ON OUR BEHALF EVEN IN THE FORM OF AN EXPLODED PUZZLE OVEN THE MOST CASUAL MIXTAPE THAT YOU MAKE PLAYLESS THESE DIT THAT YOU MAKE FOR FRIEND YOU'RE SANG THIS IS WHAT I LIKE OR LOVETIMES THIS IS WHAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW IN A WAY YOUR SANG THIS IS WHO I AM SONGS GATHERED TOGETHER LIKE THAT OR KIND OF PARLENTS A LANGUAGE THE WORDS ARE SOME ONE ELSE'S BUT THEY'RE ALSO OUR OWN SO THAT'S WHAT'S COMING UP ON TO DAYS UP A SOD KIND OF A MIXTAPE OF ITS OWN BECAUSE WE HAVE A CRUSH ON YOU AND BECAUSE THE PARTICULAR SONGS IN THE SHOW TELL YOU WA SURPRISING AMOUNT ABOUT THE PEOPLE LISTENING TO THEM CAN WE TO PLA  FOR YOU STAY WITH US TRACK ONE JUST BE GOOD TO ME SO YOU USE MUTIC TO CONNECT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WERE SEND A MESSAGE ALLA MIXD TAPE BUT THE'RE ALL OF THESE OTHER TIMES OF COURSE WHEN YOU SORT OF COMMUNICATE WITH YOURSELF THROUGH MUSIC PUTTING ON A SONG TO REVELIN SOME FEELING OR FEELING LIKE THIS ER THAT BAND OR SINGER IS SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO YOU THIS NEXT COLLECTION OF SONGS WORKS LIKE THAT THEY'RE ALL OF A PEECE IN A WAY THAT WRITER NECOL PERKINS REALLY RELATED TO HERE'S NICHOLL THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SONGS ABOUT CHEATING SPOUSES AND THEIR LOVERS WHEN WOMEN SING THEM THEY TEND TO BE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE DISAPPOINTED AND HURT WIFE IN DOLLEY PARTON'S UNFORGETTABLE JOLENE SHE BEGS A WOMAN NOT TO TAKE HER MAN IN SHIRLEY BROWN'S BLUSY CONFRONTATIONAL WOMAN TO WOMAN SHIRLEY LETS THE OTHER WOMAN KNOW SHE'S NOT LETTING HER RUIN HER HAPPY HOME BUT HOW HAPPY CAN YOUR HOME BE IF YOU HAVE TO CALL ANOTHER WOMAN AND TELL HER IT'S HAPPY SONGS LIKE THESE METE THE OTHER WOMAN A VILLAIN WITH A CAPITAL VE THOSE SONGS WEREN'T FOR ME I WAS MORE INTERESTED AND AUNTY SONGS THE SONGS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE OTHER WOMAN THEY WERE WHAT WOMAN IN THE WRONG CORNER OF LOVE TRIANGLE SANG ABOUT FINDING GOOD LOVE IN THE MIDDLE OF BAD DECISIONS THEY WERE OLD SCHOOL SOUL AND ARMBY HITS THAT OUR MOTHERS AUNTIS AND OLDER PLAY COUSINS USED TO LISTEN TO WITH SHINING EYES AND FAR AWAY EXPRESSIONS HOLDING SWETTING GLASSES OF DRINKS THAT WERE OFF LIMITS TO US KIDS WE WERE TOO YOUNG TO BE SINGING THOSE SONGS BUT WE FELT THEIR POWER ANYWAY WE HEARD THE LONGING IN THE SINGERS FOCAL ACROBATICS AND IT MOVED US EVEN IF WE WEREN'T SURE WHY WE'D HEAR THEM ON THE RADIO PLAYED DURING EVERY QUIET STORM SOMETIMES WITH DEDICATIONS LIKE FROM DENISE TO THAT SPECIAL SOME ONE SHE SAYS YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND THEN THE ULTIMATE SIE CHIC AND THEM AS WE LAY BY SHIRLEY MERDAC WULL BEGIN TO PLAY US SONG ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE MOMENTS BEFOR YOUR MAN HAS TO GO HOME TO HIS WIFE IN WETHE TENAUNTY SONGS ARE WHERE WE GOT TO HEAR FROM THE OTHER WOMAN AND REALIZE MAYBE SHE'S ACTUALLY A HUMAN BEING WITH EMOTIONS TOO WERE HEARING THE PERSPECTIVES OF WOMEN WHO KNOW THEIR LOVE IS FUTILE BUT THEY'LL TAKE WHAT THEY CAN GET FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET IT  LONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS AUNTY SONGS ISNAT UNDER COVER ONE THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OTHER WOMAN IN SAVING ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU WITNEY HUSTON CALLS OUT HER LOVER'S LIES EVEN AS SHE CON TINUES TO WAIT FOR HIM YOU USED TO TELL ME WE'D RUN AWAY TOGETHER LOVE GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO BE FREE YOU SAID BE PATIENT JUST WAIT A LITTLE LONGER BUT THAT'S JUST AN OLD FANTASY WHEN WITNEY HITS THAT BEAUTIFUL EXTENDED HIGH NOTE ON FANTASY IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE ALL FALLING BACK INTO AN OCEAN OF HER LOVERS LIES WITH HER AND LIKE HER WE LET OURSELVES BE CARRIED AWAY ANYWAY H WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS I MET A MAN WITH A VOICE MADE FOR MIGHT HE WAS A LOVELY NURTY SAYING WITH A SHAVED HEAD AND FRECKLES A SPRINKLE OF JOY ACROSS HIS NOSE AND CHEEKS AND A FEW DOTS ON HIS LIPS THAT WERE CLEARLY TARGETS FOR MY AFFECTION HE WASN'T YET THIRTY BUT HE ALREADY HAD THE LOOK OF A HIPPOP PROFESSOR IN LINE AT WHOLE FOODS I'LL CALL HIM BAYARD AT DINNER WITH HIM AND A FRIEND I LAUGHED TOO OFTEN AND TOO HARD AT SOMETHING BAYARD SAID HE SLID ME A QUESTIONING GLANCE AFTER ONE GIGGLE TOO MANY AND I TRIED TO PULL MYSELF TOGETHER BUT IT WAS TOO LATE AT A CLUB LATER WE ENDED UP SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER TRYING TO TALK OVER THE MUSIC AT MIDNIGHT WE SAT IN MY CAR TALKING AND THEN THE SUN REMINDED US OUR DEODERANCE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS I DECIDED TO SHOOT MY SHOT IS THERE ANY ONE BACK HOME WAITING FOR YOUR MORNING CALL I ASKED HIM HE TOOK A LONG TIME TO ANSWER WHICH WAS ANSWER ENOUGH YEH THERE IS HE FINALLY SAID HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS HANDS AND I LOOKED AT THEM TOO OF COURSE HE WAS INVOLVED WITH SOME ONE HE WAS SMART CUTE AND FUNNY AND I'D MET HIM AT THE WRONG TIME WE EXCHANGED EMELA DRESSES BECAUSE THAT FELT SAFE THERE WAS NOTHING WONG WITH HAVING A PENPOLE WAS THERE SOON WE WERE EXCHANGING PAGES OF TEXT ALMOST DAILY HE'D CALL ME AT WORK AND HAVE ME CRYING FROM LAUGHTER AND SOMETIMES HE'D CALL ME AT NIGHT WHEN THAT SOME ONE BACK HOME WAS OUT WITH HER GIRLS AND HE TALK TO ME WITH THAT VOICE SAYING WHATH HIS WORDS WOULDN'T AFTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS OF CONSTANT COMMUNICATION HE CAME BACK TO NEW ORLEANS FOR ANOTHER VISIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE TOLD THAT SOME ONE BACK HOME BUT HE TOLD ME HE LOVED ME I SAID IT BACK TO HIM WE KISSED MY MEMBERY TELLS ME I HAD CANDLESLIT AND THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE I DO LOVE CANDLES I REMEMBER HIS FACE AS HE LOOKED AT ME AND TOLD ME I WAS BEAUTIFUL I BELIEVED HIM HE WAS ENGAGE TO BE MARRIED AND FOR THE MOST PART I DIDN'T CARE I DEFINITELY HAD SOME WOMAN TO WOMAN GUILT SINCE I'D HAD MY OWN HEART BREAKING EXPERIENCES WITH CHEATING EXES BUT BAYARD AND I STARTET SEEING EACH OTHER WHEN I WAS FIRMLY IN WHAT WE'D NOW CALL MY HOT GIRL SUMMER FASE I ALSO KNEW I WASN'T THE FIRST WOMAN HE CHEATED ON HER WIS I DECIDED I COULDN'T CARE MORE ABOUT HIS WOMAN THAN HE DID I REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS DECISIONS BUT I HAD NO PROBLEM BENEFITTING FROM THEM THOSE AUNTY SONGS I HAD SWAYED ALONG WITH BECAUSE I APPRECIATED I TALENTED VOICE AND GOOD MUSIC A PEALED DIFFERENTLY TO ME DURING THIS TIME NOW THEY WERE PEPTOCS IN SECRET LOVERS BY ATLANTIC STAR A PAIR OF LOVERS ARE BOTH DEVOTED TO OTHER PEOPLE YET UNABLE TO STOP THEIR ATTRACTION I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ONE I WAS COMMITTED TO UT THERE WAS A PARTICULAR VERSE I KEPT GOING BACK TO WHILE I FANCIED MYSELF IN LOVE WITH BAYARD SITTING AT HOME I DO NOTHING ALL DAN BUT THINK ABOUT YOU AND HOPE THAT YOU'REO CAM HOPING YOU CALL BEFORE ANY ONE GETS HOME I WAIT ANXIOUS LEA ALONE BY THE PHONE THIS IS THE STUFF OF SCHOOLGARL CRUSHES OF CLUMSY RAM CALM HEROINES OF SWOONING DAMSELS EVERYWHERE AND THAT'S HOW I FELT ABOUT BAYARD I JUST SO HAPPENED HE WAS COMMITTED TO SOME ONE ELSE A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT CANDELAT VISIT I WAS UNEXPECTEDLY HOSPITAL IVE AND BYARD WAS THERE FOR ME HE CALLED MY MOTHER CLEANED UP MY APARTMENT AND MADE SURE MY CAT HAD A FRESH LITTER BOX HE STAYED WITH ME THE ENTIRE WEEK EVENT AFTER MY FAMILY ARRIVE THE CARE HE SHOWED ME WAS A FANTASY I'D NEVER ALLOWED MYSELF TO INDULGE HE WAS MARRIED A FEW MONTHS LATER HE E MELLED ME FROM THE HONEYMOON AND SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THAT WE MADE PLANS TO SPEND A WEAKENED AT A HOTEL TOGETHER HE LEFT THE HOTEL WEPSIDE UP ON HIS LAPTOP AND HIS WIFE FOUND A BOOK I'D INSCRIBED WITH SOMETHING SNEAKIN SHE EVENTUALLY REACHED OUT TO ME VIA EMAL AND AIM INSTANT MESSAGING OF OLD THE EXACT MESSAGES HAVE BEEN LOST TO TIME AND ANGER BUT THE JIST REMAINS WHAT DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT ME HE DIDN'T TALK MUCH ABOUT YOU WHY YOU YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM WHY DID YOU DO IT I WANTED TO DO YOU LOVE HIM I THINK SO YES DO YOU WANT HIM NO I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE HIM FROM ME I SAW YOUR PICTURES OKE HIM DOES HE LOVE YOU ASK HIM WHY DID HE DO IT ASK HIM I PING PONGED BETWEEN A STRANGE LOYALTY TO HIM THE NEED TO DEFEND MYSELF THE DESIRED TO PROTECT HER AND THE NEED TO BE CADDY I WANTED TO TELL HER TO LEAVE THAT HE CHEATED BEFORE THAT IF IT HADN'T BEEN ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME ONE ELSE BAYARD'S WIFE REMINDED ME OF THE PETTY GIRLS IN SCHOOL WHO COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY GUIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ME I DIDN'T HAVE THE THINGS I WAS SUPPOSED TO IN ORDER TO BE ATTRACTIVE I GOT IN A FEW STINGERS BUT I LET HAR HAVE HER SHOTS WHUT EVER SHE NEEDED TO FELL BETTER AND GIVING MYSELF WHAT I WANTED I'D HEART ANOTHER WOMAN I FELT GUILTY EVEN AS I WOULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO FILL ASHAMED WHEN I WANTED TO BRUSH AWAY ANY CONCERNS ABOUT HOU HE WAS TREATING HIS WIFE OR WHEN I'D START TO FELL BAD ABOUT NOT HAVING A MAN OF MY OWN I'D PUT ON THE ESOES BANDS JUST BE GOOD TO ME TO GASP MYSELF UP AND KEEP ME FOCUSSED ON MYSELF I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR OTHER GIRLS JUST BE GOOD TO ME HIS WIFE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW I COULD BE WITH HIM AND CLAIM TO LOVE HIM BUT NOT ONT TO TAKE HIM FROM HER I WAS NO FOOL I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THE ADDED HOW YOU GOT HIM IS HOW YOU GET GOT I THINK EYE STOPP LOVING HIM FIRST HE WAS THE ONLY MAN I WAS SAYING I LOVE YOU TO IN A ROMANTIC SENSE BUT HE COULDN'T SAY THE SAME SO I STOPPED ANSWERING HIS EMALS AND CALLS HE WROTE ME A LETTER AND I BURNED IT UNOPENED AFTER I MADE THE DECISION TO LET MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BAYARD GO I FOUND MYSELF HOLDING A SWEATING GLASS AND STARING AT A BLANK WALL THE AUNTI SONGS ONCE GAVE ME STRENGTH AND NOW THEY GAVE ME PERMISSION TO CRY I MISSED SOME ONE WHO WAS NEVER MINE EVEN THOUGH I HAD MADE A GOOD DECISION IN MOVING ON FROM THE AFFAIR A DECISION THAT HAD BEEN MINE IN MOST AUNTI SONGS WE HEAR THE OTHER WOMAN PASSIVELY WAITING FOR THE MAN TO MAKE TIME FOR HER BUT IN EVERYTHING I MISSE AT HOME THE SINGER CHERALL TELLS THE STORY OF A WOMAN WHO INITIATES HER INFIDELITY AND LETS US KNOW SHE IS THE ONE DISSATISFIED IN HER MAIN RELATIONSHIP SHE CHEATS WITHOUT REGRETS AND IS GRATEFUL TO HAVE FOUND SOME ON WHO GIVES HER EVERYTHING SHE'S NOT GETTING AT HOME SHE WAS NOT THE OBJECT OF DESIRE SHE WAS IN CONTROL OF IT THE SONG IS A GRUELY SLOW JAM MADE FOR A TWO STEP AND I CONTACT PERFECT FOR A WOMAN WHO REFUSES TO FEEL REMORSEFUL ABOUT RECEIVING LOVE FROM UNEXPECTED PLACES R I LET THESE SONGS GUIDE ME THROUGH AN AFFAIR BUT THEY DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I MOVED ON I STARTED READING ROMANCE NOVELS WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG AND BECAME A DICTED TO THE PROMISE OF HAPPILY EVER AFTER FOR EVER WAS FOUND IN FICTION AND FEIRY TALES BUT IN AUNTI SONGS FOR EVER WAS A STOLEN NINE DOES THE OTHER WOMAN GET HER HAPPY ENDING MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH TO STAY IN A LOOP OF BORROWED TIME I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURE THAT OUT YET BUT I KNOW I CAN BELOVED ANYWAY I WANT NECOLBERGANS IS A WRITER FROM NATURAL TENNESSY FOR MEMOIR FROM WHICH THIS IS AY IS ADAPTED IS CALLED SOMETIMES I TRIP ON HOW HAPPY WE COULD BE AN IT'S OUT NOW COMING UP THEY SAY A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING BUT IT CAN ALSO MAKE YOU A BELOVED ROCCRITIC AT LEAST IN ONE CASE THAT'S IN A MINUTE FROM CHICAGO PUBLIC RIDIO WHEN A PROGRAMME CONTINUES IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIFE I'M SHON COL SINCE I WAS WAY THIS WEEK WE MAD YOU

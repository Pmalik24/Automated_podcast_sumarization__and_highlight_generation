TIME MILES AS A HIS STORIAN AT HARVARD AND SHE STO BLE DON'T TO A TOUR LIKE THIS COND OF ONA WHIM I WAS VISITING TE SAVANNA IT HAPPENED TO HAVE BEAND A RAINY SAID OF DAYS THAT I WALKED BY A HOME CALLED THE SIRAL WEED HOUSE AS I WALKED BY I WAS CALLED AND BECKONED IN BI A WOMAN WHO WAS STANDED OUTSIDE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME TOCATOUR THE STORE IS PRESENTED TO TYA AS A HISTORICAL TOUR NOT A GOST TOUR TI LOVES GOING ON HISTORY TOURS I HAD NEVER HEARD O THIS HOUSE BEFORE AND I WAS PERIENCE SO I WENT IN I TOOK THE TOUR AND THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT MOLLY MOLLY IS THE PERSON AT THE CENTER OF WHICH PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR GO STORY DOWN IN SUVEN HER STORY IS THE SPOO HE CLIMAX OF NERLY AR RE TOURS THE TOURGUIDES ALL STOPPED IN FRONT OF A BIG ORANGE MANSION WITH PALM TREES AND SPANISH MOSS AND HE WAY THEY TELL ME THIS BLACK WOMAN MOLLY WHOLIVED IN DUIE IN THE HOUSE WAS OWN BY WEALTHY INFLUENTIAL BUSINESS MAN MADE FRANCIS SURROUND AND HIS WIFE MATILDA MOLLY'S CAUGHT UP IN A MOVE TRING FRANCIS IS HAVING AND A FAIR WITH HER THAT'S THE WORD ANS ONLY MATILDA HIS WIFE HAS NO IDEA THEN ONE NIGHT MATILDA WALKS IN ON FRANTIS AN MOLLY AND CATCHES THEM IN THE ACT THE TILDA SO DISTRAUGHT TO LEARN THAT HER HUSBAND IS CHEATING THAT SHE WALKS OUT ON THE BALCONY AND JUMPS TO ON DECT SOME EVEN BELIEVE SHE WAS PUSHED A FEW WEEKS LATER MOLLY IS FOUND BED HANGING FROM THE RAFTERS IN THE SLAVE COURS FRANCIS IS A SUSPECT IN BOTH TENTHS TOUR IS ALL OVER THE CITY EXPLOIT THIS TRAGEDY BY CLAIMING MOLLY STILL HAUNTS THE HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS MURDER AND REMEMBER BECAUSE THESE AR GOST STORIES THAT ET TOLD WHEN A WHOLE BUNCH OF EMBELLISHMENTH AND THE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VERSIONS ON DIFFERENT TOURS I WILL SAY THAT WHAT'S INTERESTING AS MATILDA OM SHE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY CLOSE TO MOLLY MOLLY WAS CONE LIKE AN ON OFFICIAL FARAFIST FOR HERLY CONFIDANT IN SOME TORS MOLLY MATILDA COME OFF AS IF THEY WERE LESBIE AN LOVERS  HERE'S A LETTER MOLLY SUPPOSEDLY WROTE MOLBA LOVED SISTER WUL TILDA HOW I YEARNED FOR THE THE SLIGHTEST WITH OF YOURWISOFEN AND ONE GUIDE WHEN IS FARS TO END A DETAIL ABOUT MATILDA HOLDING A HOT BOLL OF SUIT WHEN SHE WALKED IN ON MOLLY AND FRANCES TOS AE STARER  O   O  AND THERE IS FRANCE WAN MOLL GET MITL   A  R ARA  A R O I A  A Y A  R   A MA O   THERE WAS ONLY ONE TOUR GUIDE WHO TALKED ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY NOT COINCIDENTALLY THE ONLY NON WHITE TORGUIDE WE HAD LETINA GUIDE MAMED SARA BECAUSE OF THE POWER STRACKSHARE THAT THIS WAS SOME ONE WHO WAS OLLEN BY FRANCIS THIS WAS NOT CONSENTIAL FOR BOUT PEOPLE THIS WAS DEFINARAT THAT'S HOW TYA SAW IT TOO EVERYONE US AS THIS SORT AFFAIR TO MY MIND THE WAY I INTERPRETED WAS SHE HAD BEEN EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABUS AND SHE HAD EXPERIENCE TRLE PAIN AND SUFFERING AFTER THAT FIRST DAYTIME TOUR WER TIA LEARNED ABOUT MOLLY SHE CAME BACK FOR A NIGHT TIME TOUR WHICH TAKES YOU TO THE ROOM WHERE MOLLY DIED AND SO THE TOURGUDE DESCRIBED I CANS AS I TELL YOU THIS I FEEL MY TOMIC TIGHTENING THE TOURGUIDE DESCRIBED THAT SHE HAD BEEN FOUND HANGING  FRAM THE RAFTERIS OF THE THE SLAVE QUARTERS AT THIS PARTICULAR ROOM AND HE TOOK US TO THIS ROOM AND HE INVITED US TO GO INSY TYA STANDS FROZEN THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR WHILE THE OTHER TORIST PUSH BIRE THEY JUS WENT ON IN AS IF THIS WAS ONLY NOJUST ANY KIND OFS STORY BUT THERE WAS KNO WAY I WAS GOING INSIDE THESE WERE WHITE GES WERE WHITE LOTHER FOOR PETISPENTS FOR WHIFE FOLKS EVERYBODY WAS BUT ME AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE HAVING THE SAME SENSE OF THE GRAVITY OF WHAD IF WHERE WE WERE WERE IN THE SLAVE QUARTERS OF WHAT OCCURD THEY JUS WHEN IT THEY DIDN'T HAVE LIKE A SORT OF REVERENCE FOR THE SPACE  ANYTHING LIKE THAT NO ONE SENG TO BLINK AN IYE AND THE TOURI GIDE WAS SO OM CAREIS MADIC HE WAS I WAS JO GEN AND HE WAS CERTAINLY MAKING LIGHT OF THE STORY AND HE WAS NARRATING IT AS IF IT WERE SOME KIND OF  HORROR SHOW THAT PEOPLE HAD ENTERED INTO FORFUN NO TO GET A HOLLOWING SCARE BY B CHOICE T THIS POINT THE TORGOD TAKES OUT OF PHONE AND PLACED THIS AUDIOCLIP THAT HE SAYS WAS FEATURED ON THE TEVY SHOW GHOST ONNERS THEY FILLED AN EPISODE IN THE SURRAL WHEET HOUSE BUT TIA HEARD WAS A WOMAN'S VOICE SCREAMING HELP O GOD HELP AND THE MUFFLED SOUND OF HER CRYING HARD OF ME WAS SHOCKED AN APALLD AT WHAT I WAS HERRIN AND THAT SAME HARME THAT WAS SHOS IN APALLED FELTS  JUST A RUSH OF A SENSE OF PROTECTIVENESS FOR MOLLY FOR THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO REALLY WAS A TEA NATURE WHO IS JUST EXPLOITED  BE USED EUSED AND THEN BLAMED AND THEN KILLS BUT ANOTHER PART OF ME AND THIS IS I THINK THAT THE SCHOLAR YOU KNOW INSIDE HOW DO SERIES OF QUESTIONS RUNNING THE WHOLE TIME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DOES THIS PERSON KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT HE'S TELLING US HOW DOES HE KNOW ABOUT MOLLY HOW DOES HE KOW ABOUT THE AFFAIR HOW DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THE SUICIDE WHA DOES THE EVIDENCE BEHIND THE STORY SO OULDID YOU DECIDE TO DO ABOUT ALL THIS I DECIDED THAT I  HAD TO RESEARCH MOLLY STORY AND THE SRELL FAMILY AND THIS HOUS AND TO FIND OUT WHO SHE WAS SHE KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE EASY IF YOU KNOW A DOUBLE DEAT HAD HAPPENED RELATED TO A SEXUAL SCANDAL RELATED TO AN INTERATIONAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE WHITE FAMILY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO DISCLOSED IT RIGHT THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE TRIED TO KEEP THAT QUIET SO SHE STARTED WITH THE MORE ACCESSIBLE RECORDS AND TRIKE DOWN FRANCIS AND MATILDA E FOUND EVIDENCE SUGGESTING SHE DID KILLED HERSELF THOUGH NOT IN THAT HOUSE BUT TO CONFARMED THAT THEY OWN SOME ONE NAME MOLLY OR ANYONE IN THAT AGE RANGE FI STARTED OUT BY GOING TO STATEIN LOCAL HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS SHE COLNED THROUGH PURCHASE RECORDS OF PEOPLE THE SARRELLS AN SLAVE DON'T THROUGH NATIONAL AR CIVES AND SENC THES RECORDS OF A SLAVE FOLKS IN GEORGIA SCOURED LOCAL NEWSPAPERS FROM THAT TIME FOUND LETTERS FROM NEIGHBORS SHE EVEN DISCOVERED A MEMOIR BY ONE OF THE SARRELLE SONS AND AT THE END OF A YEAR OF EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH THERE WAS KNO MOLLY THAT'S THAT SAINT THAT OTOR THAT OTOR THAT WE GOT U TO STOP THIC AS I MEAN AFTER I MEOU JUST DESCRIBE TO ME THIS WHOLE DRAMA ABOUT MOLLY AND NOW YOU'RE LOOKING IN THESE RECORDS AND YOU DON'T SEE ANY RECORD LIKE THAT NO LIKE NO NAME OF MOLLY O NO NOT A SINGLE TRADE ON A SINGLE GROUN NOTHING NOTHING IF TI HAD TOLD ME THAT MOLLY STORY WAS EXAGGERATED IN CERTAIN WAYS I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISE BUT NO MOLLY BAT'S ACTUALLY A FICTION THAT SOMEBODY HAD CREADED AND WHAT I REALIZED THAT I FELT ENRAGED I FELT ENRAGED ABOUT THE NOTION THAT SOME ONE HAD ENRADE ALL THIS UP TYE WAS SO APPALLED THAT SHE DECIDED TO FIND OUT IF THIS WAS HAPPENING ANYWHERE ELSE TURNS OUT PLANTATIONS AND OLD MANSIONS ALL AROUND THE SOUTH GIVE TORS LIKE THIS AND SHE WENT ON AS MANY AS SHE COULD SHE DISCOVERED A WHOLE INDUSTRY BUILT AROUND FABRICATED STORIES HE STORICAL SIGHTS GINNED UP WITH VATE TALES OF MURDER AND TORTURE AND SHE WROTE A BOOK IT SPOSING THIS PART OF THE TORISM INDISTRY CALLED TALES FROM THE HAUNTED SOUTH HEARING THIS THOUGHT BACK TO MY TOR WITH THE PIRATE AND THAT STORY HE TOLD ABOUT THE SHOOTING OF EIGHT AN SLAVE PEOPLE BY HUMURCER THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT HAPPENED AND THOSE FINGER PRINTS OF THE ENSLAVED IN THE BRICKS WE WALKED ON BRICKS LIKE THAT DUE EXISTENCE OVANNA BUT PROBABLY NOT IN THAT LOCATION BUT IT'S NOT JIST THAT SO MUCH OF THI STUFF IS MADE UP THE CLOSER TIE LOOKED AT THESE COAST TORES THE MORE SHE SAW A DISTURBING PATTERN IN THE KINDS OF STORIES THE TORK I HAD TOL THEY WERE STORIES WERE IN SLAVE FOLKS BETRAYED THEIR MASTERS AR POISON THEIR MASTERS A SEDUCE THEIR MASTERS THE GORE AND SENSATIONALISM OF STUFF LIKE THIS ACTUALLY HIDES THE REALITIES A SLAVERY BY TURNING THE VICTIMIZERS THEIR MASTERS INTO VICTIMS IF HE LOOK AT THEM AS LITTLE MORAL FABLES THE MESSAGE OF THESE STORIES IS THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE IF EVERY ONE JUST STAYED IN THEIR PLACE TO TY IS BOOK TE BUNKY MOLLY CAME OUT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BUT WHEN WE TOOK THIS A RAIL WEAD HOUSE NIGHT TORE MOLLY STORY WAS STILL PRESENTED HIS FACT AND IT WAS THE FOCUSS OF THE TOR I WANT DID KNOW HOW THEY COULD JUSTIFIED WHY THEY STILL TELLING THIS LIE THE MANAGE OF THIS A RAL HOUSE AGREED TO TALK HIS NAME IS CALVAN PARKER AND I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT HE'S BLACK IT'S WORK AT THIS A RALE HOUSE ON AND OFF FOR TEN YEARS AND GIVES TORS HIMSELF BUT THE O THE HISTORICAL TORS THAT HAPPENED DURING THE DAYTIME AND THEY DON'T MENTION MOLLY THESE DAYS HE SAYS MOLLY ONLY GETS MENTIONED IN THE NIGHT TIME TORS AFTER WE DISCUSSED IM BASICS ABOUT THE HOUSE I GOT RIGHT TO THE POINT WHEN I TOOK THO TORE THE STUFF YALLA DONO IT WAS SO BUT REALLY SOME SENSITIVE AND ITTENT STUFF BUT I GOT TO SAY MAN IT SEEMS LIKE THIS STORY ABOUT MOLLY THAT WAS A HUGE PART OF THE TOR I TOOK IS NOT TRUE  WHAT'S WHAT TORTAGE YOU TAKE I'M OT TO THE NIGHT TOREIS THOUG WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT I  I DE IDEAL WITH MORE THE HISTORY PORTION OF THEM OF THE BUSINESS WE DON'T MENTION THAT WHOLE STORY BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK ITS THAS FACT TORAS MOST PEOPLE THINK IF IS OT

CAN'T REALLY BEEVEN BEGIN TO TESCRIBE HOW PERVAC OF THIS SPIRITUALESS RAGE WAS THIS IS DAVID JEER HISTORY WRITER WROTE A BOOK THAT DELVES DEEP INTO THIS WHOLE WORLD YOU HAD ALL THE NOF THESE GREAT AMERICAN SCIENCISTS WHO WERE TRYING A SUBSTANTIATE PROOF OF PSYCHIC PHENOMENON PROOF OF AN AFTER LIFE THE HARVARD PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT WERE ALL BUNCH OF GHOST CHASERS I'M IN THE HEAD OF A HARVARD

BLUSTERS MOVINGS AT RICHET WAS ACTUALLY A PHYSIOLOGIST AND WHILE YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD OF CHARLES RCHET OR ANY OF THE PSCIENTISTS WHO WERE SPIRITUALISTS RAN WITH SPIRITUALISTS THERE THESE TWO GUYS YOU DEFINITELY HAVE HEARD OF BOTH INCREDIBLY FAMOUS BACK THEN AND EVEN TO DAY WHO GOT SWEPT UP IN THIS MOVEMENT AND A WAY THAT CAME TO REALLY DEFIND THEIR LIVES THE FIRST IS THE WORLD RENOWNED MAGICIAN AND ESCAPE ARTIST HAIRY WHODINI AT THE TIME OF OUR STORY HE WAS GRIEVING THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY DE PARTED MOTHER AND THIS WAS NO ORDINARY MOTHER SON RELATIONSHIP HE WROTE ROMANTIC LETTERS TO HER USED TO REST HIS HEAD ON HER BOSOM WHEN HE WAS ANXIOUS AND WHEN HE WAS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD THIS BY THE WAY WAS BEFORE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE METIBLE COMPLEX THING AND HE WOULD NEVER REFER TO HER AS HIS MOTHER HE WOULD ALWAYS REFER TO HER AS A SAINTED MOTHER OR HIS BELOVED MOTHER HE OLD DOCTORO CALLED THUDENI T A LAST O THE GREAT MOTHER LOVERS SO HO DENIA DENIFIED WITH ALL THE BEREVED WHO WERE SEEKING CONTACT WITH DEAD LOVED ONES IDENTIFIED WITH BUT HE HAD A RALLY HARD TIME BELIEVING IN SPIRITUALISM IN THE SAME WAY AND FOR VERY VERY GOOD REASON HU DENI BEFORE HE BECAME A MAGICIAN HE ACTUALLY MADE A LIVING AS IS A FRAUD MEDIUM LIKE A FAC MENIA YAH NO KEN SO HE KNEW ALL THE TRICKS HE WAS IN A SENSE THE WORLD'S EXPERT ON SYCIC FRAT BUT YET AM HE WAS ALSO SEEKING THAT ONE SYCHIC WHO HE COULD BELIEVE WAS GENUALLY IN TOUCH WITH THE SPIRIT OF HIS MOTHER AND THIS IS ONE HE BEFRIEND SOR ATHOR CONAN DOYLE YES THE GUY WHO WROTE ALL THE SHERLOCK HOME STORIES HE'S THE OTHER FAMOUS EMIC FAMOUS GUY IN OUR STORY CONANDOILE LOST HIS SON HIS BROTHER LOTS OF THE MEN IN HIS FAMILY EITHER IN SOME WORLD WORE ONE BATTLE OR IN THE FLUE PANDEMIC AND DURING THE WAR A HE BELIEVED HE WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE SPIRITS OF HIS HIS HIS LOST LOVED ONCES A THROUGH HIS CHILDREN'S NANI WHO SUPPOSEDLY HAD PSYCHIC POWERS AND SHE WOULD HOLD THE SAANCE SAS AND HE BECAME A BELIEVER AND NOT JUST O BELIEVER BUT REALLY THE DEFACT O LIEDER OF THE SPIRITUALISM MOVEMENT HE MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH HIS PART HE TRAVEL ALL OVER THE PLACE GIVING PRESENTATIONS AND LECTURES ABOUT THE VIRTUES OF SPIRITUALISM WHICH LENT THE MOVEMENT A LOT OF CREDIBILITY HE WAS THI SGUY WHO HAD INVENTED THIS CHARACTER WHO WAS THE PINACL OF RATIONALITY IN DEDUCTIVE REASONING OF COURSE YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE HIM THE TIME OF DAY AND CONANDOLE ACKNOWLEDGED THE OTHER A LOT OF FAKE MEDIUMS OUT THERE BUT THEWRE LEGITIMATE ONES TOO HU DENI'S MOM HAD ALREADY BEEN DEAD FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE WHEN HE MET CONENDOI HE PRESENTED HIMSELF TO CONANDOIL AS A SEEKER AFTER THE TRUTH AND CONANDOYLE THOUGHT HE COULD HELP HIM TALK TO HIS DEAD MOTHER THEY CAME TO REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER IN NINETEEN TWENTY WHOU DENI TRAVEL TO THE UCA TO DO SOME SHOWS AND CNANDOLE SENT HIM AROUND TO ALL THESE MENIUMS THAT HE TRUSTED BUT WITH EVERY ONE OF THEM WHO DENI COULD SEE THE PUPET STRINGS BECAUSE AGAIN HE HAD PULLED THE SAME STONTS HIMSELF ONCE UPON A TIME AND HE CLAIMED TO HAVE ATTENDED A HUNDRED SANCE AS AND IN ENGLAND RIGHT LIKE ONE A DAYR YEN HUDENI HAD A TENTENCY TO HIS ACTERAT IA I DOUBT VERY MUCH IF HE HADTINTED A HUNTRED SIANCEIS BUT HE DID I SEE A NUMBER OF THESE MEDIUMS THAT CONANDOYL RECOMMENDED AND HE STRUCK OUT AND AND HE TOLD CONANDALL THAT AND CONANDOYLE THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE HUDENIE'S MENTAL STATE WITH SO TURBULENT THAT HE BASICALLY BLOCKED ANY ANY KIND OF POSSIBILITY OF AM PSYCHI COMMUNICATION WHEN HE PARTICIPATING THE SIANCE AS AND HE TOLLUDENI YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T PURSUE A SPIRIT THE WAYA TERRIER PURSUES A RAT WAY YOU'VE GOT TO COME IN QUIET AND RESEPTIVE AND SO HE THOUGHT HUDENI WAS TO BLAME FOR THUS WHICH OF COURSE HIS A CONVERSATION YOU HERE IN A LOT OF SPIRITUAL HOUSES IF YOU CAN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH A SPIRIT WHETHER DIVINE ERE JUST YOUR COUSIN SBECAUSE HE DON'T BELIEVE WELL ENOUGH THAT'S FORWARD A COUPLE OF YEARS NINETEEN TWENTY TWO CONANDOYLE COMES TO THE STATES TO

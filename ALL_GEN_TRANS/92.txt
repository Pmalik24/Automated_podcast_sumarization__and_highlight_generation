LIBRARY WHILE SOONS ARE TRYING TO STUDY FOR FINAL EXAMPTON FINISH THEIR TERM PAPERS DURING THE LAST TO WEEKS OF THIS MESTER WINNER LIBRARY IS OF COURSE A MASSIVE HISTORIC LIBRARY OVER HARVARD NIVERSIT AN MAZING MAZING PLACES THE FACT THAT ITS BEING DESTRUPTED DURING EXAMS IS PRETTY WHILE TH GANIAMAN AM NALUM OF HARVARD LALL AS A RESULT OF PRESIDENT GAZES FAILURE TO ENFORCE HARVARD'S OWN RULES AS ACTMEN JEWISH STUDENTS FACULTY AN OTHERS ARE FEARFUL FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY AS EVEN THE PHYSICAL ABUSIVE STUDENTS REMAINS UN PUNISHED PRESIDENT GAVES ABSURD EXPLANATION FOR THE LACK OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR THE OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH H B S INCIDENT WAS THAT THE UNIVERSITY CANNOT DISCIPLINE STUDENTS UNTIL THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY P D AND AF BEYINVESTIGATIONS ARE COMPLETE TO DATE I 'M UNAWARE OF ANY DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TAKEN FOR THE OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH INSTANT NEARLY TO MONTHS LATER PRESIDENT GAVES PRINCIPAL RESPONSE TO DDRESS ANTISEMITISM ON CAMPUS WAS TO SET UP A TASK FORCE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF ITS FORMATION RABBY WALL BE THE ONLY RABBI ON THE TASK FORCE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE HIS VESTIGATION FROM THE COMMITTEE PRESIDENT GAVES FAILURES SINCE I TOBER SEVENT LED TO CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF FOR CONDUCT THIS OUT COME ON ITS ON IS AN INCREDIBLE EMBARRASSMENT TO HARVARD I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY FORMER HARVARD PRESIDENT BEING THE SUBJECT OF CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CONGRESS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE PRESIDENT GAZE ENTIRED TESTIMONY WAS ABISMAL TO HIS DISRESPECTFUL AN CONDESCENDING TO CONGRESS HOS A HOSTILE WITNESTS UNWILLING TO ANSWER DIRECT QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS IN WORDSELL FOREVAR LIVIN IN FOME PRESID ENT CASE RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION DOES CAULING FOR THE JENTICIDE OF JUWS VIOLATE HARVARD'S RULES REGARDING BULLYING OR HARASSMEN PRESININGATS AD QUOTE IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTECT AND HE GOES ON TO TALK ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY ABOUT THE EVILS OF D E E PRACTICES THUSH WHO BE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION PRACTICES AT THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OF BELONGING WHICH FORMED UNDERGAS OVERSIGHT HE POINTS OUT THAT HERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS DISCRIMINATION AND HE SUGGESTS OF COURSE THAT THEY SEARCH FOR A NEW PRESIDENT HE IS RIGHT ABOUT ALL OF THAT NOW WILL SH BE OUTED I I HIGHLY DOUTED DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN UNCOVERED BY THE JOURNALIST CRIS RUFOS BEEN EXCELLENT ON UIVERSITY CAMPSES TAS WELL AS CRISBRUNET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THAT CLAUDING GAY IN HER P  C TS THISAPPARENTLY PLAGE RISED MULTIPLE SECTIONS BUT THAT APPARENTLY IS NOT ENOUGH GOING TO  GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO TO DISCREDIT HER EITHER RIGHT NOW THREE HUNDRED I GUES THE NUMBERS OF TO FIVE HUNDRED AS OF THIS MORNING FAKULT AT HARVARD ARE URGING AGAINST GAZE REMOVAL AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY ARE URGING AGAINST THAT REMOVAL IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HAND SOME SORT OF VICTORY TO A LEAST STOFANIC WHO'S THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS WOMAN FROM NEW YORK A MUNCH OF THE PROFESSORS ARE SUGGESTING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT GA REMAIN BECAUSE AFTER ALL SHE IS VERY DIVERS AND SHE DOES REPRESENTS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WILLGET'S THAT IN JUST

EMBATTLED LEADERS WHY COULDN'T THOSE LEADERS HAVE SIMPLY CONDEMN CHANCE LIKE FROM THE RIVER TO THE S PALISTINE WILL BE FREE OR THERE'S ONLY ONE SOLUTION INTOFATO REVOLUTION BOTH OF WHICH OUR GENISITL CALLS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF JURY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION AF TO ANSWER WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PURPOSE OF HIER EDUCATION AF THIS POINT OBVIOUSLY UNIVERSITY SERVE A PURPOSE THAT WOULN'T HAVE STUCK AROUND THIS LONG IF THEY HADN'T T THAT PURPOSE HAS SHIFTED OVER TIME ORIGINALLY TO GO BACK TO THE MDDLE AGES UNIVERSITYS WHER NEXTENSION OF CHURCH EDUCATION THOSE WHO COMPLETED WHAT WAS CALLED THE TRIVIUM GRAMMAR RHETERIC AND DIALECTICS DIALECTICS IS LOGIC AND THE QUADRIVIUM MATH GEOMETRY MUSIC AN ASTRONOMY MOVEDON T UNIVERSITYES OVER TIME UNIVERSITIES INVOLVED INTO CENTERS OF LEARNING IN WHICH SCHOLARS WOULD PASSALONG AGE OLD WISDOM AND SEARCH FOR NEW ANSWERS CITIZENS WHO WENT TO UNIVERSITY ERE EXPECTED TO BECOME LEADERS IN THEIR FIELDS AND TO BE INCULCATED IN THE VALUES OF THEIR SOCIETIES AT THE SAME TIME OVER TIME HOWEVER THE CENTUALIZATION OF ATS SEPARATE INTELLECTUAL CLASS LED UNIVERSITIES DOWN TU PATHS THE FIRST PATH TOWARDS SPECIALIZATION IN INDUSTRY THE PREPARATION OF A PROFESSIONAL CLASS THE REASON THT YOU NEED DEGREE IN ORDER TO SERVE AS A SCIENTISTS ORAS A LAWYER FOR EXAMPLE THE SECOND PATH WAS TOWARD SOCIAL EXPERIMENTATION NOW THE PATH TOWARD PROFESSIONAL SPECIALIZATION HAS BEEN QUITE OFTEN VERY POSITV TO GET A LOT OF VERY BRILLIANT MINDS INNER ROOM TALKING PHYSICS OR CAN GET BETTER RESULTS THAN IF THEY WERE JUST ALL OVER THE CONTINENT SOMEWHERE OBVIOUSLY THE SCIENCE EMINATING FROM OUR UNIVERSITIES HAS CHANGED THE WORLD AND IT CONTINUES TO DO SO WHICH IS WHY WHEN WE ARE U SE A LI THE PEOPLE WERE RECALLED SOUTH CAMPUS MAJORS THOSE WHO BE THE SCIENCE MAJORS WERE CONSIDERED THE USEFUL PEOPLE BUT ALL THIS IS ALSO MENT AN INCREASING CREDENTIALIZATION OF SOCIETY IN WHICH UNIVERSITY DEGREE IS CONSIDERED AN ONTRICT TO THE WORK FORCE ALTOGETHER BECAUSE AGAIN THOSE DEGREES WERE NOT RESTRICTETS BEING IN THE SCIENCES THEY ARE AN EXTENDED OUT TO THE LIBERAL ARTS THE SECOND PATH SOCIAL EXPERIMENTATION HAS BEEN THE WAY OF UNIVERSITIES SINCE AT LEAST THE MIDNINETEENTH CENTURY AS RELIGION STARTED TO FADE IN WESTERN LIFE AND AS UNIVERSITIES INCREASINGLY BECAME BATTLE GROUNDS FOR VARIOUS REPLACEMENT THEORIES SOCIAL EXPERIMENTATION BECAME VAKE PURPOSE OF THE UNIVERSITY NEW THEORIES THEAR VERY FANCY THEORIES OF LIVING FROM BUROCRATIC CENTURALIZATION GERMAN PROGRESSIVISM TO BROADENING OF SOCIAL RIGHTS SPRANG FROM UNIVERSITIES UNIVERSITIES BECAME THE SEED BEDS OF SOCIAL CHANGE THE NEW PURPOSE OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN GENERAL WAS WELL SUMMED UP BY THE THEORIST JOHN DUY WHOSE CONSIDER ONE MOST IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHERS OF ALL TIME THOSE AN EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY PROGRESSIVE VERY MUCH ON THE LEFT HE ARGUED UNIVERSITIES WERE DESIGNED TO CREATE A PROGRESSIVE CITIZEN A CITIZEN READY TO TAKE PART IN THE REBUILDING OF A GREAT STATE UNBOUND BY HISTORY AND RELIGION AS DO WE SAID QUOTE EDUCATION HAS TO UNDERMINE AND DESTROYED THE ACCUMULATED AND SELF PERPETUATING PREJUDICES OF LONG AGES WHEN SOCIAL LIFE IN GENERAL HAS BECOME MORE REASONABLE MORE IMBUED WITH RATIONAL CONVICTION LESS MOVED BY STIFF AUTHORITY AND BLIND PASSION EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES MAY BE MORE POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE THAN AT PRESIDENT THEN THEY WILL WORK IN HARMONY WITH THE EDUCATIVE INFLUENCE EXERCISED WILLY NILLY BY OTHER SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS UPON AN INDIVIDUAL'S HABITS OF THOUGHTS AND BELIEF EXPERT YOU SEE WOULD GUIDE THE LIFE OF THE NATION THIS WAS EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY PROGRESSIVISM YOU SEE IT AT THE TOP LEVELS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO DAY THAT PHILOSOPHY SOR OF TOP DOWN INTELLIGENCEO RULE WAS NOT RELEGATED TO THE UNINTED STATES FAR FROMINT DO E'S OWN THOUGHT WAS AN OUTGROWTH OF GERMAN PROGRESSIVISM WERE SIMILAR IDEAS WERE DOMINANT IT'S NO WONDER THE GERMAN UNIVERSITIES ACTUALLY REPRESENTED A CENTERE OF POWER FOR HITLER AS HISTORIAN NEEL VERGISON WRITES THE SWEEKGO ND QUOTE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES BY FARTHE BEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD WERE IN GERMANY GERMAN ACA DEMICS ACTED AS HITLERS THINCTANG PUTTING POLICY FLESH ON THE BONESOF HIS RACISTIDEOLOGY THE INTELLIGENCIATH AS NEEL POINT OTH ALSO OF AN UGLY HABIT OF CRETING COALITIONS OF THE SUPPOSEDLY DISPOSSESSED TO ACT AS SHOP TROOPS FOR THEIR NEW IDEAS CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE CASE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN UNIVERSITIES IN THE WEST WERE REACTING NOT AGAINST THE SUPPOSED HANDCUFFS OF GOD AND THEOLOGY AND RELIGION BUT NOW AGAINST THE SUPPOSED EVILS OF NATIONALISM NOW THE UNIVERSITIES WOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARD A NEW SORT OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING TOWARD GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP IN WHICH THE ATAMIZED INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE THE PRIMOVER SO LONG AS THAT INDIVIDUAL DECLARED FIALTY TO THE ENDTELLECTUAL MOVEMENT OF THE TIME THUS EIR BER MARCUSA WAS ONE OF THE PROGENITORS OF THE SO CALLED NEW LEFT IN THE SIXTIES POSITED ON UNIVERSITY CAMPSSIS TEACHING FROM BERKLY A FREE SEX LIFE STYLE IN ORDER TO CREATE A NON REPRESSIVE CIVILIZATION HE PREACHE THE END OF CAPITALISM WHICH OF COURSE HAD LED TO WESTERN POWER AND NATIONALISM IN WHAT HE CALLED FACHISM THE ARGUED FOR THE BANNING OF ALTERNATIVE VIEWPOINTS WHICH STOOD AGAINST TOLERANCE FOR HIS CAUSEHE CALLED THIS REPRESSIVE TOLERANCE TOLERANCE THAT OPPRESSES NON TOLERANT IDEAS NO WONDER REVOLUTIONARY STUDENTS DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT PERISTUDENT REVOLT CARRIED BANNERS READING MARKS MAU AND MARCUSA THE CHAOS IN TE STREETS OF THE WESTDERING THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WAS BORN IN THE UNIVERSITIES OF THE WEST WHALL TO DAY'S UNIVERSITIES PROMOTE A NEW SORT OF SOCIAL EXPERIMENT THIS EXPERIMENT IS CALLED DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION UNLIKE IS MORE BRASH AND OPEN PREDECESSORS D I MAKES FAR MORE HUMBLE CLAIMS AT LEAST PUBLICLY DO DOWNERS THEY WANT FREE LAW OR EVOLUTIAN OR PASSIVISM THEY SIMPLY WANT MORE DIVERSITY MORE INCLUSION THEY WANT THAT IN THE ENTIRE BODY POLITIC THEY WANT MORE EQUITY MODELED BY THE UNIVERSITIES OF COURSE BUT HERE'S THE THING THE SAME PEOPLE WHO STOOD BEHIND THE OLD REVOLUTION STAND BEHIND THE NEW REVOLUTION D I IS THE RESULT OF SOMETHING ALLED CRITICAL FHURY A BELIEF THAT ALL SYSTEMS OF POWER ARE REFLECTIONS NOT OF MERIT BUT OF EXPLOITATION THAT ALL HIERARCHIES ARE NOT REFLECTION OF PEOPLE BEING GOOD AT THINGS AND PEOPLE BEING BAD THINGS BUT OF THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP HURTING THE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM TAN THE ONLY CORRECTIVE TO THAT EXPLOITATION IS TO COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURE THOSE SYSTEMS OF POWER BY APPEAL TO GROUP IDENTITY AND COALITIONAL POLITICS PUT TOGETHER A COALITION OF THE DISPOSSESSED TO OVERTURN THE HIERARCHY IN THIS VIEW ANY ONE SUCCESSFUL MUST BE DENIGRATED AS EVIL IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL NOT CA YOU GOOD O THINGS ITS BIOUR BAD PERSON ANY ONE UNSUCCESSFUL MUST BE UPHELD AS GOOD BECAUSE OF COURSE THEIR VICTIM OF THE EVIL SYSTEM THIS OPPRESSOR OPPRESSED BINERY IS TH MOTIVATING FEATURE OF LIFE ON CAMPUS TO DAY IT IS THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY AN IT RESULTS IN OPPRESSION AND DISCRIMINATION JUST AS SURELY AS THE GERMAN UNIVERSITIES REVOLUTIONARY IDEA RESULTED IN OPPRESSION AND DISCRIMINATION IN BOTH CASES THAT RESULTED IN DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE JEWS ALWAYS THAT IS WHY THE PRESIDENTS OF MAJOR UNIVERSITIES STRUGGLED TO ANSWER BASE O QUESTIONS ABOUT ANTISEMITISM IN FRONT OF CONGRESS THIS NEW PHILOSITHY IS FOCASED ENTIRELY ON THAT OPPRESSOR OPPRESSED BINARY THAT BINARY CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO FALL FOR IF IT FALLS THEN SO DOES THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION THE ENTIRE IDEA LOGICAL EDIFICE THAT ACTS AS THE BASES FOR THE REVOLUTION AGAINST IN AMERICAN MARITOCRACY IF A FEW JEWS NEED BE THREATENED WITH UASTICAS AND LIMINATION TO PRESERVE D I WILL THE THATUATS CAN HAVE TO GO D I IS THE PURPOSE OF THE UNIVERSITIES A NDERSTAND IT IS NOT JO SOMETHING UNIVERSITIES DO IT IS WHAT UNIVERSITIES ARE IS THE CENTER OF WHY THEY EXIST TO DAY IT IS NOT A MEANS TOWARD AN END IT IS IN FACT THE GOAL THE RESTRUCTURING OF SOCIETY BECAUE THE GOAL IS ALWAYS PERPETUAL REVOLUTION BY THE ENTELLIGENCIA AND D  I IS THE CURRENT REVOLUTION IT IS THE ENTIRE PETAGOGY MEANING THE WAY OF TEACHING IN THE WORDS OF POWLO FRERRY WHOSE THE CHIEF FORCE BEHIND SO CALLED CRITICAL PETAGOGY QUOTE WASHING ONE'S HANDS OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE POWERFUL AND POWERLESS MEANS TO SIDE WIT THE POWERFUL NOT TO BE NEUTRAL AND THAT CANNOT BE ALLOWED AND SO D  I MUST BE PROTECTED AND THA'S WHAT YOUR WACHING TO DAY FROM EVERY ARENA OF THE LEFT THE ATTEMPT TO PROTECT D YI IT HAS TO BE DONE ILL GET'S THAT JUST ONE

UNIVERSITY JEWISH ANSTIDEA REPORTING ON THIS APPARENTLY THERE'S CONTROVERSY THT'S BREAKING OUT WHY BECAUSE THERE IS A NEWLY FORMED ANTI SEMITISM COMMITTEE AT STAND FOR UNIVERSITY RIGHT TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE JEWS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND OF COURSE THE REASON DISCRIMINATION IS HAPPENING AGAINST JUS THE UNIVERSITY IS THE SAME RES IN THE DISCRIMINATION HAS BEEN HAPPENING AGAINST T ASIENT AMERICAN APPLICANS TO UNIVERSITIES WHICH IS THE JEWS ARE CONSIDERED DISPROPORTIONATELY SUCCESSFUL IN THE HIERARCHY OF OF OPPRESSION THEREFORE THEY CAN'T BE INCLUDED IN THE OPPRESSED COALITION SO APPARENTLY THE FACULTY COACHURE OFTH COMMTEIS O PERSONING T ARY KELLMAN WHOSE AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN STANDFORT'S GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND RELIGIOUS STUDIES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YOU WROTE A PAPER WITH OTHER STANDFORD FACULTY MEMBERS IS ALLED SAFE ON THE SIDELINES AND HE SAID ANTISEMITISM WAS NOT A PROBLEM ON COLLEGE CAMPASSES BECAUSE QUOTE DIFFERENT REPRESENTATION OF CAMPIS CULTURE COME FROM THE DIFFICULTIES IN DEFINDING WHAT COUNTS IS POLITICAL SPEECH AND WHAT COUNTS IS ANTISEMITISM IS THE ENTIRE THING WHEN YOU'RE YELLING ABOUT HOW JEWS SHOULD BE WIPED OUT THAT IS JUST A A FORM OF POLITICAL SPEECH THIS IS WHAT QUAUDIN GAY AND THE RESC OF THSE IDIOTS MENT WHAT THEY MEAN AND THE NOT IT IT'S THE SMART THERE'SN' THEIR NEFARIAS WHAT THEY MEAN IS THAT IT IS A FORM OF POLITICAL SPEECH TO CALL FOR THE WIPING OUT OF THESE SO CALLED OPPRESSOR CLASS AND THE JEWS ARE PART OF THE OPPRESSOR CLASS THAT'S WHAT KELLMAN IS SAYING HERE TO HE'S ALSO AN AGENTS ON THE INSIDE HE SERVED ON THE ACANEMIC BOARD AVE CALLED OPEN HELLO SO HELLO INTERNATIONAL IS A JEWISH SUPPORT GROUP ON CANVAS BASILY WERE STUDENTS WHEN I WAS AT HARVARD IIT'S IT'S A PLACE WHERE WHERE YE GOT LIK GET AMEAL AND ITS WHERE THEY HAVE SABBATH SERVICES AND ALL THE REST WHILE HELLO INTERNATIONAL IS PRO ISRAEL AND THIS PERSON HAS BEEN WORKING TO OPEN UP HELLELL INTERNATIONAL TO WILDLY ANTI ISRAEL EVENTS BECAUSE OF COURSE HE IS ANTI ISRAEL NO SHOCK THERE SO THAT IS JUST ONE CONTROVERSY THAT IS BREAKING OUT AND THE MEDIA OF COURSE ARE FULLY INVESTED IN THE CONTINUATION OF D E I A DR IT IS TRULY AMAZING SO THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLE O THIS CAME CURTESY OF THE LEAST FUNNY  SHOW ON TALIVISION SETURNAYT LIVE SO SETURNAE LIVE OPEN THIS WEEK WITH A SKIT ABOUT THIS CONGRESSIONAL HEARING NOW THI SUIT THIS PRETTY RICH TERRITORY RIGHT THIS A RICH VAIN TO MINE YOU HAVE THREE UNIVERSITY PRESEDENTS ALL OF WHOM ARE SUPPOSEDLY INTELLECTUALS WHO CAN'T ANSWER ABASIC QUESTION SO WAS ASANEL SKIT ABOUT THE STUPIDITY OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION OFFICIALS OR WAS IT ABOUT HOW ELEAST STEPHANIC THE PERSON ASKING VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS WAS THE BAD PERSON OH YOU KNOW THE ANSWER OF THIS ONE BECAUSE THE CAST OVERTASANEL THE WRITERS THE HIGHER UPS THERE TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE D E I REVOLUTION S NATMEANS THE VILLAIN IN THIS PESE IS STEPHANIC HEREGO NOW I GET AS TOT SCREAMING CUASTIN THAT THE LAMIN LIKE IM BALLY I CAN IN FAR FN YE     T FHIVED WALLA TE CAN FOM E CONTACT WHAT E THAT CAN'T BE YOUR ANSA YOU PANMATI SIN KRAST YES O NOW WELL WE ARE TERI ABOU TAIN ALL FORMS TRD ANTEETETANEFLAMAFOO  BTHE T INE AND MI TALATIN TA FO FEL AND KEEP IN MINE IF YOU DON'TA E YOU GEN TO MAKE MA LOK GOOD WIT TIS REALLY REALLY HAD TOTAL  SO THE ENTIRE SKIT AGAIN MAKES THE PROTECTING T UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE OF THAT THEY CANNOT EVEN GET A LAUGH AT THE EXPENSE OF UNIVERSITY PRESEDENCE BECAUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE UNIVERSITY PRESDENTE ARE IN MASHED IN AN IDEOLOGY THAT IS EVIL WOULD MEAN TO UNDERMINE THE VERY BASIS FOR SO MUCH OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COLITION NOW DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD EMBRACE JUST A BROADER A GENDA AND THE GEND OF THE USED TO BE WHAT WAS CALLED LIKE THE JOHN EDWARDS CANVAGENDA TH TWO AMERICA IS MORKAN CLASS BASED A GENDA AS OPPOSED TO THE RACIALLY BASED O GENDA THAT IS D E I BUT THEY WON'T DO THAT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT SINCE TWENTY TWELVE SINCE BARAKABOMMA ON AN TWENTY TWELVE THE EMOCRATSO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE CREATED A COALITION OF THE OPPRESSED THAT IS ELECTORALLY UNDER F EATABLE WHICH IS WILD SINCE THEY LOST IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT THEYE GIN TO KEEP PUSHING THIS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S GIN O KEEP MOVING ALONG WITH THIS WHICH IS WHY OF COURSE THE HEADLINE FROM THE YOR TIME TOS QUOT AS FURY ERUPT TO OVER CAMPASANTITEMITISM CONSERVATIVES SEIZE THE MOMENT WOW  SO MUCH SEIZING MY FAVORITE BRAND OF OF NOUR TIMES JOURNALISM IS THE REPUBLICAN NOTICE HEADLINE REPUBLICANS NOTICE DEMOCRATS KILL BABY REPUBLICANS NOTICE DEMOCRATS PRO ANTI SEMITISM REPUBLICAN'S NOTICE YES THOUG THE REAL HEADLINE THERE IS REPUBLICANS NOTICING SO QUESTION FROM ALL OF THIS IS WHAT IS THE LIKELY NEXT OUTCOME GOING TO BE WILL GET TO THAT IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAY OFF TEUMES RENOUNCE LAST WEEK WHICH MEANS NOW IS THE PERFECT TIMES TO JOIN PRIZEPICS EVEN IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW COLLEGE FOOTBALL PRIZE PICS OFFERS PROCJECTIONS ON PRETTY MUCH EVERY SPORT THERE IS EN B A M ELL BE ANNA FELL AND CHALL PEGIE COLLEGE SPORTS ESE PORTS AN ASKKAR TENNIS AND A MADE TISCULF WHATEVER YOU ARE INTO PRIEPICTS IS

PRIZE PICTS IS THE ONLY DAILY FANCYSPORS PLATFORM WITH INJURY INSURANCE SO PRODUCER JAKE BIG FOOTBALL IN BASKEBALL FAN AN PRIZEPICS ALOWS JAKE TOU ENJOY HIS WEEKGAINST BY MAKING ENTRIES ON HIS

PRIZE PICTSTOKCIMS SLASHMEN PROMOCO BEN FOR TO POSA MATCH UP TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS OCASE SO WHAT IS THE OUTCOME OF ALL THIS LIKELY TO BE SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE D  I AGENDA BECAUSE IT IS BAD ACTUALLY'S QUITE HORRIBLE IT'S NOT GOING O BE ENOUGH O JUST FIER A FEU OF THE PRECEDENTS THAT'S NOT ENOUGH IF THEYARE THEN REPLACE WITH PRECEDENCE PHOT TEMPT TO CUON QUAT BROAHT IN OUT D  I THIS WHOLE SYSTEM HAS FAIL SO FIRST OF ALL D YI CANNOT ACTUALLY BE BROADENED OUT TO INCLUDE SA ASIEN AMERICANS AN JUWS BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD BE TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE OPPRESSION HIERARCHY AND TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO EXPLODE THE OPPRESSION HIERARCHY BECAUSE JUES AND ATIONS ARE TO SUCCESSFUL AS HE CAN'T DO THAT BUT LET'S SAY THEY TRY LET'S SAY THAT THEY TRY TO PUT A FRIENDLY FACE ON THIS THE WAY THAT'S GOING TO WORK IS WITH MORE SPEECH RESTRICTIONS ON CAMPUS S THEY'R TWO WAYS THAT DIS CAN GO WAY THIS CAN GO NUMBER ONE IS THAT YOU COULD JUST EXPLODE THE D YIGENDA WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO BE COME LESS SENSITIVE ON CAMPUS IT WOULD MEAN THET YA YOU CAN CHANCE SOME REALLY BAD STUFF ABOUT YUS BUT IT WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT YOU COULD SAY SOME YOU KNOW REASONABLE THINGS LIKE BOYS ARE NOT GIRLS ON CAMP AS ITHOUT BEING DRAGGED INTO THE DEAN'S OFFICS THE COULD BE QUOG FAT FOBIC BY MENTIONING THAT BEING OVER WEIGHT IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH WITHOUT BEING DRAGGED INTO THE DEAN'S OFFIS IN OTHER WORDS THE ANSWER TO THIS WOULD BE TO GET RID OF D Y ENTIRELY AN THAT IS THE BETTER SOLUTION DO YOU THINK THEY'E GON TO GO FOR THAT OR THEY GN TO GO FOR MORE SPEECH COES THESE MORE CONTROL IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER FROM PEOPLE WHO LOVE  CONTROL AH YOU GUESSTID OBVIOUSLY THE MEDIA AND MEMBERS OF THE I NTELLIGENIA ARE TRYING TO MOVE ALONG WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY NEED TO BE MORE CONTROLS OVER SPEECH SEE THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS SAID THE OTHER DAY THEY WERE MAKING THE ARGUMENT THE FREE SPEECH MEANS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CHANG ENICIDL SLOGANS AGAINST JUWS I'D BE OPEN TO THAT ARGUMENT I REALLY WOULD IF I HAD NOT BEEN BAND FROM HALF THE COLLEGE CAPASSES IN AMERICA I'D BE OPEN TO THAT ARGUMENT IF A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE HAD NOT BEEN BANNED FROM COLLEGE CAMPASSES INCLUDING STUDENTS THE SAME UNIVERSITY THAT'S SAID THAT CILL CASHO THE STUDENT AT PARKLAND WHO IN A GROUP TAX WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD WROTE A RACIAL SLUR HAD BE BAND FROM HARVARD BECAUSE HE COULDN'T BE ADMITTED BECAUSE OF THAT THAT SAME UNIVERSIIE SAYS THAT YOU CAN CHANT GENECITL SLOGANS ON CAMPAS TYE CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS IF THE IDEA IS THAT THIS STOUBLED STANDARD IS WHAT IS TO PREVAIL WILL JUST THE AD JEWS TO THE DOUBLE STANDARD THASN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT ALL IN FACT IN MANY WAYS IT MAKES THE PROBLEMS WORSE BECAUSE AGAIN THE HYPOCRISY IS PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE AND YET THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT IS BEING CALLED FOR BY WAIT FOR IT THE INTELLIGENCIA SA PERSONAMED CLEAR O FINKLE STINE IN ALGENON BIDDLE PROFESSOR OF LAW AND PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AT UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIASIAS A PIECE TITLED TO FIGHT ANTICEMITISM ON CAMPASSES WE MUST RESTRICT SPEECH THAT'S O THE WASHINGTON POST SHE SAS THE VALUE OF FREE SPEECH HAS BEEN ELEVATED TO NEAR SACRED LEVEL ON UNIVERSITY CAMPASSES WHICH IS A JOKE THAT IS A LIE IS NOT TRUE AT ALL BUT SHE SAYS AS ARES ULT UNIVERSITIES HAVE HAD TO TOLERATE HATE SPEECH EVEN HATESPEECH CALLING FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS MINORITIES UNIVERSITY PRESSIENS I RESISTING THIS CONCLUSION  RATHER THAN CONFRONT THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE OMMITMENT TO FREE SPEECH AND THE COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATING THE HOSTILE IN VIRONMENT FACING JEISH STUDENTS ON CAMPAS MANY SIMPLY AFFIRM TEIR COMMENTMENT TO BOTH OR BY TIME BY SETTING UP TASK FORCES STUDY THE PROBLEM COUNTERING SPEECH WITH MORSPEECH MIGHT JUST MEAN ADDING TO THE HATEFUL RETERIC ON CAMPASS AND WOULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM SO INSTEAD THIS PERSON AT RECOMMENDS THAT UNIVERSITIES SHUT DOWN MORE SPEECH UNIVERSITIES HAVE A DUTY UNDER TITLE SIC OF THE CIVILRIZE ACT TO ENSURE THEIR CAMPASSES DO NOT TO SEND INTO QUONICED HOSTILE IN VIRONMENTS THAT A FACTIVELY EXCLUDE STUDENTS OF ETHNIC WRELIGIOUS OR RATIAL MINORITIES FROM RECEIVING THE BENEFIT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ON CAMPUAS IN FACT PEN HAS ALREADY BEEN SUED BY TWO JEWISH STUDENTS ELEGING THE UNIVERSITY HAS BECOME AN INCUBATION LAD FOR VIRULENT ANTEDUISH HATRED THE OPEN EXPRESSION AND ACONEMIC FREEDOM OUR CRITICALLY IMPORTANT VALUES IN HIGHER EDUCATION SAYS THIS PROFESSOR THERE ARE OTHER VALUES THE UNIVERSITIES MUST PROMOTE AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE ENCOURAGING CIVIL DIALOGUE E CROSS DIFFERENCIS AT SUTTER NOW SEY NON BELIEVE TH UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEN PROMOTING THE STUFF NO THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN MARACCUSAS STYLE REPRESSIVE TOLEMENS FOR LITERALLY MY ENTIRE LIFETIME AND LONGER AND NOW IT'S ONLY NOW THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT OH BY THE WAY FREE SPEECH MATTERS WHEN YOU'RE YELLING AT JEWS IT'S THE DOUBLE STANDARD THAN EVERYBODY'S NOTICING AND THE AMAZING SOLUTION FROM PEOPLE ON THE LEFT IS WHAT IF WE RESTRICTS WHAT IF WE PUT MORE RESTRICTIONS ON SPEECH THEY WILL NOT LET GO OF THE D E IE WITHOUT A FIGHT THEY WILL NOT DO IT THIS IS WHY YOU'R SEEING OVER UNIVERSITY OF WAS CONSENT INSANE BATTLE RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITIES OF WISCONSIN AND THE REPUBLICAN STATE THE REPUBLICAN LED STATE LEGISLATURE SO THE REPUBLICANS IN THE WISCONSIN LEGISLATURE THEY WANTED TO CURB D  I FUNDING THE BOARD OF REGIONS HAD AGREED TO VOTE ON A DEAL BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY WISCONSIN LEADERSHIP AND ASSEMBLY SPEAKER ROBIN VOSS THEY WULD FREEZE AND CAP D I HIRING AND EXCHANGE FOR FUNDING HELD UP BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT THEN THE BORD OF UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN REJECTED THAT THAT PROPOSAL NINE TO EIGHT THEY LEFT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAC PAIRFUNNING OF THE

COM SLASH SUBSCRIBE ON CAN MEANWHILE SPEAKING ON FREE SPEECH SAGAIN WHAT THE LEFT ONCE ON CAMPASSES IS LESS FREE SPEECH BECAUSE THIS WILL SOMEHOW MAKETHINGS BETTER AND THAT OF COURSE IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE IT ENDS OP BEING FREESPEECH FOR SOME BUT NOT FOR OTHERS WHICH BRINGS US TO ALECJONES SO OVER THE WEAKEN OULON MUSK UNBAND ALECJONES ON AX THAT WAS THE RIGHT MOVE IT WAS IN FACT PEOPLL FORGET THIS BECAUSE OF THE ONLINES BUT WAY BACK WHEN INTO DOSENTATIN WHEN ALEJONES WAS BAND FROM SOCIAMEDIA I ACTIVELY STOOD UP FOR ALECJONES I THINK THAT ALECS JONES SHOULD NOT BE BAND FROM APPLE AN THEY SPOKE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE STANDARDS THAT ARE BEING USED BY THE LOT OF THE SOCIAL MENIA COMPANIES ARE EXTRAORDINARILY VAGUE PROBLEM IS THIS ONCE YOU START SAYING THAT HATESPEECHES ARASTION OLF FOR BANTING PEOPLE FROM SOCIAL MENIA YOU GET INTO SOME VERY VERY VAGUE TERRITORY BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THE LEFT DOES NOT HAVIN CONSISTEN STANDARD THE DAY UPHOLD WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT HATESPEE SO HE THOSE BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTY AIND TWENTY EIGHTEN WHEN HE WAS BAND AND HE WAS BAND APPARENTLY OVER FOLLOWING AROUND TO SAN AND REPORTER AND CAN HARASSING THE REPORTER ASKING QUESTIONS THAS WHO REALLY RIDICULOUS REASON TOBAND HIM FROM TWITTER UT TWITTER WAS DOING TH SORT OF STUFF ROUTINELY AND IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY TERRIBLE BECAUSE THEY UN PERSONED HIM ALL AT ONCE NOW AGAIN IT'S HARD TO FIND LESS OF AN ALECJONES FAND THAN IAM THE SORT OF SWAFF PEDDLING OF ALEJONES THE TUCKOR CARLSON DID ON HIS EX SHO THE OTHER DAY I'VE AGHWAYS ABSURD  ALEC JONES DID FOUR YEARS PROMOTE A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT SANDY HOOK WAS A FALSE FLAG ATTACK IN ORDER TO TO A GUN GRAB AND THAT THE RE CRASIS ACTORS WERE BEING INVOLVED IN THAT THING O    I E  E   I    E Y I I    I  I O  I  Y    Y      I I I  M IE O    I  N EN  I    WAR   Y    BUT IT TOO ME ABOT YEARE SHANTY  COM THE GRIPSH UT THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE THING STR THE WHOLE THING I I MAIN EVEN I O ABLYI I THA JUMP ON USE THE I US  O O E  TO DEEPREESHAN MIJOTI JU ORY IDIDL ALECS JONES PROMOTED THE PEATZIGATE CONSPIRACY THEORY WHICH SUGGESTED H DHERESOME SORPETIFILE RING BEING RUN OUT OF COMIT PINGPONG PEATS OREA IN WASHINGTON D C AND ONE OF HIS LISTENERS THEN WENT CRAZY AND DECIDE TO SHOOT THE PLACE UP NOWT'S NOT AS ON ALECJONES FALL BHESE ALICJONES IN TOME TO SHOOT THE PLACE UP BUT HE WAS PROMOTING THAT CONSPIRACY THEORY AND THEN HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR I WILL WARN YOU I THE STORY IS FOR THE BIGGEST THING OIN AT IS A RABITHOL THAT IS HORRIFYING TO GO NOW NOW THIS IS TIED INTO PEDASTO WITH THOUSANDS OF BEMOL WHICH YOU LACE TO COME OUT WITH PUT DASTO GOING TO RETUALS WHERE THEY DRANK BLOD IS THE KENNIST OF ALE JONES AS ROUTINELY THE ATTEMPT TO TURN HIM INTO A VOICE OF REASON IS CONTRA TOWHAT ALECJONES HIMSELF HAS SAID IN HIS STANDYHOOK LAWSUIT HE LITERALLY SAID I ACT A PART WHEN I'M ON MY SHOW AND I SAY THINGS I DO NOT THINK ARE TRUE ON MY SHOW IN ORDER TO ACT THAT PART HOW'SE HIS DEFENSE GAY SO IS IS NOT A DEFENSE IF ALEC JONES AS A HUMAN BEING BECAUSE FRANKLY I DON'T THINK ALEC JHONES IS TOTALLY WORTH OFFENDING AS A HUMAN BEING BUT I ALSO DON'T THINK THAT EVERYBODY THAT I AGREE WITH THAT'S THE STANDARD FOR BEING ON ATS I ONLY AS THE STANDRDFOR BEING ON SOCIAL MEDIU NHOW I'VE ARGUED THT PEOPLE I THNG ARE A LOT WORSE THAN ALEC JONES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA HECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU HAVE A GATE KEEPER THAT GATE KEEPER IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM THE GATE PKKEEPER YET YOU BETTER TRUST THAT GATE KEEPER A LOT AND I DON'T I'M TRUST ANY THESE GATE KEEPERS VERY MUCH ANDSO I'D RATHER HAVE A PLATFORM LIKE ACTS WITH ALECS JONES ON IT AND OTHER RIDICULOUS HUMAN BEINGS LIKE SULAME ON OCMEN WHO'S A LIAR WITH REGARD TO FOR EXAMPLE THE ISRAEL GOSSIC CONFLICT I'D RATHER HAVE THOSE PEOPLE ON ACTS THEN NOT HAVE THEM ON ACTS BECAUSE FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THAT I'M THE SOLE REPOSITORY OF ALL TRUTH NOR DO I THINK THAT EVEN IF I'M RIGHT ALL THE TIME WHICH OF COURSE I MAY OF COURSE I THINK THAT NOR DO I THINK THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO VIEW OTHER OPINIONS SO MUSK OVER THE WEKGET AN UNBAND ALECS JONES HE ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS BAD FOR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT IS AND A HERE WAS MUSK THEN HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH ALE JONES ABOUT ALL OF THIS NOW I WILL SAY DO I THINK THAT'S A SMART PIAR MOVE BY YOU ON MUSK TO DO SOME SORT OF CONVERSATION WITH ALE JHONES I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN KIND BETWEEN OF COURSE YOUR LA USE MY PLATFORM AND I PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON AND CERTAINLY THE RICHEST PERSON ON EARTH AND WHEN I HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU SORT OF ALLOWING YOU TO SOFT PETL ALL OF YOUR RIDICULOUS AND LUDICROUS NONSENSE I DON'T THINK THOSE OF THE SAME THING AT ALL I THINK THER'RE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO BE ON ATS THAT I PERSONALLY DISAGREE WITH WHY ALSO DON'T THINK I'RE WORTHY OF LIKE A GREAT CONVERSATION MEAS I JUST ONT THING THAT THEY'RE WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND I REALLY DON'T THINK THERE WIRTHIN MY OVERTON WINDOW BUT MY OVERTON WINDOW IS NOT EXESS OVERTON WINDOW DNOR SHOULD IT BE BY THE WAY BECAUSE IF YOU WANT A PLATFORM TO REMAIN A PLATFORM IT HAS TO INCLUDE EVEN PEOPLE YOU DON'T THINK ARE INSIDE THE OVERTON WINDOW IN ANY CASE HERE WAS THAT YOU ON HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH ALEC ONES OVER THE WEEKEN  I ASKO NO A AN N AIT AM YOU KNOW INETE QUESTION I REALY HAVE TOS GET OUTHE WAY AN YOU QUIT ONT BOT THIS A AS THE WHOL SANYHOK THING AND AM AND A YOU DON'T ECAUSE I  AST IS A LIKE OTHERSLY I IF YER IS TA SISI DI DENYING ORTHAT S THERE IS A CHO THAT'S NOT COOL AT AT ALL AM YE AND IS THERE JUST WHAT AGREFU TI DID YOU SAY  N N AND WHAT WHAT IS ONON THAT SINC SITUATION IW I JUST I WOULD LIKE TO ACTY HERE WHAT WHAT TO WHAT DID YOU SAYD ANEN DE A THE INTER TAT EXPLODED IT WAS A TOP STORY FOR OFF IT ON THREE YEARS WITH ALL THE WITH ALL THESE A PROFESSORS IN FORMER SCHOOL SAFETY PEOPLE AND AT ALL O THEM SANG THEY BELIEVE IT WAS A DRILL AND I SEMPLY COVERED THEM COVERING THAT WHAT WAS TIN INIT CART AGAINST ME AND IN BOTH CASES WERE AS CON GUILTY BY JUDGES TALKING NEW YORK THERE'S A JUDGE AN INGIAN TRUP CASE NOT EVENA JURY IS RELL TAKE CASE AND AND THEN YEARS LATER AFTER TRUMP GOT ELECTED AN AFTER I WASTY PLATFORM IT MADE ME BIGGER AND SO SUDDENLY I WOULD WAKE UP THERE WOULD BE SOMETIMES A HUNDRED ARTICLES OR MORE A DAY EVERY MANTRODUC CHANNELS SANG THAT I WAS CURRENTLY SANG NOBODY DIE CURRENTLY SENDING PEOPLE THEIR HOUSES CURRNTLY PEING ON GRAVES COW DO YOVEN KNOW THESE PEOPLE'S NANGS ALWAYS SAID ONE OF THEIR NAMES EVER NOW OW AT IM THAT I BELEVE THER CHILDREN DIED AN AT D RE GET ALL THAT T CAN O SI IMAGINE I WAS NOT Y PLATFORM NO MENTION OOF OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTING IT CADATICAN A FOR FOR LIE SIX SEVEN YEARS THN THEY GO BACK TO MY TIME LINE AN A TREN OS H BIG NEW YORK P AR FARM DEMOCRATIC PARTY THEY GRADGUD UP THEY RUNE CUNDREDS OF ARTICLES SOMETIMES TO DAY BUT A WEEK FOR OVER YEAR SUDDENLY BECOMES A BIK STORY AGAIN O KATE SO OM THAT IS NOT A GOOD EPLANATION BECAUSE IT HAS LITERALLY NOTHING TO DOWITH WHAT HE ORIGINALLY SAID ABOUT SANDIHOOK WHICH IS WHAT HE WANT WAS ASKING HIM ABOUT BY THE WAY THE EXACT QUOTES FROM ALECJONES VOT SANDIHOK AR QUOTE MY GUT IS WETH THE TIMING IND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED A THIS IS STAGE AND YOUKNOW IVE BEEN SAYING LAST YOU MONTHS GET READY FOR THE BIG MASSUTINGS AND THEN MAGICALLY IT HAPPENS FOLKS HO GOT TO GET PRIVATE INVESTIGATERS UP TO SANDYHOOK RIGHT NOWBIC THEM TELLING YOU THIS THIS THINKS THE HIGHEST HEAVEN IT'S AS PHONY IS THE THREE DOLLAR BILL YOU GOT PARENTS LAUGHING HAHAHA AND THEN THEY WALK OVER THE CAMERA AND GOBOOHOOOO AND NOT JUST ONE BUT A BUNCH APPARENTS DOING THIS AND THEN PHOTES OF KIS THAT ARE SO LIVE THEY SAID DIED AN MEAN THAT THEY THINK WERE SO DUNE WHY DID HITTLER BLUP THE RATSTAD TO GET CONTROL WHY WHO GOVERNMENT STAGE THESE THINGS TO GET OUR GUNS WHY CAN'T PEOPLE GET THAT THROUGH THEIR HEADS AGAIN LIKE OUC JONES CONSPIRACY THERUS SAYS A MUCH OF CRAZY CRAP LIKE A LOT THEY THE ATTEMPT A SORT OF MEAN STRI THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS BY THE WAY WITH HAVING A SPEECH POLICE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE PLATFORMS IS THAT IF THE PLATFORMS ARE FAIRLY OPEN AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE OUTSTONES ON THERE I'L GET COMMUNITY NOTED PEOPLE WILL NOTE WHEN HE SAYING SILLY GARBAGE AND THAT'S A GOOD THING I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING INSTEAD WHAN INS OP HAPPENING IS WHEN WHEN YOU CAN FLATE THE OVERTON WINDOWS HEE JACK DORSEY OR THE TWITTERBOARD WITH LEGITIMATE CON VERSATION WHEN THAT OVERTON WINDOW IS THE PLATFORM THEN THE FEELING IS AS THEY SHRINK THAT OVERTO WINDOW RATIONAL PEOPLE END OUT OUTSIDE THEY'RE OVERTO WINDOW AND THEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES ON THE SAMESIDE OF THAT WALL AS ALIC JONES FOR EXAMPLE AND SO THERE'SBEEN THIS CONF LATION TE AMERICAN MINE BETWEEN BAN BY ACTS OR DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY JACK DORSEE AND RATIONAL AND THAT'S NOT CORRECT AND THAT'S SO WEIRD YOU DON'T YOU SAY TWO THINGS AT ONCE ONE ALE JONES OUGHT TO BE ON EX YOU OUGHT TOBE ON FACEBOOKY OUGHT TO BE ON APPLE THE REMOVAL OF HIM FROM THESE SUPPOSEDLY NEUTRAL SERVICES IS RIDICULOUS AND NOT BASE IND ANY HART AND FAST POLICY IF THEY WANTED TO SAY THE HARDEN FAST POLICY IS IF YOU LOSE A BILLION DOLLAR COURT CASE I'M DEFIMATION THEY DON'T GIT TO BE ON THE PLATFORMS FINE AT LEAST THAT'S A STANDARD BUT DON'T HAVENEY STANDARD JUST ARBITRARILY APPLYING A STANDARD ANDTHE PROMISE WHEN YOU ARBITRARILY AP APPLY THAT STANDARD THEN YOU REACTIVE RIGHT TENDS TO SAY OKA YOU ARBITRARILY APPLI THE STANDARD THEREFORE YOUR RATIONAL AND GOOD BUT YOU LAT TUCKER DID WITH ALECJONES THE OTHER NIGHT READ HE HAD HIM ON A SHOW ANDHE SPENT LIKE AN HOUR AND A HALF TRYING TO MAKE ALECJONES NOT ONLY LOOK GOOD BUT LOOK LIKE A PROFIT IT WAS VERY WEIRD THATDUN KNO LIKE TUCKER IS DOING THAT AN THIN TUCKER AGAIN IS MUCH MORE MAN STREAM LEGETIMATE VOICE AND MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THAT SO I'M NOT SORE WHAT GAME HE'S PLAYING THERE BUT AGAIN THAT GAME WHICH IS ALEC JONES IS LIKE A RATIONAL REASON' BLE PERSON THAT IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION AS DOES ALEJONES BELONG AN EX  ELAN MUSK TOTALLY RIGHT TO PUT ALECJONES BACK ON USK BY THE WAYTHN HES YU BROUGT EN IT OUT TO INCLEE PEOPLE I ABSOLUTLY DEPISE AND THINK ARE TERRIBLE AND IF THEY ARE REMOVED IF THEY ARE RETURNED TO EX I THINK THAT THAT WILL BE OU KNO AGAIN A GOOD THING IN THE SENSE THAT EX OUGHT TO BE IN OPEN PLATFORM I'M SAYING THAT EVEN WHILEL I SAY TAT THAT WILL INCLUDE PEOPLE ARE VICIOUSLY AN I'S METIC RACES HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHY REALLY REALLY DON'T LIKE BECAUSE IF THE ARGUMENT IS THAT HE'S ARE PLATFORMS THEN THE PLATFORMS HAVE TO BE PLATFORMS THEY CANNOT IN FACT JUST BE PUBLICATIONS BY ANOTHER NAME BY THE WAY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ALEC JONES TOOK GAT ALEC JONES IS LAWYER SED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN DURING COSTITY BATTLE THAT HIS FOOTAGE COULD NOT BE ENTERED INTO THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE ALECJONE'S PLAYING A PART S HE SAID THAT ALL OF THE CRAZY WHICH WAS BEING USED BY HIS EX WIFE AS A RATION AL FOR CUSTODY THEY SAID ACTIALY HE'S NOT CRAZY HE'S LYING OR  HE'S AN ACTOR THAT'SWHAT HE HUS SO AGAIN ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS IS TRUE A IN JUST ONE SECOND WE'LL GET TO THE LATEST IN THE ISRAL CONFLICT AGAIN THE LACK OF CLARITY FROM THE BIND ADMINISTRATION IS CRATING SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN THE MIDDLE EAST BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THEY DO FIRST I'VE GOT A HOLIDAY GIFT IDEA THAT SURE TO MAKE YOU THE HERO OF THE SEASON NOW WE ALL KNOW THE HOLIDAYS CAN BE LITTLE BAT HECTIC THE SHOPPING THE COOKING

COMMAS THAT CONTINUES ISRAELISTING TREMENDOUS MILITARY SUCCESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING IS AS THEY GO INTO THESE AREAS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE CLEAR OF CIVILIANS THEY'RE ARRESTING EVERYBODY WHO'S A MILITARY AGE MAIL IN THESE AREAS AND THEN OE OF THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING IS THE SAME THING THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DOES BY THE WAY WHEN IT ARRESTS PEOPLE TVERY OFTEN THEY HAVE THEM UNDRESS AND THEY MAKE SURE THATHEY DON'T HAVE CONTRABAND ON THEM IN THIS CASE WEAPONS ON THEM SUICIDE VESS ON THEM AD OFE COURSE THE MEDIA ARE LATCHING ON TO THIS TO THE SAME MEDIA THET HAVE BEEN DOWTING ISRAEL'S WORD ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE WOMEN BEING RAPED AND BRUTALLY MURDERED THAT SAM MEDIAS LIK ALMI GOT A CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE UNDRESSING THESE MEN BEFORE THEY ARREST THEM THAT THIS HIS LITERALLY ONE OF THE THING THAT THEY ARE DOING WHICH IS TOTALLY INSANE COMMOSSES ENGAGING SOM THE WORST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS EVER AND ISRAEL IS A RESTING PEOPLE AN KEEPING IT NOT JUST SHOOTING THEM KEEPING THEM ALIVE WILL RALLYS MANY OF THESE PEOPLE BUT THEY UNDRESS THEM TEMPORARILY TO MAKE SURE THEY N TO BOMBS ON THEM AND THEMEDA LIKE ALL MYT GOD WHAT A HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATION THAT IS LIKE OBU GRAVE REALLY WAS HOT WAT OBA GRIBBWAS WAS JUST MEN UNDRESSED OR WAS IT LIKE SIMULATED SEXTUAL ACTS WAS IT A LEGED TORTURE MEAN WHAT WOULD EXACTLY THIS I IT IT'S SO INSANE BUT AGAIN THIS IS WHAT R MEDIA DO ARE VAUNTED MEDIO MEANWHILE COMMOSS LITERALLY STEALING AID HERE THERE'S ACTUAL FOOTIS A'S BEEN RELEASE BY THE IDEA OF COMMASS STEALING THE SUPPOSED HUMANITARIAN AID THAT IS GOING INTO THE GOSISTRIP THEYRE LITERLLY STEALING FOOD THEY'RE LITERLLY STEALING WATER YOU CAN SEE IT FROM AERIAL SHOTS THESE ARE MEMBERS OF CAS ORE GOING UP TO A HUMANITARIAN AID TRUCK AND THEY ARE JUST REMOVING ALL OF THE RESOURCES AND THEY'RE RELOADING IT INTO THE COMOSTROCS S THEY'RE STEALING THE AID MEANWHILE THE WHITE HOUSE IS STILL SENDING TO MIX SIGNALS SO THE WHITE HOUSE OVER THE COURSE LASS SEVENY TWO HOURS DID VEDO OF YOUUN RESOLUTION CALLING FOR AID IMMEDIATE SEASE FIRE AND WHITE HUSE LIKE GUIS IS THE MENT MDDLE OF A MILITARY OPERATION THAT HAPPENS TO BE CORRECT BUT THE WHITE HOUSE IS STILL DOING THIS RIDICULOUS ROUTINE WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT IF THEY SEND MIXED SIGNALS SOMEHOW THIS IS GOING TO TICK OFF TERRORUS LESS OR SOMETHING SO ANTONY BLINKIN HE HAS TO UPHOLD THE LIE THAT SO MUCH LIBERAL FORM POLICIES BEEN BASED ON FOR THE LEST I DON'T KNOW SINCE SINCE THE UNDRWORLD WERE TO WHICH IS THAT THERE IS A COMMUNITY OF NATIONS THAT EVERY ONE REALLY THE DEFAULT IS THAT EVERY ONE GETS ALONG AND WAR IS AN ABERRATIN AS OPPOSED TO THE WORLD IS A REALLY MEAN AND NASTY PLACE AND SOMETIMES Y HAVE TO GO AN YEFTED KILL THE BAD GUISES SO INSTEAD IT IT'S ALL OF THIS SORT OF WEARD HAPPY TALK COMBINED WITH THE UNDERLYING UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL OF LIBERAL FORM POLICY IS BASED ON A LIE WHICH IS THAT EVERYONE IS FRIENDLY THE UEN IS A WONDERFUL PLACE AND ALL OF THE REST SO ANTONY BLINKING YESTERDAY HE 'S ASKED ABOUT ISRAEL S CONTINUING MILITARY OPERATIONS ISRAEL BY THE WAY HAS KILLED FUER PEOPLE WITH EVERY BOMMING THAN ANY MODERN MILITARY IN HISTRIN AND URBAN AREA THEY'VE DROPPED AT THIS POINT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BOMBS AT THIS POINT THE'RE KILLING ABOUT POINT EIGHT PEOPLE PERBOM DROPPED WHICH YOIS A WAY LOWER RATIO THENS A A ROK AFED GANISTAN OR WHEREVER ELSE YOU'RE TALKING OUT UR BEN COMBAT ANCASES HERE WAS THAT TONY BLINKIN AGAIN THE UNITED STATES POSITION SO FAR HAS BEEN ISRAEL NEEDS TO DEFEET COMMOSS AND THEN WE WANT A LOOK TO THE ARAB WORLD AS THOUGH WE ARE TUGGING ISRAEL'S CHAIN BECAUSE IF WE'D IF WE DON'T ISRABLE JUST GOHOG WILD WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT TRUE THE REALITY IS THAT A COLD AND COLLECTIVE POLICY BY THE WEST OF IF YOU SCREW WITH US YOU FIND OUT WOU'D BE BETTER NOT PASSIONATE NOT OVER WEENING BUT AFF AROUND AND FIND OUT IS AN EXCELLENT FOREIGN POLICY THT 'S THE KIND OF FORM POLICY THAT ANDS WITH WAIT FOR IT DE TORRENTS YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T O MY GOSSHAR WE HAFE TO BE SO CAREFUL ALL MY GO HO DN'T KNO ABOUT US WE MEGHT WE MIGHT I KNOW YOU WE MIGHT U WHAT MADDBY WERE THE BACK LIKE THIS KENNISTO HAS ISTOP HERE'S HE ANTHONY BLINKIN OVERTHE WEEKEN MARTHA WERE FOCUST ON TWO THINGS WERE FOCUSTON WHAUT WHAT IS THEIRE INTENT AND DO THEY HAVIN PLACE HOR THEY ARE THEY TAKING NECESSARY MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIRE ACTING IN ADHERENCE WITHINTERNATIONAL AH YOU MATITRA LAW AND ITERNATIONAL AW BUT THEN ALSO WHAT ARE THE RESULTS AHAND AS I'VE SAID BEFORE AN THERE IS THEARI TOLTS THE INTENT THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN THE INTENT AND THE AND TE RESULTS AND ER THAT'S THE GAP THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE IS CLOTHES LOOK THIS COULD BE OVER TO MORROW THIS COULD BE OVER TO MORROW IF AMOSCOT OUT OF THE WAY OF CIVILIANS INSTEAD OF HIDING BEHIND THEM IF IT PUT DOWN ITS WEAPONS IF IT'S SURRENDERED A SO UM HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT LAST PART BUT  NOTICE HOW HE RESPONSE EVERYTIME THE MET O BUT WE'VE SEEN THE RESULT ON MI GOD PEOPLE ARE YES IT'S CALLED A WAR AND COMMOSS IS OH OVERTLY VIOLATING THE LAWS OF WARBET THE MINUTE THE MARTHORADITS AS THE THING THAN BLINK HAD WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEN GAPISING NAME A WAR WERE YOU DON'T  SERISON WHERE'S THE MATIC WEAPON IF THE JEWS HAD THEIR SPACELAVS OR MAY BE THEY BE USING THAT BUT THEY DON'T CONTRA POPYLOR OPINION THAT MIGHT MY FAVORITE TONY BLINKING CLIP OVER THE WEEK AND NACTUALLY WHATCE HE WAS ASKED WHY THE UAN HAS BEEN SO SLOW IN CONDEMNING COMMOSS RAPISTS WE ALL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS THE UANE IT'S COMPRISED OF HORRIBLE COUNTRIES THAT DON'T CARE ABOUT MASS RAPE AND TELEBRATE THE MASS RAPE OF JEWISH WOMEN PARTICULARLY THAT IS THE REALITY THE UANE IS GARBAGE THE UANE IS A TRASHEE IT SHOULD BE BLOWN UP AN THE EARTH SHOULD BE SALTED BENEATH IT I'S A HORRIBLE PLACE BUT TONY BLINKIN CANCT TO SAY THE OBVIOUS BECAUSE TO SAY THE OBVIOUS WE MEN UNDER MINDING THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER THAT DOESN'T EXIST BY THE WAY THEN ME CLEAR ABOUT HOW FOREIN POLICY HAS HISTORICALLY WORKED OVERTHE COURSE HE LAST SEVERAL CENTURIES THE ONLY THING GUARANTEEING ANY LEVEL OF SOLIDITY IN FOREIGN POLICY DURING THE EIGHTEENTH AN NINETEENTH CENTURIES WAS BRITISH HEGREMANY OVER THE WATERS THAT'S IT AND THEN THAT AGREMANY WAN THT WE GOUT WORLD WARS WONTED TO THEN THE ONLY THING THAT GUARANTEED ANY LEVEL OF WORLD PEACE WAS THE UNITED STATES HAVING HAGEMITY LARGELY OVER THE WATERS AND AS THAT BEGINS TO WANE WE ARE GETTING CHAOS IS NOTION THAT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN THE THING STANDING BETWEEN THE WORLD AND GLOBAL WAR SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE IS THE DUMMEST BOTA GARBAGE I'VE HEARD IN FOREIGN POLICY TALK IN A LONG TIME AND WE HEAR'S ANTHONY BLINK AND TRYIN TO UPHOLLD THE PRESCIOUS THE YOUAN I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER I DON'T KNOW WHY A COUNTRIES YOU DO KNOW LEADERS YOU KNOW INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WERE SO SLOW TO A FOCUS ON THIS TO BRING IT TOE PEOPLE'S ATTENTION I'M GLAD IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED THE ATROCITIES THAT WE SAW ON OCTOBER SEVENTH ARE ALMOST BEYOND HUMAN DESCRIPTION OR BEYOND OUR CAPACITY DIGEST AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THEM BEFORE BUT THE A SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAT A WE SAW ON OCTOBER SEVENTH A IS BEYOND ANYTHING THAT A THAT I'VE SEEN EITHER A SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT AND LOOK I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S A QUESTION THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS THESE COUNTRIES NEEDTO ASK THEMSELVES OH THEY'VE TASKE THEMSELVES A WIF WE SHAME THEM IF WE SHAME THE NEMBLLED WIT GUESS WHAT A POLICY OF SHAMING TERRAS DOES NOT WORK A POLICY OF SHAMING TERROR SUPPORTING MECHIMES DOES NOT WORK EITHER YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS UNENDING HOLD CALCULATED DETERMINATION THAT'S WHAT WORKS IN FORM POLICY PERIOD THAT'S IT SO MEANWHILE WHAT IS THE UNITED STATESWHN WLE EVERY TIME THY SHOW THE SORT OF WAVERING AND MEAS THA WERE NOT GETING PUSHED AROUND AND WHEN I SAY WE AM IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE WEST MORE BROADLY WE ARE GTTING PUSHED AROUND IN THE RED SEA WERE GTTNG PUSHED AROUND BY A BUNCH OF HOOTHY PIRATES WARE ARMED LIKE YOU KNOW NINETEEN EIGHTYES MUSAHADINE AT BEST IF TH UNITED STATES ONE ITOND THOMAS JEFFERSON ENDED THE THE BARBARY PIRATES OCATIN LIKE EIGHTEEN O TOO AND YET HERE WE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY AND WORLD HISTRE ALL WHILE THOSE WHOOTHES MAN WE CAN WE CAN'T TOUCH THE HOOTHIES GO BE REALD CAREFUL WH PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY WHY IS THAT INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING SHOULD BE HARASSED IN TE RED SEA BY A BUNCH OF BARBARIAN MOORONS AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SIT HERE IS THE WEST MEG WHELL YOU KNOW THET THERE ARE THE WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE HOOTHIES WHY HERE IS ANTONY BLINK IN EXPLAINING TE'R BEEN MISTILE ATTACKS ON COMMERCIAL SHIPS IN THE RED SEAS SINS THERE ARE THREATS OF DOZENS OF COUNTRIES WE MIGHT DOZENS OF COUNTRIES I DON'T KNOW DESTROY THE HOOTHIES THEN THERE WERE A SERIES OF MISTL ATTACKS ON COMMERSHOAL SHIPS IN THE RED SEE THIS WEET THAT YOU ESSES CARNEY RUSH TO AID THEM ANDIT UP SHOOTING DOWN SEVERAL DRONES FIRE BY THE ARONIAN BACK TOTIS IN YELAT THE EMINY ARMED FORCES NOW SAYING THEY WILL PROHIBIT THE PASSAGE OF ANY SHIPS TO ISRAEL AND CONSIDER THEM A TARGET WHAT O YOU DO ABOUT THAT WELL THEI'RE NUMBER THINGS A FIRST WHAT WE'VE SEEN COMING FROM THE HOOTHIES A DIRECTED IT SHIPS IN THAT AREA AIS A THREAT NOT JUST TO ISRAEL A NOT JUST TO US BUT TO DOZENS OF COUNTRIES A THAT'RE ENGAGED IN IN SHIPPING THAT DEPEND ON THIS CORRIDOR A FOR A GOODS MOVING ABOUT AT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPLICATED THE INTERESTS DIRECTLY OF WELL OVER A DOZEN A DOZEN COUNTRIES WITH A CRUISE FROM ALL SORTS OF A DIFFERENT PLACES IT SO THAT'S TRUE AND ALSO WHAT IS THE WEST GOING TO DO ABAUTER WOULD BE THE QUESTION MORE WEAKNESS YHOU SHOW TO YOU KNOW EIGH TINY BADLY ARMED LITTLE NOTHING OF A TERRORS SCREW LIKE TH HOOTHIES AS THE UNITED STATES E MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN ROALD HISTORY OF COURSE THAT THAT LEADS TO SIGNALS WHAT SIGNALS DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GIVING EXACTLY DETERINCS IS THE FOREIGN POLICY THAT WORKS AND DETERINS IS BASICLLY JUST A MILDLY MORSOPHISTICATE AVERSION OF FK AROUND AND FIND OUT THAT'S ALL BUT HERE'S THE THING IF YOU CAN DO THAT YOU HAV TO MAKE THEM FIND OUT THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THAT HAPPIN NOW THE REAL REASON WHY THE BITE ADMINISTRATION IS SO CONCERNED ABOUT ALL THAT I'S BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY'RE DEEPLY AFRAID THAT IF THEY'RE MEANS THE HOOTHIES THAT SOMEHOW THEY GON TO LOSE MUSLIN VOTES IN MICHIGAN FIRST OF ALL IF YOU'RE MEAN TO A TERROR SCRUP N YOU LOSE MUSLIN VOTES MAYBE THAT'S JUST THE PRICE OF DOING BUSINESS HONEST THE GOD IF YOU'RE IF YOU IS A PARTY CAN'T STAND UP TO MUSLIN TERRACE BECAUSEYOU'RE AFRAID THAT MUSLIMS AND MICHINGAN ARE KOIN O VOTFERY IF YOU STAND UP TO TERRACE METHERE COMES ITHAT IS KIND OF AN AMAZING CONDEMNATION OF YOUR PARTY IS IT NOT WE'RE TOLD CONSTANTLY BY THE MEDIA THAT THE THE RIGHT HAS TO DESSOCIATE FROM WHITE SU PREMISESS WHICH THEY SHOULD BY THE WAY OF COURSE OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY'RE CERTAIN VOTES NOT WORTH HAVING HAV AOUT PEOPLE WHO LIKE COME OSS IT SEEMS TO ME IF YOU LIKE COMMOSS MAYBE TAT'S

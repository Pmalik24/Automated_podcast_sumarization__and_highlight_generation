JORDAN CONCEIVED OF HER EARLY CHILDHOOD SENNER IN HER HOME TOWN BABIES DEKIN TOR GARDEN SHE COULD PICTURE IT IN HER MIND BUT SHE SAYS IT WASN'T UNTIL JENAIA SHOWED UP A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND SHE GOT TO SEE HER IN A REAL CLASS ROOM THOUGHT'S WHEN MISS JORDAN FELT LIKE THIS SISCAN A WORK SENAIA TOLD ME FOR HER WHEN SHE WACKED INTO MISS DOURDAN SENNER TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD SHE WAS NERVOUS IN A WAY SHE HAD NOT BEEN BEFORE BECAUSE SHE FELT LIKE THIS IS IT THIS IS THE JOB I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT ANADORN AMESS IT OUP AND SHE DID LOVE THE JOB BUT THEN WENTY MORTY I IN COBIG WHA  I WEEL O FOR A LITTLE WHILE A LOT OF BAR A YE DO WARN'T COMING GA E I I WULD NERVIT LIKE ARE WE GOU TA MARK TE CORL YOUNOTL IN MIGHTY NOTGOR ULD BE YE KNOW GETTING PAN FOR A LITTLE WHILE I DER NOT THERE WE GEV THA LOT OF ON FERTANY THERE WAS THE TIME THE OWNER MISS JORDAN ASKED EVERYONE TO HOLD OFF ON GETTING PAID AND THEIR PEACHECKS CAME IN LATE AND THE TIME CENAIA WAS PRETTY SURE HER PACHEK CAME FROM MISS JORDAN'S PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNT CENAIA BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE WAIT IS THERRE NO CUSHION IN THIS BUSINESS SHE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS BEFORE BUT ONCE SHE STARTED TO SHE SERVED TO HAVE SOME DOUBTS WHEN A FRIENE POSTED ABOUT A JOB AT THE LOCAL HARDWOR STORE CENAIA APPLIED THEN SHE HAD TO TELL MISS JORDAN THOG SHE CAME TO MY OFFICE O SHUT THE DOOR AN IDE THAT WAS BAT WOULD SHUT THE DO THIS IS MISS JORDAN AGAIN NE O SHE DID NOT A CRY I HE I I WAS OFFER A JOB THAT WAS THE FIRSTH HIVE EVER CRIED WITH THO ONE GAVE THEIR NOTED I  BLOK IT WE STURE CRYING O YE IT THE LIKE TET I    CRI I CRI I CAN'T A I BE IF I CAN'T FAR TO WORK HERE THIS IS OBIOUS BUT DESERVE SAYING ANYWAY SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE WE CALL ESSENSIAL WORKERS DO NOT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY THERE OVERWHELMINGLY LOW WAGE WORKERS ABOUT HALF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO MAKE LESS THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR WORK AN FIELDS WE NOW CALL ESSENSIAL SO YOU CAN BE THE VERY BEST AT RUNNING THE GRILL OR CLEANING THE OFFICE BUILDING OR MANAGING RUDE CUSTOMERS AT THE RESTAURANT YOU CAN BE THE STAR TEACHER TEACH HER NUMBER FOUR SHONIA AND S STILL ONLY MAKE AN AVERAGE OF ELEVEN OR TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND NO HELP CARE MISS JORDAN BARELY MAKES ENOUGH FROM TUITION TO COVER HER EXPENSES BUT SHE'S RELUCTANT TO RASE RATS ON FAMILIES BECAUSE SHE KNOWS MANY PARENTS CANT AFOR TO PAY AND SHE KNOWS FROM EXPERIENCE THAT IF SHE GOES TO HIGH FAMILIES AREGOINGTO PULL THEIR KIDS ALTOGETHER WHEN CHENAIA TALKED TO MISS JORDAN AND WHEN SHE TALKED TO ME ABOUT LEAVING HER JOB SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SEE THE WORD QUIT SHE TOLD MISS JORDAN I HAVE TO GET DONE I KNEW THAT SHE WAS YOU TO TRY LIKE YOU KNOWOW EVERYTHING TO SHO PAYME MORE I BUT I KNEW THAT EVERYTHING SHE WAS YOU KNOW TRYIN TO DO POSSIBLY WAS IT GOIN TO WORK OUT IN THE END JUST BE CI SHE COULD SHE REALLY COULN'T E FOR TO DO THAT AN AND THEND YOU KNEW THAT YI AND I KNEW THI N I AND I UNDERSTOD MISS JORDAN DID DO ALL THOSE THINGS SHE PLEADED WILL FIAR SOMETHING OUT JUST GIVE ME MORE TIME AND SHE TRID TO TECHNIQUE THAT I THINK IS MAYBE ONLY APPLICABLE IN A SMALL TOWN WHEN CHENAA SAID WHERE SHE WAS GOING MISS JORDAN SHOOK HER HEAD I WOULD I AT OUR  HATED E TOLD HER AD YE I WOULD LIKE I LOVE YOU AND AND I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY BUT YOU TO HATE ID AND I KNOW THE BOT I THAT OLDER OF IT IN I IT HE WON'T LOVE YOU TO WAY I LOF YOU  PAY THAT LI I DON'T I KNOW AND I I ALLFE THOUGHT LIKE OF A HT TAT T TED THAT SO CENA LAFT AND MISS JORDAN WAITED FOR HER TO RETURN I IT IT IT IT T I IN THE EARLY CHILD CAREWORLD THERE WERE TWO SOMEWHAT DISTINCT PHASES OF THE PANDEMIC THERE WIS THE BEGINNING IN WHICH E CHILD CARESENERS LOST MONEY EVEN AS THEIR WORK BECAME LABELLED ESSENSIAL AND THEN THERE'S THIS MOMENT NOW WHERE WHAT WAS ALREADY A CHRONIC PROBLEM OF TEACH HER TURN OVER HAS BECOME SO MUCH WORSE BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY CAN'T CONPIT PLACES LIKE ALMARK WHOM DEPO FADAC FIRSERY STOR ACHAINS LIKE PROGER CAPT MAKING MONEY OVER THE PANDAMIC AMAZON MADE RECORD PROFITS CHILD CARE CENTERS DID NOT SO TEACHERS ARE LEVING FOR JOBS AT AMAZON OR DUNKAN DONATS OR GROCERY STORES THAT CAN PAY THEM MORE AND SOMETIMES GIVE THEM HEALTH BENEFITS A WOMAN IN OHIO WHO OWNS A CHILD CARESEN ARE TOLD ME EVEN THE AMUSEMENT PARTS CAN PAY BETTER THAN WE CAN WRITE NOW O  MEN FO  AFO WHEN MISS JORDAN LOST GENAIA TEACH HER NUMBER FOUR OF TWENTY THREE SHE ALLOWED A THOUGHT THAT HAS BEEN SITTING UNCOMFORTABLY TO THE FOREFRONT EVER SINCE WHAT IF I CAN NEVER KEEP SOME ONE LIKE CENAIA BUT IF NO ONE EVER BELIEVES THIS IS VALUABLE I FEEL LIKE UNCONFULLY TRYING TO PROVE MY FELT THAT WHAT I'M DOING IT IT IMPORTANT I HAVE A COLLEGE TOGREE EDUCATION PEOPLE DON'T NO PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO LIKE HOW COULD IT CAUGHT THE LOT ARE'T COU I JUT LIKE COLORING AND EATIN GOLT THEY SHALL DAY WITH THEM E NO WHNO I MAKE A LATING PLANT FOR EVERYTHINGL COTHROOM IN FA UP TO THE FOOLAGE PROGRAM THERE TO MANY REGULATION THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW A THEYRES A TGADUEL THERES A MEAL PLANT THERE TRAINING THAT MY FHAT HAVE TO TO WE RUN THAT LIKE A CHOOL TONLY DIFFERENT IS THAT THERE'S NO PUBLIC FUNDAY FRAT WHY IS IT THAT ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAPPEN TO BE SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY HOW COULD A JOB THAT IS SO VALUABLE BE PAID SO LITTL THERE'S SOME STANDARD EXPLANATIONS YOU WILL HERE MANY ESSENTIAL JOBS DO NOT REQUIRE EXTRA CREDENTIALS OR A LOT OF EDUCATION THERE'S A LOT OF AVAILABLE LABOR TO DO THESE JOBS IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE LOW PAID BECAUSE THEY ARE QUOLED LOW SKILLED JOBS BUT ALSO ONE THING THAT UNITES THIS BROAD CATEGORY OF LOW PAID ESSENTIAL JOBS AND ALMOST EVERYONE YOU'VE HEARD FROM IN THIS JOW IS NOT THE KIND OF WORK THEYRE DOING BUT WHO IS DOING IT BLACK PEOPLE THE TENO PEOPLE EMIGRANTS WOMEN AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO COVER MORE THAN ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES MANTY FIVE PER CENT OF CHILD CARE WORKERS ARE WOMEN LIKE WOMEN LIKE GENIA MISS JORDAN AND MANY WOMEN OF COLOR ALMOST HALF OF CHILD CARE WORKERS AR PEOPLE OF COLOR THE FIELD IS MUCH MORE RECIALY AND LINGUISSICALLY DIVERSE THAN KEEP THROUGH TWELVE TEACHERS AND THE PEOPLE IN IT MAKE MUCH LESS MONEY THE PANDEMIC GAVE CHILD CARE AND A FISSIAL STAMP OF ESSENTIALNESS IN THIS SINGULAR MOMENT IN HISTORY WHEN IT IS MORE CLEAR THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN AND MAY EVER BE AGAIN THAT SCHOOLS AND CHILD CARE ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF LITERALLY EVERYTHING BUT MISS TORN'S WORK AND THE PEOPLE DOING THAT WORK MAY NEVER BE VALUED ENOUGH FOR HER TO SECURE MORE FUNDING OR FOR HER TO GET CENAIA BACK ANMISS TORNINGENAIA LIVE IN A TOWN OF EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE SO WHEN CENIA LAUGH SHE WENT ALL THE WAY TO A JOB ACROSS THE STREET SHE PARKS IN THE SAME SPOT SHE DID WHEN SHE WORKED AT MISS JORDANS MISSTORDN TOLD ME I SEE HER ALL THE TIME SHE CAME BY LIKE EVERY DAY AFTERWORK PERFIR WEAKE OVER THERE AND HEEL LIKE LONE NOT THE SAME THET THING NOT THE FAME HE LIKE I DIDN'T THINK OU THATI HAVE TO WORK FATURDAY THAT HAVE TO WORK EVERY FATURDAY IL FELOR AND I THAT WE ARE YEAR OLD BOT NEVER MAY DE WORK A THATURDAY AI JORIT EYET THOUGH WE KINDILATE WE PAV EACH OTHER ABOUT THAT THA A AN THA LIKE HE'L C YO COME TO HAVE LOTCH WITH ME A COUPLE PIF THIR HER LUNCH BREAK THET THE DAYLS WORKING OT A PROJECT AD I AM THEY PAINT THET LENT OVER THERE HE RECON BOUT O PAINT COUT ARE HAMAC BY PAERVAK AND WE ALL THEY WATKED HARE LIKE MAKE PA LIKE I CANT PIT THE PAT YOUR DOING LIKE YOU ARE FE TALIT TIT IT THEYLL GIFTED AND NOT NOT THAT MATO MAKIN PAT IT EPORTANT BUT LIKE AT PIT OR DOING THEY HEAR THEY GIT THAT YOU CAN'T EAT IT CULD KILL ME TO WATCHER GE AV THIY THAT IT NOT WHAT AR GIFTED A ER PACKET ONE THING ECONOMISTS WILL SAY ABOUT ECONOMIC MOMENTS LIKE THIS WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE QUITTING THEIR JOBS THEY'LL SAY T'S A GOOD THING HIGH QUITS NUMBERS EQUALS OPTIMISM PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL THEY'RE GOING FOR THAT DREAM JOB PEOPLE FEEL SECURE ENOUGH TO LOOK AROUND A LITTLE FOR WHAT THEY REALLY WANTOD DO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A MARKET THAT DOES NOT WORK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TALENTED PERSON WHOSE DRAWN TO A JOB THAT IS ESSENTIAL THICH HE'S NOT DOING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PAY ENOUGH  ACK FORTH THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITTING WHO ARE HAPPY ABOUT IT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAD CONFUSED BY WHAT THEY WANT OF COURSE THERE'STHE WHOLE RANGE ONE THING I FOUND INTERESTING IS THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE THERE WAS OFTEN ONE MOMENT THAT SET THINGS IN MOTION FOR THEM A WHILE BACK SOME SYMBOL OF SOMETHING JUST BEING OFF IN THEIR JOB AND THEN IT'S LIKE THESE SYMBOLS JUST SAT NEXT TO THEM FOR MONTHS AND OF HAUNTING THEM UNTIL THEY COULD NOT DEAL ANY MORE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES DOING SOMETHING THEY NEVER PLAN TO DO SOMETIMES THAT WAS QUITTING BUT THERE WERE SOME OTHER REPROACHES AS WELL SO FOR OUR LAST STORY I WHENT I TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THOSE

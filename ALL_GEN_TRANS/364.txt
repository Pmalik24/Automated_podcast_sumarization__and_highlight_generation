WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LADPODCAST N TE CUST SCIENCE A SCIENCE BASE TOOL FOR LIFE  I MANJER HUBERMAN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY GUEST TO DAY IS DOCTOR ADAM GRANT ADAM GRANT IS A PROFESSOR OF ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY AT THE WHARTON SCHOOL AT UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA HE IS AUTHORED FIVE BEST SELLING BOOKS AND MOST RECENTLY HAS AUTHORED A NEW BOOK ENTITLED HIDDEN POTENTIAL HE RECEIVED HIS BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND HIS DOCTRATE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN TO DAY WE DISCUSS PURE VIEWED STUDIES AND TOOLS BASED ON THE DATA FROM THOSE STUDIES THAT CAN ENABLE PEOPLE TO MEET THEIR GOALS AND OVERCOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES INCLUDING HOW TO OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION AS WELL AS HOW TO SEE AROUND OR THROUGH BLIND SPOTS AS WELL AS HOW TO OVERCOME STICKING POINTS IN MOTIVATION AND CREATIVITY WE ALSO DISCUSS THE RESEARCH ON AND PRACTICAL TOOLS RELATED TO THE UNDERPINNINGS OF PERFORMANCE IN ANY ENDEAVOR INCLUDING HOW TO INCREASE ONE'S CONFIDENCE AND HOW TO HAVE A PERSISTENT GROWTH MIND SET BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU THAT DOCTOR ADAM GRANT HAS AN ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR DEPTH AND BREADTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND THAT KNOWLEDGE IS BOTH PRACTICAL IT IS BASED ON PUREVIEWED RESEARCH AND HE CONVEYS THOSE TOOLS WITH THE UTMOST CLARITY AND GENEROSITY INDEED BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE MORE THAN A DOZEN NEW TOOLS NEVER DISCUSSED BEFORE ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST THAT YOU CAN APPLY IN YOUR ACADEMIC ENDEAVORS IN ATHLETIC ENDEAVORS IN CREATIVE ENDEAVORS IN FACT IN ANY AREA OF LIFE BEFORE HE BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZED AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZEROCOSS TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY I'VE SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS POD CAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP REALLY IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IS CORRECT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL IN STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN PROGRAM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IN THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF YOUR NIGHT AN HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES LIKE TRACKING THE AMOUNT OF RAPID I MOVEMENT AND SLOW WAVE SLEEP THAT YOU GET THINGS ARE ESSENTIALE TO REALLY DILING IN THE PERFECT NIGHT SLEEP FOR YOU I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON AN EIGHTESLEE MATTRESS COVER FOR WELL OVER TWO YEARS NOW AND IT HAS GREATLY IMPROVED MY SLEEP BY FALL ASLEEP FAR MORE QUICKLY I WAKE UP FAR LESS OFTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND I WAKE UP FEELING FAR MORE REFRESHED THAN I EVER DID PRIOR TO USING IN ETE SLEEP MATTRESS COVER IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN NOW THROUGH NOVEMBER THIRTIETH AS A SPECIAL HOLIDAY DISCOUNT EIGHT SLEEP IS OFFERING FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OFF THEIR BUNDLES WITH A POD COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS AND THE U S A CANADA THE U K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE U AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO A S BY LEVELS LEVELS IS A PROGRAME THAT LETS YOU SEE HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AFFECT YOUR HEALTH BY GIVING YOU REAL TIME FEED BACK ON YOUR DIET USING A CONTINUOUS GLUCOS'S MONITOR ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH IS YOUR BLOOD SUGAR OR BLOOD GLUCOS REGULATION WITH LEVELS YOU CAN SEE HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND FOOD COMBINATIONS EXERCISE AND SLEEP PATTERNS IMPACT YOUR BLOOD GLUCOS LEVELS IT'S VERY EASY TO USE YOU JUST PUT THEM MONER ON THE BACK YOUR ARM AND THEN YOU TAKE YOUR PHONE AND YOU SCAN IT OVER THAT MONER NOW AND AGAIN AND IT DOWNLOADS THE DATA ABOUT YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS IN THE PRECEDING HOURS USING LEVELS HAS ALLOWED ME TO LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT WHAT WORKS BEST FOR ME IN TERMS OF NUTRITION EXERCISE WORK SCHEDULES AND SLEEP SO F YOUR INTERESTED I LEARNING MORE ABOUT LEVELS AND TRYIN G A CONTINUOUS GLUKOS MONITOR YOU CAN GO TO LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMAN LEVELS HAS LAUNCH A NEW CEGIUM CENSOR THAT IS SMALLER AND HAS EVEN BETTER TRACKING THAN THE PREVIOUS FIRSION RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ALSO OFFERING AN ADDITIONAL TWO FREE MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP AGAIN THAT'S LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMEN TO TRY THE NEW CENSOR AND TWO FREE MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY WAKING UP WAKING UP IS A MEDITATION AP THAN INCLUDES HUNDREDS OF MEDITATION PROGRAMMS MINDFULNESS TRAININGS YOGANED RASESSIONS AND ANESTY AR NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST PROTOCALLS I START USING THE WAKING UP AP A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN DOING REGULAR MEDITATION SINCE MY TEENS AND I STAR DOING YOGANEDRA ABOUT A DECADE AGO MY DAD MENTION TO ME THAT HE HAD FOUND AN AP TUR NOT TO BE THE WAKING UP AP WHICH COULD TEACH YOU MEDITATIONS OF DIFFERENT DURATIONS AND THAT HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDITATIONS TO PLACE THE BRAIN AD BODY INTO DIFFERENT STATES AND THAT HE LIKED IT VERY MUCH SO I GAVE THE WAKING UP APATRY AND I TOO FOUND IT TO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL BECAUSE SOMETIMES I ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO MEDITATE OTHER TIMES I'VE LONGER TO MEDITATE AND INDEED I LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN EXPLORE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDITATION TO BRING ABOUT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS BUT ALSO TO PLACE MY BRAIN AND BODY INTO LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF STATES DEPENDING ON WHICH MEDITATION I DO I ALSO LOVE THAT THE WAKING UP AP HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGANEDRA SESSIONS THOSE HE DON'T KNOW YOGANEDRA IS A PROCESS OF LYING VERY STILL BUT KEEPING AN ACTIVE MIND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN MOST MEDITATIONS AND THERE'S EXCELLENT SCIENTIFIC DATA TO SHOW THAT YOGANEDRA AND SOMETHING SIMILAR TO IT CALLED NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST OR ANES TOYAR CAN GREATLY RESTORE LEVELS OF COGNIVE AND PHYSICAL ENERGY EVEN WHICH  A SHORT TEN MINUTES SESSION IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THE WAKING UP AP YOU CAN GO TO WAKING UP DOC COM SLASH HUBERMAN AND ACS ESS A FREE THIRTY DAY TRIAL AGAIN THAT'S WAKING UP DOC COM SLASH HUBERMAN TO ACTS ESS A FREE THIRTY DAY TRIAL AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR ADAM GRANT ADAM WELCOME EXCITEDLY H VERY SI TO HAVE YOU HERE A YOUR CAREER BOTH PUBLIC FACING AND ACADEMIC CAREER COVERED AN ENORMOUS RANGE OF TOPIC SO WE HAVE A LOT TO COVER LICRETAKIN A AND ANY TIME A TWO PROFESSOR SIT DOWN OR EVEN ONE PROFESSOR AM SAYS WE HAVE A LOT TO COVER I THINK EVERYONE LISTENING BRACES THEMSELVES OH NO BUT THESE TOPICS A I ASSURE EVERYONE ARE OF THE UTMOST INTEREST AND YOU COVER THEM IN SUCH BOTH FABULOUS DETAIL AND YOU MAKE IT VERY CLEAR SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR IT TO THIS I LIKE TO START OFF BY TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I AM OBSESSED BY AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE OBSEST WITH AND STRUGGLE WITH AND I KNOW YOU ALSO HAVE A RECENT PUBLICATION ON THIS TOPIC WHICH IS PRECASTINATION I AM A BIT OF A PRECASTINATOR BUT A DIFFERENT WAY OF STATING THAT IS THAT I LOVE DEADLINES I LEARNED IN COLLEGE THAT I LOVE LOVE LOVE DEADLINES BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO HARNESS MY FOCUSS IN MY ATTENTION I LIKE JUST ENOUGH I GUESS YOU CALL IT ANXIETY OR AUTONOMIC AROUSAL FOR THE OUN OW NERROW SCIENCE OR PHYSIOLOGY ORNANTED FOLKS FOR ME JUST BRINGS ABOUT A TOTAL ELIMINATION OF ALL THE DISTRACTORS AND IT SEEMS TO BOTH SLOW AND ACCELERATE MY PECEPTION OF TIME AND IT SEEMS TO BRING OUT MY BEST TO HAVE DEADLINES BUT I WOULD PREFER TO NOT HAVE TO PRECASTINATE IN ORDER TO SELF IMPOSE DEDLINES I PREFER THAT OTHER PEOPLE IMPOSE THOSE DEDLINES IN FACT SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT PREASTINATION WHY DO SOME PEOPLE COMPLETE THINGS WHILE IN ADVANCE WHY DO OTHER PEOPLE PRECASTINATE IS IT THAT THEYR SEEKING DEADLINES AS I BELIEVE I AM AND INTERESTINGLY AN SORT OF ALLUDING TO THIS RECENT PAPER YOURS WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRECASTINATION AND CREATIVITY I FEEL I PRECIEN TO STEAL WITH ALL THAT LATER BUT ENOUGH NGOOD ONE I BY THE AY THERE'S EXTRACREDIT FOR SCIENCE IONS ON HERE SO MIE EARLY DON ONE OF THE BEST ARTICLES ON PROCRASTINATION EVER WRITTEN WAS TITLED AT LAST MY ARTICLE ON PROCRASCINATI INTASTI LA YE JUST MADE ME SMILE I'M SO I THINK THAT THE THE BASIC QUESTION I THINK TO START WITH IS WHY DO WE PROCRASTINATE AND I I THOUGHT I WAS IMUN ACTUALLY WHEN I CAME INTO THIS TOPING I WAS THE THE PERSON WHO ANNOYED MY COLLEGE ROMATES BY FINISHING MY THESIS A COUPLE MONTHS EARLY I FOUND OUT THERE WAS A TERM FOR ME I'M A PRECRASTINATOR ISO THE YOU NOW THE FOCUS IN THE PRESSURE THAT YOU GET FROM A DEADLINE I GET THAT THE MOMENT THE PROJECT STARTS I AND SOMETIMES MONTHS OR YEARS IN ADVANCE AND SO I WAS REALLY PROUD OF FINISHING EVERYTHING EARLY AND THEN I DISCOVERED THERE ARE THINGS THAT I PROCRASTINTE ON TOO WHICH WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTING ARE YOU WILL INTO SHARE WHAT SOME OF THOSE I AM I SO I AM I PROCRSTINATE ON ANYTHING THAT'S ADMITISTRATIVE SO I'M RIGHT THOUGH WITH YOU IT GAT TIME OF MY CALENDAR IT COULD TAKE ME WEEKS TO RESPOND YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION ABOUT SOCIAL SCIENCE I WILL BE BACK TO YOU IN A MINUTE I'M I PROCRASTINATE ON GRATING TAKES ME FOR EVER I I BASICALLY PUT OFF A WHOLE MONCH OF TASK THAAT TE THOUGHT HAD NOTHING IN COMMON IT TURNS OUT THAT I PROCRASINATE WENT ON BOARD BORDOM IS I I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY MY MOST HATED EMOTION AND SO I WILL DO ANYTHING TO AVOID A BORING TASK AND I THINK THIS GOES TO WHY PEOPLE PRCRASTINATE WHICH IS A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S LAZINESS OR YOU'RE NOT DISCIPLINED ENOUGH BUT ACTUALLY THAT THE RESEARCH ON THESS IS REALLY CLEAR THAT YOU'RE NOT AVOIDING WORK WHEN YOU PROCRASCINATE IN FACT A LOT OF OUR PROCRASTINATION IS IS FOCUS ON DOING THINGS THAT INVOLVE A LOT OF ENERGY YOU'VE SEEN PEOPLE PROBABLY CLEAN THEIR ENTIRE HOUSES WHEN THE'RE PUTTING OFF A TASK I'M SO IT'S IS NOT THAT YOU'R BEING LAZY IT'S THAT YOU'RE AVOIDING NEGATIVE EMOTIONS THAT A TASK STARTS UP SO FOR ME IT SPORTOM FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S FEAR ANXIETY I DON'T NOW IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF II HAVE AN EXTREME CASE OF IMPOSTORS INTRUMENT THIS ROL I'M THE THE CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF ME IS TOO DAUNTING I'M FOR SOME PEOPLE IS CONFUSION I HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET AND SO I CAN'T WORK ON THIS AUSE I I FEEL LIKE COME STOCK I'M SO WHAT'S I GESS THE BE QUESTION FOR YOU THAT ANDRESS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE EMOTION TO CAUSES YEUE TO CRASSINATE YOU KNOW IT'S HARGE FOR ME TO IDENTIFY THE STICK HERE I THINK OF IT MOREIS THE CARROT THAT COMES WITH DEAD LINE AND AGAIN I DON'T CONCERN MYSELF A PRASTINATOR PER SAY I JUST REALLY LOVE DEADLINES IN PRECRASTINATION IS A TERRIFIC WAY TO SIMULATE THE DEAD LINE AH SO FOR ME O YOU WAITS FOR YOU DELAY STARTING OR FINISHING A TASK AN ORDER TO HAVE A A SENSE OF TIME PRESSURE THAT'S RIGHT IT BUILDS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INTERNAL ROUSALN ME TO KNOW O KE I'VE GOT SEVENTY TWO HOURS TO COMPLETE SOMETHING AND IT'S NOW GAME TIME I LIKE THE GAMETIME BEFORE THE GAME TIME BEFORE A PODCAST I'LL PUT IN ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW SEVERAL DAYS TO WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS IN PREPARATION SO IT IT'S REALLY ELASTIC DEPENDING ON THE TOPIC BUT WHEN IT CAME TO EXAMS IN SCHOOL OR IF IT COMES TO WRITING DEAD LINES A I CONSIDER THE THE SHIPPING OF THE PRODUCT OF THE PRESENTATION OF THE LIVE EVENT THAT I HAPPEN TO BE DOING AS THE SECOND GAME THE ORE EVENT THE FIRST EVENT IS THE PRESSURE AND THE EXCITEMENT OF GETTING INTO THE GROOVE OF DOING FOCUST WORK BECAUSE FOR ME THAT'S SUCH A DRUG I MEAN IT FEELS LIKE ALL HAVING ALL THE SYSTEMS OF MY BRAIN AND BODY ORIENTED TOWARDS ONE SPECIFIC THING IS JUST SHEER BLISS FROM ME SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT A CHRONIC PROCRASSINATOR THANK YOU AND  NEVER THAT'S NEVER BEEN OF THE WAY IF VIEWED MYSELF BUT NOW I I'LL TAKE THE IT'S A STRATEGY FOR YOU IT IS A STRATEGY THAT'S RIGHT AND I EDENT YOU KNOW I WAS FAIRLY WAYWARD YOUTH BARELY FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL ET CETERA SO BY TIME I GOT SERIOUS ABOUT SCHOO WHICH WAS MY SECOND YEAR OF UNIVERSITY WHEN DEAD LINES WERE PRESENTED LIKE THERE'S AN EXAM THERE'S A MID TERM EXAM ON A GIVEN DATE THAT WAS EXCITING TO ME THAT WAS EXCITINGS LIKE OK THAT'S THE BIG THING THAT'S MY OPPORTUNITY TO TO PROVE MYSELF TO MYSELF CAUSE I WAS REALLY COMING FROM BEHIND AND THEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO OR I SHOULD SAY THAT THE FEELING OF DROPPING INTO THAT GROVE LIKE THIS IS THE EXCITING PART IS THE PREPARATION LIKEWISE WITH PODCASTING FOR OUR SOLO PODCASS I LOVE THE RESEARCH AS MUCH AS I LOVE PRESENTING THE MATERIAL MAYBE MAYRYMORE MAYBE MORE RIGHT LIKEWISE FOR UNIVERSITY LECTURES OR FOR TRAVELLING AND GIVING SEMINARS AS A TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT RIGT ITSA IT'S WO PREPARATION IS WHERE YOU REALIZE IT'S ALMOST LIKE I I THINK OF IT IS SOMEBODY LIKE  LIKE A MINER IN A MINE AND JUST FINDING A GEM AND OF COURSE THERE OUGHT THEN THEY'RE ALL THE THOUGHTS OF WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THAT LADER AND YOU'E IN TO SHOW PEOPLE IT U HAS A CERTAIN VALUE TO THE WORLD ET CETERA BUT BUT IT'S THA THE SEARCHING IN FINDING THOSE GEMS THAT IS LIKE EVEN AS I TALK ABOUT I LIKE FEEL LIKE MY BSIGCAN FLOAT OUT OF THE CHAIRI'VE THE SAME EXPERIENCE TIT'S THE IT'S THE THE SRV THE UNLEAST CURIOSITY AND TAN THE RUSH OF DISCOVERY AND BY THE TIME YOUARE TEACHING IT OURE EXPLAINING IT BUT I READY NOTHICE HAVE NOT LEARNING IT TOTHING ANY MORE AND YES I'M EXCITED TO SHARE IT AND I HOPE IT'S HELPFUL TO OTHER PEOPLE SO YEI THINK IS AS YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOUR PROCESS ESS LIKE I DON'T EVEN THNK WHAT YOU DO QUALIFIES IS POR FASCINATION TECHNICALLY IL SEE'S GETTING BETTER BETTER SIF THINK ABOUT HOW PREFASCINATION IS IS DEFINED IT'S IT'S DELAYING DESPITE AN EXPECTED COST AND YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S A COST YOU ACTUALLY SEE A BENEFIT THAT'S RIGHT AND I'VE TRIED STARNATNO FOR FASCINATION THAT'S ITS TLAY YOU 'VE TRIED STARTINGTHINGS EARLIER AND AND I SHOULD SAY THAT MY PROCESS OFTEN BEGINS MUCH EARLIER THAN THE PHYSICAL PROCESS LIKE IF I WAS BEING OBSERVED IN AN EXPERIMENT THE OK YOU KNOW ANDREWS FINALLY SITTING DOWN TO WRITE THIS BOOK CHAPTER OR'S YOU KNOW FINALLY SITTING DOWN TO RE SEARCH SOME PAPERS FOR AN EPISODE BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME I MAY MUCH TO THE DISMAY OF PEOPLE IN MY LIFE YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M CONSTANTLY THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS AVE MAING  T WALKING TO TAKE OUT THE RECYCLE I'LL HAVE IDEAS AND THEN I'LL WRITE THEM DOWN I CONSTANTLY WRITING THINGS DOWN VOICE MEMOIS INTO MY PHONE I'VE A METHOD OF CAPTURE WHERE I BASY TRYING TO GRAB EVERYTHING AND THEN FILLTER OUT WHAT'S USEFUL DO YOU HAVE A PROCESS LIKE THAT FOR FOR GLEANING IDEAS A LITTLE THAT I DO NOW SO I'M WHEN WHEN GEATION AND I STARTED THIS RESEARCH ON PRCRASCINATION SHE HAD SHE HAD COME TO ME SHAS VERY CREAT OF DOCTORAL STIDEN AND SHE SAID I HAVE MY BEST IDEAS WHEN I'M PRECRASCINATING AND IT WAS IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERESTING ENOUGH IDEA THAT IT WAS WORTH EXPLORING AND I SAID SHOW ME GET LET'S GET SOME DATE OT LET SEEHING OF PRECANTEST THIS AND SHE ENTED UP BY GATHERING DATA IN A CAREAN COMPANY WHERE SHE SURVEYED PEOPLE ON HOW OFTEN THEY PRECRASCINATE AND THEN GOT THEIR SUPERVISORS TO RATE THEIR CREATIVITY AND SURE ENOUGH FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO PRECRASCINATE SOMETIMES WERE RATED IS MORE CREATIVE THAN PEOPLE WHO RARELY DO LIKE ME THE PRECRASCINATORS AND I REMEMBER ASKING HER WHAT ABOUT THE CHRONIC PRECRASCINATORS AND S I DON'T KNOW THEY NEVER FILLED OUT MY SURVEY YES I RECALL FROM THAT PAPER THERE'S INVERTED YOU SHAPE FUNCTION WITH PRECRASTINATION ON THE VERTICAL OXES AND AND OM IAND CREATIVITY ON THE HORIZONTAL AXIS LET IT FLET SOR O KI SO UM EXPLAIN TO ME THEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRECRASTINATION CREATIVE YES SO BASICALLY THA THE PIQUE OF CREATIVITY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF PRECRASCINATIA OKA GOT IT AND YETHERES THAT THERE'S AN UPSIDE DOWN YOU CURVE THERE AND SO THEN I THOUGH THIS WAS FASCINATING SO THAND WE GO INTO THE LAB TO SAY CAN WE REPLICATE THIS CAN WE CONTROL IT AN AN EXPERIMENT AND THE HARDEST PART OF THAT WAS HOW DO YOU RANON ME ASSIGN PEOPLE TO PRECRASCINATE TO MY KNOWLEDGE NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AND WE EVENTUALLY FIGURED OUT THAT WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE A A BUNCH OF CATASTIDO AND HEN TEMPT THEM WITH HIGHLY ENTERTAINING YOU TO VIDIAS THAT WERE STPLACED ON DHEIR SCREEN AND WE PUT DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF YOU TWO VIDIOS THERE SO THAN ITHERE'S ONLY ONE YOU'RE NOT TEMPTED TO PROCRASTINATE MUCH IF THERE ARE FOUR YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET SUCKED IN TO A LITTLE BIT OF YOU TOO SPIRAL IF THEY'RE EIGHT AYOU MIGHT BE PUTTING OFF THE TASK THAT'S MUCH LESS EXCITING THAN THEN OU OT WATCHING JIMMY KIMBLLS MEAN TWEATS FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS WAS DONE IN A THURHLY NATURALISTIC CONVIRNENT THEPIBLER PEOPLE ARE IN AA COMPUTER THER THEY'RE ASKED TO YOU KNOW TO SOLVE SOME CREATE PROBLEMS THAT LOOK PRETTY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU MIGHT DO IN YOUR JOB AND THEN WERE GIN A SCORE YOUR CREATIVITY LATER AND I IT TURNED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ATTEMPTED TO PROCRASINATE MODERATELY I'M ENDED UP GENERATING THE MOST CREATIVE IDEAS SO WHY IS THAT I'M THE RE COUPLE TINGS THAT HAPPEN AND YOU HVE TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES OF THE CURVE SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PRECRASTINATORS AND ALSO WHAT HAPPENS TO THE THE EXTREME PROCRASTINATORS I'M AND IN BOTH CASES WOULD HAPPENS IS I YOU WENT UP WITH A LITTLE BIT ATTUNNELVISION SO I'M WHEN I DIVE RIGHT INTO A TASK I'M STUCK WITH MY FIRST IDEAS AND I DON'T WAIT LONG ENOUGH TO INCUBATE AND GET MY BEST IDEAS I'M I'M LESS LIKELY TO REFRAME THE PROBLEM I'M LESS LIKELY TO ACCESS REMOTE KNOWLEDGE CAUSE I'M JUST I'M JUST DIVING RITING AND MEANWHILE THE CRODIC PROCRASTINATORS I'M END UP IN THE SAME BOAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET STARTED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AND SO THEY HAVE TO RUSH AHEAD WITH THE EASIEST IDEATO IMPLEMENT AS UPPOSED TO REALLY DEVELOPING THE MOST NOVEL IDEA AND MEANWHILE THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE WHO YO STARTING TO FEEL THAT PRESSURE OF WHY I I SPUN MY WHEELS FOR TEN MINUTES WATCHING A BUNCH OF YOU TO VIDIOS AM RUNNING OUT OF TIME FOR THIS TASK THEY STILL HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO WORK ON THE IDEAS THAT WERE ACTIVE IN THE BACK OF THEIR MINDS AND AND THAT GIVES THEM  A SHOT AT MORE NOVEL IDEAS SO I'VE TRIED TO ADOPT THIS  ANSWER QUESTION I'VE TRIED TO ADOPT THIS IS MY PROCESS NOW TO SAY I WILL STILL DIVE INTO A PROJECT AHEAD OF SCHEDUL BUT I WILL NOT COMMIT TO AN IDEA UNTIL I'VE LET IT INCUBATE FOR A FEW WEEKS AND I'M WORKING ON OTHER THINGS WHEREAS AN EARLIER VERSION OF ME WHEN I'D SIT DOWN TO WITE A BOOK I'M THIS IS I HAD THE BOOK IDEA I WOULD START RIG ING A DAY ONE NOW I HAVE THE IDEA I FILE IT AWAY AND I GIVE MYSELF AT LEAST A MONTH BEFORE I BEGAN DRAFTING I AND I THINK IT FEELS LESS PRODUCTIVE BUT IT'S FAR MORE CREATIVE WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT SOME OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBED BEING A UNCONSCIOUS WAY OBSEEDING THE MIND AND THE UNCONSCIOUS WITH AN IDEA SO FOR INSTANCE A LETIC A A SCHOOL ACADEMICSONARIO WHERE A STUDENTS GET AN ASSIGNMENT AND THE ASSIGNMENT IS CONTAINED WITHIN A FOLDER AND IT JUST AS ASSIGNMENT OK AND IT'S A DO IN A PARTICULAR DATE AND IT SAS DO ON THAT PARTICULAR DATE AND THE'RE GIVEN THE FOLDER BUT THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF WHAT THE ASSIGNMENT IS YOU CAN IMAGINE ONE CATEGORY PRECASTINATOR THAT WILL TAKE THAT THING AND PUT IT DOWN AND AVOID LOOKING AT IT ENTIRELY VERSEIS ANOTHER CATEGORY PRECASTINER THAT WILL FLIP FLIP IT OPEN AND TAKE A LOOK AT OKE THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ESSAY ON YOU KNOW AM I DON'T KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT A ECONOMIC THEORY IN THE LATE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS CLOSE IT AND THEN PRECASTINATE THERE IS AN IDEA WHICH I FRANKLY I SUBSCRIBED TO A LITTLE BIT A BECAUSE WE RECENTLY DID THIS SERIES ON MENTAL HEALTH NOT MENTALONESS BUT MENTAL HEALTH WITH DOCTOR PALCANTI WHERE HE TALKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE UNCONSCIOUS AND HOW THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS ALWAYS WORKING WITH IDEAS THINGS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PERFORMANCE THESE SORTS OF THINGS EVEN IF WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THEM AM WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE CREATIVITY THAT SEEDED BY SLIGHT PRECASTINATION BEING RELATED TO ACTUALLY KNOWING WHAT YOUR PRECASTIDANING ON SPECIFICALLY I I THINK IT TURNS OUT TO BE I DON'TWAT TO SAY ESSENTIAL BUT CRITICAL SO ONE OF THINGS WE FOUND IS IN ORDER FOR MODERATE PREASTINATION TO FUAL CREATIVITY YOU HAVE TO BE INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED BY THE THING O'RE PRECASCINATING ON INTERESTIN AND SO WHAT WOULD HAPPENS IS IF YET IF YOU IF YOU'RE BORND FOR EXAMPLE BY THE TOPIC YOU'RE KNOCKIN A OPEN THE FOLDER YOU'RE NOCKIN A START THINKING ABOUT IT AT ALL IT'S KNOCKIN TO BEGAN YU' NOT CAN DO ANY SUBCONSCIOUS PRASCESSING YOU'RE NOCKIN TO HAVE ANY UNEX FECTED CONNECTIONS I'M BETWEEN THIS TOPIC AND SOMETHING ELSE YOU'VE LEARNED  LEARNED A BOUTER OR BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE PROBLEM THAN WHEN YOU PUT IT OFF YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO STILL KEEP IT ACTIVE IN THE BACK YOUR MIND IMTHAT'S WHEN WHEN YOU BEGIN TO TO SEE YOUNOW I IIMAGINE YOU CAN EXPLAIN THE BIOLOGY OF THIS I'M  IIMAGINE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S I'M THERE'S PROBABLY I'M THERE PROBABLY MORE NARL NETWORKS 'M THAT ARE CONNECTING I'M YOU PROBABLY GET YOU GET ACCESS TO IDEAS THAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN I'M SORT OF SEPARATE NOTES AND SO I THINK THAT OU YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TOPIC IS  YOU DON'T WANTED TO SEE THE BLANK ASSIGNMENT BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO FIND A REASON THAT THIS IS EXCITING TO YOU I'M OTHERWISGE ERE CAN AVOID IT AS UPPOSED TO LETTING IT PROCLATE THAT BRINGS US TO THE TOPIC OF INTRINSIC MOTIVATION IM AND I'D LIKE TO LINK THAT UP WITH THE TOPIC OF PERFORMANCE SO WHEN I WAS IN UNIVERSITY THERE WERE MANY TOPICS THAT I WAS EXCITED TO LEARN ABOUT SOME MORE THAN OTHERS OF COURSE  BUT OCCASIONALLY I'D BE IN A CLASS OR A GETTAN ASSIGNMENT FRANKLY HAD MINIMAL INTERESTED NEVER ZERO BUT MENTIMAL INTEREST AN AS A WAY OF DEALING WITH THAT I EMBARKED ON A PROCESS OF LITERALLY LYING TO MYSELF AND JUST TELLING MYSELF BOQUET I'M SUPERINTERESTED IN READING THIS AND I'M GOTIN O FORCED MYSELF TO BE INTERESTED IN READING IT AND LO AND BEHOLD I WOULD START FALLING IN LOVE WITH CERTAIN THINGS MAY BE IT WAS IT WAS EVEN THE IM YOU KNOW THE ARRIVAL OF A WORD THAT I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE AND THEN I WOULD GO LOOK ATOP AN I KNEW I WAS STUDYING FOR THE GEORY AT THAT TIME SO I D FILE THAT AWAY I STILL HAVE MY KNOW BOOKS OF ALL THE VOCABULARY WORDS THAT I LEARNED IN THE COURSE OF MY UNIVERSITY COURSES THAT FRANKLY MADE THE VERBAL PORTION OF THE GEORY LOOKPRETTY EASY THEO WHICH IF YOU EVER TRYING STUDY FOR THAT AT THE END IT'S PRETTY TOUGH TO COMMIT ALL THOSE NEW WORDS TO ATO MEMORY AND CONTEXT SO I COULD FIND LITTLE HOOKS AND AND THROUGH THOSE HOOKS I COULD CONRACHET MY WAY INTO A LARGER INTR REST AND THEN LO MEHOLD I'M REALLY INTERESTING GREEK MYTHOLOGY YOU KNOWR THAT ACTUALLY LIKE THAT ONE AT FIRST BUT UM AND ENOUVH TO TRICK MYSELF BUT NO MAY WE COULD SPENDAL A BIT OF TIME TILKE ABOUT WHAT IS TRUE INTRINSIC MOTIVATION IS IT ALWAYS REFLECIVE A CAN WE MAKE OURSELVES INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED ABOUT US GIVEN TOPIC ORS SENARIO OR GROUP OF PEOPLE A AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW INTRINSIC MOTIVATION LINKS TO PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THERE'S A RICH LITERATURE ON THIS AS I RECALL AND I REMEMBER YOU THE STAMFORD STUDY OF REWARDING KITS FOR THINGS THAT RALITY THAT'S VERY MOTRAT TO DO IF WE COULD TOUCH ON THATALO BIT N REMIND PEOPLE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT BUT I'M FASCINING BY THIS TOPIC BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SO MUCH OF LIFE IS ABOUT DOING THINGS THAT INITIALLY WE DON'T FEEL THAT EXCITED TO DO AND YET SUCCEEDING IN LIFE YOU KNOW UNTIL YOU CAN AFFORD TO AFF LOAD YOUR A ADMINISTRATIVE WORK TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHICH HOPEFULLY Y NOW YOU HAVE A YOUAVE DONE RI I THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO BEING A FUNCTIONAL HUMAN BEING FRANKLY NI JUST SUCCESSFUL IN AER QUOTES BUT FUNCTIONAL WE GOT TO DO STUFF THAT WE DON'T ENJOY DOING YES SO I THINK WEWE CAN TIKE ABOUT A COUPLE DFFERENT WAYS TO NERTRENSIONS COMMOTIVATION WE CAN THINK OFOUT HOW THE TASKITSELF IS DESIGN WE CAN THINK ABOUT REWARD SYSTEMS AND THEN WE CAN THINK ABOUT ALSO THE THINGS WE SAY TO OURSELVES AND OTHERS WHICH I HOPE R NOT LIES RATHER A PERSUASIVE ATTEMPTS I LET'S T E LUST TART ON THAT WHEN ACTUALLY I I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THAT GOOD AT DELIVER ITSELF DECESTION WELL WELL I LIKE TO THINK IT WAS ONLY AROUND A PARTICULAR SET OF A GOAL MOTIVATED PURSUITS A BUT AT THAT TIME FOR ME ALSO SURVIVAL AS I MENTION I DIDN'T DO WELL IN HIGH SCHOOL I REALLY WANT TO PERFORM WELL IN UNIVERSITY BUT I KNEW THAT WORKING JUST FOR THE GRADE WASN'T GOING TO CARRY ME IT WAS IT FELT CATABOLIC UM AND I O KNOW MAYBE I AT THAT AGE I WAS STILL IN THE WINDOW OF HEIGHTENE NEROPLASTICITY WE KNOW IT NEVER CLOSES BUT AM BUT I THINK I ALSO FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PROCESS OF LEARNING HOW TO DO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED YE SO I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE THE BEST METHOD OF SELF PERSUASION IS ACTUALLY TO CONVINCE SOMEBODY ELSE I SOMETHING OF ALLIED ARRINSON'S CLASSICALRY SEARCH OCOGNITIVE TO CEENT WHERE HE WOULD HE WOULD ASK YOU TO GO AND TELL SOMEBODY ELSE A TASK YOU HATED IS REALLY INTERESTING AND IF YHE PAID YOU A LOT TO DO IT YOU STILL HATED THE TASK BECAUSE YOU HAD A JUSTIFICATION I GOT TWENTY BUCKS TO OUO TO KIND OF FIV A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS TASK IM YOU AT THE TASK IS BAD BUT I DID IT FOR THE FOR THE PAYMENT WHEN HE PAID YOU ONE DOLLAR TO GO AND TELL SOMEBODY THAT YOU LOVED A TASK THAT YOU DIDN'T YOU ENDED UP LIKING IT MORE WHY AND MAYBE I SHOULDN' BE SURPRISE BUT MAYB YOU SHOULD TELL ME WHY I SHOULD BE SBECAUSE I HOPE PEOPLE GOT WHAT YOU JUST SAID VERY CLEARLY IF THEY DIDN'T IF YOU DON'T LIKE DOING SOMETHING GOING IN REPORTING TO SOMEBODY ELSE HOW GREAT THAT THING IS SO LYING ABOUT IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE  IS ONE WAY TO INCREASE THE DOU REA TO WHICH YOU LIKEOR ENJOY THAT BEHAVIOUR OR TOPIC AND IF YOURE PAID TWENTY DOLLARS TO GO LIE TO SOMEBODY IN THE POSITIVE DIRECTION SO AGAINST YOUR TRUE BELIEVE IT'S LESS EFFECTIVE IN SHIFTING YOUR YOUR UNDERLYING AFFECT ABOUT THAT THING YOUR EMOTIONS THEN IF YOURE PAID LESS GRET I EXACTLY NOW I THINK OBVIOUSLY IN THE EXPERIMENT LYING WAS O AN EASY WAY TO TO SHOW THE EFFECT BUT IN REAL LIFE I THINK THE WAY THAT YOU WONT TO APPLY THIS IS TO SAY I I'VE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TASK THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME AND THEN IN THE PROCESS OF EXPLAINING IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE I'M GOING TO CONVINCE MYSELF BECAUSE I'M HEARING THE ARGUMENT FROM SOMEBODY IROTY LIK CAN TRUST ILSO CHOSEN I HOWN HTHE REASONS THAT I FIND COMPELLING IS SUPPOSED TO HEARING SOMEBODY ELSE'S REASONS AND SO I THNK THIS THIS GOES TO THE POINT THAT YOU WERE MAKING WHICH IS IF IF YOU'RE TRYING O TO FIND A HOOK TO MAKE A TOPIC ENTREATING I YOU'VE GOT A FIGURE OUT OQUET WHAT IS IT THAT WOULD M AKE THIS FASCINATING TO ME AND IN A LOT CASEIS WHAT YO'RE LOKING FOR AS A CURIOSITY GAP II THINK SOCHALL CIENTISTS LIKE TO TALK ABOUT CURIOSITY IS AN ITCH DID YOU HAVE TO SCRATCH SO THERE'E SOMTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW AND YOU DON'T KNOW IT YET SO I WOULD SAY I I TELL MY STUDENTS OFTEN TAKE YOURE LEAST FAVORITE CLASS AND FIND A MYSTERY OR A PUZZLE SOMETHING THAT YOU YOU JUST DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO IACTLY 'VE TALKED WITH OUR KIDS ABOUT THIS I WHAT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO KING TUT DO YOU KNOW CAN YOUGET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT AND ALL OF A SUDDENLY I WONDER N YOU DO GOGLET AND THEN I NEED TO SEE IF WICAPEDIA HAS CREDIBLE INFORMATION ON THIS AND THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT THAT THE MORE INTRIGUING IT BECOMES I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS OF OF FINDING INTRINSIC MOT IVATION I SEE SO INHERENT IN YOUR ANSWERS THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WIRED INTO OUR NORL CIRCUITS AND THEREFORE PSYCHOLOGY THAT CURIOSITY AS A VERB THE ACT OF BEING CURIOUS AND SEEKING INFORMATION WHERE WELL AND I SHOULD SAY I DEFINED CURIOSITY IN A HOPEFULLY YOU'LL DISAGREE WITH ME OR AGREE EITHER WAY DOESN'T MATTERS LONGS WE CAN GET BUT DEEP RUNDERSHAND I DEFINE CURIOSITY AS IT DESIRE TO FINE SOMETHING OUT WHERE YOU ARE NOT ATTACHED TO A PARTICULAR OUTCOME YES THAT RIGHT II'VE BEEN PSYCHOLOGISCYPICALLY TO FIND AS JUST WANTING TO KNOW AND THAT MEANS THEY'R DIVEN BY THE QUESTION NOT A PARTICULAR ANSWER WHICH IS EXACTLY WHA YOU'RE DRIVING AT O KIT GREAT SO AND I THINK IT AS DOROTHY PARKER THAT SAID UM THE CURE FOR BORDOM IS CURIOSITY THERE'S NO CURE FOR CURIOSITY AS THERE THERE SHOULDN'T BE A CARE FOR CURIOSITY SO  AND BY THE WAY FOLKS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT NORL CIRCUITS SUBSERVED CURIOSITY IN THE BRAINIS ROUT IT'S A GOT TO BE A DISTRIBUTED NATWORK THERE'S NO BRAIN AREA FOR CURIOSITY BUT IT'S GOT TO BE LINKED UP WITH THE REWARD SYSTEMS OF DOPAMEN ET CETERA IN SOME WAY BECAUSE WHEN ONE DISCOVERS SOMETHING NEW THAT SATISFIES SOME CURIOSITY THAT'S CLEARLY THERE'S A THERE'S A INTERNAL REWARD THERE O CAT LEMME BACK UP SO IF YOUR CHILD OR AN ADULT IS DREADING WORKING EXPLORING A TOPIC OR GOING ABOUT IN ASSIGNMENT OF ANY KIND  YOU'LL GIVE THEM A QUESTION THAT THEY THEN NEED TO RESOLVE WHAT IF THE THE ASSIGNMENT IS LIKE RAKE THE LEAVES OFF THE FRONT LAWN DO YOU A DO YOU SAY YOU KNOW AM COUNT THE LEAVES OR I MEAN T HOW HOW DOES ONE GET A PAST THE SORT OF UM PROCRASTINATION AND A GENERATE SOME INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR THINGS THAT ONE DREADS WHERE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE'RE GOING TO DISCOVER SOME KNOWLEDGE THAT'S EXCEEDINGLY USEFUL FOR FOR FUTURE YOU ALWAYS START WITH WITH KE WHAT'S E WHAT'S THE FIRST EXPERIMENT I CAN RUN FIND THE MOST INTERESTING LOOKING LEAF FOR YOUR FAVORITE LAF AND THAN THAT THAT LASTS FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND OK GET NOW W TILL THE LOTO LEAVES THARE I I THINK NOL TASK CAN BE MADE INTRISICALLY MOTIVATING TO EVERYONE AND SO WHEN WHEN INTRISIC MTIVATION IS DIFFICULT TO FIND WHAT YOU WANT A SUBSTITUTE WITH IS I'M IS A SENSE OF PURPOSE I'M MAY BE A BETTER WAY TO SAY THAT IS I'M WHEN THE PROCESS IS NOT INTERESTING TO YOU I'M YOU NED A FIND A METING FUL OUTCOME SO THERE'S AT THERE'S SOME RESEARCH AN I'M 'M THE BORING BUT A IMPORTANT EFFECT WHERE KIDS WHO HAVE A PURPOS FOR LEARNING I'M THIS GOES THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT JUST INTERESTING TO ME BUT I'M IN A BIABLE TA USE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO I'M TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE ONE DAY I'M THEY THEY'REMORE PERSISTENT AND THEIR STUDYING THEY END OF GETTING BETTER GRADES AND SO I THINK YOUKNOW INTRESICMOTIVATION IS OFTEN DRIVEN BY  CURIOSITY ABOUT THE HOW I'M A SENSE OF PURPOS COMES FROM REALLY THINKING HARD ABOUT THE WHY WHY DOES THIS MATTER AND SO I'D SAY WITH A YOU NAVETHERE MAKING LEAVES LET'S TRY TO CONNECK THAT TASK TO SOMETHING THAT ILL THAT YOU CARE ABOUT I'M ARE YOU GOING TO I'M BEEN A PLEASANTLY SURPRISE YOUR PARENTS WHEN THEY GET HOME I'M ARE YOU GOING TO I'M YOU KNO HAVE A PLACE TO PLACE SACKER THAT YOU DIDN'T BEFORE I'M AND I THINK THEN THAT YOU KNOW THE PROCESS OF OF GETTING TO THAT I GUSS WH I SAY IS IF YOU'RE TIND A MOTIVE IT YOURSELF I'M IT'S A LITTL BIT HARDER THAN IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MOTIVATE SOMEBOY ELSE ON THIS IF I WAS OING TO MOTV ATE SOMEBODY ELSE I WOULD TAKE A A PAGE OUT OF THE MOTIV ATIONAL INTERVIEWING PLAYBOOK WHERE I WOULD SAY ON'T I ANT ECTITO THIS PLACE AT TER A SECOND SO YOU'RE NTERATE A PILE LEAVES IT'S THE TWO HOUR TASK ZER TIS HAND HOW EXCITED ARE YOU ABOUT THAT THREE THREE REALLY I'M SURPRISED I I THOUGHTYOU'R U SAY ZER OR ONE WHY ISN'T NOT LOWER I LIKE ANY SORT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO MOVE IN I JUST LIKE MOVEIN MY BODY THERE RY GOT OT CA SO YOU JUST IDENTIFIED A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF PURPOSE FOR THAT ACTIVITY AND I I DON'T HAVE A I DONT HAVE AVESTED INTEREST IN CONVINCING YOU TO DO THIS TASK I AM GENUINELY CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WOULD MOTIV ATE YOU TO WANT TO DO IT AND AS YOU START TO ARTICULATE IT BE SELF PERSUASION KICKSIN WELL THEN AMY MONSTAR USING ME SI THESE APPROACHES I'LL DRIET AT YOUR OWN RISK AS WE ALL KNOW QUALITY NUTRITION INFLUENCES OF COURSE OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR COGNAVE FUNCTIONING OUR MEMORY OUR ABILITY TO LEARN NEW THINGS AND TO FOCUS AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF HIGH QUALITY NUTRITION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ENOUGH VIDEMENS AND MINERALS FROM HIGH QUALITY UNPROCESSED OR MINIMELY PROCESS SOURCES AS WELL AS ENOUGH PROBIOTICS AND PREBOICS AND FIBRE TO SUPPORT THASIALLY ALL THE CELLAR FUNCTIONS IN OUR BODY INCLUDING THE GUP MICROBIOM NOW I LIKE MOST EVERYBODY TRY TO GET OPTIMAL NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS I DEALLY MOSTLY FROM MINIMALY PROCESSED OR NON PROCESS FOODS HOWEVER ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE FACE IS GETTING ENOUGH SERVINGS OF HIGH QUALITY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY AS WELL AS FIBER AND PROBIODICS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY THOSE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S WHY WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE LONG BEFORE I EVER HAD A PODCAST I STARTED DRINKING A G ONE AND SO I'M DELIGHTED THE A G ONE IS SPONSORING THE HUBERMEN LA PODCASK THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL DRINK A G ONE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES ALL OF MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT PROVIDES INSURANCE THAT I GET THE PROPER AMOUNTS OF THOSE VITAMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBER TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY  G ONE YOU CAN GO TO DRINK  G ONE DOKCALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THE'RE GIVING AWAY FIVE FREE TRAVEL PAKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK  G ONE DOCCLM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THAT SPECIAL OFFER I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT EXTRINSIC MOTIVATION SO IF WE GROW UP BEING INCENTIVIZED BY EXTRINSIC THINGS YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET YOUR ALLOWANCE IF YOU BLANK UM YOU CAN SPEND THE MONEY THAT YOU MAKE AND YOU KNOW ON YOUR PAPER OUT DOING THE THINGS YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS THERE ANY VALUE IN THOSE KINDS OF LEARNING BASEDINSENTIVES  FORT KIDS AND FOR ADULTS BECAUSE AND THAT'S THE REAL WORLD AS WELL I I KNOW PLENTY OF PEOPLE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ONLY WORK FOR A PACECK AND THE'RE PRETTY O K BECAUSE THEY LIKE SPENDING THEIR PACHECU YUHOBLY MORE THAN I YOU'M NOT INTRINSICALLY ATTACHED TO MONEY I MAN I CERTAINLY HAVE NEEDS IN IN LIFE BUT BUT I DON'T ENJOY SPENDING MONEY FOR THE SAKE OF SPENDING IT OR FOR GAINING MORE POSSESSIONS BUT I KNOW PEOPLE THAT DO AND I CERTAINLY DON'T JUDGE M ARE THEY SOMEHOW EXISTING IN IT UM IN THE DIMINISHED LANDSCAPE OF HAPPINESS OR OR BECAUSE THEY SEEM PRETTY HAPPY TO ME BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE ALSO WORKED OUT THIS RELATIONSHIP THEY DO CERTAIN THINGS TO GET THE EXTRINSIC REWARDS AND THEY REALLY ENJOY WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THOSE ESTRINSIC REWARDS THERE'S SO THERE'S A HUGE BODY OF EVIDENCE ON WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF AT EXTRINSIC REWARDS ON MOTIVATION OF PERFORMANCE AND I THINK THER LATEST CONCLUSIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE LATEST MAT ANALYSIES SO YOU KNOW HUGE STUDY OF STUDY IS TRYING TO CUMULATE WHAT'S THE AVERAGE EFFECT OF ADDING A FINANCIAL INSEND IVE TO A TASK THAT WASN'T INSETEVICE BEFORE OR TO A JOB WHERE YOU KNOW YOU WARE PAID SALARY NOW EING TO GIVE YOU INSET OF COMPENSATION I'M THERE IS A BOOST SO IN GENERAL IM PEOPLE ARE ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE WHEN THEY'RE INSENTIVICE FOR THEIR OUTPUT BUT I THESE INSENTIVES ARE BETTER FOR I FOR MOTIVATING QUANTITY THAN QUALITY SO YOU SEE PEOPLE GET MORE DONE BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY MORE CAREFUL OR MORE THOROUGH O LESS CAREFUL UNLESS THEYR NO I'M ACTUALLY THA THEY'RE STILL POSTIVE EFFECTS ON AVERAGE THEY'RE JUST WEAKER I' AND OF COURSE YOU COAN THEN START TO SAY WHELL OW TO I INCENTIVEAS YOU KNOW BEING FAST AN CAREFUL I'M BUT I THINK WERE WHERE WE DO HAVE TO BE REALLY CAUTIOUS IS I'M THERE'S AN UNDERMINING EFFECT OF EXTRINSIC REWARDS ON INTRINSIC MOTIVATION AND YOU ARE YOU ARE ALLUDING TO THIS EARLIER STATING BACK TO THE EARLY SEVENTIES WHERE WE KNOW THAT IF WE TAKE AN INTERESTING TASK AND THEN WE PAY YOU FOR IT YOU MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT FOR THE OUTCOME AND YOU LOSE INTERESTS IN THE TASKS OF THE THE CLASSIC DEMONSTRATION MARK LAPERAN COLLEAGUESIS KIDS PLAYING TVE DEOR GAMES AND THEY'RE  THEY'RE PLAYING THEM BECAUSE THEI'RE FUN AND THAN YOU START TO ADD IN AN INSENTIVE AND THEN WHEN THE HANSENTIVE TAKEN AWAY THEY DON'T WANT A PLANNY MORE BECAUSE THE MEANING OF THE TASK IS CHANGED AND NOW I'M DOING IT CAUS I ON TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT A SUPPOSE TO I LEFT THE PROCESS I THINK THAT THAT I'M THAT PHENOMENON I'M DOES NOT HAVE TO EXIST SO WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE AT WORK I'M IF MANAGERS AS LONG AS THEY GIVE PEOPLE AUTONOMY I' THEY DON'T PRESENT THE REWARDS IN A CONTROLLING WAY I'M SO INSTEAD OF SAYING YOU KNOW ANDREW IN ORDER TO EARN THIS YOU NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING WORK IIF THEY SAY HEY LUKY I'D REALLY LOVE IT IF YOU KNOW IF YOU WOULD DELIVER THE FOLLOWING 'M IN AN ORDER TO MAKE THAT WORTH YOUR WHILE I'M OFFERING THIS INSCENTIVE PEOPLE REACT VERY DIFFERENTLY WHEN THEY HAVE A SENSE OF CHOICE AN CONTROL I'M SO I THINK THAT THAT'S I GESS THE STARTING POINT IN THE PRESENCE OF AUTONOMY I DON'T I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MAJOR DOWNSIDE OF OF EXTRINSIC REWARDS I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT I'M YET I GUESS THAT YOU'RE NOT OVER JUSTIFYING THE TASK IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE NOT I YOU'RE NOT SWAMPING PEOPLE'S INTRINSIC REASON F R DOING IT BUT YOURE ADDING A REASON TO TRY IT SO ACTUALLY I'M IF WE IF WE GO TO A DIFFERENT DOMAIN FOR A SECOND SO I'M THOU GET KIDS WO DON'T WONTO EAT THEIR VEGETABLES EXTERRENSIC CANSENTIVES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE TO GET KIDS TO TRY VEGETABLES FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT THEN THE HOPE IS THAT THEY DISCOVER A VEGETABLEOR TO YO THAT THEY DON'T MIND AND TAND THEY FIND REASONS TO KEEP DOING IT I'M AND I THINK THAT THAT'S HOW I WANT A LOT OF REWARDS TO WORK I DON'T THINK THAT REWARDS SHOULD BE CARRETS THAT WE DANGLE TO TRY TO CONTROL PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR I THINK THEY SHOULD BE SYMBOLS OF HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE IN VALUE A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR AD IF YOU FRAME THEM THAT WAY IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO SAY YE YOU KNOW IT I'M THAT THAT REWARD IS SOMETHING THAT I REALLY WANT BUT I'M I'M NOT ONLY DOING THE TASK FOR THAT REWARD YO THAT THAT YOU BASELY ANSWER THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK WHICH IS AN YOU RISK OF SOUNDING NEW AGEE BUT WE ARE SITTING IN CALIFORNIA IM I COULD IMAGINE THAT WHEN ONE IS FOCUSSED ON THE EXTRINSIC REWARDS SO PHYSICAL TASK OR COGNIVE TASK FOR AN EXTRINSIC REWARD IF I'M FOCUSSING ON THE EXTRINSIC REWARD I'M ALSO OUR QUOTES AGAIN NOT PRESENT RIT I'M I'M THINKING ABOUT THE OUTCOME I'M NOT THINKING OUT PROCESS AND I THINK THERE'S YOU PERHAPS YOU CAN FLUSH OUT SOME OF WHAT THIS IS EXACTLY BUT I THINK THERE'S AFAIRLY EXTENSIVE I'M DATA TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT WHEN WE ARE PHYSICALLY IMENTALLY PRESENT TO THE TASK THAT WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM BETTER AND PRESUME WE ARE ER IM INTRINSIC LIKING OF THAT TASK OR PERFORMING THAT TASK INCREASES AS WELL AS THAT TRUE YE I THINK SO I THINK SO IF WE WON'T TO BREAK TOME THE MECHANISMS FOR WHY IN TRINSIC MOTIVATION IS USEFUL FOR FOR PERFORMANCE I'M ONE YOU TOUCH ON EARLIER IT'S FOCUS OF ATTENTION IM YOU'RE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO FIND FLOW WHEN YOUR IN TRINSICALLY MOTIV ATED YOU GET INTO THAT STATE OF DEEP ABSORPTION WHERE I TIME MELTS AWAY SO YOU MENTION YOUAVE SORT OF EITHER SPEEDING UP OR SLOWING DOWN YOUR YOUR SENSE OF TIME YOU FORGET WHERE YOU ARE SOMETIMES YOU EVEBEN LOOSE TRACK OF YOUR AGAIN TY AND YOU'RE JUST YOURE JUST MURGERS INTO THE TASK AND SO THAT THAT THAT CONCENTRATION IS HELPFUL THERE'S ALSO AA GREATER PER SISTENCE EFFECT THAT WHEN YOU ENJOY WHT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GIVE UP IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO THINK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING THE TASK AND COME UP WITH GREAT IDEAS AND SO IM AN I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A WORKING HARTER THERE'S A WORKING LONGER THERE'S A WORKING SMARTER AND THERE'S ALSO ATHINKING MORE CLEARLY EFFECT THIS IS A A BRIEF BUT RELATED TANGIENT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE FOUND INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT IN RECENT YEARS IS THAT AM IN A MOST OF MY LIFE REALLY SINCE I WAS A SMALL KIT I WAS FORGING FOR THINGS AND THEN NDI USED TO GIVE LECTURES ON MONDAY AND CLASS IF THEY LET ME UNTIL THEY EVENTUALLY STOPP ME ABOUT THE STUFF I WAS READING ABOUT ALL WE CAN SO GONE EARLY STARTNI N THE PROFESSORIAL AM FRONT BUT NOW IF I'M READING SOMETHING AND I DISCOVER I WHAT I THINK IT S A REALLY VALUABLE PIECE OF INFORMATION OR A TOOLER OF PROTOCAL WHILE THIS IS REALLY COOL THESE FINDINGS ARE OH SO COOL THERE'S A PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT NOW I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CAST THAT OUT TO THE WORLD THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA WE ALL DO THIS COULD BE AN OUTSIDE YOUR INSOCIAMEDIA A FROM TIME TO TIME I DON UT YOURE ALL OVER MY  I YOU AND AND I BOTH DO OUR OWN SOCIAL MEDIA BY WAYS WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK O ONE CAN ALWAYS DETECTIVE IF SOME ONE ELSE IS HANDLINGS ON SOCIAL MEDA SO YES I'M ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND AND I LOVE THAT I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH AM SEND OUT IDEAS AN INFORMATION AND ALSO RECEIVED FEE BACK I REALLY LOVE THE COMMENT SECTION AM AND ALWAYS ENCOURAGED COMMENTI I LEARNED FROM IT A FRANKLY LOVE IS THATOR A WORD I LEARNED FROM IT YOU KNOW AND AND YOU AND I WERE WEENED IN THE ACADEMIC CULTURE WHERE FRANKLY THAT THE KIND OF HAZING THAT THAT ONE RECEIVES AN ACADEMIC CULTURE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE KIND OF HAZING THAT ONE RECEIVES ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT AM LETS YOU SAY THAT IF YOU COME UP THROUGH ACADAMIA YOU DEVELOP A PRETTY FIX SKIN A I G I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT THE THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT WAS REALLY SURPRISE WHEN I STARTED POSING UNSOCIAL THAT I LOVE I LEFT CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM I WAS UNPREPARED FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL NEU JERK CRITICIZE A STUDY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT WHETHER THE METHODS OR MIGOROUS RIGHT Y COME ON IF I POSTED THIS SURELY IT'S AT LEAST WORTH CONCERNING THE POSSIBILITY THT THE STRONG EVIDENCE BEHINDIT RIGHT WELL THAT'S WHERE A A I AM A BRIEF O I WON'T CALL IT A RETOIT BUT A RESPONSE OF YOU KNOW A YOU KNOW I A CLEARLY YOU SHOULD READ THE STUDY FURTHER BECAUSE I THINK YOU'LL BE SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER SOMETHING I DON'T OW A BUT I AGREE IT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT HARSH IN THERE SOMETIMES BUT  YOU KNOW THE SOCIAL MEDIA A CHANNELS ARE I THINK HOW YOU KNOW THEY HAVE IT'S A DOUBLE EDGE PLATE I'M THE OBVIOUSLY HAVE THEIR ISSUES BUT UM CAN BE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION AND SHARE IT QUICKLY THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT TAKES ME OUT OF WHAT I WAS DOING INITIALLY WHICH WAS LEARNING SEARCHING FOR THOSE GEMS WITH WHITH WHICH TO SHARE LATER AND I THINK THERE'S A BROADER LANDSCAPE TO CONSIDER THIS WHERE PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE ARE WAS THAT THE BEACH YESTERDAY S JUST ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR DAY AT THE BEACH ESPECIALLY FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR AND EVERYONE AS TAKING PICTURES OF THAT EXPERIENCE ON THEIR PHONE AND PROBABLY SHARING THAT EXPERIENCE EITHER SOCIAL MEDEOR WITH FRIENDS A THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THEN TAKING A PHOTOGRAPH AND NOT SEEING THAT PHOTOGRAPH UNTIL LATER OR NOT SENDING IT OUT AN SO THERE NOW NER INFINITE NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE ARE TAKING OUT OF THE REWARDING EXPERIENCE I SHOALL REFRASE THAT WE ARE TAKING OURSELVES OUT OF THE REWARDING EXPERIENCE AND FOCUSING ON A DIFFERENT REWARDING EXPERIENCE THAT I THINK BY DEFINITION IS AN EXTRANCE IF REWARD SO WE ARE TAKG OURSELVES OUT OF OUR INTRANTS ARLY REWARDING EXPERIENCES AND ACTIVATING THESE EXTRNTS IF REWARDS AND DO YOU THINK IN ANY WAY THAT'S UNDERMINING OUR EXPERIENCE OF THINGS THAT WE REALLY ENJOY AM AGAIN NOT TO DEMINIZE SOCIAL MEDIA OR THESE CHANNELS BUT AM I'VE PERSONALLY FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO REFRAIN FROM SHARING THIS KNOWLEDGE O M SO EXCITED TO SHARE BUT I DELIBERATELY DELAY AND THERE'S LOT I'VE A DEEP LIST OF FOLDERS FULL OF THINGS THAT I WANT OPPOSED BUT I'VE JUST DOING IT BE NO SYSTEMATICALLY OVER TIME BECAUSE I REALLY FIGHT THE TEMPTATION TO TO DO THIS MOSTLY BECAUSE I WANT TOD COMPTINUE TO ENJOY THIS LEARNING PROCESS IN THIS THE SEEKING PROCESS SO MUCH YET I I FEEL THE SAME THE SAME IM I FEEL TORN I THINK I THINK I WAS E B WHIT WHO SAID I I RISE IN THE MORNING TORN BETWEEN THE DESIRE TO ENJOY THE WORLD AND THE DESIRE TO IMPROVE THE WORLD AND THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PLAN THE DAY ND I I I FEEL THAT EVERY DAY I THINK IVMY NIGHT I EVEN I FELT IT THIS MORNING I WAS O CASE TIME TO IT'S TIME TO LEAVE TO TO COME TO THE THE HUMORMAN POD CASK MI WAIT BUT I DIDN'T HIT MY MINIMUM SUNLIGHT VIEWING WHIT WHAT D M I DO DO I SHOW ON TIME FOR YOU OR DO I MEET YOUR CRITERIA THE THE UM THE EXPLANATION I WAS GETTING MY MORNING SUNLIGHT AND THEREFORE I'M EX NUMBER OF ONE AN THR EVEN HOURS LATE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FINE I VIGURY MUCH YES I TE E I TE BILT AND ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE WITH YOU I THINK EVERY NIGHT I THINK EVERYBODY EXPERIENCE'S AVERSION OF THIS AND I IT'S EVENLY GOTTEN WORSE WITH WAS SOCIAL MEDIA AND WITH SMARTPHONES I I THINK SA ONE OF THE MOST STARTLING DATYPOINTS FOR ME WAS IMTHE GLORYA MARK FIRST TO PUT THIS ON MY RADE AR BEFORE COVED THE AVERAGE PERSON WAS CHECKING EMAIL SEVENTY TWO TIMES A DAY HOW DO YOU EVER CONCENTRATE FOR MORE THAN A COUPLE MINUTES IF YOURSELF INTERRUPTING THAT OFTEN YOU CAN'T IBRIGET SHELTY HAS A GREAT TERM FOR THIS SH SHE CALLS IT TIME CONFETY AND SHE SAYS WE'RE TAKING THESE MEANING FULL BLOCKS OF TIME AND WE'RE SLICING THEM UP INTO THESE TINY LITTLE TOTS OF CONFETY AND NOT ONLY CAN WE NOT ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING WE'RE ALSO WROTING OUR OWN SENSE OF JOY IBECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD TO ENJOY THE YOU KNOW T THE THIRTY SECOND BLIP OF TIME THAT YOU GET ON A TASK IAND I THINK WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THIGS DISTANCE THESE PROBLEMS THAN THEN HOT OSOLVE THEM BUT ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS BLACKING OUT ON AR INTERRUPTED TIME IS MEETINGFUL THERE'S A GREAT LESLIE PARLO EXPERIMENT WHERE SHE TAKES ENGINEERS AND SHE HAS THEM SHE SETS A QUIET TIME POLICY NO INTERRUPTIONS TO SAY THURSDAY FRIDAY BEFORE NOON SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF OVE AVERAGE PRODUCTIVITY COULD YOU REPEAT THE UM THE PROTOCAL YES AT QUIET TIME THER COBLITERATIONS OF IT BUT I THINK THE MOST EFFECTIVE ONE WITH TO SAY THURSDAY FRIDAY NO MEETINGS NO INTERRUPTIONS NO SLACK NO EMALES BEFORE NOON AND DURING THOSE PERIODS OF NO INTERRUPTIONS ONE COULD TEND TO WHATEVER THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE IS AT WORK YETYESOR FOR ME MIGHT BE POTCASTING OBU SAY I WOULD DORNO MY PHONEIN HERE NEVER DO UM BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN NO INTERACTION WITH ANY ONE ELSE IT JUST MEANS FOCASSING ON THE MAJOR T  TASK EXACTLY AND YOU COME IN WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF PRIORITY AND PURPOSE AND I DO'T HIN THERE'S ANYTHINGA MAGICAL ABOUT TO SAY TH A FRIDAY BEFORE NOON IT JUST THE IDEA OF SETTING A BOUNDARY AND COLLECTIVELY COMMITTING TO IT THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE IMPORTNAN AND I THINK WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS II'D BE I'D BE REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR TAKE ON I ONCRONO TYPES HERE BECAUSE I THINK ONE THING IVE LEARNED IN THE AST COUPLE YEARS IS THAT IF YOU'RE A IF YOU'RE MORNING PERSON YOU DO YOUR BEST ANTOLYTICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING IN THE MORNING AND SO THE QUIET TIME BLOCK WOULD WORK VERY WELL FOR FOR ME IS A MORNING PERSON IF YOU'RE NIGHT IWILL YOU PROBABLY WANT THAT BLOCK IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND I WAS ENCOURAGED THERES THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE DURING COVID THAT PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BEST MEETINGS RIGHT AFTER LUNCH THAT THERE SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY PER CENT LESS LIKELY TO MULT I TASK IN AN AFTER LUNCH MEETING I GUESS YOU UCA PROBABLY UNPACK THE THE FRUITCOMA YOU NO'T GETTING REENERGIZED BY OTHER PEOPLE BUT IT'S LED ME TO WONDER IF WE SHOULD ALL BE PROTECTING THE FIRST FEW HOURS IN THE LAST FEW HOURS OF THE DAY FOR DEEP WORK AND AND DOING OUR CORE MEETINGS AND INTERACTIONS AND KIND OF OFF TASK ACTIVITIES IN THE MIDDLE WHAT DO YOUTHINK ABOUT THAT AS A SEQUENCE IVILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS FOR YOU BUT UM I LOVE THAT SEQUENCE IT CERTAINLY FITS WITH MY NATURAL RHYTHMS I I THINK THERE'S AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT PROVIDED ONE IS SLEEPING WELL AT NIGHT AND IS ON A MORE OR LESS A STANDARD SCATUL ONE I SAY STANDAR IMIN GOING TO BED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN LET'S SAY NINE THIRTY AND ELEVEN THIRTY P M WAKING UP SOME TIME BETWEEN LET'S SAY AM SIX A M AN EIGHT A M MAY BE FIVE THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY AM SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO NOT HIGHLY UNUSUAL A NIGHT OWL OR SUPER EARLY BIRD UM FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE FOLLOWING THAT SORT OF SCHADUEL THE FIRST LET'S YOU SAY FROM ZERO TO EIGHT HOURS AFTER WAKING THERE TENDS TO BE A  FAIRLY ROBUST INCREASE IN ALL THE CATACOLOMINE SO DOPE ME NORUP AN EFFRAND UP AND EFEROND WHICH GENERALLY GET GENERALLY SPEAKING A LY TO INCREASES IN ALERTNESS ATTENTION AN FOCUS THAT ARE GREAT FOR ANALYTIC WORK A GREAT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIES THAT YOU ALREADY UNDERSTAND AND YOU NEED TO CHURN THROUGH A LOT OF STUFF AM AND OF COURSE TIR'S A BIG INCREASE IN THE MORNING ESPECIALY IF YOU VEU MORNING SUNLIGHT A HEALTHY INCREASE I SHOULD SAY IN CARTIZAL CORT IS ALL IS NOT BAD FOLKS YOU YOU WANT CORSE ALL BUT YOU WANT THAT PIK EARLY IN THE DAY WE KNOW THAT O CAS SO UM FOR MOST PEOPLE IT SEEMS AT LEAST MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AM THAT PERIOD OF TIMES EROTA EIGHTOR A EIGHT HOURS AFTER WAKING OR SO A IS BEST DEVOTED TO THE QUILINTQUA MOST CRITICAL TASKS BUT ONE OF THE COMMON PROBLEMS IS THAT PEOPLE TAKE THAT A ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT A KNOWN STRATEGY AND THEY START BATTERING BACK ALL THE EMALS OR TALKING TO ALL BY THE WAY TALKING TO CO WORKERS IS GREAT AND IT'S OFTEN REQUIRED BUT IT'S WAT THE QUESTIONS WHETHER NOT'S PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION OR WHETHER NOT JUST CONVERSATION AND WE TEND HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY EARLY IN THE DAY AND I'M I'M OSSESSE WITH THE IDEA OF NORAL ENERGY AS OPPOS TO JUST CHOLORIC ENERGY AM SO THERE WERE TIME UT NURAL ENERGY AND THEN POST LAUNCH SO REALLY I MAS WE GET TO THIS OR OF YOU NO NINE TO SEVENTEEN HOURS AFTER WAKING THERE IS A DIP ANAUTONOMIC AROUSAL THAT DURING THE MIDDLE THE DAY THE POSTPERENDIAL DIP THERE'S A POST LUNCH SLEEPINESS A THAT CAN BE PARTALLY OFFSET BY DELAING YOR MORNING CAFFINE A BIT IF YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON CRASH BUT IT'S INTERESTING THA YOU KNOW THAT A MORE PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS AND LESS A TAST WITCHING AND DISTRACTION OCCURRED A IN MEETING SET AFTER LUNCH BECAUSE THAT MAKES ME THINK THAT PERHAPS BEING A LITTLE BIT LESS ALERT IS GOING TO LEND ITSELF TO MORE FOCUS AND INDEED THAT'S THE THE SORT OF OPTIMAL STATE RELAXED BUT FOCUS YOU NAR NOT SLEEPY A BUT YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE SO MUCH INTRINSIC ENERGY THAT YOUR YOU NOT TING ON TO A LUNCH OF THINGS AS I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DO FEEL THAT WAY YN I'M DRINKING YO DOUBLESTPRESSO RIGHT NOW A LATE MIND MORNING A LATE MORNING A AND OU I CAN SIT STILL BUT I THINK OF CERTAIN ZUME MEETINGS HOW DO I SAY THIS I DON WN'T OFFEND ANY OF MY COLLEAUES ONLY THAT THEY ARE BORNING ENOUGH  THEY ARE NOT CONTENT RICH ENOUGH TO TO GRAB ALL MY ATTENTION AND NOWADAYS OF COURSE THEIR MULTIPLE SCREENS TIPULA AVE GOT TWOPHONES IN A COMPUTER AND YAFT REALLY SPEND SOME WORK TO FLIP OVER THOSE PHONES WHILE IMON AZUMAND THINGS LIKE THAT A SO NELOVROTING SO A SAY SO IT MAY BE THE REDUCTION IN AUTONOMIC AROUSAL THAT THAT SUPPORTS WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED BUT I DON'T KNOW A MY MY THINKING A MY UNDERSTANDING RATHER WAS THAT CREATIVE WORK AND KIND OF A BRAINSTORMING WAS BEST ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LATE AFTERNOON A I'VE NOTICED WHEN LECTURING I'D BE CURIOUS WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE IS WITH A IN UNIVERSITY LECTURES WHEN I HELD COURSES IN THE EVENING I  SO LIKE TO HOLD MY COURSES FIVE TO SEVEN P M R EVEN SEVEN TO NINE THIRTY P M WHEN I WAS TEACHING UNDERGRADUATES THAT PEOPLE WERE MUCH LOOSER AND MORE RELAXED AND I ALWAYS A I THOUGHT THA THAT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH AN INCREASIN GABA TRANSMISSION THAT'S KNOWN TO HAPPEN LATE IN LATE EVENING THE PEWERGE JAS GA MORE RELAXED WHAT AND LESS SOCIAL ANXIETY THEY'VE BEEN AROUND PEOPLE FOR MUCH OF THE DAY AIGT I I I SEND BACK MORE REFLECTIONS AND ANSWERS I I DON'T HAVE ANY FIRM NERASIGNCE EXPLANATIONS FOR WHAT YOU DESCRIBED BUT BUT THERE 'RE SOME EMERGING THEORIES ABOUT HOW IT MIGHT WORK AND T HAS THE ZERO TO NINE HOURS FACE ONE NINE TO SEVENTEEN HOURS FACE TOO AN THEN OF COURSE FROM SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS I'LLCALL IT FACE STREET YOU SHOULD BE ASLEEP IDEALLY WELL THAT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A CONFOUND IN YOUR YOUR TEACHING EXPERIENCE WHICH AS UNDERGADS OFTEN SLEEP IN UNTIL WHAT NOON ORDER THEY MIGHT BE UP IN TILL FOR I AM OR AT LEAST TEN A MS SEEMS TO BE A TYPICAL RISE TINE OUT OF THE UNDERGROUD SO IN A MORNING CLASS MIGHT BE TOO EARLY FOR THEM TO BE FULLY AWAKE BUT THERE IS  THERE'SOME PRAN NEW EVIDENCE THAT AT LEAST ON CREATE TO BE AT WORK I I READ IT A SERIES OF THIS THREE STUDIES RECENTLY SHOWING THAT EARLY BIRDS ACTUALLY DID DO MORE CREATIVE WORK IN THE MORNING AND IN PART I THINK AGAIN THAT I DON'T  ADAMY ANY NARROW SCIENTIST HAS HAS TOUCHED THE MECHANISMS ON THIS YET BUT IN TURM TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSIES EARLY ON THERE'S JUST THERE SEEMS TO BE A BENEFIT OF OF THE ENERGY LEVEL I AND SOMEOF THAT ENERGY LEADS TO MORE DIVERGENT THINKING AND LATER IF YOU'RE MORNING PERSON YOU MIGHT LOSE THE ABILITY TO TO DIVERGE QUITE AS MUCH AND SO YOU END UP IN A MORE CONVENTIONAL SPACE OF THOUGHT DOES THAT DOES THAT TRACK AT ALL WITH YOURUNDERSTANDING OF HOW HEY MIGHT PLAY OUT IN THE BRAIN MINE ER CHANGE IS TO BE  BIT IN IT WOULD BE INDIVIDUAL BUT YET THERE IS SOMETHING TO THESE LIMINAL STATES BETWEEN SLEEP AND WAKING SO MAYBE WE CAN AM RAP A CONV ENIENT BOW AROUND WHAT I SAID IN WHAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID WHICH IS A THAT WE KNOW THAT IN THE TRANSITION STATES INTO AN HOUT OF SLEEP AND IT DOESN'T ASSARILY HAVE TO BE WITHIN THE FIRST HALF HOUR IN AND OUT OF SLEEP THAT A THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE DIVERGENT THINK YONG ARE LEAST ACTIVATION OF NERAL NET WORKS THAT A ARE NOT AS CONSTRAINED AS ONE OBSERVES WHEN THERE IN A IN A SHEER TASK AND STRAGY IMPLEMENTATION MODE RIGHT I MEAN I THINK IS THEN A SIMILAR TO THE SHOWER EFFECT THE SHOWER OFFACT O PEOLE OF IDEAS IN SHOWT WHA OR WHILE RUNNING OR O'M WHILE FALLING ASLEE EP OR MY BEST IDEAS ALWAYS COME WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR AFTER WAKING THAT'S WH I CARRY A NOTEBOOK ROUND IN WICH THIS MAY OF PEOPLE MY LIFE OFTENTIMES I I DON'T WANT TO HEAR OR WER TALKED ANY ONE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING ATIS THIS PROBLEMATIC AND I HAD TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS WILL TALK ABOUT ADJUSTMENTS BETWEEN A A PRODUCTIVITY AND AS A CONTROL AND AND A FAMILY INTERACTIONS THIS IS SOMETHING I KNOW YOU YOU'VE WORKED ON AND WRITTEN ABOUT AM BUT THOSE LIMINAL STATES ARE ARE INTERESTING AND AND I'D LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS A I'VE HAD SEVERAL GUESTS ON THIS PODCASTS TALK ABOUT THEIR CREATIVE PROCESS A NAMELY RIC REUBEN A S FAMOUS FOR HIST WORK IN MUSIC OF PRODUCING ALSO AS A GREAT PODCAST OGREMATON AM AS WELL AS CALLED DICEROT THE COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHOS REALLY IN THE POINT ZEROZEROZEERO ONE PER CENT OF AM SUPERTALENTED BYO ENGINEERS NOR SCIENTIST WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A FULL TIME AM CLINICAL PSYCHIATRIST AND HAS FIVE CHILDREN O K AM AND I ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR CREATIVE PROCESS CAUSE BOTH OF THEM ARE VERY CREATIVE A CARL'S PROCESS INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING LATE AT NIGHT FOR HIM BUT IT COULD REALLY BE ANY TIME OF DAY DELIBERATELY MAKING HIS BODY AS STILL AS POSSIBLE AND FORCING HIMSELF TO THINK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES RICKS CREATIVE PROCESS ALTHOUGH IT INCLUDES A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH ALSO GETTING VERY STILL LYING DOWN O K OTHER FOLKS THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO ACADEMICS AND AN ARTISTS HAVE REFERRED TO GETTING THEIR BODY INTO MOTION BUT QUIETING THEIR MIND SO THESE ARE TWO OPPOSITE PROCESSES ONE CASE THE BODY IS STILL BUT THE MIND IS DELIBERATELY VERY ACTIVE IN THE OTHER SENARIO THE BODY IS VERY ACTIVE BUT THEY'RE MAKING THEIR MIND SORT OF IN FREE ASSOCIATION NOT STILL BUT THEY'RE NOT DELIBERATELY THINKING ABOUT ANY ONE THING FASCIN AND I'M OBSESSED WITH THIS MAYBE WE YOU AND I COULD WORK ON THIS YOU KNOW I DO FIRT SEBATICAL MAY WE COULD FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUS I HAVE AYTHING ANY ONSUDY THIS BEFORRIGHT BECAUSE THETHE  THE NERVOUS SIST NO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HI AM NOT AWARE OF ANYONE AS DONE IT FORMELLY EITHER THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF COURSE IS AM IS A BRAIN BODY PHENOMENON AND SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SORT F CUT OFF THE DELIBERATE OPERATIONS OF BRAIN OR BODY AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER WHETHER NOT ITS BRAIN OR BODY AS LONG AS ONE AS DELIBERATELY SHUT OFF AND SO ANYWAY I LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS AM I DON'T CONCERN MYSELF WLIKE A ALTER CREATIVE OR CREATIVE TYPE I'M TO ANY GREAT DEGREE BUT ME NEITHER HONT O  BUT I'M FU ASCINATING IT YORE RIGHT BUT I  TURIN YOU'R RIGHT BUT THATS SO BUT I'M FASTINING BY THESE DELIBERATE TACTICS THAT HIGHLY CREATIVE PEOPLE HAVE HAVE A UNDERTAKEN I' IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT IDEAS I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME OF MY BEST IDEAS WHEN I'M RUNNING AND I'LL JUST BE RUNNING ON MY GOODNESS I WAT S EVEN THINKING I I NEED TO WRITE THIS TOWN OR CAME THAN CONTINUE II TRIED THE DICER ROUTH APPROACH AND THAT THE REUBEN APPROACH ACTURALLY TOS SPEND A WEEK WITH RICK I'M OVERSEES AND INDEED HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME JUST STILL THINKING AND IT'S A VERY HARD PRACTICE TO GET AM TO GET CONSISTENT WITH I WONDER I WONDER IF THEIR INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES HERE ON AN WHICH NEEDS TO BE STABLE OR STEADY I I THINK YU I'T THINK ABOUT A HUGE PART OF CREATIVITY IS AN IS OVERRITING YOUR DEFAULT INSTINCTS AND IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHOSE DEFAULT IS TO HAVE YOUR MIND CONSTANTLY GOING THEN QUIETING WOULD PROBABLY SHIFT YOUR YOUR TRAIN OF THOUGHT TO SOMETHING MORE ORIGINAL OR UNCONVENTIONAL I' THE OPPOSITE MIGHT BE TRUE IF YOU HAVE A NATURALLY QUIET MIND I WOULD IMAGINE YOU NEED IT YOU NEED IT SORT OF JOLT YOURSELF OUT OF THAT WITH LOTS OF ACCESS TO NET TO FREE RANGING THOUGHTS AND SO I  BE INTERESTING ACTUALLY TO STUDY WHETHER WE CAN PREDICT WHAT YOU SHOULD STILL BASED ON YOUR PERSONALITY I WANT AND MAYBE WHAT WE COULD DO IN THAT STUDY ITHINK WE HAVE A COLLABORATION BREWING IN OTHERS JOKING TO TWO SCIENTISTS WALK INTO A ROOM AND WHAT COMES OUT AS A COLLABORATION SO IM I'D WONTO PUT PEOPLE IN A SCANNER IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE TREAD MILLING IN A SCANNER BECAUSE A MOVEMENT ARENT TO FACT BUT AND JUST LOOK AT NET A RESTING NETWORK ACTIVATION AND COMPARE THAT TO RESTING NET WORK ACTIVATION WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY STILL AND FORCING THEMSELVES TO THINK AN DELIVERATE O SEND AND THEN LOOK AT THE OVERLAP IN THAT THAN DIAGRAM THAT'S WHAT'S OF INTEREST TO ME THEY MAY BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BRAIN STATES THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE MORE SIMILARITY THAN DIFFERENCES I WONDER THAN IF YOU CAN TIE THAT TO DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF OUTPUT SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF EITHER KIND OF MOVEMENT IS THAT YOU A YOU ANT UP INCREASING THE VOLUME OF IDEAS WHICH WE KNOW IS GOOD FOR VARIETY AND ULTIMATELY INCREASES THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU STUMBLE ON TO SOMETHING NEW BUT THAND I THINK THIS THE BEING STILL PART IS PROBABLY BETTER FOR THE FILTERING PROCESS IV I THINK ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS OF CREATIVITY IS ACTUALLY JUDGING YOUR OWN IDEAS  MOST MOST CREATIVE PEOPLE HAVE MANY TERRIBLE IDEAS IN FACT THET MOST CREATIVE PEOPLE HAVE THE MOST HORKED LITEAS ABECAUSE THEY JUST HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS AND I I THINK THIT MAYBE THERE'S A THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH QUIETING EITHER YOUR BIDYN OR YOUR MIND ALLOWS YOU TO GAIN SOME DISTANCE FROM THE IDEA AND SEE WHEATHER IT'S BONE HEADED OR PROMISING I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND THANK OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACOR INSIDE

CENT OFF THEIR FULL WEB SIGHT AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKER DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN ALON THOSE LINES WHEN ONE IS TRYING TO GAUGE THE QUALITY OF THEIR IDEAS UM HOW DO YOU COPE WITH OR HOW DOES ONE COPE WITH NOT PLACING A JUDGE ON THAT THAT UM CAUSES SOME UNI FALSE NEGATIVES WHERE YOU WERE YOUR WIPING OUT GREAT IDEAS BECAUSE UM OU NO RICK REUBEN TALKS A LOT ABOUT YOU KNOW DON'T GIVE THE AUDIENCE WHAT THEY WANT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT THY HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET IF IT'S A TRULY CREATIVE IDEA THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND UM BUT OF COURSE WE ALL HAVE TO DEVELOP OUR OWN SENSE OF TASTE SO WELL HOW DOES THIS PROCESS WORK FOR YOU I MEAN YOU RIN ABOUT AND WORKED ON A TREMENDOUS RANGE OF TOPICS UM AN ALWAYS I MUST SAY WITH WITH SUCH RIGOR AND SUCH CLARITY OF COMMUNICATION ABOUT THOE  OJECTS YETT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE MEAN LIKE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SO WE SAY AROUND HERE NO WEEK SAUCE YOU KNOW AND ER IS NO WEEK SAUCE IN YOUR A GAME IT'S INCREDIBLE SO UM WHEN DO YOU GET YOUR IDEAS AND HOW DO YOU FILTER THOSE IDEAS I FEEL LIKE THE WEN COULD BE ANY TIME I THINK THE  YOU'VE YOU'VE V CLEARLY EXPERIENCE THIS TO FOR ME THE BEST THING ABOUT HOSTING A PODCAST IS I HAVENAT EXCUSE TO LEARN ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT FROM ALMOST ANY ONE I WANT AND I GET TO CALL THAT PART OF MY JOB AND SO I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THAT HAVING THAT BUILT AND MECHANISM FOR LEARNING MEANS IDEAS COULD COULD COME AT ANY MOMENT THE THE FILTERING PROCESS FOR ME IS I IT'S EVOLVED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WHAT I BUT I DO NOW IS IF I'M THAT SAM I'M STARTING ANY BOOK I'LL READ A DRAFT TO THE FIRST CHAPTER AND I SEND IT TO FIVE TO EIGHT PEOPLE WHOSE JUDGMENT I TRUST AND BY DESIGN SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN MY FEELD THER NO DEEP SEATED IN ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY OTHERS ARE YOU KNOW VERY FAR OUT I'D BUT CURIOUS ABOUT THE TOPICS I'M INTERESTED IN AND I ASKD THEM FOR IS ER TO TEND SCOR THIS IS THE MAY IELEARN TO DO AS I AS A SPRINGBARD DIVER WHERE I WOULD I WOULD TAKE OFF I'M AND I'M DOING E A FEW FLIPS OR TWISTS AND I THINK MY DIVE AS GOOD BUT I CAN'T SEE IT AS I'M HURLING AND MID AIR AND IT'S OF EVERYTHING'S A BLUR AND SO I HAVE TO RELY ON MY COACH TO TELL ME IF IT WAS ANY GOOD I FEEL THAT CREATIVE WORK AS THE SAME WAY YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO IT TO KNOW HOW THE AUDIENCES GAN REACT TO IT AND YES YOU DON'T WANT O CREATE IT JUST FOR THE AUDIENCE BUT THE END OF THE DAY YOU WANTED TO BE YOU KNOW INTERESTING OR USEFUL TO THEM SO I ASKE FOR THE YEAR TO TENT AND NO ONE EVER SAYS TEN AND TAND I USE THAT IS A CALIBRATION MECHANISM SO IF EVERYBODY IS IN THE SEVEN OR EIGHT RANGE I KNOW THAT I'M ON TO SOMETHING PROMISING AND NOW I NEED A REFINE IT F I GET MUC TO TWOS THREES THREE AND A HALFS YET I EITHER NEED A RETHINK THE IDEA OR DRAMATICALLY REWRITE HOW I'M POSITIONING IT AND I THINK ONE OFTHE MISTAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKE IS THEY KNOW THEY NEED FEED BACK ON THEIR IDEAS THEY GO TO ONE OR TWO PEOPLE AND THEY START TO FEEL A LITTLE BITS EFENSIVE OR THREATENED AND THEIR EGO GETS INVOLVED AND THEN THEY DON'T ASK FOR ANY MORE WHAT THEY DON'T REALIZES IT'S ACTUALLY LESS PAINFUL IF YOU GET MORFEE BACK BECAUSE WHEN EIGHT DIFFERENT PEOPLE CRETIQUE YOUR WORK YOU START TO REALIZE THAT A FEW OF THE COMMENTS THAT SORT OF BRUISY A LITTLE BIT WE'RE JUST ADIOSAN CRATIC AND NO ONE ELSE CARED ABOUT THOSE ISSUES BUT THEN FIVE PEOPLE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM THAT IS NOT TASTE THAT IS A QUALITY ISSUE AND I'VE GOT A FOCUS ON THAT AND SO IT REALLY HELPS TO FILTER WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARETHE ROVISIONS I NEED TO MAKE WHAT AR THE PROBLEMS AND COMPLAINTS I NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO VERSES WHAT CAN IGNORK AS MAYBE THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT FOR THAT PERSON I'M RECALLING WHEN I WAS A POSTOC A HAD A MANUSCRIPT FULLY PREPARED AND I WORKED IN A LABORATORY WHERE I DIDN'T WORK ON THE SAME THING AS MY POSTORC ADVISER HE WAS VERY GRACIOUS IN LETTING MEY BE THE OUTWIRE UM AND HE SAID WELL I DON'T KNOW ANYTHIN ABOUT THIS TOPIC SO BEFORE YOU SUBMIT IT TO THIS FERTLY PROSTIGIOUST VERY FRANKLY VERY PROCEDIOUS JOURNAL I'LVL BE HONEST A YOUSHALL I GO DOWN THE HALL AND HANDED TO SO AND SO I DON'TAIT WAS CAUSE I'M STILL IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT A AND I GAVE IT TO HIM THIS INDIVIDUAL AND HE LOOKED DOWN HE SAID YET YOU NON IT LOOKS INTERESTING BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S CAN TO BE A WHOLE LOT OF INTEREST IN THESS IS JUST LIKE NOT I'L TINK NO WAY LIKE THIS I THINK THIS IS REALLY COOL BUT I WAS PRETTY DISMAYED SOSI CACASO I DO SO WENT BACK TO MY ADVISER AND THANKFULLY HE'S A BIT OF AN ICONICLASS AND HE SAID THAT'S THE BEST FEED BACK YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN DEFINITELY SUBMIT ED TO THAT PARTICULAR JOURNAL AND I MUST SAY THAT PAPER GOT ACCEPTED FASTER THAN ANY OTHER PAPER I'VE NEVER HAD AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT I MEAN IT REQUIRED SOME PROVISIONS I REMEMBER THINKING LIKE WEL WHAT AN UNUSUAL RESPONSE TO AFTER HAVING INSTRUCTED ME TO GO ASKA A MORE SENIOR COLLEAGUE RAYS OF AT THE TIME ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AND THEN TO GET THE NEG IT SENCHALLY NEGATIVE RESPONSE AND THEN TO TAKE THAT AS LIKE YO SHOULD DEAFINLY SEND IT OUT IT REALLY TAUGHT ME A LESSON THAT SOMETIMES ONE NEEDS TO INVERT THERE UM THEIR ACTION ACCORDING A TO THE NEGATIVE FEE BACK THEY GET NOT ALWAYS BUT A'M THOR'S AN END OF ONE O CASATSN IT NOT A SHOULD BE EXTRAPLATE TO TOO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT UM BASY LED ME TO UM NOT SEEK OUT A FEED BACK PRIOR TO SUBMISSION OF THINGS TERRIBLY OFTEN I MEAN A I CHECK INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY PRIOR TO PODCASSIN CHECK THE VALIDITY OF THE INFORMATION AND PODCASTSIN PAPERS BUT UM IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT PEOPLE'S OPINIONS CAN BE LIKE PIDLY IDIOS ANCRATIC AND AND IN SOME CASES OUTRIGHT WRONG AND REALLY THE THE OPINION OF THE JOURNAL IS WHATWHAT MATTERED MOST IN IN TERMS OF GETTING IT ACCEPTED OR NOT SO U HOW DO YOU YOU SAID GIVE IT TO THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUT IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA THERE'S A SALIENCE TO NEGATIVE COMMENTS SO HOW SHALL WE FILTER POSITIVEORSIS NEGATIVE FE BACK WELL THERE'S A HER'S METANA LSIS HERE THIS IS CLEAGER AND DENICY I'M LOOKING AT A HUNDRED YEARS OF FEED BACK RESEARCH AND THEY FOUND THAT WHAT DRIVES THE UTILITY OF FEED BACK IS NOT WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT'S WHETHER IT FOCUSES ON THE TASK OR ON THESELF SO IF I TELL YOU THAT YOUR WORK IS TERRIBLE YOU'RE GOING TO GET DEFENSIVE IF I TELL YOU THAT YOUR WORK IS GREAT YOU'RE GOIG TO GET COMPLACENT IF I TELL YOU HERE'S THE SPECIFIC THING THAT I LIKED ABOUT YOUR WORK YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO LEARN TO REPEAT BAT AND IF I TELL YOU HERE'S THE THING I DIDN'T LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIX IT SO I ACTUALLYTHINK WE SHOULD WORRY LESS ABOUT WHETHER THE FEED BACK IS ENCOURAGING OR DISCOURAGING AND MORE ABOUT HOW DO I MAKE SURE THAT I GET INPIT THAT'S CAN ALLOW ME TO LEARN FROM MY STRENGTH AND ALSO OVERCOME MY WEAKNESSES I'M AND ACTUALLY I ONE THINGS IVE I'VE LEARNED RECENTLY IS THERE'S SOME IOULD SAY GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT THAT ASKING FOR FEE BACK IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO HELP YOU IM BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK FOR FEED BACK YOU END UP GETTING TWO GRUPS OF PEOPLE YOU GET CHEER LEADERS AND YOU GET CRITICS AND CHEER LEADERS ARE VASICALLY APPLAUDING YOUR BESTSELF CRITICS ARE ATTACKING YOUR WORSELF WHAT YOU WANT IS A COACH WHICH IS SOMEBODY WHO HELPS YOU BECOME A BETTER VERSION OF YOURSELF AND THE WAY YOU GET PEOPLE TO COACH YOU IS NOT TO SAY GIVE ME FEED BACK BECAUSE THEY WILL THEN LOOK AT THE PAST AND TELL YOU WHAT YOU SCREWED UP OR WHAT YOU DID RIGHT WHAT YOU WANT IS TO SAY CAN YOU GIVE ME ADVICE FOR NEXT TIME AND THEN THEY LOOK INTHE FUTURE AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU EITHER A NORTE ON SOMETHING TO REPEAT OR SOMETHING TO CORRECT AND THIS IS SUCH A SUBTLE SHIFT BAT I CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE I'M EVERYONE  THINKS I'VE I GUESS I FOUND MYSELF APPLYING THIS TO A LOT IS I'M I AFTER GOVING SPEECHES I USED TO GET OFF STAGE AND SAY I'LD LOVE SOME FEED BACK AND YOU GET BACK A MUCH OF OH YOU KNOW I REALLY ENJOYE THAT THANKS WHAT IF I DO WITH THAT INFORMATION I'M TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO GET BETTER AND WHEN I SHIFT THE QUESTION TO SAY WHAT'S THE ONE THING I COAND DO BETTER NEXT TIME OH DON'T OPEN WITH THE JOKE THE AUDIENCE CAN TELL YOU AR JOKING I'M I FREQUENTLY IT'S GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A THROUGH LINE YOU FOCUSSED A LOT ON YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF INTERESTING POINTS BUT I LOST THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND YET THERE'S THOSE ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO COME WHEN YOU JUST ASK FOR A TIP I SUPPOSE TO AN AVALUATION IT'S SO GOOD AMINOUST PAUSE FOR A SECOND I I'VENEVER TAKEN A PAUSH I'VE TAKEN OCCASIONAL PAUS BUR AT TO BE OSE BUT THEY'RE VERY RARE OM AS THE AUDIENCE KNOWS OH THAT THAT'S JUST GAZILIAN DOLLAR ADVICE BECAUSE I THINK THAT I' EVERYONE HAS AN EGO WE ALL WANT TO PERFORM WELL WE'D LIKE TO PERFORM BETTER OVER TIME AND NEGATIVE HE BACK HURTS AND IT CAN HURT A LITTLE OR A LOT DEPENDING ON HOW DEFENSIVE WE ARE BUT A TOOL LIKE YOU JUST DESCRIBE TO IREMOVE SOME OF THAT DEFENSIVE ARMOR THAT WE ALL HAVE AND AND ACTUALLY LET THE INFORMATION IN IN A WAY THAT'S CONSTRUCTIVE I'S REALLY GREAT WHAT YOU DESCRIBED I THINK IS A WAY TO CREATE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM BUT THE CONSTRUCTIVE PART IS REALLY COMING FROM WITHIN I SUPPOSE TO SAYING I'D LIKE SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM AND THEN HOPING THAT THE CRITICISM IS ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTIVE SO YOU'RE TAKING  CONTROL OVER THE PROCESS IN A HEALTHY AY IN A BENEVOLENT AY THAT THAT'S THE GOAL AND I THINK THE THE BEQUESTION AT COMES UP FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THIS POINT IS E SO I GET SOMEBODY TO GIVE ME ADVICE BUT IT MIGHT STILL STINK HOW DO I GET BETTER AT TAKINE AT CONSTRUCTIVELY ANDS I THINK PROBABLY MY FAVORITE TACHNIC ON THIS I LEARNED FROM SHELAKHIN SHE CALLS IT THE THE SECOND SORE AN THE IDEAIS THAT WHEN SOMEBODY GIVES YOU  A PIECE OF CRITICISM THAT'S YOUR FIRST SCORE SO THAT SAY HAT A I IN MY IN MY WORLD THEY GAVE ME A THREE AND A HALF AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW I CAN DO BETTER NEXT TIME HOW DO I GET MYSELF TO FOCUS ON THAT WHAT IDEA IS SAY I WANT TO GET A TEN FOR HOW WELL I TOOK THE THREE AND A HALF AND THAT'S THE SECOND SCORE I WANT TO O VALUATE MYSELF AND HOW WELL I TOOK THE FIRST SCORE I I THINK ABOUT THIS ALMOST EVERY DAY THERE WAS A I SHAL I I TELL YOU QUIC STORY SO WHEN I WAS AT RIGHT OUT OF MY DOCTOR IT I GOT ASKED TO TEACH A A MOTIVATION CLASS FOR EIRFORSE GENERALS AND COLONELS I WAS TWENTY FIVE I THINK TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX A OUNOTHE'R THEY'RE ALL TWICE MY AGE I THEY'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF FLYING HOURS THEY'VE GOT BILLION DOLLAR BUDGETS THEY'VE GOT WELL YOU KNOW THIS COMMUNITY WELL THEIR NICKNAMES STRIKER IN SAND DUNE AND I WAS EXTREMELY INTIMIDATED SO I I WALKED IN THERE AND I I THOUGHT I HAD TO IMPRESS THEM AND I STARTED TALKING ABOUT MY CREDENTIALS AND ALL MY RESEARCH EXPERIENE AND THE FEED BACK AT THE END OF THE FOUR HOUR SESSION WAS BRUTAL I REMEMBER I READIN THE FEED BACK FORMS AND ONE PERSON HAD WRITTEN MORE KNOWLEDGE IN THE AUDIENCE THAN ON THE POTIUM TRUE I CAN'T PORCURE THAT AND THEN ANOTHER UT I GAINED NOTHING FROM THIS SESSION BUT I TRUST THE INSTRUCTOR GAIN USEFUL INSIGHT AND THAT THAT WAS DEVASTATIN IS LIKE CAN I I WOUD REALLY LIKE TO TRANSFORM INTO AN ACTUAL BEAR AND HIGBERNATE NEXT FOUR MONTHS AND THEN MAYBE I'LL COME OUT OF A WHOLE READY TO HEAR THIS AND HAVE THAT OPTION I HAD COMMITTED TO TEACH A SECOND SESSION A WEEK LATER IT'S ALL I COULD DO WAS FIGURE OUT HOW M I GET HEAR THIS FEEDBACK CAND EALLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY ANDI GUESS I PLIED A VERSION O THE SECOND SCORE AND I SAID I THERHETHER SOME GENERALS THAT ARE OING TO COME BACK AND SEE ME AGAIN AD H'VE GOT A PROVE TO THEM THAT I WAS OPEN TO FEED BACK AND ONE OF THINGS I HEARD LAUD IN CLEAR WAS THAT THEY VALUED HUMILITY AND I HAD LED WITH TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE WHICH WAS JUST IN SECURITY MASED AND SO I THOUGHT OKEHOW TO I HOW QUIE CHANGED THE CUASION AND WALKED IN LOOKED AT THE ROOM AND I SAID I KNO IT YOUREALL THINKING IT NOW WHAT COULDI POSSIBLY LEARN FROM PRPROFESSOR WHO'S TWELVE YEARS OLD DEAD SILENCE OH NO SIS THI IS GOING TO HORRIBLY WRONG AND THAN I W NE OFTHE GEYES IN THE AUDIENCE I JOHMPSON IS I AH THAT'S RIDICULOUS HE HOUD OF AT LEASE THIRTEEN EVERYBODY STARTED LAUGHING IT BROKE THE ICE AND I THINK WHAT A WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS TO TAKE MYSELF OFF THE PEDISTAL AND SAY LUCK I HEARD YOUR FEET BACK YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK I HAD ANYTHING TO TEACH YOU AND I'VE GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RGHT UP FRONT AND BE OPEN TO THE FACT THAT THAT'S TRUE AND SO I WANT TO COMING HERE LEARN FROM YOU AND I WANT TO SEE IF I CAN CURATE A CONVERSATION WHERE WE ALL AND UP LEARNING AND THE FE BACK WAS NIGHET AND DAY DIFFERENT AFTERWARD I A WON ON PERSON WROUTE ALTHOUGH JUNIOR IN EXPERIENCE THE PROFESSOR DEALT WITH THE EVIDENCE IN AN INTERESTING WAY IHT I'LL TAKE IT AND I'M THERE'S OMETHING REALLY POWERFUL ABOUT ABOUT SAYING LUCK N I  CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY HATED MY SESSION WHAT I CAN DO IS CONVINCED THEM THAT I WAS MOTIVATED TO LEARN FROM THEIR CRITICISM II LOVE THIS CONCEPT OF THE SECOND SCORE AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT STORY I THINK UM YOU VERY OFTEN U WE HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO IF PEOPLE THEDN CATCH THE MATH IN THERE A YOU ERE OPAGED BY AGED TWENTY FIVE UM AND AS FAR AS I KNOW THE THE YOUNGEST TENDER PROFESSOR A PEN AT TWENTY EIGHT SO THESE ARE OUTRAGEOUS A OUTRAGEOUSLY IMPRESSIVE U NETRICS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT FOR YOU TO SHARE UM A STORY ABOUT A YOU KNOW UM LESS THAN OPTIMAL PROFORMENTS AND HOW YOU ADJUSTED TO IT AND AND AM THE INCORPORATION OF THE THE SECOND SCORE UM THAT YOU REFERRING TO I THINK IS A IS REALLY APPRECIATED BECAUSE I THINK THAT UM AS MUCH AS WE HEAR YOU KNOW OH YOU KNOW JORDAN YOU TOOK MANY MORE YOU KNOW FREETHROWS AND EVERYONE JUST THINKS ABOUT ALL THE ONES HE MADE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT ALL THE ONES HE MADE AT'S THE WAY THE GAME WORKS THT'S THE WAY THE MIND WORKS I SHOULD SAY SO IT'S UM APPRECIATE THAT YOU' FLUSH IT OUT WITH A WITH A PERSONAL EXAMPLE I TOO WOULD WANT TO TURN INTO A BARRON DISAPPEAR WHY I  BUT I THINK THAT UM IT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE WHAT YOU DID AND AND I AND IT MAKES ME THINK THAT THE SECOND SCORE OF GETTING A TEN IT AT BRINGING THE THREE AND A HALF UP RIGHT A AS IT WERE UIS REALLY ABOUT TURNING A SCORE INTO A VERB PROCESS YOUKW OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS I DO THIS PODCAST AND AND AS I'VE TAUGHTEN THE CLASSFROM WHEN I KEEP COMING BACK TO IS I IDEA THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSSING MORE ON VERBS AND LESS ON NOUNS WE LOVE TO NAME THINGS AND CATEGRIZE THEM BUT BUT WHEN WE START LIVING LIFE THROUGH A LOT OF VERB PROCESSY SO INSTEAD OF GETTING BEING FIT I'M WETHNG ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW A RUNNING AS A THING REALLYA THING ABOUT LIKE JUST RUNNING RIGHT TET BECOMES LESS DAUNTING AND AND WE ACCOMPLISH FAR MORE BUT THE IDEA THAT A YOU KNOWT THES AS TIS THEIR MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF THE SUMPSURE BUT WHERE YOU'RE BASY TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE AN INTERGRAL RIGHT AS SUPPOSED TO JUST SOME VALUE BUT YOU' TIME BUT THE SLOPE OF THE LINE BIGHT SO YOUARE THREE AND A HALF HOW ARE YOUGING TO GET TO A TEN GOSH THAT'S A HUGE GAP AND YOU'R DEALING WITH  BACK ON YOUR HEEL PSYCHOLOGICALLY FROM GETTING ALL THIS UN O BATTERING FEED BACK FROM THESE A YOU KNOW THESE A HIGHLY COMPLISHED INDIVIDUALS ALL THESE A TRSON A YOU KNOW LIERALLY WEARING THEM PRESUMABLY ON THEIR BODY I SEE FOR YOU TO SEE AND AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT CREATING IT'S ABOUT TAKING CONTROL THE SLOPE OF THAT LINE FROM THE THREE ONWARD AND IT'S REALLY A FORWARD LOOKING PERSPECTIVE SO I DON'T THING WE'RE BEING UN UNUNDULY A PSYCHOLOGICAL HERE ANOLITIC I MAY THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT TAKING A MOMENT STATE AND A NOWN AND TURNING IT INTO A VERV YE I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I  FROM HIME A A GREAT PHILOSOPHER HOMER SIMPSON WHOA THAT VERBING WEIRDS LANGUAGE ISO IT'S HARDED TO TALK ABOUT IS I IN VER I SWEAR IT IND STEAL IT FROM THE SIMPSONS BUT IF IT CAME FROM HOMER SIMPSON LI AM ALL FOR I UONM THAT'S ESMALL TRAIN AT OF A SMALL BRAIN BUT YOU KNOW GIVEN THE SIZE OF HIS BRAIN PEOPLE HAVESEEN THE IMAGE A A YOU KNOW FAIRLY FAIRLY ROBUST KNOWLEDGE VER II VENTURE ON TO SOMETH THINK I VERBS ARE ACTIVE AND WERE WE'RE DRAWN TO THEM I I THINK YET A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE REVIEW THEIR PAST WORK AND THEY JUST THEY END UP SHAMING AN EARLIER VERSION OF THEMSELVES IN THE THEY WALLOW AN RUMINATION AND WET WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO IN THAT SITUATION WHICH IS EASIER SED THEN DONE IS SAY I PURPOSIVE YOU KNOWEV OF GETTING THREE BACK OR ADVICE IS NOT TO SHAME MY PASS THIT'S TO EDUCATE MY FUTURE SELF A WHUCH I THINK I'S VERY CONNECTED TO A LOWD THE WORK ON GROWTHMINE SET THAT THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND  THERE'S BEEN A FIRE STORT OF CONTROVERSY AROUND I CAN WE TEACHGRIPT GROWTHMINE SETINE SCHOOLS LATELY AND A I THINK BUT WUT THAT IS UNDERSCORT FOR ME IS BUT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T EXPECT SOME ONE TO LISTEN TO ONE PODCAST EPISODE OR GO THROUGH ONE WORKSHOP AND MAGICALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF LEARNING ANYTHING AT ANY MOMINT ATHIS AS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO ACTIVELY WORK ON ON A DAILY BASIS AND PART OF DOING THAT EXACTLY AS YOU'VE SAID IS THINKING ABOUT THE SLIP AND SAYING IRIGHT A THE PERSON THAT I  I'M COMPUTING WITH IS MY PASELF AND I WANT O GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER TO DAY THAN I WAS YESTERDAY YE I THINK AM ALONG LINES A GROWTHMIN SAND I WAS SEE WE BOTH NO CARRLL TWACK AND RESPECT HER TREMENDOUSLY AND I AM I REALIZE THERE IS SOME CONTROVERSY NOW AROUND HOW YOU READILY ONE CAN TEACH GROWTHMINE SETTER IN CORPORATE GROWTHMINES AT MY UNDERSTANDING AND A LOVETO NO A YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS IS THAT WHEN THE DWACK WORK IS COMBINED WITH SOME OF THE ALY CRUM WORK THAT IS GROTHMINE SAT IS COMBINE WITH A KNOWLEDGE JUST A BASIC AND TRUE UNDERSTANDING THAT STRESS AND THE FEELINGS OF ANXIETY AND TENTION THAT AM CAN ACTUALLY BE PERFORMANCE EN HANCING WHEN THOSE TWO THINGS ARE COMBINED I THINK THIES THE WORK OF DAVID YAGER IN COLLEGUES AT EUTIAUSTIN THAT A INDEED GROWTHMINES TAT BECOMES A MORE VISIBLE IN O IN OUR A MINE SETS AN PERFORMANCE AM AND ARE THERE OTHER ASPECTS TO GROWTHMINE SAID AND AND OTHER AM OTHER MIND SETS THAT ARE NOW BEING WOVEN INTO THAT FRAME WORK THAT THAT CAN BE HELPFUL BECAUSE I KNOW AM GASH IF EVER THERE WAS A GREAT NAME FOR A ARYOF PSYCHOLOGY GROWTHMINES AT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YYOU WANT EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND EVERYTHING YOU SOR OEF NEED TO KNOW IND JUST THE NAME AM BUT I WE ALL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT I'M JUST TELLING MYSELF I'M NOT AS GOOD AS SOMETHING AS I COULD BE YET IT SOUNDS GREAT BUT IN MOMENTS A OF YOU KNOW RECEIVING FEED BACK AH THAT'S HARSH UMSOMETIMES IT'SHARD TO ACKS US YET T IS I THINK SO THE THE LATEST ES A MAGNAMERA I'M AT ALL MET ANALYSIS AND THAN YAUN I THINK SERVE THAT CAMPPHRSIS THE THE CAROL IN DAVID CAMP I'M YOU HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS AN HOW BIG THE EFFECTS ARE BUT I THINK ONE THING THAT THEY SEEM TO AGREE ON IS GROTH MIND THAIT IS MORE IMPORTANT IN  CIRCUMSTANCIS  WHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO NEED IT I'M SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE I'M KIDS WHO ARE IMPOVERISHED I'M ORE MARGINALIZE COMMUNITIES I'M OU KNOW THE MESSAGE THAT YOU ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT YOU YOU ARE CAPABLE OF I'M YOU KNOW OF EVOLVING YOURE SKILLS TO THE POINT THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE BAD AT TO DAY YOU COULD BE GOOD AT NEXT YEAR I'M IS REALLY IMPORTAN WHEN YOU NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE IM AND WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A SINGLE PERSON BELIEVING IN YOU I THINK WE'RE I'M WE'RE WE'RE OFTEN MISSING THE BOAT IS WE THINK I I'M JUST GET A O'M AN IN STILL THIS IDEA IN A PERSON'S HEAD AND MY WORK AS DONE I'M AND WE KNOW THAF THE CONTECTS AROUND YOU REALLY MATTERS SO I'MACTUALLY CAROL'S DONE SOME RESEARCH SHOWING THAT I GROTH MIND SAT IS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT I WHEN YOU'RE CLASSERIN CULTUR I'M ALSO AND YOUR TEACHER IT HAS THE BELIEF THAT KIDS ARE CAPABLE OF LEARNING AND GROWING I'M THAT YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE STARTING ABILITY IS NOT FIXED IN ANY SUBJECT AND I THINK WE PROBABLY FOR ALL OF US AS INDIVIDUALS WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE THE MICRO ENVIRONMENT THAT WE PUT OURSELVES IN I'M I THINK YOU KNOW THE AS ONE ONE THINKS I THINK YOU' LOT ABOUT LATE LY IS SCAFFOLDING AND THE IDEA THAT YUKNOWHENYOU'RE WHN YOURE TRING TO IMPROVE IT SOMETHING YOU DON'T NEED A A PERMANENT TEACHER NECESSARILY YOU DON'T NEED ONE MENTOUR YOU KNOW GUIDING YOU FOR NINE YEARS WHAT YOU NEED IS IS SOMEBODY WHO CAN GIVE YOU THE TEMPORARY SUPPORT THAT ALLOWS YOU TI TO SCALE TO A NEW HEIGHT JUST LIKE A A SCAFFOLDWOOD ON A BUILDING I'M AND IN LEARNING THEORY BAYSICTLY THE IDEA BEHIND SCAFFOLDING IS WORGANA INITIALLY GIVE YOU THE SUPPORT YOU NEED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND THEN WE'RE IN A SLOWLY REMOVE THE SUPPORT SO THAT YOU LEARNED O TO DO IT ON YOUR OWN AND I THINK THAT THOSE THOSE KINDS OF SCAFFOLDS ARE OFTEN MISSING SO WE CAN STILL THE GROWTH MIND SETLY GOT THATS BELIEF IN MY HEAD BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO I'M TO YOU HVE TO PUT THAT BELIEF INTO ACTION AND THAT'S WHERE AM THAT I GUESS THAT THAT ME IS AND WE HAVE TO GO BEYOND MIND SET WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE PUT PEOPLE INTO CONTECTS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO TO PUT THEIR BELIEFS INTO PRACTICE YOU WERE ASKING ME WET ELSE DO WE NEED TO SUPPORT GROWTH MIND SET AND MAKE IT EFFECTIVE FRAIGHT YE'M AN WE KNO PEOPLE EARN WHAT GROWTH MINES IT IS ATS THE IDEA THAT OU'RE NOT AS GOOD AT SOMETHING YET O CAK TERRIFIC BUT IT'S VERY HARDY IMPLEMENT IN REAL TIME THERE ARE IF TO PRESUME ADDITIONAL TOOLS THAT ONE CAN A BOLSTER THAT GROWTH MINE SET WITH MAKE IT MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE  AND BENEFIT FROM IT YES SO IM JUST INBURG AND AMI RESNESKIN I I STUDY THIS ACTUALLY  WE DID AM WE WERE LOOKING AT GROWTH MINE SET AT WORK AND A JUSTENS AH WELL HE'S THI S TAND FOR UTDER NOG YOU MET HIM YET IAVE NONE BUT BIG PLACE AM YES  TI FINGER YOULL WE ALL KNO AS SOON IF THAT YUA BRILLIANT CREATIVITY RESEARCER AND AMY JUST JOINED US SET AT WARTON AND TA HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT I THINK ABOUT IM IDEAS IM IN THE WAY THAT SHE STUDIED HOW WE CAN SHAPE OUR CONTECTS AND JUST DONE PATH BREAKING WORK THERE AND WE WE WERE INTERESTED IN GROWTH MIND SET AND WE WE DESIGN AN INTERVENTION WHERE PEOPLE COULD LEARN GROWTH MIN SET AT WORK SO WE TAUGHT THEM TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEIR SKILLS WERE MALLEABLE HOW CSTRETCH THEIR KNOWLEDGE INTO NEW AREAS AND WE'VE FOUND THAT TEACHING THEM AT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO BOOST THEIR HAPPINESS OR THEIR PERFORMANCE WELL WE NEEDED ALSO DO WS GIVE THEM A GROWTH MIND SET NOT JUST ABOUT THEMSELVES BUT ALSO ABOUT THEIR JOBS IN OTHER WORDS TO TEACH THEM THAT YOUR JOB AS A SET OF FLEX OF BUILDING BLOCKS THAT YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF TASKS THAT MAKE UP YOUR JOBS SOME OF THOSE ER ARE THINGS TO DO OTHERS OR MIGHT BE INNER ACTIONS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE AND IF YOU BREAK DOWN YOUR YOUR JOB INT ALL THESE TASKS YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME TASKS THAT YOU WANT TO ACCENTUATE AND MAKE A BIGGER PARTIER JOB I THERS THAT YOU WANT TA TRY TO SUBTRACT 'MOTHERS THAT YOU MIGHT SWOP WITH THE COLLEAGUE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IT TURNS OUT THINK THEIR JOBS OR ARE FIXED BY THEIR JOB DESCRIPTIONS BUT IN FACT YOU HAVE A TON OF OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WEN AM M YOTHER SOMETHING'THERE'S A STRENGTH I HAVE BUT I'M NOT USING IT RIGHT NOW IS THEIR WAY WE CAN BRING THAT INTO MY WORK AND SO I'M IN THESE COUPLE EXPERIMENTS WE DID WHEN WE RANOMLY ASSIGNED PEOPLE TO LEARN BOTH THAT THEIR JOBS WERE MVALUABLE AND THAT THEIR SKILLS WERE VALUABLE THEY GOT A SUSTAINABLE BOOSTS TO THEIR HAPPINESS THAT WOULD LASTED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS THERE WAS NO COST TO THEIR PERFORMANCE I MEANING YOU COULD TO RE DESIGN YOUR OWN JOB TO BE MORE ENJOYABLE WITHOUT A WITHOUT A DROP IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS AT TO YOUR WORKPLACE AND I THINK WHAT I I CAME AWAY FROM THAT RESEARCH REALIZING IS IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY WHAT WHAL I CAN GET BETTER I CAN IMPROVE BECAUSE VERY OFTEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOURE YOUR ENVIRONMENT IS LIMITED I GREATLY I CAN GROW BUT I'M STUCKIN A DEAD AND JOB AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO THEIRS IS OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO ITO TO INNOVATE ON THEIR OWN JOB DESCRIPTION AND THEN GROWTH MIN SET CAN BEGIN TO TO HAVE AN IMPACT WEL IT IT SOUNDS A BIT LIKE ADDING A S TO GROWTH GROWTH MIND SET SO 'S NOT GROWTH MIND SET IT'S GROWTH MIND SETS A BECAUSE EARLIER YOU MENTION THAT IN THE CLASSROM ENVIRONMENT IF THE TEACHER ADOPTS A GROWTH MIND SET YES AS WELL AS THE STUDENTS WELL THEN YOU HAVE A CULTURE OF GROWTH MINE SET SO IT'S THE UM INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THIS AND AND THE CONTACT IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUALS GROWTH MINES THAT EXIST TO HAVE THAT RIT WELL PUT YET WE MENDET OF CALLING IT DUEL MIND SET BUT I THINK MAKKING IT A PLURREL IS GED BECAUSE IYETS IT'S NOT I I HAVE THIS IMAGE OF OU KNOW U YOU PUT A PERSON IN A IN A CAGE AND THEN TELL THEM THEY'RE CAPABLE OF GROWING STILL STOCK IN A CAGE AND SO WE NEED A WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO TO BUST THROUGH THOSE WALLS SUPERIMPORTANT I HATE TO TAKE US BACK TO AN EARLIER TOPIC BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I MENTASCU THAT I DIDN'T AN AN ABSOLE NEEDING TO ASK YOU WHICH IS YOUR RECENT WORK OR RECENT ISH WORK AS A FW YEARS BACK NOW AND YOUR SO PROLIFIC THAT I HAVE TO CALL IT A FEW YEARS FACT AM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTRINSIC MOTIVATION AND PERFORMANCE ON OTHER TASKS A YA YA AND THE REASON I ASKD TIS IS SEVERALFOLD AM I DID TWO EPISODES OF THE PODCAST ON DIH AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED IN TALKING TO EXPERTS ON AT HT PEOPLE WITH AD H T AS WELL AS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE NOVEL TREATMENTS EVERYTHING FROM BEHAVIORAL TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG TO EVEN NUTRICIAN BASED WAS THAT KIDS AND ADULTS WITH CLINICALLY DIAGNOST A H T OUR ACTUALLY TERRIFIC PAYING ATTENTION TO THINGS THAT THEY REALLY ENJOY OR THAT THER SUPERINTERESTED IN SO CLEARLY THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY IS JUST THAT THEY HAVE AM DEFICITS F YOU WELL IN ATTENDING TO THINGS THAT ARE LESS EXCITING TO THEM LESS ENTREATING TO THEM SO IF I RECALL CORRECTLY AYOU HAVE PUBLICATION THAT EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTRINSIC MOIVATION AND PERFORMANCE IN OTHER STUFF  AND ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT HAVING A DEEP DEEP INTEREST IN ONE THING MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST A CONDITION FOR PERFORMING WELL AT OTHER LESS INTERESTING TASK COULD YOU AM COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT STUDY WHAT WHAT MOTIVEADED YOU TO CARRY OUT THAT STUDY AND WHAT SOME OF THE MAJOR TAKE AWAYS WERE YES DEFINALLY A YU YOU SUNRISE IT REALLY WELL I THINK A THE THE ORIGINAL YPETIST THAT THIST IS ANOTHER PROJECT WITH Y HASHEN AND A G H CAME TO ME WANTED MONEY TO STUDY ENTRANCE OF MOTIVATION AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT INTRINSICMOTIVATION AND WHAT ARE THE GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE AND ONE THING THAT HAS ALWAYS BOTHERED ME IS WHEN PSYCHOLOGISTS STUDY SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS POSITIVE AND THEY ONLY STUDY THE BENEFITS OF IT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN UNMIDTICATED GOOD RITE ALL ALL A SORT OF ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCES HAVE COSTS ALL UNPL ASANT EXPERIENCES CAN HAVE BENEFITS WE NEEDN' WE NEED TO FILL OUT THIS TO BY TO OF GOOD THING BAD THING A GOOD OUT COME BAD HOUT COM A AND SO I MY CHALLENGE TO HER WAS CAN YOU SHOW ME THE DARK SIDE OF INTERANSTIC MOTIVATION AND SHE CAME BACK AND SHE SAID WHAT IF THERE'S A COST OF LOVING A TASK LEAVING HERE TO HATE A TASK THAT YOU DON'T LIKE EVEN MORE THAN YOU DID BEFOR SI GO THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA TTRACTS WITH A BASIC PSYCHOLOGY OF CONTRASK EFFECTS I WHERE A YOU KNOW IF YOU EAT SOMETHING DELICIOUS THAN YOUR LEAST FAVOURITE FOOD TASTES A LITTLE BUT WORSE AFTERWARD AND SO I LET'S THE STUDY THAT SO I SHOULD HAFE GETTING DATA FROM I FROM PEOPLE AT WORK AND THN WE ALSO DESIGN AN EXPERIMENT ISS SURE ENOUGH I THE THE MORE PASSIONATE YOU ARE AN TASK ONE THE MORE YOUR PERFORMANCE SUFFERS IF TASK TOO IS REALLY BORING AND I GUESS WHAT WHAT THIS DID FOR ME IS IT MADE METHING DIFFERENTLY ABOUT TAST SEQUENCY I USED TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND DO MY MOST INTERESTING TASK FIRST AND THAN THE GRATING WAS HELL AND WHEN I DO NOW IS I START WITH A MODERATELY INTERESTING TASK IT'S A LITTE BIT OF WARM UP FOR ME AND THEN I HAVE AN EXCITING ONE TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND IF I DO HAVE A TASK THAT'S BORING BUT IMPORTANT I THINK THE PERFORMANCES GEN A SUFFER LESE INTERESTING A AND NORMALLY DON'T ASK ABOUT MORNING ROUTINES AND HOW ONE STRUCTURES T DAY BECAUSE IT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL A CLETLY GRE AND AND DEPENDS ON WHETHER NOT PEOPLE OF KIDS AND THERE PATSON WHAT OTHER AH BUT I'LL JUST SHARE WITH YOU A BRIEF ANECTO TO HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A VERY ACCOMPLISHED MUSICIAN AND HAS BEEN FOR FOR SEVERAL DECADES NOW AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAS A PRACTICE OF AFTER HE GETS OFF STAGE AND HE'S LIKE SADIUM STADIUM SELL OUT LEVEL A MUSICIAN A HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME AND SHOWS NO SIGNS OF STOPPING JUST INCREDIBLE BUT A VERY DOWN DEARTH PERSON AM AND HE SAID ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DOES WHEN HE GETS OFF STAGE IS TO GO TO SOME MENIAL TASK I THOUGH THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S TRUE BUT I'VE KNOWN HIS WIFE SINCE COLLEGE AND SHE HE VERIFIED THAT STATEMENT  LIN WHAT WHAT SORTS OF HIS MENIAL TASK YOU TIIE BY HIS I OILIKE CLEANING UP SOME OF THE CANS AND THINGS THAT ARE THERE MADE EVEN CLEANING A TOILET AT A THEN YOU AND I THOUGHT NO CHANCE BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE AND I SAID WHAT'S WHATS THIS ABOUT IS ABOUT HUMILITY SOM WELL MAY BE A LITTLE BIT BUT HE SAID IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT A LOT EASIER FOR HIM TO RETURN HOME AND DEAL WITH THE KIND OF LITTLE THINGS THAT JUST ARE OUT OF SCALE WITH THE EXPERIENCES THAT HE JUST HAD HIS TAPERING I WA UKE I THINK YE YE I I FIRST SAW I WAS SO STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT HE A CREATED THIS PROCESS FOR HIMSELF SO LONG AGO AND HE'S ALSO SOMEBODY WHO'S YOU KNOWIS MAINTAIN IT'S LIKE BEEN THE SAME MARRIAGE FOR EXTREMELY LONG TIME IS HE'S EXTREMELY HAPPY IN THAT HIS FAMILY A IT SEEM WHEN THE FEEL IT SEEMS TO THRIVE AND ALL DOMAINS OF LIFE AND I'M CERTAIN THAT HE STRUGGLES IN SOME DOMAIN OF LIFE BECAUSE EVERYBODY DOES BUT AM IT SOUND TO ME LIKE A VERY UNUSUAL PRACTICE BUT IT SEEMS TO KIND OF RELATE TO THIS THAT YOU KNOW HE HAS THIS THING HE LOVE'S DOING PLAYING MUSIC AND PERFORMING IN PARTICULAR AND HE'S JUST YOU KNOW YOU POINT OL ONE PER CENT AT DOING THAT AM BUTHEN JUST LIKE BRING HIMSELF BACK DOWN TO EARTH BECAUSE SO MUCH OF LIFE IN I PUSHY FAMILY LIFE IS LIKE DEALING WITH THE THE SCHMUTS IN THE INCONVENIENCE OF EVERYDAY LIFE YES IT'S AT IT ACTUALLY SENCS LIKE WHAT HIS DOING AS HE'S RESETTING HIS FRAME OF REFERENCE TO SAY IF YEF I GO RIGHT HOME THEN THE CONTRASTS BETWEEN THIS HIGH OCTAIN EXPERIENCE ON HAVING I'M AN SORT OF MUDDLING THROUGH EVERY DAY LIFE IM IS GOING TO BE EXTREME IF I DO SOMETHING REALLY SMALL THEN I'M FAMILY TIME IS GOING TO SEEM A LOT BIGGER YE SO I REALISE I'M TAKING A BIT OF A LEAP FROM YOUR STUDY ON INTRISIC MOTIVATION IN AND LOW PERFORMANCE IN ANOTHER DOMAINS BUT YOU KNOW TO ME CLEANING UP CLEAN A TOILET IS YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A IT'S BORING FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS  OH AS HE SAI  NOT LOU OUT TO BEN EXCI NO AND AND LISTEN I MEAN E HAD TO DO IT FOR LIVING I WOULD YOURE IGT AND I WOULD TRY AND DO AS WELL AS POSSIBLE N A A BUT A RIGHT SO WELL I FOUND THAT SAY TO BE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK THAT THESE DAYS WE A WE GLORIFY HIGH PERFORMANCE OU VEN CONP PERFORMANCE A SOMETHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT AND WE FORGET THAT A YES OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO ARE ULTRA HIGH PERFORMERS CAN AFFORD TO PAY OTHER PEOPLE TO DO ALL THE OTHER STUFF U I HAVE TO SAY IN KNOWING SOME MULTRA HIGH PERFORMERS AND IN KNOWING SOME PEOPLE IN THE A BILLIONAIRE BRACKET THE OTHERS A HIGH INCIDENTS OF AF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FRANKLY AND  LACK OF SATISFACTION WITH LIFE THAT MAYBE EVEN COMES FROM NOT A HAVING TO DO ANYTHING BESIDES THE THINGS THAT YOU FIND MOST INTRINSICALLY REWARDING A WE ALL THINK THAT OF I IF I COULD I SPEND ALL DAY DOING THE THINGS THAT I FIND MOST INTRINSICALLY REWARDING BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PUSHPOLE WE KNOW THE BRAIN AT WORKS AND PUSHPOLE WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT HAVING SOME EXPERIENCES EACH DAY THAT ARE CON LIKE AH THIS A THING AGAIN DO YOU THNK THAT HEIGHTENS OUR LEVEL OF SATISFACTION FOR THE THINGS WE REALLY ENJOY I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT DIDN'T I THINK AND CONTRAST EFFECTS ARE VERY POWERFUL AND WE KNOW ABN THETHERE'S HALF A CENTURY OF RESEARCH ON HAPPINESS SUGGESTING THAT THE COMPARISONS WE MAKE ARE WHAT MATTER I YEN I THINK I THINK TIM ER E BEEN PROBABLY PUT IT BEST WHEN HE SAID HAPPINESS IS REALITY MIN ESSEXPECTATIONS AND IF YOU ONLY HAVE ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCES YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE RISING INTO PERPETUITY ID SI IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD YOUR REALITY IS YOU WANTED IT TO BE BETTER AND BETTER I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT MONDAYNE EXPERIENCES A MANAGE TO DO FOR US OR MAYBE BETTER WAY TO SAY IT IS ANHE WANTED O BENEFITS OF HONTANE EXPERIENCESS THEY KEEP OUR EXPECTATIONS ON THE GROUND AND ALLOW US TO BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY YOUNOW A TASK THAT WAS MORE INTERESTING THAN WE EXPECTED EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T LOVE IT WHAT YOU THOUGHTS ON A WHAT I CALL MOMENTUM WHICH IS WHEN I HAVE A AN EXPERIENCE I PERTUULY LIKE LIKE WE RECORD A POD CAST AND REALLY EXCITED TO GET OUT INO THE WORLD OR IF I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE THAT I'M LEFT YOU KNOW VERY EXCITED BY AT THE END THAT OFTENTIMES THE ENERGY AGAIN A SASSED WITH THIS CONCEPT OF NURAL ENERGY THE THE ENERGY THAT I GLEAN FROM THAT EXPERIENCE SEEMS TO HAVE CARRY OVER INTO OTHER THINGS YOU KNOW YOM CAN BE MUCH MORE EXCITED IS GO ACROSS THE STREET AND GET A CUP OF COFFEE FEELS LIKE A BIGGER THING THAN ABNORMALLY WOULD A AND I WOULD THINK THAT ONE COULD CON O RIDE THE WAKE OF A OF A PRIOR ACCOMPLISHMENT EVEN A SMALL ACCOMPLISHMENT EACH DAY AND MAKE THE YOU KNOW TIDING UP OR DOING THINGS THAT ONE WOULD ONE LLY FIND MORE BORING LESS BORING IS THAT TRUE THE WAY YOUR DESCRIBING CONTRAST EFFECTS MAKES I SEM LIKE THAT'S MORE OF A CLIFF LIKE THAT THING WAS GREAT AND NOW THIS THING BUT I ALSO HAD TO RIDE HIGH ON I'M SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TWO THREE DAYS AGO MADE EVEN TWO THREE MONTHS AGO IF SO FEELING GOOD EQUATES TO FEELING GOOD WERE FEELING GOOD I EXCENTSUATES THE THE BANSTO THIS IS THE TTENTION BETWEEN CONTRAST AND SPELL OVER AND YOU CAN SEE BOTH UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS I THINK WHERE THIS IS AND THIS IS A BRAN NEW SORT OF I DONTN ANYBODY'S RECONCILE THOSE TWO TWO PERSPECTIVES YET BUT MY HUNCH FROM HAVING WORKED ON THE CONTRAST PART OF IT IS WE FOUND THAT IT WAS ONLY EXTREME INTERESIC METOVATION THAT HAD THE PERFORMANCE COST ON OTHER TASKS SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ENJOYING SOMETHING I IF YOU LIKE IT THAT WILL GIVE YOU A LIFF FOR OTHER TASKS IM BUT IT'S IT'S WHERE THIS IS THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER DONE AND NOW OTHER THINGS SACCOMPARKISON I THAT'S WHERE WE START TO SEE RUNINGTO A PROBLEM I ALSO WONDER I IF THERE'S A DOMAIN SWITCHING A FACT HERE I I THINK YOURE YOU'RE ALLUDING TO THIS I I IRED SOME RESEARCH THAT JUST CAME OUT THIS YEAR SHOWING THAT I'M ONE OF THE BENEFITS WHEN THE SURPRISING BENEFITS OF MORNING WORKOUTS IS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN Y UR JOB I BECAUSE YOU GET THAT SMALL WIND I I ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THIS MORNING AND THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF EFFICACY THAT YOU CAN CARRY OVER INTO YOUR YOUHOW YOUS TO START YOUR WORKDAY I NOT TO SUGGEST IT EVER ONCH HOUD WORK HALF IN THE MORNINGS THM I'M WITH YOU I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD YOU KNOW BOTH WORK AND WORK OUT AT A TIME THAT WORKS FOR THEM BUT I THINK I I THNK THERE'S SOMEHING TO BE SAID FOR I SOMETHING WENT REALLY WELL IN ONE REALM IN MY LIFE AND THAT BOSE MY BELIEF IN MY CAPABILITY TO TACKLE CHALLENGES IN A DIFFERENT REALM WHAT ABOUT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION A YOU WERE A COMPETITIVE DIVER I'M I HAVE TO PRESUME THAT THERE WERE DAYS WHEN YOU HAD LOUSY DIES I MUST AVE BEEN THAT THAT ONE DAY  LIKE EVERY DAT AND THEN YOU YOU LEAVE YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU SHOWER UP DRY OFF HEAD TED INTO THE REST OF YOUR DAY AND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE SHAGMENT AWAY FROM THE YOU N NEGATIVE THOUGHT SPIRALS LIKE SOMETHING WENT REALLY POORLY AND NOW YOU'RE OFTEN TO THE DOMAIN OF LIFE WHERE YOU CAN DOU YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THE THINGS IT REQUIRED TO DO BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME CHALLENGE IN SOME LEARNING INVOLVED HOW DO WE CUT MOATS BETWEEN NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES I THINK  I MEAN THE TED LAST OSTRATEGIES IDEAL BECOME A GOLD FISH TEN SECOND MEMORY THINK YOU DON'T EVEN YOU NIN RECALL THE PRACTICE YOU HAD EARLIER TO DAY I THINK THAT I DON'T ANYBODY WHO CAN DO THAT CONSISTENTLY IAND I THINK THE MORE DISAPPOINTING THE EXPERIENCES THE MORE YOU TEND TO TO DWELL ON IT I THINK I WHEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SAGMENTING NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES I THINK THE PROBABLY THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE LIKED BEST ON THIS AND AS WHEN OWNLY MAY SHUR CAPTURE THIS CLEARLY I'M I BUSILY SO RECERTAON EMOTION REGULATION SAYS THERE THE'RE TWO STRATEGIES THAT TEND TO BE EFFECTIVE ONE IS DISTRACTION THE OTHERS REFERAMING I SO DISTRACTION IS YOU KNOW FIND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL CONSUME YOUR ATTENTION I THAT'S UNRELATED TO THE THING THAT YOU JUST BOMED AT AND THE HOPE IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT FADES INTO THE BACKGROUND REFRAMING IS  LOT OF WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUTA FEW MINUTES AGO WHICH IS OQT LET ME FOQES YOU KNOW NOT ON THE LEVEL OF MY PERFORMANCE BUT THIS SLOPE I MY DIVING COACHERK BEST IHAS A REALLY GREAT SET OF QUESTIONS THAT HE HE ASKS AND OU KNOW I I I REMEMBER I WUD YOU HAD FINISH PRACTICE THIS IS A TERRIBLE DAY I JUST FEEL AKE I'M WORTHLESS AS A DIVER AND NOW DIVING WAS A BIG PART OF MY IDENTITY I'MAN TO LET MY TEAM DOWN NOW AN A BAD TEAMATE TO MY COACH IS WASTING MY HIS TIME AND NOW YOU KNOW I HE COULD AVE BEEN YU OW TRAINING SOMEBODY MUCH BETTER  WHY AM I DOING THIS AN ARIC WOULD ASK DID YOU MAKE YOURSELF BETTER TODAY AND EVEN IF WAS A BAD PRACTICE THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IMPROVED YES OQ AND SOMETIMES THE ANSWER FEELS LIKE NO AND THEN HE WOULD ASK DID YOU MAKE SOMEONE ELSE BETTER TO DAY YE I GAVE A LITTLE TIP TO A TEAMMATE I YOU KNOW I I MADE A JOKE THAT YOU KNOW THAT MADE EVERYBODY LAUGH AND AS I GREAT THEN IT WAS IN E BAD DAY AND I I THINK THIS IS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT GOOD REFRAMING LOOKS LIKE I'M TO SAY OQUET THE GOAL WASN'T TO BE GREAT IT WAS TO BE BETTER THE GOAL WASN'T NECESSARILY JUST TO MAKE MYSELF BETTERS ALSO TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE BETTER IM AND I THINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT SEEMD TO SAG MEANT PRETTY WELL WELL THAT FEED BACK BEAS I THINK WE ALL GET STUFK IN THOSE THOUGHTS SPIRALS AND IMA YAN NOT TO DEMINIZE SMART PHONES BECAUSE THEY ARE WONDERFUL TOOLS BUT I HAVE TO REMEMBER THE TIME I'M FORTY EIGHT YEARS OLD A AS OF TO MORROW AND I HAVE TO REMEMBER A TIME IN WHICH IM NEGATIVE STUFF WAS PROBABLY HAPPENING IN THE BACKGROUND BUT I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT IT BECAUSE NO ONE WAS TEXTING IT TO ME SO I'D FIND OUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN I STILL HAD TIME TO DO OTHER THINGS IN THE MEANTIME I AH THAT SAID I WOULD ALSO GET NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES EARLY IN THE DAY AND THEN CARRY THEM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WHEN NOWDAYS YOU CAN GET A POSITIVE TEX MESSAGES AS OKET WASN'T SO BAD AH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I I DO THINK AS S PROBABLY BECOMING APPARENT ABOUT UM THESE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION ARE OR EITHER BOONS OR DISRUPTIONS TO OUR AR POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY IS CLEAR THAT WERE JUST LIKEING MONBARDED ALL THE TIME SO U'M JUST AS A AS A PRACTICAL QUESTION OH WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR PHONE UM DO YOU SET BOUNDARIES AROUND YOUR PHONE USE WERE THE TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS AND ACTIVITIES AT YOU ENGAGE ON YOUR PHONE I DO SO O EVERYMOT I I THINK EVERONE I NOW HASN'T TO DO THIS I ALGSO HAVE IT TO DON'T LIST AND ON MY TO DOUBT LIST IN CLUDS I DON'T SCRLL ON SOCIAL ME DEA AND I DON'T PICK UP MY PHOUND I PAST NINE PM AND THERE'S THOSE TWO HABITS ARE ENORMOUSLY HALPFUL PRERTICULARLY THE NOT SCROLLING I PICK UP MY PHONE WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO POST OR WHEN I WANT A SEE WHAT THE COMMENTS ARE AND THEN SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING TO LEARN OR OR SOMEBODY THAT I WANT RESPOND TO AND THAT THAT THAT BECOMES A REALLY HEALTHY BOUNDARY BECAUSE I DON'T GETS DOCKIN ONE OF THESE RABIT HOLES WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN TWO HOURS OF CONPI HAND I FEEL LIKE I FEEL LIK COAN WASTEED M TIME WHERE DO YOU POST OR KEEP YOUR TO DO IN YOUR TODONTLIST DO YOU KEEP THEM ON YOUR PHONE NOW IT'S A WORD DOCUMENT ON MY COMPUTER SEE YOU'R STILL AT THE COMPUTER SCREEN QUITE BEDICH YA II FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHERE MOSTS OF Y GOOD THINKING AN WRITING HAPPENS I CARRY SMALL NOTE BOOK AROUND WITH ME NOW AND WRITE THINGS DOWN I JUST CURIOUS I WHAT IT IS YE WELL LIKE ONE OF THOSE YE YEOH I NOT TO TAKE NOTES OF MY PHONE EVER WRIHT YIT IT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC FOR ME I ESPECIALLY WITH WITH VOICE RECOGNITION NOW BECAUSE YOU IT'S HARD TO GO BACK TO THAT IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY FOR ME BUT O'M A BIG BELIEVER IN THESE THESE THINGS THAT BUT FOR THOSE LISTENING AND OUT WATCH I'M HOLDING UP A PEN S I PENCELS WORK TO YOU AND PROBABLY WREND SOME OF THE RESERTS ALSO SHOWING THAT YOU HAVE A BETTER MEMORY FOR INFORMATION WHEN YOU TAKE NOTES BY HAND THAN MY KEEBOARD I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BUT I'M VERY VERY GRATIFIED TO H EAR THAT SI THE AND I SUPPOSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PEN AND YOU DON'T HAVE A PENCIL HANDY THEN YOU NOW BLOOD ALWAYS WORK JUST KITTING I'M JUSTCA DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T MAKE YOURSELF FOR ANYONE ELSE BLIED JUST TO GET AN IDEA DOWN BUT IT IS AMAZING HOW SOMETIMES WE WILL HAVE IDEAS WHILE RUNNING WALKING SHOWERING OUT AND ABOUT AND THEN LATER TRYING RECALL THOSE IDEAS AND ALL RISE THEM DOWN THEY'RE GONE THE GREAT JO STRUMMER FROM THE CLASH TALKED ABOUT THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF CARRYING ROUND A SMALL NOTE BOOK SUCH AS YOU DID BECAUSE HE SAID THAT THE IDEAS FALL DOWN LIKE RAIN AND IF YOU CATCH THEM THERE THERE BUT IF YOU MISS THEM THEY TRULY WON'T BE THERE LATER AND THAT'S THERE' SOMETHING KIND OF ERIE ABOUT THAT LIKE WHY WOULDN'T WE BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THESE POTENTIAL GEMS OF IDEAS RIGT E THE THE GUISERING UP OF THE MIND WE HAD A GUEST ON THE SPOTCAST FOR A SERIES DOCTOR PALCONTI A PSYCHATRIST  AND HE TALKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND I MENTION THE SOL EARLIER BUT A ONE OF THINGS THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME AS HE SAID YOU KNW EVERYONE THINKS THAT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS AND THE FRONTAL QUARTEXT IS THE SUPERCOMPUTER OF THE HUMAN BRAIN SETS CONTACT PLANNING STRAGY SWITCHING ET CETERA ET CETERA CERTAINLY I IT'S VALUABLE REAL ESTATE TO OUR INTELLECT AND A ALL OUR ABILITIES BUT HE SAID YOU KNOW THE THE REAL SUPERCOMPUTER IS THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND HOWEVER THAT UNCONSCIOUS MIND THAT LIVES BELOW THE SURFACE OF OUR AWARINESS IS ALSO WHAT DRIVES A LOT OF OUR UNCONSCIOUS DEFENCES SO ARE SO CALLED BLIND SPOTS PROJECTION PROJECTIVE IDENTIFICATION YOU KNOW MIN THESE HAVE THESE CAN BE BOTH GOOD OR BAD THEY CAN SERVE US WELL OR OR POORLY AANSON AND SO FORTH BUT IMPLIED IN THIS NOTION OF THE UNCONSCIOUS AND BLIND SPOTS IS THAT WE CAN'T BECOME AWARE OF THINGS UNLESS WE EITHER DO DEDICATED WORK TO BECOME AWARE OF THEM OR EVEN BETTER WOULD BE DEDICATED WORK WHERE WE ARE ASKING OTHER PEOPLE TO SAY HEY LISTEN YOU HAVE A BLIND SPOT AND IT IS BLANK BLAND COMBLIND SO TELL US EM ABOUT THE ROLL OF BLIND SPOTS MABEVEN SOME POSITIVE ASPECTS OF HAVING BLIND SPOTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE CAN DO TO FILL IN THOSE BLIND SPOTS AND AND I PERHAPS ALSO EXPLAIN HOW HOW THEY CAN LIMIT US AND OVEN EXAMPLES THAT IM FROM THE RESEARCH WERE  PEOPLE OVERCOMING THEIR BLIND SPOTS AS BEN BENEFITED THEM TAT WOULD BE AMAZEMEN YA WY THERE'S A LOT THERE LEME BETLET ME TARP IT SAYING I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK ABOUT BLIND SPOTS AND TERMS OF HURISIX AND BIASIS SO YOU THINK ABOUT CONFIRMATION BIAS YOU THINK ABA THE THE CLASSIC CONAMENT TVERSKY WORK I THAT ENDERED UP WAN AINT TANNIAN KNO ABOUT PRIZE ON I YO EW THAT THE WAY IN WHICH IM WE ARE INTUITIVE JUDGMENTS I'M OFTEN GET ANCHORED IN THE WAY WE'VE DONE THINGS BEFORE I'M OR YOU KNOW WE FOCAS ON THE INFORMATION THAT SALLIAN INAVAILABLE TO US AN OVERLOOK  LESS OBVIOUS INFORMATION I'VE COME TO THINK THAT THAT THE MOTHER OF ALL BIASES IS I WHAT IE WHAT I THINK OF IS THAT I'M NOT BIAS BIAS IT'S IT SECONDLY CALLED THE IASBLINE SPOT AND EMILY PROWNIN AND COLLEAGUES RESEARCH BUT THE IDEA IS THAT I THINK I'M MORE OBJECTIVE THAN OTHER PEOPLE AND YOU MAY HAVE YOURE YOU MAY HAVE PLAWS IN YOU'RE THINKING ANDREW BUT ME IKE I I SEY THINGS CLEARLY AND RATIONALLY AND I THINK THAT THIS IS IT'S A REALLY DANGEROUS MATA BIAS BECAUSE THE MOMENT YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT BIAS YOU ARE ININCAPABLE OF SEEING ANY OF YOUR BIASIS I'M SO IN SOME OF THE RESEARCHS ON THE BASBLINE SPOT YOU SEE THAT IM THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE IM WHO SCOR HIGH IN COGNIVABILITYS AS SO ME HIAU ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO FALL VICTIM TO THAT I'M NOT BIASBAS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN REINFORCED FOR A LIFETIME THAT THEY'RE REALLY SMART IAND THEY'RE GOOD TO THINKING GOODNESS THIS EXPLAIN SOME I WE DON'T TALK ABOUT CURRN EVENTS ON THIS PACKAS MUTCH BY THIS EXPLAIN SOME CURN EVENTS AT PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TOLD THEIR ENTIRE CREERS THAT THEY ARE PERFECT OR NEAR PERFECT AND IM I GE CIRCUMSTANCES EVENTUALLY CAME TO YOUL SLAM THEM HARD INTO THE CONCRETE ON THAT ONE OR OR IN SOME CASES IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET BUT WE WE WATCH THEM HURTLING TOWARD EARTH I'M SO I I WORRY A LOT ABOUT THAT SO I THINK THE BEGINNING OF YOU KNOW OF SEEING ANY BLINDSPOT IS RECOGNIZING TAT WE ALL AT BLIND SPOTS PART OF BEING HUMAN I I THINK THAT THE BRIGHTER SIDE OF THAT IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST BLIND TO WEAKNESSES WERE ALSO BLIND TO OUR STRENGTHS I SO JANE DUTTON AND LAURA MORGAN ROBERTS AND COLLEAGUES ITID SOME RESEARCH ON THE REFLECTED BEST SELF PORTRAITS ONE O MY FAVORITE EXERCISES TO DO IN THE CLASSROOM BUT ALSO TO DO IN WORK PLACES SOMETIMES EVEN PEOPLE N U DOING IT WITH THEIR KIDS AT HOME THE IDEAS THAT YOU DO HAVE STRENGTS THAT YOU'RE NOT THAT AWARE OF THEY MAY BE THINGS THAT COME NATURALLY TO YOU THAT YOU DON'T EVE REALIZE ARE HARD FOR OTHER PEOPLE THEY MAY BE THINGS THAT ARE STRUGGLES FOR YOU IAND SO YOU YOU THINK IT'S HOARD TO DO AND THERE FORE I'N THAT AT IT BUT OTHER PEOPLE WAT YOU DO IT AND REALIZE YOU'R ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD AT IT SO THE YOU NED OTHER PEOPLE TO HOLD UP A MIRROR TO SEE WHAT TYEUS INVISIBLE STRENGTHS ARE SO THE WAY THE REFLECT TO BEST SELF EXERCISE WORKS IS YOU'R ASKED TO CONTACT TEND TO TWENTY PEOPLE WHO KNOW YOU WELL IN DIFERENT WALKS OF LIFE MIGHT FAMILY MEMBER COUPLE FRIENDS COLLEAGUES AND THAND YOU ASK THEM TO TELL A STORY ABOUT A TIME WHEN YOU WERE AT YOUR BEST AND YOU COLLECT THESE STORIES IT'S IT'S THE MOST EXCITING WEEK OF EMALE YOU WILL EVER GET TWENTY NOTS LET ME TELL YOU HOW GREAT YOU ARE BUT WHATS KEE THIS GOES BACK TO OUR DISCUSSION OF FEBACK EARLIER IS THE'RE REALLY SPECIFIC ABOUT A MOMENT WHEN YOUWERE AT YOUR BEST AND THEN YOUR JOB IS TO COLLECT ALL THE STORIES AND DO THE PATTERN RECOGNITION EXERCISE AND ASK WHAT OF THE COMMON THEMES THAT I'VE SEEN THROUGH THESE STORIES AND IT'S A IT'S A REALLY POWERFUL AND VIVID WAY OF OF GETTING A SENSE OF WHAT ARE THOSE STRANGTHS AND I YET IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT IN SOME OF THE RESEARCH WHEN PEOPLE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS THEY END UP WITH MUCH MORE CLARITY NOT ONLY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE GOOD AT AND WERE THEIR POTENTIAL LIZE BUT ALSO HOW DO I WHAT OFE THOSE SITUATIONS HAVENIN COMMON WHERE I WAS ABLE TO USE MY STRENGTHS AND HOW DO I GET MYSELF IN THOSE SITUATIONS MORE OFTEN HOW DO I CREATE THOSE SITUATIONS MORE OFTEN I I'LL I'LL GIVE YOUR PERSONAL EXAMPLE ON THIS SO I I GOT A BUNCH OF FEED BACK THAT I WAS GOOD AT HELPING OTHER PEOPLE SEE THEIR STRENGTHS AND I THOUGHT O QUET I DON'T FEELIKE HAVE ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THAT STRENGTH IN MY DAILY LIFE SO WHAT AM IT GING TO DO ABOUT THERS AND HANDED UP FLIPPING THE EXERCISE OF SET OUT ANDI PICKED A HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO I'M REALLY MATTER TO ME AND I WROTE A STORIES TO EACH OF THEM ABOUT A TIME WHEN THEY WERE AT THEIR BES AND THERE'SN' IT THERE'S NO REASON I CAN'T I CAN'T MAKE THIS PART OF MY DAY IM IT'S PROBABLY IT WAS ITWAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST WEEKS IN MY LIFE IM IT WAS BETTER THAN GETTING THE STORIES WAS WAS GIVING THEM AND I GOT THESE NOTES BACK FROM PEOPLE SAYING I I DIDN'T REALIZE I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THING THAT HAPPENED IM BUT I THINK FOR ME WAS AN EXAMPLE OF SAYING O K I'M OKNOW I'VE I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED I'M TRYING TO BRING OUT THE BEST IN OTHERS I DON'T FEEL LIKE AT THE TIME I WAS A I WAS A FIRST YEAR DOCTRAL SUDENT I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAD ANYTHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO OTHERS YTRY T I'M TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO YOU KN UNDERSTAND THIS FIELD AND YOU KNOW DO A WORTH WHILE STUDY AND WRITE A PAPER I'M NOT TEACHING YET I HAVE NO VALUE TO ADD AND GETTING THIS FEET BACK OH YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO HELPS OTHER PEOPLE SEE THEIR POTENTIAL RIGHT LET ME LET ME TAKE SOME PEOPLE THAT I UOI ALREADY RECOGNIZE I'M REALLY AMAZING THINGS IN AND LET ME JUST TELL THEM THAT IAND I TOOK ME ABOUT A WEEK TO WRITE THE THE HUNDRED YMELLS AND I'M I CAN'T THINK OF A A WEEK I'VE SPENT BETTER SO INTERESTING A YOU FLIPPED THE PROCESS ON ITS HEAD A BIT UM WERE A LOT AND THAT AND IT UP BEING THE REWARD DO YOU THINK YOU LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT GIVEN THAT IT WAS EARLY IN YOUR ECADEMIC CAREER DO YOU THINK YOU I'M LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR I PARTICULAR TALENT OR DESIRE TO TO DO WHAT YOU DO NOW I MEAN IT SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AS SEEMS TO MAPPED WELT WHAT YOU DO NOW I'M YET YOU COULD BE I IF YOU WERE TO CHOOSE WERE CHOSEN A JUST NOT JUST BUT A LABORATORY SCIENTIST DOING EXPERIMENTS OM Y U'RE CLEARLY STILL DOING THAT AT T BUT WITH A TREMENDOUS PRODUCTIVITY BUT YOU'VE ALSO DECIDE TO TELL THE WORLD ABOUT THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE GATHERING AND THE WORK OF A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S WHILE I GES UP FEUEL I CAN SHIP HERE BECAUSE WE BOTH DO THIS I'M MUCH MORE MUCH MORE INTERESTING ASITE OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK THE TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU AREADY KNOW IT IS INDEED I'M AND IT'S FUN TO BE ABLE TO TO WEVE ONE'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS AND TO YOU KNOW WHAT LI WHAT ARE OTHER PEOPLE DOING AND KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO DO REALLY GOOD EXPERIMENTS AND I'M THE ABLE TO SPOT REALLY GOOD EXPERIMENTS BUT YET DID YOU LEARN IN THAT EARLY I'M STAGE OF YOUR CAREER THAT I THINK I WANT TO DO THIS LATER BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO NOW IS IT MAPS PRETTY WELL ONTO WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED I I DON'T THNK IT WAS I I WASN'T CRYSTALLIZED AT THE TIME BUT I WAS CESSFULLY ONE OF THOSE SEEDS THAT WAS PLANTED THAT THEY MUST HAVE GROWN BECAUSE I I REMEMBER WRITE AFTER I GOT TENER I  WONDERFUL COLLIGAMINE ASKED IF I WOULD WRITE A BOOK WITH HIM I WAS SO FLATTERED AND I WENT INTO TO TALK TO MY UNDERGRAD RESEARCH LAB LATER THAT DAY AND I YOU I MENTIONED OFF HAND AND YEI GOT THIS INVITE HIM AN WITE THIS BOOK AND THEY FREAKED OUT NO YOU CAN NOT WRITE SOMEBODY ELSE'S BOOK YOU HAVE TO WRITE ABOUT YOUR IDEAS FIRST IF YOU'RE GON O WRITE A BOOK WRITE YOUR OWN BOOK AND I I I WAS VERY RESISTANT BECAUSE I LOVE OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS NO I W I I FEEL LIKE WHAT I DO BEST I'M I THINK IT WAS I S BOYER WHO WROTE ABOUT THE SCHOLARSHIP OF DISCHOVERY VERSES THE SCHOLARSHIP OF INTEGRATION AND I NEVER FELT LIKE I WAS A EUREKA YOU KNOW BLINDINGLY YOU KNOW ORIGINAL INSIGHT PERSON I FELT LIKE WHAT I WAS GOOD AT WAS SYMTHASIZING IDEAS I'M AND YOU KNOW KIND OF TAKING A BUNCH OF IM BEU NO PIECES OF CLOTH AND AND SEWING THEM INTO A QUILT AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO SEE THE BIG PICTURE IN A WAY THEY HADN'T BEFORE AN I FELT LIKE I COULD DO THAT WITH A COLLEAGU WHO WAS ALREADY A SUCCESSFUL AUTHOR AM I SOON SPASICALLY HELD ME HOSTAGE SAID YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS RESEARCH FOR FOR OVER A DECATE NOW AND YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SHARE THAT OUTSIDE YOUR CLASSERO AND IT REMINDED ME OF OF THAT EXPERIENCE OF SAYING O CAVE THERE'S SOMETHING I SEE AND OTHER PEOPLE I WANT TO SHARE IT WITH THEM A AND MAYBE I COULD DO THAT ON A BROADER SCALE SO YET I THINK THERE WAS THERE WERE DEFINITELY DOTS THAT CONNECTED THERE WHEN I WAS A A MASTER SOON AT BERKELEY THERE WAS A I WHOS NOW MOVED A MICHIGAN STATE MARK BREED LOVE WHO I HOPE TO HOST ON THE PADCAST ACTUALLY AS REALLY INTEREST DOES REALLY INTERESTING WORK ON THE BILGY OF SEXUAL DEFERENTIATION AND AM I THINK THAT'S AN INVITE IF YOUR LESTN E I AH AND HE A IT IS INDEED AND HE SAID TO ME HE SAID YOU KNOW REVIEW ARTICLES PROVIDED THEY ARE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO A ARE CREDENTIALED AN A GIVEN FIELD ARE SITED AT YOU KNOW A HUNDRED ACTS ANY ONE PARTICULAR PAPER NOW AT THE TIME I WASN'T INTERESTED IN A  IMPACT FACTORS IN FACT I'VE NEVER PAID ANY ATTENTION IN PACT FACTORS THEY'VE THEIR IMPORTANCE VARIES AN IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND AM IN THE OUASS TE THE PUT PLACE SOM ROLL A MORE SO IN EUROPE BUT I I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT IN PACT FACTOR FRANKLY AM BECAUSE OFWAS THOSE METRICS ARE WHAT IT'S GOING TO CARRY YOU THROUGH THE DIFFICULTY OF DESIGNING AND CARRYING OUT A HARD EXPERIMENT YOU HAVE TO BE INTRINSICALLY AND CURIOUS ABOUT THE ANSWER RIGHT YOU KNOW THIS AND I KNOW THIS BUT A BUT HE BASELY SAID A WHAT A SOMETHING AS REALLY SUPPORTS YOUR POINT A WHICH IS THAT ULTIMATELY THE ABILITY O SYNTHESIZED INFORMATION IS CAN FEEL A REALLY GOOD AND HE START TING AOUT THAT THAT THE FEELING THAT HE GOT FROM DOING THAT HE'S ALSO A TREMENDOUS SPEND SCIENTISTS AS WELL IN ANY EVENT AM I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU FLIPPED THAT EXERCISE ON ITS HEAD BECAUSE NOW THE WORLD GETS TO BENEFIT FROM YOU DOING THAT FOR US ALL THE TIME BECAUSE I I REALIZE NOW THAT MUCH OF WHAT YOU DO IS TO HELP A PEOPLE IDENTIFY IN ERACE THEIR BLIND SPOTS BY AM AND I LOVE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIO CHANNELS AM AND I NOTED  ON INSTRGRAM AND I DO SCROLL BUT BUT I SCROLL THROUGH AND TO YOUR OUR CHANNEL TO UM KNOW YOU'LL PUT UP IN SHORT FORM CONTENT THAT THAT REALLY HIGH LIGHTS THE KEE IMPORTANCE OF PEOPLE EMBARKING ON STRATEGIES THAT THEY WOULDN'T REFLECTIVELY TAKE THAT I SEE THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S LIKE WE THINK THAT THE BEST LEADERS DO BLANK BUT ACTUALLY THE RESEARCH SAS THEY DO EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE AND AND YOU HAVE A A VAST AM IT OF THOSE SO LONG THOSE LINES KNOW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST COMMON BLIND SPOTS THAT UM YOU OBSERVE AAND THAT PEOPLE COULD BENEFIT FROM UNDERSTANDING AND AND UM DOING CONTRARY ACTION AAROUND AS IT RELATES TO LET'S A INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS IN THE WORK PLACE OR AT HOME AND ND D MAYBE WE COULD UM SEE THIS WITH A FINDING THAT YOU'VE ALSO WRITTEN ABOUT WHICH IS THAT A MENO PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN EXERT A LOT OF PROFICIENCY AND EVEN CONTROL IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL LIFE WILL SOMETIMES BRING THAT TO THEIR RELATIONSHIP LIFE AND THAT DOESN'T WORK RIT THE IDEA THAT LIKE BEING IN CHARGE IN BEING CONFIDENT AS A GREAT IS A GREAT SET OF ATTRIBUTES AM BUT IT CAN REALLY FAIL US IN OTHER DOMAINS I CAN WE WEAVE THAT IN WITH BLIND SPOTS HE WE CAN SO I THINK THAT SO WA ONE OF THINKS I I FOUND OF THE PASSFER YEARS IS THAT AND THIS IS INSPIRED BY A A PELTATLOCK FRAMEWARK IM A LOT OF A SPEND A LOT OF OUR TIME THINKING LIKE PREACHERS PROSECUTORS OR POLITICIANS PREACHERS PROSECUTORS POLITICIANS YES SO YOU THINK BETHEWS IS AS THREE MENTAL MODES THAT EVEN IF YOU NEVER WORKED IN ANY OF THESE CAREERS YOU YOU WILL WATCH YOUR THINKING COLORED BY AT LEAST ONE OF THEM MORE OFTEN THAN YOU WOULD LIKE SO IN PREACHER MODE YOUR BASICALLY PROSOLATIZING YOUR OWN VIUWSE AND YOU AV ENTER YOUR  IN SOME IN SOB SUGGETIONS I THINK OF YOU AS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL DEBUNKER OF PREACHERS OF YOU KNOW A CERTAIN KINDS OF SNAKE OIL WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH A AND YOU KNOW AND BIOLOGY AM SOMETIMES YOU TAKE THAT TOO FAR AND PEOPLE MIGHT ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A PROSECUTOR AWHERE YOU'R ATTACKING OTHER PEOPLE'S VUWSE MAN AN THE THIRD MODE POLITICIAN MOTIS IS BASICALLY YOU KNOW HIM BOTHER TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE UNLESS THEY AREATY AGREE WITH YOUR VIEWS WHAT WHAT I THINK I IS INTERESTING AS THESE THESE MODES OF THINKING ARE ADAPTIVE FOR IN IN CERTAIN ROLLS I'M SO PREACHERS MAKE GREAT SAILES PEOPLE THEY'RE OFTEN VISIONARY LEADERS I PROSECUTORS ARE OFTEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE SCIENTISTS AND WE EXCEL IT CRITICIZING OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK AND FINDING WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT IM POLITICIANS ARE GREAT AT CURRYING FAVOR THEY DO A LOT LOBBYING THEY WIN APPROVAL THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALL OF THESE MODES STOP YOU FROM QUESTIONING YOUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS OF BELIEFS I'M SO MY I I'LL TAKE MY BIGGEST VICE AS PROSECUTOR MODE I'VE BEEN CALLED A LOGIC BULLY MY WIFE HAD TO EXPLAIN TO ME THAT WAS NOT A COMPLIMENT ONLY IN THI EV II KNOW I KNOW YOU'VE EXPERIENCES TOO IF FI FI FI FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEIR STRONG EVIDENCE THAT SOMEBODY IS WRONG I BELIEVE IT'S MY MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO CORRECT THEM AND THAT NEVER GOES WELL AMAZING UM I WON'T REFLECT ON MY OWN ES AL JO SAY YES AN YES A WRITE  WRITE THAT THE UM LOGIC WORD NINGYA MODE UM IS ONE THAT I THINK WE'RE TRAINED IN AS ECANEMICS WE AREN' THAT AND YOU KNOW OR IF YOUR LAWYER OR YOU KNOW OR  MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS AS WELL  AND I THINK IT HOLDS VALUE AND IT CAN BE VERY FACTIVE IN CERTAIN DOMAINS BUT I'M LESS EFFECTIVE ANOTHER DEMN YES AND I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW WHEN I UD ACTUALLY WETHER YOU'RE PREACHING PROSECUTING OUR POLITICANG ASSUME YOUR POLITICING YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE NOT OPEN BECAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY IN ALL CASES YOU THINK YOU'RE RIGHT AN OTHER PEOPLE ARE WRONG AND SO THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO TO REASON WITH YOU TO DISAGREE THOUGHTFULLY WITH YOU SO MY FAVORITE ALTERNATIVE AND AND THIS IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING I AND FOR FUN IS THINKING LIKE A SCIENTIST AND WHEN I SAYTHINKING LIKE A SCIENTISTS I DO NOT MEAN THT UNION TO BUY A MICROSCOPE OR INVEST IN A TELESCOPE WHAT I MEAN IS S AS YOU MODEL SO FACTICALLY A GOOD SCIENTISTS HAS THE HUMILITY TO KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW AND THE CURIOSITY TO CONSTANTLY SEE CAT NOU KNOWLEDGE THERE'E BEEN MULTIBLE EXPERIMENTS SHOWING THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT TO THINK LIKE SCIENTISTS THEIR JUDGMENT IMPROVES AND SO TO THEIR DECISIONS AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT STEMS FROM IWHEN WHEN YOU GO INTO SCIENTISTS MODE YOU REALIZE THAT ALL OF YOUR OPINIONS ARE JUST HYPOTHESES WAITINGTO BE TESTED ALL OF YOUR DECISIONS ARE EXPERIMENTS AND SO II'M NOT TRYING TO PROVE THAT I'M RIGHT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT IF I MIGHT BE WRONG AND THEN IF I FIND OUT I AM WRONG IS EASIER TO PIVIT AND INSTEAD OF BEING REALLY INVESTED IN BEING RIGHT I CAN TRY TO GET IT RIGHT IAND I THINK IN SOME WAYS THAT'S THE THAT'S THE META MESSAGE THAT I'M TRYING TO COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE WITH MY WORK IS IASSUMPTIONS ARE MEANT TO BE PRESSURE TESTED THEY'RE MEANT TO BE QUESTIONED AND CHALLENGE AND IF YOU'RE NOT OPEN TO RETHINKING YOUR VIEWS IMTHEN YOU BASICALLY TURNED THINKING INTO A RELIGION AND I NO ABOUT YOU BUT I PREFER TO HISMY FUSS I I'M GOOD DATA IMAS SUPPOSE TO BLIND FAITH IAND I THINK THAT'S BEEN A HUGE PART OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION IN THE LAST THREE OR SO YEARS TO PUBLIC DISCOURSE IS IM YOU'VE YOU'VE HELP PEOPLE THINK MORE SCIENTIFICALLY AND TALK MORE SCIENTIFICALLY ABOUT THEIR DAILY HABITS AND BEHAVIORS THAN IMI GUESS MY MY BE QUESTION IS HOW TO WE HELP PEOPLE DO THAT MORE OFTEN EVEN IN NOMANS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND THY DON'T READ JOURNALS PERSUELT THA THANKS FOR THE KIND WORDS OF FEE BACK I THINK YOU MIGHT MY GOLLS ALWAYS TO YOU IDENTIFY WHOSE COMING THE POCAS FOR HEALTH TOOLS AND PROTOCALS AND HEALTFULLY TEACH THEM SOME SCIENCE AN SCIENTIFIC THINKING AND FOR THOSE THAY ARE COMING TO THE POCASTS FOR SCIENCE AND SCINTIFIC THINKING HEALPFULLY THEY GET SOME HEALTH TOOLS AND PROTOCALS ALSO BUT I'M THESE I FELL IN LOVE WITH SCIENCE FOR THE EXACT REASON THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHICH IS THAT I I LIVED I GREW UP IN A FAMILY THAT WAS VERY DIVIDED POLITICALLY ALONG RELIGIOUS LINES ALONG ASSENTIALY EVERY LINE LIKE WHAT FOODS TO EAT WHAT WAS HEALTHY WHAT WAS AND AND THE ONLY WAY I COULD RECONCILE IM THESE VERY FRANKLY POLERIZE VIEWS WAS TO YOU KNOW IM BARK ON THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD POSE A HYPOTHESIS AND THEN TRY AND DISPROVE ONE'S HYPOTHESIS AND SOME THINGS GET THROUGH THE FILTER AND IT'S A CONSTANT LEARNING SO UM I SHOULD JST ASK WHEN YOU TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO BE A SCIENTIST IN ORDER TO A TRYIN TO OVERCOME SOME OF THEIR BLIND SPOTS BE BETTER THINKERS BETTER MEANING IT SERVES THEMSELVES AND THE PEOPLE ROUND THEM BETTER A IS THAT TEACHING THEM WHAT A HYPOTHESISIS THAT HAPOTH A HYPOTHESIS IS NOT A QUESTION IT'S A SORT OF A UM YOUR YOU WAGER ON AN IDEA WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG AND THEN YOU TRY AND DISPROVE THAT IDEA IS THAT THAT SORT OF THE CROX OF OF WHAT A IN THESE EXPERIMENTS IS AM YOU'RE DESCRIBING AS TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO BE SCIENTISTS YET IF THEY JUST DO THAT THEN THEY'LL THEY'RE GOING TO BENEFIT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S OF THE VERY HEART OF THE LANDS IS AV OUT ED JUST DOUBLEA CLICK ON THE IDEA OF DISAPPROVING YOURE HYPOTHESIS OTHER PEOPLE LIVE IN AE LAND OF CONFIRMATION BY US WHERTHER THEY'RE VASICALLY JUST LOOKING FOR SUPPORT FOR THEIR PRE EXISTING BELIEFS THAT'S RIHT THEIR CLICK FORGIND WE ALL DO THIS BY THE WAY I'M NOT CRITICIZING HERE WE ALL WILL HAVE AN IDEA AND THEN WE WILL CLICK FOR AGE ON LINE TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT WE DISAGREE WITH THEM THEY DIDDISAGREE WITH US AH HERE SOMEBODY IAGREE WITH AND THAT AGREES WITH ME I THINK AND DO YOU THINK THIS AS ROOTS IN OUR UM YOU KNOW IN THE NORL CIRCUIT UNDERPINNINGS OF A VAM JUST WANTING TO HAVE A FILIATION THAT A FILIATION FEELS GOOD YYEN HAVING PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE US KNOWING THAT WE'RE NPROTECTED IN THAT IYET I THINK THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT THINK ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WE IN CASE OURSELVES AN ECHO CHAMBERS AND A HID AN FILTER BUBBLES IS ITHERE'S THERE'S A STRONG EVOLUTIONARY PRESSURE TO AVOID SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND SO YOU KNO I'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU NATE BEING DRAWN TO A FILIATION IT'S ALSO A I I REALLY WANT I'M AFRAID AF BEING EXCOMMUNICATED FROM MY GROUP AND IF I CHALLENGE THE ORTHODOXY OF THE COMMUNITY THAT I BELONG TO I MIGHT BE AN OUTCAST  I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK EVERY DAY PEOPLE THINK THROUGH THAT LOGIC BUT I THINKERS I THERE'S A DEEP SEATED  VISEROUGH TENENCY TO AVOID THAT AND I THINK THE WHEN WE THNK ABOUT TEACHING PEOPLE TO SEE THEIR BLIND SPOTS MORE CLEARLY I'M A LOT OF THAT IS IS RECOGNIZING IT'S HARD TO DO THAT ON YOUR OWN I BECAUSE BY DEFINITION YOUR BLIND SPOTS ARE INVISIBLE TO YOU AND SO THIS IS WHY OTHER PEOPLE'S AN PUT IS SO IMPORTANT AND I THINK YOU KNOW I I KNOW THIS MAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE UN COMFORTABLE BUT I THINK EVERYBODY ON SOCIAL MEDIS SHOULD FOLLOW PEOPLE THATHEY DISAGREE WITH BUT NOT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT YOU WANT PEOPLE WHO REACH DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS FROM YOU BUT WHERE YOU RESPECT THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS THOSE THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY STRETCH ER THINKING AND I THINK THAT'SWHAT WE ARE TRAINE TO DO I THIT'S WHAT I WAS TRAIN IT IS A SOCIAL SCIENCE SOCIAL SCIENCISTS IS TO LISTEN TO THE IDEAS THAT MADE ME THINK HARD NOT JUST THE ONES THAT MADE ME FEEL GOOD AND TO SURROUND MYSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO CHALLEGE MY THOUGHT PROCESS NOT JUST THE ONE WHO VALIDATED MY CONCLUSIONS I THINK YOU KNOV LOT OFPEOPLE HERE THAT MESSAGE NO BUT I DO'T WAN TO LET THAT LIKE THAT AWFUL PERSPECTIVE IN THE MY WORLD I NO YOU WANT TO BE MORE NEWONCE IN SAYING WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHERE BEFORE I KNEW WHAT THEIR ANSWER WAS I WOULD BE IMPRESSED WITH THE DEPTH AND THE THOROUGHNESS OF THEIR REFLECTION AND THEIR ANALYSIS I SHOULD BE FOLLOWING THOSE PEOPLE AND LEARNING FROM THEM REGARDLESS OF THE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THEY GENERATE AND THE RESULTS THAT THEY SHARE I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU MENTION THE AM IMPORTANCE OF FOLLOWING PEOPLE THE DISAGREE WITH I THINK ONE THING THAT WE HAVE TO HI LIKE AND A'M HOPING WILL MAY BE EVEN EMERGE FROM THIS CONVERSATION IS THAT FOLLOWS ARE NOT INDORSEMENTS AND THIS IS OUR SHEER REAL PROBLEM IN THERE ARE ACADEMICS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS NOT NSURELY FOR FOLLOWING CERTAIN ACCOUNTS BUT FOR M COMMENTING ON CERTAIN COMMON THREADS MAY BE EN ALIKE AS IT IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFEREN CATEGORY BECAUSE IT'S AS THE NAME SUGGEST IT'S ALIKE AS THAT  IT SOUNDS LIKE AND IT'S THOUGHT OF AS A VOTE OF APPROVAL OF WHAT'S THERE YE BUT WHEN ONE'S OPTIO NS ARE JUST UM YOU KNOW A HEART A A FOLLOW OR NO HEART NO FOLLOW UM NOW I WAS A BIG VAN OF THE THUMBS UP THUMBS DOWN I DON LIKE THE THUMBS UP THUMBS DOWN BECAUSE AT LEAST YOU HAVE TH THAT YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO TO UM TO DESSENT IM WITHOUT GETTING INTO UN ON A COMMENT BATTLES AND THINGS THAT SORT BUT IM LISTEN I I'VE HAD UM PEOPLE ASK ME WHY DO YOU FOLLOW SO AND SO BECAUSE FOLLOWS ARE ALSO SING AS A SIGN OF SUPPORT BECAUSE I'RE ADDOMING ADDING FOLLOWERS AND PRESUME LY IN THE ALGRYTHM RAISING PROMINENCE TO A CHANNEL YET I'M RIGHT THEY'RE WITH YOU I FOLLOW LOTS OF ACCOUNTS UM OF PEOPLE WHO I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH BUT I'M TRYING TO LEARN AND I'M ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THEY'RE CAPTURE POINT ARE LIKE WHAT LIKE WHY PEOPLE FIND THEM SO INTRIGUEING YES UM AN WAY I'M I'M A LEARNER I'M A FORIGER LIKE YOU SO I'M IN THE SAME BOAT AND EVERY WOT'S A WHILE I THINK IT IT'S DUNNING TO ME I DO'T NOW IF YOU'VE EVER LOOKED AT YOUR YOU'R INSIGRAM STATISTICS I BUT SOMT I SOMEBODY I I CALL YOU MINHT ACTUALLY SHOWED MEI DID I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU COULD LOOK AT THE EFFECT OF EACH POST IN FOLLOWS AND UNFOLLOWS I DIDN'T REALISE A AND YOU KNOW THAT I THINK IT MY TYPICAL RATIO MIGHT BE TWO OR THREE TO ONE FORIPOST SO YOUON GAINING TWO OR THREE TO FOUGHT WHAT TWO OR THREE FOLLOWS T EVERY ONE THAT I LOSE THE IDEA THAT I COULD POST ANYTHING THAT WOULD CAUSE SOME ONE TO UNFOLLOW ME IF I SAID SOMETHING INTERESTING ENOUGH THAT YOU THOUGHT I WAS WORTH FOLLOWING HOW COULD HOW COULD ONE POST CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THAT I THINK YOU'RE TWO FOCUSED ON WHAT I THINK AND MAYBE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW I THINK I WAS MY MY FIRST REACTION TO THAT AND MY SACOND IS MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS WELL MAYBE MAYBE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS PEOPLE SHOW UP AND THEY DON'T REALIZE THE FOUNDATION OF EVIDENCE BEHIND THE TOTAL BODY OF WORK AND SO ONE POST YOU HAVE STRIKES THEM WRONG AND THEY THINK THIS PERSON IS NOT CREDIBLE OR THEY THINK THAT THIS PERSON HAS I YOU KNOW LOST SIGHT OF YOU KNOW OF WHAT W RIGOROUS SCIENCE IS I WONDER IF YOU YOU HADE THAT EXPERIENCE TO OF I I THINK I I MAKE THE MISTAKE OF TAKING FOR GRANTED THAT ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWED ME KNOWS THAT IF I POSET SOMETHING I THINK IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BAN CAREFULLY STUDIED AND I DIDN'T HAVE A YOU KNOW I DID'T HAVE A DOG IN THE FIGHT I READ THIS RESEARCH AND SAID THITS CLEARED THE BAR NOT ONLY OF AN ACTATOVE JOURNAL BUT I READ THE METHODS AND I FOUND THEM SOUND ENOUGH THAT WE OUGH TO BE DISCUSSING THIS IDEA HAVE YOU HAD THAT EXPERIENCE TO UM I CERTAINLY HAVE AND I SHOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW I WAS WEANED IN AN ACADEMIC CULTURE THREE SEPARATE MENTORS VERY DIFFERENT STYLES ALL OF WHOM UM WE'RE EXCELLENT MENTORS BUT ALL OF WHOM TAUGHT ME THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE PHENOMENAL PAPERS WHERE TH EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION IN THE PAPER AND INDEED HOW IT'S WRITTEN FROM START TO FINISH IS JUST WATER TIGHT AND INCREDIBLE AND THERE ARE OTHER PAPERS THAT ARE LESS WATER TIGHT BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE WILL BE PAPERS WHERE ONE DATA POINT IN A FIGURE IS INTRIGUING ENOUGH TO CONSIDER FOLLOWING THAT CEN TRAIL IN YOUR OWN WORK EVEN IF THE REST OF THE PAPER IS CIN EH I MET ONE DATA POINT NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN TAKING ONE DAY TO POINT IN CASTING IT OUT TO MILLINGS OF PEOPLE ON SULCIAMEDIS AN ACTIONABLE ITEM IS IS IS VALID THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHEN I'M DONG BUT WHAT I DO REALIZE IND AND A'M REALIZING AGAIN NOW FOR WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS THAT INDEED PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE CONTEXT NER WHICH LIKE LIKE WHAT FILTERS ARE WE WORKING WITH BEFORE WE BRING THINGS FORWARD AND I THINK THAT U'M YOU KNOW MY BELIEF IS THAT IF IT'S GROUNDED FIRMLY IN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD THAT UM THAT'S THE BEST STARTING PLACE RE TIME UT THAT EARLIER AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTISTS DIFFER TREMENDOUSLY AND HOW THEY LOOK AT EVEN THE SAME DATA IN THE SAME PAPER SO THERE IS NO GOVERNING BODY THAT SAYS O GA THIS PAPER MEANS BLANK THE AUTHORS HAVE THEIR INTERPRETATION THE STUDENTS HAVE THEIR INTERPRETATION IN FACT THE COURSE I USE TO O TEACH UM T UNDERGRADUATES WHICH GREW INTO A VERY LARGE COURSE WE WOULD LEARN TO ASK FOUR QUESTIONS WHAT'S THE QUESTION THAT THE AUTHORS WERE ASKING SOMETIMES THE SUB QUESTION WHAT METHODS DO THEY USE WHAT DID THEY FIND AD THEN WHAT DID THEY CONCLUDE AND DOES IT RELATE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION AND THATS SIMPLE UM BREAKING OUT OF FOUR QUESTIONS OF SAYS THIS SUNTUARLY WHAT I DO FOR ALL STUDIES AM BUT IAVE MY WAY OF DOING IT AND HOWING TO DIFFER FROM THE WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE DO IT A SOCIAL MEDIA A I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT I THIN THERE'S ALWAYS GOING T BE A CORPS FOLLOWING OF OF A GIVEN PERSON LIKE YOUR YOUR FALLERS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRUST YOU'R NOT SOTY CROSS THE BOARD WITHER THERE'S A GENERAL ACCEPTANCE OF IDEAS COMING THROUGH I THINK THAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S HARD TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN SETTING THE WHOLE CONTEXT AND THE ACTION WILL TAKE WAYS I GET CRITICIZED A LOT FROR NOT BEING CONCISE ENOUGH AND I AGREE BUT A BUT I ALSO GET NO ONE DECIDO PUTTING THINGS AT A TAKING THINGS OUT OF CONTECT YES SO A THAT'S A TIGHT REPLITS A TIGHT WROTE WALK AND IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TIGHT WROTE WALK AND SO OMONAGEST YOU KNOW KEEP GOING  AND I KNOW YOU WILL TOO AM AND AND LISTEN I  THERE'S THER SUM KIDS OUT THERE SURELY NOT CAN BE OND THAT THET ARE OING TO TAKE OUR JOBS EVENTUALLY AND UM AND WE'LL FIND A WAY DO IT MUCH BETTER WHO KNOWS THROUGH A I I E RE AT A I BE REAL BOTS AM IF YU LIKE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO ASK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE INC E WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOR PERCEPTION OF A OF OTHERS AND IN GLEANING INFORMATION OVERCOMING BLIND SPOTS IS SOMETHING YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT  SOME YEARS AGO NOW I GUES ITWOULD BE ALMOST HE EARS OGO NOW AM ABOUT AUTHENTICITY UM YOU KNOW THE WORD AUTHENTICITY IS IS SUCH A MIN FIELD IT SUCH A MIND FEEL I WAS GOING TO SAY SUCH IT HAS SUCH A GRAVITATE POSITIVE GRAVITATIONAL PULL LIKE OH THERE REALLY AUTHENTIC I SUPPOSE TO WHAT'S THE OPOBSA AUTHENTIC PHATIC RIGHT BUT UM I THINK WE COULD ALL LEARN TO DRAW SOME LINES BETWEEN AUTHENTICITY AND OVERSHARING RIGHT WHOW DO WE GAUGE AUTHENTICITY AND WE CAN REFER PEOPLE TO THAT ARTICLE YOU WROTE SOME YEARS AGO I THINK A YOU MAY HAVE WRITTEN IT DIFFERENTLY WHERE TOD BE OT WRITTEN TODAY YOU TALKIN AN HAD ARTICLE ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO ESSENTIALLY DECIDED TO TELL EVERYONE THAT HE WORKED WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN AM A DOING WITH THEM RELATING TO THEM AND IT DID NOT SERVE HIM WELL YES THAT'S AUTHOR O THEM RIGHT AND SO THEN THERE'S THIS UM THIS NOTION OF BENEVOLENT DECEPTION IN ORDER TO PRESERVE RELATIONSHIP AND INPORTANTLY UM IT BROUGHT ABOUT A WORD THAT WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT VERY OFTEN BUT THAT I I RATHER LIKE WHICH IS ETIQUETTE LIKE THERE'S SOPOR SOCIAL MEDIA BY THE WAY I APPLY CLASSROOM RULES I'LL TOLERATE ANY COMMONT IN THE COMMENT SECTION BUT NOT THE SORT OF COMMENT THAT I WOULDN'T TOLERATE IN A CLASSROOM YOU START INSULTING OTHER BECAN INSALT ME BUT IF YOU WANT TO INSULT OTHER PEOPLE I'M NOT CAN TA TOLERATE THAT SO UM THAT'S WHERE DRAWLINE CLASSROOM RULES THERE'S AN ETIQUETTE AND I THINK THAT UM ETIQUETTE IS IMPORTANT SO HOW DO WE BALANCE AUTHENTICITY WITH ETIQUETTE AND ALSO WITH PRESERVING ONES A A ONE'S PUBLIC LIFE OR PRIVATE OR PRIVATE LIFE YI AUTHENTICITY AT HOME SEEMS IMPORTANT YU TO BE YOUR COMPLETE SELF AT HOME EXCEPT WHEN YOU WANT A YOU KNOW PHYSICALLY IT YOUR SISTER OR BROTHER BECAUSE THEY YOUR ICE CREAM THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT KIND OF AUTHENTICITY NOW NOW IT ISN'T I THINK WELL THE I THINK IT SUCH A WRICH  AND COMPLICATED TOPIC I THINK FOR THE FIRST THING IS I I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE DISINGENUOUS EVER BUT I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE SAYING AS AN EXCUSE FOR DISRESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WELL I WAS JUST BEING MYSELF  I THINK DAVID SADER SAS YES BUT YOURSELF IS AN ASSAL SO GO SO I THINK I THINK WHAT PEOPLE FORGET IS THAT WE HAVE WE ALL OF MULTIBLE SELVES  YOU YOU YET M YOU YOU'VE KNOWN THIS YOUR WHOLE CAREER I WE ALL HAVE MULTIPLE IDENTITIES WE ALSO CAN THINK ABOUT YOURSELF AS YOUR THOUGHTS YOUR EMOTIONS I YOURE VALUES YOUR PERSONALITY SO WICH FACIT OF YOURSELF OR YOU TRYING TO BE TRUE TO II WOULD ARGUE THAT AUTHENTICITY WITHOUT BOUNDARIES IS CARELESS AUTHENTICITY WITHOUT AMPATHY IS SELFISH AND PART OF BEING AUTHENTIC IS CARRYING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S VALUES THAT SHOULD BE ONE OF YOUR VALUES SO WHAT THAT MEANS CONCRETELY IS I DON'T THNK WE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT BEING AUTHENTIC TO WHAT WE'RE THINKING AND FEELING IN ANY GIVEN MOMENT I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO ASK IS WHAT AM ABOUT TO DO OR SAY CONSISTENT WITH MY PRINCIPLES AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS YOU WILL BE FALSE TO YOUR PERSONALITY IN ORDER TO BE TRUE TO YOUR VALUES SOMETIMES THAT MEANS YOU WILL YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT HONORING YOU'R THOUGHT ARE YOUR EMOTION IN THE MOMENT BUT YOU'RE DOING THAT WITH A BROADER VIEW TOWARD WHO IS THE PERSON THAT I WANT TO BE THERE AS A CULTURAL CRITIC LINEALD TRILLING WHO WROTE ABOUT THE IDEA OF SINCERITY IS OPPOSED TO AUTHENTICITY AND I REALLY LIKE THIS DISTINCTION HE SAID WHEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TRY TO THINK ABOUT BEING AUTHENTIC YOURE TRYING TO BRING THE INSIDE OUT AND TRO POINT ENTRY THAT'S NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE OR EFFECTIVE HE SIN SINCERITY IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT BRINGING THE OUTSIDE IN SO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PERSON YOU CLAIM TO BE AND THEN TRY TO BECOME THAT PERSON AND THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN AHOMAMENT FORME I REALIZE YO OTHER THERRE ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL YOU SHOULD YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD WALK YOUR TALK AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD ADVICE I MIGHT EVEN GO A STEP FURTHER AND SAY YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU SHOULD ONLY TALK IT IF YOU'RE ALREADY WALKING MAYBE MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP US AVOID HYPOCRISY BUT I THINK THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL MESSAGE HERES THAT WE WE AUGHT WE WE ALL COULD BE AUTHENTIC TO ONE PART OF OURSELVES AND IN AUTHENTIC TO ANOTHER PART AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS TO ASK WHAT DO I STAND FOR AND IF I'M WHAT AM ABOUT TO COMMUNICATE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THAT TAND MAYBE MAYBE I COULD SELF CENSOR SUCH GREATED VICE AN DOM SUPPOSE A ONE HAS TO WONDER ABOUT THE THE ROLE OF A EMOTIONAL STATES YOU KNOW I THINK  THE'RE CAREER ENDING MISTAKES THAT PEOPLE MAKE IN A MOMENT I'M ESPECIALLY ON LINE NOWADAYS AND BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN THEIR CAREER I'AVE HEARD STORIES AND THERE SEEM TO BE MORE MORE OF THESE IN THE NEWS OF OF FRINCE A UNIVIDIOS OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE SAID SOME YEARS EARLIER GETTING THEM EJECTED FROM COLLEGE AM A GUEST ON LIKES FREEDMAN'S PODCAS WHO WORKS IN THE SECURITY'S WORLD SAID THAT ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT HE TEACHES IS KIDS AS DO NOT FILM THEMSELVES DOING BAD THINGS BUT IN AND OF COURSE ALSO NOT TO DO BAD THINGS BUT IN GENERAL TO JUST NOT FILM THEMSELVES DOING ANYTHING BECAUSE OF HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISK OF OF DOING THAT AND WE DO'T WANT TO CREATE A PARONOISA BUT AM GOSH I MEAN WHOYOU ARE WHEN YOUARE FOURTEEN IS A VERY DIFFRENT PERSON THAN WHO YOU ARE WHEN YOUARE TWENTY SEVEN  WHEN YOUARE FIFTY OP SO A HOPE SO ESO O YOU KNOW AND AUM IS SO I THINK IT YOU NO BALANCING AUTHENTICITY ACROSS THE LAST PAN AND WERE EXPECTING YOUNG MINDS TO DO THIS AND CLEARLY OLDER MINDS CAN'T DO IT EITHER I MEAY NOT I THIS IS A PRETTY WELL NOWN CASE OF A CHAIRA BUT MAJOR PSY THE MAJOR PSYCHIATRY DEPARTMENT AM WE WON'T NAME THE UNIVERSITY BUT AM BASELY LOST HIS JOB FOR A SINGLE TREAT HE JUST WAS NOT BEING THOUGHTFUL IN FACT HE WAS BEING A REALLY AM LIKE NUM TO TO OTHER PEOPLE AND LOSS HIS JOB ANDAND I THINK HE PI DON'T KNOW HIM AM UT AND IT WAS OBVIOUS WHY HE LOST OENTHING H WAS DEBATABLE BUT AM GOSHYO THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO IS A CHAIR OF PSYCHATRY WHICH MEANS THEIR PSYCHIATRIST WHICH MEANS THEIR TRAIN TO THINK ABOUT THINKING AND THERE YOU GO IT'S A MASING HOW COMMON MISSES AND I THINK WHAT THINGS IS FASCINATE TO ME HIS I GUES IS IS GOES BACK TO IS AMIN VER TIME ABOUT A MOMENT AGO BUT I I THINK THAT WHEN WHEN WE COMMUNICATE WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE SUM TOTAL OF OL OF OUR THOUGHTS AND EVERYTHING WE EVER EVER SAID THAT WE CAN REMEMBER AND WE FORGET THAT OTHER PEOPLE ON THEY HAVE A SNAP SHOT IT'SO ONE F THE QUESTIONS I I LIKE TO ASK IS IF THIS WAS THE ONLY POST THAT SOMEBODY SAW OF MINE WOUTD E BE PROUD OF IT WOUT IT COMMUNICATE WHO I AM AND WHO I ASSPIRE TO BE SO GOOD THE ANSWER IS NOW MAYBE I SHOULD PAUSE BEFORE I PUT THAT OUT THERE THAT THAT IS EXCELLENT ADVICE IF YIU WERE THE ONLY POST LIKE YOUR ONE AND ONLY REPRESENTING YOU  FANTAIS THAT NOW THAT COULD BE PARALYZING IF YOU ARE PRIDECTONIST YOU'LL NEVER POST BU I THINK FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S POSTING REGULARLY IM IT'S A GOOD FILTER TO JUST ASK I'M AM I  I BEING THOUGHTFUL ENOUGH SO GOOD I WON'T HADD ANYTHING TO THAT JUST A I'LL JUST SAY SO SO GOOD LET'S TALK ABOUT POTENTIAL I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND I REMEMBER HAVING A SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER WHO A SHEJUST WOULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT POTENTIAL SHE AT SPECIAL PROGRAMME AFTER SCHOOL YOU COULD CAN VALE POTENTIAL POTENTIAL POTENTIAL IM AND WE HEAR ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW WE HAVE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL YOU HEAR WE'RE ONLY OPERATING AT FORTY PER CENT OF OUR ABILITIES YOU NON'T PEOPLE SAY THAT IM THE IMPLICATION IS THAT WE HAVE RESERVOARS OF POTENTIAL THAT WE'RE JUST NOT ACCESSING BECAUS WE'RE NOT DOING THE RIGHT THINGS THINKING THE RIGHT THINGS IM I KNOW YOU'E NOW RESEARCH THIS TOPIC EXTENSIVELY IVE A NEW BOOK ON THIS TOPIC IM TELL US ABOUT POTENTIAL WA DO WE ALL HAVE HUGE RESERVOIRS OF POTENIAL THAT WE ARE NOT ACCESSING AND OF COURSE I AND EVERYONE ELSE ONCE KNOW HOW CAN WE ACCESS THOSE BUT MAYBE COULD ALSO TELL SOME OF THE MYTHS AROUND POTENTIAL AND AN TELL US ABOUT ILS ABOUT POTENTIAL SUCH AT SUCH A A STICKY TOPIC FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS THINK I I YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WHERE YOU'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE I'M SURE MANY TIMES WHERE YOU START THINKING AND TALKING ABOUT A TOPIC AND YOU REALIZE IT'S IT'S BEEN YOUR WHOLE LIFE BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE IT UNTIL THEN I FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT POTENTIAL I THINK THAT I'VE BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR POTENTIAL AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER I THINK EVERY EVERY GOAL I'VE EVER SET HASN'T BEEN ABOUT STRETCHING MY POTENTIAL IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I'M OR AT LEAST REALIZING IT AND WHET I'VE BECOME SO STRUCK BY AS I'VE STUDY THIS TOPIC IS WE ALL HAVE HID IN POTENTIAL BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO UNLOCK IT SO WHY DO WE OFTEN UNDER ESTIMATE OUR OWN POTENTIAL WE JUDGE OURSELVES BY US BY OUR STARTING ABILITIES IAND THIS IS MORE COMMON FOR PEOPLE WITH FIX MINE SETS BUT EVEN PEOPLE WITH GROWTH MONE SETS I' YOU TRY A NEW SKILL IT DOESN'T GO WELL AND YOU THINK THIS IS NOT FOR ME I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS I'M AND THEN IT GETS WORSE WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ALSO YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT JUST UNDER ESTIMATING YOURSELF YOU'R ALSO BEING UNDER ET UNDER ESTIMATED BY OTHERS OTHER PEOPLE WATCH YOU AND SAY YE YOU DON'T HAVE THE YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT A PRODID I'M YOU'RE NOT A NATURAL YOU DON'T HAVE THE TALENT THAT IT TAKES AND I THINK THE BIG MITH THERE IS THAT A RO TALEN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVER OF HOW HIGH PEOPLE CLIMB IIT'S NOT MOTIVATION AN OPPORTUNITY MATTER MORE THAN RO ABILITY FOR GROWTH MOTIVATION AND OPPORTUNITY YE IM OU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU EVERYBODY STARTS AT A DIFFERENT POINT I'MBUT HOW CLOSE YOU COME TO YOUR POTENTIAL IS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE CHARACTER SKILLS YOU CULTIVATE I'M TO TO IMPROVE AN IMPROVING OVER TIME AND THEN WHETHER YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOUKNOW YOU YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU NEED AND THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO KEEP GROWING AND SO YEI  CONCRET EXAMPLE THIS FOR ME IS IM WHEN I WHEN I STARTE DIVING I WAS WAY TOO LATE I PICKED IT UP IS HA TEA NATURE A LOT OF THE LY DIVERS IN THE WORLD START BY FIVE GOODNESS AND ACTUALLY IN CHINA THEIRES THEIR HANDPICKED BY FOR BODY TYPE AND SENT TO AVERSION OF DIVING BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE THEY NON EVEN TEACH KITS HOW TO SWIM I THEY TIE ROPE AROUND THEM SO THAT THEY CAN JUST PULL THEM BACK AFTER AFTER THEY THEY HIT THE WATER IN THE DEPENT WILL PARTHER BYHE TI ROPERO II THINK IT'S THEIR WASTE SO THEY DIVING WITH A ROPE SO THAT WHEN THEY GEN THE WATER THEYRE NOT WASTING ANY ENERGY EXACTLY YOU'RE JUST BEING DRAGGED THROUGH THE WATER AND O THAT'S A IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT I'M WELL BUT BRIZL OI GI THEY HAVE TO WALK THEY AV TO CLIMB YE ECAUSE THE MUNCH OTHER THINGS HAPPENED THAT THA THE SWIMMING APPARENTLY IS VERY SECOND THERE ANYWAY I'M SO I STARRED REALLY LATE AND I LACKED MOST OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD WANT AS A DIVER I'M I I COULDN'T TOUCH MY TOES WITHOUT PENNY MANIES MY TEAMATES CALLED ME FRANKINSTINE BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF WHEN I WALKED ISO LACKING THE FLEXIBILITY I HAVE NO RHYTHM MY COACH PROUGHT A METRONOM TO PRACTICE ONE DAY AND I COULDN'T EVEN KEEP THE BEAT AH SO YOU KOW YOU THINK ABOUT DIVING AS A SPORT OF GRACE NO AND THEN I ELSO COULDN'T JUMP AND I COULDN'T TWIST EITHER AND SLIKE YOU'RE MISSING THE EXCLOSIVE POWER YOU DON'T HAVE THE THE ATHLETICISM I'M AND I THINK IF I HAD IF IHAD JUST LOOKED AT THOSE ABILITIES AND NO BUSINESS BEING A DIVER AND IN FACT NO BUSINESS BEING ATHLET I'D ALREADY BEEN CUT FROM THE MIDDLE SCHOL BASCEBALL TEAM THREE TIMES I DIDN'T MAKE THE HIGHSCHOOL SOCRATEME THOSE WITH TWO SPORTS I'D POURED A DECATE INTO THAT THIS IS GOING NOWHERE I'M ERIC JUST THE MOST INCREDIBLE COACH I CAN EVER IMAGINE HE SAID TO ME ON THE FIRST SDAY OF PRACTICE HE SAID I'M YOU KNOW YES YOU'RE MISSING ALL THESE THINGS BUT I BELIEVE IF YOU IF YOU POUR YOURSELF INTO THES SPORT THAT YOU CAN BE A STATE FINALIST BY THE TIME YOU FINISH HIGH SCHOOL AND HE SAW MORE POTENTIAL IN ME THAN I SAW IN MYSELF AND THAT JUST LIT A FIRE UNDER ME AND I'M YOU KNOW WHAT THAT TRANSLATED INTO IS A LOT OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT THAT YOU AND I BOTH STUDIED IM YOU KNOW SETTING SPECIFIC DIFFICULT GOOLS FOR I WANT TO LEARN TESE DIVES THAT SEEM OUT TO REACH I'M FOR YOU KNOW I WNT INCREASE MY SCORE OVER THE NEXT THREE MEATS BY TEN POINTS I'M FOR I WANT O LEARN HOW TO YOU KNOW ALL MY LIMITATIONS NOT WITHSTANDING ONE THING THAT I CAN MASTER T I'VE TOL CONTROL OVER IS HOW CLEAN I GOINTO THE WATER I CAN GET A REPENTRY SO THAT THERE'S NO SPLSH AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A DIVE AND ONE OF THE GREATEST COMPLIMENTS EFERCOT AS A DIVER WAS I CAME OUT OF A MEAT IN AM AS COUPLE YOURS AND I THINK IAS MAY BE A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I ONE O THE JUDGES TURNED TO ERIC AND SAID ALL HE CAN DO IS RIP AND ERIC SAID SO YES IT'S ALSO IT'S ALMOST LIKE SAYING ALL HE CAN DO AS WIN YE KNOW ITDIS IT WAS A GREAT BACKHEADED COMPLIMENT BUT ERIC WAS LIKE LISTEN HE MADE THE DIVE IT HAS A DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY MAY BE HE DIDN'T JUMP AS HIGH AS HE WANTED MAYBE HIS TIPTE HIS TOCK WASN'T AS TIGHT AS HE WANTED I BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT DIVE DISAPPEARED STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN INTO THE WATER YOU CAN'T NOT GIVE THAT A SEVEN IAND TAT DIN'T OBSERVING ME REALLY WELL AND SO THINK THAT THE BROUDER LESSON HERE FOR ME WAS ERIC SAID TO ME I'M ACTUALLY LAST YEAR I I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS HE SAID I I NEVER GOT CLOSE TO EVEN QUAIFYING FOR A LIPIC TRIALS I I DID NOT HAVE THE TALENT TO TO BE THAT GUD BUT GOT WAY BETTER THAN I EVER EXPECTED AND I ERIC SAID TO ME HE SAID LOOKING BACK I HE SAID YOU GOT FURTHER WITH LESS TALENT THAN EVERY  ANY DIVER OF EVERCOACHED AND THAT WAS SO MEANINGFUL TO ME AN WHEN IT REMINDED ME WAS I MY PRIDEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE NOT IN THE AREAS WHERE I STARTED OUT WITH THE MOST TALENT THEY WERE IN THE AREAS WHERE I HAD OVERCOME THE MOST OBSTACLES AND I THINK THAT TO ME IS I'M REALLY WET DRIVES PEOPLE AROUND POTENTIAL IS TO SAY IM IT'S NOT PERFORMANCE THAT'S MOTE OF ATING IT'S A SENSE OF PROGRESS I LOE THAT STORY AND I AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I'MAN I THINK UM OR KNOWS MY FAVORITE TOPIC IN SCIENCES THE COURSE I PERFORMED AT LEAST AFTER MY FRESHMEN YERE WHICH WAS ABYSMAL AM LEAST WELL IN THE FACE WHEN I WAS DOING WELL I' MA CLASS WITH IT IS NERAL DEVELOPMENT I NOW TEACH NERAL DEELLAI WAT NERAL DEVELOPMENT I BAD WERE YOU AT IT AT FIR I O GET WELL I HAVE TO PUT IN CONTACT  MY HIGH SCHOOL AND FRESHWHEN YOUR CALLEGE WERE WERE ABYSMAL I I BASELY NO PLACE BEING THERE I CAN ONLY THINK MY SCHOOL GIRL FRIEND FOR A BEING SO WONDERFUL THAT I FOLLOWED HER OFF TO COLLEGE AND ENDED UP THERE AM LEFT AFTER MY FRESH EMOR CAME BACK AND THEN AT THAT POINT IT WAS LIKE A STAP FUNCTION I WORKED OUT OF FEAR AND EXCITEMENT AND LOVE OF THE MATERIAL AM I WAS A STRAIT A STUDENT THEREAFTER BUT IN MY SENIOR SENIORYOR SCUSE ME I TOOK A COURSE IN NERAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING A AND I GOT A BEE PLUS AND THAT BEE PLUS STILL GETS ME YOU KNOW BUT IT'S A TOPIC THAT I LOVE THE MOST IT'S WHAT I DID MY A GRADULATE THESISANCE WHAT I TEACHED A AT STANDFORD AMONG OTHER TOPICS AND A ANILECT TO THING NOW I HAVE AGAINST HUMILITIASIDE CONSIDERABLE MASTERY OVER OVER THE THE MATERIAL BUT IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO AS WELL AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED AND I APPLIED MYSELF SO MUCH AND I THINK THAT IT JUST DIDN'T COME NATURALLY TO ME AND THEN YOU VENTUALY OVERTIME YOU YOU CANTOT GET IT WER YOU GET UM YOU GET IT A SO IT'S IT BUT IT'S STILL MY FAVORITE TOPIC BECAUSE IT WAS THAT FRICTION POINT RIGHT IT'S THE RACHTING THROUGH AND THERE'S SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST SO INTRINSICALLY SATISFYING TO ME I USED TO WATCH MY BULL DOG MASTIF COSTELLO LIKE CHEWING ON A BONE OR WHEN HE WAS  ON A BRICK CAUS YOU KNOW HE HAD A KIND OF A HOMER SIMPSON BRAIN ABOUT HIS OBJECT CHOICE TO CHEW ON AND WIT AND HE JUST LOOKD LIKE HE WAS IN JUST TOTAL BLISS IT WAS LIKE THIS EFFORT AM COMBINED WITH SOME INTRINSIC PLENSURE OF THE PROCESS AND SO I THINK THAT WHEN ONE IS RACHETING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S HARD IT FEELS SO GOOD THAT IS ALMOST BETTER THAN THE OUTCOME LIKE IT IT IT IS BETTER THAN THE OUTCOME I THINK IT IS AND YET'S IT'S FASCINATID BECAUSE THIS IS WHY I'M ALWAYS BOTHERED BY PEOPLE SAYING PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS BECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT YOU WILL GRAVITATE TOWARD THE THINGS THAT COME NATURALLY TO YOU AND YOURE GING TO MISS OUT ON VERY OFTEN THAT THE SKILL THAT WAS HARD FOR YOU TO LEARN TO YOUR POINT IS ONE THT YOU END UP WITH GREATER NATURAY OVER BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PUT IN THE EXTRA EFFORT AND YOU END UP DERIVING MORE MORE SATISFACTION I THE FACT THAT YOU MIGT THIS WAS REALLY TOUGH AND I FIGURED IT OUT I'M YOU KNOW IMPLICIT IN YOUR STORY IM AND MAY BE PARTIALLY EXPLICIT AN IN SOME PARTS IM WHEN I WAS WHEN IS L GET THE CHARACTER SCALES THAT HELP PEOPLE REALIZE THEIR POTENTIAL I'M AND REALLY FUEL UNEXPECTED GROWTH I'M I INDENT A FINDING THREE THAT I I THINK IR UNDER DISGUST AND I'M AN WELL SUPPORTED BY SCIENCE I'M I THINK THAT AT BASICALLY IF YOU WANT TO REACH YOUR POTENTIAL OR I'M YOU KNOW IT SHE MORE THAN YOU THNKYOU'RE CAPABLE OF WE'RE LOOKING AT BECOMING A CREATURE OF DISCOMFORT I'M AND EMBRACING THINGS THAT ARE UNPLEASANT OR AWKWARD FOR YOU ITHEY'LL BE THE FIRST THING THE SECOND IS I'M IS BEING A SPONGE AND SOAKING UP KNEW INFORMATION AND ALSO FILTING HER FILS I FILTERING OUT WHAT MIGHT NOT BE USEFUL AND THEN THE THIRD IS IM IS BEING AN IMPERFECTIONIST WHICH IS KNOWING WHEN TO AIM FOR EXCELLENCE AND WHEN TO SETTLE FOR GOOD AND I I HEAR ALL OF THOSE THEMES IN YOUR STORY I I YOU KNONT THAT WAS OBVFULLY OBVIOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE YOUYOU GOT TO BE PLUSSEDYOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANY MORE NORL DEVELOPMENT OOO IT WAS IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING AND SO EXCITING TO ME AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN I WENT EVERYTHING I DID IN THE FIVE OR SEVEN YEARS THAT FOLLOWED WAS ALL ABOUT LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS TOPIC ECAUSE AI DIT WASN'T ABOUT PERFORMING WELL OR PROVING MYSELF I JUST I I LOVED THE MATERIAL SO MUCH MORE BECAUSE OF HOW CHALLENGING IT WAS AND I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU BEN REESES  PROFESSOR YOU SEE SANA BARBARA INCREDIBLE NHER ANATAMIST AND TEACHER OF NERAL DEVELOPMENT AND AN LABORATORY SCIENTISTS BECAUSE IM YOU KNOW I THINK HAD I GOTTEN IN AN A I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVED WITH IT IN THE SAME WAY ISN'T THAT WEIRD YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO WORK AT IT TO DISCOVER WHAT WAS FUN ABOUT IT I IMAGINE N ABSOLUTELY AND IT STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOPICS TO TEACH I AND LEARN ABOUT SO YOU MENTIONED DISCOMFORT BEING A SPONGE SLASH FILTER IF I GOT THAT RIGHT AND AN IMPERFECTIONIST IM YET TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE IMPERFECTIONIST PIECE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IM I'VE HAD STUDENTS IN MY LAB AND I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE ANOTHER DOMAINS LIFE THAT THERE THERE ABSOLUTE PARONOID ABOUT SHIPPING SOMETHING OUT FOR YOUT WORLD TO SEE IT AND OF COURSE LIKE NO ONE WANTS TO PUT STUFF OUT INTO THE WORLD THAT ISN'T RIGHT IN GOT FR BY COULD BE WRONG BUT IM OR THAT'S GOING TO EMBARRESS US SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE PERFECTIONISTS BUT I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE THE  THE EXTREME PERFECTIONISTLY HATY EVER DO ANYTHING AND AN NEVER THY  HAPPY PEOPLE CAUSE I CAN TOMSH NO I EAS TO THOMAS KUR AND I THINK AS THE WORLD'S LADEST LEADING PSYCHOLOGIST STUDYING PERFECTIONISM AND IF YOU LOOK AT HIS MEDANALYSIES A PERFECTIONISM IS A RECIPE FOR BURN OUT AND DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY BECAUSE YOU'RE CONSTANTLY COMPARING YOURSELF TO AN IDEAL THAT'S ON ACHIEVABLE IM PERFECTION IS IM ARE NOT THEY DO GET BETTER GRADES IN SCHOOL SLIGHTLY BUT THEY DON'T DO ANY BETTER AT WORK THEN THERE APPEARS BECAUSE I THINK IN SCHOOL YOU HAVE A PREDICTABLE OUTCOME YOU HAVE A GENERAL SENSE OF WHAT'S TO BE ON A TEST AND IF YOU STUDY HARD ENOUGH YOU CAN COME CLOSER TO THE APLUS WHEREAS AT WORK PERFORMANCEIS MUCH MORE NEBULIS AND SO IT HAPPENS TO PERFECTIONISTS A LOT OF TIMES IS THEY END UP I'M OPTIMIZING THE THINGS THAT ARE PREDICTABLE AND CONTROLLABLE AND MAN YOU KNOW SORT OF MISSING THE FORESTS IN THE TREES AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE ANTIDOTES I AS FAR AS I KNOW REALLY HAVE TO TO DO WITH CALIBRATION SO OU KNIGT I TALKED EARLIER ABOUT IM HOW I LIKE TO ASK FOR IZERO TO TEN TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW I'M I AM THE BALPARKER NOT WELL WON'T BY BIGGEST LIABILITIES AS A DIVER WAS I WAS NEVER TSATISFIED WITH MY SCORE AND ONE DAY AIR SAID TO ME YOU KNOW YOU YOU HEAR LYMPIC JUDGES TALK ABOUT OUR COMMENTATORS TALK ABOUT THE PERFECT TEN THAT'S A MISSNOMER IIF YOU LOK THE DIVING RULE BOOK A TENIS FOR EXCELLENCE NOT FOR PERFECTION THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FLAWLESSTIVE I CAN LOOK AT DIVES THT HAVE GOTTEN STRAIGHT TENS AND POINT OUT NINETEEN THINGS THAT WERE WRONG WITH THEM BUT THEY WERE EXCELLENT AND SO THEN WE HAD TO DEFINE THE STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE SO WOULD I HAVE AS A RECOVERING PERFECTIONISTS SOMEBODY WHO YOU KNOW JUST BEEP MYSELF UP CONSTANTLY FACT I GOT I'M WHE DID PAPER PLAYD A WORDS ON MY SWIMTEAM AND ONE YEAR I WAS GIVEN THE IF ONLY A WORD AD THERE'S A LOOK HARTUNE O ME AND AS AS IF ONLY I'D POINTED MY LEFT PINKITO I WOULD AVE GOTIN AN EIGHT AND A HALF INSTEAD OF AT EIGHT AND THOS LIKE THE STORY MY MY DIVING CAREER AND I DID NOT WANT TOF YOU THAT PERSON ANY MORE AND SO ONE O THINGS I'VE LEARNED TO DO IS TO WHEN I START ANYTHING I'M YET IF I SIT DOWN TO WRITE A BOOK I'M AYMING FOR A NINE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS I'M IN A POOR COUPLE YEARS OF  HAD MY WORK LIFE INTO THIS TOPIC I'M YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOINGTO READ IT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S SURELY THE BEST WORK I CAN PRODUCE SO SHALL MEDA POST I'M O CAT WITH A SEVEN IF I'M ALWAYS SHOTING FOR A NINE I'M NOT IN A POST VERY OFTEN BECAUSE YOU ARE NON YOUR SEALING FOR NINE IS YOUR THRESHOLD FOR NINE IS SO EXCEEDINGLY I YE AND I WANTED TO KEEP GETTING HIGHER OFOR TIMES SO MY IDEA OF A NINE TO DAY IS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO AND I THNK THIS IS THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T DO ENOUGH I'M ESPECIALLY IF YOURE IN EXTREME PERFECTION IS IS THEY DON'T REALIZE O Q I'M BEUT ME LET ME FORGOT HOW IMPORTANT HIS TASK IS AND THEN FOR THIS TASK A SIX IS SUFFICIENT SO THAT THEN I CAN POUR MY ENERGY INTO A PULLING THE THE SEVEN AND A HALF TOWARD A NINE WHERE IT REALLY MATTERS I'M AND INEVITABLY IF YOU DON'T DO THAT WHAT YOU WILL DO IS YOU WILL GET A BUNCH OF NINES I'M THINGS THAT ARE COMPLETELY TRIVIAL I WENT TO A HIGH SCHOOL WHERE WE HAD A COUPLE COULDS GET U PERFECT ON THE ESSAY TE THEY WOULD AVE BIG LIKE THE CENTER FULL THE LIST OF ALL THE EARLY ADMISSIONS TO ALL THE FANCY IVEALY SCHOOLS OR DEFFLING WAS NOT ON THAT LIST I WO'T EVEN KNOW IF I YI ONLY NOPOS ANYWHERE O NEAR THAT LIST IM PROMBABLY NOT IM AND SOME OF THEM HAVE GONE ON TO HAVE TERRIFIC LIVES AND SEEM PRETTY HAPPY AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF THEM AN IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND I I THINK FOR SOME OF THEM THAT PERFORMED EXCEEDINGLY WELL ON STANDARDIZE TESTRLY ON IM I HEAR A BIT MORE DISMAY IN THEIR IN THEIR CURRENT LIFE NOT ALL BUT UM IT IS THERE I HAVE TO IMAGINE THEIR DATA ON SIR EARLY HIGH PERFORMANCE BEING A SEED FOR CHALLE LNGES LATER ON OBVIOUSLY Y DON'T WANT THE THE OPPOSITE UM THE SORT OF WHAT I GUESS THEY REFER TO NOWS A COMYOU DON'T COMPLETE FAILURE TO LAUNCH YOU DON'T PEOPLE NOT MEETING THAT THE MILSTORNS TOWARD BEING I'M SELF SUFFICIENT ADULTS BUT I'M YOT WAT WHONDER SOME OF THE DANGERS OF SUCCESS WHEN THINKING ABOUT REALIZING ONE'S LARGER PROTENTIAL OH THAT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING QUESTION I'M I THINK YET I THINK THEY DID ON THIS GO BOTH WAYS SO YOU KNOW SOME EARLY SUCCESS IS IM YOU KNOW IT'S A MOTIVE ATOR IT BUILDS THE KIND OF MOMENTUM YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IM YOU W THINK THERE'S A GULLSETTING RESEARCHERS LIKE LOCK AND MAKE THEM HAVE TALKED ABOUT A THE HIGH PER FORMANCE CYCLE WHERE YOU HITTAGOAL AND THAND THAT BUILDS YOUR CONFIDENCE AND THEN YOU SET A MORE AMBITIOUS GHOOL AND THEN YOU REACH IT N THERE'S THIS UPWARD SPIRAL OVER A TIME BUT THERE'S ALSO A MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE THAT ACHIEVING YOUR GOALS CAN MAKE YOU COMPLACENT AND THERE'S A I SOMETIMES IAS CALLED THE FAT CATS CENTREM WHERE Y RECEPT UP RESTING ON YOUR LAURELS AND THEN THERE'RE ALSO COMPETENCY TRAPS WHERE YOU GET GOOD AT SOMETHING AND THEN YOU KEEP DOING IT THE WAY YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE IT AND YOU DON'T REALIZE THE WORLD IS CHANGED AROUND YOU LIKE I I'M ALURGIC TO THE IDEA OF BEST PRACTICES THE MOMENT YOU CALL A PRACTICE BEST YOU'VE CREATED AN ILLUSION THAT YOU'RE NOT AND THE MOMENT ITHINK ABOUT A PRECOVED LOT A COMPANY HAS HAD REALLY YOU HAVE WHAT THEY THOUGHT WERE A FACT OF MODELS FOR COLLABORATION AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEIR BEST PRACTICES ARE NOT FEASIBLE ECAUSE EVERYBODY'S WORKING REMOTELY AND THEYVE GOT TA THROW THAT OUT THE WINDOW AND LOOK FOR BETTER PRACTICES FOR AN EVOLVED WORLD SO I THINK I'M THOSE THE THINGS I WORRY ABOUT MOST WITH EARLY SUCCESS I I THINK THAT WONE O THINKGS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE PEOPLE TO WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING POTENTIAL IS IM IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS MY FAILURE BUTET LOOK LIKE SO IM I  TIING MY EXPERIENCE ON THIS I'M YOU STARTED I WROTE I WROTE A FIRST BOOK I'M GAVE ITS HEAD TALK AND PRETTY SOON OUT LIKE I WAS SPENDING EIGHTY PER CENT OF MY TIME SAYING THINGS I READY KNEW AND I WAS GETTING TYGPHCAST I'M NOT LEARNING GROWING BUT I'M ALSO NOT I DON'T FEEL LIKE CONTRIBUTING NEW KNOWLEDGE TO THE WORLD WHAT A'M I GENT TO DO ABOUT THAT AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN ROLLS I LIKE YOU NOW IT THIS I'MIN A START A PODCAST AND THAT WILL BE MY YOU KOW MY LEARNING MECHANISM AND ANY NOW IF HIS CAN WORK I DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE MEDIUM WOULD WORK FOR ME I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE WRE GINA WANT A LISTEN TON MY VOICE I CERTAINLY DON'T I'M MAYBE MORGAN FREEMAN LIKES THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE OTIS I LIKE LISTIN YOUR PODCAST I I ALL SOO N JOY LISTEN YOURS BUT YOU'D I THINK EVERYBODY HATES THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICE I JUST I JUST WASN'T SURE FOR A LOT OF REASONS WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO WORK I'M AND THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND I REALIZE WELL ALL OF THE THE PIVITAL MOMENTS IN MY CAREER HAVE COME FROM TAKING A RISK ND I THOUGHT THAT I NEEDED TO BUILD THE CONFIDENCE IN ORDER TO DO IT AND AS REFLECTING ON GULLSETTING RESEARCHES AS ONE DOES REALIZE YOU KNOW THE CONFIDENCE IS GOING TO COME THROUGH DOING IT IAND SO LET ME TRY IT AND I GUSS WHAT I TOOK AWAY WAS IF I DON'T IF I NEVER FAIL IT MEANS I'M NOT CHALLENGING MYSELF I'M NOT EMBRACING DISCOMFORT I'M I'M NOT BEING ENOUGH OF AN IMPERFECTIONIST SO I'M I SEID I ACTUALLY SET O GOAL THAT I WOULD START AT LEAST ONE PROJECT EVERY YEAR THAT DIDN'T SUCCEED AND LET'S BE CLEAR I'M NOT AIMING FOR FAILURE WHAT I'M DOING IS IS CREATING AN ACCEPTABLE ZONE OF FAILURE TO KNOW THAT THAT'S GONA MOD OV ATES IN RISTAKING AND SOME EXPERIMENTATION AND HOPEFULLY SOME GROWTH ND I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR A LOT O PEOPLE TO DO THIS IN THEIR LIVES SPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW AS SUPERDEMANDING BOSS I'M BUT ANYWHERE WE'RE ALL BETTER OFF FROM A YOU KNOW A GROWTH IN POTENTIAL STANDPOINT IF WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU SUCCEED ON NINETY PER CENTING YOUR PROJECTS THAT SHOULD BE A HUGELY SUCCESSFUL YEAR IF YOU SUCCEED ON A HUNDRED PER CENT I THINK YOU'RE AIMING TOO LOW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT  YOU ERE GULNELLY SPIMMING IN THE BACK YOUR MIN N THAT WOULD BE FUN BUT I IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SHARE A YE THAT FOR YOU STILL STRIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BUT ANXIETY CORD LIKE O NO LIKE E  YU A I O O YU MUSICIAN NOT AT O AGARITN AGAN AT A ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT A BECOMING MUSICIAN OR EXPLORING PLAYING MUSIC I WHAT HOW FTHE REASON I ASK AT THAT WAY IS AM HOW FAR INTO YOUR DISCOMFORT SON DO YOU REACH IN ORDER TO A IN ORDER TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF S BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHATEVER ONE NEEDS OUT THRESHOLDS LIKE A THERE ARE LOT OF THINGS THAT I WISH I COULD PLAY O MUSICAL INSTRUMENT FRANKLY BUT I'M I'M NOT THAT MOTE OF AID TO DO IT MOST BECAUSE I ENJOY HEARING OTHER PEOPLE PLAY MUSIC SO MUCH THAT I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY I'M STATED THERE'S ALSO ENOUGH GOOD MUSIC OUT THERE YOU'L HAVE TO CRATE TE THERE'S DAFFLING ALON A GREAT MUSIC  I'M SO I THINK THERE 'S TECA THERE'S A MICROWN O MACK REVERSION AT THIS SO IN THE MICRO SIDE I'M THEN PAST YEAR IM I'D BET DO THIS WORK LIKE POD CASTS FOR FIVE YEARS WER I WAS YOU HAVE TAKEN THE CORPS OF MY ORKANIS TAY SIAL PSYCHOLOGY WORK AND TRYING TO TAKE ON A TOPIC AND AND MAKE IT INTERESTING AND USEFUL TO PEOPLE AND THEN REALIZING I WAS FEELING CONSTRAINED JUST TA FOCAS ON WORK AND AS A PSYCHOLOGIST THRE'S LOTS OF OTHER THINGS SO WHN TO TAKE ON AS SO WE EXPANDED INTO I'M THE SECOND SHOW RETHINKING AND I HAVE SOME EXPERIMENTS I'M TEMPTED TO TRY BUT I'VE BEEN REALLY HESITANTE DO THEM SO I'M DO YOU WATCH WRESTLING GROWING UP EVER PROFESSIONAL RUSTE A I DID WATCH A LITTLE BIT OF IT AND THEN FOR WHATEVER REASON IN THE LAST YEAR A MY GOOD FRIEND RICK REUBEN WHOS HE'S LIKE NOT OBSESSED BUT HE IS A REAL DEVOT E'S A FAN OF PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING HE HAD ME WATCH SOM M   BUT AN EVEN A W HE WAS EXPLAINING THAT IS BASILY PHYSICAL DRAMA HE'S EXPLAINING WHY IT'S SO ENTRIGUING TO HIM AND SO INFORMATIVE TO HIM AND THEN A I'M A BIG EOH FAN OF A A CERTAIN JOHN ER AMUSING LARGE FREDERICS AND FROM RANCID IS IS A HUGE WRESTLING FANC OR NOW GOT MULTIL PEOPLE THAT I'VE COME INTO CONTACT WITH HER LIKE TELLING ME ALL THE STOUGH ABOUT WRESTLING SO WRESTLING SEEMS TO BE CROPPING UP MORE AND MORE I SO I DON'T KNOW TH E FIRST THING ABOUT WRESTLING I THINK I CAUGHT IT A FEW TIME YOT CEAD LIKE ITEYE IT WAS IS  HALL COGUIN IN A FEW OTHERS PASS ACROSS OR MANN YET YE BUT THE THE THINK THAT I REMEMBER WAS LOVING THE TACTI MATCHES WHERE YE YOSOMEBODY WOULD GET OVERPOWERED AND THN THEY PULL IN SOMEBODY TO HELP I BE SO INTERESTING IF THERE WAS A PODCAST WHERE YOU TAKE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE ON AND YOU STARTED TO BAKE AND THEN SOMEBODY CAN TAG IN IF THEY WANT A CHALLENGE AN ARGUMENT AND SO INSTEAD OF CONSTANT CONCENTRATING ON THE PARTICULAR GUESS YOU HAVE YOU BASICALLY HAVE A PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO YOU HAE TO GET TO THE ROOTS OF AND YOU'E YOUD HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE JUMP IN AND AND HOPEFULLY BUILD TOWARDEM ORE ENCITFUL PERSPECTIVE ON IT I' NO IDEA OF THIS GING TO WORK I'D REALLY LOVE TO TRY IT AND I'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SPOKEN OUT LOUD ABOUT IT BECAUSE MI  DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT IT LIKE THAT I WANT TO SEE THAT CRASH AND BURN AND YET WHY NOT LOK WHAT'S THE REST THINK IT'S SO COOL WE IN RIGHT YOAVE WHAT WN TOPICS OR OR ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT COVERING CAUSE IEGANYTHING ITS A RETTY PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS  BUT I WON'T TO KNOW WHAT THE ONES YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WE I MEAN I'D LITERALLY JUST I MAY NAT THINKING OUT LOUD HERE BUT ONE ONE THAT I THINK ON THE CONTROVERSIAL FRONT THAT WOULD BE COULD BE REALLY RICH IS I'M TO THINK ABOUT POLICIES FOR TRANSATHLETES AND SPORTS THAT'S A CONTROVERSIAL TIY CONTROVERSIAL BUT ALSO I'VE I'VE TALKED TO SOME EXPERTS ON THIS A I'VE TALKED TO SOME TRANSATHLETES I'M IN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEEP IN THIS DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY THINK THE POLICIES SHOULD BE AND SO I I THINK ACTUALLY HEARING THEM TALK AND YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY OF THOSE ISSUES AND THEN OMAY BE HAMMERING OUT WHAT WHAT'S A POLICY WOULD PROPOSE FOR SCHOOLS WHAT WOULD YOU WANT FOR YOU KNOW FOR OLYMPIC EVENTS I I JUST TINK THT WOULD BE FASCINATING AND I'D LOVED IT I'D LOVE TO MODERATE THAT DISCUSSION GOUDNESS A I E WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T LOK OTO I IT INTO THAT OM GLAD YOU WOULD I WOULDN'T THAT SEEMS SOH LIKE ONE OF THE MOST BARBED WIRE TOPICS ONE COULD EVER IM EMBARKIN WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY I KIN A PUTTING MY VOTE YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD DO THIS PODCAST I THINK IT'S AN AMA AZING IDEA ACTUALLY FOLKS PUT IN THE COMMON SECTION ON YOU TWO WHETHER NOT ADAM SHOULD DO THE SPODCAST AND AND THAT TOPIC IN PARTICULAR I THINK IU TE AMAZING BECAUSE AM ONE THING THAT KEEP COMING BACK TO IN MY OWN MIND IS THAT A LOT OF THE CONTROVERSIES OUT THERE STEM FROM THE FACT THAT WE VERY OFTEN HAVE INDIVIDUALS PITTED AGAINST INDIVIDUAL YES AND THERE'S SO MUCH LOST IN THAT A AND I THINK ABOUT SCIENCE AND GOING BACK TO THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD WHERE WE HAVE SUBFIELDS PITTED AGAINST SUBFIELDS WHEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A FIELD LIKE THERE WAS HUGE CONTROVERSY OVER THE STRUCTURE OF D'ENA AND IT WASN'T ONE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST ANOTHER WHAT YOU HAD SMALL GROUPS DIFFERENT CAMPS AND THERE AS SOME PARTIAL OVERLAPD THERE'S ALSO YOU KNOW IF YOU READ THE DOUBLE HELIX THERE WAS ALSO A LOT OF A A I BEHE BEHAVIOR YELSE PEOPLE ENTERING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS JUST TO GLEAN INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER SIDIEN HUMAN BEINGS NOT AT NOT AT THEIR FINEST A BUT IN ANY EVENT SMALL PANELS ARGUING COMPETING TEAMS COMPETING I THINK IS A FAR MORE INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE THAN INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW BUDTING HEADS I THINK SO TOO AND I THINK A YOU NOW KNOWTHER ANOTHER ONE THAT I THINK WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTED INPEOPLE WHO SAY GREAT MINES THINK ALIKE NO GREAT MIND CHALLEGE EACH OTHER TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND WHEH JUST DON'T DO ENOUGH OF THAT SO II BEEN HEA LOT POLITICALLY WHAT IF WE BROUGHT TOGETHER A BUNCH OF PEOPLE I WHO ARE NOT IDEALOGUES BUT ARE REALLY INTERESTED AND PRAGMATIC POLICY SOLUTIONS TO REWRITE THE CONSTITUTION IF WE ARE GIN TO BILD ONE TO DAY YOU'D LIKE TO TACKLE BIG STOFF I I KNO I LOVE IT I LOVE IT AT COMPLIMENT IT'S A COMPIN NO WHAT I THE ODDS LIKE AS SAID EARLIER NO WEEK SAUCE NO WEEKS AUSI YOU JUST AS YOUR YOU'D GO RIGHT FOR IT I MEAN THESE LISTEN THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY ACTIVATED BY BECAUSE THESE ARE REALLY COR ISSUES THEY THEY GET DOWN TO THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THEY'RE IN THE HYPOTHALMAS AS WE SAID BUT I DON' THETHES SHOULD BE I LOOK AT THESE TOPICS AND THINK I JUST WANT TO GET IT RIGHT I DON'T HAVE A VEST TO INTEREST IN WHAT THE MODEL SHOULD BE I JUST KNOW THAT EVEN THE WISEST PEOPLE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO WERE NOT PREPARED TO ANTICIPATE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TO DAY AND WE OUGHT TO BE CONSTANTLY I DO'T KNO I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD LIVE IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU AFFIRM YOUR BELIEFS I THINK THE ONLY WAY YOU LEARN IS BY CONTINUALLY EVOLVING YOUR BELIEFS AND SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO FINGERE OUT MORE WAYS TO CATALIZE THAT AROUND ISSUES PEOPLE CARE ABOUT BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES I CARE ABOUT THE STRETCHING OF THINKING AND THE IMPROVING THE WAY THAT THE WORLDWORKS I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS PODCAST WITH THE TAG TEAM FOREMANT I LOVE THAT YOU GLEANED IT FROM WATCHING WRESTLIN AT A TIMES A AROUND THESE A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES I PROMISE YOU THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND IMPORTANT PODCAST IN ON THE PLANET EARTH  MI BEPOTCAST ON OTHER PLANETS I HEAR THAT THE YOU GALIXES FAR FAR AWAY WITH A THEY MAY HAVE POT CAST YOU MAY HAVE HADE THEM FOR MUCH LONGER THAN WE HAVE BUT UM THAT'S A THAT'S A WINNER WELL MAYBE IT MAYBE I'LL TRY IT AS A LITTLE EXPERIMENT ON THE RETHINKING FEET AND SEE IF IT'S AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER WELL YOU KNOW WHERE MY VOTE LIES I FRECIATE THAT SO OCASE O TO GO ABACK YOUR QUESTION FOR SECOND ON THE MACKRA SIDE I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT TO BE FUN TO TRY TO WRITE A SI FI NOVEL AND THE QUESTION I'M WRESTLING WITH WRITE NOW AS IS THAT A GOOD USE OF MY TIME THER GREAT SIFI WRITERS OUT THERE THERE AREN'T THAT MANY SOCIAL SCIENTISTS COMMUNICATING ABOUT THE TOPICS THAT IHT DO AND IT FEELS LIKE IT MIGHT BE I DO'T KNOW ILIC THIS IS IT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH OF A DIVERSION THEN AGAIN ACCORDING TO YOUR WORDS AM YOU HAD NO TALENT AND DIVING BUT YOU EXCEEDED T ALL ALL A PERFORMANCE MATTRICS AM BY BY CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT A THROU MOTIVATION AND A AND OPPORTUNITY NTELRIGHT AM I VOTE YES I'M NOT I HAVEN'T READ MUCH SIPHIR MAYBE ANY TO READ READ MORSIPHI ARE YOU FANOSI F I LEFT SIPHA THIT'S IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE WAYS TO IMAGINE A BETTER WORLD AND ALSO YE PREVENT A WORSE ONE FROM EMERGING BUT I DON'T KNOW THERE'S AT THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT THINKS ITHERE'S A AS RUBURN SIN IN COLLEAGUES  DID THI'S DOU KNOW THIS REECERTANDAM NOBOUT PRIZE WENNING SCIENCIS AND WHAT DIFERENCATES THEM FROM THEIR PIERSE A NO BUT I BEING THE SON OF HIS ASSIST IN HAVING BEEN SURROUNDED BY JUST BY CIRCUMSTANCE A NUMBER OF NOBLE PRIZE WINTERS A WHEN I WAS A KID YOUNG KID A VERY CURIOUS NOWHAT IT WHAT THAT THIS RESERT SAYS AN ME THAT THERES THER'RE MANY THEMES YOU CAN CLEAN FROM IT BUT THAT THE THING THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT AT ME IS A THE NOBOUL PRIZE WENTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TOHAVE ARTISTIC HOBBIES FINEMEN CERTAINLY DID YET A THEN TTHERE'S A LONG LIST O THEM BUT IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN IN THE DATA IT WAS A THEY'RE TWICE AS LIKELY AS THERE PEERS TO PLAY A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THE'RE SEVEN TIMES AS LIKELY TO DRAW OR PAIN THEY'RE TWELVE TIMES AS LIKELY TO DO A POETRY OR FICTION CREATOF WRITING AND GET THERE'S TWENTY TWO TIMES AS LIKELY AS THERE PEERS TWENTY TWO TO DANCE ACT OR YES PERFORM IS MAGICIANS WELL FORM ER MAGICIAN AS VERY SAT AVATISIT YOU KNOW WHY WASN'T GOING TO ASK ABOUT MAGIC BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT IT I WAS ON A TE CATE YOU WIN EVERY YEAR TAKE MY SISTER IN NEW YORK FOR HER BIRTHDAY MY BIRTHDAY CAUSES OUR BIRTHDAYS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER AND WE WENT AND SAW A MAGICIAN MENTALIST UM BY THE NAME OF ASI WIND I AM AZI I THINK A SECRET PRONOUNCIATION AM WHO JUST JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME I SAWM ABSOLUTELY BLUE MY MIND I THERE'S NO WAY IT'S NOT MAGIC OF COURSE I KNOW IT'S NOT MAGIC BUT IT'S UM TBUT MINER STANDING IS THAT THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT HE ANDOTHER GREAT MENTALIST AN MAGICIANS DO WHERE THEY ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE OUTCOME THEY'RE THE'RE PLAYING IT'S PROBABLISTIC MAND SO THERE'S A RISK AND A THRILL FOR THEM TOO AMAND THAT THEY'RE ALSO CREATING MEMORIES IN A RACING MEMORIES AND UM OF SOMETHING THAT WE I MAY HOST ASSI ON THE POD GAS BECAUSE I REFLUNT HE'S VERY FAC T OF IT CREATING MEMORIES IN A RACING MEMORIES THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT HE DOES AND HE HAS TACTICS TO DO THAT IN ANY EVENT UM I WASN'T GOING TO ASK ABOUT MAGIC BUT I KNOW THAT YOU WERE A PROFESSIONAL MAGICIAN A I WON'T POINT NYOUR LIFE UM AND THAT YOU YOU DID THIS PRESENT BECAUSE YOU ENJOYED DOING IT UM BUT GETTING BEYOND THE THE SORT OF A PULL RABBIT O THE HAT OR PICKIT OR IDENTIFY THE CARD THAT THE PERSON PICKED OUT OF A THE SHUFFLED STACK UM WHAT IS IT IN WHAT WAS IT ABOUT MAGIC THAT INTRIGUES YOU DOES IT INFORM HIM ANYTHING ABOUT UM THE WORK THAT YOU DO NOW IT DOES YET I YOU I THINK IT WHEN I STARTED O WAS TWELVE AND I WAS JUST IT WAS JUST FUN AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO ENTERTAIN OTHER PEOPLE AND ENTERTAIN MYSELF IN THE PROCESS AND THEN YAU NOW BECAME A CHALLENGE CAN I LEARN THIS NEW SKALE AND CAN I Y MASTER THIS TRICK I THINK I'M NURTIOUS THING I DID IT COLLEGE WAS I STARTED A MAGIC CLUB THA DAVID QUANG WHO IS A A TELLER  MAGICIAN AND A CRUCIVERBALIST AS HE CALLS IT CRUSIVERBLESS HE DOES IM MAGIC CROSSWORD PUZZLES ESSENTIALLY THAT I I CAN'T DO IT JUSTICE YOU HAVE TO SEE IT IT'S UNREAL I'M AND I WATCH HIM FOR YOU KNOW OUR FIRST PERFORMANCE TOGETHER AND REALIZE ONE OF US IS GOING TO MAKE IT AS A MAGICIAN AND IT'S NOT ME I ISES IT STANDING ANYWAY I'M THE WAY OF FIGURES IN MY WORK NOW IS I THINK SO MUCH OF GOOD SCIENCE COMMUNICATION AS MIS DIRECTION AND IT'S THE SAME SGKILLE I USED AS MAGICIAN IF I TOLD YOU THAT THE THE CARD YOU PICKED WAS ABOUT I DISAPPEAR FROM THE DECK AND APPEAR ROUND THE WINDOW YOU WOULD NOT BE NEARLY AS INTRIGUED AS IF IT HAPPENED BY SURPRISE AND I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE WHEN WHE WE COMMUNICATE KNOWLEDGE I THINK IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY WHY SO MANY OF MY POST YOU FLAGGE THIS EARLY OR SO MANY OF MY POSTSTART WITH I'M YOU KNOW THIS THING IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THIS OTHER THING I'M I THINK THAT OU NOW CHALLEGING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM QUESTIONING ASSUMPTIONS IS IS WHAT SURPRISES PEOPLE IM AND THEN LEADS THEM TO THINK EITHER I HAVE SOMETHING TO LEARN OR DON'T KNOW I GOT A PUT A SHIELD BECAUSE MY BELIEFS ARE BEING I'M CHALLEN S YOUR ATTACT AND I THINK THAT THE ART FORM OF MAGIC WAS ALWAYS ABOUT CREATING A SURPRISE THAT WOULD DELIGHT PEOPLE I'M AS UPPOSED TO LEADING PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY WERE TRICKED OR DUPED OR MANIPULATED AND SO I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR ME IS TO SAY OKI I WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WE KNOW FROM BEHAVERAL SCIENCE I'M YET MOSTLY FOCUSSING ON PSYCHOLOGY AS TAT'S MY CUOREXPERTISE I'M WHAT D WE KNOW THAT'S ACTUALLY DIFFERENT FROM MOST INTUITION AND THEN HOW DO I EXPLAIN THAT IN A WAY THAT SURPRISES PEOPLE BUT LEAVES THEM TO SAY OH THAT'S SO INTERESTING AS UPPOSED TO THAT'S WRONG AND THAN WANT TO FIGHT ABOUT IT S ALMOST AS IF YOU GIVE THEM THE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TEACH THEM SO THAT THE OH THAT'S WRONG CAN'T I BE THE AVAILABLE RESPONSE YBECAUSE IN MAGIC IT ITO IT'S IT'S UM EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S MAGIC JUST LIKE WITH PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING FOLKS BY THE WAY THERE'S THERE'S PRIOR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN MAYBE THEY GO OFF SCRIPT BUT I THINK THAT'S OU SHE I THINK PART OF THE INTEREST IN PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING FOR THOSE THAT ARE EXTREME FANS OF PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING IS THAT THEY ALMOST WANT TO WONDER ABOUT WHETHER SOME OF IT IS NOT IN THE PLAN BUT THET I'S A SUSPENSION OF REE OF REALITY THAT I SEEM TO ENJOY BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW SOMETHINGS VAGUE OR WELL WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE I SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT MY LANGUAGE IN WITH MAGIC LIKE WHY WHEN SEE OSIAMN I I DON'T THINK IT'S ACTUAL MAGIC BUT HE'S ABLE TO GIVE THE ILLUSION OF MAGIC THE REAL ILLUSION IS THAT IT'S MAGIC RIGHT IT'S NOT THE ILLUSION OF MAKING THE CARD HOP TO SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE ROOM UM AND HE IS PHENOMENALN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE GILL SEE HO SHOW IF IF THEY GET THE OPPORTUNITY BUT THE I THIK THEY'RE  DOING A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HIM NOW ACTUALLY ET'LL BE INSOME NATFLIC STOFF IS HAY U BUT IT'S THE ILLUSION THAT MAGIC EXISTS THAT'S SO EXCITING A SO WITH SCIENCE COMMUNICATION YET I ALWAYS A AIM FOR FOUR THINGS I DON'T ALWAYS E EAVE THEM BUT AND I THINK YOU DO AS WELL IIF I MADE THAT I'M A TOPIC BE INTERESTING CLEAR IDEALLY ACTIONABLE BUT NOT ALWAYS AND THA THE QUAD FACT AS WHEN IT'S ALSO SURPRISING SO INTERESTING CLE YOUR ACTIONAL AND SURPRISING SORT O IS THE THE ULTIMATE IF THEY'R'S SURU LIKE OH I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT BUT IT'S IT'S HARD TO FIND DATA POINTS THAT SATISFYIN ALL FORHER YETTERY AND THE SURPRISING IS THE LEAST SIMPORTANT BY FAR I'M I I ASSUME TABLE STAKES IS IT'S RIGOROUS OH WELL OKS SITTING UNDERNEATH ALL FOUR OF THOSE POINTS ARE I THAT IT'S SCIENT THAT IT'S ACTUAL SCIENCE RIGHT SO ONE DIDN'T YOU SAY IT RIHT IS NOT CONJECTURE OR THEORY SO THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S DATA TO SUPPORT IT AND THAT THE DATA WERE COLLECTED WITH WITH THE APPROPRIATE MOUNT OF RIGOR RIGHT SO THERE'S AT THERE'S A RESERVOIR STUFF THAT THIT'S UNDERNEATH AS A FOUND YES AND SO GE GIVEN ETHE BASE LINE OF RIGOR HOW DO I FIND WHAT'S INTERESTING CLEAR ACTIONABLE AND HOPEFULLY SURPRISING ALTHOUGH I WOULD AT KAT I WOULD MAKE A CASE I'S A CLASSIC ARTICLE THAT MURRAY DAVIS WROTE WHEN MY ALL TIME FAVORITES IS A A SOSIOLOGIST WHO WROTE A PAPER CALLED THAT'S INTERESTING AND HE OPENED THE PAPER BY SAYING I'M IDEAS LIVE NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE TRUE BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE INTERESTING WHICH DECIMATED ONE OF MY CORT BELIEFS I I THOUGHT IT WAS ACCURACY THE DROVE PEOPLE'S BELIEFS AND HE SAID NO IDEAS LIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE INTERESTING AND THEN HE GOES TO BUILD AN INDEX OF THE INTERESTING TO EXPLAIN WHEN PEOPLE ARE INTRIGUED AND HIS CASE IS THAT MOST OF INTEREST IS SURPRISE AND HE BREAKS DOWN ALL THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN TURN COMMENTIONAL WITHS HIM UPSIDE DOWN YOU CAN SAY THAT I'M SOMETHING YOU TOUGHT WAS BAD WAS ACTUALLY GOOD OR VICE VERSA YOU CAN ARGUE THAT I'M SOMETHING YOU THUGHT WAS HOMOGENIUS IS ACTUALLY HETEROGENIUS IYOU CAN ARGUE THAT SOMETHING YOU THOUGHT WAS INDIVIDUAL WAS ACTUALLY A COLLECTIVE PHENOMENON OR VICE OF HOR SUNIES HE'S GOT THIS WONDERFUL BREAK DOWN OF OF ALL THE WYS OF BEING INTERESTING AND HE'S THE ONE Y ADE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN IDEAS THAT A CHALLENGE WEEKLY HELD ASSUMPTIONS INTRIGUING YOU AND STRONGLY HELD ASSUMPTIONS I'M YOU NO SORT OF OFFENDING YOU BUT THINK FROM DAVIS'S VIEW AND I THINK E 'S RIGHT A HUGE AMOUNT OF INTEREST IS SURPRISE AND SO BUT I DON'T THINK IT'STHE ONLY DRIVER OF INTEREST SO I MIGHT I MIGHT TAKE YOUR CRITERIA AND SAY O CAN WE START WITH RIGGER WE ONTO GO TO INTEREST CLARITY AND ACTION ABILITY HOW DO YOU TO INTEREST LET'S BUILD A SUB MODEL OF THE FACTORS THE DRIVE INTERESTS AND SURPRISE MIGHT BE AT MIGHT HAVE THE BIGGEST BADE AWAIT IN THE REGRESSION AQUATION I BUT WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE DRIVE INTERESTS I HAVE A COUPLE OF HYPOTHESES I WN T HEAR YOURS YOU'VEBEEN DOING THIS ACTIVELY AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVELY BEYOND SURPRISE WHAT ELSE INTERESTS PEOPLE IN YOUR CONTENT ANYTHING THAT DRAWS ON SELF REFLECTION FOR THEM I THINK WE ALL HAVE AN IT IN A DESIRE TO BETTER INTERSTAND OURSELVES WHY WHY WE WORK THE WAY WE DO WHY WE DON'T WORK AS WELL AS WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCERTAIN DOMANS LIKE SOME AN ENCAST UNDERSTANDING ON ON OUR EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS TOO LIKE OH NOW IT MAKE SENSE LIKE TAT WIT A GOING BACK TO THE THE CANTI EPISODES BUT WE DID SEVERAL THEM SO FOR M I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE YOU TO LEARN FROM HIM THAT NARCISISM IS ENVY IT REPRESENTS IT A EXTREME DEFICIENCY IN THE PLEASURE A THAT PE NARSES CAN HAVE AN EXTREME PLEASURE DRY BUT THEY THEY ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE FAR LESS THAN THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVEIN THAT OTHERSS HAVE FAR MORE OF IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT SAME YEARNING FOR IT RIGHT AND SO THAT NARSISM AT ITS CORS IS DEEP ENVY THAT TO ME WAS LIKE WOW I YOU KNOW AND TO TO REALIZE THAT NOW UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THIS DISCUSSION THAY HEAR OUT THERE ABOUT NARSIS EVERON CALLING OTHER PEOPLE NARSES THAT A THERE ARE GENUINE NARCISIS OUT THERE AND WHAT THEY REALLY SUFFER FROM IS AN EXTREME DEFISIT IN PLEASURE AND THEIR CONSTANTLY ENVIOUS OF OTHERS IT REFRAMED EVERYTHING I THOUGHT ABOUT NARSISIS ABOUT THEM BEING OVERBEARING WHICH THEY CAN BE AND OFTEN ARE A ET CETERA ET CETERA ET SO I THINK IT'S ALSO ANYTHING THAT LEADS TO A LIKE OH I CAN I CAN I CAN NAVIGATE NARSISIS BETTER WITH THAT WELL THAT IVE THAT TAKES ALL YOUR BOXES I IS VERY SURPRISING CAUSE ITS NOT THE WAY MENORMALLY UNDERSTAND ARCICISM BUT I THINK O YOU HAD NO FOR ME WHAT'S THE MAYBE EVEN IT'S AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS SURPRISED MAYBE MORE SO IS SELF RELEPHANTS AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ACTIONABLE RIGHT IT HAS TO IN AE LOTTICASES JUST HELP YOU UNDERSTAND OR MAKE SENSE OF SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN PUZZLANGER THAT'S YOU KNOW THIT'S I'M YOU KNO SORT OF II THNKIM I'M ALMOST ALWAYS SURPRISED WHEN I SAY SOMETHING FROM BE NO HERE HERES HERE'S A SYNTHESIS OF RESEARCH HERE'S A MEDANALYSIS AND I THINK ITS KIND OF OBVIOUS AND PEOPLE GET EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT GAVE THEM LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING THEYAD FELT BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO AR ARTICULATE OR TALK ABOUT AND I THINK THAT I TH THEN THINK IS IS WHY MOST THE MOST POPULAR TADTOKS IM ARE ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIOR IM BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PEOPLE  AND IF YOU LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT YOU OR ABOUT OTHERS YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY DO ANYTHING WITH THAT IT' TO FIND IT INTRIGUING AND EVEN USEFUL IM BECAUSE IT ENRICH YOUR WORLD VIEW A RECENT GUESS ON THIS PODCAST WE HAVENAN ERRED IT YET BUT UM MAYBE IT W'LL BE OUT BY TIMEIS THE SARS WAS WITH A LEAST FORFILLDMEN BEAR IT SHEIS EM APSYCHOLOGIS TURN NERT TENTIS RIGHT STADIES E MOTIONERS IN OF CURSE YAND SHE DESCRIBED UM  HOW IN CERTAIN CULTURES THEREIS A LANGUAGE FOR SUBCATEGORIES OF EMOTION I STIL GRANULARY I SO YOU KNONT AS SHE DESCRIBED A WORD IN JAPANESE I DON'T RECALL WIT THE WORD WAS UM THAT DESCRIBES THE THE FEELING OF SADNESS THAT ONE HAS AFTER GETTING A PARTICULARLY BAD HAIR CUT SOMETHING THAT I DON'T DONK YOU OR I A ARE FAMILIAR WITH BUT I'M FAMILIAR WITH FROM MY EXPERIENCE OF A ROMANTIC PARTNERS BEING LIKE REALLY UNHAPPY OTHER HAIR CANNU YOU LIKE YOU'R SAD BUT THE' BUT BY HAVING A SPECIFIC WORD FOR SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE PEOPLE FEEL LESS ALONE AND THE FEELING PASSES MORE QUICKLY IN TIME AND AND THEN SHE GIVE SOME OTHER EXAMPLES A FROM GERMAN AND FROM YOU KNOW A SKANANEVIAN UM LANGUAGES AND SO FORTH AND I FIND THIT SO INTERESTING IT'S LIKE THE MOMENT PEOPLE HERE THAT THEY ARE NOT ALONE IN AN EXPERIENCE THERE'S NOTHING ACTIONABLE ABOUT IT BUT IT IT CREATES A CO NG MEAF SHIFT THEREAFTER WHICH THEY SUFFER LOSS IM MAY FEEL MORE CONNECTED TO OTHERS I MAI THINK IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF EXACTLY WHAT YOURE REFERRING TO LIKE WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT SOMETHING AND WE WE IDENTIFY WITH IT IT'S POWERFUL IT'S VERY POWERFUL AND I THINK I'M PSYCHOLOGEIS OFTEN SAY NAME IT TO TANEMINT I'M AFFECT LABELLING IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE A MOSTION REGULATION TRAGEDIES WHEN WE TELL IT WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT DISTRACTION AND REFRAMING EARLIER I SHOULD HAVE SAID THERE'S A THIRD STRAGEGY WHICH IS LITERALLY JUST TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR FEELING I'M IT IT SEEMS TO ALLOW PEOPLE THAN TO REASON WITH AN PROCESS WHATEVER THEIR FEELING IS UPPOSED TO ALLOWING THE FEELING TO CONTROL THEM AND I I PROBABLY GOT THE CLEAREST SENSE OF THIS AN I'M IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M I READ A AND YOUR TIME'S ARTICLE IN I'M IN LANGUISHING I'M THE FEELING OF MAD OR BLOS AND I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING I ANY ARTICLE I WROTE RESINATE LIKE THIS AND IJUST THE I ALL THAT THE PO THE POSTE TAGNETE WERE JUST LIKE IT ME IT ME IT US ER'S SU LIKE ONE IN TWO WORD REACTIONS AND  I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE CONTENT THE MATTER TO PEOPLE IT WAS THE JUST HAVING THE TERM I'M ALL THE SUDDEN PEOPLE REALIZES TER RISINALLY QURRY KEYSS RESEARCH I WAS REFERENCING I'M IT HAD BEEN A LIGHTBALL FOR ME TO SAY THERE'S A IF YOU THNK ABOUT THE SPECTRUM OF WELL BEING THIS IS RELATED TO YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS FIRSES MENTAL HEALTH DISTINCTION I'M THOSE ARE TWO EXTREMES OF THE CONTINUEN AND AT ONE END WE HAVE DEPRESSION IN BURN OUT ON ANOTHER END WE HAVE YOU NOT WELL BEING AN FLOURISHING LANGUISHING LIFFS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AS QUARRY DESCRIBES IT IT'S THE ABSENCE OF WELL BEING SO YOU'RE NOT DEPRESSED YOU STILL HAVE HOPE YOURE NOT BURN OUT YOU STILL HAVE ENERGY BUT YOU'RE NOT AT PEIQU FUNCTIONING YOUR MISSING A SENSE OF PURPOSE I'M YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR STAGNATING AND YOU'R EMPTY AND YET THERE'S SOMTHING ABOUT JUST SAYING THE WORD LANGUISHING THAT LED PEOPLE TO TO REALIZE YET THAT'S A THING AND COURSE WE'RE LANGUASHING WERE STANDING STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL EXPERIMENT THAT NO ONE OPPET IT INTO WHICH VIOLATES ALL RULES OF CONSENT IM BY SCIENCE LES SI MI CHECK IM BUT I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT PROBABLY IS UNDER REPRESENTED WHEN WE'RE TRAIN TO COMMUNICATE A SCIENTISTS TO SAY ON OF THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS WE DO AS WE GIVE PEOPLE LANGUAGE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS I THINK THAT'S A MASSIVE PART OF OF YOUR IMPACT IS THIS IS WONE THE BIG THINGS I'VE LEARNED FROM YOU ATURS I I I USED TO BE A LITTLE BIT DISMISSIVE OF IM OF COGNATIVE NARROW SCIENE IN PARTICULAR I THOUGHT UNDERSTANDING THE BRAIN HAS NOT TAUGHT ME THAT MUCH ABOUT THE MIND BEING ABLE T YOU KNOW TRACE IM LET THES TAKE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE LIKE WHEN I READ JOLADU'S RESEARCH BEING ABLE TO TRACE IM YOU KNOW CERTAIN IM A MIGDULA RESPONSE IS IM YOU KOW AS THE RUDE OF HOW PEOPLE DEAL WITH FIGHTER FLIGHT AND AND THREAT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT HELP ME THAT MUCH IF I CAN JUST DESCRIBE FIHTER FLIGHT TO I NEED THE AMIGDOLA AND YOU'VE COMMINCED ME I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IM THE NEROLOGICAL SUBSTRATES OF THEIR THOUGHTS FEELINGS AND ACTIONS THEY BELIEVE THEM MORE THEY'RE LIKE OH  THERE IS A MECHANISM FOR THIS IT'S BEING PRODUCED INSIDE MY HEAD EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T SEE IT IT'S THERE AND IT CAN BE STUDIED WITH THE TOOLS OF SCIENCE I THINK THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL AND I  I REALLY REGRET THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T SPEND MORE TIME ON TALKING OF NORW SCIENCCS I TINK I'D BE A BETTER SIGHT A BETTER PSYCHOLOGISTS DAY WELL THE UNTHANKS FOR THE KIND WORDS I THINK THAT U A FORTUNATE EVOLUTION IN OUR FIELDS WE'RE EVEN FELD IF I MAY UM OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IS THAT WHEREAS NORL SCIENCE ITSELF YOVE NEEDS TO BE SUB DIBIDENTO NERNATOMY AND THE NOR PHYSIOLOGY IT'S LUMPTON TO ALL NORRL SCIENCE BUT IT NOW INCLUDES PSYCHOLOGY  COMPUTATIONAL NORL SCIENCE COGNUN ORSITS AT'S ALL YOU KNOW I THINK CONSIDER US UM  NW WE HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES IN DIFFERENT TRAINING OBVIOUSLY BUT DOING A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS UM JUST A USING DIFFERENT ON DIFFERENT DISECTION TOOLS IT DOT FRENT DIFFERENT LANGUAGE BASE TOOLS AND LISTEN WHAT YOU'VE DONE A I WONT TO SAY MASTERFULLY I MEAN  JUST WITH LIKE EXTREME VIRTUOSITY IS TO WRAP YOUR HANDS ROUND SUCH AN ENORMOUS LITERATURE RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGY HIM IN THE HUMAN MIND AND BEHAVIOUR AND THOUGHT PROCESIS EMOTIONS AND PETENTIAL ANDS YOU SO MANY TOPICS AND TO I AND TO EXTRACT THE THE MOST VALUABLE GEMS FROM THAT LITERATURE AND COMMUNICATE THEM IN A WAY THAN ANY ONE CAN UNDERSTAND AND I ET ITS IS IT'S AN EXTREME GIFT OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND IT'S IM AND IT'S CLEAR IT'S WORKING BECAUSE LIKE YOU MENTION THIS ARTICLE IN LANGUAGH IN WHICH WE WILL PROVIDE A REFERENCE TO OUR LINK TO IN OUR CAPTIONECAUSE I WANT TO GO READ THAT NOW I MEAN I'M ALWAYS STRUCK BY THIS FEELING OF LIKE IT MIGHT I'M NOT TIRED BUT YOU KNOW WHY I'VE GOT THOMS TO DO WILL I WHY DO I JUST WANT US LIKE SIT HERE FOR AN WONLY MAY BE I NEED TO SIT HERE BUT THEN YOU GET IN AT ALL LIKE THE A OKE BUT YOU NOW NEED IT THERE'S A LOT TO DO THERE'S LOT TO GET UP AND GO I DON'T WAT A WASTE MY LIFE AND YE A REST IS GOOD TO BUT I THINK LANGUASHING IS SOMETHING THAT THE I DEF LINCOLN RESINATE WITH THAT WHEN I HAD A BULL DOG IT FALT A LOT EASIER TO DO CAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS LANGUISHING BUT A DO YOU EVER JUST LANGUISH OR OR YOU BUSY ENOUGH THAT YOU YOU JUST FEEL LIKE YOUR ALWAYS A FORWARD CENTERAMASS I THINK EVERYBODY LANGUISES THIN ITS PART OF THE HUMAN CONDITION AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE EVOLUTIONARILY ADAPTIVE BECAUSE I REMEMBER AM ANOTHER SORT OF MY ALTERING IDEA I REMEMBER READING RANDY NESSY'S ARGUMENT THAT MILD DEPRESSION COULD BE EVOLUTIONARILY FUNCTIONAL THAT YOU KNOW IT DOIT  OBVIOUSLY CLINICAL DEPRESSION I'M IS DIBILITATING IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT LOW GRADE SADNESS I'M LINCOLN'S MELANCHOLY I WE KNOW WHYNE ONE OF THINKS AT CAN DO IS BROADEN YOUR FEEL DIVISION I'M AND YOU KNOV FOR FOR MANY PEOPLE SADNESS IS A SIGNAL THAT SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING AND IT CAN MOTE OF A PROBLEMSOLIN I' IT CAN IN SOME CASES I'M OPEN ACT CESS TO NEW PERSPECTIVES I'M UNFORTUNATELY THOSE POTENTIAL BENEFITS ARS OF SADNESS ARE OFTEN OVERRIDDEN BY THE MODE OF ATIONAL COST AND ALSO THAT THE FACT THAT YOU'D NOW SPEND ALL THIS TIME REGULATING YOUR SADNESS AND WONDERING WHY YOU'RE SAD RIHT AND SO ITS IT'S HARD A HARNESS BUT I'M I I HAD A SIMILAR THOUGHT ABOUT LANGUISHING FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE MOMENTS OF LANGUISHING OPEN A SUBTITUTE I'M WHEN WE GET STUCK I SOMETIMES WE REALIZE YOU HAVE TO MOVE BACKWARD IN ORDER TO MAKE PROGRESS I'M SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO UNLEARND THINGS THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW IM IN ORDER TO TO KEEP GROWING AND I'M I YOU KNOW I DON'T I A FRIEND MIND SAID AT HE READ MY LANGUISHING PIECELELY YOU'RE NOT THE LANGUISHING TYPE IMI BOOK I MAYBE EVERYBODY'S BASE LINE IS DIFFERENT LIKE I I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I'M I'M REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE IS HI RESERVES OF ENERGY I'M BUT FOR ME LANGUISHING IS  I FELT LIKE I DID NOTHING TO DAY I'M AND OU NOW IN A TYPICAL DAY LIKE IF I'M WRITING A BOOK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE A THOUSAND WORDS I'M PROUD OF AN ANA LIKE A SINGLE WORD THAT I PRODUCED OR I SAT AT MY BLINKING CURSE LIKE STARING AT THE COMPUTER SCREEN AND FOR THE UMPTENTH TIME WONDERD LIKE DID THEY CALL IT A CURSER BECAUSE OF ALL THE WRITERS WHO CURSED HIM AND THEN I HAD UP LIKE GOUGLING WHAT'S THE LIKE WHAT OR THE LATIN ROOTS OF THE WORD CURSER WHERE DID THIS COME FROM AND THAT IS NOT A GOOD USE OF TIME THAT'S LIKE THAT'S NOT FORWARD MASS THI S LAG I'M SPINNING SO YE I I THINK EVERYBODY LANGUISHS I AND I ASPIRE TO DO IT LESS OFTEN BUT NOT NEVER WELL THET WHAT DOS CURSY WHAT IS THE RUDER CURSER PEOPLE LOOK IT UP PUT IF BOKS PUT IN PUT IT IN THE COMMENTS ON YOU TO H I DID I DID LOOK IT UP OH GET O O LITLE TELIS NOW NO I FEE LIKE THERE'S A THERE'S A FOOTNOTE AND HID IN POTENTIAL I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER IT COMES FROM IM COURERE I THINK AND IM THE CURSER I'M ORIGINALLY CAME NO I N'TWAT TO DO IT I NA OM IT AT RREVER THIS IS A YOU'RE HIT ATTER T A YOURE HYPPIGAMPOSSIS SMART ENOUGH TO E DISCARDED THAT INFORMATION A O YOU HAVE MORE IMPORTANTHINGS TO DO FORGIVE ME FOR ASKING THE QUESTION FOLKS PUT IN THE COMMENTS ON YOU TO SO GOOD I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION ABOUT POTENTIAL YOU HAVE CHILDREN CORRECT THREE AM AND A LOT OF OUR LISTENERS EITHER OUR CHILDREN OR HAVE CHILDREN AM AND EVEN FOR THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE CHILDREN I'M CURIOUS WITH THEY VAST ARRAY OF KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU NOW HAVE ABOUT POTENTIAL AND THE FACT THAT KIDS ARE THESE INCREDIBLE SPONGES WRIGHT THEY I MEAN THEY THEY CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED DISCOMFORT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE SPONGES WE ABSOLUTELY KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THEIR FILTERS WE TRY ND TEACH THEM TO BE FILTERS AND HOPLY THEY ARE IMPERFECTIONESS MAYBE THEIR KIDS THERE JUST PERFECTIONIS BY DEFAULT BUT TO IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE BECAUSE STANDARDS COME ABOUT WHEN WE BECOME AWARE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE RIGHT WHAT SORTS OF MESSAGES DO YOU RECOMMEND PARENTS GIVE THEIR KIDS AND WHAT SORTS OF MESSAGES ARE YOU ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THAT PERHAPS ARE DIFFERENT THAN YOU A WERE PRIOR TO RESEARCHING AND WRITING YOUR BOOK ON POTENTIAL OH INTERESTING HIL THE FIRST ANTO SAY IS A BECKY KENNEDY DOCTOR BECKY IS MY FAVORITE SOURCE OF INSIGHT AN PARENTING AND SHES CHANGED THE WAY I THINK OF TAT THE WAY I THING ABOUT A LOT OF WHAT I DO WITH OUR KIDS AM BUT MY WIFE ALLISON IS SHE HER INSTINCTS ABOUT EFFECT OF PARENTING ARE SO SOPHISTICATED I FEEL LIKE EVERY DAY I LEARND SOMETHING FROM WATCHING HER COMMUNICATE WITH OUR KIDS AND SO I I CAME IN THINKING I IT I WRITE THIS BOOK ABOUT POTENTIAL AM I CAN T DO APPRENTING CHAPTER BECAUSE I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE RELEVANTS A PARENTS AND IM SURE ENOUGH THERE'S THE CHAPTER THAT HAD NOTHING TO APPARENTING WHERE AOH ACTUALLY IM AM READING THIS RESEARCH AND THERE WAS A MOME ANT WHERE I DID SOMETHING WELL AND I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN TO DO IT I'M AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK EVERY ONE I'M PROBABLY UNDER UTILIZES I KDOW I ACTUALLY THATS AN OVER STATEMENT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IM DON'T APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF OF THIS APPROACH TO PARENTING IM AND I AM TRYING TO DO IT MORE OFTEN SO I'M QUICK QUICK STORY IN THAT IILL BACK UP INTO THE PRINCIPLE SO I WAS I WAS GETTING READY TO GETE MY FIRST HEAD TALK A NUMBER YEARS AGO EXTREMELY NERVOUS I'M I'M A SHY INTRVERT I WAS FOR A LONG TIME AFRAID OF PUBLIC SPEAKING I REMEMBERING COLLEGE LITERALLY SHAKING I'M TO RAISE MY HAND  BEING THAT NERVOUS AND NOW I' FELT TO GET IN THE RED CIRCLE I'M NOT MY IDEA OF COMFORTS ON AND HAPPEN TO MENTION TO OUR OLDEST DAUGHTER THAT I WAS NERVOUS AND I ASKED HER FOR ADVICE ON WHAT I SHOULD DO AND SHE SAID I THINK I THINK AT THE TIME LU SEE SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SHE WAS SEVEN MAYBE THINK SEVEN I MAYBE SIX AND NIT I'M SHE SAID I LOOK FOR A SMILING FACE IN THE AUDIENCE SO IT IT WAS IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS RELING OH THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA I'M WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT YES I CAN DO THAT I KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE CN BE IN THE AUDIENCE SO I ASKED A COUPLE OF FRIENDS TO SIT IN THE FRONT ROWS AND I I LOCKED EYES WITH A COUPLE OF THEM AND MY NERVES WENT DOWN A LITTLE BIT SO COUPLE WEEKS LATER I'M JOANNA'S GETTING READY TO BE IN A SCHOOL PLAY AND SHE'S ALSO SHY AND INTERVERTED AND SHE'S NERVOUS AND SHE ASKED US FOR ADVICE AND INSTEAD OF TELLING HER WHAT TO DO I SAID WELL WHAT DID YOU SUGGEST TO ME A FEW WEEKS AGO AND SHE SHE REMEMBERED AND SHE SAID LOOK FOR A SMILING FACE AND IT WAS IT WAS ONE OF LIKE THE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST MOVING MOMENTS I'M OF MY LIFE IKE ALLISON AND I GOT TO THE PLAY AND SHE LOOKED AT US AND SHE BEAMED AND I JUST AM I I THINK WHAT ID LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE WAS KIDS NEED TO FEEL THAT THEY MATTER AND MOST OF US THINK ABOUT MATTERING AS A YOU KNOW SHOWING KIDS THAT THEY'RE UNCONDITIONALLY LOVED AND GIVING THEM THE SUPPORT THEY NEED BUT WE FORGET THAT PART OF FEELING THT YOU MATTERIS FEELING THAT YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO AS A KID FEELING LIKE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE AS A PARENT ASKING MY DAUGHTER FOR ADVICE THAT BOOSTED HER CONFIDENCE AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A I'VE COME TO CALL THIS THE COACH EFFECT AT'S WHEN MY FAVOURITE RECENT FINDINGS AND PSYCHOLOGY THAT WHEN WHEN YOUR STRUGGLING WITH SOMETHING A YOUR INSTINCT IS TO GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE FOR ADVICE AND SAY I NEED GUIDANCE THE PROBLEM IS THAT KEEPS YOU IN A PASSIVE FRAME OF MIND IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR DEPENDENT ON OTHERS WHAT YOU'RE BETTER OFF DOING IS FINDING SOMEBODY ELSE WITH A SIMILAR CHALLENGE AND GIVING THEM ADVICE AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT IT SHOWS YOU THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO GIVE A ITBOS YOUR EFFICACY A THE RESEARCH ON THIS BY LEARN ESCRIS WINKLER AND COLLEAGUES IS FASCINATING SO PEOPLE WHO GIVE ADVICE INSTEAD OF RECEIVING IT IRANDOMLY ASSIGNED AND AA MORE MOTIVATED AND MORE CONFIDENT AAND I THINK THIS IS OMING EVERY PARENT CULD DO I WHATEVER CHALLENGE YOU THINK YOUR KID IS IN A FACE FIND AVERSION OF IT THAT YOUR GRAPPLING WITH AND SEEK THEIR GUIDANCE ON IT AND WHEN THEY RUN INTO THAT SAME CHALLENGE THEY WILL HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO FIGURE IT OUT ON THEIR OWN AND YOU CAN BE A COACH IN THAT PROCESS IS OPPOSED TO JUST TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO WHICH THEY MAY FEEL LIKE IS NOT RELEVANT OR THEY MAY RESIST BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO BY APPARENT SO THAT IS MY FAVORITE PARENTING LESSON FROM IT INPOTENTIAL I LOVE THAT AND I LOVE YOUR STATEMENT THAT YOU KNOW KIDS LIKE ADULT WANT OF MATTER YOU KNOW THAT BEING YOU KNOW WEKER YOU DON'T MAKE THEM FEEL IMPORTANT BUT SO OFTEN THAT'S TIED TO PERFORMANCE MATTRICS AND THES PERFORMANCE MATRICS ARE THE VERY THINGS THAT ARE MAKING THEM NERVOUS OR THAT OR CREATING ANXIETY UM I LOF IT UM ARE YOU TAKING ADDITIONAL KITS FOR ADOPTION  I RN RAISAN RASON RAISING MY HAND I THA GOOD BE A LOT MY DEVELOPMENT AL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN THE WORLD IF FAT IF WES CHAISE OUR CAREERS LATER SUPERINTERESTING TOP AGAIN BY THE WAY I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO READING YOUR BOOK A HIDDEN POTENTIAL IM CLEARLY I HAVE A LOT TO RESOLVE AROUND THAT ISSUE BECAUSE A I STILL HEAR MISS ROLFIN THE IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL JUST TELLING ME HOW MUCH POTENTIAL WE HAVE AND THAT UM AND THEN I WASN'T ACCESSING MINE OH N ITS AY LIKE A VOICE IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD UM ALL THE TIME AND UM EVEN TOUGH I FEEL VERY HAPPY WITH UM A MANY ASPECTS OF MY LIFE THAT THEREARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WANT TO DO THAT I HAVEN'T DONE AND I THINK IT'S THROUGH A I YOU KNOW LIMIT LIMITED A WHAT RE THEY CALL LIMITING SELF BELIEFS OR THINGS OF THAT SO OR IIT ANRY ELSE

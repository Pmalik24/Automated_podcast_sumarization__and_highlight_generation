ALSTERS SINCE COMAS WAS TEALING LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND USING IT TO BUILD TERROR TUNNELS AND ROCKETS AND THEY WERE KILLING ANYONE WHO OPPOSE THEM THE GOAL ISN'T EVEN TO MAKE A POLITICAL POINT REALLY POLITICIANS MAY TRY TO TRANSLATE THE OBVIOUSLY PRO TERRORISM IN ANTISMETIC MESSAGES OF THESE PROCOMAS PROTEST INTO POLITICAL SPEAK HY TRY TO MAKE IT ABOUT A SEASE FIRE OR NEGOTIATIONS OR TWO STATE SOLUTION BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THESE PROTESTS ARE ABOUT THESE PROTESTS ARE ABOUT INTIMIDATION IT IS THAT SIMPLE THE SIZE AND VIRULANTS OF THE PROTEST IS DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE THIS IS WHY THE

PICTURES OF SOME OF THOSE STRINGERS CARRYING GRINADES TO THE ACTUAL ATTACKS MUSTN'T UPSET THE ASLOMIC RADICALS AND THE ALOMOGRATICALS KNOW THAT THE SPINELESS MEDIA WILL CAVE TO THEIR EMANDS THAT'S WHY

PROV DA IS TWO PRO AMERICAN NOW THE PROTESTORS KNOW THAT TEY'RE NOT ALL THE WAYS STUPID TH A PURPOSE OF THEIR MANY RIOT WAS SIMPLE KEEP THE EW YORK TIMES INTIMIDATED BELIEVING THAT THE ANGER THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING MUST BE THE RESULT OF SOME SORT OF OPPRESSION AGAIN THAT'S HOW ORKS IN THE MEDIA THE ANGRIER THE SUPPOSEDLY OPPRESSD PERCEEN THE MORE THEY DESERVE YOUR ACQUIESCENCE AND SURRENDER INTIMIDATION DOES WORK ALL OF THIS IS REMINISCENCE OF THE SHARLEY HEBDOS SCANDAL OF TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN THAT PUBLICATION PRINTED A CARTOON OF MOHAMMED THE PROFIT SAYING QUOTE IT'S HARD BEING LOVE BY JERKS AMID THE MASSIVE PROTESTS FRENCH PRESIDENT JONK SHIRACH CONDEMNED THE MAGAZINE FOR QUO OVERT PROVOCATIONS WELL YOU KNOWT THAT SPERD A BUNCH OF TERRORISM AGAINST CHARLEY HABDOH IN TO THOUSAND

INCREASINGLY VIOLENT ATTACKS ON JEWES INTERNATIONALLY IT'S WHY THRE IS AN ATTEMPTED SHOOTING AT A MONTREALL JEWISH SCHOOL YESTERDAY SO WHAT SHOULD THE WEST DO THE ANSWER IS TO BE UNINTIMIDATED DO NOT CAVE IN TO THE RATICALS IF THEY GET AGGRESSIVE THEY SHOULD BE CONFRONTED IF THEY GET VIOLENS THEY SHOULD BE ARRESTED BY LAW INFORCEMEN THAT IS LITERALLY THE JOB OF LAW INFORCEMEN IF THEY ARE NOT CITIZENS AND THY SUPPORT HOMASS THEY SHOULD BE DEPORTED TO COUNTRIES THAT BETTER REFLECT THEI'R AWFUL VALUES NO MORE WEAKNESS UNLESS YOU WANT MORE TERRORIS MORE TERRO SUPPORTERS AND MORE DEAD INNOCENCE HAIN JUST ONE SECOND WE ARE GOING TO GET TO THE WEST CONTINUING TO START TO CAVE BECAUSE AGAIN THE OPPRESSOR OPPRESS MATRICKS IS THE DEATH OF THE WEST IT IS THET ETHEWESS WILL GETS THAT ONE

THINKG ABOT THIS THOU US MILITARY IS MADE UP OF ONE HUNDRED PERCENT VOLUNTEERS THESE ARE MEN AND WOME WHO WILLINGLY SACRIFICE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE FOR THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY'RE UNSERVING THEY'RE TURN HOME TO A TIGHT CHOB MARKET AND OUTRAGEOUS LIVING EXPENSES THAT'S WHY I'M SO HAPPY THAT THERE IS A PRIVATE COMPANY LIKE PURTOLK THAT IS JUMPED INTO HELP WHEN YOU SWITCH TO PURTOCK'S LIGHTNING FAST FIVE TOU NETWORK THEY'LL DON'T ITE A PORTION OF EVERY NEW ORDER TOO THIS EXCELLENT CAUSE THE CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE JUST BY CHOOSING SUPERIOR SELLPHON SERVICE AND AGAIN I USE PURETAK SO I KNOW HOW

THE WEST IS BEING MADE APPARENT PRETTY MUCH EVERY SINGLE DAY ALL ALL THESE TALKS ABOUT HOW ISRAEL THESE MORE HUMANITARIAM PLUSES THEY NEED A SEASE FIRE MORCUMAN ATTEMPCAS SECURES THE THING ISRAEL RIGHT NOW BY THE AVILABLE DATA IS BEING MORE TARGEDED IN AN URBAN AREA THAN LITERALLY ANY ARMY IN HUMAN HISTORY THE ACTUAL RATIO OF TERERIS KILLED TO INNOCENCE KILLED I'S PROBABLY ABOUT ONE TO ONE AND THAT'S AWFUL THAT'S TERRIBLE IT'S ALSO ENTIRELY BECAUSE COMMASSES STRATEGY ISTO HIDE BEHIND CIVILIANS KNOWING THAT IF THEYN GET THE MEDIA ON THEIR SAIDE THAT IF THEY GET THE LEFTESE ON THEIR SIDE IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE ANGER IN THE STREETS THAT THERE'LL BE AN ATTEMPT TO CALL OFF THE DOGS THER'LL BE AN ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE COMMASS IN ITS POSITION OF POWER THAT IS THE GOAL HERE AND AGAIN THEY THE THE GOAL IS TO INTIMIDATE THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE SEEN A WIDE SPREAD MEDIA ATTEMPT TO PIN JO BIDONS PERSONAL UNPOPULARITY ON HIS UPPORT FOR ISRAEL BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE THE DATA ARE THE REALITY IS THAT BIDON SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IS QUITE POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT SUPPORT COMMASS THE REALITY IS THAT BY EIGHTY FOR TO SIXTEEN PER CENT IN THE LATEST HARVARD CAP TERISPOL AMERICAN SUPPORT ISRAEL OVERCOMEOSS AND JUST AS MANY BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL IS JUSTIFIED IN ITS RESPONSE THI TO SAY PECE WRITTEN BY MARK PEN AT THE WALSZR JURNAL HE'S A POLSTER AN ADVISER TO BILL IN HILLRY CLINTON SO THE'S NOT COMING FROM REPUBLICAN WHO WISHES TO SEE JOBN WIN IS COMING FROM A DEMOCRAT WHO WISHES TO SEE JOBIDON WIN ACCORDING TOO MARK PEN HE SAYS IT'S TRUE THAT THE SIXTEEN PER CENT WHO SUPPORT COMAS INCLUDE MANY DEMOCRATS AS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOYROLDS SPLIT ONLY FIFTY TWO TO FORTY EIGHT IN ISRAEL'S FAVOR BUT ARE THOSE DEMOCRATS GOING TO VOTE FOR DONAL TRUMP WHO MOVE THE YOS EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IN THE END THEY WILL COME HOME AS THEY ALWAYS DO BRINGING HOME SWING VOTERS WILL TAKE MORE THAN ISRAEL POLICY ISRAEL RANKS SEVENTH AMONG THE ISSUES OF CHIEF CONCERN TO AMERICAN VOTERS IF JOBIDON CAN MAC PROGRESS ON THE OTHER PRIORITIES HE'S REDUCED TO RUNNING A NEGATIVE CAMPAGN AGAINST TRUMP BUT THE REALITY IS THAT JOBIDON'S ISRAEL POSITION IS ACTUALLY WIDELY POPULAR THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SEEING THESE PROTESTS GROW IN SIZE IN VIRULENCE AS THEY ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE JOBIDON THAT IF HE DOESN'T PUSH ISRAEL OFF THE MARK THN THEY WILL SOMEHOW LEAD TO HIS DEFEAT DEZWISU RECHUETED TO LEAD THREATENING THAT HER FOLLOWERS ARN'T CAN VOTE FOR BIDON AGAIN MARK PEN IS CORRACK WHERE THEY NDEVIL FOR TRUMP FROMIS MOST PRO ISRAEL PRESENT I AMERICAN HISTORY BAR NON THIS IS WHY YOU SEE JO BIDONS STAFFERS WEAKING ROUTINELY TO THE MEDIA AN ATTEMPT TO UNDER CUT HIM IN THE YORK TIMES TODAY REMEMBER THIS THE YOR TIMES WE SHOULD REMEMBER A CORTING TWO ALL OF THESES PROTESTERS ZAPRO ISRAEL NEWSPAPER WHICH GAIN INSANE SO THEY PRINTED A STORY TO DAY CALLED IS RALLY FORCES HAVE LIMITED TIME AN GOSA YOURS OFFICIAL SAY WHO ARD THESE PEOPLE QUOTE AS SENIOR BIDIN OFFICIALS PUSH ISRAEL TO DO MORTEM IN MY CIVILLIN CASUALTIES GENERAL CHARLES CUE BROWN JUNIOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF SET ON WEDNESDAY HE WAS WORRIED EACH CIVILIAN KILLDING GOZA COULD GENERATE FUTURE MEMBERS OF COMMHOS WHICH BY THE WAY THIS IS THE DUMMIST ARGUMENT TYOU EVER HERE IT'S REALLY A STUPID ARGUMENT THAT THAT IS THE SAME ARGUMENT AS OMY GASHIUNA DURING RELD WAR TO IF WE KILLED TO MANIANATSES AND TO MENYS VILLINS GET KILLED WAL WERE KILLING ANAZIS WERE JUST GOIN TO CREATE NEW NATSIES IT'S THE MOST SELF SERVING CATCH TRYING TO ARGUMENT OF ALL TIME THANY ONE WORRY ABOUT THE WHEN WE ARE KILLING EVERYONE ICISRAEL ALMAGOSH IF WE KILLE TO MANY MEMBERS OF ISIS YUNOMY PEOPLE IT'S GON ARADICALIS MILLIONS PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD WOULD BE RADICALIZED BY IS TAKING OUT ISIS THAT IS NOT THE WAY THIS WORKS AGAIN WHAT CREATES TERRIS IS HOPE OF DEFEATING THE WEST THAT IS WHY THEY MULTIPLY WHEN YOU THINK THAT A MOVEMENT IS GOING TO LOSE YOU TYPICALLY DON'T JOIN THE MOVEMENT BUT ACCORDING TO THE NEAR TIMES GENERAL BROWNS COMMENTS OFFERED A RARE GLIMPSE OF DIVISION BETWEEN ISRAEL AN THE BID ADMINISTRATION IT CAME AS THE UNITED NATION SECRETARY GENERAL ANTONIAL GUTTETTAS SED THE NUMBER OF CIVILIANS KILLED IN THE GOSESTRIP SHOWED HIM THERE IS SOMETHING CLEARLY WRONG WITH ISRAEL'S MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST COMAS NOW AGAIN THESE STAFFS THAT ARE COMING OUT FROM THE GOSESTRIP ARE SOLELY FROM COMMAS COMMAS LIES ABOUT THE STUFF ALL THE TIME THEY LABEL CMAS TERRORIS AS CIVILIANS ALL THE TIME VERY OFTEN YOU'LL SEE A STACOMOUS LIK EIGHTY PEOPLE KILLED SEVENTY OF THEM CIVILLINGS AND IT TURNS OUT SEVENTY THEMERTERIS AND TEN OF THEM WERE CIVILIANS BECAUE IT''S JUST A GUY WHO'S EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WITH A GON BUT HE WAS ACTUALL US RORRING GENES AND TEECHERK IS NOT UNIFORM ACCORDING TO THE NERR TIMES HOWEVER THE LEVEL OF CARNET HAS DEEPLY SHAKEN ISRAEL AND SHIPED ITS MILITARY RESPONSE THE LONGER THE IS RALLY MILITARY CAMPAGN CONTINUES THE GREATER THE CHANCE THE CONFLICT WILL SPARK A WIDER WAR SEVERAL OFFICIALS IN THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION SIDE THAT OF COURSE IS AGAIN A LAHI ACTUALLY IF ISRAEL RADICALLY ASCALLATES AND STARTS GOING WHOLEHOG JUST O GET THIS THING DONE WITH THAT ESCALLATES THE CHANCES OF A HARSH RESPONSE THES BEEN LOW LEVEL CONFLICT IN TE MIDALIES FOR LITERALLY MY LIFE TIME MY PARENTS LIFETIME AS LONG ISRAEL'S BEEN AROUND THE ONLY TIMES IT IS BROKEN INTO WAR IS WHEN THERE IS AN OVERT FEELING THE ISRAEL CAN BE OVERCOME IT'S THE BIDAD MINISTRATION AGAIN IS GOING WOBLY THAT IS NOT PARTICULA SHOCK AND THAT IS DUE ONCE AGAIN TWO ALL OF THE PUBLIC PRESSURE THIT'S BEING BROUGHT TO BEAR BY PROCOMAS PROTESTORS AND THEIR ALLIES IN THE MEDIA THIS PRESUMABLY IS WHY TRO BIDNANS OUT THEY'RE SAYING I'VE BEEN ASKING ISRAEL FOR LONGER PAUSES FOR HUMANITARY CAUSES ISRAEL IS LITERALLY TAKING MULTIPLE OUR GAPS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THERE'S LOT'S O TAPE OF THIS AND THERE ARE GARDINGS CIVILIAN CORRIDORS IS O COMASCARDING THE CIVILIANS IT'S ISRAEL SPENDING ITS OWN BLOOD AN TRESSURE TO GUARD CIVILIAN CORRIDORS STHET PALISINIANS CAN WALK FROM THE AREAS THAT ISRAEL IS TARGETING AWAY FROM THOSE AREAS ANTOWN SOUT ISRAEL HAS NOW SET UP A FIELD H HOSPITAL FOUR PALISTINIAN ARABS ON THE BEACH IN GAZA WHY BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE GONE THERE CAN AVE TO GOING TO ALL SHIEFUK AS ALL SHEF A HOSPITAL HAS BEEN CAMSES MILITARY HEADQUARTERS FOR LITERALLY TO DECADES WHEN THEY DO THAT THER 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE SICK PATIEONTS FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER COME OSS MEANWHILE ISU'S WAITIG FOR ISRAEL TO KILLDEMS THAT CAN BRAGS THE CAMERAS ABOUT IT BUT HERE IS JOBIDON DOING THIS SILLY ROUTINE ABOUT HOW ISRAEL MEADS LONG OR HUMANITARIAN PAUSES O A BUT IF COMMOSS IS NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO RELEASE THE HOSTAGES THAT'S JUST ALLOWING THEM TIME TO REGROUP AND RE ARM THE ONLY REASON HE'S DOING THIS IS ONCE AGAIN THE BY ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO PLAY IT BOTH SIDES THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY YOW WERE PROISRAEL YAWERBACK AND INS TRUE THEY ARE ND AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDER CUTTING THAT BY CLAIMING THAT ISRAEL IS VIOLATING HUMAN RETRICHS NOT TRUE BY CLAIMING THAT ISRAEL NEADS TO DO MORE TO PROTECT CIVILLIONS EVENOL ISRAEL IS DOING MORE MILITARILY TO PROTECT CIVILLIANS THAN ANY ARMY IN HISTORY INCLUDING THE AMERICAN ARMY IN PLACES LIKE A ROCK OR AFT GANNISTAN AGAIN ALL OF THIS UNDER COTES IT IT ACTUALLY UNDERCUTS THE ABILITY OF ISRAEL TO FINISH OFF THE BAG GIES NOW

BECAUSE SOME OF THE PEOPLE GON TO SHOW UP TO COUNS ER PROTEST ARE OUR PEOPLE WHERE A TEMPTING TO PROTECT THOSE MONUMENTS WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO'S COME UNDER FIRE IS SWELLA BRAVERMAN SHE'S THE HOME SECRETARY SHE SHE'S EXCELLENT SWELLA BRAVER MIN BYTHE WAY ANUEN SHE GAVE A SPEECH AT A I RECENTLY ALL ABOUT ALL ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE WEST TO TAKE STOCK OF THE PEOPLE ENTERING THE COUNTRY SHE'S TOTALLY RIGHT ABOUT THUS WELL NOW SHEIS UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE RESHI SOUNAC IS THINKING ABOUT MAYBE DUMPING HER SHE WROTE AN ARTICLE ACCUSING POLICE OF BYAS AND ALLOWING THE PROCOMAS PROTESTS SHE CLAIMD THAT SOME SENIOR OFFICERS APPARENTLY PLAY FAVORITES ANDAPPARENTLY THE PRIME MINISTER DIDN'T SIGN OFF ON ALL OF THAT DOWNING STREET SAYS IT IS STILL INVESTIGATING HOW THE ARTICLE CONTAINING IN FLAMITORY COMPARISON BETWEEN PRO PALISINIAN MOBS AND MARCHES IN NORTHERN IRELAND WAS SENT TO THE TIMES FOR PUBLICATION SUNAC IS NOT FIRING HER YET SHE CLAIM THAT MOB PROTESTOS WERE LARGELY IGNORE BY OFFICERS EVEN WONE CLEARLY BREAKING THE WALL THAT IS ONE HUNDRED PRECENTRU AND YOU CAN SEE IT HAPPENING IN REAL TIME AND WE HAVE TAPE OF IT WE HAVE PROTESTORS LITERALLY FIRING FIREWORKS AT OFFICERS IN LONDON AND THE OFFICERS DOING NOTHING AND MEANWHILE TELLING PEOPLE WHO ARE HOLDING BRITISH LACK THEY CAN'T PUT THE BRITISH FLAGS RIGHT THERE WE HAVE VIDIO OF POLICE OFFICERS IN LONDON A RESTING PEOPLE FOR SAYING THE PROCAMOSNIC SHOULD BE DEPORTED AND MEANWHILE YOU HAVE PROCOMAS PROTESTERS WCHO ARE INTIMIDATING BREAKING WINDOWS DOING WHAT THEY DO SO NATURALLY ALL OF THE CONTROVERSY'S ABOUT SWELL A

A BRAVERMAN AFTER SHE DEFIE DOWNING STREET BY PUBLISHINGAN ARTICLE ACCUSING THOSE POLICE OFFICERS A BYAS OVER PROTEST IN SUPPORT A PALISTINE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PROTESTS ARE ABOUT MY FRIEND DOUGLAS MURRY IS POINTED THES OUT IF YOUCTUALLY LOOK AT THE TAPE OF THE PROTEST THIS IS NOT A QUOTTIN PRO PALISTINE PROTEST IT IS A PRO COMOSS PROTEST THAT'S WHY THEY WEREN'T PROTESTING AGAINST COMASS FIVE MINUTES AGO EVERY ONE UNDERSTANDS THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE AN ADVOCATE OF THE TWO STATE SOLUTION WHICH GET HIS FANTASY LAND TGIVEN THE FACT THAT THE PALISTINIANS THEMSELVES ARE INCREDIBLY RATICLISES N HAVE NO DESIRE FOR TO STATE SOLUTION BUT EVEN IF YOUR FAND YOU WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF COMOS BEING GOTT IN RID OF BUT NOBODY IS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT GETTNG RID OF COMASS SO ID IS VERY VERY LIKELY ACTUALLY THAT THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF CONFLICT THE ROYAL BRITISH LEGION HAS DEFENDED PRO PALISTINIAN DEMONSTRATORS RIGHT TO PROTESTOMEN A FURIOUS ROW OVER WHETHER A RALLY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO AHEAD ON ARMIS TO SAY THE ROYALBRISH LEGION HAS URGED PROTESTERS TO BE PEACEFUL AND SHOW RESPECT AS MORNER'S FLOCK TO LONDON THIS WE CAN TO REMEMBER WAR DEAD IN A STATEMENT THE ARM FORCES CHARITIES AT THE BRITISH ARM FORCE TO PLAY VITAL RULE AND PROTECTING THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF EVERYONE NEWCASE SOCIETY INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PROTEST WHE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY PROTEST DURING THE ARBIALL REMEMBRANCE VENTS WE HOPE EVENTS CAN GO AHEAD OVER THE WE CAN WITHOUT DISRUPTION YAT WE'LL SEE YAT WE'LL SEE APPARENTLY THE LATEST PROKOMSS MARCH THROUGH LONDON IS DUE TO TAKE PLACE NOT ONLY TOMORROW BUT THEY'VE NOW MAPPED OUT WERE EXACTLY THEYRE GOING THE SIX ORGANIZING GROUPS BEHIND THE DEMONSTRATION HAD FACED CALLS FROM THE AT POLICE TO POSTPONE THEI'RE MARCH ON THE GROUNDS THAT WOULD CLASH WITH REMEMBRANCE SERVICES SO FIRST OF ALL IF YOU HAVE A MARCH THAT YOU KNOW IS GOING TO CLASH WITH THE REMEMBRANCE SERVICE FOR FALLEN SOLDIERS IN THE UK THAT SHOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE MARCHERS THAT SHOULD SAY SOMETHNG ABOUT THE MARCHERS IF THEY'RE MARCHING FOR PIECE AND LOVE THERE'D BE NO CLASH WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO'RE MARCHING TO REMEMBER WAR DEAD TIT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THE ORIENTATION OF MANY OF THESE MARCHERS THE MET'S COMMISSIONERS TOR ARK RALLY ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO GIVE THE MARCH A GREEN LIGHT THE LOSCRD BY PARLIAMENT ARE CLEAR THERE'S ABSOLY NO POWERED BAM PROTEST SAID SERMARK HE ADDED THE MARCHERS HAD SHOWN A COMPLETE WILLINGNESS TO STAY AWAGY FROM THE SENETAF AND WHITEHALL AND HAVE NO INTENTION OF DISRUPTING THE NATIONS REMEMBRANCE EVENTE AHEH WE WILL SEE IF IT GOES QUITE AS THEY THINK IT IS GOING TO GO MEANWHILE REN LAPEN OVER IN FRANCE I'S BEGINNING TO GAIN MORE SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THIST THE SIMPLE FACTS TH MATTER IS THAT FRANCE WHICH HAS AN EXTREMELY LARGE MUSLIN POPULATION THEY THE MUSLIN POPULATION OF FRANCE RIGHT NOW 'S ABOUT THREE POINT FOR MILLION MUSLIMS ISABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION PEW RESEARCH CENTER PREDICT THAT THE MUSLIN POPULATIONWAL RISE TO BETWEEN EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION WHIC IS ABOUT LIKE TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY IN TWENTY FIFTY THIS ONE OF THE GROLLING THRATS THAT PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVING BECAUSE AGAIN THEY'RE IN TIRE DISTRICTS OF PARIS THAT AGAIN IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY BUT ITS REALITIES ARE NO GOZONES PEOPLE LEAVE THEM ALONE THE POLICE DO NOT WANT TO GO IN THERE THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN ARES OF LONDON BY THE WAY THERE CERTAIN PRECINCTS WHER HE POLICE JUST DO NOT WANT TO GO IN FACT UNDER THE HIGHMAGRATION  SENARIA THAT PEW RESEARCH ESTIMATES THEY SAY THAT THE PER CENT HUREWOUL BE THE PERCENTAGE OF MUSLINS IN THE E U BY TW ENTY FIFTY  UNDER A HIGH MIGRATION SINARIO THORITY PER CENT OF SWEDEN SEVENTEEN PER CENT OF NORWAY FIFTEEN PER CENT OF FINLAN TWENTY PER CENT OF GERMANY EIGHTEEN PER CENT OF FRANTS TWENTY PER CENT OF AUSTRIA SEVENTEEN PER CENT OF THE UCA AT THOSE ARE VERY VERY HIGH NUMBERS BECAUSE AGAIN A HUGE PER CENTAGE OF THIS POPULATION AS WE ARE SEEING FROM THSE PROTUS RT NOW IS NOT IN FACT ASSIMILATING TO WESTERN VALLUES EVEN UNDER A LOWER ESTIMATE THOSE ARE BIG BIG NUMBERS AND SO THE BLOWBACK HAS BEGUN ND YOUR STARTING TO SEE RIGHTWING PARTIES WHO ARE GAINING CREDIBILITY BECAUSE OF THIS SO MARINLA PEN WHO IS THE THE LEADER OF THE NATIONAL RALLY PARTY ORIGINALLY FOUNDED BY HER FATHER SCHOLMARILA PEN CHOLMARIE WAS A PRETTY VICIOUS ANTISEMIC MARINE HAS NOT BEEN AT LEAST AN IN POLICE OR PRACTICE AND SO MARINE IS TRYING TO NOW JOIN SHE SHO AGAIN WAS IN A RUN OFF FOR THE FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COUNTRY IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE AND SHE IS NOW JOINING IN AN ANTI ANTISEMATISMRALLILIC TO FIGHT ANTISEMATISM BECAUSE THE CASE THET SHE IS MAKING IS THAT FRANE IS IMPORTED TOO MANY RADICAL MUSLIMS WHICH OF COURSE ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO BE TRUE A

TDEVOTED MOST FOR DONAL TRUMP IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCHLEL YESTERDAY MANSION SAID HET DO NOT RUN FOR ANOTHER TERM IN WEST VIRGINIA HES SEVENTY SIX YEARS OLD BUT THAT'S N'T MEANTHAT HIS POLITICAL CARERS OVERS WELL SEE HE MAY EVEN POSE MOROFA THREAT TWO JOBIDON THEN JUST THAT HIS TURM ENDS GJANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH MEANS OF COURSE THAT HE IS GOING TO HIS SEAT WILL BE UP FOR ELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HURE Y WATS IN NOUNCING YESTERDAY THEY WOULD NOT BE RUNNING FOR REELECTION IN THE STATE AFTER MONTHS OF DE LIBERATION AND LONG CONVERSATION OF MY FAMILY I BELIEVE IN MY HEART OF HEARTS THAT I'VE ACCOMPLISH THIZE SET OUT TO DO FOR WEST VIRGINIA I'VE MADE ONE THE TOMPLIS DECISIONS OF MY LIFE AND DECIDED I WILL NOT BE RUNNING FOR REELECTION TO UNITE ESTATE SENATE BUT WHAT I WILL BE DOIN IS TRAVELLING THE COUNTRY AND SPEAKING OUT TO SEE IF THEREISNAN INTEREST IN CREATING A MOVEMENT TO MOBILIZE THE MIDDLE AND BRING AMERICANS TOGETHER TO THE WEST VIRGINIAS WHOAVE PUT THEIR TRUST IN ME AND TOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE TO MAKE OUR STATE BETTER IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR OF MY LIFE TO SERVYOU THANK YOU CAY SO MANSION OUT IN WEST VIRGINIA WHAT'S THAT MEMEANS REPUBLICANS PICK UP ONE SEAT REMEMBER HES SENATE RIGHT NOW IS SPLIT FIXTY ON FORTY NON DEMOCRATS TO REPUBLICANS SO THAT'S HE FLITS N OW GOUT FIFTY FIFTYS THAT MEANS PUBLIC THAT'S PICK UP ONE MORE SEAT NOW HERE IS THE THING THERE ARE ZURO REPUBLICAN SENATORS FACING REELECTION IN PURPLE STATES IN STATES THAT TRUMP LOST IN EITHER OF ELAST TO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THERE ARE SIX TDEMOCRAT SENATORS WORE FACING REELECTION STATES IN STATES THAT TRUMP ONE IN AT LEAST TWENTY SIXTEEN OR TWNTY TWENTY SEN PURPLE STATES SIX SENATORS UP ZERO REPUBLICANS ALL DEMOCRATS RITE SIX AT SIXLO SENATORS ARE DEMOCRATS SO WHAT EXACTLY TO OSE RACES LOOK LIKE OR THEY LOOK UNLESS REPUBLICANS BOLOT WHICH REPUBLICANS HAVE A MAGICAL WAY OF DOING I MEAN IT TO IT I HAVE TO SAY AM ASTONISHED T THE UNBROKEN CHAIN OF REPUBLICAN FAILURE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SIX YEARS OR SO IN ARIZONA PURSTON SENTIMA ANNOUNCE THAT SHE WAS GON TO RUN ASN'T INDEPENDENT THAT IS BEC OS THE DEMOCRTIC PARTY BASELY UNDER CUT HER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAKING TOO MANY DEALS WITH THE OTHER SIDE HAVING TOO MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH MIT ROMNY AND THE LIKE WHILE THAT HAS NOW OPENED UP A THREE WAY RACE BETWEEN CRSTON SON MUT IS INDEPENDENT RUBIN GYAGO AS DEMOCRAT AND CARY LAKE PRESUMABLY AS THE SENATE OPPONENT IN ARIZONA NOW CARRY LAKE JUST LOST THE GUBENATORIAL RACE OVER THERE IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT SHE OULD EVEN LOSE IN A THREE WAY RACE THAT SENIMA WOULD PICK UP SOME F HE MODERATE RE PUBLICANS AND THAT SHE PICK UP SOMEO THE MODERATE DEMOCRATS AND THAT SHE LOSIS BUTKE GAYAGO SOMEHOW SNEAKSON THAT' CAN BE OF VERY HOTLY FOUGHT RACE AN UNCOMFORTABLE ONE F REPUBLICANS BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE DECIDED N T ARIZONA TO SJUST MORE COWBELL IS THE SOLUTION APPARENTLY MEANWHILE OVER IN MICHIGAN DEMOCRATS HAVE A SEAT IS BEEN VACATED BY DEBY STABNA SHE'S ANNOUNCED HER ATIREMENT SHE'S REELECTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH FIFTY TWO POIN THREE PER CENT OF THE VOTE DEPENDING ON WHO REPUBLICANS NOMINATE MICHIGAN AND THE MORBAN STATE OF TE MICHIGAN REPUBLICAN PARTY THEY COULD THEORETICALLY WHEN A SEAT THERE IS CON BE DIFFICULT MICHIGAN OF THE MICHIGAN REPUBLICAN PARTY IS CURRENTLY BANKRUPT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ABILITY TO TAKE OUT AT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND NOT ONLY THAT THEY'VE HAD A HISTORY OF NOMINTING CANDIDATES JUST WILDLY UNDER PERFORM IN GENERAL ELECTIONS BUT THAT'S ONLY TWO STATES THERE THE OTHER STATES MONTANA IS A TRADITIONALLY RED STATE JOHN TESTER IS SECKING REELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HE WANT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH FIFTY POINT THREE PER CENT OF THE VOTE BUT HE'S GOING TO BE ON THE BALLAT PRESUMABLY AT THE SAME TIME AS TRUMP IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DO RING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS DEMOCRAT N REPUBLICAN STATE NOT QUITE THE SAME THING AS RUNNING AT THE SAME TIME IS REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO IN MONTANA SHOULD HAVE SOME COT TAILS TO CULD EASILY SHE REPUBLICANS PICKIN UP THATSY SO THAT WOULD GIVE REPUBLICANS A FIFTY ONE FORTY UNINE MAJORITY IN OHIO OHIO STOLLA SWING STATE KANDES SORTA BUT OHIO IS DEEPLY RED TRUMP ON THE STATE WIDELY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWNTY TWENTY SHERD BROWN IS LOOKING FOR REELECTION HE WON IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH FIFTY THREE POIN FOURE PER CENT OF THE VOTE SO SHARD BROWN IS A MUCH MORE FORMIDABLE CANDIDATE THAN POBLY JOHN TESTER IS IN MONTANA HOWEVER IS THAT A SEAT THE REPUBLICANS COULD WIN IF THEY DON'T RUN SOMEBODY TERRIBLE SURE THAT IS DEFINITELY WENABLE SEAT AGAIN ATS CAN BE A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICANS LOOK LIKE THE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO RUN SOMEBODY GOOD THIS TIME THAT PRESUMABLY WOULD BE DAVE MACORMIC WHOS RUNNING FOR THE SENATE IN PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRATIC SENT REBOBCASY IS LOOKING FROR FOURTH TERM HE'S REELECTED BY WIDE MARCHIN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT THE STATE SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN CLOSER ALONG THESE LINES AT MACCORMIC IS GOOD CANDIDATE IN WISCONSIN SENER  TAMMY BAUBLINS UP FOR REELECTION AGAINS SHE ONE WIDELY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE QUESTION IS TO WHETHE REPUBLICANS WILL SELECT SOMEBODY WHO IS  SORT OF MORE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD MISCONSIN OR TO WIN THE SEATS OR WERE THEY GET OUT THE VOTE IN WHY MARCHIN IN TWENTY FOUR IS ROR TH QUESTION SO TRUMPS CAN HAVE T AVE COTAILS OF TRUMP HAS EVEN IF TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE CLOTELLS REPUBLICANS HAVE A VERY GOOD CHID OF RETAINING THE SENATE HOWEVER IF TRUMP DOES HAVE COTTAILS REPUBLICANS COULD THEORETICALLY WALK AWAY WITH FIFTY THREE FIFTY FOUR SEATS IN THE UNITED STATE SENATE SO THAT'S THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT'S VERY BAD FOR JOBIDEN IN TH DEMOCRATS OBVIOUSLY BUT JOMANSION RETIRING F OM THE SENATE IN WEST VIRGINIA GIVING UP HIS SEAT PRESUMABLY TO MAY BE GOVERNOR JIM JUST ISS O RE PUBLICANE AS NOT JUST THE PROBEM FOR DEMOCRATS IN ONE SENSE IT'S A BIG PROBIM FOR THEM IN ANOTHER WHICH THE JO MANSION COULD EASILY JOIN A NO LABELS TICKET SO THE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK OVER LAST COUPLE O YEARS ABOUT A NO LABEL'S THIRD PARTY TICKETE TAKING VOTES AWAY FROM JOBIDEN AND THAT COULD EASILY HAPPEN MIT ROMNEY HAS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SENATE JO MANSION HAS RETIRED FROM THE SENATE AND SO THERE'S A WIDE SPREAD PUSH TO RUN A MANSION ROMNEY OR ROMNY MANSION TICKETE AS A SORT OF THIRD PARTY ALTERNATIVE THAT IS VERY RISKY FOR JOBIDE A MEAN SUPER RISKY FOR JOBIDE BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING HE HAS A CERTAIN LOCKED AN LEVEL OF SUPPORT IT'S NOT ALL THAT HIGE HIS LOCKED AND LEVEL OF SUPPORT IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THEMID THIRTIES MEANWHILE HE GOT DONALTRUMP HIS LOCKED AND LEVEL OF SUPPORT IS PROBABLY IN THE LOW FORTIES TO MID FORTIES THERE'S POBABLY FIFTEEN TWENTY PER CENT THE VOTE THAT'S UP FOR GRABS IN BETWEEN THERE NOW IF THERE'S NO SERIOUS THIRD PARTY CHALLENGE NO SERIOUS THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE THEN PROBABLY THOSE PEOPLE SPLIT IN FAVOR OF JOBIDON THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS AN ELECTION R DONAL TRUMPIS AN VALL HOWEVER IF THERE IS A PLAUSIBLE THIRD PARTY ALTERNATIVE THAT CHANGE IS REAL FAST RIGHT NOW ROBERT OFF KENNEDY IS THE JUNIOR IS IS SORT OF THE DEFAULT WHAT IF THERE IS A THIRD PARTY GUY AND IN A LOT OF PALLING HEIS UP IN LIKE THE TWENTIES IN ONE PLACE UP IN THE THIRTIES WHICH JUST SHOWS THE WILD DISFATISFACTION THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS WITH THE CURRENT POLITICAL CHOICE IS BEING OFFERED THEM BEING IN A NON FUNCTIONAL EIGHTY YEAR OLD AND DONAL TRUMP LIKE THE O TESE OF TESE ARE NOT CHOICEIS THAT THE BROAD SWATH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE INTOE THE PARTY BASES IN THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY LOVES TRUMP THE PARTY BASE IN THE DEMOCRAT PARTY DOESN' AL OBIDE BYT THE FILIC TOR STUCK WITH HIM AN'S THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE OR SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE AND DISSATISFIED WITH BOTH CANDIDATES AND TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONE QUA MODERATE TICKETES  A A PARTY CROSSING TICKET THOTBU LIKE MANSION ROMNY UNURANSEE I TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT THE POPULATION THAT TO GA VERY SERIOUS LOOK AT THAT IN  COME DIS PROPORTIONATELY WOUD IMATION FROM JOBIDE INSIDE BECAUS AGAIN DONAL TRUMP HAS A HIGHER LEVEL HEAS O HEAS A HIGHER FLOOR HEIS A LOWER CEILING AND E HAS A HIGHER FLOOR DONAL TRUMP A JU JOBIDEN HAS A LOWER FLOOR AND A HIGHER CEILING JUST ELECTORALLY SPEAKING THAT'S WHAT ALTHOUGH BECAUSE IT IS POOR PERFORMANCS HIS CEILING MAY ALSO BE REALLY LOW AT THIS POINT ACCORDING TO THE NER TIMES WHE MANSION PLANS TO DO REMAINS MYSTERY HIS CLOSESTATES AN ADVISERS INSIST THEY DON'T KNOW A CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT WHO AS SERVED IS ONE OF HIS PARTIES KEY VOTES IN THE SENATE HE IS LONG KEPT HIS OWN COUNCIL ON HIS BIGGEST DECISIONS AND MADE UP HIS MIND AT THE LAST MINUTE MANSION IS FLORITED THIS YEAR WITH

MILLINS OF DOLLARS TO RUN A CREDIBLE INDEPENDENT OR THIRD PARTY CAMPAIGN BUT HE MIGHT JUST BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVELS OF DIS SATISFACTION FOR MONTHS THIS YEAR MANSION IS COSE IUED UP TO NO LABELS ACCORDING TO THE NARRO TIMES WHICH SO FAR HAS SECURED BALLAD ACIS IN TWELVE STATES IN AN ATTEMPT TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO BIDON AND TRUMP THE GROUP'S PRESENT MANCY JACOBSON HAS TOLD POTENTIAL DONERS THE GROUP INTENDS TO SELECT A REPUBLICAN TO LEAD IT STICKET A DECISION THTWOUL EXCLUDE MANSION IF NO LABELS MAINTAINS THAT POSITION ONE CANDIDATEWH'S OPENLY TEASING A NO LABELS RUN LARRY HOGAN HE'S

BECUS AGAIN THEY LOOK AT JOBIDON AND THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY SEE SO THE THE REALITIES THAT ARE SETTING IN FOR JOBIDON ARE VERY REAL AND VERY TERRIFYING HE'SGEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT PRETTY QUICKLY WHAT HIS STRATEGY IS HIS STRATEGY BY THE WAY IS GOING TOBE JUST ATTACKING DONAL TRUMP WHY THAT WORKS ARE NOT IS GOING TO BE VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON THE NEW CYCLE AND IF YOU'RE DEMOCRAT RUNNGAGAINS OMALTRUMP

POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF

IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOC COM LASH HUBERMENT THIS MONTH WE'RE TALKING ALL ABOUT THE NAUROW SCIENCE OF EMOTIONS AND TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT CENTIAL TO OUR DAILY LIFE AND THAT'S MOTIVATION WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PLEASURE AND REWARD WHAT UNDERLIES OUR SENSE OF PLEASURE OR REWARD WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ADDICTIONS YOU CAN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT PLEASURE AND REWARD WITHOUT HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT ADDICTIONS AND THE ADDCTIVE PROPERTIES OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES AS WELL AS HAW TO BREAK FREE OF ADICTION AS WELL WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NEURO CHEMISTRY OF DRIVE AND MIND SET SO ALL THESE THEMES ARE WOVEN TOGETHER IN THE CONTECT OF EMOTIONS EACH ONE OF THEM OF COURSE COULD ALSO BE ITS OWN ENTIRE MONTH OF THE PODCAST AND IN FACT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ENTIRE MONTH DEVOTED TO ADDICTION AND I HAVE A VERY SPESSIAL GUESS THAT'S GOING TO BE JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND CLINICAL PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW ORE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING AND TREATING ADICTION BUT FOR NOW LET'S JUS TALK ABOUT THE NAUROW SCIENCE OF MOTIVATION AND REWARD OF PLEASURE AND PAIN BECAUSE THOSE ARE CENTRAL TO WHAT WE THINK OF IT AS E MOTIONS WHETHER NOT WE FEEL GOOD WHETHER NOT WE FEEL WE'RE ON TRACK IN LIFE WHETHER NOT WE FEEL WE'RE FALLING BEHIND SO MOTIVATION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DAILY LIFE IT'SWHAT ALLOWS US TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING IT'S WHAT ALLOWS US TO PURSUE LONG TERM GOALS OR SHORT TERM GOALS MOTIVATION AND THE CHEMISTRY OF MOTIVATION IS TIGHTLY WOUND IN WITH THE NEURO CHEMISTRY OF MOVEMENT IN FACT THE SAME SINGLE MOLECULE DOPAMINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR SENSE OF MOTIVATION AND FOR MOVEMENT EVEN THOUGH NERVES CONTROLLING MUSCLES SO AGAIN THESE ARE NERVES IN THE SPINAL QUARTER BRAIN THAT MOVE OUR LIMBS THE EFFECTOR CHEMICAL THERE THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES THE MUSCLES TO TWITCH TO CONTRACT IS A SEETACOLLING IN THE BRAIN ASETO CALLINGS RESPONSIBLE FOR FOCUS HOWEVER WHETHER OR NOT WE MOVE WHETHER NOT WE WANT TO MOVE WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE THE DESIRE TO OVERCOME BARRIERS OF YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE SOCIAL BARRIERS OR FINANCIAL BARRIERS OR TIME CONSTRAINTS THAT DEPENDS ON THIS MOLECULE WE CALL DOPOMINE IT'S A FASCINATING MOLECULE AND IT LIES AT THE CENTR OF SO MANY GREAT THINGS IN LIFE AND IT LIES AT THE CENTR OF SO MANY TERRIBLE ASPECTS OF LIFE NAMELY ADDICTION AND CERTAIN FORMS OF MENTAL DISEASE SO IF EVER THERE WAS A DOUBLE EAGED BLADE IN THE WORLD OF NARRO SCIENCE ITS DOPAMINE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT DOPOMINE IS AND AS ALWAYS WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ACTIONABLE TOOLS TO DAY WERE DEFINLING IN A TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS RELATE TO SUPPLEMENTATION ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT IT'S NOT ALL JUST ABOUT INCREASING DOPOMINENCS IN PARTICULAR IN SOME CASES THAT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO SOMETIMES IT'S APPROPRIATE SOMETIMES IT'S NOT MORE SO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS RELATE TO WHAT'S CALLED DOPOMINE SCHEDULING HOW THE WAY THAT YOU'RE LEADING YOUR LIFE IN THE WAY THAT YOURE CONCEPTIALIZING YOUR GOALS CAN ACTUALLY PREDICT WHETHER R NOT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE THOSE GOALS AND THEREFORE WHETHER NOT YOU WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS AS WELL AS WHEATHER NOT YOU WILL QUIT THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOPAMINE RELEASED IN YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR DESIRE TO EXERT EFFORT AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL THE SCHEDULE OF DOPAMINE RELEASE BUT IT REQUIRES THE APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE UNDERSTANDING THE WAY THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM WORKS WILL ALLOW YOU TO LEVERAGE IT TO YOUR BENEFIT AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE DOPAMINE WORKS THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT IT'S GOING TO PULL YOU OUT INTO THE CURRENT OF LIFE MEANING THE REST OF THE WORLD IS GOING TO CONTROL YOUR DOPAMINE SCHEDUALS SOME EXCITED TO TELL YOU ABOUT TO DAY'S INFORMATION YOU CAN A LEARNS SOME BASIC SCINCE YOU CAN LEARN A LOT OF TOOLS AND THESE TOOLS I BELIEVE ARE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR FIVE YEARS OLD EIGHT YEARS OLD EIGHTY YEARS OLD OR ANYTHING IN BETWEEN SO LET'S TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE LET'S GET A FEW BASIC FACTS ON THE TABLE DOPAMINE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES ND IT WAS DISCOVERED AS THE PRECURSIR MEANING THE THING FROM WHICH EPINEFRON OR DRENOLIN IS MADE NOW THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS MOLECULE WE CALL DOPAMINE NOWADAYS WE THINK OF AS THE MOLECULADE REWARD AND PLEASURE BUT ACTUALLY IT IS THE SUBSTRAT FROM WHICH A DRENOLINE IS MADE AND IN THE BRAIN IT'S THE SUBSTRAIT FROM WHICH EPINEFRAN IS MADE EPINEPRAN IS THE SAME THING AS A DRENALIN EXCEPT IN THE BRAIN WE CALL EPINEFERAN EPINEFRAN IS YOU MAY RECALL FROM PREVIOUS PODCASS OR IF YOU HAVEN'T NO PROBLEM EPINEFRAN ALLOWS US TO GET INTO ACTION IT' STIMULATES CHANGES IN THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THE HEART IN THE ORGANS AND TISSUES OF THE BODY THAT BIAS US FOR MOVEMENT AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT EPINEFRON YOU CAN CHECK OUT OUR EPISODE ON MASTERING STRESS O TALK A LOT ABOUT IT THERE DOPAMINE WAS INITIALLY THOUGHT TO BE JUST THE BUILDING BLOCK FOR EPINEFRON AND IT IS INDEED THE CHEMICAL BUILDING BLOCK FROM WHICH EPINEFRAN IS MADE HOWEVER DOPAMINE DOES A LOT OF THINGS ON ITS OWN IT'S NOT ALWAYS CONVERTED TO EPINEFERAN DOPAMINE IS RELEASED FROM SEVERAL SITES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE FOR TO DAY'S DISCUSSION ABOUT MOTIVATION AND REWARD IS SOMETHING THAT SOMETIMES JUST CALL THE REWARD PATHWAY FOR THE IFA SENATOS THAT SOMETIMES CALLD THE MESO LIMBIC REWARD PATHWAY BUT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT TO YOUR DESIRE TO ENGAGE IN ACTION AND IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE GETTING ADDICTED TO SUBSTANCES OR BEHAVIORS SO HOW DOES THIS WORK WELL YOU'VE GOT A STRUCTURE IN THE DEEP PART OF YOUR BRAIN CALLED THE V T A IT STANDS FOR VENTURAL TAGMENTAL AREA AS ALWAYS YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER THESE NAMES BUT IF YOU WANT TO I OFFER THEM TO YOU FOR FO FORTHER GUGALING RESEARCH READING ET CETERA THE V T ER VENTURAL TEGMENTAL AREA CONTAINS IN ERONS THAT SEND WHAT WE CALL AXONTAL WIRES THAT SPIT OUT DOPAMINE AT A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE CALL THE NUCLEOUS ACCUMBENTS AND THOSE TWO STRUCTURES VITIA AND NUCLEUS HE CUMBENTS FORM REALLY THE CORE MACHINERY OF THE REWARD PATHWAY IN THE PATHWAY THAT CONTROLS YOUR MOTIVATION FOR ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF THEM LIKE AN EXCELERATOR THEY BIACE YOU FOR ACTION HOWEVER WITHIN THE REWARD PATHWAY THERE'S ALSO A BREAKE THE BREAKE OR RESTRICTION ON THAT DOPOMINE WHICH CONTROLS WHEN IT'S RELEASED AND HOW MUCH ITS RELEASED IS THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS THE NURL REAL ESTATE RIGHT BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD IT'S DISCUSSED FOR SO MANY ASPECTS OF NARRO SINES YOU HEREABOUT IT FOR DECISION MAKING EXECUTIVE FUNCTION FOR PLANNING ET CETERA AND INDEED ITS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THOSE IT'S THIS REALLY UNIQUE REAL ESTATE THAT WE WERE ALL ENDOWED WITH AS HUMANS OTHER ANIMALS DON'T HAVE MUCH OF IT WE HAVE A LOT OF IT AND THAT PREFRONTAL QUARTEX ACTS AS A BREAK ON THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM WITHOUT THAT BREAK YOU WOULD BE PURELY A PLEASURE SEEKING ANIMAL YOU WOULD BE PURELY PLEASURE SEEKING YOU WOULD HAVE NO BASIS FOR REGULATING YOUR BEHAVIOR IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET THINGS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE IMPORTANT FEATURE OF MOTIVATION WHICH IS THAT MOTIVATION IS A TWO PART PROCESS WHICH IS ABOUT BALANCING PLEASURE AND PAIN  MOST PEOPLE THING ABOUT MOTIVATION AND REWARD AN DOPOMINE IS JUST TRYING TO ACHIEVE PLEASURE AND INDEED DOPAOMINE IS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN FROM THE VITIE AT THE NUCLEOS ACCUMBENTS WHEN WE EXPERIENCE THINGS THAT WE LIKE SO HERE'S THE WAY TO CONCEPTIALIZE THIS AND IF YOU CAN INTERNALIZE THIS IN YOUR MIND IT WILL REALLY HELP YOU AS YOU MOVE THROUGH YOUR DA TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU MIGHT BE MOTIVATED OR NOT MOTIVATED FOR CERTAIN THINGS SO WHEN YOU'RE JUST SITTING AROUND NOT DOING MUCH IV ANYTHING MAY YOU WAKE UP IN BED IN THE MORNING YOU RVE THING ABOUT GET N WE GET N UP OR NOT THIS REWARD PATHWAY IS RELEASING DOPOMINE AT A RATE OF ABOUT THREE OR FOUR TIMES PER SECOND IT'S CON A FIRING IN A LOW LEVEL WHEN I SAY FIRING MEAN ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THE NURONS SO WHEN YOU ARE JUST AROUND YOU FEEL OKA NOT DEPRESS NOT HIGHLY MOTIV ATED NOT EXCITED MAY BE THREE OR FOUR TIMES A SECONG IF SUDDENLY YOU GET EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING YOU ANTICIPATE SOMETHING NOT RECEIVE AN AWARD BUT YOU GET EXCITED IN AN ANTICIPATORY WAY THEN THE RATE OF FIRING THE RATE OF ACTIVITY IN THIS REWARD PATHWAY SUDDENLY INCREASES TO LIKE THIRTY OR FORTY TIMES AND IT HAS THE EFFECT OF CREATING A SENSE OF ACTION OR DESIRE TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE THING THAT YOUR CRAVING IT FACT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT DOPOMINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WANTING AND FOR CRAVING AND THAT'S DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THAT YOU HEAR IT TALKED ABOUT NORMALLY WHICH IS AT ITS INVOLVED IN PLEASURE SO YES DOPAMINE IS RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO SECS ITS RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO FOOD IT'S RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO A LOT OF THINGS BUT IT'S MOSTLY RELEASED IN ANTICIPATION AND CRAVING FOR A PARTICULAR THING IT HAS THE EFFECT OF NARROWING OUR FOCUS FOR THE THING THAT WE CRAVE AND THAT THING COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A CUP OF COFFEE IT COULD BE AS ON IMPORTANT AS A BIG BOARD MEETING THAT COULD BE A BIG FINAL EXAMIT COULD BE OF THE PERSON THAT WERE EXCITED TO MEAT OR SEE DOPAMINE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT YOURE CRAVING IT JUST RELEASES AT A PARTICULAR RATE IN FACT IF WE JUST TAKE A STEP BACK AND WE LOOK AT THE SCIENTIFIC DATA ON HOW MUCH THE DOPAMINE FIRING INCREASES IN RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT THINGS YOU GET A PRETTY INTERESTING WINDOW INTO HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS AND WHY YOU MIGHT BE MOTIVATED OR NOT MOTIVATED LET'S SAY YOURE HUNGRY OR YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IR TO A CUP OF COFFEE OR YOU'RE GOING TO SEE YOUR PARTNER WELL YOUR DOPAMINE NURONS ARE FIRING AT A LOW RATE UNTIL YOU START FINKING ABOUT THE THING THAT YOU WANT OR THE THING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO LET SAY YOUR CRAVING CHOCOLATE OR A GOOD MEAL STAKE IF YOU LIKE STAKE OR A NICE PLAY OPOSTA IF YOU LIKE POSTA WHEN YOU EAT THAT FOOD THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE THAT'S RELEASED IN THIS REWARD PATHWAY GOES UP ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT ABOVE BASELINE THE NURONS THERE GO FROM FIRING YO THREE OR FOUR TIMES PER CECOND TO YOU KNOW SIX OR TEN TIMES PER SECOND IT REALLY DEPENDS AND THESE AREN'N EXACT NUMBERS BUT IF WE WERE TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE THAT'S RELEASED IT GOES UP ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT SECTS WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR SPECIES CONTINUATION AND REPRODUCTION ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FOR FOR CONCEIVING CHILDREN SECTS DOES RELEASE DOPAMIN AND IT INCREASES DOPAMINE LEVELS ABOUT A HUNDRED PER CENT SO BASICALLY DOUBLES THEM NICOTINE OF THE SORT THAT'S AND CIGARETTES OR SOME PEOPLE ARE TAKING NICOTINE IN SUPPLEMENTAL FORM INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT ABOVE BASE LINE IT ALSO DOES SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WERE GOIN A TALK ABOUT BUT NICOTINE DOES THAT AND IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING THAT NICOTINE WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE IN YOUR BRAIN VERY QUICKLY WITHIN SECONDS THAT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES OVER BASELINE AS OPPOSED TO SECS WHICH IS A HUNDRED PER CENT ABOVE OR FOOD WHICH IS FIFTY PER CENT COCANE AND EMPHETAMINE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE THAT'S RELEASED A THOUSANDFOLD WITHIN ABOUT TEN SECONDS OF CONSUMING THE DRUG HOWEVER JUST THINKING ABOUT FOOD ABOUT SECS ABOUT NICOTINE IF YOU LIKE NICOTINE OR COCANOR INPEDEMIN CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE THAT'S RELEASED TO THE SAME DEGREE AS ACTUALLY CONSUMING THE DRUG NOW IT DEPENDS IN SOME CASES FOR INSTANCE THE COCANE USE OR THE ATTIC THAT WANTS COCINE CAN'T JUST THINK ABOUT COCANE AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THAT'S RELEASED ABOUT A THOUSANDFOLD IS HASHU MUCH LOWER BUT IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO PUT THEM ON THE MOTIVATION TRACK FOR TO CRAVE THAT PARTICULAR THING NOW THERE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD HAVE BRAIN CIRCUITURY LIKE THIS I ME BRAIN CIRCUITRY LIKE THIS DIDN'T EVOLVE TO GET YOU ADDICTED BRAIN CIRCUITRY LIKE THIS INVOLVED IN ORDER TO MOTIVATE BEHAVIORS TOWARD PARTICULAR GOALS WATER WHEN YOU'RE THIRSTY SECS IN ORDER TO REPRODUCE AND WE'REGIN TO TALK ABUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ESTROGEN AND ESTOSTRO IN THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM BECAUSE THOSE HORMONES ACTUALLY BIAS DOPAMINE TO BE RELEASED THESE THINGS AND THESE BRAINARY IS INURON'S WORD PART OF THET EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY THAT LED TO THE CONTINUATION OF OUR SPECIES THINGS LIKE COCAN AN AMPHEDAMING ARE DISASTROUS FOR MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY RELEASE SO MUCH DOPAOMIN AND THEY CREATE THESE CLOSED LOOPS WHERE PEOPLE THAN ONLY CRAVE THE PARTICULAR THING COKAN AMPHEDAMING THAT LEADS TO THOSE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DOPOMINE RELEASE MOST THINGS DON'T RELEASE THAT THAT LEVEL OF DOPAMIN AND NOWADAYS THARE'S A TON OF INTEREST IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND INVIDIO GAMES AND IT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MEASUREMENTS OF THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE RELEASED VIDIO GAMES ESPECIALLY VIDO GAMES THAT HAVE A VERY HIGH UPDATE SPEED WHERE THERE'S NOVEL TERRITORY ALL THE TIME NOT NOVELTY IS A BIG STIMULUS OF DOPOMINE THOSE CAN RELEASE DOPOMINE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NICOTINE AND COCANE SO VERY HIGH LEVELS OF DOPAMINE RELEASE SOCIOMEDIAS AN INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMING THAT'S RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO LOGGING ON TO SOCIALMEDIA INITIALLY COULD BE QUITE HIGH BUT IT SEEMS LIKE LIKELY THAT THERE'S A TAPER IN THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE BUT AND YET PEOPLE STILL GET ADDICTED SO WHY WHY IS IT THAT WE CAN GET ADDICTED TO THINGS THAT FAIL TO GET TO ELICIT THE SAME MASSIVE AMOUNT OF PLEASURE THAT THEY INITIALLY DID BEING ADDICTED TO SOMETHING ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT FEEL SO GOOD THAT YOU WANT TO DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THIS PLEASURE PAINE BALANCE THAT UNDERLIES MOTIVATION SO LET'S LOOK ALOBIC CLOSER AT THE PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE BECAUSE THEREIN LIES THE TOOLS FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL MOTIVATION TOWARD HEALTHY THINGS AND AVOID MOTIVATED BEHAVIORS TOWARDS THINGS THAT ARE DESTRUCTIVE FOR YOU THERE ARE LOT OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE TRY NOVEL BEHAVIORS WHETHER NOT THOSE OR DRUGS OR WHETHER NOT THOSE ARE ADVENTURE THRILL SEEKING THINGS WHERE THEY SEEK OUT NEW PARTNERS OR YOU KNOW THEY TAKE A NEW CLASS AS YOU'LL NOTICE I'M NOT PLACING ANY JUDGMENT OR VALUE ON THESE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS ALTHOUGH I THING IT'S FAIR TO POINT OUT THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE ADDICTIVE DRUGS LIKE COCAN AN AMPHEDAMINE ARE VERY DESTRUCTIVE ACTUALLY WE KNOW THAT ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT OVE PEOPLE HAVE A GENETIC BIAS TOWARDS ADDICTION THAT YOU KNOW YOU SOMETIMES HERE THAT THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU USE A DRUG YOU CAN BECOME ADDICTED TO IT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT BEEN SHOWN TO BE TRUE FOR MOST THINGS IN MOST PEOPLE BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY IS TRUE AND WE'LL TALK ALOBIC LATOR ABOUT WHY CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE HEAVILY BIAS TOWARD BECOMING ATTICS ON THE FIRST USE OF A PARTICULAR DRUG ITSUCUALLY VERY INTERESTING T HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER NOT THEY WERE FORMELLY ADDICTED TO SOMETHING ELSE BUT IN ANY CASE THE WAY THA ADDICTION WORKS AND THE WAY THAT MOTIVATION WORKS GENERALLY IN THE NON ADDICTIVE SETTING IS THAT WHEN YOU ANTICIPATE SOMETHING ELOPIT OF DOPOMIN IS RELEASED AND THEN WHEN YOU REACH THAT THING YOURE ENGAGE IN THAT THING THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMING GOES UP EVEN FURTHER BUT AS YOU REPEATEDLY PURSUE A BEHAVIOR AND YOU REPEATEDLY ENGAGE WITH A PARTICULAR THING LET TAY YOU LOVE RUNNING OR YOU LOVE CHOCOLATE AS YOU EAT A PIECE OF CHOCOLATE BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT TASTES GOOD AND THEN THERE'S A SHIFT A WAY FROM ACTIVATION OF DOPAMINE AND THERE ARE OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE RELEASED THAT TRIGGER A LOW LEVEL SENSE OF PAIN NOW YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL AS PHYSICAL PAIN BUT THE CRAVING THAT YOU FEEL IS BOTH ONE PART DOPAMIN AND ONE PART THE MIRROR IMAGE OF DOPAMNE WHICH IS THE PAIN OR THE CRAVING FOR YET ANOTHER PIECE OF CHOCOLATEAND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND SUBTLE FEATURE OF THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM THAT'S NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED PEOPLE ALWIYSIDE ABOUT JUST AS PLEASURE YOU LOVE SOCHAMEDIA SO IT GIVES YOUDOPAMENANCE WOYOU ENGAGE IN THAT YOU LIKE CHOCOLATE IT RELEASES DOAMINES YOU DO THAT BUT FOR EVERY BIT OF DOPAMIN THAT'S RELEASED THERE'S ANOTHER CIRCUIT IN THE BRAIN THAT CREATES YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS KIND OF LIKE A DOWNWARD DEFLECTION IN PLEASURE SO YOU ENGAGE IN SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT AND THERE'S AN INCREASE IN PLEASURE AND THEN THERE'S A WITHOUT YOU DOING ANYTHING THERE'S A MIRROR IMAGE OF THAT WHICH IS A DOWNWARD DEFLECTION IN PLEASURE WHICH WERECALLING PAIN SO FOR EVERY BIT OF PLEASURE THERE IS A MIRROR IMAGE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN AND THEY OVERLAP IN TIME VERY CLOSELY SO IT SOMETIMES HARD TO SENSE THIS BUT TRY IT THE NEXT TIME YOU EAT SOMETHING REALLY DELICIOUS YOU'LL TAKE A BYTE IT TASTES DELICIOUS AND PART OF THE EXPERIENCE IS TO WANT MORE OF THAT THING THIS IS TRUE FOR ANY PLEASUREFUL EXPERIENCE NOW THE DIABOLICAL PART ABOUT DOPAMIN IS THAT BECAUSE IT DINT EVOLVE IN ORDER TO GET YOU TO INDULGE IN MORE AND MORE AND MORE OF SOME THING WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT INITIALLY YOU EXPERIENCE AN INAN INCREASE IN PLEASURE AND YOU ALSO EXPERIENCE THIS INCREASE IN PAIN SHORTLY AFTER OR WOVEN IN WITH THE PLEASURE THAT MAKES YOU WANT MORE OF THAT THING BUT WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT TIME THAT YOU ENCOUNTER THAT THING THAT YOU PURSUE THE CHOCOLATE THAT YOU A YOU PURSUE THE LOVER EACH TIME THE EXPERIENCE OF DOPAMINE RELEASE AND PLEASURE IS DIMINISHED A LITTLE BIT AND THE DIABOLICAL THING IS THAT THE PAIN RESPONSE IS INCREASED A LITTLE BIT AND THIS IS BEST OBSERVED IN THE CONTECTS OF DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIORE THE FIRST TIME SOME ONE DECIDES TO TAKE COCANE OR IMPHEDOMINE THEY MAY DO IT OT ABORDUM THEY MAY DO IT OUT OF PURE PRESSURE THEY MAY DO IT TO RELIEVE SOME INTERNAL SENSE MAY BE THEIRE BORDER THERE JUST EXCITED MAY BE THEIRE HIGH AND NOVEL NOVELTY SEEKING THEIR LOT OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE MIGHT TRY A DRUG FAR TOO MANY FOR US TO YOU KNOW TO GET INTO OR PARSE HERE MAY BE THEY DONTLY WANT TO DO IT BUT SOE ONE ENCOURAGES THEM THEY WILL EXPERIENCE A HUGE DOPAMIN RELEASE AND THEY WILL FEEL LIKELY VERY GOOD HOWEVER THE NEXT TIME THEY TAKE IT IT WON'T FEEL QUITE AS GOOD AND IT WON'T FEEL EVEN AS GOOD THE THIRD TIME OR THE NEXT TIME BUT THE AMOUNT OF PAIN THE AMOUNT OF CRAVING THAT THEY EXPERIENCE FOR THE DRUG WILL INCREASE OVER TIME SO MUCH OF OUR PURSUIT OF PLEASURE IS SIMPLY TO REDUCE THE PAIN OF CRAVING SO THE NEXT TIME YOU EXPERIENCE SOMETHING YOU REALLY LIKE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT OF THAT EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOTICE THIS THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU REALLY ENJOY PART OF THAT ENJOYMENT IS ABOUT THE ANTICIPATION AND WANTING OF MORE OF THAT THING AND THAT'S THE PAIN SYSTEM IN ACTION AND SO WE CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DOPAMINE WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT PLEASURE AND DOPAMIN WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT MOTIVATION TO PURSUE MORE IN ORDER TO RELIEF OR EXCLUDE FUTURE PAIN LET ME REPEAT THAT DOPAMENE ISN'T AS MUCH ABOUT PLEASURE AS MUCH AS IT IS ABOUT MOTIVATION AND DESIRE TO PURSUE MORE IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PAIN AND WE ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT PAIN AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN AND A CRAVING ALTHOUGH PEOPLE THAT MISS A LOVER VERY BADLY OR THAT REALLY CRAVE OF FOOD VERY BADLY OR THAT ARE ADDICTED TO A DRUGAN CAN'T ACT AS IT WILL EXPERIENCE THAT AS A PHYSICAL CRAVING ANIMENTAL CRAVING THE BODY AND BRAIN ARE LINKED IN THIS WAY IT'S T ALMOST THEY'LL DESCRIBE IT AS PAINFUL THEY YEARN FOR IT AND I THINK THE WORD YEARNING IS ONE THAT'S VERY VALUABLE THISS CONTEXT BECAUSE YEARNING SEEMS TO INCLUDE A WHOLE BODY EXPERIENCE MORE THAN JUST WANTING WHICH COULD JUST BE UP IN THE MIND SO YOURE DESIRE FOR SOMETHING ITS PROPORTIONAL TO HOW PLEASUREFUL IT IS TO INDULGE IN THAT THING BUT ALSO HOW MUCH PAIN YOU EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE IT AND YOU CAN NOW START TO LET YOUR MIND WANDERING TO ALL SORTS OF EXAMPLES OF EDICTIONS OR THINGS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO LIKE IM I'LL USE WO THE EXAMPLE THAT I SOMETIMES USE ON HEARE WHICH IN MY LOVE OF CRESSANCE AL THOUGH SEVERAL OF YOU POINTED OUT THESE ARE CALLED CUOSSON BUT THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE IOM TRYNG TO SPEAK FRENCH AND I ALWAYS TRIED TO DO THAT WHEN I WAS A KID AND I WENT TO A BYLINGAL SCHOL IN IT FAIL THEN ANS CAN A FAIL NOW S I'MN CALL THEM CRESSANTE A THEI'RE DELICIOUS I LOVE THEM A REALLY GOOD ONE MAKES ME WANE TO EAT SIX IT'S TRUE I HAVE PRETTY GOOD IMPULSE CONTROL I THINK BUT IT MAKES ME WANE TO EAT SIX I TASTE IT AND TASTE SO DELICIOUS AND UNLESS I REALLY FORCE MYSELF TO EXPERIENCE THE TASTE OF IT IN MY MOUTH AND HOW FLAKY I'M GETTING HUNGRY FOR RIY NOW AND DELICIOUS THE CRESSANT IS MOSTLY THE TASTE OF THAT CRESSANT MAKES ME WANT TO EAT MORE CRESSANT NOW EVENTUALLY BLOOD SUGAR GOES UP SOTIETY IS REACHED AT CETERA WHAT HAPPENS THEN WHAT IS SATISFACTION AN SOTITY ABOUT WILL THAT'S A SEPARATE NEUROMODULATOR THAT'S ABOUT THE NEUROMODULATOR CERATONIN IT'S ABOUT OXY TOSEN IT'S ABOUT A HORMONE SYSTEM THAT INVALLSOME THY CALL PROLACTAN SO OR GAN TO TALK ABOUT ALL ALL OF THOSE IN THE BOOK THE MOLECULE OF MORE WONDERFUL BOOK A THOSE WERE DESCRIBED AS THE HERE AND NOW MOLECULES THE ONES THAT ALLOW YOU TO EXPERIENCE YOUR SENSATIONS AND PLEASURE IN THE PRESENT AND FOR WHICH THE BRAIN STOPS PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT CRAVING AND AND THESE SO CALLED HERE AND NOW MOLECULES AND HOW THOSE ENGAGE IN A KIND OF PUSHPOL BALANCE THAT WILLALLOW YOU TO NOTJOUS FEEL MORE MOTIVATED BUT ALSO TO ENJOY THE THINGS IN LIFE THAT YOU ARE PURSU ING TO MUCH GREATER DEGREE WE HAVE NURONS IN TAN AREA OF OUR BRAIN CALLED THE RAPE ARE A P H E THE RAPHE RELEASES CRATONAN AT DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE BRAIN SERATONAN IS THE MOLECULE OF BLISS AND CONTENTMENT FOR WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE HAVE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT EXTEROCEPTION EXTEROCEPTION IS A FOCUS ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD EVERYTHING BEYOND THE CONFINES OF YOUR SKIN  ALSO TALKED ABOUT INTEROCEPTION A FOCUS ON THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING INTERNALLY WITHIN THE CONFINES OF YOUR SKIN DOPAMINE AND CERATONAN CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS RELATED TO EXTEROCEPTION DOPOMIN MAKES US FOCUSED ON THINGS OUTSIDE US THAT ARE BEYOND WHAT WE CALL OUR PERSONAL SPACE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO MOVE AND TAKE ACTION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THINGS AND CERATONAN IN GENERAL HAS TO DO WITH THE THINGS THAT ARE IN OUR IMMEDIATE HERE AND NOW HENCE THE DESCRIPTION OF THES AS THE HERE AN NOW MOLECULES SO IT'S INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THAT THE BODY AND THE BRAIN CAN AT DO DIRECT ITS ATTENTION TOWARDS THINGS OUTSIDE US OR INSIDE US OR SPLIT OUR ATTENTION BETWEEN THOSE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN A PREVIOUS POTCAS BUT IF YOU DIDN'T SEE IT NO PROBLEM JUST UNDERSTAND THAT DOPOMINE BIACES US TOWARD THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE WHEREAS CERATONAN AND SOME OF THE RELATED MOLECULES LIKE THE END O CANABINOIDS IF YOU PICKED UP ON THE WORD CANABINOID YES IT'S LIKE CANABUS BECAUSE CANABUS ATACHES TO ENDI CANABINOID RECEPTORS AND THE ENDICANABINOIDS AR RECEPTORS AND CHEMICALS THAT THE CANABINOIDS THAT YOU NATURALLY MAKE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE FORGETTING IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT POTSMOKERS DON'T HAVE THE MOST TERRIFIC MEMORY YOU MAY KNOW AF FEW THAT HAVE GREAT MEMORIES BUT CHANCES ARE THEY WOULD HAVE EVEN BETTER MEMORIES IF A THEY WEREN'T POT SMOKERS BUT YOU MAKE THESE MOLECULES THAT BIND THESE RECEPTORS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL KIND OF BLISSED OUT AND CONTENT IN THE PRESENT THOSE ARE RECEPTORS THAT EXIST IN US NOT FOR SAKE OF CONSUMING T  C OR MARUANA BUT FORSAKE OF BINDING OF OUR NATURAL IN DOGENIS CANABINOIDS SO YOU GOT THESE TWO SYSTEMS THAT COME LIKE A PUSHPULL AND IF YOU WERE TO SAY DO THE ANOIN THE BOOK OF WHEREVER YOU GO THERE YOU ARE JOHN COBATS INTALKS ABOUT THIS A MEDITATION PRACTISE THATS DIFFERENT THAN MOST MEDITATION PRACTICES WHERE YOU EAT ONE AMIN AND YOU FOCUS ALL OF YOUR ATTENTION ON THE AMIN THE TASTE OF THE OMIN THE TEXTURE OF THE AMIN THAT'S REALLY A MINDFULNESS PRACTISE THATS GEAR TOWARDS TRYING TO TAKE A BEHAVIOR WHICH IS NORMALLY ABOUT PURSUIT NORMALLY FEEDING IS WERE GOING ENGAGE IN FEEDING BECAUSE OF DOPAMINE WE PURSUE MORE OF A FOOD BECAUSE OF THAT PLEASURE PAIN RELATIONSHIP I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE FOCUS ON THE ONE AMON WHERE THE OR BECOMING VERY PRESENT IN ANY BEHAVIOR THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE A KIND OF EXTEROCEPTIVE PURSUIT BEHAVIOR AND BRING IT INTO THE HERE AND NOW THAT'S A MENTAL TRICK OR A MENTAL TASK THAT THE MINDFULNESS COMMUNITY HAS REALLY EMBRACED IN ORDER TO TRYING CREATE INCREASED PLEASURE FOR WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE IT'S REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH A SHIFT FROM DOPAMEINE BEING RELEASED TO SERATONAN AND THE CONABONOID SYSTEM BEING INVOLVED IN THAT BEHAVIOR SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MINDFULNESS WHICH IS SOME THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST AND I A S AVE MADES OM OFF THE CUFF JOKES ABOUT THE OPPOSIT OF MINDFULNESS BEING MINDLESSNESS MINDFULNESS IS A VAST SPACE THAT IS OF MINDFUL PRACTISE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE OF ENGAGED IN AND INDEED IT CAN GIVE YOU DEEPER APPRECIATION FOR THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE DOPAMINE HAS THE QUALITY OF MAKING PEOPLE KIND OF RAPIDLY IN PURSUIT OF THINGS LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGH ON COCANEOR ENPEDEMING AND THEY ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY EXTROCEPTIVE DRUGS LIKE MERAUANA THE OPIOIDS ANYTHING THAT A REALLY HITS THE SERATONAN SYSTEM HARD TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE RATHER LETHARGIC AND CONTENT TO STAY EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE THEY DON'T WANT A PURSO MUCH AT ALL A OCASIONALLY WHEN PEOPLE IT THE SMOKE MARWANER CONSUMETIAGE SEE THEIR APPETITE GOES WAY UP AND THEY REALLY WANT TO CONSUME FOOD THAT'S BECAUSE OF ITS EFFECTS ON INSOLENT AND ITS EFFECTS ON BLOOD SUGAR WHICH IS A SLIGHTLY SEPARATE MATTER BUT SINCE SOME OF YOU O PROBABLY YOUR MINDS MIGHT HAVE GONE ATIU TO THOSE EITHER EXPERIENCES OR REPORTS OF WHAT POT DOES O THAT'S WHY IT DOES THAT SO YOU'VE GOT THESE MOLECULES LIKE DOPAMNE THAT MAKE YOU FOCUSTD ON THE THINGS YOU WANT AN THE THINGS YOU CRAVE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE MOLECULES THAT MAKE YOU CONTENT WITH WHAT YOU HAVE SO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING PERHAPS IN CREATING A HEALTHY EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE IS TO HAVE A BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO NERMODULATOR SYSTEMS PEOPLE THAT ARE ALWAYS IN ANTICIPATION AND DESIRE AN SEEKING THAT'S WONDERFUL FOR PURSUING GOALS HOWEVER IT'S TERRIBLE FOR ENJOYING LIFE AND ACTUALLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE DIFFICULT TO BE AROUND THERE'S A CERTAIN ALMOST UMSOCIOPATHIC ELEMENT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WHAT THEY CALL HYPERDOPA MANERGIC PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS ON THE DOPA MANERGIC SCALE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE ALWAYS PURSUING GOALS IN FACT THOSE PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO BE A AT LEAST IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SPECTRUM THEY CAN BE VERY MANIPULATIVE YOU KNOW DOPAMINE AND THE PURSUIT OF SOMETHING DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE HIGH ENERGY AND INTENSE FROM THE OUTSIDE WHEN YOU OBSERVE IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IN FACT A THEIR PEOPLE WHO WILL MANIPULATE IN ORDER TO GET WHAT THEY WANT THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN WHO HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF DOPAMIN RELEASE IN THEIR BRAIN BUT THEY'VE LEARNED THAT A KIND OF PASSIVE MANIPULATION IS THE BEST WAY TO MANEUVER THROUGH A PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT I DO'T WANT TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON A SOCIOPATHY BECAUSE THOSE ARE KIND OF EXTREME EXAMPLES BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY A GOAL AND REALIZE THE SERIES OF STEPS THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL CAN NEITHER DO IT THROUGH ETHICAL MEANS OR NONETHICAL MEANS THEY CAN DO IT THROUGH ACTIVE PURSUIT BEING THE KIND OF TYPA PERSON THAT'S ALWAYS DECLARING THEIR GOALS AND GOING AFTER IT POSTING IT ON INSTRGAM TELLING EVERYBODY ABOUT IT TRYIND O RECRUIT OTHERS THERE'S THAT FINATYPE THERE'S THAT KIND OF SIGNATURE OF DOPAMNE AND THEN THERE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR DOING IT BY ALWAYS SERVING OTHER PEOPLE BY ALWAYS TAKING CARE OF EVERYBODY ELSE'S NEEDS BY ALWAYS TR IND TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS BUT THROUGH A MODE THAT AT LEAST FROM THE OUTSIDE SEEMS MORE PASSIVE OR MORE ABOUT SUPPORTING OTHERS NEITHER OF THESE ARE GOOD OR BAD AND THAT'S BECAUSE DOPAMNE IS A MOLECULE IT DOESN'T CARE HOW YOU REACH YOUR GOALS IT ONLY CARES THAT YOU REACH YOUR GOALS BECAUS THE SENTHE INTERNAL SENSATION IS ONE AGAIN OF MILD PLEASURE A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN ALTHOUGH MORE PAIN OVER TIME IF YOU'RE NOT REACHING THOSE GOALS AND IT TAKES YOU AWAY FROM THE HERE AND NOW SO AT ABOUT THIS POINT IN THE PODCAST I'M GUESSING THAT SOME OF YOU ARE THINKING O KET GREAT I WANT MORE DOPOMINE I WANT TO BE MORE MOTIVATED I DON'T WANT TO PRECRASTINATE AS MUCH AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE LIFE I WANT THESE HERE AND NOW MOLECULES TO BE RELEASED AS WELL WELL THERE IS A WAY TO DO THAT BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE SOURCE OF PRECRASTINATION IS NOT ONE THING THEY'RE BUSILY TWO KINDS OF PRECRASTINATORS OR SO SAYS THE RESEARCH THE FIRST KIND ARE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY REALLY ENJOY THEY STRESS OF THE IMPENDING DEADLINE IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN GET INTO ACTION THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY LIKE THE FEELING OF YOU KNOW SOMETHING BEING DO IN AN HOUR AND HOW ACTIVATED AND SHARP AN FOCUS THAT MAKES THEM FEEL THOSE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE TAPPING INTO THE EPANEFFERENT SYSTEM THE STRESS SYSTEM AND FOR WHICH THE STRESS REALLY TIGHTENS THEIR ABILITY TO SEE IT CREATES THAT SO DOSTRA VIEW OF THE WORLD IT CREATES AN ACTION ELEMENT IN THE BODY THAT MAKES THEM FEEL LIKE THEY WANT O MOVE IT REALLY ELIMINATES ALL THE DISCRAC E DISTRACTIONS FOR THEM SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEVERAGING STRESS INTERNAL STRESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A STATE THAT THEY CAN'T SEEM TO OTHERWISE ACHIEVE I WON'T TELL YOU WHAT TO DO IN ORDER TO OVERCOME ALL KINDS OF PRECRASTINATION BUT FROM A LOGICAL PERSPECTIVE IT MAKE SENSE THEREFORE FOR THOSE KINDS OF PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT OTHER WAYS THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR SYSTEM INTO ACTIVATION I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND PREVIOUS PODCAS BUT A COUPLE THOSE TOOLS MIGHT BE THE WHAT WE'VE CALLED SUPEROXYGENATION BREATHING WHICH I ADMIT IS NOT ALWAYS SUPEROXYGENATING SO THIS WOULD BE A IF YOU WANT DIDN'T WANT TO TO CONSUME ANYTHING THIS CAN BE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY CYCLES OF INDEEP INHALS AN EXALS IT'S LIKELY TO CREATE SOME ANXIETY AND A LOW LEVEL STRESS IF YOUARE SOME ONE WHOSE PRONE TO PANIC ATTACKS I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS BUT IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT WILL DEPLOY A DRENALINE INTO YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU WILL FIND THAT YOUR VISUAL FEELD IS FOCUSD AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AND FOCUS BETTER THAN IF YOU JUST KINT A WEIGHTED AROUND FOR SOME WAVE OF MOTIVATION TO TO WASH OVER YOU NORMALLY YOU'RE WAI TING FOR THAT DEADLINE TO COME INTO SIGHT AND THEN THAT'S WHAT THE STIMULUS IS BUT YOU CAN SELF DIRECT O DRENALINE RELEASE WITHOUT INGESTING ANYTHING YOU CAN ALSO INJEST COFFEE CAFFINE OR YOU MATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH IS WHAT I A PREFER VERY OFTEN TO COFFEE WHICH HAS KAFFINE CAFFINE DOES RELEASE DOPAOMINE AT LOW LEVELS HOW MUCH IT RELEASES DOPAMIE ISN'T CLEAR IT SEEMS TO INCREASE FIRING IN THESE NURONS IN THE NUCLEOUS ACCOMMENS BY ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT WHICH IS A PRETTY LOW LA VBEL BUT IT CANCREATE AGITATION SO FOR CAPINE SENSITIVE PEOPLE THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THINGS LIKE ELTYRACINE THE PRECURSOR O DOPAMINE OR MACUNAPURINES I TALK ABOUT THEN THE LAST EPISODE BUT IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT JUST TO REMIND YOU ELTYRACINE AS PRESENT IN RED MEATS ITS IN CERTAIN NUTS AND ELTYRACINE IS THE PRECURSOR TO DOPAMINE YOU CAN SUPPLEMENTS ALTYRACINE IF YOU LIKE YOU WILL GET A BIG INFLECTION AND DOPAMINE BUT THERE IS A CRASH ASSOCIATED WITH IT HOWEVER IT WILL INCREASE MOTIVATION IN THE SHORT TERM NOT SUGGESTING ANY ONE DO THIS I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR SAY WHAT I ALWAYS SAY AM NOT A DOCTOR I DON'T PROSCRIBE ANYTHING O'M A PROFESSOR A PROFESS THINGS YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHETHER NOT THESE THINGS OR APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR MENTALAN PHYSICAL HEALTH OR NOT SYOU NEED TO CONSULT THE DOCTOR FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SKITZATYPLE OR SKITZOPHRANIARMANIA SIOULD PROBABLY NOT BE TAKING PSUPPLEMENTS THAT INCREASE THER DOPAMINE LEVELS NOW IF YOU CAN'T INCREASE YOUR LEVEL OF POCUS AND YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND YOUR LEVEL OF MOTIVATION USING BREATHING WELL THEN THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE AT PLAY THERE ARE OTHER PROCRASTINATORS FOR WHICH THEY SIMPLY ARE NOT RELEASEING ENOUGH DOPAMINE THEY'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH DOPAMINE AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT CAN INCREASE DOPAMINE I DO SUGGEST YOU TALK TO PSYCHIATRIS OR DOCTOR I'VE TALKED ABOUT MACUNAPURINES WHICH IS NINETY NINE POINT NINE PER CENT EL DOPA THE PRECURS OR TO DOPAMINE SO THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DO MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY TAKE THINGS THAT INCREASE THEIR DOPAMINE LEVELS THERE ARE AND TO DEPRESCENCE LIKE WEL BUTRON PROU PRIORON WHICH INCREASE IS THE OTHER NAME FOR WHICH INCREASE DOPAMINE AND EPINEFERON IT CAN INCREASE RISK OF EPILEPTIC ATTACKS IF YOURE EPILEPTIC SO GANAF TO TALCTD YOUR DOCTOR BUT THEY WILL INCREASE DOPAMINAN AND MOTIVATION AND PHOCUS HOWEVER IF YOU THINK BACK T ARE EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT DOPAMINE DOPAMINE IF IT'S VERY HIGH CREATES A SENSE OF PLEASURE AN THE DESIGHER FOR MORE SO YOU CAN ALSO BECOME A PERSON FOR WHICH ENOUGH IS NEVER ENOUGH THE ONLY THING THAT DOPAMIN REALLY WANTS IS MORE OF THE THING THAT RELEASES DOPAMNE AND SO BIG IN FLECTIONS IN DOPAMINE WHETHER NOT THEY COME FROM COCANE OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY COME FROM A SUPPLEMENTATION CAPHIN EXERCISE STUDY REGINE WILL JUST MAKE YOU WANT MORE OF SOMETHING AND WE'VE ALL HEARD BEFORE OF GROTHMINE SET THIS INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY OF MY COLI CARAL DUEC OR SOME OF THESE POSITIVE MINE SETS THAT THE PSYCHOLOGY COMMUNITY HAS PUT FORTH AS REALLY GOOD FOR PURSUIT OF GOALS AND PURSUIT OF A THINGS THAT REQUIRE LONG BOUTS OF EFFORT WELL IT'S WONDERFUL IF YOU CAN LEARN TO ATTACH DOPAMINE TO THAT PROCESS PSYCHOLOGICALLY BUT IF YOU'RE STARTING TO AUGAMENT THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE THROUGH THINGS LIKE SUPPLEMENTATION AND PROSCRIPTION DRUGS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOURE NOT ONLY CAN NEED TO PURSUE MORE AND MORE OF THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH THE DOPAMINE SO MORE DOING MORE STUDYING MORE SPORT MORE PURSUIT HIGHER MOUNTAINS MORE MONEY MORE WHATEVER BUT WE KNOW THAT OVER TIME THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THAT THE PAIN OF LACK OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WILL ALSO INCREASE THIS IS THE PLEASURE PAIN RELATIONSHIP THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO IN A FEW MOMENTS I MIN A TALK ABOUT HOW TO THINK ABOUT HEALTHY DOPAMINE SCHEDULES BUT I JUST WANT TO TAKE A STEPBACK FOR SECOND AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THE FLIPSIDE OF DOPING WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE SO CALLED DOPAMINE CRASH WHAT MECHANISMS ARE INSTALLED IN US BECAUSE BELIEVE RE NOT THERE ARE MECHANISMS THAT ARE INSTALLED IN ALL OF US THAT REALLY PUT THE COMPLETE AND TOTAL BREAK ON DOPAMINE WITHER THERE AND WHAT THEY DO BECAUSE YOU'VE EXPERIENCE THESE BEFORE AND THEIR ACTUALLY WAYS THAT YOU CAN NAVIGATE THEM THESE DOPAMIN CRASHES OR THESE INTENTIONAL DOPAMIN SUPPRESSION MECHANISMS IN ORDER TO LEVIAGE HEALTHIER DOPAMIN SCHEDULES AND TO FEEL MORE MOTIVATED PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS IN ALL HUMANS IS THE NORL CIRCUITRY DESIGN FOR SEEKING OUT MATES AND FOR REPRODUCTION AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE CONTINUATION OF ANY ONE SPECIES IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR ANY SPECIES THAT'S JUST THE REALITY NOWI 'M REMOVING ALL CONTEXT HERE SO WHATEVER I SAY OF COURSE SITS IN THE IN THE YOUKNOWONABACKDROP OF YOU KNOW CONSENSUAL AGE APPROPRIATE A SPECIES APPROPRIATE A CONTEXT APPROPRIATE ALL OF THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE SOCIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION IN SEXES ABOUT THE BIOLOGY THE BIOLOGY OF SEX IN MALES AND FEMALES DOES MATTER OFIS EXEX CHROMAZOME ECS WHY CHROMOZOM EXEX WHY EXUIWIE DOESN'T MATTER THE REALITY IS THAT DOPAMING IS RELEASED ON ANTICIPATION AND CONSUMMATION OF SEX AND REPRODUCTION AND AFTER ORGASM REGARDLESS OF CHROMOZOMO BACKGROUND THERE IS A DRAMATIC DECREASE IN DOPAMINE AND IN INCREASE IN A HORMONE CALLED PROLACTON NOW PROLACTAN IS ASSOCIATED WITH MILK LET DOWN IN LACTATING MOTHERS ITS ALSO PRESENT IN MALES AND IN GENERAL PROLACTIN CREATES A SENSE OF LETHARGY OF STILLNESS AND LACK OF DESIRE TO MOVE AND LACK OF DESIRE TO PURSUE MORE OF WHATEVER RELEASED THE DOPAMINE PROLACTIN IN FACT SETS THE REFRACTORY PERIOD ON A MALES ABILITY TO MATE AGAIN NOW THIS IS GOING TO VERY TREMENDOUSLY FROM INDIVIDUAL TO INDIVIDUAL IT ALSO CAN OF THERE ARE DATA SHOWING THAT IT CAN VERY TREMENDOUSLY FROM MATE PARING TO MATE PARING THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT RELEASES DOPAMINE IS NOVELTY AND IT IS TRUE THAT THE REFRACTORY PERIOD IS SHORTEN BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NOVEL MATES THIS WAS FIRST SHOWN IN A CONECLASSIC EXPERIMENT IN A OF ALL THINGS IN CHICKENS THIS IS CALLED THE COOLAGE EFFECT AND THE STORY IS THE STORY GOES AND I BELIEVE ITS THE TRUE STORY ITS ACTUALLY IN ALL THE THE NORANICHRONOLOGY TEXT BOOKS SO I BELIEVE IT'S TRUE IS THAT PRESIDENT CALVAN COOLIGE WAS VISITING A CHICKEN FARM THEY WERE IS BEEN TAKEN AROUND AND THE PERSON WHO IS HOSTING THE VISIT SHOWED THEM A ROOSTER THAT WAS COOLEGE AND HIS WIFE WERE ON THE VISIT AND SAID THIS ROOSTER COPULATES THOUSANDS OF TIMES PER DAY AND MIS IS COOLEGE APPARENTLY AN A ELBOWED PRESENT COLEGENCEAT A YOU HEAR THAT CANLY POINTING OUT THE THE PROWESS OF THIS RUSTER AND COOLEGE SAID YET BUT LEME ASK A QUESTION SAME HEN OR DIFFERENT HENDS AND TURNS OUT TO IS DIFFERENT HENS AND THE REASON IS THE INTRODUCTION OF A NOVEL MATE INCREASES DOPAOMINE LEVELS AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT AFTER COPULATION PROLACTEN GOES THROUGH THE ROOF AND PREVENTS FURTHER COPULATION DOPAMINE CRASHES BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME SORT OF NOVELTY SHORTENS THIS NOW THIS IS NOT A APPLOY FOR A PEOPLE TO CHANGE MATES OFTIN WHAT THIS IS IS A STORY ABOUT THE DOPAMINE AND PROLACTIN SYSTEM THAT ALSO EXISTS IN HUMANS NOW THERE ARE ACTUALLY O THINGS THAT PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN COMMUNITIES TAKE IN ORDER TO BYPASS THESE REFRACTORY PEARIDS IS ECTUALLY IT DRUGS THAT INCREASE DOPAMINE SUPPRESS PROLACTIN AND VICE OF ERSA IS USSHI ANOTHER WAY TO SUPPRESS PROLACTIN VITEMIN BE SIX IS A FAIRLY POTENT PROLACTIN INHIBITER AS IS ZINC AND IF YOU LOOK OUT THERE IN THE LITERATURE AND FOR THOSE EITHER IN THE WELLNESS AND CONSPORTS PERFORMANCE COMMUNITY A LOT OF THE SO CALLED QUOTIN QUOTESTOSTERONE BOOSTERS ARE ACTUALLY COMMINATIONS OF VIDEMEN BE SIX AND ZINC WHICH INHIBIT PROLACTIN AND BY WAY OF INHIBITING PROLACTIN INCREASE DOPAMINE SO THEY DO HAVE SOME SOME YUNO FUNCTIONAL EFFACTIN THAT REGARD THEYRE NOT REALLY INCREASING TESTOSTERONE DIRECTLY THEIR SUPPRESSING PROLACTIN LEVELS AND THERE ARE CLINICAL CONDITIONS LIKE HYPEROPROLACTANEMIA WHICH LEADS TO MASSIVE DECREASES IN LEBIDO ET CETERA AND THERE ARE A PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO TREAT HYP A HYPEROPROLACTIN ANEMIA WHICH OF CORSE SHOULD YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TALK TO ANENTER CHRONOLOGISTS ABOUT THOSE SORTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT THIS VERY BASIC MECHANISM OF DOPOMNE AND PROLACTIN THIS SORT OF MOTIVATION NO NO MORE MOTIVATION IS A SYSTEM THAT EVOLVED FOR REPRODUCTION FIRST BUT THAT ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE AND YOU CAN SEE IN THELSEWHEREIN IN THE WORLD FOR INSTANCE SKITSOPHRENIA A DISEASE THAT HAS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES AND FACITS BUT SKITSOPHRENIA IS A CASE OF AN A OFTEN OF HYPERACTIVATION OF THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM SO MUCH SO THAT IT CAN MAKE PEOPLE FEEL CAN HIGH THEY HALLUCINATE I MEANRE TOK OF VERY VERY HIGH OR A A DISREGULATED A DOOMINES AS SORCITS IN THE BRAIN ONE OF THE TREATMENTS FOR SGETS APHRENIA ARE DRUGS THAT BLOCH DOPOMIN RECEPTERS AND O IF YOU HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE YOU KNOW THER SO MANY PEOPLE THERE OUT ON THE STREET THESE DAYS WHO HAVES GETS OPHRENIA SOME OF WHOM ARE TAKING THEIR MED SOME OF WHOM AREN'T IF YOU EVER SEE SOMEBODY ON THE STREET THAT'S DOING WHAT ITS LIKE A LIP SMACKING AND WRITHING ITS ACTUALLY CALLED TARDIVE DISCINESIA THIS IS A MOVEMENT DISO DISORDER THAT'S CREATED BY TAKING THESE ANTIDOPAMAN URGIC DRUGS S YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE ANTIDOPAMINURGIC DRUGS WHILE BEING VERY EFFECTIVE AND SUPPRESSING HALLUCINATIONS THEY CREATE THESE MOVEMENT PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF DOPAMINS IMPORTANCE FOR THE MOVEMENT CIRCUITRY SO CALLED PERAMETAL CIRCUITRY FOR THE OFPHYSIONATOS IN ADDITION YOU SOMETIMES SEE IN MALES THAT TAKE THESE DRUGS JOGKS LHI HALIPERADOL IN THE A AND THE OTHER DOPAMINE BLOCKERS THAT THEY ACTUALLY DEVELOP BREAST TISSUE GINACOMASTIA SO THE EVELOPMENT OF A MALE BREAST TISSUE IS BECAUSE OF THE ELEVATED LEVELS OF PROLACTIN BECAUSE THEIRE SUPPRESSING THEIR DOPAMINE SO MACH NOW THAT'S OF REALLY EXTREME CASE BUT A MAYBE PERHAPS IF YOU A IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY ENGAGING THESE VERY STRANGE KIND OF FACE SURWRITHING IN BODY WRITHING BEHAVIORS THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS THAT'S A CONSEQUENCE MOST OFTEN OF THE DRUGS THAT THEY'RE TAKING TO TREAT THE MENTAL ILNESS THOSE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF THOSE DRUGS NOW PROLACTIN IS INCREASED ANY TIME WE HAVE SOME REALLY HEIGHTENED INTENSE EXPERIENCE IS NOT JUST RELEASED AFTER SEXAN REPRODUCTION PROLACTIN IS RELEASED AFTER SOME MAJOR EVENT IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE ITS A THOUGHT FOR SOME OF A POSTPARDOM DEPRESSION FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF KIND OF THE THE LET DOWN THE LOW I CAN DISTINCTLY REMEMBER THAT AFTER FINALS A OR AFTER PUBLISHING A BIG PAPER I WOULD BE VERY VERY HAPPY BUT THEN I'D FIND THAT O YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT NEXT OR THINGS MIGHT SEEM A LITIBATE DIMMED OR DULLED OUT FOR THE NEXT DAY OR SO OR THE FOLLOWING WEEK THE TIME SCALES ON THESE ARE GOIN TO VERY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE RELEASE A LOT OF DOPAMINE FOR A VERY LONG TIME IN RESPONSE TO SOMETHING GREAT AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A QUICK INFLECTION OF DOAMINE AND THEN THEIR BACK TO FEELING NOT SO GREAT IT REALLY VARIES FROM PERSON OF PERSON IN FACT LONG AGO I STECAS I LEARNED ABOUT DOPAMIE REWARDS CIRCUITRY IN THE RELATIONSHIP WOU BE BETWEEN DOPAMINE AND PROLACTIN I STARD TO LEVERAGE THIS BELIEVE OR NOT AFTER SOME MAJOR EVENT I WOULD TAKE A COUPLE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF A VIDEMIN BE SIX I THINK FOR PEOPLE HAVE DIABETIC NAROPATHY YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH VITEMAN BE SIX A CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR I WAS TOLD ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T FOUND THE LITERATURE ON THIS THAT I CAN IN SOME CASES A EXASCERBATE PERFERAL NAROPATHY BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE A IT'S THOUGHT TO BE REASONABLY SAFE A BUT AGAIN ALWAYS CHECK A WITH YOUR PHYSICION BUT I WOULD TAKE SOME B SIX A KIND OF OFFSET SOME OF THAT LOW AND ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS SUBJECTIVE OR NOT BUT IT SEEM TO HAVE A SOMEWHAT OF A OF A POSIVE EFFECT I ALSO STARTED JUST INTERNALIZING THE FACT THAT DOPAMINE IS SO SUBJECTIVE THERE ARE OBJECTIVE ASPECTS TO DOPAMINE AND HOW MUCH IS RELEASED BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS TO DOPAMIE AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN ORDER TO GENERALLY JUST BE A HAPPIER PERSON ESPESCIALY IF YOUARE PERSON IN PURSUIT OF LONG TERM GOALS OF ANY KIND IS THE LONGER THAT YOU CAN EXTEND THAT POSITIVE PHASE OF THE DOPAMINE RELEASE AND THE MORE THAT YOU CAN BLUNT THE PAIN RESPONSE TO THAT THE BETTER AND YOU CANNOT SHALY DO THIS COGNIVELY I IUSED TO JOKE WITH MY LAB THAT WHEN WE'D PUBLISH A PAPER IW GET REALLY EXCITED BUT I WOULDN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO GET TOO EXCITED WHAT I WANTED TO DO INSTEAD AND WHAT I'VE STILL TRY TO DO AS TRYING EXTEND THE ARC OF THAT POSITIVE EXPERIENCE AS LONG AS I POSSIBLY CAN SIMPLY BY THINKING BACK LIKE O THIT WAS REALLY COOL I REALLY ENJOYD DOING THAT WORK I REALLY ENJOYED THE DISCOVERY I REALLY ENJOYED DOING THAT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT I WAS WORKING WITH AT THE TIME WHAT A PLEASURE THAT WAS I CAN GET THIS VERY EASILY FROM PICTURES OF PEOPLE AND THINGS LIKE COSTELLO THAT I REALLY ENJOY TRIPS THAT I'VE TAKEN SO YOU CAN EXTEND PLEASURE WITHOUT HAVING TO ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIOR OVER AND OVER THAT'S EXTENDING THE ARC OF THAT DOPAMINE RELEASE AS WELL IT OFFSET SOME OF THE PAIN OF NOT HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE OCCUR OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN NOW FOR THE HIGH PERFORMERS OUT THERE YOUR PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THIS MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BIG ACHIEVEMENT THEIR FIRST THOUGHTS ARE WILL NOW WHAT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NEXT HOW MI EVER GOING O EXCEED THAT AND INDEED MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY HIGH ON THIS KIND OF DOPAMINE SENSATION AND NOVELTY SEEKING SCALE ARE PRONE DOADDICTION THEIRE PRONE TO THE RABID PURSUIT OF EXTERNAL GOALS OF EXTERROCEPTION TO THE NEGLECT OF THESE INTERNAL MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO FEEL CALM AND HAPPY SO FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY DRIVEN VERY MOTIVATED ADOPTING A PRACTICE OF BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE HERE AND NOW THE SORT OF OMIN TIPT PRACTICES WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER O OF LEARNING HOW TO ACHIEVE A REALLY GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS THROUGH TOOLS AN MECHANISMS I TALKED ABOUT IN PREVIOUS PODCAS GIVES A SORT OF BALANCE TO THE PLEASURE SEEKING AND OFFSETTING OF PAIN AND THE PLEASURE IN THE HERE AND NOW SO PLEASURE IS REALLY TWO THINGS IT'S A JOY IN PURSUIT BUT IT'S ALSO THE JOY IN WHAT YOU HAVE AND THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL MODEL OF EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY ALLAN SHORE PROFESSOR AT YOU SEALA AND PSYCHIATRIS THE TALKS ABOUT SOME OF THE BASICS OF GOOD INFANT PARENT ATTACHMENT WHERE GOOD PARENTING THAT LEADS TO HEALTHY ADULT RELATIONSHIPS AND EMOTION REGULATION TENDS TO NCLUDE BOTH SIDES OF THIS DOPAMINE SERATONAN SPECTRUM YOU TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILD AND APPARENT TYPICALLY WAS THE MOTHER BUT ALSO FATHER WHERE YOU CAN GET THE CHILD REALLY EXCITED BY KIND OF SQUEALING AND RAMPING THEM UP AR TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING OR ICE SCREAM OR PLAY AND THE KID GETS VERY EXCITED THT'S THE DOPAMAN URGIC SYSTEM THE ANTICIPATION OF SOMETHING THAT'S COMING BUT AS WELL ENGAGING WITH CHILDREN IN A WAY THAT'S REALLY ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT IN THE HERE AND NOW THE READING OF THE BOOK THE KIDS ALWAYS SEEM TO ASK ONE MORE TIME ONE MORE THEY SEEM TO WANT MORE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY ENJOY BUT REALLY ENGAGING WITH THEM IN A WAY THAT ENCREASES THEIR SENSE OF PLEASURE FOR WHAT'S RIGHT THERE AS WELL AS GIVING THEM A LOT OF THINGS TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND POSITIVE ANTICIPATION NOW HAVING WORKD YEARS AGO WITH A ATRIS KIDS AND ALSO WITH YOUNG KIDS A SUMMER CAMPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU LEARN IS YOU NEVER SAY MAYBE TO A KID ABOUT A REWARD IF YOU SAY WE MIGHT HAVE ICE CREAM LATER YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY SAYING WE ARE HAVING ICE CREAM THEY DON'T HEAR THE MAYBE PART AND IT TURNS OUT ADULTS DON'T EITHER IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THERES SOMETHING ALLED REWARD PREDICTION ERROR I TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT DEEPLY IN THE CONTECTS OF THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM DOPAMINE AS I'VE SAID IS INVOLVED AN ANTICIPATION OF WANTING NOT OF HAVING IT'S INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION TOWARD THE THING THAT YOU WANT AND IT BIS US US TOWARDS ACTION WREWARD PREDICTION ERROR EQUALS THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE THAT'S RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO SOMETHING VERSES MINUS THE AMOUNT THAT'S EXPECT IT OKE SO IF YOU TELL A KID WE MIGHT HAVE ICE CREAM THAY HERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ICE CREAM AND TAY EXPECT IT AND IF YOU LATER SAY WELL WE'RE NOCK CAN HAVE ICE CREAM AND I SAID MAYBE THAT'S ASHECAN A LEAD TO A MUCH BIGGER CRASH IN DOPAMIE IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO A NEGATIVE SIGNAL A PUNISHMENT SIGNAL IT'S GOLITERALLY GOING TO FEEL LIKE PAIN SO KIDS YOU CAN LEVERAGE THIS IF YOUR PARENTS SAY MAYBE THERE EFFECTUALLY TELLING YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM ABSOLUTELY NOW ADULTS ARE LIKE THIS TOO IF WE THINK SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THERE'S A BIG CRASH IN OUR IN OUR AFFECT IN OUR EMOTIONALITY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT DOPAMINE SYSTEM GOES FROM FIRING ABOUT THREE TO FOUR TIMES PER SECOND TO ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN TIMES PER SECOND IN THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN POSSIBILITY IS DEEPLY WOVEN INTOUR BIOLOGY OF THE DOPAMINE AND MOTIVATION SYSTEM AS A WAY FOR US PRESUMABLY AN ANCIENT TIMES TO EXPLORE NOVEL TERRITORIES AND GET A SENSE THAT MAYBE THERE'S WATER THERE MAYBE THERE R MATES THERE MAYBE THERE'S BETTER FOOD THERE MAYBE THERE'S RESOURCS THERE THE MAYBE IS IMPORTANT THING THAT IN LANGUAGE TERMS MAYBE MEANS MAYBE BUT IN NUROBIOLOGICAL TERMS MAYBE MEANS PERHAPS THERE'S GOING TO BE THE SURPRISE OF AN EVEN BIGGER DOPAMINE REWARD AND THE ONE THING DOPAMINE LOVES MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS SURPRISE WHEN WE GET SOMETHING PAUSE WE GO TO THE MAL BOX OR EXPECTING SEM BILLS AND YOU OPEN IT UP AND YOU GET A LETTER FROM SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN A LONG TIME AND YOU ADORE THAT PERSON THAT'S A HUGE DOPAMINE RELEASE IT ACTUALLY TRIGGER'S NORAL PLASTTY YOU PROBABLY NEVER FORGET THAT BECAUSE THE WAY THAT DOPAMINE GATES PLASTICITY WHEN WE GET A A SURPRISE OF SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T WANT ALSO IT CREATES PLASTICITY SO THE SURPRISE NOVELTY MOTIVATION AND REWARD THERE ALL WOVEN IN TO THIS PACKAGE THAT WE CALL DOPAMIE AND THE COOL THING IS YOU CAN ACTUALLY REGULATE THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WILL STEER YOU OR LEAN YOU TOWARDS MORE POSITIVE ANTICIPATION OF THINGS IN LIFE AND LESTISAPPOINTMENT IT'S SIMPLY MATTER OF A JUSTING WHAT WE CALL THE DOPAMINE SCHEDUL  COUPLE THINGS BEFORE WE CONTINUE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ATTENTION DEFICIT IN A FEW MINUTES BUT BEFORE THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I MENTION NG BEFORE IN PREVIOUS PODCASTS BUT THAT YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF AND IF YOU'RE AWARE OF YOU MAY STILL BE DOING WHICH IS SEVERELY INJURING YOUR ABILITY TO RELEASE DOPAMINE IT'S CREATING A SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN WAYS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY HURTING YOU MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY AND THATS THE BLUNTING OF DOPAMINE BY VIEWING LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I REALIZE THIS IS NOT DISCUSSION ABOUT SLEEP IN CIRCATING RHYTHMS BUT THE DATA NOW ARE SO STRONG SHOWING THAT VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHT FROM ABOUT TEN PIM TO FORE AM TOO OFTEN TRIGGER'S ACTIVATION OF THE CIRCUIT CALLED THE HABENULA SO THIS IS I TO GOES FROM URETNA TO STRUCTURE CALL THE HABENULA  H  B E ND U ALE THEN FROM THE HABENULA TO SOME OF THIS REWARD CIRCUITRY AND IT SUPPRESSES THE ACTIVATION OF THE REWARD CIRCUITRY NOT JUST IN THAT MOMENT BUT TO THINGS THAT YOU NORMALLY POSITIVELY ANTICIPATE AND PURSUE AND THE RESOMBERING THIS UP NOW AS CAUSE I HAVEN'T REALLY GONE INTO DEPTH ON THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM BEFORE NOW YOU UNDERSTANDOU HAVE THIS VERY PRECIOUS REWARD SYSTEM THAT'S KIND OF A DOUBLE LEDGE SORED IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND TREATED WELL YOU WANT TO USE IT BUT NOT OVER USE IT ET CETERA BUT GETTING BRIGHT LIGHT EXPLOSURE IN TH MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS REDUCING YOUR CAPACITY TO RELEASE DOPAMI SO'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE SLEEP THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING IN THAT TIME IT'S ALSO THAT YOU'RE NOT A GETTING  THE DOPAMINE THAT'S OF THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO YOU SE YO'RE ACTUALLY TAKING THINK OF LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE O THE NIGHT AS AT KIND OF ANTAGONISTS THIS KIND OF A BLOCKER OF DOPAMINE MAYBE THAT I'LL HELP YOU IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOU HAS TO WORK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND YOU WANT A BY PASS THIS DOPAMINE SUPPRESSION PLESEE THE EPISODE ABOUT JETLAG AND SHIFT WORK BECAUSE THEIR LOT O TIPS THERE THAT WILL LOW YOU TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO CONTROL THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM HAD A LEVERAGE IT FOR A BETTER LIFE YOU NEEDN'T UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF A VERY IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT THIS EXPERIMENT WAS HABLE TO SEPARATE PLEISURE FROM MOTIVATION IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BUT LIKE MANY SIMPLE EXPERIMENTS OF VERY ELEGANT EXPERIMENT WHAT THEY DID AND THIS HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN ANIMALS AND INHUMANS THEY OFFERED RATS FOOD IT WAS A FOOD THAT THEY PARTICULARLY LIGHE AND THE ANIMALS WOULD LEVER PRESS FOR A PELET OF FOOD CON A CLASSIC EXPERIMENT IT EAT THE FOOD AND THEY PRESUMABLY LIKE THE FOOD BECAUSE THEY WERE MOTIVEEY DEPRESS TE LEVER AND EAT IT GREAT THEY TOOK OTHER RATS THEY ELIMINATED THE DOPAMINE NURONS YOU CAN DO THIS BY INJECTION OF A NEUROTOXIN THAT DESTROYS THESE NURONS SO THY ACTUALLY HAD NO DOPAMINE IN THEIR BRAIN THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO RELEASE DOPAMINE AND THEY GAVE THEM A LEVER THAT RATS WOULD SIT THERE AND THEY HIT THE LEVER AND THEY EAT THE FOOD THEY'RE STILL ENJOYED THE FOOD S YOU SAY WELL O CASE HE DOPOMINE ISN'T INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION AND IS INVOLVED IN PLEASURE NO IT ABSOLUTELY IS THEY COULD STILL ENJOY THE FOOD BUT IF THEY MOVED THE RAT LITERALLY ONE BODY LENGTH AWAY FROM TAE LEVER WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THE ANIMALS THAT HAD DOPAMINE WOULD MOVE OVER TO LEVER PRESS IT AND EAT AND THE ONES THE RATS THAT DID NOT HAVE DOPAMINE AVAILABLE TO THEM WOULDN'T EVEN MOVE ONE BODYLENGTH ONE RAT LENGTH TO THE LEVER IN ORDER TO PRESS IT AND GET THE FOOD DOPAMINE THEREFORE IS NOT ABOUT THE ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE IT IS ABOUT MOTIVATION FOR PLEASURE THIS HAS BEEN REPEATED IN CUMANS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CYNAREOS YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THE LEVER PRESS THING QUITE AS EASILY BUT WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ARE SIMPLY LESS MOTIVATED EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN ACHIEVE PLEASURE AND THIS HAS SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE FACT THAT NOW QUOTEN QUO PLEASURE OR WAYS TO INDUCE THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE GIVE US PLEASURE AR EVERYWHERE AND THERE WITHIN REACH WE DON'T HAVE TO FORAGE FOR OUR FOOD THERE'S LOT OF OF HIGHLY PROCESSD HIGH SUGAR HIGH FAT FOODS THERE'S ALSO FOODS THEIR HEALTHY THAT TASTES GOOD BUT THERE AND HOPEFULLY THEIR PRETTY EASY TO GET OR THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFERENT ACCESS TO THINGS OF COURSE BUT DOPAMINE ISN'T ABOUT THE ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE IT'S ABOUT HOW MOTIVATED YOU ARE TO REACH THOSE PLEASURES AND SO MANY OF YOUR POLYTHINKING WILL I'M NOT A VERY MOTIVEATED PERSON LIKE YOU TALK ABOUT THE ONE KIND OF PROPASTINATION EARLI ER WHAT ABOUT WHEN I JUST FEEL CINOMEC ABOUT LIFE NOW ITFOR SOME OF YOU THERE MAY BE A REAL CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND YOU SHOULD TALK TO A PROFESSIONAL THERE ARE VERY GOOD PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE THERE'S ALSO GREAT NON DRUG TREATMENTS OF A PSYCHOTHERAPE AND OTHER TREATMENTS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN ADDITION A PSYCHOTHERAPE IN THE VARIOUS KINDS OF PSYCHONALYSIS ET CETERA THAT ONE CAN USE I THINK THE DATA REALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT A COMMINATION OF PHARMOCOLOGY AND TALK THERAPES ARE GENERALLY BEST AND THERE ARE A HUGE RANGE OF THESE THINGS I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE IN THESE PROFESSIONS WERE NOT CAN TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW THEREIS A COMPOUND THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING IN THE SUPPLEMENT SPACE THAT ISN'T A MACUNIPURIANS ELL DOPA IT'S NOT ELTYRACINE THAT ISN'T PROMOTING MASSIVE RELEASES OF DOPAMINE OR EVEN DOPAMIE ALONE BUT A COMMINATION OF DOPAMINE AND CERATONAN AND IT'S AN INTRIGUING MOLECULE IT'S A SOLD OVER THE COUNTER GANYAV THA CHECK WITH YOUR HALTH CARE A A PROVIDER BEFORE YOU WOULD TAKE ANYTHING OR REMOVE ANYTHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHICH IT BUT IT'S A FENAL ETHELE FENAL ETHEL AMIN OR P E A P A OR BATA FENAL ETHEL AMING RELEASES DOPAMINE AT LOW LEVELS BUT ALSO SERATONINANT LOW LEVELS SO IT'S KIND OF A COCKTAIL OF THE MOTIVATION MOLECULES AS WELL AS THE QUOTE AN QUOTE HERE AND NOW MOLECULES AND PEOPLES RESPONSE THIS VARIES WIDELY BUT MANY PEOPLE REPORT FEELING HEIGHTEN SENSE OF MENTAL ACUITY WELL BEING ET CETERA IT IS A BIT OF A STIMULANT LIKE ANYTHING THAT TRIGGER'S ACTIVATION THE DOPAMINE AND NORA AN EFFEREN PATHWAY BUT IS AN INTERESTING SUPPLEMENT I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T TRIED IT BEFORE AM SO I CAN'T REPORT ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES I WILL POINT YOU HOWEVER TO EXAMINE DOK KAM IT WOULDN'T BE A HUBERMAN LADPODCAST EPISODE IF I DIDN'T POINT YOU TO EXAMINED OT COMNIS INCREDIBLE FREE RESOURCE WHERE YOU CAN PUT IN ANY SUPPLEMENT AND IT WILL TELL YOU THAET QUOTE INQUOTE HUMAN AFFACT MATRICKS THAT'LL POINTYOU TO THE VARIOUS STUDIES WE ALWAYS PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS IN THE CAPTION ITS AN AMAZING RESOURCE SO YOU CAN GO THERE TO EXPLORE MORE BUT I HAVEN'T TALK ABOUT A BAT A FENAL L ETHEL AMN BEFORE IN PREVIOUS PODCAST AND I WANTED TO ADD IT TO TH AM LIST OF THINGS THAT TAP IN TO THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM THAT ARE A IN THIS I GUESS WE CALL IT DOWN THE SUPPLEMENTATION SPACE I PERSONALLY INFASCINATED BY THESE SUPPLEMENTS AND THE THINGS THAT EXIST OUT THERE THAT ARE NONPRESCRIPTION THAT SEEM TO AT LEAST ANCE SOME PEOPLE HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS A FOR INSTANCE LAST EPISODE WE TALKED ABOUT A SEDAL AL CARNATINE WHICH A THERE SEVERAL PAPERS THAT REPORT ANTI DEPRESSIN EFFACTS AS WELL AS PASIVE EFFECTS ON OTHER THINGS A SPIRM HEALTH OVARIAN HEALTH ET CETERA I LEARN FROM A COLLEAGUE THAT A SEDAL EL CARNATINE IN EUROPE IS ISH PRESCRIPTION DRUG AN THE U S ITS SOLD OVER THE COUNTER SO I GUESS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS THE AVAILABILITY MIGHT VERY AND AS ALWAYS I PUT THE CAVIAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK WITH YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF ITS RIGHT FOR YOU BUT I'M FASCINATED BY THE FACT THAT THESE THINGS EXIST AND THAT THEY LIE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND DOING NOTHING AND THAT MAKES THEM P A INTERESTING COMPOUNDS AND I THINK THAT P  A A BATAPHENAL ETHELAMIN IS A YET ANOTHER ONE OF OF SUCH COMPOUNDS I GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT ATTENTION DEFISIT AND ATTENTION DEFIS AT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER IN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT I DO WANT O MENTION IT TO DAY IN THE CONTECTS OF DOPOMINE AND IMPULSIVITY SO EIGHT  T OR  D D SO ATTENTION DEFIS IT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER  D D ARE CLINICAL DIAGNOSES I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE NOWDAYS WALK ROUND AND SAY I AV A D D OR YOU HAVE  D D AM AND INDEED ONE CAN CREATE A SORT OF  D D BY ATTENTION SWITCHING ALL THE TIME A I'M A BIG FAN OF CALNEWPORT HE WROTE THE BOOK DEEP WORK HE A I BELIEVE HE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID CONTECT SWITCHING IS IS TERRIBLE FOR THE BRAIN ITS LIKE THE WORST THING FOR THE BRAIN BECAUSE THEN THE BRAIN LEARNS TO CONTECTS WHICH AND REAL DEEP WORK PRODUCTIVIT LEARNING OF ALL KINDS GOOD RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL CKINDS REALLY COME FROM DEPTH OF EXPERIENCE NOT FROM A BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE MOMENT AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S CLINICAL HD  T ND  D D AND THEN THERE'S THE KIND THAT PEOPLE ARE KIND OF INDUCING A AND THROUGH DISTRACTION AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND PHONES ET CETERA AND THOSE CAN SOMETIMES LEAD TO CLINICAL EIGHT EIGH C AN EIGHD D BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HTD H D AND  D D IN KIDS JUST BRIEFLY THE DRUGS THAT ARE NORMALLY GIVEN TO TREAT THOSE CONDITIONS HT  D AND  D D ARE THINGS LIKE ATERALL THINGS THAT HAVE VERY EMPHEDEMINE LIKE QUALITIES AND STRUCTURES AND YOU MIGHT ASK WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT WHILL TURNS OUT THAT IN KIDS THESE ACTIVATE THAT FOUR BRAIN CIRCUITRY THE BREAK THAT EXISTS ON THE DEEPER A MESOLYMBICS CIRCUITRY SO AS RECALL THEIRS THE VITA AND NUCLYSECOMBENS DOS THE KIND OF ACCELERATORS ON DOPAMINE AND THEN THERE'S THE PREFRONT OF QUARTECTS WHICH ACTS AS A BREAK AND CAN LIMIT IMPULSIVITY AND THOSE DRUGS TEND TO INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS IN THAT PATHWAY THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEC AND IT REDUCES IMPULSIVITY IN FACT THERE'IS AY EXPERIMENT DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK THE MOLECULE OF MORE WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING WHERE THEY LOOKED AT IMPULSIVITY IN OBIS CHILDREN AND IT TURNS OUT ON THEY DO THIS EXPERIMENT IN A SAFEWAY THAT THEY LOOKED AT KIDS ON BOTH OBS KIDS AND NONOBEST KIDS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CROSS A VERY BUSY HIGHWAY AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OBES KIDS GOT HIT BY CARS MORE OFTEN THAN A NON OBS A CHILDREN AND TURNS OUT THIS WAS THE VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIMENT THAY HAD NOTHIN DO WITH THE FACT THAT THEY WERE OBES OR OR LIMITATIONS ON MOVEMENT OR SPEED OF MOVEMENT IT WAS THAT THE OBS CHILDREN WERE MORE IMPULSIVE IN A VARIETY OF CONTECTS NOCIOUS IN THIS VIRTUAL CROSSING THE STREET THING AND IT TURNS OUT A THE DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT IMPULSIVITY AT AGE TEN IS ACTUALLY PREDICTIVE OF OVEREATING DISORDERS AT A LATER STAGE IN LIFE SO SOME OF THESE DRUGS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO CREATE HEIGHTENED ACTIVITY IN THE BREAKING SYSTEM THE DCELERATOR OF THE REWARD PATHWAY ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE IMPULSIVITY BECAUSE THEY SUPPRESS THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE AND THEY ALLOW HOPEFULLY THEY ALLOW CHILDREN AND AND WHEN THEY BECOME ADULTS TO BETTER CONTROL THE SCHEDULE OF DOPAMINE RELEASE SO NOW LATS TALK ABOUT WHAT IS A DOPAMIN SCHEDUL AND HOW YOU CAN LEVERAGE THIS IN ORDER TO HAVE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF MOTIVATION BUT NOT GET SO MUCH DOPAMING THAT YOUR EXPERIENCEI AR CRASH AFTERWARDS AND ALSO SO THAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE HEIGHTEN PLEASURE FROM THE VARIOUS PURSUITS THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED IN IN LIFE I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BE MORE MOTIVATED TO FOCUS LONGER SLEEP BETTER THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST IS ALL ABOUT BUT ALWAYS FRAMED IN THE CONTECTS OF NUROBIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVE MECHANISMS THERE ARE SOME TOOLS THAT WE CAN APPLY TO THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM AND MOTIVATION THAT CAN REALLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO STAY IN PURSUIT OF THINGS AS WELL AS INJOY THINGS AFTER WEVE ACHIEVED OUR GOALS OR EVEN IN RUTAR GOALS AND HERE'S THE KEY PRINCIPLE DOPAMINE IS VERY SUBJECTIVE MEANING YOU CAN EITHER ALLOW YOURSELF TO EXPERIENCE THE PLEASURE OF REACHING A MILESTONE OF ACHIEVING OR SOME CRAVING OR NOT NOW THAT WON'T WORK IN THE EXTREME CASES OF DRUGS LIKE COCANE AND EMPHETI MING BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY POWERFUL WHAT ONE CAN DO WITH THE SUBJECTIVE SYSTEM FACT OMANITE DESTRIBE YOU AN EXPERIMENT THAT HIGHLIGHTS JUST HOW POWERFUL THET SUBJECTIVE READ OUT OR THE SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF A GIVEN EXPERIENCE REALLY CAN BE EVEN AT THE LEVEL OF FARMOCOLLEGY I LOVE EXAMPLES OF SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OVER THINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SEEM HARD WIRED BECAUSE THEY REALLY ILLUSTRATE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARE COGNITION ARE BELIEF SYSTEM AND WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE THESE YOU KNOW JUST PLUGIN CHUG KIND OF MECHANISMS OF YOU KNOW YOU EAT EX AMOUNT OF CHOCOLATE OR YOU DRINK EX AMOUNT OF WATER AFTER BEING WATER DEPRIVED FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME HEN YOU GET EX AMOUNT OF DOPEMINE HERE'S THE EXPERIMENT THEY EXPERIMENT WAS JUST PUBLISHED ON MARCH EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO VERY RECENTLY AND THE TITLE OF THE EXPERIMENT IS EXPECTATION FOR STIMULANT TYPE MODIFIES KAFFINE'S EFFECTS ON MOOD AND COGNITION THIS WAS DONE IN COLLEGE STUDENTS IT'S A FASCINATING STUDY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY GAVE COLLEGE STUDENTS EITHER PLASIBO ESSENTIALLY NOTHING OR TWO HUNDRED MELIGRAMS OF KAFFINE TWO HUNDER MELIGRAMS A KAFFINE IS ABOUT WHAT'S IN A WELL A A TYPICAL COFFEE LIKE A MEDIUM COFFE THAT YOUBY A DRIPP COFFEE OR A TE COFFE THAT YOU'D MAKE AT HOME IT'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF KAFFINE IF YOU WERE TO TAKE IN PILL FORM IT WOULD DEFLY MAKE YOU FEEL MORE ALERT UNLESS YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE ON MUTENTS LITERALLY MUTENTS THAT O IS INSENSITIVE TO KAFFINE IN THOSE MUTENTS ARE PRETTY RARE SO THEY TOOK SIXTY FIVE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN COLLEGE THEY RANDOMIZE THEM TO EITHER PLASIBO OR KAFFINE AND THEY TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE EITHER GETTING KAFFINE OR ATARAL NOW ATERAL COGNITIVELY CARRIES A VERY DIFFERENT OF EXPECTATION COLLEGE STUDENTS KNO ATERALL TO BE A MUCH STRONGER STIMULANT THAN KAFFINE THEY KNOW IT TO CREATE A SORT OF HIGH THIS IS THE WAY THE STUDENTS DESCRIBED IT AND THEY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD INCREASE THEIR LEVEL OF FOCUS AND THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM WORK SO WAS REALLY INTERESTING IS THE WAS DEFFLI AN EFFECT OF PLASIBO VER SAYS KAFFIN THAT'S NOT SURPRISING HOWEVER RIGHT IN TAKE A PLASEBO YOU MAYERE MAY NOT FEEL MORE ALERT A BUT YOU TAKE TWO UNDER MELIGRAMS A KAFINE VERY LIKELY GU NA FEEL VERY LERT BUT THERE WAS ALSO AN EFFECT OF WEATHER NOT THE STUDENTS THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING KAFFINE OR ATARAL THE SUBJECTS RECEIVING KAFFINE REPORTED FEELING MORE STIMULATED ANXIOUS AND MOTIVATED THAN THE SUBJECTS THAT RECEIVE THE PLACIBO OKE BUT THE ONES THAT EXPECTED ATARL REPORTED STRONGER AND FEDOMING EFFECTS SO THEY FELT MUCH MORE HIGH THEY PERFORMED BETTER ON A WORKING MEMORY TEST AND IN GENERAL THEY HAD ALL THE INCREASED COGNATIVE EFFECTS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN WITH ATARAL BUT THEY WERE ONLY IN JESTING KAFFNE AND SO THIS SHOWS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN THE DROG KAFFINE AND THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WAS ATARAL SO IT LED TO HEIGHTEN PERFORMENTS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE STUDENTS THOUGHT THEY WE GETTING ATARAL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER R NOT THEY A TOLD THEM AT THE END THAT IT WASN'T AT ARALL I DOUBT THAT THEY DID THIS IF YOU WANT TO LOOK IT UP A THE STUDY WAS A PUBLISH IN THE A THE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CLINICAL OF PSYCHOPHARMOCHOLOGY ON THE PAPER IS LUBI AT ALL L O OB WY AT ALL AND AGAIN IT WAS JUST PUBLISHED OF MARCH EIGHTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT YES THERE ARE SO CALLED PLACIBO EFFACTS BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN PLACIBO THIS IS A BELIEF EFFACT ABOUT WHAT THE SPECIFIC REACTIONS TO A GIVEN STIMULANT OUGHT TO BE AND I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE THE THE TOP DOWN THE KIND OF HIGHER LEVEL COGNIVE PROCESSES ARE IMPACTING EVEN THE MOST BASIC FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE SAY DOPAMIN RELES SOERRARE AMOUNT A A DRENALIN RELEASE ARE UPANEFHRAN RELEASE IN WAYS THAT CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT PERFORMANCE IN THIS CASE IT WAS A POSITIVE IMPROVEMENT IN WORKING MEMORY AND FOCUS AS LONG AS WERE TALKING ABOUT KAFFINE I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT A STUDY THATS REALLY INTERESTING THIS WAS PUBLISHIN JOURNAL OF NEROL SCIENCE WHICH IS THE SOCIETY FOR NERO SCIENCES CAN FLAGSHIP JOURNAL IS THEIR JOURNAL OISGOOD JOURNAL AND WHAT THEY SHOWED WAS THAT KAFFINE CAN INCREASE DOPAMING RELEASE IN THE BRAIN BY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT THAT WAS IT SURPRISING I EVEN SAID THAT EARLIER BUT WHAT THEY ALSO SHOWED IS THAT IT HAS A PROTECTIVE OF FACT ON DOPAMIN NURONS SO KAFFINE IN SOME CASES MAY NOT JUST INCREASED DOPAMING RELEASE BUT IT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A PROTECTIVE EFFECT ON DOPAMINE NURONS NOW THAT'S DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM SOME CLAIMS THAT DRUGS LIKE M DIAMA ECSTASY HAVE BEEN ITS BEEN ARGUED CAN ARE NUROTOXIC FOR THINGS LIKE DOPAMINE AND SERETONAN NURONS THE STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED ABOUT THAT IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE WHICH IS AN EXTREMELY PRESTIGIOUS EXCELLENT JOURNAL LATER IT WAS SHOWN THAT IT WAS AN M DI AMA ECSTASY THAT WAS GIVEN ON IN THAT CASE IT WAS ACTUALLY EMPHETAMINE WHICH IS KNOWN TO DESTROY DOPAMANURGIC AND SERETONURGEC NURONS SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS THAT LOW LEVELS OF KAFFINE MAY AT LEAST IN A FEW STUDIES BE PROTECTIVE FOR DOPAMINE NURONS OVER TIME THAT M DI MA ECSTASY SOMETHING THATS INCLINICAL TRIALS RIGHT NOW FOR THE TREATMENT OF TROMA PITIAST OF VARIOUS KINDS AND DEPRESSION BUT STILL ILLEGAL AT THIS POINT IN TIME A MAY ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T APPEAR YET FROM ANY PUBLISHED STUDIES DESTROY DOPAMANURGIC NURONS PERHAPS SO RGHANURGEC NURONS SO AT THERE'S A REAL ASTRICTS IN A QUESTION MARK THERE BUT MPHEDAMINE AN IN PARTICULAR METHEMPHED PEDAMINE IS VERY DESTRUCTIVE FOR DOPAMANURGENCT NURONS SO I DON'T THINK  ANY OF US NEEDED ANY ADDITIONAL REASONS TO AVOID METHEMPHEDAMINE A THIS DRUG THAT CREATES HUGE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE AND THEN HUGE CRASHES FROM THAT DOPAMINE VERY DESTRUCTIVE DRUG BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT SEEMS TO DESTROY DOPAM AN URGECT NURONS FROM TIME TO TIME I'VE TALKED ABOUT NICOTINE ON HERE NOT SMOKING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY SMOKING IS BAD LUNG CANCERS BAD A FOR HEALTH AT CETERA ON BUT NICOTINE ITS IN SUPPLEMENTAL FORM I'VE MENTION THAT A VERY FAMOUSTS NOR A SCIENTISTS NO ABOUT PRIZE WINNING SCIENTISTS A CHOOSE A LOT AN NICARAT I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE O CHUNICARETE OM THEY BELIEVE IN ITS NARROW PROTECTIVE EFFECTS FOR PARKINSONS AND ALCHIMERS AND INDEED NICOTINE CAN STIMULATE DOPAMIN RELEASE WE TALKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER WHETHER NOT HAS A PROTECTIVE EFFECT ISN'T CLEAR THE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS MIGHT BE THROUGH THE NORADRONERGIC AND A SEAT OF COLINE SYSTEMS THOSE FINDINGS ARE STILL UNCLEAR BUT IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT NICOTINE CAN INCREASE PROLACTIN SOMEWHAT THERE ARE COUPLE STUDIES I BE HAPPY TO LINK TO THEM IN THE CAPTION THAT SHOWS THAT NICOTINE TAKEN TOO MUCH OVER TOO LONG PERIODS OF TIME CAN ALSO INCREASE PROLACTIN WHICH AGAIN IS THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF DOPAMINE SO TO DAY WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM AND AND THOSE KINDS OF SCHEDULS THAT WILL LOW CRAVING OR A DICTION BUT WHAT'S THE SCHEDUL OF DOPAMINE THAT'S GOING TO LOW YOU TO MAXIMIZE ON YOUR PURSUIT OF PLEASURE AND YOUR ELIMINATION OF PAIN AND WE GET THE ANSWER TO THAT FROM OUR GOOD FRIEND GAMBLING THE REASON GAMBLING WORKS THE REASON WHY PEOPLE WILL THROW THEIR LIVES AWAY THE REASON WHY PEOPLE GO BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO PLACES LIKE LOSS VAGUS IN ATLANTIC CITY IS BECAUSE OF THE HOPE AND ANTICIPATION IT'S AS THOSE ARE CITIES AND PLACES BUILT ON DOPAMINE I DON'T THEY ARE LEVERGING YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM AND I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE EXPERIENCED GAMBLERS THEIR PEOPLE THAT ENJOY GAMBLING ALLACTUALLY JUST SAY IN I LIKE SITTING AT THE RULETTE TABLE I WAS TAKE A DESIGNAT AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S NOT MUCH I ENJOY PLAYING A LO BIT OF RULETTE I CERTAINLY ENJOY WHEN I WIN I CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I LOSE BUT I DO IT SEERLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING AND I DO IT VERY SELDOM I DON'T HAVE A GAMBLING PROBLEM AND IF I DID I PROBLY TELL YOU BUT I DON'T HAVE A GAMBLING PROBLEM YET PEOPLE THROW AWAY THE ENTIRE LIVES ON GAMBLING AND AS A FRIEND OF MINE WHOSE A CERTIFIED ADICTION TREATMENT SPECIALISTS TELLS ME THAT YOU A GAMBLING ADDICTION IS A PARTICULARLY SYNISTER BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME REALLY COULD BE THE THING THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING UNLIKE OTHER EDDICTIONS THE NEXT TIME REALLY COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING AND THAT'S IMBEDDED IN THE MIND OF THE GAMBLING ATIC AND RARELY DOES IT WORK OUT A IN FAVOR OF THE WELL BEING OF THE GAMBLING ATTICT AND THEIR FAMBLING HOWEVER THE INTERMITTENT REENFORCEMENT SCHEDUL WAS DISCOVERED LONG AGO BY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHERS SO THIS IS THE SLOT MACHINE THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE GIVES YOU A WIN TO KEEP YOU PLAYING THIS IS THE THE PROBABILITY OF WINNING ON THE CRAPS TABLE OR THE RULETTE TABLE OR AT BLACKCHACK JUST OFTEN ENOUGH THE YOU'RE WILLING TO BY TICKETS HEAD OUT THERE PLAY AGAIN GO DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN FROM YOUR ROOM EVEN THOUGH YOU SWERE YOU WERE DONE FOR THE NIGHT INTERMITTANT REENFORCEMENT IS THE MOST POWERFUL FORM OF DOPAMINE REWARD SCHEDUL TO KEEP YOU DOING SOMETHING SO WE CAN EXPORT THAT WE CAN USE IT FOR GOOD IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'R PURSUING IN LIFE WHETHER NOT IT'S AN ACADEMIC GOAL OR FINANCIAL GOAL OR RELATIONSHIP GOAL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO INSURE THAT YOU WILL REMAIN ON THE PATH TO THAT GOAL FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO EXCEED YOUR PREVIOUS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE DOPAMINE RELEASE THAT OCCURS WHEN YOU HIT THE MILESTONES THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE IS TO OCCASIONALLY REMOVE REWARD SUBJECTIVELY LET SAY YOU SET OUT A GOAL OF MAKING OM O MAKE THIS QUANTITATIVE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCESAS AGUS AS EASY DESCRIPTION BUT THIS COULD ALSO BE IN SPORT THIS COULD BE IN SCHOOL THIS COULD BE IN MUSIC COULD BE IN ANYTHING CREATIVE ENDEAVORS BUT LET SAY YOU SET OUT A CERTAIN FINANCIAL GOAL OR LET SAY YOU WANT TO GET CERT NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS ON WHATEVER SOCIAL MEDIATE PLATFORM AS YOU REACH EACH ONE OF THOSE GOALS YOU SHOULD KNOW NOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE IS NOT GOING TO PEIK ITS ASHULGAN TO DIMINISH AND MAKE YOU CREATE MORE THE KEY TO AVOIDING THAT CRASH BUT TO STILL KEEP IT IN HEALTHY LEVELS THAT WIL ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR PURSUIT IS AS YOU ARE STAIRCASE IN TOWARD YOUR GOAL MAYBE THAT'S DOLLARS MAYBE THAT'S FOLLOWERS MAYBE THAT'S GRADES MAYBE THAT SOME OTHER METRIC IT'S METALS OR TROPHIES YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO BLUNT THE REWARD RESPONSE FOR CSOME OF THOSE INTERMEDIATE GOALS NOW'M NOT TELLING YOU SHOULDN CELEBRATE YOUR WINDS BUT I'M TELLING YOU NOT TO CELEBRATE ALL OF THEM OR AS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO A RECENTLY A FORTUNATELY FOR HIM A HAD A GREAT FINANCIAL SUCCESS HE ASKED ME AND SOMEBODY ELSE A GOOD FRIENDOMINE WHOSE VERY TUNED IN TO DOPAMINE REWARD SCHEDULES UNDERSTANDS HOW THEY WORK AT A REALLY DEEP LEVEL AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT AND WE SAID OH THAT'S SIMPLE YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE MOST OF IT AWAY AND THIS WASN'T APPLOYED TO RECEIVE ANY THE MONEY OURSELVES THIS WAS REALLY ABOUT REDUCING THE IMPACT OF THAT REWARD NOW HOPEFULLY GIVING A MONEY AWAY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH OF IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WAS REWARDING IN AN OF ITSELF BUT IF YOU'RE A STUDENT WHOSE PURSUING GOALS IN UNIVERSITY OR YOU'RE AN ATHLET WHOSE PURSUING GOALS IT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE FROM A RATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THESE MECHANISMS TO HIT A NEW HIGH POINT OF PERFORMANCE OR TO GET THAT A PLASIR FOR YOU IF IT'S AN AMINES ET CETERA AND TO TELL YOURSELF OK THAT WAS GOOD BUT TO ACTUALLY ACTIVELY BLUNT THE REWARD TO NOT GOAL AND CELEBRATE TOO INTENSELY BECAUSE IN DOING THAT YOU KEEP YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN CHECK AND YOU INSURE THAT YOU'RE GING TO STAY ON THE PATH OF CONTINUED PURSUIT NOT JUST FOR THAT THING BUT FOR ALL THINGS BIG INCREASES IN DOPAMINE LEAD TO BIG CRASHES IN DOPAMINE AND BIG INCREASES IN DOPAMINE UP THE ANTI THEY INCREASE THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU ARE WILLING TO ENVEST TIME AND ENERGY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE GOALS AND REWARDS THAT MAY BE OUT OF YOUR REACH YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO SUCCEED SO TO MAKE THIS CRYSTAL CLEAR CELEBRATE YOUR WINDS BUT DON'T CELEBRATE EVERY WIND THAT'S ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN INSURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH OF PROGRESS AND I THINK MOST OF THE LEARNING TOOLS THAT ARE IN SCHOOLS ARE ABOUT REWARD HOPEFULLY FOR FOR GENUINE PERFORMANCE THEY ARE ABOUT ENCOURAGING US WE DO HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PERFORM WELL ONE OF THE HULLMARKS OF GROWTH MINESET IS THE INTERNALIZATION THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING IT RIGHT YET THE WORD YET IS VERY IMPORTANT AND ALSO THE ENSE THAT WE REWARD OUR GOOD OUR GOOD BEHAVIOR ARE OUR GOOD PERFORMANCE BUT NOT EVERY TIME ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE REWARD AND REINFORCEMENT OUT OF YOUR OWN HANDS IN YOUR OWN MIND AND YOU TELL SOMEBODY THAT THEY ARE IN CONTROL OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOUR WINDS NOW THIS IS I REALIZE IS VERY UNNATURAL FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO SIMPLY GOING TO BE IN PURSUIT AND YOUARE GOING TO REALLY REGISTER YOUR WINDS AND YOU THINK THAT THATSCON ACTUALLY MAKE YOU A BETTER PERFORMER IT WILL IN THE SHORT TERM BUT NOT IN THE LONG TERM SO YOU CAN LIFT THE A WHAT LOSS VAGES AND ATLANTIC CITY AND OTHER GAMBOLING A MECHANISMS AND PLACES HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THEY LIFTED IT FROM THE SCIENTISTS YOU CAN NOW TAKE IT BACK AND YOU CAN START TO LEVERAGE THAT AND YOU JUST MAKE IT INTERMITTENT YOU REWARD YOURSELF NOT ON A PREDICTABLE SCHEDUL SO NOT EVERY OTHER TIME OR EVERY THIRD TIME OR EVERY TENTH TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT'S THREE IN A ROW THAN NOT AT ALL FOR TEN DAYS SO REWARD IS IMPORTANT SELF REWARD IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING IT ON SUCH A PREDICTABLE SCHEDUAL THAT YOU BURN OUT THESE STIPAME IN CIRCUITS OR THAT YOU UNDERCUT YOUR OWN ABILITY TO STRIVE AND ACHIEV I SHALL HAVE A STORY FROM GRADUATE SCHOOL WHICH I WAS FORCED INTO AN INTERMIT ANT REINFORCEMENT SCHEDUL THAT AND DO BELIEVE IS SERVED ME VERY WELL IN MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER ANOTHER ASPECTS OF LIFE MY GRADUATE ADVISER WAS AN AMAZING SCIENTISTS UN FORTUNE SHE PASSED AWAY BUT THE MAZING SCIENTISTS AND AMAZING HUMAN BEING WITH A VERY DRY AND AM SOMEWHAT CRUEL SENSE OF HUMOR AND HER NAME WAS BARBER CHAPMAN AND WE PUBLISHED A PAPER IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE AND A SCIENCE NATURE AND SELL ARE CONSIDERED THE BIG THREE THE MOST COMPETITIVE JOURNALS TO PUBLISHAND I HAD A FIRST AUTHOR PAPER IN SCIENCE IT WAS AM REALLY EXCITING TO ME WAS A GRADUATES TO NI WS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE DISCOVERY I WAS EXCITED THAT IT WAS IN SCIENCE I WAS JUST IN A THRILLED AND I REMEMBER WHEN THE PAPER FINALLY GOT ACCEPTED BECAUSE IT INVOLVED A TON OF REVISIONS AND A LOT OF VERY HARD WORK AND SHE CAME IN AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW PAPER GOT EXCEPTED I WAS SUPEREXCITED AND SHE JUST CONE A SAT THERE AND NODDED AND I SAID I REAGIN A CELEBRATE I REAIN I HAVE A PARTY I WT LIKE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO AND I'LL NEVER FORGET HER ANSWER SHE SAID WE SHOULD SKIP THIS ONE AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS JOKING AND I SAID WHAT YOU MEANS SKIP THIS ONE WERE IN NO PUBLISH THE FAPER SO YOUT RECIMPOSE THE PAPER BUT SHE SAID YOU KNOW MAYBE WHEN YOU GET LIKE FOR MORE MAYBE THREE MAYBE TOO AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS MESSING WITH ME AND SHE WAS A MESSING WITH ME AND SHE WAS RIGHT WE NEVER HAD A PARTY WE NEVER HAD A CELEBRATION FOR THAT PAPER I THINK SHE WAS REALLY TRING TO N STILL TWO IDEAS IN ME ONE IS THAT THE WORK ITSELF WAS WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MOST REWARDING THE PRACTICE OF EXPERIMENTATION A WRITING THE PAPER THE EXPERIENCE OF ACHIEVING SOMETHING THO WORKED VERY HARD AT AND THAT DID INDEED FEEL AMAZING ACTION CAN STILL FEEL IT MY BODY NOW THE EXCITEMENTS O THER WAS STILL A DOPAMIN A RELEASE OR THAT ARCHIS IS GOING VERY LONG THIS WOULD BE A ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW THAT THIS HAPPENED  THAT'S REMARKABLE THE OTHER ONE IS THAT SHE'S RIGHT WE NEVER WENT OUT AND CELEBRATED AND WE DID CELEBRATE OTHER WINDS OTHER PAPERS IN THE FUTURE IN THINGS THAT SORT BUT SHE WAS I ITHER CONSCIOUSLY OR OR  SUBCONSCIOUSLY PUTTING ME ON AN INTERMITTENT REWARD SCHEDUAL AND TO THIS DAY WHEN SOMETHING REALLY GOOD HAPPENS I ACTUALLY HESITATE AS TO WHETHER NOT I WANT INTERNALIZE THAT AND CELEBRATE WHETHER I WANT A TELL ANYBODY WHICH IS ITS OWN FORM OF CELEBRATION CAUSE THEN YOU'RE GETTING POSITIVE FEET BACK AND SO I AM VERY CAUTIOUS WITH HOW I DEPLOY DOPAMING RELEASE IN RESPONSE TO WINDS IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY WAY THAT I'VE NAVIGATED MY CAREER A THEIR NUMBER OF OTHER PRINCIPLES I INCORPORATE BUT INTERMITTENT REWARD FOR WINDS FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IS A VERY POWERFUL WAY TO INSURE THAT YOU WILL STAY ON THE PATH OF PURSUIT AT THIS POINT IN THE PODCAST I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS SOME CORRECTIONS I MADE SOME ERRORS IN PREVIOUS EPISODES THEY WEREN'T MAJOR ERRORS BUT A COUPLE OF YOU POINTED THEM OUT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE STRIVE FOR ACCURACY SO THE FIRST ONE WAS I TALKED IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR SOME PEOPLE NOT ALL OF ASHUAGANDA AND ITS ROLL IN BLUNTING CORTESALL AN A WAY OF OFFSETTING MEDIUM TERM AND SOME LONG TERM STRESS IT'S AS A SUPPLEMENT THAT I'VE BENEFITED FROM IT WORKS THROUGH THE GABA SYSTEM AND SOME OTHER SYSTEMS SOME ONE POINTED OUT A STUDY THAT  ADMITTEDLY WAS DONE IN RATS I POINT I WAS FOCUSING MAINLY ON STUDIES IN HUMANS DURING THE EPISODE BUT THEY POINT OUT A A STUDY THAT WAS DONE IN RATS THAT SHOWED THAT LONG TERM ADMINISTRATION OF OF OSCHUAGANDA COULD ACTUALLY CREATE SOME NEGATIVE EFFECTS A MAINLY ON THE FIROID AND A PERHAPS EVEN THE QARTIZAL SYSTEM MAYBE THE MELOTONIAN SYSTEM I JUST ONE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT STUDY A I'LL REFERENCE IT IN THE CAPTION A AGAIN THAT WAS A RAT STUDY I WAS FOCUSED ON HUMAN STUDIES PLEASE GO TO EXAMINED OUT CALM PUTTING OSHUAGANDE WILL TELL YOU THE VERIOUS EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF BRAIN EMBODY IT ALSO LINKED TO THE PUBMET ARTICLES THAT ARE RELEVANT THERE IT IS CALLED THE HUMAN EFFECT MATRICS CAUSE THAT'S ONLY FOCUSSD ON HUMANS THAT'S ONE THE READS I LIKE EXAMINED OT CALM AS ITS FOCUSED ON HUMAN STUDIES GEN A WONDERFUL FREE RESOURCE BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU POINTED OUT THAT STUDY BECAUSE I DO WANT PEOPLE BEAWARE OF THE THE RANGE OF AFFECTS THAT THESE A VARIOUS COMPOUNDS CAN HAVE AS WELL A COUPLE TIMES IN PREVIOUS EPISODES I SAID FIVE H T P AND NOT FIVE H T FIVE H T IS SERATONAN FIVE EH T P IS A PRECURSED IN A SERATONAN I WAS TALKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS THAT CAN STIMULATE THE RELEASE OF SERATONAN A IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE I WAS ACTULLY REFERRING TO IT IN HE CONTECT FOR WHICH I DON'T PERSONALLY LIKE TO TAKE FIVE H T P THAT'S JUST MY OWN BIAS AM FOR REASONS I DESCRIBED IN THAT EPISODE BUT A IF YOU HEARD ME SEE FIVE H T P WHEN I MEANT TO TAKE FIVE H T N IOPOLOGIZE AND THEN LAST I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT AGAIN SOMETHING T I MENTION THE BEGINNING WHICH IS THAT THE HUBRMAN LABPODCASTIS NOW SUBTITLED IN SPANISH EPISODES ONE AN TWO AS WELL AS OURE WELCOME BIDIO ARE IN SPANISH THE OTHER ONES WILL BE SUBTITLED SOON YOU CAN EXPECT THAT WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS SO IF YOU KNOW SPANISH SPEAKING A PEOPLE WHO PREFER TO DIGEST THE INFORMATION IN SPANISH OR THAT YOU AM YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THE SPANISH SUBTITLES YOU NEN TO ACTIVATE THOSE A IN THE CAPTION FEATURE ON OU TUBE UNFORTUNALLY WE DON'T HAVE SPANISH A DUBBING OVER ON IN THE AUDIOPLATFORMS I REALIZE ONCE AGAIN WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL HOPEFULLY YOU NOW KNOW FAR MORE ABOUT THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM REWARD AND MOTIVATION THAN YOU DID AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PODCAST HOPEFUL YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THE OTHER SIDE OF DOPOMINAND REWARD WHICH IS PAIN AND THE BALANCE OF THIS PLEASURE PAIN SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE MOLECULES THAT WE CALL OR THAT WE'RE DESCRIBED IN THE MOLECULE MORE BOOK I SHOULD SAY AS THE HERE AN NOW MOLECULES THINGS LIKE SERATONAN AND THE END OF CANABANOIDS WE TALKED ABOUT A VARIETY OF SUPPLEMENT BASE TOOLES THINGS LIKE VITAMEN BE SIX AND ZINK AS THEY RELATE TO PROLACTIN P E A VERY INTERESTING COMPOUND CAN I'VE NEVER TRIED IT A VERY INTERESTING DEFLY IN USE OUT THERE AL DOPA MCCUNIPURINES TALKED ABOUT CAFINE TALKED ABOUT NICOTINE TALK ABOUT HOW SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF ATERALL CAN BE CREATED PURELY COGNTIVELY WITHOUT ACTUALLY INJESTING ATER ALL SIMPLY BY TELLING PEOPLE THERE INJESTING ATER ALL GIVING THEM CAFINE VERY INTERESTING STUDY A THAT I REFERENCE TO LOBIT EARLIER AND WE TALKED ABOUT SCHEDULING DOPOMINE ADOPTING THE INTERMITTENT REWARD SCHEDULE FOR YOURSELF IN ORDER TO INSURE LONG TERM ENGAGEMENT WITH PURSUITS THAT I HOPE OUR HEALTHY PURSUITS IN ONES THAT SERVE YOU WELL THIS WAS BY NO MEANS AN EXHAUSTIVE COVERAGE OF ALL THINGS DOPOMINE AND MOTIVATION IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE ONLY TIME THAT WERE GIN TO TALK ABOUT DOPOMINE AND MOTIVATION NEXT EPISODE WE'RE GING TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT EMOTIONS FROM YET ANOTHER PURSPECTIVE BUT HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE ENOUGH NOW TO THINK ABOUT IN THE MEAN TIME AND THAT YOU CAN CONSIDER ADOPTING IN YOUR OWN LIFE AND PRACTICES AS ALWAYS I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION IF YOU LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL TO DAY PLEASE PASS IT ALONG ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TEACH IN SCIENCE THAT I THINK IS REALLY WONDERFUL TO ADOPT IN GENERAL IN LIFE IS THIS IDEA OF WATCH ONE DO ONE TEACH ONE THIS IS WHAT WE TELL GRADUATE STUDENTS IN MEDSTUDENTS IND POST OCKS WATCH SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING LEARN IT THEN DO IT APPLY IT SEE IF IT WORKS FOR YOU AND THEN TEACH IT SO IT'S USUALLY NOT WATCH ONE DO ONE TEACH ONE ITS USUALLY WATCH ONE DO TWENTY TEACH AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU A POSSIBLY WANT I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ATTRIBUTION THESE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE GROUNDED IN NEURO SCIENTS FOR WHICH I CAN'T CLAIM ATTRIBUTION I'M JUST PASSING THEM ALONG SO THAT YOU CAN ADOPT THEM IF YOU LIKE AN PASS THEM ALONG IF YOU THINK PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT FROM THEM MANY OF YOU HAVE CONTINUED TO ASK HOW YOU CAN HELP SUPPORT THE HUBERMEN LAB PODCAST IF YOU LIKE WHAT WE'RE OING HERE AND YOU LIKE

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAONE S A SCIENCE SCIENCE FACHES TOS FOR I MAY DRHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING HEADACHES HEADACHES OR SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY WILL SUFFER AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFETIME OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE SUFFER FROM HEADACHES FAR MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS AND FOR MANY PEOPLE HEADACHES CAN BE INCREDIBLY DEBILITATING LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WORK TO SOCIALIZE TO SLEEP TO EXERCISE ESENTIALLY TO LIVE LIFE IN ANY KIND OF NORMAL WACHE AS WILL SOON DISCUSS THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF HEADACHE WE HAVE MY GRAIN HEADACHES TENSION HEADACHES CLUSTER HEADACHES TO DAY WILL REVIOU ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES AND WHAT THE UNDERLINE BIOLOGY OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE TYPES OF HEADACHES IS AS WELL AS FORTUNATELY THE MANY EXCELLENT TREATMENTS THAT EXIST FOR THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHE IN FACT WHAT WILL SOON DISCUSS IS THAT BY UNDERSTANDING WHICH TYPE OF HEADACHE YOU HAVE AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY OF EACH DIFFERENT TYPE OF HEADACHE IT BECOMES QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD TO SELECT THE BEST TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR YOU TO FOR INSTANCE PROVIDE RELIEF FROM FREQUENT AND RECURRING TENSION HEADACHES CLUSTER HEADACHES EVEN SCINESS HEADACHES THE SORTS OF HEADACHES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SCINENCE INFECTIONS IN COLDS WHERE THE SCIENENCES GET CLOGGED UP AND YOU ESPERIENCE HEADACHE SO WILE TO DAY'S EPISODE FOCUSSES ON ALL ASPECTS AND TYPES OF HEADACHES IT WILL HAVE TREMENDOUS RELEVANTS FOR EVERYBODY SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT EXPERIENCE HEADACHE EVERY ONCE AN A WHILE OR ONLY WHEN YOU'RE SICK OR HAVE A SCINES HEADACHE OR FOR THOSE OF YIOU THAT SUFFER FROM DEBILITATING MIGRANS TODAY'S CONVERSATION ACTUALLY HAS A BIT OF OPTIMISM WOVEN INTO IT MEANING THERE ARE EXCELLENT TREATMENTS FOR EACH AN EVERY ONE OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES AND I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED AND EXCITED TO LEARN WHEN RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE THAT THE TREATMENTS FOR HEADACHE RANGE FROM OF COURSE PRESCRIPTION DRUG TREATMENTS AND OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATIONS OF THE SORT OF TYPE THAT MOST OF US HAVE HEARD ABOUT I BEPROPINNASSEE TO MENIPIN AND SO FORTH SO CLED IN IN TI INFLAMATORY DRUGS BUT IT TURNS OUT THEIRE MANY NATURAL TREATMENTS FOR HEADACHE THAT WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AND EVEN SOME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS APPEAR TO BE EASILY AS EFFECTIVE IN A MANY CASES MORE EFFECTIVE THEN THE TYPICAL DRUG TREATMENTS MANY OF WHICH CAN CARRY SIDE IFFECTS THAT IS THE DRUG TREATMENTS CARRY TYTE EFFECTS WHEREAS THE NATURAL TREATMENTS APPEAR TO NOT CARRYSIDE EFFECTS NOWOF COURSE ANY'S AND WE HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT NATURAL TREATMENTS THEREARE LIKELY TO BE SOME IROLES OUT THERE AND PEOPLE THINKING OWE YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE A A BUNCH OF WOO SCIENCE WELL FAR FROM IT AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN TO DAY EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE TREATMENTS FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE DIFFERENT TINDS OF HEADACHES IS GROUNDED IN SOLID BIOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THAT PARTICULAR TREATMENT OUGHT TO WORK AND DOES WORK SO FOR INSTANCE YOU'LL LEARN THAT SOME HEADACHE ARISES BECAUSE A MUSCULAR PAIN OTHER HEADACHE ARISES BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE VAZO DILATION THE ARTERIES AND BLOOD VESSELS GET BIGGER AND WIDER AND SO THERE'S A PRESSURE AND A SWELLING WITHIN THE CRANIUM THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AS A HEADACHE AND IT TURNS OUT THAT MANY OF THE MORE NATURAL TREATMENTS OUT THERE CAN ADDRESS EITHER THE MUSCULAR PAIN ISSUE OR THE VASE OF DILASION ISSUE OR OTHER ISSUES AND UNDERLYING MECHANISMS FOR HEADACHE SO AGAIND WHILE HEADACHES ARE VERY INTRUSIVE IRRITATING AND IN SOME CASES DEBILITATING THERE IS CERTAINLY LIGHT AT THE END OF THIS TUNNEL MEANING BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE EACH IN EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL HAVE AN ARRAY OF EXCELLENT TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM IN ORDER TO ADDRESS AND PROVIDE RELIEF FROM ANY OF THE DFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME ID LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST PONSER IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RASIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHOSITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TELECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I AVE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT HEADACHES AND AS WE ARE SOON GOING TO LEARN THEIRE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES AND DIFFENTYPES OF HEADACHS ARISE FROM CHANGES IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF TISSUES IN THE HEAD AREA AND INDEED IN THE NECK AREA AS WELL NOW ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IF YOU WANT RELIEF FROM A HEADACHE YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHICH TISSUE IS MAINLY INVOLVED IN CREATING THAT TYPE OF HEADACH SO FOR INSTANCE MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM WHAT ARE CALLE TENSION HEADACHES NOW TENSION HEADACHES ARE LEBIT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE MIGHT THINK OUT TENSION I'M UNDER A LOT OF TENSION IND STRESS IN THEREFORE I GET TENSION HEADACHES AND INDEED STRESS CAN CAUSE TENSION HEADACHES BUT TENSION HEADACHES ARE REALY THE SORT OF HEADACHE THAT YOU FEEL AROUND THE TOP PART OF THE HEAD NOT THE VERY TOP BUT SOR OF WHERE YOU WOULD PUT A HEAD BAND SO ABOVE THE EYES AND AROUND THE HEAD IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE HEAD BUT THE MAIN UNDERLYING REASON THAT IS THE TISSUE SYSTEM THAT MAINLY UNDERLIES TENSION HEADACHES IS THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM THERE ARE LO T OF MUSCLES ON THE SKULL BELIEVE IT OR NOT OF COURSE ON THE NECK AND THEY ALLOW YOU TO MOVE YOUR NECK AND HEAD THEIR LOT OF MUSCLES THAT LIE PARALLEL TO THE SKULL AND OFTENTIMES THOSE MUSCLES WILL UNDERGO EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF CONSTRICTION NOW THERE OF COURSE MUSCLES IN THE JAW THAT CAN ALSO LEAD THE HEADACHE AND JAW ACHE AND THINKS OF THAT SORT AND NECK ACHES AND HEADACHES SO WHAT WERE REALLY POINTING OUT HERE IS THAT THE MUSCLES ARE A KEY PLAYER IN THE FORMATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHE TENSION HEADACHE IN PARTICULAR BUT OF COURSE MUSCLES AND MUSCLE TENSION CAN BE EVOLVED IN THE OTHER TYPES OF HEADACHES AS WELL AGENS I JUST WANT A HIGHLIGHT MUSCULAR ISSUES AS ONE PARTICULAR SOURCE OF THE ACHE IN HEADACHES THE OTHER TISSUE THAT CAN BE PROMINENTLY INVOLVED IN GENERATING THE ACHE OF A HEADACHE R THE SO CALLED MININGIES NOW THE MININGIES IN ADDITION TO BEING A FUN WORD TO SAY OR A BUNCH OF TISSUES THAT LINE THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN AND RESIDE BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THE SKULL SO YOU MIGHT THINK IOK A BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THE SKULL ERE'S PY JUST TA LIBIT OF FLUID AND THE BRAIN IS RIGHT UP NEXT TO THE SKULL BUT TURNS OUT THAT SNOT THE CASE THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY INCASED IN A VERY THICK VERY DURABLE SACK OR CASING THAT'S WRAPPED AROUND IT TIGHT LIKE SYRRAND RAP IT ACTUALLY HAS A NAME WHICH IS DURA D R ACH AND SO YOU CAN REMEMBER DURA DURABLE AND ON HAVING DONE SOME SURGERIES MANY SURGERIES BEFORE ON BRAINS OF DIFFERENT TYPES RANGING FROM HUMAN EVEN THOGHI'M NOT A NURROW SURGEON AS A CLINITION RANGING FROM HUMAN TO OTHER TYPES OF A SPECIES WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE DURA IS EXCEEDINGLY DURABLE GETTING THROUGH THIS THING REALLY REQUIRES IN A VERY SHARP RAISOR BLADE SO THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY SITTING IN A VERY FIBROUS LIKE SACK THAT YOU SIMPLY COULD NOT OPEN UP WITH YOUR FINGER TIPS UNDER ANY CONDITIONS IT'S REALLY DURABLE THE MININGIS ARE IN THAT GENERAL AREA AN ALSO IN CASING THE BRAIN AND THE MNINGIS PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL BUFFER BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THE DURA AND THE SKULL SO AGAIN YOU DONT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN IS JUST SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO THE SKULL IT'S CLOSE BY BUT THERE ARE BUNCH OF OTHER THIN FIBROUS TISSUES MANY OF WHICH ARE VERY THIN AND FRAGILE AND OTHERS OF WHICH SUCH AS THE DURA THAT ARE VERY VERY STRONG BECAUSE THEIR VERY FIBROS ALMOST LIKE A A IF YOU'VE EVER FELT THA FOR INSTANCE THE SAL OF A OF A SAL BOAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF IS JUST THIS BIG FLAPPING SHEET IN THE WIND IT IS ANYTHING BUT A SHEET IN THE WIND IT IS A VERY VERY STRONG AND DURABLE MATERIAL NOW THE PROXIMITY OF THE DURA AND THE MANINGIS TO THE BRAIN AND THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING IS RAPPED VERY TIGHTLY TOGETHER AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VASCULATURE THATLBE ARTERIES BLOOD VESSELS IN CAPLERIS ARE ALL IN THAT AREA ON THE TOPP OF THE BRAIN AND THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN THE FACT THAT ALL OF THAT IS IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY IND RAPPED REALLY TIGHT IN THIS VERY DURABLE SACK IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHEN BLOOD VESCLES OR ARTERIES OR BOTH BECOME DILATED THEY OPEN THERE CREATES A PRESSURE BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THOSE TISSUES AND BECAU S THERE ISN'T MUCH DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TISSUES LIKE THE DURA AN THE MANINGIES AND THE SKULL THERE'S ALSO PRESSURE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE BRAIN TO LITERALLY SNEAK UP WHERE I SHOULD SAY IT GIVE THE IMPRESSION THT YOUR BRAIN IS EXPANDING UP AGAINST YOUR SKULL SO THE POINT HERE IS THAT WHILE MUSCULAR TENSION CAN GIVE RISE TO HEADACHE THE OTHER THING THAT CAN GIVE RISE TO HEADACHE IS SO CALLED VAZO DILATION THE EXPANSION OR THE WIDENING OF THE ARTERIES BLOOD VESSELS AND CAPLARIES AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THAT GIVES RISE TO HEADACHE IS BECAUSE THERE'E SIMPLY NOT A LOT OF SPACE FOR THAT EXPANSION TO GO IT DOESN'T ALLOW ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE BRAIN TO PUSH UP AGAINST THAT VERY DURABLE TISSUE AND THAT VERY DURABLE TISSUE TO PUSH UP AGAINST THE SKULL AND EVEN THOUGH THE BRAIN ITSELF DOESN'T HAVE PAIN RECEPTORS THAT'S RIGHT THE BRAIN ITSELF DOES NOT PAIN RECEPTORS THAT IS WHY A NURO SURGEON CAN TAKE OFF A PIECE OF SKULL AND CAN PROBROUND IN THE BRAIN WITH AN ELECTROTE AND THE PERSON IS COMPLETELY UNAWARE AND IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH THE SKULL THAT OF COURSE HIT LITTLE SKIN FLAP HAS TO REMOVE BE REMOVED FROM THE SKULL THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF TOPICAL AND ESTHETACHE BUT REALLY YOU DON'T NEED ANY ANESTHETICHE TO GO INTO THE BRAIN ITSELF BECAUSE THERE AREN'T PAIN RECEPTORS ON THE BRAIN ITSELL HOWEVER THE TISSUE SURROUNDING THE BRAIN SUCH IS THE DURA THE MANINGIES AND THE VASCULATURE THAT THEN REACHES UP BELEED OR NOT INTO THE SKULL THE VASCULISUR DOESN'T ACTUALLY STOP RIGHT BENEATH THE SCULLID ACTUALLY BLOOD VESSELS IT GET INTO THE SKULL AND THEIR ASHI AN PORTALS BY WHICH BLOOD CAN MOVE WITHIN THE SKULL ITSELF BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT SINCE ALL OF THE TISSUES OF VERY CLOSE BY AND VERY COMPACT WITH RESPECT TO ONE ANOTHER ANY INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE PORTALS THAT ALLOW MOVEMENT OF BLOOD THERE AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE WHAT ARE CALLED NO SUSCEPTORS AND NO SEI NOSUCEPTORS THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY PAIN RECEPTORS BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF PAIN RECEPTORS IN THE TISSUES AROUND THE BRAIN WHEN THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THOSE VASCULAR PORTALS THE ARTERIES CAPLARIES AND VESSELS WE EXPERIENCE THAT AS INTENSE PAIN AND PRESSURE AND FORTUNATELY THERE ARE EXCELLENT TREATMENTS FOR DEALING WITH THAT INTENSE PAIN AND PRESSUR BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE INTENSE PAIN AND PRESSURE THAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF VAZO DILATION THAT IS THE WIDENING OF THESE DIFFERENT VASCULAR PORTALS IS VERY DIFFERENT THEN THE TYPE OF PAIN THAT ARISES FROM MUSCULAR TENSION AS IS THE CASE WITH TENSION HEADACHE BECASE SO NOW WE HAVE TWO SOURCES OF PAIN THAT IS THE ACHE IN HEADACHE AND THERE TWO MORE THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IN TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES THAT WILL DE SKUSS AND IN TERMS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHICH ARE GOING TO BE THE BEST TREATMENTS FOR THE DIFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES AND THOSE ARE NURL AND INFLAMATORY RESPONSES SO LIT'S TALK ABOUT THE NURL TYPE FIRST THERE IS A TYPE OF HEADACHE THAT MANY PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY SUFFER FROM WI'LL GET INTO THIS IN BLOUNCH MORE DETAIL IN A MOMENT THOSE ARE CALLED CLUSTER HEADACHES CLUSTER HEADACHES ARE HEADACHES THAT ARISE NOT FROM THE SURFACE PEOPLE DON'T EXPERIENCE THEM TAS KIND OF A TIGHTENING OF THE FOREHEAD AND THE NACK AND THE JALW BUT RATHER IT FEELS AS IF THE HEADACHE IS COMING FROM DEEP WITHIN THE HEAD AND IN PARTICULAR FROM BEHIND THE ORBIT OF ONE OR THE OTHER EYES AND SOMETIMES BOTH EYES FOR THOSE AF VIEU THAT AVE EVER EXPERIENCE CLUSTER HEADACHES THEY ARE EXTREMELY PAINFUL EVEN THE MORE WHERE I SHOULD SAY THE RELATIVELY MORE MINOR CLUSTER HEADACHES ARE EXTREMELY PAINFUL IN THE SEVERE ONES ARE EXCEEDINGLY PAINFUL CLUSTER HEADACHES ARISE FROM DEEP OR THIS WE GET THE SENSATION THAT THEY ARERISING FROM DEEP WITHIN OUR HEAD AS UPPOSE FROM THE SURFACE INWARD BECAUSE THEY ARE NURL IN ORIGIN AND THERE'S A PARTICULAR NERVE PATHWAY CALLED THE TRIGEMINAL NERVE THAT OFTEN IS THE ORIGIN OF THESE CLUSTER HEADACHS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE BEHIND THE EYE THE TRIGEMINAL IS THE NAME SUGGESTS HAS THREE BRANCHES TRY OCASO THERE'S A A BRANCH THAT ESSENTIALLY EXTENDS TO THE EYE THERE'S ALSO A BRANCH THAT EXTENDS TO THE MANDABLE RIGT TO THE A TO THE LIP AND THERE'S A BRANCH THAT EXTENDS MORE OR LESS TO TO THE NASAL AREA AND SO THIS TRIGEMINAL NERVE BECOMES INFLAMED OR IN OTHER WAYS IS HYPER ACTIVATED IN SOME CASES AND THAT CAUSES THE DEEP PAIN BELOW THE EYE BECAUSE IT IS THAT FIRST BRANCH OF THE TRIGEMINAL NERVE WHICH IS THE OPTHALMIC BRANCH WHICH TENDS TO BE ACTIVATED FIRST SO PUPIL START FEELING AS IF THERE'S A PAIN BEHIND THEIR EYE IN PARTICULAR ON ONE SIDE OFTEN TIMES THERE'S LACRAMATION WHICH IS TEERING UP THERE CAN BE SOME NASAL DISCHARGE ANOTHER COMMON SYMPTEM OF THIS TYPE OF HEADACHE THAT IS THE CLUSTER HEADACHE IS THAT THE PUPILS SOMETIMES WILL BECOME VERY SMALL THE PUPILS OF THE EYES AND THEY WON'T DILATE EVEN IN DARKNESS SO THERE R BUNCH OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON ON ONE OR BOTH SIDES OF THE FACE THAT SEEM TO ARISE FROM DEEP WITHIN THE HEAD OR IT'S ALMOST AS IF IT'S COMING FROM THE BRAIN OUTWARD AND THAT'S BECAUSE ITS NURL AND ORIGIN O CASE WE'VE GOT MUSCULAR ORIGINS OF HEADACHES WE'VE GOT MININGIAL ORIGINS OF HEADACHES THAT IS THE THE STUFF AROUND THE BRAIN AND AS IT RELATES TO THE VASCULATURE AND WE HAVE NURL ORIGINS OF HEADACHE AND OF COURSE THERE'S INFLAMMATION ORIGINS OF HEADACHES NOW INFLAMMATION IS A TERM TAT GETS THROWN AROUND A LOT THESE DAYS PEOPLE OR TYNG MOUT YON THIS REDUCES INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATION IS BAD AND AND I I SUPPOSE IN SOME CASES AND WHEN INFLAMMATION AS REALLY WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE BRAIN OR BODY IT'S BAD BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF US SHOULD THINK ABOUT INFLAMMATION PERSAY AS BAT WHAT I MEAN IS INFLAMMATION IS JUST ONE FORM OF SIGNALING IN THE BODY WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES THE BRAIN INFLAMMATION OF A TISSUE IS ONE WAY IN WHICH A SET OF CELLS SO THESE COULD BE OF FOR INSTANCE A CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND WE COVER THIS IN A DETAILED EPISODE ALL ABOUT THE UMION SYSTEM IF YOUD LIKE TO CHECK THAT OUT YOU GO TO HUBERMAN LABDOK CALM JUST PUT INTO OUR SEARCH FUNCTION IMMUNE SYSTEM AND YOU CAN FIND THAT EPISODE BY THE WAY ALL OF OUR EPISODES ARE SEARCHABLE BY KEYWARD AT HUBERMAN LABDOK COMEN ITWLL TAKE YOU TO SPECIFIC EPISODES AND TIME STAMPS FOR THE TOPICS YOURE INTERESTED IN SO FORSAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT HEADACHE INFLAMMATION IS GOING TO BE THE CASE WHEN ONE PARTICULAR TISSUE IN AND AROUND THE HEAD AREA IS RELEASING MOLECULES CITA KINDS WHICH SOMETIMES ARE CALLED FLAMMATORY SIDE O KINES BUT THERE ARE ALSO NON INFLAMMATORY OR ANTI INFLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS BUT INFLAMMATORY MOLECULES THAT ARE SIGNALLING TO THE REST OF THE BODY HEY THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE THERE'S EITHER SOME INTRUSIVE OBJECT AND INDEED IF YOUE WHERE TO GET YOU KNOW A BEEBE OR A SPLINTER INTO A PARTICULAR OF YOU KNOW SKINAREA THERE BE LOT OF INFLAMMATION SO CAN BE THE INTRODUCTION OF A FOREIGN PHYSICAL OBJECT INTO AN AREA THAT WILL CAUSE INFLAMMATION IT CAN BE THE PRESENCE OF SOME SORT OF LOCAL TOXIN IN THAT AREA IT COULD BE A MORE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION NONE THE LESS INFLAMMATION IN THE NECK AND HEAD AREA OR FRANKLY ANYWHERE WITHIN THE SCNESS AREAS IS WHO INCLUDE THE MOUTH THE NOSE AROUND THE EYES BECAUSE THE SCINESSES MANY OF US THINK AF SCINESSES IS JUST OUR NOSE BUT ACTUALLY IF I WERE TO SHOW YOU A SKULL A HUMAN SULL OR ANY OTHER KIND OF SKULL YOU'D BE VERY HOTEFULLY INTRIGUED TO LEARN THAT THE SKULL IS JUST NOT ONE BIG PIECE OF SOLID BONE OR A YOU KNOW A TOP WITH A JAW BELOW IT IT ACTUALLY HAS ALL THESE SMALL WHAT ARE CALLED FENISTRATIONS LITTLE HOLES AND CANALS THAT RUN THROUGH THE SKULL AND THROUGH THE DEPTH OF THE SKULL LIKE LITTLE TUBES OU GOT THEM DOWN HERE ON YOUR MANDABLE YOU'VE GOT THEM ABOVE YOUR LIPS YOU HAVE THEM A ON EITHER SIDES OF YOUR NOSE THOSE OF THE SCINESSES THE SCNESSES ALLOW THE PASSAGE DIFFERENT FLUIDS THROUGH THE SKULL BECAUSE THE SKULL EVEN THOGH IT'S BONE IT'S NOT A DEAD TISSUE RIGHT IN IN A LIVE PERSON OR ANIMAL THE SKULL IS A VERY ACTIVE LIVING TISSUE INDEED ALL BONE IS ACTIVE LIVING TISSUE AND IT NEEDS TO BE NOURISHED WITH BLOOD IT NEEDS TO BE NOURISHED WITH CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID IN THE CASE OF THE SCULL AN EAS TO BE NOURSH WITH ALL SORTS OF IMPORTANT THINGS SO THOSE SCINESSES OFTEN TIMES CAN BECOME CLOGED AS IS IN THE CASE WITH SCINESS HEADACHE WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE BIT BUT MORE GENERALLY ANY TIME THERE'S INFLAMMATION OF ONE GIVEN AREA OF THE BODY SO COULD BE A SHOULDER IT CULD BE THE NECK IT COULD BE THE MOUTH THAT COLD BE THE NOSE HEN THE CASE OF HEADACHE IT COULD BE ANY PORTION OF THE HEAD OR NECK WHAT HAPPENS IS INFLAMMATION WHILE IT'S A VERY EFFICIENT SIGNAL IT'S MUCH LIKE THE SCIREN ON AN AMBULANCE SORA A POLICE CAR AND THAT IT SENDS OUT A VERY BROAD SIGNAL THAT'S VERY CLEAR SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE AND NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH IT'S NOT VERY SPECIFIC SO IT'S VERY ROBUST BUT IT'S NOT VERY SPECIFIC SO FOR INSTANCE IF THERE'S A LITTLE BACTERIAL INFECTION OR A LITTLE VIRAL INFECTION THE INFLAMMATION RESPONSE TO THAT SIDE OF INFECTION TENDS TO BE FAR MORE WIDE SPREAD THEN THE ACTUAL SITE OF INFECTION IT'S A LOBIT DIFFERENT WHEN YOU HAVE A FOREIGN OBJECT THERE LIKE A SPLINTER OR SOME OTHER FOREIGN OBJECT THAT TENDS TO BE A BIT MORE LOCALIZED AND THE UNAN SYSTEM IS ALWAYS TRYING TO LIMIT THE THE EXTENT OF INFLAMMATION BY PUTTING IN DIFFERENT SCAR TISSUES INDEED A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK OF IS KIND OF GROSS PUSSY IN A PUSTULES AND BOILS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I KNOW ITS A GROSS TOPIC ARE WAYS IN WHICH OR BODY TRIES TO RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF INFLAMMATION BUT THE FACE AREA AND THE HEAD ITSELF ARE SO HEAVILY INFUSED WITH BLOOD VESSELS AND THERE'S A CONSTANT PROFUSION AS WE SAY OF BLOOD AND CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID AND OTHER THINGS THROUGH THIS INCREDIBLY METABOL ICALLY ACTIVE TISSUE THAT WE CALL OUR BRAIN AND OUR EYES THOSE ARE BY FAR THE MOST METABOLICALLY ACTIVE TISSUES IN OUR ENTIRE BODY EVEN FOR RUNNING HUNDREDS OF MILES AND ULTRA MARITHONS YOUR BRAIN IS STILL FAR MORE METABOLICALLY DEMANDING THAN ALL THE MUSCLES OF YOUR BODY COMBINE NO MATTER WHAT THE CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF THAT THERE TENDS TO BE A GENERALIZATION ARE A SPREADING OUT OF ANY INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND THAT INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE THEN CAN TRIGGER THE PAIN MECHANISMS ARE WHAT WE EXPERIENCE AS PAIN MECHANISMS IN THE OTHER THREE TYPES OF TISSUES THT WE TALKED ABOUT SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A A SYSTEMIC INFECTION OR YOUR EXPERINCING INFLAMMATION OF ANY KIND AND IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THER ENCROACHES ON THE FACE OR HEAD AREA THAT CAN EASILY AND ALMOST ALWAYS SPILLS OVER INTO ACTIVEATION OF NERVE CELLS CAN GIVE RISE TO NURL BASED HEADACHE OR TO THE MININGIES AND CAN GIVE RISE TO MINNGIL HEADACHES ND OF COURSE TO THE MUSCLES AND TO MUSCULAR TYPE HEADACHES SO WE'VE GOT MUSCULAR ORIGINS OF THE ACHE AND HEADACHE WE HAVE MININGIL ORIGINS OF THE ACHE AND HEADACHE WE HAVE NURL ORIGINS OF THE ACHE AND HEADACHE AND WE HAVE INFLAMMATION BASED ORIGINS OF THE ACHE IN HEADACHE AND THAT PRETAINS TO ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES THAT WERE IN A TALK ABOUT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE THESE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF THE ACHE AND HEADACHE AND THAT SOMETIMES THEY EXIST ALONE AND SOMETIMES EXIST IN COMMINATION HOWEVER A THIS IS AN IMPORTANT HOWEVER ALL PAIN OR I SHOULD SAY ALL EXPERIENCE OF PAIN AS A PERCEPTION IS GOING TO BE NURL IN ORIGIN WHEN WE EXPERIENCE PAIN EWHETHER NOT'S A PIN PRAKE ARE A CUT STUB OUR TOW WE TRIP IN FALL OR A HEADACHE IT IS NURL IN ORIGIN IT IS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVE CELLS THAT ARE GOING TO CARRY  THAT SIGNAL THAT WE PERCEIVE AS PAIN SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF PAIN IN DIFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHE WE E ALSO TALK ABOUT OF COURSE THINK WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN TO DAY'S DISCUSSION THE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS FOR THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHE AND WHY EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS WORK BUT BY UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW PAIN ARISES IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND CERTAINLY BY UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES NOW WHAT IS A TENTION HEADACHE I GAVE YOU SOME IMPRESSION THAT ITS RUNNING AROUND YOUR HEAD LIKE A HEAD BAND IN MANY CASES VERSES CLUSTER HEADACHE WHICH STARTS DEEP BELOW THE EYE OFTEN IF FEELS AS IF IT'S EMERGING FROM DEEP IN THE BRAIN VERSES MIGRAIN WHICH WILL GET INTO IN A MOMENT BY UNDERSTANING THE IFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO QUICKLY PIN POINT WHAT TYPE OF HEADACHE YOU HAVE WHAT TYPES OF TISSUES ARE LIKELY INVOLVED AND THEREFORE WHAT TYPES OF TREATMENTS ARE GOING TO MOST QUICKLY AND MOST COMPLEATELY RELIEVE THAT TYPE OF HEADACHE O CASO FOR THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES AND I PROMISE NO MORE I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN HOW PAIN ARISES AT THE LEVEL OF NERVE CELLS AND SUPPOSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN IF I HAD A HIGHLIGHTER PEN THAT COULD GO OUT ACROSS THE THE MICROPHONES AND SPEAKERS LEADING TO YOUR EARS I WOULD USE IT HERE BECAUSE WHAT AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT IS YOUR BRAIN AND YOU WHICH IS THAT WHILE YOU HAVE TRILLIANS OF NURONSAN WE HEAR THAT YOU AVE TRILLINGS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN AND THE COMING DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES AND DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND SOME MAKE DOPOMINE AND SOME MAKES OUR TONEN AND SO MAKE GLUDOMATAN ON AND ON THE KEY DISTINCTION AMONG DIFFERENT TYPES OF NURONS THAT IS THE THREE TYPES OF NURONS THAT I BELIEVE EVERYBODY SCIENTIST OR NO EVERYBODY SHOULD UNDERSTAND EXIST ARE SOME NURONS NERVE CELLS ARE WHAT WE CALL MOTOR NURONS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY CONTROL THE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLES SOMETIMES FOR WALKING OTHER NURONS CONTROL OF THE MOVEMENTS OF YOUR FINGERS SCIENTISTS CALL THOSE DIDGITS OTHER ONES YOUR TOES THEY ALSO CONTROL THE BEATING OF YOUR HEART ALTHOUGH THAT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MECHANISM AND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TYPE OF TISSUE THEN IS INVOLVED IN GENERATING MOTOR MOVEMENTS OF YOUR LIMBS THESE ARE NURONS THAT WE CALL MOTOR NURONS BECAUSE THEIR GOAL OR THEIR PURPOSE I SHOULD SAY THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEIR THEIR GOAL OR PURPOSE IS BUT WHAT THEY DO IS THEY MAKE SURE THAT MUSCLES CONTRACT SO THAT CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN IN YOUR BODY LIKE YOUR HEART BEATS OR YOU MOVE YOUR LIMBS YOU LIFT YOUR EYELIDS OR YOUR EYEBROWS RATHER AND SO ON AND SO FORTH OTHER TYPES OF NURONS ARE WHAT WE CALL CENSORY NURONS THEY COMMUNICATE THE SAME WAY THAT MOTOR NURONS DO THAT IS THEY FIRE WHAT WE CALL ACTION POTENTIALS WHICH ARE JUST ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THEY RELEASE NOR TRANSMITTERS LIKE ANY OTHER NURON BUT THEY RESPOND TO CERTAIN EVENTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE BODY BUT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS SO WE CALL THESE CENSORY NURONS SOME CENSORY NURONS SENSE LIGHT TOUCH OTHER CENSORY NURONS SENSE FIRM TOUCH OTHER CENSORY NURON SENSE PAIN OTHER CENSORY NURONS SENSE LIGHT BRUSHING ON THE SKIN IN FACT YOU HAVE CENSORY NURONS BELIEVE IT OR NOT  THAT RESPOND SPECIFICALLY TO THE LIGHT BRUSHING OF A HAND ACROSS YOUR SKIN ANY REGION OF YOUR BODY AND IF THAT PARTICULAR REGION OF YOUR BODY HAPPENS TO HAVE HAIR ON IT AND YOU STROKE THE SKIN IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE HAIRS LAY DOWN WE EXPERIENCE THAT AS PLEASURABLE WHEREAS IF YOU STROKE IN THE DIRECTION OPPOSITE TO THE THE WAY THE HAIRS LAY DOWN WE EXPERIENCE THAT AS NOT PLEASURABLE SO THESE CENSORY NURONS RESPON IN SOME CASES FOR INSTANCE WITHIN THE AUDITORY SYSTEM THEY RESPON TO SOUND WAVES IN YOUR EYE THEY RESPOND TO PHOTONS OF LIGHTS SOMETIMES PHOTONS OF LIGHT OF PARTICULAR WAVELINGS THAT WE THINK OF AS RED GREEN BLUE AND SO ON SENSORY NURONS DON'T MOVE MUSCLES THEY RESPOND TO THINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT END THEY EXIST WITHIN US SO WE HAVE CENSORY NURONS THAT SENSE FOR INSTANCE PRESSURE WITHIN OUR HEAD OR PRESSURE WITHIN OURE GOT HOW FULL OR EMPTY OUR GUT IS PAIN WITHIN OUR TISSUES LIKE OUR LIVER OR OR ANY KIND OF OTHER INTERNAL ORGAN SO WEE GOT MOTOR NURON CENSOR NURONS AND THEN THE LAST KIND OF NURON IS WHAT WE CALL MODULATORY NURONS THESE ARE THE ONES THAT ADJUST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CENSORY NRONS IN THE MOTOR NURONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER NOT WE DO ANY THING IN RESPONSE TO A CENSORY IMPT THAT IS WHETHER OR NOT IF THE CENSORY NOR ON FIRES SENDS AT ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL WHEATHER NOT IT WILL GENERATE A MOTOR CHANGE LET ME GIVE YOU A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE THIS SO FOR THOSE OF YOU LISTENING I'LL JUST EXPLAIN WHAT I'M DOING AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WATCHING YOU'LL BE ABLE T SEE I'M HOLDING MY HAND OUT IN FRONT OF ME IF I WERE TO TOUCH THE TOP OF MY HAND WITH MY FINGER TIP I CAN DELIBERATELY OVERRIDE THAT IS I CAN MODULATE THAT MORE TYPICAL REFLECX WHICH IS THAT WHEN SOMETHING TOUCHES US IF WE'RE NOT AWARE OF WHERE IT'S COMING FROM WE TYPICALLY MOVE AWAY FROM THAT THING THAT TOUCHES IS A VERY NATURAL RESPONSE BUT WE CAN DECIDE WHERE NOT CAN A MOVE AWAY WE CAN DECIDE TO STAY STILL OR WE CAN DECIDE TO MOVE TOWARD THE THING THAT TOUCHES US BUT TYPICAL IF YOU WRE TO WALK UP TO SOMEBODY YOUWARE TO TOUCH THEM THEY DEITHER TURN TOWARD YOU ON THE SIDE THAT YOU TOUCH THEM OR THEY'D STEP AWAY IT'S RARE THAT THEY CAN A STEP INTO YOU BUT YOU CAN DECIDE THAT YOU WERE NOCT KIN A MOVE AWAY OR YOU COULD STEP INTO THE DIRECTION OF TOUCH AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE MODULATORY NURONS THAT CAN ADJUST THE CONVERSATION IN A VERY CONTEXT DEPENDENT WAY AS TO WHETHER NOT THE CENSORY NUR ON WILL CAUSE MOTOR NORNS TO CONTRACT OR NOT  SO WE'VE GOT MOTOR NOR ON CENSORY NORONS AND MODULATORY NURONS AND YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING BY NOW WHIRE WE TALKING OF THIS ITHOUHT WERE YOUN TOG ABY HEADACHEI THOUGT RE AN TIE ABOUT TREATMENTS FOR HEADACHEBUT THIS TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU COULD IMAGINE AND IN A MOMENT I'LL EXPLAIN HOW LET'S SAY YOU HAVE TENSION HEADACHES YOUR SOMEBODY THAT HAS THE CLASSIC SYMPTOMS OF TENSION HAD ACH LIMME TEL YOU WAT THOSE ARE THESE ARE HEADACHES AGAIN THAT OCCUR MOR LESS ON THE IN AT KIND OF A HEADBAND LIKE FASHION OR THEY TEND TO START THERE AN IT EXIST AROUND THEHEAD THESE ARE VERY COMMON CAN ARISE FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AM SOURCES RISE FROM SLEEP DEPROVATION THEY CAN RISE FROM EXCESSIVE USE OF CAFFINAN TAKE WILL TALK ABOUT WHY THAT IS THEY CAN ARISE FROM STRESS THEY CAN ARISE FROM VERY LOW LEVEL VIRAL INFECTIONS OR MACTERIAL INFECTIONS BUT WE XPIRINCIES AS JUST AS HEADACHES OR YOU'VE BEEN THINKING TOO HARD OR WORKING TOO HARD OR LIFE HAS BEEN STRESTFUL THEYARE OFTEN ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH JAW PAIN AND JAW TIGHTNESS AND NECK TIGHTNES SO TENSION HEADACHE EVERYTHING YOU'D IMAGIN MUSCULAR TENSION COULD CAUSE WET IF YOU WANT TO TREAT TENSION HEADACHE YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT BECAUSE ALL HEADACHE IS NORAL THAT YOU'D WANT TO GO AFTER SOME SORT OF NURL MECHANISM TO TREAT THEM BUT OF COURSE WE NOW KNOW THAT THEI'RE THREE TYPES OF NURONS THEIRE MOTOR NOR ONS CENSORY NURONS AND MODULATORY NURONS SO WE HAVE CHOICES WE CAN SAY O KADE DO WE WANT TO TURN OFF THE MUSCLES IN THE HEAD JAW AND NECK THAT ARE HIPER CONTRACTIT FOR INSTANCE YOU WANT T TAKE A MUSCLE RELAXOR OR RELAXTENT OR WOULD YOU WANT TO TRYING CHANGE THE CENSORY AND PUT ITSELF MAYBE DON'T CHANGE THE WAY THE MUSCLES ARE BEHAVING BUT SHUT OFF THE CENSORY PART OF IT YOUR ABILITY TO CENSE IT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYSE YOU CAN DO THAT OR WOULD YOU WANT TO ADJUST THE MODULATORY NURONS WOULD YOU WANT TO MAKE IT SOUCH THAT YOU HAVE THE HEADACHE BUT YOU DON'T PERCEIVE THE HEADACHE THAT IS YOU CUT OFF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CENSOR AND THE MOTOR SO THAT THE MUSCLES RELAX TRNSOUPT THER ARE TREATMENTS AND APPROACHES FOR EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAS A DIFFERENT ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES BUT AS YOU CAN QUICKLY SEE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFRENT TYPES OF HEADACHES AND DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO TREATING HEADACHE BUT IF YOU KEEP IN THE BACK YOUR MIND THAT YOU HAVE NURONS THAT CONTRACT MUSCLES TO CREATE MOVEMENT OR TENSION OF MUSCLES MEMORY YOU CAN TURN OFF THOSE NURONS AND ALLOW THOSE MUSCLES TO RELAX YOU CENSORY NURONS THAT SENSE IMPUT AND ASSHE SENSE THE PAIN AND YOU MODULATORY NURONS WHICH CAN ALLOW YOU TO A JUST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CENSERY NURONS AND THE MOTOR NONS AND OF COURSE SOME OF YOUR PROBABLY SCREAMING AT ME BY NOW SAYING WAIT WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT TO DEAL WITH THE MOTOR NERONS OR OR THE MODLITORY NARNS WHINCH YOU WANTED TIS GO STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE AND JUST CUT OFF THE PAIN AH WELL THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT MANY PAIN KILLERS HAVE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL IN PARTICULAR THEY CAN BE SEDATIVE MANY OF THEM CAN BE HABIT FORMING OR EVEN ADDICTIVE AND FOR MANY PEOPLE NOT ALL BUT MANY PEOPLE THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE DRUGS WHETHER NOT THEYRE OVER THE COUNT OR A PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR EVEN MORE NATURAL SUPPLEMENT BASE TYPE TREATMENTS AND THEY WOULD RATHER USE FOR INSTANCE A BEHAVORALE APPROACH IN WHICH THEY CAN MODULATE THEY CAN DELIBERATELY TURN OFF THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CENSORY NURONS AND MOTOR NRONS AND TURNS OUT THOSE APPROACHES EXIST THIS WELL O KE SO AT THIS POINT I PROMISE YOU THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY MORE OF A BIOLOGY LESSON IN TERMS OF APPAINSENSING AND HEADACHES AS A MOR A CONCEPTIOAL PHENOMENON IN STEID WOATD I'D LIKE TO DO NEXT IS TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHES AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND NOT OFTEN DISCUSS EXCEPT FOR THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT UNFORTUNATELY SUFFER REPEATEDLY FROM CERTAIN KINDS OF HEADACHES LIKE MY GRAIN OR CLUSTER OR TENSION HEADACHE BUT THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO EXPERIENCE HEADACHEAND AGAIN THAT IS EVERYBODY AT SOME POINT EXPERIENC THIS HEADACHE RATHER THAN JUST THINK OF HEADACHE AS ONE THING UNDERSTANDING THE MAJOR TYPES OF HEADACHE AND HOW THEY DIFFER FROM AND ARE SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER WELL REALLY HELP YOU IDENTIFY WHAT THE BEST SOURCE OF TREATMENTS FOR THOSE ARE SO I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE DFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHE ARE NOW THE FIRST TYPE OF HEADACH WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS IS THE TENSION TYPE HEADACHE AGAIN TENSION TYPE HEADACHES TEND TO START OFF NOT ALWAYS BUT TEND TO START OFF AS MORE LESS A HALO OR HEADBAND AROUND THE FOREHEAD IN THE AREA ABOVE THE EYES OFTEN ALSO INCLUDE THE JAW THE NECK MUSCLES AND CAN EXTEND EVEN INTO THE UPPER BACK AGAIN THIS CAN BE CAUSED BY SOME LOW LEVEL OF INFECTION BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT TENSION TYPE HEADACHES ARE GONTO COME ON BECAUSE OF SOME CHRONIC PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS USUALLY COMBINE WITH LACK OF SLEEP USUALLY COMBINED WITH LIFE STYLE ISSUES AND OF COURSE WITHOUT GETTING INTO A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT AT ANY TIME YOU HAVE LACK OF SLEEP YOUR CAN HAVE EXCESSIVE STRESS ANY TIME YOU HAVE EXCESSIVE STRESS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOURE OFFSETTING THAT BY GETTING PROPER SLEEP MOST PEOPLE DON'T WHEN THEYRE UNDER EXCESSIVE STRUSS BY THE WAY WE HAVE EXCELLENT TOOLS HER GROUNDED IN EXCELLENT SCIENCE AVAILABLE TO YOU AT ZERO COST IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCED CHRONIC STRESS R IN SHORT TERMSTRESS WE HAVE A MASTER STRESS EPISODE TO HUBRAN LAPODCAS AGAIN JUST GO TO HUBERM IN LAM NOT COMMON ALL THAT TIME STAMPED FOR YOU TENSION TYPE HEADACHES BEGIN IN A MOR LESS A HEAD BAND PATTERN BUT CAN REALLY EXTEND TO OTHER TISSUES AS WELL NOT SO OFTEN IN THE FACE BUT REALLY THE HEAD AND AND OFTEN WILL START TO CLIMB UP TOWARD THE TOP O THE HEAD THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS IN THIS HALO PATTERN SOMETIMES THEY CAN BE LOCALIZE TO ONE AREA SUCH AS THE ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD OR THE FRONT OF THE HEAD OR ONE SIDE OF THE HEAD MORE THAN OTHERS AND THAT'S OFTEN THE CASE BECAUSE OF TENSION WITHIN MUSCLES OF THE NECK THAT TEN TO BIAS THE ACHE TOWARDS ONE SIDE OF THE HEAD I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VEBEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE EASN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BEN THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WIT THE BRAIN THE MUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBATICS ANATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLTIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE GRIPE IF YOU LIKE TO TRYATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TWO AGAIND THAT'S ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY A VITEMIND THREE K TO THE OTHER TYPE OF HEADACHE THAT UNFORTUNAELY AS VERY COMMON IS MIGRAIN HEADACHS MIGRAIN HEADACHES ARE DEFINE GENERALLY AS DISORDERS OF RECURRING ATTACKS OF HEADACHES SO PEOPLE GET MIGRAINS OFTEN GET THEM IN A RECURRING FASHION SOME PEOPLE GET THEM VERY OFTEN OTHER PEOPLE GET THEM LESS OFTEN BUT MIGRAINS ARE VERY DEBILITATING THE NUMBERS THAT IS THE PREVALENCE OF MIGRAIN IS STILL PRETTY DEBATED ONE THING THAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT FEMALES SUFFER FROM MIGRAIN HEADACHES AT A RAKE AT LEAST THREEFOLD HIER THEN DO MALES AND SURPRISINGLY THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY DIRECT HORMONAL ORIGIN BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO GO AND TALK ABOUT HORMONAL HEADACHES THAT IS HEADACHES THAT RELATE TO A DIP IN ESTROGEN AN PROGESTRONE AN PARTICULAR PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE HATAS THE OBULATORY CYCLE SO THERE'S A BIT OF A MYSTERY HERE AND THE MYSTERY IS WHY IS IT THAT MIGRAIN HEADACHES OCCUR AT SUCH GREATER FREQUENCY IN FEMALES EVEN INDEPENDENTLY OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLESO WHEN YOU CONTROL FOR CHANGES AND HORMONES THAT STILL APPEARS TO BE THE CASE AND OVER ALL MIGRAINS ARE VERY COMMON NOW THE NUMBERS ON MIGRAIN AND JUST HOW COMMON MIGRAIN IS ARE EXTREMELY WYDE THIS WAS A  BUT FROSTRATING FOR ME IN RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE YOU WILL FIND FOR INSTANCE THAT SEVENTEEN PER CENT OF WOMEN SUFFER FROM MIGRAES YOU WILL ALSO HEAR THAT SIX PER CENT OF MALES SUFFER FROM MIGRANES YOU WILL ALSO HERE THAT FORTY THREE FORTY THREE PER CENT OF FEMALES SUFFER FROM MIGRAN THAT IS RECURRING HEADACHES THAT QUALIFIES MIGRAN HEADACHES AND THAT SEVENTEEN PER CENT OF MEN SUFFER FROM MIGRANE HEADACHES AN A RECURRING BASIS WHICH IS AGAIN THE DEFINITION OF A MIGRANE HEADACHE OR ONE OF THE KEY DEFINITIONS SO ALL WE CAN SAY FOR SURE IS THAT MANY MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE MAYBE EVEN BILLIONS OF PEOPLE SUFFER FROM MIGRANE HEADACHES THIS CIND OF A STAGGERING A THING TO CONTEMPLATE BUT WE KNOW IT'S EXTREMELY COMMON AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S MORE PREVALENT IN FEMALES IN ANY OF THE STUDIES THAT YOU WILL FIND IN TERMS OF THAT COMPARE THE OVER ALL PREVALENCE OF HEADACHE IT'S GOING TO BE HIGER SUBSTANTIALLY HIGER AND FEMALES IND MALES DOES NOT SEEM TO BE RELATED TO THE OVIITORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING FACTS RELATED TO THAT THAT I'LL JUST YOU TOUCH ON FOR A MOMENT PREGNANCY FOR WHATEVER REASON SEEMS TO BE PROTECTIVE AGAINST MIGRAN HEADACHES THAT IS WOMEN WHO SUFFER FROM RECURRING MIGRAINS BEFORE THEY GET PREGNANT WHEN THEY GET PREGNANT AND OFTEN AFTER THEY GIVE BIRTH THEY EXPERIENCE FEWER MIGRANE HEADACHES SO THERE MAY BE SOMETHING HORMONAL IT MAY BE SOMETHING ELSE WHAT A WE KNOW FOR SURE WE KNOW THAT HEADACHE THAT IS THE ACHE IN HEADACHE IS NURL SO WHETHER OR NOT THE ORIGINS ARE HORMONAL OR WHETHEROR NOT THE ORIGINS ARE INFLAMMATION OR GOT MICROBIOM OR SOME OTHER FEATURE OF THE BODYBRAINE AXIS AT THIS POINT ALL WE KNOW IS THAT NURL PAIN OR THE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN AT THE NURL LEVEL IS THE FINAL COMMON PATHWAY AND ITS MORE PREVALENT IN FEMALES SO AS I MENTION MIGRANES TEND TO BE RECURRING SO SOME PEOPLE GET THEM ONCE A WEEK SOME PEOPLE GET THEM ONCE A MONTH SOME PEOPLE GET THEM FAR MORE FREQUENTLY THAT THEY CAN BE EXTREMELY DEBILITATING OFTENTIMES PEOPLE EXPERIENCE MIGRANE BECAUSE IT IS A RECURRING PHENOMENON WILL KNOW WHEN A MIGRANE IS COMING ON THEY'LL SAY MY MIGRANE IS COMING ON THE CONSENSEIT COMING THERE'S THIS NOTION OF ORA AND WILL TALK ABOUT ORA IN A INL BIT SOME PEOPLE THING OF ORIGJUST AS VISUAL ORA OR THE SENSE OF KIND OF A HALOING OF LIGHT WITH HE SENSE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE BODY THE ACTUAL DEFINITION OF ORA IS THAT IT'S THE EXPERIENCE THAT SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN ITS THIS KIND OF FEELING OF ANTICIPATION IT'S NOT DEGAVOU DE GAVOU IS DIFFERENT AND VERY INTERESTING IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT DIFFERENT IT'STHIS FEELING THAT SOMETHING'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN AND THE FACT THAT ORA SUCH A PROMINENT FEATURE OF MIGRANE HEADACHES OR AT LEAST THAT PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE HEADACHE IS COMING ON LONG BEFORE THEY FEEL THE ACTUAL ACHE OF THE HEADACHE AND THE OTHER DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS SUGGESTS THAT MIGRANE HAS SOMETHING OF DEEP NURL ORIGIN THAT IT ARISES FROM DEEP WITHIN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SPINAL CORDIAN BRAIN AND THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING LIKE A TENSION HEADACHE THAT IS GOING FROM OUTSIDE IN YOU KOW THE CONSTRICTION OF THE MUSCLES IN THE JAWAN HEADSSO MIGRAN HEADACHES ARE VERY D IFFERENT THAN TENTION HEADACHES EVEN IN TERMS OF HOW THEY COME ON OR THEIR ONSET THE OTHER FEATURE OF MIGRAN HEADACHES THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT DILATION OF THE VESSELS REMEMBER THE VAZO DILATION SO THE WIDENING OF THOSE PIPES THAT WE CALL ARTERIES VESSELS AND CAPLARIES IS A VERY PROMINENT FEATURE OF MIGRAN AND FORTUNATELY THAT ALLOWS FOR VERY PARTICULAR TYPES OF TREATMENT AND WAYS OF DEALING WITH THE SPAIN SPECIFIC TO MIGRAN HEADACHES THE OTHER FEATURE THAT'S COMMON AN MIGRANE HEADACHS IS SO CALLED PHOTOPHOBIA MANY OF YOU OF PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH PHOTOPHOBA O'VE EVER BEEN SLEEP DEPRIVED SIMPLY IF YOU'RE SLEEP DEPRIVED AND YOU GO OUTSIDE IN THE MORNING THE LIGHT IS GOING TO SEEM VERY VERY BRIGHT MUCH BRIGHTER THAN WERE YOU TOVE HAD A REALLY GOOD NIGHT SLEEP AND THAT'S BECAUSE JURING SLEEP THEREARE ALL SORTS OF RESET MECHANISMS IN THE BRAIN THERE'S THE WASHING OUT OF METOBOLIC DEBRIS IN THINGS IN THE BRAIN THE SOLL CALL CL EMPHOTIC WASH OUT THAT'S ESSENTIAL THERE'S ALSO AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE NURAL TISSUE OF THE EYES WHICH S MANY IV YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY BEFORE R ACTUALLY TWO PIECES OF BRAIN THAT IT NEXTRUDED FROM THE CRANIA VAULTSO YOUR EYES YES INDEED ARE TWO PIECES OF BRAIN THE ONLY TO PIECES OF BRAIN OUTSIDE THE CRANIAL BOULTH AND WITHIN YOUR EYES YOU HAVE NURONS AND MECHANISMS THAT A JUST THE THE SORT OF SENSITIVITY OF YOUR EYES TO LIGHT AND OF YOUR BRAIN TO LIGHT AND WHEN YOU ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED OR WHEN YOU HVE A LO LEVEL VIRAL INFECTION OR A COLD OR A FLUE O ANY KIND YOU TEND TO EXPERIENCE LIGHT IS BRIGHTER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS WHEN YOU'RE RESTED OR YOU'RE IN THE HEALTHY STATE SO PHOTOPHOBIAS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY COMMON IN MIGRANE AND OFTEN THEPHOTOPHOBIA IS A PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT A MIGRNE IS COMING ON PEOPLE STRART SAINT HINO IT'S JUST TOO BRIGHT IN HERE AND NORMALLY THEY'D BE ABLE TO TOLERATE THAT LEVEL OF SUNLIGHT OR OF ENDORE A LIGHTING WITH NO PROBLEM SO THEIR TWO ASPECTS OF MIGRANE THAT I THINK ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FOR SAKE OF OF THE TREATMENT AND THAT'S THE DILATION OF VESSEL SO WE IF WE WANT TO TREAT MIGRANE WERE CAN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT CAN CONSTRICT BLOOD VESSELS IN THE BRAIN ARIA BUT WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT PHOTOPHOBIAND NOT PHOTOPHOBIA JUST AS A SYMPTOM OF MIGRANE BUT THAT MAYBE BY ADJUSTING OUR SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT WE CAN ACTUALLY SHORT CIRCUIT SOME OF THE ONSET AND SUBSEQUENT PATHOLOGY OF THE MIGRANE THAT IS IF WE CAN PREVENT PHOTOPHOBIA PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY CAN ACTUALLY OFFSET A LOT OF THE ACHE OF THE MIGRANE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR SO THT'S AN EXCITING AVENUE OF FOR ADDRESSING THE MIGRAN HEADACHES WELL GET IN TO PHOTOPHOBIAN HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT OROLOBIT MORE IN A FEW MINUTES BUT FOR THE TIME BEING WE'VE TALKH ABOUT TENSION HEADACHES WE NOWT TALK ABOUT MIGRAN HEADACHES AGAIN KEEP IN MIND KNOWING WHAT KIND OF HEADACHE YOU HAVE IS ESENSIAL IT'S I WOULD TAKE INDISPENSABLE FOR SELECTING THE BEST TREATMENT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WE'LL SIMPLY GET A HEADACHE AND DECIDE OH I'M AN A POPA COUPLE OF ASPERANE AT WHAT IS ASPER DO ANT ASPERANS AN NANTINE FLAMATORY IT ALSO HAS PRONOUNCED EFFECTS ON THE VAZO DILATION INVAS OF CONSTRICTION SYSTEM IT ACTUALLY ALL WS MORE BLOOD TO FLOW THROUGH THOSE ARTERIES VESSELS IN CAPLERS LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE BABY ASPRIN OR SMALL AMOUNTS OF ASPRAN AS A WAY TO OFFSET CARTIVASCULAR DISEASE TAT'S ANOTHER DISCUSSION BUT WHAT WE KNOW WE KNW THAT IN MY GRAIN THERE'S A HYPERDILACTION OF THE BLOOD VESSELS A HYPERDILATION OF THE VERY LITTLE PORTALS THAT EXIST IN THE BRAIN AND AROUND THE BRAIN AND THAT ARE GOING TO CAUSE THE PAIN TE CAN ACTIV ATE THOSE CENSORY NOR ONS THOSE NOSICEPTORS THAT WILL THEN GIVE US THE EXPERIENCE OF EXTREME HEADACHE IND MYGRAIN SO TAKING AN ASPRINE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT FOR MY GRAIN IN SOME CASES THE WORSE POSSIBLE CHOICE AGAINS O KNOWING WHAT KIND OF HEADACHE YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IS GOING TO BE ESCENTIAL HERE THE OTHER THING THAT OU'LL SOMETIMES HERE IS THAT DRINKING A CUP OF COFFEE OR GETTING CAFFINE THROUGH TEA IS A GREAT WAY TO DEAL WITH HEADACHE WHY WOULD THAT BE WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT COFFEE CAN CAUSE EITHER VASO CONSTRICTION OR VASO DILATION DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU TAKE IT AND WILL GET INTO THE USE OF CAFFIN AS A TREATMENT FOR HEDACHE BECAUSE INDEED IT CAN BE A VERY POTENT TREATMENT FOR HEADACHE BUT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF HEADACHE YOU ARE EXPERIENCING BECAUSE IN SOME CASES DRINKING CAFFIN WHETHER IT'S IN TEA OR COFFEE CAN ABSOLUTELY ALLEVIATE THE PAIN OF A HEADACHE ESPECIALLY IF YOU CATCH THAT ONSET OF A MY GRAIN OR ATTENTION TYPE HEADACHE EARLY ON BUT IN SOME CASES IT CAN MAKE IT FAR FAR WORSE AGAN KNOWING WHICH TYPE OF HEADACHEYOUR EXPERIENCING AND HOW THE DIFFEREN TREATMENTS WORK IS KEE O CASE TOA WE HAVE TENTION TYPE EADACHES MYGRANE TYPE HEADACHES THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THE PICTURE THEY E DIFFERENT UNDERLYING BIOLOGIES THE NEXT TYPE OF HEADACHE IS CLUSTER HEADACHES CLUSTER HEADACHES ARE THE ONES I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT ARISE FROM DEEP WITHIN THE HEAD THEY FEEL AS IF THEY'RE COMING FROM THE INSIDE OUT AND THEY TEND TO BE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WHAT SCIENTISTS AND CLINITIONS CALL UNILATERAL IN TENDS TO ORIGINATE BEHIND THE EYE AND SOMETIMES THE NOSE REGION SOMETIMES IN THE MOUTH REGION AS WELL FEELS KIND OF PATCHY BUT ITS OF IT'S COMING FROM THE INSIDE OUT AND AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE OF THAT TRYGEMINAL NERVE FOR THOSE YOU AM LISTENING AND NOT WATCHING THIS ON YOU TO I'VE GOT THREE FINGERS AS IF IM PUTTING UP THROUGE FINGERS IN HM I'VE GOT ONE POINTED TOWARD MY EYE ONE POINTED TOWARDS MY NOSE REGION AND ONE U TOWARDS MY UPPER LIP THE TRYGEMINAL NERVE IS AN EASY ONE TO REMEMBER AND IT WILL COMPLETELY EXPLAIN A CLUSTER HEADACHES IND WHAT TO DO ABOUT CLUSTER EADACHES IN MONA IF YOU REMEMBER THAT THE HERPYESE ONE  VIRUS AND NOT HERPYES DO NOT GENITAL HERPIES BUT HERPY'S ONE VIRUS IS TE ONE THAT GIVES COLD SORES ON THE MOUTH HERPY'S ONE VIRUS BY THE WAY IS EXCEEDINGLY COMMON UP TO NINETY PER CENT OF PEOPLE MANY CHILDREN IN FACT HAVE THESE AGAIN THIS IS NOT A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED HERPYS ALL THUGH IT CAN BE OF COURSE TRANSMITTED THROUGH KISSING AND SEXTUAL CONTACT BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ORIGIN OF IT O KACH CAN BE PASSED BY SKIN CONTACT IN MUCOSIL CONTACT A SO MUCOSO MUCOSIL SO THI'LL BE KISSING MUCOSILYING OR EVEN SKIN TO MUCOSA LININGS THAT'S WHY IT'S SO COMMON AND THE REASON WHY COLD SORES DEVELOP ON THE MOUTH FOR PEOPLE THAT AF HERPY'S ONE IS BECAUSE THE VIRIS ACTUALLY LIVES ON THE TRYGEMINAL NERVE AND YES IT IS TRUE THAT SOMETIMES THE VIRUS WILL  INFLAME THE NERVE AND THE INFLAMMATION WILL CURR AT THE LEVEL OF THE EYES SO YOU'LL DO ON FORCINGS ON AS GET HERPIES OF TE EYET ACTUALLY CAN BE QUITE DANGEROUS IF YOU HAVE AN INFECTION OF THE EYE HERPIES INFECTION THE E YOU SHOULD SEE NOT PHEMOLOGIST OR THE NOSE REGION THEY CAN EXPERIENCE PAIN IN THE MUCLOSAL TISSUE OF THE NOSE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE MOST INFLAMMATION IS OCCURRING ON THE THE BRANCH THAT INERVATES THE LIP OER THE REGION CLOSE TO THE LEP AND THAT'S WHY A COLD SORT DEVELOPS THERE AND IMMUNE RESPONSE THERE SIGNALLING THA THERE'S INFLAMMATION DUE TO THE HERPIES  VIRUS WHICH LIVES ON THAT NAR ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME NURONS DON'T TURN OVER IN A THE LIFE SPANS WE CAN LIVE ON THERE FOR THE EXTENTIVE OF THE PERSON'S LIFE HOWEVER MOST PEOPLE HOPEFULLY TREAT THERE ACH AS TO BE ONE BUT IF THEY DON'T AT THE THE SORT OF A FREQUENCY AND THE SEVERITY OF INFECTIONS TENDS TO TAPER OFF WITH TIME WILL HAVE AN ENTIRE DISCUSSION ABOUT VIRUSES AND HERPIES IN PARTICULAR IN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT THE THING TO KEEP IN MINE HERE IS THAT THIS VERY NERVE IS THE ONE THAT GETS INFLAME IN THESE CLUSTER TYPE HEADACHES NOW CLUSTERTYPE HEADACHES ARE ASSOCIATE WITH A BUNCH OF VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SYMPTOMS AGAIN THEY TEN TO BE UNALATERAL THEY TEND TED  BEGIN VERY DEEP AND THEY TEND TO BE EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL THEY CAN LAST ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY MINUTES TO THREE HOURS SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THESE IN SLEEP IN FACT THIS IS ONE OF THE CASES WHERE MEN EXPERIENCE HEADACHE MORE THAN FEMALES MEN EXPERIENCES CLUSTER TYPE HEADACHES THAT HAVE A SUDDEN ONSET DURING SLEEP AT FIVE TIMES THE FREQUENCY THEN DO FEMALES THE ORIGIONS OF THAT AREN'T EXACTLY CLEAR THEY DO SEEM TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE VIOLOGICAL CLOCK MECHANISMS THAT SO CL CIRCADIAN MECHANISMS SO IF YOU ARE A MAN OR WOMAN FOR THAT MATTER AND YOUR WAKING UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT WITH A UNALATERAL HEADACHE N IT SEEMS LIKE ITS DEEP WITHIN YOUR A WITHIN YOUR HEAD ORE ITS STARTING THERE AND ITS ON ONE SIDE AND LOCALIZE TO THE EYE AND MAY BE THESE OTHER REGIONS THE TRIGEMINAL IS INVOLVED IN YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM CLUSTER TYPE HEADACH AND YOU SHOULD TALK TO YOUR PHYSICION THE OTHER SYMPTOM THAT'S QUITE COMMON IN CLUSTER TYPE HEADACHE IS A DROUPI EYELID WHICH SHOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THE TRIGEMINAL INTERVATES THE IYREGION AND THEIRE OTHER NERVES THET CONTROL THE EYLID BUT THERE IN THAT GENERAL REGION AND THEY CAN BE IMPACTED THE OTHER THING IS ON THE CALL MEOSIS WHICH IS THAT YOU CAN'T DILATE THE PUPIL I MENTION THIS BEFORCE OF THIS YOUR PUPILS MIGHT GET REALLY REALLY SMALL AND THEY WON'T DILATE AND THE OTHERTHING IS LACIRMATION TEERING AND THEN NAZAL DISCHARGE ALL BECAUSE OF A NURAL INFLAMMATION PROBLEM WHY DO I TELL YOU WITH SUCH DETAIL ABOUT CLUSTER HEADACHES WELL IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY THAT'S EXPERIENCING THE KIND OF PAIN THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH CLUSTER HEADACHE TAKING A STANDARD ANTI AN FLAMATORY OR DOING SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO ADJUST THE VIOLE THE EXCUSE ME THE DILATION OR CONSTRICTION OF BLOOD VESSELS MAY HAVE AN INDIRECT IMPACT ON CLUSTER HEADACHE BUT IS UNLIKELY TO RELIEVE CLUSTER HEADACHE EITHER ACUTELY MEANING RIGHT AWAY OR IN PREVENTING CLUSTER HEADACHES YOU HAVE TO DEAL WIT THIS AS A NURAL ISSUE AND WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF INFLAMMATION AN ACTIVATION OF THESE CLUSTER TYPE HEADACHES AT THE LEVEL OF THE TRIGEMINAL NERVE IN A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE FORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT TREAT ENS THE NEXT TYPE OF HEADACHE THAT IS QUITE COMMON ARE HORMONAL HEADACHES NOW THE PHRASE HORMONAL HEADACHE HOULD ALREADY CUW YOU TO THE FACT THAT IT'S FAR TOO GENERAL A TERM BECAUSE THEREE SO MANY DIFFERENT HORMONES TUSTOSTERON ESTROGEN THIRODHRMAN GROWTHORMON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND THEY ALL HAVE MANY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY EVERY SINGLE HORMONE AND IN PARTICULAR THAT SO CALLED STEROID HORMONES STEROIDS AGAIN NOT JUST LIMITED TOO I THINGS THAT PEOPLE TAKE FOR SPORTS IN FACT THE STEROID HORMONES REFERS TO ESTROGEN TESTOSTERO OF THE SORT THAT WE ALL MAKE THAT MEN AND WOMEN MAKE NATURALLY AND THOSE STEROID HORMONES CAN IMPACGENE EXPRESSION THEY CAN ARE OF COURSE WHAT TURNS ON THE GROWTH OF THE OF THE BREAST TISSUE OF THE TESTICULAR TISSUE OF ON HAIR GROWTH AND AND ON AND ON AND THAT'S ALL BECAUSE OF GENE EXPRESSION IF YOU'RE REALLY CAN A CHANGE THE IDENTITY AND FUNCTION OF A CELL LONG TERM RI YOUR CAN LITERALLY CHANGE THE BREAST TISSUE OR CHANGE THE PENYLE TISSUE OR CHANGE THE OVARIAN TISSUE IN SOME SORT OF CONSISTENT WAY ACROSS THE LISPIN YOU CAN BET THAT THEI RE CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION AND THOSE CHANGES AN GENE EXPRESSION OCCUR BECAUSE THESE STEROID HORMONES HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY SO LIKE THE EX MEN OF HORMONES TO PASS THROUGH THE OUTER MEMBRANE OF A CELL WHICH YOU ALL THE EXRCELLAR MEMBRANE AND INTO THE SO CALE NEWCLEAR MEMBRANE THAT CAN GO INTO THE AREA WHERE GENES ARE MADE AND TORMON AND OFF DIFFERENT GENES HOWEVER THEY MOLTI TASK IN THEIR LIFE THAT IS THESE STEROID HORMONES LIKE ESTROGEN IN PARTICULAR AND TESTOSTRON IN PARTICULAR CAN ALSO BIND TO THE SURFACE OF CELLS AND IMPACT ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT THE LEVEL OF THE CELLS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO A CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION AND THAT SECOND MECHANISM BINDING TO THE SURFACE OF CELLS IS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ESTROGEN CAN CONTROL DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HEADACHE NOW THAT DOESN'T THE SURLYMAN ESTROGEN GIVES YOU HEADACHES IN FACT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE IT TURNS OUT THAT LOW ESTROGEN AND ANOTHER HORMONE LOW PROGESTERONE COMBINE TO GIVE RISE TO HEADACHE BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT LOW ESTROGEN AND LOW PROGESTERONE IMPACT VAZODILATION AND VAZO CONSTRICTION AND THE INFLAMMITORY RESPONSE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH HORMONE BASED HEADACHES IN PARTICULAR HORMOBA'S HEADACHES THAT OCCUR BECAUSE OF LOESTROGEN AND PROGESTRONE IN A MOMENT BUT THE KEYTHING TO KNOW IS SOMETHINGTHAT WE COVERED IN THE FERTILITY EPISODE I DID A VERY LONG VERY DETAILED EPISODE ON FERTILITIES OM NOKIN GOING TO GOING TO THIS IN SIGNIFICANT DETAIL NOW AND YOU CAN REFER TO THAT EPISODE OF FOR PROBABLY MORE DETAIL THAN YOU EVER WANTED BUT ALSO A LOT OF TOOLS AS IT RELATES TO FERTILITY IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES BUT RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GING TO GIVE YOU A COARSE OVERVIEW OF THAT IN ABOUT SIXTY TO A HUNDRED ND TWENTY SECONDS SO THAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN HORMONAL HEADACHES ARE MOST LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE KEEP IN MINE THAT HORMONA HEADACHES ARE MOST LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE WHEN ESTEROGEN AND PROGESTERONE ARE LOWEST SO IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT DURING THE FELICULAR STAGE OF THE OVULATORY SLASHMENSTRALCYCLE OCASO MESTRALCYCLES ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT DAYS ON AVERAGE NOT NEVERYONE BUTS ABOUT TWENTY DAYS ON AVERAG AND THE FIRST HALF OF THAT ESTROGEN STARTS CREEPING UP UUU U U UUP AND AS WE LEARN IN AND RCHONOLOGY ESTROGEN PRIMES PROGESTERONE SO ESTROGEN WILL THEN PIK AND THEN START TO FALL LOLELELELELELELO PRETTY QUICKLY RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE EGG OVULATES AND EGG IS RELEASED AND WILL ESSENTIALLY BE READY FOR FERTILIZATION IF THE EGG IS FERTILIZE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS HAPPEN AS IT RELEATS TO PREGNANCY IF NOT WHAT ENDS OF HAPPENING IS THAT DURING THE LUDIOL PHASE WHICH IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE THERE'S BEEN A BUILD UP OF THE LINING OF THE UTERUS BECAUSE OF AN INCREASE IN PROGESTRONE SO ESTROGEN GOES UP DURING THE FILICULAR PHASE THEN IT GOES DOWN AND THEN PROGESTRONE GOES UP U  U WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR GENERATING THAT THICK LINING OF THE UTERIS TO ALLOW THE FERTILIES EGGH IF ITS FERTILIES TO IMPLANT AND IF IT'S NOT FERTILIES ALL OF THAT GETS RELEASED FROM THE BODY IN THIS BLEEDING PROCESS THAT WE CALL MENSTRUATION IF MENSTRUATION OCCURS AND DAY ONE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLIS CONSIDERED THE FIRST DAIE WHICH BLEEDING OCCURS WILL THEN WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT ESTROGEN IS ALREADY LOW BECAUSE REMEMBER ESTROGEN WAS LO AT THE START OF THE PHILICULAR PHASE AND WHENT U   U U THEN IT COMES DOWN RIGHT AT THE TIME E BOBULATION AND PROGESTERONE GOES UP U UP U UP JURING THE LUDIOL PHASE IN FACT ITS MORE THAN A THOUSANDFOLD INCREASE IN PROGESTERONE BUT IF THERE'S NO FERTILIZATION OF TE EGGHE PROGESTRONE STARTS COMING DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN WHAT IS THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT ON THE FIRST TO ABOUT THE FOURTH OR FIFTH DAY OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE FIRST BEING THE FIRST DAY OF BLEEDING TILL ABOUT THE FOURTH OR FIFTTDAY OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE BOTH ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE ARE VERY VERY LOW AND IT IS HAT THAT TIME AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE  ABOUT THE FIRST WEEK OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE THE MANY WOMEN ARE VERY PRONE TO HORMONAL HEADACHES WHORMONAL HEADACHES NOT BECAUSE ESTROGEN'S HIGH THAT'S A COMMON MIS CONCEPTION RATHER BECAUSE ESTROGEN AN PROGESTRONE ARE BOTH LOW AND NOW THT YOU UNDERSTAND THE CONTOUR OR THE UNDER UNDERLYING REASONS FOR HORMONAL HEADACHE YOU CAN START TO ASK WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ESTROGEN IS LOW WELL ESTROGEN HAS STRONG IMPACTE ON THE VASOF DILATION VASOF CONSTRICTION SYSTEM AS DOES PROGESTERONE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT ELOBIT LATER BUT NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT HORMONAL HEADACHE IS AT LEAST THIS ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF HORMONAL HEADACHEWHICH IS VERY VERY COMMON GIVEN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN THAT ARE MENSTRATING AND THE FACT THAT LO ESTROGEN LO PROGESTERONE IS THE CAUSE OF THE HORMONAL HEADACHE AND THE FACT THAT OF COURSE THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE NO LONGER MENSTRUATING SO THERE EITHER IN PERYMENOPAUS AND MENSTRUATION IS BECOMING MORE INFREQUENT OR THERE IN MENOPAUS AND IT DECEASED ENTIRELY WELL NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ORIGEN OF THE HORMONAL HEADACHE IS AND SO ALL WE NEED TO KNOW IS WHAT DO ESTROGEN AN ROGESTERONE NORMALLY DU IN ORDER TO PREVENT HEADACHE AND THEREBY YOU'LL KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO OFFSET THAT IS PREVENT OR TREAT HORMONAL HEADACHE IN THAT FIRST WEEK OF THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD THE LAST TYPE OF HEADACH THAT AD LIKE TO DISCUSS IS HEADACHE ASSOCIATED WITH HEAD HITS THAT IS TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY ALTHOUGH I DEFILLY WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE FACT T HAT EVEN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY CAN EXPERIENCE HEADACHES AS THE CONSEQUENTS OF HITTING THEIR HEAD SO THE LINE BETWEEN TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND LOWER LEVEL BRAIN INJURY IS ONE THAT STILL SEEKS DEFINITION AND FACT THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR GOALS OF THE CLINICAL FIELD AS IT RELATES TO CONCUSSION AND IT'S ALSO WHAT COMES UP A LOT DURING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FOOTBALL IN THESE DAYS YOU'LL SEE PLAYERS HIT REALLY HARD AND DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT THEIR LAYING THERE FOR FIVE SECONDS THIRTY SECONDS OR THREE MINUTES OF THE CROWD AND THE A THE PEOPLE WATCHING ON TELIVISION AND EVERYWHERE ELSE ARE ALL SPECULATING AS TO WHETHER NOT THE PERSON SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLAY AND TO BE QUITE DIRECT THERE REALLY IS NO WAY TO ASSESS THE EXTENT OF BRAIN DAMAGE AFTER THE CONSEQUENCE OF HITTING ONE'S HEAD OR HAVING ONE'S HEAD HIT BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL ALMOST ALL OF THE BEST WAYS TO DETECT TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY EXCEPT THE MOST SEVERE ONES TEN TO REQUIRE A LOT OF VERY LARGE EQUIPMENT LIKE EMARI AND FUNCTIONAL EMARI AND C T SCANS NONE OF WHICH ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SIDE OF THE FIELD OR IN THE LOCKER ROOM BUT ALSO BECAUSE MANY MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE EFFECTS OF TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY ARE GOING TO RECUR NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE MINUTES OR EVEN HOURS AFTER THE INJURY BUT SEVERAL HOURS DAYS OR EVEN WEEKS AFTER THAT INJURY THIS IS THE DISCUSSION THAT WE SHOULD HOLD OFF FOR A LONGER FULL EPISODE ON TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY KEEPING IN MIND OF COURSE THAT FOOTBALL IS THIS VERY SALIENT EXAMPLE OF TRAMATIC BRIN INJURY IN CONCUSSION AS IS BOXING AS IS EVEN SOCKER WITH HEADING OF THE BALL BELIEVE AR NOT REPEATED LOW LEVEL IMPACT TO THE FOREHEAD AND OTHER PARTS OF THE HEAD O CAN GIVE RISE TO OVER TIME TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ANY KIND OF FULL BLOWN CONCUSSION OR BEING QOIN KNOCKED OUT BUT SPORTS RELATD CONCUSSION ACTUALLY OCCUPIES JUST A TINY FRACTION OF THE MAJORITY OF TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND CONCUSSION MOST TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND CONCUSSION AND LOW LEVEL BRAIN INJURY THAT CAN ACCUMULATE OVER TIME TO BECOME TRAMATIC FOR SAKE OF DAILY LIVING THAT IS LOWERED COGNITION DESTRUPTION IN MOOD SLEEP ET CETERA IS I THALLY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THINGS OTHER THAN SPORT SO FOR INSTANCE BICYCLE ACCIDENTS PLAYGROUND ACCIDENTS CONSTRUCTION ACCIDENTS AND THIS IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN FOR SOME REASON ALL THE SPORTS IN A PARTICULAR FOOTBALL TEND TO GRAB ALL THE ATTENTION AS IT RELATES TO CONCUSSION KEEP IN MIND THAT WHILE AT A FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE IS A PATH TO A LIVING FOR MOST PEOPLE TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY IS GOING OCCUR IN A CAR ACCIDENT CONSTRUCTION WORK AR OTHER TYPES OF WORK FOR WHICH PEOPLE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE MANY OPTIONS AND TERMS OF THE TYPE OF WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING SO THEY ARE PRONE TO CONCUSSIONS AND HEAD INJURIES SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THEIR WORK WITHOUT ANY YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CONTRACCS OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO NECESSARILY SOME CASES THEY DO BUT NECESSARILY TO DO OTHER THINGS AND CERTAINLY CAR ACCIDENTS OR BIKE BICYCLE ACCENS ARE NOT A VOLUNTARY EVENTS SO THE POINT BEING TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND HEADACHE RELATED TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE REALM OF SPORTS AND IN FACT VIEW A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY SO PEOPLE COMING INTO THE HOSPITAL OR CLINIC OR PEOPLE I'M CLAIMING THAT THE'VE GOT CONSISTENT HEADACHES ARE THERE NOT SLEEPING WELL THEIR MOOD IS OFF THE'RE FEELING MORE IRRITABLE AFTER HAVING HIT THEIR HEAD EVEN ONCE IS NOT THE CONSEQUENCE OF SPORTS IS GOING TOBE THE CONSEQUENCE OF ACCIDENTS ITHER ON A AT THE WORK PLACE OR I INTERMS TO A BICYCLE OR OTHER SORTS OF TRANSPORTATION BASED ACCIDENT LIKE A CAR ACCIDENT WITH THAT IN MIND ANY KIND OF HEAD HIT CERTAINLY IF INVOLVES OF CONCOSSION OR DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY OFTEN LEADS TO HEADACHES EITHER INFREQUENT BUT SEVERE HEADACHES OR CHRONIC LOW LEVEL HEADACHES OR FEELING THATHE'S KIND OF A STUFFINESS OR A FULLNESS TO THE HEAD THERE CAN BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ORIGINS TO THAT A COMMON ORIGIN IS GOING TO BE ACTUAL SWELLING OF THE NOT TO SUR THE BRAIN TISSUE DIRECTLY BUT IF YOU RECALL OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MININGIES WHICH INCLUDE THE DURA AND THE OTHER TISSUES THAT SURROUND THE BRAIN THERE SHA THREE LAYERS THAT WE CALL THE THE MNINGIES THE DURAGIS BEING ONE OF THEM AND THERE'S A VERY LITTLE SPACE BETWEEN THOSE THE BRAIN THE MANINGIES THAT SURROUND IT AND THE SKULL ATS CAL THE SUBBARACNOID SPACE OR REQOUAL MY ERACNOI LIKE SPITER WELL IF THERE'S EVEN A SLIGHT BIT OF SWELLING IN THE BRAIN OR EVEN DISTANT BRAIN TISSUES SO FOR INSTANCE EVEN IF THE THERE'S WHIP LASH SO THERE'S SWELLING OF THE TISSUE MUSCULAR TISSUE AND NURL TISSUE IN THE NECK AREA THAT CAN CON STRICT THE FLOW OF THINGS LIKE CEREBRALSPINAL FLUID BLOOD FLOW AND INDEED MUCUS AND OTHER OTHER THINGS THAT ESSENTIAL WE ALL HEEL HERE MUCUS THN WE THINK ILLNESS BUT MUCUS IS A VITAL VITAL O A SUBSTANCE WITHIN THE BODY FOR A LOT OF IMPORTANT REASONS IN HEALTH AS WELL AS IN SICKNESS WELL IF THERE'S LESS OF THAT LIQUID AND OTHER FLUIDS AND MUCUS BEING DELIVERED TO THAT SPACE WILL THEN IT CAN CLAW GOPSO SOR OF THE PLUMBING IS CLOGGED UP OR THAT IT'S CAUGHT AT THE LEVEL OF THE SIT OF HIT OR INJURY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME LOCAL SWELLING AND INFLAMMATION THERE SO THEREARE MANY DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THAT CAN UNDERLIE HEADACHE ASSOCIATED WITH HEAD HITS OR DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY NOW FORTUNATELY THERE'S SOME RECENT DATA POINTING TO SOME WHAT I WOIL CALL NON OBVIOUS TREATMENTS FOR HEADACHE IN DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY KEEPING IN MIND THAT ANY TIME WERE TALKING ABOUT INJURY OR DISEASE OR HEALTH FOR THAT MATTER MENTAL HEALTH OF PHYSICAL HEALTH WE HAVE TO HIGH LIGHT A FACT THAT'S GOING TO COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN IN EVERY SINGLE EPISODE OF THIS PODCAST AND I THINK IS NOT O BEING OVERLY REDUNDED TO DO SO WHICH IS THAT REGULAR SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF DEEP SLEEP EACH NIGHT ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR ALL ASPECTS OF MENTAL HAL PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF HEADACHE AND TO REDUCE THE TIME TO REPAIR AFTER DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND CAN IMPROVE COGNISION AND ON AND ON AND ON SO SLEEP IS ESSENTIAL FOR ALL THE NORMAL THINGS THAT ENCOURAGE HEALTHY ACTIVITY OF THE DIFFERENT TISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN BRAIN AND BODY TO OCCUR SO SLEEP DEPRIVATION OF COURSE IS GOING TO LIMIT THOSE BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SLEEP SUMLIGHT ANDI'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ALMOST A NAUSIUM ON THIS POD CAST BUT REGULAR CIRCATYAN CYCLES GETTING SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES EARLY IN THE DAY AND IN THE EVENING AS WELL AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITHOUT BURNING YOUR SKIN AND LIMITING YOUR EXPOSURE TO ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS AT NIGHT AND ON AND ON ALL OF WHICH IS COVERED IN THE LIGHT FOR HEALTH EPISODE OF THE UBERMAN LADPODCAST THE MASTER SLEEP EPISODE THE HUBRMAN LAPODCASTS AND IN THE PERFECT YOUR SLEEP EPISODE THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCASTIC AN FINAL THAT AT HUBERMAN LABDOT COM GETTING LIGHT AND AVOIDING LIGHT AT THE PROPER TIMES OF THE TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE IS ALSO GOING TO FAVOR ALL THE PATHWAYS RAINGING FROM GOT BRAIN ACCESS TO THE INFLAMMATORY ANTI INFLAMMETORY PATHWAYS NORL PATHWAYS ET CETERA THAT OF COURSE IF YOU DO THAT YOUARE GOING TO IMPROVE AND OFFSET ANY KIND OF DETRAMENT CAUSE BY TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY IS IT TREATING TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY DIRECTLY NO BUT IS NOT GETTING SUFFICIENT SLEEP NOT GETTING SUNLIGHT AT THE RIGHT TIMES OF DAY AND GETTNG TOO MUCH ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AT NIGHT GOING TO MAKE ANY IMPACT OF TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY INCLUDING HEADACHE FAR WORSE YES THERE ARE CERTAINLY A TONOF DATE TO SUPORT THAT STATEMENT AS WELL AND THEN OF COURSE NUTRITION AND EXERCISE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT SO WE CAN LIST OUT SLEEP SUN PROPER NUTRICION EXERCISE AND I WOULD PUT A PROPER SOCIAL CONNECTION WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO YOU HEALTHY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS INCLUDE ROMANTIC FRIENDSHIP FAMILIAL AND RELATIONSHIP TO SELF THOSE FIVE THING SLEEP EXERCISE SUN NUTRITION AND SOCIAL CONNECTION ARE ALL CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINING BASE LINES OF HEALTH AND RAISING YOUR BASE LINES OF HEALTH AND I MENTION THAT I CAN SEGMENT THIS OUT NOW BECAUSE I THINK THAT ANY TIME WE'RE ABOUT TO START DISCUSSING POINTED TREATMENTS THAT IS THINGS THAT YOU CAN TAKE OR DO TO REDUCE HEADACHE OR THINGS THA YOU CAN TAKE ER DO TO IMPROVE ANYTHING WITHIN MENTAL HEAL PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AN PERFORMANCE IS ONLY SET AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL BY TENDING TO THOSE OTHER THINGSTHAND THAT NOTHING REALLY SURPASSES ANY OF THOSE THINGS OR PUT DIFFERENTLY THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT FOR ANY OF THOSE THINGS IN THE FORM OF PILL A POWDER EVEN A BEHAVIOR OL PRACTICE THERE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO OFFSET GETTING LESS THAN IDEAL SLEEP TI THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE LIKE BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS DURING THE DAY TO TRY IN PARTIALLY OFFSET LACK OF SUNLIGHT BUT REALY THERE IS NO EXERCISE PILL THERE IS NO SUNLIGHT A DEVICE ALTHOUGH SUM BRIGHT LIGHTS ARE VERY BRIGHT THERE'S NO NO REPLACEMENT FOR ACTUAL SUNLIGHT THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT FOR ACTUAL SLEEP THERE'S NO REPLACEMEN FOR ACTUAL INTRICION AND I DO FEEL IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE AS WE HEAD INTO THE NEXT SAGMENT WHICH IS WHAT CIN YOU TAKE OR D TO REDUCE HEADACHE AND IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS WERE IN A START FIRST WITH THE HEADACHES ASSOCIATE WITH HEAD HITS AND TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY BECAUSE TURNS OUT THERE'S A  SURPRISING AND VERY USEFUL APPROACH TO DOING THAT BUT THIS SAME APPROACH ALSO CAN HELP OFFSET AND TREAT HEADACHE IN OTHER CONDITIONS AS WELL MEANING NOT JUST FOR HEADACHES CAUSED BY TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY BUT ALSO HEADACHES CAUSE BY SUDDEN ONSET TENSION HEADACHE OR MY GRAIN HEADACHE OR EVEN PERHAPS AGAIN PERHAPS CLUSTER TYPE HEADACHES SO THE FIRST SUBSTANCE THAT LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT HAS BEN SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE INTENSITY AND OR CREQUENCY OF HEADACHES IS CREATINE NOW CREATINE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SUPPLEMENT AN TAKHE MOST OFTEN CREATINE IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTECTS OF MUSCLE PERFORMANCE NOT JUS FOR PEOPLEWHO WEIGHT LIFT BUT FOR PEOPLE DO INDURANCE EXERCISE AND IT'S OFTEN BEEN SAID THAT FIVE TO TEN GRAHAMS PER DAY OF CREATINE MONOHYDRATE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH UWAY FIVE TO TEN GRIMS PERDAY OF CRETINE MONO HYDRATE CAN INCREASE CREATING PHOSPHATE STORES IN MUSCLES CAN BRING MORE WATER INTO MUSCLES CAN MAKE YOU STRONGER INCREASE POWER OUTPUT AND THAT IS ALL TRUE AS ALL COMPLETELY TRUE WE DISCUSSIS THAN THE HUBERMAN LABPODCASTS WITH DOCTOR ANDI GALPIN WHEN HE WAS A GUEST ON THE A HUBERAN LABPOD CASSER STANDARD SERIES AND WE DISCUSS HITS EXTENSIVELY IN AN UPCOMING EPISODE FROM DOCTOR ANDI GALPIN IN HIS SPECIAL SIX PART GUESS SERIES WHERE HE IS A GUEST ON THE HUBERM LABPODCASTS BUT WHERE REALLY HE'S THE ONE DOING THE MAJORITY OF THE TEACHING THAT SERIES COVERS EVERYTHING FROM STRANGTH HAPERTURFY ENDURANCE AND THERE'S AN EPISODE ON SUPPLEMENTATION WHERE WE GO DEEP INTO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CREATINE NOW IN THAT DISCUSSION AND AGAIN NOW WE HILATE THE FACT THAT CREATINE WHILE MOST OFTEN DISCUSSE ON LINE AND IN THE MEDIA AS A SUPPLEMENT FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE FOR THE REASONS I JUST MENTION ACTUALLY HAS FAR MORE DATA BEHIND IT THAT IS LABORATORY STUDIES EXPLORING THE ROLL OF CREATINE IN THE CLINICAL SETTING SO I LIKE THE HIHLIGHT OF PAPER FROM THAT LITERATURE NOW THAT WILL MAKE VERY CLEAR AS TO WHY CREATINE IS INTERESTING AND IN FACT VERY EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING HEADACHE AND PARTICULAR HEADACHE CAUSE BY HEADHITS ORTRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS PREVENTION OF TRAMATIC HEADACHE DIZZINESS END FATIGUE WITH CREATINE ADMINISTRATION NOW KEEP IN MIND THIS IS A PILOT STUDY IT WAS PERFORMED IN HUMANS SO WHEN YOU HEAR THAT WORDS CRECLINICAL THAT IS IF YOU HEAR THERE WAS A PRECLINICAL STUDY ON BLANK THAT MEANS ALMOST ALWAYS THAT THE STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON ANIMAL MODELS MICE RATS PRIMATES ET CETERA A CLINICAL TRIAL IS SOMETHING THAT'S CARRIED OUT ON HUMANS AND A PILOT STUDY MEANS THAT THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT ON HUMANS BUT ON A FAIRLY SMALL COHORITIFAIR FAIRLY SMLL GROUP A ORE LIMITED NUMBER OF SUBJECTS NONE THE LESS IF THE DATE ARE ROBUST AS IT IS IN THIS CASE OF THIS PAPER I THINK IT'S WORTH PAYING ATTENTION TO SO IN THIS STUDY WHAT THEY LOOKED AT WAS CREATINE ADMINISTRATION SO WHAT THEY DIS THEY HAD PEOPLE IN JEST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CREATING I'LL TELL YO IN A MOMENT IN FLUIDS WHO CON BE TAKEN IN WATER OR MILK WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT TIME OF DAY THEY HAD PEOPLE TAKE CRETING WHY WOULD THY HAVE PEOPLE TAKE CREATINE AFTER TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND IN PARTICULAR FOR PEOPLE THEIRE SUFFERING FROM HEADACE DIZZINESS FATIGUE ET CETERA THE REASON IS THAT NURONS NERVE CELLS RELY VERY HEAVILY ON THE REGULATION OF CALCIUM IN ORDER TO GENERATE THOSE ACTION POTENTIALS TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER SO DOESN'T MATTER OF IT'S A MOTOR NER ON A CENSERY NORON ORMOGULATORY NER ON THEY ALL GENERATE ACTION POTENTIALS OR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO ATE AND CALCIUM IS IMPORTANT FOR THAT PROCESS CALCIUM BECOMES DISREGULATED AFTER TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN PARTICULAR IN WAYS THAT IMPACT THE ENERGI PRODUCTION SYSTEMS OF CELLS AT ARE RELATED TO EI T P AT DENACINE TRYPHOSPHATE FOR THOSE A PYCIONATOS OF THERE THE ONE TO LOOK AT UP YOU CAN SIMPLY LOOK UP CALCIUM E T P AND NURONS AND YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT THAT CYCLE CREATINE CAN BE STORED IN MUSCLES AS WE TALKE ABOUT BEFORE BUT CREATINE AND IN PARTICULAR THE PHOSPORILATED FORM OF REATINE WHICH IS THE READILY AVAILABLE FUEL SOURCE FORM OF CREATINE CAN ALSO BE STORED IN BRAIN TISSUE AND IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE PROMINENTLY STORED IN THE FOREBRAIN THE AREA OR THE REAL ESTATE OF OF YOUR BRAIN JUST BEHIND THE FOREHEAD WHICH IS INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND ACTION AND UNDERSTANDING CONTECT SO AS VERY IMPORTANT FOR COGNITION SIMPORTANT FOR PERSONALITY TOO BUT'S IMPORTANT FOR NUMBER DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF LIFE  HAVE TO DO WITH MAKING PLANS BEING ABLE TOE FOCUS VERY INTENSELY ON YOUR WORK ET CETERA OR ON ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER ALL FUNCTIONS THAT BECOME HEAVILY DESTRUPTED IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND CONCUSSION CREATINES ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CALCIUM IN THE E T P SYSTEM WAS THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THE STUDY THAT IS THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZE ON THE BASIS OF PRECLINICAL DATA IN ANIMALS THAT BY INCREASING CREATINE STORES WITHIN THE BRAIN NOT JUST IN THE MUSCLE BUT IN PARTICULAR WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF CREATINE WOULD ALLOW FOR BETTER COGNE OF FUNCTION IN GENERAL NOW THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT COGNITION SPECIFICALLY IN THIS PAPER BUT THEY DID LOOK AT THE OTHER ASPECTS THAT IS THAT THE BAD STUFF ASSOCIATE WITH T B E AND THEY HAD PEOPLE SUPPLEMENT WITH CREATINE AT A LEVEL THAT IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE TYPICAL LEVEL THAT PEOPLE SUPPLEMENT WITH CREATINE SIMPLY FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE SO AS IY MENTION BEFORE MOST PEOPLE IF THEY SUPPLEMENT WITH CREATINE FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE THEY TAKE CREATINE MONOHYDRATE TYPICALLY FIVEGRAMS PER DAY SOMETIMES TEN GRAMS PER DAY IF THEREABOUT A HUNDRED KILEGRAMS OR OR GREATER IN BODY WEIGHT UNTER KILEGRAMS IS TWO HUNDRED APPROXIMATELY TWO UNDRED TWENTY POUNDS SO THE DOSES THAT WAS USE FOR UPPLEMENTING CRETINE IN THIS STUDY TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CREATINE ON HEADACHE DIZZINESS AND FATIGUE WAS QUITE A BIT HIGHER THEN THE DOSAGES USE SIMPLY FOR MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN THE STUDY THEY HAD PEOPLE TAKE A DOSE OF ZERO POINT FOR GRAHMS OF CREATINE MONOHYDRATE PER KILEGRAM OF BODY WEIGHT SO FOR SOMEBODY THAT WAIGHS A HUNDRED KILEGRAMS OR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS TAT WOULD BE FORTY GRAHMS OF CREATINE PER DAY HAVE SOMEONE WEIGHS HALF THAT MUCH THEY WOULD TAKE TWENTY GRAMS OF CREATINE PER DAY AND THEY DID THAT OVER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU TAKE CREATINE OVER AND OVER DAY TO DAY THAT THERE'S A BUILD UP OF CREATINE STORES BOTH IN THE MUSCLES AND WITHIN THE BRAIN TISSUE NOW WHAT THEY FOUND AS AE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS CRETINE ADMINISTRATION WAS REALLY STRIKING AND I THINK QUITE EXCITING THEY FOUND A VERY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF HEADACHE IN PEOPLE THAT WERE SUPPLEMENTING WITH CREATINE AS OPPOSE TO THE CONTROLS NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A PILOT STUDY BUT THE EFFECTS ARE VERY DRAMATIC THEY FOUND A VERY STATITICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF HEADACHE IN PEOPLE THAT WERE TAKING CREATINE IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONTROLS AND YOU SEE THAT THEIR BASICALLY GETTING HEADACHE AT A FREQUENCY OF NINETY PER CENT OR MORE AFTER TB  THE REDUCTION AND HEADACHE FREQUENCY IS DOWN TO ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE PER CENT IN THE PEOPLE TAKING CRETING SO THAT'S QUITE QUITE A DRAMATIC EFFECT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER MEASURES THEY TOOK KEEP IN MIND AGAIN THIS IS A PILOT STUDY SO LIMITED NUMBER OF SUBJECTS BUT AGAIN THE RESULTS ARE VERY IMPRESS OF WHT THEY FOUND IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING DIZZINESS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN PEOPLE SUPPLEMENTING WITH CRETINE AS WAS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING FATIGUE AND HAVE ACUTE FATIGUE AND CHRONIC FATIUE AGET NOT CHRONIC FATIGUE CINDRUM PER SAY BUT CHRONIC FATIGUE WHICH WAS IN THI STUDY DEFIND AS A GENERAL SENSE OF BODILY WEAKNESS AND EVEN MENTAL WEAKNESS  MENTAL WEAKNESS IS LITT BIT HARD TO QUANIFY BUT A THEY WERE VERY CAREFUL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COGNITIVE AND MENTAL FATIGUE VERSES PHYSICAL AND SEMATIC FATIGUE AN THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BOTH OF THOSE OCCUR IN TI B E OR POST TI B I THAT HEADACHE IS QUITE FREQUENT BASILY THE TAKE AWAY OF THE STUDY IS THAT FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HEADACHE DIZZINESS AND FATIGUE DU TAT B I AND PERHAPS AND I WONT UNDERLINE PERHAPS BECAUSE IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN EXPLORED YET BUT PERHAPS HEADACHE DIZZINESS AND FATIGUE DU TO OTHER CONDITIONS SYMPTOMS OR CAUSES OF HEADACHE CREATINE MONOHYDRATE SUPPLEMENTATION MIGHT BE AGAIN MIGHT BE AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE FOR PEOPLE TO TRY WHY DO WE SAY THAT WELL FIRST OF ALL CRETINE MONOHYDRATE IS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE IT'S CONSIDERED SAFE AT THE DOSAGES USED IN THES STUDY AND I CERTAINLY FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AND THERE ARE VERY FEW OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE AS SIGNIFICANT AN IMPACT ON HEADACHE OVER THE LONG TERM AS HAS CRETINE MONOHYDRATE IN THESE STUDIES OF PEOPLE WITH T B I IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO HILITE THE FACT THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM TI B EYES I MENTIONED EARLIER AND AS NOW THERE ARE VERY FEW TREATMENTS FOR T B I YOU TEND TO GET THE BASIC ADVICE COMING BACK AND IGAIN I THINK IT'S EXCELLENT ADVICIOU NO GET PROPER AMOUNTS OF SLEEP GET EXERCISE BUT DON'T GET ANOTHER DRAMATIC BRAIN INTRY THUTS OBVIOUS BUT YOU BE SURPRISED HOW MANY PEOPLE GO RIGHT BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE SYMPATHETIC TO THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T STOP WORKING OR GO ON DISABILITY SO MANYP YOU HOVE TO GO BACK TO WORK THAT COULD BE SPORTER COULD BE OTHER KIND OF WORK WHERE THEY ARE THEN SUBJECT TO PERHAPS GETTING MORE T B I MAYBE THE'RE ETTING LESS RESS AS A CONSEQUENCE AND STRESS I'VE SEE STRESSES A CONFOUNDING ISSUE FOR T B I BUT SLEEP EXERCISE SUN NUTRITION ALL OF THOSE THINGS PROPER SOCIAL CONNECTION ARE WHAT PEOPLE ARE ENCOURAGE TO DO WHEN THEY HAVE T B I BUT THERE 'VE BEEN VERY FEW COMPOUNDS IN PARTICLAR VERY FEW OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUNDS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE SAFE THAT HAVE SHOWN EFFICACY IN DEALING WITH T B  SO I THINK THAT WHILE THIS IS A A PILOT STUDY AND O WE CAN CONSIDER IT PRELIMINARY I THINK AM IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH IN THE EFFECTS WERE DRAMATIC ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE WITH HEADACHE AND PERITICULAR PEOPLE WITH TI B E OUGHT TO CONSIDER SUPPLEMENTING WITH CREATING IN ORDER TO DE L WITH THEIR HEADACHES AND OF COURSE I EAGERLY AWAIT OTHER STUDIES EXPLORING THE ROLL OF THIS HYDOSAGE OF CREATINE AR SHES A RELATIVELY HYDOSIGE OF CREATING MONOHYDRATE FOR OFFSETTING HEADACHE MEANWHILE I THINKTHERE ARE NUMBER PEOPLE OUT THERE SUFFERING FROM HEADACHE AM WHO MY CONSIDER USING CREETING MONOHYDRATE IN AN EXPLORATORY FACION IN SEEING WHETHER TO IN HELPS OFFSIT THEIR HEADACHES KEEP A MINE OF COURSE ANY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO ADD OR REMOVE ANYTHING A SUPPLEMENT ARE OTHERWISE FROM YOUR FROM YOURTREATMENT YOUR NUTRICIAN ET CETERA I DO SUGGEST THAT YOU CON SALT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN IN PARTICULAR I FOU HAF CHRONIC HEADACHE I DON'T SAY THAT TO PROTECT ME I SAY THAT OF COURSE TO PROTECT YOU WHAT I LIKE TO DISCUSS NEXT I FINE EXTREMELY EXCITING WHY WELL WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IS A COMPOUNDER I SHOULD SAY A SET OF COMPOUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OVER THE COUNTER THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF HEADACHES AND NOT JUST ONE KIND OF HEADACHE BUT MULTIPLE TYPES OF HEADACHES SO WHAT I'LL DESCRIBE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS IN REDUCING THE INTENSITY OR FREQUENCY OF TENSION TYPE HEADACHES MIGRING TYPE HEADACHES AS WELL AS HORMON TYPE HEADACHES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE MENSTRAL CYCLES THAT IT DESCRIBED EARLIER NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA CENTERED AROUND THIS GENERAL TOPIC BUT I'M AN A FOCUS ON THREE MAN PAPERS WHAT I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU YET OF COURSE IS WHAT IS THE COMPOUND THAT I'M REFERRING TO WHAT IS THIS OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUND WILL IT TURNS OUT THIS OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUND IS NOT JUST AVAILABLE OVER THE COUNTERITS ALSO AVAILABLE IN FOOD SO IT TURNS OUT THAT NUTRICIAN CAN HAVE A VERY STRONG IMPACT ON THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF HEADACHE ALTHOUGH SUPPLEMENTATION WITH THIS PARTICULAR COMPOUND CAN ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING AS WELL WHAT I'M REFERRING TO HERE ARE AMEGA THREE FADTY ACIDS MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH OMEGA THREE FATY ACIDS THESE ARE FADDY ACIDS THAT COME IN THE FORM OF SO CALED E P A AND D  CH  AND OMEGATHREEFATY ACIS ARE COMMONLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE SO CALLED OMEGA SIX FATY ACIDS OMEGA SIX FATY ACIDS COME IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT FOODS AND TH OF COURSE CAN BE SUPPLEMENT AS WELL OMGA THREE FAT ACIDS COME IN A BUNCHA DIFFERENT FOODS AND CAN BE SUPPLEMENT AS WELL COMMON FORMS OF OMEGA THREE FATY ACIDS IR SHULDS A COMMON SORCES OF OMEGA THREE FATY ACIDS IN FOODS INCLUDE FATY OCIAN FISH INCLUDING SAMMON SAMMON SKINS SARDINES ANSHOVIESE THINGS OF THAT SORT COMMON SOURCES IN SUPPLMENT FORM ARE SO CALLED FISH OIL CAPSULS OR LIQUID FISH OIL AGAIN OMEGA THRE FATY ACIDS AND ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN OR TALKING ABOUT OMGA THREE FATY ACIDS WERE TALKING ABOUT A COMMONATION OF E P A AND D  H  BUT REALLY IT IS THE QUANTITY OF E P A OMEGA THREE FADY ACIDS THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPACTFUL FOR THE SORTS OF HEALTHMETRICS THAT WERE IN A TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES NOW WITH RESPECT TO OMEGA SIX FATY ACIDS THE MOST TYPICAL FOOD SOURCES OF OMEGASIX FATY ACIDS ARE SEED OILS I KNOW NOWADAYS SEED OILS HAVE BECOME QUITE CONTROVERSIAL I'VE GIVEN MY STANCS ON THIS IN A A PRIOR POD CASBUT ALL JUST REPEAT IT FOR THOSE HOF YOU THAT HAVEN'T HEARD IT I AM NOT OF THE BELIEF THAT ALL SEED OILS ARE BAD THAT THER'RA LL IN FLAMMATORY THAT THEY ARE KILLING US ORE MAKING A SICK T THAT THEY ARE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF METABOLIC TIS FUNCTION ET CETERA HOWEVER I THINK IT IS VERY CLEAR AND I LEARN THIS FROM DOCTOR LAY NORTON WHEN HE WAS A GAST ON THIS PODCAST AND TAUT US ALL ABOUT NUTRITION ON IN GREAT DAPTHIT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT EPISODE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN NUTRITION THAT PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING A LOT MORE OIL GENERALLY AND A LOT OF THOSE OILS THAT PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING MORE OF NOWADAYS INCLUDE A LOT OF THE SO ALLED OMEGASIX FATYACIDS AND A LOT OF THOSE OILS ARE SEED OILS THE PARTICULAR OMEGASIX FATYACID THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEVANT FOR TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS LINOLIC ACID AND THAT IS COMMON IN A LOT OF SEED OILS SO AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THAT SEED OILS ARE BAD HOWEVER IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING FAR TOO MANY SEED OILS AND IN DOING SO ARE CONSUMING FAR TOO MANY CALLORIES AND PERHAPS ARE CONSUMING TOO MUCH OF THE OMAGA SIX FATYACIDS RELATIVE TO THE OMEGA THREE FATIACIDS NOW WITH THAT SAID I THINK THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT AMONG NUTRITIONISS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT WE COULD ALL STAND TO GET MORE OMEGA THREE FATIACIDS PERHAPS FOR CARDOVASCULAR HEALTH OF THE VESILOBIT DEBATED BUT CERTAINLY FOR IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION FOR MOOD AND FOR FUNCTIONING THE BRAIN AND FOR THE PODENT ANTI AN FLAMMATORY EFFACTS OF OMEGA THREES SO AGAN OMEGATHREES CAN BE SOURCED FROM FOOD BOTH ANIMA BASE AND PLANTBASE YOU CAN SIMPLY GO ON LINE AND LOOK UP THE VARIOUS FOOD BASE SOURCES BUT IN THINKING ABOUT HEADACHE AND DIFFERENT TREATMENTS FOR HEADACHE THERE ARE SOME RECENT STUDIES EXPLORING HOW SUPPLEMENTING WITH OMEGA THREE FATIACIDS AND IN ONE CASE HOW SUPPLEMENTING WITH OMGA THREE FATIACIDS AND DELIBERATELY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF LINOLIC ACID THE OMEGA SIX FATIACIDS HOW THAT CAN IMPACT HEADACHE SO THE FIRST STUDY I LIKE TO DESCRIBE IN REFERENCE TO THE ROLL OF OMEGA THREE FATIACIDS AND HEADACHE WAS PUBLISHIN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS LONG CHAIN OMEGA THREE FATIACIDS AND HEADACHE IN THE US POPULATION THEIR NUMBER OF THINGS THA I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THE STUDY A FEW OF THOSE INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THEY LOOKED AT AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT IS THEY INCLUDED TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDR AND SEVENTEEN MEN AND WOMEN ELIKETHE FACT THAT TH INCLUDED MEN AND WOMEN IN THE STUDY AGE TWENTY OR OLDER AND THAT THEY BROKE DOWN THE POPULATION IN TO CATEGORIES THAT INCLUDED AGE THEY CERTAINLY LOOKED AT A RACINETHNICITY THEY LOOKED AT EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND THEY LOOKD AT BODY MASS TOTAL ENERGY IN TAKHE WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT PEOPLE ARE GOING T BE EATING AND WITHIN THE THINGS THAT THEY EAT THEY'RE GOING TOBE CONSUMING SOME OMEGA THREES HOPEFULLY AS WELL SOME OMEGASIXES AND IF THE'RE EATING FAR MORE THAN THEIR GOING TO GET FAR MORE OF LIKELY GOING TO GET FAR MORE OF BOTH OF THOSE THINGS THAN THEY WOULD ORDINARILY IF THEY WERE EATING SMALLER AMOUNT SO THEY CONTROLLED FOR TOTACLORIC INTACHE IN A WAY THAT I FIND A PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR LOOKING THESE KIND OF DATA SO THE REASON THEY EXPLORED OMEG THREES IS WORTH MENTIONING OMGATHREE FATYACIDS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE IN ANTI AND FLAMMATORY A FACT THAT ANTI AM FLAMMETORY EFFECT IS MEDIATED THROUGH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PATHWAYS WE WON'T GO INTO THESE IN TOO MUCH DETAIL NOW BUT THE OMEG ATHRE FADTIACIDS KEEP IN MINE ACTUALLY MAKE UP VARIOUS PARTS OF CELLS IN THE BRAIN IN BODY ASTRITE THE MEMBRANE THAT MEMBR TALK BEFORE ABOUTT STORID HORMONES CAN GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT MEMBRANES OF THE CELLS THE OUTER MEMBRANE IN THE INNER MEMBRANE A LOT OF THOSE ACTUALMEMBRANES THE STRUCTURAL CONSTITUENTS OF NURONS AND OTHER CELLS ARACTUALLY MADE UP OF OR INCLUDE CERTAIN FADTIACID LONGSHANE FADIACIDS AND THE OMEGATHREE FADIACIDS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THOSE TISSUES AS WELL AS HAVING ANTINE FLAMMATORY EFFECTS THROUGH THINGS LIKE LIMITING PROSTIG LANDINS AND OTHER THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE INFLAMMATION CASE O THEIR BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT OMEGATHREE FADIACIDS CAN BE USEFUL THEY REFER IN THIS STUDY TO AN EARLIER STUDY THAT LOOK TO THE SO CALLED ANALGESIC EFFECT THE PAIN RELIEVING EFFECTANOGESIC MEANS PAIN RELIEVING EFFECT OF OMEGATHREE FADIACIDS IN WHAT HAD BEEN A ARANDOMIZE CONTROL TRIAL AND IN THAT PREVIOUS PAPER WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT DIOT'S HIONOMEGATHREES AND LOW INOMEGASIXIS OCASE A HIG THREE LO SIX AND AS COMPARED TO DIETS THAT WERE JUST REDUCED OMEGASIXES THEY FOUND A GREATER ANALGESIC EFFECT OF INCREASING OMGATHREES WHILE ALSO REDUCING OMGASIX FADIACID SO IN THE CONTICTS OF THE SEED OIL DISCUSSION ALTHOUGH KEEPING IN MINDED OMEGASIXES CAN COME FROM OTHER SOURCES AS WELL IF OMEGASIXES WERE JUST REDUCED ON THEIR OWN THERE WASN'T AS GREATAN EFECT INTERMS OF REDUCING PAIN AND INFLAMMATION AS THERE WAS WHEN OMEGATHREE FADACIDS WERE DELIBERATELY INCREASED AND OMEGASIX FADIACIDS WERE REDUCED AGAIND IN ALL OF THESE STUDIES BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ONES IN WHICH THEY ACONTROLLED THINGS WELL AS WE S AS WE SAY THEY ARE HOLDING CONSTAN THE COLORIC INTAKES OS MUCH JUS THAT YOUR REMOVING FAT EATING LESS FACT THERE'S ACTUALLY A REMOVAL OF CERTAIN FATS AND FADACIDS AND A REPLACEMENT OF THOSE WITH OMEGATHREE FADIACIDS IN ONE CASE IN THE OTHER CASES JUST A REDUCTION IN OMEGASIXES AND YOU'RE USING OTHER FOOD TYPES IN MACRONUTRIENTS TO OFFSET THAT REDUCTION IN CALORIES CUSE BY REDUCING OMEGASIXES THE BASIC TAKE AWAY THAT THEIRE RELYING ON MARCHING INTO THE STUDY IS THAT INCREASING OMEGATHREES IN REDUCING OMGASIXES SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCING PAIN AND INDEED IN THIS STUDY THEY FIND SOMETHING QUITE SIMILAR WHICH IS THAT WHEN YOU HOLD COLORIC AN TAKE CONSTANT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT OMEGASIXES WHETHER NOT OU DECREASE OMEGASIX FADIACIDS ARE NOT YOU FIND IS THAT INCREASING OMEGATHREE FADIACIDS IN THE DIET SO EITHER CONSUMED THROUGH FOOD SOURCES OR BY SUPPLEMENTATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER PREVALENCE OF SEVERE HEADACHE OR MIGRANE SO SEVERE TENSIONTYPE HEADACHE OR MIGRAN S THIS IS PROMISING AND POINTS TOF THE FACT THAT LONG CHANOMEGATHRE FADIACIDS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE EITHER A PAIN REDUCING AND THERE'S EVIDENCE FOR THAT AND OR IN INFLAMATION REDUCING EFFECT THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF HEADACHE IN BOTH TENSIONTYPE HEADACHE AND IN MIGRANE SO THAT'S THE FIRST STUDY THE SECOND STUDY IS A MORE RECENT STUDY IS PULISHIN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT USED O I WOULD SAY A MORELES SIMILAR TYPE OF OVERALL DESIGN IS THE ONE I REFERED TO EARLIER  THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS DIETARY ALTERATION OF WHAT THEY CALL N THREE BUT THOSE AREOMEGATHREE AND NSIX OMEGASIX SORRY FOR THE SHIFTIN NOMIN CLACIOR I DIDN'T WRITE THE PAPER DIETARY ALTERATION OF OMEGATHREE AND OMEGASIX FADIACIDS FOR HEADACHE REDUCTIONS IN ADULTS WITH MIGRANE AND THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL RANDOMIZE CONTROL TRIALS INVOLVE HAVING PEOPLE BE IN ONE CONDITION WHERE THEY DO ONE THING AND THEN THEY GET SWAPPED RANDOM LY INTO ANOTHER CONDITION SO THEY SERVE AS THEIR OWN INTERNAL CONTROL AND THAT CONTROLS FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE DIFFERENCES IN SEX DIFFERENCES IN AGE DIFFERENCES IN HELTH BACKGROUND IN ANY NUMBER OF OTHER VARYABLES AS BESTIS ONE CAN IN THIS STUDY THEY HAD PEOPLE EITHER IN JEST A DIET THAT HAD INCREASED OMEGATHREES SO INCREASED E P  ND D H  OR INCREASED E P A AND D H A AND REDUCED AMOUNTS OF LINOLIC ACID O CASE O THAT'S GOING TO REDUCE OMEGASIXES OR A CONTROL DIET IN WHICH THEY HAD PEOPLE TAKING WATS ESSENTIALLY THE AVERAGE IN TAKHE OF OMEGATHREES AND OMEGASIXIS AND YOUCA PROBABLY ALREADY GES WHAT THE GENERAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY ARE GOING TO BE THE GENERAL RESULTS WERE THAT THERE WERE REDUCTIONS IN HEADACHES OK THE REALLY COOL THING ISAT WAS A MASSIVE REDUCTION IN HEADACHE OY THIS WAS A THEY REFER TO IT AS A ROBUST REDUCTION IN IT HEADACHE IN PARTICULAR FOR THE SUBJECTS THAT INCREASED THEROMEGATHREES AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LINOLIC ACID THAT THEY TOOK THE OTHER THING T A I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS STUDA IS THAT WHILE THEY DON'T KNOW THE EXACT UNDERLYING MECHANISM FOR THE EFFECT THEY DID SPEND SOME TIME DELINEATING WHAT IT IS THAT THE OMEGATHREE AND OMEGASIX FADIACIDS ARE LIKELY DOING TO EITHER OFFSET OR EXACERBATE HEADACHE NOW I DIDN'T SAY THAT OMEGASIX FADIACIDS EXACERBATE HEADACHE BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT PEOPLE WHO IN JEST MORELINOLIC ACID IN OMEGASIX OR EXPERIENCING MORE INFLAMATION AND THAT IS EVIDENT IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS ONE FOR INSTANCES ARE INCREASES IN THINGS LIKE C G R P C G AR P IS A MOLECULE THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THE CALCIUM SIGNALING PATHWAY ITS INVOLVED IN VASO DILATION THE EXPANSION OF THE BLOOD VESSELS AND CAPLERIES AND THAT'S KNOWN AS I MENTION EARLIER TO EXACERBATE CERTAIN FORMS OF HEADACHE I THERE ALSO FORMS OF HEADACHE THAT BE CAUSED BY VAS OF CONSTRICTION WILL TALK ABOUT ONE VERY DRAMATIC EXAMPLE PERHAPS AS WE GET TOWARD THE ND OF IT'S A VERY UNCOMMON EXAMPLE BUT AM IT'S A IT'S CALLED THUNDER CLAP HEADACHE AND TRUST ME YOU DO NOT WANT THUNDER CLAP HEADACHE AMENCE WEILL TALK ABOUT THUNDERCLAP HEADACHE LOVIT THEY ARE THAT INVOLVES CONSTRICTION OF THE BLOOD VESSELS IN ANY CASE IN THIS PAPER THEY THEY DIN'T STUDY MECHANISM DIRECTLY BUT THERE RESTING ON THIS KNOWN ANAL GESIC ANTI PAIN AS WELL AS KNOWN ANTI IN FLAMMATORY PATHWAYS RELATED TO INCREASING OMEGA THREE AND TAKE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY RESTING ON THE IDEA I THINK THAT WE NOW CAN SAK CONCLUSION THAT OMEGA SIX FADIACIDS IN PARTICULAR LINOLIC ACID CAN INCREASE INFLAMMATION BY WAY OF INCREASING THINGS LIKE C G R P FASE OF DILATION AND SOME OTHER PATHWAYS RELATED TO THE SO CALLED INFLAMATORY SID OF KIND PATHWAYS AND THERE'S A WHOLE DISCUSSION NOW DAYS WHAT'S ALLED THE INFLAM ATOME SO THE BASIC TAKE AWAY IS THAT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN REDUCING HEADACHE IT MAY BE BENEFICIAL AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THESE TWO STUDIES AND ANOTHER ONE ILL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT TO INCREASE AMOUNTS OF OMAGA THREE FADIACIDS AND THAT CAN BE DONE AGAIN THROUD THE INGESTIONS OF FOODS ALTHOUGH BASED ON THE DOSAGES THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT INCREASING OMEGA THREE FADIACIDS BY TAKING LIQUID FORM FISH OIL WHICH IS PERHAPS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO SUPPLEMENT OMEGA THREES OR CAPSILS WHICH IS PERHAPS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO SUPPLEMENT OMEGA THREES REALLY TO A LEVEL OF ONE GRAHAM OR MORE OF E P A PER DAY AGAIN THAT'S THE E P A FORM IN PARTICULAR SO IF YOUR FOR INSTANCE TAKING SUPPLEMENTAL FISH OIL OR YOUR GETTING YOUR OMEGA THREES FROM FOOD IN YOUR GETTING A WHAT YOU DETERMINE TO BE TWO THOUSAND MILIGRAMS ARE TWO GRAHAMS PER DA OF OMAGA THREES KEEP IN MYN THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE E P A N D  CH  AND IT DOES SEEM THE GETTING ABOVE ONE GRAHAM PER DA OF E P A OMEGA THREE FADIACIDS EITHER THROUGH FOOD OR SUPPLEMENTS OR BOTH IS GOING TO BE THE CRITICAL THRESHOLD FOR REDUCTIONS IN THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF HEADACHE THAT INCLUDE BOTENTION HEADACHES AND MY GRAIN HEADACHES NOW SOME PEOPLE WILL FIND ACTUALLY THAT INJESTING FAR MORE OMEGATHREE FATIACIDS GENERALLY THROUGH SUPPLEMENTATION WOULD AGAIN CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED THOUGH FOODS AS WELL CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL FOR OTHER THINGS SUCH AS MOOD AND INDEED THERE'S A WHOLE LITERATURE RELATED TO EFFECTS OF INJESTING ONE TO THREE GRAHAMS AGAIN THREE GRAHAMS PER DAY OF E P A THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE QUITE A HIGH INTAKHE OF OMGA THREES ON WHATEVER FORMER SUPPLEMENT YOU DECIDE TO TAKE THOSE INTO YOUR BODY BUT THAT THAT CAN IMPROVE MOOD AND SO FORTH THE BASIC RANGE THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND IN THE META ANALYSIS SOMETTA ANALYSIES ARE WERE A RESEARCHER WILL A LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STUDIES FOCUSSED ON THE SAME THING LOOK AT A THE DFFERENT STRENGTH OF THOSE STUDIES THEY'LL DO ALL SORTS OF  COOL STATISTICAL GYMNACICS LIKE REMOVE THE MOST POTENT STUDY THE ONE THAT HAD THE GREATEST EFFECT AND SEE WHETHER NOT THEIR STILL AN EFFECT OF SOME TREATMENT OR FOR INSTANCE THEY WILL A SWAP IN AND OUT A DIFFERENT STUDIES IN DIFFERENT COMMINATIONS TO SEE WHETHER NOT ANY ONE STUDY IS REALLY LEADING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A GIVEN TREATMENT DOES SOMETHING IN ANY CASE IN THE META ANALYSIES OF OMEGA THREE FADACIDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEADACHE AND THAT INCLUDES ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF HEADACHE BUT THEY FOUND IN EXPLORING A HUGE RANGE OF OMEGA THREE SUPPLEMENTATION RANGING FROM TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS ALL THE WAY UP TO TWO THOUSAND MELIGRAMS PER DAY IT REALLY WAS AT THE ONE GRAHAM OR HIGER DOSAGE PER DAY WERE THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND REDUCING HEADACHE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY WAS FOUND AND JUST VERY BRIEFLY EARLIER I MENTION THAT NOT ONLY AS OMEGA THREE FADIACID SUPPLEMENTATION BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF HEADACHE IN TENSION TYPE AND MIGRANE TYPE HEADACHE BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR PREMENSTRUAL SYNDRUM RELATED HEADACHES THESE ARE WHAT WE REFERRD TO EARLIER AS HORMONE BASED HEADACHES AGAIN THE LO ASTROGEN LOW PROJASTERONE ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PHASES OF THE MENSTRAL CYCLE AS WELL AS OTHER PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH HEADACHEIN A STUDY ENTITLED EFFECT OFE OMEGA THREE FADIACIDS ON PREMENSTRUAL CYNDRUM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND AGAIND METAANALYSIS WHAT THEY FOUND IN HERE ON PARAPHRASING THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT OMEGA THREE FATYACIDS COULD YES EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF P AM A SYMPTOMS AND ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS IN PARTICULAR THAT THEY FOUND WTHAT WAS REDUCED WAS THE PAIN RELATED SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH HEADACHE AND THEY ACE SHE HAD SOME VERY NICE HYPOTHESIES AS TO WHY THAT LIKELY WOULD BE AM AND IN FACT POINT OUT THAT IN EARLIER STUDIES OMEGA THREE FATIACIDS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN CONSIDERED AS NONSTEROIDAL ANTIONFLAMATORY DRUGS IN SOME CASES AND INDEED THERE ARE PRESCRIPTION FORMS OF OMEGA THREE FADYACIDS AND A HIGHLIKE THAT NOT BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO RUN OUT AND GET THE PRESCRIPTION FORM OF OMEGA THREE FADYACIDS THRACHLL QUITE HARD TO OBTAIN AND QUITE EXPENSIVE BUT BECAUSE I THINK OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE OMEGA THREE FADYACIDS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE VAILABLE OVER THEY COUNTER IN A SUPPLEMENT OR BY LIQUID OR AVAILABLE IN FOOD FOR THAT MATTER LEADS MANY PEOPLE TO CONCLUDE THAT OH YOU KOW THIS IS SUPPLEMENTATION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AM U KNO ITS GOING TO HAVE RELATIVELY WEAK OR MINOR INPACT ON THINGS LIKE HEADACHE OR OTHER HALTHMETRICES BUT A LET'S TO SAY THAT THE FACT THAT IT EXISTS AS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG IN ITS HIGHEST POTENCY FORM LEAST IN MY OPINION POINTS TO THE POTENCY OF OMEGA THREE FADYACIDS IN DEALING WITH ANALGESIC OF FACTS THAT IS REDUCING PAIN AND ANTIIN FLAMATION AS WELL AS SOME OF THE A KNOWN CARTYOF ASCULAR IMPROVEMENTS THEIR SOCIATE WITHINCREASING OMEGATHREE FADYACID INTACHE PUT SIMPLY OMGA THREES ARE NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM FOOD OR SUPPLEMENTS THEY ARE ALSO BEING MARKET AT ATS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SO I DO THINK THEY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS QUITE POTENT AND AT LEAST AS FAR AS THESE PAPERS THAT AGAIN INCLUDE METANALYSIES OF MANY OTHER PAPERS IN DATA CETS INDICATE THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH OMEGA THREE FADYACIDS TO A POINT WHERE YOU ARE GEADING ABOVE ONE GRAM PREDAY OF EP A IS NOT JUST GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR TREATING AND REDUCING THE THREEQUENCEDE INTENSITY OF ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF HEADACHE BUT MANY TYPES OF HEADACHES AND WHEN YOU COMBINE HORMONAL HEADACHES TENSION HEADACHES AND MYGRANE HEADACHES YOU ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE TOTAL TYPES OF HEADACHES THAT ARE OUT THERE A THE EFFECTS OF OMEGA THREES ON CLUSTER HEADACHES AND SOME OF THE OTHER TYPES OF HEADACHES LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED AND THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT OMEGA THREES WOULD NOT BE BENEFICIAL FOR THOSE TYPES OF HEADACHES BUT AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE DATA SETS WE TALKED ABOUT HERE ARE CONCERN IT IS CLEAR OMEGA THREE FADYACIDS ARE GOING TO BE A VERY POTENT WAY TO REDUCE PAIN AND TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION IN WAYS THAT CAN REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND THE INTENSITY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF HEADACHE BEFORE WE CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT MANY NOT COMMONLY KNOWN AND YET VERY POTENT TREATMENTS FOR DIFFERENT FORMS OF HEADACHE I WANT TO TOUCH ON TA TOPIC WE MENTIOND TO LOBI EARLIER AND ALSO PROVIDE A TREATMENT THAT IS IN A WAY TO ALLEVIATE SOMETHING AND THAT'S PHOTOPHOBIA AND ORA NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT EARLIER I REFERRED TO ORA AS THIS SENSE THAT SOMETHINGIS ABOUT TO HAPPEN THAT IS TRUE AND THAT MEANING THAT IS AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ORA BUT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE ALSO COME TO UNDERSTAND ORA AS THE FEELING THAT SOMETHING SURROUNDS A GIVEN OBJECT VISUALLY OR EVEN THAT PEOPLE HAVE A SENSE THAT SOMETHING'S AROUND THEM SO AGAIN THIS CAN BELOBIT VAGUE BUT THIS IDEA THAT ORA IS A SENSE OF SOMETHING ABOUT TO HAPPEN OR THAT VISUALLY OR IN AN AUDITORY WAY AND OR EVEN IN KIND OF A SENSE THAT SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT IN THE REASON I MAKING A KIND OF ARC SHAPES WITH MY HANDS FOR THOSE O EITHEIR JUST LISTENING I MAKING ART SHAPES WITH MY HANDS IS THAT ORA'S OFTEN DISCRIBED AS KIND OF A HALO OR A U EMANATING OUT FROM FROM ONE'S BODY OR FROM SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT AGAIN NOTHING SPIRITUAL ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTECTS OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT MYGRAIN AND HEADACHE BUT RATHER MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE PHOTOPHOBIA SOMETIMES WITH ORA SOMETIMES KNOW AND I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH ORIMPHOTOPHOBIA OCCUR AND MENTION JUST BRIEFLY A PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHE WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN START TO OFF SET PHOTOPHOBIA AND AGAIN I MENTION THAT BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE PHOTOPHOBIA IN HEADACHE BUT THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE PHOTOPHOBIA EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE INTENSE HEADACHE O PHOTOPHOBIAS A PRETTY COMMON PRETTY DEBILITATING IT ACTUALLY SO WHEN THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE FEEL NOT WELL IN TEE TO LEAVE WORK OR NOT GO TO SCHOOL OR A OR LEAVE SCHOOL THESE KINDS OF THINGS WERE LAY IN BED ALL DAY OR DIM THE LIGHTS NOT GO OUTSIDE AGAIN SONLIGHT BEING SO A CONGRUENT WITH HEALTH A YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PHOTOPHOBIA CAN LEAT TO ALL SORTS OF A NEGATIVE DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCES WOCASE OF WHAT IS ORA AND WHAT IS PHTOPHOBIA THE EXACT ORIGINS OF ORA AREN'T EXACTLY CLEAR BUT IT IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT WHAT ORA REPRESENTS IS WHAT'S CALLED SPREADING DEPRESSION AND THIS IS NOT DEPRESSION OF ONE'S MOOD ALTHOUGH CAN BE ASSOCIATE WITH THAT THIS IS DEPRESSION OF NORONAL ACTIVITY AGAIN NURANS COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER BY GENERATING ELECTRICAL IMPULSES THAT TRAVEL DOWN THE LENGTH OF THEIR OF THEIR SO CALLED AXONS WHICH ARE LIKE WIRES AND THEN THEY DUMPNER O TRANSMITTER OUT AT THE SO CALLED SYNAPS AND IMPACT THE ELECTRIC ELECTIVITY OF OTHER NURANS DEPRESSION IS A ELECTRICAL OR I SHOULD SAY A CENMO GO ELECTRICAL KHEMO ELECTRICAL IS THE PROPER TERM PHENOMENON IN WHICH THE EXCITABILITY OF NURANS IS REDUCED SO AGAIN DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH DEPRESSION AS A MOOD STATE PER SAY RATHER IT IS A REDUCED EXCITABILITY OF NURANS AND IT'S BEEN SHOWN IN SOME IMAGING STUDIES THAT ORA IS ASSOCIATE WITH A BACK TO FRONT SO FROM THE BACK OF THE BRAIN TO FRONT SPREADING DEPRESSION LIKE A WAVE OF LOWERING LEVELS OF ELECTRICAL EXCITABILITY AND BECAUSE THIS ORIGINATES IN THE VISUAL QUARTEX WHICH IS IN THE BACK SO THATS THE PART OF YOUR BRAIN THAT IS MAKING SENSE OF VISUAL IMAGES COMING IN THROUGH THE EYES AND RELAID THROUGH OTHER STATIONS IN THE BRAIN THAT PEOPLE WILL START TO SEE A COND OF HALO OF LIGHT OR THAT THEY'LL START TO FEEL THAT THE LIGHT AROUND THEM IS LITERALLY SURROUNDING THEIR BODY OR SOME OTHER OBJECT OR BODY THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN IT SPREADS FORWARD IN THE BRAIN AND THAT'S WHEN IT TENDS TO STRETCH OVER INTO OTHER SO CALLED CENSORY MEDALITIES CENSRY MODALITIES BEING THINGS LIKE TOUCH OR HEARING SO PEOPLE WILL GET THE SENSE THAT KIND OF SEEING SOMETHING IN THEIR PERIPHERI OF THEIR VISION THAN THEY'LL START FEELING SOMETHING AROUND THEM THERE'S O SENSE THAT SOMETHINGIS ABOUT TO HAPPEN SO AS THE SPREADING WAVE OF DEPRESSION GOES FROM BACK TO FRONT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A NUMBER OF THESE DIFFERENT SEMI ABSTRACT CENSORY PHENOMENA THAT WE CALL ORA OCASS SO THAT'S HOW ORORIGINATES NOW PHOTOPHOBIA IS A LITTLE BUT DIFFERENT PHOTOPHOBIA WE NOW UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF SOME BEAUTIFUL WORK THAT WAS DONE AT CLIFF SAPERS LAB AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND SOME OTHER LABORATORIES SHOWING THAT PHOTOPHOBIA ORIGINATES FROM A SPECIFIC SET OF NURONS IN THE EYE WE CALL THESE THE INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE MELONOPS AND GANGLING CELLS WHICH IS REALLY JUST A MOUTHFUL OF NERVE SPEAK FOR NURONS IN THE EYE THAT CONNECT TO THE BRAIN THESE SO CAL GANGLIAN CELLS THAT RESPOND MOST ROBUSTLY TO BRIGHT BLUE LIGHT OR OTHER SHORT WAVE LENGTH LIGHT S YOU GOT SHORT WAVELENGTH LIGHT THAT IS BLUE AND GREENS ARE SHORT WAVE LENGTHS AND THEN LONG WAVELIN LIGHT WHICH IS RED OR IOU IT CAN EVEN BE A OUTPASS RAY L BE INPHERE WE DON'T DETECT HIM FOR RED CONSCIOUSLY OTHER SPECIES DO LIKE PITVIPER CAN SIE IN THE IMPHERED THEY CAN EVEN HEAT SENSE SO SHORT WAVE LANGTH LIGHT IS GOING TO BE LIGHT THAT'S THAT'S BRIGHT A BLUE GREEN IT'S WHAT'S VERY COMMON IN FLORESCENT BULBS THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN ON HOUSEHOLD LIGHTING AND WORKPLACE LIGHTING AND OTHER FORMS OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING IT'S ALSO OF COURSE PRESENT IN SUNLIGHT SUNLIGHT INCLUDES A HUGE RANGE OF WAVELANGTS INCLUDING LONG WAVELINGTH LIGHT OF COURSE YOU'VE EEN THAT AS THE REDS AND ORANGES IN THE SUNSET AND SO ON THOSE INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE RETINAL GANGLIN CELLS IN THE EYE RESPOND BEST TO BRIGHT GREEN OR BLUE LIGHT AND THEY SEND CONNECTIONS TO A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE BRAIN INCLUDING THE SO CALLD CER CENSRAL CIRCATIANG CLOCKS SUPERCISE MATNUCLEAS THAT SETS YOUR DAY NIGHT SLEEP WAKE RHYTHMS THIS IS WHY I ENCURAGE PEOPLE TO VIEW SUNLIGHT IN TE MORNING TO SET THIS SYSTEM IN MOTION TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE AT NIGHT FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES IN ORDER TO NOT SEND WAKE UP SIGNALS FROM THE EYE TO THE BRAIN AND THEN ON TO THE REST OF THE BODY BUT THESE INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE RETTINAL GANGLIN CELLS ARE ALSO KNOWN TO CONNECT WITH OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAIN MANY OTHER AIRS OF THE BRAIN IN FACT AND ONE OF THE IMPORTANT AREAS OF THE BRAIN THEY CONNECTO AS IT RELATES TO PHOTOPHOBIA IS AN AREA OF A STRUCTURE CALL THE FHALYMUS THE THALMUSES AN EGLIKE STRUCTURE THAT SITS IN THE CENTER OF THE BRAIN AND IT SERVES AS A KIND OF A SWITCHBOARD LIKE A CENSORY RELAY BY WHICH INFORMATION COMING FROM THE EYES FROM THE EARS FROM THE TOUCH SYSTEM ET CETERA ARE FUNNELED INTO DIFFERENT COMPARTMENTS IN THE THALMAS AND THEN SENT TO DIFFERENT OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAIN SO THINK OF IT CONLIC AN OLD FASHIONED SWITCHBOARD OR AM YOU COULD THINK OF IT A SORT OF LIKE A IN AN AIRPORT YOU GO A TO A PARTICULAR UM WING OF THE AIRPORT THAN YOU GO T OF PARTICULAR GAIT AND SO ON YOU R GETTING FUNNELED PROGRESSIVELY THROUGH A NARROWER NARRER CHANNELS UNTIL YOU ARRIVE AT YOUR PARTICULAR PLAIN MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THE FHALMUS HAS THE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ENTRY POINTS SO ITS CENSORY INFORMATION COMING IN FROM A BUNCH OF DFFERENT SOURCES AND THOSE SOURCES GET ROUDED INTO PROGRESSIVELY NARROWER AND NARROWER FUNNELS TO EVENTUALLY ARRIVE AT THE ACCURATE PLACE FOR THEIR FUNCTION SO THESE INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE GANGLY SELLS SEND CONNECTIONS TO A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT AREA OF THE PHALMUS CALLED ELPEDS DENOTED L THE LETTER AND P WITH LATTEROPOSTERIO THALMUS WOR THE I SHOULD SAY IT'S THE LATERAL POSTERIAL NUCLEUS OF THE THALMAS FOR YOU IF ASINATOS OUT THERE AND THEN THE NURONS IN THAT LOCATION ARE GOING TO RESPOND THAT IS THEIRE GOING TO BE ACTIVATED BY BRIGHT BLUE LIGHT GREEN LIGHT OR ANY KIND OF BRIGHT LIGHT ORIGINATING FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES OR FROM SUNLIGHT AND THE NURONS THERE THAT RESPOND TO THAT HAVE A VERY INTERESTING PATTERN OF CONNECTIONS THEY SEND CONNECTIONS UP TO THE SO CALED CENSORY QUARTEX SO A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT LAYERS THROUGHOUT THE QUARTEC THAT ARE NOT ASSOCIATE WITH VISUAL PERCEPTION THAT IS THEI'RE NOT ASSOCIATE WITH UNDERSTANDING THAT THER ARE SHAPES AND CONTOURS IN THE ENVIRONMENT BUT RATHER TO NURONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE DETECTION OF PRESSURE PAIN AND OTHER FORMS OF CENSORY INFORMATION AT THE LEVEL OF WHAT THE MANINGIES WE TALK FO THE MANINGIES EARLIER SO AGAIN WHILE THE BRAIN ITSELF DOES NOT HAVE A CENSORY A SYSTEM TO DETECT PAIN THE TISSUES AROUND IT DU AND THE TISSUES AROUND THOSE TISSUES THAT IS THE STUFF AROUND THE MANINGIS THEMSELVES CAN RESPOND O PAIN AND INTROCRANIAL PRESSURE IS ALSO RELAID THROUGH THE MANINGIES TO ARE CONSCIOUS AWARENESS THAT THERE'S PAIN SO WHAT IS THIS MEAN FORPHOTOPHOBIA IT MEANS THAT BRIGHT BLUE LIGHT AND GREEN LIGHT AND OF COURSE LIGHT FROM SUNLIGHT WILL ACTIVATE THE ESE NURONS IN THE EYE THESE INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE GANGLING CELLS WHICH THEN ACTIVATE THE LATTERALPOSTERIOR NURONS ELPENERONS AND THOSE ELPINERNS COMMUNICATE WITH AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY TUNE TO DIFFERENT CENSORY PHENOMENON AND IN PARTICULAR PAIN AT THE LEVEL OF THE MANINGIES AND INTROCRANIAL PRESSURE WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE HEADACHE OR IF WE SIMPLY HAVE PHOTOPHOBIA ON ITS OWN THAT BRIGHT LIGHT IS ACTUALLY THE TRIGGER FOR PAIN SENSING AND EVEN THE CREATION OF PAIN AT THE LEVEL OF THE N INGIES AND INTRCRANIAL PRESSURE WHAT IS THIS MEAN IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH OR TREATING PHOTOPHOBIA WHILE MOST PEOPLE DEAL WITH PHOTOPHOBA BY DECIDING TO TURN OFF OR DIM ALL THE LIGHTS AND SIMPLY GETTING UNDER THE COVERERS OR WORRING A VERY A LOW BRIMED HAT AND PUTTING ON SUNGLASSES IN THE THEY WANT TO LIE DOWN A SOMETIMES BECAUS A MIGRING CAN BE ASSOCIATE WULH NAUGIA OR EVEN BOMITING IN ITS SEPERICATE A INSTANCES RATHER BUT ONE VERY SIMPLE WAY TO AVOID ACTIVATION OF THESE RETINA GANGLIN CELLS THAT WOULD TRIGGER PHOTOPHOBIA IS THAT IF YOU ARE STARTING TO FEEL IK YOU HAVE A MIGRAN COMING ON OR YOU HAVE PHOTOPHOBIA COMING ON TO SHIFT TO USING PATTERNS OF LIGHT THAT ARE IN THE LONGER WAVE LENGTH DOMAIN WHAT THAT MEANS PRACTICALLY IS SHIFTING TO USING VERY ORANGE IDEALLY DIM BUT VERY ORANGE AN RED LIGHT NOW THIS IS NOT A CALL FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND INVEST IN EXPENSIVE RED LIGHT THERAPIES A ADMITTEDLY THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT CASE USES FOR RED LIGHT THEROPE PARTICULAR FOR ACHNEY WOUND HEALING EVEN FOR IMPROVING VISION ESPECIALLY IN PEOPLE BE ON THE AGE OF PORTY FOR SOME FORMON AUGMENTATION WE TALKED ALL ABOUT THAT IN TE EPISODE THAT I DID ON LIGHT AN HEALTH AGAIN YOU CAN FIND THAT AT HUBERMEN LAVDOT CALM EVERYTHING TIME STAMPED WHAT I'M TALKING MIGHT HERE WOULD BE SIMPLY HAVING SOME RED LIGHT BULBS ON HAND FOR ANY TIME THAT YOU NEED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT YOU'RE STARTING TO EXPERIENCE PHOTOPHOBIA THESE RED LIGHT BULBS CAN BE PURCHASE VERY INEXPENSIVELY A YOU KNOW AS PARTY LIGHTS YOU CAN BUY THESE ON LINE SO THERE IS NO SPECIFIC NEED TO GET ANY A I WOULD SAY A RED LIGHT THAT'S DESIGN SPECIFICALLY FOR PHOTOPHOBIA OR ANYTHING THAT SODE YOU CAN FIND THE CHEAPEST OF RED LIGHT AVAILABLE OUT THERE AND THOSE WILL SIMPLY WORK  THE IDEA BEING THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING PHOOPHOBIA THEY WANT A REDUCE THAT FEELING OF PAIN AND PRESSURE IN THEIR HEAD TH EXPERIENCE THROUGH PHOTOPHOBIA THEY ALSO MIGHT WANT O STAY AWAKE AT SOME WORKED ON IN DO THINGS SO OPERATING UNDER RED LIGHT OR I SHOULD SAY LIVING WORKING AT CETERA UNDER RED LIGHT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO STAY AWAKE NOT HAFE TO HIDE UNDER THE COVERS IF YOUR EXPERIENCING PHOTOPHOBIA IN ADDITION AND I MENTION THIS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE BUT MANY PEOPLE FIND PHOTOPHOBIA TO BE A ENTRY POINT OR A TRIGGER TO HEADACHE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY STARE TO EXPERIENCE SOME OROF SOME ONSET OFPHO PHOOPHOBIA AND THEN THE PHOTOPHOBIA ITSELF LEADS TO THIS FEELING I MALAYS THAT THEN CONVERTS INTO HEADACHE AND SO WHILE THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF CLINICAL DATA ON THIS JUST YET AN EMERGING IDEA IN THE REALM OF HEADACHE TREATMENT THE IDEA THAT IF YOU CAN OFFSET SOME OF THE EARLY SIGNS YOU CAN OFFSET SOME OF THAT PHOTOPHOBIA AND ORA PERHAPS TO THE USE OF DIM RED LIGHTS OR RED LIGHTS AS I'VE DESCRIBED A MOMENT AGO THEN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A MIGRAIN OR OTHER TYPE OF HEADACHE ENTIRELY SO AGAIN NO NEED FOR EXPENSE OF RED LIGHTS BUT YOUN OU CAN FIND RED LIGHTS VERY EASILY ON LINE AND  SIMPLY RAHAVE THEM ON HAND O REPLACE THAT THE CURRENT LIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR NIGHT STAND OR IN OR WHATEVER ROOM YOU HAPPEN TO BE UN WITH THESE RED LIGHTS THESE RED LIGHTS ARE ALSO I SHOULD MENTION VERY USEFUL IN LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF CORTAS ALL ASTRESS HORMONE THAT I IS VERY HEALTHY FOR US TO RELEASE AT HIGH LEVELS EARLY IN THE DAY IN FACT VIEWING SUNLIGHT WILL INCREASE CORTIS ALL LEVELS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY WHAT AM ABOUT SAY IS RELEVANT TO PHOTOPHOBIA BUT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP QARTUS ALL LEVELS LOW IN THE EVENING AND AT NIGHT AND INDEED YOU DO AND IMPROVE THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP AND INDEDIOUR SLEEP OVER ALL REDUCING QUARTERS ALLOP AT EVENING TIME AN A NIGHT TIME IS EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL AND RED LIGHTS WILL HELP YOU WILL COMPLISH THAT I TALKED ABOUT THAT IN THE EPISODE ON LIGHT IN HEALTH SO THE POINT HERE IS THAT IF YOU SUFFER FROM PHOTOPHOBIA WITH OR WITHOUT OR A USING RED LIGHTS AND NOT SIMPLY DIMMING ORDINARY ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS OR FEELING THT YOUAVET TO TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS ENTIRELY IS GOING TO BE ONE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE ORE I SHOULD SAY VERY INEXPENSIVE IN SOME CASES BECAUSE THESE RED LIGHTS CAN BE FOUND VERY INEXPENSIVELY ON LINE WAY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES AT LEAST IN AN INDOR ENVIRONMENT IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM PHOTOPHOBIA SO SHIFTING BACK TO WAYS TO REDUCE THE INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF HEADACHES WE HAVEN'T TALK SO MUCH ABOUT TENSION HEADACHES SPECIFICALLY SO THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO DO NOW AS YOU RECALL TENSION HEADACHES ARE GOING TO BE MUSCULAR IN ORIGIN CAN KEEPING IN MIND THAT EVERYTHINGS NORL WHEN IT COMES TO PAIN ITHINGS NOR WHEN IT COMES TO EVERYTHING FRANKLY CAUSE EVERY ORGAN AND TISSUE SYSTEM IN OUR BODY IS ULTIMATELY CONTROL BY OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT TENSION HEADACHES ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH TENSION OF THE MUSCLES THAT ARE ON THE SKULL OF THE JAW OF THE NECK AND CAN BE QUITE PAINFUL FOR MANY PEOPLE AN DEBILITATING AND THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT FOR THIS THAT MOST PEOPLE RELY ON THAT IS IS TO TAKE NONSTEROID ANTIINFLAMMATORYE SO THINGS LIKE A SEET OF BENEFIN I BE PROPHIN SOMETIMES ASPERN IN THINGS OF THAT SORT AND OFTENTIMES THOSE CAN BE HELPFUL THEIR COUPLE THINGS KEEP IN MINE HOWEVER THE ENDSADS NONSTERIDANTAND FLAMMATORY DRUGS OFTENTIMES WILL WORK VERY WELL AT FIRST BUT PEOPLE QUICKLY DEVELOP A TOLERANCE TO THEM MEANING THE'RE CAN HAVE TO TAKE MORE AND MORE AND ORDER TO GET THE SAME A FACT AND OFTENTIMES THEY CAN'T TAKE MORE AND MORE BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE VERY HARD ON THE LIVER AND IN ADDITION TO THAT SOME OF THEM CAN OFFSET SOME OTHER THINGS THAT YOU REALLY WANT SO FOR INSTANCE IT'S NOW KNOWN THAT NONSTEROD INTO INFLAMMATORY DRUGS CAN OFFSET SOMEOF THE BENEFITS OF EXERCISE THAND THEMIC SENSE BECAUSE THA LOT OF THE ADAPTED BENEFITS OF EXERCISE ACTUALL COME FROM EXPERIENCING A LOT OF INFLAMMATION ACUTELY THAT MEANS YOU ACTUALL WANT INFLAMMATION DURING YOUR RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUT OR EVEN YOUR ENDURANCE WORK OUT BUT THEN THAT INFLAMMATION TRIGGERS AN ADAPTATION EVENT OR SERIES OF ADAPTATION EVENTS THAT LEADS TO GREATER STRENGTH GREATER SPEED MORE MUSCLE MORE ENDURANCE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE TRAINING FOR SO REDUCING PAIN CAN BE GOOD OF COURSE BUT NOT IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE MORE AND MORE OF A GIVEN DRUG THAT IT HAS SIDE EFFECTS ON THE LIVER AND CAN OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE AND SO FORTH THE OTHER REISSUE WITH NONSTEROID INTINFLAMATORY DRUGS IS THAT MANY OF THEM SIMPLY DO NOT WORK FOR MANY PEOPLE OR AGAIN THEY'LL WORK THE FIRST TIME IN THE SECOND TIME BUT THAN THEY STOP WORKING THEY ALL SUTTEND TO LOWER BODY TEMPERATURE I THINK O MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THIS OM BECAUSE MANY OF THESE SAME A DRUGS ARE USED IN ORDER TO REDUCE FEVE ER BUT IF YOU ARE TAKING NONSTERIDANTI IN FLAMMATORY DRUGS SIMPLY TO REDUCE YOUR HEADACHE AND YOUR LOWING CORBODY TEMPERATURE THAT CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF DOWNSTREAM ISSUES RELATES TO SLEEP WAKE CYCLES TO METABOLISM TO A MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION MORE GENERALLY AND ON AND ON FOR THAT REASON HAS BEEN A QUITE A LOT OF EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVES TO NONSTERIDANTI IN FLAMMATORY DRUGS FORE THE TREATMENT OF HEADACHE AND INDEED PAIN GENERALLY BUT TO DAY WERE TALKING ABOUT HEADACHE NOW AS IT RELATES TO TENTION HEADACHE ONE OF THEM MORE ADVANCED A AN A MODERN TREATMENTS THAT YOU SOMETIMES HEREABOUT IS BOTOCS I BOTOC I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH AS THE THING THAT PEOPLE GET INJECTED INTO THEIR FACE AROUND THE EYES OR ROUND THE LIPS OR ELSEWHERE IN ORDER TO QUOTIE REDUCE WRINKLES IT WAS DISCOVERED SOME YEARS AGO WHEN BOTOX TREATMENTS WERE BEING DONE FOR COSMETIC REASONS THAT IT COULD OFTEN BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR RELIEVING HEADACHE IF INJECTED INTO THE MUSCLES AND THE WAY THAT A IT WORKS IS THAT OF COURSE TENSION HEADACHE INVOLVES A TENSION OF THE MUSCLES AA A CAN OFA WILL CALL IT CLINCHING ARE SINCHING UP OF THE MUSCLES BUT WERE REALLY TOCKING BOUT AS CONTRACTION OF TH MUSCLES AND THAT'S CONTROLLED BY NURONS NERONS WHICH ARE NERRO MUSCULAR SO NERO MUSCULAR NERONS IT DON'T FORM SCYNAPSES WITH OR CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER NEURONS THEY FORM SENAPS IS WITH MUSCLE THEY RELEASE A SEETILCOLING ON TO THE MUSCLE THAT MAKES THE MUSCLE CONTRACT THIS IS THE WAY YOU MOVE THE LIMBS OF YOUR BODY IS ALSO WAY THE MUSCLES OF YOUR A HEAD CONTRACT AND CAN GIVE YOU TENSION TYPE HEADACHES BOTOCS ARISES FROM OR IS RATHER BOCHELINUM NERROTOXS AND BOCHELINUM NEROTOXIN IS A TOXON THAT'S FOUND IN CANNED GOODS NOT ALL CAN GOODS OF COURSE AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT IT PREVENTS A CERTAIN STEP IN THE RELEASE OF SO CALLED NERO TRANSMITTER IN THE LITTLE PACKETS THAT THEY LIVE IN WHICH ARE CALED VESSICLES LITTLE LITTLE SPHERES OF NORTRANSMENTER LIVE AT THE END OF NERON NERVE TERMINALS AND ARE RELEASED ON TO THE MUSCLE MAKE THE MUSCLE CONTRACT BOCHELINUM NEUROTOCXIN CLEAVES OF PARTICULAR PROTINE IN THERE FOR YOU I F FASUNOT AS ONE A L THE SOPITS OF REALLY COOL MECHANISM IT CLEAVES SOMETHING ALL SNAP TWENTY FIVE A SNAP TWENTY FIVE IS INVOLVED IN THE FUSION OF THOSE LITTLE SPHERES WITH THE MEMBRANE OF THE NERON AND RELEASING OF THE NERRO TRANSMITTER SO WHEN BOCHELINUM NEROTOXIN IS PRESENT AT THNERVE MUSCLE INTERFACE THOSE NERVES CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH THE MUSCLE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE MUSCLES UNDERGO KIND OF FLACID A TONE THEY JUST KIND OF RELAX THERE UNDERNEATH THE SKIN SURE WRINKLES ARE RELIEVED BUT IF BOTOC IS INJECTED INTO THE MUSCLES THEMSELVES IT CAN PROVIDE LONG LASTING RELIEF OF CERTAIN TYPES OF HEADACHES IN PARTICULAR TENSION TYPE HEADACHES SO WHILE IT SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF AN EXTREME TREATMENT PEOPLE WHO SUFFER VERY BADLY FROM TENSION TYPE HEADACHES DUE TO HYPER CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FOREHEAD OR AROUND THE TEMPLES OR ROUND THE JAWS ORE THE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE THE NECK IN THE MUSS MUSCLES OF THE NECK THAT ENCROACH ON THE ON THE BACK OF THE SKULL OR THAT ACTUALLY CONNECT TO THE BACK OF THE SKULL CAN ACHIEVE TREMENDO S LONGLASTING RELIEF FROM THESE BOTOCS INJECTION SOMETIMES FOR WEEKS OR MONSTER EVEN LONGER PEOPLEL GO IN FOR PERIODICH A A YOU KNOW REOPS OF BOTOCKS UM IT ACTUALLY IS QUITE SAFE DESPITE THE FACTE THAT BOCHELINUMNEROTOCS AND IS QUITE DANGEROUS A IT'S GIVEN IN VERY LODOSISM GIVEN LOCALLY SO THOSE OF THE ONLY MUSCLES AFFECTED SO TAT'S HOW BOTOCKS IS USED TO TREAT A HEADACHES AN UM IS O VERY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AT THAT OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE I IMAGIN ARE INTERESTED IN NOTCHOUS DRUG BASE TREATMENTS AND NOT BOTOCKS TYPE TREATMENTS FOR TREATING HEADACHE BUT OTHER TYPES OF TREATMENTS FOR HEADACHE THAT ARE OF THE MORE LET'S CALL THEM NATURAL OR UM NONDRUG TREATMENTS AND HERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THE REALM OF THE AND OF HERBAL AND OIL BASE TREATMENTS FOR HEADACHE NOW I CONFESS WHEN I FIRST STACTED RESEARCHING THIS AREA OF HEADACHE AND TREATMENT FOR EADACHES THAD IS M I FOUND MYSELF APPROACHING IT WITH A BIT OF TREPIDATION BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED TO HEAR ABOUT ESSENTIAL OILS AND ABOUT HERBAL MEDICATIONS AND  THINGS OF THAT SORT I THOUGHT OKE WELL THOUH PROBABLY BE SOME OF FACTS I MEAN ADMITTEDLY WE'VE TALK BEFORE IR ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THINGS LIKE APIGENIN APIGENIN IS  ONE OF THE A COUR COMPONENTS OF CAMOMILE AND CEMEMILE IS KNOWN TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LOBIT SLEEPY AND CAN ENHANCE SLEEP WELL APGENIN AND HIGH CONCENTRATION CAN INDEED AUGMENT SLEEP WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN ARE SLEEP TOOL KIT BY THE WAY WE DON'T JUST HAVE EPISODES ABOUT SLEEP MASTER SLEEP PERFECT OUR SLEEP ET CETERA BUT IF YOU GO TO THE HUBERMAN LABDOCK COMWEBSIDE AND YOU GO TO THE MAN UN YOU CLICK ON NEWS LETTER CAN SCROLL DOWN YOU'LL SEE THAT WE HAVE A TOOL KIT FOR SLEEP THIS COMPLETELY ZEROCOST TO ACTS ASSYOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SIGN UP ALTHOUGH IF YOU LIKE TO SIGN UP FOR FUTURE NEWS LETTERS YOU CAN GET THOSE ONE OF THE KEEP COMPONENTS OF THE TOOL KIP FOR SLEEPE IN ADDITION TO BEHAVIORAL TOOLS AND THINGS THAT ARE NOT SUPPLEMENT BASED IS APIGENIN WHICH IS THIS COMPONENT FROM A CAMOMILES SO THE IDEA THAT  CERTAIN HERBAL DERIVATIVES OR HERBS OR OILS COULD BE VERY USEFUL FOR IMPROVING SYMPTOMS OF WHATEVER IN THIS CASE IMPROVING SLEEP WITH APIGENAND IS NOT UNHEARD OF IT IN FACT THE DATA CONTINUE TO BE RELEASED ALL THE TIME THAT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK OF AS HERBAL AT CETERA CANNATTHALY HAVE QUITE POTENT OF FACTS AND SO UM WHILE I MYSELF IT WAS APPROACHING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT ESSENTIAL OILS AND A RISHES AY OILS RIGHT WHOS TO SAY IF THEYARE ESSENTIAL OR NOT OILS AND HERBS IN THE TREATMENT OF HEADACHE I FINISHED OUT MY RESEARCH ON THIS SLITERATURE FEELING UM QUITE I SHOULD SAY A  SURPRISED AN UM AND AS IF I NEED TO REALLY CHECK MYSELF A BIT BECAUSE WHAT I FOUND IS THAT THERE'RE CERTAIN HERBS AN OILS FOR INSTANCE THAT FAR OUT PERFORM NONSTERED AND ANTIINFLAMATORY DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEADACHE THAT'S RIGHT THERE 'RE CERTAIN OILS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OVER THE COUNTER THAT WHEN LOOKED AT IN MANY STUDIES METANALYSIES ANDILL ELL YUBOUT ONE PARTICULAR STUDY AND AMEN ANALSEES IN A MOMENT THEY SHOW THAT THEY CAN REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF HEADACHE IN A MANNER THAT FAR OUT PACES WHAT YOU OBSERVE ITH NONSTEROID ANTIME FLAMATORY DRUGS WITH APPARENTLY NONE OF THE SAME ISSUES ASSOCEY WITH NONSTEROD ANTINE FLAMETORY DRUGS SO AM I THINK IT'S REALLY WORTH PAYING ATTENTION TO THE FIRST OF THOSE STUDIES I LIKE TO DESCRIBE TOU IS A ONE THAT HIS NOW BECOME COND OF A CLASSIC IN THE LITERATURE I SHOULD SAY AT LEAST FOR THOSE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THE A A TYPICAL TREATMENTS FOR HEADACHE AND THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS EFFECT OF PEPPERMENT AND EUCALYPTUS OIL PREPARATIONS ON NERVE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALJUST METRIC HEADACHE PERAMETERS OK WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL THIS IS AN INTERESTING STUDY BECAUSE RATHER THAN LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PEPPERMAN AND EUCALYPTAS OIL AND OTHER OILS ON HEADACHE WHAT THEY DID IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING HEADACHE WHICH I CONFESS I LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY WON TO UNDERSTAND THE NEURALPHYSIOLOGY AND NOT JUST GET SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF HEADACHE ALTHOUGH THEY DID THAT TOO BUT HEY REALLY WON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THESE OILS CAN IMPACT THINGS LIKE MUSCULAR TENSION OR PERCEPTION OF PAIN WHAT THEY DID IS THEY RECREATED HEADACHE IN HUMAN SUBJECTS BY USING TIGHTENING CUFFS OF THE OF THE HEAD THEY CUT OFF BLOOD SUPPLY TO CERTAIN AREAS OF THE HEAD THEY BASILY INDUCED HEADACHE AND THEN THEY MEASURED THINGS LIKE THE E M G THE MUSCLE RESPONSE AT THE LEVEL OF ELECTRO PHYSIOLOGY IN THE MUSCLE AND OF COURSE SUBJECTIVE MEASURES OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE PERCEIVED TO BE IN PAIN OR NOT IN PAIN A I'LL GIVE YOU THE BROAD CONTROR OF THE STUDY BCAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE CONCLUSIONS THAT COME THROUGH MOST CLEARLY AND WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDY IN ARE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS SO WHAT THEY DID IS THEY HAD PEOPLE USE ONE OF FOUR DIFFERENT PREPARATIONS SAID PREPARATION ONE WHICH INCLUDE SOME PEPPERMEN OIL AND SOME EUCALYPTUS OIL AND ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT THE AMOUNT AN THE RELATIVE PERCENTAGES ARE IN THE PAPER FOR YOU TO PRODUSE ON LINE THROUGH THE LINK I MENTION BEFORE SO THEY HAD FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS THEY HAD ONE GROUP APPLY PEPPERMEN OIL BUT THAT PEPPERMINOIL ALSO CONTAINED EUCALYPTAS SOIL THEYHAD ANOTHER GROUP USE JUST PEPPERMEN OIL THEAD ANOTHER GROUP USE JUST TINY TRACES OF PEPPERMIN OIL AND SMALLER DOSEES OF EUCALYPTUS OIL AND THEN THEY HAD A FOURTH GROUP WHICH WAS JUST USING PLOCIBO AND I SAY USING WHA THEY WERE DOING IS THEY WERE SPONGE APPLYING THE OIL TO THE TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD OF PEOPLE AND THEN WHAT THEY DID IS THEY USE THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO MEASURE THE ACTIVATION OF MUSCLES TO MEASURE PAIN AND THEY THEN INDUCED HEAD PAIN THEY INDUCED HEADACHE SO AND THEY LOOKED AT THE TEMPORAL MUSCLES ON THE SIDE THEY LOOKD AT FOREHEAD MUSCLES THINGS TOF THAT SORT SO THEY USE THREE DIFFENTYPES OF PAIN STIMULLY THEY LOOKED AT PEOPLE'S SENSITIVITY TO EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED PAIN BY EITHER PROVIDING PRESSURE SO THIS WAS KIND OF A CUFF AROUND THE FOREHEAD OR THERNMAL PAIN SO THEY ACTUALLY HAD THEM OBASILY HEAT HEATED UP AT THE LEVEL OF THE SKIN AM AND ACTUALLY A THEY BROUGHT THE HEAT UP PRETTY HIGH TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE WERE RATING THE PAIN ALMOST TO THE TO THE POINT OF A EXCESSIVE PAIN AND PAIN LIMIT SO  OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T TAKE THEM TO THE POINT OF EXTREME PAIN END THEY HAD A CONSTRICTION TYPE CONDITION IN WHICH THEY CUT OFF BLOOD CIRCULATION TO THE PERYCRANIAL MUSCLES USING AN INFLATABLE COLLAR AROUND THE CRANIUM AND THEY INFLATED THAT TO PRETTY HIGH PRESSURE SO CAN HAVE A BRUTAL EM  EXPEREMENT TO BE INVOLVED IN BUT LOOK THER THYNOMIMIC HEADACHE AND I THINK AM BY USING THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES THERE ABLE TO MIMIC THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HEADACHE AND MAKE SURE AND HEARES THE KEY POINT THAT EVERY PERSON IN THE STUDY IS NOT JUST GETTING THE SAME TREATMENT FOR HEADACHE BUT IS GETTING THE SAME HEADACHE AND THAT SOMETHING THAT I THINK GIVES THIS STUDY POWER IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO DO A STUDY LIKE THIS BUT IT GIVES IT A LOT OF POWER IN TRYIND UNDERSTAND WHICH TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS ARE GOING TO ASSIST IN HEADACHE AND MAY BE VEN SPECIFIC DIMENSIONS OF THE PAIN AND HEADACHE AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY FOUND IN THE STUDY IS THAT OF ALL THE TREATMENTS THEY USED THE ESSENTIAL PLAN OIL PREPARATIONS THAT CONTAINED PEPPERMENT AND I'LL JUST MENTION AS AN ASSIDE AND IN OTHER STUDIES MEN FALL SO THESE MINTY TYPE A ESSENTIAL MINTY TYPE A WHAT WE THINK OF HIS FLAVORS BUT ARE REALLY AROMAS AS WELL AND AS A'LL POINT OUT THE MECHANISM IN A MOMENT THEY HAD THE EFFECT OF SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE INTENSITY OF THE PAIN THAT IS SUBJECTS COULD TOLERATE THE PAIN FAR BETTER AND EXPERIENCED LESS PAIN SUBJECTIVELY AND THE MAGNITUDE O THE EFFECTS WERE REALLY PRETTY IMPRESSIVE AGAIN I WENT INTO ALL THIS THINKING ESSENTIAL OILS OKE THAT'S LIKE THEM REALLY WOO STUFF AM NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE ESSENTIAL OILS AT LEAST THE ONES THAT CONTAIN PEPPERMEN OIL WITH OR WITHOUT EUCALYPTUS OIL PERFORMD VERY WELL IN REDUCING PAIN THE KEY TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY IS AND HERE ON PERAPHRASING FROM THE STUDY THAT THE COMMINATION OF PEPPERMEN OIL EUCALYPTO SOIL AND THESE AR BASICALLY IN A EFINAL SUSPENSION AGAIN PEOPLE ARE NOT DRINKING THESE ESSENTIAL OILS I ONE TO BE VERY CLEAR THEY ARE APPLYING THESE TO THE TO THE SKIN AROUND THE AREA THAT'S IN PAIN IN PARTICULAR THE TEMPLE IN THE FOREHEADS INCREASED COGNIVE PERFORMANCE I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THIS IS THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN COGNIVE FUNCTIONING WALL IN PAIN YOU NOT HERE RETIMUMA HEADACHE UP UNTIL NOW JUST AS I'M CIND OF PAIN BUT THAT PAIN CAN BE VERY DEBILITATING FOR YOURABILITY TO WORK AND PERFORM AND TO OTHER THINGS SO THIS COMMONATION AF PEPERMINOIL N EUCALYPTUS OIL APPLIED TO THE SKIN ALLOWD PEOPLE TO INCREASE THEIR COGNIVE PERFORMANCE WHILE UNDER PAIN AND HAD A VERY MUSCLE RELAXING AND MENTALLY RELAXING EFFECT MENTAL RELAXATION WAS OF COURSE MEASURED SUBJECTIVELY BUT REMEMBER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT LED ME TO FEATURE THIS STUDY IN THIS EPISODE IN PARTICULAR IS THAT THEY DIDN'T O SAY O MY MUSCLES FEEL MORE RELAX THEY ACTUALLY SAW THAT THE MUSCLES OF THE FOREHEAD AND TEMPLES AND  SOME SURROUNDING MUSCLES WERE MORE RELAXED WHEN PEOPLE HAD THESE OILS ON APPLIED TO THEIR FOREHEAD AND THE TEMPLES NOT PERHAPS TO THE SAME DEGREE THAT ONE WOULD OBSERVE WITH BOTOCKS OR FOR THE SAME EXTENT OR DURATION AS ONE WOULD EXPERIECE WITH BOTOCS BUT MUCH IN THE SAME WAY WHICH THEN RAISES THE QUESTION WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IMAN IS A SALPLOCIBOFECT WILL KNOW BECAUSE THEY COMPARED TO PLUOCIBO AND THEY CONTROLLED FOR THE ODOR OF COURSE OF THE OIL THAT WAS APPLIED SO THAT EVERY ONE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE GETTING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING PON INTENDED BUT IN THIS CASE WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT IF THEY APPLIED THE ESSENTIAL OIL TO THE FOREHEAD AND TEMPLES THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE MORER LESS A COOLING SENSATION OR THEY COULD FEEL AS IF SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING IN TE UNDERLYING MUSCLE WELL WHAT WAS HAPPENING WE NOW KNOW THAT MENTHALL PEPPERMENT AND OTHER THINGS THAT SMELL THAT WAY AND TASTES THAT WAY ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE SENSORY NURONS AT THE LEVEL OF THE SKIN AND CAN ACTUALLY INHIBIT CERTAIN SCENSORY NURONS AND CAN ACTIVATE OTHER CENSORY NURONS OKAY SO IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS WE HAVE TO GO BACT WHAT I SAID THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE MOTOR NERON ZHESE ARE NURONS THAT CONSTRICT MUSCLES OR SCUSE ME THAT CAUSE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLES IY DON'T CONSTRICT THEM THEY CAUSE CONTRACTION MUSCLES YOU HAVE SENSORY NURONS WHICH SENSE DIFFERENT THINGS LIGHT SOUND OR TOUCH AND YOU HAVE MODULATORY NURONS MENTHALL AND EUCALYPTUS ARE ACTUALLY KNOWN TO ACTIVATE CERTAIN CHANNELS IN THE SENSORY NURONS THAT RESPOND NOT JUST TO TOUCH BUT ALSO THE SENSATION OF COOLING O CASESO WHEN WE THINK OF MENTALL AND PEPPERMEN WE THINK OF AN OF COOL SENSE AND FLAVORS COOL MEANING COLD AND WHEN WE THINK OF THINGS LIKE HOT PEPPERS CAPSASIN WE THINK OF NOT ANYTHING THAT HAS A HOT TEMPERATURE WE TEND TO THINK OF SPICY SO SPICY AND HOT GO TOGETHER AND PEPPERMENT AND MENTHALL AND COOL GO TOGETHER MUCH IN THE WAY THAT THE ON GUM COMMERCIALS OF THE MINCOMCOMMERCIALS WOULD LEAD YOU BELIEVE IN IN FACT THEIRE RIGHT SO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE OILS IS VERY LIKELY ACTIVATING CHANNELS IN THE SENSORY NURONS INCLUDING THE TRIP CHANNELS BUT OTHERS AS WELL THAT ARE LEADING TO THE ANAL GESES EFFECT BY SHUTTING DOWN THE HEAT AND PAIN PATHWAYS BECAUSE HEAT AND PAIN WHILE THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THEY ARE FUNNELED THROUGH COMMON PATHWAYS WERE HAS COOLING AND PAIN RELIEF ARE FUNNELED THROUGH ALTERNATE WHAT WE CALL PARALLEL PATHWAYS SO THI STUDY ON PEPERMAN AND EUCALYPTUS OIL PREPARATIONS IN REDUCING PAIN OF HEADACHE AND DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF PAIN DO TO HEADACHE I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DON'T JUST ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THAT YES INDEED I'L GO ON RECORD SAYING IT CAUSE TAT'S WHAT THE DAY TO SAY AND ON THERE ARE OTHER PAPERS TO SUPPORT THE STATEMENT AS WELL ESSENTIAL OILS APPLYD TO THE SKIN CAN REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS OF TENSION HEADACHE IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY AND ACTUALLY CAN LEAD TO SOME ON OFFSET OF SOME OF THE COGNITIVE A DEFECTS SEEN WITH HEADACHES SO THAT ITSELF VERY IMPRESSIVE I MUST SAY SURPRISING FOR ME ON OV PUT ME IN MY PLACE AS SOMEBODY THOUGHT OF ESSENSIAL OILS ASWEN WE LIKE ON'TKI BUT IS ACTUALLY SEEM TO UNREALLY HOLD SOME MERIT AND WHEN YOU COMPARE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECT EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS AN ENORMOUS A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS YOU COMPARE THE MAGNETO THE EFFECT IN A PAPER LIKE THIS OR SIMILAR PAPERS ON THESE ESSENTIAL OILS TO THE IMPACT OF NONSTEROD ANTI NFLAMETORY DRUGS AND THEY REALLY HOLD THEIR OWN AND IN SOME CASES EXCEED THE POUSIVE IN PACT OF ANTION FLAMATORY DRUGS SO FOR THAT REASON I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT PEPPERMIN OILS AND PEPPERMEN UCALYPTUS CONTAINING OILS MENTHAL CONTAINING OILS APPLIED TO THE SKIN FOR THE TREATMENT OF TENSION TYPE HEADACHE AS AAMONG THE MORE POTENT TREATMENTS AVAILABLE OUT THERE NOW ANOTHER WAY TO APPROACH TREATMENT OF TENSION HEADACHE IS SOMETHING THAT MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT BEFORE AND THAT I'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ON THIS PODCAST AND PREVIOUS EPISODES AND THAT'S ACUPUNCTURE WE WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT ACUPUNCTURE BUT MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT ESENTIAL OILS I THINK FOR MANY PEOPLE NOT ALL BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERED KIND OF A WO BIOLOGY OR PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS VERY ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE KEEP IN MIND THAT AS THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF THINGS LIKE THESE PEPPERMIN OILS ARE STARTING TO BE DISCOVERED OR AMEGA THREES ARE STRYING TO BE DISCOVERED MECHANISTICALLY THEY HOLD UP VERY WELL THERE'S A LOGIC THERE THERE'S AN UNDERLYING UNDERSTANDING OF NOT JUST WHY THEY SHOULD WORK BUT IN MANY CASES HOW THEY WORK IN THE SAME WAY ACUPUNCTURE WHICH OF COURSE HAS EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAS BEEN USED VERY SUCCESSFULLY TO TREAT HEADACHE AND OTHER FORMS OF PAIN SO MUCH SO THAT MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL NOW PAY FOR ACUPUNCTURE AS AN INSURED PRACTICE NOT ALL BUT MANY WILL AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IS STARTING TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISTICALLY HOW ACUPUNCTURE WORK SO I DON'T WAN TO MAKE THIS O THE MAJOR FOCUS FOR NOW BUT VERY BRIEFLY THERE'S A LABORATORY AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL RUN BY CHUFUMA CHUFU IS WELL KNOWN IN THE NAROL SCIENCE COMMUNITY FOR DOING EXCELLENT WORK IN PARSING THE MECHANISMS OF TOUCH SENSATION AND PAIN IN PARTICULAR SO NOT JUST TOUCH AT THE LEVEL OF SKIN BUT PAIN AND PAIN PATHWAYS AND IN RECENT YEARS HIS LABORATORY HAS STARTED TO DO STUDIES ON HOW ACUPUNCTURE WORKS BECAUSE INDEED ACUPUNCTURE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO WORK TO ALLEVIATE PAIN FOR A LONG TIME BUT T UNDERLYING MECHANISMS HAVENT BEEN CLEAR WHAT CHUFU'S LAB HAS PUBLISHED NOW IN EXCELLENT JOURNALS LIKE NATURE UM SCIENCE AND OTHER JOURNALS IS THAT THE PRECISE INSERTION SITES OF DIFFERENT NEEDLES LEAD TO ACTIVATION OF CENSORY NURONS AND THEIR DOWNSTREAM PATHWAYS IN WAYS THAT CAN POTENTLY REDUCE IN FLAMMATION AND THAT CAN BE USED TO POTENTLY REDUCE THE ACTIVITY OF CERTAIN MUSCLES FOR INSTANCE MUSCLES IN THE FOREHEAD AND TEMPLES SO WHEN YOU HER ACUPUNCTURE CAN REDUCE PAIN I THINK SOME PEOPLE THIY O WHILE THERE'S NEEDLES STICKING OUT OF YOUR FACE FOR S WALL THAT MUST HURT N AN ACTUALLY THAT NEEDLES ARE VERY FINE NEEDLES AND SKILLED ACUPUNCTUROUS CAN INSERT THEM WITHOUT ANY PAIN OR ACTUALLY THE PERSON RECEIVING IT DOESN'T EVEN USUALLY RECOGNIZE HAT THE NEEDLES ARE IN THAT'S HOW QUICKLY IN U EFFICIENTLY THEY CAN PUT THEM IN AND PEOPLE DON'T DETECT ANY PAIN BUT THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO GREATLY REDUCE PAIN IN PARTICULAR HEADACHE RELATED PAIN AND BAC RILY TO PAINN SOME OTHER FORMS OF PAIN CHUFU'S LAB HAS SHOWN THAT THE SPECIFIC NEEDLE INSERTION SITES CAN ACTIVATE THE CENSORY PATHWAYS AND CAN DEACTIVATE THE CENSORY MOTOR PATHWAYS AND NOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH CENSURYNERONS MOTOR NOW SON MODULATORY RUNS AND CAN MODULATE THE ACTIVITY OF THE PAIN PATHWAYS BY WAY OF IMPACTING THE ACTIVITY OF ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT ORGANS INCLUDING ORGANS THAT GIVE RISE TO SOME OF THE INFLAMMATORY SIDEOF KIND SO BASILY WHAT IM SAYING HERE IS THAT THANKS TO THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF ACUPUNCTURE AND THE MAPS OF DIFFERENT INSERTION SITES WE NOW KNOW OR I SHOULD SAY PEOPLE HAVE LONG KNOWN AND PEOPLE IN THE WEST ARE STARTING TO ADOPT THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ACUPUNCTURE YES INDEED IT REALLY DOES WORK FOR RELIEVING PAIN AND LABORATORIES BOTH IN UNITED STATES JUST THUFUS AND ELSEWHERE ARE STARTING TO FIND THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AND THOSE MECHANISMS INCLUDE DEACTIVATION OF THE PAIN PATHWAYS ACTIVATION OF SOME OF THE PARALLEL PATHWAYS THAT ASSIST IN SHUTTING DOWN PAN OR IN RELAXING THE MUSCLES THAT ARE CAUSING TENSION TYPE HEADACHE AS WELL AS ACTIVATION OF NURL PATHWAYS THAT IN PINGE ON ORGANS THAT THEN CAUSE OR REDUCE THE RELEASE OF MOLECULES INTO THE BODY THEY GIVE US THE EXPERIENCE OF PAINS O REDUCED INFLAMMATION AND IN MANY CASES INCREASING ANTI AN FLAMMATORY PATHWAYS SO I JUST WANT TO BE SURE TO MENSION ACUPUNCTURE AND A LITTLE BIT OF MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF WYACUPUNCTURE WORKS BECAUSE INDEED ACUPUNCTURE IS SHOWN TO BE QUITE EFFECTIVE FOR THE TREATMENT OF TENSION TYPE HEADACHE AND TO SOME EXTENT MIGRAIN HEADACHE AS WELL SO WE TALKED ABOUT OMAGA THREE FATIACIDS WE TALKED ABOUT ESSENTIAL OILS WE TALKD ABOUT ACUPUNCTURE SO THIS EPISODE IS STARTING TO SOUND LIKE ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS TO HEADACHE INCLUDING MIGRAIN BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT ABOUT ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS EVERYTHING THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE HAS A MECHANISTIC BASIS AND WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY ARE APPROACHES TO DEALING WITH HEADACHE THAT YES ARE TYPICALLY OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUNDS OR ARE GROUNDED IN NUTRITION OR IN THE CASE OF ACUPUNCTURE BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES BUT THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY MEANT AS REPLACEMENTS FOR THINGS LIKE NONSTEROID ANTAINFLAMMATORY DRUGS OR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OF COURSE THOSE THINGS CAN STILL BE TAKEN MANY PEOPLE DRIVE BENEFIT FROM THEM BUT THE GOAL IS ALWAYS I BELIEVE I SHOULD HOPE FOR PEOPLE TO FINE WAYS THAT THEY CAN CONTROL THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCE THINGS LIKE HEADACHE USING A MINIMUM NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE OTHER SIDE EFFECTS AND THAT OF COURSE CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE USE OF ESSENTIAL OILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THINGS LIKE NONSTEROID ANTIN FLAMMATORY DRGS OR TE USE OF RED LIGHT TO OFFSET PHOTOPHOBIA IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TREATMENTS EITHER PRESCRIPTION OR OTHERWISE S I DO WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AND I SPECIALY WHN TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AS I TRANSITION TO THE NEXT SEGMENT WHERE I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT ERBAL TREATMENTS FOR MIGRAIN AND THIS IS BASED ON WHAT I CONSIDER A VERY COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF MANY RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDIES INDEED THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS ERBLE TREATMENTS FOR MIGRAIN A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDIES AND THIS WAS PUBLISH IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS CONTAINS AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION SO WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO IT AFTER THOSE WHO THAT REALLY WANT TO DIVE DEEP ON THIS IN TH S PAPER THEY FOCUS ON A NUMBER DIFFERENT REVIEWS AND ANALYSIES OF DATA FOCUSED ON COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF MIGRANE RANGING FROM AND INCLUDING THINGS LIKE MENTHAUL AND PEPPERMENT OIL WE ALL RECOVERED THAT SO I WON'T COVER THAT AGAIN IN DETAIL BUT IN THIS A REVIEW THE HIHLIGHT THE RESULTS I REFER TO BEFORE PLUS OTHER RESULTS THAT SHOW THAT MENTHAL AND PEPPERMEN OIL CAN BE QUITE EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF TENTION TYPE HEADACHE AND IN THIS CASE MIGRANE HEADACHE AS WELL SO THAT'S INTERESTING THAT MENTHALLN PEPPERMANOILS CAN BE USED NOTJUST A TREAT TENTION TYPE HEADACHE BUT MIGRANE HEADACHES AS WELL AND THEY LOOK AT AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF OTHER TYPES OF ERBAL AND ESSENTIAL OIL TYPE TREATMENTS EVERYTHING FROM CORIANDER TO CITRON TO DAMASK ROS KAMAMEA LAVENDER A PUNCH OF THINGS SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THESE IN A LOT OF DETAIL AVE TENDED TO DO TO DAY AND I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS TO HYLATE THE MOST POTENT OF THESE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS AGAIN MENTHALL PEPPERMANOIL BEING AMONG THE MOST POTENT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR PATHWAY THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH HEADACHE AND WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHE WHICH INCLUDES THE ACTIVATION OF THIS THING THAT WE CALL C G R P C G AR P AGAIN IS INVOLVED IN THIS KALCIUM REGULATION PATHWAY AND LEADS TO AZO DILATION OF THE VESSELS AND ARTERIES AND KAPLARIES IN A WAY THAT CAN CREATE PAIN AND THIS FEELING OF PRESSURE INSIDE THE HEAD WHICH CAN BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE OF COURSE NOW EARLIER IN THE EPISODE I MENTION THAT I WAS GOING TO TOUCH ON KAFFINE ENCI'M GOING TO DO THAT NOW NOW THE REASON I MENTION KAFFINE IS THAT THERE'S A A SORT OF LOER OUT THERE THAT IF YOU HAVE A HEADACHE DRINKING A CUP OF COFFEE CAN ELIMINATE THAT HEADACHE A FEW THINGS ABOUT THAT POINT FIRST OF ALL IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IN JESTS KAFFINE EVERY DAY AND YOU DO NOT IN JEST KAFFINE YOU WILL INDEED GET A HEADACHE AND DRINKING KAFFINE WILL RELIEVE THAT PARTICULAR HEADACHE SO IT'S ABSOBLY TRUE THAT KAFFINE CAN RELIEVE THE LACK OF KAFFINE INDUCED HEADACHE THAT SORT OF A DAE BUT O THAT LEADS ACTUALLY TO A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS WHY WOULD THAT BE THE CASE WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT AFFINE IS BOTH A VAZO DILATOR AND A VAZO CONSTRICTOR HOW DOES IT DO THAT WELL ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS IN WHICH KAFFINE MAKES US MORE ALERT IS THAT IT OCCUPIES THE RECEPTERS FOR SOMETHING CALLED A DENISINE A DENISINE IS A MOLECULE THAT BUILDS UP IN THE BRAIN AN BODY MORE AND MORE THE LONGER WE'VE BEEN AWAKE IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES US FEEL SLEEPY SO WHEN WE DRINK KAFFINE THAT KAFFIN OCCUPIES THE ADENAZINE RECEPTER AND THE A DENIZINE CANNOT HAVE ITS NORMAL EFFECT OF MAKING A SLEEPY WHEN THAT KAFFINE WEARS OFF THE DENAZINE COMBINE AND WE FEEL SLEEPY A DENISINE IS A VAZO DILATOR SO WHEN WE DRINK KAFFINE BECAUSE IT BLOCKS THE EFFECTS OF A DENISINE THERE IS A VAZO CONSTRICTION ASSOCIATE WITH DRINKING KAFFINE SO IF YOU HAVE A HEADACHE THAT IS ASSOCIATE WITH EXCESSIVE VAZO DIL LATION AND PRESSURE IN THE HEAD INDEED DRINKING SOME KAFFINE CAND CAUSE SOME VAZO CONSTRICTION BY PREVENTING THAT A DENISINE PATHWAY THAT WOULD NORMALLY LEAVE TO VAZO CONSTRICTION AND YOU CAN GET SOME RELIEF FROM THAT HEADACHE HOWEVER KAFFINE IS ALSO A VAZO DILATOR KAFFINE HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPINGE ON THE SO CALLED AN O PATHWAY THE NITROCOXIDE PATHWAY WHICH IS A NERVE TO BLOOD PATHWAY THAT INVOLVES A FEW DIFFERENT ENZIMES THAT WE WON'T GET INTO RIGHT NOW BUT MAY BE IN A FUTURE EPISODE THAT CAUSES DILATION OF THE BLOOD VESSELS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE DRINKING KAFFINE CAN ALSO INCREASE VASO DILATION SO AT SORT OF A TOO PRONGED EFFACT NOW ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT THIS AND PERHAPS UTILIZE THIS IS THAT IF YOU ARE WELL RESTED OR IF IT'S EARLY IN THE DAY AND YOU'VE HAD SOME SLEEP THE PREVIOUS NIGHT A DENISINE LEVELS ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE LOW ESPECIALL IF YOU SLEPT VERY WELL THE NIGHT BEFORE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS WHEN YOU AND JESS KAFFINE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO EXPERIENCE THE VAZO CONSTRICTION OFFACTS OF KAFFINE THAT WOULD ORDINARILY BE THERE BY INHIBITING A DENISINE WHY BECAUSE A DENISINE IS NOT PRESENT AT ALL AND UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS DRINKING COFFEE OUGHT TO LEAD TO SOME VAZO DILATION NOT A LOT BUT NONE THE LESS VASO DILATION IF HOWEVER YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT WELL OR IT'S LATE IN THE DAY AND YOU'VE BEEN UP FOR A LONG TIME DRINKING KAFFINE IS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE OF A VAZO CONSTRICTION EFFECT AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOME OF THE TREATMENTS THAT YOU HEREABOUT THAT INVOLVE USING AFFINE TO TREAT HEADACHE ARE AS EXTREME AS O K IF YOU HAVE A HEADACHE AT NIGHT DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE AND THEN GO TO SLEEP A SHE SAW THAT IN THE LITERATURE WHICH I IM CANQUITE BELIEVE BECAUSE YES INDEED SOME PEOPLE CAN FALL ASLEEP AFTER DRINKING KAFFINE BUT WE NOW VERY WELL THANKS TO THE BEAUTIFUL WORK AND SCIENCE COMMUNICATIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE DOCTOR MATHEW WALKER FROM UNIVERSY KALFORNIA BERKLIAN WHO'S BEEN A GUEST ON THIS AND ANY OTHER POD KAS THAT EVEN IF YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP AFTER DRINKING KAFFINE IN JESTING KAFFINE WITHIN THE TEN TO TWELVE HOURS PRIOR TO BEDTIME IS SIMPLY NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE OF THE WAYS IT DESTRUPTS THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP SO WHAT'S TO TAKE AWAY ABOUT KAFFINE AND HEADACHE AND VAZO DILATION YOU NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR ON WEATHER NOT KAFFINE TENDS TO REMOVE YOUR HEADACHE OR EXASSURBATE IT NOW THIS IS GOING TO DEPEND ON TIME O DAY AN THE AMOUNT OF A DENISIN YEAR SYSTEM AS I MENTION BEFORE BUT ALSO THERE SEEMS TO BE A KIND OF BYMODAL DISTRIBUTION WHEREBY SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY DRINK KAFFINE IT REALLY IMPROVES THEIR HEADACHE IT'S A IN SOME CASE O VERY SIGNIFICANT OFFACTS WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE EN THEY DRINK KAFFINE IT REALLY EXASERBATES THEIR HEADACHE AND AS LEAST AS FAR AS I COULD TELL FROM THE LITERATURE IT'S NOT EASY TO PREDICT WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE WHAT IS REASSURING HOWEVER IS IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO EXPERIENCES RELIEF FROM HEADACHES BY DRINKING KAFFINE THAT SUDDENLY ONE DAY TO THE NEXT YOU ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE A WORSENING OF YOUR HEADACHE AND VICE VERSAS ALSO TRUE SO IF YOURE SOMEBODY THAT I'M DRINKS KAFFIN N YOUR HEADACHES GET WORSE I DONT THIN THERE'S ANY REASON TO THINK THAT KAFFINE ONE DAY OR FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT RATHER IS GOING TO SOMEHOW ALLEVIATE YOUR HEADACHE SO YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE FOR YOURSELL WETHER NOT HEADACHES ARE RELIEVED OR EXASSURBATED BY DRINKING KAFFINE AND IF YOURE WONDERING WHY IT'S SO CONFUSING IT'S BECAUS KAFFINE HIT TS BOTH THE VASE OF DILATION AND THE VAS OF CONSTRICTION PATHWAYS AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU OR I OR ANY ONE ELSE CAN DO ABOUT IT NOT THE LAST THING I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF RELIEF FOR HEADACHES IS SOMETHING THAT I'MGUESSING ABOWT PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE PER CENTOF OURE FAMILIAR WITH IN SEVENY FYPERSINT OF VIEU ARE NOT WHICH IS KIRCUMAN KIRCUMEN IS OFTEN ALSO REFERRED TO AS TUMERIC AND TURMERIC IS A ROUT AND KIRCUMEN IS ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THAT ROUT KIRKUMAN IS KNOWN TO HAVE VERY POTENT ANTIINFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES I DON'T THINK THAT'S DEBATED AT ALL IN FACT IT'S SO POTENT AS AN ANTINE FLAMMATORY THAT SOME PEOPLE HAV CAUTIONED AGAINST TAKING HIGH LEVELS OF KIRCUMEN PRIOR TO FOR INSTANCE RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUTS OR EVEN CARDYOVASCULAR WORK OUTS BECAUSE IT SO PREVENTS IN FLAMMATION THAT IT ALSO CAN PREVENT THE ADAPTATION RESPONSE BECAUSE REMEMBER THE INFLAMMATION THAT OCCURS DURING EXERCISE BOTH RESISTANCE IND CARDIVASCULAR EXERCISE IS AT LEAST IN PART THE TRIGGER FOR THE ADAPTATION THAT GOING TO LEAD TO IN HANSTIN DURANCS IN HANSTRENGTH HYPERTROPHY ET CETERA NONE THE LAST KIRKUMAN HAS BEEN EXPLORED IN THE CONTEXTS OF TREATMENT OF MYGRAN AND IT'S ONE OF THE COMPOUNDS THAT WAS ANELYZED IN EXTENSIVE DETAIL IN THIS WONDERFUL REVIEW THAT I MENTION LOBIT EARLIER WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THI STUDY IS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF KIRCUMEN AS EXPLORED IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH STUDIES AND COMPIR THOSE ACROSS A LARGE RANGE OF DIFFERENT DOSAGES AND A LARGE RANGE OF COMMINATIONS WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE COINCIM CUTEN WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE BUT THIN FORSAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION JUST REALLY FOCUSING ON WHAT KIRUMEAN DOES ALONE OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OMEGA THREE FADIACIS IS WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE MOST INTERESTING FIRST OF ALL KIRUMEN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE GENERALLY SAFE FOR MOST PEOPLE AT DOSAGES AS HIGH AS EIGHT THOUSAND MILIGRAMS PER DAY OR EIGHT GRAHMS PER DAY NOW I WANTO BE VERY CLEAR I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANY ONE TAKE DOSAGES OF IRKUMEN AC TUMERIC THAT ARE THAT HIGH WHY WELL KIRCUMEN AND TUMERIC NOT ONLY OUR ANTIINFLAMMATORY BUT THEY ALSO CAN IN PINGE ON OTHER PATHWAYS IN PARTICULAR HORMONAL PATHWAYS AND IN FACT KIRKUMEN A C TUMERIC KAN ALTER THIS SYNTHESIS OF SOMETHING CALLED DIHYDRA TO STOSTRONE DIYDROTISTOSTRONA IS INVOLVED AN ENORMOUS RANGE OF DIFERENT BODILY FUNCTIONS IT'S INVOLVED IN LABIDO IT'S INVOLVED IN MEN IN BEARD GROWTH AND IN THE REGULATION OF OF NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TISSUES BOTH IN THE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS AND OUTSIDE THE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS AND KIRCUMEN IS A POTENT INHIBITER OF D H T SO I DO ONT AF CAUTION THAT PEOPLE WHO TAKE HYDOSES OF KIRCUMEN AND SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO KIRCUMEN WELL EVEN AT LODOSIS EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN D H T THAT LEAD TO THINGS THAT THEY WOULD NOT LIKE SUCH AS SUFFICION OF REDUCTIONS IN LEBIDO HOWEVER KIRCUMAN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE AS AN ANTINE FLAMMATORY AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN TREATING DIFFERENTYPES OF HEADACHE AN PARTICULAR MYGRAN HEADACHE ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH KIRKUMEN DOES THAT T IS TO INHIBIT THE THING THI TALKED ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO WHICH IS NITRIC OXIDE OR ANO WHICH CAUSES VASE OF DILATION AND IN DOING THAT CAN REDUCE THE FEELING THAT ONE HAS A LOT OF INTRCRANIAL PRESSURE ASSO KIRKUMEN DOSAGES COMMON ENORMOUS RANGE AS I MENTION BEFORE DOSAGES THAT RANGE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTY MILIGRAMS TAKEN EIHTY MILIGRAMS PER DAY THAT IS TAKIN FOR EIGHT WEEKS TIME THAT'S BEEN EXAMINED IT'S BEEN EXPLORED TO EIGHTY MILIGRAM DOSAGES TAKN ALONGSIDE TO AN A HALF GRAHAMS OF OMEGA THREE FADIACIDS OR OMAGOS THREE FADIACIDS ALONE AND AGAINST PLACIBO AND THE GENERAL CONCLUSION OF THESE STUDIES IS THAT KIRCUMEN WHEN TAKEN AT DOSAGES OF A BOUT EIGHTY MILIGRAMS ALTHOUGH FOR THOSE OF YOU VERY SENSITIVE TO KIRCUMAN PROBALYAUS LOW IS TWENTY FIVE OR EVEN FIFTY MILIGRAMS PER DAY IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALTHOUGH NOT NECESSARILY AT THE SAME TIME BUT TAKIN DAILY ALONGSIDE OMAGA THREE FADIACIDS AT TWO AND A HALF GRAMS PER DAY LED TO SIGNIFICAN IMPROVEMENTS IN MYGRAIN AND OTHER FORMS OF HEADACHEMEANING BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND THE INTENSITY THE EADACHES THAT OCCURRED WAS GREATLY REDUCED ONE IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT KIRCUMEN TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT KIRCUMEN IS KNOWN TO INHIBIT SOMETHING CALLED CYDACHROME P FOR FIVE ZERO THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH ENZOMATIC PATHWAY AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT RELATE TO BLOOD COAGULATION SO FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING MEDICATIONS THAT ARE ANTI COAGULENTS TO PREVENT CLOTTING YOU DO NEED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT USING KIRCUMAN OF COURSE WITH KIRKUMEN OR ANY OTHER SUPPLEMENT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR A PRIOR TO INCLUDING IT OR REMOVING IT A FROM YOUR SUPPLEMENT REGIMENT SO AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IN ADDITION TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND OVER THE COUNTER PAIN MEDICATIONS THINGS LIKE NON STERAD ANTINE FLAMATORY DRUGS CAN REALLY IMPACT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HEADACHE AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHE IN SOME CASES DIFFERENTIALLY NOW TO DAY WE TALKED MAINLY ABOUT TENSION TYPE AND MIGRANE TYPEHEADACHES BECAUSE THOSE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF HEADACHE THERRE OF COURSE THE CLUSTER TYPE HEADACHES THAT ARE OF NURAL ORIGIN BT HORMONAL HEADACHES AND INDEED SOME TREATMENTS SUCH AS OMEGA THREES WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR OFFSETTING THE MENSTRAL RELATED HEADACHES NOW IN THE CONTECTS OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OMEGA THREES KEEP IN MIND THAT OMAG THREES CAN BE OBTAINED FROM SUPPLEMENTATION OR FROM NEUTRICION SO YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO TAKE OMEGA THREE CAPSULS OR LIQUID FORMOMEGATHREES IF YOU WANT TO USE OMEGATHREES TO TARGET DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS OF HEADACHE BUT THAT PROBABLY'S GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO IT GIVEN THAT MANY FOODS DO CONTAIN OMEGA THREES BUT IT'S HARD TO GET ABOVE THAT ONE GRAHM DOSAGE IN IN FACT MOST OF THE STUDIES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY INVOLVED GETTING TWO OR EVEN TO AND A HALF ORE IN SOME CASES ON THIS PODCAST WITH PREVIOUS GUSTS SUCH AS DOCTORONOPATRIC ICH TALKED ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF GETTING AS HIGH AS THREE GRAHMS OF OMEGA THREES PER DAY WHICH ALMOST WITH CERTAINTY IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME EXTERNAL FORM OF SUPPLEMENTATION EVEN FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE MAKING A POINT TO EAT A FATTY OCEAN FISH WITH THE SKIN ON SO I JUST ONE MAKE SURE THAT A HILIKE THAT BEFORE WE WRAP UP I CAN'T HELP MYSELF BUT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I HEARD ABOUT ON THE NEW SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IT SOUNDED TOO OUTRAGEOUS TO BE TRUE BUT THEN WAS CONFIRMED AS ACCURATE BY ONE OF MY NAUROLOGISTS COLLEAUES THAT'S THE FACT THET EATING CERTAIN VERY SPICY PEPPERS CAN INDUCE HEADACHE AND IN SOME CASES CAN INDUCE BRAIN DAMAGE AND A BEAR WITH ME HERE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR TRADITIONAL HOLOPANIO AND I'M ACKNOWLEDGING THE FACT THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN TOLERATE FAR MORE SPICY TASTE THAN DO OTHERS SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO SPICY SOME PEOPLE CAN TOLERATE VERY SPICY FOOD AND THAT ONE CAN BUILD UP A TOLERANCE TO SPICY FOOD BY INGESTING PROGRESSIVELY SPICY ER EXCUSE ME SPICY ER AND SPICY OR FOODS OVERTIME NONE THELESS THERE ARE THESE PEPPER EATING CONTESTS OUT THERE THAT U WHILE NOT VERY COMMON DO EXIST IND PEOPLE CHALLENGE EACH OTHER TO EAT PEPPERS OF UM EXTREME SPICINESS THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT'S REFER TO AS THE CAROLINA REAPER BY THE WY THAT'S NOT A PERSON AS FAR AS I KNOW UM THAT'S A PEPPER THE CAROLINA REAPER WHICH IS KNOWN TO HAVE THE MOST POTENT SPICE OF ANY PEPPER AND HERE'S WHY YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO EAT THE CAROLINA REAPER A FEW YEARS AGO AT ONE OF TESE PEPPEREATING CONTESTS A MAN EAT A CAROLINA REAPER SPAR OF THE COMPETITION AND SUDDENLY EXPERIENCE WHAT'S CALLED THUNDER CLAPHEADACHE THUNDER CLAP HEADACHE IS A UNIQUE TYPE OF HEADACHE VERY DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER TYPES OF HEADACHE IT IS NOT FROM THE SURFACE IN SO IT'S NOT TENSION HEADACHE IT'S NOT EVEN THE CLUSTER TYPE HEADACHE OF THE NERVE ACTIVATION OF THE TRIGEMINAL IT'S ACTUALLY A HIPER CONSTRICTION OF THE VASCULATURE IN THE BRAIN CAUSED PY THE INGESTION OF THE PEPPER AND INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND REMEMBER THAT HEAT AND SPICY GO TO GATHER IN THESE NEURAL PATHWAYS AND A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT HEAT RELATED AND SPICE RELATED PATHWAYS GET ACTIVEATED SIMULTANEOUSLY WHEN ONE INJEST SOMETHING OF EXTREME SPICE AND THE BLOOD VESSELS AND INDEED SOME OF THE A SMALLER ARTERIES FEEDING NEURAL TISSUE SHUT DOWN AND HE EXPERIENCE THIS THUNDER CLAPHEADACHE WHICH IS A BRUTAL HEADACHE AND A SADLY IN HIS CASE AM PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE THE LOSS OF NAURONAL TISSUE BECAUSE NAURONAL TISSUE IS VERY METABOGALLY ACTIVE YOU CUT OFF THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THAT TISSUE NOT ONLY WOULD YOU FEEL MISERABLE U MAYBE EVEN PASS OUT BUT UM LOSE VISION AND CERTAIN BRAIN AIR IS WLASHY DIE OFF IN THE ABSENCE OF A BLOOD FLOWD TOF THOSE AREAS AM WE KNOW THIS A MORE COMMONLY AS STROKE SO I DON'T WANT TO UM STRIKE A FEAR IN ANYBODY ABOUT EATING A YOU KNOW A HOLOPENIO  OR EVEN A VERY SPICY MEAL FROM TIME TO TIME BUT IF YOU'RE NOT SOMEBODY WHO'S FAMILIAR WITH EATING VERY SPICY FOODS A YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO ENTER ONE OF THESE A COMPETISIONS AND JUST REALIZE THAT THE PATHWAYS FROM MENTHALL AND COOL OR SPICY AND HOT THOSE ARNCHOUS SUBJECTIVE PATHWAYS THESE ARE ACTULLY NERL PATHWAYS THAT AGAIN ORIGINATE IN AR SO CLTS ERDS CALL IT THE SENSORY EPOTHELIUMS OR SKIN ARE ARE HEARING OUR EYES A AND THAT FEED THAT INFORMATION INTSO THE BODY TO MACHE A USE OF THAT INFORMATION SOME CASES MOTOR MOVEMENTS OF SENSERY MOTER IN OTHER CASES A THE INFORMATION CAN BE FED THROUGH NERVE PATHWAYS THAT GOES TO THE VASCULATURE AND CAUSES OF VASCATURE TO EITHER DILATE OR CONSTRICT THESE VERY SPICY PEPPERS CAUSING AS I JUST MENTION EXTREME SEREBREAU OF OF THE HEAD A VASO CONSTRICTION AND BRAIN DAMAGE AGAIN THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A A COMMON THING OUT THERE BUT NONE THE LESS A I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE CAROLINA REAPER SO TO DAY WE TALKED ABOUT HEADACHES AND FIRST WE HIGHLIGHTED THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEADACHEMAKING IT CLEAR THAT UNDERSTANDING WHICH HEADACHE YOU MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING WHICH SORTS OF TREATMENTS OUGHT TO BE BEST AND PERHAPS ALSO BEST AVOIDED IN TRYING TO ALLEVIATE THOSE HEADACHES OR PREVENT THEM FROM HAPPENING AT ALL WE TALK ABOUTTENSION HEADACHES MYGRAIN HEADACHES HORMON BASEHEADACHES CLUSTER HEADACHES AND TRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY RELATED HEADACHES WE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TREATMENTS RANGING FROM CREATINE TO A MEGATHREE FATIACID SUPPLEMENTATION SOME URBAL AND INDEED SOME ESSENTIAL OIL TREATMENTS AS WELL AS ACUPUNCTURE ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN REDUCING THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF HEADACHES AND IN MANY CASES REDUCTIONS IN THE FREQUENCY AND INTENTSITY OF HEADACHE THAT ARE AT LEAST AS GREAT AS THE RESULTS THEY ARE SEEN WITH NONSTEROID ANTIN FLAMATORY DRUGS AGAIN I WANT A HIGHLIGHT THAT NONE OF THESE APPROACHES ARE NECESSARILY DESIN TO BE DONE ON THEIR OWN OR IN REPLACEMENT OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM YOUR PHYSICIN THERE ARE EXCELLENT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OUT THERE THAT YOUR PHYSICION CAN PRESCRIBE FOR YOU FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEADACH NONE THE LESS I THINK MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENERS OF THIS POCASTS ARE INTERESTED IN THE THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO IN ORDER TO INOCULATE THEMSELVES OR AT LEAST REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXPERIENCING HEADACHE ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC RECURRING HEADACHES SUCH AS MY GRAIN OR THE OTHER FORMS

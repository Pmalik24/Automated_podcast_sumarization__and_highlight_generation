WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN AO SCIENCE SCIENCEAYTO FO I'M ENDERCUBERMEN AND OM R PROFESSOR OF NUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR LANE NORTON DOCTOR NORTON IS ONE OF THE FOREMOST EXPERTS IN PROTENE METABOLISM FAT LOSS AND NUTRITION HE DID HIS DEGREES IN BILE CHEMISTRY AND NUTRICIONAL SCIENCES AND IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE WORLD EXPERTS AND UNDERSTANDING HOW WE EXTRACT ENERGY FROM OUR FOOD AND HOW EXERCISE AND WHAT WE EAT COMBINE TO IMPACT THINGS LIKE BODY COMPOSITION AND OVER ALL HEALTH TO DAY WE DISCUSS AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF TOPICS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF NUTRITION AND FITNESS INCLUDING FOR INSTANCE WHAT IS ENERGY BALANCE THAT IS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY EXTRACT ENERGY FROM OUR FOOD WE ALSO DISCUSS THE SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS WHETHER NOT THEY ARE SAFE OR NOT AND WETHER R NOT THEY ARE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR WEIGHT LOSS IN PARTICULAR FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM OBICITY AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF DIABETIES WE ALSO TALK ABOUT GOT HEALTH THAT IS THE GOT MYCROBIOM AND HOW IT'S IMPACTED BY FOOD AND HOW IT CAN ACTUALLY IMPACT THE METABOLISM OF THE FOODS THAT WE EAT WE ALSO DISCUSS FASTING OR SO CALLED INTERMENT IN FASTING OR TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING WHAT IT DOES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IN TERMS OF HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS FOR WEIGHT LOSS AND PERHAPS EVEN FOR HEALTH AND LONGEVITY WE LSO TALK ABOUT PROTINE AND TO FIND VERY CLEARLY HOW MUCH PROTINE EACH AND ALL OF US NEED DEPENDING ON OUR DAILY ACTIVITIES AND LIFE DEMANDS WE DISCUSS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DIETS THAT YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT INCLUDING KETOGENIC DIETS VIGAN DIETS VEGETARIAN DIETS AND PURE CARNIVORE DITS AS WELL AS MORE TYPICAL OMNIVORE DIETS AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET ALL OF THE ESSENTIALLY MENOACIDS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR HEALTHY WEIGHT MAINTENANCE WEIGHT LOSS OR DIRECTED MUSCULE GANG WE ALSO TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS IN PARTICULAR THE SUPPLEMENTS FOR WHICH THERE IS AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF SCIENCE POINTING TO THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY FOR FITNESS AND FOR OVER ALL BODY COMPOSITION WHAT I'M SURE WILL BECOME CLEAR TO YOU AS YOU HEAR LAINE TALK ABOUT EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THESE TOPICS IS THAT HE HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO BOTH UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISTIC SCIENCE BUT ALSO THE REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS OF THE VARIOUS DISCOVERIES THAT ARE MADE IN PARTICULAR PAPERS AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT IE WHEN A GIVEN SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS AS BEEN RAISED HE'S EXTREMELY GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING WHY IT WAS RAISED BUT ALSO AT A VALUATING WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD WHICH IS WHAT I BELIEVE MOST EVERYBODY OUT THERE IS CONCERNED WITH I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES HIM FROM THE OTHER VOICES IN THE NUTRITIONAL LANDSCAPE I ASSURE YOU THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU WILL HAVE A MUCH CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THE SCIENCE SAYS ABOUT NUTRITIAN ABOUT FITNESS END ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT DIETS AND FITNESS PROGRAMS COMBINE TO ACHIEVE THE RESULTS THAT YOU WANT BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER R PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE IN SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME ID LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTOROLIKTE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR WSALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURRANTS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONTS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITS NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANTS ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TO LECTROLIKTE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAHM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDR MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT  DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENT  DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WOULD DOCTOR LANE NORTON LANE DOCTOR NORTON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING AND HAVE TO SAY I'M REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE I'VE SEEN YOU IN THE SOCIA MEDIA SPHERE I'VE ALSO LISTENED TO A NUMBER OF YOUR OTHER PODCASTS AND AS A FELLOW PH D SCIENTIST I FEEL A GREAT KINSHIP WITH YOU I KNOW YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE IN IN FITNESS IN NUTRITION AND NUMBER OF AREAS WE ALSO GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM OUR AUDIENCE AND I'M REALLY LOOCING FOR TO TALKING WITH YOU TO DAY  EXCITED TO ME THIS LIKE YOU HS BEEN SOMETHING EN TALKING ABOUT FOR LONG TIME SO AS GLAMERY L MAKE IT HAPPEN YA INDEED AND AM I THINK SOME OF THE AUDIENCE  HAS REQUESTED A DEBATE OR A BATTLE AND I CAN HAH HA 'S NOT GON TO HAP AND ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT UM BROUGHT LANE AND I TOGETHER I IN CONVERSATION ON LINE AND THEN VIA TEXT ET CETERA WAS THE FACT THAT I LOVE TO BE CORRECTED  AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED I I DID OPPOST ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT A LTLEBIT LATER IN THE EPISODE AND LANE POINTED OUT SOME AREAS OF THE STUDY THAT I HAD MISSED UM OR MAYBEVE MISUNDERSTOOD AND I PROVISE MY OPINIONS AND I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL AND OTHER STUDIES HOVE COME OUT SINCE THEN SO HOPEFULLY OUR CONVERSATION WILL SERVE AS A AS A MESSAGE OF HOW A SCIENCE AND ACTION WILL SCIENCE CAN UM CAN BE PERCEIVED AND AND AND THAT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE A BATTLE BUT HEY IF WE GET INTO IT WE GET INTO IT UM I WON'T GET PHYSICAL BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU WOULD WE HA A HA HA A HA IN ANY CASE I'D LIKE TO START UM WITH SOMETHING THAT'S RATHER BASIC AND YET UM CAN BE PRETTY COMPLEX UM AND THAT'S THIS ISSUE OF ENE RGY BALANCE AND ENERGY UTILIZATION I THINK MUST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF A CALORY UM I MASSUMING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T ACTION KNOW WHAT THAT IS IN TERMS OF HOW IT WORKS  WHAT IT REPRESENTS AND  SOME MADE YOU COULD JUST EXPLAIN FOR PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE EAT FOOD OF ANY KIND AND HOW IS THAT ACTIAL CONVERTED INTO ENERGY AS A WAY OF FRAMING UP THE DISCUSSION AROUND WEIGHT LOST WEIGHT MATENANCE WEIGHT GAIN AND BODY COMPOSITION SE GREAT QUESTION AND LIKE YOU SAID THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE NOW PEOPLE USE THE TERM CALORIES AN CALLORIES OUT THEY SAID WELL THAT'S WAY TOO SIMPLISTIC I'M LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES UP CALORIES AN CALORIES OUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY COMPLICATED RIGHT SO LET'S DEA WITH THE A WHAT YOU MENTIONED FIRST WHAT IS A CALORY BECAUS I THINK A LOD PEOPLE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THIS SO CALORY JUST REFERS TO A UNIT OF ENERGY OF HEAT SPECIFICALLY AND SO WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH FOOD WHAT IS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH LIKE WHAT WE DIGEST AND EAT REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE POTENTIAL CHEMICAL ENERG THAT IS IN THE BONDS OF THE MACHRONUTRIATS OF FOOD RIGHT AND BY DIGESTING ASSIMILATING AND METABOLIZING THOSE NEUTRIANS WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE ENERGY AND THE INPRODUCT OF THAT MOSTLY IS E T P A A DENIZN TRY PHOSPHATE WHICH IS YOUR BODIES  ENERGY CURRENCY SO TO UNDERSTAND E T P TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO POWER THESE VARIOUS REACTIONS IN YOUR BODY AYOU RETALK ABOUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ENZIMES THAT REQUIRE A T P AM YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT YO WOULD HAVE TO CREATE A MUNCH OF MICRO EXPLOSIONS RIGHT YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT CAN TRANSFER HIGH ENERGY PHOSPHATES TO POWER THESE REACTIONS TO GIVE UP ESSENTIALLY IT'S ENERGY TO POWER SOMETHING THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE UNFAVORABLE SO A LOT OF METABOLISM IS SIMPLY CREATING E T P WHICH THE IN OF THE LINE OF THAT NIKE F A KIND OF WORK BACKWARDS IS WHAT'S CALLED OXATE OF RESPIRATION SO THAT HAPPENS THE MONICHONDRE ERE BUT IS HEARD MNICONDREA POWER HOUSE OF THE CELL AND THAT IS DONE A THROUGH ESSENTIALLY CREATING A HYDROGEN ION GRADIAN ACROSS THE MITACONDREA WHICH POWERS THE PRODUCTION OF AH T P BY CONVERTING FREE PHOSPHATE PLUTS AIGHTY P TO E T P NOW THE WAY THAT HYDROGEN ION GRATING IS CREATED IS THROUGH A YOU KNOW CREATING HYDRODOGE HYDROGEN IONS LIKE BE DONATED THROUGH THE CREBCYCLE NOW THE CREB CYCLE IS LINKED TO LICOLISIS SO FE TOABOUT CARA HYDRATE METABOLISM CROMHYDRATES BASICALLY OTHER THAN FRUCTOS GET CONVERTED INTO GLUCOS WHICH CAN GO N T GLIKE CALLUS HIS AND YOU CAN PRODUCE SOME EIGH T PIECS THROUGH LIKOLYSIS AND THEN IT BOLLS DOWN TO PYRUVATE THEN A SEETAL OAY WHICH GOES TO THE CREBCYCLE PRODUCES A LOT MORE EIGH T PIES FROM THAT I'V YOU TOAB OU PROTINE PROTINES AL BUT DIFFERENT BECAUSE PROTINE I GETS CONVERTED TO AMETOACIDS BUCH CAN BE USED FOR MUSCLE PROTINE SYNTHESIS OR PROTINE CETESIS ANOTHER TISSUES A BUT IT ALSO CAN BE CONVERTED THROUGH GLICANEGENESIS TO GLUCOS AND THERE ALSO ARE SOME KEETOGENICA MENOACIS AS WELL A AND SO YOU CAN HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE CREB CYCLE A EITHER BEING THROUGH A ASEETL COA OR THROUGH GLUE COS GOING TROUG THE C GLICCOLYSIS TO PYRUVATE THEN YOU HAVE FADIACIDS WHICH A ARE ABLE TO CREATE ENERGY THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED BATE OXIDATION WHERE ESSENTIALLYOU'RE TAKING THESE FATYACIDS IN YOUR LOPPING THEM OFF TO CARBONS AT A TIME TO PRODUCE THE SETAL COAY WHICH AGAIN CAN GO IN TOE CREB CYCLE PRODUCE TOSE HYDRED DIONS THE CAN TEN POWER THE PRODUCTION OF EIGHT T P SO THAT'S KIND OF LIKE AT THE SALUO LEVEL OF HOW THIS STUFF WORKS BUT STEPPING BACK AND TAKEN IT BACK OUT LIKE WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH WEIGHT LOSS FROR MEIGHT GAIN RAN WELL WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE BALANCE OF ENERGY AND VERSEIS ENERGY OUT SOUNDS VERY SIMPLE BUT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT AXY MAKES UP ENERGY AND VERSE ENERGY OUT FIRST OF ALL YOUVE GOT TO REALIZE THAT THE ENERGY INSIDE THE ECQUATION IS MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACT THAN PEOPLE THINK RIGHT SO ONE A FOOD LABELS WHICH WE LIKE TO THINK IS BEING YOU KNOW LIKE FROM UPON HIGH A CAN HAVE UP TO A TWENTY PER CENT AIR IN THEM REALLY OH YET SO A HUNDRED CALLERY  SOMETHING LISS IS A HUNDRED CALLORIES PRESERVING IT COULD WHAT'S ACTIN IN THERE CAN BE BE HERE HUNDRED AND TWENTY RIGHT EXACTLY SO THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF IT THE SECOND ASPECT IS THERE'S WHAT'S CALLED YOUR ENERGY BUT THE THOWS ALSO MATABOLIZABLE ENERGY RIGHTSO IF YOU HAVE A FOOD STUFF WITH SA LOT OF INSOUBLE FIBRE TYPICALLY INSOLIBLE FIBERE A'S NOT REALLY DIGESTIBLE AND SO YOU COULD HAVE YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT OF CARBAL HYDRATE YOU KNOW BUT IF YOU CAN'T EXTRACT THE ENERGY FROM IT AND TYPICALLY THIS IS BECAUSE INSOABLE FIBRE FROM LIKE PLANT MATERIAL THE CARBAL HYDRATE OR AND EVEN SOMEOF THE PROTINE IS BOUND UP IN THE A PLANT STRUCTURE WHICH MAKES IT INACCESSIBLE TO DIGESTIVE INSIMES AND SO THIS IS WHAT LIKE ADDS BOLKTER SCHOOL STHOOL WHAT NOT BUT AGAIN REDUCES THE MATABOLIZABLE ENERGY IN THER AND THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT BASED ON PEOPLES INDIVIDUAL GUT MACROBIOM THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY AXY BE BETTER AND EXTRACTING ENERGY OUT OF FIBER COMPARED TO OTHER PEOPLE SO JUST STARTING OFF RIGHT THERE OCCA THERES THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF PLAY IN THE ENERGY INSIDE OF THINGS NOW ONE OF THINGS PEOPLE WILL SAY IS WELL SEE THAT'S WHY ITION WHERE ABOUT TRACTING CALLERIES CAUSE YOU KNOW OF THE FOOD LABLS CAN BE TWENTY PER CENT OFF AND WHAT I'LL SAY IS LOKI THAT'S A THAT'S I UNDERSTAND WE ARE COMING FROM BUT TYPICALLY IF IT'S OFFICE COULD BE CONSISTENTLY OFF AND IF YOU'RE CONSISTENT WITH HOW YOU TRACK IT EVENTUALLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KNOW KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE TAKING IN AND IT'S GOT THAT'S KIND OF LIKE SAYING WELL DON'T WORRY ABOUT TRACKING YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE I OLITO USE FINANCIAL A EXAMPLES YOU KNOWL WE KNOW THAT TO SAVE MONEY OR YOU IFE TO EARN MORE MONEY THAN YOU SPEND WELL YOU CAN'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'RE EARNING AT A TIME YOU KNOW CAUSE THERE'S INFLATION AND THEN THERE'S AH IF YOU AVE INVESTMENTS THOSE CAN BE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT INTEREST RATES AND WHAT NOT 'SAY O CATE BUT YOU'RE YOU NOIFYOUHAVE A BUDGET YOUHAVE A REASONABLE IDEA OF WHAT IT'S GOIN TO BE YOU KNOW AND YOU MAKE YOU MAKE CERTAIN THE SUMPTIONS BUT YOU CAN RELATIVELY GUESS NOW THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE RIGHT SO NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE ENERGY OUTSIDE OF THE EQUATION WHICH IS ACT YOU WAY MORE COMPLICATED RIGHT AND SAY YOU'RE ENERGY OUT IS A FEW DIFFERENT A BUCKETS THE FIRST ONE IN THE BIGGEST ONE IS YOUR RESTING METABOLIC RATE SO YOU'R ARMAR AND THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE IS ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF YOUR TOTAL DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE NOW PEOPLE USE THE TERM MENABOLIC RATE AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE KIND OF ENTERCHANGEABLY BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THING SO YOU'RE TOTAL DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE IS THE SUMMATION OF ALL THE ENERGY YOU EXPEND IN A DAY RACKING UPSTAIRS EXERCISE IF YOU DO IT FIDGETING YET PLUST EUR RESTING MENABOLICRY RIGHT SO RESTING METABALK WATE IS A BIG PART OF THAT BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING SO THAT CHOOSES ABOUT FIFTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT AND SEDENTARY PEOPLE WILL BE ON THE HIGHER END OF THAT SO' BE A BIGGER PROPORTION WHEREAS PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE ACTIVE IT'LL BE A LIBUT LOWER NOT BECAUSE THEYR METBALK RATE IS LOWER BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENDING A GREATER PERCENGE OF THE CALORIES FROM PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE THERMIC EFFECT OF FOOD WHICH IS A RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR TOLD DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE IT'S ABOUT FIVE TO TEN PER CENT AH AND VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AND USUALLY WHAT RESEARCHERS DO WHEN THEY'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT THE STUFF AS THEY JUST KIND OF MAKE AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT IT THEY USE A CONSTANT AH BUT THAT'S ABOUT FIVE TO TEN PER CENT OF YOUR DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND THAT REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IT TAKES TO EXTRACT THE ENERGY OUT OF FOOD SO THINK ABOUT YOUR BODY KIND OF LIKE A CAR RIGHT YOU DON'T JUST HAVE GAS IND YOUR TANK AND ITS SPONTANEOUSLY STARTS OUT RIGHT LIKE YOIF TO HAVE A BATTERIES YOU PUT IN ENERGIES WOE CAN GET THE ENERGY OUT OF THE THE PETROL AT YOU HAVE IN YOUR CAR SIMILAR WITH WITH FOOD YOU CAN'T JUST EAT FOOD AND THEN YOU KNOW IT JUST APPEARS IN YOUR SELVES AND YOU START DOING STUFF IT HAS TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY BROKEN DOWN AND PUT INTO FORMS THAT CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE ENERGY AND SO YOU HAVE TO PUT SOME ENERGY AND TO ACHIEVE THAT AND A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE WELL NOT ALL CALORIES ARE CRATED EQUAL THOT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE CALORIES JUST AN UNIT OF MEASUREMENT RIGHT THAT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING NOT ALL SECONDS ON A C LOCK AR CREATIVE EQUAL YES THEY ARE ALL SOURCES OF CALORIES MAY HAVE DIFFERENT SHAL EFFECTS ON ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND APPETITE SO IF WE LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE AM FAT FOR EXAMPLE THE T F OF FAT IS NOT ZURTO THREE PER CENT MEANING IF YOU'D A HUNDRED CALRIES FROM FAT YOU'RE NT WILL BE ABOUT NINETY SEVEN TO A HUNDRED SAID THE PROCESS OF BREAKING DOWN THAT FAT I SUCH HESOB TRACTS SOME OF THE THE CALORIES AWAY BECAUSE YU USED IT IN CREATING ENERGY CORI BREAKING THOSE CHEMICAL BONDS TO CREATE E TEPY CORRECT OKRECT SO YOU HAVE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SOME INZIMES TAT REQUIRE EIGHT P TO RUN THESE PROCESSES NOW FAT IS ACTUALLY THE EASIEST THING TO CONVERT INTO ENERGY THEN YOU HAVE CRORBLE HYDATE WHICH HAS A T F OF LIKE FIVE TO TEN PER CENT SO YOU EAT  HUNDRED CALORS FROM CORBEHYDRTE AND OVICY LIKE THE FIBRA CONTENT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE ON THIS BUT YOU EAT  HUNDRED CALORIES YOU'LL NET NINETY TO NINETY FIVE PROTIN IS ABOUT A TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT T  F SO IF YOU'D HUNDRED CALLORS FROM PROACHING YOU'RE ONLY NETTING SEVENTY TO EIGHTY NOW YOU'RE STILL NET YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY WHILE YOU CAN'T EAT TOO MUCH PROTINE WELL YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL ASK WIL CON PROACHING BESTORTOS FAT THE CARBONS FROM PROACHING IT'S UNLIKELY TOCAN A WIND UP AN AUTOPOST TISSUE BUT IF YOU'RE EATING A LOT OF PROACHING OVER ALLS PART OF A LOT OF CALORIES IT DOES IT HAS TO BE OXIDIZED AND A CAN'T PROVIDE A CALORY CUSHION FOR OTHER THINGS TO BE STORED IN FAT BUT PROACHING ITSELF DOES PROVIDE YOU KNOW A NET POSITIVE FOR CALORIES BUT LESS SO THAN CARBHITER OR FAT AND TENSITY MORE SATIATING SO AGAIN WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW ARE ALL CALORIES CREATE EQUAL YES BUT ALL SOURCES OF CALORIES MAY HAVE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS ON ENERGY EXPENITURANT APPETITE THAT'S THE T F BUCKET AND THE B IM OR BUCKET THEN WE GO TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS ESSENTIALLY TWO PARTS THERE'S EXERCISE WHICH IS KIND OF YOUR PURPOSEFUL MOVEMENTS LIKE YOU OGE FOR A WALK YOU DO TRAINING SESSION WHATEVER ANY PURPOSEFUL ACTIVITY AND THEN YOU HAVE WHAT'S CALLED NEAT WHICH IS NON EXERCISE ACTIVITY THROM MAGENESIS WHICH I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY COOL IT'S FASCINATED  IAT IS SO IT'S I WAS ACTUALLY HANGING OUT WITH SOMEBODY LAST NIGHT AND I WAS NOTICING THEM THEY THEY WERE FIDGETING THEIR FEET AND THEIR THEIR FINGERS AND I SAID NOW IF YOU ALWAYS LIKE BEEN PRETTY LEAN ND ERE LIKE YET I NEVER REALLY HAD A PRO PROBLEM MAINTAINING LEANNESS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OBS RESISTENT FENA TYPE PEOPLE THINK THEY HAFE HIGH B AM AR OR YOU KNOW THEY EXERCISE LOT AND REALLY WHANTED IT IT SEEMS TO BE AS NET THEY TEN TO IF THEY OVER EAT THEY JUST SPONTANEOUSLY INCREASED THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY NOW PEOPLE GET NEAT CONFUSED IHAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY WHIL MAN GOT FOR A WALK TO GET MY NEAT UP THAT'S NOT NEAT NEAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN CONSCIOUSLY MODIFY BUT YOU'RE DOING THERE IF IT'S PURPOSEFUL ITS EXERCISE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WHAT I'M TALKING IF I'M WAVING AROUND MY HANDS IF IM TAPPING MY FEET IF I'M WHATEVER THAT'S NEAT BUT YOU KNOW TRYING TO LIKE GET YOURSELF I'M JUST GOOD A TAP MY F UT MORE WELL NOW IF I'M CONSCIOUSLY HAVING TO DO THIS THAN MY FOK IS AME YU YOU KNOW HOW THE BRAIN WORKS VERY HARD TO DO YOU DON'T REALLY DO TWO THINGS IT WANCE SORI YOU KIND OF SWITCH QUICKLY BETWEEN TATS I RIGHTLY CAN I QUICKLY ASK A WAS THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO OUR FRIEND A BEN BRUNO NOW NOW YOUES HE IS FIDGETY  AMAZING ON LINE FITNESS CHANNEL A HE'S A FREAKISHLY STRONG INDIVIDUAL I A YA AND A AM I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER NOT BEN YOURE A FIDGETOR OR NOT BUT ANYWAY OFF TO GO GO CHACK AND WILL MEASURE YOUR FIDGETING AM ABOUT A NON EXERCISEING YOU SERMAGASIS NEAT A MY ENDERSTANDING OF THE OLD PAPERS ON THIS OLD BE I GUESS BACK TO THE MIDNINETES YA TAT THE CALLORY BURN FROM NEAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED CALLORIES WICH YOU ONER CALLIS PERDAY WE'E DRYING ABOUT IN SOME CASES HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND IESCUE A HUNDREDS TO MAYBE EVEN CLOSE TO A THALSAND CALLORIES PERDAY COULD YOU LABERATE ON THE YES SO THERE AS ACTIONA REALLY CLASSIC STUDY I THINK FROM ONE  SATS FROM LEVIN IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IS MEABOLK WORD STUDY AND HOPELE I DON'T BUTCHER THE STUDY BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW PULLIT OUT OF MY BRAIN I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO HAVE  MUST SAY YOU HAVE IT A I QUITE EXTENSIVE A PUBMED IDEE A GRAB BAG IN THERE SO TRY TO BRING THE RECEIPTS A I TRY TO BING THE RECEIPT WE CAN BUT WE WILL PUT A LINK TO THIS STUDY IN THE SHOWNO CASHION SO A A PEOPLE CAN PRUISE IT IF THEY LIKE SO I BELIEVE THEY HAD PEOPLE OVER EAT N I THINK IT WAS BY LIKE A THOUSAND CALLORIES DAY AND I THINK FPER SIX WEEKS EN I MEAN THIS IS THE MEDAL LIC WORD SO THEY ARE THIS IS VERY TIGHTLY CONTROLLED IT'S AS TIGHT AS YOU GET AND WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS OF COURSE ON AVERAGE PEOPLE GAINED WAIGHT AND GAINED FATMASS BUT SOME PEOPLE GAINED MORE THAN EXPECTED AND THERE WAS ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR WHO ONLY GAINED LIKE JUST OVER HALF A KILO RIGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE GAINED LIKE I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THREE TO FOUR KILOS IT WAS WAS PREDICTED AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THIS INGE OF INDIVIDUAL JUST SPONTANEOUSLY INCREASED THE'R PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT E DIDN'T PURPOSELY DO IT IT JUST HAPPENED AND I MEAN YOU NO ANECDOTALLY I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAIN YOU KNOW VERY LEAN EVEN EAT A MEAL SIT DOWN AND START SWEATING YOU KNOW AND BE VERY FIDGETY THERE IS A A NATURAL BODYBLR BACK IN THE DAY NAMED JIM CORDOVA AND THIS GY WAS JUST VERY LEAN ALL THE TIME AND HE WAS EXACTLY THAT FINOTYPE YOU KNOW HE WOULD WALK UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS AND ALL THE SUNNY SWEATING SIT DOWN EAN TO MEAL HE SWEATING YOU KNOW HUUST HE'S A FURNACE JUST EXPENDING ENERGY AND WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING ABOUT NEAT IS THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST MODIFIABLE I MEAN EXERCISE VERY MODIFIABLE CAUSE YOU CAN BE INTENTIONAL WITH THAT BUT OF YOU DON'T BE AMOUR T E F AND NEAT NEAT SEEMS TO BE FAR MORE MODIFIABLE SO EVEN A BODYWEIGHT REDUCTION OF TEN PER CENT THEY OBSERVED A DECREASE AND NEAT OF ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED CALLORIES A DAY FOR FOR A TEN PER CENT A REDUCTION AT BODIWAIT NOW YOU ALSO DO GET A DECLINE AND BEAMAR WHEN YOU LOSE WAY ONE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST IN A SMALLER BODY NOW AND SO IT TAKES LESS ENERGY TO A LOCAMOT A BUT ALSO THERE'S WHAT'S CALLED METBAL CAPTATION WHICH IS A FURTHER REDUCTION IN YOUR BAMAR THEN EXPECTED FROM THE LOSS OF BODY MASS AND THAT'S ON AVERAGE USUALLY ROUND LIKE FIFTEEN PER CENT BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE COMING OUT ON THE METABAL CAPTATION FROM BAMAR AND IT SEEMS TO BE A LILEBIT A KIND OF IN THE TRANSITION FASES SO IF YOU IF YOU START TO DIET WITHIN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS YOU WILL HAVE A REDUCTION AND BAMAR THAT THEN KIND OF JUST AF THEREAFTER ANY FURTHER REDUCTION IS MOSTLY FROM THE AMOUNT OF BODY MASS YOU LOSE AND THEN IF YOU LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FINISH O DIET MOVED YOUR CALLORIES TO MAINTENANCE A WITHIN A FEW WEEKS BEAMAR KIND OF STARTS TO COME BACK UP THERE IS STILL A SMALL REDUCTION A BUT I USED TO BE SOMEBODY WHO THOUGHT THE BAMAR YOU KNOW THE METABALCAAPTATION WAS A BIG REASON WHY PEOPLE STOPPED LOSING WAIT OR PLATEAUD AND NOW I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE TO DO WITH MEAT INTERESTING AND YOU'VE SAID THAT IT CAN'T BE CONSCIOUS AM BECAUSE THAT WILL DISTRACT US FROM OTHER ACTIVITIES I DON'T KNIF YOU'VE HAD CHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS STUDY AND I'LL SEND IT YOU MAY BE ID BE FUN TO DO A KIND OF AN ON LINE JEURNAL CLUB ABOUT THIS AT SOME POINT SUMEBUT THERE'S A STUDY IT CAME OUT A UNIVERS AUSED AN RECENTLY HAVING PEOPLE DO NOW THIS IS A LONG PERT OF TIME FOUR HOURS A DAY A BASELY A SOLELIEST PUSH UP WHICH MAY SEE A HEAL RAYS CAVE A SEEDED CALF RAYS WITH ONE WHO AT  NOT WAITED AND THEN THEY LOOKED IT A BUNCH OFTHINGS ABOUT LUCOS MATABOLISM AND GLUCOS CLEARANCE AND INSOLEN LEVELS AND THEY DIDN'T  CONCLUDE THAT PEOPLE BURNED TA TON OF CALLRIES BUT WHAT THEY CONCLUDED WAS THAT A BLOODSHUGER REGULATION IMPROVED GREATLY AND I THINK YOU KNOW TERE IS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THIS AM AT SOME LEVEL BUT BASE ON EVERYTHING YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS IT FITS PERFECTLY WITH WHAT'S KNOWN ABOUT MEAT SO THIS SORT FELLOW SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN WITH A IN BETWEENSCUS ME A TO AF DELIBERATE EXERCISE AND SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENT I GUSS THEY'VE TRYD TO MAKE THAT SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENT A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSCIOUS WHAT I'LL TELL PEOPLE AS IF IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT NEE ONE THING YOU CAN DO LIKE THESE WATCHES FOR EXAMPLE LI PEOPLE LIKE ALL WHAT TOLD ME I BURN THIS MANY CALLORIES THE THEY ARE NOT ACCURATE FOR ENERGY EXPENDITURE I MEAT IT IS LIKE THERE WAS A METANALYSIS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN I WONE TO SAY BETWEEN A WENTY EIGHT AND NINETY THREE PER CENT OVER ESTIMATION OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE BY THESE WATCH OT THIS ISTRACTS OVER THORSE ARE YOU LISTENING WHERE 'RE NOT  GETTO NAME THE BRAND BUT A FITNESS TRACKERS THAT'S A RIST WARN FITNESS TRAT AND THIS ITNESS IS ACROSS THE BOARD A SO  LIKE DEPENDING ON THE BRAND IT COULD BE BE KNOW MORE OR LESS BUT THEY ALL OVER ESTIMATED THE MOUNT OF EX THE CALLORIES YOU BURN FROM EXERCISE SO THIS IS ACTY A GREAT EXAMPLE WERKE PEOPLE GO WELL CALLORIES IN CALLORIES OUT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME CAUSE I AINTE TA CALLORYDEFFS ON I DIDN' LOOSE WEIGHT AN NO WHEN I TALK TO THEM USUALLY IT'S THEY WENT TO AN ALL MINE CALCULATOR IT'S ANE IS TO FEW THINGS THEY WENT TOHAN ALL I'M CALCULATOR PUT IN THEIR INFORMATION IT'S IT'SPAT OUT SOME CALLORIES TO EAT AND THEY AIT THAT N DEN LOOSE WEIGHT NIT'S LIKE WILL BUT HE THINKS MORE LIKELY THAT YOU'RE DEFYING THE LOSS OF YOU KNOW UM CONSURVATION OF ENERGY OR THAT YOU'R YOU MIGHT HAVE NOT GOT IN THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR YOU THE R THE MEASUREMENTUAL WAS OFF NO NOW THE NEXT THING IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WEIG VERYSPARATICALLY AND I'LL TELL PEOPLE LIKE IF YOU'RE GO TO MAKE AN INTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS OF GOAL UM AND AGAIN THIS CAN BE DIFFERENT FOR DIFFRENT PEOPLE BUT TYPICALLY I TELL PEOPLE WAIY AND FIRST THINGIN THE MORNING OR AFTER YO THE BATHROM DO IT EVERY DAY AND TAKE THE AVERAGE OF THAT FOR THE WEEK AND THEN COMPARE THAT TO THE NEXT WEEK'S AVERAGE CAN ASK ONE QRITSARYDAN TROU BUT WHENE GREAT QUESTION ABOUT THEM WEU SAY GO TO THE BATHROOM NOT TO GET UM AT YOU DETAILED I HER FOR UNNECESSARILY BETTER E TALKING ABOUT OURINATION AND  LAMITING YOUR BOWELS I HAV NEARLY BECAUE YOU GEATIN BIG MEAL THE NIGHT BEFORE YET YET GOT IT  SO WAKE UP I USE THE BATHROOM UM IN ALL ALL FORMS THAT TAT YOU READY AND THEN AND THEN GET ON THE SCALE TAKE THAT MEASUREMENT AVERAGE THAT ACROSS THE WEEK AND THEN MAYBE EVERY MONDAY YOU TAKE THAT VALUE Y AND THE REASON I I RECOMMEND DOING THAT IS IF YOU'RE JUST CONOSPARATICALLY WEIGHING IN AS SOMEBODY WHO WEIGHS THEMSELVES PRETTY PRETTY REGULARLY I MEW MY WEIGHT WITL FLUCTUATE YU KNOW FIVE SIX POUNDS AND NOT SEEMINGLY CHANGING MUCH YOU KNOW AND THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW THOSE SHORT TERM CHANGES ARE FLUID SO I I'VE HAD IT BEFORE WHERE WEEK TO WEEK MY AVERGE DIDN'T CHANGE BUT BETWEEN THE LOWEST WAY AND FROM A PREVIOUS WEEK AND THE HIGHEST WAIY IN MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE EIGHT POUNDS RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO JUST RANDOMLY IS WEIGHING IN AND YOU'RE EATING IN A CALLORY DEFICIT AND YOU JUST WEIG IN ONE DAY WHERE YOU'VE JUST WHATEVER REASON HOLDING SOME MORE FLUID THEN YOU OLL SEE THIS ISN'T WORKING WHEN A REALITY YOU'RE AVERAGE MIGHT BE DROPPING SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS AND ACTUALLY UM BELIEVE T ARE NOT A WEIGHT FLUCTUATIONS ARE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED IS A MAJYOUR REASON WHY PEOPLE GET DISCOURAGED FROM WEIGHT LOSS M THAT I KIND OF STOPS THE BUYIN YOU KNOW WHEN THEY AVE A FLUCTUATION UP SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS ARE EARLIN ONE OF REASONS EARLY ON THE LOW CARBDIETS TEND TO WORK REALLY WELLS CAUSE PEOPLE LOSE A LOT OF WATER WEIGHT REALLY QUICKLY AND THEY GET THAT BUYIN RIGHT TO ALL THIS IS WORKING OW WE CAN RETURN TO THAT NOLL BIT IHAVE THEORIES AS TO HOW THAT UM YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE EAT LESS CARBADRATE THEY SCREET MORE WATER AND THEY'LL SEE YOU KNOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY'LL SEE SOME DEFINITION IN THEI'R ABSEN O WE OT THO STIITS AMANZING  UM AND THE FLUID LOSS DOES HOLD THAT PROMISE I THINK FLUE LOSS CAN DO SOME OTHER THINGS ON MYT PEOPLE LIT  MAKE PEOPLE LITERALLY FEEL LIGHTER A ALL THE GAN I HAVE SOME NEGATIVE EFFECTS I DO EVER ONE QUICK QUESTION AND AND U I DO WANT WELL RETURN TO MET IN A MOMENT BUT WHEN YO SAY THE COLORIC BURN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF EXERCISE  WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE COLORIC BURN DURING THAT EXERCISE SOPERENCE AND SOMEBODIES ON THE TREAD MILL AND THEY'LL SEE OCAT THEY BURN IN FOUR HUNDRED CALLORIES ASH I THINK THIS IS A MONTH WHERE A NUMBER OF PROMINENT POD CASTERS LIKE BURT CRISER TOM CIGARA JO ROGUE AND OTHERS AND THEY CALLT SOBER OCTOBER BUT IN ADDITION TO AVOIDING A'LL CALL THEY THEY'RE BURNING FIVE HUNDRED CALLORIES PERDAY DURING THE EXERCI EVER MENT THEY'R MEASURING IT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THIS THEY THINK THEY TAKE TRACK OF WHETHER EXCUSE ME TAKE STOCK OF HOW MANY CALLORIES THEY BURNED MYI UNERSTANDING IS THAT IF THAT PARTICULAR FORM OF EXERCISE IS A MUSCLE BUILDING FORM OF EXERCISE THAT THAT' SOME POINT LATER THERE MIGHT BE AN INCREASE IN MUSCLE IF YOU DID IT EVERYTHING RIGHT YOU EVERYTHING RIGHT AND THEN YOU WILL BURN MORE ENERGY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF ADDING THAT TISSUE THAT'S A LONG PROCESSESS AS YOU KNOW AND WE WILL DISCUSS BUT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS POST EXERCISE INDUCED INCREASE IN OXIDATE OF METABOLISM IA PROBLY OT USING THE RIGHT A LANGUAGING HERE YOU SO IF I WERE TO GO OUT FOR INSTANCE ANCE SPRINT DOSOME SPRINC RUN HARD FOR A MINUTE JOG FOR A MINUTE RUN HARDFOR MEN DO THAT TEN TIMES OVER THEY LET'S ASSUE MY BURN FOUR HUNDRED CALLORIES DURING THAT A EXERCISE ABOUT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN THE HOURS THAT FOLLOW MY BAZIL METABOLIC RATE WILL HAVE INCREASED IS THAT TRUE AND IS IT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO CARE ABOUT SO ANSWER BOTH THOSE QUESTIONS A YES THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A SMALL INCREASE A IMETABOLIC RATE AND NO IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ENOUGH TO ACTION MAKE IT DIFFERENCE SO WHEN THEY LOOK AT AND AGAIN THIS IS WHERE A I TELL PEOPLE I THINK I'VE A GOOD PERSPECTIVE ON THIS BECAUSE I MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES ABOUT COMMISTER DEGREE SA IS VERY INTO MECHANISMS YOU DON'T IT MEAN IT WAS LIKE ALL IF WE JUST DO THIS AND THIS WILL GET THIS RIGHT AND THEN I DID NUTRICIAN IS A GRADUATE DEGREE AND THEN MY ADVISER WAS SO GREATE BECAUSE YOU COULD DO SOMETHING OVER HERE AND HE COULD TELL YOU HOW UL EFFECT VIDEM AN DE METABOLISM OVER HERIS IS GON LAME YE DON'T AMN SO YOU KNOW HE WOULD ALWAYS CAN SAY YHE HAVE WHAT'S THE OUTCOME GOOD TO BE RIGHT SO THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THINGS I CHANGE MY MIND ON WAS I USED TO BE VERY MUCH WHILE I THINK YOU KNOW HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING IS PROBABLY BETTER BECAUSE YOU GET THIS POST EXERCISE ENERGY BURN WHICH THEY DO SEE IN SOME OF THESE STUDIES BUT IN THE KIND OF META ANALYSIES AND LIKE MORE TIGHTLY CONTROLLED STUDIES WHERE THEY A QUAITE WORK BETWEEN HIGH INTENS INTERVALS AND MODER OR LOW INTENTSTY A CARDIO SO A QUATING WORK A THEY DON'T SEE DIFFERENCES IN THE LOSS OF BODY FAT AND SO TO ME IF I'M LOOKING IE THAT'S THE EXAMPLE OF A MECHANISM WHICH IS OCA WERE SEEING THIS SMALL INCREASE IN BASEMEN A BOLIC RATE THAT SHOULD LEAD TO INCREASED LOSS OF BODY FAT BUT AGAIN REMEMBER YOU'RE CAPTURING IT A SNAP SHOT IN TIME RIGHT BUT WE DON'T SEE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LOSS OF BODYFELT SO WHAT MAY BE HAPPENING AND AGAIN I'M JUST SPECULATING BUT A WAY TO EXPLAIN IT COULD BE YOU MIGHT HAVE AN INCR EASE ANDTHEN YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A DECREASE THE TENDS TO JUST CONNAL WASH IT OUT I AVE IMAGINE SOME FORMS OF EXERCISE THIS WOULD BE HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL BUT IM WE'LL SPIKE APPETITE MORE THAN OTHERS SO FER INSTANCE IF I GO OUT FOR A FORTY FIVE MINUTE JOG OR WHICH I DO O FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY MINUTE HIGKER JOG ONCE A WEEK I JUST MAKE IT APPOINT TO DO THAT OR RUCK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THROWN AWAY VAST AND HIKE AFTER THAT I FIND I A VERY THIRSTY I WANT TO HYDRATE BUT I'M NOT THAT HUNGRY THAT'S TRUE OF MOST ALL CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE FOR ME  BUT AFTER I WAIT TRAIN ABOUT SIXTY TO NINETY MINUTES LATER I WANT TO EAT THE REFRIGERATOR AND SO OBVIOUSLY CALLORIES IN CALLORIES OUT DICTATES THAT THAT WILL PLAY IN IMPORTANT ROLLAS TO WHETHER NOT I GAINERLOS WEIGHT ET CETERA SO IS IT SAFE TO SAY THAT THE SPECIFIC FORM OF EXERCISE THAT PEOPLE CHOOSE I NEEDS TO BE TAKE IN IN CONSIDERATION CALLORIES IN CALLORIES OUT TO HOW MUCH IS BURN DURING THE EXERCISE ALSO HOW MUCH THAT EXERCISE TENS TO STIMULATE APPETITE I NOT NOWITHER NOT PEOPLE EXPLORE THIS AND IN THE RIGOROUS STUDIES T AND WHETHER NOT THAT FORM OF EXERCISE ACTUALLY INCREASEIS LEAN MUSCLE MASS OR NOT IM IT'SO ID NOW WE TAKE AN EXERCISE AND SPLIT IT INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFENT DIMENTIONS BUT THIS IS WHAT I YOU ARE SO MASTERFUL AT IS REALLY PARCING HOW THE IFFERENT COMPONENTS WORK INDIVIDUALLY AND TOGETHER SO IF YOU WOULD JUST AM YOU KNOW EXPAND ON THAT I  LOVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING YET SO THIS IS ACTUALLY FASCINATING THING IM SO FIRST THING I WANT I WANTED JUST GO BACK TO TALKING ABOUT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE BURTON TOM AND AND JOE ER N TO FAFNER CALLORIES TO DAY ON WHATEVER ISO THOSE APPARATUSES DON'T MEASURE THOSE THINGS EFFECTIVELY EITHER RIGHT JUST LIKE THESE WATCHES BUT WEL THE ONE THING I WILL SAY IS IF YOU ARE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF I DO TO OURS RESISTANCE TRAINING TYPICALLY THIS WILL SAY D BURNED ABOUT A THOUSAND CALLERIES NOT'S A LOT OF RESISTANCTERMY WARY MIGH WAIGHT WORK OUTSELECTS ARE WARM UP FOR TEN MINUTES AND THEN ONE HOUR OF WORK DONE I JUST I LOVE TO TRAN OKAD IT'S AN AND YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MY RECOVERY QUOTION IS PRETTY LOW SO I'VE BEEN TRAINING FOR THIRTY PLUSS YEARS AND I'VE FOUND THAT IF I DO MORE THAN AN HOUR OF HARD WORK IN THE GEM MEANING RESISTANCE TRAIN IF SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES MAYBE OUT MOCAY BUT PASS THAT I HAVE TO TAKE TWO MAYBE EN THREE DAYS OFF BEFORE ANYTIN IN MY NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST DOESN'T TOLERATE IT WELL SO I I LIMINUTE TO AN HOUR I KNOW BUT AN HA THAT TO REMEMBER IS LIKE I'VE KIN O BUILT UP TO THAT OVER A LONG PET O TIME RIGHT ILL SO COULDN'T JUST POSE SOMEBODY IN THE STAR HAVEN DO TO OURS DAY AS NOCKING TO GO WELL FOR THEM I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ITHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED G ONE IS A VITE IM IN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATION OL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SO 'M DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE IS MY STARRY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATLETIC GREENS ONCE OR USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE I THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH IRE GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MEAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIATICS ANOUTH LETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION I LETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTESGRIT IF YOU LIKE TO TRY OTH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AND THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S ATLETIC GREEN STOC CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY A VITE EMIND THRE K TO BUT I WE'LL SAY ABOUT THE CALLORY TRACKERS IS SO IF I'M USED TO I USUALLY BURN ABOUT A THOUSAND CALORIES ACCORDING TO THIS IT'S NOT ACCURATE BUT IF I GO IN TO MORROW AND I DO THIRTEEN HUNDRED IT MAY NOT BE ACCURATE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT NUMBER IS BUT I CAN BE RELATIVELY CONFIDENT THAT IT'S MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS SESSION RIGHT AND SO IN TERMS OF COMPARISON IT MIGHT BE O K LIKE YOU NON'T CONE UT WITHIN SUBJECT A AND IN THE OTHER THING I KON A CIRCLE AROUND I WAS IF YOU WE'RE NOT NEAT TRACKING YOUR STEPS CAN BE HELPFUL BECAUSE PEOPLEILL STEP COUNTS CAN SPONTANEOUSLY DECREASE WHEN NONE A FAT LOST I THAN EV REALIZE IT SO AAND AND THAT AGAIN NOT A COMPLETE MEASURE OF NEAT BUT WHAT WE'VE HAD SOME CLIENTS TO WET ARE TEE MILING COACHES IS THEY'LL SAY O KAY YOUR AT EIGHT THOUSAND STEPS RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADD ANY PURPOSEFUL CARDIO BUT WHAT EVER YOU NEED TO DO TO MAINTAIN THAT EIGHT THOUSAND STEPS DO THAT AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO ADD YOU KNOW FIFTEEN TWENTY THIRTY MINUTES OF CARDIO BECAUSE THEIR SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY THAT DHEY'RE NOT EVEN WHERE OF GOES DOWN THAT'S A REALLY EXCELLENT POINT AT I I'VE HEARD YOU NO THE TEN THOUSAND STEPS PER DAY NUMBER WAS A WE ALL HEARD THAT AND THEN I LEARNED THAT TEN THOUSAND S CON O THROWN OUT AS IN AR TRERY NUMBER SO ERLISE ATGT HOUR INTERMIT IN FASTINGTHING THAT IS A STORY BEHIND THAT ISH A SPOKE TO SOUCH IN AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE GRADUATE STUDENT IN IS LABE THAT DID THAT INITIAL STUDY WHICH WAS ON MY BY THE WAY A WAS LIMITED TO BEING IN LAB FOR A BOUT EIGHT HOURS BY THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER SO THE EIGHT HOUR FEETING WINDOW AS ACTUALL THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PERSON'S RELATIONSHIP A THAT IS THAT IS A REALLY GREAT POINT THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHEN THEY A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL TRY TO COPY LIKE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES AND I'L I'LL TELL PEOPLE THAT LESSEN SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ARE SO CONFINED YOU YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH HOW BROADLY YOU APPLY WHAT'S IN THERE RIGHT LIKE THER THEY'RE A VERY BIG HAMMERS THE KOND  THE WAY A LOOK AT IT O KA THEY'RE NOT A SCOWPL THEYR BIG HAMMER AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES AN TERMS OF COACHING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WILL TELL YOU WHAT NOT TO DO RATHER THAN WHAT TO DO RIGHT IL BE GETTING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT LIKE EXERCISE APPETITE SO FIRST IF I'M NOT REALLY AWARE IF THERE'S AEVIDENT SHOWING LIKE DIFFERENTIAL EFFACTS OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXERCISE ON APPETITE IT'S POSSIBLE AM BUT AGAIN IT ALSO COULD BE LIKE A PLUCIBO EFFACT RIGHT BECAUSE WE LIKE FOR SAMPLE YOU AND I GREW UP IN AN AIR A WITH A MUSCLE MAGAZINES IT WAS LIKE WELL SOON AS YOU FINISH YOUR WORK OUT YOU'O HVE YOUR BIGGEST MEAL THE DAY RIGHT AND YOU KNOW WHEN I SAY PLUCIBO EFFACT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE THE WRONG IDEA WHAT THE PLUCIBO EFFECT IS THEY THINK THAT'S JUST A FEELING PLUSIBO EFFACT CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE YOUR PHYSIOLOGY PEOPLE DON'T PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS A THERE'S RESEARCH SHOWING THAT A PLUCIBO WHERE THE POWER OF SUGGESTION IS BASICALLY AS POWERFUL AS SOME FORMER SUITACLES AND ONE OF THE THE GREAT EXAMPLES I LIKE TO USE IS ICTUL T WAS A STUDY WE JUST COVERED IN OUR RESEARCH FOR VIEW ON CREATON WHERE THEY DID AM FOUR GROUPS NOT SUPPLEMENT WITH CREATSAN TOLD THEY WEREN'T SUPPLEMENT OF CREATON NOT SUPPLEMENTED TOLD THEY WERE SUPPLEMENTED SUPPLEMENTED TOLD THEY WERE SUPPLEMENTED TOLD THEY WERE THASICALLY IT JUST MATTERS WHAT THEY TOLD THEM REALLY GO U THIS IS INCREDIBLE AM I HAVE TO GET THIS STUDY WO IT'S SO WE CAN LINK TO  A COLLEGUE OF MINE THAT STAMBERSHE'S BEEN ON THE POD CASTS I LOVE INTRODUCE YOU TO CAUSE I THINK HE IS WE A REALLY REAR FIRST ROUT SHE WAS A FORMER DE ON ATHLE AM AND THEN IS A IT RUNS A LABAT TAMPERIN PSYCHOLOGY IS IS A LEACRUM AND SHE'S AN GRUP AM IT IN THES YOU KNOW VERY ATHLETIC OBVIOUSLY AND VERY VERY SMART AND HER LABORATORY FOLKSES ON THESE BELIEF SLASH PLUCIBO EFFACTS WHERE IF YOU TELL PEOPLE ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT STRASTS DUE TO YOU INTERMS YOUR MEMORY AND COGNANT FUNCTIONING THEY GIVE THEM A MEMORYTAS THEY THEYD PERFORM WELL BELO BASELINE  YOU TELL THEM THAT STRASS SHARPENS THEM IN THE SHORT TERM AND THAT IT DRANALIN IS THIS POWERFUL MOLECULE THAT CAN A REALLY TUNE OUT BY NUMBER OF MEMORY SYSTEMS MEMORY IMPROVES AND IT MINTS REMARKABLE AM AND IT'S CONSISTENT AND A AND THIS END THEYVE DONE THIS FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN ANAGAN EASLE WOD OLERGIES FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW IT INCREDIBLE RESULTS IN ANY CASE I I'M I' SO GLAD YOU'RE BRINGING THE SOUT M I TAKE CREATING MONOHIDRATE A AND HAVE FOR YEARS FIVEGRAMS A DAY I DON'T NAT'S GREAT AND AM AND IT'S GREAT AND I BELIEVE IT'S GRATES SO IT NER COMPOUND OFFACT OF BELIEVING ITS GREAT AND IT ACTUALLY SO NIGH NOT IN THIS STUDY BUT SO I THINK THE THING TO POINT OUT PEOPLE WILL MISINTERPRET THAT AS CREATON DOESN'T WORK AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT SAYS WHAT IT SAYS IS YOURE BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT IT DOES ARE PROBABLY JUST AS POWERFUL AS WHAT IT DOES RIGHT SO THEY'D ACTULY TO A STUDY  DON'T HAVE THE CITATION BUT IT WAS THINK WITHIN LAST TEN YEARS WHER THEY TOLD PEOPLE THEY WERE PUTTNG THEM ON ANIBAL EXTEROIDS AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT THEY HAD BETTER GAINS EVEN THOUGH THEY WEREN'T ACTUALY ON ANIBAL EXTEROIDS THEY HAD BETTER GAINS THAN PEOPLE THAT THEY DIDN'T TELL EREAND OFOXTEROIDS AND THAT'S LIKE HARD OUT COME STRENGTH LEAN BODY MASTS O THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY WELL I WOULDN'T FALT FOR THE PLUCIBO EFFACT ITS LIKE EH YOU DON'T HAVE TO FALL FOR IT IF IF YOU BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE THE POWER OF BELIEF IS VERY VERY POWERFUL AND AS A SCIENTIST I WISH SOMETIMES I WAS IGNORANT SO THAT I COULD SUBJECT MYSELF TO LITTLE SEE BEFECT MORE OFTEN AV SOME RAM SO KIND OF GETTNG BACK TO THAT'S JUST A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF MAYBE WHY YOU KNOW AND I'M TH SAME WAY LIKE I GET DON WITH A WORK OUT I C RESIST THE TRAITING SESSION LIKE AMREAD TO EAT IGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE OVER ALL ON EXERCISE AN APPETITE IT'S NOT ALWAYS WHAT YOU'D EXPECT CONSISTENTLY IT SEEMS TO SHOW THAT EXERCISE EXTUALLY HAS AN APPETITES SUPPRESSENT EFFECT SO A PEOPLE DON'T TEND A COMPENSATE AT LEAST FULLY FOR THE AMOUNT OF MOVEMENT THEY DO AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOU'VE PROBLY HEARD PEOPLE SAY WHAT EXERCISE A REALY POOR WEIGHT LOSS TOOL RIGHT LIKE IT LIKE IF YOU FIGURE OUT HOW MANY CALORIES YOU SHOULD BE BURNING FROM IT AND YOU DO THAT YOU AN UP GETTING LESS WEIGHT LOSS THAN YOU THEN YOU WOULD PREDICT HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS PERFECTLY HAPPEN TO EAT LEST BUT DOESN'T LOATHE EXERCISEBA DISLIKE SEXORS YEAND THEY AND THERE OF HEALTHY WEIGHT BUT I'M ALWAYS ENCOURAGING THEM TO EXERCISE MORINECICISN ON GOING BATTLE IN UR IN OUR SIBBLING RELATIONSHIP WELL ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT EXERCISE INDEPENDENT OF ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS WITH YOUR BODYWEIGHT YOU WILL BE HALTHIER SO EXERCISE IS ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS WILL ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR BILE MARKERS OF HEALTH WITHOUT EVEN LOSING WEIGHT SO THERE'S LIKE IT IT PROVE YOUR INSELLENT SENSTIVITY INFLAMMATION ALL THAT STOF SO EVER BIH OUT THERE LOOKING FOR A HACK TO BE HEALTHIER EXERCISE IS THE HACK RIVESHAL POINT AND OUR AM A MUTUAL FRIEND DOCTOR PETER TO A THIN HAS GONE ON RECORD SEVERAL TIMES NOW SAYING THAT OF ALL THE THINGS THAT ONE COULD TAKE AND A MEN ET CETERA MET FORMIN OF A EGARD US OF WHEATHER NOT ONE TAKES THOSE OR DOESN'T TAKE THOSE THAT THE POSIVE EFFECTS ON ON GEVITY BY WAY OF BAR BY MARKERS FROM REGULAR EXERCISE IS YOU KNOW FAR OUT WAIYS ALL OF THOSE THINGS COMBINE NOT THAT THOSE THINGS DON'T NECESSARILY WORK WE'RE NOT GOING THROUG THEM IN DETAIL NOW BUT THAT EXERCISE IS BY FAR THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR HEALTSPAN IN LIFE SPANDION ABSOLUTELY I HUNDRPERCENT AGREE AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS PEOPLE MISS THE POINT OF EXERCISE I THINK YETHERE'S SOME WORTH THAT CAME OUT FROM A HERMIN PONSERS WELL THAT BASELY SHOWED LIKE WELL IF YOU DO A HUNDRED CALORIES FROM EXERCISE YOU HAVE A LIKE TWENTY EIGHT CALORY REDUCTION IN YOUR BASOL METABOLIC RATE IN A RESPONSE TO THAT SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE THIS CONSTRAINED ENERGY EXPENDITURE MODEL RIGHT BUT WHAT I WOULD SAYSE IOK CAN WLTE TARE STILL A NET OF SEVENTY TOO RIGHT SO ITS STILL IT'S STILL O KA AND THE OTHER THING IS I THINK THE EFFECTS OF EXERISE ON WEIGHT LOSS AR ACTUALLY MORE DUE TO WHAT IT DOES TO APPETITE A SO IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO LOSE WEIGHT AND KEEP IT OFF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS KIND OF OUTLIERS BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T KEEP IT OFF FOR YEARS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEM ENGAGE IN REGULAR EXERCISE OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KEEP WEIGHT LOSS LIKE MAINTAIN WEIGT LOSS LESS THAN THIRTY PER CENT EXERCISE REGULARLY SO NOW THAT'S JUST A CORRELATION THAT DOESN'T ES PROVE CAUSATION BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY COMPELLING STUDIES SHOWING THAT EXERCISE INCREASES YOUR SENSITIVITY TO SOCIETY SIGNALS SO BASELY YOULD HAVE THE SAME SITIETY SIGNALS BUT YOU'RE MORE SENSITIVE TO THEM WHEN YOU EXERCISE AND THERE'S ACTUYA REALLY CLASSIC STUDY IM FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND BEEN GOLLY WORKERS WHERE THEY LOOKED AT BASICALLY FOUR DIFFERENT QUADRANTS OF ACTIVITY SUHED SEDENTRY LIGHTLY ACTIVE MODERATELY ACTIVE HEAVILY ACTIVE BASELY BASE ON O THEIR JOB CHOICE AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN INTERVENTION THEY JUST ONE DETRACT THEM AN AND SEE HOW MUCH YOU NW HOW MANY CALORIES TO THE ACTUALLY EAT SO IT WAS LIKE A JAY SHAPED CURVE SO THE SEDENTARY ACTUALLY ATE MORE FOOD THAN THE LIGHTLY ACTIVE ARE MODERATELY ACTIVE BUT FROM LIGHTLY ACTIVE TO HEAVILY ACTIVE THEY ALMOST PERFECTLY COMPENSATED HOW MANY CALORIES THEY SHOULD BE EATING SO TO ME THAT SUGGESTS WHEN YOU BECOME ACTIVE YOU CAN ACTUALLY REREGULATE YOUR APPETITE APPROPRIATELY OR MUCH MORE APPROPRIATELY THAN IF YOU'R EDENTARY AND DO YOU THINK THIS HAS TO DO WITH CHANGES IN THE BRAIN BRAIN CENTERS THAT RESPOND TO SOCITY SIGNALS FROM THE PRIFRY AM AND OR DO YOU THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH A CHANGES IN RT BLOOD SUGAR REGULATION  WHAT I WAS TAUGHT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS NL CONSER TRUE IS THAT NOW SPIKES IN BLOOD SUGAR WILL TRIGGAR OR DESIRE TO EAT MORE EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOT OF EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE WHAT YOU NEED WHEN YOU HAVE A SPIKING BLOOG SUGAR AND THERE'S THIS KIND OF AND WILL GET INTO THIS OINT OUK ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS THIS HIS IDEA IN MIND I THINK I ADOPTED PERHAPS FALSELY THAT NOW EAT SOMETHING THAT SWEETER THAT TASTES REALLY GOOD AND AND YOU ARE SUDDENLY ON THE TRAIN OF WANTING TO EAT MORE AM AND I CAN IMAGINE HOW EXERCISE AM IF IT IS INCREASING THE SOCIETY SIGNALS A COULD BE WORKING IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS YE I I THINK IT'S AM I THINK THE EFFECT IS PROBABLY MOSTLY AT THE BRAIN LEVEL AM YOU KNOW THAT THE EFFECTS ON BLOOD SUGAR THE RESEARCH OUT THERE IS NOT VERY COMPELLING FOR BLOOD SUGAR DRIVING A APPETITE NOW IF YOU BECOME HYPOGLY SEEMAC YES YOU'LL YOU'LL GET HUNGARY BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF HUNGER THEN LIKE YOUR NORMAL LIKE I FEEL CON EMPTY AND MY STOMACHS GROWLING LIKE THOSE ARE THEY CAN GO TOGETHER BUT USUALLY LIKE THE HYPOGLY SEEM IS LIKE I AM HOT I FEEL LIKE HMN TO PASS OUT LIKE YOU WANT IT EATS SOMETHING NOT BECAUSE YOUR STOMACH CROWLING BUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT YOU JUST NEAT SOME FUEL S LIKE YOURE ETTING COLD UNDER OH YE ASUALLIIMERE BEEN THERE WHEN IVE A THEN LONGER FAST SOMETHING I DON'T DO ANY MORE AND DRANK A LOT OF BLACK COFFEE THOS PROBABLY AN ELECTROLIGHT EFFECT THER BECAUSE COFFEE AS YOU EXCREETE SODO HIM ANOTHER ELECTROLITES AND THEN JUST FEELING LIKE I NEEDED SOMETHING THIS WHOLE THING LIKE I NEED SOMETHING HAS HAVE DESPERATION AND I NEVER WANT TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN HYPROGRISE THENG MAN IS VERY ON UT'S NOT FUN SO YOU KNOW AGAIN WHEN THEY ANY WHEN THEN WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOU NOW ACTUAL RANDOMIZE CONTROL TRIALS OF IMPLEMENTING SOME EXERCISE WERE THERE YOU KNOW PRETTY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT THEY TYPICALLY SEE PEOPLE IF IF ANYTHING THEY EAT LESS AS SUPPOSED TO EATING MORE NOW SOME PEOPLE AGAIN THAT'S U KNOW STUDIES REPORT AVERAGES RIGHT AND THERE'S INDIVIDUAL DATA POINTS SO THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO AT LEAST ANECDOLLY REPORT THAT EXERCISE MAKES THEM WERE HUNGRY THAT'S COMPLETELY VALID IT'S NOW IT COULD BE THE'RE BELIEVE SURROUNDED IT COULD BE OF NUMBER DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS INDIVIDUAL VERIABILITY AND I THINK ONE O THE THINGS THAT I'VE LEARN TO APPRECIATE MORE IS NOT TRYING TO SEPARATE PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY WE'D WE DO THIS A LOT ITSO WHIL WONE TNOUG THE PHYSIOLOGY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF IT AND NOW I'M KIND OF APPRECIATING MORE PSYCHOLOGY IS PHYSIOLOGY YOU KNOW THAT LIKE WITH MOST THINGS NOW WE HAVE KIND OF THE BIO PSYCHO SOCIAL MODEL AND I'L GIVE AN EXAMPLE THIS LOT OF PEOPLE GET REALLY CAUGHT UP WITH APPETITE AND IF WE COULD JUST SUPPRESS PEOPLE'S APPETITE THAT'S PART OF IT BUT PEOPLE DON'T JUST EE CAUSE THE'R HUNGRY THET FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS SOCIAL REASONS ESPECIALLY SO CAN YOU REMEMBER THE LOST SOCIAL EVENT Y EVER WENT TO THE DIDN'T HAVE FOOD RIGHT IE YOU LOOK A DINNER PLATES FROM THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS ABOUT THIS BIG NOW HOW BEGGER DINNER PLATES THE WHOLE OFFAY RI RITA IM IF YOU THERE'S A SITUATIONAL CUES RIGHT YOUR STTING DOWN TO WATCH T T O GRABSON POPCORN GRAB SOME YOU KNOW SNACK WHATEVER I EVEN SEE THIS WITH THAT YOU KNOW HOW I ONE PERSONAL PICK UP THE PHRON AND THEN EVER ONET PIKS UP THEIR FON I THINK THERE'S A SIMILAR EFFECT WITH FOOD YNO AND AND SAME THING RIGHT LIKE HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE EITHER DONE IT OURSELVES OR BEEN A EXPERIENCE PEOPLE SAYING OWE SHOULD HAVE SOME YOU SHOULD HAVE T LIE LIKE YOU KNOW ATOUT CALL SPECIALLY RIGHT LIKE PEOPLE A I WAS SAYING OUT OF SOMEBODY LAST NIGHT AND I HAD A BEER AND THEY JUST HAD YOU KNOW A WATER AND I'M LIKE I FEEL NOW NEED TO TRY AND CONVINCE THEM TO DO THAT WITH ME YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BUT AS HUMANS YOU KNOW WE'RE WERE KIND OF HURT ANIMALS LIKE WE DON'T WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING OUT AN ISOLATION O OUR OWN NOW I THIS IS A VERY TINUOUS I GUESS BELIEF OF MINE BUT YOU KNOW DOING THINGS ALONE IN ISOLATION YOU KNOW DURING KIND OF YOU KNOW ANCESTRAL TIMES THAT'S GOING TO SET OFF YOUR ALARM SYSTEM YOU KNOW CAUS IF YOU DON'T HAVE OTHER PEOPLE YOU CAN'T PROTECT YOURSELF RIGHT SO TYPICALLY THINGS WERE DONE TOGETHER IN GROUPS AND I THINK THAT'S THA LOT OF THE REASON WHY WE TEND TO BE JUST TRIBLE IN NATURE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT SO THE WHOLE POINT TO THAT IS YOU KNOW ON THE LIST OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE EAT ME I'VE GOTTEN THE POI WHERE I THINK THAT HUNGER IS ACTUALLY NOT EVEN THE MAIN REASON PEOPLE EAT I STRESS AH LACKASLEEP ORD UM BORD UM YE ABSOLUTELY SO UNLESS YOU KNOW WE CAN DO SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSIS ALL THOSE THINGS AH THIS THAT THERE'S A LINE FROM A REVIEW PAPER THIS REVIEPEVER CAME OUT TWO THOUSAND ELEVENS BY RESEARCH OR AME AC CLEAN AND IT'S THE BEST REVIEW PAPER I'VE EVER READ I WAS CALLED ABIOLOGY'S RESPONSE TO DIETING THE IMPETUS FOR WEIGHT REGAIN AND BASELY WENT THROUGH ALL THE MECHANISMS OF THESE ADITATIONS THAT HAPPENED DURING FAT LOST DIETS AND HOW BIOLOGY'S RESPONSE IS TO TRY TO DRIVE YOU BACK TO YOUR YOURE PREVIOUS AND I'M IN A BUTCHER THO QUOTE BUT AT THE END OF THE STUDY HE SAID BASICALLY THE BODIES SYSTEMS ARE COMPREHENSIVE REDUNDANT AND WELL FOCUSSED ON RESTORING TO PLEADED ENERGY RESERVES AND ANY ATTEMPT OR AN KIND OF STRATEGY FOR WEIGHT LOSS THIT DOESN'T ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF THESE THINGS IS GOING TO FAIL AND SO THAT'S WHY WHEN PEOPLE SAY WILL JUST DO LOW CARB YOU WON'T BE HUNGRY MU YOUEVE IT PEOPLE DON'T JUST EAT BECAUSE THEY'RE HUNGRY SO I THINK REALLY LIKE TRYING TO GET OUTSIDE THE BOX AND AND THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU READ SOME OF THE LITTER TRIED I RECENTLY READ A A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF SUCCESSFUL WEIGHT LOST MAINTAINERS WHICH I HOUGHT WAS REALLY INTERESTING AH SO THEY TOOK PEOPLE WHO HAD LOST TO SIGNIFICANT AOUT OA BODYWEIGHTN'T KEPT IT OFF FIRS FOR I THINK IT HIS THREE YEARS AND IT MASELY ASKED HIM QUESTIONS AND TRIED TO IDENTIFY COMMONALITIES AND THERE WERE SOME THINGSTHAT I EXPECTED LIKE COGNATIVE RESTRAINT SELF MODITERING AH I YOU KNOW EXERCISE AND THEN ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAD THAT I FOUND REALY FASCINATING WAS PRETTY YOU BIQUITISTS BETWEEN PEOPLE THEY SAID I HAD TO DEVELOP A NEW IDENTITY SO YOU ARE YOU SEAR WITH ETHEN SIMPLY NO SO ETHEN IS A ACTOR HE'S BEEN LIKE REMEMBER THE TITANS AND A AMERICAN HISTORY AX I CERTAINLY SAW AMERICAN HISTORY EX YES SO HE WAS HE WAS VERY LARGE LIKE HE WAS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS AND NOW HE'S LIKE TOO THIRTY AND JACKE BUT YOU ILIFI HE WAS HOW FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS WELL AH AND HE HASE WHENEVER HE PUTS UP POST ON HIS INSTOGRAM OF HIM TRAINING IT'LL SAY I KILLED MY CLONE TO DAY AND I ASKED HIM LIKE IS THIS WHIT YOURE TALKING ABOUT LIKE CREATING A NEW IDENTITY HE SAID THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I HAD TO KILL WHO I WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOIG T BE ABLE TO MAKE LONG TERM CHANGES IF I JUST DIDN'T BECOME A NEW PERSON BECAUSE THERE'S I MEAN AN ATTICS TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT LIKE AM PEOPLE WHO WERE ALCHOLICS THEY HAD TO GET NEW FRIENDS THEY HAD TO HANG OUT AT DIFFERENT PLACES BECAUSE THEIRE ENTIRE LIFE HAD BEEN SET UP A ROUND THE SLIFE STYLE FOR ALCOHOL AND I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT EATING DISORDERS OR DISORDIRING PATTERNS IS MUCH HARDER TO BREAK THEN OTHER FORMS OF EDICTION AND HE ABOUT FOOD EDICTION WELL IN SOME WAYS BELEMIA AND AND ARERECY ARE STILL ADDICTIONS YOU CAN'T STOP EATING I YOU'RE ALCOHOLIC YOU CAN ABSTAIN FROM ALCOHOL IF YOU BECOME ADDICTED TO PSYCOCANE YOU CAN ABSTAIN FROM THAT YOU CAN NEVER ABSTAIN FROM FOOD AND SO NOW IMAGIN TONGUE OF GAMBLING ATTICT WELL YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY THE SLOT IN A COUPLE TIMES TO DAY BUT NO MORE LIKE THAT'S THAT'S REALLY CHALLENGING SO UM YET I JUST LIKE ALL THIS STUFF IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE COMPREHENSIVE WITH HOW WE TREAT THESE THINGS I THESE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POINTS AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE I DON'T THINK ANY ONE HAS REALLY DESCRIBED IT IN A COHESIVE WAY THE WAY THAT YOU'RE DOING HERE SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS BECAUSE IVAS SE IS A NERO SCIENTISTS I THINK NOOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS CREATING OUR THOUGHTS OUR THOUGHTS ARE AND FEELINGS ARE RELATE TO PSYCHOLOGY AND THEREFORE OF COURSE OUR PHYSIOLOGY IN OUR PSYCHOLOGY ARE ONE IN THE SAME SBY DIRECTIONAL NOW THERE'S NOWDAYS HERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN BRAIN BODY IN PATICULAR GOT BRING A ACCESS AND WE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOUR SPELLING OUT HOW THERE ARE THESE DIFERENT VARIABLES EACH ONE CAN ACCOUNT FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFENT THINGS EXERCISE CLEARLY HAS A REMARKABLY POTENT TO FACT BOTH DURING THE EXERCISE AND TRMS OF COLORIC WERN OVER ALL HEALTH AND BILE MARKERS AND THEN UM THIS IS WONDERFUL TO LEARN THAT IT CAN INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY TO A TO SOCIETY SIGNALS I THINK THAT MAKE AT LEAST MY MIND PLACE IS VERY HIGH ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DO BUT THAT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS TOO UM AND THE IDENTITY PIECE IS FASCINATING UM IT REMINDS ME ALSO YOUR STORY REMINDS ME ALSO A DAVIGOGINS WHO IS LYU YOU DON'T HE TALKS ABOUT HIS FORMER VERY OVERWEIGHITSELF ALMOST AS IF IT WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON UM AND HE USES LANGUAGE THAT I'M NOT ANY USEEERE YOUI'VE INMET DAVID KNOW DAVID A BEND HE'S HE'S EVERY BIT IS INTENSE AND DRIVEN AS AND REMARKABLE HUMAN BEING AS HE APPEARS TO BE AON LINE HE IS THAT GUY UM BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE HE HAD TO MOR LESS KILL OFF OF A FORMER VERSION OF HIMSELF AND AND CONTINUES TO DO THAT EVERY DAY AND I THINK IT WHT YOUR POINT ABOUT THAT THIS OTHER FELLOW WHO DID U DOES IT DOES IT THROUGH A SIMILAR PROCESS I THE WORD TO DAY SEEMS TO REALLY MATTER IT'S NOT LIKE YOU A DEFEAT THIS FORMER VERSION OF YOURSELF AND THEN THAT THAT THAT PERSON IS BURIED AND GONE YOU SAID YOU KNOW I KILLED MY CLONE TO DAY AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT DAVID TALKS ABOUT IT ALSO SO THIS IS A DAILY PROCESS AND I THINK UM THIS IS NOT JUST A SMALL DETAIL IN TING TOGETHER ALL THESE THINGS I THINK THAT WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS IS FUNDAMENTAL BECAUSE WE CAN PULL ON EACH ONE OF THESE VARIABLES AND TALK ABOUT EACH ONE OF THEM BUT THE OTHER DAY WEARE COHESIVE WHOLE AS IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL IN I'M A SORRY YOU RE US  T GETS THAT'S GASAXIONO EM I MY FAVORITE TOPICS WHICH IS OU KNOW WHY DO WE HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME WITH LOSING WEIGHT BUT MORE SO KEEPING IT OFF BECAUSE OF O BEAST PEOPLE SIX OUT OF EVERY SEVEN O BEAST PEOPLE WILL LOSE THE SIGNIFICANT ABOUT A BODYWEIGHT IN THEIR LIFE SO WHY DO WE STELFEN O BEASTY PROM THEY DON'T KEEP IT OFF WHY DON'T THEY KEEP IT OFF WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REE SEARCH BASICALLY WHAT IT SUGGESTS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT I AM GOING TO DO A DIET AND WHEN  LOSE THIS WEIGHT AND THEY DO NOT GIVE ANY THOUGHT TO WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS RIGHT IT'S LIKE THINK ABOUT IF YOU HAVE SOME CANOCHRONIC DISEASE R A DIBAK RIGHT YOU YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE INSOLENT ONCE AND THAT'S IT RIGHT YOU GOT IT TAKE IT CONTINUOUSLY OTHER WISE YOU'RE GOINGTO HAVE PROBLEDMS I'M IF YOU DO A DIET AND YOU LOSE YOU KNOW THIRTY POUNDS FANTASTIC BUT IF YOU THEN JUST GO BACK TO ALL YOUR OLD HABITS YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE IF NOT MORE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T CREATE A NEW VERSION OF YOURSELF WHILE DRAGGING YOUR OLD HABITS AND BEHAVIOURS BEHIND YOU SO WHAT I'LL TELL PEOPLE IS AS PEOPLE SAY WHAT I'M DOING A CART OF WOR DIET OR I'M DOING THIS DIET OR THAT DIET AND I'LL SAY THAT'S FINE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF DOING THAT FOR THE REST O YOUR LIFE AND IF THE ANSWERS YES IF YOU IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S CON TO BE STALED FOR YOU AND PLENTY PEOPLE LO CARB ANDR MENT FASTING WHAT WHATEVER THEY SAY UP FELT EASY YOU NOW I COULD DO THIS FOREVER GREAT WHAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE WEIGHT YOU HAVE TO INVOKE SOME FORM OF RESTRICTION WHETHER IT IS A NEUTRIENT RESTRICTION LIKE LOW CAR LO FAT A TIME RESTRICTION INTEREMENT FASTING ANY FORMER TIME RESTRICTED EATING OR CALON RESTRICTION TRACKING MACK ROS WHATEVER SO  YOU GET YOU GET TO PICK THE FORM OF RESTRICTION SO PICK THE FORM OF RESTRICTION THAT FEELS THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE TO YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND ALSO DO NOT ASSUME THAT IT WILL FEEL THE SAME FOR VERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE I MADE THIS MISTAKE WHERE'S LIE I I TRACK THINGS SO I I ALLOW MYSELF TO EAT EVERITY FOODS I ALLOW MYSELF TO EAT SOME FUN FOODS A BUT I TRACK EVERYTHING AND I'M ABLE TO MODIFY MY BODY COMPOSITION ON BEING GOOD HEALTH DOING THAT NOW DOESN'T FEEL HARD FOR ME AT PART OF IT'S I'VE JUST BEEN DOING IT FOR SO LONG BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT'S VERY STRESTFUL THEY DON'T WANT TO THEY SA WI'D RATHER JUST NOT EAT FOR WE KNOW SIXTEEN HOURS IF THAT FELLS EASY FOR THEM DO THAT BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT THERE IS A COUPLE OF METANALYSIS ON A POPULAR DIETS AND BASTELEY WHAT THEY SHOWED WAS THEYARE ALL EQUALLY TERRIBLE FOR FOR LONG TURM WEIGHT LOSS BUT WHEN THEY STRATIFIED THEM BY ADHERENTS AND NONE OF THEM WERE BETTER FOR ADHERENT OVER ALL BUT WHEN THEY STRATIFIED PEOPLE JUST ACCORDING FROM LOWEST ADHERENTS TO BEST ADHERENTS IT WAS A LINEAR OF FACT ON WEIGHT LOSS SO REALLY WHAT IT SAYS IS WHAT IS THE DIET THAT'S GOING TO BE EASIEST FOR YOU TO ADHERE TO IN THE LONG TERM AND YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO THAT AND PEOPLE AGAIN THIS IS WHERE I STEP BACK AND TAKE THE TEN THOUSAND FOOT VIEWU SOMEBODY'LL SAY WHAMUL DO KITO GENIC BECAUSE I WANT INCREASE MY FAT OCIDATION AND I WANT TO DO THIS ANDTHERE TALKING ALWAYS MECHANISMS AN EVERYTHING AND THAT'S GREAT CAN YOU DO IT FOR THRUST YOUR LIFE RIGHT IS THAT IS THIS GOING O BE SOMETHING SUSTAINABLE FOR YOU AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO YOU PROBABLY NEED TO RETHINK WHAT YOUREPROACHES GON TO BE IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE UM BASICALLY THAT YOU KNOW BY THET HIGH LIGHTN IF THERE WAS A AVERSION OF HIGHLIGHT OR BOLD FACE AND UNDERLINE IN A IN THE PODCAST FACE I I WOULD HIGHLIGHT BOLLFACE AND UNDERLINE WHAT YOU JUST SAID UM AND FOR THOSE HOF YEUTH HEARD IT I LISTEN TO IT TWICE AND THEN GO FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S ABSOLUTELY KEY I THINK IT ALSO EXPLAINS A LOT OF THE SO CALLED CONTROVERSY THAT EXISTS OUT THERE I THINK AM IT ALSO CROSSES OVER WITH THE PLACIBO EFFECT I ALMOST WANT TO SAY UM PICK THE THE NUTRICIAN PLAN THAT YOU THINK YOU CAN A STICK TO FOR FOR A LONG PERITIFE TIME I DEALLY FOREVER AND PICTURE PLACIBO TOO BECAUSE THERE'S THERE IS A LOT UP WITH SIBO WOVEN IN T EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS INTEREMENT FASTING A KITO PROBABLY EVEN UM VICAN VERSES OMINABORIVERSIS CARNIVOR WELL EVEN TALK ABOUT UM YOU KNOW THE DIET HONEYMOON PERIOD IT WER LIKE YOU GO INTO A DIET YOU'RE ALL FIRED UP ABOUT IT LIKE YOUR VERIAT HERIT AND IN WHAT HAPPENS WITH EVERY SINGLE DIET WITHOUT EXCEPTION IN RESEARCH STUDIES IS ONCE YOU GET PAST A FEW MONTHS ATHERENTS TO STARTS WAITING SO THITN' GOIN OFF HERE WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT A FORM OF RELATIONSHIP YOU KNOW I'M NOT ID NOT SAING THAT TO BE TONGUE IN CHEEK ACTUALL WE HAD A GUEST EARLY ON IN THE PODCAST DOCTOR CALLE DICEROTH HE'S A PSYCHITRIS AND U'M BY ENGINEER AT STAMPFORED AM TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL LASKER A WORD WINTER ET CETERA AND HE TALKED ABOUT LOVE AS A SORT OF A A AN INTERESTING ASPECT OF OUR PSYCHOLOGY WHERE IT'S A STORY THAT YOU CO CREATE WITH SOMEBODY BUT THAT YOU LIVE IN TO THE FUTURE OF THAT STORY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TIK PARUP WITH SOMEBODY THAT WE AS REFERING TO ROMANTIC LOVE THAT THERE'S THE SORT OF MUTUAL AGREEMENT TO CREATE THIS THIS IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IN TO SO'S NOTCH AS ABOUT HOW YOU FEELING THE MOMENT IT'S ALSO THAT YOU PROJECT INTO THE FUTURE QUITE A LOT I'M SEEING A LOT OF PARALLELS WITH AM A HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL AND EFFECTIVE DIET AND U AND I LOVE IT I'M NOT AS SETTING THIS PARALLEL UP ARTIFICIALLY A I'M SETTING OUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IT WAS THAT DOWN TO WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER WHICH IS THAT THE BRAIN IN OUR DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO STICK TO ARE TREMENDOUSLY POWERFUL AND I THINK ONE THING I WILL SAY AS I KEEP IN MIND UM WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE  RESEARCH TATE OF THE MEDANALYSIES ON SAY TIME RESTRICTED EATING VERSES NON WHEN CALORIES ARE ECQUATED DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A DIFFERENCE AND IN WAIHT LOSS FAT LOSS AND MOST BY A MARKER'S HEALTH SAME THING FOR BLO CAR VERSES LOAF AT FEW QUAT CALLORIES IN PROTINE THERE IS THERE IS A MEDANALYSIS ON BY CEVEN HALL BACK IN TO THO SEVENTEEN WHERE THEY LOOKED AT THE AND AGAIN ACTUAL LOSS OF BODY FAT AND ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT WAS THERE WAS I TINK THERE WIS TWENTY TWO STUDIES AN THIS BUT ALL OF THEM PROVIDED FOOD TO THE PARTICIPANTS RIGHT THAT' SOME PORTANT BECAUSE THAT MAKE IN SURES AT ADHERENTS WE MUCH HIGHER IN THOSE STUDIES WHERE IS LIKE VARIOUS FREE LIVING STUDIES SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE FUNKEY RESULTS PEOPLE ARE SNEAKING FOOD OR OR THERE JUST NOT REALLY IT'S VERY DIVIING AWAY THAT THE STUDY WOULD I DEALLY HAVE THEM UNLESS UNLESS THE PERSON IS GETTING LIKE CONTINUOUS SUPPORT LIKE STUDIES WERE THEY HAVE A DIETICION TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE EVERY WEEK TEN DACTS YOU HAVE PRETTY GOD ADHERENCE BUT H MEAN THAT'S EXPENSIVE TO HAVE DONE THE STUDYNG AGAIN LIE WHAT LIMITS STUDIES MONEY MONEY AND MONEY RIGHT M BUT THE LOW CAR FOR SLOFAT PROACHING AND COWERS ARE QUATED BASICALLY NO DIFFERENCE IN FOUTLOWS NOW SOME PEOPLE GET UP SET ABOUT THIS BUT IT'S LIKE WHAT TO ME THAT'S LIKE THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU GET TO PICK THE TOOL YOU WANT THE ONE TOOL IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT MUCH BETTER THAN ANOTHER SO PICK THE ONE THAT WORKS FOR YOU I WHATEVER LEVER YOU'VE GOT A POOL YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS UMENTION A PICKING SOMETHING YOU CAN STICK TO FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IS THERE EVER A CASE FOR SOME ONE SAYING LOOK I LIKE TO EAT LOW CARB OR EVEN QUITO FOR SIX MONTS AND THEN SWITCH TO A MORE STANDARD OMNIVE OR CLORIC MAINTENANCE TIPE DIET AND THEN SWITCH BACK ISTHERE ANY DOWNSIDE TO DOING THAT FOR SAKE OF HOWL FOR OR WEIGT LOSS OVER A TIME OR WEIGHT MAINTENANCE OVERTOMGESS HERE REALIS NOT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT I'M THEN I DEAFTLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT SOME WAINHT HOW TO EAT TO MAINTAIN WAIT IS I THINK THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT A FRACTION PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THAT YES THERE ANYTHING UM IS THERE ANY DOWNSIDE TO BEING A DABBLER YOU KNOW QUITO FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN I'M NOVOR FOR A FEW MONTHS ET CETERA I THINK THAT'S I H A GREAT THING ESPECIALLY TO LIKE MAD BE FIND WHAT YOU FEEL IS EASIEST FOR YOU RIGHT A BUT IN TERMS OF LIKE AS ASTRATEGY I MEAN I GUESS YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE A THIS MIKE GET INTO DOPAMIN BUT LIKE OCHANGE IND GET SOMETHING NEW AND LIKE YOU KNOW YOU FELL BUT MORE POSITIVE IN ON ARTINER MODEL YEE I EXACTILY SO I DON'T THINK IT'S HOW I WOULD USELY SET THINGS UP INITIALLY FOR SOMEBODY BUT IF SOMEBODY TOT HAY I JUST LIKE TO HAVE SOME VARIETY AND AN CHANGED IT UP AS LONG AS THERE STILL LIKE YOU KNOW THERE BEHAVIOURS IN THE DOING PORTION CONTROL OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THEYRE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A CALORY DEFICED OR YOU KNOW TO PITTING ONE OF THEIR GOAL IS I DON'T THNK THERE'S REALLY ANY DOWNSIDE TO IT I DO THINK THE ONE THAN TO KEEP A MIND IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT LIKE GOING BETWEEN EXTREMES SO LIKE A LOW FAT TO LO CARB OR OR VIC AVERSA A THERE CAN' BE IN THAT TRANSICION PERIOD A LITTLE BIT OF WEIRDNESS FOR LIKE O BETTER TERM LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BEEN ON A CUTO GENIC DIET AND ALL THE SUDDEN YOU MOVE TO  LIKE A HIGHER CARB DIET YOU'LL BE LIKE BASICALLY INSELEND RESISTANT FOR  JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME NOW IS THAT GOIN O CAUSE ANY HEALTH PROBLEMS PROBABLY NOT IN THE LONG TERM IT'S LT A'S LOT ESPECIALLY IF YOUARE TILL CONTROLLIN CALERIES BUT JUST BECAUSE YOUR BODY HAS KIND OF LIKE UPREGULATED THESE SYSTEMS DEALING MOST WE MOSTLY WITH FAT AND GLUCO'S PRODUCTION RATHER THAN GLUCOS MATABOLISM SO NOW IF YOU START TAKING GLUCOS OR CARBHIDERED BACK IN LIKE FRE SENLY USE SOMEMI OR GLUCO'S TOLERATE'S TEST AFTER THEY BEN ON QUITO THE DO PRETTY TERRIBLY AT IT BUT THAT DOESN'T LAST THAT LONG ABOUT HOW LONG FEW WEEKS I THINK THAT'S HAT IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING DURING THOSE FIRST FEW WEEKS ARE THE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE GO RUNNING BACK TO WHAT THEY WERE DOING PREVIOUSLY WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BUT UM I CERTINLY DONE THAT I TR I'VE TRIED A VERY LO CARBOR HYDRATE DIET AND I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED AND NOW I KNOW I'M COMPLETELY WRONG BUT I ASSUMED THAT I WAS SO CARBHYDRATE STARVED FOR SO LONG THAT MY INSOLENT SENSITIVITY WHICH IS A GOOD THING BY THE WAY FOLKS IT WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROF AND I WOULD BE ABLE TO JUST SPON SHOP EVERY BIT OF GLUCOST THAT I WOULD HAVE INJESTED THROUGH CARBORAHYDRATE SO I DID INDEED SWITCH OVER AND I FELT LIKE A PRETTY TERRIBLE BRAIN FOG I EVEN GOT SOME GITTERS AND I THOUGHT WHAT IS THIS YOU KNOW MY BLOOD SUGGAR WAS LOW BEFORE NOW MY BLOOD SUGAR SHOULD BE IN MORE MODERATE TERRITORY BUT THEY SOME WHAT YOU JUST SAID I'D UPREGULATED THE ENZIMES AND SYSTEMS IN THE BODY FOR FATMATABOLISM ON THE QUITO DIET AND THEN SWITCHING OVER AM THERE WAS A BASICALY A RAMPING OP OF THE OF THE  THE MOLCOS IVOLVED IN A PRESUMBLING N GLACK CALLS TRANSITION PERIOD AND M THING ABOUT LIKE IF YOU HAVEN'T WEIGHT TRAIN BEFORE AND YOU START WEIGT TRAINING YOU'D FEEL PRETTY TERRIBLE RIGHT LIKE YOU CND BE SORE AND STIFF AND A LIKE CON O STUFF BUT WILL SAY YOU AREN'T NECESSARILY WRONG IN WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT BEING MORE INSOLEN SENSITIVE BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU MEASURE INSOLENT SENSITIVITY SO IF YOU MEASURE WITH SOMETHING LIKE AM YOU KNOW FASTING BUT GLUCOS OR FASTING INSOLENT OR EVEN HOMA I ARE THOSE TEN TO BE PRETTY GOOD ON LOW CARB BUT THAT IF YOU DO IN OLD GLUCO'S TOLERANCES TEST IT SENDS BE PRETTY BAD AND SO IT DEPENDS ON YOUR SPECIFIC MEASURE RIGHT AM SO I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT QUITO MAKES YOU ITO GLUCOS AND TOLERAND ARE INSLENT RESISTANT I THINK AGAIN IT JUST A TRANSITION PERIOD AND I'M NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT IT BUT THERE IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND AND WHAT THE REASONS LIK COUN SOME MAS TO TRANSITION OUT OF QUITO TYPICALLY IF LICKE I'M WORKING WITH THEM OR ONEOF OUR COACHES ORE WORKING WITH THEM WULCIN OF INSTRUCT THEM TO DO IT LIKE SLOWLY IN KIND OF SYSTEMATICALLY OVER LIKE A FOUR TO EIGHT WEEK PERIOD THAT WAY HOPEFULLY YOU KOW THEY'RE NOT HAVING THAT PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS FOR THE LIKE O MAN WHY WHY  I FEEL SO TERRIBLE VERY IMPORTANT POINT I WANT TO GO TO THE OTHER END A LITERALLY IN FIGURATIVELY AND TALK ABOUT GOT HEALTH BECAUSE UNTIL NOW AND CERTAINLTY WHICH YOU DAD CERTAINLY IN THE LAST A FEW MINUTES WE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT SER TOP DOWN PROCESSES YOU KNOW THAT THE BRAIN THE PSYCHOLOGY PLACIBO OF FACTS BUT THE VERY REAL ASPECTS OF THOSE NOT THAT I CAN IMAGINE TWO THOUSAND COLORIES AS HOUSAND CALORIES AND SOMEHOW CHANGED THE LAW OF THIRD MONTINAMATS CAN'T DO THAT BUT WE BEEN SORT OF TOP DOWN IN INTEGRATING A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS INTO WEIGHT LOST MAINTENANCE AND AND WEIGHT GAIN BUT GOT HEALTH LEAST THA THE MORE POPULAR STUDIES ON GOT HEALTH HAV BLOWN A LOT OF THINGS OUT OF THE WATER FOR INSTANCE THIS IDEA THAT YOU COULD TAKE OBS MICE AND LET LITERALLY GIVE THEM FEAGLE TRANSPLANTS FROM LEAN MICE AND YES THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IM I FECLE TRANSPLANTS STEFFLING AM INSERTED THROUGH THE SAME END IN WHICH IT COMES OUT AND I POINT THED OUT BEAS A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME THEY YOU KNW IT WAS CONNISCARI TO ME I THOUGHT YES THIS IS NOT ABOUT INJESTING F SEES THIS AS THEY AY THEY LITERALLY DO A A TRANSPLAN OF HES FROM LEAN MICE IN TO OBS MICE AND THE OBS MICE GET LEAN AND YES THIS HAS BEEN DONE IN HUMANS LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES AND OBSERVE I'M SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE EFFECTS ON WEIGHT LOSS THAT I HAVE TO ASSUME COULD BE RELATED TO PLICEBO OF FACT THEY MIGHT HAVE TOLD THESE O BES PEOPLE I LOOK YO'RE GING TO GET LEAN THROUGH THIS FEOGLE TRANSPLANT FROM LEAN PEOPLE BUT MORE LIKELY IT HAD SOME EFFECT ON THEIR CORPHYSIOLOGY I DON'T KNOW WHICH ASPECTS ALTHOUGH I CAN SPECULATE WHICH ONES AND THEY BECAME LEANER THEY LOST WEIGHT AND THAT IS IN SOME SENSE MIRACULOUS WHEN ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE IMPORTANT ROLL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND EXERCISE AND SOTIETY SIGNALS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT THEY CONTROLLED FOR A NUMBER OF THOSE OTHER VARIABLES ALTHOUGH NO STUDY IS PERFECT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT GOT HEALTH AS IT RELATES TO METABOLISM ENERGYULIZATION AND BALANCE AS FOR THE FIRST I ALL SAY IS I'M NOT A GOT GOT HEAL EXPERT BUT I WELL I FEEL RELL TO THE COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT IT BASED ON CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS I ONE BEING IM SUSAND OF CODA LOSE  OUE MOER WELL SHE'S SORT OF A FENALM IN THIS AREA FROM WHAT I ANSERSE AS ACTUALLY DO HER MASTERS WHEN I WAS DO MY P H T AND LAYMON'S LAB SO SHE WAS SWENE MY LABMATES FOR IM AND YOU KNOW ITHE OTHER THING TO SAY IS EVEN  GOT HEALTH EXPERTS AND SUSANN WILL TELL YOU THIS THEY LIKE YOU DON'T TALK TO ME IN TWENTY YEARS WE WE JUST KNOW SO LITTLE I  THINK THAT'S AN OVERALL THING THE PEOPLE DO UNDERSTAND IS THE SCIENTIFIC INSENSIS MOVES VERY VERY SLOW AND PROBABLY FOR GOOD REASON BECAUSE IF WE JUST FLIPPED OUR SCIENTIFIC NSENSAS BASED ON ONE STUDY I MEAN YOU IT WOULD BE A MESS RIGHT SO IT'S GON TO TAKE TIME BEFORE WOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS AF THE GOT AND WHAT IT MEANS SO WHEN IT COMES TO WEIT LOSS THERE PROBABLY IS A ROLL IN THERE MAY WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON NOW WHETHER THAT IS IT IM SOMETHING WERE EY GOT BAC MACROBIOL MAKE UP THAT'S MORE OBES RESISTANT A PERHAPS IT EXTRACTS LESS CALORIES OUT OF THE FOOD YOU EAT WH I OR PERHAPS IT'S ELEVATING BM AR ALTHOUGH I I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY SOME ONE UNLIKELY DO YOU THINK IT IT IMPACT THE WAY SOTIETY SIGNALS SIR SO THAT'S TO ME O BACK TO THE BRAIN AGAIN SO THAT' WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LINK IN THE THEY GOT BRAIN ACCIS AND SO MY SUSPICION IS THAT IT PROBABLY IS AWORKING THEA APPETITE REGULATION SO THAT THE MEAN  IF WE LOOK AT A IF WE LOOK AT THE MOST EFFECTIVE AM O BEASTY TREATMENTS OUT THERE WHICH IS LIKE SOMEGLUTIDE AI MEAN YOU CONSISTENTLY SEE A YO KNOW FIFTEEN PERCENT WEU KNOW AN AVERAGE LOSS OF BODYWAYT WHICH IS MASSIVE AND PEOPLE KEEP IT OFF A THAT IS A GO P ONE MEMETIC WHICH IS A GUTHORM ON AND IT BASICALLY JUST AS A VERY VERY POWERFUL APPETITE SUPPRESS IT I'D NOT WELL I GUESS I'M INTERRUPTING BUT HOPFULLY WITH A PURPOSE EM BUT THERE'S THIS REALLY INTERESTING STUDY AND IT'S IN MICE ADMITTEDLY BUT A PUBLISHING A NURO SCINS JOURNAL RECENTLY AND THE BASILY TO TAKE AWAY IS THAT LIKE SO MANY THINGS IN NUROL SCIENCE IT THE GEO PU ONE WORKS IN TWO PARALLEL PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN IT SEEMS TO IMPACT NEURONS ON THE HYPITHELEMIS THAT CONTROL SOTIETY SO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND IN THE GOT IT SEEMS TO CREATE A AM THE INACTIVATION OF THE MECHANIC SENSORS IN THE GOD WSO THE PERCEPTION IS THAT THET GOD IS FULL EVEN WERE FULL LER I SHOULD SAY NOT FULL BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE WHO TAKE BSOMICUTI DON'T FEEL BLOADED UNESS I DON'T KNOW MAT THEY MIGHT BUT THAT ONE FEELS AS IF THERE GOT IS ACTUALLY FULLER BECAUSE THESE MECHANIC SENSORS THAT SEND STRATCH OUR SENDING SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN OH LIKE ACT YE HAVE SOME FOOD I'M NOT EMPTY DOWN THERE RIT AM AY RAT I I'M TICKLED BY THIS RESULT MUSTLY BECAUSE EVERY TIME I HEAR ABOUT A A DRUG OR A ROMOLECUL HAVING EFFECT WE THINK IT HAS AN EFFECT AT ONE LOCATION MEN IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING THAT ESPECIALLY FOR SOMETHING LIKE AM APPETITE REGULATION THAT IT WOULD BE IMPACKING BODY AND BRAIN IN PARALLEL AN WE FORGIVE ME I NOT'S A GATELI I'M  II THING REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND AN HERE YOU ARE TELLING AN UROW SCIENTIST ME THAT A LOT PERHAPS CIRCLES BACK TO THESE BRAIN MECHANISMS OF SOCIETY I MEAN I THINK THAT AN ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH ONLEAPT IN YOU KNOW WE USED TO THINK OKE ME TABOLISM IS MOSTLY LIKE LIVER BASE AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S AYOU DON'T METABOLISM ATIPESITE AND SKULLDA MUSCLE BUT NONE OF THE STUFF EXISTS IN ISOLATION THERE'S SO MUCH CROSS TALK BETWEEN THESE PATHWAYS AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WHEN WE GET INTO MECHANISMS THE ONE THINGS I LOVE MECHANISMS BUT ONE THINGS I TELL PEOPLE IS KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN OUTCOME RIGHT SO LIKE WHEN I SAY OUTCOME BASE WERE TALK ABOUT PHYSICAL OUTCOMES LIKE WAIT LOSS FAT LOSS CHANGES IN BLOOD MARKERS WHATEVER THOUGH THAT IS THE SUMMATION OF THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT MECHANISMS SO SURE SOMETIMES YOU CAN EFFECT A MECHANISIC PATHWAY AND YOU G IT CON A STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE OUTCOME BUT NOT ALWAYS YOUKNOW WHENEVER YOU MAKE A TREATMENT OR YOU KNOW KIND OF ANYTHING INTO THE SYSTEM IT'S LIKE THROWING A PEBBLE IN A LAKE RIGHT CREATES RIPPLES AND WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE GOING TO BE RIGHT A AND THAT'S WHY WHT MAY WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW CERTAIN DRUGS WAT WORKS ON THIS PATHWAY AND THEN THEY LIST OFF ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS YOU GO HOW WOULD IT CREATE THAT MANY SIDE AFFECTES BECAUSE NOTHING FOR THE MOST PART THEY DON'T JUST WORK IN ONE PLACE THERE'S MULTITUDE OF PLACES IT WORKS A IN IN TO YOUR POINT ABOUT A SO ME GLUTIDE AND THE EFFECTS ON A MECHANOL CENSERS IT'S PROBABLY WHILE OD PEOPLE REPORT ACTUALLY KIND LIKE NO LOW GRATE NAUSEA A WT WHEN THERE USING SO ME LUTIDE ABECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE IF YOUR OU KNO THAT FEELING IS USUALLY NOT LIKE A REAL COMFORTABLE FEELING BU MEAN THAT WILL GET YOU TO NOT EAT SO I THINK THERE'S ABSOLUTELY LIKELY A CONNECTION A BUT WE HAVEN'T FULLY ELUCIDATED HOW THAT WORKS AND WE THINK ABOT HOW COMPLICATED THE GUT IS I THINK I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THERE'S MORE YOUKNOW THR'S MORE CELLS IN OUR MICROBIO BY FAR THAN THERE ARE IN OUR BODY SO WE'RE AXY MORE AND TERMS OF A SELL PER CELL LEVEL WE'RE ACTULLY MORE BACTERIA THAN WE ARE YOU CARRY OUT I THERE'S A JUST IN SONUNBERG WHOS WONE OF THE WORLD EXPERTS ON MICROBOM HE'S IN THE LAB UP STAIRS FROM MINE AT STAMFORD AND A HE IS THIS IDEA IT'S JUST AN IDEA THAT BECAUSE WE ARE INDEED MORE BACTERIA THAN WE ARE SELLS THE QUESTIONAS WHOSE THE HOST AND WHOS THE PASSENGER  LIKE MAYBE WE E ARE JUST MAYBE THERE EXPLOITING US TO TAKE THEM AROUND AND INTERACT BECAUSE THEY INTERACT AND GROW ON ONE ANOTHER ANS OF THIS IDEA THIS FREAKS PEOPLE OT LEX FREEDMEN WILL OF THIS THAT MAYBE HUMAN BEINGS ARE JUST ACTUALLY THE VEHICLES FOR THE MICROMITHE OTHER WAY OR OUT ANYWAY KIND OF AA A SCARY THOUGHT A DO YOU DO ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT YOUR GOT MICROBIOM ARE YOU A PROBIOTIC GUY OR A FERMENTED FOODS GUYRE A FIBR GUI SO AGAN I'M CANNOT GO STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE FROM WHATEVER FROM SUSAN ANOTHER EXPERTS SO IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE GUT HEALTH ONE OF THE BIGGEST LEVERS THE THREE BIGGEST LEVERS YOU CAN PULL IS NOT EATING TOO MANY CALORIES EXERCISING THERE'S THAT THERE IS A CONNECTUION BETWEEN EXERCISE AND THE GUT AND FIBR SO WE IT IS OF THE THINGS WE KNOW DITERY FIBR SEEMS TO POSITIVELY IMPACK THE GUT BECAUSE IT IS A WHAT'S CALLED A PREBIONIC SO YOU'RE GUT MICROBIODA CAN TAKE ESPECIALLY SOLUBLE FIBR ALTHOUGH THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME EVIDENCE AT LEAST IN MICE THAT THEY IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE SOME INSOLUBLE FIBRE AS WELL I THINK SUSANNE WAS DOING A STUDY LOOKING AN HIMMYCELULOS AN ACTUALLY SEEING THAT SOME LIKE SPECIFIC FORMS OF MICROBIODA FLOURISH WITH HIMMY CELLULOS SUGGESTING THAT THEY MAY ACTUALLY BE GETTING SOME KIND OF FUEL OUT OF IT WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING A BEGIN IN MI SO YOU KNOW JUST HUGE CAVIOT SO YOU'RE GOT MICROBIUM CAN PRODUCE THESE SHORT CHAINED FADIACIDS FROM A BY FERMENTING A THIS THES THE SOLUBLE FIBRE AND THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF EVIDENCE THAT THESE VOLATILE FADIACIDS WHICH CAN BE THEN ACUALLY A REABSORBED IN THROUGH THE LIVER THAT THEY HAVE SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS I'M LIKE FOR EXAMPLE BUTERATE WHEN THEY'VE DONE BUERATE SUPPLEMENTATION THE'VE ACTULLY SEEN POSITIE FFECTS ON INSOLENT SENSTIVITY SO WHAT WE SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT MORE DIVERSITY SEEMS TO BE BETTER FIBR SEEMS TO BE POSITIVE PREBODICS SEEM TO WORK MUCH BETTER THAN PROBIONIC SUPPLEMENTED PREBIONO YES IF SO THE PROBLEM OF MOST THE PROBIONICS IS THERE TYPICALLY NOT CONCENTRATED ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY COLONIZE AND EVEN IF YOU DO COLONIZE WHAT HAPPENS IS TIT LET' SAY YOU COLONIZE AM SOME MICROBIOTA THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MUCH OF IF YOU'RE NOT FUELING IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE FIBRE IT'S NOT GOING TO STAY ANYWAY BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIALLY GOING TO STARVE SO THE RESEARCH SEEMS TO REALLY CLEARLY SUGGEST THAT EATING IN A FIBR AT WHICH IS AGAIN A PREBIODIC THAT THAT IS A BETTER WAY TO GET AA HEALTHIER GOT PER SAY THEN PROBIOTIC WHAT FIBRER SOURCES DO YOU USE AND I THINK I MOMT I REALIZE THERE'S A HUGE ARRAY OF CHOICES OUT THERE BUT PEOPLE WILL WANT HAVE SOME IDEAS AS TO HOW THEY COULD PERHAPS MEMIC WHAT YOU'RE DOING YET AND I WAS TO SAY DIVERSITY RI SO YOU KNOW AF SOME THERE'S THERE'S VARIOUS EVIDENCE FROM VERYUS DIFFERENT FIBRE SOURCES AM FORITS IN VEGETABLES OBVIOUSLY AM WEU KNOW GRAINS SOME WHOLE GRAINS A SOME CEREALS A AND THEN VARIOUS OTHER SOURCES SO THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WHERE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD IDEA IF YOU KNOW THIS ONE SOURCE OF FIBRES BETTER THAN ANOTHER SOURCE OF FIBERE WE JUST KNOW THAT FIBER OVER ALLS PRETTY GOOD AND ONE THEY I'LL TELL PEOPLE IS LIKE IF YOU WANT A LONG GEVITY HACK I MEAN FIBR IS KIND OF ALONGGEVITY HACKIVE IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE COHORT STUDIES ORE IS A ACTUIA RECENT REALLY LARGE METANALYSIS OF OVER A MILLION SUBJECTS AM AND BASICALLY WHAT IT SHOWED WAS THAT FOR EVERY TEN GRAM INCREASE IN FIBRE THERE WAS A TEN PER CENT REDUCTION IN THE RISK OF MORTALITY AND THAT EXTENDED SPECIFICALLY ALSO TO CARDIOVASCULASES AND CANCER SO ONE THINGS I'LL TELL PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET LIKE REALLY INTO YOU KNOWHETHER TEDEMENT FASTAYING OR YOU KNW ALL AL IS SON THINGSTHEY THAT'S GREAT THAT'S GREAT ARE YOU EATING LIKE OVER FIFTY SIXTY GRAMS OF FIBRADAY AND I TI CONCEPTIALIZE FIFTY SIXTY GRAM SO FIREATY A LIKE A A BULT LIKE A WHAT'S TO SAY I QUARTER PLATE OF BROCHLY A AND THE BROCLY ISIN STACK TO THE CEILING HEN ROCHLY IS JIS REASONABLY A STACKED ON THEIR A PROXIALLY HOW MANY GRAMS OF FIBRERS THAT IF IT'S A A LIKE TWO CUPS ABROCHLY IS A LIKE A SO FYOUT LIKE TWO UN IGRAMS OF BROCLY PERSAY WOULD PROBABLY LIKE FIVE SIX GRAMS OF FIBERE AND I NEED TO GET HOW MUCH PERDAY WELL I ONLY TAY I WOULD TYPICALLY WHAT THE RECOMMENDED DOSE IS IS FIFTEEN GRAMS PER THOUSAND CALERIES AND TAKE BECAUSE I YOUR EATING YOU KNOW LOW CALLORIES IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET IN A FIBR IN A BUT BASED ON AND AGAIN THESE ARE COHORT STUDIES SO BUT YOU CAN'T DO TWENTY YOUR LONG RANTOMIZE HUMAN CONTROL TRIALS UNFORTUNATELY THET DOESN'T REALLY APPEAR TO BE A TOP END AT LEAST FOR THE BENEFITS OF FIBRE THAT IT PROBABLY BAWLS DOWN TO LIKE HOW MUCH YOU CAN TOLERATE WITHOUT FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE RRIGHT BECAUSE IF YOURE EATING LIKE A TON OF FIBR I MEAN IT AT SOME POINT IT'S NOT CAN BE VERY COMFORTABLE EXERCISE BECOMES UNCOMFORTABLE AND WORE HAZARDOUS YE AND AS YE KIND OF TOUCHING ON THAT BECAUSEI IT IS IMPORTANT A YOU A LOG PEOPLE HAVE KIND OF IN THE CARNIV ORE COMMENYIS SAID WELL YOU DON'T NEED FIBRE YOU POOP JUST FIND WITHOUT IT AND ALWAYS SAY WILL POOPING IS THE LAST REASON TO HAVE FIBRE TAT YES IT DOES HELP IT DOES SEEM TO MAKE A ELIMINATION EASIER I CAN YOU DON'T DO IT MORE FREQUENTLY ATS BULK TO STOOL BUT THAT'S THOT WHY YOU SHOULD EAT FIBERE WHY SHOULD EAT FIBRE IS BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF MORTALITY AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PUSHBACK WILL BE WHELL THIS IS HEALTHY USURBIUS AND WHAT ALL SAY IS MEANING HEALTHY PEOPLE DO THIS AND THEREFORE HOW  PEOPLEIT MORE FIBRE ON THEIRE FOR AND I MEAN YAT THERE'S THERES SOMETHING TO THAT BUT IF IT WAS JUST HEALTHY USER BY US TYPICAL YOU WOULD SEE SOME DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE STUDIES AND AN GREAT EXAMPLE THAT IS LIKE RED MEAT SO NOT EVERY STUDY SHOWS RED MEAT HAS AN ASSOCIATES WITH CANCSWER IN MORTALITY THER'S THERE'S DIFFERENCEIS DEPING ON THE POPULATION YOUSE DEPENDING ON LIKE WHAT THEY TO FIND US HIRED MEAT LOWRED MEAT WITHER ITS PROCESS ON PROCESS BUT I HAVE NOT FOUND A STUDY ON FIBRE AND CART OF ASKR DISEESE AND CANCER AND MORTALITY WERE IT DID NOT SHOW IMPROVEMENTS FROM HIRE FIBERE SO TO ME THAT SUGGEST THAT THAT THAT EFFECT IS REAL A AND SO AGAIN YOU KNOW AS MUCH FIBER AS YOU CAN GET IN COMFORTABLY I WOULD TRY TO DO IT A BECAUSE IT SEEMS HAVE SOME REALLY POWERFUL EFFECTS AND IS GOOD FOR THE GOT MICROBIUM THE OTHER THING THAT MAY BE A CONSIDERATION FOR MICROBIUM IS THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT SATURATED FAT MAY NOT BE GREAT FOR HE MICROBIUM THAT IT A REDUCES THE A THE PREVALENCE OF SOME SOME OF THE MORE POSITIVE STRANGE OF BACTERIA AND THAT APPEARS TO BE A NOT SO MUCH FROM THE SATURATED FAUT ITSELF BUT FROM THE BILE IN PRODUCTS THAT COMBINED WITH SATURATED FAT SEEMS TO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON SOME OF THESE MORE AM HEALTHY REFORMS I'VE GOT MICROBIOTA BUT AGAIN THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW NECESSARILY YET WHICH SPECIES OF GOT MICROBIONA OR POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE AND THAT'S ANDING THIS GETS IN TO SOME OF THESE STUDIES WHERE THEY MAY CALL IT DISPIOSIS SOUND SCARY BUT DISBIOS IS JUST MEANS THAT THE GOT CHANGED IT DOESN'T NECESSARY IT DOESN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING QUALITATIVE ABOUT WHETHER THE CHANGE WAS BAD OR GOOD AND SO THESE ARE JUST THINGS I THINK WE NED TO KEEP O MIND WE TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF THAT THIS STUFF IS STILL VERY MUCH IN ITS INFANCY BUT IN TERMS THE BIG LEVER LEVERS I MEAN IT'S PRETTY MUCH FITS WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HEALTHY LIFE STYLE EXERCISE DON'T EAT TOO MUCH CONSUME A GOOD AMOUNT OF FIBR FROM DIFERDIVER SOURCES FANTASTIC A FANTASTIC BECAUSE IT FITS WITH WHAT I LIKE TO THINK OF ITS CON TE CENTERE OF MASS OF EVIDENCE RIGHT AND I I'M STRYING TO GET SOME WINDOW INTO WHAT YOUR PROCESS IS AROUND SELECTION OF STUDIES AND NO ONE STUDY BEING HOLY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT AS YOU MENTION ALL THE STUDES ON FIBR HAVING IT A A POSITIVE FACT TO SOME DEGREE ER ANOTHER IT'S PRETTY HARD TO REFUTE THAT THERE ISN'T SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING THERE I WON'T THEY HONT TELL PEOPLE'S LIKE YOU KNOW ONE STUDY I MEAN SOMETIMES I'LL CHANGE MY OPINION BASE ON A SINGLE STUDYWHENTS REALLY WELL DONE AND VERY POWERFUL BUT USUALLY LIKE ONE STUDIES JUST CAN MOVE ME JUST A LITTLE BIT TEN MAY BE IF ANOTHER ONE COMES ON MO ME LOBIT MORE RIGHT AND THEY LIKE VERY SLOWLY IN WHEN IT GETS I' MEN MY MY EXPERIENCE WITH UM E'LL DEAL CLUSTRAL THIS SOME MI CHANGE MO MIND ON A WHILE BACK O WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BUT CIRCU TWO THOUSAND FIVE GETTNG INTO GRAD SCHOOL COND OF THE PREVAILING THOUGHT WAS WELL IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE ELLD YELL IT'S THE RACIO OF ELDELL TO H DELL THAT'S WHAT MATTERS AND PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND I WAS I WAS PRETTY STRONG ABOUT THAT OPINION AND IN FIVE YEARS AGO LOOKING AT THESE MANDILIAN RANDOMIZATION STUDIES A KIND OF WENT I CAN'T HOLD THIS POSITION ANY MORE WHAT'S CORTIN WHAT IS YOUR AVISED POSITION ON ELSEEL SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH H DELLS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A MARKER OF MENABOLIC HEALTH IF YOU HAVE HIGH H DEL IT SUGGESTS THAT YOU ARE MENABOLICALLY QUITE HEALTHY YOU VERY RARELY WILL YOU HAVE HIGH H ELL AND LIKE HIGH S R P WHICH IS INFLAMMATORY MARKER OR DISREGULATED BLUGLUCOSE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGH H DELL WILL HAVE GOOD BILE MARKERS OF A MENABOLIC HEALTH BUT IF YOU TAKE DRUGS THAT RAISE H DELL IT DOESN'T REDUCEURISK CRY BASKER DISEASE IN MEND IN MENDILLIAN RANDOMIZATION STUDIES WHICH MENDILLING RANOMIZATION BASELLY USES NATURAL RANDOMIZATION SO SOME PEOPLE ARE IN THE CASE OF H DELL NATURALLY HIHER SECRETERS OR NATURALLY LOWER SECRETORS OF H DELL AND YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU CAN'T REALLY DO AT TWENTY EUR HUMAN RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO EXAMINE SOMETHING LIKE HEART DISEAS I MEAN THAT IS A LIFE TIME EXPOSURE ISSUE IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PICK OUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENTS IND TWO YEARSS OR EVEN FIVE YEARS I MEAN PEOPLE DON'T DEVELOP TYPICALLY DON'T DEVELOP HEART DISEASE UNTIL THERE IN THERE UKNO FIFTY SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WOMENDILLING RANDIMIZATION ALLOWS IS TO SAY O K WE HAVE THESE PEOPLE WHO NATURALLY SECRETE MORE OR LESS SO WE CAN STRATIFY THOSE AND LOOK AT WHAT IS THEIR RISK SO IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO ARE LOST CRES F HTEL VERSES HIGH SECRETORS OF AHTEEL WITH HOLDING SOME OF THE OTHER KEY VARIABLES CONSISTENT LIKE ELDIEL YOU DON'T SEE AN EFFECT ON HART DISEAS REALLY OF ELDIEL OF TEL GOT IT OK BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ELDIEL AND YOU LOOK AT THE LIFETIME EXPOSURE TO ELDIEL IT IS LIKE A LINEAR EFFECT ON HEART DISEASE AND WE WE KNOW THAT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT SO MUCH ELDIEL BUT'S MOR I APLE LIP OPROTINE B BUT THAT TENDS TO TRACK WITH ELDIEL JUST IN GENERAL AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MECHANISM WHEN WE KNOW THAT ELDIEL CAN PENETRATE THE INTITHELIUM A SO THERE'S THE MECHANISM IS PRESENT IF WE LOOK AT THE EPIDIMIOLOGY ITS SUPPORTS THAT IT'S A AN INDEPENDENTROUS FACTOR AND EN AGAIN THESE MANDILIAN RANIVIZATION STUDIES WHERE WE CAN KIND OF LOOK AT PEOPLE'S EXPOSURE OVER A LIFETIME AND THEN WE SEE THAT LINE OR KIND OF DOSE DEPENDENT A FACT TO ME THAT WAS CONVINCING ENOUGH TO CHANGE MY MIND ON THAT PARTICULAR TOPIC AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE SOME OF THE FRAMMINGHAM DATA LOOK AT AM HI IF YOU LIKE STRATIFY LIKE HIHDEL VERSES LO H DEL BOTH GROUPS LOOKING AT HI ELDEL AND LOW ELDEL SO IF YOU HAVE HIGH HDEL LO ELDIL YOU WILL STILL BE LOWEROUS FACTOR THAN SOMEBODY WAS HIHTEL AND HIEOLDIEL RIGHT TO THE RASEO DOES MATTER STHERACIO DOES BY  SAME THING WITHI WITH INFLAMMATION IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO AR LO INFLAMMATION LO ELDIEL THEY'LL HAVE A LOWERIST THEN PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INFLAMMATION HIOLDIEL SO AGAIN THAT WAS KIND OF SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO CHANGE MY MIND BUT IT'S TOOK IT WAS LIKE NOT JUST ONE STUDY CAME OUT IT WAS LOK AN THEN THERE IS ANOTHER STUDY AND THEN ANOTHER STUDY AND ANOTHER STUDY AND IN A CERTAIN POINT I GO OK WELL NOW I OTHER HAVE TO CHANGE MY MIND OR I'M BASICALLY JUST GOT A BE COGNATIVELY DISCITAT AND SAY NO I DON'T BELIEVE ALL THAT YOU KNOW AND AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS TO KEEP IN MY PEOPLE WE'LL SAY AL YOU ARE YOUR SAYING THIS IS A BAD STUDY VERY RARELY WH I CALL SOMETHING A BAD STUDY BECAUSE DATA IS JUST DATA BUT THE ISSUE BECOMES HOW IT IS PRESENTED AND HOW BROADLY IT'S APPLIED IND THE MAINSTRE MEDIA OR BY BOU PEOPLE ON YOU KNOW FITTES INFLUENCERS AND WHAT I'LL DO IS TRY TO STEP IN AND SAY OK LET'S CONSIDER EXPUIAN Z IS WELL AND THEN IT'S NOT A BAD STUDY BUT LET' JUS BE CAREFUL BOUT HOW BROADLY WE IMPLY THE INTERPRETATION  W AND I I THINK YOU ARE IN A VERY UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT POSITION TO BE ABLE TO PLACE THINGS INTO THEIR PROPER CONTECT BECAUSE OF THIS FOR LACK OA BETTER WORD HOLISTIC VIEW OF HOW THE PSYCHOLOGY PLECEBO OFFACTS ALSO CARFOT A QUARPHYSIOLOGY UM RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER AND SO ON IN FACT I THINK THAT YOUR TRAINING AS ABOUT CHOMEST AND THEN TRAINING AS A UAM IN NUTRICIAN WITH SOMEBODY WHO DONLAYMAN WHO WAS PUSHING YOU TOO FOCUS ON OUTCOMES ANTHING THIT'S A BEAUTIFUL AM CAPSR R OF THE THE CONTINUUM AT WHICH ONE CAN LOOK AT SOMETHING BECAUSE FOR THOSE AF YOU DON'T KNOW OUT THERE YOU KNOW IT LOT OF LABORATORY STUDIES ON MICE AN HUMANS FOR INSTANCE IN THE ROMOBILE CHEMISTRY OR IN BEETRO STUDIE YOU'LL SEE A CHANGE IN SOME MOLECULE CAN BE QUITE DRAMATIC AND THEN THE ASSUMPTION IS OH YO JUST TAKE YOU TAKE THE DRUG THAT WILL CHANGE THAT MOLECULE ON A PARTICULAR DIRECTION AND THEN YOU'LL GET THE EFFECT YOU WANT IT THAT AT THE WHOLE ORORGANISM LEVEL THE PERSON WILL LOSE WEIGHT THE PRSON WILL GAIN MUSCLE THE ANIMAL WILL I'M NOT I HAVE ALSHIMERS ET CETERA BUDY JUST DOZEN WORK THAT WAY BECAUSE OF THE REDONE AN SEE AND THIS INTERPLAY WELL GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS SO MY RESEARCH WAS ACTUALLY IN RODANS ALL MY ALL MY STUDIES ON PROACHING METABOLISM AND AN LOOSING IN PARTICULARS WHAT WE ARE STUDYING WELL WE KNOW IF YOU GIVE LOOSING INCREASES MUSCLE PROTING CYNTHESIS BUT WE ALSO KNOW IF YOU SUPPLEMENT WITH LOOSING PEOPLE DON'T GET MORE MUSCULAR I WAS AT AS LI AS LONG  AL YOT TO DO A SUPPLEMENT WEN LOSY NIGT AN I WRITE AND SO HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHER OU KNO MUSCLE BUILDING IS NOT JUST PROTINE CYNTHESIS IT'S ALSO THE BALANCE BETWEEN CYNTHESIS AND DEGRADATION SO IM AN DEGRADATION JUST HAPPENS TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE BUT A A GREAT EXAMPLE AND AGAIN HELE THE COOL THINGS WON MY PEAGEDE WAS AC UAL CHANGED THE WAY I ATE IM WHICH I THING IS INTERESTING SO BEFORE I HAD BEEN LIKE A IHT EIGHT MILL ST DAT EVERY TWO HOURS TOD YEELS A DAY YHAV WHEN I CAN ONDER ATI IN THAT THIRTY GRAMS ARE PROACHING YOU RAME THAT A MENO DRIP GOING IN WAS THE IDEA RIGHT I JUST HAVE AN IVY HOOKED UP OF MENOLASCIS NOT REALLY FOLKS NOT REALLY YEBUT THAT THAT WAS CONE TOE CONCEPT BUT THE FIRST STUDY I DID WE BASICALLY LOOKED AT O K A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD MEASURED THE AMPLITUDE OF PROTINGE CYTHESIS IN RESPONSE TO AMEL WE WANTED TO SEE HOW LONG DOES THIS LAST AND WHERE IS AT PEAK RIGHT AND SO MY THOUGHT WAS OK WILL IT A POBBY TRACK WITH PLASMALOOSING YOU GIVE FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR LOOSING IS THE MEANAL ASCID THAT IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR INCREASING MUSCLE PROTINE SYTHESIS WHEN YOU EAT PROTINE SO IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE BRANCH CHIMINOASCIS SO WE WANTED TO STEE OCE HALLONS THIS EFFECT LAST SO WE WE FED THESE ANIMALS A WAY PROTING AND AGAIN I THOUGHT OKA WILL HAVE OR LONG PLASBELOSINE STAYS UP THAT WOILL BE HOW LONG I PROTINGS OF THE SISTAYES UP AND SO WE GOT THE PROTINGS OF THE SESTATE ABACK AND IT WAS PIQED AT NINETY MINUTES ARE SORY PIQUED FROM FORTY FIVE TO NINETY MINUTES AND THEN WAS BACK DOW TO BASSIDE BY HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES AND SO WHEN I WENT TO DO THE PLASBOLOSING ANALYSIS MI SHOCK WAS AT THREE HOURS PLBOLOOSING WAS STILL PLATEAUED OUT IS OK WELL WHEN I LOOK AT THE INITIATION FACTORS THAT WILL SHOW ME SOMETHING SO IM FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR AM THIS IS PART OF THE IMTORE SIGNALING PATHWAY SO ONE OF THE TWO OF THE TARGETS OF IMTOUR WHEN ITS STIMULATE LOOSING STIMULATES IM TOUR TWO OF THE TARGETS OF IMTOR ARE A APPROACHING COMPOUND CALLED FORT E B P ONE AND THEN ANOTHER ONE IS CALL LD A RIBE IS OLL PPROTING AS SIX KA SO I DONT WANT TO GET INTO THE SPECIFICS ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S CONT BE ON THE SCOPE BUT BASICALLY WHEN THESE THINGS ARE PHOSPHORELATED BY IMTORE A IT INCREASES A THE RATE OF TRANSLITION INITIATION WHICH TRANSLATION INITIATION IS BASELLY THE PROCES OF THE RIBAZOME HOOKING ON TO THE IMAR IN A AND THEN STARTING PROTINE SYTHESIS SO I I WAS LOOKING AT THE PHOSPHER RELATION IFFORE A BEUPY ON AND OUR P AS SIX AS I GO KA WELL I'LL PROBABLY SEE THESE THINGS COME DOWN IT AT THREE HOURS STILL PLATEAUD AND SO THEN IT WAS LIKE WHAT IS WHAT'S GOIN ON HERES I KEPT ACTUALLY KEPT RERUNNING THE DATA AND RERUNNING TE DATA AND RERUNNING THE DATA AND I'LL NEVER FORGET I WENT INTO LAYMAN'S OFFICE AND THIS IS LIKE NO SIX MONTHS AFTER WE'VE DONE THE STUDY CAUSE HI ANALYSIS TIX TIME AN THA SO WHERE ARE WE WITH THIS SDURATION STUDY I SO HI I JUST GOT TO RUN THE PLASME DATA AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT AND HE'S LIKE WELL WHY IS IT NOT RIGHT AND I SO WELL JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE YOU KNOW AND I KOND OF WENT THROUGH HE'S A WOL DESCRIBED TO ME YOUR TECNIQUE LIKE HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS I DESCRIBED IT IN SO WHAT HOW'S YOUR STANDARD ERE I TOLD HIM WHAT THE NUMBERS WEREY SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS GOOD DATA HE SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE TRYING TO GET THE DATA TO FIT YOUR CONCLUSION AND YOU NEEDN'T CHANGE YOUR CONCLUSION TO FIT THE DATA AND THAT STATEMENT THIS IS WHY WE DO PGHTS WHY YET YOU NEON AN ADVISER THIS IS WHY I'M SO SCEPTICAL OF EVERYTHING BECAUSE I HAVE HAD SO MANY OF MY IDEAS CRUSHED BY MY OWN DATA RIGHT SO WE OXY IN IT UP THIS THIS AM THIS KIND OF E FACT AS THIS PHENOMENON IS CALLED A MUSCLE PROTINE SYNTHETIC REFRACTORY PERIOD SO BASICALLY LIKE ONCE YOU TRIGGER THE SYSTEM KIND OF RUNS FOR DEFINE PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN IT TAKES TIME TO ES SENTIALLY RESET FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM IT'S ALSO BEEN REFERRED TO IS THE MUSCLE FULL EFFECT A BUT SO I LOOKED AT THAT AND SAID WHY AM I EATING EVERY TWO HOURS THEN YOU KNOW THEN THERE WAS EVEN A STUDY OUT OF WOLF'S LAB LIKE BACK IN NINETY NINE I THINK WERE THEY INFUSED TO ME ESSENTIAL MUNOACIDS FOR SIX HOURS PROTING SYNTHESIS WENT UP PEKED AT SIXTY MINUTES CAME BACK DOWN A HUND AND TWENTY AND NEVER WENT BACK UP AGAIN MAYBE I'M BENG NAIVE BUT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF PROTING SYNTHESIS GOES UP AND THEN COMES BACK DOWN THAY EATING MORE OFTEN WOULD BE EXACTLY THE THING YOU U'D WANT TO DO IF YOUR GOAL WAS TO GET INCREASED PROTINE SYNTHESIS BECAUSE YOU BE PINGING THE SYSTEM PERIODICALLY BUT THAT BUT THE PROBEM IS THE PLASME NUACITERS TILL ELEVATED SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY LIKE EATING THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH RIGHT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LOSE ON THE SELLS UP SO THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I'M MEXIGON TO EAT LESS OFTEN BECAUSE LIKE IF I'M EATING AND THREE HOURS LATER I'VE STILL GOT YOU KNOW CAPPED OUT PLASMA ME NO ACIDS YOU KNOW AND WE LOOED AT ALL KINDS OF STUFF LIKE WE LOOKED AT INTERESTSAO LU SCENE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THOU KNOW THAT WASN'T FALLING OFF IT WASN'T WE LOOKED AT ALL THE PLASPHA ESSENTIAL MENO AC IDS BECAUSE YOU  WEERE THINKING WELL MAYBE PROTING CYNTHESISIS YOUOW SUCKING SOMEBODIES OF A MUNOACES OUT OF THE PLAZMA AND THEIR DROPPING AND THAT'S CAUSING IT TO KIND A SHORT CIRCUIT THE SYSTEM THAT WASN'T THE CASE IT JUST ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUGGEST I THINK WHEETHER ONLY ONCS TO SHOW THIS SO FAR SO I'M NOT RATY TO SAY THAT THIS IS A REAL EFFECT BECAUSE I HOLD OUT THE IDEA THE DATE ARTIFFACTS DO EXIST AND YOU CAN'T BE TOLLY SURE BUT WE SAW A AN INCREASE IN AMP KINASE KIND OF AROUND THIS MARK WHERE APROTING TO THE TO STARTED FALLING OFF WE ALSO SAW A DECREASE IN INTEREST OR EIGHT P AND PROTING CYNTHESIS IS AN EIH T P DEPENDENT PROCESS AND SO WHAT WE THINK MIGHT BE HAPPENING IS YOU'RE YOU KNOW CONSUMING PROTINE AND YOU'RE UPRT YOU'RE INCREASING MUSCLE PROTIENG CYTHESIS AND THEN IT A CERTAIN POINT IT'S HAS ENOUGH EFFECT ON YOURE YOU KN ENERGY MATABOLISM IN YOURSELVES THAT A KIND OF SHORT AR NOT SHORT CIRCUITS IT BUT IT KIND OF CUTS IT OFF RIGHT SO AGAIND WE'RE THE ONLY ONCE TO SHOW THAT THAT I'M AWARE OF SO AND THAT WAS AGAIN IN RATS SO I I I I WAS TAUGHT BY DATA LIKE THOSE DATE I'M WILLING TO BET MY MY TOW ON MY FOOT ON MY LEG ON IN MY LIFE ON I'D PROBABLY BARELY BET THE END OF MY LITTLE TOW ON THAT ONE I'M NOT QUITE SURE BUT IT'S INTERESTING NONE THE LESS SO FOR CATSOING THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF O K WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS MECHANISM OF IMTOR SIGNALLING AND IF WE JUST LOOKED AT THAT WE'D SAY IWLL PROATING CYTHESIS CAN TO STAY ELEVATED FOR NO PAST THREE HOURS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SAW SO YET I THINK IT'S AGAIN THAT'S WHY I REALLY TRY O YOU KNOW GET PEOPLE TO SAY WILLETS MECHANISMS ARE IMPORTANT IT'S IN ESPECIALLY IF YOURE SEEING AN OUTCOME IT'S IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY MECHANISMS THAT MAY EXPLAIN THAT BUT LET'S THET BACK FROM THE MECHANISMS FROM TRYING TO CHASE MECHANISMSMD LET'S LOOK IT LIKE CHASING OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF WHAT WE RECOMMEND THE PEOPLE EXCELLENT POINT IN TERMS OF A CHASING OUTCOMES A NUMBER OF PEOPLE A KNOWER INTERESTED IN WEIGHT LOSS OR WEIGHT MAITENANCE AND SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT TO DAYS CONVERSATION WE'VE COME BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF A SOTIETY SIGNALS WHETHER NOT THEIR BRAIN BASE BODY BASE OR BOTH YENOT WANTING TO EAT MORE IS A GREAT WAY TO MAINTAIN OR LOSE WEIGHT BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO I HEARD YOU MENTION EARLIER THAT PROTINE AND MAYBE SPECIFIC TYPES OF PROTINE OR SOURCES OF PROTINE MAY PROVIDE BETTER SOTIDY SIGNALS THAN OTHER MACKRONUW TRIANCE COULD YOU BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT HOW MACKERNU TRANS INCLUDING PROTINE BUT ALSO CURB AHIDRATES AND FATS IN PACTS SOTIETY AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SOMEBODY WHO FOR INSTANCE WOULD LIKE TO CONICL LOSE A FEW POUNDS TRIGHT PROBABLY WOULD BE HAPPY TO GAIN A LEBIT OF LEAN BODY MASS PROVIDED IT WAS YOU K O PARTICULAR LOCATION ON THEIR BODY THAT SEEMS TO BE A A THING NOW DIRECTED HYPERTROPHY IF YOU WILL AND HOW MUCH THEYSHOULD FOCUS ON PROTINE AS A QUAR COMPONENT OF CREATING THIS DIET YOU KNOW ASSUMING EVERYTHING ELSE AS BEING DONE CORRECTLY THEY GING O HIT THE RIGHT NUMBER OF CALERIES RELATIVE TO THEIR AM THEIR OUTPUT NEAT ET CETERA  HOW SHLETHING ABOUT PROATIN I SUSTIETY SIGNALS AND ARE ANIMAL SOURCES OFPROATINE INDEED WER BYO AVAILABLE TRICKING A WORD A IND FORSTAKE A MUSCLE BUILDING BUT ALSO FOR SAKE OF SOMEBODY WHO JUST WOULD LIKE TO LOSE BODY FAT THEY DON'T WONT LOSE MUSCLE AND THEY LIKE TO BRING THEIR WEIGHT DOWN A FEW POUNDS SO LOT O THINGS ONE OR MORE YEET LAW THINGS TO UNPACK THERE OF THE MACRNU TREAN'S PROACHING IS DEFTLY THE BIGGEST LEVER THAT YOU CAN PULL BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU KOW IT DOESN'T TAKE A TON APPROACHINE TO GET ALOUT THE MUSCLE BUILDING BENEFITS I MEAN TO THINK THE BENEFIT'S REALLY START TO PLATEAU OUT AROUND ONE POINT SIX GRAMS FOR KILEGRAM OF BODY WEIGHT THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT MAY BE EVEN UP TO LIKE TWO POINT FOR OR TWO POINT EIGH GRAHAMS FOR KELO MAY GIVE LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE BENEFIT I THINKE IT PROBABLY LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE AN ASM TOPE IN TERMS OF A CURVE WHERE OU AS YOU PUT MORE INTO THE SYSTEM YOU ALWAYS GET A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT IT JUST GETS TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S SO INFINTESSIBLY SMALL BENEFIT THAT IT'S FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSE IS NO BENEFIT BUT YOU MENTION ONE POINT SIX GRAHAMS APPROATINE PORKILEGRAM OF BODY WAIGHT IS IT WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT AT A THRESHOLD THAT MOST PEOPLE SHOULD TRY AN ACHIEVE DAILY I THINK I SEE VERY FEW DOWNSIDES TO HITTING THAT I MEAN I KNOW SOME PEOPLE AN THI SUGINGTO GET INTO A SUPPER CONVERSATION BY NOSPEOPLE SAY WHILE I DON'T WANT A STIMULATE EMTORE BECAUSE AS CAN MAKE ME DIE EARLY AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND IS IF YOU LOOK AT THIS KIND THIS THOUGHT PROCESS OUT THERE THAT IF YOUR STIMULATING HIM TORY THAT PROATINGEIS CAN MAKE YOU DI EARLY AND FIRST OFF WE HAVE VERY LITTLE HUMAN OUTCOME DAY TO SUPPORT THAT CLAIM AND THE SECOND THING IS IF YOU LOOK AT ANY MACRONUTRIAN ISOLATION I CAN MAKE A MECHANISTIC ARGUMENT THAT IT'S CAN TO KILL YOU SO FAT IF YOU TAKE IN FAT IN DECREASES FLOMEDIA DILATION FLOWMING THAT DALATION IS IMPORTANT FOR HEART HEALTH IN THE SHORT TERM COPYDRATES STIMULATE INSOLENT INSOLENT YOU KNOW PRO IN FLAMMATORY AND YOU KNOW ALL THESE OTHER THINGS AND SO I CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT FOR ANY SINGLE MACRONU TRE AND TO BE NEGATIVE PROLONG GEVITY I WHAT I REALLY WANT PEOPLE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVEN SCIENTISTS GET WRONG THEY LOOK AT AN ACUTE RESPONSE OF SOMETHING AND ASSUME THAT THAT I'S GOING TO RELATE TO LONG TERM OUTCOMES IN SIGNALING SO LET'S YUST TAKE EXERCISE FOR EXAMPLE IF I IF YOU DIDN' KNOW ANYTHING ABOU EXERCISE AND I SAID TO YOU AND YOU I'MEN TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU YOUR HEART RAK GO UP YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE GO UP YOURE INFLAMMATORY MARK RES GO UP YOUR REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES INCREASE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY AS CO DAMAGE YOUR MUSCLES YOU'RE GONG TO SAY I'M NOT DOING THAT THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE YOU KNOW BUT IT DOES ALL THOSE THINGS IN THE SHORT TERM BUT WHAT IS THE LONG TERM EFFECTIVE EXERCISE YOU ACTUALLY GET HEL THEAR ALL ALL THOSE THINGS IMPROVE NOW'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU KON'T PROATING IS A ALONG JEVITY HACK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS I THINK SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS OUT THERE BASED ON MECHANISTIC YOU KNOW THIS INCREASES INTORY THEREFORE WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT I THINK IT IS A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED ARGUMENT THAN THAN JUST THAT SO THERE'S THAT SO PROACHING IS THE BIGGEST LEVER I WOULD SHOOT FOR ONE POINT SIX YOU KNOW GRAMS FOR KILEGRAM IF YOU CAN DO MORE GREAT THERE DOESN'T SEM TO BE REALLY DOWNSIDES TO IT EVEN LIKE UP TO VERY HIGH LEVELS OPPROTINE A HOSE ANTONIO TO THE STUDY THER WAS A YOUR LONG RANDIMISE CONTROL TRIAL IM AND AGAIN IT JUST ONE YEAR BUT THEY WERE LOOKING AT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT BIL MARKERS AND MASICALLY EVEN UP TO LIKE FOREGRAMS FOR KILEGRAM APPROTINE THEY COULDN'T REALLY FIND ANY NEGATIVE HEALTH OUT COMES FROM IT OTHER THAN PEOPLE WERE JUST SO SATIATED THEY ENDED UP EATING LESS CALLORIES A SO PROACHING IS A BIG LAVE LEVER BECAUSE ONE IT HAS A HIGHER THERMIC EFFECT OF FOOD SO GETTING LBUT MORE CALLERY BURN PREDAY EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT TON BECAUSE T E F IS A PRETTY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR OVER ALL ENERGY EXPENDITURE BUT STILL BENEFIT YOU'RE GETTING THE EFFECTS ON LEAN BODYMASS IT'S GOING T  IF YOU'RE IN A DIETS CAN HELP PRESERVE LIN BODYMASS IF YOU'RE AT MAINTNANCE IT'S CAN TO HELP BUILD AR PRESERVE LENE BODYMASSON IF YOU'R IN A SURPLUS CAN HELP BILL APRESERVEING BODYMASS THEN YOU GET THE EFFECTS AN APPETITE SO NOW ON TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE APPETITE EFFECTS TEND TO BE VERY SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUAL FOODS RIGHT SO YOU CAN TAKE A HIGH PROTINE FOOD AND MAKE IT NOT VERY A NOT VERY SAGIATING SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE A REALLY TASTY PROATING BAR WHICH YOU KNOW A WHEN WE WERE GETTING INTO THIS THER NO SUCH THING EXISTED A NOW YOU HAVE PROACHING BARS I SHTAKE PRETTY DARN GOOD BUT IF YO ONE OF TEM I MEAN ARE YOU REALLY SATIATED I I DON'T REALLY FEEL FOSATIATE AFWER MY PROCING BARS MY PREMEAL SNACK RIGHT RIGHT SO WHY BECAUSE I MEAN IT'S PROCESS TO REFINED AND I MADE TO BE VERY PALATABLE KI BUT TAKE SOMETHING LIKE A TWO HUNDRED GRAM CHICKEN BREAST VERY SATIATING RIGHT IM AN ETS WHIMEN PEOPLE SAY WALL CARBAL HYDRATES ARE T VERY SATIATING DEPENDS ON THE CARBA HYDRATE I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM LIKE THE SATIDYAN DECKS A PLAIN BAKE POTATO IS ABOUT AS SATIATING AS IT GETS I I EAT A BOWL OF OATMEAL I FEEL PRETTY GOOD AFTERWARD A FOR A WHILE RIGHT I MEAN AT I USUALLY I'LL EAT THAT ALONG WITH SOME OTHER THINGS BUT I I I COMPLETELY AGREE AM THE SEE YOUR SAYING THAT THE DEFORM THAT IT COMES IN MAY BEVEN HOW MUCH CHEWING AS REQUIRED HOW GOOD IT SMELLS THE R AT ALL HOD ASL ASSOCIATIONS AS TO ME A STAKE IS IT AN INCREDIBLE MEAL LIK I MEAN IF I HAD TO PICK ONE FOOD THAT I CAN EAT EVEN I'M NOT PURE CARNIVOR FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IT WOULD BE THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD GET ME WHERE I NEAD TO GO AND THEN I'D PROWALLY HAVE TO SNEAK SOME FIBRE YOU KNOW BUT I IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT I I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I DON' WANT TO TAKE US OFF TRACK BUT I'DM HOPING IT RELATES ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN ANSWER IT NOW  THE CONTEXT OF THIS IF I'M GOING TO EAT LETS SAY TWO GRAHAMS I'M PRKILEGRAM BODY WEIGHT PROTINE AND I'M NOT EATING MULTIBLE MEALS PORITE MAYBE I'MEATING TWO OR THREE MALS PER DAY I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO BE EATING MORE THAN THE THIRTY GRAHAM THRESHOLD THAT WAS THROWN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME THAT WE CAN ONLY A SIM LATE THIRTY GRAMS OF PROTINE PER MEAL SHI JUST NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT SOME OF IT IS GOING TO GO TOWARDS THE THERMIC A AFFECT OF FOOD AS SOME OF THAT MIGHT BE CONVERT INTO GLUCOSTS OF ALL THINGS THROUGH LUCONAGENESIS SO SHOULD I WORRY ABOUT THIS THIRTY GRAHAM CUT OFF BECAUE I THINK BALANCING THAT THE ONE POINT SIX GRAM POR KILEGRAM BODY WEIGHT THRESHOLD WITH NUMBER OF MEALS WITH THE NEEU O EXERCISE AND WORK AND LIVE MY LIFE AND SLEEP AT SETER UP PRETTY SOON YOU YOU YOU RUN INTO BOTTLE NEXS THOR YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT ALL ON AR YOURE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME TRIME O FOLKAS O AD ALTOMIZE ALL THE THANG OUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'D LOSE YOUR MIND AND YOUR BODY SO I'M WHAT WHA WHAT IS NECESSARY IN TERMS OF I'M FREQUENCE IN IF ONE IS GETTING ENOUGH PROTINE AND THEN TIED INTO THAT QUESTION IS THERE ANY REALITY TO THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU EAT ONE MEAL PRERDAY OR YOUR FASTING AND THEN YOU EAT A YOU'LLIT SAY A TWO HUNDRED GRAHAMS OF PROTNE IN A SINGLE FEEDING THAT YOU CAN ASSIMILATE MORE BECAUSE YOU WERE ARE PROTINE STARVED IS THAT IS THAT A REAL THING SO MOST THE STUDIES WITH PROTINE ARE AFTER A FAST I'M LIKE BECAUSE A TO ASSESS IT WITH STABLEI STOPE YOU HAVE TO BE IN A STUDY STATE SO I'M WE HAVEN'T OBSERVED THAT IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT FASTING REALLY KIND OF A LOWS YOU TO A SIMILATE MORE PROTINE AFTER A FAST SO THIS GETS INTO A CORPE OF ONE OF THE THINGS I LOOKED AT MY PGE T WHICH IS DOES PROTINE DISTRIBUTION MATTER BECAUSE MOST AMERICANS GET ABOUT SIXTY FIVE TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE PROTINE AT DINNER I BREAKFAST TEND TO BE PRETTY MINABLE PROTNE A FOODS TO ANY CULTURE'S ACTUALLY EAT A BIG BREAKFAST AND NOT A BIG LUNCHEIN DINNER I GET ON O WEALL HONER THAT TAT WAS IDEAL WILL GET INTO CIRCADIAN TIMING AN MEN DOES ANY ONE ACTUALLY DO THAT STAKE AN EGGS FOR BREAKFAST AND THEN TAVER OFF THE REST OF THE DAY I KNOW GERMAN CULTURETONS TO HAVE A BIG BREAKFAST BUT ALSO TO TO BE LIKE SUGARY FOODS AND WHAT NOT AS FAR AS LIKE TELILOGICALLY I'M NOT I'M ACTULLY NOT SURE ABOUT THAT I'M SO IF YOU LOOK AT THAT AND THEN YOU CONSIDER THAT PROTINE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A STORAGE MECHANISM I LIKE PEOPLE ILL SAY WELL YOU KNOW LEAN TISSUE IS A STORAGE MECHANISM I THAT'S LIKE SAYING A HOUSE IS A STORAGE FACILITY FOR WOOD OUKNO YE IF YOUR HOUSE AS MANE OUT OF WOOD YOU COULD GET WOOD OUT OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT WHIE YOU BUILD THE HOUSE RI LIKE YOUR BUILDING THE HOUSE OUT OF A DEMAND SAME THING FOR MUSCLE TISSUE I'M THERE IS A FREE POOL OF A MENAL ACIDS BUT IT'S VERY VERY SMALL SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER THINGS LIKE FAT WHICH BASICALLY HAS UNLIMITED STORAGE CAPACITY CROB AHYDRATE A RELST OF THEU LARGE STORAGE CAPACITY YOU CAN STORE ME FORE FIVE HUNDRGRAMS OF CROAHYDRATE BETWEEN YOUR LIVER AND MUSCLES AND THEN PROTINE WHICH ALMOST HAS NO STORAGE CAPAC THE A THE IDEA THAT O CA YOU COULD MAKE UP FOR LOW PROTINE AT ONE MEAL BY OVER CONSUMING ANOTHER MEAL DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME SO ONE OF THE STUDIES WE DID AND AGAIN IN RATS WE TOOK A BOTH GROUPS WERE GETTING WEIY PROTINE SO HIGH QUALTY PROTINE THEY WERE GETING THESACTSIM INT A CALORIES EXACTSI MOUNT OF YOU KNOW NITROGEN EXACT SAME MACKROS EVERYTHING WAS SAMED ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS ONE GROUP BASICALLY GOT KIND OF THREE MEALS OF SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF PROTINE LIKE DINNER WAS A LULLBIT BIGGER BECAUSE WE WANTED TO KEEP IT SOMEWHAT SOMEBON HW PEOPLE EAT BUT EACH MEAL WAS COULD BE OVER THE THRESHOLD A SIMULATE MUSCLE PROTINE SYNTHESIS WERE AS THE OTHER GROUP I CONSTRUCTED IT SO THE FIRST TWO MEALS OF THE DAY SHOULD NOT STIMULATE MUSCLE PROTINE CYNTHESIS IT SHOULD BE UNDER THAT THRESHOLD AND IN THE LAST MEAL WAS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THER TOL DAILY PROTINE AND SO WE HAD 'M EAT THOSE FOR ELEVEN WEEKS AND I'LL I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS THIS IS HOW LIKE OBSESSIVE I BECAME ABOUT IT IS THEREWAS A HUNDRED TEN ANIMALS IN THE STUDY AND I MADE ALL THE DIETS AND I WEIGHT OUT EXACTLY EVERY SINGLE MEAL FOR EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL FOR ELEVEN WEEKS SO I WAS IN THERE AT SIX I M I WAS IN THERE AT YOU KNOW NOON AND OWWAS IN THERE AT SIX P M YOU KNOW  SO GOT A PAGE DESTUN THAT FASSORS DREAM A GAN A DREAMS TUD ANSO AT THE END OF ELEVEN WEEKS WE LOOKED AT LIKE LEAN BODY MASS WE LOOKED AT BODY FAT WE LOOKED AT A AHINDS LIMB WEIGHTS WE GENERALLY SEE DIFFERENCES IN LEAN BODY MASS BUT WHT WE DID SEE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN HIND LAND WEIGHTS AN WASN'T MASSIVE BUT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE SIZE OF THE MUSCLES OF THE HIND LANS OF THESE ANIMALS AND SO AS INTERESTING THAT THERE WASN'T A A DIFFERENCE AND LEAN BODY MASS AND WHAT WE FOUND AT LEAST WITH THE LIVER THE ANIMALS THAT WERE EATING A THE LIKE ONE MEAL WITH REALLY HIGH PROTINE ACTUALLY HAD BIGGER LIVERS A NOT LIKE A HUGE AMOUNT AND NOT SOMETHING TO HAVECANCITERUN SAFE BUT THEY IT WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCS AND SO TO ME AT LEAST LIKE CONM TRYING TO EXPLAIN LIKE NO DIFFERENCE AND LEAN BODY MASS BUT AT A DIFFERENCE IN THESE HIND LAND WEIGHTS MAYBE THERE'S SOME LIKE SEQUESTERING OF YOU KNOW  LIKE THE THAT THAT'S FUELING A LITTLE BUT MORE APPROCHING SENTHESIS OF THE SPLAINNIC TISSUES RATHER THAN YOU KNOW CAUSD YOU'R CAPPING OUT SKELLA MUSCLE PROTINE SYNTHESIS AND WE DO KNOW THAT THE SPLINTNIC TISSUES ARE MORE SENSITIVE OR HAVE A GREATER RATE OF PROTINE CYNTHES PERDAY LIKE THE RATE OF SKELEA MUSCLE PROTINE YNTHESIS IN HUMANS IS ABOUT LIKE ONE PER CENT PER DAY SO IT TAKES LIKE A HUNDRED DAYS TO TURN OVER YOU KNOW SKALLA MUSCLE WERE IS LIKE YOUR ENTIRE GOT YOUR ENTIRE G I WILL TURN ITSELF OVER IN LIKE TWO TO THREE DAYS RIGHTS BUT VER REALLY AND THE LIVER ALSO HAS A VERY HIGH AMOUNT OF PROTINE CYNTHESIS WHICH IS ONE O THE RECENS IS ACTING ON THE MOST MEDABOLICALLY ACTIVE ORGANS S O ALL THAT TO SAY IT HAS NOT IT'S BEEN THERE'S BEEN ONE HUMAN STUDY THAT SHOWED SOMETHING SIMILAR AM AND THEN THRE'S BEEN A COUPLE OTHERS THAT DIDN'T AND THEN THEN THE NERMENT FASTING STUDIES WHICH S MAYBE A GOOD TOOL TO LOOK AT COMPARED TO CONTINUOUS FEEDING IT ONE THING I WILL SAY IS AT LOOKS LIKE THE SIXTEEN EIGHT INTERMENT IN FASTING STYLE THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE STUDIES WITH GRANT TENSLEY  AND THIS IS SOMETHNG I'VE CHANGED MY MIND ONT AS WELL GRANTINSLEY HAS DONE A COUPLE STUDIES WHERE THEY DID USED THE SIXTEEN EIGHT PROTOCAL THEY HAD THEM TRAIN DURING THEIR FEEDING WINDOW AND THEY HAD THEM EAT I THINK IT WAS AT LEAST THREE PROTINE CONTAINING MEALS DURING THAT SEIHT HOURS A HUMANS THESE OCCUMENTS AND THEY SAW NO DIFFERENCE IN LEAN BODY MASS AT THE END OF THE STUDY COMPARED TO PEOPLE WHO WERE EATING YOU LIKE MOU KNO AS MANY TIMES DO THEY WONE THROUGHOUT THE DAY NOW IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE MORE AH EXTREME FORMS OF FASTING LIKE ALTERNATE DAY FASTING OR LIKE TWENTY TWO TWO OR TWENTY FOUR THERE ARE SOME STUDIES WHERE YOU DO START TO SEE DIFFERENCE AS AN LEAN BODY MASS SO MY SUSPICION IS AND I' I I'M JUST GUESSING SO THIS IS TINUOUS MY SUSPICION IS PROBABLY IF YOU'RE GETTING LIKE TWO TO THREE LIKE HIGH QUALITY PROTINE MEALS IN A DAY A YOU'RE GETTING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BENEFITS OF PROTINE THAT  THE MOST IMPORTANTHING IT'S GETTING ENOUGH TOTAL AH AND THEN SECONDARILY TRYING TO GET  AT LEAST TWO OR THREE MALS WITH HIGH QUALITY PROTINE IN BUT IF YOU'RE GOING LIKE PRETTY EXTREMELIT LIKE ALTERNATE DAY FASTING OR YOU KNOW MAYBE ONLY ONE MEAL A DAY THEN I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME EFFECTS ON LEAN BODY MASS BUT AGAIN THES CAN BE MIMITIGATED AS WELL IF YOU'RE DOING INO HARD RESISTANCE TRAINING TYPICALLY THAT IS THE BIGGEST LEVER IN TERMS OF LEAN BODY MASS YES YOU KNOW PROTINE DISTRIBUTION MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT I'M TRYING TO PUT IN CONTACTS OF PEOPLE ON FILL I THINGTON TO GO ON EAT YOU FOUR MEALS O DAY AM BUT AGAIN SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS LIKE SOME OF THE MORE MILDER FORMS OF YOU KNOW TIME RESTRICTED EATING APPEARE TO BE FINE FOR LEAN BODY MASS NOW THAT THE CAVIOD IS THE FOLLOWING ONE OR THE NICE THINGS BY ANIMAL STUDIES IS WHEN YOU CONSIDER IF YOU ONE TO HAVE A HIGH SUBJECT NUMBER HIGH LEVEL OF CONTROL IN A LONG DURATION IT'S PRETTY MUCH YOU'R ONLY OPTION RIGHT SA I I'VE A IN OUR RESEARCH ROVIEW A RAPS I CREATED A THEN DIAGRAM WHICH BASICALLY IS LIKE THREE AM YOU KNOW CIRCLES CROSSING OVER ONE IS STUDY DURATION ONE IS AM LEVEL OF CONTROL AND THE OTHER ONE IS SUBJECT NUMBER AND TO GET ALL THREE OF THOSE CIRCLES TO CROSS OVER IT ALMOST HAST TO BE IN ANIMALS RIGHT SO IN THIS ENRAPS ISN'T IT'S A NEWS LETTER OR A BOOK SO ITSA IT'S OUR MONTHLY RESEARCH RE VIEW GRY SO EVERY MONTH WE REVIEW LIKE FIVE AM STUDIES THE COME OUT AND FITNESS A NUTRITION LIKE WELL USEY DO AT LEAST ONE NUTRICIAN ONE TRAINING IN ONE SUPPLEMENT PER PER MONTH W I WILL PUT A LINK TO WHERE THEV CAN SIGN OUT THIS IS A A SIGN OUT YOU OR MAT GRAN UP YOVE SO ITS SE SCRIPT SUBSCRIPTION BASE SERVICE SO BASICALLY WHEN PEOPLE MIGHT LOOK IT LIKE MY STUDY WE WHY DID YOU SEE DIFFERENCE AND AND MUSCLE WAIGHTS WHEREIS SOME OF THESE OTHER STUDIES DON'T SEE A DIFFERENCE I WAIDE OUT EVERY SINGLE MEAL FOR ELEVEN WEEKS AN KEEP IN MIND THAT ELEVEN WEEKS IN A RODAN SLIFE SPAN IS A REALLY LONG TIME THAT'S ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF THEIR TOTAL LIFE SPAN SO IS IT THAT THERE'S NO EFFECT OR IS IT THAT THE EFFECT IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND WOULD TAKE A REALLY LONG TIME AND VERY HIGH LEVEL OF CONTROL TO SEE IN HUMANS I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY RELATIVELY CONFIDENTLY IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO LIKE A SIXTEEN EIGHT INTERMENT AND FASTING YOU'RE PROBABLY FINE ESPECIALLY AND AGAIN WHAT IS THE GOAL RIGHT LIKE IF YOU'RE A BODY BUILDER LOOKING TO BE THE MOST MASSIVE PERSON YOU POSSIBLY CAN OR YOU'REOE A FOOTBALL PLAYER YOU'RE SOME IN SOME FEELD THAT HAVING AS MUCH LEAN BODY MASS AS POSSIBLE IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU THEN I WOULD SAY WEU'RE NOT REALLY GAINING A WHOLE LOT BY DOING SOME FORM OF TIME RESTRICTED EATING I THINK MOST OF HE PEOPLE ISTENING TO THIS DON'T DO NOT FALL INTO THAT CAT RIGHT THENG MUST BE WANT TO MAINTAIN OR LOSE WEIGHT THEY'D LIKE IT PERHAPS AD A LIT OF COTON COK SHAPE OR MUSCLE TOS PAS VICARIAS OF THEIR BODY AND LOSE BODY FAT RT AND I THINK YOU'RE NOMAL FORMS OF TIME RESTRICTING IN YOURE POBLY PERFECTLY FIND FOR THAT RIGHT AND AGAIN IF I DON'T WANT SOEBODY TO THINK WHILE I DO YOU KNOW IM ALSON A DAY FASTING THERE'S NO POINT TO BE RESISTED TRAINING CAUSE I'M GAN TO LOSE MUSCLE MASS NON NONONO NO YOU CAN STILL BUILD MUSCLE DOING THAT YOU JUST MIGHT NOT BUILD AS MUCH MUSCLE AS YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE EATING IN A MORE TRADITIONAL FORMAT BUT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR YOU IN YOUR GOALS AN E SPECIALY IF IT'S FAT LAWS OR YOU NO CONTROLL YOUR CALORIES THEN AGAIN IT'S HA IT'S ABOUT THE HIARCHY OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I DO THINK THAT TIMING AND FREQUENCY MATTERS A NOT SO MUCH FREQUENCY BUT DISTRIBUTION MORE SO IM SO I THING THE DISTRIBUTION MATTERS BUT IT'S A IT'S A MUCH SMALLER LEVER THAN JUST GETTING ENOUGH TOTAL PROATINE IN AND THEN AS FAR AS LIKE ANIMAL VERS IS PLANT I USE TO BE IN THE CAMP OF THERE'S NO WAY SOMEBODY CAN BULD AS MUCH MUSCLE ON A PLANT BASE DY IT AND NOW I THINK I'VE COME BACK TO YOU CAN IT JUST REQUIRES A LIBUT MORE PLANNING IM AND I DON'T WAT TO SAY ALWAYS BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO WITHOUT AN ISOLATED SOURCE OF PROATING SO UNLESS YOU'RE GONG TO SUPPLEME WITH AN ISOLATED PLANT SOURCE OF PROATING IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ENOUGH WITHOUT GOING OVER ON TOTAL CALERIES BECAUSE YOU CAN FIGURE THAT ESPECIALY LIKE TAKE SOMEBODY YHO MAY BE CALERICALLY RESTRICTED TRYINING ENOUGH PROACHING FROM WHOLE INTACT PLANT SOURCES SO YOU'VE GOT A FEW DIFFERENT THING'S WORKIN AGAINST YOU ONE THE SOURCES APPROACHING YOURE CONSUMING ALSO HAVE CROMA HYDRATE AND ORE FAT IM TOO IT'S A LESS BIE OF ELBAL FORM OF PROATINE AND THREE IT' SHE LOWER QUALITY OF PROACING IN TERMS OF IT HAS TYPICALLY LESS LOOCING LESS BRANCHING MUOACIS UNLESS ESSENTIAL MENOACICE YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT I ALMOST INTERRUPTED YOU TO ASK WHICH WAS DOES IT WEIL DOWN TO THE LUCINE CONTENT AND A IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS AND THAT A A LOT OF THE VEGAN ANVEGETARIAN SOURCES OF EXCELLENT PROTINE AM THAT EXCELLENT PROTINE VEGETARIAN A REGAN SOURCE IS COPACKAGE WITH CALORIES FROM ARBOR HYDRATES TAND OR FAT THAT MAKE IT HEART TO STAY STAY UNDER THWHICH I COR THRESHOLD WHEREAS A STAKE IS IM NOT AN OVISIN FOR PEOPLE MIGHT ONE WHO VOY THAT FORATHICAL REASONS SIRBT THAT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER ENTIRELY BUT A STAKE OR A PIECE OF CHICKEN OR AN EGG IS WHILE NEGOUNO HAS A YOKE WHICH IS THERE'S FAT THERE BUT IS LMOST A PURE PROTINE FAT SOURCE THERE'S NO CARBO HYDRATE ALONG FOR THE RIT  SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU YOU CAN DO IT TAKE SLITLE MORE PLANNING AM AND YOU'R ALMOST ALWAYS IF YOU'RE A VEGAN ESPECIALLY YOU CAN BE BETTER OFF LIKE SOMETHING WITH SOME ISOLATED FORM OF PROTINE A VEGAN FOR APPROACING NOW THIS WORD GETS IN TO PEOPLE SAY W ONE ABOUT THE LIMITING AMIOACIDS AND THOSE SOURTS OF THINGS IT'S A CONSIDERATION AM SOME OF THE BETTER FORMS OF A VEGAN PROACING AN TERMS OF A MENOACD CONTENT ARE LIKE SOY NOW I CAN EVERYBODY HEAR EVERYBODY SCREAMING ON LINE ABOUT THE TESTOSTRO NEVELS IN TERMS OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES AND LOOKING AT TESTOSTRONE THERE IS A RECENT METANALYSIS LOOKING AT SOY AND I THINK IF IT'S YOUR ONLY SOURCE OF PROACINE THEN MAYBE THE DOSAGEIS HIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE SOME WEIRD EFFECTS A BUT IF YOU'RE JUST USING IT LIKE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY DOESN'T SEEM TOHAVE AN EFFECT ON TESTOSTRONOR ASTROGEN SO THAT CAN BE A DECENT SOURCE OF ROAHING BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLETE PROACINE SOURCE IA IT DOES HAVE A PEATY COS OF ONE WHICH PETICOS IS BASICALLY A A MEASURE AF PROACING QUALITY BASED ON DOES IT PROVIDE ENOUGH OF ALL THE MENOACID SO THAT NONE ARE LIMITING AND SO SOY IS ONE OF THE ONLY VEGAN SOURCE THAT DOES THAT INTERESTINGLY POTATO PROACING ISOLAT ACTUALLY HAS A SIMILAR ESSENTIAL MENACID CONTENT TO WAY SO ISOLATEO PROTENT APPROACING IT'S JUST REALLY HARD TO FIND I'VE BES N NO BEEN TRYIN TO E AGING IN TO TAKE NO VEGETARIANS TAKE NOT BECAUSE A VEGAN'S RATHER CAUS WAY IS VEGETARIAN AM AN WAYA IS VERY A HI QUALLTY PROATINGS VERY HI POS PROTING ORACTING DIRECTING A CREATING WAY NOW OUT OF AM I THINK IT'S I MAY MIS CHARACTERIZIS BUT I BELIEVE THEY'RE ABLE TO PRODUCE AN OW LIKE YEAST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT A BE NO SO FOR VEGANS NOW THIS IS A GREAT OPTION BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE WAY THAT'S NOT ANIMAL BASE THAT IS GOING TO BE EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS AN ANIMAL BASE WAY SO I THINK THAT'S GREAT AM GETTING TO THE LOOSING MEGABACK SORRY SO ANOTHER REASON THAT THE USING AN ISOLATE APPROACING CAN BE HELPFUL IS AM BECAUSE IT'S MORE BILE OF ELBOW AS WELL ONCE BEEN ISOLATE TOUT WHEN IT'S THE PROATING BO MED UP IN THE ACTUAL PLANT MATERIAL IT TENDS TO BE LESS BILE OF EIBLE NOW COOKING CAN HELP INCREASE THE BOW OF ELL BOUTY A BI OF ELL OBILLITECAUSE IT BREAK SOME OF THOSE BONDS AND AND WHAT NOT BUT IT STILL SEEMS TO BE LOWER AND YOU DON'T IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THERE IS A RECENT STUDY WHERE THEY DID AY A CORN WHEAT AND PEEBLIND OF PROTINE VERSES WAY AND BASELY THE OUTCOME WAS A THIRTY GRAMS OF EAC SIMILAR STIMULATED ROTING SYNTHESIS TO A SIMILAR DEGREE BUT THE PLASMOME NO ACIDS IN THE A PLANT BASE PROATING STILL DID NOT GET AS HIGH AS WITH WAY NOW IT MAY BE THAT THAT'S JUST IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE WHAT SHE GET TO A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU GET ALL THE BENEFITS SO A BASTILL FOUND IT INTERESTING NONE THE LESS THAT DIDN'T QUITE GET AS HIGH A THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER WITH THE VEGAN'SOURCES APROATING IS THE LOOSING CONTENT SO ONE OF THE STUDIS WE DID WAS WE LOOKED AT WHEAT SOY EGG AND WAY I SODNI TROGENIST MEANING WE ACQUATED PROATING BETWEEN THE GROUPS I SICL WORK WE ACCRATED CWE ACQUATED CALORIES AND WE LOOKED AT MUSCLE PROATINE SYNTHESIS AND I THINK THIS WAS THE MULES WERE FIFTEEN PERSENT OF TOTAL ENERGY FROM PROTINE SO LIKE A LIKE YOUR FOOD GUIDE PYRAMID LEVEL OF PROTINE AAND WE SAW THAT IN THE WHEAT AND SOY GROUP A THEY DID NOT INCREASE MUSCLE PROTING SYNTHESIS BUT THE EGG AND WAY GROUP INCREASED MUSCLE PROTING SYNTHESIS NOW WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING AS WE WENT BACK AND WE TOOK WHEAT AND ADDED FREE LOOSING TO IT TO MATCH THE LOOSINE CONTENT OF WAY AND THE PROTING SYNTHETIC RESPONSE WAS IDENTICAL SO AGAIN I I DON'T LIKE TO SIMPLIFY THINGS TOO MUCH BUT LOOSING APPEARS TO REALLY BE DRIVING THIS SHIP AND  I'LL NEVER FORGET A LAMAN CALLE ME TIS OFFICE ONE DAY AND HE WOULD ALWAYS DO THESE LIKE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS A HE LIKE HE LIKED TO THINK ABOUT WY SOMETHING OCCURS THE WAY IT DOES DANGEROUS DANGEROUS TERRITORY YES SO HE WOULD SAY ONE DAY I'LL EV FRIASE E LANE WHY DO YOU THINK THE BODY EVOLVE TO JUST SENSE LOOSING FOR MUSCLE PROTINE SYNTHESIS AND OF COURSE I'M LIKE OH I'LL NO MAY I JUST WORK HERE LIKE  JUST TRYIN TO GET MY THE AE TY A AND HY SAI WE THINK ABOUT IT YOU WOULD WANT SOMETHING THAT REALLY WASN'T EXSTENSIVELY METABOLIZED BY THE GOTTEN LIVER BECAUSE YOU WOULD WANT ITS SHOW UP IN THE BLOOD IN VALUES THAT REFLECT WHAT YOU JUST AT MAKE SENSE AND YOU WOULD WANTED TO HAVE PASSIVE DIFFUSION ACROSS THE MUSCLE CELL BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE CONCENTRATION DEPENDENT WHICH IT IS SO GET INTO THE TISSUES INSELVES THAT NEED IT MOST RIGHT SO T YOU KDON'T NOT HAVING ACTIVE TRANSPORT BUT RATHER PASSIVE TRANSPORT A SOEI THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING THE WAY BROKE THAT DOWN SO  YOU FYEW DIFFENT OPTIONS FOR THE VIGAN FOLKS OUT THERE YOU CAN USE AN ISOLATED SOURCE OF OF PROTINE AND AGAIN LIKE THOSE CAN BE GOOD OPTIONS COMING BECAUSE THIS PLANT BASED WAY S CAN TO BE A GREAT OTION FOR FOLKS I'M YOU CAN ADD FREE LOOSING TO IT TO WHATEVER YOUR SOURCE OF PROACHING IS JUST BY SUPPLEMENTED LUSING MY HOUSING NOW IT TASTE HORRIBLE YEI THINK IV HER THAT MAYBE HAVE EVEN TRIED IT A'S COMPLETELY NON PULLER DOES NOT DISSOLVE IN ANYTHING ISN'T A CAPITAL ROAST IT CAN'T BE PUT NO CAPISILS YE SO YOU COUND TAKE A CAPSIL LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOURE EATING YOUR NOMAL MEAL YOU COULD JUST TAKE A CAPSIL OF LIKE ONE GRAM OF LOSINE IS PUBLIC TO BUMP YOU OFF BUMP YOU UP ENOUGH THAT YOU'RE GONG TO BE GOOD TO GO M AND THEN THERE'S THERE'S OPTIONS LIKE IM BLENS ESPECIALLY WITH CORN CORN IS ACTUALLY VERY HIGH AND LOOSIG AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS PROTIG THEY GOT A REMEMBER LIKE YOU GON'T EAT CORN ON A COB AND YOU'RE GETING LIKE TWO GRAMS OF TOAL PROTING SO AS NOT THAT MUCH LOOSING BUT IF YOU ISOLATE OUT THE PROTINEG PUT INTO A POWDER WELL NOW YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GETTING  LIKE EIGHTY NINETY PER CENT OF THE WEIGHT IS NOW PROTING CORN IS ACTAL ABOUT TWELVE PER CENT LOOSING IN TERMS OF THE PROTING SO GREAT SORCE OF LOOSING IT IS LIKE ALMOST FRANK DEFICIENT SOME OTHER MEAL ASCIDS BUT YOU CAN BLEND IT WITH A FEW OTHER SOURCE OF PROACHING LIKE YOU COUL BLEND IT WITH A SOY AHA PE AND YOU CAN CREATE THESE COMPLIMENTARY BLENS THEY WOULD ACTALLY HAVE QUITE A BIT OF LOOSINE BUT ALSO SOMEOF HEOTHER ESSENTIAL ME TO LASCID SO THERE ARE OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR PLANT BASE FOLKS AND MAY WE HAVE SEENE PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANT BASED IM YOU DON'T BUILT IMPRESS OF BOUTS OF MUSCLE ERS QUITE A FEW BODY BOLERS OR PLANT BASED IUNDERANCE ATHLETS LIKE IT AND EVEN THOUGH IM WE TALE ABOUT MUSCLE WEETING ABOUT MUSCLE BUILDING OFT AND IM PERFORMANCE IN ENDURANT SPORTS AND ALSO JUST PERFORMANCE FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON WHO'S DOING SOME CARTY OF ASCULAR TRAINING HOOKFULLY SOME RESISTANCE TRAINING ALSO AND JUST LIVING LIFE I MIN MANY WONT PEOPLE NOW SEEMS ARE VEGIN AR AT LEAST OF WAITING MEAT IN PARTICULAR RED MEAT I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE I LIMIT THE AMOUNT AND I CERTAINLY FOCUS ON THE QUALITY OWHAT I BUT I DO RED MEAT WHICH BRINGS ME TO QUESTION IM ABOUT YOU KNOW JUST GENERALLY IN TERMS OF FOOD CHOICE YOU KNOW I CAN WE COME UP WITH A RELATIVELY SHORT SUMMARY AT OF THE FOLLOWING TELL ME F THIS IS IM CORRECT OR NOT THAT MOST OF US SHOULD BE FOCUSSED ON FOR FORSAKE OF HEALTH HEL SPAN IND LIFE SPEND IM SHOULD BE FOCUSSED ON IN JESTING MENIMALY NON PROCESS AN MINMLY PROCESS FOODS YOU AY BE EVEN COOKING OUR OWN FOOD YOU KNOW I REALIZE THAT'S HERESY NOW BUT IDEALY WE DO SOME OFTHAT AND AND REALLY TRYING TO AVOID FOODS THAT I'M OR HIGHLY PROCESSD AND HAVE LOTS OF SUGAR AND AMUSINGNUSS AS A SEGWAY TO GET INTO E QUESTION THAT I REALLY WANT YOUR ANSWER TO IVE BEEN DYING TO ASK YOU THIS WHICH IS IF A SUGAR IN TAKE IS NOT ACTUALLY GOING UP IM AS MUCH AS PEOPLE THINK IT IS WIRE PEOPLE GETTING SO MUCH FATTER I SO WHAT WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT U'M JUST A GENERAL STATEMENT THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND EAT FOODS THAT ARE LO TO NO MENTIMALLY TO NOT PROCESS FOR ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR FOODS IS THAT OF YES THE NUMBER IT'S HARD TOACTS YOU GET YOU NO COMPLETELY UNPROCESSE FOOD CAUSE ALMOST EVERYTHING GOES THROUGH SOME FROM A PROCESSINGS INKING AND  LIKE ONLYTHING IN WOULDN'T SURVIVE LONG IM ON WE O SHO FOR DRATS YE ON A SHELL LIKE THATE LIKE AN APPLE OTER BEANNERS OMEO LIKE GROUND OATS TO ME AS LONSERS IN A BUNCH OF OTHER SEVENTHEYEWOULD BE MINIMALY PROCESS  A A STAKE I'S NOT REALLY PROCESS ALTHOUGH IT'S CUT OFF THAT THE ANIMAL IT SA SO THERE'S H THERE'S A FEW STEPS IN THERE BUT AM THATS SORT THAT'S WHAT I'M YET NAND I THINK EVERYBODY KINDY GETS THE JIST II'M PROBABLY WILL BUT PEDANTIC WHEN IT COMES TO THE STUFF O TI IS GOOD O ON  THINGS I APPRECIE MATE APPRECIATE ABOUT YOU IS ON THAT I GET TEASE A LOT BY A PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME WHICH IS THE CAVIATS AND THE INSISTENTS ON PRECISION IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUS ESPECIALY WHEN ON LINE A COMMUNICATIONS THESE DAYS IS LIKE A RUN AWAY TRAIN YOU KNOW KNOW WHAT WILL YOU I'S TOO EASY TO MIS INTERPRET WHAT YOUR SAY VERY EASY MISINTERPRET AND THE MISINTERPRETATIONS ARE OFTEN USED TO LEVERAGE WHOLE NEW IDEAS ABOUT WHAT ISN'T ISN'T TRUE MUSTT ABOUT WHAT IS A SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE NEW AUNTS AND THIS IS WHAT A LONG FORM PODCASS FRALY ALLOWS US TO DO IS IS CATCH EVERY EVERY CURVE SO I WOULD A HUNDRED PRER CENT AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID THAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A BROAD STROKE THAT TRYING TO FOK US SOME MENLY PROCESS FOODS IS VERY IMPORTANT THE ONE CAVION I WOULD SAY IS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHY BECAUSE OTHERWISE PEOPLE CAN MAKE THIS WEARD ASSOCIATION THAT LIKE IF I EAT ANY MINTALY OR ANY PROCESS FOOD IT'S GOING TO KILL ME OR LIKE EVERY TIME I EAT IT IT'S LIKE AM SMOKING A CIGARETT MY HEALTH YOU KNOW MY LONG JEVITIES DECLINING BASED ON THE STUDIES WE HAVE IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT THE ENERGY THAT PROCESS FOOD JUST GETS PEOPLE TO SPONTANEOUSLY EAT MORE AND AND A KEVENHOLE SHOWED THIS AND HIS STUDY THAT WAS VERY HE DESIN SOME F TE MOST ELEGANT STUDIES IN NETRITION ISGRAY AND THEY BASICALLY TOOK PEOPLE FROM A MENLY PROCESS FOOD DIET AND THEN GAVE THEM ACCESS TO ULTRA PROCESS FOODS VER VERY FEW INSTRUCTION JUST EAT TO YOU FEEL SATISFIED AND THEY SPONTANEOUSLY INCREASE THEIR CALORY AND TAKE MY FIVE HUNDRED CALORYE TO DAY I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S MASSIVE SO THERE'S SOETHIN WE QUITE HAVEN' QUITE FIGURED IT OUT YOURE PEOPLE SO WALLS IS IT'S CAR ITS SUGAR IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE SUGAR IN TERMS ARE JUST AN ISOLATION I WEIT'S FATS THEN'T APPEAR TO BE FATS NICELYS WOST THE COMBINATION OF SUGAR AND FAT HARTLY WHAT'S THE COMMINATION OF SUGAR FAT AND SALT HARTLY BUT THERE'S SOME KIND OF LIKE OVERALL MAGIC TO THE TEXTURE AND THE MOUTH FEEL AN JUST OVERALL PALIDABILITY OF STUFF WHICH IS ALWAYS WHY I SAY THERE'S LIKE RIGHT AND WRONG WAY TO THSE DIFFERENT DIETS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LIK THOE'S RIGHT WAY DO PLANTBASE AND THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT'S IN SOME OF THSE DOCUMENTARIES WHERE THEY'RE EATING LIKE PLANTMAKES MACK AND CHEESE YOU KNOWHIT AGET I LOVE GOOD MACKA CHEES BUT LIKE THAT SHOULD NOT FORM LI THAT SHOULDNOT BE PITCHED IS A HEALTHY DIET JUST BECAUSE IT'S PLANT BASE RIGHT BECAUSE I MEAN YOU'RE EATING A HIGHLY PROCESS FOOD THAT'S VERY POLABLE AND EASY TO OVER EAT SAME THAING FOR KEETO YOU'VE NOW GOT LIKE KEETO ICE CREAMS AND YOU'VE GOT YU KNOW KEETO COOKIES AD ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS DOMLIKE Y AND IF YOU LOOK AT HIM TH EXTO HAVE MORE CALORIES THAN THE NORMAL STUFF AN UNLIKE YET T IS IS COMPLETELY MISSING THE POINT HERE LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY JUST TAKING YOURSELF LIKE THE WHOLE POINT OF THOSE DIETS IS THE REASON YOU TEN TO LOSE WEIGHT IS ORIGINALLY LIKE GOOD LUCK YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO DOING A KEETO DIET EATING PROCESS FOOD RIGHT LIKE YOU JUST COULDN'T DO IT REALLY NOW YOU CAN BUT THE PROBM IS IT'S NOT CAN TO WORK BECAUSEYOUR CON TO BE STILL CONSUMING TUMANY CALORIES BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S KEETO WHAT ARE THY DOING HETHER TRY TO MAKE IT MORE PALLABLE TOR TRY TO MAKE A BETTER MOUTH FEEL WHICH I GUES IF YOU'RE BEING KEETO FOR THE SAKE OF BEING KEETO GREAT BUT IF THERE'S IF YOU HAVE HOPES OF BODY COMPOSITION MODIFICATION HAT'S GOING TO YOU'RE REALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT SO YES I THINK MINIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF PROCESS FOOD YOU CON SOM CAN'T BE IMPORTANT NOW THAT BEING SAID IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR GOALS IF YOU'RE GOAL IS TO FOR EXAMPLE BUILD MUSCLE OR MAINTAIN A HIGH BODYWEIGHT FOR A SPORT FOR EXAMPLE LIKE AN INOUGFELL OFFENSE OF LINEMEN OR ORE SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE OR IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW I WORKED WITH A AN ENVIATEEN WHEN THEY WERE KIND OF I CAN'T DISCLOSE ANYTHING BUT THEY WERE LOOKING AT DRAFHTING A CERTAIN PLAYER I'M AND YOU KNOW LIKE FOR THEM PROCESS FOODS MAY ACTUALLY BE A TOOL OR A TEEN AGERS RYN'T WE ALL WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO EAT AN MORE HEALTHFULLY I THINK IT ALL GREAT HABITS BUT SOME OF THEM THEIR CLORIC MEES ARE SO HIGH SO HIGH THAT IF THEY WERE EATING WHAT I AN YE'RE GOING TO AM DISSOLVE INTO NOUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST WASTE AWAY SOI I I DESCRIBE THIS AGAIN WITH A FINANCIAL EXAMPLE ITS LIKE A BUDGET RIGHT SO IF I MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS YEAR FOR EXAMPLE I'M IS NO CAME FOR ME TO BUY LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND OLL RESPORTS UNCE ASSUMED AT LONESDON'T EXESTD RIGHT IS NO CAME FOR ME TO BUY A HUNDRED THOUSAND OLLAR SPORTS CAR IF I STILL 'M ABLE TO PAY MY MORTGAGE AND PAY MY UTILITIS AND LIKE TAKE CARE OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES THE THINGS I SHOULD DO IS NO CA IF I DO THAT IF IT LIKE MAKES ME FEEL GOOD AND IT'S FUN ON ME YES FINE RIGHT LIKE YOU FITS IN YOUR MUDGET IF MY IF I HAVE IF I MAKE YOU KNOW FIFTY GRAND A YEAR SHOULD I BE GOIN OUT AN YOU KNOW BUYING A SPORTS CAR PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE I'M NOT CAN BE ABLE TO PAY MY MORTGAGE AND ALL THSE OTHER RESPONSIBILITES FO YOUR YOUR PROACEEN YOU'R FIBER YOU'RE MY CENUTRANCE THESE YOURE RESPONSIBILITIES BUT THOSE BECOME MUCH EASIER TO HIT WHEN YOU HAVFE HIGHER CALORIES RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW EATING FOUR THOUSAND CALORIES TO DAY FOR WHATEVER GOAL YOU HAVE I'M YOU'RE PROBALY COULD HAVE SOME LEFT OVER AND LIKE GOOD LUCK EATING FOUR THOUSAND CALORIES FROM MENTALLY PROCESS FOODS YOU I QUITE FRANKLY YOU'LL BE MIS SERABLE BECAUSE YOUR YOUEGING HAVE SUCH GOT FILL THE YOU'REGING TO FILL LIKE YOU CAN'T EVEN MOVE AND SO AGAIN NOW IT BECOMES O CA WAS THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENT TO THAT FOOD PROCESSING IS THERE SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN PICK OUT WE KNOW O C WE THIS IS GOING TO BE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON HEALTH EVEN LIKE BODY COMPOSITION STUFF ASIDE AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S NOT REALLY GREAT EVIDENCE OF THAT SO FAR AND A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS SUGAR I MEAN I EXSHE JUST WROTE A REALLY LONG ARTICLE ON MY WEB SIDE ABOUT WHY I THINK SUGAR WAS NOT THE ROUTE CAUSE OF THE OBISINTY EPIDEMIC AND YOU KIND OF MENTION LIKE SUGAR AND TAKIN THE LAST WHEN YE RS ACTALY GONE DOWN WILL BUT I' AL ON TAKE WELL IF YOU LOOK ON THE WHOLE IT MIGHT HAVE GONE UP A LITTLE BIT BUT IT YOU KNOW CERTAIN AND CERTAINLY IN THE MAL SECTOR IT'S GONE WAY DOWN DRINKING USED TO BE FOR THERE WAS A FIVE O'CLOCK PEOPLE DRINKING ALL DAY NOW PEOPLERE SMOKING A LOT LESS AM THERE I THING IT'S A REAL PUZZLE I'D LEFT O KNOW WHAT YOU ARE AM AS MOKINS TO THAT COPY IN OP OPPOSITION BECAUSE NICOTINS ACTION APPETITES AT US ASN'T PRESSEND ALSO INCREASES FOKASS THE PROMISE IT OFTEN ARRIVES IN A DELIVERY DEVICE THAT CAN KILL YOU YE BUNKETING ITSELF IS A POWERFUL AGENT IT ALSO CAN OFFSET AGE RALLY COGNIVE DECOMP DECLINE NOT ENTIRELY BUT IT'S IT MAKES THE BRAIN WORK BETTER I'VE GOT A BODY WHO A DOESN'T LIKE CAFFIN AND HE JUST TAKES THOSE NICOTINE POUCHES AND LIKE BASIC WE HAS ONE AND ALMOST ALL DAY BECAUSE HE'S A LIKE A HE HAS A VERY TRUSTFUL JOB AND IS A HIGH PERFORMER YOU KNOW YET I'VV BEE CAREFUL HOW YOU DELIVER IT BUT IS A NOBOLE PRIZE WINING NOR A SCIENTISTS THAT I WILL CHEW FIVE OR SIX PIECES OF NICERET AN HOUR WHICH I DO NOT  COMMAND AN BUT WHEN HE QUIT SMOKING HE JUST SIMPLY COUN FUNCTION AS WELL AND HE KNOWS THE ONE WHO POINTED ME TO THE LITERATURE ON OFFSETTING AGE RELATED COGNIVE DECLINE AN NUR ON MAINTENANCE AND IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING IIT'S A PRETTY IT'S A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE NEUTROPIC THE OUT TO BE HONEST AM SO NOW THE FIRST THING IT REALIZES WE WERE TIME OUT CONSUMPTION DATA THIS IS BASED ON ACTUAL PRODUCTION BASICALLY THERE ASSUMING THAT O C WERE PRODUCING THIS AMOUNT OF THESE FOOD SO WE CAN ASSUME THE CONSUMPTION THAT CAN THE FALL THAT SO IT'S NOT A DIRECT MEASUREMENT A BUT IT HAS BEEN VALUE O THE FOU DIFFERENT STUDIES WE KNOW THE OIL CONSUMPTION HAS GONE UP LIKE THOT TAT' THAT'S THAT'S THE OT THAT'S ONE OF THE THE BIG ONES IS IN THIS KIND OF FORMS THE CRUKS OF LIKE THE THE SEADOILS OR VAAN LIKE THE ROOTE OF STEVING ON QUIAIN THAT I AN AE E O A YOU KNOW COME INTO YOR HOUSE AND KICK YOUR DOG AND YOU KNOW PUNCHER MOB AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF AH AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE BUT IM SO CALORIES HAVE STILL GONE UP A THE DEES SOME PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THAT THEY'VE GONE THEY'VE CON O PLATEAUD I THINK THE DAY DOES SEEMS TO SUGGEST TE CALLORY AND TAKE IS STILL INCREASING AND NHE NOTHING TO KEEP IN MIND IS EVEN IF IT'S PLATEAUD IT'S STILL A HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL THETO BESITYIS PUBLIC ON THE CONTINUE TO INCREASE UP TO A POINT WHERE  PLO PLATEAU IF CALLORIES ARE WHAT ABOUT ENERGY UT IM LEAVING ASIDE MEAT BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL I MEAN PEOPLE ARE THE PEOPLE WE KNOW ORE FOCASSING ON EXERCISE THERE'RE A LOT OF FOLKS T THOWI DON'T EXERCT AND AND AND ENERGY OUTPUT HAS GONE DOWN OVER THE AR SOME ININ AND IT'S VERY OBVIOUS WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW PEOPLE WORK NOW COMPARED TO EVEN YOU KNOW THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO IT'S IT'S MUCH DIFFERENT LESSIN AN TALKING ALSO I LEARNED RECENTLY THAT I'M GIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL DON'T TAKE PE CLASS IN MAY SCHOOLS PAN WE HAD TO SUIT UP AND RUN AND SET UP AND IF YOU DIDN'T BRING YOUR CHANGE OF CLOTHES OR YOU DIDN'T WASH THEM IN WHICH CASE YOU BE BETTER OFF TOS NOT WHERE I NOTHING LIKE THE SMELL OF A BOY'S LOCKEROOM AFTER A WEEK AND WO KNOW I AS CAN STILL REMEMBER IT AND IT'S NOT I'M IT'S NOT PLEASANT THAT YOU HAD TO RUN AND DO YOUR PUSH UPS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE ARE PLAY BOLLYBL IN YOUR IN YOUR REGULAR SCHOOLDAY CLOTHES SAY THAT I  MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PHYSICAL EDUCATION IS NOT PART OF THE THE BASIC EDUCATION ANY LONGER I BUY DEPENDS ON THE STATE BUT I I KNOW MANY STATES HAVE DONE AWAY WITH IT JUST ASE AF BUDGET CUTS SOR ACTIVITIES GOING DOWN COLERK AND TAKE ITS GOING UP MAYBE PLATSOINGLAME ABAT TOING IS THAT SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THE BE SITY EPADAMIC A TASTO WHAT I'VE SEEN IT I I THINK IT'S PRETTY SUFFICIENT SO IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT BIG OF A MISTERY AFTER ALL NO I NOW THEY GET'S A BIG MYSTERY I THINK THAT I'M PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE CONCEPT IF ENERGY BALANCE AND I THINK BECAUSE THEY INSERT JUDGMENT INTO IT WHICH IS OKI IF YOU'R GAINING WAYT OVER TIME AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL IT MEANS YOU ARE EATING YOU'RE CONSUMING MORE ENERGY THAN YOUR EXPENDING PEOPLE IN SERT THE JUDGMENT WHICH IS YOU'RE LAZY YOU'RE A SLOTH YOUR WHATEVER IT IS AND I THINK THERE'S A LO PEOPLE OUGHT THET WHO ACTALY THINK THAT I I HO REMEMBER TALKING TO SOMEBODY WAS LIKE WHY WOULD NEVER HIRE N OBEAST PERSON FOR A JOB BECAUSE IT'S JUST OBVIOUS THATH THE LAZY AND I JUSTREMEMBERED GOING ARE YOUSERIOUS LIKE THERE ARE PLENTY OF VERY VERY SMART HIGH ACHIEVING PEOPLE WHO ARE OBEES AN TIKE IT'S NOT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU JUST PUT PEOPLE IN BUCKETS YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS YES THERE'S THERE IS SOME REAND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOKTHOUGH THE DATA AND YOU LIKE TAKE OTHERE IS A STUDY DONE AND OBE SWOMEN WHEN THEY FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO WERE A BEASTS WERE FIFTY PER CENT MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HAD SOME FORM OF SEXUAL ASALT TRAMA IN THEIR PAST RIGHT IM WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE FROM LOWER INCOME AREAS ARE MORE PRONE TO BE OBEES I'M THERE'S SEVERAL LIKE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HIGHER A SCORE I BELIEVE WHICH IS KIND OF MEASURES LIKE TRAMATIC CHILDHOOD EVENTS I BELIEVE THER THERE IAS A STUDY SHOWING THEM MORE LIKELY TO BE OBEES SO THERE'S YES IT IS AN ENERGY IN BALANCE PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW JUST SAYING EAT LESS MOVE MORE THAT'S LIKE TELLING BROKE PEOPLE WILL JUST EAREN'T MORE MONEY THAN YOU SPENT IT'S RTECHNICALLY RIGHT BUT IT'S VERY UN HELPFUL RIGHT WHAT IS MORE HELPFUL IS TO DESCR I AND IMPLEMENT THE HABITS AND BEHAVIORS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO ACHIEVE THAT RIGHT SO KIND OF I REALIZED WE KONDING OFF TRACKLU OF IT CIRCLING BACK TO LIKE SUGAR STIRK A TWO THOUSAND FIVE I BELIEVE THAT SUGAR WAS FATTENING AND BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH INDEPENDENT OF ANY OTHER VARUABLE SO INDEPENDNT RUSFACTOR AND AGAIN I WON'T BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT INDEPENDENT MEANS INDEPENDENT MEANS INDEPENDENT OF ALL O THER VARIABLES THIS THING IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND A BODY COMPOSITION SO ON ITS OWN INDEPENDENT OF WEATHER R NOT FOR INSTANCE EATING REASIS HUNGER AND APPETITE RIGHT OR OR CALORIC INTAKE RIGHT I WAS IN A GRADUATE SCHOOL MIXOR AND ONE OF THE PROFESSORS THERE WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAD DONE RESEARCH ON HYFRICTOS CORN SURUP AND FRUCTOS SPECIFICALLY AS WELL AND HE WAS TALKING TO ANOTHER PROFESSR AND HE HAD DONE THIS STUDY IN A ROTES WHERE YOUD FED LIKE  THINKIT WAS LIKE SIXTY OR SEVENTY PER CENT OF THEIR CALLORIES FROM FRUCTOS AND THEY SAW SOME REALLY WEIRD THINGS HAPPENED IN THE LIVER WITH THE NOVA LIEAGENESIS AND ALL THISCETISTOFF AND THE OTHER PROFESSOR IS SAYING TO HIM YET'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT HYFRICTOS CORN SURUP IS YOU KNO FATTENING AND THIS PROFESSOR WHO HAD DONE THIS RESEARCH SAID YA BECAUSE IT'S PEOPLE READ AND AS I DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENT TO IT  HE SAID NOW I THINK IT JUST CALLORIES BE WEREATING TO MANY CALLORIES HE'S LIKE WE WE DID A PROOF OF CONSEPT LOOKING IT YE COULD WE LIKE TRY EATING OM SEVENTY PRERCENTNYOUR DAILY CALLARSE FROM FRUCTOS YOU ACTULLY CAN'T DO IT LIKE HYFRICTOS CORN SURP IS ONLY FIFTY FIVE PER CENT FRUCTOS SO IF YOU AITE NOTHING BUT HYFRIC TOS CORN SURP YOU WOULD STILL NOT GET TO THIS LEVEL THAT THEY FED IN THIS STUDY SO THAT GOT ME KIND OF LIKE QUESTIONING MY BELIEFS ABOUT IT SO THEN I WENT THROUGH AND I SANT OKE LIKE LET'S TAKE OUT THE EPOTYMEOLOGY NOT THAT EPOTYMIOLOGIES USELESS BUT PEOPLE WHO EAT MORE SUGAR ARE ALSO LIKELY EAT MORE CALORIES SO THEN I LOOKED FOR THE RANDOBISES CONTROL TRIALS WERE THEY YOU DON'T MATCH CALORIES AND VARY THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT LEAST FROM FAT LOSS OR FAT GAIN BUT WHAT ABOUT HEALTH SO FOR INSAS IF SOMEBODY OM AND I KNOW SOMEBODY LIKE THIS WHO EAT LOVES SWEETS IS THIN GET SOME EXERCISE NOT ATON BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THEIR CALLORIES ARE COMING FROM THESE SUGARY FOODS AND THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH FIBER RI PUMAY BE PROTEINE ET CETERA SO LET'S LOOK AT EPOTMIOLOGY FOR A SECOND AND I'LL ADDRESS THIS MORE DIRECTLY WE LOOK AT EPTYMEOLOGY PEOPLE WHO EAT HIREAMOUNTS OF SUGAR TEN TO BE MO MORO BEAST THEY SAID TO HAVE WE KNOW WORST BYLMARKERS OF HEALTH TUT PEOPLEWHO EAT FRUIT A LOT OF FRUIT SUGAR DON'T HAVE THOSE SAME ASSOCIATION SO WHY IS THAT AS FRUIT HAS FIBER WITH IT RIGHT SO I STARTED TO KIND OF BELIEVE THEY SOM THE DATA I WAS LOOKING AT THAT HIGH SUGAR AND TAKE WAS NOT THE PROBLEM PER SAY THE PROBLEM WAS THAT HIGH SUGARY FOODS TYPICALLY ARE VERY LOW AN FIBRE BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH FIBRE IS SUGAR OR PROBLEM SO THERE AS A CLASSIC STUDY O BY SURWIT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN I THINK IT' STILL THE BEST STUDIES OF THIS DAY LOOKING AT THIS I KNOW THAT PEOPLE SAY WHALL WAS DONE NIGHE TO NIGHT TO SEVEN HESTO RELEVANTS YOU KNOW I KNOW IF IT'S A GOOD STUDY IT'S A GOOD STUDY I SOMESDAYS ER TIME WENCE HAN IF IKE THEY HAVE GREANTER N GO BACK AND UNDO THE DISCOVERY OF D NA CAUSE IT WAS YOU KNO SIXTY YEARS AGO WHATEVER IT IS SO THEY THEY LOOKED AT AN ELEVEN HNDRED CALORY DIETS O LOCALRY DIET ONE GROUP WAS EATING OVER A HUNDRED TEN GRAMS OF SUGAR A DAY LIKE SUCROS THE OTHER GROUP WAS EATING ABOUT TEN GRAMS OF SUGAR PERDAY CALORIES PROTINE CARBS FATS ALL MATCHED RIGHT AND THEY PROVIDED ALL THE MEALS TO THESE PARTICIPANTS SO VERY TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AND IT WAS OVER SIX WEEKS BOTH GROUPS LOST THE EXACTS AMOUNTABODY FAT SO DOESN'T SEEM AMOUT OF FOR BODY COMPOSITION IN TERMS O LIKE SUGAR PER SET THEN THEY ALSO LOOKED AT SOME BILEMARKERS OF HEALTH LIKE BLOOD LIPPIDS AND YOU KNOW BLOOD SUGAR AND SOME OTHER THINGS AGAIN THERE WAS NO REAL DIFFERENCES OF THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS SO ALL THE BILEMARKIS IMPROVED IN BOTH GROUPS THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE WAS A SMALL DIFFERENCE IN ELDIEL SO THE GROUP EATING LOW SUGAR HAD A BETTER IMPROVEMENT SLIGHTLY IN ELDIL AND BUT THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE EATING ORE FIBRE AND WE KNOW FIBER CAN YOU'LL BIND A CLUSTER ON LOWER ELDIO CLUSTRON SO IS NOW WANT UP I WANT A CAVIOT THIS SUGAR PROBABLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY LIKE POSITIVE HEALTH OF FACTS SO THERE'S THAT RIGHT AND AND NUTRICIAN IS AN EXCHANGE IF YOU'RE EATING ONE THING YOU'RE NOT EATING ANOTHER THING RIGHT SO I BUT WHAT I WOULD TELL PEOPLE IS FOCUS PROBABLY LESS ON SUGAR FOCUS MORE ON FIBRE SO IF YOU'RE EATING THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY GRAMS OF FIBRA DAY BUT YOU'R SUGARS YOU KNOW EIGHTY NINETY GRAMS I I WOULD NOT BE THAT WORRIED ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE CONTROLLING CALORIES AS WELL AYOU KNW WHAT I WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT IS IF YOU'RE EATING YOU KNOW JUST A DECENT AMOUNT OF CALORIES AND NOT GETTNG ANOUGH FIBR AND IN GENERAL RIGHT AND EVEN IN STUDIES THERE'S A FEW METANALOSIES OUT NOW LOOKING AT ICO ENERGETIC EXCHANGE OF DIFFERENT CARBAL HYDRATES WITH SUGAR CARBA HYDRATES SO FRUCTOS AND GLUCOS AND SUGROS NOW WHISE IS IMPORTANT WELL AGAIN YOUW IF YOU'RE NOT EQUITE WHEN I SAY ICO ENERGETIC THAT MEANS EQUAL IN ENERGY EQUAL IN CALORIES SO BASICALLY WHEN THEY EXCHANGE EITHER SUCROS OR GLUCOS OR FRUITTOS FOR OTHER FORMS OF CARBAL HYDRATE DO THEY SEE DIFFERENCS IN THESE SMARKERS OF HEALTH LIKE EIGH B ONE SEE A FASTING BUD GLUCOS NBLOOD LIPPIDS AND WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS AND I I CAN'T MEMBER ALL THE DAY TO POINTS EXACTLY BUT THE TO TAKE HOME IS DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW BEFORE ANYBODY OUT THERE STRAW MAN'S BY ARGUMENT I AM NOT ADVOCATING FOR SUGAR CONSUMPTION BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO NOT CREATE WHERET ASSOCIATIONS IN THEIR MINDS BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE OBSERVED SPECILLY THE FITNESS INDUSTRY IS WHEN PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T EAT SOMETHING LIKE I IT'S ONE THING IF YOU SAY I AM CHOOSING NOT TO EAT THIS JUST BECAUSE I'M CHOOSING TO BUT 'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING WHEN YOU'RE PURPOSELY RESTRICTING BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IS BAD AND THIS THIS ME YOU KNOW THE HUMAN BRAIN IS IN MANY WAYS AMAZING IN MANY WAYS REALLY DUMB A SO WHEN YOU PURPOSELY TRY TO RESTRICT SOMETHING BUT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS YOURE MORE PRONE TO BENGE ON IT SO PEOPLE WHO WILL TRY TO WHILE I'M NEVER GOIN TO EAT YOU OW SUGAR AGAIN OR I'M N O TRYING LIMIT SUGAR THIS ISN'N THE CASE FOR EVERYBODY BUT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY SHOW NOW IN STUDIES PEOPLE WHO ARE PURPOSELY RESTRICTING A SPECIFIC NEUTRIANT THEY TEND TO CRAVE BORE THAT NEUTRIAT AND IF THEY DO GET EXPOSED TO IT THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A DISINIBITION REFLECTS WHICH IS BASELY ABENGE RESPONSE BECAUSE THE THINKING GOES WHILE THIS IS BAD ANY AND THERE'S NO CONTEXT ON YOU KNOW DOSAGE MAKING THE POISON THIS IS JUST BAD IN GENERAL SO IF I HAVE IT I'VE ALREADY SCREWED UP I MIGHT AS WELL JUST HAVE AS MUCH AS I WANT AND I LIKE A SPENCION ODULSKIS COMPARISONIS IS  NO THAT'S LIKE YOU'LL GETTIG A FLAT AND GO OUT SLASHING YOUROTHER THREE TIRES BECAUSE YOU OW YOU MIGHT AS WELL SO IM I REALLY I TRY TO COME FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE OF I'VE SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH YOU KNOW MAY BE NOT AND EATING DISORDER BUT DISORDER TO EATING PATTERNS BECAUSE OF THESE KIND OF ASSOCIATIONS THEY'VE MADE IN THEIR MIND AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M SO PEDANTIC AND A STICKLER ABOUT SAY OH YE YES IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO YEL THE MENALLY PROCESS FOOD AND TRY TO AVOID PROCESS FOODS BUT NOT BECAUSE PROCESS FOODS ARE BAD PERSAY BUT WHAT THE OUT COME TENDS TO BE FROM A LOT OF PROCESS FOOD CONSUMPTION WHICH IS OVER CONSUMING CALORIES AND THEN THEREFORE YOU KNOW ENERGYTOCCICITY NEGABLY CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR HEALTH YET SEEMS TI GET AGAIN RETURNS THIS THE A POTENTIAL FOR A POSITIVE NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL BEHAVIOR AL CHANGE AND PERCEPTIONAL CHANGE OF LIKE CRAVING OF FOOD ALL THE TIME THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE AS IS TERRIBLE IT'S A TERRIBLE STATE TO BEGIN AND A THIS I THINK IS A PERFECT SAGWAY FOR SOMETHING THAT FIRST BROUGHT US TOGETHER WHICH O WHICH YOU IS TISNESSING ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AND  LETME JUST A FOR THE RECORD A BE VERY CLEAR I HAVE LONG INGESTED FOODS WITH ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS SO I THROUGHOUT GRADUATE SCHOOL I DIDN'T HAVE THE BEST HABITS THER HEALTHIER NOW THAN THEY WERE BECK THAN BUT I WOULD DRINK YOUW I COKER TO PER DAY I STILL HAVE THE OCCASIONAL I COK I'M NOT COMPLETELY AM A VERSE TO U TO DRINK SOMETHING THAT HAS ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER U ALTHOUGH I DO AVOID SUCROLOS FOR REASONS THAT MAY BE I UM GET INTO LOBIT LATER BUT A LOT OF THE THINGS I CONSUME CONTAINED STEVIA WHICH IS NOT ARTIFICIAL PLANT BUT IT IS A PLANT BASE NON COLORICSLEIN ER LOCOLLERK SWEETNER U AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THACT I BECAN VERY INTERESTING ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS BECAUSE OF THE ANIMAL DATA I'M POINTING TO THE IDEA THAT THEY MAY DISTRUPT THE GA MICROBUM AND THEN DISRUPT THE GOT ROM I CORBYUM AS YOU POINTED OUT AS A VERY BROAD STATEMENT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE PERCENTRES OF LACKED O BASILIS AT O BASILIS OF WHATEVER BASILA WHATEVER SILIS A ILLIS IN THERE OM THE ALL SEEM TO END IN ILLIS UM IS IDEAL AND IN FACT A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVING PEOPLE SEND IN THERE A STOOL SAMPLES FOR ANALYSIS OF THE MICROBYOM I MEAN TAKE NOTE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A HEALTHY MICROBYUM LOOKS LIKE BUT WE KNOW WHAT AN UNHEALTHY MICROBYUM MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND IT'S ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF DIVERSITY IN THERE SO I WAS INTERESTED IN THAT THEN THERE'S THE RECENT HUMAN STUDY WHICH I WE SHOULD DEFFLLY GET IN TO BUT I WAS MOSTLY INTERESTING ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS FOR THE REASON THAT THERE IS THIS UM FOOD CONDITIONING A FACT AND YOU SEE IT IN ANIMALS ING YOU SEE IT INHUMANS THAT IF YOU INJEST UM WILL COFFEES ARE REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE COFFEE DOESN'T ACTUALLY TASTE GOOD FOLKS EVEN THOUGH I LIKE IT BUT WHEN YOU TASTE COFFEE FOR THE FIRST TIME MOST PEOPLE THINK IT'S BITTER IN DISGUSTING MOST EVERYBODY NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAY THIS DOESN'T TASTE GOOD WHYER   BUT PEOPLE LEARN TO ASSOCIATE THE STATE OF BEING CALFINATED WHICH MOST PEOPLE LIKE IN ORDER TO JUST FEEL NORMAL I HAVINGS ON THE FEW DRUGS WE AN JUST JUST TO FEEL OURSELVES UM ENOUGH THAT SOON MYSELF INCLUDED REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO AN ENJOY A CUP OF COFFEE IT'S SO IT'S A POWERFUL EXAMPLE IN MY OPINION OF THE FOOD CONDITIONING A FACT SO IT'S LIKE A PAVYLOVIAN THINGS IF SALIVATING YOU CRAVE RI UM AND IT DID SEEM THAT THIS STUDY FROM DAIN A SMALL SLAB WHICH MIDLY WAS A SMALL NOPON INTENDED STUDY ITSELF NOT VERY MANY SUBJECTS SHOW THAT IF YOU INJESTED ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS ALONG WITH FOOD THAT CONTAINED GLUECOST THAT YOU COULD SOR I MABEVEN GET A HEIGHTENED GLUECOSTS RESPONSE JUST FROM THE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AFTER A WHILE YOU AND I UM CONNECTED OVER THIS STUDY ON SO CHOMETA YOU POINTED OUT THAT THE IF THAT THIS DESIGN THE STUDY WASN'T SUPERB THERE WAS UM THERE WILL  CO COCO CONSUMPTION OF GLUECOST WHICH MADE IT COMPLICATE WE CAN GO INTO THAT BUT THE REASON I'M SPOUTING OFF ALL THIS CONTECT IS ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS ARE MANY THINGS SO I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EFFECTS ON BLOOD SUGAR IN THE ACUE SENSE AND ACCORDING TO WHAT WE MIGHT INJEST THEM WITH WHAT AND HOW THEY MIGHT BE CHANGING BLOOD SUGAR REGULATION AT THE LEVEL BRAIN ENDER A BODY AND THEN THOUGH GOT MICROBYUM DATE I THINK ARE INTERESTING ENOUGH TO DISGUST AND I HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW ON ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE TAUGHT ME SO THIS IS A CASE WHERE I'VE COMPLETELY CHANGED MY VIEW WHICH IS THAT UM NOW I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH TH WHAT SOEVER BASED ON THE CURRENT DATA WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT I'M YOU KNOW GULPING DOWN CUPFULLS OF SUIM BUT I FEEL OC IN JESTING SOME STEVIA AND SOME ASPERTAIN AND I'M NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT IT SO I I THINK CON STEPPING BACK FROM A BROAD VIEW WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AGAIN THE HIEARCHY OF IMPORTANCE AND WHAT ARE YOU REPLACING WITH  SO THERE IS NO SITUATION WHERE IT IS NOT A NET POSITIVE TO TAKE SOMEBODY WHO DRINK SUGAR SWEETEN BEVERAGES AND HAVE THEM DRINK AN ARTIFICIALLY SWEETEN BEVERAGE LIKE THE IN THE MEDANALYSIS R WAS LICY RECENT NETWORK MET ANALYSIS LOOKING AT LIKE ATAM MARKERS ABOUTAPOSITY IM YOU H B ONE SEE A BUNCH DIFFENT HEALTH MARKERS AND WHEN YOU SUBSTITUTE YOU KNOW WE'LL CALL IT NON NUTRITIVE SWEETENERS SINCE STEVIA IS NOT ARTIFICIAL BUT SO WHEN YOU SUBSTITUTE IN AN S FOR THE SUGAR SWEETEN BEVERAGES YOU SEE IMPROVEMENTS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS K WHAT WAS REALY INTRESTING ABOUT THIS NETWORK MET ANALYSIS WAS THEY ALSO LOOKED AT WATER SUBSTITUTION IN PLACE OF SUGAR SEETEN BEVERAGES AND THE EFFECT WASN'T AS POWERFUL AS IN THESE ARE RANDOMIZE CONTROL TRIALS SO ARTIFICIAL SWEET NER CONTAINING BEVERAGES ARE MORE BENEFICIAL WERE WERE WERE BETTER FOR ATAPOSITY FOR IMPROVING ATAPOSITY AND THEN IN E HEALTH MARKERS IF AS KIND OF A WASH WATER AND IM WATER AND ANON NUTRITIVE SWEETENER BEVERAGES PERFORMED A SIMILAR BUT THEYE WARE BETTER THAN SUGAR SEETEN MEVERAGE'S OBVIOUSLY SO THEY THEN BASED ON A NETWORK METANALYSIS IS KIND OF WORD YOU CAN ACOMPARE TWO THINGS THAT DIDN'T GET COMPARED DIRECTLY SO THERE'S NOT MANY STUDIES COMPARING IN AN S FOR SIS WATER DIRECTLY BUT IF YOU HAVE A COMMON COMPARATOR SO IF YOU COMPARE ATA BE AND BE GETS COMPARED TO SEE YOU CAN PARE ATASY BASED ON HOW THEY INTERACTED WITH BE BUTHERING IT A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE CRUX OF A NETWORK MET ANALYSIS SO THEY LOOKED AT A IN AN S VERSES WATER AND FOUND THAT ACTUALLY IN AN S WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER FOR IMPROVING ATAPOSITY AND AN S OF COURSE BE NON NUTRITIVE SWEEENER ISO NOW AGAIN I'M I IF YOU LIKE DRINKIN WATER AND YOU YOU DON'T WANT I'M NOT TRYIN TO CONVINCE ANYBODY TOO DO THAT WHAT THAT SEEMS TO SUGGEST IS THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN APPETITE SUPPRESSIN EFFECT FROM THESE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS OR NON NUTRITIVE SWEETNERS NOW THIS GETS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IF THESE WERE PEOPLE DRINKING  SUGAR SWEETEN BEVERAGES MAYBE DHEV ALREADY DEVELOPED THE SWEET TASTE AND TRYNG TO GO TO WATER IS TOO MUCH OF A JUMP FOR THEM AND SO GOING TO HAVING SOMETHING LIKE INTERMEDIATE IS A  BUT BETTER LIKE THERE'S A LOT WRAPPED UP IN THIS BUT THESE ARE THE RANDOMIZE CONTROL TRIALS WHICH ARE A LITT BUT MORE TIGHLY CONTROLLED WHICH I I TEND TO DEFAULT TO A LITTLE BUT MORE THAN I DO THE EPOTYMEOLOGY WHICH EPOTYMEOLOGIES TO SO MESSY BECAUSE SURE U KNOW NOT NUTRITIVE SWEETENER CONSUMPTION MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT THINGS BUT THERE'S ALSO A WHOLE NOTHER SET OF LIFE STYLE ON HABITS THEY'RE TIED UP IN THAT SO I TEND TO HANG MY HANDLILIT MORE ON TH ROUN TO ASK CONTROL TRALS SO UNDERSTANDING THAT OQUET NOW ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A TOOL THAT MAY HELP SOME PEOPLE AND WHENEVER I POST ABOUT NONDRUTES OVE SWEETENERS IN THE COMMENTS THERE'S ALWAYS ONE OR TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WHO SAY ALL I DID WAS CUT OUT SODA AND I DRANK DIETSOT INSTEAD NO LOST FIFTY POUNDS I LOST SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS I EVEN HAVE ONE PER SALOST A UNDRED POUNDS THAT'S THE ONLY THING I DID WELL I MEAN THAT' THE PRETTY MASS OF LEVER TO PULL IF YOU CONSIDERS SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE HAVING LIKE I MEAN FIVE OR SIX COKS TO DAY I MEAN THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING IS SERIOUS AMOUT A CALLERIES AND THAT ALSO MEANS THAT BY REPLACING WITH TH ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER CONTAINING BEVERAGES THEY DID NOT REPLACE THE SODA WITH FOOD CORRECT SO LIKE LET'S NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT RIGHT THIS IS WHERE WE CAN GET INTO THE MICRONALYSIS BUT IS THAT OBY'S PERSON WHO LOST A HUNDRED POUNDS BY DOING THAT DO I REALLY CARE ABOUT MAY BE A SMALL ALTERATION TO THEIR BEGOT MICROBYUM NOW BECAUSE THE'RE GOT MICRO BY M IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE HEALTHY NOW BY THEM HAVING LOST ALL THAT EXCESS OUTIPOST TISSUE SO AGAIN THE RANKING OF WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU KNOW CAN CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC SITUATION NOW LET'S TAKE SOMETHING LIKE ME WHOSE LEAN AM AND DOESN'TREALLY HAVE U NO ANY HEALF PROMISE I'M AWARE OF AM WHAT ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS FOR ME WELL FOR ME I KIND OF GOT USING THEM BECAUSE OF BODY BUT IN CONTEST PREP BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT THE ONLY APPETITES SUPPRESSET THAT WORKE FOR ME AM BUT DO I THINK THAT THEY ARE HEALTH FULL PROBABLY NOT A DO I THINK THE'RE UNHEALTHY I WOULD SAY BASE ONE THE CURRENT DATA I DON'T THINK THAT THE'RE UNHEALTHY NOW THE INFORMATION ON BLOOD LUCOS SO THERE THERE'S SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF THESE MEN ANALYSIES OR THESE THESE REVIEWS IS THE CUT A LUMP ALL THE NONNUTRITIVE SWEETNERS TOGETHER AND THEN THEY MAY SAY WHELE THERE'S NO EFFECT ON THIS THAT AES AN EFFECT ON THIS WHILE THE PROBMIS IS THESE PROBABLY ARE DIRTLIES ARE DIFFERENT MOLECULES THAN THEY CAN INTERACT DIFFERENTLY ASPERTAING VERY CLEARLY SEEMS TO HAVE NO EFFECT ON BLOOD SUGAR OR INSOLENT A THAT HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY SHOWN AM STEVIA DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT SACREN AND SUCRILOS THAT THE JURY IS KIND OF MIXED NOW THERE WAS THE STUDY THAT WE FIRST CONNECTED ON WHICH A I THINK THEI'RE PRIMER OUTCOME MEASUREAS ACTUALLY THEY WERE LOOKING IT LIKE KIND OF HF SWEET TASTE LIKE HOW IT AFFECTED SWEET TASTE SO WHAT THEY DID WAS THE GROUP THAT WAS GETTING THE SUCROLOS WAS ALSO PARED WITH MULTODEXTRON THE CONTROL GROUP WAS GETTING SUCROS WHICH THE IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO COMPARE THE SWEET TASTE BECAUSE MULTODESTRON IS NOT AS SWEET AS SUCROS SO WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO COMBINE YOU KNOW SUCRELOSHS WHICH IS ALREADY SWEET WITH ANOTHER FORM OF CROBERHIRAT YOU'D WANT SOMETHING LESS SWEET COMPARED TO YOUR CONTROL BUT FOR THE OUTCOME MEASURE OF A INSOLENT AND BLOOD BLUE COST PROBABLY NOT AS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE WE KNOW MULTODESTRON HAS A MUCH HIHER GLYSEMIC INDEX THAN SUCRO SIT SO THEY THEY APPROPRIATELY CONTROLLED FOR FOR TASTE BUT NOT FOR THE EFFECT OF THE THE SWEET NERS AND I THINK THAT THA WAS IA KEY COMPON IT AND I THINK YET THET THE PART OF THAT STUDY THAT INTRIGUED ME I'M ACTUALLY WAS I'M IN A TALK VERSION OF THAT BECAUSE AT THAT STUDY DROVE ME TO WATCH A TALK THAT AND WELL GET DAN A SMALL ONE ON THE POGGASA SOME POINT  HOPEFULLY WAS THAT THEY HAD THEY HAD KIDS DO THIS STUDY AND THEY  SHAD TO CEASE THE STUDY BECAUSE A COUPLE OF THE KIDS BECAME PREDI A BAD ECHAMEIT SEEM LIKE THERE WERE SOLTHING HAZARDOUS ABOUT THIS IS A YALE SCHOOL MEDICINE'S GOOD PLACE OM MING YOU KNOW HAVE YOU KON THERS IM ARRANGE EVERYWHERE BUT I IT JUST SEEM LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SWEET TASTE THAT IF TAKEN TO THE EXTREME MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMPACT BLOOD SUGAR TO THIS IS IMPACTED AM MY  SORT OF BEHAVIOUR IN I TRYING TO I TRY TO AVOID REALLY SWEET THINGS UNLESS THERE EXCEPTIONALLY DELICIOUS OR THE OCCASION CALLS FOR THEM BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT IT INCREASES MY CRAVING FOR SWEET THINGS WE IT MIGHT NOT BE NECILY ACCRAVING BUT IT JUST PROGRAMES YOU SO SO LUT'S YOUR TASTE BUDS ARE EXTREMELY ADAPTABLE SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE IM LIKE INDIAN FOOD IF YOU BRING LIKE INDIAN PEOPLE OVER TO AMERICA AND HAVE THEM EATS SO MORE FOOD THEY THINK IT TASTE EXTREMELY BLAND BECAUSE THEY ARE USED TO SUCH SPICY FOOD THAT UNLESS THEY HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL SPICELEY HARDLY EVEN TASTID IF YOU EVER DONE A HIGH SODIUM DIET AND THEN GONE TO A LOW SODIUM DIET YIT FEELS VERY BLAND THAT'S A STALET BUT YOUR YOUR OVER TIME YOUR TASTEBUD TO JUST SO SWEET IS THE SAME THING IF YOU'RE USED TO EATING A LOT OF SWEET IM YOU GET KIND OF DECENSITIZE TO IT AND THEN IF YOU GO TO SOMETHING LESS SWEET I IK CAN KIND OF I TASTE BLAND AT FIRST OVER TIME IT'LL GET BETTER BUT SO I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION RIGHT LIKE IF SOMEBODY'S O BES AND THEY SAID WELL THIS IS GOING TO HELP ME YOU DON'T ELIMINATE SUGAR SWEET EN BEVERAGE LIK WHY WOULD YOU WNT TO TAKE THAT TOOL AWAY FROM M LIKE THAT'S A A GREAT LEVER TO PULL I MEANE OF SOMEBODY CAN LOSE LITTERALLY A HUNDRED POUNDS FROM JUST ONE CHANGE IN LIFESTALL THAT'S NOT EVEN REALLY THAT INCONVENIENT OF A CHANGE THAT'S THAT IS POWERFUL BUT AGAIN IS IT THE MOST HEALTHY THING THEY CAN DO AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT TENDS TO GET ASKED WE DON'T KNOW IS IT HEALTHY ER THE WATER PROBABLY NOT MAY BE AS HEALTHY AS IT WHO KNOWS NOW THE BUT I REALLY MAKE ALL THOSE CAVIOTS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO COULD USE THIS IS A TOOL THINK WAL TH I CAN'T DO THIS CAUS IT'S ACCHY BAD FOR ME RIGHT IF IT HELPS YOU LOSE FIFTY POUNDS OR SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS OR WHATEVER IT IS IT TRUST ME ITS NOT BAD FOR YOU RIGHT WHAT DOES HEM TO INCREASIN ATINY SIGNALS WOATD YOU THINK ABOUT THE MICROBIUM EFFECTS IN THIS RENCENT STUDY IS THE RECENT STUDY I THINK HAD SOME NICE FEATURES TO IT  AND YOU'VE DONE A DETAILED AM DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDIYES SOR FOR THOSE THAT ANS IT ASK  IS THIS TWO WEEKS STUDY WERE THES YO TING STUDY YE AND WEILL PROVIDEED LINK YOU DID AN EXCELLENT VITEO ON THIS ON YOUR YEU TWO CHANNEL THAT REALLY PARSES EACH BEESE BUT THEY COMPARED THE VARIOUS ARTIFICIAL SEETENERS UM AND LOOKED AT THE GLUCOS RESPONSE LOOKED AT MICROBYUM A NUMBER DIFFERENT MEASURES WHAT WAS YOUR GENERAL IAND THIS WAS IN HUMANS FOR THE FOR I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKING AT MICROBYUM IN HUMANS YOU DARIFICIAL SWEETENER THERE'S IT IS THERE ARE FEW STUDIES ON THE MICROBYUM IN HUMANS WITH ARTIFICIAL SWEETNRS THE FIRST TWO THAT CAME OUT SHOWED PRETTY MUCH NO EFFECT A BUT THEY WERE LO A SHORTER N DURATION THEY LIKE TWO TO FOUR WEEKS AND AGAIN AT DEPENDSI LIKE WHAT WHAT MACTERIAR GETTING MEASURED RIGHT LIKE THES YOU KNOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF MACTERIA SO THEY COULD JUST BE MEASURING ONE THAT DIDN'T CHANGE AND THEN THERE WAS A TEN WEEK STUDY THAT CAME OUT THE THEY GOT A LOT O PRESS A AND THEY SHOWED I THINK IT WAS SUQUELOS I THINK THEY SHOWED AN EFFECT OF CHANGE ON THE GOT MICROBYUM NOW WHAT WAS INTERESTING US WHEN I WENT INTO THE SPECIES THAT CHANGE THE THE SPECIES THAT CHANGE THE MOST COMPARED THE CONTROL WAS A SPECIES CALLED AM A BUTCHER THE TAM BUT LOOKS LIKE BLOUDY A COCOITUS I THINK IT'S I I MUST SAY FOR THOSE THAT WORK ON THE MICROBYUM IT IS IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO FER NOUNCE AN YOU NEEDNA NOMINCLATUR COMMITTEE AND YOU NEED ACRONAMSE SAONO ALREADY YOUR KILLING US O BESE THAT ANL EASY THANK YOU WORK IN A START THE NOMEN GLACER COMMITTI T YOU DON'T DO IT SOON SO THEY THEY NOTICE THAT THIS WENT UT BY LIKE THREE TO FOUREFOLD SO I I KIND OF WENT DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE ON THIS INTERESTINGLY THAT PARTICULAR SPECIES F BACTERIAS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ATAPOSITY BETTER INSOLENT SENSITIVITY AND PEOPLE WHO ARE O BES IN CHILDREN WHO ILL BES TEN T HAVE LESS OF IT SO I SAID WELL BAST ON THAT STUDY YOU CALN ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT MAY BE SUCRELOS ACTUALLY IMPROVE THAT GOT MICROBYUM NOW GET I'M NOT MAKING THAT CLAIM BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHAT A HEALTHY MICROBIUM LOOKS LIKE ALREADY WHAT THIS LAST STUDY THAT CAME OUT MY MY BIGGEST TAKE HOME WAS I THINK IT SAFE TO SAY THAT SOME OF THESE NON NUTRITIVE SWEETNERS ARE NOT METABOLICALLY INERT THAT THERE THERE ARE SOME EFFECTS NOW ARE THOSE EFFECTS GOOD BAD OR NEUTRAL I THINK HAS YET TO BE F ULLY ELUST STATED NOW THE THE I FOCASSED MORE ON THE BLOOD GLUCOS RESPONSIS IN MY ANALYSIS SO IN THAT TEN WEEK STUDY THEY LOOKED AT A THEY DIDN'T WORL GLUCOS TOLERANTES TESS AND THERE CONCLUSION I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE FIT THEIR DATA TO THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT AND I AGAIN I THINK IT WAS SUCUALOS THAT IT ELEVATED A BLOOD LUCOS IN THIS IS WHERE STATISTICS CAN GET CUT A TRICKY SO MI TAKE HOME WAS THE ARIA UNDER THE CURVE THE INCREMENTAL AREA UNDER THE CURVE WHICH IS LOOKING AT THE BASICALLY THE ENTIRE GLUCOS RESPONSE WAS NOT DIFFERENT BETWEN THE CONTROL AND THE SUCUELOS CROUP TO ME THAT'S THE BIGGEST TAKE HOME THERE WAS ONE TIME POINT AT THE EIND OF THE STUDY IN THE SUCULOS CROUP THE THIRTY MENUTE TIME POINT THAT WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BLOOD LUCOS THAND THE CONTROL GROUP IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IGO CAM WAS AT ONE TIME POINT IT'S THISTISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT EVEN THEN WE'VE SEEN THINGS BE STATISTIALLY SIGNIFICANT THAT IN AT BEING DATE ARTOFACTCAS ARE NOT REPRODUCED SO NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BUT AGAIN THE OVERALL ARY UNDER THE CURVE WAS NOT DIFFERENT SO TO ME THAT WAS THE BIGGEST TAKE HOME AND PAPERS THAT WE SHOULD A PRAMENTION ARE PUBLISHED BECAUSE OF EFFACTS GENERALLY NOT LACK OF EFFECT HARDERED UPON O HYPOTHESIS DOES IT IT IT'S ACTULY REALLY UNFORTUNATE BECAUS A NOL HYPOTHESIS IS JUST AS USEFUL DATA AS THE THE NONINAL HYPOTHESIS BUT YOURE RIGHT THERE IS A VERY STRONG PUBLICATION BY US TOWARDS A SHOWING IN AFFACT I VERST IS NOT  UNLESS YOU CAN FLIP A FIELD ON ITS HEAD ENTIRELY BY SHOWING SOMETHING DID NOT HAPPEN AM TYPICALLY THE POSIIVE RESULT OUT DOES THE NEGATIVE RESULT IN POSIVE MEING YOU SEE A RESULT AM AND THEN OF COURSE IT'S ONE STUDY AND YOU KNOW YES AND I THINK THAT AS YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE CENTR OF MASS OF DATA IN A GIVEN FELD ARE PROBABLY THE BEST BASIS FOR WHAT WE SHOULD DO RIT IN TERMS OF AND SO I'M NOT CHANGING MY BEHAVIOR AROUND THE INTAKE OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS I PERSONALLY STILL GOING TO CONSUME STEVIA AND ASPERTAIN IN RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNTS I BUT AM NOW I'M THINKING WIL CAVE SOMETHING CONTAIN SUCELOS I DON'T HAVE TO PERHAPS ACTIVELY AVOID IT WHEREAS BEFORE I WAS I WAS ACTIVELY AVOIDING IT SO THE THE THE NEW STUDY I THOUGHT WAS VERY ELEGANTLY TOES IT VERY INVOLVED I MEAN BE QUITE FRANK SOME OF THE ANIMAL STUFF THEY DID WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE SO THERE WAS EXTRIC TWO ARMS THE STUDY ONE WAS A HUMAN ARM AL WAS THE ANIMORM I I FOCESS MUCH MORE ON THE HUMAN SIDE OF IT AM SO BASICALLY THIS WAS A TWO WEEK STUDY AND THE REALLY UNIQUE ASPECT OF THIS WHICH I THINK IS BOTH THE STRENGTH AND A WEAKNESS THEY HAD ALMOST FOURTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE A APPLY FOR THIS STUDY AND T EY ONLY HAD A HUNDRED AND TWENTY I THINK THAT ACTUALLY WENT INTO IT BECAUSE THEY DID A VERY DETAILED FOOD ANALYSIS OF THESE FOLKS ALL THESE PEOPLE SAID THAT THEY AVOIDED ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS WHERE DIDN'T CONSUME THEM AND I THINK PEOPLE REALIZE HOW YOU BIQUITOUS SWEETENERS ARE PRIOR TO THE STUDY THESE PEOPLE WERE LIKE IT WAS LIKE JURY SELECTION THEY'D NEVER YES SI NOT EVER HEARING OF THAT THE PLAINTIVE IN THE DEFENDIN THESE IGHT S ARE THESE MUTENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER HAD AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER RIGHT SO THE STRENGTH IS NOW YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF LIKE PRE EXISTING YOU KNOW EFFECTS THAT MAY BE CLOUDING WHAT WOULD ACTALLY HAPPEN WHEN YOU ADD TIN LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE WERE ALREADY CONSUMING ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS AND THEN YOU HAVE EM CONSUME ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THE LIKELIHOOD THINGS ARE GONG TO CHANGE IS PRETTY LOW RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A STRENGTH IT'S ALSO A WEATNESS AND ON BE REALLY CAREFUL BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE TOOK MY WORDS O LITT  TOO FAR WHICH MEANS I PROBABLY DIN DO A GOOD JOB OF BEING NEW LOST ENOUGH THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR A PLOCIBO EFFECT URE SO TO ME IF SOMEBODY HAS GONE THROUGH THAT MUCH PAINSTAKING CARE TO AVOID ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS IT'S LIKELY THEY HAVE A PRECONCEIVED NOTION THAT THOSE WARE BAD FOR YOU  TO BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO AVOID A YES IT'S POSSIBLE FOR EADING VERY MINABLY PROCESS DIHT THAT THEYR JUST NOT EXPOSED TO THE THEN THAT'S VERY TRUETHS WELL AH BUT THE OTHER THING THAT THE RESEARCHERS ACKNOWLEDGED WAS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO BLIND THE STUDY BECAUSE IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETER BEFORE YOUR ONLY USETICE LIK REGULAR SUGAR AND YOU HAVE AN ARIFICIAL SWEETENER YOU KNOW YOU TASTE YOU KNOW I IT'S STILL SWEET BUT AS OUT THE SAME SWEET AND THERE'S AN INTERESTING EFFECT THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE TASTE OF ASPERTAIN THE FIRST TIME THI CHAN QUIT DRINKING DIED SOTA FOR A WHILE THINKING I SHOULD AND THEN HAD ONE IT TASTED REALLY I CAN ONLY DESCRIBED AS KIND OF ARTIFICIAL CAMMIE AND THEN PRETTY SOON TASTED GREAT AGAIN AND SO THERE IS SOME ATTENUATION THERE AND WHETHER NOT THATS CENTRAL MEANING WITHIN THE BRAIN OR PRIFERO I DON'T KNOW BUT VERY INTERESTING WHY I SEE YOU AS A PLAYING A CRITICAL ROLE IN DEFINING WHAT IS IN WHAT IS IN WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DETERMINE AM IN TERMS OF THIS LANDSCAPE AN AND THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE REALLY OF NUTRITION WHEN IN THAT STUDY DID CHANGE MY OPINION IN TERMS OF OCA I I THINK WE CAN CLEARLY SAY NOW THE LIKE THESE ARE THESE AREN'T NEUTRAL URSTRIGHT THAT THEY'RE NOT IN ERT RIGHT  THAT THAT WAS THE THUGHT PROCESS BEFORE WAS WELLTHEY'RE NOT DIGESTED OR R WHANT NOT SO THAT THEY MUST BE AN ERT THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE THE CASE AM BUT AGAIN LIK WE LOOK AT THE THE BLOD LUCO STATE A THERE'S AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED I WON TO BE VERY CLEAR NOT SAYING THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED I'M SAYING IT'S POSSIBLE THIS HAPPENED AND SO THIS IS WHY WE NEED MORE STUDIES TO VERIFY IF THESE PEOPLE HAD A PRECONCEIVED NOTION THAT ARTIFIC SWEETENERS WERE BAD FOR THEM IT'S POSSIBLE KNOWING THEIR INJESTING ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THE THEY COULD HAVE HAD A A BLOOD LUCOS RESPOTS NOW THEN MY PUSH BACK ON MY OWN POINT THERE WOULD BE THEN WE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE IT IN ALL THE AR AND ALL THE NONATURES OF SWEETNERS WHICH THEY DIDN'T IT WAS JUST IN SUCOLOS AND SACRON IT WAS KIND OF A GRAINDI EFFACT WHERE SAGROIS AN SACRON SHOWED THE MOST DRAMATIC CHANGE YET A AND STEVIA AND A FEW OF THE OTHERS DID NOT AND THE O THE OTHER ISSUE I TOOK WITH IT MAYBE ITS A TICKY TACK THING WAS THEY'RE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS A BLOOD GLUCOS O THE OR GLUCOS TOLERATE'S TEST BUT THEY HAD PEOPLE AD MINISTER THEIR OWN OR GLUCOS TOLERATESTST WHICH BASELY THEY GAVE EM THEY SAID OKEY DRINK TO DRINK AND THEYWRE WEREN'T CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MADERS WHICH SHOULDNV BEEN FIND AM BUT AGAIN TO ME AND M ON BEING TICKY TAKY AND AGAIN I KNOW ALL STUDIES ARE LIMITED BY FUNDING SO I THINK OVER ALL THIS WAS A GREAT STUDY BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEEN THEM A YOU KNOW MONITER THE THE A OR GLUCO'S TOLERATE'S TEST AT  DOD MIISTER AN WERE AFTER AW YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY DIDN'T INJEST THIS SERT ID IN YIA YETHOSE THOSE TWO THINGS BUT THE OTHER ONE OF THE CAVIOT IS IT WAS A TWO WEEK STUDY RIGHT'S WE GOT BE REALLY CAREFUL HOW MUCH WE INTERPRETED THIS BECAUSE IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE HA THIS IS A TRANCING EFFECT RIGHT AND MAYBE IT GOES AWAY OVER TIME WE DON'T KNOW BUT AGAIN I THINK IT'S WE CAN CLEARLY SAY IT'S NOT INERT RIGHT NOW HOW MUCH EMPHASIS WE PUT ON THAT ON A TWO WEEK STUDY I'M I STILL WILL SAY O KE MAYBE IF YOURE WORRIED DON'T CONSUME SURCLOS RIGHT BUT IF YOURE YOU KNOW  HUNDRED POUNDS OVER WEIGHT AND YOU WANTED USE SOME SUCILOS AS A REPLACEMENT TO HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT I WOULD SAY DON'T LET THIS STUDY DETUR YOU FROM DOING THAT BECAUSE THE NET EFFECT TO STI TO BE MORE POSITIVE THEND YOU NOT LOSING THE WEIGHT RIGHT SO F IT'S TOOL AT HELPS YOU FINE BUT I DO HOLD OPEN THE IDEA THAT WELL THERE COULD BE NEGATIVE EFFECTS FROM IT AS WELL BUT AGAIN WE'RE WERE LOOKING IT LIKE WHAT'S THE WHAT IS THE OVER ALL OUTCOME RIGHT AND THEN WHEN I LOOKED AT AM THEY EXAMINED LIKE SOME OF THE A DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WERE INCREASED WITH THESE DIFFERENT A SWEETNERS AND AGAIN THIS WORK IT'S MESSY BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS THEY SAW WAS A BIG INCREASE IN BUTERATE PRODUCTION FROM THE CHANGE IN THEY GOT MACROBYUM PORSUALY WELL AS WE DISCUSSED EARLY BUTERATES ASIER ASSOCIATED WITH LIKE POSITIVE OUTCOMES IND TURMS OF INSOLENT SENSITIVITY AN FLAMMATION AND SOME OTHER THINGS SO I JUST I WONTO BE REAL CAUTIOUS BEFORE PEOPLE SAY WHELE THERE'S A CHANGE THE MACROBIUMIT MUST BE A BAD CHANGE WE DON'T KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE AND AGAIN IF WE HAVE YOU KNONT TEN MORE STUDIES COME OUT AND START TO SHOW THIS THAN I WILL START TO SHIFT MY PERSONAL OPINION OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS SO IN ANTICIPATION OF SITTING DOWN TODAY I DID SOLICIT A FOR QUESTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT GOT A LOT OF UPVOTES I LIKES IF IF YOU WILL WAS IT ONE THAT I THINK RAISES INTERESTING QUESTIONS ABOUT SHORT TURMAN LONG TURN HEALTH AND IT'S THE FOLLOWING ITHINK IT'S A COMMENCENARIO A NUMBER O PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS THE HEALTHIEST WAY TO APPROACH A KIND OF RAPID WEIGHT LOSS AND HEAR WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING IS SOMEBODY HAS AN EVENT COMING UP OR THEY'RE JUST TIRED OF BEING THE WEIGHT THEY ARE CARRYING THE AMOUNT OF AUTOPOST ISSUE THEY ARE AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SAFE TO FOR INSTANCE LOSE THREE POUNDS A WEEK FOR A FEW WEEKS IN ANTICIPATION OF A WEDDING OR SOME OTHER EVENT AND WHETHER OR NOT STRAIGHT CLERIC RESTRICTION AND INCREASING ACTIVITY A IS THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH THAT A WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY MAY GAIN BACK A LITTLE AFTERWARDS THEY MIGHT MAKE THINK IDEALLY THEY'D LIKE TO MAINTAIN IT AFTERWARDS BUT WHAT D YOU THINK OF THAT SORT OF APPROACH AYOU KNOW CUTTING CLERK IN TAKIN HALF FOR INSTANCE AND THEN DOUBLING AND ALSO DOUBLING YOUR PHYSICAL OUTPUT SO IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED BY WHONE ON TO SAY WHICH IS THE RESEARCHAD ACTU TENDS TO SUGGEST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE O BEES WHO LOSE A LOT MORE WEIGHT EARLY ARE MORE LIKELY TO KEEP IT OFF WHICH SEEMS THE LITTLE BUT CONO CONTRADICTORY RIGHT LIKE WELL THAT DOESN'T SEEM VERY SUSTAINABLE BUT AGAIN YOUR YOUR WEIGHING COMPETING THINGS SO THERE SUSTAIN A BUILIDY ASPECT WITH THEN IS ALSO LIKE BUY IN IS HUGE FOR SUSTAINABILITY RIGHT SO FOR A LOT OF OERIT OR BEAST PEOPLE IF THEY START A DIT THEY DON'T SEE SOMETHING QUICKLY THEY CUNT AF BAIL ON IT BECAUSE IT IT'S NOT WORKING WHEREAS THAT THEY SEE SOME RAPID RESULTS PRETTY QUICKLY THEY BUY AN EVEN HARDER RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY FOR IF THERE'S ANY COACHES OR TRAINERS OUT THERE IS JUST PRESENTING THAT AS THE DNOFOR MY FEVRITE LINES AS THERE ARE NO SOLUTIONS OR SONLY TRADE OFFS I THINK THOMAS SOUL SO THAT SO YOU'RE YOUR HAVING A TRADE OFF HERE IM IT IS YES YOU'RE RITTL LOSE FAT FASTER YOU MIGHT LOSE LEAN MASSLE BUT FASTER TOO WHICH CAN BE A PROBLEM BUT I WILL SAY THE MORE AT A POST TISSUE YOU HAVE THE MORE AGGRESSIVELY YOU CAN DIET WITHOUT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES SOMEBODY LIKE ME DOING A RELAGRESSIVE DIET IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD FOM MY LEAN MASS ONE I'VE A HIGHELYN MASS THE NORMAL TO I'VE A LOWER BODY FAT THE NORMAL AS YOURE BODY FAT GOES DOWN THE PERCENTAGE OF WEIGHT LOSS FROM LEAN MASS GOES UP SO I'M PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY OBEES BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH OUT OPOST TISSUE TO PULL FROM THERE'S VERY LITTLE REASON FOR THE BODY TO CATABOLIZE LEAN TISSUE NOW THAT BEING SAID IF YOU GO ON A PEOPLE MISINTERPRET LIKE THEY LIKE WEL LIKE A IN BODYED ON AND WERE A DECKS A DONE AND I'VE LOST YOU KNOW TWO POUNDS OF LEAN MASS AND THEY'VE EKNOW THEY'VE LOST TWENTY POUNDS OVER ALL WO CUE MINE OUT OPOST TISSUE ITSELF IS THRTEEN PER CENT LEAN MASS SO THERE'S ACTUALLY LIKE U NO PROATEEN COMPONET TO LIKE THE STRUCTURAL COMPONE OF THE OUTIPOST TISSUE AND IT DOES HAVE SOME WATER SO IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT LIPID BUT THE OTHER PART IS LEAN SO AT MIN OF EM YOU SHOULD EXPECT A THIRTEEN PER CENT PRODUCTION AND LEAN MASS WHEN YOU DIET AND THEN WHEN YOU CONSIDER LIKE YOU LOSE BODY WATER OVER ALL WHICH IS REGISTERS IS LEAN MASS I'M AND YOU LOSE A YOUR SPLAINTIC TISSUES CAN SHRINK A LITTLE BIT SO IT'S NORMAL TO LOSE YOU KNOW FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON TO LOSE LIKE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY PER CENT OF THE WEIGHT THAT THEY LOSE FROM LEAN MASS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SKELLIDLE MUSSEL TISSUE AND AGAIN THAT THE MORE OUTOPOST YOU HAVE THE MORE AGRESSIVELY YOU CAN APPROACH THE DIET WITHOUT REALLY NEGATIVE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES TO LEAN MASSER OVER ALL HEALTH BUT BALANCE THAT WITH O CAY IF IM WHEN TO DO THIS I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE DIETING THIS WAY FOREVER I'M DOING THIS TO GIVE MYSELF A BOOSE O THE BEGINNING AND I HAVE TO BE OCE AT SOME POINT WITH TRANSISIONIN TO SOMETHING THE SYLLABLE MORE SUSTAINABLE BAY SOMEWHAT YOU JUST SAID IT MINDS ME OF THE A SATIETY SIGNAL EFFECT OF EXERCISE YOU MENTION EARLIER THAT EXERCISING CAN IMPROVE A OUR SENSE OF WHEN WE'VE HAD ENOUGH TO EAT I JUST WANT IT BRIEFLY MENTION THAT WHEN ALLY CRUM WAS ON THE POTCAS SHE MENTION THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING A STUDY THAT I I I HAVE TO PAIR YOU TO AND HAVE I HEAR THE CONVERSATION AS A FLY ON THE WALL BECAUSE WHEN SHE WAS TELLING ME WAS THAT IF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT OF FOOD IS NUTRICIOUS FOR THEM THEN EATING LESS OF IT A REGISTER SAYS MORE SATIATING WHEREAS IF PEOPLE VIEW DIETING AS A DEPROVATION SYSTEM OLO LIKE OH YOU KNOW DETING AS HARD IN THE FOOD SOKS AND IT'S TERRIBLE WELL THEN THEY CRAVE ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS WHEREAS THEY CAN THEY ACTUALLY OBSERVE IN THEIR STUDIES WHERE PEOPLE REPORT REDUCED CRAVING IF THEY ARE TOLD FOR INCANCE A CHICKEN BREAST AND ROCKLEY AND SOME ALL OF OIL AND RICE IS ACTUALLY QUITE NOURISHING IT'STHAT YOU REALLY GOOD FOR YOU THEN PEOPLE EAT THAT AND THEY FEEL THAY TEE ACTUALLY EATEN MORE THIS ATIDY SIGNALLING GOES OUT SO IT'S JUST NOT JUST A POINT THAT ALLY MAD O TOS AREN'T MI TE DIETY IS SO IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE EVEN THE RATE AT WHICH YOU EAT AND RIHT DOWN TO THE SIZE OF THE PLATE AND THE COLOR OF THE PLATE LIKE THE CONTRAST AN COLOR REALLY THEY THEY SEE I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTY I THINK IT'S IF THE PLATE IS A SIMILAR COLOR TO THE FOOD I I THINK PEOPLE EAT MORE WHEREAS IF IT'S A BIGGER CONTRAST THEY EAT LESS SO EVEN LIKE PLATE COLOR CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON HOW MUCH EAT SO AGAIN HUMAN BRAIN VERY AMAZING BUT ALSO VERY DUMB IN SOME WAYS RIGHT I T AN OPTIMIZED ALGAR ITHE I ALWAYS IALWAYS JOKE WOF PEOPLE LIKE JUST LOOK T HOW STUPID HUMANS ARE YOU PUT SOME WATER IN FRONT OF THE LIKE YOU THOUGH THE OCEAN THE LIKE O I'LL PAY TEN TIMES MORE FOR THIS ET LI BUT IT'S JIS WER KIND OF IRE THAT WAY THE UM THE REWARD SIGNALING PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN RUN ONE CHEMICAL MAINLY DOPEMIN THER ARE OTHERS OF COURSE BUT AND VERY FEW ALGARITHMS ITS SORT OF LIKE A INTERMITTENT REENFORCEMENT IS ON RANDOM REINFORCE BUT IN THE END THAT THERE AREN'T MANY ALGARITHMS AND WE WE ARE PROBABLY NOT OPTIM I CERTAINLY NOT OTIMIZED FOR OUR OWN HEALTH BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL EAT THEMSELVES TO DEATH DRUG THEMSELVES TO DEATH ET CETERA SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMETHING FELT A GOOD AT ONE POINT WHE IT'S IT PROVES YOUR POINT ONE THINGS I TELL PEOPLE I I SAID THE SONO AND IF FOR SOLA'S PODCAST WAS INTERESTINGLY THE DICONOMY OF LIFE IS IF YOU DO WHAT'S EASY IN THE SHORT TERM YOUR LIFE WILL BE HARD IF YOU DO WHAT'S HARD IN THE SHORT TERM YOUR LIFE WILL GET EASIER IT'S VERY STRANGE AND ACTUALLY ETEN SUPLYT HAD A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS WHEN HE WAS OVER FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS HE SAID THE AMOUNT OF WORK I HAD TO DO TO CONSTRUCT MY LIFE THAT I COULD JUST LIVE WAS SO MUCH MORE WORK THEN JUST GOING TO THE GIM FOR A COUPLE HOURS A DAY HE'S LIKE THE GIM WORK IS HARD HE'S LIKE I LOOK BACK HOW MUCH WORK I HAD TO DO TO SUSTAIN THAT LIFE SOL FIRST IS JUST GOING TO THE GIM AND LIKE BE TO RESTRICTING CALORIES HE'S LIKE TO MAINTAIN THE LIFE STYL OF BEING FIVE HUNDER PALENCE WAS INFINITELY MORE DIFFICULT THAN WHAT I DO NOW AND SO IGE GEN GREAT EXAMPLE SHORT TERM HARD GOING TO THE GIM CALLORY RESTRICTION LONG TERM LIFE'SEASIER JUST REALLY INTERESTING DICONOMY I THINK ABOUT LIN AND I CAN'T BE RESTATED OFTEN ENOUGH SEED OILS PEOPLE WANT TO ASK CON SEED OLS AND FOR AT AND F AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE LISTENING WHO ARE WONDERING WYWARE WERDS FOR A CHUCKLING ALREADY I SHAL MENTION THAT BOTH IN THE TWITTER SPHERE AND IN SERAM AND ON LINE THAT THERE'S THERE THESE VERY POLARIZED VIEWS THAT PROBABLY AREN'T WORTH FOCASSING ON FOR TOO LONG BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF A FOLKS OUT THERE WERE ARGUING THAT SEED OILS ARE THE SOURCE OF ALL HOUR THE'BESITY EPIDAMIC A E INFLAMMATION ET CETERA LUMINIM EVERYTHING AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE THAT WOULD ARGUE JUST THE OPPOSITE UM THAT YOU KNOW MEAT IS THE SOURCE OF ALL PROBLEMS ET CETERA AND I THINK WE'VE THANKS TO YOUR NEW AUNTS AND AND EXPERT EASY WE A HOEFULLY APPROPRIATELY FRAME THINGS THAT IT'S NEVER THAT BLACK AND WHITE IT'S SIMPLY NOT UM ORDEALLY RARELY UM I LOVE OLIVE OIL I NO I REALIZE THAT DOESN'T FIT EXACTLY INTO THE SEED OIL CATEGORY UM I LOVE ALOF OIL I USE IT IN MODERATION I DO ALSO CONSUME SOME BUTTER IN MODERATION IM ET CETERA BUT ARE THERE ANY DADA ON SEED OILS AND HERE I GOOD EXAMPLE I THINK WOULD BE LIKE CONOLA OIL WHICH COMES FROM THE RAPE SEED THAT LITERALLY WAS RENAMED CONOL OIL BECAUSE RAPE SEED OIL IS NOT GOOD MARKETING LENO NOW EXACTLY AM SO THE FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS SEADOLLS HAVE HAVE NEGATIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO OUR OVERA HEALTH BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE LAST ME NO TWENTY THIRTY YEARS WHAT THEY HAVE TEND TO ADDED TO ADD INTO THEIR DIET THAT HAS INCREASED THE OVERALL CALORY LOAD IS OIL A LIKE THESE VARIOUS A UNMOSTLY FRUMSEET OILS BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT LIKE ONE TO ONE REPLACEMENT WITH OTHER FATS AND SO I IF YOU LOOK AT THE EPODEMEOLOGY YET YOU CAN FIND SANEPEDYMEOLOGY SHOWING PEOPLE WHO CONSUME MORE SEATOL HAVE MORE NEGATIVE HEALTHOUT COMES PROBLEM IS AGAIN TIED UP WITH MULTITUDE OF OTHER BEHAVIORS AND THEN YOU CAN FIND MECHANISMS AND THE THE IDEA IS WELL THESE HAVE THERE POLLY ON SATURATED WHICH MEANS IN THE FATYACID CHAIN THERE'S MULTIPLE DOUBLE BONDS WHICH THOSE DOUBLE BONDS CAN BE OXIDIZED A WHEN THE'RE EXPOSED TO HEAT AND SOME OTHER THINGS AND SO THE IDEA S WELL WHEN YOU COOK WITH THESE THINGS AND YOU KNOW THEY GET DI THEY GET A OX THEY MAKE AT OXIDIZED AND ASCON ACAUSE INFLAMMATION YOUR BODY SO THAT'S A A PLAUSIBLE MECHANISM SO AS ALWAYS I DEFER TO THE HUMAN RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS AND SO WHAT YOU TEND TO FIND IS WHEN YOU SUBSTITUTE POLLYON SATURATED FATS ER SO WHEN YOU SUBSTUTE SATURATED FATS FOR POLLYON SATRATED FATS IT'S EITHEIR NEUTRAL OR POSITIVE AND TERMS OF THE EFFECTS ON LIKE A INFLAMMATION IS BASICALLY NEUTRAL THERE THERE'S SOME STUDIES THAT SHOW A POSITIVE EFFACT OF DOING A POLLYON SATURATED FATS BUT IT PROBABLY DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL POLYON SATURATED FAT ANDTHAT'S H NO THING I I DON'T BELIEVE IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOUR YOU'RE CATEGRIZING LIKE EVERYTHING IN THIS ONE BUCKET AND THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL FATYACIDS EVEN WITH SATURATED FAT LIKE A FOR EXAMPLE A STERIC ACID DOESN'T TEND TO RAISE ELDIOL COLLESTERALL WHEREAS SEENO SATURATED FAT AS A WHOLE TENDS TO RAISE TH ELDIAL CLLUSTERALL BUT THERE'RE SOME SATURATED FATS THAT DON'T SO AGAIN IT'S IT'S LIKE WERE PUTTING THINGS IN BUCKETS AND ITS SIVILE MORE NEW OTS THAN THAT THEN IF YOU LOOK AT A LIKE THE EFFECTS OF A NO PLLYON SATURATED FATS ON MARKERS OF CORLY OF ASCULAR DISEASE AGAIN TENDS TO EITHER BE A NEUTRAL OR POSITIVE OFFACT WHEN YOU SUBSTITUTE ASATURATED FAT FOR PLYON SATURATED FAT NOW IF YOU WANT TO GET ITS LIKE MONOON SATURATED FOR POLLYON SATURATED THERE'S SOME THERE'S QUITE A BIT DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE STUDIES WHAT I WOULD SAY BASE ON THE HUMAN RANMIZE CONTROL TRIALS IS THAT YOUR PROBABLY BETTER OFF CONSUMING MONOON SATURATED N POLYON SATURATED IN PLACE OF SATURATED FAT BUT AGAIN IF THE IDEA IS WELL THAT MEANS POLLY'S UN SATURATE ARE GOOD FOR ME SO I'M JUST GOING TO DOUPLE BUNCH OIL ON EVERYTHING AND NOW YOU'RE UP IN YOUR CAL RAYS WELL TAT'S THAT THAT'S A NEGATIVE NOW RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO WIT THE BIGGER PROBLEM OF OVER ALL ENERGY TAXICITY SO I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO LIKES TO DEMONIZE INDIVIDUAL NEUTRIANCE I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN REALLY COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT SEEDOILS ARE THE ROUTE CAUSE OF THE PROMS ATARE BEING SUGGESTED AND I THINK THIS'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF KIND OF LIKE WHENEVER THERE'S A SOMETHING THOT POPS UP IN THE FITEST INDUSTRY THERE'S ALWAYS LIKE THE OPPOSITE THING THAT POPS UP AND IS LIKE THE REACTIONARY YOU KNOW EXTREME REACTION TO WHATEVER THIS THING WAS OVER HERE AN I THENK THITS OVER SEEING WITH SOME OF THE THE SEEDOIL STOFF IS ITS IT'S MOSTLY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO CON DISPOSE THE VIRTUES OF SATURATED FAT AND LISTEN I THINK IT'S FINE TO CONSUME SUME SATURATED FAT BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW I THINK LIMITING IT TO YOU KNOW SEVEN TO TEN PER CENT OF YOUR DAILY CALORY AND TAKE US PROBABLY WISE AGAIN BASE ON THEM THE ALL THE CONSENSIS OF THE EVIDENCE I'VE SEEM AND SO ONCE AGAIN LIKE WWERE STRUGGLING WITH THIS CAN WE'VE GOT THE SEPETYMEOLOGY IN THSE MECHANISMS THAT SOUND GOOD BUT THEN WHAT ACTY HAPPENS WHEN WE WE DO SOME HUMAN RANDOMIZE CONTROL TRIALS AND AND SO FAR I JUST HAVE IT SEEM THE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SEEDOILS ARE INDEPENDENTLY BAD FOR YOU INDEPENDENT THE CALLORIES THEY CONTAIN YOU SAID THE WORDS OVER ALL ENERGY TOICITY AND I JUST ON A HIGHLIGHT THAT I THINK THATS A FABULOUS TERM I DON'T UT I DON'T THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE PRIMED OR WE ARE ALL PRIME TO THINK OF CASE SEEDOILS MIGHT BE BAD OR ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS MIGHT BE BAD OR THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT OF BLOOD WORK MIGHT REPRESENT SOMETHING GOOD OR BAD WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OVER ALL ENERGY TOXICITY OF THE TOXICITY OF OVER CONSUMING CALLORIES ENERGY AND A THANK YOU FOR A POINTING OUT THAT MOST OF THE DATE A POINT TO THE FACT THAT SATURATED FAT SHOULD MAKE UP ABOUT NO MORE THAN SEVEN O TEN PER CENT OF TOTAL DAILY CLORI CAN TAKE IS THERE A LOWER AN THRESHOLD THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC A FOR INSTANCE I'VE NOTICED THAT MY BLOOD PROFILES ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF FORMONES IMPROVE WHEN I'M GETTING SUFFICIENT SATURATED FAT MAYBE I'M A MUTIN BUT YEARS AGO BECAUSE I'M A PRODUCT OF GROWING UP IN THE NINEYEAS I TRY TO LOW FAT DIED I ITS CERTAINLY CRUSHED MY ANDRGEN LEVELS I START ADDING SOME BUTTER BACK IN AND I WAS RIGHT BACK IN THE IN THE IN THE SWEET ZONE I WHERE I WANTED TO BE SO I U A SEVEN OR TEN PER CENT OF TOLLY A DAILY CLOR CAN TAKE AS I'M GUESSING IS PROBABLY ABOUT WHAT I DO NOW I'LL HAVE TO CHECK BUT IS THERE DANGER TO GOING TOO LOW IN SATRATED FATS SO AGAIN NO SLUTIONS ONLY TRADE OFF'S RIGHT WHAT MAXIMISE IS OUT TESTOSTRONE MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST THING FOR LONGGEVITY RIGHT IN ADVICE AVERSA I'M NOT I'M NOT MAKING THAT CLAIM SPECIFICALLY BY THEN ETSIMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THIS THAT I THINK WE ALL HAVE THIS IDEA THAT THIS IS ONE I CONIC DIET OUT THERE THAT IS GOING TO BE THE BEST IET FOR BUILDING MUSCLE AND BURNING FAT AND A PREVENTING CANCER AN HEART DISEASAN AND THE REALITY IS LIKE THERE'S OVER ALL HEALTHY DIETARY PATTERNS THAT WE SEE THERE ARE GOOD FOR THOSE THINGS BUT WE GET DOWN INTO THE WEEDS THERE'S PROBABLY SOME PUSHAN PULL HERE AS WELL RIGHT SO WHEN IT COMES TO SATURATED FAT AM THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT IF YOU'RE TOO LOW ON IT T YES YOU CAN HAVE A REDUCTION AND TESTOSTRONE NOW IS THAT REDUCTION IN TESTOSTROM LET'S SAY FIFTEEN TWENTY PER CENT WHATEVER IT MAY BE IS THT SUFFICIENT ACTUALY CAUSE LOSS OF LEAN MASS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S THAT'S NEVER BEEN SHOWN INTERESTINGLY A IJUST REMEMBER THIS THERE WAS ONE STUDY THAT WAS COMPARING AM POLLYON SATURATED FAT VERSIS SATURATED FAT A AND THEY EQUATED TOTAL FAT AND ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING THINGS WAS THE GROUP GEING THE PLAAN SATURATED FAT HAD MORE LEAN MASS AT THE END OF THE STUDY COMPARED TO THE GROUP GETTING SATURATED FAT NOW'S ONLY ONE STUDY I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS REPLICATED SO I I'M VERY THIS IS THE SITUATIONAR I I SAY I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE MECHANISM OF THAT IS BECAUSE THIS COULD JUST BE RANDOM AM BUT IF THAT GETS SHOWN OVER AND OVER WHAT I MIGHT SAY IS O K WELL WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE WE IF POLLYON SATURATEDS ARE SOMEHOW INCREASING LEAN MASS COMPARED TO SATURATED FAT WHO CARES WHAT IPENS WITH TESTOSTRONE I'M LESS THAT REDUCTION TESTOSTRO IS CAUSING SOME KIND OF IMPUDENT E IMPOTENCE FOR YOUR LIFE RIGHT AM SO ALL THAT'S SAY I DON'T REALLY KNOW AND A BY THE WAY THAT SOMETHING A FOR THOSE WATCHING AND LISTENING A REAL EXPERTS EVERY ONCE SO ALL YOU SHOUD HEAR THEM SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS I DON'T KNOW I ATYOUR ADVISER WAS EXCEPTIONAL THAT ANUS AND SHE WAS BRILLIANT I A AND THEN IN TERMS OF LIKE A COLUSTRAL SYNTHESIS YOU REALLY NEED A VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF STURATED FAT FOR ELDOL CLOSTRALL SAID THE SISSUR YOUR LIVER CAN SYNTHESIZE LIKE THE AMOUNT AF ELDAL COLUSTER ALL OR COLLUSTERAL THAT YOUR BODY REQUIRES IS SO SMALL IN TERMS OF LIKE JUST LIVING AND BEING HEALTHY SO I DON'T THINK YOU AT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT AND FROM A CARD OF ASTUA TOS EASE STANDPOINT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT EVEN TAKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIKE CUOTONCO LOCOL LO ELDIOL OF LIKE NO EIGHTY OR NINETY AND TAKING THEM DOWN TO LIKE THIRTY OR FORTY THAT THERE IS STILL A A A BENEFIT FOR THE RISK OF CROT  VASCER DISEASE SO AGAIN YOU'R YOUR WAGING NEES THESE TWO BUCKETS RIGHT SO THAT I SAY YOU NO FOR DO IN SEVENTYTEN PER CENT FROM FROM SATURATED FAT YOU'RE PROBABLY FIN RECEIVED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE FEMALE SPECIFIC DIE AN EXERCISE PROTOCALLS AND IREALIZES IS A VAST LANDSCAPE BUT I'M SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS RELATED TO MANOPAUS AND PREMEN APAUSIT AND SOME RELATED TO THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE MOST RELATED TO VARIATIONS ACROSS THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IN TERMS OF AM LET'S YOU SAY DIET A MAINTENANCE OR SUBCHLORIC DIET UM ARE THERE ANY HINS THAT YOU'VE OBSERVED AND WE'LL TALK A ABIT LATER ABOUT AM THE THIS WONDERFUL AP THAT YOU'VE PRODUCEHIS CAUGHT CARBON AP WHICH HELPS PEOPLE A MANAGE THEIR ENERGY AND TAKE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS A MENSE O THERE YOU HAVE A SORT OF DAT A BACE OR AT LEAST UNEXPERIENCE PACE AND THEN I'M GUESSING THER PROBABLY ALSO STUDIES EXPLORING MALE VERSES FEMALE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF ADHERENCE IN WHAT SORTS OF DIETS WORK AS IT ARE THERE ANY GENERAL THEMES THAT ONE CAN EXTRAT FROM THAT THIS CAN BE REALLY UNPOPULAR SIGMENT FOR THE WOMEN AM DOESN'T EM TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE SO TALY THEY MAY BE RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT AUS IT  MAKE SORTING THROUGH THE INFORMATION SPACE AND CERTAINLY THE INFORMATION WE'VE COVERED IN THIS POTGAS UP TIL NOW SIMPLER IT MEANS THAT EVERYTHING ISN'T DIFFERENT FOR THEM N SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE MALE VERSES FEMALE STUDIES RELATION TO DIET THEY SEEM TO RESPOND TO SOME SIMILAR WAY LIKE A SOMEAR COLERD CALRY DEFICIT SEEMS TO PRODUCE SIMILAR RESULTS AM IF YOU DO LOW CAR HIGH CAR REGARDLESS IT SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES NOW TRAINING WISE WE DO KNOW THAT FEMALE LIKE THE MUSCLE FIBRS ADAPT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY TO TRAINING BUT IT WITHOUT GETTING TOO FAR TO THE WEEDS IT DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE THE WAY YOU SHOULD TRAIN AM BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART BUILDING MUSCLE THERE'S A LOT OF DFFERENT WAYST TO BUILD MUSCLE SO WE KNOW THAT LIKE LIGHT LOADS UP TO MAY BE LIKE THIRTY RAPS AS LONG AS IT'S TAKEN CLOSE TO FAILURE HAVE BASICALLY THE SAME EFFECT ON BUILDING MUSCLE LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM AS HEAVY LOADS FOR LOW RAPS IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT TAKING THE MUSCLE CLOSE TO FATIGUE OR FAILURE YOU'LL HAVE TO GO OU'D HOVE TO GO TOO FAILURE BUT GETTING CLOSE WITHIN A FEW RAPS AM IF YOU'RE BETWEEN ONE RAP IN THIRTY RAPS IFYOU'REGETTING CLOSE TO FAILURE SEEM TO PRODUCE SIMILAR RESULTS A GEIIN GREAT YOU CAN PICK WITH WHICHEVER FORM OF DISCOMFORT YOU YOU PREFER RIGHT AM WHEN IT COMES TO FEMALE SPECIFIC TRAINING AGAIN FEMALES ACTUALLY THIS IS ONE THING THE LIK DON'T KNOW THEY ACTLY PUT ON A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF LEAN MASS AS A PERSENTAGE OF THEIR STARTING LEAN MASS AS MEN IN FACT THERE'S NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AND THE AMOUNT OF LEAN MASS THEY PUT ON NOW THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF LEAN MASS THAT'S ADDED WILL BE GREATER FOR MEN BECAUSE THEY STARTED WITH A GEATER AMOUNT OF LEAN MASS BUT THE RELATIVE INCREASE IN LEAN MASS IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME FROM SIMILAR TRAINING NOW AFEMALES THAT THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCESN LIKE FIBRA TYPES THAT FEMALES TEN TO BE A LIBUT LESS FATIGABLE THAN THEN MEN THEY CAN THEY CAN GO A BUT HARLIB LONGER AND THERE'S ALSO SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY RECOVERA BUT BETTER BUT THAT ALSO COULD BE SIMPLY TO TO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO USE AS HEAVY OF LOADS TO I TO INDUCE HYPERTROPHE SO I KIND TO HAVE THIS THEORY THAT WILE YOU KNOW AS A PERCENTAGYOUR WONDER AT MAXS YOU CAN PROGRAM THINGS I THINK ABSOLUTE LOAD MATTERS WHEN YOU LOOK AT LIKE THE MOST ILLETE POWER LIFTERS THE SUPERHEAVY WEIGHTS AREN'T SQUATTING THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEIRE SQUATTING EIGHT NINE HUNDRED POUNDS I THINK THAT THERE'S AN OVER ALL RECOVERY OF FACT THERE I GAN I'VE NO DATO TO BACK THIS UP THIS IS JUST MY MY OBSERVATION BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE LIGHTER WEIGHT CLASSES AND THIS GOES FOR MEN TOO YOU DO SEE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO DO YOU KNOW MANY TRAINING SESSIONS AT HIGH ARPSE AND SEEM TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM THAT SO I DO THINK THE ABSOLUTE LOAD MAKES A DIFFERENCE NOW WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE MINSTRUAL CYCLE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE I KIND IT TELL PEOPLE YOU KNOW DO WHAT YOU PREFER SO THERE'S SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU SHOULD PROGRAME YO SHOULD LIKE KIND OF SCUDGE YOUR TRAINING AROUND YOUR MINSTRUAL CYCLE WHICH IS A WHENEVER YOU'RE GOING THROUG MINSTRUAL CYCLE YOU KNOW REDUCE THE INTENSITY REDUCE THE VOLUME BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOTK ON A FEEL AS GOOD YOUD NO C TRAIN AS WELL WHAT I WOULD SAY IS JUST OUGHT TO REGULATE THAT IF YOU GO IN AND YOU'RE ON YOUR PERIOD BUT YOU YOU FEEL GOOD AND YOU'RE DOING WELL THAT DAY THAN I DON'T THINK YOU NESELLING YOU TO BACK IT OFF AND THERE THERE WAS ONE STUDY THE KIND OF SUPPORTED THAT NOTION BUT IF YOU GO AND YOU FEEL TERRIBLE AND YOU KNOW YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULD USE YOU KNOW A REDUCTION AND INTENSITY IN VOLUME THAN IT'S TOLLY FINE TO OUT O REGULATE THAT WHEN I SAY OUGHT TO REGULATION I'M OUGHTO REGULATION MEANS YOU ARE REGULATING THE INDIVIDUAL TRAINING SESSION BASE ON YOUR PERFORMANCE SO A I OUGHT TO REGULATE IN SO FAR AS I'M LIKE I'M I'M A SUPERNERTED SO I HAVE A A VELOCITY TOVICE SO I CAN ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE BAR AND SEE HOW FAST THE LOAD MOVES AND I KNOW IT VARIOUS DIFFERENT LIKE WARM UP WEIGHTS WHAT VELOCITIES I SHOULD BE HITTING SO IF I HIT MY LAST WARM UP AND MY VELOCITIES ABOUT TEN PERCENT HIGHER THAN USUAL A I CAN BE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THAT'S CAN BE GOOD DAY FOR ME IF IT'S LOWER THAT I CAN BACK AT OFF A LITTLE BIT IN FACT THAT WORLDS I HIT MY LAST DEADLIFT IT WAS THIRTY PER CENT  MY LAST MY LAST DELITH WARM UP IT WAS THIRTY PER CENT FASTER THAN I USUALLY HID IN THE GIM AN I TURN TO LOOK TOT MY COACH I SAID THE I WERE GOIN TO GET THIS TO DAY I DON'THERE'S VARIOUS FORMS OF WAST OUHT TO REGULATE BUT AGAIN WOMEN IF YOU'RE ON YOUR PERIOD BUT YOU FEEL GOOD I DON'T THIN THERES ANY REASON YOU YOU TO BACK OFF BUT IF YOU'RE OT FEELING GOOD THAN IT'S TOLLY APPROPRIATE TOBACCO RABVER SAYS COOKFOODS PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW A WHETHER NOT FOR INSTANCE EYOU KNOW YOUT AY MAY RAW APPLE OVERS I DON'OOS ANY ONE COOK APPLES I GIT'S TAT AN PEOPLE EAS TO BAKE AT EVER BAKE DAPPLES WAS E DESERTN WHEN I WAS AGAN IT WAS COUNT OF THE LET DOWN DESERT SAR NOW NELIKE NOT ASSOM UNLESS IT AT A SCUP OF ISCREE MINITE RAYVEAN TEY MAY ME NOT AWSO BUT ANYWAY ROVERS IS COOKED AM OBVIOUSLY IF YOU BURN A PIECE OF MEAT TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S PURE CHARCOAL THAT'S TOO MUCH IN IF YOU THERE IS A SMALL MOVEMENT A SURROUNDING EATING RAW MEATS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I PARTICULARLY ENJOY FRANKLY SUSHE IS THE ONLY RAW FOOD I I PERSONALLY EN JEST AN ABSEM I AM VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE SOURCE FRANKLY A REPUTABLE PLACES A IS THERE ANYTHING YOU KOW REAL ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO EXTRACT THE MENOACIDS BY DEMENS AN MINERALS FROM THE FOOD A ROBBERS'S COOKED IT JUST LOOKS COOL FOR INSTAGRAM A SO WHEN YOU COOK FOODS THE ACITON TO BECOME IN TERMS A PROATING CONTAINING FOODS THEY TEND TO BECOME MORE DIGESTIBLE NOT LESS A EGGS ARE THIS WAY MEATS TO THIS WAY A PEOPLE SO WELL YOU KNOWL WHAT YOU WHEN YOU HEAT PROTINE YOU DO NATURE IT AND I THINK THEY HEAR THAT WORD TO NATURE AND THEY THINK DESTROY AND THAT IS NOT WHAT TOU NATURE MEANS SO PROTINES FOLD UP IN TO THREE DEE DIMENTIONAL STRUCTURES YOU KNOW THIS OF COURSE A BASIN THERE OU MENOACID SEQUENTS AND THEIR SPECIFIC ENERGIES OF THOSE O MELASCIDS AM WHEN YOU HEAT PROTINE OR AD ACID IT STARTS TO UNFOLD THAT A THAT PROTING STRUCTURE THAT HAPPENS DURING DIGESTION ANYWAY SO ILWAYS CHUCKLE WHUN LIKE THE LIKE HI'VE SEEN SOME COMPANIES COME OUT WITH WAY THAT YOU CAN COOK WITH RIGHT THAT THAT'S NOCKIN TO YOU KNO DESTROY THEY MULACIDS IM LIKE SO YOU MEAN LIKE REGULAR WAY RIGHT SO A YAT COOKI TYPICALLY COOKING ACTI MAKES A MENOACIDS MORE BILE AVAILABLE NOT LESS NOW AM I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM CHARRING YOUR MEAT A BECAUSE THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT CHARRING CREATES APOLLIERMATIC HYDRO CARBONS WHICH AAT LEAST IN ANIMALS WHEN THEY GIVE THOSE A THEY APPEAR TO BE CARSONAGETIC SO IF YOU DO CHARING ME BY ACCIDENT I WOULD JUST CUT OFF THE CHARRED PORTIONS AM AND THEN YOU SHOULD BE FINE THE CHATTER IS DELICIOUS A HA HA NOT NOT OF ITS CHARGE TOO MUCH BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT A CHARRED CROSS ON O ME MY DAD'S ARGENTINE I LIKE A GOUD A ARY I A WHAT ABOUT A PEOPLE REFERRED TO THEM IN THEIR QUESTIONS AS CARBOT BLOCKERS BUT I THING WHAT THEYE REFERRING TOER THINGS LIKE BERBERINE AND SOME OF THE GLUECO SCAVENGERS AND AM ONE GLUECO SCAVANGER ID LEFT FR YOU TO COMMENT ON IS THIS ASSERTION THAT TAKING A BRISK WALK AFTER A MEAL OR MAYBE EVEN A SLOW WALK AFTER A MEAL SOME MOVEMENT CAN HELP AM DOWN SHIFT THE AMOUNT OF CIRCULATING GLUECOS IN SOME WAY I'VE HEARD THAT AM NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT SOME ARE STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS IDEA OF TAKING THINGS LIKE BERBERINE OR EVEN MAT FORMAN AM CAN SCAVANGE GLUECOAS I PERSONALLY CAN'T TAKE BERBERY IF I TAKE IT I GET MASSIVE HEADACES UNLESS I'VE INGESTED HONS OF SUGAR IN CARBOHYDRATES SIJUST DON'T MASSUROUND WITH IT BUT I I KNOW THER RE NUMBER IF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT WANT TO KNOW WHETHER NOT THESE GLUECO SAVENGERS CAN BE USEFUL I THINK THAT IS REALLY MAJORY IN THE MINERS OF MY BEING HONEST AMAS FAR AS LHIKE THE CAR BLOCKERS WAS LIKE SOME WHITE KIDTY BEING EXTRACT AND THOS SORTS OF THINGS THEY CAN TAM THEY DO BLOCK THE DIGESTION OF CARBA HYDRATE SOME SO WHEN I SAY BLOCK THAT'S THOSE WATCHING WERE LISTENING A MATABOLISM IS TYPICALLY NOT ON AN OFFSWITCHES O CASE N WESIN WHEN WE SAY THINGS LIKE BLOCK OR A TENUEIGHT OR INHIBIT TYPICALLY WERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST A SWITCH ON THE WALL THAT YOU PRESS IT AND EVERYTHING TURNS OFF WERE TALKN ABOUT A DIMMER SWITCH NO CI LIKE SO YOU IT JUST CHANGES THE EMPHASIS A BUT THESE CAR BLOCKERS CAN REDUCE THE ABSORPTION OF CARBAL HYDRATE NOW THEY DON'T SEEM TO CAUSE WEIGHT LOSS IT WHEN WHEN YOU JUST DO IT A NORMAL DIGHT NOW WHY IS THAT WELL ALL IT DOES IS ONCE THOSE CARBAL HYDRATES GET TO THE A LARGE AN TESTIN AND YOUR BACTERIO GET A HOLD OF HEM THEY START PERMITTING EM TO VOLATOLFATIACIDS WHICH COULD REABSORB INTO YOUR LIVER SOYOU DON'T GET THE INCREASE IN BLUGLUCOST BUT YOU STILL GET ALMOST ALL THE CALLORIES FROM IT BECAUSE IT JUST IN A DIFFERENT FORM SO ITW IF CAR BLOCKERS IF THEY ACTUALLY WORKED REALLY WELL I MEAN IF YOU BLOCK SOMETHING FROM BEING ABSORBED YOUR G I TYPICALLY DOES NOT JUST LET UNDIGESTED MATERIAL SITTIN THERE YOU GET DIARRHOEA I MEAN THAT WOULD BE THE OUTCOME IT'S ALSO HOW I LIKE DEBUNK THE WHOLE LIKE THIRTYGRAMS APPROACHING AT A MEAL YOU CAN ABSORB ANY MORE THAN THAT I'M LIKE IF THAT WAS THE CASE THE WHEN YOU ATE A STAKE LIKE YOU WOULD JUST START HAVING DIARHOEA EVERY TIME YOU WENT OVER THAT THIRTYGRAM THRESHOLD RIGHT I REMEMBER DURING COLLEGE SOS TO BE EARLY NINETIES THERE WAS THE OLASTRA CRAZE WEAS IDEA OF PUTTING IN NONDIGESTIBLE A THING IN TWO THINGS LIKE PARTATO CHIPS SO THAT IT WOULD I'M CLEAR THROUGH A THAT THE G I TRACT FASTER NOT ABSORB AS MANY GALLERIES IT DOES RAISE THIS  WENT NOWHERE OBVIOUSLY UM YOU DON'T HER ABOUT THIS ANY MORE BUT IT DOES RAIS AN INTERESTING QUESTION RELATE TO ENERGY BALANCE WHICH IS GASTRIC EMPTYING TIME IM AN OBVIOUSLY IN IN THE LANDSCAPE OF EATING DISORDERS IN PARTICULAR ANERAC YA ABUSIVE LACK USE IN ABUSIB A LAXITIVES IS A WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE WILL IN AN UNHEALTHY WAIY A TRYING CONTROL THEIR WAIG THERE'S A LOT OF PROLMISE WITH THAT A APPROACH BUT IM WHAT ABOUT GASTRICT EMPTYING TIME IS THIS ONE WAY THAT PEOPLE COULD UM CONTROL THEI'RE ENERGY BALANCE IN A HEALTHY WAY AN UM WHERE DOES FIBRA COME INTO PLAY A FIBR TINS TO IMPROVE GI TRANS AT TIME BECAUSE IT ADDS BULK SO YOU KNOW YOURE YOUR G I SYSTEM IS BASICALLY TO AND IT HAS PARISTALSIS WHICH IS WAVE LIKE CONTRACTIONS THAT MOVES THE FOOD DOWN TO THE TO WELL IF YOU HAVE MORE BULKED THE FOOD LIKE WITH FIBR YOU CAN MOVE IT THROUGH A LITTLIT BETTER NOW IN THE GASTRICT THE STOMACH SPECIFICALLY FIBR TENDS TO DELAY GASTRIC EMPTYING AND SLOW IT A BIT IM PROBABLE CAUSE IT CONGEALS A LITTLE BIT IM NOW THIS KIND OF GETS INTO LIKE THE GLISEMIC INDEX ARGUMENT RIGHT LIKE IF YOU DO O IF YOU DO LIKE LO G I FOODS YOU'LL HAVE A SLOWER RELEASE OF GLUE COSE AM IT'S A SLOWER GASTRIC EMPTYING TIME DOES THAT AFFECT ENERGY BALANCE AND SO THERE ARE QUITE A FEW STUDIES LOOKING AT LIKE LOG IVERSAS HYG I FOODS AM IN THE STUDIES WHERE THEY DON'T CONTROL CALORIES LO G I TENS TO OUT PERFORM HYG I BUT WHEN THEY CONTROL CALORIES THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE AND S WIT THAT TENDS TO SWHAT I THINK THAT SUGGESTS IS LOG I FOOD JUST BY THEIR NATURE TEND TO BE HIRER IN FIBRE AND SO I THINK IT IT JUST CINI COMES BACK TO THE FIBR ISSUE GOT IT I TO ASK YOU ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS FOR A MOMENT  IT'S AN ENORMOUS LANDSCAPE BUT I BELIEVE THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT YOU BELIEVE IN MEANING THEY EXIST AND AND THERE ARE DECENT DATA TOS SUPPORT THEIR USE MAYBE EVEN SOME ANIC DOTAL DATA BASED ON YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE AS LONG AS WE HIGHLIGHTED AS SUCH COULD BE INTERESTING I'VE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT TO IN PARTICULAR A ONE THAT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH WICH US CREATING MONO HYDRATE YOUD UM SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT NOT JUST FOR MUSCEL BUILDING BUT MAYBE ANY OTHER PURPOSES FOR IT AM AND TTHE OTHER ONE IS ONE THAT I'M FRANKLY 'M LEARNING MORE ABOUT ALL THE TIME NOW THANKS TO YOUR PROMPT WHICH IS REDOLIA ROSAI THINK I PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY AND UM AND WHY THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING OR OF USE TO PEOPLE YES SO TOUCHING ON CREATIN IT IS THE MOST TESTED SAFE AND EFFECTIVE SPORT SUPPLEMENT WE HAVE I MEAN IT JUST THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF STUDIES ON CREATON MONA HYDRATE NOW AND I I WOULD I WOULD SAY VERY CLEARLY TOO AM IF YOU USING ANY OTHER FORM OF CREATAN I THINK YOUR WASTING YOUR MONEY AM CREATIIN HYDRA CHLORIDE HAS SOME AM HIPE AROUND ID  IT'S APPARENTLY SITTLE MORE SOLUBLE AM THE CLAIM IS THAT YOU NEED LESS AM BUT THERE'S ONLY COUPLE STUDIES ON IT AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE IT IY MONO HYDRATE IS NOT PARTICULARLY EXPENSE NO IS BE BLY THERIN BUDGETS BUT IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T LAND IT'S NOT A GAGION BRAKE YET IT'S GOTTEN MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF COVIN SUPPLY CHANE ISSUES EVEN THE THERE'S FORMS AF CREATING THAT APPEAR TO BE AS GOOD LIKE HYDRA CHLORIDE BUT IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE AND IN THINGS LIK CREAT AN ETHEL ESTER HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE WORSE THAN CREATON MONA HYDRATE A BUFFERD CREATAN IS AS GOOD OR WORSE AND IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE SO I TELL PEOPLE JUST TAKE CREATON MONA HYDRATE IT IS TRIED IN TRUE IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO SATURATE THE MUSSEL CELLS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT WITH PHOSSEL CREATON AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT SO CREATAN I WORKS THER FREE DIFFRENT METHENOLOGIES ONE THROUGH INCREASING FOSSPIL CREATES IN CONTENT WHICH HULPS IM PROVE EXERCISE PERFORMANCE AM IT ALSO APPEARS TO REPROVE IN COVER  IT APPEARS TO IMPROVE RECOVERY AND IT CREASEES LEAN MASS A LOT OF WHICH IS THROUGH BRINGING WATER INTO THE MUSSEL CELLS BUT THAT IS MEAN MUSSEL CELLS ARE MOSTLY WATER SO WHEN PEOPLES O WACH THIS WATER THAT'S WHAT MUSSEL CELLS MOSTLY ARE A AND A IT ALSO IN CREASES STRENGTH AND S OME OTHER METRICS NOW IT ALSO HAS BEEN SHOW IN STUDIES THAT PEOPLE TEND TO GET A DECREASE IN BODY FAT PERCENTAGE NOW THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY'REGETTING IN INCREASE IN LEAN MASS AND SO THE RELATIVE IS A DECREASE IN BODY FAT PERCENTAGE BUT THERE ARE A FEW STUDIES TO SHOW AT DECREASE IN FAT MASS AS WELL I ONLY THE CREATANS AF FAT BURNER I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO TRAIN HARDER BUILD MORE LEAN TISSUE AND SO THAT'S PROBABLY HAVING AN EFFECT ON FAT MASS THEN THE FACTUALLY SHOWN MORE RECENTLY SOME COGULIVE BENEFITS TO CREATUM WHICH I FIND REALLY INTERESTING AS WELL BUT THE ONLY KNOCK ON CREATON THAT ANYBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO COME UP BECAUSE THEY AT THEY'VE DEBUNK THE KIDNEY STUFF THEY'VE DBUNK THE LIVER STUDED IT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THA THE HARM HELTHY COULDN' CIDNEYOR LIVER A IS HAIR LOSS SO WHAT ABYUT HAIRLOSS CAUSE THERE WAS ONE STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THAT SHOWED THAT CREATES AN INCREASE D H TIGUE A BUT THEY DIDN'T REALLY SHOW AN EFFECT ON ANY OTHER SEX FORMON SO IT'S KIND OF STRANGE LIKE YOU WOULD THINK IF THERE IS AN INCREASE IN D H T THERE WOULD BE LIKE SOMETHING ELSE THAT CHANGES AS WELL A AND IT'S ONLY ONE STUDY AND AGAIN DIDN'T DIRECTLY MEASURE HAIR LOSS MEASURE D H T WHICH WE KNOW AS INVOLVED IN THE LOSS OF THE FOLOCU THE FOLICAL SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT I AM NOT CONVINCED IT'S ONLY ONE STUDY NEVER BEEN REPLICATED TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND IT WAS LOOKING IN A MECHANISM RATHER THAN AN OUTCOME SO AH IF YOU IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOSE PRONE TAIR LOSS AND YOU WANT AVOID CREATINE BECAUSE OF THAT I UNDERSTAND BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE Y I DON'T THINK IT'S A I DON'T THIK IT SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT YOU EMEMPHASIZEA THE CLASSIC LOADING OF CREATINE TAKING IN A BUNCH OF TIMES PERDAY AND THEN BACKING OFF OR JUST TAKING AT CONSISTENTLY AT THE I THINK FIVEGRAMS PERDAY IS CON A TYPICAL A DOSE THAT PEOPLE TAKE SO AGAIN NO SOLUTIONS ONLY TRADE OFFS AM YOU CAN LOAD IT AND YOU WWILL SATURATE YOUR FALSPHOR CREATING PHOSPHI CREATS AN STORES FASTER LIKE USUALY WITHIN A WEEK A IF YOU JUST TAKE PHIOGRAMHS PER DAY IT'LL TAKE TWO THREE FOUR WEEKS AH BUT YOU WILL GET TO THE SAME PLACE AND YOURE PROBABLY GON HAVE A MUCH LOWER RISK OF G I ISSUES SOME PEOPLE IT CREATIN CAN BE A GOT IRRITANT A IF IT IS FOR  SOME FOLKS I RECOMMEND SPLITTING IT INTO MULTIPLE DOSES SO MAY BE LIKE MULTIPLE TO ONE OR TWO GRAMDOSES PER DAY AND DEFINLY DON'T LOAD IT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO HAS GUE I ISSUES FROM IT AS FAR AS A ROAL ROSAA THE RESEARCH IS STOLE ITS INFACY I WAS JUST READING A A NEW SYSTEMATIC REVIEW THAT KIND OF CONCLUDED THAT WE NEED MORE HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH BUT THE RESEARCH THAT IS OUT THERE SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT NOT ONLY DOES IT REDUCE PHYSICAL FATIGUE BUT ALSO REDUCES THE PERCEPTION OF FATIGUE AND MAY ALSO ENHANCE A MEMORY AN COGNITION AS WELL AND IT'S REFERRED TO AS AN ADAPTEGEN SO I I REALLY LIKE IT AM MY ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE IS WHEN I COMBIND THAT WITH CAFINE IT TENDS TO KIND OF SMOOTH OUT THE EFFECTS OF CAFFINE IT'S A MORE PLEASANT EX PERIENCE AND THERE'S ALSO SOME EVIDENCE THAT IF YOU WERE LIKE COMING OFF KAFFINE THAT IT CAN REDUCE THE AH THE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS TO KAFFING WITHDRAWL WHICH BY THE WAY I I DIDNT REALLY BELIEVE IN THAT UNTIL I ACTUALLY DID A COLD TURKEY A CASSLE BEFORE MEAT I WILL CUT OUT KAFFINE FOR SEVEN DAYS BECAUSE YOU CAN BASICALLY RESET YOUR AFFINE TOLERANCE IN SEVEN DAYS AND LIKE TWO DAYS AND I MEAN I'M GROGGY I'VE GOT THE HEAD ACHES USUALLY I'LL GET LIKE BODY ACHES THAT COME UP BECAUSE KAFFINE IS ACFTUAY A MILD ANALGESIC AM AND YAS SOS VERY INTERESTING TOS IT BY SLOPE LIKE A BABY I'LL TELL YOU THAT I TN NA O GA GAFFIN PRIORTY TO YOUR ESIMENT TO THE MEAT I YOU REALLY WANT THE MAXIMUM PUNCH RO YE THAT'S WHY YOU KDO THAT YET AND LIKE A SAID A RODIO AT TENDS TO IT DOESN'T ELIMINATE THOSE THOSE NEGATIVE EFFECTS BUT THEY TEND TO TENDS THE DAMP ON IM A LITTLE BIT SO I REALLY LIKE IT AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE RESEARCH ON IT BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE STUFF COMING OUT LIKE A ASHREGON DOES ANOTHER THING THAT LOOKS PRETTY PROMISING A SEEMS TO INCREASE TESTOSTRO AN MODEST SLEEP INTERESTING AM I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE THEY'VE SHOWN INCREASES IN LEAN MASS I DON'T THINK THE INCREASE IN TESTOSTRONE AH EXPLAINS THE INCREASE IN LEAN MASSAGE JUST NOT A BIG ENOUGH INCREASE COULD IT BE THE DECREASING QARTERS ALL PEOPLE AT TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE IT DOES IT DECREASE ASTRESS STRESS HORMONS IT IT ALSO HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HELPLESS SLEEP A BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE RESEARCH LOOKIN AT MECHANISTICALLY HOW IT'S INCREASINGLAN MASS BEFORE I KIND OF SAY CONCLUSIVELY THAT THIS IS THA YOUKNOW THE NEXT CREATON THERE'S MORE RESEARCH IN THESE TO COME OUT N THEN THERE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT THAT  HAVE AN EFFECT AM YOU KNOW SITRALY MALLET THERE THERE AS A NEW MENANALYSIS THAT SHOW THAT SITRLYN MALLET CAN REDUCE FATIGUE AND A INCREASE I THINK TIME TO FATIGUE AN MAY AX YO HAVE SOME SMALL RECOVERY BENEFITS AS WELL AM DIFFERENT FORMS OF CARNANE CARNATIN CONNACTULLY HAVE RECOVERY BENEFITS AND ACTUALLY INTERESTING AM I THINK IT'S CARNATINE TARTRAIT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN SHOWN A VOLLIC PUBLISH TO STUDY E ACTUALLY SHOW THAT INCREASED ANJOGEN RECEPTOR DENSITY AN MUSCLE SCELLS SATS INTERESTING NOW OL CARNATINE AND IT'S OTHER FORMS AT AR PRETTY I THEN THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN IMPROVE A MSPERMANAG HEALTH FOR PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO CONCEAL INTERESTING YET THEYRE AM SURPRISING NUMBER OF STUDIES ONNESS IN INHUMANCS AM BUT YET ANDROGEN RECEPTOR DENSITY AND THAT THAT'S FROM ORWELL CARNATINE PEERTIN CASTLES NOT INJECTING DIRECTLEN TO MUSCLAND THEN YOU'VE GOT THINGS LIKE OVIOUSLY LIKE THE OTHER MOST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENT OUT THERES PROBLI KAFINE I MEAN LIKE IF YOU LOOK A THE RESEARCH TUDIES KAFFINE PRODUSES VERY CONSISTENTLY IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE A SO THAT'S NOTHEWENT SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE EFFECT OF KAFNE NOT S OF KAY BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW COS AT NEVER COME OFF IT EEXACTLY EXACTLY WHY INTERESTINGLY THEY THEY DO SHOW THAT THE EFFECT APPEARS TO BE CONSISTENT THAT THAT EVEN IF YOUR A HABITUAL KAFFINE USER YOU DO STILL GET A BENEFIT EVERY TIME YOU TAKE IT BUT LIKE YOU SAKE YOURS USE TO IT YOU KNOW AM SO THE O THERES THOSE THIN S YOU THIN YOUVE GOT LIKE THINGS LIKE A MADE ALAMEN WHICH FOR IT'S IN OUR IT'S IN OUR PREWORK OUT PROBABLY NOT SUPERHELPFUL FOR A MOST PEOPLE FOR RESISTANCE TRAINING IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE SOME A BENEFITS FOR LIKE HIGH INTENSELY LIKE WOU GET OUT  KNO MORE THAN LIKE FORTY FIVE SECONDS OR SIXTY SECONDS OF LIKE RALLY HARD TRAINING IT DOES APPEAR TO HELP WITH THE LAYING FATIGUE FOR THAT I'M AND THEN YO'VE GOT THINGS LIKE A B TANE RE ALSO CALLED TRYMOTHALI SEEN WHICH THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE IT CAN IMPROVE LEAN MASS AM THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT IT CAN IM IMPROVE POWER OUT PUT SO THERES A FEW THINGS OUT THERE BUT YOU KNOW MOST THE STUFF IS NOT VERY GOOD SO YOU KNOW AH I THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THOSE KINDS OF SUPPLEMENTS YOU KNOW VERY USEFUL A BUT A GET I WILL NEVER TELL PEOPLE THEY NEED SUPPLEMENTS LIKE AGAIN EVEN LIKE SOMETHING LIKE CRITS AND IS GOING TO BE A VERY SMALL EFFECT COMPARED TO LIKE PROPER NEW TRITION RECOVERY AND HARD TRAINING YA ONE F THE THINGS I I WUS OVE TALKIN BEN BRUNO THE OTHER DAY AND I SAID YOU KNOW LIKE SOME PEOPLE WILL ASK ME LIKE HOW DOES THIS PERSON MAKE PROGRESS BECAUSE O KNOTHER PROGRAMMING AS IS NOT EVIDENCE BASED OR OR O THE SKYHOUSE HE LIKE ESHIS EXERCISE OR DUMB AND I I'LL SAY YET BUT THEY TRAIN REALLY HARD FOR TWENTY YEARS LIKE NONE COMMONALITY YOU SEE BETWEEN LIKE REALLY SUCCESSFUL ATHLETES OR BODY BUILDERS IS THEY TRAIN REALLY HARD AND ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE OBSERVED IS THE MORE IND O THE WEEDS PEOPLE TEND TO GET AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST MY OWN ANICDONTE OBSERVATION THE MORE IN THE WEEDS THEY TEND TO GET THE LESS HARD I SEE THEM TRAIN AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I REALY LIKE THAT A MIKE ISRAELTOLL SAID WHO'S GOT A P H T AND IS A BODYBLE ER HIMSELF HE SAID YOU CAN'T OUT SCIENCE HARD TRAINING THAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUILD MUSCLE AN YOUR LOOKING IMPROVER BODY COMPOSITION T THE MAIN THING IS JUST DOING THE WORK OVER TIME SILS Y AND THE HARD WORK AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT AND THIS IS TRUE A ACADEMIC ENDEAVORS IM TO OF COURSE I THINK I HOPE YOU'LL AGREE I'M ABSOLUTELY WI WHICH IS TAT YAH YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING HAS GIVEN THE MENTAL SIDE O EARLIER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW SOTIETY SIGNALS AND THE BRAIN AND WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT FOODS CAN BE RELEVANT LEARNING TO REALLY ENJOY TRAINING HARD IN ADDITION TO LEARNING TO REALLY ENJOY EATING WELL NOT JUST FOR THE EFFECTS THAT HAS ON BODY COMPOSITION IT COMPOSITION EXCUSE ME THOSE TO OF COURSE BUT JUST LEARNING TO REALLY ENJOY THE PROCESS OF TRAINING HARD AND A AND A REALLY HARD WORK OUT OR REALLY HARD I'M PAPER THAT YOU AVE THE SORT THROUGH OR REALLY DIGGING THROUGH A BOOK THAT'S CHALLENGING LEARNING TO REALLY ENJOY THAT I THINK IS IS A IF THERE IS A POWER TO GO OUT THERE IT'S IT'S THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS GETTING THE CONFIDENCE OF DOING SOMETHING HARD THAT THERE'S A PAY OFF AT THE END YOU KNOW IN A LOT O PEOPLE I GOUN ASKED A LOT MY CUNAYS HOW DO LIKE G T MORE CONFIDENT HOW I BECOME MORE CONFIDENT I'LL TELL PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DO YET THERE DERES NO HACK YOU CAN'T READ ABOUT YOU GONT TO GET NHEARENA AND I DON'T MEAN LIKE COMPETE IN SPORTS NECESSARILY BUT LIKE DOING A PAGETY OR DOING SOMETHING JUST SOMETHING HARD WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS MY GOAL WHEN I'M IN TOGO FOR IT YOU JUST LEARN SO MUCH BY DOING THAT ABOUT YOURSELF IM AND SO JUST WHAT YOU SAID I WILL REFRAME THINGS IN MY MIND WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN FROM IT'S NOT E SAD NEVER GET STRESSED OUT CAUSE I DO AND IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I NEVER GET DOWN BECAUSE I DO CAUSE I'M A HUMAN BUT WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED I SHOULD POST ABOUT THIS MY STORE TO DAY WHAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS I VERY RARELY ANY MORE TO I GO WOE IS ME WHY DO THIS HAPPEN TO ME BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE UNIVERSE RANDOM BAD THINGS ARE OIN TO HAPPEN SO IN'S THEAD I SAY  WILL IF I'M NOT DEAD IT'S THAT I SAY WELL WHAT AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO OVERCOME AN OBSTACLE AND I BAT BECAUSE IN THE SPIRITS OF MY LIFE THE BIGGEST LESSONS AND THE BEST THINGS OF MY LIFE HAVE ACTUALLY COME OUT OF THE MOST CHALLENGING WORST THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPEN AND SO AGAIN THIS IS I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THESE SORTS OF THINGS IF I HADN'T TAKEN UP WEIGHT LIFTING BECAUSE WEIGHT LIFTING TAUGHT ME SO MUCH ABOUT PERSEVERANCE THE LAID GRATIFICATION OVERCOMEING OBSTACLES AND THAT'S WHY LEVE ITING EVEN TO THIS DAY AND I'LL STILL GET BUTTERFLIES WHEN I GO IN FOR A SQUATSESSION EVEN THOUH I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS IT'S WONDERFUL WHAT'S CLEAR THAT YOU EMBRACE HARD THINGS AND I FOR PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS A OBBYUSEY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WEIGHT LIFTING YOU KNOW THINKING HARD THINGS LEARNING AND INSTRUMENT EARING IN LANGUAGE I'M CHALLENGE IS ISABIS A ABSOLUTE BUILDER AND THE FACTUALY SHOWN LIKE A THOSE SORTS OF THINGS LIKE WHEN YOU CHALLENGE YOURSELF AND ALSO MENTALLY THAT I I THINK THERE WAS A NEW STUDY THAT CAME OUT BASILY SHOWING A REDUCTION IN THE RISK OF ALLSHIMERS AND OTHER AGE REALLY THE COG DECLINE TO BEN BASICALLY LIKE USE IT OR LOSE IT RIGHT YHAVE THAT THE THE WILL THE DESIRE AND THE WILL I'M TO PERSEVERE I NO DOUBT TRANSLATES TO THIS THING WE CWE CALL THE WILL TO LIVE RIGHT IT'S IT'S RELATED TO THE WILL TO LIVE WELL I THINK THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID YOU ON BEAUTIFULLY EMBODIES WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE ASPIRING TO WHICH IS TO I THINK MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO DO HARD THINGS I THEY DON'T JUST WANT TO HAVE A THE RESULTS I THINK THAT MUST BEEL DEEP DOWN UNDER HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING THAT THEIRE REWARD SYSTEM WORKS THAT WAY I MUST SAY THIS CONVERSATION FOR ME AS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY REWARDING FIRST OF ALL ALLOWE ME TO MEETYOU IN PERSON FOR THE FIRST TIME SHA'VE REALLY ENJOYED I'M CERTAIN THIST WON'T BE AR LAST INTERACTION ON THIS PODCAST AND AND ELSEWHERE I ALSO THE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU CONTAIN INSIDE YOU IS IS ASTONISHING AND THERE'S LOS STUFF RATTLE AROUND TER AND AND WE ALL BENEFIT BECAUSE YOU'RE ABILITY TO PULL FROM THE MECHANISTIC SIDE AGAIN I THINK IN NOT LIMITED TO BUT RELATE TO YOUR BACKGROUNDING BO COMISTRY ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE UM THE IMPACT IN HUMANS ANIMAL STUDIES BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE SIT RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER AND THEN YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A PRACTITIONER OF A YOU PRACTISE WHAT YOU PREACH AND WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT PERTAINS TO MEN TO WOMEN YOUNGER PEOPLE OLDER PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE VIGAN KETO CARNIVOR YOU REALLY ARE ABLE TO NET A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF IDEAS WHILET STAYING REALLY NUW ANCE AND DATA DRIVEN AND SO S O UT SAY FOR MYSELF AND NON BEHAFF THE LISTENERS REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING IN HERE TO DAY AND AND SHARING WITH US YOUR KNOWLEDGE WE WILL ABSOLUTELY POINT PEOPLE IN THE DIRCTION OF IM WHERE THEY CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT YOU AND UM ONE OF THE PLACES A THAT I ONE I DOUFLY WONE TO MENTION BEFORE WE WE PART HOWEVER IS UM THIS CARBON AP AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION I'M NOT THIS ISN'T A PAID PROMOTION OR ANYTHING THAT SORT ACTULLY ONE OF OUR PODCASTTEE MEMBERS IS HAS BEEN USING CARBON FOR A LONG TIME THIS IS AN AP THAT YOU DEVISED WHICH ALLOWUS PEOPLE TO NAVIGATE THE EXERCISE NUTRITION ENERGY BALANCE SPACE FOR WAIT LOST MUSCLE GAIN FAT LOST WEIGHT MAINTENANCE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BRIEFLY ASK YOU ABOUT THAT BEFORE WE CON CLUDE UM WITHOUT NECESSARILY TELLING US EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE CARBON AP I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE MAJOR THINGS THAT IT DOES AND IS GOOD FOR AND THEN WHAT WERE SOME OF THE KEY THINGS THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE WERE IN THERE WHEN YOU BUILT IT LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE SORT OF LOGICAL BACKBONE BEHIND IT CAUSE I THINK THER'RE A LOT OF AM FOOD COUNTING CALLORY COUNTING EXERCISE APS OUT THERE U EVERYONE I'VE TALK TOU THAT YUSES CARBON IM INCLUDING OUR MUTUAL FRIEND CIGAR AND GETTY THIS MEMBER OF MY PODCASTS ET CETERA RAVES ABOUT IT SO WHAT IS CARBON AND AND BUT WHAT IS IT DO AND WHAT WAS YOUR MIND SET IN BUILDING IT WHAT DID YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THERE THAT YO DIDN'T SEE ELSEWHERE SO THOSE THOSE THING MAY NOT KNOW BUT I REALLY I STARTED ON LINE COACHING PEOPLE FOR NUTRITIAN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND THAT WAS THE THE VAST MAJORITY OF MY BUSINESS ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL LIKE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND I HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS FOR THAT WHERE WHETHER WHETHER IT BE JUST AVERAGE FOLKS LOOK INTO LOSE WEIGHT OR BUILD MUSCLE AND RIGHT UP TO ILLY LEVEL A COMPENITORS AND PHYSIQUESPORT SO I KIND O HAD THIS IDEA LIKE I WASS N'T I THE IDEA A FEW PEOPLE HAVE THE IDEA WHAT IF WE COULD TAKE WHAT I DO IN COACHING AND TRY TO AUTIMATE AS MUCH OF THAT AS POSSIBLE CAUSE YOU DON'T BY THE TIME I WAS BECOMING A REALLY POPULAR COACH A AN I WAS EXPENSIVE YOU THOUG YOUERE LOOKING IT LIKE ME TO ME CHARGING I GOPT THE POINT RY CHARGEING ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR COACHING RIGHT AND NOT I'L MOST PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD THAT AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOT JUST COACH RICH PEOPLE  YOU DON'T I MAN HIWOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE SO THE IDEA WAS TO CREATE AN AP THAT COULD DO SOME OF THE STUFF NOW THERE'S ALWAYS A PLACE FOR HUMAN INTERACTION BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THAT OUR AP IS BASELY TEN BUCKS A MONTH AND BASELY WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS SET UP AN AP WERE THINK ABOUT IF YOU WENT TO ANATRICIAN COACH WUT WHAT WOULD THEY DO THEY WOULD PROBABLY ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR GOALS A TAKE SOME ANTHROMETRICS A AND THEY WULD USE LIKE THAT INFORMATE MAY BE DIETARY PREFERENCE AND THEN YUSE THAT INFORMATION TO COUNT OF FORMULATE A BASELIGNE PLAN THAT'S WHAT CARBON DOES SO WE ASK YOU I THINK THERE'S EIGHT QUESTIONS IN THE SIGN UP FLOW ABOUT LIKE YOUR ACTIVITY AM YOUR EXERCISE YOUR LIFE STILE YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT WE HOP YOU CALCULATEED IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING A AND THEN YOU DIETARY PREFERENCES AND WE USE THAT TO COME UP WITH KIND OF YOUR BASELINE AND YOUR BASELINE WILL BE YOU KNOW YOUR CALORIES YOU'REPROACHING YOUR COPIRATES AND FATS AND WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT OUR AP IS LIKE APSOLIKE A YOU NOW MY FITNESS POWERER WILL DO THAT AS WELL AH WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT OURS IS YOU WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOG THEIR WEIGHT DAILY FOR THE REASONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AAND THEN YOU CAN ALSO TRACK YOUR FOOD IN THE AP AND ODESTLY I THINK OUR FOOD TRACKER IS ACTUALLY LIKE WASER TO USE THEN MOST OF NOT THERE ARE ARE WHET WE TYPICALLY GET GREAT RAVE REVIEWS ABOUT IS HOW USE OUR FRIENDLY OUR ENTERFACEIS THAT IT MAKES INTO IT OF SENSE AND SO YOU TRACK YOUR FOOD TRY TO HIT THESE THESE MACKROES THAT YOU'R PRESCRIBED AND EACH WEEK YOU WILL BE PROMPTED TO CHECK IN WITH THE COACH ON YOUR CHECKIN DAY AND THEN YOU YOU PUT IN SOME INFORMATION AND THEN BASED ON HOW YOUR PROGRESSING THE AP WILL A JUST OR NOT A JUST BASE ON HIGYEUR PROGRESSING SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'R HITTING AWEIGHTLOST PLATEAU IT WILL SINSE THAT AND IT WILL YOUNOWL REDUCE YOUR CALORIES OR OR IF YOUR TRYING TO GAIN WEIGHT AND YOUR YOU KNOW HHITL PLATEAU ILL INCREASOURE CALRIES AND THERE'S A LOT OF YOU O BACK IND ALGARITHM STUFF THAT IT TAKES CARE OF THIS BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL CRUCKS OF THE AP IS WE WE TRY TO DETERMINE YOUR TOTAL DAILY ENERGY EXPENITURE BECAUSE HAT'S CONG TO TELL US THE FIRST BIG THING WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH IS HOW MANY CALORIES DO YOU NEED TO BE EATING FOR YOUR GOAL RIGHT SO ON THE FRONT END WE WE BASICALLY AM DO OUR BEST GUESS BASE ON YOUR ATHROMATRICS NOT CAN BE PERFECT BUT I'LL GIVE US IN THE BALL PARK AND IF YOU DO KNOW LIKE SOME PEOPLE ALREA YOU KNOW WHILE I KNOW WHAT I MAINTAIN MY BODY WEIGHT ON THERE'S ACLIOST BOT WE CAN MANMANUALLY ENTER THAT DURING THE SIGN UPFLOW SO THAT'S HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPERNERVES LIKE ME A BUT THEN IF YOU'R JUST PEOPLE WIL ASK WHAT YOU DO YOU TAKE APPLE WATCH DATA YOU TAKE THIS TOU TAKE THAT AND KNOW FOR THE REASONS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IT OVER ESTIMATES ENERGY EXPENITURE WHAT OUR APT DOES IS IT'S AN ALGEBRA QUATION IF YOU BECAUSE YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR YOUR MAINTENANCE CALORIES IS YOUR TOTAL DAILY ENERGY EXPENITURE YOUR AVERAGE CALORIES THAT YOU EAT TO ME NTAIN YOUR BODY WEIGHT WILL BE THE SAME AS YOU'RE TOLD DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE SO IF WE KNOW HOW BODY WEIGHT IS CHANGING AND WE KNOW HOW MANY CALORIES THE PERSONS CONSUMING WE CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE FOR WHAT ENERGY EXPENDITURE IS H ND YOU CAN SEE IN THE AP THAT WILL OTHERS TA KIND OF A A MAINTNANCE CALORY  TRACKER OR ENERGY EXPENDITURE TRACKER AND TYMICALLY AFTER ABOUT THREE TO FOUR WEEKS EVEN IF THE AP WAS OFF AT FIRST IT WILL HAVE YOU PRETTY DARN CLOSE BECAUSE LETK LET'S SAY SOMEBODY A COMES ON AND THEY THEIR GOAL IS TO LOSE YOU KNOW POUND AND HALF A WEEK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THE FIRST WEEK THEY LOSE THREE POUNDS NOW THE AP ACTUALLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT YOU CAN LOSE MORE WATER WEIGHT THE FIRST WEEKS THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET AN ADJUSTMENT BUT LET'S SAY THE NEXT WEEK THEY LOSE THREE POUNDS THE AP WILL SINCE THAT AND A JUST THEIR CALORIES UP BECAUSE IT WILL BE ESTIMATING THAT THEIR ENERGY EXPENDITURES TO ACIN HIGHER THEN WHAT ID PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATEED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THE'RE LOSING AND THE SAME THING GOES IN REVERSE IF THE'RE NOT LOSING THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THATHERE 'SUPPOSE TO AH IT WILL LOWER THEM BASE ON THE FACT THAT IT MAY HAVE OVERESTIMATED THEIR ENERGY EXPENDITURE BUT A THAT'S THE FIRST CRUX OF IT IS TRACKING THAT ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND THEN THE NEXT THING IS PROACHING SO WHEN THE THE BACK END ALGARO THEM STUFF HAS HAPPENING CALORIES ARE SET FIRST BASED ON YOUR ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND YOUR GOAL SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVEN A YOUON RESSIVFE DIET A YOUR CALORIES YONG TO BE LOWER EVEN IF YOUR ENERGY EXPENDITURE MY PEOPLE BUT HIGH A JUST BECAUSE EF YOU TRIND O LOOSE TWO POUNDS A WEEK I MEAN YOU'REGONG TO BE IN A PRETTY AGGRESS OFE CALORY DEFFICIT SO TH CUS TAT THE CALORIES FIRST THEN IT WILL SET PROACINE BASE ON YOUR LEAN BODY MASS THEN THE CALORIES THAT ARE LEFT OVER WILL BE ALLOTTED TO CARBA HYDRATE AND FAT DEPENDING ON YOUR DIETARY PREFERENCE AND WE HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT DIETARY PREFERENCES THERE'S BALANCED WHICH IS A ABOU FIFTY FIFTY TO SIXTY FORTY CROBAHYDRATE TO FAT OF THE REMAINING CALORIES THEN YOU HAVE LOW FAT WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY HIGHER RATUE OF CARBAHYDRATE YOU HAVE LOW CARB YOU HAVE A KEE TOGINIC DIET WHICH IS VERY VERY LOW CARB AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A PLANT BASED OPTION AND WITHIN EACH OF THOSE OPTIONS STILL YOU CAN GO IN AND ACTUALLY SHIMMY THE MACKROES A LITTLE BIT WITHIN A CERTAIN RANGE SO THAT YOU CAN KIND OF DIAL IN WHAT YOUR SPECIFIC DIETARY PREFERENCES BECAUSE AGAIN IF WE GO BACK TO WHAT IS GOING TO PRODUCE THE BEST LONG TERM RESULTS IT'S WHATEVER THE PERSON CAN ADHERE TO SO WE REALLY TRY TO START WITH THE CONCEPT OF ADHERENCE BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE THE DIETARY PREFERENCE THAT THEY WANT AND THERE'S ANOTHER APPSOUT THERE THAT ARE GOOD APS LIKE A FOR EXAMPLE WE GAT ASLOT WITH THE DRNOUR AP AND THE RENISSANCE PERITIZATION AP AND THEY HAVE A GREAT AP ABUT THERE'S IS KIND OMORE RIGID AND ITILL SAY YOU DON'T YOUR NEED THIS MANY MEALS AND YOU CAN HAVE THESE FOODS AT THESE TIMES SO WORK ON THE OPPOSITE WE WANT TO GIVE YOU MAXIM FLEXIBILITY NOW FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY WOULD PREFER THE THE RIGID STRUCTURE AT FIRST BUT WE FIND THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE GIVING THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY A TYPICALLY IMPROVES IT HERE AND OVER THE LONG RUN SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW THE AP WORKS AND AGAIN LIKE THERE'S MOLTIPLE DIFFERENT GOALS IS NOT JUST AWAIT LOS AP THERE'S A MAINTENANCE THERE'S A MUSSLIBILITING A SO YOU'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT GOALS THAT CAN BE ACCOMMODATED DIFFERENT RATES OF EACH OF THOSE GOALS AND I MEAN I'VE USED THE AP FOR OVER THREE YEARS NOW TO DO MY BODY WA AND I MEAN LIKE WHAT I SAY THAT IT'S DILED ME AND BECAUSE I I'M VERY REGIMENTED WITH MET O LOGGING IN AND AND LOGGING MY WAIGHT SO WHAT I TARGETED TO WEIGH IN AT WORLDS I GOT DOWN TO THE POINT ONE KILEGRAM SO IE'S ERE'S PRETTY COOL TO BE ABLE TO LIKE USE A TOOL THAT I HOPE DEVELOP TO ACTUALLY COACH ME SO IT'S A GREAT TOOL IM YOU KNOW WE WE WE DID SOME SITISTICS WE PULL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS AND OW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE ASK IS WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND AND NINETY ONE PER CENT SAID YES SO WE WE ARE OUR AVERAGE I THINK OUR AVERAGE RETENTION IS LIKE SEVEN MONTHS WHICH FOR AN APT THAT COSTENDOLLARS A MONTH IS IS REALLY GREAT SO YAS I MENTION A NUMBER OF PEOPLE I KNOW USE IT THIS IS NOT A PAP PROMOTION I UM BUT I THINK PEOPLE NEED GUIDANCE AND TOOLS AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN AS THAT WINGING IT CAN WORK BUT THAT A THE BRAIN WILL CHEAT ITSELF OFTEN AM WHAT THERE'S A FINE MEN QUOTE ABOUT THIS AND I'LL GET IT WRONG AND  ALWAYS BAD TO TRY AND QUOTE FINEMEND BECAUSE HE SAID IT SO MUCH BETTER BUT THAT WE ARE THE EASIEST O YOU IT'S EASY TO FOOLAR OURSELVES BASY IS WHAT HE WAS SAY EASY YES TO  ABSOLUTELY UM SOUNDS GRAPE WE WILL PUT A LINK TO IT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN O'M CHECK IT OUT AGAIN AT SOUNDS LIKE O A WONDERFUL TOOL AND AN A TOOL THAT NATS A LOT OF THE THE PRINCIPLES THAT SIT AS IM MAJOR STHEEMS FOR WEIGT LOSS WEIT GAIN I WOULD ASSUME A DIRECTED A LEAN MUSCLE A LEAN TISSUE GAIN IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE AFTER YON WEIT MAINITS BECAUSE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAINTAIN LISTEN I REALLY APPRECIATE

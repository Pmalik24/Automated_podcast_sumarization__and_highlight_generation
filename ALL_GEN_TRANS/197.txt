OUR MINDS AROUND IT SELF PRESERVATION THE WORLD IS SO FULL OF DANGEROUS THINGS THINGS THAT MIGHT HURT US IF WE LOOK TOO CLOSELY AT THEM SO WE AVOID WE SIRCUMVENT WE CHOOSE NOT TO GO THERE THAT'S I'LL SHOW TO DAY IN THREE ACTS PEOPLE FINDING THIS ONE PLACE IN THEIR LIVES THEY SIMPLY CAN ACCESS FOR REASONS THAT SOMETIMES EVEN THEY DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THER JUST A MENTAL KEEP OUT SIGN ON THE DOOG DO NOT LOOK DO NOT PASS GO DO NOT COLLECT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS STAY WITH US WE ACKED ONE COULD HAV GROWN BIG IN JAPAN AT'S GO  CAT'SGA IS A COMEDIAN AND SHE'S INCREDIBLY CLOSES WITH HER GRANDMA BEING SHE THEY TOLK SEVERAL TIMES A DAY THET TOGETHER EVERY WEEK AN AND THAT'S GO MAKES THESE INCREDIBLE VIDIOS OF HERSELF DANCING WHILE HER GRANDMOTHER PLAYS INCIDENTAL HIPE WOMAN HER GRANDMA RAISED HER BUT FOR A WHILE NOW THAT'S GOTRIK ON STAGE THAT HER GRANDMOTHER STOLE HER FROM HER DAD WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE AD BROUGHT HER AND HER MOTHER FROM TRAPAN TO LIVE IN THE OU ES FROM OUTSIDE SHE LOOKS SUCH A SWEET ON A SO MAN OLD ASIA WOMAN U KNO BUT SHE'S A LIAR SHE ALIAR WHEN I WAS A A SHE TOLD ME WE WERE COMING TO THE STAGE FOR A TWO MONTHS VACTATION SO I PACK LIKELY AND THEN WE NEVER LEFT YOU NOYA SRUE STORY YAT YAH AND YOU KNOW TILL THE STAY WERE STILL DEALING WITH THE KIDNAPPING A AR WAYS BUT THE TRUTH IS TAT'S GO ON WE HAS THE SKETCHIEST IDEA OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED SE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW HOW SHE ENDED UP IN AMERICA A FAMILY DOESN'T DISCUSS IT TALKING ABOUT IT HAS BEEN A NO GOSIN FOR HER IN HER FAMILY BUT RECENTLY THAT'S G DECIDED TO FIND OUT BECAUSE MY FAMILY DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THIS AS A KID ALL I NEW WAS I WAS LIVING IN JAPAN AND SUDDENLY I WASN'T I WAS SEPARATED FROM MY DAD AND MY FRIENDS I WAS FORCED TO GO TO SCHOOL IN AMERICA AND LEARN ENGLISH AND START A NEW LIFE I WENT BY STACY FOR TWO MONTHS IT WAS DAWING AND CONFUSING AND I BLAME MY DAD FOR GIVING UP ON US AND LEAVING US IN AMERICA THEN A'SNAN ADULT THAT SHIFTED I DECIDED MY GRANDMA WAS THE BAD GY SHES STOLE ME AWAY FROR MY DAD AND HE WAS THE VICTIM BUT I NEVER ASKED ANYBODY THE HARD QUESTIONS TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL TRUTH IT WAS WAY EASIER TO JUST TALK ABOUT IT ON STAGE WHEN NOBODY COULD FIGHT YOU ON WHETHER IT'S REAL OR NOT THAT'S WHY I LOVE STAND UP NOBODY TALKS BACK TO YOU IT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT ACROSS HIS FEELINGS AND THEN MY DAD HAD A STROKE HE SURVIVED IT AND IS RECOVERING BUT IT WAS KIND OF E WACE UP CALL AND MI REALLY DONE I NEVER ASK WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY MOVE TO THE UNITED STATES ME IT WAS THE BIGGEST EVEN IN MY LIFE IT COMPLETELY CHANGED EVERYTHING TIME TO GET ANSWERS WHAS I KIDNAP WHAT REALLY HAPPEN  A IN  ORTING AS AS  I  OH GRANDMA O SO I STARTED WITH MY GRANDMATHE PERPETRATER AND CONFRONTED HER FACE TO FACE SHE AND MY MAM LIVED JUST TWENTY MINUTES AWAY DID YOU KIDNAP ME DID YOU KIDNAP ME THAT'S WHAT I TELL AUDIENCES WHEN I PERFORM I SAY YA MY GRANDMA PRETTY MUCH KIDNAP ME BON JAHL IT'S ONLY WES SOTA WAS TOFANCE YOUN IN THAT SHE'S SAING AND MANDER AN THERE'S NO SUCH THING I DIDN'T KIDNAPYOU YO'LL DO IN BAN YAT YE COULDAN TAO NA YEL GO LONG TAT THOSE OUT KIN WHEN PEOPLE KIDNAP A CHILD THEY DEMAND MONEY RANSOM TO RE TURN THE CHILD BUT WE DIDN'T ASKED FOR THAT SO IT DOESN'T COUNT AS KIDNAPING THAT'S ON Y ME TE SO SO SO IT WAS SOMETHAN Y O I SHE DN'T ASKE FOR RANSOM SHE'S STILL A KIDNAPER SHE'S JUST BAD AT IT SHE TOOK A ID TO RAISE FOR FREE CAN YOUOU IMAGINE TRUNNIN NEG OTIATE WITH THE KIDNEPPER AND YOU'RE LIKE PLEASE HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT I JUST WANT MY KID BACK AND TE LIK OH KNO IT'S ALL ME FREE IN FACT I'LL TAKE HER TO ELAY FOR YOU I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE A STAR I'M GLAD MY GRANDMA AND I CAN JOKE ABOUT THESE THINGS TO DAY WE SAT ON MY COUCH IN HER LIVING ROOMS WE I TOLD HER I THINK OUR FAMILY HAS A HABIT OF NOT SPEAKING ABOUT DIFFICULT THINGS WOMAN THE CASI GOOD I THINK SEE YOU EDA SHE GAS O WID JON TULI DON'T SHE AS WE TALK MY MAMMA INTERRUPTS US FROM THE TOP OF THE STAIRS MY MAMM IS WITH HER   O CA MASHE'S ASKING MY GRANDMOTHER TO PLEASE NOT TALK ABOUT THESE SAD THINGS IT'LL EFFECT HOW I SEE MY LIFE BLES E WA WAN A IT WON'T I ASKED HER I YELLED MDON'T SANT SHE SAYS TRY NOT TO TALK ABOUT ANYETHING TOO SAD E ARY IT'S GOOD TO TALK ABOUT THE PAST MY MAMM GOES BACK TO HER ROOM SO A BIG REASON WHY WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THINGS IS BECAUSE OF MY MAM SHE HAS PARONOID SKITS APHRANIA AND TALKING BOUT SAD THINGS CAN TRIGGER BAD MEMORIES AND THE VOICES IN HER HEAD SO ANY TIME WE WANT TA TALK ABOUT THE PAST WE HAVE TO TIPTOE ROUND HER WE WHISPER WERE JUST AVOID IT COMPLETELY AND THAT'S HOW OUR FAMILY HAS ALWAYS DONE THINGS WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT HOW MY MAMM HAS KETS O PHRANIA LIKE AS A KID MY GRANDMA WOULD JUST SAY OH YOUR MAMM JUST HAS LITTLE BLOOD SUGAR SHE'S HUNGRY WHEN SHE WAS CLEARLY WILDING OUT THROWING PLATES AT GRANDMA IT'S LIKE A SHE NEEDS PROFESSIONAL HELP NOT BREAD  N         I WAS EAGER TO HEAR MY DAD SIDE OF THIS  FOR STARTERS WHEN THEY DIVORCED DID HE HAVE CUSTODY OF ME BECAUSE IF HE DID THIS SEEMS O WAY MORE LIKE A REAL KIDNAPPING AND DID HE EVEN KNOW THAT MY GRANDMA WAS TAKING ME TO THE UEST WE TALK LIKE ONCE A MONTH WE RE CONNECTED WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN SO I FLUTED JAPAN TO SEE

STAY UP AND WELCOME HIM HOME FROM WORK HE'D MAKE INSENT JAPANESE CURRY OUT OF A BAG FOR ME THEN HE WOULD LAY ON HIS SIDE ON THE FLOOR AND WATCHED AN US BEFORE BED TIME I WOULD LAY BESIDE HIM COPPING HIS POSE I WANTED TO BE LIKE HIM WE WALK ACROSS THE STREET FROR MY OLD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO AN OLD APARTMENT BUILDING IF I THERE IS A PERIOD I LIVED HERE IN JAPAN WITH MY MAMMA AND GRANDMA  SEPARATED

BUT THEN MONTHS LATER THE NEXT TIME THE SONG CAME ON I FOUND MYSELF FEELING READLY ON EDGE I FOUGHT ABOUT SKIPPING IT BUT JUST AS QUICKLY I ALSO FOR THAT'S RIDICULOUS SO I KEPT THE SONG PLAIN LATER THAT DAY AFTER A CONCERT BAND REHEARSAL I PUT MY BACK BACK DOWN TO HELP A FRIEND MOOSON CHAIRS AND SOMEBODY STOLE IT PRESUMABLY FOR THE LAP TOP INSIDE I WENT THE REST OF THE SURMESTER WITHOUT PERSONAL COMPUTER I W'LL SHREEKED OUT YOU KNOW HOW IN HOREMOOVIS THERES ALWAYS THAT MOMENT WHERE THE HAPPY COUPLE FINALLY REALIZED THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BOOKED A GREAT WEEK AN GET AWAY AT A CABIN AFTER ALL AND TAT THEVIBES ARE MOST DEFINITELY OFF THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE AFTER THAT EVEN TNOUGH I KNEW IT WASN'T RATIONAL I TRIED TO AVOID THE SONG BUT IT DIDN'T WORK THE ONLY BIKE ACCIDENT I'VE EVER BEEN IN HAPPENED AFTER I HEARD IT BEING PLAYED BY A PASSING CAR ONE TIME IT CAME ON DURING A LONG ROAD TRIP AND THE NEXT TIME I STOPPED I NOTICED A NAIL IN ONE OF MY TIRES WHEN I WAS PREPARING TO RUN MY FIRST MARAPHON I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAILESS AND MY PHOWN PLAYED A BIT OF THE SONG BEFORE I COULD TURN IT OFF FEW HOURS LATER MY SISTER CALLED ME AND TOLD ME E MANUAL OUR PARENTS ARE GETTING DIVORSED THE NEXT MORNING I FORGOT TO BRING MY HEAD FONS TO THE RACE AND FOR THE NEARLY FIVE HOURS IT TOOK ME TO RUN TAMARAPHON ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WHEN MY PARENTS THEIR MARRIAGE AND THAT SONG WHICH HAPPENS TO BE A SAPPY LOVE SONG ENDLESSLY LEEPING IN MY HEAD TOOI KNOW ALL OF THI SOUNDS ILLUSION ON A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I TRIED TO CONVINCE MYSELF ONCE AND FOR LL THAT THE SONG WAS JUST A SONG BUT IT BACK FIRES SPECTACULARLY I DECIDED TO PLAY EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH I WAKE UP PLAY THE SONG AND THEN WALK AROUND THE REST OF THE DAY TELLING MYSELF NOT TO WORRY WHEN NOTHING BAD HAPPENED FOR THREE DAYS I FELT RELIEVED I THEN ON THE FOURTH DAY I SUFFERED A FREEK RIST INJURY WHICH PLAGUED ME FOR NINE MONTHS TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE BECAUSE I'D PLAYED IT SO MUCH SPOT IF I KEPT PUSHING ME THE SONG I THER MONTHS AFTER TE ACCIDENT BECAUSE IT FOR I WANTED TO HEAR IT THAT YEAR WAS BY FAR THE WORSE YOUR OF MY TWENTIES MY HAIR WHICH UNTIL THAT POINT WAS DECENTLY ROBUR STARTED FALLING OUT AGGRESSIVELY MI LONG TIME FIMELLY CAT THIAD I WENT FOR A MASSIV BREAK UP MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE WAS UNMERS I GOT COVID WRITE BEFORE CHRISTMAS SO I SPENT MY FIRST EVER CHRISTMAS COMPLETELY ALONE AND IT PUSHD ME TO DO SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE DONE YEARS EARLIER I ADDED FOR GROUP THAT SINGS THA SONG TO MY DO NOT PLAY LIST ON SPODIFY WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THE SONG IT IS GOOD WITH A CAPITAL J IT IS ONE OF THOSE ARANBY DISGOBATERS FROM THE SEVEN IES THAT IS SO RIDICULOUSLY HAPPY SO POSITIVE IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF THE SEVENTES WERE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC AMORCAS HAV EVER BEEN OR IF THINGS WERE ACTUALLY SOBLAKU ARTIS HAD TO MAKE SONGS LIKE THIS ONG T A KNOW I WILL NOT BE PLAYING WITH THE SONG OR NAMING IT IS POISON TO ME A SKEPTICAL FRIEND OF MINE POINTED OUT THAT YES BAD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN I HEAR THE SONG BUT DON'T BAD THINGS HAPPENED TO ALL OF US ALL THE TIME MAYBE I JUST NOTICED THEM WHEN THE SONG PLAYS HE SUGGESTED I TRIED TO KEEP TRACK OF EVERY UNFORTUNATE EVENT I ENCOUNTER WITHOUT THE SONG SO I COULD SEE ONCE AND FOR ALL FELLS NOTHING TO THIS DSO I DID IT I LISTED EVERY TINY THING OVER A COURSE OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I WAM SURPRISED BY HOW MANY THERE WERE EVEN IF THEY WERE SMALL I CUT MYSELF ON A METAL CAN ACCIDENTALLY GOT BLEACH OR ONE OF MY FAVOURITE TEASHETS GOT INTO A NEVER ENDING BACK AND FORTH ITH MY HEALTH INSURANCE OVER ALMOST TWENTY CLAIMS FOR DIDN'T WANT TO PAY I SPENT HALF OF THE FAMILY WEDDING IN THAT YARE BECAUSE A GUEST PASST OUR OF AT RECEPTION I KNOW I AM SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THAT LIST AND FEEL FREED HE'LL FINALLY ABLE TO LISTEN TO THAT SONG WHENEVER I

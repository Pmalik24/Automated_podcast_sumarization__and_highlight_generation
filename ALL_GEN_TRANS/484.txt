WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LANPONCENS  AF SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO I MAY DRHUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEURABOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIOLOGY OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT TO DAY HAPPENS TO BE VALENTINE'S DAY TWENTY TWENTY TWO HOWEVER THE THEMES WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS PERTAIN TO DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND INDEED THE MECHANISMS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS ALMOST CERTAINLY WERE AT PLAY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO AND NO DOUBT WILL STILL BE AT PLAY IN OUR MINDS AND IN OUR BODIES AND IN OUR PSYCHOLOGIES FOR THE DECADE CENTURIES AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO COME INDEED TO DAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON CORP MECHANISMS THAT LEAD INDIVIDUALS TO SEEK OUT OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM TO MATE WITH WITH WHOM TO HAVE CHILDREN WITH OR NOT WITH WHOM TO ENTER SHORT OR LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH AND PERHAPS TO AND THOSE RELATIONSHIPS OR TO SEEK RELATIONSHIPS ON THE SIDE SO CALLED IN FIDELITY I'MCERTAINLY NOT GOING TO ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE ANY OF THESE BEHAVIORS I AM SIMPLY GOING TO COVER THE PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC DATA ON ALL THESE ASPECTS OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT I'M GOING TO DISCUSS HOW OUR CHILDHOOD ATTACHMENT STYLES AS THEY ARE CALLED INFLUENCE OUR ADULT ATTACHMENT STYLES YES YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT HOW WE ATTACHED OR DID NOT ATTACHED TO PRIMARY CAREGIVERS IN OUR CHILDHOOD HAS MUCH TO DO WITH HOW WE ATTACH OR FAIL TO ATTACH TO ROMANTIC PARTNERS AS ADULTS BECAUSE THE SAME NERL CIRCUITS THE NURONS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THE UNDERLIE ATTACHMENT BETWEEN INFANT AND CARE GIVER BETWEEN TODDLER AND PARENT OR OTHER CARE GIVER AND DURING ADOLESCENCE IN OURTEENAGE YEARS ARE REPURPOSED FOR ADULT ROMANTIC ATTACHMENTS I KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE ERIE TO THINK ABOUT BUT INDEED THAT IS TRUE NOW THE FORTUNATE THING IS THAT REGARDLESS OF OUR CHILDHOOD ATTACHMENT STYLES AND EXPERIENCES THE NERAL CIRCUITS FOR DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT ARE QUITE PLASTIC THEY ARE MENABLE TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO BOTH WHAT WE THINK AND WHAT WE FEEL AS WELL AS WHAT WE DO HOWEVER ALL THREE ASPECTS THAT WERE DISCUSSING TO DAY DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT ARE ALSO STRONGLY BIOLOGICALLY DRIVEN WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS SUCH AS HORMONES BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS SUCH AS NEURO CHEMICAL THINGS LIKE DOPAMINE OXYTOSE AND INCERATONEN AND NERL CIRCUITS BRAIN AREAS AND INDEED AREAS OF THE BODY THET INTERACT WITH THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL WHETHER OR NOT WE DESIRE SOMEBODY OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT WE LOSE OR INCREASE OUR DESIRE FOR SOMEBODY OVER TIME WHETHER R NOT WE FALLIN LOVE WHAT LOVE MEANS AND WHETHE OR NOT THE RELATIONSHIPS WE FORM CONTINUE TO INCLUDE THE ELEMENTS OF DESIRE IN LOVE OVER TIME OR NOT IN NO DER TO ILLUSTRATE JUST HOW POWERFULLY OUR BIOLOGY CAN SHAPE OUR PERCEPTION OF THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OF THEIR PEOPLE I WONT A SHARE WITHYOU THE RESULTS OF A COUPLE OF STUDIES BOTH STUDIES EXPLORE HOW PEOPLE RATE OTHER PEOPLE'S ATTRACTIVENESS AND IN BOTH STUDIES THE MAJOR VARIABLE IS THAT WOMEN ARE AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE NOW IN THE FIRST STUDIE MEN ARE RATING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF WOMEN ACCORDING TO THE SMELL OF THOSE WOMEN NOW THEIRE NOT SMELLING THEM DIRECTLY THERE SMELLING CLOTHING THAT WOMEN WAR FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AT DIFFERENT PHASES OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT MEN WILL RATE THE ODORS OF WOMEN AS MOST ATTRACTIVE IF THOSE WOMEN WORE THOSH SHIRTS THAT CLOTHING IN THE PREOBULATORY PHASE OF THEIR CYCLE SO THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT MEN DO NOT FIND WOMEN ATTRACTIVE AT OTHER STAGES OF THEIR CYCLE IT IS TO SAY THAT MEN FIND WOMEN'S ODORS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE IF THOSE ODORS WERE WORN BY WOMEN THAT ARE IN THE PREOBULATORY PHASE OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE NOW THERE WIS ALSO A STUDY THAT WAS DONE WHERE WOMEN AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE ARE RATING THE ODORS OF MEN AND A SIMILAR BUT MIRROR SYMMETRIC RESULT WAS FOUND SUCH THAT WOMEN WHO ARE IN THE PREOBULATORY PHASE OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE WILL RATE MEN'S ODORS AS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN AT OTHER STAGES OF THEIR CYCLE SO THE SIMPLE WAY TO PUT THIS IS THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE PREOBULATORY PHASE OF A WOMEN'S MENSTRUAL CYCLE THAT MAKES MEN RATE THEM AS MORE ATTRACTIVE DURING THAT TIME AND WOMEN RATE MEN AS MORE ATTRACTIVE DURING THAT PARTICULARIR TIME AS WELL SO THIS IS A BY DIRECTIONAL EFFACT THE WAY THAT THE SECOND STUDY WAS DONE WHERE WOMEN ARE RATING MEN WAS NOT JIOUST TO SMELL THE ODORS OF THOSE MEN ON TEA SHIRTS THEY DID THAT BUT THEY CORRELATED THAT WITH WHETHER OR NOT THE SHIRTS WERE WORN BY MEN THAT WERE PARTICULARLY PHYSICALLY SYMMETRICAL THAT SHE HAD THESE MEN DIVIDED INTO GROUPS IT AS MORE OF A CONTINUUM RATHER RATED ACCORDING TO BODY SYMMETRY AND FACE SYMMETRY AND WOMEN PREFERRED MORE SYMMETRICAL MEN WHEN THEY WERE DOING THE PREFERENCE TEST DURING THE PREOULATORY PHASE OF THEIR CYCLE SO AGAIN THE POINT IS THAT THAT PREOBULATORY PHASE THE CYCLE SEEMS TO CREATE A BY DIRECTIONAL MUTUAL ATTRACTIVENESS NOW ALSO EXTREMELY INTERESTING IS THAT THIS EFFECT DOES REALLY SEEM TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH OPULATION BECAUSE IN BOTH STUDIES THEY HAD WOMEN THAT WERE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTION OR NOT AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS IF A WOMEN IS TAKING ORAL CONTRAEPTION IT PREVENTED THAT PIQUE IN PERCEIVED ATTRACTIVENESS BY THE MEN MEANING MEN NO LONGER PERCEIVED OF WOMEN TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE AT HE PARTICULAR PHASE OF THEIR CYCLE AND ALSO WOMEN TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTION NO LONGER PREFERR THE ODORS OF MORE SURMETRICAL MEN DURING THE PROBULATORY PHASE OF THEIR CYCLE NOW I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ITS ESPECIALLY CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT ORAL CONTRA EPTION REDUCED THE PERCEPTION OF A WOMAN AS ATTRACTIVE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN IN THESE STUDIES IT REDUCED THE FURTHER INCREASE IN A MALE'S PERCEPTION OF HER AS ATTRACTIVE AND IF WOMEN TOOK ORAL CONTRACEPTION IT PREVENTED THEM FROM PREFERRING MORE SOME METRICAL MEN BASED ON THE ODORS OF THOSE MEN NOW REALIZE THEIR A LOT OF VARIABLES HERE WE'VE GOT ODORS WE'VE GOT CYMETRY WE'VE GOT MENSTRAL CYCL PREOVILATORY NONPREOVLATORY AND WE HAVE A WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE TAKING CONTRACEPTION OR NOT BUT THE BASIC FINDING IS THAT DEPENDING ON WHERE WOMEN ARE IN THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCL INFLUENCES BOTH MEN'S PERCEPTION OF THEM AS ATTRACTIVE AND THEIR PERCEPTION OF MEN AS ATTRACTIVE AN ORAL CONTRARCEPTION ELIMINATES THAT OF FACT SO I SHARE WITH YOU THOSE DATA TO ILLUSTRATE THAT WE OFTEN THINK THAT SOMEBODY IS ATTRACTIVE OR NOT BASED ON HOW THEY LOOK A THEIR SKIN THEIR HAIR ET CETER BUT IT ALSO ILLUSTRATES THAT THEIR ODOR IS A POWERFUL CUE FOR SOME PEOPLE MORE THAN OTHERS KNOW SOME OF US TEN TO BE MORAL FACTORY DRIVEN THAN OTHERS ALTHOUGH IF YOU WATCHED THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST EPISODE THAT I DID WITH PROFESSOR DAVID BUSS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTIN WHOSE A LUMINARY IN THE FIELD OF EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY AND HAS STUDIED MATE CHOICE AND MAKE SELECTION BIAS OVER DECADES HE'S REALLY ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THAT FIELD HE EMPHASIZED FINDINGS THAT ODOR FOR MANY PEOPLE IS A MAKER OR A DEAL BREAKER A MEANING THERE RE SOME PEOPLE THAT EVEN IF SOMEBODY HAS ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT THEYR LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF KINDNESS AND ATTRACTIVENESS AND VALUES AND OTHER FEATURES THAT WOULD WOULD AN SHOULD BE OF VERY HIGH PRIORITY IN SELECTING A MATE THAT IF THEY IF SOMEONE DOES NOT LIKE THE WAY THAT PERSON SMELLS THERE INNATE BODY ODOR INDEPENDENT OF COLOGNES AND PERFUMES IN SOAPS ET CETERA AND THAT THAT'S OFTEN AT COMPLETE IN TOTAL DEAL BREAKER I'M SURE THERE SOME OF YOU THAT CAN RELATE TO THAT AN THEIR SOME OF YOU IM PERHAPS FOR WHICH THAT IS NOT THE CASE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THAT BEING SUCH A POWERFUL VARIABLE AND YET THE DATA SUGGEST THED INDEED IT IS A POWERFUL VARIABLE FOR MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIREAN EFFORTS TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE IN SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS

ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOV WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOT CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'L GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT OF COURSE THESE ARE TOPICS THAT GRAB TREMENDOUS INTEREST SO IT'S WORTH US DEFINING OUR TERMS A LITTLE BIT BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER OF COURSE WE CAN HAVE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF LOVES THERE'S ROMANTIC LOVE THERE'S LOVE OF FAMILY SO CALL FAMILIAR LOVE THERE'S LOVE OF PETS WE CAN EVEN LOVE OBJECTS WHERE WE CAN FEEL AS IF WE LOVE OBJECTS WE CAN LOVE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES WE CAN HAVE FRIENDS THAT WE LOVE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THE WORD LOVE IS USED TO ENCOMPASS A LOT OF DIFFERENT KYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS TO DAY WE ARE MAINLY GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON ROMANTIC LOVE AND THE NURAL MECHANISMS OF ROMANTIC LOVE I WANT ACKNOWLEDGE HERE AT THE OUTSET THAT MOST OF THE STUDIES OF ROMANTIC LOVE HAVE FOCUSED ON MONOGAMIUS HETEROSECUAL LOVE AND ALSO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STUDIES FOCUSED ON DESIRE AND ATTRACTIVENESS AND ATTACHMENT THAT'S ALSO THE CASE AND THAT SIMPLY REFLECTS THE GENERAL BIUS OF THE LITERATURE OVER THE LAST FIFTY TO HUNDRED YEARS IT DOES OF COURSE NOT RULE OUT THAT SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT MECHANISMS COULD BE AT PLAY IN NONMONOGAMIUS RELATIONSHIPS IN HOMOSECUAL RELATIONSHIPS OR IN RELATIONSH PS OF ANY KIND OR VARIATION IT'S ALSO WORTH US DEFINING OUR TERMS AROUND DESIRE IT CAN MEAN LUST IT CAN MEAN THE DESIRE FOR LONGTRM PARTNERSHIP SO WE NEED TO DEFINE OUR TERMS AND THROUGHOUT I WILL DO MY BEST TO VERY CAREFULLY DEFINE WHAT I MEAN BY DESIRE WHAT I MEAN BY LOVE AND WHAT I MEAN BY ATTACHMENT THE FORMAL STUDY OF LOVE AND DESIRE AND ATTACHMENT GOES BACK TO THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS ONE OF THE CLASSIC STUDIES ON THIS IS ENTITLED LOVE AND DESIRE IT WAS PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN TWELVE AND REALLY FOCUSET ON TO OPPOSING THEMES WITHIN ROMANCE ONE IS LOVE WHICH IN THAT PAPER WAS REALLY MEANT TO INCLUDE ATTACHMENT AND DEPENDENCE OR INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS MINHT AND THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM BEING DESIRE OR THE SEXUAL DESIRE FOR ANOTHER AND ROMANCE WAS MEANT TO INCAPSILATE BOTH THOSE THINGS LOVE AND DESIRE AND FOR MUCH OF THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS IT WAS THOUGHT THAT LOVE AND DESIRE WERE ON SORT OF OPPOSING ENDS ARE IN KIND OF OPPUSHPOLL AND IT WAS THE DYNAMIC PUSHIAN POLL BETWEEN LOVE AND AND DESIRE THAT ONE COULD DEFINE ROMANCE AND THAT ACTUALLY LED TO MUCH OF WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE TODAY WE ARE GOING TO EXPLORE SOME NEUROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES SOME STUDIES OF THE INDICRAN SYSTEMNING THE FORMON SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORT THAT GENERAL MODEL AND I'LL POINT YOU TOWARD A WHAT I THINK IS AF VERY USEFUL BOOK IN THINKING ABOUT HOW RELATIONSHIPS CAN BOTH FORM AND LAST OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HOW THOSE RELATIONSHIPS CAN INCLUDE BOTH DESIRE AND INTERDEPENDENTS I'LL ALSO TALK ABOUT SOME STUDIES THAT IF REALLY FOCUSSED ON WY RELATIONSHIPS SUCCEED AND WHY THEY FAIL AND HOW THAT RELATES TO WHETHER R NOT THERE IS SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF ATTACHMENT AND DESIRE SO TODEY WORKANT IRE BY THE SCIENCE AND INDEED YOU'LL ALSO GET SOME TOOLS THOSE TOOLS SHOULD BE USEFUL TO YOU WHETHER NOT YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP OR NOT WHETHER NOT YOUR SEEKING OUR RELATIONSHIP OR NOT I LIKE TO BEGIN WITH AN ANECDOTE AND THIS IS NOT AN ANECDOTE ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP HISTORY IT'S A ANECDOTE ABOUT MY SCIENTIFIC HISTORY WHEN I STARTD GRADUATE SCHOOL THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN AT THE TIME SAID TO ME YOU KNOW MOST P H DS LAST LONGER THAN MOST MARRIAGES AND INDEED HE WAS RIGHT AND ALSO MOST MARRIAGES IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN DIVORCE I THINK IT'S ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT WITH A SLIGHT SKEW TOWARD MORE ENDING IN DIVORCE THAN ON PERSIST UNTIL DEATH DO THEM PART BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S ABOUT HALF AND MOST MARRIAGES END BEFORE THE EIGHT YEAR PERIOD ES UP MOST P HS TAKE ANYWHERE FROM FORE TO NINE YEARS SO THOSE A BIT OF A SMEERING OF AVERAGES THERE BUT THE POIN HE WAS TRYIN TO MAKE REALLY LANDED HOME FOR ME ON IT DID NOT SCARE ME OF OUT OF A RELATIONSHIPS N ORTAT ITS CAREME OUT OF A PD OBVIOUSLY WHAT IT DID ILLUSTRATE WAS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT OUR ATTACHMENT MACHINERY THAT CAN BE VERY VERY COMPELLING SUCH THAT PEOPLE TAKE ON TREMENDOUS LEVELS OF COMMITMENT I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT MOST PEOPLE ENTERMARRIAGES ASSUMING THAT THERE CAN STAY IN THOSE MARRIAGES I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE ENTER MARRIAGES THINKING THEIR GOING TO GET DIVORCE BUT THAT IF FIFTY PER CENT OF THOSE COMMITMENTS AND IN DIVORCE THERE MUST ALSO BE MECHANISMS BY WHICH OUR ATTACHMENTS CAN BREAK D TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BOTH THE FORMING OF ATTACHMENTS AND THE BREAKING OF ATTACHMENTS WHAT CAN PREVENT THOSE BREAKS IND ATTACHMENTS AND INDEED WHAT CAN LEAD TO REATTACHMENTS THERE ORE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS TO DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT THAT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR NOW THERE IS A ROBUST AND VERY LARGE LITERATURE IN ANIMAL MODELS WHEN I MEAN BY THAT ARE FIELD STUDIES AND LABORATORY STUDIES IN PRIMATES OF DIFFERENT KINDS SUCH AS MACAC MONKEYS OR BONOBOS O PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT THESE SORTS OF THINGS BELIEVE REN NOT IN DUCKS IN LABORATORY MICE IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIRDS ET CETERA AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT LITERATURE YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY FIND BIOLOGICOL EXAMPLES IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM FOR JUST ABOUT ANY BEHAVIOR THAT YOU CAN EASILY MAP TO HUMAN BEHAVIOR SO FOR INSTANCE A THERE'S A SPECIES OF ANIMAL CALLED THE PRAIRIE VOLL IN ONE PORTION OF THE UNITED STATES THIS PRAIRIE VOL SPECIES IS MONOGYMIS THEY ONLY MATE WITH ONE OTHER PRAIRIE VOLL ONLY RAISE YOUNG WITH ONE OTHER PRAIRIE VOLL FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AND IN ANOTHER REGION OF THE UNITED STATES THE SAME SPECIES OF ANIMAL THE PRAIRIE VOLL WILL MATE WITH MANY INDIVIDUALS THEIR NONMONOGYMOUS AND THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE AT LEAST AS FAR AS WE KNOW BETWEEN THE PRAIRIE VOLS IN ONE LOCATION ANOTHER LOCATION IS THE LEVELS OF A MOLECULE CALLED VES OPPRESSIN IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THESIPRESSIN IS PRESENT IN HUMANS IT HAS NUMEROUS BIOLOGICAL ROLES ITS N RESPONSIBLE FOR INSTANCE FOR CONTROLLING THE AMOUNT OF URINE THAT YOU AD SCREET THE MOUNT OF WATER THAT YOU RETAIN AND FOR SECTUAL DESIRE AS WELL AS O MATE SEEKING LEVELS OF THESE OPPRESSIN IN PRAIRIE VOLS ARE STRONGLY DETERMINANT OF WHETHER NOT A PRAIRIE VOLL IS GOING TO BE MONOGYMOUS OR NONMONOGYMOUS WHY DO I RAISE THIS WELL I RAISE THIS BECAUSE THE LITERATURE ON PRAIRIE VOLLS IS QUITE BEAUTIFUL AND HAS BEEN DISCUSSD QUITE A LOT IN THE POPULAR PRESS YOU CAN LOOK IT UP WITHIN EASY EASILY JUST OF WEBEGE IN SEARCH YOU'LL FIND LOTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS LOTS OF NEWS ARTICLES ABOUT THIS AND LOTS OF INTERPRETATIONS AS TO HOW VES OPPRESSIN MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN SIMILAR R DIFFERENT MECHANISMS AND HUMANS NOW I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MAPPING ANIMAL STUDIES TO HUMANS I THINK THEIR CERTAINLY A PLACE FOR THAT BUT IF YOU JUST SORT OF LEAN BACK AND LOOC AT THE GIANT MASS OF STUDIES AND ANIMALS AND THEIR A BEMATING BEHAVIOR IN THERE MATE SELECTION BEHAVIOR YOU CAN ESSENCIALLY FINE EXAMPLES OF ANYTHING YOU CAN FIND EXAMPLES OF A POLYGAMY CAN FIN EXAMPLES OF ON CHEATING YOU KNOW OF INFIDELITY YOU CAN FIND EXAMPLES OF ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS THAT IN YOUR OWN MIND YOU CAN MAP TO HUMAN BEHAVIOR BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO MAKE THE LEAP FROM ANIMAL MODELS TO HUMANS IN ANY KIND OF DIRECT WAY AND SO THANKFULLY THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS WORK DONE IN THE LAST MAINLY TWENTY YEARS OR SO LOOKING AT HUMAN MATE SELECTION HUMAN DESIRE HUMAN LOVE AND HUMAN ATTACHMENT SO WERE MAINLAGUEN E FOCUS ON THOSE STUDIES TODAY AND WER APPROPRIATE WE WILL MAP THOSE FINDINGS BACK TO THE FINDINGS AND ANIMALS TO SEE IF THERE ARE SOME UNIVERSAL TRUTHS OR SOME UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES ABOUT HOW THE NORL CIRCUITS AND BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM'S WORK BUT BY LARGE WORGAN A FOCUS ON HUMAN STUDIES TODAY SO UNLESS I SAY OTHERWISE THE DATOF THEM REFERRING TO TO DAY ARE ENTIRELY FROM HUMAN BEINGS SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ATTACHMENT AND ATTACHMENT STYLES AND THIS WILL OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR YOURSELF SUCH AS WHAT IS MY MEANING YOUR ATTACHMENT STYLE IN RELATIONSHIP ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST FINDINGS IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY IS THIS NOTION OF ATTACHMENT STYLES AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCOVERED THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL SET OF STUDIES THAT WERE DONE BY MARYAINSWORTH IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN WHICH SHE DEVELOPED A LABORATORY CONDITION CALLED THE STRANGE SITUATION TASK NOW THE STRANGE SITUATION TASK HAS BEEN STUDIED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN DIFFERENT CULTURES IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IN PREPARING FOR THIS EPISODE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THREE DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGISTS I SPOKE TO A PSYCHOANALIST I SPOKE TO A COGNA BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGIS AND ACT SHE SPOKE TO A PSYCHIATRIST USE ME NOT PSYCHOLOGES BUT A PSYCHIATRIS WITH A MEDICAL DEGREE AND ASK IS THE STRANGE SITUATION TASK AND THE VARIOUS ATTACHMENT STYLES THAT EMERGE FROM THAT TASK ARE THOSE STILL CONSIDERED VALID AND INDEED ALL THREE OF THEM SAID IF EVER THERE WAS A LITERATURE AND PSYCHOLOGY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TAMPED DOWN AND HAS A FIRM BASIS IN BOTH DATA AND REAL WORLD PRINCIPLES AND REAL WORLD EXAMPLES ITS THIS NOTION OF ATTACHMENT STYLES TO WHAT IS THE STRANGE SITUATION TASK THE STRANGE SITUATION TASK INVOLVES A PARENT TYPICALLY A MOTHER IN THE STUDIES THAT WERE DONE BUT A PARENT OR OTHER CARE GIVER BRINGING THEIR CHILD THEIR ACTUAL CHILD INTO LABORATORY AND THERE'S A ROOM WITH A STRANGER AND THE MOTHER ENTERS THE ROOM WITH THE CHILD AND THERE SOME TOYS IN THE ROOM AND TYPICALLY THE MOTHER AND THE STRANGER WILL TALK I VE SEE THE STRANGER IS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT IS NOT TOSOM RANDOMPERSO OFF THE STREET AND THE CHILD IS ALLOWED TO MOVE ABOUT THE ROOM THEY CAN OBSERVE THE MOTHER INTERACTING WITH THE OTHER PERSON OR NOT THEY CAN PLAY WITH TOYS OR NOT BUT THEN AT SOME POINT THE MOTHER LEAVES AND THEN AT SOME POINT LATER DESIGNATED BY THE EXPERIMENTOR THE MOTHER COMES BACK AND WHAT IS MEASURED IN THESE STUDIES IS BOTH HOW THE CHILD THE TODLER REACTS TO THE MOTHER LEAVING AND HOW THE CHILD REACTS TO THE MOTHER RETURNING AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT AND AFTENTIMES THIS WILL HAVE TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT PHASES WHERE THE MOTHER WILL BRING THE CHILD IN THEN LEAVE THEN COME BACK IN AND LEAVE THERE ARE ALSO STUDIES IN WHICH THE BEHAVIOR OF THE CHILD WITH THE STRANGER IS ALSO EXAMINED SO THER LOT OF VARIATIONS OF THIS BUT THE BASIC FINDINGS OR THAT TODDLER'S CHILDREN FALL INTO FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF ATTACHMENT STYLE AND THAT THESE ATTACHMENT STYLES CAN PREDICT MANY FEATURES OF ADOLESCENT TEEN YOUNG ADULT AND EVEN ADULT ATTACHMENT STYLES NOT IN STRANGE SITUATIONS OF THE SORT THAT I JUST DESCRIBED BUT IN ROMANTIC ATTACHMENTS I SHOULD MENTION ALSO THAT ATTACHMENT STYLE IS PLASTIC MEANING IT CAN CHANGE ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN SO AS I DESCRIBE THE RESULTS I DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENT  ATTACHMENT STYLES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND IF ANY OF THOSE RESINATE WITH YOU OR ON BRING TO MIND CERTAIN PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE PLEASE DO NOT ASSUME THAT THOSE ATTACHMENT STYLES ARE RIGID AND FIXED FOR TE ENTIRE LIFE SPAND THERE ARE ALSO TERRIFIC DATA THAT INDICATE THAT THROUGH SPECIFIC PROCESSES BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOME BIOLOGICAL A ADJUSTMENTS THAT PEOPLE CAN CHANGE THEIR ATTACHMENT STYLE AND THAT INDEED PEOPLE W HAVE DIFFERENT ATTACHMENT STYLES CAN CHANGE THE ATTACHMENT TYLES OF OTHERS BUT JUST TO MAKE VERY CLEAR WHAT THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY WERE I WANT A REVIEW WHAT THE FOUR DIFFERENT ATTACHMENT STYLES ARE AND TYPICALLY PEOPLE FALL INTO ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER BUT NOT SEVERAL SO THE FOUR PATTERNS OF ATTACHMENT THAT WERE REVEALED BY THESE STUDIES AGAIN WERE REVEALED BY EXAMINING THE BEHAVIOR OF THE CHILD IN RESPONSE TO THE MOTHER LEAVING THE AND THE MOTHER RETURNING AND THE CHILD'S RESPONSE TO THE STRANGER THAT IS IN THE ROM WITH THEM THE FIRST STYLE IS THE SO CALLED SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE IN THE NOMINCLATURE OF THIS KIND OF A STUDY THESE ARE THE SO CLLED B BABIES AS IN THE LETTER BE BULDOG BE NOT FOR BULDOGS BUT JUST TO DESIGNATE THIS TATEGORY THE SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE IS ONE IN WHICH THE CHILD WILL ENGAGE WITH THE STRANGER WITH THE EXPERIMENTER WHILE THE PARENT IS PRESENT IN THE ROOM BUT THAT WHEN THE PARENT TYPICALLY S A MOTHER BUT WHEN THE PARENT OR OTHER CARE GIVERELEAVES THE CHILD DOES GET VISIBLY UPSET THEY MIGHT WHINE THEY MIGHT CRY THEY MIGHT EVEN TANTFROM A BIT HOWEVER WHEN THE CAREGIVER MEANING THE MOTHER OR FATHER OR OTHER CAREGIVER RETURNS THE CHILD VISIBLY EXPRESSES HAPPINESS THAT THE CAREGIVER HAS RETURNED  SO THAT'S THE HALL MARK OF THE SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE AND AGAIN THIS IS ALL PREVERBLE THIS IS HAPPENING LONG BEFORE THE CHILE CAN EXPRESS HOW THEY FEEL WITH WORDS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS IS THAT THE SECURE CHIYLE FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THE CARE GIVER IS AVAILABLE AND WILL R E RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR COMMUNICATIONS SO THAT WHEN THE CHILD WINES AND ORS YOU KNOW DISTRESSED THE PARENT DOESN'T COME RIGHT BACK INTO THE ROOM BUT AT SOME POINT THEY DO AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE A SENSE OF TRUST THAT IF THE PARENT OR CARE GIVE RELIEVES THAT THA PARENT WILL COME BACK AND THAT THEIR HAPPY THAT THEY DO THESE CHILDREN ARE ALSO VERY GOOD AT EXPLORING NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS AFTER THE PARENT IS GONE AND WHILE THE PARENT IS THERE AND ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN THE PARENT IS THERE THEY WILL EXPLORE MORE BROADLY LITERALLY IN SPACE THEY'LL THEY'LL VENTURE OUT FURTHER THAN THEY WILL WHEN THE PARENT IS GONE THEY ALSO TEND TO ENGAGE WITH THE CAREGIVER IN A WAY THAT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLETELY TRUSTING BUT THAT OVER TIME SEEMS TO AVOLVE FROM ONE IN WHICH THEIR KIND OF SUSPICIOUS OF THIS PERSON TO ONE IN WHICH THEY ARE AT LEAST SOMEWHAT TRUSTING OCASE TO THESE ARE THE GENERAL CONTOURS OF THE SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE AND FORTUNATELY NOWADAYS THERE ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES MEASURING THINGS LIKE HEART RATED AND BREATHING AND OTHER MEASURES THAT CORRELAT WITH THE A SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMEN ON WHAT THESE CHILDREN ARE FEELING O KESS THE FIRST CATEGORY IS SECURE ATTACHED THE SECOND CATEGORY IS THE SO CALLED ANXIOUS AVOIDANT OR INSECURELY ATTACHED WHICH ARE THE CATEGORY A A BABIES THE CHA THE CHILDREN WITH ANXIOUS AVOIDIN INSECURE ATTACHMENT PATTERNS AM GENERALLY TEND TO AVOID OR IGNORE THE CAREGIVER I MEANING THE PARENT AM AND SHOW VERY LITTLE EMOTION WHEN THE PARENT LEAVES OR RETURENTS SO THIS IS THE REASON THEY CALL THEM AVOIDANT OR ANXIOUS AVOID IN IN KIND INSECURE THERE ISN'T THIS HAPPINESS OR JOID THAT THE PARENT IS BACK THEY DON'T SEEM TO EXPRESS THAT THEY DO NOT EXHIBIT DISTRESS ON SEPARATION AND THEY GENERALLY TEND TO HAVE AM SOME TENDENCY TO APPROACH THAT THE THE CAREGIVER WHEN THEY RETURN BUT BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN A GENERAL EXPRESSION OF JOY AND AGAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES SUPPORT THAT IS WELL THINGS LIKE CHANGES IN HEART RATE TEND TO BE LESS DRAMATIC IN THE ANXIOUS AVOID ANT INSECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE THAN IN THE SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE S THAT'STHE SECOND ONE THE THIRD CATEGORY IS THE SO CALLED ANXIOUS AM BIVOLENT SLASH RESISTANT INSECURE CATEGORY I DIDN'T NAME THESE CATEGORYE SO VE TO BLAME OTHERS A IN THIS ONE INSTANCE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE BLAME ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE YOU HAVE TO VLAME O THE PSYCHOLOGISTS THAT THAT NAME THIS CATEGORY THE ANXIOUS EMBIVLENT SLASH RESISTANT INSECURE CATEGORY ALSO CLLED THE SEA BABIES FOR THE LETTER SEE JUST A A CATEGORIZATION THE ANXIOUS EMBIVOLENT RESISTANT INSECURE TODDLERS REALLY SHOW DISTRESS EVEN BEFORE SEPARATION FROM THEIR MOTHER OR OTHER CAREGIVER AND THEY TEND TO BE VERY CLINGY AND DIFFICULT TO COMFORT WHEN THE CAREGIVER RETURNS CAYSO THEIR DISTRESS EVEN BEFORE THE MOTHER LEAVES THE ROOM AND THEY CAN BE VERY CLINGING AND REALLY HARD TO CALM DOWN WHEN THE MOTHER RETURNS THEY TEND TO SHOW EITHER WHAT SEEMS O BE RESENTMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE PARENTS ABSENCE WE DON'T REALLY KNO WHAT THEIR FEELING OR SOME SORT OF HELPLESS PASSIVITY AND THERE'S ACTUALLY SUBCATEGORIZATIONS THOF THE PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE COME UP WITH WITH SEE ONE SUBTYPES AND SEE TWO SOBETIMES WE DON'T HAVETO GET BOGGD DOWN IN THAT BUT JUST KNOW THAT THERE ISN'T ONE ABSOLUTE MEASURE A THAT SAYS O OF THIS  PERSON IS ANXIOUS AMBIVOLENT RESISTENT IN SECURE THEY COULD BE SOMEWHAT PASSIVE A OR THEY COULD BE A SEEM SOMEWHAT ANGRY AT THE CAREGIVER BUT THE BASIC IDEAS THAT BEFORE AND AFTER THE SEPARATION THEY ARE CLINGI AND DIFFICULT TO COMFORT THEY JUST CAN'T SEEM TO CALLM THEMSELVES DOWN AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES OF HEART RATE AND HORMONE MEASUREMENTS SUCH AS CORTIS ALL ALSO SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT AND THE THIRD CATEGORY OF ATTACHMENT STYLE IS THE SO CALLED DISORGANIZED OR DISORIENTED OR D FOR THE LETTER DE A BABIES THIS IS A CATEGRIZATION THAT WAS ADDED LATER TO THIS STRANGE SITUATION TASK THAT IS A REAL HALMARK OF DEVELOPMENT O A PSYCHOLOGY STUDIES IT WAS DEVELOPED BY A MARYAINS WORTH GRADUATE STUDENT A MERRY MAINE WHO ACTUALLYHAVE THE GREAT FORTUNE OF OF TAKING COURSE FROM IN LEARNING FROM WHEN I WAS A GRADUATES UNIBERKLY A MANY YEARS AGO AND THIS FOURTH CATEGRIZATION WAS CONTROVERSIAL FOR A WHILE BUT NOW IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THE KEE FEATURE OF THE DISORGANIZED DISORIENTED CATEGORY IS THAT THE TODDLERS TEND TO BE TENSE AND THEY TENTED INCOMPISSILOT OF A KIND O ODD PHYSICAL POSTURES THEY TEND TO HUNCH THEIR SHOULDERS A THOUGH PUT THEIR HANDS BEHIND THEIR NECK THEY'LL UMCOCK THEIR HEAD TO THE SIDE A FOR THOSE O YOU LISTENING A DOING THIS ON THE VIDIO VERSION IT'S NOT A WORK YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO SEE THAT BUT I FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE WATCHING THE ONVIDIO A THEY TEND A CIND OF CONSTRAIN THEIR THEIR BODY SIZE A BIT AND GOING TO ODD POSTURES THAT THEY NORMALLY WOULDN'T A DO ANYWHERE ELS A  SO THIS IS WY ITES CALLED THE DISORGANIZE OR DISORIENTED A CATEGORY IT SEEMS LIKE THESE CHILDREN JUST DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO REACT TO A SEPARATION AND THEY JUST A START TO MANIFEST BEHAVIORS AND EMOTIONAL TONES THAT AREN'T OBSERVED IN OTHER SITUATIONS O CASE WE'VE GOT OUR FOUR CATEGORIES I'LL TRY AND USE THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE NAMES FOR EACH CATEGORY WE'VE GOT CATEGORY ONE WHICH IS SECURELY ATTACHED WE'VE GOT CATEGORY TO WHICH IS INSECURELY ATTACHED ALSO SOMETIMES CALLED ANXIOUS AVOIDANT THEN WE'VE GOT CATEGORY THREE WHICH IS THE RESISTANT INSECURE CATEGORY WHICH IS ANXIOUS AMBIVILENT AND THEN THERE'S THIS FOURTH CATEGORY THE DISORGANIZED DISORIENTED CATEGORY OR THE SO CALLED D BABIES NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT IS THAT THE CATEGORIZATIONS OF CHILDREN INTO ONE OF THESE FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AS TODTLERS IS STRONGLY PREDICTIVE OF THEIR ATTACHMENT STYLE IN ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIPS LATER IN LIFE WHICH IS TO ME BOTH AMAZING AND SURPRISING AND NOT SURPRISING ALL AT THE SAME TIME AMAZING BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT A FIR S OF ALL WE ARE RELATIVELY HARD WIRED FOR ATTACHMENT I THINK THAT THATS INCREDIBLE AND BEAUTIFUL THAT WE HAVE DESIGNATED NURON'S NERVE CELLS AND HORMONAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE THERE TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE SOME SORT OF RESPONSE TO A CARE GIVER BEING THERE OR NOT BEING THERE OR RETURNING OR LEAVING BUT ALSO THAT THE SAME NOURAL CIRCUITRIES THE SAME HORMONAL RESPONSES ARE AT LEAST IN SOME WAY REPURPOSED FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ATTACHMENTS LATER IN LIFE SO WHEN WE HEAR THE PSYCHOLOGISTS A TALK ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WE FORMED A TEMPLET EARLY IN LIFE BASED ON EXPERIENCES THAT WERE EVEN PREVERBAL BEFORE WE HAD LANGUAGE AND THOSE TEMPLETS ARE SUPERIMPOSED ON OUR RELATIONSHIPS OR IF WE SHOULD SAY AUR LATER RELATIONSHIPS ARE SUPERIMPOSED ON THOSE TEMPLETS THERE REALLY IS A BASIS FOR THAT WE NOW HAVE NORROW IMAGING STUDIES TO SUPPORT FOR INSTANCE THE WORK OF OF OWLIN SURE FROM YOUSELE SHOWING THAT WHEN A MOTHER AND CHILD INTERACT EITHER THROUGH VERY SOOTHING INTERACTIONS LIKE BOTTLE FEEDING OR BREASTFEEDING OR SINGING TO ONE'S BABY OR PUTTING THEM TO SLEEP THAT THE BRAIN OF THE CHILD AND THE BRAIN OF THE MOTHER ARE ENTERING A CORDINATED STATE OF RELAXATION AND IT'S NOT ONE DIRECTION MOTHER TO CHILD THE CHILD IS ALSO CALMING THE MOTHER TYPICALLY THESE STUDIES WERE DONE WITH MOTHERS AGAINST SOMETIMES WITH FATHERS BUT TYPICALLY WITH MOTHERS AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WHEN THE MOTHER OR OTHER CAREGIVER ACTS VERY EXCITED AND RAISES THE THEIR VOICE OR PUT TO LILT AND THEIR VOICE OR WIDENS THEIR EYES THAT THE CHILD WILL DO THE SAME AND AGAIN THERE'S A BY DIRECTIONAL INTERACTION IN THAT CASE OF EXCITEMENT AND THERE'S THE RELEASE OF NERCHEMICALS LIKE DOPOMINE INTO THE BLOOD STREMWHEREAS IN THE RELAXATION SENAREO AND THE SOOTHING SENERA THERS WE KNOW THE THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE SERATONAN AND OXYTOSEN SO THE NOURAL SYSTEMS FOR ATTACHMENT AND THE NOURAL SYSTEMS FOR WHAT WE CALL AUTONOMIC AROUSAL FOR BEING ALERT AND CALM DON'T ACT IN A VACUM THEY ARE TETHERED TO OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THIS RIGHT WE SOMETIMES HEAR THE STATEMENT NO ONE CAN MAKE YOU FEEL ANYTHING I'VE ALWAYS OUTLEBIT OF A PROBLEM WITH THAT STATEMENT A I DON'T THINK I'M A CONTRADICTING ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR BUT YOU HEAR THAT A LOT NO ONE CAN MAKE YOU FEEL ANYTHING INDEED THEY CAN RIGHT THE PHYSICAL INJURY CAN MAKE YOU FEEL SOMETHING AM IF SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING THAT YOU VERY MUCH LIKE IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL SOMETHING AND IF SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING THAT YOU VERY MUCH DISLIKE IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL SOMETHING SO THE IDEA THAT NO ONE CAN MAKE US FEEL ANYTHING ISN'T ACTUALLY TRUE OR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS TETHERED TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS OF OTHERS AND THAT IS TRUE FROM THE VERY EARLIEST STAGES OF OUR LIVES ND IN THIS CASE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW ARE TEMPLETS FOR ATTACHMENT IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS HOW WE FIND THEM HOW WE MAINTAIN THEM AND INDEED HOW WE BREAK THEM IN REFORM THEM IS BASED ON A TEMPLET THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF PRIORITIES WHICH WAS HOW WE FEEL SAFE AND SECURE IN NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT OUR PRIMARY CAREGIVER IS THERE OR NOT NEURO IMAGING SUPPORTS THAT WHEN I SAY NOR IMAGING I MEAN BRAINSCAND SUPPORT THAT MEASURES OF HORMONES IN THE BODY AND BRAIN SUPPORT THAT MEASURES OF NEUROCHEMICAL SUPPORT THAT THERE SIMPLY NO WAY AROUND THIS TRUTH THAT WE HAVE A SET OF ROAD MAPS IN OUR MIND THAT ARE RE USED FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PURPOSES LATER IN LIFE THAT IS VITALLY IM PORTANT T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IF ONE IS SUCCESSFUL IN FORMING ROMANTIC ATTACHMENTS MAINTAINING THEM ET CETERA OR NOT DOES IN FACT REFLECT THE EARLIER TEMPLETS THAT YOU'VE CREATED BUT AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THESE TEMPLETS CAN SHIFT OVER TIME AND ONE OF THE MORE POWERFUL WAYS TO SHIFT THOSE TEMPLETS OVER TIME IS PURELY BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY EXIST END THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE TEMPLETS ARE MALIABLE THEY CAN CHANGE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF NEURO PLASTICITY AGENNERAL PLASTICITY IS JUST THE REWIRING OF NERVE CONNECTIONS THAT IS VERY MUCH PRESENT IN CHILDHOOD BUT ALSO VERY MUCH PRESENT IN ADULTHOOD SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO YOU THINK FALLS IN DECATEGORY ONE TO THREE OR FOUR OR YOU KNOW SOMEBODY OR INVOLVED WITH SOMEBODY WHO FALLS INTO CATEGORY ONE TO THREE IND FOUR THE MERE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT CAN BE VERY USEFUL BUT YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT WHAT I DO WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE WHILL FORTUNATELY BOTH PSYCHOLOGIST AND BIOLOGISTS HAVE STARTED TO LEVERAGE THAT KNOWLEDGE TOWARD ESTABLISHING BETTER MORE SECURE BONDS IN ADULT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND THERE'S A BOOK THAT HAS REALLY TAPPED INTO THIS I THINK IT'S THE FIRST BOOK THAT IS REALLY ATDRESS THIS HEAD ON AND THAT BOOK COMES FROM TO A COLUMBIA PROFESSORS A AND THE TITAL OF THE BOOK IS ATTACHED THE NEW SCIENCE OF ADULT ATTACHMENT AND HOW IT CAN HELP YOU FIND AND KEEP LOVE THAT THE AUTHORS OF THIS BOOK ARE A MERE LEVINE AND RACHAL HELLER AM AGAIN BOTH OF THEM ARE A SKILLED ACADEMICS AND RESEARCHERS WHO HAVE REALLY TAKEN THE LITERATURE THAT IT ASCRIBED ON THE STRANGE SITUATION TASK AND MAPPED IT TO ADULT ATTACHMENT STYLES AND ALSO THEY'VE MAPPED OUT WAYS THAT THEY'VE OBSERVED IN THEIR CLINICAL PRACTICE AND THAT IS LABORATORY SUPPORTED FOR FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THAT HAVE AN ANXSIOUS AND BIVOLENT OR WHAT WE CALL INSECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE OR FOR PEOPLE THAT FALL IN TO THE DISORDERGANIZED OR DISORIENTED ATTACHMENT STYLE HOW THEY CAN MODIFY THAT ATTACHMENT STYLE IN OR OUT OF RELATIONSHIPS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHAT I THINK EVERYBODY WANTS WHICH IS SECURE ATTACHMENT WHY DOES EVERYBODY WANT THAT WELL SECURE ATTACHMENT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE BOTH IN RELATIONSHIP OR IF THEY CHOOSE TO BE ON THEIR OWN OR TO BE IN RELATIONSHIP BUT PHYSICALLY SEPARATED FROM SOMEBODY ELSE OR EVEN EMOTIONALLY SEPARATED FROM SOMEBODY ELSE AND MAINTAIN WHAT WE CALL A STABLE AUTONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM THE ABILITY TO REMAIN CALM CLEAR HEADED YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT YOUARE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THAT WITH SOME SENSE OF CLARITY AND NOT EXCESSIVE DISCOMFORT SO IS THERE A GOAL IN ALL OF THIS STUFF ABOUT LOVE DESIRE AND ATTACHMENT INDEED THERE IS THE THE SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE IS THE ONE THAT LEADS TO THE MOST STABLE AND PREDICTABLE LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS PUT DIFFERENTLY BABIES TODDLERS ADOLESCENCE TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS THAT HAVE A SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO FIND IN FORM LONG TURM RELATIONSHIPS THAN ARE PEOPLE IN THE OTHER ATTATEGORS BUT PEOPLE ANOTHER CATEGORIES CAN LEARN AN EVENTUALLY MIGRATE INTO THE SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE AND I THINK THAT BOOK ATTACHED A I HAVE NO OFFILIATION TO THE AUTHORS OR OR THE BOOK ITSELF I SHOULD DISMENSION THAT A ATTACHED THE NEW SCIENCE OF ADULT DATTACHMENT AND HOW CAN HELP YOU FIND AND KEEP LOVE REALLY A IT SOUNDS VERY A POP PSYCHOLOGYESK BUT IT IS REALLY GROUNDED IN THE RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE AND THERE'S ALSO SOME INTERESTING BIOLOGY THERE ANOTHER POINT TO MAKE ABOUT ATTACHMENT STYLES IS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE AND SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH CIRCUMSTANCES WHEREBY PEOPLE WHO ARE SECURELY ATTACHED EITHER BECAUSE THEY GREW UP IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SECURE ATTACHMENT WAS CULTIVATED OR BECAUSE THEY DEVELOP THAT ON THEIR OWN CAN ALSO MIGRATE OUT OF THE SECURELY ATTACHED CATEGORY INTO INSECURELY ATTACHED OR INTO AVOIDANT TYPES OF ATTACHMENT STYLES AS TEENS OR AS YOUNG ADULTS OR AS A ADULTS OF AT ANY AGE OR ANY STAGE OF LIFE BY VIRTUE OF BEING WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS A DIFFERENT PERHAPS LESS ADAPTIVE ATTACHMENT STYLE RIGHT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU HAVE OR YOU DEVELOP A SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLE IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THAT ATTACHMENT STYLE BECAUSE IT IS POSSIBLE TO BECOME ANXIOUSLY ATTACHED EVEN IF YOU GREW UP IN A STABLE ATTACHMENT FRAMEWORK AND AGAIN THIS CAN HAPPEN AT ANY STAGE SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ATTACHMENT STYLES AND HOW THEY INFLUENCE ADULT ROMANTIC ATTACHMENTS AND CERTAINLY IF YOU ARE APPARENT A I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT A THE BOOK ATTACHED AGAIN IT'S QUITE GOOD AND I THINK THAT IT OFFERS A NUMBER OF ACHMENABLE TOOLS TO BOTH FORM AND HOLD ON TO SECURE ATTACHMENT STYLES SO I MENTION THAT THE NERL CIRCUITS FOR CHILD PARENT OR CHILD CAREGIVER ATTACHMENT OR REPURPOSED FOR ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT LATER IN LIFE BUT WHAT ARE THESE N EARL CIRCUITS WHAT ARE THEY DO AIT SO ATTRACTIVE IF YOU WILL TO THINK ABOUT A BRAIN AREA THAT CONTROLS LOVE OR A BRAIN AREA THAT CONTROLS DESIRE OR A BRAIN AREA THAT CONTROLS ATTACHMENT BUT IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY AS I HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THIS PODCAS AND I WILL SAY AGAIN AND AGAIN BECAUSE IT WILL PERSIST TO BE TRUE LONG AFTER I'M GONE IS THAT NO ONE BRAIN AREA CAN GIVE RISE TO ANYTHING IS COMPLEXAS DESIRE LOVE OR ATTACHMENT INSTEAD THEIR MULTIBLE BRAIN AREAS THAT THROUGH THEIR CORDINATED ACHON CREATE A SORT OF A SONG THAT WE CALL DESIRE OR A SONG THAT WE CALL LOVE OR A SONG THAT WE CALL ATTACHMENT NOT A A LITERAL SONG ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SONGS ABOUT DESIRE LOVE IN ATTACHMENT OF COURSE MANY SONGS SOME GOOD SOME NOT SO GOOD BUT RATHER DIFF R AN BRAIN AREAS BEING ACTIVE IN DIFFERENT SEQUENCES AND WITH DIFFERENT INTENSITIES CAN MAKE US FEEL AS IF WE ARE IN THE MODE THAT WE CALL DESIRE OR IN THE MODE OF LOVE OR IN THE MODE OF ATTACHMENT BUT BENEATH ALL OF THAT IS THIS ELEMENTS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND I WANT OF FOCUS ON AUTONOMIC AROUSAL JUST FOR A BIT LONGER BECAUSE IT REALLY IS ONE OF THE THREE CORE ELEMENTS BY WHICH WE FORM AND MAINTAIN LOVING ATTACHMENTS AND BY WHICH WE BREAK LOVING ATTACHMENTS THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AS THE NAME SUGGESTS IS AUT AUTOMATIC IN FACT THAT'S WHAT AUTONOMIC MEANS NOW ITS ACTUALLY THE CASE THAT WE CAN CONTROL OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER BUT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROLS THINGS LIKE DIGESTION OUR BREATHING AH WHETHER NOT WERE CONSCIOUS OF THAT BREATHING OR NOT IT CONTROLS THINGS LIKE HOW ALERT WE ARE HOW SLEEPY WE ARE AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AS I JUST BRIEFLY DESCRIBED EARLY OR IS REALLY SOMETHIN THAT WE COME INTO THE WORLD WITH ITS HARD WIRED ALL THE ELEMENTS OR THERE BUT THROUGH INTERACTIONS WITH OUR PARENT EITHER SOOTHING INTERACTIONS OR FUN PLAYFUL INTERACTIONS OR DARE I SAY SCARY INTERACTIONS OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM GETS TUNED UP MEANING WE EACH DEVELOP A TENDENCY TO EITHER BE MORE ALERT AND ANXIOUS OR MORE CALM OR KIND OF A BALANCE OF ALERT AND CALM NOW OF COURSE IS CHANGES ACROSS EACH DAY AND DEPENDING HOW TIRED WE ARE LATE IN THE DAY IF WE'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR WHILE WE TEND TO GET SLEEPY EARLY IN THE DAY IF WERE VERY RESTED WE TEND TO WAKE UP AND FEEL VERY LERT SO THE WAY TO THING ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS A KIND OF A SEA SAW WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN BEING VERY ALERT WE CAN BE ALERT AND CALM OR WE CAN BE VERY VERY ALERT WE CAN BE IN A STATE OF PANIC WE CAN BE FAST ASLEEPS WE CAN BE EXTREMELY CALM OR WE CAN JUST BE KIND OF SLEEPY SEMICALM OM AND BUT STILL ALSO ALERT SO THE THINK ABOUT IT LIKE A SEA SAW AND THAT SEESAW HAS A A HINGE AND THAT HINGE DEFINDS HOW TIGHT OR LOOSE THAT SEASAW IS HOW READILY IT CAN TILT BACK AND FORTH OUR AUTONOMIC TONE IS HOW TIGHT THAT HINGES AND THERE ARE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS TO EXPLAIN THIS BUT HERE I JUST WANT TO STAY WITH THE ANALOGY OF THE SEASAW FOR NOW THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CHILD AND CAIRE GIVER EARLY IN LIFE TAKE THE CHILD AND THE CAIR GIVER FROM ONE END OF THE SEASAW TO THE OTHER FROM BEING VERY ALERT IN A STATE OF PLAY FOR INSTANCE TO BEING NURSED AND BEING VERY SOOTHED UNTIL WE GO TO SLEEP AND OF COURSE WECH HAVE A SEA SAW THE PARENT AND THE CHILD HAS A SEAS ON THEIR INTERACTING WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL STUDIES AND BEAUTIFUL NOT IN THE SENSE THAT HEY FOCUSED ON A PLEASANT TOPIC BUT BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE THEY WERE DONE SO BEAUTIFULLY WELL THAT LOOKED AT FOR INSTANCE THE RESPONSE OF MOTHERS AND THEIR PHYSIOLOGIES AND THE RESPONSE OF CHILDREN AND THEIR PHYSIOLOGIES DURING THE BALMING OFS ITIES DURING WORLD WORE TO SO AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION BUT WHAT WAS REVEALD DURING THE COURSE OF THESE STUDIES WAS THAT IF THE MOTHERS WERE VERY STRESSED DURING AN ONSLAUT OF BALMING OF THE CITY THE CHILDREN'S PHYSIOLOGIES TENDED TO BE STRESSED ALSO AND PERSISTED IN BEING STRESSED LONG AFTER THAT STRESSFUL EPISODE WAS DONE THE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THAT THESE CHILDREN WELL OUT FOR MANY DECADES AFTERWARDS CONVERSELY IF THE PARENT AND IN THIS CASE AGAIN IT WAS MOTHERS THAT THAT WERE EXPLORED IN THESE STUDIES HAD TURNED THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF GOING INTO THE BOM SHELTERS INTO SOMEWHAT OF A GAME RIGHT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY BUT ESSENTIALLY TELLING THE CHILDRENOKE IT'S TIME TO GO BUT NOT EXTRESSING MUCH STRESS OR DISTRESS THE CHILDREN ALSO DIDN'T DEVELOP MUCH STRESS OR DISTRESS OR TRAMA NOW THERE WERE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS OF COURSE BUT IN GENERAL THAT WAS THE RULE THAT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS OF CHILDREN TEND TOMIMIC THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS OF THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER AND THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THIS OCCURS HAS BEEN EXPLORED AND AGAIN I JUST REFERRED TO THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ALLAN SHORE AT UNIVERSIY CALIFORNIA LOSTS ANGELIS I MAND AGAIN HIS NAME IS IS SURE SPELLED S C H O R E M A LOOKING DOWN BRIEFLY AT THE FLOR HERE BECAUSE A I'LL JUST REACH FOR FOR THE BOOK YES A WONDERFUL BOOK CALLED RIGHT BRAIN PSYCHOTHERAPY IT'S A LITTLE BIT TECHNICAL BUT IF YOUR INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE STUDIES A THIS BOOKRIGHT BEDING PSYCHOTHERAPY DETAILS HOW EVERYTHING FROM NURSING OF CHILDREN TO PLAYTIME BEHAVIOR TO STRANGE SITUATION TYPE TASK BEHAVIOR WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHICH OF COURSE OCCURS WHEN CHILDREN GET DROPPED OFF AT DA CARE OR NURSERY SCHOOL ER WITH BABY SITTERS ET CETERA AND INDEED ALL TYPES OF CARE GIVER CHILD INTERACTIONS TUN UP THAT AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO THAT THE CHILD ENDS UP WITH AN AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT EITHER TENDS TO LEAN MORE TOWARDS ALERT AND ANXIOUS OR CAN BE VERY ALERT BUT CALM OR CAN BE VERY CALM AND HARD TO BUDGE AGAIN IT'S THE TIGHTNESS OF THAT HINGE THAT REALLY UNDERLIES THESE ATTACHMENT STYLES THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER AND NOT ON THIS EPISODE OF THE HUBROON LAMP POTCASTS BUT ON MANY OTHER PREVIOUS EPISODE SUCH AS THE MASTER STRESS EPISODE ER SOME OF THE AOPTOMIZE HEALTH EPISODES YOU CAN FIND THESE IF YOU WANT IT HUBERMEN LABED OUT COM A LOT OF THE TOOLS AN TECHNIQUES THAT ARE RECOMMENDED THERE HAVE TO DO WITH READJUSTING THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IN DELIVERATE WAYS AS AN ADULT AGAIN I WON'T GO INTO THE THE AM SPECIFIC TOOLS BUT FOR INSTANCE THE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH THIS A TOOL THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT EXTENSIVELY OF TWO INHALS THROUGH THE NOSE AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN ON THE FIRST ONE SNEAKING IN A LITTLE BIT MORE AIR ON THE SECOND ONE AND THEN A LONG EXHAL THROUGH THE MOUTH IS A WAY OF ADJUSTING THAT AUTONOMIC C SAW IT TENDS TO MAKE US MORE CALM IT ACTUVATES WHAT WE CALLE THE PARI SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS JUST FANCY NERVE SPEAK FOR IT'S A QUICKWAY TO CALMER SELF DOWN RIGHT THINGS LIKE ICE BAS ARE COLD SHOWERS OR COLDOMER RTION OR HYPER VENTAL DELIBERATE HYPEROVINTILATION BY CONTRAST OR WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DELIBERATELY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF OUR SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC ARM OF OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUSS TO MAKE OURSELVES MORE ALERT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT WELL YOU CAN DO THAT TO BE MORE ALERT TO BE MORE WAKE IF YOU LIKE OR AS A FORM OF SELF INDUSTRESS ANOCULATION TO BE ABLE TO TOLERATE HIGHER LEVELS OF A DRENOLINE BY MAKING IT A PRACTICE THAT YOU SELF DIRECT THE REASON THOSE TOOLS ARE OUT THERE IS BECAUSE MANY OF US FOR WHATEVER REASON NOOT TO BLAME ANY ONE BUT BECAUSE OF OUR CHILDHOOD TEMPLETS BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED AND DIDN'T HAPPEN IN TERMS OF OR INTERACTIONS WITH CARE GIVERS HAVE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS THAT ARE TILTED TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER MORE THAN WE WOULD LIKE OR IN WHICH THE HINGE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AN IN THIS ANALOGY IS TOO LOOSE OR THAT IS TOO TIGHT AND WERE SORT ARE STUCK IN A MODE OF ANXIOUSNESS ARE STUCK IN A MODE OF LACK OF ENERGY THAT'S WHAT THOSE TOOLS ARE REALLY ABOUT BUT AT A DEEPER LEVEL THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS REALLY THE SYSTEM THAT GOVERNS HOW WE WILL REACT IN RESPONSE TO A ROMANTIC PARTNER BEING PRESENT OR LEAVING AND I DON'T NECESARILY MEAN LEAVING THE RELATIONSHIP ENTIRELY ALTHOUGH IT COULD MEAN THAT RIGHT WE KNOW PEOPLE I'M SURE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT UPON THE END OF A RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY WANTED VERY MUCH ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED AND ACTUALLY IN RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE THERE A I DISCOVER THEREIS AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE FINDING THAT THE FEELINGS THAT ONE HAS AFTER A BREAK UP ARE VERY MUCH LIKE A CLLENICAL DEPRESSION IN MANY CASES BUT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN LOOK AT A BREAK UP AS A TRANSIENT EVENT THAT THEY DON'T INTERPRET AS GOING TO MEAN SO MUCH FOR ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFI OR RESHAPING THEIR VIEW OF THEMSELVES WHY WELL WE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION AND DEPENDING ON WHERE AR SEASAW IS IF YOU WILL SOME OF US BECOME EXTREMELY DISTRAUGHT AND CAN'T RECALEBRATE OURSELVES CAN'T ADJUST OURSELVES DOWN FROM IN ASTRESS TO CALM OR CAN'T TAKE OURSELVES FROM EXHAUSTED TO MORE ALERT IF WE NEED TO DO THAT ON OUR OWN AND SO THAT'S WHY TOOLS FOR DOING THAT EXIST BUT ATTACHMENT ITSELF IS ABOUT WHERE AR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM RESIDES SO IF I WERE TO OFFER A SET OF TOOLS AROUND THESE TOPICS OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT I WOULD SAY FIRST OF ALL YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER NOT YOU FALL INTO THE SECURE AN SECURE OR OTHER ON ATTACHMENT STYLES SECOND I THINK IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US BUT CERTAINLY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN RELATIONSHIPS OR SEEKING RELATIONSHIPS TO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST HAVE SOME RECOGNITION OF WHERE AR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TENDS TO RESIDE BOTH IN TERMS OF WHEN WE ARE WITH SOMEBODY AND WHEN THEY LEAVE WHEN WE ARE A PART FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME CAN WE CALM OURSELVES CAN WE SELF SOOTHE OR ARE WE VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER IN ORDER TO FEEL SOOTH NOW A ABSOLY WANTO EMPHASIZED THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG IN FACT THERE'S EVERYTHING RIGHT WITH FEELING GREAT IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEBODY ELSE THAT IS ACTUALLY A A HULMARK OF OF STRONG AND QUALITY ATTACHMENTS THESE DAYS WE HEAR THE TERM CODEPENDENT A LOT THIS WAS A I BELIEVE THE TERM WAS FIRST COIN BY PEAMELODY AND IT ACTUALLY DOES OCCUPY AN IMPORTANT ROLL IN THE WORLD OF TROMA TROMA HEALING SO CALLED TROMABONDING TOPICS OF ANOTHER EPISODE ACTUALLY DID AN EPISODE ON FEAR AND TROMAN WE WILL DO ONE ALL ABOUT TRMABONDING WITH AN EXPERT ON SOME POINT IN TH FUTURE BUT CODEPENDENCE AND CODEPENDENCY THAT THE TERM CAN SOMETIMES BE MISINTERPRETED O AS ANY DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER IS IT GOOD A INTERDEPENDENCE A HEALTHY INTERDEPENDENCE OF COURSE IS GOOD IT IS THE HALMARK OF HEALTHY CHILD PARENT RELATION SIBBLING RELATIONS AND ROMANTIC RELATIONS BUT A KEY ELEMENT OF HEALTHY INTERDEPENDENCE IS THAT YES OR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ADJUSTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER BUT THAT ALSO THAT WE CAN ADJUST OUR OWN AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT PERSON THAT IF THE PERSON GOES AWAY TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY THAT WE CAN STILL REGULATE OUR OWN AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BOTH FROM STATES OF STRESS TO STATES OF CALM BOTH FROM STATES OF EXHAUSTION TO STATES OF MORE O ALERTNESS AND OF COURSE WE ALL NEED SLEEP TO GO FROM EXHAUSTION O TO ALERTNESS BUT WHAT IAM REFERRING TO HERS THE ABILITY TO REGULATE WHEN DISTRAUGHT OR REGULATE WHEN A FATIGUE A OR FEELING DEPRESSED AND THAT IS AND IS ALL ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO AS WE TALK ABOUT ATTACHMENT STYLES WE TALK ABOUT INFANT AND TODDLER AND ADULT ATTACHMENT TILES WHAT WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS A COMPLEX SET OF NEURAL CIRCUITRIES AND ONE OF THOSE NERAL CIRCUITRIES WHICH IS ABSOLUTE CRUCIAL IS THIS AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO IF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ONE KEY COMPONENT OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT WHAT ARE THE OTHER TO AND WHEN A MTELLUNEXT IS LARGELY THE PIONEERING WORK OF HELLEN FISSURE WHO A IS REALLY AN ANTHROPOLOGIST WHOSE BECOME A BIT OF A NERO SCIENTISTS AND IS COLLABORATED WITH NEURO SCIENTIST TO ESTABLISH BRAINAREAS AND NEURAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF ATTACHMENT LOVE AND DESIRE I THINK THE FIRST REALLY HIGH QUALITY STUDY OF NERL CIRCUITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THEMES WAS A PAPER PUBLISH IN TWO THOUES IN FIVE IN A VERY FINE AND ATOMICAL JOURNAL PERHABS THE BEST NEURO ANATOMICAL JOURNAL WHICH IS THE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY A THE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AND IS CONSIDER THE AR CIVAL LOCATION FOR PLACING O REALLY HIGH QUALITY ANATOMY THEY HAVE TREMENDOUSLY HIGH STANDARDS AND THE STUDY THAT IM REFERRING TO IS ENTITLED ROMANTIC LOVE AND EPHEMORI MEANING FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STUDY OF A NEURAL MECHANISM FOR MATE CHOICE AND A DOCTOR FISHER IS AA AUTHOR ON THIS PAPER AS IS ARTHUR ERR RN AND LUCY BROWN SO ALL VERY FINE RESEARCHERS AND THIS STUDY AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES USING MAGNETIC RESIDENC IMAGING THINGS LIKE E G NERANTOMICAL TRACING ET CETERA HAVE IDENTIFIED A LARGE NUMBER OF BRAIN AREAS THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT ND I'LE JUST THROW OUT A FEW NAMES OF THOSE BRAIN AREAS IN WHAT THEY CONTROL AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU HOW THOSE ANCHOR TO THE OTHER TWO CATEGORIES OF NEURL CIRCUITS ESSENTIAL FOR DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT SO NOT SURPRISINGLY THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT AND MAINLY WITH DESIRE ALTHOUGH TO SOME EXTENT LOVE DOPOMINE IS A NOROCHEMICAL SOMETIMES ASSOCIATE WITH REWARD BUT AS SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY A BEFORE IT IS MAINLY A MOLECULE OF MOTIVATION CRAVING AND PURSUIT AND THAT MOTIVATION CRAVING IN PURSUIT THAT RELATES DOPAOMINE IS NOT UNIQUE TO ATTACHMENT OR LOVE OR SEX OR MADING ET CETERA IT IS A UNIVERSAL GENERIC CURRENCY IN THE BRAIN FOR PURSUING SOMETHING FOOD WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY A A MATE WHEN YOU WANT ONE TO MATE WHEN YOU WANT TO A WARMTH WHEN YOUR COLD ET CETERA ET CETERA OCA SO IT'S NOT FOR ONE SPECIFIC PURPOSE BUT THE BRAIN AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH DOPOMINE INVOLVE A FOR INSTANCE THE VENTURAL TAGMENTALAREA THE SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA A ARES OF THAT SORT THE BASAL GANGLIA A YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THESE NAMES JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE NETWORKS OF NURONS THAT TEND TO PUT THE PERSON YOU INTO A STATE OF FORWARD ACTION AND PURSUIT AND CRAVING AND MOTIVATION THEY ARE NOT ABOUT BEING QUIESCENT RELAXED ET CETERA THE NEURL CIRCUITS FOR QUIESCENCE AND RELAXATION ARE MOST ISSOCIATED WITH LOVE AND ATTACHMENT NOT SURPRISINGLY AND THERE THE NERCHEMICAL CERATONAN AND TO SOME EXTENT OXYTOSIN ARE THE PREDOMINANT NEUROCHEMICALS INVOLVED AND THOSE ARE RELEASED FROM BRAIN AREA SUCH AS THE RAPHE NUCLIUS IN THE BACK OF TE BRAIN YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THE MAJORITY OF OF CERETONE IN YOUR BODY IS MADE IN YOUR GUT AND INDEED THAT'S TRUE BUT I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU THE CERATONIN YOUR GUT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR FEELINGS OF LOVE AND ATTACHMENT AT LEAST NOT TO A HIGH DEGREE THAT'S MAINLY GOING TO BE THE REFLECTION OF NEURANT IN YOUR BRAIN THAT MAKE CERATONEN AND THERE ARE OTHER AIRS OF THE BRAIN THAT MAKE CERATONAN AS WELL AN OXYTOSIN AS WELL BUT THEY TEND TO BE ASSOCIATE WITH THE KIND OF WARMTH AND CALM AND A THE SOOTHING THAT WE FEEL IN THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER AND AGAIN THESE ARE NOT STRICTLY DIVIDED CIRCUITS WE CAN HAVE DOPOMIN EN CERAETONE AN PRESENT IN OUR BRAIN ANDBODY AT THE SAME TIME TO EQUAL OR OR DIFFERENT DEGREES AND WE WERE TURN IN A LOBIT TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN LEVELS OF DOPOMINE ARE VERY HIGH IN LEVELS OF CERETONE AR LOW AND VICE VERSA AND SO ON INCLUDING IN STATES OF A A NEUROCHEMICALLY MODIFIED STATES  AS IT WERE AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE M D M A SO CALLED ECSTASY BUT IN THE MEANTIME I WANTED JIST DISCUSS THE TO NERAL CIRCUITS THAT USE DOPOMINE THAT YOU CERATONE IN AN OXYTOSEN AND THAT COLLABORATE WITH THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TO DRIVE WHAT WE CALL DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT AND THE THREE CIRCUITES ARE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ONE THEN THERE'S THE NERVOUS SYSTEM COMPONENTS ORE THE NERL CIRCUITS FOR EMPATHY FOR BEING ABLE TO SEE AND RESPOND TO AND INDEED MATCH THE EMOTIONAL TONE OR THE AUTONOMIC TONE OF ANOTHER AND THEN THERE'S THE THIRD CATEGORY AND THIS MIGHT SURPRISE SOME OF YIOU IT CERTAINLY SURPRISE ME BUT THE DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT THE THIRD NERL CIRCUIT THAT VERY IMPORTANT FOR ESTABLISHING BONDS IS ONE ASSOCIATE WITH POSITIVE DELUSIONS SO GIVEIN THAT THE NERL CIRCUITS FOR EMPATHY ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL FOR FALLING IN LOVE AND MAINTAINING STABLE ATTACHMENTS I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE NERL CIRCUITS AN WHAT THEY ARE NOW OFTEN WHEN WE HEAR EMPATHY WE THINK OH EMPATHY IS REALLY ABOUT LISTENING TO AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS FEELING MAYBEVEN FEELING WHAT THERE FEELING AND INDEED THAT'S THE CASE BUT WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT WHAT IS IT TO FEEL WHAT ANOTHER FEELS WELL WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THEIR SEE SAW IS DRIVING YOUR SEA SAW OR YOUR SEE SAW IS SOMEHOW DRIVING THEIR SEA SAW THAT THERE'S A MATCH IN TERMS OF THE TILT OF THOSE SEASAWS NOW DOESN'T HOTE TO BE AN EXACT MATCH RIGHT IF SOME ONE THAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT IS VERY VERY STRESS YOU COULD ALSO BECOME VERY STRESS THAT'S A FORM OF EMPATHIC MATCHING AND THERE ARE INDEED NERL CIRCUITS FOR THAT A'LL DESCRIBE WHAT THOSE NERL CIRCUITS ARE IN A MOMENT BUT SOMETIMES THE BEST ROLE FOR US TO TAKE IS ACTUALLY ONE IN WHICH WE ARE CALM WHEN THE PERSON THAT WE CARE ABOUT OR THAT WE ARE ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH IS VERY VERY ANXIOUS AND IN A FEW MINUTES I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW MATCHING OF EMOTIONAL TONE CAN BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE STABILITY OF A RELATIONSHIP AND COMPLIMENTARITY OF AUTONOMIC MATCHING CAN BE GOOD OR BAD IN OTHER WORDS SOMETIMES IT'S BENEFICIAL FOR AUR RELATIONSHIP TO GO INTO THE SAME STATE AS THE OTHER AND SOMETIMES IT'S MORE BENEFICIAL FOR US TO NOT GOINGTO THE SAME STATE AS THE OTHER BUT THE IMPORTANT FEATURE HERE IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EMOTIONAL MATCHING OR EMPATHY ARE GOING INTO THE SAME STATE OR NOT GOING INTO TE SAME STATE WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS WHETHER OR NOT THE AUTONOMIC SEE SAW OF ONE INDIVIDUAL IS DRIVING THE AUTONOMIC SESAW OF THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL AND THIS IS A VITAL PRINCIPLE FOR HOW WE FALL IN LOVE AND FORM ATTACHMENTS AND IT'S ACUALLY PART OF THE DESIRE AND MADING PROCESS ITSELF I WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE PRE REQUISITES TO THE PROPAGATION AND EXPANSION OF OUR SPECIES IS THIS NOTION OF AUTONOMIC REGULATION AND TO SOME EXTENT MATCHING OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS I ME EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN LAST I CHECKED THE ONLY WAY THAT NEW HUMANS CAN BE CREATED IS BY WAY OF SPERM MEETING EGG EITHER IN BODY OR IN DISH A BUT SPRM MEATS EGG AND THEN TYPICALLY NINE MONTHS LATER WE HAVE A HUMAN BABY THE PROCESS OF BRINGING SPERM TO EGG RIGHT MATING BEHAVIOR SEX BEHAVIOR IN HUMANS IS ONE OF AUTONOMIC REGULATION AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE PROCESS OF FINDING A MATE AND IN THIS CASE I MEAN ACTUALLY SOME ONE TO MATE WITH TYPICALLY WHILE CYNARIOS VERY TYPICALLY IS ONE OF ELEVATED AUTONOMIC AROUSAL MEANING INCREASED ACTIVATION OF THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THIS IS RELATED TO DOPOMINE RELEASE AND ITS RELATTED TO EPONEPERAN RELEASE THERE HAS TO BE A PURSUIT OR AT LEAST THERE HAS TO BE A MOBILIZATION TO ARRIVE IN THE SAME LOCATION HEREBY ONE CAN MATE RIGHT THAT THAT ALMOST ALWAYS IS THE CASE HOWEVER THE SEXUAL AROUSAL ITSELF IS IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES IS ACTUALLY DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE PARI SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO WHILE PURSUIT IS ONE OF ALERTNESS AND SYMPATHETIC DRIVE AS WE SAY AGAINST SYMPATHY IS NOT REALLY WHATS A AT PLAY HERE THAT THE WORD SYMPA MEANS TOGETHER AND THE ACTIVATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TOWARD MORE ALERT STATE IS BECAUSE OF A SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM MEAN THE COACTIVATION TOGETHER OF MANY NURONS IN THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD BUT THEN THE ACTUAL PHYSIAL LOGICAL AROUSAL STATE THAT WE CALL SEXUAL AROUSAL IS PREDOMINANTLY PARI SYMPATHETICALLY DRIVEN OKI A TO BE QUITE DIRECT ABOUT THIS IF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVATION IS TOO HIGH THE SEXUAL ROUSAL RESPONSE CANNOT HAPPEN IN EITHER MALES OR IN FEMALES ITS INHIBITED HOWEVER THE ORGASM AND EJACULATION RESPONSE WHICH IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS REQUIRED FOR SPIRM TO ME EGG IS SYMPATHETIC DRIVEN AND THEN AFTER ORGASM AND EJACULATION THE PARI SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM KICKS BACK IN AND THERE'S A CALMING AND RELAXATION SO THE ORC OF MATING INVOLVES SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL OKE NOT SYMPATHY BUT ALERTNESS AND AROUSAL FOR PURSUIT THEN A TILT OF THE SEASAW AT LEAST TO SOME DEGREE FOR AROUSAL OF THE SORT THAT WE TYPICALLY HEREOF OF SEXUAL AROUSAL THEN AT THE POINT OF ORGASM AND EJACULATION IS BACK TO A SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE AND WHAT HOW CAN I SAY THAT HOW DO I KNOW THAT THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM MEANING NURONS WITHIN THE SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OR WHAT DRIVE EJACULATION AND ORGASM AND THEN AFTERWARD THERE'S A RET TURN TO INCREASED PARI SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHY THAT HAPPENS BUT IT'S THOUGHT THAT IN SPECIES THAT PERBOND HUMANS GENERALLY PERBON NOT ALWAYS THERE THE RETURN TO MORE PARISYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AFTER ORGASM AND EJACULATION IS THOUGHT TO INCREASE THE EXCHANGE OF FERMONAL ORDERS ODERS SCUSEME AND TO INCREASE PILLO TALC AND PARBONDING OF DIFFERENT KINDS OKI SO THAT'S THE THE THE CESAW GOING BACK IN FORTH IS ACTUALLY BUILT IN TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH OUR ENTIRE SPECIES PROPAGATES SO IN SOME WAYS EVERY HUMAN IS REQUIRED TO NAVIGATE THAT PROCESS IF THEY WANT THEIR OFFSPRING TO PERSIST AND OF COURSE NOWDAYS THEREARE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE IN VETROFERTALIZATION ININTREU INTREUTERAN IN SEMINATION THEIR VARIETY OF WAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ALLOWED PEOPLE TO CIRCUMVENT THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL MADING PROCESS IN THE WAY THAT I DESCRIBED BUT BYNLARGE THAT'S THE WAY ITS DONAN CERTAINLY THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS DONE A HISTORICALLY FOR IF NOT A TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS THAT PROCESS IS ALSO WHAT HAPPENS IN ALL MAMALIAN SPECIES THAT DMATE OCHESAWIM OVERLOOKING AN ENTIRE LITERATURE OF A ANIMAL STUDIES O THE CLASSIC STUDIES OF THIS WERE DONE BY TWO INDIVIDUALS I'VE JUST BRIEFLY MENTION THEM IN CASE YOU WANT O LOOK AT THE THE LITERATURE THEREIS A AGUIAT THE ROCCOFELLER UNIVERSITY NAMED DONALD FAFF P F A F F WHO HAS DONE BEAUTIFUL STUDIES IDENTIFYING THE NERL CIRCUITRY WHAT'S CALLED THE LOR DOSIS RESPONSE UNLIKE IN HUMANS THE A MATING BEHAVIOR OF ANIMALS IS RATHER STEREOTYPED N TERMS OF THE POSITIONS THAT THEY OCCUPY AND THE LORD DOSIS RESPONSE IS A KIND OF A USHAPING OR A A BENDING UP OF THE HIND QUARTERS OF TIFICALLY OF RODANTS BUT OF OTHER ANIMALS IS WELL THE MAM A THE MAL MOUNTING IS ALMOST ALWAYS FROM BEHIND EXCEPT IN SOME SPECIES OF PRIMATES AND THAT LORDOSIS RESPONSE IS ONLY GOING TO OCCUR DURING PARTICULAR PHASES OF THE ESTRAS CYCLE THE ESTRACYCLE IS SORT OF THE  A ANALOGUE TO THE MENSTRAL CYCLE BUT ITS NOT TWENTY EIGHT DAYS ITS FOUR DAYS OR SOME OTHER A DURATION IN A OTHER ANIMALS DEPENDING ON THE ANIMAL THE LORD DOSIS RESPONSE IS STRONGLY REGULATED BY ODORS BY CONTACT AND IS ESTERGEN AND TESTOSTERON UM CONTROLLED AND THEN THE MALE PORTION OF OF THE MADING A SEQUENCE IN ANIMALS  THE MOUNTING AND THRUSTING AND EJACULATION AS THA CALLEDTHEIR MOUNTING TRUSTING INTROMISSION AND EJACULATION THOSE OF TE FOR A SCIENTIFIC CATEGORIES THATHAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AM THAT'S PRESENCE IN RODENS AND ALSO AN IN DOGUS WHERE IT WAS PRIMARILY STUDIED BY FRANC BEACH WHO WAS A  AT A UNIVERSY CALFORNIA BERKLY FOR A LONG TIME AND THE ENTIRE LITERATURE AROUND THE NERAL CIRCUITRY FOR SECUAL N MANING BEHAVIOR IN ANIMALS LARGELY STEMMED A FROM THE WORK OF DONALD FAFF AND FRANK BEACH AND THEIR SCIENTIFIC OFFSPRING NOT THEIR ACTUAL OFFSPRING A YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT LITERATURE IF YOU LIKE THERE HAVE BE IN HUMAN NEURO IMAGING STUDIES OF THE PROCESS THAT I DESCRIBED A FEW MINUTES AGO BELIEVE IT OR NOT OF PEOPLE IN BRAIN SCANNERS A NOT NECESSARILY MATING WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT GOING THROUGH THAT ARC OF AROUSAL A A SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION DURING ORGASMOR EJACULATION AND THE POST EJACULATORY OR OR ORGASMIC PACE IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THE BRAINARI ES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE HAVE ALL BEEN MAPPED OUT NOW A THE SPINAL CORDAREAS THAT CONTROL A THINGS LIKE A A ERECTION OF AGENAL LUBRICATION EJACULATION AND ORGASM THOSE HAVE ALSO BEEN MAPPED OUT AND THIS HAS ALL BEEN EXPLORED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OF BOTH BASIC SCIENCE JUST TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR SPECIES A HAS SEXUAL INTERACTIONS AND REPRODUCES BUT ALSO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FOR INSTANCE A TRYING TO REPAIR A SEXUAL FUNCTION AFTER SPINAL CORT INJURY WHICH A IS YOU KNOW A PROMINENT CONCERN FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR INJURY BUT IN A IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE SPINAL CORT INJURIES SO THIS IS BOTH VITAL BIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL DATA THE NEURAL CIRCUITS FOR EVERYTHING THAT I JUST DESCRIBED RESIDE IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ARE CORDINATED WITH THE NERAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH EMPATHY THE NERL CIRCUITS FOR AMPATHY AGAIN THERE ARE MANY BUT MAINLY TWO STRUCTURES THAT YOU SHOULD NO ABOUT THE PREFRUNTAL QUARTEX WHICH IS HOW WE PERCEIVE THINGS OUTSIDE OF US AND MAKE DECISIONS ON THE BASIS OF THOSE PERCEPTIONS HOW WE ORGANIZE THOSE DECISIONS AND ANARE OF THE RING CALLED THE INSULA I AND ESU ALA THE INSULA IS A REALLY INTERESTING BRAIN AREA THAT ALLOWS US TO INTERROCEPT TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OUR BODY AND TO SPLIT SOME OF OUR ATTENTION TO EXTEROCEPT AND THE MATING DANCE WHETHER NOT ITS A THE DINNER IN DATE PORTION OF THE MAITING DANCE OR THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL DANCE PART OF THE MAIN DANCE OR ACTUAL MATING AN INSEXUAL BEHAVIOR KISSING OR OTHERWISE THAT IS A CORDINATED ACTIVITY OF TWO BODIES TYPICLATES TO I REALIZE SOMETIMES IT'S MORE SOMETIMES IT'S ONLY ONE BUT TYPICALLY IT'S TWO A BODIES IN THE ELEAST IN THE FRAMEWORK WERE USING HERE THAT CORDINATED DANCE IS ONE IN WHICH THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OF ONE INDIVIDUAL IN GENERAL IS CORDINATING WITH THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL AND THE INSULA IS ESSENTIALLY SPLITTING ONE'S ATTENTION BETWEEN HOW WE FEEL OURSELVES HOW OUR BODY FEELS WHAT WERE THINKING WITH THE THINKING AND THE BODIES BODILY SENSATIONS OF THE OTHER AND THAT CAN BE COMMUNICATED OBVIOUSLY THROUGH WORDS I CAN BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH SOUNDS IT CON BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH TOUCH AND IT CAN BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH A NUMBER OF  OF KIND OF MORE SUBTLE CUES LIKE PUPIL SIZE OR WHETHER NOT A CERTAINLY IN CASES WHERE WE RECOGNIZE THE PERSON AND WE KIND OF NO THEIR RESPONSES THEIR AUTONOMIC RESPONSES UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS WE CAN A SESS IT IS THE PERSON COMFORTABLE ARE THEY UNCOMFORTABL ARE TH AY A ARE THEY MORE FOCUSED ON ME OR ON THEMSELVES THIS IS THAT THE CORDINATED SILENT DANCE THAT IF WE LOOK OUT IN NEROBIOLOGICAL TERMS WE CAN REALLY SEE IS ALL ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHETHER OR NOT A IT'S A TIME TO TYP THESEYSAW TO TO ONESIDE OR THE OTHER DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT THE OTHER PERSONS SEE SAW IS TILTED HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE OTHER O CASE WE HAVE THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THEN WE HAVE THIS THING THAT WE'ARE CALLING EMPATHY WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT AUTONOMIC MATCHING AND AGAIN THE INSOLA AN THE PREFRONT AL QUARTEX ARE NERAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE CRUCIAL FOR AUTONOMIC MATCHING BECAUSE THEY ALLOW US TO SAY WHAT'S OUT THERE AND DO I WANT A MATCH TO IT OR NOT OKI AND THEN THE THIRD CATEGORY OF NERAL CIRCUIT THAT HELEN FISHURE AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND TO BE IMPORTANT FOR DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT IS THE NERAL CIRCUIT ASSOCIATED WITH SELF DELUSION WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT WELL FIRST OF ALL SELF DELUSION IMPLIES A KIND OF A CYNICISM ABOUT LOVE AND ATTACHMENT AND I THINK IT WAS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW THAT SAID A LOVE IS REALLY ABOUT OVERESTIMATING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS A I SHUL WHEN I HEAR THAT AND AS I SAY IT I REALY DON'T LIKE THAT QUOTE A MI H'VE NO BONE TO PIC WOULH GEORGE BERNARD SHAW BUT WHUT I SUGGESTS AND I THINK WHAT HE MEANT WAS THAT A YOU KNOW IN LOVE AND ATTACHMENT WE TEND TO PUT SO MUCH VALUE IN THE OTHER THAT WE FORGET THAT MANY OF THE PROCESSIES THAT ARE GOING ON IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY ACTUALLY COULD BE EVOKED BY MANY OTHER PEOPLE TOO BUT I THINK IT SOMEWHAT OVERLOOKS THE ENORMOUS POWER OF ATTACHMENT AND THE WAYS IN WHICH SOMEBODY SMELL SOMEBODYES VOICE SOMEBODIES A EVERYTHING OR SOMEBODY'S PARTICULAR THING OR THINGS CAN REALLY BECOME SO VITAL FOR OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TO FEEL SOOTHED AND TO FEEL ELATED ET CETERA SO I THINK THAT A WHILE THE QUOTE A IS ACCURATE IN THE ONE SENSE I THINK IT DOES OVERLOOK A THE NERAL CIRCUITS FOR ATTACHMENT AND JUST HOW DEEPLY WIRE THOSE CAN BECOME FOR US SO I WILL BALANCE THAT QUOTE WITH A AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF OTHER QUOTES THAT I I I WON'T  MENTION BUT THT YOU CAN FIND OUT THERE THER REALLY POINT TO YOU KNOW HOW INCREDIBLE A THE PERSON IS THAT ONE TENDS TO BE ATTACH YOU THAT THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE OR YOU KNOW OR OR SEVERAL A PEOPLE THAT COULD EVER EXISTS THAT CULD EVOKE THOSE FEELINGS FROM US AND OF COURSE YOU CAN READOUR YOU KNOW A NERUDA POETRY AND YOUR THAT YOU CAN FIND THESE THINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MUSIC AN POETRY AND WRITING SO FOR EVERY CYNICAL QUOTE ABOUT THESE NERL CIRCUITS BEING GENERICAND A COULD BE ACTIVATED BY ANYBODY I THINK YOU'LL FIND A AN AMPLE NUMBER OF A OPPOSING QUOTES THAT THESE NERAL CIRCUITS CAN ONLY BE ACTIVATED BY THAT SPECIAL SOME ONE OR THAT PARTICULAR PERSON ARE MAY BE IN JUST A SMALL SET OF THOSE PEOPLE SO WHAT OF DELUSION WELL THE WORK OF HELEN FISHURE AN OTHERS HAS REALLY POINTED TO THE FACT THAT DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT ARE THREE SEPARATE PHASES OF WHAT WE CALL ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT TYPICALLY NOT ALWAYS BUT TYPICALLY DESIRE TENDS TO COME FIRST OR FALLS IN THE EARLY PHASE THAT THE PROCESS OF ROMANTIC SLASH SEXUAL INTERACTIONS IT DOESN'T NESSARILY HAVE TO BE SEX ITSELF BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES INTIMINTIMACY OF SOME KIND RIGHT AND GENERALLY TOUCH OF SOME KIND EVENTUALLY TRANSITIONS INTO WHAT WE CALL LOVE WHICH EVENTUALLY TRANSITIONS INTO WHAT WE CALL ATTACHMENT AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION TOUCH BECAUSE TOUCH IS A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS THERE'S A AN ARTICLE O A RESEARCHARTICLE SHOULD SAY THE TITLE OF IT IS RELATIONSHIP SPECIFIC IND CODING OF SOCIAL TOUCH IN SEMATICENSORY AND INSULAR CORCORTESES CORTESES BEING CORTEX CORTEXIS PLORAL ORTESES AND AGAIN THEIRS OUR FRIEND THE INSULA SO THIS IS A STUDY THAT EXPLORED WHAT BRAIN AREAS AND WHAT BODY AREAS ARE ACTIVATED BY SPECIFIC FORMS OF ATTACHMENT AND SOCIAL TOUCH AND WHAT THEY FOUND NOT SURPRISINGLY IS THAT THE THE THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THEIREASSOCIATED WITH TOUCH THE SEMOUT ICENSURIAREAS BUT MORE INTERESTINGLY THE INSULA QARTEX OR STRONGLY ACTIVATED BY TOUCH SO TOUCH IN THE AMOUNT OF TOUCHING AND PROXIMITY AND SKIN CONTACT NOT SURPRISINGLY ACTIVATES BRAINARYAS HE SOCIATED WITH SEMADISENSORY TOUCH BUT ALSO THE INSULAR QUARTEX WHICH AGAIN IS THIS BRAINAREA THAT LINKS THE INTERNAL OUR FEELINGS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE US AND AT THE SURFACE OF OUR SCKIN WITH EVENTS EXTERNAL AND THEY FOUND ACTIVATION OF NUMBER OF BRAIN AREAS THE EMIGDULA OR BER TO FRON A QUARTEX AND SO ON AND SO ON THAT'S NOT IS ESSENTIAL IS JUST UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INSULA IS THE PLACE IN WHICH WE START TO TAKE OUR EXPERIENCE OF OUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE ATTACH THAT TO OUR PERCEPTIONS OF THE EXTERNAL LANDSCAPE AND THEN ASSIGN THAT OF VALUE OR SIGN THAT SOME SORT OF INTERPRETATION AND POSITIVE DELUSION IS PREDICTIVE OF LONG TERM ATTACHMENT WHAT WE MEAN BY POSITIVE DELUSION POSIVE DELUSION IS THE CONTRADICTION OF THAT GEORGE BERNARD SHAW QUOT IT'S THE BELIEF THAT ONLY THIS PERSON CAN MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY THIS OTHER PERSON HOLDS THE CAPACITY TO MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONALLY OR BOTH AND SO AS WE MOVE FROM DESIRE TO LOVE TO ATTACHMENT OUR BRAIN CIRCUITRY IS LITERALLY GETTING TUNED UP SUCH THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE ATTACHED TO AGAIN HERE THINKING ABOUT MONOGAMISTS RELATIONSHIPS BUT IT IGIS FOR NOMONOGMIS RELATION SHULD BE INDIVIDUALS IS AN ORE THE WAY IN WHICH OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SESTEM CAN BE REGULATED THEY ACTUALLY GET ACCSESS TO OUR CONTROL PANEL SO IT'S OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM EMPATHY AND THIS POSITIVE DELUSION NOW POSITIVE DEL UTION IS CRITICAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE STABILITY OF RELATIONSHIPS OVER TIME SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED MAINLY BY PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT NOW ALSO BY NERBIOLOGIS WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THEREOR SOME KEY FEATURES OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT PREDICT THAT A RELATIONSHIP WILL LAST AND THOSE ARE MANY BUT MAINLY FALL UNDER THIS CATEGORY OF POSITIVE DELUSIONS I'LL RETURN TO THOSE IN WHAT THOSE EXACTLY LOOK LIKE BUT THERE ARE ALSO JUST A HANDFUL OF THINGS THAT PREDICT THAT A RELATIONSHIP WILL FAIL OVER TIME THIS IS LARGELY THE WORK OF THE GOPMENS AS ISHALLY A HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM UP THE UNIVERSE CITY OF WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE A THE GOTMENS I HAVE RUN A LABORATORY IN THE DEPARTMENT PSYCHOLOGY FOR LONG TIME THEY 'VE ALSO DONE A LOT OF PUBLIC FACING WORK AROUND RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT A THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT PREDICT EITHER STAYING TOGETHER OR BREAKING UP SO MUCH SO THAT THEY'VE ESTABLISHED A METHOD BY WHICH THEY CAN LOOK AT VIDIO INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COUPLES AND WITH VERY HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY PREDICT WHETHER NOT THOSE COUPLES WILL STAY TOGETHER OR BREAK UP OVER TIME AND THEYH'VE IDENTIFIED WHAT THEY CALL THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF RELATIONSHIPS THESE ARE THINGS THAT A ESSENTIALLY ALMOST ALWAYS PREDICT THAT A COUPLE WILL BREAK UP AND I THINK THE CURRENT NUMBER ON THIS IS THAT GOTMEN CAN PREDICT DIVORCE WITH NINETY FOUR PER CENT ACCURACY WHICH IF WE THINK ABOUT IS PRETTY REMARKABLE S EVEN THOUGHOM THESE ARE PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES AM I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY A ANALYSIES OF UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGY THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THEY CAN OBSERVE BETWEEN COUPLES THAT CAN LEAD THEM TO PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT A COUPLE WILL STAY TOGETHER OR BREAK UP WITH NINETY FOUR PER CENT ACCURACY SO WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS THOSE FOUR BEHAVIORS WHAT THEY CALL THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPS OF FOR RELATIONSHIPS A OR ONE CRITICISM TO DEFENSIVENESS THREE STONE WALLING AND FOR CONTEMPT WITH CONTEMPT BEING A THE MOST POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF  BREAKING UP A CRITICISM OF COURSE DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE'S A NO PLACE FOR CRITICISM IN STABLE RELATIONSHIPS OF COURSE THERE IS I HAS TO DO WITH HOW FREQUENT AND HOW INTENSELY THAT CRITICISM IS VOICE DEFENSIVENESS OF COURSE IS DEFENSIVENESS A WE KNOW AS THE SORT OF LACK OF ABILITY TO HERE ANOTHER OR TO ADOPT THEIR STAND SO LACK OF EMPATHY I THINK IS IS OF A ONE WAY TO INTERPRET DEFENSIVENESS STONE WALLING WHICH IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER FORM OF LACK OF EMPATHY ITS A TURNING OFF OF THE NERAL CIRCUIT THAT SO CRITICAL FOR A DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT THE STONE WALLING ESSENTIALLY MEANS A THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE OR THE REQUEST OF ANOTHERIS COMPLETELY CUT OFF SO ITS IT'S A I DON'T THINKTHERE'S BEEN BRAIN IMAGING OF THIS BUT WE I THINK WE CAN REASONABL LY IMAGINE THAT IT INVOLVES A UNTETHERING YOUR INSOL OF RESPONSE FROM THE OTHER AND WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH AND FOCUSING YOUR INSOLER RESPONSE A NOPUN INTENDED ON YOUR OWN INTERNAL STATE OR PERHAPS THE STATE OF A SOME ONE ELSE ENTIRELY TALK ABOUT INFIDELITY IN A MOMENT AND THEN CONTEMPT AND CONTEMPT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN REFERRED TO AS THE SULPHURIC ACID OF RELATIONSHIP I DIDN'T SAY THAT BUT GOTMEN AN CALLEAGUES HAVE THAT IT IS A SUCH A POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF DIVORCE AND BREAK UPS AIN THE FUTURE AND CONTEMPT OF COURSE A BY DEFINITION IS THE FEELING THAT A PERSON OR THING IS BENEATH CONSIDERATION WORTHLESSNESS OR DESERVING SCORN AND APPARENTLY THEY CAN IDENTIFY THIS IN THE VIDIOS OF A COUPLES HAVING DISCUSSIONS IN RACTING BY A VERY ELABORATE IROLLS BY EXPRESSIONS OF ANGER IN ONE INDIVIDUAL WHEN THEIR PARTNER IS ACTUALLY EXPRESSING ENTHUSIASM OR EXCITEMENT ABOUT SOMETHING IT'S THE A OYA YOU WOULD SAY THAT OR A OR DEEP SEETED RESENTMENT TOWARD THE OTHER SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S APPARENT THAT ONE ACCOUNT OF ACTIVELY DISLIKES THE OTHER PARTNER A SO CONTEMPT A DISREGARD FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS THE OTHERWATTED THINK ABOUT IT TH RUNS COUNTER TO ALL OF THE NARRAL CIRCUITS ALL THREE OF THE NARRL CIRCUITS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IT CERTAINLY IS A IT IS THE ANTITHESIS OF EMPATHY IT IS ANYTHING BUT A POSITIVE DELUSION IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL EITHER ACCURATELY OR INACCURATELY AS SOMEBODY THAT YOU KIND OF DESPISE AND THEN IT IS AN ABSOLUTE INVERSION OF THE AUTONOMIC CESAW MATCHING THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT BEFORE IT'S A DISSOCIATING OF YOUR SEE SAW FROM THEIR SES AUT THEYRE VERE EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING YOUR UNEXCITED BY IT IN FACT IT'S AN INVERSION OF THEIR SEASAW WHERE THEYRE EXCITED YOURE DOWN A THE'RE DOWN YOUR UP OKHASO IT'S IT'S A BASICALLY A AN INVERSION OF ALL OF THE NARL CIRCUITS THAT HELLENFISSURE IN OTHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED ITS CRITICAL FOR DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT AND THEREFORE IT'S WE NOT A SURPRISING THAT IS SO STRONGLY PREDICTIVE OF PREAK UPS AND IN THE CASE OF MARRIED COUPLES OF DIVORCE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THE WORK OF THE GOTMENS AND SIMILAR WORK THEY'VE WRITTEN SEVERAL POPULAR BOOKS  THEIR VERLY EASY TO FIND WE CAN LINK TO ONE OF THOSE IN THE ACAPTION A BUT THEY'VE ALSO DEVELOPED SOME A QUITE INTERESTING ON LINE RESOURCES A IN THEIR SO CALLED LOVE LAB I GUESS IT'S FORTUNATE THAT THEY DIN'T CALL IT THE A HATE LAB WERE THE BREAK UP LABE FOCUSS A LOD ON  WHAT PREDICTS BREAK UPS BUT THEY'VE ALSO A WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY AND RESEARCH EXTENSIVELY IN PURE REVIEWED STUDIES WHAT MAKES PEOPLE FIND APPROPRIATE PARTNERS FOR THEM AND A TO MAINTAIN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS OVER TIME SO YOU CAN GO A OU CAN SEARCH FOR LOVELAB UNIVERSAL WASHINGTON GOTMEN A OR ANY IN NUMBER OF THEIR VARIOUS BOOKS I THINK YOU'LL FIND SOME M SOME USEFUL RESOURCES THERE I WANT A SHIFT BACK TO THE WORK OF HELEN FISSHER A SHE'S MADE SOME VERY INTERESTING STATEMENTS AND SOME VERY INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS THAT AT LEAST TO MY MIND A MAT VERY WELL ON TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF NERL CIRCUITRY BOTH IN HUMANS AND IN NON HUMAN PRIMEATES AND AN OTHER SPECIES I REALIZE THAT  SHE'S THE ONLY NAME IN THE GAME A BUT SHE'S MADE SOME OBSERVATIONS THAT I THINK A ARE VERY AS WE SAY PARSIMONIOUS MEANING THEY ALLOW US TO ORGANIZE A LOT OF THIS STUFF INTO  SOME DISTINCT FRAME WORKS O SHE 'S ALSO DONE SOME REALLY BEAUTIFUL STUDIES A THAT INVOLVE DATA FROM MILLIONS OR EVEN TENS OF MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS ON DATING SIHT SOME CAN A SHARE THOSE WITH HUNA MOMENT BUT A BEFORE I DO THAT I JUST WANT TO A A PARAPHRASE A DOCTOR FISHER A WHO SAID THAT A SEX DRIVE OR DESIRE THAT THE PURSUIT OF SOME ONE TOO MATE WITH MEANING TOO MATE THE VERB A NOT NECESSARILY TO FIND AIMATE A MAY BE SHE DIDN'T SAY DEFINTIVELY BUT MAY BE AWAIT O FORAGE FOR POTENTIAL LOVE PARTNERS THAT THE THE ARC OF THIS A WHOLE BUSINESS IS REALLY THE ORDER THAT WERE DESCRIBING IT THAT IT'S DESIRE THEN LOVE AND THEN ATTACHMENT AND THAT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE CAN GET A CONFUSED A YOU MAY KNOW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE A YOU MAY BE ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT CONFUSE DESIRE FOR ATTACHMENT OR MIGHT CONFUSE A LOVE A FOR ATTACHMENT BUT THAT THERE'S A SEQUENCE OF RECRUITMENT OF THESE NARL CIRCUITS THAT ESTABLISHED FIRST FROM THE PURSUIT OF SOME ONE TO MATE WITH AND SHE'S PLACES IN THE CONTAXT OF KIND OF MORE MODERN DATING THEMES WHERE DEPENDING ON CULTURE A PEOPLE MIGHT EXPLORE A SEVERAL MAY BE MANY MANY A INDIVIDUALS BEFORE QOTINQ SETTLING DOWN A WITH WITH SOMEBODY AT LEAST FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME A I THNK THAT AN INTERESTING FRAME WORK A BECAUSE IT CIRCUMVENTS A LOT OF THE A FRANKLY UNANSWERABLE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A YOU KNOW HUMANS WER MEN TO BE MONAGAMES OR WHETHER NOT THEY WERN'T THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT HOLD CULTURAL CONTXT THAT HOLD A ALL SORTS OF CONTAXT THAT REALLY CAN'T BE ADDRESSED IN A LABORATORY SETTING BUT THIS IDEA THAT A SEX DRIVE IS A WAY TO FORAGE FOR POTENTIAL LOVE PARTNERS AND THAT LOVE IS A A KIND OF A LIPMOSS TEST FOR WHETHER NOT LONGER OR TERM OR DEEPER ATTACHMENTS CANON WELL FORM IS ONE THAT AT LEAST MAKE SENSE TO ME A LATER IN THE EPISODE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS NOTION OF A SEX DRIVE AND DESIRE ALOCTUALLY TALK ABOUT SOME TOOLS A THAT ARE THAT HA VERY STRONG DATA REALLY TO SUPPORT A THEM IN TERMS OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO OR TAKE TO INCREASE LABITO BOTH MEN AND WOMEN A BECAUSE THER THERE S ECTUALLY QUITE GOOD DATE ON THAT NOW BUT IN THE MEANTIME I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE WOR T THAT DOCTOR FISHER HAS DONE IN TERMS OF CATEGORIZING PEOPLE INTO AGAIN WE HAVE FOUR GROUPS A THESE ARE DISTINCT FROM THE A B C AND D ATTACHMENT STYLES DESCRIBED EARLIER ALTHOUGH AS I DESCRIBE THEM YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAP THEM SOMEWHAT ON TO THOSE AND THESE FOUR GROUPS A ARE GROUPS THAT WERE DEFINED THROUGH HER STUDIES OF PEOPLE THAT WERE OR ARE I DON'T KNO IF THEY WERE OR IF THEY ARE STILL ON MATCHSDOT CAM BUT A VERY EXTENSIVE DATA SET SO AGAIN MILLIONS IF NOT TENSIVE MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS THE NUMBER I HEARD HER QUOTE AND I A FORGIVE ME IF THIS IS NOT ACCURATE IS THAT IN UPWARDS OF FORTY MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEIR NEUROCHEMICAL AND HORMONE SYSTEMS ARE TUNED TOWARD PARTICULAR TYPES OF BEHAVIORS WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MALES AND FEMALES HAVE BOTH TESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN TYPICALLY AGAIN THESE ARE AVERAGES BOTYPICALLY MEN HAVE MORE TESTOSTERONE THAN THEY DO ESTROGEN AND THEY HAVE MORE TESTOSTERONE THAN DO WOMEN AND LESS ESTEROGEN THAN DO WOMEN TYPICALLY WOMEN HAVE MORE ESTEROGEN THAN THEY DO TESTOSTERONE AGAIN AVERAGES A AND THEY HAVE LESS TESTOSTERONE THAN MEN MORE ESTEROGEN THE MEN AND SO AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT BOTH HORMONE SYSTEMS ARE ACTIVE IN BOTH A A SETS OF INDIVIDUALS AND OF COURSE ALL HUMANS AS FAR AS WE KNOW MANUFACTURE BOTH DOPOMINE AND CERATONAN DOPOMINE AS I MENTION EARLIER HAS A NUMBER OF A AFFECTS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT ONE OF THE PRIMARY EFFECTSES THAT IT PLACES US IN TO STATES OF MOTIVATION AND PURSUIT A FOR VARIOUS THINGS THERE IS A SOMEWHAT CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM AND THE TESTOSTERONE SYSTEM A IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS THIS BRAINARY ABOVE THE RUFIOUR MOUTH AND THE PATUITARY GLAND WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING HORMONS THAT MAKE THE OVERIES AND OR TESTES A SECRETE A TESTOSTERONE OR ESTROGEN SO THERE'S A LOT OF SIGNALING THAT OCCURS SUCH THAT DOOMINE AND TESTOSTERONE TEND TO OPERATE AS AND OF CLOSE COUSINS IN A SYSTEM OF PURSUIT AND CONVERSELY THE CERATONAN SYSTEM TENDS TO ON AVERAGE COLLABORATE WITH THE ESTEROGEN SYSTEM TO IMPART CERTAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND BEHAVIORS SO THESE AREN'T HARDEN FAST A OR I GUESS A BETTER STATED F THESE AREN'T A STRICT BLACK AND WHITE CATERGRIZATIONS BUT I THINK THOSE GENERAL THEMES HOLD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ANIMAL AND A HUMAN DATA SO DOCTOR FISHER HAS TAKIN SOME SOME LIBERTIES BUT I THINK THEY ARE A WHAT I WOULD CALL LOGICALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY AND NUROBIOLOGICALLY GROUNDED LIBERTIES IN CLASSIFYING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON THESE DATING SITES ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF THINGS THEY REPORT ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THEY TEND TO MATCH WITH ON THESE DATING SITES AND CREATED THESE FO OR CATEGA CATEGORIES A THE FOUR CATEGORIES ARE A SHE CALLS ONE THE DOPAMINE AM CATEGORY SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE HIGH DOPAMINE AND A AGAIN THAT'S JUST A NAME IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE LO ANYTHING ELSE BUT THEY ARE HIGH ON THE DOPAMINE SCALE PEOPLE WHO RAT HIGH ON ON THE DOPAMIN SCALE TEND TO BE WHAT THE SCIENTISTS AND SYCHALL JIST CALL HIGH SENSATION SEEKING NOVELSEEKING THEY LIKE NEW THINGS THEY LIKE SPONTANEITY THEY TEND TO BE VERY ADVENTUROUS I THINK TATS LARGELY TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT IT A CONDITIONS WERE DOPAMINE IS A SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL ITS ELEVATED BEYOND ABNORMAL LEVELS A THINGS LIKE MANIA AM OR WHEN PEOPLE TAKE CERTAIN DRUGS OF ABUSE LIKE COCANE OR INPEDEMINE THAT REALLY RAISE DOPAMING LEVELS UP VERY VERY HIGH FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THEY DO TEND TO INCREASE ENERGE ENERGY MOTIVATION AND NOVELTY SEEKING AND OF COURSE DRUGS LIKE AMFEDEMING AND COCAAND HAVE ALL SORTS OF DILITERIOUS EFFECTS A THAT I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO HEAR BUT TS WORTH POINTING OUT BUT THEY DON'T TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE CALM AND RELAXED AND SEEK A A SOOTHING A INTERACTIONS CONVERSELY THE GROUP THAT A DOCTOR FISHER CALLS THE CERATONAN GROUP A TEND TO BE A MORE GROUNDED IN SOOTHING ACTIVITIES QUIECENT TAYPE ACTIVITIES THEY AR SHE TEND TO BE A ON AVERAGE THEY TEND TO LIKE RULES AND FOLLOW RULES THEY CAN BE HOME BODIES A THIS SORT OF THING THEY REALLY A YOU CAN IMAGINE THEM THE SORT OF STISTABLE TYPES BUT THEY REALLY LIKE STABILITY THE'E NOT REALLY INTO SPONTANEITY AS MUCH AGAIN AVERAGENS AND THEN SHE A CREATED  TWO OTHER CATEGORIES THE TESTOSTERONE CATEGORY OF HYGH TESTOSTERONE THE AGAIN COULD BE A MALES OR FEMALES AND THEN THE ESTROGEN A CATEGORY AGAIN CO BE MALES OR FEMALES AND SHE GAVE THESE DIFFERENT NAMES A THAT I WON'T GO INTO HERE YOU CAN LOOK UP HER WORK ON LINE BUT SHE YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THE DIRECTER AN A AND THE FOLLOWER IN THINGS IK THAT BUT I DON'T REALY WANT TO USE THOSE AS MUCH AS I WANT A STICK TO THE BIOLOGICAL TERMS SO WE HAVE DOPAMINE CERETONAN TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGENT NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN UNFAIR A CAIND OF A OVER GENERALIZATION BUT WHAT INTERESTING IS NOT NECESSARILY THE NAME OR THE NEROW CHEMICAL SYSTEM RIGHT THOSE COULD HAVE JUST BEEN CALLED CATEGORY ONE TO THREE AND FOUR FOR ALL THAT A THAT A MATTERS HERE WHAT IS INTERESTING IS SEEING HOW THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SHE ABSOLUTELY CAN CATEGORIZE BASED ON THEIR SELF REPORTED PREFERENCES ABOUT BEHAVIORS AND CERTAIN KINDS OF INTERACTIONS HOW THOSE GROUPS TEND TO PAR UP WITH PEOPLE IN THE SAME OR OPPOSITE CATEGORIES SO WHAT HER STUDIES REVEAL THAT PEOPLE THAT FALL INTO THE HIGH SENSATION SEEKING NOVELTIE SEEKING SPONTANEITY CATEGORY THE ONE THAT SHE CALLS THE HIGH DOPAMING CATEGORY TEND TO PAR UP WITH AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM TEND TO PAR UP WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO IN THAT DOPLEMEN URGET CATEGORY SO A THESE WOULD BE PEOPLE THAT WOULD SPONTANEOUSLY TAKE A TRIP OR EXPLORE SOMETHING NEW OR NEW RESTAURANT A THEY TEN TO BE A CREATIVE AND EXPLORATIVE TYPES A SO DAT GROUP ON AVERAGE TENDS TO DATE AND MATE AND POTENTIALLY A FORM LONG TERN RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN CATEGORY AN AVERAGES INDIVIDUALS THAT SHE PLACED INTO THE CERETONAN GROUP OR THE WHAT SHE HYPOTHESIZED WOULD BE A HYGH SERATONEAN GROUP CAN TEY  MEASURE CERETONIAN BUT PEOPLE THAT A TEND TO PLACE VALUE ON STABILITY ON RULES ON A CERTAIN FORMS OF KIND OF TRADITIONAL ORGANIZATION AT HOME AND IN RELATIONSHIPS THOSE PEOPLE ALSO TENDED TO PAR UP WITH SELECT DATE WE PRESUME MATE WITH A AND FORM STABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE IN THE SAME CATEGORY NOW INDIVIDUALS IN THE OTHER TWO CATEGORIES THE HYGH TESTOSTERONE GROUP AND AGAIN TESTOSTERUM WAS IN MEASURED BUT SHE CALLED IT THE HYGH TESTOSTERON GROUP BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT A TEND TO BE A VERY DIRECTIVE THEY TEND TO KNOW WHAT THEY WANTAND AR COMFORTABLE TELLING OTHER PEOPLE A WHAT THEY WANT AND FROM THEM THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT A IN HER STUDIES AND ANOTHER STUDIES  TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING MEANING THEY A NOT NECESSARILY CHALLENGING TO BE AROUND BUT THEY TEND TO CHALLENGE OTHER PEOPLE A KIND OF PUSH THEM IN ORDER TO A EXPAND THEIR BOUNDARIES EITHER A FOR SAKE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OR JUST IN GENERAL AND THE PEOPLE THEY TEND TO PUSH ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY A PAR UP WITH WHICH ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE ESTROGEN CATEGORY WHAT SHE CALLED HYGESTROGEN AGAIND THEY DIN MEASURE ESTROGEN WHAT THE PEOPLE IN TH ESTROGEN CATEGORY A WERE THE ONES THAT A DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHOICES IN LIFE AND THEIR PREFERENCES AS BE NURTURING THEY ACTUALLY SEEM TO LIKE IT WHEN SOME ONE ELSE A IS MAKING A THE MAJOR DECISIONS NOT EVERY DECISION OF THEY CERTAINLY LIKE TO BE HEARD OF COURSE  IN TERMS OF THEIR PREFERENCES BUT THAT THOSE TWO TYPES THE A WHAT SHE CALLED THE TESTOSTERON AND THE ESTROGEN TYPE TEND TO PAROP SO WHY ARE THESE CATEGORIZATIONS AND THESE AVERAGES INTERESTING TO ME AT LEAST INTERESTING ENOUGH TO CONVEY TO YOU THE REASON THEIR INTERESTING TO ME IS AGAIN NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR NAMES THESE MOLECULES WERE NOT MEASURED IN THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT THAT THEY ONCE AGAIN BRING US TO THE THEMES THAT WE ADDRESSED BEFORE WHICH ARE THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND WHETHER OR NOT IT TENDS TO BE SHIFTED MORE TOWARDS ALERTNESS IN ACTION OR MORE TOWARDS KIND OF A STABLE EQUILIBRIUM OR MORE TOWARDS KIND OF CALM AND WHETHER OR NOT INDIVIDUALS ARE SELECTING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS LIKE THEIRS BEFORE THEY EVEN MEET RIGHT SO A AGAIN GOING BACK TO THIS THE SE SAW ANALOGY IT'S ALMOST LIKE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE KND OF FLATS SE SAW ALERT BUT CALM BUT NOT EXTREMELY ALERT A NOT EXTR EMLY A OVERLY CALMIN IN SITUATIONS BUT KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE SEEM TO BE SEEKING OUT PEOPLE THAT ARE ALSO AT THAT KIND OF A AUTONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM A PEOPLE IN THE WHICH SHE CALL THE DOPOMING CATEGORY WHICSHIP REALLY CAN JUST BE DESCRIBED AS HIGH SENSATION SEEKING NOVELTY SEEKING THEY SEEM TO WANT O PAR WITH ONE ANOTHER SO THERES A SELECTION FOR SIMILAR IN TWO OF THE GROUPS AUTONOMIC TONE I FIND THAT VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THAT DECISION OR THAT PREFERENCE FOR SIMILAR AUTONOMIC TONE IT ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATES A LOT OF THE A THE REQUIREMENT FOR A FIGURING OUT HOW TO MATCH ONE'S AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TO ANOTHER THEY SIMPLY FINDS ONE WITH A SIMILAR TENDENCY OK WHEREAS IN THE OTHER TWO GROUPS THAT SHE CALL TESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN THE DIRECTER TYPE AND THE NURTURING KIND OF SOMEWHAT FOLLOWER TYPE THERE IS A A AN ESTABLISHMENT OF BALANCE BUT NOT IN THE INBETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS AS A MATCH BUT RATHER ON THE WHOLE IN THE RELATIONSHIP ONE PERSON IS KIND OF DRIVING THE NOVELTY SEEKING AND THE COURSE OF DECISIONS AND ACTIONS AND THE OTHER PERSON IS ESSENTIALLY AGREEING TO THOSE NOW ASSUMING THAT THOSE A DECISIONS ARE GOOD FOR FOR BOTH PEOPLE AND I EMPHASIZE GOOD FOR BOTH PEOPLE BECAUSE ONE OF THE THEMES THAT DOCTORFISHIP UNDER SCORES THAN I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE HERE AS WELL IS THAT IT NEED NOT BE THE CASE THAT PEOPLE PAR UP EXACTLY ACCORDING TO THESE CATEGRIZATIONS THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED DOPOMING MATOPOMIN CERATONAIT CERATONAN TESTOSTERON WITH ASTERTAN SO ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE BE A RECOGNITION AN A RESPECT FOR THE OTHER TYPES OR A RECOGNITION AND A RESPECT FOR THE FACT THAT BOTH ARE OF THE SAME TYPE YOU COULD ACTUALLY IMAGINE FOR INSTANCE THAT TWO PEOPLE OF THIS HIGH SENSATION SEEKING NOVELTY SEEKING A COULD HAVE A TERRIFICALLY EXCITING RELATIONSHIP BUT THAT IT ACTUALLY A MIGHT BE A RELATIONSHIP IN WITH IN WHICH O THE FINANCIAL STABILITY HISN'T QUITE THERE OR IN WHICH THE BASIC STABILITY ISN'T THERE A YOU COULD IMAGINE FOR INSTANCE A A SITUATION IN WHICH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE OF A WHACH SHE CALL THE HYSERATONEN A PREFERENCE WOULD HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS ACTILON KIND OF DULL IN WHICH BOTH OF THEM FOUND THEMSELVES KIND ABORD AT SOME POINT OR A IN WHICH THERE WASN'T ENOUGH OF DYTE OF THE DYNAMIC TENSION A THAT SOMETIMES IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO KEEP THIS THE CYCLE OF DESIRE LOVE AN ATTACHMENT GOING SOMETHING THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT SO THE POINT HERE IS NOT THAT ONE SHOULD NECESSARILY PARUP ACCORDING TO THE A THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT I DESCRIBED THE POINT IS THAT ON AVERAGE THAT'S WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN AND THAT THROUGH A RECOGNITION THAT THESE CATEGRIZATIONS EXIST SIMILAR TO THE RECOGNITION THAT THE TYPE A B C AND D INFANT AND TODDLER TYPE ATTACHMENTS EXIST THAT WE K IN GAIN BETTER SELF AWARENESS OF WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE TEND TO SHOW UP IN ROMANTIC ATTACHMENTS AND THEREBY NAVIGATE HEALTHIER MATE SEEKING HEALTHIER A BREAK UP IF IF THA THE CASE A DICTATES IT AND IN SOME CASES HEALTHY LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS BY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE OTHER PERSON CAN EITHER BE SIMILAR OR COMPLIMENTARY TO US ONE IS NEITHER BETTER THAN THE OTHER IT SIMPLY THE CASE THAT IN ALL ROMANTIC ATTACHMENTS FROM THE INITIAL INCEPTION OF THAT ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT DESIRE LOVE END ETACHMENT THERE IS AN AUTONOMIC CORDINATION AND OF COURSE THERE IS CORDINATION OF ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS LIKE A YOU KNOW A FOOD SECS AND SLEEP AND A FINANCES AND A WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIVE IN MANY OTHER FEATURES BUT THAT AT THE CORE OF ALL THAT IS A SEEKING OF EITHER AUTONOMIC LIKENESS OR AUTONOMIC DIFFERENCES AND I THINK THAT RECOGNITION CAN BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE IN THINKING ABOUT TOOLS TO ENTER AND MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS IF ONE THINKS ABOUT THEIR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM NOT SIMPLY AS SOMETHING THAT IS DRIVEN BY EXTERNAL PEOPLE AND EVENTS BUT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GAIN SOME CONTROL OVER THROUGH TECHNIQUES OF THE SORT THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND ON PREVIOUS PODCASTS BUT ALSO GENERALLY IF WE ARE ABLE TO A JUST OR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ORDER TO AT LEAST APPRECIATE OR GET SOME EMPATHY INTO WHAT SOME ONE ELSE'S EXPERIENCING THEN WE GAIN ACTUAL COGNITIVE EMPATHY AND THIS EPISODE ISN'T ABOUT EMPATHY PER SAY BUT THE THENE KEEPS COMING UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND I THINK IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT WHEN YOU TALK TO PSYCHOLOGISTS WHETHER NOT THEIR PSYCHOANOLESS OR FROM ANOTHER A SOURCE OF TRAINING WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT EMPATHY AS A GENERAL TERM THEY WILL TALK ABOUT EMOTIONAL EMPATHY THY'L TALK ABOUT COGNATIVE EMPATHY AND WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT HERE TO DAY IS YET A THIRD CATEGORY THAT IS TVERY STRONGLY DETERMINANT OF RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS AND THATS AUTONOMIC EMPATHY A'M A BIOLOGIST I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST SO I LOVE MECHANISM AND FORTUNATELY THERE ARE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE RECENTLY USING MOTERN TECHNIQUES TO LOOK AT NORAL MECHANISMS OF ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT I MENTIONED EARLIER SOME OF THE BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON CHILD AND MOTHER A LITERALLY IMAGING THE ACTIVITY OF NURANS IN THE BRAIN AS CHILD IS NURSING OR AS A MOTHERS SOOTHING BABY AND AS YOU LEARNED EARLIER BABY IS SOOTHING MOTHER AS WELL ON THOSE ARE REMARKABLE STUDIES YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF THESE PICTURES ON LINE YOU CAN SEE THE KIND OF SILHOUETT OF THE INFANT AND MOTHER AND THEIR BRAINS AND A EVENS ON THE BRAIN ACTAVATION PATTERNS REALLY REALLY BEAUTIFUL STUDIES SIMILAR STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE IN ROMANTIC COUPLES  WITH THOSE COUPLES EITHER TOUCHING ONE ANOTHER A TOUCHING AND KISSING OR A IN KIND OF CLEVER I THINK CONTROL EXPERIMENTS OF THE A PERSON JUST TOUCHING A PILLOW A OR SOMETHING OR KISSING A PILLOW A IN ORDER TO CHINE CREATE THE MOST A REASONABLE CONTROL FOR WHAT ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY COMPLICATED INTERPERSONAL DYNAMICS TO DO IN A BRAIN IMAGING SCANNER A BUT SOME OF THE OTHER STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE RECENTLY INVOLVED SO CALLED EE G SO THESE ARE ELECTRICAL RECORDINGS THAT ARE DONE NON INVASIVELY A PUTTING A BUNCH OF ELECTRODES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SCALP A E G IS USEFUL IN THAT YOU CAN A DO IT NOT INVASIVELY A YOU CAN DO IT A IN WHILE PEOPLE ARE MOVING AND DOING THINGS KISSING TOUCHING A ET CETERA A IT DOESN'NTO LOW ONE TO IMAGE OR TO EVALUATE NERAL ACTIVITY VERY DEEPLY IN THE BRAIN SO YOU CAN MISS OUT ON A LOT OF THINGS IT SOR OF LIKE LOOKING AT THE WAVE STRUCTURE ON THE OCEON WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOOKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE OF THE OCEAN SO YOU CAN MISS CERTAIN THINGS BUT IF YOU SEE THINGS A GENERALLY A YOU TRUST THEY ARE THERE BUT YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT YOU DON'T SEE NONE THE LESS A THERE ASE SOME STUDIES THAT ALL JUST POINT YOU TO A AND THAT FORM THE A SEDWAY FOR ONE I AM GOING TO A DISCUSSING IN A MOMENT WHICH IS A STUDY PUBLISHING SCIENTIFIC REPORTS A IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE A ENTITLED INVESTIGATING REAL LIFE EMOTIONS AND ROMANTIC COUPLES A MOBILE E G STUDIES SO THIS A IS AS THE A TITLE SUGGEST HAVING BEWARE THESE E G CAPS OF ELECTRODES A GET A ENGAGE IN VERY PASSIONATE EMOTIONAL KISSES A EMOTIONAL SPEECH TOWARD ONE ANOTHER STANDING AT DIFFERENT DISTANCE IS SO LOT OF A COOL STUFF THAT YOU CAN DO THAT YOU REALLY COULDN'T DO IN A BRAIN SCANTER A BECAUSE IN A BRAIN SCANTER PEOPLE HAVE TO BE THERE IN A USUALLY IN A BITE BAR THERE ACTUA DRAW RECT LIKE THIS IVE BEEN IN ONE OF THESE THINGS A IS NOT A LOT OF MOVING AROUND TO BE HAD LEAST NOT USING A THE CURRENT ECHNOLOGY IN ANY CASE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS A THERE IS A SHIFTING BRAIN WAVES BRAIN STATES A THINGS LIKE ALFA WAVES WHICH JUST A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY OF BRAINWAVES IN THE NEEL QUARTEX THE KIND O OUTER SHELL OF THE BRAIN JUST BENEATH ON THE SKULL AND IN PEOPLE THAT ARE KISSING OR IN PEOPLE THEIR ENGAGED IN ROMANTIC SPEECH OR  A I DIDN'T ACTUALLY A HEAR WHAT THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER BUT WHAT THE COUPLE SEEMS A EXCITING ROMANTIC AND AROUSING TO THEM A THEY SEE MORE ALFUL WAVE ACTIVITY COMPARED TO THE CONTROL CONDITIONS AND THERE WAS SOME A WHAT WE CALL LATERALIZATION WHERE THE LEFT THEMISPHERE WAS MORE ACTIVE THAN THE RIGHT AND SO FORTH A AND THESE STUDIES ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS OF INDIVIDUALS TEN TO START TO COLLABORATE AND ACTUALLY SYNCRONIZE AT THE LEVEL OF HEART BEATS AT THE LEVEL OF BREATHING A DURING ROMANTIC INTERACTIONS OF DIFFERENT KINDS BUT THESE STUDIES ARE SOME OF THE FIRST OF THEIR KIND TO START LOOKING AT NURL SYNCRANIZATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS NOW THE SIMPLE A VERSION OF LOOKING AT THIS AND THE WAY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS WOULD ALL GO WAS O K TO PEOPLE START KISSING THEY START TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY F INE PARTICULARLY ROMANTIC AND AROUSING FOR THEM AND THE BRAINWAYS WILL JUST MATCH TO ONE ANOTHER AND A THAT'S REALLY THE BASIS OF ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT AND ROMANTIC ENGAGEMENT O IN THAT SORT OF THING BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE SO A REALLY NI STUDY PUBLISHING IN A REALLY FINE JOURNAL A CEREBRAL QUARTEX IS A JOURNAL THAT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT FOR MANY YEARS THEY PUBLISH STRONG ANATEMY PHYSIOLOGY AND ER IMAGING AM THERE'S A A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED FIRST AUTHOR CAGI MURA AM IN AND THIS PAPER REALLY POINTS A AGAIN THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE TITLE THIS PAPER IS BRAIN KNOWS WHO IS ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH RESTING STATE CONACTIVITY CAN PREDICT COMPATIBILITY OF FEMALE MALE RELATIONSHIP NOW WHAT THIS STUDY DID WAS A LITTLE BUT DIFFERENT THEY LOOKED AT THE RESTING OR DEFAULT MODE ACTIVITY OF THE BRAIN SO RATHER THAN EVOKED ACTIVITY AS IT'S CALLED WHERE PEOPLE ARE KISSING OR A ENGAGED IN SOME SORT OF ACTIVITY THIS WAS A NEURO IMAGING STUDY AM NOT E G BUT EFHEMORI FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESIDENTS IMAGING WHICH IS SIMILAR TO TO E G IN PRINCIPLE BUT ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK DEEP INTO THE BRAIN AND IT HAS A VERY GOOD RESOLUTION IN TIME AND SPACE SO FAST EVENTS CAN BE MONITORD AND A THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THOSE EVENTS CAN BE MONITORED A SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN E G THAT THEIR EXCEPTIONS TO THE SO FOR YOU E GEARS OUT THEIR E G AM DON'TA DON'T COME AFTER ME WITH A ELECTRODES JUST UNDERSTAND THAT EPHEMORI A GIVES YOU A FULLER PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT CACUMURA AT ALL FOUND WAS THAT CONTRARY TO WHAT A YOUR REFLECTIVE PREDICTION MIGHT BE PEOPLE TEND TO SELECT PEOPLE THAT HAVE RESTING BRAIN STATES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THEIRS ARE SOMETIMES THEY FOUND THAT ARE ACTUALLY OPPOSITE TO THEIR OWN RESTING BRAIN STATE AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE ITHO THIS IS ALL ABOUT AUTANOMIC A CORDINATION BUT ACTUALLY IF WE GO BACK TO HELEN FISSURES CATEGRIZATIONS OF THE THE DOPOMINE TYPES THE SENSATION SEEKING TYPES THAT IS  CERETONEIN THE KIND OF A STABLE RULE FOLLOWING TYPES TUSTOSTRON AND ESTERGANTYPES REMEMBER THAT THE TWO CATEGORIES THAT SHE CALL TESTOSTRON ESTRIGEN TYPE THE DIRECTOR IN THE AND THE FOLLOWER TE NURTURE I GUESS IT WOULD BE THE MORE ACCURATEWAY THE DIRECTOR IN THE NURTUR THOSE TEND TO PAR UP ACROSS CATEGORIES NOT WITHIN CATEGORY AND SO I THINK WHAT'S REALLY NEEDED FOR THIS FIELD WHICH TO MY KNOWLEDGE HASN'T HAPPENED YET IS TO REALLY STAR TO MAP THE NEURANATOMICAL AND NEURO PHYSIOLOGICAL FINDINGS OF IN THIS CASE THAT RESTING BRAIN STATE IS IN ONE FORM IN ONE INDIVIDUAL AND THEY TEND TO SEEK OUT PEOPLE WHOSE RESTING BRAIN STATE IS DIFFERENT THAN THEIRS NOT SIMILAR THAT NEEDS TO BE MAPPED ON TO THE MORE SUBJECTIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGRIZATIONS THAT HELEN FISURE AND INDEED THE GOPMEN S AND OTHERS HAVE CREATED THE SORT OF THE STATE OF THE FIELD NOW AND I MENTION THIS NOT TO CONFUSE YOU BUT TO THE CONTRARY TO ILLUSTRATE THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FINDING SOME ONE JUST LIKE YOU AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FINDING SOME ONE WHOSE OPPOSITE TO YOU THIS IS ACTHUALLY THE REASON THAT I DECIDE TO BECOME A BIOLOGIST AT SOME POINT IN MY LIFE WHICH IS THAT WE CAN FIND VERBAL SAYINGS AND STORIES AND EXAMPLES TO SUPPORT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ITS THIS IS NOT A KNOCK ON THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL FROM TO DAY'S EPOSOTE IAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR IN REVERENCE FOR THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY ESPECIALLY A IT'S COLLABORATION WITH ANOR SCIENCE IN VICE OVERSA BUT IN THE POPULAR CULTURE WE CAN FIND EXAMPLES AND SAYINGS THAT SUPPORT IT ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING AS IT RELATES TO A RELATIONSHIP FOR INSTANCE OF I'VE HEARD AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER AND INDEED I'VE EXPERIENCE THAT AND I BELIEVE IT'S TRUE BUT I ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCED AND I BELIEVE TO BE TRUE THAT OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND ALSO EXISTS AND THAT THERE WILL BE A BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM FOR THAT THE POINT HERE IS THAT MATCHING OF SAME TO SAYING OR SAME TO DIFFERENT CAN BOTH BE EFFECTIVE IN CREATING THE DESIRE LOVE ATTACHMENT PROCESS IT'S A MATTER OF WHO IS LOOKING FOR SAME AND WHO IS LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT AND THERE I THINK A DOCTOR FISHER AND THE WORK OF THESE NER PHYSIOLOGISTS AN BRAIN IMAGERS REALLY DOES POINT IN A DIRECTION WHEREBY THERE IS NOT ONE FORM OF ATTACHMENT THAT IS GOING TO BE WHOLLY ABOVE ALL ELSE IN WILL PREDICT GOOD OUTCOMES THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A CASE IN WHICH OPPOSITES ATTRACT AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE BEST RULE TO FOLLOW SOMETIMES IT WILL SOMETIMES IT WON'T THERE IS ALSO NOT THE CASE THAT PEOPLE TEND TO PAIR UP WITH SIMILAR SOMETIMES IT WILL BE THE CASE SOMETIMES IT WON'T NOW THERE ARE CERTAIN STATISTICS THAT SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE ON AVERAGE PEOPLE PAR UP WITH INDIVIDUALS OF SIMILAR EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND INCOMMON ATTRACTIVENESS THAT IS TRUE ON AVERAGE BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND AGAIN A KNOWLEDGE OF AND A RESPECT FOR THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIZATIONS OF ATTACHMENT THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIZATIONS OF MATE SEEKING DESCRIBED BY FISSURE AN OTHERS AND THE RECOGNITION THAT MATCHING OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS BUT ALSO MISMATCHING OF RESTING STATE BRAIN NETWORKS ARE ALL AT PLAY IN DRIVING WHAT WE ARE CALLING DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT SO IN KEEPING WITH THE EXPLORATION OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S A SAYING OR A BOOK OR A SONG OR AN EXAMPLE OF PRETTY MUCH ANY RELATIONSHIP DYNAMIC I WANTED NOW TALK ABOUT AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT A LITTLE OVER TEN YEARS AGO THAT TALKED ABOUT THE UNIFERSE SALIDY OF LOVE AND THE ABILITY TO FALL IN LOVE SO THIS WOULD BE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE GEORGE BERNARD SHAW QUOTE THAT I MENTION EARLIER THAT A LOVE IS REALLY OVERESTIMATING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND AGAIN I SHOULD SAY THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY BELIEVE ALTHOUGH MAYBE I 'M JIST DELUDING MYSELF I LIKE TO THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WE FALL IN LOVE WITH A A RE LY SPECIAL FOR US THAT THEY COULD NOT EASILY BE REPLACED WITH ANYBODY ELSE A THAT SIMPLY MY STANDS ON NOT BASING THAT ON ANY A HARD COURD INOROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISM A BUT A NONE THE LESS AN ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN THE NEWR TIMES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT RELATED TO SOME PSYCHOLOGICL STUDIES THAT WERE DONE AS WELL AS SOME CLINICAL WORK AS WELL AS SOME I WHAT I WOULD CALL A POPPSYCHOLOGY ORE THINGS THAT FALL OUTSIDE THAT THE DOMAINS OF ACADEMIC SCIENCE AND THE THE WHOLE BASIS OF THIS ARTICLE WAS A THIRTY SIX QUESTIONS THAT LEAD TO LOVE AND IT INVOLVED A LISTING OUT INDEED OF THIRTY SIX QUESTIONS SET DIVIDED INTO SET ONE SET TO AND SET THREE THAT PROGRESS FROM SOMEWHAT ORDINARY QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE EXPERIENCE A AND SELF REPORT TO MORE A LET'S CALL THEM DEEP QUESTIONS ABOUT PEOPLES A VALUES AND AND THINGS THAT ARE EMOTIONALLY CLOSE TO THEM AN I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A FEW OF THESE YOUCON FIND THIS EASILY ON LINE BY JUST A PUTTING INTO YOUR SEARCH ENGIN THIRTY SIX QUESTIONS THAT LEAD LOVE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IN SET NUMBER ONE WERE A FOR INSTANCE WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A PERFECT DAY FOR YOU A A FOR WHAT YOUR LIFE DO YOU FEEL MOST GRATEFUL CONSTANDARED QUESTION OUR STUFF IN SET TO A WHAT IS YOUR MOST TREASURED MEMORY A WAS YOUR MOST TERRIBLE MEMORY SO THESE ARE E AS YOU CAN TELL AR DRILLING A LIT BIT DEEPER INTO ONE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND AND EMOTIONAL SYSTEM AND THEN SET THREE QUESTIONS TWENTY FIVE A THROUGH THIRTY SIX  ARE THINGS A YOU KNOW  WHAT IS AT A VERY EMBARRASSING MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE A WHEN DID YOU LAST CRY IN FRONT OF ANOTHER PERSON AND BY YOURSELF A WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S TWO SERIOUS TO BE JOKED ABOUT SO IT'S GOING A DEEPER INTO A ONCE EMOTIONAL SYSTEM AND A EVEN QUESTIONS LIKE OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR FAMILY WHOSE DEATH WOULD YOU FIND MOST DISTURBING AND WHY SA PRETTY PRETTY HEAVY STUFF THERE AT THE END NOW THE REASON THIS ARTICLE GOT SO MUCH TRACTION AND THE REASON ON BRINGING UP TO DAY IS THAT THERE WAS A STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE IN AND AROUND THIS ARTICLE THAT IF TWO PEOPLE WENT ON A DATE OR SIMPLY SAT DOWN AND ASKED EACH OTHER THESE QUESTIONS AND EACH ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AND THE OTHER WAS PAYING ATTENTION CAREFULLY AND AT SOME LEVEL EMOTIONALLY RESPONDING OR NOT RESPONDING BUT CERTAINLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ANSWERS OF THE OTHER PERSN THAT BY THE END OF THAT EXCHANGE WHERE ONE PERSON ASKS THIRTY SIX QUESTIONS IN THE OTHER PERSON ANSWERS ALL THIRTY SIX AND THEN THE OTHER PERSON ASK ALL THIRTY SIX IN THE OTHER PERSON ANSWERS ALL THIRTY SIX THAT THEY WOULD FALL IN LOVE RIGHT WHICH SEEMS IT LIKE H ANOF A RIDICULOUS THING AND YET IT IS THE CASE THAT PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH THIS EXERCISE REPORT FEELING AS IF THEY KNOW THE OTHER PERSON QUITE WELL AND FEELING CERTAIN A L VILS OF ATTACHMENT OR EVEN LOVE AND DESIRE FOR THE OTHER PERSON THAT THEY WERN WOULD NOT HAVE PREDCTED EXCUSE ME WOULD NOT HAVE PREDICTED A HAV THEY NOT GON THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS EXCHANGE OF QUESTIONS AN ANSWERS OF A PROGRESSIVELY MORE EMOTIONAL AND DEEP LEVEL WELL WHAT I PREDICTIS GOING ON IS THAT INSIDE OF THAT EXCHANGE PEOPLE ARE CREATING A SORT OF DELUSIONAL STORY ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE EXCHANGE BEING A REFLECTION OF SOME DEEPER ATTACHMENT AND SO EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE ARE JUST EXCHANGING WORDS THEY ARE NOT A PHYSICALLY TOUCHING THEY ARE NOT AT LEAST NOT AT THE POINT WHERE THER RUNNING THESE KINDS OF A QUESTION OR STUDIES A THEY MAY TOUCH AFTERWARDS FOR ALL I KNOW AND PROBABLY DID IN SOME CASES BUT THEYARE NOT EXCHANGING LIFE EXPERIENCE IN AN IMMEDIATE WAY THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY GOING OFF INTO THE WORLD AND DOING THINGS TOGETHER YET THEY ARE SIMPLY EXCHANGING NARRATIVE BUT WE KNOW BASED ON RECENT STUDIES AND I'AVE COVERED THIS BEFORE ON THIS POD CASPITAL MENTION AGAIN THERE WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED IN SELL REPORTS A SELPRES JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOWING THAT WHEN INDIVIDUALS LISTEN TO THE SAME NARRATIVE THEIR HEART RATES TEND TO SNCRONIZE OR AT LEAST FOLLOW A VERY SIMILAR PATTERN EVEN IF THEY RE NOT IN THE SAME ROOM LISTENING TO A GIVEN NARRATIVE WHEREAS IN THIS CASE PEOPLE ARE FACING ONE ANOTHER LISTENING TO THE NARRATIVES OF EACH OTHER CERTAINLY THEY ARE HAVING AUTONOMIC RESPONSES AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEIR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS ARE SYNCHRONIZING MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE SELL REPORT STUDY FOUND THAT PEOPLE WILL SYNCRONIZE THEIR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS TO A SHARED HEARD STORY FROM ANOTHER IN OTHER WORDS WHETHER NOT WE HEAR A STORY WATCHAMOVI LISTEN TO A SONG OR EXCHANGE OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL STORIES OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MAP ON TO ONE ANOTHER SO I'M NOT ALL THAT SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE FIND THAT THEY FALL IN LOVE IN QUOTES AM AFTER ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY THE WAY THESE QUESTIONS ARE LAID OUT IS THEY ESTABLISH A NARRATIVE THEY ESTABLISH A VERY PERSONAL NARRATIVE AND THE OTHER PERSON IS LISTENING VERY CLOSELY AND WE DON'T HAVE PHYSIOLOGICAL OR BRANIMAGING STUDIES TO A TO SUPPORT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY BUT THE THE REASONABLE INTERPRETATION IS THAT THAT'S CAUSING SOME SORT OF AUTONOMIC SYNCRANIZATION SO IF YOU WANT TO TRY THIS ON A DAT TOR EVEN A ZASHIBEN A HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS COULD BE USEFUL FOR EXISTING COUPLES A AEVEN IF THEY ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER SY SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AND THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME EITHER I THINK THE AUTONOMIC CORNATION IS PRESENT DURING MADING BEHAVIOR ITS PRESENT DURING SHARED EXPERIENCE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD MOVIES CONCERTS A WATCHING ONE'S CHILDREN WITH SOMEBODY ELSE ET CETERA AND IT'S ESTABLISHED BY SHARING ONE'S OWN NARRATIVE OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE SO I DON'T WANT TO SEEM OVERLY REDUCTIONIST I'LL NEVER PROPOSE THAT ALL OF OUR OUR SENSATION PERCEPTION ACTION IN EXPERIENCE IN LIFE BOILS DOWN TO  US JUST BEING BAGS OF CHEMICALS THAN THE ACTION OF THOSE CHEMICALS OR ANY ASPECT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND YET IN LOOKING ACROSS THE PSYCCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE OF DEVELOPMENT OF ATTACHMENT IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE OF ADULT AND ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT AND WHAT MAKES AND BREAKS THOSE ATTACHMENTS IT'S VERY CLEARE TO ME AND I THINK COURSES THROUGH THE LITERATURE MULTIBLE LEVELS THAT AUTONOMIC CORDINATION IS ABSOLUTELY KEY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIRE LOVE AN ATTACHMENT IN FACT I TALKED EARLIER ABOUT HOW OUR ACTUAL CONCEPTION IS BORN OUT OF AUTONOMIC CORDINATION OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER SO AGAIN IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS ALWAYS BE SYNCHRONIZED IN THE CASE OF THE TWO CATEGRIZATIONS THAT FISH ARE PROPOSED OF THE DIRECTOR SLASH TUSTOSTERONE TYPE IN THE OF THE NURTURING OF FOLLOWER SLASH ESTERGEN TYPE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE CORDINATION BUT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT FALL INTO EACH OF THOSE TATEGORIES THAT LED TO MORE STABLE ATTACHMENTS OR THE SEEKING OUT OF THOSE ATTACHMENTS I SHOULD SAY BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S IT LEAST TO MY MIND VERY CLEAR THAT AUTONOMIC CORDINATION IS A HALMARED FEATURE OF DESIRE A HALMARKED FEATURE OF WHAT WE CALL LOVE END A HALMARKED FEATURE OF WHAT WE CALL ATTACHMENT AND THAT THE BREAKING OF ATTACHMENTS ERE THE FAILURE OF DESIRE THE FAILURES OF LOVE AND THE FAILURES OF ATTACHMENT OVER TIME IN LINE WITH THE WORK OF GOP MEN AND OTHERS AND IMEVEN JUST SIMPLY WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR MATING BEHAVIOR IS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT IN THAT CASE A FAILURE TO CORDINATE THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS IN SOME SORT OF CONSERTED WAY ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT WOULD BE INCOMPLETE IF WE DIDN' TALK ABOUT THE DREADED INFIDELITY AND CHEATING YET MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF INFIDELITY IN CHEATING AND WETHER NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGHER ON DOPOMINE AND SENSATION SEEKING TEND TO CHEAT MORE OR LESS FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SOLID EVIDENCE FOR THAT O I THINK THERE ARE LOT OF EXAMPLES THAT WE CAN DRAW FROM IN OUR OWN LIVES AND O IN THE LIVES OF OTHERS THAT WOULD GENERALLY SUPPORT ONE OR THE OTHER MODEL BUT I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DECENT PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES OR PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDES THAT REALLY POINT TO THAT OF FOR INSTANCE I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT OF THE PSERTONERGIC PENATYPE AS DESCRIBED BY FISHURE OF IS LESS PRONE TO CHEAT OR THAT THE A YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INSECURE ATTACHMENT OR AR MORE LIKELY TO CHEAT ITS AT FOR INSTANCE OF I DON'T THINK THOSE CORELATIONS HAVE BEEN DRAWN IN ANY KIND OF MEANINGFUL WAY YET SO I BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT OF ASSIGNING THEM WITHOUT THAT EVIDENCE HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING STUDIES INVOLVING AGAIN NEURO IMAGING AND SOME SUBJECTIVE MEASURES IN HUMAN'S MEANING ASKING THEM QUESTIONS HAT A THEIR GOOD WAYS TO TEAS OUT LIES FROM TRUTHS AND IN THESE SORTS OF STUDIES AND WHETHER NOT PEOPLE TEND TO FIND THEIR PARTNER OR OTHERS MORE OR LESS ATTRACTIVE DEPENDING ON HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THEMSELVES AND I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING ASPECT TO DESIRE LOVE IN ATTACHMENT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON YOU HEAR A LOT OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO FORM A REALLY STRONG RELATIONSHIP A YOU HEFT T HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH YOURSELF OR YOU HAVE TO LOVE YOURSELF OR A YOU OFTEN HEARE FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S EXACTLY WHEN YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU'RE GOINGTO FINE WHEN YOU HEAR THE STUFF RIGHT BUT NONE OF THAT IS REALLY GROUNDED IN ANY STUDIES AGAIN THAT'S LIKE OUT OF SIDE OUT OF MINE OR ABSENCE MAKES THE HARTFONDER THERE THERE RE MANY LIFE EXAMPLES TO SUPPORT ON THOSE A STATEMENTS AND THEIRE MANY TE LIFE EXAMPLES TO SUPPORT STATEMENTS TO THE OPPOSITE THERE'S A PARTICULAR STUDY THAT I FOUND THIS WAS PUBLISH IN FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY BUT IT'S A EXPERIMENTAL STUDY THAT INVOLVES  NER IMAGING THE TITLE TO STUDY IS MANIPULATION OF SELF EXPANSION ALTERS RESPONSES TO ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE PARTNERS AND I LOVE THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY WHAT THEY DID IN THE STUDY IS THEY TOOK COUPLES AND THEY AVALUATED MEMBERS OF THAT RELATIONSHIP FOR WHAT'S CALLED SELF EXPANSION NOW SELF EXPANSION IS A METRIC THAT INVOLVES ONCE PERCEPTION OF SELF AS SEEN THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE OTHER AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY A THAT THE AUTHORS ARE ERRAN AND ERRAND SO THEY AVETHE SAME LAST NAME SO AM ASSUMING THIS WAS EITHER A SIBLING TEAM OR SOMEHOW RELATED TEAM WERE OR A ROMANTIC COUPLE TEAM A THEY ARE O AND A AND THEY ARE OAN ERRAN AND ERRAND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX PROPOSE THE SELF EXPANSION MODEL OF CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY PROPOSE THAT PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED TO ENTER RELATIONSHIPS ON READING HERE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE SELF AND INCREASE SELF EFFICACY IN OTHER WORDS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MANY PEOPLE INTER RELATIONSHIPS IS THAT IT MAKES US FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES IN MORE CAPABLE AND I WOULD SEE THAT AS A HEALTHY INTERDEPENDENCE NOT NECESSARILY CODEPENDENCE THIS IS E SPECIALLY STRONG AT THE BEGINNING OF A RELATIONSHIP IT TURNS OUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE FORMING PARBONDS AND IT'S THE CASE THAT PLEASURE AROUSAL AND EXCITEMENT AGAIN ALL HULLMARKE FEATURES OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION PLEASURE AROUSAL AN EXCITEMENT GIVE RISE TO SELF EXPANSION MEANING TO SELF EFFICACY SO WHAT THIS SELF EXPANSION MODELS REALLY ABOUT IS HOW GREAT OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE ARE CLOSE TO IN ROMANTICALLY ATTACHED YOU CAN POTENTIALLY MAKE US FEEL IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY SAY IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY DO IN TERMS OF THE WAY IN WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY FEEL ABOUT US SO IT DOESN'T NECSSARILY HAVE TO INVOLVE EXPLICIT STATEMENTS OF ON THEM TELLING US HOW GREAT WE ARE OR THEM DOING GREAT GESTURES FOR US BUT HOW WE ACTUALLY FEEL THEY FEEL ABOUT US TURNS OUT TO BE VERY STRONG PERAMETER IN TERMS OF HOW WE FEEL ABOUT OURSELVES AND THE RELATIONSHIP OVER ALL NOW SOME OF YOU OUT THERE ARE PROBABLY THINKING O YE ISN'T THER THIS THING OF THE LOVE LANGUAGES RIGHT I DON'T HAVE ANY NERR SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THAT I THINK THE LOVE LANGUAGES IA'RME NOT SUPER FAMILIAR WITH THIS I DENTLISTED OUT BUT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE OF THEIR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IF YOU WILL ON TENDS TO BE VERY RESPONSIVE TO GIFTS OR TO A QUALITY TIME OR TO PHYSICAL TOUCH OR ACTS OF KIND OF SONE THING HAVE GOUT A FEW OF THESE RIGHT UPPROR THEY AVE A FEW WRONG ANYWERE THERE EASY TO FIND ON LINE AND PEOPLE DO TEND TO HAVE A KIND OF ABIAS TOWARD TWO OR THREE OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE SPECIALLY MEANINGFUL FOR THEM AND WHEN I HEAR MEANING FUL I HEAR THEY TEND TO PUSH THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NER CHEMICAL SYSTEMS OF THE RAIN EMBODY IN A DIRECTION THAT MAKES US FEEL GOOD AS SUPPOSE TO LOUSY OR NEUTRAL IN ANY EVENT THIS STUDY LOOKED AT WHETHER R NOT PEOPLE HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF SELF EXPANSION THROUGH THE ACTIONS OR STATEMENTS OF THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER AND HOW THAT INFLUENCES THEIR PERCEPTION OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE RELATIONSHIP MEANING HOW ATTRACTIVE THEY PERCEIVE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE RELATIONSHIP TO BE TURNS OUT TO BE STRONGLY INFLUENCE BY AY WHETHER OR NOT THEIR SELF EXPANSION IS VERY STRONGLY DRIVEN BY THE OTHER PERSON THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED WITH THAT THERE IN THE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH AND WHETHER NOT THAT'S BEING EXPRESSE TO THEM SO HEARE'S OUT THE STUDY WENT FIRST OF ALL THEY RATED OR CATEGARIZED INDIVIDUALS ON THE BASIS OF THE SELF EXPANSION METRIC SOME PEOPLE HAVE MORE OF A POTENSIAL TO EXPERIENCE SELF EXPANSION THROUGH OTHERS RIGHT SOME OF US FEEL GREAT ABOUT OURSELVES AND WORK CONT O TOPED OFF AT THE OTHERS DON'T FEEL SO GREAT ABOUT THEMSELVES BUT THEY CAN FEEL MUCH BETTER IN RESPONSE TO PRAISE IN PARTICULAR PRAISE OR SELF EXPANSION TYPE ON BEHAVIORS OR STATEMENTS FROM PEOPLE THAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT AND STILL OTHER PEOPLE ARE A MIXTURE OF THE TWO THE KIND OFMODERATE LEVELS OF BOTH SO THEY RATED THEM ON THE SCALE AND THEN THEY HAD PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SELF EXPANSION NARRATIVES THEY HEARD THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER SAY REALLY TERRIFIC THINGS ABOUT THEM AND ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP IN PARTICULAR THAT THE RELATIONSHIP O THAT THEY HAVE WAS EXCITING NOVEL AND CHALLENGING SO THAT WAS ONE FORM OF SELF EXPANSION AND THEY WENT INTO SOME DETAIL AS TO WHY THAT WAS THE CASE IN THEIR PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP OR THEY HEARD A NARRATIVE FROM US FROM THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER ABOUT STRONG FEELINGS OF LOVE BETWEEN THE TWO THAT HAD BEEN EXPERIENCED PREVIOUSLY IN THE RELATIONSHIP SO IN THE ONE CASE IT SORT OF DIRECTED MORE TOWARDS THEM AND IN THE OTHER CASE IT'S MORE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP ITSELF AND THEN THEY DID BRAIN IMAGING OF ONE OF PERSON IN THE RELATIONSHIP WHILE THAT PERSON ASSESS THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE RELATION SHIP AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE PRIMED FOR THIS SELF EXPANSION HAD LOWER ACTIVATION OF BRAINARIAS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSESSING OTHERS ATTRACTIVENESS THEN DID THE PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED A LOT OF SELF EXPANSION NOW THE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT AT LEAST THE WAY I READ THI STUDY IS IF YOU'RE WITH SOMEBODY WHO REALLY BENEFITS FROM OR EXPERIENCE IS A LOT OF SELF EXPANSION UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT THEM TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OTHER PEOPLE IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE SELF EXPANSION TYPE GESTURES OR STATEMENTS NOT SO MUCH CENTERED ON THE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT RELATIONSHIP THEIR SO MUCH LOVE ITS SO GREAT THAT TOO BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS STUDY IN THESE FINDINGS THAT THE PERSON IS REALLY TERRIFIC THAT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY'VE CREATED TOGETHER IS REALLY EXCITING NOVEL IN CHALLENGING THAT THERE'S A NARRATIVE AROUND THE RELATIONSHIP THAT REALLY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS IN PARTICULAR THAT THE PERSON WHO REALLY LIKE SELF EXPANSION IS VIGTAL TO THAT DYNAMIC MOCA SO IT'S NOT LOOKING DOWN AT THE RELATIONSHIP AS A SAID OF EQUALS THERE IS SORT OF THIS BIAS WRITTEN INTO THIS OF THAT THIS PERSON IS REALLY ESSENSIAL FOR THE RELATIONSHIP UNLOSAING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ANYONE HAS TO DO ONLESSING THIS IS RIGHT OR WRONG THAS JUST WHAT THE DATA SAY BUT WHAT'S REMARKABLE IS THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THOSE STATEMENTS PEOPLE WHO HAVE OR THAT RATE HIGH ON THIS SCALE OF SELF EXPANSION RATE ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE PARTNERS AS MORE ATTRACTIVE NOW THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THEIR ACTUAL PERCEPTION OF OTHERS IS CHANGING IT'S NOT THAT THEIRE OPPORTUNITYIES SEE OTHERS IS CHANGING RIGHT THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF THEM SOMEHOW GETTING ACCESS OR NO ACCESS TO ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE PARTNERS AGAIN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNAPARTNERS LITERALLY THE LANGUAGE IN THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER THEIR STILL SEEING ALL THESE ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE IT'S JUST THAT IF THEIR FEELING FILLED UP A INERQUOTES A PSYCHOLOGICALLY FILLED UP EMOTIONALLY FILLED UP AUTONOMICALLY FILLED A INHANCED A IN IN THE LANGUAGE THAT WERE USING TO DAY BY THIS SELF EXPANSION NARRATIVE WILL THEN THET SAME SET OF ATTRACTIVE FACES APPEAR LESS ATTRACTIVE TO A GIVEN INDIVIDUAL NOW WHETHER NOT THIS PREDICTS CHEATING OR LOYALTY A I CERTAINLY CAN'T SAY THAT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO ASESSIN IT IN NUR IMAGING AND THERE OF COURSE PEOPLE OF RARELY A IF EVER REPORT ACCURATELY A THEIR CHEATING BEHAVIOR THER SOME STUDIES IN WHICH A CONFIDENTIALITY IS ASSURED TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE MORE TRUSTING AND WILLING TO REVEAL A CHEATING BEHAVIOR BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS ON CHEATING BEHAVIORS VERY HARD TO TRACT BECAUS PEOPLE LIE ALL THE TIME ABOUT THEIR CHEATING IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT OF OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND NURO IMAGING STUDIES BUT I FIND THIS STUDY AGAIN THE TITLE MANIPULATION OF SELF EXPANSION ALTERS RESPONSES TO ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATE PARTNERS TO BE ABSOLUTELY FAST INATING BECAUSE AGAIN IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE INTERACTIONS WITH OUR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS SHAPES OUR AUTONOMIC ARALSAL SHAPES OUR PERCEPTION OF SELF AND THEREBY SHAPES OUR PERCEPTION OF OTHER POTENTIAL PARTNERS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD OR SHUTS US DOWN TO THE POTENTIAL OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD SO WHEN I HEAR STATEMENTS SUCH AS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU LOVE YOURSELF IN ORDER TO REALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE OR IT IS WHEN ONE IS NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP THAT THEIR MOST LIKELY TO FALL IN LOVE AND FORM A STABLERE RELATIONSHIP I CAN FILTER THAT THROUGH THESE FINDINGS TO SAY THAT IT'S REALLY THE PERSON WHO NEEDS A LOT OF SELF EXPANSION STIMULATING STATEMENTS OR ACTIONS COMING FROM OTHER PEOPLE THAT IS MOST PRONE TO SEEING OTHER POTENTIAL PARTNERS OUT IN THE WORLD AS ATTRACTIVE AND IN THIS SENSE WE CAN RETURN TO THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AS KIND OF A AS KIND OF A A GLASS THAT IT CAN BE FILLED UP THROUGH VARIOUS CONTACTS IT CAN BE FILLED UP THROUGH OUR OWN ABILITY TO REGULATE IT IT CAN BE FILLED UP THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO ENHANCE OUR SENSE OF WELL BEING AND IN SOME SENSE THIS POINTS TO AN IDEA WHERE IT IS TRUE THAT THE BETTER THAT WE CAN FEEL ABOUT OURSELVES IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY SELF EXPANSION TYPE A IN PUT FROM SOMEBODY ELSE REALLY DOES PLACE US ON MORE STABLE GROUND SUCH THAT WHEN WE DO RECEIVE THAT PRAISE OR WE DO RECEIVE THOSE ACTS OF KINDNESS OR SERVICE OR PHYSICAL TOUCH OR WHATEVER THEY ARE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE WAY THAT WE FEEL BUT THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY TETHER ALL OF OUR FEELINGS OF SELF WORTH OR SELF EXPANSION TO THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL SO YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IF PERSON A CAN ONLY RECEIVE THE SELF EXPANSION FROM THE STATEMENTS FROM THE ACTION OF THE PERSON THERE INVOLVED WITH PERSON BE THAT THAT WILL FORM A VERY STABLE BOND BUT WHAT THIS STUDY POINTS TO IS THE FACT THAT THAT'S A VERY UNSTABLE BOND THAT PERSON A IS ACTUALLY VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OTHERS BECAUSE THERE SO DESPERATELY ATTACHED TO THIS NOTION OF SELF EXPANSION EVEN IF THEY DON'T REALIZE IT AND SO THIS RALLY DOES POINT TO THE IDEA THAT WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT TO LINK OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS TO ESTABLISH DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT THAT WE WANT TO HAVE A STABLE INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF OURSELVES A STABLE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TO SOME DEGREE ANOTHER SO THAT WE CAN BE IN STABLE ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIP WITH ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL IF THAT'S WHAT WERE REALLY TRYING TO DO SO UNTIL NOW I HAVE BEEN WEAVING TOGETHER STUDIES FROM THE FIELD OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE FEELDS OF NERAL SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR NERO IMAGION BUT IF RECALL BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WHEN I WAS DISCUSSING HOW ODORS AND HOW HORMONES AND HOW EVEN BIRTH CONTROL CAN SHAPE PEOPLE'S RADINGS OF ATTRACTIVENESS OF OTHERS YOU'LL REALIZE THAT THERE IS A DEEPER LAYER TO ALL THIS WHICH IS THAT OUR BIOLOGY THAT RESIDES BELOW ORE CONSCIOUS AWARENESS THINGS LIKE OUR HORMONS THINGS LIKE FAIRMONES EVEN OR SHAPING THE WAY THAT WE CHOOSE INTERPRET AN ACT WITH OTHER POTENTIAL ROMANTIC PARTNERS OR THER ROMANTIC PARTNERS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE NOW THIS CANNOT BE OVER EMPHASIZED NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A SORT OF TOP DOWN DESCRIPTION MEANING FROM THE CORTACS IN ARE UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS ON TO WHAT WE FIND ATTRACTIVE WHO WE FIND ATTRACTIVE WHAT WE ENJOY WHAT WE DON'T ENJOY IN THE PURSUIT IN A ROMANTIC INTERACTIONS WITH OTHERS THERE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE AND INDEED THERE ALWAYS IS A DEEPER LAYER IN WHICH OUR SUBCONSCIOUS PROCESSING DRIVES US TO FIND A PARTICULAR PERSON TO BE PARTICULAR ATTRACTIVE OR IN WHICH WE HAVE CHEMISTRY WITH SOMEBODY OR IN WHICH WE LACK CHEMISTRY WITH SOMEBODY AND I WOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THEM ORE EXCITING FASCINATING AND INDEED MYSTERIOUS ASPECTS OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT ARE THOSE SUBCONSCIOUS PROCESSES THOSE THINGS THAT WE CALL CHEMISTRY I OIN PEOPLE WILL REPORT FOR INSTANCE THAT SOMEBODY SMELL IS JUST ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY INTOXICATING FOR THEM OR THAT SOMEBODY SMELL IS ABSOLUTLY REPULSIVE TO THEM AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THAT THE TASTE OF SOME ONE'S BREATH AND I DON'T MEAN THAT IN ANY KIND OF UNPOETIC SENSE I LITERALLY MEAN THE TASTE OF SOMEBODY'S BREATH IN SOME CASES CAN BE VERY EXCITING TO SOMEBODY AND BELIEVE ARE NOT WE CAN TASTE EACH OTHER'S BREATH I TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE CHEMICAL SENSING EPISODE NOW SOME MONTHS BACK BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE RECEPTORS FOR TASTE IN SMELL THAT ENGAGEING CORDINATED ACTION SUCH THAT WE CAN'T REALLY SEPARATE TASTE IN SMELL AT SOME LEVEL AND THIS IS A SPECIALLY TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE FORMATION OF ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND WHAT WE CALL CHEMISTRY NOW IS CHEMISTRY ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED FOR FORMING STABLE ATTACHMENTS FOR LOVE AND FOR DESIRE NO OF COURSE THERE NOT BUT IN GENERAL THESE ARE PRIMITIVE MECHANISMS THAT EXIST IN ALL ANIMALS THEY EXIST IN SPECIAL FORMS IN HUMANS BUT THAT THEY DRIVE US TRD BEHAVIORS THAT WILL AS THE THEORY GOES LEAD TO LOVE AND ATTACHMENT NOT ALWAYS AS DOCTOR FISHER POINTED OUT THAT SEC AND SECTS DRIVE IS ONE WAY TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL LOVE RELATIONSHIPS AND TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL ATTACHMENTS WHICH OF COURSE OUR MAJOR INVESTMENTS THAT EXTEND WELL BEYOND YON ONE NIGHT OR A WEAK OR A VACATION OR EVEN A YEAR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STABLE ATTACHMENTS IN GENERAL THAT MEANS LONG TERM ATTACHMENTS IN HUMANTS NOW THERE IS A BIOLOGY TO ALL OF THAT CHEMISTRY STUFF AND THE STUDIES OF ORAL CONTROCEPTION AND MEN FINDING WOMEN MORE ATTRACTIVE AT CERTAIN PHASES OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND WOMEN FINDING MEN MORE ATTRACTIVE AT CERTAIN PHASES OF THE WOMAN'S MENSTRUAL CYCLE POINT TO THE INCREDIBLE POWER OF THOSE DEEPER BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS IN THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST I DISCUSS BOTH SCIENCE AND SCIENCE BASE TOOLS AND SO I BE REMISHS IF I DIDN'T ACTUALLY COVER SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT RELATE TO THOSE DEEPER BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS HO THE HORMON'S TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST BIOLOGICAL CHEMICALS AND HORMONS THAT ARE MENTIONED AN DESCRIBED AND EXPLORED WHEND THINKING ABOUT DESIRE AND LOVE AN ATTACHMENT TOO FOR THAT MATTER SINCE LOVE AN ATTACHMENT STEM FROM DESIRE I DID AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND WAYS TO OPTIMIZE TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN YOU CAN EASILY FIND THAT EPISODE AT HUBERMAN LABDOT CAM ITS TIME STAMPED THERE YOU CAN FIND ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW SCERTAIN BEHAVIORS OR ABSENCE OF BEHAVIORS DRIVE UP OR DOWN TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN I ALSO DISPEL SOME MYTHS ABOUT A SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND THINGS LIKE MASTUROBATION AND HOW THEY RELATE TO TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AS WELL AS SOME MYTHS ABOUT HOW THOSE HORMONS CHANGE ACROSTHE LIFE'SPAN ALSEO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF EXERCISE I TO ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION AND I ALSO TALK A LITTLE BUT ABOUT HORMON REPLACEMENT THERAPIALE THATHE WILL BE THE TOPIC FOR A FUTURE EPISODE SO FYE ARE INTERESTED IN THE BIOLOGY OF TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN TOO HORMONS THAT ABSOLUTELY INFLUENCE THINGS LIKE LEBIDO AND DESIRE PLEASE CHECK OUT THAT EPISODE AS WELL AS WHAT I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN JUST A MOMENT HERE THE SIMPLE STEREOTYPED VERSION OF THE HORMONES TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN ARE THAT TESTOSTRON DRIVES LEBIDO OR INCREASES IT A C SEXTRIVE AND THAT ESTROGEN SOMEHOW BLUNCID OR IS NOT INVOLVED IN LEBIDO AND SEXTRIE AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE AS I DESCRIBE IN THAT TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGEN OPTIMISATION EPISODE AND AS I'LL TELL YOU NOW YES TESTOSTERON AND SOME OF ITS OTHER FORMS LIKE TO HYDRO TESTOSTRON ARE STRONGLY RELATED TO LEBIDO AND SEXTRIVE IN THE PURSUIT AND ABILITY TO MATE HOWEVER THE HORMON ESTROGEN IS ALSO STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH LEBIDO IN MADING BEHAVIOR SO MUCH SO THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT EITHER CHEMICALLY OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON HAVE VERY LOW ESTROGEN LEBIDO CAN SEVERELY SUFPER SO IT'S A CORDINATED DANCE OF ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES THAT LEADS TO LEBIDO OR SEXTRIVESO I ABSOLUWON TO MAKE CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT A A SIMPLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TESTOSTRON AND SEXTRIVE OR ESTROGENI SEXTORI BOTH ARE QUIRED AT APPROPRIATE RATIOS NOW WITH THAT SAID THERE ORE THINGS THAT CAN SHIFT LEBIDO IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IN THE DIRECTION OF MORE DESIRE OR MORE DESIRE TO MATE EITHER TO SEEK MATES OR TO MATE WITH EXISTING PARTNERS AND THERE IS A QUITE SOLID LITERATURE AROUND A FEW OF THOSE SUBSTANCES NOW A COMMON MISCONCEPTION IS THAT BECAUSE DOPOMINE IS INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION AND DRIVE THAT SIMPLY INCREASING DOPOMINE THROUGH ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OR TOOLS WILL INCREASE LEBIDO AND SEX DRIVE AND THAT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE EITHER IT IS TRUE THAT SOME LEVEL OF DOPOMINE OR INCREASE IN DOPAMINE IS REQUIRED FOR INCREASES IN LEBIDO HOWEVER BECAUSE OF DOPOMINE'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BECAUSE THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS SO INTIMATELY INVOLVED NOPUNINTENDED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY IN SEEKING AND ACTUAL MEADING BEHAVIOR AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER IT'S ACTUALLY THE CASE THAT IF PEOPLE DRIVE THEIR DOPAMINE SYSTEM TOO HIGH THEY WILL BE IN STATES OF AROUSAL THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH SUCH THAT THEY SEEK AND WANT SEXUAL ACTIVITY BUT THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY ENGAGE THE PARISYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC ERVOUS SYSTEM SUFFICIENT TO BECOME PHYSICALLY AROUSED OW THERE'S A WHOLE DESCRIPTION OF THIS UM THAT AWAITS US IN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT I'LL SUMMARIZE NOW BY SAYING FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING SUBSTANCES JUST SIMPLY TO INCREASE DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO INCREASE LEBIDO THAT CAN BE A POTENTIALLY HAS AR DESROUT TO FOLLOW BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHETHER R NOT THAT DOPAMINE LEVEL IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT IT PUTS THEM INTO A MOTIVE OF SEEKING MATES OR MATING BUT THEY CAN'T ADJUST THEIR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DURING ACTUAL MATING BEHAVIOR WHAT ESSENTUALISM SAYING AS IT CAN PLACE PEOPLE INTO A CHRONIC PURSUIT BUT AN INABILITY TO PERFORM SEXUALLY AND THIS IS TRUE FOR MEN AND WOMEN MOCA SO I WOULD JUST CAUTION PEOPLE AGAINST JUST THINKING OH A LACK OF LEBIDO IS SIMPLY A LACK OF DOPAMINE THAT IS NOT THE CASE IT COULD BE FROM LOWER LEVELS OF DOPOMINE BUT IT COULD ALSO BE FOR OTHER REASONS AND SO THESE SYSTEMS THESE SIGNALLING SYSTEMS THAN THESE NEUROCHEMICALS ARE VERY INTRICATE AND JUST SIMPLY RAMPING UP DOPAOMINE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN FOUND FOR INSTANCE IN A ANFETEMINE AND COCANE USERS THERE IS A PHENOMENON WHICH THEY BECOME HYPER AROUSE BUT CANT PERFORM SEXUALLY THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE ELEVATED LEVELS OF OTHER RECREATIONAL DRUGS OR WHO TAKE ANTI DEPRESSENCE THAT INCREASE THE DOPAOMINE SYSTEM TOO MUCH RIGHT DOSAGE HAS TO BE WORKED OUT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN WITH YOUR PSYCHIOTRIST SUCH THAT YOU KNOW MOOD IS I NHANCE AND O THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF A HEALTHY WELL BEING A MIND EMBODY ARE ENHANCED BUT NOT SO MUCH SO THAT THAT WHATL WE CALL THE AROUSAL ARK IS LACKED WITH THE SEE SAW IN THE SYMPATHETIC DRIVE POSITION SUCH THAT SEXUAL ROUSAL CAN'T OCCUR OKE SO THIS IS A AN IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE BECAUSE I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE OR UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IF THEY JUST DRIVE UP TESTASTERON INCREASE DOPAMIN AND GENERALLY GET THEMSELVES INTO HIGH STATES OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL THAT THAT SCAN INCREASE THE LIBIDO THAT SIMPLY NOT THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS IT'S THAT SE SAW AND THAT SE SAWING BACK AND FORTH THAT IS THE ARK OF AROUSAL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER NOW THERE ARE SUBSTANCES LEGAL OVER THE COUNTER SUBSTANCES THAT FALL UNDER THE CATEGRIZATION OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT DO INDEED INCREASE LIBIDO AND AROUSAL AND SOME MIN A TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE IN THE CONTECTS OF PURE REVIEWED LITERATURE NOW I WANTO BE CLEAR HOWEVER THAT THESE ARE BY NO MEANS REQUIRED A MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEALTHY LIBIDOS ARE HAVE LIBIDOS THAT ARE HALTHY FOR A THEIR LIFAND AND WHAT THEY NEED AND AND WANT A AND AS ALWAYS IN ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO CHECK WITH YOUR PHYSITION I DON'T YOU SAY THAT TO PROTECT US I SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU YOUR HEALTH AND WELL BEING AS DEPENDENT ON YOU DOING CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT DOING OTHERS AND EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT NONE THE LESS THERE ARE STUDIES THAT POINT TO SPECIFIC SUBSTANCES THAT ARE SOLD OVER THE COUNTER THAT AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES ARE LEGAL AND THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN INCREASING MEASURES OF LIBIDO THERE ARE MANY SUCH SUBSTANCES BUT THREE THAT IN PARTICULAR HAVE GOOD PURE REVIEWED RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THEM ARE MACA M A C A WHICH IS ACTUALLY A ROOT TONGAT ALI ALSO SOMETIMES CALLED LONGJAC I DIDN'T NAME THEM FORGIVE ME AND TRIBULUS AR TRIBULUS IT SOMETIMES CALLED AMANENT TALK ABOUT EACH OF THESE INSEQUENTS BUT ON THE WHOLE THE STUDIES ON MACA ARE QUITE CONVINCING THAT CONSUMPTION OF TWO TO THREE GRAHAMS PER DAY OF MACA WHICH GENERALLY IS SOLD AS A POWDER OR A CAPSIL TYPICALLY CONSUMED EARLY IN THE DAY BECAUSE IT CAN BE SOMEWHAT OF A STIMULANT MEANING IT CAN INCREASE A LERTNESS AND YOU WOULDN'T WANTED TO INTERFERE A WITH SLEEP BY TAKING IT TOO LATE IN THE DAY BUT IN STUDIES THAT INCLUDE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN OF DURATIONS ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE WEEKS OF ATHLETES AND NONATHLETES AND DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF MACA TURNS OUT THEIRS BLACK MACA RED MACA YELLOW MACA THEIR BUNCH OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF MACA BUT THAT THEY CAN INCREASE SUBJECTIVE REPORTS OF SEXUAL DESIRE INDEPENDENT OF HORMON SYSTEMS MEANING IT DOES NOT SEEM AT LEAST BASED ON THE EXISTING LITERATURE THAT MACCA INCREASES TO STASTERONE OR CHANGES ESTROGEN AT LEAST NOT ON THE TIME SCALES AF THESE STUDIES WERE DONE OR WITH THE MEASURES THAT WERE A PERFORMED IN THESE STUDIES BUT THAT MACA AGAIN CONSUMED IT FRIN DOSES OF ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO THREE GRAMS PER DAY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE LIBIDO AND IN FACT THOSE DOSAGES OF MACA HAVE BEEN SHOWNE TO OFFSET SO CALLED ESSESSES ORI INDUCED SEXUAL DISFUNCTION SO THEIR VARIOUS ROUTS TO SEXUAL DISFUNCTION THE ESESSARIZE ARE SELECTIVE CERETONEAN REUP TAKE IN HIBITERS A THEY GO BY NAMEBRAMS LIKE PROZAC AND SOLOFT AND THEIR MANY OTHERS NOW A GENERIC FORMS AND SO FORTH THOSE DON'T ALWAYS I SHOULD POINT OUT LEAD TO SEXUAL DISFUNCTION THERE IS A DOSE DEPENDENTS A SOME PEOPLE DO QUITE WELL ON ESESSORIZE AND DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH SEXUAL FUNCTION OTHER PEOPLE SUFFER QUITE A LOT AM FROM SEXUAL DISFUNCTION WILE TAKING ESSESSORISES HIGHLY VARIABLE YOU NEED TO WORK WITH A PHYSICIAN A A QUALIFIED SYCHATRIS BUT NONE THE LESS EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN SAYING ABOUT MACA THUS FAR HAS ALSO BEEN EXPLORED IN THE CONTECTS OF ESESSOR INDUE SEXUAL DISFUNCTION THE PAPER AM THAT I IFERRING TO HEAR IS A A DOUBLE BLIND RHANDOMIZE PILOT DOSE FINDING STUDY OF MACA ROUT IT GOES BY THE NAME EL MAENI A THESE ALWAYS HAVE FANCY NAMES IN THE LATIN AMES AN MIALGY ARE ALWAYS MORE COMPLY BUT ITS MACA ROUT FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ESESSORI INDU SEXUAL DISFUNCTION A FIRST AUTHOR IS DORDING DIOR DI IENCI AM THIS WAS A STUDY DONE AT MASGENERAL A WHICH IS A ONE OF THE SATELLITE A LOCATIONS ROUND HARVARD HARVARD MED ASSOCIATE WITH HARVARD MED AM THAT FOUND A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS A IN LEBIDO WHEN PEOPLE WERE TAKING A PRETTY LOW DOSE WO WAS ASSUA IN THIS CASE JUST ONE POINT FIVE GRAMS PER DAY AM UP TO A HIDOSE THREE GRAMS PER DAY OF MACA A AND THEY WERE DOING THIS IN A TWENTY REMITTED DEPRESSED OUTPATIENTS OF THESE RE PEOPLETHAT HAD DEPRESSION THEIR DEPRESSION WAS SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH ESA SORIES BUT THEY WERE SUFFERING FROM SOME OF THESE ESESSOR I RELATED A SEXUAL EFFECTS AND MACA SEEM TO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE EFFECTS OM SIGNIFICANTLY  IN THIS POPULATION THE OTHER STUDIES EXPLORING THE LACK OF EFFECT ON CERM TESTASTERON IN WHAT IN ADULT HEALTHY MEN A WAS A TWELVE WEEK STUDY AGAIN A CONSUMING ANYWHERE FROM ONE POINT FIVE TO THREE MIL A MILIGRAMS MEANING ONE A SCUSE ME FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO THREE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OR PLUCIBO SO AGAIN THIS IS ONE POINT FIVE UP TO THREE GRAHMS OF MACA OR PLUCIBO AM AND THEY RATED AM SEXUAL DESIRE A DEPRESSION AND AN OTHER MEASURE SISTERS TESTASTERONE AND IN THE BLOOD AGAIN NO CHANGE IN TESTASTERON OR ESTROGEN AM ESTRODILE LEVELS IN MEN TREATED WITH MACA AND THOSE TREET WITH PLUCIBO BUT NONE THE LESS AM THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE EFFECT ON LEBIDO WITH THIS DOSAGE OF ONE POINT FIVE TO THREE GRAMS PER DAY MACA AND THEIR SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES A THAT ALSO SHOW THIS AGAIN A IN PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING US OR ESELRIZE AND PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT TAKING ASCESSORISE IN IN CHRONICALLY A OVER TRAINED ATHLETES A THIS WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE THE CASO SEEMS LIKE A ACROSS THE BOARD A MACAS A FAIRLY USEFUL A SUPPLEMENT FOR THOSE THAT ARE A SEEKING TO INCREASE THE LIBIDO AND THERE ARE FEWER STUDIES INVOLVING WOMEN BUT THERE ARE A FEW SUCH STUDIES THAT ALSO POINT TO THE SAME GENERAL PASIVE EFFECT ON LIBIDO IN WOMEN TAKING MACA AT EQUIVALENT DOSIS TO THOSE I JUST DESCRIBED I THINK IT'S NOTEWORTHY THAT MACA SUPPLEMENTATION DOES NOT SEEM TO ADJUST TESTASTRON OR ESTURGEN LEVELS TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE BUT IT DOES CHANGE LIBIDO I THINK THAT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT INFLUENCE LIBIDO NOT JUST TESTASTRONE AN ESTROGEN INDEED WE KNOW THAT TO BE THE CASE THINGS LIKE P E A WHICH IS A SUBSTANCE FOUND IN CHOCOLATE AND IS A SUBSTANCE THAT SOME PEOPLE SUPPLEMENT IS KNOWN FOR INCTANCE TO INCREASE SEXUAL DESIRE BUT ALSO THE PERCEPTION OF SEXUAL EXPERIENCES AS A MORE STIMULATING FOR INSTANCE SO THERE A LOT OF PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR IN THE HYPOF FALAMUS A THIS ANCIENT ERY OF OUR BRAIN THAT HARBORS NURONS AND FORMON SECRETING CELLS INCLUDING NURONS THAT CAN SHAPE OUR PERCEPTIONS OF ARE EVEN JUST OUR TACTILE EXPERIENCE OF A OTHERS AN THEIR ATTRACTIVENESS AN INDEED CAN SHIFT LEVELS OF DESIRE INDEPENDENT OF CHANGING LEVELS OF CIRCULATING HORMONS ANOTHER SUBSTANCE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE LIBIDO ACROSS A RANGE OF HUMAN POPULATIONS IS SO CALLED TONGAT ALI I'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BEFORE ON THE HUBURMAN LABPOD CAST IN REFERENCE TO TESTASTERON AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT EXTENSIVELY IS A GUEST ON OTHER POD CASS TONGA ALI GOES BY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NAMES A ONE OFTHEM IS EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO PRONOUNCE ITS A MURI KOMA LONGIFOLIA A ALSO CA LONGJAC A BUT TONGAAL IS THE TYPICAL NAME ATHIS IS AN HERB THEREIS A MALASIAN VERSION AND AN IDINESIAN VERSION A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE IDINESIAN VARIETY OF TONGAALI IS THE ONE THAT IS MOST POTENT FOR A ITS EFFECTS ON LIBIDO PREVIOUSLY I'VE TALKED ABOUT TONGAALI TAKEN IN FOUR HUNDRED MELEGRAM PER DAY CAPSULS AS A MEANS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FREE MEANING UNBOUND TESTASTRON SO TESTASTRON HAS A BOTH BOUND FORM AND AN UNBOUND FORM VERY BRIEFLY THE BOUND FORM IS BOUND TO ALBUMEN IN THE BLOOD OR TO SO CALLED SEX FORMON BINDING GLOBULAN A WHEN IT'S BOUND IT CAN'T BE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE AT MANY CELLS A IT IS IMPORTAN THAT SOME OF IT BE BOUND IN ORDER TO GET A SORT OF TIME RELEASE AND AND PROPER DISTRIBUTION OF TESTASTRON THROUG THE BODY BUT IS THE UNBOUND FREE TESTA STERONE THAT CAN REALLY HAVE ITS MOST POTENT DEFFECTS AND THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT TONGAALI CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF UNBOUND SO CALLED FREE TESTASTERONE BY LOWERING SEX HORMON BINDING GLOBULENT ALTHOUGH IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT IT HAS OTHER ROUTES OF MECHANISM AS WELL NONE THE LESS THERE ARE SOME REPORTS OF TONGAALI INCREASING LEBIDO A ONE PARTICULAR ARTICLE A LAST AUTHOR A OR I SHOULD SAY LAST NAME OF FIRST AUTHOR ESCUSE ME ISMALE I S AMAEL THIS WAS M PUBLISHED IN A IN EVIDENT SPACE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERN OF MEDICINE S FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REPORTS A A SIGNIFICANT A INCREASE IN LEBIDO AND SEXUAL FUNCTION THERE ARE OTHER SUCH STUDIES NOT A LOT OF THEM NOT AS MANY ROBUST CONTROLLED QUALITY PURE UED STUDIES AS THERE ARE FROM MACA NONE THE LESS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE MEN AND WOMEN UM THAT I KNOW DO TAKE A TONGAALAND IT SEEMS TO TO WORK WELL FOR THEM THE QUESTION ALWAYS COMES UP AROUND DISCUSSION OF SUPPLEMENTS DO YOU NEED TO CYCLE THESE THINGS THE ONLY WAY TO DETERMINE THAT IS REALLY TO DO YOUR BLOOD WORK MONITOR LIVER AND ZIMES A MONOR HORMON LEVELS AND SO FORTH SO I I SIMPLY CAN'T SAY WHETHER NOT YOU AM N TO WHERE YOU DON'T NEED TO CYCLE THEM TIPICALLY A TONGAALI AND MACA ARE NOT CYCLED IN ANY REGULAR CONNOWAY THAT I AM AWARE OF BUT AM AGAIN YOU REALLY NEED TO CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR IF YOUARE GOING TO INITIATE TAKING ANY OF THESE THINGS AM AND YOU CERTAINLY SHOULD DO YOUR BEST TO MONITOR YOUR BLOOD WORK AS WELL AS SUBJECTIVE MEASURES IN EVALUATING WHETHER NOT THEIR WORKING FOR YOU SAY FOR YOU AND SO FORTH THE THIRD AND FINAL SUBSTANCE SLASH SUPPLEMENT THAT I WANT A TOUCH ON AS IT RELATES TO LEBIDO IS CALLED TRIBULUS TERESTUS SO THAT T R I BU LU S TERRESTUS T E R R E S T R I S THIS IS A COMMONLY SOLD OVER THE COUNTER SUPPLEMENT FOR INCREASING TESTASTERON FOR YO FITNESS PURPOSES AND AND SO ON WHETHER NOT IT ACTUALLY DOES THAT TO A A MEANINGFUL DEGREE A IS IN CLEAR BUT I'M AWARE OF FOOR PURE REVIEWED STUDIES THAT WERE FOCUSED ON BOTH MALES AND FEMALES OM RANGING ANYWHERE FROM A EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD ALL THE WY UP TO SIXTY FIVE PLUS THEY SAY SIXTY FIVE PLUS I GUESS THAT COULD BE SEVENTY COULD BE EIGHTY I DON'T KNOW BUT A FAIRLY BROAD AGE RANGE A WHERE PEOPLE TOOK ANYWHERE FROM A SEVEN HUNDRED AN FIFTY MILIGRAMS PER DAY DIVIDED INTO THREE EQUAL DOSES SO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TOTAL PER DAY DIVIDIN TO THREE EQUALDOSES OF TRIBULUS A OR PLACIBO FOR HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS OM THIS PARTCULAR STUDY WAS FOCUSED ON FEMALES AM AND ACCORDING TO THE FEMALE SEXUAL FUNCTION INDIX QUESTION EIR AM NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY OF THE GROUPS HOWEVER FREE AN BIO AVAILABLE TESTOSTRONE INCREASED IN THE GROUP TAK ING TRIBULOUS TERRESTUS TOTAL TESTOSTERON DID NOT REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE SO THIS A SORT OF THE INVERSE OF WHAT WE SEE WITH MACA WHERE THEIR DU SEEM TO BE INCREASEES IN TESTSTERON WHICH WOULD PREDICT THAT THRE WOULD BE INCREASE IN LIBIDO IN THIS CASE IN THIS WAS POSTMEN APOZLO WOMEN THERE WAS NO INCREASE IN LIBIDO THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN TESTASTERON I MENTION IT ONLY BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE INSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE WANT TO INCREASE THEIR TESTOSTERON IT DOES SEEM THAT TRIBULOUS AT LEAST IN THAT POPULATION IS CAPABLE OF DOING THAT NOW THERE'S A SEPARATE STUDY THAT WAS DONE A DOUBLE BLIND STUDY A LASTING ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO SIX MONTHS THAT HAD A CLEAR AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LIBIDO NOW THIS WAS TAKING SIX GRAHAMS SO THAT SIX SIX THOUSAND MELIGRAMS OF TRIBULOUS ROOT FOR SIXTY DAYS AND IT DID SEEM TO INCREASE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SEXUAL FUNCTION AND THERE WAS A WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL SIXTEEN POINT THREE PER CENT INCREASE IN TESTASTERON BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY BECAUSE OF THE VERY ABILITY ACROSS INDIVIDUALS THAT DID NOT ACTUALLY ARRIVE AT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE NOW THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OTHER STUDIES THAT EXPLORED THE ROLL OF TRIBULOUS IN PARTICULAR IN IN FEMALES AND ONE OF THOSE STUDIES WAS A STUDY THAT WAS USHALLY QUITE SHORT IT WAS TWO TO FOUR WEEKS I INVOLVE SIXTY SEVEN SUBJECTS ON THESE WERE SUBJECTS THAT HAD EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF LIBIDO AND TOOK TRIBULOUS DIVIDE INTO TWO EQUALDOSES COMPARE THAT TO PLOCIBO AND THEY DID SEE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THESE MEASURES OF SEXUAL DESIRE AND FUNCTION ON THIS FEMALE SEXUAL FUNCTION IN DEXTS SO THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT TRIBULUS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING TESTOSTERON IN CERTAIN POPULATIONS IND INCREASING SEXUAL DESIRE AND FUNCTION IN CERTAIN POPULATIONS PARTICULAR IN FEMALES I THINK MORE STUDIES ARE CERTAINLY NEEDED BUT THESE THREE SUBSTANCES A SLASH SUPPLEMENTS MACA TONGA ALI IN PARTICULAR INDONICIANTONGAALI AND TRIBULOUS CAN INDEED CREATE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SEXUAL DESIRE AND IN SOME CASES BY A JUSTING THE TESTASTERON AN ESTRIGEN SISTEM IN SOME CASES NOT BY ADJUSTING THE TESTASTERON ESTRIGEN SYSTEM AGAIN POINTING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF NERCHEMICALS INFREATURES THAT ADJUST THINGS LIKE LIBIDO ECA DESIRE SO WE COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL TO DAY RELATED TO DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT AND YET I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE OF THE VAST LANDSCAPE THAT IS THE PSYCHOLOGY IN BIOLOGY OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT NONE THE LESS I HOPE THAT YOU FOUND THE INFORMATION INTERESTING AND HOPEFULLY ACTIONABLE IN SOME CASES TOWARD THE RELATIONSHIPS OF YOUR

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPOCAS  SCIENCE SCIENCE TACE TO FOR  AI'M ANDREW HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME ID LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR RAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK OM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER HEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN INVITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'L GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPL PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELLA MEN TE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT HORMONES AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON HOW PARTICULAR HORMONES INFLUENCE ARE ENERGY LEVELS AND ARE IMMUNE SYSTEM NOW LAST EPISODE I MENTION AT THE END THAT WE WERE CONCLUDING OUR MONTH ON HORMONES BUT WE DECIDE TO INCLUDE THIS ADDITIONAL EPISODES THIS WOULD BE THE FIFTH EPISODE IN THE SEQUENCE OF EPISODES ABOUT HORMONES BECAUSE THEREARE TWO HORMONES WHICH ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR A HUGE NUMBER OF BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS THAT WEWILL TALK ABOUT TO DAY BUT THAT ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR ENERGY LEVELS AND YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I GET ASKED ABOUT A LOT SO RATHER THAN SKIP TO THE NEXT GENERAL TOPIC TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE HORMONS CORTESAL AND EPINEFERAN ALSO CALLED ADRENOIN YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE HEARD THE PREVIOUS EPISODES ON HORMONES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND AN DIGEST THE MATERIAL FROM TO DAY'S PODCAST IF I MENTION ANYTHING RELATED TO PREVIOUS EPISODES I PROMISE TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF QUICK BACKGROUND TO GET EVERYONE UP TO SPEED TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF CORTESAL WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF EPINEFRAN AS ALWAYS WILL TALK MECHANISM AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF TOOLS I YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO STRUGGLES WITH STRESS AND ENERGY LEVELS AND BALANCING STRESS AND ENERGY LEVELS TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO BE VITAL FOR YOU IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO HAS CHALLENGES WITH SLEEP OR YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO HAS CHALLENGES GETTING YOUR ENERGY LEVEL UP THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND GETTING YOUR ENERGY LEVEL DOWN WHEN YOU WANT TO SLEEP TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO FOR YOU AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HOW TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM WE'RE LSO E GOING TO GET INTO SOMEFUN TOPICS RELATING TO LEARNING AND MEMORY AND HOW YOU CAN LEVERAGE CORTESAL AND EPINEFERAN IN PARTICULAR IN ORDER TO LEARN FASTER WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SO CALLED NEUTROPICS SMART DRUGS AND HOW THEY WORK BECAUE THEIRE SEVERAL OF THEM THAT TAP IN TO THE EPINEFERAN SYSTEM THAT AREN'T OFTIN DISCUST AND THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT HOW CAFFIN CAN ACTUALLY REWIRE YOUR BRAIN FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF COMFORT FOODS AND WHY THEY WORK SO WELL AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND IN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR FOOD CHOICES AS THEY RELATE TO SHORT TERMIN LONG TERM ENERGY SO WE HVE A LOT TO COVER EVERYTHNG WILL BE TIME STAMPED I WANTED JUST REMIND PEOPLE THAT WE CAPTION EVERY EPISODE IN ENGLISH END IN SPANISH THE CAPTIONS TAKE A DAY OR TWO TO POP UP ON YOU TOBE SO I YOU'RE NOT SEEING THOSE WITHIN THE FIRST COUPLE DAYS PLEASE BE PATIENT WITH US IN ORDER TO GET CAPTIONS THAT ACTUALLY READ A SIMILARLY TO WHAT I'M SAYING IF WE GO THRYOUR CAPTIONING SERVICE AND SO WE HAVE THEM DONE BY EXPERTS IN THAT TAKES HA LITTLE IF ADDITIONAL TIME MEANWHILE IF YOUE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS THE EPISODE EVOLVES PLEASE WRITE THEM DOWN PLEASE PUT THEM IN THE COMMENT SECTION PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY AND LET'S GET STARTED TALKING ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE YOUR ENERGY AND IMPROVE AND INCREASE YOUR IMMUNITY BI LEVERGYNG THE BIOLOGY OF CORTESAL AND ADRENOLINE BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THE BIOLOGY OF INCREASING ENERGY AND YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM WON A COVER THREE TOPICS THAT I PROMISED I WOULD MENTION FROM PREVIOUS EPISODES THE FIRST ONE RELATES TO INTERMITTENT FASTING THE SECOND ONE RELATES TO WYR STOMACH GRUMBLES FORGOT TO MENTION THE BIOLOGY OF THAT LAST TIME THE THIRD IS A POWERFUL WAY TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON WHICH IS POWERFUL FOR INCREASING METABOLISM FATBURNING AND TISSUE REPAIR ET CETERA THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE A SANA OR RAPPING YOURSELF IN PLASTIC BAGS AND GOING FOR FOR A JOG SO FIRST INTERMITTANT FASTING LAST EPISODE I TALKED A LOT ABOUT GROWTH HORMON AND FHIEROID HARMON AND I MENTION THINGS LIKE SANA AND EXERCISE AND SLEEP AND HOW THEY CAN INCREASE LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMON WITHIN THE HEALTHY RANGES AND WHY INCREASING GROWTH HARMON CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL BECAUSE IT CAN BURN OFF BODY FAT IT CAN IMPROVE MUSCLE AND GENERAL TISSUE HEALTH CARTILAGE ET CETERA AND WE TEND TO LOSE OR OUR LEVELS OF GROWTH HOARMON ARE REDUCED AS WE AGE MANY PEOPLE AST ME WILL WHAT ABOUT FASTING EVERYONE'S BEEN PROMIST ON THE INTERNET THAT INTERMITT IN FASTING LEADS TO THESE BIG INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON THE REASON I DIDN'T MENTION IT IS THAT I COULDN'T FIND A STUDY THAT ACTUALLY POINTED TO THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM I SAW LOTS OF CLAIMS LOTS OF PODCASTS LOTS OF A DEGREES BEHIND PEOPLE'S NAMES SOMETIMES BIOLOGIST SOMETIMES ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FIELDS TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT VERY FEW STUDIES AND THEN I FOUND WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER THESE STUDY WE WILL LINK TO THI STUDY TURNS OUT THAT FASTING DOES INCREASE GROWTH HORMON LEVELS AND THE WAY THAT IT DOES IT IS FASTINATING I MENTION IN A PREVIOUS PODCAST ABOUT HUNGER AND TIMING OF MULES AND TIMING OF HUNGER THAT WHEN YOUR HUNGRY YOU RELEASE A HORMON IN YOUR BODY CALLED GRELLEN SOMETIMES ACTUALLY CALLED GREELAND THANKSFOR ALL F YIOU GREELANIS DES OR GRELLANISDOES THAT CORRECTED MY PRONUNCIATION IT'S BOTH GRELLEN OR GREELAN EITHER ONE WORKS GRELLEN MAKES YOU HUNGRY WHEN BLOOD GLUE COAST YOUR BLOOD SUGER IS LOW GRELLEN IS SECRETED AND MAKES YOU HUNGRY AND IT TURNS OUT THAT GRELLEN THIS HUNGER HORMON ACTUALLY BINDS TO THE RECEPTER IN THE BRAIN THAT NORMALLY BINDS WHAT'S CALLED GROWTH HORMON RELEASING HORMON SO BELIEVE ARE NOT THE HUNGER HORMON CAN ACT LIKE GROWTH HARMON RELEASING HARMON AND THEREBY STIMULATE GROWTH HORMON NOW THE LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMON THAT FASTING PROMOTES THROUGH THIS GRELLEN SYSTEM ARE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL IT'S ABOUT A DOUBLING OF GROWTH HORMON LEVELS IN THE WAKING STATE SO WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN RELEASE GROWTH HORMON AN SLEEP INTERMITTEN FASTING IT TURNS OUT CAN INCREASE GROWTH HARMON BY BINDING GRELLEN TO THE GROWTH HARMON RELEASING HORMON RECEPTER AND IT DOES IT ALSO DURING THE DAYTIME SO YES INDEED FASTING CAN INCREASE GROWTH HORMON NOT TO THE SUPRA LEVELS THAT TAKING GROWTH HARMON WOULD INCREASE IT OR THAT A SANA COULD INCREASE IT BUT IT DOES SEEM TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON LATER IN TO DAY'S EPISODE WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF FA STING AND EATING THAT CAN CONTROL AT BENEFEREN AND SO WE WILL RETURN TO SPECIFICS ABOUT HOW LONG A FAST YOU NEED TO FASTS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS OR TWENTY THREE HOURS FORTUNATELY FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO LOVE TO EAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO WE'LL TALK SPECIFIC FASTING PROTOCALS LATER IN THE EPISODE WE ALSO SAID WER CAN TALK ABOUT TOMMY GRUMBLE WHEN YOUR STOMACH GROWLS IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF FLUID SIFTING AROUND IN THEIR LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OH YOU KNOW IT'S FLUID SIFTING ROUND TURNS OUT THAT YOUR STOMACH HAS SMOOTH MUSCLE THAT LINES ITS SIDES AND WHEN YOU EAT SOMETHING OR YOU DON'T EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOUR STOMACH SINCHES OFF AT THE TWO ENDS LIKE A BAG WITH A HOSE ON EITHER END CAUS THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS AND IF THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MUSCLES THAT LINE THE SIDES OF YOUR STOMACH THEY KIND OF EXTEND AROUND THE STOMACH IN THESE CABLES THOSE ARE ALWAYS THERE AND IF YOU HAVE FOOD IN YOUR STOMACH WHAT THEY DO AS THEY CHURN YOUR STOMACH THEY LITERALLY TURN THE MUSCLES OF YOUR STOMACH LIKE A TUMBLER TO HELP BREAK UP THE FOOD THAT PRESUMABLY YOU DIDN'T CHOO WELL ENOUGH CAUS YOU ARE EATING TOO FAST WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD IN YOUR STOMACH THAT CHURNIN CONTINUES AND THAT CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLE AN THE TURNING LITERALLY TURNING OVER OF YOUR MUSCLES THEY DON'T FLIP OVER COMPLETELY BUT THE TURNING OVER THE MUSCLES THAT'S WHAT CAUSE IS THE STOMACH GROWLING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE PERSON IN THE MEATING OR SITTING THERE AT IN A QUIET THEADER WHOSE STOMACH IS GROWLING CHER YOUR FOOD BETTER THAT'S THE SIMPLE SOLUTION AND LAST EPISODE I TALK TA LOT ABOUT HOUSANA CONTROLLED SAFE HYPEROTHERMIA CAN CAUSE HUGE INCREASES IN GROWTH HOMEON RELEASE ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED EVEN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED PER CENT INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE REALLY STAGGERINGLY HIGH INCREASES  POINT OUT THAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE SAUNAS IN THEIR YARD OR IN THEIR HOMES AND THEY WOULD GO THROUGH SOME OTHER MEASURES TO INCREASE SAFELY THEIR BODY HEAT AH YOUN'T CREATING A STEAM ROUM IN THEIR BATH ROOM OR JOGGING WITH EXTRA SWEATS ON THIS KIND OF THING MANY OF YOU ASKED ABOUT HOT BATHS HOT BATHS WILL INCREASE GROWTHS GROWTH HORMONES CUSE ME HOWEVER THE TEMPERATURES THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON ARE HIGH ENOUGH THAT YOU RUN THE RISK OF BURN AND SO REALLY CAN'T MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOT BATHS BUT IF YOU CAN TOLERATE A NICE HOT BATH YOU ARE GOING TO GET SOME GROWTH HOMEONE RELEASE HOWEVER THE SANA HAS THITS ADVANTAGE OF YOU BEING ABLE TO ENTER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DEGREE OR TWO HUNDRED DEGREE ENVIRONMENT PROVIDEDG YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT YOUR NOT A YOUNG CHILD ET CETERA YOU CAN DO THAT SAFELY AND GETTING BIG INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON THE HOT BATH WILL LEAD TO LESSER INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON WE'E GONGTO TALK A LOT ABOUT TEMPERATURE REGULATION IN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT AS ALWAYS IF YOU ARE EVER GOING TO START PLAYING WITH HYPEROTHERMIA OR HYPOTHERMIA COLD BATHS ICE BATHS HOT SHOWERS HOT BATHS THAT ARE BEYOND THE KIND OF NORM OF WHAT'S COMFORTABLE YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL NE PLEASE CONSULT THE DOCTOR I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY DURING THE DAY IF YOU WORK DURING THE DAY AND THEY LIKE THEIR ENERGY TO TAPEROFF AT NIGHT AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T ENJOY BEING SICK NOBODY WANTS TO GET SICK IN OTHER WORDS YOU WONT TO HAVE ENERGY AND YOU WANT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO FUNCTION WELL TO WARD OFF INFECTIONS OF VARIOUS KINDS BACTERIAL INFECTIONS VIRAL INFECTIONS ET CETERA IT TURNS OUT THAT THE TWO HORMONES THAT DOMINATE THOSE PROCESSES OF HAVING ENOUGH ENERGY AND HAVING A HEALTHY IMUN SYSTEM OR CORTISALL AND EPINEPRON EPINEPFRON IS THE SAME THING AS A DRENOINE IN THE BODY WE TEND TO CALL A DRENOLIN ADRENOLIN AND IN THE BRAIN WE TEND TO CALL A DRENOLIN EPINEPRON AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT I DIDN'T CREATE THIS NAMING SYSTEM AND THE STORY BEHIND IT IS UNINTERESTING AND NOT WORTH OUR TIME I WILL USE THE WORDS A DRENOLINE AND EPINEPRON INTERCHANGEABLY TODAY CORTISLL IS CORTISALL AND I JUST ONE TO COVER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CORTIAL AN EPINEFRON ARE WHERE THEY ARE RELEASED IN THE BODY AND BRAIN BECAUSE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW TO CONTROL THEM FIRST OF ALL CORTISALL IS A STEROID HORMONE MUCH LIKE ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON IN THAT IT IS DERIVED FROM COLLESTRAL NOW THAT COULD BE COLLESTRAL THAT YOU EAT IT COULD BE COLLESTRAL THAT'S PRODUCED BY THE LIVER AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIETARY COLLESTRAL THE FATS THAT YOU EAT AND BLOOD COLLESTRAL AND LIVER COLLESTRAL IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ONE IT'S A BARBED WIRE TOPIC THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CLAIM THAT DIETARY COLLESTRAL HAS ZERO IMPACT ON CIRCULATING COLLESTRAL COMING FROM THE LIVER THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARGUE THE EXACT OPPOSITE BOTH WITH GOOD DATA IN HAND I WOULD SAY THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE IDEA THAT ALL YOUR COLLESTRAL LEVELS ARE DETERMINED BY DIETARYANTAKE NAMELY THAT AN ERECICS OFTEN HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF COLLESTRAL THAT THEIR LIVER PRODUCES EVENTHOUGH THEY ARE EATING VERY LITTL AND SOMETIMES NOT EATING AT ALL SO UNDERSTAND THAT COLLESTRAL IS A PRECURSER MOLECULE MEANING IT'S THE SUBSTRATE FROM WHICH A LOT OF THINGS LIKE TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN ARE MADE PLEASE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT COLLESTRAL CAN BE MADE INTO ESTROGEN OR TESTOSTRON OR CORTESALL AND THAT CORTISALL IS SORT OF THE COMPETITIVE PARTNER TO ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON WHAT THIS MEANS IS NO MATTER HOW MUCH COLLESTRAL YOUR EATING OR YOU PRODUCE WHETHER NOTS LOW ER ITS HIGH IF YOU ARE STRESSED MORE OF THAT COLLESTRAL IS GOING TO BE DEVOTED TOWARD CREATING CORTISALL WHICH IS INDEED A STRESHORMON HOWEVER THE WORD STRESSED SHOULDN'T STRESS YOU OUT BECAUSE YOU NEED CORTISALL CORTISAL IS VITAL YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CORTISAL LEVELS TO BE TOO LOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR IMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION FOR MEMORY FOR NOT GETTING DEPRESSED YOU JUST DON'T WANT YOUR CORTIZAL LEVELS TO BE TOO HIGH AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO BE ELEVATED EVEN TO NORMAL LEVELS AT THE WRONG TIME OF DAY SO WE'RE TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO CONTROL THE TIMING AND LEVEL OF YOUR CORTISALL EPINEFRON OR A DRENOLINE HAS ALSO BEEN DEMONIZED A BIT WE THINK OF IT AS THE STRESS HORMONE THIS THING THAT MAKES US ANXIOUS FIGHT OR FLIGHT TA YOU KNOW WE IS TO GET CHASED BY LINES AND TIGERS AND BEARS AND NOW WE DON'T AND IT'S THI ANCIENT HANG OVER THAT'S ALL WRONG THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE EPINEFRAN IS YOUR BEST FRIEND WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR IMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING YOU FROM INFECTION AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHIGH AND EPINEFRAN ADRENOLIN IS YOUR BEST FRIEND WHEN IT COMES TO REMEMBERING THINGS AND LEARNING AND ACTIVATING NOURAL PLASTICITY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL ONCE AGAIN IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH AND HOW LONG AND THE SPECIFIC TIMING OF RELEASE OF CORTIZAL AN EPIN EFFERON AS OPPOSED TO CORTIS ALL AND A DRENALIN BEING GOOD OR BAD THEYRE TERRIFIC WHEN THEY'RE REGULATED THEY ARE TERRIBLE WHEN THEI'R MISS REGULATED AND WE ILL GIVE YOU LOTS OF TOOLS TO REGULATE THEM BETTER CORTIS ALL BIOLOGY ONE O ONE IN LESS THAN TWO MINUTES YOUR BRAIN MAKES WHAT WE CALL RELEASING HORMONES AND IN THIS CASE THERE'S CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING HORMONE C OR H IS MADE BY NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN IT CAUSES THE PETUITARY THIS GLAND THAT SITS ABOUT AN INCH IN FRONT OF THE ROOF FOR YOUR MOUTH IN THE BASEIOUR BRAIN TO RELEASE  C T H  C T H THEN GOES AND CAUSES YOUR ADRENOLS WHICH SIT ABOVE YOUR KIDNEYS IN YOUR LOWER BACK TO RELEASE CORTISAL A SO CALLED STRESS HORMONE BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT CORTIS ALL NOT AS A STRESS HORMONE BUT AS A HORMON OF ENERGY IT PRODUCES A SITUATION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY WHEREBY YOU WANT TO MOVE AND WHEREBY YOU DON'T WANT TO REST AND WHEREBY YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT AT LEAST AT FIRST EPINEFERON OR A DRENOLIN ONE O ON IN LESS THAN TWO MINUTES WHEN YOU SENSE A STRESSER WITH YOUR MIND OR YOUR BODY SENSEAS A STRESS STRESSER EXCUSE ME FROM A WOUND OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT A SIGNAL IS SENT TO NURONS THAT ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR BODY THEY CALL THE SYMPATHETIC CHAIN GANGLEA THE NAME DOESN'T NECESSARILY MATTER THEY RELEASE NOR EPINEFRAN VERY QUICKLY IT'S ALMOST LIKE A A SPRINKLER SYSTEM THAT JUST HOSES YOUR BODY WITH EPINEFRON ITHAT WILL INCREASE HEART RATE WILL INCREASE BREATHING RATE IN SOME CASES WILL CONSTRICT YOUR BLOOD VESSELS IT WILL ALSO INCREASE THE SIZE OF VESSELS AND ARTERIES THAT ARE GIVING BLOOD FLOW TO YOUR VITAL ORGANS THIS IS WHY YOUR EXTREMITIES GET COLD WHEN YOUR STRESSED AND YOUR HEART IS BEATING FASTER MORE THAT ENERGY IS BEING DEVOTED TOWARD ITOWARD YOUR CORPS YOU ALSO RE EASE A DRENALINE FROM YOUR ADRENALS IN AGAIND SIT RITING ATOP YOUR KIDNES THOSE ARE A SECOND SYSTEM WHEREBY YOUR SYSTEM GETS FLOODED WITH ADRENALINE IN PULSES SO YOU GET ONE PULSE YOU GET TEN PULSES WILL TALK ABOUT OW TO REGULATE THE NUMBER OF PULSES END YOU RELEASE IT FROM AN AIR OF YOUR BRAIN CALLED LOCUS SERULIUS AND THAT CREATES ALERTNESS IN YOUR BRAIN IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE STRESS RESPONSE AND ALL THE DETAILS OF THAT INCLUDING SOME PROTOCALS OF HOW TO REGULATE STRESS PLEASE SEE OUR EPISODE ABOUT STRESS I GO IN TO A LOT OF DETAIL THERE I WILL TOUCH ON SOME OF THE SAME THEMES TO DAY BUT I REALLY WANT TO COVER ENERGY AND THE IMUNE SYSTEM AND IF YOU'RE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN STRESS PURSE AND STRESS REGULATION PLEASE SEE THE EPISODE ON STRESS OK SO WE HAVE CORTESALL AND WE HAVE EPINEFFRENT AND THEIR NET EFFECT IS TO INCREASE ENERGY SO FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO GIVE YOU A TOOL THAT WILL HELP YOU REGULATE CORTESALL AND CAN ALSO HELP STAVE OLF CERTAIN PATTERNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS NOW OF COURSE IT'S NOTIN A CURE MENTAL ILLNESS ON ITS OWN BUT IT CAN SUPPORT HEALTHY STATE OF MIND AND CAN HELP REDUCE ON HEALTHY STATES OF MIND INCLUDING DEPRESSION SO THE FIRST TOOL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HIGHEST LEVELS OF CORTISALL ARE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP ONE WAY OR ANOTHER EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS YOU WILL GET AND INCREASE IN CORISALL THAT IS NON NEGOTIABLE THAT IS WRITTEN INTO YOUR GENO THAT INCREASING CORTESALL IS THERE TO WAKE YOU UP AND TO MAKE YOU ALERT ITS TO STIMULATE MOVEMENT FROM BEING SLEEP PRESUME LY HORIZONTAL TO GETTING UP AND STARTING TO MOVE ABOUT YOUR DAY AND I'VE SAID IT BEFORE BUT I WILL SAY IT AGAIN THE BEST WAY TO STIMULATE THAT INCREASING CAORTISALL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IS THAT VERY SOON AFTER WAKING WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES OR SO AFTER WAKING GET OUTSIDE VIEWSOME SUNLIGHT EVEN IF IT'S OVERCAST GET OUTSIDE VIEUSOM SUNLIGHT NO SUN GLASSES NEVER LOOK AT ANY LIGHT SO BRIGHT THAT IT COADAMAGE YOUR EYES BUT DO THAT FOR TWO TO TEN MINUTES IF IT'S VERY BRIGHT TWO MINUTES IF IT'S NOT SO BRIGHT TEN MINUTES DO THAT BECAUSE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TIME THAT CORTIALL RELEASE TO THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY WHICH WILL IMPROVE THIS HAS BEEN BACK BY PUREVIEWED STUDIES IT WILL IMPROVE YOUR FOCUS IT WILL INCROVE IMPROVE YOUR ENERGY LEVELS AND IT WILL IMPROVE YOUR LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT WILL ALSO PREVENT A LATE SHIFT IN CORTESALL INCREASE AND LATE SHIFTED CARTESALL MEANING QUARTISALL THAT INCREASES AROUND EIGHT OR NINE P M IS A SIGNATURE FEATURE OF MANY DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS INCLUDING MAJOUR DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND THAT OF COURSE CORRELATES WITH THINGS LIKE INSOMNIA ET CETERA SO THAT A KEY TOOL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU ARE ALREADY DOING THAT B UT IT IS VITAL TO DO NOW I MENTION SUNLIGHT EVEN ON CLOUDY DAYS AND THEREARE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR THAT SO I WANT EF JUST BRIEFLY COVER THE DATA BECAUSE IN THE EPISODES ON SLEEP I TALKED ABOUT BRIGHTNESS OF LIGHT IN REGULATING QARTERS ALL AND SLEEP AND I TALKED ABOUT HOAT A MEASURE LUCKS BRIGHTNESS BUT I WAS NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH I REALIZE BASED ON THE QUESTIONS THAT I'VE RECEIVE SINCE THAT EPISODE SO HERE' S HOUT WORKS GOING OUTSIDE AND GETTING SOME SUNLIGHT REQUIRES THAT I ALSO TELL YOU HOW LONG AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS I'VE SAID LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW IS NOT AS GOOD IT TAKES FIFTY TIMES LONGER TO GET AS MUCH LIGHT ET CETERA ET CETERA MANY MANY QUESTIONS HAVE TOLD ME THAT I'M NOT BEING SPECIFIC ENOUGH SO I'M IN TO GIVE YOU THE DATA AND FROM THE DAY TO YOU WILL UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW LONG YOU NEED TO DO THIS EACH DAY ON A SUNNY DAY SO NO CLOUD COVER PROVIDED THAT THE SUN IS NOT YET OVERHEAD IT'S SOMEWHERE LOW IN THE SKY COULD HAVE JUST CROSS THE HORIZON R IF YOU WAKE UP A LILIT LATER CON BE SOMEWHAT LOW IN THE SKY BASICALLY THE INTENSITY OF LIGHT THE BRIGHTNESS IS SOMEWHERE ROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND LUCKS LUCKS IS JUST A MEASUREMENT OF BRIGHTNESS IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD THE AP LIGHT METER THAT IS A FREE AP THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT YOU CAN HOLD YOUR FINGER DOWN ON THE LOLL BUTTON THERE AND YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND AND IT WILL CONTINUOUSLY GIVE YOU A LUCKS READ OUT IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S NOT EXACT BUT IT'S PRETTY GOOD AND IT IS YOUR OCLOSSI HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TO LIGHT METER THE COMPANY ON A CLOUDY DAY IT'S ABOUT TEN THOUSAND LUCKS O C SO TENFOLD REDUCTION BUT BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT VERY BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND A THOUSAND LUCKS AND ORDINARY ROOM LIGHT IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED LUCKS AND IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW MUCH LIGHT SCATTER THERE IS SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE A VERY BRIGHT BULB SITTING RIGHT NEXT YOU THAT'S NOT GOING T DO THE JOB YOUR PHONE WILL NOT DO THE JOB NOT EARLY IN THE DAY TO GET THE CARTES ALL RELEASED AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME YOU NEED TO GET OUTSIDE SO LET'S JUST SET A COUPLE GENERAL PERAMETERS IF IT'S BRIGHT OUTSIDE AND NO CLOUD COVER THAT LIGHT CAN BE INDIRECT YOU DO'T HAVE TO BE STARING INTO THE SUN PLEASE DON'T DAMAGE YOUR EYES WE CAN'T REGENERATE THOSE NORANS YET AND RESTORE VISION THAT'S LOST BUT IF YOU HAVE TO BLANK THAT MEANS IT'S TOO BRIGHT IT'S FINE TO BLINK OF COURSE PLEASE DO IF YOU NEED TO GET OUTSIDE FOR TEN MINUTES OR FIVE MINUTES SHOULD SUFFICE BUT TEN MINUTES IS SURE TO SUFFICE IF IT'S A CLOUDY DAY DENSE OVERCAST YOU'RE PROBBLING A NEED ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES IF IT'S LIGHT CLOUD BROKEN CLOUD COVER ITS PROBABLY GOIN TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY MINUTES AND IF YOU CAN'T GET OUTSIDE OR YOU'RE OWN AN AERPLANE AND IT'S BRIGHT OVERHEAD ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS OR ORDINARY ROOM LIGHTS IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU ABOUT SIX HOURS OF LIGHT AND BY TIME YOU REACH THE MIDDLE OF YOUR SO WAKEFUL PERIOD IT'S TOO LATE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SHIFT YOUR CLOCK AND YOUR QUARTERS ALL WILL START DRIFTING LATER AND LATER THIS IS W IITS VITAL TO GET THIS LIGHT ON A REGULAR BASIS TO GET THAT CARTISAL RELEASED EARLY IN THE DAY THAT SETS YOU UP FOR OPTIMAL LEVELS OF ENERGY IT SETS YOU UP FOR GREAT SLEEP BUT TO DAYS NOT REALLY ABOUT SLEEP IT'S MORE ABOUT ENERGY THAT CARTIS ALL PULSE AND THE STRESS THAT YOU MIGHT FEEL EARLY IN THE DAY FROM HAVING A LOBIT EXTRA ENERGY THAT IS THE ENERGY THAT YOU WANT IN ORDER TO MOVE ABOUT AND LEARN AND DO AND DO VARIOUS THINGS THAT IS A HEALTHY LEVEL EOF ENERGY SO PLEASE TRY AND GET THAT SUNLIGHT IF IT'S WITHIN YOUR PROTOCALLS TO DO THAT AND TRY AND GET SUFFICIENT SUNLIGHT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AGAIN WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU TIME YOUR CARTISALL APPROPRIATELY NOW THROUGHOUT THE DAY YOU 'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT THINGS MOST OF YOU ARE NOT SPENDING YOUR ENTIRE DAY TRY TO OPTIMIZE YOUR HEALTH YOU KNOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE BUT MOST OF YOU HAVE JOBS AND YOU HAVE FAMILIES AND YOU HAVE COMMITMENTS LIFE ENTERS THE PICTURE AND PROVIDES YOU STRESSERS AND THOSE STRESSERS WHATEVER THEY MAY HAPPEN TO BE A DIFFICULT CO WORKER SOME DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT SOMETHING YOU DIN GET THE RAYS YOU EXPECTED OR YOU DIN' GET THE VACATION THAT YOU EXPECTED THOSE WILL CAUSE INCREASES IN CUARTIS ALL AN EPINEFERON THIS IS IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T HAVE THE THE LUXURY OF JUST HAVING THIS MORNING CARTISALL MHEN HAVING IT TAPER OFF YOU WANT THAT MAJOR CARTISAL EARLY IN THE DAY BUT THEN YOU CAN EXPECT YOU SHOULD EXPECT INCREASES IN CARTISAL AND A DRENALIN THROUGHOUT THE DAY BASED ON EVENTS THAT ARE UNPLEASANT TO YOU SO FOR ME THE EVENTS THAT ARE MOST UNPLEASANT TO ME ARE THINGS LIKE TRAFFIC ON EMALES THAT ASK ME TO FILL OUT A FORM FOR WHICH I CAN'T FIND THE LINK THESE KINDS OF THING STRESS ME OUT O'M A HUMAN BEING I DON'T LOSE MY COOL OVER THEM BUT I CAN FEEL MY LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND CON OF FRUSTRATION INCREASE THE NORMAL KIND OF THINGS THAT GO ASTRESS TENTS UP A LITTLE BIT THE KEY IS THESE BLIPS AND CARTISAL AN EPINEFERAN NEED TO BE BRIEF YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM SO OFTEN OR LASTING SO LONG THAT YOU ARE IN A STATE OF CHRONIC CARTISAL ELEVATION OR CHRONIC EPIN EFERAN ELEVATION THIS SYSTEM OF STRESS WAS DESIGNED TO INCREASE YOUR ALERTNESS AND MOBILIZE YOU TOWARDS THINGS GET YOU FRUSTRATED AND PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DESIGNE TO DO SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF GETTING STRESSED AND STAYING STRESS THERE ARE GREAT TOOLS THAT WE PROVIDE IN THE STRESS EPISODE THAT RELATE TO THINGS LIKE THE DOUBLE IN HAL EXHAILE THE SO CALLED PHYSIOLOGICAL SI YOU CAN INCORPORATE IN ANESTY ARE A NON SLEEP YOU PRESS PROTOCAL ET CETERA BUT UNDERSTAND THAT THE ENERGY THAT YOU EXPERIENCE STRING STRESS THAT SUDDEN INCREASE IN A LERTNESS AND ATTENTION THAT COMES FROM SEEING SOMETHING DIFFICULT THAT IS AT HEALTHY HORMONAL SYSTEM IN NERL SYSTEM THAT'S WORKING AND THE REASON IT WORKS IS THAT CARTISALL WHEN IT'S RELEASED INTO THE BLOOD STREAM IT ACTUALLY CAN BIND TO RECEPTERS IN THE BRAIN IT CAN BIND RECEPTORS IN THE EMIGDOLA FIEUR CENTERS AND THREATN DETECTIONS CENTERS BUT ALSO AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN LEARNING AND MEMORY AND NERAL PL LASTICITY AND THIS IS WHAT I SAY THAT NORAL PLASTICITY THE BRAINS ABILITY O CHANGE ITSELF IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE IS FIRST STIMULATED BY ATTENSION IN FOCUS AND OFTEN A LOW LEVEL STATE OF AGITATION SO UNDERSTAND THAT AND YOU WON'T BE QUITE SO TROUBLED ABOUT THE LITTLE STRESS INCREASES THAT YOU EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THE DAY NOW THERE ARE WAYS TO LEVERAGE STRESS EPINEFRON AND CORTIS ALL IN WAYS THAT SERVE YOU AND TO DO IT IN A DELIBERATE WAY THEREARE ALSO WAYS TO DO THAT THAT INCREASE YOUR LEVEL OF STRESS THRESHOLD MEANING THEY MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT EPINEFRN AND CORTISALL WILL BE RELEASED SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF THOSE PRACTICES CAUSE I GET ASKED ABOUT THESE PRACTICES A LOT THINGS LIKE WHIMHOFF BREATHING WHICH IS ALSO CALLED TUMO BREATHING THINGS LIKE ICE BATHS THINGS LIKE HYH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE UTILITY THE QUESTION IS HOW YOU USE THEM AND HOW OFTEN YOU USE THEM THOSE TOOLS JUST LIKE STRESS FROM A LIFE EVENT CAN EITHER ENHANCE YOUR IMMUNITY OR TO PLEAD IT THAT'S RIGHT THOSE SAME PRACTICES OF ICE BATHS TUMO BREATHING HYGH INTENTSY INTERVAL TRAINING OR TRAINING OF ANY KIND CAN DEPLETE YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM OR IT CAN IMPROVE THEM EXCUSE ME THEY CAN IMPROVE IT MEANING THEY CAN IMPROVE YOUR MUN SYSTEM THE KEY IS HOW OFTEN YOU USE THEM AND WHEN AND SO I WANT TA REVIEW THAT NOW IN LIGHT OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE BECAUSE IN DOING THAT YOU CAN BUILD PRACTICES INTO YOUR DAILY OR MAYBE EVERY OTHER DAY ROUTINE THAT CAN REALLY HELP BUFFER YOU AGAINST UNHEALTHY LEVELS OF CORTIS ALL NEPINEFERAN MEANING CORTIS ALL INCREASES THAT ARE MUCH TOO GREAT OR THAT LAST MUCH TOO LNG EPINFERON INCREASES THAT ARE MUCH TOO GREAT OR THAT LAST MUCH TOO LONG AND OF COURSE WE'LL TALK ABOUT ALL THE NEGATIVES THAT GO ALONG WITH HAVING TOO MUCH CORTIS ALL TOO MUCH EPONEFERAN FOR TOO LONG BUT YOU HEAR ABOUT THOSE A LOT YOU HERE ABOUT CUSHING CYNDRUM YU HEAR ABOUT OBDOMINAPHATIC ACCUMULATION YOU HEAR ABOUT SLEEP DISTURBANCES I WANT TO ARM YOU WITH THE TOOLS FIRST AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE DARK SIDE AND ALL THE THINGS THAT HOPE FUL YOU'LL BE ABLE TO AVOID ENTIRELY OR THAT YOU CAN GET YOURSELF OUT OF ONCE YOU HAVE THE TOOLS IN HAND LET'S SAY SOMEBODY TELLS YOU SOMETHING VERY TROUBLING OR YOU LOOK AT YOUR PHONAND YOU SEE A TEX MESSAGE THAT'S REALLY UPSETTING TO YOU THAT WILL CAUSE AN IMMEDIATE INCREASE IN EPINFRON ADRENALAN IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND CHANCES ARE IT'S GOING TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF CORTIS ALL AS WELL LET'S SAY YOU GET INTO AN ICE BATH OR A COLD SHOWER EVEN IF YOU LOVE THE COLD OR IF YOU HATE THE COLD THAT WILL CAUSE AND ACQUIVALENT INCREASE IN EPINEFRON AND CORTISALL WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT LEVELS BUT IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME LET'S SAY YOU GO OUT FOR HIGH INTENSTHE INTERVAL TRAIN YOU DECIDE YOU'R GOING TO RUN SOME SPRINTS YOU DO SOME REPEATS OR YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOME WEIGHT LIFTING IN THE GIM AND YOU LOVE LIFTING WEIGHTS IN THE GIM AV YO LIKE THE POWER LIFTING THING OR YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO DO SOME OT YOGA OR SOME THING THAT YOU REALLY ENJOY OR YOU HATE YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE YOUR EPINEFRON AND CARTISAL LEVELS THERES SIMPLY NO WAY AROUND THIS LET'S SAY YOU DECIDE TO SIT DOWN AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOME DEEP BREATHING I'LL HEARE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF DEEP BREATHING SO INHAL EXAL IN HEL EXAIL YOU ARE GOING TO GET BIG INCREASES IN EPINEFRON AND CUARTISAL THE DATA FROM MULTIBL STUDIES SUPPORT THIS ALL OF THOSE ARE STRESSERS IN AEROQUOTES NOW THERE IS A WAY THAT YOU CAN COGNITIVELY REFRAME WHAT THOSE ARE YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF I LOVE HIGH INTENSE THE INTERVAL TRAINER I LOVE WAIGHT TRAINING OR NOW I PERSONALLY LOVE EXERCISE I NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE COLD I DO SOME COLD EXPOSEYUR STUFF NOW AND AGAIN ANDWERE CAN TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT IN THE OPTIMAL WAY IN AN UPCOMING EPISODE BUT YOU KNOW GETTING INTO THE COLD DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO ME I TELL MYSELF IT'S GOOD FOR ME AND I ENJOY IT AT SOME POINT USUALLY WHONE'M GETTING OUT ALL OF THOSE INCREASE EPINEFRON AND GUESS WHAT THEY INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF ENERGY AND ALERTNESS SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO STRUGGLS WITH ENERGY AND ALERTNESS IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL PROVIDED YOU GET CLEARENCE FROM YOUR DOCTOR TO HAVE SOME SORT OF PROTOCOL BUILT INTO YOUR DAY WHERE YOU DELIBERATELY INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF EPINEFRON AND YOU'RE LEVELS OF CARTISAL AND I WANT TO PUT THE EMPHASIS ON DELIBERATELY SO HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT WELL IT'S QUITE EASY TO TURN THE SHOWER COLD AND GET INTO THAT THAT WILL WAKE YOU UP AND IT LITERALLY WAKES YOU UP BECAUSE OF INCREASES IN EPINEFRON YOU CAN DO DEEP BREATHING OF THE SORT WHERE YOU INHAL AN EXAL REPEATEDLY TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY TIMES MAYBE HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR A FEW SECONDS ON AN EXAL AND THEN REPEAT SO CALLED WIMHAL FOR TOM OF TYPT BREATHING LOTS OF A DRENNLIN IS RELEASED IN YOUR SYSTEM WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU WILL HAVE MORE ENERGY AFTERWARDS SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THE BODY DOESN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A TROUBLING TEXT MESSAGE ICE TUMO BREATHING OR HIG INTENSTHE INTERVAL TRAININ YOUR ANY OTHER KIND OF EXERCISE IT'S OLLSTRESS COGNIVELY REFRAMING THAT AND TELLING YOURSELF I LIKE THIS I ENJOY IT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT THAT MOLECULE IMPACTS YOUR BODY IN BRAIN I A CHUCKLE BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO AS SAY OH THIS IS GOOD FOR ME NO WHAT IT DOES TO TELL YOURSELF THAT IT'S GOOD FOR YOU OR THAT YOU ENJOY IT IS IT THAT IT LIBERATES OTHER MOLECULES LIKE DOPOM DOPAMIN AND SERETONAN THAT HELP BUFFER THE EPINEFRON RESPONSES NOW THE WAY THAT DOES THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUS EPISODET ALL JUST MENTION THET DOPAMINE IS THE PRECURSE OR TO EPINEFRON EPINEFRON ADRENALIN IS MADE FROM DOPAMIE I CARTISAL IS MADE FROM COLLESTERAL EPINEFRON IS MADE FROM DOPAMIE AND THAT'S WHY IF YOU TELL YOURSELF YOU'RE ENJOYING SOMETHING AND BECAUSE DOPAMINE IS SO SUBJECTIVE THAT YOU CAN IN SOME WAYS AS LONG YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY LYING TO YOURSELF YOU CAN GET MORE EPINEFERON YOU GET MORE MILAGE OR MORE ABILITY TO PUSH THROUGH SOMETHING AND YOU CAN SORT OF REFRAMEENT BUT IT'S NOT REALLY COGNIVERY FRAMING THE COGNAE PART IS THE TRIGGER BUT THE IT'S A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE THAT'S ACTUALLY OCCURRING THERE IT'S DOP AMEN GIVING YOU MORE APINEFEREN A BIGGER AMPLITUDE EPERONEFRAN RELEASE AND IT GIVES YOU SOME SENSE OF CONTROL SO HERE'S A PROTOCAL THAT ANY ONE CAN USE IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE LEVELS OF ENERGY IF YOU SUFFER FROM LOW ENERGY DURING THE DAYTIME OR WHENEVER IT IS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE ALERT PICK A PRACTICE THAT YOU CAN DO FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY MAYBE EVERY DAY BUT MAYBE EVERY THIRD DAY OR EVERY FOURTHDAY MAYBE IT'S AN ICE BATH OR A COLD BATH MAYBE IT'S A COLD SHOWER MAYBE IT'S THE SICLIC IN INHAL EXHAL BREATHING PROTOCOL I DESCRIBE IF THAT WASN'T CLEAR AND POPLE IS ASKE FOR A DEMOO NOT CAN DO THE WHOLE THING RIGHT NOW BUT I'M WILLING TO DO A FEW ROUNDS OF THIS OR A YOU CYCLES I SHOULD SAY SO IT'S INHAL IW WOU DO THAT MORE DEEPLY MORE LIKE YOU DO THAT TWENTY FIVE THIRTY TIMES REPEATEDLY YOU WILL START TO FEEL WARM PEOPLE IN THE YO GET COMMUN THEY SAY YOUR GENERATING HEAT YO'RE NOT GENERING HEAT RELEASING A DRENOLINE INHALE ANT EXAL INHAL EXALE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY TIMES YOU WILL FEEL AGITATED IN STRESS THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE RE LEASING A DRENOLIN IN YOUR BODY AND NHAT'S BECAUSE YOURE RELEASING NOR EPINEFEREN IN YOUR BRAIN AND YOU'LL BE MORE ALERT THEN YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREATH CYCLES WITH AN EXHAL HOLD AND HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR FIFTEEN TO THIRTY SECONDS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS DO THIS ON DRY LAND NEVER WHILE DRIVING OPERATING HEAVY MACHINERY ALL THE STANDARD SAFETY PROTOCALS NEVER NEAR WATER PLEASE PEOPLE HAVE PASSED OUT AND DIED DOING THIS WITH BREATH HOLDS IN WATER THERE'RE SEVERAL DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH IT ON LAND IT'S PROBLY SAFER CLEAR WITH YOUR DOCTOR BUT TWENTY FIVE THIRTY BREATH EXHAL HOLD TWENTY FIVE THIRTY BREATHS AGAIN EXHAL HOLD TWENTY FIVE THIRTY BREATHS AGAIN EXHAL HOLD AND THEN IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN DO AN INHALE AND HOLD IF THAT'S WITHIN YOUR MARGINS OF SAFETY SO IF ALL THESE PROTOCALS ALL THESE ACTIVITIES ARE JUST EQUIVALENT THEY'RE JUST STRESS THEN HOW DO WEU MAKE THEM GOOD FOR US HOW DO WE ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THEM NOW OF COURSE THE COLD ITSELF CAN HAVE SOME HEALTH PROMOTING EFFECTS IT CAN INCREASE BROWN FAT THORMAGENESISAM MATABOLISM HIGH INTENTS THE INTERVAL TRAINING OR OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE OF COURSE HAS CARTY OF ASCULAR EFFECTS THAT CAN BE GOOD FOR US AS DOES WAIT TRAINING ET CETERA BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE WAYS TO INCREASE ENERGY AND TO TEACH OUR BRAIN AN BODY TO TEACH OURSELVES HOW TO REGULATE THE STRESSRSPONSE SO IN ADDITION TO THE BENEFITS OF THE ACTUAL PRACTICES WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BUILDING A SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN EPINEFERAN AND QUARTES ALL FROM LIFE EVENTS YOU'RE ABLE TO BETTER BUFF FOR THOSE AND WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT WAYS HAT YOU CAN INCREASE ENERGY OVER ALL CAUSE THAT'S WHAT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALL ABOUT ENERGY IN THE MUN SYSTEM AND INDEED WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEVERGE SPECIFIC PROTOCALS TO INCREASE EUREMUNE SYSTEM ON DEMAND THEREIS GREAT SCIENTIFIC DATED TO SUPPORT THAT ONE CAN DO THAT SO THEREIS A BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO DO THOSE THINGS INCREASE ENERGY AND YOURMIUN SYSTEM ON DEMAND LEARN TO BUFFER STRESS ON DEMAND IN A REAL TIME AND IT MEANS TAKING THESE PROTOCALS THESE PRACTICES WHETHER OR NOT IT'S COLD WATER OR ICE BATH OR EXERCISE OR ANY OF THOSE AND MAKING ONE SMALL BUT VERY POWERFUL ADJUSTMENT IN HOW YOU PERFORM THEM BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT I CAN'T JUST TELL YOU THE ADJUSTMENT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE MECHANISM SO THAT YOU KNOW IF YOUR DOING IT CORRECTLY OR NOT THIS IS REALLY CASE WHERE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF MECHANISM YOU WILL BE FAR BETTER OFF THEN JUST ADOPTING PROTOCALS SO IF YOU TAKE AWAY NOTHING ELSE FROM THIS EPISODE EXCEPT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU PLEASE TAKE AWAY THE INFORMATION I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU CORTISALL AS I MENTION IS RELEASED FROM THE ADRINALS AND IT CAN BIND TO RECEPTERS IT CAN HAVE ACTION BOTH IN THE BODY AND IN THE BRAIN IN FACT IT CAN BIND THE SO CALE THREAT DETECTION CENTER IN THE BRAIN OR ONE OF THEM WHICH IS THE EMIGDULA ALSO CALL THE FEAR CENTER IT CAN DO THAT BECAUSE QUARTUSALL CAN CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER CAN BE RELEASED IN THE BODY AND CROSS THIS BIOLOGICAL BARRIERS LIKE OFFENCE THAT KEEPS THINGS OUT OF THE BRAIN BUT CORTISALL HAS PASSING RIGHTS IT CAN GO THROUGH EPINEFERON CAN NOT EPINEFERON IS POLARIZE THE SHAPE OF IT IS SUCH THAT IT CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S RELEASED BOTH FROM THE ADRINALS IN YOUR BODY EN RELEASED FROM THIS BRAINSTEM AREA THE LOCUS SERULIOUS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT'S A POWERFUL THING BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE BODY CAN EN TERSTATES OF READINESS AND ALERTNESS WHILE THE MIND REMAINS CALM THAT IS BIOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE IT'S NOT JUST HA PSYCHOLOGICAL TRICK AND THEIR WAYS THAT ONE CAN DO THAT SO I'M PRESUMING AT THIS POINT THAT YOURE GETTING YOUR MORNING LIGHT TO TIME YOUR CORT IS ALL INCREASE I'M PRESUMING THAT YOU WANT MORE ENERGY OR THAT YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND IT'S ABILITY TO COMBAT INFECTIONS OF VARIOUS KINDS AND WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT YOU PICK FROM THE PALATE OF EXERCISEES THAT ARE OUT THERE OR TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE TO INCREASE EPINEFFERENT THERE LOTAWAYS TO DO THAT YOU CAN DO THAT AS I MENTION THROUGH COLD WATER THROUGH EXERCISE YOU CAN EVEN DO THAT BY HAVING CONFRONTATIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE AT A BIOLOGICAL LEVEL IT IS IDENTICAL SO IF YOU LIKE TO GO ON LINE AND PLACE THE KIND OF COMMENTS THAT WERE READ THE KINDS OF THINGS OR LOOK AT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT AGITATE YOU YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE LOOK AT THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER IN MUCH UNLESS DESTRUCTIVE WAYS FRANKLY BUT THE PREREQUISITE HERE IS GETTING AN INCREASE IN A DRENALINE RELEASED FROM THE BODY NOW THE SIMPLEST WAY TO DESCRIBE HOW TO DO THAT WOULD BE IN THE CONTACT OF COLD WATER OR A BREATHING PROTOCOL BECAUSE THEN I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE UNKNOWN LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT GET YOU TRIGGERED OR I COUN TELLYOU IT GETS ME TRIGGERED BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SO LET'S PRESUME COLD WATER SO LET'S SAY YOU DECIDYOU CAN TAKE A COLD SHOWER YOU GET INTO THE COLD SHOWER AND IF IT'S COLD ENOUGH THAT WILL BE STRESS WILL YOULL EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN EPINEFFERON IT WILL INCREASE YOUR ALERTNESS NOW YOU USING THIS AS A PRACTIS AS A TOOL TO BUILD YOU COULD CALL IT RESILIENCE BUT THE ABILITY TO STAY CALM IN THE MIND WHILE BEING STRESSED IN THE BODY EPINEFERENCE IN THE BODY AND YOU DO THAT BY SUBJECTIVELY TRYING TO CALM YOURSELF NOW YOU CAN DO THAT BY TELING YOURSELF IT'S GOOD FOR YOU BY EMPHASISEING YOU'R EXSHALS ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO TRY AND STAY CALM DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU ARE IN A HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERTNESS YOU DO THIS WITH EXERCISE YOU CUL DO THIS WITH MUSIC PRETTYO MUCH ANYTHING THAT WILL GIVE YOU A REALLY HEIGHTEND STATE OF ALERTNESS OFFERS YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND STAY CALM IN THE MIND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AT A MECHANISTIC LEVEL IS TO HAVE A DRENALINE RELEASED FROM THE ADRENALS BUT NOT HAVE A DRENALINE EPINEFRON RELEASED FROM THE BRAINSTEMP TO THE SAME DEGREE SO YOU'RE NOT JUST TRYNG TO BUFF FOR THIS YOU'RE NOT TRANSIY OH THIS IS GOOD FOR ME THAT IS GOOD FOR ME OMIN A GRYING THIS OUT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO GRIND IT OUT YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE THROUGH THIS CALMLY WHILE MAINTAINING ALERTNESS YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO ZOWN OUT NECESSARILY ALTHOUGH MAYBE THAT HELPS YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DISTRACT YOURSELF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DOU IS SHIFT COGNIVELY YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE SOMATIC TO THE BODY STRESS RESPONSE NOW I'M SURE SOME OF YOU OUT THERE ARE SHOUT AND YET THAT'S EXACTLY LIKE WHATEVER WHATEVER WHAT I AGREE THIS IS IN MANY WAYS A SELF DIRECTED KIND OF STRESS AND OCULATION BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS AS STRESS ANDOCULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AS A WAY TO INCREASE ENERGY AND FOCUS AND THE REASON IS THAT EPRINEFERON WHEN RELEASED IN THE BODY HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND WHEN RELEASED IN THE BRAIN HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE ABILITY TO LEARN AND REMEMBER INFORMATION AND TO BE ALERT AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPLITTING THE LOCATION SEPARATING THE LOCATION FROM WHICH YOU HAVE EPINEFERAN A DRENALIN RELEASED OCHE SO LET'S SAY YOU ARE DOING THIS PRACTICE SIMPLY TO WAKE UP OKEY COLD CHOWER WILL DO THAT EXERCISE WILL DO THAT THE ABILITY TO STAY CALM IN MIND WHILE HAVING HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF A DRENALIN AND PRESUMELY CARTES ALL AS WELL IN THE BODY BUT THE CORZELLS CAN A CIRCULATE EVERYWHERE WILL TALK LOBIT ABOUT CORIZLE MORE IN A MOMENT YOU COULD DO THAT THROUGH SOME SELF SOOTHING CALMING WAY THATS CAN BE HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL HOU DO IABY TELLING YOURSELF YOU INJOY IT ET CETERA BUT WHAT YOU NEEDS UNDERSTAND IS THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE PERIOD FOLLOWING THAT PRACTICE YOUR SYSTEM YOUR ENTIRE BRAIN AN BODY ARE DIFFERENT YOUR BODY IS ACTUALLY PRIMED TO RESIST INFECTION WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF EPINPERAN IN IT FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME SO THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY THAT EXPLORED HOW INCREASING A DRENALINE IN THE BODY CAN IMPROVE AMUNE RESISTANCE IS GROUNDED IN A WELL KNOWN PHENOMENON THAT INCREASES IN STRESS ACTUALLY PROTECT YOU AGAINST INFECTION IN THE SHORT TERM SO I WANT A LOOK AT THE CLASSIC DATA FIRST DESCRIBE WHAT WAS DONE AND THEN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MORE RECENT STUDY WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE THERE ARE CLASSIC SET OF STUDIES THAT A REALLY BASED MAINLY ON THE WORK OF SOMEBODY NAMED BRUCE MCCUWAN WHO IS AT THE ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK BRUCE PASSED AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO BUT HE HAD MANY DECADES OF INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL WORK UNDER HIS BELT WHEN HE DID THE WORK THAT IMAN TALK ABOUT NEXT HAS BEEN DONE IN HUMANS AND HAS BEEN DONE IN ANIMALS AND HAS REALLY EXPLORED HOW INDUCING STRESS CAN ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF THE MUNE SYSTEM IN THE SHORT TRM AND WHEN I MEAN SHORT TERM I MEAN ABOUT ONE TO FOUR DAYS I NO CHING GO THROUGH ALL THE DETAILS OF THE STUDY BUT ESSENTIALY WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS EXPOSING SUBJECTS TO SOME SORT OF INFECTION EITHER BACTERIAL OR VIRAL INFECTION AND INDUCING STRESS SOME LIKE A DOUBLE WAMMIRIGHT YOU THINK THAT MAY BE GETTING A LITTLE ELECTRIC FOR CHALK OR COLD WATER EXPOSURE WHOR SOMETHING TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF STRESS AND ADRENALANE WOULD JUST MAKE THE EFFECTS OF THE INFECTION WORSE BUT NO QUITE THE OPPOSITE BRIEF BOUTS OF STRESS WHICH NOW YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS AF CORTIS ALL AN EPINEPERAN RELEASE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO INCREASE IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION NOW THAT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE YOU IF YOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW EPINEPERAN WORKS IN THE BODY AND IN THE BRAIN IT ESSENTIALLY IS THE SIGNAL BY WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN IN FORM AMMUNORGANS THINGS LIKE THE SPLEEN AND OTHER ORGANS THAT MAKE KILLER CELLS OF VARIOUS KINDS BECELLS IN TECELLS TO GO IN COMBAT INFECTIONS BACTERIA ENVIRASES HOW ELSE WOULD YOUR EMUNE SYSTEM KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN INFECTION YOUR MAN SYSTEM CAN RECOGNIZE FOREIGN INVADERS BUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM PROVIDES THE SIGNAL THE SORT OF ALARM SIGNAL THAT LIBERATES THE KILLER CELLS THAT TELLS THEM THERE'S A PROBLEM AND TO GO SEEK OUT THE PROBLEM SO TO SPEAK SO THE DURATION HERE IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF STRESS STAYED TOO HIGH FOR TOO LONG THEN YES INDEED STRESS KAN HINDER THE IMUNE RESPONSE BUT FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT ONE TO FOUR DAYS IT ACTUALLY CAN PROTECT YOU BY WAY OF INCREASING THE IMUNE RESPONSE NOW I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THAT EFFECT IS GOVERNED BY EPINEFRON A DRENALINE RELEASED FROM THE ADRENALS AND NOT FROM THE BRAIN BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY EXPLORED WHETHER R NOT THE EFFECT EXISTS IN THE PRESENCE OF WHAT'S CALLED AND A DRENELECTOMY OR REMOVING THE ADDRINALS SI SHOU TO SAY WITHOUT THE ADDRENALS YOU DON'T GET THE EFFECT SO WE KNOW THAT THAT EFFECT COMES FROM A DRENALINE IN THE BODY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOU THAT MEANS IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM IN THE SHORT TERM YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR EPINEFERAN IN THE SHORT TERM THAT'S WHY SHORT BOUTS OF VERY INTENSE EXERCISE PROBABLY KNO MORE THAN AN HOUR PER DAY PROVIDED YOUR DOING EVERYTHNG ELSE RIHTE SLEEPING IN NUTRITION ET CETERA MAYBE EVEN SHORTER BOUTS OF INTENSE EXERCISE OR EXPOSURE TO COLD WATER OR THE SICLIC BREATHING THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE BECAUSE THEY INCREASE EPINEFERON THEY WILL BOLSTER THE AMUNE SYSTEM AND WE ALL HEAR THESE REPORTS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SEEMS TO BE THE THING THAT EVERANCE WHILE THEY'L BE AN ARTICLE ABOUT HOW COFFEE CAN IMPROVE YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM OR SELINA THAT INDEED CAFFINE CAN INCREASE EPINEFERAN AND DOPAMINE TO SOME EXTENT BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE DRINKING IT CHRONICALLY SO IT'S EFFECTS ARE PROBABLY DUE TO INCREASES AN EPINEFERAN AND PROBABLY WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING LIKE COFFEE OR OTHER FORMS OF CAFFINE CAN IMPROVE OR DEGRADYOURIMUE SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY DEPEND ON WHETHER NOT YOU'R USING IT I IN A WAY THAT IT INCREASES YOUR DRENALINE AS A SPIKE THAT HAPPENS RARELY YOU ONCE EVERY YOU ON'T TWO OR THREE MONTHS YOU LET SAY YOUHAVE AN INFECTION COMING ON YES INDEED IT PROBABLY WHAT THESE DATA PROBABLY MEAN IS THAT DRINKING SOM HOT CAFFINA TO TEA OR SOME HOT COFFEE EVEN PROVIDE YOU DON'T GET TEHYDRADED FROM IT CAUSE YOU'R ALSO DRINKING SOME WATER CAN PROBABLY IMPROVE YOURMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION BY WAY OF INCREASING A DRENALINE RELEASE BUT SO CAN THE BREATHING SO CAN COLD EXPOSURE SO CAN EXERCISE THE MECHANISM HERE IS WHAT'S KEY AND I KEEP SAYING THAT BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO KNOW THE SPECIFIC PROTOCOL I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY DO THIS PARTICULAR PROTOCOL YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AND IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SHORT TERM A DRENALINE INCREASING BEHAV IOUR YOUR WILLING TO DO ON A REGULAR BASIS EVERY DAY OR TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK NOW YOU COULD SAY WHILE I'M NOT SICK SHOULD I BE DOING THESE THINGS OFTEN YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK AT A MINIMUM IF YOUR GOAL IS TO KEEP YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM TUNED UP AND YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF A LOT OF CHILDREN FOR INSTANCE WHICH CARRY A LOT OF A BUGS BECAUSE THEIRMUNE SYSCTEM IS ENDEVELOPED OR YOU WORK IN A HELFCARE SETTING OR YOU'RE SIMPLY SOMEBODY WHO'S PRONE TO GET SICK I CAN JOU SAY ANECDOTALLY I GUESS SOME ONE NOW CALLS THIS ANIC DATA WHICH I DON'T LIKE THAT HRASE BECAUSE IT SORT OF A I DON'T WANT ANECDOTAL DATAS IT EVER BE A MISUNDERSTOOD AS ANYTHING BUT ANECDOTAL DATA ANECDOTALLY I CAN SAY THAT I'VE HAD INSTANCES WHERE I'VE FELT TAT YOU KNOW A THROAT TICKL COMING ON OR SOME SCINESS IN INFECTION I WILL DO THE SYCLIC BREATHING THAT I DESCRIBVE BEFORE  TWENTY FIVE THIRTY BREATHS EXCEPT WHOLE TWENTY FIVE THIRTY BREATHS EXCEPT WHOLE TWENTY FIVE THIRTY BREATHS EXCEPT HOLD THAN THAN BIG IN HAIL HOLD AND MOST TIMES I DIDN'T GET FULL BLOWN SICK BUT I ALSO TAKE OTHER PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES TO GET SLEEP ET CETERA SO WHETHER NOT IT WAS CAUSAL OR WHETHER NOT JUST CORRELATED I DON'T KNOW HOWEVER THERE'S A HUMAN STUDY THAT I DEFLLY WANT O POINT OUT TO YOU BECAUSE IT IT WAS PUBLISHED MORE RECENTLY THAN THE MACUAN WORK IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE PROCEENGS ON THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOR THE U ESSAY BECAUSE THEIR PROCEEDINGS THE NATIONAL ACADEMY A SCIENCE S FOR MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS VOLUNTARY ACTIVATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THE SYSTEM THAT CAUSES FIDOR FLIGHT AND A C STRESS AND CAUSES RELEASE OF A DRENNALIN AN ATTENUATION OF THE ANATE ME IN RESPONSE IN HUMANS THIS IS COX CA O EX AT ALL P N A S PROCEEMS THE NATIONAL CADEMYA SCINCIS TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND THEY CORPORATE THE EVER FAMOUS WIMHOFF BREATHING WEMOFF BREATHING IS MUCH LIKE THE BREATHING PROTOCAL THAT I'AVE DESCRIBED SEVERAL TIMES NOW IN THIS PODCAST TS ALSO CALL TUMO BREATHING OTHER PEOPLE FROM OTHER CULTURES IN COMMUNITIES HAVE CALLED IT OTHER THINGS THE NAMING REALLY ISN'T IMPORTANT ALTHOUGH I DO THINK WOMEN AS A PIONEER IN TRYING TO BRING THESE PRACTICES TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC MORE BROADLY AND WAS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY THE SITY WAS DONE IN THE NETHERLANDS IT WAS COMMUNICATED BY A DOCTOR THOMAS HORVATH THAT YALE I MENTION ALL THAT A HORVATHAS IS A TERRIFIC A SCIENTIST AN FAMILIAR WITH HIS WORK OVER MANY YEARS HERE'S WHAT THEY DID THEY INJECTED PEOPLE WITH ECOLIE AND THEY HAD GROUPS THAT EITHER DID THE SORTS OF BREATHING I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING THAT INCREASE TE DRENALIN RELEASE ALTHOUGH I SHOULD SAY I DON'T THINK YOU NEED THAT BREATHING TO GET A DRENALIN RELEASE YOU COULD DO WITH COLD EXPOSURE YOU COULD DO IT WITH OTHER THINGS HIGH INTENS THE INTERVAL TRAINING AS WELL AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE RESPONSE TO THE COLIE WAS QUITE DIFFERENT IN THE PEOPLE THAT HAD A PROTOCAL IN THIS CASE BREATHING TO INCREASE TE DRENALIN SO THIS IS A REMARKABLE STUDY BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE FEVER THE VOMITING T ALL THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ECOLIE MANY OF THEM IN SOME CASES ALL OF THEM WERE GREATLY ATTENUATED BY WAY OF INGAGING THE ADRENALIN SYSTEM THIS CASE USING BREATHING THEY LOOKED AT IN FLAMMATORY SIDEOF KINDS THINGS LIKE ILE SIX WHICH I'VE MENTION MANTIMES ON THIS PODCAST THIS OR CLASSIC AND FLAMATORY SETICAND WERE REDUCED THINGS LIKE ILE TEN WHICH ARE ANTIME FLAMMATORY WERE INCREASED THERE WERE SOME INFLAMMATORY SAT AT KINDS THAT WERE INCREASED WHAT'S THE POINT HERE THE POINT IS YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM BY FINDING AWAY THAT YOU CAN INCREASE A DRENALINE AND THIS RUNS COUNTER TO WHAT WE ALWAYS HERE WHICH IS DON'T GET TOO STRESSED OR YOU WILL GET SICK LEARN TO CONTROL A DRENALINE TURN IT ON AND TURN IT OFF LEARN TO CONTROL CORTISALL TURN IT ON WITH LIGHT IN THE MORNING TRY AND TURN IT OFF AND THEN WHEN I SPIKES BECAUSE OF LIFE EVENTS LEARN TO TURN IT OFF LEARNING TO TURN ON AND OFF A DRENALINE A K EPINEFERON AND LEARNING TO TURN ON AND OFF CORTESAL AFFORD TO YOU THE ABILITY TO TURN ON ENERGY AND FOCUS AND YOUR MAN SYSTEM THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT FROM TO DAY'S PODCAST AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PROTOCAL YOU USE MAYBE IT'S A CUP OF COFFEE  AND RUNNING UP A HILL FIVE OR SIX TIMES THAT WILL IMPROVE YOUR MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IF YOU GET A DRENNALINE IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU CAN USE A ICE BATH YOU CAN USE A COLD BATH IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN GET INTO AN ARGUMENT BUT I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO THEN SHUT OFF THAT RESPONSE AND THERE WAYS TO DO THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS OF EPINEFERAN AND CORTESALL THAT OCCUR BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTIONS ON THE BRAIN BECAUSE THESE ARE MANY AND THEY ARE POWERFUL AND THEY RELATE TO ENERGY BUT ALSO THE ABILITY TO LEARN IF I HAVENA'T ALREADY CONVINCED YOU THAT SEEING LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY IS GOOD FOR TIME IN YOUR CORTISALL I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT ANOTHER HORMONE THAT I DISCUSS LAST EPISODE WHICH IS THIEROID HORMONE AND IS CRITICAL FOR SETTING YOUR LEVEL OF METABOLISM IS CONTROLLED IN PART BY THESE CIRCADIAN MECHANISMS AND CORTIS ALL ITSELF THE SHORT TAKE AWAY ON THIS IS THAT IF YOU GET YOUR CORTISALL RELEASE EARLY IN THE DAY IT WILL INCREASE YOUR ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT WILL ALSO TIME YOUR FHIEROID RELEASE PROPERLY SO THERE IS YET ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO GET THAT LIGHT EXPOSURE EARLY IN THE DAY FOR ME THAT'S A NON NEGOTIABLE PRACTICE IF I'M ON A PLAIN I'LL TRY AND GET IT ANYWAY I CAN OM I'M NOT SHINING FLASHLIGHTS IN MY EYES YET BUT I REALLY TRY HARD TO GET THAT LIGHT EXPOSURE FROM SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY WITHOUT FAIL AND THE FIROID INCREASE HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK ITSELF IS REGULATED BY CORTISAL AND THE CIRCADEANG CLOCK TIMES THE RELEASE OF FIEROID HARMON I DON'T WAN TO GO TOO FAR OFF IN THAT DIRECTION BUT THE'RE A NUMBER OF STUDIES CAWL'S B AT ALL K  LL THAS B E E K AT ALL TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IF YOU WANT TA LOOK AT UP ON PUBMED IS IT A GREAT ONE THAT DESCRIBES HOW CORTES AL SECRETION BEGINS TO RISE JURING SLEEP AND PEAKS SHORTLY AFTER WAKING OR IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND THAT TIMES A SET OF NURONS IN THE CIRCATING CLOCK THEN TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF THE RELEASING AND STIMULATING HORMONES FOR THIROID SO A REALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISM AND FIROID WILL ALSO TEN TO CORRELATE WITH ENERGY BUT MOSTLY METABOLISM VERY IMPORTANT HAVE THIEROID IN CHECK NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT EPINEPRON AND CORT IS ALL AND LEARNING AND MEMORY EVERYONE HAS A STORY ABOUT BEING SO STRESS THEY CAN REMEMBER SOMETHING YOU MU SIT DOWN TO AN EXAM I SHOULD HAVE THIS HAPPEN ONCE SAT DOWN TO AN EXAM AND IS BLANKED JUST BLANKED I'V IT ONLY HAPPEN ANCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED I DON'T THY KNOU A SLEEP DEPROVATION BUT I JUST COMPLETELY BLANKED AND IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO PULL MYSELF OUT OF THAT DITCH I DID MANAGE TO DO IT BUT IT WAS A SCARE EXPERIENCE SO I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT ISTRESS AND AN INABILITY TO PERFORM HOWEVER MOST OF THE TIME INCREASES IN EPINEPRON PROVIDED THEY ARE NOT THROUGH THE ROOF LEAD TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE NOW THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON MEMORY TESTS ON LEARNING NEW INFORMATION ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE THAT WHEN BLOOD LEVELS OF EPONEPRON ARE LOW YOU DON'T PERFORM VERY WELL WHEN BLOOD LEVELS OF EPONEPRON ARE VERY HIGH UP TO ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED O SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PEKAGRAMS FOR PERMILL IF YOU ANY ONE'S OUT THERE OS ITRY MEASURING THE STUFF BUT I DOUBT YOU ARE PERFORMANCE GOES WAY UP PERFORMANCE GETS BETTER WHEN YOU ARE ALERT AND WHEN YOUARE A LITTLE BDISTRESSE ABSOLUTELY SHOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IF YOU GET TOO STRESSTD IT'S THE MENTAL SIDE IT'S THE EPONEPRON IN THE BRAIN THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO EITHER FOCUS ON THEIR SOMATIC RESPONSE TOO MUCH LIKE THEY FEEL LIKE THEIR SWEATING IN THEIR FOCUSED ON THEIR BODILY RESPONSIVE NOT FOCUS ON WHAT IT IS THEI'RE TRYING TO DO OR SAY OR PERFORM ET CETERA OR LEARN BUT EPINEFRAN IS A NEUTROPIC IT IS A SMART DRUG THAT WE ALL MAKE INTERNALLY AND CORTIS ALL IS AS WELL NOW HERE'S THE TWIST THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU WANT EPINEFRON HIGH JURING THE EXAM NECESSARILY MEMORY AND LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE ARE ACTUALLY FAVORED THEY ARE ENHANCED BY EPINEPRAN INCREASES IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEARNING AND NOT SOMETHING THAT'S RARELY DISCUSSED THE TIMING IS VITAL SO IF YOU LEARN SOME INFORMATION YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION YOU ARE TRYING TO LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE AND NEU MOTOR SKILL WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN THE INCREASE IN EPINEPRON THAT OCCURS JUST AFTERWARD IS WHAT'S GOING TO CONSOLIDATE THE INFORMATION IT'S GOING TO INSURE THAT THE PROPER CIRCUITS AND MECHANISMS IN THE BRAIN FOR NERO PLASTICITY ARE ENGAGED DURING SLEEP LATER THAT NIGHT OR THE NEXT NIGHT WHICH IS WHEN THE REAL REWUIRING OCCURS NYOU MIGHT SAY THT'S CRAZY WHY WOULD THAT HAPPEN WELL WE HAVE TO REMEMBER NONE OF THESE MECHANISMS EVOLVED FOR US TO DO WHAT WE WANT AND LEARN WHAT WE WANT NECESSARILY ALTHOUGH THEY WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCE THIS BEFORE WE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN UP GONE OUTSIDE GET IN OUR CAR DRIVE TO WORK OR TO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT MUCH AT ALL AND THEN ALL F A SUDDEN YOU SEE AN ACCIDENT ON THE ROAD YOU'RE ALERTNESS IS PRIMED IF ITS APPENS BE A PARTICULARLY GORY ACCIDENT THERE'S CAN BE A LOT OF SENSORY INFORMATION THERE ALLOF A SUDDEN ADRENALIN EPINEFRON IS RELEASED INTO YOUR BRAIN IN BODY GUESS WHAT NOT ONLY WILL YOU NOT FORGET THAT EVENT BUT YOU WILL REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT LED UP TO THAT EVENT WHICH HAS AN ADAPTIVE FUNCTION BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN AND BODIES PRIMARY CONCERN IS SAFETY RIGHT THIS IS THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR MASLOW'S HIRE GIVE NEEDS IS SAFETY FIRST AND SO YOU HAVE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AND A LERTNESS FOR EVERYTHING THAT PRECEDED THAT SPIKAN A DRENALIN N END QUARTISALL SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU NEED TO LEARN SOMETHING BETTER IF YOU ARE TAKING ATARALL OR YOUR TAKING A LOT OF COFFEE BEFOREHAND YOURE ACTUALLY DRIVING THE PROCESS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION YOURE INCREASING EPINEFERAN FOR LEARNING SURE BUT PAST A CERTAIN POINT YOU'R ACTUALLY DEGRADING LEARNING IN PERFORMANCE THE TIME TO DO THAT IS TOWARD THE END OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE LEARNING BECAUSE THIS MECHANISM IS NOT SIMPLY DEVOTED TO NEGATIVE EVENTS LIKE A CAR CRASH OR A TRAMA IT WORKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HYPPOCAMPUS THAT IN CODES MEMORIES AS PART OF THE MEMORY INCODING MECHANISMS IS PRIME THAT IT'S TOLD WHAT YOU JUST EXPERIENCED IS IMPORTANT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THAT INFORMATION LATER AND SO I'VE TALKED MANY TIMES BEFORE ABOUT YUSING NONSLEEP DEE BREAST AND ESSTIAR OR INSURING GOOD NIGHT SLEEP AFTER LEARNING BUT WHAT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT IS AS THE LEARNING EVENT TAPERS OFF AS YOUR EXIDTING THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR EPINEFRON LEVELS ARE NOT TAPERING OFF AS WELL AND THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE NINETY MINUTE CYCLE THIS SO CALL ALL TRADEIN CYCLE FOR LEARNING WORKS BECAUSE IT TAKES A FEW MINUTES TO GET INTO RHYTHM OF LEARNING OU CAN MAINTAIN THAT ALERTNESS FOR ABOUT NINETY MINUTES S NO QUINCIDENCE THAT THESE PODCASTS OR TYPICALLY ABOUT NINETY MINUTES LONG AND AS YOU EXIT THAT NINETY MINUTES YOUR STON GOING TO START TO FEEL FATIGUED YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SECRETE EPINEFRANT AT THE SAME LEVEL SO I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT AT THE END OF THIS PODCAST YOU SHOULD GIVE YOURSELF A FOOTSHOCK OR THAT YOU SHOULD JUMP INTO AN ICE BATH ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY IF YOU WERE TO INCREASE YOUR EPINEFERAN AT THE END OF THIS EPISODE BY BREATHING OR BY WAY OF COLLDSHOWER I'M WILLING TO BET BASED ON NUMEROUS PUBLISHED STUDIES THAT THE MEMORY FOR THE INFORMATION WOULD BE ENHANCED BECAUSE OF THIS WRETCH OR ACTIVE EFFECT OF EPINEFERAN IN QUARTISAL BUT SIMPLY YOU CAN REMEMBER THINGS BETTER IF YOU INCREASE YOUR ALERTNESS ACH YOUR LEVEL OF EPINEFFRT AN CORTISAL AFTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO LEARN SO M REMINDED BY PEOPLE HERE AT THE HUBURMAN LABPODCAST THAT THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY THEREFOR WOULD BE A NINETY MINUTE SESSION OF FOCUS OR LEARNING THEND IMMEDIATELY AFTER COLD SHOWER OR TUMOTIHT BREATHING OR ICE BATH OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT MAY BE A HARD RUN OR HIT TRAINING IF YOU CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THE OTHER THINGS AND THEN SHOWER UP AND DO IT NON SLEEP DEEP REST AND THEN GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP THOSE WOULD BE THE OPTIMAL TOOLS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF TOOLS FOR ENHANCED LEARNING AND OF COURSE YOU COULD USE CAFFINE TO CRIME THE WHOLE PROCESS BY DRINKING THE CAFFINE TOWARDS THE TALE OF THE LEARNING EPISODE WHICH IS COUNTER INTUITIVE AT LEAST TO ME I SHOULD MENTION SINCE MANY OF YOU USE CAFFINE AND I USE CAFFIN I DO DRINK COFFEE I  MUSHROOM COFFEE I LOF A MATE I DRINK CAFFINE IN VARIOUS FORMS THAT THERE WAS A STUDY THAT CAME OUT RECENTLY THAT IS RELEVANT TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT ENERGY AND ALERTNESS AND LEARNING AND THE STUDY CAME OUT JUST RECENTLY MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT'S MAGHALAS AT ALL SO M A G A L H A E S AND IT WAS PUBLISH IN MOLECULAR PSYCHAETRY WHICH IS A FINE JOURNAL APPURE REUJOURNAL AND THE TITLE PREY MUCH GIVES IT AWAY HABITUAL COFFEE DRINKERS DISPLAY A DISTINCT PATTERN OF BRAIN FUNCTIONAL CONACTIVITY CRONICALLY DRINKING COFFEE CHANGES BRAIN CONCTIVITY AND IT DOES IT IN A NUMBER OF WAYS BUT THE K TAKE AWAYS FROM THIS STUDY AS IT RELATES TO SORT OF WHAT THE CIRCUITS DO AS IT PUSME JUST LISTENING OFF A BUNCH OF BRAIN CIRCUITS WHICH CON A MEANINGLESS IN THIS CONVERSATION IS THAT PEOPLE WHO DRANK COFFEI HABITUALLY EVERY DAY HAD CHANGES IN THEIR BRAIN CIRCUITRY SUCH THAT THERE WAS A SHIFT OR A BIAS TOWARD ANXIETY EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T INJEST CAFFI SO LATIMES WE THINK O CAFFINE INCREASES YOUR LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND INDEED IT APPEARS IT DOES IF YOU USE IT CHRONICALLY BUT NOT JUST TO CAFFINE IT DOESN'T JUST RAISE YOUR BASE LINE OF ANXIETY BECAUSE OF WHAT CIRCULATING IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM IT ACTUALLY INCREASES CONUCTIVITY BETWEEN THE BRAIN AREAS THAT RELATE TO ANXIETY NOW THAT COULD BE A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE ARE PRONE TO PA YOU KNOW CHRONIC PANIC ATTAKS ARE ANXIETY TECTS THATS NOT CAN BE GOOD SOME PEOPLE MIGHT USE CAFFINE IN HEALTHY WAYS I BELIEVE I DO IN ORDER TO JUST INCREASE OVER ALL LEVELS OF ALERTNESS ALTHOUGH NOW NOT ONLY AM I GOING TO START DOLAYING MY CAFFINE AND TAKE TILL TWO HOURS AFTER I WAKE UP FOR REASONS I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN PREVIOUS EPISODES BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO START DRINKING T LATER IN LEARNING AND FOCUS SESSION S AS A WAY TO ENHANCE PLASTICITY AROUND THOSE LEARNING IN FOCUSESSIONS NOT BEFORE SO INTERESTING STUDY F OFREEDA ON ITS FREE ON LINE YOU CAN ACCESS THE FULL PAPER ON LINE WE WILL PUT A LINK AS WELL ONE A MENTION THIS THIS ISSUE OF NEUTROPIC SO CALLED SMART DRUGS WHICH IS NOT A TOPIC THAT I PARTICULARLY INJOY BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE NAME OUT DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF A NEUTROPIC BECAUSE WHAT IS A SMART DRUG WELL THERE'S DIFFERENT KINDS OF SMARK THERE'S CREATIVITY EITHERS TAT SWITCHING THEIR STRAGY BUILDING THEIR STRAGIUM PLIMENTATION AND MOST OF THE NEUTROPICS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE JUST COCKTAILS OF A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT AREN'T TAILOR TO THE INDIVIDUAL AT ALL THEY ALL SEEM TO HAVE SOME CAFINE OR SOME COLONERGIC STIMULATION ET CETERA BUT THEREIS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO FRAME THIS IN LIGHT OF TO DAY'S CONVERSATION NEUTROPICS GENERALLY FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE CATEGORY ARE NEUTROPICS THAT INCREASE BLOOD GLUCOS SO THESE ARE COMPOUNDS THAT PEOPLE TAKE THAT INCREASE BLOOD GLUCOS AN INCREASING BLOOD GLUCOS WILL INPROVE PERFORMANCE ENCAN ENHANCE LEARNING IN SOME SITUATIONS I'M NOT SUGGESTING PEOPLE TAKE THESE THINGS BUT HERE'S JUST A LIST OF A FEW OF THOS SOME OF THEM ARE LEGAL SOME OF THEM ARE GRAY MARKET SOME OF THEM ARE ELEGAL PARACTAMS OXERACITAMS THE ENERACITAMS ALL THE TAMS OKHE ELEVATE BLOOD GLUCOS THAT'S HOW THEY WORK THE NERAL EFFECTS THAT YOU HEAR ARE SECONDARY OR TURCIARY TO THE FACT THAT THEY JUST INCREASE BLOOD GLUCOS WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE IF YOU BLOCK THE BLOOD LUCOS EFFECT YOU BLOCK THE NEUTROPIC EFFECT OCE OTHERS INCLUDE AND DEFLING DON'T TAKE THESE PLEASE AMPHETAMINE COCANE THOSE WILL NCREASE LEARNING IN THE TRORT CARM IN PARTICULAR DOSAGES BUT BECAUSE THEY INCREASE BLOOD GLUCOS AND THEN OF COURSE THINGS LIKE PAINFUL STIMULE OR STRESS WILLING PROVE LEARNING BY WAY OF INCREASING BLOOD GLUCOS NOW STRESS AND EPINEFERAN THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH IT NOT ONLY IMPROVE PERFORMANCE JURING THE LEARNING BOUT BUT AS I MENTION BEFORE HAVING UP AN EFFRAN COME UP AFTERWARD WILL INCREASE THE RETENSION OF THAT INFORMATION IN THE LONG TERM AND THEN OF COURSE IS WHOLL CATEGORY OF NEUTROPICS THAT DON'T IMPACT BLOOD GLUCOS THAT WORK BY INCREASING THE COLONERGICS SYSTEM ACTIVITY AND THESE ARE THINGS LIKE COLINE LECATHEN FOSISTIGMINE AS THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOSILDITAL STERINE SO THER RE WAYS TO INCREASE ENERGY THAT DON'T REQUIRE INCREASING BLOOD GLUCOS AND THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THE REASON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EPINEPRAN AND CARTES ALL FOR INCREASING ENERGY AN IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IS BECAUSE THEY ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF BLOOD GLUCOS OF COURSE THEY INTERACT WITH THAT SYSTEM BUT WE HEARD SO MUCH GROWING UP YOU NEED TO EAT FOR ENERGY BUT THE ENERGY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY IS ASHIA MUCH MORE POWERFUL ONE THAN THE ONE THAT YOU DERIVE FROM FOOD IT'S WE COULD CALL IT NERAL ENERGY IT'S NER TRANSMITTERS THAT CREATE ALERTNESS AND FOCUS AND THE WILLINGNESS AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE AND THE WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY FOR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO MOVE IN RESPONSE TO INTRUDERS SO I THINK WE ALL TOO OFTEN THINK ABOUT FO OD AS ENERGY WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE IT IS BUT THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT ARE NURL AND THEY RELATE TO THESE HORMON SYSTEMS CORTISALL AN EPINEFERON AND THAT'S WHAT WERE FOCUSED ON TO DAY SO UP UNTIL NOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT INCREASING ENERGY AND INCREASING THE IMMUN SYSTEM BY WAY OF CORTISALL AN EPINEFERAN BUT I'D BE TOTALLY REMISS IF I DIDN'T COVER HOW CORTISALL AN EPINEFERAN IF CHRONICALLY ELEVATED OR IF ELEVATED TOO HIGH CAN HAVE A LOT OF DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS THESE ARE THE THINGS WE NORMALLY HEREABOUT I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THOSE THINGS BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT WAYS TO AMELIORATE THEM WAYS THAT YOU CAN ADJUST THE CORTIS ALL LEVELS EVEN IF YOUR STRESSED WAYS THAT YOU CAN ADJUST EPINEFERAN LEVELS EVEN IF YOUR STRESSED SO THAT THEY HAVE LESS OF A NEGATIVE IMPACT I DON'T HAVE TO LIST OFF ALL THE WAYS THAT STRESS IS TERRIBLE AND HRONIC STRSS IS TERRIBLE I THINK YOU KNOW INSOMNIA YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM OVER TIME WILL GET BATTERED AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIGHT INFECTION OFFIS WELL MIGHT YOU DON'T WANT TO BEE STRESSED FOR TOO LONG YOU CAN START LAYING DOWN THIS OR CLASSIC PATTERN OF CORTISALL INDUCED BODY FACT IN FACT THERE IS A WHOLE LITERATURE RELATED TO COMFORT FOODS AND WHY WE WANT TO CONSUME COMFORT FOODS UNDER CONDITIONS OF CHRONIC STRESS AND IT'S QUITE INTERESTING ACTUALL BECAUSE IT REVEALS SOMETHING ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF CHRONIC STRESS THAT'S IN FORMITIVE FOR HOW TO PREVENT IT OR TO DOWN REGULATE CHRONIC STRESS ONCE ITS OCCURRED SO TET'S TALK FOR A SINGNG ABOUT COMFORT FOODS AND THE WORK THAT IAM GOING TO REFER TO IS WORK THAT WAS DONE BY A VERY IMPRESSIVE SCIENTISTS BY THE NAME OF MERRY DALMAN HER WORK GOES BACK DECADES SHE WAS AT UNIVERSILY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND SHE ASK THIS QUESTION THAT ON THE FACE OF IT SEEMS KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO MECHANISM KNOWN UNTIL MARRY AND HER LAB PERSONAL CAME ALONG THE QUESTONA AS WHY DO WE SEEK HIGH FAT AND OR HIGH SUGAR FOODS WHEN WE ARE STRESSED FOR A WHILE WHY WOULD THAT BE AND THE REASON IS THAT THE SO CALL GLUCCUCORTICOIDS OF WHICH CORTIS ALLIS A GLUCCOCORDICOID IT'S CAUSES WE'VE MENTION BEFORE BY RELEASING HORMONS FROM THE BRAIN AN I C T H FROM THE PRETUITARY ET CETERA BUT NORMALLY HIGH LEVELS OF GLUCOCORTICOID SHUT OFF THE RELEASING HORMONS IN THE BRAIN AND IN THE PATUITERY THEY SHUT DOWN IN A  SO CALLE NEGATIVE FEED BACK LOUP SO JUST LIKE IF TESTOSTRON OR ESTROGEN GET TOO HIGH THAT'S RED OUT OR THAT IS SEEN SO TO SPEAK BY NURONS IN THE PATUITARIAN BRAIN AND THEN WE SHUT DOWN ARE PRODUCTION OF ESTERGEN AND TESTOSTRON IF CORTIS ALL LEVELS GET TOO HIGH THERE'S TOO MUCH CORTISAL FLOATING ROUND OUR BLOOD STREAM THERE'S A NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOUP AND THE BRAIN IN PETUITARY SHUT DOWN SE OR H AND A C T H WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE STIMULATE MOR CORTISAL SO CRTISALL LEVELS GO DOWN SO IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NEGATIVE FEE BACK LOOP CHRONIC STRESS HOWEVER STRESS THAT LAST MORE THAN FORE TO SEVEN DAYS AND THERE'S A WAY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CHRONIC TRESS REALLY IS IN ANACTIONABLE WAY CAUSES CHANGES IN THE FEED BACK LOOP BETWEEN THE ADRINALS AND THE BRAIN AND THE PETUITARY SUCH THAT NOW THE BRAIN IN THE PATUITARY RESPOND TO HIGH LEVELS OF GLUCOCORTICORTS CORTESAL BY RELEASING MORE OF THEM IT BECOMES A POSITIVE FEE BACK LOOP AND THAT'S BAD IT ACTUALLY GETS RIGHT DOWN TO LEVELS OF GENE REGULATION AND TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION AND SO YOU REALLY DON'T WANT CHRONIC STRESS BECAUSE IT'S A CASCADE OF STRESS EQUALS MORE STRESS EQUALS MORE STRESS SO THIS WHI ITS VERY IMPORTANT TO LEARN TO TURN OFF THE STRESS RESPONSE YOU DON'T WANT IT ELEVATED FOR TOO LONG SO THERE'S ONE STUDY THAT DOLMINER COLLEGUES DID WHERE THEY STIMULATE CHRONIC STRESS BY INCREASING CORTICAL STERON BUT CORTISALL AND THEY FOUND THAT SUBJECTS WOULDIN INCREASE THEIR CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR AND FAT IN FACT THEY WOULD EVEN EAT LARD IT WOULD JUST ITS SOUNDS DISGUSTING BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO JUST EAT MORE FAT AND MORE SUGAR AND THAT LEDS ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE TYTU DIABETES UM LED TO DISFUNCTION IN THE ADRENAL OUTPUT ET CETERA AND SO THE REAL KEY IS TO LEARN TO SHUT OFF THE STRESS RESPONSE BECAUSE THE INTERESTING THING IS IS THAT DALMINAN COLLEAGUES AND SOME STUDIES THAT FOLLOWED UP ON THEIR WORK FOUND THAT IF THE SYSTEM WAS KICKED INTO MOTION FOR TOO LONG THEND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS SHIFT OVER ALL TOWARDS ANXIETY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT BODY FAT ITSELF RECEIVES NURL ENERVATION IT RECEIVE NURONS ACTUALLY TALK TO BODY FATSON NOW YOU HAVE BODY FAT RELEASING CERTAIN HORMONS YOU'VE GOT THE ADRENALS RELEASING CORT CORTISALL AND ALL OF THAT IS FEEDING BACK TO THE BRAIN TO MAKE YOU WANT MORE SUGAR AND FATTY FOODS  THAT'S HOW THE SO CALL COMFORT FOODS WORK AND YOU SHOULD A WATCH YOURSELF NEXT TIME YOU EXPERIENCE STRESS IF IT'S A SHORT TERM BOUT OF TRESS TYPICALLY IT BLOCKS HUNGER IF IT'S A LONGER BOWED OF STRESS TYPICALLY IT TRIGGERS HUNGER IN PARTICULAR FOR THESE SO CALL COMFORT FOOD SUGARY AND FATTY FOODS AND IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING HOW SHORT TERM STRESS CAN ACTUALLY BLOCK HUNGER IT DOES THAT BY ACTIVE ATING OR INTERACTING WITH A SYSTEM CALLED THE BOMBEISIN SYSTEM BOMBISIN IS A PEPTIED HORMON A IT WAS ACTUALLY A I THINK WAS NAMED AFTER SOME SORT OF REPTILE SOMES IT OR ARE AMPHIBIANSCUSE ME SOME SORT OF TOAD I THINK IT WIS INITIALLY A SEQUENCE FROM THE TOAD BEFORE IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED IN HUMANS AND I THINK THE TOADS LATIN NAME IS A BOMBINA BOMBINA OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND SO THEY DECIDE TO CALL THIS THING BOMBEISIN BUT IT REDUCES EATING AND STRESS LIBERATES BOMBEESIN AND MAKES YOU WANT TO EAT LESS BUT CHRONIC STRESS CAUSES ALL THESE POSITIVE FEEBACK CHANGES WHICH ARE NOT POSITIVE THEIR POSITIVE I'M CALLING THE POSIT BECAUSE THEY AMPLIFY THE STRESS RESPONSE OVER AND OVER NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOU SO SHORT TERM STRESS GREAT LONG TERM STRESS REALLY REALLY BAD OTHER BAD EFFECTS OF STRESS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT AND I WON'T LIST OFF TOO MANY MORE OF THESE BECAUSE YOU KNOW SO MANY OF THEM YOU HEAREABOUT THEM YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THEM I 'M GUESSING IS THAT YES INDEED STRESS CAN MAKE YOU GO GRAY THE RATES AT WHICH PEOPLE GO GRAY MEANING GRAY HAIR SOME CASES GREAT BODY HAIR IS WELL DEPEND ON SOME GENETIC FACTORS THERE'S ACTUALLY THE THEIR COUPLE WAYS THAT WE CAN GO GRAY THE THERE'S ACTUALLY A STEMSELL WHAT THEY CALL NICHE IN EVERY PHOLICAL SEE OF STEMSELLS IN THE FOLICAL THAT CAN PRODUCE MORE AND MORE OF THE GIVEN HAIRCELL AND THEIR ACTUALLY PAROXIDE GROUPS YEU KNOW WE HEREABOUT BLEACHING HAIR WITH PROXITE LEAS AND THE EIGHTIES ELL AS A THING BUT YOU CAN USE HYDROGEN PROXITE TO BLEACH THINGS AND YOU CAN PRODUCE YOUR OWN PROXIDE IN THE HERPHOLICAL THAT WILL CAUSE THE HAIRS TO GO GRAY IN ADDITION PIGMENTATION OF HAIR JUST LIKE PIGMENTATION OF SKIN IS CONTROLLED BY MALANACITES OUR OLD FRIENDS THE MALANACITES AND I SAY OLD FRIENDS CAUSE ON PREVIOUS EPISODES I TALKED ABOUT WHY SUNLIGHT IN GETTING AMPLE SUNLIGHT CAN INCREASE LEVELS OF CERTAIN THINGS LIKE MALANACITE STIMULATING HORMONE WHICH REDUCE HUNGER IT CAN IMPROVE TESTOSTRONE AN ESTROGEN LEVELS AND ALL THE REASONS FOR THAT WELL TURNS OUT THAT ACTIVATION OF THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS REALLY JUST ANOTHER NAME FOR THE SYSTEM THAT LIBERATES A DRENALINE FROM THE ADRENALS AND EPINEPERAN IN THE BRAIN DRIVES DEPLETION OF MALANACITES IN HAIR STEMSELLS SO INDEED THERE'S A RADE OF AGING THAT WE WILL UNDERGO BASED ON OUR GENETICS BUT STRESS WILL MAKE US GO GRAY AND THE PAPER THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK TO IF YOU WANT TO READ MORE ABOUT THIS CAME OUT VERY RECENTLY THIS IS ZANGAT ALL Z H A N G AT ALL NATURE FABULOUS JOURNAL DIFFLLY ONE THET APEX JOURNALS TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS PAPER SHOW THAT THE ACTIVATION OF STRESS IN VARIOUS FORMS WILL DEPLEET THESE MALANACITE STEMSELLS YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AN ICE BATH OR HARD EXERCISE OR BREATHING INCREASING YOUR LEVELS OF STRESS TO THE POINT WHERE ITS CAN TO MAKE YOU GO GRAY WERE TALKING AGAIN ABOUT CHRONIC STRESS AND IF YOU WANT O OFFSET THE STRESS EFFECTS ON GRAYING OF HAIR YOU CAN DO THAT BY EITHER HAVING A PRACTICE THAT HELPS YOU REGULATE STRESS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS OF SOMETHING LIKE NONSLEEP DE BREAST OR MEDITATION YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO MACAGES OR  VACATIONS THOSE ARE GREAT BUT HAVING A PRACTICE TO KEEP STRESS CLAMPED SO THAT IT'S NOT CHRONICALLY ELEVATED THAT WILL BE GREAT AS WELL THIS IS ANOTHER CASE WHERE SUNLIGHT WE KNOW STIMULATES MALANACITES NOT JUST IN SKIN BUT IN HAIR AND SO GETTING AMPLE SUNLIGHT HAVING A PRACTICE TO REGULATE STRESS WILL OFFSET THE STRESSED INDUCED GRANG OF HAIRS BY WAY OF STRESS INDUCED DEPLETION OF MILANA SIHTES AND IF MILANASIT SOUNDS LOT LIKE MELINAN YOURE RIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE ANYTHING INVOLVED WITH PIGMENTATION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY GENERALLY HAS MELENO OF IN THE FRONT OF THE WORD AN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER SO IF CHRONIC STRESS IS SO BAD BECAUSE OF ITS EFFECTS ON EPINAPRAN AND CORTIS ALL BEING ELEVATED FOR TOO LONG THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES OF COURSE WELL WHAT'S CHRONIC STRESS HOW DO I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHRONIC AND ACECUTE STRESS AND HOW DO I KEEP CHRONIC STRESS AT BAY BECAUSE OF ALL THESE NEGATIVE EFFECTS A I AM EVEN LIST OUT THE NUMBER OF OTHER ONES THE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION OF WHICH CERTAINLY HAS A CORLET WITH ELEVATED CORTIS ALL THIROID HARMON SOCIATE LOW THIROID HARMONAS ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSION MISTIMED THIROID ONCE AGAIN GETTING YOUR LIGHT AND YOUR FEEDING AND YOUR EXERCISE AND YOUR SLEEP ON A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE OR CONSISTENT ISH IS GOING TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL THING YOU CAN DO IN ORDER TO BUFF FOR YOURSELF AGAINST NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH FOR THAT MATTER THERE ARE THINGS THAT ONE CAN TAKE SUPPLEMENTS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ET CETERA SOME OF YOU OUT THERE MAY HAVE OR MAY KNOW PEOPLE TO HAVE CUSHINGS WHICH IS CHRONICALLY ELEVATED CORTISALL THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT CAN BE USED BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH A SITUATION WHERE LIFE GET STRESSFUL THAN LESS TRESSFUL STRESSFUL THAN LESS TRESSFUL I WOULD SAY BASED ON THE DATA FROM MCCUAN AND OTHERS BOPSAPOLSKIS LAB OVER MANY YEARS I WOULD SAY ANY STRESS THAT LAST MORE THAN A DAY OR TWO DAYS OR THREE DAYS AS STARTING TO BECOME CHRONIC STRESS THRES REALLY NO STRICT CUT OFF BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MEASURING EVERYBODY'S CORTIS ALL FOR MOMENT A MOMENT MY LAB HAS DONE EXPERIMENTS WHERE WE MEASURE STRESSIND PEOPLE OVER TIME PEOPLE VERY TREMENDOUSLY IN THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE A REALLY HARD DAY AND THEN FALL DEEPLY ASLEEP THAT'S CGON TO BE THE ULTIMATE RESET IS THE ABILITY TO SLEEP WELL MORE OR LESS UNDISTURBED EACH NIGHT ALTHOUGH ONE OR TWO WAKE UPSTURING THE NIGHT PROBABLY NOT CAN BE TOO DETRIMENTAL PROVIDED THE'RE NOT TOO LONG AND YOU'RE NOT VIEWING LIGHT IN DURING THOSE WAKE UPS OR YOUR PHONE BUT THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN TAKE IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR CHRONICALLY STRESSED IN YOUR VERING TOWARD SOME OF THE NEGATIVEFFECTS OF STRESS ARE MANY THERE ARE SOME SIMPLE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO IN TERMS OF SUPPLEMENTATION ALL SUPPLEMENTS OF COURSE HAVE TO BE CHECKED OUT FOR THEIR SAFETY MARGINS FOR YOU BECAUSE IT CS AN DIFFRENT FROM PERSON A PERSON YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THEIR SAFE FOR YOU IF YOU DECI TO USE THEM ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ONES IS ASHUGONDA AND IT HAS A POWERFUL ANXILIOTIC ANT ANXIETY EFFECT YOURE WELCOME TO GO TO EXAN MANDOT CALM AND FOR ZERO COST YOU CAN SEE THEIR SO CALLED HUMAN EFFECT MATRICS ASHEAGANDA HAS MANY USES IT'S BEEN USED TO ENHANCE POWER OUTPUT IN ATHLETES IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO MODESTLY INCREASE TESTASTRON IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO MODESTLY ADJUST THINGS LIKE LOW DENSY LIKE APPROACHING COLESTRALL THE SO CALLED BAG COLLESTRALL IN QUOTES IT HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON ANXIETY THAT'S BEEN SHOWN IN NINE STUDIES NINE PURE REVIEWED INDEPENDENT STUDIES MEAN FUNDED BY ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE NO VESTED INTEREST IN THE ANSWER IT HAS A VERY STRONG EFFECT ON CARTISALL ITSELF HOWSTRONG THE DECREASING CORTISALL NOED IN HUMANS IS FOURTEEN POINT FIVE TO TWENTY SEVEN POINT NINE PER CENT REDUCTION IN OTHERWISE HEALTHY BUT STRESSED HUMANS THAT'S GRIAT SIX STUDIES SO THAT'S AND IT MENTIONS THIS THI SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN MANY OTHER SUPPLEMENTS NOW SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT TAKING ASHUAGANDA CHRONICALLY MAY NOT BE GOOD IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT OR YOU CAN POINT TO SPECIFIC STUDIES THAT INDICATE EXACTLY WHY IT'S NOT GOOD A PLEASE PUT IN THE COMMENT SECTION OR LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMEN SECTION ON YOU TOO WOULD BE BEST THE STUDIES IAM REFERRING TO DID EXPLORER BOTH GENDERS THE NUMBER O SUBJECTS WAS REASONABLY HIGH SIXTY FOUR OR MORE A ONE TO SIX MONTHS STUDIES TO THESE WERE LONG TERM STUDIES THAT'S GREAT YOU LIKE TO SEE THAT NOT JUST IN AN ACUTE STUDY SO MALES AND FEMALES LOTS OF DIFFERENT AGES AWEIGHT EXCUSE ME OVERWEIGHT AND NON OVER WEIGHT AM THEY DID BLOOD DRAWS OF CUARTESALL WHICH IS GOING AND AS WELL AS SALIVA TESTSALIVA'S ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE FREE CARTISALL ELS A MEASURE IT FROM ER WAX TURNS OUT WHICH SOUNDS PRE GROSS AM AND KIND OF IS BUT NONE THE LESS A THAT'S WHERE CORTISALL WILL ACCUMULATE IN ER WAX AND IN SALIVA THE FREE QUARTISALL A BUT THAT'S SIX VERY QUALITY STUDIES INDEPENDENTLY SUPPORTED THAT ALL POINT TO THES VERY SIGNIFICANT IU O FOURTEEN POINT FIVE TO TWENTY SEVEN POINT NINE PERCENT REDUCTIONS IN OTHERWISE HEALTHY ADULT SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS DEALING WITH CHRONIC TRESS IS TE STRESSFUL PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU WANT A STAVE OFF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF STRESS WELL THEN ASHEWAGANDA MAY AN ONE A HIGHLIGHT MAY BE RIGHT FOR YOU IT ALSO DOES TEND TO LOWER TOTAL CARTISALL WHICH IS INTERESTING A CAN LOWER DEPRESSION TO A SOMEWHAT MINIMAL DEGREE AND CAN LOWER AS I MENTION BEFORE THINGS LIKE A LODENSI LIPE EROPROTING O THAT I THINK ASHWAGANDA COMES THROUGH IS KIND OF THE THE HEAVY HITTER IN THIS DEPARTMENT NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ALSO IS THE OTHER EFFECTS OF ASCHEAGANDA THAT ARE DOWNSTREAM OF REDUCING CHRONIC STRESS AND QUARTIS ALL CASE CORTISALL HAS SO MANY EFFECTS TEF RECEPTORS FOR QUARTISAL ALL OVER THE BODY AND BRAIN AND SAW JUST LICITES OFF QUICKLY I'M NOT GONTO LISTOFF EACH STUDY OR TALK ABOUT HOW MANY SUBJECTS IN DETAIL AGAIN YOU CAN GO TO EXAMINED OT CALM IF YOU WANTIN JUST PUT IN ASCHUAGONDA SEE REACTIVE PROACING WHICH IS A MARKER OF ALL SORTS OF NEGATIVE HEALTH A EFFECTS CARDVASCULAR HEALTH EVEN MACULAR DEGENERATION IS NOTABLY REDUSED HEART PALPITATIONS NOTABLY REDUCED CYRUM T THREE AND T FOR OUR OLD FRIENDS THIROID HORMONS FROM A PREVIOUS EPISODE ARE INCREASED SYMPTOMS OF OC D DECREASED BOTH THE OBSESSIONS AND THE COMPULSIONS RIGHT OBSESSIONS AR O THE MINE COMPULSIONS ARE OF BEHAVIOR SO THERE ARE LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE DOWN STREAM OF REDUSING CARTESALL LOWERED HEART RATE LOWERED RATES OF INSOMNIA SLIGHTLY IMPROVED MEMORY WHY THAT WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE CORTISALL THE SHORT TERM CAN INCREASE MEMORY ON GUESSING ITS FROM INCREASE SLEEP DECREASE PAIN INCREASE QUALITY OO REDECREASE REACTION TIMES THINGS OF THAT SORT SO THE LIST GOES ON AND ON BUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS STEM DOWN STREAM OF DECREASE CORTISALL SO IF ONE WORD TO DECIDE TO TAKE ASHUAGANDA IN ORDER TO REDUSE CARTISALL GIVEN THAT YOU WANT CORTES ALL EARLY IN THE DAY TO HAVE ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE TIME TO TAKE IT AS PROBABLY LATER IN THE DAY OR IN THE EVENING I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT PREVENTING SLEEP OR CAUSING IN SOMNI OF ANY KIND THAT CERTAINLY WAS ENLISTED AS ONE OF THE MAJOR EFFECTS ON EXAMINED OT KALM I WILL TAKE ASCHUAGANDA FROM TIME TO TIME IF I'M CHRONICALLY STRASTR IF I'M NOT SLEEPING AS WELL AS I OUGHT TO YOU MIGHT THINK THAT WITH ALL MY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SLEEP AND SLEEP PROTOCALS AT I WOULD SLEEP PERFECTLY EVERY NIGHT BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A DOG THAT HAS A OF CANINE FORM OF OF SUNDOWNERS OF DIMENSHASOF HES UP MUCH OF THE NIGHT THESE DAYS A AN SO THERE'S NO WAY IM GETTING A SOLID NIGHT OF SLEEP LATELY AND SO I WILL SUPPLEMENT WITH ASCHUAGANDA ANTIPICALLY I'LL TAKE IT BEFORE SLEEP AND MAY BE ALSO WITH MY LAST MEAL OF THE DAY WHICH IS AT LEAST TWO HOURS BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP AGAIN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE IF IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU THE DOSAGES CAN VARY TREMENDOUSLY I W JUST GO BY WHATS OFF AWHAT'S ON THE BOTTLE FROM A REPUTABLE BRAND I WOULD ALSO CHECK OUT A EXAMINED OT COM BECAUSE IT MENTIONS A RANGE OF DOSTEGES THAT PEOPLE HAVE USED AN IN VARIOUS STUDIES TO DIFFERENT EFFECTS NOW THERE IS SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT SOME OF YOU MAY ACTUALLY BE TAKING OR INGESTING THAT CAN INCREASE CARTESALL AND NOT SO INCIDENTALLY CAN DECREASE ESTEROGEN AND TESTSTRON BECAUSE REMEMBER CORTESALL IS MADE FROM THE COLASTRO MOLECULE SO IS ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON SO AR ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRONESCUSE ME AND IT'S COMPETITIVE SO YOU'RE EITHER MAKING MORE CORTISALL ARE YOUARE MAKING MORE OF THIS EXSTORIED HARMONS ESTEROGEN AND TESTASTRONE BELIEVE IT ORE NOT LICERISH WHICH I WAYS THOUGHT OF AS A CANDY BUT LICERISH CONTAINS A SUBSTANCE THAT I CAN'T PRONOUNCE G EL WI SE WHY R R H IZEIEN GLIKE CERHISN A WHICH IS A OF THE GLABORA SPECIES OF PLANT ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF ITS CHEMISTRY THIS EIGHTEEN BATA HYDROXY SERITIC ACID YOU DON'T LY NEAN TO KNOW ALL THAT LIQUORISH BLACK LIQURISH CONTAINS A SUBSTANCE THAT INCREASES QARTISALL AND IT'S INCREASES NOT HUGE BUT IS IT IS SIGNIFICANT THIS HAS BEEN LOOKED AT IN FEMALES AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINE MALES AND FEMALES AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINE PEOPLE AGE THIRT THESE ARE SEPARATE STUDIES WHERE UMLISTING OFF THE TWREN AGES AGES THIRTY TO SIXTY FOUR TURNS OUT THAT YOU CAN SEE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN SERUM CARTISALL AND DECREASES IN TESTOSTRON AN ESTROGEN SO THAT WAS COMPLETE NEWS TO ME ALSO INCREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE THAT IRE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL THAT'S GOING TO BE DOWNSTREAM OF QUARTIS ALL INCREASING CORS ALS INCREASE BLOOD PRESSURE IN ORDER TO INGAGE THE STRESS RESPONSE PAR THIS STRESS REPONE INCREASED HORMONES OF OTHER KINDS AS BETTER ASSOCIATED WITH STRESSA WHO KNEW I DIDN'T KNOW MAYBE YOU KNEW A PREVIOUSLY IF YOU DID FORGIVE ME BUT LIQUORISH AND SOME OF THE COMPOUNDS IN BLACK LIQUORISH CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE STRESS PROBABLY NOT THE THING TO BE INJESTING DURING PERIODS OF CHRONIC STRESS WHETHER NOT ANY ONE HAS HAD POSIVE EFFECTS OF USING IT TO INCREASE CARTISALL IN OTHER CONTECTS LET ME KNOW BUT VERY INTERESTING THAT THE TEMISTRY AF LIQURISH INCREASES STRESS HORMONES AND THEREFORE YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO ALMOST CERTAINLY WE WANT TO AVOID IT IN CONDITIONS OF CHRONIC STRESS ALSO IF YOU TRYN T OPTIMIZE TOSTOSTRONE AND ESTROGEN LIQUORINGS LIKE A BAD IDEAIL I SUPPOSE ONE INSTANCE WHERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE LIQUORISH WOULD BE IF YOUR TRAVELING IN YOUR TRYING TO WAKE UP AT A PARTICULAR LOCATION BECAUSE LIQUORISH HAS THESE EFFECTS ON QARTISALL AND QARTISAL IS  ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAKING PHENOMENON AN ALERTNESS AND ENERGY YOU COULD USE IT IN THAT REGARD HOWEVER I WOULD BE CAREFUL THE TIME IT SO THA YOU'RE NOT GETTING TWO QUARTISALL INCREASES THROUGHOUT THE DAY TWO PEAKS SO YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING ALL THE OTHER THINGS CORRECT FOR JET LAG AND ADJUSTING TO JET LAG AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE INCLUDING TIMING YOUR FEEDING USING TEMPERATURE USING EXERCISE USING LIGHT TO A JUST OD JET LAG MORE QUICKLY PLEASE SEE THE EPISODE THAT WE DID ON JET LAG AND SHIFT WORK WHERE I COVER ALL THOSE PROTECALLS IN DETAIL THE OTHER COMPOUND THAT I THING DESERVES ATTENTION IS APIGENAN A P I G E N I N APIGENAN WHICH IS WHAT'S FOUND IN CEMOMILE APIGENAN I'VE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY IT HAS VARIOUS EFFECTS ONE IS IT IS A MILD ANTI ESTROGEN THAT'S BEEN SHOWN IN VARIOUS STUDIES AND IT DOES HAVE A BIT OF AN ANXILIOTIC EFFECT OF REDUCING ANXIETY I TAKE IT BEFORE BEDTIME FIFTY MILIGRAMS AGAIN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE OR FIGURE OUT IF THAT SAFE FOR YOU ERE NOT IM NOT SUGGESTING YOU TAKE IT THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ACTION IS TO CALM THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IT DOES THAT PRIMARILY BY ADJUSTING THINGS LIKE GABA AND CHLORI CHANNELS BUT ALSO HAS A MILD EFFECT AN REDUCING QUARTUSALL SO A SHOGANDA AND APIGENAN TOGETHER SORT OF A I WOULD CONSIDER THE MOST POTEN COMMERCIAL COMPOUNDS THAT ARE IN SUPPLEMENT NON PRESCRIPTION FORM THAT ONE COULD USE IF THEY WERE INTERESTED IN REDUCING CRONIC STRESS ESPECIALLY LATE IN THE DAY BY WAY OF REDUCING QUARTISALL LATE IN THE DAY SE ARE PROBABLY GETTING THE IMPRESSION THAT CORTISAL AN EPONEPRAN ARE BIT OF A DOUBLE EDGE SORD YOU WANT THEM ELEVATED BUT NOT FOR TOO LONG OR TOO MUCH YOU DON'T WANT THEM UP FOR DAYS AND AYS AND DAYS BUT YOU DO WANT TO HAVE A PRACTICE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEM IN THE SHORT TERM SO WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT PROTOCALS THAT CAN SET A FOUNDATION OF OF CARTISALL AN EPINEPERAN THAT IS HEADED TOWARDS OPTIMAL OPTIMIZATION IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A SERIES OF REGULAR PRACTICES THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY SO SLEEPING AT CERTAIN TIMES LIGHT IT SPECIFIC TIMES FOOD AT SPECIFIC TIME CERTAIN FOODS ET CETERA AND THAT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL BUT THERE ARE SOME UNIVERSALS AND WE'VE COVERED A NUMBER OF THOSE IN THE DISCUSSION TO DAY MEAL TIMING MEAL SCHEDULES HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON ENERGY LEVELS AND AS I MENTION BEFORE THE ENERGY UM REFERRING TO IS NOT GLUCOS ENERGY IT'S NOT BURNING CARBES WHILE RUNNING OR KEYTONES WHAT O'M TIME TAT IS NURL ENERGY EPINEPRAON AND CUARTISAL FASTING AND TIMING ONE'S EATING ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN SO EVEN IF YOU ARE ON A AND OF STANDARD THREE MEAL A DAY WITH A COUPLE SNACKS AN BETWEEN DIET OR NUTRICIAN REGIMEN YOU ARE FASTING WHENEVER YOUARE SLEEP ER YOU'RE NOT INGESTING ANY CALORIES SUNLESS YOU'RE HOOKED UP TO AN IVIE OF GLUCOS YOU ARE FASTING WHILE YOUR SLEEPING THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF FASTING THAT CAN RELATE TO EPINEFERON AND CARTISAL I WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ON OPTIMIZING FOOD IN TAKE FOR PERFORMANCE IN THE SPORTS CONTECT THAT'S COMING UP BUT IN THE MEANTIME IT LECT YOU JUST TALK ABOUT FASTING AS A SOURCE OF EPINEFERAN ANY TIME WHEN OUR BLOOD GLUCOS IS LOW CORTIS AL AN EPIN EPRON ARE GOING TO GO UP IF WE FAST FOR TOO LONG THAT IS STRESS THERE'S NO WAY ROUND THAT NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE OTHER BENEFICIAL EFFECTS RUNNING A MARITHON IS STRESS BUT IT CAN ALSO HAVE POUSIVE EFFECTS IF THAT'S YOUR THING SO STRESS HAS BEEN DEMONIZED AS A TERM BUT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT STRESS MECINISTICALLY AS EPINEFRON AND CARTISAL AND THEN IF WE DO THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW TO REGULATE ITS TIMING SO ANY TIME WE HAVE NAN EATEN FOR FOR TO SIX HOURS LEVELS OF EPIN EPRON AN QUARTISALL ARGON TO GO UP PRETTY SUBSTANTIALLY THERE'S AN EXCEPTION TO THAT WHICH IS IF YOU ARE USED TO EATING ON THE CLOCK EVERY TWO HOURS ARE EVERY HOUR BEING HALF HOUR LATE OR BEIN EVEN TEN MINUTES LATE ON THAT SCHADULE WILL INDUCE STRESS MOST OFTAT PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS BUT ALSO THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE GRELLEN THAT ARE GON TO MAKE YOU HUNGRY CAUSE THEY'RE ON THAT EATING CLOCK SO ONE THING THAT MANY PEOPLE DO TO GREAT BENEFIT IS THEY FOLLOW A SO CALLED CIRCATINE EATING SCHEDUL THEY EAT ONLY WHEN THE SUN IS UP THEY STOP WHEN THE SUN IS DOWN MORE OR LESS THE OTHER WAY THING ABOUT THIS IS THEY STOP EATING A COUPLE HOURS BEFORE SLEEP AND THEY EAT MORE OR LESS UPON WAKING ASSUMING THAT THEIR WAKING OUT MORE OR LESS AROUND THE TIME THE SUNRISES MAY BE PLUS ERMINUS TWO HOURS O CATS A SARE OF TYPICAL SCADUL NOW LET SAY YOU DECIDE TO DO WHAT I DO WHICH AS I SKIP BREAKFAST I DRINK WATER I DELAY MY CAFINE FOR NINEY MINUTES TO TWO HOURS AND THEN I DRINK MY CAFINE AND THEN MY FIRST MEAL IS TYPICALLY AROUND LUNCH TIME ELEVEN THIRTY OR TWELVE AND YES OCCASIONALLY I THROW BACKS OM ALMONS OR WALNUTS OR SOMETHING EARLIER IN THE DAY I THAT I DO DO THAT FROM TIME TO TIME AM  IF I GET HUNGRY ENOUGH OR IF I JUST HAPPEN TO SEE THEM I'M KIND OF A DRIVE BY EATER IF I SEE BLUEBERRIES OR NOTS OR SOMETHING I JUST GONT OF PICK HIM UP AND PUTTING IN MY MOUTH I TRY NOT DO THAT OFF OTHER PEOPLE'S PLATES BUT I JUST HAVE THAT HABIT OF DOING THAT FROM TIME TO TIME BUT TYPICALLY I DON'T EAT UNTIL ABOUT NOON SO I'VE GOT A CARTIS ALL INCREASE I'VE GOT MY SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNINGS IM GETTING A BIG PULSE AND ENERGY EARLY IN THE DAY AND YES THERE'S A LOBIT OF AGITATION I AM HUNGRY SOMETIMES EARLY IN THE DAY SOMETIMES KNOW BUT MY GRILLAN SYSTEM IS USED TO KICKING IN RIGHT AROUND NOON AT THE POINT WHERE I EAT AS LONG AS I DON'T EAT CARBOHYDRATE IN MY CASE I KNOW THAT MY EPINEFRAN LEVELS ARE GOING TO STAY PRETTY HIGH SO FOR ME IT'S USUALLY MEAT AND SALID OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT OR FISHING SALAD I DON'T PARICULARLY LIKE EATING FISH BECAUSE OF THE TASTE BUT I'M A SESHALLY LOW CARBOR KEETO ISH THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO I'M PROBABLY IN A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED STATE OF EPINFRT AN QUARTIS ALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY SOME OF YOU ARE FASTING EVEN LONGER YOU'RE PUSHING OUT TILL FOUR P M OR EIGHT P M OR MAY BE YOAR EVEN FASTING AROUND THE CLOCK ANY TIME YOUARE FASTING YOUARE INCREASING EPINEFRN AND QARTIS ALL RELEASE YOU CAN DO ALL THE MEDITATION IN THE WORLD TO KEEP YOUR MIND CALM BUT YOU ARE CLOSER TO THAT EDGE OF STRESS AND YOU'RE CLOSER TO THAT EDGE OF PEAKS STRESS SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT JUST IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE DESCRIPTION ABOUT COMFORT FOODS AND CARTIS ALL WAS ONE OF KIND OF AN EXTREME CASE WHERE CARTIS ALL SYSTEMS KICK OVER TO POSITIVE YE BACK LOUP BUT WE ALL EAT TO SUPPRESS CARTIS ALL AN EPIN EFERON WHEN WE'RE HUNGRY CORIS ALL NEPINEFRAN CREAT IN AGITATION SO WE GO SEEK FOOD WHEN WE INJEST FOOD THE TYPICALLY IF IT INCLUDES CARBOHYDRATE THERE'S A BLUNTING OF QUARTIS ALL THERES A BLUNTING OF APINEFFRON IN THE BLOOD STREAM IF YOU'VE EVER HAD TOO MUCH COFFEE TO DRINK AND YOU GO AND HAVE A COUPLE PIECES OF BREAD YOU WILL FEEL THE THE WE MIGHT DESCRIBE IT AS THE KCAFIN GETTING SOAKED UP AT O YOUR SYSTEM BUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING AS YOURE ELEVATING BLOOD GLUCOS WHICH IS MORE OR LESS SATURATING THE EFFECT OF CAFIN IN YOUR SYSTEM NOT COMPLETELY BUT IT'S GOING TO HAVE THAT EFFECT IF YOURE VERY STRESTING YOU SIT DOWN TO EATS ONE THNG IT WILL CALL YOU DOWN YES BECAUSE SOME OF THE BLOOD THAT GOES TO YOUR STOMACH BUT MORE SO BECAUSE THESE EFFECTS IN BLUNTIND QUARTIS ALL IN EPIN EFFERON SO THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE ALERT YOU CAN DO THAT BY WAY OF NOT EATING OF COURSE PLEASE INJEST FLUIDS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WATER FAST OUT THERE I AM YET TO SEE GOOD SCIENCE ON WATER FASTING AND WY THAT CAN STIMULATE STEM SELLS OR PEOPLE LOVE THE IDEA OF AFTER THE NOBLE PRIZE WAS GIVEN FOR AUTOPHAGY IN THE ES IDEA THAT OUR SELLS CLEAN UP DEBRIS IN CENTICEN SELLS YES THAT'S TRUE BUT THE ITIN THAT A WATER FASTING IS GOIN TO PROMOTE THAT I FIND RATHER AMUSING PLEASE SEND ME THE DATA IF YOU KNOW OF SOME GREAT STUDY IN A DECENT JOURNAL BUT PRETTY MUCH THIS IS SOMETHING I HEREABOUT I DON'T THINK WATER FASTING IS A GOOD IDEA NORSH OU BE DRINKING SO MUCH WATER ON THAT YOU KILL YOURSELF UNACTUALLY DRINK ENOUGH WATER THAT YOU O THAT YOU DIE SO I THINK IN JESTING WATER IN HEALTHY AMOUNTS IS A GOOD THING STAY HYDRATED BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE ALERT STAY HIDRATED CAFFIN MAYOR MAY NOT BE IN YOUR REGIMENT BUT FASTING WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LEVELS OF ENERGY ARE UP AND YOU WILL BE PRIMED VERY WELL FOR DOING A PROTOCAL OF THE SORT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN THIS EPISODE OF BREATHING OR COLD EXPOSURE OR EXERCISE TO GET THAT INCREASE IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND IF YOU DO THAT AFTER LEARNING AFTER TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHING IT WILL INCREASE LEARNING FOR THAT PARTICULAR SET OF INFORMATION WHETHER NO ITS MOTOR OR LANGUAGE OR WHATEVER T HAPPENS TO BE MATHEMATICS PROGRAMMING SO FASTING IS A TOOL FOR MANY REASONS CAN INCREASE GROWTH HORMONE ET CETERA BUT TO DAY I'M TALKING ABOUT FASTING IS A TOOL TO BIAS YOUR SYSTEM TOWARD MORE EPINEFERAN A DRENALINE RELEASE AND TOWARD MORE CORTIS ALL RELEASE BUT STILL LOW ENOUGH THAT IT'S NOT CHRONIC STRESS THAT IT'S NOT CAUSING NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS BUT PLEASE NO THAT IF LIFE IS VERY VERY STRESSFUL IF YOUR EXPERIENCING LOTS OF STRESSERS AND YOUR CHRONICALLY FASTING YOU ARE POSITIONING YOURSELF TOWARD A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CHRONICALLY STRESSED IN THE WAYS THAT ARE NEGATIVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS LOWER TESTOSTRON AN ESTERAN NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON I YOU'RE GING TO YOUR HEIRALTURN GREY THERE'S REASONS FOR THAT YOU ARE SLEEP WILL SUFFER YOURE IMUNE SYSTEM WILL SUFFER SO I THINK WHILE IT'S NEW AUNTS OUR DISCUSSION TO DAY ABOUT EPINEFERAN AND CORTIS ALL INCREASING ENERGY AND IMMUNITY ARE DESIGNED TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU SHOULD BE DOING CERTAIN THINGS WHEN YOU SHOULD THROUTLE BACK WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO KICK UP YOUR ADRENAL IN A BIT IF YOUR SUFFERING FROM LOW ENERGY BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST KIND OF FEELING DOWN AND A LITTLE BIT A UNDER ACTIVATED WILL THEN THE PRACTICES OF ICE BATHS AND INTENDE BREATHING ET CETERA COULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL SO MIGH FASTING BUT IF YOUR FEELING EXHAUSTED AND BURNT OUT SO DRAINEDAN STREST WILL THEN FASTING OR DOING A LOT OF COLD EXPOSURE OR DOING A LOT OF INTENSE EXERCISE IS DRIVING YOU FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO CHRONIC TRESS SO BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A SALIVA TEST OR A BLOOD TEST AR GOD FORBIDDEN YOUR AX TEST TO MEASURE YOUR CORTIS ALL AS WERE ENGAGING IN THIS DISCUSSION TOGETHER YOU HAFE TO GAUGE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER NOT YOU ARE IN A STATE OF UNDERACTIVATED AND NEED MORE EPINEFFORTING CORTIS ALL OR WHETHER R NOT YOU ARE OVER ACTIVATED IN TERMS OF CORTIS ALL AN EPANEPRAN AND YOU NEED WAYS TO BUFFER THOSE ASHUAGONA A MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A WARM MELLOBATH NOT AN ICE BATH SO ONE HAS TO LEARN HOW TO REGULATE THESE HORMONES WITH BEHAVIOR WITH NUTRITCION PERHAPS WIT SUPPLEMENTATION AND THEN OF COURSE THERE ARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND I I ALWAYS LEAVE THESE TO THE END BECAUSE A I'M NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR I'M NOT PRESCRIBING ANYTHING I'M A PROFESSOR ON PROFESSING A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DECIDE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT TO DO WITH OR NOT BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT CAN INCREASE CORTIS ALL OR DECREASE CORTISALL IN CASES LIKE CUSHING CENDRUM WHICH IF YOU HAVE THAT DIGNOSE YOU SHOULD TALK TO A PHYSICIAN YOU SHOULD TALK IDEALLY TO A AND A CHRONOLOGIST BUT TO A PHYSICIAN OF SOME SORT BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICION THERE ARE DRUGS THAT CAN BE USED TO TREAT INJURY LIKE CORTICA STERONES THAT YOU CAN INJECT TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION INJURY BUT THEY ARE CORTIS ALL SO THEY'RE GEN ABISE YOU TOWARDS MORE STRESS IN OTHER DOMAINS REMEMBER COURTS ALL CONCRUSS THE CROSS THE BLOOD BRAINBERRERS WHO CAN BE MORE PRONE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS I ALSO WANT O MENTION AGAIN THAT I THINK THERE'S GREAT BENEFIT TO HAVING A PRACTICE THAT PERHAPS YOU DO EVERY OTHER DAY BUT IF YOU CAN'T MAY BE EVERY THORDAY OR EVERY OTHER DAY OF DELIBERATELY INCREASING YOUR ADRENALINE IN YOUR BODY WHILE LEARNING TO STAY CALM IN THE MIND SO THAT YOU LEARN TO SEPARATE THE BRAIN BODY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT HOW BENEFICIAL IT IS TO UNIFY THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT WE'RE ALL OUT OF TOUCH WITH OUR BRAIN AND BODIES I I I PARTICULARLY DISLIKE CLAIMS LIKE THAT OR STATEMENTS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE'S GREAT POWER AS WE LEARN TODAY IN HAVING YOUR BODY ACTIVATED BY SOME SORT OF STIMULUS COLD WATER OR EVEN PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS BUT LEARNING TO STAY CALM IN YOUR MIND I SHOULDJUST REMIND YOU THAT MOST OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON YOUR LIFE AND ON THE LIVES OF OTHERS ARE DUE TO PEOPLE PERHAPS YOU I HOPE NOT BEING UNABLE TO REGULATE THEIR MIND WHEN THEY HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF DRENALINE IN THEIR BODY EITHER BECAUSE THEY READ SOMETHING UN ATTEXT OR A COMMENT SECTION COURSE THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME BUT IT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU OF COURSE IT HAPPENS TO ME BUT THE IDEAS TO STAY CALM IN YOUR MIND SO THAT THEN YOU CAN REGULATE YOUR ACTION RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE THESE PRACTICES THAT ONE CAN DEVELOP OVER TIME THAT ARE REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND ZERO COST RIGHT YOU COULD FIND ANY NUMBER OF WAYS TO INCREASE YOURE ADRENALIN AND STAY CALM AND WE TEND TO FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE EXERCISE AS THE WAY THAT WE GET OUR ENERGY UP BUT TO DAY AGAIN I'M TALKING ABOUT DELIBERATELY INCREASING A DRENALINE WHILST STING CALM MENTALLY BECAUSE THAT HAS GREAT UTILITY WHEN THE ADRENALINE HITS THROUGH UNWANTED EVENTS THROUGH THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T SEEK OUT SO THE EBILITY TO REGULATE A DRENALING CORTSALL IS ABOUT IN DUCSING THEM DELIBERATELY WHEN YOU WANT TO PUSH BACK ON INFECTION POTENTIAL INFACTION FROM BACK TURIOR VIRUSES IT'S ABOUT PULLIN NG BACK ON A DRENNALINE IN CORTISALL MAYBE THROUGH THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTATION BUT CERTAINLY THROUGH PROPER USE OF LIGHT AND SLEEP AND MENTAL TOOLS THT WE TALKED ABOUT AS WELL WHEN THEY ARE CHRONICALLY ELEVATED IT'S ABOUT TRAINING YOUR SYSTEM NOT JUST TO BE UNIFIED TOT BRAIN AND BODY WHICH SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOUR STRESS AND THEN THAT'S TERRIBLE IT'S REALLY ABOUT HAVING A DELIBERATE DISSOCIATION BETWEEN THE ADRENALIN RESPONSE FROM THE ADRINALS IN THE DRENALINE RESPONSE FROM THE BRAINCETEM SO ONCE AGAIN WE'VE COVERED A TON OF MATERIAL I HOPE RIGHT NOW YOUR THINKING OQE AM I IN A STATE OF CHRONIC STRESS AND I UNDERACTIVATED ORT COULD I AFFORD TO INCREASE MY LEVELS OF A DRENNALING CORTISALL TO IMPROVE MY RELATIONSHIP TO MY IMUNE SYSTEM AND TO ENERGY NURL ENERGY IF YOU LIKE THE INFORMATION AND THAT YOU HEARD TODAY AND YOU WANT TO REMEMBER IT WELL THEN AT THE AND OF THIS EPISODE PERHAPS YOU GO DO SOMETHING TO INCREASE YOUR LEVEL OF ADRENNALINE AND NOW YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE BECAUSE IT WILL HELP YOU RETAIN THE INFORMATION OR YOU COULD APPLY THAT TO ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU LEARN OR EXPERIENCE OF COURSE AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH COURT IS ALL AND ADRENNALANE ARE NOT GOOD OR BAD THAT STRESSES IN GOOD OR BAD BUT SHORT TERM STRESS IS HEALTHY ALERTNESS AND ENERGY IS HEALTHY EVEN IF IT PUTS YOU AT THE EDGE OF AGITATION THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THESE HORMONES BETTER AND I HOPE THAT IF YOUR IN A STATE OF CHRONIC STRESS THAT YOU'LL DO THINGS TO START TAMPING DOWN SOME OF THAT STRESS AND THAT YOU REALIZE THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN YOUR HORMONE SYSTEM ARE LINKED BUT THERE LINKED IN WAYS THAT YOU CON CONTROL THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SLAVES TO OUR HORMONES AND CERTAINLY NOT THE HORMONES THAT CAUSE US STRESS WE CAN LEARN TO CONTROL THOSE BOTH TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR BODY

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN TAONCA  T AS SCIENCE  SCIENCE BACE TOCE R LI  I MAND YOUR HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDISEM FOR TO DAY'S PODCAST WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PARTS LIST OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NOW THAT MIGHT SOUND BORING BUT THESE ARE THE BITS AN PIECES THAT TOGETHER MAKE UP EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE FROM WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT TO WHAT YOU FEEL WHAT YOU IMAGIN AND WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISH FROM THE DAY YOU'RE BORN UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE THAT PARTS LIST IS REALLY INCREDIBLE BECAUSE IT HAS A HISTORY ASSOCIATED WITH IT THAT REALLY PROVIDES A WINDOW INTO ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE ENGINEERING WARFARE RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY SO I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU THE PARTS LITS THAT MAKES UP WHO YOU ARE THROUGH THE LENDS OF SOME OF THOSE OTHER ASPECTS OF LIFE AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE HISTORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BY THE END OF THIS PODCAST I PROMISE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE ABOUT HOW YOU WORK AND HOW TO APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE S CME MOE LITTR BUT TO STORY TERS CU ME ALLOT O DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THESE PARTICULAR DISCOVERIES THEYE'LL BE A LITTLE BIT OF TECHNICAL LANGUAGE THERE'S NO WAY TO AVOID THAT BUT AT THE END YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IN HAND WHAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF AN ENTIRE SUMMESTER OF LEARNING ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HOW YOU WORK SO A FEW IMPORTANT POINTS BEFORE WE GET STARTED I AM NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR THAT MEANS I DON'T PROSCRIBE ANYTHING I'M A PRPROFESSOR SO SOMETIMES I'LL PROFESS THINGS IN FACT I PROFESS A LOT OF THINGS WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME BASIC FUNCTIONING O THE NERVOUS SYSTEM PARTS AND ET CETERA BUT WERE ALSO GO AND TALK ABOUT HOW TO APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT SAID YOUR HEALTH CARE YOURE WELL BEING AS YOUR RESPONSIBILITIE SO ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT TOOLS PLEASE FILTER IT THROUGH THAT RESPONSIBILITY TALK TO HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL THIF YOU GAN TO EXPLORE ANY NEW TOOLS OR PRACTICES AND ON BE SMART AND IN YOUR PURSUIT OF THESE NEW TOOLS A'LSO ONE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST AND THE OTHER THINGS I DO ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE MY PERSONAL GOAL OF BRINGING S ZEURO COST OC CONSUMER INFORMATION TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IT IS SEPARATE FROM MY ROLE AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY IN THAT SPIRIT I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LET IT GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VIT IM IN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THEREASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIAM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WIH YOUR BRAIN TO RA GULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBILCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIO IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LLGIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT IN VITEM EN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OF TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KE ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION END THAT YOURE GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN ND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK CAM SLASH HUBERMAN SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE REASON I SAY YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NOT YOUR BRAIN IS BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS ACTALLY JUST ONE PIECE OF THIS LARGER MORE IMPORTANT THING FRANKLY THAT WE CALL THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE NERVOUS SYSTEM INCLUDES YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR SPINAL CORD BUT ALSO ALL THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR SPINAL CORD AND THE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY IT ALSO INCLUDES VERY IMPORTANTLY ALL THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUR ORGANS BACK TO YOUR SPINAL CORD AN BRAIN SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU FUNCTION AT EVERY LEVEL FROM THE MOMENT YOU'RE BORN UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE EVERYTHING YOU THINK AND REMEMBER AND FEEL AND IMAGINE IS THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THIS CONTINUOUS LOOP OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BRAIN SPINAL CORD AND BODY AND BODY SPINAL CORD AN BRAIN IN FACT WE REALLY CAN EVEN SEPARATE THEM ITS ONE CONTINUOUS LOOP YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF OF SOMETHING CALLD THE MOBIOUS STRIP AMOBIAS STRIP IS ALMOST LIKE ONE OF THESE IMPOSSIBLE FIGURES THAT NO MATTER WHICH ANGLE YOU LOOK AT IT FROM YOU CAN'T TELL WHERE T STARTS AND WHERE IT ENDS AND THAT'S REALLY HOW YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS BUILT THAT'S THE STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FOR INSTANCE DEPLOY A MUNE CELLS TO RELEASE CELLS THAT WILL GO KILL INFECTION WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF INFECTION MOST PEOPLE JUST THINK ABOUT THAT AS A FUNCTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BUT ACTUALLY IT'S YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT TELLS ORGANS LIKE YOUR SPLEEN TO RELEASE KILLER CELLS THAT GO AND HUNT DOWN THOSE BACTORIAL AND VIRAL INVADERS AND EN GOBBLE THEM UP IF YOU HAVE A STOMACH APE FOR INSTANCE SURE YOU FEEL THAT IN YOUR STOMACH BUT IT'S REALY YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT'S CAUSING THE STOMACH ACHE THE ACHE ASPECT OF IT IS A NERVOUS SYSTEM FEATURE SO WHEN WE WANT O TALK ABOUT EXPERIENCE WOR WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO CHANGE THE CELL IN ANY WAY WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FIRST IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM GOVERNS ALL OTHER BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF THE BODY AND IT'S ALSO INFLUENCE BY THOSE OTHER BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS SO IF WE'RE TALKING BOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WE NEED TO GET A LITTLE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN IT'S NOT JUST THIS BIG LOOP OF WIRES IN FACT THERE'S A INTERESTING STORY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AT THE TURN OF THES OF EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS TO NINETEEN HUNDREDS IT ACTUALLY WAS BELIEVED THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS JUST ONE GIANT CELL BUT TWO GUYS A NAMES AREN'T SUPERIMPORTANT BUT O INFAIRNESS TO THEIR IMPORTANT DISCOVERY REMONI COHAL A SPANIARD CHOMELOGULOGY AND ITALIAN GUY FIGURED OUT HOW TO LABEL OR STAIN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT REVEALED OMAGODNISTS WERE ACTUALLY MADE UP OF TRILIANS OF THESE LITTLE CELLS NERVE CELLS THAT ARE CALLED NORONS THAT'S WHAT A NERON IS IS JUST A NERVE CELL THEY ALSO SAW THAT THOSE NERVE CELLS WEREN'T TOUCHING ONE ANOTHER THERE ACTUALLY SEPARATED BY LITTLE GAPS AND THOSE LITTLE GAPS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE THEY'RE CALLED SYNAPSES THE SYNAPSES ARE WHERE THE CHEMICALS FROM ONDER ON ARE KIND OF SPIT OUT ARE VOMITED INTO AND THEN THE THE NEXT NERVE CELL DETECTS THOSE CHEMICALS AND THEN PASSES ELECTRICITY DOWN ITS LENGTH TO THE NEXT NERVE CELL AND SO FORTH SO REALLY THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT YOUR BODY AND YOUR THOUGHTS IN YOUR MIND IS THAT YOU ARE A FLOW OF ELECTRICITY E THERE'S NOTHING MYSTICAL ABOUT THIS YOUARE A FLOW OF ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT NERVE CELLS AND DEPENDING ON WHICH NERVE CELLS ARE ACTIVE YOU MIGHT BE LIFTING YOUR ARM OR LOWERING YOUR ARM YOU MIGHT BE SEEING SOMETHING AND PERCEIVING THAT ITS READ OR YOU MIGHT BE SEENG SOMETHING IN PERCEIVING THAT ITS GREEN ALL DEPENDING ON WHICH NERVE CELLS ARE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE AT A GIVEN MOMENT UT THE EXAMPLE OF PERCEIVING RED OR PERCEIVING GREEN AS A PARTICULARLY GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE SO OFTEN ARE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD MAKES IT SEEM AS IF THESE OUT THESE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUTSIDE US ARE ACTUALLY HAPPENING INSIDE US BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS JUST ELECTRICITY IT'S JUST LIKE A A MORSE CODE OF SOME SORT ERE THE SYLLABLS OR AND WORDS AND CONSONENCE AND VOWELS OF LANGUAGE THA JUST DEPENDS ON HOW THEIR ASSEMBLED WHAT ORDER AND SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE THE ISSUE OF HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS IS THAT OUR EXPERIENCES OUR MEMORIES EVERYTHING IS SORT LIKE THE KEYS ON A PIANO BEING PLAYED IN A PARTICULAR ORDER RIGHT IF I PLAY THE KEYS ON A PIANO IN A PARTICULAR ORDER AND WITH A PARTICULAR INTENSITY THAT'S A GIVEN SONG WE COULD MAKE THAT ANALOGOUS TO A GIVEN EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT REALLY THAT THE KEY YOU KNOW A SHARP OR E FLAT IS A THE SNG IT'S JUST ONE COMPONENT OF THE SONG SO WHEN YOU HEAR THAT YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE A THERE'S A BRAIN AREA CALLED THE HIPPOCAMPUS WHICH THERE IS THAT'S INVOLVED IN MEMORY WELL IT IT'S INVOLVED IN MEMORY BUT IT'S NOT THAT MEMORIES ARE STORED THERE AS A YOU KNO SENTENCES THERE STORED THERE AS PATTERNS OF ELECTRICITY IN NURONS THAT WHEN REPEATED GIVE YOU THE SENSE THAT YOUERE EXPERIENCING THE THING AGAIN IN FACT DE JAVOU THE SENSE THAT WHAT YOURE EXPERIENCING IS SO FAMILIAR AND LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCE PREVIOUSLY IS MERELY THAT THE NURONS THAT WERE ACTIVE IN ONE CIRCUMSTANCE ARE NOW BECOMING ACTIVE IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE AGAIN AND SO IT'S REALLY JUST LIKE HEARING THE SAME SONG MAY BE A NOT PLAYED ON A PIANO BUT NEXT TIME ON THE CLASSICAL GUITAR THERE'S SOMETHING SIMILAR ABOUT THAT SONG EVENTHOUGH IT'S BEING PLAYED ON TWO DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE PARTS OF THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT IT INCLUDE SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE BRAIN AND THAT THERE ARE THESE THINGS NURONS AN SINAPSES BUT REALLY THAT IT'S THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF THESE NURONS THAT DICTATES ARE EXPERIENCE SO IF THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WERE WHEN THESE NURONS WERE DISCOVERED CERTAINLY A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN AND IN THAT TIME BETWEEN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS AND NOW THERE SOME IMPORTANT EVENTS THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN HISTORY THAT GIVE US INSIGHT OR GAVE US INSIGHT INTO HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS ONE OF THE MORE SURPRISING ONES WAS ACTUALLY WARFARE SO AS O MOST EVERYBODY KNOWS IN WARFARE PEOPLE GET SHOT AND PEOPLE OFTEN DIE BUT MANY PEOPLE GET SHOT AND THEY DON'T DIE AND IN WORLD WERE ONE THERE WERE SOME CHANGES IN ARTILLERY IN BULLETS THAT MADE FOR SITUATION WHERE BULLETS WOULD ENTER THE BODY AN BRAIN AT VERY DISCREET LOCATIONS AND WOULD GO OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BODY OR BRAIN AND ALSO MAKE A VERY SMALL HOLE AT THAT EXIT LOCATION AND IN DOING SO PRODUCED A LOT OF NATURALLY OCCURRING LESIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NOW YOU SAY O K WHOL HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO NERO SCIENCE WELL UNLIKE PREVIOUS YEARS WHERE A LOT OF THE ARTILLERY WOULD CREATE THESE BIG SORT OF A HOLES AS AS THE BULLETS WOULD WOULD BLOW OUT OF THE BRAIN OR BODY I NOW THE IS RATHER GRUESOME WHEN THE HOLES WERE VERY DISCREET THEY ENTERED AT ONE POINT AND LEFT AT ANOTHER POINT THEY WOULD TAKE OUT OR DESTROY VERY D SCREET BITS OF NERL TISSUE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SO PEOPLE WERE COMING BACK FROM WAR WITH HOLES IN THEIR BRAIN AND IN OTHER PARTS OF THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WERE LIMITED TO VERY SPECIFIC LOCATIONS IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE WAS SOME ADVANCEMENT IN THE CLEANING OF WOUNDS THAT HAPPENED SO MANY MORE PEOPLE WERE WERE SURVIVING WHAT THIS MEANT WAS THAT NEUROLOGISTS NOW HAD A COLLECTION OF PATIENTS THAT WOULD COME BACK AND THEY'D HAVE HOLES IN VERY SPECIFIC LOCATIONS OF THEIR BRAIN AND THEY'D SAY THINGS LIKE WELL I CAN RECOGNIZE FACES BUT I CAN'T RECOGNIZE WHO THOSE FACES BELONG TO I KNOW IT'S A FACE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO BELONGS TO AND AFTER THAT PERSON EVENTUALLY DIED THE NEUROLOGIST WOULD FIGURE OUT AH I'VE HAD TEN PATIENTS THAT ALL TOLD ME THAT THEY COULDN'T RECOGNIZE FACES AND THEY ALL HAD THESE BULLET HOLES THAT WENT THROUGH A PARTICULAR REGION OF THE BRAIN AND THAT'S HOW WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT HOW PARTICULAR BRAIN REGIONS LIKE THE HIPPOCAMPUS WORK IN FACT SOME OF THE MWERE A AMAZING EXAMPLES OF THIS WHERE WERE PEOPLE WOULD COME BACK AND THEY O FOR INSTANCE WOULD SPEAK IN COMPLETE GIBBERISH THEY'D WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY THEY COULD SPEAK NORMALLY AND EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SPEAKINING COMPLETE GIBBERISH THEY COULD UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE PERFECTLY THAT'S HOW WE KNOW THAT SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ARE ACTUALLY CONTROL BY SEPARATE PORTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THERE MANY EXAMPLES LIKE THAT PEOPLE THAT A COULDN'T A RECOGNIZE THE FACES OF FMOUS PEOPLE OR AM AND THAT ACTION BRINGS US TO AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE IN MODERN TIMES MANY MANY YEARS LATER IN THE A EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THERE WAS ASHYA PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL NATURE EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOWING THAT IN A HUMAN BEING A PERFECTLY HEALTHY HUMAN BEING THERE WAS A NURON THAT WOULD BECOME ACTIVE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE ONLY WHEN THE PERSON VIEWED THE PICTURE OF GENIPHER ANISTON THE ACTRESS SO LITERALLY A NURON THAT REPRESENTED GENIPHR ANISTON SO COLL GENIER ANISTON CELLS NOR SCIENTIS KNOW ABY THESE GENIPHER ANISTON CELLS IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE GENIPER ANISTON'S FACE YOU HAVE GENIPHER ANISTON NURONS AND PRESUME LE ALSO OF NURONS THAT CAN RECOGNTIZE THE FACES OF OTHER FAMOUS AND NONFAMOUS PEOPLE SO THAT INDICATES THAT OUR BRAIN IS REALLY A MAP OF OUR EXPERIENCE AR WE COME INTO THE WORLD AND OUR BRAIN HAS A KIND OF BIAS TOWARDS LEARNING PARTICULAR KINDS OF THINGS IT'S READY TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND LEARN THAT INFORMATION BUT THE BRAIN IS REALLY A MAP OF EXPERIENCE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT EXPERIENCE REALLY IS WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR YOUR BRAIN TO WORK WELL I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM REALLY DOES FIVE THINGS MAYBE SIX THE FIRST ONE IS SENSATION SO THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FOR ANY AND ALL OF YOU THAT WANT TO CHANGE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM OR TO APPLY TOOLS TO MAKE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WORK BETTER SENSATION IS A NON NEGOTIABLE ELEMENT OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR EYE THAT PERCEIVE CERTAIN COLORS OF LIGHT AND CERTAIN DIRECTIONS OF MOVEMENT YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR SKIN THAT PERCEIVE PARTICULAR KINDS OF T CH LIKE LIGHT TOUCH OR FIRM TOUCH OR PAINFUL TOUCH YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR EARS THAT PERCEIVE CERTAIN SOUNDS YOURE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE IS SO FILTERED BY THESE WHAT WE CALL SENSORY RECEPTORS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW AT THE NAMIS SO THIS ALWAYS RAISES AN INTERESTIN QUESTION PEOPLE ASK WILL IS THERE MUCH MORE OUT THERE IS THAT A LOT MORE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD THAT I'M NOT EXPERIENCING OR THAT HUMANS AREN'T EXPERIENCING AND THE ANSWER COURSES YES THEIRE MANY SPECIES ON THIS PLANET THAT ARE PERCEIVING THINGS THAT WE WILL NEVER PERCEIVE UNLESS WE APPLY TECHNOLOGY H BEST EXAMPLE I COULD THINK OF ON OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE INFPER RED VISION THERE ARE SNAKES OUT THERE PIT VIPERS AND SO FORTH THAT CANSENSE HEAT OMISSIONS FROM OTHER ANIMALS THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SEE THEIR SHAPE THEY SENSE THEIR HEAT SHAPE AND THEIR HEAT OMISSIONS HUMANS CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS OF COURSE THEY PUT ON INFEREGOGGLES OR SOMETHING THT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DETECT THOSE HEAT OMISSIONS THERE ARE TURTLES AND CERTAIN SPECIES OF BIRDS THAT MIGRATE LONG DISTANCES THAT CAN DETECT MAGNETIC FIELDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NURONS AGAIN IT'S THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THIS SO THEY HAVE NURONS IN THEIR NOSE AND IN THEIR HEAD THAT ALLOW THEM TO MIGRATE ALONG MAGNETIC FIELDS IN ORDER TO AS AMAZING AS THE SOUNS GO FROM ONE PARTICULAR LOCATION IN THE OCEON THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY TO ALL AGGREGATE ON ONE PARTICULAR BEACH AT A PARTICULAR TIME OF YEAR SO THAT THEY CAN MATE LAY EGGS AND THEN WANDER BACK OFF INTO THE SEE TO DIE AND THN THEIR YOUNG WILL EVENTUALLY HATCH THOSE LITLE CUTALE TURTLES WILL SHUFFLE TO THE OCEAN SWIM OFF AND GO TO THE EXACT SAME THING THEY DON'T DO MIGRATE THAT DISTANCE BY VISION THEY DON'T DO IT BY SMELL THEY DO IT BY SENSING MAGNETIC FIELDS AND MANY OTHER SPECIES DO THESE INCREDIBLE THINGS WE DON'T HUMANS ARE NOT MAGNETIC SENSING ORGANISMS WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE RECEPTERS THAT SENSE MAGNETIC FIELDS THERE'RE SOME DATA THAT MAY BE SOME HUMANS CONSENSE MAGNETIC FIELDS BUT YOU SHOULDBE VERY SCEPTICAL OF ANYONE THAT'S A CONVINCE THAT THEY CAN DO THAT WITH ANY DEGREE OF ROBUSTNESS OR ACCURACY BECAUSE EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT CAN DO THIS AREN'T NECESSARILY AWARE THAT THEY CAN MAYBE A TOPIC FOR A FUTURE PODCAST SO WE HAVE SENSATION THEN WE HAVE PERCEPTION PERCEPTION IS OUR ABILITY TO TAKE WHAT WERE SENSING AND FOCUS ON IT AND MAKE SENSE OF IT TO EXPLORE IT TO REMEMBER IT SO REALLY PERCEPTIONS ARE JUST WHICHEVER SENSATIONS WE HAPPEN TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO AT ANY MOMENT AND YOU CAN DO THIS RIGHT NOW YOU CAN EXPERIENCE PERCEPTION IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND SENSATION VERY EASILY IF FOR INSTANCE I TELL YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE CONTACT OF YOUR FEET THE BOTTOMS OF YOUR FEET WITH WHATEVER SURFACE THEY HAPPEN BE IN CONTACT WITH MAYBE ITS SHOES MAYBE IT'S THE FLOOR YOUR FEET ARE UP MAYBE IT'S AIR THE MOMENT YOU PLACE YOUR WHAT WE CALL THE SPOTLIGHT OF ATTENTION OR THE SPOTLIGHT OF PERCEPTION ON YOUR FEET YOU ARE NOW PERCEIVING WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE WHAT WAS BEING SENSED THERE THE SENSATION WAS HAPPENING ALL ALONG HOWEVER SO WHILE SENSATION IS NOT NEGOTIABLE YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR RECEPTORS UNLESS YOU A ADOPT SOME NEU TECHNOLOGY PERCEPTION IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF YOUR ATTENTION AND THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT ATTENTION IS IT'S LIKE A SPOTLIGHT EXCEPT IT'S NOT ONE SPOTLIGHT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TOO ATTENTIONAL SPOTLIGHTS ANY ONE THAT TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T MULTI TASK TELL THEM THE WRONG AND IF THEY DISAGREE WITH YOU TELL THEM TO CONTACT ME BECAUSE IN OLD WORLD PRIMATES OF WHICH HUMANS ARE WE ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT'S CALLED COVERT ATTENTION WE CAN PLACE A SPOTLIGHT OF ATTENTION ON SOMETHING FOR INSTANCE SMETHING WE'RE READING OR LOOKING AT OR SOME ONE THAT WERE LISTENING TO AND WE CAN PLACE A SECOND SPOTLIGHT OF ATTENTION ON SOMETHING WE'RE EATING AND HOW IT TASTES OR OUR CHILD RUNNING AROUND IN THE ROOM OR MY DOG YOU CAN SPLIT YOUR ATTENTION INTO TO LOCATIONS BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO BRING YOUR ATTENTION THAT IS YOUR PERCEPTION TO ONE PARTICULAR LOCATION YOU CAN DILATE YOUR ATTENTION KIND LIKE MAKING A SPOTLIGHT MORE DIFFUSE OR YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE CONCENTRATED THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU'REGOING TO THINK ABOUT TOOLS TO IMPROVE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WHETHEROR NOT THAT TOOL IS IN THE FORM OF A CHEMICAL THAT YOU DECIDE TO TAKE MAY BE A SUPPLEMENT TO INCREASE SOME CHEMICAL IN YOUR BRAIN IF THAT'S A YOUR CHOICE OR A BRAIN MACHINE DEVICE OR YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AND LEARN SOMETHING BETTER BY A ENGAGING IN SOME FOCUS OR MOTIVATED PURSUIT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME EACH DAY AT TENTION IS SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNDER YOURE CONTROL IN PARTICULAR WHEN YOU'RE RESTED AND WE'LL GET BACK TO THIS BUT WHEN YOU ARE RESTED AND WE'LL DEFINE REST VERY CLEARLY YOU ARE ABLE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION IN VERY DELIBERATE WAYS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS SORTER LIKE A TOO WAY STREET AND THAT TOO WAY STREET IS A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ASPECTS OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ARE REFLECIVE AND THE ASPECTS OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ARE DELIBERATE SO WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE REFLECTIVE YOU GO THROUGH LIFE YOUR WALKING IF YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO WALK YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR WALKING YOU JUST WALK AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WANTS TO PASS OFF AS MUCH AS IT CAN TO REFLECTSIVE ACTION THAT'S CALLED BOTTOM UP PROCESSING IT RELY JOUST MEANS THAT INFORMATION IS FLOWING IN THROUGH YOUR SENSIS REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU'RE PERCEIVING THAT INFORMATION IS FLOWING UP AND ITS DIRECTING YOUR ACTIVITY BUT AT ANY MOMENT FOR INSTANCE LET'S SAY A CAR SCREECHES IN FRONT OF YOU AROUND THE CORNER AND YOU SUDDENLY PAS YOU ARE NOW MOVING INTO DELIBERATE ACTION YOU WOULD START LOOKING AROUND IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN BE REFLECIVE IN ITS ACTION OR IT CAN BE DELIBERATE IT IF REFLECS IVE ACTIONTENDS TO BE WHAT WE CALL BOTTOM UP DELIBERATE ACTION AND DELIBERATE PERCEPTIONS AND DELIBERATE THOUGHTS ARE TOPPED DOWN THEY REQUIRE SOME EFFORT AND SOME FOCUS BUT THAT'S THE POINT YOU CAN DECIDE TO FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION AND ENERGY ON ANYTHING YOU WANT YOU CAN DECIDE TO FOCUS YOUR BEHAVIOR IN ANY WAY YOU WANT BUT IT WILL ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IT REQUIRE SOME EFFORT AND SOME STRAIN WHEREAS WHEN YOUR REFLECTIVE MOD JUST WALKING AND TALKING AND EATING AND DOING YOUR THING IT'S CAN A FEEL VERY EASY AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BASICALLY WIRED UP TO BE ABLE TO DO MOST THINGS EASILY WITHOUT MUCH METABOLIC TO MAN WITHOUT CONSUMING MUCH ENERGY BUT THE MOMENT YOU TRY AND DO SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC IT'S GOING TO YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL A SORT OF MENTAL FRICTION IT'S CON TO BE CHALLENGING SO WE'VE GOT SENSATIONS PERCEPTIONS AND THEN WE'VE GOT THINGS THAT WE CALL FEELINGS SLASH EMOTIONS AND THESE GET LOCOMPLICATED BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF US I WOULD HOPE ALL OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH THINGS LIKE HAPPINESS AND SADNESS OR BORDUM OR FRUSTRATION SCIENTISTS ARGUE LIKE CRAZY NERO SCIENTOS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS FOR THAT MATTER ARE YOU LIKE CRAZY ABOUT WHAT THESE ARE AND HOW THEY WORK CERTAINLY EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS ARE THE PRODUCT OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THEY INVOLVE THE ACTIVITY OF NURANTS BUT AS I MENTION EARLIER NURONS ARE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE BUT THEY ALSO RELEASE CHEMICALS AND THERE'S A CERTAIN CATEGORY OF CHEMICALS THAT HAS A VERY PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON OUR EMOTIONAL STATES THEY ARE CALLED NEROMODULATORS AND THOSE NEROMODULATORS HAVE NAMES THAT PROBABLY YOU'VE HEARD OF BEFORE THINGS LIKE DOPOMINE AND SERATONAN AND A SETOCOLINE APINEFERAN NEUROMODULATORS ARE REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY BUY US WHICH NURONS ARE LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE AND WHICH ONES ARE LIKELY TO BE INACTIVE A SIMPLE WAY TO THINK ABOUT NURMODULATORS IS THEY ARE SORT OF LIKE PLAYLESS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ON ON ANY KIND OF DEVICE WHERE YOU CAN PLAY PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF MUSIC SO FOR INSTANCE DOPOMINE WHICH IS OFTEN DISCUSSED AS THE MOLECULE OF REWARD OR JOY ITIS INVOLVED IN REWARD AND IT DOES TEND TO CREATE A SORT OF UPBEAT MOOD IN WHEN RELEASED IN APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS IN THE BRAIN BUT THE REASON IT DOES THAT IS BECAUSE IT MAKE CERTAIN NURONS AND NERNEURAL CIRCUITS AS WE CALL THEM MORE ACTIVE AND OTHERS LESS ACTIVE OCHASO CERATONAN FOR INSTANCE IS A MOLECULE THAT WHEN RELEASED TENDS TO MAKE US FEEL REALLY GOOD WITH WHAT WE HAVE AUR SORT OF INTERNAL LANDSCAPE AND THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WHERE AS DOPOMINE MORE THAN BEING A MOLECULE OF REWARD IS REALLY MORAMOLECULE OF MOTIVATION TOWARD THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE US AN THAT WE WANT TO PURSUE AND WE CAN LOOK AT HEALTHY CONDITIONS OR SITUATIONS LIKE BEING IN PURSUIT OF A GOAL WHERE EVERY TIME WE ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING IN ROOT TO THAT GOAL A LITLE BIT OF DOPOMINE IS RELEASED AND WE FEEL MORE MOTIVATION THAT HAPPENS OW WE CAN ALL SO LOOK AT THE EXTREME EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING LIKE MANIA WHERE SOMEBODY IS SO YO RELENTLESSLY IN PURSUIT OF EXTERNAL THINGS LIKE MONEY AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEIR SORT OF IN THIS DELUSIONAL STATE OF THINKING THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO PURSUE ALL THESE THINGS WHEN IN FACT THEY DON'T SO THESE NORMODULATORS CAN EXIST IN NORMAL LEVELS LOW LEVELS HIGH LEVELS AND THAT ACTUALLY GIVES US A WINDOW INTO A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF NORO SCIENCE HISTORY THAT ALL OF US ARE IMPACTED BY TO DAY WHICH IS THE DISCOVERY OF ANTI DEPRESSENS AND SO CALLED ANTIPSYCOTICS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTY SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES IT WAS DISCOVER THAT THERE ARE COMPOUNDS CHEMICALS THAT CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE SERATONAN THAT CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE DOPAMINE AND THAT LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOST OF WHAT WE CALL ANTIDEPRESSENS NOW THE TRICK HERE OR THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST OF THESE DRUGS ESPECIALLY IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIESE AND SIXTIES THEY WOULD REDUCE SERATONAN BUT THEY WOULD ALSO REDUCE DOPOMINE OR THEY WOULD INCREASE SERATONAN BUT THEY WOULD ALSO INCREASE SOME OTHER NOROMODULATOR OR CHEMICAL AND THAT'S BECAUSE ALL THESE CHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN THE BODY BUT THE NORMODULATORS IN PARTICULAR HAVE A LOT OF RESCEPTERS NOW THESE ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE RECEPTORS WERE TALK ABOUT EARLIER THE RECEPTORS ON TALKIN ABOUT NOW ARE SORT LIKE PARKING SPOTS WHERE DOPAMINE IS RELEASED AND IF IT ATTACHES TO A RECEPTOR SAY ON THE HEART IT MIGHT MAKE THE HEART BEAT FASTER BECAUSE THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND OF RECEPTERE ON THE HEART WHEREAS IF DOPAMINE IS RELEASED AND GOES AND ATTACHES TO MUSCLE IT MIGHT HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EFFECT ON MUSCLE AND IN FACT IT DOES SO DIFFERENT RECEPTORS ON DFFERENT ORGANS OF THE BODY ARE THE WAYS THAT THESE NOROMODULATORS CAN HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OR BIOLOGY THIS IS A MOST SALIENT IN THE EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE ANTIDEPRESSENTS THAT HAVE A SECUAL SIDE EFFECTS OR THAT BLUNT APPETITE OR THAT BLUNT MOTIVATION NN IF OU MANY OF THESE WHICH INCREASE SERATONAN CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE IT CAN ELEVATE THEIR MOOD IT CAN MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER BUT THEY ALSO AT IF THERE THE DOSES ARE TOO HIGH OR IF THAT PARTICULAR DRUG IS IN RIGHT FOR SOMEBODY THAT PERSON EXPERIENCES CHALLENGES WITH MOTIVATION OR APPETITE OR LEBIDO BECAUSE SERETONAN IS BINDING TO RECEPTORS IN THE AREAS THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL THOSE OTHER THINGS AS WELL SO WE TALKED ABOUT SENSATION WE TALKE ABOUT PERCEPTION WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FEELINGS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THESE NEOUROMODULATORS AND WE HAVE TO CONSIDER ALSO THAT FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS ARE CONTEXTUAL IN SOME CULTURES SHOWING A LOT OF JOY OR LOT OF SADNESS IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE IN OTHER CULTURES IT'S CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE IS A SADNESS CIRCUIT OR AREA OF THE BRAIN OR A HAPPINESS CIRCUIT OR AREA OF THE BRAIN HOWEVER IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT CERTAIN CHEMICALS AND CERTAIN BRAIN CIRCUITS TEND TO BE ACTIVE WHEN WE ARE IN MOTIVATED STATES TEND TO BE ACTIVE WHEN WE ARE N NON MOTIVATED LAZY STATES TEND TO BE ACTIVE WHEN WE ARE FOCUST AND TEND TO BE ACTIVE WHEN WE ARE NOT FOCUST I WONT TO EMPHASIZE ALSO THAT EMOTIONS ARE SOMETHING THAT WE GENERALLY FEEL ARE NOT UNDER OUR CONTROL WE FEEL LIKE THE KIND OF GUISER UP WITHIN US AND THEY JUST CON HAPPEN TO UTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE SOMEWHAT REFLECTIVE WE DON'T REALLY SET OUT WITH A DELIBERATE THOUGHT TO BE HAPPIER DELIBERATE THOUGHT TO BE SAD WE TEND TO EXPERIENCE THEM IN KIND OF A PASSIVE REFLECTIVE WAY AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT THING WHICH ARE THOUGHTS THOUGHTS ARE REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS THEYARE LIKE PERCEPTIONS EXCEPT THAT THEY DRAW ON NOT JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE PRESENT BUT ALSO THINGS WE REMEMBER FROM THE PAST AND THINGS THAT WE ANTICIPATE ABOUT THE FUTURE TH OTHER THING ABOUT THOUGHTS THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT THOUGHTS CAN BE BOTH REFLECTIVE THEY CAN JUST BE OCCURRING ALL THE TIME SORT A LIKE POP UP WINDOWS ON AN POORLY FILTERED WEB BROWSER OR THEY CAN BE DELIBERATE WE CAN DECIDE TO HAVE A THOUGHT INFACT RIGHT NOW YOU COULD DECIDE TO HAVE A THOUGHT JUST LIKE YOU WOULD  DECIDE TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT ON A PIECE OF PAPER YOU CUD DECIDE THAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO A POD CAST THAT YOU ARE IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION YOU NOT JUST PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU'RE DIRECTING YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T  UNDERSTAND OR AT LEAST APPRECIATE THAT THE THOUGHT PATTERNS AND THE NERL CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE THOUGHTS CAN ACTUALY BE CONTROLLED IN THIS DELIBERATE WAY AND THEN FINALLY THERE ARE ACTIONS ACTIONS ARE BEHAVIORS ARE PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT TO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL OUR BEHAVIORS ARE ACTUALLY THE ONLY THING THAT ARE GOING TO CREATE ANY FOSSIL RECORD OF OUR EXISTENCE YOU KNOW AFTER WE DIE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM DETERIORATES ARE SKELETON WILL REMAIN BUT IT'S YOU KNW IN THE MOMENT OF OF EXPERIENCING SOMETHING VERY JOYFUL OR SOMETHING VERY SAD IT CAN FEEL SO ALL INCOMPASSING THAT WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT HAS SOME MEANING BEYOND THAT MOMENT BUT ACTUALLY FOR HUMANS AND I THINK FOR ALL SPECIES THE SENSATIONS THE PERCEPTIONS AND THE THOUGHTS AND THE FEELINGS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR LIFE SPAN NONE OF THAT IS ACTUALLY CARRIED FORWARD EXCEPT THE ONES THAT WE TAKE AND WE CONVERT INTO ACTIONS SUCH AS WRITING ACTIONS SUCH AS WORDS ACTIONS SUCH AS ENGINEERING NEW THINGS AND SO THE FOSSIL RECORD OF OUR SPECIES AND OF EACH ONE OF US IS REALLY THROUGH ACTION AND THAT IN PART IS WHY SO MUCH OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS DEVOTED TO CONVERTING SENSATION PERCEPTION FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS INTO ACTIONS IN FACT THE GREAT NOR A SCIENTISTS ARE PHYSIOLOGIST SHARRINGTON ONE O NO ABOUT PRIZE FOR HIS WORK IN MAPPING SOME OF THE CIRCUITRY THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NERVOUSELVES THAT GIVE RISE TO MOVEMENT AND HE SAID MOVEMENT IS THE FINAL COMMON PATHW THE OTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT OR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM OUR BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD INCLUDE THESTUFF IN OUR SKULL BUT ALSO CONNECT SO HEAVILY TO THE BODY IS BECAUSE MOST EVERYTHING THAT WE EXPERIENCE INCLUDING OUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS WAS REALLY DESIGN TO EITHER IMPACT OUR BEHAVIOR OR NOT AND THE FACT THAT THOUGHTS ALLOW US TO REACH INTO THE PAST AND ANTICIPATE THE FUTURE AND NOT JUST EXPERIENCE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MOMENT GAVE RISE TO AN INCREDIBLE CAPACITY FOR US TO INGAGE IN BEHAVIORS THAT ARE NOT JUST FOR THE MOMENT THERE BASED OMETHINGS THAT WE KNOW FROM THE PAST AND THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE AND THIS ASPECT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM OF CREATING MOVEMENT OCCURS THROUGH SOME VERY SIMPLE PATHWAYS AN THE REFLECTIVE PATHWAY BASICALLY INCLUDES AREAS OF THE BRAINSTEM WE CALL CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS WHEN YOU WALK PROVIDED YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO WALK YOU ARE BASICALLY WALKING BECAUSE YOU HAVE THESE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATES GROUPS OF NURONS THAT GENERATE RIGHT FOOTLIGHT FOOT RIGHTFOOT LEFT FOOT KIND OF MOVEMENT HOWEVER WHEN YOU DECIDE TO MOVE IN A PARTICULAR DELIBERATE WAY THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION YOU START TO ENGAGE AREEAS OF YOUR BRAIN FOR TOP DOWN PROCESING WHERE YOUR FOREBRAIN WORKS FROM THE TOP DOWN TO CONTROL THOSE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR SO THAT MAY BE ITS RIGHT FOOT RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT RIGHT FOOT RIGHT FOOT LEFT FOOT IF MAY BE YOUR HEIGHTING ALONG SOME ROCKS OR SOMETHING IN YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF MOVEMENT SO MOVEMENT IS JUST LIKE THOUGHTS CAN BE EITHER REFLECTSIVE OR DELIBERATE AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DELIBERATE I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS IN THE DELIBERATE WAY BECAUSE IT GIVE GIVES RISE TO A VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WERE NO TALK ABOUT NEXT WHICH IS YOUR ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND WHAT I LIKE TO CENTER ON FOR A SECOND IS THIS NOTION OF WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO DO SOMETHING DELIBERATELY WELL WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING DELIBERATELY YOU PAY ATTENTION YOU ARE BRINGING YOUR PERCEPTION TO AN ANALYSIS OF THREE THINGS DURATION HOW LONG SOMETHING IS GOIN TO TAKE OR SHOULD BE DONE PATH WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING AN OUTCOME IF YOU DO SOMETHING FOR A GIVEN LENGTH OF TIME WHAT'S CAN A HAPPEN NOW WHE YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET OR YOUR EATING OR YOU JUST TALKING REFLECTIVELY YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS WHAT I CALL DEP O DURATION PATH OUTCOME TYPE OF DELIBERATE FUNCTION IN YOUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT THE MOMENT YOU DECIDE TO LEARN SOMETHING OR TO RESIST SPEAKING OR TO SPEAK UP WHEN YOU WOULD RATHER BE QUIET ANY TIME YOUR DELIBERATELY FORCING YOURSELF OVER A THRESHOLD YOUR ENGAGING THESE BRAIN CIRCUITS AND THESE NERVOUS SYSTEM CIRCUITS THAT SUDDENLY MAKE IT FEEL AS IF SOMETHING IS CHALLENGING SOMETHING HAS CHANGED WHAT'S CHANGED WHAT'S CHANGE IS THAT WHEN YOU ENGAGE IN THIS DURATION PATH AND OUTCOME TYPE OF ON THINKING OR BEHAVIOR OR WAY OF BEING YOU START TO RECRUIT THESE NEUROMODULATORS THAT ARE RELEASED FR N PARTICULARAREAS OF YOUR BRAIN AND ALSO IT TURNS OUT FROM YOUR BODY AND THEY START HEWING TO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT NOW ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT ABOUT WHAT I'M FEELING LET'S LET'S GIVE A AN EXAMPLE WHERE PERHAPS SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING THAT'S TRIGGERING TO YOU YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T RESPOND YOU FEEL LIKE I SHOULDN'T RESPONDI SHOULDN'T RESPONDISION'T RESPONDINGYOU ARE ACTIVELY SUPPRESSING YOUR BEHAVIOR THROUGH TOP DOWN PROCESSING YOUR FOREBRAIN IS ACTUALLY PREVENTING YOU FROM SAYING THE THING THAT YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T SAY OR THAT MAYBE YOU SHOULD WAIT TO SAY OR SAY IN A DIFFERENT FORM THIS FEELS LIKE AGITATION AND STRESS BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUPPRESSING A CIRCUIT WE ACTUALLY CAN SEE EXAMPLES OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS WELL A SOME OF THE EXAMPLES A COME FROM CHILDREN IF YOU LOOK AT YOUNG CHILDREN THEY DON'T HAVE THE FOREBRAIN CIRCUITRY TO ENGAGE IN THIS TOP DOWN PROCESSING UNTIL THEY REACH AGE NOW TWENTY TWO EVEN TWENTY FIVE BUT IN YOUNG CHILDREN YOU SEE THIS IIN A REALLY ROBUST WAY YOU'LL SEE THAT WILL BE ROCKING BACK AND FORTH AT S HARD FOR THEM TO SIT STILL BECAUSE THOSE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS ARE CONSTANTLY GOING IN THE BACKGROUND WHEREATS ADULTS CAN SIT STILL A KID SEES A PIECE OF CANDY THAT IT WANTSON WHICH JUST REACH OUT AND GRAB IT WHEREAS AN ADULT PROBABLY WOULD ASK IF THEY COULD HAVE A PIECE OR WAIT UNTIL THEY WERE OFFERED A PIECE IN MOST CASES PEOPLE THAT HAVE DAMAGE TO THE CERTAIN AIREAS OF THE FRONTO LOBES DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF RESTRICTION THOYGL ES BLURT THINGS OUT THEY'LL JUST SAY THINGS WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THIS IMPULSIVITY IS A LACK OF TOP DOWN CONTROL A LACK OF TOPDOWN PROCESSING THE OTHER THING THAT WILL TURN OFF THE FOREBRAIN AND MAKE IT HARDER TO TOPDOWN PROCESSING IS A COUPLE OF OF DRINKS CONTAINING ALCOHOL WILL THE THE REMOVAL OF INHIBITION IS ACTUALLY A REMOVAL OF NURL INIBITION OF NERVE SELL SUPPRESSING THE ACTIVITY OF TH OF OTHER NERVE CELLS AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE THAT HAVE DAMAGE TO THEIR FRONTO LOBES OR YOU LOOK AT PUPPIES OR YOU LOOK AT YOUNG CHILDREN EVERYTHING'S A STIMULUS EVERYTHING IS A POTENTIAL INTERACTION FOR THEM AND THEY HAVE A VERY HARD TIME RESTRICTING THEIR BEHAVIOR IN THEIR SPEECH SO A LOT OF THE MOTOR SYSTEM IS DESIGN TO JUST WORK IN A REFLECTIVE WAY AND THEN WHEN WE DECIDE WE WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING OR NOT DO SOMETHING WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN THIS TOP DOWN RESTRICTION AND IT FEELS LIKE AGITATION BECAUSE IT'S ACCOMPANIED BY THE RELEASE OF A NAUROMODULATOR CALLED NOR AP ANEFFERON WHICH IN THE BODY WE CALL A DRENALINE AND IT ACTUALLY MAKES US FEEL AGITATED SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW OR TO LEARN TO SUPPRESS YOUR RESPONSES OR BE MORE DELIBERATE IN CAREFUL IN YOUR RESPONSES THAT IS GOING TO FEEL CHALLENGING FOR A PARTICULAR REASON IT'S FEEL CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE CHEMICALS IN YOUR BODY THAT ARE RELEASED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THAT EFFORT ARE DESIGN TO MAKE YOU FEEL KIND OF AGITATED THAT LOW LEVEL TREMOR THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY'RE REALLY REALLY ANGRY IS ACTUALLY A CHEMICALLY INDUCED LOW LEVEL TREMOR AND IT'S THE WHAT I CALL LIMBIC FRICTION THERE'S AN ARRA OF YOUR BRAIN THAT'S INVOLVED IN OUR MORE P RIMITIVE REPLAX OF RESPONSES CALL THE LIMBIC SYSTEM AND THE FRONTAL QUOROTEX IS IN A FRICTION IT'S IN A TUGG O WAR WITH THAT SYSTEM ALL THE TIME UNLESS OF COURSE YOU HAVE DAMAGE TO THE FRONTAL LOB OR YOU'VE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK OR SOMETHINGIN WHICH CASE YOU TEND TOT SAY AND DO WHATEVER AND SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IF YOU WANT UNDERSTAND NERAL PLASTICITY YOU WAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO HAPE YOUR BEHAVIOR HOW TO SHAPE YOUR THINKING HOW TO CHANGE HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO PERFORM IN ANY CONTEXT THE MOST IMPORTAN THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT REQUIRES TOP DOWN PLASTICITY IT REQUIRES THIS FEELING OF AGITATION IN FACT I WOULD SAY THAT AGITATION AND STRAIN IS THE ENTRY POINT TO NERAL PLASTICITY SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT NERL PLASTICITY IS LET'S EXPLORE IT NOT AS THE WAY IT'S NORMALLY TALKED ABOUT IN A MODERN CULTURE AS A NERAL PLASTICITY PLASTICITY IS GREAT BUT WHAT EXACTLY DO PEOPLE MEAN PLASTICITY ITSELF IS JUST A PROCESS BY WHICH NERANTS CAN CHANGE THEIR CONNECTIONS IN THE WAY THEY WORK SO THAT YOU YOU CAN GO FROM THINGIS BEING VERY CHALLENGING AND DELIBERATE REQUIRING A LOT OF EFFORT AN STRAIN TO THEM BEING REFLEXIVE AND TYPICALLY WHEN WE HER ABOUT PLASTCITY WERE THING ABOUT POSITIVE OR WHAT I CALL ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY A LOT OF PLASTICITY CAN BE INDUCED FOR INSTANCE BY BRAIN DAMAGE BUT THAT'S GENERALLY NOT THE KIND OF PLASTICITY THAT WE WANT SO WHEN I SAY PLASTICITY UNLESS I SAY OTHERWISE I MEAN ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY AND IN PARTICULAR MOST OF TE NERAL PLASTICITY THAT PEOPLE WANT IS SELF DIRECTED PLASTICITY BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE TRUISM TO NERL PLASTICITY IT'S THAT FROM BIRTH UNTIL ABOUT AGE TWENTY FIVE THE BRAIN IS INCREDIBLY PLASTIC KIDS ARE LEARNING ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT THEY CAN LEARN IT PASSIVELY THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORK TOO HARD OR FOCUS TOO HARD ALL THOUGH FOCUS HELPS TO LEARN NEW THINGS ACQUIRE NEW LANGUAGES ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS BUT IF YOU'RE AN ADULT AND YOU WANT A CHANGE YOUR NERL CIRCUITRY AT THE LEVEL OF EMOTIONS OR BEHAVIOR OR THOUGHTS OR ANYTHING REALLY YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO ASK TOO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ONE WHAT PARTICULAR ASPECT OF MY NERVOUS SYSTEM IN MY TRYING TO CHANGE MEANING AM I TRYING TO CHANGE MY EMOTIONS OR MY PERCEPTIONS MY SENSATIONS AND WHICH ONES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ME TO CHANGE AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GO ABOUT THAT WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF A REGIMEN TO ENGAGE NERAL PLASTICITY AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT SECOND QUESTION IS GOVERNED BY HOW AWAKE OR HOW SLEEPY WE ARE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT NERL PLASTICITY IS THE ABILITY FOR THESE CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE AND WHAT' SO INCREDIBLE ABOUT THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR IS THAT WE CAN DIRECT OUR OWN NERL CHANGES WE CAN DESIDE THAT WE WANT IT CHANGE OUR BRAIN IN OTHER WORDS OUR BRAIN CAN CHANGE ITSELF AND OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN CHANGE ITSELF AND THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID FOR OTHER ORGANS OF THE BODY EVEN THOUGH OUR OTHER ORGANS OF THE BODY HAVE SOME ABILITY TO CHANGE THEY CAN'T DIRECT IT THEY CAN'T THINK CAN DECIDE OH YOU KNOW YOUR GOT DOESN'T SAY OH YOU KNOW I I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST SPICY FOODS BETTER SO IM GA REARRANGE THE CONNECTIONS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WHEREAS YOUR BRAIN CAN DECIDE THAT YOU WANT O LEARN A LANGUAGE OR YOU WANT TO BE LESS EMOTIONALLY REACTIVE OR MORE EMOTIONALLY ENGAGED AND YOU CAN UNDERGO A SERIES OF STEPS THAT WILL ALLOW YOUR BRAIN TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES SO THAT EVENTUALLY BECOMES REFLECTSIVE FOR YOU TO DO THAT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS THOUGHT THAT NERL PLASTICITY WAS THE UNIQUE GIFT OF YOUNG ANIMALS IN HUMANS THAT IT COULD ONLY OCCUR WHEN WERE YOUNG AND IN FACT THE YOUNG BRAIN IS INCREDIBLY PLASTIC CHILDREN CAN LEARN THREE LANGUAGES WITHOUT AN ACCENT REFLECIVELY WHEREAS ADULTS IT'S VERY CHALLENGING IT TAKES A LOT MORE EFFORT AND STRAIN A LOT MORE OF THAT DURATION PATH OUTCOME KIND OF THINKING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE PLASTIC CHANGES WE NOW KNOW HOWEVER THAT THE ADULT BRAIN CAN CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE NOBELL PRIZES WERE GIVEN FOR A THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE YOUNG BRAIN CAN CHANGE VERY DRAMATICALLY I THINK ONE OF THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLES WOULD BE OF FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE BLAUNT BORN BLIND FROM BIRTH THEY USE THE AREA OF THEIR BRAIN THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE USED FOR VISUALIZING OBJECTS IN COLORS AND THINGS OUTSIDE OF THEM FOR BRAIL READING IN BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES AT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND FROM BIRTH WHEN THEY BRAIL READ THE AREA THE BRAIN THAT WOULD NORMALLY A LIGHT UP A IF YOU WILL TO FOR VISION LIGHTS UP FOR BRAIL READING SO THAT REAL ESTATE IS REALICATED FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FUNCTION IF SOME ONE IS MADE BLIND IN ADULTHOOD IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEIR ENTIRE VISUAL BRAIN WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THEIR RESPONSIBLE FOR TOUCH HOWEVER THERES SOME EVIDENCE THAT AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAN REVOLVED IN HEARING AND TOUCH CAN CAN A MIGRATE INTO THAT AREA AND THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTS NOW AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MORE PLASTICITY CAN BE IN DUCED IN ADULTHOOD MORE POSITIVE PLASTICITY AND IN ORDER UNDERSTAND THAT PROCESS WE REALLY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT AT FIRST SEEM TOTALLY DIVORCED FROM NERL PLASTICITY BUT ACTUALLY LIES AT THE CENTER OF NERL PLASTISY AND FOR ANY OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN CHANGING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT CAN GO FROM BEING VERY HARD OR SEEM ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND OUT OF REACH TO BEING VERY REFLECIVE THIS IS IN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO PLASTICITY IN THE ADULT HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM IS GAITED MEANING IT IS CONTROLLED BY NEUROMOGULATORS THESE THINGSTHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER DOPAMIN CERETONAN AND ONE IN PARTICULAR R ECALL THE SEAT OF COLING OR WHAT OPEN UP PLASTICITY THEY LITERALLY UNVAIL PLASTICITY AND ALLOW BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME IN WHICH WHATEVER INFORMATION WHATEVER THING WERE SENSING OR PERCEIVING OR THINKING WHATEVER EMOTIONS WE FEEL CAND LITERALLY BE MAPPED IN THE BRAIN SUCH THAT LATER IT WILL BECOME MUCH EASIER FOR US TO EXPERIENCE AND FEEL THAT THING THIS HAS A DARKSIDE AND A POSITIVE SIDE THE DARKSIDE IS ITSASHY VERY EASY TO GET NURAL PLASTICITY AS AN ADULT THROUGH TRAMATIC OR TERRIBLE OR CHALLENGING EXPERIENCES BUT THE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS TO SAY WHY IS THAT AND THE REASON THAT'S THE CASE IS BECAUSE WHEN SOMETHING VERY BAD HAPPENS THERE'S THE RELEASE OF TWO SETS OF NURMODULATORS IN THE BRAIN EPINEPERON WHICH TENDS TO MAKE US FEEL ALRT AN AGITATED WHICH IS ASSOCIATE WITH MOTS BAD CIRCUMSTANCES AND A SEDO CALING WHICH TENDS TO CREATE A EVEN MORE INTENSE AND FOCUSED PERCEPTIONAL SPOTLIGHT EMEMBER EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PERCEPTION AND HOW IT'S COME LIKE A SPOTLIGHT A SEDO CALING MAKES THAT LIGHT PARTICULARLY BRIGHT AND PARTICULARLY RESTRICTED TO ONE REGION OF OUR EXPERIENCE AND IT DOES THAT BY MAKING CERTAIN NURONS IN OUR BRAIN AND AND BODY ACTIVE MUCH MORE THAN ALL THE RESS SO A SETO OALING A SORTER LIKE A HIGHLIGHT OR MARKER UPON WHICH NURAL PLASTICITY THEN COMES IN LATER AND SAYS WEIGHT WHICH NURONS WERE ACTIVE IN THIS PARTICULARLY ON ALERTING PHASE OF WHATEVER YON DAY OR NIGHT WHENEVER THIS THING HAPPEN TO HAPPEN SO THE WAY IT WORKS AS THIS YOU CAN THINK OF EPINEFERON AS CREATING THIS ALERTNESS IN THIS KIND OF UNBELIEVABLE LEVEL OF INCREASED ATTENTION COMPARED TO WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCING BEFORE AND YOU CAN THINK OF ASEDOCOALING AS BEING THE MOLECULE THAT HIGHLIGHTS WHATEVER IT HAPPENS DURING THAT PERIOD OF HEIGHTEN ALERTNESS SO JUST TO BE CLEARITS ITS EPINEPERIN CRATES THE ALERTNESS THAT'S COMING FROM A SUBSET OF NUROS IN THE BRAINSTEM IF YOUR INTERESTED AND A SEDO COALING COMING FROM AN AREA THE FOREBRAIN IS TAGGING OR MARKING THE NURONS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY ACTIVE DURING THIS HEIGHTEN LEVEL OF ALERTNESS NOW THAT MARKS THE CELLS THE NURONS AND THE SYNAPSES FOR STRENGTHENING FOR BECOMING MORE LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE IN THE FUTURE EVEN WITHOUT US THINKING ABOUT IT OK SO IN BAD CIRCUMSTANCES THIS ALL HAPPENS WITHOUT US HAVING TO DO MUCH WHEN WE WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN HOWEVER WE WANT ALEARN A NEW LANGUAGE WE WANT TO LEARN A NEW SKILL WE WANT TO BECOME MORE MOTIVATED WHAT DO WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN WE KNOW THAT THAT PROCESS OF GETTING NURAL PLASTICITY SO THAT WE HAVE MORE FOCUS MORE MOTIVATION ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES THE RELEASE OF EPINEPERON WE HAVE TO HAVE ALERTNESS IN ORDER TO HAVE FOCUS AND WE HAVE TO HAVE FOCUS IN ORDER TO DIRECT THOSE PLASTIC CHANGES TO PARTICULAR PARTS OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THIS HAS IMMENSE IMPLICATIONS IN THINKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS TOOLS WHETHER NOT THOSE ARE CHEMICAL TOOLS OR MACHINE TOOLS OR JUST SELF INDUCED REGIMENS OF HOW LONG OR HOW INTENSELY YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS IN ORDER TO GET NERL PLASTICITY BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO IT THE DIRTY SECRET OF NERL PLASTICITY IS THAT NO NERL PLASTICITY OCCURS JURING THE THING YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN DURING THE TERRIBLE EVENT DURING THE GREAT EVENT DURING THE THING THAT YOURE REALLY TRYING TO SHAPE AND LEARN NOTHING IS ACTUALLY CHANGING BETWEEN THE NURONS THAT IS GOING TO LAST ALL THE NERL PLASTICITY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE SENNAPSES THE ADDITION IN SOME CASES OF NEW NERVE CELLS OR AT LEAST CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NERVE CELLS ALL OF THAT OCCURS AT A VERY DIFFERENT PHASE OF LIFE WHICH IS WHEN WE ARE IN SLEEP AND NON SLEEP DEEP REST AND SO NERL PLASTICITY WHICH IS THE KIND OF WHOLLY GRAIL OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE OF NOW THIS IS THE NEW YEAR AND EVERYONE'S THINKING NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS AND RIGHT NOW PERHAPS EVERYTHINGIS ORGANIZED AND PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN MARCH OR APLE OR MAY WELL THAT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ATTENSION AND FOCIS ONE CON CONTINUALLY BRING TO WHATEVER IT IS THEIR TRYING TA LEARN SO MUCH SO THAT AGITATION AND A FEELING OF STRAIN ARE ACTUALLY REQUIRED FOR THIS PROCESS OF NERL PLASTISTY TO GET TRIGGERED BUT THE ACTUAL REWIRING OCCURS DURING PERIODS OF SLEEP AND NON SLEEP DEEP REST S A STUDY PUBLISHED LAST YEAR THAT'S PARTICULARLY RELEVANT HERE THAT I WANT A SHARE WAS NOT DONE BY MY LABORATORY THAT SHOWED THAT TWENTY MINUTES OF DEEP REST THIS IS NOT DEEP SLEEP BUT ESSENTIALLY DOING SOMETHING VERY HARD AND VERY INTENS AND THEN TAKING TWENTY MINUTES AFTERWARD IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS TO DELIBERATELY TURN OFF THE DELIBERATE FOCUSED THINKING AND ENGAGEMENT ACTUALLY CELERATED NERL PLASTICITY THERE'S ANOTHER STUDY THAT'S JUST INCREDIBLE AND OREGAN TO GO INTO THIS IN A A FUTURE EPISODE OF THE PODCAST NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW THAT SHOWED THAT IF PEOPLE ARE LEARNING A PARTICULAR SKILL IT COULD BE A LANGUAGE SKILL OR A MOTOR SKILL AND THEY HEAR A TONE JUST PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND A THE TONE IS PLAYING PERIODICALLY THROUGH BACKGROUND LIKE JUST A BELL IN DEEP SLEEP IF THAT BELL IS PLAYED LEARNING IS MUCH FASTER FOR THE THING THAT THEY WERE LEARNING WHILE THEY WERE AWAKE IT SOMEHOW CUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN SLEEP USND EVEN TO HAVE TO BE IN DREAMING THAT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN ARE THE WAKING PHASE WAS THE SPECIALLY IMPORTANT SO MUCH SO THAT THAT BELL IS SORT OF A PAVALOVIAN CUE IT'S OVER REMINDER TO THE SLEEPING BRAIN OH YOU NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WERE LEARNING AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY AND THE LEARNING RATES AND THE RATES OF OF RETENSION MEANING HOW MUCH PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER FROM THE THING THEY LEARN ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS SO I'M GOINGTO TALK ABOUT HOW TO APPLY ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THIS PODCAST EPISODE BUT ALSO IN FUTURE EPISODES BUT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE WREALLY KEY IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP AND FOCUS THESE TWO OPPOSITE ENDS OF OUR ATTENTIONAL STATE WHEN WE'RE IN SLEEP THESE DEPEOS DURATION PATH AND OUTCOME ANALYSIS ARE IMPOSSIBLE WE JUST CAN'T DO THAT WE ARE ONLY IN RELATION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE OF US SO SLEEP IS KEY ALSO KEY OUR PERIODS OF NON SLEEP DEEP REST WHERE WE'RE TURNING OFF OUR ANALYSIS OF DURATION PATH AND OUTCOME IN PARTICULAR FOR THE THING THAT WE WERE JUST TRYING TO LEARN AND WE'RE IN THIS KIND OF O LIMINAL STATE WHERE OUR ATTENTION IS KIND OF DRIFTING ALL OVER TURNS OUT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CONSOLIDATION FOR THE CHANGES BETWEEN THE NERVE CELLS THAT WILL ALLOW WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO LEARN TO GO FROM BEING DELIBERATE AND HARD AND STRESSFUL AND A STRAIN TO EASY AND REFLEXIVE THIS ALSO POINTS TO HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE INCLUDING MANY MODERN CLINITIONS ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PREVENT BAD CIRCUMSTANCEIS TRAMAS FROM ROUTING THEIR WAY INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM PERMANENTLY IT SAYS THAT WE MIGHT WANT INTER FEAR WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF BRAIN STATES THAT ARE AWAY FROM THE BAD THING THAT HAPPEN THAT HAPPE THE BRAIN STATES THAT HAPPEN THE NEXT DAY OR THE NEXT MONTH OR THE NEXT YEAR AND ALSO I WANT O BE A WHAY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I PAY ATTENTION OF THE FACT THAT FOR MANY OF YOU YOUARE THINKINGABOUT NERAL PLASTISCITY NOT JUST IN CHANGING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO ADD SOMETHING NEW BUT TO ALSO GET RID OF THINGS THAT YOU DON'T LIKE RIGHT THAT YOU WANT OF FORGET BAD EXPERIENCES OR AT LEAST REMOVE THE EMOTIONAL CONTINGENCY OF A BAD RELATIONSHIP OR A BAD RELATIONSHIP TO SOME THING OR SOME PERSON OR SOME EVENT LEARNING TO FEAR CERTAIN THINGS LESS TO ELIMINATE APHOBIA TO ERACE A TRAMA THE MEMORIES THEMSELVES DON'T GET ERACED I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT THE MEMORIES DON'T THEMSELVES GET A RACE BUT THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF MEMORIES CAN BE REDUCED AND THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT THEY ALL REQUIRE THIS THNG THAT WERE CALO CALLING NERLPLASTICITY WE CAN HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NERL PLASTICITY AN DEPTH BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT IS INDEED A TOOPHASED PROCESS WHAT GOVERNS THE TRANSITION BETWEEN ALERT AND FOCUSED AND THESE DEEP RESSED AND DEEP SLEEP STATES IS A SYSTEM IN OUR BRAIN ENBODY A CERTAIN ASPECT OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CALLED THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IT IS IMMENSELY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS IT HAS NAMES LIKE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AN PARIS SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTM WHICH FRANKLY ARE COMPLICATED NAMES BECAUSE THEIRE LOBIT MIS LEADING SYMPATHETIC IS THE ONE THAT ASSOCIAT WITH MORE ELERTNESS PARA SYMPATHETIC IS THE ONE THAT ASSOCIATE WITH MORE CALMNESS AND IT GETS REALLY MISLEADING BECAUSE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SOUNDS LIKE SYMPATHY AND THEN PEOPLE THINK IT'S RELATE TO CALM I'M'T A CALLED THE ELERTNOUS SYSTEM AND TE CALMNESS SYSTEM BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH A SYMPATHETIC IMPARISYMPATHETIC ARE SOMETIMES USE PEOPLE REALLY GET CONFUSED SO THE WA TE TO THINK ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE BUT IN PARTICULAR FOR NERAL PLASTICITY AND ENGAGING IN THESE FOCUS STATES AND THAN THESE DEFOCUS STATES IS THAT IT WORK SORT OF LIKE A SEA SAW EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT GROGGY BUT THEN GENERALLY WERE MORE ALERT AND THAN AS EVENING COMES AROUND WE TEND TO BECOME A LITTLE MORE RELAXED AND SLEEP AN EVENTUALLY AT SOME POIN AT NIGHT WE GO TO SLEEP SO WE GO FROM ALERT TO DEEPLY CALM AND AS WE DO THAT WE GO FROM AN ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN THESE VERY FOCUSE DURATION PATH OUTCOME TYPES OF ANALYSIES TO STATES IN SLEEP THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIVORCE FROM DURATION PATH AND OUTCOME IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS COMPLETELY RANDOM AND UNTETHERED IN TERMS OF OUR SENSATIONS PERCEPTIONS AND FEELINGS AND SO FORTH SO EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE HAVE A PHASE OF OUR DAY THAT IS OPTIMAL FOR THINKING AND FOCUSING AND LEARNING AND NERL PLASTICITY AND DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS WE HAVE ENERGY AS WELL AND IN ANOTHER PHASE OF OUR DAY WERE TIRED AND WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO FOCUS WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN DURATION PATH OUTCOME TYPES OF ANALYSIES AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT BOTH PHASES ARE IMPORTANT FOR SHAPING OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE WAYS THAT WE WANT SO IF WE WANT TO ENGAGE INERAL PLASTICITY AND WE WANT TO GET THE MOST OF UT OUT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WE EACH HAFE TO MASTER THAT BOTH THE TRANSITION BETWEEN WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP AND THETRANSITION BETWEEN SLEEP AND E WAKEFULNESS NOW SO MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF THE IMPORTANCS OF SLEEP AND IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR WOUND HEALING FOR LEARNING AS I JUST MENTIONED FOR CONSOLIDATING LEARNING FOR ALL ASPECTS OF OUR MUNE SYSTEM IT IS THE ONE PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH WE ARE NOT DOING THESE DURATION PATH AND OUTCOMES TYPES OF ANALYSIES AND IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ALL ASPECTS OF OUR OALTH INCLUDING OUR LONGEVITY MUCH LESS HAS BEEN MADE HOWEVER OF HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING HOW TO GET BETTER AT THE PROCESS THAT INVOLVES FALLING A SLEEP STAYING OF SLEEP AND ACCESSING THESE STATES OF MIND EMBODY THAT INVOLVE TOTAL PARALYSIS MUST FE WILL DON NOTHIS BE RACTAL PARALYZE DURING MUCH OF YOUR SLEEP S THAT YOU CAN'T ACT OUT YOUR DREAMS PRESUMABLY BUT ALSO WHERE YOUR BRAIN IS IN A TOTAL IDAL STATE WHERE IT'S NOT CONTROLLING ANYTHING IT'S JUST LEFT TO KIND OF FREE RUN AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO IN ORDER TO MASTER THAT TRANSITION IN ORDER TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING AND IT INVOLVES MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW MUCH WE SLEEP WE'RE ALL BEING TOLD OF COURSE THAT WE NEED TO SLEEP MORE BUT THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF SLEEP QUALITY ACCESSING THOSE DEEP STATES OF NON D PO THINKING ACCESSING THE RIGHT TIMING OF SLEEP NOT A LOT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED PUBLICLY AS FAR AS I'M AWARE OF WHEN TO TIME YOUR SLEEP I THINK WE ALL CAN APPRECIATE THAT SLEEPING FOR HALF AN HOUR THROUGHOUT THE DAY OM SO THAT YOU GET A TOTAL OF EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE IS PROBABLY VERY DIFFERENT AND NOT OPTIMAL COMPARED TO A SOLID BLOCK OF EIGHT HOURS OF S SLEEP ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TRIED THIS I THINK OF SBEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IN VARIOUS BOOKS NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN STICK TO THAT SCHEDUL INCIDENTALLY I THING IT'S CALLED THE UBERMEN SCHEDUL NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE HUBERMEN SCHEDUL BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL MY SCHEDUEL DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND SECOND OF ALL I WOULD NEVER ATTEMPT SUCH A SLEEPING REGIME THE OTHER THING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IS THAT WE HAVE NOT EXPLORED AS A CULTURE THE RHYTHMS THAT OCCUR IN OUR WAKING STATES SO MUCH HAS BEEN FOCUSD ON THE VALUE OF SLEEP IN THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP WHICH IS GREAT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT HAPPENING IN THEIR WAKING STATES AND WHEN THEIR BRAIN IS OPTIMIZED FOR FOCUS WHEN THEIR BRAIN IS OPTIMIZED FOR THESE DEPEOS THESE DURATION PATH OUTCOME TYPES OF ENGAGEMENTS FOR LEARNING AND FOR CHANGING AND WHEN THEIR BRAIN IS PROBABLY BETTER SUITED FOR MORE REFLECTSIVE THINKING AN BEHAVIORS AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS A VAST AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC DATA WHICH POINTS TO THE EXISTENCE OF WHAT ARE CALLED ALL TRADIAN RHYTHMS MAY HAVE HEARD A CIRCADAN RHYTHMS CIRCADEAN MEANS CIRCA ABOUT A DAY SO AS TWENTY FOUR HOUR RHYTHMS CAUSE THE EARTH SPINS ONCE EVERY TWEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS ALL TRADIAN RHTHMS OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN AND THEY REQUIRE LESS TIME THEIR SHORTER THE MOST IMPORTANTAL TRADIAN RHYTHM FOR SAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION IS THE NINETY MINUTE RHYTHM THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH ALL THE TIME IN ARE OUR ABILITY TO ATTEND IN FOCUS AND IN SLEEP WE ARE OUR SLEEP IS BROKEN UP INTO NINETY MINUTES SEGMENTS EARLY IN THE NIGHT WE HAVE MORE PHASE ONE AND FACE TO LIGHTER SLEEP AND THEN WE GOIN TO OUR DEEPER FACE TREE IN FACE FOR SLEEP AND THEN WE RETURN TO FASE ONE TO THREE FOR SO ALL NIGHT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THESE ALTRADIAN RHYTHMS OF STAGE ONE TO THREE FOR ONE TO THREE FOR ITS REPEATING MOST PEOPLE PERHAPS KNOW THAT MAY BE THEY DON'T BUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING THESE ALTRADEAN RHYTHMS CONTINUE AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WE ARE OPTIMIZED FOR FOCUS AND ATTENTION WITHIN THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES SO THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES MAYBE SIT DOWN TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW OR TO ENGAGE IN SOME NEW CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR FOR THE FIRST FIVE OR TEN MINUTES OF ONE OF THOSE CYCLES IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT THE BRAIN AND THE NERAL CIRCUTS AND THE NEROMODULATORS ARE NOT GOING TO BE OPTIMALLY TUNE TO WHATEVER IT IS YOUR TRYING TO DO BUT AS YOU DROP DEEPER INTO THAT NINETY MINUTE CYCLE YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND TO ENGAGE IN THIS DEPEO PROCESS AND TO DIRECNERAL PLASTICITY AN TO LEARN IS ACTUALLY MUCH GREATER AND THEN YOU EVENTUALLY POP OUT OF THT AT THE END OF THE NINETY MINUTE CYCLE SO THESE CYCLES ARE OCCURRING IN SLEEP AND THE CYCLES ARE OCCURRING IN WAKEFULNESS AND ALL OF THOSE ARE GOVERNED BY THIS SEESAW OF ALERTNESS TO CALMNESS THAT WE CALL THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO F YOU WANT TO MASTER IN CONTROL YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM REGARDLESS OF WHAT TOOL YOU REACH TO WHETHER NOT A A PHARMICALOGIC TOOL OR WHETHER NOT AS A BEHAVIRAL TOOL OR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE TOOL IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR ENTIRE EXISTENCE IS OCCURRING IN THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES WHETHER NOT YOUR SLEEP OR AWAKE AND SO YOU REALLY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO WEDGE INTO THOSE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES AND FOR INSTANCE IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY CRAZY AND COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO TRY IN JUST LEARN INFORMATION WHILE IN DEEP SLEEP BY LISTENING TO THAT INFORMATION CAUS YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO ACCES IT IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY GOOD HOWEVER TO ENGAGE IN A FOCUS BOUT OF LEARNING EACH DAY AND NOW WE KNOW HOW LONG THAT FOCUS ABOUT OF LEARNING SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE NINETY MINUTE CYCLE AND THE EXPECTATION SHOULD BE THAT THE EARLY PHASE OF THAT CYCLE IS GOIN TO BE CHALLENGING IT'S GIN TO HEART IT'S NOCK IN A FEEL NATURAL ITS NOCK IN A FEEL LIKE FLOW BUT THAT YOU CAN LEARN AND THE CIRCUITS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT INVOLVED IN FOCUS IN MOTIVATION CAN LEARN TO DROP IN TO A MODE OF MORE FOCUS GET MORE NERAL PLASTICITY IN OTHER WORDS BY ENGAGING THESE ALTRADIAN CYCLES AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES OF DAY FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY GOOD LEARNERS EARLY IN THE DAY AND NOT SO GOOD IN THE AFTERNOON SO YOU CAN START TO EXPLORE THIS PROCESS EVEN WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNDERLYING NERO CHEMICLS BY SIMPLY PAING ATTENTION NOT JUST TO WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP AND WHEN YOU WAKE UP EACH MORNING HOW DEEP OR HOW SHALLOW YOUR SLEEP FELT YOU SUBJECTIVELY BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHEN YOUR BRAIN TENDS TO BE MOST ANXIOUS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT HAS A COROLET RELATED TO PERCEPTION THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF WHEN YOU MOST FOCUS WHEN YOU LEAST ANXIOUS WHEND YOU FEEL MOST MOTIVATED WHEN YOU FEEL MOST  LEAST MOTIVATED BY UNDERSTANDING HOW THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF YOUR PERCEPTION SENSATION FEELING THOUGHT AND ACTIONS TEND TO WANT TO BE ENGAGED OR NOT WANT TO BE ENGAGED YOU DEVELOP A VERY GOOD WINDOW INTO WHAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO SHIFT YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS OR SHIFT YOUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN CREATIVE TYPE THINKING AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE AND SO THAT'S WHERE WERE HEADING GOING FORWARD IT ALL STARTS WITH MASTERING THIS SEA SAW THAT IS THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT AT A COURSE LEVEL IS A TRANSITION BETWEEN WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP BUT AT A FINER LEVEL AND JUST AS IMPORTANT ARE THE VARIOUS CYCLES THESE ALL TRADIG NINETY MINUTE CYCLES THAT GOVERN OUR LIFE ALL THE TIME TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY EVERY DAY OF OUR LIFE AND SO WE'RE GOIN TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN TAKE CONTROL THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO THAT YOU CAN BETTER ACCESS NERAL PLASTICITY BETTER ACCESS SLEEP EVEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PHASE THAT IS THE TRANSITION BETWEEN SLEEP AND WAKING TO ACCESS THINGS LIKE CREATIVITY AND SO FORTH ALL BASED ON STUDIES THE HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS MAINLY WITHIN E LAST TEN YEARS AND SOME THAT ARE VERY VERY NEW AND THAT POINT TO TE USE OF SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO TO DAY WE COVERED A LOT OF INFORMATION IF WAS SORT OF A WHIRLWIND TOUR OF EVERYTHING FROM NURONS AND SENAPSES TO NERL PLASTICITY IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WE WILL REVISIT A LOT OF THESE THEMES GOING FOR ARD SO IF ALL OF THAT DIDN'T SINK IN IN ONE PAST A PLEASE DON'T WORRY WE WILL A COME BACK TO THESE THENES OVER AND OVER AGAIN I WANTED TO EQUIP YOU WITH A LANGUAGE THAT WERE ALL DEVELOPING A KIND OF COMMON BASE SET OF INFORMATION GOING FORWARD AND I HOPE THE INFORMATION IS VALUABLE TO YOU IN YOUR THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS WORKING WELL FOR YOU AND IS WHAT'S WORKING LESS WELL AND WHAT'S BEEN EXCEEDINGLY CHALLENGING WHAT'S BEEN EASY FOR YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR PURSUIT OF PARTICULAR BEHAVIORS OR EMOTIONAL STATES WHERE YOUR CHALLENGES ORE THE CHALLENGES OF PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW MIGHT RESIDE AS PROMISED IN OUR WELCOME VIDIO THE FORMAD OF THE HUBERAN LAB PODCAST IS TO DIVE DEEP INTO INDIVIDUAL TOPICS FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH AT A TIME SO IR THE ENTIRE MONTH OF JANUARY WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE THIS INCREDIBLE STATE THAT IS SLEEP AND A RELATED STATE WHICH IS NON SLEEP DEEP REST AND WHAT THEY DO FOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING RESETTING OUR EMOTIONAL CAPACITY AND RUNS PROBATLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT ONE WERE SLEEP DEPRIVED WERE SO MUCH LESS GOOD AT DEALING WITH LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE MORE EMOTIONALLY LABILE WHY IS THAT HOW IS THAT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OREGIN TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING AND HOW TO ACCESS BETTER SLEEP EVEN WHEN YOUR SLEEP TIMING OR DURATION IS COMPROMISED WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DATA THAT SUPPORT THIS VERY INTERESTING STATE CALLED NON SLEEP DEEP REST WHERE ONE IS NEITHER SLEEP NOR AWAKE BUT IT TURNS OUT ONE CAN RECOVER SOME OF THE NAROMOGULATORS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SENSATION PERCEPTION FEELING THOUGHT AND ACTION IT'S SURE TO BE A VERY RICH DISCUSSION BACK AND FORTH WHERE I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS AND PROVIDING TOOLS AND I'M CERTAIN YOUARE ALSO GOING TO LEARN A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT NUR SCIENCE AND WHAT MAKES UP THIS INCREDIBLE PHASE OF YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT CONSCIOUS BUT YOUR ACTUALLY RESETTING AND RENEWING YOURSELF IN ORDER TO PERFORM BETTER FEEL BETTER ET CETERA IN THE WAKING STATE IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE PODCAST PLEASE

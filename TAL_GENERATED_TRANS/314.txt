FROM W  E S CHICAGO IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIFE I'M KONDA JOFF YO WALT SITTING IN FOR IRA GLASS IRIT IS HERE BUT I'M TAKING OVER TO DAYS SHOW BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUESTIONS THAT I THINK OURE PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL OF US AT VERIOUS POINTS IN OUR LIVES BUT ARE ESPECIALLY PRESSING FOR ME THESE DAYS I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN WITH A BRIEF EXAMPLE OF A SITUATION I FIND MYSELF IN ALL THE TIME LATELY WITH MY TWO CHILDREN FEELING DEEPLY LOST IT'S BATHTIME JACOB THE OLDER ONE IS RUNNING A RESTAURANT BE'S GIVING OUT GRIEF PRIZES CUPS WERE GROWN UPS AND ALL SO ANIMALS I WON ONN ANIMAL  IK OF SAYS IF SOME ONE IN YOUR FAMILY IS CHRISTIAN HE CAN GET ONE OF THOSE   AN  W   NO OI TA NO  THEROD YOU  HE SNATCHES THE ANIMAL AND SAYS SORRY W Y CAN'T HAVE ANY ANIMALS  CHRISTIAN  SWHY CAN A  I NO JEWS ALOUD SAYS MY THREE AND A HALF YEAR OLD TO MY JEWISH FACE O  A   SO HERE IS MY QUESTION WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY WRIT HERE BECUSE I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING WRIGHT I SHOULD SAY THAT IS NAT O KAY BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE I SAID SO BECAUSE YOU'RE A JEW BECAUSE JEWS LIKE YOUR GREAT GRANDPARENTS WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES BY EXACTLY THE MENTALITY YOU'VE JUST EXPRESSD TO ME  MY GREE AND HALF YOURA BOY OR BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A MAJORITY CHRISTIAN COUNTRY AND I'M WORRIED THAT I'VE CLEARLY ALREADY FAILED TO PROVIDE YOU ITH THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP TO JUDISM OR IS THE BEST APPROACH NOT TO SAY ANYTHING HE'S JUST HAVING YAU BATH I DON'T KNOW AS YOU WILL HERE BUT PLED IS  IT'S NOT NICE TO SAY THAT SOMEBODY CAN NOT SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AY    YOU'R NCHR   O  IIAVE ATHY AL O SWEE   ANY Y R  NCRI  I SO MANY RULES IN THIS SANY CO MINIT RESTAROUND      HE SAYS THEYRE KIND FOR SOME PEOPLE JOS NOT MY KIND OF PEOPLE OW E THE PROBLEM WITH TALKINGKIDS ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANC BIS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING IT'S YOUR JAB TO TEACH THEM ABOUT ALL THE STUFF THAT MATTERS MOST BAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORK WITH THEY DON'T KNOW RELIGION THEY DON'T KNO HISTORY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TA MAINTAIN PROPER HYGEN ALSO A PROBLEM THEY'RE LITTLE AND THEY HAVE FEELINGS SO YOU HAVE TO BE CHAREFUL ABOUT SAYING WELL PLENTY TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A MAN NAMED AT OFF PITLER YOU WOULD HAVE LIKE THE WAY YOU RUN YOUR RESTAURANT BY THE WAY WE'VE ALL BEEN ON THE KID SIDE OF THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION WHERE A GROWN UP IS FUMBLING THROUGH WITH SOME THING THAT IS CLEARLY IMPORTANT THE BIG ONE MOST OF US REMEMBER IS WHEN SOME ONE TOLD US ABOUT SEX AND ON THE ADULT SIDE WHATEVER THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS SEX WHAT IS GOD OR WHAT IS ISIS WHAT IS TRANSGENDER ME YOU KNOW IN THAT MOMENT THAT WHAT YOU SAY COULD REALLY MATTERR  COULD BE THE THING THIS PERSON REMEMBERS AND CARRIES WITH THEM INTO ADULTED COULD SHAPE THE WAY THEY FEEL ABOUT THEIR SAFETY FOR THEIR SEXUALITY THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE HOW WE MAKE ARE MARK ON THE NEXT GENERATION THEY ARE ALSO VERY OFTEN HOW WE LEARN HOW MUCH WE DO NT KNOW AND INTO DAY SHOW WE'RE GIN A LISTEN IN AS PEOPLE TAK ON THREE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS TO TALK

A LOT ABOUT OUR RELUCTANCE TO SPEAK OF ITS EXISTENCE O GET LET'S START WITH THE BEGINNING ONE WAY A LOT OF KIDS LEARN ABOUT THE BIRDS AND BEES IS FROM EACH OTHER THE SEVEN YEAR OLD NAME MOXY TOLD ME A

THA HALF THE THINGS YOUR BROTHER TOLD YOU WE'RE NOT RIGHT THAT THAT SEEN IN THE MOVY IS NOT REALIS IT THAT SOPHIA DISANTOS WAS LYING WHEN SHE SAYS SHE DID THAT THING BECAUSE THAT THING IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT'S BUSILY OUR SYSTEM YOU LEARN THINGS WRONG TAST THEM OUT AND HOPEFULLY GET THE REAL STORY FROM SOME ONE MA MOXON THIS BEGINS ON THE PLAYGROUND AND JUST CONTINUES ALL THE WAY UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY START HAVING SEX AND ALL THE WEIRD INFORMATION THAT WAS NOT CORRECTED BEGINS TO MATTER YOU HOPING TERE GOING TO COBER HOPECL WEBI TEONDRE IS IN A CLASS ROM AT BUFFALO STATE WITH ABOUT FIFTY OTHER PEOPLE MOSTLY MEN MOSTLY HIS FRATERNITY BROTHERS HEU'S HER FOR SOME SEX AT I BO GA SHE SHPE L OL E W DON' YOU KNO  I ADLGA SHA GOOD QUESTION YOU KNOW THIS IS A VOLUNTARY WORKSHOP ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT AN CONSENT ON A MONDAY NIGHT YOU THINK THIS EVENT MIGHT NOT WENT OUT OVER SAY PITTING UP THE JOMPA JUSE OR STARING AT YOUR VANGOPOSTER BUT THIS ROOM IS POCKE THE STUDENTS ARE WIDE AWAKE KNEES ARE BOUNCING HANDS ARE SHOOTING UP IN THE AIR THE INSTRUCTOR PAULOMAGRICAL IS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSENT O CONSENT IS A VERBAL AND ENTHUSIASTIC YES O KA WHY IS IT ENTHUSIASTIC YOU WHY EXACTLY YOU WANT TO DO IT AND SEX SHOULD BE WHY RA YET I HOPE SO THIS KIND OF WORSHOP WAS REPEATED IN CRASSROOMS ALL A CRASS CAMPAS HERE AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THE LAST YERE COLLEGE ADMINISTRATORS ARE PANIC ABOUT SEXUAL SALT AS THEY SHOULD BE SO THEYRE TURNING TO THIS KIND OF EDUCATION AS THE ANSWER INSTEAD OF MOSTLY FOCUSSING ON PROTECTING WOMEN THINGS LIKE GRAPE WHISTLES IR TRAVEL WITH A BUTTY PROGRAMS THEY ALSO WANE TO TEACH MEN ACTUAL SENTENCES TO SAY DO YOU LIKE THIS CAN I KISS YOU BUT THE SINS HERE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE BESIC PREMIS THEY HAVE TO LEARN TO SPEAK IN THIS NEW WAY BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOUR RAPEST BECAUSE IT'S JUST MORE VIRTUOUS THEY HAVE QUESTIONS RITE FROM THE START IT'S A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF CHECKING UP SO WHAT IT ARE CHECKING IN EITHER OR WHAT IES THAT MEAN WA IT SE SAYS YES IF SHE SAYS YES ON MUCH O WHENY WA IF SHE SAYS YES AT THIS SYOU KNOWS SHE YOU SAYING YE I GOGT TO BE LIKE E O SURE YOU KNOW YOU REALLY SURE LIKE YOU NOGT TO DO TIS I'M ALMOST TE AM O TH GO A SHET THIL YOU KNOW GET THE PROTECTION NO NOT YOU AR YOU RE YOU WRA YOU RAE W NO ON YOUSELF AN I STOP BIKE BUT THE KEEP TO WE EFFORMATION OF YES OER NOBGAIN THE CONTO WOU MISS OF THE MOVE SHOPE LKE SHOULD THER BE A NUMBER OF TOMS THAT SHE SUS YOU KNOW HE PRESSES THEM ON THIS TO THREE SEVEN BUT THAT GUY IS OVERTAKEN BY HIS FRATERNITY BROTHERS WHO ALSO HAVE URGENT QUESTIONS DOES BODY LANGUAGE COUNTESS CONSENT WHAT IF SHE SAID YEST BEFORE YOU GOT INTO THE ROOM WHEN YOU ARE BOTH SOBER LIKE AND A MESSAGE ON TWITTER SOMETHING HOW MANY BEERS IS TOO MUCH TO HAVE CONSENT AGAIN PLEASE OFFER AND

ASK FOR CONSENT ANOTHER SUDENT OK WHAT IF WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR A YEAR PAULOMAGRIGAL REPLIES YOU ALWAYS NEED CONSENT EVEN IF YOURE WOMAN EVEN IF YOUR MAN SLEEPING WITH MEN EVEN IF YOU'RE IN E RELATIONSHIP EVE IF YOU HAVE SEX EVERY DAY EVEN IF YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF SEC OR IF YOU GUISE ARE ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND MAY BE ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEONE DECIDE I WANT TO TRY IT ROUGH IF YOU GUIS ALREADY STARREADY HAVING SECT SO THAT THE OTHER PERSON CAN WITHDRAW THAT CONSENT O KA SO THAT'S WHY IT'S ACTIVE WHAT IF SOME ONE'S LIKE I WANT TO HAV ANOTHER PERSON HERE NOW LET'S HAVE THREE PEOPLE YOU ALREADY HAVEN SEX SO IF ALL A SUDE THE'RE LIKE SURPRISE I HAVE ANOTHER PERSON O A YOU CAN BE LIKE YAT OM I DIDN'T REALLY SIGN UP FOR THAT IM NOT A HERE O KA DOES THAT MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE SENSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUNO CHECKING IN IN THE ACTIVE PROCESS THOSE ARE CAREFULLY CHOSEN EXAMPLES THE VAST MAJORITY OF SEXUAL SALTS ON COLLEGE CAPASSES OCCUR BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW EACH OTHER AND THERE'S NOT ALWAYS PHYSICAL FORCE SO PAULA IS TRYING TO SAY TAKE THE PICTURE YOU HAVE IN YOUR MIND OF A SERIAL PREDITOR RAPIST PUT IT TO THE SIDE FOR A MOMENT IMAGIN INSTEAD A PERSON WHO WAKES UP IN THE MORNING AND WONDERS QUIETLY TO HIMSELF SHE WAS INTO THAT RIGHT YET SHE WAS IN TO THAT IMAGINE THAT PERSON IS WRONG THE WORKSHOP WAS SUPPOSE TO BE FORTY FIVE MINUTES IT'S BEEN AN HOUR PALL A MADRIGAL IS TRYIN A WRAP UP SO HOW DO YOU GUI D YOU GUI A YAS FR HOW DO YOU GAS FOR CONSAT I IKA O LIKE IS LIKE MESS A GOLD MOLDLYS LY EXTET IT'S BEEN AN HOUR AND THE STUDENTS IN THIS ROOM ARE STILL FIXATED ON THIS QUESTION OF THE MOOD I DON'T REMEMBER THERE BEING A WHOLE LOT OF MOOD WHEN IT CAME TO SEX IN COLLEGE ADNNO MAYBE OUGAS ALL HAD CANDLEAT DORMROOMS BUT THERE IS GENUINE PANIC BEHIND THAT QUESTION IT'S DISMISSED IN A WORKSHOP ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT BECAUSE EF COURSE IT IS WERE TIKING BOUT ASSAULT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOOD THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE  CONVERSATIONS BUT THESE GAS ARE TRYING TO HAVE JUST ONE CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERYTHING E CONVERSATION THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CONSENT BUT BUSSO ALL F THEIR QUESTIONS AND ANXIETIES WHEN IT COMES TO TALKING TO A PERSON THEIR SLEEPING WITH IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S A CONVERSATION THEY'VE NEVER HAD THAT IS ONE OF THE HORDEST THINS EVERS SHE LIKE CHATIT ON FIND OUT HOW HOOULD GIU SY LIKE FONDAL WITH THE OTHER PERSONAL THIS IS NAGIB GANZALAS A COLLEGE FRESHMEN IN BUFFALO I KNOWN NAGIB FROM PREVIOUS REPORTING HE'S LOVELY AND LIKE EVERY FRESHMEN AT HIS SCHOOL HE'S BEEN TO A CONSENTRAINING IN THE LAST YEAR I FELL LIKE IF WERGANA LAY THE BURDEN OF CHANGING THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT SEX AT THE FEET OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TPEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY MANY YEARS INTO LEARNING WEIRD AND BAD AND CONFUSING INFORMATION IF THAT'S OUR ANSWER TO REDUCE SEXUAL ASSAULT I WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT THESE GUYS ACUALLY KNOW AND WHERE THEY LEARNED IT THEN TALKABOUT WOMEN ALL THE TIME THEY I JUST THOUGHT LIKE MOTON MAY ALWAY TALK TO ME ABOUT LIKE HIS FAVORITE SEX POSITION OR LIKE ANDN LOD THE FO TO TELL ME THEIR FAVOUR SEXMENTIONS AND THEN WE'LL JUST TALK ABOUT OH THAT'S COOL THAT'S OL I'LL TRY OUT ON WEN DER IT THOUHT TO MEN WHO ARE SLEEPING WITH WOMEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT WOMEN LIKE TWO OTHER MEN YET THAT SO IS JUST LIKE IT'S MORE LIKE ET WELL DECIDE WHAT WOMEN DO WHAT DON'T LIKE  WHEN YOU TAK TO WOMEN ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE  YET LOKI IS DEFILY MEN TALK TO MEN ABOUT WHAT WOMAN LIKE THAT'S HOW I FLIKE THAT'S HOWTE EVEN IF YOU GET TOLD BY WOMEN WHEN SHE LIKE YOU'LL BE LIKE OL I KNOW THAT I LATELY NAGIB'S BIGGEST SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS HIS ROOMATE ELIJA LESLY HE BROUGHT ELIJA UP A LOT ELIJA SAYS HE FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THE PERSON BES FROM HIS COUSIN THEN YOU GET OLDER THAN YOU SEE UKNO SPORTILASRETED THAN YOU SEE THE PLAYBOYS AN YOU SEE THE PORNN THAN YOU SEE THE GIRLS GONE WILE THAN YOU SEE THOSE LAKE LIKE THE GIRLS GO WILE T LATE LIKE COMMERCIALS SULP LIKE THAT LIKE THEE LIKE BORNA MORNIN GIRLS GO AWHILE THA LIKE I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHAKE WHEN YOU START LEARNING ELJA WAS NOT THE FIRST OR THE LAST PERSON I INTERVIEWED WHO TOLD ME HE LEARNED ABOUT SEX FROM CORN SO NAGIB IS LEARNING HOW TO ENGAGE WITH WOMEN FROM OTHER MEN WHO ARE LEARNING FROM PORN THAT S LIKE LEARNING CHINESE FROM A WHITE AMERICAN IND WYOMING HER MISSINGS SOME KEY PRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION EVERY PERSON I TALK TO WHO WORKS ON SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION BROUGHT UP ONE THING AS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING ABOUT THE WAY MEN LEARNE ABOUT SEX AND IT WASN'T PORN IT WAS BASEBALL THAT WE TALK ABOUT SEX LIKE ITS PACEBALL GETTING A HOME RUN AS A METAPHOR FOR SEX THEY SAID THINK OF HOW MANY BAD LESSONS ARE BUILT INTO THAT METAPHOR YOU GO FIRST BASE SECOND BAS THIR BAS THERE'S ONLY ONE DIRECTION TO MOVE IND A HOME RUN IS A WEN NOT TO MENTION YOU'RE ON OPPOSING TEAM IT'S COMPETITIVE AND IT'S A SORT THAT MOSTLY ONLY MEN PLAY NAGIB GINS ALICE IS NOT ATTACH TO SECS BEING LIKE BASEBALL OR BORN NAJIB JUST WANTS TO BE A GOOD PERSON HE WANTS TO BE GOOD TO PEOPLE

THAT NOT EVY GO LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU DO EVENOTHERS DIFFERENT EVERY ONE IS DIFFERENT GIRLS VRY HEOPLE VERY WHAT IF THAT WAS THE FIRST THING YOU LEARNED ABOUT SEC WHAT IF INSTEAD OF STARTING AT EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WITH RATE AND MOVING BACKWARDS TO TEACH CONSENT WHAT IF YOU JUST STARTED WITH PEOPLE VERY BECAUSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT CONSENT FOLLOWS YOU HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU LIKE AND DON'T LIKE OTHERWISE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOU MAY BE WITH ONE OF THOSE NECK PEOPLE AND YOU MAY NOT I TLI  FOR THE REST OF TO DAY SHOW WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE SECTS BEHIND AND WE ARE GOING

BOW YES THE HOST AT UNITED SHADE OF AMERICA AM FIANA COMING UPA I A GROWN US WHO ARE NOT FRUMBLING AT ALL THEY HAVE A PLAN AND IT INCLUDES COSTUMES VOLCANOES AND A TALKING STICK THAT'S IN A MINUTE FROM CHICAGO PUBLIC RADIO WHEN OUR PROGRAMM CONTINUES IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIFE I'M ACONA JOFFYWALT SITTING IN FOR IRA GLASS TO DAY SHOW THE BIRDS AND THE BEES WE ARE LISTENING IN AS GRWN UPS TRY TO CONVEY THEIR MOST IMPORTANT DEEPLY HOL BELIEFS TO SMALL HUMANS WHO CANNOT YET ZIP UP THEIR OWN JACKETS WE STARTED AT THE BEGINNING WHERE D YOU BABIES COME FROM IN THIS LAST PART OF THE SHOW WHERE N I TALK ABOUT THE END ACT THREE ABOUT THAT FARM UP STATE JONATHAN GOLD STEN HAS THIS LAST STRAY AND A QUICK WARNING LIKE US AT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW THESE ARE STORIES ABOUT GROWN UPS TALKING WITH CHILDREN ABOUT DIFFICULT SUBJECT MATTER SO IF YOU HAVE KIDS WITH YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND LOOK AT HERE'S JONATHAN THERE'S A HOUSE IN SAL LIKE CITY WERE KIDS COME TO HAVE DEATH EXPLAIN TO THEM NOT JUST THAT PEOPLE DIE BUT HOW THEY DIE IT'S CALLED THE SHARING PLACE AND THE FIRST PERSON THEY MEET THERE IS JOMAC FARLING THIS IS HOW SHE EXPLAINS A HEART ATTACK YE ARE A HEART STOPPED TO WORKING AND COULDN'T LIVE YOUR BLOOD THROUGH YOUR BODY SHIS A QUIVERFULL OF KIDSIZED EXPLANATIONS FOR ALL THE WAYS THAT LIFE CAN END LIKE KIDNEY FAILURE YOUR KINNEYS ARE WASHING TMASCHINES FOR YOUR BLOOD AND WHEN YOUR BLOOD THEY STOPP WORKING IN YOUR BLOODS STIRTY THAN ET POISONS YOUR BODY YOU DIE OVERDOSES OVERDOLIS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A SICKNESS IN YOUR BRAIN CALLD THA DICTION AND A DICTION MAKES YOU TAKE MEDICIN THAT'S NOT GOOD FOREELIN YOU TAKE AWAY TOO MUCH OF IT BUT NOT ALL MEDICINES BAD EITHER IVE YOU DO WITH THIT MURDER IT'S WHEN SOMEBODY CHOOSES TO MAKE YOUR BODY STOP WORKING IT'S A CHOICE WE ALSO DO CHOICE AN NOT CHOICE LIKE A MURDER IS A CHOICE CANCER IS NOT A CHOICE WE LSO DO CONTAGIOUS OR NOT CONTAGIOUS THE COU'RE NOT GHEN TO GET MY DEPRESSION AND YOU'RE NOT GEN A GAD MY CANCER THE SHARING PLACE IS A GRIEF SUPPORT CENTR FOR KIDS WHO'VE LOST A FAMILY MEMBER IT'S ONE OF HUNDREDS OF CENTERS LIKE IT AROUND THE COUNTRY KIDS SIT IN SUPPORT GROUPS LED BY GROWN UPS BUT THE POINT IS TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO TALK TO OTHER CHILDREN ABOUT THEIR GRIEF THERE ENCOURAGE TO SPEAK IN CONCRETE LANGUAGE ABOUT DEATH BECAUSE THE THINKING GOES THAT'S HOW TO PROCESS DEATH'S FINALITY SO PEOPLE DON'T PASS AWAY YOU DON'T LOSE THEM THEY DIE WE INVEST SO MUCH EFFORT TRYING TO SHIELD KIDS FROM THE SCARY THINGS IN LIFE WE PLACE ADVISORIES BEFORE CHIEVY SHOWS THAT WARN AGAINST TAN APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE AND SUBJECT MATTER AND WHAT COULD BE LESS APPROPRIATE THAN DEATH SO FOR ALL WE LED ON BUNNIES LAY EGS YOUR MOTHER MEANS WELL AND LIFE PRETTY MUCH GOES ON FOR EVER TO DO OTHERWISE FEELS LIKE YOUR BREAKING A BASIC PACK THAT GROWN UPS HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER O WE E WHO IF YOUR HAVE DI MY DAD AN  I DOG TO CAD AND MY DD THAT'S ALL THE KIDS HEARE A MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT DEATH THAN MOST ADULS ARE LIKE HAYLEY WHO LOST THE SISTER AND BROTHER TO MITO CONDRIAL DISEASE SHE AND HER OTHER BROTHER HAVE THE DISEASE TOO BUT NOT AS BAD THEY'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING THAT MOST OTHER PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD TO LET ALONE OTHER KIDS SO IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT WITH THE KIDS AT SCHOOL SOMETIMES THEY DONTWEN OAL WER TALKING ABOUS CAUSE THE AS E O LIKE ALL THESE WORDS  DA NOBODY'S HEARD LIKE NO O THE OTHER CANS HEARD ABOUT LIKE LI A  NER RLOGICAL ERSIN LIK O LIKE WHAT DOES OT MEAN O LIKE AFEEDING TO WHAT DOES THOT M TIT'S I A REALLY HID TO EXPLAIN IT'S NOT HARD EXPLAINE WITH ITS HARTALIKE  ALL THEM AND THEY STILL DON'T NOT UNDERSTAND WHERE IT GOES OR WHAT IT DOES TO HELP YOU BUT THIS IS A PLACE WHERE KIDS DO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN SEPARATE GROUPS AT THE SHARING PLACE BROKEN DOWN BY AGE THE GROUPS MEET TWICE A MONTH FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF IN A REFERBISHED HOUSE MADE TO FEEL HOMY AND SAFE SO IT'S LIKE VISITING HER GRANDMAS THERE ARE ROOMS WOR KIDS MEET AND TALK AND ROOMS WERE THEIR PARENTS DO THE SAME BUT MOST OF THE ROOMS ARE DEDICATED TO PLAY THERE'S A COSTUME ROOM ER KIDS CAN DRESS UP LIKE POLICE BALERINAS COWBOYS IINSPITE OF ME SO YOU TO DO WHAT EVERY IE TA YOUR O DO AND BESIDE IT IS A ROOM CALLED THE SOFT ROOM WHICH IS FULL OF PROPS AND TOYS INCLUDING AN OLD TELEPHONE ONE LITTLE GIRL WHO WATCHED HER MOTHER OF A HEART ATTACK SPENDS AN ENTIRE PLAYSESSION PRETENDING TO CALL FOR HELP HIGD NINE ONE ONE SHE'D SAY MY GRANDMA'S DYING HURRY COME QUICK THEN SHE'D HANG UP AND DIAL AGAIN HID NINE ONE ONE MY DAD'S DYING HURRY COME QUICK ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR ROOMS AS A PADDED ROOM CALLED THE VOLCANO ROOM ONT YE IT'S FULL OF CUSHIONS AND LARGE RUBBER YEOGOBALLS IT'S EVEN GOT AN AT OLD SIZE DOMING AND WRESTLE AND PUNCH THE KIDS CAN SCREAM YELL POUND THE WALLS AND THROW THINGS ROUND THEY LOVE HER O O A  O IT'S A RELEASE EVE IS NINE YEARS OLD AND HER FATHER DIED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO SHE KNOWS THAT FEELING OF KEEPING IT ALL BOTTLED UP IN SIE SHE SAYS SHE CAN GO DAYS AT SCHOOL LIKE THAT IT KIND OF FEEL THEM REALLY OVERWHELMING AND IT'S LIKE YOU YOU'D LIKE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND ON LE INS IDE IT'S LIKE HURTING SOMEHOW AN LIKE FE O FEELING LIK Y LIKE HURT SOMEHOW WHERE DO WOULD YOU SAY IT HURTS USUALLY WITH MEUD HUR IN TROT AND KIND OF YOU MY STOMACH IT'S LIKE EM SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO COME OUT BUT JUST I REALLY NEEDTA LEARN HOW TO DO THAT I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO IN THIS WORLD WHO CAN GROW UP AND DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO TALK FRANKLY ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS NANCY RYSER IS ONE OF THE COFOUNDERS OF THE SHARING PLACE AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAYS WHEN CHILDREN ASKED HER HOW PEOPLE DIE WELL CLOSE YOUR EYES AND LISTEN AND THERE ISN'T THE NEXT PREATH DOES IT HURT I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK SO THEIR FACE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AT HUR NANCY'S A THERAPIST WHO WORKS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN FOR A LONG TIME THE VERY CONCEPT THAT CHILDREN DO IN FACT GRIEVE WAS HOTLY DISPUTED FROYD SAID THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR CHILDREN TO EVEN CONCEIVE OF SUCH LOSS AND DOES A CULTURE NANCY SAYS THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE IDEA THAT WE OPERATE UNDER OH LOOK SHE'S PLAYING SHE'S O KEY SHE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED WELL SHE'S PLAYING BUT THET HALF AN HOUR LATER SHE'S IN THE HOUSEHOLDING HER TEDDY BARAN SECONG HER THOM AND CRYING SO WE NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT CHILDREN GRIEF AND HOP THEM WHEN THEY GRIEVE SO IT'S NOT STUCK IN SIDED AND COMES OUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP LATER WHEN THEY START TO GET INTIMATE WHE THEY CANNOT BEAR IT AND THEY GO OFF AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY NANCY SAYS CHILDREN JUST GRIEVE DIFFERENTLY THAN ADULFS ESPECIALLY LITTLE CHILDREN THEY GRIEVAN FITS AND STARTS THEY CAN'T FOCASS ON IT FOR VERY LONG AND GRIEF IS MORE PHYSICAL FOR THEM THEL LACKED OUT THEIR ANGER MAYBE KICK A DOOR WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THE VOLCANO ROOM AT THE SHARING PLACE THEY MIGHT ALSO REGRESK SUDDENLY USING BABY TALK OR SUCKING THEIR THUMBS AND IF THEIR POTTY TRAINED THEY MIGHT BECOME UNTRAINED THEY'RE ALSO MAGICAL THINGERS I HEARD STORIES OF KIDS WHO WERE AFRAID TO GO TO SLEEP BECAUSE GRANDMA WENT TO SLEEP AND DIDN'T WAKE UP ONE LITTLE BOY WANDERED AWAY FROM HIS MAM AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM SAYING I'M LOOKING FOR DAD WE LEFT HIM HERE LAST TIME ANOTHER BOY SAID HE JUST WANTED TO DIE FOR A FEW DAYS SWE CAN GO TO HEAVEN AND TEACH HIS LITTLE SISTER HAD A RIGHT A TRICICAL CHILDREN ALSO REGRIEVE THAT IS WITH EVERY NEW STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THEY EXPERIENCE THEIR GRIEF ANEW AND WITH EVERY MILE STONE WHEN THE BRACES COME OFF WHEN THEY GET THEIR DRIVERS LICENSE WHEN THEY GRADUATE THEY'LL INEVITABLY THINK I WISH MY MAM WAS HERE AND GIVEN ALL OF THIS THE THOUGHT BEHIND THE SHARING PLACE ANDOTHER SENTERS LIKE IT IS THAT KIDS CAN HELP ONE ANOTHER IN A WAY THAT ADULTS PERHAPS CAN'T HELP THEM THAT'S WHY THEY'RE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THESE GROUPS IN SHORT KID SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AITURN ON LLEIN  BEFORE THEIR SESSION AT THE SHARING PLACE I SIT DOWN WITH GAVEN WHOS SEXS AND HIS BROTHER ADEN WHO'S ATE THE'RE BOTH DRESSED AND

KNOW EITHER IF I WERE A PARENT I'M NOT SURE I'D WANT MY KID HEARING THAT KIND OF THING AT SCHOOL AND WHILE JILL DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER SHE DOES THINK KIDS BEING ALLOWED TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES IS MUCH

TRIED TO COME THROUGH THE SIDE DOOR CAUSE HA WAS THE DOOR THAT I ALWAYS CAME IN THROUGH  THAT I WAS LIKE I CAN USE THE ADULT ENTRANCE FINALLY HESARAH MOHAMMED HASN'T BEEN TO THE SHARING PLACE FOR A

THEIR LARGER EDUCATION RECKY STEAMBOAT PERSES MOT CHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE AT RESTELVANEOUS THREE AND ITS LARGELY CONSIDERED THE GREATEST RESTLING MATCH OF ALL TIME AN I REALIZE THAT SINCE SOME HOMESCOOLING MY CAD THEY HAD TO SEE THE IMPORTANT CLASSICS OF MY CULTURE THE CANNON THE CANNON YE NOW MAD IT REALLY LIKE WERE JOKING BOAT WERE NOT LIKE CONONICALLY ERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE CANNON WRESTLING WAS NO ONE DISPUTES THIS SPENCH HIS WATCHING WAY FOER GAMES INDER ROCK TOWN SOMETIMES HE SAYS HE SAWT THIS ACTION MIGHT BE BETTER FOR HIM IN SOME WAY TO DABOUT FEWER HOURS DESPORTS MAYBE MAYBE BUT IT ALSO MAKES ME REALIZE THAT THE THINGS IE FILL THEM WITH ARE MUCH BETTER THERE'S A LOT EMPTY THE'S A LIK THERE'S THERE'S A LOT O EMPTY SPACE OUT THERE MAN THERE'S A LOT O EMPTY SFACE IN LIFE AND WHEN SOMEBODY'S SAYS YOU DON'T WELL NOW YOU CAN NAN YOU COULD FILL IT WITH SOMETHING REALLY MEANING FUL WILL YOU OR OR IS THAT EVEN AN OPTION I THINK THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH MEETING YOU CAN PACKIN TO THE HOURS OF A WEEK I THINK THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH PRODUCTIVITY WITHIN ONE PERSON I THINK THAT SOMETHING BY THE WAY THIS IS SFORTS ME TO CONFRONT ANYWAY THE I SAY THESE GUYS REOUT ABOUT SPORTS DOING THESE SPORTSLESS MONTS IT'S CALLED WHAT WORT SPORTS THE TONE OF IT IS LIKE PEOPLEWHO LIVIN TENS SURROUNDED BY REBEL AFTER A WAR REMEMBERING WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN HOUSES LOOKING BACK ON THEIR OLD LIVES WHICH ONLY NOW THEY APPRECIATE FOR WHAT THEY WERE THE AS SAY STARTS THIS WAY I REMEMBER THERE WERE EXPENSIVE COMMERCIALS I DEFNALLY REMEMBER EXPENSIVE COMMERCIALS BEING A PART OF LAT SPORTS I ONLY NOTICE THIS WHEN SPORTS ON REPLAY HAPPEN THE AD FOR REPLAY GAMES OR CHEAP VERY SAD OM GENERATORS CARWARN TO BOOT LIKE TACTGO GER FOR THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T BE TACTACAL LIKE CARBIZERS AND HEARING ANS O YOU REMEMBER HOW BACK WHEN THERE WERE WORDS EACH PERSON HAD A LIST OFTEENS THEY STRONGLY PREFERRED TO WIN LIKE IF THE PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS AND INFAS GRISLY SQUARED OFF YOU AND I WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HACKYER ABOUT LIFE IF THE GR IS LINGS WOR THE TEEM THAT ONE WALL IS THAT ALL ABOUT Y THE THINGS THEY MISS FILLY SPANS DOING THINGS THAT WERE NOT NORMAL FOR ANYBODY BUT PHILLYS FANS SPREADSHEETS OF SPORT STATISTICS FOR EACH GAME WHICH RESULTS THEM WENT INTO A SPREAD CHEET FOR THE WHOLE SEASON WICS THEN WENT INTO A HISTORICAL ARCHIVE SPREAD SHEET WATCHING A FOR OUR GAME AND WALKING AWAY WITH ONE GIFT WORTHY MOMENT THEY WRITE FELLIK AVERSION OF SIPTING FOR GOLD WUTD VERSION IN WHICH THE DIRT ITSELF WAS VALUABLE O UNCLE THING I REMEMBER ABOUT SPORTS IS WATCHING PEOPLE RUN FAST IN ONE DIRECTION IT WAS FUND TO WATCH SOME ONE DO THIS WHEN UNIMPEDED SUCH AS WHEN YOU SAIN BOLT WALKED INTO A MAULL IN CHURCH SHOES OR WHATEVER IN RAIN AS FAST AS THE FAST AS AN A FILL PLAYER EVER HAD BUT IT WAS TEN TIMES THIS FUN WHEN SOME ONE WAS ABLE TO RUN REALLY FAR WHILE OTHER PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO STOP THAT PERSON FROM RUNNING FAR ALSO FON WATCHING BIG PEOPLE TRY TO STOP FAST PEOPLE FROM RUNNING THEY WRITE SPORTS LITAL CHEMISTRY LABS DESIGND TO RUN FOR HOURS MONS AND SENTURIES ALONG THE WAY PRODUCING COUNTLESS THINGS NOBODY COULD AVE PREDICTED FROM THE ONSET A COOL OTHER WORLD WE SPACE PLACS WULD PEOPLE COULD COMPLETELY DEPRESS YOURISE FOR SEVERAL HOURS AND SOMETIMES SO COME TO SPACE MADNESS LONG THE WAY ONE THINGS WENT HAY WIRE DYOU REMEMBER THAT PART A PART WAS LIKE A PALL OF THIRTEEN EC WHEN YOUR TEAM STARTING SAFETY WHENT OUT WITH AN INJURY AND THEY HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY WITH TEND TO FENDERS A WON'E GUI WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOING TO LAW SCHOOL INSTEAD OF COVERING THE OTHER TOS BEST RECEIVER THAT PART WAS A PROBLEM BUT THE FUN ONE O FALL THESE PROBLEMS VERY MUCH BELONG TO SOME ONE ELSE DESPITE US GETTING TO INVEST FEELINGS AND WHETHER THEY SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS OR NOT CARRYING ABOUT WHETHER I MEDIOKR GENERAL MANAGUR COUD FINALLY FIGURE OUT HAT TO  SPORTS PLEDGES THIS WAS KIND OF LIKE POLITICS BUT IN A FAKE WORLD IN WHICH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE POLITICS CAN KILL US THAT WAS NICE IS ALL PASSAGE IN THE ESSAY WHERE SPENSOR REMINISCENCE ABOUT THE LAST LIVE GANE HE WENT TO I'LL LI SEOU AND CLEMSON IN NEW ORLEANS THEY GOT AWYSTERS

BASKIBALL WAS AWAY TO SAY YOU KNOW LIKE IF I COULD USE MY BODY IN THIS WAY THAT U YOU KNOW GOT ME STAIS AN ATTENTION UM AND A CERTAIN AMAUNT OF PRESTIGE THAND THEN THEN MY BODY WAS OCAIN AWAY EVEN THOUGH LIKE IT WAS MEN I WAS WAY TOO SKINNY WHEN I WAS KID EM AND LIKE IT WAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN FOR THE SCHOOLNER COUPLE TIMES AND PLAING BASKIBALL WAS AWAY TO SAY YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT YOU NOT COULD HAVE NERALD TAMAGE FROM BEING MAIL NURSE SHE JUST CAN HAVE THESE OTHER MINER MOLTNERS BRO   ANOTHER GODTHING ABOUT BASKETBALLS TAT SHE MARY BOUGHT THE FAMILY A RIM AND A BASKET BALL FOR THE BACK YARD WHEN SHE WAS ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT USING HER FIRST COMMUNION MONEY SIXTY FIVE BUCKS AND FIVE DOLLAR INCEREMENTS FROM EVERY ONE IN HER HUGE FAMILY THE ONLY EQUIPMENT SHE REALLY NEEDED AND COULD NEVER AFFORD WER GOOD SHOES SHE ALWAYS HAD THOSE SUPERMARKET CHECK OUT LINE SHOES WITH HA HARD PLASTIC SOULS THAT WERE COMPLETELY EMBARRASSING OF COURSE BUT ALSO HAD NO RIPABILITY SO SHE WOULD BE RUNNING DOWN THE COURT AND GO SLIDING AND BE CALLED FOR TRAVELLING SO WHONE YEAR SHE GOT UP THE COURAGE TO ASK A GIRL DOWN THE BLOCK FOR HER OLD CHOES HER NANG WAS CARN AND E SHE HAD REALLY NICE BATE A BULLETS TIG TOPS WHITE AND UM I WANTED HER SNEAKERS AND CAUSE I KNEW SHE WAS GETTING NEW ONES AND UM IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE IS THE PRACTICE OF THROWING YOUR OLD SNEAKERS UP OVER THE TELEPHONE WIRES WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THEM UM AND MOST OF THEM WERE HARDLY WORN OUT AT ALL I MEAN NOT IT THE MEAN THEY THOUGHT OF THEM YOU COULD SEE T HAT THERE WAS TREAD MISSING BUT LIKE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAD RIPPED THROUGH THE TOP OF THEM UM AND IH'D ASKED HER FOR THEM AND SHE SAID DEA THAT SHE WOULD GIVEN TO ME WHEN SHE GOT HER NEW ONES AND M AND IT WAS LIKE I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT WERD THAT I WOULD ASK SOMEBODY FOR THEIR UE SHOES BUT WE HAD OTHER CLOTHES THAT WERE USED FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW SHE WAS TOUGH AND SHE CAT KN HAD THIS LIKE YOU KNOW SHE SEEMED LIKE SHE BE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT COULD LIKE KEEP SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HER AND AND WOULD KNOW WHAT IT MEANT AN  AND SHE DID SHE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY EXCEPT OF COURSE THE MOST IM PORTANT PERSON THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HER MOTHER AND HER MOTHER GOT M REALLY UPSET AND TOLD HER THAT SHE COULDN'T GIVEN TO ME AND THERE THEY WERE HANGING UP ON THE TELEPHONE WIRE MY SNEAKERS AND IAM SURE THAT HER MUM DID THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID THAT IF I CAME HOME WITH THE PAIR U SNEAKERS THAT IT WOULD BE IN SULTING TO MY MOTHER I'M SURE THAT THEY ALL HAD THIS UNDERSTANDING UP THEMSELVES LIKE YOU NOW YOU DON'T INSLT SOME ONE ELSE'S YOU DON'T INSULT ONE OF YOUR PEERS BY GIVING THEIR KIDS HERE CRAPPY SHOES EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE BETTER THAN THE CRAPPY SHOES THAT YOU BROUGHT FOR THEM YOU KNOW BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS LIKE REALLY BEAUTIFUL SNEAKER SANG UP ON THE ONERS AND HER WS NO WAY TO GET THEM NO WAY AT ALL THEY JUST LIKE FLOATED UP THERE AND YOU KNOW HON I THINK THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED THAT EM PLATONIC IDEALISM WAS TRUE THERE REALLY WAS A PERFECT THING TI EVER EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ALL I PLAYED IN THAT CATHOLIC LEAGUE AND ONLY I COULD SEE THEM FOR WHAT THEY WERE THEY ONLY SA WORN OUT TREAD I SAW A SEASON OF UNFORESEENS HIGH STATISTICS    WE TOLKD FOR TWO HOURS ABOUT BASKET BALL AND WE KEPT RETURNING TO THE DUNK AND THE CRUELTY OF THE DUNK ON THAT WOULD SLICED TROPHY I DUNK BY A STICK FIGURE MADE OUT NAILS DRIVING HOME THERE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SENSE OF FRUSTRATION THEY COULD BE THE BEST BALL HANDLERS THE BEST GARDS AND IT DIDN'T MATTER WORTH A DAM BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T DUNK ALL OF THAT CAPTURED FOR EVER IN THE LAST TROPHY MOST OF THEM WOULD EVER RECEIVE I THINK IT WAS REALLY KIND OF ETHOUGHTLESS AND THE WAY THAT LIKE THOUGHTLESS THINGS CAN SOMETIMES T HAVE A REALLY NASTY EDGE TO THEM YOU KNOW LIKE NO ONE AND WE HAD A WOMAN ON OUR TEAM WHO WAS LIKE SIX THREE AND SHE COULDN'T DUNK THE BALL YOU DON'T MEAN IT WAS LIKE THERE WAS NO THERE WAS NO ONE THAT WE KNEW WHO COULD DUNK THE BALL NOT NOT A SINGLE WOMAN THAT WE KNEW AND WE KNEW SOME TALL WOMEN WE KNEW WOMEN WHO WERE IN COLLEGE YOU KNOW I MEAN WE'S THAT I HAVE A DREAM I RECURRING DREAM THAT I DUNT THE BALL E WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS ON THE BASE LINE I I I MADE IT WAS THE SAME I WAS IN THE SAME POSITIONA A TIME AND IT WASN'T LIKE THE KINDS OF DUNKS THAT YOU SEEIN REAL LIFE LIKE THAT UM EVEN THE BEST PLAYERS CDO THIS WAS A SPECTACULAR

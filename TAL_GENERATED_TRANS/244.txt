BLOOD IS METAPHOR BLOOD IS THE ACTUAL STAFF MOVING THROUGH OUR VEINS WE ARRIVED AT AT THROUGH  OCHEU AT THREE STAGE RIGHT SO THIS IS CONDITION IT'S CALLED VEZO VAGEL SINKAPY IS PASICALLY FAINTING IN RE ACTION TO CERTAIN STIMULI STRIGERED BY ALL KINDS OFTHINGS EXPOSURE HEAT STRESS AND THE SIDE OF BLOOD I TURNS OUT THAT THE BLOOD HE DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO BE REAL BLOOD TO GET THAT RESPONSE ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS BEEN OUT OF WUNME REMEMBERS ONE BLOODY SHAKESPEARE PRODUCTION THAT AT ITS HEIGHT HAD SCORES OF PEOPLE FAINTING NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HERE'S BEEN I CAN SEE THOUSAND IN SAKES I WAS A YEAR OUT OF YOUNIVERSITY TRYING VERY HAUNT TO BE AWRITEA AND WORKING AT A BOOKSHELP IN CENTURAL LONDON I WAS ALSO ALMOST ALWAYSBURG SO BRK IN FACT THAT I DON'T THINK I COULD AFFOLD MORE THAN ONE VISIT TO SEE A WESTEN SHOW THE ENTIRE YEAR WHAT I DID DO A LULZE OF THE WAS A READE THEATER REVIEWS TWO THOUSAND IN SAKES WAS THE YEAR OF MICHAEL SHEEN AND FRANKLANGELLA IN FROS NIXON IT WAS HA YEAR AVENUE CUE CAME TO THE WEST EN THE YEAR OF WICKED'S LONDON DABEW AND ALL I COULD DO WAS DREAM OF GOING TO SEE THEM SO NATURALLY THE REVIEW PAGE WAS THE FIRST PLACE I READ ABOUT A PLAY THATE WAS GETTING RAY REVIEWS THATE WAS APPARENTLY SO GRISLY SO BLOODY AUDIENCE MEMBERS WERE FAINTING THE PLAY WAS ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S LEAST LOVED PLAYS TIGHTUS ANGERONICAS THREE HOURS OF MUSCULAR BLOODY THEATR THAT AS ONE AUDIENCE MEMBER QUOTED IN THE PAPER PUT IT HAD PEOPLE DROPPING LIKE FLIES IT WAS THRILLED AT THE IDEA OF THEATER  BEING POWERFUL ENOUGH TO FELL EVEN STURDY LONDON THEATERGOERS I WAS JEALOUS I WANTED TO GO I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD WITHSTAND IT IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THAT PRODUCTION'S POWER ABOUT THE BLOOD AND TEY AT WONT WHAT WE HAD FORTY THREE PEOPLE ONCE O FORTY THREE PEOPLE FANTED FORTY THREE THAT WAS OUR LAX ALL THESE YEARS LATER I WAS THRILLED TO TALK TO THE DIRECTOR LUCY BAILEY BECAUSE I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW SHE DONE SOMETHING SO EXTRAORDINARY ONCE I CAME ATS THE AUDITORIA LAND THE USHESA AALL A SCHOOL GIRLS CAME AND THEY ALL FAINTED AND THEE ALL IN THIS BOX WE PUT THEM ALL UP THERE ILOO TO THE OU NO ALWAYS THE VERY PALE GARS ALL CITY  IG I FAINTED  LL TAKEN OUT I SURSAYE THE USHERS WHEN I CAME A SE SHOTER AND AND HOW MANY PEOPLE TO DAY  JUST TO BE CLEAR NO ONE FELL AND HIT THEIR HEAD OR GOT SERIOUSLY INJURED THEY WERE SIMPLY OVERWHELMED LUCY JUST HADN'T FORESEEN THE FAINTING TO GIVE YOU A PICTURE THE GLOBE IS AN OPEN AIR THEATRE A MOSTLY FAITHFUL RECREATION OF SHAKESPEARE'S ORIGINAL WHICH IS UNDER HALF OF ITS AUDIENCE STANDING CLOSE TO THE ACTION ON THE STAGE AND THE GLOBYES USED TO FAINTERS COMBINATION OF STANDING AND THE SUN PROBABLY DURING TITERS WHEN A PERSON FAINTED THE USHERS WOULD WINE THROUGH THE CROWD WITH AN UNFOLDED WILCHER AND THEN TAKE THEM OUT OF THE ARENA LATER IN THE RUN TERE WAS A SAINT JOHN'S AMBULANCE PARK NEAR BY IT'S NOT SURPRISING  THE BLOOD IN CONTACTST AND INQUANTITY IS INESCAPABLE AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE TITA SANTERONICAS IS ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S EARLIEST PLAYS AND THER'S A LOT OF YOUNG MAN'S SWAGGER MIXED IN WITH THE POETRY OF THE WRITING SET IN ANCIENT ROME THE PLAY WAS WRITTEN TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE FASCINATIONS OF THE ELIZABETHAN ERA IT'S ABOUT WAR AND REVENGE AND AN OVER THE TOP GRIEF THAT CLOUDS GOOD SENSE AND MODERATION INNOCENCE GET SLAN BRUTES REVEL IN THEIR SAVAGERY BLOOD IS SHED IN REALLY HORRIBLE WAYS RICHAL SACRIFICE SLIT THROATS MUTILATIONS SEXUAL ASSAULT PLOSSA MEMORABLE CANNIBALISTIC PIE IT'S TA PLAY THATS TRENCHED IN BLOOD AND IT OFTEN GETS WRITTEN OFF AS A FLURRY OF UNSUBSTANTIAL BLOOD LETTINGS BECAUSE OF THAT TBUE LUCY KNEW THE BLOOD MATTED TO THE PLAY ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS SHE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WAS HAD TO MAKE THE BLOOD LOOK REAL IN AN IRONIC TWIST TO MAKE THE BLOOD LOOK LIKE THE REAL THING THEY HAD TO FAKE IT IF YOU SEE A LOT OF STAGE BLOOD IT IT OFTEN DOESN'T FEEL VERY REALL EVEN IF IT'S QUITE ACCURATE THE COLOR OF BLOOD BUT BLOOD IS QUITE RIGHT AND SOMEHOW THAT BRIGHT BLOOD IN IN THEATR TORMS MAKES SO GO O YEA YER THAT'S JUST SUCH A SEA TOR BLOOD WA SAID  LOOK HOW WE WOULD MAKE IT UNREAL IN ORDER TO MAKE IT OR REAL AND OTHER WOS WE GARCLD THE BLOOD LUCY ALSO HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THE BLOOD MOVE SO IT WOULD DELIVER THE MOST IMPACT SO SHE TURNED TO ANOTHER EXPERD THE FIGHT DIRECTOR YOU TALK TO HERE ABOUT IF YOUR WOUNDED IN THIS WAY HOWDES ABLOT THE HAVE THUS WERE TOES THE BLOOD HAR WHYS IT COMING OUT O THE CALLOF TEBAUS WHY IS IT CARIA THOSE WHAT'S WHAT'S A JEARNEY IF THE BLOOD FOR TAMERA WHO THE AUDIENCE LOVE TO HAYS THERE'S A VERY CAREFUL SPURT OF BLOOD WHEN SHE GETS A GIANT FORK IN THE GLOODS TWHEN TIGHTUS LOSES A HAND THETE WAS MORE THAN ONE SOURCE OF BLOOD A SPURT FROM A SYRINGE ND THEN A SLOWER OOZE OUT OF HIS ARM TO MAKE THE INTENSE EXPERIENCE MORE IMMERCIVE LUCY AND HER DESIGNER BUILD DUDLEY FOCUSED ON THE SPACE ITSELF THEY WANTED TO MAKE IT FEEL OPPRESSIVE MAKE THE AUDIENCE PARTI IPATE IN THE BLOOD SPORT THE ACHIEVE THIS BY GIVING THE GLOBE A TEMPORARY VALARIUM ROOF WHICH REDUCED THE SUNLIGHT AND CREATED SHADOWS AND THEN THEY FEEL TO THE SPACE WITH INCENSE THEY MOVES SOME OF THE ACTION OFF THE STAGE AND INTO THE CROWD TO CREATE A SORT OF THEATRE OF CHANCE THE IDEA WAS TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A TEMPLE OF DEATH THEY HAVE TO STRIKE A DELICATE BALANCE TOO LITTLE BLOOD AN ATMOSPHERE AND YOU DON'T BRING THE AUDIENCE ALONG TOO MUCH AND IT FEELS LIKE A PARADY YET IK A HUGE CONTRACT AS YET BETWEEN THE AUDIENCE ANS HE PLAY AND THE PLAYERS THAT THE AUDIENCE GIVEN ANY CHARTS WANT TO BELIEVE SO AS LONG AS YOU DO EVERYTHING TO SUSPEND THERE THEIR DISBELIEF THEN YOU YOU YO YOU KEEP THAT CONTRACT BUT AS SOON AS YOU BREAK THAT CONTRACT AND DO SOMETHING THAT SHOWS THEM WENE THE CANIC OR OVERACTS OVERPLAYS YOUR CARDS OVEREGGSIT TOO MUCH BLOOD OR OR UNGI SIT TO LITTLE BLOOD AT THE MOMENT WHERE THEY GOIN SORRY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AND ONE OF THE PLACES THEY DECIDED TO UNDER PLAY HAPPENS IN THE VERY FIRST BLOOD LETTING IN THE PLAY WHEN TITERS SACRIFICES ALARBUS IT HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY WIT HOW WE DID IT WE CHO AND IT WAR SO FAST AND THEN THEY SAW THAT A THE BLOOD AND THEY THEN THEN WETE PUDDING HIM THEY DON'T HAVE TILE TO DWELL SO HE DID A VERY DELIBERATE SAIL WE REALLY WAS SHOCKING WITH IT THE AUDIENCE SEES A FLASH OF RED AND THEN HE'S GONE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MAYBE THE BLOOD MADE THEM FAINT BUT IT WASN'T JUST THE FACT OF IT THAT CAUSE THEM TO FALL IT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN THE PEOPLE ON STAGE THE FEELINGS THEY WERE EXPERIENCING ONE OF THE MOST SHATTERING MOMENCE IN THE PLAY COMES AFTER LEVINEAR ATTACKED AND MUTILATED IS BROUGHT TO HER FATHER AND UNRAPET THE DARK VISCERS BLOOD SEEPS THROUGH THE BANDAGES AT HER STUMPS AND PAUSE SLOWLY FROM HER MOUTH HEVEN TITERS A WARHARDAND GENERAL WHOSE DON HIS OWN SHARE OF KILLING IS REDUCED IN THAT MOMENT TO AN ANGUISHED AND HELPLESS FATHER HIS PRECIOUS DAUGHTERS STILL BLEEDS AND HE CAN'T STOP THAT THAT BLEEDING TO HAVE YOUR LIVE'S BLOOD BLEED OR YOUR KILL OR THE BLOOD THAT IS YOUR BLOD AND TO SEE IT BLEEDING ANTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE WULDS WERE AMAY IS IS PUSCHIOUS THE BRAYN TO PUINT OR LADNESS AS TITERS HIMSELF SAYS IN THAT SCENE IT WAS MY DEAR AND HE THAT WOUNDED HER HAVE HURT ME MORE THAN HAD HE KILLED ME DEAD THETS O O A GIRL WHO STILL ALIVE BUT BLEEDING AND THAT AN CAUSES SO MUCH INTERNAL BLEEDING TO HER FATHER BOTH O THE HEART AND  THE BRAY SO IN A WAY HE SUFFERS A KING O BRAY AN BLEED THE ENTIRE PLAY IS TIH TOGETHER BY THAT RIBBON OF GRIEF PARECE LOSE CHILDREN BROTHERS TURN ON EACH OTHER INNOCENT BYSTANDERS ARE COLLATERAL DAMAGE AND ALL THE BLOOD IS IN THE SERVICE OF THAT RURE FEELING THE LANGUAGE IS HYSTERICAL AND VIOLENT AND IT GOES ON FOR FIVE LONG ACTS THE AUDIENCE GETS PULLED INTO THE HYSTERIA BECAUSE THEY HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BY THE HALF WAY POINT INACT THREE THEYE SO FAR GONE THAT THEY DROP AT THE IDEA OR VIOLENCE WE USE TO HAVE PEOPLE FAINTING ON A WORD SO WHENEER CAMAN SAID THAT HE WANTED WANT OF THEM TO CHOP OFF THEY HAD YOU COULD ALWAYST GUARANTEES TAT SOMEBODY WOULD FAINT WHEN HE SAID CHOP WHEN ERRAND SAYS THE WORD HERE TDHERES NO ACTUAL CHOPPING HAPPENING HE'S JUST SAYING IT BUT IT WAS ENOUGH YOU COUL SEE THE AUDIENCE STO THE GIRD THEMSELVES AND THEN HE SAY CHOP AND ONE SOMBODY WOULD GO ONE OF THE THINGS IE IS C URIOUS TO TOK TO LUCY ABOUT WAS HOW WIT FELT TO BE THE ARCHITECT OF ALL THIS FEELING WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO DO THIS TO AN AUDIENCE AGAIN AND AGAIN HAVE TO BE HONIST WAS COMPLETELY FILLING  WE WE HAVE NOT EXPECTEDS THES RESPONSE OR JIS TEND NOT TO BE VOCAL SO THIS KIND OF FAINTING WAS A SORT OF SIGN OF AUDIENCE INVOLLS THEM TESTING I THINK THE WHOLE EFFECT TO SEE THE ASTONISHING EFFECT O HAD ON PEOPLE TO THE EXTENT HF PEOPLE WAS SICK THEY FAINTED THAT EVEN UMINATED THET LOST CONTROL OF THE THE WHOLE BODY WAS TO DO IT THIS CUMULATIVE FEELING COMBINATION OS THINS WOT JUST ONE THING IT WAS SUCH A I FORMATION THAT SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLAY WAS WORTHING EIGHT YEARS AFTER THAT THIST PRODUCTION AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN LUCY REVIVE TITAS ANDRONICUS AT THE GLOBE IT WAS A DIFFERENT COST AND ONCE AGAIN AUDIENCES FLOCKS TO SEE THIS DIFFICULT BLOODY PLAY THIS TIME THET THE ORDIERS DIDN'T FAINT AS MUCH I MEAN THEY REALLY DIDN'T AND YET EVERYTHING WE DID WAS I THINK PALPABLY THE SAME IF NOT BETTER E AND I THINK THAT WAS BECAUSE PEOPLE CAME PSYCHOLOGICALLY PREPARED SO IT WAS VERY MUCH HARDER TO GET THAT THAT THA CONTRACTS GOING THAT YOUR SO INVOLVED O S SEE YOUAREGOING TO FACE MOTEN THEATRE IS MOSTLY A QUIET AFFAIR

THE WAY IN REAL LIFE DECIDED HAVER FIWOOD REMOVE  YOU DOING FIN I FIVE UN BREAK MY HEART SO FOR OUR LASTER ABOUT BLOOD TO DAY WE GO RIGHT TO THE SOURCE THE MACHINE THAT KEEPS BLOOD PUMPING AND FLOWING INSIDE OF US AND TO SOMEBODY USTROBAT ISTIMATURE THAT MACHINE WORKS WELL PRODUCER JOHN CALL TALK TO THIS MAN AND ALSO WATCHED IM WORK  WONNING  IF YOU ARE SQUEEMISH ABOUT HE WAS INSIDES THE STOY HAS A LOT OF THAT MY FAVORITE FUN FACT ABOUT BLOOD IS THAT IT HAS A PROTENIN IT THAT'S ALSO FOUND IN EGGS ALBYMEN SOMETHING ABOUT THAT JUST STRIKES ME AS POETIC THE COMPLEX MACHINE OF THE HUMAN BODY AND A THING IT EATS FOR BREAKFAST SHARING THE SAME INGREDIENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS FACT FROM THE HEART SURGEON DOCTOR JOHN ELEFTERIOTIS OR DOCTOR E ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO I DROVE UP TO YALE NEWHAVAN HOSPITAL AND TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT THIS ONE TECHNIQY EMPLOYS TALL DEEP HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST A K A THE DEEP FREEZE OFTEN HE HAS TO DO SUCH RADICAL PLUMMING WORK ON THE HEART AND ITS ARDERIES THAT HIS TEEM COOLS THE PATIENT'S BODY DOWN TO SIXTY FOUR DEGREES FAIRIN HEIGHT AND THEN WARMS THEM BACK UP AGAIN AFTERWARDS HE COMPARES IT IN ONE WAY TO MAKING EGG LEMON SOUP YOU DON'T WANT THE EGG TO CURDLE AND AT CURDLES WHEN THE COOK IS IN A HURRY IT HAS TO SIMMER AT A VERY LOW LEVEL IN ORDER NOT TO CURDLE WELL THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE ALBIOMAN IN THE EGG AND THE BLOODSTREAM IS FULL OF ALBIUMEN SO THAT IF WE WARM TOO FAST WE'LL BASICALLY YET SCRAMBLED EGGS N THE BLOODSTRIN SO GROS THAT'S CATESTRAPIC SO WARMING TAKES ONE HOUR WE HAVE TO WARM VERY SLOWLY THAT'S LONG AS AR HEETING BET IS NO MORE THAN TEN DECREES WARMER THAN THE BLOOD THE BLOOD WALL CURDLE WE WALL CATC SCRAMBLED EGGS DOCTOR ES AN EXPERT ON THE STEEP FREES METHOD HE'S BEEN DESCRIBED IS ONE OF THE BEST DOCTORS IN THE COUNTRY A GIANT OF CARDIO THORASIC SURGERY WHEN WE MET IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HE'D BEEN AT YALE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AND IN ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND OPEN HARD OPERATIONS OT THAT POINT WHO MAY BE THREE HUNDRED TRANSPLANTS HE DRAMATICALLY LENGTH IN THE LIVES OF THE JAS MUSICIAN DAY BRUWBECK AND THE WRITER ROBERT LUDLUM FOR LONG TIME HE DID ONE MAJOR OPERATIEN AND THEN MAY BE ONE SMALLER PROCEDOR ALMOST EVERY WEEK DAY HE OFFERED TO LET ME WATCH HIM PERFORM THE DEEP FREES SO WATCH HIM TAKE A PATIENT AND LITERALLY SUSPEND THEIR ANIMATION IT'S WHAT COOLING THEM DOWN DOES THERE NOT DEAD BUT THEY SHOW NO SIGNS OF LIFE ANY MARK SO THAT HE COULD REACH HINTO THEIR BODY DIS CONNECT TE GRUCHAL ORGAN AND FIX IT WITH HIS HANDS IT'S LIKE HE'S A M ASTER ILLUSIONIST FOOLING DEATH WITH THIS HIGHSTAKES VERSION OF MISDIRECTION I WAS LIKE YA GIIMEN I WAS THINKING WHAT WE WE A THE SOUNDEWE OPEN IN A BREASTBON WI I E A INTERESTING FOR ITHE PROCEDURE I OBSERVED WAS A THREE HOUR AORDIC GRAFT AND VALVE REPLACEMENT ITSTRETCHD I GOT TO THE OR EARLY ABOUT SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING ON A THIRSDAY ALL GOWNED UP WITH A MASK AND SCRUB HAT THE TEAM WAS ALREADY CREPPING THE PATIENT FOR SEDATION DOCTOR E AND I STOOD SEVERAL YARDS AWAY IN THE CORNER SO HE COULD GO OVER THE CASE WITH MAT THE PATIENT HAD AN AORDIC ANURISEN YEU MAY KNOW I DIDN'T THE AORD IS THE LARGEST ARGERY IN THE BODY AND SHAPED LIKE A CANDYCANE CHES AN ANURISM JUST MEANS THE PART OF IT WITH A CURVED PART AT THE TOP IN THIS CASE HAD BECOME SWOLLEN IT STRETCHED LIKE A BALLOON FILLING WITH AIR IT SO THE WALL OF IT WAS TOOTHIN EUNLIKE MANY OTHER DISEASES DOES NOT HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS UNTI IT RUPTUROUS A FIRST SYMPTOM AS USUALLY RUPTURE OR DEATH TT TAT SEEMS LIKE ITS MORE THAN A SYMPTON YES IT'S LIKE IT TA CONCLUSION O ETS A CONCLUSION  THAT'S FOR WALL STATE OF YET THE PATIENT WAS STILL AWAKE AT THIS POINT EYES WIDE OPEN LISTENING TO ONE OF THE ANASTESEOLOGIST HE HAD A BROWN MUSTACHE AND A BURGAT LOOKED NERVOUS LEANING TOWARD AFRAID BITHIN MINUTES HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND THEY WERE PAINTING HIS NAKED BODY ALL OVER WITH AN IODINE BASE HAPED HIS EYES SHUT THEN THEY SWADDLED HIM COMPLETELY IN PLACTIC AND BLUE SURGICAL SHEETS WHICH MADE THE WHOLE THING FEEL MUCH MORE IMPERSONAL DOCTOR E SEEMS TO CARE A LOT ABOUT HIS PATIENTS BUT THIS IS WHEN I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND HOW AUTUMOTIVE HIS WORK IS MANAGING THE PROPER FUNCTION OF THIS MOTOR WITH ITS VALVES AND CHAMBERS AND SPARKS PROPELLING A PERSON'S BLOOD FINALLY THEY MADE THE FIRST INCISION NER OPENING HIM UP EYEES OPENING A CENERAL ARDERY DOWN I TE AOVUS L LET AN DUCTOR HE WAS RIGHT THE SOUND OF THEM SAWING OPEN THE BREASTBONE WAS I GUESS WE CAN GO WITH ELARI THEN THEY INSERTED THE CHEST SEPARATOR SLIKE A REVERSE VICE INSTEAD OF SQUEEZING THINGS TOGETHER IT SPREADS THEM APART WHILE I WATCHED ON A WALMONIDER THE CIRCULATING NURSE PADY LAPHOND CAME OVER AND EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THEY WERE SLICING OPEN THE PARA CARTIUM WIT AS KIND OF PROTECTIVE SACK AROUND THE HEART AND YOU KNOW IT CAME AT THAT EXTRABIT OF PACKAGIN AND IS THAT IS THAT THE LIVER NO THAT BIG AR THAT'S THE LONG WILE ALMOS TET EXPANA IN CONTRACTI WITH BRETH SHE WAS RIGHT I WATCHD THE LUNGS EXSPAND AND CONTRACT WITH THIS PLACID RHYTHM THAT MADE ME THINK OF OCION WAVES ROLLING IN AND OUT IT WAS EARTHLY AND IT WAS FAMILIAR AND THEN THINGS GET A LOT MORE INTENSE OWE CRET OWE OLWY LOKS E BLOY TITING TISSUE CUTTING TISSUE A EN   A SORT OF A CUSHING ALUNG TO THE LET O O I BROKEN TRUE TU THE HEART WHICH IS PEETING IT SORT O JUMPING LIKE A FISH AND  HIS CHEST LIKE AN ANGRY FISH TRYING VIOLENTLY TO ESCAPE BUT EVEN THAT'S TOO TERRESTRIAL A DESCRIPTION FOR WHAT THIS LOOKED LIKE IT LOOKED ALIEN LIKE A CREATURE AN A SIPHI MOVY WITH NO FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIP TO HUMANITY IT WAS STARTLING ALMOST FRIGHTENING AND I WILL NEVER FORGET IT TO THINK THAT SAME THING E SENTIULATE I'S ALSO IN SIGHT OF ME AND DOCTOR E AND ALL OF YOU AND EVERYONE BUT WHEN YOU SEE IT BE THINK THAT THING IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED JUST THEN DOCTOR E ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO COME UP TOP YES AN AND ON TO THE STOOL JUST BEHIND THE BLUE DRAPE THAT SEPARATES THE STERIL AREA WHERE THEY WERE OPERATING FROM THE REST OF THE RHEN SO I WAS STANDING ALMOST EXACTLY ABOVE THE PATIENT'S BODY LOOKING DOWN INTO IT AND BEING THAT CLOSE THIS FELLOG I WAS LOOKING AT SOMETHING SO FUNDAMENTAL AN ANCIENT AND I FELT LIKE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING IRREGULAR SMUCK LIKE ME IS SUPPOSED TO SEE LIKE IF YOUR GOTS ARE EXPOSED AND I'M THERE IT USUALLY MEANS SOMETHING'S GONE REALLY WRONG TAN REALIZE THAT HEARTS WERE SO BIG O HER I TRY TO CONVEY IN THE DIFFERENT RIGTINS FOR THE GENERAL PUBBLIC AS THE BEAUTY  THE BOD THE ONTRUL HO YOR THE BD I JUST TAK FY BREATH O WAY EVERY SINGLE TA MONY I DON'T THINK IDE IS TO SIRST WORD I WOULD A SHOT A IN TA A THIS IS NOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL A THEY HOOK THE PATIENT UP TO SOMETHING CALLED THE HEART LUNG MACHINE THE BIG PART OF THESE PROCEEDURES IS OUTSOURCING THE WORK OF THE HEART IN THE LUNGS TO THIS BIG BOXY KIND OF ROBOD WITH ROTATING DRUMS IN IT THIS IS HOW THY PULL OFF THE GRAIN ILLUSION TRICKING THE BODY INTO OPERATING WITHOUT THE HEART THEY SEND THE PATIENT'S BLOOD TO THE MACHINE IT OXYGEN NATES AND PRESSURIZES THE BLOOD AND LSO COOLS IT AND THEN SENDS A BACK TO THE KIDNEYS AND THE LIVER AND THE LUNGS ALL THE ORGANS AND YOU CONCEE  WE MA PICULA SE A O FALL FUBBLES EC BUBBLES E CAS A STRO RUBBLES FROM THE BLOOD YET BUBBLE O ERE AND THE BLOOD WE RE MOVE OM ALL VERY CAREFUL ARE YOU SEE NOW ON AT THE HEART IS COLLAPSED BE CARSE WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE BLOOD OUT DOCTOR ET CLAMPS OFF THE AORDE OF RIGHT ABOVE THE AN YOURITS OF YOU'RE A TRA THAT TAKES THE HEART OUT OF THE CIRCUET THEY ALSO SEND A SUPER COLD ER PARALIZING FLUID TO I T CALLED RETRO BRAD FOR RETRO FOR SHORT SO THE HEART ISN'T EVEN TRYING TO CONTRACT ANY MORE NOW THE PATIENTS VITAL SIGNS OF AMOST TOTALLY SEIZED NO PULSE OF COURSE BECAUSE HIS HEART ISN'T BEATING VERY LITTLE BRAIN ACTIVITY BUT LOOKS LIKE THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT ISN'T AS BAT OFF AS OTHERSE SO THEY DON'T END UP HAVING TO COOL THEM ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SIXTY FOUR DEGREES WHEN THEY DO THAT IT MEANS ZERO BRAIN ACTIVITY NO SIGNS OF LIFE WHATSOEVER AND WHEN THE PATIENTS THAT COLD THEY ACTUALLY TURN OFF THE HEART LUNG MACHINE WHICH MEANS NO BLOOD FLOAT TO THE BRAIN SO NO OXYGEN UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS IT'S A RACE AGAINST TIME THEY HAVE FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR TO OPERATE EFOR THE BRAIN STARTS TO DIE MEANWHILE THIS PATIENT'S HEART IT HAS BEEN BEATING FOR MORE THAN SIXTY TWO YEARS ANC BEFORE HE WAS BORN IS STILL MOST OF US WHEN OUR HEART STOP IT'LL MEAN THEIRE NEVER GOING TO START AGAIN AND THAT 'LL HAPEN TO THIS GY EVENTUALLY TOO OF COURSE BUT THIS IST JUST A TIME OUT FOR THE HEART A BREAK LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS A MINY VACATION AFTER A LIFETIME OF CONSTANT LABOR IN THE PUMP HOUSE  OS OPENI THEEORDER YOU'RE LOOKING INSIDE SHO AV YOU CONSEIVE TA CAVERNOUS THIMENSIONS ARE VARY ORDER THERE WE COULD GIVE IT A ZIPOT NOW THEY SET ABOUT THE ACTUAL MECHANICAL WORK THERE IN THEIR DEDO FIRST THEY REPLACED THE AORTIC VOWVE IS ALL CALSIFY  AND THEN THEY SWOP OUT THE ULGY PART OF THE AORDA WITH THE SYNTHETIC TUBE AND AFTER ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS THEY'RE RETTY MU DONE AND IT'S TIME TO BRING THE PATIENT BACK TO LIFE DOCTOR E CALLS FOR THE OFFICIAL D ARRING MANEUVERS THAT IS EVACUATING ANY EXCESS AIR OUT OF THE HEART BEFORE THEY LET IT FILL BACK UP AGAIN WITH LOD AND SUDDENLY IT'S LIKE HES A MOVY DIRECTOR ON SET COMPLETE WITH LOTS OF INDUSTRY TERMS I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO LET A LITTLE BLOOD FLO THROUG THE HEART RUN FOM RETRO FOR DEARING AND WILL TAKE A HAF TA N A STASA VALSALVAS ARE DEEP BREATHS THE ANASTESEOLOGIST CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL THE MOTION OF THE PATIENT'S LUNGS NEXT  DOCTOR E NEENS TO UN CLAMPTHE AWARDA TO PUT THE HEART BACK IN THE CIRCUIT LO FLO FOR THE CLAMP WE ARE A RAK ANK BACK UP SLO WE ASAE DOWN RETRO OF ALL THE FLO TO YOU RED ON GREEN ARN WARMHALEWAY RETRO AGAIN AS THAT PARALYZING FLUID SO THEY TURNE OUT OFF RED AND GREEN ARE BOTH DRAINATE TUBES LESS US WET COLOUR THEY ARE AND WARM ALL THE WAY MEANS BACK TO THE WORLD OF NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX DEGREES NO SCRAMBLED ALPINEN ANOTHE HART O STARTIN TE IT AV A SFE OT OVATION AT THIS POINT THE PATIENT'S HEART THE VIOLENT THING I WAS SO AFRAID OF IN THE BEGINNING IS MUCH MORE DOCILE WHIT'S MORE LIKE A BIG CHICKEN BREAST TO ME NOW DOCTOR E SAYS THA PROBABLY MEANS I'M GETTING HUNGRY WHICH I WAS I'M NOT SOME ONE WHO TENDS TO SEEK OUT INTENSE EXPERIENCE SAS NOT REALLY ADVENTUROUS I DON DREAM ABOUT TRAVELLING THE FARAWAY PLACEAS BUT LOOKING INSIDE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING LIKE THAT WATCHING A

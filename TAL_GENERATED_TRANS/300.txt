SOMETIMES DOES WHEN HE GETS AN IDEA AN HIS HENT TO ME IT WAS JUST A VERY CLEAR YOU KNOW FLARE FIRE  LIKE IF HE WAS TRYING TO TURN ME AWAY FROM THI STORY IT WAS JUST IT WAS LIKE HE HAD JUST FILLED MY TANCOP IT WAS LIKE YOU IT WAS LIKE E PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THIS THIS IS CRAZY IT IS CRAZY THE STUFF KIRK FOUND OUT I CAN'T TURN AWAY ONCE YOU STORT HEARING ALL THE DT TAILS NOT JUST ABOUT THE HIGHEST AND REST BUT WHERE THE BIRDS CAME FROM AND THE WHOLE SEREAL SUB CULTURE OF SAMON FLYTYING WHAT KIRK CALLS THE FEATHER UNDERGROUT SOMETIMES CHARACTERIZED BY SHADY DEALINGS AND OBSESSION KIRK INTERVIEWED MORE THAN FIFTY FLY TIRES AND DISCOVERED THINGS THAT THET PEOPLE INVESTIGATING THE CASE DIDN'T FIND OUT AND THAT IS OUR SHOW TO DAY THE STORY OF WHAT MAY BE THE RATEST FEATHER KEEPER IN HISTORY EXPECT HI DRAMA AND ORNITHOLOGY INSTAY WUS O O O O OO ON  O ACKED ONE THE SPECIMENS E QUIRK WARNING LET THIS EPISODE CONTONT THREW SWEARWORDS THAT WIV UNBEEPD FOR THE PODCAST VERSION YOU CAN FIND VIRGION WITH BEEPS AT OUR WEBSIGHTE THIS AMERICAN LIFE TOT WORD THE BIRDS HAD WH N STOLL I SAID THYE WERE VALUABLE SOME OF THEM WERE COLLECTED IN THE MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS BY ONE OF THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC EXPLORERS OF HIS TIME A MAN NAMED ALFRED RUSSELL WALLASE HE WAS LIKE ANOTHER DARWIN AND A PEER OF DARWINS ALFRED WALLACE SPENT NEARLY A DECADE THRASHING THROUGH THE MALAYARCA PELAGO CAPTURING IN PREPARING ANIMAL SPECIMENS AND SHIPPING THEM BACK TO ENGLAND HE LIVED IN TINY HUTS HIS FLESH REGULARLY INVADED BY BUGS AND ABOUT FOUR YEARS IN HE CONTRACTED MALARIA AN FIGURETE WULD JUST HUNKER DOWN IN HIS SHACK TO SWETT IT OUT AND WHILE HE'S YET IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS FEVER HE HAS A EURECA MOMENT AND FIGURES OUT EVOLUTION THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION COMPLETELY ON HIS OWN HE'S LIKE I'VE GOT IT LIKE I FIGURED IT OUT AND THIS IS BEFORE DARWIN CAME UP WITH IT BUT THIS IS THE KICKER HE SITS DOWN AND HE WRITES THIS PAPER MEANT FOR PUBLICATION AND HE PUTS IT AN ENVELOPE EN HE MAILS TO CHARLES DAR YWHO HAD NEVER PUBLISH ANYTHING ON THIS YET DARWIN HAD FIGURED IT OUP TOO AT THAT POINT BUT HE HAD BEEN TOO SCARED TO PUT IT OUT THERE THESE SPECIMENS WERE AS IMPORTANT AS DARWIN'S FINCHES WHICH BY THE WAY OR ALSO AT THE TRIN MUSEUM THEIR EARLY EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY AND SPECIMENS LIKE THESE CAN INFORM SCIENTISTS ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE WAY WE PRERCEIVE COLOR SCIENTISTS ARE STILL USING THEM ALFRED WALLACE HIMSELF ONCE WROTE THAT EACH SPECIES EACH BIRD IS AN INDIVIDUAL LETTER BUILDING THE WIRDS AND SENTENCES THAT DESCRIBED THE DEEP HISTORY OF OUR PLANET IF WE ALLOW THESE LETTERS TO DISAPPEAR THAT HISTORY DISAPPEARS WITH THEM HE ALSO WROTE THAT IT'S PROBABLY BEST IF PEOPLE FROM THE WEST NEVER SEA BIRDS LIKE THESE IN THEIR ORIGINAL HABITAT ANDALL THEIR BEAUTY AND GLORY BECAUSE THEY JUST PLUNDER THEM IN RUIN EVERYTHING HE HAD NO IDEA HOW RIGHT HE WOULD TURN OUT TO BE NOT LONG AFTER THERE WAS AN INDUSTRIALIZED SLAUGHTER ALL OVER THE WORLD AND IT WAS IN IN THE NAME OF WOMEN'S FASHION THIS WAS BACK WHEN WOMEN WERE A LOT OF HATS AND ANYONE WHO WAS ANYONE WERE HATS WITH A LOT OF FEATHERS ON THEM FROM PARROTS EGRETS OSSPRAYS DESINERS IN THE OUESS IN EUROPE COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE STUFF WHOLE SPECIES WERE DECIMATED BY THE FASHION IN THE SRY YOU SEE HATS DECORATED WITH IN TIHER BIRDS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THIS WAS LIKE THE GUCHY BAG IF YOU COULD ONLY AFFORD TO ROBIN THAT WAS ONE THING BUT IF YOU COULD AFFORD A BIRD OF PARADISE AND WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE BIRD BEING MOUNTED WITH OUTSTRETCHED WINGS AND AND IMMENIAN SOMETIMES THESE HATS HAD SEVERAL DIFFERENT BIRDS MOUNTED ON THEM HOLY CRO AND IT I AND IT'S EUM I MEAN THATS IT IS PUNNY BUT IT'S LIKE IT WAS HOW THEY DEMONSTRATED THEIR OWN PERCH IN SOCIETY SOME WOMEN HAD SO MANY BIRDS ON THEIR HATS THAT THEY HAD DESQUAT JUST IN ORDER TO FIT INTO THEIR CARRIAGES SO GAUDY AND INCONVENIENT MEANWHILE THE GENTLEMEN OF THE ARAW WERE ALSO SORT OF USING FEATHERS AS EXCESSORIES SALMON FLIES WERE LIKE HATS FOR GIES THIS WAS ALSO ROUND THE TIME THAT ALL THESE EXCLUSIVE FISHING CLUBS WERE POPPING UP ON THE COASTS OF ENGLAND IN SCOTLAND AND EACH CLUB HAD ITS OWN SPECIAL PATENTED SALMON FLY AND THE FLIES THEMSELVES HAD ALL THESE NAME S THEYRE ABSURD THERE LIKE THED EXORTIUM THE JACK SCOT THE DURHAM'S RANGER UM CAN I I JUST WANTED TOI JUST I JUST A GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE OF O CASE O THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR THE FIRST FLY THAT SAMMON FLY THAT EDWIN EVER TIED IT'S CALLED THE DURHAM RANGER THIS IS A RECIPE FROM THE EIGHTEEN FORTIES IND THE COLOREDTO RECIPE YES THE TALE CALLS FOR FEATHERS FROM THE INDIAN CROW WHICH IS THE RED ROUGH FRUIT CROW THAT'S ALL OVER SOUTH AMERICA THE BUT REQUIRES TWO TURNS OF BLACK OSTRICH HURL AM THE THROAT HAS LIGHT BLUE HACKEL USUALLY FROM THE KATINGA AH WHICH IS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA THE WINGS HAVE A PAIR OF LONG JUNGLE COCK FEATHERS WITH DOUBLE TIPITS ON BOTH SIDES IT GOES ON LIKE THAT THE CHEE SIR FROM TE BIRD CALLED A CHATTERER THE HORNS OR BLUEMA CAW IC WAS A PAROT OF COURSE BACK THEN WHEN YOU WANTED THESE FEATHERS YOU WENT DOWN TO THE LOCAL PLUME MERCHANT OR IN PARIS OF PLUMACIER AND YOU PAID REAL MONEY ROUN THE OU'RE NINETEEN HUNDRED CERTAIN SNOWY EGRET FEATHERS WERE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN GOLD FOR ME ALL I CAP FIXATING ON WAS THAT THIS IS THIS IS ALL BULSHET HAS THERE'S NO REASON WHY A SALMON SHOULD CARE ABOUT ANY OF THIS THEY DON'T I MEAN YOU YOU COULD TIE A CHOCOLATE WRAPPER TO A HOOK AND CATCH SALMON OH SO ALL OF THESE LITTLD SUBTLE TEES OF YOU KNOW WHICH SUB SPECIES DID YOU USE FOR THE CHEEK OF THE FEATHER THEY DON'T EVEN SEE ANY OF THAT THAT THAT' IDN'T MATTER TO VICTORIAN SALMON FLYTIRES BACK THEME AND THESE DAYS THE COMMUNITY TYING THIS KIND OF FLY STILL TRIES TO DO IT ACCORDING TO THE SAME CLASSICAL RECIPES IN THESE ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD MANUELS EXCEPT NOW THEY DON'T EVEN FISH WITH THEM THEY'RE JUST FOR SHOW HEUS FEATHERS FROM THE SAME SPECIES ARRANGED THE SAME EXACT WAY SO THE VIXATION IS ON HISTORICAL AUTHENTICITY LIKE A FLY TING VERSION ARE CIVIL WORRY IN ACTING BUT BECAUSE WE'VE MURDERED SO MANY BIRDS FOR SO MANY REASONS OVER THE YEARS A LOT OF THE MOST COVETED SPECIES ARE NOW ENDANGERED OR PROTECTED THERE'S A SPECIES OF KATINGA THAT IS JUST COMPLETELY I LEGAL TO TO BUY IN SALLATS THE KATINGA MACUATA AND THEY THEY COMPLETELY JONES OVER THIS STUFF I HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO FIND ANOTHER HOBBY WHO'S ADHERENTS ARE SO QUICKLY DRIVEN TO BREAK INTERNATIONAL LAWS HEN TO DO THE ART I MEAN YOU DON'T GET INTO THE DARK SIDE OF KNITTING OF COURSE NOT EVERY SALMON FLYTIRE IS BREAKING THE LAW BUT SOME OF THEM OPENLY FLOUT THE RULES ORE JUST IGNORE THEM VIOLATORS CAN BE FINE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THERE WAS A POST ON THE MAIN WEB FORM FOR THIS HOBBY CLASSIC FLYTYING DOT COME THAT SOMS UP THI SLAVISH ADDICTION TO CERTAIN FEATHERS ONE GUY SAID THERE'S SOMETHINGTO A FLY TIED WITH THE OLD MATERIALS AND SOMEONE ELSE RESPONDED I'VE MET THIS SOMETHING I'M HAUNTED BY IT CONSTANTLY NOW IT'S LIKE A DRUG NOTHING ELSE MATTERS NOTHING ELSE COMPARES WHEN IT TOUCHES MY FINGERS I FEEL THE HISTORY AM TAKEN BACK TO A TIME WHEN FISH WERE AS BIG AS LOGS FRESH FROM THE SEA REDS YELLOWS AND SHADES OF BLUES THEY'RE TEXTURE AND COLOR AN THAT POWER TO PUSH YOU TO DO YOUR BEST HERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAT COMPARES TO THAT POWER AC TO THE FLOUDIST ER GONE TO TO TALK O THER  EDWIN REST THE E MELLED HIM EVERY NOW AND THEN O WET TH  FORSE OF THREE YEARS ASKING FOR AN INTERVIEW EDWIN ALWAYS SAID NO IT WAS TO FO RAW AND THEN FINELY YOU AGREED GAVE KIRK LIKE A WEEK'S NOTICE KIRK AND HIS WIFE MARIJOSET FLUTED DUZULDWARF WHERE EDWIN WAS LIVING PLAYING IN AN ONSONDL TWHICH IS THE MUSIC YOU'RE HEARING WRI KNOW BUT MARIJIOSE WAS WORRIED THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE SKY YOU BROKEN INTO A MUSEUM AFTER ALL WHO KNEW WHAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF HE WAS DANGEROUS AND THEY WERE MEETING HIM AT THEIR HOTEL ROOM SO THEY HIRED A GERMAN BODY GUARD WHO SAT OUT IN THE HALLWAY DURING THE AIGHT HOUR INTERVIEW THEY NEEDN'T HAVE BOTHERED EDWIN WELL TAUL WAS NOT IMPOSING EVEN IN HIS BLACK PEACOAT HE WAS FRIENDLY KARK LIKE HIM THOUGH THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT KIRK'S OGGOSH FARMBOY AMIDWESTERNNESS AND EDWIN'S LIVING IN A RAREFIED WORLD OF FLUTES AND FEATHERS IN EUROPE WE ASKED EDWIN IF WE COULD AIR PARTS OF THEIR INTERVIEW ON THE SHOW AND HE SAID NO SO YEU WON'T HEAR HIS VOICE BUT A LOT OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW HE CAME TO BE IN THE MUSEUM THAT NIGHT COME STRAIGHT FROM HIM HE GROW UP IN A QUIET TOWN IN NEW YORK STATE SOUTH OF ALBANY HUSCUT A SORT OF LIKE HAIRY POTTER WITH THICK WIREHIM GLASSES BIT OF AN ENDOORSY KID HOME SCHOOLED ALONG WITH HIS YOUNGER BROTHER AND EVEN BACK THEN HE WAS SHAPING UP TO BE A GREAT MUSICION EDWIN'S PARENTS WERE BOTH JOURNALISTS AND WHEN EDWIN WAS ABOUT TEN HIS DAD WAS RESEARCHING HIS STORY FOR DISCOVER MAGAZINE ABOUT THE PHYSICS OF FLY CASTING SO EDWIN HAPPENED TO WATCH AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDIO ON HOW TO TIE FLIES USING THE SPECIFIC KIND OF FEATHER CALLED A HACKL O WABLE LET'S TY THE HACKLE AROUND THE BASE OF THE WAY SO THAT IT FLOATS LOWER IN THE SURFACE AND PERHAPS LOOKS LIKE A MAY FLY A REST AND TE FEATHER IS TRANSFORMED IT IT SUDDENLY THE HOOK HADS LIKE A THOUSAND LITTLE LEGS STICKING OUT IN EVERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION NOW IT LOOKS LIKE A LICK A SENAPE YES AND FOR WHATEVER REASON TEN YEAR OLD EDWIN'S BRAIN WAS JUST FROZEN BY THIS SEEN SOMETHING SO ORDINARY TRANSFORM INTO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY LIKE THAT WAS AMAZING TO HIM EDWIN TOLD KIRK THAT HE AND HIS BROTHER WATCHED THAT PART OF THE VIDIOMI EIGHT TIVES AND SOON HE WAS RUMMAGING THROUGH THE GORRAGE IN THE BASEMEN LOOKING FOR A HOOK AND THREAD ANYTHING HE COULD FIND TO TRYAT HIMSELF HE PLUCKED THE FEATHERS FROM HIS MOMS DOWN PILLOW HIS DAD SEEING ALL OF THIS FINALLY BROUGHT EDWIN TO A TACKLESHOP GOT HIM A VICE AND SOME HOOKS AND OTHER MATERIALS SO HE COULD START TYING FLIES FOR REAL TROUB FLIES TO BEGIN WITH THE UGLY ONES EDWIN'S BROTHER GOT INTO A TWO THEY TOOK CLASSES SPENT HOURS HUNKERED OVER THEIR CREATIONS AN THIS KIND OF FUZZY TRAINNS BEFORE TOO LONG THERE WERE WINNING FLY TYING COMPETITIONS AND GOING TO CONVENTIONS AND IT WAS AT ONE OF THOSE CONVENTIONS WERE EDWIN LAID EYES ON HIS FIRST SAMMON FLY IT WAS AT THE BOOTH OF A PROMINENT FLY TIRANT NAMED EDWARD MUZZEROLL OR MUZZY FOR SHORT AND ONCE AGAIN LITTLE EDWIN'S MIND JUST FROZE IT WAS THE SAME REACTION KIRK HAT THAT DAY ON THE WATER TOTAL BE DAZZLEMENT AND HE'S KIND OF OWIN AND IN AND HE STARTS TALKING TO MUZZY AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT HE'S ARRANGING FOR PRIVATE LESSONS WITH MUZZY TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS THIS NEW TYPE OF FLY TIN NEW TO EDWIN AND SO I THINK HE WAS FOURTEEN WHEN HE WENT UP TO MAIN ONE SUMMER AND AND GOT LESSONS I THINK IT WAS EIGHT OR TWELVE HOUR DAYS FER MUZZY PROCEEDED TO WALK OM THROUGH NOT JUST THE THE TECHNIQUES BUT THE HISTORY OF THIS ART FORM DURING THAT FIRSTATORIAL WITH MUZZY THOUGH WHERE EDWIN TIED THE DURHAM RANGER THEY USED SUBSTITUTE FEATHERS OR SUBS MEANING NO REDROUGH FRUIT CROW NO BLACK OSTRICH RAL INSTEADLY USED LIKE DIED CHICKEN FEATHERS OR WHATEVER AND MUZZY H' BEEN TYING FLIES LONGER THAN EDWIN HAD BEEN ALIVE COULD TELL RIGHT AWAY THAT EDWIN WAS A NATURAL A PRODIGY AND SO AT THE END OF THAT SESSION THAT FIRST SESSION WHEN MUZZY' SAYING GOOD BY HE GIVES EDWIN AN ENVELOPE AND N IN HUSH TONE SAID THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT EDWIN OPENS THE ENVELOPE AND INSIDE IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF EXOTIC BIRD FEATHERS FROM THE REDRA FRUIT CROW AND FROM KATINGA I THINK NOW MUZZY'S STUFF WAS LEGAL AND IT WAS A GESTURE TO THIS YOUNG AKOLIHT ALMUST LIKE A LIKE WORK YOUR WAY UP TO THESE THINGS YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOU GET GOOD ENOUGH TER TRY USING ONE OF THESE REDRA FRUT CRO FEATHERS IN THAT'S WHEN EDWIN CAUGHT THE BUG ALL HE WANTED TO USE IN HIS FLIES WERE EXOTIC BIRD FEATHERS FROM THEN ON HE STARTED DOING CURES FOR HIS NEIGHBORS GATHERING FIREWOOD JUST FOR LITTLE EXTRA FEATHER MONEY HE SOON GREW INTO A MASTER FLY TIRE WHICH BY THE WAY MEANS AN EXPERT MIMICER ABLE TOO CONSISTENTLY AND PERFECTLY HUE TO THE SAME CLASSIC RECIPES AGAIN AND AGAIN UT THRE WAS ALWAYS THIS ONE LIMITATION AS TO WHAT HE COULD ACCOMPLISH AS GOOD AS EDWIN GOT AND AND M HE WAS HERALDED AS THE FUTURE OF FLY TINE BY FLY TIRE MAGAZINE WHICH I SUBSCRIBED TO ALY TO HE OLT HE WAS COMPLETELY EMBRACED BY THIS COMMUNITY BY HIS SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY THINK WHEN HE WAS A LENGENT ALREADY BUT AS GOOD AS HE WAS HE WAS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WHO WASN'T REALLY FLUSH WITH CASH AND SO WHENEVER THERE WAS THESE OCCASIONAL E BAY AUCTIONS OF OF THE SPECIES THAT HE WANTED HE ALWAYS GOT OUTBID BY THESE WEALTHIER OLDER FLY TIRES WHO HAD DISPOSAL INCOME AND SO HE'S DEVOTION TO THIS ART FORM WAS KIND OF ALWAYS TO FINED BY A LONGING FOR WHAT HE DIDN'T HAVE THESE OTHER GUIDES WOULD SAY THE I WIL IT'S A GOOD FLY BUT I NO TALK TO ME WHEN HE GETS IM REAL KATINGA THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FO'L THAT GOOD NO ESPECIALLY TO A KID EDWIN HAS THI SPECIFIC WAY OF TALKING PERHAPS CULTIVATED FROM LIVING IN EUROPE FOR MANY YEARS AND ON THE TOPIC OF USING SUBSTITUTE FEATHERS INSTEAD OF THE REAL THING HE TOLD KIRK THE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS FALSITY EATS AT YOU SO IN A WAY EDIN WAS A POPPER MUSITION GAZING THROUGH A SHOP WINDOW AT A SHINY MUSICAL INSTRUMENT WHICH BY THE WAY HE LITERALLY WAS THAT TOO AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS EXCELLING AT FLY TYING HE WAS ALSO EXCELLING AT THE FLUTE JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE THIS IS A YOU TU VIDIO EDWIN POSTED OF HIM COVERING MASTER OF POPET'S BY METALICA PLAYING ALL THE PARTS ON DIFFERENT FLUTES ANYWAY HE WAS FINALLY ADMITTED TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF MUSIC IN LONDON BUT HE DIDN'T BRING ANY OF HIS FLY TINE YEAR OR FEATHERS WITH HIM HE SAID CUSTOMS WOULDN'T OF APPRECIATED HIS BIRDIY BAG AROUND THE SAME TIME A FLY TYING FRIEND IN CANADA AND SOMETHING OF A MENTOR TO EDWIN SENT HIM IN EMAIL SAYING BASICALLY HEH WHILE YOU 'RE OVER THERE YOU'VE GOT A CHICK OUT THIS PLACE NORTH OF LONDON A BRANCH OF THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM AN A TOWN CALLED TRING HE ATTACHED PICTURES OF DRAWERS FILLED WITH BRILLIANTLY COLORFUL BIRD SPECIMEN S THEY WORN'T ON DISPLAY THERE WRE STORED AWAY IN A SPECIAL WING OF THE MUSEUM THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC ISN'T ALOWED INTO ACTRY THE MUSEUM THE TRAIN IS THIS BIG OLD BRICTUTOR BUILDING FROM THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES AND THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A PRIVATE MANSION OR A BOY SCHOOL THAN A MUSEUM THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEE THAT SPECIAL BIRD COLLECTION IS FOR LEGITIMATE RESEARCH PURPOSES SO EDWIN CAME UP WITH A PLAN A LINE HE EMAILED THE MUSEUM AND TOLD THEM HE NEEDED TO FPHOTOGRAPH THE BIRDS FOR A FRIEND'S PAGE DFESIS AND ON NOVEMBER FIFTH TWO THOUSAND AT HE BROUGHT A CAMERA TO THE MUSEUM SIGNED THE VISITOR LOG BOOK USING HIS OWN NAME AND WAS ESCORTED TO THE BIRDS OF PARADISE COLLECTION YOU CAN TELL A RESEARCH SPECIMEN OF A BIRD FROM A MILE AWAY THEIR EYE SOCKETS ARE STUFFED WITH COTTON THEIRE WINGS FOLDED DOWN AT THEIR SIDES LEGS STIFF THERE REFERRED TO AS BIRD SKINS AND IMPORTANTLY THE LEGS HAVE THESE TAGS ATTACHED TO THEM WITH THE SPECIES AND DATE AND OTHER BYODATA AND IN THIS CASE ALFRED WALLACE'S SIGNATURE WITHOUT THAT TAG THE SPECIMEN ISN'T A SPECIMEN ANY MORE IT'S JUST A BIRD WHO KNOWS WHERE THE HELLIT CAME FROM BUT RESEARCH OF COURSE WAS THE LAST THING ON EDWIN'S MIND LOOKING AT THE BIRDS HE WAS JUST AN AWE OF THEIR ARRESTING BEAUTY HE MADE THIS ANALOGY HE SAID IF I PUT A GOLD BRICK ON THE TABLE IT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE THERE'S A SHOCK VALUE OF UNDERSTANDING WHILE THAT'S REALLY VALUABLE AND THEN THIS IS THE THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD ME HEGOS IF YOU GO TO FORT KNOCKS IF YOU GO INTO THE VAULT THERE'S A DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FEELING THEN JUST SEEN IC A GOLD BRICK QUOTE FOR A FLY TIRE FOR SOME ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE FEATHERS AND SEES THE POTENTOIN THEN AND WHO REALLY HAS A PASSION I GUESS YOU CALL IT AN ABS ESSION I DON'T LIKE TO USE IT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE A NEGATIVE TERM BUT THAT OVERWHELMING WO WHAT HAVE I JUST SEEN FEELING WAS ALL THAT I HAD AND I REMEMBER IT TO THIS POINT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO EXTRAORDINARY AND THE SAD THING HE TOLD ME Y IS THAT MAN MANY MANY WELL MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE OEDWIN PHOTOGRAPHED ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BIRDS THAT DAY AND HE SAYS HE WASN'T CASING THE MUSEUM THAT FIRST TIME HE JUST WANTED TO LOOK EXCEPT HE ALSO TOOK PICTURES OF THE AREA AROUND THE MUSEUM THOSE SURELY WERE NOT INTERESTING PHOTOGRAPHS THUT THEY MAY HAVE PROVED USEFUL LATER ON OUTN ALSO HE OPENS UP MIKRUSEV WORD ON HIS COMPUTER AND CREATES A FILE CALLED PLAN FOR MUSEUM INVASION DATA E E TA E EGGET UAND'S A LITTLE ON THE I DON'T BUT YOU DON'T THINK ANYONE'S EVER GOING TO SEE YOUR HARD DRIVE YOU KNOW LIKE IN SOME WAYS IT WAS LIKE A IT'S A SMART THING TO DO LIKE TO BUILD A LIST OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE GIN TO NEED TO PULL OFF A MUSEUM HEIGHES YOU DON'T WANT JUST WING THAT WING E  T NO BUT I MA HHE WROTE ON THERE THAT M HE WOULD NEED A GLASS CUTTER AND I SAID WAS THIS LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU SEEN THE MOVY WERE YOU KNOW IT'S SOME PERFECT DISSHAVED GLA EXACTLY ACAN PINK PAN YE UM AND IT IT WAS JUST LIKE A HAND HELD LIKE ALMOST LIKE AN EXACT O KNIFE AND AS LIKALE DID YOU PRACTICSE AND HES LIKE NOW I DON'T THINK IT COULD BE THAT HARD THE EVENING OF JUNE TWENTY THIRD TWO THOUSAND NINE EDWIN FINISHED PLAYING A CONCERT AT THE ROYAL ACAT O ME OF MUSIC AND BORDED A TRAIN TO TRAIN ACCORDING TO HIM HE BROUGHT ALONG ONLY ONE EMPTY SUITCASE A PAIR OF LATEX' GLOVES HE TOOK FROM HIS DOCTORS OFFICE SOME WIRE CLIPPERS A LITTLE ELY DELIKHE AND THE GLASS CUTTER AT FOR O THE HIGHESTE CAME O AI CAME U NO THI TING ON FOOT WI I SCA ON THE NOING TIKIN U HEDFOL THE DETECTIVE ON THE CASE A DELL HOPKIN TOOK CIRK TO THE CRIME SCENE UP PUBLIC FOOT PAST THIRTY SEVEN AND TRIN TO A SORT OF SECLUDED AREA OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM N TE CAMET O MEN A THEN HE TAN E SHM U E FOL WHIC ES TOL A UP HERS THE SOLT HE CLIPPED SOME STRANDS OF BARBED WIRE IN ORDER TO GET TO A WINDOW THIS WEND I HER WHICH SNUGGLE TO BALLS AND WAS THE REASON HE BROUGHT THE GLASS CUTTER WHICH IT TURNS OUT HE DROPPED ALONG THE WAY SOMEWHERE HE HAD A MOMENT OF DOUBT WERE HE STARTED SAYING TO HIMSELF MAY BE THAT SOME KIND OF SIGHIN THAT  THOT'S PLS TO DO THIS LIKE MAYBE I SHOULD JUST BAL ON THIS WHOLE THING BUT THAT THIS OTHER VOICE IN HIS HEAD SAID NO YOU'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS FOR EVERLIKE JUST FIGURE IT OUT SO HE USED A DIFFERENT KIND OF GLASS CUTTER E GIANT ROCK AN AN I JUST SMUSHED TO ONE OF HE WINDOWS AND AN EN WINS IN EDWIN SAYS HE'S NOT SURE HOW HE DIDN'T CAUT HIMSELF UP ON THE GLASS AND AN ALARM IS TRIGGERD IN THE MUSEUM AND THERE IS A SECURITY GUARD THERE THAT NIGHT THIS IS A VERY CONTENTIOUS POINT BUT EDWIN TOLD ME THAT HE THINKS THAT THE SECURITY GUARD WAS ENGROSSED IN A SOCKER MATCH THE MUSEUM VIULENTLY DENIES THIS AND THEY TOLD ME THE SECURITY THAT PARTICULAR SECURITY GUARD DOESN'T EVEN LIKE SOCKER BUT ONE THING THAT WERE CERTAIN OF IS THAT AN ALARM WAS TRIGGER E SECURITY GUARD DID NOT NOTICE IT IN EDWIN HAD THE RUN OF THE PLACE AN HE WAS IN THERE UNDETECTED FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR IT WAS A WEIRDLY EASY THING TO PULL OFF HIS PLAN HAD JUST BEEN TO TAKE A COUPLE OF THE BEST SPECIMENS OF EACH SPECIES BUT IN THE DARK WITH JUST AS LITTLE ELLIDY PINCH LIGHT HE COULDN'T SEE WHICH WERE THE BEST ONES SO HE JUST S TARTED GRABBING WHATEVER HE COULD FIT IN HIS HANDS  THE KA TINGAS WERE SMALL AE BAGGED ABOUT A HUNDRED OF THOSE THE RESPLENDENT CETSALLS THOUGH WERE TRICKIER E HAD THE CAREFULLY COILED THEIR LONG TAILS AND ORD TO MAKE THEM THIT HE MOVED FROM CABINET TO CABINET SOMETIMES EMPTYING HOLE DRAWERS WERE NEARLY HE TOOK FORTY SEVEN OF THE MUSEUMS FORTY EIGHT RED ROUGH FRUIT CROW HE ONLY LEFT THE LAST ONE AS HE DIDN'T SEE AT WEDGE IN THE BACK OF THE TRAY BECAUSE HE'S BEEN IT BEFOL  YOU XACATSKA WOR HE WONC SIT TO TE SUITCAS IT JBA CHATASI KARK TRIED TO GET EDWIN TO DESCRIBE THE FEELING THAT HE HAD LOADING THE BIRDS IN TO THE SUIT CASE BUT SITTING TOGETHER IN THE HOTELL IN DUZILDOR EDWIN WAS STRANGELY DEVOID ON THI SCORE HE TOLD KIRK IT WASN'T LIKE OTHEIR MIND NOW HOHOHO IT WAS SURPRISINGLY UNEXCITING AND TECNICAL LIKE HOW DO I MAKE THEM FIT THUGH HE DID ADMIT THAT EVEN HE WAS AMAZED HE MANAGED TO PULL IT OFF EDWIN SAID QUOTE THE FACT THAT ESSENTIALLY AN IDIOT WITH A ROCK COULD STEAL A SUIT CASE FULL OF BIRDS FROM THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM EVEN AS I THINK ABOUT IT AND I'V THOUGHT ABOUT THIS MYSELF IT'S ABSURD AND THEN HE WENT OUT THE WAY HE CAME IN SHOT THE SUIT CASE BACK OUT OF THE WINDOW FIRST AND CLIMBED OUT AFTER IT AT WHICH POINT THIS TOTAL EXHAUSTION FELL OVER HIM DRAGGING ONE FOOT AFTER THE OTHER BACK TO TOWN AND MIXED IN WITH THE FATIGUE WAS PARONOIA WHEN HE GOT TO THE TRAIN PLATFORM EVERY SET OF FOOTVALLS ON THE WALKWAY ABOVE HIM WAS A POTENTIAL THREAD AND HE WAS THERE FOR HOURS HE HAD MISSED THE LAST TRAIN BACK TO LONDON THAT NIGHT AND HAD TO SIT ON THE PLATFORM WITH A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BIRDS UNTIL FOUR IN THE MORNING HE GOMT BACK TO HIS ROOM HAD THIS KIND OF VUFORIC MOMENT WHERE HE LAID OUT ALL THE BIRDS AND CUN OF REALIZED THAT THE SUCCESSIVE HIS HALL ON THE FLOOR OR I I THINK HE LAID HIM OUT ON HIS BED UH TE LIKE ROLL AROUN AND IT TAT  BIRDS IAN THAT I DON'T KNOW BADAM THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE ON PLANET EARTH THAT HAD THIS MANY FLALAS SPECIMENS OF THESE SPECIES TO NOW BE SITTING WITH THIS HALL I HET WOULD JUST HE WOULD PUNCH THROUGH TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FLY TINE ECAUSE HE WOULDN'T WANT FOR ANYTHING AND HE WOULD JUST HAVE THIS KIND OF HE HE COULD JUST  TOTALLY IN A DIFFERENT GAME NOW AND NO ONE ELSE IS ABLE TO PLAY WITH IT YOU KNOW AND IF THEY WANTED TO PLAY THEY'D HAVE TO PAY THROUGH THE NOSE AGAIN EDWIN HAD STOLEN TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE BIRDS FROM THE MUSEUM H WOULD NEVER HAVE TO WONDER AGAIN WHERE HIS NEXT FEATHER WAS COMING FROM THE BROKEN WINDOW WASN'T DISCOVERED INTO THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE COPS WERE CALLED IN THEY LOOK AROUND AND THE MUSEUM AND THE COPS TOGETHER CONCLUDE THAT NOTHING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STOLEN WAIT WHAT YEM THEY WENT LOOKING FOR THE THINGS THAT THEY KNEW HAD A HUGE MARKET VALUE LIKE DARWIN'S BIRDS DARWIN'S BIRDS THE FAMOUS FINCHES WHICH WERE STILL SAFELY CUDDLED IN THEIR DRAWER ONCE AGAIN ALFRED WALLAC WAS SECOND BEST TO DARWIN YE I WENT THROUGH  THAT'S TO ME IT WAS LIKE ONE OF THE FINE OLD BLOWS TO HIM IS BED IF THEY HAD CARED ABOUT WALLACE AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AND CHECK TO MIX SURE THAT WALLACE IS BIRDS WERE STILL THERE BUT THEY DIDN'T AND IF THEY HAD DONE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY HAD BEEN ROBBED THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A BIG HAD START ON THINGS BUT AS IT HAPPENED IT TOOK THEM ALMOST I COUWAS WELL OVER MONTH BEFORE THEY VEN FOUND OUT THUT THEY WERE ROBBED THIRTY FIVE DAYS IN FACT THE CLOSES CIRCUIT SURVELLANCE CAMERAS IN THE TOWN OF TRING RESET AFTER TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AIN A STATEMENT TO US THE MUSEUM SAID PARFHRASING HERE THAT THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT AN THE SECURITY AND WELFARE OF THE COLLECTION AND AFTER THE THAT THEY CHANGED HOW THEY GRAN ACCESS TO THE COLLECTIONS AND ALSO BEEFED UP THEIR SECURITY MATERS AN  AN AN N  TIN THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS ONLY WHEN SOME ONE WROTE TO THE MUSEUM WITH A QUESTION ABOUT ONE OF THE SPECIES THAT A CURATOR WENT TO THAT CABINETS OPENED THE DRAWER AND SAW THAT IT WAS EMITY WAS A HUGE BELOW THE CURATORS AT THE TRING ARE PART OF A LONG LINEAGE CARING FOR AND PROTECTING THIS COLLECTION TDURING THE BLITS OF LONDON AND WORLD WERE TOO BOMS RAINING DOWN EVERYWHERE IY WAS THEIR PREDECESSORS WHO BUNDLED UP THE MUSEUM SBIRD SPECIMENS AND SECRETED THEM OUT OF THE CITY UP TO THEIR NEW LOCATION IN TRAING THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THERE SO THEY'D BE SAFE AND NOW UNDER THE WATCH OF COLLECTIONS MANAGER ROBERT PRIEST JONES THIS HAPPENED THERE IS A MISSING JHUNK FROM THE RECORD IM I IN SOMETHING LOT FIND BABAD IT IS A MISSING CHUNGTHAT YOU KNOW A REALLY SUBSANTIAL PUSSIBLY OUT OF THE HOLS OF THE WORLDS RESULTS ALL THAT SPECIES IS NOW MISSING THE WHOLE THING WAS A COMPLETE KICK IN THE GUTS IT WAS DESPERATELY DEEPLYT DEPRESSE ALFRED WALLACE'S BIRDS SURVIVED HITLER BUT NOT EDWIN RIST  THE INVESTIGATORS DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF OBVIOUS CLUES TO GO ON THRE WAS ALMOST NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE BUT HAD THE POLICE OR THE MUSEUM LOOKED IN THE VISITORS LOG THE WOULD HAVE FOUND EDWIN'S FULL NAME WHICH IF SOME ONE GUGLED IT THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND EDWIN RISTOT CALM ON WHICH HE WAS SELLING SOME OF THEIR SPECIMENS USING THEIR LATIN NAMES THEY ALSO WOULD AVE QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT HE PLAYED THE FLUTE AND IF THEY HAD GONE LOOKING FOR THE BIRDS ON EBE ERE THE FLY TYING FOR HIMS THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND BIRDS FOR SALE FROM SOME ONE WITH THE HANDLE FLUTE PLAYER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ONE OF THE POSTS WAS TITLED INDIAN CROWFEATHERS FOR SALE BUYING NEW FLUTE IF ANY OF THE BUYERS ASKED EDWIN MADE UP STORIES AS TO WHERE THE BIRDS CAME FROM BUT MOSTLY NO ONE ASKED THEY DIDN'T WANT AKNOW THE WAY EDWIN FINALLY GOT CAUGHT WAS SORT OF RANDOM A TIP CAME IN FROM A FLY TIRER WHO HAD SEEN A BIRD SKIN AT A FECTIVAL AND THE NETHERLANDS OF ALL PLACES THAT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE COME FROM THE TRAIN AND THE GUY TRACED IT BACK TO FLUTEPLAYER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ON EBA IT TOOK SOME DOING BUT THE POLICE FINALLY TRACKED EDWIN DOWN AND SHOWED UP AT HIS APARTMENT WITH A WARRANT ONE YEAR AFTER THE BREAK IN HE CONFESSED IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT THE OFFICERS INTO HIS BEDROOM WERE HIS GIRLLFRIEND WAS STILL SLEEPING AND SHOWED THEM THE BIRDS SINCE HE CONFESSED AND PLED GUILTY THE CASE WENT RIGHT TO SENTENCING EDWIN WAS LOOKING AT TEN YEARS FOR BURGLARY AND FOURTEEN YEARS FOR SELLING STOLEN GOODS BUT DURING THE SENTENCING PROCESS EDWIN'S LAWYERS BROUGHT IN A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO DIAGNOSED HIM WITH ASKE FURKER SENDRUM THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING THE JUDGE IN HIS STATEMENT SAID THAT EDWIN'S CRIME WHOLLY MERITED A LENGTHY PRISON SENTENCE HESAID THE CRIME MOUNTED TO QUOTE A NATURAL HISTORY DISASTER OF WORLD PROPORTIONS BUT HE SAID BECAUSE OF THE DIAGNOSES AND A LEGAL PRECEDENT IN THE UKE INVOLVING ASKPURGERS A LONG PRISON SENTENCE WOULD PROBABLY BE OVERTURNED ON A PEAL SO HE SENTENCED EDWIN TO ONE YEAR SUSPENDED THERE WAS A FINANCIAL PENALTY TOO BUT MOD TINBEHIND BARS OF THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE BIRDS A THIRD OF THEM CAME BACK TO THE TRAING ONSKAIGHT ANOTHER THIRD HAD BEEN PLUCKED AT WERE TISMANTLE WERE IN SOME WAY COMPROMISED CHIEFLY THEIR BUYO DATE ATTACKS HAD BEEN REMOVED WITH THE DATE AND SPECIES AND ALFRED WALLACE'S SIGNATURE WHICH MEANT THOSE SPECIMENS WERE NOW USELESS TO SCIENCE AND THE LAST THIRD DID NOT COME BACK TO THE MUSEUM THEY WERE GONE MISSING SOME OF THEM WERE SOLD BUT CERTAINLY NOT ALL OF THEM WHERE WERE THEY WHEN EDWIN WAS CAUGHT HE PLEADED HIS GUILT WHICH MEANT THAT THE THE INVESTIGATION STOPPED AND THERE WAS NO SEARCH FOR THE FOR ANYTHING ELSE THE MUSEUM WASN'T LOOKING FOR IT THE BRITISH POLICE WASN'T LOOKING FOR IT AND AS I WAS STARTING TO DIG AROUND IN THESE FORMS THATD I WOULD SEE OCCASIONS OR GUY'S CRACKING JOKES ABOUT THE HEIST AND LIKE IT IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS A A REFORMED COMMUNITY IW'S LIKE THIS IS NOTS LIKE WHITWIC SOME HAES GOT FIND THESE THINGS AND KIRK IS SOME ONE WHO CAN'T STOP HIMSELF WHEN HE COMES ACROSS AND INJUSTIST THAT HE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO FIX ALSO THIS UNSETTLING THING HAPPENED DURING THE INTERVIEW KIRK SAYS EDWIN JUST IDN'T SEEM LIKE SOME ONE WITH ASEBURGERS AND AFTER SIX OF THEIR EIGHT HOURS TOGETHER HE TOLD HIM SO EDWIN RESPONDED THAT HE HADN'T EXHIBITED ANY OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS OF THE DISORDER UNTIL HE WAS IN THE EVALUATION ROOM NOT LONG BEFORE SENTENCING HE SAID I BECAME EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IT FI'M BEIN AST I WAS PISED OFF LIKE THIS IS THIS STARTED OUT AS JUST THE CORKY FUNNY STORY TO ME BUT WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT WALLACE WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT THE DEBT THAT WE HAVE TO THESE SPECIMEN COLLECTIONS AND THAT THEY WERE STILL OUT THERE A LOT OF THEM WERE STILL MISSING THEN IT TOOK ON IS MORE SERIOUS THE AVAILANCE THAT WERE SUDDENLY I WAS LIKE LOCATISIS AND JUST LIKE A FUNNY THING LIKE THEIRS YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND GET IT ANOTHER BIRD FROM EIGHTEEN SIXTY ANY MORE THAT THAT BIRDS GONE AND WHAN I MET WAS A KID WHO WAS NOT REMORSEFUL WHO KIND OF GRIMAST WHEN I REFERRED TO HIM AS A THIEF AT ONE POINT AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE DOESN'T THINK OF HIMSELF AS A THIEF YOU KNOW AR WET THE ANGER LEVEL AT THIS POINT LIKE PROBABLY AAPPROACHING THERE IM BECAUS NOW IT'S HIS I THIS IS A CASE CLOTHED AND NO ONE'S LOOKING FOR THESE BIRDS AND I'M STILL ON THESE FORM SEEN PEOPLE TRADING AND SELLING THINGS THAT LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE EDWIN'S BIRDS HAD EDWIN HIDDEN A BUNCH AWAY AND WAS STILL SELLING THEM TOS SOME ONE ELSE SELLING THEM KIRK COULDN'T LET IT GO AND THEN HE HAD A KIND OF BREAK THROUG AD BECAME CERTAIN THAT HE KNEW WHERE ALL OF THE MISSING SPECIMENS WER OCA IAN IN COMING UP CIRK GOES

STRAIGHT LINE BACK TO ALL US WHALLIS WHO WROTE ALL LIVING THINGS WERE NOT MADE FOR MAN AGAIN STILL WHILLIST PROBABLY NEVER PICTURED TWO GUYS PORING OVER THE DETACHED FEATHERS OF HIS BIRDS IN A BAR IN

BE GREAT YE ON THROUG TEES SAND T I JUST REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY HAVING TWO THHOTS ONE WAS HERE THEY ARE I FOUND THEM AN HOW CAN YOU TELL SO QUICKLY WHICH OER WIR WITCATEER A YOUARE FORTY THERE FORTY OR ONE AND AN AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZING JUST HOW PATHATIC IT ALL WAS AND HOW SMALL IT ALL WAS THERE WARN'T THERE WASN'T A BOX OF MISSING BIRDS THERE WERE NO LABELS THESE THINGS I KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THERE THERE JUST PLUCKED HARVESTED FEATHERS FROM HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR OLD BIRDS THAT WILL NEVER TBE RETURNED TO THEIR IF YOU CAN'T REATTACHED ON TO A BIRD YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM EN AND SO IT WAS IS COMPLICATED MOMENT WHERE I WAS REALLY KIND OF LIKE PROUD BUT ALSO A LITTLE EMBARRASSED BECAUSE I WAS LIKE THIS IS NOT THERE'S NOTHING REALLY TRIUMPHANT ABOUT THIS MOMENT KIRK TOLD LONG HE THOUGHT LONG SHOULD SEND THE FEATHERS BACK TO THE MUSEUM PARDLY BECAUSE IT MIGHT HELP LONG PUT THE WHOLE UGLY BUSINESS BEHIND HIM LONG AGREED IT TOOK HIM A FEW MONTHS BUT HE FINALLY STUFFED THEM ALL INTO AN ENVELOPE WITH NO RETURN ADDRESS KIRK LEARNED OF TWO OTHER FULL BIRD SKINS THAT DEFINITIVELY CAME FROM THE TRAIN THE BUYER LIVES IN SOUTH AFRICA AND HIS NOW INTEREST AND SUNDY  BAK ABOUT TWENTY OTHERS BELONGING TO A GUYND MUCH RE ALL IKE LIKE POSSIBLE TRAIN BIRS UT WE SOLD THEM ALRITY  AND STHEY LONG SOL TAND MORE OF THEM THAT WOULD BRING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BIRDS ON ACCOUNTED FOR DOWN THE THIRTY TWO ICH MEANS E THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO FIND OUT WHATD HAPPENED TO ALL OF THE MANY MORE AND BE EDWIN IS NOT THE ONLY FLY TIRE IN THE WORLD WHO FELT OQET ABOUT KNOWINGLY OWNING STOLE AN PROPERTY ANYONE WHO BOUGHT ANYTHING FROM HIM SHOULD SEND IT BACK TO THE MUSEUM IN WHATEVER SHAPE IS IT BUT WHAT WOULD COM OF THEM SENDING BACK PARTS OF BIRDS OR FEATHERS OR WHATEVER YOUNG NOTHE NO SCIENTIFIC VALUE AND ME MAY BE IN A YOU KNOW SOME ONE WILL FIGURE OUT DOWN A LINE HOWTED FE  FIGURE OUT WHICH FEATHER CAME FROM WHICH BIRD BUT IT WOULD JUST BE A A MORAL VICTORY HONESTLY HE MORAL VICTORY YE I MEAN IT'S NOT THER AND  I'M FULLY AWARE OF THAT LIKE THE NO CAN O BE USED BUT THEY DON'T BELONG TO THIS TO THIS COMMUNITY THEY BELONG TO THAT MUSEUM AND AND THE END OF THIS SHOULD BE EVERYONE JUST RETURN THING GS THAT THEY KNOW OUR STOLEN EVEN IF IT'S TWO FEATHERS AND THEY CAN WALK AROUND WITH THEIR HEAD A LITTLE BIT HIGHER AND MABE AS JUS SO STUPID OF ME FOR IS SUGGESTING THIS BUT IF THE CHOICE IS BETWEEN THEM RETURNING IT AND THEM GETTING TO KEEP IT THAT SEEMS EASY TO ME BUT KIRK FINALLY DECIDED TO LET GO OF THIS CASE HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BECOME JUST AS OBSESSIVE AS EDWIN ABOUT TS BRDS AND AS OBSESSIVE AS WALLACE FOR THAT MATTER ALL THREE MEN FOR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT REASONS SPENT YEARS FIXATING OVER THE VERY SAME BIRDS NOT THE SAME SPECIES THE SAME PHYSICAL ANIMALS WALLACE WANTED KNOWLEDGE EDWIN SA A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL COLLERS AND GESTALLER SIGNS AN KIRK THOUGH HE KNOWS HOW LOONY THIS SOUNDS WANTED TO AVENGE THE BIRDS AS A LAST STITCH EFFORT AND WITH THE MUSEUM'S KNOWLEDGE HE WENT ON THE MAIN FLYTIME FOR EM AND SAID THAT THE TRAING WAS READY TO ACCEPT ANY ANONYMOUS RETURNS NO QUESTIONS ASKED HE SAID AS MUCH AS I WOULD PERSONALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHO MIGHT BE IN POSSESSION OF ANY OF THE MISSIC SKINS IT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT THEY BE RETURNS AND I HAVE INCLUDED THE MUSEUMS ADDRESS BELOW FOR ANY ONE WHO IS SO INCLINE I DON'T MEAN TO LECTURE AND I MAGIN THAT SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE ANNOYD BY THIS POIN BUT I AM CHALLENGING YOU TO HELP REMOVE THIS CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER YOUR HOBY SIMPLY TO LEADING ANY REFERENCE TO WHAT HAPPENEDED THE TRAINS DOESN'T EEM LIKE THE BEST WAY OF COMIN THE TURNTS WITH IT AND THEN MORE THAN FORTY MEMBERS OF THE FLYTIME COMMUNITY ASKED THE MODERATOR OF THE FOR IIM TO DO THE KIRK'S POST AND LIKE SO MANY OTHER THINGS IN

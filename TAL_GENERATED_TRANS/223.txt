THE ONES WHO WERE TERRIFIED BY THE MOVY AND THE ONE WHO THOUGHT THOSE KIDS WERE LOSERS THIS LANTED AT MAKING THEIR CASE ON TE VE MAKING THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE SCARED KIDS AND THE BRAVE KIDS EVEN WIDER

DON'T THINKS A LOT AN RECUAR A SR WUTYOUBUT A FEW KIDS DID TALK ABOUT HOW SCARED THEY WERE THE ONE EVERYONE REMEMBERS LITTLE CHANCE THAT HE A WALKD OUT OF QUAST DURING THE MOVING I SAW A HAD TE A AND AND EN MODIN IN AN THAT PER TIN CANE NOWTIN YETLIS AGLY O THE MOVYSCARED YES CHACITY WAS ONE OF THE KIDS ON THE STEPS WITH DAVID THAT DAY IT WAS DIFFERENT FOR HER THOUGH SHE TOLD ME WAS T'T SO MUCH THE MOVY ITSELF THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF IT WAS MORE SCARED FOR MY SOUL I GUESS THIS WAS LIKE THE HEIGHT OF THE SATANIC PANIC AND MY PARENTS WERE LIKE WHOLY ROLLER PEOPLE AND I HAD BEEN TOLD AS A CHILD LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE SATAN COULD KET TO YOU FROM THINGS LIKE MOVIES OR BAD BOOKS CHASCITY ONLY WATCHED A COUPLE MINUTES OF THE MOVY BEFORE SHE BOOKS AT OUT THE CLASSROOM BLESS THAN FIVE SHE WAS SURE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR SATAN I MEAN IT I WAS LITERALLY FRIGHTENED THAT I HAD IN SOME WAY  PARTICIPATED ENOUGH TO WHERE THE DEVIL WOULD COME IN INVADE MY SOUL NOT THE SORT OF KID WHO WANTS TO END UP ON PV BUT ONE AFTERNOON REPORTERS FER IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL INTERVIEWING HER MOB WHO WAS NOT JUST OUTRAGED BUT ALSO THE MM TALKING OF THE NEWS THE MOST ABOUT HER OUTRAGE CHACITYES JUST STANDING THERE NEXT TO HER FEELING EMBARRASSED AND I FELT LIKE EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT ME AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE KIND OF LAUGHING AND STUFF AND I KIND OF STOOD OUT LIKE A SOR ON MANY WAYS CAUSE I WAS THE CHACITY BY THE WAY T WAS THEONLY WHITE KID IN HER GLASS LIKE PALE WITH BLOND HAIR AND BLUE EYE SO I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T JUST JUSTAPPEAR BLONDON EVEN IF I WANTED TO BUT I REMEMBER TALKING TO THE REPORTERS AND I JUST REMEMBER THEM ASKING YOU KNOW HOW DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL OR HOW WAS THE MOVY AND I JUST SAID IT WAS SCARY BTHE KIDS A SCHOOL RAN WITH THAT SHE PASKIDS IN THE HALL AND THEY YELT IT WAS SCARY BEHIND HER AND CHASITY HAD NEVER BEEN ONE OF THE CHOOLEST KIDS TO BEGIN WITH I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS AND MOST PEOPLE WERE NICE TO ME BUT I ALSO WAS VERY INSECURE AT A LOT OF IS SHE'S AT HOME AM AND THEN JUST TOO LIKE PHYSICALLY HOW DIFFERENT I WAS AND EVERYBODY ELSE AND THAN WITH THIS WHOLE SITUATION IT JUST BROUGHT MORE ATTENTION TO ME I FELT LIKE AND I FELT LIKE I WAS BULLIED MORE LIKE I CRIED ABOUT IT FOR SHARE  SOTS LIKE THE LITTLE PRASE THAT HAS GONE DOWN AND INFAMY I GUESS SHE WAS LIKE YOU WAS SCARY LIKE YAT I'M MGAD CAUSE I AM THIRTY FIVE NOW AND I WILL STILL WHEN I RUN IN TO PEOPLE FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OR SOME ONE GETS IN CONTACT WITH ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA THEY'LL STILL SAY THE WHOLE IT WAS SCARY AND IT'S LIKE A KIND OF FILLS LIKE SOMETIMES IF PEOPLE DON'T YEVEN REMEMBER THE WHOLE SITUATION THEY REMEMBER THAT IT WAS SCARRY PART AND THOT WAS LIKE THE SOUND BITE I GUESS CAUSE WHENEVER THEY RAN OUT OF MATERIAL TO KIND TO MAKE FUN OF ME WITHOT IT WOULD REVER BACK TO THAT BECAUSE OF IT WAS SCARRY AND THE FACT THAT HER MAM WAS SO VOCAL ON THE NEWS CHASITY SAYS KIDS AND TEACHERS BLAMED HER FOR SQUEALING TO HER MAM AND FOR BRINGING ALL THIS CHAOS AND NEGATIVE ATTENTION TO THE SCHOOL WHEN CHASITY LOOKS BACK ON ALL THIS THERE'S A WHOLD LIST OF A DOLTS WHO PUT HER IN THE SITUATION HERMAM THE TEAVY REPORTER WHO MADE HER THE POSTER CHILD WIRH THE LOSERS HER PARENTS AND CHURCH WHO TOLD HER THE DEVIL WOULD COME AFTER HER IF SHE SAW MOVY LIKE THIS AND OF COURSE HER TEACHER WHO SHOWED HER THE MOVY THE FOUR TEACHERS WHOD SHOWN THE MOVY WERE ALL REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOL TWO WERE SUBSTITUTES WHO HAD TAKEN OFF THE LISTS OF SABS THE SCHOOL TO CALL THE TWO FULL TIME TEACHERS WERE SUSPENDED FOR TEN DAYS AND THEN REASSIGNED TO OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT INCLUDING DAVID AND CHASTITYES TEACHER THE TEACHERS APOLOGIZED DAVID AN CHASITY'S TEACHERS THAID SHE OWNED THE MOVY BUT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS ON IT THAT'S THE CLOSEST THING I FOUND TO AN EXPLANATION FOR ALL THIS THERE WAS ONE THING THE ADOLTSA SCHOOL DID TO TRY TO MORE DIRECTLY HELP THE KIDS UCH ALSO WHAT A LITTLE WEIRD DAVID REMEMBERS A WOMAN COMING TO HIS CLASS SHE TOLD THEM SHE WAS A GRIEF COUNSILLOR TAT'S LIKE AN INTRODUCTION IT SEDLIC HY YOU'RE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS IF YOU HAVE ANY FEARS TO CONCERNS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M HERE FOR BUS DAVID THOUGHT THAT SOUNDS O QUET  DO HAVE FEARS AND CONCERNS BUT WHEN SHE STARTED THE SESSION HE DIDN'T LIKE HOW SHE STARTED A IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW N LEPRICHON PLEASE COME TO LIKE THE NURSES OFFICE NOW WHATEVER OFFICE THEY YOU KNOW HADISIN AND YOU HAD TO RAISE YOUR HAND AFTER THEY ASKED SO BASICALLY THEY WERE JUST LIKE IS ANYONE HERE SILLAFRA T TA LEPRICHON THING RAISE YOUR HAND IF SO LIKE WHATDID YOU DO TO RAISE YOUR HAND OR LAKE DID YOU O YES LITTLLY STOOD UP AND WALK TO THE NURSES OFFAS AS A GROUP A GROUP OF SAD KIDS AND ALL THE ASHHOLL KIDS WERE JUST LIKE MAKING FUN OF EVERYONE WHO STOOD UP OR RASE HER HANDLIK YOU'RE LESS YOU WET THE BED YOU HAVE BAD DREAMS AK YOU SACK THAT CREDITHING LET ME JUST P OV THE STRUCTRAL FLOW AT THIS PLAN BAT US THE KIDS WHO ARE ALREADY BEIN TEAS TIS ELF IDENTIFY AS WENEES IN FRONT OF THEIR PEERS AND GET MARCHED AWAYS A GROUP ANYWAY THE GRIEF COUNCILLOR SAT THE SIDE KIDS DOWN THER SID LITTLE GROUP SHE STARTS ASKING US QUESTIONS AND THE QUESTIONS ARE PRESUMABLY BASIT GRIEF COUNCILER QUESTIONS WHAT'S YOUR NAME DO YOU FEEL SAFE AT HOME WHAT'S YOUR HOME LIFE LIKE QUESTONS A PROPRIATE FOR KIDS WHER EXPERIENCE IND LOSS OR ABUSE ARE NEGLECT NOT DOES TES SARILY LEOPERCONS PECIFIC AND THEN TIME RAN OUT

THE GRIEF COUNCILLOR AGAIN SHE STARTS ASKING BASIT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND IF YOU FEEL SAFE AND I REMEMBER RAISING MY HAND BEING LIKE ARE WE GOINGTO TALK ABOUT THE LEOPERCON ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO KILL THIS THING BECAUSE IN MY MIND IT WAS A REAL FEAR THE SIX YEAR OLD MES LIKE THIS IS BULSHIT LIKE THIS THIS COUNCER IS NOT WORTH THE DAM SHE'S NOT GIVING US PRACTICAL ADVICE WHY WE WASTING TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON KILLING THE FEUCKING LEOPERCON WHETAND I REMEMBER ASKING THE GRIEF COUNCILLOR SO IF THE LEOPERCON COMS SHE WE JUST BE CARRYING CHANGE WITH US LIKE YOU I NEED O CARRI GOLD TO EXCHANGE MY LIFE BECAUSE THINK THERE'S A SCENE IN THE MOV WHERE THEY DISTRACT THE LEOPERCON BY THROWING COINS IN THE AIR I GUESS THE THE IDEA WAS THAT IF THEY SALK COINS THEY HAD TO COUNT THEM OR PICK THEM OF FOR SOMETHING AND THEY WERE THROWING SHOES BECAUSE THE LEOPERCON WAS LIKE A COBBLER AND AN TO CLEAN SHOES BUT IT WAS THOSE TYPES OF QUESTIONS LIKE DO I DO I NEED HOLY WATER LIKE FOR REAL I NEED SOMEBODY WHAS EDUCATED IN THIS WHO SEEN THE MOVY AND CAN TELL ME THE ACTUAL PRACTICAL RECIPE TO KILLING A LEOPERCON WHAT DIS SHE SAY I REMEMBER LIKE HER BEING KIND OF TAKEN ABACK BY THE QUESTIONS UM AND AND JUST GIVING THE SAME KIND OF STOCK ANSWER F LIKE THIS ISN'T REAL THIS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT U WHICH IS NOT HELPFUL IT FILLED MORE LIKE A THECENTER OF THE POOR BROWN SCHOOL AND MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT DAVID JUST REMEMBER S FEELING LIKE THE MESSAGE WHO IS GETTING FROM A DULTS CEPT BEING LIKE THE PROBLEMIS IN THE MOVY

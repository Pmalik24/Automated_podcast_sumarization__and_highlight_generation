FOR PROTESTORS WHO GET KICKED OUT BY THEIR PARENTS AND NEED A PLACE TO LIVE ALL NEW GREW UP IN HONCONG HE KNOWS A FAMILY THAT IS VERY FAR PART ON THIS THE SON IS A PROTESTER THE DAD IS A RE TIRED

POLICEMAN I KNEW IN REAL LIFE I WAS EXCITED TO TALK TO HIM BECAUSE YOU NEVER HEAR WHAT THE POLICE THINK ABOUT THE PROTESTS POLICE HERE ARE NOT REALLY ALLOWED TO HALK TO THE PRESS PETERS RETIRED BUT

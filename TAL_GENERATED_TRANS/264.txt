FROM PEOPLE WHOVE HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT THEIR ALONENESS ALL THEIR LONELINESS EVEN WHEN THEY 'RE IN A CROWD HOW TO BE IN ASTRONAUT OR A SOLITARY PLANET WHEN THERE'S A WHOLE GALLANT  JUST AROUND THER CORNER HOW TO BE ALONE THAT'S THE FEELING OF TO DAY'S PROGRAM TH BB B EASAT CHICOGO ITS THIS AMERICAN LIFE ON THE NOT Y WOULD ME STAY WITH ME ACTME THE UNBEARABLE BONT WHEN ISOLATION AND SOCIAL DISTANCING WAS STILL NEW I READ A LETA AND IT FELT LIKE PAGES FOM MY DIARY I HADN'T EVEN KNOWN I WAS WRITING IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THIS AWONDER REVIEW BACK IN APRIL THE WRITO DANIEL EVANS A LEARNING BOLTIMAL SEEMES TO SINTHISLIZE THE FEELING OF A LEARNNESS AND LOSS AND FEAR THAT I HADN'T YET BEEN ABLE TO EVEN ALTICULATE HIS DANIEL READING A VERSION OF THAT LETTA WHO WAS EVERY ONE'S LAST REAL HUMAN TOUCH A FRIEND ASKED AT A SUME BIRTHDAY PARTY IN LATE MARCH I CIDA NAME BUT ONCE EVERY ONE HUNG UP I THOUGHT AGAIN NOT SHOR F I REMEMBERED CORRECTLY I WALKED MYSELF THROUGH THAT LAST REAL DAY OF EMEN CONTACT THE FIRST WEEK OF MARCH ON THE LAST DAY OF A W P AND ANNUAL WRITER'S CONFERENCE I HA PLANNED TO FLY TO SAN ANTONIO A DAY AND A HALF EARLY TO TREAT A FRIEND THAT A DIFFICULT YEAR TO A PRECONFERENCE SPAWDAY BUT IN THE DAYS LITTING UP TO THE CONFERENCE FEAR OF THE VIROS SPREAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MY FRIEN CANCELLED THEIR TRAVEL PLANS I CANCELLED THE SPODA OUT OF PRUDENCE BUT MY FLIGHT WAS DEPARTING AS SCHEDLED AND I WOULDN'T GET REINBERSED IF I DIDN'T GET ON IT I DECIDED TO TRAVEL ANXIOUSLY BUT I AM ANXIOUS AS A GENERAL CONDITION ONE WAY TO LIVE IN THE WORLD WHEN YOU HAVE ANXIETY IS TO GET USED TO PUSHING AT ASIDE WHEN IT GETS IN THE WAY OF BEING ALIVE THIS IS MY BEST EXPLANATION FOR WHY I TRUSTED THE CITY AND THE EIR LINES AND THE INSTITUTIONS WHO SAID IT WAS STILL SAFE TO TRAVELE AND IGNORED TE WARNINGS OF FRIENDS WHO SAID WHAT WAS COMING I THOUGHT FLORENTINE WAS STILL IN IT AND WEEKS AWAY IF SO AND I THOUGHT IF LONELINESS WAS COMING SOON I DID NOT WANT TO BE ALONE ANY LONGER THAN NECESSARY THE CONFERENCE WAS PART HEPTIC WORK TRIP PART CARNIVAL ON ITS SFINAL DAY TIRED AFTER TWO DAYS PACKED WITH EVENTS AND PANELS I SLEPT IN AND STAYED IN BED FOR HOURS AFTER I WOKE I FINALLY MADE IT AS FAR AS THE HOTEL LOBBY INTENDING TO GRAB LUNCH BUT INSTEAD SPTTED A FRIEND AT THE BAR WE SPENT A FEW HOURS DAY DRINKING HAVING IN MEYANDURING CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR NOVELS AN MAJOR LIFE DECISIONS E FEEL SO SETTLED I SAID BELIEVING IT THE SARENDIPITY OF THE AFTERNOON BLOOD IN TO THE EVENING I SPENT THE DAY MOVING FROM CROWDED SPACE TO CROWDED SPACE RUNNING INTO FRIENS MAKING PLANS FOR LATER IN THE NIGHT OR THE MONTH OR THE YEAR LATE IN THE EVENING A GROUP OF US HEADED TO THE CONFERENCE'S DANCE PARTY BUT WHEN WE ALL WENT UPSTAIRS THE DANCE FLOOR WAS HILARIOUSLY HEART BREAKINGLY EMPTY IT ALREADY FELT LIKE A MEDAPHOR DOWNSTAIRS PEOPLE BEGAN TO PEEL OFF WE WERE TIRED FIGHTS WERE EARLY IT WAS STARTING TO BE UNAVOIDABLY CLEAR THAT WE WERE IN THE BEFORE OF SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND ON THE WRONG SIDE OF CAUTION I REMEMBER WHO WAS THERE I REMEMBER THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE ALREADY CONSCIENTIOUSLY NOT HUGGING OR TOUCHING THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE THERE WHO I DIDN'T KNOW WELL ENOUGH TO UG WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON WHO LEANED INTO ME TO SAY GOOD BY WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON BESIDES ME TO REALIZE THE PARTY WAS OVER TWO DAYS AFTER I RETURNE TO BALTIMORE THE CANPAS WHERE I TEACH WAS CLOSED IMMEDIATELY AND INDEFINITELY I PREPARED MYSELF FOR THE CITY TO SHUT DOWN FOR ABOUT A MONTH I WALKED A BLOCK TO BUY EXTRA CATFOOD AND THEN A BLOCK MORE TO STOCK UP ON CANND AND DRIED GOODS AND FOR REASONS UNCLEAR TO ME ESSENTIAL OILS AT MY TINY AND MYSTERIOUS NEIGHBOURHOOD HELT FOOD STOR I REAND STATED THE SERVICE THAT MAILED ME A BOX OF VESH VEGETABLES WEEKLY A MONTH PAST THE VIRUS HADN'T PIQUED YET APRIL IN MAY PAST I KEPT WAITING FOR A CLEAR SIGN THAT THE WORST WAS OVER BUT INSTEAD FELT LIKE WE WERE ALL TRAPPED IN THE OPENING HALF OF A HARR MOVY BY THE TIME THE CITYS STAY AT HOME ORDER LIFTED IN EARLY JUNE LITTLE SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGE TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT BEING IN CROWDS OR WRIDING THE CITY BUS OR SHARING IN DOOR SPACE WITH PEOPLE IT'S TOLIE NOW AND MOST WEEKS I ONLY GO AS FAR AS MY APARTMENT BUILDINGS FRONT ENTRY WAY TO COLLECT MAIL AN OCCASIONAL GROCERIES AND BRING THEM INSIDE TO DISAN FACT IN MORE EXCITING WEEKS I VENTURE DOWN THE FIRESCAPE TO TAKE OUT THE RESICLING AND WALK AROUND THE BLOCK TO COME BACK IN THROUGH MY FRONT DOOR THOUGH FOR THREE WEEKS A RECIC LING WAS ON HOLD BECAUSE OF AN OUTBREAK IN THE BUREAU OF SOLID WASTE AND I STELP TO MAKING EVEN THAT SMALL TRIP IN OVER THREE MONTHS I HAVE SEEN SIX DELIVERY PEOPLE TWO NEIGHBOURS IN THE HALLWAY ONE FRIEND MAKING A MASK TO FRONT DOOR GROSERY DROP OFF ONE REPAIR MAN ONE STRANGER ME TO DETOWAR THE PROPERTY AND MY LANDLORD AS TIME PASSES THERE ARE FEWER UNBEARABLE DAYS BUT THEY ARE WORSE WHEN THEY COME I HAD A RUNNING JOKE FOR YEARS ABOUT HOW NONE OF MY SURBIVAL SKILLS WOULD BE USEFUL IN AN APOCCALIPS BUT IT TURNS OUT BEING ANXIOUS AND ALONE IN MY APARTMENT WAIGHING WHICH THINGS I LOVE OR WORTH THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MIGHT HURT ME IS THE ONE NAREO I WAS SOMEWHAT PREPARED FOR AT THE START OF THE YEAR I HAD BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO SPENDING SOME TIME ALONE I WAS ON TEACHING LEAVE FOR THE SPRING SAMUSTER ND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LUXURY TO BE MOSTLY AT HOME FOR A WHILE I LOVE MY APARTMENT I BOUGHT MYSELF A SMART MAKE AND TAUGHT MYSELF TO LIKE IT ANTICIPATING AS SEASON WHEN I WOULD BECOME A CREATURE OF ODD HABITS AN HOURS AND WOULDN'T ON A WALK TO THE JIM AFTER DARK OR IN THE SPRING RAIN I WAS PREPARING TO HIHBERNATE AND NOT MISMUCH NOW I MISS SO MANY THINGS I TAKE RED HIM IN DEEP HILLS AND SOMETIMES HOVER OVER THE FIRE ESCAPE LEDGE STANDING BESIDE THE TRASHCAN TO TRY TO GET SOME SUNLIGHT AND IMAGINE THE LUXURY OF HAVING A BACK YARD I MISS MY FATHER WHO WAS A FORTY MINUTE TRAIN RIGHTE AWAY THE TRAIN FEELS OUT OF THE QUESTION AND I CAN'T ASK MY FATHER WORKING FULL TIME FROM HOME AND RECOVERING FROM MINOR SURGERY TO DRIVE AN HOUR EACH WAY JUST TO VISIT I NEVER LEARNED TO DRIVE SOMETHING I SOMETIMES CONSIDERED A BADGE OF CITY DWELLING HONOR EARLIER IN THE YEAR I TOLD A RELATIVE I DIDN'T NEED TO LEARN TO DRIVE IN BALTIMORE WHEN I LIVE A SHORT WALK FROM PENSTATION AND AT LEAST A DOZEN CITY BUSES STOP WITHIN A BLOCK OF MY APARTMENT IF I HAD A CAR AND A LICONS I THINK NOW I COULD DRIVE TO WAVE AT MY FATHER FROM A SAFE DISTANCE WHEN THE CASUAL RELATIONSHIP I DRIFTED IN TO EARLY IN THE YEAR JUST AS CASUALLY EVAPORATED I TOLD A FRIEND I GUESS WE WERNT THAT SERIOUS ABOUT IT SO IT'S FOR THE BEST NOW THE SCOLDING VOICE IN MY HEAD TELLS ME THAT A PERSON WHO BELIEVED IN CHASING AFTER THINGS WHO DIDN'T THINK IT WAS AS CLEAR AS PEOPLE YTHER WANT TO BE AROUND YOU WHERE THEY DON'T ND IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHICH THERE WAS YOUR ANSWER WELL THAT PERSON MIGHT NOT BE ALONE IN OUR APARTMENT FOR MONTHS WHEN I TURNE THIRTY FIVE A FEW YEARS AGO I PROMISED MYSELF I LET GO OF THE IDEA THAT SOMDAY I WAS GOING TO BECOME A DIFFERENT KIND OF ADULT I LET MYSELF EXCEPT THAT THEY WOULD BE NO HOUSE OR HUSBAND OR BABY OR SUDDEN MATURE REN A SIATION OF GLITTER IT WAS ONLY THE BABY I REALLY GRIEVED BUT I LET MYSELF HAVE THAT GRIEF AND MOVE ON I GAVE MYSELF PERMISSION TO LIVE A LIFE THAT WASN'T WAITING FOR MY REAL LIFE TO START TO FREE ALL OF MY INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS FROM THE EMOTIONAL TYRANNY OF A TICKING BIOLOGICAL CLOCK TO CLAIM IS A CHOICE BUT WHAT OTHERWISE FEEL LIKE IT HAD HAPPENED TO ME I THOUGHT IT WORKED BUT THE LONELINESS OF ISOLATIONS SOME DAYS MOXALE OF THAT MAKES ALL OF MY POSSIBLE JOYS FEEL A FEMERAL I ASK WISH OF THE THINGS I PROMISED MYSELF I COULD STILL HAVE CASUAL FLINGS TRAVEL COMMUNITY IN THE FORM OF CLASSUMES AND BOOKSTORES AND COFFEE SHOPS AND BARS WILL SURVIVE THIS OR EXISTIN RECOGNIZABLE FORM WHEN WE EMERGE IT IS POSSIBLE TO FEEL STOCK WITH YOUR CHOICES EVEN WITHOUT WISHING YE'D MADE ANY DIFFERENTLY WHEN I HEAR THAT THIS COULD GO ON FOR A YEAR I THINK IT IS LACK OF HUMAN TOUCH HUMAN CONTACT THAT WILL BREAK ME AND THEN I THINK IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GRIEF WITHOUT THE CONSTANT BUSY BUZZ OF MY NORMAL LIFE IT'S HARDER NOT TO DWELL IN WHAT IS ABSENT THE LIVES I MIGHT HAVE HAD THE LIFE I WOULD HAVE TIS MY MOTHER WERE STILL ALIVE I KEEP WAITING FOR THE FIRST FEELING I HAVE THAT IS WHOLLY UNTOUCHED BY GRIEF OR THAT IS AT LEAST ITS OWN FRESH GRIEF NOT MARKED BY HER DEATH THREE YEARS AGO BUT IT HASN'T COME YET WHEN I HEARD THE EARLY DESCRIPTIONS OF THE VIRIS OF WHAT IT DOES TO PEOPLE'S BREATHING I THOUGHT OF MY MOTHER AT THE BEGINNING OF HER ILLNESS WHEN SHE WENT TO THE YARE WITH UNDIIG NO STAGE FOR A CANCER AND A LEADER AND A HALF OF FLUID IN HER LUNGS ND THE DOCTOR WAS PLAYING TO SEND HER HOME WITH A LACIIVE UNSI MY MOTHER'S FRIEND A CAIOLOGE TO THE SAME HOSPITAL INSISTED THEY GIVE HER A CATS GAN I THOUGHT OF MY MOTHER AT THE END WHEN EVERYTHING THEY'D GIVEN HER TO KEEP THE PAIN AT BAY TO KEEP HER UNNOTRULY CALM WHILE HER BODIES EVERY INSTINCT TOLD HER TO PANIC ALSO MEANT SHE COUN HOLD ER HAD UP TO COSGH OR VOMIT HOW MANY TIMES SHED SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DE HO UP TO TUBES SO WHEN THEY FIRST AFKED TO INTUBATE HER HER PARTNUR SAID NO HOW WHEN I WAS ALONE WITH HER LATER THAT DAY SHE BEGAN TO CHOKE SADDNLY AWAKE AND TERRIFIED AND I HELD HER HAND I PUSHE THE CALLBUTTON AN KNEW WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME SO I RAN INTO THE HALLWAY SCREAMING FOR HELP AN THE NURSE CAME RUNNING I STOOD IN THAT HALLWAY TERRIFIED MY MOTHER WAS GOING TO DIE WHILE I WAS IN FACT AT THE HOSPITAL BY HER BEDSIDE WAITING FOR MY MOTHER TO DIE JUST NOT LIKE THAT HOW I DIDN'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN UNTIL AFTER THEYD WUTH THE TUBAN THAT HAD HEARD HER VOICE FOR THE LAST TIME IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF CUORENTINE SOMETIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY I WOULD FIND MYSELF SOBBING AND ONLY REALIZED LATER WY WHICH BIT OF NEWS TRIGERED WHICH MEMORY THE DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT THE VIRISS DOES TO THE BODY HOW MANY OF THE EARLY FACES OF THE DEAD WERE BLACK WOMEN MY MOTHER'S AGE OR THE INFURIATING FINANCIAL POLITICS OF OUR HEALSECARE SISTEM IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO UNTANGL ON A PERSONAL OR NATIONAL LEVEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HEALTH CRISIS AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WHEN MY MOTHER'S CATSCAN CAME BACK INDICATING A PROBLEM BEFORE I COULD COMFORT HER I HAD TO ASK HER FOR HER INSURANCE CARD AND STEP OUT IN THE HALLWAY TO CALL IN A PAIMENT BECAUSE I KNEW IF SHE GOT ANY FURTHER BEHIND SHE WOULD BE UNINSURED I KNEW THAT BECAUSE WE'D FOUGHT THE WEEK BEFORE WHEN SHE TOLD ME SHE'D STOP PAYING HER INSURANCE SHE SAID THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH ME IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND THE ONLY REASON FOR THAT DISTRESS AND THE MAIN REASON I'M STREST IS MONEY I SIDE OF THERE SOMETHING ELSE WRONG BY THE TIME YOU KNOW IT IT WILL BE TOO LATE IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE WHEN THE VIRUS FIRST HIT I THOUGHT OF WHAT HALLOT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR MY SICK MOTHER AFTER YEARS OF KEMO AND COMPLICATIONS TO HAVE TO ADT OF PANDEMIC TO HER LIST OF DANGERS I HAD THE UNBEARABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A GOOD THINGS SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH THIS AS TIME PASSED I THOUGHT MORE OF MY MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS WELL MY MOTHER WHO WOULD HAVE MADE IT MADE ME TWO WEEKS BEFORE CALLING TO TELL ME SHE WAS COMING TO GET ME IF SHE WAS COMING TO DAY BUT SHE WASN'T LETTING ME STAY IN MY APARTMENT ALONE FOR MONTHS WHAT IT'S MY APARTMENT I WOULD HAVE SAID AND SHE WOULD HAVE SCOFFED AT MY BOUNDARY IS IN COMM ANYWAY WHAT I'VE BEEN FEELING ACUTELY IS THE PARTICULAR ABSENCE OF THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO LEAVE ME ALONE EVEN WHEN I ABSOLUTELY WANTED TO BE WHEN I CAN STEP OUT OF MY PERSONAL GRIEF FOR LONG ENOUGH I SUMEMONE MY MOTHER'S TENACITY IN THE FACE OF THE MORE COLLECTIVE GRIEF WHEN THE DATA ON RACE BEGAN TO COME IN IT WAS NOT A SURPRISE BUT IT WAS DEVASTATING AND ALSO TERRIFYING WHEN I SAW WHO WAS DYING AND I HEARD THE NARRATIVE SHIFT TO PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY I LOST ALL FAITH THAT WE WOULD TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY ENOUGH FOR LONG ENOUGH I KNEW MY COUNTRY I THOUGHT AND I WAS AFRAID THAT ONCE AT THOUGHT THIS WAS A BLACKEN BROWN PROBLEM IT WOULD NOT BLANK AT SACRIFICING GIG WORKERS AND SHIPPING PLANTWORKERS AND SERVICE WORKERS AND FOOD WORKERS AND CITY EMPLOYES TO HAVE BACK THE WORLD OF MONEY AND PARTIES IT WOULD KILL THEM AND REPLACE THEM FOR AS LONG AS IT NEEDED TO EVEN ONCE THE COLOR OF THE FACES STARTED TO CHANGE FOR MONTHS I FELT LIKE MY FEAR THAT BLACK LIFE WASN'T WORTH MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY WAS ANOTHER FORM OF A LONENESS WHICH AS WHY THE SHOCK OF JUNE'S PROTEST AND THE DEATHS THAT MADE THEM NECESSARY FELT LIKE HORROR AND HOPE AT ONCE WLIKE WE COULD SAY WHATD HAD CLEARLY BEEN TRUE ALL ALONG EVEN IF WE COULDN'T YET SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD CHANGE STILL I AM TERRIFIED OF GETTING SICK BECAUSE BEING SICK ALONE MEANS IT MAY BE TOO LATE WHEN I REALIZE HOU SICK I AM I AM TERRIFIED OF HAVING TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL ALONE BECAUSE EVERYTHING I KNOW SAYS THERE'S NO POINT GOING TO THE HOSPITAL IF I'M NOT WELL ENOUGH TO QUEDENTIAL MYSELF I DO NOT HAVE ANY PARTICULAR HEALTH RUST FACTORS FOR THIS VIRUS EXCEPT THAT I FIND DOCTORS TRESTFUL AND MY BLOOD PRESSURE SPIKES THE BEGINNING OF ANY DOCTORS VISIT IF THE DOCTOR IS WILLING TO YUMOR ME AND TAKE IT AGAIN MY BLOOD PRESSRE IS ALMOST ALWAYS NORMAL AND THE FILSOS I HAVE ANXIETY IF THE DOCTOR WAS NOT F THE VISIT WAS UPSETTING THAND THE FILES HAS MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS ELEVATED MYLE HY PRETENSION IF I GOT SICK NO ONE WOULD SAY SHE IS A PROFESSOR WHO JUST ACHIEVED A PELETON MILESTONE AND HAS A REFRIGERATIVE FILLAMAN MILK AND FRESH VEGETABLES IN THE BOOK OUT SOON AND SHE CLARKS LIKE THE APARTMENTS FRONT OORS EVERY TIME SHE WENT TO GET THE MALE SOMEONE WOULD SAY HI PRETENSION SOME ONE WOULD SAY COME RABIDITY SOME ONE WOULD READ THE SUMMARISE TATISTICS AND SAY THOT ONE DOESN'T COUNT SHE WAS BASICALLY DEAD ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE GAME WE ARE PLAYING WITH LANGUAGE ONE WHERE I AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY CANNOT COUNT AS DYING OF THIS BECAUSE WE ARE ALREADY NOT ALIVE WHEN I THINK THIS IT IS NOT A SPECIALLY GOOD FOR MY BLOOD PRESSURE I ADD SPITE TO MY REASONS TO STAY ALIVE AND WELL I GREET MY ANXIETY LIKE AN OLD FRIEND ONE WHO WANTS ME TO LIVE ALONG LIFE AND FORGIVES ME WHEN I DOUBT HER I ALTERNATE WIH SHE MI PAPPY SMART BIK AND THE DESPAIR OF TWITTER I WHALT OUR NEW BOOKS TO LOCAL BOOKSTORES BEFORE I'E FINISHED THE LAST BATCH I DON'T IT WHAT I CAN WHERE I CAN WORK MY WAY TO THE LOCAL TIPCARBENMO LOOKING FOR MY BAR TENDERS AND BARICEDAS IN MAY HAIR DRESSER I TALK TO MY FATHER SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK AND RECENT YEARS HE

ALL THE LAWYERS I TALK TO AND THEY REPRESENT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE FAMILY IN THESE FACILITIES THEY TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY ONE WHO AGREED TO SEPARATE BETTER TO BE ALONE TOGETHER AT LEAST THIS WAS A LONELINESS THEY KNEW BNADIE RAYMON IS ONE OF THE PRODUCES OF VASHIM A THE HANDR IN HIS MAMAN DID FINETY GET RELEASD SEVEN WEEKS AGO BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JUDGES OLDER A THE HANRER HAD TO HAVE HIS APPENDEXOUNT AND THEY COULDN'T CARE FOR HIM AT THE FACILITY THE JUDGE HAS EXTENDED THE DEAD LINE FOR ICE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED LONGER THAN TWENTY DAYS ICE HASN'NTIL THE END OF THE MONTH WE'VE ARRIVED AT ACT FOOL A PLIED BUB STUDIES CANWE TAKE A MOMENT TO REVIEW SOME OF THE NEGATIVE CONNITATIONS THE WOOD ISOLATION BRINGS UP THINK OF THE PENDLTY BOOKS OL SOLITRY CAN FINMENT BUT WHAT OF THAT ISOLATION IS A CHOICE YOU MAKE THOS THAT ALONENESS FEEL LIKE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT I SPOKE TO SOME ONE WITH AN IDEA OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION MARSA SUNDAY ELLEN THE STORY BEGINS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SANDY WAS LIVING IN BROOKLYN WITH AN INCREASING FEELING THAT THEY WONTESOLIV CLOSI TONATION IT WASN'T THT THY FOOLIN OUT OF LOVE WOULD CITIES THIS WAS LESS ABOUT RUNNING AWAY THAN IT WAS ABOUT ACTIVELY RUNNING TOOLD SOMETHING SOMETHING GREEN AND LUSH ON ON TOP OF THAT SANDY WAS BEGINNING TO COME OUT AS NON BINERY I THINK I WAS AM JUST STARTING TO PLAY WITH SUCH THINGS AS DRESSING A LITTLE MORE ENDROGENOUSLY AND LEAVING THE HOUSE AND OR GOING TO A A A BARBER SHOP FOR MAN AND AND GETTING A A HAIRCUT THERE AND TRYING TO KIND OF LIKE VIOLATE THAT TABOO AND NOT FEEL TO WEARD IF ALL THESE MEN WERE STARING AT ME AS I GOT A HAIR CUT IN THOSE MONTHS OF CHANGE THEY'D BEGUN TO NOTISE HOW THEIR VERY APPARANTS SEEMED TO MAKE THE AD CHARGED I HAD SHIFTED FROM A PEERING LIKE A CERTAIN THING IN PUBLIC WHICH WAS LIKE A WHITE WOMAN TO APPEARING LIKE THIS OTHER THING WHICH WAS THIS WHITE I DON'T KNOW LIKE A ARE YOU A JED OR WHAT A IM AND I WAS I THINK ALL OF THE TIME BECOMING MORE AND MORE AWARE OF EVERYBODY WHO SAW ME AND WHAT ID I LOOK LIKE TO THEM AND HOW MUCH OF A THREAT WAS A RANDUM WOMAN IN A WOMAN'S ROOM GOING TO BE TO ME I'M WAS I GOING TO GET WERD LOOKS WAS I GOING TO GET YELLD AT WAS I GOING TO GET YOU KNOW HOSTILE COMMENT MATTERED AT ME AND LIKE I MUST SENSITIVE FLOUR I A VERY I I I I REALLY I I I DON'T KNOW I'M VERY I SENSITIVE TO PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS AND SO I THINK THERE WAS A SENSE OF IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WISER FOR ME TO CUT DOWN ON THE VOLUME OF INTERACTIONS THAT I HAVE WITH STRANGERS BUT SANDY HAD AT THEY THINKATIVES AND EXAMPLE OF HOW TO HANDLED THE SITUATION THEIR UNCLE BOB AT SOME POINT HEEDLES HA DECIDED THAT THE VOLUME OF INTIRECTIONS IN HIS LIFE WAS WAY TO BIG AND HE TOOK DECISIVE RATICOLECTION HE MOVED A FEW HOURS AWAY FROM WAY HE'D GROWN UP IN THE BAYARIA TO SOME WHAT FATHER OP NOS THE PLACE MOSTLY FREE ABOVE THE HUMANS SANDY HAD KNOWN BOB AS A SORT OF WAITO IGIN HE LIVED A MOSTLY SOLITRY EXISTENCE SOMETIMES THEY'D SEE HIM A CHRISTMAS OR AT THE GRANDFATHER'S VACATION HIM IN NOWTHEN MINISERTO BOB LACK TO HAVE LONG CONVERSATIONS SOMETIMES HE'D LEAVE LONG RAMBLING MESSAGES IN SANDY'S FAMILIES ONSERY MACHINE PLAYING HIS MUSIC OF COMEDYSCATES GROWING UP SANDY DIDN'T SEE BOB AS THE KINDRED SPIRITS IN A FAMILY THAT DIDN'T TALK DIRECTLY ABOUT THINGS BOB WAS AN INCOMPLYTE PATON AND EXAMPLE OF FALA AS A TEANAJA BOB HAD BEEN GIVEN THE SLYCIATRIC DIKE NESES OF SCIDSIFRENIA AND WAS REPEATEDLY HOSPITALIZED AND PRESCRIBED ANTO CYCONTIC MIDICATION SOMETIMES AGAINST HIS WILL IN FAMILY LUL HE WAS KIND OF THIS TROUBLED GUY HO GOT KICKED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN BOUNCED BETWEEN SLICE HOSPITALS AND FRIEND'S COUCHES SANDY AND BOB WONT CLOS AND THEN ONE DAY IN TWO THOUSAND A NINE JUST AS SANDY HAD STALTED GRADSCHOOL IN IOWE THEY GOT A PACKAGE IN THE MAL BOB HAD WRITTEN HIS OLD ABIOGRAPHY AND SENT IT TO THEM I INITIALLY GOT THIS TAXT IN THE MAL FROM MY HERMIT UNCLE THAT WAS LIKE TYPED IN ALL CAPS ON A TYPEWRITER AND LIKE SIXTY PAGES IN A HAT LIKE SWEAR WORDS AND SLURS AND I WAS A MASS AND T WAS YOU KNOW I WAS JUST LIKE WHAT IS THIS I DON'T CONFESS YOU KNOW AND I AT THE TIME I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT O HA THIS GUY MY LIKE AS I WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM WAY BACK MY CRAZY UNCLE BOB MY CRAZY UNCLE BOB AND ME WE ARE AS FAR APART AS TWO PEOPLE CAN BE YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IN MY HEART HERE I AM I'M LIKE I AM A SCHOLASTIC A CHIEFER AND HERE IS UNCLE BOB WHO LIKE LIVES IN THE DESERT AND I'VE BEEN TO HIS HOUSE ONCE AND IT WAS FULL OF CIGARETTE SMOKE AND BIPBLES AND YOU KNOW ATV THAT HE HADN'T TURNED OFF AN DECATES AND I CANA GOT OUT OF THERE AND WAS LIKE ALL RIGHT I DON'T REALLY NEED TO KNOW THAT GUY BUT THEN SANDY GOT TO READING THE MANUSCRIPT AND THEY DIDN'T JUST READ IT THEY DOVE INTO IT TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHO BOBBOLS EVEN STOUGHTED WRITING A BOOK ABOUT HIM AND THEY DISCOVERED SOMETHING BOB HAD SOLVED FOR HIMSELF A PROBLEM THAT HIS MENTAL HELTH PROFESSIONALS AND THE WORLD IN GENERAL HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO BOB HAD MANAGED TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST VERSION OF HIS LIFE LIVING ALONE FAR AWAY FROM THE CRUSH OF PEOPLE ANDSANDY FOUND THAT BOB WAS MOSTLY CONTENS AND I SAW THAT AS A MODEL FOR LIKE O HAY YOU'VE REALIZED YOUR INCOMPATIBLE WITH SOCIETY AT LARGE PERHAPS WHAT YOU DO I WAS LIKE ALL I KIND OF HAVELA A GUIDE BOOK HERE SO THEY TOOK BOB'S EXAMPLE AND MOVED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SANDY AND TABL FRIEND NOW HUSBANDS TEAVE UP STATE TO THE CAT'SKILLS THEY WONT UNDAT ANY ROMANTIC ILLUSIONS ABOUT COUNTRY LIVING S LIKE IF I GO TO A GROCERY STORE OR I GO TO THE POST OFFICE AND OLD MAN WOULD STARE AT ME THE WHOLE TIME I GROTRY SHOBD OR LIKE LITTLE KIDS WOULD DEBATE WHAT GENDER I WAS IN FRONT OF YOU KNOWN A MEAN LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF COULD HAPPEN HERE JUST AS WELL AS IT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE I'M AND THERE ISN'T REALLY ANYWHERE WHERE I THINK I FEEL ENTIRELY SAFE OTHER THAN MY HOUSE WHJUST WHY I LIKE MY HOUSE SO MUCH TELL ME ABOUT YOU SETS SUP THIN SO HOW HOW ISOLATED IS LIFE UP THERE REALLY SO WHEN WHEN WE MOVED HERE WHERE I SIT ON MY FRONT PORCH YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE ANOTHER HUMAN DWELLING LIKE IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE MY NEIGHBOURS ARE TREES AND TREES AND TREES AND TREES IT'S JUST IT'S ASTONISHINGLY BEAUTIFUL IN LIKE A MILLION WAYS EVERY DAY I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT IS MENTAL HEALTH GAR BEFOR CIVED NINETEEN SANDY'S HUSBAND

FRIENDS BOB BUILD A SYTEM FOR HIMSELF WHAT HE INTERRECTED WITH PEOPLE BUT NOT SO MANY AND  NOT SO MUCH THAT IT BECAME UNWONTED NOISE IN HIS HEAD IT WAS ONLY AS ALONE AS HE NEEDED TO BE IT SOUNDS OUT BUB A MAN WHO PROUDLY COLD HIMSELF AHOMET LIVING ONLY WITH HIS TWO DOGS WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING OF A SOCIAL SAVENT I THINK IN BOB'S SPECIFIC CASE IT TOTALLY SURPRISED ME I GOT ON THE PHONE WITH EVERY PERSON WHO HAD KNOWN HIM IF I COULD POSSIBLY FIND WHO WOULD TALK TO ME AND I'M EVERYBODY WHO I FOUND LIKE EVERYBODY I SPOKE WITH WAS LIKE YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IT BOB YOU TOK ALL ALL THE TIME BOB WOULDS STAY AND TOUCH AND I WAS KIND OF LIKE ISN'T THAT FUNNY HOW ENORM HERE SEEMS TO BE IF YOU'RE PHYSICALLY ISOLATED YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CUT OFF FROM PEOPLE AND I THINK BOB IF ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE LIFE HE'D LED AND ALL OF THE WAYS IN WHICH I THINK HE WAS A A A LONELY PERSON HE WAS ACTUALLY I THINK REALLY A DEPT AT OVERCOMING MAYBY THAT LITTLE VOICEINCS LIKE YOUR HEAD THAT SAYS I DON'T REACH OUT YOU KNOW LIKE DON'T DO THAT THAT WOULD BE WEIRD OR WHATEVER LIKE BOB WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT HE WAS CALLING PEOPLE AND THINK IT'S FORCED ME IN A WAY AND I DON'T KNOW NOT REALLY ACCEPT PHYSICAL ISOLATION AS AN EXCUSE FOR BEING DISCONNECTED I TRY TO TALL MYSELF LIKE HAY DON'T JUST STOP TALKING TO PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU LIVE OUT HERE LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO INVESTAN SANDY WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO BE LEN AND HOW TO DO IT COMFORTABLY AN THE WAS TO JUST HANG OUT WITH THEMSELF AND BOB PROVIDED A MODEL HIS BIG THREE TENETS WAT CREATIVITY COMMUNITY AND SPIRITUALITY BOB WAS LIKE THIS

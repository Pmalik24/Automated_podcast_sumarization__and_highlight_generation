LIFE OR OUR CLAST S THER WETH US AGUAN GOOD BY STRANGER SO LEKE I SAID TO THE TOP THE PROGRAM TO DAY SHOW WAS FIRST BROADCAST IN NOVEMBER AND WE ARE RERUNNING IT TODAY BECAUSE A JUST ON THE POLIT SURPRIZE THIS IS ONE OF THE SPOTSWHERE IM JUMPING INTO THE ORIGINAL BROADCAST TO SAY A THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES AT THE BORDER HAVE ONLY INTENSIFIED SINCE WE FIRST BROUGHTCASTA CHELL SINCE COVERD NINETEEN IN MARCH THE ADMINISTRATION SHUT DOWN THE BORDER TO ALL ASYLUM SEEKERS ASIT I'M HEARINGS AREN'T GOING TO RESUME UNTIL LATE JUNE THOUGH SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT EVEN THAT DATE IS GOIN TO GET PUSHED BACK WY FIRST BRARCAST A THIS PROGRAMP ONE OF T THING THAT WE WERE SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WAS THE UESS OFFICIALS ON THE FRONT LINES WHOS JOB UNDE REMAIN IN MEXICO IS TO SEND  PEOPLE BACK LOT'S OF THEM WERE RESIGNING SING NOW THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT MY JOB OSANTIALS TIMES REPORTER MALIO TOOL TALK TO A BUNCH OF THEM AND HERE IS THE RISION OF THE STORY THAT WE RAN IN THE FALL BEFORE THE REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY BEGAN AND UP ENDED THE ASYLUM SYSTEM AND COMPLETELY CHANGE WHAT IT IS TO BE AN ASYLUM OFFICER HERE'S ALL THE OB USED TO WORK WHEN AE CENTRAL AMERICAN SHOWED UP AT THE US MAXCO BORDER AND SAID LET ME IN I'M AFRAID OF GOING BACK TO MY COUNTRY THAT'S WHERE THE ASYLUM OFFICER CAME IN THE OFFICER DID SOMETHING CALLED A CREDIBLE FIERCE SCREENING TO CHECK IF THE PERSON WAS LIKELY TO FACE HARM OR DEATH IF THE US SENT THEM BACK HOME IF THERE'S EVEN A CHANCE THAT THEY WOULD THE ASYLUM OFFICER WOULD LET THEM INTO THE UNITED STATES TO WAIT FOR A COURT DATE WERE AN EMIGRATION JUDGE WOULD MAKE THE FINUM CALL DUG STEVENS SAYS PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HARD THE JOB IS AT THE TIME ALL THIS STARTED HE WAS AN ASYLUM OFFICER IN SAM FOR SISCO SI'D HAVE PEOPLE COME TO MY OFFICE AND WY JOB A SENTUALLY IS TELL ME THE WORST THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPEN TO YOU HAVE AN HOUR GO AND THAT ALL THE SID OF RO TOIME OF THE TRUTH AND ALL THESIDE OF HOU JUSTIC YOU ARE EXPECTED TO BE OR REALY TO DO THE JOB WELL NEED TO BE AN EXPERT AN THE POLITICAL CULTRAL SOTURAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATIONS IN HE NUERAL COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND YOUR EXPECTED TO BE A HUMAN WI DETECTOR ALL AT ONCE PRESENT TRUMPTOKSPOT ASYLUM ITSELF AS IF IT'S FRAUD HE SAYS IT'S A HOAX A BIG FAT CONJOB THET PEOPLE COME IN WITH FAKE ASYLUM CLAIMS THAT ASYLUM OFFICERS JUST LET EVERYONE THROUGH AND THEN ASYLUM SEKERS NEVER SHOW UP FOR THEIR DAY IN COURT THAT IT'S A BORDER WIDE TWO THOUSAND MILE LOOPHOLL AND IT'S TRUE THEN MOST PEOPLE DO PASS THAT FOR A STAP WITH AN ASYLUM OFFICER AND ENTER THE UNITED STATES BUT TER'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT IT'S BUILTIN DO U S ASYLUM LAW A COMMON SENSE HUMANITARIAN IDEA WE DON'T WANT TO SEND PEOPLE BACK TO SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'D GET TORTURED OR KILL THE LEGAL TERM AS NON REFALUMENT AND SO U S LAW SET THE BAR LAW IF THERES BASICALLY ANY CHANCE AN ASYLUM SEKER COULD GET KILLED OR HARMED THE OFFICERS PAS TO LET THEM INTO THE US AND DOESN'T NEED A LOT OF PROOF OR EVIDENCE AT THAT POINT LATER WHEN THEY GET BEFORE AN EMIGRATION JUDGE AND BY THE WAY THE MAJORITY DO SHO AB THERE THEY NEED PROOF AND MOST OF THEM GET REJECTED EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUM TOOK OFFIC LESS THAN FIFTEEN PER CENT PER YEAR GOT ASYLUM THAT'S BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T MEET THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA IN THE LAW OR DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE OR IT DOESN'T CHECK OUT ALL THE ASYLUM OFFICERS I'VE EVER SPOKEN WITH SEE IT AS THEIR JOB TO WEAT OUT THE FAKERS THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T REALLY NEED PROTECTION THE ONE WHORE JUST TRYING TO GAIN THE SYSTEM OH MI GOD LIKE HERES WHERE I'M GING TO BE REAL WITH YOU THIS IS AN ASYLUM OFFICER WEARE CALLING ERSULA THIS ISN'T HER VOICE SHE'S AFRAID OF GETTING FIRED SO WE HAD AN ACTOR COPY WHAT SHE SAID AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE THE FRID HAP IS LIKE HAPPENING ON A SKALED THATS THAT'S HUGE WE'RE TALKING LIKE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE A MONTH I INTERVIEWED THREE ASYLUM OFFICERS FOR THIS STORY AND ALL THREE SAID THE GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY TARGET OF PRESIDENT TRUMPS EMIGRATION POLICIES THEY ACTUALLY AREN'T THE MAIN ONES COMMITTING FRAUD IT'S NOT THE CENTRAL AMERICANS IT'S NOT THE MIDDALE EASTERN PEOPLE IT IS THE INDIAN PEOPLE AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME BULSHIT'S STORY ABOUT GETTING BEATEN WITH HAKY STICKS THREE TIMES BECAUSE THEIR PART OF IS SEEK PARTY AND THE POLICE TOLD THEM THEY'RE GOING TO JAIL THEM IF THEY EVER BADMOUTH THE RULING PARTY EVER AGAIN BULSHIT JUST HAP THEY ALL JUST HAPPEN TO DO THE S AME THING AND SUFFER THE SAME FATE EVEN THOUGH THEREIS ABSOLUTELY NO CONFIRMATION IN ANY MEDIA THAT ANY OF THIS PERSECUTION IS HAPPENING AND STUDYES DONE BY OUR OUR DEPARTMENT IN ST A COUNTERPARTS IN THE COUNTRY AR STRAIGHT UP LIKE THIS IS NOT A REAL THING THE CHINESE OUR RUNNING AS SIMILAR SCAM WITH CHRISTIAN CLAIMS IN THE FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ASYLUM OFFICERS STARTED HERING ABOUT THESE BIG CHANGES COMING THE POLICY THAT WAS FIRST CALLED REMAIN IN MEXICO AND THEN LATER MIGAM PROTECTION PROTOCALS M P P BUT THE ASYLUM OFFICERS WHO WERE GOING TO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS THING THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THE DETAILS OF HOW THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IT IT WAS ALL SHROUDED IN SO MUCH SECRECY THIS IS ANOTHER ASYLUM OFFICER WE'RE CALLING HER ANN WE USED AN ACTOR HERE TOO TO PROTECT HER IDENTITY OVR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND STARTS PICKING UP AROUND THE OFFICE THAT SOME OF HER COLLEAGUES WERE BEING CALLED IN QUIETLY AND ASK TO GO TO THE BORDER IN SANTDIEGO AND INSTEAD OF THE CREDIBLE FEER SCREENINGS THEY'D ALWAYS DONE THEY SEEMED TO BE DOING SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT UNDER M P P A WHOLE NEW KIND OF INTERVIEW WITH DIFFERENT RULES SHE KNEW SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO START DOING THEM TOO SO SHE PULLED ASIDE A CO WORKER WHO'D ALREADY BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER I WAS ASKING HER HEY LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TRAINING LIKE WHAT IS THIS AND SHE WAS LIKE I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO ABOUT IT ANOTHER ASYLUM OFF GA IS EONE WHO YOUD LIKE CONSIDER A FRIEND ERE A SORTER LIKE PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUE GOOD COLLEAGUE A GOOD COLLEAGUE SOME ONE THAT WE HAD MUTUAL TRUST FOR SURE AND THEN WAS TOLD WAS BROUGHT IN BY A SUPERVISOR FOR LIKE A SPECIAL BRIEF ABOUT ABOUT IT BEFORE I WAS GOING TO START DOING THESE INTERVIEWS AND WAS TOLD HERE'S THE SKINNY ON IT AND DON'T TELL ANYONE WHY BECAUSE I THINK THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS LEGALLY DUBIOS AND SUSPECT AND THEY WANTED TO KEEP THETHE THE LEAK TO AMINIMUM THE LEAK BEING A MAJOR POLLICY ROLL OUT THAT WAS CAN A CHANGE ASYLUM YEH THAT'S THE LEAKE THAT'S THE LEAK YET TWO MONTHS GO BY BEFORE THEY DO A FORMAL TRAINING SESSION WITH THE FULL ASYLUM CORN ND IT'S JUST A POWER POINT HERE'S EIR ASILA AGAIN HANDS WERE GOING UP AND BEING LIKE WE HOW IS THIS LEGAL OR HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE DOING THIS AND HOW DO WE KNOW HOW THIS WORKS ALL THREE OF THEASYLUM OFFICERS I TALKE TO SAID THAT THE PRESENTATION LEFT THEM WITH LOTS OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING THE BIGGEST ON HOW WAS THIS LEGAL THESE OFFICERS KNEW BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY ONE HOW DANGEROUS MEXICO IS ND THIS POLICY SEEMED DESIGN TO SEND TONS OF PEOPLE BACK TO MEXICO IT SEEMD TO BE IN DIRECT CONTRA DICTION WITH YOU WAS ASYLUM LAW WHICH SAYS THAT AT THE VERY LEAST WE CAN'T SEND PEOPLE BACK TO A SITUATION WHERE THEY'D GET HARMED OR KILLED WE CAN'T VIOLATE THE PRINCIPAL OF NON REFALMENT AND THE RESPONSE WAS LIKE I'M JUST THE MESSENGER BRINGING THIS DOWN FROM H KEW AND THIS IS THE POWER POINT THEY GAVE US I WAS LIKE WELL IF YOU DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT DOUBLE CHECKING THAT THIS IS LEGAL AND YOU'RE JUST THE MESSENGER AS YOU SAY YOU'RE AFUCKAN ASHOL YOU KNOW ALL THREE OFFICERS SAY THEY RAISED CONCERNS AND GOT ROUGHLY THE SAME RESPONSE JUST GET OUT THERE AND DO YOUR JOB WUT THEY FOUND OUT SOON ENOUGH WAS JUST HOW RADICAL A CHANGE THE NEW EM P P INTERVIEWS WERE FROM THE OLD CREDIBLE FIER SCREENINGS FOR STARTERS NOT EVERYONE WOULD GET AN INTERVIEW ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTEERED THAT THEY WERE SCARED TO GO BACK TO MEXICO WOULD IF THEY GOT AN INTERVIEW UNDER M P P ASLUM SEEKERS WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY'D BE HARMED IN MEXICO NOT THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND NOT JUS ANY HARM THEY CAN'T JUST BE THREATENED BY GANGS OR THE POLICE THEY HAVE TO BE THREATENED BY GANGS OR POLICE OR WHOEVER BECAUSE OF SOME VERY SPECIFIC REASONS LAID OUT INY ASLAW BECAUSE OF THEIR NATIONALITY RACE RELIGION POLITICS OR BEING PART OF A PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP LIKE I'LL G B TTIO AND THEY'D HAVE TO SHOW THAT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT LIKE A COP OR AN OFFICIAL WAS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROTECT THEM AND THE ASLUM SEKER COULDN'T JUST SAY ALL THIS HAPPENE LIKE THEY COULD UNDER CREDIBLE FEAR SCREENINGS NOW THEY NEED TO PROVE IT IT'S LIKE AS ASYLUM SEEKERS WERE TRAVELLING THROUGH MEXICO FLEING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GATHERING EVIDENCE OF ALL THE SCREWED UP THINGS HAPPENING TO THEM THERE MAKING A PAPER TRAIL AND THEY SHOUL HAVE HAD ALL THIS EVIDENCE ON THE RIGHT THEN RIGHT AFTER CROSSING THE BORDER WHICH OF COURSE HIS NEXT IMPOSSIBLE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY HAD NO IDEA ANY OF THIS WAS REQUIRED DUG SAW ALL THIS HAPPENING AND WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH ID S WE TRIED TO KEEP HIS HEAD DOWN TO TRY AND AVOID HAVING TO DO THESE INTERVIEWS HOPING THE COURTS WOULD KILL AM P P BUT THEY DIDN'T BY JUNE M P P RETURNS HAD SKY ROCKETED AND IT WAS ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR THE ASYLUM CORE DUG COULDN'T DODGE IT ANY MORE AND I DON'T TEMO IT SAID YOURE DOING EM P P INTERVIEWS TO TAY SO I HAD A  FATHER AND SON SON I THINKWESS PRETAINS ELEVEN OR TWELVE THE FLEEING ON UNDERES BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE ANOTHER PROBLEMS DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT MUCH CAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR THE PURPOSE OF EM PP AND  FOKESET ONLY UN WHY THEY AFRAID TO GO BACK TO MEXICO OF COURSE THE GUY ND HIS SON DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT MEXICO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS AT ALL THE INTERVIEW CONTINUED SO HE HAD TRIED TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE THERE HAD TRIED TOGE A WORK PERMIT IN MEXICO AND WAS ESSENTUALLY DEMIED AND AS THEIR CANSEING HIS TALKING ABOUT YE ARE ENCOUNTERING CARTELLS AND WITNESS SAYING OTHER MY GRANCS BEING MURDERED TORTURED IN FRONT OF HS SON AND FLEEING AND BARELY GETTING AWAY YOU KNOW WHALL DAT THATS ARE BEING SHOTE THIM AND YOU KNOW TILK HIM HOUT HIS SON HAVING MIGHTYERS FOR WEEKS BECAUSE OF THIS AND THEN THEY GET STOP BY THE POLICE AND THE PLEACE TAKE ALL THEIR MONEY HERSELFANS AND BECAUSE I CAN'T GET THEM TO SAY THESE MAGIC WORDS FLAK YET THEY THREATEN ME BECAUSE I'M HUNDER BUT THAT'S ALL THEY HAD TOBUT THEY DON' KNOW THAT A TBE CAUSE I'M HUNDERIN THOSE WOULD BE THE MAGIC WORDS THAT WOULD PUT THEM IN A PROTECTED CATEGORY THEY WERE TARGATED BECAUSE OF THEIR NATIONALITY THOUGH EVEN IF THE FATHER HAD SAID BECAUSE I'M HUNDERIN THEY PROBABLY STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT BACK TO MEXICO BECAUSE ODS AR HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE PROVING THAT ANY OF THIS HAPPENED DUG HE DID WHAT THE PAUSY TOLD HIM TO DO HE SENT THEM BACK TO MEXICO THE OLD CREDIBLE FIER SCREENINGS USUALLY TOOK AN HOUR OR LESS THESE EMP P INTERVIEWS CAN LAST FOUR FIVE SIX HOURS WHEN I ASKED THESE ASYLUM OFFICERS TO DESCRIBE WHAT THESE INTERVIEWS ARE LIKE FOR THEM FOR THE MIGAINST IN FRONT OF THEM URSILIKE GAVE THE MOST FIVID PICTURE SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE VERY FIRST AND P P INTERVIEW SHE DID A FAMILY FROM ALSAVADOR TWO PARENTS IN TO KIDS SHE HAD ASCRIPT SHE HAD TO STICK TO THE FAMILY WAS EXHAUSTED AND TROMATIZED AND TOTALLY UNPREPARED YOUERE PUTT INTO A SELL YOU'RE SEPARATED FROM YOUR KIDS AND YOUR WIFE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT TO DAY YOU WERE GOING TO BE INTERVIEWED ABOUT AL SALVADOR AND YOU WERE GOING TO GET TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES COUPLE HOURS LATER THEY LEAD YOU INTO THIS REASON COLD CELL WHERE THEY CHAN YOUR HANDS TO A TABLOL IN HANDCUFFS AND SOME ONE IS SITTING ACROSS FROM YOU WHO DOESN'T SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE AND STARTS TALKING TO SOME ONE IN THE PHONE WHO STARTS TRANSLATING TO YOU THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MEXICO YOU SMELL LIKE SHIT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LIVING IN A SHELTER YOU KNOW WITHOUT ANY RUNNING WATER FOR A MONTH AND A HALF BESS YOU'VE TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY ACROSS CENTRAL AMERICA TO GET THERE AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE'S TALKING TO YOU ABOUT MEXICO THIS INTERVIEW GOES ON FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF AND THE PERSON KEEPS PAUSING IT SO THEY CAN TALK TO SOME ONE ON THE COMPUTER WHICH THEY SAY IS THERE SUPERVISER AND ANOTHER GARD LEADS YOUR WIFE IN THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN THE LAST TWELVE HOURS INTO THE INTERVIEW ROOM AND YOU CAN YOU KNOW BRUSH HER HAND AS SHE PASSES BY YOUR SO HAPPY TO SEE HER BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SEPARATED YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON SO WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN I DON'T KNOW SIR I'M SURE THEY'LL BE FINE YOUR WIFE GOES THROUGH A SIMILAR INTERVIEU ON BUT SHE KEEPS BEING CONFRONTED ABOUT THE ANSWER SHE'S GIVING BECAUSE THEI'RE DIFFERENT FROM YOURS AND THE OFFICER CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS STORY VERY SO DIFFERENTLY BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED IT HALF AN HOUR PASSES BEFORE HER CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM AND THEN THE OFFICER HAS TO TALK TO A TEN YEAR OLD BOY ABOUT WHATEVER HIS PARENTS SAID AND THEN CONFRONT THE TEN YEAR OLD BOY ON INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN HIS STORY AND HIS PARENTS STORY AND THEN THE WIFE IS LIKE WHEN AM I GOING TO SEE MY HUSBAND AGAIN THE OFFICERS LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA LET THEM KNOW IF YOU NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM URSULA MADE THE CASE OF THE FAMILY SHOULDN'T GET SENT BACK TO MEXICO AND TO HER SHOCK HER SUPERVISOR AGREED IN FACT SHE HAPPENED TO WALK OUTSIDE THE MOMENT THE FAMILY GOT RELEASED THEY'VE GOT THEIR BACK PACKS ON THEIR HOLDING HANDS SHE THOUGHT MAYBE THIS WON'T BE SO BAD BUT THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE VERY NEXT INTERVIEW A WOMAN TOLD HER OVER AND OVER SHE WAS AFRAID OF BEING RAPED AND KILLED IN MEXICO URSULA BELIEVE SHEWAS GOING BACK TO A PLACE HER THAT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BUT BECAUSE THE WOMAN COULDN'T AM A SPECIFIC PERSON WHO' TO SAULT HER URSULA HAD TO SEND HER BACK SINCE THEN IT'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN NO AFTER NO AFTER NOW ASYLUM OFFICERS TOLD ME THAT EVEN WHEN THEY FIND ONE OF THOSE UNICORN CASES THEY CHECK OFF ALL THE BOXES AND RECOMMEND NOT RETURNING TO MEXICO THEIR SUPERVISORS OVERRULE THEM ANN TOLD ME AND MI PRODUCHER NAUGHTYA RAYMON ABOUT ONE ASYLUM SEEKER'S CASE WERE THEIRE ATTACKER YEVEN SPELLED OUT THEIR MOTIVE AND IT STILL DIDN'T FLY IT WAS BASICALLY A SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS A REALLY CLEAR CONNEXTION TO THE NATIONALITY LIKE THE PERSECUTOR HEAD LIKE REALLY SAID LIKE I AM HARMING YOU BECAUSE OF THIS NATIONALITY YOU'RE NATIONALITY AND THE HARM WAS REALLY REALLY SEVERE IT WAS LYK DEFINITELY TORTURE AND H IT WAS REALLY CLEAR THAT THE POLICE LIKE WEREN'T GOINGTO DO A THING ABOUT IT DIDN'T CARE AT ALL AND THE SUPERVISER REJECTED IT WHY LIDELITAWY THEY SAID AH WE CAN'T SHOW THAT IF THIS INDIVIDUAL WENT BACK TO MEXICO THE PERSECUTOR WOULD BE ABLE TO LOCATE THEM SO THE STANDARD TO DAY'S UPSIDE DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE INTERCREDIBLE FEAR INSTEAD OF LET'S ERE ON THE SIDE OF LETTING PEOPLE IN BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO BE TORTURED OR DIE UNDER EMPY P THE STANDARD IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLY HOT SO ALMOST NOBODY GETS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELYAN SECURITHY SAYS ONLY

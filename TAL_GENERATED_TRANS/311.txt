SAULT MARICE WAS ONLY THE SECOND OR THROUGH CASE THAT HE'D WORKED ON HOW WOUCH WEIT DID YOU GIVE PEGGY'S OPINION OF MARI'E CREDIBILITY ER OR OF THE AD DID  THE TENTRAL TRUTHFULNESS OF WHAT MARISENT HAD HAPPENED I GAVE ENOUGH WAIT TO STEER THE INVESTIGATION TWER I NED A TALK TO MARI FORER WAS THERE ANYTHING THATYOU WERE USING THAT IS EVIDENT SPACED TO GET YOU TO THIS MOMENT OF LANTING TO TALK TO HER AGAIN ABOUT HER CREDIBILITY KNOW SERGEANT MASON SAYS THERE WERE A FEW OTHER ELEMENTS TO MARI STORY THAT IT CASED HIM TO QUESTION HER BUT IT WAS REALLY THE CALL FROM PEGGY THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING HE TALKS TO HIS PARTNER IN THREE DAYS AFTER THE ATTACK DETECTIVE MASOM CALLS MARIE AND THEY SAID THEY NEEDED TO SAY ME AND I JUST ALL THE SEND OUTJUST LIKEO MY IN TROUBLE I WAS MY FIRST FOR I SAID ANYTHING ELSE ONTO AM I IN TROUBLE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS SHE SAID WAS AM I IN TROUBLE AND THAT JUST WELL IN IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AM IN LONFORSEMEN AMN MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN PEOPLE TO ASK THAT OR USUALLY IN TROUBLE THEY SOMBOS ASTANGER TO COME INTO THE POLICE STATION MASON AND HIS PARTNER DETECTIVE JERRY RITGARN TOOK MARIE BACK TO A CONFERENCE ROOM TO TALT NER WAS A VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION FROM THE FIRST TIME POLICE TALK TO MARIE NOW IT WAS AN INTERROGATION SHE SAYS THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS TELL HER IT SPOKEN TO PEGGY AND THE SPOKEN TO HER EXPOY FRIEND JORDAN AND NEITHER OF THEM BELIEVED HER ABOUT BEING RAGED PEGGY WAS ONE THING BUT GEORGEAN WAS A FRIEND HE AND MARIE SPOKE ALL THE TIME HETALKED ABOUT ME BE GETTING BACK TOGETHER AND HE'D BEEN SUPPORTIVE AND SYMPATHETIC ABOUT THE RATE MARIE SUDDENLY HAD TO TRY AND FIGER OUT WHAT THESE DETECTIVES MEANT THE POLICE FOR VERY CLOSED OFF ON TELLING ME ANYTHING THAT PEGGY OR DEORDON SET THET WOULDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING THAT THEY SAID AB  S HE WANTED ME TO TELL HIM AND I COULDN'T SO A HE WAS JUST LIKE YA  IS THERE ANY REASON WHY HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE YOU AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW WE TALKED TO JEORDAN AND HE SAYS HE NEVER DOUBTED MARIE AND HE NEVER TOLD THE POLICE HE DID IN ANY CASE BOTH DETECTIVE THROUGHOUT IN THEIR REPORTS THAT MARIE SEEMED UNSURE OF HER STORY DETECTIVE RITGARNE WROUTE THAT HE FOUND MARIE TO BE MAKING QUOTE DESEPTIV STATEMENTS TO INCLUDE THAT SHE THOUGHT CERTAIN THINGS HAD HAPPENED RATHER THAN SHE WAS POSITIVE THIS HAPPENED RICGARN NOTED THAT SHE DIDN'T QUOTE TAKE A STAND AND DEMANDED THAT SHE HAD BEEN RAPED DETECTIVES MADE IT CLEAR TO MARIE THEY NEEDED TO BE CONVINCED YEARS LATER THERE WAS AN OUTSIDE REVIEW OF THE CASE BY A POLICE INVESTIGATOR E SEX CRIME SPECIALIST NAMED SERGEANT GREY GRINTA HIS REPORT SAID QUOTE THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY SERGEANT MASON AND DETECTIVE RITGARN COALD ONLY BE LABELLED AS BULLYING AND COERSIVE DETECTIVE RICGARN DECLINED TO TALK TO US SERGEANT RENT HAS REVIEW WENT ON QUOTE IF THIS HADN'T BEEN DOCUMENTED IN THEIR REPORTS I WOUL HAVEBEEN SKEPTICAL THAT THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED THE VICTIM'S CREDIBILITY QUOTE BECAME THE FOCUSS OF THE INVESTIGATION AND ALL OF THE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT POINTED TO A SERIOUS FELLONY CRIME WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED HERE'S MARIE THERE'S THE REALLY SOME GUY OUT THERE THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR IT YO JUST MAKES US UP THER JIS START ASKED ME ALL THESE QUESTIONS IN THIS GRILLING AT ME  AND I JUSTRI CRYING  I WAS CRYING AND I WAS UPSET I AN'T UNDERSTAND WAS GOING ON REALLY O I JUS AN AND STILL AN SHOCK THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME I AD WAS MAD TOO AT IT POUND MY HAND ON THE TABLE AND SUFF LIKE THAT AND THE ONLY WAY THEYUD LEAVE ME ALONE IS IS I WROTE A STATEMENT SAYING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN SO SHE DID SHE FIRST WROTE QUOTE I DREAMED SOME ONE BROKE IN AND RAPED ME THE DETECTIVES THEN INSISTED THAT SHE RERITE IT AND NOT RIGHT THAT SHE HAD DREAMED IT BUT THAT SHE HAD LIED THERRE LOTS OF REASONS A VICTIM OF SEX ABUSE MIGHT CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSE TO SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAPPENED SHAME FEAR OF RETRIBUTION BUT MARIE SAYS THAT ISN'T WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH HER SHE STARTED HAVING MOMENTS WHERE SHE ACTUALLY COULDN'T TELL IF SHE AD BEEN RATE AND LIKE I WAS TRYING TO BE REALLY HONEST A ABOUT EVERYTHING AND YOU KNOW POSSIBLY MAYBE I HAD DREAMT THAT STUFF THAT FIRST STATEMENT MAY BE THAT I HAD DREAMT IT UP AND THAT IT MAYBE DIDN'T HAPPEN AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND SO THOSE DOUBTS WERE COMING OUT WHEN I WAS TALKING TO THEM AND THEY JUSTARTED DISBELIEVING ME EVEN MORE AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN I JUS STARTED THINKING I WAS LIKE DID THIS YOU KNOW DID THIS REALLY JUST HAPPENED TO ME AN THE SOUL THING IN MY MIND I WAS SECOND GUESSING SOMEBODY COMING INTO MY HOUSE AND DOING ALL THIS T STUS YOU KNOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I JUST IMAGINE THAT IS WHY WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED TO ME I RANHOW MARIE DESCRIBES THIS NOT BEING SURE HERSELF THAT THE ASSAULT HAPPENED BY AN EXPERT ON SEX ASAULT TRAMA AND HOW IT EFFECTS THE BRAIN SHE SAID THAT THIS KIND OF COGNITIVE SEPARATION SHE CALLED IT WHILL NOT COMMENT DOES HAPPENE THAT IT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SHEER SHOCK AND ASSAULT HAS ON A PERSON LIKE FOR EXAMPLE BEING AWOKENED BY A STRANGER WITH THE KNIGHT AND AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED BEFORE LIKE MARIE IRE IT A MUCH HIGHER RISK FOR THIS HAPPENING AD FOSTER CARE TO THAT AND THE RISK IS GREATER GET THE END OF THAT DAY I WAS JUST SLIGHT TO FIND IT DID ALL DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOW I HAVE NOBODY THAT BELIEVES ME IS WANTED TO BE OVER WITH SO SO MARIE DID SOMETHING FAMILIAR TO HER SHE HAS A WAY TO DEAL WITH TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPENING TO HER THAT ARE OUT OF HER CONTROL WHICH SHE CALLS FLIPPING THE SWITCH THAT FEELING SWITCH IN SIDE JUST I TURNED IT TO NOT REALLY CARING ABOUT THE EMOTION TI WAS TURN OFF THAT SWITCH I'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH OM RIGT NOW JUS I WANT TO GET OUT HERE WHAT IS IT LOOK LIKE ONE YOU KIND OF DECIDE TO FLIT THE WITCH AND STOP CARING SO MUCH WHAT IS THAT HOW DOES YOUR DEMEANOUR CHANGE WHEN YOUR SPEAKING TO THE POLICE OFFICER WELL I'M NOT CRYING ANY MORE LOOKING AT THEM WHEN I'M TALKING TO THEM WHEN I THINK I WAS GAGGLING WHICH IST SOMETHING I DO WHEN I'M NERVOUS LIKE I JUST JUST PRETENDED LIKE THAT DIN JUST REALLY HAPPEN YE KNONE AWHEN IN BATHROM AFTER THAT AND CLANED UP AND JUST CON ACTED LIKE IT WAS FINE BOTH DETECTIVES NOTICED THE SWITCH RITGARDEN WROTE QUOTE HER VISUAL APPEARANCE AND BODY LANGUAGE BECAME REMARKABLY DIFFERENT SHE APPEARED LESS DTRESSED STOPPED CRYING AND EVEN LAUGHED A LITTLE MARIE WROTE HER FINAL STATEMENT FOR THE DETECTIVES AT THEIR INSISTENCE QUOTE I MADE UP THIS STORY SHE WROTE FO O  TOR NOT TRI RIECLS POLYON THEN WOULD NOW SAY A WOMAN WHO CLAIM SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY A

THIS GUY AND THE HORRIBLE MY WORD IS HORRIBLE THINGS THAT HE DID TO HER FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS AND IN RELATION TO OTHER VICTIMS YOU KNOW THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SAID HORRIBLE THEY WOULD HAVE BEAND I'M REVEALING THE HORRIBLE SIDE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'D DON SHE I REMEMBER WE WERE WALKING OUTSIDE FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WERE OUTSIDE AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT AN THAT HE WAS A GENTLEMAN A CALM MILD MANERD NDI JUST  REEVERGIS THINKING HOW CAN ANY ONE AFTER THIS HAPPEN CALL HIS PERSON A GENTLEMAN DETECTIVE GALBREATH AT THIS POINT HAD WORKED DOZENS OF RAPE CASES MAYBE FIFTY SHE ADMITTED SHE DIDN'T TOTALLY GET HER VICTIM BUT THAT IT DIDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF HER INVESTIGATING THE CRIME DTECTIVE GALBREATH TALKED TO HER HUSBAND ABOUT THE CASE THAT NIGHT AND HER HUSBAND A POLICE OFFICER IN ANOTHER TOWN REMEMBERED A CASE JUST LIKE IT IN HIS DEPARTMENT IN WESTMINSTER THE DETECTIVE GALBREATH CONTACTED WESTMINS REPETY THE NEXT MORNING TO LOOK AT THEIR CASE FILE DETAILS OMIST IDENTICAL THE LEAD DETECTIVE ON THAT CASE TADN A HINDER SHOT SAYS THERE WAS ONE STRIKING CONNECTION IN MY ASSAULT MYKE VICTIM WAS THE VICTIM OF A THEFT ALSO OF A PINK SONY CYBER SHOT CAMERA THAT WAS STOLEN FROM HER AND I'M STACY KNEW THAT HERD VICTIM WAS PHOLDOGRAPHT USING A PINK SONY CYBER SHOT CAMERA DETECTIVE HENDER SHOT ALSO SAID THERE WAS A THIRD RATE IN ANOTHER TOWN NEAR BY WHICH MADE THEM THINK THEIR COULD BE A SERIAL OFFENDER THE THRE DEPARTMENTS DID SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN WITH DIFFERENT POLICE DEPARTMENTS THEY STARTED MEETING WORKING TOGETHER EACH DEPARTMENT HAD COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF TRACETY ANE ASSOCIGATED WITH THEIR VICTIMS NOT THE DEFINITIVE KIND THAT CAN POSITIVELY IDEA SUSPECT BUT NOT NOTHING EITHER THE SAMPLES WERE TESTED FOR SIMILARITIES AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE CONNECTED PATERNALLY MEANING A THREE DONA SAMPLES HAD TO BE THE SAME GUY OR MEN IN THE SAME FAMILY BABOUT FIVE WEEKS AND TO DETECTIVE STACY GALLRESTS OF INVESTIGATION THERE'S A BIG MEETING FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL INVESTIGATORS ER THERE AND A FOURTH LOCAL DEPARTMENT TOO AND IN THAT MEETING SOME ONE NEW TO THE GROUP A FEMALE CRIME ANALIST STANDS UP SHE DONE A SEARCH FOR SUSPICIOUS VEHICLES IN THE VICINITY OF AN ATTEMPTED RYTE DETECTIVE HNDERSHOT SAYS AT THE VERY END OF THE MEETING SHE HAPPENS TO MENTION JUST SO THE GROUP KNOWS I CAME ACROSS THIS MOS E TRUK THAT WAS NEAR THIS CRIME SEEN JUST SO THE GROUP KNOS WHAT WHEN STACY HERE'S THAT STACY'S LIKE WAIT A SECOND WHAT DID YOU SAY I TELL HIM IS SHAID THAT'S A TRUCK ON ON OUR SURVEILLANCE FIDIO THAT WASN'T VERY RELEVANT UNTILL RIGHT NOW IT JUST ALL CAME TOGETHER ONE SECOND IT WAS JUST AT DETECTIVE STACY GALBREATH HAD ONLY SEEN THE TRUCK ON A FUZZY SURVELLANCE FIDIO BUT THIS ANALIST HAD THE MAKE MODEL AND LICEN'S PLATE THOSE REGISTERED TO A GUY NAMED MARKOLEARY DETECTIVE HENDERSHOT ALWAYS RELUCTANT TO GET TWO AHEAD OF HERSELF REMEMBERS THINKING WELL THAT'S A PRETTY BIG PIECE OF EVIDENCE POTENTIALLY BUT THEY NEEDED NOW WAS A DEONA SAMPLE FOR MARKOLEARY TO SEE IF IT TIED HIM TO THE CRIMES SO EF BUY AGENTS STAKE OUT MARK'S HOUSE THE PLAN WAS TO WAIT FR M DELEEV THEN THEY'D SPLIT UP HAVE A FEW AGENTS FOLLOW HIM WHILE OTHERS PUT UP SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE WHILE HE WAS GOM HEN MARK LEAVES HIS HOUSE AGENT'S TRAILIM WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IS THAT MARKO LEARY HAD A BROTHER WHO LIVED WITH HIM IN THE SAME HOUSE SO THE GUY THEY WERE FOLLOWING WASN'T MARK AT ALL BUT IS SLIGHTLY YOUNGER SIMILAR LOOKING BROTHER SO WHEN OTHER AGENTS GO TO THE APARTMENT AND NOCK ON THE DOOR EXPECTING IT TO BE EMPTY THER SHOCKED WHEN MARK ANSERS THE AGENTS THINK QUICKLY SAY THEIR INFORMING PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ABOUT A BURGLER EVEN HAVE A FLIER WITH A PHONY SUSPECT FOTO TO SHOWM THE CONVERSATION ENDS MARKOS INSIDE MEANWHILE MARK'S BROTHER IS EATING IN A DINER AND WHEN HE'S DONE AGENTS WUDBEN TO GET DONA OFF HIS GLASS WHICH BRINGS THEM CLOSER TO THEIR ANSWER BUT STILL NOT ALL THE WAY THERE BECAUSE WHILE DONE FROM THE BROTHER DOES LINK THE BROTHERS FAMILY LINE TO THE CRIMES DOES NOT TELL THEM WHICH BROTHER COMMITTED THEM HERE'S DETECTIVE GALBREATH SO THIS POINT WERELIKE CRAP IT COULD BE EITHER ONE REALLY WE NEED AT SEE THE LAG OF BOTH OF EM FOR A BIRTHMARK THEY NEED TO SEE THAT BIRTHMARK TWO DAYS LATER DETECTIVE GALBREATH IN OUR TEAM GO TO MARK'S HOUSE AND MARK COMES TO THE DOOR AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE WEAPONS OUT I TELL HIM YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE SEARCH WORNT FOR THE HOUSE AND I PAT HIM DOWN TO MAKE SHURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS HE'S GOT ROE BAGGY CLOTHES ON WHEN HE COMES OUT AND SO WHEN I'M

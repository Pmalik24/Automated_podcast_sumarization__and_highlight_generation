TRIN STATION WITH TRAINS THA COULD TAKE THEM WEST TO THE BORDER THEY HAD NO TICKETS IT WAS MOBED NOW AWEYHAD MONEY READY IN CASE IE NEEDED TO BRIBE SOMEBODY TO GET ON A TRAIN BUT IT WAS SUCH A MOMENT

WE WE JUST INJN HAN COFFE AND NOW I AM EIC AND O LESS RAHEGE IS HARD TO BELIEVE IT HAPPEN EVEN TOSE YOU AR SOMEBODY WHO HAD THOUGHT PRUDENT WOULD INVADE AND SHE THOUGHT THAT HE WOUL QUICKLY TRYD TO TAKE KEEVE SHE HAD ACTULLY BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING A VISA TO GET OUT BUT SHE SAID MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T BELIEVE OUT TOLD THEMSELVES IT WASN'T HAPPEN AYOU KNOW DS LAE BE TO LIE YERSO DOE HEELL SAFER I GO BACK ON THE LINE WITH RICHARD FROM THE ECONOMIZT HE'S A ACTUALLY TALKE TO LOTS OF ACRANIANS ABOUT THIS AND POINTED OUT THAT THE COUNTRY'S MEDIA AND IT'S PRESIDENT FOR WEEKS HAVE BEEN SAYING NOTHING IS GOIN O HAPPEN PRUDEN WAS HIS POSTRAING UNUNLESS YOU RAD THE FAREIGN PRESS YOU POBLY WOULDN'T BELIEVE PRUDEN WAS GOING TO INVADE OW SO HE SAYS THE FIRST THING THAT ANY EUCRANIAN WILL TELL YOU WIT TTHAT COUNTRY HAS BEENG AT WOF I YES AND SO THE IDEA THAT THIS ORL THAT RUSSIAN BATTALIAN COMING NEAR THAT BORDER SUDDENLY MEANS THAT AN INVASION IS LIKELY THEY'LL SAY THE INVASION HAPPENES TO THOUS AND FOURTEEN DO THOSN'T FOURTEEN IS WHEN THE RUSSIAN MILITARY TOOK CRIMEA FROM YOU CRANE AND PRO RUSSIAN SEPARATUS AND TWO OUCRANIAN TERRITORIES SECEEDED FROM THE COUNTRY AND THERE'VE TEENG ALL SL MATTER OF DIFFERENT FALSALANS AND SEESE FIRES COMING IN GOING THRATS IN A CRAZY RECORIC SINCE THEN AND SO SUCH A ROLLA CUST TORIDE THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW IN THAT LINES THE THE IDEA THAT AN A BUNCH OF TROOPS TUTTING OUP ON THE BORD O CHANGEEST THE GANGS FOR THEM ATS JUST THE LATEST CHEST FOR THE LATEST DRAMA AND AN LOT OF PEOPLE OF WORK OUT A GREAT RECIPES HAPPINESS WHICH IS JUST SUTTING OFF TE YOU NAR THE TIME LINE AND AND NOT READING ANY OF THIS WHAT DID YOU SEE THREE MONTHS AGO THAT CONVINCED YOU THAT THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AND YOU GOT AN APARTMEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY WELL THE THING THAT REALLY WORRIED ME WAS IT WASN'T ANY TRUT MOVEMENTS IT WAS THE NEGOTIATIONS ON DESEMBER THE SEVENTEENTS RUSSIA ON VILED TA LIST OF TE MANDS AND AH YOU READ THESE TEMANDS AND YOU TOUHT TO SAY UNMIK GOD THEY DON'T CARE BECAUSE THAT ASKING FOR THINGS THAT THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T GET AND THE ONLY KIND OF THURSTIN WHO CONDUCTS THOSE KINDS OF NEGOTIATIONS IS SOMEONE THO DOESN'T REALLY CARE WAS AN A GOOD WEATHER THE NEGOTIATIONS SUCCEED OR FAIL AND WHEN I SAW THAT THAT'S WHAT I REALIZED THAT IS GOING THROUGH THE MOSIONS SEENI THAT THAT NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THESES NEGOTIATIONS THAT THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE TROOPS ON THE MORNIN IT'S SO CRAZY THAT YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE COUNTRY WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO BASICLY JUST HAVE TO GUESS WHAT ONE MAN IS GOING TO DO HERE MAY BE MORE THAN JUST SIN INTIRE COUNTRY THAT BEAHOLWOL TO DAN'T OR PROGRAMME WE HAVE AN EPERSOID OF OUR SHORE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER BACK IN TWENTY SEVEVENTEEN ABOUT THAT MAN WADIMER PUDENT AT THE TIME IT WAS INSPIRED BY NEWS THAT HAD PEOPLE GUESSING WHAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE AND WHAT HE WAS THINKING WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER AND A'M THERE'S ONE STORY WE FOUND THE SACT ONE OF TO DAY SHOW THAT I HAVE TO ADMIT IV BEE THING ABOUT FOR WEEKS IS PRUDENT AM ASKED THETROOPS AROUND THE URCRANING BORDER IS THE STORY ABOUT WHETHER HE CAME TO POWERIN NINETEEN NINETY NINE BY KILLING A FEW HUNDRED INNOCENT RUSSIAS SO WE HAVE THAT YOU GEVEN EARD IT YOU REALLY SURED AND MORE INCLUDING WHAT RUSSIANS THINK OF HIM STAY WITH US I GONE GOING IN WITH THE BANG SO YOU HEARD THE STORY TIS SONE THING PEOPLE SPECULATED ABOUT YEARS AGO BUT NOW SEEMS MOSTLY FORGOTTEN IAV BEEN RITE WHON VLADIMER PRUDEN WAS GOMING TO POWER IS S BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE BOYSIELSON WAS PRESIDENT RUNNING RUSSIA PRUDEN WAS THE PRIME MINISTER NOT WELL KNOWN NOT WELL LIKE POLLING AT TWO PER CENT AS POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THEN BUTDNT ONLY BEEN PRIME MINISTER FOR A MONTH THERE WAS A SERIES OF BOBINGS OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN MOSCOW AND ELSEWHERE THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED PUDEN BLAMED IT ON CHECHEN REBELS INVADED CHECHNEA STARTED THE SECOND CHETCHEN WAR WHICH HE WON ITE WAS POPULAR WAR CATAPULTED HIM INTO THE PRESIDENCY WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE HE HAD FIFTY THREE PER CENT OF THE BOAT AND EVEN BACK THEN WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE IN TWO THOUSAND THERE WAS A QUESTION DID HE BOMB THOSE BUILDINGS HIMSELF TO CREATE THE PRETECTS FOR THE WAR AND HIS OWN RISE TO POWER IF HE DID OF COURSE A CAUSED THE LEGITIMACY OF HIS PRESIDENCY ANTO QUESTION IN A BIG WAY MURDERING HIS OWN CONSITUENTS EXACTLY THE KINDS OF RUSSIANS THAT ECLAIMS TO BE SURVEYING AND PROTECTING AS PRESIDEN WHENEVER PRODUCIERS ROBIN SEMIAN TALK TO REPORTERS WHO COVERED THIS AND REVIEWED THE EVIDENCE WITH THEM THEFORE WE GET TO THE MORE MYSTERIOUS ASPECTS OF THE BOMMINGS A QUICK SUMMERY OF WHAT HAPPENED THE BOMBINGS CAME IN FAST SUCCESSION FOUR BOMBS IN TWO WEEKS IN RANDOM LOCATIONS AND MOSCOW AND TWO OTHER CITIES EARLY SEPTEMBER WAS THE FIRST ONE A BOBIN A TRUCK WENT OFF RIGHT OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT BUILDING COLLAPSING IT OVWERE SIXTY PEOPLE DIED DAYS LATER THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY ANOTHER BOMB GOES OFF ON THE GROUND FLOOR OF A NINE STORY APARTMENT BUILDING NINE STORIES FLATTENED KILLING OVER NINETY PEOPLE WITHIN DAYS THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE AND THAT A FOURTH THEILDINGS DESTROYED IN THE NIGHT WHILE PEOPLE WERE INSIDE SLEEPING DAVID SATTER WAS IN AND OUT OF THE COUNTRY OF THE TIME HE'S BEEN REPORTING ON RUSSIA SINCE THE SEVENTIES THE WAS IN THATMOSFERE OF PAMIC THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS CERIFIED PEOPLE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT ANY APARTMENT OCOULD BE BLOWN UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND ANY FAMILY COULD BE BURIED UNTO THE REB THERE WERE THIRTY THOUSAND APARTMENT BELOCKS IN MOSCOW AND PATROLS NIGHT PATROLS WOR ANISET IN ALL OF THEM TO PREVENT TERROS FROM U IN BOMBS IN THE BASEMENS THE GOVERNMEN IMMEDIATELY BLAMED THE BOMMINGS ON CHECHN GARILLAS SCOTT ANDERSON AS ANOTHER REPORTER WHO IS WRITTEN ABOUT THE ATTACKS CHECHENS TEND TO BE MORE DARKLY COMPLECTED THAN OU TOPOLESNIC RUSSIANS SO ANYONE WHO WAS DARKLY COMPLECTED ON THE STREETS OF MOSCOW WAS SUBJECT TO A REST ER BEING BEATEN UP AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM THE CAUCASIS DID THEY THINK THEY WOULD TO STAY INSIDE THEY WERE THEY WERE FRAED TO GO OUT IN THE STREETS BUT THIS STORY THAT CHETCHAND WERE BEHIND THE BOMINGS SKIND OF FISHY FOR STARTERS IT WAS THREE YEARS AFTER CHECHNEY AN RUSSIA HAD FINISHED A WAR THE FIRST CHETCHEN WAR CHETCHNEY AND BASICALY ONE THEY SIGNED TO PIECE TREATY AGAIN SCOTT WHAT MOTIVE DID THE CHECHANS HAVE TO START THIS BOMBING CAMPAIGN AGAINST RUSSIA WIND THEY PRETY MUCH HAD EVERYTHING THEY WANTED THERE WAS NO REASON TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS AT THIS POINT RIGHT THEY'D WON THE WAR TAT THAT'S RIGHT THEY HAD WON THE WAR SO WHY COMMAND ACTS OF TERROR THAT WERE BIG ENOUGH TO START ANOTHER WAR AND JUST LEGISTICALLY IT WOULD HAV BEEN HARD TO PULL OFF EVEN IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE RUSSIA WIT IT WAS A VERY HEAVILY POLICE STATE AND SO SERLY BY AFTER LIKE THI SECOND OR THIRD BOBING THERE WERE POLICE CHECK POINTS ALL OVER SURLY ALL OVER MOSCOW ALL OVER MAJOR RUSSIAN CITIES SO THE IDEA OF THESE BOBERS MOVING ROUND IND THESE WERE CONCRUDE EXPLOSIVES EVERY HEAVY FIFTY A KEELO SACKS OF OF EXPLOSIVES HEU NEED HALL AROUND  YOU NEEDED CAR SEURE GOING THROUGH CHECK POINTS AND WITH THE WHOLE HISTERY AGAINST AGAINST CHETCHANS CERTAINLY ANYBODY WHO WAS ACAN DARKLY COMPLECTED GOING THROUGH IT A CHECK POINT WAS GOING TO BE THOROUGHLY SEARCH EVEN SOME PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT QUESTION THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT DAVID SATER WAS IN MOSCOW RIGHT AFTER THE BOMMINGS AND A FRIEND WHO HAD GOOD CONNECTIONS TOLD DAVID THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THE SECURITY SERVICES WHO SUSPECTED H AT BESS B THAT'S THE MODERN VERSION OF THE CG B BASICALLY MIGHT BE BEHIND THE BOMINGS SO DAVID ASKED TO MEET SOME OF THOSE GUYES ON PERSON AND THEY AGREED BUT THIS WAS SUCH A DANGEROUS IDEA THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T CAUGT SO THEY HAD THIS VERY PRIVATE CONVERSATION IN A VERY PUBLIC PLACE IN THE CENTERE MOSCOW Y DON'T WONE TO GIVE AWAY TOO MANY DETNOS BYTHER WAS IN IN  IN A STORE OF SOME SORT IN THE BUILDING NOT FAR FROM THE BOLSHOY THEATR AND TO OFF PEOPLE COMING AND GOING BUT WE DIDN'T GIVE ANY INDICATION WERWERE TALKING MUCHESS COUPLE MEN STANDING THERE TALKING BOUT SOMMEN THAGENT DID NOT PROOVE BUT SOME THINGS JUSTED NOT UP FOR EXAMPL OF THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE BLOWN UP WITHEXIGON WHICHES A VERY VERY POWER FROM EXPLOSE OF THE CHUSE TO TALK OFF ARTILLERY SHOS AND IS DISAVAILABLE ONLY IN ONE FACTORY IN RUSSIA WHICH IS TIGHTLY GUARDED BY THE AFFESS B IT'S ALSO IT MILITARY BASAS HOW WOULD TERRAS GET HEXIGEN AT ALL AGENT SAID LET ALON DRIVE BIG QUANTITIES OF IT AROUND RUSSIA UNCHECKED WHEN YOU HEARD THI STUFF WERE YE THINKING THESE ARGUMENTS WERE CONVINCING OR WERE YOU ALSO THINKING WELL I WASTEN TA COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS TA GOVERNMENT PROVOCATION BUT WHAT CONVINCED ME WAS  THE BONB THAT DID NOT GO OFF THE FIFTH BOM THE FIFTH BON AND YET ANOTHER CITY REAZON AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY ABOUT THE CHECHENS SEEMS TO REALLY FALL APART AND WHERE THE STORY GETS TRULY STRANGE SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN NINETY NINE TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AFTER THE FIRST DEPARTMENT BOM A COUPLE OF RESIDENTE AND A BUILDING AN RIAZAN NOTICE SOMETHING WEIRD ONE GUY A BUST DRIVER WHO LIVED IN THE BUILDING SAW A CAR A WHITE CITI ON PARKED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING MORA

LICENSE PLATE LIKE WITH A SHARPY OR SOMETHING YET LIKE A MAGIC MARKER ON A PIECE OF PAPER TAPED OVER THE LICENSE PLATE OH AND THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY LIKE SOMETHING THAT KIND OF HE THOUGHT HUH SO CALLS

TRIED TO KILL THEM THOUGH OF COURSE SINCE THIS WAS RUSSIA THEY WOULDN'T SAY IT QUITE THAT WAY WHAT THEY WOULD SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION WHOSE INTERESTS WERE SERVED BY THIS WHO HAD SOMETHING TO GAIN IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT WHO HAD SOMETHING TO GAIN WOULD YOU ASK THEM WHO DO YOU THINK YO AND WHAT WULD PEOPLE SAY WHO ELSE THE GOVERNMENT BUT LET ME SAY THAT SOME DIDN'T WERE WILLING TO GO TO SAY THAT OT LOUD YOU KNOW THEY WOULD SAY WHO HAD SOMETHING TO GAIN AND AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A PAUSE AN YOU KNOW THEY WOULD RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS AND I WOULD SAY WHO DO YOU

OF EVIDENCE THAT STARTED TO SEIM IMPORTANT I TELLYOU ONMAR RIGHT AFTER ONE OF THE BOMBS WENT OFF IN MOSCOW THIS WAS THE THIRD BOM THE SPEAKER OF THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT A GUY NAMED SLESNYAFF MENTIONE TO THE BOM BUT GOT THE CITY RAM MIND YOU HE WAS IN MOSCOW AND THE BOM WAS IN MOSCOW THE HE SAID THE BOM WENT OFF IN VULGANDOTS HERE' SCOTT ANDERSON SO YOU COALD MAKE IT SAY I WELL HE SOMEHOW HE SAID VOLGODONSKINSTEAD OF MOSCOW EXCEPT THAT THREE DAYS LATER AN A PARTMENT BUILDING IN IN VOLGADONSK WAS BLOWN UP WELL RAISING IT THE QUESSION OF HOW A IT'S LESS ENOUGHROM YOU HO BOUT THE BOMBING THREE DYS AHEAD OFTIME THE NEXT THING THE HAPPENS IS AFTER THE BOM FINALLY DID GO OFF IN VULGAN DONTS ANOTHER MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT A GY NAMED ZERENOVSKY CONFRONTS THE SPEAKER ABOUT HOUSE SUSPICIOUS THIS LOKS HE SAYS YOU TOLD US ON MONDAY THAT A BUILDING IN VULGAN DONPS WAS BLOWN OUT THREE DAYS BEFORE THE EXPLOSION DEARNOVSKY CALLS THE ACT MONSTROUS AND SAYS HIE'LL TRIED TO KEEP THE SPEAKER FROM BEING

AND GETS HIT IN THE BACK WITH A FOLDER EWTHERE WAS AND OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE APARTMENT BOMANS TRIALS CONVICTIONS ALL HELD IN PRIVATE NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AR RESS PEOPLE WERE CONVICTED THEY WERE NOT ANVESTIAGENTS THEY WERE NOT CHATCHENS EITHER THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT WHO TRIED TO LOOK DEEPER INTO THE BOMANS BUT OVER AL THAT ASN'T GONWAL MOST NOTABLY AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVEAS POLITICIANS AND INVESTIGATORS AGAIN SCOTT AHEAD OF THAT COMMISSION I WAS KILLED WAS MURDERED SHOCTO DETH IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE ANOTHER MEMBER THE COMMITTEE DIED UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND A POLETKOVSCOTA INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS ONE OF RUSSIAS LEADING INVESTCATE JOURNALIST WAS MURDERED IN HER APARTMENT BUILDING SHE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT THE ACASTING DOUBTS ON THE APARTMENT BULDING BOMINGS A AND OF COURSE IEXANDER LIT FON YANKOW CAME PUBLICLY ACCUSING THE PUTEN RCIME OF OF DUING E PONPINBONES HES POISINPOLONIAN IN LONDONN TWO THOUSAND SIX EN DOGS RADIO ACTIVE POISON POLONIUM TWO TEN SLIPPED INTO HIS TEE A BRITISH INVESTIGATION DETERMINED TWO EFFESPIAGENTS HAD KILLED LE FINIANKO AND THAT PUTENT HAD LIKELY SIGND OBONEN IT IS OT A BIOGRAPHY WHICH CAME OUT IN TWO THOUSAN PUTEN ROUNDLY DENIED ANY EFESPI INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOBINGS WRITING UTE WHAT BLOWING UP OUR OWN APARTMENT BUILDINGS YOU KNOW THAT IS REALLY UTTER NONSENSE IT'S TOTALLY INSANE NO ONE IN THE RUSSIAN SPECIAL SERVICES WOULD BE CAPABLE OF SUCH A CRIME AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE UNDAVID SATAR HAS BEEN RESEARCHING THE SINCE IT HAPPENED AND HAS WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ABOUT IT HE'S CONVINCED THE STORY WENT LIKE THIS BEFORE THE BOBINGS EVEN BEFORE PUTEN CAME TO POWER BOR AS ALTON AND HIS ADMINISTRATION WERE PLAGUED WITH CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS HE WORRIED THEY COULD EVENTUALLY POINT TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY ESPECIALLY IF SOME OTHER PARTY OR SOME ONE UN SYMPATHETIC TO HIM BECAME PRESIDENT SO HE LOOKED TO A POINTED PRIME MINISTER WHO HE COULD TRUST HE FIRED TWO OTHER GUIES AND JUST THREE MONTHS BEFORE LANDING ON PUTEN THEN HE AND PUTEN TOGETHER HAD THE APARTMENTS BLOWN UP AS THE PRETEXT TO GO TO WAR AND IN THE PATRIOTIC GLOW TWO IN STALL PUTEN AND QUASHED THE CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS SCOTTON MORE AREN'T SO SURE FOR MORA WHEN IT COMES TO THE BOMBINGS SHE GETS THAT SOMETHING WAS DONE BY DESIGN AND THAT IT APPEARS TO BE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES BUT AS FOR WHO WAS BEHIND THE BOMBINGS EXACTLY SHE CAN'T TELL MEAN IF YOU ASK ME WHAT I THINK I HAVE TO SAY TO THE DAY I DO NOT KNOW BUT THIS IS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DO YOU MEAN BECAS WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OR PEOPLE AROUND PUTEN PLETEROL OR WHETHER THEY DIDN'T THE EFFECT IS THE SAME EITHER YOU BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THE BALMINGS THAT THEYE WERE TERRORUS OUT TO KILL ORDINARY RUSSIANS IN WHICH CASE YOU ARE FRIGHTENED AND THE WORLD IS A VERY SCURY PLACE OR YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT OR SOMUCH CONNECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE BLOODY MINDED ENOUGH TO KILL THREE HUNDRED INNOCENT CEVILIANS IN THEIR BEDS IN WHICH CASE THE WORLD IS A VERY SCARY PLACE AND YOU SHOULD BE FRIGHTS THIS IS HOW IT WORKS IN THE POLICE STATE YOU SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED AND THAT HOW THE GOVERNMENT EXERCISES CONTROL  BEEN NEARLY TWO NECKATE SINCE THE BOMBINGS AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT A PEOPLE IN RUSSIA THINK ABOUT THE PUTENE STELL THEIR PRESIDENT HAVE A GA DEAL ARE THEY OUR PEOPLE WALKING AROUND WONDERING IF THEIR PRESIDENT CAME TO POWER BY KILLING HUNDREDS OF RUSSION CITIZENS SO I INTERVIEWED FOUR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN MOSCOW NONE OF THEM SAID THEY WERE BIGE SEP PORTERS OF PUTEN THREE OF THE FOUR HAD HEARD THE RUMOR THAT HE WAS BEHIND THE BOMBINGS NONE OF THEM BELIEVED IT OR WANTED TO BELIEVE IT I CAN'T KNOW THE TRUTH SO I CAN'T SAY A FORTY TWO YEAR OLD SCREEN WRITER TOLD ME A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD STUNITOCTI SAID SHE DIDN'T WANTO KNOW IF IT WAS TRUE AS FOR RHEAZAN ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR A TELL COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST HAD HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT REAZAN THE SACTS OF SUGAR ANY OF THAT OU KYOU ALL THE DETAILS THOU RIDE A BOOK ABOUT IT AND HE BELIEVES REASON WAS AND AT THAT SPEDRO THE ONE PERSON WHO NEVER HEARD THE STORY THAT PUDEN MIGHT BE BEHIND THE BOMANGS WITH JULIA A FORTY YEAR OLD LAWYER I THIN Y OSOLA  YE SEIT'S TEMOSELIN HAMATI ITS IS JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DISCUSS THE MEDIA DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE FAMILIES DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THIS AND FRANDS DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS EACH OTHER DOES IT JUST SEEM LIKE OLD NEWS UPSID YOU  YES ABSOLUTELY SO I RAN THROUGH ALL THE FACTS WITH HER ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT PRUDENT MIGHT BE BEHIND THE BOMINGS SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T CARE DOES TIT SOUND LIKE OUR RIDI CULOUS THEORY I ASKED YES SHE SAID MOST LIKELY SOME RIDICULOUS THEORY POBIN SEMI H TO MISTER POPULAR SO ONE OF THE NOTABLE THINGS ABOUT BAT HIM OF PUDEN IS TIT FOR YEARS IS THAT STUNNINGLY HIGH APPROVAL WRATINGS AMONG RUSSIANS IN JANUARY NOY FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR AS TENTIONS ROSE WITH YOU CRANE IS A PROVE A NUMBERS ROSE WITH THEM TO SEVENTY ONE PER CENT FROM THE SIXTIES BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN WE FIRST BROADCASTODAYS PROGRAM THE PRESSERAS RE PORTING THA IT HIS APPROV AL RATINGS WERE SOMETING LIKE EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT WHICH FOR YOU EST PRESIDENT THAT WOULD BE JUST LIKE UNTHINKABLE AND WE WONDERED IS THAT REAL AT ALL THAT EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT WER IS TAT FROM SOME YOU KNOW INSTITUTION CONTROLLED BY PRUDENT SO BACK  THEN WE ASKE CHARLES MAINS TO LOOK INTO THIS FOREST HE IS NOW IMPIARS MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT WELL IT IS REAL I MEAN THESE ARE REAL POLES WHERE LARGE NUMBERS OF REAL PEOPLE REALLY DO ANSWER QUESTIONS RUSSIA HAS TWO BIG PULLING FIRM THAT OR SENTIALLY STATESPONSERD A AND ONE THAT'S INDEPENDENT AND ALL THREE OF THESE GET BASELY THE SAME NUMBERS ATHIS MONTH PUDEN DROPE BY TWO PER CENT TO EIGHTY TWO PER CENT AND AMERICAN PULSTERS LIKE GALLOP IN PEU YOUKNOW THEY ALSO GET THE SAME RESULTS IN THE EITIES YO EDIES FUT A PEOPLE TO SAYING THAT THEY LIKE PRUDENT BECAUSE THEY ARE SCARED TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE WELL IT'S PART OF IT I MEAN ESPECIALY WITH OLDER PEOPLE ATHERE WAS A PULL DONE BY THIS LAVADA SENTER THIS IS THE INDEPENDENT POLSTER IN RUSSIOW SAYING THAT TWENTY SIX PER CENT OF ALL RESPONDENTS SAID THEIR AFRAID TO SHARE THEIR VIEWS OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH POLSTERS SO THAT PROBABLY IN FLAHTES THE NUMBER BUT JUST HOW MUCH IS ARETLY CLEAR SO C IF EIGHT TO PER CENT IS IN THE RIGT NUMBER LIKE DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT A MORE ACCURATE MEASURE OF HIS POPULARITY MIGHT BE WE WILL SOME POLSTER SAY IT'S THE SO CALLED ELECTORAL RATING THIS IS WHEN YOU ASK RUSSIANS TWO THEY ACTUALLY VOTE FOR LIKE THE LAVADA SENTER HAS THIS A POLL THEY DO WHERE THEY SAY IF THE PRESIDENTIAL LECTIONS WERE HELD NEXT SUNDAY WHO WOULD YOU VOTE FOR AND THEN ONLY FIFTY FIVE PER CENTS SAY THEY VOTE FOR PRUDENT AND THAT'S THE GANTHE AN INDEPENDENT POLSTERS THE STATE ONE HAS A FIGURE THAT'S A LITTLE HIGHER SIXTY FOUR PER CENT BUT YOU NOW THAT'S HARDLY THE EIGHTY TWO EIHTY FOUR THAT WE SEEN SO WHAT A GET FROM THIS IS TAKE THE EIHTY TWO EGHTY FOUR PERCENT A PRIVARATING WITH GRAND ASOLT BUT IT IS TRUE THAT MOST PEOPLE APPROVE OF HIM YE HE STILL REALLY POPULAR A CASE O TO HEAR OF WHAT THAT PROVAL AS ALL ABOUT AND WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF HIM WE ASKE YOU TO TALK TO SOME PEOPLE WHO LIKE HIM WHICH YOU DID PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THEN YOU PUT TOGETHER THIS STORY ABOUT ONE OF THEM THIS IS SOMEONE I KNEW WOULDN'T EXAGGERATE THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY WERE TALKING TO A FOREIGN REPORTER SOME ONE I'VE KNOWN FOR DECADES YE OYE AND E L MTHAT'S HER TALKING HERE OGUSTOR GAVE N TH DEMETRI COMPNIS I LIVE WITH OLD E SER GAM AND OR TWO CHILDREN BACK IN THE MIDNINETIES WHEN I WAS AN EXCHANGED STUDENT IN MOSCOW SO GOOD FIVE YEARS BEFORE PUDEN ARRIVED ON THE SCENE VOR THE YEAR SHE TOOK IN SEVERAL AMERICAN EXCHANGE STUDENTS SIMILRLYLILY EN WE LET'S HER TELLING ME I WAS HER FAVORITE AND I TELL HER ALWAYS SAY I OF RUSSIAN MA'M Y YELETERS TOMIA THAT THAT METI T SHE SAYS I ALWAYS

BIDIN THE DOP PUTEN STILL THE SMARTUS TO THE PACK COMING OUT ANOTHER EASIN RUSSIAN SEE PUTEN THE WAY THEY DO WE GET TO KNOW THE DISINFORMATION MASTER MIND WHO RESHAPED THE WORLD OF RUSSIAN POLITICS INTO WHAT IT IS NOW THAT IS IN A MINUTE CHICAGO BUP A GRADIO WHEN OUR PROGRAMM CONTINUES TO SMARICAN LIFE MYER GLASS TODAY'S PROGRAMM THE OTHER MISTER PRESIDENT STORIES OF LADIMER PRUDEN AND THIS AROUND HIM WE ARRIVED TO DACT THREE OF OUR PROGRAMM AC THREE MAY BE PAIYD A LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN IS S QUIT THAT WE HEARD WHILE WE WERE WORKING ON TODAY'S PROGRAMM BACKIN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FROM WRITER NAMED PETER PRAMARANZIV HE SAID THAT IF THE OLD SOVIET UNION WAS SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT VIOLENCE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT PROPAGANDA NTO DAY'S RUSSIA THIS NEMBERS ARE REVERSED IT'S TWENTY FIVE PER CENT VIOLENCE AND SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT PROPAGANDA IN PROPAGANDA WAS RADICALLY REINVENTED ONDIVADAMA PUTEN IT'S TACTICS AND ITS METHODS BUT THIS ONE POLITICAL OPERATIVE JOHNKOLL EXPLAINS THE OPERATIVE'S NAME IS LADISLOV SIR KOUG HE WAS PUTENT'S DEPUTY OF CHIEF FOR MORE THAN A DECADE STARTING IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE IN RUSSIA HE'S WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS A POLITICAL TECHNOLOGIST BUT THOSE ARE A DIAMOND DOZEN AT THE TOP OF HIS POWERS SERKO HAD A MUCH MORE OMINOUS IF AN OFFICIAL TITLE HE WAS KNOWN AS A GRAY CARDINAL HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SHADOWY MASTER MINE HE SORT OF RESEMBLES ROAN ATKINSON THE ACTOV PLAYED MISTER BEAN EXCEPT HANDSOMER AND HE ACTUALLY DOESN'T MANAGE PROPAGANDA AT THE PREMLAN ANY MORE BUT THE METHODS HE INVENTED TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE IN INFORMATION I'VE EVEN HEARD THEM CALLED PARTISTIC SEE IN THE SOVIET ERA THE COUNTRY WAS RUN BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE PROPAGANDISTS PUMPED OUT LITERALLY THE PARTY MINE AND TRIED TO SUPPRESS ALL OTHER OPPOSING MESSAGES AND THEN THE IRON CURTAIN FELL A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW POLITICAL PARTIES WERE CREATED AND IT WAS THE MESSY EARLY STAGES OF A REAL DEMOCRACY WITH PARTIES BICKERING IN VYING FOR POWER AND THEN WHEN PUDEN BECAME PRESIDENT AND OBVIOUSLY SKIPPING OVER A LOT HERE HIS RIGHT HAND MAN SERKOV HELPED SOLIDIFY THE KREMLIN'S POWER BY PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PARTY CALLED UNITED RUSSIA WHICH GAINED MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT AND BACKED PUTEN AND THEN INSTEAD OF TAMPING DOWN THE OPPOSITION LIKE THE OLD DAYS SERKOV BUILT A NEW SYSTEM WERE THERE WAS OPOSITION BUT HE DICTATED WHAT THE OPPOSITION STOOD FOR YOU DO NOT ALAW POLITICAL PARTIES TO CRATE THEIR ON AGANDUS YOU JUST RITE THIS GENDIS FOR THEM THIS IS VESILLY GATOV HE'S BEEN A VERY HIGH LEVEL PLAYER IN RUSSIAN MEDIA FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS THESE SDASIES A VISITING FELLOW AT THE ANINBURG CENTER ON COMMUNICATION LEADERSHIP AND POLICY WELL WE DECIDE BONOFOUR PARTIES IS LEFT PARTY WITH SOM SORT OF COMUNISM ANDOTHER PARTIES YOU WERE A SOCIALIS AND THE THIRD PARTIES SIR DEEP CONSERVATV KAND OFFI YOUV EVEN JALICALS AND THE FOURTH PARTY WOULD BE AS AR OF LEBERAL RADICALS AND THA THAT'S WHATS SOKOL ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTED AND HE CREATED WHOLE NEW POLITICAL PARTIES AND WROTE THER AGENDAS FOR EXAMPLE A HE CREATED A PARTY COLTS PRUTUDLYWHERE I SEE JUST RUSSIA JUST RUSSIA AYE THAT WAS A IT WAS A POLITICAL KADAVER ARE YOU SAYING IAVER LIKE A CORPSE KADAVER LIKE A KADAVER A MELALIKE FRANKENSTAN FRANKENSTIN GATA CREATED FROM SOME SORT OF PIECES OF SOCIALISTS ALABOR ACTIVISTS MORE PROGAFROMAN TIPE E FLABOR UNIONS HE ALSO DECIDED THAT HE CANNOT ALLOW EIGHTY DRATRUTEC TIIT IS WHICH WOULD NOT BE THAT TA BY KRAMLIN SO HE DECIDED THAT YOU WILL CREATE ALSO YUSE MOVEMENTS AND RITAGANDE FOR THEM AND HE ALSO TRI TO DO THE SAME THINK WER ANGIOS LIKE POLITICAL ANGIOS OR THOSE THAT CONTROL E ACTIANS  CONSPARENCS Y OR EXPOSED DROPTION SE WRITING IT GAN DE FOR EVERY EVERY ONE OF THEM IN THE KREMLIN IT'S LIKE DIRECTING A MOVY IN A WAY ABSOLUTELY I WOULD EVEN PROVIDE YOU WITH A VERY FINNY HYPOTISIS IN TWO THOUSAND ON I THINK RASSIA HAS BEING INVADED BY REALITY SHOWS NER THINKS LIKE SURVIVER BEBRATHER AND HE WAS AMAZED HOW SCRIPTINK CAN IMPROVE EVEN THOSE LIKELY SPENTANEOS INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE AND I KNOW THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD FRIEND WITH ALL THE PRODUCERS OF THIS ER REALITY SHOAV ACTUALLY AND ACTUALLY I THINK HO WAS ONCE EVEN PRESENT AT THE FILMING OF THE RUSSIAN VERSIONAL SURVIVOR NO WAY AND HE IS LIKE IF THEY CAN DO THAT ON T V SORT OF FAK REALITY AND T V MAY BE WE CAN FAK REALITY IN REALITY IN THE WAY YBY TWO DOESEN THREE SO ABOUT FOUR YEARS INTO SERKOV'S TENUREAS GREAT KARDINAL THET SILLY SAYS SERKOV HAD BUILT UP A WHOLE CODREY OF DEPUTIES THAT WOULD CARRY OUT HIS AGENDA WITH THESE DIFFERENT PARTIES AND OTHER GROUPS I ASKED VICILY FOR AN EXAMPLE OF HOW ALL THIS WORK AND HE TOLD ME WHAT EVERYBODY TOLD ME WHEN I ASKED FOR SPECIFICS HE SAID IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS IN THE ROOM WITH HIM I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID TO WHOM NOR WHEN HE DID TELL ME ABOUT THIS ONE CASE THAT HE HEARD ABOUT FROM SOMEONE WHO WORKED WITH SERKOV IN TWO THOUSAND FOR VLADIMER PUTEN DECIDED THAT GOVERNORS SHOULDN'T BE ELECTED ANY MORE THEY SHOULD BE APPOINTED BY HIM T'S LONG STORY BUT AT FIRST EVERY OTHER POLITICAL PARTY BESIDES PUTENS WAS AGAINST THE IDEA GENUINELY AGAINST IT BUT THEN SERKOV MANIPULATED THEM OVER TO HIS SIDE IT HELP THAT HE CONTROL THEIR FUNDING IN THE NUMBER OF SEATS THEY GOT IN THE DUMA AND THEN THE PARTIES WENT THROUGH THIS WHOLE DRAWN OUT PUBLIC DRAMA WHICH HAD ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF DEMOCRACY THE BILL SUBMITTED THEIR ARGUMENTS FOR IN AGAINST IT PROTEST SURROUND THE COUNTRY PEOPLE ANNOUNCED THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR MINDS R SEVERAL VOTES AND FINALLY AFTER THREE MONTHS IT PASSES ALL OF THIS VASTILY SAYS WAS SCRIPTED BY SERKOV'S PEOPLE THE NAME YOU HERE FOR ALL THESE TECHNIQUES IS MANAGED  DEMOCRACY SERKOV USES THE PHRASE SOVEREIGN DEMOCRACY I SUGGESTED TO ONE PERSON I TALK TO THAT MANAGED DEMOCRACY  SOUNDS LIKE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS HE SAID EXACTLY IT JUST MEANS THERE'S NO DEMOCRACY   ANY ONE OVERSTATE SERKOV'S TOWER NOR HIS MALEVOLENCE APPARENTLY HE WAS MUCH MORE CARROT THAN STICK IN HIS APPROACH EXPLAINING WHY NO YOU REALLY WANT TO ALINE YOURSELF WITH THE KREMLIN HERE IS WHAT'S TO BE GAINED AND HE DIDN' TRY TO DO THIS WITH EVERYBODY HE MAINTAINED UNDER THIS MANAGE OR SOVEREIGN DEMOCRACY A CERTAIN LEVEL OF DESSENT ITSOME ACTUAL OPPOSITION ACTUAL OPPOSITION BOTH IN SOCIETY AND PRESS AND EVEN ENJOYED THIS DESSENT BECAUS IT WAS DEVELOPING NATURE LEADERS LIKE NEVOLNY THAT'S ELECINE OF ALNY HE MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM HE IS A HIGH PROFILE ACTOVEST HE S CONSIDERED TO BE THE ONLY REAL OPPONENT TO PUTEN EXCEPT HE CAN'T RUN AGAINST PUTEN BECAUSE PUTENTS PEOPLE HAD HIM ARRESTED AND YOU CAN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND RUSSIA IF YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD TO BE ONES TEVILY EMERGED WITHIN THIS SANTBOKES OF FR ALOIT FREEDOM THAT SERKOV CREATED AND AND IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR HIM BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF MAKING HES KAMEFLASH OF FATOCRACY MUCH THAT A LOKI THE MORE YOU HERE ABOUT SERKOV THE MAN THE MORE IT MAKES YOU UNDERSTAND HOW HIS WHOLE TRUMENSHO THEATRICAL DIRECTING OF SOCIETY DEVELOPED HE HAS ALL OF THESE OPPOSING FACTIONS INSIDE OF HIM TOO ALL WORKING IN AN UNLIKELY BUT PERFECT CONCERT TOGETHER BACK IN THE EARLY NINETIS HE WAS A PARGY DESIGNING ADS FOR THE RICHEST OLGARK IN RUSSIA AND THAT POINT SERKOV SAID HE WANTED TO BE LIKE QUOT THE HERO AND PRETTY WOMAN THAT THE RICHARD VEER CHARACTER BUT HE'S ALSO A HUGE FAN AF THE ANTI BUROCRACY GAY BUT IS TO BEAT POET ALLAN GINSBURG THIS IS SERKOV RECITING GINSBURG'S PAM SUNFLOWER SUITRA FROM MEMORY AND YOU THERE STANDIN BEFOR ME IN THIS SONSET AND ALL THE OGLOMY IN YOUR FORM AT NOTIC BEAUTY OFFISIN FLOWN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL THAT SERKOV STUDIED THEATRE BUT HE GOT KICKED OUT OF THE MOSCOW IN SITUDE OF CULLTURE AFTERE A FISTFIGHT REPORTEDLY IAS WRITTEN LYRICS FOR A RUSSIAN MAN CALLED AGATHA KRISTY AND SO YOU MARRY PR AND ARE IN PERFORMANCE PLASIS TIME AT RUSSHA'S MAIN STATE TVINAT WORK CHANNEL WINE MANAGE DEMOCRACY WAS JUST THE NATURAL CULMINATION A HE WAS KIND OF ENTERTAINING HIMSELF AGAIN VASILY GATOV  WAS REALLY FUNNY FOR HIM TO TO MAKE THIS THINKS HAPPEN TO WA CHI CERTAIN RESOUTS AND AND THERE SOT OF CREATIVE BUILD ING ALL FREOLITY A AGAIN AS I SAID IT'S IT'S A VERY MUCH BIG BROTHER TYPE OF SCRIPTING HE MEANS THE REALITY SHOPIC BROTHER IMIN YOU YOU NEED TO CREATEA CONFLICT AND THIS CONFLICT WILL CREATE THE CONFLICT AND THAN AN THAN WE CUS ARULAGOWD AND PEOPLE WILL FOUT AND THAT WOULD BE FOUND BESIDES WHICH HE COULD TOTALLY GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE NOT ONLY WAS HE GOOD AT IT BUT IN SERKOV'S TIME IS GREAT CARDINAL NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE WERE PAYING ATTENTION AT THIS MOMENT APEOPLE WERE ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTED IN POLITDICS BECAUS RUSSIA HAD AND MAYSO EKONOMY GROV OF ABOUT MIN PROSATE HERE AN THE RUBLE WAS SIR KIND OF TAKING SANG FIR A CREDIT WAS EXTEMELY CHEP THE COUNTRY WAS BOOMING I  EASY TO BIALD ATOKRASY WHEN KANTINS MEN  GERS NOBODY CARES ABOUT POLITICS I AND I THINK ZERKOV WASN'T DURING THIS MOMEN BECAUSE HE WAS AND NOT ONLY KIND OF FAR SHADO KARDENO BAT HEJECTURY WAS OPENLY KARDENAING THE VISIDATION THAT IS AFTER A CERTAIN POINT HE WOULDN'T TAKE VERY MANY PAINS TO HIDE WHAT HE WAS DOING WHICH I CAN IMAGINE THE FEELING HERE HE IS CARRYING OFF ALL THESE FEATS OF MANIPULATION IN SECRET HOU THINK HE'D WON A LITTLE CREDIT ON THIS POINT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN SERKOV SEEMED TO BE SHOWING HIS CARDS A LITTLE BIT DELIBERATELY IT'S A STORY THAT PETER POMARANSEV LIKES TO TELL HE'S THE JOURNALIST THAT I WEREQUOTED EARLIER PETER USED TO WORK IN REALITY CHIEVY IN RUSSIA AND HE'S WITTEN A LOT ABOUT SERKOV THIS LIBERAL BLOGE A LITLE FETILOGA HE AD VERY GREEPOPLIPLOG TOOKSOME FODAS OF THE OFFICE AF SERKOV'S OFFICE TH HE WAS THERE TO PHOTOGRAPH AN OFFICIAL MEETING BUT HE SAID ON HIS BLOG THAT HE WAS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT WAS IN THE OFFICE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE THE FONS ON HIS DASK WITH THE NAMES WILL OPPOSITION PINSCLPOSSIS LIKE LITERALLY THERE'S A WHOLE MESS OF PHONES AND ON ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR NEXT TO THE NUMBERS THERE'S A BANK OF BUTTONS LABELED MERANOV ZURNOVSKY ZUGONOV ALL HEADS OF PARTIES AND E HAVE THE PORTRAIT OF TO THE FISO TUPACKA NEXT O LIKE MAKIAVETOU SOMETHING YES TWO POCHIC FOR THE RAPPER IT'S ACTUALLY NEXT TO A PICTURE OF BAROKOBAMA AND A A THE TIME ROS I  MY GOD WHILE WE GOT SEENSISIRKOV'S OFFICE AND THAT MANY YEARS LATES AT WHEN WE EVERE REALIZED THE SIRKLOF AT BEN FUNDING THIS LIBERA AGE AVRAS I OMER WHAT HE LEAKED THAT HE WANTS IT US TO BEEL HIS POWER YOU KNOW AND HE WANTED TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE YOU CAN NEVER REALLY TELL WHAT'S TRUE ANY MORE SO EVERYTHING IS SUSPECT THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY INTENTION ZERKOV HIMSELV HAS COME JUST SHY OF SAYING IT OPENLY A HE TALKS ABOUT IT IN HIS BOOK THIS IS ANOTHER SHAPE SERKOV IS REPORTED TO HAVE SHIFTED INTO HE WROTE A NOVEL UNDER THE SUDINAM NATON DUBOVITZKY HE WON'T ADMIT ITS REALLY HIM BUT SZERKOV'S WIFE IS NAMED NATALIA DUBOVITSKAYA SO EVERY ONE'S LIKE NODY COINCIDENCE THE BOOKS CALLED ALMOST TO ZERO WERE KLOSE TO ZERO IT' ABOUT A PIARGAY WHO GREW UP IN THE STIK LIKE SERKOV DID MOVE TO MOSCOW TO HANG OUT WITH BOHEMIAN ARTISTS LIKE SZERKOV DID AND IS NOW EMBROILED IN THE SEEDY MURDEREUS UNDER WORLD OF THE ILLEGAL BOOK PUBLISHING IN DISTRIBUTION OH AND IT'S GOT AN ENGLISH SUBTITLE GANGSTOFICTION ANY CASE PETER SAYS THERE ARE THESE REALLY TELLING PASSAGEIS IN WHICH THE HERO REALIZES AWAIT EVERYTHING'S MADE UP LANGUAGE POLITICS EVERY IDEOLOGY EVERYTHING'S FAKE I CAN SEE THROUGH IT ALL IT'S AN EPIC KIND OF CENICISM IT'S NALL CITIZEISM AS IN MI OWN O BLEVLYTHING BUT ALMOST IK OLMY GOT IVE BURST THROUG NOR THE SHALLOW SHELLS OF MORALITY AN MIDEOLOGY AND BELIEF SI AM SEEING BEHIND THE MATRIXKYE EXACT VERY MUCH I THE MATRIC OS A SUPERPOPULAR FIMIN RUSSIANAN TAT BUT YOU MAKE SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT RUSSIAN HISTORY AND MEN L THIS GENERATION LIKE CIRCLE WR LIKE PUTSON THE'VE LIFE THROUGH COMMUNISM THEY'VE LIVE THROUGH AND THE MAFHIA STATE THE MISYOU FAK DEMOCRACY THROUGH AS FROM TH RELIGIOUS NATIONAL SOCIALISM AN EMPIBLING WHICH THEY HAVE NOW AND IT'S ALL THE SAME PEOPLE AND THE'VE GONE THROUGH THROUGH SO MANY DIFFERENT MODES OF BEING IN THE LOSTS THATS HE IS IN SUCH BLISTERY PROGRESSION HAT THAT CAND OFE LEFT OF THE FEEDING THAT EVERYTHING IS IS A MOSKRATE SO WHEN ZERKOV SAYS EVERYTHING IS A EVERYTHINGIS CONTROLLED IN A CONSTRUCT WHAT HE'S AT SHE SAYING IS NOT A CONFESSION IT'S AF PIECE OF SYCHOLOGICAL PROPAGANDA TO SAY SO THERE'S NO POINT STRUGGLING FOR ANYTHING DON'T EVEN TRY TO DO ANY OF YOUR CITY YOU KNOW PROTEST MOVEMENTS OH SOT SON AWAY YOU'LL KILLING IF YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT EVERYTHING IS A CONSPIRACY IT DOESN'T LEAD PEOPLE TO REVOLT IT LEADS PEOPLE TO GO GIVE WAS THAT I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE OP YES E BUT AGET WE MIGHT BE OVERINHEPRETI BUT IS A BOOKS  WHERE ALASTI BUT YET IS LIN LIKE I SAID BEFORE SERKOV IS NO LONGER THE GRAND MANAGER OF PROPAGANDA IN RUSSIA HE WAS SIDELINED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AFTER A DISPUTE WITH PUDENN BUT HE STAYED A PERSONAL ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT ANDHE WAS ALSO AN ORGANIZER OF RUSSAS TAKE OVER OF THE KRIMEAN PENINSULA IN OUCRANE AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THAT ANNEXATION GOT HIM SANCTIONED BY THE WEST EANING HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO TRAVEL TO THE UESSOR EUROPE ANY MORE AND HE CAN'T HAVE ASSETS IN THE WEST EITHER ZERKOV WAS UNFAZED THE ONLY THINGS THAT INTEREST ME IN THE UES HE SAID OR TUPOKSHIKOR ALINGEN'SBURG AND JACKSON POLA I DON'T NEED A VEZA TO

NEWSPAPERS IND MAGAZINES AN ALL OF THE ACCOUNTS DIRK STAYED ANONYMOUS HE ONLY DECIDED DO UNMASK HIMSELF FOR THIS STORY CAUSE HE'S NOT DOING IT ANY MORE HE SAYS HE JUST HASN'T HAD TIME FOR ANYTHING SINCE HIS KITS CAME ALONG BUT THE NEWS WORTHINESS OF IT WAS THAT SOME ONE WOULD GO SO VERY FAR OUT OF HIS WAY TO RETRIEVE PROPERTY THAT WASN'T HIS FOR PEOPLE HE DIDN'T KNOW HEAS LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD HAD THE SAME REACTION IS CARRY HELMING HER THE FIRST PERSON DIRK HELPED WHO WAS MENTIONED IN ONE OF THE MAGAZINE PIECES HOW TE LACH IS IN THE ARTICLE HE RI LIKE I THINK SHE THOUGHT I WAS A WEIRD ON A LIKE  I E DELY BIKEOF COURSE THE WHOLE THING SEEMS A LOT LESS WEIRD IF YOU'RE DIRK TO GROOT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE HE FIGURED OUT HOW TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND ONCE HE FIGURED IT OUT HE COULDN'T NOT SOLVE IT BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE WAS DOING IT HE WAS LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT A KIND OF KNEW WHAT TO DO AND IT WAS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T KNOW I GO I DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IF YOU FIND OUR BIK STOLEN ON CREXIST ACTUALLY CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO SPEND YOUR TIME ON THIS PLANET AND TO IDENTIFY SOMETHING THAT'S VEXING SOMEONE ELSE OR LOT OF SOME ONE ELSE'S AND TO PUT YOURSELF INTO THAT GAP BETWEEN THEM AND THE SOLUTION SO TO DANARSHO AND TI TELL YO ABOUT SOME REMARKABLE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT AND WHY THEY DO IT AND HOW IT GOES OR DOSN GDO FOR THEM STAY WITH US THERE'S THE SAME ICH THAT REALLY STUC OF A LOT OF A SERE F TO SHOW HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT IT'S THE POTO OF STROLLERS BABY STROLLERS AT A TRAIN STATION IN POLAND IN SHORT THESE PLISH MOMS ANTICIPATING A PROBLEM THAT YOU CRANIN REFUGEE MOTHERS MIGHT HAVE WHEN THEY CROSSED THE BORDER CLUTCHING THEIR LITTLE KIDS STARTED LEAVING STROLLERS FOR THEM AT DIFFERENT POINTS OF ENTRY IN THE FODO THEY'RE ALL LINED UP ON THE TRAIN PLATFORM SOME FANCY SOME NOT SOME KNEW SOME WITH WARN TIRES EACH ONE A POLISH FAMILY THINKING ABOUT WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE HELPFUL WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS FALLING APART AND PROVIDING IT ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT WAR HAS YIELDED YOU'VE PROABLY HEARD IS THE LACK OF ACCESS AN RUSSIA TO REAL ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON BRUTALITY OF THE WAR ESSENTIALLY THE RUSSIAN PROPAGAN TO BUBBLE TAMPING DOWN ON PUBLIC OPPOSITION WHICH IS WHAT ACT ONE OF TO DAYS SHOAS ABOUT AND IT'S ABOUT SOME ONE ON A PERSONAL MISSION TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM RECALLING THE SACT COLD COLL TO ACTION ITS FROM PREDUCE RELY SPEAGLE POLISO NOTAS SPENT THE FIRST THIRTEEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE IN THE EUESES ARE SO HE KNOWS HOW COMPLICATED I CAN BE TO LIVE IN A WORLD WITH LIMITED INFORMATION THIS WAS LITHAENIA IN THE ADIES AND WHAT POLIS REMEMBERS ABOUT LIVING IN THAT WORLD IS THE DISTRUST AND THE HAZINESS YOU HAD YOUR SUSPICIONS A CREEPING SENSE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT THE NEWS YOU WERE HEARING BUT THERE WAS NO WAY TO KNOW FOR SIRE AND NO ONE AROUND YOU KNEW EITHER SO AFTER PUTEN INVADED YOU CRANE POLIS REACHED OUT TO FRIENDS IN RUSSIA TO TALK ABOUT THE WAR THESE WERE EDUCATED PEOPLE WELL RED PEOPLE BUT THE RUSSIAN VERSION OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING MADE HIS BLOOD RUN COLD THE STORY THEY'D HEARD WAS THAT RUSSIA WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP WITH THE GENESIDE THERE WAS GEN ASIDE THO RUSSIAN PEOPLE GOING ON ALL THE TINE AND SO WE NEED TO TAKE OUT THEIR GOMENT I WE EOPWE WILL NOT YOU TAT THEGON GO ON KILLING RUSSIAN PEOPLE IN THER SO WE HAVE THIS NEED TINY OPERATION MILITARY UPRATION GOING ON THET WE JUST TAKING OFF THE GON IN THE WORLD RUSSIANS KNEW THERE WERE NO PREGNANT MOTHERS DYING ON GERNEES NO LEVELLED CITIES NO DID CIVILIANS AT ALL SOME OF THEM TOLD TELL ME STOIES ABOUT RUSSIANS BRINGING IN FOOD IN INCLOSING FO OUCRANIAS IT WAS A WHOLE PARALEL UNIVERSE OF INFORMATION CONSTRUCTED AND POLICED BY PUTEN POLIS BELIEVES THE FOUNDATIONS OF THAT UNIVERSE ARE MORE FRAGILE THAN THEY LOOK THAT IF THE RUSIAN PEOPLE COULD REALLY SEE NO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THEIR NAME PUTEN'S PATEMPTAN VILLAGE BMIGHT CRUMBLE SOME ONE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING SO RUSSIANS COULD UNDERSTAND THE REAL HORROR OF THE WAR THEY WERE FIGHTING AND THEN ONE DAY PLIS WAS SITTING IN A MEETING AND HIS FUN BEGAN TOBUS IT WAS A FRIEND CALLING TO SAY THAT HE HAD AN IDEA ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT SOLVE THIS RUSSIANS DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE WAR PROBLEM SINCE YOU KNOW POTIS WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT RUSSIA SAY I DONNOT THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT RUSSIA TO ME IS I THEY GOT THE SEN NEMBUS PUBLIC SO YOU JUST GO ON LINE AND YOU CAN'T GET THE HOLD T AT THOS NEMBERS SO WE CAN CALL THEM AS THEY TALKED THE TWO BEGAN TO PIECE TOGETHER A PLAN WHAT IF THEY BUILT A WEB SIGHT WHERE YOU PUSHED A BUTTON AND GOT THE NAME AND TELEPHONE NUMBER OF SOME ONE SOMEWHERE IN RUSSIA RUSSIAN SPEAKERS FROM OUTSIDE PUTEN CEALED UNIVERSE COULD CALL IN TELL RUSSIAN PEOPLE ONE BY ONE PERSON TO PERSON ALL ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON POLIS WORKS AN ADVERTISING HE SPENT HIS LIFE TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING THEY DO NOT CURRENTLY FEEL A NEED TO DO SO HE KNEW THAT HEARING AND AUTHENTIC HUMAN VOICE MAKING A PASSIONATE DAYS CAN BE A VERY POWERFUL WAY TO ALTER SOME ONE'S BEHAVIOR YOU MEN WAT TEN TICITY HAS A LOT OF POWN ITSO JO THE WAY THIS HEARING IT THA PROM PASON WHOSE GENIN IS MUCH MORE PERSUASIVE THAN READING IT ON THE BESIN ESE I'S MUCH MORE LIKELY TO TO TO TO GET THROUGH STILL POLYS WASN'T SURE THAT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA SO MANY RUSSIAN SPEAKERS OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY WERE REALLY ANGRY HE WORRIED IN JUST PE CREATING A TOOL FOR PEOPLE TO SHOUT AT EACH OTHER POLYS HIMSELF WAS STRUGGLING WITH HIS FEELINGS ABOUT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE DO YOU SEE THEM AS VICTIMS OR DO YOU SEE THEM AS COMPLICIT I SO DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THOSE TWO THINGS IT SO DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THOSE THESE THINGS AMI'M I'M TRYING TO TO PUT ALL THE SYMPATHY I HAVE INTO THIS IS IT COMING FROM THE FACT THAT I THING THAS GUNNA CRAT E BRIDGE AND I'M SYNICAL I OT DO I TRULY HAVE SYMPATHY POLYS DIDN'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER WHAT HE KNEW WAS THAT THE SCHEME HAD AT LEAST THE POTENSIAL TO HELP SHIFT THE TIDE SO HE PUT IST OUTS ASIDE AND DECIDED TO GO FORWARD THE POLAS YOU CAN COME UP WITH ALL PROBLEMS YOU WANT YOU KNOW YOU CAN MAKE A PROBLEM THAT DON'T EXIST BUT IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING THTHING WILL HAPPEN PLY SYS THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERKED AROUND THE CLOCK FOR FIVE DAYS UNTIL THE WEBSIDE CALL RUSSIA WENT LIVE ABOUT A WEAK AND A HALF INTO THE WAR THE LANDING PAGE FEATURED A LARGE YELLOW BUTTON WHICH RANDOM LY GENERATED RUSSIAN TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND THE SIDE WAS AN IMMEDIATE HIT POLYS SAYS HE LONG TO THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CALLS IN THE FIRST TWO DAYS STILL IT WASN'T UNTIL WATE ON LAUNCH DAY THAT POLYS HIMSELF WAS APLE TO SIT DOWN AND TRY OUT THIS IDEA HE PRESSED THE YELLOW BUTTON THEN CALLED THE NUMBER THT APPEARED ON HIS SCREEN THE PHONE WAS ANSWERED BY A MA I TOLD THEM WHO I AM AND AND A A A AND HE STOT SHOUTING IMMEDIATE AND I I SAID I DON'T WISH  AND ANYTHING WRONG ANDJUST AN ORDINARY PESON TRYING TO CONNECTTO PEOPLE IN RUSSIA AND I SAID DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE AND HE SHOUTED AT ME THEY A I REMEMBER THAT THER A VILITLY HE SHOUTED ME THEY ARE KILLING UST THERE AND WI TRYING TO SAVE THEM AND HE SAID HE CASED ME ANY HANG UP THE FENCE THAT WAS MY FASE CONVERSATION A FEW CALLS LATER POLYS HEARD THE VOICE OF A WOMAN WHAT

PEOPLE AREN'T IN A SUDDENLY TAKE TO THE STREETS BUT HE FIGURES HE MIGHT NEDGE THEM A LITTLE SO THAT WHEN THEY SEE THEIR NEIGHBORS PROTESTING INSTEAD OF REACHING OUT TO THE POLICE TO LET THEM KNOW THEY MIGHT PAUS ASK THEMSELVES IF THAT'S REALLY THE BEST THING TO DO THAT'S WHY EVEN WHEN SOME ONE IS YELLING PLIS TRIES PERSEVERE EMOTIONALLY HOW HARD IS IT FOR YOU TO WITHSTAND THE SCREAMING AT I SUBON

SINCE THE WEBSID LAUNCHED THEY'VE BEEN TRACKING THE COUNTRY IS WHERE PEOPLE WERE CALLING FROM HE TOLD ME THAT AT FIRST CALLS FROR MOSTLY FROM WHERE HE WAS WITH A WANIA BUT SOON HE AND IS COLLEGUES NOTICED IT WAS SPREADING THE IDEA HOPPING FROM ONE COUNTRY TO THE NEXT UNTIL THEY SAW THAT RUSSIAN SPEAKERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WE'RE REACHING OUT TO THE PEOPLE INSIDE PRUDENCE BUBBLE THEY'D SEEN THE SAME PROBLEM POLISTED AND THEY WERE ALL TRYING THEIR BEST TOES ALL THAT WITH HIM A LE SPEAGLE AS ONE OF THE PRODUCERS OF ORSHA A TO ZO UNTO OTHERS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WAR THERE WERE THIRTY VISITORS TO THE ZUAND KEVY CRANE ON THE NINTH DAY OF THE WAR THERE WERE NONE NO PAYING VISITORS THAT WAS THE DAY WASHINGTON POST REPORTER CHAVON O GRADY AN A COUPLE OF HER COLLEAGUES WENT THERE TO MEET THE ZUKEEPERS CHAVANT HAD BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN EUCRANE WHO WERE STILL WORKING WHILE THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN UNDER SE EGE NOT JUST MILITARY BUT EVERYE DAY WORKERS PHARMISISTS GROCERYSTORE EMPLOYS IT'S THE SAME THOUGHT A LOT OF US HAVE HAD ABOUT ESSENTIAL WORKERS DURING THE PANDEMAC EXCEPT IN THIS CASE THEYE WRE LITERALLY BOMBS GOING OFF AROUND THEM CHE  WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO DO THEIR JOBS NOW UNDER WHAT AR PROBABLY THE MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES POSSIBLE THEY WENT TO THE ZOO IN THE AFTERNOON FOR A FEW RUSHED HOURS BEFORE CURFEW CHVANT SAID WAS EARIE THE GIANT COLORFUL JERAFF STAFCTUE AT THE ENTRANCE AFTER THEY HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL CHECK POINTS TO GET THERE THE WINDING PATHS WERE VERTUALLY EMPTY THE ZOO KEEPERS WERE KEEPING THE ANIMALS INSIDE HARDLY BECAUSE OF THE COLD AND ALSO BECAUSE THE ANIMALS COULD BE KILLED IF THEY CAME OUT FOR SOME EXERCISE THE WRONG MOMENT THE ZOO IS RIGHT NEAR A MILITARY FACILITY THAT MIGHT BE TARGETED BY RUSSIAN FORCES THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT ARRANT MISSILES AND TOD ABOUT FIFTY STAFFERS OUT OF THE USUAL THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE HAD STAYED BEHIND TO LOOK AFTER THE ANIMALS AS CHAVAN WHAT WAS BEHIND THEIR DECISION TO STICK IT OUT THE ONES I SPOKE TO DIDN'T MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A DECISION IT WASN'T AN OPTION THE STAFF MEMBERS REALLY FELT TO RESPONSIBILITY TO STAY  THAT THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THAT THEY WOULD SPEND THE WAR CAUSE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE RIGHT RIGHT LIKE IF THEY LEFT WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN WOULD THERE BE ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE LEAP OVER THE ZOO WALLZO NO THE ANIMALS WOULD DIE FOUR THOUSAND ANIMALS BE LOCKED AWAY IN THEIR PENS AN ENCLOSURES SLOWLY STARVING TO DEATH IF THE HYDRATION DIDN'T GET THEM FIRST AND NOT JUST ANYONE CAN DO THIS JOB IN TAKE SPECIAL SKILL IN KNOWLEDGE THE DIFFERENT ANIMALS DIETARY NEEDS SOME OF THE ANIMALS NEED TO LIVE AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES THAN OTHERS IT'S A HEFTY ENOUGH TASK DURING PEACE TIME AND OF COURSE LOTS OF ASPECTS OF TE JOBB AR DIFFERENT IN A WARS OWN FIRST OF ALL THE ZOO KEEPERS ARE MAINLY LIVING AT THE ZOO WHICH THEY NORMALLY WOULD NOT APPI TO I  AN THE STAFF MOVE SOME OF THEIR FAMILY IS TEN AND THE HEAD OF THE ZOO CURILLO CHANTON MOVED HIS ELDERLY MOTHER INTO THE ZOO WITH HIM TO IN ORDER TO CARE FOR HER AND THE ANIMALS IS IT THAT THEY CAN'T LIVE AT HOME OR THEY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SAFER AT THE ZO IT'S BOTH SO IN SOME CASES MAY BE THEY LIVE IN A PART OF TOWN THAT COULD EVENTUALLY BE CUT OFF ORE MAD VERY DIFFICULT TO GET BETWEEN THE ZOO AND HOME IN WHICH CASE THEY WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AND IT'S ALSO THAT SOME OF THEM LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN TARGETED BY STRIKES ARE THEY SLEEPING WITH THE ANIMALS SO EVERY NIGHT AS STAFF MEMBER HAS BEEN SLEEPING WITH THE ELEPHANT HORACE THE ELEPHANATOO COMFORT HIM BECAUSE ELEPHANTS ARE REALLY SENSITIVE IN GENERAL THEY ALSO HAVE ENORMOUS EARS AND REALLY GOOD HEARING SO THE BOOMS AND THE SIRENS HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY UPSETTING TO HIM TO THE POINT THAT HE'S BEEN PUT ON SETATIVES AND AT NIGHT HE WAS APPARENTLY WAKING OP WALKING AROUND EXIVITTING SIGNS OF ETREME STRESS AND THEY WERE SO WORRIED ABOUT HIM THAT ONE OF THE STAFF MEMBERS HAS VOLUNTEERED TO JUST STAY IN THERE WITH HIM AND SO WHEN HE GET STRESSED AT NIGHT THEY SPEAK TO HIM AN A KIND OF CALMING VOICS THEY FEED HIM HIS FAVORITE SNACKS OF APPLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND JUST KIND OFE TALK HIM DOWN AFTER ANY BOOMS UNTIL HE CAN GO BACK TO SLEEP SOME OF THE STAFFERS IN THEIR FAMILIES OCCASIONALLY SLEEP IN AN ACQUARIUM THAT STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION UNDERGROUND BUNKER LINK CHAVANT TOLD ME YOU COULD ZEE WERE ONE DAY HOPEFULLY WILL BE GLASS IN FIT C BOULD RIGHT NOW THERE ALL KINDS OF COTS WITH PILLOWS AND SLEEPING BAGS ON THEM CHAVAN IMAGINE HOW NICE AND COOL IT'LL BE TO HANG OUT DOWN THERE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS IF AN WHEN THEY CAN FINISH BUILDING IT  DURING THEI TOWR THE ZOO THE ZOO KEEPERS HAND A HVAN AN APPLE AND SHOWEDER HAD A FEET HORAS WE ELEPHANT WITH SLE TROUBLE THEY VISITED TONY THE GORILLA AS ALSO BEEN AGITATED NOT BECAUSE OF THE EXPLOSIONS NECESSARILY HES HAID NO INTERACTION WITH GUESTS AND APPARENTLY MISSES AT LOT AT VISIBLY EXCITED WHEN HIS HAMLER FINALLY SHOWED UP ALSO SPAT OUT HIS LUNCH ALL OVER ONE OF CHIVAN'S COLLEGUES FOR SOME REASON ITHTHE N IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING ONE OF THE ANIMAL HANMLERS WAS FEEDING A BRAND NEW BABY LEAMER HIS INCREDIBLY SMALL SOFT DELICATE THING SPECIALLY COMPARED TO THE CHAOS HIT WAS BORN INTO THEY NAMED HIM BY ROC TAR HICH AS A KIND OF TURKISH DRONE THE GRANIANS ARE DEFLYING AGAINST THE RUSSIANS THER'RE THINKING NAMING HIS SIBLING JAVELIN CHIVAN ASKED THE ZUPKEEPERS WHICH OF THE ANIMALS WERE THE LEAST CONCERN ABOUT ALL THE EXPLOSIONS AND SIRENS THE CROCODILES THEY SAID AND THE ALLIGATOR ALL THEY CURE ABOUT HIS EATING BUT AS INTERESTING AS YOU FOUND THE ANIMALS IT WAS REALLY THE PEOPLE SHE WAS THERE TO LEARN ABOUT ONE OF THE ZUPKEEPERS WHO INTERESTED HER MOST WAS IVAN RIBCHANKO WHOSTILL COM MEDS TO THE ZOU FROM HOME ON HIS BIKE AND I WAS INTERESTED WHEN I SAW HIM BECAUSE HE WAS FEEDING A BANANA TO IT DRAF AND THE ARRAD SIRONS HAD JUST GONE OFF WE COUD HEAR BOOMS IN THE BACKGROUND AND BOTH HE AND THE DRAGHTS JUST DIDN'T REACT AT ALL THEY JUST  CONTINUED WITH THE FEEDING AND HE WAS JUST BEING REALLY GENTLE AND SWEET WITH THE DRAGH AND WE WERE ALL KIND OF LOOKING

THAT HIS RESPONSIBILITY IS THE DRAGTS THE DEER AND HORSES AT THE ZOO AND HIS JOB IS A PUBLIC SERVICE AND THAT'S HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE TO THE FIGHT TO THE WAR EFFERT YE HE REALLY SAW I HE DID WHICH

GOT OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT IT FELT LIKE WAS THIS IS HOW IT GOES WHEN FACE WITH HA CRISIS LIKE THIS GOVERNMENTS WILL MINIMIZE THE SEVERITY OF THE DANGER THEL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS THE FOCUS ON THE

DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TOWING THE PARTY LINE THE NEXT REPUBLICAN COMMISSIONER TO ASK QUESTIONS HE SEEMS MORE THAN READY TO DO THE OPPOSITE WE A A IT'S YOUR FLOR O  THANK YOU IN CAMERA COMMISSIONER ROBERT SPINDELL HE LOOKS LIKE HESE BEING HELD CAPTIVE IN A SUP FLIE ROOM SOMEWHERE HIS AGAINST THIS WHITE WALL THAT HAS NOTHING ON IT INNY MAM PRETTY QUICKLY HE GOES REALLY BIG ON THE WEST CAMPAIGN'S ARGUMENT THAT FIVE O'CLOCK MEANS YOU HAVE RIGHT UP AN TAIL FIVAL WONTIM OU KNO ON YOUR POINT ABOT I SA JUST FIVE O'CLOCK FIVE O'CLOCK I DE A LOT OF A SY AN TRY AN TO FLINP SOMETHING AND THERE'S NO REAL E FEALET OF ACT OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES SPINDL MAKES A MEMBER OF CREATIVE ARGUMENTS TRYING TO HELP THE CINA WEST LAWYER THING YES LIK HE SAYS SINCE THE PETITIONS ENTERED THE BUILDING AT FIVE O'CLOCK AND FOURTEEN SECONS WELL IFOURTEEN SECONDS SINCE FLESS THAN HALF A MINUTE SO THAT REALLY ROUNDS BACK DOWN TO FIVE PIAN SHARP BRAY THE MAN HAT'S JUST SOMETHIN MA IN IN AROUND A ROUND YOU TI FERS SOS PINDEL ALSO QUESTIONS WHETHER THE LEST CAMPAIGN TANIS ACTUALLY HAD TO TURN IN THE PETITIONS IN ORDER FOR THE PETITIONS TO BE TURNED IN AS Y NDER STAND THESEE IN ER SUSTAN GOT ON TH ELLEVATER A WERE THE STAFF PIRSON JUST THE THREE ON I WHICH YOU ACK THO SIRT OF THE TAT COULD BE  SRAMPS FER A A A DOCUMENTS IT THAT TIME THET ONCE THE DOOR CLOSE TO THE ALLBY TO BE CLEAR SPINDELL IS CONTENDING THAT  BEING IN THE ELEVATER VET THE STAFF MEMBER AND NOT HANDING THE STAFF REMEMBER THE DIUMENS IS THE SAME AS BEING IN THE OFFICE AND PHYSICALLY TURNING THE MEN CAN I SAY THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE ACTION OF ALL THIS PLAYS OUT ON ZOOME WITH ALL THE NORMALS WHOMHE INTERRUPTIONS IT FEELS INTIMATE ONE COMMISSIONER KEEPS DROPPING OFF THE CALL AT ONE POINT THERE'S A CAT BUT THET POPS INTO A FRAME NEXT TO A COMMISSIONER ASKING QUESTIONS AND ALSO WHEN PEOPLE GO AT EACH OTHER IT FEELS MORE PERSONAL SOMEHOW BECAUSE YOU JUST SEE THEM AND THEY'RE IN THEIR HOMES LIKE AND JACOBS THE CHAIR A FEW TIMES SHE GETS IN TO IT A SPINDELL AND YOU SEE HER AND WHAT I THINK IS HER LIVING ROOM SHE'S WEARING PEARLS AND SHE' SITTIG IN FRONT OF A FIREPLACE AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE A SILVER TEASET EYE SO IT'S WAY LESS LIKE A DEBATE IN SOME BRANDOM GOVERNMENT BUILDING OR WHATEVER AND MORE LIKE FAMILY MEMBERS GETTING IN A FIGHT ON THE PONE OR SOMETHING I LIKE TO MAKE FOM RER MEMBER I DO AT YOU CAN YOU LIHE THINK  AT INCE  I I LIKE TO MAKE A FEMTE EMOTION THAT WE  MOTION AT  IR  A I THAT IS THAT I GOOD IM SIR NO  JUST WAIT BUT SO I STILL HAVE BEEN GOT INTO THE MOST MEMORABLE PARTS OF A SPINDELL SPEECEFYING  HE STARTED WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT COVETI WHICH YOU SIR I E GREE THE THE PANDAMIC EAS MADE WHY AND EVERYTHING ELSE MUCH HARDER YES TE SITUATION LIKE THIS WERE THE BAN DAC MAKES THINGS HARDER AND ERE EVERYTHING ELSEI THERE'S GREAT EFFORTS TO IN YELECHIN FROCESS IS TO TRY AND MAKE THE PROCEEDS OUR UASER FOR ALL OFOS  THEN YOU ARE WIC YOURGERY THER WE E SHOULD TRY AND MAKE IT LOE EUSER SPINDELL'S ESSENTIALLY MAKING IN ARGUMENT THAT DEMOCRACYS TAKES MORE TIME WEARING A PANDEMI  AND SO PEOPLE SHOULD GET MORE TIME TO DO SAN WITH SOMEBODY WHICH  MAM THAT'S JUST PA ASPINDEL FOR A SECOND HERE BECAUSE THE WISCONSIN GIO P HAS SYSTEMATICALLY STAKED OUT POSITIONS TO DO THE OPPOSITE THIS YEAR WISCONSTIN CONSERVATIVES HAE FOUGHT THE IDEA OF GIVING MORE TIME FOR EARLY VOTING AN ABSENTEA VOTING IN APRIL REPUBLICANS ALSO MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY OPPOSED POSTPONING AN ELECTION DO TO COVET INCLUDING ROBERT SPINDELL WHO SAID COVID WAS NO REASON TO POSTPONE AND ELECTION STILL SPENDELL HAD ONE MORE ARGUMENT TES CAPS AN DAMA RAPS WHICH IS WHICH IS THE PEOPLE  O BRINGING THE A CHALLENGE I MY MI WORSON WHY THEY GAIN STOPS QUESTION THE BACK F A HER THEY WISH TO TAKE AWAY FOM  WET BY TOPUWATION ON OPPORTUNITY TO  TAK A BLACK WWAS THE MANCHAL CANOF THE OBTHE GAL YO TBU CHOICE UBS O WHO THEY WANT BOT FORS AN ALL WHATS LABSAN TERNS OF TRY O TOEXPRESSLY THE BLAK CHOICE THIS IS WHERE THE MEETING TRULY BENT MY MOUND AS IF IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR DEMOCRATS TO SUPPRESS BLACK VOTERS NATIONALLY EIGHTY SEVEN PRESENT OF THEM IDENTIFY AS DEMOCRATS I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK WATCHING THIS THAT HERE WE ARE IN THE THROES OF THE SIZEMIC ELECTIONS I GO ONE IN WHICH LOTS OF PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES ARGUE THAT THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE THE'RE OUT TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY IT FEELS HUGE IT'S WE ARE TO THINK THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTION PROCESS OVER THE COMING WEEKS WELL HINGE ON WHAT HAPPENS IN SO MANY ROOMS LIKE THIS UN TINY SCREENS LIKE THIS WIT PUBLIC SERVANTS AND VOLUNTEERS AND CAMPAIGN WORKERS WILL BE WRESTLING OVER RULES AND DEAD LINES AND SIGNATURES AND POSTMARKS THIS VIDIO IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF A NEAK PREVIEW AND HONESTLY I THINK WILL BE LUCKY IF IT LOOKS LIKE THIS MEETING ABSURD IS A GOT AT TIMES I RESPECT THIS SO MUCH THESE COMMISSIONERS ARE PAID A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MEETING AFTER WE HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS TO PREPARE FOR THIS AND THEY WENT AROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND SPLITTING THIS FOURTEEN SECOND HAIR EVERY WHICH WAY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME PEOPLE WERE THOUGHTFUL AND THEY WERE WILLING TO STEP ACROSS PARTY LINES IF THAT'S WHAT THEY HAD TO DO TO GET TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS FAIR MOSTLY THEY SEEMD LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT AND IN THE END A VERY SIMPLE ARGUMENT ONT OUT THET WAS PRECEDENT NOW LOTS OF  MANY PEOPLE HAD MISSED DEAD LINES IN THE PASSINCE WHETHER BY LOT OR LITTLE THEY JUST COULDN'T ACCEPT IT I THOUGHT I THE MOTION IS CARRIED FIVE TO ONE TAND JUST LIKE THAT AN KINY WEST WAS OFF FUL WISCONSIN BALLAT THE REMAINDER OF THIS VIDIO IS WORTH MENTIONING IF YULJUST GIVE ME ONE MORE MENUTE HERE I'LL SUMM IT UP FOR YOU WILL CINY WEST CAMPAIGN MADE THE HEADLINES THE NEXT DAY THE WISCONSIN ELECTIONS COMMISSION ALSO MADE ANOTHER DECISION THAT NIGHT ONE WITH THE POWER TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE ALSO ON THE AGENDOF THAT EVENING WAS A CHALLENGE SEEKING TO BUMP THE GREEN PARTY CANDIDATES OFF THE BALLAT ON SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY PRETTY TECHNICAL SEE DURING WIS CONSINCE SIGNATURE COLLECTION PERIOD THE V P CANDIDATE FOR THE GREEN PARTY SEEMS TO HAVE MOVED SO HER ADDRESS AT THE BEGINNING IT DOESN'T MATCHER PAPER WORK AT THE END RE PUBLICANS WERE LIKE THAT'S IN THE PICKY B S BUT THE DEMOCRATS WOULDN'T BUDGE AND THE END RESULT THE GREEN PARTY WAS GONE JUST LIKE WEST REMOVE FROM THE BALLAT AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR TO SEE THE ENORMOUS STAKES OF THAT DECISION YOU REMEMBER HOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN DONALD TRUMP ONE WISCONSIN BY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND VOTS THAT YEAR THE GREEN PARTY CANDIDATE JOSTEINE SHE GOT THIRTY ONE THOUSAND VOTS AND WAS CONS BANCAHEN IS ONE OF PRICES OF USHOW AFTER THIS MEETING  THE CONNO WEST CAMPAIGN IN THE GREEN PARTY CANDIDATES BOTH SU THE WAS CONSANT ELECTIONS COMMISSION TRYING TO GET ON THE ALLAT THE GREAN PARTY WENT TO THE STATESPRANE QUIET AND LOST SO NO GREEN PARTY AND THE CONNA WEST CAMPAIGN'S LOST SUIT A JODGE ALSO RODE NOW JUDGE JOHNS COSKAY GIVE FINAL WORD ON THE DEBATE OVERTHE MEANING OF TIME AND HAS WRITTEN DECISION QUOT THE COURT BELIEVES AT THE CIMEO GRANDFATHER CACK RINGS OUT FIVE TIMES IS THE MOMENT IT IS F P WHAT USY NOW IT YOUF MIDNIGHT THERE'S SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELEVEN FIFTY NINE FIFTY NINE PI AND ONE SECOND AFTER MIDNIGHT THE PASSAGE OF A SECOND AFTER MIDNIGHT E FIRST AN ENTIRELY NEW DAGY NOTHER WORDS QUOT THE CORT FINDS O BASICALLY FIVE O'CLOCK IS FIVE O'CLOCK     A THREE MANY THING SHE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAN WHAT AR PRODUCERS DIAN WO SPEND MOST OF E LIFE THINKING THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE A UNIQUEAND PERSONAL TAKE ON THE FILM THE SOUND OF MUSIC E SOUND O MUSIC AFTER ALL IF READY LOVES IT WHAT'S HER TO SAY ND THEN YHOU OR NOW HER TIGE IS VERY DIFFERENT I WATCHED THE SOUND OF MUSIC ALL THE TIME AS IT KID IT WAS ONE OF MAYBE SIX W  CHSS TAPES WE HAD AT HOME ALONG WITH BANBY AN HUNDRED ONDELMACIONS AND A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS TALCONG WITH HA FRIEND ABOUT HOW MUCH I LOVED THE MAYBE GOING UP AND HE SAID ME TOO THOUGH THE NOT SEA SCARED ME AND I SAID WHAT NOT SEASE AND THAT'S WHEN I LEARNED I'D NEVER SEEN THE SECOND HALF OF THE FILM IT TURNS OUT THE MOY CAME OUT IN A TWO V  CS BOCK SET AND I FOR SOMORIES AND HAD ONLY EVER SEEN THE FIRST TAPE MY DAD DOESN'T REMEMBER A SECONER AND WHY WOULD YOU NEED ONE THE FIRST HALF MAKES PERFECT SENSE ON IT SOM HERE'S THE PLOCK IT'S A MOVY ABOUT A WOMAN NAME MARIA WHO WAS SENT TO THE COUNTRY SIDE TO BABYS SAT A GIANT FAMILY OF CHILDREN WITH TA MEAN DAD THE BON TRAPS MARIA SHOWS UP UBBLY FUN AND TEACHES THEM TO SING AND PLAY AND BEKIALL AGAINST THE WISHES OF HER FATHER BUT THE SINGING WHENCE IM OVER THEY SING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY AND FINALLY AT A PARTY THE KID SING A BEAUTIFUL SONG FOR THE GUESTS FAREWELL AND AFTER THAT MARIA HAVING SUCCESSFULLY FIX THE FAMILY LAVES JUST LIKE MARY POPINSTID WHEN SHE FIXED THAT FAMILY AND THAT'S THE END OF THE MOVY I HAD VERY CLEAR FINE MEMORIES OF THE GOAT HEARD PUPPET SHOW AND THE SEEN AN THE GAZIBO WERE LEASEL THE OLDEST DAUGHTER SECRETLY MET WITH THE MALE MAN SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH AND THEY SANG AND DANCED AND IT WAS SO ROMANTIC I HAD NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE CHARACTERS SO WHEN I LEARNED THAT THERE WERE SEVENTY MORE MINUTES TO THE FILM I DIDN'T BOTHER GOING TO LOOK FOR THEM THE SOUND OF MUSIC WAS A FULL COMPLETE AND WONDERFUL ARTIFACT FROM MY CHILDHOOD I DIN'T WANT A TAINT IT WITH NOT SEASE BUT WHEN MY CHERKER LENA WHO'S PRODUCING THES WEEK SHOW AND IS A MUSICAL THEATR FAN WHICH I MOST DEFINITELY AM NOT WHEN SHE FOUND OUT I STILL HADN'T SEEN THE WHOLE THING IT SEEMED HERETICAL TO HER SHE COULDN'T LET IT STAND SO WE WATCHED IT TOGETHER OVER THE INNER NET ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND I PREPARED TO HAVE A CHILDHOOD MEMORY EITHER SLIGHTLY ENHANCED OR COMPLETELY RUINED BEFORE WE STARTED SHE HAD ME PREDICT WHAT WAS GOING TO BE IN THE SECOND HALF A WHY BASE SOT AND THIS IS BASED ON MY CHILDOOD MEMORY AND JUST LIKE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WIS IT'S  THE SECOND HALF IS JUST FOCU AHIN MY FAVOURITE TWO CHARACTERS LEASEL AND THE HOT MAL MAN I WANT TO SEE THEIR COURT SHIP AND AND THEN THEY GET MARRIED AND THAT THE END OF THAT THE MOVY WE HAD PLAY AND STARTED AT THE VERY BEGINNING STARTED WITH EA PARTIN NOW AND THE FIRST HALF WAS MORE OR LESS THE SIMPLE SUNNY MOVY I REMEMBERED SEEING THE KINDLY AND DOWER NONS COME ON SCREEN EARLY ON WAS LIKE RECOGNIZING TEACHERS I HAD IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL REPER NOE SHESTEVERY I SIMPLY CANOT CIN  ARE THERE IS THAT GAZI ROSIAN WHEN THE MALE MAN AND LEASEL SING TO EACH OTHER IN SIX TE IY IN SEVENTY NI OI NI THEN WHIRL AROUND THE GAZIBO DANCING OI A THE STILL LEX LIX SO MU I WATCHING NOW THOUGH I SAW A LOT OF THINGS THAT I HAD COMPLETELY MISSED AS A KID BECAUSE AS A CHILD I'D APPARENTLY IGNORED ANYTHING THAT ADULTS WHO WERE NOT MARIA SAID TO EACH OTHER LITERALLY NONE OF THAT DIALOGUE REGISTERED WAS LIKE THE MUMBLY GROWN UP SIN CHARLEY BROUND MY KID SELF HAD EDITED FULL CHARACTERS OUT OF THE FILM I BARELY REMEMBERED THE BARONESS WHO WANTS TO MARRY THE DAD THIS REALL IS EXCITING FOMMY GALE BE HERE WITH YOU TRES WOD MO USHO WONTUTABLE THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEAD YOU DO IT SO ANY OF THEIR PLOTLINES THAT WERE NOT RESULVED IN THE FIRST HALF WUT I

THO WATCHING AGAIN I HAVE TO SAY THE MAILMAN WAS NOT AS CUTE AS I REMEMBERED IT'S THE MAL MAD O HE CANALECS LICE AN MATSY RALPH THE MAL MAN COMES BACK LATER IN THE FIRST HALF TO THROW ROCKS ON LEASEL'S WINDOW THAT MOMENT I REMEMBER AGAIN SO DREAMY BUT THE ONE THAT FOLLOWED WAS COMPLETELY OVER MY HEAD AS A KID I DN SEE I MAN IT DIDN'T NOL YOUR HIL ITLER HLL HITLER YE HILL HITLER THE HERO OF MY VERSION OF THE SOUND OF MUSIC WHO I'D HOPED THE SECOND HALF WOULD CENTER AROUND HE WAS THE NOTSY ALSO NOT THE MAL MAN YES HE WAS WEARING A UNIFORM AND DELIVERING MESSAGES BUT HE WAS NOT EMPLOYED BY THE POSTAL SERVIS AS MY CHILDSELF HAD UNDERSTOOD HE WAS SOME KIND OF MILITARY MESSENGER THE FIRST HALF IS PEPPERED WITH A HUMOR HINCE LIKE THIS THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO TAKE A TURN HIISTORICALLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE MOVY UNEASY TALK ABOUT AUSTRIAN FLAGS AND SOMETHING CALLED AN UNSLUSE BUT ALL AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A GLAMOROUS PARTY THE KIND OF EASY TO MISS IF YOU'RE SEVEN THE LAST THING I MISSED AS A KID THE BIG TITLE CARD THAT SAYS INTERMISSION IN YELLOW SCRIT THAT COMES ON SCREEN AFTER MARIA CLOSES THE DOOR MAYBE WAS ON A SECOND BAGTESS   LENA AND I FASTE FORWARD THROUGH THE MUSIC AT INTERMISSION AND THE SECOND HAVE STATS I DADLY A IAS ILAIS II SI EERRE FOR YO A THIS REALY BEARD YOU HAVNTHING AN TIS FIE ICSI SEPT DOES THE SECOND HALF STARTS I SUDDENLY FEEL LIKE I HAVE SEEN ALL OF THIS WATCHING THE TILDREN PLAYBALL ON THEIR BACKYARD FELT STRANGELY FAMILIAR SIX I'D SPENT SO MUCH TIME ALREADY WAS AFON TRAPS AT THEIR HOME THAT THIS NEW SCENE JUST FELT LIKE PART OF MY MEMORIES THIS CONFUSING DAJAVO STICKS WITH ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SCENES OF MARIA BACK AT THE ABBEY IT'S NOT UNTIL THE DAD GOES TO MEET MARIA AT THE GAZIBO AND DECLARE HIS LOVE FOR HER THAT I AM CERTAIN I HAVE

THE FIRST TALF THE CHARACTERS MEANWHILE ARE DEALING WITH THEIR OWN WITH FLASH RALPH SURPRISEIS LEASEL AS SHE'S GETTING INTO A CAR RASEL REASEL O RAL IME BASICALLY AS EXSITED TO SEE RALPH AS LEASEL IS RIGHT HERE TBECAUSE MAYBE THIS IS WHEN WE GET TO THE VERSION OF THE SECOND HALF I'D BEEN WANTING TO SEE RALPHIN LEASELES CORTSHIP RALPHAN SO CAD TO SEE YOU AN GDOCTIN YOU WILL TAKE THIS PLEACE AND TO

COME OVER TO NIGHT DI DE RICESI I'M NOW OCCUPIED WITH MORE IMPORTANT MATIT AND YOUR FATHER BETTER BE TOOIBE KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD FOR BUT RAL ALWEYS SAL EUCHOSE A BAD ONE THIS WAS THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP IN THE MOVY THAT INTERESTED ME AT ALL IS A CHILD AND IT SOBERING TO SEE THE WHOLE REALISTIC ARK OF IT AS FOR THE REST OF THE SECOND HALF IT'S PREDICTABLE YOU KNOW THEIR FIRST ESCAPE IS IN CAN A WORK OUT IT'S OBVIES THEL WHEN THI SINGING CONTEST GREAT SONGS FROM THE FIRST TAFFAR JUST RESYCLD IN A WEARD WAY THE ONE MOMENT THAT MOVES ME THOUGH DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CHARACTERS I WAS ATTACHED TO FROM THE FIRST TAF IT HAPPENS SURPRISINGLY WHEN THE DAD STARTS SINGING A LOVE SONG TO HIS COUNTRY ON STAGE      MHE'S DOING IT AS AN ACTIVE GENTLE DEFIANCE THAT MAKES THE NOTS EE IFFICIALS MUSTACHE TWITCH AND AS THE CROWD JOINS IN WITH HIM I FEEL MY THROAT CATCH A LITTLE THEY REMIND ME OF PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD TO SUMMER IN HONCONG THEY ROTE BELLEROUS HERE AN AMERICOUT WE ARE LONGING TO HOLD ON TO SOMETHIT AS THEIR OWN COUNTRY'S CHANGE RAPIDLY EXCRUCIATINGLY AROUND THEM   THE DARKEST MOMENT OF THE MOVY IS PERHAPS AT THE VERY END WHEN THE FAMILY HAS ALMOST ESCAPE BUT THEN RALPH FINDS THEM IN THE ABBEY HE RAISES A WHISTLE TO TURN THEM IN BUT THE DAD STOPS AND REASONS WITH HIM YOU ONT REALLY BELONG TO THEM STE RE WAL COME AWAY WITH US AC RALPH LOOK SCARED AND TOYISH HE REALLY CUSHES HIS GUN AND LEANS OVER RELIEVED BUT THEN THE DAD TAKES AT ONE STEP TOO FAR YOU'LL NEVER BE ONE OF THM WOA RALPH CHOOSES TO BETRAY THEN IT SUCH A SINISTER AND TI SINET SCENE HELD UP AGAINST THE COTTON KANDY FIRST HALF THE FAMILY STILL MAKES IT OUT IN TIME BUT IN SPITE OF HIM NOT WITH HIS HELP AND THAT'S THE ACTUAL END OF THEM IY AS FAR AS I KNOW TOTE  SO HERE IS MY CONCLUSION

WORST CHARACTER THE DAD AND MAKES HIM A HERO THERE ARE BARELY ANY NEW SONGS MARIA DISAPPEARS AS A PERSON WEASLD JUST LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE THE WHOLE TIME TRYING TO ACT LIKE A CHILD FOR ANOTHER HOUR TEVERYTHING MEMORABLE AND I CONIC ABOUT THE MOVY MY FAVOURITE THINGS THE KID SINGING GOOD NIGHT DO A DEAR THAT'LL HAPPENS IN THE FIRST HALF BUT THEN I WAS AT THE BEACH THIS WEEKEND WITH HE FRIEND STARING AT THE CLOUDS IN THE KIDS TERING SAND AND HE SAID A THING THAT CHANGED MY FEELING ABOUT THE SECOND HALF HE TOLD ME THAT LATELY HE CAN LAST ABOUT THREE MINUTES FEELING LIKE EVERYTHING IS NORMAL BEFORE HE REMEMBERS IT ISN'T IT MADE ME UNDERSTAND THE URGED TO INCLEARE THE DARK END OF THIS STORY AND THE MOVY ABOUT THE SINGING FAMILY BECAUSE ONCE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD HIS CHANGED HE CAN'T

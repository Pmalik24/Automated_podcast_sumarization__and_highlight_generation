FAR IT OS CRUCO THE ELECTION FARIA FLARIDA FLORIDA ONE O THE PEOPLE WHO THNKS ABOUT THAT A LOT IS CEAVEN SHEEKY HE'S THE GOT IS JOB BIT IS TO SPEND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE BILLIONER MIKE BOONBRIG IS DEVOTED TO WINNING FOR ITAR FOR JOBIDON CHIGI IS NOT INTIMITED BY THAT TASK AT ALL HE SPEND LOTS OF WOINBRIG'S MONEY IN THE PAST HE RAN BOONBROGS THREE SUCCESSFUL RUNS FOR NEW YORK MAYOR AND IS CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT THIS YEAR AND TAN MI CLIC TO SAY A HE GAVE ME ANOHER MEN OF BUGIN LI SEE THER EACH IN EVERY TIME I I AS YOEU DON'T INTEND TO TO THAT AV ORIDE SO WHY FLARIDA OF ALL THE BATTLE GROUND STATES WHY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THERE CGAVEN EXPLAIN THAT A BIG PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT'S GAN O HAPPEN IN OTHER STATES HE POINTED TO ALL THE TIMES TWEETS AND IN SPEECHES THUT THE PRESIDENT IS SAID THAT MAL AN BALLATS CANNOT BE TRUSTED DONAL TRUMP HAS SOUGHT TO I PEOPLE GEN A TIMES ALL BAL AND MAL AND BALTS A FULSTOP AAND IS CLEARLY WILL HAVE A PLAN TO CONTEST THOSE BALLATS AFTER ALECTION DAY AS THEY ARE COUNTED A IN IMPORTANT SWING STATES SUCH AS MICHIGIN AND PENNSYLVANIA WHICH JOBIN IS CURENLY LEADING IN MICCI GAN WOULD TAKE AT LEAST THREE DAYS TO COUNT THER BALLATS TENSYLVAN IS NOT MUCS DIFFERENT TRUMPET SAID WIS SOMMI TAKE EVERYWHORE NEVERY JUDGE I HAVE A NOT A QUESTION EVERY SINGLE BOUT AND TRY TO TRUSS THEM OUT AND JUST THROWING OUT BOUTS BY RANDOM COULD REALLY MOVE THOR STATES FROM BINE TO TRUMP THAT'S BECAUSE MORE DEMOCRATS OR DOING MAL AND BALLATS THAN REPUBLICANS IDE THIS YEAR BLOOMBURGS PEOPLE OF ACTUALLY RUN THE NUMBERS AN CALCULATED THEIR ESTATES WITH THROWING OUT SEVEN PER CENT OF THE BALLATS AT RANDUM FOR NOT BEING FILLED OUT CORRECTLY WHICH WILL ABIDING VICTORY IN THAT STATE TO A TRUMP VICTORY AND THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS PROPOSITION AND THAT'S WHAT WERE TRYING TO FORIT BY GETTING INTO FLORIDA FAR IT DOS A STATE THE DONO TRUMP PRETTY MUCH HASS TO WIN IF HE LOSES FAR AT IT WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY DIFFICULT FOR HM TO GATHER IN OUF ELECTORAL VOTS TO HAVE REELECTION AND THIS IS KEY FAR IT DOES A STATE THE COUNTS MAL AND BALLATS AS THEY ARRIVE THE COUNTING THEM RIGHT NOW ALREADY WHICH MEANS WE VERY WELL COULD KNOW THE RESULTS AN FORITE ON ELECTO NIGHT AND A FAR ITO GOES TO BIDON IT MIGHT SETTLE THE RACE THAT NIGHT AN ARS OM H CALLS TO WEN T STATE O FLORDACE SO THAT WE QUITE FRANKLY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THAT FIGHT IN STATE LIKE PENNSYLVANIAN SO HOWD YO PICK A HUNDRED MILLION WHAT WAS THAT DISCUSSION LI AH YENA YOU WIS IF I SATE A IT WAS ULTIMATELY WHAT WE DETERMINED WE WOULD NEED AH IT WAS O THE NUMBER THAT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE I CALLED  GI I KNOW WHO IS PROBABLY TI SMARTES A SRATIGE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND I ASK HIM HOW MUCH WHICH YOU NEED TO STAND IF YOU ONE I JA TO BE ABWILE HAVE AN INTACT ON A RACE STATE WY RACEON A PRESENTIAN FLORAND HOW MUCH WOULD YOU NEED TO REALLY PUT YOUR TOMP ON THIS CALE AND HE SAID AT A TIME  WILLIAN A PORSION EX STRORDINARLYCMENTS O STANE IT HAS A LOT A A LARGE EXPENSIV MEENING MARKGTS ENDER AND TO HAVE ANY SORT OF IN TAT YOU REALLY NEED TOSPEND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO PUT YURE OM ON THE SCALE A YOU'RE INY TO SPEND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS AH AND SO THIS BEING BOOMBURG WE ROUND IT UP MEST OF THAT BOONBIG MONEY IS GOING TO DEETY ADS AND DIYOLADS DROPPED INTO CITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE LIKE A VAST AIR WARF CONDUCTED ROM THIRTY THOUSAND FEET CEVCHIGI SAYS BOOMBURGS DOING DAILY POLLING O SEE WHAT EFFECT THIS AS HAVING EXACTLY GON A HARD TO FIGURE OUT ALL KINDS OF THNGS PUSH VOTE OR OPINION AROUND UC CEVEN SAYS THE NUMBERS AND FARITO HAVE MOVE FROM A TIE BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDON TO A SMALL BIDON WEED BHAT STILL WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR BUT IT'S LEAD TWO TO FOUR POINTS UT THE BOONBURG PEOPLE FIND ENCOURAGING SO THAT'S THE VIEW FROM THIRTY THOUSAND FEET DOW ON THE GROUN N AND ALL AS O LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING SO BASIC AND THAT'S THE CORONE OF VIRIS AND HOW THE TWO CAMPAIGNS A RESPONDED TO THE CROWN OF IRIS AS YOU MAY KNOW OVER THE SUMMER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY POLICY WAS DO NOT GO TO TO DOOR DO NOT HOLD EVENTS IN PERSON DO NOT HOLD RALLIES REPUBLICANS DID ALL THAT STFF AND FAR THR EVEN BEFORE THE VIRUS THEY WOERE DOING MORE AN REGISTERING MORE VOTERS THAN THE DEMOCRATS IN SURE NUMBERS THERE ARE MORE REGISTER DEMOCRATS IN THE STATE THAN REPUBLICANS BUT SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE RE PUBLICANS OFE NOK THAT LEAD DOWN USED TO BE SEVEN PER CENT NOW IT'S JUST THREE AND A HALF PERCENT PORTER THE VOTERS IN THE STATE HAVE NO PARTY OF VILIATION SO THE RE PUBLICANS WERE GOING STRONG BEFORE THE VIRUS AND AFTER THE VIRUS TOF THE STATE THEY RESUMED NORMAL OPERATIONS BUT T DEMOCRATS WHENE NOT GOING OUT TOE CAMPAIGN ITWAS LIKE ONE PARTY WAS OUT THERE IN THE STREETS VISIBLE AND THE OTHER WAS JUST NOT ONEOF OUR PRODUCERS LENIMIT SISES THIS BEN TALKING TOFAR TO DEMOCRATS ABOUT ALL THAT AND WENA HOW THE FEELING NOT GREAT ARLY SOMETHING ONE THAT I TALK TOO I'M A CASE OF THERES IS ONE VOTER I FOUND MARCE

COUPLE AND THE FUTURE THEY KOND OF CHEERFULLY THREW THEMSELVES TOWARDS AND AFTER SAY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO MENTS LIKE A HAND GRENADE THEY BRING INTO THEIR OWN HOME PULL THE PIN AND THEN WAIT TO SEE WHAT IS NEXT AND ONE IMPORTANTHING ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS IS THAT WHEN THEY DID THIS THE KIND OF COUPLE THEY WERE WAS IT REALLY GREAT COUPLE WE WERE ALWAYS LIKE THE MOST SOLID OF ALL RELATIONSHIPS OF OUR FRIENDS IND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT CRICK BROWN A WERE MET HIS GIRL FRIEND ON THE THIRD DAY OF COLLEGE AND IN ALL OF THE WAYS THAT WE THINK OF WHAT MAKES HER A GOOD RELATIONSHIP I THINK THAT THEY WERE DOING BETTER THAN YOU OR ME OR MOST PEOPLE THEY HAD A LAT FUN TOGETHER THEY COULD TALK ABOUT ANYTHING THEY DIDN' REALLY FIGHT HAPPY SEX LIFE WAS WE REALLY JUST GOT ALONG VERY WELL TOGETHER WE TRAVELLED WELL THOGETHER YOU KNOW WE WERE ALWAYS THE KIND OF WE WERE THE PLACE OF FRIENDS WOULD COME WHEN THEY ARE HAVING HARD TIMES AND THY WOULD STAY WITH US AND WE WERE KIND OF IT FELT LIKE VERY ADULT WHEN EVEN WHEN I WAS TWENTY THREE FELT LIKE I'M KIND OF MARRIED EVEN THOUGH NEITHER OF US HAD EVER EVER DISCUSSED GETTING MARRIED SO WHAT HAPPENED WELL AFTER WE HAD BOTH TURNED THIRTY AM ONE DAY I JUST KIND OF WAS THINKING ABOUT WHY WE HAD NEVER TALKED ABOUT GETTING MARRIED LIKE WE HAD NEVER EVER TALKED ABOUT IT SERIOUSLY OR OTHERWISE AND WHENEVER ANY ONE WOULD ASK US WE WOULD ALWAYS JUST KIND OF KIND OF BRUSHAT OFTEN SAY I WOLL WORKG IN A WHAT WILL GET MARRY WHEN WE HAVE KIDS THAT'S WHAT WOULD ALWAYS SAY AND I REMEMBER WE WERE SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM AND WAS OCTOBER AND I JUST SAID HEY I WANT O TALK AND I SA WHY YOU KNOW WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVEN'T GOT MARRIED YET OR EVEN TALKED ABOUT IT AND SHE JUST KIND OF LIKE LOOKED AT ME AND AND THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN SHE SAID WELL I THINK THAT BEFORE WE GET MARRIED WE SHOULD PROBABLY SLEEP WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND A AND THAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT WUD COME LIKE AS A HUGE LIKE SHOCK TO ME LIKE HIT ME HARD BUT FOR SOME REASON KIND OF IT MADE SENSE TO ME A I KIND OF WAS LIKE GALL KI VERY CALMLY AND I GUESS THE REALA HOW DID THAT MAKE SENSE I'VE THOUGHT OF LOT ABOUT THIS AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A FEW REASONS WE BOTH HAD THIS KIND OF ARR AGAIN NOTION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP THAT IT COULD SURVIVE LITERALLY ANYTHING THAT WE HAD B IN TO GET WE WE HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER OUR WHOLEDOLE LIVES WE WERE WE WERE EACH OTHER'S WORLD SO REALLY WE I DON'T THINK WE SHAU THAT WE COULD DESTROY THIS THING I DONT TO THE GIRL FRIEND WHO DID NOT WANT TO COME ON TO MEDIO AND SHE SAID BASTICALLY SHE'D ONLY HAD TWO BOY FRIENDS IN A LINE OUR HIGH SCHOOL BOY FRIEND WHO WAS NOT A TE BOYFRIEND AT ALL KIRT WHOT WAS GREAT BUT SHE MET KIRTSHE SAID WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN SHE WAS THIRTY WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND SHE SAID THAT YHE FELLOW MAY BE SHE MISSED OUT ON SOMETHING IN AR TWENTIES EEXPERENCES AT OTHER PEOPLE HAD AND SHE DON HON O REGRET THEN  WENNING  I SHOULD SAY BEFORE WE GOANY FURTHER IN THI STORY WE COLD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE OF SEX BETWEEN A DONTS A NOTHINGS WAS SO THEY SAT ON THE COUCH AND THEY TALK THIS THROT THE NEXT PART OF THAT CONVERSATION WAS THE LEGISTICS DO WE BREAK UP DO I MOVE OUT DO WE JUST DO THIS WHILE WERE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE TOGETHER AND WE CAN IT CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF BORROWING THIS THIS THIS HOMISH CONCEPT I CALLED RUM SPRING O AND ARUM SPRING IN THE HOMISH WORLD AS WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE SIXTEEN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BE NOT HOMISH FOR TWO YEARS AND THEN WHEN YOU TURNED EIGHTEEN YOU DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU COME BACK TO THE FOLD  AND DURING THIS TWO YEARS KIDS GET DRUNK THEY SLEEP AROUND THEY TRIDRUG SAY TO LOTS AN MEN DELOTS TA STUFF SO WE ARE GING TO HAVE I WE DECIDED TO HAVE A RUMSPRING IM FROM OUR RELATIONSHIP AND THAT'S THE OTHER CRAZY THING IS THAT WE DECIDED THAT IT WOULD THIRTY DAYS WAS ENOUGH CAUSE PROBABLY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS SLEEPING WITH OTHER PEOPLE WLL GET THAT ALL OUT OF OUR SYSTEM AN THIRTY DAYS TURNS OUT IT'S HLKLY DIFFICULT ALL THI SUDDEN BES COME SINGLE AT THIRTY ONE WHEN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SINGLE FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE CAUSE ALLOF T A SUDDEN I 'M IN NEW YORK CITY AND I'M SINGLE AND I'M I SENTIALLY HAVE THE THE THE EMOTIONAL TOOLS OF A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BOY CAUSE THE LAST TIME YOU DATED WAS YOU WERE SEVENTEEN THE LESS IM I DATED I WAS IN A DORM ROOM AND ALSO IT WASN'T THAT I WAS JUST IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS SINGLE IN NEW YORK CITY CAUSE BEING SINGLE IN NEW YORK CITY IS I THINK THE MAJORITY OF IT AS BEING JUST VERY LONELY AND BEING ON YOUR OWN WHEREAS THIS WAS VERY DIFFERENT I WAS IN A MARITH I WAS IN A RACE I WAS IN I WAS IN A THIRTY DAY RACE TO SLEEP WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS I POSSIBLY COULD BECAUSE AFTER THIRTY DAYS I WAS GOING TO GO BACK AND THN'T GET MARRIED   ER ER  SO SO THE'S A TIME CAUGHT TICKING EVERY SINGLE IT WAS ALMOST TO THE MINUTE WRERLGISTY I IF I WAS IN OUT SOMEWHERE TRYING TO MEET SOME ONE I WAS LIKE THIS IS WASTED TIME I AM WASTING MY TIME RIGHT NOW AND ALSO BECAUSE THE FINE CAN WE'RE BOTH MY GIRLFR AND I WERE BOTH VERY COMPETITIVE WITH EACH OTHER THAT WE DIDN'T SPEAK DURING THAT THIRTY DAYS BUT I THINK IN BOTH OF OUR MINDS WE HAD A COMPETITIVE NATURE OF BEING LIKE I NEED TO SLEE WITH MORE PEOPLE THAN SHE DOES AND I THINK SHE FELT THE SAME WAY THAT'S YRUE SHE DID FEEL THAT WAY I ASKED HER SO BEFORE THEY STARTED THE ROOM SPRINGA THEY TOOK U A LAST ROMANTIC TRIPP TOGETHER TO KNEW ORLEANS OF A NEW YEARS AND THEY HAD A GREAT TIME AND THEN ON JANUARY THIRD AFTER THEY BOTH CRIED A BIT KIRT MOVED OUT FOR MONTH SO YOU KNOW SUDDENLY SINGLE THIRTY ONE TIME CAUGHT TICKING WHERE DO YOU START RIGT WITL KIRT CALLED THIS WOMAN THAT HE KNEW JUST A LITTLE BIT AND HAD A DATE ON THE VERY FIRST OR SECOND NIGHT HE CAN'T REMBER WHICH IT WAS AT A DINNER HE TOLD HER THE ENTIRE SITUATION HAT WAY THE HOLDING OUT THAT HE SEEING SOMEBODY THEY WOUR TAKING THIS BREAK TO SLEEP AROUND AND THIS WAS RULE THAT HE MADE FOR HIMSELF THAT HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE HONEST WITH ANY WOMAN THAN HE MET DURING THIS MONTNING WHOM WE HONEST

THIS HAPPENS THIKE I'D NEVER BEAN I'D BEEN AT BARS AN BEFORE IN THE MORNING BUT I WAS ALWAYS IT'S ALVISON LIKE UNCOVERING THIS WHOLE LEVEL OF SINGLE LIFE IN NEW YORK CITY THAT I THAT I WAS JUST HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF BEFORE ANY ONE IN NEW YORK CITY I FEEL LIKE CAN HAVE SEKS ANY NIGHT OF THE WEEK IF THEY JUST FOLLOWED TWO RULES WHICH IS STAY AT THE BARUNTILLFORE IN THE MORNING AND DRAMATICALLY LOWER YOUR STANDARDS T AFTER A MONTH CURT MISSBERFRN GET TOGETHER AND TALK AND THEY AGREED THAT A MONTH WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIUS IT WAS THAT IT WAS JUST OBVIOUS THE EXPERIMENT HADN'T RUN DIS COURSE THEY BOTH WANTED MORE TIME SO THEY DECIDED ON A SECOND MONTH WHICH THEN BECOMES A THIRD MONTH AND FOR CURT IS TIME WHENT ON IT GOT HARDER AND HARDER TO STICK WITH THE RULE THAT THEY HAD MADE OF NOT GETTING INTO ANY RELATIONSHIPS HE JUS MUDDLING ABOUT HAD A FIGURE HAD HOW TO DO THAT AND HIS HEAD E WOULD THINK LIKE WHEN IS SOMETHING ACTUALLY A RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK IN MY HAD ALS LIKE THREE DATES THREE DATES MAKES RELATIONSHIP THAT'S WHAT I DEFINED AND SO THEN I WOULD TRIED AND NOT SEE PEOPLE FMORE THAN THREE TIMES AM THAT WAS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE HE WAS GIVING WOMEN TWO OPPOSITE MESSAGES AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD TELL THEM THAT HE WAS JUST TAKING A MONTH'S BREAK FROM HIS REAL RELATIONSHIP IN THIS ISN'T SERIOUS BUT THEN HE DIDN'T HOLD BACK ANY OF HIS FEELINGS WHAT I I FELT LIKE HEPT HAPPENING WHAS THAT I WOULD ACT LIKE I WANTED TO BE THEIR BOY FRIEND AND THAND AFTER THREE DATES WOULD JUST ABRUPTLY END IT WITH NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER AND AH DAFLIN DEFFLIY PEOPLE WOULD YELL IT ME AND CALL ME NAMES AH AND AND AH AND I AND I FEEL TO THE STAFIAL I FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT THAT I CAUSE I WAS JUST I WAS ACTING LIKE A A CRAZY PERSON AS IKE TAN A PERSON WITH ABSOLUTELY NOBOUNDASSTILL WAS HARD TO STOP HIMSELF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT A CURTS BEST EXPLANATION FOR THAT WAS I ONCE HAD IT WHEN I HAD A DOG I WAS WHEN I WAS A KET I HAT A DOG AND ONE DAY THE CAT NOCKE A FIVE POUND BACKER SUGAR OFF ON O THE FLOOR AND MY DOG WAS ABOUT NINE POUNDS HE WAS A TOY POODAL AND HE ATE ALL OUNDS A SUGAR AND ONE DAY AND AND THET HE WAS SICK FOR LIKE THREE DAYS THATERWARDS BUT I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THAT THAT DAY FOR HIMHOW A AMAZING THAT DAY MUST HAVE BEEND ERE LIKE EATING ALL THAT SUGAR AND EATING  AND THEN CAN LIKE GOING AWAY R I ER LITTLE ON BEING LIKE I CAN'T STAPP WHEN IT'S THIS GAT A HAPPEN AND THEN HE JUST STARTED VOMITING AND VOMITE  THREE STRAIGHT DAYS AND THAT'S HOW I FELT O YOU KNOW  LIKE I KNEW THIS WAS BAD BATOUT I WHEN IS THIS EVER GOEN A HAPPEN AGAD I ESKERS FORFRIEND IF ALL THIS HAPPENE TO HER DURING THE RUMSPRING A TOO IF IT WAS HARD JUST TO HAVE SEX WITHOUT A MOTION ENTERING INTO IT AT ALL AND SHE SAID AB SO LULY NOT QOT YOU MEAN DUDE THAT I ME O BARS OF PARTIES WHATEVER THOSE PEOPLE SHE THAT I DIDN'T TELL ANY ONE ANYTHING BUT MY BACK GROUND OR THE SITUATION AND I ASKED HER WAITS HE WOULDN'T EXPLAIN WHEN OF REAT FROM A RELATIONSHIP SHE SAID NO YECAUSE IT SOUNDS CRAZY IT TOLDHER THAT A KURT WOULD REVEAL ALL OF THAT WHICH SHE KNEW IN SHE'S A DEAR YO CURTS WAY TO OPEN BUT WUOT THIT OPEN IS PROBABLY JUST MADE IM MORE APPEALING TO THE LADYS BUT THE END OF THREE MONTHS CURT SER TO FALL FOR THIS WOMAN THAT HE MET IN AUSTRALIA AND THIS TIME REALLY ACTUALLY FALL FOR HER IN A REAL WAYHT AND THIS  MADE HIM OF COURSE FEEL DIFERENTLY ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS GIRL FRIEND SO IF WE BACK TO THE STATES STATD THEIR OLD APARTMENT AND BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS EVER EXISTED BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE OF COURSE THEY DEALT WITH IT ALL RIGHT AWAY VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND WE WOKE UP IN THE MORNING WE WENT AND GOT BRUNCH AND WE BROUGHT IT TO THE PARK THE WAY WE'D ALWAYS USED TO DO ON SATURDAYS  WE JUST SAT IN THEPARK AND I TALKED AND WE BROKE UP AND TA'S A THING I I CAN'T I CAN'T POINT TO SOMETHING THAT WAS BAD ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP EXCEPT FOR KNOWING THAT I FEEL LIKE IT HAD RUN ITS COURSE MEA WE ORGANICALLY GOT TO THE PAT POINT WHERE WE BOTH THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA THIS THE ROOMSPEIT'S ALMOST LIKE WE WE THE THE THE THE RELATIOIP HAD AN EXPIRATION TABLE WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT AND THEN OFF SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS REALLY COMPLICATED CRAZY PLAN TO  PUT THE TASDOON IT AT THE RIGHT PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BREAK AND IT BROKE   IT'S ALL GIR FRIEND SAND SOMETHING SIMILAR SHE SAID SYHE HAD PROBABLY WANTED OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BEFORE THE ROOM SPRING UP SH SUS TOO SCARED TO ADMITTED TO HERSELF THE ROOMSPRING ED GAVE THEM A WAY TO BREAK UP KURT SAYS HE WOULD NOT WANTED DO A ROOMSPRING U AGAIN BUT HE CAM OUT OFTHIS EXPERIENCE BELIEVING THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO FORCE THINGS TO A DECISION WAS SOME ONE AND THAT IT'S HEALTHY FOR ANY RELATIONSHIP TO BE VALUATED NOW AND THEN I DO HAVE A THEORY NOW I DO HAVE A THEORY ABOUT IF I DO GET MARRIED IN THE FUTURE WHAT I THINK I WOULD WANT TO DO IS HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT AT THE END OF SEVEN YEARS WE HAVE TO GET REMARRIED IN ORDER FOR THE MARRIAGE TOO CONTINUE BUT AT THE END OF SEVEN YEARS IT ENDS AND WE CAN AGREE TO GET REMARRIED OR NOT GET REMARRIED WHY BECAUSE NH'T I GET  THINK YOU GET TO CHOOSE THAT I THINK IT MAKES THE RELATIONSHIP WOULD MAKE THE RELATISHIP STRONGER I DON'T NOWAT I THINK OF THAT CAUSE I THINK ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S A COMFORT IN MARRIAGE IT SHAID THERE ISN'T A DOOR AT SEVEN YEARS AND SO IF SOMETHING IS MEST OP IN THE SHORT TERM THERE'S A COMFORT OF KNOWING LIKE WE WE MADE THIS COMMENTMEN AND SO WHICH SCON WORK THIS OUT AND LIKE AN EVEN IF TO NIGHT WHERE NOT GETTING ALONG OR THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN US DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT YOU HAVE THE COMFORT OF KNOWING LIKE WE'VE GOT TIME OR GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND THAT MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER CAUSE YOU DO GET THROUGH LIKE TIMES WHEN YOU HATE EACH OTHER'S GUTS AND A YOUNG I OF COURSE HE DOR YET AND AND THE NO ESCAP CAUSE WEIRDLY IS A BIGGER COMFORT TO BEING MARRIED THAN I EVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BEFORE I GOT MARRIED REALLY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY YE I LIKE I LIKE THINKING ABOUT IT THAT WAY YO JUST SEE SO MANY EXAMPLES OF WHEN O WERE THAT OF PEOPLE WERE PEOPLE DON'T THINK THAT WAY BU CURTAIN IS GIRL FRIEND TOU LIKE THE ROOMSPRINGE GOT THEM WHERE THEY NEEDED TO GO AS A COUPLE EVEN IF THAT PLACE WAS DIFFERENT THAN THEY INTENDED WHEN THEY BEGAN THE WHOLE THING SOMETIMES WE O NEED TO DO NEXT AS A COUPLE YE CAME AND TELL WHAT IT SHOULD BE BEST YOU CEN DO SOLD YOUR BREATH MAYBE GUESS JUMP WITL THESE DAYS A HER BROWNOLER IS THE HOST OF POD CASCOD BANANAS AND HE VIRTUALLY HOST THELONG RENNING VARIETY SHOW WITH CHRISTIAN SHAWL HOT TUP WITH CROTIN CHRISTEN MONDAYS ON TWIT SO THAT STORYES A FEW YEARS OLD AND I COULD PROBLY SAY A LOT ABOUT THE THINGS THI CURT N I TALK ABOUT AT THE END BUT I WILL LEAVE IT THAT THES THESE DAYS CURTIS MARRIED AND IM NOT A FOR POTES APARANDA ALOSAY IT I BELIEVE THE CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE AND I BELIEVE THAT WORRIES FOR OUR CHILDREN AND THER FUTURE A PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON WORRIES OUT THERE TUMANITYES NIMBLE ONE WORRY CATEGORY TOP OF THE CHARTS OUR SURVEY SAYS CAN'T BE BEAT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION BUT THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER CLASS OF THOUGHTS ABUT HER KID'S FUTURES R LESS ANRTHER NOT WORRY EXACTLY THEY'R MORE JISTLIKE CURIOSITY TEN YEARS AGO WHAT EVE OUR PRODUTERS BACK THEN JOHNTHIN AND HEVAR TALKED ABOUT BOTH THOSE FEELINGS THE CURIOSITY AND THE WORRY ON ISHA POTESWILL HAVE DARK WAVY HAIR HER EYES WILL BE BROWN UNLESS THEY'RE GREEN OR MAYBE HAZEL SHE WILL HAVE FULL LIPS SHE WILL NOT BE TALL WHICH IS THA NICE WAY OF SAYING THAT SHE MIGHT BE SHORT BECAUSE OF THIS FACT POTIS WILL NOT LIKE GOING TO CONCERTS BECAUSE SLIKE MY WIFE HILLORY SHEW'LL ONLY BE OBLE TO SEE THE BACKS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S HEADS AND THAT SPOT ON A PERSONS BACK BETWEEN THEIR SHOULDER BLADES SOME DAY WHEN SHE TOUCHES THAT SPOT IN A PERSON SHE LOVES IT WILL FEEL ODDLY FAMILIAR AND COMFORTING BECAUSE ALL HER LIFE WHILE STANDING IN LINE AT THE SWINGS OR WAITING FOR A CASHIER TO RING UP HER MILK SHE WILL HAVE LOOKED AT THAT SPOT ANOTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE SHE WILL BE OUR DAUGHTER POTIES WILL LIKE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM AND ENJOY PUNDS SHE WILL NEED GLASSES BY THIRD GRADE PODES I SHOULD EXPLAIN IS WHAT HILLERY AND IHAVE TAKEN TO CALLING THE LITTLE GIRL HILORY WILL GIVE BIRTH TO AN TWO THOUSAND TEN CALLING OUR KIT IT ONLY FELT RIGHT FOR ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO SO WE BRAINSTORM BABY CODE NAMES ONE NIGHT IN BED HILLORY THOUGHT THE NAME SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OPENING SCENE IN THE WEST WING PILOT HE ONE WHERE ROB BLOW WALKS OUT OF THE SHOWER AN A WOMAN IN UNDERWEAR IN IMMEN'S DRESS HER WEEDS FROM HIS PAGURE PODES IN A BICYCAL ACCIDENT HILLRY SET OUR COD NAME SHOULD POP LIKE THAT BUT WE COULDN'T THNK OF ANYTHING IS COOLEST POTIS SO WE JUST STOL IT I WORIED THAT WHILE PODIS WAS STILL NOTHING MORE THAN CELLS SPLITTING INTO OTHER CELLES THAT WE MIGHT BE SETTING UNACHIEVABLE EXPECTATIONS BY NAMING HER THE ACRADAN THE SECRET SERVICE USE TO REFER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT YOUR HAVING A BABY THEY PREDICT ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT THE CHILD YOU'LL HAVE BUT I WANTED TO LET POTIS TELL US WHO SHE WAS SO I TRIED TO CLING MOSTLY TO THE FACTS TWENTY WEEKS INTO HILERYS PREGNANCY WE WENT IN FOR AN ULTRASEN OUR ALTERASOUND TACNICIAN LOOK LIKE KATE FROM JOHN AND CAPE PLUS AITE IN SCRUBS SHE HAD THAT CRAZY HAIR DO IND EVERYTHING WE ASKED IF SHE COULD TELL THE GENDER OF THE BABY SHE SAID IT'S A GIRL SHE SAID IT WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM I USE TO TELL HILORY THAT WE GOT A GASBILL IN THE MAIL KNOWING THAT POTES WAS A GIRLMENT THAT NOW THERE WAS A SHAPE TO THE MYSTERY THE ALTRASOUND GAVE US THE LINES OF HE COLORING BOOK AND WE COULDN'T HELP BUT FILL THEM IN HILLERY REMEMBERED ALL THE STUFF ABOUT DOMINANT IN RECESSIVE GENES THAT I SLEPT THROUGH IN MY HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASS AND WE THOUGHT ABOUT OUR FRIEND MA SHELL A BIOLOGIST WHO SPENDS HER DAYS WORKING WITH FRUIT FLAGANES I DO'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS SHE DOES EXACTLY EXCEPT THAT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH DIABETES AND THE SUMMER WHEN I WAS HAVING A FRUIT FLY IN FASTATION SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW I COULD CAPTURE OR KILL THEM I THOUGHT MAYBE MICHEL COULD HELP US FIGURE OUT WHAT POTIS MIGHT LOOK LIKE SHE SAID SHE'D DO HER BEST BUT THAT THIS STUFF WAS MORE COMPLICATED AND HUMANS AN WHAT I WAS IMAGINING SHE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A GREAT PAPER PUBLISHED IN SCIENCE RECENTLY ABOUT THE GENETICS OF DOG COATS AND THAT IF WE WERE BREADING A DOG INSTEAD OF A LITTLE GIRL SHE COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL  SO MICHELL CAME OVER TO OUR HOUSE AND IN EXCHANGE FOR LEZONIA AN A BIERRE SHE SAT WITH ME AND DREW PONNIT SQUARES THOSE LITTLE SQUARES DIVIDED INTO FOUR SMALLER SQUARES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT TRAITS WENT OVER OTHERS MICHEL WAS WILLING TO COMMIT TO A FEW THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT POTIS WILL LIKELY HAVE DARK HAIR BUT REALLY SHE SAID EVEN IF SHE WAS ABLE TO STUDY ME IN HILLERY IN A LAB SHE COULDN'T TELL US WITH ANY CERTAINTY WOUTD OUR BABY WILL LOOK BECAUSE UNLIKE DOGS HUMANS HAVIN'T BEEN BREAD FOR CERTAIN TRAIT SO THERE'S REALLY NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT GREEN EYES MAY BE HIDING IN MY GENES MOSTLY SHE SAID THE WHOLE DOMINANT RECESSIVE THING COULD HELP LUS FIGURE OUT DOPY STUFF LIKE FOR INSTANCE NOW WE KNOW THAT POTES WILL HAVE UNATTACHED EARLODS AND BE ABLE TO IMPRESS HER FRIENDS WITH HER ABILITY TO ROLL HER TONGUE LIKE A TA A FEW MONTHS AGO NOT LONG AFTER WE FOUND OUT THAT POTIS WAS A GIRL I WAS WRITING MY BIKE HOME FROM WORK THE TRAFFIC WAS HEAVY SO I WAS GOING PRETTY SLOW I LOOKED TO MY RIGHT AND NOTICED A GURL ON THE SIDEWALK LOOKING AT ME STARING REALLY SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS IN HER EARLY TWENTIES AND SHE HAD HER AUBURN HAIR TIDING A THICK BRAY THAT SWUNG OVER HER RIGHT SHOULDER I CAN'T REMEMBER IF SHE WAS WEARING GLASSES BUT I KNOW SHE WAS WEARING A DRESS AND HOLDING A PETITION CLIPBOARD IN HER RIGHT HAND IF SKIN WAS MADE OF PLATO HERS IS WHAT YOU WOULD GET IF YHE FOREVER MIXED THE HILLORY COLOR WITH THE JONATHAN ONE I COULDN'T TELL YOU IF IT WAS THAT OR THE WAY SHE LOOKED AT ME IN TENTLY THAT'S TO BLAME BUT I STARED BACK THE FIRST SPLIT SECOND I THOUGHTION MIGHT BE POTIS ALL

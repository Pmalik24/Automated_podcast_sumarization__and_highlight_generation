HAPEN O THEY WERE GIN FRIENDS ER SIR I I NOW JEFF TURNS OUT THAT IS NOT THE REAL COINCIDENCE OF THE STORY MY PRODUCER BRYAN READ WAS LISTENING TO ALL THESE INTERVIEWS AS THEY WERE HAPPENING AND HE INTERRUPTED US TO TELL US WE BOTH MISSD THE POINT BRIN IS TO SPLAIN OUT THAT I MIS YOU AND I ERE BOTH MISTIN AN IN O  COINCIDENCE OF MY OWN STORY I SUMITTED AT O THE COINCIDENCETHES THING SO THE MAIN COINCIDENCS THERE'S A GIRL MISSING AT THE SAME TIME YET I HAVE FIVE WORDS FOR YOU JEFF BOO SHALL WU TONTHAL NO COINCIDENCE NO STORY HERE IS A DEFINITION OF COINCIDENCE THAT SEEMS RIGHT TO ME A COINCIDENC IS A SURPRISING CONCURRENCE OF EVENTS PERCEIVED AS MEANINGFULLY RELATED WITH NO APPARENT CAUSAL CONNECTION IT'S THAT MIDDLE PART MEANINGFULLY RELATED THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO GET STUCK ON BECAUSE WHEN EVENTS LINE UP JUST SO YOU CAN'T HELP IT YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF THERE'S A MESSAGE IN THAT IN THAT WAY COINCIDENCES ARE KIND OF LIKE SHORT CUTS TO VERY BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT FATE ABOUT GOD EVEN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN EITHER ONE THE NOTION THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE SOME ONE OR SOME THING IS PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR LIFE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A PLAN CONJURED THROUGH COINCIDENCES THAT NOTION SEEMS TO BE MOST APPEALING WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG WE GOT ONE STORY ABOUT A YOUNG COUPLE VISITING MARICASH IN MOROCCO THEREAT A RESTAURANT TALKING LIKE YOU DO ABOUT OLD FLAMES THE BOYFERIN

UT I ON TA BLYER  ABOUT A WE AND A AN AND THEN THAT VERY PAUSE THAT BRINGS US STRACT FIVE WHAT ARE THE CHANCES IN ORDER TO LET A GOOD COINCIDENCE LIVE A LONG AND HEALTHY LIFE TO GET TOLD AND RETOLD AND TAKE ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE NARRATIVE OF YOUR LIFE  SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO STOP YOURSELF FROM THINKING IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH WHY IT HAPPENED REALLY IS THE FACT IS ANY STATISTITION WILL PROBABLY RAIN ON YOUR PARADE WELL TELL YOU THESE THINGS HAPPEND A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN YOU THINK BUT A GOOD COINCIDENCE IS LIKE A GOOD MAGIC TRICK WHEN YOU SEE ONE A STRUGGLE AND SIS INSTANTANEOUSLY BUT TWEEN THE THRILL OF THE APPARENT MIRACLE AND THE URGED TO DOBUNKIT THIS FINAL STORY IS BY CARRY WEEKS HE'S A PROP GUY FOR THE MOVIES BUT HE TOLD THIS AT A STORY TELLING COMPETITION SO HERE'S MY STORY NINE YEARS OLD FIRST TI'ME GOING TO SUMMER CAMP AND MY GRANDFATHER GIVES ME BEFORE I GO HE GIVES ME HIS OLD POCKE KNIFE IS PRESSICLY IN ANTIQUE AND SO THE FIRST THING ALL IS BOYS DO WHEN WE GET TO CAMP IS WE PULL IT OUR KNIFES WHO START THROW THEM AT THINGS  TRYING TO GET THEM TO STICK THE WAY DAN OR BONE DID AND BECAUSE HIS NINETEEN SOUND ES THERE'S NOTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT A BUNCH OF YOUNG CHILDREN THROWING SHARP KNIVES AROUNDI GOT MINED TO STICK IN THE FLOOR BOARD ILS I LONG AND IS GRIFE THAT WHEN I PULLD IT OUT THE TIP BROKE OFF O BUT ANYWAY CAN'T GOES ON IND A FEW DAYS LATER I NOTICE MY KNIFE IS MISSING AND I'LL LOOK EVERYWHERE FOR IT I LOOK HILOOK LOW IT'S GONE THE ONE DAY AND WALKIN THROUGH CAMP AND SEE THIS GROUP OF BOYS THROWN KNIFE AT A TREE AND SOMETHIN TELLS ME I SHOULD CHECK THIS OUT AND SURE ENOUGH THERE'S HIS BOY THERE THROWIN MY KNIFE NOW THERE'S NO MISTAKING THIS KNIFE BECAUSE THE HANDLE WAS RED AND GREEN BUT THE COLLER'S MET IN THE MIDAL N COUNT SWOLL TOGETHER IN THE TRIPPY PSYCODELIC WAY AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A KNIFE LIKE THAT BEFORE SINCE SO WALK UP TO THIS BOY HOU'S LOITOTLE OLD OR BE WALK UP TO HIM AS SAY HEY THAT'S MY KNIFE HE SAYS NOW IT'S MIFE ASS A NO THAT'S MY KNIFE MY GRANDFATHER GAVE IT TO ME HE SAYS NO HE DIDN'T IS IS MY GRANDFATHER GAVE IT TO ME AND I'M CONFUSED ALL THE SUN MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHTHERS THROUGH BET MORE I THOUGHT HE WOULD JUST HAND IT OVER AND THE OTHER BOYS THE LIKE MOVIN CLOSE AND UN THINKIN COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT HIS GRANDFATHER GAVE HIM THE EXACT SAME KNIFE THAT MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ME I MEAN IS THIS A THING AND I JUST DID' KNOW IT BUT I'L LOOK AT THE KNIFE HE'S HOLDING HIS HAND AND I LOOK AT THE BLADE AND SEE THAT THE TIP OF THE BLADE IS SQUARE IT OFF IS THOUGH IT WERE BROKEN AND I SAY THAT'S MY KNIFE BECAUSE I BROKE THE TIP OFF WHEN I STUCK IT IN THE FLOOR HE SAYS WHAT THAT NO IT CAME THAT WAY SO HE CAN IS IT LIKE A SCREW DRIVER AND I LOOK AT THE OTHER BOYS AND I'M NOT GETTING ANY HELP FROM THEM AND SO I WANDER OFF JUST THINKING TO MYSELF SCREW DRIVER AND NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT WELL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS REALLY BUG ME AND I DON'T MEAN JUST WHILE I WAS AT CAMP BUT LIKE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND YOU KNOW I CANT THINK WHY DID I FOLD SO EASILY WHY DIDN'T I GO TO THE COUNSILLORS AND THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS THIS I'M THE SUN OF A PHYSICIST AND I USED TO ASK MY DAD THESE QUESTIONS ALL THE TIME LIKE DAD HOW FAR AWAY IS THE SUN DAD HOW FAST IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT DAD WHAT'S THE CLOSEST STAR AND HE WOULD GIVE ME THESE ANSWERS IN THESE NUMBERS THAT WOULD JUST SO ING HUGE I COULDN'T GET MY MIND AROUND THEM SO MY MY POINT IS THIS I BETTER THAN MOST OTHER CHILDREN HAD AN IDEA OF JUST HOW BAST THE UNIVERSE IS AND THERE POR HOW INFINITE THE POSSIBILITIES ARE SO MY THE THING IS AT THE TIME MY THT WOT MAY BE THE KITS TELLING THE TRUTH SO THE ONLY RIES WHEN I BRING TIS UP IS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING OF WHEN SOME THIRTY TWO YEARS LATER I BECOME THE LANDLORD OF A SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID AS A LANDLORD WAS I I THREW THE SKY OUT BECAUSE HE WAS A SMALL TIME DRUG DEALER SO ON THE DAY HE'S MOVING OUT I GET A CALL FROM HIS NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE HALL A GI I CALL BUDWISER BOB AND BUDWISER BOB IYS A THAT DRUGGY IS STEALING YOUR REFRIGERATOR  AND SO I HOP DOWN THERE AND SURE ENOUGH IN THE DRIVEWAY IS A PICK UP TROK AND IN THE BACK OF THE PICK UP TRUCK IS A REFRIGERATOR SO I CHARGE UP THE STAIRS AND A DEMAND TO KNOW JUST WHAT THE HELSE GOING ON AND NECK THE DRUGGY CALMLY TELLS ME IS SAYS DOD WHEN I MOVED IN HERE THAT REFRIGERATOR WAS SO GROSE I BOUGHT MY OWN REFRIGRATOR AND SWAPPED IT OUT AND I PUT THAT WHEN HOU STORGE AND NOW ON JUST PUT IN AT BACK AND I LOOK IN THE KITCHEN AND SURE NOT THERE'S ANOTHER REFRIGERATOR IT'S A LITTLE OLD A LITTLE DIRTY BUT IT'S WORKING AND I'M TRYING TO THINK THI THREUG I MEAN WOULD SOMEONE REALLY GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE OF JUST SWAPPING OUT OR FRIGERATOR IN THEM PUTTING IN STORAGE AND BRINGING IT BACK OR WOULD AT GI GO TO THE TROUBLE STEALING A USED REFRIGERAT OR JUST AS CREW AS LANDLORD AND REPLACING IT WITH AND EVEN MORE USED TO REFRAGERAAND WELL THE ANSWER TO BOTH THESE QUESTIONS IS YATS BUT I LOOK O AND THERE'S NECK AND HE'S EXPECTING ME TO SAY SOMETHING AND THERE'S IS BUDIES OR HELPING HIM MOVE AND THEY'RE EXPECTING ME TO SAY SOMETHING SO I WALK UP TO NECK I LOOK HIM IN THE EYE AND I SAY TO HIM YOU SWEEP UP REAL GOOD BEFORE YOU LEAVE CARES THERE'S JUST TWO MANY POSSIBILITIES IN THIS UNIVERSE CARRY ME EXCLANIN NEW YORK HIS STORY WAS RECORDED LIVE AT A MOT STORY LAMMING YOR CITY YOU CAN

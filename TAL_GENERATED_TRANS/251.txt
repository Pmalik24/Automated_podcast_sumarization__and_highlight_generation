OUR SHOW FOR THANKSGIVING WE CAN WE BUT TOGETHER A SHOW MADE OF STORIES WE'VE DONE OVER THE YEARS ABOUT FOO IND EVERY ONE OF THESE STORIES SOMEBODY HEADS OUT ON A QUEST EITHET FIGURE SOMETHING OUT ULD IT DO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENTLY WITH FOOD THAT MOST OF US TO DRY BEASY CHICAGO ITS THIS AMERICAN LIFE AM OUR GLASS THEY WITH US THAT ONE DEAD RING ER IT'S AVER YEARS BACK ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS BENT CALHOON SET OUT ON A MISSION MUCH MORE ECCENTRIC AND LABOR INTENSIVE THE FINGURING OUT IF A CHICKEN IS DONE BY LISTENING TO THE SOUND HERE HE IS I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IN AN EMAIL IT CAME FROM A LISTENER A WOMAN NAME EMILY RANCER PEWORKS IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY AND THE LETTER EMILY WROTE WAS ABOUT A STORY SHE'D HEARD FROM A FARMER THE FARMER WHO TOLD HER THIS IS APPARENTLY A PERSON OF SOME STANDING IN THE PORK INDUSTRY ADMITTEDLY I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT THE PORK INDUSTRY BUT HE'S IN CHARGE OF A PORK PRODUCING OPERATION THAT SPAN SEVERAL STATES THE STORY HE TOLD EMILY WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS A WHILE AGO HE WAS VISITING A PORK PROCESSING PLANT NOCLEHOMA HE'S WALKING THROUGH IT WITH A FRIEND A GUY WHO MANAGED THE PLANACTUALLY AND AT SOME POINT HE SAW BOXES STACKED ON THE FLOOR LABELED ARTIFICIAL CALAMARI HE STOOD THERE WONDERING FOR A SECOND AND THEN HE ASKED HIS FRIEN WHAT'S ARTIFICIAL CALAMARI BUNG HIS FRIEND REPLIED IT'S HOG RECKDIM RECKDIM THAT WOULD BE SLICED INTO RINGS DEEP FRIED AND BOOM THERE HE HAVE IT HOKE IF I CAN LET ME JUST NARRATE FOR YOU WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN IT WOULD MEAN THAT IN RESTAURANTS EVERYWHERE WRITE THIS SECOND PEOPLE OUR SQUEEZING LEMON WEDGES OVER CHRISPY GOLDEN RINGS ND DIPPING THE RINGS INTO MARINARA SAWT AND THEY'RE EATING OG RECKDIM NOW THEY'RE TEWING SATISFYED AND DEEPLY CLULESS IT'S PAY BACK IT'S PAY BACK FOR U BLISSFUL IGNORANCE ABOUT WHERE OUR FOOD  COMES FROM AND HOW IT GETS TO US IT'S AMAZING AND IT'S BUT IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE A COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE SO I CALLED UP THE FARMER THE TALK TO HIM PERSONALLY I WANTED TO HEAR AT FIRST HAND AND THE FARMER CONFIRMD THE STORY BE ENTIRE THING THE BOXES THE BUNG BUT WHEN I ASKED HIM TO GO ON THE RECORD TO TAPE AN INTERVIEW AND GIVE HIS NAME HERE ON THE RADIO HE VERY POLITELY DECLINED WHICH SEEMS SUSPICIOUS RIGHT WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY HE SAID HE'D SPOKEN WITH HIS GIRL FRIEND ABOUT IT AND SHE SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE WORDS THAT HE WANTED TO COME UP WHEN SOMEBODY GOOGLED HIS NAM THIS WAS ALL FINE THOUGH BECAUSE HE REFERRED ME TO THE REAL EXPERT THE GUY WHO GAVE HIM THE TOUR OF THE HOG PROCESSING PLAN AND THAT GUY HE AGREED TO TALK  OH Y IS THIS RAN YE YE THIS IS RN ME MEET PROCESSING PLANT MANAGER PRESENTLY RESIDING IN MOUNTAIN VIEW MISSERY WHERE HE RUNS AN ORGANIC BEEF PROCESSING PLANT THERE CALLED BEYOND ORGANIC IF THE STORY REALLY WERE TRUE RAN WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GUY WHO EXPLAINED TO THE FARMER WHAT WAS IN THOSE BOXES THE BOT O ER CAN BABOT  AND AND THEYRE ALA BAT GAT O EMAT YOE LOT MAY BE YE A BIN A WAIBI  PEO E T BU AN TA YOU OT IT WHAT BOT YE BAT BOT A AT E THA AN AN IN WA AN ER TAN TA WA OT ABOT A BIG MADLE WITHAT BA BA A B BUT BUT THE SPECIFICALLY THE LABELS THAT SAID A IMITATION CALUMARI BUT WHERE WHERE DID YOU PERSONALLY SEE THE IMITA HO HOWMAR THEY LA A A EVER TI TAT WABLE BAY THAT TA BALA PO ATHE THE PEOPLE TA PO MEA E THE PEOPLE A WORT ORAT E PMEER OH THE PEOPLE THAT THAT YOU WORK FOR TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS USED FOR IMITATION CALUMRI BT AND IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT YOU THINK THAT THA WHEN THEY WERE EXPLAINING THIS TO YOU THAT THAT THEY WERE ON O HAVIN YOU ON A LITTLE BIT HAVEN ME O YE LIKE A O MAHEHE YE A WELL I WHAT BA THAT BUT  O BE PAPERFI UBEN TAT Y BO PEERFOY BARED OOKE JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BETTER PICTURE A PORT BUNG AND BUNG IS THE ACTUAL INDUSTRY TERM FOR IT IS LONG AND FLOPPY AND UGLY AT ONE END IT WIDENS OUT INTO THIS MORE BULBISH SHAPE LIKE A PINK WRINKLY PAIR THAT'S THE RECTOM AT THE OTHER END AT NARROWS INTO A SOFT PINKISH WHITE TOO I KNOW IT SOUNDS GROWS BUT ALSO CONSIDER WE ARE A NATION THAT YOUTS MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS OF SAUSAGE EVERY YEAR BILLIAN WITH A BEE MAYBE YOU LIKE LIVER WORST TOR CAPICOLA OR SUMMER SAUSAGE WITH A NATURAL CASING THEN YOU LIKE ME HAVE EATEN BUNG STUFF DRIED BUNG A LOT OF BROTS AND ITALIAN SAUSAGES ARE STEFFED IN IN TESTING SO IF YOU EAT THOSE REGULARLY YOU PRETTY MUCH LIVE UP THE STREET FROM BUNG SO WHY DOES THE IDEA OF A FRIED RING OF BUNG JUST FEEL GROSER PARTLY IT'S THE VISUAL RIGHT WHEN YOU SEE THAT LITTLE RING OF CALUMARI YOU DON'T WANT A PICTURE IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A PICKS BEHIND THEN THERE ARE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T EAT PORK PERIOD ROWN SAID THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER REASON TAT BEGA T A BU BOR BUNG BROBABLY AND PEOPLE BOUT YE WA GA U BU MAAMA AT HE BUNG THAT Y A YO AWAY E BUT THE BIG QUESTION THE QUESTION YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SINCE WE GOT ON THIS TOPIC HAVE YOU OR I EATEN IMITATION CALUMARI BUNG DRESSED UP IS SA FOOD WELL BRON DIDN'T KNOW HE SAID HIS PLAN EXPORTED A LOT OF THEIR BNG TO ASIA BUT HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHATEVER HAPPENED AFTER LEFT THE DOOR SO HE COULD ONLY SPECULATE ANYTHING HE SAID WOULD BE A WILD GUESS THE WHOLE SO I TURND TO PEOPLE WHO WOULD KNOW IS PORK BUNG BEING FALSELY PETALED AS COLUMARI I CALLED TO YOUASTIE THE YOU ESTE IS FOOD INSPECTION SERVICE ISSUED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT TO ME PRODUCTS WE INSPECT INCLUDING THOSE DERIVED FROM PORK MUST BE ACCURATELY LABELED AND CANNOT PURPORT TO BE A PRODUCT OF ANOTHER SPECIES SO IT'S TA GAINST THE RULES BUT PEOPLE BREAK THE RULES A RECENT STUDY OF SEA FOOD BY A GROUP CALLED OCEANA USED D AN ATESTING AND FOUND THAT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY FISH IS REGULARLY BEING LABELED AS OTHER SPECIES RESTAURANTS AND ENGROSE RESTORES ESCALAR SOLD IS WHITE TUNA POSI ROCKFISH BEING FRAUDULENTLY SOLD TAS SNAPPER IN MY AMI MORE THAN THIRTY PER CENT OF FISH WAS BEING SOLD AS SOMETHING IT WASN'T AND NEW YORK THE NUMBER WAS THIRTY NINE PER CENT BOSTON FORTY EIGHT PER CENT WOS ANGELIS AR YOUREADY FIFTY FIVE PER CENT FIFTY FI THAT MEANS IF YOU ORDER FISHIN ALAY YOU ARE MOST LIKELY EATING A SPECIES YOU DID NOT ORDER IN OTHER WORDS SEEFOOD SUBSTITUTION IS RAMPEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE WHAN I CAN TELL YOU CAN GET CLEANED HOG BUNG FOR ABOUT HALF THE PRICE OF CLEAN SQUID SO THERE WOULD BE MONEY AT IT IF YOU COULD PULL OFF THE SUIT AS BEST AS I CAN TELL WERE YOU TO DO THIS YOU WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT A LAWYER WHOSE FAMILIAR WITH THIS AREAOF LAW AN REGULATION TOLD ME ONCE BUNG LEAVES THE PLANT THERE'S A VARIETY OF AGENCIES AND ENITIES THAT WOULD BE IN PLAY U STIE F TIE STAED AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT ULTIMATELY HE SAID THE REGULATION WE HAVE IS NOT DESIGNED TO CATCH IN O FENCE LIKE THIS IT'S AIM MOSTLY AT SANITATION AND FOOD SAFETY SO BOTTOM LINE THE LAWYER SAID IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO DO IT CHANCES ARE THEY'D GET AWAY WITH IT SO IS SOME ONE OUT THERE DOING THIS WELL FOR WEEKS I LOOKD FOR AN ANSWER THE UESTIA SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANY ONE TRYING TO PASS PORK BUNG AS SQUID OR ANY OTHER SPECIES I CONTACTED THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION THE NATIONAL PORK PRODUCERS COUNSIL THE NATIONAL PORK BOARD A SQUID FISHERMAN'S ASSOCIATION  CISCO AND THEOTHER BIG FOOD IN RESTAURANT SUPPLY COMPANIES IT HOG WHAT A BUNG BUT HOG RECTAM OHLI GAT THAT'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WETFISH PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION BUT THE ANSWER WAS PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS THE SAME NOBODY HAD HEARD OF IT BUT ALMOST TO A PERSON THEY ADDED THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT HAPPENING SOMEWHERE RON MEEKS SET A LOT OF THE BUNG FROM HIS PLANT GOT EXPORTED SO MY NEXT CALLED WAS TO THE UES MEAT EXPORT FEDERATION WHICH CONFIRMD THAT QUOTE THE MAIN DESTINATIONS FOR PORK BUNGS ARE CHINA HONG KONG JAPAN TIWAN CAREA AND THE PHILIPPINES THEY ARE MAINLY USED FOR PROCESSING BUT WE ARE AWARE OF SOME USES IN SOUPS AND CERTAIN ENTRAS WE ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM BEING USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR CALAMARI BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE ON QUOTE SO OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS I'VE CALLED ASGEN FOOD SUPPLIERS PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN WORK IN AND EAT IN THOSE COUNTRIES I TALKED TO A WOMAN NAMED CAREING TRANG WHOSE WRITTEN IN OVERARCHING COMPENDIUM OF ASNT QUAZINES I'VE TALKE TO ACADEMICS AT ANOY OU AND HAVE AFFERRED AND U C AND HARVARD I'VE REACHEDUF TO CHEFTS WHO KNOW ASENT FOOD THE ANSWER AGAIN ALWAYS SIMILAR NEVER HEARD OF IT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE PARTLY BECAUSE BUNG DOESN'T HAVE SUCH A COMPLICATED REPUTATION IN ATIA HERE IT HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF SECRET INGREDIENT LIKE A DOES HERE ON THE OTHER HAND THOUGH PEOPLE POINTED OUT THAT IN CAREA IN JAPAN YOU CAN'T GET MORE THAN A FEW HOURS FROM THE OCEON SQUIT IS CHEAP AND IT'S READILY AVAILABLE YOU'D ONLY EAT A SUBSTITUTE IF YOU WANTED THE SUBSTITUTE GENERALLY PEOPLE SAID IF THE SWITCH WAS HAPPENING SOMEWHERE THEY'D GUESS CHINA EVENTUALLY I FOUND MY WAY TO THIS SGUY WHO I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SOME ONE WHO I THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE MY ANSWER HE WAS GET THIS AN ANTHROPOLOGIS WHO LIVED AND WORKED IN CHINA FOR FORTY YEARS WERE HE STUDIED FOOD AND SPECIFICALLY MEAT WHEN I TALKED TO HIM THOUGH HE MADE TWO POINTS POINT ONE MY QUESTION ABOUT THIS HAPPENING IN ASIA WAS RACIST EVEN JUST ASKING THE QUESTION WAS RASIS TBECAUSE IT PLAYS ON IGNORANT STEREO TYPES ABOUT OTHER CULTURES EATING THINGS THAT WE PERCEIVE HIS WEIRD POINT TOO WAS THAT RON MEEK MY GOT FROM THE PIG PLANT ROUN WAS PULLING MY LEG AND HE WAS GETTING AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE I WAS A DUMASS HE TOLD ME MORE THAN ONCE THAT I SHOULD QUOTE FIND SOMETHING WORTH WHILE TO DO WITH MYSELF WHEN WE ENDED OUR CONVERSATION HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS REFUSING TO EVEN DIGNIFY WHAT I WAS DOING BY APPEERING ON THE RADIO OR BY LETTING ME USE HIS NAME OOKI SO TO RESPOND TO HIS POINTS ONE BY ONE FIRST AND MY RASIST AGAINST AGENS WELL I'M HALF CHINESE MY MOM'S CHINESE LIKE ANY ONE I'VE HAD THE OCCASIONAL ISSUE WITH MY MOTHER BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN ONE OF THEM WE GREW UP IATING CHICKEN FEET AND FISH EYES AND I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHO EATS WHAT WITHOUT BEING RACIST HIS SECOND POINT THOUGH THAT RON MEEK WAS PULLING MY LEG I MEAN THE GUY WAS STILL AN EXPERT ON MEET IN CHINA SO I CALLED RAN BACK A THIK ME COM QUISE ON DID I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE ANTHROPOLOGIST ABOUT WHAT HE SAID I GUESS I MEAN THE ONLY THING I WOULD ASK YOU IS IS AR  AR YOUE MESSIN WITH ME NOW I MEAN THAT WIT WAT MA BO TO ME O WHA WHAT THE HAIL WE FAY HAT BE HOB UN FOR YE THEN THAT O E BRAMI PASION WET TET LIKE THAT BUT SO IN YOUR IN YOUR HARDE HEARTS YOU BELIEVE IT Y MAN I MEAN I MAY I GET A THAT REN TERY THNG IT IT IS BOT BAY WITH YOU AN WHEN THAT I YO GO ON OFF ABAT TLEG YOU HAGIN O BA I MEAN YOA THANK ABOUT AT HOW FOR IT TANT TOTER HALF IS AR TECIALLY TIG ONE THAT N A MAK EVER PANY CA WA THE ONE I WORK THAT YOU BRING THE PIG THAN YOU TA AN HOU TICK AM AND THE BLOOD GO OF AND TO THE TROP AND A GON TOWN IN IT BACK YOU THA DOW THERE WITH THAT A TAK YOU AND TE THANK R FUD YOU AND I THAT BRIT THE BLOOD FROM THE BLOOD BLATMA AND I THAG THAT I MAN T THAT THE WON THEY TA THE PANKRY IF THEY THAY THE BLAN THE BAY THE HARD NO ONLY THANG AWAT BY THE TAM E TO THAT TAN IN THE GOW AND YO B I MAN YOU CAN BE AN AT THE BO IF TOU YOU A IT YOU DO WHORK IN A BO ITING BUIET YOU DON'T MOT I CONTACT OF THE PLANT ROUND WORKED AT WHERE THIS HAPPEN AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH THEY BACKED IM UP THEY SAID THER SALES TEAM HAD HEARD OF PEOPLE EATING PORK BUNG HIS IMITATION CALUMARI THOUGH THEY HADN'T WITNESS AT FIRS HAND OR HEARD IT DIRECTLY FROM A CUSTOMER IT WAS ALL HERE SAY SO AT THE END OF ALL THIS I STILL HAD NO PROOF THAT ANY ONE WAS PASSING OFF BUNG IS SQUID AND I REALIZED I HADN'T ASKED THE MORE BASIC QUESTION HERE COULD BUNG DO IT COULD I PASS HIS CALUMARY AND THAT QUESTION LED ME TO A GINAME EDDY LIN AND HE LAND HAS EATEN A LOT OF BUNG AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES HE SAID PROBABLY MORE AND HE HAS A EXTREME FOOD BLUG CALLED DEEP BEND DINING AND AN ONLINE TEVISHO CALLED COMICASI KITCHEN I COULD DOUTILY FEET YOU RESEMBLANCE TEXTURE WOD OH REALLY YET YE DUFNLY OM BULD BIT A TORT OF THIS WHART OF A RUBBERY TEXTURE SORT OF LIKE A COLUMARY  BUT YOU WOULD REALLY HAVE TOU GET RID OF THAT N  YOU YO WU THE THIG TOW FLEVEN ODER FRUM THE T BEO THE BUN SOMEHOW I HADN'T FIGURE THAT THE BUNG ONCE IT WAS SCRUBBED AND RINTE AND CLAIME WITH STEEM THAT IT WOULD STILL TASTE LIKE YOU KNOW UM O YOU AR YOU UL DUT WE HAVE TO YOU A MAD YOUR MADOR BANCHING A HA  WINY HA MA MA AT BINI YE HA A TIS IS I TRYING TO REACH THAT THOSE FLAVORS AUTER THERE YA IME TAT TO WAVER A BEN YA MARNIDN  TAT HAD FOR O QUITE A WHILE O A LIFETIME YO AHA HA  HE THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE EASY BUT HE THOUGHT IT COULD BE DONE AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO TELL IF HE WAS RIGHT TOOK COOK UP SOME BUNG AND EAT IT AND IF THE TASTE WAS OVERWHELMING AND THE TEXTURE WAS ALL WRONG WILL THEN I'D HAVE MY ANSWER AND AT THIS POINT I'LL BE FRANK I STARTED TO ROUTE FOR THE BUNG I REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A STORY ABOUT FRAUD IT'S NOT A BAIT AN SWITCH STORY IT'S A STORY ABOUT POSSIBILITY IT'S CLASSIC RAGS TO RICHES IT'S ABOUT WHETHER A CUT OF MEAT PERHAPS THE LOWLIEST MOST MOLIONABLE CUT OF MEAT IN AMERICA MIGHT SOMEHOW AND AT LEAST ONE PLACE ON THE PLANET BE DIPPED IN THE REDEMPTIVE OILS OF THE GREAT CULINARY EQUALIZER THAT IS THE DEEP FRIAR AND IT MIGHT EMERGE TRANSFORMED NO LONGER AN OUTCAST BUT INSTEAD HAIR COMED CLEAN SHAVEN AND A SUITEN TIE IT MIGHT WALK REBORN ON TO A TABLE THROUGH SHEER FORCE OF RESEMBLANCE IT MIGHT BE LOVE IT'S HISTORY YEARS OF DRUDGERY AND HARDSHIP DOING THE BODI'S LEAST GLAMOROUS JOB ALL WASHED AWAGH NO THIS IS NOT THE STORY OF A CONMAN LIKE BURNEY MADE OFF IT'S PRETTY WOMAN THIS IS WHETHER GOODWILL HUNTING FINDS HIS WAY OUT OF SOUTH IT'S WHETHER CHARLEY ON THAT VERY LAST CHOCOLATE BAR REALLY CAN GET A GOLDEN TICKET   TO DO ALL THIS TO TRY IT I CALLED MY LITTLE SISTER LOREN SHE'S A SHAFT TRAINED ABROAD AT THE CORDONBLEEAU WORKED AT MISCHALN STARR RESTAURANTS SHE'S AT KANNISHAFFT SOON WE WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF A DELLY CASE AND I DO'T KNOW WHY I FEEL HESITAN ABOUT SAYING THIS BECAUSE I DON'T

STUBBORN FLAVOR COO THAT FLAVOR SHE SAID IT'S TOUGH TO GET RID OF THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN AND BUNG WILL ALWAYS TASTES LIKE BUT THERE WAS NO BACKING OUT NOW WE WOULD EAT WE WOULD EAT OUR WAY TO THE TRUTH AND SO WHAT IF IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD  SO WAT OF BUNG WAS DESTINED TO TASTE LIKE BUNG YOU KNOW WHO I DIDN'T LOOK GOOD FOR AND HE STILL PUT OT EFIGHT ROCKY BALBOLA THAT TO THIS WAS IT THE BUNG VERSEIS CALUMARI SQUIDVERSE IS TAL THE RUMBLE IN THE BUNKLE WE SET UP THE TASTING AT A RESTAURANT IN A LOVE BETWEEN LUNCHEON DINNER IN THE DINING ROOM THERE WAS JUST A FEW TABLES EATING AND ALL ROUND THE RESTAUROUNT THE MORNING SHIP WAS WRAPPING UP AS WE WALKED IN WITH A RED COOLER FILLED WITH SQUID AND HOGBUNG SO ORIGINALLY I'D RECRUITED SOME HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE FROM OUR OFFICE AT THIS AMERICAN LIFE AS TASTERS THE FINAL GROUPE THE DAY OF THE TASTING INCLUDED FROM THE OFFICE SATHLIND AND BRYAN REED SO SO WINDLESS ON THAT YOU GETS HAD CALIMARI UM I HAD CALUMARI PROBABLY LIKE A MONTH

HE'D BEEN LIVING IN FEAR AT IF YOU FIND OUT THAT THERE IN DISCERNIBLE FROM EACH OTHER L U EVERY CALIMARI GA NO I DON'T THINK SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO DO THIS JUST TO NO GOING FORWARD BACK IN THE KITCHEN THINGS WERE LOOKING BAD I GIVEN UP ON THE IDEA THAT DRUNG WOULD TASTE THE SAME AS CALUMARI NOW IT HUNG MY HOS ON THE IDEA THAT IT LEAST VISUALLY IT WOULD LOOK THE SAME BUT IS MY SISTER DROPPED THE FLOWERED RINGS OF HOGBUNG INTO THE FRIRE THEY HAD TURNED INTO THIS KINO BIG UGLY TANGLED BOD NOTHING LIKE THE JIGGLY SQUIT RINGS OH THE VERE TE VERY LIKE SCRAGGLY LOOKING BUT THEN AS IF BY A MIRACLE THEY CHANGED MY SISTER GAVE A SHAKE TO THE FRY BASKET AND AS THEY SIZZLED THE BUNCHES SEEMED TO GRACEFULLY SNAP INTO RINGS OH LOOK AT THAT THO IT'S LIKE MAGIC TER LIKE TURNING INTO CIRCLE A O O  SOON WE WERE FACE TO FACE WITH THE PLATE ON IT THEY WERE TWO PILES OF RINGS SIMILAR IN SIZE SIMILAR IN SHAPE THE BUNG HAD MORE OF A FRIZZLY EDGE TO IT KIND OF LIKE A FANCY ONION RING THE CALUMARI WAS SMOOTHER GATESO I AS SATHAN BRYAN DID JUST GIVE A FIRST IMPRESSION  HAVE IT GUESS BUT I COULD TOITS MOST TING  YOU PRETTY SURE BUT YOU COULD TOULD BE WRONG G I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE SURE I DON'T I'M AWFA NOW MY GOT REACTION MY IREACTION IS THAT THIS WAS THIS WAS CALUMARI THIS WAS NOT BOOKET BEFORE YOU READ IT YOU SEE I TOLALLY THIKE THIS WAS CALUMARI THE OTHER ONE SAWMON A DO A AT THE SAME TIME FOOKET SO JUST TO BE CLEAR WHAT'S GOING ON HERE SATH HAS CHOSEN ONE PILE OF RING WHICH HE THINKS IS CALUMAR BRYAN HAS DONE THE SAME THING ONLY BRYAN IS CHOOSING THE OTHER STACK OF FRIED RINGS OOK AT SO WE'RE ABOUT TO SITERE ABOUT TO BIT ED TO THE SIMULTANEOUSLY WHICH WE BOTH THINK THIS WAS CALUMARI BUT THERE' TH E OFFICER OFFICER ONES AGAN SO IN ACTUALITY SATH IS RIGHT SATH IS EATING CALUMARI THE CHEWING YOU HERE FROM BRYAN'S MIE THAT IS THE TOUND OF A CALUMARI LOVER EATING TRIED PICK RACTIM I SHOULD ALSO ADD THEU WERE ACTUALLY TWO VARIETIES OF BNG ON THE PLATE THAT DAY ONE BUNG THAT MY SISTER HAD BLANCHED OVER AND OVER TO MELLOW ANY ORGANY FACL FLAVOR AND THEN UNTREATED STRAIGHT UT BUNGS ON FILTERED UNCHAINED UNCUT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT PURE BUNG THAT ONE THE LATTER ONE BUNG

WAS RIGHT GAME SAT MATCH BUNG AND IT WASN'T JUST BRYAN I THOUGHT SO DAMIAN WHO MANAGES THE RESTAURANT HE ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS PASSABLE A FEW OF US PICKED UP A FAINT FLAVOR OF PORTGRINE BUT IF YOU WEREN'T REALLY LOOKING FOR IT YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE IT WAS THERE ONE OF THE RESTAURAND STAFF A GINING EATEN VAN BURIAN HAD THE SIMPLEST CLEAREST EXPLANATION E I THINK THAT WHEN YOUSLIGHE SOMETHING UP WITHIN TE DEBRIEDITS IN AT IS LIKE SOMETHING ITS BEN DEPRAT IF IF A PLATEFUL THE BUNG CAME OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK WULD WOULD EVEN LIKE DO YOU THINK YOUD NOTICE IF YOU WERE IN THAT SATIN I SA TOPSINARIO IS SOMEBODY SAYS THIS CALUMARY TASTES FUNNY AND KEUPS SEIT AND AS FOR BRYAN O BRYAN BRYAN WAS REALING A BIT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT JUST WHAT THIS WAS GE A MEAN FOR HIM IM I I'M SURE IT BEEN

DIDN'T WANT TO EAT THE CALUMARY ON THE PLATE IN FRONT OF HIM CALUMARY I GUARANTEED HIM WAS REAL JUST TO REPEAT ONE LAST TIME I HAVE NO PROOF THAT ANYONE ANYWHERE HAS EVER TRIED TO PASS OFF PORK BUNG AS CALUMARI IN A RESTAURANT ALL I KNOW IS IF YOU WANTED TO DO IT IT WOULD BE EASY AND I'M CHOOSING TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S HAPPENING SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THAT' SOME POINT IN WORKING ON THIS STORY I STOPPED IDENTIFYING WITH BRYAN AND ANY ONE WHO MIGHT FEEL REDOFF  GROW STOUT BY GETTING IMITATION INSTEAD OF THE REAL THING NOW I IDENTIFY WITH THE BUNG AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW UNDER A HEAT LAMP A PLATER IS SITTING IT'S WARM AND IT'S FULL OF PROMISE AN TRANSFORMATION AND REDEMPTION THAT'S THE WORLD THAT I'LL CHOOSE TO LIVE IN FOR ME FOR YOU FOR THE BUNG FOR THE BUNG IN

BEFORE HE DIED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN JONATHAN WAS ON OUR SHOW A COUPLE F TIMES AND THIS INTERVIEW THAT WENT TO PLAY YOU NOW IT'S RETHIS CONVERSATIONS THAT JUST IT HINDED IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THEN IT BEGAN AS YOU HEAR IT ENDED WITH HIM TALKING ABOUT IIDO YOU KNOW EXECT LE WOU TO CALL BUT LIKE THE NATURE OF EATING BUT IT BEGAN WITH JONATHAN EXPLAINING TO ME HOW HE ENDED UP LIVING WITH A CHICKEN HE EXPLAINED THAT THAT HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT WHEN HE WAS IN HIS TWENTIES HE WAS NOT LIVING THE KIND OF LIFE ONE USUALLY ASSOCIATES WITH CHICKENS THIS WAS DURING THE PERIOD WHEN I CONSIDERED MYSELF TO BE A PERFORMANCE ARTIST OF SORT IN  NAKED PERFORMANCE ARTIST TO BE SPECIFIC HE WAS PUTTING TOGETHER A PERFORMANCE HE HAD A PIA SYSTEM WHICH COULD PUT OUT THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF ANNOYING FEEDBACK SOUND AT HIGH DECIPLES HE HAD THE TWO FULL BOTTLES OF GLADE AMERICAN BEAUTY AIR OF FRESHENER WHICH HE WOULD SPRY IN THEIR ENTIRETY IN THE PERFORMAN SPACE AND HE HAD A LIVE CHICKEN WHICH HE BOUGHT THE DAY BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE ONE OF THOS CHINESE POULTRY MARKETS IN MOSANGELIS AND  COMES TO DAY OF THE SHELL AND AUDIANCES GATHERENG IN A DARKENED WAREHOUSE IN WEST DELA I DON'TNOW IF OU'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF PERFORMANCE ART BUT THIS WAS SORT OF REALLY TIPICAL OF THE STUFF THAT WAS GOING ON OF THE PERIOD AND I SHOWED UP AEND I WAS NAKED AND I WAS CARRYING MACHETTING D I WAS BLIND  AND I STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PILE OF SUPERMARKET CHICKENS OU KNOF THE THE BROILERS YOU BY ANDTHE CHICKEN THAT IH BOUGT WAS TETHERED TO A THREE FOOT ROPE AROUND ME ANDS I HACK UP AND DOWN BLINDLY WITH THE MACHETTY TOWARD THE CHICKEN OR JUST IN GENERAL WEL WIS BLINDFOLD ESIDE ENOUGH WAS TOWARDS THE CHICKEN OR NON AND I HAD FULLY INTENDED THAT FACT I WOULD KILL THE CHICKEN MISS O EFOR BUT CHICKEN'S ART THAT STUPID AND THIS CHICKEN WANTED NO PART OF THE MACHETTHE STATED THE END OF IS ROPE THE ENTIRE TIME APPARENTLY AND AFTER TEN MINUTES WHEN AS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED I FELL TO A HEAT AND EVERYBODY LEFT AND THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER I DON'T NOW IF YOU'VE STUCK AROUND AFTER AN OUR PERFORMANCE BUT THE FEW MINUTES AFTER AN AUR PERFORMANCE ARE THE SOME OF THE MOST DOPPRESSING IN THE WORLD HOWSA AH YOU'VE YOU'VE DONE YOUR WAD YOU'VE DONE YER SORT OF BIT FOR ART WHICH HAS SEE THE WORKER HAUSAD BUT YOU'RE SITTING THERE YOU'RE COVERED WITH CHICKEN TO FLUBIAN MY CASE IT STINKS TO HIGH HELL EVERYBODY'S GONE AND YOU'VE GOT A CLEAN UP AND YOUR NAKEN ITS REALLY NOT A PRETTY TELL JONATHAN CLEANED UP AND WHEN HE WAS DONE HE HAD A CHICKEN AND HE DIDN'T FEELIKE HE COULD KILL THE CHICKEN DESTINY HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER HE FELT LIKE HE COULD NOT TURN HIS BACK HE SAYS IT WAS THE SAME AS IF A KICKEN CHOWS UP ON YOUR BACK DOOR SCRATCHING LONELY NEEDY SO WE TOOK THE CHICKEN HOME AND IN DOING THAT HE STUMBLED ACROSS THAT TENIN LINE THAT SEPARATES FOOD ITAMS ON THE ONE HAND FROM PATS ON THE OTHER THAT DEVISED THE ANIMALS WE EAT FROM THE ANIMALS WE LOV SO I GET HOME AND I I HAVE THE CHICKEN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT SO I SPREAD OUT SOME NEWSPAPER ON THE TOP OF MY REFRIGERATOR AND I PUT THE CHICKEN UP THERE IGET A CAN OF A GREEN GIANT BREAD NIBLETS FROM UNDER THE COUNTER AND I I OPENED IT D I PUT IN A LITTLE BOWL FOR TH CHICKEN AND I GIVE THE CHICKEN A LITTLE WATER AND THE CHICKENS ON TOP OF MY REFRIGERATOR CAUSE YOUCAUSE YOU THINK CHICKENS EAT COIN YOU HAD READ THAT OR SOMETHING AND THOSE THAT WAS THE AVAILABLE COIN THOWAS THE AVAILABLE CORNER I I WISH I HAD THOUGHT BETTER OF THE NIBLET'S IDEA WHY BECUS IN FACT IF YOU'RE BUYING THREE OR FOUR CANDS OF NIBBLET TO DAY WHICH IS WHATH THE CHICKEN AID AND YOUR EXISTING ON ALMOST NOTHING WHICH I WAS THEN YOUR NIBBLET BILL TURNS OUT TO BE LIKE SOME YOU KNOW TWO FIGURE PER CENT E OF ER TOTAL ICOMIN CHOKY I REAR YOU COULD IMAGINE LIVING ON FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK IF BUT TEN DOLLARS OF A GHOST FOR NIBLYOU S JUST HARD TO JUSTIFY AN EXPENSE LIKE THAT THOUGH AT THE REMOVE OF FIFTEEN YEARS I THINK I CAN PROBABLY SAFELY ADMICKING NOW IT ONE OF

CHICKEN IF I MIGHT SAY WHO HAS SEEN YOU NAKED THE CHICKEN DID SEE ME NAKED DAMN IT THE FACT IS WE NEED FOOD TO BE JUST FOOD AND IT' SOON AS TO BECOMES A LIVING THING ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE CITY PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHAN I USED TO THE CONVERSION OF LIVING THINGS IN TO OUR FOOD  IT'S IT'S HARD IT'S TRIED TO HANDLE WITHOUT THINKING IT HAS TO BE BIGGER THAN FOOD YOU KNOW WITHOUT WANTING TO MAKE IT MITUALIZED OR SOMETHING BIGGER THAN FOOD EXACTLY CI TELL YOU A SHORT A SMALL STORE YET OF COURSE ONM A FEW WEEKS AGO I WAS IN THIS CREAN RESTAURANT ING CREATOWN N LOSS HANTELESS IT WAS THIS PLACE CALLED THE LIVING FISH CENTER THAT I'D ALWAYS WANTED TO GO BECAUSE THE NAME OF IT WAS SO SPLENDID IN A LIVING FISH CENTER I IMAGINE YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF LIKE VAST VIVARIAN WORD LIKE FLIPPER WAS JUMPING THROUGH HOOPS AND STUFF AND I GO IN THERE AND OF COURSE IT'S JUST LIKE A PRIMY CRE IN RESTAURANT I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT THAT CLEAN AND I DON'T KNOW THAR TANKS AND STUFFD I DON'T O WHAT TO ORDER SO I ORDER  A FISH SOUP CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE A SMALL FISH SOUP SPECIALTY ON THE MANU AND IT COMES IN ITS JUST REALLY STRONG SMELLING NOT THAT GRAN AND I TRY SQUID FRIED WITH BEING SAUCE AND ONIONS WHICH WAS IT WASN'T THAT HAPPENING AND I'M ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND PAY THE CHACK CAN GO HOME WITH THE AVAST TABLE FILLED WITH I NEEDN'T STUFF AND I SUDDENLY CURSED ME WITH THE SPECIAL TO THE RESTAURAN IS AND E MY WAY THE WATRESS OVER AND I TELL HER THAT I'D LIKE A PRAWN AND SHEUST PUZZLES SHE DIDN'T EXPECT ME TO ASK FOR A PRAN BUT I REPEAT MY QUESTIONS AND SHE SHRUGS AND GOES AND TELLS THE SUSHY SHEF AND HE GOES TO ONE SIDE OF THE RESTAURANT HE CLIMBS ON THIS CHAIR THIS ORDINARY FOLDING CHAIR AND HE REACHES INTO THIS LONG TANK THIS RUNNING JUST BELOW THE CEILING AND HE WIGGLES HIS FINGERS IN THE WATER WHEN HE WIGGLES T FINGERS THE PRANSE JUST BECOME ENRAGED AND THEY START NOW NIPPING IT HIS FINGERS AND THEY START ATTACKING HIM AND HE PICKS OUT A COUPLE OF THE LIVELIEST ONE AND BRINGS THEM BACK TO HIS COUNTER AND WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS MON YOU JUST MAKES A FEW MOTIONS OVER IT AND A COUPLESACKOND SLIDE O THE WATRESS COMES OVER WITH THE PRNE ON THIS HUGE DOWN OF ICE  WHAT HE DONE IS YOU TAKEN OFF THE EGGS ESS GELLAN HEAT ESSENTIALLY LIKE THE HEAD WAS INTACK AND THAT LITTLE PART OF THE TAIL THE IS ALWAYS ON PRAWNE IS L THERE BUT THE MIDDLE PART IS NAKED LIKE A GRUB AND I PICKED UP THE PRON WITH MY CHOPSTICKS AND IT WAS NOT DEAD THIS PRAWNT IT WAS EXTREMELY ALIVE AND IT WAS WIGGLING IT'S LEGS AND WAS WIGGLING ITS INTENIS AND ITS EYES WERE LIKE SWIVELING MADLY ON ITS EYESTOCKS D I WAS LOOKING BACK AT ME SEEING ME AS ACTUALLY THE PREDITOR F THI THE CREATURE THAT WAS GON TO EAT IT AND THAT WAS A REALLY FREAKISH MOMENT BECAUSE IS MUCH AS AS MUCH STUFF AS I EAT AND IS LOW LOW AS I EAT ON THE FOOD CHAIN AND AS MANY PRANSS I HAVE DIS PACSHED TO MY LIFE I HAVE NEVER BEFORE KILLED THE LIVING BEING WITH MY TEETH ND HE THE PRAWN KNEU WHATD I WAS GOING TO DO AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO BUT IF I PUT IT DOWN THE PROMTA DIED ANY WAYMENS NOT TO LIVE WITHOUT A CHELL NCE ON YELSEWOULD HAVE EAT IN A BLABLABLASS SO I BIT INTO IT I BID HIS BODY OFF WICH MY TEETH AND THE PRONH JUST RELAXED IN THIS WAY THAT WAS REALLY EARIE AND THE TASTE OF THE CRAWN THE TASTE OF THE MEAT OF IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY YOUAMEAS SWET WAS LIKE IT WAS LIFE COURSING THROUT IT WAS THE MOST LIVE THING I'VE EVER EATEN YOU OBVIOUSLY LITERALLY BUT AGAIN IT WAS FREAKOU WAS GETTING TOO CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL NATURE OF CONSUMPTION WHICH IS KILLING A LIVING CREATURE WITH YOUR TEETH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BIT INTO THE PRON DID YOU ACTUALLY BITE OFF ITS HEAD ITS LIVING HEAD AND AND HAVE ITS HEAD IN ITS EYES IN YOUR MOUTH NO I BIT OFF ITS BODY AND I HELD THE AND I HELD THE HEAD IN MY HANDS SE SAID YOU SEE YOU HELD THE HEAD AND CUN ONE HAND IN THE TAIL IN THE OTHE N YOU BIT THE CENTER RUN ND I THOUGHT THAT I I THOUGHT THAT I KILLED IT BUT IN FACT WHEN I PUT IT DOWN IT WAS STILL HAD SO MUCH LIFE IN IT THAT IT GRABBED A PIECES OF SAMON'S ASHEE AND WOULDN'T THAT GO OF IT AND I DON'T THINK I EVER WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN DID YOU FEIK THERE WAS SOMETHING OF ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE THAT MADE IT MORE THIS WORD IS A LITTLE CORNIER THAN I INTEND BUT SENWAR THAT CAN THINK OF THAT MADE IT MORE SACRED THAT TOOK IT OUT OF THE MUNDANENES OF THE WAY THAT WE EAT WE TRUE MOSTE OF US IS EATING WITHOUT ACTUALLY TASTING AND EXPERIENCE TING AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT WERE EATING AND WHAT ON THE EARTH IT IS THAT WERE KILLING TO SURVIVE DO YOU THINK IN SOME WAY THAT IT'S THAT IT'S MORE IT ACCEPTABLE TO EAT AN ANIMAL IF YOU ARE MORE A WAYK TO THE FACT THAT IT IS AN ANIMAL AND WHAT'S HAPPENED TO IT BUT DO YOU THINK E REALLY DOESN'T MATTER I I THINK IT MATTERS A GREAT DEAL I MEAN ONE OF THE UNO GREATEST METAPHORS AND QUESTION CIVILIZATION T IS THAT OF YOU KNOW CHRIST TO GAVE HIS LIFE SO THAT OTHERS MY LIVE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SACRILEGIOUS AND I DON'T WANT TO DYOU KNON'T BE LITTLE THATMENTH IN ANYWAY BUT A TIK HIS GIVING ITS LIFE SO THAT WE MIGHT CHICKENIST GIVING IS LIFE SO TIT WE MIGHT AND I THINK THE LEAST THAT WE COULD DO IS TO THINK ABOUT THAT CHICKEN TO THINK ABOUT THAT CAF THAT WERE EATING NOT NECESSARILY TO BE SAT FOR IT BUT TO CELEBRATE TO DBEWARE OF THE BEING THAT IT WAS THAT IT WASN'T JUST TO BIT OF YOU KNOW BUYO ENGINEERD PROTIN SOMEHOW MANAGED TO FIND ITS WAN TO OUR PLACES  JONTHIN GOLD THE CURIUS BAT HIS WRITING THI SECLLECTION OF IS COLUMNS CALLED COUNTER INTELLIGENCE  IE MUCH TIME WITH THE KING OF CATCHUP SO I UNDERSHUD IT AY WITH THE STRAY OF A MAN WHO HAS A VERY SIMPLE MISSION IN LIFE TO GIVE A LITTLE SPECIAL TREATMENT TO GOO PEOPLE IF CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRATE WHO WHEN THEY MEET THIS GUY THAND TO GIVE HIM A LTL SPECIAL TREATMENT IN RETURN THE STROY I AS YOU BET TO TELLEN YOU HEAR IT WAS FIRST BREAD CAST LONG BEFORE THE PENDEMIC JOHN OF THE GOLDSTAN WHOSE NAME I KNOW ITS VERY SIMILAR TO THE GUAN IC TOO BUT THAT MEANS NOTHING TELLS THE TALE HOW AR CHACKLITS AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE WERE KIDS AND SO I CAN SAY WITH GREAT AUTHORITY THAT ALMOST EVERY DAY FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS HOW ARE CHACKLITS AYS EITHER DINED OUT OR ORDERED AIN AT LEAST W ONE OF HIS MEALS SOMETIMES WHEN HOWARD IS AND SURE WHAT HE'S IN THE MOOD FOR HE'LL LIFT AN EMPTY HAND UP TO HIS MOUTH AND PRETEND THAT HE'S EATING HE STARE STRAIGHT AHEAD TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF HE LIKES THE TASTE OF THE IMAGINARY FOOD HE IS SHOVING INTO HIS MOUTH SOMETIMES HIS HAND IS HOLDING A HAMMERGER SOMETIMES A FORK RAPPED IN SPEGETTY AND OTHER TIMES HE IS DOUBLE FISTING EITHER END OF AN INVISIBLE PORK RIB HOWARDS ALWAYS LOVED RESTAURANTS HE WAS RAISED IN A JEWISH EASTERN EUROPEAN HOUSEHOLD WERE THE VERY IDEA OF A RESTAURANT WAS AE RIDICULOUS PIECE OF DECADENS SOMETHING FOR COSSACKS IN COCANE ATTICS WHO ENJOYED FLUSHING THEIR MONEY DOWN THE TOILET RESTAURANTS HAD A TRANSGRESSIVE ALLURE AND AS SOON AS HOWARD WAS OLD ENOUGH HE STARTED SNEAKING AWAY TO THEM AFTER SCHOOL OR SOMETIMES ON WEEKANDS WHILE THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS STILL ASLEEP IN FACT HOWARD WAS THE VERY FIRST PERSON I'VE EVER DINED OUT WITH ALONE WITHOUT ANY FAMILY WE WERE TWELVE YEARS OLD AND WE ATE AT A TOMIC SPEETS A REA A PLACE JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM US IT WAS OWNED BY A CROTCHETY OLD GREEK MAN NAMED COSTA WHO SERVED RIDICULOUSLY LARGE PORTIONS OF FOOD WE'D GET A PLAYT O FRIES THE SIZE OF A DEAD SHETLAN PONY BUT RIGHT ALONGSIDE OF IT COSTA WOULD PLACE ONE MEASLY PACKET OF CATCHUP WHEN WE ASKED FOR MORE HE LOOKED AT US LIKE WE HAD JUST ASKED FROM MORE BLOOD FROM HIS MOTHERS STILL BEATING HEART WERE AS I LEARNED TO RASHION EATING FOUR TOR FIVE HUNDRED FRENCH FRIES WITH A BOTTLE CAPSIZED DALLAP HOWARD LEARNED HAD A TALK TO COSTA HOW TO WIN HIM OVER HOW TO MAKE HIM SEE THAT GIVING US MORE CATCHUP WAS JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO ALONG THE WAY HOWARD LEARNED HAW TO SAY IN GREEK THANK YOU KIND SIR BLESS YOU FOR THE CATCHUP AS WELL AS THE EXCELLENT CRONY A POR LAVATAW CETCHUP SAS HEIS MANY YEARS TO YOUR CATCHUP EVER SINCE WAY BACK THEN HOWARD HAS HAD A VERY SPECIAL RE POR WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE FOOD SERVICE

HARTED JOB THAN A WAITER A WAITRUST BECAUSE HE'S A GUYY E TAKES YOUR FOOD GESS INTO A CARB ISHIS LIFE GOES IN TO TRAFFIC COM GET A SECOND RISK HIS LIFE I KNOW HE'S DRIVING TO CARRY E HOWARDS WORK ALL KINDS OF FOOD SERVICE JOBS HIMSELF AS A WAITER A BUSS BOY A SHORT ORDER COOK AND HE SAYS THAT AS A RESULT HE ABSOLUTELY LOATHES THE FEELING OF BEING SERVE THERES SOMETHING THAT JUST FEELS EMBARRASSING AND UNNATURAL ABOUT IT BUT IT EVEN GOES FURTHER THAN THAT IN HIS INTERACTIONS WITH THE SERVICE IN THE STRY HE'S LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR FEELING A KIND OF COSY MOMENT WHERE HE CAN PALPABLY SENSS THAT THE WAITER HAS FORGOTTEN THAT HE IS A WAITER AND THAT THEY ARE BOTH SIMPLY RELATING AS HUMAN BEINGS AND THEN ONCE HE KNOWS THIS ONCE HE KNOWS THERE BOTH GETTING ALONG AND EVERYONE'S HAPPY HE CAN MOVE ON HE ISN'T LOOKING FOR ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM HIS MOTIVES ARE PURE THAT WAY BUT THESE KINDS OF SPECIAL MOMENTS DON'T COME WITHOUT STRINGS ATTACHED AND SOMETIMES HOWARD GETS INTO TROUBLE EARLIER IN THE DAY DURING OUR WALKING TO HER THERE WAS ONE PLACE WE DIDN'T STOP IN TO A LITTLE CONVENIENT STORE AROUND THE CORNER HOWARD BECAME ON CHARACTERISTICALLY SOMBER AND QUIET AS WE WALKED BY THE STORE FRONT WINDOW THE OWNERS A GREEK WOMAN IN HER SIXTY'S NAMED VULA AND HER OLDER SISTER USED TO BE PRETTY FRIENDLY WITH HIM SOMETIMES VULA WOULDN'T CHARGE IN THE TAXS ON HIS TRONCLABAR AND ON OCCASION SHE'D HAVE HIM SIT BEHIND THE COUNTER WITH HER ON A PLASTIC MILK CRATE IT WASN'T MUCH BUT IT WAS STILL MORE THAN WHAT THE OTHER CUSTOMERS GOT AND HIT MADE HOWARD FEEL SPECIAL BUT THEN AT A CERTAIN POINT THINKS STARTED TO GET MORE INTENSE THERE'D BEEN SEVERAL HOLD UPS THERE BY NIFE POINT GUN POINT AND I SEE TH FIBLE BAT FOR THEM IHT SE THEM TO BE SHOOK UP A TH CAT TOUGH LADIES BUT THE NOTHER ALONE AND IS TOLD MYSELF HE KNOW IF IF YOU HAVE AN ANYTHING IS ANY TROUBLE OR SOMETHINGHI STRUN TO CORNY CON ME A CALL AND I REALLY MEANTS IT LIKE HIM IN INCES OF EMERGENCY OR HEAV JUST THAT THERE SOMEBO THY CAN CALL WI SOME CO COMMUNITY SOME HI'VE EFFORT A COMMUNITYTA BUT SHE STARTED SHE RECALL EVERY DAY SHE WOULD CALL HIM FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS TO HAVE HIM COME BY AND FIX THINGS OR TO RUN ERRANDS FOR HER AND HE WOULD TRY HIS BEST TO BE ACCOMMODATING SHE'D EVEN CALL HIM JUST A CHAT EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THIS WAS MORE THAN HOWARD COULD SHOULDER HE WAS RELUCTANT TO PUT AN END TO IT IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE CALLS GOT LATER INTO THE NIGHT AT ONE IN TWO IN THE MORNING THAT HOWARD'S FRIENDS STARTED INSISTING HE TELL HER THAT ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH AND AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT HE DID SO HOWARD WONDERS IF IT WAS RIGHT TO GIVE HER HIS NUMBER IN THE FIRST PLACE I MEED THAT OFFER ASSUMING THAT THAT IT WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE'S A CUT OFF POINT BUT TO ANOTHER PERSON YOU KNOW THAT OFFERS IT IS A REAL GENUINE OFFER IF I NEED HELP I MN T O CALL YOU AND SHE DID AND AND MAYBE SHE'S H ONE IT'S RATE YOU KNOW SO IT'S IRONIC THAT EU KNOW JUST ULIKE BEING NICE TO SOME ONE I SHE HAD THE ADVERS EFFECTS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT AN AND IT IN IS BEING LIKEA DISASTER AND LIKE NONT YOU PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN FRIENDLY WITH EACH OTHER THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER DISASTERS FOR HOWARD DISASTERS WERE HE WAS THE ONE WHO WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR LIKE THERE'S THE TIME HE BECAME SO CONSUMED WITH HELPING THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD CHINESE RESTAURANT THAT WITHOUT BEING ASKED HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO DRAW PAMPHLETS FOR THE PLACE THE OWNER ACCEPTED HOWARD'S FLIERS BUT NEVER CIRCULATED THEM LATER THE OWNER PICKED A SCREAMING FIGHT WITH HOWARD OVER AN ORDER AND HOWARD NEVER WENT BACK AND THEN THERE WAS THE TIME HE BROUGHT IN BEAUTIFUL FRAMED PHOTOES OF LEBINON TO HIS FAVOURITE LEBONYESE RESTAURANT SO THEY COULD BE REMINDED OF HOME BUT THE PHOTOES WERE NEVER HUNG UP NOR WERE THEY EVER REFER TO AGAIN BUT FOR HOWARD THOSE THINGS DON'T MATTER AND I KNOW THAT HE PROBABLY EVEN DO THEM ALL AGAIN THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER MOMENTS THAT MAKE HIS GOOD INTENTIONS FEEL REPAID IN FULL SOME OF HIS FAVORITES ARE WHEN DELIVERY MEN HE KNOWS PASS HIM BY IN THEIR CARS AS HE'S WALKING DOWN THE STREET IT SHOCKS HIM OUT OF HIS REVERY WHEN THEY HUNK THEIR HORNS IN A QUICK AFFECTION AT BURST FOR BRIEF MOMENT IT FEELS LIKE A REASSURING SLAP ON THE BACK HOWARD THINKS TO HIMSELF THAT THEY'RE THE BEST AND IT FILLS HIM WITH SO MUCH GRATITUDE THAT IF HE HAD A PAIR OR PEACH IN HIS COAT POCKET HE WOULD WAVE THEM OVER AND GIVE IT TO THEM

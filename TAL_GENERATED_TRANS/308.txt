REBECGA REMEMBERS EXACTLY WHEN YHOU WEARN THE ASTONISHING TRUTH SHESN SECOND GRATE I MAN IN TO WERE BEST RUND RACHEL ITS SCHOOL ONE DAY AND SHE PULLED ME ASIDE AND AND SAID YOU KNOW LAST NIGHT AT YOU KNW I LOST THE TOOTH AND I WOKE UP WELL THE TOOTHFAIRY WAS PUTTING THE MONEY UNDER MY PILLOW AND GESS TO THE TOOTHFAIRY WAS IT SAID O MY GOD WHO WAS IT I I HAVE TO KNOW AND SHE SAID MY DAD MY DAD IS THE TOOTHFARY AND I REMEMBER RUNNING HOME AFTER SCHOOL AND TELLING MY MA'M MIM I KNOW WE THE TOOTHFAIRYOUS AND DECLARING IT AS IF I HAD GROWN UP THAT I I KNEW WHO WHO THE TOOTHFAIRY WS AND SHE SAID OL  WELL WHO IS THE TOOTHFAIRY AND I TURNE TO HER AND I SAID RACHEL'S DAD IS THE TOOTHFAIRY RONNIE LOVER FELL IS THE TOOTHFAIRY AND SHE SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU NOW IT'S TOTALLY SECRET YOU CAN'T LET ANY ONE ELSE KNOW BUT YOUR RIGHT RONNIE IS THE TOOTHFAIRY AND YOU KNOW HE WORKS REALY HARD AND YOU KNOW IT'S THE SECRET AS YOU CAN'T LET ANY ONE ELSE NOW HE IS THE TOOTHFAIR WYU CAN'T LET ANYONE ELSE NOW AND FROM THAT DAY ON RONNIE RONNIE LOVERFELT WITH TOOTHFAIRY AND I'LL OF MY NOTES UNDER MY PILLOW WERE SIGNED LOVE RONNIE LEV AS FELT NOW I'M IN HIS DAY JOB WHAT ID RUNNIN OVER FELT DO I THINK HE DID SOMETHING IN FINE AUNCE WHOS EITHER AN ACCOUNT AN OR A STOCK BROKER YEU WORK NEXT TO A STOPING SHOP AN MASKE THOTH SETS IN NEWTON A DARK HAIR WORSE TOO NI DEFTLY HAD IMAGES OF HIS DRIVING HIS VOLVER AROUND E BOSSTONARYA AND DELIVERING THE TOOTHFARY TREATS I REMEMBERING WONDERING WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR RACHEL TO KNOW THAT HER DAD WAS THE TOOTHFAIRY AND DEFTLY BEING LITTLE ENVIOUS THAT HER DAD HAD THE SPECIAL JOB IN THE SPECIAL POWER AND THAT HE HAD THIS WHOLE OTHER INTERESTING LIFE FOR MY JED DEST CAME HOME FROM WORK AND THAT WAS IT SO WHEN YOU WOULD ACTUALLY RUN INTO RUNNING OVERFELD WHAT WAS I LIKE FOR YOU HOW WOULD YOU ACT I TRI TACTCOOL I DIDN'T WANT ANY KNOTES LIKE IF YOUR STAR STROCK BUT YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT YOUR STAR STROCK SOS IK MEANING A CELEBRITY EXACTLY YOU DOWN PLAY IT YOU TRY NOT TO MENTION AT BUT YOU DEFINITELY CHECK THEM OUT TWICE AND AND YOU KNOW LOOK AT THEM WHEN THEY WALK AWAY I GO MY GOT FOR THE TOOTHFARY BUT YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO PLAY A COOL AND KNOW ENOUGH TO PLAKE CAL I SAID HAY HOW YOU DO AND I YOU KNOW WHAT'S FOR DINNER HI'W M GETTING HOME TO NIGHT HOW MY PARENTS GEN TO PICK ME UP IF THEY CALL YOU DID PLAY AT CORL WHEN INTSHESTING QUESTION IN ALL THIS WHY DID BOTH GIRLS COME TO WHAT SEEMS LIKE THE LEAST LIKELY CONCLUSION FROM THE EVIDENCE IN FRONT OF THEM OF A PARENT SWAPPING MONEY FOR A TOOTH UNDER A PILLOW WHE I WASN'T GOT NMIX STUDIES HELL CHILDREN THING SHE SAYS OF COURSE IT'S LOGICAL FOR A SEVEN YEAR OLD TO CONCLUDE THAT HER OWN DAD MIGHT BE THE TOOTHFAIRY CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THAT THEIRE PARENTS FOR INSTANCE AR POWERFUL IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS THAT  MAKE THEM VERY DIFFERENT FROM CHILDREN I NOW FROM A CHILD'S POINT OF VIEW KNOWING WHERE THOSE POWERS BEGIN AND AND IS PRETTY TRICKY I MEAN TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT YOUR PARENTS CAN DO THAT YOU CAN'T DO AND THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE ISN'T ANY OBVIOUS EXPLANATION ABOUT WHY YOUR FATHER CAN USE OF EASI CART FOR INSTANCE I KNOW WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T DO I THE POWER TO BE A TOOTHFAIRY ISN'T ALL THAT MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE ITS A CERTAIN CON OF STORY THAT COULDS TELL IT THE RONING WOER FELT STORY HET THEY WILL GET SOMETHING GOING ON AROUND THEM OBSERVE IR CAREFULLY THI ABOUT IT LOGICALLY I ONE THING CONNEXTS TO THE NEXT THING TO THE NEXT AND THEN COME TO CONCLUSIONS THAT AR COMPLETELY IN CORRECT THERRE MIST AGLIN GOLMAN IN TEXAS TELLS THIS STORY BETTER LITTE GIRL IN THEIR PLAN THEN SHE WAS ABOUT FOR EARS ORD AND HER VERY FIRST FLIHTS AND AS THE PLAIN WAS EIR BORN SHE TURNED TO THE WOMAN NEXT TO HER AND SAID WHEN DO WE GET SMALLER THAT HAD BEEN THEIR EXPERIENCE AT EIRPORTS WATCHING AIRPLANES TAKE OFF THEY DO GET SMALISTORIES ARE LIKE JOKS ANDTH ROSSA LIKE POEMS I THINK BECAUSE THERES IS A HO QUALITY TO THEM SOME CONNECTION IS MADE BETWEEN THINGS SURPRISEING CONNECTION A WRONG CONNECTION ACTUALLY WELL BE AT THIS AMERICAN LIFE LOVE THESE STORIES AND SO TO DAY WE BRING YOU A FULL HOUR OF THEM  DH YOU BE ASY CHICAGO IS THIS AMERICAN LIFE A MIRA GLASS TO DAY IN OUR PROGRAM KID LOGIC ARE SHOWING FOR ACTS AT ONE BABY SCIENTISTS WITH FAULTY DATA A TWO WHERE WILS IN THEIR YOUTH AS SERY FOR MICHAEL SHAPE ON A THREE THE GAMININ OVER TO THE FATS O MAN THINGS AT FOR WHEN SMALL FOUGHTS ME BIG GRAINS STAY WITH US IKE ONE BABY SCIENTISTS WITH FAULTY DATA THIRTY YEARS AGO PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT BABIES COULD NOT THINK AT ALL THAT THEY WERE IRRATIONAL IN A LOGICAL SELF SENDED LITTLE BALLS OF NEED AND WONT WHAT SCIENCE AS WEARNT IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IS THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE THE CHILDREN ARE OBSERVING THE WORLD AND THINKING ABOUT IT AND COMING TO LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE DAY THEY'RE BORN NALLISON GOPENIT AND TWO OVER COLLEAGUES DECIDED TO SUNRISE A LOT OF THIS RESEARCH IN A BOOK THEY CALLED IT THE SCIENTIST IN THE CRIB MANY THE BABIES ARE LIKE LITTLE SCIENTISTS THEY ARGUE THAT WEN A SMALL BABY SITS IN A HIGH CHAIR AND DROPS A SPOON ON TO THE FOR OVER AND OVER AND OVER FOR MAMOR DEAD TO PICK UP WHAT THE BABY IS DOING ESSENTIALLY IS RUNNING A LITTLE BABY SIZED EXPERIMENT BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT BABIES ARE VERY INTERESTED IN GRAVITY AND HOW GRAVITY WORK THE THIT FACT THAT THINGS FULL DOWN AN NOT UP IS NOT OBVIOUS TO BABIES I AND IT TURNS OUT ANOTHER FING THER VERY INTERESTED IN IS HUMAN BEINGS AND HOW THEY WORK WE ARE ACTUALLY THE LABRATS THERE ACTUALLY DOING EXPERIMENTS ALL AN OS TO SEE HOW WE GEG SO WHEN YOU PLAINDROP THIS BO WHEN YOU GEN TO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE YOU GET AND EXPERIMENT ABOUT GRAVITY YOU GET A LITTLE PHYSICS TUTORIAL AND YOU GET A PSYCHOLOGY TITORIL YOU CAN SEE ABOUT HOW THAT PERSON A WELL DO SOMETHING OVER IN OUBERING WHILE KIDS THINK WITH THE SAME LOGIC THAT ITDELTS US AND APPLY THAT LOGIC JUST AS RIGOROUSLY THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT THEY SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW AND TAKE A WILD OF FIGURE OUT UP THE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD FOR INSTANCE IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR TO ANYONE WHAT IS IMAGINARY AND WHAT IS NOT OR IF WISHING FOR SOMETHING CAN MAKE IT COME TRUE THERE'S A WONDERFUL EXPERIMENT ABOUT THIS ACTUALLY THAT POHARIS IN ENGLAND IT A WHERE HE GOT CHILDREN TO AMAGIN A THAT SOMETHING WAS IN A BOX SO HE WOULD SAY OCADE NOW HERE'S THIS BOX WORE WEN OPEN OUPIING A CLOSET A NOW IT'S IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A PUPPY IN THIS BOX OR ELSE LET'S IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A MONSTER IN THE BOX A AND HE ASKED THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW IS THERE REALLY A MONSTER IN THE BOX IS THERE REALLY A POPPY ING TH BOX THEY SID NOW THEY WERE JUST IMAGINING IT THEN THE RESEARCHER WOULD WALK OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE BOX BEHIND WITH THE CHILD TAND THEN SOMETHING FUNNY WOULD HAPPEN THE KIDS WHO WERE TOLD TO IMAGIN A POPPY IN THE BOX WOULD GO OVER AND PIQE INSIDE THE BOX JUST A CHECK AND THE IDS WHO WERE TOLD THAT THRE WAS A MONSTER IN THE BOX THEY WOULD EDGE AWAY FROM THE BOX SO THERE WORE CAN IT TAKE ANY CHANCES JUST IN CASE WISHING ACTUALLY COULD MAKE MONSTERIS HABIN A THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT BOX BUT BY THE TIME THE CHILDREN ARE SIX OR SEVEN THEY LIK GROWN UPS THEY'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT JUST WISHING FOR THINGS ISN'T GOING ACTIALLY MAKTHING HW WHEN THET'S JO SMALL AND IN EXPERIENCE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD CHILDREN HAVE TO MAKE LOGICAL INFERENCES ALL THE TIME BASED ON THE DAY THAT THEY DO HAVE HERE IS HOW JHUDCHAN RESPONDED WHEN OUR PRODUCER JONATHAN GOLDSTIN ASKED THEM ABOUT THE TOOTHFARY WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE DOES WITH ALL F THESE TEETH THAT SHE'S COLLECTING WAY SHE GAE THI PEOPLE AT ATTEH LIKE WHO OH PEOPLE WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE DOES WITH ALL THESE TEETH  SEES LIKE THE COLLEKE TEETH AND MAKE THINGS I EY WHAT KIN TO STUFF I I THAV A TWO HOW TO TWELVE FEET AND I TO STA HOW MANY TEET TEF THIN  TAKES TO MAKE A TOOTH HOUSE I D  I DAN WHY WHEN SHE JUST MAKE THE HOUSE AUT OF BRICK  LIKE IT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I O I ELIN TE I  A LIKE TEET THESE STORIES WHERE KID TAKE A PERFECTALY LOGICAL PREMISE AND GO THROUGH A SERIES OF PERFECTLY LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS THAT WE DO PERFECTLY INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS JUNT SAID THAT SCIENCE DOES NOT HAVE A NAME FOR THESE STORIES WHICH IS SURPRISING GIVEN HOW COMMON THEY ARE AND HOW THEY IR RECOGNIZED AROUND THE WORLD FOR THEIR SHEER ENTERTAINMENT VALUE HERE WE'VE COLECTED A FEW MORE WE LIVED IN TA DUPLAX THE DUPLAXES DIRECTLY TO THE LEFT IN THE RIGHT OF US WERE AUNTS AND UNCLE ACROSS E TREET FROM US ALL ANS AND UNCLES SO IT WAS NO SUCH THING AS WALKING OUT TISTAING A STRANGE I JUST LIKE WE

AS SAWL THESE THES COUPLE SID NAT THESE TWO PEOPLE BUT THEY WERE PEOPLE THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE WHITE PEOPLE AND BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN WHITE PEOPLE I AS SUME THAT THEY WERE GHOSTS SO I WAVES LIKE YOU KNOW I WONDER IF I WAVE WOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE THEY WHAT THEY DO THEY TALK SO I WAVED AND I REMEMBER HEARING THE MAN GOING   WHILL

KIDS THINKING LIKE KIDS TIT'S AN EXIPTOSORT STORY BY MICHAEL SHAPE ON I HAD KNOWN HIM AS A BULL DOZER AS A SOMERAI AS AN ANDROID PROGRAMME TO KILL AS PLASTIC MAN AND TITANIA MAN AND MATTER EATER LAD AS A BEWIC ELECTRA AS A PETERBUILT TRUCK AND EVEN FOR A WEEK AS THE MACKANAL BRIDGE BUT IT WAS AS A WEAREWOLF THAT TIMOTHY STOKES FINALLY WENT TOO FAR I WASN'T THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED I WAS DOWN IN THE RAVINE AT THE EDGE OF THE SCHOOL YARD FOUNDING A CAPITAL FOR AN EMPIRE OF ANTS IAD JUST BEGUN TO DESCRIBE TO MY SOUTH AND TO THE ANTS THE COMPLICATED RIGHT SACRED TO THE GOD WHOSE WORSHIP I WAS IMPOSING ON THEM WHEN I HEARD THE FIRST SCREAMS FROM THE PLAYGROUND THE GIRL SCREAMED AT TIMOTHY THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME HE CAME AFTER THEM IN UNISON AND WITH A THRILL THAT SOUNDED ALMOST LIKE DELIGHT AS IF THEY WERE WATCHING THE FAMILY CAT TROT PASSED WITH SOMETHING BLOODY IN ITS JAWS I SCRAMBLED UP THE SIDE OF THE RAVINE AND EMERGED HAS TIMOTHY SHOULDERS HUNCHED ARMS OUTSTRETCHED GROWLED RE ILISTICALLY AND DECLARED THAT HE WAS HUNGRY FOR THE THROAT OF PUNY HUMAN EN TIMOTHY SAID THIS OR SOMETHING LIKE IN EVERY TIME HE TURNED INTO A WARE WILFON I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TOO CONCERNED OF AND THE COURSE OF HIS LAST TRANCE FOR MATION HE HAD NAXTUALLY GONE AN BIT AND VIRGINIA PES ON THE NECK IT WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE AROUND SCHOOL THAT VIRGINIA'S PARENTS HAD SINCE WRITTEN A LETTER TO THE PRINCIPAL AND AND THE NEXT TIME TIMOTHYS SDOKES HURT SOMEBODY HE WAS GOING TO BE E SPELL TIMOTHY WAS IN OUR TEACHER MISSUS GLADFELTER'S WORDS ONE STRIKE AWAY FROM AN OUT AND THERE WAS A WIDE SPREAD IF UNARTICULATED HOPE AMONG HIS CLASSMATES THEIR PARENTS AND ALL OF THE TEACHERS THAT COPLAND FORK ELEMENTARY THAT ONE DAY SOON HE WOULD PROVIDE THE AUTHORITIES WITH THE EXCUSE THEY NEEDED TO PACK HIM OFF TO SPECIAL SCHOOL I STOOD THERE A WHILE ABOVE MY LITTLE CITY WATCHING TIMOTHY PURSUE US SNARLING BLUEBINE CORSE ALONG THE HOPSCOTCH CROSSES I KNEW THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING TO CALM HIM DOWN BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE AND OUR SCHOOL WHO COULD HAVE ANY REASON TO WONT TO SAVE TIMOTHY STOKES FROM EXPULSION AND I HATED HIM WITH ALL MY HEART ND     I FI HAVE BEEN CURSED FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS WHO DE CLAIM HE WAS WEARING HIS STANDARD UNIFORM OF WHITE DUNGERIES AND A PLAIN WHITE UNDERSHIRT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A CHILLY AFTERNOON IN OCTOBER AND ALL THE REST OF US HAD LONG SINCE BEEN BUNDLED UP FOR AUTUMN AND CORDUROY AND DOWN I HAVE BEEN CURSED TO STALK THE NIGHT THROUGH ALL ETERNITY HE WENT ON I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR PRAY AS LOVELY AS YOU HE LUNGED TOWARD THE NEAREST WALL OF THE CAGE OF GIRLS AROUND HIM THE GIRLS PEELED AWAY FROM HIM AS THOUGH SPRAYED WITH A HOSE BUMP SHOULDERS CLUNG SHRIEKING TO EACH OTHER SLEEVES SOME OF THEM WERE SINGING THE SONG WE SANG ABOUT TIMOTHY STOKES TMOTHY STOKES TIMOTH STOKES HE GOING TO THE HOME FOR CRAZY FOLKS AND THE ONE SINGING THE LOUDEST WAS VIRGINIA PEES HERSELF AND HER FURRY BLACK COAT AND HER BRIGHT RED TIGHTES VIRGINIA HAD BLOND HAIR AND SHE WAS THE ONLY GIRL IN THE FIFTH GRADE WITH PIERCED EARS AND PAINTED FINGER NAIL AND TIMOTHY STOKES WAS IN LOVE WITH HER I KNEW THIS BECAUSE THE STOKESAS LIVED NEXT DOOR TO US AND I WAS PRIVY TO ALL KINDS OF SECRETS ABOUT TIMOTHY THAT I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE TO KNOW I FORBADE MYSELF WITH AN ALMOST RELIGIOUS SEVERITY TO SHOWED TIMOTHY ANY KINDNESS OR REGARD I WOULD NEVER LET HIM SIT BESIDE ME AS LUNCH OR IN CLASS AND IF HE TRIED TO TALK TO ME ON THE PLAYGROUND I AGNORED HIM WHO WAS BAD ENOUGH THAT I HAD TO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO HIM IT WAS TOWARD VIRGINIA THAT TIMOTHY NOW ADVANCE A RATLING GROWL IN HIS THROAK SHE DREW BACK BEHIND HEUR GIRL FRIENDS AND THEIR SCREAMING NOW GREW LESS MELODIOUS LESS PURELY FORMAL TIMOTHY CROUCHED DOWN ON ALL FORCE HE ROLLED HIS WILD WHITE EYES AND TOOK A LAST LOOK AROUND HIM THAT WAS WHEN HE SAW ME HALF WAY ACROSS THE YELLOW DISTANCE OF THE SOCKERFIELD HE WAS LOOKING AT ME I THOUGHT AS THOUGH HE HOPED I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING I WANTED TO TELL HIM INSTANTLY I DROPP FLAD ON MY BELLY MY HEART POUNDING THE WAY IT DID WHEN I WAS SPOTTED TRYING TO SPY ON A BASEBOG GAME OR BIRTHDAY PARTY I SLID DOUN INTO THE RAVINE BACKWARD AT FIRST I COULD HEAR THE GIRLS SHOUTING FOR MISSUS GLADFELTER AND THEN I HEARD MISSUS GLADFELTER HERSELF SOUNDING VERY ANGRY AND THE BELL SOUNDED THE END OF RECESS AND EVERYTHING GOT VERY QUIET BUT I JUST STAYED THERE IN THE RAVINE I TOLD MYSELF THAT I DIDN'T FEEL SORRY AT ALL FOR STUPID OLD TIMOTHY STOKES BUT THEN I WOULD REMEMBER THE CONFUSED LOOK IN HIS EYES AS I HAD ABANDONED HIM TO HIS FATE TO ALL THE UNIMAGINABLE THINGS THAT WOULD BE DONE TO HIM IN THE FABULOUS CORRIDORS OF THE SPECIAL SCHOOL I KEPT RECALLING SOMETHING THAT I HAD HEARD TIMOTHY'S MOTHER SAY TO MIND JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS EARLIER YOU KNOW ALTHEAS

ACTION COMMICES  ME  ME      ACK FOR AND SMALL THOUGHTS MEET TO BIG BRAINS I CEY SAW ALL THIS HOUR WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT KIDLODJEC AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE INCORRECT LOGIC OF CHILDHOOD DASN'T I GET CORRECTED DURING CHILDHOOD IT DOESN'T IT GET CORRECTED TILL MUCH MUCH LATER WHEN CHILDHOOD IS LONG OVER HALKMOMBERG EXPLAINS I CAN RECONSTRUCT THE EVENTS THAT LI MADE AT ONE OF THE MOST EMBARRASSING CONVERSATIONS OF MY ADULT LIFE THE CHAIN STARTS BACK WHEN I WAS ELEVEN OR TWELVE AND I FIRST HEARD THE TERM NILSON FAMILY I'S PROBABLY LISTENING TO SOME ADULTS TALK AND FROM THEIR CONVERSATION I GATHERED THAT NETWORKS CONSULTED NILSON FAMILIES TO FIND OUT HOW POPULAR A TELLIVISHON SHI WAS BUT THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE WHY WOULD THEY ONLY ASK PEOPLE NAMED NILSON WHICH SHOWS THEY LIKED SO DID THINKING I KNEW THAT WHEN THEY FICGURED THINGS LIKE THIS OUT THEY DIDN'T ASK EVERYBODY THEY JUST TATS A SMALL PERSENAT IV PEOPLE AND THAN EXTRAPOLATED I THINK I FICGUE THEY'D DONE SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THE NAME NAILSON BECAUSE WAS A COMMON NAME MAYBE AND IAD SEEMED TO CUT A CROSS CLASS AN ECONOMIC LANCE ACTUALLY CAME PRETTY CLOSE TO A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE I KNEW THIS WASN'T THE WAY THEY MEASURED PUBLIC OPINION NOW BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THE NAILSON SURVEYS HAD BEEN AROUND FOR WHILE AND I FIGURED THEY WRE JUST TO HOLD OVHER FROM O MORE PRIMITIVE LESTATISTICALLY REGOROUS TIME AFTER THAT I RELATEDN'T THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN OR IF I DID IT WAS ONLY WITH A MILD CURIOSITY I WONDE WY TYVEESTILL DOESN'T THAT WAY FAS'S FORWARD TWENTY YEARS I WAS TALKING WITH A FRIEND OF MINE WHO AS TELLING ABOUT HER FRIEND WHO'D BEEN SELECTED TO BE IN NILSON FAMILY AND I SAID TO HER IS NOT WEARD THAT THEI'RE ALL NAMED NEILSON MY FRIEND LOOKED AT ME FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE A LONG TIME SOMEWHERE

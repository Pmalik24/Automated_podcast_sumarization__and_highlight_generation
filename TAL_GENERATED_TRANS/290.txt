THE PARADE IT'S CALLED JUVAT AND ITS HA CELEBRATION WITH DEEP DEEP ROOTS IN THE CARIBIAN JU RASE MITHOLOGY IS POPULATED WITHOUTLANDISH CHARACTERS LIKE THE MENACING MIDNIGHT ROBBER WITH HIS WIDE BRIMMED HAT THE INSAMELY VOLUPTUOUS DAME ARAIN AND THE MANY DEVILS RIDER A MIGHTY BROWN GREW UP WITH JUVAY BUT SHE DID NOT SHE STOT GOING UNTIL SHE GOT TO BROOKLYN HER STORY STARTS OVER TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY IN TRINADA CARNIVL IS SO BIG THAT SHE STUDY IT IN SCHOOL THE YEAR I TURNED TEN WE WERE GIVEN ON A SIGN MENT TO PICK ONE OF THE TRADITIONAL CARNIVAL MASS CHARACTERS WE JUST LEARNED ABOUT CREATE A COSTUME AND PUT ON A PERFORMANCE IN FRONT OF THE REST OF THE SCHOOL PICKING MY CARTTO WAS A STRUGGLE BUT IN THE END I SETTLED ON THE JAB MOLASSY SOMETIMES CALLED THE BLUE DEVIL IN TRINADAD I PICKED IT MOSTLY BECAUSE I KNEW THE COSTUME WOULD BE ONE OF THE EASIEST TO MAKE AND TIME WAS RUNNING OUT I CUT HOLES INTO AN OLD PARA SHORTS AN A THIN TEACHER I FASHION HORNS FROM PAPER TAWEL ROLLS AND LOOSE STRIPS OF PAPER INTO A CHAIN THAT I COULD WRAP AROUND MY BODY A PICCH FORK I FABRIGATED FROM TREE BRANCHES FROM MY BACK YARD COMPLETED THE LOOK ON THE DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE I CHANGED INTO MY COSTUME IN THE CLASSROOM SMARED MYSELF ALL OVER WITH BLUE PAINT AND THEN HEADED TOWATS THE AUDITORIAN I WAS THE KIND OF CHILD WHO AVOIDED ATTENTION AND EVERYTHING IN ME WAS FIGHTING THE IDEA OF BEING ON STAGE WHEN I STEPPED OUT ALONE IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL MY HEART WAS RACING MY TEACHER TOLD US THAT THE JA MOLASSY WAS A DEMON THAT TERRORIZES A CREATURE BARELY KEPT ON ITS LEASH SO ON THE STAGE THAT DAY I MIGHT HAVE CROUCHED OR JUMPED OR HIS OR BARED MY TEETH AT THE CROWD I'M NOT SURE I JUST REMEMBER MY ANXIETY WASN'T PAINFUL ANY MORE IT WAS EXHILARATING I FELT WICKED AND MASTY AN PLAYFUL AND TRICKIN SO COMPLETELY OUT O CHARACTER AND STILL SO UTTERLY MYSELF DEEPLY INSIDE MY BODY AND YET SOMEHOW FLUWS HAND BOVIT WHEN IT'S GOOD THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO PLAYMAS FOR LONG TIME MASTEN WO FE LIKE MINE I GREW UP IN TRINADAD BUT MY FATHER AND MOTHER ARE FROM JAMAICA AND DIANA RESPECTIVELY CARNIVAL IN THOSE PLACES SIMPLY DOES NOT COMPARE TO THE SPACE THE FESTIVAL TAKES UC AN TRINADAD WHER CARNIVALIS CAME AND ITS INFLUENCE SWIRLS YEAR ROUND EVERYONE MY MOTHER WOULD SAY LAUGHING AS SHAR HER HEAD EVERY ONE FROM THE BIGGEST PARTIA TO THE MOST RELIGIOUS CHURCH MOUTS IS OUT ON THE ROAD COME MONDAYE MY FIMILY DIDN'T GO TO CHURCH REGULARLY BUT THERE WAS NO WAY MY PARENTS REGANA LET ME PARTICIPATE AND CARNIVILL PROPA AS A TEANAGES THAT WAS FOR GROWN PEOPLE WHEN I LEFT TRENADAD FOR COLLEGE IN THE STATES THE LONELINESS TOOK ME BY SURPRISE I WAS EIGHTEEN AND HOMESICKNESS WAS O PHYSICAL AND NEARLY CONSTANT ACHE IT WAS THEN THAT I PLAYED JUVE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT BROOKLYNDS LABOUR DAY PARADE THERE I FINALLY FELT AT HOME AGAIN AND IN THE YEAR SINCE THE PARADE HAS BECOME A SPIRITUAL PRACTIS JUVE ALWAYS BEGINS IN THE DARK THIS  YEAR CLIMB IN UP AND OUT OF THE SUBWAY AT GRAN ARMY PLAZA THE SKY ISN'T QUITE PITCH BLACK BUT IT'S CLOSE AGAINST THE GLEAR OF POLICE FLOOD LIGHTS I CAN JUST MAKE OUT A STREAM OF PEOPLE TRICKLING DOWN THE ROAD IN CLUMPS MY FRIENDS AND I JOIN THE STREAM MOVING TOWARDS THE END WHY P D METAL BARI IS THAT NARROW INTO A CHECK POINT WE ARE PATTED DOWN AN OUR BAGS OPEN I JUVEAS ARRIVED FROM THE FRENCH PURAL WORD FOR DAYBREAT AND TRADITIONALLY BROOKLYN STARTS AS A ROUND FOUR I AM ENDING NOT TOO LONG AFTER THE SUN RISES BUT THIS YEAR THE RISING SUN IS WHAT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE PARADE AT SIX I AM THE PARADE IS STARTING MUCH LATE THAN USUAL THE REASON GIVEN IS THAT IT WOULD HELP CURBE THE VIOLENCE THAT MANY HAVE COME TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE EVENT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A YOUNG LAWYER IN GOVERNOR ANDRUWKOMO'S ADMINISTRATION CARRY GABAY WAS HIT AND KILLED BY A STRABLEET ALONG THE RUT THE NEXT YEAR IT WAS REPORTED THAT FOUR PEOPLE WERE SHOT AT THE PARADE TWO OF WHOM DIED HERE IS WHATS RARELY MENTIONED IN THOSE NUSUAL PORTS THE VIOLENCE THAT BLACK PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IN THESE LONG NEGLECTED NEIGHBOURHOODS HIS YEAR ROUND IT DOESN'T END WHEN THE CAMAS LEAVE THE PARAYE AND IN SOME CASES THE INCIDENTS THAT THE MEDIA OF CONNECTED TO THE PARADE HAPPEN AWAY FROM THE PARADES ACTUAL ROUT THE NEWS COVERAGE JUVE TIPPICY RECEIVES IS FRUSTRATING BUT NOT SURPRISING NO MATTER WHAT PARTS OF THE GLOBE YOUR FRON YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS PART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE BLACK THE THINGS YOU DO TO SECURE JOY FOR YOURSELF IN A WORLD THAT WOULD RATHER SEE YOU DEAD BHE COME THE WAY THE WORLD THEN RATIONALIZES YOUR SUFFERING FOR THE MEDIA FOR EVERY ONE OUTSIDE OF OUR COMMUNITY THE STORY OF THE PARADE IS THE STORY OF THE VIOLENCE THIS IS WHY IT FEELS IMPOSSIBLE TO SMILE BACK WHEN THE OFFICES CHECKING OUR BAGS GRINS IS IF WORE SHARING AN INSIDE JOKE AND COMMENTS JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN BEFORE LETTING US THROUGH ONCE WERE PAST THE CHECK POINT THE CROWD THICKENS IT'S CLEAR THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE THE MORNING IS JUST BEGINNING AND THAT FOR OTHERS A LONG NIGHTS E PARTING IS SIMPLY STRETCHING ITSELF A LITTLEF IT LONGAN EVERY ONE IS DRIFTING CHIPPING OWN THE STREET IN NO REAL HURRY NO ONE IS WEARING ANYTHING THAT WOULDN'T MIND SACRIFICING TO THE JUVA GODS OLD TANKS AND SHORT SHORTS RATY TE SHARITS AND STRAPPY DRESSES THAT RIDE UP THE THI FLAGS ARE EVERYWHERE TIED AROUND WAISTS WORN AS CAPES THE RAD GREEN AND GOLD A GRENADA'S FLAG IN PARTICULAR CAN BE SEEN NEAR AND FOUGHT THE CLOSER WE GET TO THE FRONT OF THE ROUT THE MORE CLEARLY WE CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF WHISTLES AND CONXS UP THE ROAD THE TINNY SOUND AS SOMEBODY BTHING OUT ARE RITHEM ON A SMALL METAL PAN IS JOYING BRIEFLY BY THE HEAVY BEAT OF A COWBAT BOTH ARE SWALLOWED UP BY THE SOUND OF THE STEEL PAN BAN WARMING UP AND THE DEVILS ARE OUT THE GRENADIAN JABJABS ARE COVERED FROM HEAD TO TOW AND SLICK BLACK OIL THE WHITES OF THEIR EYES AND TEETH SEEM TO JUMP OUT TO THEIR SKIN LOCKS AND WAGES AND BRADES ARE WRAPPED UP TIGHTLY IN PLASTIC BAGS SACRIFICE AND OLD CLOTHES IS ONE THING BUT GET ING OIL AND POWDER OUT OF A NEWSOIN IS QUITE ANOTHER THE DEVILS WEAR HARD HATS AND HELMETS CROWNED WITH BLACK HORNS I NARROWLY AVOID GETTING HIT BY ONE OF THE MANY SHOPPING CARTS MANY OF THE DEVILS ARE PUSHING DOWN THE ROAD MOST OF DEM FULL OF PLASTIC BAGS AND BUCKETS AND IN SOME CASES OTHER PASSED OUT DEVILS THE SMELL OF GREAST AND SMOKE ROWS HEAVIER TWO YOUNG DEVILS SPOT MY FRIENDS AND ME AND LOUDLY PROCRAN THAT WE'RE TOO PRETTY ONE OF THE DEVILS DIPS HIS HANDS INTO A BUCKET OF AIL AND THE OTHER BECKONS US CLOSER HE SMILES WIDE AND IT'S BOTH A DAAR AND OR PROMIS AND INVITATION AND O THREATS WE SHAKE OUR HEADS BUT WE'RE ALL LAUGHING AS HE WALKS UP TO US AND STARTS RUBBING US DOWN WITH THE OIL ANYLAY HOU DON'T COME TO JUVE IF WEE NOT PREPARED TO GET TEIR TO YOU HARVANS PULLING ALONG THE RHYTHM SECTION AND EEL PAN BANDS WHO ARE NOW IN FULL SWAY START INCHING DOWN THE ROAD A WOMAN CLIMES ON TOP OF THE BUMPA OF AVAN WHINING HER WAIST SLOWLY IN A SMOOTH RIPPLING MOTION THAT EXTENDS FROM HER SHOULDERS DOWN TO HER LAGS A MAN HAIST THIMSELF UP BEHIND HER AND SHE PICKS UP HE PAKES  WE FLAG DOWN A YOUNG WOMAN SELLING NUT CRACK ES SWEET DRINKS MAKES HEAVILY WITH RUM AND VADGA THE SPITE REPORTS OF A CRACK DOWN ON THE SAILOR WHOSE DRINGS SHE ASK IF SHE CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF US THAT SHE THEN PULSE ON HER INSUGRAND TO PROMOTE HER BUSINESS WE ALL GAGE LIKE WIF KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS AS WE GA  TRYING TO MARK THE MOMENT THE PARADE SLIDES FROM DARKNESS INTO DAYLIGHT IS LIKE TRYING TO TRACT THE RIPENING OF A MANGLE IT HAPPENS SLOWLY AND THEN ALL AT ONCE SUDDENLY I AM SQUINTING INTO THE SUN AND EVERYTHING THAT FELT CLEAR IN THE NIGHT LOOKS AND FEELS STRANGE TO BE NOW THIS IS A PART OF IT TOO WITHIN THIS SPACE WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS A ALLUCINATION MOCO JUMBIS SHORE FOR THE PERFORMES ON SIX FOOT STILTS DRIFT BY LIKE CLOUDS WITHOUT LOOKING DOWN THREE DEVILS COVED AND WHITE PAINT ARE ON THE ROOF OF A NEARBY BUILDING WHINING AND WAVING A HUGE TRINADADE FLAG OVER THE CROWD AS IF CLAIMING TERRITORY HOW DID THEY GET UP THERE I HAVE NO IDEA BUT SOMEHOW IN THE MOMENT THERE'S NOTHING THAT DOESN'T MAKE TEMS JUVE BEGAN AS A WAY TO CELEBRATE SURVIVING THE MOST BRUTAL ASPECTS OF SLAVERY IN JUVE YOU CAN SEE UT OF THE EYES OF THE DEMONS THAT ONE'S DROVY WITH THE WIP YOU CAN EMBODY THE WORST THING THAT EVER HERD YOU AND COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE INVINCIBLE WHEN OUR PEOPLE WERE ENSLAVED THEY WERE DRIVEN INTO BURNING CANE FIELDS TO HARVEST THE LAN THOSE THAT SURVIVED CAME OUT COVERED IN SOOT AND ASH THE HARR DEFIES IMAGINATION BUT AT EVERY TURN WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THAT WE ARE WEAK THAT WE ARE COWARDS THAT WE ARE LESS THAN HUMAN SO WE PLAY JUVETE TO REMEMBER THAT NO ONE HAS THE POWER TO MAKE MONSTERS OF US BUT OURSELVES WE PLAY JUVE AND IN THAT TIME WE BECOME MORE FERSOME THAN ANYTHING THAT COULD EVER TERRORIZE US IN A WORLD THAT ASKD US TO BE QUIETER TO DO LESS TO EXCEPT THE WORST OF EVERYTHING AND TO PRETEND TO LIKE IT JUVE BECOMES THE ALTAR WHERE WE CAN FINALLY FALL TO OUR KNEES AND WORSHIP OURSELFS I AM TOO NOT CRACTICE IN WHEN THE BRASS OF THE RHYTHMSECTION REALLY GETS GOING SOMETHING DEEP AND SWEET SAILS ME THIS YEAR HAS

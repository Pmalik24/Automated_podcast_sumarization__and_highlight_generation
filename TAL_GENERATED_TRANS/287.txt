ASYLMUM SYSTEM AND COMPLETELY CHANGE WHAT IT IS TO BE IN ASYLUM OFFICER HERE'S ALL THE JOB USED TO WORK WHEN A SENTRAL AMERICAN SHOWED UP AT THE UES MEXICO BORDER AND SAID LET ME IN I'M AFRAID OF GOING BACK TO MY COUNTRY THAT'S WHERE THE ASYLUM OFFICER CAME IN THE OFFICER DID SOMETHING CALLED A CREDIBLE FIERE SCREENING TO CHECK IF THE PERSON WAS LIKELY TO FACE HARM OR DEATH IF THE UEST SENT THEM BACK HOME IF THERE'S EVEN A CHANCE THAT THEY WOULD THE ASYLUM OFFICER WOULD LET THEM INTO THE UNITED STATES TO WAIT FOR A QUART DAT WERE AN EMIGRATION JADGE WOULD MAKE THE FINUM CALL DUG STEPHEN SAYS PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HARD THE JOB IS AT THE TIME ALL THIS STARTED HE WAS AN ASYLUM OFFICER AND SEN VASISCO IT'S I'D HAVE PEOPLE COME TO MY OFFISE AND MY JOB TE CENTRAL IS TELL ME THE WORST THING THAT HAVE HAPPEN TO YOU HAVE AN HOUR GO AND THAT ALL THE SIDE IF YOU TELLING ME THE TRUTH AND ALL THE SIDE IF O US STI YOU ARE EXPECTED TO BE WERE WREALLY TO DO THE JOB WELL NEED TO BE AN EXPERT IN THE POLITICAL CULTURAL SOTURAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATIONS IN HE NNUMERABL COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND YOUR EXPECTED TO BE A HUMAN MYDOTECTOR ALL AT ONCE PRESENT TROM TOCK SPOT ASYLUM ITSELF AS IF IT'S FRAD HE SAYS IT'S A HOAX A BIG FAT CONJOB THAT PEOPLE COMEM IN WITH FAKE ASYLUM CLAIMS THAT ASYLUM OFFICERS JUST LET EVERY ONE THROW AND THEN ASYLUM SEEKERS NEVER SHOW UP FOR THEIR DANE ORT THAT IT'S A BORDER WIDE TWO THOUSAND MILE LOOPPOLE AND IT'S TRUE THEN MOST PEOPLE DO PASS THAT FIRST STOP WITH AN ASYLUM OFFICER AND ENTER THE UNITED STATES BUT THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT IT'S BUILTIN DO YOU US ASYLUM LAW A COMMON SENSE HUMANITARIAN IDEA WE DON'T WANT TO SEND PEOPLE BACK TO SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'D GET TORTURED OR KILLED THE LEGAL TERM AS NON REFALUMENT AND SO YOU ES LAW SET THE BAR LAW IF THERE'S BASICALLY ANY CHANCE AND ASYLUM SECRET COULD GET KILLED OR HARMED THE OFFICERS WAS TO LET THEM INTO THE UUS AND DOESN'T NEED A LOT OF PROOF OR EVIDENCE AT THAT POINT LATER WHEN THEY GET BEFORE AN EMIGRATION JUDGE AND BY THE WAY THE MAJORITY DU SHOA THERE THEY NEED PROOF AND MOST OF THEM GET REJECTED EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUM TOOK OFFICE LESS THAN FIFTEEN PER CENT PER YEAR GOT ASYLUM THAT'S BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T MEET THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA IN THE LAW OR DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE OR IT DOESN'T CHECK OUT ALL THE ASYLUM OFFICERS I'VE EVER SPOKEN WITH SEE IT AS THEIR JOB TO WEAD OUT THE FAKERS THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T REALLY NEED PROTECTION THE ONE WHOERE JUST TRING TO GAIN THE SYSTEM OH MY GOD LIKE HERES WHERE I'M GOING TO BE REAL WITH YOU THIS IS AN ASYLUM OFFICER WE'RE CALLING ERSULA THIS ISN'T HER VOICE SHE'S AFRAID OF GETTING FIRED SO WE HAD AN ACT OR COPY WHAT SHE SAID AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE THE FRAD HAP IS LIKE HAPPENING ON A SKALED THATS THAT'S HUGE WE'RE TALKING LIKE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AMONTH I INTERVIEWED THREE ASYLUM OFFICERS FOR THIS STORY AND ALL THREE SAID THE GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY TARGET OF PRESIDENT TRUMPS EMIGRATION POLICIES THEY ACTUALLY AREN'T THE MAIN ONES COMMITTING FRAUD IT'S NOT THE CENTRAL AMERICANS IT'S NOT THE MIDDALEASTERN PEOPLE IT IS THE INDIAN PEOPLE AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME BULLSHIT'S STORY ABOUT GETTING BEATEN WITH HOCKEY STICKS THREE TIMES BECAUSE THEIR PART OF IS SEEK PARTY AND THE POLICE TOLD THEM THEY'RE GOING TO JAIL THEM IF THEY EVER BADMOUTH THE RULING PARTY EVER AGAIN BULLSHIT JUST HAP THEY ALL JUST HAPPENED TO DO THE SAME THING AND SUFFER THE SAME FATE EVEN THOUGH THEREIS ABSOLUTELY NO CONFIRMATION IN ANY MEDIA THAT ANY OF THIS PERSECUTION IS HAPPENING AND STUDY'S DONE BY OUR OUR DEPARTMENT OF STATE A COUNTER PARTS IN THE COUNTRY ARE STRAIGHT UP LIKE THIS IS NOT A REAL THING THE CHINESE ARE RUNNING AS SIMILAR SCAM WITH CHRISTIAN CLAIMS IN THE FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ASYLUM OFFICERS STARTED HEARING ABOUT THESE BIG CHANGES COMING THE POLICY THAT WAS FIRST CALLED REMAIN IN MEXICO AND THEN LATER MIGAN PROTECTION PROTOCALS M P P BUT THE ASYLUM OFFICERS WHO WERE GOING TO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS THING THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THE DETAILS OF HOW THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IT IT WAS ALL SHROUDED AND SO MUCH SECRECY THIS IS ANOTHER ASYLUM OFFICER WE'RE CALLING HER ANN WE USED AN ACTOR HERE TOO TO PROTECT HER IDENTITY OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS ANN STARTS PICKING UP AROUND THE OFFICE THAT SOME OF HER COLLEAGUES WERE BEEN CALLED IN QUIETLY AND ASK TO GO TO THE BORDER IN SANDIAGO AND INSTEAD OF THE CREDIBLE FEAR SCREENINGS THEY'D ALWAYS DONE THEY SEEMD TO BE DOING SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT UNDER M P P A WHOLE NEW KIND OF INTERVIEW WITH DIFFERENT RULES SHE KNEW SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO START DOING THEM TOO SO SHE PULLED ASIDE A CO WORKER WHO'D ALREADY BEEN SENT TO THE BORDER I WAS ASKING HER AY LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TRAINING LIKE WHAT IS THIS AND SHE WAS LIKE I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO ABOUT IT ANOTHER ASYLUM OF JA IS THONE WHO YOUD LIKE CONSIDER A FRIEND ORE JA SORTER LIKE PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUE GOOD COLLEAGUE GOOD COLLEAGUE SOME ONE THAT WE HAD MUTUAL TRUST FOR SURE AND THEN WAS TOLD WAS BROUGHT IN BY A SUPERVISER FOR LIKE A SPECIAL BRIEF ABOUT ABOUT IT BEFORE I WAS GOING TO START DOING THESE INTE RVIEWS AND WAS TOLD HERE'S THE SKINNY ON IT AND DON'T TELL ANY ONE WHY BECAUSE I THINK THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS LEGALLY DUBIOS AND SUSPECT AND THEY WANTED TO KEEP TTHE THE LEAK TO MINOUM THE LEAK BEING A MAJOR POLICY ROLL UT THAT WAS CAN A CHANGE ASYLUM EH THAT'S THE L THAT'S THE LEAK YET TWO MONTHS GO BY BEFORE THEY DO A FORMAL TRAINING SESSION WITH THE FULL ASYLUM CORN ND IT'S JUST A POWER POINT HERE'S OUR SOLA AGAIN HANDS WERE GOING UP AND BEING LIKE WE HOW IS THIS LEGAL OR HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE DOING THIS AND HOW DO WE KNOW HOW THIS WORKS ALL THREE OF THE ASYLUM OFFICERS I TALK TO SAID THAT THE PRESENTATION LEFT THEM WITH LOTS OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING THE BIGGEST ONE HOW WAS THIS LEGAL THESE OFFICERS KNEW BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY ONE HOW DANGEROUS MEXICO IS AND AS POLICY SEEMED DESIGNE TO SEND TUNS OF PEOPLE BACK TO MEXICO IT SEEMED TO BE IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION WITH YOU AS ASYLUM LAW WHICH SAYS THAT AT THE VERY LEAST WE CAN'T SEND PEOPLE BACK TO A SITUATION WHERE THEY'D GET HARMED OR KILLED WE CAN'T VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLE OF NON REFALMENT AND THE RESPONSE WAS LIKE I'M JUST THE MESSENGER BRINGING THIS DOWN FROM H KE AND THIS IS THE POWER POINT THEY GAVE US I WAS LIKE WELL IF YOU DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT DOUBLE CHECKING THAT THIS IS LEGAL AND YOU'RE JUST THE MESSENGER AS YOU SAY YOU'RE A FACANASS HAL YOU KNOW ALL THREE OFFICERS SAY THEY RAISED S CONCERNS AND GOT ROUGHLY THE SAME RESPONSE JUST GET OUT THERE AND DO YOUR JOB BUT THEY FOUND OUT SOON ENOUGH WAS JUST HOW RADICAL A CHANGE THE NEW M P P INTERVIEWS WERE FROM THE OLD CREDIBLE FIER SCREENINGS FOR STARTERS NOT EVERYONE WOULD GET AN INTERVIEW ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTEERED THAT THEY WERE SCARED TO GO BACK TO MEXICO WOULD IF THEY GOT AN INTERVIEW UNDER M P P ASYLUM SEKERS WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY'D BE HARMED IN MEXICO NOT THEIR HOME COUNTRY AN NOT JUST ANY HARM THEY CAN'T JUST BE THREATENED BY GANGS OR THE POLICE THEY HAVE TO BE THREATENED BY GANGS OR POLICE OR WHOEVER BE CAUSE OF SOME VERY SPECIFIC REASONS LAID OUT IN YOU AS LAW BECAUSE OF THEIR NATIONALITY RACE RELIGION POLITICS OR BEING PART OF A PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP LIKE I'LL GE B D KU AND THEY'D HAVE TO SHOW THAT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT LIKE A COP OR AN OFFICIAL WAS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROTECT THEM AND THE ASYLUM SEEKER COULDN'T JUST SAY ALL THIS HAPPEN LIKE THEY COULD UNDER CREDIBLE FIER SCREEINGS NOW THEY NEED TO PROVE IT IT'S LIKE AS ASYLUM SEEKERS WERE TRAVELLING THROUGH MEXICO FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GATHERING EVIDENCE OF ALL THE SCREWED UP THINGS HAPPENING TO THEM THERE MAKING A PAPER TRAIL AND THEY SHOUD HAVE HAD ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE ON THEM RIGHT THEN RIGHT AFTER CROSSING THE BORDER WHICH OF COURSE IS NEXT IMPOSSIBLE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY HAD NO IDEA ANY OF THIS WAS REQUIRED DUGS AWALL THIS HAPPENING AND WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH IT S WE TRIED TO KEEP HIS HEAD DOWN TO TRY AND AVOID HAVING TO DO THESE INTERVIEWS HOPING THE COURTS WOULD KILL M P P BUT THEY DIDN'T BY JUNE M P P RETURNS HAT SKY ROCKETED AND IT WAS ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR THE ASYLUM COR DUG COULDN'T DODGE IT ANYMORE AND I DON'T BE NOW IT SAID YOU'RE DOING M P P INTERVIEWS TOY SO I HEARD U FATHER AND SON SONITHINK WAS PRETANES ELEVENR TWELVE THE FLNG OM UNDERUS BEC CAUSE O VIOLUNCE ANOTHER PROBLEMS DIDN'T PALK ABOUT THAUT MUCH CAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPUTY AN  FOKEST ONLY IN WHY THEY'R AFRAID TO GO BACK TO MEXICO OF COURSE THE GUY AND HIS SON DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR EVEN TALKING ABOUT MEXICO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IS AT ALL THE INTERVIEW CONTINUED SO SHE HAD TRIED TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE THERE HAD TRIED TO GE A WORK PERMITEN MEXICO AND WAS A SENTUALLY DEMIED AND AS HER CANSINGS TALKING ABOUT YOURE ENCOUNTERING CAR TELLS AND WITNESS SAYING OTHER MYGRANCS BEING MURDERED TORTURED IN FRONT OF I SON AND FLEEING AND BURLID ENTING AWAY YOU KNOW WALL THAT ATS ER BING SHT AND YOU KNOW TI HIM OUT HIS SON HAVING MIHTNERS FOR WEEKS BECAUSE OF IS AND THEN BE GET STOP BY THE POLACE AND HE PLEASE TAKE ALL THEIR MONEY HERSELFANS

WOEULD PUT THEM IN A PROTECTED CATEGORY THEY WERE TARGETED BECAUSE OF THEIR NATIONALITY THOUGH EVEN IF THE FATHER HAD SAID BECAUSE I'M HUNDER AND THEY PROBABLY STILL WOUL HAVE BEEN SENT BACK TO MEXICO BECAUSE ODDS ARE HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE PROVING THAT ANY OF THIS HAPPENED DUG HE DID WHAT THE PAUS HE TOLD HIM TO DO HE SENT THEM BACK TO MEXICO THE OLD CREDIBLE FIER SCRANINGS USUALLY TOOK AN HOUR OR LESS THESE EMPY P INTERVIEWS CAN LAST FOUR FIVE SIX HOURS WHEN I ASK THESE ASYLUM OFFICERS TO DESCRIBE WHAT THESE INTERVIEWS ARE LIKE FOR THEM FOR THE MIGENTS IN FRONT OF THEM ERSALI GAVE THE MOST FITHED PICTURE SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE VERY FIRST ENP P INTERVIEW SHE DID A FAMILY FROM ALS ALVADOR TWO PARENTS IN TWO KIDS SHE HAD A SCRIPT SHE HAD TO STICK TO THE FAMILY WAS EXHAUSTED AND TROMATIZED AND TOTALLY UNPREPARED YOUR PUT INTO A CELL YOU'RE SEPARATED FROM YOUR KIDS AND YOUR WIFE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT TO DAY YOU WERE GOING TO BE INTERVIEWED ABOUT AL SALVADOR AND YOU WERE GOING TO GET TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES COUPLE HOURS LATER THEY LEAD YOU INTO THIS FREESING COLD CELL WHERE THEY CHAN YOUR HANDS TO A TABLE IN HANDCUFFS AND SOME ONE IS SITTING ACROSS FROM YOU WHO DOESN'T SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE AND STARTS TALKING TO SOME ONE IN THE PHONE WHO STARTS TRANSLATING TO YOU THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MEXICO YOU SMELL LIKE SHIT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LIVING IN A SHELTER YOU KNOW WITHOUT ANY RUNNING WATER FOR A MONTH AND A HALF BUSS YOU'VE TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY ACROSS CENTRAL AMERICA TO GET THERE AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE'S TALKING TO YOU ABOUT MEXICO THIS INTERVIEW GOES ON FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF AND THE PERSON KEEPS PAUSING IT SO THEY CAN TALK TO SOME ONE ON THE COMPUTER WHICH THEY SAY IS THEIR SUPERVISER AND NOTHERGARD LEADS YOUR WIFE AN THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN THE LAST TWELVE HOURS INTO THE INTERVIEW ROOM AND YOU CAN YOU KNOW BRUSH HER HAND AS SHE PASSES BY YOUR SO HAPPY TO SEE HER BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SEPARATED YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON SO WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN I DON'T KNOW SIR I'M SURE THEY'LL BE FINE YOUR WIFE GOES THROUGH A SIMILAR INTERVIEOU OM BUT SHE KEEPS BEING CONFRONTED ABOUT THE ANSWER SHE'S GIVING BECAUSE THEI'R DIFFERENT FROM YOURS AND THE OFFICER CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS STORY VERYS SO DIFFERENTLY BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED ID HALF AN HOUR PASSES BEFORE HER CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM AND THEN THE OFFICER HAS TO TALK TO A TEN YEAR OLD BOY ABOUT WHATEVER HIS PARENTS SAID AND THEN CONFRONT TH HE TEN YEAR OLD BOY ON INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN HIS STORY AND HIS PARENTS STORY AND THEN THE WIFE IS LIKE WHEN AM I GOING TO SEE MY HUSBAND AGAIN NTHE OFFICERS LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA LET THEM KNOW IF YOU NEED TO USE THE BATHROO URSULA MADE THE CASE THAT THE FAMILY SHOULDN'T GET SENT BACX TO MEXICO AND TO HER SHOCK HER SUPERVISOR AGREE IN FACT SHE HAPPENED TO WALK OUTSIDE THE MOMENT THE FAMILY GOT RELEASED THEY'VE GOT THEIR BACK PACKS ON THEIR HOLDING HANDS SHE THOUGHT MAYBE THIS WON'T BE SO BAD BUT THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE VERY NEXT INTERVIEW A WOMAN TOLD HER OVER AND OVER SHE WAS AFRAID OF BEING RAPED AND KILLED IN MEXICO URSULA BELIEVED SHE WAS GOING BACK TO A PLACE HER THAT WAS VERY POSSIBL BUT BECAUSE THE WOMAN COULDN'T NAME A SPECIFIC PERSON WHO'D ASSAULT HER URSULA HAD TO SEND HER BACK SINCE THEN IT'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN KNO AFTER KNO AFTER KNO ASYLUM OFFICERS TOLD ME THAT EVEN WHEN THEY FIND ONE OF THOSE UNICORN CASES WER THEY CHECK OFF ALL THE BOXES AND RECOMMEND NOT RETURNING TO MEXICO THEIR SUPERVISORS OVERRULE THEM ANN TOLD ME AND MI PRODUCER NAUTYA RAYMON ABOUT ONE ASYLUM SECRE'S CASE WERE THEIR ATTACKER EVEN SPELLED OUT THEIR MOTIVE AND IT STILL DIDN'T FLY IT WAS BASICALLY A SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS A REALLY CLEAR CONNECTION TO THE NATIONALITY LIKE THE PERSECUTOR HEAD LIKE REALLY SAID LIKE I AM HARMING YOU BECAUSE OF THIS NATIONALITY YOURE NATIONALITY AND THE HARM WAS REALLY REALLY SEVERE IT WAS LY DEFINITELY TORTURE AND OH IT WAS REALLY CLEAR THAT THE POLICE LIKE WEREN'T GOINGTO DO A THING ABOUT IT DIDN'T CARE AT ALL AND THE SUPERVISOR REJECTED IT WHY LYDE THE SAY WY THEY SAID AH WE CAN'T SHOW THAT IF THIS INDIVIDUAL WENT BACK TO MEXICO THE PERSECUTOR WOULD BE ABLE TO LOCATE THEM SO THE STANDARD TO DAYS UPSIDE DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE INECREDIBLE FEAR INSTEAD OF LET'S ERE ON THE SIDE OF LETTING PEOPLE IN BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANY

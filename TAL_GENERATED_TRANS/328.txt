LADIES IN THE HOUSE WHERE A LOT NIC THIS A TAY DEFENCE FILE IT SIR BAT A COPY MARGARET HAD ALSO TRACK DOWN THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF WILLIAM WALTER'S LAWYER WHO HAD SAVED IN A CLOSET THE COMPLETE DEFENCE FILE FROM THE KIDNAPPING CASE WHEN MARGARET HEARD THAT SHE DROPPED EVERYTHING BOUGHT A PORTABLE SCANNER AND SHOWED UP AT THE WOMAN'S DOORSTEP SHE SPEND A WEEK SCANNING THE ENTIRE THING AND THEN FOUR MONTHS BACK AT HOME TIPING AND DECIPHERING IT THE DEFENCEFILE WAS A GOLD MINE IT HAD CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE GOVERNORS OF MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA HAND WRITTEN LETTERS FROM JULIA ANDERSON AND DOZENS OF SWORN AFFIDAVIDS FROM MISSISSIPPI RESIDEN'S SAYING THAT THE CHILD WAS BRUCE ANDERSON AND THAT THEY'D SEEN HIM IN THE AREA WITH WALTERS MONTHS BEFORE BOBBY DUNBAR WENT MISSING AND THEN THERE WAS THIS LETTER WRITTEN BY WILLIAM WALTER'S HIMSELF JUST DAYS AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED AND THROWN IN JAIL A DRES DIRECTLY TO PERCY DUNBAR WHO HAD JUST TAKEN THE BOY HOME WITH HIM I SEE THAT YOU GOT BRUCE BUT YOU HAVE HEAPED UP TROUBLE FOR YOURSELVES I HAD NO CHANCE TO PROVE UP BUT I KNOW BY NOW YOU HAVE DECIDED YOU ARE WRONG IT IS VERY LIKELY I WILL LOSE MY LIFE ON ACCOUNT OF THAT AND IF I DO THE GREAT GOD WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE  THAT BOY'S MOTHER IS JULIA ANDERSON YOU ASK HIM AND HE WILL TELL YOU I DID NOT TEACH HIM TO BAG OR BOM BUT INASMUCH AS YOU HAVE HIM TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM SO YOU HAVE A LOST ROBERT AND ME A LOST BRUCE MAY GOD BLESS MY DARLING BOY WRITE ME IF I DON'T GET LYNCHD I THINK YOU WILL BE SAD A LONG TIME BUT HOPE NOT TOO BAD THE DEFENCEFILE WAS FOUR HUNDRED PAGES OF EVIDENCE THAT DIRECTLY CHALLENGED MARGARET'S FAMILY LEDGEND AND PRETTY SOON MARGARET REACHED A BREAKING POINT T TOWARD THE VERY END OF OF ME TIPING THE DEFENCE FILE WHICH WAS NOT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER I'M I CAME ACROSS THE LATTER AT THAT TOTALLY AH IT WAS MY PEFFANY IT WAS THE LETTER WRITTEN BY A CHRISTIAN WOMAN I DONT EVEN A HAR NAME SHE JUST SIGNED IT A CHRISTIAN WOMAN AN IT WAS THREATEN TO THE ATTARNEYIS OF WILLIAM WALL TARS AN IT SAS IM KINDLY PARDON MA I AM ELL AN BAD BUT THIS MATTER HAS JUST WORAYED ME DEAR SIR IN VIEW OF HUMAN JUSTICE TO JULIA ANDERSON AND MOTHERS I AM PROMPTED TO WRITE TO YOU I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT DUNBARS HAVE BREE ANDERSON AND NOT THEIR BOY IF THIS IS THEIR CHILD WHY ARE THEY AFRAID FOR ANY ONE TO SEE OR INTERVIEW HIM PRIVATELY I WOULD SEE NOTHING TO FEAR AND THIS SEEMS STRANGE THE DUNBAR'S CLAIMED THAT THE LETTER GOES ON FOR SIX PAGES LAYING OUT A POINT BY POINT COMMON SENSE ARGUMENT THAT THE DUNBARS HAVE THE WRONG CHILD WHY HAVEN'T PICTURES OF BOBBY AND BRUCE BEEN PRINTED SIDE BY SIDE SO THE WORLD COULD SEE WHETHER THEY LOOK LIKE OR NOT WHY IS JULIA JUDGE MORE HARSHLY FOR WAVERING THAN LESSIE WHEN NEITHER OF THEM RECOGNIZED THE CHILD AT FIRST WHICH GETS A CHRISTIAN WOMAN TO HER BIGGEST POINT  A LOOK BACK AT THAT FATEFUL NIGHT IN MISSISSIPPI WHEN THE DUNBAR'S FIRST SAW THE BOY AND DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM UNTIL LESSIE GAVE HIM A BATH AND SAW HIS MOLES AND SCARS IF THIS HAD BEEN THEIR OWN CHILD AND HE HAD BEEN GONE EIGHT MONTHS TO YOU THINK HIS FEAKTURES WOULD BE SO CHANGED THAT THEY WOULD NOT KNOW HIM ONLY BY MOLES AND SCARS THIS IS A FARCE IF THE DUNBAR'S DO NOT KNOW THEIR CHILD WHO HAS ONLY BEEN GONE EIGHT MONTHS BY HIS FETURES WHY THEY DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL BREASAN BY REASON BY RESON THIS WOMAN IS GIVING ME EVERY AND SHE APPARENTLY FOLLOWD THIS VERY CLOSELY IN THE NASE PAPARS AND IT JUST SIMPLY DONED ON MAY OH MY GON SHE'S WRIHT THIS  WHAT A FARCE WHAT A FARCE THIS IS   THE IDEA FOR A DEONA TEST HAD BEEN FLOATING AROUND FOR YEARS BUT MARGARET HADN'T WANTED TO DO IT UNLESS ALL HER UNCLES AND AUNTS BOBBY DUNBAR'S CHILDREN AGREED TO IT AND THEN FOUR YEARS INTO A RESEARCH A REPORTER FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ALLAN BREED GOT WIND OF THE STORY MARGARET REMEMBERS BEING IN THE ROOM WHEN ELLEN ASKED HER FATHER IF HE WOULD CONSENT TO A DEONATEST SHE WAS STARTLED AT HIS ANSWER YES HE SAID HE WANTED TO DO IT NOW HED WAITED LONG ENOUGH MARGARET'S FATHER BOB DUNBAR JUNIOR WAS BOBBY DUNBAR'S OLDEST SON HE'D HEARD THE LEGEND OF COURSE BUT HED NEVER HEARD IT FROM HIS FATHER IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DISCUSSEAT HOME IT WAS JUST THE THE STUFF WAS IN THE ADDI NEWSPAPER ARTICLES SOME PICTURES IT WAS SUFF THAT MY MOTHER GATHERED IN AT HOME WE NEVER DISCUSSTD BUT BOBBY HAD BEEN WATCHING MARGARET'S RESEARCH WITH INTEREST REMEMBER HE'D GIVEN HER THE SCRAPBOOK THAT GOT THIS WHOLE THING STARTED BOBBY HAD JUST SPENT WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH CONGESTIVE HEARTFAILURE AND EXPLAINED HIS DECISION THIS WAY IN A LETTER TO HIS FAMILY DADDY DID NOT HAVE THE SCIENCE OF DEONAE TO CONFIRM THE DECISION OF THE COURT IN HIS YOUTH I FEEL IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO ACHIEVE THAT BEFORE I GO THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THE TEST WOULD BE TO COMPARE THE DEONAE OF TWO DIFFERENT LINES OF DUNBARS SOME ONE FROM BOBBY'S LINE SINCE HIS IDENTITY WAS IN DOUBT AND SOME ONE FROM HIS BROTHER OLNZO'S LINE SINCE THERE WAS NO QUESTION HE WAS AT DUNBAR BOBBYD MARGARET SPOKE WITH ELONJO'S SON DAVID AND HE AGREED TO DO THE TEST THE PLAN WAS TO KEEP THE RESULT SEALED UNTIL ALL BOB SIBBLINGS AGREED TO OPEN THEM A MONTH PAST I CALM TO CHACK WITH THE LABORATORY AND THE LABORATORY ASSISTANT I'M AND DI NOT BLARDING TO MAY THE RESULTS ON THE OVER THE FAN THE DEANAY DID NOT MATCH YEN AS FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED IT WAS A PATERNITY TEST YOU NOW IM SHE HAD NO IDEA

CHILDREN  HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT WELCOME AN EMBRACE MA INTO THEIR LIVES AND THEY THINK THAT I'M BRAVE AND SMART AND WILLIAM WALTERS FAMILY THINKS THAT I'M A WIS I THINK FROM MY FAMILY WHEN I STARTED THIS PROJECT I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOOD SORT OF KEEP BU BONDED AND IT DIDN'T IT CET IT IT DIVIDED SO AN AWAY I FEET LIKE FAILURE THERE ARE PEOPLE UPSET BY IT AND ON THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO STILD ON EXCEPT THAT THE TRUTH IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME THEY DON'T THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME THE DISAPPEARANCE OF BOBBY DUNBAR BLEW APART THE LIVES OF THRE DIFFERENT FAMILIES BUT THE PEOPLE YOU'D THINK WOULD BE HERT THE WORST BIIT ACTUALLY COME OUT THE BEST LIKE JULIA ANDERSON BEFORE BOBBY'S DISAPPEARANCE SHE WAS A FIELD HAND IN NORTH CAROLINA ON HER OWN NOT MAKING ENOUGH MONEY TO FEED HER OWN CHIALD THE PEOPLE SHE WORKED FOR MIS TREATED HER THE MAN SHE MARRIED SHOT HER IN THE FOOT THE NIGHT AFTER HER WEDDING BUT WILLIAM WALTERS KINNEPPING TRIAL GOT HER OUT OF THERE TO A BETTER PLACE POPLARVILLE MISSISSIPPI BACK AN NINETEEN TWELVE IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN WILLIAM WALTERS AND JULIA' SON BRUCE HAD BEEN WELL KNOWN FIXTURES IN THE BOPLAR VILAREA HE AN BRUCE STAYED IN PEOPLE'S HOMES FOR WEEKS AT A TIME WHILE HE TUNED PIANOS AND REPAIRED THE CHURCH ORGAN AND WHEN WILLIAM WALTER WENT TO TRIAL THESE VERY PEOPLE AT LEAST TWENTY OF THEM CAME FORWARD TO TESTIFY TO HIS INNOCENCE AND THAT'S WHERE THEY MET JULIA THE MOTHER OF THE CHILD THEY'D KNOWN AND CARED FOR WHO WAS ALSO THERE TO TESTIFY FOR WALTERS AFTER THE TRIAL JULIA HAD NO MONEY AND NO PLACE TO GO THE PEOPLE FOR MISSISSIPPI TOOK HER IN IT WAS ALMOST LIKE SHE WAS ADOPTED JUST LIKE BRUCE WAS TAKEN IN TO BE BOBBY AND BOTH ON WERE GIVEN A NEW LIFE I MEAN THAY EVERYTHING THAT BAD COULD BE SAID ABOUT SOMEBODY WAS SAD ABOUT JULIE AT THIS TRIAL YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE SAID WAS SAY T BUT THESE PEOPLE SAUL SOMETHING IN HER IT THEY WOULDN'T AVE TAKEN HER IN HER HOME AND THERE HON'T YEL THE PEOPLE HERE IN BAPABILLE OUT OF FORCE GREAT THEY COULD HAVE LEFT HER N O POLISS ECOND LEFT HER IN NEW ORLEANS BUT THEY BROUGHT HER HOME WI THING SHE LOST EVERYTHING SHE LOST SHE HAD A BABY THAT DIED JUST BEFORE SHE CAME DOWN HERE YOU KNOW AND OW SHE'S LOST BRUCE WHAT DID SHE HAVE TO LIVE FOR WHY DIDN'T SHE YOU KNOW SUICIDE WAS NOT OF UNHEART OF YOU KNOW I'M SURE THEY DIDN' PROMISE HER THAT JUS SAID COME HOME WITH US YOU KNOW COME HOME WITH US TO YOU GET ON YOUR HEET COME HOME WITH US THINKIN CAN GET UP AND DO FOR YOURSELVE SO I CAN'T REGRET IT I CANNOT REGRET FOR ONE MENUTE THAT SHE CAME DOWN ROUND SAD THAT THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE THAT CHILD AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD EVER MADE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY SAY IN O CAT WILD GIVE YOU A NEW LIFE IF YOU GIVE US THIS CHILD SHE HAD HAVE NEVER GIVEN THAT CHILD A I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BUT IF YOU HATE THAT IT HAPPENED THEN YOU HATE THAT YOU ARE IF THAT MATES ANY SANCE AND I DON'T HATE THAT I AM I'M I REJOICING THAT I AM I REJOICE IN THE FAMILY THAT THAT WE'VE GOT AND I FEEL LIKE GRANDMOTHER FELT THE SAME WAY AS FOR THE CONSEQUENCES FOR BOBBY EVEN JULI ANDERSON'S CHILDREN OLLISON JEWEL FIGURE HE WAS PROBBLY BETTER OFF WITH THE DUNBARS I DON'T WANT TO PUTYT HIM DOWN O MY MOTHER DOWN EITHER YOU KNOW WHAT I ME SHE DID BEST SHE COULD WIT WHAT PROBBY SHE HAD TO DO WIVH THE YEARSOME PEOPLE IT HE GOT ALL THE WAGON TO GET IN A CAR THOME AND CLOSED HER THE DIVORCE PAPERS I PROMISED SO I KNOW THAT THESE HER OFFICIAL CROPIES BECAUSE THE NOTARY SALS ARE RAISED THE DIVORCE PAPERS OF ERCY UN LESS IE DUNBAR A BRIEF BUT EVEN THE BAREFACTOR ENOUGH TO IMAGINE WHAT LIFE IN THE DUNBAR FAMILY WAS LIKE FOR BOBBY AFTER THE TRIAL WAS QUITE LESSIE AND PERCY SEPARATED IN NINETEEN TWENTY MEANING FIVE YEARS AFTER THE COURT AFFIRMED THAT BOBBY WAS HERS LESSIE LEFT HIM HER HUSBAND AND HER OTHER SENT ALONZO BEHIND AND MOVED TO NEW ORLEANS BOBBY WAS TWELVE AND ALONZO WAS TEN ALSO IN NINETEEN TWENTY PERCY BEAT AND STABBED A MAN WHILE ON A TRIP TO FLORIDA ON THE EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY OF BOBBY'S DISAPPEARANCE IT'S COURT RECORD FOR THIS ASSAULT IS INCLUDED IN THE DIVORCE PAPERS LESSIE MAKES ACCUSATIONS OF REPEATED IN ONGOING IN FIDELITY BUT PERCY DENIES THE CHARGES ELSEWHERE THERE IS ANOTHER COURT RECORD THAT CORROBORATES LESSIE'S CLAIM IT'S IN A REST RECORD FOR PERCY ON CHARGES OF A DULTERY IN COHABITATION BUT PERHAPS THE MOST COMPELLING DETAIL AS A HANDWRITTEN NOTE THAT ACCOMPANY'S THE PACKET IT'S FROM LESSIE HERSELF TO ELIZABETH HER GRANDDAUGHTER WHO TOOK CARE OF HER IN HER OLD AGE THIS SAS FOR ELIZABETH DUNBAR T TO READ AFTER MY DEATH SO SHE MAY KNOW WHY I STAYED IN MY SHALL OF GRAFE SHET STAYED IT HERSHELL AGRIEF I THINK SHE HAD TO HIVE ON SOME LEVEL KNOWN AND MAYBE SHE DIDN'T I DON'T KNOW I THINK MAYBE SHE WAS IN A DENIAL AR ENTIRE LIE I FROM EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD SHE TRULY BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS HER SON BOBBY BUT I CAN'T HELP IT BUT WONDER THAT MAYBE UNDERNEATH WHERE YOU GO AND CAN'T TALK ABOUT SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS WAS NOT HER SON THAT SHE BIRTH AND THIS IS PROBABLY AT THE HEART OF THE DUNBAR FAMILY'S UNHAPPINESS WITH THIS STORY WHAT IT SUGGESTS ABOUT THEIR ANCESTORS AND THEIR ANCESTORS MOTIVES AND CHARACTERS IT'S LIKELY TO ME THAT PERCY MUST HAVE KNOWN SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF HIM THAT THIS LITTLE BOY HE TOOK FROM MISSISSIPPI WAS NOT HIS SIN AND I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY IT TOOK ME IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION I'M AFTER READING ALL OF THE ARTICLES AND THE COURT RECORDS I'M THES DIVORCE PAPERS I REALIZED THAT IF HE WAS CAPABLE OF DOING THESE THINGS IF PERCY WAS CAPABLE IF HE COULD STAB A MAN IF HE COULD BE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WHILE HE WAS MARRIED E NAW HE LIES IN THIS PA PERCY E IM COULD HE LIE ABOUT THIS CHILD DID HE LIE ABOUT THIS CHILD HE HAD A MOTIVE TO SAVE HIS LIFE'S SANITY COULD HE DI THAT I THINK HE COULD I THINK HE DID IT CHARGED TO LOOK SQUARE IN THE FACE OF THIS AND DOING SO HAS PUT MARGARET IN HER FATHER BOB AT ODDS WITH THE REST OF THEIR FAMILY BUT BOB SAYS ONLY BY LOOKING AT IT SQUARELY CAN YOU SEE THE RE DEMPTION IN THEIR FAMILY STORY WHEN BOBBY DUNBAR WAS EIGHTEEN HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HA GIRL FROM NEARBY TOWN IT TOOK HIM NINE YEARS TO GET HER TO MARRY HIM BUT WHENT SHE DID THEY RAISED FOUR CHILDREN WHO ALL REMEMBER VERY HAPPY UPBRINGING FULL OF LOVE AND BOBBY DUNBAR GAVE RISE TO THIS FAMILY DESPITE ALL THAT HEHAD BEEN THROUGH WHISKED AWAY FROM HIS MOTHER AT THREE LIVING IN A WAGON WITH AN OLD MAN HUDDLING BY FIRES IN THE WOODS AT NIGHT A TWO YEAR LONG GAUNTMET OF UNDRESSING AND PARADING AND SOBBING AND STARING AND WHEN THAT WAS ALL OVER HIS NEW FAMILY FRACTURED AND FELL APART AND ONCE AGAIN HE WAS ABANDONED TO COME OUT OF THAT TO CREATE A FAMILY AFTER THAT TO BOB IS A STORY OF TRIUMPH I FEEU LIKE MY DADY GOULD HAVE HAD ALL EXCUSES IN THE WORLD TO BE A DRUNK IN OM CHILD A BUS YERAR ANYTHING A RASCAL HE HAD A TERRIBLE TRAMATTY YOUNG LIFE BUT HE CHOSE MY MOTHER AND HE CHOSE TO BE A FAMILY MAN THAT WAS HIS WORLD THAT WITH HIS LIFE AND I ASSURLYLIEVE THAT THOSE EXPERIENCES FOR HEN AND FOR MOTHER WHO LOST O A FATHER BEFORE SHE EVEN KNEW HIM WHA FORCEES DID GRAVITATED THEM TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER AND TOWARDS A COMMON FEELING THAT YNOW THEY WOULD BE FAM I REALIZE TAT I GREW UP IN IT CHAMED AND VAMILY AND EVERYBODY CAN'T SAY THAT AND THAT COULDN'T SAY THAT BUT HE MADE THAT ADVIMENT FOR US ATS WAZY LAKE THERE NOW HOUSES WERE FISHING CHACKS USED TO BE MARGARET STANDING ON THE CONGRY BRIDGE THAT REPLACED THE RAILROAD TRESTLE LOOKING OUT ON THE EMBANKMENT WHERE THEY FOUND THE FOUR YEAR OLD FOOTPRINTS IN NINETEEN TWELVE AFTER CONSIDERING WHAT BOBBY DUNBARS TIS APPEARANCE DID TO EVERYONE IN THREE FAMILIES FOR A HUNDRED YEARS THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON WHO'S NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IF BOBBY WAS REALLY BRUCE WHAT HAPPENED TO BOBBY I THINK HE FELL OFF THIS BREDGE AND WAS ETIN BON ALLE GATER AND DIED THAT'S THE MICE LIKELY SENARY I WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHO THE BOY THAT DIED HERE TO THAT PEELIKE YOUR GRANDFATHER IT'S LIKE MY GRANDFATHER BECAME TWO PEOPLE HE WAS FAIRLY BRUCE ANDERSON THATS WHO HE WAS BORN THAT'S WHERE HIS BLOOD CAME FROM THAT HE LIVED BOBBY DUNBAR'S LIFE IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO WHEN BOBBY DUNBAR WAS TWENTY FOUR HE WAS ASKED TO LOOK BACK ON HIS KIDNAPPING THE LINBURG BABY HAD BEEN STOLEN AND SOME REPORTERS CAME AROUND FOR A WORD WITH THE FAMOUS KIDNAPPED CHILD OF YESTER YEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE I WAS EATEN BY AN ALLIGATOR BOBBY SAID IN THE INTERVIEW I CAN ASSURE YOU I WAS NOT HE WENT ON TO RECOUNT A MEMORY OF BEING WITH WILLIAM WALTERS ON THE WAGON ON THE ROAD BEFORE THE ARREST BEFORE HE WAS RECOVERED BY THE DUNBARS IN THE MEMORY THERE WAS ANOTHER BOY WITH HIM WHO FELL OFF THE WAGON AND DIED AND WAS BURIED THERE WAS A THEORY PUT FORTH BY THE PROSECUTION AT THE TRIAL THAT WILLIAM WALTERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING WITH TWO BOYS BOBBY DUNBAR ANBREWS ANDERSON THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY TWO BOYS HAD BEEN LOST BUT ONLY ONE WAS FOUND IT WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT HAPPENED TO BRUCE NINETEEN YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO BOBBY HAD TAKEN THAT THEORY AND MADE IT INTO A MEMORY A MEMORY WHICH MIGHT HAVE SERVED IN OTHER PURPOSE ALTOGETHER IF BOBBY DUNBAR IS TO FULLY BECOME BOBBY DUNBAR THEN BRUCE ANDERSON NEEDS TO BE DEAD MAYBE IT WAS BY SETTLING ON THIS MEMORY THE OTHER BOY ON THE WAGON THAT HE CREATED THE LEGEND HE NEEDED TO BEGIN HIS NEW LIFE HIS OWN LEGEND A BOBBY DUNBAR HETO MACTHENIA YEAR SINCE WE FIRST BRODCAST THIS

BELIEVING ME O FAMIS ME TOSIPAI IT'S NOT JUST EMPOWERING TO BREAK THE RULES SOMETIMES SOMETIMES IT'S NECESSARY TO BREAK THE RULES FOR ANYWAY IT FEELS LIKE IT IS AND TO DAY ON OUR SHOW WE HAVE STORIES OF PEOPLE DEFYING REGULATIONS VIOLATING THE SOCIAL CONTRACT TO MAKE A POINT AND IN ONE CASE TO STRIKE OUT AGAINST THE INEQUITIES OF A SIX GREAT CLASS PLEASE STAY WITH US TANOOOBACK ONE TIME BANDAT THERE IS A MOMENT THIS YERE WHEN I WATCH SOME ONE BREAK THE RULES RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THE MOST DRAMATIC WAY DRAMATIC IS THE OPERATIVE WORD BECAUSE IT WAS DURING A PERFORMANCE IT WASN'T JUST IN FRONT OF ME THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THIS WAS DURING AN EVENT THAT I GO TO EVERY YEAR IF I CAN MAKE AT ON NEW YEARS DAY IT'S A TEN HOUR LONG MARATHON OF PERFORMANCE SAYS I CALL IT A MARATHON AT THE SAINT MARK'S POETRY PROJECT IN A TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD CHURCH IN LOWER MANHATTAN SO IMAGINE A SORING CAVERNA SANCTUARY WITH A PODIUM ON THE ALTAR UP FRON MOSTLY THE MARATHON IS SET UP AS A KIND OF CHURN THERE ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT JUST POETRY READINGS BUT BAN'S PLAY IN THEIR COIOGRAPHERIS AND COMMITEANS I'VE SEEN PADDY SMITH PERFORM THERE AND PHILLIP GLASS AND A EVERYBODY ONLY GETS TWO TO THREE MINUTES EACH TO READ OR PLAY OR WHATEVER THE TIME LIMIT'S A BIG DEEL AS THEY NEED TO FIT EVERYBODY AN OCCASIONALLY SOME ONE GETS ON STAGION BETWEEN ACTS AND TELLS EVERYBODY O KEEP IT SHORT AN WI THE SORT OF RULES SHATTERING MOMENT THAT HAPPENED WAS NOT ONE OF THE FAMOUS IS ON STAGE I WAS SOMEBODY I'D NEVER HEARD OF JEROMA IS IS A COMPOS A COMFORMERAN WRITER IS REASON WORD JEROM ALAS ICOMPOSER MUSICIAN BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE AN INSTRUMENT WITH HIM OR EVEN ANYTHING TO READ OFF OF HE JUST REAL CLIMBED UP ON STAGE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE MY AND I HAD TO ADMAT I WAS LEARLY JUST  LOOKING DOWN A MY O MAN A NOT AN TAN AN WHEN HE STARTED TALKING THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF TMOT THE GROSU THO SU HAS A LAW MANDATING THAT SELFON COMPANIES OFFER OF FIFTY PER CENT AND THEN HE STOPPED TALKING LIKE FOR A WHILE AND I THINK IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT I LOOKED AP AND SAW HIM SORT OF STARING WIDE EYED MAY BE TREMBLING A BIT I'M PLAYING THIS IN REAL TIME BY THE WAY NORMALLY I'D EDD IT THESE SILENCES DOWN BUT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW CONFUSING THIS WAS AT FIRST AND UNCOMFORTABLE FIFTY PER CENT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON SO SO FAR HE HAD SAID THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF MATO GROSO DOSUL HAS A LAW MANDATING THAT SELPHON COMPANIES OFFER A FIFTY PER CENT DISCOUNT TO ND THEN YOU CAN HEAR HE'S DURING THESE KIND OF LITTLE BREATHY CLICKS AND POPS AND I WAS LIKE O IT SOME PERFORMANCE AR THING LIKE SELF ON COMPANIES SPOTTY COVERAGE IN BRAZIL TO THE CUSTOMERS WITH FIFTY PER CENT DISCOUNT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH AND THEN HE BREAKS INTO PORTUGUESE WHICH YOU STUBIOUS NOT TIMPRSASO ENOUG FLUACIA THE FAL CUSTOMERS WITH BRAKS IN THE TIMING INFLUENCY OF SPEECH THAT IS THE CUSSOMER SU HAVE SPEECIAN PENMENTS LIKE MYSELF SO THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY HAVE TO THE CUSTOMER HAS TO PRESENT JEROME HAS A STUTTER A SIGNED STATEMENT FROM A SPEECH LANGUAGE A SIGNIFICANT ONE SPEECH LANGUAGE SPEECH LANGUAGE  CATHOLOGISTS TO PROVE THEIR PATHOLOGY I FIRST ENCOUNTED THIS LA IN A BOOK ABOUT STRANGE LAWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK WAS MOCKING THE LAW BUT I SEE IN THE LAW AND ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF TEMPORAL ACCESSIBILITY TEMPORAL ACCESSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO WHEN IT COMES WHEN IT COMES WHEN IT COMES TO TI SABLED SPEECH SO I WAS FIRST INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS MAGNIFICENT EVENT I WAS STRUCK BY THE TWO MINUTES TIME LIMIT WHICH LATER BECAME A TWO TO THREE MINUTE TIMEMET AND I UNDERSTOOD INTUITIVELY THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS TIME WHEN IT WAS TO CREATE AS NON HIERARCHICLE WITH SPACE AS POSSIBLE BUT IN REMOVING ONE HIERACHY THE TIME LIMITES INTRODUCES ANOTHER A TIME LIMIT ASSUMES THIT ALL PEOPLE HAVE RELATIVELY EQUAACCESS TO TIME THROUGH THIS SPEECH WHICH IS NOT TRUE STUDDERING IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE I CAN REHEARSE SOMETHING AS MANY TIMES AS I WANT BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW HOW ON WILL TAKE TO SAY ANYTHING UNTI I HAVE TO SAY IT WHAT YOU JUST HEARD US ABOUT HALF OF JERAM'S PERFORMANCE AS HE PERFORMED IT THAT NIGHT MY COMMENTARY NOT WITHSTANDING THE CLOCKS IN IT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES PRACTICALLY TWICE THE LENGTH PERMITTED ITSELF I'LL PLAY YOU THE SECOND HALF IN A BID BUT IN JUST THOSE FIVE MINUTES I'D GONE FROM BARELY PAYING ATTENTION TO BEING TOTALLY RAPPD EVERYBODY WAS THE PAUS IS CONTINUED SOME OF THEM LONGER THAN WHAT YOU JUST HEARD AND IN AN ENORMOUS ROOM PACKED WITH PEOPLE THERE WAS BARELY ANY OTHER SOUND I DON'T REMEMBER HEARING A COUGH OR PAPER RUSTLE WE'RE ALL JUST KIND OF SPELLBOUND PARTLY I THINK BECAUSE AS JERUM SAID HIMSELF WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON STAGE SEEMED SO VERY UNPREDICTABLE THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE IN THE AUDIENC E AND IN THE WEEKS AND MON SINCE THEN I REALIZED I JUST HAD ALL THESE QUESTIONS FOR JEROM THE WAY YOU WISH YOU COULD CALL UP THE PERSON WHO MADE THE WEIRD OBSCURE MOVY YOU JUST SAW THAT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD OR WHO WROTE THE BOOK YOU JUST READ I JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE DID HOW IT FELT TO DO THAT JEROMS CHON IAR OU IM DOING WELL SO I CALLED HIM YOU ONSKI O I FRIENDLY HIS FACE AND HADN'T HAD A HAIR CUT AN A WHILE LIKE EVERYBODY O THING I JERUM TOLD ME HE GOT THE IDEA AFTER THE DIRECTOR OF THE POET YYU PROJECT SENT HIM AN EMAIL INVITING HOM TO PERFORM AND MENTIONE THE TIME LAMET JUST READING THAT GAVE HIM THIS TANGE OF STRESS AND I WAS LIKE IAS LKE I NOTED THE STRESS NOS LIKE I THINK IT I'M INTERSTED GOING TOWARDS THAT STRESS AN LIKE EXPLOINED THAT HE SAYS THAT CONFUSION I FELT AT FIRST THAT'S WHAT HE WAS GOING FOR BECAUSE IT' SO COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT FEELING UPON MEETING HIM THEY DO'TKOW WHAT'S GOING ON UNTIL HE TELLS THEM IT'S NOT EASY TO BRING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TO AN EXPERIENCE YOU LIVE EVERY DAY BUT HE MANAGED IT I ALSO WONDERED IF HE HAD KIND OF IMPROVISED WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY BUT HE SAYS HE WROTE IT ALL OUT AHEAD OF TIME RE HEARSETET READING IT OFF HIS PHONE WHILE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WHICH WAS WAY EASIER THAN RECIDING IT ON STAGE HE SAYS WHAT WAS THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TOOK WHEN YOU WERE PREPARENG WHEN YOU WERE REHEARSING IT I WAS SAT A IT' YOU IN A HALF MINUTES SOON HALF MINES  YET AND I WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM HE SAYS TO WRITE SOMETHING THAT SOME ONE WHO DIDN'T STUTTER COULD RECITE WITHIN THE TIME LIMET SHEN THAT WAY HE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY ATHERING TO THE RULES AND BREAKING THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND SINCES TUTTERING SOME PREDICTABLE JERUM SAYS THERE WAS A CHANCE THE WHOLE THING COULD HAVE TAKEN HIM ONLY FORMINEE AND IT WAS A FUNNY SITUATION WERE STUTTERING LESS MIGHT HAVE MADE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE I FIGURED SIMPLY BEING ON STAGE WOULD MAKE HIM MORE IKELY TO STUDTER BUT JEROME'SAS KNOW IT'S IN FACT QUITE SOOTHING TO BE ON STAGE COSN'T SI YOU KNOW IT'S SIKE I ACTLY FEEL THAT THAT IM THAT I HAVE THE TIME I'M AN I ANDAN INTO SOME WAYS THE STAGE THE STAGE AUDIENCE LATIONSHIP IS A MORE TOMPORLY ACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENTS THEN OTHERE ENVIRONMENTS OF VEBL VEL VEBL VEBL E COMMUNICATION THAT I ENGAGE WITS LIKE WHEN HE WORKED AT THE COLUMBIA LAW LIBRARY JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND OF HIS LIFE OFF STAGE JEROME WORKED AT THE CIRCULATION DESK AND NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE TO TAKE IN CALLS BUT HE HAD TO TRANSFER CALLS TO OTHER PEOPLE SO ANSWERING THE PHONE THAT'S ONE TEMPORAL EXPECTATION AND THEN HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO SOME ONE ELSE WHOSE CALLING WHILE THE FIRST PERSONS ON HOLD NOW HE'S SQUASHED BETWEEN TWO TEMPORAL EXPECTATIONS IT WAS TRESTFUL ALSO THIS SHOW AND RADIO IN GENERAL IS NOT USUALLY AN ACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENT FOR DIFFERENTLY ABLED SPEAKERS A'M LEAVING IN A LOT OF JEROME STUTTERS IN THE INTERVIEW PART OF THI STORY BUT I'M STILL CUTTING OUT SOME OF HIS PAUSES AND REPEATS AND MIND FOR THAT MATTER AS A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS WERE BY US TOWARD MORE FLUID TALKERS AND BECAME ACUTELY AWARE OF THAT WHILE EDITING OUR CONVERSATION AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I TRIED TO QUOTUM QUOTE CLEAN UP HIS ANSWERS AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE CAUSE I WANT TO BRING YOU INTO JEROME'S DAILY EXPERIENCED TOO ANYWAY I THINK JEROME STUDTERED LESS THAN USUAL ON THE CALL WITH ME BECAUSE I KNOW HE STUDTERS HE SAYS IT HELPS TO DISCLOSE AT RELAXES HIM AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER SUBTLER WAYS THAT HE'S ABLE TO TAYMENT SOMETIMES WHEN HE'S TALKING TO PEOPLE SOMETIMES AREFER TO IT IS MY SUDER BUT SOMETIMES I REFERRED TO IT AS THESE STUDER THESE STUDDER BECAUS TO ME SUDDERING IS NOT BOUND TO MY BODY THAT IT IS A PHENOMENON THAT OCCURS BETWEEN ME AND WEVE M SEEKING TYOU LIKE I LIKE TO THINK OF IT LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHARE AND WHEN JEROME'S IN A CONVERSATION WITH SOME ONE HE STUDDERS PARTLY CAUSE THE BURDEN TO TALK SMOOTHLY IS ONLY ON HIM EXACTLY EXACTLY ONE WAY A SAY THAT'S LIKE  HE'S STUDDERE BUT HIT'S NOTHERWAY THAT'S LIKE THERE IS A SUDDER HAPPENING YOU KNOW AND WE ARE BOTH CONTENDING WITH IT S EEXACTLY AND HIS TALK AT THE POETRY PROJECT WAS THAT ON A GRAN SCALE THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED FOR EACH OF US TO SHOULDER A LITTLE OF THE WAIT OF THE STUTTER THAT WAS HAPPENING THE REASON FOR THOSE LONG SILENCES ON STAGE IS SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T KNOW EITHER JEROME'S PARTICULAR KIND OF STUDTER IS SOMETIMES CALLED A GLOTTLED LOCK THE WAY HE EXPLAINS THAT WHEN YOUR VOCAL PORDS ARE AT REST THER'RE ARE PART AND THEN WHEN YOU GO TO TALK THEY COME TOGETHER AND VIBRARY BUT SOMETIMES JEROME'S VOCAL QUARDS GETS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN BEING AT REST AND TOUCHING SO HE CAN STILL MAKE LITTLE SILENCE WITH HIS TEETH AND TONGUE AND LIPS BUT NOT HIS VOICE AND STALKING TO HIM ON SKIPE THE SAME THING WOULD HAPPEN AS WHEN HE WAS ON STAGE WHEN THE GLOTTLE BLOCK CAME HE GOT THIS LOOK KIND OF FROZEN WIDE EYED STARE LIKE HE WAS STUNNED EXCEPT ON STAGE IT WAS MORE DRAMATIC HIS FACE WOULD TURN UPWARD AND REMEMBER THINKING MYSELF IS THAT JUST EFFORT IS IT FEAR YE AND IA NOTHER LOOK YER OU'SE STEAKING ABOUT YA IT'S LIK SOME SDTERS WOO THERE THEIR BODY WILL WILLI'T FACT MOVE ALOUT WHIL THE STUDDING THERE FACE WOOE WE'LL MOVE A CERTAIN WAYS WHICH WHICH ICH IDU SOMETIMES BUT IN GENERAL MY MY BODY RESPONSES ACTSYT IS A FREEZING I AN AM I AND I SAW BREATHING OFTEN TOO JUST LIKE LIKE IF YUS LIKE EVERYTHING STOPS FOR A SECOND OR FIVE SECOND SO LONGER IM SO PART OF IT IS THAT IS THAT IN FREEZING PART OF IT FEELS LIKE MY BODY GOES INTO A KIND OF SUPPLICATION OR PRAYER ALMOST IM I'VE A FRIEND WHO WHO ONCE REFERRED TO IT AS WATCHING WATCHING ME ASK FOR THE WORD AND WAIT YOU KNOW AND AIT FR IT TO COME WAIK FOR TO COME YE AND EMBIANIC AS I OFTEN LOOK UP IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC STATE IS LIKE A THIS THERE IS SOME WAYS IN WHICH I LIKE WOTALLY LEAVE THE ROOM AND I I THING THAT SPEAKS TO THE THE LOOKING UPWARD AND I THEN JUST LIKE A LIKE A'LL COME BACK ONCE THE WORD ARRIVES AND IT WASN'T FEAR HE SAYS HE DOES HAVE A LOT OF FERS IN HIS DAILY LIFE THINKING TOO MUCH OF SOME ONE'S TIME NOT BEING ABLE TO ORDER A SHAKE SHACK WHEN THERE'S A LINE BEHIND HIM BUT THIS WASN'T THAT IF HE WAS AFRAID OF ANYTHING E WAS FALLING BACK ON THE TACTICS HE USUALLY USES TO GET AROUND TO STUTTER SYNONYMS FOR EXAMPLE SWAPPING OUT A WORD HE'S BLOCKED ON FOR ONE THAT'S EASIER TO SAY HE WANTED DO THAT ON THESTAGE AND IIM IM NI DINRULIS THAT UNTIL NOW THAT I THINK THAT WAS THE PRIMARY AND I DID DO THAT LIKE TWO OR THREE TIMES AND I  REGRETTED IT AFTERWARDS IM DO YOU REMEMBER WHICH WORDS YOU DID ID ON BY ANY CHAM YES TRU THE CUSTOMERS WITH SO THERE'S THE PORTUGUES WORD WITH I HE STUBI WHICH OU SCUBIOU MY PIMPRESO WHICH I HAD LITERALLY TRANSLATED TO IN MY TEXT I TRANSLATED IT TRANSLATED IT TRANSLATED IT TRANSLATED IT TRANSLATED IT TRANSLATSIT TOS TRU DISTURBANCE AND AS AS YOU JUST SAW THAT WORD IS STILL AS IS LIKE VERY HARD FOR ME TO SAY SO THAT I DID IT THE PERFORMANCE WAS CUSTOMERS WITH I SAID BREAKS BREAKS BREAKS IN THE TIME AND INFLUENCE IN THE TIMEING INFLUENCY OF SPEECH AND THAT WAS ONE THAT I I DIDN'T LIKE THAT I DID THAT  LIKE I WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS WHAT I I JUT SIT WITH WIT WITH YOU IS JUST WAIT WAIT FOR THE WATE BUT I BUT IT WAS ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY DEES HET CAN BE REALLY PAINFUL I WELL SO I AS MI AVOIDED THAT ONE AND AS FRESHY AS MYSELF A SUS AT HAPPEN I LIKE BREAKS TO ME TO  DOESN'T CAPTURE WHAT I WANTED TO CAPTURE ARE NAMES PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT YES YE YES BECAUSE AS A SYNDOMS FOR THEM YOU KNOW JERON BLOCKS ON HIS OWN NAME HAW SINCE HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD WHEN HAS STUTTER STARTED SO NOW TRYING TO SAY HIS NAME OR ANY NAME HE SAYS IT'S LIKE HES FOR AGAIN I EVEN I EVEN IN SOME SITUATIONS FOR A FEW YEARS I WOULD SAY IM JOHN TONS MY MIDDLE NAME BUT VERY INTERESTINGLY I AN BEGINS SETTING ON JOHN AND THEN I AND THEN I WAS SUC SAINT SHOHN AND BECAUSE SOME SOMETIMES THE SHUR SOUND AS E LIKE LIKE THE JUST SOUND AS I HAS A HARDER ATTACK AND ALSO IT OBVIOUSLY SHON IS JUST IN AND INAN INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL NAME AND TI WAS BEALY I ME NOW AS MY DOL AS MY MAIN REASONING FOR JOSIS I WELL IF I'M N IT I MAN TO CHOOSE THE NEW NAME WHILE I JUST GOTI TO THE TOP JUST GO FOR THE TOP ANS OYUNO AND THAS I SETTHING ON THAT YOU KNOW I MEAN I JUST FIND THAT THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL ITS LKE IT'S ALWAYS OUT PASING ME IN IN A WAY YOU FIND THAT BEAUTIFUL THAT IT'S OUT PACING YOU YE YE I MAN I FIND IT PAINFUL TO BUT I BUT A I FIND IT A DEEP DEAUTY IN THAT I WHAT IS THE BEAUTY BET FOR ME IT'S THE QUALITY THAT IT'S LIKE THE SUDDER IT FEELS LIKE THE SHING THAT IT IS SO DEEPLY AND TWIME WITH MY BODY MY MIND MY EMOTIONS EVERYTHING AND YET I I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT OR I CAN'T GRASP IT AND AND AND EVEN MORE SO LIKE WHEN I THINK I HAVE GRASPED IT LIE LIKE WHEN I THINK ATBOUT SMART IT IT EVEN LIKE MY SWITCHING MY NAME IM THE SOMETHING ABOUT JUS I WE LOSIVE IT IS THE SECOND HALF OF JEROME'S PERFORMANCE WAS JUST ONE SENTENCE IT TOOK IM FOUR MINUTES AND NINE SECONDS TO GET THROUGH PARTLY BECAUSE IT HAD A NAME AT THE BEGANNING THE BLACK FRIMINIS THE SENTENCE BEGAN THE BLACK FEMINIST SCHOLAR KIMBERLY CRENSHAW ONCES ROAD AND THEN A QUOTE CLIMBING ON TOP OF CRENCHAW'S NAME ALONE TOOK HIM ABOUT A MINUTE FORTY FIVE SECONDS I HAVEN'T PAUSED THE RECORDIG OF THE PERFORMANCE BY THE WAY IT'S STILL RUNNING UNDERNEATH THUS MY CHEST WAS HEADING SO MUCH SIT AND WHILAS DOING OS LIKE COTCH I JUST LIKE GIVE UP AND LEAVE YOU KNOW AND IWAS LIKE KNO I MEAN I I'VE DONE THAT SOMEBODY LIKE A ME TE SO MANY MOMENTS AND IN LIFE WHERE IVER I JUST LIKE I JUST STOP SPEAKING THAT IS TO ONE TO PUT IN IN THE LABOR OF FINISHING MY THOUGHT OR FINISHING MY MY SENTENCE SOUNDS LIKE KNO I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT HERE I WANTED TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE THE LABOUR THAT'S OF ALL AND THIS IS LABOR THAT I OFTEN OR SOMETIMES WON'T PUT IN THE BLACK FRIMINO SCHOLAR BUT IT WAS AROUND THIS MOMENT THAT THE FEELING IN THE ROOM STARTED TO CHANGE AGAIN THERE WAS NO MORE CONFUSION OBVIOUSLY AND THAN HE CONCERN OR TENSION WAS GONE TOO BLACK FRIM I SCHOLAR BY THIS POINT THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT JEROME WAS SAYING HAD LANDED ON US AND THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE THING HE WAS SAYING AND THE WAY HE WAS SAYING AT LIKE A POEM ALONGATED SO IT JUST TOOK US A LITTLE LONGER TO CATCH UP PIMBERLY CRENSHAW WONCE ROTE I GENT STOPPED THE RECORDING FOR A SECOND IN JUST  READ YOU THE QUOTE SO YOU CAN SIT WITH IT DURING THIS LAST PART IT GOES TREATING DIFFERENT THINGS THE SAME CAN GENERATE AS MUCH AN AN EQUALITY

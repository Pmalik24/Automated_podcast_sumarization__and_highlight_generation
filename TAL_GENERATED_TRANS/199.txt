THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE FROM AN OVERDSE EACH YEAR THAT MEANS AN AMERICANS ARE NOW MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM AN OVERDOSE THAN FROM A CAR ACCIDENT THIS HOTLINE'S PURPOSE IS SIMPLE AND VERY SINGLE MINDED IT'S NOT TO GET PEOPLE SOBER OR PUSH THEM INTO TREATMEN IT'S JUST TO KEEP PEOPLE ALINE ONE INJECTION OR SNORT AFTER ANOTHER I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR EVERY ONE THE CALLERS AND THE PEOPLE LIKE JESSE WHO SAIT THERE WILL SOME ONE USES KNOWING THEY COULD DIE RIGHT THERE ON THE PHONE JESE TALKS TO PEOPLE WEEK AFTER WEEK S SOMETIMES THEY JUST STOP CALLINE MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE

BOOK NORTHADAMS MASSACHUSETTS THE SOB THAT LEFT THIS MANS SHES I'LL NEVER FORGET HES THAT WAS ME ACT TOO STEPHEN STEPHEN MURRAY THE PARAMETIC WHO RESPONDED TO THAT OVERDOSE CALLD JESSE TOOK HE HAD A LOT OF JOBS BEFORE WORKING IN AN AMBULANCE EACH WITH A VERY DIFFERENT UNIFORM THE FIRST WAS A BLACK TEASHIRT HE WAS IN A METAL BAND THEN A SUDAN TIE WHEN HE'S IN COLLEGE SHE RAN FOR A SEAT ON THE VILLAGE COUNCIL IN ONE BEING A PARAMETIC BEEN WEARING A BUTTON UP WITH A SMURRAY ON ONE POCKET AN A BADGE ABOVE THE OTHER HE CARRIED HIS DISPATCH RADIO PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE WHICH IS HOW A GOT THE CALL THAT DAY SO AM THET CAME IN S A ON RESPONSIVE POSSIBLE OVERDOS THAT'S ALWA BLY OT WHEN I HEARD THE ADDRESS I WAS LIKE OL THATUALLY CLOSE BY IT WAS RIGHT UP THE HILL FROM THE AMBULANC STATION BASICALLY ON THE SAME STREET WERLILY POINT FOUR PORNT FIVE MILES AWAY SO I JUMP IN HOW MANY PEOPLE IT WAS ONE ENGINE COMPANY THREE POLICE CRUISERS AND SHO AMANSES WE GET THERE D AND LOOKING AT THE BUILDING IN IT'S THERE'S MULTIBLE YOUNIT'S WITHIN THE THESPIG HOUSE HE BANGS ON THE DOOR DOESN'T HEAR ANYTHING THEN HE SEES A LITTLE STAIRAWAY RONS UP FINDS ANOTHER DOOR WHICH IS UNLOCKED HE LETS HIMSELF IN AM LIKE HALLO ANYBODY HERE LIKE YO MESS WITH THE COPS AR BY ME THERE YELLING OUN OOKIN AROUND AND AM I GET DOWN THIS HALLWAY AT THE END THERE IS THE LITTLE BATHROOM AND I FIND A GIRL LYING ON THE GROUND A WOMAN LAON THERM SHE VERY SMALL AND SHE LOOKD RUALLY YOUNG AND SHE WAS BLUE AND SO HOWS I CRAP WHY HOLD IT WHY WHALL BES KNO ITE'S THERE AND SHE'S BLUE WHEN SOME ONE'S BLUE I KNOW THER NOT BREATHING HOU THUGHT YOU WERE TOO LATE YES HER MY MIND WHEN IMMEDIATELY WAS AT HERE SOMEBODY HIS ALONE SHE'S BLUE ON THE GROUND AND I FIND HER PULSE AN IT'S QUITE SLOW SO IT'S LIKEIN THE FORTIESE SO I TURN TO THE COPPOSITE SHE'S GOT A PULSE THE BATHROM IS QUITE SMALL THOUGH AND I'M BIG AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO WORK ON SOMEBODY WHEN YOU CAN'T KNEEL DOWN NEXT TO THEM AND SO I PUT MY ARMS UNDER HERS AND I DRAG HER IENTO H LIVING ROOM DOWN HALLWAY TO LIVHERE AND AT THAT POINT AM THE REST OF MY CREW I BROUGHT ALL OF OUR QUIPMENT UPSTAIRS SO THEY WERE LIKE THEY CAME UP PUT DOWN HER BACK NEXT TO ME IF THEY'D GOTTEN THERE A FEW MINUTES LATER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO LATE BUT NOW THEY HAD A CHANCE STEHEN'S GOT A PARTICULAR WAY HE LIKES TO HANDLE OVER DOSES THAT HE FEELS IS EASIER ON THE PEOPLE BEING REVIVED BECAUSE HE'S THUGH ABOUT THIS ALOT IF THEY DO COME TO IT'S CONN'T BE A VERY STRANGE EXPERIENCE SOME RANDOM GUY LEANING OVER YOU FACE UPSIDE DOWN AND IF HE JUST GIVES SOME ONE A BIG DOSE OF NARCAN IT'LL THROW THEM INTO WITHDRAWAL  PEOPLE SOMETIMES WAKE UP ANGRY BHE'L HAVE A MASSIVE HEADACHE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN GETTING OXYGEN TO THEIR BRAIN THAT LACK OF OXYGEN THAT'S WHAT HI'LL KILL YOU IN AN OVER DOSE SO STEPHEN STARTS BY FIXING THOT SO I GRAP THE BAG OUT MASK OUT POPKED UP OXYGEN AND START TO BREATHE FOR HER AND IN THE MEANTIME I DIRECTED ON OF MI STAFFEMBERS TO DRAW ME UP AT TO PLOTN OR CAN AND PUT A A KNEEDL ON IAUS I LIKE TO GIVE IT INTER MUSCULARLY CAUSE I CAN CONTROL THE DOSE BETTER HE HAS THE POLICE STAND IN ANOTHER ROOM WHILE HE WORKS WELL BECAUSE THE THING IS I'VE SEEN PEOPLE COME OUT AND VAMET AND FEEL IN WELL AND AWHEN I FIRST STARTED NE AMASS I REMEMBERR LIKE THE POLICE TO BE STANDING OVER THEM LIKE WHAT DID YOU USE LIKE YELLING AT THEM IS TURNE TO THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT IS THAT VIRONMEN LIKE WHET THEY WAKE UP IF IT'S A THEIR R TWONY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM I WILL LIKE TELL PEOPLE WHE WE OUTSIDE SO STEPHEN'S KNEELING OVER KIMBER'S HEAD SQUEEZING OXYGEN INTOR HER LUNGS ONE BREATH AT AT TIME THEN HE GIVES HER THE SMALLEST DOSE OF NILOCXON  JUST TO SEE HOW SHORE WE ACT HER COLOR IMPERVES HER OXEN SATURATION COMES UP AND SHE THEN WAKES UP DO YOUREMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID TO YOU SHE LOOKED UPSET UPSET DESPITE ALL HIS EFFORT BUT ALIVE THERE'S A CONVERSATION STEPHEN SOMETIMES HAS WITH PEOPLE HE'S REVIVED HE DOESN'T REMEMBER WHRE IT HAPPENED WITH KIMBER BUT OFTEN IT'S IN THE BACK OF THE AMBULANCE WHERE THE DRIVER CAN'T HEAR R THE PATIEN WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE HE'S SO MUCH NICER THAN OTHER AMPTEES AND IN STEPHEN WILL EXPLAIN I'VE BEEN IN YOUR SHESES SO STEPHEN THE PERSON WHO REVIVED KIMBER FROM HER OVER DOSE HE'D ALSO SURVIVED AN OVER DOSE LET ME TELL YOU IT HAPPEN STPHEN STARTED USING DRUGS SOME TIME AFTER HE STOPPED TOURING WITH HOUT METAL BANDS HEHAD BEEN STRAIGHT EDGE THEN SO NO NOCK ALL NO DRUGS BUT THEN HE WENT TO COLLEGE YOU NA RECEIVED MY AMMY AN I CADEMICS HAD NEVER BEEN AS THING THE PEOPLE THAT I LIKE FELLIN WITH LIKE MY GROUP BEFRIENDS IM WE ALL MET LIKE AT THIS THE TABLES AT WEREOUTSIDE THE DOORMS AND WE LIKE BUT SPOKE CIGARETTES OUTSIDE IS LIKE THIS THING AND AM THE GUI THET USED TO SELL US ARE WEED HE WAS GREAT HE WASD TOS LIKE THIS REALLY COOLS LIKE AT I CAVE DESCRIBE HIM HE WAS LIKE AM HE WOULD SHOW UP WITH A FISHING TACKLE BOX FULL OF DRUGS IT WAS LIKE OF MANRAY AND LIKE HE KNEW THAT I WAS I HAD BEEN STRUGGLAING A BAC A FRIEND OF THE GROUP NAMED KELLY HAD DIED RECENTLY SHEU'D FALLEN OFF ABALCONY REALLY ON A ROCKED STEPHEN'S WORLD AND SO HE WAS LIKE A LIKE IF I REMEMBER RIGHT HE WAS A GI TRY THESELY TO FEEL BETTER AND THAT WAS LIKE OXICOTOM SIR DRUGS BECAME PART OF STEPHEN'S VERY BUSY LIKE HE'S GOING TO SCHOOL WORKING CAMPUS JOB HEAD ALSO ON THAT SEAT ON THE LOCAL VILLAGE COUNCEL AT THE TIME THEY WERE SAYING I WAS THE YOUNGEST ELECTED OFFICIAL AND EVER HAPPENED IN SOUTH FLORIDA A NOT THAT'S LIKE VEREFI BIKE LIKE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING ABOUT ME AND LIKE AND HERE I AM LIKE USING DRUGS ALLTIME HE USED IN HIS CAR BEFORE TALKING TO TEEVY NEWS BEFORE BED HE WOULD LAY OUT LINES OF OXY FOR WHEN HE WOKE UP AT NIGHT AND WITHDRAWL HE WAS ON MY WAY HE GET BACK TO SLEEP

THERE I NO ONE WAS SAYING ANYTHING AND HE WAS LIKE OH I KNOW WHAT THIS IS BUT HE FELT RELIEVED TO BE FOUND OUT HE ONLY HAD TO GO TO REHAB ONCE BUT RECOVERY WAS A LONG PROCESS STEPHEN TRIED VARIOUS JOBS RAN OUT OF MONEY WENT BACK TO LIVING WITH HIS FOLKS THEY WERE RETIRED IN WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE HE NOTICED THEY WERE LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEER FIRE FIRES SO SINED UP AND FOR SOME REASON IT'S STOCK IN MY HEAD IN MY MIND IN LIKE ONESTEPHEN THE ANIC AN LIKE NOUNCED EVEN THE FIREFANER HI WAS LIKE I'M FIRE FRENDER THAT'S PRETTY COOL EVENTUALLY HE BECAME A PARAMATIC STEPHEN'S EXPERIENCE WITH A DICTION IS NOT WHAT MADE SAPHEN CAMBER SO EMOTIONAL FOR HIM THOUGH IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE BACK WHEN STEPHEN WAS USING HIS DRUGS WERE COMING FROM PAIN CLENNECS KNOWN AS PELL MELLS BUT BY THE TIME HE BECAME A PARAMETIC MANY OF THOSE HAD BEEN SHUT DOWN MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE GETTING DRUGS OFF THE STREET THAT'S WHEN FENTINEL ENTERED THE SCENE THAT INOLO COULD BE FIFTY TIMES STRONGER THAN HEROINE HE WAS CAUSING THESE CLUSTER OVERDOSES STEPHEN WOULD SEETHEM FROM HIS AMBULANS HE HAD HAVE DAYS WER OULD GO TO FIVE ODEES ONE AFTER ANOTHER HE WAS SAEING MORE PEOPLE DIE TOO ONE CASE STUCK WITH HIM

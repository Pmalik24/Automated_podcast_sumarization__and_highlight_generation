IS SO NERVOUS AND WHAT HE HOPED TO GET OUT OF THE GIG HE CAN HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT JOB MEANS FROM THE FIRST PLACE AND SO THAT IS WEREOF HEVA IS MA START BEFORE GETTING INTO THE SANTA BUSINESS ALLEN HAD A JOB THOUG A SORT OF THE OFFICEIT OF BEING SANTA HE WAS A CORRECTION'S OFFICER AT A STATE PRISON HED GOTTEN INTO THE WORK BECAUSE HE NEEDED THE MONEY AND STABILITY AND STAYED FOR OVER TWO DECADES BUT HE HATED IT AND FELT INCREASINGLY QUEEZY ABOUT THE WHOLE SYS STEM AND HIS ROLL ON IT AND THEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN HE GOT A BREAK FROM IT THOUGH NOT UNDER GREAT CONDITIONS HE I REALY SICK ANDED UP HAVING TO TAKE NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF OFF FROM MARK FOR MEDICAL LEVE HE GOT DEPRESSED STOPPE SHAVING GER ALONG BEARD ONE DAY TO CHEER HIMSELF AT ALLEN AND HIS WIFE ARRAND DECIDED TO GO TO A COMIC BOOK CONVENTION IS OBVIOUSLY I'M CIND OF A NERVED AND I ENJOY THAT SORT OF THING BUT I WENT THERE AND IT WASNIT REALLY HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKING A BREAK FROM WALKING AROUND IN THE CONVENTION AND I'M SITTING IN A LITTLE CAFFE IN HIM YOU KNOW HAVING SOMETHING A DRINKER EATING A SANMICH I DON'T RLY REMEMBER BUT THERE'S HIS GUY THERE HE SAYS HEY I LIKE YOUR BEARD AND I WONT OH I THANKS AN HE GAVE ME THIS LITTLE CARD IN WHAT IT IS  SA IT'S A RECRUITMENT CART FOR THIS FRATERNAL ORDER OF REAL BEARDED SANCES THERE'S SOMETHING VERY SORT OF TIED TO THE REAL WORLD ABOUT THE IDEA OF RECRUITING A SANTA WHEN IT FEELS LIKE IT SHOULD JUST BE LIKE SOME SNOW FALLS ON YOUR SHOULDER SOMETHING THAN YOU BECOME SANTA THHE HAD BUT KNOW THIS WAS JUST A GUY I SITTING AROUND AT A COMICON A TAK TO VERY DOZEN FIRST TIMES SANTAS IN REPORTING THE STORY NEARLY EVERY ONE HAD THIS IN COMMENT IT WAS SOME ONE ELSE WHO FIRST TIDENTIFIED THAN THE SANTA TURNS OUT THAT IS THE MAGICAL SNOW THAT FALLS ON YOUR SHOULDER ALLEN SHOWS A BUSINESS CARD TO HIS LIFE ERRAND WHE SUGGESTS HE DRESS UP FOR THERE GOT SONS KIDS CHRISTMAS  STILL MONTHS AWAY BUT IT MIGHT GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO I'M THINKING A CALL I I DO HAVE THE SPEARD NOW AND THA I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THER DEFINITELY ON THE ROAD TUN SIDE OF THINGS SO I'VE GOT THAT WORKING FOR ME AND I WENT WELL I SHOULD COULD FEEL IN SARRY FOR MYSELF IN MAYBE DO SOMETHING WITH THIS NOW ALLEN FIGURES HE'LL PLAY SANTA JUST AS ONCE AS A NICE THING TO DO FOR HIS FAMILY SINCE HE'S LIKE A GRANDFATHER TO THESE KIDS ALLEN WAS WORRIED THEY MIGHT RECOGNIZE HIM HE BLEACHED HIS BEARD WHITE AN ASKED A FRIEND WHO KNOWS HOW TO SOW TO MAKE HIM A RED SUIT BUT AND CHRISTMAS EVE AS HE'S HUTTING OVER TO THE HOUSE HE REALIZES HE ACTUALLY IS NO IDEA WHAT

ELERGIC TO NATURAL SUNLIE I DIDN'T REALLY GROW UP CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS I WAS RAISED HEN DO BY EMIGRANTS WHO JUST DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE HOLIDAY THE EXTENT OF OUR DECORATIONS WAS A SPARSE PLASTIC TREE WITH SCREWED IN BRANCHES THAT LOOKED LIKE IF A SPRUCE HAD RECENTLY BEEN SET UPLAYS OUR FAMILY'S DEDICATION TO THE HOLIDAY WAS ALWAYS CARTUNISHLY PATHETIC BUT WHEN I MET MY AXTS A LITTLE OVER TEN YEARS AGO I REALIZE THAT BEING WITH HIM MENT BEING WITH A CHRISTMAS PERISEN IT WAS LIKE JOINING A CULT WHERE THE BELIEF STRUCTURE WAS BUILT AROUND A GLAZED HAM BEING WITH HIM MET WE BOUGHT A REAL LIVE TREE YEAR AFTER YEAR FELLING OUR APARTMENT WITH PINE MEEDLES THAT I'D FINED UNTIL WE BOUGHT THE NEXT REAL LIVE TREE DOESN'T IT SMELL GRAT HE'D SAY AND I REPLY WITH NO BECAUSE YEARS OF

LITTLE HOME TOWN WITH THE THREE CARSENTA CLAUS PARADE AND HIS STEPMOTHER'S GINGERBRED VILLAGE AT THE GRANDCHILDREN BICARED OVER AND THE MINSAUCE WITH HIS DAD'S LAMB AND THE CHRISTMAS BRUNCH WITH HIS MOTHER I WAS ALWAYS FIGHTING AGAINST MY INSTINCTS TO HATE EVERYTHING TO BE SYNICAL TO ASK TO BE LEFT ALONE I DIDN'T LIKE CHRISTMAS BECAUSE IT REQUIRED SO MUCH SINCERITY AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE I CLEARLY OBVIOUSLY STILL LACK WE SEPARATED IN FEBRUARY AND HE'S NOW OFF BUILDING A LIFE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HOW HE'D DO ALONE AT CHRISTMAS BUT YOU KNOW WHO IS ALONE IN ACTUALITY ME THE CHRISTMAS HATER I'M GRINCH AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN LOOKING DOWN AT THE DENIZENS OF HOOVILLE ASKING AND THE SMALLEST VOICE POSSIBLE DO THEY MISS ME DOWN THERE BECAUSE THOUGH I WAS ALWAYS LOTH TO

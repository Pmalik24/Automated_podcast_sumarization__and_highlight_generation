ANDEU THOMAS NORMY LIVES IN SAINT PAUL BUT HE'S ONE OF THESE DOCTORS AND NURSES WHO FOOD IN NEW YORK TO HELP WITH FLOOD OF COVED PATIENTS WHO FILLED NEWL HOSPITALS HE'S ACTUALLY THE HOSPITAL COMBE UNIVERSITY WHERE HE WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL A QUARTER CENTURY AGO AN NIGHT AFTER IS TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS HE SLEEPS IN HIS OLD DORMITORY LITERALLY IN THE DORN ROOM HE HAD WHEN HE WAS TWENTY THREE THE HOSPITAL SCRATCHED OUT ALL KINDS OF EXTR SPACE FOR COVERED PATIENTS COVRATING TWENTY FOUR OPERATING ROOMS INTO INTENTSIVE CARRY UNITS BUT THE STRANGEST THING TO HIM NORMALLY THERE BE FAMILY ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT THE FAMILIES ARE NOT ABLE TO COME CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL WE GA EVEN COM IN TO THE LOBBY THAT LOBJECT TO SEE THE PEOPLE THEY LOV AVERY OTHER FIGURES IUS TO REALITY THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE CAN DIE A IN THESE PLACES ALONE MOST OF THEM RE UNCONSCIOUS EN MEDICALLY INDUCE COMAS CAUS HES YOU TO SURVIVE ON A VENAATER THAT WAY BBECAUSE THEY'E UNCONSCIEUS IT MEANS THAT THE GAP BETWEEN THESE COVERED PATIENTS IN THEI FAMILIES IS EVEN MORE PROFOUND AS DID DN'T TALK ON THE PHONE OR FACE TIME OR ANYTHING STRANGER SUGGESTED TO THE NURSES THAT MAYBE THEY SHOULD TAKE NOTES EACH DAY LITTLE THINGS THEY KNOWIS ABOUT EACH PATIENT TO SHARE WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE PATIENT DIES I ASKED HIM TO ETERFEEL SURE AM THIS ONE OME A NURSE NAME SANDY AND SHE RODE  A MISS IS ONCE O THE NAME AH THE PATIENT IS MOSTLY SLEEPING SHE LOOKS PEACEFUL ALSO I REALLY LIKE HER DARK REED FINGERNAIL POLISH I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THE NAME OFK THE COLOR A HERE'S ANOTHER ONE A IVE BEEN PARTING AH THE PATIENTS HARE TO THE SIDE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S HOW HE WEARS IT BUT I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD THAT WAY ALSO YESTERDAY HE GOT A SHAVE AND NOW HE LOOKS SO YON U HERE'S ONE MORE THE PATIENT LOOKS SO PEACEFUL HES SLEEPING AND CALM EVERY ONE IS JEALOUS OF HIS SALT AND PEPPER HAIR HE LOOKS LIKE GEORGE CLUTING RIGHT NOW A DOCTER FEW OF THE NURSES WHO ARE WRITING THESE NOTES AND THEY SAID THAT CAUSE THE PATIENTS ARE UNCONSCIOUS THER WRE NER ACTIONS A PRETTY BASIC SO FIGURING OUT WHAT TO WRITE CAN BE TRICKY THACTER THOMASES AT FOR SURE YES SO SO PEOPLE AND AT FOLKIS SING ON YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN SEE WHICH IS EMBELLISHMENTS LIKE YEARINGS AND HARISTYLES AND FINGERNAIL POLISH AND ALL SO JIS TRYING TO EMPASIZE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ARE COMFORTABLE THAT THER THER SLEEPING THE'RE NOT IN THEY'RE NOT IN PAIN THAT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO THAT ALMOST EVERY ALL THE NURSES COMMENT ON THAT IT SEEMS OAN ALMOST EVERY ONE AND AND WHAT YOUR HYPABOUT ABOUT HOW THE FAMILIES WOULD TAKE THIS MY HOPE IS THAT THE FAMILIES WILL KNOW THAT THERE LOVED ONE WERE BEING SEEN AS PEOPLE ENTREATED AS PEOPLE AND THAT THEY WERE IN ALONE A AS THE HAPPEN SO THEY GATHER DETAILS ABOUT THE PEOPLE LAYING IN FRONT OF THEM KNOWING THAT THE SOMETHING LIKE AN EGHTY PER CENT CHANCE THT OF THE RUN OF VENTOLATOR WITH COVED THEY WON'T LIVE THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS IN NEW YORK THOSE TWO THINGS ARE SO DIFFERENT IN SIZE RITING DOWN A FEW TINY OBSERVATIENTS MEASURED AGAINST THE ENORMITY OF DEATH  WHAN THAT MEANS BUT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO AND TO DAY IN OUR PROGRAMME WE HAVE TWO STORIES WERE ORDINARY PEOPLE RISE TOF THIS EXACT TASK THEY LOOK A DATH STANDING THERE I GANTIC HARIFINE AND THEY SAY SOMETHING AND AN THESE STORIES TRULY AMAZING THINGS HAPPEN NBEBEASY CHICAGO SIYS AMERICAN LIFE A MARI GLASS THEY WITH US TRPAFT ONE REALLY ON DISTANCE S REMEMBER THAT SUNAMI THE JAPAN MARCH TWENTY ELEVEN GIANT BLACK WAVES MWERE THAN THIRTY FEET TALL IT JAPAN AAN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED OZUCI SHOT THIS VIDIO HE CA NEAR KNOWING A UNN ALL THE HOUSES OR WASE WAAAN A HAD  HOU'D BEEN THERE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS THIRTY MINUTES IT WAS GONE AMOST WHOLLY FLATEN  ZUNAMI AND THE EARTHQUAKE THE WON WITH IT KILLED SIX TIMES MORE PEOPLE THAN DIED NINE ELEVEN OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ARE STILL MISSING AND THE AFTER MASS OF COURSE FAMILY STRUGGLED FOR YOU AT HOW THEY WOEN MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE AND IN THAT TOWN OF OTZUCI IT LED TO THIS NEW NON A RICUO IS NOT EXACTLY RET WORD FOR THIS BUT IT SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT THI THING THAT PEOPLE INVENTED TO STAY CONNECTED TO THE DEAD ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS MAKING ME HAS FAMILY IN JAPAN AND SHE GREW UP GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THERE AND HERE IT YHO WATCHIS DOCUMENTARY BYT THIS THING PEOPLE WERE DOING IN O ZUCI ON THE JAPANESE NEWSCHANNEL AND  CH K AND GOT PERMISSION FOR US TO PLAY YOU SOME EXSERBS HERE'S MEKI OF ALL THE AREAS IN JAPAN EFFECTEDE BY THE SUNAMI UT ZUCCI HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF MISSEING PEOPLE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE TO DAY IT STILL PARTLY IN RUINS AND PARTLY A CONSTRUCTION SIDE AS THEY TRID TO REBUILD THE TOWN ON HIGHER GROUNDS BUT A YEAR BEFORE THAT ZUNAMI HAPPEND THIS SKY NAME ETATI SASAKI HE WAS ALREADY DEALING WITH A LOSS HIS COUSIN HAD JUST DIED AND E TATTERI WAS HAVING A HARD TIME FIGERING OUT HOW TO TALK ABOUT IT SO HE DID SOMETHING PRETTY IN GENIUS HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT AN OLD FASHIONED PHONE BOOTH AND STOCK IT IN HIS GARDEN IT LOOKS LIKE AN OLD ENGLISH STYLE ONE ITS SQUARE AND PAINTED WHITE AND HAS HI'S GLASS WINDOW PANES INSIDE IS A BLACK RODERY PHONE RESTING ON A WOOD SHELF THIS PHONE CONNECTED TO NOWHERE IT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL THUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER TO E TATO HE JUST NEEDED A PLACE FOR HE FELT LIKE HE COULD TALK TO HIS COUSIN A PLACES WHERE HE COULD EIR OUT ITS GREEF AND SO PUTTING AN OLD PHONE BOOTH IN HIS GARDEN WHICH SITS ON THIS LITTLE WINDY HILL OVERLOOKING THE PACIFIC OCEAN IT FELT LIKE A PERFECT SOLUCEAN THROUGH RNO MORO SO TE TO COSEVAN BECAUSE MY THOUGHTS COULD NOT BE RELAVED OVER A REGULAR PHONE LINE I WANTED THEM TO BE CARRIED ON THE WIND THROUGH THE CTHROG SO I NAMED IT THE WIND TELEPHONE CASI NO DANLA THE IDEA OF KEEPING UP A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEAD IS NOT SUCH A STRANGE ONE IN JAPAN THE LINE BETWEEN OUR WORLD AND THER WORLD IS THIN LOTS OF FAMILIES KEEP A BOODHIST ALTAR FOR THEIR DAD RELATIVES IN THE LIVING ROOM MY UNCLE HAS ONE FOR OUR FAMILY THERE ARE PHODOS ON A LITTLE PLATFORM AND EVERY DAY HE LEAVES FRESH FRUT AND RICE FOR THEM LIGHTS IN CENSE AND RINGS HE BALL THE WAY TO STAND TOUCH TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEYRE STILL A BIG PART OF OUR FAMILY SO AFTER THAT ZUNAMIN EARTHQUAKE HAPPEN WORD GOT OUT ABOUT ETATOS SPECIAL WIND TELEPHONE THAT HE WAS USING IT AS ANOTHER WAY TO STAY CONNECTED TO THE DEAD SOON PEOPLE STARTED SHOWING AP BRANDIDLY ON HIS PROPERTY AND WALKING RIGHT INTO THE PHONE BOOTH THIS HAS BEN GOING ON FOR FIVE YEARS NOW HE TATO ESTIMATES THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER JAPAN HAVE COME TO USE HIS PHONE A TEDI STATION ASSI TADO AND THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO USE HIS PHONE IF THEY COULD VIDIOTAPE THEIR CALLS FROM A DISTANCE AND PUT AN AUDIO RECORTER IN THE PHONE BOOTH THEY WANTED TO GET A SENSE OF HOW PEOPLE ARE STILL GRIEVING I WATCH THEIR DOCUMENTARY AFTER THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUNAMI BACK IN MARCH THAT WHOLE WEEK ALL THE NEWSPROGRAMS IN JAPAN WERE AIRING MEMORIAL PROGRAMS BUT I FOUND THE CALLS IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM REMARKABLE AND MOVING FOR JUST HOW SIMPLE THEY WERE ONE WOMAN FROM OZUCI NAME SICHIKO O CKAA SHOWED UP ONE AFTERNOON SHE SEVENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND LOST HER HUSBAND IN THE SUNAMI SHE REGULARLY BRINGS HER TWO YOUNG GRANDSONS TO THE PHONE BOOTH AND YOU CAN TELL BY HOW CASUALLY THEY TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE THEY SQUIPT INTO THE ONE BOOTH WITH HEIR GRANDMA WEARING MATCHING BLUE IN BLACK STRIKE SHIRTS SICHIKO STARTS THE CALL BY PICKING UP THE RECEIVER AND SAYING HALLO I WA W YE  HURLD HIST GRANDSON QUICKLY JUMPSON  A HIGH GRANDPA O  HOW ARE

MORE THAN SHE LOVED TO HIM SHELDEN DIDN'T MOVE OUT WITH HER AND AFTER A YEAR THEIR MOTHER RETURNED AND TOGETHER LESAN SHELDEN GREW UP UNDER THE SAME ROOF AND THE SAME BEDROOM OFTEN SLEEPING UNDER THE SAME BLANKETS EACH KNOWING WHO THE MOTHER HAD SCHOSEN AND EACH HAVING TO DO THEIR BEST TO CARRY ON AND LIVED LIFE WITH THE BURDEN OF THAT KNOWLEDGE A COUPLE TIMES DURING THE DAY I ASKED THEM WHY THEY HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN SO LONG AND THEY BOTH INSIST MAYBE OUT OF EMBARRASSMENT THAT THEY DO TALK JUST NOT OFTEN BUT IT ISN'T TRUE IN FACT MY FATHER LEARNED OF SHELDEN'S WIFE'S DEATH MANY YEARS AFTER THE FACT AND THEN ONLY FROM ME SHELDEN'S DATHER GOT EN TOUCH THROUGH FACE BOOK AND WE MADE A PHONE DATE WHERE SHE CAUGHT ME UP ON HER LIFE AND SHELDEN'S AND A FEW NIGHTS LATER WHILE OVER AT MY PARENTS FOR

GRANDMOTHER CAME BACK FOR SHELDEN NOT MY FATHER FOR MY FATHER NOT ONLY DID IT PUSH HIM AWAY FROM SHELDEN MAKING HIM FEEL SEALOUS AND RESENTFUL BUT IT ALSO CAST A SHADOW OVER THE REST OF HIS LIFE CAUSING HIM TO ALWAYS FEEL PASSED OVER HE'S MELLOWED WITH AGE BUT AS A KID I SAW IT COME OUT IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS ALWAYS SENSITIVE TO SLIGHTS READY FOR A FIGHT AT THE SMALLEST PERCEIVED DEFENCE I WONDER IF THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY FROM MY FATHER TO SEE THINGS IF THERE IS THE ONLY LIVING PERSON IN THIS WORLD WHO CAN HELP IS SHELDEN WHEN THEIR MAM LEFT SHELDEN WAS NINE MY FATHER FIVE SHELDEN

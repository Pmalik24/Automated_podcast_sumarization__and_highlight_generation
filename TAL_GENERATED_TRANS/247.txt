THEY ARE MANAGED TO DAY IN OUR PROGRAMME WE SEE JUST HOW COMMON THIS IS WE AVE OTHER STORIES OF THIS HAPPENING SCARCE RY SOURCES THAT NEED TO GO TO SOMEBODY AND HOW THE END OF GETTING ALLICATED WHETHER THOSE RESEARCHES ARE PLACE TO STAY FOR THE NIGHT FOR LOVE AND COMPANIONSHIP BEING REDISTRIBUTED IN ALL KINDS OF NEW WAYS SINCE THE PANDEMIC BUT  BE EASY CHICAGO IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIFE I'M ER GLASS STAY WITH US A LON GOD COMMITTEE SO WE STARVER THIS EXAMPLE OF A VERY PURE SITUATION A PEOPLE HAVE BENG GIVEN THE DIFFICULT TASK OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DISTRIBUTE SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN FACT IN THIS CASE LIFE SAVING MEDICINE THER DECIDING BASICALLY WHO WILL LIVE OR DIE AND THE VERY IDEALISTIC SLUTION THEY CAME UP WITH LOLY SOLLIVAN TELLS STORY WUL START AS YOU MIEXPET WIT THE MEDICAL BREAK THROUP BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY AE DOCTOR NAME BELDING SCRIBNER HAD A PATION A YOUNG MAN WITH KIDNEY PROBLEMS TERE WAS OMETHING DOCTOR SCRIPNER HAD NO WAY TO TREAT SO WE HAD TO SEND THE GUY HOME TO HIS FAMILY TO DIE THE CASE HAUNTED DOCTOR SCRIPNER ONE NIGHT HE WOKE AP AT FOR IAM WITH AN IDEA AE WAY HE COULD HAVE SAVED THAT MAN AE TEPHLON TOO THAT COULD BE STITCHED INTO THE BLOOD VESSELS OF THE ARM AN STAY IN PLANTED THERE IT MADE LONG TERM DIALYSIS POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY'D PULLED THE BLOOD OUT OF SOME ONE'S BODY CLEAN IT THE WAY KIDNEY DOES AND PUT IT BACK IN TPEOPLE CALLED OT A MEDICAL MIRACLE AND ARTIFICIAL ORGAN THAT COULD CHEAT DEATH THERE WAS A PROBLEM THOUGH THE MACHINE THEY CAME UP WITH IS BIG AND COMPLICATED THEY BUILT IT FROM A SEERS RO BUCK FREEZER THAT THEY'D MODIFIED WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER PARTS TNURSES CALLED THE MACHINE THE MONSTER BECAUSE IT WAS SO BIG AND UNWEALTY AN EVERY PATIENT NEEDED TO SPEND DOZENS OF HOURS ACH WEEK CONNECTED TO IT AND ONLY FIVE OF THESE MACHINES EXISTED THIS IS ONLE EXSCERIMENTAL SAGES SO THEY ONLY TAKE CARE OF A FEW PEOPLE AND THEREWERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DYING FROM KIDNEY FAILURE EVERY YEAR IN THE COUN TRY SO ON ONE HAND A MIRACLE ON THE OTHER DOCTOR SCRIBNER HAD TRATED ONE HERROWING PROBLEM A MEDICAL ONE FOR AN EQUALLY HERROING ETHICAL PROBLEM HAD DO YOU CHOOSE WHICH FEW TO SAVE AND WHICH THOUSANDSE WOULD DIE DOCTOR SCRIBNERS OR TO GETTING FLOODED WITH REQUESTS FROM PEOPLE DESPERATE TO BE PUT ON THE MACHINE THE PRESSURE WAS CRUSHING HIN SAYING NO WAS ENSURING A PERSONS DEATH HE WENT TO THE ADMINISTRATORS WHO WERE HELPING TO OVERSEE THIS WHOLE PROJECT ANASKED FOR HELP THE ADMINISTRATORS TOOK IT FROM THERE THE FIRST THING THE ADMINISTRATORS SOCIDET IS YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ISN'T A MEDICAL DECISION AT ALL THIS IS A SOCIET OL DECISION SO THEY DECIDED TO ASSEMBLE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THEY CHOSE THESE PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAD ANY MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE OR REALLY ANY RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AT ALL THESE WERE ORDINARY PEOPLE HAND PICK TO REPRESENT A CROSS SECTION OF MORAL AMERICAN SOCIETY WY O MAE IILL TIRONI HER IA WARRER THIS IS FROM A DOCUMENTARY FROM NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE I Y BELERU I'M A HALF WHY I AM A PARGON THE MONEY ATONO BOOSERO COMINY O MEBLE MA MON OONO PLY O POOONA CIMEMACIN THE COMMITTE WAS STRICT ABOUT ANANIMITY THE DOCUMENT ARY THEIR HEADS ARE DARKENS WE CAN'T SEE THEIR FACES THESE PEOPLE HAD JUST BEEN GOING ABOUT THEIR LIVES WHEN THE DIALYSES CENTERS ADMINISTRATORS ASKED THEM TO COME IN ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE GROUP A YOUNG MINISTER TOLDTHEM IT WASN'T FOR HAN TO CHOS WHO WOULD LIVE AND DIE THE DOCTOR SAID WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU TO DECIDE WHO WILL DIE THIS IS ALL READY DETERMEN WE ARE ASKING YOU TO HELP DECIDE WHO WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXTENDED LIFE THE MINISTER AGREE TO DO IT THEY ALL DID A FEW OF THEM SAID IT WOULD BE TOO CRUEL TO FORCE THIS RESPONSIBILITY ON TO SOME ONE ELSE OFFICIALLY THEY WERE CALLED THE ADMISSIONS AND POLICYES COMMITTEE OF THE SEATL ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY CENTER AT SWEETISH HOSPITAL BUT A LOT PEOPLE CALLED THEM THE GOD COMMITTY WAT THE TIME AGAIND THIS IS IN NINETEEN SIXTY THERE WAS NO BLUE PRINT FOR THIS THE DOCTORS GAVE THEM NO GUIDE LINES THE COMMITEE CONSIDERED FIRST COM FIRST SERVE OR DRAWING STRAS BHUT THEY BEEN TOLD TO USE THEIR CONSCIENCES SO THEY CAME UP WITH SET OF PRINCIPLES AND RULES THE FIRST RULES WERE CLEAR CUT THE TREATMENT WAS IN SIATLE SO THEY'AD ONLY LOOK AT APPLICANTS WHO LIVED IN WASHINGTON STATE WASHINGTON TACXPAERS WERE FUNDING THE RESEARCH THEY ALSO DECIDED NO ONE OVER FORTY FIVE THERE COULD BE MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS A D THOSE PEOPLE HAD AT LEAST HAD A SHOT AT LIFE AND NO ONE UNDER EIGHTEEN THE TREATMEN WAS PHYSICALLY IN A MOTIONALLY DEMANDING NO ONE KNEW HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT KIDS BUT THOSE RULES ONLY GOT THEM SO FAR THEY DECIDED THEY'D BASE THEIR FINAL SELECTION ON SOMETHING ELSE SOCIAL WORTH THEYD TRIED TO SAVE THE PERSON WHOSE DEATH WOULD MOST HURT SOCIETY THEY MADE A LIST OF THE FACTORS THEY'D WAY MARITAL STATUS NUMBER OF DEPENDENTS INCOME THAT WORTH TO PAY FOR THE TREATMEN  SAX EDUCATION OCCUPATION A MOTIONAL STABILITY PASS PERFORMANCE FUTURE PETENTIAL AND PERSONAL REFERENCES THEY MADE A POLICY OF NEVER MEETING ANY OF THE CANDIDATES AN PERSON OR EVEN KNOWING THEIR NAMES TECAUSE DENYING A PERSON YOU'D MET FACE TO FACE SEEMED TOO HARD THEY ONCE LET A JOURNALIST COME SEE HOW THEY MADE ONE OF THESE DECISIONS THEY JUST HAD A MEETING WHERE THE DOCTORS HAD PRESENTED THEM WITH FIVE ABLIGATIONS TAND THE COMMITTEE COULD ONLY PIC TWO THEY WALK THE JOURNALIST THROUGH HOW THEY MADE THAT CHOICE TREDERY CREATE FOR HER THE CONVERSATION THEY JUST HAD HERE'S A TRANSCRIPT OF THEIR DISCUSSION TBANKER  JUST TO GET THE BALL ROLLING WHY DON'T WE START WITH NUMBER ONE THE HOUSEWIFE FROM LALLAWALLA SURGEON THIS PATIENT COULD NOT COMMUTE FOR THE TREATMENT FROM AURRALLA SO SHE WOULD HAVE TO FIND AWAY TO MOVE HER FAMILY TO SEATTLE BANKER EXACTLY MY POINT IT SAYS HERE THAT OUR HUSBAND HAS NO FUNDS TO MAKE SUCH A MOVE LAWYER THEN ARE YOU PROPOSING WE ELIMINATE THIS CANDIDATE ON THE GROUNDS THAT SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY ACCEPT TREATMENT IF IT WERE OFFERED MINISTER HOW CAN WE COMPARE A FAMILY SITUATION OF TWO CHILDREN SUCH AS THIS WOMAN IN WALLAWALLA WIT THE FAMILY OF SIX CHILDREN SUCH AS PATIENT UMBER FOUR THE AIR CRAFT WORKER THIS IS SOMETHING THEY TALK ABOUT A LOT I'VE ONE CANDIDATE HAS ONE KID AND THE OTHER IS TWO SHOULD YOU PICK THE CANDIDATE WITH TWO KIDS THEY GO ROUND AND ROUND TRY TO ANSWER A QUESTION THAT HAS NO ANSER LABOUR LEADER FOR THE CHILDREN'S SAKE WE'VE GOT A RECKON WITH THE SURVIVING PARENTS OPPORTUNITY TO REMARRY AND A WOMAN WITH THREE CHILDREN HAS A BETTER CHANCE TO FIND A NEW HUSBAND THEN A VERY YOUNG WIDOW WITH SIX CHILDREN SURGEON HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY BE SURE OF THAT HOW THE REST OF YOU FEEL ABOUT NUMBER THREE THE SMALL BUSINESS MAN WITH THREE CHILDREN I'M IMPRESSD THAT HIS DOCTOR TOOK SPECIAL PAINS TO MENTION THAT THIS MAN IS ACTIVE IN CHURCHWORT THIS IS AN INDICATION TO ME OF CHARACTER AND MORAL STRENGTH HOUSEWIFE WHUCD JUST CERTAINLY HELP HIM CONFORM TO THE DEMANDS OF THE TREATMENT LAWYER IT WOULD ALSO HELP THEM TO ENDURE A LINGERING DEATH HOUSEWIFE IF WER STILL LOOKING FOR THE MEN AT THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL OF SERVICE TO SOCIETY I THINK WE MUST CONSIDER THAT THE CHEMISTS AND THE ACCOUNT HAVE THE FINEST EDUCATIONAL BACK GROUNDS OF ALL FIVE CANDIDATES IN THE END THE PEOPLE THEY CHOSE WERE MOSTLY MEN WHITE AND WELL OFF PEOPLE LIKE THEM WHICH SEEMS INEVITABLE GIVEN THE CRETERIA THEY'D COME UP WITH THE SELECT FOR WHAT THEY CALLED SOCIAL WORTH EDUCATION FUTURE PETENTIAL INCOME THE TREATMENT COST ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DAY AND IT OFTEN WASN'T COVERED BY INSURANCE THEY'D WRITTEN ALL TESE RULES TO TRY TO BE FAIR BUT THEY'D CREATED AN OUTCOME THAT WAS ANYTHING BUT SOMETIMES WHEN YU TRY TO GUESS YOUR OWN BIACEES YOU COME UP WITH THA VERY INCOMPLETE LIST IN A LETTER THE MINISTER ROW A FEW YEARS LATER HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE'D BEEN EXTRA CAREFUL TO GUARD AGAINST HIS OWN BIACES AND NOT FAVOUR PEOPLE WHO WERE GOOD CHURCH MEMBERS THE LATER ON HE WORRIED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GONE TOO FAR THEY UNFAIRLY HARD ON RELIGIOUS PEOPLE THE FINAL THOUGHITS WERE ALWAYS MADE BY CONSENSES THEY SAID THAT GAVE THEM SOME COMFORT  O BUT    O A W THE         WITH A WE WE AR RAR A BOR BUT COMITY A UT E BO CHOI A WI FOR TO MAOR AS HOR TO FIND MANHY RECORDINGS OF DOCTOR SCRIBNER UT I FOUND AN ORAL HISTORY RECORDED DECATES AFTER ALL THIS HAPPENED WERE HE

WALK WELL ENOUGH THE PEOPLE CAN'T TELL HE EVER HAD AN INTERY HE WAS TOT SEEM HOW HE USED TO BE IT'S SO HIVE FROM TOPEN A WATER BOTTLE PRECANED A LIKE BOLL  JUST DOWN HE WAS A FILL TEMPERATURE AT ALL SO WE CAN FILL THE WATER FROM THE SHARER HID HIN BUT  CAN'T O A HOTTED I AND THEN LIKE MY FINGERS AI CAN FEEL WHEN THE'R TOUCHING THINGS BUT LIKE I CAN'T ALWAYS FEEL THE TEXTURE SO WHEN I' LIKE REACHING FOR SOMETHING IN MY POCKET I DON'T ALWAYS KNOW IF I'M GRABING MY WALLET OR MY KEYS OR JUST THE PANTS LIKE IT'S IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT BUT I DO HAVE SENSATION EVERYWHERE I JUST FAIRIES THE LEVEL BUT I'S INTERESTING THAT LIKE YOU ARE SO RECOVERIS BUT YOU'RE NOT TOTALLY THERE LIKE YOU'VE COME SO FAR BUT DO NOT TEL E THERE YOU'RE IN THIS WEARD WENBOL IT IS WEARD I'VE NOT YOUR HOW MUCH I LIKE IT I JUST WANT ALL THIS TO BE DONE I JUST WANT THE RECOVERY YO BE DINE WHETHER I FULLY RECOVER OR NOT I JUST WONT TO BE AT THE POINT WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO SPEND MY TOT DEDICATE MY ENTIRE LIFE TO GETTING BETTERS LIKE THE POINT I EX SUPER EXCITED TO GET TO IS WHEN I NOT THINKING ABOUT IT WHERE WHERE IS RIGHT NOW EVERY TIME WOVH MY HAND IT'S JUST IN MY HEAD O LIFE I HAVE THIS INJURY EVERY TIME WITH MY LEG ALL I HAVE THIS ENJURY TAT'S TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE HE'S USED TO WHAT HIS BODY CAN DO AT WHATEVER LEVEL THAT TURNS OUT TO BE IT IS WHAT THIS DOMINATING HIS THOUGHTS AN IS WHOLD DAY BUT THIS IS THE THING RECOVERY MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY EACH PERSON SETS ER OWN GOLDS PART OF RECOVERING IS ACTALLY TO FINDING FOR YOURSELF WHAT YOUR OWN RECOVERY MEANS TO DANA PROGRAMME WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING BACK FROM SOME VERY DIFFERENT THINGS THE'RE IN THE SAME WIMBOW CHASES IN WHERE THERE PARTLY THERE BUT NOT ALL THE WAY THER IN THE MIDDLE WHICH IS THIS MOMENT OF ENORMOUS HOPE BUT ALSO A LOT OF OTHER STUFF TO  BE EASY CHICAGO SINCE MERICAN LIFE AM MI REGLASS STILL WITH US S AONE NAKED LUNCH SO T I THEY SHOW REALLY CAME OUT OF A QUESTION THAT ONE OF A LONG TIME PRODUCERS A SUSAN BURTON HAD ABOUT SOMETHING HIS HAPPENING IN HER OWN LIFE YOU MAY REMEMBER A FEW MONTHS AGO SUSAN I TOLD STORY AN I SHOW ABOUT HER EATING DISORDER AND I WAS SOMETHING SHE HAD KEPT SECRET FOR MEST OF A LIFE FROM EVERY ONE IN HER LIFE AND AND THEN SHEU REVEAL THE SECRET IN A BOOKSHIEBO THIS MEMOIR THAT CAME OT LAST SUMMER AND THE BOK IS ABUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE ANEATING DISORDER NOT ABOUT HOW TO GET OVER ONE AS WICH SHISN' WROTIT SHE WAS NOT OVER IT SHE STILL ISN'N AND OF THE TOON HAVE YEARS THAT SHE 'S BEEN WORKING TOWARD RECOVERY SHE STARTED TO WONDER LIKE WHAT DOES RECOVERY FROM AN EATING DISORDER EVEN MEAN I HADS UP THAT IF HEARING STORIES BY EATING DISORDERS AGGRAVATE YOUR OWN ETING DISORTER SOMETIMESIS MAY AFFECT YOU A HE SUSN IT THE BEGINNING OF RECOVERY I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT RECOVERY WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS TELLING MY SECRET THE SECRET WAS THE EATING DISORDER I'D HAVE FOR THIRTY YEARS WHAT WAS THE SEETING TOSORDER IT HAD BEEN SO MANY THINGS STARVING BENGING IT'S NOT LIKE YOU PICK IN EATING DISORDER AS A TEAN AGE GIRL AND YOU HAVE THAT ONE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE THE THAP RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD IS WHAT YOU HAVE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE  WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO ME I WAS GOING TO HAVE WHEN IT AGE FORTY FIVE I STEPPED INTO MY THERAPISTS OFFICE FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M PREOCCUPIED WITH FOOD AND I DON'T WANT TO BE I TOLD HER THAT WAS THE BEGINNING NI AM IN THE MIDDLE TO AN A HALF YEARS IN AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT ISN'T EASY TO SUMMARISE EASY WOULD BE I NOW DO EX BEHAVIOUR INSTEAD OF WIE I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF SENTENCE BUT I DO HAVE EXAMPLES LIKE THIS ONE WONE AFTERNOON IN THIS SPRING MY HUSBAND MADE COOKIES I TOOK ONE FROM THE COOLING RACK AND I ATE IT WITH HIM IND OUR SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SUN MAYBE THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SMALLTHING MAYBE THAT SOUNDS LIKE NOTHING I'VE TO CURB THAT IMPULSE TO TELL YOU HOW SMALL THESE THINGS ARE HOW NOTHING THEY ARE BECAUSE WITHIN EATING DISORDER HOW YOU RELATE TO FOOD CONNECTS TO AND DISRUBS HOW YOU RELATE TO EVERYONE IN YOUR LIFE AND EATING SOMETHING SWEET AT THAT TIME OF DAY FROR ME THAT'S NOT NOTHING THAT HAVENS ALONE IN SECRET BECAUSE THE PLEASURE IS SO INTENSE IT CANNOT BE SEEN IT CANNOT BE SHARE THERE WILL BE NO PLEASURE IF ITS SHARE BUT THAT DAY I LEAN AGAINST THE COUNTER AND ATE THE COOKIY AND IT FELT GOOD IT WAS ONE OF SO MANY THINGS I DIDN'T REALIZE ABOUT RECOVERY IT'S NOT JUST EATING INTUITIVELY IT'S MAKING FOOD SOMETHIN SHARED INSTEAD OF SOMETHING SECRET ANOTHER DIY MY OTHER SUN AGE THIRTEEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN HE WANTED ME TO COME OUT TO THE GARDEN SO HE COULD SHOW ME HOW THE VINES OF HIS CUCUMBERS WERE HARDENING AS THEY TWINE HE WANTED TO SHOW ME NOW AND IT COULDN'T BE NOW HOW COULD ANY ONE BE ASKING ME TO DO ANYTHING NOW I COULDN'T NO IN A SECOND AND YEU WENT BACK OUTSIDE BUT THE REASON I COULDN'T WAS THAT I JUST PITTED CHERRIES THAT I WAS GOING TO PUT ON ICE CRANE THE FOOD WAS INCOMING ON THE WAY IT COULD NOT BE STOPPED I COULD NOT BE INTRUDED ON WHEN I FINISHED I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE GARDEN AND MY SUN SHOWED ME THE VINES IT STOOD THEYRE HATING MYSELF REFLECTING ON HOW MANY SUCH MOMENTS THERE HAVE BEEN OVER THE YEARS I CAN'T WRITE NOW NOT WRIGHT NOW I'VE DON A LOT OF THAT LIKE A LOT OF MOTHERS AND A LOT OF IT HAS HAD TO DO WITH WORK BUT WORK COME ON REALLY THERE'S NO SHAME IN THAT ADMISSION ERE'S ALL THIS HAND RINGING ABOUT GUILT AND WORK AND MOTHERHOOD BUT HARD WORK IS LIKE THE MOST CULTURALLY SANCTIONED THING IN AMERICA TRY REVEALING THAT YOU'VE TURNED YOUR CHILD AWAY BECAUSE OF FOOD DO YOU DETECT ANGER MOST OF US WITH EATING DISORDERS VULCANICALLY ANGRY ALSO MOST OF US PLACID OR EVEN FUN GIRL DISGUISED THAT'S PART OF RECOVERY TOO EXPRESSING ANGER NOT HIDING TMY BODY MY BODY IS RECOVERING TOO IT'S CHANGING I BODIES LIKE THOSE SPONGES MY CHILDREN AIS WANTED WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG AND WE WERE IN LINE AT THE GROCERY STORE THIT'S PONGE IS OURE THIN LIKE STICKS OF GUM THE COLOR OF MANILLA ENVELOPES WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN WATER THEY EXPAND THAT'SWHAT MY BODY HAS DONE IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE FLAT SPONGES THAT EXPANDED I TOLD US TO MY THERAPIST BHAT S AN INTERESTING WORD FLAT SHE SAID IT'STHE WORD I MEAN I EMPHASIZED FLAT NOT THIN YES SHE SAID AND YOU WERE FLAT INSIDE TOO A MOTIONALLY AND THAT WAS TRUE THAT'S WHAT THE EATING DISORDER DOES TO YOU THAT'S PART OF WY YOU HAVE IT SO YOU WON'T FEEL THAT'S MAYBE THE WHOLE POINT CLOTHES A BLUE LINEN DRESS WITH BUTTONS DOWN THE FRONT THERE CAME A DAY AN MAY WHEN IT WAS THE RIGHT WEATHER FOR IT I PUT ON THE DRESS WHICH USED TO BE LOOSE BUT NO LONGER WAS BUT THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE LOOSE IND THE KITCHEN MY HUSBAND REACHE FOR ME HE PUT HIS HANDS ON MY WAIST ROUNDED THEM OVER MY HIXE AND I WANTED IT I WANTED TO BE TOUCHED THAT WAS NEW TOO BUT THE WAY I'VE GAINED THE WAI O CASE SO THIS IS MIXED SOME OF IT IT'S NOT THE BINGING I DID FOR YEARS BUT THER'S BEEN A LOT OF REACHING FOR FOOD ALL DAY I LONGED TO EAT IN AN ORDERLY WAY LIKE MEALS ON PLATES AT CONSISTENT TIMES BUT I STRUGGLE TO DO SO THERE'S A SPECIFIC MEAL THAT COMES TO MINE WHEN I THINK ABOUT NOT ONLY WHERE I AM IN RECOVERY BUT WHAT I WANT FROM IT I WANTED BE NORMAL ABOUT LUNCH WANT ANO THE SCENE I ASSOCIATE WITH LUNCH ARE THIS AMERICAN LIFE S TAFF MEETING WHICH HAPPENS IN PERSEON ONCE A WEEK WHEN THERE'S NOT A PANDEMIC EVERY WEEK FOOD IS ORDERED IN AND LAID OUT ON HE TABLE AND TAKE OUT CONTAINERS I'VE NEVER ONCE TAKEN THE FOOD WE ORDER IN FOR THIS MEETING FOR YEARS I'VE WATCHED PEOPLE PICK UP PLATES AN JUST PUT FOOD ON THOSE PLATES AND THEN SIT DOWN AT THE MEETING AND EAT THAT FOOD WHILE WE ARE TALKI EVERY PART OF THIS IS A MARVEL TO ME BUT ACTUALLY WHATD HAPPENS EVEN BEFORE THEY GET TO THE FOOD THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART THAT THEY STOOD FROM THEIR DESKS AND CAME TO GET THE FOOD NEITHER HEATING THEMSELVES FOR ARDY HAVING EATEN AT THE WRONG TIME NOR BRUTTLE AND EMPTY BECAUSE THEY BEEN TOO SCARED TO PUT ANYTHING IN I IMAGINE HUNGER RISING IN A NORMAL WAY IN THEIR BODIES A KIND OF RISING HUNGER THATS SO UNFAMILIAR IT'S LIKE I CRAVE IT IN THE WAY PEOPLE MAY BE CRAVE LOVE OR TOUCH OR SOMETHING IT HAPPENE SO RARELY FOR ME THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT WHEN I SIT IN A CIRCLE OF CO WORKERS WITH PLATES ON THEIR LAPS I'M LOOKING AT THESE PEOPLE AN IMAGINING WHAT THEY FEEL IN THEIR BODIES IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY DISTANT FROM THEM IN A WAY THATS KIND OF FAR REACHING AS IN IT EXTENDS OUT TO OTHER WAYS I RELATE TO MY CO WORKERS AND EVERY ONE IN MY LIFE SO YET IN RECOVERY I WANTED BE NORMAL ABOUT LUNCH NORMAL WE ALL KNOW THERE IS NO NORMAL THAT NORMAL IS BEING FASED OUT BUT NORMAL STAYS IN MY HEAD WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD NORMAL ABOUT FOOD IS THAT RECOVERY WHEN MY BOOK CAME OUT AND I WAS FIRST DOING INTERVIEWS ABOUT IT PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME WHERE ARE YOU WITH FOOD NOW I WOULD SAY I'M WORKING TOWARD RECOVERY BUT I FELT SO UNEASY WHENEVER I SAID THIS THELT LIKE I WAS THROWING AROUND A PHRASE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AND THAT MY IGNORANCE WAS CLEAR TO EVERYONE WHO ACTUALLY KNEW ABOUT EATING DISORDER F RECOVERY I JUST FELT SO OUT OF MY DEBTH JUST SO NEW TO THIS TO EVERY PART OF IT TO THE WORKING TOWARD AT PART TO RECOVERY WHICH JUST TO SAY WAS THAT THE PROCESS OR THE END WAS THERE AN END WHAT DOES RECOVERY FROM AN EATING DISORDER EVEN MEAN SQUARE ONE I WENT LOOKING FOR THE OFFICIAL CLINICAL DEFINITION OF EATING DISORDER F RECOVERY I WANTED THIS IS CONTECT AS A BASELINE BUT IT TURNED OUT THERE WAS NO BASE LINE THERE'S NO CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT RECOVERY MEANS MOST STDEFINITIONS INCLUDE PHYSICAL CRITERIA LIKE ARE YOU AT HEALTHY WEIGHT AND BEHAVIOUR LIKE HAVE YOU STOPPED BENGING BUT THERE'S ALSO HOW MUCH YOUR THINKING ABOUT FOOD YOURE ABILITY TO EXPRESS EMOTIONS ALL THE STUFF THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EATING THIS IS WHERE THE LACK OF CONSENSES COMES IN OVER WHAT OTHER STUFF BELONGS IN THE DEFINITION INTELECTUALLY I WAS INTERESTED IN ALL OF THIS BUT A MOTIONALLY WHAT I REALLY WANTED WAS TO TALK ABOUT RECOVERY WITH PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN THROUGH IT PEOPLE FURTHER ALONG IN IT THAN ME I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT RECOVERY FELT LIKE TO THEM MAYBE IS A WAY OF IMAGINING MYSELF AN TO MY OWN VERSION OF IT AND I HAD TWO PEOPLE IN MINE THE FIRST ONE WAS SOMEONE WHO'D SAID A SINGLE WORD TO ME ABOUT RECOVERY THAT CAPTURED HOW I WANTED TO FEEL THERE A WORD THAT I'D BEEN RETURNING TO FOR MONTHS THE WORD WAS STURDY I VERY HAPPY TO BE TALKING YOU AGAIN I CA GOT ME TO IF YOUARE I DON'T KNOW UNDER THIRDY AND YOU GREW UP WATCHING TE COLODIAN YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHO GENETTE A CURTIOUS SHE WAS A STARVED TEAN COMEDIES I CARLEY SAMMON CAT IN HER EARLY TWENTY SHE QUIT ACTING IT WAS ACTUALLY PART OF HER EATING DISORDERF RECOVERY AND IW SHE HAS A PODCAST CALLED EMPTY INSIDE SHE INTERVIEWED ME FOR IT LAST SUMMER WHICH IS WHEN SHE SAID THAT WORD STURDY THAT STAYED WITH ME EVERSINCE FIRST AND MOST OF WHY I FELT STURIED AFTER I RECOVERY THAT I COULD SHARE MY STORY SO WHEN WE SPOKE YOU USE THIS WORD TO DESCRIBE YOUR RECOVERY YOU SAID YOU WAITED TO TELL YOUR STORY UNTIL YOU WERE STURDY AS SOON AS YOU SAID THAT WORD LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT IT GRABBED ME AND THEN WHEN I RESPONDED TO YOU I EVEN LIKE REPEATED THE WORD KIND OF TRYING IT OUT LIKE IT JUST SHOWS A LOT OF SELF KNOWLEDGE TO YOU THAT YOU WAITED TILL YOU APPOINT WHERE YOU WERE LIKE STURDY CAUSE OF COURSE AND IT STAY WITH ME AFTER THE INTERVIEU AND I THINK LIKE IT HAD SO MUCH SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE I'M IT DESCRIBED TO ME BOTH AN EMOTIONAL AND LIKE A PHYSICAL PLACE I HAD YOU KNOW FOR SO LONG PRIVILEGED AND TRIED FOR FRAILNESS IN FRAGILITY AND SO LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING STURDY WAS LIKE SUDDENLY APPEALING TO ME LIKE A STURDY BODY BUT MALSO LIKE STURDINESS IN THE WAY THAT LIKE YOU COULD BE BUFFETED BY THAD MI LIKE THE HARD EXPERIENCES COME OUT O CET LIKE YOU COULD WITHSTAND IT LIKE YOU MIGHT GET LIKE BLOWN ABOUT BUT YOU WOULDN'T GET BROKEN YOU WOULD BE O KAY AND AND I THINK AS FAR AS LIKE THINKING ABOUT MY RECOVERY IT'S BEEN IN INTERESTING WORD TO RETURN TO BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE AS WOO WOO AND SOME OTHER STUFF LIKE PHOENIX RISING OR THE TIGER YE YOU KNAEN LIT YOU HAS SOMETHING REALLY REAL ABOUT IT ANYWAY OH MY GOD I GEX CORMEN CURE WITDS THURTY WEEDS TO YOU WELL I MA I JUST HAVE TO SAY I ANY TIME ONBY STARTS LIKE COMPARING PEOPLE THE ANIMALS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW TO THE THE LYONMISS PROWLS AND THE NIGHT SKY I LIKE YOU LOST ME I HAVE THERE'S NOTHING REAL THAT I CAN GRAB ON TO SO FOR ME IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO USE LANGUAGE THAT CIND OF REFLECTS REALITY OTHERWISE I WHAT STURDY MEANT TO GENET WAS THAT SHE FELT STRONG ENOUGH IN HER RECOVERY TO SPEAK PUBLICLY ABOUT HER EATING DISORDER WITHOUT FALLING BACK INTO IT AND TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT SHE HAD TO RECOVER FROM HER EATING DISORTOF STARTED WHEN SHE WAS ELEVEN AND BEING A CHILD ACTOR I ALWAYS PLAYED ROLES THAT WERE KIND OF YOUNGER THEND MY ACTUAL AGE AND IT WAS VERY BENEFICIAL TO BE ABLE TO PLAY ROLES OR YOUNGER THAN MY AGE BECAUSE YOU COULD WORK LONGER HOURS SO THEY WERE MUCH MORE INCLINED TO CAST YOU IF YOU WERE TWELVE PLAYING EIGHT THAN IF YOU WERE EIGHT PLANGY AND BUT WHEN I WAS ELEVEN I SORT OF STARTED DEBOLOPING A LITTLE TIMY I'LL CALL IT IT NIPPLE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO CALL IT LIKE JUST A LITTLE LIKE THE LITTLEST PEEP OF AREST AND AND MY MOND HAD ACTUALLY HAD CANCER WHEN I WAS TWO YEARS OLD SO I THOUGHT THE ONLY THING I KNEW ABOUT LUMPS AND BREAST WAS WITHOUT MY CANCER SO I THOUGHT OH NO SHE HAD CANCER NOW I HAVE CANCER I SHOWED MY MON THIS LUNP SHE FELT IT AND SHE SAID OH NEDTY KNO YOU DON'T HAVE CANCER YOURE GETTING YOU'RE JUST GETTING BREASTS AND IN MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD MINE BREASTS WERE JUST ABOUT AS BAD AS CANCER TRULY I DID NOT WANT TO BE OLDER I DIDN'T MI KNEW THAT THAT WOULD BE YOU KNW REALLY REALLY NOT GOOD FOR MY ACTING CAREER AND I WAS LARGELY THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR MY FAMILYES I KNEW THEM MEANT BAT THINGS FOR MY FAMILY I JUST WANTED TO STAY YOUNG AND SO I SAID WELL HOW CAN I HOW CAN I KEEP THE BOOBS FROM COMING IN MY MUMPSAID WHELE THERE'S THIS THING CALLED CALLRIA FICTION JU NETTE ACTUALLY WROTE A SONG ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION IT'S FROM A ONE WOMAN SHOW SHE'S BEEN PERFORMING   S LIS  AND FROM THAT POINT ON SHE SHE NOT ONLY COACH ME BUT REALLY OU KNOW SHED HAD EATING DISORTERS OF HER OWN TE QUITE A LONG TIME SO WE WERE SORT OF THIS I CALL IT LIKE A MOMMY IN ME EATING DISORDER OF TEAM AND WE WERE JUST YOU KNOW WE'D HELP EACH OTHER OUT EVERY SINGLE MY MEAL PLANNING FOR THE NEXT DAY CALORY CALRY COUNTING FOR THE PR FOR THE DAY THAT WE JUST EXPERIENCE AND AND SWAPPING TIPS AND TRICKS AND READING WOMAN'S WORLD MAGAZIN DI OT AGES TOGETHER AND WOU WERE JUST YOU KNOW I TOUGH IT WAS THIS VALULOUS THANGWHERE WHERE YO WERE JUST THIS LITTLE DOELL WHEN I THOUGHT WHILE I'M SO LUCKY MY MUMPS HELPING ME WITH THIS THING I'M HELPING HER LOOK AT US GO L   THE IDEA OF GOING OVER THE CALORIES FOR YOUR DAY WITH YOUR MOTHER A MEANT YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE  I MADE LIKE LITTLE LISTS OF LIKE YOU KNO TWO HUNDRED PLUS ONE FIFTY PLEN BUTE BUT IT WAS SO ALONE I MEAN MY GOD THAT YOU ERE EING IT WITH YOUR MOTHER AH YEH ABSOLUTELY I MAY I THINK I THINK DI MI THE EXPERIENCE OF EATINGS FOR SO OFTEN IS SOMETHING THAT SO LONELY IM AND WHILE IT BECAME THAT FOR ME AFTER MY MONBIT AND AND THE EATING WORDS WHICH TO BLEEMA FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE TIME THAT I HAD NTER I SAET IT WAS VERY MUCH THAT TEAMS FOR WAS THERE LIKE A MOMENT WORD LIKE A STAGE WHERE YOU  STARTED USING THE WORD RECOVERY TO DESCRIBE YOURE EXPERIENCED YOURSELF WELL GI WOUD CAN IT RI ROT LIKE A LITTLE BOT ABOUT WOOO ORD WORDS EARLIER BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING ACTUALLY IN RECOVERY THAT DIDN'T I DID NOT LIKE IT OT A WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE WORD RECOVERY I THOUGHT ITS SOMEBODY IN HEAD TO TO LINEN JUST YOUON EACH WAVES LIKE GRANNING EAR TO EAR LAUGHING ABOUT HOW EASO I I PIGGING UP A SEA SHELL AND LIKE TOSSING IT INTO THE SEA THAT WAS NOT HOW I FELT ABOUT LIKE OR IT WAS SURE I WOULD EVER EVER FEEL ABOUT LIFE SO I WAS VERY WEARY OF USING THE WORD AND RECOVERY AND FER FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND I WOULD SAY A KIND OF I JUST TRY TO BUY PAST THAT AND AND USE OTHER WORDS AND TER TO THINK OF WHAT I SAID YOU KDON'I WOULD JUST I WOUD JUST GOINE TO BE I WOUSD SAY YOU KNOWS SOMETHING SOMETHING I'M WORKING ON MIDWAY THROUGH SHE GOT TO A POINT THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE WHERE I AM NOW SHE DESCRIBES THE FEELING THIS WAY I'VE BEEN IN RECOVERY FOR A FEW YEARS AND I'M NOT WHERE I WANT TO BE THIS HAS BEEN VERY STOPPED AND GO HAD'S BEEN VERY GOOD WEEK BAD WEEK I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT I MY WANTED I WANTED MEAN A WAKE UP TO MORROW AND AN WORK TOWARD BEING FULLY RECOVERED I THINK IT'S TIME AND AND AND I AND I FELT READY YE SO AT THAT POINT I MEAN BECAUSE IM YOU KNOW AMONG THE REASONS I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ITS BECAUSE YOU ARE LIKE AS SOMEBODY WHO DISLIKES THE PHRASE RECOVERY JOURNEY SMY J YOU BUT YOU ARE FURTHER ALONG THAT LIKE BESOME NI THE PAGE IN YOUR LINEN DRESS THAN THAN I AM IM AND I AM I FEEL REALLY READY TO A TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS IM SO FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHOS LISTENING TO YOU TELL THIS STORY AND IS LIKE I HAVE THAT THOUGHT TO I WANT TO PUT IT BEHIND ME SO LIKE WHAT HOW WERE YOU ABLE LIKE WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT THAT GOT YOU TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW SJEANETTE'S ANSWER TO MY QUESTION ABOUT WHAT SHE DID NEXT WAS ESSENTIALLY IT WASN'T WHAT SHE DID NEXT THAT MATTERED IT WAS ALL THE WORK SHE'D AREADY DONE AND THERE BE SHE GRAMBLED WITH A LOT OF THE UNDER LYING REASONS FOR HER EATING DISORDER FELT RAGE TOWARD HER MOTHER GREEVED HER MOTHER YES SHE WAS STILL PURGING AND STILL RESTRICTING BUT WAYWAY LESS SHE JUST KNEW THAT SHE DIDN'T NEED THOSE BEHAVIOURS AS COPING STRATEGIES ANY MORE SHE DEVELOPED OTHERS SHE STARTED WRITING FINDING HER OWN VOICE THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO SHE DESCRIBES WHERE SHE IS NOW AS RECOVERED HOW DOES LIKE THE REALITY OF OF FEELING RECOVERED LIKE HOW DOES IT COMPARE WITH WHAT YOU IMAGINE O MY GOD IT FEELS LHIKE THERE'S NOT THAT WEIT CONSTANTLY AND AND WHILE I WOULD SAY YOU K O THE DEFINILLY A AFAR AFAR DISTANCE FROM LIKE PECE WHATEVER YOU KNOW IT'S ANOTHER ONE MAVRE WORDS FOR ME BUT I BUT I FEEL GOOD I FEEL AM SHE FEELS MORE PRESENT I FEEL MORE ABLE TO FOCUS MORE ABLE TO FEEL HER FEELINGS AND TO TOLERATE THE UNCOMFORTABLE ONES THESE ARE ALL THINGS I HOPE FOR LIKE PRECISELY I ASKED HER ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT SOME WEIRD IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD AN EATING DISORDER BUT I FEEL FOOD IN MY BODY JUST INTENSELY JEANETT SAID SHE UNDERSTOOD ONE THOUSAND PER CENT WHAT I MEANT BY THIS AND SHE SAID THAT'S GONE NOW TOO IT'S LIKE I'M MORE INTUNE WITH MY BODY YEA BUT LESS AWARE OF THOSE TYPES OF THINKGS TALKING TO JEANETTE IT MADE ME THINK OF A TURM MIGHT COME ACROSS IN THE RESEARCH I DONE ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF RECOVERY INDISTINGUISHABLE AS IN A PERSON CAN RECOVERY SO FULLY FROME AN EATING DISORDER THAT THEY BECOME IN DISTINGUISHABLE FROM SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER HAD ONE IT SOUNDED ALMOST SIDEPHI LIKE WE ARACE YOUR EATING DISORDER BUT ALSO YOUR OLD IDENTITY LIKE NOT EVEN SOMETHNG I WOULD WANT BUT ALSO SOMETHING I INSTANTLY WANTED I THOUGHT ID TRY OUT IN DISTINGUISHABLE ON JEANETTE SEE IF IT RESINATED UT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE FROM THEM AND SOMEBODY WHO'S NEVER HAD AN EATING DISORDER LIKE THERE BRAIN AS INDISTINGUISHABLE IS LOVE TA I YOU DETRI NA THAI BUT SIS THAT DOES THAT A IT IS  SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS A PEELING TO YOU LIKE AS THAT WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU FEEL INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S NEVER HAD AN EATING DISORDER THAT'S HUE THATS HUGELY APPEELING I THINK IM YOU NOT BELYING OF I IF I IF I SAID THERE WASN'T ALWAYS KIND OF SOME AWARENESS OF THAT BEING MY PASS E AM BUT I WOULD S I DEVINITLY LIKE NOTICE WHEN SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF EATING DISORERTEN LIKE I FEE LIKE I CAN I SPOUGHT THEM QUITE EASILY LIKE OH OW THEY BE JUST ER AR NONAL IS KONT OF MI MY THOUGHT AND I WOULD SAY I'M I'M AS CLOSE TO THAT AS I CAN POSSIBLY BE I HAVE MENOS ER FOO RULES I EATE AM YOU KNOW WHATEVER I WANT BREAKFAST LUNCH DINNERS NACKS AND AM AND I DON'T THINK AT ALL ABOUT IT IT'S I I IT'S ITS ITS ALMOST ODD TO ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT MIGHT PASSE I I I'VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES TO MY PARTNER ALSI LE I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A TIME MY LIFE WHEN THAT WAS WHO I WAS LIKE I I YA IT'S SO WILD TO ME IT'S JUST IT FEELS LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON IT FEELS LIKE OMAN I GET THEY DOES FEELIKE MY BRAIN WAS WY AR DIFFERENTLY THEM I FELT HOPEFUL AFTER TALKING TO JEANETT LIKE THE FREEDOM SHE FEELS THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME HERE WAS SOME ONE WHO THOUGHT THOUGHTS LIKE MINE WHO FELT FEELINGS IN HER BODY LIKE MINE WHO NOW HAD NEW THOUGHTS AND A NEW EXPERIENCE OF HER BODY BUT I'VE HAD THESE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS FOR A LOT LONGER TIME I'M FORTY SEVEN JEANETTE JUST TURNED TWENTY NINE WON OF THE REALITIES OF MY RECOVERY IS JUST THAT I'VE LIVED WITH AN EATING DISORDER FOR SO MANY YEARS AND I REALLY WANTED TO TALK TO SOME ONE MY OWN AGE WHO'D STARTED RECOVERY IN MIDDLE AGE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT HAD BEEN LIKE FOR THE I HAD SOME ONE IN MINE TWHOAN NISSA GRAY AN NISSA WROTE A NOVEL CALLED THE CARE AND FEETING OF RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY GIRLS WHICH I READ LAST SOMMER AND WAS REALLY AFFECTED BY THE NOVELS PATAGONIST IS A BLACK LASSBEAN IN HER FORTIES WITH AN EATING DISORDER A DESCRIPTION THAT EXPLODES ALL KINDS OF STEREOTYPES ABOUT WHO HAS EATING DISORDERS AND WHO GETS TO TELL STORIES ABOUT THEM AN NISSA IS IN HER FIFTIES HER BENGING AND PURGING STARTED IN COLLEGE LIKE ME SHE HID HER EATING DISORDER FROM EVERYONE IN HER LIFE FOR YEARS I I USED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT YOU KNOW NOT DOING CERTAIN BEHAVIOURS AT HOME AN SOMEONE COULD HEAR MY WIFE HERT ME AH IN BATHROOM AT ONE POINT AND THAT WAS WHEN YOU KNOW OMAS YOU DROPPED AN NISSA AGREED TO GET HELP BUT ONLY BECAUSE HER WIFE WANTED HER TOO THEY LIVE OUTSIDE AT LANTA AND IS SA FOUND IN EATING DISORDER CENTER THERE SHE SHUT UP FOR HER FRUI S GROUPD THERE A PESESSION STRAIGHT FROM A THREE HOUR WORK OUT AND A BENGIN BURGE AND AH ONE OF THE THINGS I NOTICED IMMEDIATELY UPON WALKING IN WAS THAT YEUA I WAS THE ONLY BLACK PERSON IN THE ROOM I'M NOT UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT SANARIA IT YOU KNOW THAT'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN THE CASE FOR ME A MOST IF NOT ALL MY LIFE AH MONSEU THAT WAS FINE AND BUT I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY HOW YAH THE WOMEN WERE IN THE IN THE GROUD MOSTLY COLLEGE AGE AND TWENTIES ONE AROUND FORTY LIKE A NESSA WAS THAT THEY WERE THE OLDEST ONES SO FOR THOSE OF US WHOHAVE HAD THIS HISTORY OF EATING DISORTERS THAT'S LASTED YOU KNOW FOR DACHADES INSTEAD OF FOR SEVERAL YEARS AH IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT RIGHT LIKE THE THE NERL PATHWAYS ARE JAS SO MUCH LIKE THE GROOVES ARE SO MUCH DEEPER AT THIS AGE YE YOU KNOW I I THINK BACK TO SOMELIKE ADOLESCE AND DIARY ENTRIES YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD YOU KNON'T BE SCRAWLING AFTER A BENGE AND AND YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A PART OF MY LIFE FOR TWO YEARS I'FE LOST TWO YEARS TO THIS AND MY GOD YOU KNOW THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HA HOW MANY MORE YEARS IS IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YET I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING FOR WOMEN SORT OF IN OUR COHORD PERHAPS NOT TO HAVE SOUGHT TREATMENT AH YE EARLY H AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR OLDER WOMEN TO TALK ABOUT IT AH WHEN I WAS OUT ON TOUR I MET SO MANY WOMEN FORTIS AND FIFTIES AND SIXTIES WHO HAD STRUGGLED FOR JUS YEARS AND YEARS AND WERE FINALLY TRYING TO GET WELL YE I I MEAN THE SAME I BEE WHENEVER I GET A NOTE FROM A WOMAN FORTYE FIFTY SIXTEENS EVEN SEVENTIES WAS ALWAYS SOMEBODY WHOS STRUGGLED FOR YEARS AND I I HAVE THOUGHT THE EXACT SAME THING AS YOU THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT M ARE CONTEMPORARIES WERE WE DIDN'T SEEK TREATMENT EARLY AND AND THEN PART OF ME STARTED WONDERING IS IT YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF JANEX LATCHKY  YU KNOW ER WAS IT JUST A DIFFERENT TIME I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IN THIS HIS OWN RECOVERY BEYOND THAT SHE HAD MORE OF IT UNDER HER BELT THAN I DO TEN YEARS INTO IT SHE DOESN'T FEEL TOTALLY FREE IT WASN'T WHAT SHE EXPECTED AT THE BEGINNING I THOUGHT THAT AH THAT THERE WOULD BE AN END THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD REACH THIS PLACE WHERE I DIDN'T HAVE THESE THOUGHTS ANY MORE I DID NOT HAVE THESE URGES ANY MORE AND AH AND I WAS WOULD BE QUOT ANT QUOT NORMAL I WOULD HAVE A VERY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD I HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD FOR SURE AH BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL EVER BE QUOTE UN QUOTE THA NORMAL AH WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD AND EXERCISE YE TI MEIN THERE I'S DISAPPOINTMENT AN YOU KNOW REALIZING OCAY THIS IS GONE A BE WITH ME BUT THERE'S ALSO A ASSENS A A ACCOMPLISHMENT AND REGILIANT AH THAT I HAVE ID I KNOW WHAT LIFE USED TO BE LIKE FOR ME AND I KNOW WHAT IT IS NOW H SO IT IT'S IT'S EASIER BUT YOU I JUST HAVE TO BE VIGILANT AND CAREFUL SO IF AT THE BEGINNING OF TREATMENT YOUARE IMAGINING THAT THERE WILL BE AN END AND YOU'LL REACH A PLACE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE THE THOUGHTS ANY MORE AH AND IN THIS KIND OF A STAGE WHERE YOU DISAPPOINTED TO REALIZE LIKE OCADE THIS IS GOING TO BE WITH ME YOU KNOW I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THIS AS SOME ONE WHO AM TEYW WONDERS IF IF THIS THIS WONE WE WHERE I WIND UP TWO AND AND AT SO AH I'M WONDERING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE HARD TO ANSWER BUT I'M JUST WONDERING KIND OF LIKE HOW YOU KNEW THAT AND WHEN YOU KNEW THAT I THINK IT WAS SOMEWHAT EVOLUTIONARY AH I ENDED TREATMENT YOU KNOW WICH STILL YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THOUGHTS AND AM I WAS MUCH BETTER IT MANAGING THEM BUT AS TIME WENT ON I DID START TO WONDER OK I SAID IS IS THIS IS THIS JUST HOW I'M GOING TO BE AT THES THOUGHT IT WOULD SORT OF WORK ITSELF OUT AHM AS I WENT ON AH AND SO FAR IT HASN'T AH ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THAT I I THE THOUGHTS AR MUCH FEWER AH YOU KNOW THE COMPULSION AND NOTHING COMPARED TO THE WAY I STARTED OUT IT NISSA SAYS THAT ONE THING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO HER IN THIS PROCESS WAS WATCHING A FRIEND GET SOBER IN SOBRIETY FOR MANY PEOPLE THE IDEA IS THAT YOU'RE NEVER RECOVERED ALWAYS IN RECOVERY IT'S A PROCESS US ALWAYS ON GOING THAT NEVER ENDS AS ANESS ASSAL WITH HER FRIEND I THINK IT WAS THROUGH THAT AND SORT OF WATCHING HER MANAGE AND WATCHING HER UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE THIS IS AN ON GOING THING FOR ME HER PEACE WITH THAT I THINK WAS REALLY HELPFULL FOR ME TI SORT OF GET SOME PECE WITH MYSELF LIK DID NOT FEEL SO TORTURED ABOUT IT DO NOT FEEL LIKE AH WELL WAS ME THIS IS THE CROSS I HAVE TO BEAR YOU CAN LIVE LIVE AND YOU CAN YOU BE HAPPY YOU JUST HAVE YOUR THIINK YOU KNOW I DO'T BEIT MAKE MAYBE THERE MEYBERY THERE IS SOME YOU KNOW POINT RA I'LL JUST BE FINEAND BUT I DON'T SEE THAT BUT I'M ALSO OL KAY WITH THAT TALKING TO INISSA ABOUT BEING OKEY WITH AN ONGOING THING IT HELP ME IMAGINE HOW I MIGHT FEEL IN THE FUTURE WHAT I WANT ITS SIMPLE LIKE IF MY SON WERE TO COME INTO THE KITCHEN AND ASKED ME TO COME TO THE GARDEN WHILE I WAS MAKING FOOD I HAVE A REACTION LIKE OH I'M ABOUT TO EAT SOMETHING BUT I'LL COME OUT WHEN I'M THROUGH DOU WANT TO SIT WITH ME WHILE I EAT ANDTHN WE COULD GO OUT TOGETHER AND WHEN WE WENT OUTSIDE TO THE GARDEN I WOULD JUST BE IN MY BODY I WOULDN'T FEEL MY FLESH AND IF MY NEIGHBOUR CAME OVER I WOULD WAVE AND CHAT AND NOT FEEL FAKE OR TERRIFIED HERE WOULD JUST BE IN EASE AND IF SOMETHING DID RISE OUT SOME SPIKINESS SOME FEAR SOME URGED TO REACH FOR FOOD OR TO REJECT IT I BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT AND IF DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS I SUBMITTED TO IT I BE ABLE TO TOLERATE THE DISAPPOINTMENT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD FEEL LIKE RECOVERY TO ME I DON'T THINK I CAN KNOW UNTIL I GET THERE BUT I THINK IT WOULD FEEL LIKE STURDINESS SAYS BURTON SIYS MEDITOR ON A PROGRAMME  MEMOR ABOUT A READING TDISORDER IS CALLED EMPTY COMING OUT

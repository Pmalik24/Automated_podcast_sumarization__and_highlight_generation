SUGGESTED A CHURCH THAT SHE HA BEEN CASUALLY ATTENDING DOWN THE STREET FIRST CORRENT THE AN BAPTISTCHURCH THE FIRST SUNDAY I WENT I NOTICED THE LINE HALF A BLOCK LONG MOSTLY OF WLIKE PEOPLE AND CARGO SHORTS WAITING PATIENTLY BEHIND A ROT OLDE BLACK MAN WITH CHURCH FLIERS IN HIS HAND COULD SEE I WAS CONFUSED HE WAVED ME TO WARD THE FRONT DOOR AND GREETED ME AS IF HE WERE GOD'S BOUNCER IT'S A BIG PLACE AN OLD MOVIN THEATR BOUT TWO THOUSAND SEATS MARBLE FLOORS USHERS CHANDELIERS I WALKED DOWN THE CROWDED ISLES AND INTERDUPT SITTING NEXT TO AN ELDERLY WOMAN DRESSED IN HER SUNDAY BAST WITH THIS BROAD BRIMMED REGAL HAD SHE MINED ME OF MY GREAT ANT LOUISE WHEN I SLID INTO THE PEW SHE HUGGED ME I THEN REALIZED HOW MUCH I NEEDED THAT HUG UNTIL MY EYES STARED TO CHEER UP SIS S ITS  THE SERVICE BEGAN WITH GUIDED MEDITATION AND ENDED WITH COMMUNION AND THE CHOIERS SINGING FRANKY BEVELYAN MAZES HAPPY FEELS SEVENY'S ARM B WITH THE BLOOD OF CHRIST I THOUGHT SECULAR MUSIC LOSKS OF YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE IA PASTER AND GENES I FOUND MY OWNS THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM ABOVE ME AND THE FAR BACK OF THE BALCONY WERE TOROS THE WHITE PEOPLE IN LINE FROM OUTSIDE HUNDREDS OF THEM SNAPPING SELTIES AND GOCKING HOVERING LIKE GAGGLE OF ANTHOPOLOGIS STUDYING BLACK BAPTISTS IN THE NATURAL HAPITET EVERY EXPRESSION OF WORSHIP EVERY TEER I SHED EVERY HUG I GAVE EVERY ARM I OUTSTRETCHED TO GOD I FELT THIK I WAS ON DISPLAY FOR THEM I FELT EXPOSE THEY WERE BAPTISMS SOME OF THE DEVOUT BEING BAPTIZED A OVERCOME GREAT ODDS WHOT IN PARTICULAR GOT THE HOLY SPIRIT AND SOPPED IN THE POOL SOMETHING UNNAMED AND SACRED HAD LED THEM TO THAT MOMENT AND ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WITH THE WHITE PEOPLE UPSTAIRS TAKING PICTURES OF SOME ONE'S LIFE ALTERING SPIRITUAL JOURNEY SO THEY COULD CHEER THEM OVER BRUNCH IS REALLY MESSING WITH MY WORSHIP WHITE TORIS VIS ITTING BLACK CHURCHES IS A THING ESPECIALLY AT HARLAND SHOWING UP FOR FREE MUSIC IT WAS MY FIRST TIME HEARING ABOUT IT BUT I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED IT BEFORE SURE THERE WERE SOME WHITE CONGREGANTS SPRINKLE THROUGHOUT DOWNSTAIRS BUT THEY ARE MEMBERS FOR LACKTABETER PHRASE THEY ARE VITED TO THE COOK OUT THE CHORST IN THE BALCONY IT JUS WANT A SONG I KEPT GOING TO THE CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY BUT I THOUHT LIKE I WAS UNWILLINGLY PARTISCIPATING AND THER GOSPEL CONCERT I STRUGGLED TO FOCUS SOMEWHAT MATTER TO ME MOST MY OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BIG EYE UPSTAIRS I WAS NAVIGATING ALL THAT MY LEARNED ABOUT THE REVIEWS THOREST CRITIQUE THE CHURCH WENE LINE IT MI VIEWS ON WEBSIDES LIKE YELL BAND TRIP ADVISER SOME WERE FINE SEEM I LOVE THE EXPERIENCE AND THANKED THE CHURCH FOR WELCOMING OUTSIDERS OTHERS WERE NOT SO NICE QOTE THE MUSIC WAS LOUD REPETITIVE AND VACUAS CHURCHIS TO ELEVATE US TO GOD DNOT BRING HIM TO HUMAN LEVELNG TWO STARS FROM FRANCE THIS IS A SCAM THE CHILDREN SINGING OUR CIRCUS ANIMALS ONE STAR FROM ITALY DON'T CHOOSE THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE EXPECTING THE GOSPEL STYLE OF SISTER AT ONE STAR AND THIS ONE TIS MEANT TO BE A COMPLIMENT THAT I BRISTLE FROM SPAIN I WILL DEFINITELY REPEAT THIS EXPERIENCE IF I GO BACK TO NEW YORK DO NOT BE AFRAID TO GO TO HARLAND WIN YOUR OWN THE LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE LIVED THERE FOUR STARS OUR WORSHIP WAS BEING GRATED ON A GENTRIFIED CURVES I GOT ANGRY I DON'T LIKE THE TORIST BUT I DO LOVE THE CHURCH IT HAS THE FAMILIARITY AND THE WARMTH THAT I GREW UP WITH BUT NONE OF THE CONSERVATIVE AND TOLERANT BAGGAGE THE KIND THAT'S HESITANT TO LET WOMEN ON DEACON BOARDDS AND HAD STRICT DRESS COATS MY OLD CHURCH WAS MORE INSOLAR MORE OF AN OLD SCHOOL BLACK BACK TO SPACE BIK IF YOU SAW A WHITE PERSON DURING SERVICE TAT REQUIRED A WHOLE QUIZZICAL DISCUSSION IN THE CAR WRIED HOME WERE THEY LOST THEY SOME ONES SPECIAL FRIEND F C B C HAD NONE OF THAT AND I FOUND IT LIBERATINGS SO KEPT GOING TO THE CHURCH AS GON TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT BUT IT WASN'T EASY    H ONE REACENT SUNDAY AT CHURCH ENGROSSED IN A FIFTEMENTE OREDITION OF THE BLOOD WILL NEVER LOSE ITS POWER I SWAYE TO THE SONG IT MEDITATIVELY MOUT  THE WORDS WITH TE CHIR OVER AND OVER AGAIN I WAS LOSING MYSELF AND FEELING GOD'S PRESENCE BUT OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I NOTICED IT THE GLOWING OF PHONES IN THE DARK THE OLD EUROPEAN MAN WITH THA SELTHY STIC THE BACK PACK LEADIN TORIST SSTEPPING OUT BEFORE THE SERMON THREE OR FOUR AT A TIME   WEWE WE NWO IIIII WO   Y  AN O IWO   O  O  BEHUG THE VISITORS AS THE CHURCH INSTRUCTS US TO DO DURING THE WELCOME AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS OVER FORTY FIVE TOURS UP AND WALKED OUT BEFORE THE SERMON HAD EVEN BEGUN ALL I COULD THINK WAS THE AUDACITY SO RUINED   LISTEN TO THE SERMONS I FELT TORN AND DISTRACTED BY THE TORRIST AT HAVE TO BE THERE AT ALL WHY DO I CARE SO MUCH I ASKED THOG THE CONGRAGANCE OF HAVING TE TOURIST THERE EVER MADE THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE IF THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT ODD THEY EVER GOT SELF CONSCIOUS IF IT WAS ONLY ME ONE THOUGHT THE TOURIST FOR FABULOUS I NOTHER SAID THEY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT WHEN WOMAN SAID MI NOT WANTING THEM THERE WAS BLASPHENES SO YET SEEMS LIKE IT WAS ONLY ME IT WAS CONFUSING YES I DON'T WANT THE TOURIST THERE BUT WHAT KIND OF CHRISTIAN A I TO BEHAVING WHEN PEOPLE DORING A CHURCH CURVISE SO  WENT TO THEHAD OF THE CHURCH MY PASTOR PASTOR MIKE WALREN TO ASK WHY THESE TOURIST HERE WHY WE LIKNG TIS HAPPEN AND HOW MI SUPPOSE TO DEAL WITH IT AND SEE PASSED IT WHY DO YOU WANT THE TORIST IT I DO'T KNOW S ANYTHING BOT WANTING TORIST WE WELCOME EVERYONE SO I DON'T I DON'T NES SO SAY WHI WANT THIS THESE PEOPLE HER I WANT THOSE PEOPLE WHEREVER COMES I SELEBRATE AND WE OPEN SO I KNOW THAT CHURCH IS THAT AN  SAY DID THEY WHEN ALLOW TORIS OR WHEN THEY DO MAKE THE TORIS PAY IT ONCE ON MONEY THE COME IN THEY'LL TAKE THE MONEY RIHT BUT FOR US I THINK EVERY ONE HEREIS A TOURIST AND LIT I SEL YOU I KNOW THE POWER THE WORD AND HOW THE WORD CAN SPREAD AND HOW PEOPLE CAN TAKE WHAT THEY HERE HERE AND IT GOS PLACES YOUR WORDS WELL GO TO PLACES IT SHE WILL NEVER GO AND SO THATS ALWAYS LOOK AT IT IT IS A OPPORTUNITY TO SPREAD THIS WORD AN TO GET THE MESSAGE OLBY THE DOING AND EXPAND AND BROUGDEN OUR REAGE AND SOMETIMES OF PEOPLE WHO EXPAN AND BROUGHT OUR REAGE HAPPENE T BE TOURIST PAS TO MIKE ALSO SAID MY SENSITIVITY ABOUT THE TOURIST THOUGH HE UNDERSTANDS IT ITS GENERATIONALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE OLDER BLACK CONGRAGANTS WHO PERCEIVE THE OTECTS OF HAVING ESSENTIALLY A SECTION FOR WHITE PEOPLE AND A MORE I RODIC WAY THAT I DO THE SEE OT TOURIS WO DOUNT LE WHITE IN ABALTCONY CAULE THEY KNO HISTRN NOP TO KNOW IT US DIFFERENT CAUSE HISTORIPY WAS FLIPPED WHATL THAT WAS THE PRACTISE COUNTRY FOR YEARS AFTER AMERICANS HAS SITTEN BALTCNY COAND NOT WORSHIP WITH WHITE PEOPLE BECAUSE AFTER AMERICANS RELEGATED ABALCONY AD COULD NOT ENGAGE WORSE YOUR EXPERIENCE HE KNOWS THE TOURIST OR NOT WHAT EVERYONE ANTS BUT WHAT PASKE TO MIKE WANTS ME TO KNOW THAT THE TOURIST ARE'T JUST IN THE BALCONY AND THERE AREN'T JUST WHITE E SAYS THE BALCONY IS FOR LARGE GROUPS OF VISITORS AND IT JUST HAPPENE TO BE EUROPEAN HE INSISTS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF TOURISTS IN THE CHURCH AREN'T WHITE THEY'RE BLACK THEY BLENDEN SITTING DOWN THE MAINFLOOR WITH ALL OF US SO THEY PUTS I BACK TO ME IS MY PROBLEM WITH TOURIST OR WITH WHITE TORIST IT'S WHITE TOURIST HE TELLS ME DON'T BE PREJUDISE IT'S WRONG AND WE START LOOKING AT PEOPLE AND TO OUR SPACES OF WORSHIP AND BECAUSE TIS STRANGES TREATING THEM AND BECAUSE THE OBVIOUSLY STRANGES BECAUSE OF THE RACIAL DIMENSION THEN WE UNDEMY OURSELVES AS FOLLOWERS OF THE TEACINGS OF JESUS AND AS PEOPLE CALL OURSELVES CHRISTIANE AND I KNOW THAT BUT I CAN'T STOP FEELING EXPOSE IT LOOKS THE WAY IT LOOKS WHITE PEOPLE STARING DOWN ON US PRAISING GOD THE OBTECTS ARE ALL WRONG IS TI GUESS CAUSE I FEEL I CERTAIN PROTECTIVENESS BECAUSE OF THE SHARED EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE AS BLACK PEOPLE I TO LIKE PROTECTIVENESS O LIKE YOU WE ARE INTOXICATED BY PERCEPTIONS AN IMAGE AND OBTECTS AND OBTECTS COMMUNICATE NO SUBSTANCE SO THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT APPEARS QUESTIONS DO I CERE I QUESTION QUITE ANSWERS NO I CAN'T BE CONSUME WITH PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF OUR SPACE BECAUSE THEY NOT BE TRYING AT COULD TELL WE DO TO TO RESPOND OF PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS I THAT'S NOT WHO WE CALL TO BE I CAN'T SO THE OBTECTS OF IT ME NOTHING TO ME PASTTO MI K KNOWS WHAT HIT LOOKS LIKE MAKING WHITE PEOPLE SIT IN HA SECTIONED OFF ARIA HE KNOWS IS PROVOCKETED HE'S FINE WITH IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE PUNISHMENT BUT THAT DOESN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION HOW DO I BLACK THEM OUT WHEN I WORSHIP MI WORSHIP I ENGAGE GOD I COULD CAR WHOAS A ONE PERSON WHAT TWO THOUSAND I DON'T CARE WHOSE PRESENT IS ABOUT ME IN THAT MOMENT'S SACREDS SPACE I DOING THE PRESEN OTHERS WO AS CELEBRATED GOD BUT THAT'S THE SACRED MOMENT FOR ME AND MY SACRED MOMENT CAN NOT BE INTRUDED PON MY ANY BODY TORS ON NOT ERAS TER MIKES WORDS HELPED A LITTLE I'M ASPIRING

TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TEACHERS ARE ON THE EZUME CALL YOU KNOW WHERE ALL IN OUR OWN ROOMS YOU'RE ON THE BUILDING BUT YOU'R IN YOUR OWN ROOMS YESONES T IN'T LIKE NOTHING HAPPENS AT THIS MEETING THE WHOLE MEETING IS TRIVIAL INFORMATION THEY INTRODUCE NEW FACULTY MEMBERS THEY SHEARE POSITIVE NEWS FROM TEACHERS SUMMERS LIKE NEW BABIES OR ENGAGEMENTS THEY TALK ABOUT OUR ESSAY TEA SCHOORS SAND LAST YEAR ALL THINGS THAT WE HEAR ANNUALLY WHEN THE FUNDLY YOU TALK ABOUT THE RESTART PLAN HE SAYS IS A LOT OF WE CAN DO IT POSITIVITY BUT NO CONCRETE DETAILS BOUT WETHER TOY BE GOING ON VIRTUAL OR WHAT THE PLANWAS CON TO BE SO THEM MEETING ANDS AND WE'RE ALL SORT OF SITTING THERE THINKING LIKE WHAT WHAT WAS IT AND MY COLLEAGUE AND I ARE DETERMINED TO FIGURE THE SOUT SO IT'S FOR NOW WE'RE LIKE WE'RE GONGTO GO DOWN TO THE ADMINISTRATORS OFFICES AND JUST SEE WHAT WE COAND SEE AND WE WE GO TO ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATORS OFFICES AND THERE ARE TWO OTHER ASSISTANT PRINCIPLES IND THERE AT'S PRETTY S PRETTY JAMED AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE SITUATION ROOM AND AN Y WHITE HOUSE ACTION DRAMAOUNO THERE'S PAPERS ALL OVER THE TABLE AND EVERYBODYES ON THE COMPUTER AND EVEN FOR AS FEW PEOPLE ARE IN THE ROOM THERE'S SORT OF TALKING PAST EACH OTHER IN THEIR MULTIPAL CONVERSATIONS GOING ON AND MY FRIEND AND I CON I GOT THAIVE OF LIKE WHERE DOES GEEN A STAND AT THE DOOR YOU KNOW OARE NOT OVEN GON TO COME AND WAIT INTO THE WATER BUT WHAT WE FIND OUT IS THAT IN THE AFTERNOON THE DISTRICT APPARENTLY CAME BACK TO THE SCHOOLS AND WAS LIKE O K NEW PLAN YOU NEED STUDENTS IN THE BUILDING ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL FIVE DAYS A WEEK AT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT CAPACITY THAT'S ALL WE'RE GIVING YOU FIGURE IT OUT AND SO WELL WWY AT TABLE ARE ALL THESES ROSTERS OF STUDENTS AND AND SCHENDULING AND SO THERE'S SOME LEGISTICAL NIGHTMARE THE LEJISTIC TO NIGHT MARRIAGE TO SOUTH CAROLINE A MANDATES THAT EVERY PARENT SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO SEND THE GOOD TO SCHOOL FOR IMPERSON INSTRUCTION IF THEY WANT WE'LL KEEP THEM AT HOME FOR VIRTUAL LEARNING IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT WHICH IS THE KIND OF TRYING TO PWEASE EVERYBODY SOLUTION THAT IN PRACTICE IT IS JUST ENORMOUSLY DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE IT MEANS THAT THERE HVE TO BE SOME STUDENTS IN SCHOOL FIVE DAYS A WEEK BUT OF COURSE IR'S ONLY SO MUCH SPACE IN THE SCHOOL FOR STUDENTS WITH PROPER SERS O DISTANCE SING SO HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHO GETS TO ATTEND AND WHO DOES NOT GET TO ATTEND AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CANNOT GIVE EVERY FAMILY WHAT IT WANTS MEANWHILE IN THE CLASS ROOMS HE SOUTH CAROLINA HEADS TORDS FIRST DAY OF CLASSOS SEPTEMBER EIGHTH DE YOUS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY DID NOT DO LAST SPRING WHEN SCHOOLS WENT ON QUARENTINE THAT 'I WE GET HOW DO YOU TEACH A CLASS IRE'S PARTLY AT HOME PARTLY IN THE ROOM WITH YOU WHICH IS A PARTICULARLY IT'S PARTICULARLY FUNNY TO THING FOR CHUIR IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT TO TEACH VIRTUALLY A MAN HE'S A QUIRE TEACHER TRYING TO SING IN AZUME WITH OTHER PEOPLE IS ITIS JUST A NIGHTMARE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EVENS IF YOU SAY LIKE WHAT'S CLAP AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THEY WILL TAT YOU'LL HERE LIKE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CLASS BECAUSE EVERY BEITS COURSE I TIS A LITTLE DELAY AND THAT TO LAY MAKES IP IMPOSSIBLE TO SING TOGETHER YET NOT TO MENTION THAT USUALLY THE SOFT WEREIS BUILT TO TO IDENTIFY HO IS SPEAKING AND AMPLIFY THEIR VOICE AND SILENCE OTHER PEOPLE SO THE ONLY WT TO SING TOGETHER IS WITH EVERYBODY ON YOU AND YOU KNOWT WHAT CON A REHEARSAL S THAT AND THE ONE FORTH OF THE CLASS HS CAN BE IN THE ROOM WITH THEM THEY CANSING TOGETHER IN THE ROOM BECAUSE SINGING IN A CHORUS CAN BE A SUPERSPREADOR EVENT FOR THE VIRUS REMEMBER THAT ACQUIRE IN YOUR SEATO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDAMIC WHERE FIFTY TWO PEOPLE GOT SIC EVEN WITH MASS ITS NOT SAVE WHICH MEANS SINGING TOGETHER IS THE ONE THING YOU CANNOT DO IN CHORUS MAT'S GLASSES ARE NINETY MINUTES LONG AND WRITE NOWYE FIGURES WHE TEACH THE KIDS ONZUME IN THE KIDSEN CLASSROOM TOGETHER FOR HALF AN HOUR AT THE BEGINNING OF IT LECTURE STYLE GE ABOUT SINGING SIMONS TO DO AT HOME AND THEN AT THA THIRTY MINUTE MARK OR SOMETHING I WOULD PROBABLY DISMISS THOSE ZUME STUDENTS SAY LIKE O YOU GOT YOUR SIMENTS I'LL SEE SON TAKE THE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THE ROOM SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE WHERE WE CAN BE SPACED OUT AND ACTUALLY PRACTICE SINGING WITH THAT WHEATHER PERMITTING YET WHETHER  ET WE JUST WORK AN HAVE TO JUST MA GIVER THE WHOLE SMASS TER BASIC LAY YEU KNOW SO YOU RE ENGINEERING EVERY PART OF YOUR JOB LIKE EVERY SINGLE ISOFIT EXACTLY OTHE TEACHERS IS AID THIS TO ME TOO THE VIRTUAL TEACHINGS MAKING THEM RETHINK AND RE

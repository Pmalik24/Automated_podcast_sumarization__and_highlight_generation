ANYON AFTER TALKING TO CHRIS MATRALLY I CALLED EVAN HOW DID IT GO YOU KNOW WERE WE DONHT WONT THE QUIZS PART ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE MAKING A FRIEND PART JUST GENERAL IMPRESSIONS YEAT GENERAL PRESSION I THINGU WINT WELL I DON'T WE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE FUN THAN OU TANTICIPATING IT TO BE YOU KNOW I CAN DIFENLY SEE MYSELF HANGING OUT WITH HIM AGAIN THIS WAS CONFUSING TO ME BECAUSE THE ENTIRE TIME THAT I TALK TO EVAN HE JUST DIDN'T SAY THAT MUCH ABOUT CHRIS OR HOW HE HIMSELF FELT ABOUT THE DATE IF HE HAD ANY IMPRESSIONS OF CHRIS HE DIDN'T LET ON THE ONLY THING EVAN GOT PASSIONATE ABOUT AND I SHOULD HAVE EXPECT ED THIS WAS WHEN I ASKED HIM TO REVISIT THE IMPROMPTU STAR TRACK CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH THE HOSTS AT THE END OF THE NIGHT I I LOVE RATH OF CAM AND IN THE THE THE FRIENDSHIP

WERE FRIENDS FOR DECADES WHO WERE WILLING TO DIE FOR EACH OTHER BY THESE STANDARDS CHRIS AND EVANS MANDATE WAS NOT AROUSING SUCCESS BUT I'M MORE OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY BUFF THAN A STAR TRACK FAN AND ROM COMS FOR THE MOST PART OUR ONLY ABOUT THE BEGINNINGS OF RELATIONSHIPS BY THOSE STANDARDS YOU JUST HAVE TO ESTABLISH THAT FIRST CONNECTION ALL YOU REALLY NEED ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO BOTH KIND OF ONE TO MEET SOME ONE AND A POWERFUL EXTERNAL FORCE TO BRING THEM TOGETHER LIKE A BEST FRIENDS IMPENDING WEDDING OR FORCED ROAD TRIP TOGETHER ORSAY ALRADIO PRODUCER JUST TROD TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY

LIKE A HUNDRED DLLARS A DAY AND WE MADE LOVE S ONCE A DAY ON THE AVERAGE THAT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS A SHOT AND EACH TIME IT LASTED MAY BE TWO OR THREE HOURS SO THAT WOULD BE ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY THREE TO FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR WHICH IS EXPENSIVE THOUGH OF COURSE THAT WASN'T ALL THAT WENT ON BECAUSE WE WERE TOGETHER ALMOST ALL DAY LONG SO MAN SHE WOULD KEEP LOOKING AT ME AND EVERY TIME SHE LOOKED AT ME THAT WAS WORTH SOMETHING AND SHE SMILED AT ME AND DIDN'T STOP TALKING AND SINGING SOMETHING I SAID SHE WOULD SAIL INTO IT TO SNATCH FOR ME SHE WOULD BE GONE FOR ME LITTLE WAYS BUT SMILING TOO AND TELL ME JOKES I LOVED IT BUT DIDN'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT JUST SMILED BACK AT HER AND FELT SLOW NEXT TO HER JUST NOT QUICK ENOUGH SO SHE TALKED AND TOUCHED ME ON THE SHOULDER IN THE ARM SHE KEPT TOUCHING AND STAYED CLOSE TO ME YOU'RE WITH EACH OTHER ALL DAY LONGIN TOT KEEPS HAPPENING THE TOUCHES AND SMILES AND IT ADDS UP IT BUILDS UP AND YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'LL BE THAT NIGHT YOU'RE TALKING AN EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT NOW OU DON'T THINK AW YOU JUST FEEL IT IS KIND OF A DESTINATION WHAT'S COMING UP AFTER YOU LEAVE WHEREVER YOU ARE ALL EVENING AND YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE PLANNING IT ALL NOT YOUR HEAD REALLY SOMEWHERE INSIDE YOUR BODY ORE ALL THROUGH YOUR BODY IT'S ALL MOUNTING UP AND COMING TOGETHER SO THAT WHEN YOU GET AN BED YOU CAN'T HELP IT IT'S A REAL PERFORMANCE MAN IT ALL POURS OUT BUT SLOWLY YOU GO EASY UNTIL YOU CAN'T ANY MORE OR YOU HOLD BACK THE WHOLE TIME YOU HOLD BACK AND TOUCH THE EDGES OF EVERYTHING YOU EDGE AROUND AND TILL YOU HAFE TO PLUNGE IN AT FINISH IT OFF AND WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED YOU'R TOO WEAK TO STAND BUT AFTER WHYE YOU HAVE T GO THE BATH ROOM AND YOU STAND YOUR LEGS AR TREMBLING YOU HOLD ON TO THE DOOR FRAMES AS A LITTLE LIGHT COMING IN THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE YOUR WAY IN AND OUT BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THE BED SO IT'S REALLY NOT A HUNDRED OURS AS SHOP BECAUSE IT GOES ON ALL DAY FROM THE START WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND FEEL HER BODY NEXT TO YOU YOU DON'T MISS A THING AND NOT A THING OF WHAT'S GOING ON NEXT O YOU HER LEG HER ARM HER SHOULDER HER FACE THAT GOOD SKIN I'VE FELT OTHER GOOD SKIN BUT THIS SKIN IS JUST THE EDGE IS SOMETHING ELSE AND YOU GET A START GOING ONLY NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU CRAWL OLD OVER EACH OTHER WON'T BE ENOUGH AND WHEN YOUR HUNGER DIES DOWN A LITTLE BIT THEN YOU START THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HER AND THEN THAT START YOU OFF AGAIN AND HER FACE AND YOU LOOK OVER TER R FANCE AND YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW YET GOT THERE AND HOW LUCKY AND IT'S ALL STILL A SURPRISE AND IT IT NEVER STOPS A MEAN EM EVEN AFTER IT'S OVER IT NEVER STOPS BEING A SURPRISE IT'S MORE LIKE YOU HAVE A GOOD SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY THITS GOING ON EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT WITHER IT'S STILL GOING ON AT ME IT'S GOOD TO BE AWAY FROM HER BECAUSE IT CAN TO BE SO GOOD TO GET BACK TO HER NOW IT'S STILL THERE IN YOU ND YOU CAN'T GO OFF AND LOOK AT SOME OLD STREET OR SOME OLD PAINTING WITHOUT FEELING IT YOUR BODY AND A FEW THINGS THAT HAPPEN THET DAY BEFORE THAT DON'T MEAN MUCH BY THEMSELVES OR WOULDN'T MEAN MUCH IF YOU WEREN'T HAVING THIS THING TOGETHER BUT YOU CAN'T FORGET AND IT'S ALL INSIDE IF YOU ALL THE TIME SO IT'S MORE LIKE SAY SIXTEEN INTO A HUNDRED WOULD BE SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR WHICH ISN'T TOO MUCH BUT IT ISN'T OVER WHEN IT ENDS AND AND IT GOES ON AFTER IT'S ALL OVER SHE STILL INSIDE YOU LIKE A SWEET LOOCUR YOURE FILLED WITH HER EVERYTHING ABOUT ERS KIND OF BLED INTO YOU HER VOICE OR SMELL THE WAY HER BODY MOVES IT'S ALL INSIDE OF YOU AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AFTER THEN YOU BEGIN TO LOSE IT AND I'M BEGINNING TO LOSE IT YOU'RE AFRAID HOW WEAK YOU ARE THAT YOU CAN'T GET HER ALL BACK INTO YOU AGAIN AND NOW THE WHOLE THING IS GOING TO BE OUT OF YOUR BODY AND IT'S MORE IN YOUR MIND THAN IN YOUR BODY AND THE PICTURES COME T YOU ONE BY ONE AND YOU LOOK AT THEM SOME OF THEM LAST LONGER THAN OTHERS THE PICTURES COME TO YOU AND YOU HAVE TO HOPE THEY WON'T LOSE THEIR LIFE TOO FAST AND DRY UP THOUGH YOU KNOW THEY WILL AND THAT YOUL ALSO FORGET SOME OF WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE ALREADY YOU'RE TURNING UP LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU NEARLY FORGOT WE WERE IN BED AND SHE ASKED ME DO I SEEM FAT TO YOU AND I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO WORRY ABOUT HERSELF AT ALL IN THAT WAY AND I GUESS I WAS READING INTO IT THAT SHE DID WORRY ABOUT HERSELF SO I ANSWERED WHAT I WAS THINKING AND SAID STUPIDLY THAT SHE HAD A VERY BEAUTIFUL BODY THAT HER BODY WAS PERFECT AND I REALLY MEANT IT AS AN ANSWER BUT SHE SAID KIND OF SHARPLY THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED AND SO I HAD TO TRY TO ANSWER HER AGAIN EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD ASKED AND ONCE SHE LAY OVER AGAINST ME LATE AT NIGHT AND SHE STARTED TALKING HER BREATH IN MY EAR AND SHE JUST WENT ON AND ON AND TALKED FASTER AND FASTER SHE COULDN'T STOP AND I LOVED IT AND JUST FELT THAT ALL THAT LIFE AN HER WAS RUNNING IN TO ME TOO I HAD SO LITTLE LIFE IN ME HER LIFE FOR FIRE WAS COMING INTO ME IN THAT HOT BREATH IN MY EAR N I JUST WANTER TO GO ON TALKING FOR EVER RIGHT THERE NEXT TO ME AND I WOULD GO ON LIVING LIKE THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GO ON LIVING BUT WITHOUT HER I DON'T KNOW THEN YOU FORGET SOME OF IT ALL THEY BE MOST OF IT ALL ALMOST ALL OF IT IN THE END AND YOU WORK HART AT REMEMBERING EVERYTHINGS NELL SO YOU WON'T NEVER FORGET BUT YOU CAN KILL IT TOO EVEN BY THINKING ABOUT IT TOO MUCH THUGH YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINKING ABOUT IT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEN WHEN THE PICTURES DART TO GO YU START ASKING SOME QUESTIONS JUST LITTLE QUESTIONS THAT SITTIN YOUR MIND WITHOUT ANY ANSWERS LIKE WHY DID SHE LEAVE THE LIGHT ON WHEN YOU CAME TO BED ONE NIGHT BUT IT WAS OFF THE NEXT BUT SHE HAD IT ON THE NIGHT AFTER THAT AND SHE HAD IT OFF THE LAST NIGHT WHI AND AND OTHER QUESTION LITTLE QUESTIONS THAT NAGGET YOU LIKE THAT AND FINALLY THE PICTURES GO AND THESE DRY LITTLE QUESTIONS JUST SIT THERE WITHOUT ANY ANSWERS AND YOU LEFT WITH THIS LARGE HEAVY PAIN IN YOU THAT YOU TRIED TO NUMB BY READING OR YOU TRY TO EASE IT BY GETTING OUT INTO PUBLIC PLACES WHERE THEY'LL BE PEOPLE AROUND YOU BUT NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE PUSHING THAT PAIN AWAY JUST WHEN YO THINK YOU'REGING TO BE ALL RIGHT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THAT YOU'RE SAFE YOUR KIND OF HOLDING IT OFF WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH AND YOU'R STAYING AND SOME BARE LITTLE NUMB SPOT OF GROUND THEN SUDDENLY WILL ALL COME BACK YOU'LL HEAR A NOISE MAYBE'S A CAT CRYING OR A BABE SOMETHING ELSE LIKE HER CRY YOU HEAR IT AND MAKE THAT CONNECTION IN A PART OF YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND THAT PAIN COMES BACK SO HARD THAT YOUERE AFRAID AFRAID O HOW YOU'R GIN A FALL BACK INTO IT AGAIN AND YOU WONDER KNOW YOURE TERRIFIED IT HOW YOU'RE EVER GET A CLIMB OUT OF IT SO IT'S NOT EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY WHILE IT'S HAPPENN IT'S REALLY FOR HOURS AN HOURS EVERY DAY AFTER THAT FOR WEEKS THOUGH LESS AND LESS SO THAT YOU COULD WORK OUT O RATIO IF YHOU WANT MAYBE AFTER SIX WEEKS HAN ONLY THINKING ABOUT IT AN HOUR OR SO WHEN THE DAY ALL TO GATHER A FEW MINUTES HERE AND THERE SPREAD OVER OR A FEW MINUTES HERE AND THERE AND A HALF AN HOUR BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP WERE SOMETIMES IT ALL COMES BACK AND YOU STAY AWAKE HALF THE NIGHT SO WHEN YOU HAD UP ALL THAT IU'VE ONLY SPENT MAYBE THREE HOURS AN HOUR ON IT IF YOU HAVE TO FIGURE IN THE BAD TIMES TOO I DON'T KNOW THERE WEREN'T ANY BAD TIMES IT HER THOUGH MAYBE THERE WAS ONE BAD TIME WHEN I TOLD HER I LOVED HER I COULDN'T HELP IT AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAD HAPPENED WITH HER AND NOW I WAS HALF FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER OR MAYBE COMPLETELY IF SHE'D LET ME BUT SHE COULDN'T OR I COULDN'T COMPLETELY BECAUSE IT WAS ALL GON TO BE SO SHORET AND OTHER THINGS TOO AND SO I TOLD HER AND I DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY WAY TO TELL HER FIRST THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO FEEL THAT THIS WAS A BURDEN YOUW THE FACT THAT I LOVED HER OR THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO FEEL THE SAME ABOUT ME OR SAY THE SAME BACK THAT IT WAS JUST THAT I HAD TO TELL HER THAT'S ALL BECAUSE IT WAS BURSTING INSIDE ME AND SAYING IT WOULD EVEN BEGIN TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT I WAS FEELING REALLY I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING OF WHAT I WAS FEELING BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH WORDS COULDN'T HANDLE IT AND MAKING LOVE ONLY MADE IT WORSE BECAUSE THEN I WANTED WORDS BADLY BUT THERE WERE NO GOOD NO GOOD AT ALL BUT I TOLD HER ANYWAY I WAS LYING ON TOP OF HER AND HER HANDS WERE UP BY HER HEAD IN MY HANDS WERE ON HERS AND OR FINGERS WERE LOCKED AN THERE WAS A LITTLE LIGHT ON HER FACE FROM THE WINDOW BUT I COULDN'T SEE HER AND I WAS AFRAID TO SAY IT BUT I HAD TO SAY IT BECAUSE I WANTED HER TO KNOW IT WAS THE LAST NIGHT I HAD TO TELL HER THEN OR I'D NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE AND I JUST SAID BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP I HAVE TO TELL YOU BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP THAT I LOVE YOU AND IMMEDIATELY RIGHT AWAY AFTER SHE SAID I LOVE YOU TO AND IT SOUNDED TO ME AS IF SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT A LITTLE FLAT BUT THEN IT USUALLY SOUNDS FLAT WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS I LOVE YOU TOO BECAUSE THERE JUST SAYING IT BACK EVEN IF THEY DO MEAN IT AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT I'LL NEVER KNOW IF SHE MEANT IT OR MAYBE SOMEDAY SHE'LL TELLE ME WHETHER SHE MEANTED OR NOT BUT THERE'SN'T THERE'S NO WAY TO KNO NOW AND I'M SORRY I DID THAT IT WAS A TRAP I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT HER IN I I CAN SEE IT WAS A TRAP BECAUSE IF SHE HADN'T SAID ANYTHING AT ALL THAT WOULD HAVE HURT ME TOO YOU KNOW AS THOUGH SHE WERE TAKING SOMETHING FROM ME AND JUST ACCEPTING IT NOT GIVING ANYTHING BACK SO SHE RALLY HAD TO I MEAN EVEN IF JUST TO BE KIND SHE HAD TO SAY IT AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW NOW IF SHE MEANT T ANOTHER BAD TIME OR IT WASN'T EXACTLY BAD BUT TIT WASN'T EASY EITHER WAS WHEN I HAD TO LEAVE THE TIME WAS COMEING AND I WAS BEGINNING TO TREMBLE AND FEEL EMPTY NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE OF ME NOTHING INSIDE T NOTHING TO HOLD ME UP ON MY LEGS AND THEN IT CAME EVERYTHING WAS READY AN I HAD TO GO SO WAS JUST A KISS A QUICK ONE AS THOUGH WE WERE AFRAID OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN HAFTER A KISS AND SHE WAS ALMOST WILD THEN A SHE REACHED UP TO A HOOK BY THE DOOR D TOOK AN OLD SHIRT A GREEN AND BLUE SHIRT FROM THE HOOK AND PUT IT IN MY ARMS FOR ME TO TAKE AWAY THE SOFT CLOTH WAS FULL OF HER SMELL AND THEN WE STOOD THE CLOSE TOGETHER LOOKING AT THIS PIECE OF PAPER SHE HAD IN HER HAND AND I DIDN'T LOSE ANY IT I WAS HOLDING IT TIGHT THAT LAST MINUTE OR TWO BECAUSE THIS WAS IT WE'D COME TO THE END OF IT THINGS ALWAYS CHAING SO THIS WAS REALLY IT OVER MAYBE IT WORKS OUT ALL RIGHT MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T LOST FOR DOING IT I DON'T KNOW NOW REALLY MEAN SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK OF IT YOU FEEL LIKE A PRINCE REALLY YOU FEEL JUST LIKE A KING AND OTHER TIMES YOU'RE AFRAID YOU'RE AFRAID NOT NOT ALL THE TIME BUT NOW AND THEN OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO TO YOT IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT NOW WALKING AWAY I LOOK BACK ONCE AND THE DOOR WAS STILL OPEN I COULD SEE HER STANDING FAR BACK IN THE DARK IN THE ROOM I CAND ONLY REALLY SEE HER WHITE FACE STILL LOOKING OUT AT ME IN HER WHITE ARMS I GUESS YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU LOOK AT THAT PAIN AS IF IT WERE THERE IN FRONT OF YOU THREE FEET AWAY LYING IN A BOX AND OPEN BOX IN A WINDOW SOMEWHERE IT'S HARD AND COLD LIKE A BAR OF METAL YOU JUST LOOK AT IT THERE AND SAY ALL RIGHT I'LL TAKE IT ALL BY IT HAT'S WHAT IT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT BEFORE YOUVEN GO INTO THIS THING YOU KNOW THE PAIN IS PART OF THE WHOLE THING AND IT ISN'T THAT WE CAN SAY AFTERWARDS THE PLEASURE WAS GREATER THAN THE PAIN AND THAT'S WHY YOU'D DO IT AGAIN THAT IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH T YOU CAN'T MEASURE IT BECAUSE THE PAIN COMES AFTER AND IT LAST LONGER SO THE QUESTION REALLY IS WHY DOESN'T THE PAIN MAKE YOU SAY I WON'T DO IT AGAIT WHEN THE PAIN IS SO BAD THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT BUT YOU DON'T SO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT IT HOW YOU CAN GO IN WITH SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE LIKE A THOUSAND AND HOW YOU CAN COME OUT WITH AN OLD SHIRT MABABOY READING WHIDIA DAVIS H'S STORY BREAK IT DOWN IT WAS FERS PUBLISHED IN HER BOOK OF THE SAME

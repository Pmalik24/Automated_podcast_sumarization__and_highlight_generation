TWENTY PER CENT WAS ROUGHLY THE SAME FOR MOST PEOPLE OF COLORERS WELL BUT FOR PARKESTANES IN BARNGLADATIONS AND ASTONISHING FIFTY PER CENT HO NO QUALIFICATIONS WHATSOEVER FIFTY PER CENT HALF OF US WERE BASICALLY FIDING SCHOOL THAT HIT THE HERE HARD THAT THE EXTENT OF EDUCATION FAILURE WAS A SO BAD THAT WE WERE AT RISCOFF CREATING AND UNDER CLASS OF MUSLIMS WHO WERE BASING THE UNEDUCATED PRONE

UNIVERSITY AND TO HAVE A GOOD JOB AND SO ON BUT THEY WAS ALSO A SENSE OF HUMILIATION REALLY BECAUSE I WAS FROM THIS COMMUNITY THE HERE'S FAMILY BOING TO ENGLAND IN THE SEVENTIES WHENE LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM KISHMAY WULD MOVIN HERE LARGELY BECAUSE THE BRACH DESIGNED HIS HUGE DAM THE FLOODED SWATZ OF LAND AND DISPLACE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A ONE SOLUTION THE BRITZ GOT BEHIND WAS TO INVITE DISPLACE PARCTINIS OVER TO ENGLAND SO THE COULD IMPROVE THE BRASH ECONOMY BY WORKING EN BRACH FACTORIES AND MILLS WHICH IS WHAT THE HERES THAT DID THERE ARRIVED IN ENGLAND AS A NINE YEAR OLD WOULDN'T

ENGLISH ONAAS CAME HERE I ACUNY SPEAK FORD OUS IS LIKEMUTE IT IN FORBOR THAT'S WHAT I KNEW FOOTBALL NASIT SO THAT SO YE ARRIVED HERE AND THE FIRST SCHOOL WHEN I CAME HERE WEE WE RI  IS GROWING UP ANGRY AND ANDIANATED FROM WHITE SOCIETY NOW THEY HERE WATCHED AS THE DOCUMENTARY CAPTURED THE NEXT GENERATION BAKINY KIDS WHO A BORNING BRAIND BEING EDUCATE IN STATE SCHOOLS STILL STRUGGLING TO READ NOT ABLE TO RECOR BASIC ENGLISH WORDS THE CAMERA COUT TO PARK IN BAMINGHAM IT LOOKED AT THE HERE LIKE WOORD AND PARK WHICH RIHT ACROSS FROME WHAY HE WENT TO SCHOOL IN AN A MARK I RECOGNIZED THE PARK BECAUSE USED TO GO AND PLAY THERE AND THEN I SAW SOME CHILDREN AS AT ALL THAT'S OUR NEIGHBORS CHILDREN I RECOGNIZED THE KIDS YER EVEN THOSE FROM A DISTANCE BUT I RECOGNIZED WHO THE IDS ARE WE FONDAN IN CANTER WITH TWOATION LADS IN A PARK IN A MISTLIN QUARTER OF BURNING THESE ASIEN LADS WE USE AGENT TO MEAN SOUTATION BY THE WAY THER SCIPPIN SCHOOL AND THE HERE NEW WHICH SCHOOL THEY WERE SKIPPING IS ONE HE'D GONE TO AS A KID RIT NEXT AT A PARK PARKFEW SCHOOL ANOTHER MAJORITY WAS SOME SCHOOL WITH MISERABLE ACADEMIC RESULTS IT'S A SECONDARY SCHOOL AGE IS ELEVEN TO SIXTEEN IS A SCHOOL WET THE HERE HAD DONE WELL ENOUGH TO MAKE IT TO COLLEGE AND THE UNIVERSITY BEFORE GETTING A GOOD JOB IN TENY COMMUNICATIONS  DOCUMENT RO MADE HIM REALIZE HOW RARE HIS SUCCESS WAS AND HOW LITTLE HE DONE WITH IT SO THE HERE DECIDED DO SOMETHING HE STRARTED A TUDORING PROGRAMM FOR KIDS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BOR WHER HE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN WAS VOLUNTEERING AT HIS OLD SCHOOL PARKFEW AND WHAT'S KNOWN AS THEIR GOVERNING BODY IN ENGLAND A GOVERNING BODY OVERSEES HOUSE SCHOOLAS RUN LIKE A CORPORAT BOARD DOES A COMPANY ITS SORTER LIKE A SCHOOLBOARD IN E YOU ASK ACCEPTED SPECIFIC TO ONE SCHOOL THEY CAN HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE SO ANY WAY HERE SAYS ONE AFTERNOON A COUPLE OF PARTRY ARENTS HE DIDN'T KNOW NOCKED ON IS DORE WE HEARY INTERESTIN BECOMING GOVERNOR THEY SAID IT WAS LIKE LHY READ OF MIND THOUGH ACTUALLY TO HEAR A BEEN TALKING ABOUT WANTING TO BE A GOVERNOR OF A RECENT WEDDING AND S PARENTS COUT WIND IT W RESENTMENT AND FRUSTRATION AD BEEN FASTERING FOR YEARS AMONG PARENTS AN OU RARK WHO BEEN TRYING AND TRYING TO GET THE AUTHORITIES TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE DISMAL SCHOOLS THES PARENTS AT THE HEAR'S DOOR HAD JOIND THE PARK FOR GOVERNING BODY IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A CHANGE BUT THEY DIDN'T SPEAK FLUENT ENGLISH AND HADN'T GONE UNIVERSITY TO HER WAS A PROFESSIONAL WITH THE DEGREE WHO STILL LIVED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WE LOVED TO PROPOSOU THEY TOLD HIM AND WITH THAT TO HEAR FOUND HIMSELF AT THE NEXT GOVERNING BODY MEETING OF PARKFEW SCHOOL BEING VOTED IN NOT ONLY AS A MEMBER BUT AS THE CHAIR SO THAT'S WHEN I BECAME A GOVERNOR ON THE SEVENTH OF JANUARY NINETEEN NINETEEN SEVEN HE REMEMBER THE DATE YE AV WHAT I WAS A WAS TO REMAIN THERE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS WHEN TO HER STARTED PARKFEW WAS ONE OF THE WORST SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY ONLY FOUR PERCENT OF STUDENTS WERE PASSING FOUR PER CENT THE NATIONAL SCHOOL INSPECTION AGENCY HAD RECENTLY PLACED THE SCHOOL INTO SPECIAL MEASURES THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RANKING AND EMERGENCY STADAS BASICALLY MEATING PARKFY WAS IN DANGER OF BEING SHUT DOWN THERE WERE BRAWLS BREAKING OUT IN THE SCHOOL YARD ON A TOWARE THE BUILDING T HEAR SAW VANDALIZED BATH ROOMS WITH STALLS MISSING LOCKS AND TOILETS MISSING SEATS BUT WERE TO HEAR REALLY TRAINED IS FOCUS WAS ON THE COMPLACENT TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS WE INITIALLY JUST STARTLED BY SAYING THAT O IS Y CHILDREN SHOULD BE ACHIEVING FIRE THOUGH THE ACHIEVEMENT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOL WAS TO BLAME FOR FOR THE FALURE THIS STATEMENT SO OBVIOUS TO TO HEAR THAT THE KIDS AND ALAM RACH WERE HIS CAPABLES KIDS ANYWHERE WAS MET WITH MASSIVE RESISTANTS E WAS VERY DIFFICULTETTING THE SCHOOL TO ACCEPT THE THEY WERE THE PROBLEM TPEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE THAT THAT THEY BEEN BLAMING THE COMMUNITY FUL AN MAY BE TRU DECATES THEY HAD SUCH A LOW EXPECTATION OF CHILDREN ONE THING TO HEAR NOTICED URLYAN WAS THAT THE STAFF OF THIS SCHOOL WITH NEARLY NINETY PER CENT PACKASTANY STUDENTS HAD ONLY ONE FULL TIME PACKASTANY MUSLEN TEACHER SO TO HERE BEGAN SEARCHING FOR MORE MOSLEM STAFF AND GOVERNORS HE GAVE PRESENTACIONS HELD WORK SHOPS HE BECAME A FIXTURE AT EVENTS SURROUNDY SPIRMING HEM STANDING BEHIND HIS LITTLE TABLE OR BOOTH E VANGELIZING FOR PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IN THEIR LOCAL SCHOOLS I LOFTY A HA HA I LOVED I I THE CHILDREN THE IS E I FELT AS I COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE THIS IS MAS WHO SAYING THE FIRST MOSLEM TEACHER TO HEAR HIRED HE TAUGHT MAST I COULD USE MY LANGUD AGE MY BACKGROUND WANDESTANDING AWERE THEY COME FROM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE I KNEW THEIR FAMILIES MASCAN POINT TO HA SPECIFIC MOMENT BY THE WAY WHEN HE DECIDED TO GO IN TO TEACHING THERE'S A PANERONE PROGRAM  I CALLED AN UNDE CLASSING POT OF THA POWERFUL SEGMENT MAS WO SAYING SAYS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HE ENCOUNTED SEROS PREJUDICES AMONG THE MOST Y WHITE STAFF I A GRUP THE CHILDRENLONE TO ME AND THES SED THAT LISIES WONE TEACHEN IN SCHOOL HE ALWAYS CALLS US PACKIES HE SEES COLLINGIS PACKEESIS TO G IN THE JOKEE WAY BUT WE FIND THE OFFENSIVE THEN I WOULD TELL ANY ONE ELSE WITH THE TELLING ME THAT LOOK THES TESE SWATING ATTUS THAT'S AS LET IN ANY CONTEXT BUT ESPECIALLY SHOCKING FOR A TEACHER TO SAY TO PACKSANY STUDENTS MOSDOL DAM I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO HAPY PARENTS RIT THE SCHOOL HE TOLKED THIM TO THE PRECEGER FOR DOING THEM IN CASE THE PPARENTS DIDIT KNOW HE SAYS EVENTUALLY THE SCHOOL LOOKED IN TO THE TEACHERS BEHAVIOR AND WHILE YOU INVESTIGATING A HE DESIGNE AND HE GAV THES FINAL LEAVING SPEECH N THE STAFF ROOM ANGLS HE SHOULD BE ACAL CHO DOMINA IN THI SCHOOL NOT THE KITS ANDHE FINIH OFF WITH THE WORDS THE WEST IS THE BEST AND OLD TEACHIS CLAFT OLD TEACHIS CLEFT THE RACISM WAS PERVASIVE ROSUIN FERAS A FORMER GOVERNOR AND MATH TEACHER SAY IT WONE OF HIS FIRST GOVERNING BODY MEETINGS HE WAS SHOWN A LIST OF PLACES THE STUDENTS HAD BEEN GIVEN WORK PLACEMENTS THROUGH A PROGRAM AT THE SCHOOL AND IT WAS ALL RESTAURANTS SUPERMARKETS CLOTHING STHOORES AND IT WAS NO SO E GRE DOCTO SETRE ALOPHAMO ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND I SID INA HOW IS IT THAT THAT DID THE CHILDREN DESINED THESE AND RAS ON SAYS THE VICE CHAIR TOLD HIM WELL THE APPARENTS WANT THEM TO GOIN BECOM DOCTOS AN ENGINEERS AN EC CENTRA U REANITIES THESE KIDS WILL BECOME TEXIDRA IS SHOP KEEPERS SO WE'VE GON TO PREPARE THEM NOW AND FOR A GOOD WHILE I WAS STRUGGLING TO PROCESS WHAT HE WAS SAYING THIS IS ME A BROWN PERSON AN AMOSLIN AND HE SAYING TO ME THAT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE THESE KIND OF JOBS THIS IS THIS COMMUNITIES ROLIN SOCIETY AIS THAT'S RAY WE JUST FILE THE KIDS WE JUST FILE THE KIDS AND DID E FEL ABOUT ABOUT IT DIDNT TE WE DIDN' W DI LI FEEL GOSY JOHN BRACHLEY WAS ONE OF THE NON MUSLIN TEACHERS AT PARKVIEW HE WAS A MATEACHER WHO'D BEENTER SINCE THE ADIES HE WAS FRANK WITH US ABOUT THE BIGOTRY THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES HELLD TOWARDS THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AN WE WE WE WE SO THAT WE WERE A SUPERIOR CULTE IND WE LOOK DOWN WE LOOK DOWN ANL THESE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT EDUCATION YOUR TUCKING OT YOURSELF HERE SOON ABOUT MYSELF ARMOST OUT TOLKING ABOUT OUN A MANY OF THE PEOPLE AR WALWAYS THE TEACHERS ATTITUDES ARE DOCUMENTED BY THE WAY A FORMER HEAD TEACHER OF PARKVIEW A HEAD TEACHER IS WHAT WE AMERICANS CALL A PRINCIPAL DID A MASTERS THESIS WHILE HE WAS AT THE SCHOOL FOR WHICH HE COLLECTED OPINIONS FROM THE STAFF INCLUDING FROM JOHN AS TO WY MUSLEM CHILDREN WERE DRASTICALLY UNDER PERFORMING COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS IN THE THESIS TEACHERS SAY THE KIDS PARENTS ARE IGNORANT WRONGLY CLAIM THE STUDENTS TOD SPEAK ENGLISH THE TEACHERS TRY FOR A WHILE ON TEACHER SAID BUT END OF FEELING LIKE WHO GIVES A DAM THAT'S A QUOTE IT MAKES JOHN CRINGE TO THINK BACK ON IT THE SAWY WHEN MOVE WILES  FROM THE SITUATION LIKE THAT THE E TIKOM YOU CAN REALIZE O L FOR THE IS I DON'T NONLY THINK ABOUT ABABOUT THE SO THINK IS 'M IT'S TO EMBARRASSIN ONCE WE CREATED THE SHIFT IN THE BELIEF OF THE TEACHERS THEN TI JOB BECAME MUCH EASIER THER SAYS BY THEIRTY TWO THOUSANDS PARKVIEW WAS CHANGING THE SCHOOL BEGAN TAKING BASIC BUT TRANSFORMATIVE STEPS SETTING INDIVIDUALISE TO CEVE MEN TOKITS FOR EACH STUDENT THE FOLLOWED THEM FROM GET YEAR A PREPARENTS TUDENTS FOT QUALIFYING SAMS WHICH AMAZINGLY HADN'T HAPPEN FOR

ASPIRATIONS TESCOSTARD TO RISE STUDENS EHADING TO COLTAGE PARFE'S REPUTATION WAS TINING AROUND BUT THER ORTHER CHANGES THE HERENTYTUES AR PARKVIEW HICH LATER OFFICIALS WOULD PE US SUSPECT CHANGE THEN INVESTIGATE US WOT POINT TO THE TRADE MARKS VOPERATION TROCAN HORSE IT'S COMING UP INDEED IT IS WHEN HAMS AND BRYHAM RETURN THAT'S IN A MINUTE THE CICAGO BO BAGRADIO WHEN OUR PROGRAMM CONTINUOUS THIS MERICAN MI FROM YR GLASS TO DAY ON OUR PROGRAMM WE ARE PLAYING PART ONE OF THE NEWES PAD CASS FROM OUR SISTER COMPANYS SEREAL PRODUCTIONS SHALL AS CALED THE TROJAN HORSE AFFAIR AND WE PICK UP WITH BRANNOMSA WHERE THEY LEFT OFF YOU DON'T GET LABEL THE LEADER OF AN EXTREMIST CONSPIRACY SIMPLY BY RAISING TESCORESTHAT YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD SECONDARY SCHOOL THE MAIN ACCUSATION AGAINST TO HER ALAM THE OVERARCHING ASSERTION OF THE TROSAN HORSE LETTER WHICH THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED AND WHICH IS DEFINED TO HEAR HIS REPUTATIONS SINCE THEN IS THAT HE WAS ISLEMIZING SCHOOLS THIS IS NOT A WORD A'M PARTICULARLY FOND OF ISLAMIZE BECAUSE IS THE MISE AN RELATION OF WHAT SOME ASSUMED NON ASLOMIC BASE LINE HAS THIS STORY BEEN INSOMIZED BY HAMSAS INVALVEMENT YES IT'S A WORD THAT ISN'T INHERENTLY NEGATIVE BUT GETS USED THAT WAY ANY WAY THAT'S WHAT THE LETTER SAID TO HERE WAS DOING IS LO MIZING SCHOOLS AND FUNNALLY ENOUGH IT'S ALSO WHAT TE HER SAYS HE WAS DOING WE WERE VALUING THE CULTURAL AND THE FAITH BACKGROUND OF THE CHILDREN AND WE WERE LYING THAT TO BE EXPRESSL IF YOU LIKE WE CATED FOR CHILDREN  SO THEY COULD PERFORM THERE IN A DAYTIME PRAYERS IF THEY WANTED TO A WE MADE TA PRAYER FACILITY AVAILABLE FOR THEM IN A ROOM RELIGIOUS COMMODATIONS LIKE THIS ARE LEGAL AND BRITISH SCHOOLS BY THE WAY WHETHER THERE EXPLICITLY DESIGNATED AS A RELIGIOUS SCHOOL AND I WHICH PARK FEW WASN'T IT WAS THE ECUIVALENT OF A REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE YOUASS AND SINCE NINETY AT PER SEND O THE CHILDREN HAPPENED TO BE OF THESE LOMMING FAITH BACKGROUND WE OBVIOUSLY A CATRING FOR THE CONSTITUENCY THAT THE SCHOOL SERVS IN MINE WITH THE REGULATRY A REQUIREMENTS HERE DESCRIBED TO AN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY THAT THE WAY HE AND OTHER PARKFEW STAFF TALK ABOUT IT REMINDS ME OF AFERO CENTRIC OR BLACK EXCELLENT SCHOOLS IN THE YOUASK THAT STUDENTS WOULD DO BETTER ACCADEMICALLY WHEN THERE SCHOOLS IN CORPORAT AND CELEBRA WHO THEY ARE AND THERE'S RESEARCHS OF BACKS US UP SO UNDER TO HER'S LEADERSHIP PARKFEW ALLOWED STUDENTS TO PRAY IF THEY WANTED THEY INSTALD FACILITIES FOR RODE THE OBLUTIONS YOU DO BEFORE PRAYERS THEY CELEBRATED ROMADAN AND ALTERED THE SCHEDUAL DURING THAT MONTH TO FASILTA FASTING THEY SERVE TO WAL FOOD AND I FELT THAT I KNOW THIS WAS OR SCHOOL ONY WE WERE PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS IS OUR SCHOOL WE WANTED OUR CHILDREN TO SAY THAT THIS WAS THEIR SCHOOL AND THAT THEY WERE

THE BURNING HAM CITY COUNCIL APPOINTED ITS OWN SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR AND THEY SCRUTINIZED PARK VIEW ALONG THE TWENTY SOME OT OTHER SCHOOLS AND MUSLEN EIGHBORHOODS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAYLAY SOME POLITICIONS AND JOURNALIST WERE SAYING THAT THE LETTER ITSELF WAS LIKELY A HOAKS THERE WASE SOME OBVIOUS FACTUAL AND ACCURACIES YET THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVED IT STILL WARRANTED THIS ACTION HONESTLY I DON'T THINK ANY AUTHORITY EXPLAIN THIS LOGIC WITH MUCH CLARITY AT THE TIME BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE THINKING WENT AS IT EVEN IF THE LETTER ITSELF WASN'T AN ACTUAL COMMUNICAY BETWEEN TWO REAL LIFE CONSPIRATORS IT COULD STILL BE POINTING AT A REAL PROBLEM EVEN IF IT WAS FICTION THE THINKING WENT THE LETTER COULD HAV BEEN FABRICATED BY SOME ONE WHO HAD LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT MUSLEM EXTREMESTS SCHEMING AND WIELDING INFLUENCE IN SCHOOLS AND MAYBE THE LETTER WAS THEIR CREATIVE WAY OF RAISING AN ALARM SO RATHER THAN LOOK INTO WHO WROTE THE LETTER AND WHY INSTEAD THE GOVERNMENT PUT OUT GENERAL PUBLIC CAULS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THESE SCHOOLS AND PEOPLE STARTED COMING FORWARD MOSTLY ANONYMOUSLY WITH COM PLAINTS AGAIN INVESTIGATORS FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF RADICALIZATION NO EVIDENCE OF VIOLEN EXTREMISM AND NO PLOT WHAT EMERGED INSTEAD WAS A CANIC RAB BAG OF IS LOM ADJACENT ALLIGATIONS MANY OF THE SAME THINGS AUTHORITIES HAD CELEBRATED UP TO THAT POINT BUT APPARENTLY NOW WERE SEEING IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT LIKE THESE EDUCATORS WEREN'T MERELY ALLOWING STUDENTS TO PRAY THEY WERE PRESSURING THEM TO PRAY THEY WEREN'T INNOCENTLY RECRUITING BROUND MUSLIM STAFF THEY WERE HIRING THEIR BUDDIES WHO THOUGHT THE SAME WAY AS THEY DID AND POSSIBLY DISCRIMINATING AGAINST NONMUSLEM CANDIDATES IN THE PROCESS SCHOOL GOVERNORS INCLUDING TO HEAR THEY WEREN'T HOLDING HEAD TEACHERS TO A HIGH STANDARD THEY WERE PRESSURING THEM HARASSING THEM AND EXERCISING MORE POWER THAN A GOVERNOR WAS SPOSED TO INVESTIGATORS ALSO SAID THEY'D FOUND INSTANCES OF INTOLERANCE TOWARDS ELGI BITICUPEOPLE AND UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF WOMEN AND GIRLS THEY SAID PARKFIEW ID HELD ASSEMBLIES AND INVITED SPEAKERS WITH ANTI WESTERN VIEWS AND THAT THE HEAR AND PEOPLE ALINED WITH HIM A LEGEDLY SUBSCRIBED TO QUOTE AND IN TOLERANT AND POLITICIZED FORM OF EXTREME SOCIAL CONSERVATISM THAT CLAIMS TO REPRESENT AND ULTIMATELY SEEKS TO CONTROL ALL MUSLIMS ALL OF THIS AT THE THEN SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION PUT IT TAT SHE PRESENTED THE FINDINGS ON THE CHURGE IN HORSE LETTER TO PARLIAMENTS MENT THAT STUDENTS INSTEAD OF ENJOYING ABROLDENING AND INRICHING EXPERIENCE IN SCHOOL YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HAVING THAT HARISONS NARRITE AN OLBING DENIED OPPORTUNITY TO FLARISE IN A MORTI MO TO COUCHOVERSON IIT IS WUT IS REASON AND WITH DEEP SENSE OF INJUSTICE AND SADNESS THAT TO DAY WE ARE NOUCY ARE INTENTION TO RESIGN OUR

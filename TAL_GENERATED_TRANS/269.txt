SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS DOING IN HER SPARE TIME AND KIND OF TOOK OVER HER LIFE LISSE YELLOW BIRDS SEARCHES FOR MISSING PEOPLE PEOPLE NOBODY ELSE IS LOOKING FOR PEOPLE THE POLICE HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR A REPORTER SERA CRANE MURDA MATLESSON TWENTY FOURTEEN WONE SIERRA WAS LOOKING INTO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A YOUNG WHITE OIL WORKER CASY CLARK HED VANISHED COUPLE YEARS BEFORE ON THE RESERVATION WLISSES FROM IN NORTHTOCODA LISSA WAS INVESTIGETTING IT TO SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT OF PRISON SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A DISTRACTION AWAITIS STASE OBER AND AND SHE BISLY OPENED UP HER FILES TO ME AND ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE DEGREE TO WHIT SHE HAD INVOLVED HERSELF IN THIS CASE AND SHE HAD ACTUALLY SPEND YEARS AND SHE CRACKED THAT CASE THROUGH LIKE REALLY RE NOT TRADITIONAL MEANS LIKE BY BUSILY WAGING THIS CAMPEIN AGAINS THE PERISON WHO SHE BELIEVED HEN MURDERD CASY CLARK SHE LIKE MAILED TENS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FLIERS AROUND WESTERN NORTH THE CODA THE FIRE SA BEWARE WITH THE PHOTO OF THE GUY SHE THOUGHT MURDER CASIN CAR AND HIS WIFE IN THEY DID TURN PEOPLE AGAINST HIM BUT AT THE SAME TIME LISTI E FRIEND OF THE ONE THEY WERE TEXTING EACH OTHER ALMOST EVERY DAY AND THEY WERE TALKING ON CONSTANTLY AND SO SHE HAD THIS REALLY INTIMATE WINDOW INTO THE LIVES OF THESE PEOPLE SHE WAS TRYING TO INVESTIGATE AND THROUGH THAT WINDOW SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE THEIR OWNER ABILITYS SO THE SAME TIME THAT SHE WAS LIKE MAINTAINING THIS FO FRIENDSHIP WITH THIS WOMAND SHE WAS ALSO COMPLETELY UNDER MYNING HER AND HER HUSBAND AND THE CASE BROK OPEN SERRA SPENT YEARS WITH LISSA WATCHING THIS PLAY OUT AN ENDED UP WRITING A BOOK ABOUT LISSA IN THE CASE THEY GOT CLOSE SIERRA WOULD STAYLSS'S APARTMENT FOR MONTHS THEY DRIVED THROUGH THE BAD LANDS RUNNING DOWN WEEDS TALKED FOR HOURS EVERY WEEK WHEN SIERRA WASN'NT A NORTH TOCODA ANDURNG THISE YEARS THIS THING HAPPEN NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILYS STARTED ASKING LISSA TO LOOK FOR THEIR LOVED ONCE LISER'S A RICORA REMEMBER THE MAN DAN HO DOTS A RIKERANATION MEMBER LISSA WAS JUST KINE OF INVENTING HOW SHE DID THIS WOR FOR THIS SHE'D BEEN A WELDER A PRISON GUARD SOCIAL WORKER THIDSM WARM FORCEMENT WORK AND STUDY CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND COLLEGE BUT SHE'D ALSO BEEN A DRUGDEILER LISSA HAS LIVED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LAW WHICH IS WHAT MAKES HER SO GOOD AT WHAT SHE DOES AND SHE'S GONE TO PRISON YOU KNOW SHE SHE KNOWIS HOW LON FORCEMEN OPERATES FROM A PERPETRATOR'S POINT OF VIEW AS WELF IN DOZENS OF CASES NOW SOMEDIMES AN AROUND SOMETIMES WITH LOWN FORCEMEN LISSA HAS DEPLOYED THE SAME DOGGEDNESS AND RESOURCEFULNESS THAT SHE MARSHALLED IN THAT FIRST CASE LIK WERE EXAMPLE WHEN A WOMAN AMED O LIVIA ALONE BERE WHEN MISSING FROM LISS'S RESERVATION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WAS THIS NATIONAL SEARCH FOR HER BULISS'S THEORY WAS SHE MIGHT NOT BE FAR FROM HOME WHER SHE WAS LAST SCEN ONE DAY SHE DECIDE TO TAKE A BOAT OUT ON THE LIKE NEAR OLIVIA'S HOUSE WAS THE FISHING SONAR THAT SHE BOUGHT YEARS OR LIER THINKING SOME DAY IT MIGHT COME IN HANDY TO FIND MISSING PEOPLE SHE JUST LAUNCHED THE BOAT AND YAT WITHIN ABOUT TEN MINUTES HER YOUNGER RELATIVE SPOTTED SOME SHEEPE ON THE FISHING SOONER AND SAID HEANTY WHAT'S THAT AND A WITH THA LOOKED AT IT AND IT WAS A TRUCK AND AND A BULIVIA WAS INSIDE TONCE WE WERE THIS LISS A AND LIVIA'S FAMILY THI TRIED TO CONVINCE LON FORCEMAN AUTHORITIES TO LOOK IN THAT WAY LOTO NAM F AMERICANS CO MISSI AND I NEVER FOUND BUT EVEN HAVE GOOD STATISTICS ON THIS HES HER CASES ARE SO UNDER REPORTED AND POORLY TRACT BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM THERE THESE FEDERAL LAWS THAT LIMIT WHO CAN INVESTIGATE CASES AND HOW THEY CAN INVESTIGATE THEM ON RESERVATIONS WHICH LEADS YOU A JURISDICTIONAL TANGLE IT'S OFTEN NOT CUEER WHICH LAN FORCEMAN AGENCY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE A CASE IF YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY DISAPPEARED FROM ONOR RESERVATION OR OFFER RESERVATION IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY THAT CASES O THE RESERVATION TRIABLL POLICE WOT THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES OFF THE RESERVATION SIDY YOUR COUNTY OR STATE POLICE BUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S SO UNCLEAR THOSE CASES CAN BECOME A LOT LOWER PRIORITY OR THOSE CASES CAN BE IGNORED BY ALL JURISTICTIONS AND AND THAT'S WHERE LISSA YELLOW BIRD COMES IN YOU KNOW SHE SEARCHES FOR THE PEO WHO SLIP THROUGH THESE TURS TI TIONAL CRAFTS      SO WIS TIS TURE YOU BOT TO TELL SON'T TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LISSAS OWN NESE WENT MISSING AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE WHEN SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE WHO WASN'T A STRANGER SHE JUST LIKE NEVER EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER OWN RELATIVE AM BUT THIS CASEIS REALLY REMARKABLE FOR A LOT OF REASONS A FOR ONE SHE FIGURED IT OUT IN JUST FIVE DAYS AM SHE ALSO RECORDED ALL OF HER CONVERSATION WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WAS AT DOES A LOT SHE SAVES EVERYTHING SHE PHOTOCRAFTS EVERYTHING SHE RECORDS EVERYTHING AND LESS HA GAVE ME THESE PHONE CALLS THAT SHE RECORDED OVER THE COURSE OF THESE FINVE DAYS AND THEY WERE JUST INCREDIBLE A BECAUSE THEY REALLY SHOWED CON HOW SHE WAS ABLE TO BREAK THIS CASE OPEN AN A MEED IT BY MINUTE WAY SHERE SAYS ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS CASE SHE ENLESS A TALK FOR HOURS ALL THE TIME ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT AFTER THIS FIVE DAYS WHEN LISTLE WAS WORK IN THIS CASE SHE JUST COME WENT QUIET ABOUT IT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT FOR YEARS WHICH JUS REALLY UNUSUAL BECAUSE LISA IS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HER CASES AM SHE JUST NEVER TALKED ABOUT THIS CASE AGAIN THOUGH AND I I KNEW THAT I I KNEW BECAUSE SHE WAS SO QUIET ABOUT IT AND I KNEW ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS OWN HER OWN RELATIVE THAT IT HAD AFFECTED HER IN A WAY THAT NO OTHER CASE HAD AM I BUT I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHY ENTIRELY LIKE I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON AND THREE YEARS PASSED AM AND THAT WAS WHEN SHE FINALLY SAID OKI YE I'M READY TO TALK ABOUT IT AND SHE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT SHRES IT GESS TO DOING A STORY LIS IS SAID YES

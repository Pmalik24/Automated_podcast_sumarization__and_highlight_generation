IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIFE FROM W EASY CHICAGO A'M SUSAN BURTON SITTING IN FOR IR GLAST TO DAY THEREARE THESE VIDIOS I'VE BEEN WATCHING VITTIOS A FEMALE POLITICIANS TELLING VERY PERSONAL STORIES HERE'S ONE OF THEM VEN WORD IT SHOWS GRETCHEN WHITHER SHE'S NOW THE GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN BUT SHE'S SPEAKING HERE A FEW YEARS AGO AND SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE I'VE ST IT BEFORE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST MESACHINISIT PROPOSALS I'VE EVER SEEN IN THE MICHICAN LEGISLATURE WHITMER'S EXPLAINING WHY SHE'S LOTING NO ON A BILL THAT WOULD FORBID WOMEN FROM USING INSURANCE TO COVER ABORTIONS UNLESS THEY BOUT SEPARATE ABORTION INSURANCE WHAT WHITMER CALLS RAPE INSURANCE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO ACT A GAST THAT I'D USE A TERM LIKE RAPE IN SURANCE TO DESCRIBE THE PROPOSAL HERE IN FRONT OF US YOU SHOULD BE EVEN MORE OFFENDED THAT IT'S ABSOLLUTELY ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THIS PROPOSAL REQUIRES THIS TELLS WOMEN THAT WERE RATE AND BECAME OT MET THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT I HAD AND BOUGHT SPECIAL INSURANCE FOR IT SHE'S BEEN TALKING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WHEN SUDDENLY SHE STOPS SETS HER PAPERS DOWN I'VE A LOT MORE PREPARED REMARKS HERE BUT I THINK AT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO JUST MENTURED A COUPLE FACE SO I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT I'VE NOT SHARE WITH MANY PEOPLE IN MY WIFE BUT OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO I WAS A VICTIM OF RATE I THANK GOT IT DIDN'T RESOLT IN A PREGNATCY IS I CAN'T IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH AND THEN HABEEN TO CONSIDER WHAT TO DO ABOUT AN UNWANTED PREGNANTCE BROM AN A TACKER THE WHOLE TIME WITMER TALKS SHE GRIPPS THE SIDES OF THE LECTURE HER FACE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S IN PAIN  I HAV NOT INJOIN TALKING ABOUT IT IT'S SOMETHING I'VE HIDDEN FOR A LONG TIME BUT I THINK YOU MEED TO SEE THE FACE OF THE WOMEN THAT YOU ARE IMPACTING BY THIS FOT TO DAY I HAVE SET BY COMMENTS BE MY NOBLED EXPLANATION MY NO VOTE EXPLANATION SHE SAYS WHITMER STORY WASN'T PLAN SHE SAID LATER THAT SHE DECIDED TO TELL HER SECRET IN THAT MOMENT STANDING AT THE LIHT AS SOON AS SHE LEFT THE FLOOR AND GOT INTO RE CAR WHITMER CALLED HER FATHER SHE'D NEVER TOLD HIM THAT SHE'D BEEN RATE SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO HEAR ABOUT IT ON THE NEWS THAT NIGHT SHE HADN'T EXPECTED TO TELL THE MISSHICAN LEGISLATURE BEFORE SHE TOLD HIM I WONDERED IF THE CALL TO HER FATHER WAS HARDER I THINK IT' SOMETIMES EASIER TO TELL A SECRET IN PUBLIC THAN IN PRIVATE SAFER TO HAVE THAT DISTANCE WHEN I FIRST SAW WHITMERS VETIOU A YEAR AGO I WAS ON THE VERGE OF REVEALING A SECRET IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY IN A BOOK THAT WAS ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED I'D WRITTEN A MEMOIR ABOUT MY EATING DISORDER AND UNTIL RECENTLY THAT EATING DISORDER IT HAD BEEN A SECRET FROM EVERY ONE IN MY LIFE SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY EVERY ONE AND THEN FOLLOW IT WITH AN ACCEPT LIKE EXCEPT MY MAM AN MY BEST FRIEND I REALLY DO MEAN EVERY ONE NOT EVEN MY HUSBAND KNEW AND WE'D BEEN TOGETHER FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'D NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT AND I'D ALSO NEVER BEEN IN THERAPY FOR IT WHEN I FINALLY DID SEE HELP I WAS FORTY FIVE IN THE VERY FIRST SESSION MY THERABIST TRYING TO GET THE STORY STRAIT IR MAY BE JUST TRYING TO GET ME TO HEAR HOW ABSURD THE SOUNDAT SAID YOU WROTE A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT THIS BUT YOU'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT WITH ANY ONE THAT WAS RIGHT I'D GONE TO SEE THE THRABIST PARTLY BECAUSE IT DID SEEM KIND OF MEST UP TO ME WHEN I DONE I KNEW IT WAS JUST AS URGENT TO UNDER STAND MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SECRETS AS MY RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD THAT'S WHERE I WAS WHEN I WATCH WHITMER SPEECH THINKING A LOT ABOUT SECRETS AND WHY WE TELL THEM AND THE FORM THEY TAKE WHEN WE DO WHAT MADE WHITMER SPEECH SO POWERFUL WAS THAT HER SECRET WAS NOT JUST A CONFESSION IT WAS AN ARGUMENT IT WAS TOLD TO PERSUADE I WAS MOVED BY HER VIDIO AND I WENT LOOKING FOR OTHERS LIKE IT OF COURSE POLITICIANS TELL PERSONAL STORIES AND SPEECHES ALL THE TIME BUT DISCLOSING SOMETHING YOU'VE KEPT PRIVATE FOR YEARS AND DOING IT IN A LEGISLATIVE SESSION SOMETIMES SPONTANEOUSLY THAT'S PRETTY KNEW ALMOST EVERY EXAMPLE I TURNED UP WAS ABOUT SECUAL TRAMA WHICH I MEAN THERE ARE BUNCH OF REASONS FOR THIS BUT A BIG ONE IS THE INCREASING NUMBER OF BILLS THAT TRYD TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO ABORTION I WATCHD BIDIOS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TVICTORIOUS DEAL IN ARIZONA THERESA FETTER AN OHIO MANDY WRIGHT AND WAS CONSON MANCY MACE SIN SOUTH CAROLINA ONE OF THE THINGS I WONDERED ABOUT WAS WHAT PROMPTED THEM TISE LIKE WHAT EXACTLY MADE THEM STAND UP AND SAY IT OF COUPLE SAID THEY WERE INFURIATED BY THE CONVERSATION IN THE ROOM COMMENTS LIKE WOMEN LIE ABOUT BEING RATE AND I WONDERED WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO SAY THE SECRET HENE NEWLEY KNEW DISCLOSED TO THE NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY THAT AT EIGE THIRTEEN SHE'D BEEN ABUSE BY A TEACHER SHE DREW ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN HER BODY AS SHE SPOKE I NEVER SPEAK I AIT OR THIS RIS BECAUSE I HODER I CESHI  SEE WHAT JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THERE WAS ANOTHER SIMILAR VIDO THAT GOT A LOT OF A TENSION FROM NEW YORK CONGRESS WOMAN ALEXANDRIA OCASSIO CORTEZ SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THE RIOTE AT THE CAPITAL AND THEN CHARNEVIALED THIS AM IMA SURVIVER I SACTUALS AND I HAVEN'T TOLD MANY PEOPLE BAT IN MY WIFE AM OF COSSIO CARTEZ DIDN'T SAY THIS IN A LEGISLATIVE SESSION HERVIDIO WAS ON INSTOGRAMLIVE BUT IT FELT LIKE THE OTHERS I' WATCHED AND THAT SHE WAS USING HER SECRET TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT IN THIS CASE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TRAMA THAT DIFFERENT KINDS OF TRAMA COMPOUND ON EACH OTHER SHE AND THE OTHERS SPOKE OUT BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT AT STAKE THEY DISCLOSED THEIR SECRETS AS A PUBLIC SERVICE OF COURSE FROR MOST OF US THE REASONS WE TELL SECRETS THEY'RE NOT A STRAIGHTFORWARD MY OWN REASONS FOR TELLING MY SECRET I CAN'T EVEN CALL THEM REASONS THAT'S TOO RATIONAL WHAT I HAD WAS AN URGE TO TELL ONE DRIVEN BY DESPERATION OBSESSION ANGER ELONGING TO BE KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF SECRETS AND ALL KINDS OF REASONS FOR TELLING AND NOT TELLING THAT'S OUR SHOW THIS WEEK WHY WE TELL SECRETS AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE DO STAY WITH US  ACT ONE MY OWN VERY SERIOUS COMEDY ABOUT WOMEN AND FOOD SO LET'S GET IN TO WHY YOU MIGHT HOLD ON TO A SECRET WHY IT MIGHT BE SO HARD TO TELL AND IF YOU HAVEN AN EATING DISORDER OR AREIN RECOVERY FOR A ONE A HEADS UP THAT THEIR STUFF IN HERE THAT COULD BE TRIGGERING I WANT O STARP BY TELLING YOU ABOUT A MOVI ONE THAT I SAW AS A TEA NAGURE ONE THAT ADDRESSED MY SECRET DIRECTLY IT WAS

FEELS LIKE A DOCUMENTARY BECAUSE A LOT OF IT IS WOMEN STARING INTO THE CAMERA TELLING PERSONAL STORIES ABOUT FOOD THE SETTING IS A FORTIETH BIRTHDAY PARTY IN LAW SANGALIS AND ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS IS A FILM MAKEER NAMED MARTINE SHE'S MAKING A DOCUMENTARY TO HELP HER UNDERSTAND HER OWN EATING DISORDER IDENTIFIED WITH THAT AT FIRST MARTINE TELLS EVERYONE OF THE PARTY THAT HER FILM IS

DIT THAT'S A CAVE IT'S IT'S LIKE EN O KIND OF INTERESTIN IT JUS SAY A YOU NOT EATING DESORDER AS AS ONE WE AT AS IS THAT'S SO UNATTRACTIVE IT'S SO DISTURBING AT JUS IT WAS THEVER ABLE TO TEN AS ANY ONE AN LOTS OF WAYS THIS MOVI IS DATED AND JUDG MENTAL BUT IT'S UNAPOLOGETICALLY ABOUT EATING WHICH STILL FEELS RATICAL ONE BY ONE THE WOMEN COME AND SIT BEFORE MARTINE'S CAMERA AND SHE ASKS THEM TELL ME DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM ABOUT FOOD AT THE END OF THE MOVI SHE SAYS THAT HEARING THEIR STORIES HAS CHANGE THINGS FOR HER AND I FEEL SO CROSE WIT HEM IT'S SUCH A WONDERFUL FEELING AN IF WE FEEL I DON'T WANT TO BE ALON ANY MORE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THINGS WITH OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW MAYBE THE SOUND SAPPY BUT THESE LINES DID SOMETHING TO ME IT'S WHAT I WANTED TOO I WANTED MARTINE TO INVITE ME TO SIT IN FRONT OF HER CAMERA AND ASK DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM ABOUT FOOD I WANTED TO BE MARTINE ASKING OTHERS THAT QUESTION I WANTED TO BE AT THE PARTY WITH OTHER WOMEN TALKING I CLOSED MY LAPTOP I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO THE KITCHEN AND FROM THE FREEZER I TOOK OUT A LEMONBAR THE SIZE OF A CHECKERBOARD SQUARE I PUT THE LEMON BAR ON A PLATE THE SIZE OF SOMETHING A CHILD WOULD USE AT A TEA PARTY I LIKE THE BARNE TO STRIPS AND THEN IT'S TINY BITES I SAT AT THE TABLE AN I ATE ALL THE BITES THEN I WANTED MORE BUT I WOUN'T LET MYSELF HAVE IT BY THIS POINT I'D HAD ENOUGH THERAPY TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT I DID WITH FOOD WAS WHAT I DID WITH PEOPLE FEAR FULL OF CONNECTION BUT SO HUNGRY FOR IT SITTIG AT THE TABLE I STARTED A FANTO SIGNCS ABOUT MAKING MY OWN VERSION OF THE FILL A RADIO VERSION I WANTED TO HAVE A PARTY LIKE IN THE MOVI THOUGH I DID KNOW WHO AD INVITE I YEAR PASSED I GOT A LITTLE BETTER I TOLD PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME ABOUT MY HISTORY I TOLD OTHERS I TALKED MORE THEN MY MEMOR WAS PUBLISHED I'D EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM READERS WHO CONNECTED WITH MY EXPERIENCE OF AN EATING DISORDER WAT SURPRISE ME WAS HOW MANY ALSO CONNECTED WITH MY EXPERIENCE OF NOT TALKING ABOUT IT I REALIZED HERE WERE MY PARTY GUESTS I YEMELLED THE BACK WITH INVITATIONS TO SPEAKI NAT REALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WHAT'S WITH ANOTHER PERSON WHO AS SAPR FOR MEOU DSURTER AND IT SOUNDS WHY OU TOET THAT TAT IT'S TRUE I THINK

INTERACIOUSIDE OF IT I THINK HI IT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK YOUR SHALLOW I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THEY GO WAS SHE JUST WANTS TO BE SKITTY AND WITH THE BINGI TO ANY ONE THATS NEVER EXPERIENCED IT YOU SOUD OUT OF YOUR MIND IT JUST IT DOESNIT MAKE AN Y Y SENS AT ALL AN EEW WHEN YOU EXPLAIN IT LIKE IVS THE IT'S IN EDDICTION WHATEVER MAY BE PEOPLEL HAVE SOME BETTER SENS OF IT BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HELPFUL TO TALK TO SOMEWHAT HAS BEEN THERE I THINK I MEAN ATHING FOR ME LIKE ONE OTHER REASONS WHI HAVEN'T BEEN AV ALTILL I TALKED ME THERE OR PEST ABOUT IT AND GETLY CREELIE

WOMAN WHO SHARED THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING AN EATING DISORDER UT ALSO I THINK IT GETS AT SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT WHY WE KEEP ANY KIND OF SECRET THE CONVERSATION STARTED THE SAME WAY AS ALL OF THEM WITH AUDRY THAT'S NOT HER REAL NAME TELLING ME THE HISTORY OF HER EATING DISORDER I THOUGHT NOBODY ELSE HAD EVER DONE THAT I I'D NEVER HEARD OF BELEMIA I THI THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHE AVE IT HAD EVER DONE THAT AUDRIA SIXTY THREE AND SHE STARTED BEENGING IN PURGING IN COLLEGE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THIS WAS BEFORE EATING DISORDERS WERE ON AFTERSCHOAL SPECIALS BEFORE BELEMIA HAD BEEN DEFINED IN A PSYCHOLOGICAL JOURNAL I WONDERED HOW AUDRE HAD GOTTEN THE IDEA BUT OID YOU REMEMBER HOW IT OCCURRED TO YOU TO DO IT TO PURGE I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER THE INITIAL TIME BUT I HAD BEEN

POSITIVE FEED BACK FROM STRANGERS WAS ENCOURAGING OVERWHELMING BUT HEARING FROM PEOPLE I KNEW FELT EMBARRASSING EXPOSING FORTUNATELY IT WASN'T THAT MANY PEOPLE  WENT BACK TO PASTLING OUT THE TELLINGS

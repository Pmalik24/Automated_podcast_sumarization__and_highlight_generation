WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN APONEN STESTCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO RI MANDEUR HUBERMEN AND ON MOUR PROFESOR OF NORBIOLOGY AND OPTIMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TODAY MY GUESS IS DOCTOR CILD GELETTE DOCTOR CAWGELETTE IS A DUAL BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICION IN FAMILY MEDICINE AND OBISITY MEDICINE AND EXPERT IN HORMON OPTIMIZATION HE IS AN MDE THAT IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR AND HE TREATS PATIENCE WITH A VARIETY OF BACKGROUNDS AGES AND GOALS TODAY WE DISCUSS MALE HORMONOPTIMIZATION WE DISCUSS BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NUTRITION BASE TOOLS SUPPLEMENT BASE TOOLS PRESCRIPTION DRUG BASE TOOLS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS IN DETERMINING OVERALL LEVELS OF TESTASTRONE FREE TESTASTRONE DIHYDROTESTOSTRON ESTERGEN GROWTH HORMON THIRID HORMONE AND MANY OTHER HORMONES THE IMPACT MOOD LEBIDO WELL BEING STRENGTH COGNITION AND VARIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WE COVERED HORMONOPTIMIZATION IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IN PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THE HUBERMAN LABPOD CAST BUT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS DIFFERENT DOCTOR CAWGELETTE OFFERS VERY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT GOALS AND OF DIFFERENT AGES AND WE GET DEEP INTO THE WEEDS OF FOR INSTANCE HOW DOES ONE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEIR TESTASTRONE IS OPTIMIZED OR NOT HOW OFTEN TO TEST FOR SPECIFIC HORMON SUCH AS TESTASTRONE AND OTHER HORMONES AND REALLY HOW TO GAGE HOW GOOD ONE SHOULD FEEL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S OFTEN OVERLOOKED IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HORMONOPTIMIZATION OR HEALTH OPTIMIZATION OF ANY KIND FOR THAT MATTER FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT REDUCED LEBIDO AND DISCAS WEATHER OR NOT TESTSTRON LEVELS ARE TO BLAME BUT HOW DOES ONE CALIBRATE THEIR LEBIDO IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IS HOW DOES ONE KNOW WHETHER NOT THEIR LEBIDO IS NORMAL TOO LO OR TOO HIGH WE ALSO DISCUSS FOR INSTANCE WHETHER OR NOT HORMONOPTIMIZATION SHOULD BE PURSUED CONTINUALLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR FOR INSTANCE WHETHER NOT YOU SHOULD CYCLE ON AND OFF SUPPLEMENTS AND OR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS GEAR TOWARDS HORMONOPTIMIZATION AND WE DISCUSS THE BEHAVIORAL FOUNDATIONS OF OPTIMO HORMON FUNCTION THESE ARE THINGS THAT EVERY MALE SHOULD BE DOING AND VARIOUS THINGS THEY SHOULD ACTIVELY AVOID IF THEIR GOAL IS TO HAVE HEALTHY HORMONES AND TO QUOTENQUOT OPTIMIZE THEIR LEVELS OF EVERY HORMN FROM GROWTHORMON TO TESTASTRONE AT ANY STAGE OF LIFE AND WHILE TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS ABOUT MALE HORMONOPTIMIZATION I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE DISCUSS ALL THE VARIOUS AGES FOR MALE HORMONOPTIMIZATION SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE PARENTS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE YOUNG THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE MIDDLE AGE ARE OLD OR TEAN AGERS WE EXPLORE ADOLESCENT PUBERTY TEEN AND LATETEENS EARLY ADULTHOOD ADULTHOOD AND INTO THE LATE GERIATRIC AGES SO REGARDLESS OF YOUR AGE AND WETHER NOT YOUR MALE OR FEMALE TO DAY'S EPISODE OUGHT TO BE OF INTEREST TO YOU I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE WILL SOON ALSO BE HOSTING AN EXPERT GUEST ON FEMALE HORMON OPTIMIZ ATION ONE THING THAT I'M CERTAIN PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND BIOLOGICAL SEX WILL ENJOY ABOUT TODAY'S CONVERSATION IS THAT WE ALSO GET INTO DESCRIPTIONS OF HOW PSYCHOLOGY AND LIFE EVENTS IMPACED HORMONES AND HOW HORMONES IMPACT OUR PSYCHOLOGY AND THE WAY THT WE SHOW UP TO VARIOUS LIFE EVENTS SO TODAY IS REALLY A BROAD OVER VIOW THAT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO FINE DETAILS ABOUT MAL HORMONE OPTIMIZATION AND I'M CERTAIN THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF NEW INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS ENDERCRIN THAT IS HORMONE SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY WORKS AND HOW WOULD INTERACTS WITH YOUR BRAIN AND OTHER TISSUES AND MANY MANY ACTIONAL TOOLS THAT YOU CAN PURSUE REGARDLESS OF STAGE OF LIFE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE T EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION

SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR CALGELETTE DOCTOR GELETT GREAT HAVE YOU BACK GREAT TO BE BACK THANK YOU I LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A QUESTION ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST MYSTERIOUS AND IMPORTANT PHASES OF LIFE WHICH IS PUBERTY I'VE LONG WONDERED WHETHER OR NOT HOW QUICKLY SOMEBODY GOES INTO PUBERTY SO AT WHAT AGE AND HOW LONG PUBERTY TAKES SO HOW BRIEF R PROTRACTO THAT PUBERITY IS FOR THEM TO REQUIRE THE SOCAL SECONDARY SECTUAL CHARACTERISTICS THINGS LIKE HERE GROWTH ON THE PHACE FOR MAILS A CHANGES IN BONE AND MUSCLE DENSITY AN GROWTH ET CETERA NO NOWAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL I NOTICE THAT SOME PEOPLE TRANSITION AND ALL THAT VERY FAST AND SOME PEOPLE I TOOK A LONG TIME TO ACQUIRE THOSE CHARACTERISTICS CAN WE LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT OUR SELVES OUR HORMONES AND MAYBE EVEN HOW LONG WERE OING TO LIVE BASED ON THE TIME IN WHICH WE ENTER PUBERTY AND HOW LONG IT TAKES US TO PROGRESS THROUGH PUBERTY I GUESS THAT ALSO RAISES THE QUESTION DOES PUBERTY EVER TRULY END THERERE MANY TAKE AWAYS FROM PUBERTY A SOME OF THE ACTIONABLE ITEMS FROM IT IS YES IT CAN AND DOES EFFECT YOUR ADULT HEIGHT AND ALSO STATURE AND ALSO BODY COMPOSITION SO PUBERTY IS A TIME A AND IF YOUR IVERE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT MALES THINK OF IT AS A A TIME WHERE IF YOU HAVE OBICITY IS A CHILD YOU COULD POTENTIALLY USE THAT TIME TO CHANGE YOUR LASTYLE AND HABITS AND RESET THINGS AND IT IS A BIT EASIER SOMULSLIKE A A FREE INJECTION OF TASTOSTERONE AND METABOLISM AND DRIVE AND EFFORT ANTER LIFE THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION AND A HOW QUICKLY PUBERTY GOES THROUGH SO THEIR STAGES CALLED TANNER STAGES WHICH WE DON'T NECESSARILY TO GET INTO BUT IF YOU INTER PUBRTY VERY EARLY THEN IT CAN A DECREASE YOUR ADULT HEIGHT OR STATURE SO FOR A GIVEN MAL THAT ENTERS PUBERTY AT THIRTEEN VERSES OF MALE THAT ENTERS PUBERTY AT FIFTEEN CAN WE SAY THAT THE GUY THAT ENTERED PUBERTY AT THIRTEEN IS GOING TO BE SHORTER THAN THE GUY THAT ENTERED PUBERTY AT FIFTEEN OR IT'S NOT QUITE THAT STRAIGHT FORWARD IF THEY ARE IDENTICAL TWINS AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO INTERPUBERTY AT AGED THIRTEEN ALSO FINISHED PUBERTY WHEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE TANNER STAGES AND IF YOU DO A BONE SCAN WHICH I BELIEVE IS USUALLY DONE ON THE LEFT TO WRIST AND IS SAYS YESTYOUR GROWTH PLACEER MUSTLY CLOSED YOU'RE NOT CAN A GROW MORE THAN A COUPLE INCHES OF HEIGHT AFTER THAT UT JUST A RELATED QUESTION WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IT WAS THOUGHT OR AT LEAST PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT RESISTANCE TRAINING IN PARTICULAR LIFTING HEAVY WEIGHTS COULD STUNT ONE'S GROWTH IS THAT TRUE WERE FALSE IT IS FALSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST LIFTING HEAVY WEITS DIRTY BULKING CERTAINLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO STUNT ONE'S GROWTH FOR IT FORTWUMAINE MECHANISM COULD YOU DEFINE DIRTY BULKING SE A DIRTY BULKING IS EATING AN EXCESS OF CALORIES NOT JUST TO ACQHUIRE LEAN METABOLICALLY ACT IVE BODY MASS OR GET STRONGER BUT APURPOSELY ACQUIRING BODY FAT SO PURPOSELY ACQUIRING MUSCLE AND FAT BY OVEREATING YES AND LIFTING WEIGHTS CAN STUN ONE'S GROWTH DO I HAVE THAT CORRECT CORRECT SO DOES TWO THINGS IF YOU'RE DOING AT IS A VERY YOUNG CHILD IT CAN THAT FAT CAN PERCAN BECOME LEAPT IN RESISTANT AND IT CAN PRODUCE MORE LEPT AN AN THAT LEAPT IN CAN ACTIVATE THE HYPOTHALEMIS WHICH ACTIVATES THE PTUITARY WHICH RELEASES CANNATATROPENS WHICH BASICALLY JUST INCREASED TESTOSTRON AN ESTROGEN EARLIER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE IT'S THE SAME MECHANISM BEHIND WHY CHILDHOD O B CITY CAUSES EARLY PUBERTY INTERESTING I DO REMEMBER A PAPER PUBLISH IN SCIENCE MAGAZINE I BELIEVE IT WAS FOCAS MAINLY ON FEMALES BUT SHOWING THAT WHEND ENOUGH BODY FAT ACCUMULATES THE HORMONE LEAPTIN IS SECRETED IN THAT TRIGGERS THE ONSET OF PUBERTY GIVIN THE INCREASE IN A CHILDHOOD OB CITY THAT WE'RE OBSERVING NOW ARE WE SEEING AND EARLIOR ONSET OF PUBERTY IN MALES AND FEMALES YES AND BOTH MALES AND FEMALES NOT TO GET TOO TEPTICAL BUT THERE'S A GEEP PROTINE COUPLED RECEPTOR ON THE HYPOTHALEMIS AND LEAPT IN DIRECTLY BINDS IT SO IT DOES APPEAR DIRECTLY COSITORY AND NOT JUST CORRELATION OCASO AN IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS FOR A YOUNG GILET'S A THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WHO WANTS TO REALLY BULK UP AND DELIBERATELY DELIBERATELY SCUSE ME OVEREATS AND IS DOING THERE SQUATS AND DEDLIF SAND BENCH PRESSES AND REALLY TRINING GET BIG THEY WILL GET BIG BUT ONLY IN THE LATTER AL DIMENSION THEY ARE NOT THEIR EFFECTIVELY LIMITING THEIR TOTAL HEIGHT AND IT CAN SHUT DOWN THE LONG BONE GROWTH  OF THEIR LIMBS IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT THE THE GROWTH OF HE LONGBONES IS MOSTLY RELATED TO THE ESTRODYLE ALFA RECEPTER SO BASICALLY ONE OF THE RECEPTORS FOR ESTRGEN WHICH CAN BE SECONDARY TO AF EARLY PUBERTY AND ALSO IS RELATED TO BODY FAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERUM TO ESTRGEN SO CAN WE ASSUME THAT IF A YOUNG MALE WANTS TO GET INTO RESISTANCE TRAINING THAT BODY WEIGHT EXERCISES ARE PROBABLY O QE AND MAYBEVEN SOME WIGHT TRAINING KETTLE BELLS ET CETERA BUT THAT THEY SHOULD AVOID DOING SO CALLED DIRTY BULKING TRYING TO DELIBERATELY GAIN WEIGHT UP UNTIL WHAT AGE UNTIL PUBERTY IS OVER I WOULD SAY AN INDIVIDUAL SHOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF A BODY ABNORMAL BODY FAT ACCUMULATION OR DIRTY BULKING ANDEFINITELY THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SO AGAIN IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT RECOMMENDATION TO AVOID DELIBERATE WEIGHT GAIN OR RAPID WEIGHT GAIN IS NOT JUST TO ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL TO REACH THEIR MAXIMUM HEIGHT BUT ALSO TO AVOID LAYING DOWN A LOT OF BODY FAT CELLS CORRECT CORRECT THE BALANCE BETWEEN THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE GOING THROUGH PUBERTY YOU ARE ABLE TO ADD A LOT OF LEAN BODY MASS NOT JUST MUSCLE MASS BUT BONE MASS AND OTHER MASS AS WELL I STARTED LIFTING WEIGHTS WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN AND I CONFESS I TRAIN PRETTY HEAVY AT TIMES AI DON'T KNOW WHETHER NOT I WOULD HAVE BEEN TALLER I THAN I AM NOW BUT WHEN I STARTED THAT TRAINING I HAD ALREADY REACHED WHUT WAS AT LEAST CLOSE TO MY PREDICTED HEIGHT IM I CAN'T SAY THAT I DELIBERALELY WAITED UNTIL I GROWN IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT I STUMBLED INTO THE WEIGHT ROOM AND FOUND THAT I LIKED IT AT AGE SIXTEEN IT WHICH POINT I WAS ALREADY I THAT I AM NOW SO IN ANY CASE IM WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT LAYING DOWN A LOT OF EXCESS BAT BODY FAT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA WHAT IF SOMEBOD Y GROWS UP CHUBBY OR FAT A FOR WHATEVER REASON A REASONS RELATE TO THE EATING PATTERNS IN THEIR FAMILY MAYBENSOM GENETIC REASONS IS IT SAFE AND OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PERSON STO LET SAY SOMEBODY WHOSE AROUND THE AGE OF PUBERTY OR EVEN YOUNGER IT WERE IN THEIR LATETEENS TO BEDUIDING AND ACTIVELY TRYING TO LOSE BODY FAT IS THAT SAFE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF E PHYSICIAN IT IS CERTAINLY SAFE TO CHANGE YOUR BODY COMPOSITION IN PEDIATRICO B SCITY MEDICINE YOU'RE OFTEN TALKING ABOUT A RECOMPOSITION OR A RENORMALIZATION OF THE GROWTH CURVE COMPARED TO PIERCE THANK YOU SO AS YOU MAY HAVE SENSE WE STARTED CHRONOLOGICALLY WITH PUBERTY AND I KNOW THAT THEREIS ANOTHER PUBERTY THAT EVEN PRECEDES THE PUBERTY THAT WERE LL FAMILIAR WITH A MAYBE FEU ANGES BRIEFLY MENTION THAT CAS OS TALKING WIT YOU ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE STARTED AM THE PUBERTY THAT I'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE ORE MOST FAMILIAR WITH THAT ACQUISITION OF DEEPENING OF THE VOIS A GROWTH O MUSCLE AND BONE A A BODY HER ACQUISITION OF LIBIDO IN THINKS LIKE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SECOND PUBERTY THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH OU WE JUST MENTION FOR US AND EDUCATE US ON THE FIRST PUBERTY I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL BE AM I HERING THIS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME THE FIRST PUBERTY OF EVERYONE'S LIFE IS THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THEIR LIFE YOU MAY NOTICE THAT YOUR BABY HAS MORE ACTNING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS AND THAT THEY ALSO HAVE A IN GENERAL JUST MORE CHANGES RELATED TO ANTRGENS AND ESTROGENS PERHAPS OILER SKIN  EVEN MORE GENITR NERCGENITALE GROWTH DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS AND THIS IS MOSTLY U T D  T E WHICH IS IN A DRENAL HORMONE THE SECOND PUBERTY OR THE PUBERTY THAT MOST PEOPLE KNOW OF ACTUALLY STARTS THAT SAME WAY AS WELL IT'S CALLED ADRONARCHY AN IT'S WHEN THE A DRENALS KICK IN A I GUESS FOR THE SECOND TIME IS THERE A STANDARD AGE OR AGE RANGE IN WHICH THE TESTICLES DESCEND IN MALES USUALLY BEFORE BIRTH A IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE ONE OR EVEN TO UNDISCENDED TESTIES BUT THERE IS A RISK OF TESTICULAR CANCER ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE NOT FIXED EARLY AND ALSO HEAT DAMAGE TO THE TESTY WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT COVERAGE OF THE TWO PUBERTIES SO EARLY IN LIFE I IMAGIN SOME OF OUR LISTENERS BUT PROBABLY A STILL IN WONOR THE T WONE OF THE OTHER PUBRTY THE ONE THARE IN THE FIRST PUBERTY OVISE REN'T AWARE THAT THEIR IN LISTENING TO THIS PODCAST BUT MAYBE WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THEIR SUBCONSCIOUS BUT SOME A LISTENERS PROBABLY ARE STILL IN PUBERTY BUT I THINK EVERYONE CAN REMEMBER BACK TO THEIR PUBERTY AND ROUGHLY WHEN THEY FIRST ENTERED PUBERTY AND HOW QUICKLY THEY AGGREGATED THE SECONDARY SEX A CHARACTERISTICS LIKE TO TURN NOW TO A GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT WHAT ALL MALES OUGHT TO DO IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THEIR HORMONTHS I S IF YOU COULD JUST LIST OFF THE THINGS THAT ALL MALES SHOULD DOU ON A DAILY BASIS WEEKLY BASIS I MEAN SHOULD GUISE IN THEIR TEENS AND TWENTIES BE GETTING THEIR BLOOD WORKED ON SHOULD THEY BE TAKING SUPPLEMENTS WE REY TALKED ABOUT WEIGHT TRAINING WHAT SHOULDTHEY BE DOING WHAT SHOULD THEY OF WAI DOING IF THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A LONG ARC OF HEALTHY HORN ON OPTIMIZATION THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPENT THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD DO ANANALOGY THAT I OFTEN MAKE IS WHEN THERE'S A BRAND NEW CAR THAT COMES OFF THE ASSEMBLY LINE YOU DO A FULL SCOPE OF DIAGNOSTIC WORK UP HOOK AT UPS THE COMPUTER AND I THINK WE HOU DO THE SAME THING WITH HUMANS AS WELL DEAR MPUBERTY YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A FUNCTIONING PUMAN BUT I WOULD SAY THERE'S STILL DEVELOPMENT AND I THINK THAT THE THE HUMAN ALWAYS DEVELOPS I DON'T THINK DEVELOPMENT EVER INDS BUT YOU AN A MONOTURE THAT PROGRESS ACROSS A PERSON'S LIFE SPAN SOOS ARRY SO FOR BLOOD WORK A WHAT WOULD BE THE EARLIEST A LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY IF BLOOD WORK DIDN'T COST ANYTHING AND EVERYONE COULD GET IT WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE EVERYBODY GET THEIR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE FIRST TIME OF OBVIOUSLY A INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SHOULD TALK WITH THEIR PARENTS ABOUT THIS A INAS LONG AS THAT A THE PARENTS AND THE CHILD IF ACON OF AGREE AND THE PARENTS ARE ON BOARD WITH THIS AS WELL YOU CAN START GETTING BLOOD WORK A A OFTEN A CHILD WILL COME IN WITH COMPLAINTS OF EITHER PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY OR DELAYED PUBERITY AND THIS INDIVIDUAL MIGHT BE NINE OR THIS INDIVIDUAL MIGHT BE FIFTEEN FOR A HEALTHY CHILD WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH KIND OF THEIR LATER TAINER STAGES WHICH AS FOUR AND FIVE SAVE DEVELOPED SEVERAL SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS THEY MIGHT HAVE A HAIRGROWTH OR A STARTING TO NOTICE A MORE BEARD GROWTH THAT'S A GOOD TIME TO DO IT IF YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH STATURE OR HEIGHTH OR IF YOU'RE NOT TRACKING ALONG WHERE MOST MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY HAVE NOT JUST THERE HEIGHT AND STATURE BUT ALSO THE TIMING OVER THEIR PUBERITY THAN THAT'S TIME TO GET LAPSE T SO IF I COULD TRAVEL BACK IN TIME I WOULD HAVE GOT IN MY BLOOD WORK DONE FOR HORMONES AND LIPIDS AND EVERYTHING ELSE AT EIGHTEEN I UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE AND HOW TO GET THAT AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PRESSING CLINICAL ISSUES AND SO THINK THE FIRST TIME THAT I GOT MY BLOOD WRK DONE I WAS IN MY LATE TWENTIES MAYBE EVEN MY EARLY THIRTIES AND I STILL DYING TO KNOW WHAT MY BLOOD WORK WAS WHEN FOR INSTANCE I WAS SEVENTEEN AND I FELT THE CERTAIN WAY AND I AND I CONFESS THAT IN MANY DIMENSIONS I SHOULD FEEL BETTER NOW AT ILL BE FORTY SEVEN SOON AT FORTY SEVEN THAN I DID IN MY TEENS AN TWENTIES AND I THINK IT WAS MORE ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE I THINK THAT A BUT IN TERMS OF JUST UNDERSTANDING WHY WE FELT GREAT OR WHY WE FELT OR FEEL TERRIBLE OR NOT SO GREAT I THINK A BLOOD WORK IS EXTREMELY IN FORMATIVE WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE KEY THINGS TO LOOK FOR IN BLOOD WORK HOMMANG AVE TESTOSTERONE IS ALWAYS THE TOPIC THAT COMES UP IN THE CONTEXTS OF MAL HORMON OPTIMIZATION BUT CERTAINLY THERE A LOT OF OTHER HORMONES THAT ARE IMPORTANT AS WELL AND WITH TESTOSTRONE YOU WANT TO GET EITHER TESTOSTRONE AN ESS H B G OR A FREE TO STOSTERONE COULD YOU DEFINE ES H B G FOR LISTENERS PLEACE IT IS SEX HORMUM BINDING GLOBULAN IT IS THE PROTNE THAT BINDS UP ALL ANDROGENS AND ESTROGEN OF THE BODY SO THE STRONGER THE ANDROGEN THE STRONGER IT BINDS DEERING PUBERTY STRONG ANDROGENS ESPECIALLY D H T WHICH IS THEE STRONGEST BY IDENTICAL ANDROGEN HAS A HUGE ROLL A PROMINENT ROLL IN SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND IF YOUR S H B G IS VERY HIGH THEN YOUR D H T CAN RUN HIGHER BECAUSE IT'S NOT METABOLIZE BUT THERE'S NOT QUITE AS MUCH FR D H T SO YOU WANT A BALANCE BETWEEN A A HIGH ENOUGH FR D H T AND A HIGH ENOUGH TOTAL T H T AND IVE YU SEE THESE BLOODTESTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE READ AND INTERPRETED BY QUALIFIED PHYSICIAN MUST BE LEARNED GOING TO BE IN A POSICION TO EVALUATE THEM PROPERLY OT LEAST NOT WITH THE FULL DEPTH THAT THEY COULD IF THEY AN EMDY LIKE YOURSELF I'M LOOKING AT THEM O CASE SO EVERYONE SHULD GET BLOOD WORK AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AM DEPENDING ON THEIR BUDGET AND AN AVAILABILITY WHAT SHOULD EVERYBODY DO IN TERMS OF MONOGING THOSE MARKERS SO ASSUMING THAT THERE'S NO MAJOR INTERVENTION HOW OFTEN YOU RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE GET THEIR BLOOD WORK DONE LET'S SAY WIUS TAKE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO JUST TURNED EIGHTEEN THEY JUST GOT THEIR FIRST SET OF BLOOD WORK THEY'LL PROBABLY FIND SOMETHING IN IT THAT THEY MAY WANT TO OPTOMIES USING SHARE DECISION MAKING WITH THEIR PHYSICION USUALLY A GOOD FOLOP IS ABOUT SIX MONTHS ITSO TWICE A YEAR GETTING BLOOD WORK DONE THEN HAVING PHYSICIAN VALUE IT THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME AND FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T INITIATE THIS AT EIGHTEEN SUCH AS MYSELF IT'S THE BEST TIME TO START THEN WOULD BE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I A IN TERMS OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ALL MALE SHOULD DO MEANING ALL MALS OF ALL AGES A PUBERTIN BEYOND I SHOULD DO WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE THINGS SO ON A DAILY BASIS A MAYBE COU JUST TAKE US THROUGH THE ARK OF A DAY AND AM AND PUSH OUT SOME OF THE PROTOCALLS THAT YOU USE OR THE THINGS THAT YOU LIKE TO SEE YOUR MALE PATIENTS USE IN ORDER TO TRY AND OPTIMIZE THERE WERE MONSTATUS I'LL BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME OF THE LIFE STYLE PILLARS TO START DIET AND EXERCISE AR THE FIRST TO A IN PUBERITY SLEEP IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT OF COURSE A BUT WITH DIET AND EXERCISE A THROUGHOUT A LIFE SPAND YOU WANT TO NOT EXCLUDE THINGS THAT ARE HELPING YOU FOR EXAMPLE DEERING PUBERTY IF YOURE CONSUMING DAIRY AND THEN ALL THE SAID YOU CUT OUT ALL DAIRY DARY CAN HELP INCREASE IG O ONE AND FRE IG OF ONE AND WHAND JUST AV WEL GET FOR OUR AUDIENCE MAYBE JUST MENTION WHAT I'D GET WHAT HAVING ENOUGH IG IF ONE CAN DO FOR US THAT'S BENEFICIAL IS IT HELPS YOU GROW IT A HELPS WITH A GENETAL DEVELOPMENT SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND LONG BONE GROWTH A SKIN GROWTH HAIR GROWTH A HOST OF THINGS SO GETTING AN ARRAY OF NUTRIANTS THAT INCLUDE DAIRY WHAT OTHER SORTS OF NUTRIENS ARE IMPORTANT DURING DEVELOPMENT YOU WON'T HAVE ADEQUATE VIDOM AN D VITEMIN D HELPS WITH TUSTOSTERON PRODUCTION T HELPS AGAIN WITH BONE MINERALIZATION AND STATURE A AFTER AN AGE OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE AND THERE'S NOT A STRICT CUT OFF BUT UP TO ABOUT A AGE OF TWENTY FIVE OPOMIZING YOUR GROWTH HORMOT AN IGEOF ONE HELPS WITH BONE DENSITY AND BONE GROWTH SO A FROM THE DIETARY STANDPOINT YOU WOUG TO HAVE ENOUGH FREE ESTRIGEN NOT TOO MUCH WHEN YOU'R GROWING BUT YOU WANT TO HELP A BASICALLY STOCK PILE BONE TO PREVENT A RISK OF OSTEAL PAROCIS OR THIN BONES FRACTURES WHEN YOU'RE OLDER WAS SOME ONE WHO BROKE HIS LEFT FOOT FIVE TIMES WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL I CAN SAN WHATEVER YOUNG PEOPLE CAN DO TO OPTIMIZE THEIR ABONDENSITY WOULD BE GREAT THAT PROMP SEEMS YOU HAVE RESOLVED ITSELF OVER TIME BUT I DON'T KNOW BACK THAN I WAS A I DID A SHORT RUN AS OF EGETARIAN BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN OMINIVORE AM I REALIZE THAT SOME OF THIS RELATES TO EFFECXS AND FOOD ALARGIES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT WOULD YOU SAY THAT ON BALANCE THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM EATING A COMMINATION OF YOU QUALITY PROTINES FROM ANIMAL SOURCES AND NON ANIMAL SOURCES FRUITS VEGETABLES AND STARCHIS I'M EAN WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR INSTANCE ABOUT PEOPLE FALLING IV PURE CARNIVORE OR A VERY A PURE VIGAN DIET IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES IN THERE LATE TWENTIES AN MIGHT BE I REASONABLE OPTION IN EARLY TWENTIES AND CERTAINLY TEENS IT IS A HORRIBLE IDEA BECAUSE IT IS LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE YOUR FREE INTRIGENCE SO YOU WILL HAVE LESS TOSTOSTRON ACTING ON RECEPTURES THROUGH THE BODY ARE THERE ANY OTHER MICRO NUTRIENS OR MACCRNUTRIENTS THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTY SHOULD EMPHASIZE WE HAVE' NEALLY TACHED ON FATTY ACIDS OR FIBRE TOO MUCH A FIBRE IS GOING TO BE PARAMOUNT IN KIND OF LIKE SETTING YOUR SET PWEINT OF YOUR GOT MICRO BIUM THE REST OF YOUR LIFE THERE IS PREBIOTIC FIBRE WHICH YOU CAN THINK OF AS FISH FOOD FOR YOUR GOOD GOT MICROBIUM YOUR GOT MICROBIUM'S CUNA LIKEAN ACQUATERYN OR FISHTANK NOMOUSLYN BY GOLDFISH SWIMMING ROUND IN THAT THEGOLDFISH EATING PEOPLE DONTIN GOLDFISH PEOPLE HELP YU LAN WERE DED TE A BUT ANY FIBRE OR FOOD THAT YOUR PUTTING IN YOUR GUT IT'S EITHER GOING TO IT'S GOING TO SCEDE YOUR GOT MICRO BIUM TOWARD SOMETHING THAT IS MORE BENEFICIAL OR OR MORE DETRIMENTAL AND IT WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE PREBITIC FIBR AND THE GETTING ESSENTIAL FATY ACIDS A THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO DO THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPANNAR JUST FOR PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE TEEN AGE TWENTYES THIRTIES BECAUSE AT HELPS WITH BRAIN DEVELOPMENT A YOU'RE CERTAINLY MORE OF AN EXPERT THAN ME WHEN IT COMES TO AM BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BUT IT DOES CONTINUE TO TODEVELOP THROGREALLY THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN BUT CERTAINLY THROUGH THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES AS WELL ABOUT EM TAKING A MULTIVEITEMEN WAY YOUR GROWING UP SO MANY PEOPLE IM DO THAT IS IT NECESSARY IS I USEFUL AND IF IT'S NOT NECESSARY IS IT SAFE TO DO ANYWAY IT'S GENERALLY SAFE TO DO ANYWAY A I DO NOT THINK EVERYBODY NEEDS A MULTIVITOMIN THE MORE EXCLUSIONARY YOUR DIET IS FR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A SEELIACTISEASE OR IF YOUR PLAIN ON FERTILITIE SOON THEN PERHAPS IT'S MORE REASONABLE TO TAKE A MULTIVITOMIM IN A PREVIOUS DISCUSSION OF OURS I ASKED YOU ABOUT AM COLORIC RESTRICTION AND TESTOSTRONE AND IF I RECALL CORRECTLY THE IDEA WAS THAT IF SOMEBODY IS OVER WEIGHT THEY HAVE EXCESS FAT ATIPOST TISSUE THEN GETTING RID OF SOME OF THAT ATIPOST TISSUE BY THROUGH COLORIC RESTRICTION AND EXERCISE PROVIDEDS DONE NOT TOO FAST AND HEALTHY WAY IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR TESTOSTRONE IN THE LONG RUN BUT THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT CARRYING AN EXCESS OF BODY FAT COLORIC RESTRICTION IS ACTUALLY GOING TO LOWER TEST OSTRON FORSTVALL DO I HAVE THAT CORRECT AND SECOND ARE THER ANY A A DENDEMS TO THAT THAT YOU'D LIKE TO TO GIVE US NOW THAT'S CORRECT A IF YOU LOOK AT AN INDIVIDUAL IN A COLORIC DEFIS AT SEVERAL CHANGES WILL HAPPEN ONE IS THAT THEY'LL HAVE LESS BUILDING BLOCKS FOR HORMONES ANOTHER IS THAT THEY WILL BE IN A CATABOLIC STATE MORE OFTENS THAT BALANCE OF AN ABOLISM AND CATCATABOLISM WILL BE DIFFERENT THEY'LL LIKELY HAVE LESS SIGNALING FRO GROWTH HORMONAN IG F ONE AND THEYLL ALSO HAVE THE HIGH ES H B G THAT WE DEFIND EARLIER AS THE BINDING PROTINE SO THEYR FREE ANDRIGENS AND FREE ESTROGENS WILL GO DOWN BECAUSE WE TOUCHED ON SLEEP BEING CRITICAL I WOULD TAKE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN TRYIND GET ENOUGH QUALITY SLEEP AT LEAST EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE NIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE AND THE OTHER TWENTY PERCENT NURGEST WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S NOISE OUTSIDE OR YOUR STRAS A JUST YOU HAVE AN EXAMOR YOU HAVEN'T A GREAT TIME FOR WHATEVER REASON OL HOW TO GOOD GOOD REASONS TO LOSE SOME SLEEP NOW AND AGAIN AS WELL BUT O BE HAVE SLEEP WE'VE GOT A NUTRITION E TOUCHED ON THAT I WILL GET BACK INTO SUPPLEMENTATION WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER PILLARS OF CREATING IT THE PROPER ENVIRONMENT FOR HORMONOPTIMIZATION A STRESS IS PROBABLY NEXT ONE A DEARING ABOTH PUBRITY BUT ALSO THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES INDIVIDUALS ARE FIGURING OUT HOW THEY WANT TO COPE WITH STRESS AND ALSO FIGURING OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO CHOOSE TO PUT THEIR EFFORT INTO SO IF SOME ONE IS OVER STRESS THAN IT CAN HAVE A ITCAN PUT ALL THE OTHER LIFESTYLE PILLARS AND THEN THEY STOP DIETING WELL  THEY STOP EXERCISING AND EVERYTHING ELSE CAN GO ASKCUE A THERE IS ALSO SOME DEGREE OF A SOCIAL COMPONENT TO THIS SO PERHAPS THAN YOU TO ADD A SEVENTH PILLAR OF SOCIAL A A YOU KNOW DEARING YOUR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES YOU MAY FORMING O FAMILY AS WELL PERHAPS YOU HAVE CHILDREN AND THE HEALTH OF THE FAMILY UNIT IS GOING TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT A NOT ONLY NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY FOR HORMONOPTIMISATION BUT IT'S GON TA THROW EVERYTHING ELSE OFF OF IS OFF AND FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AHA STARTING THEIR OWN FAMILIES IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES GIN TAT SOCIAL CONNECTION AM THE EXTENT TID TO FRIENDSHIPS AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL ABSOLUTELY IN FACTS IF SOME ONE'S NOT STARTING TO FAMILY IT IT IS JUSTICE CONCERNING BUT FOR OTHER REASONS EACH INDIVIDUALS CAN HAVE THEIR CLOSE GROUP OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND IF SOME ONE DOES NOT HAVE ONE OF THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT'S WHEN THINGS CAN POTENTIALLY A GET BAD NOT JUST FOR THEM INDIVIDUALLY BUT ALSO SOCIETY SO WEN YOU SAY STRESS YOU MEAN LEARN TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS A WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE I'MING WIN A VOPATION AM YOU KNOW A'S HIGH BLOOD PRESSUR EVEN IF THEY DON'T AM YOU JUST SENSE AT THEIR STRESS THEYV LOT OF PRESSURED SPEECH OR THEY'RE NOT FEELING WELL OR COMMUNICATING THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL A WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU RECOMMEND IN ORDER TO TRY AND AMELIATE THAT STRESS THERE'S DIFFERENT MINDFULNESS OR RELAXATION TECHNIQUES GOING OUTSIDE CAN OFTON HELP WITH US AS WELL A IT' DIETARY CHANGES AN EXERCISE CAN HELP WITH US TO SOME PEOPLE LIKE PRAYER OR MEDITATION AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE A COUNCELLING OR THERAPY OR EVEN JUST TALKING A OPENLY WITH A FAILING UMBER OR A FRIEND WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE OTHER PILLARS FOR HORMON OPTIMISATION HERE I FEEL LIKE WERE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN THEIR TWHENIES AND THIRTIES BUT AGAIN WERE ANWRAPPING OUR ARMS AROUND THEY SECLY PUBERTY ONWARD I MEAN I'D I'M IN GOSHI LOOKING BACK I I'S STARD MEDITATING PRETTY EARLY ASTARED WAY TRAINING AND RUNNING EARLY AT GAVE SOME THOUGHT TO MY DIED AND HIGH SCHOOL BUT REALLY WAS IN COLLEGE TIS ARE THINKING MORE ABOUT WHAT I WAS IN JESTING AND WINE ND TRYING TO DO BETTER THERE BUT PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THE TABLE AT DIFFERENT STAGES AOF A LIFE AND TRYING TO OPTIMIZE FOR HORMONES A YOU KNOW SO WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD DO IT WON'T YOU GET OUTSIDE AND FIND A A MOVEMENT PASTTIME TO LAST A LIFETIME YOUE EIN TO GET SUNLIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME DEGREE OF HEAT AND COLD EXPOSURE AND YOU'RE ALSO JUST CAN I MOVE MORE A BEING AN ARTIFICIAL ENFIRONMENT WHER THERE'S ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS ARTIFICIAL ER CONDITIONING A IS A GOING TO HAVE MANY EFFECTS ON YOUR BODY A SO THAT'S FITAL ANOTHER ONE IS FINDING WHAT YOUR PURPOSE IS IN LIFE SO I CALL THIS SPIRIT BUT IT'S RELY JUST A SELF ACTUALIZATION COMPON IT OF MASLOW'S HIGHERARCHY IF NEEDS HERE'S PASICALLY YOUR PHYSICAL NEEDS YOU'R MENTAL NEEDS AND THEN YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE WHAT YOU REALLY LIKE TO DO  PICKING SOME GOAL OR TARGET I WAYS SAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO STICK TO THE SAME GOAL OVER TIMES CERTAINLY I HAVEN'T ALTHOUGH I GOT STARTED EARLY IN THE SCIENCE GAME AND HIM STILL IN IT A THE IDEA IS NOT TO PICK THE EN GOAL IT'S TO PICK A GOAL AND THEN ONCE YOU REACH THAT GOAL TO ASSASSIN THEN PICK ANOTHER GOAL AND SO ON ITHINK SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE HERE ABOUT PICKING A PURPOSE LIKE GOING IN ERS I HAVE TO DEFIND SORT LIKE NAMING ONESELF A Y YOU YASHIKAN CHANGE YOUR YOU'RE YOU'RE GOALS IN PURPOSE OVER TIME THIS IS TERRIFIC WOULD YOU A SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE ACTIVELY USE OR AVOID SUPPLEMENTATION A PRIOR TO DOING ALL THESE OTHER THINGS I'M SOMEBODY LIKES TO THROW THE KITCHEN SINK ET THINGS BUT ELSE LIKE TO DO THINGS PRETTY SYSTEMATICALLY SO I WAS A BEHAVIOUR'S FIRST THEN NUTRICIAN THEN SUPPLEMENTATIEN AND THEN MAYBE AND IF IN ONLY IF THERE'S A REAL NEED OF COURSE WORKING WITH THE DOCTOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE PROBABLY PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES OR THIRTIES MAY BEN IN THEIR FIFTIES THET AREN'T FEELING GREAT AND THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN MORE AND OR TO IM FEEL MORE CONFIDENT TO SEEK OUT SOCIAL CONNECTION THEY TRIN GO GO ABOUT THE WHOLE ON BUSINESS FROM THE OTHER FROM TE OTHER SIDE AS WELL BUT WHAT R YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT I SEE SUPPLEMENTS AND MEDICATIONS AS VERY SIMILAR ONE PRESCRIBED AN ONE'S NOT IN GENERAL MEDICATIONS HAVE MORE SIDE EFFECTS OR POTENTIALLY STRONGER THERPUTIC WITH MORE EFFICACY BUT THEYARE JUST TOOLS TO REACH AN IND GOAL SO DEPINION ON THE GOAL IF THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL IT'S AN ATHLETE THEN CERTAINLY THEY SHOULD CONSIDER SUPPLEMENTATION OR OF SOME ONE A DESIRES OPTIMAL OR VERY A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF COGNATIVE PERFORMANCE THEY SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER SUPPLEMENTATION AT THE SAME TIME FOOD IS MEDICINE AND A LOT OF BENEFITS YOU CAN GET IN SUPPLEMENTS YOU CAN GET IN FOOD AS WELL IS IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH TIME AND ENERGY YOU'E GOING TO SPEND IN ALSO FINANCES I KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I COULD AFFORD JUST A FEW SUPPLEMENTS AND THEIRE BASILY WAY PROTENE AND OM FISHOILE I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I WAS POINTING THE DIRECTION OF THOSE THINGS AND SOME CREATINE I COULDN'T AFFORD MUCH ELSE I OVERTIME OF COURSE I COULD AFFORD MORE BUT AM IT REALLY DOES OFTEN DEPEND ON ON FINANCES BEFORE WE GET IN O SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO OPTIMIZE TO STOSTERON ESTEROGEN THIROY GROTHORMON ET CETERA WHEN I SEE YOR QUESTION I'V BEEN WONDRING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME YOU SO OFTEN IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT MALE HORMON OPTIMIZATION PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU KNOW IF YOUR LIBITO IS SUFFERING YE YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT TESTOSTERONE OR EVEN ESTRGEN I AUS WE KNOW THAT ESTEROGEN CAN IMPACT LOBITO AS WELL SOMETIMES HAVING ESTEROGEN TOO LOW IS DETRIMENTAL FOR LIBITO OR THE PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE NOT RECOVERING FROM WORK OUTS ARE YOU JUST YOUR FEELING KIND OF DEPRESSED THE PROBLEM IS IT'S ALL SUBJECTIVE SO HOW DOES ONE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE RECOVERY FROM WORK EUT THEI'RE ENERGY THEIRE CONFIDENCE THEI'RE LIBIDO IS WITHIN A HEALTHY RANGE I MAY OBVIOUSY FOR PEOPLE IN THE RELATIONSHIP THEY CAN KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEI'RE LABIDO MATCHES THE SORT OF CADENCE OF OF THE RELATIONSHIP IN THEIR PARTNER BUT HOW SHOULD PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS AMAVIAN START TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES I THINK BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES IS THAT BECAUSE FEMALES HAVE A MONTHLY PSYCHL THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN THEIR HARMONS OVER TIME BECAUSE EVERY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THOSE FOREMENTS OR CHANGING DRAMATICALLY IN WAYS IMPACT THEIR PHYSIOLOGY AN PSYCHOLOGY BUT FROR MALES I FEEL LIKE THEIR SORT OF A A A A DIRTH OF LANGUAGE TO GET INTO THE MORE SUBTLE ASPECTS OF THIS E'LSE HASE TO DO WITH PRIVACY ISSUES AN PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY DO'T WANT OVERSHARE I'M TOO MUCH NOT KNOWING WHAT'S APPROPRIATE TO SHARE BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO A PATIENT WHO'S IN THEIR THIRTIES MAY BEEN THEIR SEVENTIES OR SIXTIES DOESN'T MATTER A MALE PATIEN WHAT AR YOU LISTENING FOR AND A YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A PSYCHITRISS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR EARS TUNE TO IN ORDER TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER OT THIS PERSON COULD REALLY USE SOME HELP WITH ORMON OPNIMIZATION OR WHETHER NOT SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE THEY'RE JUST DOING GREAT ANDTHEY DON'T REALIZE IT BECAUSE THEY'RE PLACING DEMANDS ON THEMSELVES THAT ARE EXCESSIVE OU WENY YOU WANT TO USE A LOT OF OPEN IN QUESTIONS THIS PROCESS IS CALLED MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING AND YOUR GOAL IS TO LISTEN TO THE PATIENT AND NOT PLAANT AN IDEA IN THEIR MIND THAT THEY CAN FOLLOW BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT GOAL A SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT READING THEIR BIO FEET BACK OR A TELLING HOW THEY FEEL ON A DAILY BASIS THERE IS SCREENING QUESTIONAIRS DESIGN FOR EXAMPLE AN ADAM QUESTIONAIR TO LOOK AT MENCE A MINCE HEALTH AND HORMON RELATED HEALTH IT'S GOLE AN ADAM QUESTION ADAM QUESTIONA D A M CORRECT IS IT AVAILABLE N LINE THAT PEOPLE COULD BE ADMINISTER TO THEMSELVES ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE MAKING CLINICAL DIAGNOSES OF THEMSELVES OR ANY ONE ELSE IS IT THAT SORT OF EXAM IT IS INTERESTING I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS A CLINICALLY VALIDATED TOOL LIKE AN A  C V D WHICH IS LIKE A A RISK OF HART ATTACK AND STROKE TOOL OR MANY OTHER TOOLS A THERE'S ONE FOR TO QUESTION THERE'S ONE FOR ANXIETY THEY'RE CALLED P H K NINE AND GAT SEVEN RESPECTIVELY BUT ANYWAY THERE'S OFTEN AN INTH ADAM QUESTIONAIR AND WHAT YOU HEAR FROM THE PATIENT IF YOU WERE VERY CAREFUL LISTENER IS OFTEN DIFFERENT CANYOU GIVE MEAN EXAMPLES ON THE QUESTIONS ON THIS ADAM QUESTION AIR OR THE SORTS OF MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING TAT YOU MIGHT DO SONCE IY AM YOU'R PATIENT WE SIT DOWN WHAT SORTS OF QUESTIONS WOULD BE ASK TO PROBE THESE KINDS OF DIMENSIONS OF A ORMONTS QUESTIONS ABOUT LABIDO QUESTIONS ABOUT ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE QUESTIONS ABOUT MOTIVATION AND OFTEN THE PATIENT WILL ANSWER ONE THING BUT WHAT YOU HEAR FROM THEM SUBJECTIVELY IS FAR DIFFERENT INTIENT CAN YOU MEAN EXAMPLE OF OF A QUESTION IM HAI'M HAPPY TO BE THE THE GINEA PIG AR A CLASSIC ONE IS A GUY COMES IN AND I A LOT OF TIMES THEY SAY I KNOW THE WIFE MADE ME GO TO THE DOCTOR I GO A ONCE YEAR THAT'S IT I DON'T WANT ANYTHING I DON'T ANY MEDICATIONS THERE SCREENING QUESTIONIRS MIGHT BE ZEROS ACROSS THE PORD SO NOTHING NO ISSUES THEY'R PPARENTLY IN PERFECT HEALTH THEY TALK TO YOU FOR A WHILE THEY GET SOME REPOR THEY LIKE YOU AND THEN RIGHT IS YOUR FINISHMRN THE VISIT AND ABOUT TO GO OUT THE ROOM THEY MENTION THAT A THEIR LIBIDO ISN'T QUITE THERE AND THEIRE HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF E D IAS WELL AND PERHAPS OR EVEN HAVING SOME CHESS PRESSURE TIGHTNESS I SEE SO RIGHT AS YOU'RE LEAVING THE ROOM A PATIENT WILL TELL YOU THAT THEYRE HAVING SOME SEXUAL SIDE OF FACTS OR I'E NOT SIDIFICE TO HAVING SOME SEXUAL CHALLENGES AND THEN THEY'LL MENTION CHESS PRESSURE IS THE CHESS QUESSURE A SORT OF GENERAL DECOY OR TIT'S GOT A BE MY HEART OR IS IT AWAS IT RELATED TO THE OTHER THINGS THEY'RE REPORTEDG IT CAN BE RELATED IN FACT A ERECTILE DIS FUNCTION IS NOTICE THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE SO COAL MINERS WOULD TAKE THE CANARY DOWN AND IT WOULD A THE CANARY WOULD DIE BEFORE THE COAL MINERS WOULD I BELIEVE CARBOMONOXIDE POISONING AND OFTEN A ONE OF THE CAUSES OF ED IS PLACK BUILD UP WHICH CAN HAPPEN IN THE CORONERIES AS WELL BUT SOMETIMES THEY NOTICE THE SYMPTOM AND THE GENITILS BEFORE THEY DO IN THE CORNERS SO FOR SUCH A PATIENT A LET SAY THAT PATIENT WAS A YOUNG PERSON WHERE BLACK BUILD UP IN THE ARTERIES AND BAINS IS NOT ALL THAT LIKELY IF THERE BULD SAY IN THEIR TWENTIES OR THIRTIES A WHAT WOULD BE YOUR NEXT STEP OF THE INTERVIEW AT THAT POINT AND WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER WOULD YOU IMMEDIATELY ORDER LABS FOR THAT PERSON TO TRY AND RULE OUT ANY KIND OF AM AACTUAL HORMONE LEVEL DEFICIENCY I CERTAINLY WOULD ORDER LABS THERE'S SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR AND THEY COMINE IN THEY HAVE THE SAME SYMPTOMS AND ONE INDIVIDUAL MIGHT HAVE A VERY VERY HIGH TESTOSTEROM AND ONE INDIVIDUAL MIGHT BE A SEVERELY HYPOGEN ATLE SO THERS O A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SUBJECTIVE AND WHAT THE LABS LOOK LIKE SO I CERTAINLY ORDER LABS YOU ALSO ASK THEM ABOUT A IF IT'S SITUATIONAL LOT UR NOT YOU ASK THEM IF THEY HAVE EDY IF THERE A YOU KNOW THE ASKS ABOUT THEIR HABITS YOUVE EN ASK ABOUT A PORN AND MASTURBATION AND ALL THESE ISSUES AND OF COURSE THAT'S BETWEEN THE DOCTOR AND THE PATIENT AND DEPINION ON WHAT THEY TELL YOU YOU CAN OFTEN DETERMINE IF THERE IS A SITUATIONAL COMPONENT SOME PEOPLE CALL IT'S PSYCHOGENIC E D BUT I DON'T LOVE THE TERM PSYCHOGENIC E D BECAUSE IT KIND OF PUT SOME SOME BLAME ON THE PATIENTS A MIND BUT A LOT OF THE TIME THAT IS THE CASE THERE IS EVEN A TEST AAND THIS IS VERY RARELY ORDERED WHAT IT'S CALLED A NOCTURNAL PENILE TO MESSONS I BECIS IS IT TRUE THAT THERE ARE PERIODIC ERECTIONS DURING SLEEP GRTS YE SO A YOU BASICALLY PUT A CUF TO SEE IF YOU ARE HAVING A A A NORMAL SIZED IRECTION DURING SLEEP AND I BELIEVE ABOUT NINETY PERSEN OF THE TIME THEY DO THAT TEST A THEY ARE INDEED HAVING ERECTIONS WHICH WOULD POINT TO THIS PSYCHOGENIC ORIGIN OF WHATEVER CHALLENGES THEIR HAVING IN TERMS OF SEXUAL INTERACTIONS YOU MENTION PORN AND MASTURBATION A THIS TOPIC HAS COME UP A BUNCH OF TIMES ON THIS POTCAST AND ON OTHER POTCAS I'VE GONE ON BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOPOMENE A SEXUAL MOTIVATION AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND I'VE BEEN OF THE PRETTY STRONG STANCE THAT WELL I'M NOT JUDGING PORNER MASTURBATION IT CAN CREATE A BRAIN WIRING SITUATION WHERE MALES IN PARTICULAR SENTIALY TEACH THE BRAIN TO BE AROUSED BY WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE HAV SAC HAS SUPPOSED TO BEING THE FIRST PERSON ACTOR IN SEXUAL A ENTERACTIONS SO IN THAT SENSE AM YOU KOW THAT'S MORE ABOUT THE BRAIN WIRING AND NERL PLASTICITY AND DOPOMENE BUT WHATARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON PORN AND MASTURBATION AS THEY REALLY TO HORMONS AMAN THIS IS A BIG DEBATE ON THE INNER ANDNAT AND FAC M THE MOST A COMMON DEBATES IS WEATHER OR NOT MASTURBATION INCREASES OR DECREASES TO STOSTERON AND MALS CERTAINLY IT WILL DECREASE MOTIVATION TO GO FINE SEXUAL PARTNERS WE KNOW THIS  AND THERE MORNMORE DATE ON THIS ALL THE TI I'M IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHY IN MASTURBATION AND HERE I SUPPOSE WE NEED TO BE A SOMEWHAT SPECIFIC AND OPERATIONALLY TEFIND WHATE WER TALK ABOUT WERE TALKING ABOUT PORN IN MASTURBATION TO THE POINT OF EJACULATION RIGHT AM BECAUSE MINORSTANDING IS THAT THE EJACULATION IN AN ORGASM ASSOCIATE WITH IT CAUSING INCREASE IN PROLACTIN WHICH BLUNTS LEBIDO FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THE DURATION OF THAT WILL VARY FROM PERSONAL PERSON IN CIRCUMSTANCE O CIRCUMSTANCE BUT BASILY ALL THIS POINTS OF THE FACT THAT PORN IN MASTURBATION CAN REALLY LIMIT LABIDO IN THE REAL WORLD AND TO ME A PORNOGRAPHY AND THE SCREEN IS NOT THE REAL WORLD OF SCREENS EXIST IN TH REAL WORLD THE REAL WORLD DOESN'T EXIST IN THE SCREEN THAT'S AN ACCURATE STATEMENT AND PROLACTIN DOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ACUTE INCREASE AFTER A EJACULATION IT DOES TO SOME DEGREE AFTER ORGAASM AS WELL BUT PROLACTIAN ACTS ON THE POTUITARY TO INHIBIT THE RELEASE OF THE HORMONS ELATIENT EFFASATE OF WHICH ELAGH CAN INCREASE TO STOSTERONE SO THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE CASES WOREH THE DOSE MAKES THE POISON AND IF IT IS A VERY FREQUENT HABIT CERTAINLY A DAILYOR MORE THAN ONCE A DAY WOULD BEVERY DETRIMENTAL FROM A HORMONAL COMPONENT NOT EVEN TAKING TO ACCOUNT THE THE NURL WIRING THE SAT I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC THE VASHE DEFINE FREQUENCY BECAUSE THIS IS THE PROBLEM ON THE INNER NET OR EVEN IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE YOU'LL SEE AM DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT PORNOGRAPHY BEING DANGEROUS FOR CERTAIN THINGS OR OR DETRIMENTAL TO HORMOS BE'LL TAKE FREQUENT BUT WHAT'S FREQUENT SO YOU'RE SAYING DAILY OR MULTIPLE TIMES PERDAY WOULD BE PETENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE HORNMONE PROFILE OF A MALE OF ESSENTIALLY ANY AGE AND THAT'S JUST FOR MASTURBATION A WITH PANOGRAPHY A WITH PORN USE AS WELL IT WOULD LIKELY BE WORSE WHY WHY IS THAT JUST AS THIS THE SORT OF DOPEMEN URGIC DRIVE OF THE STIMULUS JUST A REALLY THEINTENSE VISUAL STIMULUS DUPAMING SENSITIVITY A I THINK THAT A USING THE ANALOGY OF A DUPAMING WAVE POOL IT WOULD DEEPEN THE POOL BUT NOT INCREASE YOUR SUPPLY OF DUPEMIN MAYBE YOU DESCRIBE THE DOPEMING WAVE BECAUSE I THINK IT' SUCH A POWERFUL WAY OF THINKING ABOUT DOPAMING IN WHAT DOPAMING DOES IN FACT I'VE EM ALWAYS CREDITED YOU IN WHEN I'VE DONE IT BUT I'VE AVE GENERALLY A STOLEN YOUR ANALOGY OF THE DOPAMING WAVE WOILL BECAUSE IT IT'S SO ASTUTE THE DUPEMING WAVE POOL DESCRIBES THE NATURAL VARIATION OF UPS AND DOWNS IN YOUR DOPAMIN OR YOUR MODE OFATION AND A IN THE WAVE POOL DEPINING ON HOW HIGH THE PEAK IS YOU OFTEN HAVE A DEEPER TROUGH SO YOU DO NOT WANT TO HI OF AT PIQUE IN ADDITION IF YOUR PEAKUE IS VERY VERY HIGH FOR EXAMPLE A WHEN YOU'RE USING A MINY SUBSTANCES LIKE A COCANE OR LIKE IMPHETAMENS YOUR DUPMING CAN GO SO HIGH YOUL LOSE ALMOST ALL THE WATER FROM THE WAVEPOOL AND IN WHEN YOU CRASH FROM THAT NOT ONLY IS THE TROUG FLOW YOU HAVE LESS DUPIMEN IN THE POOL TO BEGIN WITH THE DUPAMEAN RECEPTOR IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE AS IS THE GABA RECEPTOR WHICH IS AN INHIBITORY RECEPTOR WHEREAS DUPIMEN AS TEPHNICALLY A STIMULANT MORE RELATED TO A DRINALAN ANORDRENDALIN THE DEPTH OF THE POOL CAN CHANGE VERY QUICK SO YOU WONT TO HAVE THAT HAPPY MEDIUM WHERE YOU'RE FAIRLY NEAR THE TOP BUT YOU'RE NOT SO NEAR THE TOP THAT THE DEPTH OF THE POOLS GEN TO GO DOWN SO IF I INTERPRET ON THAT IN THE CONTEXTS OF THES DISCUSSION ABOUT UM LEBIDO SEX PORNER MASTERBATION IT IF SOMEBODY HAS A VERY INTENSE SEXUAL EXPERIENCE AND NOT NOT YOUE WERE NOT A SERLY TIME OUT INTENSE UM ORGASM WERE TALKING ABOUT JUST IN YOU A LOT OF INTENSE VISUAL SO VERY AM A LOT OF INTENSE IMAGERY YOUR AUDITORY EMPOITER BOTH THAT IS GOING TO LEAD TO A SITUATION WHERE DOPOMY IS GOING TO BE DEPLETED AFTERWARDS CORRECT A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST A BEFORE MY COLLEGATE STAMPOR DOCTOR ON OLEMPKIS EXPERN ADDITION TALKED ABIT ABOUT THIS THE SORT OF SEA SAWING I YOU ERE TING ABOUT A WAVE AND A CRASHING OUT OF THE WATER FROM THE WAVEPOOL THERE WAS A SEA SAWING FROM PLEASURE IN PAIN I'S GOING TO BE A LONGER AND DEEPER PERIOD OF LACK OF PLEASURE FOLLOWING THAT ND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THING OH WELL THAT'S GREATIN ON THEY WANT THE INTENSE EXPERIENCE BUT IF THAT INTENSE EXPERIENCEIS COMING FROM PORNOGRAPHY IND MASTERBATION OR I SPPOS COMING FROM YOU HIDRENNALAN ACTIVITIES LIKE YU KNOW LIFE A LIFE RISKING PARCOR HANGING OFF THE SIDE OF A BUILDING IT INEVITABLY IS GOING TO LEAD TO DEPRESSIVE EPISODES LOLABITO EPISODES THAT FOLLOW IS THAT RIGHT CORRECT IN A SIMILAR PHYSIOLOGIC WAY A TO WITHDRAWAL FROM STIMULANTS LIKE AMPHEDAMINES NOW IS SEX WITH A PARTNER DIFFERENT BHECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE CHASING MORE AND MORE INTENSE EXPERIENCES WITH A PARTNER AS OPPOSED TO THROUGH PORNOGRAPHY AND MASTERBATION AND GAN HERE WORE TIE ABOUT ALL AGES AND I SHOULD ALWAYS SAY ANY TIME WE'RE TALK OU ABOUT SEX WITH A PARTNER WERE TALKING I YOTHE THE FOUR CONDITIONS THAT I WAS UM LAY OUT ON THE A HOU WRIN NOT PODCASARD THAT RE TIKING OT CONSENSUAL AGE APPROPRIATE CONTEXT APPROPRIATE SPECIES APPROPRIATE INTERACTIONS E AND A THIS IS ALSO A CASE WHERE THE DUSE MAKES THE POISON SO IF THERE'S A YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY MEAN ALL THOSE CRITERIA IF THEY HAVE ONE PREFERENCE A THAT FOR BOTH OF THEM IS A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE THEN THAT IS LIKELY O  YOU'RE NOT GOINGTO BEABLE TO MAINTAIN DUPIMINE OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SO THERE VERY WELL MAY BE A CRASH FROM THAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL AND THE CRASH MAY BE DIFFERENT IN ONE PARTNER OF IN THE OTHER INTERESTING AL DOHN ANALOGY TO FOOD O VILIC YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO SERVE THE BANQUET MEAL SEVERN SEVEN NIGHTS OF THE WEEK MAY BE JUST TOO IS THAT RIGHT AND THERE ARE OTHER DELICIOUS FOODS OUT THERE AND YES  USE THAT AN ALEGET IS VERY REASONABLE I CAN NOT TRYN TO BE P G THIRTEEN JUST TRYING TO A I MPARSIMONY OCHAM'S RAZOR THE ABILITY TO DESCRIBE A LOT OF THINGS IN IN IN A FEW WORDS I'D LIKE TO RETURN TO THE KEY THINGS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO OR I SHOULD SAY THE KEY THINGS THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO OPTIMIZED THEIR HARMONS WE TALK ABOUT GETTING SOME MOVEMENT GETTING SOME SUNLIGHT GETTING QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION ONE WAY O THE OTHER AVOID EXCESSIVELY FREQUENT MASTURBATION AND VOU IN PORNOGRAPHY AND FOR SOME PEOPLE ZERO MIGHT BE THE OPTIMAL NUMBER AND I TO COMING BACK FOR THOSET PEOPLE FOR MOST PEOPLE INTERESTING I FEEL SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE GROWN UP PRIOR TO THE AVAILABILITY OF INTERNET PONOGRAPHY I'VE NEVER BEEN A CONSUMER PORNIGRAPHY AT JUST NOT BEEN MY THING IT BUT I HEAR SO OFTEN FROM MAILS OF ALL AGES ABOUT THEIR DICTION TO IT THERE AFFLICTION BY IT IT'S REALLY A SERIOUS ISSUE AND THAT'S ON O THE REASONS WH I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND YOUR CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THESE PATIENTS I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ITHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITAMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL F YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SO AM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASN I STARTY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ORE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH IR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITES POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS IN ATHLTIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ITHLETI GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE GRIGHT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S THATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY A VITEM IND THREE K TO TERMS OF EXERCISE YOUKNOW HEAR'S IT AGAIN IT'S A DOUBLE EDGE SORD UM ON THE ONE AND IT'S GREAT TO GET EXERCISE BUT I'V FAMILIAR WITH YOU KN IF I TRAIN AN HOUR A DAY YOUR TEN MINUTES OF WARM UP IN FIFTEN MINUTES TO AN HOUR OF WAIT TRAINING OR FIFTY MINUTES TO AN HOUR OF CARDIO I FEEL GREAT SPECIALYIF A ONCE A WEEK I TAKE A COMPLETE DAY OFF THA SORT OF MY GENERAL SCADUAL I'M ALSO FAMILIAR WITH WHEN I GO OUT FOR RUNS THAT ARE EXCESSIVELY LONG TWO HOUR RUNS OR I'V SPEND NINETY MINUTES IN THE GIM TOO FREQUENTLY SER TO FEEL LIKE GARBIT EVERYTHING SUFFERS MY SLEEP STARTS TO SUFFERER DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH I YE I DON'T SEEM TO RECOVERER I DON'T FEEL WELL SO I REALIZE THAT RECOVERY ABILITY VARIES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BUT WHAT YOU THINK IS A HEALTHY SUSTAINABLE EXERCISE REGIMEN THAT ANY ONE CAN FOLLOW THAT WILL ALSO SUPPORT THEIR HORMON STATUS FOR REALLY VIGOROUS EXERCISE AROUND THREE TO FOUR TIMES A WEEK IS VERY SUSTAINABLE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME ON TOP OF THAT YOU COULD ADD IN THREE OR FOR MORE INSTANCEIS OF LESS VIGOROUS EXERCISE O CASO FOR LESS VIERIUS WE DOU MEAN YOUSZOWN TWO CARDIO WHERE YOU CAN HOLD A CONVERSATION BUT BEYOND WHICH YOU YOU CAN'T AND FOR MORE VIGOROUS YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING WAIHT TRAINING OR HIT A HIGHINTENSITY INTERAL TYPE TRAIN IS ICORRECT A YOU CAN ALSO WAIT TRAIN AND HAVE SOME BENEFIT EVEN AT A LOW TO MODERATE INTENSITY IF YOU THINK ABOUT A WEIT TRAINING WHERE YOU HAVE AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TY TO THE INCIDENTS OF DOMS WHICH IS DELAYED ON SET MUSCLE SORESS BUT IF YOU WAIT TRAIN LAZY OR EASY FROM TIME TO TIME I'VE A SEE ONE AWAIT TRINED VERY HEAVY FROM TIME TO TIME AS WELL BECAUSE OF A MORE LEAN BODY MASS GROTH BUT A IF YOU WAIT TRAIN THE LIGHTER YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT MORE OFTEN AND IT CAN STILL HELP WITH THE HYPERTROPHE OF A COLLEGE AND FOR EXAMPLE INTENDENTS IN LICAMOUS SO HERE AGAIN AM BUT TO A PERHAPS DRILL INTO THIS NOTION OF INTENSITY AND LIGHT WAIHTS BECAUSE FOR ME SOME OF THE MOST BRUTAL WORK OUTS OF EVERDONE WERE IN WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A HIGH REPETITION RANGE FIFTEEN TO FIFTY I SHE I WENT UP TO OR AGAIN TO WATCHIE INTRNATIONAL TRACK AND FEEL CHAMPIONSHIPS WE WENT BID IT AM CAMERON HAINSES PLACE I THE CAMERON HANDS AND HE AN HIS TRAINER PUT A THROUGH A WORK OUT THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY REPETITIONS PERSET AND IT WAS DONE IN CIRCUIT AND IT WAS BRUTAL SO IT WAS LIGHT I'M THAT'S THOSE WEIHTS WERE NOTHING IN SOME CASES IT AS BODY WEIGHT BUT THE NUMBER REPETITIONS WAS BRUTAL SO WHEN YOU SAY LIMITING INTENSITY IRE YOU TUCKING ABOUT LIMITING THE NUMBER A SETS TO FAILURE I TOOK HIM OUT AM A REALLY BEING KIND OF LIA LAZY BEARE IN THE GIM I LIKE TO DO THEVER ONTO LONG LONG REST TO THAT SORT OF THING I'M WHAT IT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AS IT RELAITES TO HORMONE OPTIMISATION SO I'LL JUST MENTION AND THEN I'L LET YOU ANSWER I FEEL BEST OVER ALL WHEN I'M TRAINING FOR TEN MINUTE WARM UPS IN ABOUT FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY MINUTES OF WAIHT TRAINING WHERE I'M PRETTY LAZY BETWEEN SETS TWO TO THREE MINUTE REST S TRAINING SOMEWHERE IN THE SIX TO TEN RAP RANGE GOING TO FAILURE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE BUT MOSTLY GETTING THAT SORT OF LAST REPT BEFORE WHEN I WOULD THING IS FAILURE NO FORSE TRAPS THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN JOGGING ON THE OTHER DAYS NICE AND EASY WHEN I DO THAT I FEEL FANTASTIC IN ALL OTHER DIMENSIONS OF LIFE WHEN I TRAIN MORE INTENSELY THAN THAT EVEN WITH LIGHT WEIGHT SO FASTER CATINS IN LOWER REST I FEEL LIKE GARBAG I GET A HEAD ACHE  IN ORNERY I EVERYTHING SUFFERS SO WHAT AE YOUR THOUGHTS ON KIND OF AT DEFINING IT OPTIMAL EXERCISE DRAGY FOR FORMONS I'VE NEVER MEASURED MY HORMONES AND THOSE TWO DIFFERENT CONTECTS BUT A HAVE TO IMAGIN THAT ITS CORTIS ALL RELATED WHEN THEY STUDY THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE SPECIFICALLY VIGOROUS EXERCISE A ONE AIREA THAT'S BEEN STUDIED IS A VIGOROUS EXERCISE EPISODES LASTING LONGER THAN AN HOUR AND THEY USUALLY TRACK IT BY A RATING OF PERCEIVED EXERTION WHICH ISN'T PERFECT AND ITS NOT EXTREMELY ACTIONAL BUT IT'S HELPFUL FOR CLINICAL SCIENCE BUT THE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT IS BASICALLY DO NOT IT IS NOT HORMONALLY HELPFUL TO TRAIN ESPECIALLY REGULARLY TRAIN AVIGOROUSLY FOR LONGER THAN AN HOUR GETS IT IM I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE SOUNDS LIKE FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT HOUR OF WORK IS REALLY THE THRESHOLD AN THIS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ESPECIALLY A MALES BECAUSE I THINK WITH ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE EXAMPLES OUT THERE PEOPLE LIKE CAM LIKE DAVID GOGINS PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINING FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME YOU KNOW AND LEAVING A SIDE 'M ALL ISSUES OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE A RECOVERY I THINK AN HOUR A DAY OF EXERCISE IS JUST A GREAT PROGRAME M A THAT MOST ANY ONE CAN FOLLOW AND BEYOND AN HOUR YOU START RUNNING INTO CHALLENGES AND I YOU KNOW THE OCCASIONAL NINETY MENAT OR TO OUR WORK OUT AS NOBE DEAL BUT IF YOU START DOING THAT MORE THAN ONCE EVERY TO MONTHS I THINK YOUR HEADED FOR TROUBLE HAVE YOU SEEN THAT IN PEOPLE'S BLOOD BLOOD WORK AND IN THEIR HORMONTS YOU EVER SEE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST BADLY OVER TRAIND BECAUSE HIT IS TRAINING TOO HARD AND TOO OFTEN YES WHEN THE BLOOD WORK IS PARTICULARLY BAD THEYARE OFTEN IN A LARGE CLORIC DEPISIT AS WELL THERE IS A CYNERGISTIC EFFECT BETWEEN A CLORIC DEPISIT AEVEN IF YOU ARE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE PROTEEN AND TAKE YOU MIGHT NOT BE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE IRON AND TAKE OR ADEQUATE FIGHT OF INDEE AND YOU'RE ALSO JUST LITERALLY IN A CLORIC DEPISIT PERHAPS LOW CARBS AS WELL VERY LOW FREE TESTOSTERON AND THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY DOING A LOT OF VIGOROUS EXERCISE I OFTEN HERE AND I'M STARTING TO WONDER WHETHER NOT SOME OF THE IAM QUICKER TO RESULTS NUTRICIAN TACTICS THINGS LIKE DROPPING ALL CARBOHYDRATES WER IM THE QUICKER TO RESULTS EXERCISE HABITS LIKE STARTING YOU TO SIX DAY A WEEK REALLY INTENSE WORK OUTS WHETHER OR NOT IN THE SHORT RUN THEY WORK BECAUSE THEY CAUSE THE COSMATIC CHANGES THET PEOPLE ARE SEEKING BUT THAT THEY REALLY UNDERMINE THE OVERALL GOAL WHICH IS AT LEAST TO ME TO HAVE YOUR HORMONS MAYBE NOT OPTIMIZE TO THE YOUKN A HUNDRED PER CENT BUT TO ALWAYS TO BE AIMING FOR A HUNDRED PER CENT AND BE CLOSE TO IT AT EVERY STAGE OF LIFE CONSISTENCY IS KEY HERE IF YOU ARE NOT CONSISTENT THEN A THE LAW DIMINISH IN RETURN CERTAINLY APPLIES SO EIGHTY OR NINETY PER CENT OF THE BENEFIT OVER MANY MANY MONTHS IS FAR BETTER THAN A HUNDRED PER CENT BUT  ONLY HALF THE TIME YAT ONE THING THAT I'VE FOUND TO BE TREMENDOUSLY USEFUL IS TO FINISH THE WORK OUT WHILE I STILL HAVE ENERGY DO NOT TAKE MYSELF TO EXHAUSTION AND THEN I'M ABLE TO COUNT OF TUK ABOUT THE DOVEMIN WAVE PULL I'M ABLE THI SRIDE THAT INTO THE REST OF THE DAY FEELING GREAT I ICE OR AM SAVE OR BANK SOME OF THE VIGOR FROM THE TRAINING TO BRING IT INTO MY WORK BUT THEN A GET I'M NOT AN ATHLETE II GET A TO THINK IN THE SPEAK NOT TO A NOT TO LIFT WAITS OR TO RUN ANOTHER COMPONER THAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN YOUR SYMPATHETIC WHICH IS YOUR FIGHT OR FLIGHT NERVOUS SYSTEM AND YOUR PARI SYMPATHETIC WHICH IS YOUR RESTOR DIGEST NERVOUS SYSTEM THERE IS AN ANECDOTE WHICH IS LIKELY TRUE THAT MANY A LEAT BODY BUILDERS ARE VERY PARI SYMPATHETIC BESIDES WHILE THEY'RE LIFTING WEIGHTS SEEMING THEY'RE LAZY AND THEY LIKE TO EAT A LOT THE LAZY BARE IN THE GIM CHIN OF PHENOMENON ABSOLUTELY A BUT THAT BEING SAID AFTER A VERY VERY VIGOROUS WORK OUT FOR EXAMPLE ONE WHERE YOUR TRAIN TO FAILURE WHICH BODY BUILDERS AND POWER LIFTERS DO ALL THE TIME YOU FEEL THE A TIREDNESS OR YOU FEEL THE STRAIN FROM THAT HEAVY A SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY WHEN YOU ARE LIFTING TO HEAVY WEIGHT AND IT CAN POTENTIALLY EFFECT HOW YOU FEEL THE REST OF THE DAY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE A JOB WHERE THAT IS HIGHLY COGNITIVE DO NOT LIKE TO HAVE AN EXTREMELY VIGOROUS WORK OUT IN THE MORNING WHICH IS WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO EXERCISE WHEN I EXERCISE EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT IS BEFORE NINE A M I HAVE MORE ENERGY ALL DAY LONG IF I DO AT MID MORNING I HAVE EXPERIENCE MORE OF AN AFTERNOON CRASHS BY SOME CIRCADIAN BIOLOGY IN THERE I WALZER NOTICED AND I'VE ASHALLY SEEN IN MY BLOOD WORK THAT IF I DON'T GET OUT FOR A FORTY FIVE MINUTE JOG AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK ALL OF MY BLOOD PROFILES SUFFER IN DIRECTION THAN I DON'T WANT THEM TO GO IN PARTICULAR TESTOSTERON AND ESTEROGEN MOVE IN DIRECTIONS THAT ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TO MY GOLLS AM I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE APPROACHES THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IN ORDER TO OPTIMISE HORMONTS AND THESE DAYS FOR BETTER FOR WORSE I THINK FOR WORSE YOUNGER GUYES ARE ASKING ABOUT AND USING TESTOSTERON REPLACEMENT THERE BE SO CALLED T ARTA AND I JUST WANT O FRAME THIS OUT BY SAYING THERE IS NO STRICT CUT OFF FOR WHAT IS T AR TA THERRE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHOS A BLOOD LEVELS OF TESTOSTERO AND ESTEROGEN ARE IN T WITHIN THE NORMAL REFERENCE RANGE AND DECIDE TO START DOING THESE THINGS COURSE THEY CAN LIMITE FERTILITY THERR BUNCH OF ISSUES EVEN AT NON QUOTING QU STEROIDOLL AA PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DOSAGES AM I'D LOVE TO FRAME THIS OUT BY FIRST DEFINING OUR TERMS BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALENGES ON THE ENTERNES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT T AR TEE THEN THEYLL TALK ABOUT PERFORMANCE IN HANCING DRUGS HEY'LL TALK ABOUT STIRROIDS THEY'RE ALL STEROIDS O IDOM IN TESTOSTERON ESTERN ARE BOTH STEROID HORMONES BUT WHAT ONE CONSIDERED REPLACEMENT THERE BE VERSES WHAT ONE CONSIDERS PERFORMANCE AN HANCING IS CAN A DEPEND RIGHT SO HERE'S MY QUESTION WHY IN THE WORLD WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD ANY MALE IN HIS TEENS OR TWENTIES WORTH EVEN THIRTIES WHOSE BLOOD LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE AND ESTERGEN ARE AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS ME WITHIN THE NORMAL REFERENCE RANGE WHY WOULD THEY TAKE EXOGEONIUS TUSTSTERONE GIVEIN ALL THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS N FERTILITY I'M SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT IT CAN PRESENT IF THE DOSAGES AREN'T QUITE RIGHT ET CETERA WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT CERTAINLY IF THEY ARE NOT BEIN PAID FOR PARTICULAR ENDEAVOR LIKE THE NOT MAKING MONEY IF THERE ARE PLAYING ASPORT CHANCES ARETHER NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT ANYWAY IT'S ION THE BAN SUBSTANCES LIST SO TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A CRAZY IDEA AM BUT THEN AGAIN I'M OF A GENERATION THAT REALLY HASN'T THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT STUFF UNTIL PEOPLEWE IN THEIR FORTIES AN FIFTIES WER EVEN NEVER SO IS THERE EVER A CASE FOR SOMEBODY IN THEIR TWENTIES OR THIRTES TO TAKE TOSTOSTERONE ESPECT IF THEIR BLOOD LEVELS ARE WITHIN THE THREE HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDERED NANIGRAMS PERDES TA LEADER REFERENCE RANGE NOT MANY CASES THE REASON FOR ANY PERFORMANCE AND HANCING DRUG WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A STEROID SYNTHETIC BYIDENTICAL OR OTHERWISE A IT VARIES A LOT SOME INDIVIDUALS DO IT ONLY FOR COSMATIC REASONS M EVEN IF IT CAN AHAVE DELATERIOUS EFFECTS ON A LIKE THE COSMATIC APPEARANCE FOR EXAMPLE OF YOUR SKIN IN A LONG RUN BUT A THEY KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR DIFFERENT REASON AS FAR AS LIKE WHEN DOES THE BENEFIT OUTWEIGH THE DETRIMENT NOT VERY OFTEN IF HERE A IN YOUR TWENTIESNT CERTAINLY A PROBABL ALMOST HARDLY NEVER THERE'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW BAIR CASES LIKE CALMIN CENDROM IT WHAT NOT BUT  ALMOST NEVER IF YOU WERE VERY YOUNG O CASE SO FOR BEBLE INERE TWENTY THIRTIES AND BEYOND FORTIES ET CETERA WHOSE TESTOSTRONE AND ESTERGEN LEVELS ARE AT THE APPROPRIATE RATIOS AND IN WITHIN THE NORMAL REFERENCE RANGE AND THEY FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGH WHETHER HADAMS EXAMINA THE SOR LIKE FEEL PRETTY GOOD AS HOR CODE FOR A LIBIDO ENERGY RECOVERY ET CETERA AND AR FEELING YOUR LEAST AM WORKABLE FOR IT FOR THEIR LIFE STYLE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHAT CAN THEY DO BESIDES GET GREAT SLEEP TRAIN BUT NOT TOO HARD OR TOO OFTEN ET CETERA ET CETERA WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS IN THE REALM OF SUPPLEMENTATION THAT CAN HELP THEM OPTIMIZE THEIR TOSTOSTERONE AN ESTEROGEN WITHOUT SUPPRESSING THEIR OWN INDOGINOUS PRODUCTION OF TOSTOSTRON AN ESTROGEN LET'S MENTION CREATINE IS THE FIRST ONE CREATINE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE AT AS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT EFFECTS AT HELPS WITH MENOASIT SYNTHESIS IT ALSO HELPS WITH OXIDATEOF STRESS IT CAN ALSO SERVE AS THE BACK UP FUEL TANK FOR YOURMOTICONDRE SO KIND OF HOLDING BACK UP E T P AND IT DOES SLIGHTLY INCREASE TOTAL TESTOSTERONE AND IT ALSO INCREASES THE CONVERSION OF TOSTOSTERONE TO DIHYDRA TO STOSTERONE SU POTENTIALLY IT'S ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN A MEN IN THER EVEN THEIR TEEN AE YEARS AND THEIR TWENTIES YOU MENTION THE CONVERSION OF TOSTOSTRON TO DIHYDRO ESTOSTRON AND THERE IS MITHOLOGY OUT THERE THAT CREATIN CAN INCREASE HAIR LOSS I'M GUESSING BECAUSE THERE'S AT LEAST ONE STUDY SHOWING THAT CREATIN CAN INCREASE THE H T DIHYDRA TOSTOSTRON ANH T IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY HARMONS THAT CAN PROMOTE MAL PATTERN BALDNESS SO THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS DOES CREAI CREATINE SUPPLEMENTATION INCREASE THE RATE OF HAIRLOSS THEORETICALLY AT CAN BUT A ININ EACH INDIVIDUAL A PREVENTINE HAIRLOSS IS A VERY POOR REASON O TCREATINE BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE YOU TOO A SUPRA PHYSIOLOGIC LEVEL IT'S NOT GOING TO A YOU KNOW INCREASE YOUR ANDROGENS TO AN UNNORMAL LEVEL OF BINDING SO I FEEL LIKE A THIS IF THAT WAS A REASON TO NOT TAKE CREATINE FOR HAIRLOSS THEN ANY SORT SORRY YOU MEAN HAIRLOSS IS NOT A REASON TO AVOID TAKING CREATINE CORRECT HAIRLOSS IS NOT A REASON TO AVOID TAKING CREATINE M IT THINK OF IT AS JUST BRINGING YOU TO WHAT YOU ARE AM NATURALLY INCLINED TO HAVE IF YOUR CONVERSION OF TESTOSTRON  D H T IS AREADY HIGH THEN OFTEN CREATINE DOES NOT EFFECT THIS IT JUST KIND OF RESETS YOUR BALANCE BETWEEN TESTOSTRONE BEING A ROMATIZED TO ESTROGEN OR BEING FIVE AL FOR ADUCED D H T SO IT'S NOT GING TO SPEED UP HAIRLOSS MORE THAN AM JUST NATURALLY BE AMAIL DOES SO IN SOME INDIVIDUALS IT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT IN SOME INDIVIDUALS FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY HAVE ALMOST NO FIVE AFORA DOCTASTE ACTIVITY HAT WILL RETURN THEM TO NATURAL OR NORMAL I SEE WAT I TAKE FIVE GRAMS A DAY OF CREATINE MON A HIDRATE I DO IT FOR THE IM TISSUE VOLUMNIZING EFFECTS OFOR EXERCISE BENEFITS BUT ALSO FOR THE COGNIVE EFFECTS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S INCREASING MY HAIR LOSSOM IN AV GOT LITTLE BIT OF A SORT OF A WIDOW'S PE TIE HAIRLOSS THAT'S WHERE IT IS FOR ME AM I SUPPOSE BEARD GROWTH ASSOCIAT WITH THE H T TOO MUST IS THAT RIGHT I MT WHAT I LEARNED BUT THEN AGAIN I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE LEGERN A LONG TIME IS THAT BECAUSE OF CANE DIFFERENCES IN RECEPTORS THAT D SHE CAUSES HAIRGROWTH ON THE FACE AND HIR LOSS ON THE HAD IS THAT RIGHT YES AND THE AMOUNT IN THE SENSITIVITY AND DENSITY OF THOSE RECEPTORS IS GENETICALLY DETERMINED AND IS IT TRUE THAT IF YOUR MOTHER'S FATHER WAS BALD THAT YOU WILL BE BAWLD IN THE SAME PATTERN AND IF THAT HE WASN'T YOU WON'T THAT IS A DECENT CORRELATION PART OF THE PROPOSED MECHANISM OF THIS WHEL THER SEVERAL GENES AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY TESTROGENES FOR HAIRLOSS YOU DO GET AT DECENT AMOUNT OF THEM FROM YOUR MOTHER THE UNIQUE THING YOU GET FROM YOUR MOTHER THAT SHE MAY HAVE GOTTEN FROM HER FATHER THAT SHE GOT ONE OF THE COPIES FROM HER FATHER IS YOUR EX CROMASOM AN THE ANDROGEN RECEPTRGENE IS ON YOUR EXCROMASOM SO ALL MEN GOT THEIR ANDROGEN RECEPTER GENE FROM THEIR MOTHER IT'S ON THEIR EX CROMAISOM NOT ON THE WY CROMASOV CORRECT INTERESTING EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THA SORT OF A COULDN'T UO MAL MAIL PROMOTING A GENES ARE ON THE WI CROMAZON LIKE MOLARIAN INHIBITING ET CETERA INTERESTING O CASE OF FIVE GRAMS A DAY OF CREATINE FOR MOST PEOPLE SHOULD BE FINE I'M BENEFICIAL FOR TISSUE VOLMNIZING O STRENGTH A BRING WATER INTO THE MUSCLES AND ND FOR COGNAT THE COGNIM EFFECTS AND THE CLINICAL SUPPORT RGREETING I THINK IT'S IS QUITE STRONG AT THE PHIGRAM PREDADOSAGE A WHAT OTHER SORTS OF SUPPLEMENTS AM CAN PEOPLE BENEFIT FROM WE ALRAY TALKED ABOUT THE OMEGAS AND MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING ENOUGH PREBIOTIC FIBR OT TO SUPPORT THE GUPMACRO BYOM IM INVITE HIM INDE A SO WHAT OTHER SUPPLEMENT BASE TOOLS I CAN PEOPLE CONSIDER ANOTHER WOMAN CAN LOOP IN WITH CREATINE AS BATA INE SOME PEOPLE ARE NON RESPONDERS TO CREATINES YOU CAN INCREASE THAT TO TEN GRAMS OR YOU CAN USE ITS COUSIN BATE INE TO HELP WITH THE MENO ACIT SYNTHESIS AND SHUNTINE OF ENERGY ALONG WITH THAT I WOULD PUT ELL CARNATINE WHICH IS AACTUALLY THE SMALLEST PEPTITE HORMONAS JUST TWO EMENOACITS THAT ARE PUT TOGETHER SO IT'S A IT'S A HORMA A INTEREST I'M NOT CHALLENGE HAITIZE YEI'M NOT CHALI CHALL IT UP A PEPTIDE IIT MORE THAN A HORMON YE I I WOULD NOT CALL EL CARNATINO HORMONE BUT I WOULD CALL ITOPENMINO A HORMONE I COULD A YOM ANERRO HORMON IT'S TSO ART TO DEFINE THINGS AS TRANSMARERS OR HORMONES AT SOME LEVEL I AGREE IM SO ELL CARNATINE I ASHASHOULD BACKTRACK BATAIN AUDO YOU RECALL A WHAT DOSAGE PEOPLE TYPICALLY WOULD TAKE IF THEIR I CREATING NON RESPONDER ONE TO THREE GRAMS D I  YE SEVERAL VERSIONS OF CREATING HAVE BATA EN MIXEDIN BECAUSE IT HELPS WITH THE PROCESSING OF MATHYININE AND HOMOSISTINE SO IF SOMEBODY IS ALREADY TAKING CREATINE AND LIKES IT IN RESPONSE TO IT O RAISE MY HAND SUCH AS MYSELF WOULD ADDING BATAINE HELP OR IS IT REDUNDANT WITH CREATINE ONLY IF THEIR HOMOASSISTING AS PERSISTENTLY ELEVATED N HOMOSSISTING AS CANNALIKE AN INFLAMATORY MARKER THAT CAN BUILD UP IF YOU'RE NOT CONVERTING ENOUGH OF IT DOWN THE STREE HOW WOULD I KNOW  JUST THE BLOOD TUST CANWER IF YOU KNEW YOUR M T A CHEPHAR POLYMORPHISM WHUCH JIS BASICALLY HOW YOU A AD METHEL GROUPS TO A MANY THINGS IN THE BODY GREAT ANY SIDE EFFECTS ABATINE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BEWARE OF NOT THAT I KNOW O BE WE LOOK IT UP AND O EXAMINE NOT COMS AGREAT SIGHT FOR THAT THEY'LL SURELY LIST IT THEY JUST REVAMPED THEIR SIGHTE BY THE WAY AND IT WAS OSSUM BEFORE AND ITS PLATINUM NOW AM SO ELL CARNATINE A WHAT ARE THE WAYS TO TAKE ELL CARNATINE I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ORAL FORMS OF CAPSALS AND THERE IS INJECTABLES INJECTABLES I THINK YOU NEED A PRESCRIPTION IS THAT RIGHT CORRECT OU NEN TO PRESCRIPTION FOR THE INJECTABLES OR YOU SU REALLY GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE INJECTABLES FOR WHEN YOU INJECT IT A OF COURSE AT THE SUPERVISION OF YOUR DOCTOR IT'S USUALLY DONE INTROMUSCULARLY IT'S AN AQUIOUS SOLUTION SO IT DOES NOT HAVE LIKE AN OIL OR A CARRIER OIL IN IT LIKE TAR LIKE TOSTOSTRON ESTRS TO HOWEVER IF YOU INJECT IT TO SUPERFICIALLY IT'S NOT G TO MAKE A RAKE ANYTHING OFTEN IT JUST BURNS IF YOU INJECT IT SUBSUTANEOUSLY AND IT IS NOT U DISSEMINATE THROUGHOUT THE BODY AS WELL ELL CARNATINE POTENTIALLY HAS LOCALIZED EFFECTS IF YOU INJECT IT IF YOU INJEST T IT ORALY THEN IT AS A VERY LITTLE BILE AVAILABILITY MAYBE ONLY TEN PER CENT BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET EL CARNATINE ONLY OR YOU NONT IN ITS CAPSAL FORM SO WHAT ARE THE DOSE USE OF EL CARNATINE THAT ONE NEEDS TO INJEST THEN IF THEY ONE TO GET A BENEFIT BECAUSE 'F ONLY TEN PERCENT IS BEING ABSORBED IIT'S PALLY A LOT OF EL CARNATINE HOW MUCH SHOULD PEOPLE TAKE PRUDE YOUSHOULD I RECOMMEND A FOR ORAL EL CARNATINE BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND MELOGRAMS AND UP TO FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND MELOGRAMS WONDERFOR MAYBE EVEN FIVE GRAMS CORRECT O G UP TO FIVE GRAMS A DAY IF YOU'RE ON THAT MUCH ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A DISREGULATED GOT MICROBIUM YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH T MA O WHICH IS A PETENTIAL CARCENAGINE THAT BOTH CARNATINE AND COLINE CAN CONVERTINT TO AND YOU'RE GOT MICROBIOT A DETERMINE HOW MUCH THAT HAPPENS UT IS IT TRUE THAT I CAN OFFSET ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALPA G P C A COLINE THAT IS AN EL CARNATINE I'M THAT I TAKE BY INGESTING GARLIC IS THAT RIGHT THERE'S A COMPOUND IN GARLIC CALLED ALISON I BELIEVE IT'S A LL I C IEN IT'S ALSO PART OF THE SCIENTIFIC NAME THE GENUS OF A TYPES OF GARLIC AND THIS CAN'T HELP DECREASE THE CONVERSION TOT MAO BERBERING ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY DECREASEF THE CONVERSION TO T MAO IS WELL I'M PROBABLY THROUGH ALTERATION OF THE CUT MICROBIUM AND THEN JUST AM OPTIMIZING YOUR GOT MY CROBIUM CAN DECREASE CONVERSION SO NOT EVERYONE NEEDS ALISON BUT IT SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER IF YOU WERE ON A HIDOS I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO TAKE THE SIX HUNDR MELIGRAMS OF GARLIC EVERY TIME I TAKE MY EL CARNATINE BUT I AM GOING TO SKIP THE BERBERING GAS BERBERING GIVES ME BRUTAL HEADACHES AND MAKES ME CRAVE CARBOHIDRATES BECAUSE IT DROPS MY BLOOD SUGAR IT HAS MANY OTHER EFFECTS INCLUDING THE DON PHENOMENON WHERE IT DROPS YOUR BLOOD SUGAR WHEN YOUR SLEEPING AND YOU CAN'T EVEN REALIZE IT I AM NOT A FAN OF BERBERINE AND I'M SORRY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE IMM NOT TRYING TO OFFEND ANY ONE ABOUT FRANKLY IF YOU'RE BEING OFFENDED BY MYT STANDS ON BERBERING HAN MAYBE WE SHULD HAE ANOTHER DISCUSSION IN ANY CASE IM INJECTABLE AL CARNATINE IF ONE CAN GET THAT THROUGH A DOCTOR HOW MUCH IS ABSORBED IN HOW MUCH SHOULD ONE TAKE ALMOST ALL OF IT'S ABSORBED IN GENERAL YOU'RE TAKINE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MELOGRAMS UP TO YOU CON TAKE A PRETTY HYDOSE UP TO TWO THOUSAND MELOGRAMS WHO CAN WHAT WE DID NOT TALK ABOUT IS WHAT EL CARNATINE DOES SO WHY SHOULD WHY SHOULD SOME ONE GO THROUGH ALL THIS IS IT DOPTOMIZE TOSTOSTERONE IS IT I'M WORKING ON THE RECEPTOR SIDE WHAT WHAT'S EL CARNATINE DOING IT'S A SHUTTLE SO I THINK IT'S NAMED CARNATINE PALMATIL COINSIME A BASICALLY ITS IT JUST TAKES NEW TRANTS FROM OUTSIDE DRAMODICONDRIA AND PUTS THEM IN AND ALSO HAS A UNIQUE EFFECT WE'LL NOT TO UNIQUE BECAUSE TODALIFEL ACTUALLY HAS IS EFFECT AS WELL IS THAT IT INCREASES THE DINCET OF THE ANTROGEN RECEPTER IN THE SIDOPLASAN OF YOURSELVES SO EVEN IF YOUR ENERGEN RECEPTOR SENSITIVITY DOESN'T CHANGE AND EVEN IF YOUR DOESN'T TASTOSTEROE DOES NOT CHANGE YOU WILL HAVE MORE TESTOST ER ON BIDING TO THAT INCREASED NUMBER OF RECEPTRS DOES ONE NEED TO CYCLE I CARNATINE CREATINE BEDINE NO REASON TO CYCLE ANY OF THOSE OK WHAT OTHER SUPPLEMENTS CAN ONE USE TO CHIN IMPROVE FORMON PROFILES AN AND HERE I REALIZE WERE USING A VERY BROADBRUSH BECAUSE WE SAY IMPROVE HORMON PROPHILES WHAT ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT AND FOR ME AT LEAST I I THINK ABOUT THE SUBJECTIVE UM STOFF YOU KNOW DU PEOPLE WILL FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE ENERGY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF DOING THESE THINGS ARE THEY GOING T HAVE THE A MORE OPTIMIZED LEBIDO ARE THEY CAN HAVE MORE OPTIMIZED A RECOVERY FROM EXERCISE RA BECAUSE IM IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT TAKING ONCE TESTOSTRON FROM SIX HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A GOOD THING ESPECIALLY IF ESTERGEN IS INCREAS ING IN PARALLEL THAT COULD CAUSE ISSUES IT COULD CERTAINLY MAKE THINGS BETTER IT COULD CERTAINLY MAKE THINGS WORSE RIGHT SO O WITH THAT BACK DROP A WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS PEOPLEL CAN TAKE AND WILL GO BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF WHAT REALLY IS OPTIMISATION LET'S BRIEFLY MENTION INVITEM IN D WHICH IS ALSO A HORMONE IT'S ACTUALLY ASTERAL HORMONE AND HAVE IF YOU HAVE DEFICIENT VITEM IN D AND YOU REPLACE IT THEN YOU WILL OPTIMIZER TASTOSTERONE ET'S ALSO MENTION BORE ON SOPHIE AV A VERY HIGH S H B G BORE ON CAN ACUTELY HELP LOWER IT USUALLY INA DOSE OF FIVE TO TWELVE MELEGRAMS PER DAY IT'S NOT REALLY A SUSTAINED EFFECT BUT A BORE ON IS TEPLEADED IN SOILS AND MANY COUNTRIES I BELIEVE IT'S VERY HIGH AND SOILS IN GREASE AND TURKEY SO EATING DATES OR RAISINS THAT ARE FROM THOSE ARIAS PATTENTUALLY HAVE MORE BORE ON BORE ON ALSO MEET MIGHT BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE REFERENCE RANGE FOR TESTOSTERONE IS MUCH HIGHER IN THOSE COUNTRIES THAN OTHER COUNTRIES AND JUST REMIND PEOPLE THE S H B G SEX FORMO MINING GLOBULANE IS ATTACHING TO THE STOSTROMOLECULE AND LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF SO CALLED FRE TESTOSTRON THAT'S AVAILABLE TO HAV ITS IN BACKNON CELLS DOCTOR PETER ITO WAS ON THIS POD GASTIN FACT SITTING IN THAT VERY CHAIR YOU SAID THAT THE IDEAL LEVEL OF FR TESTOSTRON AND MAIL SHOULD BE ABOUT TWO PER CENT OF ONE'S TOTAL TESTOSTRON DUTE WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT NUMBER OR DISAGREE I'M SURE PETER WOULD BE FINE IF YOU SAD EITHER TWO PER CENT IS A GOOD RULE THUMB USUALLY THE REFERENCE TRANGES BETWEEN ABOUT ONE AND FOUR PER CENT SOME PEOPLE DO HAVE GENETIC POLLY MORPHISMS IN S  B G A SPECIFIC GN MUTATION WHERE THEY HAVE VERY LOW S H B GS ALSO MEN THAT HAVE VERICOST VEINS IN THEIR TESTS ALSONATE AS VERICA SEALS TEN TO HAVE VERY HIGH S H B GS SO THAT PERCENTAGE WOULD LIKEALLY BE LESS THAN TWO PER CENT SO JUST BECAUSE YOURE A PER CENTAGE OF FRE T TO TOTAL T IS A LITTLE BIT ABOVE OR BELOW TWO PER CENT THAT'S O K WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE RECENT WHY IT IS HOW WOULD SOMEBODY KNOW IF THEY VERICOST VEINS IN THEIR TESTACLES UM ESPECIALLY IF THEIR TESTLES ARE STILL IN ATTASH TO THEIR BODY SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TELL A THERE IS SEVERAL GRADES IF YOU HAVE A GREAT THREE OR GREAT FOUR TEST A VERICA SIAL IT HAS WHAT'S CALLED A BAG OF WORMS APPEARANCE SO THINK ABOUT IF YOU'VE JUST RESISTANCE TRAINED OR IT'S A REALLY HOT DAY OR RE WERIN VERY TIGHT FITTING CLOTHING THEN IF YOU FEEL IT AND ALMOST FEELS LIKE THER'S WORMS IN THE SCROTUM THE OTHER WAY IS TO DO THA SCARY VISUAL A BAG OF WORMS AWE JUST THAT YA ANYWAY I THINK PARASITES WHEN I HEAR THAT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR FRIEND TO YOUR TLLING MUT JUST THE A THE THE TEXTURE THE BEST WAY FOR MOST PEOPLE TO CHECK IS TO VALSALVA FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHEN YOU VALSALVA VENUS RETURN A WELL DECREASE TINY EXPLANG VALSALVA IT'S BEARING DOWN LIKE YOU'R LIFTING AWEIGHT OR I HAVING A BAW MOVEMENT WHERE YOU A SWALLOW AND A AUT E LOT O TIMES YOU CAN ALMOST SEE A BUILD UP OF  BLOOD IN YOU'RE LIKE JUGULAR VEINS IS WELL SO YOU HAVE A INCRDECREASED BLOOD RETURN TO THE HEART AND INCREASED A BLOOD IN THE VEINS HIMSELF O CASE OF VITE HIM INDEE THREE I'M GESTING A TIME OUT BY HIM IN DE THREE SPECIFICALLY WHEN YOU SAY BAT HIM INDEED AM AND THEN BORE ON FIVE TO TWELVE MELIGRAMS PER DAY AM AND THEN WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS TO OPTIMIS AN TESTOSTERON THAT ARE IN SUPPLEMENT FOR WE COUN TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT EFFECT THA TERODOGENESIS CASCADE SO WE COULD TOUCH ON TON CAT ALE I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT BEFORE TSOVET I'M GUESTING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD THAT CONVERSATION ALSO THON AS LONG JACK AND THAT UPREGULATES SEVERAL DIFFERENT IN ZIMES IN THIS STERODIGENISIS CASCADE AND BY THAT A WHAT YOU MEAN IF AND THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD THING TO GUGLEI THINK ANYBODY INTERESTED IN HORMONOPTIMIZATION SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHERE WHERE STARE ALL HORMONES COME FROM THE COME USUALLY FROM COLLESTER ALL AND THEY CAN BE SHUNTED OFF TO VIDE HIM AND VERY EASILY THAY CAN BE SHUNTED OFF TO TASTASTERONE OR ESTROGENS OR PROGESTOGENS QUITE EASILY AS WELL BUT TONM CAT HELPS WITH THE CONVERSION AF MULTIPLE KEY STEPS WHERE YOU SYNTHESIZE TO STASTERONE ANOTHER A E THINK OF IT IS LIKE A COINZIME OR COFACTOR AN UP REGULATOR OF THESE STEPS IS INSOLENT AND IGOF ONE SO A GOOD RULE OF THUM IS IF YOU ARE NOT EXPECTING AS MUCH GROWTH HORMONE INSOLENT AND IGF ONE FOR EXAMPLE LOWER CAR DIETS COLORIC DEFISITS YOU'RE TRYING TO CUT BODY FAT OR BODYWEIGHT THEN TON CAT IS GOING TO BE THEORETICALLY ESPECIALLY POWERFUL WHAT SORTS OF DOSAGE IS OF TONGUE AT DOOU RECOMMEND YOUR PATIENCE ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS A DAY WITH TON CAT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE STANDARDIZATION BECAUSE AND IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A GENERAL TONCAT SUPPLEMENT WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST WELL STUDIED THEN A YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE YEURY COMINONE CONTENT WHICH IS AY PLANT COMPOUND THAT IS LIKELY THE MAIN A ACTIVE PHARMOCOLOGIC EFFECT SO THAT'S THE COMPOUND IS HAVING THE EFFECT ON THE BODY AND IF YOU STANDARD IES THE EARY COMANONE VERY VERY HIGH THEN THEORETICALLY YOUR HAVING MORE EFFECT AT ILOERDOSS I TAKE FOUR HUNDRED MELEGRAMS OF TONGA ALY UM PERERDAY I TAKE IT EARLY IN THE DAY BECAUSE AS A BIT OF A STIMULAN EFFECT AND IF I TAKE IT AFTER TWO PMIT STARTS TO INHIBIT MY SLEEP UM I'VE BEEN TAKING IT FOR YEARS U AND I RATHER LIKE THAT THE EFFECTS THAT IT SEEM SUBTLE BUT OU CONSISTIN I'VE NEVER CYCLED IT UM DO YOU RECOMMEND CYCLING IT I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO CYCLE IT A THERE IS A THERE IS A REASON TO CYCLE SOME SUPPLEMENTS BUT NO REASON TO CYCLE TONCA MY BLOODWORK TELLS ME THAT IT CAUSES AN INCREASE IN FREE TESTOSTRON FOR ME AND ALSO A SLIGHT INCREASE IN LUTINIZING HORMON FOR ME UM WHAT ARE SOMEOF THE OTHER EFFECTS ON VERY TORMONTSAT U OBSERVED IN THE BLOODWORK OF YOUR PATIENTS TAKING TONGA ALY TON CAT CAN ALSO SLIGHTLY INCREASE D  G A AND IF YOU HAVE A VERY HIGH ES H B G AGAIN THAT'S THE PROTEENE THAT BINDS UP YOUR ANDRGENS AND ESTRGENS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PROTEENE THE HIGHER YOUR ES H B G THE MORE HELPS D CREASE IT SO THEY'VE STUDIED TONG CAT IN A POPULATIONS WITH VERY NORMAL ESS H B GS AND IT DOES NOTHING FOR ESS H B G INTERESTING DOES THAT MING IT DOES NOTHING FOR SOMEBODY OVER ALL SO SOMEBODY HAS SS H B G THAT'S IN THE NORMAL RANGE WILL TAKING TONGGOT BENEFIT THEM IN ANY OTHER WAY YES IT IT'LL INCREASE THEIR TOTAL AND FREE TESTOSTERONE GOT IT UM OKTE DOES IT IS IT NO NA F EFFECTS ON ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THIROD ORMON GROWTH HORMONERS I PURELY IN THESE ESTERI SINCESIS PATHWAYS WERE STEROID I SHOULD SAY AS SYNTHES'S AND RECEPTOR AND MODULATION PATHWAYS THERE'S NO DIRECT EFFECT ON THOSE PATHWAYS HOWEVER ANY TIME YOU ALTER YOUR FREE ANDROGEN OR FREE ESTRGEN A PARTICULARLY ONE WITHOUT ALTERING THE OTHER IT WILL ALTER THE BINDING PROTEEN THAT BINDS THIROID HORMONES SO ANY CHANGE YOU MAKE WHETHER IT'S NATURAL OPTIMIZATION OR HORMON REPLACEMENT YOU'RE GOING TO SLIGHTLY SKEWES YOUR THIROID HORMON PROFILE ONE COMMON LIKE ACTIONABLE EXAMPLE OF THIS THAT I SEE OFTEN CLINICALLY IS A SOME ONE STARTS LET' SAY ESTRGEN REPLACEMENT OR TESTOSTERN REPLACEMENT MAYBE THEY'RE TAKING A I WITH THEIR TESTOSTERN REPLACEMENT AT ROMATIS IN HIBITOR CORRECT AN ROMATATES AN EVITER WHICH BLOCKS THE CONVERSION TO ESTERGEN IF THEY'RE TAKEENG TESTASTERON AND THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE ESTERGEN THAN YOUARE GOING TO DECREASE THE BINDING PROTEENE ALSO IN AS THIROCK SINE BINDING GLOBULAN WHICH BINDS ACTIVE THIROID HORMONES SO IF YOU START A T R T AND YOU EITHER HAVE LOW AROMATAS ACTIVITY OR NO AROMATAES ACTIVITY NO CONVERSION TO ESTRGEN THAN YOURE FREE THYROD HORMONES WILL GO UP EVEN JUST ACUTELY IT USUALLY FEEDBACK IN HIBITION WHICH IS HOW THE BODY TALKS TO ITSELF AND SAYS YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE MORE OF THIS OR LESS OF THIS BUT ACUTELY THERE'S A NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH TIME YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE VERY HIGH FIROD HORMONES AND YOU CAN HAVE TACKA CARDIA WHICH IS A FAST HART RATE WHERE YOU CAN FEEL KIND OF LIKE OVERLY FIGHT OR FLIGHT DUE TO INCREASE FIROD HORMON ACTIVITY IN THE IN TISSUE INTERESTING A CASE OF TONGALY THIS S A BROAD RANGE THREE HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRE MELEGRAMS PER DAY AND I REALIZE THAT THE SOURCE MATTERS THERE AM WHAT ERE SOME OF THE OTHER HORMONES THAT YOU PRESCRIBED YOUR PATIENTS WHO DO NOT WANT TO GO ON TESTOSTERON REPLACEMENT THEREAPE WER TAKE EXOCENS T  E OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT FIDOSIA NEXT FIDOGIAS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S A GENUS OF PLANTS VEDOSIA AGRESTUS IS ONE OF THEM THERE'S MANY OTHERS THAT ARE VERY INTERESTING ATHAT SPECIES IS LIKELY THE MOST WELL STUDIED AND IT WILL INCREASE L H SA A AS I WOULD NOT CONSIDERAT  H MAMETIC SO DOESN'T REALLY MIMIC IT BUT IT INCREASES THE RELEASE OF LUTINIZING HORMON FROM THE PATUITARIAS A HORMON THAT FINDS TO THE LADIG CELL TO THE LET RECEPTER KIND OF LIKE H C G DOES AND IT WILL INCREASE THE RELEASE OF TOSTOSTERONE I SEE SO I THINK FOR PEOPLE IN ARN' FAMILIAR WITH H C G SO HUMAN CORYONIC ANATITROPIN IS BASILY SYNTHETIC LUINIZING HORMONE AND LUTNIZING HORMON IS THE HORMONE RELEASE FROM THE PATUITARY THAT IS GOING TO TRAVEL DOWN TO THE TESTIES TO STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF SPERM AN TESTOSTERONE BUT MAINLY TESTOSTRONE IS THAT CORRECT A MOSTLY CORRECT A TECHNICALLY SYNTHETIC L HIS ALSO AS LITTLE R L H OR RECOMMIDENT L H AN H C G CAN B SYNTHETIC BUT OFTEN IT IS JUST REFINE FROM THE URIN OF PREGNANT LADIES SINCE TH A IT SINCE THE PLESYNTIMIX IT THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED CORIONIC AMGANATA TROPEN S WHERE ARE THEY GETTING ALL THIS PREGNAN A WOMANS UREIN I MEAN IS EBING THERE'S THEREA A LOCATION  NOT THAT I WANT TO GO THONATION IS E I REALLY SO THER'RE WHEN MERSAN RIHT MASTER PREGNANT LADIES IT'S VERY HIGH DONATING THERE URINE AND THEN THE'RE PURIFYING IT AND THEN MEN ARE INJECTING IT YES WEL AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SAME FOR MEN APOSTLE LADIES O FIRST TRIMASTER PREGNANT LADIES THAT'S HOW YOU CAN MAKE A YOU KNOW NON SYNTHETIC H C G AND THEN FOR MINITROPINS WHICH ARE ALSO KNOWN THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT NAMES FOR IT LIKE MINNO PURE A YOU HAVE BEEN APOSTLE LADIES THAT HAVE VERY HIGH L H AND EFFAS H AND THEN YOU REFINE THE FFASATION ELAGE O CA SO AM MOVING AWAY FROM THE SOURCES AND FROM URIN A FIDOGIAGRESTUS WHAT DOSAGEIS A DO YOU HAVE PATIENCE TAKE I'VE HERD OF A SOME POTENTIAL TOCTICITY TO THE TESTICULAR SELLS THERE IS ONE STUDY IN THIS IS A RATS STUDY BUT YOU CAN EQUATE THE DOSE OF TOCICITY IN RATS IN HUMANS THEY DID NOT GIVE THESE RATS ANY ANTIOCCIDENTS BUT IT INCREASES A COUPLE DIFFERENT A IK PROIN FLAMATORY MARKERS ONE IS G G T OR GAMIGLUTAMEL TRANSFERACE COMES FROM BOTH THE TESTIES AND THE LIVER AND ONE IS ALKAL AND PHOSPHITASE ALSO IN AS ALK PHOS AGAIN COMING FROM BOTH AREAS THERE'RE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN ATTENUATE THIS INCREASE AND YOU CAN ALSO JUST CHECK TO SEE IF YOU HAVE INCREASED IN THE RAT DOSE THAT I QUAITS WITH HUMANS THAT HAD NO EFFECT SO THE SAFE DOSE WAS AN AVERAGE OF THREE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS A DAY SO THAT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS A DAY IN HUMANS IS THE DOSAGE THAT DID NOT HAVE TOXICITY CORRERECT AND OFTEN EVEN IF THERE IS TOXICITY IN RATS THERE IS NOT TEXASANY HUMAN SO IT'S NOT DIRECTLY EQUITABLE BUT TO BE SAFE IM ANOTHER REGIMEN THAT I HAVE PEOPLE TAKE HIS SIX HUNDRED MELEGRAMS EVERY OTHER DAY OR SIX HUNDRED MELEGRAMS THREE TIMES A WEEK OFTEN MONDAY WENESDAY FRIDAY THIS VERY INTERESTING AND INRELEVANT BECAUSE I I'VE BEEN TAKING FIDOGIA FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME M ALL MY MARKERS AND AND TESS A INDICATE THAT THERE'S NO TUXICITY BUT UM I'VE BEEN TAKING SIX HUNDRED MELEGRAMS PER DAY BUT I'VE BEEN CYCLING IT FOR ABOUT UM EIGHT TO TWELVE WEEKS ON AND THEN A FEW WEEKS OFF BUT I S ONWO YOURE SAYING I'M THINKING MAY BE THREE TIMES PER WEEK OR OR EVERY OTHER DAY MIGHT BE BETTER IS AT RIGHT IF YOU AREN'T GOTTO GET ANY LABS THAT IS CERTAINLY RITHE REGIMEN THAT YOU WANT IF YOU'RE GIN TO CHECK YUR G G T AND ALK PHOSS OR EVEN TAKE OTHER THINGS TO PREVENT THOSE FROM INCREASING THEN YOU CAN CERTAINLY UM BE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH T  YOU ERE FIDOCIA DOSING YOU CAN INCREASE IT QUITE A BIT AND IT HAS A DOSE DEPENDENT RESPONSE IN BOTH THE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIA WITH HYGHTESTOSTERONE AND ALSO JUST ELL ACHAND TESTOSTERONE SO THE UNA MORE AGGRESSIVE REGIMENT WOULD BE SIX HUNDRED MELEGRAMS DAILY FOR A MONTH AND THEN TAKE ONE TO TWO WEEKS OFF NITHING THAT'S MORE OR LESS WOULD I'VE BEEN DOING UM OK TERRIFIC IN TERMS OF OTHER HORMONES WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN SUPPORT GROWTH HORMONE I DO HORMON THE A SOCIY WITH TISSUE REPAIR AND SOME CASES METABOLISM IN FAT LOSS UM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TOOLS NUTRICIONAL AND OUR SUPPLEMENT BASED ONE CAN DO TO UM TAP ON THE A GROTHORMONE PATHWAY AND AND LET'S LUMP I G F ONE IN THEIRE TWO SINCE THERE RESSENTUALLY WORKING ALONG THE SAME DIMENSIONS A QUICONOPSIS GROWTHORMONE IS A PEPTITE HORMONE IND IT IS RELEASED BY THE PETUITARY THERE IS GROWTH HORMONE RELEASING HORMONE AND GRELLIN THAT STIMULATE THE RELEASE SO THERE'S ALSO PEPTIDES THAT OUR VERY ANALOGOUS TO THESE TWO THINGS YOU HAVE THAT PULSITILE SECRETION OF GROWTH HORMONE IN A VERY FAST HALF LIFE OF JUST MINUTES AND THEN IT INCREASES IGF ONE THERE IS BOTH PERIFERAL IGF ONE AND CENTRAL IGF ONE AND IG TWO BUT NO NEED TO GET INTO THE SPECIFICS THERE IS A HAPPY MEDIUM TO WER YOUR GROWTH HORMONE IS AT A ADEQUATE LEVEL AND YOUR IGF ONE IS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL USUALLY THOSE TWO R CON GRUENT SO IN MOST CASES WE JUST CHECK AN IGF ONE AND OCCASIONAL LY THE BINDING PAPTIDES FOR IG ONE KIND OF LIKE ESSE B G THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT A YOUR ESTIMATING A FREE IGF ONE IS IS KIND OF CONFUSING BECAUSE ALL HORMON ALMOST ALL HORMONES HAVE A BINDING PROTINES TO HELP REGULATE THEM BUT OFTEN YOU ONE A LOOK AT FREE TESTOSTERON FREE ESTERADI ALL FREE IGF ONDER AT LEAST ESTIMATID FREE CORTOSALL EVEN AND FREE THIROD HORMON BUT A WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GROWTH HORMONN IG F ONE USUALLY YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING TOP TO MISIT IF YOU ARE A DIABETIC THEN A DEPINION ON THE TYPODIBEDIES YOUR IG F ONE AND GROWTHORMONE CAN BE TOO HIGH SPECIFICALLY AND TYPE ONE DIBDES YOUR GROWTH HRMON IS EXTREMELY HIGH BUT YOUR IGF ONE IS LOW SO IF YOU ARE IN A DISREGULATED STATE OR HAVE PATHOLOGY I WOULD JUST TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT IG F ON OR GROWTH HORMON TAKING THING TAKING O MENO ACIDS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED COULD PETINTIALLY HELP WITH GROWTH HORMON RELEASE JUST BECAUSE A MOST GROWTHORMONE IS RELEASED WHILE YOU SLEEP I'VE HEARD THAT FASTING CAN INCREASE GROWTHHORMON AND I KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN PATTERNS OF WAIT TRAINING THAT CAN INCREASE GROWTHHORMON AS SOME OF THOSE REGIMENTS IN THE WAIT ROOM THAT INCREASE GROTHORMON HAVE BEEN COVERED BY AM DOCTOR DUNCAN FRENCH WHO IS A A ON A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST A'M SO MA WILL A REFER PEOPLE TO A THAT EPISODE FOR THE SPECIFIC PROTOCAULSE'S HIGH VOLUME TRAINING DURING THOSE TRAINING EXERCISES IT USUALLY DOES IT TRANSIENTLY FOR A PERIOD OF FEW HOURS AND IT AA LOT OF THIS IG FH ONE IS RELEASE BY THE MUSCLE ITSELF SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY REATHED BY THE LIVER IGF ONE THAT IS RELEASED DIRECTLY DUE TO GROWTH HORMON SIGNALING USUALLY THE GROWTH HORMON COMES FROM THE PETUITARY AND BINDS TO THE LIVER WHERE USUALLY HAS A HALF LIFE OF ABOUT A WEEK WHERE THE PERICRINER ATOCRAN THING OF IT AS LIKE THE PERIFERALLY ACTING OR ACTING IN THE MUSCLES ITSELF WHICH IS ALSO HELPFUL A IS RELEASED AND IS NOT AS CONCERNING BECAUSE IT'S NOT RELATED TO INSOLENT RESISTANCE A BUT IT IS RELATED TO THE TRAIN ITSELF SO FASTING AND GROWTH HORMNE AM IS IT TRUE THAT FASTING CAN INCREASE GROTHORMON AND MAYBE AS A LITTLE A RELATED TANGENT I'VE HEARD THAT LIMITING FOOD AND TAKE FOR THE TWO HOURS BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP CAN INCREASE THE PULSE OF GROWTHORMON THAT ONE EXPERIENCES DURING SLEEP COURSE EVERYONE GETS A PULSE OF GROTHORMON DURING SLEEP BUT I ESPECIALY CARBOHIDRATE LADEN MEALS CAN AM BLUNT THAT PEAK THAT OCCURS DURING SLEEP QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY SO TWO QUESTIONS AM TAS AVOITING FOOD IN TAKE IN THE TWO HOURS PRIOR TO SLEEP HELP INCREASE GROWTHORMON RELEASE MAYBE IT'S BEING OVERLY NAROTIC MAYBEOPEOPLE NEED TO AVOID FOOD IN THE FOUR HOURS BEFORE SLEEP BUT REGARDLESS WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FASTING IN GROWTHORMEN RELEASE I FIND THIS REALLY INTERESTING FASTING CERTAINLYP POTENTLY INCREASES GROWTHHORMON RELEASE HOWEVER THE IND BINDING TO THE RECEPTER IS LESS SENSITIVE SO ALTHOUGH FASTINE DOES INCREASE GROWTH HORMONE THE GENES THAT ARE DOWNSTREME TO IT BOTH THE GROWTHORMON GENES AND IGEOF ONE RELATED A GENE TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVITY WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HOWEVER IF YOU ARE OPTIMIZING THE GROWTH HORMONE THAT IS A RELEASED AS PULSITILE SECRETION IT IS HELPFUL TO AVOID EATING FOR TWO HOURS SO THAT GENERALOTHUM IS AVOID EATING ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE BED I THINK THAT'S CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND HELPFUL BUT FASTING OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY FOR GROWTHHORMONOPTIMIZATION AN SOME ONE WHO ALREADY HAS NORMAL GROWTHHORMON SIGNALLING IS NOT HELPFUL THAT'S EXTREMELY A USEFUL TO HEAR YOUSE ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY PEOPLE FAST AS GET THAT GROWTHORMORN IN GREASE BUT IF THERE A'M ADJUSTING THINGS ON THE BACK END THAT NEGATE THAT WELL THEN A NO SUCH LUCK A NOT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST FASTING I DO AS PSEUDO INTERMET IN FASTING MOST ECAUSE I PREFERTID FAIRLY REGULAR TIMES OF DAY O CASE OR DOES TELL ING THERE'S A LOT THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE IN SUPPLEMENT FORM TO IMPROVE GROWTHORMON WHAT ABOUT FIEROY TORMAN WHAT AR IT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE OR DO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR THIERAY TORMON LEVELS ARE APPROPRIATE YOU WOINL HAVE A BALANCE OF IODINE AND YOU WIL HAVE A GOOD SOURCE OF IDNE SO THERE'S SOME CAMPS THAT SAY YOU SHOULD USE A HUGE HIDOS OF IODINE AND THE CROTOCALLS FOR IT AND THERE'S SOME THAT SAY YOU SHOULD USE JUST BARELY ENOUGH IODINE I BELIEVES LIKE TOO HUNDRED MICROGRAMS PERDAY BUT YOU WANT A BALANCE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SEE THAT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT TALK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO IODN AND FHIROID IS THERE IS COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS GOEDEROGENS AR GOETROGENS AND THESE GOETROGENS ARE NITHER GOOD NOR EVIL BUT THERE ACTUALLY KIND OF A NICE CHECK AN BALANCE YOU NEED MORE IODINE IF YOU CONSUME MORE GOETROGENS AND SOME EXAMPLES OF THESE ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITE FROD FOODS CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES BORE ON IS ALSO A GOEUTROGEN SO HIGER GOETROGENS HIER ODIN SO IGGESTING IODINE CONTAINING SALT IS USEFUL YES OR NO IDIZED SALT DOES PREVENT GOITER BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE IDEAL FORM OF IODINE A GOOD FORMS OF IODINE OFTEN COME FROM THE OCEAN IF YOU LOOK AT A CHART OF HYPOFHIRADISM THERE IS A TENDENCY TO HAVE MORE HYPOFHIRAISM THE MORE ENDLAN YOU GO SO TRYING TO EAT SOME CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES EACH DAY WOULD BE THE BEST WATE IT IMPROVE IRATORM ALONG WITH PLENTY OF ODINE YOU DON'T WANT TOO MUCH IODINE SIGNALLING MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH RADIO ACTIVE IODINE TABLETS AND THAT'S BASICALLY AN EXTREMELY HIGH AMOUNT OF IDINE TO BLOCK OUT THE A LIKE THE RADIO ACTIVE IODINE THAT COMES FROM AFTER OF YOU KNOW LIKE A NUCLE MELT DOWN OR WHAT NOT SO WE'VE GOT CREATINE BEN EL CARNATINE WITH ALLISON GARLIC A TO OFFSET THE T ME O VIT HIM IND THREE BOR ON TONGALE FIDOGIA FASTING LOVE TO TALK YOU ABOUT PEPTIES SO I CAN IMAGINE A HIERACHY IRK STARTS WITH BEHAVIORS NW AND NUTRITIAN BEHAVERS OF COURSE INCLUDES TRAINING AND LIMITING STRESS AND ALL THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE SUNSHINE AT CETERA AND OPTIMIZE NUTRITION THEN WE TALKD ABUT SUPPLEMENTS ALL THE THINGS WE JUST LISTED OFF TWO OPTIMIZE TESTOSTERON END WE CAN GET INTO THIS BUT ESTERGEN AS WELL WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR LIBIDO AND BRAIN FUNCTION AND TISSUE FUNCTION AND  JOINT FEELING GOOD ET CETERA BUT THEN WE GET INTO THE REALM WHERE ONE BMIGHT OR COULD CONSIDER EXOCNIS HORMONS GET TAKING A SMALL DOSE OF TESTOSTRONE ARE TAKING A SMALL DOSE OF OF G H EVEN IF O IF THAT WERE APPROPRIATE AND CERTAINLY ONLY WORKING IF THE DOCTOR BUT IN BETWEEN THERE'S A STEP OF SO CALL PEPTIDES AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY PEPTIDES WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THEM BUT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TAKING PEPTIDES THE ONES THAT I HEAR MOST OFTEN ABOUT IS A A CATEGORY THAT INCREASES G H AND I G F ONE AND THOSE TO MY KNOWLEDGE GO BY THE INGS LIKE SIRMORELLAN I PROMORELLAN TESSAMORELLAN SOR OF A A KIT OF THINGS THAT IM TAKIN SEPARATELY OR OR IN COMMINATION TO INCREASE G H AND I G IF ONE BUT THEN OTHER PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE ARE TAKING PEPTIDES LIKE B P C ONE FIVE SEVEN TO TRYIN AIMPROVE TISSUE HEALING IN RECOVERY THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN PEPTIDES PLEASE IF YOU WOULD TELL US ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE SAFETY OF PEPTIDES AND TERIMS OF THEIR SOURCING AND THE UTILITY OF PEPTIDES YOU KNOWRESIST SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD CONSIDER  BEFORE THINKIG ABOUT HORMON REPLACEMEN SHOULD PEOPLE BE WEARY OF THESE THINGS I AM VERY WEARY OF PARTICULAR SOURCES THAT ARE SOLD ON LINE THAT ARE NOT CLEAN THEY CONTAIN CONTAMINANTE AND THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS I REALLY WE LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON PEPTIDES I MUS GOING TO SIP BACK AND LET YOU RIF ON PEPTIDES BUT IF YOU COULD TOUCH ON SOME OF THE ONES THAT I MENTION A BE MOST GRATEFUL A PEPTIDE IS JUST A CHAIN OF AMINO ASCITS BETWEEN TWO AND A COUPLE HUNDRED IN LENGTH SO I THINK OF PEPTIDES AS SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND THE G H RPS THAT YOU MENTIONED I WOULD CONSIDER THOSE ATHET STANDS FOR GROWTH HORMON RELEASING PEPTIDE YOU HAVE TWO MAN TIPES THE GRELLAN AGONIST THAT OR THEY HIT THE GRELLAN RECEPTOR AND THO AT AT HELPS RELEASE GROWTH HORMONE BECAUSE OF THATS AND THEN ALSO T A G H OR H LIKE PEPTIDES SO THEIRE VERY SIMILAR TO GROWTH HORMON RELEASING HORMON OFTEN THEY JUST CHANGE A COUPLE O MINO ACIDES AND IT ACTS LIKE THAT TESAMORLAN IS ONE OF THEM SIR MORLAN IS ANOTHER ONE AND C G C IS ANOTHER COMMON ONE I BELIEVE THOSE ARE ALL IN THE CLASS OF G H OR H LIKE PEPTIDES WHEREAS HYPOMORELLAN OR I BAUTA MORRAN WHICH IS ALSO NAN AS IN CASE SIX SEVEN SEVEN THOSE TWO ARE IN THE CLASS OF GRALAN AGANISTS OTHER MORE LIKE A THEY HIT THE RECEPTOR THAT GRELLAN DOES ERES THE OTHER ONES HIT T G H OR H FOR CEPTR I THINK OF GRELLAN IS MAKING ME HUNGRY HUNGRY AND ANGRY WHY WOULD I WANT TO TAKE SOMETHING THATWOULD INCREASE GRELLANER SIGNALLING SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GANEWAIT IT ALSO DOES INCREASE YOUR GROWTH HORMON SO IFIOUR GROWTH HORMAN IS VERY LOW YOU CAN CONSIDERIT I BAUTAMORAN IS A LONG ACTING SO AS A LONG HALF LIFE ALSO N AS IN CASE SI SEVEN SEVEN IT WAS WELL IT WAS STUDIED MOSTLY IN GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY AND DO THESE PEOPLE GET ANGRY ALSO THEY CAN MANY PEOPLE REPORT A SIDE EFFECT OF ANXIETY OR SIGNIFICANT HUNGER A MOST PEOPLE TAKE IT IN THE EVENING SO THEY DON'T NOTICE THAT HUNGER AS MUCH IT CAN ALSO GREATLY NCREASE YOUR BLOOD GLUE COASTS SO IF YOUR INSOLENT RESISTANT OR CREDIABETIC GETS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RAREMOMENTS WHERE I HEAR SOMETHING AND I THEY AND I THINK OCAY EVEN THOUGH THEREIS THIS A KIT OF COMPOUNDS THAT CAN INCREASED I H AND IG IF ONE BASED ON EVERYTHING YOUARE TELLING ME MAYBE JUST TAKING G H IS THE BETTER OPTION FOR THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE GROWTH HARMON AT LEAST IT'S SYNTHATIC GROWTHARMON IS MIMICING AND INDOGEN IS HORMONE MAY NOT I CERTAINLY NOT TAKING ANYTHING MIGHT BE THE IDEAL BUT FOR THOSE THAT ONE INCREASE GROWTH HARMON AN THE ONT USED FARMACOLOGY TO DO THAT SOMETHING THESE PEPTIDES ARE PRETTY PRECARIOUS YEI CANNOT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION IF THERE'S A AN INDIVIDUAL THAT A STRUGGLES WITH HUNGER AND NOT EATING ENOUGH FOR EXAMPLE A YOU KNOW SOME ONE WHO HAS A VERY SMALL STOMACH OR THEY JUST A HAVE A VERY LOW HUNGER DRIVE SOMETIMES YOU WANT MORE OF THAT EREXIGENIC SIGNALING THE HYPOTHALYMUS YOU HAVE ANEREXIGENTIC SIGNALING WHICH HAS COME LIKE ANEREXIA AND EREXIGENIC SIGNALING WHICH IS I CALL IT HANGRY CENTER OF THE A HYPOTHALYMUS OR THE  HANGRY SENTER AND IF THERE'S IT IN BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THAN A PERHAPS I'D BE HELPFUL BITENTUALLY THEORETICALLY HELPFUL IN ANEREC IX OF WHICH A THE INCIDENTS OF ANEREXYAT MEN IS INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY AS YOU TELL ME THIS I'M REMEMBERING BEING FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND I WOULD GO INTO THE KITCHEN SOMETIMES AND I WAS SO HUNGRY I WAS JUST OBLITERATE ALL THE FOOD AND I DO REMEMBER BE VAYS BEEN PERY HIGH ENERGY GI BUT HAVING IMMENSE AMOUNT OF ENERGENERAL CAN'T RECAL IF IT WAS A HANGRY FEELING OR NOT BY GESSING THTASE GROWTH HARMON I GREW ONE FOOT IN A SINGLE ACADEMIC YEAR SO IMAGINE I WAS AT LEAST IN PART DO TO GROWTH HARMONE A IN ANY CASE AM SURMERELLAN IS IS THE PEPTIE THAT I HERE MOST OFTEN ABOUT A I IT MAYLY TRY O RONOVIT AS RESEARCHING A BOOK A AND DECIDE TO TAKE IT BEFORE SLEEP ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IT GAVE ME A TREMENDOUS A DEPTH OF SLEEP BUT THAT SLEEP WAS REALLY TRUNCATED WHICH IS IS NER ED SPEAK FOR SAYING DEEP BUT SHORT SLEEP IUUD WAKE UP AFTER VERY INTENSE DREAMS I CAN'T SAY THAT HELP ME RECOVER FROM EXERCISE THAT MUCH I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY ADITIONAL FAT LOSS OR ANYTHING SO OF ABANDON IT IT'S THET FOR OCCASIONAL USE AGAIN THIS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR IM YOU KNOW I BAS TRYING TO GET THE SENSE OF THESE THESE PEPTIDES IN THEIR EFFECTS ARE A SOMEWHAT VAGUE AND DISTRIBUTED AND HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL IS THAT OF FAIR WOODED TO DESCRIBE THEM PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE EFFECTS OF PEPTIDES IS MANY PEOPLE TAKE THEM IN LEVELS THAT ARE FAR ABOVE THE PHYSIOLOGIC RANGE EVEN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CHECKING THEIR IGF ONE WHILE THEY TAKE AM THESE DIFFERENT G H AR PEAS MOST OF THEM DO NOT CHECK  TE BINING PEPTIDES FOR EXAMPLE IG  FINDING PEPTITE ONE TWO OR THREE AND IM THEI'RE FREE IG F ONE LEVEL MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT SO THE A A COMMON DOSE IS THAT PEOPLE WELL TAKE THESE OFF LABEL FOR AS A SUPPLEMENT ARE OFTEN MUCH GREATER THANY THEIR PUTIC OR PHYSIOLOGIC RANGE WHICH FOR ME JUS UNDER SCORSE O ACT THAT IT'S PRETTY PRECARIOUS OMMIN NO I'M NOT COMING IN HERE IS THE REFERY OF WHAT ANYONE SHOULD ER SHOULDN'T DO IM STRANAT A GATHERIN DISTRIBUTE INFORMATION BUT IT I'VE HEARD FOR INSETANCE THAT SOME OF COMPANIES WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACQUIRE THESE THINGS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION THEY THOSE COMPANIES ARE NOT GOOD AT CLEANING OUT THE ITHE LIPPY POLLY SACRIE THE OLL PS WHICH CAN CAUSIN IN FLAMMATORY RESPONSE OTHERWORDS THESE ARE DIRTY COMPOUNDS IM AND THATS JUST SOUNDS RISKY IT JUST SOUNDS FRANKLY IT JUST SOUNDS REALLY DANGEROUS TO ME E PS IS A COMMON ATITIVE IN MANY COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT PHARMACIES BUT THERE SELLING THINGS THAT PEOPLE OFTEN USE AS HUMAN CONSUMPTION ONE INTERESTING NOTE ABOUT WIPEL POLLY SACKWRITE AS YOUR A GOT MYCROPILE MAXUALLYT MAKES LOT OF OF IT AS WELL ESPECIALLY PREVATELLA WHICH IS A SPECIFIC SPECIES THAT CAN HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR BASE LINED BODY TEMPERATURE SO YOU'R BASELINED BODY TEMPERATURE MIGHT ALSO CHANGE DEPINION ON IF YOU'RE ON A PEPTITE THAT HAS E PCIN YIKES YIKES AND YIKES BUT I TEND TO BE PRETTY CONSERVATIVE IM WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING ANYTHING EXOGINOUS BUT I DO RELY ON A MANY THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND IGHT DO TRY ND OPTIMIZE THE BEHAVIORAL THINGS AND NUTRITIONAL THINGS AF FOR A LONG TIME BO CASE SO THEN IM LEAVING PEPTIDES BEHIND AM WE ARE NOW I SUPPOSEIN THE TERRITORY OF EXOGOS WORMON SO LET'S SAY THAT SOMEBODY DESIDES THEY'RE NOT CONCERND WITH FERTILITY OR THEY'RE GOING TO BANK SPERM OR THEY ALREADY HAVE KIDS OR THEY'RE GOING TO DEFER ON THIS ISSUE OF WONTIG HAVE KIDS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NOWADAYS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USING TO STOSTEROWN LET'S NOT EVEN CALLIT REPLACEMENT TERRI BECAUSE SOME OF TESE PEOPLE HAVE SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED OR EVEN YOU KNOW EIGHT HUNDRED ANGRAM PRE DEST THE LEADER READS SO THEY'RE NOT REPLACING ANYTHING THAT IS DIMINISH TEY'RE JUST TRYING TO AUGMENT WHAT'S ALREADY THEIR INCREASE WAS ALREADY THERE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TAKING G A LOW DOSE MORE FREQUENTLY IS GOING TO BE MORE BENEFICIAL THAN THAT AND OF OLD SCHOOL WAY OF GIVING YOU KNOW A HUNDRED OR EVEN TWO HUNDRED MELEGRAMS IN A SINGLE INJACTION ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS IS THAT RIGHT AND AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH YOUR PATIENT SO LET ME GIV YOUR HYPOTHETICAL SOMEBODY COMES INTO YOUR OFFICE THEY AM YOU THEIR BLOOD WORK AN THEY HAVE AM BLOOD LEVELS OF LETS SAY SIX HUNDRED ANIGRAMS PERDESOLIER ESTSTERONE THEIR STROGEN IS ALSO IN NORMAL RANGE EVERYTHING ELSE CHECKS OUT BUT THEIR COMPLAINING OF YOU KNOW SLIGHTLY DIMINISH LOBIDO SLIGHTLY POOR RECOVERY FROM WORK OUTS MAY BE IM YOU KNOW REDUCE A MOTIVATION IN DRIVE ALTHOUGH NO MAJOUR DEPRESSION AND YOU COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT TESTOSTERON THERAPY NOT REPLACEMEN BUT TESTOSTERON THEREA BE MIGHT BE A GOOD OPTION TO EXPLORE WHAT'S A TYPICAL DOSAGE OF RANGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION RANGE THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER EXPLORING AND SOME OF THIS DEPENDS ON THE S H B G AND FREE TESTOSTROM AS WELL SO IF THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL HAD A VERY HIGH S H B G WHICH AGAIN IS THE BINDING PROTINE THAT BINDS UP THE TESTOSTERONE AND ALL ANDRGENS AND ESTROGENS IF IT IS EXTREMELY HIGH AND THEY HAVE A FREE TESTOSTERONE OF TWO THEN THEY MIGHT NEED A DIFFERENT DOSE BECAUSE THEY NEED ENOUGH TESTOSTERONE IN ORDER TO A HAVE A NORMAL U GANATLE FREE TOSTOSTERONE BUT A GENERAL NORMAL DOSN RANGE ESPECIALLY FOR SOME ONE STARTING IS AROUND ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRE TWENTY MELEGRAMS DIVIDED OVER THE COURSE OF A WEEK USUALLY EITHER EVERY OTHER DAY OR THREE TIMES A WEEK OCCASIONALLY TWICE A WEEK MANY PEOPLE WITH S H B G A BIT HIGHER CAN GET AWAY PRETTY EASILY WITH TWICE A WEEK THIS IS ASSUMING THAT THE STER ISSIPIENATE OR ANANTATE SO TO SIXTY MELEGRAM EJECTIONS OF TESTOSTERO SIPBE T PER WEEK Y VERY COMMON DOSING TO HIT THAT HUNDRED AND TWENTY MLEGRAMS PER WEEK AS KIND OF THE TYPICAL AVERAGE RRECT AND I WOULD CONSIDER THIS I MA LIKE A PHYSIOLOGIC YOU GANATLTOSE FOR MANY PEOPLE EVEN TWO HUNDRED MELEGRAMS A WEEK TIS FAR ABOVE THE REFERENCE RANGE ALL OF THIS IS SAID WITH THE CAVIOT THAT TESTOSTERON IS ANOTH NORMALLY RELEASED IN A PULSITILE MANNER SO IT'S HIGH IN THE MORNING LOW IN THE EVENING WHEREAS IF YOU'RE ON A TESTOSTERON THERAPY THEN A YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A STEADY STATE SO YOU'RE TESTOSTERO LEVELS GAN TO BE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EVEN IN THE EVENING AND IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHEN PATIENTS DO THAT THEY I'M GUESSING THEIR REPORT THE NORMAL CONSELATION OF POSIVE EFFACTS YOU NAR IMPROVE MOD IMPROVED ENERGY IMPRUESLEE AN RECOVERY ET CETERA  WHAT IRE SOME OF THE HAZARDS OR THINGS THAT I'M CAN CROP UP IN BLOOD WORK OR JUST SUBJECTIVELY THAT IM CAN BE WARNING SIGNS THAT EVEN A DOSAGE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MELEGRAMS DIVIDED INTO THESE TWO OR THREE DOSAGES PER WEEK IS TOO HIGH EVERY ORGAN SYSTEM IN THE BODY SO THIS IS WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE A AT LEAST WELL VERSED IN EVERY ORGAN SYSTEM NOT JUST TH GANATLE AM LIKE YOU KNOW GENITAL SYSTEM YOUD HAVE A YOU KNOW DERM MOTOLOG PROWESS ACHNY IS VERY COMMON CHANGE LOTS OF DIFFERENT A SKIN PATHOLOGIES OR EVEN BRUISING CAN BE RELATED TO HORMONORPLACEMENT HARLOSS IS VERY COMMON TO SE AS WELL A MENTAL STATUSCHANGES IT COULD OCCASIONALLY IT EVEN INDUCES A MANIC OR A BIPOLER EPISODE BECAUSE TESTOSTERON IS ALSO DUPOMONURGIC AND THEN CARTY OF ASCULARLY NOT JUST IN THE HEART BUT ALSO CONCERNS FOR LIKE MICROFASCULAR ASCHEMIC DISEASE PERITSON BUILT UP BECAUSE THE ASTROGEN ALSO INCREASES AND THEN A FERTILITY CONCERNS AS WELL AND LIPID CONCERNS TO SEVERELY HAVE TO BE NO HEMOTOLOGIST ERMOTOLOGIST CARTIOLOGIST A A LIPIDOLOGIST THE WHOLE NINEYARDS SO ANOTHER REASON OR SET OF REASONS RATHER TO A IF ONE IS CONSIDERING USING TESTOSTRN THERAPY TO REALLY DO THIS IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH A REALLY GOOD PHYSICIAN THAT'S A LOT TO MONITOR KNOWING WHETHER NO YOF ACTING OR NOT AS ONE THING BUT KNOWING WHETHER NOT YOUR ELDY ELIS GOING UP YOUR AP BE IS GOING UP THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER BUSI AND THAN HES TO BE DONE THROUGH BLOODWORK IS WHAT I'M HERE CORRECT AND IF YOUR PHYSICIAN THAT IS MANAGING OR PESCRIBING YOUR A TESTOSTRON THERAPY OR YOUR H R T IS NOT WELL VERSED IN THESE SYSTEMS YOU WOULD WANT HIMER HER TO BE PART OF AN INTER DISCIPLINARY TEAM WHERE THEY HAVE OTHER EXPERTS THAT CAN MONITER THOSE SYSTEMS I SKIPPED OVER A SORT OF STILL INTERMEDIATE SET OF THINGS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT MAYBE TALKING BOUT TESTOSTRON FIRST WAS A BIT OF A MISTAKE ON MY PART BECAUSE I'M AWARE THAT THERE I SHOULD THINK THER COMPANIES BUT CERTAINLY GROUPS OUT THERE THAT SAY NO WAT DON'T GO STRAIGHT FROM NOTHING TO SUPPLEMENTS TO TESTOSTRON ONCE YOUR DOING A BEHAVIORS AND OPTIMIZING NUTRICIAN SUPPLEMENTS  LET'S FORGET PEPTIDES INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO TESTOSTRON THERAPY ONE IDEA THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE PURSUING IS TO I'M TAKE THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT TRIGGER LUTINIZING HORMONES O TAKE TAKING H C G HUMAN CRONIC CANATATROPIN WHICH MY UNDERSTANDING AS WILL INCREASE TESTOSTROM BUT ALSO ESTEROGEN WHERE THEY'LL TAKE THINGS LIKE CLOMAPHIN A'M IN FACT I THINK THERE ARE BUNCH AT COMPANIES OUT THERE NOW THERE I'M SAYING DON'T TAKE TESTOTRON IT SHUTS DOWNSPEROMATAGES IS SHUTS DOWN A TESTOSTROM PRODUCTION CLOMOPHIN IS THE WAY TO GO I'M MAYBE COULD EDUCATE US ABOUT THE H H C G MONOTHERAPY I THINK IT'S CALLED WHERE YOURE JUSTMONO ONE JUST TAKING  C G AND CLOMAPHIN AS A IM AND OR CLOMAPHIN AS A TOOL TO A RACHED UP HORMONS SO QUICK POINTS ON H C G HUMAN CORYONIC CANNOT TROPIN A MAD DEARING ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANC IT HAS EFFECTS OTHER THAN BINING TO THE ELE RECEPTOR IT ALSO BINDS TO THE T C H RECEPTER IN THE THIROID IT SIROD STIMULATING HORMA YES IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT A MOLECULE OF H C G AND THIROY STIMULATING HORMONE THEY ARE EXTREMELY SIMILAR HOWEVER YOU NEED A RELATIVELY HIGH DOSE OF H C G TO BINDTO THE T   TROC FTER THIS IS THE NORMAL MECHANISM AND PREGNANCY THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE INCREASED NEED OF FYROD HORMO USUALLY ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY PERSENT SO THAT'S WHY IF SOMEONE HAS HYPOTHORANISM YOU TO INCREASE THIRDOS O PHYROID BECAUSE THE TC GS NOT GOING TO BE DOING TO FOR YOU A THE CLOMED OR CLOMAPHIN THERE'S TOO MAIN A I BELIEVE IT'S DISTERIO ISEMERS AND ONE OF THEM IS INCLOMAPHAN ONE OF THE MEZU CLOMOPHAN  THESE TWO WORK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY A INCLOMOPHAN I BELIEVE HAS A FASTER HALF LIFE AND IT IS A POTENTIALLY SLIGHTLY BETTER TOLERATED HOWEVER THEY WERE STUDYING IT A YOU KNOW CLOMET IS A VERY COMMONLY PRESCRIBE DRUG AND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS PLENTY OF IN CLOMYPHAN IN A CLOMED HOWEVER THE DRUG WHICH WAS ANDRESOL A ENDIORO EX HAEL A DID NOT GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FT APPROVAL PROCESS DESPITE CLOMAD BING F T IT PROVED CASE OTHERE'S CLOMAD WHICH CONTAINS CLOMAPIN BUT THERE ALSO BECAUSE WE TRING MY MEN HORM MALHORMON OPTIMIZATION THIS EPISODE THERE ARE MAILS OUT THERE WHO WANT T INCREASE THEIR TESTOSTERON AND OTHER HORMONS MABE GROTHORMON ET CETERA WHO OPTIN NOT TAKE EXOGEIS TUS TOSTRONS A NO CREAM NO PELLIT NO NO AM ILL NO INJECTABLE SIPIENA BUT DECIDE TO TAKE CLMOPHIN A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK MY UNDERSTANDING HAVE NEVER DONE THIS I WOULD SAY IF I HAD MYUNDERSTANDING IS THAT TAKING CLOMAPHIN MAYBE TWO FIFTY MILOGRAM TALET'S A WEEK IS WHAT I HEAR PEOPLE ARE DOING WILL INCREASE WHAT LUTINIZING HORMON THE VERIOUS ESTEROGEN RECEPTOR SUBUNITS COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW CLOMAPHIN WOULD BENEFIT ANYONE AND IS THIS A GOOD STRATEGY I A'M HEARING THAT IT'S BEEN DONE QUITE A LOT NOW IT WILL INCREASE TOSTOSTERON IN A DOSE DEPENDENT MANNER BUT IT HAS MANY OTHER PHARMOCODYNAMIC EFFECTS WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF THE DRUG ON THE BODY OTHER THAN ITS EFFECT ON THE HYPOTHALEMUS IN THE PATUITRY SO IN THE HYPOTHALYMIS IN THE PATUITARY IT A DOES WHAT'S CALLED NEGATIVE FEED BACK IN HABITION A OR IT IT BELOCKS THE AXTION OF ESTROGEN SO IT CROWDS OUT ESTROGEN FROM THE ESTROGEN RECEPTER ON THE HYPOTHALAMUS IN THE PATUITARY AND WHAT'S THIS OBJECTIVE EFFECT THAT THAT WOULD CAUSE SOD  MY UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE OF ESTEROGEN IS TIT A IF I EVER TOOK AND I DID TAKE A VERY LOW DOSE OF AN AROM AN TAKESIN HIMITOR ONCE ANDI FELT TERRIBLE ASHE REDUCE LEBIDO JOINTS FELL ACHY THAT'S WHEN I DISCOVER THAT WHILE ESTERGEN IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOUR BRAIN FUNCTION FOR JOINT FUNCTION AND FOR LEBIDO AND SUPPRESSING ESTEROGEN FOR ME TURN JUST TURNED OUT TO BE THE THE WRONG IDEA BUT MY LEVELS INDICATE THAT IT'S WITHIN REFERENCE RANGE O K SO WHY WOULD I WANT TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF AN ESTROGEN RECEPTER I JUST CAN'T FIND THE RATIONEL FOR THAT THE MAIN RATIONAL BEHIND TAKING A SERM IS AS A VERY TEMPORARY MEASURE THAT IS NOT GOING TO SU PRESS PETUITARY OR HYPOTHLEMIC FUNCTION IF YOU WERE TESTOSTRONE IS JUST SO DRASTICALLY LOW THAT IT IS UNLIKELY TO RECOVER ANYWA ANYWAY SO MOST OF THE TIME IT IS NOT CLINICALLY USEFUL IN M SERM SHOULD NOT BE PRESCRIBED VERY OFTEN CERTAINLY NOT AS LONG TERM TESTOSTERN REPLACEMENT IM ORTESTOSTRN OPTIMIZATION IN MOST INDIVIDUALS HERE'S ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS TO EVERYTHING BUT  THERE'S FIVE DIFFERENT ESTROGEN AND ESTROGEN RELATED RECEPTORS THERE'S TOO MAN ESTROGEN RECEPTORS IN CLOMED AND EVERY SERM HAS A VERY UNIQUE PROFILE BECAUSE THEY SELECTIVELY INHIBIT SOME RECEPTORS AND SOME TISSUES BUT NOT OTHER RECEPTORS AND OTHER TISSUES FOR EXAMPLE AM CLOMED CAN INHIBIT RECEPTORS THAT ARE ANY I AND IT CAN CAUSE AM VISUAL CHANGES BLITERY VISION IM ESPECIALLY AT HIGHER DOSES AND IT ALSO ACTS IN EVERY OTHER TISSUE THE BODY SO SITE EFFECTS FROM CLOMEDAND OTHER  SELECTIVE ESTROGEN RECEPTR MODIFIERS ARE VERY COMMON I'M AT LEAST BY MY MIND I'M GOING TO PPOOL HEM WITH BEPTIDES AND SAY IT SOUNDS PRECARIOUS AND AM PROBABLY NOT IDEAL FOR MOST PEOPLE AM GOING BACK TO TESTOSTERON THERAPY THAN A NOTICE FOLKS HAVE DELEADED THE REPLACEMENT PART BECAUSE I THINK SO MANY PEOPLE ARE USING TETOSTERON THERAPY WITHOUT THE NEED TO THE SORT OF REFERENCE RANGE NEED TO AUM TO REPLACE ANYTHING BUT RATHER BUILDING ON WHAT THEY ALREADY HAVE FOR PURPOSES OF INCREASING VITALITY ET CETERA GOING BACK TO THAT A MINORSTANDING IS THAT TAKING H C G IA SEVERAL TIMES FOR WEEK CAN HELP MAINTAIN SPERMAD GENICISM FERTILITY EVEN WHILE PEOPLE ARE ON TESTOSTERON BUT AND YOU NOW RE TOIK ABOUT THE SEARLIER THAT THERE'S TREMENDOUS VARIATION SOME PEOPLE WELL TAKE A SMALL AMOUNT TOSTOSTERONE AND JUST CRUSH THEIR SPERM CCOUNT THEY JUST WON'T MAKE ANY VIABLE SPERM OTHER PEOPLE CAN MAINTAIN VIABLE SPERM PRODUCTION WHILE ON TESTOSTERONE ESPECIALYIF THEIR TACHING TAKING H C G IS THAT RIGHT CORRECT AND THERE'S MANY REASONS FOR THIS SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH HEAT DAMAGE TO THE TESTES SUPETENTIALLY COLT THERE BE COULD BE HELPFUL FOR THAT AM A ICE HAS COLCIOURS WE'RE JUST A AND CERTAINLY AVOIDING MOST SONA OYE YEYE M STOPPING THE DAILY HOTTUB CAN RESTORE FERTILITY AND MANY PEOPLE I KNOW A NUMBER A PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN THAT GO INTO THE SONA AND THOSE PUT A COLD PACK IN THEIR SHORTS OR BETWEEN THEIR LEGS DEPENDING ONE ANOTHER WERING SHORTS ARE NOT LAM WHERE THEY'LL ALTERNATE ICE IN HEAT IN A WAY THAT MAINTAINS IM COOLNESS OF THE E  MILIEU IN WHICH THE THE SPERM LIVE OTHER WORDS IM THEI'RE COOLING IM THERE SCRODUM A DELIBERATELY IN ORDER TO AVOID KILLING THE SPERM ACHES ON INTERESTING PAPER A THAT SAID THAT FOR EVERY TWO DEGREE INCREASE IN IM A TEMPERATURE IOF THE SCRODUM THERE'S A TWENTY PER CE N DECREASE IN IN SPERMATIGENISIS AND A AN VIABILITY OF SPERM AND THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO STAND A LOT SITA LOT AND DRIVE A LOT WHAT YOU SEE IS A PROGRESSIVE DECREASE IN SPERM COUNTLHEY BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SIT SITTING THERE'S AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE SITTING ON THE HOT SEAT OF THE CAR THERE'S AN AM OR USING THE THE HEATED SEATS ASHE KILL SPERM INTHER GOOD DATA ON THAT YE EXCELLENT DATA AN ANECDOTE SIT AS WELL I'VE HAD SEVERAL PATIENTS COME IN FOR FERTILITY CONSULTATIONS AND ALL WE DO IS LIKE YOU KNOW NO MEDICATIONS NO SUPPLEMENTS WE CHANGE THE'RE LIKE SEVERAL LIFESTYLE THINGS A AN TIGHT FIT VERY TIGHT FITTING CLOTHING IS ANOTHER ONE AND SOON THEY HAVE FERTILITY AND A THEY'RE NO LONGER THEY THEY HAVE SPER WHEREAS BEFORE THEY DID NOT INTERESTING AM LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DUWS AND DON'TS BUT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF DUSE THINGS TAT ONE CAN DO TO OPTIMIE SWORMONTS MAYBE WE COUL JUST DU A SORT OF UM MORE RAPID FIRE A CU AND E ON SOME OF THE DON'TS M AND MAYBE THROWIN SOME SCIENCE A WHERE YOU FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE AM CANABUS MAROWINA T H C YES OR NO IT DIMINISHES TESTOSTRON LEVELS SMOKED CANABAS I WOULD SAY DIMINISHES TOSTOSTRON INCREASES PROLOCTON THAT'S A NO OTHER CANABINOIDS NOT PARTICULARLY HARMFUL SO C B D A C BD NOT PARTICULARLY HARMFUL SMOKED C B D I'M NOT SURE WHAT ABOUT EDABLE CANABAS IN T H CY AS FAR AS I KNOW EDIBLE CANABUS AND T H  DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE PROLOCHTON TO A POINT WHERE IT WOULD BE A DESTRUPTIVE OF HORMONCS CAN MAROINA T H C CANABUS WHEN EVERY ONE CALL IT INCREASE GANACAMASTY OF THE GROWTH OF MAL BREAST TISSUE YES IT'S CERTAINLY CAN AND THERE'S A A PRETTY GOOD ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SMOKED T H C AND GANICAMASTIA WHAT ABOUT A NICCOTINE AND TESTOSTRON AND ESTEROGEN ANOTHER HARMONES SMOKED NICCOTINE NICOTINE IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING NOT ONLY FOR TOSTOSTROM BUT ALSO FOR ESTROGEN PART OF IT IS IF OU'RE TALKING ABOUT NICOTINE FROM TOBACCO THERE'S MANY OTHER CARCINIGENS IN IT ESPECIALLY IF IT SMOKED BUT NICOTINE EVEN IF IT IS THUED IN A DOSE DEPENDENT MANNER SO I YOU CAN USE AN EXTREMELY SMALL AMOUNT OF NICCOTINE THEN IT'S NOT AS CONCERNING IN A LONGRON BUT IT'S AVASO CONSTRUCTOR AND AM ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS WITH IT WOULD BE A CARTY OF ASCULAR DISEASE OR EVEN A MICROW F ASCULAR ESCHEMIC DISEASE THAT CAN LEAD TENARRO TE GENERA TIPTASIES SELECT A TYPODOMINSHA THAT CAN BE PARTLY DU TO NICOTINE IF YOU USE NICOTINE FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME ESPECIALLY AT A HIRE DOSE IT'S A DOSE DEPENDENT EFFECT ON YOUR HORMON PROFILE IS TAT ALSO TRUE FOR NICERET AND NICOTINE OTHER NICKER NICOTINE GUMS AT HY DOSES IF YOU CAN USE AN EXTREMELY LOW DOSE OF A NICOTINE GUM THEN THEORETICALLY THAT WOULD BE A YOU KNOW MAINTAINABLE IT'S NOCK IN A OVERLOAD THE NICOTENIC RECEPTER YOU HAVE ASEETAL COALING AND THE COLINAGIC SYSTEM AS ONE OF YOUR A YOU KNOW MAY NERVOUS SYSTEMS OF COURSE AND YU HAVE MUSCARENIC RECEPTORS IN NICOTINE RECEPTORS AND THERE'S JUST BETTER WAYS TO OPTIMIZE YOUR NICOTENIC RECEPTOUR ACTIVITY FOR EXAMPLE OSEEDAL COALING PECURSURES LIKE ALPHIG P C POSOSITAL CEERING POSISITAL COALING A WEAK ESEDAL COLONESTRES AND HEBITERS ESPECIALLY NATURAL ONE'S POTENTUALLY HAVE A A LIKE APHART AS WELL AND THEN OTHER ALKALOIDS SO NICOTINE IS AN ALKALOID FROM THE TOBACCO PLANT THERE IS OTHER PLANTS LIKE CITOCINE AND THE A THAT GENUS OF PLANTS AND THAT ALKALOID IS ALSO A NICOTINE RECEPTER ACNIST AM IS IT TRUE THAT CYCLING FOR TOO LONG LITERALLY BICYCLING SITTING ON A A BICY TOO LONG CAN DAMAGE THE PROSTATE YES IT CAN BE VERY CONCERNING ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SEDED WHILE CYCLING ESPECIAY IF YOUR PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE PARANEUM YOUR A CORUS KINDI LIKE A BOX WHERE YOUR DIAPHRAM SORT OF MAKES THE TOP AND YOUR ABSENSERATUS MAKE THE FRONT IN THE SIDES YOUR BACK MUSCLES MAKE THE BACK AND THEN YOUR PELVIC FLOOR MAKES THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX WHICH IS ARGUABLY TEMOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR CORE AND THAT PRESSURE CAN WEAKEN AND EVENLY TIN CONTINENTS AND A IMPOTENS SO WE ARE TALKING EARLY TODAY IN THE GIM ABOUT HOW A HEAVY LEGWORK HACQUATS DEAD LIFTS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS E LOTIGIVES ARE DOING TO INCREASE THEIR TESTOSTRONE DONE CORRECTLY CAN ACTUALLY AUGMENT AND BUILD UP THE STRENGTH OF THE PALVIC FLOOR DONE INCORRECTLY CAN ACTUALLY WEAKEN THE PALVIC FLOOR AND LEADS ALL SORTS OF ISSUES INCLUDING SEXUAL FACTS NEGATIVE SEXUAL FACTS SO A HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT LEARNING WHETHER OR NOT THEIR MOVEMENTS ARE BEING DONE PROPERLY TO SUPPORT PALVIC FLOOR OR TO DISTRUCT PALVIC FLOOR A THE PELVIC FLOOR IS A CONSELLATION OF MUSCLES JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CONLICE SYSTEM IN THE BODY AND A YOU KNOW FOR IS IMPORTANT IF YOURE DOING DEVALSALVA MANEUVER WHICH AGAIN IS THAT A YOU CAN OF LIKE BEARING DOWN OR DEEP BREATH WHERE YOU FEEL ALL OF YOUR ABSORTYTE YOU CAN ALSO NOTICE THAT YOUR PALVIC FLOOR IS TIGHT AS WELL IF YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF A AAN INGUINAL HERNIA WHICH IS A WHOLE  KIND OF LIE CONNECTING THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY DOWN THROUGH THE PALVIC FLOOR EVEN THE SCRODUM IN SOME CASES IN THAT CAN BE A A SIGN THAT A THERE IS WEAKNESS IN THAT AREA AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CONCENTRATED ON IT MOST OR EVEN HEAVY PHYSIOTHERAPIST OR A PHYSICAL THERAPIST SPECIFICALLY TARGET THE PELVIC FLOOR MANY EXERCISES IN WHICH YOU VALSALVA OR USE YOUR A GLUTES OR LEGS YOU CAN LEARN TO SQUEEZE THEM AND HAVE THAT MINE MUSCLE CONNECTION IN ORDERS TO HELP BUILD UP THE PALVIC FLOOR AND THERE'S OTHER THINGS  MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH KEYGLES THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY DIFFERENT EXERCISES THAT CAN HELP YOUR PELVIC FLOOR MI UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHILE STRANTHING THE PELVIC FLOOR IS GOOD EXCESSIVE CONTRACTION OF THE PALVIC FLOOR CAN ACTUALLY LIMIT BLOOD FLOW TO THE PALVIC AREA THE PENIS AND SO FORTH SO IS IS AGAIN IT'S A DOUBLE AD SORD RIGHT IM MAN YOU DON'T WANT GIES OUT THERE TO JUSTART DOING ENDLESS NUMBER OF KEYGLES EVERY DAY BECAUSE THEIRE ACHICG IN A CONSTRICT BLOOD FLOW TO THAT AREA RIGHT THERE'S A AND IN FACT THE THE ERECTION RESPONSE IS PARO PAR SYMPATHETIC IT'S A RELAXED INDUCED RESPONSE RIGHT CRT SO YOU KNOW IFOR THE THE REASON I CHUCKLE AS IT YOU KNOW IT FOR CAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS WE DON'T HAVE VISUALES OR CHARTS AND AND CERTAINLY A IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHETHERE OR NOT I GIVEN EXERCISE LIKE KEGLES ARE GOING TO BE GOOD OR NOT GOOD AM IF IT'S SUCCESSIVE WHAT YOU KNOW HOW MANY SETS AND RAPSBE A DOES DOES IT TAKE BEFORE IT GOES FROM FROM GOOD TO BAT IS THERE A KIND OF GENERAL RULE OF THUM FOR PEOPLE O THINK ABOUT THAS IMMING CLEARLY BLOOD FLOW TO THAT AREA'S KEY RIGHT FOR SEXTUAL PERFORMANCE AND YET WHEN ONE TRAINS THE LAGS AR EVEN WALKS YOU'RE GTTING BLOOD FLOW SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS THAT A COMMINATION OF WAIGT TRAINING TO STIMULATE THE POSITIVE HORMONAL AND MUSCULAR AND AM  CONNECTIVE TISSUE GROWTH IS KEY DRIDES NOT OVERTRAINING BUT SO IS CASUAL EXERCISE LIKE WALKING AND STRETCHING AND THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WILL THEN RETURN BLOOD FLOW O THAT AREA IS THAT IT A OVERLY BASIC WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT OR WILL THAT SUFFICE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD WHAT TO THINK ABOUT IT A I THINK THE MAIN POINT WITH KEYGLES IS THERE JUST ONE OF MANY DIFFERENT THINGS SO  FUR HAVING SOME PELVIC FLOOR PATHOLOGIES CERTAINLY OR EVEN JUST CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR PELVIC FLOOR DON'T JUST A YOU KNOW TAKE THE ADVICE DU KEYGLES AN YOUL YEOCE THAT IS NOT NEAR ENOUGH IT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY ASPECTS AM O CASE OF GOING BACK TO THE RAPID KUANA AND THE WEILL COME BACK TO THIS SISSUE OF BLOOD FLOAK CAS ARE SOME INTERESTING SCIENCE AND PROTOCOLLS THERE QUESTION I HAVE IS ALCOHOL DOES IT INCREASE A ROMATASTE THE ENDS I'M THAT CONVERTS TOSTOSTRON INTO ESURGEN OR NOT AND AM IS THERE A DOSE DEPENDENCE THERE IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY DOES THERE IS A DOSE DEPENDENCE IN GENERAL I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND MORE THAN A THREET O FOR NO STANDARD DRINKS A ONE HUGE GLASS OF WINE IS PROBABLY FIVE STANDARD DRINKS BUT A A SAY EVERY TWO WEEKS IF THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT AM A DISCOVERED RESEARCHING A ALCOLL ON EPISODE WE DID ON ALCHOLL THAT NO ALCOHOL IS DEFINITELY BETTER FOR ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH AN ANY ALCOLLIN ANYONE THAT SAYS THAT WELL RED WINE CONTAINS THESE VARIOUS THINGS WELL IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ENOUGH OF THOSE POSITIVE THINGS TO HAVE A POSIVE EFFECT BUT THAT IF PEOPLE DO OPT TO DRINK ALCHOL THAT TWO DRINKS PER WEEK AND MEANING TWENTY GRAMS OF ALCOHOLL SO THAT'S PROBABLY TWO TWELVEOUNCEBEERS OR TO UNIFOUR OUNCE GLASSES OF WINE IS  GOING TO BE THE UPPER LIMIT BEYOND WHICH YOU'REGOING TO START SEEN ALL SORTS OF NEGATIVE OF FACTS THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN IND WITH ALCOHOLIS AS A LOT OF CALORIES SEVEN KULICALORIES PROGRAM ALMOST AS MUCH AS FAT WHICH IS NINE AND THEN IT'S ALSO VERY GABA URGIT SO AT IT IT CAN ACTIVATE INHIBITORY NERO TRANSMISSION AM AND THAT CAN ALSO EFFECT HOW MANY HOW MUCH A ELATIAN EFFISAGES RELEASED SO THAT CAN ALSO DECREASE TOSTOSTRONE ALMOST KIND OF A SIMILAR TO HOW OPIATS CAN DECREASE TO STOSTRO I'M FEEL VERY LUCKY THAT I DON'T ENJOY ILL CALL NEVER REALLY DID YOU CAN'T TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT UM CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE SEDITIVES LIKE VALUME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WHICH AS YOU JUST MENTION CAN SUPPRESS TO STOSTRONE UM YOU SAID THE WORD FAT SO UM I'M GIN TO PICK UP ON THAT AN SAY IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE HORMON PRODUCTION IS IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME SATURATED FAT IN ONE'S DIET UM AND WHAT HAPPENS ON VERY LOW FAT DIETS TO TOSTOSTERON ESTROGEN ANOTHER STURROR HORMONTS FATS INTERESTING BECAUSE AM THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT BENEFICIAL FATS I'LL MAKE A THREES ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN GETS PLENTY OF WILL MAKE A SIXES ANNY DEVELOPED COUNTRY REALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SATURATED FAT THERE IS MORE OF A CORRELATION WITH HORMONOPTIMIZATION IF YOU'RE EATING THINGS WITH SATURATED FAT YOU TEN TO HAVE THOSE ARE THINGS WITH MORE YOU KNOW FAT SOLUABLE FIDEMENDS AND THINGS THAT A VERY NEUTRYAN DINTE OTHERWISE BUT IT IS NOT VITAL IN GENERAL YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE ANY TRANS FAT UNLESS IT'S TRANSFAT FROM THE RUMINAT THERE'S ALWAYS AN EXCEPTION TO EVERYTHING RIGHT SO THERE IS HEALTHY TRANS IT'LL MAKE A THREE FATS WHICH ARE I'M FORM IN THE STOMACH OF LIKE GRASS FET AND FINISHED A RUMINOUCS BUT INGUSTING MOSTLY OLIVE OILS MAYBE NOTBUTTERS IN LIMITED AMOUNTS CAS THE VERY A GALORY DENTS BUT A UNLESS WE WERE TRYN INCREASE THEIR CALORSI WHICH GASES OIR GREAT SORTS OF COIS AM SMALL AMOUNTS OF BUTTER GE PROBABLY OKE BU NOT EXCESSIVE AMOUNCE AS ARITY THIS FAT IS PERFECTLY FINE COLLESTERALL HAS AN INTEREST IS A COLESTERAL AND A GENERAL PHOSPHO LIPIDS MAKE THE BILAYER THAT'S AROUND THE SELL BUT COLLESTERAL IS ALSO HORMONE IN IT OF ITSELF BECAUSE IT BINDS TO THE ESTROGEN RELATED RECEPTER ALPHA SI CONSIDER THAT LIKE IN THE ESTROGEN RECEPTR CATEGORY AND THAT CAN HELP WITH MATABOLISM BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY HAVE CONCERNS FOR CANCER AN TUMOR RISK WHEN IT GO BACK TO THE PROSTATE AND  TALK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S IT GAN OF IN NEWER EMERGING TREND I KNOW THAT AM YOU'VE TALK TO LOBIT ABOUT THIS IN A PREVIOUS POD CAST THAT A NUMBER OF MEN I SHOULD SAY NUMBER PHYSICIANS ARE PRESCRIBING LOW DOSE TO DALIFILL ALSO KNOWN O SEALIS TO THEIR MAL PATIENTS SO IN DOSIS RANGES OF LIKE TWO POINT FIVE MELIGRAMS TO FIVE MELIGRAMS PERDAY BUT NOT FOR E RECTILE TISFUNCTION BUT RATHER FOR IMPROVING PROSTATE HEALTH AND PRESUMABLY THEY GET SORT OF ABOOST IN TERMS OF BLOOD FLOW UM TO THE GENT ILIA AS WELL BUT AGAIN NOT SPECIFICALLY TO DEAL WITH A ERECTILE TOS FUNCTION BUT TO DEAL WITH PROSTATE HEALTH AND BLOOD FLOW TO THE PROSTATE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU SOMETIMES OFTEN PRESCRIBE TO YOUR PATIENTS AND OF WHAT AGE TO DALIFILLE'S A VERY UNDERATED MEDICATION A THE AGE WOULD KIND OF DEPEND ON THE INDICATION SO TO DALIFILLE IS ALSO A BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION IT CAN VERY SLIGHTLY DECREASE BLOOD PRESSURE ESPECIALLY AT HIER DOSES AT HIERDOSE IS IT THE HO HI DOSE WOULD BE TWENTY MELOGRAMS NOT TWO POINT FIVE MELOGRAMS BUT CONSISTENTLY IT CAN SOMEWHAT EFFECT WITH THE CONES IN THE EYE THAT HAVE TO DO WITH RED AND GREEN SIGHT ALTHOUGH IF YOU REMOVE IT THAT AFFECT IS REFIR SOBASICALLY IF YOU DON'T NEED REALLY REALLY GOOD RED GREEN DISCRIMINATION YOU CAN TAKE HIER DOSES BUT IN GENERAL I RECOMMEND NO HIGHER THAN TEN MELOGRAMS A DAY USUALLY JUST TWO OR FIVE MELOGRAMS ONE A OTHER BENEFIT OR OTHER USE OF TO DALIFILLE IS THAT IT INCREASES THE DINCITY OF THE ANDRGEN RECEPTER SIMILARLY TO EL CARNATINE SO IT'S AN INTERESTING BENEFIT ANOTHER BENEFIT IS THAT IF YOU GIVE IT TO PEOPLE WITH NOCTERIA WHICH IS URINATING AT NIGHT IN GENERAL IT WILL CUT THE EPISODES IN HALF SO IT COULD GO FROM TWO TO ONE WHICH CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR YOUR SLEEP WHICH WILL SECOND DARILY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR YOUR GROWTHFULMAN AN TISTOSTRON OPTIMIZATION SEEMS SO YOU SAID TWO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MELEGRAMS PRERDAS GONTYPICAL FOR THESE PROSATE IN HANCING EFFACTS YES AND YOU MENTION THE IM POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS ON ADJUSTING VISUAL PERCEPTION AS A VISION N SCIENTIST IM THAT RINGS IN MY MIND BUT IN TERMS OF RED GREEN COLOUR DISCRIMINATION I'M GUESSING MESS YOU CAN BE A SUBJECT IN ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS IN MY LAB WHERE YOU WANT TO BE A FIGHT YOUR PILOT CHANCES ARE YOU CAN PROTTLY GET AWAY IT OR LESS RED GREEN COLOR DISCRIMINATION CORRECT IT'S NOT CONSIDERED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT UNLESS AM SOMEONE IS A COMMERCIAL PILOT RIGHT SO SOME ONE'S GETTING THERE LIKE PILOT EXAM THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOK FOR I SO COMMERCIAL PILOT'S ASIDE YOU MIGHT ONE ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT LO DOSE TO DALIFILL FORSAKE OF ENHANCING PROSTATE HEALTH I'M CERTAINLY MONITOR IN P SA PROSTATE SPICIBEGANTIGEN IS IMPORTANT I CAN GIVE AN ANECDOTE THERE IM WHEN I A TRIED TERMORAL AND ONE OF THE SURPRISING SIDE EFFECTS THAT WAS NOT WELCOME WAS A DRAMATIC SPIKE IN MY PROSTATE SPICIVEGANTAGEN NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT WOULD A HAPPEN BUT WHEN I STOPTAKIN STERMORAL AND IT WENT BACK TO NORMALSO 'S ONE REASON I AVOID SER MORAL AN AT LEAST FREQUENT USE OF SIR MORLYN IM A P SA SHOULD BE KEPT WHAT BELOW LEVELS OF YOU KNO SOMEWHERE BETWEN ONE AND FOUR IS CONSIDERED HEALTHY IS THAT RIGHT IT DEPENDS ON THE AGE IF THERE'S A TWENTY YEAR OLD LIKELY BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE IF THERE'S A FORTY YEAR OL LIKELY BETWEEN ONE AND THREE AND THEN IF THERE IS AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD IT WOULD NOT BE ABNORMAL TO HAVE A P SE OF FIVE AND HAVE THAT BE WELL WITHIN THE REFERENCE RANGE ANOTHER THING WE SHOULD MENTION ABOUT P SAS IF YOU DO TAKE A FIVE ALFRODUCTAS IN HIBITER LIKE FINASTERIDE OR DU TASTERIDE OFTEN THESE WILL CUT YOUR P S A AN HALF SO IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A P S A OF SIX AND YOU START FINASTERIDER YOUTASTERIDE AND THEN YOU RECHECK IT IN SIX MONTHS AND ITS SIX POINT FIVE THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN BECAUSETHAT'S ACTUALLY DOUBLED GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS UP BECAUS A I ALMOST OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DRUGS TO OFF SET HAIRLOSS MOST OF THOSE DRUGS ARE GOING TO OPERATE THROUGH THE D H T SYSTEM THE DIHATERS ASTOSTERONE SYSTEM FOR THE REASONS WE TALKED ABY BEFORE D   RECEPTORS BEING ON THE SCALPAN IM CONTING BEAR GROWTH ON THE FACE UM IS IT THE CASE THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TING IM THINGS LIKE PROP TA AND OTHER THINGS TO BLOCK D H T OR DOSRUP THE D H T PATHWAY ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE DIMINISHED UM SEXTRIVE DIMINISHED AM YOU KNOW KIND OF MOTIVATION AND GENERAL VIGOR AND IF SO ARE THEIRE ALTERNATIVES LIKE TOPICAL D H T ANTAGONISTS THAT THEY MIGHT USE IM IF THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR HAIR BUT NOT HAVE THOSE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THE WAY THAT I THINK ABOUT A HAIR LOSS IS YOU HAVE YOUR FERTILIZERS ALSO ANUNDER THE GROWTH AGONIST AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR ANTI ANDROGENS WHETHER THERE'S A STEMIC OR TOPICAL THEIRE'S BOTH BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL LAYMAN'S WAY TO THINK ABOUT HAIR LOSS IF YOU'RE ONLY PUTTING FERTILIZER IN YOUR HAIR BUT YOU HAVE ANDROGENIC ALIPTURMAL PATERBALDNESS HAN THOSE HAIRS WILL STILL MINIATURIZE AND EVENTUALLY YOU'LL STILL HAVE LOSS SUCH A GREAT WORD MINIATURR IT'S ENOUGH TO SEND ANYBODY OFF TO FIND A THERAPUTIC AND BY THE WAY IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL IF MINIATURIZATIONS HAPPENING UNLESS YOU HAVE MAGNIFINE GLASS YOU CAN'T AATON OU T SECOND THER I TO NOW WIT THE OT YOU'RE MAKING A JOKE YOUR SAME AT MINIATURISZATION OF THE HAIRFOLICAL DIRECTS YOUI'S THE HARTON REVERSE THAT MANIATURIZATION GOT'S JUST A FUN WORD TO SAMINE JUST KEEP SAYING IT H INDIVIDUAL HAS A AGAIN WE MENTION THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR MALES ONLY HAVE ONE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR GENUS ON THEIR EXCHROMISOME SO TOPINION ON HOW SENSITIVE THAT ANDROGEN RECEPTOR IS ANDEPIN ON THE DINCIT OF THE IM RECEPTORS IN TH HAIRFOLICAL YOU CAN HAVE A ARBITRARY THRESHOLD AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THRESHOLD IS UNTIL YOU START O HAVE MENITURIZATION AND LOSS OF HAIR BUT OVER THE THRESHOLD TH FOLICAL WILL DIE AND EVENTUALLY THE STEMSELL WILL LEAVE BUT UNDER THE THE THRESHOLD EURO K EVERY ANDROGEN BINDS TO THE SAME ANDROGEN RECEPTOR SO THERE IS NOTHING SPESIAL ABOUT D H T D H T IS JUST A STRONGER ANDROGEN SO THE HIGHER YOUR S H B G THINGS THAT INCREASE S H B G OR BENEFICIAL FOR HAIR LOST PREVENTION BECAUSE YOU HAVE LESS BINDING OF THAT RECEPTOR SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT HAIR LOSS PECIFICALLY ANDROGENIC OR MALE PATTERNBALDNESS IN THE TERMS OF THAT ANDROGEN RECEPTOR AND EVERYTHING IN GENERAL BINDING TO IT NOT JUST D H T BUT ALSO TESTOSTRONE IT'S HELPFUL IT'S JUST THAT D H T IS A HUGE BATTERING RAM WHEREAS THE OTHER ANDROGENS ARE JUST LIGHT PRESSES ON THE DOOR GOT IT SO ARE SOME OF THE TOPICAL D H T R ESCEPTER ANTAGONITS GOING TO BE A BETTER CHOICE FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO MAINTAIN OR THEIR HAIR GROW MORE HAIR AM IF THEY WANT AVOID SIDE EFFECTS LIKELY SO SOME INDIVIDUALS A BENEFIT FROM SYSTEMIC A SYSTEMIC DECREASE IN D H T FOR A COUPLE REASONS ONE COULD BE PROSTATE AND THEN ONE COULD ACTUALLY B HYPERTROFY OF THE MILE CARIUM SO D H T ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY THICKENS THE VENTROCAL SO FOR SOME ONE ON T R T THAT MIGHT BE A BENEFIT THAT IS PRONE TO THICKENING TO THE VENTROCAL AT BASE LINE HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE JUST A BIT OF PREDISPOSITION THEYC CAN USE THINGS THAT ARE TOPICAL ANTI ANDROGENS A KEETO CONIZALL IS ONE OF THEM KAFFINE IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER ONE A DRINKING KAFFI TOPICAL CAFF A YES AY MY HAIR TENDS GORE PRETTY FAST AS SO IT MAY BE BUT I DRINK ALOT I CAFFI INTA TOPICAL CAFFINE REALLY RUBBING COFFEE ON THEIR HEAD IT WERE WE'RE TAKING CAFFINE TABLETS AND HASN'T WAIT YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS WORKS HOW DO PEOPLE GET KAFFINE INTO THE HEROLICL AM TOPICALY THE KAFFINE ENTERS THE SCALP AND CROWDS OUT LIKE SOMEWHAT CROWDS OUT THE ANDERGEN IT IS A WEAK EFFECT IT'S LIKELY JUST STRONG ENOUGH TO BE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT USUALLY CAFFINE IS PUT INTO FORMULATIONS WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE KETO CONOSALL THAT ARE ALSO WEAK ANTI ANDROGENS OF NOTE BERONAL ACTONE CAN BE PRESCRIBED TOPICALLY BUT IS IT IS ABSORBED SYSTEMICALLY BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE MOLECULE SO UNLESS YOUR DOCTOR SPECIFICALY PRESCRIBES THAT FOR YOU ESPECIALLY AS A MALE DO NOT USE TOPICAL SPRONALACTONE TOPICAL FANASTERIDE IS ALSO A SMALLER MOLECULE SO IT IS ALSO SYSTEMICALLY ABSORBED BUT IT IS NOT EXTREMELY WELL SYSTEMIALLY ABSORBED IF YOU TAKE TOPICAL FINASTERIDE AND USUALLY YOUR SYSTEMIC D H T WILL DECREASE BY ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT TOPICAL DU TASTERDE IS LIKELY A TINY BIT STEMICALLY ABSORBED BUT ITS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT'S HALF LIFE IS MUCH FASTER AT A LOWER DOSE SO TOPICAL DU TASTERIDE WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR SYSTEMIC D H T AT ALL AND I'VE SEEN THIS ANECDOTALLY ON MANY PEOPLE ON TOPICAL DUTASTERIDE THERAPY YOU WERE CAN TO HAVE TO GET YOU BACK ON HERE DO AN EPISODE ALL ABOUT D H T IN HAIRILOSS IN HAIR GROWTH IS YOU KNOW GAN NOT A TOPY THY FOCAS ON A LOT FOR MYSELF AM BUT THAT I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FOR MEN AND WOMEN ONE THING THAT WE COULD MENTION AI GOT A TON OF QUESTIONS ABOUT TURMERIC AND KERCUMINOIDS AFTER A LAST EPISODE OYA BUT I'D REPORTED MY OWN ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE THAT TAKING TUMERIC REALLY CRUSHED MY D H T LEVELS AND I DID NOT FEEL GOOD I MAD CRUSHED ALL SORTS OF A POSITIVE FEELINGS OF VITALITY THE MOMENT I STOP TAKING TUMERIC VELL GRAT AGAIN MANY PEOPLE REPORT THIS AND A THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT TUMERIC IS MOST OF ITS BENEFICIAL ACTION NOT ALL OF IT SOME PEOPLE BENEFIT FROM SYSTEMIC A TUMERIC AND SOMEWEO BLE THAT CAN TOLERATE IT WELL IT'S ACTUALLY GREAT FOR THE PROSTATE BUT MOST OF THE ACTION IT DOES N OT NEED TO BE BILE VAILABLE IT ACTS ON THE GOT MICROBIUM SO YOU CAN TAKE TUMRIC AND IF IT IS NOT ABSORBED SOME TUMERICS AS PUT IN SPECIAL FORMULATIONS LIKE MY CELLER OR LIOSOMOL OR COMPLEX BUT A LOT OF IT AS PUT WITH BLACK PEPPER FRUIT EXTRACT WHICH IS ALSO IN AS BIO PERING WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALSO A FIVE OFRODOCTASON HIBITER AND IT EFFECTS LIVERSIDO CRUMS AND SO MANY SUPPLEMENT COMPANIES PUT THIS BLACK PEPPER FRUIT EXTRACT BIOE PERING AND ALMOST EVERYTHING SO SOME PEOPLE ARE ON REB HIDOSES AND THAT COULD ALSO BE MAKING MOST OF THE EFFECT OF PEOPLE A WHO DO NOT TOLERATE TUMERIC WELL YE I AVOID TUMRIC LIKE THE PLAGUE BASED ON THAT ONE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE CAS IT WAS CLEARLY TUMERIC THAT CAUSETHE IF THE NEGATIVE EFFECT COMAY OFFIT EVERYTHING REVERSE RAPIDLY AND BY APERING THE BLACK PEPPER EXTRACT I ALSO AVOID THAT LIKE THE PLAGUE BASE ON EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID I I WANT MY FIVE OLFOR DUCTAS I WANT MY D H T TO BE OPTIMIZE SIMPLY BECAUSE MINERSHANDING IS T H T IS THE WORE POWERFUL ANDROGEN N ITS THE ONE THAT YES IT CAUSES LL BIT A HEIRLOSS AND I'VE GOT A FEW YOU KNOW PATCHES HERE AND THERE BUT I'M GILLING TO LIVE WITH THAT I'M BASED ON ALL THE OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS THAT TH H T OPTIMIZATION DOES AL QUICKLY MENTION A FEW OTHER THINGS ONE SAL PALMETTO IS ALSO A FIVE OFRODUXASNHIBITER BUT ONLY A COUPLE OF THE ISOINZIMES THERE'S THREE MAN ISOINZIMES AND A LOT OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'RE INHIBITINE A COUPLE OF THE ISO INZIMES BUT NOT THE OTHER ONE FINASTERIDE INHIBITS ONE AND TWO DUTASTRIDE ACTUALLY INHIBITS ALL THREE AND A FINASTERITE INHIBITS THE ISO INZIME THAT IS IN GENITAL SKIN BUT NOT IN THE SKIN THROUGHOUT THE REST OF YOUR BODY SO A LOT OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF FINASTERIDE WHICH IS LOSS OF SENSATION AND LOSS OF ERECTILE FUNCTION HAVE TO DO WITH TH A DISCONCORDENCE BETWEEN THE SENSITIVITY OF THE GENITAL SKIN AND A SKIN AGAIN ANOTHER REASON TO NOT DESTROUT FIVE ALFOR DUCTES AND WE'LL DEVILNY GET YOU BACK ON HERE TO TALK ABOUT D IDING WEC SHO TOS DO WHOLE EPISODE ABOUT D H T BECAUSE SO OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE THINK ABOUT OPTIMIZING HORMONES SPECIALLY MAL MALES TRY NOPTIMIZED THEIR HORMONS THEY'RE THINKING TO STOSTERON TO STOSTERN MAYBE NOWADAYS THEY THINK L A BIT MORE ABOUT FREETISTOSTERON AND MAYBE THEY THINK ABOUT ESTERGEN IS ALSO BEING IMPORTANT NOT TO CRUSH ESTROGEN BUT D H T IS YOU KNOW AT LEAST TO MY MIND THE LYNCH PIN OF SO MANY THE THINGS THAT SUBJECTIVELY PEOPLE ARE REALLY FOKISED ON LEBEDO MOTE OV TION DRIVE ET CETERA I'VE ONE FINAL QUESTION IT'S JUST A BRIEF ONE BUT MANY OF US HAVE HEARD THAT THE B P AS UM THAT A PRESENT IN IN O PLASTIC BOTTLES AND EVEN IN CERTAIN ILLUMINUM KANS AND THALLITS A DIFFICULT WORD TO PRONOUNCE BUT A FUN ONE NONE THE LESS THALITES I'M AND WORK BY DOCTORSHAN O SWAN HAS SHOWN THAT TALLID EX A EXPOSURE TO THE FDUS TO PREGNANT MOTHERS IN T FTUSES VERY LIKELY IS IMNEGATIVELY IMPACTING SPERM COUNTS TO STOSTERONE LEVELS AND EVEN CHANGING IM GENITALIASIZES FOR THE WO RSE UM IN MALES NOWADAYS UM I SAW BEAUTIFUL LECTURE THAT A DOCTOR SHANIS WON DID ON THIS WHEN I WAS IN COPENHAGEN AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE MAL FEEDA SHE WAS ALSO IN JOROGEN'S PODCAST I HOPE TO GET ER ON THIS PODCAST HOWEVER WHAT SHE COULDN'T ANSWER FOR ME WAS WHETHER NOT TALATES AND B P AS IN THESE THINGS PRESENT IN PLASTICS AND SOME PEOPLE IN PLAMIN TAP WATER ARE BAD FOR MALES AFTER THEY'RE BORN AND AFTER PUBERTY WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHY SHOULD JUST ASK YOU DO YOU DRINK WATER OUT OF PLASTIC BOTTLES DO YOU AVOID DRINKING OUT OF CANS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY NON B P A CONTAINING CANS AND DO YOU ACTIVELY AVOID TALLATES MY UNDERSTANDINGS THAT VALLETS ARE MOST ENRICHED IN PESTICIDES AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING DRAMATIC DROPS AN SPERM AND TESTACTRAN LEVELS MAINLY IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THEY'RE DUST CROPPING SO I DO AVOID DRINKING OUT OF KANS THAT AR PLASTICS THAT MAY HAVE A B P E OR BISFENALE A IN THEM BISPENALE A IS KNOWN TO BINE TO A WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER THE FIFTH ESTRGEN RECEPTER ESTRGEN RELATED RECEPTOR GAMLA SO IT IT I WOULD I WOULD CONSIDER IT A ZENO ESTERGEN SO FIDO ESTROGENS ARE ESTROGENS FROM PLANTS AND IN GENERAL THEY'RE NOT CONCERNING OR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND ZENO ESTRGENS ARE JUST OTHER ESTROGENS SO I DO AVOID A B P E AND I ALSO TEST MY WATER A I YOU SA WATER TESTING SERVICE AND I TEST IT BOTH AFTER ITS THROUGH MY WATER FELTER AND THE TAP WATER THAT MY TWO BOYS DRINK ALMOST EVERY DAY AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING I ONLY FOUND ONE MICROL PLASTIC JUST A BIT OVER THE REFERENCE RANGE AM SO WASN'T A TERRIBLE TAPSCORE BUT EVEN IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THESE ARE WIDELY FARIABLE AS FAR AS A PUTTHALATES M AGAIN VERY DIFFICULT AN INTERESTING PER TO PRONOUNCE BUT I REMEMBER LEARNING ABOUT THESE BECAUSE THERE IS I BELIEVE A LOSS SUIT IM THAT HAD TO DO WITH MACK AND CHEESE AND I'M THIS PROBABLY FIVE YEARS AGO AND I WAS COMING UP WITH MY LIST OF A EACH PROVIDER THAT DOES OBSTETRIC HAS A LIST WHAT TO AVOID FOR THE PREGNANT LADY YOU KNOW A SKETCHY DELLY MEATS OR A HIGH MERCURY FISH LIKE SORTFISH AND SAMON AND ACTUALLY ADDED PROCEST MACKANCHEESE TO THAT LIST INTERESTING THANK YOU

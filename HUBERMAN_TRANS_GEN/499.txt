WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONN  SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TOE I MAYN DRHUBERMAN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND WE ARE ALSO DISCUSSING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS THE BRAIN SFINAL CORD AND THE CONNECTIONS OF THE BRAIN AND SFINAL CORD WITH ALL THE ORGANS OF THE BODY WE ARE ALSO GOING TO DISCUSS HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO ACTIVATE IN CONTROL THE MMUNE SYSTEM ABOUT TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO FSOMEBODY SAID THAT THE MIND COULD CONTROL THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IT PROBABLY GET LAUGHED OUT OF MOST ACADEMIC CONFERENCES AND CERTAINLY THE WORK WOHELDN'T BE PUBLISHED IN QUALITY JOURNALS BUT NOWADAYS THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF QUALITY PURE REVIEED STUDIES ON HOW THE MIND AND HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN CONTROL ACTIVATION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THIS IS A WONDERFUL GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A HINT OF WHERE WE ARE HEADED WITH THIS JUST THIS LAST WEEK THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED IN NATURE WHICH IS THE APEX JOURNAL FOR SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING PREMURE JOURNAL EXTREMELY STRINGENT A PAPER PUBLISHED IN NATURE FROM CHUFUMA'S LAB AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL EXPLORED HOW ACCUPUNCTURE CAN REDUCE INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY AND I WILL DESCRIBE THE STUDY IN A BIT MORE DETAIL LATER BUT WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WAS THAT BY STIMULATING THE BODY IN PARTICULAR WAYS THAT PARTICULAR SYTES ON THE BODY THEY WERE ABLE TO LIBERATE CERTAIN SELLS AND MOLECULES THAT ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF THE IMUNE SYSTEM AND POTENTIALLY CAN BE USED TO COMBAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFECTION AND JUST GIVE YOU ANOTHER LITTLE HINT THEY FOUND THAT A PARTICULAR TYPE OF ORGAN TISSUE CALLED FASIA SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF FASHIA FASIA SURROUNDS OUR MUSCLES JUST TO LOOK AT IT YOU MIGHT THINK ITS A KIND OF USELESS TISSUE AT SORT LIKE A DENSE BAG THAT IN WHICH THE MUSCLES ARE CONTAINED WELL TURNS OUT THAT THOSE DENSE BAGS ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN BUT BY STIMULATING THE FASIA IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION ON THE BODY THERE IS A PATHWAY LEADING OUT OF THAT FASIA DIRECTLY TO AAN ORGAN CALLED THE ADRENAL MEDULLA I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT ALL THIS MEANS THAT COULD LIBERATE PARTICULAR CHEMICALS THAT HAD A POTENT ANTI INFLAMMATORY EFFECT  WERE BASICALLY SAYING IS THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTS AS A SET OF HIGHWAYS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TISSUES OF YOUR BODY CALLING INTO ACTION THE IMMUNE SYSTEM LIBERATING PARTICULAR MOLECULES THAT CAN REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND LEAD TO FASTER HEALING AND I WILL EXPLAIN HOW ALL OF THAT WORKS AS WELL AS SOME OTHER NON ACCUPUNCTURE METHODS FOR ACTIVATING AND ENHANCING THE FUNCTION OF THE MUNE SYSTEM SO TO DAY WERE CAN BE TALKING ALL ABOUT HEALING WITH THE MIND IN A COMPLETELY NON MISTICAL NONABSTRACT SINSE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIREAN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN AL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST HE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGRENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL F MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIG HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUNE SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBIICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LLGIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR I'VE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM IND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION END THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN ND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN OK LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HOW THE TWO INTERACT AND HOW YOU CAN CONTROL EURIMIAN SYSTEM TO SERVE YOU BETTER WE ARE GOING TO TALK A LOT O MECHANISTIC SCIENCE LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL YOU LEARN SOME NEW LANGUAGE AROUND THE UMUNE SYSTEM NAMES OF THE DIFERENT SELL TYPES AND SO FORTH BUT I PROMISE TO MAKE IT ALL VERY CLEAR REGARDLESS OF YOUR BACKGROUND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO DISCUSS A LOT OF TOOLS AND I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY HERE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO IN ORDER TO BOOST OR ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF YOUR MUNE SYSTEM AND SA VERY REASONABLE QUESTION TO ASK I WANT TO BEGIN BY JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IF ONE WERE TO PUT THAT QUESTION INTO THE INTERNET YOU WOULD GET BACK A LOT OF ANSWERS AND THERE IS NOW A SORT OF GENERIC FORM OF THAT ANSWER THAT DESERVES OUR RESPECT BUT IS NOT GOING TO BE THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION TO DAY I JUST WANT O TIP MY HAT TO IT HOWEVER AND LIST OFF OF FEW OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW SET US UP TO BE HEALTHIER THEN WE WOULD BE IF WE DIDN'T DO THESE THING SO THE FIRST OF COURSE IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH WHICH IS TO GET ADEQUATE SLEEP MEANING ENOUGH SLEEP WHATEVER IT IS FOR YOU THAT YOU REQUIRE TO GET DEEP SLEEP S IT'S GOT A BE OF HIGH QUALITY AND TO TIME THAT SLEEP CORRECTLY MEANING YOU CAN'T SLEEP DURING THE DAY ONE DAY AND AT NIGHT THE NEXT DAY AND EXPECT YOUR SYSTEM TO FUNCTION WELL TALKS A LOT ABOUT THAT BEFORE ON THIS POTCAST YOU NEED A RELATIVELY CONSISTENT SLEEP SCADUAL MOST OF THE TIME ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE TIME OR EVEN BETTER WOULD BE NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME BUT THE REALITIES OF LIFE MAKE IT THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS GO TO BED AT THE SAME TIME AND WAKE UP AT T THE EXACT SAME TIME LOOKE SO WE NEED SLEEP WE DO NEED SUNSHINE WHY DO WE NEED SUNSHINE BECAUSE IT SETS OUR RHYTHM IN TO A REGULAR STATE WHERE THE GENES IN ALL OF OUR CELLS CAN BE EXPRESSED AT THE CORRECT TIMES WHERE SORT OF A FACTORY OF CELLS IF YOU WILL IN THAT FACTORY CAN ONLY RUN PROPERLY IF IT KNOWS WHEN CERTAIN THINGS SHOULD BE ACTIVE AND WHEN CERTAIN CELLS SHOULD NOT BE ACTIVE AND THE BEST WAY TO CORDINATE ALL OF THOSE ACTIVITIES OF ALL THE CELLS IS TO GET SUNSHINE IN YOUR EYES IN THE MORNING AND AGAIN IN THE EVENING AND NOT TO GET TOO MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT'S JUST FOUNDATIONAL AND THEN ANY LIST THAT YOU'LL FIND ON ANY NUMBER OF WEBSIHES ON THE INTERNETT WOULD SAY O CAY GET GOOD SLEEP GET SUN I GET EXERCISE HOW MUCH EXERCISE WE SHOULD ALL BE GETTING A HUNDRED FIFTY TO A HUNDRED N EIGHTY MINUTES OF ZON TOO CARDIO THAT S CARDIO VASCULAR EXERCISE WHERE WE CAN JUST BARELY HOLD A CONVERSATION OR MAY BE NOT PER WEEK WE SHOULD BE EATING WELL WE'RE LWAYS TOLD WE HAVE TO GET GOOD NUTRITION WHAT GOOD NUTRITION MEANS TO YOU IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT MEANS TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT A WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOOD IN TAKE AND QUALITY OF FOOD IN PARTICULAR AVOIDING PROCESS FOOD SAISS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT SOCIAL CONNECTION IS IMPORTANT HYDRATION IS IMPORTANT YOURESTARTING TO GET THE PICTURE WE CAN TAKE ALL THAT ACKNOWLEDGE IT AS USEFUL AND FOUNDATIONAL FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO STILL STRUGGLE WITH GETTING ILL TOO OFT IN OR WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAL FROM PHYSICAL INJURIES AND WOUND S OR FROM A VARIOUS BACTERIAL INVIRAL INFECTIONS QUICKLY ENOUGH OR DEAL WITH CHRONIC DISEASE AND SO TO DAY IS REALLY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN TAKE ALL OF THAT AT INFORMATION ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND FOLLOW IT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO  TO LEVERAGE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM IN VERY ROBUST WAYS SO THAT'S WHAT ID LIKE TO SHIFT THE CONVERSATION TO THE FIRST TOPIC WE HAVE TO ATTACK IS THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE IMUNE SYSTEM AND HOW DOES IT WORK I THINK MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANTIBODIES OR KILLER CELLS OR THE VARIOUS ORGANS OF THE BODY THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE UMION SYSTEM LIKE THE BONE MARROW THE SPLEEN THE THIMUS AND THE LIMPH NODES I LIKE TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND DU A SORT OF BRIEF IMMUNE SYSTEM ONE OR ONE REALLY SIMPLE COVER THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE MION SYSTEM SO THAT EVERY ONE LISTENING OR WATCHING THIS CAN GET A CLEAR SENSE OF HOW THE IMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND WHAT ITS BASIC PARTS ARE FOR SOME OF YOU THIS MIGHT BE TWO BASIC MIHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND YOU ALREADY KNOW I THNK FOR MOST OF YOU THIS INFORMATION WILL BE NEW AND I PROMISE YOU YOU DON'T NEED A BI BIOLOGY OR MEDICINE BACKGROUND IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY SIMPLE BECAUSE IT IS TRULY ELEGANT IN DESIGN YOU HAVE THREE MAIN LAYERS OF DEFENSE FOR YOUR HEALTH THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY AT WORK TO PROTECT YOU FROM INVASION AND ILLNESS FROM BACTERIA FROM VIRUSES AND FROM PARASIDES AND THE FIRST OF THOSE THREE IS A PHYSICAL BARRIER THAT WE CALL YOUR SKIN THAT MIGHT SEEM KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU IS CONTAINED IN THIS COMPARTMENT THAT IS BOUNDARIED BY YOUR SKIN AND YOUR SKIN IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF YOURIMUNE SYSTEM IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A CUT YOU ASSENTIALLY HAVE A BREACH OF THE BOUNDARY THAT IS YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM AND YOU WOULD NOTICE A NUMBER OF THINGS WOULD HAPPEN YOU MIGHT I GET SOME SWELLING AROUND THAT CUT A YOU MIGHT GET A SCAB LIKELY YOU WOULD GET A SCAB OVER TIME YOU  IF OU GOT DIRTY THERE ARE SOME BACTERIA THAT GOT IN THERE YOU MIGHT SEE SOME ACCUMULATION OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS WHAT'S CALLED POSSI NOW IT'S KONT OF GROSS BUT THAT'S WHAT THAT IS YOU MIGHT TAKE ON A YELLOW TINT BECAUSE OF THE A ACCUMULATION OF SOME DEAD CELLS THERE BUT BASELY YOUR SKIN IS THE PRIMARY BARRIER THROUGH WHICH YOU KEEP THINGS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT COULD HARM YOU FROM GETTING TO THE INSIDE NOW STILL IN CATEGORY ONE YOUAR BODY IN YOUR EXTERNAL SURFACE YOU HAVE OPENINGS TO THAT SURFACE RIGHT YOU'RE NOT JUSTA ROUND A OR A BODY SHAPED A CCOMPLETELY COVERED UP WITH SKIN YOU HAVE OPENINGS WHAT ARE THOSE OPENINGS WILL IT START AT THE TOP AND WORK OUR WAY DOWN A PRIMARY SITE OF POTENTIAL INFECTION ARE YOUR EYES YIF YOUR EARS YOV YOUR NOSTRILS YOF YOUR MOUTH IF THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY SIGHTES BY WHICH THINGS CAN GET INTO YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU NEED TO PUT THNGS INTO YOUR SYSTEM YIN YOU TO DRINK AND EAT AND YOU NEE O GET LIGHT INT YOUR SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE THOSE OPENINGS BUT BAD THINGS MEANING THINGS THAT CAN HARM YOU CAN GET INTO THOSE SYSTEMS AND THEN OF COURSE ALONG THE BACK YOUR THROAT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR STOMACH IN YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THROUGH YOUR INTESTINS AND OUT YOUR RECTUM YOU HAVE A TUBE THAT YOU ARE BASICALLY A SERIES OF TUBES HAVE SAID THAT BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST AND THIS IS ONE SUCH TUBE BY WHICH YOU EXTRACT NUTRIENCE FROM THE OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENT BUT ALL ALONG THAT TUBE INCLUDING YOUR NOSE AND YOUR MOUTH IT'S LINED WITH MUCUS AND WHILE MUCUS MIGHT SEEM KIND OF GROSS TO SOME OF YOU THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT MUCUS THEM WORE YOU REALIZE THAT MUCUS IS REALLY REALLY COOL BECAUSE MUCUS ESSENTIALLY ACTS AS AY FILTER AS A TRAP FOR BACTERIA ENVIRUSES END IT HAS CERTAIN WAYS OF SCRUBBING OR KILLING THOSE BACTERIA ENVIRUSES NOW THE MUCUS IS CONSTANTLY BEING TURNED OVER AS WILL TALK ABOUT LATER THE CHEMISTRY OF THAT MUCUS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT CERTAIN THINGS DON'T MAKE IT INDO YOUR SYSTEM AND OTHER THINGS ARE ALLOWED TO MOVE THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU CAN EXTRACT NUTRIENCE FROM THEM SO THE REASON I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS FIRST CATEGORY OF A BARRIER FOR IMMUNE SYSTEM IN SUCH DETAIL AS I'D LIKE YOU TO INVISION YOURSELF AS A CUMAN OF COURSE BUT AS A HUMAN THAT IS A A CLEAR ENTITY FROM EVERYTHING ELSE AND YOU HAVE TO BRING IN THE RIGHT THINGS HAND YOU HAVE TO KEEP OUT THE WRONG THINGS OR KILL THEM NOW INNEVITABLY BACTERIA VIRUSES AND PARASITIC INFECTIONS ARE GOING TO MAKE THEIR WAY INTO OUR BODY BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE KILLED OFF OR WHETHER NOT THEY TAKE OVER AND CALULSE US HARM IS GOING TO BE DETERMINED BY LAYERS TWO AND THREE SO LAYERS TWO AND THREE ARE THE SO CALLED INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM SO THE INNATE IMUNE SYSTEM IS WHAT I WILL CALL THE SECOND LAYER OF DEFENCE IT'S VERY FAST SO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BACTERIA VIRUS OR PARASITE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING ENTER YOUR BODY MAYBE YOU SWALLOWED IT MAY BE GOT IN THROUGH YOUR EYES MAY BE AH YOU KNOW YOU SHOOK SOMEBODY'S HAND WHO IS CARRYING UP PARTICULAR A KIND OF ILLNESS AND THEN YOU WIPED YOUR EYES AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT O THIS PODCAST BEFORE VERY SOON AFTER WE MEET ANOTHER PERSON YUSUALLY WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS BELIEVE IT OR NOT MOST PEOPLE WIPE THOUGH THAT PERSONS CHEMICALS SOMEWHERE ON THEIR FACEOR OR ON THEIR BODY SURFACE AS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AH THAT YOU ANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT WE DIDN'T EPISODE ALL ABOUT CHEMICAL SIGNALLING WHERE YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT IT I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD AND YOU MIGHT SAY I DON'T DO THAT BUT INDEED YOU DO A MOST OF THE TIME MOST EVERYBODY DOES CAS TO THIS INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS THIS RAPID RESPONSE WHEN SOMETHING ENTERS OUR SYSTEM AND OUR BODY DOESN'T RECOGNIZE IT IT'S NOT FOOD IT'S NOT CLEAN AIR IT'S SO MTHING THAT'S EITHER A BACTURIA VIRIS OR PARASITE AND THE INADEMIAN SYSTEM INVOLVES THE RELEASE OF PARTICULAR CELLS THAT ARE WAITING DORMENT READY TO ATTACK WHATEVER THIS INVADER IS AND SOME OF THESE SELLTIPES YOU'VE HEARD OF BEFORE THE MOST TYPICAL ONE ARE THEY CARE THE SO CALLED  WHITE BLOOD CELLS SO THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS WILL ACTIVELY GO TO THE SITE OF INVASION AND WILL START TO ENCAPSILATE OR TRYIN UM SURROUND THAT GIVE AN INVADER THE OTHER NAMES OF THESE DIFFERENT CELLTYPES OR THINGS LIKE NEUTRAFILLS NATURAL PHAGES NATURAL KILLER CELLS JUST A FEW OF THE MANY TYPES OF IMMUNECELLS SO THEIS GINS LIKE AN AMBULENT SYSTEM BUT RATHER THAN GO AND TRY AND KEEL SOMETHING LIKE A PARAMETIC WOOLD THEY GO THERE AND THEY TRY AND SURROUND AND KILL WHATEVER THIS INVADER IS THEY WORK IN CONCERT WITH TWO OTHER ASSISTANTS AND THOSE ASSISTANTS ARE CALLED THE COMPLEMENT PROTINES COMPLEMENT PROTINES EXIST IN THE BLOOD AND WHAT THEY DO AS THEY TRAVEL TO SITES WHERE THEREIS AN INVASION AND THEY MARK CERTAIN THINGS FOR BEING ENGULFED AND EATEN SO THEY SORT PUT A A AND EAT ME TAG ON IT A THEY THEY BASILY PUT A CHEMICAL TAG ON TO INVADERS THAT THEN ALOUS THOSE WHITE BLOOD CELLS NEUTRAPHILLS MACRIPHAGES AND ACTUR KILLER CELLS TO SAY A I NEED TO YOU KNOW I NET ABASELY RAPTYOU'LL KILL THIS THING AND THEN RAPID IN A BODY BAGON SEND IT OFF KILL THAT THING RAPID IN A BODY BAGONSEND IT OFF AND I'M USING THE ANALOGY OF THE BODY BAG BUT A IN THE CENS IT IS ONE A IT'S THE RIGTE ONE RATHER BECAUSE THESE CELLS THAT COME IN AND KILL THINGS THE WAY THEY DO THAT AS ACTUALLY TO INGULF THE INVADING BACTERIA VIRIS OR PARASITES SO THEY SHE SURROUND IT AND WHEN YOU SEE POSSOR YOU SEE INFECTION AM IT IN A MAY BE A  CUT ON THE SKIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR EVEN IN IT A INGROWN HAIR THAT I GET SOME BACTERIA IN IT THAT POSSIN THAT THE THE WHITE PART I KNOW IT'S CONT OF GROSS TO TALK ABOUT BUT THOSE ARE THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND THOSE OF THE DEAD OFTENTIMES ITS DEAD CELLS AND THAT'S THE DEAD INVADER SITTING THERE SO IT'S TRYING TO CREATA IN ISOLATED COMPARTMENT CAUSE ANCE TO KEEP IT IN THAT PART OF THE BODY OK  YOU GET THE INADEMIAN SYSTEM THE COMPLEMENT COMES THROUGH BLOOD AND HELPS IT BY TAGGING CERTAIN THINGS WITHIN EAT ME SIGNAL AND THEN THERE ARE THE CELLS THAT ARE EITHER DAMAGE FROM THE INJURY OR FROM THE PARASITE OR ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE BACTERIA OR THE VIRIS ITCELF AND THE CELLS OF YOUR BODY WILL ALSO RELEASE AN ALARM SIGNAL WHICH IS NOT AND EAT ME SIGNAL BUT A HELP ME SIGNAL AND THOSE HELP ME SIGNALS COME IN THE FORM WHAT WE CALL SITEA KINDS AND THE SIHT OF KINDS ARE THINGS LIKE INTERLUKAN ONE INTERLUCAN SIX TUMR NACROSIS FACTOR ALPHA YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THESE THINGS IF YOU ARE IT ALL A CURIOUS ABOUT OR BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE HEALTH SPACE A ON LINE HELSPACE ESPECIALLYIN THE LAST TO YEARS INFLAMMATION IS ALL THE BUZZ WORD NOW EVERYONE STALK OF INFLAMMATION INFLAMM TION INFLAMMATION WHAT DO WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY INFLAMMATION WELL INFLAMMATION IS A PHYSICAL RESPONSE BUT'S ALSO A CHEMICAL RESPONSE AND MANY TIMES THE MARKERS OF INFLAMMATION THAT ARE MEASURED IN PEOPLE OR AN ANIMAL MODIES MODELS CUSES ME WHERE THIS RESEARCH IS DONE ARE THINGS LIKE INTERLUCIN ONE INTERLUCAN SIX TUMER NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA SO WHEN THOSE GO UP IN THE BLOOD IT'S A SIGN THAT SOMEWHERE THE'S A CELL THAT SAYING HELP ME HELP ME AND IS SECRETING THESE THINGS WHICH CALLS IN THOSE NEUTRAPHILL'S MACRAPHAGERS NATURAL KILLER CELLS AND WHITE BLOOD CELLS  AND IT MIGHT HELP TO REMEMBER ALL THIS BUT BY JUST TELLING PEOPLE THAT WHAT INTERLUCAN MEANS IS TO COMMUNICATE RIGHT SO THE INTERLUCAN I SHOUTING OUT HELP ME THE COMPLEMENTPROTINES ARE COMING IN AND SAYING EAT EAT THIS ANTAGGING THE THE INVADER WITH AN EATME SIGNAL AND THEN THE KILLER CELLS AND THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS ARE DOING THE JOB OF OF TRYNTO KILL OFF THAT THING THAT'S THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEMSO TH YOUR SKIN AND URMUCUS LINING PLUS YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM ARE A BEAUTIFUL TWO LAYERED SET OF DEFENSES AGAINST VARIOUS KINDS OF INVADERS AND INFECTIONS AND THEN THERE'S THE THIRD TYPE WHICH IS THE ADAPT OF IMUNE SYSTEM AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT LEADING UP UNTIL NOW I HAVEN'T SAID THE WORD ANTIBODY AT ALL AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS THE JOB NOT OF THE SKIN OR THE MUCUS OR THE MICROBIOM OR THE INNATE MMUNE SYSTEM TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES THAT CAN RECOGNIZE SPECIFIC INVADERS BUT RATHER IT IS THE JOB OF THE ADAPTOF IMMUNE SYSTEM TO CREATE ANTBODIES AGAINST BACTERIA VIRUSES AND EVEN PARACITES AND EVEN PHYSICAL O INTRUDERS TO YOUR SYSTEM SO THE ADAPT OF IMIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS ITS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO SHOW UP AT THE SITE OF INVASION OR INFECTION OR INFLAMMATION IT'S CALLED THERE BY VARIOUS O VARIOUS CUES INCLUDING THE SIDO KINDS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT ACTUALLY ATTACHES TO AND CREATES A SORT OF A AN IMPRINT OF THE SHAPE OF WHATEVER INVADER HAPPENS TO BE THERE SO IF THAT A PARTICULAR IN INVADING BACTERIOR VIRUS HAS A CONTOUR THAT'S CONORIPPLED OR CON O SPICY OR OF WHATEVER SHAPE IT HAPPENS TO HAVE IT CREATES AN IMPRINT OF THAT AND THEN USING THAT IMPRINT IN CONCERT WITH SOME OTHER CELLS CREATES ANTIBODIES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO RECOGNIZE THAT INVADER SHOULD THE BODY EVER HAVE THAT INVADER INSIDE OF IT AGAIN NOW THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND IN MANY WAYS IT CREATES A MEMORY OF A PRIOR INFECTION SO THAT THESE ANTIBODIES CAN BE MADE ANY TIME THAT SAME INVADER COMES BACK AGAIN I AND SO THIS IS THE BASIS OF WHAT WE CALL IMMUNITY THIS IS THE BASIS OF WHAT WE CALL IT AN INHANCEDABILITY TO COMBAT CERTAIN TYPES OF INFECTI ONS ND IT'S REALLY A WONDERFUL AND I MEAN JUST A CAN EVEN A STATE HOW INCREDIBLE THIS REALLY IS THAT ALL OF OUR BODIES HAVE THIS CAPACITY RIGHT WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED LUCASITES THESE ARE ESSENTUALLY WHITE BLOOD CELLS WE HAVE RED BLOOD CELLS AND WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND THEY BOTH ARE DERIVED FROM THE SAME TYPE OF ORIGIN CELLITS US A STEMSO WHEN U HEAR STEM CELLS STEM CELL JUST MEANS A ASELL THAT CAN BECOME MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF OTHER CELLS A WE SOMETIMES HEARE ABOUT STEM CELLS A IN TERMS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING INGECTIONS OF STEM CELLS ER THE POTENTIAL THERAPUTIC A AFFECTS OF A OR POTENTIAL OF STM CELLS BUT WE ALL HARBOR CERTAIN STEM CELLS WITHIN US AS WELL THAT CAN BECOME LOTS OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF STEM CELL WHICH IS THE HIMOPOETIC STEM CELL WHICH CAN GIVE RISE TO RED BLOOD CELLS AND WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND IN GENERAL THESE RESIDE IN THE MARROW AT LEAST IN IN ADULTS A SO IN OR BONE MARROW WE HAVE THIS ABILITY TO MAKE CERTAIN CELLS THAT CAN GO OUT WHEN THEY ARE CALLED OUT CHEMICALLY THEY CALLED OUT TO CITES AND INFECTION AND CREATE ANTOBODIES AND THEN MAINTAIN THOSE ANTIBODIES IN OUR SYSTEM OR HAVE A MEMORY OF THAT PARTICULAR INFECTION SO THAT IF THE INFECTION COMES BACK AGAIN WE CAN KILL IT OFF IMMEDIATELY AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THESE A MULTIPLE STAGES OF FIRST THE INNATE RESPONSE THAN THE ADAPT IVE RESPONSE TAKING SOME TIME THERE ARE LOT MORE GETAILS TO THE ADAPT OF MUN SYSTEM BUT I JUST WANT TO AND BESIZA A FEW POINTS THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT A FIRST OF ALL THE NAME OF THE ANTIBODIES THAT ARE CREATED SOMETIMES COME IN THE FORM OF IG M AND IG G THINGS THAT SORT THIS IS INTO A FULL DEEP DIVE IMMUNOLOGY CLASS BUT IG STANDS FOR IMMUNIGLOBULENT OC SO THE IMMUNIGLOBULENS ARE PART OF THE ADAPT OFE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND IN CREATING IN A BODIES IF YOU HEAR IG M THE IG M IS THE FIRST OF THE ADAPT IVE IMMUNE RESPONSES AND IT TENDS TO COME ON EARLIOR SO SOMEBODY IS A MUNOPOSITIVE FOR IG M FOR A PARTICULAR TYPE OF VIRAL OR BACTERIAL INVADER THAT MEANS THAT IT WAS A FAIRLY RECENT INFECTION LATER ONE CREATES THE ADAPT IN MUNE SYSTEM I SHOULD SAY CREATES AND IG G WHICH IS THE MORE STABLE FORM OF THE SPECIFIC ANTIBODY THAT 'S GOING TO RECOGNIZE A GIVEN INVADER SO IG G TENDS TO COME UP A LOBIT LADER SO JUST TO RECAP SOME THING GETS INTO YOUR SYSTEM THROUGH YOUR EYES THROUGH SOME WHOLE IN YOUR  IN YOUR SKIN A CAUHT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH A SECXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES COME IN THROUGH THE MUCUS MEMBRANES THAT ARE ON THE GENITALIA OR IN THE GENITALIA SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE AIRBORN DISEASE GETS INTO THE MUCUS SOMEHOW GETS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM THEN THERE'S THE INNATE RESPONSE WHICH IS A MORE GENERAL RESPONSE OF TRYING TO CONTAIN AND COM BAT THE INFECTION OR INVADER AND THEN THE ADAPT OFE RESPONSE IS THE ONE THAT GENERATES THE ANTIBODY'S FIRST THE IGEEM RESPONSE THE MUNUGA GLOBULANE M RESPONSE AND THEN THE IMIMMUNIO GLOBULANE GE RESPONSE IG G RESPONSE SO HOW DO WE KEEP THESE THREE BARRIERS OR THESE THREE DEFENSESYSTEMS TO INFECTION TOONED UP WELL LEAVING ASIDE THE LIST OF THINGS THAT I MENTION BEFORE THAT GENERALLY ENHANCES THEIR FUNCTION THINGS LIKE SLEEP AND SUNLIGHT AND GOOD NUTRICION ET CETERA THAT THE SORT OF GENERIC THINGS FOR GOOD HEALTH ONE OF THE KEY WAYS WE CAN DO THAT IS TO KEEP THAT MUCUS LINING IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL THE THE MUCUS LINING NEEDS TO TURN OVER QUITE OFTEN AND IT NEEDS TO BE THE CORRECT CHEMISTRY TO BE A TRAP FOR THE BAD STUFF AND FOR IT TO BE PERMIABLE TO THE GOOD STUFF TO THE NUTRIENCS THAT WE NEED AND IT IS NOW VERY CLEAR FROM HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF STUDIES THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY SO CALLED MICROBIOM THE MICROBIOM BEING THESE LITTL BACTERIAL ORGANISMS THAT ARE GOOD FOR US THAT LIVE ALL ALONG ARE MUCUS PATHWAYS AND EVEN IN OUR EYES NOW JUST TO BE REALLY CLEAR IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE GUT MICROBIOM WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MICROBIOM IN OUR EYES WE HAVE ONE THAT SPECIFIC TO OUR MOUTH WE HAVE A NASAL SPECIFIC MICROBIOM THERE'S ONE ALL ALONG THE GUT AND THE SPECIES OF MICROBIODA THAT LIVE ALL ALONG THE DIGESTIVE TRACT DIFFER FROM THE MOUTH TO THE THROAT TO THE STOMACH IN TESTINS INTO THE RACTUM IT'S WELL ESTABLISH THAT THERE ARE HEALTHY MICROBIODA THAT LIVE ALL ALONG THAT LENGTHEND THEY DIFFER ALONG THAT LENGTH THERE IS ALSO A EURETHRAL MICROBIOTA AND THERE'S A BAGENAL MICROBIOTA THAT PROMOTES HEALTH OF THAT ENVIRONMENTS IS WEALTH SO HOW IS IT THAT ONE CAN MAINTAIN THE HEALTHY MICROBIODA AND NOT FAVOR GROWTH OF HARMFUL BACTERIA OR ALLOW THAT MUCUS LINING TO BECOME TOO PERMEABLE TO THE BAD STUFF THAT CAN COME IN FROM THE ENVIRONMENT WELL AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE ARE THREE MAINWAYS TO DO THAT THE FIRST TO ARE PURELY STRUCTURAL AND MECHANICAL IT'S VERY CLEAR NOW FROM WORK SOME OF WHICH WAS DONE AT STAMFORD BUT ELSEWHERE AS WELL THAT THE NASAL MICROBIOM IS PARTICULARLY GOOD AT SCRUBBING BACTERIA AT PREVENTING CERTAIN TYPES OF INFECTION SO THIS IS A REMINDER THAT WHENEVER POSSIBLE UNLESS EATING OR SPEAKING YOU WANT TO BE NASAL BREATHING NOT BREATHING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH YOUR NOSE IS A MUCH BETTER FILTER FOR VIRUSES IN BACTERIA THAN IS YOUR MOUTH THE MOUTH CONTAINS CERTAIN STRUCTURAL FEATURES EVEN ORGANS AND SELTYPES THAT CAN A PROTECT AGAINST IN COMING INFECTION BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A MOUTH BREATHER FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND THERE'S A TERRIFIC BOOK CALLED JAWS A HIDDEN EPIDEMIC UM WHICH AS WRITTEN BY MICHOLECANDRACAL N AND PAUL EARLIC AT STAMFORD AND STAMFORD MEDICINE WITH A FORWARD BY JER DIAMOND AND ROBERT ZUPOLSKY SO IT'S REALLY A LOT OF HEAVY HITTERS ON THAT BOOK THAT TALKS ABOUT THE INCREASE IN INFECTION THAT ONE GETS WHEN BREATHING THROUGH THE MOUTH AS OPPOSED TO THE NOSE NOW OF COURSE DURING HARD EXERCISE ONE BREATS THROUGH THE MOUTH THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD WHEN ONE IS EATING OR SPEAKING THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD AT ALL GUESS IT SPEND WHAT YOURE SAYING THE JOKE BUT IN GENERAL WHEN POSSIBLE YOU WANT TO BE BREATHING THROUGH YUR NOSE MANY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE BREATHING THROUGH THEIR NOSE BECAUSE OF SO CALLED DEVIATED SEPTUMS OR CHRONICALLY COLLAPSED SCINESCES THE BEST WAY TO DILATE THOSE SCINESCES ACTUALLY TO BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE SO IT CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT THERE IS SOME A PLASTICITY TO THE SCINESSES AND SO BE A NOSEBREATHE OR NOT A MOUTH BREATHER YOU WILL COMBAT MORE OF THE INFECTIONS THAT YOU ARE CONSTANTLY CONFRONTED WITH I SHOULD MENTION THAT WE ARE ALWAYS BOMBARDED WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF BACTERIA VIRUSES AND PARASITES IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THAT THE GOAL OF COURSES TO IN REINFORCE YOUR MUNE SYSTEM O YOU CAN KEEP THESE THINGS AT BAY AND NOT GET SICK THERE'S ACTUALY A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN SELL REPORT SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THAT SHOWED THAT THE NASAL MICROBIOM IT HAS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF MICROBIODA THAT AR GOOD AT FIGHTING OFF INFECTION THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF NASAL BREATHING AND THE NASAL MICROBIOM YET BUT OXYGENATION OF THAT ENVIRONMENT BY BREATHING THROUGH YOUR NOSE TURNS OUT TO BE QUITE IMPORTANT OVER ALL FOR ENHANCING IT AS A FILTER SO DON'T JUST THINK OF YOUR NOSE AS SOMETHING TO SMELL FOODS AND TO BRING IN AIR ITS ALSO AN ACTIVE FILTER FOR THINGS THAT COULD INVADE YOU THE OTHER WAY TO TRYIND KEEP OUT BAD THINGS AND TO AVOID GETTING SICK IS THE ADVICE THAT YOUR MOTHER AND CERTAINLY MY MOTHER I GAVE ME WHICH IS TO NOT TOUCH YOUR EYES AFTER TOUCHING OTHER PEOPLE OR TOUCHING OTHER SURFACES AND AS I MENTION EARLIER WE TEND TO DO THIS SUBCONSCIOUSLY AND THAT BUT THE REASON TO AVOID DOING THAT IS THE EYES ARE A PRIMARY ENTRY POINT FOR A LOT OF BACTERI ENVIRUSES YOU'RE CONSTANTLY LUBRICATING THE SURFACE OF YOUR EYES WITH THE SOCOLACRIMAL GLANDS AND TEARS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT IF YOU'VE EVER NOWICE WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU HAVE SOME SLEEP IN YOUR EYES YOUTHA CON A CRUSTY STUFF IN THE CORNERS OF YOUR EYES ER ON YOUR EYELASHES THAT SLEEP THAT CROSSED ARE ACTUALLY DEAD BACTERIA THAT YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY BATTLED DURING THE NIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THAT IS IT'S NOT THE ACCUMULATION OF SOME HEALTHY TISSUE IT'S THE ACCUMULATION OF THAT YOUR HEALTHY NUCAS MEMBRAINS AND TEARS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY COMBATING THOSE BACTERIA SO I KNOW THAT SOUNDS A LITLE BIT GROSE BUT THAT'S WHAT THAT IS O YOUR WIPING AWAY THE A CASUALTY IS OF A BATTLE THAT YOU FOUGHT AT NIGHT SO DURING THE DAYTIME YOU DON'T WANT TO INTRODUCE VIRUISES AN THINGS TO TO YOUR EYES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IT IS A PRIMARY SIDE OF ENTRY THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WEAR GOGGLES IN SURGICAL UNITS AND THINGS THAT SORT TO TRY TO AVOID GETTING A THINGS INTO THEIR EYES VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN THE THIRD WAY TO KEEP A HEALTHY LINE OF DEFENCE A FOR YOUR A ENTIRE MUCUS TRACT IS TO ENHANCE THE PROLIFERATION OF GOOD GOT MICROBIODA THE BEST WAY TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF T EOR GOT MI CROBIOM AND THE MUCUS LINING THAT SERVICES THIS PROTECTIVE LAYER ALL ALONG YOURBODY IS TO INJEST TWO TO FOUR SERVINGS TO DAY OF FORMENTED FOODS LOW SUGAR FORMENTED FOODS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE A BUNCH OF TIMES ON THE PODCAST BUT THESE ARE DATA FROM A MY COLLIC JUST IN SONINBURG LAV AT STAMFORD MED AND THERE I JUST WIPED MY EYES YET YOU GOT ME A BUT THAT A PAPER PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL CELL WHICH IS A ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR JOURNAL A REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE EAT FERMENTED FOODS TWO TO FOUR SERVINGS PER DAY IT HELPS REDUCE THE ACTIVITY OF CERTAIN SITA KINDS NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE RIGHT SELLS MAKE SIDEO KINDS TO CALL OUT HELP ME HELP ME IT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF A SITA KINDS THE SO CALLED INFLAMATOME NOW THAT DOESN'T RENDER THOSE SELLS MORE VULNERABLE THE REASON THEY SAW A REDUCTION IN A ILE SIX AND IL ONE AND SOME OF THESE OTHER SUDA KINDS IS BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A HEALTHY GOT MICROBIOM THERE ARE FEWER CELLS IN THE BODY BEING INFECTED FROM OUTSIDE INFECTIONS AND THEREFORE LESS OF A REASON FOR SELLS TO BE CRYING OUT HELP BECAUSE THEY ARE THRIVING NOT SUFFERING SO DON'T WIPE YOUR EYES KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN EVERY ONE TELLS YOU THAT RIGHT KEEP YOUR HANDSCLING DON'T WIPE YOUR EYES BE IN NO NASELBREATHE OR NOT A MOUTH BREATHER UNLESS YOUR SPEAKING EXERCISING R EATING AND KEEP A HEALTHY GOT MY CROBIOM BY EATING TWO TOFOUR SERVINGS TO DAY OF QUALITY LOW SUGAR FORMENTED FOODS THINGS LIKE SOUR CROUT THINGS LIKE NOTO IF A IF YOU CAN ACCESS THAT I'VE TRY TO BEFOR ITS INTERESTING A SOR OF AN ACQUIRED TASTE A KIMCHEE PICKLES AGAIN LOW SUGAR SOURCES ARE GOING TO BE A THE SOURCES THAT ARE GOING TO BE A MOST AFFECTIVE FOR THIS SO NOW YOUR ARMED WITH THREE WAYS TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF YOUR MUNE SYSTEM AND COMBAT INFECTION THAT IS I LIKE TO THINK SEPARATE FROM THE TYPICAL TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT YOU GET SUCH AS YOU NONT GET GOOD SLEEP Y GOOD NUTRITION GOOD SOCIAL CONNECTION ET CETERA ALL THAT STUFF STIL HOLDS TRUE BUT THESE THREE OTHER POINTS THIN CAN REALLY MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF BOLSTERING THE AMUNE SYSTEM YOURIMIAN SYSTEM I DO ONE TO MENTION BECAUSE THESE NAMES ARE GOING TO COME UP A SEVERAL TIMES DURING THIS EPISODE THAT WHILE INTERLUCANS LIKE ILE SIX AND IOL WHEN IN ENCOURAGE INFLAMMATION THEY ARE THESE HELP ME SIGNALS THAT CALL IN SELLS TO A GOBBLE UP INVADERS THERE ARE SOME INTERLUCANS THAT ARE ANTI INFLAMMATORY AND THE ONE THAT I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE IT WILL COME UP AGAIN IN A LITTLE BIT IS INTERLUCAN TEN SO NOT ALL OF THE IEL IN CERTAIN NUMBER NOT ALL OF THE INTERLUCANS ARE INFLAMMATORY SOME ARE ANTI IN FLAMMATORY SUT'S IMPORTANT POINT TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE GO FORWARD NEXT STUD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S CALLED SICKNESS BEHAVIOR AND INDEED THERE IS A CATEGORY OF BEHAVIOR THAT WE CALL SICKNESS BEHAVIOR THAT IS VERY INFORMATIVE AS TO THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO AVOID GETTING SICK NOW THIS NOTION OF SICKNESS BEHAVIOR GOES BACK SEVERAL DECADES OR MORE AND IT'S A VERY INTERESTING WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FUNCTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS IT BRIDGES US FROM THIS THING THAT WERE CALLING UMUNE SYSTEM WHERE IT'S YOU KNOW TECELLS AND BECELLS AND SITE O KINDS AND LUCASITES AND IT STARTS TAKING US INTO THE REALM OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BECAUSE OF COURSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROLS BEHAVIOR SO SICKNESS BEHAVIOR IS A SWEET OF RESPONSES THAT WE TEND TO ALL UNDERGO WHEN WE ARE FEELING SICK SO THIS IS GOING TO VARY FROM PERSON TO PERSON BUT THERE SOME GENERAL CATEGORIES OF THINGS THAT WE ALL DO AND HAPPENED ALL OF US AFTER WE ARE WOUNDED OR SICK OR DEALING WITHIN INFECTION OF ANY KIND AND BY EXAMINING SICKNESS BEHAVIOR IN SOME DETAIL IT CAN BE REALLY INFORMATIVE AS TO ROUTES THAT WE CAN TAKE TO HELTH SO THE MAIN THING ABOUT SICKNESS BEHAVIOR IS THAT IT TENDS TO INVOLVE A SLOWING OF OUR USUAL LEVELS OF ACTIVITY PEOPLE START TO FEEL LETHARGIC OR THEY FEEL LIKE THE ACTIVITIES THAT PREVIOUSLY THEY COULD DO WITH RELATIVE EASE ARE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM OR SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMING THE OTHER THING YOU START TO SEE IS THAT PEOPLE AND ANIMALS BY THE WAY STOP GROOMING THEY STOP TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES NOT NECESSARILY STOP SHOWERING ALTHOUGH OFTENTIMES THAT'S THE CASE BUT THEY WILL STOP A DOING THEIR HAIR THEY'LL STOP PUTTING ON MAKE UP A YOU KNOW DEPENDINGON WHETHER NOT THEY DID THAT BEFORE THEY MIGHT STOP ANIMALS WILL STOP LICKING AND GROOMING THEMSELVES PEOPLE WILL STOP TAKING CARE OF THEIR COSMETIC APPEARANCE NOW IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE HOW THEY LOOK WHEN THEY'RE SICK IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S THIS OVERALL SUPPRESSION OF CERTAIN KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND AN ENHANCEMENT OF OTHER KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SICKNESS BEHAVIOR IS ACTUALLY A MODIVATED STATE IT'S A STATE THAT'S DESIGN TO ACCOMPLISH CERTAIN THINGS ONE OF THE OTHER FEATURES OF SICKNESS BEHAVIOR ANDDITION OF BEING LETHARGIC LOSS OF GROOMING WILL BE A LOSS OF APPETITE AND OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GREAT APPETITE NORMALLY JUST WON'T FEEL HUNGRY AT ALL AND THER' SEVERAL THEORIES AS TO WHY THIS WOULD BE ONE PROMINENT IDEA IN THE LITERATURE IS THAT IT'S TO DISCOURAGE VOMITING AND DIARRHOEA WHICH OF COURSE IT CAN BE INFECTIOUS TO OTHER PEOPLE SO THAT'S A THEORY I I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S EVER BEEN TESTED DIRECTLY BUT THAT'S ONE IDEA THE OTHER IDEAS THAT ITS SIMPLY TO HARBOR MORE RESOURCES FORSAKE OF REPAIR AND I WANT A TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WERE WE ARE ALL TOLD TO GET EXTRA SLEEP WHEN WE AREN'T FEELING WELL OR TO REST BUT JUST LIKE ANY GOOD TWO OR THREE YEAR OLD CONSTANTLY ASKS WHY WHY GOOD SCIENTISTS GOOD A PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HEALTH INFORMATION SHOULD ALWAYS BE ASKING WHY WHY SHOULD I GET MORE SLEE WHAT HAPPENS IN SLEEP THAT I SHOULD GET MORE SLEEP WHEN I AM SICK WHY SHOULDN'T I JUST PUSH THROUGH THIS AND THERE R COUPLE REASONS FOR THIS OF THAE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE LITERATURE THE FIRST IS THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING USEFUL ABOUT SLOWING CIRCULATION WHEN WE ARE ILL ONE IDEA THAT HAS SOME DATED TO SUPPORT IT IS THAT WHEN WE SLOW OUR CIRCULATION OUR BLOOD CIRCULATION YON SO NOT RUNNING AROUND SO MUCH OR RUNNING AT ALL BUT RATHER AM LYING DOWN GETTING EXTRA REST MAY BE SLEEPING MAYBE EVEN JUST REMAINING STILL IS THAT THE LEMPHATIC SYSTEM WHICH CARRIES A LOT OF THE IMMUNERELATED CELLS AND FLUIDS IS ABLE TO RAMP UP ITS LEVELS OF ACTIVITY SO IT IS INTERESTING RIGHT IT SO REDUCING CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD BUT INCREASING CIRCULATION OF THE LIMPHATIC SYSTEM YOU'VE ALT A PROBABLY BEEN FAMILIAR WITH A THE LEMPHATIC SYSTEM WHEN YOUR COMBATING AN INFECTION YOUR YOUR LIMPH NOTES CAN GET SORE YOU GT LIMPNETS BEHIND YOUR EARS IN YOUR GROWING YOUR ARMPITS AROUND YOUR THROAT AROUND YOUR ON YOAR YOUR THIROID NIN YOUR THROAT ET CETERA SO THAT'S THE OTHER REASON NOW SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET SICK GET A PSYCHOLOGICALLY GO INTO A VERY VULNERABLE STATE WHERE THEY REALLY REALLY WANT PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM YOUR PROBABLY WITNESS THIS AM OR YOU FEEL THIS WAY YOURSELF ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT RESPONSE THEY REALLY WANT TO BE TAKING CARE OF NOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM AN ADAPTIVE PERSPECTIVE THIS MAKES SENSE RIGHT A MEMBER OF OUR SPECIES IS ILL AND THEY MORE OR LESS WILL CRY OUT FOR HELP A IN ONE FORMER ANOTHER TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THEIR SPECIES TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND OF COURSE THIS WILL BE ESPECIALLY APPARENT IN CASES WHERE PEOPLE ARE YOUNG ENOUGH OR INCAPACITATED ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY GET RESOURCES ON THEIR OWN  YOU'VE EVER BEEN REALLY SICK JUST GETTNG UP AND GOING TO THE FRIDGE OR TO THE REST ROOM CAN BE CAN FEEL LIKE A A A MONUMENTAL TASK SO ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE REPORT OR DESCRIBE SEEKING OF HELP AND SUPPORT WHEN THEY ARE SICK BUT YOU COULD ALSO IMAGINE HOW THIS WOULD BE A VERY NON ADAPTIVE RESPONSE BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE OPPORTUNITY IS SPREAD INFECTION TO THE CARETAKER SO THAT'S AN INTERESTING CONSIDERATION ANOTHER FIFTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE THE OPPOSITE RESPONSE WHEN THEY'RE SICK SO SOMEHOW REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY WERE PRIOR TO GETTING ILL THE SICKNESS BEHAVIOR THAT'S ENGAGED BY THESE NORAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THEY ARE INDEED NERAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN CREATE A STAY AWAY FROM ME I DON'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE I DON'T WANT TO BE TAKING CARE OF RIGHT IT'S NOT STUBBORNNESS IT'S A IT'S LITERALLY A A LACK OF INTEREST OR A DISINTEREST IN SOCIAL CONNECTION WHEN ONE IS SICK AND YOU SEE THIS IN ANIMALS TOO SOME ANIMALS WILL SEEK OUT OTHER MEMBERS OF THEIR SPECIES OTHERS LIKE MY UNFORTUNATELY NOW PASSE A PASTAWAY BULLDOG COSTELLA WHEN HE WAS SICK I ALWAYS KNEW BECAUSE HE WOULD GO ROUND THE BACK O THE HOUSE AND HE WOULD JUST HIDE THERE HE WANT WOULD JUST TAKE HIMSELF AWAY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE TAKIN CARE OF AND I IT WAS JUST A NATURAL RESPONSE TOM I DON'T THINK HE WAS TRUN AND PREVENT ME FROM GETTING WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HE HAD SO IF EVER SOMEBODY DOESN'T WANT TO BE TAKING CARE OF ER IF THEY DO WONT TO BE TAKING CARE OF REALIZE THAT PEOPLE TEND TO FALL INTO THESE TWO BINS NATURALLY IN ANIMALS TEND TO FALL INTO THESE BINS REGARDLESS OF WHAT SPECIES THEY ARE ITS ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY AND AGAIN THE SICKNESS BEHAVIOR IS A MODIVATED STATE ITS DESIGN TO SLOW CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD INCREASE CIRCULATION OF THE LIMPH AND THE OTHER KILLER CELLS IN THE BODY REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF INFECTING OTHERS BY REDUCING ITS THOUGHT DIARHEUNVOMIT BUT ALSO BREATHING ON OTHERS INTERACTING WITH OTHERS AND IN SOME CASES IT WILL ACTIVATE THIS U I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT A REGRESS STATE BUT MANY PEOPLE FEEL SOMEWHAT MORE A IF THERE A IF THEY ARE ADULTS THEY FEEL MORE CHILD LIKE WHEN THEY ARE ILL AND THEY WANT TO BE TAKIN CARE OF VERY BADLY SOME OF IT MIGHT BE LEARNED SOME OF IT UM MIGHT BE INNATE WE DON'T KNOW BUT THE SICKNESS BEHAVIOR IS VERY INTERESTING FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS FIRST OF ALL IT MIMICS ANOTHER STATE THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE NERROW SCIENCE LITERATURE WHICH IS MAJOR DEPRESSION AND IN BOTH SICK INDIVIDUALS SICK FROM BACTERIAL VIRAL INFECTION END IN PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT THEIARE ARE ROBUST INCREASES IN THE LEVELS OF INTERLUCAN SICKS AND TUMERNECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA SO THERE IS AN IDEA NOW CIRCULATING THAT DEPRESSION INVOLVES THESE INFLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS BEING VERY ACTIVE AND WE KNOW THAT ILLNESS INVOLVES INFLAMMATORY SIDE O KINCE BEING VERY ACTIVE SO F YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN MAJOR DEPRESSION AND BEING SICK OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO POINT US IN A DIRECTION OF INTERVENTIONS THAT COULD HELP US EITHER PREVENT ILLNESS OR MOVE THROUGH ILLNESS MORE QUICKLY BUT AS WE HEAD IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE INDEED THAT'S THE CASE I JUST ONE EMPHASIZE THAT SICKNESS BEHAVIOR IS WHAT PROVIDES THIS BRIDGE BETWEEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND WHAT WILL SOON S HE ALSO IS THAT HEALTHY BEHAVIOR BEHAVIOR THAT ALLOWS US TO AVOID INFECTION ALSO POINTS TO A CLEAR BRIDGE BETWEEN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE IMUNE SYSTEM THAT IT ISN'T JUST THAT WE HAVE A BRAIN AND BODY IN OUR ORGANS THAN WE HAVE ANIMUNE SYSTEM THAT'S TRUE BUT THEIRE INTERACTING ALL THE TIME AND THIS IS GOING TO LEAD US TO A PLACE WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR AND NOT AT ALL SURPRISING HOW CERTAIN PATTERNS OF THINKING AND CERTAIN BEHAVIORS THAT WE CAN ELECT TO TAKE CAN HELP ENHANCE OUR IMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND VICE VERSA THERE R TWO OTHER FEATURS OF SICKNESS BEHAVIOR DEFINITELY WORTH POINTING OUT ONE IS A THEORY WHICH IS THAT THE REDUCED APPETITE IN PARTICULAR APPETITE FOR PROTINE RICH FOODS WHEN SICK IS THOUGHT TO BE AN ATTEMPT A SUBCONSCIOUS ATTEMPT OF THE ORGANISM TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF IRON THAT IT'S TAKING IN NOW TYPICALLY THE AMOUNT OF IRON IN TAKE UM THAT'S RECOMMENDED OR OR MORE OR LESS IS FOR MEN IT'S ABOUT EIGHT MILIGRAMS PER DAY A FOR WOMEN IT'S ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SEVEN MILIGRAMS PER DAY DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT THEIR PREGNANT LACTATING OR MENSTRATING ET CETERA THE RANGES CAN VERY A BUT AND INDEED IT'S TRUE THAT IF IRON LEVELS IN THE BLOOD GO TOO HIGH LIKE OVER YOU KNOW FORTY FIVE A YOU NOW MILIGRAMS PER DAY CAN BE VERY TOXIC TO THE SYSTEM BUT THE THEORY THAT'S PROMINENT IN THE BIOLOGY LITERATURE AN THE HEALTH LITERATURE IS THAT THE REDUCTION IN APPETITE IS ACTION ATTEMPT TO REDUCE IRON IN TAKE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE MANY BACTERIA AND OTHER FORMS OF INFECTION SEEM TO THRIVE WHEN LEVELS OF IRON IN THE BLOOD ARE HIGH I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY ONE TAKE THIS TO EXTREME AND SUDDENLY DO AN IRON DEPRIVATION DIET IN ORDER TO A TO GET WELL BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY THAT I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION BECAUSE IT MAKES GOOD SENSE IRON IS ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO HUMOGLOBAN AND RED BLOOD SELLS IN THE BLOODSTREAM NORMALLY THAT CAN HELP US A QUITE A LOT OM IT'S ALSO IN MUSCLE I SHOULD MENTION THAT IRON CONLD BE A SEQUESTERED INTO MUSCLE AND IRON SERVES THE LOT OF IMPORTANT HEALTH PROMOTING ROLLS BUT BY REDUCING APPETITE AND THEREBY REDUCING IRON IN TAKE IT DOES REDUCE THE CAPACITY OF CERTAIN THINGS INCLUDING INFECTIONS TO TRAVEL IN CERTAIN COMPARTMENTS WITHIN THE BODY SO AGAIN THAT'S JUST THEORY BUT I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH NOT HAVING AN APPETITE WHEN YOUARE SICK THE OTHER THING THAT'S VERY TYPICAL OF PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION IS LOSS OF APPETITE NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN LOSS OF APPETITES O HERE AGAIN WE HAVE LOSS OF APPETITE IND SICKNESS BEHAVIOUR LOSS OF APPETITE IN MAJOR DEPRESTION AND PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY ONE OF THE MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF SICKNESS BEHAVIOR AND MAJOR DEPRESSION THAT MAP MORE OR LESS ON TO ONE ANOTHER IS LOSS OF OF LIBIDO OR INTEREST NOT JUST IN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS BUT IN SECS AN REPRODUCTION AND SO AGAIN IF YOU THINK ABOUT SICKNESS BEHAVIOR IN DEPRESTION THEY ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR O CASE SO SICKNESS BEHAVIOR AND MAJOR DEPRESSION HAVE CERTAIN COOR FEATURES IN COMMON WE NEED TO THEREFORE ASK OURSELVES WHY AND HOW DOES BEING SICK INFLUENCE THE WAY THAT WE THINK AND PERCEIVE OUR ENVIRONMENT AND INPACT OUR APPETITE WHETHER NOT WE WANT TO BE CARED FOR MORE OR CARED FOR LESS AGAIN PEOPLE TEND TO DIVERGE INTO TWO DIFFERENT BINS THERE AND BELIEVE OR NOT THE PATHWAY FOR THIS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED WHEN WE HAVE AN INFECTION SOME PLACE IN OUR BODY AND IT COULD BE UP IN OUR HEAD YOU KNOW CON BE A SIGNESS INFECTION COULD BE AN EAR INFECTION OR I SHOULD AL SOMENSION MANY OF THESE SAME MECHANISMS CAN ALSO BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF A WOUND OR AN INJURY TO THE BODY Y BACK A Y BACK INJURY OR A SLIP DISK OR  GUESS IT'S CALLED A HERNEATED DISK IS IS THE WAY THAT YOU HEAR DESCRIBED WHEN WE HAVE THAT WE CAN BE KIND OF IRRITABLE WE DON'T WANT TO DO CERTAIN THINGS WHEN WE JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE THINGS ARE HARDER HOW WHY WELL THERE'S A KNOWN PATHWAY WHICH IS THE SO CALLED VAGUEST NERVE THAT CONNECTS THE BODY IN THE BRAIN SIGNALS TO PARTICULAR BRAIN SIDES TO ENGAGE THIS CATEGORY OF MOTIVATIONAL STATE THAT WE CALL SICKNESS BEHAVIOR MANY OF YOU OF PROBABLY HEARD OF THE VAGUEST V A G U S VAGUS THE VAGUEST NERVE IS A VERY EXTENSIVE NERVE PATHWAYS THE TENTH CRANIAL NERVE COMES OUT OF THE BACK OF THE THE BRAINSTEM HADS INTO THE BODY AND AND BRANCHES OUT EXTENSIVELY TO INERVATE OR CONNECT TO MANY OF OUR ORGANS INCLUDINGOUR LUNGS OUR HEART ARE GOT ET CETERA AND ALL OF THOSE ORGANS ARE ABLE ALSO TO SEND NERAL SIGNALS BACK UP TO THE BRAIN WE SOMETIMES HEAR OF THE VAGUEST AS THE ROUT TO CALMING OURSELVES DOWN UNFORTUNATELY THAT MORE LESS A MYTH THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW WIT GOT PROPAGATED YOU HAVE LOTS OF IFFEREN PATHWAYS IN THE VAGUUS USUALLY VAGUAL STIMULATION ACTUALLY CREATES MORE AROUSAL AND ALERTNESS ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAVE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS BUT THERE H'VE NOW BEEN MANY STUDIES OF THE VAGUUST IN VARIOUST CONTECTS INCLUDING IN SICKNESS BEHAVIOR AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE VAGUEST NERVE IS THE FAST PATHWAY BY WHICH AN INFECTION IN THE BODY IS SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN TO A PARTICULAR LOCATION THE BRAIN CALL THE HYPOTHALMUS WHICH HARBORS A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF NURONS NURONS FOR INSTANCE IN THE PREOPTIC AREA THAT INCREASE BODY TEMPERATURE AND FEVER I THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS TO INCREASE BODY TEMPERATURE IN ORDER TO IT'S THE BODY'S ATTEMPTD TO KILL OFF THIS INVADER BECAUSE MANY VYRUSES AND MANY BACTERIA DON'T SURVIVE WELL AT ELEVATED HEAT THAT'S THE FUNCTION OF A FEVER OF FEVER ACTUALLY AS A FUNCTIONAL ROLL SO IN A BIOLOGY WE LIKE COMPLICATE WORDS SO WE CALL ANYTHING THAT INCREASES BODY TEMPERATURE OR CREATES A FEVER A PYROGIN MANY YEARS AGO A IN MY UNDERGRADUAT YEARS I WAS WORKING ON PYROGANS INJECTING SOME THNG CALL LIPY POLLY SACARIDE INTO OM THE BELLY WHICH THEN GIVES YOU A FEVER THE WAY IT DOES THAT IS IS ELPIAS CAUSES AN INFLAMMATION RESPONSE IN THE GUT THE GUT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING THE STOMACH SELS DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING SO THEY JUST START SECRETING THE ISLE SIX THE A ISLE ONE ALTHOUGH SIDT OF KINDS THE KILLER SELLS MIGRATE INTO THE GUT THAT'S WHAY YOU SOMETIMES GET A STOMACH ACH WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL WELL YOU HAVE A FLUE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT A NERAL SIGNAL ELECTRICAL SIGNALS GET SENT UP TO THE HYPOTHELMUS THE HYPOTHALMUS SAYS UP I DON'T KNO WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE BUT THERE'S A SIGNAL SOMETHINGS GOING ON LAS JUST KEAT UP THE BODY WAS TO START COOKING WHATEVER IT IS OUT THERE OF COURSE YOU DN'T WNT FEVER TO GO TOO HIGH BECAUSE YOU CAN KILL BRAIN CELLS BUT YOU KNOW WITHIN A PARTICULAR RANGE THAT THE FEVER IS A A PFUNCTIONAL AND ADAPTIVE RESPONSE CASE OF YOUR TAKING DRUGS TO TRY ING LOWER THE FEVER THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S LIMITING THE RESPONSE THAT YOUR BODY IS CREATING IN ORDER TO TRY AND KILL OFF THAT INVADER AND AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT FEVER TO GO TOO HIGH YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO VERY DEPENDING ON AGE A YOYOU CAN LOOK UP ON LINE WITH THE WHAT THE RANGE TOLERABLE RANGES ARE FOR FEVER BUT WHEN YOU'R TRYING LOWER BODY TEMPERATURE WHEN YOU HAVE A FEVER UNLESS YOUR HEADING INTO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF OF HEATING UP THAT'S ICIALLY THE WRONG WAY TO TAKE YOUR SYSTEM IF YOU DO INDEED WANT TO KILL OFF THAT INVADER O CASE OF THE VAGUEST NERVE IS THE QUICK RESPONSE IT ALSO SENDS IM PUT TO AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT CHANGE YOUR PERCEPTION OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD ONE OF THE MOST A OBVIOUS OF THESE OBVIOUS ONCE I TELL IT TO YOU IS PHOTOPHOBIA RIGHT I LOVE BRIGHT SUNSHINE I LOVE BRIGHT LIGHTS WHEN I WANT TO BE ALERT WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OF LIGHT SENSITIVITY BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE SICK WHEN THERE'S AN INFLAMMATION RESPONSE IN THE BODY THEY FEEL LIKE BRIGHT LIGHTS ARE KIND OF AVERSIVE THEY GET WELL DESCRIBED CON A CLASSICAL PHOTOPHOBIA AND THAT'S MEDIATED BY A PATHWAY THAT GOES FROM YOUR IYE TOO AN AREA OF YOUR THALAMUS CALL THE ANTERIOR NUCLEUS OF OF THE PHALEMUS THIS IS WORK THAT WAS DONE BY CLIFFORED SAPER AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL A IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL WORK AND THEN FROM THERE UP TO THE OUTER LINING OF THE BRAIN WHICH IS THE MININGIS JUST OF ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN WHERE THE BRAIN STARTS TO INTERFACE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER A CONNECTIVE TISSUES WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THESE LATER IT CANNECTUALLY CREATE A PHOTOPHOBIA AND A HEADACHE WHEN ONE IS ILL SO HERE'S THE PATHWAY SOME IN SOME INVADER GETS INTO YOUR SYSTEM CAUSE YOU WIPED YOUR EYES OR GOT IN THROUGH YUR MOUTH YOU DN'T LISTEN T H YOUR MOTHER  GOT INTHROUGHYOUR EYES YOU'RE FEELING SICK SOMETHING'S GOING ON THERE YOU HAVE A STOMACH ACHE BECAUSE OF ALL THET IT INFLAMMATION THERE THE SIGNAL GOES UP FROM YOUR VAGUEST NERE YOUR HEATING UP WITH A FEVER YOU'VE GOT PHOTOPHOBIA BECAUSE YOU'VE ACTIVATED THIS PATHWAY BY WHICH WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE TOLERABLE LIGHT IS TRIGGERING THE THELAMIC NUCLEAS THEY INTER THALMUS THE THAT'S PROJECTING UP TO THE MININGIS YOU'VE GOT A HEADACHE IN RESPONSE TO LOOKING AT LIGHT IT'S BASELY TRIGGERING AN OVER ALL PATHWAY TO GET YOU TO GO INTO A QUIET DARK PLACE AND REST AND THE LAST ELEMENT I LIHTST TALK ABOUT IS THE REST THERE'S SOMETHING THAT GETS TRIGGERED FROM THE BODY TO THE BRAIN TO THE HYPOTHALMUS AND WE THINK WE KNOW WHICH HYPOTHELAMIC AREA IS IT'S THE SUPEROPTIC NUCLEUS WE THINK SUPEROPTIC CAUSE IT'S RIGHT ABOVE YOUR SO CALLED OPTICIASM IF YOU WANT TO LOOK UP WHERE THAT IS IT'S RIGHT ABOVE THE ROO FOR YOUR MOUTH AND THERE NUCLII THERE THAT PROMOTE THE DESIRE TO SLEEP EVEN DURING THE DA TIME WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE THE ACTIVE PHASE OF YOUR CIRCADIAN CYCLE NOW DAT IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS YOU'VE GOT MULTIBLE PATHWAYS THAT ARE SAYING AVOID LIGHT REDUCE YOUR AMOUNT OF BEHAVIOR HEAT UP ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE MAKING SICK THI THE SICKNESS BEHAVIOUR IN IT'S GOING FROM YOUR YOUR BODY TO YOUR MIND TO TO MAKE YOU DO THE RIGHT THING NOW THERE'S ALSO A SLOW PATHWAY THAT'S PURELY IMEDIATED BY THE BLOOD SO CALLED HUMORAL FACTORS NOT CAUSE THEIR FUNNY BUT HUMORAL FACTORS ARE FACTORS OF THE BLOOD AS YOU HAVE AN EFFECT AN INFECTION FOR MANY HOURS OR DAYS THE AMOUNT OF ISLE SICX AND ILE JAN AND TUMERNECROSIS FACTOR AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY SIDE O KINDS IS STARTING TO INCREASE SUCH THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT IN YOUR CIRCULATION GETS HIGH ENOUGH AND IS COMMUNICATED TO THE BRAIN AND IT TENDS TO ENTER THE BRAIN THROUGH A PARTICULAR TYPE OF TISSUE THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING CALL CORROID C H O OR O IDE COROID IS REALLY INTERESTING IT'S KIND OF THIS OF FLUFFY TISSUE THAT SITS IN YOUR VENTIGLES THE VENTCLES ARE THE SPACES IN YOUR BRAIN AND THE SPACES IN YOUR BRAIN HAVE WHAT'SCALLED CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID IN THEM TCEBROSPON FLUID CONTAINS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT THINGS BUT THE COROID STARTS RELEASING AND RESPONDING TO THESE SIDE OF KINDS A THE INFLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS AND THEN THE BRAIN ACTUALLY STARTS TO EXPERIENCE ALL SORTS OF CHANGES IN TERMS OF INFLAMMATION TO NURONS YOUR MEMORY TENDS TO GET POOR YOUR COGNITION TENDS TO GET POOR THESE ARE TRANSIENT THINGS MOST OFTEN THESE EVENTUALLY THESE THINGS WILL PASS BUT THIS IS DEEP INTO SICKNESS WHEN YOUR REALLY FEELING LOUDS YOU CAN'T READ YOU CAN'T WATCH A MOVE YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING SO IF YOU EVER GET SICK AND YOU JUST CAN'T BE BOTHERED BY ANYTHING IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD THAT FAST RESPONSE FROM THE BODY AND YOU'VE ALSO HAD THIS SLOWER RESPONSE WHERE YOU LITERALLY HAVE A SET OF TISSUES IN YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE SENDING OUT THESE THESE INFLAMMATORY SIGNALS ND NOW YOUR WHOLE BRAIN IS STARTING TO COPE WEREIS TRYING TO COPE WITH THIS INFACTION SYOU GOT A SLOW PATHWAY IN A FATPATHWAY THAT ALL SOUNDS REALLY TERRIBLE SO NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO TO REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING SICK AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO AS YOU START TO GET SICK AND ONCE YOUR SICK TO ACCELERATE THE HEALING PROCESS BY FLIPPING THE EQUATION UP UNTIL NOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW THE BODY ACTIVATE CERTAIN AREAS IN THE BRAIN TO CREATE SICKNESS BEHAVIOR THAT'S VERY MUCH LIKE DEPRESSION PROBABLY ALL FAMILIAR WITH THIS FROM ANY TIME HAD A COLD OR OR FLUE OR SOMETHING REALLY LOWSY OR AN INJURY NOW LET'S FLIP THE EQUATION AND ASK WHAT CAN WE DO WITH OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF OUR IMUNE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HEAL AND RECOVER FROM ILLNESS AND INJURY MORE QUICKLY SO LET' SAY YOU ARE IN THAT UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE OF WAKING UP ONE DAY OR COMING HOME AND YOU'VE GOT THAT TICKLE IN YOUR THROAT OR WHEN YOU BREATHE YOUR YOUR NASAL PASSAGES DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY YOU'VE GOT  BIT OF A HEAD ACHE YOUR FEELING KIND OF OFF WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO WE SHOULD ALL HYDRATE DRINK SOME WATER AND GO TO SLEEP RIGHT THAT'SWHAT WE'RE ALT WE ARE ALL TOLD BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY THINGS THAT YOU CAN ACTIVELY DO IN ORDER TO GET YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO DEPLOY AND MORE ROBUST RESPONSE AT THAT EARLY FAYS OF POTENTIAL INFECTION LET'S FOCUS FIRST ON THE REST COMPONENT YES OF COURSE WE ARE ALL TOLD THAT WE SHOULD TAKE A HOT SHOWER AND GO TO SLEEP YON GET NINE OR TEN HOURS OF SLEEP BUT THERE'S AN INTERESTING WAY OF LOOKING AT SLEEP SPECIFICALLY FOR IT'S ROLL IN ENHANCING THE IMUNE SYSTEM AND THERE'S A WONDERFUL REVIEW I I'L A PUT THE REVIEW IN THE CACTIONS THAT LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE LITERATURE SURROUNDING SLEEP THAT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT OCCURS INSUPPORT OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SO NORMALLY WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP WE HAVE SLOW WAVE SLEEP PREDOMINANTLY IN THE EARLY PHASE OF THE NIGHT AND THEN OVER TIME AS WE SLEEP LONGER LONGER WE GET MORE SO CALLED RAM RAPID IGH MOVEMENT SLEEP TALKED ALL ABOUT THIS ON THE EPISODES ON SLEEP COURSE YOU HAVE SLOW WAVE SLEEP IN REM SLEEP THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT ALWAYS BUT IT'S THE FRACTION OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP TO REM SLEEP THE SHIFTS AND THEY PERDIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ET CETERA THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE SLEEP ASSOCIATED WITH AN INFECTION IN PARTICULAR EARLY STAGE OF INFECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF SRATONAN IN THE BRAIN THAT EITHER THROUGH AN ADAPTIVE MECHANISM OR FOR WHATEVER REASON THE BRAIN THE NURONS IN THE BRAIN OF THE SO CALLED RAFE NUCLLY A START RELEASING MORE SERATONAN AND THAT THAT SERETONAN IN ITS RELATED PATHWAYS CAN HELP ENHANCE SOME OF THE IMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION THEY COULD COMBAT THE INFECTION THERE IS STORTING TO BE SOME DATA AND I EMPHASIZE STARTING BECAUSE IT'S NOT A VERY ROBUST LITERATURE YET LOOKING AT WHETHER NOT SUPPLEMENTING PRECURSERS TO SCERATONAN LIKE FIVE ACH TEEP HEEP ON WHICH CAN BE TAKEN IN O SUPPLEMENT FORM OR CONSUMING FOODS THAT INCREASE SERATONEAN NATURALLY SO THESE WOULD BE ANY FOODS THAT CONTAIN HIGH LEVELS OF TRIP TO PAN YOU CAN LOOK UP WITH THOSE AR SO WHITE TURKEY FOR INSTANCE A CERTAIN COPLEX CARBOHYDRATES CAN OFTEN BE RICH WITH TRIP TO FAN THAT CONSUMING THOSE FOODS CAN ENHANCE THE AMOUNT OF CERETONAN THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE BRAIN AND BLOOD AND THEREBY LEAD TO THE PARTICULAR QUALITY OF SLEEP THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE DEEP HEALING OR FOR WHEN I SAY DEEP HEALING I MEAN FOR A MORE ROBUST AND MUNE RESPONSE NOW AGAIN THOSE ARE ARE STILL EMERGING DATA WHAT IS VERY CLEAR HOWEVER IS THAT DURING SLEEP AND IN PARTICULAR DURING SLEEP THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE EARLY STAGE OF ANY KIND OF VIRAL OR BACTERIAL INFECTION THE SO CALLED GLIMPHATIC SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE ACTIVE THAN IT WOULD BE NORMALLY WHAT'S THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM IS ASHALY A RELATIVELY RECENT A DISCOVERY I MENTION LIMPH AND THE LIMPHATIC SYSTEM EARLIER THE GLIMPHATIC SYSTEM WITH A G IS A SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN BY WHICH DEBRI THAT ACCUMULATES THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT IN PARTICULAR DEBRI THAT ACCUMULATES UNDER CONDITIONS OF NARROW INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATION OF THE BODY IS CLEARED OUT OR IS WASHED OUT OF THE BRAIN AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THE RECOVERY FROM INFECTION OF ANY KIND AND IT'S NOW BECOMING CLEAR IS IMPORTANT FOR RECOVERY FROM DRAMATIC HEAD INJURY AND MAY BEVEN FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA SO THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM IS CAN BE THOUGHT OF MORLESS AS THE PLUMBING SYSTEM THAT RUNS THROUGH THE VENTRICALS BUT ALSO MAINLY A THROUGH THE LINING THAT SITS BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND AND THE SKULL IN SOME OF THE OTHER A TISSUES AND O THINGS OF THAT SORT THE CORROID IS INVOLVED AS WELL BRAIN IMAGING REVEALS THET GLEMPHATI SYSTEM IS VERY ACTIVE DURING DEEP SLEEP IN THOS THIS KIND OF WASH OUT OF THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM A NIGHT MAWARE OF SOME STUDIES THET WRONG GOING NOW WHERE AUGMENTING THE SERATONAN SYSTEM THROUGH EITHER SUPPLEMENTATION OF TRIPDOPHAN OR FIVE H T P OR EVEN CERETONE IN ITSELF THESE ARE LABORATORY STUDIES IS BEING LOOKED OUT FOR ITS CAPHACI TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CIRCULATION IN THE GLEMPHATI SYSTEM AND THE IDEAS THAT IT MIGHT AND A ONE UNDERSCORE MIGHT POTENTIALLY LEAD TO MORE RAPID RECOVERY FROM INJURY AND ILLNESS AND POTENTIALLY RAMP UP IF YOU WILL THE ACTIVITY OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SO IT ESSENTIALY IS AT RAMPING UP OF THE ACTIVITYOF THE MMUNE SYSTEM NOW REGARDLESS OF WEATHER OR NOT YOU DECIDE TO FOR INSTANCE SUPPLEMENT WITH FIVE H T P BEFOR SLEEP OR NOT I'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN A MOMENT THERE IS AWAY THAT YOU CAN INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCYS BECAUSE OF THE MECHANICS OF THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU ELEVATE YOUR HEELS BY ABOUT TWELVE DEGREES  DOES N HAVE TO BE EXACTLY TWELVE AS YOU SLEEP BY PUTTING MAY BE A ROLLED PILLOW OR TWO PILLOWS UNDERNEATH YOUR FEET BY HAVING THE HEAD BELOW YOUR LEGS IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S MORE GLEMPHATIC WASH OUT OR CLEARANCE DURING SLEEP AND THIS IS WITHOUT TAKING ANY COMPOUND TO ADJUST THE CERETONAN SYSTEM SO I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING WELL YES TAKE THE HOT SHOWER YES A GET INTO BED AND GO TO SLEEP BUT ELEVATE YOUR FEET TO TRY AND INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM SOME MIGHT EVEN CONSIDER THAT IF YOU HAVE TO BE AWAKE THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE AWAKE WITH YOUR FEET ELEVATED ABOVE YOUR HEAD NOW THAT MIGHT NOT BE PRACTICAL FOR THE WORK PLACE A BUT IT MIGHT BE PRACTICAL FOR A SHORT NAP DURING THE DAY OR OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM IS NOT JS T ACTIVE DURING SLEEP IT'S ALSO ACTIVE DURING CERTAIN PHASES OF WAKING IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE ARE IN A DEEP STATE OF RELAXATION SO AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW I MA BIG PROPONENT OF SELF HYPNOSIS BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ON THIS IF YOUR INTEREST IN SELF HYPNOSIS YOU CAN GO TO REVERI R E V ERI DOT CALM REVERI IS A COST FREE A AP FOR APLAN ENTROID THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY MY COLIGUE DAVID SPEEGAL AND OTHERS THAT THE STAMPORD UNIVERSY SCHOOL MEDICIN BASED ON QUALITY STUDIES AND PUREVIEW DATA SHOWING THAT DEEP STATES OF RELAXATION CAN IN BE USED TO IMPROVE PAIN MANAGEMENT IMPROVE TRANSITION TIME DE SLEEP AND A NUMBER OF OTHER OTHER THINGS YOU CAN SELECT THAT THE VERIOUS THING A SOR OUTCOMES THAT THAT YOU'RE SEEKING O USING REVERIE IT SAY IT'S A GREAT THING THAT ESPECIALY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE CHALLENGE WITH A MEDITATION COULD USE BECAUSE YOU JUST LISTEN TO THE SCRIPT INVOLVES DEEP RELAXATION I WOULD SUGGEST USING THAT SCRIPT BUT WITH OR THE SCRIPT FOR SLEEP BUT WITH FE ELEVATED TO INCREASE ACTIVITY OF THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM NOW IF YOU DO DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO AM TEST OUT THIS A SERATONAN HYPOTHESIS ON YOUR OWN OBVIOUSLY CHECK WITH THE DOCTOR I'M NOT A DOCTOR OM PROFESSOR SON PROFESSING THINGS NOT SUGGESTING THINGS BUT FIVE AH T P IS A SUPPLEMENT THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST THAT I ACTUALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR MOST PEOPLE FOR SAKE OF SLEEP BECAUSE IT CAN DESRUPT THE NORMAL ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP AND CREATE A DEEP SLEEP EARLY IN THE NIGHT AND THEN A SPONTANEOUS WAKING WITH SOME TROUBLE TO GET BACK TO SLEEP AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE SERATONAN SYSTEM AND THE MELETONE AN SYSTEM INTERACT HOWEVER UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE ONE IS FEELING LIKE THEY MIGHT HAVE AN INFECTION OR IN EARLY STAGE OF ILLNESS IN THAT CASE FIVE AH T P MIGHT BE A USEFUL SUPPLEMENT IN ORDER TO ACTS US THE STATES OF SLEEP THAT ARE NOT TYPICAL THEY'RE NOT THE TYPICAL DEEP SLEEP THAT YOU WOULD ACHIEVE ON WHEN YOUR FEELING HEALTHY THESE ARE STATES OF SLEEP THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY THERE IN ORDER TO TRY IND REPAIR SOME OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IRELATED INFLAMMATION THAT'S OCCURRING IF YOUD LIKE TO EXPLORE THE FIVE AH T P APPROACH AND YOU FEEL IT'S RIGHT AND SAFE FOR YOU AND YOU'VE TALKET YOUR DOCTOR IT'S THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS TAKEN ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP FOR THE NIGHT THAT'S THE TYPICAL PROTOCAL NOT INCIDENTALLY INCREASING SERATONAN IS ALSO ONE TYPICAL APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSION THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THINGS LIKE ESSESSARISE SELECTIVE CERETONE AND REUPTAKEN HIBITERS LIKE PROLAC A EXCUSE ME PROSAC AND AM ZOL OFTAND SO FORTH THE FIVE AH HEP APPROACH IS A A MUCH MILDER APPROACH THAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG OF COURSE AM BUT WILL ALLOW MORE CERETONAN TO BE SYNTHESIZE AND OR RELEASED NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM IT'S A FASCINATING SYSTEM AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO A DEEP DIVE THERE IN TERMS OF THE BEHAVIOUR OL PROTOCOLS AND WHAT'S KNOWN ABOUT IT THRE'S A WONDERFUL A ARTICLE CALLED THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM A BEGINNER'S GUIDE AS IS A SIGN TIFIC ARTICLE A THE FIRST AUTHOR IS JESSEN IS THE LAST NAMED G G E S S E N IF YOU PUT IN JESSEN THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM OF BEGINNERS GOD YOU CAN ACCESS THE FULL LENGTH MANUSCRIPT EASILY ON LINE IT ILL SHOW UP ON IMMEDIATELY IN YOUR SEARCH END IN A REALLY INTERESTING WAY THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM HAS NOW ALSO BEEN TIDED TO THE IRON DEPOSITION SYSTEM EARLYOR O TALKING ABOUT IRON AND HOW OF COURSE GETTING ENOUGH DIETARY IRON IS IMPORTANT BUT IF LEVELS OF IRON ARE TOO HIGH IT ISN'T GOOD FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS THERE IS A VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE THAT JUST CAME OUT LAST YEAR CALLED DISFUNCTION OF THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM MIGHT BE RELATED TO IRON DEPOSITION IN THE NORMAL AGING BRAIN SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THESE LINKS BETWEEN IRON LEVELS BEING TOO HIGH THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM NOT BEING ACTIVE ENOUGH AND SO FORTH LEADING TO SICKNESS BEHAVIOR INFLAMMATION AND MAY BE EVEN DAMAGE TO NURON'S ASSOCIATE WITH AGING WE CAN FLIP THAT ON ITS HEAD AND SAY THAT INCREASING THE ACTIVITY OF THE GLEMPHATI SYSTEM FEET ELEVATED DURING DEEP SLEEP MAY BE INTHE ELEVATED A ABOVE THAT THE HEAD ON WHILE AWAKE DURING A NAP OR DOING A REVERE SCRIPT O ONCE A DAY OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT COULD INCREASE THE ACTIVITY THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM LOWERING IRON PINTO A POINT THAT PROBABLY BELOW A THE TYPICAL IN TAKE DURING PERIODS OF OF INFECTION PERHAPS PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY CAN ENHANCE THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM AND VICE VERSA AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS SPECIALIZE SLEEP THAT'S RELATED TO SICKNESS BEHAVIOR THAT SEEMS TO HAVE HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF SERATONAN THAT MIGHT BE AUGMENTED BY INCREASING A IT EXCUSE ME THAT MIGHT BE AUGMENTED BY INGESTING FIVE H T P AGAIN NOT ON A REGULAR BASIS I DON'T SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE TAKE A COMPOUNDS AT INCREASE CERATONE AND UNLESS IT'S PRESCRIBE YOU FOR DEPRESSION OR SOMETHING A BUT NOT DOING IT ON A BY SUPPLEMENT WITH TRIPP TOPHAN OR FHIVE H T P ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT ONLY UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE AS I MENTION YOU MIGHT BE STARTING TO FEEL SICK OR YOUR COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING YOUR COMBATING SOME SORT OF INFECTION SO IF WE CONSIDER THE ADVICE THAT WE TYPICALLY GET WHEN WE'RE NOT FEELING WELL OF TAKE A HOT SHOWER GET GETTINTO BED AND GO TO SLEEP AND WE'VE NOW TOUCHED ON WAYS TO POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF THE SLEEP PART THROUGH THE GLEMPHATIC AND THE SERATONAN SYSTEM WHAT ABOUT TO TAKE A HOT SHOWER PART IS THAT GOOD ADVICE WHELL TURNS OUT IT IS AND THERE'S ACTULY A WAY TO DO EVEN BETTER THERE IS A STUDY VERY INTERESTING STUDY THE TITLE REVEALS WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS ITS EFFECT OF A SINGLE FINISH SANA SESSION ON WHITE BLOODSELL PROFHILE AND CARTISAL LEVELS THIS CASE IT WAS DONE IN ATHLETES AND NON ATHLETES WHICH IS CUN IN ICE THIS INVOLVES TAKING A ATHLETES AN NON ATHLETES AND EXPOSING THEM TO SANA IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY HOT IT WAS NINETY SIX DEGREES WHICH ISN'T COOL BUT IT'S NOT REALLY HOT NOWDAYS YOU HERE ABOUT PEOPLE DOING VERY VERY HOTSANA THE HUMIDITY THE SANA IF YOU WANT TO KNOW AS FIFTEEN PLUSERMISE THREE PER CENT BUT BASICALLY WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT JUST ONE FIFTEEN MINUTE SONA SESSION COULD REALLY INCREASE WHITE BLOODSELL PROFILES AND COULD A JUST COURT IS ALL LEVELS IN WAYS THAT WERE BENEFICIAL FOR COMBATING INFECTION AND NOW THERE ARE MANY OTHER STUDIES LIKE THIS NOW THIS SIOULD IMMEDIATELY MAKE SENSE BASED ON WHAT WE SAID BEFORE ABOUT FEVER HEATING UP CAN ACTUALLY HELP COMBAT INFECTION BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE LISTEN TO THE EPISODES ON TEMPERATURE WHEN YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GET INTO A SANA OR ANY KIND OF HT ENVIRONMENT YOUR BODY IS ALSO GOING TO BE ACTIVELY PUSHING TO COOL ITSELF OFF SO THERE'S PROBABLY AN INCREASE IN HEAT THERE IS AN INCREASE IN HEATING THAT THEN AFTERWARDS YOUR BODY WILL COOL OFF MAYBEVEN WITH A DIP BELOW BASLINE I DO WANT TO PROVIDE A CAUTIONARY NOTE THAT IF YOU ARE ALREADY RUNNING A FEVER GETTING INTO A SANA COULD TAKE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE INTO DANGEROUSLY HIGH LEVELS DANGEROUSLY MEANING YOU CAN KILL NURONS AND ONCE YOU KILL NRONS THEY DO NOT COME BACK SO PLEASE DON'T KILL YOUR NURONS A I DON'T RECOMMEND GETTING INTO A SANA IF YOU ALREADY RUNNING A FEVER SO THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING TO DO AT THE INITIAL STAGE OF AN INFECTION OR IF YOUR FEELING A LITTLE BIT OFF SO THIS IS KIND OF A A RAMPING UP OR A SUPERPROTOCOL OF THE TYPICAL ADVICE OF TAKE A HOT SHOWER AND GET INTO BED THAT IS GOOD ADVISE NOW WERE TALKING ABOUT A HOT SANA PROUABLY SHOWERING OFF AND THEN GETTING INTO BED MAY BE AUGMENTING SARATONA I KNOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SANA SO IN THAT CASE A VERY HOT BATH OR SHOWER DON'T SCALD YOURSELF OF COURSE BUT AS HOT AS YOU CAN COMFORTABLY TOLERATE OR YOU DON'T WRITE AT THAT EDGE OF WHAT YOU CAN TOLERATE WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA SOME PEOPLE I'AVE HEARD ARE CREATING SANAS IN THEIR BATHROOMS BY RUNNING HOT WATER AN CREATING A TON OF STEEM ANYTHING THAT REALLY UM A HEATS YOU UP BUT NOT TO DANGEROUSLY HIGH LEVELS IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL AM IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ASSONA TERRIFIC THIS AGAIN WAS ONLY FIFTEEN MINUTES UM THEY'D HAD A COOL OFF SESSION WOULD YOU GET MORE OF AN INCREASE PEOPLE ALWAYS WENL KNOW IF YOU DID IT TWICE AS MUCH WOULD OU GET TWICE INCREASE THAT THOSE DATA DON'T REALLY EXIST YET HOWEVER IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MAXIMISING THE EFFECTS OF SANA IT IS CLEAR THAT A COOL OFF PERIOD IS INPORTANT SO IT'S NOT THAT AT FIFTEEN MINUTE SANA AS GOOD AN A THIRTY MINUTE SANA IS BETTER IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT ROUTE OF OF EXPLORING MORE IT DOES SEEM THAT DOING A FIFTEEN MINUTE HEATING PERIOD FOLLOWED BY A FIVE TO TEN MINUTE COOLING PERIOD AND THEN GETTING BACK INTO THE HEAT CAN BE A BENEFICIAL AND THIS IS INTERESTING IT GETS TO THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE HYP OF FALMUS THAT A AREAS THE AIRS OF THE HYPOTHALMIS THAT IS THAT GENERATE INCREASES IN BODY HEAT IF THE ACTIVATION OF THOSE NURONS OCCURS AS YOU HEAT UP AND THEN WERE YOU TO JUST STAY IN THAT HEATED ENVIRONMEN THEY WOULD ACTUALLY SHUT OFF AND SOME OTHER NURONS WOULD BE HANDLING THE JOB SO TO SPEAK BUT BY GETTING IN AND OUT OF THE HEATED ENVIRONMENT YOU ACTUALLY FORCE THAT SYSTEM TO SEND REPEATED PULSES OF THESE A COURT IS ALL LOWERING AND WHITE SELL STIMULATING A SIGNALS TO THE BODY SOME OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THE PHRASE FEA D A FEVER STARVOF A COLD I DON'T KNOW WHO FIRST SAID THAT I COULDN'T FIND THE CITATION BUT WE HEAR THIS AND WE CAN SPECULATE THAT THE REASON THAT PHRASE FEED A FEVER STARVE A COLD CAME TO BE IS BECAUSE OF THE ADAPTIVE FUNCTION OF FEVER THAT INCREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR INTRUDING VIRISISM BACTERIA TO SURVIVE EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE HIGHLY ELEVATED BODY TEMPERTURES POSE A DANGER TO THE HOST ORGANISM TO YOU FEADING EATING DOES CAUSE AN INCREASE IN BODY TEMPERATURE THROUGH THE SO CALLED THERMOGENIC EFFECT OF FOOD SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC OF FEED A FEVER IT WOULD MEAN THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A FEVER IT'S YOUR BODI'S NATURAL ATTEMPT TO HEAT UP AND KILL SOME INVADING A THING AND BY EATING YOU WOULD FURTHER INCREASE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO STARVE A COLD I DON'T KNOW HOWEVER A MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOUR NASAL PASSAGES ARE CONGESTED ITS UNCOMFORTABLE TO TO EAT OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT SO THE FEED A FEVER PART MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT THE STARVE A COLD PART IS STILL MYSTERIOUS TO ME I COULDN'T FIND ANY LOGICAL REASON WHY THAT WOULD BE GOOD THERE ARE COMMUNITIES OUT THERE THAT BELIEVE THAT FASTING IS A A VIABLE WAY TO COMBAT A CERTAIN TYPES OF INFECTION FASTING IN PARTICULAR PROLONG FAST DO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF A DRENALIN ALSO CALLED EPINEPFERAN IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND AS WE'LL NEXT EXPLAIN EPINEPRAN A DRENALIN DOES HAVE A POWERFUL EFFECT ON THE VARIOUS INFLAMMATORY SIDA KINDS AND ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IN GENERAL SO LET'S TALK ABOUT A BEHAVIORAL PROTOCAL THAT ANY ONE CAN USE IT DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY EQUIPMENT YOU DON'T NED A SANA I YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING AT ALL THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EXCELLENT PURE REVIEWED RESEARCH TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF THE IMMINE SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO COMBAT INFECTION IN VERY DRAMATIC WAYS NEXT I LIKE TO DO AN INDEPT ANALYSIS OF A STUDY THAT HAS ACHIEVE SOME PROMINENCE OUT THERE NOT JUST IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE BUT ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE IT RELATES TO HOW PARTICULAR TYPES OF BREATHING CAN IMPACT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE ABILITY TO COMBAT INFECTION THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS VOLUNTARY ACTIVATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ATTENUATION OF THE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN HUMANS THIS IS HE PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN P N A S WHICH IS THE PROCEEINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES YOU ESSAY IT'S A VERY PRESTIGIOUS JOURNAL FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT NO PIANAS YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PAPERS PUBLISH IN PIANAS ERE THERE USED TO BE THAT WERE NOT PURE REVIEWED IN RECENT YEARS I THINK ALL OF THEM HAVE MOVED TO PURE REVEWED PAPERS O THIS IS A PURE REVIEWED VERY HIGH QUALITY STUDY AND I JUST WANTED TO SCRIBE THE BASIC CONTEUR OF THE STUDY I'LL EXPLAIN THE FINDINGS AND THEN I WANT TO GO INDEPTH AND EXPLAIN THE MECHANISTIC BASIS FOR THESE FINDINGS AND THE PROTOCOL THAT WE CAN ALL EXPORT FROM THESE FINDINGS SO HERE WE GO FIRST OF ALL A COUPLE OF TERMS SO THAT EVERYBODY IS ON THE SAME PAGE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ONE DIVISION OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM ITS A SET OF NURONS ADOWN THE MIDDLE OF OUR SPINAL CORD AND IN OUR BRAIN THAT GENERALLY LEAD TO A HEIGHTENED STATE OF AROUSAL AND ALERTNESS IS ASSOCIATE WITH EPINEPHRON RELEASE IN THE BRAIN AND A DRENALINE RELEASE IN THE BODY IT'S THE SO CALLED FIGHTER FLIGHT SYSTEM WHEN IT'S REALLY ACTIVE BUT IT'S THE SYSTEM THAT'S ACTIVE WHEN WE ARE WIDE AWAKE AND WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT'S THAT FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AFTER THE SKIN BARRIER OF COURSE WHEREBY SOME INFECTION COMES INTO THE BODY AND THERE'S THIS RAPID RESPONSE OF INCREASING IN FLAMMATION AND THAT'S ALSO ABOUT THE TIME THAT YOU FIRST FEEL LOUSY WHENYOU IC FEEL LIKE I THINK I'VE GOT SOMETHING I DON'T FEEL RIGHT A HEAD ACHE I FEEL NAUCHOS I HEETING OP I I DON'T FEEL GOOD THAT'S THAT'S THE THE INNATE MUNE SYSTEM KICKING IN S WHAT THEY DID IN THE STUDY AND BY THE WAY I SHOULD SAY THEY A THIS IS  FIRST AUTHOR IS COX CAO ACTS LAST AUTHOR LAST NAME PICKERS P I S KK E AR S WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY EXPOSED HUMAN SUBJECTS TO AN ENDOTOXEN BY INGI IN ANOTHER WORDS THEY INJECTED PEOPLE WITH ECOLI IS A BACTERIA WHICH MAKES PEOPLE ALL PEOPLE FEEL TERRIBLE SENAUTIOUS FEVER VOMITING DIARRHEA IS VERY UNPLEASANT OKI THESE PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY SIGNED UP FOR THE STUDY HOWEVER SOME OF THE SUBJECTS IN THIS STUDY PERFORMED A BEHAVIORAL PROTOCOL THAT CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS SICLIC HYPER VENTILATION MY LAB WORKS ON THESE TYPES OF BREATHING PROTOCOLS THIS IS NOT WORK THAT MY LAP DED BUT BASELY SUBJECTS I PEREVENTILATE FOLLOWED BY BREATH FRETENSION BY BREATH HOLDS AND I'LL EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID THEY ALSO LOOKED AT OTHER FORMS OF BEHAVIORAL PROTOCOLS BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THAT ONE SO THEYRE COMPARING CONTROLS THAT DO JUST SORT OF A BASIC MEDITATION VERSIS PEOPLE THAT DO THES INTENSE BREATHING FOLLOWED BY SOME BREATH HOLDS I'M JUST PERAPHRASING HERE IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP THE BREATHING GROUP PLASMA LEVELS OF ANTI IN FLAMMATORY SIDE OF KIND IAL TEN SO THIS IS A SIDE O KIND THAT IS LOWERS INFLAMMATION INCREASED AFTER ENDOTOXIN ADMINISTRATION AND THAT WAS TRIGGERED BY AN INCREASE IN EPINEPRN IND A DRENALIN SO IN OTHER WORDS DOING A PARTICULAR PATTERN OR BREATHING ALLOWED AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY SIDE OF KIND TO BE TURNED ON WHEREAS THAT WAS NOT THE CASE IN THE SUBJECTS THAT DID NOT DO THIS PARTICULAR BREATHING CAL PROTOCOL AND THEY DISCOVERED THAT LEVELS OF PROIN FLAMMATORY T ANOUGH ALFA TUMERNECROSUS FACTOR ALPA ILESEX INTERLUCANSICS AN INTERLUCANATE WHICH YOU SHOULD ALL BE FAMILIAR WITH NOW AS PROIN FLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS WERE LOWER IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP WHEREAS THESE ISLE TEN LEVELS THAT ARE ANTINFLAMMATORY WENT UP FINALLY FLULIKE SYMPTEMS WERE LOWER IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP SO THIS IS AN AMAZING FINDING IS ARE HUMAN SUBJECTS ONE IS ONE GROUP OF SUBJECTS IS DOING THIS BREATHING PROTOCALL THE OTHER GROUP OF SUBJECTS IS JUST MEDITATING THEY BOTH BOTH SETS OF SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN IN INJECTED WITH E COLI SO YOU KNOW EVERY ONE'S GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT PLACED INTO THEIR SYSTEM THIS IS VERY VERY INTERESTING AND IT LEADS TO THE QUESTION THAT EVERY GOOD SCIENTIST TO YEAR OLD OR HEALTH INFORMATION SEEKER ASKS WHICH IS WHY HOW HOW IN THE WORLD DOES THIS WORK WHY DOES THIS WORK WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT ISH BECAUSE I AM GOING TO GOINTO DEPTH HERE THE REASON IT WORKS IS BECAUSE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE SO CALLED STRESS PART OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IT'S NOT REALLY CALLED THAT BUT THE PART OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT TRIGGER STRESS FROM MILD STRESS TO SEVERE STRASS EVENTO PANIC CAUSES THE RELEASE OF A DRANALIN AN EPINEPERON IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN WE HAVE SOME SORT OF INVADING INFECTION OUR BODY IS ABLE TO PUSH BACK ON THAT TO RESIST IT BY ENGAGING THE STRESS RESPONSE SO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THERE'S A THERE'S A BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALL INVOLVING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAS ALL BEHAVIORS ARE GENERATED FROM THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF COURSE A BEHAVIORAL PROTOCAL THAT PEOPLE ARE DELIBERATELY EMPLOYING THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ACTIVATE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH INTERN ALLOWS THEM TO ACTIVATE THE NORMAL PATHWAYS BY WHICH IMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IS ENHANCED OKE NOW THE REASON I'M UNDER SCORING THIS IS THAT THE COMMON INTERPRETATION OF THIS STUDY IS THAT SOMEHOW IT BLOCKS THE NORMAL IMUNE RESPONSE BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE YES THERE'S A REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS AND THERE 'S AN INCREASE IN ANTIINFLAMMATORY SIDE A KINDS BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE SAME THING AS BLOCKING THE IMMUNE RESPONSE THIS COULD JUST AS EASILY BE VIEWED AS ENHANCING THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND COMBATING THE INTRUDER IN THIS CASE ECOLI SO LET'S PARSH THIS STUDY A LOWBIT MORE CLOSELY FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS THIS MAGICAL PATTERN OF BREATHING SOME OF YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THIS AS SO CALLED WHIMHOFF BREATHING WHIM OF COURSE THE DUCHMEN I THINK HIS OCCUPATION ON LINE USED TO BE LISTED AS DARE DEVIL BELIEVEIT ARE NOT UN WICUPETA THAT'S A PRETTY COOL A OCCUPATION A VIM IS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS ACTIVITIES WITH COLD EXPOSURE EHOLDS MULTIBLE WORLD RECORDS FOR THAT AM SWIMMING UNDER ICEBERGS ANOTHER AN INCREDIBLE FEATS A THAT YOU DEFFLING DON'T WANT TO TRY A UNLESS YOUARE EXEXTREMELY SKILLED AND REALLY KNOWHAT YOURE DOING AS AS HE DOES BUT ALSO FOR THE USE OF BREATHWORK THE BREATHING THAT IS SO CALLED WHIM HOFF BREATHING IS VERY SIMILAR NOT EXACTLY THE SAME BUT VERY SIMILAR TO TUMO BREATHING AS IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED HISTORICALLY IN THE SCIENCE AND PHYSIOLOGY COMMUNITY AND IN MY LABORATORY COS I RUNN UNIVERSY LABORATORY REFER TO IT A SYCLIC HYPE R VENTILATION WHICH JUST MEANS REPEATED DEEP BREATHS IN AND OUT AND THEN THERE THESE RETENSION SO I'M A BECAUSE I'M HERE A IN THE HOT SEA ANYWAY I MIGHT AS WELL A DEMONSTRATE IT FOR YOUSE TO YOU KNO AT THIS LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE VARIATIONS ON THIS SO WITH RESPECT TO WHIM WITH RESPECT TO TUMO PRACTITIONERS WITH RESPECT TO THE SYCLHYPE REVENTILATORS EVERYWHERE THIS IS ONE GENERAL THEME OF IT IT INVOLVES TWENTY TO THIRTY DEEP INHALS AND AND THEN EXALES THROUGH THE MOUTH FOLLOWED BY A EXHALE OF ALL ONE'S AIR AND A BREATH HOLD THAT'S THE RETENSION AND THEN AT SOME POINT FIFTEEN TO SIXTY SECONDS LATER REPEATING THE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREATHS AND THEN AGAIN A A BREATH HOLD WITH LUNGS EMPTY THERE ARE VARIATIONS ON THIS BUT IN OUR LABORATORY AND O IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY IF IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS K I AM NOT GOING TO DO THE WHOLE THING RIGHT NOW BUT IT IT GO SOMETHING LIKE THIS CASO LET'S US SUME I DO THAT FOR THIRTY THIRTY BREATH I CAN ALREAY FEEL MYSELF A PERSPIRING A LITTLE BIT YOUR HEATING UP THAT'S THE RELEASE OF A DRENOLIN CAUSED BY THAT BREATHING PATTER ND THEN EXHALING ALL OF ONCE THERE NO SPEAKING BETWEEN LIKE I'M DOING AND THEN SITTING LUNGS EMPTY UNTIL ONE FEELS THE IMPULSE TO BREATHE AND THEN REPEATING FOR SEVERAL ROUNDS TWO OR THREE OR EVEN FOUR ROUNDS NOW SOME PEOPLE WILL ALSO INTRODUCE A BIG INHALE IN BREATH HOLD AT THE END AND FIND THAT INDEED THEY CAN HOLD THEIR BREATH MUCH LONGER THAN THEY NORMALLY WOULD BE ABLE TO BECAUSE THE TRIGGER TO BREATHE IS NORMALLY ACTIVATED BY INCREASES IN CARBONDOXIDE IN OUR BLOOD WE HAVE NURONS IN OUR BRAIN STEM AND IN OUR VARIOUS REGIONS OF OUR BRAIN ACTUALLY THAT RESPOND TO WHEN CARBONDAOXIDE IS TO HIGH AND TRIGGER THE REFLECTS TO BREATHE BUT WHEN WE EXHALE  DEEPLY WE BLOW OFF A LOT OF CARBONOXIDE SO WE DON'T FEEL THAT IMPULSE TO BREATHE COME QUITE AS SOON BASICALLY THIS STUDY LOOKED AT PEOPLE DOING THESE HI PREVENT SYCLIHYPERVENTILATION WITH RETENSION TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREATHS THAN THE RETENSION TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREAT THEN RETENSION TWENTY FIVE THIRTY BREATH THEN THE RETENSIONS OF THREE ROUNDS OF TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY BREATH FOLLOWED BY EXHALE HOLD IN BETWEEN OF VARIOUS DURATION BUT IN GENERAL FIFTEEN TO SIXTY SECONDS IS TYPICAL WHAT HAPPENED PHYSIOLOGICALLY THIS WHAT ONE OF THEREASONS I LIKE THIS STUDY WHAT HAPPENED PHYSIOLOGICALLY WELL COUPL OF THINGS COURSE BLOOD OXIGUNATION DROPS YOU WOULD EX BECT THAT BASED ON HIPERVENTILATION AND ESPECIALLY BASED ON THE EXTELL OF SO MUCH CARBONALXIDE WE COULD EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS BUT BLOOD BLOOD LE BLOOD LEVELS OF OXAGEN DROP THE P H THE ALKALINITY OF THE BODY GOES WAY UP THIS IS VERY INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK UP THIS PAPER YOUCAN LOK A FIGURE ONE PANEL SEA THE P H GOES WAY UP PEOPLE BECOME ALKALINE YOU'VE EARD FOR OF ALKALINE WATER AN I HAINT TO SAY THIS I PRILOSE SOME FRIENDS FOR THIS BUT YET DON'T DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON DRINKING ALKAL ALKALINE WATER YOU CAN'T RELY SHIFT THE ALKALINITY OF YOUR BODY OM THERE ARE CASES WHERE SOME COMPARTMENT IN YOUR BODY NEEDS TO BE MORE ALKALINE THAN THE REST YOU'R GOT IS THE DIFFERENT ALKALINITY THAN OTHER AIRAS OF YOUR BODY ET CETERA BUT IN JESTING HIGH ALKALINE WATER ISN'T GAEN A SHIFT YOUR OVER ALL ALKALINITY IF YOU SOME ONE CAN SEND ME A QUALITY REFERENCE THAT SHOWS DIFFERENT THAT I'M HAPPY TO REVISE THAT STATEMENT BUT IN ANY CASE DOING THAT PATTERN OF BREATHING THAT JUST DESCRIBED GREATLY INCREASES A P H  GREATLY I I SHOULD SAY DOESN'T SEND IT OFF IN TO DANGEROUS LEVELS HIT TAKES IT FROM SEVEN POINT FOUR TO SEVEN POINT SIX WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE A IN ALKALINITY SO AS P H LEVELS FOR THOSE YOU REMEMBER HIGHSCHOOL OR A COLLEGE CHEMISTRY AS AS THE NUMBERS ON THE P H GO DOWN YOU'RE BECOMING MORE ACITIC AS THEY GO UP YOUR BECOMING MORE ALKALNE OCA OR MORE BASIC SO YOU FROM SEVEN THESE SUBJECTS WHEN FROM SEVEN POINT FOUR TO SEVEN POINT SIX DURING THE BREATHING AND THEN AFTERWARDS IT RETURN TO NORMAL BUT THAT SHIFT IN ALKALINITY IS THOUGHT TO BE IMPORTANT HERE SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE HOW IS THE BREATHING LEADING TO THE SHIFTS IN WHERE I SHOULD SAY REDUCTION IN INFLANMATORY SIDEOKINES AND AN INCREASE IN THE LIBERATION OF THESE ANTINEFLANMATORY SIDE OF KINDS WELL THE AUTHORS MAKE SOME GOOD ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY IT'S NOT THE SHIFT IN P H PER SAY OR THE SHIFT IN CARBON ALXIDE LEVELS IN THE BLOOD BUT RATHER IT'S THE RELEASE OF EPINEFERON THERE'S SOME GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE WHY THAT'S THE CASE IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS DISCUSSION BUT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THE RELEASE OF EPINEFRON A K DRENALINE THAT'S CAUSING THIS REDUCTION AND INFLAMMATION AND THAT'S ACTUALLY SUPPORTED BY SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY EXPERIENCED BEFORE WHICH IS IF YOU'VE EVER WORKED WORKD WORKED ORK WORKED REALLY HARD OR YOU'VE BEEN CA A CARETAKER FOR SOMEBODY ELSE OR STUDYING FOR EXAMS AND PEOPLE AROUND YOU ARE GETTING SICK AND YOU'RE JUST POWERING THROUGH IT AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING SICK BUT THEN YOU STOP YOU TURN IN YOUR FINAL EXAMOU YOU STOP TAKING CARE OF SOMEBODY ELSE OR YOU FINALLY STOP AND REST OR YOU GO ON VACATION AND THEN YOU GET SIC WELL YOU'VE JUST EXPERIENCED THE EFFECT THAT ADRENNALINE EPINEFERON CAN HAVE IN ACTIVATING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BY WAY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ORDER TO KEEP FIGHTING AND COMBATING INFECTION AND THAT BRINGS US TO A LARGER THEME WHICH IS THAT STRESS AND COMBATING INFECTION OR A WOUND IS NOT ONE UNIQUE SYSTEM IT'S THE SAME STRESS SYSTEM THAT YOUUSED TO COMBAT PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS SO WHEN YOUR VERY VERY STRESSED AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE YOU RELEASE SO MUCH A DRENDLINE IN EPINEPERAN YOUAR ACTUALLY BETTER ABLE TO COMBAT INFECTIONS AND YOU REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND THE WHOLE FEELING LOSY RESPONSE OR IGHT REMEMBER REDUCED FLUE LIKE SYMPTOMS HERE SO THIS PATTERN OF BREATHING IS ACTUALLY A VERY USEFUL TOO AND I CONFESS I USE THIS PATTERN OF BREATHING ANY TIME I AM AT THE INITIAL STAGES OF OF GETTING SOME SORT OF BUG IF I FEEL LIKE HAVE BEEN RUNNING MYSELF RAGGED OR IF I SOMEHOW FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE A TICKLE MY THROAT OR IE HAVE THAT CONA SENSATION O MY NOSE I I MIGHT HAVE A IT MAY MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT A BUG OF SOME SORT I WILL DO THIS PATTERN OF BREATHING I BEEN DOING IT CONSISTENTLY I SHOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS OR OR MORE A YANA THIS IS JUST ANECDOTAL A REPORTS BUT I FIND THAT IT ALLOWS ME INDEED TO EITHER HAVE THOSE EARLY SYMPTEMS DISAPPEAR OR IT ALLOWS ME TO JUST CONT OF PUSH THROUGH AND AND HARDER LONGER I DON'T SUGGEST PEOPLE CONTINUE TO PUSH THROUGH EXPOSURE TO INFECTIONS OBVIOUSYDO ON A INFACT OTHER PEOPLE A NOR DO YOU WANT TO CRASH AND SUDDENLY GET GET A MASSIVE ON ILLNESS OF SOME SORT BECAUSE YOU STOP DOING THIS BREATHING BUT I DO THINK IT'S A USEFUL TOOL TO PURELY BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTION THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN HERE AND NOW THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STUDIES ON THE WAY TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF YOUR MUNE SYSTEM AND TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND THIS IS TO ME ONE OF THE MOST CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF A ZERO COST TO THAT BRIDGE IS THE ACTIVATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH BREATHING WITH THE IMUNE SYSTEM BY WAY OF RELEASING A DRENALINE AND THEREBY REDUCING THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS OR FEELINGS OF LOUSINESS FROM A IN THIS CASE ANY COLI INFECTION NOW I LIKE TO FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT POINTS THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD DISGUSTD BROADLY ELSEWHERE WHICH IS THAT THE HYPER VENTILATION AND THE BREATH RETENTION ARE BOTH IMPORTANT SO YOU CAN'T SIMPLY HYPER VENTILATE TO GET THIS THIS EFFECT AT THE LEVEL OF EPINEPERAN RELEASE AND REDUCTION AN INFLAMMATORY PCYTAHINES IT'S BEEN SHOWN BEFORE THAT THE HYPERVENTILATION FASE AND THE HY POXIA WHICH IS A CAN LOW LOW OXYGEN SATURATION DUE TO THE BREATH RETENTION THEY BOTH COMBINE TO INCREASE EPINEFERN A DRENALIN LEVELS SO YOU HAVE TO DO THE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREASTS AND THEN THE RETENTION TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREASTS THAN THE RETENTION MEANING THAT THE EXTAILE WITH THE BREATHHOLD IN ORDER TO GET THE FULL EFFECT I ALSO WAN TO PROVIDE CRITICAL CAUTIONARY NOTE DON'T DO THIS ANYWHERE NEAR WATER OR WHILE DRIVING A CAR THESE SINGS AR MIGHT SEEM KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT A OBVIOUSLY IN THE OFF CHANCE THAT YOU BLACK OUT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT COULD BE DISASTROU SO SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL A AND AGAIN DON'T TRY PUSH THE BREATH HOLD ATHE MOMENT YOU FEEL THE IMPULSE TOBRYH JUST BREATHE AAND IT DID SEEM THAT THE THREE ROUNDS OF TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY BREAT WITH INTERVENTIONS AEXCUSE ME WITH A BREATHOLD RETENSIONS IN BETWEEN WAS THE IDEAL PROTOCOL THERE'S ONE LAST VERY INTERESTING FEATURE OF THIS STUDY THAT I WANT A EMPHASIZE AND THAT WAS THAT THEY ACTUALLY MEASURED THE SO CALLED CATACOLAMINE CONCENTRATIONS CATACOLAMINES ARE THINGS LIKE DOPAMINE EPINEFRAN NORIPINEFRAN THESE ARE CHEMICALS IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BODY THAT PROMOTE STATES OF ALERTNESS A DOPAMIN OF COURSE PART OF THE REWARD AND MOTIVATION PATHWAYS THEY EXPLORED THE LEVELS OF THESE MOLECULES IN BLOOD IN PLASMA DURING AND AFTER THIS BREATHING PROTOCOL AND AS INTERESTING AS I MENTION BEFORE EP ANEFRAN SHOWED ROBUST INCREASEIS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP NOREPANEFRAN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES OCCURRED IN THE IN THE BREATHING GROUP BUT A IN THE SYCLICAPROVENILATION RETENSION A BREATHING GROUP OF COURSE A BUT LESS SO A AND DOPOMINE LEVELS ACTUALLY A DROP SOMEWHAT BUT THIS IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE IS A NEW AND EMERGING LITERATURE LARGELY FROM ISA A WI ESSA ROLLS LAB A IN ISRAEL WHAT HER LABORATORY HAS SHOWN IS THAT MOTIVATIONAL STATE AND MIND SET HAS A POWERFUL IMPACT ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE UMION SYSTEM THAT WERE THOUGHT TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE BRAIN AND MIND AND THINKING SO THIS BRINGS US BACK TO SOMETHING THAT WE DISCUSED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS EPISODE WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD HEAL THE BODY WITH THE MIND WITH CONSIDERED ON OF QUACKERY A I THINK THAT THERE WIS AN INTERVENING PERIOD UP UNTIL NOW WHERE PEOPLE AT MIGHT HAVE SAID SURE IF YOUR STRESSED OUT ITS CAN TO MAKE THINGS WORSE IN MAY I THINK EVERYONE AGREES THAT STRESS MAKES EVERY THING WORSE AT SOME LEVEL A OUTCOMES TO NER DEGENERATION PERFORMANCE IN A PHYSICAL ENDEAVORS IN MENTAL ENDEAVORS IF STRESSES TOO HIGH FOR TOO LONG PEOPLE EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND ESSENTIALLY EVERY MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER EVERYTHING SUFFERS BUT IN THE SHORT TERM STRESS CAN ACTUALLY BE BENEFICIAL IN THE WAYS THAT WE JUST DESCRIBED AND STRESS IF YOU WE BREAK IT DOWN IS REALLY A NEROCHEMICAL STATE RYD ITS THE RELEASE OF THESE CATACOLAMINES AND WHAT ISA ROLLSES LABORATORY HAS SHOWN IS THAT WHEN THE SO CALLED DOPAMINE SYSTEM AND THAT SEVERAL EPISODES I DESCRIBE THEIR MULTIPLE DOPOMINE SYSTEMS BUT THE O CALLED MESA LIMBIC REWARD PATHWAY INVOLVING ERIOS LIKE THE NUCLIUS A COMBANS ET CETERA WHEN THE REWARD SYSTEM THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH DOPOMINE AN NORN NORAP INEFRAN IS ACTIVATED YOU SEE INCREDIBL EFFECTS INCLUDING FOR INSTANCE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TUMOR SIZE IN CANCERS NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE WHY HOW IS IT THAT MINE SET DOPOMINE AND TUMORS ARE AND TUMOR GROWTH ARESOMEHOW LINK WE NOW KNOW HOW THIS OCCURS LARGELY THROUGH THE INCREDIBLE WORK OF ICAROLLS AND OTHERS SO NOW I LIKE TO TURN OUR FOCUS TO HOW IT IS SPECIFICALLY THAT CERTAIN MINE SETS IN PACT THE IMIUN SYSTEM IN WAYS THT WE CAN ACTUALLY POINT TO SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS AND ALSO SPECIFIC PROTOCALS RELATED TO MINE SET I GUESS A SIMPLE WAY TO FRAME ALL THIS WOULD BE TO SAY THAT MOST OF US ARE AWARE THAT YES INDEED YOU CAN WORRY YOURSELFS SICK WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT YOU CAN'T WORRY YOURSELF SICK AND ACTUALLY THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED IN SCIENCE AGAIN ONE OF THE TOP THREE JOURNALS OUT THERE THE TOP THREE REALLY BEING NATURE SCIENCE AND SELL AND THEND OTHER OF COURSE EXCELLENT JOURNALS EXISTS BUT THIS WAS A PAPER THAT CAME OUT IN SCIENCE A LAST YEAR FIRST AUTHOR IS CATAOCA K A T A O K A DESCRIBING PSYCHOGENICSTRESS AND FEVER SO THIS WAS LOOKING OR ASKING THE QUESTION ARE THERE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ACTUALLY UNDERLIE THIS NOTION THAT WE CAN WORRY OURSELFS SICK AND THEY DISCOVERED A NEW PATHWAY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO BOTH ACTIVATE THIS PATHWAY INDEPENDENT OF WORRY IN STRESS AND SEE ILLNESS OCCUR AND THEY WERE ABLE TO INHIBIT THIS PATHWAY BLOCK ACTIVITY IN THES NERAL PATHWAY AND PREVENT PSYCHOGENIC FEVER AND THE WORRYING OF ONE SELF SICK SO THEY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THIS OM IN A VERY CONTROLLED WAY I'LL JUST MENTION THE PATHWAY IN CAS A YOU WANT TO LOOK IT UP IN MORE DETAIL THIS IS A CORTICO LIMBIC PATHWAY SO FOR A JUST A ORIENTUS THE CORTEX IS IT MORE LESS THE OUTER SHELL OF OF THE BRAIN ITS INVOLVED IN THINKING AND SENSATION AND PERCEPTIONS AND LEARNING AND MAINT MAINTENANCE OF A LOT OF MEMORIES ARE STORED THERE WE ALL HEAR THAT YOU LEARN I U YOU LEARN AND REMEMBER IN THE HYPPOCAMPUS THAT'S THE INITIAL SIDE OF LEARNING AND AND MEMORY BUT THEN THAT INFORMATION BELIEVE OR NOS PASSED OFF TO THE QUARTECS WERE IT STORED IN KIND OF A LONG LONG TERM HARD DRIVE TYPE STORAGE SO THE CORTICO LIMBIC PATHWAY IS ONE IN WHICH YOUR THOUGHTS YOUR PRIOR EXPERIENCES CAN LITERALLY ENOUGH IN A STRUCTURE WAY FEED DOWN ON TO THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL VERY BAZAL PROCESSIES INCLUDING TEMPERATURE REGULATION SO THIS IS A CORTICO LIMBIC HYPOTHILAMIC PATHWAY WE TALKED EARLY ABOUT THE HYPOTHAMUSIS CONTROLLING TEMPERATURE IN A LOT OF SICKNESS RELATED BEHAVIOR RIGHT REMEMBER VAGUES UP TO THE HYPOTHALMAS AND ALL THE SLEEP MORE OR LESS APPETHITE FEVER OKE THAT'S ALL IN THE HYPOTHALMUS THIS IS A TOP DOWN CORTICO LIMBIC HYPOTHAL THELAMBIC PATHWAY AND IT HAS A FANCY NAME IT'S THE DORSO PEPEDUNCULAR CORTEX DORSAL TENEA TECTA THE SHORT OF THAT IS THE D P D T TS LET JUS CALL THE D P T T T TO THE DORSIMEDIO HYPOTHALMUS  LATA DS HIT SHOULDN'T MEAN ANYTHING DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT WE CALL IT BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS CONCEPTIALLY IT'S A PATHWAY THAT ORIGINATES AND SIGHTES OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH THINKING WITH EMOTION AND WITH PRIOR HISTORY AND FEEDS DIRECTLY INTO AN AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT'S INVOLVED IN BASIC PHYSIOLOGICAL SUBCONSCIOUSLY CONTROLLD PROCESSIES SO THAT'S INCREDIBLE RIGHT AND IT POINTS TO A PHYSICAL PATHWAY BY WHICH THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT SOMETHING CHANGES SOMETHING CORE ABOUT OUR PHYSIOLOGY NOW IN SOME WAYS THAT SHOULD BE SURPRISING RIGHT IF YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT EXCITES YOU YOUR HEARTRATE CAN INCREASE YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT TERRIFIES YOUR HEARTRATE CAN INCREASE SO TAT YEAT THAT THINKING CONTROLS OUR PHYSIOLOGY IS NOT IN WHO CONCEPT AT ALL A BUT SOMEHOW HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE BEEN A CHALLENGE WITH THE IDEA THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY THINK OURSELVES INTO BEING SICK BUT THIS PAPER FROM CATOCA SHOWS THAT IF YOU EXPOSE SOMEBODY TO A PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS YOU CAN ACTUALLY ACTIVATE THIS PATHWAY IN CREATE A FEVER AND HOW DID THEY DO THAT WELL YOU CAN DO THIS BY EXPOSING SUBJECTS TO UM A VERY STRESSFUL REAL EVENT AND YOU CUIT THROUGH ASSOCIATOF LEARNING SO MAY BE IN ALL LIKE MY PILOT V FIVES WHICH I LOVE SO MUCH YOU KNOW WE COULD DROMATIZE ME TO THE PILOT V FIVE IF I HAD SOME HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE HAPPEN ME WHILE I'M LOOKING AT AND CONCENTRATE IN THE PILOT V FVE THEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE YOU GIVE ME THE PILET OF YOU FIVE AND I SARE TO EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TERRIBLE EVENT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THIS USING SICKNESS IN DUCING STIMULE AND SO FORTH THEY DID ALL THE VARIOUS A DERIVATIONS AND IDENTIFY THIS PATHWAY THAT WHEN ACTIVATED EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME HORRIBLE EVENT COULD CREATE FEVER AND ILLNESS LIKE BEHAVIOR AND SO FORTH AND IF THEY BLOCKED CERTAIN STATIONS ALONG THIS NERAL PATHWAY THEY COULD BLOCK THAT EFFECT SO THIS IS REALLY CONCRETE EVIDENCE PROOF IF YOU WILL THAT THERE ARE DEDICATED PATHWAYS IN THE MAMMALIAN BRAIN YOUR BRAIN IN MIND THAT ALLOW US TO TURN THOUGHTS INTO ILLNESS THAT'S KIND OF A DEPRESSING IDEA WHAT ABOUT THE INVERSE WHAT ABOUT TURNING THOUGHTS INTO HEALTH WELL THAT'S THE WORK OF ICEROLLS THEY EXPLORED THE WELL ESTABLISH PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON THAT WHEN CANCERPATIONCE OR VERY ILL PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING FROM VERY DEBILITATING INJURIES WHEN THEY HAD OR REWHEN PEOPLE HAD OR REPORTED A SENSE OF HOPE THEIR RATES OF RECOVERY WERE MUCH HIGHER RIGHT SOUNDS VERY SUBJECTIVE BUT WHAT IS A SENSE OF HOPE A SENSE OF HOPE IS A SENSE OF THE FUTURE A SENSE OF THE FUTURE IS TIGHTLY ASSOCIATE WITH THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM DOPPOMEN AGAIN BEING THIS MOLECUL O REWARD AND MOTIVATION AND MOVEMENT BUT MOVEMENT AND MOTIVATION ARE ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND THE CONFINES OF OUR SKIN AND ARE ABOUT THE FUTURE AND SO WHAT THEY DISCOVERED AND THROUGH OTHER STUDIES FROM OTHER GROUPS HAVE DISCOVERED IS THAT STIMULATION OF THE DOPOMINE PATHWAY EITHER SIMPLY BY THINKING ABOUT APA FUTURE IDEALLY A POSITIVE FUTURE BUT THINKING ABOUT A POSITIVE FUTURE LEADS TO ACTIVATION OF THIS SO CALL MEASOLYMBIC REWARD PATHWAY AND COULD REDUCE THE SIZE OF TUMERS COULD ACCELERATE WOUND HEALING COULD GREATLY ACCELERATE THE PASSAGE FROM A STATE OF ILLNESS TO A STATE OF HEALTH AND WELL BEING SO THERE ARE MANY MANY STUDIES NOW STARTING TO WIK OUT RELATED TO THIS THERE'S ALSO THE IDEA THAT AUGMENTING THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM CAN INCREASE THE RATE OF HEALING AND SO THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE WHO OPT FOR INSTANCE TO TAKE THINGS THAT INCREASE DOPOMINE NOW OBVIOUSLY DRUGS OF ABUSE A WOULD NOT BE A GOOD IDEA IN THIS CONTEXT EVEN THOUGH THY INCREASE DOPOMING THEY LEAD THE BIG CRASHES THEY AVE EDICTIVE PROPERTIES AT ET CETERA I'VE TALKED BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THINGS LIKE ELTYRASINE TAKE IT ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO YO SEVENHUNDRED FIFTY MILEGRAMS CAN INCREASE DOPOMINE BECAUSE TYRICINE AS A DOPOMING PRECURSOR OF COURSE THINGS LIKE MECUNIPURINES WHICH ARE AL DOPA THE IMMEDIATE PRECURSER TO DOPOMINE SOME OF THESE WILL LEADS TO SOMEWHAT OF A CRASH OM IN CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OTHER PEOPLE TOLERATE THEM A LITTLE B BETTER AGAIN YOAVE TO TALK YOUR DOCTRY UVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIHTE FOR YOU IF YOU HAVE BYPOLAR OR MANIOR SCHISIPHRANIA A THESE THINGS ARE I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL I'MNOT RECOMMENDING THEM ALL I'M JUST MENTION THEM FOR POTENTIAL EXPLORATION IF IT SAFE AND RIGHT FOR YOU BUT THE POINT IS THIS THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM WHEN ACTIVATED CAN ACCELERATE HEALING IT CAN ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY FROM INJURY OF ALL KINDS AND THAT SHOULDN'T COME AS A MYSTERY OR SURPRISE RESULT TO US IT'S BECAUSE THIS REWARD PATHWAY AND THE FACT THAT IT'S RELATED TO A SENSE OF THE FUTURE SEEMS TO LIBERATE ENTIRE SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BODY THAT MAKE INFLAMATORY SDE OF KINDS GO DOWN AND ANTIAM FLAMATORY SITAKINDS GO UP EXACTLY AS WAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE BEAUTIFUL PIANA STUDY WHERE BREATHING SICKLIC HYPEROVENTILATION WAS USED TO INCREASE APANEFER AND INCREASE NORUPANEFFERAN AND TO AUGMENT THE CATACATACOLOMINE SYSTEM SO I THINK TOT THAT THE BRIDGES BETWEEN THESE STUDIES ARE REALLY RELEVANT IN ONE CASE I'M TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY TAKING A AND OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUND TO INCREASE DOPOMINE TO ACCELERATE HEALING IN ANOTHER CASE FORE TALKING ABOUT USING BREATHING THEREIS ALSO THE USE OF COLD WATER EXPLOSURE TO INCREASE DOPOMINE I TALKED ABOUT THIS SEVERAL EPISODES AGO BUT IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT COLD WAT IMMERSING ONESELF IN COLD WATER UP TO THE NECK OR SO HOW COLD WILL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU CAN TOLERATE BUT UNCOMFORTABLY COLD BUT NOT SO COLD THAT OU BECOME HYPOTHERMIC BUT WERE YOU IT'S CHALLENGING TO GET IN BUT YOU CAN STAY THERE FOR YOUON THREE TO TEN MINUTES OR SO HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO VERY SIGNIFICANT UP DOUBLING OR MORE OF BASE LINE DOPOMINE LEVELS AN EPINEFRAN LEVELS THAT GO ON FOR SEVERAL HOURS THIS MAY BE THE BASIS FOR WHY PEOPLE WILL DO COL SHOWERS OR ICE BAS AND THEN GET INTO ASSONA SO WHAT'S CALL CONTRAST COLD CON COLD HEAT CONTRAST THERAPY AS HE WAY TO AUGMENT THESE NERV TRANSMITTERS TO DAY WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW THESE NOR TRANSMITTERS CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND SO JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT ANY TIME YOU TALKING ABOUT INCREASING NOR TRANSMITTER LEVELS THAT CAN BE DONE PHARMICOLOGICALLY THROUGH SUPPLEMENTATION OR IT CAN BE DONE BEHAVIORLY THROUGH EXPOSURE TO COLD WATER FOR INSTANCE OR IT CAN BE DONE EVEN JUST SIMPLY BY BREATHING IN A PARTICULAR WAY SYCLICY PREVENTILATION FOLLOWED BY RETENSION THE CATACOLA MENES NOR A DRENNALIN DOPEMING AND NOROPINEFRAN OR THE BRIDGE OF ACTIVATION FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THEY ARE THE WAY THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CALLS OUT TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AAH WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE NEED A COUNTER THIS SO YOU CAN THINK OF THEM THEM MEANING DOPAMINE EPINEFRAN AND NOROPINEFRAN AS BEING ABLE TO DEPLOY LARGER AMOUNTS OF IMMUNE CELLS ALL THE TYPES OF A MUNESALS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE OCAO THUS FAR WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING HOW ONE CAN PREVENT GETTING SICK OR WHEN WHEN STARTS TO FEEL ILL HOW ONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHORTEN THE COURSE OF THAT INFECTION BY RAMPING UP THE ACTIVITY OF THE IMUNE SYSTEM BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING SYMPTEMS THE RUNNI NOS STUFFED UP NOSE CONGESTION HEADACHE ET CETERA WELL THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT AT THE SYMPTEM LEVEL YOU PROBABLY AWARE OF ALL THE OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATIONS MANY OF WHICH FOCUS ON THE EPINEFRAN SYSTEM IN A THINGS THAT ARE OF THE SEUTOFED VARIETY PREVENT WILL REDUCE CONGESTION BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY CAUSE RELEASE OF EPINEFRAN AND SOME OF THE EFFECTS ON DILATING THE BRONCHIOLES AND DILATING THE NAZAL PASSAGES AND SO FORTH I'M NOT CAN A SPEAK TO WHETHER R NOT THOSE ARE GOOD OR BAD CHOICES THEY DO HAVE A COUPLE OF EFFACTS THAT ARE NOT SO GREAT FOR THE COURSE OF ON TREATING THE UNDERLYING CAUSE WHICH ARE FIRST OF ALL THEY CAN CAUSE DEHYDRATION SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HYDRATING WELL BOTH FLUIDS AN ELECTROLITES AND THEY ALSO CAN INTERFERE WITH SLEEP BECAUSE AS I 'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE EPISODE SON SLEEP ONE OF THE WHALL MARKS OF DEEP SLEEP AND IN PARTICULAR REMSLEEP IS THAT EPINEFRAN ADRENALINE LEVELS ARE LOW THIS IS WHAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE INTENSE OFTEN VERY EMOTIONALLY LAT IN DREAMS DURING REMSLEEP AND NOT ACT THOSE OUT A AND LO ADRENALINE EPINEFRAN DURING REMSLEEP AS A THE BASICALLY A SIGNATURE A NERCHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF THE REMSLEEP STATE WHICH IS SO VITAL FORTH EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL REPAIR AND SO FORTH SO THE FACT THAT THEY CAN INHIBIT SLEEP THE FACT THAT THEY CAN CAUSE DEHYDRATION THE FACT THAT THEY CAN MAKE P OPLE FEEL CON A LIGHTHEADED IN GITERY MAKES THEM NOT TERRIFIC CHOICES FOR A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE IS AN INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE CHOICE AND WHEN I SAY ALTERNATIVE I DO MEAN ALTERNATIVE A THE CHOICE IM REFERRING TO IS SPIRULINA WHICH IS ASHEA FORM OF ALGI A YEARS AGO I THINK WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT SPIRILINA IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH OF THE KIND OF A NINETEEN SEVENTIES EIGHTIES HEALTHFOOD A STORE VARIETY SEEM REALLY KIND OF A MISTICAL AND ENUACKY BUT ACTHIY NOW THERE SOME REALLINI STUDIES AND SOME DATA AND ALSO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISM BY WHICH SPIRILINA CAN HAVE POTENT EFFACTS IN REDUCING WHAT'S CALLED RHINITIS WHICH IS A FANCY WORD FOR A CONGESTION OF THE NOSE AND AN INFLAMMATION OF THE NOSE PASINALLY ANY TIME YOU  HERE THE A WORD THAT INCLUDES IDIS A AT LEAST OF ITS IN THE MEDICAL OR HEALTH CONTEXT THE GENERALLY MEANS INFLAMMATION OF SOME TISSUE A SO RHINIT IS JUST BEING INFLAMMATION OF THE NASAL PASSAGES BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SYMPTOMS OF ANY KIND OF INFECTION SO THERE TWO STUDIES I'D LIKE TO HIGH LIGHT A JUST VERY QUICKLY ONE IS A THE EFFECTS OF SPIRILINON ALERGIC RINITUS AND THE OTHERS A CLINICAL COMPARISON OF THE EFFICACY OF SPIRILA A SPIRILINA A PLATPLATENSIS THAT A TECHNICAL NAME AND SITITER AND SETERIZINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF LERGIC RINITUS A THESE LOOKED AT HUMANS SO THIS IS NOT A MOUS STUDY THIS A STUDY ON HUMANS A BOTH SEXES OR MAILES AN FEMALES A IN ONE CASE LOOKING AT A HUNDRED PLUS SUBJECTS HUNDER ANTWENTY ON SUBJECTS THE OTHER OR SIXTY FIVE SUBJECTS SO DECENT NUMBER OF SUBJECTS RANDOMIZE CHIL DOUBLE BLIND A BOTH CASES SAW SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN NASAL OBSTRUCTION IMPROVEDABILITY TO SMELL A IMPROVE SLEEP A DAILY WORKING SIDE OF KIND A HINPLAMATORY SID OF KINDS WERE REDUCED AS WELL A REDREDUCTION NASAL ITCHING ALL THE SUFTH YOU LIKE LIKE TO EXPERIENCE I  CAN IMAGIN AFTER TAKING TWO GRAHAMS TWO GRAHAMS NOT MILIGRAMS BUT TWO GRAHAMS OF SPIRILINA SOMETIMES HAD TO BE TAKEN FOR FOR A SHORT WHILE BEFORE A THE EFFECT KICKED IN SO THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE A I WOULD SAY BUT IT DOESN'TREALLY SPEAK TO MECHANISM BUT IN EXPLORING THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS FOR A SPIRILINA'S EFFECTS ON REDUCING A RHYNITIS IS INTERESTING TO FIND THAT SPIRULINA ACSHICAN INHIBIT THE FORMATION END OR ACTIVITY OF SO CALLED HISTEMINURGIC MAST CELLS AMAASTI MAST CELLS WE HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT ABOUT A MASSELLS BUT THEY ARE AN VERY INTERESTING SELLTYPE IN THE IMMUNERESPONSE A ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY ARE LITTLE PACKETS OF HISTEMINE AND WHEN WE HAVE A SOME SORT OF A INJURY OR A IRRITENT RATHER TO THE SKIN SO A MOSQUITO BIE FOR INSTANCE OR POISON OIKR POISON IVY A A SOMETHING THAT CAUSES AN ITCH OR SOMETHING THAT CAUSES INFLAMMATION INTERNALLY DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO BE ON THE SKIN THESE MASCELLS ARE THESE LITTLE BUBBLES THAT CONTAIN A HIS TO MEAN THAT GO TO THAT SITE AND RELEASE THEIR HISTOMANURGECT CONTENTS AND CAUSE SWELLING IN AN INFLAMMATION OF OF WHATEVER SELLS ARE AFFECTED LOCALLY AT CAUSE YOU MIGHT THINKWHY WOULD I ONT HAVE A MECHANISM IN MY BODY THAT WOULD CAUSE SWELLING AN INFLAMMATION A WILL THEN THOSE CELLS IN TURN SEND OUT SIDE A KIND SIGNALS THAT RECRUIT THE VERY SELLTYPES THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WAY BAKE THE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE THE SELLS THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE INNATE IMMIUNE SYSTEM THE COME IN THE MACROPHAGES AN THE OTHER A TYPES OF CELLS THAT WILL COME IN AND GOBBLE UP THE THE FOREIGN INVADERS OR A WILL HELP SEQUESTER AND MOVE AWAY SAY THE POISON FROM A BOIT OR FROM WHATEVER IRRITANT A AGAIN IT IT DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO BE AT THE SKIN SURFACE I'M DESCRIBING AN EXAMPLE OF OF AT THE SKIN FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'VE EVER HAD HIVES OF ANY KIND A THAT ALMOST CERTAINLY INVOLVED MAS CELLS SAND WHEN YOU TAKE AN ANTI HISTOMINE ANTIHISTOMINE IN ORDER TO A DEAL WITH SEESNALALOGIES FOR INSTANCE YOUR DEALING A YOUR YOURE EXCUSE ME YOUR TAKING A COMPOUND THAT'S REDUCING HISTMINES IN MAST CELLS AND SPIRULINA IS ALSO BEEN USED QUITE EFFECTIVELY AS A WAY TO TREAT A A SEASONAL ALOGIES AND SOME OF THE SYMPTIMOLOGY EQUALLY ON PAR WITH SOME OF THE MAJOR PRESCRIPTION AND OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS FOR THAT A ONE CAUTIONARY NOTE OF SPIRLINA DOES CAN CARRY SOME SIDE EFFECTS FOR PEOPLE O THAT ARE A HAVE A GENETIC MUTATION LEADING TO SOMETHING CALPIQE U THESE PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE THEIR VERY SENSITIVE TO A FENAL ALENINE HE SEEM PEOPLE CANNOT DRINK ANY SORT OF A NEUTRISREADER DIET SODA FOR FOR REASONS THAT THEY UNDERSTAND IT CON BE QUITE DANGEROUS IT'S A RARE GENETIC DISORDER BUT NONE THE LESS A SPIRLINA CAN A CAN BE AN ISSUE FOR THOSE PEOPLE A FOR MOST PEOPLE THE SIDE EFFECT FOR PROFILE IS IS PRETTY MINIMAL AND JUST TO BE CLEAR I DON'T HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO A SPIRLINA COMPANY OR ANYTHING JUST FINDIN INTERESTING THAT THERE ARE THESE COMPOUNDS THAT A SOUND RATHER A FORGIVE THE PHRASE BUT OF A RATHER NEW AG A BECAUSE THEY COME FROM A A ALGI FROM A PLANT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE  THAT'S OFTEN AN WHAT WE LIKE TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT IF THERE ARE THE SO CALLED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES A ALTERNTIVE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVEN'T HEARD OF THEM IT'S ALWAYS NICE IF THEY MAP TO A SPECIFIC LOGICAL MECHANISM AND FRAMEWORK BY WHICH THAT COMPOUND WOULD WORK HAS SUPPOSTED TO SOME ANECDOTE OF O I HEAR SPURLINA'S GREAT FEROLOGIES WELL NOW WE KNOW WHY IT INHIBITS MASCELLS AND HISTOMINURGIC MASCELLS IN PARTICULAR EARLIER I MENTION A NEW AND VERY EXCITING STUDY PUBLISH AS A FULL ARTICLE IN NATURE FULL ARTICLE MEANS THAT IT IS A MAJOR FINDING A IT AT THE JOURNAL NATURE THEY HAVE LETTERS WHICH ARE IMPORTANT FINDINGS THERE STILL VERY HIGHSTRINGENCY FOR GETTING A LETTER IN NATURE PUBLISHED A BUT THE FULL ARTICLES A GENERALLY THERE IS ONLY ONE OR TWO PER ISSUE A IN THE A WEEKLY ADDITION OF NATURE AND JUST LAST WEEK THERE IS A VERY EXCITING ARTICLE PUBLISHED FROM CHUFUMAS LAB AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL A CHUFU I'VE KNOWN FOR NUMBER OF YEARS HIS GROUP HAS DONE PHENOMENAL WORK ON THE MECHANISMS OF ITCH AND PAIN AND DISCOVERING SOME OF THE RECEPTORS AN PATHWAYS FOR ITCHAN PAIN AND MORE RECENTLY THEY'VE BEEN EXPLORING THE NECHANISTIC BASIS OF ACUPUNCTURE AND THE TITLE OF THE ARTICLE IS A NERROW ANATOMICAL BASIS FOR ELECTROACUPUNCTURE TO DRIVE THE VAGAL A DRENAL AXIS AND WHILE THAT'S A MOUTHFUL NOW MOST ALL OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY VAGAL ADRENAL AXIS VAGAL MEANING OF THE VAGUS AND A DRENAL OF THE ADRENAL GLANDS AND SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED ALTHOUGH EXCITED NONE THE LESS THAT WHEN CHUFU'SE LAB LOOKED AT STIMULATION OF THE BODY WITH SO CAL THE LECTROACUPUNCTURE SO THIS IS THESE ARE NEEDLES WHERE IT A SMALL BIT OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT LOW LEVEL ELECTRICAL CURRENT IS PASSED A INTO THE THE NEEDLE AND THEREFORE INTO THE BODY THEY LOCATED SITS ON THE BODY THAT CAN INCREASE INFLAMMATION BY WAY OF RELEASING IN FLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS THESE AREAS INCLUDED THE THE ABDOMAN AND THEY FOUND AREAS ON THE BODY SUCH AS THE A LOWER LIMBS THE HIND LIMBS IN THIS CASE THAT CAN STIMULATE THE VAGAL ADREAL REFLEX A AND CAN LEAD TO REDUCED INFLAMMATION AND WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT THEY FIGURED OUT THAT IT WAS ACTIVATION OF NERVE ENDINGS THAT RESIDED IN THE FASIA I MENTION EARLIER WHAT FASHAS BUT JUST TO REMIND YOU THE FASIA IS A A REALLY THICK SHEATH OF TISSUE THAT SURROUNDS MUSCLE IF EVER YOU'VE HEARD OF ROLFING ROLFING IS A A FORM OF VERY INTENSE MISSAGE HAVE NEVER HAD THIS DONE BUT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS IT'S A A IT INVOLVES AMONG OTHER THINGS ACH SEPARATING THE MUSCLE AWAY FROM THE ASIA SOMEWHAT SO IT'S HA VERY VERY DEEP TISSUE MISSAGE ACHE A GOOD FRIEND OMINE WHO A HAD THAT THIS DONE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST CHALLENGING OF EXPERIENCE THAT PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE THAT HEAD EVER BEEN THROUGH GOING THROUGH THIS ROLFHING PRECEDURE MAY BE SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN ROLFED AS THEY SAY AND CAN REPORT TO OF THE EXPERIENCE WHETHER NOT IT WAS PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT OR YOU FELT BENEFITS OR NOT IN ANY CASE THIS STUDY ISN'T ABOUT ROLFING PERSEY BUT IT IS ABOUT THE FASIA AND SO WHAT THEY DISCOVERED IS THEREIS A SPECIFIC POPULATION OF NURONS THOSE NRNS HAVE A NAME AS THEY OFTEN DO IN SCIENCE NAME ISN'T IMPORTANT BUT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK IT UP IT'S THE PROC ARE TO NERONS PIARO KE ARTUNERONS AND THEY SEND A CONNECTION DEEP INTO THE LIMB FASHIAL TISSUE OCAND THEN THEY SEND ANOTHER CONNECTION THE CONNECTIONS ITREFERRING TO OUR AX ONS NOR ONS HAVE AXS ON SO WIRE IN ONE DIREXION A THAT GOES INTO THE DEEP FASHAL TISSUE OF THE THE LOWER LIMB ANEAR THE CALF AND THIGH AND THEND THEY SEND ANOTHER WIRE UP INTO THE SPINAL CORD AND TO A RESION OF THE HIND BRAIN A IN THE BACYUR BRINCO YEAR YOUR NECK CALLED THE MEDULA IN THE MEDULA OBLANGATA THAT NERON ALSO HAS A NAME CALLED THE DEEMZE DOES 'T ATTER AND THAT NERON  CONNECTS TO THE ADDREMAL GLAND TO RELEASE OUR GOOD OLD FRIENDS THE CATACOLAMENES NOR ADRENALIN ADRENALIN AND DOPAMIN OR NOR APINEFERAN EPINEFERAN AND AND DOPAMINE AND THEIR RELEASE CAUSES A REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATION EVEN IN RESPONSE TO AN INJECTION OF SOMETHING OLIPPIPOLY SACARIDE WHICH CANNECTALLY INDUCE FEVERS SO WHAT IS ALL THIS SAYING THIS IS SAYING THAT ACTIVATION OF THE DEEP FATIAL TISSUE CAUSE IS A CHAIN OF NOURAL REACTIONS THAT LEADS EVENTUALLY TO THE RELEASE OF NORPANEFR NOR GENTALINE ADRENALIN AND DOPAMNE AND ONCE AGAIN LOWERS INFLAMMATION VERY MUCH LIKE THE BRIATHING STUDY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN THE PATTERN OF SYCLY CYPROVENTILATION WITH PRETENSION LEADING TO REDUCTIONS AND INFLAMMATION I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY THIS MAKES ME I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WORK BUT THE REASON IT MAKES ME HAPPY IS BECAUSE I HAVE A PARTICULAR FONDNESS FOR WHEN PRACTICES THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR MANY CENTURIES OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF YEARS SUCH AS ACUPUNCTURE SUCH AS RESPIRATION WORK START TO CONVERGE WITH SOME OF THE HARDCORE MECHANISTIC SCIENCE AND THE REASON THIS EXCITES ME IS NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO TAKE SCIENCE AN ERACE THE PREVIOUS TOOLS AND METHODS OF THESE ANCIENT PRACTISEIS NOT AT ALL AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T THE CASE THAT WE JUST WANT TO NAME THINGS OR RENAME THINGS WITH MODERN SCIENCE WHAT'S VERY EXCITING IS WHEN WE CAN DISCOVER MECHANISM THAT EXPLAINS WHY CERTAIN PRACTICES WORK FIRST OF ALL THAT VALIDATES THOSE AS LEGITIMATE PRACTICES MAYBE EVEN INSURANCE WILL START TO COVER THEM WHEREAS MAY BE THEY PREVIOUSLY HAD NOT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT STATUSES FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE OF ACUPUNCTURE MAY I'M GUESSING THERE ARE PLACES THAT DO IT MAY BE OTHERS IT DON'T I PERSONALY AM NOT A SOMEBODY WHO RECEIVES ACUPUNCTURE I HAVE IN THE PASS BUT I'M  IT'S NOT THAT I AM A PARTICULAR A FAN OF IT BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT BENEFITED FROM ITS I THINK THAT'S WONDERFUL A BREATH WORK AND RESPIRATION WORK I IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE A CULTIVATE S A PRACTICE OVER THE YEARS I MENTIONED EARLIER HOW I USE IT TO A PUSHBACK ON INCOMING INFECTIONS AND SO FORTH AND NOW THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE TOTAL THE YOU KNOW LIKE JUST A FIGUMENT IF MY IMAGINATION THERE S ACHEA MECHANISM PUBLISHD MECHANISM TO EXPLAIN IT BUT THE MOST EXCITING THING TO ME ABOUT ALL THIS IS THAT PRACTICES THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN SHROUDED IN COMPLICATED LANGUAGE OR WERE TE UNIQUE DOMAIN OF THE PRACTISSIONERS AND RELIED ON PHRASES LIKE THE MERIDIANS OR THE CHACARAS OF WHICH I THINK IS PERFECTLY VALID LANGUAGE BUT DOESN'T INFORM MECHANISM AND THEN IN A SEPARATE COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY I COME FROM THE COMMUNITY OF SCIENTISTS HAVE USE LANGUAGE LIKE PRAR TO NERON'S MADULA OBLINGAD O VEGOLADRENAL AXIS AND THEYSICLY NO ONE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE THE LANGUAGEOUS SHROUDING WHAT WE'RE NOW STARTING TO SEE IS THAT AT THEIR CONVERGENCE IS A COMMON MECHANISM AND WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY TERRIFIC IS AS NEW PROTOCAL START TO EMERGE SO IN UNDERSTANDING MECHANISMS AND PATHWAYS AND IN BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE THE BASE SET OF PRACTICES LIKE BREATHING LIKE ELECTRACUPUNCTURE AND SO FORTH WE CAN NOW START TO DAY DREAM IN A VERY REALISTIC WAY ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROTOCOLS MORE EFFECTIVE PROTOCALS PROTOCALLS THAT PERHAPS ONE CAN DO AT HOME WITHOUT NEEDLES PERHAPS PROTOCALLS US SUCH AS THE BREATHING THAT YOU CAN DO ANYWHERE ANY TIME AND AND BE CONFIDENT THAT YOUR ACTUALLY IMPACTING THE ISLE SIC IN THE ISLE A PATHWAYS REDUCING THOSE IN INCREASING ISLE TEN SO WE ARE NO LONGER WANDERING AROUND IN THE FOG HEARING ABOUT THESE MAGICAL TECHNIQUES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY WORK NOR ARE WE JUST SEEING A MUNCH OF SCIENCE THAT A IS DESCRIPTIVE BUT NOT MECHANISTIC OR POINTING TO SPECIFIC PROTOCALS SO I'M JUST DELIGHTED AGAIN I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WORK BUT I REALLY AN A TERRIFIC A WORK TUFU AND COLLEAGUES AND A AND ALSO ANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A JOURNAL AS PROMINENT IS NATURE FOR A FUTURING THIS A APFRONT BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY DOES MARK THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PATH IN MEDICINE AND JUST TO UNDERSCORE THAT POINT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH OF COURSE HAS A CANCER INSTITUTE AND I INSTITUTE THE DEAL WITH TRYING TO COMBAT CANCER AND TO A CURE BLINDNESS AND SO FORTH AND NOW THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED AND C C I H WHICH IS COMPLIMENTARY HEALTH AND SO THERE ARE GOOD TAX DOLLARS BEING PUT TO THE KINDS OF EXPLORATIONS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT UNDOUBTEDLY ARE GOING TO LEAD TO BETTER TREATMENTS FOR IN MUNOLOGICAL DISEASES NOR A LOGICAL DISEASES THE CONVERGENCE OF THE UMUNE SYSTEM IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM VERY EXCITING TIMES AND I HOPE THAT BY LEARNING ABOUT SOME OF THIS NEW AND EMERGING SCIENCE AND HEARING ABOUT SOME OF THE PROTOCALLS THAT ARE EITHER ZERO COST OR LOW COST CERTAINLY FOR RESPIRATION THAT'S THE CASE OR FOR THE USE OF HEAT OR COLD OR I MAYBE EVEN ELECTORACUPUNCTURE IF YOU HAVE ACTS ESS TO THAT THAY WE CAN REALLY SEE THAT WE'RE STARTING TO EVOLVE AS A FIELD OF HEALTH AND MEDICIN AND SCIENCE AND ANTION PRACTICSYSAND THAT THEYARE REALLY STRYING TO CONVERGE AND HAVE A VECTOR AS WE SAY IN A NEW AND MORE EXCITING DIRECTION ONCE AGAIN WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF INFORMATION TO DAY WE LEARNED ABOUT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THE ADAPTIV EMUNE SYSTEM THE INNATE IMUN SYSTEM AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HOW THOSE INTERACT AND THROUGHOUT WE DISCUSS PROTOCALLS THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO TAP INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AN EMIUNE SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY AVOID ENDOR SHORTEN THE COURSE OF ANY ILLNESSES INJURIES OR INFLAMMATION

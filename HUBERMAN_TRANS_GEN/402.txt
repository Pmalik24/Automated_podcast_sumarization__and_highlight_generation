WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPPONKES O SCIENCE SCIENCE PACS TO  FRLIFE I M ENJER HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBILOGY AND OPTHYMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR ROBIN CARHART HARRIS DOCTOR CARHAR HARRIS IS A DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF NEUROLOGY AND PSYCHIETRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PSAN FRANCISCO HE IS ONE OF THE LEADING RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHODELICS AND HOW THEY CHANGE NEURAL CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN HIS LABORATORY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR UNDERSTANDING FOR INSTANCE HOW SYLICIBEN ALSO SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS MAGIC MUSHROOMS CHANGE NEURAL CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN SUCH THAT NEW IDEAS AND NEW FORMS OF LEARNING OCCUR IS LABORATORY IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING OUT VARIOUS CLINICAL TRIALS SOME OF WHICH HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT APPROPRIATE DOSAGES OF SYLICIBEN CAN ALLEVIATE MAJOR DEPRESSION IN MORE THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE DRUG NOW THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD TAKE SYLICIBEN AND TODAY'S DISCUSSION DESCRIBES BOTH THE CLINICAL TRIALS AND WHY TREATMENTS WITH PSYCHODELICS IN SOME CASES WORK AND IN SOME CASES DO NOT WORK IN ORDER TO TREAT MAJOR DEPRESSION AS WELL AS DISCUSSIONS AROUND SYLICIBEN LISERGAGACI DIETHLEMIDE SOMETIMES ALSO REFERRED TO AS ELS D AS WELL AS D M T AND HOW THESE CHANGE THE BRAIN AND HOW THOSE BRAIN CHANGES CAN RELATE TO CHANGES IN MENTAL HEALTH AS IT RELATES TO DEPRESSION AND OTHER PSYCHEATRIC CHALLENGES AS WELL AS HOW PSYCHODELICS ARE BEING APPLIED IN ORDER TO CHANGE NERAL CIRCUITRY FOR SAKE OF EXPANDING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE HUMAN MIND INCLUDING CREATIVITY INTELLIGENCE AND MUCH MORE DURING TO DAY'S DISCUSSION DOCTOR CARHART HARRIS TEACHES US ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE STUDY OF PSYCHODELICS AS WELL AS HOW THE LEGISLATURE THAT IS THE LAWS SURROUNDING PSYCHODELICS ARE EVOLVING IN TE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE FOR THE USE OF PSYCHODELICS TO TREAT PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES BY THE END OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU WIL HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PSYCHODELIC'S WORK BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM DURING THE ACTUAL JOURNEY OR TRIP IN FACT MUCH OF MY DISCUSSION TODAY WITH DOCTOR CARHART HARRIS TALKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY AND HOW THOSE RELATE TO THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES AND OF COURSE BY THE END OFTODAS DISCUSSION YOU WILL ALSO UNDERSTAND THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF PSYCHODELICS THAT IS HOW THEY CAN ACTUALLY REWIRE THE BRAIN BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE T EMPHASIZE AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME ID LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANTS ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACKTOLECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THATS ONE GRAHM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEMENT DOCOM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR ROBIN CARHART HARRIS DOCTOR CARHART HARRIS WELCOME I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK YOU FOR A LONG TIME I CERTAINLY KNOWN WHO YOU ARE FOR QUITE A WHILE BECAUSE I PLACE YOU IN THIS VERY SMALL A VERY SPECIAL AN IMPORTANT CATEGORY OF RESEARCHERS WHO HAS BEEN PIONEERING THE USE OF PSYCHODELICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC CLINICAL CONDITIONS AND REALLY ON CARYING THE TORCH FOR ESSENTIALLY THE ENTIRE FIELD SO WHAT A STORIT WITH THE A VOICE OF GRATITUDE AND SA THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK COULD YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT PSYCHODELICS ARE IFACT IM CURIOUS AS TO HOW THE NAME PSYCHODELIC EVER CAME TO BE AND WHAT YOU THINK THEY POTENTIALLY REVEAL ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF THE BRAIN AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS SO WELL  EVEN THAT ONE IS A IS A CUNNOR HOT ONE BECAUSE A OPINIONS DIFFER ON HOW TO DEFINE PSYCHEDELIC BUT PERHAPS A GOOD STARTING PLACE IS TO START WITH THE ATYMOLOGY WHERE DID THE WORD COME FROM AND IT WAS A BRIT EXCOMMUNICATED AND LIVING IN IN CANADA HUMPHRY OSMENT HE AT WAS DUE TO PRESENT O A PAPER AT A NATIONAL ACADEMY OF PSCIENCES MEETING ON PSYCHOTOMEMATICS DRUGS THAT MIMIC ASPECTS OF PSYCHOSIS IN THEIR ACTION AND CERTAIN DRUGS LIKE MESCULINE AN SEE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX AND ELESTIN AT WELL ON ON THE BILL AND HA HE FELT DISSATISFIED WITH THEM BEING UNDER THIS CATOCREE OF PSYCHOTOMEMATICS AND FELT THAT THE SIGNATURE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THESE COMPOUNDS WENT BEYOND JUST MIMICING PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS AND SO HE WANTED TO FIND EM OR APT TURM TO SPEAK TO IN A SENSE THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF THEIR ACTION AND AT HE JOTTED DOWN A FEW DIFFERENT A POSSIBILITIES ABOUT US IN ORSO I THINK AND ONE OF THEM WAS PSYCHODELICATUALLY HAS STARTED T AS AN ENDED UP BEING PSYCHEDELIC AND HAT HE HAD A CORRESPONDENCE GOING ON WITH ANOTHER BR IT ALSO LIVING IN THE ES ORDER PSYCLY A WHERE THEY WERE PLAYING WITH SOME  TEMS TO REFER TO THESE COMPOUNDS AND AND TE IN THE END THER OSMOND ONE WIT PSYCHE DELIC AND HE HAD THIS LITTLE DITTY AFIM TO FATHOM HELL OR SAW ANGELIC JUST TAKE A PINCH OF PSYCHEDELIC A THAT'S WE FOR THE DISCLA AN AND SO AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT'S TO ANCIENT GREEK WORD PSYCHE MEANS THE HUMAN MIND OR IF WEE BEING A AS SHE TRUE TO THE ANCIENT GREEK IT MEANS SOUL AN AND THEN THE OTHER COMPONENT A MEANS TO MAKE CCLEAR OR TO MAKE VISIBLE OR TO MAKE MANIFEST OR TO REVEAL TO ALL OF THOSE WORK AND AND IT'S IT'SN'T NEOLOGISM IT'S A MADE UP WORD BUT IT DOES HAVE THAT ANCIENT GREEK ORIGIN AND IT'S SPEAKING TO THIS PRINCIPLE THAT THESE COMPOUNDS REVEAL ASPECTS OF THE PSYCHE OF THE HUMAN MIND THE SOUL THATE ORDINARILY NOT ENTIRELY VISIBLE AN AND SO THAT'S YET YMOLOGY AND IT'S WONDERFULLY POETIC BUT I HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S ALSO VERY ACCURATE IT'S A A USEFUL TERM BECOUSE ITS SORT OF YOU MIGHT SAY VAILANCE NON SPECIFIC IT DOESN'T SAY O CAN HAVE A GREAT TIME OR THA YOU GONG TO GO MAD AIT'S MORE THAT IT REVEALS PSYCHE AND IT COULD BE HELLISH BUT IT COULD BE HEAVENLY AN AND A SO THAT'S THE ATOMOLOGY AND ALSO BIT OF THE PSYCHOLOGY AN ANE IN I POINTING TO THE PHENOMENOLOGY THE PSUBJECT OF EXPERIENCE BUT THERE'S ALSO A PHARMACHOLOGY HERE AND QUITE RECENTLY THERE WAS PUT OUT AY CONSENSO STATEMENT ABOUT PSYCHE DELICS THE REALLY REFERRING TO WHAT WE CALL THE CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS TO SAY THAT THESE ARAL COMPOUNDS THAT WORK ON A PARTICULAR RECEPTOR IN THE BRAIN THE CERETURN INTO A RECEPT A AND THAT'S IN NOT THE WAY THAT WE CUL DEFINE THESE COMPOUNDS I SAID THIS ONE'S A LITTLE HOT BECAUSE I'M OF THE VIEW THAT WHILE THE PHAMACOLOGY IS REALLY USEFUL HOW THE DRUGS WERE CHAMICALLY YOU CAN'T AVOID THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND IF WE TRUTS THE ATIMOLOGY WHERE THE TUM CAME FROM THAN WE MUST RECOGNIZE AD WE CANNOT NEGLECT THE PSUBJECTS OF EXPERIENCE THANK YOU FOR THAT A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT BROUGHT US TO TO DAY IN TERMS OF USING THE WORD PSYCHODELICS AND NOW ITS THROWN AROUND ALL THE TIME YET TOO MUCH YETE TOO MUCH AND AND I'M GUESSING UM ON NO GUESSING I'M CERTAIN THAT IT'S I ALSO USED TO DESCRIBE MANY COMPOUNDS THAT DON'T TOUCH THE FIVE AGH TO IF IH'VE EACH TEA TO A THE CERETONE INTO A RECEPTOR SO AM THERE IS A BROADER CATEGRIZATION BY MOST PEOPLE AND AM WE INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE ALL THE NOMING CLATURE NAMING GOES FOR THE TIME BEING ID LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT PSYCHODELICS HOWEVER ONE DEFINDS THEM CAN REVEAL SOMETHING ABOUT THE MIND THAT CAN'T BE REVEALED OTHERWISE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE PSUBCONSCIOUS I MEAN THE YOU KNO PSYCHOLOGISTS AND MAST FAMOUSLY FROID BUT ALSO YOUNG AND ALL ALSO NOURAL PSCIENTISTS I THINK I'M THINK ABOUT SUBCONSCIOUS PROCESSING I THINK PERHAPS THE MOST SAILINT EXAMPLE FOR ME THAT'S OUTSIDE THE REALM OF OF UM ANYTHING PSYCHODELIC WOULD BE BLIND SIGHT THIS PHENOMENA THA YOU TAKE PEOPLE THAT ARE BLIND BUT STILL HAVE SOME CONNECTIVITY IN THEIR BRAIN AND YOU PRESENT THEM AND ABORD WITH I COMPUTER SCREENE WITH DIFFERENT NUMBER OF DOTS ON EACH SIDE YEU SAY HOW MANY DOTS ARE ON EACH SIDE OF THE SCREEN THEY SAY WHAT YOU MEAN I CAN'T SEE THE SCREAN AN BLIND ESIT WOULD JUST GASS AND THEIR GASRATE IS ACCURATE FAR MORE THAN CHANCE WOULD WOULD PRODECTION SO THEY HAVE SO CALLED BLIND SIGHT AND PEOPLE OF SAID WELL THIS IS THE SUBCONSCIOUS REVEALING ITSELF AN THERE'S NO SECOND ELL WA DRUG INVOLVED BUT WHAT YOUARE DESCRIBING IS A FORMICAL OBJECT INDU STATE THAT REVEAL SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY OW SHOULD WE ASSUME IS MASKED OR THAT WE ARE OBLIVIOUS TO A EVEN THOUGH IT'S EXPRESSING ITSELF BUT WHAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE DRUGS TO BE RE THE OU REVEALING SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF THE MIND THAT WOULD OULD NOT BE OBVIOUS TO US OTHERWISE YE SINCEO THE A EXAMPLE OF BLIND SIGHT IS INTERESTING BUT IT'S DIFFEREND BLIND SIGHT WOULD BE A REFERRING TO NUNCONSCIOUS PROCESSING MAY BE IMPLICIT PROCESSINGS A STUFF GOING ON IN THE MIND IMPERCEPTION IN A SENSE THAT IS BELOW THE THRESHOLD OF CONSCIOUS WERESS BUT YET ITS INFLUENCING E S ITS SORT OF  KIND OF RELATED BUT IT'S DIFFERENT SA IN IN DEPT PSYCHOLOGYPSYCHONALYSIS PSYCHODANOMIC PSYCHOLOGY AN A SIGMANFROID CALO AND SO ON AN WE TAK ABOUT THE UNCONSCIOUS A AND THAT IT'S MORE ABOUT THE KIND OF BLOOD AN GOT O THE HUMAN CONTITION WIT HUMAN NATURE BI THE PERSONAL UNCONSCIOUS AY THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO NECESSARILY BE CONSCIOUS OF CAUSE IT'S PAINFUL SA THAT THAT'S THE REPRESSION ASPECT PUSHING IT OUT OF CONSCIOUS WHERAS REPRESSED MEMORIES AND PARTICULAR YE LIKE DRAMATIC MEMORIES A DIFFICUL A RELATIONSHIPS O COULD BE COMPLEX TROMAN NOTNASSARY JUST THE SPECIFIC IN A INDEX TROMABUT A SERIES OF TROMAN AN AND YOU HAVE THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS WHICH IS REALLY CAL YOUNGS CONTRIBUTION TO SAY THAT AM IN A THERES A TRANSPERSONAL QUALITY TO THE UNCONSCIOUS THIS ASPECTS ABOUT HUMAN NOT JUST THIS INDIVIDUAL HUMAN A THEES ASPECTS TO OUR MON OUR MINDS ARE PSYCHES THAT A AM NOT FULLY AVAILABLE TO CONSCIOUS AWARENES SPOKEN COME UP IN SERTAIN STATES IN A PSYCHONALYSIS WHENT CRAZY FOR DREAMING AS AS THER ROYAL ROAD TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS THAT WAS FROID AM BUT A WE NOW KNOW WITH PSYCHODHELICS AND THIS WAS WHAT DREAMY INTO THE AREA WAS DISCOVERING LITERATURE AM THAT WER SPEAKING TO THIS PARTICULAR ACTION THE PSYCHE DELICACTION AND WIT SAYING THAT WHEN THESE DRUGS LYCELESTY PSALESYBEN IFAUNDIMAGIMUSHIANS AM WHEN THEYE USED IN INPSYCHOTHERAPY AM MATERIAL COMES UP THE MAY BE MAY HAVE BEEN REPRESSED AM THE THE TA IS OF IN A THERAPETIC VALY AN AWARENESS AN INSIGHT OF THIS MATERIAL SEEMS TO CATALIZE THE TERAPEUTIC PROCESS WITH N A STRONG EMOTIONAL RELEASE THESE CATHATIC EXPERIENCES AND A AN INSIHTS YOU KNOW WHETHER THER IN PSYTS E THE PERSONAL AM OR WHETHER THE TRANSPERSONAL AM BUT A FOR ME THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE MEET OF IT IS WITH PSYCHODELICS AND CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS IN PARTICULAR THE LIKES OF COMPOUND PSYCAS ALESTEAN AN PSALESYBON I WOULD SAY THAT IF IT WAS AN FOR THIS ACTION BY CLASSIC PSYCHEDELICS WE WOULDN'T BE SO INTERESTED IN PSYCHODELICS I I THINK WE ONLY HAD COMPOUNDS LIKE CATAMIAN EMDIMAY CANABIST ODOES THE COULD BE SAID BROADLY SPEAKING TO BE PSYCHODELIC LIKE I DON'T THINK IT NECESSARY WOULD HAVE CAPTURED THE WELL ETENTION IS PSYCHODELICS ARE RIGHT NOW I ADYOTHING IS A MAJOR GAPS OF PHIL IS THIS PRINCIPAL ACTION OF THE COSSIC PSYCHODELICS WHAT DOES WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THAT I'M REFERRING TO PSYCHE REVEALING WHAT IS THAT AND ISPOSE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS IS WHAT IS THAT IN TERMS OF THE BIOAGY AS WELL WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BRAIN AND THE BODY WHEN PEOPLE BECOME AWARE OF THINGS THE PREVIOUSLY THEY WEREN'T FULLY AWAREO I'DE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH I'M IN PARTICULAR LOOKING AT SYLISIBON THE AS YOU MENTION THE PRINCIPAL HALLUSE HALLUCINATORY PSYCHODELIC AGENT IN MAGIC MUSHROOMS I'M ID LIKE TO START WITH A KIND OF NUTS AND BOLTS QUESTION I'M JUST SAI THAT EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE I'VE READ THE PAPERS THAT YOU'VE PUBLISHED IN THE OTHERS AVE PUBLISHED IN THIS AREA AND TYPICALLY ON THE DOSAGES HE USED IN THESE TRIALS ARE TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS OF SYLISIBON AND WE TALK ABOUT ONE RECENT TRIAL IN PARTICULAR THAT COMPARED TWENTY FIVE TO TEN MILIGRAMS TO MORE FREQUENT USE OF VERY SMALL AMOUNTS ONE MILIGRAM OVER THREE WEEKS FOR INSTANCE HOWEVER WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MAGIC MUSHROOMS THEY OFTEN TALK ABOUT GRAHM DOSES OF THE MUSHROOM BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY CONTAIN MILIGRAM DOSAGES OF SYLICIBON HERE WE'RE NOT AM ENCOURAGING A USE OF ANY KIND THES ARE CLINICAL TRIALS BUT FOR THE'M CLARITY OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS THE CONVERSION TYPICALLY LIKE ONE GRAHM OF MAGIC MUSHROOMS WILL CONTAIN HOW MANY MILIGRAMS OF SYLISIBAN ON AVERAGE BECAUSE OF WHAT I WANT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE IS IS CALEBRATE PEOPLE TO THIS IDEA OF MICRODOSING VERSES MACRODOSING AND THAT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO DO WITH RESPECT TO THE CLINICAL TRIALS BUT THEN IN THE THE LOT OF THE LAY DISCUSSION AROUND THIS YOU HEAR ABOUT HEROICODOSES VERSES MICRODOSES AND SO HIGHTHING THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION SO IF YOU WOULD AM EDUCATE US ON THIS A IDEA OF WHAT'S A MICRODOSE AND PERHAPS ALSO HOW MANY MILIGRAMS OF SYLICIBON ARE CONTAINED IN A GRAHAM OF COIN QUOT MAGIC MUSHROOMS SO WAT A MICRODISE IS SNEITHER OF THESE O THAT SIMPLE TETHE FA IT'S A FUN CHALLENGE A MICRODIE ONE DEFINITION IS THAT IT'S A DISE OOF TYPICALLY A CLASSIC PCYCHODELIC LIKE ELESTY OR SALECIBON AN THAT IS ATHAT HAS SOME PERCEPTABLE PSYCHODELIC EFFECTS SYCHE IT DOESN'T PUT YOU INTO A NOTICEABLE TO STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT FEELS LIKE YOUR TRIPPING AN AND IF THAT WAS ELISTY IT LOOKS AS I THE THRESHOLD IS AROUND ABOW THAT SE ITEN ELEVEN TWELVE MICROGRAM MICROGR MIC CRO ON RA VERY CLEARLAROGA SOBE TAND SO TEN MICROGRAMS OF ELISTY ARE YOU SAYING WILL NOT INDUCE VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS IN MOST PEOPLE SO IT'S IT'S THAT'S THRESHOLD LEVEL TAN'S ABOUT THE LEVEL THAT THAT SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE SENSITIVE COULD FEEL IT BUT IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO THE A MICRODISINGCYRIS THEY MIGHT SAY THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE BLL PART FOR ANELESTYDISE THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER A MICRODISE AND THEN YOU WOULD TAKE SO THE SEMI REGULARLY IT'S TYPICALLY SOMETHING LIKE ONE DAY ON ONE DAY OFF FOR ONE DAY ON TWO DAYS OFF THIS KIND OF THING THEE'S DIFFERENT PRITYCL S AND AND YES SO IN AT SOME LIK JIM FADAMAN AN A ONE OF THE POPULAR ISERS OF MICRODISING I THINK WOULD SAY THE A TRUE MICRODISE SHOULD BE SUBPERCEPTIBLE YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL IT YET THE ASSUMPTION IS IT'S GOING TO CHANGE YOU IN SOME WAY ONE A KIND OF TRAIT LEVEL MORE THAN A STATE LEVEL AND AN MAYBE BEHAVORLY AND AND THE TYPICAL STORY GOES IT WOR IMPROVE WELL BEING AN MAYBE MAYBE IT COULD IMPROVE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF COGNITION SAY RELATED TO CREATIVE THINKING AND I EMPHASIZE THE MAYBE THERE BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER ANGLE WITH MICRODISING WITH KIND OF WAITING FORCE AND COMPELLING EVIDENCE AS THINKS STANDRIGHT NOW I SAY WE LACK AN THAT COMPELLING EVIDENCE TI SOME SUGGESTIVE STUFF BUT OFTEN THE STUDY DESIGNS ON THAT STRONG IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO A STUDY WITH MICRODISING BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAVE PERMISSION TO GIVE PEOPLE A MICRODISE TO IN IT A PRACTICAL REASONS THEY WOULD GO HOME WITH AND AN OTHERWISE YOU YOUR REQUIRING THEM TO BE IN THE LAB SAY THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR EX NUMBER OF WEEKS TO MEET THE CRITERIA OF A COURSE OF MICRODISING WHICH MY BE YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK TO SAY A MONTH AND THAT'S A HARD THING TO DO IN A LAD STUDY ITS EXPENSIVE YOU NEED TO DO THAT AGAINST TAY SUITABLE CONTROL TO A PLECEED BY CONTROL AND THERE IS A STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE IN NEW ZEALAND AND THAT HAS SOME INTERESTING PRELIMINARY DATA THE DID I THINK CAN IT DID THE DESIGN RIGHT AND BUT I HASN'T BE PUBLISHED YET AND I'VE SEEN SOME POSITIVE FINDINGS PRESENTED AROUND IMPROVEMENTS IN INMOVED BUT IT'S A BIT EARLY  TO GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND TES TE GITRY PEROFUAN OR THAT AN BUT AS THINGS STAND YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE IS PRETTY THIN AND AND AN WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT WE DID QUITE A CREATIVE STUDY O WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT IMPERIAL THE GUY LEADING THAT BALASHE AS SHEGETY HUNGARIAN CHAP AND DID REALLY CREATIV DESIN VERY MUCH HIS BRAIN CHILTY AND INSTRUCTED PEOPLE TO DO THEIR OWN BLINDING THERE ON'T PLECE BY CONTROLLED BLINDING OF THEIR OWN MICRODISING SO THIS WAS A CLASSIC CITIZEN SCIENCE STUDY LIKE DO IT YOURSELF SCIENCE WHERE THEY WOULD GET THEIR ELESTESI THAVES IN CHOPE THEM UP PUT THEM INTO JA CAPTALS I PAQUE AND HAVE OTHER CAPTALS THAT THE PLECE BOS THAT THEY JUST CLOSE EMPTY CAPTAL AND THEN THOWS A WHOLE BARCODE SCAN TECHNIQUE CAR SO THAT YOU YOU CAN'T SHUFFLE THEM UP BUT THEY'VE GOT THE BARCODE IN THE CUARCODE SO YOU CAN BREAK THE COD LATE TO RAN BUT ONCE HE'VE SHUFFLE THEM UP YOU NO LONGER NOW WHICH ONE HAD HAVE THE THE MICRODISYAN ON WHICH ONE ARE EMPTY WAS A ZEALOUSTY IS WA SELOSTY ALSO TRIED IT WITH MUSHROOMS BUT THE ISSUES WITH THE MUSHROOMS WHAS PEOPLE WOULD BURT SOMETIME TE BELCH AND THEN THEYD HAVE TIS MUSHROOM TASTE SO THEN INSTRUCTED PEOPLE TO GET SOME I NON PSYCHOACTIVE MUSHROOM MATERIAL TO PERINSIS REALLY OT AN EASY STUDY NOT AN EASY STUDY AND AND THA IT WAS I LOVE THAT KIND OF SCIENCE IN A REAL CREATIV FIRST MOVE A KIND OF SCIENCE AND THE RESULTS O FASCINATING BECAUSE SIM THE SHORT STORY IS THAT THE MICRODOSING DIDN'T AND COMPELLINGLY BEAT THE PLECE BYLONAT IT DIDN'T AND HE CONTROLLED BECAUSE HE ASKED I HE CONTROLLED FOR EXPECTANCY SAID PEOPLE WAS POSITIVE EXPECTANCY WHICH IS IN A SENSE THE VEHICLE THAT CARRIES THE PLACY BY RESPONSE IT'S WHY YOU HAVE A PLACY BY IS THE POSITIVE EXPECTANCY CONTRIVE  THE REPEATIC EFFECT TO YOU KNOW A LARGE EXTENT SO HE MEASURED THAT PRE TRIAL AND THEN USED IT TO KIND OF CORRECT FOR THE RESPONSE AND HADIT IT WORE THOSE WHO GOT A PLECE BY BUT THOUGHT THEY GOT A MICRODISE DID AS WELL AS THOSE WHO THOUGHT THEY GOT MICRODISE AND DID GET A MICRODISE SAY IT WAS THE BIGGER EFECT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE EFFECT WAS IN THINKING THAT YOU GOT A MICRODISE SO IN TA SENSE IT WAS A VICTORY FOR THE POWER OF THE PLAC BY RESPONSE AND IT'S CREATED ALL SORTS OF CONTROVERSY PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF SCIENSE ISN'T THAT THAT SCIENCE IS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE BEAUTY OF SCIENCE READY I LOVE THAT EXPERIMENT A CUDOS TO THEM I'M NOT GOING TO ATTEMPT TO SAY HIS LAST NAME I I  I E WEN YOU MAD AMUSNOT I I THINK YOU YOU GOT IT AM YOU WERE INVOLVED IN A A CLENICAL TRIAL THAT WAS A PUBLISHED LAST YEAR COMPARING TWENTY FIVE MELIGRAMS OF I'M SYLICIBIN TO TEN MELIGRAMS OF SYLICIBAN IS A VERY IM TO A AT A DRUG CALLED A CI TALOPRIM YER YER LEXIPRO YESIPRO IM AND THIS ONE MELIGRAM OVER THREE WEEK AM DOSAGE I IN AM WANTING TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY A BIT I'M AND SOME OF THE OTHER TRIALS THAT YOU'VE DONE INVOLVING SYLICIBAN FOR DEPRESSION FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION I'M A COUL WE CALBRATE OURSELVES TWENTY FIVE MELIGRAMS OF SYLICIBON IS I IS THAT WHAT WOULDN'T WHAT ITS CAN BE A PERCEPTIBLE DOSE PRESUMABLY HOLLUSI N IS AN ALL THAT AND IS THAT OF WHAT ONE WOULD FIND IN A I'M GUESSING HERE IF I'M ACCURATE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCE HERE BUT A TWO TWO GRAHMS OF OF MY OL IS TAT A WE THINK YE SIRIA MISS THA TE OO MISTAVAN WEN OF FONITANGEN PERT YET TWENTY FIVE MILOGRAMS AS SOLICEI BEEN WOULD BE WE DON'T KNOW AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I SAY THAT BECAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO HEAR MY AUNTS AR HERE AND THEN USE IT TO CALIBRATE THE ARAINDISING MUSHROOMS AND GET IT WAY OFF SI ITS GUESS WORK AND I  LOVE TO SEE SOME ON TO PROPER STUDY ON IT AND YEI AM I LOOKAT THE OLICIBON CONTENT IN A GIVEN MASSI SYLOCOPY MUSHROOMS MAGIC MUSHROOMS BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN DONE AM SOME ONE LIKE POSE STAMITS RIDA WULD GIVE A BETTER ANSWER HERE BUT I THINK THE PERCENTAGE WITHIN THE MUSHROOM MASS IS SOME OF SOLISIBON IN THE MUSHROOM MASS AND SOLICIN WHICH IS METABOLITE OF SOLISIVON AND IS SOMETHING IN IN THE ONE PER CENT LITTLE BEIE MAY BE A RANGE OCASE SO ONE ONE GRAHAM ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF MAGIC MUSHROOM WOULD CONTAIN ABOUT TEN MILIGRAMS OF SYLISIVON I BROADLY SPEAKING E GREAT THAT HELPS CALIBRATE AN AND I THINK AGAIN JUST ALLOWS THE LAY PERSON TO UNDERSTAND A BIT MORE OF WERE WE'RE HEADED WITH THESE A SYLICIDIN OUR TRIALS AND AND THE RESULTS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO RESTRICT OUR DISCUSSION TO JUST THAT ONE CLENICAL TRIAL BUT IIF WE INCLUDE THAT ONE AND IN COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER TRALS THAT YOU'VE DONE I ME YOU RE LABORATORIES SEEING PHENOMENAL IN MY OPINION PHENOMENAL RESULTS IN THE TREATMENT OF A OTHERWISE INTRACTABLE DEPRESSION MAJOR DEPRESSION WHICH SO MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM FROM TO A I I SUPPOSE THEY'RE A TWO SESSIONS OF USING SYLISIBING IN THESE RANGES OF TEN TO TWENTY FIVE MELEGRAMS TO HAVE THAT CORRECT YES O C E COULD WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE DURING THOSE SESSIONS THAT ALLOWS THE PHENOMENAL TRANSFORMATION OF MOOD AND STATE AND TRAIT AS WELL AND I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WHETHER OR NOT IT IS THE EXPERIENCE DURING THOSE SESSIONS THAT IS THE TRIGGER THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THE THE TRANSFORMATION FROM A DEPRESSED TO A NON DEPRESSED STATE BECAUSE WI THE THE IMPULSES TO THINK IT IS THAT WHAT ONE THINKS AND SEES AND HALLUCINATESS AM AN HEARERS IS SO VITAL BUT OF COURSE THESE DRUGS CAN CREATE NORAL PLASTICITY CHANGES IN OUR NORAL WIRING PRESUMABLY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF AND MAYBE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT DONE THESE COMPOUNDS BEFORE YOU CULD EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S TYPICAL FOR PEOPLE AND WHAT YOU THINK IS LEADING TO THAT INCREDIBLE POSITIVE AND PERVASIVE CHANGE IN MOOD STATE AND TRIT IBUT IUTD SAY THAT ITS MORE THAN IMPULSE THAT IS AN LEADING US TO THINK THAT THE EXPERIENCES IMPORTAND IT'S REALLY DATA AND AND CONVARGING EVIDENCE NOW AM SO INDEPENDENTEENS INDEPENDENT STUDIES AR CONVAGING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF EXPERIENCE RATEIT YES WITH SUBJECTS I RITING SCALES IS PREDICTING THERAPE TO OUTCOMES PRETTY PRETTY STRONGLY AND VERY RELIVELY AM AND SO THAT'S GUIDING US NOW COULD YOU SAY WHATL MAYBE THER'S EXPERIENCES OF SOME KIND OF EPY PHENOMENON I SAY A SENTRAL BRAIN ACTION WET ABSOLUTELY BUT THEN ALL EXPERIENCE IS AN APPY PHENOMENON BY THAT PRINCIPLE AND YET WE CARE ABOUT IT EN A AND IT MATTERS A TO US AND IN OUR HUMAN RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER SO I THINK IT DOES MATTER TO A HUMAN BEING WHEN THEREIN A SAY A PSALICIDE AN THERAPESESSION AND AS THE DRUG EFFECTS BEGIN TO COME ON IN E BODY STARTS TO FEEL A LITTLE STRANGE AND TINKLY AND THER THES EM SOME INITIAL ANXIETY AND THEN IN THEIR MINXIE THEY START TO NOTICE PATERNS  MAY BE COLORS AND THEN MAY BE THOSE PATERNTS DEEPER AN THE DYNAMIC MAY HAVE THIS FASCINATING ORGANIC QUALITY OR THE UNPATIENCE IN OUR STUDIES TO BEGUSING E UM AND I MASK YER ASO THEY'REIN THE IMISIYES CLOLIE THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID MIND'S EYE I SUPPOSED TO LOOKING OUT INTO YES ANOTHERCAL OTA TE MAJE A DIFFERENCES TO PSYCHODELICTHERAPEVES IS TAKING A PSYCHOTELICIS YOU SHUT YOUR HIYES YOU KNOW AND IT'S A IT'S A WORLD AWAY FROM TAKING PSYCHODELIC YE AT A RAVE OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW IN A SENSE GOOD LUCKTHE AN BUT IN PSYCHODELIC THERAPY YEIT'S IT'S YOU KNOW AND SETTLED CONDITIONS AND THI'S MUSIC PLAYING IN ONE OF DESCRIBING HERE IS VERY MUCH THE DEFAULT A THI IS ATI IN A VERY LITTLE VARIABILITY BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PSYTES THAT HAVE DONE THIS WORK ON THESE CONDITIONS A TYMICALLY IT'S TRUE PEOPLE IDEALLY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSION WAS AT AT LEAST ONE WHOS A PSYCHARTERIST OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST OF SOME OTHER KIND OF PSYCHOTERAPIST FOR PSYCHATIC NURSE AN BUT IDEALLY TOO WHO MEET THOSE CRITERIO WITH A INDIVIDUAL WHOS INGESTED THE DRUG AND A MUSIC PLAYING THROUGHOUT A KIND OF RUNWAY INTO TAKING THE DRUG AND ENTHROUGHOUT O THIS CONTINUITY THE MUSIC WITH EURICS OR OR WITHOUTOUSLYRICS TO BEGIN WITH AND THE MUSIC TYPICALLY IS SPACIOUS TO BEGIN WITH AN AND THEN BUILDS AND BECOMES ATMOSPHERIC AH THERE MIGHT BE AD A NICOM TRIBL DRUMS IN THE DISTANCE OR OR SOMETHING AS AS IT DEVELOPS OR LIKE THE SOUND OF A BIRD IN THE DISTANCE AND I A BIRDS CALL AN AND THEN AS IT GETS INTO MORE STRONGER DRUG EFFECTS A THE MUSIC AND STARTS TO COAX A EMOTION AND VERY INTENTIONALLY ENI STRINGS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD COME IN AND A AND IT'S IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT OF ONE THAT WE LOVE TO DO ATUALLY A TO SEE WHETHER IF YOU WERE TO PULL THAT OUT WHETHER THE THE PSYCHODELIC EXPERIENCE WOULD BE AS EMOTIONALLY INTENSE AS AS IT IS IN PSYCHODELICTHERAPY WHEN YOU HAVE MUSIC THERE IS A DEFAULT AND ACROSS THE BOARD PEOPLE SHOULD FIND THIS REMARKABLE BECAUSE A KIND OF IS ALL OF THE PUBLISH STUDIES THAT AN OUT EN I HAVING SUCH AN IMPACT A ON PSYCHOLOTRY AN BEYOND HAVE MUSIC THERE IS A STAPLE COMPONENT AND WE JUST TAKE IT AS ASSUMPTION THAT IT NEEDS TO BE I TEND TO SHARE THAT ASSUMPTION BUT IT'S REMARKABLE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED PROPERLY BUT IT'S THAT YOU N IF YOU WERE TO RUN WITH THAT AND AND IF YOU WERE  YOU KN I HAD A KIND OF CRITICAL AGENDER YOU WOULD SAY WELL THIS IS MUSIC THERAPY YOU KNOW AND WHY U MAKING ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT PSYCHODELICS A IT'S MUSIC THAT'S THERE IN ALL THESE TRIALS WITH ALL THESE FANTASTIC FINDINGS I THERE IS SOMETHING TO THAT YOU KNOW AND THIS WILL TEAK ME UP PROBABLY TO TALK ABOUT PSYCHODELIC THERAPY BEING A COMBINATION TREATMENT A WE HAVE THE HITIN BETWEEN THE TWO BICOUS I ASHAN THE HYPOTHESIS ATHE ASUMPTION THAT SHOULD BE TESTED META T THERE IS A POSITIVE INSURRACTION BETWEEN THE TWO ECESSINITY BETWEEN THE TWO A THAT'S WHY ITS PSYCHODELIC THERAPY YEIVAN JUST LIKE CART HART HER I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BRAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE ISN' I STARTY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOD IS VERY IMPORTANT AS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIATICS ENATHLETIC GRENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE CRIP IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU 'RE ON THE ROAD AND THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S ATHLETIC GREEN STOCCALM SLASHHUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY A VITEMEND THREE K TO THIS IS EXTREMELY USEFUL TO HEAR BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK OK PSYCHODELIC WHETHER NOT TEY HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH PSYCHODELICS OR NOT ITS A VISUAL HALLUCINATION IN SOME ODITORY HALLUCINATIONS AND CYNESISIA SOME VISUAL AUDITORY BLENDING AM SOME AT A SENSATION YOU KNOW RUBBING A SURFACE AND AND BEING ABLE TO ELICIT THE A SOUNDS IN ONE'S MIND AM OF COURSE IT CETERA BUT SO SELDOM DO WE ACTUALLY HEAR ABOUT THE THE SPECIFICS OF THESE CLINICAL TRIALS IN A WAY THAT FOR INSTANCE POINTS TO MUSIC ATS ONE OF THE PERHAPS KEY VARIABLES NOW YOU MENTION THAT AS PEOPLE ENTER THESE PSYCHODELIC STATES THAT THERE IS A LITLE BIT OF INITIAL ANXIETY M  OUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR MATTHEW JOHNSON WHO'S RUNNING SOME SOLICIPE AN TRIALS AT JOHN'S HOPKINS AS YOU KNOW AND HE UM MENTION THAT THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AT LEAST IN HIS MIND TO THIS IDEA OF THE PATIENT QOTINC LETTING GO OR ALLOWING THE EXPERIENCE TO TAKE THEM SOMEPLACE MENTALLY AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO CONSTRAIN THEIR CENSORY AND COGNITIVE EXPERIENCE AIOBCURES WHAT YOUR REFLECTIONS ARE ON THAT ON THAT IDEA AND WHY IT MIGHT BE SO VALUABLE CLINICALLY UM AND THIS TIES BACK TO THIS EARLIER TIDISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING ABOUT THE UNCONSCIOUS OR ABOUT PSYCHODELICS REVEALING SOMETHING THAT'S THERE ALL THE TIME BUT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO UM YOU KNOW IT'S AND AGAIN I'M I'M STRUGGLING TO FIND THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR THIS BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A NURAL MECHANISM LIKE YOU DON'T TOP DOWN IN HABITION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS YOU KNOW UNCONSCIOUS MIGHT BE UNCORKED IN THE PSYCHODOLIC EXPERIENCE BUT TO MAKE IT QUITE SIMPLE AND DIRECT HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT REALLY IS FOR THE PATIENT TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE QUOTIN LETTING GO AND WHAT IN THE WORLD IS LETTING GO IN BIOLOGICAL TERMS YE E I THINK WE'LL GET THERE IN TIMES OF HAVING BEEN YOUR CARNETES OF  THE MIND REVEALING ITSELF TO ITSELF YAN  THE I MUSCIENCE OF UNCONSCIOUTHE UNCONSCIOUS INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OR UNCONSCIOUS MATERIAL INTO CONSCIOUS OF LENESS IT'S A IT'S A WONDERFUL CHALLENGE IT'S HUGE H CHALLENGE BUT IT'S THE CHALLENGE TO EMBRACE AND AND LETTING GO VERY MUCHIS AGAIN A STAPLE COMPONENT OF HAV THE DIFFERENT TEAMS DO THIS WORK IN TERMS OF ENCOURAGING A WILLINGNESS TO LET GO AND WHEN WE STARTED OUT DOING OUR DEPRESSION WORK AND AND DID THAT FIRST TRIAL IS THE FIRST TRIAL OF A VEPSYCHADELIC IN A FORMERLY DAGNOS DEPRESSION IN A WER THAT WAS THE TARGIT POPULATION AND DEPRESSED POPULATION'S THE FIRST MODERN STUDY TO DO THAT AND AND WE VISITED HOPKINS OUR FRIENDS THERE AND AND WERE AND MENTOR ON HOW TO DO THE GUIDING BILL RICHED MERY COSSIMANA THEY WERE JUST SO AND BRILLIANT AND AND IN A WISIN IN THERE AND IN THEIR GUIDANCE TO US AS TO HOW TO DO THE GUIDING IN OUR TRIAL AND SO THIS PHRASE OF TRUS TO LET GO BE OPEN YOU'RE HERE A LOT I DON'T KNOW WHO FAIRLY SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO BUT I WOULD ATTRIBUTED TO BILL A BILL RICHARDS MAY YOUR EVERYTHING'S BORROWE YOU PROBLY GOT IT FROM SOMEWHAT ONE ELSE BUT ITS SUCH A KEE PRINCIPLE IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MANTRER THAT YOURE TRYING TO INSTILL IN PEOPLE TRUST LET GO BE OPEN AND THOSE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WHERE THE TRUST IS ABOUT THE THE REPUTED REPORT THAT AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS GOES BEYOND JUST IN TUITION NOW WE FORMERLY MEASURED THE REPUTED REPORT WE BUT DO IT EVEN WETE JUST A SINGLE ITER ME A VISUAL ANALOGUES SCO ITON THE SUBJECTOV RATINGSCALE ITEN ON THE MORNING OF DOSING AND WE FIND THAT IT SIR IT'S A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF THE QUALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE UNDER THE TRUNG IN IN THE PSYCHADELICTHERAPE AND THEN THE THERAPUTED OUTCOMES EX WEEKS OR MONTHS LATER AN SO VERY POWERFUL KIND OF CHAIN OF A SOR PREDICTIVE COMPONENTS THERE THE TRUST ESSENTIALLY IMPORTANT AND AGAIN NOT JUST TH INTUITION BUT THE DATES APPOINTING TO THAT LET GO AT THERE'S A READINESS A READINESS TO SURRENDER TO LET GO TO NOT RESIST AN WE DO MEASURE THAT TO AND SEE THAT IT'S PREDICTIVE O RESPONSE AN AND THEN THE BEING OPEN IS ABOUT A AN A WILLINGNESS TO GO THERE TO CONFRONT TO BE INQUISITIVE AH SOMETHING THAT'S EASIER PSED THAN DONE CAN BE TERRIFYING AND I WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH A VERY VUNERABLE POPULATION AH IT'S PROBABLY MORE THE RULE THAN THE EXCEPTION A THEIR CARRYING SOME SIGNIFICANT ADVERSITY LIFE ADVERSITY OR FRANK TRORMER THAT THEY'VE SUFFERED AND SO THAT MESSAGE OF BE OPEN BE WILLING TO CONFRONT AND TO GO THERE IS REALLY AN I IT'S REALLY POWERFUL AN AND THAT THAT'S HOW IT PLAYS OUT AN AND OFTEN THERE IS STRUGGLE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THAT IS I DON'T WANT TO BE FEELING THIS MAKE IT STOP THAT CAN BE NIGHT MERISH AT TIMES WITH IT'S VERY VERY STRONG AND WITH THESE BIGDOSES THAT WE GIVE IT'S SA IT'S VERY STRONG AND A ATUALLY A A STUDENT AN THAT I'VE WORKED WITH AN I THINK NOW DOING A PGT ARRY BROWER I'S WORKING ON A FANTASTIC PROJECT CHARACTERIZING THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE PSYCHODELIC EXPERIENCE WITH THE EARLY FACE IS DOMINATED BY N NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND A NEGATIVE AE NEGATIVE THE VEILANCE FEELINGS OF ANXIETY AND STRUGGLE AND THAN IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY AND THE LATER A COULD ASK ABOUT THAT  FOR SO I THINK THAT'S FASCINATING AND IMPORTANT TO ANALYZE THE DIVERENT PHASES AND AGAIN I'M DELIGHTED HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE TYPICALLY HERE ABOUT A PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY BUT WE NEVER REALLY HEAR ABOUT THE THE KIND OF STERATYPIC COMPONENTS OF THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF THAT JOURNEY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A PEAKUE AND THAT THERE'S A KIND OF A PARI SHOOTING DOWN AND AN ET CATERA BUT A WHEN YOU SAY THAT TYPICALLY THERE'S AN ANXIETY MAY BE SOME NEGATIVE EILANCE IN THE EARLY STAGE DO YOU MEAN ABOUT THE SENSATIONS PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING OR ABOUT SOME PRIOR EVENT THAT'S BEING CALLED TO MIND THAT THEYRE REMEMBERING M LIKEWISE FOR THE POSITIVE PHASE OF THE PSYCHODELIC A JOURNEY OR TRIP ARE PEOPLE THEY STILL CALLED A TRIP YE ARE FOR THE A IKE A WILL YOU'SE TRIP FOR THE PSYCHODELI TRIP ARE PEOPLE FEELING POSITIVE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE LIKE AH LIKE THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF BREAK THROUGH OR THERE IN A IN A CALMER STATE OR IS IT THAT THEY TEND TO BE FOCUSSING ON PRIOR EVENTS THAT WERE POSITIVE SO IN OTHER WORDS IS THERE A THREADING THROUGH OF SOME A CONCEPT THAT COMES TO MIND FOR PEOPLE MAYBE ABOUT AN EARLIER TRAMAOR MAY BE ABOUT A SENSE OF SELL FOR A SENSE OF OTHER FORGIVENESS A YOU DON'T COUL BE ANY THESE THINGS BUT WHATD' WE KNOW ABOUT THE CONFINER DETAILS OF ALL THATAN O SAY THE INITIAL AM STRUGGLE IS MORE AGAINST A GENERAL DRUG EFFECTS THAN PINNING IT ON ON SOMETHING SPECIFIC IT'S MORE THAT IN A NOMAL WAKIN CONSCIOUSNESS WE HAVE A SENSE GEERALLY SPEAKING IF WER WELL OR WELL ENOUGH A SENSE OF ASSUREDNESS ABOUT WHAT'S WAT AN AS TI WERAND AND  AND I AND AN WE HAVE THAT SSUREDNESS IN TO AN EXTENT ABOUT OURSELVES AS WELL IT MIGHT BE LLUSORY BUT E HAVE IT AND WHAT THE DRUG'S DOING IS IT'S BREAKING DOWNALL OF THAT AND IT'S SCARIOUS HEL AND I AND IF IT'S A BIG DICE IT'S JUST LIKE HUMAN NATURE TO BI TO RET IN I RACE AGAINST THAT OF BEN AND A BET LIKE DYING YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT THIS IT FEELS LIKE I COULD BE DYING YAM I MIGHT LOSE MY MIND YET THAT I EVER COME ON A TO I THE CLASSICS IS  BUT I MIGHT YOU KNOW I MIGHT KNOW THAT I'VE TAKEN A PSYCHODELIC AND I MIGHT EVEN KNOW A BIT ABOUT PSYCHODELICS BUT I STILL FEAR THAT I'M GOING TO GO MAD AN AL THAT I KNOW THAY YOU KNOW GENERALLY SPEAKING THESE DRUGS THA HAVE A HI AN AN I FOR FATILITY AN AA RISK AH I STILL THINK I GANG TO DIE AND I AN AND IT'S JUST IT'S VERY PALPABLE IN THAT AND THAT COMES P SAY YEH THAT'S THAT I MEAN TOSE OF THE COURF IS TATTA DIS TOO AND VERY RELAVY THAT COMES UP AND IT'S REALLY LIKE A BASIC DRUG ACTION IT'S DICE DEPENDENT THAT IT'S A BASIC DRU ACTION THAT IS FORCING SOMETHING ABOUT THE NATURE F THE MIND AND THE WAY IT'S MADE UP THAT MAKES IT FEEL THAT WAY O BUT IT FEELS LIKE I'M LOSING MY MIND OR IT FEELS LIKE A COULD LOSE MY MIND OR THA I COULD GO IN SAYING OR THAT MAYBE IM I'M DYING HERE AND THIS IS BD YE A YOU'VE TALKED MANY TIMES BEFORE AND HAVE DONE REALLY WONDERFUL WORK LOOKING AT THE CHANGES IN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS WHILE UNDER WHILE PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHODELICS I THINK THE GISTALT OF THOSE DAT ARE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS THAT I'M COMPARED TO THE NON PSYCHODELIC STATE THAT UNDER PSYCHODELIC INFLUENCE AM THERE IS FAR MORE US JUST CALL IT INTERCONACTIVITY OR A COMMUNICATION IM BETWEEN A BRAIN AREAS THE TYPICALLY AREN'T COMMUNICATING WHICH PROBALY I S NOT SURPRISING TO PEOPLE GIVEN THE THE UNSUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF THESE OF THESE DRUGS WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT AFTER THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY IS OVER THAT SOME OR PERHAPS ALL OF THAT INHINCED COMMUNICATION ACROSS BRAIN AREAS IS MAINTAINED AND IF SO WHAT ROLE DO YOU FEEL THAT COULD PLAY IN THESE INCREDIBLE POSITIVE THERAPEUTIC OUT COMES YER SO WE WE'VE HAD A SOME RECENT FINDINGS IN IN THAT DIRECTION WHERE YES IT'S TRUE AND YET IT THE A PICTURE THE SAYS A THOUSAND WORDS OF SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH THESE TWO CIRCLES AN THE PROJECT THAT WE DID IN CLABERATION WITH SOME RESEARCHES WERE ORDINARILY THE COMMUNICATION IS GOING ON AND WITHIN SYSTEMS LIKE OTHER REGIONS OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM WILL BE SPEAKING MOSTLY WITHIN THE VISUAL SYSTEM TAT BE A CINDICCLEQIST CLEAKISHNESS OR A MODULARITY TO THE QUALITY OF THE COMMUNICATION IN THE BRAIN AND THEN THE COOL FINDING WITH SOLICIBIN WAS THE FIRST OF PAPER IS THAT THE COMMUNICATION YES HE SORT OF TRANSCENDS THESE MODULES AND BECOMES MUCH MORE INTO MODULAR AN CROSSING DIFFERENT A MIDALITIES AND THAT FAIR CORRELATED WITH TH MAGNITY THAT THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS AND THAT WE REPLICATED IT WITH ELESTESIN DIFFERENT METHODS AND A NEW PAPERL COME OUT SOON WITH DEENTE SHOWING A SIMILAR EFFECT THE BIT OF DEBATE ABOUT WHAT REGIONS OF MOST IMPLICATED BUT THE GENERAL EFFECT OF AN INCREASING GLOBLE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IS WHAT WE CALL IT WIL GLOBLE COMMUNICATION IN THE BRAIN AND THIS IS WELL UNDER THE INFLUENCE IS THES UNREVIES OF PREPEOPLE INTO A BRAIN SCANRER WHILE THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DRUG YEA YET AT ITSELF MUST BE A QUITE AN EXPERIENCE GIVEN THAT THESE SCANNERS ARE SMAL R TUBES YOU'RE IN A BITE BAR YEF U GT AP BITE BARR IN YOUR MOUTH THAT'S A A LL GET QUITE A AT U STADY YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE A BITE FATHER AT LEAS WITH THE PSYCHODELICS BUT YER YOU GO TO KEEP YOU HAD STILL AND AND YAFTE LOUD I AM A SCANINOIS GOING BUT BECAUSE IT'S REGULAR AM THERE AREN'T TOU MANY SURPRISES SI IT'S ATY SURPRISINGLY TOLERABLE INERE IN A HOSPITAL SETTING SO YOU NOT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU HAD A CARTY AC OF EN EIN A PROFESSION HAS AROUND AND YOUN'T MOST PEOPLE GENERALLY TOLERATE THAT SETTING QUITE WELL SURPRISINGE WELL BUT YEARE WE DO ALL THAT AND AND YES WE DO SEE THAT AM OPENING UP OF THE COMMUNICATION ACROSS SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND IT DOES SPEAK TO KIND OF INTUITION ABOUT THE SUBJECT OF EXPERIENCE THE IN I DIFFERENT MIDALITIES MIGHT BE BLENDING WITH EACH OTHER IS IT SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING BUT I HAVE TO ASK IS IT THOUGHT THAT THE ACTIVATION OF THE SURETONE INTO A RECEPTOR IS WHAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BRAIN AIR IS THAT UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NOT BE COMMUNICATE YES SO THE'S A FEW REASONS WHY SO MODELLING WORK THE COMPUTATION MODELING WORK THE FIRST IDENTIFIES WHERE THE TWO A RECEPTOR IS AND THEN LOOKS AT AND MODELS ITS BASIC EFFECTS ON YOURL ACTIVITY AM WELL RECAPITULATE THE THE OR AM RECREATE THE EFFECT THAT WE SEE ACTUALLY IN THE DATA WITH THE SCANNING I DOING THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING YOU CAN SEE THE SAME EFFECT BY KNOWING A WHETHER TO IT WHETHER THE KEE RECEPTORS ARE AND THEN MAKING THEM DO A CERTAIN THING THAT WE NOW PSYCHIDOLICSTY I CAN IMAGINE TWO POSSIBILITIES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THESE TWO ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT THE ACTIVATION OF THIS SERATON IN TO A RECEPTORATELEAST INCREASE CONACTIVITY END HEREBY AUDITORY INVISUAL HALLUCINATIONS EMERGE CHANGED PATTERNS OF THINKING EMERGE ET CETERA THAT SORT OF THE OBVIOUS INTERPRETATION BUT AM THE SCIENTIST IN ME HAS TO ASK IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF THAT INCREASED CONACTIVITY IS OCCURRING AND YET THAT IS A DISTINCT PHENOMENON LAYERED ON TOP OF SOME OTHER EFFECT OF THE PSYCHODELIC DRUGS IMPACTING ACCESS TO THE TO THE UNCONSCIOUS HALLUCINATIONS IN OTHER WORDS IS IT THE INCREASED CONNECTIVITY THAT'S LEADING TO THE SUBJECT OF EXPERIENCE OR OF THOSE TWO THINGS HAPPENING AND PARALLEL WILL THEY HAPPEN IN PARALLEL AND THE MAP TO EACH OTHER THE QUESTION OF CAUSALITY WHAT CAUSES WAT A IS THE TRICKY THING WHERE I I WOULD SUGGESTED THE SE THE THE CAUSALITY IS CIRCULAR THAT I INFLUENCE EACH OTHER AND THAT THIS GETS A BIT PHILOSOPHICAL BUT A KIND OF MATTERS BECAUSE OTHERWISE IN A THA'S A TRAP THE IT'S EASY TO FALL INTO A WERE YOU'RE THINKING THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BRAIN ACTION CAUSING THE SUBJECTS OF EXPERIENCE AND THATS TYPICALLY WHAT WE DOING COLCLATIVE MERE ASSCIENCE AM IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE TOT OF FIRST PORT OF COL KIND OF MATERIALIST TE APPROACH WHO WON'T COMBE A MATERIALIST ESSENTIALLY BUT STILL APPRECIATE THAT CIRCULAR CAUSALITY THE MIND ALSO INTERRACTS WITH BRAIN AM AND IT SO A TO PICK THE TO APART AND THERE IS A KIND OF ESSENTIUAL DUALISM WHERE SUBJECTS OF EXPERIENCE IS THE THING IN ANOF ITSELF BUT THAT'S NOT TO DIVORSEIVE FROM WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE BY MUCH OCLEVEL THE THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE AM AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOWADAYS THEREIS A BIT OF A MOVEMENT WITHIN THE  SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THAT STUDY PSYCHODELICS TO DEVELOP DRUGS THAT CAN ESSENTIALLY CURE OR ALLEVIATE MANY OF THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION OR TRAMA THAT ARE BUILT OFF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PSYCHODELICS LIKE SYLICIBE IN AND HERE I'LL THROW EMPDY AMA IN THERE ALTHOUGH CLASSICALLY NOTAPSYCHODELICATES CONNIGETS LUMPED IN WEND GET BACK TO THAT LATER BUT THAT DO NOT PRODUCE HALLUCINATIONS OR MASSIVE CHANGES AN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE I SHOALD THINK THIS IS WHAT INITIALLY GOT US INTO CONVERSATION ON TWITTERS I S HAD LEARNED ABOUT THIS PAPER PUBLISHED OUT OF A GROUP AT YOU SEE DAVIS THAT ESSENTIALLY MODIFYING PSYCHODELICS SO THAT THEY HAVE POTENTIAL THERPEUTIC APPLICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION BUT ZERO HALLUCINATE GENIC PROPERTIES AND I THOUGHT WHILE THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY CONTROVERSIAL THING IN THE WORLD RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE HISTORY OF PSYCHODELICSAS YOU POINTED OUT HAS BEEN ONE OF PEOPLE ACCESSING DIFFERENT MODES OF THINKING FEELING SEEING THINGS THESE INLETTING GO TRUST ET CETERA A THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP AND HERE WE HAVE UM I DON'T WANT TO SAY FARM ECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY FARMA BUT WE HAVE LABORATORIES WO ARE TRYING TO UM TE'S APART THE ACTIVATION OF RECEPTORS INDEPENDENT OF ALL THAT SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO ESSENTIALLY TREAT THE SAME CONDITIONS AN LE YOU TO COMMENT ON THIS WHERE YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE GOING UM AND YOU KNONT WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THAT'S THE WRIT OR THE WRONG APPROACH IF IT HAS ANY VALIDITY AT ALL IT IS FARMERS TO SMON OFAMA OT IS TOTS U FAMA BE POKIS BECAUSE FARMA WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DRUGS THAT CAN CURE DEPPRESSION BUT DON'T MAKE PEOPLE HALLUCINATE IS THAT A THEY WOULD AND PATIENCE MINE AND THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS USED TO ITIT'S MEDICINE RIGHT AND IT DOESN'T GIVE THIS THIS UM A MENTAL IMAGERY OF A YOU KNOW THE SUMMER OF LOVE IN SAN FRANCISCO OR OF V YOU DON' CALLIDOSCOPEIYES RIGHT ONCE MORE E YOU CAN IMAGINE THE UM MORE TO BE CAREFUL WITH MY WORDING HERE UM THOSE WHO WOULD NOT BE INCLINE TOWARD THAT WOULD MIGHT MIGHT EMBRACE AT THER P U I CATHAT THAT IS STRICTLY EFFECTIVE AT TREATING DEPRESSION WITH NO HALLUCINATIONS YAT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT IN A AN INDIVIDUAL LYING ON A SYPHER CRYING THERE OUR EYES OUT A AM ABOUT IN A THE LIFE THAT THEY'VE LIVED AM AND THAT DEEP CATHASIS BEING LIFE TRANSFORMING THE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT MODEL AN I'M SCEPTICAL OF IT AND MI FOR A FEW REASONS AND AND ONE IS THAT I I CAN'T SEE THE LOGIC AM I CAN'T SEE THE PIECES FIT IN A WAY THAT'S COMPELLING AND I'M ALSO SCEPTICAL CAS I THINK IT COULD EASILY BE WISHFOR THINKING BECAUSE OF THAT POINT THAT PATIENCE WOULD LIKE IT AND THE SYSTEM WOULD LIKE IT AND I JUST THE CAN'T YOU GOT IT THERE THAT IN MIND AS WELL AM SO WOULDN'T IT BE CONVENIENT IN A IF IT WERE TRUE AND YOU COULD GET THE THEREPETIC ACTION WITHOUT THE PSYCHODELIC EFFECT ON A WAY THAT'S A TTLE BIT OF WHAT MICRODOE SEEMS SEEMS TO BE DESIGN YE YOU LIKE YOU SAIT TAKE DOSAGES THERE BELOW THAT THAT A PERCEPTIBLE ORSU YOU KNOW AWARENESS OF SOME EFFECT THRESHOLD OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME IN AN ATTEMPT TO PING THE CIRCUITS OR TWI YOUD AT YOU ALTER THE CIRCITS BUT NAT POLLUCINATE YET NOT HAVE A CATHERSUS SO IF IF MYCRODISING COUL DO THAT AND IT'S SUB PERCEPTIBLE THE MYCHRODISING ISN'T PSYCHODELIC ACTION BECAUSE WHERES THE PSYCHODELIC ACTION WHEN PSYCHODELIC WHEN DEFINED MEAN PSYCHE REVEALING YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT EFFECT YOU MIGHT BE GETTING THE FARMACOLOGY MIGHT BE GETTING SOME DIRECT PSARATINE INTO A RECEPTIR AGONISM THAT COULD BE DRIVING A THEREPETIC RESPONSE BUT YOU CAN GET THAT WITH ACCESS RISE AS WELL AN I AND SO MY POINT IS WHAT'S WHAT'S NEW OCA MAY BE IT SUMIT KNEW IN PEOPLE ARE NOW DEVELOPING DIRECT TO AY AGONISTS RATHER AN INDIRECT THROUGH A CERETONA RELEASER LIKE THE SELECTIVE SERETONE REOTACIN IBITORS THE ESCESSORISE LIKE LIKE SERPRIIAN ARE THERE ANY ESSESSORISE THAT SELECTIVELY AGONIZE AN WHICH FOLKS BY THE WAY MEANS ACTIVAT IN A GOOD WAY GAGONY SANDS TERRIBLE TO THOSE MEN AN FORN MIGHT THING THAT MEAN THA DISRUPT BUT THEY CAN ACTIVAT THE CERETONINTO A RECEPTOR ARE THER ANY DRUGS THAT WILL DO THAT THAT ARE NOT PSYCHODEIC I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYBUT THEN AGAIN IAM NON O THERRE AH THERE ARE ME THAT THERE ANY THATA A LICENSETON USED AS MEDICINSE IN PSYCHOLETRY AS HE HAD THIS DEBAY AN RECENTLY ON SOCIAL MEDIAR AND I COULDN'T SEE I COULDN'T SEE A COMPELLING EXAMPLE I SAW TWO AAGONIST THAT WE USE FOR OTHER THINGS YEVE A COMPAUND LIKE LISERIDE USED IN ENTREATING PARKINSON'S BUT ATCIITS MORE OF A DOPENIN AGONISTS I AND THERE ALWAYS HAING OTHER THING THEYRE IHT YER YES IT TAPPING OTHER INE LET BE O TRAS ROTEF THINGS SO IS THERE IS HERE A SELECTIVE CERETONY TO A RECEPTOR STIMULATOR AN AGONIST AND THAT IT ISN'T PSYCHODELIC THAT IS THEREPUTO ENPSYCHALTRY IN THE ANSWER FIRMLY AS NOT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET WILL THEY DEVELOP ONE WELL FOR PATIENT'S SAKE I HOPE SO BECAUSE IT WOULD BE GREAT AN LET'S WAIT AND SEE IF THEY DO I DOUBT IT WILL BE PSYCHODELIC AND I DOUBT IT WOULD HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH PSYCHODELIC THERAPY AN AND IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE LIKE THE SYSTEM RELUASED TO OF CHRONIC FARMO CHOTHERAPY TAKE YOUR DRUG EVERY DAY LET'S LET'S HOPE THEY FIND IT AN IT WORKS FOR PATIENT'S SAKE BUT AS THINGS SDANRIGHT NOW IAM A LITTLE SCEPTICAL LET SOME OF THE FINDINGSTEAD OF BEING SEEN THAT A REALLY EXCITING F ANTASTIC WORK BEING DONE SHOWING THINGS LIKE INCREASES N THE COMMUNICATION COMPINENCS OF NURONS DENDRITIC GRCE A SPINE GRICE A SYNAPTIC PINE GRICE YET BY THE WAY FOLKS YUSTE ALL INTERRUPT FOR A NATANESSARILY SPINA THE BONE INNER THA NOT THE CEREBRAL A A CAUM BUT AM SPINES ARE THESE LITTLE LIKE LITTLE TINY TWIGS WITH BULBS ON THE END OF OF NURONS THAT ARE ALLOW FOR COMMUNICATION POINTS BETWEEN NURONS SONERO PLASTOSY IS OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH GROWTH OF DENDRITES AND SPINES AND SO WORTH WHICH IS WHAT WHATROBINS REFERRING TO THAT THAT REMINDS ME AN I JUST ONE O MAKE SURE THAT I WE CLOSE THE HATCH ON THE EARLIER ANSWER BECAUSE I INTTERRUPTED YOU IS THE INCREASED CONACTIVITY BETWEEN OR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BRAIN AREAS THAT'S OBSERVED WHILE PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE PSYCHADELIC ALSO OBSERVED LATER AFTER THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG WEAREOFF AND THEN I'LL JUST THROWING ANOTHER QUESTION THERE BECAUSE WE'RE ON TO THIS TOPIC NOW TO WHAT EXTENT DO WE THINK THAT NUROW PLASTICITY STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN NURONS FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN NURANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND HOW LONG DOES THAT LAST LET SAY I TAKE LES I COME INTO YOUR CLENIC AM AMA AMIN SUBJECT IN YOUR EXPEREMENT I TAKE DO COME IN IN THE MORNING I DO MY PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY FIVE OR SIX HOURS LATER AN PAR SHOOTING BACK TO REALITY AS WE CALL IT AND THEN I GO HOME INCREASE CONACTIVITY LASTS FOR HOW LONG AND HOW LONG ARE THE STRUCTURAL BRAIN CHANGES AN RURING WALL YOURE ASKIN FANTASTIC QUESTIONS AND A PARTLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER YET BUT WE DO HAVE SOME WE DO HAVE SOME DATE AND SO WE HAVE LOOKED TO FUS WIL THE IN A SENSE THE FUNCTION PLASTICITY OR WHAT WE ASSUME IT TO BE OR AT LEAST THE FUNCTION  CHANGES THE INCREASING COMMUNICATION ACROSS SYSTEMS AM THAT INCREASING GROIABLE CONACTIVITY FUNCTION CONACTIVITY DO WE SEE IT AFTER THE TRIC WE KNOW WE SEEIT DURING THE TRIP PRETTY WELL REPLICATED CORRELATESING WITH INTENSE STRUNG EFFECTS DO WE SEE IT AFTER THE TRIP THE ANSWER IS WE'VE SEEN IT IN TO DIFFERENT DEPRESSION COHORT SOLICIDE INTERIPY FOR DEPRESSION IN ON'T STUDY WHERE WE LOOK THE NEXT DAY WE SAW IT KIND OF RESITULE AM A AFFECT SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SEE ACUTELY BEING SEEN THE NEXT DAY AND THEN IN A SUBSEQUENT STUDY WE SAW IT ALSO THREE WEEKS LATER SO WE'VE SEEN IT TO INDEPENDENT AY TO SETS THIS DECREASE IMMORDULARITY IS HOW WE MEASURE IT THE SAME THING ESSENTIALLY BROADLY SPEAKING ITS THE SAME THI AN INCREASING GLOBE CONNECTIVITY FUNCTUAL CONNETIVITY AND I SHE UNPUBLISHED WE'VE SEEN IT IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS ON A CORRELATION REVEL NOT ON AN ABSOLUTE CHANGE LEVEL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT'S RELATIONSHIP TO A MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO STRESS WITH HE DEPRESSION WORK WE SAW A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT CHANGE THE DECREASIN MODULARITY OR INCREASIN GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOM SEVERITY SO INTERESTING YE OY WHAT I AND JUST A STATE A A DIFFERENT WAY SO AM WHAT ROBINS REFERRING TO HIS WECS I RO MODULARITY IS NUR SCIENTISTS WE THINK OF THE THE DIFFERENT MODULAR NETWORKS OF THE BRAIN THAT EU OF THE EYE TALKS TO A REGION OF THE FOULNESS IN VOLVED IN VISION WHICH OCKS TO THE VICUAL COURTTACS WHICH YOU EVENTUALLY CONVERGES WITH AUDITORY INFORMATION OF COURSE AM BUT THERE'S A SEPARATION OR MODULARITY OF FUNCTION THIS INCREASED CONNECTIVITY IS CROSS MORDULER INDURING THE TRIP BUT AFTERWARDS AS WELL AN YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT CORRELATES VERY STRONGLY WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE THER APUDIC OUTCOME TOF DEPRESSION AMAN THE THE LODICAL EXTENSION OF THAT IS THAT EXTREME MODULARITY OF BRAIN FUNCTION IS UNDEPRESSIVE IN SOME WAY N OW WE DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT INCREASING CROSS TALK AM BETWEEN DIFFERENT MODULES OF THE BRAIN IS SO STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH A POSITIVE THERAPEUTIC OUTCOME WE DON'T KNOW OTHER THAN AS A RELATIONSHIP I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS THE THING WE NEEDS BE LITTLE CAREFUL NOT TO RUN WITH IT TOO FAR I MEAN THATS SOME THINGS THAT IT SUGGESTS I THINK IT SUGGESTS A MORE FLEXIBLE A MODE OF BRAIN FUNCTIONING IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING STOCKIN MODULES OR THE MODULES ON AM EXCESSIVELY CUT OFF FROM EACH OTHER BUT YOU SEE DIFFERENT THINGS WITH WITH DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS IF YOU AR TO LOOK AT CUGNITION SHOP A CULGNITION IS THAT SHE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE MOGULARITY SO T IT'S A RULE IT'S A LITTLE SLIPPERY AND WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH IT IJUST A AGEIN O A FORGIVE ME FOR INTERNBUT I THINK I'VE FRIENDS WHO ARE AM I WOULD SAY ARE ON THE SPECTRUM WHO ARE AM VERY LINEAR IN THEIR THINKING IN EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT IN A IN THE CONCLASSIC SENSE OF BEING ABLE TO RATCH IT THROUGH HARD PROBLEMS TO ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION AND THEN IAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE US JUST CALLMAT THEY ARE FROM THE CREATIVE COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE OF SCIENCE THAT AM ARE VERY EXPANSIVE AM THEY SEE CUT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BUT YOU SOMETIMES YOU HAVE NOT ALL OF THEM WE HAVE TO CATCH THEIR IDEAS WITH A BUTTERFLYING AT AND OFTENTIMES WHAT THEY'RE SAYING DOESN'T SOMETIMES JUST AS IT MAKE ANY SENSE NOW THEY ALSO PRODUCE INCREDIBLE CREATIVE WORKS BUT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM IS ANYTHING BUT A LINEOR EXPERIENCE THEY ARE NOT RANDOM THOUGHT GENERATORS AM BUT THERE'S A NON LINEARITY OR RANDOM ASS TO THEIR PROCESSING THAT'S DISTINCT FROM THESE OTHER FOLKS THAT I'M DESCRIBING AS ON THE SPECTRAMEN OF COURSE IT'S A SPECTRUM THERE'S SO A WHOLE RANGEING BETWEEN AM SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERE'S SOME THERAPEUTIC VALUE OU TO BEING ABLE TO MOVE ALONG THIS CONTINUUM FROM THE MORE LINEAR TO THE NON LINEAR IS THAT IS THAT  I THINK ATE I YE YOUR IT'S RESINATING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT SPEAKING TO MY INTUITION THE YOU NI A YOU COULD BE VERY PASSY YOU KNOW PASSING THINGS AR CHOPING THINGS U LIKE AN ANALYTICAL SCIENCE IS LY LI KIND ES BETTER AS WE SAY IN PSIDE YOUR EITHER A LUMBER IR A SPLUTTER YE BUT YOU KNOW THE WAY IN BEING VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT WHAT WAT WHEN TO CAUL SOMETHING PSYCHADELIC YOU NI THAT THAT KIND OF PARCY ANALYTICAL WAY THINKING YOU WITH YOU MIGHT ASSOCIATE WITH A MOR MODULASSYSTEM YOU NIG AM WHERE AS THE SYSTEM AT'S MOR GLABLY INTO CONNECTED AND OPEN YE MIGHT BE MORE FLEXIBLE AND CREATIVE AND DIVERGENT IN THE ASSOCIATIONS AND SO ON SAY YES THAT'S SPEAKING TO MY INTUITION TO HOW YE YOU'R DESCRIBING IT AND I IMAGINE IF YOU TAKE SEVERE PSYCHA PYTHOLOGY SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS LIKE A DEPRESSION I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THATHERE'S SOMETHING INTUITIVE ABOUT THE TIME ITSELF LIKE A DEPRESSION IN A LANDSCAPE YOU KNOW WIC IS THAT HOMSICAL DEPRESSION PHYSICAL DEPRESSION THAT IT'S EASY TO FALL INTO AND IF YOU DO ITS HART TO GET OUT OF ITSO ALMOST AM IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOURE SAYING CORRECTLY ALMOST LIKE GETTING A'M STOCK AT ONE LOCATION ON THIS CONTINUUL BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T RESIDE AT ONE OR EXTREME ONE EXTREMER THE OTHER AT FULL TIME TIN CIN O MIGRATE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN EXPENSIVE SATE SAID MOR LINEAR STATS LIKE LIKE YOU DO I LOW MOOD YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE HEALTY AND INVERTICOMESY CAN FILLYOU LIKE ME TO DISAPPOINTMENT BUT YOU CAN SPRING BACK BUT SOMEONE WILLING KNOW YOU CAN SPRING MEYEIHT RAS THE SUICIDE OR DEPRESSIVE PERSON OR TOO ECIDEDLY DEPRESSED PERSON AM SOMEHOW AT LEAST T MY UNDERSTANDING THERE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEEXTREME DEPRESSIVE STATES AND EXTREME ANXIETY STATES SOMETHING MY LABORATORIES A BIT MORE FAMILIAR WITH ANXIETY WHICH ALTERS THE PERCEPTION OF TIME SUCH THAT PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THAT NEGATIVE THAT STATE IS GOING TO GO ON FOREVER OR THAT IF IT GOES AWAY THAT IT'S GOING TO RETURN AT RANDOM YE KIND OF A VULNERABILITY TO THE TIME DOMIN YER YETS AND IT SY TRAGIC BUT THAT THA COGRI I BIUS IN DEPRESSION THAT EVERYTHING'S HOPELESS AND AND THERE IS NO LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL YES I YEU KNOW IF YOU ARE TO GET STOCK IN THAT ROT AND HAVE THAT BIUS THEN YOUR CUT OFF FROM OTHER THINGS ARE THE CENSRY A MYDALITIES OR MOCUL SAN I CUTS OFF FROM THE WORLD CUTOF FROM OTHER PEOPLE STOCKING  IN A ROT AND A SO YES I THINK WER SHARING THIS INTUITION THAT E A ECREASE IN MUCH LARITY ARE AN OPENING UP OF THE THE SYSTEM THE BRAIN AN COULD RELATE TO AN OPENING UP OF THE MIND THAT IS KIND OF ENDURING AFTER THE AFTER THE PSYCDELIC A DICING SESSION AND YET AND AND THE THIRD REPLICATION WAS TO SEE AND HEALTHIES AN IMPROVEMENT IN WEALTH BEING BECAUSE THAT HEALTHY WE DON'T LOOK AT DEPRESSION SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE HEALTHY WALKING INTO THE TRAIL YE TAKE SILLICIDE AND TWICE A WELL AS YY THEY DO AND BUT THE FIRST ICE IS ORE MILOGRAM WHICH THEY THEY DON'T FEEL IT'S SUPPLICY BY DARONOSCOPE MICRO YH WE ARE STICKY GE ON THE HEADS AN TO MEASURE THAT BRAIN WAVS AND DURING EACH DICE AND ONE MILOGRAM YOU SEE NO CHANGE AN SO WE I THINK THAT YOU MYCRODOSERS ON JUST CANG TAT I A AGAIN A ACRODISE AS I'VE ALWAYS JUST BEEN OL BIT SCEPTICAL BASED ON MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE THE ASCIENTIST ACTHLLY DOING THE WORK WITH WITH AM WITH A PSYCODEICS IT SEEMS LIKE THE THE BANSWER KEEPS COMING BACK DO TO TO ONE OR TWO MAYBE THREE MACKRODOS IS IN A CONTROLLED SAFE SETTING WELL HAT'S COMPELLING THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS COMPELLING AND A THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING ALL THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW AND MY CRODES SEES JUST APPEALING BUT AGAIN YOU KNO SANTE ISN'T ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO BELIEVE A IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S SUTLY COMING THROUGH AND WHAT SEEMS TO HOLD UP HAN I DETESTING WOULD YOU SAY THAT'S RIGHT THE ONE OR TWO OR THREE SESSIONS AND HOW HOW FAR APART OF THOSE TYPICALLY SPACED IN TIME YTOBELY ONE TO THREE WEEKS ACROSS THE SITS IS THE WAY PEOPLE ARE DOING THE THE PSYCELICTHEROPYDICING SESSIONS TWO SESSIONS A IN A HOPKINS IMPERIO AND WHY Y AM I THAT'S A BEING A KIND OF DEFAULT TO WE YET SHE'S THREE IN A CAREN ANERECTIATRALS SON A SUDEN THERPY FRANERECTS HE A TWO PATIENTS LEFT TO TO SEE AFTER AM NINETEEN HA'VE GONE THROUGH THE TRIAL VERY EXCITING RESULTS THA ISING A ALLEVIATION OF THE THE OBSESSIVE THOUGHT ABOUT FOOD IN A WILLINGNESS TO CONSUMING EVEN HEALTHIER AMOUNTS OF YE EVEN IN IMPROVED A WAIT AT THE LONG FOLLOWA I SO CRITICAL A WEN WE DIDNT EPISODE ON EATING DISORDERS AND I LEARNED THAT A INTERECION NEROSA WHICH BY THE WAY FOLKS THE RATES OF ARE NOT INCREASING IT'S BEEN PRETTY STABLE THROUGH TIME DESPITE WHAT SAID ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA AND A ET CETERA BUT AM INERECION ROSA BEING THE MOST DEADLY OF ALL PSYCHEATRIC ILLNESSES WHICH IS A BIG STATEMENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T A MELIC DEPRESSION SO CALL BY POLER DEPRESSION AS A TWENTY TO THIRTY TIMES THE THE TYPICAL SUICYDERATE A BUSILY MANY ANERECTS IT YOUR PEOPLE WITHANERECTY I THINK IS HOW IT'S NOW AS THE IS WHAT ONE SAYS NOT A INERECTS EXPET PEOPLE WITHINERECTS HER A'M OFTEN DIE MANY OF THEM DNE YET SO TRAGIC SO OFTEN YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL AND SIMILARLY WITH SUICIDE IN TIMES OF PREMATURE DEATH SO THE TRAGEDY WITH PSYCHOLITRY IS SISTRONG AND AND TA A IT'S IT'S SO REWARDING TO BE DOING THAT TRILIN TO BE SAING IT RESULTS I HAVE TO CHECK MYSELF A LITTLE BIT THAT AN I'M AN REPORTING ON IT IN THIS VERY PERMISSERY WAY AND TAT THE TRIAL ISN'T YET PUBLICLY RELEASED AND AND PUBLISH SAY AN IT'S STILL ON GOVING AS WELL BUT THAT'S THREE TTHREE SETION INS THREE SESSIONS AND I CAN'T SAY WHAT THE DICEAGE IS BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE AN THERE IS A BLINDING COMPININ AN BUT THERE ARE THREE DISING SESSIONS AND THER TAT SEE NOW I THINK TE TWO WEEKS OF PAR AND AND WE DO THE FOLLOW A AND YES I'D LIKE TO YOR CLOSE OUT THIS A DESCRIPTION OF THE OF THE JOURNEY AND THE TRIP BY EXTENDING PAST THE DAY WHEN O PEOPLE HAVE SHLY TAKE THE DRUG INTO THIS O WHAT I'VE HER DESCRIBED AS THE INTEGRATION FACE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO REINTEGRATE RIGHT I ALL THIS LAT ALL THIS INCREASED CONACTIVITY DURING THE SESSION HALLUCINATIONS INSIGHTS ANXIETY LETTING GO MAYBE REVELATION MAY BE A PIPHANY OKA GREAT AT WHAT POINT IS THAT CONSOLIDATED MEANING AM ARE THESE PATIENTS SUBJECTS AN STUDIES HAVING DAILY CONVERSATION WITH THEIR THERAPIST ARE THE JOURNALING EVERY DAY AAND YOU KNOW I WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE PART OF A CLENICAL TRIAL AND OF COURSE HERE WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING WHAT PEOPLE DO OR NOT DO BUT WAS JUST PUT IT THIS WAY AM WERE PEOPLE TO I OU PSYCODELICS WHAT IS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN MAXIMISE ON THE NAURO PLASTICITY AND THE BRAIN CHANGES IN A POSITIVE WAY IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AFTERWARDS IN OTHER WORDS HOW LONG IES THIS SO CALLED INTEGRATIO N LAST AND YOU KNOW BUT HOW FAR CAN WE TAKE THE EMING I COULD IMAGINE THAT AM HOW OFTEN ONE CHOOSES TO THINK ABOUT THE INSIGHTS COULD ALSO HAVE AN IN PACT YE RA BECAUSE CLEARLY PEOPLE WENT TO RAVES CLEARLY PEOPLE DID PSYCHODELICS IN THE SIXTIES AND WE DON'T KNOW IF IT CLEARLY PEOPLE DO PSYCHODELICS NOW BUT WE DON'T HAVE DAT O N THOSE PEOPLE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR TIME AND THE THERAPEUTIC OUT COMES WOULD YOU  WE HAVEN'T GOT INTO THE NUMBERS YET BUT AGAIN AR AR INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE YOU KNOWING UPWARDS IF AS I UNDERSTAND AT SIXTY PER CENT OR MORE O PEOPLE GETTING A REALY FROM DEPRESSION YE SEVENTY E SEVENTY PER CENT INCREDIBLE SPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO TE TYPICAL A INTI TE PRESSENT TREATMENT A AND SO ON SO WHAT IS THIS BUSINESS OF INTEGRATION HOW IS IT DONE PROPERLY YE YE GUSH WELL HOW LONG DOES IT LAST AS WELL AN A LIFETIME AYN I LIFE IS A JOURNEY LIKE A TRIP IS A A JOURNEY AN AND AS ALWAYS WORK TO DO AN AS CHACKCOME FEEL PAYS AFTER THE ECSTASY THE LAUNDRY  YE ATT'S ATDORE BE OTHER  ONE I FORGET THEM AN TIT'S E YES IN THE WORKS ON GOING AND AND AND THER THE YE AN BUT THIS GIVES YOU A FOOTAR IT ENABLES PEOPLE TO AN TO WORK MORE EASILY AND AND THAT'S TRUE THE CASSIC PSYCHDELICS WO SAY TRUE VERY TRUE OF EM DO MAY THERUY A A PYTRAMATSIC STREST TIS ORDER IT'S REALLY GIVING YOU LEKE UP MAKING IT EASIER TO DO VERY VERY DIFFICULT WORK GOING BACK TO A TROMA TRYING TO DIGEST IT PROCESS IR INTO GRAT IT AN SO IT'S A SUCH AN EPSENTIAL COMBINENT OF THE TREATMENT MODO AN BUT ONE HAS TO BE REALISTIC AS WELL Y EN I BY SAYING OUR INSEGRATION LAST A LIFETIME WELL PEOPLE DELIVERING A SERVICE CAN'T BE THERE FOR A LIFE TIME SO AND WHAT'S THE ANSWER THERE AN AND A PEOPLE A WRESTLING WITH THAT ISSUE RIGHT NOW AN AND I I THINK ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE THAT IT'S IN A SENSE ON YOU A TO A POINT YOU KNOW AT THE THERAPETIC TEAM CAND TREAT YOU TO A POINT AND THEN IT BECOMES WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL PRACTICE IN A SIMILAR WAY THAT MEDITATION AS A PRACTICE IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP AND IF IT SLIPS THAN THINGS COULD SLIP AND AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS AND OR YOU HAVE A A ANOTHER PSYCHADELIC TREATMENT IN I SO PEOPLE HAVE EVEN USED THIS TERM OF PRACTICE IN RELATION TO PSYCHODELICS WHETHER'S A PSYCHADELIC PRACTICE LIKE TISE IN A A MEDITATION PRACTICE BUT I AMUSING MEDITATION AN INTENTIONALLY HERE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK THAT AND MEDITATIVE PRACTICE AN SPIRITUAL PRACTICE ELEMENTS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE COULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT COMPLIMENT TO PSYCHADELIC THERAPY AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR IN TERMS OF PROMOTING AN ABILITY TO SIT WITH A FORMA COLLEAGUE OF MIND SYD IT QUITE WELL IN RELATION TO PSYHODELICTERAPE VERSES CHRONIC FARMER COTHERAPELRE LIKE ACCESSORISE BEING ON THEM ALL THE TIME SO PSYCHADELYCTHERAPE ALLOWS YOU TO SIT WITH RATHER AN SIT ON I THOUGHT THAT'S QUITED AND YES I EN I THE MEDITATION OF MINDFULNESS AN THE ABILITY TO YES BE PRESENT SENTE BUT ALSO PRESENT SENSET AND ACCEPTING SO THINGS COME UP YOU AND WATCH AND PRICESS AND AND LET GO A THAT HOLY GRAIL OF OF MINDFULNESS  YOU KNOW A YOU KNOW AWARENESS WITHOUT REACTIVITY RESPOND I YO I EGR UP IN THE BARIA AND YOU'D HEAR THIS LANGUAGE RI AND I'M NOT BEING DISPARAGING THI SI FRIENDS THAT ARE ON THE BOARD A ESSEL AND AND WORKED ON THET YOU KNOW AND I'VE GONE THERE AND IT'S YOU KNOW AND YET YOU HEAR THESE TERMS RIGHT BE RESPONSIVE NOT REACTIVE WHICH TO A NUROW SCIENTISTS IS LIKE GRATS ON ME WHICH PROUABLY DIST MEANS I HAVE THIS SUES BUT OME AND SURELY I DO BUT YOU KNOW ELIZIC WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WRIGHT IS OR SAYING LIKE O TO BE THE OBSERVER BUT NOT BE DRAWN INTO THE EXPRENSE YOU KNOW AND AND AGAIN I DON'T BE OVERLY REDUCTIONIST BUT WHEN I FIND SO COMPELLING ABOUT THE EMERGING DATA AS IT REALLY IS DATA ON PSYCHODELICS AS TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION AND TRAMA NAMELY SULICIBE AN AND M D M A IS THAT IT REALLY SEEMS TO ALLOW PEOPLE THIS SPACE THAT THAT IS SO COMMONLY THROWN AROUND YOU KNOW GIVING SPACE BETWEEN STIMULUS INE REACTION AND VIC OR FRANKILL TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT YOU KNOWS I'VE BEEN READING A WONDERFUL BOOK CALLED THE PRINCE OF MEDICINE GOOD DATES BACK TO THE ORIGINS OF MEDICINE VERY DENSE BOOK YE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THI STUFF AND THING ABOUT THE STUFF FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS PSYCHODELIC SEEM TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO THAT BETTER VERSION OF SELF WHICH IS REMARKABLE WHAT'S ALSO REMARKABLE IT'S PERHAPS WORTH POINTING OUT IS THAT FIVE YEARS AGO I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I WOULD HAVE EEN AFRAID TO LOSE MY JOB STAMFORD MAGAZINE THIS WEEK JUST PUBLISHED AN ENTIRE ISSUE ABOUT PSYCHODELICS WITH HOWCADEMINE WORKS M D M A SYLICIB WITH THE APPROPRIATE CAUTIONARY NOTES AND THERE BUT CLEARLY TIMES OR CHANGING SPEAKING OF WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE DOING A TRIAL ON FIRST TIME USE OF PSYCHODELICS WHAT INSPIRED THAT AND WHAT ARE YOU OBSERVING AND AS OU TELL US THAT PLEASE GIVE US AM A FEW OF THE THE KY CONTOURS A WHAT'S THE DOSE AM HOWLD AR THESE SUBJECTS I MIS SOMIN ITO MEN WOMEN ARE THEY SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION OR NOT WET CAN A WHAT IT WHAT'S THE LANDSCAPE OF THAT STUDY AND I A I REALIZE US A STILL EARLY DAYS OF THE STUDY OR MAYBE IT'S COSE TO COMPLETIONS NOT YET PUBLISHED HOWEVER CRANSINAL IT'S NOT PUBLISHED IT'S NOT SUBMITTED IT IS COMPLETED SI THIS WAS ONE O ANOTHER ONE OF OUR COVITS STUDIES IN A SENSE MEANING COVIT IT AND WE HAD TO FINISH THE STUDY AND IT WAS HARD TO FINISH THE STUDY BECAUSE THE CIVE DA AS TRUE OF OUR SALISDITEPYVES IS ES A TELEPRAM ALEXORPRI TRIAL AM A WHICH IS PUBLISHED NEW ENGLANDG OF MEDICIN THAT THE THIS WAS TWENTY THAT PAPER BY THE WAY FOLKS WILL PROVIDEA LINK TO IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS AS WELL AS SOME OF ROBIN'S OTHER A PAPERS I THINK THAT TWENTY TWENTY TO NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL PAPERS REALLY FABULOUS A GIVEN IT THE DIFFERENT DOSAGES AND THE COMPARISON TO A SENTURY WHAT IS MYCRODOSING AND THE COMPARISON TO CITALOPRA YEATHES SINTRUSTING THAT YOU LINK THE WAY WE GAVE SMALL DICES OF SALICIPEANTO MYCRODISING WE DIDN'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE ANECESSARY PLESEE BY OR THE BIG BIG DICE THE TWENTY FIVE MILOGRAMS IT TI YES AND SAY THAT WE COULD SAY TO EVERY ONE WET GIVING E SALISIVEAN AND NOT BE LYING YEFOR THOSE YOU GOT AS TELEBRAM LEXT SURPRIVE OT SIX WEEKS THEY THEY GOT VERY VERY LIGHTDISE OF SOLISIDIM BUT ALLOWED US TO STANDADIZE ALL THE PSYCHITHERAPEAND SO ON BUT THE THE OTHER STUDY THAT YOURE REFERRING TO I WAS IN HEALTHIES HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS A MIDDLE AGED A AVERAGE AGE I THING WAS FORTY SI NOT YET TYPICAL STUDENT STUDY THAT AS SO OFTEN THE CASE IN PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH YA OR ONLY UNDER CRADS AND A VOLUNTEERING FOR YOUR STUDY AS SO THIS IS SAM AMORE MORE OF AN AGE RANGE AND ALSO I THINK IT WAS AN EQUAL PROPORTION OF MALAM FEMALE ALL THE STAFF ATU WETH FEMALE WHICH THE SYFLE VERY PROUD OF THEM ATHOUGH IT PRODUCES ITS ONPETENTIAL CONFOUNDER IT TO HAVE  AR ONE ONE SEX OF AF AF STAFF POSSIBLY YE THEY DID A GOOD JOB IN THE PSENSE THAT AN WE SAW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL BEING AT THE END OF THE TRIALS LET ME DESCRIBE THE DESIGN IT WAS SAY REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN MEANING PEOPLE COMM IN YOU COLLECT YOUR BASELIGNE DATA AND DO AS BRAIN SCAN AND YOU GIVE PEOPLE AN A PLECEBY WE GAVE PEOPLE OF PLACEBONE AS SHE LET ME REMIND A LITTLE BIT EVERY ONE'S HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS MIDDLE AGE NEVER TAKN A PSYCHODELIC IN THEIR LIFE NONE OF THEM ENTIRELY IN I FRESH FIRGON PEOPLE COMING IN AND AAND THE PLAN IS TO GIVE THEM THEIR FIRST EVE PSYCHDELIC EXPERIENCE O THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN THE STUDY BUT TO DO IT WE HAVE THIS REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN WITH OR FIRST GET A PLACE BO AND WE HAVE THE PROCEE BY SO THAT WE CAN DO ALL THE PROCEDURES OR THE THERUPY OR THE MUSIC LISTENING BUT NOT GIVE A WOPPING DOSE OF PSALESIBAN WE AGAIN WE GAVE THEM A PLECE BOT OS OF PSYLESIBE IN ONE MILOGRAM WE STICK E G A HAD SETS ON DURING THE EXPERIENCE TO RECORD THE BRAIN ACTIVITY AND FROM THE SCALP A THE OSCILLATING ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY AND WE DO THE EMORI SCANNING AND BEFORE AND AFTER TO SEE DEEPER INTO THE BRAIN AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY THAT WE WERE REFERRING TO EARLIER AND ALSO PROPERTIES OF BRAIN AND ATOMY WHICH WE DID IN THE STUDY SO THE THE SHORT STORY IS THE ALL OF THE CHANGES THAT WE SORE BOTH PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND EUROE BIOLOGICALLY WERE SEEN WITH THE TWENTY FIVE MILOGRAMS IT ALL HAPPENED WITH THAT BIG WOPPING DOSE AND WHAT DID WE SEE WHILE WE DID SEE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING WE SAW WHAT I CALL THE INTROPIC BRAIN EFFECT WHICH IS AT HE FORMERLY QUITE AACCURATE WE SEE AN INCREASE IN THE INFORMATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF ON GOING BRAIN ACTIVITY RECORDED WITH THE E G ON THE DOSE OF SALICIBEN THE ACTIVITY BECOMES MORE COMPLEX IT'S HARDER TO PREDICT ACROSS TIME IT'S MORE INFORMATIONLY RICH AND THAT EFFECT CORRELATES AS IT DOES VERY RELIABLY WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS ARE THE BIGGER THE TRIP THE BIGGERES IN TROPIC BRAIN EFFECT AND NOU PRETTY WELL REPLICATED FINDING AND BUT THEN THE M AR THE EMARI AND SEEING DEEP INTO THE BRIN WAS PROBABLY AMOST EXCITING RESULT WHERE WE DIDN'T JUST SEE SOME FUNCTIONAL BRAIN CHANGES BUT WE'VE SEEN SOME ANATOMICAL BRAIN CHANGES AS WELL AND WE USED TO TECHNIQCALLED DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING THAT LOOKS AT THE CABLING OF THE BRAIN THE WHITE MATTER TRACTS WE SAW A CHANGE IN MAJOR TRACT SO WE WE SOR OF LIMITED OUR SEARCHPLACE TE REALLY THICK TRACTS AND REALLY THICK FIBERS AND HE FIBERS THAT CAME THROUGH AS CHANGING THE ONES THAT TRAVELLED BETWEEN THE PREFRONT OF QUARTEC AND AND THE THULOMESS AND ASTRIAT AND AND THERE WERE TWO TRACTS TO PREFRONTAL TRACTS THE CHANGED AND THEY CHANGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DECREASE IN ACTIAL DEFUCIVITY WHICH AN COULD BE INTERPRETED AS TRACT INTEGRITY WHERE A DECREASE WOULD BE AN INCREASE INTRACT INTEGRITY IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN THE ATIAL DE FUCIVITY DECREASES AS THE BRAIN GOES FROM BEING A BABY TO BEING A ADULT ACTAL DHE FUCIVITY GOES DOWN AND AN ENAGING AND THOLOGIES OF AGING ACTAL DE FUCIVITY GOES UP SO WIS IS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IF OF THE RESULTS YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN TERMS OF BRAIN CONACTIVITY OF A SORT OF INCREASED COMMUNICATION ACROSS EREAS IF I UNERSIN CORRECTLY AND AM PERFECTLY HAPPEN TO BE WRONG BRYTHER WAY THAT THIS DECREASE IN AXIOL UM DIFFUSIVITY IS TRANSLATES TO A HIGHER FIDELITY OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTAX AND THE THALYMUSANSTRAD AM AS OPPOSED TO LASS AND YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THIS IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THE THE UNTRANSITION FROM BABYHOOD AND CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD A SPEAKS TO THE SAME WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A MASSIVE CALLING OF CONNECTIONS I SUPPOSED A GROWTH OF CONNECTIONS SO IN OTHERWORDS AS WE GET OLDER WE GET BETTER AT DOING CERTAIN THINGS AND LESS GOOD AT DOING POTENTIALLY MOST EVERYTHING ELSE IS THAT RIGHT ISH BECAUSE THE CHANGE WAS ANATOMICAL AN AND NOT FUNCTIONAL SO THE OTHER STUFF WAS IS REALLY MEASURING AN COMMUNICATION IN IN THE BRAIN BY LOOKING AT HOW THE ACTIVITY FLUCTUATES ACROSS TIME AND WHETHER THER'S FLUCTUATIONS IN ACTIVITY A SINCRINESS BETWEEN REGIONS AND IF THEY ARE WE SAY THAT FUNCTIONALLY CONNECTED AND WE INFER THAT THAT TALKING TO EACH OTHER CAUSE THEY GO UP AND DOWN IN SINCRANY BUT WHEN IT COMES THE ANATOMY WITH TALKING ABOUT THE JUSTATIC OU NO MATERIAL STAFF AND A A SO WIT SEEING THE FIBERS IN APPROPERTY OF THE FIBERS CHANGE AN AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE THINK AND RECENTLY WE HAD AN INDEPENDENT PERSON COME IN AND REANALYZE THE DAY TACUSAND I ONE OF THESE THINGS INCREDIBLE FINDING REQUIES AND I CREDIBLE EVIDENCE REALLY STRONG EVIDENCE AND ANI WOULD SAY THE EVIDENCE OF MYMIS MONT STUDIES I WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ON THAT BUT WE DID REAN ANALYZE IT AND USED THIS AN CORRECT ION PROCEEGE O FREE WATER CORRECTION TO BE MORE SURE THAT IT WAS A CHANGE IN IN THE ACTUAL MICROUS STRUCTURE RATHER IN SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE EXEXTRACALULEUS SPACE THAT THE WATER SURROUNDING THE FIBRES AND IT CAME THROUGH IN FACT THE THE CHANGE WAS STRENGTHENED BY DOING THIS CORRECTIONS STHAP SESARN AR THIS IS NEURA PLASTERSITY AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF ONE FIRST TIME SESSION WITH TWENTY FIVE MILOGRAMS OF SORE IREN YE YE SO WE'RE EXCITED AND AND THE N HEL WUS IT BE DIFFERENT YE KNOW THE SECOND ANALISS COMING IN I WASN'T SURE SHE BELIEVED IT AND THEN SHE YEN I THOUGHT THIS CORRECTION TECHNIQUE MIGHT CONNIKILL THE RESULT AND AND IT CAME THROUGH AND AND SHES IT OCADEN NOW I AM EXCITED TO SAY WE'LL SAY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FUNCTIONALLY WE DON'T KNOW HOW DID THE PEOPLE CHANGE WHILE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AS I SAID TER WELL BEING IMPROVED WE DID LOOK AT THAIT COGNITION AND WE IS THE ACCOGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY PARADINE THAT LOOKS AT PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO NOTICE A RULE CHANGE AND THEN FLEXIBLY ADAPT THEIR BEHAVIOUR BASED ON NOTICING THIS RULE CHANGE AND PEOPLE IMPROVED AFTER THE TWENTY FIVE MILOGRAMS AND DIDN'T SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE AFTER THE PLACE BY TOSE THERE WEREN'T CORRELATIONS WITH THE THE DETII CHANGE THAT THE CABLING CHANGE AND THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES BUT YOU KNOW  WITH THESE STUDIES IN SMALLER SAMPLE SIZES YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE THOSE CORRELATIONS COME THROUGH AM SO IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS BUT IT'S IT'S A CHANGE IN BRAIN ANATOMY THAT'S IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO WHAT YOU SEE IN AN AGING BRAIN OR WITH PATHOLOGY OF AGING AND IT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN A HEALTHY BRAIN AS IT GOES ROOM YEN A NORMAL NEURO DEVELOPMENT INTO ADOTHOOD VERY VERY EXCITING AND INTRIGUING AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE LIGHTED THAT IS JUST ONE STUDY ALTHOUGH FROM EVERYTHING YOUV SAID IT SOMESLI BEEN DONE WITH IMMENSE RIGOR SO WE WILL EAGERLY AWAIT THE PUBLICATION OF THAT STUDY AND US WE CAN PERUSE ALL THE DAY DONE AND THE SUBSEQUENT STUDIES I WANT TO HEAR A BIT ABOUT THE STUDY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT ON THE USE OF CYLICIBON FOR THE TREATMENT OF FIBRA MY ALGIA I'M ENTRETE BY FIBRE MY ALGIA I COULD BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD FRIEND WHO ALSO I WON'T REVEAL WHO IT IS AND KNOW IT'S NOT MEAN THIS ISN'T THAT I HAVE A FRIEND THING WHO ALSO IS A SCIENTIST WHOS A A SITS IT A FAIRLY HIGH POSITION IN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH WHO AM QUIETLY HAS EXPRESS TO ME THAT THEY ARE INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE FACT THAT AM THE STANDARD MEDICAL COMMUNITY HAS AM LARGELY IGNORED FIBRE MY ALGIA A AND THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS A KIND OF LUMPED WITH THINGS LIKE CHRONIC FATIGUE CYNDRUM AND OTHER AM SO CALLED AGAIN SO CALLE I'M NOT SAYING THIS BUT PEOPLE OFFERIN FOR T THESE IS OH IT'S PSYCHOSEMATIC THAT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD WHICH IS A NARROW SCIENTIST IS A RIDICULOUS STATEMENT TO HEAR BECAUSE IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD YOUR BRAIN AS IN YOUR HEAD AFTER ALL YOUR PHYSIOLOGY AND YOUR PSYCHOLOGY OUR INFLUENCING EACH OTHER OF COURSE AND IN THE THE WORLD IS STARTING TO APPRECIATE THAT MORE BUT FIRST OF ALL AM MAYBE COULD TELL PEOPLE WHAT FIBRA MA ALGIA IS WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO DO A STUDY ON FIBR MY ALGIA USING SYLLICIRAN OF ALL THINGS AM EAUSE THAT' SURPRISING TO ME AND AM IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO OR IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA AND AM IN MIND A SHARE WITH US ALOWE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU'R DISCOVERING IN THAT IN THAT STUDY SURELY HAPPY TAY SAY AGAIN IT'S SOHT A SOBINTARPY AN POPULATION IS FIBRY MALGUST IN DRIME SAY THIS IS PEOPLE PRESENTING WHERE THE GENERALIZED CHRONIC PAIN SO UNLIKE SOME OTHER PAIN DISORDERS WHERE THE PAIN IS FOCUS YOU CAN SAY IT'S MY LOWA BACK WHICH IS VERY COMMON A CHRONICLOA BAC PIN THIS IS ORE GENERALIZED AND IT AND FOR THAT REASON IT'S HARD TO SO KNOW WHAT IT IS AND AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEIN A CONTROVERSIAL SPACE IN MEDICINE AND IT'S BEIN YET IT'S HAD THAT CHARGE THROWN AT IT THAT MAY BE PSYCHIPSOMATIC AN JUST TO YOUR POINT AN IS ANYTHING EVER YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT OF OF THE MIND ANYWAY BUT THIS IS ATUALLY AF FASCINATING SPACE FOR HOW IN A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE TH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND THE MIND CAN INFLUENCE THE BODY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME REALLY INTERESTING LITERATURE AROUND THE ETIOLOGY LIKE THE HOW THE PAIN HAS COME ABOUT INNOSENCE LIKE WHAT CAUSE THE PAIN WHAT'S THE STORY THERE AND A HEAD OF THE TRIAL I WOULD SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES LET'S JUST BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THERE IS SOME FASCINATING LITERATURE AROUND THINGS LIKE AM A BACKGROUND OF TRAMER AND AM HOW AM ITTHAT CAN RELATE TO ISSUES RELATED TO INFLAMMATION AND HOW THAT CAN EXPRESS INTO THINGS LIKE FIVERA MILE JESINDROME I JUST AD BE VERY CAREFUL THAT BECAUSE IF YOU GO IN WITH AN ASSUMPTION THAT HARE'S SOME VERY TRAMER FOR EXAMPLE THAN AE'S THAT HOLE I'LL DESIDE OF PSYCHONALYSIS THE MASSIVELY TRIPED IT UP AROUND FALSE MEMORY AND SO ON AND SO PLEASE DON'T HOLD PRIR REPSUMPTIONS THAT YOU GON ARE UNCOVER AM VERY TROMER IN EVERY CASE NOW THE TEAMER TREATED I THINK EIGHT PEOPLR AM AND IT'S GOING IT IS GOING VERY WELL AGAN I JUST WONA BE CAREFUL WITH HOW I DESCRIBE IT TO MA IN A TO MANAGE EXPECTATIONS AND NOT GET TO BE CARRIED AWAY BUT I I CHECK HIM WITH THE TEAM EVERY WEEK AND AM THERE' STILL BASED IN LONDON DOING THE WORK AM AND A IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT I HEAR ABOU THE PROFOUND EXPERIENCES THET PEOPLE HAVE UNDER THE DRUG IN THIS STUDY WE ONLY GIVE ONE DICE IT'S A VERY MECHANISTIC STUDY WE AR SO HAVE THE E G CAP ON IN THE SESSIONS AMLIKEIN THE HEALTHY VOLUNTIS THADY BU THIS TIME NOW TAKING INTO CLINICAL POPULATION AND THAT SO THEY'RE IN THE IME THEY'RE THEY ARE WEARING AN IMASK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF TWENTY FIVE MELEGRAMS OF SOSIVON MOST OF THEM PROBABLY HAVE NOT DONE SOSIVON BEFORE SO TO LITL BIT LIKE THE FIRST TIME STUDY IN SOME SENSE THEY HAVE AN FIBRO MY ALGA THAT'S DEBILITATING IN SOME WAY THAT THEY DON'T THEY WANT THEY DON'T WANT IT OBVIOUSLY AND DURING THE SESSION ARE THEY THINKING ABOUT THEIR PAIN ARE THEY BEING TOLD TO THINK ABOUT THEIR PAIN THEY'RE NOT BEING TOLD TO THINK ABOUT THE PAIN IN FACT AN AS I UNDERSTAND IT WHILE THERE IS A THE REPEATIC MODEL AROUND ECCEPTANCE OF THE PAIN IT IS AN UNUNLIKE SOMEOF THE PETIESTY WORK YOU ON ENCOURAGING THEM TO FOCUS ON YOU KNOW THE INDEX TROMA AND THEN EN I WORK THROUGH IT IN TRYING DIGEST IT WE WE DON'T DO THAT WITH THE PAIN TO THE PAINS THERE AN BUT THERE ISN'T AN INVITATION TO FOCUS ON IT AND THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES WITH CLASSIC PSYCHODELIC THERAPE VES IS EMPTY A MAY THERAPE ARGUBLY M DI MATHERAPIES MORE LIKE BIT CLOSER TO TRADITIONAL TALK THERAPE WHET THERE IS MORE DIALOGUE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO TALK ON EMPDY MAY AM IN THE EMPDIAMATRIALS TO YOU A KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY USED IMASKS  OR BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN AS YOU DESCRIBE THE THERAPEUTIC TRIP VERSES THE TRIP THAT ONE DOES OF GOING INTO THE WOODS AND TAKING SILK THEN TAKE ASLSAEN IN THE WOODS OR AT A PARTY OR A WHILE STARING AT A POSTER OR WOR IT WORE A LEAF AM AGAIN ON NOT TRY TO TRIVIALIZE THOSE EXPERIENCES OF AN OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN BE PROFOUND BUT AM SO I AM TOLD AM BUT A THE MD  MA TRIALS AM SEEM TO INVOLVE AS YOU SAID MORE MORE DIRECTED A DIALOGUE AM IN SOMETIMES EVEN KIND OF EMPATHIC CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE BY THEIR ACTUALLY LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER TTHE EYES AND I CONTACT ING SUCH A KEEP PART OF A THE HUMAN A SOCIAL COGNATIVE CONNECTIVE NET WORKS A SO DO YOU KNOW IF THEY PUT IMASKS ON PEOPLE DURING THE TIM BE PRETTY SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE E MUSK THER CAUS A LOT OF THE EMDIA MAY A WORK AND I WAS PART OF AN EMDIA MA TRIAL AM A IT WAS AM AS I UNDERSTAND GERE TOWARD DEVELOPING BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPATHAGEAND EMPATHY TOWARD THE SELF  IAM PRETTY SURE THEY HAVE THE I MUSKS THER BUT THEY PROBABLY AND IT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE YOU CU FORMERLY TEST THIS IT PROBABLY DON'T USE THEM AS MUCH  E THINGS WITH THE CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS IF YOUARE LOOKING AT YOUR GUIDES YOUR FACILITATES S IN THEIR FACES A MELTING O WHAT AE YON INDIA MA JUST MI REALLY START TO FEEL WE'RE CONNECTED E MIN IS GA ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL AND  NITER AAND AND YET AES THAT A FASCINATING EFFECT OF LOVING IU KNO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WITH AM AND SA  I IMAGINE THEY TALK MORE AND USE THE EYESHADES LESS AND IT IS MORE INTERPERSONAL RATHER MY INTERAPUSMOR GOING INSIDE THEY DO USE A FASCINATING TIM ANOLOGY THAT SOME PEOPLE OV CRITIGUE BUT IT IS A VERY INTERESTING A PHENOMENON AND IT'S THIS NOTION OF THE INNA HELA THEY USE THAT AT LANGUAGE A LOT S BEEN CRETY CAUSE IT SOUNDS VERY SUGGEST IVE ONN THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE VEHICLES HERE DRIVING THE TEREPUTIC PRICESS IS SUGGESTION I THINK OUT TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT AN AH BUT A SO WHEN THEY GO INSIDE THAT'S ANOTHER TERM THAT WE USE VERY MUCH IN THE CLASSIC SICADELIC THERAPE WORK YOU GO INSIDE YOU KNAY PUT THE EYE SHADES ON AND PEOPLE ARE ENCOURAGE TO GO INSIDE YOU KNOW AN BUT WHEN THEY DO THAT IN THE END MAY WORK ESPECIALLY THEY MIGHT BE TOLD EXPLICITLY AND LISTEN TO THE INNER HEULAR YOU KNOW AN THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE HE COULD SEE HOWA A CYNIC OR A SCEPTIC CAL COME IN AND AND SEE THAT SOME KIND OF LIKE SUGGESTIVE PRIMING OR BUYASING I THIN THEY THEY HAVE POINT A SCEPTICS OFTEN DO BUT I I DON'T THINK IT IT'S AT ALL OF THE STORY AND BRIEFLY CAUSE IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT AN SPEAKING TO THAT POINT A BIT IN OUR SALISIBIN THERA BEVASIS AS TELEPRAM TRIAL WE MEASURED PRETRIAL EXPECTANCY AND WE DID IT FOR BOITH'S CONDITIONS SO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENT DO YOU EXPECT WITH THE LEXIRPRI THE ESTO TELEPRAM AT THE END OF THE TRIAL AND WHAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENT IF YOU GO INTO THE SALISIBIN ARM AND GET A BIG TOO BIG DICES OF SALISIBEN WHAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENT DO YOU THINK YOU SEEN TAT IN IN THAT AM AND N O COURSE IT WAS A POINFLIP AS TO WHAT ARM PEOPLE WENT INTO AND THERE WAS NO CROSS OVER AND AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS IT WAS TRUE THAT WE HAD A AN A SAMPLE BYUS SA MOST PEOPLE HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS ON AVERAGE OF A HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR SALISIBEN AND IT'S EFFICACY OR EFFECTIVENESS THUS IS THE ASSESSARIDE ELEXORPRAY AND HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CORRELATION OR THE PREDICTIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRETRILE EXPECTANCY AND RESPONSE WE SAW THE PRETRIL EXPECTANCY FOR THE ASETELEPRA PREDICTED RESPONSE TO ASCE TELEPRAM A CROSSPOTUALLY EVERY SINGLE MEASURE ALL THESE DIFFERENT MEASURES OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND WELL BEING AND AND I THINK NONE OF THE SCALES I'M PRETTY SURE IT IS NONE OF ABOUT TWELVE OR SO MANTAL HEALTH ARATING SCALES WAS THERE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRETRIL EXPECTANCY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS HIGH IT DIDN'T PREDICT PRETRILE EXPECTANCY DIDN'T PREDICT RESPONSE TO THE SALICIDE INTERAPHE SAY THAT WAS A BIT OF A YOU KNOWS SMASH ON A HED FOR THE IDEA THAT THAT CLASSIC PSYCODELICTARAPEES SOME KIND OF PLACY BY RESPONSE I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION AND BECAS SAN IF IT DOESN'T COME THROUGH AS IT DIDN'T IS IT DIDN'T COME TRUTE THEN IT IT OPENS UP EVEN MORE INTRIGUE ABOUT WELL WHAT IS IT THAT IF IT'S NOT JUST TE PLACE BY RESPONSE OR RASUPERPLICY BY RESPONSE LIKE AN AMPLIFICATION OF THE PLACY BY RESPONSE THEN IT MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE AND HOW INTRIGUING IT HAS A DIRECT THE REPEATED ACTION IT MUST BE SOMETHING AND WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT IT IS I TALKED ABOUT THE THE RESIDUAL IN A INCREASIN GLOBLE CONACTIVITY THATS ONE POSSIBILITY BUT THE TRUTH IS WITH WERE JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE AND YET THE THERAPEUTIC OUT COMES IR AGAIN JUST SO MARVILS MARVELLOUSLY IMPRESSIVE AM I'M CURIOUS AS TO WI AS WELL THERE ARE THAT MANY LABS SBUT THE THE LABORATORIES THETARE O FOCASTON CLASSICS ECADELICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND AND NOW AS YOU MENTIOND PROMISING RESULTS FOR INTERACION FAPROMYALGE AS WELL ALTHOUGH PRELIMINARY PRINT VERY PROMISING OH WHY THE A LACK OF ATTENTION TO IT A EWESTY AN IS IT THAT ELISTY TRIPS ARE JUST TOO LONG IS IT THAT THEY ARE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT AM ARE THERE ANY DATA ON AM NON MICRODOSES OF ELESTIN HERE I WONT TO BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE I LEARNED THROUGH BY INTERACTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THIS TER MICRODOSES AM VERY MISLEADING AND IN SOME CASES CAN BE DANGEROUSLY MIS LEADING BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THE EFFECTIVE PCYCHODELICDOSE OR YOU KNOW THE EFFECTA MEANING THAT CAN INDUCE A A A REAL TRIP WITH HALLUCINATIONS ET CETERA A OF ELESTE IS ACTUALLY IN THE MICRO GRAHAM RANGE SO SOME PEOPLE HERE MICRODOSE AND THEY THINK MICROGRAM OF ELESTE IS A MICROGRAHMS IS A MICRODOSE WHEN IN FACT A MACRODOSE OF ELESTE CAN BE MEASURED IN MICROGRAMS RIGHTS O THIS IS WHERE A YOU KNOW IN THE ABSENCE OF SCIENTIFIC TRAINING PEOPLE CAN REALLY GO GO ASTRAY A OR EVEN IN JUS IN LAC OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE METRIC SYSTEM AND SINCE NOW YERO YA YOURE RECENT A RIVALS YES FORTUNATE FOR US SORRY ENGLAND'S LOSS AS IS THE USAS GAINED BY AF A ROBIN'S LAP A MOVE FROM  FROM ENGLAND TO A THE UNITED STATES RECENTLY SO SQUARE ONE FOR US AM BUT WHY ISN'T THERE MORE USE OF ELESTE IN THESE TRIALS I THINK I IT PROBABLY IS THE DURATION OF THE TRIP IT USED TO BE STICMA A AND IT WAS EASIER TO GET YE SONASIBIN STUDY THREE BECAUSE OTHES WERE THEY WERE GETTING THAT TRUE AO IS STELIKE O FRANCS VOLEN VIDERIN ZURIC N SWITZERLAND AND THAN RODIN GRIFFIS COMING ALONG INTOIN A SONASIBIN LAK HOPKINS SAY YOU COULD APPEAL TO THAT PRECEDENT SINCE SAY WHAT I DOING IT IVDA AN I COME WE NOT DO IN AN LITTLE ENGLAND AM  THAT'S HOW IT WORK FOR US WE DID AT YOU GO ON ANDO IN ALESTY STUDY ONCE WED KIND OF LAID TE FOUNDATIONS AN FOR DOING THIS KIND OF WORK AND IT WAS A BRAIN IMAGING STUDY WAS REALLY EXTENSIVE ONE ATUALLY WHER WE YOUS BOTH AMARI AND ANOTHER MITALITY COD EMG AM SOT OF SUPER EG IN A SENSE AN BUT E YOU KNOT WHY DIDN'T WE AN WHY DIDN'T THAT TURN OUR HEADS TO THINK O SHOULD WE NOT BE DOING OUR TRAULS WITH ALAST IT'S I DOES HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH E PRAGMATICS LIKE A STUDY DAY WITH SOLICIDENISS LONG ENOUGH IT'S A FORD TOR SIX HOUR TRE IN THE EFTIE O ASK US TO HAV THE PEOPLE IN THE LABAN UNTIL EIGHT HOURS PICED DICE WITH PERSONY I THINK COULD BE QUITE EXCESSIVE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A LODICE OU KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT THE PRECEI BY CONDITION AS WELL IT BECOMES ALONG IN PRACTICAL YE SCIENTISTS ARE NOT PAID NEARLY ENOUGH TO WARRANT THE A THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS OVER TIME IN FORTHE GRADUATE STUDENS IN BOSTOIT'S OFTEN AT THES UNI MORGENIA MEMBERS TAT A DOING THAT READY HOT WER  IT WAS DESCRIBVARY WELL TO ME BY A A STUDENT WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT SAID TO ME THEY REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY US BY THE HOUR ECAUSEESY WORK I HE WAS A ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIST OR HE WOULD RUN EXPERIMENTS NO JOKE FOLKS THREE TO FIVE DAY EXPERIMENTS SLEEPING IN BOUTS OF TWO HOURS HERE OR THERE IN A DARK ROOM WITH A BUNCH OF EQUIPMENT IN A RECORDING SO THESE ARE LONG LONG ACUTER PHYSIAL PHYSIOLOGICAL EELECTRA PHYSIOLOGICAL REQORRINGE SO AN YET NO NO SCIENTIST DOES IT FOR THE MONEY I PROMISE YOU A THAT THERE IS MONEY IN FARMER THERE IS NOT MONEY IN A PERSONAL INCOME A IT'S NOT LUCRATIVE IF FOR THE BASIC SCIENTIST A SO YES I ELESTY IS WHAT A ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO FIFTEEN HOURS SOMETIAHIN WOULD BE A LITTLE LONG YE BE WORRIED IF YE WAS STILL TRIPPING AT THAT TIME MAYBE WITH A RI BIG TIS I AS K UT YET EIGHT HOURS FLUS AND DICE DEPENDENT YET IT'S A BIGODISE ITS I A LONGER EXPENSE BUT YOU NAF GIN A DICE AT SAY AND I TEN I M IN THE MORNING WHICH IS MOR LESS HAVIT OFTEN GUISE THAN THAT SIX P M STILL FEELING THE EFFECTS AND THEN HOW LONGT YOU WAIT NOW TO KINDO CLOSE TINGS OW BEFORE THEY CAN GO HIME EVEN WITH SALICIBIN YA PEOPLE STILL AT WORK INTO THE EVENING AND THE STAFF WERE AWAYS THER LAHTS OR F COURSK AS THEY GO TO PACK UP AND YES SAID THESE SALONG DAYS AND IT AND IT'S JUST IT IT IT'S TOO MUCH AND I THAT MAKES ENSE O YOUR PRACTICAL CONSTRAINS I LEARN FROM A A RECENT GUEST ON THE SPOTCAST AND I THAT WE RECORDED WITH A DOCTOR SATCHAN PIENDO IS A COLGU MIND WHEN I WAS DOWN AT THE SALL INSTITUTE IS A PINIER TA LOT OF THE STUDIES ON SO CALLED INTERMITTENT FASTAND THAT THE REASON THE INTERMITTENT FAT A THAT THAT THE EATING PERIOD AN THESE STUDIES IN ANIMALS AND NOW ON HUMANS IS EIGHT HOURS THE SOR FEEDING WINDOW IN THESE TASES BECAUSE A'M THE GRADUATE STUDENT WAS' GOING TO OTHERWISE LOSE THEIR RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS SAYS LISTEN YOU CAN BE IN THE LAB FOR TWELVE HOURS THAT MEANT SOME HOURS BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT THAN EIGHT HOURS AND THEN SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS BUT YOU CAN'T STAY IN THERE LONGER AND AND MANY PEOPLE USE THE EIGHT HOUR FEEDING WINDOW AS A CONSEQUENCE SO THE SIENCEIT HAS TO EXIST IN AN BE CARRIED OUT IN REAL WORLD FRAME  AA O I AS EMPTY A MAZ A LITTLE BIT AM A LITTLE BIT SHORTER WRITE ITS ABOUT A FORTUS IT'S ALSO ABOUT FORTIS YES SIR AND ASSIMILAR TO SALICIBAN YET IS AN NATCHY IN THE MAPS WORK THEY READ DIS AFTER A SERTAIN POINT TO THE BOUST THE BU HVPE  THE OPTIONAL BISTA YES SAY SO THERE IS THAT AM AND NOW PEOPLE AR THINKING WELL EVEN THESE SALICIBIN SESSIONS A LONG AN EXPENSIVE AND IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO STAFF MEMBERS THER ALL THE TIME THAT SIX SPENSIVNE N US WHER MY TO THE EXPENSIS IS IN THE STARCING SO CAN WE ABRIDGE THE EXPERIENCE MAKE IT SURE TO AND GET AWAY WITH IS AND GET GET SIMILAR KIND OF THERAPIECE OUTCOMS IT IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT DIRECTION MAY ASK ABOUT I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT BAT I WANT O MAYTURI DON'T FORGET TO ASK ABOUT COMBINATION SYLICIVE AN M D  MAY THERAPIECE THE REASON I ASK BUT THIS IS I'M AND HERE TRULY NOT ME BUT I KNOW PEOPLE WHO I'M DO SELF ADMINISTERED A I'M COMBINATION SYLICIVAN AND M D A MAY I' I THINK I'VE THIS RIGHT I THINK IT'S CALLED A HIPPY FLIP IM THERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT OF ALL ZEALOUSTY TO AGAIN I'M NOT SUGGESTING PEOPIL DO THESE KIND OF DRUG COMBINATIONS BUT I'M THE WAY IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME WAS THAT THE SYLICIBIN BECAUSE IT'S SO SERATON URGIC I'M  SOMETIMES CAN BE NOT A DOWNER BUT CAN HAVE A BIT OF A KIND OF A KIND OF A MURKY FEEL TO IT SOME REAL DEEP INTRUSPECTION SOMETIMES IN THE THE DARKER REALMS OF ONES PSYCHE DEPRESSIVE THOUGHTS ET CETERA NOT THAT IT NESSERLY STAYS THAT WAY THROUGHOUT THE TRIP BUT THAT THE MD AMA BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY STRONGLY SERCH AND URGIC BUT ALSO DOPEMANURGIC I MAN SORT THIS HAS AN EMPHEDEMING COMPONENT A COCANE LIKE IN FACT I'M IF YOU EVER SEENS O ONE IN EMDY A MA THEIR PUPILS ARE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A A QUARTERS AH FOR REASON THERE I I YOU KNOW 'M EXTREMELY EXTREME AUTONOMIC AROUSAL COMPARED TO A SEDATIVE IM WHICH BY THE WAY WOULD CONSTRICT THE PUPILS IM SO THEY DESCRIBE THE USE OF EMDY A MADE A KIND OF BALANCE OUT THE KIND OF AFFECT COMPONENT OF IT I'M WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON COMBINATION SYLICIVE AN M D A MAY I DOES THIS HOLD ANYTHEREPEUTIC POTENTIAL THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BACK YARD CHEMISTRY I'M IN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE OR VENAM CAN COWBOING THE STUFF ON THEIR OWN WHICH AGAIN I DON'T REALLY RECOMMEND I LIKE TO SEE THE SCIENCE GO FIRST BUT I UNDERSTAND THIS IS HOW T WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD AM THERE WOUD I WULD YOUR THOUGHT ON IN COMBINING COMPOUNT YET I GUESS THE COWBOYING IT IN RE CREATIONAL CONTEXT BUT ALSO UNDERGROUND THERAPISTS TO WORK WITH THIS COMPA THAT'S WHAT I'M REFRAIND YE I AM NOT TIING MY PEOPLE PARRONING WITH THE STUFF I'M DNG OUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS NOW OF A THERAPISTS THAT OFFER A SECOND ARCTHERAPES ILLEGALLY REALLYCAUSE IT'S NOT LEGALLYNOTHNLY YOU HAS TO POSSESS YOURSELF AM BUT THAT ARE DOING THIS YESTHAT'S REALLY WHY IMAST YE AND YOU KNOW I THINK THARS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL WITH HIS AS A SCIENTIST BUT IN NO IF THEYRE DOING IT ARE THEY USING SOME KIND OF TRIAL AN ERA THE SAME IS TRUE OF COURSE WITH THE OU NO LONGER HISTORY OF PSYCHODELIC PLANT MEDICINE USIF BY PLANTS WE INCLUDE THE FANGI AS WELL SAY EXIN THE EXTENDED SENSE PLANTS YEN NO THERE WILL HAVE BEEN TRIAL AN ERROR THERE IT MIGHT NOT BE AS SYSTEMATIC AS THE SCINCE WE DO TO DAY BUT MAYBE THERE'S BEEN A LEARNING PROCESS AND MAYBE WHAT THEY DO AN THEY'VE COME TO BECAUSE THEY FOUND IT WORKS SAY BY THAT PRINCIPLE I'M INTERESTED IN THAT COMBINATION AND WHETHER IT DOES AM OFFER SOME ADVANTAGES MAYBE IN CERTAIN PATIENCE YOU KNOW IF WE ONE OF THE BUST TERMS IN MEDICINE THESE DAYSIS PRECISION MEDICINE A PRECISION MEDICINE AN PERSONALISED MEDICINE SAY MAYBE THERE ARE CERTAIN CASES WHERE YOU NO INTRODUCING AM SAY SOLICIBIN AFTER THE EMDY MAY OR THE OTHER WAY ROUND CULD OFFERSOME ADVANTAGES AND THE DIFFERENCES ARE INTERESTING YOU KNO SOLICIBEN CAN GET YOU TO DEEP PLACES MAYBE YOU KNOW THE COLONEL OF YOUR SUFFERING AND AND A MAJOR LIFE EXPERIENCES AND COMPLEXES THE DA CAUSILY LINK TO WHATEVER THE PATHOLOGY THAT YOU'RE PRESENTING WITH AM BUT IT CAN DO IT SOMETIMES QUITE AGGRESSIVELY AN I AND IF IT SAY PYSHAR MAT'S EXTRESSE DISORDER IT CAN BE OVERWHELMING AND YOU CONFIT IT AND REALLY IT'S THAT IT'S THE YOU KNOW THE RESISTANCE IS REALLY CHALLENGED AND THEY FIGHT BACK AND THE THEREPETES IT BREAKS THROUGH AND THE PROGRESS ISN'T HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'VE AGITATED THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS WHERE IS WA EMDY MAY OFFERS IS SOMETHING ARGUBLY MORE DIRECTIONALLY RELIABLE IN TERMS OF IN TOMES OF THE VAILANCE LIKE IT'S MORE DIRECTIONALLY POSITIVE GENERALLY AND EMDI MAY EXPERIENCEOR DAVER BAD TIME ON A YE YOU LEME QUITE BLOND AND BY ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAD  WITH EMDIAMY I'VE NEVER DONE IT RECREATION I HAVE HAD NOT AND HAVE NOT EVER DONE IT RECREATIONALLY BUT WHEN IT WAS DONE IN THIS THE APEUTIC SAIDING I REALIZED BECAUSE THERE WAS MUSIC ON AT THE BEGINNING I ASKED YOU ACTUALLY ASKED THEM TO TURN IT OFF BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT THE AN THE MUSIC WAS BECOMING SUCH AN ATTRACTOR TO MY ATTENTION THAT I SUDDENLY WAS SEARING YTHING ABOUT MUSIC AND MY LOVE OF MUSIC WHICH WAS NOT THE FOCUSS OF THE SESSION THAT I A SOU WAS THERE T FOR AM AND I'M GLAD THAT THEY DID TURN THE MUSIC OFFIC IS THE MOMENT THEY DID I WAS ABLE TO DROP IN WITHIN THE IM ASKED TO THIS TO THE SORT OF GO INWARD AND ADDRESS SOME CERTAIN ISSUES THAT AT LEAST TO ME FELT KEY AND PRODUCTIVE AM SO THAT SEEMS TO BE THE KIND OF A HAZARD WITH EM DOA MA IS THAT I IT'S SUCH AN IMPATHAGEAND THAT A ONE COULD I START TO YOU COULD GO DOWN ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AN RABBIT HOLES YE YET BUT BUT IT'S ALSO IT'S A STRENGTH BECAUSE YOU WELL YOU KNOW THE CLASSICS LIKE SOLICIPIN CAN TAKE YOU THAT VERY RELIABLY BUT MAYBE AGGRESSIVELY AND I MAY MAKES IT EASIER TO GO THERE AND AND THAT'S ITS STRENGTH AND THAT'S WHY THAT MARRIAGE OF THEM TIT MAYTHERAPEFAPETOSY AND PARTICULAR S IT IS IT GOOD COM BY IT WORKS BECAUSE YOU ARE GIN A GO THERE INNOCENCE YOU HAVE TO TO REALLY MAKE THE THEROPEATIC PROGRESS YOU CANNOT HAVE TO GO BACK THERE AM BUT WE WE CAN A SENIT UP SI THAT YOU CAN GO BACK THERE AND FEEL AS SAFE AREM AM MORE TRUSTING AND BE ABLE TO GO BACK THERE WHERE IS YOU'VE NEVER OTHERWISE BEING ABLE TO GO BACK THERE WITHOUT AN I DESSOCIATING OR HAVING IN A HORABLE FLASH BACKS AND SO ON SI AM THAT'S THE STRENGTH THAT IT OFFERS I GUESS THE LIMITATION WOULD BE THE MAYBE IT DOESN'T TAKE YOU AS TE AS THE A CLASSIC PSYCADELICSON I TEND TO THINK I'M BASTILNISS WONA AS A KIND OF HONESTY TO THE CLASSICS IN THAT IT IS IT IS HELL AS WELL AS HEAVEN OU NI AND THAT'S THE PSYCHE IT IS IN ALL ROS IS I I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE'S SUCH A FEAR OF A I SO CALLED BAD TRIPS THERE'S SUCH A FEAR A IN NONPSYCADA STATES TO AM TO AVOID THAT THE PAINFUL AND EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WE KNOW FROM TRAMA AN THE A TREATMENT OF TRAMAN WE'VE HAD SEVERAL GUESTS ON HERE MY CLOSE COLLY CLOSE CLOSE COLY GAT SANPHRD DOCTOR A DAVID SPEAK AUR ASSOCIATURE OF PSYCHIETRY IS CLYNCOLYPNOTIS AMAZING AMAZING HUMAN BEING IN SCIENTIST INCLINATION SIT AS REALLY JUST YOU KNOW IT LIKE INBEDDED THIS IN MY MIND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH TRAMA IS TO GET RIGHT UP NEXT TO THAT TRAMA TO THE POINT WHERE SOME RELIEF AS EXPERIENCED THERE IS NO OTHER REAL WAY AM AS SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE CLASSIC PSYCADELICS MAY OFFER THE THE AM WITH A VERY STRONG NUDGE PERHAPS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO THA THE UNCOMFORTABLE IN A WAY THAT I'M EMPTY A MAYOR SOME NONCLASSICAL PSYCHODELICS A PERHAPS TO NAT  RETON MUT TIME FRAMES IR OR DURATION OF TRIPS AND THESE DIFFERENT C OMPOUNDS AND HOW THEY DEFFER N HOW THE'RE SIMILAR A AND LEFEDO EDUCATE ME ON D M T AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING WITH D M T A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S A VERY BRIEF TRIP A MINUTES A PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAVE DONE THIS AGAIN TO THERAPUTICALLY A HY A I'LL JUST POINT TO ONE VERY EXCITING I THINK AM GROUP AND INITIATIVE WHICH IS THE VETERAN SOLUTIONS INITIATIVE WHICH IS A GROUP A THIS IS CARRIED OUT IN MEXICO BUT IN CONJUNCTION WITH LABORATORIES AT STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE WHO ARE VALUATING THE NURL CHANGES IM IN THIS INVOLVES I BEGAIN WHICH IS YOU BOGO WHICH IS A VERY LONG DURATIONS LIKE ADELIC TWENTY TWO HOURS OR MORE FOLLOWED BY A I THINK ONE OR TWO DOSES OF D M T THIS IS FOR VETERANS WITH O TO DEAL WITH ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES A APPEARS TO BE WORKING WITH GREAT SUCCESS AND OUVE SPOKEN TO SEVERAL OF PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS AND THE WAY THAT THEY DESCRIBED D M T ALMOST AT ACROSS THE BOARD WAS QUOTE HERE I'M JUST PULLING QUOTES RIGT ANIC DATA A THE MOST PROFOUND EXPERIENCE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE EVEN GREATER THAN THE BIRTH OF MY CHILDREN QUOTE LIKE BEING ATTACHED TO THE SHOCK WAVE OF AN ADAM BALM QUOTE THERE'S NO WAY IM WOULD DO ANOTHER DOSE BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE WAS SO UNBELIEVABLE INTERESTING BY THE WAY I THINK MOST OF US INCLUDING ME WOUD THINK WHY WOULN'T YOU WANT TO DO IT AGAIN THEN BUT THIS IDEA THAT THAT WAS JUST B ONE ANYTHING SO THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT MSCUSE ME THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT STATEMENTS COMING FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXISTED AT THE EXTREMES OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE TO BEGIN WITH WRITE THESE ARE I SO CLE TEER ONE OPERATORS WITH SPECIAL OPERATIONS O EXIT AND MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE TRAMA BUT D M T SOUNDS LIKE A BIG DEAL  A SHORT DURATION REALLY BIG DEAL WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT ITS CHEMISTRY WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW IT'S IMPACTING BRAIN NET WORKS AND WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON THAT PEOPLE ARE DESCRIBING IT AS AH THE WAYS I JUST MENTION AY MOMENTS AGOR YET IT  IT'S A ROCKETSHIP IT FAH IF THE SALASIBON IS LIKES SHIP LEAVING PORT THAN YA THIS IS THIS IS A ROCKETSHIP IN TO CRAZINESS IS AND BY THE IS IT CERETON INTO A IT IS YES IT IS A CLASSIC PSYCHODELICATES O DIRECT AGONISTS O DIRECT STIMULATOR OF THE CERETONE IN TO A RECEPTOR ITSI AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LESS POETENTHAN SALASIBIN BUT POTENCIES OF FUNNY THING BECAUS DOSE DEPENDENT SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE EMPTY IS LESS THAN THAT OF SALACIBENIS JUST THAT YOU GIVE MORE OF THE DRUG AN AH BUT A IT HAS THAT'S MATCHED BY ITS ITS STICKINESS FOR THE CERETON INTO A RECEPTOR WHICH IS THIS KIND OF GOLDEN RULIN IN PSYCHADELIC SCIENCE IS THAT IT WAS DISCOVERED IN MIDNINETEEN EIGHTY IS THIS TYPE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AFFINITY OF THE STICKINES OR THE BINDING POTENTIAL OF THE PSYCHODELIC FOR THE TWO A RECEPTOR IN PARTICULAR CERETONIN TO  AND ITS POTENCY AND HA STICKY OF THE DRUG THAN MORE POTENTS ALASTEEREAY STICKING VERY VERY POTENT YOU ONLY NEED THOSE TINY MICROGRAM DOSES SO THE EMPTY BY ITS AFFINITY IS IS AN A LITTLE LESS POTENT BUT BY ITS EFFECTS WHEN YOU GIVE A STANDED DOSE ITS JUST IN INIT'S JUST WILD AND T EMPTY BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER COMPOUND CAL FIVE METHOXY DE EMPTY WHICH IS A BIT DIFFERENT PHARMOCLOGICALLY AND SUBJECTIVELY TS IT SIMILAR IN TERMS OF ITS CANATICS IT'S ANOTHER ROCKETSHIP AN BOTH COMPOUNDS AN IN THE WILD SOTO SPEAK AH AN SMOKED OFTENTY EMPTY AND FIVE EMIO PEOPLE OF VAPING BOTH ACTUALLY NOW AN THERE ARE V TA PENCE EN O BEING THAT DEVELOPED A TE PEOPLE TO ADMINISTER ADMINISTER TIS BET MORE TRADITION ITS BEING A SMOKING THING THIS IS CLINICALLY NOT RECREATIONALLY WE'RE BOTH BOTH NOW YOUNG ING EN A UNDERGROUND PRACTITION AS A USING THE VAT PENS THEY LIKE THEM BECAUSE PEOPLE TIG TRATE THE DISAGE THEY GET A FEEL FOR WHAT IT IS TO BE GOING INTO THIS STATES SO THAT THEY FEEL I CAN LET GO AND GO INTO IT BUT SAM AND IT YOU I THINK SOME OF THE VETERAN'S WORK MIGHT BE GIVING FIVE EMII AFTER THE I BEGAN AN A PHENOMENOLOGICALLY A IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TY ANTY AND FIVE EMII PEOPLE MIGHT PUT IT ON FITHEN E I'VE BEEN MORE OF A RELIABLE EGER DISSOLUTION EXPERIENCE LESS VISUAL AND MORE KIND OF ALL ROUND IMMAHIAN IN THE GREATA WHOLE LOSS OF SELF IDENTITY AND JUST IN MASSION AN EVERYTHING IGYE  MEWE JUST TALK ABOUT EGO DISSOLUTION FOR SECOND IONS SUCH A STICKY A A INTERESTING IDEA I CAN TAKE A STEP BACK AS A NUR SCIENTIST AND IAND SAY I GAN EGO DISSOLUTION THIS IDEA THAT THE THAT YOU KNOW'T FROM A VERY EARLY AGE WE HAVE THE CONCEPT OF SELF AND THAT IN I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND I KNOW I ME AND NOT SOMEBODY ELSE AND SOMLY YOU DO THE SAME AND MOST MOST PEOPLE DO THE SAME I WOULD HOPE BUT THAT AND THAT THERARE OBJECTS IN THE WORLD AND PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BEYOND US BUT EVERY TIME WE HEARE ABOUT EGO DISSOLUTION IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A A KIND OF A TEMPORARY A ELIMINATION OF THE OF THE IDEA THAT THINGS STOP AND AM START AND STOP BETWEEN US AND EVERYTHING ELSE ALMOST LIKE YOU KNOWING THAT CAND OF A YERE AR NOT TRYG TO SOUND PHILOSOPHICAL OR A METAPHYSICAL BUT THE OTHER SORT OF THE MOLECULAR CONTINUITY OF OF LIFE RIGHT FOR ALL ALL YEST LITTLE LITTLE BITS OFISRY  I I'M NOT A FUNCTIONAL WAY TO GO THROUGH THE DAY RIGHT BECAUE YOU WANT TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET LOST IN THAT IF YOURE GOAL IS TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE BUT AM BUT YOU DONT WHAT IS THE THE WHAT IS THE POWER OF EGO DISSOLUTION IS IT THE IDEA THAT WE BOLT THAT WE LIKE BELONG IS IT A SENSE OF MEANING IS IT THE SENSE THAT WE WE'RE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS WE THINK WHICH OF COURSE COULD BE WONDERFULLY USEFUL A WAY TO GO THROUGH LIFE YOU KNOW TO TO THINK OF WE'RE NOT AS AN AS 'T LIKE WE WE ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY THING RIGHT BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE CONNECTION IS VITAL AS MOST PEOPLE DO WHAT IS EGO DISSOLUTION AND WHY WOULD THIS SERETONEIN TO A ACTIVATION COSAT THAT'S REMARKABLE YER GREAT QUESTIONS AVING W WHAT IS IT A YOU ALLUDED TO IT WITH A START STOP I THINK YOU NI BECAUSE YOU COULD DEFINE IT BAY BOUNDARYS IN A SENSE WHAT IT WHAT ISN'T ME IT IS AS VALID HERE IS IS THE YOU KNOW A DEVELOPING SENSE OF WHAT IS ME THAT A CHILD DEVELOPS AT WHATEVER AGE AM AND A SO A MAJOR CHARACTERISTIC OF THE EGO DISSOLUTION EXPERIENCE RATHER JUST A NEGATIVE A THING GOING AWAY MY SENSE OF SELF GOING AWAY IS IS THE POSITIVE O NOW I FEEL INTO CONNECTED WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WHE WORLD AT LARGE AND I REALIZE YOU KNOWTHER THERE IS THAT MOLECULAR CONTINUITY AN ACTUALLY THAT'S A GRAND TRUTH AND OH MAYBE THE EAGE THING IS SOMEWHAT ITLUSARY OR AT LEAST A CONSTRUCTION OF MY MIND AND INDEED IT IS RITE WELL IT INOUS YE MIN IS NO TRTRANSCENDENTALISM ABOUT THAT IT'S JUST LIKE LOGIC I THINK ABOUT ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT LIKE FAMILY M AN WE ALL KNOW WHAT IMMEDIATE FAMILY IS BUT YOU KNOW SO F LIKE OM FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING MYSELF I DO IT ALL THE TIME ANYWAY UM WHEN I TEACH NEANATOMY YOU KNOW SOME CLEVER STUDENT ALWAYS FIGURES OUT OCABLE THAT'S CONNECTED TO THAT AND THAT'S CONNECT BUT ULTIMATELY EVERYTHING IN THE BRAIN IS CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING ELSE YE THERE'S JUST NO WAY AROUND THAT THAT'S A TRUE STATEMENT YE AND SO YOU REALLY JUST HAVE TO DECIDE WHERE YOU DRAW THE BOUNDARY  BETWEEN WEN YOU DRALLY A I WHERE WET WHERE ARE THE MODUALS WHAT ARE THE MODER YOU COAN SAY THE BRAIN IS JUST ONE BIG MACKROM ARGU E AND THEN YOU ALSO ONT INCLUDE THE BODY AND NOW FORTUNATELY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO EMBRACE THIS IDEA THAT IT'S NOT MIND BODY IT'S BOTH BECAUE YOUR NERVOUS YSTEM EXTENDS THROUGH BOTH OF COURSE SO AS AT THE SAME CON BE SAID OF FAMILY LIKE WE'RE RELATED RIGHT NOT JUST BY VIRTUE HE FACT THE WERE HUMAN BEINGS IF WE DID ARE GENIALOGICAL CHARTS WE WOULD FIND A A CONVERGENE AT IS ON POINT E UM AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THIS BECOMES A BIT OF A GAME BUT THEN ONE REALIZES THAT WHERE YOU DRAW THE BOUNDARIES AND IF YOU DRAW THEM AT BROTHERS SISTER PARENTS BYOLOGICAL PARENTS AT CETERA THAT'S A GAME TO AND SO IT IS JUST A CONSTRUCT Y MIN IT IS A PHONGAM YOU NI WER YOU DRA THE LINE WHEN TO PASS I WEN TO COLLAPSE IT'S A SUTA CLASSIC CONSIDERATION IN SINCSE WHEN TO PASS  HOWO LONG PERVERSES LETTER ELY YE IT'S THE JUSTIS QUESTION I WELL WHY TO PSYCHODELICS DO IT AND DA THER WE THINK PSYCHODELICS DO IT BECAUSE THE TOGIC RECEPTIS AT LEAST EEN A CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS DO IT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT DISTRESS  EMPTE MAY DOESN'T REALLY DO IT IN THE SAME WAY MY SULTONLY GA IT BU YEI ABATES AB MY EXPERIENCE WITH AM EMPDY AMAY IS THAT IT'S SUCH A STRONG IN PATHAGEN YE U AND AND THAT IT CAN DIE CAUSE EMPATHY FOR OTHERS YE CERTAINLY YOU COULD IMAGINE SITUATIONS WHERE ONE AT IN EMPYAMAJOURNEY A ND AFTERWARDS SAYS YOU KNOW O THESE THESE MY OPPRESSORS  YOU ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HARM ME THEY AH AND HERE I'M NOT REFERRING TO MY EXPERIENCE BUT YOU KNOW THEY DID THE BEST WITH WHAT THEY HAVE I SHOULD HAVE EMPATHY FOR THEM FORGIVENESS BUT ALSO FOR ONESELF THAT THERE'S AN IN A EMPATHY FOR SELF I KNOW I SAID THIS EARLIER THAT IS VERY HARD FOR MOST PEOPLE TO ACCESS PERHAPIS NOT THE NURSESIS OUT THERE LISTENING THEY'LL BE LIKE OF COURSE EMPATHY FOR SELF BUT EVERY ONE ELSE I THINK AM A ALL THE OTHER HEALTHY PEOPLE AM OR THE HEALTHY PEOPLE OTHER THAN NURSES AND NOT PICKING ON NURSES I HAVE TO IMAGINE THEY SUFFER TO IN FACT I THINK THAT'S THE ROUT OF THEIR NURSISISM AM THAT EMPATHY FOR SELF IS NOT SOMETHING THAT COMES REFLECIVELY FOR MOST PEOPLE AND THE HERE I'M NOTI OUT SELF LOVE OR SELF RESPECT BUT THIS NOTION OF BEING ABLE TO SEE THE SELF AS AM NOT JUST DESERVING OF LOVE AND CARE BUT ACTUALLY HOLDING THAT IN PLACE WHILE IN CONFRONTATION WITH SOMETHING CHALLENGING IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS MORE NOT LESS ACCESS TO ADAPT IVE RESPONSE AS TO THAT CHALLENGE I THINK THAT'S THE WAY I I CANOT CONCEPTIONALIZE IT YE YE BUTI ME DRUGS OFFER OF A GRAT THEY OFFER GREAT  AH GREAT SCIENTITIC TOOLS FOR ATACTING THIS QUESTION WHAT IS EGE DISLATION AND WHY DO DRUGS MUCH INATES IT A WHANT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THE BRAIN YOU NI BECAUSE OTHER DRUGS LIKE COCANE REALY SING MORE OF E A DIFFERENT EURI TRANSMIT SI A DYPEMAINE MORE THAN SERETIN AND THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE WITH EMDY MAY IT'S MORE PINICOIN FLATEER IO ABSOLULY  PE WILL BECOME HYPERLINEAR HYPER AM LINKED TO THEIR OWN DESIRES AND WISHES AND FUTURE OUTCOMES BECOME AN OBSESSION IT'S THE STUFF OF A KIND OF AMERICAN PCYCHO AND THE A KIND OF A CLECHAS AND STEREOTYPES OF THE THE THE ADIES A A COGAN CULTURE YE YE WE DID TA STUDY ONE SAT LOOKING AT DIDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP WITH EGO INFLATION ON ONE AXIS AND EGO DISSOLUTION ON THE OTHER AND SARDET IT JUST MASSIVELY PASSED OR DIFFERENCIATED BETWEEN COKANE AND AND THE PSYCODELICS ASS CUANAT STUDY SO COKANE MAKES PEOPLE'S EGOS SUPERINFLADER YEAND SOT ANIT USH DISSOLUTION AND THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE WITH A WIT PSYCODELIC I ISN'E NO IMAGING TO TO EXPLAIN OUR COKINE DOES THAT THAT WOULD BE A GREAT STUDY YER GRAT I WISO AA AS ABAUT A COMING OT A GAT WELL ELSOS ABOUT ICCAL COMING AR YOU  ON G A SHOP IN YOUR LAB YHAS A READY GOT ON IF IT'S RIGHT TO FINISH TH THREAD ON ON WHY PSYCHODELICS AND EGO DISSOLUTION WE DO NOT SOME THINGS OR YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME HYPOTHESEAS AN IT'S THE THE TARGIT RECEPTORS A CERETORN INTO A RECEPTOR  THE CLASIC PSYCODELICS HIT I HEAVILY EXPRESSED IN WHAT THESE DAYS I LIKE TO CALL RECENT BRAIN BECAUSE EVOLUTIONARILY IT'S RECENT BRAIN IT'S CARTEX THAT HUMANS HAVE MORE THAN ANY OTHER SPECIES IF YOU LOOK AT A MAPPING OF CORTICAL EXPANSION FROM SAME MACAC OR CHIM TO HUMAN IT'S THE VERY SAME MAP THAT YOU'LL FIND THE TWO A RECEPTORS IN AN SO THAT'S THE TARGET IT'S AND AND YET IT'S JUST EASY TO THINK THAT OWELL THAT COULD BE THE EGOIC BRAIN YOU KNOW AND THERE AND THE CLASSIC PSYCDELICS COME IN TE KIND OF THEY SCRAMBLE UP THE ACTIVITY THAT'S THE INTROPIC BRAIN ACTION AND IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE START STOP THE BOUNDARIES AN THAT IN TROPIC ACTION SO AV SPREADS OUT THE SYSTEM AND IT DOESN'T SHUT IT OFF IT SO AV SPREADS IT OUT YOU KNOW AN DISSOLUTION YR AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU WULD TALKING ABOUT HEADSPACE AS WELL SO THAT FITS IF IT'S YOU KNOW IF IT'S MORE CAPACIOUS SIR ITS SORT OF FITS AN THE BIG QUALIFIER WITH PSYCO THE LECTARAPY THAT THE PEOPLE RIGHTLY BRING UP IS IT DOESN'T LAST A'S THE PARADOX OF IT THE PARADOX OF EGO DISSOLUTION TO THAT EGO MIGHT GO AWAY DURING THE TRIP AND YOU HAVE THESE PROFOUND INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MOLECULAR CONTINUITY AND HOW WE'RE ALL WORN AND INTERCONNECTED AND THEN YOU COME DOWN AND HOWEVER LONG LATER YOU KNOW THE EGO COMES BACK BUT MAYBE WITH A VENGEANCE AND SADLY YOUND I THINGS CAN GO ARIG WHEN PEOPLE HAVEN'T DONE THE WORK PEHAPS HAVEN'T DONE THE INTECRATION WORK AND MAY BE EGO DEFENCES COME BACK AND  AND I AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A PRETTY PICTURE I HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE THAT IN THE TRIAL SAID YOUDO WHAT PERCENTAGE YOUA ER THE OUT OF PEOPLE COMING THROUGH WDO YOU THINK IT END UP WITH ALL WORSE THAN THEY THEY WERE BEFORE ATE THE TRIAL IT'S VERY RARE IN THE TRIALS THAT WE'VE DONE AND YE BUT YOU SEE DEFENCES COME BACK SAY YOU YOU DO SEE PEOPLE RELAPSE THAT'S MORE UN A FEW FEW PUSHING OUT TOLIKE THREE MONTHS PLASS IN SOMETHING LIKE TREATMENT RESISTANT DOPPRESSION THAT'S MORE THE RULE THAN THE EXCEPTION SADLY PEOPLE RELAPSE IF THEIR HISTORIES I YOU KNOW HISTORYIS OF CHRONIC DEPRESSION THEN WHILE YOU MIGHT GIVE THEM A A WINDOW OF WELLNESS IT'S SADLY T DOESN'T LAST AS NOT TO SAY THAT IT DOESN'T EVERLAST IT DOES AND AND WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OUR FIRST TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPPRESSION TRY WHO ARE WELL TO MY KNOWLEDGE TO DAY BACK AT WORK IN FANTASTICALLY WELL AND BUT SADLY THE MAJORITY HAVE HAVE RELAPSED TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND NEED TO DO MORSE SICOND O JOURNES WELL THEY CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL THAT'S BEING THE REALLY DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT WE'VE BEEN UP AGAINST IS THAT WE DO A TRIAL WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN IS SKETCH OF ONE DRUG BECOMES A MEDICINE IN THE TRIAL OR AT LEAST AN EXPR R MENTAL MEDICINE WE GIVE THE TREATMENT IT WORKS FANTASTICALLY WELL GIVES PEOPLE A REMISSION THAT THEY'VE NEVER READY HAD A THE HOWEVER LONG AND AND THEN DETROLENS IN THAT DENYED THAT TREATMENT AND WORSE STILL IF THEY WOULD T HAVE THAT TREATMENT THEY WOULD BE COMMITCING A CRIME IT'S SORT OF A SICK JOK IN AWAY BUT THAT'S HAT'S THE SITUATION THAT WE'VE BEEN AND THAT'S A PERFECT SEGWAY FOR WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AM NOW WHICH IS WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE OF LEGALITY IN TERPS HAT WERE THE PROGRESSION TOWARDS LEGALITY I'D ALSO LIKE TO TOUCH ON THE RULE OF INLESS JUST A INCOMING BIG FARMER THE'RE LOT OF START UP COMPANIES NOW TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE DISCOVERIES THAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE MADE AM YOU THE LANDSCAPE OUT THERE IS VERY UNCLEAR TO ME AM MAYBE I'LL JUST A CALL OUT SOME SILOS AS I SEE THEM AND MAYBE WE CAN DRAW SOME AM BRIDGES BETWEEN THEM IF THEY EXIST AT THE GROUND LEVEL NOT THE GRASS RUTES BUT AT THE GROUND LEVEL I LOOK TO LABORATORIES LIKE YOURS MATTHEW JOHNSONS ROLLING GRIFFITHS I'M SOME LABORATORIES AT STAMFORD A NOIN WILLIAMS A LABORATORIES DOING STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF PSYCHODELICS INHUMAN BEINGS O NOT ANIMAL MODELS IN TERMS OF THEIR CLINICAL APPLICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION IN EREXIA I NOW KNO FIVORO MY ALL JA TRAMA LET'S LUMP EMPDY A MA AN THEREAS WELL I'M ASSUMING THAT IT AL WORKS IN EQUIVALENT WAY AT THE LEVEL OF KIND OF WARE THE LEGISLATURES TAKING THINGS O CASE O LABS USING GOVERNMENT MONEY PHILANTHROPY ET CETERA THEN THERERE THE AM THEY SORT OF THE THERAPISTS OUT THERE THAT ARE ACCESSING WHAT WE BELIEVE ORE CLEAN SOURCES OF EMDIAMAY SYLICIBE AND ELIST TO DO THIS THER ARE DUING IT ILLEGALLY THIS IS IN THE UESS OR A OTHER A WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES CAUSE OBVIOUSLY S GEN A DIFFER BY COUNTRY IM WHO ARE ADMINISTERING THESE THINGS SORT OF ON THE BASIS OF WHAT THEY'RE READING IN THESE STUDIES THAT YOU ALL ARE PUBLISHING BUT ALSO EXPANDING ON AN EXPERIMENTING HIPPY FLIPS AND COMMINATION DRUGS AND CATAMENE AND ET CETERA BE LET'S LEY' CEN AMEN OUT FROM IT RAN OW BECAUSE IT'S LEGAL BUT THERE'S THAT THEN THERE'S THE I'M I DON'T N'T SAY ITS OR RECREATIONAL SLASH OPEN MARKET BLACK MARKET AND HERE I WANT A A RAISE A FLAG TO THE FACT THAT A A DOCTOR PETER TA DID A TERRIFIC PODCAST ON THIS RECENTLY IN HIS OWN PODCAST THE DRIVE THE FACT THAT O FENTINEL LACING WITH VENTINELS NOW SHOWING UP IN M D MAY AND PSYCHODELEC CETER PURCHASED ON THE STREETS OF SERIOUS CAUTION TO THOSE GETTING IT FROM UNCERTAIN SOURCES AND AND THEN YOU'VE GOT FARMA AND THEN AS AN UMBRELLA FOR ALL OF THIS YOU'VE GOT THE FTY A AND LAWN FORCEMAN AGENCIES WHICH CURRENTLY SAY THIS STUFF IS ILLEGAL UNLESS IT'S BEENG USED IN A CLINICAL TRIAL SELLING IN OR POSSESSING IT CAN GET YOU CHARGED WITH A CRIME RANGING FROM I DON'T WANT TO SAY CAUSE I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M UP TO FELANIES RIGHT YEARS IN PRISON OSO CAN'T TAKE IT THROUGH OUR PORITS CAN'T DON'T GET CAUGHT WITH IT DON'T BUY IT DON'T SELL IT KIND OF THING SO WHERE ARE WE GOING FROM THAT PICTURE OF THE SILOS I KNOW THINGS ARE IN CLINICAL TRIALS NOW MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF A'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITHOUT THE IFFERENT PHASES RELATE TO THE PROXIMITY TO LEGALITY CULD YOU JUST CONE GIVE US THE LANDSCAPE AND TOUCH ON HOW LONG YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEFORE THE PEOPLE THAT COME THROUGH YOUR TRIALS COULD THEN GO GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR CILISIVON OR POTENTIALLY BUY IT WITHOUT THE RISK AFROM A RELIABLE SOURCE ONE WOULD HOPE BUT WITHOUT THE RISK OF GETTING THROWN IN JAIL I'M I USED TO LIVE IN OAKLAN CALIFORNIA MY UNDERSTANDING AND PLEASE CRET ME IF I'M WRONG FOLKS DON'T TRUST THIS AND TR RMATION IN GETTIN TROUBLE MAN ISHINDING IS THAT SILLICIDEAN IS IT DECRIMINALISED IN OGLAND BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS BEING LEGAL SO WET IS GOING ON OUT THERE  WE WAS SO MARCH JUAS THAS FIFTY FIVE QAD BY THE AM BUT FEEL FREE TO BEINSEUST O SUBSIDEOF ON IF WELL OKLANS OF FUNNY ONE II LIVE CLOSE TO OKLAND THERAR HEADSHOPS IN OKLAN AM OU KNO AM THE MIGHT BE SELLING CANNABIS AN AND YOU NOW CANNOBIS RELATED PARAPHENELIA THE DE SELLING MUSHROOMS AS WELL SILLICIDE IN MUSHROOM O E FAIR OPEN YE THAT'S A FACT I DON I CAN VERIFY TAT IHONT PROCIOUS THEM BUT I'VE GONE IN AND CAN'T CHECTED OUT WITH WHAT WHAT'S GOINE ON HERE YE YER YES A YOU KNA A THE POLICE AREN'T GOING TO PRIORATIYES AM THAT ACTIVITY THE PURCHASING OF OF THOSE MUSHROOMS AS A CRIME NOW IN OKLAN BECAUSE OF THE DECRIMINALIZATION SAY THOSE HEADSHOPS SHOULDN'T STRICTLY BE SELLING WHILE THEY SHOULDN'T BE SELLING AM THEY WON'T HAVE A LICENSE TO BE SELLING LICENSES DON'T EXIST A YET FOR THAT HERE AM BUT A LET'S SEE WHETHER THEY GET SHUT DOWN THEY PROBABLY WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT THERE'S A TES A CHURCH YOU KNOW IN I OKLAN THAT A SAID  AM SAY THAT  THAT THE SELLING IN ITS PART OF SO RELIGIOUS RIGHTS THA THEY USING THAT CHURCH MODEL IS SI LUPOLL AM A YOU KNOW THE WAY THE NATIVE AMERICANS CAN USE PE OTE AND THEY HAVE MORE GENUINE AM A CASE BECAUSE THERE IS A HISTORY THERE AM WITH A TRONIC IN  TIC E BACK ON THAT ANYWAY THAT'S THAT'S SO OF YOU KNOW CLOSE TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW BUT AM FEDERALLY WHICH IS REALLY THE MAJOR INFLLECTION POINT IS THE EFTIE AM AN THE LICENT SEEING OF PSYCHADELICS AS MEDICINES TO BE LEGALLY PRESCRIBED ACROSS THE COUNTRY CROSS THE UASSEN BEYOND AND THAT IS CLOSE BECAUSE THE KEY AD PHAS SAR THERE ARE DIFFERENT PHASES OF CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE KEY ONE TO KNOW ABOUT HIS FACE THREE A PASE THREE TRIALS A LICENSING TRIALS IF THAT SUCCESSFUL AND TYPICALLY AVE TO DO AT LEAST TWO SUCCESSFUL ONES SHOW THE RESULTS TO THE REGULATORS WHO ARE THE EFT A THE MEDICINE REGULATORS AND SAY IS THIS GOOD ENOUGH NOW FOR YOU TO GIVE ME A LICENSE SO THAT I CAN SELL ND AND PROVIDE THIS MEDICINE THAT WE'VE DEMONSTRATED AS A MEDICINE AN SO THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE WITH EMDYA MATHERAPEE FOR POSHOMATS IT STRESS TI SORD OF MAPS HAVE LED THAT WORK AND DONE TO FACE THREE TRIALS I THINK THEY'VE ALREADY PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT THE SECOND TRIAL HAD RESULTS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST WE KNOW THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST BECAUSE THEYRE PUBLISHED AND THEY WERE REMARKABLY GOOD SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT REMISSIONRATES IN A LONG TERM INISHAMME AS SOME OF THOSE REMISSIONRATES FOR TRAMA WERE YEURS YAT IS DIFFERENT THEN WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING FOR SOCIVEN WERE PEOPLE MIGHT NEED ON GOING RSING THAT'S TRUE YE YE BUT OF COURSE JUST PHRATRAMA IN THOSE TRIALS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THOSE AND M YOU MAY TRIALS WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON DEPRESSION YES YES POCESTONE ON THETROMA AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT DATSER IS BEING FALLED NOW TO MY KNOWLEDGE LIKE AS WE SPEAK AND AND THERE ANTICIPATING A DECISION MAYBE THIS YEAR AND WITH ROLL OUT HAPPENING AS EARLY AS NEXT YEAR MEN THAT SORT OF BEST CASE I THINK COULD ASK YOU WHEN YOU SAY ROLL OUT WHOSE RAN ITS THE APPROPRIATE A TERM FOR MDIAMA  HA AT SO CALLED ROLLING AN ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF MY AUDIENCE MAYBE FIFTY ONT WILL UNDERSTAND THAT AND NOT FUNNY JOKE THAT I M MADE AM WHO'S GOING TO ROLL IT OUT IS THIS WHERE WOULD ONE GET THE EMPDY IT THAT THE CLEAN SOURCE OF ENDE AMA MEANING NOT LACE WITH VENTAN ALL NOT LACE WITH MATAM FETAMEAN AM NOT UNDERGONE ANY CHEMICAL CONVERSION TO SOME OTHER DRUG WHICH CAN HAPPEN WHICH EXTENDED SHELFUR LIFE ET CETERA THERE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GO TO THEIR PSYCHIATRICE TO GET EMDY AMAY AND WHO'S GOING TO BE PROVIDING IT IS AT GO BE SOME BIG MAJOR FARMER A THIS SEEMS LIKE A SERIOUS SET OF ISSUES IT IS AND I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS I DO NEITHER MAPS WOULD BE PROVIDING THE COSTAVE DONE THE WORK AND THEY HAVE SET THEMSELVES UP IN A SENSE TO POTENSIALLY BECOME THE PROVIDE A AM WHETHER IS A FARMAR COMPANY WHICH IS THE BIG QUESTION AT WRESTLING WITH THE MOYMEN IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO BECOME THE FAMER COMPANY AND THAT THEY PROBABLY DESERVE TO MAKE THE CHOICE BECAUSE THEY PUT IN SO MANY YEARS OF HARD WORK WHEN ALL OF THI STUFF WAS CONSIDERED LIKE RAVER CULTURE PARTY DRUG THEY WERE THE ONES THAT SPOTTED THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL THEY WE KNEW THERE WAS THER REPEUTE A POTENTIAL BAY ON WORK GOING BACK MEN HE DECADES BUT AM POINTS TO THEM AND I THINK THAT I THINK IN MY OPINION THEY SHOULD HAVE THE AGENCY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS YER IIT'S A REMARK SUCH A REMARKABLE THING THAT'S BEING ACHIEVED AND I I THINK THEY'VE DONE IT ALL ON FO PHILANTHROPIC DINATIONS AM I THINK I AM YES I AM THERE THERE IS THE AI QUESTION MARK IN THE AFTIE A ROS O ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT AM TO TO YOUR QUESTIONN I HE WHO CAN PROVIDE THIS BECAUSE IN THE FACE THREE WORK AND OP UNTIL THIS POINT HAS BEEN A MAP'S TRAINING A MAPSTER OF HIS TRAINING AND YOU HAVE TO DO THIS FORMAL A TRAINING AM IN ORDER TO TO BE A PRACTICION WITHIN THE TRIALS BUT NOW THERE'S A QUESTION FROM THE FD A WHETHER THAT MAP'S TRAINING CAN BE THE TRAINING THAT A CLINITION HAS TO HAVE TO NOW BE A PROVIDER AND WHEN I SAY ROLL OUT IS LIKE AND OFFERING THIS IS A SERVICE ESSENTIALLY AND SO WERE WITD THE REFER OR COME FROM THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION THAT I'M NOT HUNDRED PER SENT ON THE ANSWER WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM A PSYCHOLOTRIST OR WHETHER SOME ONES AN TO THE GENERAL PHYSICION COULD DO THAT REFERAL BUT THEY WILL BE GOING TO A PROVIDER WHO IS LICENSE AND CERTIFIED AND WILL HAVE DONE SOME TRAINING AND THERE WILL BE A CONSENSI SON IN A WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ENOUGH TRAINING TO PROVIDE THERE WILL ALSO BE SOME STIPULATIONS ON THE BASIC UNDERLYINE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE CLINITION WHO PROVIDES SO I IMAGINE THEY'LL HAVE TO BE A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TO NECESARY BE A PSYCHATRIST THER COULD BE A THINK A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR ALL THE DISINGS I THINK WITHOUT QUESTION THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A PHYSICIAN PRESENT OR AT LEAST WITHIN READY ACCESS IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY YESPECIALLY WITH THEM TE A MA BECAUSE OF THE ARE PROPENSITY FOR CARRIAC ISSUSLYA BECAUSE OF THE ENFERIMENT PRIVATIES IN WHAT WEARIES UNSOICIDE AND IN TERMS OF THE THESE TRIALS IS IT IN FASE TWO FASE THREE IT'S IN FASE THREE AND THERE'S SOLICIBEN TERIPY WORK BEING DONE FOR TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION BY A COMPANY CALL COMPASS A THOSE TRIALS AD WHICH ARE ALWAYS MULTI SIHT SO THERE'S ALWAYS A BUNCH OF TEAMS OR LABS IN A SENSE AND GEOGRAPHICALLY SPREAD OUT THETARE EACH CONTRIBUTING TO DATE O THA THEN GETS MASS TOGETHER AND IS THEN SUBMITTED AS PART OF THE FACE THREE TRIL RESULTS SO THAT'S HAPPENING WITH COMPASS RIGHT NOW IS SALISIVE INTERREPYFOR TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION THOSE TRILS AV JUST STARTED AND AM I THINK THE EARLIEST ESTIMATE THAT I HEARD IN ER IN A JOURNALISTIC ARTICLE WAS BECAUSE I DON'T INCOMPASS WOULD SAY OR THEY WOULDN'T SAY PUBLICLY SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY TWENTY SIX ANLY SIX  WHAT WHILE SO EMDYAMA ASAS A HEAD OF SOE YET'S QUITE A FEW YEARS AT HEAD AND IT'S MORE OF E NOT A CERTAINTY BUT IT'S VERY VERY STRONG POSITION WITH EMDR MAY WHERE IS THE WORKS ONLY JUST BEGUN WITH WITH SALISIDEN IN TUMS OF THE FACE THREE TRIALS BUT THEN YOU HAVE THIS OTHER SITUATION OF LIKE HOWEVER MANY PSYCHODELIC RESECHENTAS THERE ARE NOW ACROSS THE GLOBE AM IT WASN'T NICE TO AN I WE HAD THE FIRST ONE IN LONDON IN TWENTY NINETEEN FIRST ONE IN TWENTY NINETEEN IS TWENTY TWENTY THREE NOW AND I DON'T KNOHOW MANY THERE RE BUT I SO MUCH AS HAPPENED IN SUCH A SMALL SPACE OF TIME AM YES BUT SIR YOU KNOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT INDICATIONS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TELL YOU ABOUT AN EREXIER AND FIBRAY MILE JUST IN TEROME TRONA DO A THE TROAL AW WITH A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AND YOU SEE A SERF IN MATAM PHETAMIN USTICEORDER HE'S GOT A TROL GOING ON IN PARKINSONS DOSEASE SIR AND CHRONICLAW BACK PAIN AND BY POLA DISORDER I MEAN A SO MUCH GOING ON I SEE D ALMOST THE FULL GAMMER TOF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AM NOT SCITOPHRENIA TO MY KNOWLEDGE AM A BEING LOOKED AT SO THERE'S SO MUCH GRAND GRAND YOU A GROUND SWELL OF ACTIVITY AM AND I THINK THESE SMALL INVESTIGATE TO LED STUDIES TYPICALLY THER SMALL BECAUSE TRIALS ARE EXPENSIVE AM I'RE GOING TO BE REPORT IN POSSITIVE RESULTS I KNOW WERE WIRSING AND IT WILL BE YO KNOW FOR A SEE NOW TLEAST FOUR TRIALS ALL WITH REALLY POSITIVE RESOLVES IN VERY DIFFICULT TO TREAT DISORDERS AND THAT'S JUST US AND I KNEITHER PSY MUCH ELSE WHERE A DICTION DISORDERS AS WELL AND I MIGHT JOHNSONS WERL COVIOUSLY AM MICHAEL BUGAN SHEETS SO ALL THIS COMPELLING GROUNCS WELL IT'S REALLY SOMETHING AND YET YOU NAT THE SYSTEM TO REALLY MAKE A BIG BREAK THROUGH AND SIMES A LICENSING IS OF COURSE SLI AND ITS  NOT CONFRUSTRATE PEOPLE BUT IT IT HAS TE T ASK ME DONT PROPLY AM HOW ELSE WE WE REVERT BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SEVENTIES WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF INTEREST IN PSYCHODELICS IT'S COME INTERESTING TO ME THERE WAS A A CLOSE JUCK SUPPOSITION OF MEDITATION AND A COUNT OF BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES TO A SELF DIRECTED STATE CHANGE AND PSYCHODELICS MEDITATION CAN AVE MADE IT THROUGH THE HATCH MN THEYE WERE THE SOME YEARS WHERE IT WAS CONSIDERED KIND OF COUNTRICULTURE WO MAGIC CARPET WEIRD O STUFF BY WESTERN SCIENCE UM BUT NOW IMIN THEIR TENS OF THE PROTENS OF THOUSANDS IS NOT AN OVERSTATEMENT OF QUALITY STUDIES EXPLORING HOW MEDITATION CAN PROVIDE ADVANTAGES FOR THE MIND AND EVEN FOR MENTAL HEALTH AM AND PSYCHODELICS AR NOW CATCHING UP BUT THEY USED TO BE CLOSE COUSINS IN THE IN THE A CULTURAL FRAMEWORK UM BUT THE PROBLEM WAS I THINK PSYCHODELICS WERE VIEWED AS A MAKING PEOPLE CRAZY AND A UNIVERSIY PROFESSORS LOST THEIR JOBS FOR HAVING DISCUSSIONS LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU AND I ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW AM AND TH SOME PEOPLE WENT TO JAIL BUT MOSTLY MOSTLY PEOPLE EITHER LEFT ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS OR LOST THEIR JOBS WERE AS NOW THESE ARE AM SOME OF THE THESE STUDIES OF THE SORT THAT YOU ARE DOING IT THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AT STAMFORD AND HOPKINS AND ELSEWHERE ARE A SOME OF THE GREATEST MAGNETIC PULL FOR PHILANTHROPY FOR UNIVERSITIES DOWNERS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING THESE SOR TS OF STUDIES BECAUSE THEY AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND PEOPLE THEY KNOW SUFFER FROM PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS FOR WHICH AM THE CORRENT A BIG FARMER APPROACHES SIMPLY HAVE NOT WORKED SO IT'S SER SORT OF INTERESTING TO ME THAT WHAT ONCE WAS SEEN AS AM KIND OF POISON IS NOW BEING VIEWED AS A APOTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC A IT'S NOT JUST INTERESTING I THINK IT'S IT AHOFLY IT SPEAKS TO THE EVOLUTION OF OF THE HUMAN SPECIES PEOPLE SEEM TO BE COMING MORE OPEN MINDED ABOUT BECOMING MORE OPEN MINDED THAT'S YEH AND YET SAH YE IT'S SA THI SO MUCH AS HAPPENINGS SYPHAST AND AS ANOTHER ELEMENTS OF IT'S IT'S COMPLEXIFYING SPACE THAT'S A THERE IS CRITZIGU THERE'S BEEN SOME BAD PRACTICE IN PSYCHELICTHERAPY BOUNDARY CROSSING ISIES THAT AF COURSE SOME SCANDALS THAT'S TOO BAD ISN'T IT YT WELL YOU KNOW I THINK TO THE GENE THERAPY RIGHT IT JUST TAKES ONE BAD INCIDENT YAGENE THERAPY WAS ON A FAST TRACK THREE DECADES AGO AND THEN A WHAT SADLY A CHILD DIED IN A GENE THERAPY TRIAL AND IT'S LIKE SHUT DOWNGING THERAPY PRACTICALLY FOR HALF A DECADE AND THEN IT SLOWLY STARTED RACHETING UP AGAIN BREAGING THERABE BROADLY TO FIND AN HOUR IN THE AGE OF YUNO POTENTIAL DIRECTED GENE THERAPESIN CRISPER AN THINGS O THAT SORT WHICH MAKES PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE CRANGE AN OTHER PEOPLE VERY EXCITED YOU KNOW IF YOU V HUNTINGTONS IN YOUR FAMILY CRISPER IS LIKE THE MOST EXCITING TECHNOLOGY EVER BECAUSE YE COPOTENTIALLY ELIMINATE IT FROM YOUR FAMILY WANT GOING FORWARD CORSE SOI I JUST REALLY HEIGHT THAT WE CAN BE BALANCE AS THIS OLD PLAYS OUT BECAUSE IT IT COULD GO SIMILAR WAY GIVEN THE STAGEMENT GIVEN THE HISTORY THAT PEOPLE BE VERY TWITCY WITH WITH A SUMMISOLATED INCIDENTS A AND A AND I I OVERGENERALIZE THEM PERHAPS AM IN A SENSE ITS SHINING ALIGHTS ON THEM I THINK IS IMPORTANT THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY AS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REALLY DRILLS HOME HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THIS WORK BE DONE RIGHT AND AND WHAT THE NECESSARY SAFEGUARDS AND AND AT STANDARDS SHOULD BE AM A YO IT WON'T BE IT WON'T BE AN EASY RODE FORWARDS BUT AM BUT LET'S HOPE YOU KNOW WE GOT A HOPE THAT IT SUCCEEDS BECAUSE CORRENT TREATMENTS YOU PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE MATTER HAVE CRISIS AND TO YOUR POINT EARLIER ABOUT AN ERECIA RATE IT'S NOT ALWAYS ACTUALLY THE CASE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AND EPUTIMIOLOGY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATIR THAT YOU SEE A BIG INFLECTION AND YOU KNO DIGNOSEES OR CASES O PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS I WOULD SAY IT'S MORE THAT THE TREATMENTS HAVEN'T MOVED THEY HAVE' REALLY PROGRESSD THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY BETTER SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTY MORE OR LESS AND AND NEW DRUGS HAVE BEEN MORE OF THE SAME SO THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY PARADINE SHIFTS AND THAT'S WHY I GET A LITTLE IMPASSIONED WHEN I TALK ABOUT PSYCHODELIC THEROPEAN AN THAT POINT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW A DRUG EVERY DAY IT THAT SYSTEM 'S NOT COING IT YOU KNOW DO WE REALLY WANT TO KEEP ON WITH THAT SYSTEM A SURE YOU AT NOT EVERY ONE WILL WANT TO TRIP AND THAT WILL TERRIFY SOME PEOPLE SO MUCH THAT THEY'LL JUST ONE TO BE ON THEIR LEXOR PRIWOR OR A NON PSYCHODELIC PSYCHODELICAL WHATEVER AND OF COURSE IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THOSE OPTIONS OF COURSE AND THE MORE OPTIONS THE BETTER AND BUT I THINK THERE IS IT'S GREAT VALUE IN TAT REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT PSYCHODELIC THERAPY IS AND AND AND I THINK WHEN YOU DO YOU REALIZE AT IT IS TA MAJ O PARADIME CHALLENGE YOU MANY LEVELS AND AND THE FACT THAT IT'S DIFFERENT MY TAY IT'S IT'S GREATEST TO PAL MY TIN WELL I AM CERTAINLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PASSION FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR PSYCHODELICS TO BE ADDED TO THE ARRAY OF POTENTIAL TREATMENTS AND I REALLY ALSO APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU I PUT IT IN THEIR ALONGSIDE THE OTHER TREATMENTS MAYBE EVEN COMMINATION WITH OTHER TREATMENTS I SUPPOSED TO SAYN THIS IS THE THING THAT'S GON CURATE EVERYTHING AND YET THE PATION THAT YOU HAVE FOR THIS POTENTIAL PARADIME SHIFT THE ONE THAT REALLY APPEARS TO BE HAPPENING AT THE LEVEL OF CLENICAL DAYDON NOW IM IS SO IMPORTANT SO I WANT TO EXTEND IT A VOICE OF GRATITUDE FOR THAT AND FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING I MEAN I'VE BEEN OUTSIDE OF THIS FIELD BUT AS AN EARO SCIENTISTS A'VE BEEN PAYING CAREFUL ATTENTION TO IT REALLY FOR THE LAST FIVE SEVEN YEARS OR SO AND IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT IT IS A SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REALLY THINKING IN TERMS OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS NOW AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM FOR THE BETTER LIKE YOURSELF THAT ARE REALLY THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS A NEW MOVEMENT OR PARADIME SHIFT THAT WITHOUT QUESTION IS GOING TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOME SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT ALSO

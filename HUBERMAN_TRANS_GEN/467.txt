WELCOME TO THE HUBERMN SCIENCE SCIENCEPAETO I AM ANDRAHUBERMEN AND O'M A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPHEMOLOGY AT STAMPFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING OUR TOPICS THAT I BELIEVE DO NOT RECEIVE NEARLY AS MUCH ATTENTION AS THEY DESERVE FOR MOST PEOPLE THE TOPICS OF FLEXIBILITY IN STRETCHING BRING TO MIND THINGS LIKE YOGA INJURY PREVENTION ORE MAY BE VEN CONTORTIONISM BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING ARE FEATURES THAT ARE BILT IN TO OUR BASIC BODY PLAN YOUNG CHILDREN YOUNG ANIMALS AND ADULTS AND INDEED OLDER CHILDREN AND ANIMALS ALL STRETCH AND ALL HAVE SOME DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IT TURNS OUT THAT HAVING FLEXIBILITY AND OUR ABILITY TO STRETCH AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN STRETCHING AND FLEXIBILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO HOW WE MOVE ARE ABILITY TO LEARN NEW MOVEMENTS INDEED ALSO TO PREVENT INJURY WILL REPAIR INJURIES AND TO OFFSETTING AND REDUCING INFLAMMATION THROUGHOUT THE BODY IN FACT TODAY I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A REMARKABLE SET OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT STRETCHING CAN ACTUALLY ADJUST THINGS LIKE TUMOR GROWTH THIS IS WORK THAT WAS DONE BY ONE OF THE MAJOR DIRECTORS OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH SO TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL START WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE MECHANISMS LITERALLY THE CELLS AND THE CONNECTIONS FROM YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT MEDIATE FLEXIBILITY AN STRETCHING AND I PROMISE THAT I'LL MAKE THAT INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE TO YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A BIOLOGY BACKGROUND OR NOT THEN WITH THAT INFORMATION AND HAND I'M GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SAYS ABOUT THE BEST TIMES AND WAYS TO STRETCH EVERYTHING RIGHT DOWN TO THE DETAIL HOW LONG TO HOLD A STRETCH WHETHER NOT TO HOLD A STRETCH AT ALL BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEIR MULTIBLE KINDS OF STRETCHING  YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU OV STRETCHES WERE YOU HOLD THE STRETCH FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND USE AS LITTLE MOMENTUM AS POSSIBLE AND THEN THERE'S ALSO WHAT'S CALLED DYNAMIC AND BELISTIC STRETCHING WER LITERALLY SWINGING YOUR LIMBS TRYING TO INCREASE THE RANGE OF MOTION I WILL EXPLAIN THE SCIENCE AND APPLICATION OF FLEXIBILITY IN STRETCHING IN THE CONTEXT OF SPORTS PERFORMANCE WHETHER NOT YOU ARE ENGAGING IN PARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE OR RESISTANCE EXERCISE OR BOTH WHETHER NOT YOUR COMPETITIVE ATHLEDE OR SIMPLY A RECREATIONAL EXERCISEOR AS I AM WHETHEROR NOT YOU ARE TRYING TO INCREASE YOUR RANGE OF MOTION AND FLEXIBILITY FOR LONGEVITY PURPOSES OR WHETHER OR NOT YOUR TRYING TO DO IT IN ORDER TO ACTS ASS DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CAUSE WE'LL SOON LEARN TO DAY THAT YOUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY AND ITDEED TO ENGAGE IN SPECIFIC STRETCHING EXERCISES CAN ACTUALLY BE USED TO POWERFULLY MODULATE YOUR ABILITY TO TOLERATE PAIN BOTH EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL PAIN SO THIS THING THAT WE CALL FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING IS ASHY A VAST LANDSCAPE WE'RE GOING TO SIMPLIFY AND ORGANIZE ALL THAT FOR YOU TO DAY AND BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A NUMBER OF SIMPLE EASY TO APFLY TOOLS THAT ARE GROUNDED IN THE BEST SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT YOU CAN APPLY FOR YOUR SPECIFIC GULLS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASISE THE T THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZEROCOSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN AL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGH HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIUM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WIH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LLGIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION END THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEI'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT FLECIBILITY AND STRETCHING BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE PRACTICES OF FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING I LIKE TO JUST HILITE SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT ARE ALREADY BUILT INTO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND INTO YOUR BODY THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE FLEXIBLE SOME OF US FEEL TIGHTER THAN OTHERS SOMETIMES IN SPECIFIC LIMBS OR AREAS OF OUR BODY SOME PEOPLEL FEEL REALLY LOOSE AND LIMBER SOME PEOPLE EVEN HAVE WHAT'S CALL THE HYGH PERFLEXIBILITY I FOR INSTANCE HAVE A RELATIVE THAT CAN TAKE HER FINGERS AND BEND THEM BACK TO THE POIN WETH A TOUCH HER WRIST AND IT ALWAYS A YOU KNOW MAKES ME CRINGILO BIT BUT SHE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT ANY PAIN SHE SEEMS TO HAVE SOME HYPER FLEXIBILITY IN HER JOINTS I DO NOT HAVE THAT FEATURE SOME OF YOU MAY FIND THAT YOU ARE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN OTHERS NATURALLY AND SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING YOU DON'T NEED TO BUILD IN ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY WELL THINK BY THE END OF TO DAY IS EPISODE YOU' REALIZE THAT ALMOST ALL OF US CAN BENEFIT FROM HAVING SOME SORT OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT FLEXIBILITY AND HAVING SOME STRETCHING PROTOCOL THAT WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR LIFE IF NOT JUST FOR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE REASONS AND FOR POSTERAL REASONS THAN ALSO FOR COGNITIVE AND MENTAL REASONS AND I'LL BE SURE TO CLARIFY WHAT ALL OF THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW I LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT AND JUST HIGH LIGHT THE FLEXIBILITY THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE TO MOVE YOUR ARM BEHIND YOUR TORSO A LITTLE BIT AND THEN SORT OF LET GO OR STOP EXERTING ANY EFFORT IN DOING THAT YOU WOULD FIND THAT THE LIMB WOULD RETURN MORE OR LESS TO A POSITION NEXT YOUR TORSO LEAST I WOULD HOPE SO WHY IS THAT WHAT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE ASPEXIBE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM ASPECTS OF YOUR SKELETAL SYSTEM ASPECTS OF YOUR MUSCLES AND ASPECTS OF THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE THAT BINDS ALL OF THAT TOGETHER THAT TRY AND RESTORE A PARTICULAR ORDER OR POSISION TO YOUR LIMBS AND YOUR LIMBS RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER SO THAT REFLECTS A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF PROCESSIES THAT IT TURNS OUT ARE THE SAME SET OF PROCESSIES THAT YOU USE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO ENHANCE FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING SO LET TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND REVIEW THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF NERVOUS SYSTEM MUSCLE CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND SKELETAL TISSUE BONE THAT ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING AND HERE WE CAN POINT TO TOO MAJE YOUR MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM NURONS MEANING NERVE CELLS COMMUNICATE WITH MUSCLES AND THOSE MUSCLES COMMUNICATE BACK TO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LIMBS DON'T STRETCH TOO FAR THEY DON'T MOVE TOO FAR SUCH THAT YOU GET INJURED AND IN ADDITION TO THAT MECHANISMS THAT INSURE THAT YOU DON'T OVERLOAD YOUR MUSCLES TOO MUCH WITH WEIGHT OR WITH TENSION OR WITH EFFORT AND DAMAGE THEM THAT WAY AS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SECOND SECURITY MECHANISM OF MAKING SURETHY DON'T OVERLOAD MUSCLES CON BE LEVERAGE TOWARD INCREASING YOUR FLEXIBILITY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE PROTOCALS AND TOOLS THAT I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO VASTLY IMPROVE YOUR FLEXIBILITY OVER TIME BUT THERE ARE ALSO MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW YOU TO QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE YOUR DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITHIN JUST A FEW SECONDS SO LET'S ESTABLISH SOME OF THE BASI C BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS IN TIME WE TALK ABOUT BIOLOGY OR PHYSIOLOGY WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT STRUCTURE MEANING THE CELLS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS AND FUNCTIONS WHAT THEY DO THERE JUST A FEW NAMES TO UNDERSTAND YOU DO NOT HAVE TO MEMORIZE THESE NAMES THE IMPORTANT THING THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO KNOW IS THAT FLEXIBILITY AND THE PROCESS OF STRETCHING AND GETTING MORE FLEXIBLE INVOLVES THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS NURLE MEANING OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MUSCULAR MUSCLES AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE CONNECTIVE TISSUES THE STUFF THAT SURROUNDS THE NURL STUFF AND THE MUSCULAR STUFF ALTHOUGH IT'S ALL KIND OF WEAVE TOGETHER IN BRAIDED TOGETHER IN COMPLICATED WAYS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HARD OF FAHA WERE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FASHIA TO DAY ALTHOUGH IT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING TISSUE THAT'S REALLY DESERVING OF ITS OWN EPISODE FASHAL TISSUE WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT SURROUNDS MUSCLES THAT REALLY GIVES YOU YOUR SHAPE AND HOLDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY TO OCCUR SO HERE'S A KEY THING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW WHETHER NOT YOU TALK ABOUT FLEXIBILITY OR NOT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROLLS YOUR MUSCLES IT'S WHAT GETS YOUR MUSCLES TO CONTRACT SO WITHIN YOUR SPINAL CORD YOU HAVE A CATEGORY OF NURONS NERVE CELLS THAT ARE CALLED MOTOR NERONS TO BE PRECISE THEY ARE LOWER MOTOR NERONS CAS THERE IN YOUR SPINAL CORD WE CALL THEM LOWER TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE MOTORNERONS THAT ARE IN YUR BRAIN UP IN YOUR SKULL THOSE LOWER MOTOR NERONS HEREAFTER I'LL JUST REFER TO THEM AS MOTORNERONS IF I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER CONEMOTORONS ELF SAY UPPER MOTORNON SO IF I SAY MOTORNRONS I JUST MEAN THE ONES IN YOUR SPINAL COURT THOSE MOTOR NERONS SEND A LITTLE WIRE OR SET OF WIRES OUT TO YOUR MUSCLES AND THAT CREATES WHAT'S CALLED A NURO MUSCULAR JUNCTION WHICH JUST MEANS THAT THE NURONS MEET THE MUSCLES AT A PARTICULAR PLACE THOSE NURONS RELEASE A CHEMICAL THAT CHEMICAL IS CALLED A SETAL COALING SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HARD ABOUT A SETO CALLING BEFORE A SETO CALLING ALSO EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN AND DOES OTHER THINGS IN YOUR BRAIN MAINLY IT'S INVOLVED IN FOCUS AND ATTENTION BUT AT THE NUROL MUSCULAR JUNCTION THE RELEASE OF A SEDO COALING FROM THESE NERVE CELLS THESE NURONS ON TO THE MUSCLES CAUSES THE MUSCLES TO CONTRACT AND WHEN MUSCLES CONTRACT THEY ARE ABLE TO MOVE LIMBS BY WAY OF CHANGING THE LENGTH OF THE MUSCLE ADJUSTING THE FUNCTION OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE LIKE TENDONS ANLIGAMENTS AND FOR INSTANCE OF YOU'RE BRINGING YOUR WRIST CLOSER TO YOUR SHOULDER THAT BICEPTS MUSCLE IS CONTRACTING IT'S GETTING SHORTER I MEAN IN REALITY IT HASN'T GOTTIN SHORTOR OVER ALL IT'S JUST TEMPORARILY SHORTER OF COURSE ALL OF THAT IS CONTROLLED BY NURONS AND IT'S THOSE MOTOR NERONS FROM THE SPINAL CORD THAT ARE REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJOR MOVEMENT OF YOUR LIMBS BY WAY OF CAUSING CONTRACTION OF SPECIFIC MUSCLES AT SPECIFIC TIMES SO THE KEYTHING TO TAKE AWAY IS THAT NERVE CONTROLS THE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLES NOW WITH IN THE MUSCLES THEMSELVES THERE ARE NERVE CONNECTIONS AND THESE ARE NERVE CONNECTIONS THAT ARISE FROM A DIFFERENT SET OF NURONS IN THE SPINAL CORD THAT WE CALL SENSORY NURONS THE SENSORY NURONS EXIST IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE SPINAL CORD AND THEY SEND A LOW WIRE OR SET OF WIRES INTO THE MUSCLES AND THERE'S A PARTICULAR KIND OF SENSORY NURN THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR SPINAL CORD AND INTUR MUSCLES WHICH ARE CALLED SPINDLE NURONS THEY CREATE OR THEY ACTIUALLY RAP AROUND MUSCLE FIBRES AND CORK SCREW ROUND THEM GIVE KIND OF A SPRING LIKE APPEARANCE IF FOR YOU A PYSIONATOES OUT THERE THESE ARE INTRIFUSALE CONNECTIONS OR NURONS INTREFUSAL MEANS WITHIN THE MUSCLE BUT YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT UNLES YOURE REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT IT OR YOU CAN BECOME A NURROW SCIENCES TOR YOUR MEDICAL SCHOOL OR SOMETHING THESE SPINDLE CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE MUSCLE THAT RAP AROUND THE MUSCLE FIBRES SENSE THE STRETCH OF THOSE MUSCLE FIBRES SO NOW WE HAVE TWO PARTS TO THE SYSTEM THAT I'VE DESCRIBED YOU'VE GOT MOTOR NONS THAT CAN CAUSE MUSCLES TO CONTRACT AND SHORTEN AND WE HAVE THESE SPINDLES WITHIN THE MUSCLES THEMSELVES THAT RAP AROUND THE MUSCLE FIBRES AND THAT INFORMATION IS SENT FROM THE MUSCLE BACK TO THE SPINAL CORD IT'S A FORM OF SENSING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MUSCLE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR EYE THAT SENSE LIGHT IN YOUR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR EAR THAT SENTS SOUND WAVES IN YOUR EXSTERNAL ENVIRONMENT YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR SPINAL CORD THAT ARE SENSORY NURONS THAT ARE SENSING THE AMOUNT OF STRETCH IN THE MUSCLES WHAT HAPPENS IS IF A GIVEN MUSCLE IS STRETCHING REALLY FAR THOSE CENSORY NURONS THOSE SPINDLES WITHIN THE MUSCL WILL ACTIVATE AND WILL SEND A ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL LITERALLY A BIT OF ELECTRICITY ALONG THAT WIRE'S LENGTH INTO THE SPINAL CORD AND THEN WITHIN THE SPINAL CORD THAT SENSORY NOR ON COMMUNICATES THROUGH A SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE STEPS BUT TO THE MOTOR NURON AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT MOTOR NUR ON CONTRACTS NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE USEFUL WELL WHAT THIS DOES IS IT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE IF A MUSCLE IS OR IS STRETCHING TOO MUCH BECAUSE THE RANGE OF MOTION OF A LIMB IS INCREASE TOO MUCH THEN THE MUSCLE WILL CONTRACT TO BRING THAT LIMB RANGE OF MOTION INTO A SAFE RANGE AGAIN NOW WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER ARE NOT ARRANGE OF MOTION IS QUOTING QUO SAFE OR NOT IS DICTATED BY A NUMBER OF THINGS IT'S DICTATED BY THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THIS KIND OF LOOP OF NURL CONNECTIONS IN THE SPINAL CORD AN MUSCLE IT'S ALSO DETERMINE BY WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD LITEALLY IN YOUR MIND COGNIVELY ABOUT WHETHER NOT THE MOVEMENT OF THAT LIMB IT'S INCREASING RANGE OF MOTION IS GOOD FOR YOU WHETHER NOT YOU'RE DOING IT DELIBERATELY WHETHER NOT IT'S BAD FOR YOU AND THEN THERE ALSO SOME BASIC SAFETY MECHANISMS THAT ARE PUT IN THERE THAT REALLY TRYING RESTRICT OUR LIMB RANGE OF MOTION CA SO JUST TO CLARIFY THIS WHOLE THING LOOKS LIKE A LOOP AND THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THE LOOP ARE MOTOR NURONS CONTRACT MUSCLES CENSRY NURONS OF WHICH THERE ARE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES M IN THIS CASE WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE SPINDLES ARE SENSING STRETCH WITHIN THE MUSCLES AND IF IT GIVEN MUSCLE IS ELONGATING BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED RANGE OF MOTION OF A LIMB THOSE CENSORY NURONS SEND AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL INTO THE SPINAL CORD SUCH THAT THERE IS AN ACTIVATION OF THE MOTOR NERON WHICH BY NOW SHOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE AS TO WHY THAT'S USEFUL IT THEN SHORTENS UP THE MUSCLE AT ACTUALLY DOESN'T REALLY SHORTEN TH MUSCLE BUT CONTRACTS THE MUSCLE THAT BRINGS THE LIMB BACK INTO A SAFE RANGE OF MOTION K SO THIS PROCESS IS VERY FAST IT WAS DESIGN TO KEEP YOUR BODY TOGETHER AND SAFE IT'S DESIGN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T YOU KNOW TAKE YOUR ARM AND SWING IT BEHIND YOUR TORSOAN AGES GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF YOUR BACK AN AN UNLESS YOUR CONTORTION AS TO OUTRAIN THAT KIND OF LEVEL FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE BECAUSE IT COULD PROVIDE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO THE MUSCLES AND TO THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND SO FORTH SO THAT'S ONE BASIC MECHANISM THAT WE WANT A HOLD IN MIND THIS IDEA OF A SPINDLE THAT SENSES STRETCH AND CAN ACTIVATE CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES AND SHORTEN HE MUSCLES THE NEXT MECHANISM I WANT TO DESCRIBE AND ONCE AGAIN THERE ONLY TOO THAT YOU NEED TO HOLD IN MIND FUR THIS EPISODE THIS OTHER MECHANISM HAS A LOT OF THE SAME FEATURES AS THE ONE I JUST DESCRIBED BUT IT HAS LESS TO DO WITH STRETCH IN FACT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO A STRETCH AS MUCH AS IT HAS TO DO WITH SENSING LOADS SO AT THE END OF EACH MUSCLS YOU HAVE TENDONS TYPICALLY AND THERE ARE NURONS THAT ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE TENDONS THAT ARE CALLED GULGY TENDIN ORGANS RIGHT THESE ARE NURONS THAT OR SENSORY NURONS THAT SENS HOW MUCH LOAD IS ON A GIVEN MUSCLE RIGHTS IF YOU'RE LIFTING UP SOMETHING VERY VERY HEAVY THESE NURONS ARE GOING TO FIRE MEANING THAT CAN ASCEND ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY INTO THE SPINAL CORD AND THEN THOSE NURONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHUT DOWN NOT ACTIV IT BUT SHUT DOWN MOTOR NERONS AND TO PREVENT THE CONTRACTION OF A GIVEN MUSCLE SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE TO WALK OVER AND TRY AND PICK UP A WEIGHT THAT IS MUCH TOO HEAVY FOR YOU MEANING YOU COULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT INJURING YOURSELF AND YOU START TO TRYING HEAVE THAT WEIGHT OFF THE GROUND THERE RE NUMBER OF REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LIFT IT BUT LET SAY YOU START TO GET T A LITTLE BIT OFF THE GROUND ORE YOU START TO GET E SOME FORCE GENERATED THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO MOVE BUT THE FORCE THAT YOU'RE GENERATING COM POTENTIALLY RIP YOUR MUSCLES OR YOUR TENDONS OFF OF THE BONE RIGHT THAT IT COULD DESTRUP THE JOINTS THAT COULD TEAR LIGAMENTS WELL YOUHAVE A SAFETY MECHANISM IN PLACE IS THESE GULGY TENDIN ORGANS THESE G T OES AS THEY'RE CALLED THEY GET ACTIVATED AND SHUT DOWN THE MOTOR NERONS AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THOSE MUSCLES TO CONTRACT CAY SO ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE A MECHANISM THAT SENSES STRETCH AND CAN FIGURE OUT WHEN STRETCH IS EXC ESSIVE AND WHEN THIS SYSTEM DETECTS THAT STRETCHS IS EXCESSIVE IT ACTIVATES THE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLES AND THEN WE HAVE A SECOND MECHANISM THAT SENSES LOADS AND WHEN TENSION OR LOADS IS DEEMED EXCESSIVE BY THESE CIRCUITS AND REMEMBER THSE CIRCUES DON'T HAVE A MIND THAY DON'T GO THIS IS EXCESSIVE THEY JUST SENSE LOADS AND WHEN THOSE LOADS EXCEED A CERTAIN THRESHOLD WELL THEN THOSE G TIOS TOSE GULGY TEND IN ORDEND SEND SIGNALS INTO THE SPINAL CORD THAT SHUT DOWN YOUR MOTOR NERONSIBILITY TO CONTRACT MUSCLE SO THAT YOU NO LONGER CAN LIFT THAT HEAVY LOAD SO BOTH OF THESE ARE PROTECTIVE MECHANISMS BUT BOTH OF THESE CAN BE LEVERAGE IN A VERY LOGICAL WAY AND IN A VERY SAFE WAY IN ORDER TO INCREASE YOUR LIMB RANGE OF MOTION SO THERE COUPLE O THNGS I WON TO POINT OUT BEFOREGOING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO HOW YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROLS FLEXIBILITY AND STRETTION D THOSE KEY POINTS ARE THE FOLLOWING THERE ARE NOW DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT A DEDICATED STRETCHING PRACTICE CAN IMPROVE LIMB RANGE OF MOTION NOW FOR MANY OF YOU LISTENING YOUR PROBLESING DA BUT I THINK IS IN PORTANT TO POINT THAT OUT THAT A DEDICATED STRETCHING PRACTICE CAN INCREASE LIMB RANGE OF MOTION AND AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN THERE ARE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS THAT CAN EXPLAIN THAT EFFECT THE SECOND POINT IS ONE OF LONGEVITY AND WHEN I SAY LONGEVITY I DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN LATE STAGE AGING WE ALL UNDERGO A DECREASE IN LIMB RANGE OF MOTION UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING TO OFFSET THAT DECREASE AND THE CURRENT NUMBERS VARY FROM STUDY TO STUDY BUT IF YOU LOOK AND MASS YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE STUDIES AND WHAT YOU BASICALLY FIND IS THAT WE START TO EXPERIENCE A DECREASE IN FLEXIBILITY FROM ABOUT AGE TWENTY UNTIL ABOUT AGE FORTY NINE THAT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC AND THEN OF COURSE IT WILL CONTINUE AFTER AGE FORTY NINE BUT BASELY IT'S A TEN PER CENT DECREASE EVERY TEN YEARS SO WE COULD SAY IT'S THE ONE PER CENT DECREASE PER YEAR ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT NECESSARILY LINEAR WHAT I MEAN BY THAT WELL IT'S NOT NCESSARILY THAT ON YOUR TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY YOU ARE ONE PER CENT LESS FLEXIBLE THAN YOU WERE ON YOUR TWENTIETH BIRTHDAY AND DECREASED BY ONE PER CENT PER YEAR SOME OF THESE CHANGES CAN BE NON LINEAR SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE PERSON WHO IS DOING JUST FINE IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY AND THEN YOU KNOW THAT THEY GET TO THIRTY TWO AND SUDDENLY THEY'VE LOST FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR FLEXIBILITY NOW OF COURSE THERE WILL BE A TON OF LIFE STYLE FACTORS IF YOUR REGULAR PRACTICION OR YOGA IF YOU HAVE A DEDICATED STRETCHING PRACTICE IF YOU'RE DOING OTHER THINGS TO IMPROVE YOUR MUSCLE CONTRACTIBILITIES HERE DOING RESISTANCE TRAINING IT TURNS OUT CAN ACTUALLY INDIRECTLY IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT THE KEY POINT IS THAT MAINTAINING SOME DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY AND MAYBE VEN ENHANCING RANGE OF MOTION AND FLEXIBILITY IS OF IMMENSE BENEFIT FOR OFFSETTING INJURY PROVIDED IT'S NOT PUSHED TOO FAR THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE PUSHED THEIR LIMB RANGE OF MOTION SO FAR THAT THEY EXPERIENCE ALL SORTS OF INJURIES BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC INJURIES TO DAY WILL ALL SO TALK ABOUT HOW TO AVOID THOSE SENARIOS O CASE WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THEIAR MECHANISMS WITHIN THE SPINAL CORD MUSCLES AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE THOSE REMEMBER IT'S THE MOTORNERONS THE SPINDLES THE G TOS AND OF COURSE THE MUSCLES THEMSELVES AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE TENDENS BUT ALSO OTHER FORMS OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE THAT ESTABLISH WHETHER OR NOT A LIMB IS GOING TO STAY WITHIN A PARTICULAR RANGE OF MOTION OR NOT AND WHETHER NOT A LIMB IS GOING TO BE ALLOWED BY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO PURSUE OR HANDLE A GIVEN LOAD A GIVEN TENTION THERE ARE ALSO MECHANISMS THAT ARRIVE TO THE NER MUSCULAR SYSTEM FROM HIGHER UP IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FROM THE BRAIN AND THOSE MECHANISMS INVOLVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT FACITS THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL KNOW ABOUT IN FACT TO DEAMMINA TEACH YOU ABOUT A SET OF NURONS THAT I'M GESSING NINETY NINE POINT NINE PER SENT OF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF INCLUDING ALL YOU NERVO SCIENTISTS OUT THERE IF YOU'RE OUT THERE AND I KNOW YOU'R OUT THERE THAT SEEM UNIQUELY ENRICHED IN HUMANS AND PROBABLY PERFORM ESSENTIAL ROLLS IN OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE OUR PHYSIOLOGY IND OUR EMOTIONAL STATE SO WITHIN THE BRAIN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SENSE THINGS IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD SOMETHING RECALLED EXTEROCEPTION AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SENSE THINGS IN OUR INTERNAL WORLD WITHIN OUR BODY CALLED INTERROCEPTION INTERECEPTION CAN BE THE VOLUME OF FOOD IN YOUR GUT WHETHER NOT YOUR EXPERIENCING ANY ORGAN PAIN OR DISCOMFORT WHETHER NOT YOU FEEL GOOD IN YOUR GUT AND IN YOUR ORGANS THAT'S I SHAY YOU  ACCONT OF FEELING NA FEEL GRATE I FEEL SATED I FEEL RELAXED THAT THOSE ARE L DIFFERENT FORMS OF INTEROCEPTION THE MAIN BRAIN AREA THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH INTERPRETING WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR BODY IS CALLED THE INSULA I N S U ALE THE VERY INTERESTING BRAIN REGION IT'S GOT TWO MAJOR PARTS THE FRONT OF IT IS MAINLY CONCERNED WITH THINGS LIKE SMELL AND TO SOME EXTENT VISION AND TO SOME EXTENT OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ARRIVING FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD AND COMBINING WITH WHAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY AND MAKING SENSE OF THAT OF ALL THAT OR AT LEAST ROUTING THAT INFORMATION ELSE WHERE IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO MAKE DECISION LIKE IF YOU SMELL SOMETHING GOOD TO APPROACH IT OR IF YOU SMELL SOMETHING BAD TO AVOID IT THE FRONT OF THE INSULA IS REALLY DOING ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF ALONG WITH OTHER BRAIN AREAS THE POSTERIOR INSULA THE BACK OF THE INSULA THAT IS HAS A VERY INTERESTING AND DISTINCT SET OF FUNCTIONS THE POSTER INSULA IS MAINLY CONCERNED WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR SOMATIC EXPERIENCE HOW DO YOU FEEL INTERNALLY AND HOW IS THE MOVEMENT THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE DOING COMBINING WITH YOUR INTERNAL STATE TO ALLOW YOU TO FEEL AS I IS LIKE TO SAY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAINLY BACHES THINGS INTO YUM LIKE O THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOR ME YUCH THIS IS REALLY BAD FOR ME AND I NEED TO STOP OR ME THIS IS KIND OF NEUTRAL GUESS TO THIS ISN'T ABOUT FOOD BUT WE COULD SAY FOR MOST STIMULLE MOST SENSES WHETHER NOT THEIR SENSES OF THINGS INTER NALLY ARE EXTERNALLY OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION AND SO IT MAINLY BATCHES INFORMATION INTO YUM I WANT TO KEEP DOING THIS ORE APPROACH THIS THING OR CONTINUE DOWN SOME PATH OF MOVEMEN TO OUR EATING OR STAYING IN A TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT ET CETERA OR YUCH I NEED TO GET OUT HERE I DON'T WANT ANY MORE OF THIS I DON'T WANT TO KEEP DOING THIS THIS IS PAINFUL OR REVERSIVE OR STRESSFUL AND THEN ME SOM OF IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I CAN OSTAY RIGHT HERE OR NOT YUM YUCAN ME WELL IN YOUR POSTER INSULA YOU HAVE A VERY INTERESTING POPULATION OF VERY LARGE NURONS THES ARE EXCEPTIONALLY NARE LARGE NURONS CALLED VAN ECONOMO NURONS THESE ARE NURONS THAT ARE AGAIN UNBENOTES TO MOSTONER OL SCIENTISTS AND THEY SEEM UNIQUELY ENRICHED IN HUMANS CHIMPENSZIES HAVE THEM AND SOME OTHER LARGE ANIMALS HAVE THEM SO THEY'RE FOUND IN WHALES CHIMPENZIES ELEPHANTS AND INHUMANTS BUT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN MOST WHALES AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN MOST ELEPHANTS I MAN REMEMBER THERE ARE BABY ELEPHANTS AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY HAVE 'N BRED UP UM LIKE LIKE MANY ELEPHANTS YET THEY SEEM TO HAVE AA A TEACUP VERSION OF PRETTY MUCH EVERY DOG BREED UM CAN LOOK THAT UP I DON'T I CERTAINLY HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS NOTION OF OF TRYING TO DOWNSIZE EVERYTHING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN GINDLIKE THE POCKET SIZED BLL DOG I THINK OF SOME DAY WILL ARRIVE I'M NOT A FAN OF THAT KIND OF DOWNSIZING O OF DIFFERENT BREEDS BUT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T TEACUP ELEPHANTS AND TEACUP GERILLAS AND TEACUP CHIMPENZEES AND SO FORTH MOST ALL OF THOSE OTHER SPECIES ARE LARGER THAN US THEY HAVE THESE VEN ECONOMO NURONS AND WE HAVE THESE VAN ECONOMONERONS BUT WE HAVE IN UPWARDS OF EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THESE THINGS IN OUR POSTER INSULA THESE OTHER SPECIES TEND TO HAVE SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF A THOUSAND O MAY BE TEN THOUSAND OR SO WHISE THAT INTERESTING WELL THESE VAN ECONOMO NURONS HAVE THE UNIQUE PROPERTY OF INTEGRATING OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT OUR BODY MOVEMENTS OUR SENSE OF PAIN AND DISCOMFORT AND CAN DRIVE MOTIVATIONAL PROCESSES THAT ALLOW US TO LEAN INTO DISCOMFORT AND INDEED TO OVERCOME ANY DISCOMFORT IF WE DECIDE THAT THE DISCOMFORT THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS GOOD FOR US OR DIRECTED TOWARD A PACIFICSPECIFIC GOAL THIS KNOWLEDGE TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTAN TO KEEP IN MINE BECAUSE AS WE MIGRATE THISCOMVERSATION TOWARD THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO ENHANCE FLEXIBILITY IN STRETCHING YOU'LL SOON LEARN THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS WITHIN A STRETCHING PRO TO CALL WHERE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EITHER OVERRIDE PAIN AND DISCOMFORT S A KIND OF RELAX THROUGH IT OR PUSHED THROUGH IT THERE'S A DECISION FORK IN THE ROAD THERE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHICH WORK IN THE ROAD TO TAKE OR TO SAY A I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT I'M GOING ALLOW THESE NATURAL REFLEXES OF THE SPINDLE TO KICK IN AND JUST ESSENTIALLY STOP ME FROM STRETCHING IF A GIVEN LIM ISNI'N DESIGNED OR SHOULDN'T BE STRE THAT FAR SO I'D LIKELYU TO KEEP THESE VANICONIMO NERONS IN MIND I SHOULD MENTION THEIR NAMED VAN ACONOMO BECAUSE THE GUYDE CONSTANTIN VAN ACONOMO THAT DISCOVERED THEM AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS DECIDES TOE NAME THEM AFTER HIMSELF AS MANY SCIENTISTS DO OR CERTAINLY THE NEROLOGISTS AND AND PHYSICIANS ARE FAMOUS FOR NAMING THINGS AFTER THEMSELVES THESE VAN ECONIMO NERONS TURN OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE EMBARK ON OUR EXPLORATION OF WHAT SORTS OF STRETCHING PRACTICES CAN BE BEST APPLIED TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WHETHER NOT YOU UNDERTAKE A MILD MODERATE OR INTENSE FLEXIBILITY TRAINING YOU WILL NO DOUBT ENCOUNTER A SONAREO AT SOME POINT WHERE YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF DO I QOT AN RELAX INTO THIS STRETCH OR DO I TRYING PUSH THROUGH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DISCOMFORT AND I'LL EXPLAIN HOW TO GAUGE THAT DECISION IN A VERY SPECIFIC AND IDEALLY SAFE WAY AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME TOOLS THAT WILLOW YOU TO MAKE THAT DECISION IN THE WAY THAT BEST PRESERVES THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE NEURL CIRCUITS THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER AND CAN KEEP YOU SAFE THESE VAN CONYIMO NERONS SIT IN THE EXACT POSITION THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BODY IN PARTICULAR WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF LIMB MOVEMENTS HOW THAT RELATES TO OUR FEELINGS OF DISCOMFORT AND THEN THERE IS THE OTHER ASPECT OF THESE VAN ACONOMONERONS WHICH IS THAT THESE VAN ECONIMO NERONS ARE CONNECTED TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS THAT CAN SHIFT OUR INTERNAL STATE FROM ONE OF SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION SO THIS IS A PATTERN OF ALERTNESS AND EVEN STRESS SOMETIMES EVEN PANIC BUT TYPICALLY ALERTNESS AND STRESS TO ONE OF SO CALLED PARI SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION TO ONE OF RELAXATION OFTENTIMES YOU'LL HEAR THAT STRETCHING SHOULD BE DONE BY RELAXING INTO THE STRETCH WELL WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY MEAN TO RELAX INTO THE STRETCH WELL THESE VAN ECONIMO NERONS SIT AT THIS JUNCTION WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OUR BODY END ALLOW US TO ACUS NERAL CIRCUITRIES BY WHICH WE CAN SHIFT ARE RELATIVE LEVEL OF ALERTNESS DOWN A BIT ERE AE RELATIVE LEVEL OF STRESS DOWN A BIT AND THEREBY TO INCREASE SO CALLED PARI SYMPATHETIC ACTAVATION AND TO LITERALLY OVERRIDE SOME OF THOSE SPINDLE MECHANISMS EVEN THE G TO MECHANISMS BUT ESPECIALLY THE SPINDLE MECHANISMS AT THE NEURO MUSCULAR AND MUSCULAR SPINAL JUNCTION AND IN THAT WAY GENTLY SUBTILY OVERRIDE THE REFLEX THAT WOULD OTHERWISE CAUSE US TO CONTRACT THOSE MUSCLES BACK THE REASON THAT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN HAS THOSE OTHER KINDS OF MOTOR NERONS THE UPPER MOTOR NERONS THAT CAN BOTH DIRECT MEANING CONTROL AN CAN OVERRIDE LOWER MOTOR NERONS AC IF YOU A BRIEF EXAMPLE THIS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IN YOUR LIFE AND THAT WE ALL HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THE MONOSONAPTIC STRETCH REFLEX THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY FIRST YEAR NURO SCIENCE GRADUATES DO'T LEARNS WHICH IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO STEP ON A SHARP OBJECT WITH A BARE FOOT YOU WOULD NOT NEED TO MAKE THE DECISION TO RETRACT YOUR FOOT YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY DO THAT PROVIDED YOU HAVE A HEALTHY NERVOUS SYSTEM THERE ARE MECHANISMS IN PLACE THAT CAUSE THE RETRACTION OF THAT LIMB BY WAY OF INSURING THAT THE PROPER MUSCLES CONTRACT AND OTHER MUSCLES DO NOT CONTRACT IN FACT THAT THEY FULLY RELAX OCAY SO IN THE CASE OF STEPPING ON A SHARP OBJECT LIKE A PIECE OF GLASS OR A NAIL OR ATTACK YOU WOULD ESSENTIALLY ACTIVE AT THE HIPFLEXER TO LIFT UP YOUR FOOT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN DOING SO THAT SAME NERL CIRCUIT WOULD ACTIVATE A CONTRALATL MEANING OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BODY CIRCUIT TO INSURE THAT THE LEG THE FOOT THAT'S NOT STEPPING ON THE SHARP OBJECT WOULD DO EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE AND WOULD EXTEND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T FALL OVER ALL OF THAT HAPPENS REFLECTIVELY IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY THOUGHT OR DECISION MAKING IN FACT HUMANS WITHOUT ANY NEO CARTEX LITERALLY THAT WHO ARE DECEREBRITE OR AN ANIMAL THAT DOESN'T HAVE WHAN I SAY TO SERBID I MEAN LACK OF CEREBRAL QARTEX THEY CAN PERFORM THAT BECAUSE IT'S ALL CONTROL BY CIRCUITS THAT ARE BASICALLY BELOW THE BRAIN AND IN THE SPINAL CORD S LOBIT OF ACTIVATION OF CIRCUITS IN THAT CON OF DEEPER PARTS OF THE BRAIN BUT BASICALLY YOU DON'T NEED TO THINK OR DECIDE IN ORDER TO DO THAT HOWEVER IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON WALKING ACROSS SOME SHARP OBJECTS LET'S AY UN LET'S MAKE A LOWLESS DRAMATIC SO IT'S NOT LIKE THE DYEHARD MOVIOR SOMETHING RE AS TO RUN BAREFOOT ACROSS THE GLASS ALTHOUGH THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M DESCRIBING HERE BUT LET SAY OU HAD TO WALK ACROSS SOME VERY HOT STONES TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO TO AVOID YOU COULD OVERRIDE THAT STRETCH REFLECTS BY WAY OF A DECISION MADE WITH YOUR UPPER MOTOR NER ONS YOUR INSULA AND YOUR COGNITION AND ALMOST CERTAINLY THOSE VAN ECONOMONORONS WHICH WOULD BE SCREAMING DON'T DO THIS DON'T DO THIS DON'T DO THIS COULD SHUTTLE THAT INFORMATION TO BRAIN AREAS THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO OVERRIDE THE REFLEX AND ESSENTIALLY PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN AND MAYBE EVEN IN FACT EVEN NOT EXPERIENCE THE PAIN TO THE SAME DEGREE OR EVEN AT ALL SO THESE VAN ECONOMONER ON SIT AT A VERY IMPORTANT JUNCTION WITHIN THE BRAIN THEY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY PAIN PLEASURE ET CETERA AND THAT INCLUDES WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR LIMBS IN YOUR LIMB RANGE OF MOTION THEY ALSO ARE PAYING ATTENTION AND CAN CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVATION KIND OF ALERTNESS OR COLMNESS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO CREATE WITHIN YOUR BODY IN RESPONSE TO A GIVEN SENSERY EXPERIENCE AND AS I MENTION BEFORE THEY SEEM TO BE UNIQUELY ENRICHED IN HUMANS THEY SEEM TO BE RELATED TO THE ASPECTS OF OUR EVOLUTION THAT ALLOW US TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH OUR BODY IN WAYS THAT OTHER ANIMALS JUST SIMPLY CAN BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I WANT TO GIVE YOU A PRACTICAL TOOL THAT YOU CAN OF COURSE USE BUT THAT WILL ALSO GIVE YOU INSIGHT AND EXPERIENCE INTO YOUR MUSCLE SPINDLE SPINAL CORD CIRCUIT MECHANISMS SO WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO IS IF YOU'RE IN A PROPER PLACE TO DO THIS YOU'RE GOING TO STAND WITH LEGS STRAIGHT MANING NEES NOT BENT AND YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AND TOUCH YOUR TOES OR FOR SOME OF YOU THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY EASY AND YOU MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR HANDS FLAT ON THE FLOOR I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITIES PRETTY EASY FOR ME TO TOUCH MY TOES I DON'T CARE IF YOUR ROUND YOUR BACK OR NOT ALTHOUGH IDEAL A I WOULD SAY DON'T ROUND YOUR BACK NOT BECAUSE IT'S BAD TO DO SO NECESSARILY BUT JUST TO TRY AND KEEP THIS A THE SAME FROM TRIAL TO TRIAL AS IT WERE SO TRY AND GET A SENSE OF WHAT YOUR RANGE OF MOTION IS IN TERMS OF BENDING OVER A AT THE WAIST WHILE MAINTAINING A FLAT BACK AND TRYNG TO TOUCH YOUR TOES OR EVEN TOUCH THE FLOOR MAY BE AGAIN YOU CAN EVEN GO HANDS FLAT TO THE FLOOR MAY BEVEN FAR OUT IN FRONT OF YOU OK NOW WHAT I'D LIKE YOU DOU A STAND BACK UP AND I'D LIKE YOU TO CONTRACT YOUR QUADRUSEPS AS HARD AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN FOR ABOUT FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS LET'S SAY TEN SECONDS JUST TO KEEP THINGS MORE OR LESS NORMALIZED THIS OBVIOUSLY IS NOT A SUPERCONTROLLED EXPERIMENT SO TO CONTRACT YOUR QUADRUSEPS FOR THOSE YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE OING TO EXTEND YOU'R LOWER LIMB OUT SO THIS WOULD BE LIKE KICKING ALTHOUGH DON'T DO TOO QUICKLY YOU'RE GOING TO KICK OUT YOUR A YOUR FOOT AM YOU SHOULD FEEL YOUR QUADRUCEPS CONTRACT ON THE TOP OF YOUR THIGS AND YURE GOING TO  TRYING CONSCIOUSLY CONTRACT THEM AS HARD AS YOU CAN CETYPICALLY A IF YOU WANT TO POINT YOUR TOE BACK TOWARDS YOUR NEAR SHIN THAT'S ALSO GEN A HELP SOMEWHAT TO CONTRACT EVEN HARDER AND HARDER KE SO DO THAT FOR ABOUT TEN SECONDS LOT IF YOU WILL DO THIS JUST WHILE STANDING CONTRACT CONTRACT TRACT OKA THEN RELEASE IT AND THEN NOW GO AHEAD AND REPEAT THAT STRATCH WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO TOUCH YOUR TOES OR TOUCH THE FLOOR STHIS AYS AGAIN RELYING MORE OR LESS ON HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY AMONG OTHER THINGS  WHAT MOST OF YOU WILL FIND IS THAT YOU HAVE AN IMMEDIATE INCREASE IN HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY OR YOUR RANGE OF MOTION HAS INCREASED IF YOU DIDN'T EXPERIENCE THAT THEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRY AND CONTRACT YOUR QUADRUSEPS HARDER AND LONGER SO MAY BE TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN TRY THIS SO CALLED EXPERIMENT AGAIN WHY WOULD CONTRACTING YOUR QUADRUSEPS ALLOW YOUR HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY TO SUDDENLY INCREASE WELL THE WAY THAT OUR MUSCLES ARE ORGANIZED IS SUCH THAT WE HAVE MUSCLES THAT ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO ONE ANOTHER SO OUR QUADRUSEPS AND OUR HAMSTRINGS WORK IN SORT OF A PUSHPOLE FASHION IF YOU WILL THEY CAN ANTAGONIZE ONE ANOTHER SO WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR HEEL TOWARDS YOUR GLUTS YOU ARE USING YOUR HAMSTRING THE HAMSTRING OBVIOUSLY ALSO DOES OTHER THINGS RELATE TO  MOVEMENT AND WHEN YOU LIFT YOUR KNEE OR WHEN YOU EXTEND YOUR FOOT AND CONTRACT YOUR QUADERCEPS YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY RELAXING THE HAMSTRINGS OF COURSE MOST MOVEMENTS INVOLVE BOTH QUADERCEP IN HAMSTRING INSYNCRANY AND THAT SYNCRANY IS REALLY AN ELEGANT ONE BUT HERE WERE MORE OR LESS ISOLATING THE QUADERCEPS FROM THE HAMSTRINGS AT LEAST TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN LEVERAGE THESE SPINDLE STRETCH MECHANISMS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU CONTRACT YOUR QUADERCEPS HARD YOU ARE RELAXING OR RELEASING SOME OF THE STRETCH THAT'S OCCURRING IN THOSE INTREFUSAL SPINDL SENSERY FIBERS GOING INTO YOUR SPINAL CORD AND AS A CONSEQUENCE YOUARE ABLE THEN TO STRETCH YOUR HAMSTRINGS FURTHER OR WE CAN THE MORE ACCURATE AND SAY THAT YOUR RANGE OF MOTION ABOUT THE HAMSTRING AND ITS RELATED JOINTS IS GREATER WHEN YOU AREN'T ENGAGING THAT SPINDLE REFLEX WHICH WOULD QUAUSE THE HAMSTRINGS TO CONTRACT CAS SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY YO HAS TIGHT HAMSTRINGS THERE COULD BE A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR THAT BUT PART OF THE REASON IS LIKELY TO BE NURL AND YOU CAN RELEASE THAT NURL SPINDLE REFLEX BY CONTRACTING THE OPPOSITE ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLE WHICH IN THIS CASE IS THE QUADRICEPS THE SAME THING IT IS TRUE AND CAN BE LEVERAGE FOR STRETCHING OTHER MUSCLES SO FR INSTANCE IF YOU GIN TO DO A TRICEP STRETCH THET TYPICAL CIND OF OVERHEAD WHERE YOU GRAB YOUR ELBOW AND YOU KNOW A MOVE IT TOWARD THE MIDLINE OF YOUR BODY WITH THE OTHER A USING YOUR OPPOSITE HAND WELL YOU CAN DO THAT AND THEN I WOULD SUGGEST TRYING TO FLECTS YOUR BICEP CONTRACT YOUR BYCEP THAT IS WHILE DOING THAT AND FOR MOST PEOPLE YOU'LL NOTICE A INCREASE IN THE TRICEP RANGE OF MOTION OR ABILITY KIND OF LEAN INTO OR TO RELAX INTO OR TO PUSH THAT STRESS STRETCH SCUSE ME A LITTLE IT FURTHER NOW FOR YOU PHYSIOSE OUT THERE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE BACKGROUNDS AND CANESIOLOGY I WANT ACKNOWLEDGE OF COURSE THER OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ARE COMING INTO PLAY THEIRE ACTUALLY NURL CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE JOINTS THEMSELVES THAT ARE PROVIDING PROPRIACEPTI FEE BACK ET CETERA ET CETERA BUT THIS IS SIMPLY TO ILLUSTRATE THAT PART OF OUR RANGE OF MOTION IS DETERMINED BY THESE SPINDLE MECHANISMS THAT I SPEND SOME TIME A FOCUSSING ON EARLIER AND INDEED THIS APPROACH CAN BE LEVERAGE TOWARD CREATING INCREASE LIM RANGE OF MOTION NOT JUST FOR THE HAMSTRINGS BUT FOR YOUR QUADERCEP SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE TIGHT QUADERCEPS YOU CAN DO THE OPPOSITE YOU CAN CONTRACT YOUR HAMSTRING VERY INTENSELY FOR LET'S SAY TEN SECONDS OR TWENTY SECONDS OR THIRTY SECONDS SO THAT WOULD TAKE SOME CONSCIOUS EFFORT OF BRINGING YOUR HEEL UP TOWARDS YOUR GLUTES A YOU COULD DO THAT IN A WAY THAT YOU REALLY TRYING TO  CONTRACT THOSE MUSCLES HARD YOU'D HAVE TO USE SOME DELIBERATE HAMSTRING ACTIVATION THEIR MEANING YEF YOU USE THOSE UPPER MOTOR NUR UNS AN THE OTHER ASPEX OF YOUR YOUR UPPER BRAIN POWER AS IT WERE TO TRY AND REALLY CONTRACT YOUR HAMSTRING SAYS INTENSELY AS POSSIBLE THAN YOU WOULD RELAX THAT AND THEN YOU WOULD DO YOUR QUADRUCEPT STRETCH AGAIN AND IF YOU DID A PREHAMSTRING CONTRACTION MEASUREMENT OF YOUR QUADRUCET FLEXIBILITY AND THAN YOU DID A POST HAMSTRING CONTRACTION MEASURE OF YOUR QUADRUCEP FLEXIBILITY ALMOST CERTAINLY YOU WOULD FIND THAT THAT FLEXIBILITY HAD INCREASED NOW OF COURSE THE MUSCLE REALLY DIDN'T CHANGE MUCH THE TENDANS DIDN'T CHANGE MUCH WHAT CHANGED WAS THE PATTERNS OF NURL ACTIVATION THAT WERE RESTRICTING YOU FROM IN THE FIRST CASE STRETCHING YOUR HAMSTRING OR HAVING A TO BE MORE ACCURATE WE SHOULD SAY HAVING A CERTAIN RANGE OF MOTION ABOUT TO THE HAMSTERING IN ITS RELATED JOINTS AND THOSE BREAK MECHANISMS WERE REMOOVED AND OF COURSE THEN WHEN YOU CONTRACT YOUR HAMSTRING YOUR REMOVING SOME OF THE NURL BREAKS THE SPINDLE ACTING AS A BREAK AND INHIBITING THAT QUADRUCEP RANGE OF MOTION CAS SO YOU CAN IMAGIN THIS IN FACT YOU CAN APPLY THIS FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MUSCLES THE LARGER MUSCLES AND THE SORT OF BISIPS TRICEPS AND A HAMSTRINGS QUADRUCEPS THAT ARTS OF THE SIMPLEST PLACE TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND TO APPLY IT BUT IN FURY AND INDEED IN PRACTICE IT REALLY WORKS FOR ALL THE VARIOUS MUSCL GROUPS IS JUST SOMETIMES HARDER TO ACCESS THESE SO CALLED ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLE GROUPS NOW WE SHOULD TAKE A MOMENT IN JUST DISCUSS WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AS WE GET MORE FLEXIBLE IN THE SHORT TERM AN LONG TERM I JUST MENTION WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SHORT TERM CLEARLY THOSE DON'T INVOLVE LENGTHENING OF THE MUSCLES IS NOT LIKE THE MUSCLE SLIDE ALONG THE BONES OR THAT THE TENDANS REALLY STRETCH OUT THAT MUCH MORE THAN THEY HAD PRIOR TO THAT KIND OF A YOU DON'T EXERCISE BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT IF PEOPLE STRETCH CONSISTENTLY OVER A GIVEN PERIOD OF SEVERAL WEEKS OR MORE THAT THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE MUSCLES THIS GETS A LITTLE BUT TRICKY AN TERMS OF NOMING CLATER AND I JUST WAN A HIGH LIKE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE A GET FRUSTRATED A AND CONFUSED IN FACT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MUSCLES GETTING LONGER YOU KNOW THAT THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF A MUSCLE GETTING LONGER IS IN IT REALLY IN KEEPING WITH REALITY BUT THERE ARE ELEMENTS WITHIN THE MUSCLES THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR CONFORMATION SO TO GET A LITTLE BUT DETAILED HERE AND WE WON'T SPEN TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS BUT I JUST WANT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS FOR THOSE OF EITHER INTERESTED IN NUR MUSCULAR PHYSIOLOGY AND HOW IT RELATES TO FLEXIBILITY YO YOU HAVE YOUR MUSCLE FIBRERS AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR SO CALLED MAYO FIBRALS SO O U CAN IMAGINE KIND OF A A SINGLE FIBR AN THAT FIBR OF COURSE WILL GET IN PUT FROM THOSE MOTOR NURONS AND THEN WITHIN THOSE FIBRES YOU HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED SARCOMERS AND YOU CAN KIND OF THINK ABOUT SARCOMERS AS LITTLE SEGMENTS KIND LIKE THE SEGMENTS OF BAMBOO IF YOU EVER LOOK AT BAMBOO IS NOT JUST ONE BIG STOCK IT'S GOT THOSE  OUT POUCHINGS ALONG THE WAY THAT AM AN A BREAK UP THE WHAT WOULD BE JUST ONE BIG STOCK OF BAMBOO INTO DIFFERENT SEGMENTS BUT THEY'RE ALL CAN NECTED THE SARCOMERES ARE SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT AND WITHIN THE SARCOMERS YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ONE THING IS CALLED MYASIN WHICH IS LIKE A THICK LAYER AND THEN THEOTHERS ACTIN AND THOSE ARE INTERDIGITATED AS WE SAY THE KIND OF CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER CONIC OF YOU ARE PUT YOUR YOUR FINGERS TOGETHER FROM YOUR TWO HANDS ON IF YOU  PUT YOUR FINGERS IN BETWEEN ONE ANOTHER ATS INTERDIGITATE LITERALY INTERDIGITATED IN THIS CASE SO PUNINTENDED AND THE MYASIN ENACTIN CAN IF MOVE RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER AND THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH YOUR ABILITY TO CONTRACT MUSCLES WHEN WE STRETCH MUSCLES WHEN WE GO THROUGH A STRETCHING PRACTICE THERER A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CHANGE SOME NURLE SOME RELATED DIRECTLY TO CONNECTIVE TISSUE BUT ALSO IT APPEARS FROM REALLY NICE WORK MAINLY DONE FROM M GILL UNIVERSITY PROVIDE A LINK TO A COUPLE THESE STUDIES IF YOU WANT TO DIG THEIR DEEP MORE DEEPLY THAT CHANGE THE CONFIRMATION THE RELATIVE SIZE AND SPACING OF SOME OF THESE THINGS LIKE SARCOMERES IN THE WAY THAT MYASIN AND ACT IN CAN WORK TOGETHER BUT WE DON'T WANT TO THINK OF MUSCLES AS LENGTHENING WE CAN HOWEVER THINK ABOUT THE RESTING STATE OF A MUSCLE BEING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT OR INDEED VERY DIFFERENT THEN THE RESTING STATE OF A MUSCLE OF SOMEBODY OR OF A LIMB THAT HAS NOT UNDERGONE REGULAR FLEXIBILITY TRAINING SO THAT'S AS MUCH TIME AS I WANT TA SPEND ON THAT BECAUSE WE COULD SPEND AN ENTIRE HOUR GETTING RIGHT DOWN INTO THE DETAILS BUT I DO WANT EMPHASIZE HOWEVER THAT MUSCLES HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS THEY HAVE FIBERS THEY HAVE SARCOMERS THEY HAVE MYASIN THEY HAVE ACTIN BUT THE IDEA OF MAKING OUR MUSCLES LONGER THAT REFLECTS A NUMBER OF PROCESSES THAT OCCUR BASICALLY WITHIN AN EXISTING MUSCLE LENGTH ARE THE LENGTH OF OUR MUSCLE BELLIES AND WHERE ARE INSERTIONS ARE A RELATIVE TO OUR CONNECTIVE TISSUE IN OUR LIMBS IS GENETICALLY DETERMINED RIGHT SOME PEOPLE HAVE FOR INSTANCE A BICEPT THAT GOES ALL THE WAY FROM THE CROOK OF THEIR ELBOW UP TO THEIR SHOULDER RIGHT OF AND SOME PEOPLE CAN YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE TO PUT THEIR ARM IN A NINETY DEGREE ANGLE COULD PUT TWO OR THREE FINGERS BETWEEN THEIR BICEP AND THEIR ELBOW THEY HAVE A WE CAN SAY A SHORTER BICEP RELATIVELY SHORTER NOW THE REASON I MENTION THESE HIGHLY DETAILE CELLAR MECHANISMS IS BECAUSE AS WE START TO EMBARK ON DIFFERENT PROTOCALS FOR USING STRETCHING TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE OF MOTION WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS PREVENTING OUR ABILITY TO EXTEND RANGE OF MOTION IS IT THE SPINDLE RIGHT IS IT BECAUSE THE MUSCLE IS STRETCHING TOO MUCH OFTENTIMES IT CAN BE BECAUSE OF THAT AND OR BECAUSE OF A SENSE OF PAIN OR SIMPLY A SENSE THAT THE MUSCLE IS NOT IN A POSITION THAT IAT'S BEEN IN BEFORE THAT'S UNRELATED TO PAIN OR TO SPINDLE ACTIVATION AND OFTENTIMES IT CAN BE RELATED DIRECTLY TO THESE CHANGES IN THE CONFIRMATION OF MYASIN ENACTIN AND WITHIN THE CONTEXTS OF THE SARCOMERES OF COURSE YOU CAN'T PEER INTO OR ENTS YOUR INDIVIDUAL SARCOMERES HOWEVER YOU DO HAVE NURONS THAT INTERVATE THESE AREAS AND THAT SEND THAT CENSORY INFORMATION BACK INTO THE SPINAL CORD AND UP TO YOUR BRAN TWO INTERPRET SO YOU'LL FIND THAT AS WE MOVE ALONG THERE ARE SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS THAT YOU CAN MAKE AT BOTH THE MACKERO LEVEL MEANING HOW MUCH MOVEMENT TO INSERT INTO YOUR STRETCHING RETIS I GIN E AESTATIC OR DYNAMIC OR EVEN A BULLISTIC STRETH OR FOR INSTANCE AT THE MICRO LEVEL THAT EVEN JUST A SLIGHT SUB MILLIMETER OR MILLIMETER INCREASE IN THE STRETCHING OF A GIVEN MUSCLE AND IN RELATED TISSUES CAN TRANSLATE INTO AN INCREASE RANGE OF MOTION PERFORMANCE AS A QUICK PUT RELEVANTS ASIDE I THOUGHT I'D SHARE WITH YOU SOMETHING USEFULL THAT'S ALSO GROUNDED IN THIS NOTION OF ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLES SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT YOU RESISTANCE TRAINING WHETHER NOTS WITH BODY WEIGHT OR WITH PHYSICAL WEIGHTS OR MACHINES WOULD HAVE YOU YOU MAY FOUND THAT IF YOU LET SAY WERE TO DO THREE SETS OF A PUSHING EXERCISE O THIS COUN BE PUSH UPS OHIS COAN BE BENCH PRESSES THIS COAN BE SHOULDER PRESSES SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND THEN LATER IN THE WORK OUT YOU WERE TO DO LET SAY MACHINE PULL DOWNS OR PULL UPS OR CHIN UPS OF SOME SORT SO A PULLING EXERCISE TYPIALLY WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IS IF YOU WERE TO DO WHAT'S OFTEN CALLED STRAIGHT SETS SO YOU WOULD DO THREE SETS OF PUSH UPS LET SAY WITH TWO MINUTES OF REST IND BETWEEN THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A CERTAIN NUMBER OF REPETITIONS ON THE FIRST SET JUST FORSAKE OF EXAMPLE LETS SAY YOU CAN GET TEN REPETITIONS ON THE FIRST SET AND THEN YOU GET EIGHT REPETITIONS ON THE SECOND SET AND THEN YOU GET SIX REPETITIONS ON THE THIRD SET WITH TWO MINUTES AND BETWEEN AND THEN YOU WOULD MOVE ON AT SOME POINT TO YOUR PULLING EXERCISES AND SIMILARLY LET SAY YOU WERE DOING CHIN UPS WERE PULL DOWNS AND YOU WOULD GET TEN REPETITIONS REST TWO MINUTES EIGHT REPETITIONS REST TWO MINUTES AND SIX REPETITIONS O KAY FINE WELL TYPICALLY WHAT PEOPLE DISCOVER IS THAT IF THEY INTERLEAVE THEIR PUSHING AND PULLING EXERCISES PROVIDED THEY DO THAT FOR MUSCLES THAT ARE ANTAGONISTIC TO ONE ANOTHER SO IN THIS CASE PUSHING WITH THE CHEST SHOULDERS AND TRYSEPS FOR THE PUSHING EXERCISES AND PULLING WITH THE BACK AND BISETS AND CURSE TAR OTHER MUSCLES OF OLLED AS WELL BUT BECAUSE THOSE MUSCLE GROUPS ARE AT LEAST IN PART ANTAGONISTIC TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN FIND IS THAT IF THEY WERE TO SAY DO THEIR PUSHING SET GET TEN REPETITIONS THEN MOVE TO A PULLING SET AFTER JUST SAY SIXTY SECONS AND PERFORM THAT PULLING SET THEN GO BACK TO THE PUSHING SET THEN GO BACK TO A PULLING SET PUSH PULL PUSH PULL ANOTHER WARS INTERLEAVING THEIR SET EVEN IF THEY WERE TO MAINTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF REST BETWEEN SETS OF PUSHING AND SETS OF PULLING WHAT THEY DISCOVER OFTEN IS THAT THE DROP IN THE NUMBER OF REPETITIONS THAT THEY GET IS SOMEWHAT OFFSET SO RATHER THAN GET TEN EIGHT SIX AS IT WERE WITH THE STRAIGHT SETS IT WILL BE TEN NINE EIGHT SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS NOT THAT YOUARE INCREASING THE TOTAL REST TIME TO FOUR MINUTES BETWEEN SETS BECAUSE THEN OF COURSE IT WOULDN'T BE EQUIVALENT BUT RATHER THAT WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAME AMOUNT OF REST BETWEEN SETS FOR THIS SAME MUSCLE GROUP BY GOING FROM PUSH PULL PUSH PULL OF ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLES YOU'RE ABLE TO HAVE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND THE REASON FOR THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE WERE DESCRIBING BEFORE WHICH IS THAT TYPICALLY IF YOU WERE TO DO PUSHSET REST PUSHSET REST PUSHSET REST WELL IN BETWEEN THOSE SETS AND IN FACT ACTUALLY JURING THOSE SETS OF PUSHING THE PULLING MUSCLES THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE CHINUPS ARE PULL DOWNS ET CETERA ARE ACTUALLY RELAXING OR AT LEAST ARE BEING RELEASED OF SOME TENSION INCLUDING THE ACTIVATION OF THE SPINDLES AMONG OTHER THINGS SO THAT'S A LONG WINDED WAY OF SAYING THAT INTERLEAVING PUSHION PULL OF ANTA ANTAGONISTIC SETS CAND LEVERAGE SOME OF THE SAME NARRL CIRCUITS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT LEVERAG ING FOR SAKE OF INCREASING FLEXIBILITY NOW I OFFER THIS TO YOU AS A TOOL THAT YOU CAN TRY OF ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH USING THIS TOOL HOWEVER IS THAT YOU OFTEN HAVE TO OCCUPY MULTIPLE SIHTS WITHIN THE GIM AH YOU KNOW IF YOU'R DOING THIS AT HOME AND YOU HAVE YOUR OWN GIM THAT'S ONE THING IF YOU'RE DOING THIS IN A GIM WE HAVE MULTIPLE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT W THEN YOU BECOME THAT PERSON WHO HAS ESSENTIALLY TAKEN OVER SOME SMALL CORNER OR MULTIBLE CORNERS OR MACHINES WITHIN THE GIM AND OFTENTIMES YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU'LL WALK BACK TO A MACHINE OR YOUR WALK BACK TO A GIVEN RESISTANCE EXERCISE IN SOME ONE HAS NOW TAKEN IT OVER IN THE WHOLE THING TO BE THROWN OFF SO IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF ORCASTRATING IN ORDER TO DO PROPERLY BUT IN GENERAL WHAT PEOPLE FIND IS THAT THIS CAN ALLOW YOU TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE OVER ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENTS AGAIN WHILE MAINTAINING THI SAME AMOUNT OF REST AND EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO DO THIS I INCURGE YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS AS A CONSET BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S LEVERAGING THIS IDEA OF ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLES FLEXORS AND EXTENSORS ANTAGONISTIC NOURAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SPINAL CORD MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL ONE SET OF MUSCLES AND ACTIVATING THOSE MUSCLES ALLOWING THE OPPOSITE ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLE TO RELAX AND THEREFORE TO PERFORM BETTER ON ITS NECK SET SO NOW I LIKE TO SHIFT TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT TYPES OF STRETCHING CANON SHOULD WE DO TO INCREASE LIMB RANGE OF MOTION IF OUR GOAL IS TO DO THAT IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE CAUSE I REALIZE THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF TIME TO DEDICATE TO A STRETCHING PRACTICE AND EVEN FOR THOSE OF US THAT DO I'M SURE THAT YOU WANT TO GET THEM MOST OUTCOME FOR A GIVEN EFFORT AND WHAT ARE THE MODES OF STRETCHING THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW US TO INCREASE OUR FLEXIBILITY IN LIMB RANGE OF MOTION MOST SAFELY NOW THERE ARE NUMBER DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRETCHING OR METHODS OF STRETCHING BROADLY DEFINED WE CAN DESCRIBE THESE AS DYNAMIC BULLISTIC STATIC AND WHAT'S CALLED P AN F STRETCHIN P NF STANDS FOR APPROPRIACEPTIVE NER MUSCULAR FACILITATION AND IT INVOLVES AND LEVERAGES MANY OF THE MECHANISMS THAT I DESCRIPE TO YOU EARLIER THE FIRST TWO DYMENSIOND DYNAMIC AND BULLISTIC STRETCHING BOTH INVOLVE SOME DEGREE OF MOMENTUM AND CAN BE DISTINGUISH FROM STATIC AND PAN F TYPE STRETCHION NOW TO DISTINGUISH DYNAMIC STRETCHING FROM BULLISTIC STRETCHING LIKE TO FOCUS ON THIS ELEMENT OF MOMENTUM BOTH INVOLVE MOVING A LIMB THROUGH A GIVIN RANGE OF MOTION IN DYNAMIC STRETCHING HOWEVER IT TENDS TO BE MORE CONTROLLED LESS USE OF MOMENTUM ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END RANGE OF MOTION WHEREAS IN BULLISTIC STRETCHING THERE TENDS TO BE A BIT MORE SWINGING OF THE LIMB OR USE OF MOMENTUM SO I INVITE YOU TO VISUALIZE WHAT DYNAMIC AND BULLISTIC STRETCHING MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN YOUR MIND YOU CAN EVEN TRY IT IF IT SAY FOR YOU TO TRY IT NOW YOU COULD IMAGIN YOU SWINGING YOUR ARM UP OVERHEAD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BRING IT DOWN I'M DOING THIS CAUSE IM SEATED AS CON RIDICULOUS MOVEMENT TO DO WHILE SEATED OR PERHAPS AT ALL BUT FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN SEE DYNAMIC AND BULLISTIC STRETCHING ANY TIME SOME ONE FOR INSTANCES HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING WITH ONE ARM OR MAY BE NOT HOLDING ON AN SWINGING OUT THERE THEIR FOOT SO ESSENTIALLY GETTING MOVEMENT ABOUT THE HIPJOINT AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT SOME PEOPLE RAISE IT UP AND PAUSED AND BRING IT DOWN THAT'S ONE FORM OF DYNAMIC STRETCHING WHEREAS OTHERS WILL SWING IT UP AND CSOR LETIC CARRY ITSELF A BIT FURTHER DO THE MOMENTUM AT THE TOP OF THE MOVEMENT AND THEN JUST LET IT DROP BACK DOWN OR MAY BE EVEN CONTROLL THE DESCENT THERE IS AN ENORMOUS RANGE OF PERAMETER SPACE HERE OR VARIABLES THAT ONE COULD IMAGIN AND THERE'S JUST SIMPLY NO WAY THAT WE COULD SUBDIVIDE ALL THOSE BUT AGAIN DYNAMIC AND BULLISTIC STRETCHING BOTH INVOLVE MOVEMENT SO WE HAVE TO GENERATE SOME FORCE IN ORDER TO CREATE THAT MOVEMENT BULLISTIC STRETCHING INVOLVING A BIT MORE MOMENTUM OR SOMETIMES A LOT MORE MOMENTUM ESPECIALYAT THE END RANGE OF OF MOTION NOW BOTH OF THOSE ARE HIGHLY DISTINCT FROM STATIC STRETCHING WHICH INVOLVES HOLDING THE EN RANGE OF MOTION SO MINIMIZING THE AMOUNT OF MOMENTUM THAT'S USED SO TO STAY WITH TA SIMPLE EXAMPLE THAT WHERE YE ARE ALL NOW FAMILIAR WITH FROM OUR EARLIER DISCUSSION SLOWLY BENDING OVER AT THE WAIST AND TRYING TO TOUCH YOUR TOES OR PUTTING YOUR HANDS TO THE FLOOR AND THEN HOLDING THAT AND POSITION BEFORE COMING UP IN A SLOW IN CONTROLLED WAY SUCH THAT YOU REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MOMENTUM TO NEAR ZERO WOULD BE ONE EXAMPLE OF STATIC STRETCHION STATIC STRETCHING CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO ACTIVE OR PASSIVE MIGHT THERE DIFFERENT NAMES FOR THESE KINDS OF APPROACHES YOU CAN HEAR ABOUT THE ANDERSON APPROACH OR THE JONDE APPROACH YOU CAN LOOK THESE SORTS OF THINGS UP ON LINE AND AGAIN PEOPLE TEND TO NAME THINGS AFTER THEMSELVES O SOME OF THESE ARE PROPRIETARY RELA TO SPECIFIC PROGRAMS I'M NOT FOCUSSING ON THOSE OTHERS COME TO BE NAMED AFTER THE PHYSIOLOGISTS OR THE PRACTITIONERS THAT INITIALLY POPULARIZE THEM AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE THERE'IS ALWAYS A NAMING AND RENAMING AND CLAIMING OF TERRITORY WITH THESE THINGS FOR THE TIME BEING I'D LIKE TO JUST EMPHASIZE THAT STATIC STRETCHING CAN BE BOTH ACTIVE WHERE THERE'S A DEDICATED EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE STRETCHER YOU TO PUT FORCE BEHIND THE HOLD TO THE KIND OF EXTEN OR LITERALLY TO EXTEND THE RANGE OF MOTION AND THEN THERE'S ALSO PASSIVE STATIC STRETCHIN IN WHICH IT'S MORE OF A RELAXATION INTO A FURTHER RANGE OF MOTION AND THAT CAN BE A SUBTLE DISTINCTION AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN FURTHER DISTINGUISH ACTIVE IN PASSIVE STATIC STRETCHION BUT NONE THE LESS STATI STRETCHING INVOLVES BOTH THOSE TYPES OF ELEMENTS ACTIVE IN PASSIVE BUT IS REALLY BUT ELIMINATING MOMENTUM AND THEN THERE'S THE PANEF THE PROPRACEPTIVE NER A MUSCULAR FACILITATION AND PROPRIACEPTION HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT MEANINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF NERA SCIENCE AND PHYSIOLOGY TO JUST KEEP IT REALLY SIMPLE FOR TO DAY PROPRIACEPTION INVOLVES BOTH A KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE OUR LIMBS ARE INSPACE AND RELATIVE TO OUR BODY TYPICALLY RELATIVE TO THE MIDLINES O THE BRAIN IS OFTEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ARE OUR LIMBS RELATIVE TO OUR MIDLINE DOWN THE CENTERE OF OUR BODY AND WE KNOW WHERE OUR LIMBS ARE BASED ON SO CALLE PROPRIOCEPTIVE FEED BACK SO THAT FEED BACK THAT COMES FROM SENSORY NURONS RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT SENSERY NERONS THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY MONITERING OR RESPONDING TO EVENTS WITHIN THE JOINTS THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND THE MUSCLES IN WITHIN THE DEEP COMPONENTS OF THE MUSCLES LIKE THE SPINDLE REFLEX AND WITHIN THE TENDENTS LIKE THE G TIO THE GOLGY TENDAN ORGAN SO PANEF TYPE STRETCHING LEVERAGES THESE SORTS OF MECHANISMS THESE THESE NORAL CIRCUITS BY WAY OF FOR INSTANCE YOU WOULD LIE ON YOUR BACK AND IF YOUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE YOURE HAMSTERING FLEXIBILITY AND THE FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE OF MOTION OF OTHER RELATED MUSCLE SYSTEMS YOU MIGHT PUT A STRAP AROUND YOUR ANKLE AND PULL THAT MUSCLE WHERE I SHOULD SAY EXCUSE ME THAT LIMB TOWARDS YOU N I CAN PULL THE MUSCLE TOWARDS YOU CAN PULLD THAT LIMB YOUR ANKLE TOWARDS YUSE TRYING TO GET ITS BACK OVER YOUR HEAD AND THEN PROGRESSIVELY RELAXING INTO THAT OR MAYBE EVEN PUTTING SOME ADDITIONAL FORCE PUSH THE AND RANGE OF MOTION AND THEN RELAXING IT AND THEN ACTUALLY TRYING TO STRETCH THAT SAME LIMB OR INCREASE THE LIMRANGE OF MOTION WITHOUT THE STRAP RIGHT SOMETIMES THESE ARE ASSISTED BY OTHER PEOPLE SO PEOPLE WILL EVEN USE LOADS SOMETIMESTHAT EVEN USE MACHINES O THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT A APPARATI THAT HAVE BEEN DESINED FOR THIS SOMETIMES ITW'L INVOLVE A TRAINING PARTNER THERE IS A HUGE RANGE OF PIANEF PROTOCOLS AND THOSE PROTOCOLVES CAN BE DONE BOTH BY ONESELF WITHARE WITHOUT STRAPS WITH MACHINES WITH ACTUAL WEIGHTS OR WITH TRAINING PARTNERS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE VARIATION OF EXERCISES TO SAY TARGET YOUR HAMSTRAINS VERSES YOUR QUADRASEPS VERSES YOUR SHOULDERS VERSES YOUR CHESS MUSCLES ET CETERA YOUR NECK MUSCLES AND SO ON THERE IS AN ENORMOUS RANGE OF INFORMATION ON DYNAMIC BALLISTIC STATIC AND PIANEF STRETCHES FOR ALL THE VARIOUS MUSCLE GROUPS AND I SHOULD SAY THERE SOME EXCELLENT BOOKS ON THOSE TOPICS THEIRE ALSO SOME EXCELLENT VIDIOS ON YOUTUBE AND ELSEWHERE NOWADAYS ITS PRETTY EASY TO FIND EXERCISES THAT ALOW YOU TO TARGET SPECIFIC MUSCLE GROUPS CAN I INCOURAGE YOU TO BE SAFE IN HOW YOU APPROACH THIS AND I WOULD INCURAGE YOU ALSO TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE INFORMATION THAT SOON FOLLOWS AS TO WHAT SORTS OF PROTOCALS ONE WOULD USE TO APPLY THOSE EXERCISES BUT THE NUMBER OF EXERCISES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE EXERCISES FOR TARGENING DIFFERENT MUSCLE GROUPS WITH THESE FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF STRETCHING IS BOTH IMMENSE AND FORTUNATELY THANKFULLY IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF US OFTEN AT ZERO COST SO SPECIFIC EXERCISES TO TARGET SPECIFIC MUSCLE GROUPS ASIDE WE'VE NOW ESTABLISHED THAT THERE ARE FORMAJOR CATEGORIES OF STRETCHING OR AT LEAST THOSE OF THE FOR MAJOR CATEGORIES I'M DEFINING TO DAY AND WE CAN FURTHER DIVIDE THOSE CATEGORIES INTO WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR INCREASING RANGE OF MOTION IN THE LONG TERM NOCHOUSIN ONE INDIVIDUAL SESSION AND THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES EXPLORING THIS I CAN LIST OUT AT LEAST FOUR AND WILL PUT THOSE FOUR AS A KIND OF A CLUSTER UNDER ONE HEADING IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTION S THAT ARRIVE AT ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ANSWER WHICH IS THAT FOR INCREASING LIMB RANGE OF MOTION IT DOES APPEAR THAT STATIC TYPE INCLUDING PIANEUV BUT STATIC TYPE STRETTIONG IS GOING TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAND DYNAMIC AND BULLISTIC STRETCION SO IT LEAST TO MY MIND THIS IS GOOD NEWS WHY IS IT GOOD NEWS TO ME WELL WHILE DYNAMIC AND BALLISTIC STRETCHION CAN BE IMMENSELY USEFUL FOR IMPROVING PERFORMANCE OF SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS IN PARTICULAR IN THE CONTECTS OF PARTICULAR SPORTS LIKE TENIS OR IN SPRINTING OR FRANKLY FOR ANY SPORT THEY DO CARRY WITH THEM A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK BECAUSE OF THE USE OF MOMENTUM SO YOU DON'T NEED TO BE HIGHLY TRAINED IN ORDER TO PERFORM THEM IN FACT THERE IS A PLACE AND WE WILL DESCRIBE WHEN ONE WOULD WANT TO APPLY DYNAMICOR BALISTIC STRETCION I'LL JUST GIVE AWAY FOR NOW I THINK THAT MOST PHYSIOS OUT THERE AND CERTAINLY THE ONES THAT I SPOKE TO DOCTOR ANDY GALLPIN DOCTOR KELLY STARET AN A FEW OTHERS POINT TO THE FACT THAT DOING SOME SAFE DYNAMIC AND BALLISTIC STRETCHING PRIOR TO SAY A RESISTANCE TRAINING SESSION OR MAYBE VEN PRIOR TO A CARDY OFASCULAR TRAINING SESSION CAN BE USEFUL BOTH IN TERMS OF RANGE OF MOTION EFFECTS AND IN TERMS OF NERL ACTIVATION EFFECTS ANDO ONE USE THE WORDS WARM UP BECAUSE WARMING UP IS TIPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH INCREASING CORBODY TEMPERATURE AS SHOULD BE BUT FOR ENGAGING THE NURL CIRCUITS AND BECOMING FAMILIARIZED WITH THE NARL CIRCUITS THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO USE IN OTHER MOVEMENTS WHILE ALSO INCREASING THE RANGE OF MOTION OF THE JOINTS INVOLVED IN THOSE MOVEMENTS THT Y CAN PERFORM THE MORE SAFELY AND MORE CONFIDENTLY SO I CERTAINLY NOT SAYING WON 'OT REPEAT I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THAT DYNAMIC ANBULLISTIC STRETCHING ARE NOT USEFUL THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE BUT IN TERMS OF INCREASING LIMB RANGE OF MOTION IN THE LONG TERM OF THE TRULY BECOMING MORE FLEXIBLE AS OPPOSED TO TRANSIENTLY MORE FLEXIBLE STATIC STRETCHING WHICH INCLUDES PIANEUF APPEARS TO BE THE BEST ROUT TO GO SO IF YOUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE YOUR LIMB RANGE OF MOTION FOR A GIVEN MUSCLE GROUP OF PERHAPS FOR ALL MUSCLE GROUPS ALTHOUGH CAN IMAGINE THAT BE PRETTY TOUGH IMING ANI CINE I SPEND TIME I COULD IMAGINE WORKING ON EUR TONGUE MUSCLE CONTROL OR NECK MUSCLE CONTROL END EVERY MUSCLE CONTROL BUT MOST OF US WANT TO REDUCE SO CALLED TIGHTNESS IN AIR QUOTES AND INCREASE LIMB RANGE OF MOTION FOR CERTAIN MUSCLE GROUPS AND IT APPEARS OF THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS GOING TO BE STATIC STRETCHING OF SOME KIND WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW OFTEN TO DO THAT STATIC STRETCHING AND HOW LONG TO HOLD THOSE STATIC STRETCHES AND WE CAN ALSO ASKE THE QUESTION WE SHOULD ASK THE QUESTION WERE TO HOLD THOSE STATIC STRETCHES IS IT ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO HOLD THOSE STATIC STRETCHES AT THE END OR THE POINT OF MAXIMAL RANGE OF MOTION WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT NOW THERE SOME TRIFIC SCIENCE AROUND THIS A SLIGHTLY OLDER STUDY BUT NONE THE LESS A POWERFUL ONE BECAUSE IT PROVIDED A FOUNDATION FOR A LOT OF SUBSEQUENT WORK WHICH BASELY SERVE TO JUST CONFIRM THE ANSWER THEY GOT HERE IS A STUDY FROM BANDY AT ALL THE TITLE OF THE STRUDY IS THE EFFECT OF TIME AND FREQUENCY OF STATIC STRETCHING ON THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE HAMSTRING MUSCLES THE STUDY INVOLVING NINETY THREE SUBJECTS SO SIXTY ONE MEN THIRTY TO WOMEN RANGING AN AGE FROM TWENTY ONE TO THIRTY NINE YEARS A BROAD A DEMOGRAPHIC WHO HAD LIMITED HAMSTERING MUSCLE FLEXIBILITY HERE ON PARAPHRASING AND RANDOMLY ASIDE TO ONE OF FIVE GROUPS SO THE FOR STRETCHING GROUP STRETCH FIVE DAYS PER WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS THE FIFTH GROUP WUS SERVED AS A CONTROL DID NOT STRETCH THE RESULTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT QUOTE THE CHANGE INFLEXIBILITY APPEAR TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE DURATION AND FREQUENCY OF STRETCHING THIS IS GREAT THIS TELLS US THAT STRETCHING FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF TIME SCALES WITH THE AMOUNT OF LIMB RANGE OF MOTION IMPROVEMENT THAT ONE WILL SEE THERE WERE MANY INTERESTING FINDINGS WITHIN THIS STUDY BUT THE ONE THAT I LIKE TO HIGH LIGHT MOST IS QUOTE THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDIES SUGGEST THAT A THIRTY SECOND DURATION IS AN EFFECTIVE AMOUNT OF TIME TO SUSTAIN A HAMSTRING MUSCLE STRETCH IN ORDER TO INCREASE RANGE OF MOTION NO INCREAS IN FLEXIBILITY OCCURRED WHEN THE DURATION OF STRETCHING WAS INCREASED FROM THIRTY SECONDS TO SIXTY SECONDS OR WHEN THE FREQUENCY OF STRETCHING WAS INCREASED FROM ONE TO THREE TIMES PER DAY A SO WE NOW WERE START ING TO LAY DOWN SOME PERAMETERS WHAT THIS STUDY REVEALS AND WHAT SUBSEQUENT STUDIES TELL US AND WE WILL GET INTO THOSE SUBSEQUENT STUDIES IS THAT IDEALLY ONE WOULD DO STATIC STRETCHES THAT ARE HELD FOR THIRTY SECONDS PERHAPS MORE IN CERTAIN INSTANCES AND ALL EXPLAIN WHEN THAT CAN BE USEFUL BUT HERE HOLDING THOSE STRETCHES FOR MORE THAN THIRTY SECONDS DID NOT TURN OUT TO BE ADDITIONALLY USEFUL SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO STRETCH YOUR QUADERSEP FOR INSTANCE AND YOU CAN A HOLD THAT STRETCH IN STATIC FACTION REMEMBER NOT USING MOMENTUM AND YOU CAN USE THE MENTAL TRICKS OF EITHER TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN WHICH I DON'T RECOMMEND NES U SARILY I THINK THAT MAKES US PRONE TO INJURY OR TO RELAX INTO THE STRETCH BUT NONE THE LESS PROVIDING SOME FORCE TYPICALLY WITH THE OWITH A HAND IN ORDER TO PPULL YOUR ANKLE BACK IF YOU'RE OING QUADERSEP STRATS SOMEPULE MIGHT DO THIS ON THE EDGE OF A SOFA REMEMBER THERE A LOT OF DIFFENT EXERCISES AND WAYS TO DO THIS THAT YOU CAN EXPLORE ELSEWHERE WELL HOLDING THAT STATIC STRETCH FOR THIRTY SECONDS APPEARS TO BE SUFFICIENT TO STIMULATE AND INCREASE IN LIMRANGE OF MOTION OVER TIME CAN THESE ARE PROTOCALS THAT WERE USED REPEATEDLY OVER TIME AND WILL TALK ABOUT HOW OFTEN TO REPEAT THEM IN ORDER TO GET MAXIMAL EFFECT BUT THIRTY SECOND HOLDS FOR STATIC STRETCHES IS THE NUMBER THAT I THINK WE WANT A FOCUSON AND THAT MOST OF US ARE GOING TO WANT TO UTILIZE SO NOW LET'S EXPLORE HOW MANY SETS OF STATIC STRETCHING ONE OUGHT TO DO IN ORDER TO GET A MAXIMUM RANGE OF MOTION IMPROVEMENT WHILE NOT PLACING US INTO A SYSTEM THAT'S CAN AT CREATE INJURY NOR A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY STRETCHING THROUGHOUT THE DAY BECAUSE AGAIN MOST OF U TON'T HAVE TIME TO DO THAT THIS ISSUE OF SETS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE IN THE CONTECTS OF CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE DATA THAT SUPPORT THE FACT THAT DOING AT LEAST A HUNDR AND FIFTY AND IDEALLY S MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED MINUTES PER WEEK OF ZONE TO CARDIOF ASCULAR EXERCISES VERY USEFUL FOR CARDOFASCULAR HEALTH AND FOR OTHER ASPECTS OF HEALTH AND OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS OF CARDY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE THAT CAN BE LAYERED ON TO AN INTO THAT THAT CAN BE USEFUL LIKE NINETY SECOND MAXIMAL SPRINTS ET CETERA DISCUSS US A LOT IN THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALPIN AND ON OUR EPISODE ABOUT ENDURANCE AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT SETS IN THE CONTECT OF STRENGTH AND HYPERTRIFY BUILDING BUILDING MUSCLE SIZE AND OR STRENGTH IN THE EPISODE ABOUT THAT AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALPIN AND THERE WE COULD ALSO ARRIVE AT SOME SPECIFIC PERAMETERS AND IT'S GOING TO VERY OF COURSE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS DOPENDING ON HOW HARD YOU TRAIN WHETHER NOT YOU TAKE SETS TO FAILURE YOUR REPETITION RANGE ET CETERA BUT IN THE CONTECT OF STRENGTH AND HYPERTROFY BUILDING WE ARRIVED AT A APPROXIMATELY SIX MAYBE AS MANY AS TEN SETS PER WEEK PUR MUSCLE GROUP SOME OF THAT WORK IS DONE AS DIRECT WORK TO A GIVEN MUSCLE GROUP SOME OF THAT WORK IS INDIRECT SO DOING CERTAIN PULLING EXERCISE OF COURSE WILL TARGET THE WHAT TISIMIS DORSY MUSCLES BUT ALSO THE BYSEP SO IF YOU THAT DOESN'T E SERELY MEAN YOU HAVE TO DO TEN SETS FOR THE BICEPS END FOR THE LAT SOMETIMES YOUARE GETTING SOME INDIRECT WORK ET CETERA ALL OF THAT WAS DELINEATED IN THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR ANY GALPIN AND WE ARRIVED AT THOSE NUMBERS OF SETS ACCORDING TO THE SAME CRITERIA THAT WE WILL APPLY HERE WHAT IS THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF SETS BOTH TO MAINTAIN AND TO IMPROVE A GIVEN MODE OF PERFORMANCE STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY OR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AGAIN TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE AND WE CAN DO THE SAME THING FOR IMPROVING OR MAINTAINING RANGE OF MOTION BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT IF WE DON'T DO SOME DEDICATED WORK TO IMPROVE RANGE OF MOTION OVER TIME WE WILL LOSE OUR FLEXIBILITY AND LIMB RANGE OF MOTION OVER TIME JUST BY VIRTURE THE FACT THAT WERE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO OFFSET THAT SO WHETHER NOT YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN RE ESTABLISH OR GAIN LIMB RANGE OF MOTION STATIC STRETCHING OF HOLDS OF THIRTY SECONDS APPEAR TO BE BEST NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG SHOULD YOU DO THAT AND HOW MANY SET SHOULD YOU DO THAT HOMMIY TIMES THE WEEK SHOULD YOU DO THAT AND TO ANSWER THOSE CRETCHIONS A TURN TO WHAT I THINK IS A REALLY SPECTACULAR REVIEW THIS WAS A REVIEW THAT WAS PUBLISHIN  YOUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO IT'S FAIRLY RECENT FIRST AUTHOR THOMAS A WHEN THOMAS LAST AUTHOR PALMA WE PUT A LINK TO THIS IN THE SHOWNO CAPTION THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS THE RELATION BETWEEN STRETCHING TYPOLOGY AND STRETCHING DURATION THE EFFECTS ON RANGE OF MOTION VERY STRAIGHT FORAR TITLE THIS IS A REVIEW ARTICLE THAT EXPLORED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STUDIES HAD CRITERIA FOR WHETHER NOT THOSE STUDIES COULD BE VALUATED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE QUESTIONS HERE HAD SOME QUALITY STANDARDS AND SOME OTHER STANDARDS THAT THEY APPLIED AND BASICALLY WE KNOW DOWN A LARGE COLLECCION OF STUDIES TO A REMAINING TWENTY THREE ARTICLES THAT WERE ABLE TO BE CONSIDERED QUOTE ELIGIBLE AND INCLUDED IN THE QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS DONE HERE SO KEY POINTS FROM THAT QUANTIFICATION AND SYNTHESIS DONE IN THIS PAPER FIRST OF ALL AND I QUOTE ALL STRETCHING TYPOLOGIES SHOWED RANGE OF MOTION IMPROVEMENTS OVER A LONG TERN PERIOD HOWEVER THE STATIC PROTOCOLS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT GAINS WITH A PE VALULESS AN POINTOFIVE WHICH MEANS A PROBABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAIND BY CHANCE ALONE WHEN COMPARED TO BALISTIC OR PIANEF PROTOCOLS SO AGAIN WHAT WERE HERING IS THAT STATIC STRETCHING IS THE PREFERRED MODE FOR INCREASING LIMB RANGE OF MOTION ALTHOUGH HERE THEY MAKE THE ADDITIONAL POINT THAT STATIC STRETCHING MIGHT EVEN BE SUPERIOR NOT JUST TO BALISTIC STRETCHING BUT ALSO TO PIANEF PROTOCALS BECAUSE BEFORE AS YOU MAY RECALL THERE WAS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOLISTIC AND DYNAMIC AND STATIC AND PIANEF AND SO HERE IT APPEARS AGAIN THAT STATI STRETCHING ISCOME SO RISING TO THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE OPTIMAL PROACH RELATIVE TO ALL OTHER STRETCHING APPROACHES AT LEAST IN THE CONTEXT OF INCREASING LIMB RANGE OF MOTION THE AUTHORS GO ON TO SAY TIME SPENT STRETCHING PER WEEK SEEMS FUNDAMENTAL TO ELICIT RANGE OF MOVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN STRETCHES ARE APPLIED FOR AT LEAST OR MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES PER WEEK OKA THIS IS CRITICAL THIS IS NOT FIVE MINUTES PER STRETCH REMEMBER THIRTY SECONDS PER STATIC STRETCH BUT AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES PER WEEK WHEREAS THE TIME SPENT STRETCHING WITHIN A SINGLE SESSION DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR RANGE OF MOTION GANS IF THIS IS GETTING CONFUSING I'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU SOON UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT WE CAN EXPORT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS THE DAY TO INDICATE THE PERFORMING STRETCHING AT LEAST FIVE DAYS A WEEK NOW SOME OF YOU MAY ALREADY BE GROANING FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES PER WEEK OKA SO FIVE DAYS PER WEEK THAT'S A LOT BUT AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES PER WEEK FIVE MINUTES PER WEEK IS NOT THAT MUCH USING STATIC STRETCHING MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO PERVOTE RANGE A MOTION IMPROVEMENTS OKET I'VE READ THE STUDY IN DETAIL NOW A THE HIGHLIGHT AGAIN THE REDUCTION IN FLEXIBILITY THAT OCCURS FROM TWENTY FORT NINE YEARS OF AGE AND SO ON HOW ACUTE BOUTS OF SHORT TERM STRETCHING UP TO THREE WEEKS CAN IMPROVE STRETCH TOLERANCE I THING THAT'S A KEY POINT THAT IN THE SHORT TERM THE FIRST THREE WEEKS OF EMBARKING ON A STRETCHING AND FLEXIBILITY PROGRAM MUCH OF THE IMPROVEMENTS COME FROM THE SHORT TERM NERL IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE OF INHIMITING THE SPINDALE REFLEX AND SO ON AND ALSO A STRETCH TOLERANCE A COMFORT WITH DOING THE MOVEMENTS AND MAYBE EVEN A COMFORT IN OVERRIDING SOME OF THE PAIN MECHANISMS I'LL TALK ALOBIT MORE ABOUT THAT IN NJUST A BIT AND THE PARTICULAR UTILITY OF YOGA SOMETHING THAT I DON'T OFTEN PRACTICE BUT THAT AFTER READING THIS ARTICLE THAT ILL MENTION IN LIL BIT I'M CONSIDERING PERHAPS TAKING UP SOME FORM OF YOGA PROTOCOL NOW H'VE ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM THE STUDY NAMELY THAT WE NEED TO GET AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES PER WEEK OF STATIC STRETCHING PER MUSCLE GROUP AND BASED ON THE PREVIOUS PAPER THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WE NEED TO DEVDE THAT FIVE MINUTES INTO SETS OF THIRTY SECONDS EACH AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT YO CAN DO ALL OF THAT IN ONE DAY UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES SEEM IMPORTANT THAT THE FREQUENCY OF STRETCHING PRACTICE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE WEEK IS IMPORTANT SO LET'S TALK PROTICALS WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT DOING STATIC STRETCHING SO HOLDING SO LIMITING MOMENTUM AND HOLDING A STRETCH FOR THIRTY SECONDS PER SET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO ACHIEVE FIVE MINUTES PER WEEK OF THOSE STATIC HOLDS BUT THAT WE CAN'T DO IT ALL IN ONE SESSION BECAUSE THE FREQUENCY OF SECTIONS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE WEEK CORRELATES WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS IN LIMB RANGE OF MOTION SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE DOING ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FOUR SETS OF THIRTY SECOND STATIC HOLD STRETCHES FIVE DAYS PER WEEK OR SOME VARIANT THEREOF AND I DO SAY SOME VARIANT THEREOF BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS THAT EARLIER STUDY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT HOLDING STRETCH FOR MORE THAN THIRTY SECONDS IN THAT CASE SIXTY SECONDS DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE ADDITIONALLY BENEFICIAL IT APPEARS THAT IF YOU DO HOLD THOSE STRETCHES FOR SIXTY SECONDS PER STATIC STRETCHING SET FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH STRETCHING FEWER DAYS PER WEEK OVER ALL SO IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE CAUSE I YOU REALIZE THEIRE ALOT OF PERMETERS AND YOU MIGHT BE ASKING WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST MAKE ME A LIST OF THE EXACT THINGS I SHOULD DO WELL IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY BECAUSE ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS AND ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR PARTICULAR GOALS THIS INFORMATION IS DESINE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A STRETCHING PROGRAM THAT IS TAILOR TO YOUR SPECIFIC GOALS IF I JUST GAVE YOU THE STRETCHING PROGRAM THAT I'M DOING OR I SHOULD SAY THAT I'M SOON TO BE DOING CAUSE I'M SOON TO BE DOING ONE BASED ON THE RESEARCH FOR THIS PARTICULAR EPISODE WILL THAT WOULD'T BE BENEFICIAL FOR YOU BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE VERY FLEXIBLE HAMSTRINGS BUT NOT VERY FLEXIBLE QUADRSEPS OOR YOU OUR SOMEBODY WHO IS ENGAGED IN SPORT OR NOT ENGAGED IN SPORT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GOING TO VARY SOMEWHAT SO WHAT WOULD EFFECTIVE STRETCHING PROTOCUL LOOK LIKE WE'RE ALL TRYING TO IMPROVE LIMRANGE OF MOTION FOR DIFFERENT LIMBS AND DIFFERENT MUSCELL GROUPS BUT JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE THATS BECAUSE THE ONE WE'VE BEEN USING LETS TOUK ABOUT HAMSTRINGS FOR THE TIME BEING DIS COULD OF COURSE BE APPLIED TO OTHER MUSCELE GROUPS LET SAY YOU ONT IMPROVE HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY AND LIMRANGE OF MOTION ABOUT AN AROUND THE HAMSTRING AND INVOLVING THE HAMSTRING YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THREE SETS OF STATIC STRETCHING FOR THE HAMSTRING AGAIN EASY TO FIND SUCH EXERCISES ON THE INTERNET YOU WOULD DO THAT BY HOLDING THE STRETCH FOR THIRTY SECONDS RESTING SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND DOING IT AGAIN HOLDING FOR THIRTY SECONDS RESTING SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN HOLDING IT FOR THIRTY SECONDS THAT WOULD BE ONE TRAINING SETION FOR THE HAMSTRINGS I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT YOU' PROBABLY WANT TO STRETCH OTHER MUSCELE GROUPS AS WELL IN THAT SAME SESSION ALTHOUGH AT LEAST AS FAR AS I COULD TELL THERE WERE SNO DATE APPOINTING THE FACT THAT YOU COULDN'T DO YOUR HAMSTRING STRETCHING ONE PART OF THE DAY AND YOURE QUATERSTEP STRETCHING ANOTHER PART OF THE DAY BUT PRESUME WHY YOURE GOIG TO WANT TO COMBINE YOUR FLEXIBILITY TRAINING IN INTO ONE SINGLE SESSION SO THREE SETS OF THIRTY SECONDS EACH YET NINETY SECONDS AND YOU WOULD DO THAT IDEALLY FIVE TIMES A WEEK OR MAYBE EVEN MORE BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTED THOUGHOUT THE WEEK IS IMPORTANT PERAMETER NOW ONE THING THAT WE HAVE NOT HIGH LIGHTED OR AT LEAST DESCRIBED IS HOW LONG TO REST BETWEEN STRETCHING SETS AND DESPITE MY EFFORTS I COULD NOT FIND RESEARCH BACK INFORMATION THAT POINTED TO WHETHER OR NOT THIRTY SECONDS OF REST FOR EVERY THIRTY SECONDS STRETCHING OR SIXTY SECONDS REAST FOR EVERY THIRTY SECONDS STRETCHING WAS IDEAL I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR INTERLEAVING REST WOULD BE APPROPRIATE OR AT LEAST DUABLE IF ANY ONE OUT THERE HAS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT REST BE TWEEN STRETCHING SETS AND HAS SOME PHYSIOLOGY OR SOME BIOLOGY OR SOME EXPERIENTIAL INFORMATION AS TO WHY A GIVEN RATIO OF DURATION OF STATIC STRETCH TO REST IN BETWEEN STATIC STRETCHD SETS I OUGHT TO BE USED PLEASE PUT IT IN O THE COMMENTS ON YOU TO THAT BE A TERIFIC WAY FOR US TO GET THAT INFORMATION I LOVE TO DO ANY FOLLOW UP TO LINKS THAT YOU PROVIDE AND SO ON BUT NOW WE'RE STARTING TO BUILD INTO A PROTOCAL THAT IS BACKED BY THE SCIENTIFIC TATA THREE SETS OF THIRTY SECONDS OF HOLTS DONE FIVE TIMES OR MAYBE VEN SIX TIMES PER WEEK ONE THING THAT DID SHOW UP IN MY EXPLORATION OF THE PURE REVIEWED RESEARCH IS THIS NOTION OF WARMING UP FOR ALL THIS WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT YET IN GENERALL TO AVOID INJURY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO RAISE YOUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE A BIT BEFORE DOING THESE KINDS OF STRETCHES EVEN THESE STATIC STRETCHES WHICH WE CAN SORT OF EASE INTO AND DON'T INVOLVE BOLISTIC MOVEMENT BY DEFINITION AND THE BASIC TAKE AWAY THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND WAS THAT IF WE ARE ALREADY WARM FROM RUNNING OR FROM WEIGHT TRAINING ORE FROM SOME OTHER ACTIVITY THAT DOING THE STATIC STRETCHING PRACTICE AT THE END OF THAT WAIT TRAINING YOUR CARTY OF ASCULAR OR OTHER PHYSICAL SESSION WOULD ALLOW US TO GO IMMEDIATELY INTO THE STRETCHING SESION BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY WARM SO TO SPEAK OTHERWISE RAISING ONE'S CORBODY TEMPERATURE BY A BIT BY DOING FIVE TO SEVEN MAY BEVEN TEN MINUTES OF EASY CART OF ASCULAR EXERCISE OR CALISTENIC MOVEMENTS PROVIDE YOU CAN DO THOSE WITHOUT GETTING INJURED SEEMS TO BE AN IDEAL WAY TO WARM UP THE BODY FOR STRETCHING WE SHOULD BE WARM OR WARM UP TO STRETCH AL THOUGH THOSE WARM UPS DON'T HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY EXTENSIVE AND THEN JUST BY WAY OF LOGIC DOING THE STATIC STRETCHING AFTER RESISTANCE TRAININGYOR CARDAVASCLAR TRAINING SEEMS TO BE MOST BENEFICIAL IN FACT AN UNFORTUNE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO THIS IN TOO MUCH DEDAL TO DAY WAS ABLE WILL FIND A NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT STATIC STRETCHING PRIOR TO CARTY OF ASCULAR TRAINING AND MAYBE VEN PRIOR TO RESISTANCE TRAINING CAN LIMIT OUR PERFORMANCE IN RUNNING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING I REALIZE THAT'S A CONTROVERSIAL AREA YOU HAVE THOSE WHO SAY NO IT'S IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL Y OVE THOSE WHO SAY NO IT INHIBITS PERFORMANCE IN THE THOSE THAT SAY NO IT'S A MATTER OF HOW EXACTLY PERFORM THAT STATIC STRETCHING AND WHICH MUSCLE GROUPS AND HOW YOU'RE DOING THIS AND HOW MUCH TIME IN BETWEEN STATIC STRETCHING AND PERFORMANCE BUT TO LEAVE ALL THAT ASIDE DOIG STATIC STRETCHING AFTER SOME OTHER FORM OF EXERCISE AND IF NOT AFTER SOME FORM OF EXERCISE AFTER A BRIEF WARM UP TO RAISE YOUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE DEFINLY SEEMS LIKE THE RIGHT WAY TO GO NOW FOR SOME OF YOU OUT THERE AND I CONFESS FOR ME AS WELL DOING SOMETHING FIVE DAYS A WEEK SEEMS LIKE A BIG COMMITMENT EVEN IF THAT COMMITMENT IS ONE TO ONLY DO THREE SETS OF THIRTY SECOND STATIC STRETCHES I SAY THIS BECAUSE YOUVE GOT THE WARM UP I GENERALLY LIKE TO BRING A A KIND OF A FOCUS IN DEDICATION TO A PRACTICE AND OF COURS SH BECAUSE WHEN DOING THESE KINDS OF PROTOCOLS IT'S LIKELY THA YOU'RE NOT JUST STRETCHING YOUR HANDSTRAING SO AS NUCH AS NINETY SECONDS OF WORK WITH A MINUTE OF REST IN BETWEEN BUT VERY LIKELY THAT ALSO DOING QUADRISUP STRETCHING AND ALSO DOING STRETCHING FOR THE SHOULDERS IN STRETCHING FOR THE BACK AND THE NECK AND SO ON AND SO THAT ENTIRE SESSIONS GON IT TAKE SOME TIME AND FIVE DAYS A WEEK IS A PRETTY SERIOUS COMMITMENT FOR MOST ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US THAT DON'T EXERCISE OR DOATHLETICS FOR A LIVING WHICH I DON'T SO THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE FROM THE LITERATURE THAT ONE CAN GET AWAY WITH OR I ONLY M KNOW THAT WE SOULDTHINK ABOUT IT AS GETTING AWAY WITH BUT THAT ONE CAN DO LONGER HOLD STATI STRETCHES OF UP TO SAY SIXTY SECONDS BUT DO FEWER TOTAL SESSIONS PER WEEK SO RATHER THAN THREE THIRTY SECOND STATIC HOLDS DOING THREE SIXTY SECOND STATIC HOLDS AND DOING THOSE EVERY OTHER DAY AND THERE REALLY HAS THEM IN THE SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION OF THIS THE ARTICLE THAT I WAS REFERRING TO JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO A THIS ANALYSIS OF THE A TWENTY THREE ARTICLES WAS COMBINED INTO THIS ENORMOUS A SET OF TABLES AND SOMEA REALLY QUITE NICE GRAFTS THAT YOU'RE WELCOME TO LOOK AT AND SINCE WEE CAN PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDY A THERE COUPLE OF KEY TAKE AWAYS THAT I WANT A MENTION THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THIS ISSUE OF HOW LONG TO STRETCION HOWOFTEN A FIRST OF ALL THEY DESCRIBE IN THER DISCRUSSION THAT THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS AN RANGE OF MOTION INDEPENDENT OF WEATHER NOT PEOPLE DID STATIC STRETCHING ACTIVE STRETCHING PASSIVE STRETCHING BULLISTIC STRETCHING AOR PIANE STRETCHING SO ALL OF THOSE FORMS OF STRETCHING WILL IMPROVE LIMB RANGE OF MOTION THIS IS A SENTIAL TO POINT OUT AND I WONE EMPHASISE THIS STATIC STRETCHING HOWEVER GAVE THE GREATEST DEGREE OF GAINS IN LIMB RANGE OF MOTION AND ON AVERAGE THEY SAW A TWENTY POINT NINE PER CENT INCREASE BUT SOME OF THE OTHER INCREASES THEY OBSERVE WERE ALSO QUITE SUBSTANTIAL SO BELISTIC STRETCHING CAN ALSO PROVIDE SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE LIMB RANGE OF MOTION IMPROVEMENTS HOWEVER THEY TENDED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF HERE THEY POINT OUT ELEVEN POINT SIX FIVE PER CENT INCREASE OR IN THE CASE OF PIANE OF FIFTEEN PER CENT INCREASE SO IT APPEARS THAT THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENTS IN LIMB RANGE OF MOTION FOR YOURE TIME SPENT AND EFFORT SPEND IS GOING TO BE THIS MINIMUM OF FIVE MINUTES PER WEEK TO ELISTIT A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE WITH FIVE DAYS BEING THE MINIMUM WEEKLY RECOMMENDED FREQUENCY TO ACHIEVE SIGSIGNIFICANT RANGE OF MOTION IMPROVEMENTS I CONFESS THIS WAS PRETTY SURPRISING TO ME A WHEN I COMPARE FLEXIBILITY TRAINING TO SAY RESISTANCE STRAINING FOR STRANGTH AND HYPERTROPHY I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE AND I KNOW THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND I THINK A DOCTOR ANDY GALPIN A WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT PROVIDED ONE TRAINS HARD ENOUGH AND APPROPRIATELY THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO TRAIN RESISTANCE TRAINING FIVE DAYS A WEEK IN ORDER TO GET SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHYS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NEED TO BUT YOU CAN GET A LOT OF POSITIVE RESULTS IN THOSE VARIABLES WITH LESS FREQUENT TRAINING CERTAINLY WITH THREE OR FOUR DAYS A WEEK OF TRAINING AND FOR CARDIOVASCULAR TRAINING I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY ONE HAVING TESTED WHETHER NOT ONE VERY LONG RUN EACH WEEK CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE CARTYOVASCULAR FITNESS HAND YOUR NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE OTHOUGH AFTER IMAGINE YOU PROGUSEY SOME IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO NOT DOING ANYTHING BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE DOING REPEATED TRAINING SESSIONS OF CARTVASCULAR'S TRIN TRAINING NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING FIVE DAYS A WEEK OF STRAINTH TRAINING IN AT LEAST THAT I'M AWARE IF SOME PEOPLE ARE BUT MOST PEOPLE I THINK ARE NOT AND SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING FIVE OR MORE DAYS A WEEK OF CARTYOVASCULAR TRAINING I'M GUESSING THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING FIVE DAYS A WEEK OF DEDICATED STATIC TRETCH RANGE OF MOTION DIRECTED TRAINING BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THAT FREQUENCY ABOUT THE WEEK GETTING THOSE REPEATED SESSIONS EVEN IF THEY ARE SHORT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL MUSCELE GROUP TURNS OUT TO BE IMPORTANT AND SO THAT POINTS TO THE PERHAPS THE REASON WHY SO FEW PEOPLE ARE DOING DEDICATE A RANGE OF MOTION WORK BUT IT ALSO REMINDS ME THAT ALL OF THE STUDIES THAT WERE DESCRIBED AT LEAST IN THIS REVIEW AND SOME OF THE OTHER ONES THAT WERE NOT REALLY SHOW IMPRESSIVE CHANGES IN LIMB RANGE OF MOTION I MEAN TWENTY PLUSS PER CENT OR EVEN FIFTEEN PERCENT WITH PIANEFOM IN THESE ARE BIG CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BENEFIT US THEY RE GOING TO OFFSET THE AGE RELATED LOSSES INFLEXIBILITY FOR SURE IF ONE IS DEDICATED ABOUT THESE PRACTICES AND IN MANY CASES THEY ARE GOING TO INCREASE LIMBRANGE OF MOTION IN WAYS THAT ARE GOING TO LOW US BETTER PERFORMANCE AND CERTAIN PHYSICAL ENDEAVORS CERTAINLY BETTER BALANCE ARE WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT BALANCE AND STABILITY BUT RANGE OF MOTION CAND IN PAIR BALANCE AND STABILITY IN SOME EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT BY EN LARGE LIMRANGE OF MOTION LACK OF TIGHTNESS IMPROVE POSTURE IMPRUEIMPROVE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE CUSE ME AND THINGS OF THAT SORT IS SOMETHING THAT THINK WE AN ALL BENEFIT FROM IT THATER KE FEATURES OF LONGEVITY WE DON'T OFTEN THINK OF THEM BECAUSE WE SO PRIORATIZE CARTY OVASCULAR HEALTH THAN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HEART AND BRAIN HEALTH TAND RESISTANCE TRAINING AND MUSCULAR SKELETIL A HYPERTROPHY OR STRAINGTH ET CETERA BUT AS I DELVED INTO THIS LITERATURE IT REALLY HIGH LIGHTED FOR ME THE EXTENT TO WHICH HAVING REALLY GOOD LIMB RANGE OF MOTION AT LEAST MAINTAINING LIMBRANGE OF MOTION AS WE AGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND MAY BE VEN IMPROVING LIMB RANGE OF MOTION CAN BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCING PAIN FOR AGAIN IMPROVING POSTURE IMPROVING AURE ABILITY TO PERFORM TO WALK ET CETERA AND INDEED THERE'IS A WHOLE LITERATURE THAT RELATES OUR LIMB RANGE OF MOTION TO THINGS LIKE PAIN MANAGEMENT OF THINGS RELATED TO HEADACHE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO LIMBRANGE OF MOTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT BECOMING A CONTORTIONIST OR BEING ABLE TO COMPLETE THE YOGOOD CLASS IT REALLY IS ABOUT MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY IN THE HEALTH OF THE NURL MUSCULAR SYSTEM THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND THE NURL MUSCULAR CONNECTIVE NET WORK BECAUSE THOSE ARE INDEED WORKING AS AN EKOSYST M AND A NETWORK I LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON PANEF STRETCHING FOR A MOMENT AGAIN THIS IS A VAST LANDSCAPE WITH MANY PARAMETERS AND IFFEREN PRACTITIONERS LOT OF A COMPETING OPINIONS A OUT THERE TO PUT IT LIGHTLY NONE THE LESS I I DO ONE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE PANEF TRAINING LEVERAGES THOSE SPINDLE MECHANISMS AND G T O MECHANISMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT I REALIZE THAT IN DESCRIBING THE QUADRCEP CONTRACTION HAMSTRING STRETCH THOUG MANY EXPERIMENT THAT HOPEFUL YOU DID THAT I DIDNT REALLY HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE OF THE G T OS THE GULGY TENDANT ORGANS THAT MUCH AND I JUST E LIKELY AS BRIEFLY DO THAT FOR A MOMENT THE G T OS HAVE MULTIBLE FUNCTIONS IN FACT I THINK EVEN THOUGH G TOS ARE IN EVERY MEDICAL TEX BOOK EVERY PHYSIOLOGY TEX BOOK EVERY FIRST YOUR NERL SCIENTISTS LEARNS ABOUT THEM WHEN LEARNING ABOUT THE NOR MUSCULAR JUNCTIONS AND THE MECHANISMS OF ENTERRECEPTION ET CETERA THEY ARE LIKELY TO HAVE OTHER FUNCTIONS AS WELL AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PNEF STRETCHING DOES WORK WHETHER NOT YOUR DOING THAT BY USING A STRAP TO YOU PULL BACK A LIMB OR WITH ANOT YOUR ACTIVELY CONTRACTING YOUR QUADRUCEPTS TO THEN RELEASE IN EMPHASIZE STRETCH RANGE OF MOTION FOR YOUR HAMSTRINGS AND RELATED MUSCLE GROUPS IS THAT ACTIVATION OF THOSE G T OS MEANING PUTTING LOADS AND TENSION INTO THE SYSTEM CAN INHIBIT THE SPINDLES IN THE OPPOSITE ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLE GROUPS AS SO ONE OF TE REASONS WHY FLEXING OR I SHOULD SAY CONTRACTING YOUR QUADRUCEPS REALLY INTENSELY FOR SOME BERRIARD OF TIME ALLOWS YOUR HAMSTRINGS TO SUBSEQUENTLY EXPERIENCE GREATER RANGE OF MOTION AND AGAIN IT'S NOTCIOUS THE HAMSTRINGS BUT THE RELATED CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND NERL CIRCUITS ET CETERA IS BECAUSE YES IT'S QUOTING RELAXING THE HAMSTRINGS AND THE SPINDLE BUT THERE'S ALSO A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACTIVATION OF THE G T OS IN THE QUADRUSEP AND RELEASE OF THE SPINDLES IN THE HAMSTRING AN RELATED MUSCLES THIS HAS A NAME IS CALLED AUTOGENIC IN IBITION S A FANCY NAME FOR CONTRACTION OF ONE MUSCLE GROUP PROVIDING A RELAXATION OF THE OTHER MUSL GROUP THAT'S ANTAGONISTIC TO IT AND IT REALATES BACK TO THIS IDEA OF INTERLEAVING SETS IN THE GIM SO IF YOU THINK BACK TO THAT EXAMPLE NOW IT SHOULD MAKE SENSE AS TO WY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU DO LET SAY A SET OF BENGE PRESSES OR SHOULDER PRESSES AND YOU LET SAY YOU GET TEN REPETITIONS AND YOU FAIL ON THE ELEVENTH THAT MUSCLE IS VERY VERY FATIGUED IF YOU WERE TO REST SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN GO BACK IN DO ANOTHER SET WELL DURING THE REST THAT MUSCLE GROUP HAS BEEN RELAXING ITS OBVIOUS NOT CONTRACTION THE SAME WAY IT WAS DURING THE RESISTANCE SET BUT BY GOING IN DOING A PULLING EXERCISE THAT INVOLVES THE ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLE GROUPS A STRONGLY CONTRACTING THE BACK MUSCLES THROUGH A PULL LIKE A PULL DOWN OR A CHIN UP OR A RO TYPE EXERCISE YOURE ACTIVATING OR NEAR ACTIVATING THE G TO SYSTEM IN THOSE PULLING MUSCLES IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES AUTOGENIC IN ABITION FOR THE PUSHING MUSCLES NOW AGAIN THE PHYSIOS OUT THERE ARE PROBABLY EITHER SCREAMING OR BANGING THEIR HEADS AGAINST WHATEVER A SOUND SYSTEM THIS HAPPENS TO BE ARRIVING THROUGH TO THEM SAYING WAIT BUT IN MANY CASES THE GE TIOS AREN'T ACTIVATED ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THAT AUTOGENIC INIBITION THAT'S TRUE BUT EVEN THE SUBTHRESHOLD ACTIVATION OF THOSE INTROSPINAL CIRCUITS SO THE PLACE WHERE THE G TO CIRCUIT AND THE SPINDLE CIRCUIT INTERACT CAN PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL REPLENISHMENT OF SAY THE PUSHING MUSCLES WHILE YOU'RE ACTIVATING THOSE PULLING MUSCLES AND THIS IS AT LEAST ONE NOT THE ONLY BUT AT LEAST ONE MECHANISMS BY WHICH INTERLEAVING PUSHIAN POLL PUSHAN PULL FOR BOTH STRENGTH AND IPERTROPHY TRAINING BUT ALSO FOR RANGE OF MOTION STRETCHING TYPE TRAINING CAN ALLOW YOU TO CHIEVE BETTER RESULTS IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME ND I RAISE THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE EFFICIENCY OF ANY TRAINING PROGRAMM WE JUST A MOMENT AGO ESTABLISH THAT DOING FOR EXAMPLE THREE SETS OF THIRTY SECOND STATIC HOLDS CAN BE VERY USEFUL FOR THE HAM STRINGS WITH LET YOU SAY FOR SAKE OF SIMPLICITY AND PRACTICALITY A MINUTES REST IN BETWEEN BUT DURING THAT MINUTE'S REST YOU CAN STRETCH THE OPPOSITE ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLE GROUP SUCH AS THE QUADROCEPS OR IF YOU WANT TO USE PIANEF TRAINING YOU COULD DO LOADING OF THE QUADRCEPS IN BETWEEN SO THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN START TO INTERLEAVE STATIC STRETCHING WITH PIANEF STRETCHING YOU CAN START TO INTERLEVE EVEN PIANEF TYPE PROTOCOLS WITH RESISTANCE TRAINING ALTHOUGH THAT GETS A BIT MORE COMPLICATED YOU CAN REALLY START TO CONSTRUCT AND BUILD PROTOCOLS THAT ARE IDEAL FOR YOU WHAT WE WILL DO IS FOR AN UPCOMING NURL NETWORK NEWS LETTER SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE'T FAMILIAR THE HUBERMAN LAPODCASS HAS A SO CALLED NURAL NETWORK NEWS LETTER THESE ARE MONTHLY NEWS LETTERS WHERE WE PUT DISTILLED POINTS FROM THE POD CAST AND OFTENTIMES PROTOCOLS IN A DOWN LOATABLE PETIA FORM YOU CAN ACCESS AT BY GIVING US YOUR EMAIL WE DON'T SHAROUR UNOU MEL WITH ANYBODY YOU ON SEE EXAMPLES OF THESE YOU CAN GO TO HUBERMAN LABDOT COMMON GO TO THE MENUINCE NEWS LETTER YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ANYTHING TO SEE EXAMPLES OR WHAT THESE ARE LIKE I'LL PROVIDE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS ONE THAT IS PURE STATIC STRETCHING ONE THAT INVOLVES PIANEF TYPE STRETCHING AND I'LL ALSO PUT DOWN A PROTOCOL THAT INVOLVES THE ANTAGONISTIC INTERLEVED MUSCLE TRAINING OF THE SORT THAT I'VE BEN DESCRIBING A FEW TIMES THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE AND THEN YOU CAN TRY AND APPLY THOSE EITHER SEPARATELY OR MAY BE COMBINE THEM IN SOME WAY THAT'S USEFUL FOR YOUR GOALS THERE ARE COUPLE OF KY ELEMENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR BUILDING A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE RANGE OF MOTION INCREASING PROGRAM THAT ARRIVE TO US BOTH THROUGH THE PURE REVIEW TO RESEARCH AN ADMITTEDLY FROM PEOPLE T HAVE BEEN INVOLVED I D TEACHING AND TRAINING RNGE OF MOTION FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE SOCLED ENDERSON METHOD S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME I SHULD HAVE NEVER MET ANDERSON I DON'T I SHOULD KNOW THIS I DON'T EVEN OIF HE STILL ALIVE I HOPE YOU STILL ALIVE BUT IN ANY EVENT THERE ARE LOT OF DIFFERENT FEATURES TO THE ENDERSON AND OTHER PROTOCOLS BUT ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THE ANDERSON PROTOCOL THAT I THINK IS HIGHLY RELEVANT IN FACT I KNOW IS RELEVANT TO THE PURE REVIEWED RESEARCH THAT WERE IN A TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MOMENTS IS THIS NOTION OF PUSHING THROUGH PAIN AND HOW ACTIVE OR HOW PASSIVE TO BE ABOUT STATIC STRETCHING AN THIS IS SOMEWHAT SUBJECTIVE RIGHT IF YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING INTO A STRETCH AGAIN WELL DISUSE THE HAMSTERINGS FOR EXAMPLES SO YOUR YOUR EITHER REACHING FOR YOUR TOES WHILES SEEDED OR I MAY BE USING A STRAP IN YOUR RAISING YOUR FOOT OVERHEAD WHILE LYING DOWN OR MAY BE O' YOUR YOUR DOING A TOTOUCH TYPE EXERCISE HOW FAR SHOULD YOU REACH WHERE IS THE END RANGE OF MOTION SHOULD YOU BOUNCE SHOULD YOU NOT BOUNCE WERE GOING TO TALK A LOBIT MORE ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT BUT ANDERSON HAS AN INTERESTING IDEA AND PRINCIPLE WHICH HAS THREAD THROUGH A LOT OF HIS TEACHINGS THAT I THINK ARE VERY MUCH IN KEEPING WITH THE STUDY THAT I 'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE NEXT WHERE HE EMPHASISES TO YEST TO STRETCH TO THE END OF THE RANGE OF MOTION BUT NOT TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON WHERE THAT RANGE OF MOTION HAPPENS TO BE THAT DAY SO FOR INSTANCE NOT THINKING OH I CAN ALWAYS TOUCH MY TOES FOR INSTANCE I AND THEREFORE THAT'S THE STARTING PLACE FOR MY FLEXIBILITY TRAINING TODAY BUT RATHER TO TAKE THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR SYSTEM INTO A COUNT EACH DAY AND UNDERSTAND THAT OKE PROVIDED YOUR WARMED UP APPROPRIATELY THAT YOU'RE NOW GOING TO STRETCH YOUR HAMSTERINGS FOR INSTANCE AND YOU'RE GOING TO REACH DOWN FOR YOUR TOES BUT THAT YOUR RANGE OF MOTION MIGHT BE ADJUSTED THAT DAY BY WAY OF TENSION AND STRESS OR BY WAY OF AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM AND TO BASICALLY DEFINE THE END RANGE OF MOTION AS THE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN FEEL THE STRETCH IN THE RELEVANT MUSCLE GROUPS I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE UNLIKE RESISTANCE TRAINING OUR PARTY AFASCULAR TRAINING WHERE WE CAN MEASURE DISTANCE TRAVELLED OVER TIME IN THE CASE OF CARDIVASCAR TRAINING OR HOW MUCH WEIGHT IS ON THE BAR AND COUNT REPETITIONS ET CETERA WITH RANGE OF MOTION TRAINING OF COURSE RANGE OF MOTION IS THE FEATURE THAT WERE INTERESTED IN BUT THERE IS LIKELY TO BE A LOT OF VARIATION FROM DAY TO DAY BASED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AND SO THE ENDERSON METHOD IS REALLY ABOUT GETTING INTO STATIC AND OTHER FORMS OF STRETCHING I THINK TO DAY WE MAINLYVEEN FOCASSING ON STATIC STRETCHING AND HOLDING THE END RANGE OF MOTION BUT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE FEEL OF THE STRETCH AND THE MUSCLES INVOLVED AND THERE ARE PARALLELS IN RESISTANCE IN CARDIVASCAR TRAINING TOO I REALIZE RIGHT IN THE CASE OF TRYINTO BUILD HY PERTRIFY OR I SHOULD SAY IMPROVE HYPURTAE MUSCLE SIZE OFTENTIMES THE BEST ADVICE THAT ONE CAN GIVE IS TO DON'T TRY TO LIFT WEIGHTS BUT RATHER TO CHALLENGE MUSCLES NOW OF COURSE YOU NEED T T PROVIDE ADEQUATE LOADS IN ORDER TO GET HYPERTROPHY BUT WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING PURELY FOR STRENGTH IT'S ABOUT MOVING WEIGHTS WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING PURELY FOR HYPERTROPHY OR MAINLY FOR HYPERTROPHY ITS REALLY ABOUT CHALLENGING MUSCLES USING WEIGHTS OR OTHER FORMS OF RESISTANCE AND SIMILARLY AND IN KEEPING WITH THIS ANDERSON METHOD WHEN TRING TO BUILD LIMB RNGE OF MOTION DOING STATIC STRETCHING AT A PLACE WHERE ITS DIFFICULT BUT THAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THE STRETCH OF THE MUSCLE COGNITIVELY CONSCIOUSLY BEING ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE MUSCLES AND THEIR STRETCH IS AT LEAST AS USEFUL AS IS VALUATING THE CURRENT RANGE OF MOTION YOU'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS FEEL THE MUSCLES AS YOU STRETCH THEM DON'T JUST GO THROUGH THE MOTIONE AND THIS MEANS DON'T GET SO ATTACHED TO BEING ABLE TO ALWAYS ACHIEVE FOR INSTANCE A STRETCH OF A GIVEN DISTANCE ON A WITHIN A GIVEN SESSION YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY FIND THAT BY JUST FINDING THE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN'T GET MUCH FURTHER AND HOLDING THE STATIC STRETCH THERE THAT ON THE SECOND AND THIRD SET THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE DOING THAT DAY THAT THEU RRANGE OF MOTION WILL BE INCREASED CONSIDERABLY MAY BE NOT BUT VERY LIKELY YES YOU WILL AND OF COURSE EVALUATING RANGE OF MOTION OVER TIME IS THE KEY PERAMETER BECAUSE THAT'S IT'S THE GOAL OF ALL THIS TYPE OF WORK NOW ALONG THESE LINES THERE IS THIS VARIABLE THAT WE MENTION A FEW TIMES OF PASSIVE VERSEIS ACTIVE STRETCHING AND THERE'S THIS EVEN MORE NEBULOUS VARIABLE THIS EVEN MORE KIND OF SUBJECTIVE THING OF HOW MUCH EFFORT TO PUT INTO IT SHOULD YOU PUSH INTO THE STRETCH YOU EVEN WANT TA BOUNCE A TINY BIT WOULD YOU WANT TO REACH INTO THAT AND POINT AN TRY AN EXTEND IT WITHIN A GIVEN SET AND SESSION AND FOR THAT REASON I WAS EXCITED TO FIND THIS PAPER O ENTITLE A COMPARISON OF TWO STRETCHING MODALITIES ON LOWER LIMB RANGE OF MOTION MEASUREMENT IN RECREATIONAL DANCERS A HAPIT TO BE DONE IN RECREATIONALL DANSERS IT'S IT SIX WEEK INTEREVENTION PROGRAMM THAT COMPARED LOW INTENSITY STRETCHING WHICH THEY CALL MICRO STRETCHING THEY USED A CAPITAL M S I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS THAT IT'S PROPRIETORY ALTHUGH I DIDN'T SEE EVIDENCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BUT THEY ALL IT MICRO STRETCHING BUT TO BE VERY CLEAR MICRO STRETCHING IN THE CASE OF THIS MANUSCRIPT IS LOW INTENSITY STRETCHING AND THE COMPARED THAT WITH MODERATE INTENSITY STATIC STRETCHING ON AN ACTIVE IN PASSIVE RANGES OF MOTION I CAS TO THEIR LOW DIFFERENT VARIABLES ARE HERE BUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW THAT THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY MOST RELEVANT TO US AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE TAKE AWAY AT THE OUTSET AND THEN RETURN TO IT AT THE END SO THAT A IF I LOSE ANY F YOURS ATTENTION IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES AT LEAST YOU HAVE A THAT KEY TAKE AWAY BASILY WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT A SIX WEEK TRAINING PROGRAMM USING VERY LOW INTENSITY STRETCHING HAD A GREATER POSITIVE EFFECT ON LOWER LIMB RANGE OF MOTION THENDED MODERATE INTENSITY STATIC STRETCHING I FIND THAT INCREDIBLY INTERESTING SO VERY LOW INTENSITY AND WILL DEFIND WHAT THAT MEANS IN A MOMENT HERE 'M QUOTING THEM THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE STUDY WAS THE GREAT R INCREASE IN ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION COMPARED TO PASSIVE RANGE OF MOTION BY THE MICRO STRETCHING GROUP SO THIS RELATES TO WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKIN ABOUT A FEW MOMENTS AGO AS IT RELATES TO THE ANDERSON METHOD WHICH IS THAT VERY LOW INTENSITY STRETCHING MEANING EFFORT THAT FEELS NOT PAINFUL AND IN FACT MIGHTY FEEL EASY OR AT LEAST NOT STRAINING TO EXCEED A GIVEN RANGE OF MOTION TURNS OUT TO NOT JUST BE AS AFFECTIVE BUT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MODERATE INTENSITY STRETCHING SO WHAT IS LOW INTENSITY STATIC STRETCHING WELL THEY DEFINE THIS AS THE STRETCHES WERE COMPLETED AT AN INTENSITY OF THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT WHERE A HUNDRED PERCENT EQUALS THE POINT OF PAIN RIGHT SO THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT IN THESE INDIVIDUALS AN AGAIN ON PARAPHRASING INDUCED A RELAXED STATE WITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE SPECIFIC MUSCLE AND HERE THEY WERE HOLDING THESE STATIC STRETCHES I SHOULD MENTION FOR ONE MINUTE NOT THIRTY SECONDS NOW THE CONTROL GROUP WAS DOING THE EXACT SAME OVER ALL PROTOCAL SO DAILY STRETCHING FOR SIX WEEKS THE SAME EXERCISES HOLDING EACH SET FOR SIXTY SECONDS BUT WE'RE USING AN INTENSITY OF STRETCH OF EIGHTY PER CENT WHERE AGAIN A HUNDRED REPRESENS THE POINT OF PAIN THE POINT WHERE THE PERSON WOULD WANT TO STOP STRETCHING I FIND THESE DAT INCREDIBLY INTERESTING FOR I THINK WHAT OUGHT TO BE OBVIOUS REASONS IF YOUARE GOING TO EMBARK ON A FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING TRAINING PROGRAMME YOU DON'T NEED TO PUSH TO THE POINT OF PAIN IN FACT IT SEEMS THAT EVEN JUST APPROACHING THE POINT OF PAIN IS GOING TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN OPERATING AT THIS THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT OF INTENSITY PRIOR TO REACHING THAT PAIN THRESHOLD THE PAIN THRESHOLD BEING A HUNDR PER CENT NOWOF COURSE THIS IS PRETTY SUBJECTIVE BUT I THINK ALL OF US SHOULD BE ABLE TO REGISTER WITHIN OURSELVES SO WHETHER A GIVEN RANGE OF MOTION OR EXTENDING A GIVEN RANGE OF MOTION BRINGS US TO THAT THRESHOLD OF PAIN OR NEAR PAIN AND ACCORDING TO THIS STUDY AT LEAST OPERATING OR PERFORMING STRETCHING AT INTENSITY THAT'S QUITE LOW THAT'S VERY RELAXING TURNS OUT TO BE MORE BENEFICIAL IN INCREASING RANGE OF MOTION THAN IS DOING EXERCISES AIMED AT INCREASING RANGE OF MOTION AT A HIGHER INTENSITY OCASE SO LOWER INTENSITY STRETCHING I SHOULD SAY LOWER INTENSITY STATIC STRETCHING APPEARS TO BE THE MOST BENEFICIAL WAY TO APPROACH STRETCHING AND I THINK THAT'S A RELIEF A PROBABLY TO MANY OF US BECAUSE IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE INJURY RISK IS GOING TO BE LOWER THAN IF ONE WERE PUSHING INTO THE PAINSONE SO TO SPEAK THE AUTHORS OFFER A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHY THIS APPROACH THIS MICRO STRETCHING APPROACH MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE OM HERE ON PARAPHRASING FROM THEIR DISCUSSION WHERE THEY MENTION THAT IT COULD BE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THEY HAD IMPROVED RECIPROCAL INIBITION WITHIN THE HAMPSTERING MUSCLE GROUP SO THIS GETS RIGHT BACK TO THE SORTS OF NORL MECHANISMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THAT SOMEHOW BY DOING THIS LOW INTENSITY STRETCHING THAT THEY W RE ABLE TO ACCESS SOME OF THOSE SPINDLE AND GE TIO TYPE MECHANISMS THAT WE REFERRING TO O EARLIER AND THE INIBITION OF HAMSTRING AND QUADRICT OF STRETCHES THEY ALSO OFFER A NUMBER DIFFERENT A IDEAS ABOUT HOW THIS COULD SHIFT THE ACTIVATION OF THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC REMEMBER THE CON OF STRESS DIVISION OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND TO REDUCE THAT RELATIVE TO ACTIVATION OF THE PARIS SYMPATHETIC ARM OR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I CONFESS THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF ARGUMENTS AROUND SYMPATHETIC PARI SYMPATHETIC THAT SOMEWHAT CONVOLUTED I WILL JUST IN FAIRNESS TO THE NUROU SCIENCE ON THOSE SYSTEMS OM I WOULDN'T SUGGEST A PUTTING TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THEIR ARGUMENTS ABOUT SYMPATHETIC AND PARI SYMPATHETIC OT TO MY MIND THEY DIDN'T REALLY A HOLD MUCH WATER BUT ITHERE I'M NOT TRYING TO BE DISPARAGING OF THE OF THE OVER ALL WORK WHICH I THINK IS REALLY QUITE SOUND WHICH IS THAT LOW INTENSITY SO CALLED MICRO STRETCHING IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO INCREASE LIM RANGE OF MOVEMENT OVERTIME I WANTED JUST BRIEFLY RETURN TO THIS IDEA OF WHETHER NOT TO DO BOLISTIC OR STATIC STRETCHING BEFORE SOME SORT OF SKILL TRAINING OR WEIGHT TRAINING OR ANY KIND OF SPORT OR EVEN CARTER OF ASCLA EXERCISE LIKE RUNNING AGAIN THE DATE ARE REALLY SPLIT OUT THERE THERE ARE EVEN FOLKS WHO SUGGEST THAT DOING ANY KIND OF STRETCHING PRIOR TO RUNNING IS GOING TO LOWER RUNNING EFFICIENCY IT'S GO N TO REQUIRE SENTUALLY MORE WORK AND MORE OXYGEN UPTAKE AT A GIVEN SPEED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND RUNNERS AND THAT COMMUNITY ARGUE ABOUT THIS ENDLESSLY THEIR PAPERS IN BOTH SIDES AND BOTH DIRECTIONS I'M SURE I'LL HEREABOUT SOME OF THES IN THE COMMENTS I'M NOT REALLY GOING TO TAKE A STANCE ON THIS AS AS A CONSEQUENTS BECAUSE THE DATE ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE HOWEVER I THINK THERE'S A GENERAL LOGIC THAT WE CAN APPLY AND HEAR I'M BORROWING FROM SOME CONVERSATIONS AND SOME INFORMATION PUT OUT THEREBY DOCTOR ANDY GALPAN WHOM I THINK UM IS OF COURSE BOTH AN EXPERT AND THINKS ABOUT THESE THINGS IN ARE REALLY SOUND IN FLEXIBLE WAY NOPON INTENDED THERE ARE INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT WANT TO DO SOME STATIC STRETCHING TO INCREASE LIMB RANGE OF MOTION PRIOR TO DOING WEIGHT TRAINING EVEN IF IT'S GOING TO INHIBIT THAT PERSONS ABILITY TO LIFT AS MUCH WEIGHT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT WELL FOR INSTANCE IF SOMEBODY HAS A TIGHTNESS OR A LIMITATION IN THEIR NEURO MUSCULAR CONNECTIVE TISSUE SYSTEM SOME PLACE IN THEIR BODY AND SYSTEM THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM USING PROPER FORM THAT THEY CAN OVERCOME BY DOING SOME STATIC STRETCHING WELL THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA AS DOCTOR GALPAN POINTS OUT OR FOR INSTANCE IF PROPER STABILITY WITHIN THE MOVEMENT REQUIRES INCREASING LIMB RANGE OF MOTION IN SOME WAY WELL THEN COMPROMISING THE USE OF GREATER LOADS A COULD BE GREATLY OFFSET BY DOING SOME STATIC STRETCHING TO IMPROVE A HAMSTERING FLEXIBILITY OR ANOTHER MUSCLE GROUP FLEXIBILITY SO WE CAN'T ALWAYS THINK ABOUT JUST WHAT'S GOING TO ALLOW US OR INHIBIT US FROM USING THE MAXIMAL AMOUNT OF WEIGHT OR FROM RUNNING AS FAR AS WE WANT TO RUN AS FAST AS WE WANT TO RUN THERE ARE INSTANCES WH R PEOPLE ARE TRYI TO OVERCOME INJURIES WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO COME BACK FROM A REPARATIVE SURGERY OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT COMING BACK FROM A LAY OFF WHERE SOME ADDITIONAL STATIC STRETCHING PRIOR TO CARTY OF ASCULAR WEIGHT TRAINING OR SKILL TRAINIG OR SPORT OF SOME KIND IS GOING TO BE USEFUL BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO PUT US IN A POSITION OF GREATER SAFETY AND CONFIDENCE AND PERFORMANCE OVER ALL EVEN IF ITS ADJUSTING DOWN OUR SPEED OR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LOADS THAT WE USE SO IT'S YOU THAT NEEDS TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT FOR YOU AND WITHIN A GIVEN TRAINING SESSION YOU WANT TO DO STATIC TRAINING I SHOULD SAY STATIC STRETCHING RANGE OMOTION TRAINING PRIOR TO OR AFTER THAT TRAINING SESSION AND SIMILARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA POINT IN THE FACT THAT DOING SOME DYNAMIC OR EVEN BULISTIC STRETCHING PRIOR TO SKILL TRAINING OR CARDY OFASCULAR WEIGHT TRAINING CAN BE BENEFICIAL IMPART TO WARM UP THE RELEVANT NARAL CIRCUITS JOINTS IN CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND MUSCLES AND AS WELL TO PERHAPS IN PROVE RANGE OF MOTION OR ABILITY TO PERFORM THOSE MOVEMENTS MORE ACCURATELY WITH MORE STABILITY AND THEREFORE WITH MORE CONFIDENCE AND WHILE DOCTOR ANDIGALPIN WOULD NEVER NAME ANY PROTOCAL AFTER HIMSELF IS FAR TOO HUMBLE TO DO THAT I'VE NAMED HA COUPLE OF PROTOCALS AFTER HIM PARTICULAR THE GALPAN EQUATION FOR HYDRATION BECAUSE HE WAS WILLING TO STICK HIS NECKOUT THERE AND PUT DOWN SOME SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT PEOPLE COULD FOLLOW IN ORDER TO INSURE PROPER HYDRATION DURING TRAINING YOU CAN LOOK UP THE GALPAN EQUATION ELSEWHERE HOG JUST GUGALITER IL LOOK ELSEWHERE YOU'LL FIND IT AND DOCTOR GALPAN HAS ALSO BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL AN GENEROUS AND I THINK VERY ACCURATE IN OFFERING A KIND OF A GENERAL ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC FOR HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE GOALS OF A POTRIC PARTICULAR TRAINING SESSION AND THEREBY TO DECIDE WHETHER NOT YOU'RE GING TO DO BULISTIC OR STATIC STRATCHAIN AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO WE CAN REFER TO THIS GENERAL APPROACH AS GALPINEAN GALPINIAN THAT RIGHT GALPIN EAN LOGIC GALPANIAN LOGIC THUS FAR WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT STRETCHING FOR SAKE OF INCREASING LIMFLEXIBILITY AND RANGE OF MOTION BUT THERE ARE OTHER REASONS PERHAPS TO EMBARK ON A STRETCHING PROTOCALL THAT INCLUDE BOTH OUR ABILITY TO RELAX AN ACCESS DEP RELAXATION QUICKLY AS WELL AS EVEN TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND PERHAPS EVEN COMBAT CERTAIN FORMS OF CANCER AND IF THAT SOUNDS REALLY FAR FETCHED WHEN EMPHASIZE THAT THE STUDY UM ABOUT TO SHARE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT SECTHALY CARRIED OUT BY ONE OF THE DIRECTORS OF A DIVISION OF THE NATUONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND THIS WAS THE WORK OF HELLING LANGAVEN WHOSE A MEDICAL DOCTOR HAS DONE REALLY IMPORTANT WORK ON THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THINGS LIKE ACCUPUNCTURE AND HAS APPROACHED ALL THAT FROM A VERY MECHANISTIC VIEWPOINT RIGHTS AND NOT LOOKING JUST AT THE EFFECTS OF AC O PUNCTION BUT REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SORTS OF SITA KINDS IN FLAMMATORY A MOLECULES AN PATHWAYS ARE ACTIVATED WHAT SORTS OF NURAL MECHANISMS GET ENGAGED BY THINGS LIKE ACUPUNCTURE THAT IMPINGES ON THE FASHAL TISSUES AND SO FORTH AND DOCTOR LANGAVANIS OCCURRENTLY A DIRECTOR OF THE NATINAL INSTITUTES OF CONCOMPLIMENTARY HEALTH UM AND MEDICINE AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH SO THIS IS A MAJOR DIVISION SUPPORTED BY TAXDOLLARS THAT SUPPORT SYSTEMATIC MECHANISTIC EXPLORATION OF THINGS LIKE RESPIRATION MEDITATION YEOGA ACUPUNCTURE THIS A SERIOUS SCIENCE APPLIED TO PROTOCALS AND APPROACHES THAT BEEN UCE FOR SOME PERIAT OF TIME BUT REALLY AIMED AT TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD THE BEST PROTOCALS BE TO EVOLVE NEW PROTOCOLS SO THRE'S A REALLY INTERESTING STUDY DONE INANIMAL MODELS BUT I THINK IT'S A POWERFUL ENOUGH RESULT THAT I THINK WE ALSHA PAY ATTENTION TO IT THAT TITLE OF THIS PAPER AND AGAIN THE LAST AUTHOR IS  DOCTOR LANGAVIN HERSELT IS STRETCHING REDUCES TUMOR GROWTH IN A MOUSE BREASTCANTS OR MODEL AND YES YOU CAN GET MICE TO STRETCH IT TURNS OUT THAT A IF YOU GENTLLY LIFT UP MICE BY THEIR TAIL AND THAT HOLD ON TO THEIR CAGE THERE'S A IS A WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN MECHANICALLY STRETCHD THEM IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HARM THEM FIRST I SHOULD MENTION THAT DOCTOR LANGAVIN AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT JUST A BRIEF WHOLE BODY STRETCH OF THAT SORT INDUCES AN INCREASE IN ACTIVATION OF THE PARIS SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AGAIN NOT ARM LIMB ARM BUT THE ASPECT OF THE AUTONOMIC ER SYSTEM THAT CREATES A WHOLE BODY WHOLE NERVOUS SYSTEM SHIFT TOWARD MORE RELAXATION SO YES INDEED STRETCHING INDUCES RELAXATION AT A SYSTEMIC LEVEL NOTCHUS AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT PROBABLY NOT SURPRISING TO THOSE OF YOU THAT USE STRETCHING REGULARLY BUT YES IT DOES INDEED RELAXUS YES YOU CAN DO THIS IN MICE AND SEE THAT IN MICE AS WELL HERE'S WHAT THEY DID FOR THIS CURRENT STUDY I SHOULD SAY THIS WAS A STUDY PUBLISHIN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN SCIENTIFIC REPORTS THEY RIGHT RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT GENTLE DAILY STRETCHING FOR TEN MINUTES CAN REDUCE LOCAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE INFLAMMATION IN FIBROSIS NOW THAT'S LOCAL TISSUE INFLAMMATION AND FIBROSIS AS WELL WE NOW KNOW AS SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND CAN INDUCE RELAXATION SYSTEMICALLY IN THIS CASE THEY FOCUST ON MICE NOT HUMANS AND MICE WERRANDOMIZED TO A STRETCH VERSISNO STRETCHE CONDITION AND WERE TREATED FOR TEN MINUTES ONCE A DAY FOR FOUR WEEKS SO ITS TEN MINUTES OF THIS PASSIVE WHOLEBODY STRETCHING A DAY FOR FOUR WEEKS WHAT'S REMARKABLE I MEAN JUST I AVE TO SAY IS JUST STRIKING IS THAT TUMOR VOLUME IN THESE MICES THEY WERE ABLE TO INDUCE TUMORS IN THESE MICE AND THAT TUMOR VOLUME AT THE END POINT WAS FIFTY TWO PER CENT SMALLER IN THE STRETCH GROUP COMPARED TO THE NO STRETCH GROUP THIS IS A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT AND THEY POINT OUT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY OTHER TREATMENT AND THEY EXPLORED WHETHER NO UTSIDEOR TOCKS COMMUNE RESPONSE IS WEREACTIVATED AND ON A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET TOO DEEPLY INTO THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS BUT THIS IS PRETTY REMARKABLE EVEN THREE WEEKS INTO THIS STRETCHING PROTOCAL THIS DAILY STRETCHING PROTOCAL FOR THESE MICE TUMOR VOLUME WAS REDUCED I M BY YOU NOW IT'S ALMOST HAVED THIS IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE SO THEY HAVE THESE MEASURES OF TUMOR VOLUME A AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THESE ANIMALS WERE WERE TREATED AND HANDLED WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS DAILY STRETCH I FIND THIS RESULT TO BE OF COURSE LIMITED IN THE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S DONE IN AN ANIMAL MOEL NOT IN HUMANS WE HAVE TO POINT IT OUT BUT AS THEY POINT OUT IN THEIR DISCUSSION OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A FIFTY TWO PER CENT REDUCTION AND MEMORY TUMOR GROWTH O OVER ONE MONTH IN MICE UNDERGOING STRETCHING FOR TEN MINUTE TO DAY WITHOUT ANY OTHER FORM OF THERAPY DO THEY THINK THAT STRETCHING ITSELF IS CHANGING THE TUMOR SIZE NO IN FACT THEY RAISE THE POSSIBILITY THAT STRETCHING BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACT ON THE FAHIA MIGHT EVEN CREATE MICHO ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE MORE PERMISSIVE FOR TUMOR GROWTH IN CERTAIN INSTANCES SO THEY'RE CAREFUL TO EMPHASIZE WHAT I ALSO BELIEVE TO BE THE CASE WHICH IS THAT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE STRETCHING ITSELF WAS DIRECTLY ACTING TO REDUCE TUMOR SIZE BUT RATHER THAT THEREIS THIS POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN INFLAMMATION AN IMMUNE EXHAUSTION MECHANISMS THAT IF YOU CAN PERIODICALLY RELAX A NERVOUS SYSTEM YOUARE THROUGH STRETCHING THAT IT CAN EFFECT CERTAIN PATHWAYS RELATED TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW THE UMION SYSTEM TO COMBAT TUMOR GROWTH TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE SO AGAIN EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A STUDY IN MICE IT ARGUES THAT RELAXATION INDUCED BY STRETCHING CAN HAVE A POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON MEMORY TUMOR GROWTH AGAIN A HUGE EFFECT A CARRIED OUT BY A ONE OF THE PROMER LABS AND INDIVIDUALS A WHO DO THIS SORT OF WORK IN THINK ABOUT THE SORT OF THING AND OF COURSE I WONT TO POINT OUT IT WASN'T JUST DOCTOR LANGAVAN THAT DID THE STUDY THEIR NUMBER OF COAUTHORS ON THE STUDY WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE COAUTHORS A ESCUSE ME WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDY SO THE CAN PERUSIT IN MORE DETAIL IF YOU LIKE NOW AS A RELATED AND SOMEWHAT FINAL POINT I LIKE TO RETURN THIS TO THIS IDEA IN THIS PLACE THIS REAL ESTATE WITHIN OUR BRAIN THAT WE CALL THE INSULER CUARTEC THE INSULA THEU RECALL WAYBACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS EPISODE WEE TINED BY THE VON ECONOMO NURANS THAT CONSTANTINE VONICONOMO THE AUSTRIAN A SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE AND PERFORM INTERPRETATIONS OF OUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE PAIN OUR DEDICATION TO A PRACTICE FOR INSTANCE WHETHER NOT WE ARE IN PAIN BECAUSE ITS A PRACTICE THAT WE ARE DOING INTENTIONALLY AN WANT TO IMPROVE OURSELVES OR WHETHER NOT ITS PAIN THAT'S ARRIVING THROUGH SOME EXTERNALLY IMPOSED A DEMANDS OR SITUATION WELL THE INSOLAS HANDLING ALL THAT AND FORTUNATELY THERE'S A WONDERFUL PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IS A FEW YEARS AGO NOW O IN THE JOURNAL CEREBRAL QUARTEX WHICH IS A FINE JOURNAL US IS THE EAR TWENTY FOURTEEN INTITLED INSOLAR QUARTEX MEDIATES INCREASE PAIN TOLERANCE IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS I'LL TELYUAE LIKE THE STUDY I'M PERSONALLY NOT A PRACTITIONER OF YOG HVE TAKEN A FEW YOGA CLASSES OVER THE EARS HAVE DONE SOME OF THE HOT YOGA CLASSES A THOSE ROOMS CAN GET REALLY REALLY WARM I CONFESS O AND I'VE DONE THE CONSTANDARD YOGA EVERY NOW AND AGAIN T'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I'VE KEPT EPT REGULARLY A THIS STUDY EXPLORED A THE EFFECTS ON BRAIN STRUCTURE VOLUME IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND FOR THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE THAT ARE FICINATOS AN YOGA THEY THEY PULLED SUBJECTS FROM HAVING BACKGROUNDS IN THE HERE I'M PROBLIGANAMIS PRONOUNCED THESE DIFFERENT THINGS IN FOR FORGIVE ME THE VINYASA YOGAS THE OSHTANGA YOGAS THE YONGAR YOGAS E SENANDA YOGAS HUGESO SOME PEOPLE WERE NEW TO THESE PRACTICES SOMEWHERE A EXPERIENCED THET THE IMPORTANT TAKE AWAYS WERE THAT THEY TOOK THESE YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND THEY DIDN'T EXPLORE THEIR BRAINSTRUCTURE IN THE CONTEXTS OF YOGA ITSELF THEY LOOKED AT THINGS LIKE PAINTOLERANCE SO THEY USED THURMAL STIMULATION BASELY THEY PUT PEOPLE INTO CONDITIONS WHERE THEY GAVE THEM VERY HOT OR VERY COLD STIMUALLY AND COMPARED THOSE YOGA PRACTITIONERS OF VARYING LEVELS OF YOGAEXPERIENCE TO THOSE THAT HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH YOGA SO CALL CONTROLS AND THEY FOUND SOME REALLY INTERESTING THINGS ARE A LOT OF DATAAN THIS PAPER BUT HERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE PAINTOLERANCE OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS WAS DOUBLE OR MORE TO THAT OF NON YOGA PRACTITIONERS EVEN FOR THOSE THAT WEREN'T DOING THE SOCA HATYOGA RIGHT THEY ALSO FOUND THAT PAIN TOLERANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER BOTH FOR HEAT PAIN AND FOR COLD PAIN THEY ALSO FOUND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN INSULER AGAIN THE INSULA THIS BRAIN REGION GRAY MATTER VOLUME TYPICALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GRAY MATTER WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SO CALED SELL BODIES THE O THE THE LOCATION IN NURANS WHERE THE JENOMAS HOUSE AND WHERE THE ALL THE HOUSEKEEPING STUFF IS THERE AND THEN WHITE MATTER VOLUME TENDS TO BE THE AXONS THE WIRES BECAUSE THEIR INSHEATHED WITH THIS STUFF THAT APPEARS WHITE IN EMOREYES AND INDEED IS WHITE UNDER THE MYCICROSCOPE AND INDEED IS WHITE AS ACUALLY LIPID WHICH IS MILIN SO INCREASE GRAY MATTER VOLUME OF THE INSULA IS A SIGNIFICANT FINDING A BECAUSE WHAT IT SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING YOGA HAVE AN INCREASE VOLUME OF THESE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THEIR ASSOCIATED WITH INTERACEPTIVE AWARENESS AND FOR BEING ABLE TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT PAIN AND WHY ONE IS EXPERIENCING PAIN NOT JUST TO LEAN AWAY FROM PAIN BUT TO UTILIZE OR LEVERAGE OR EVEN OVER COMO PAIN SO THER MANY STUDIES OF YOGA AN MEDITATION OUT THERE FEW THAT HAVE AS MUCH MECHANISTIC DETAIL AS THIS ONE AND IN FACT THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL FIGURE FIGURE THREE IN THIS PAPER THAT SHOWS THAT THE GRAY MATTER VOLUME OF THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN REGION SCALES IN ALMOST LINEAR WAY WITH THE DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE THAT SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TAKING ON IN YEARS SO PEOPLE THAT HAD THEY HAD A FEW SUBJECTS THATVE UP TO FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS OF YOGA PRACTICE HAD MUCH L PURTURE A LEFT INSOLAR GRAY MATTER VOLUME BIGGER BRAINAREAS ASSOCIATE WITH THESE ABILITIES AND I FIND THIS INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES OUT THERE THAT DON'T CREATE THESE KIND OF CHANGES IN BRAIN VOLUME IS ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE INSOLA SO IT APPEARS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE PERFORMANCE OF THE YOG MOVEMENTS BUT THE OVERCOMING ORE THE KIND OF PUSHING INTO THE END RANGES OF MOTION AND TO PUSH THROUGH DESCOMFORT TO SOME EXTENT OF COURSE WE WANT PEOPLE DO THAT IN A IN A HEALTHY SAFEWAY BUT THAT'S ALLOWS YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO BUILD UP THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THESE BRAINARIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO COPE WITH PAIN BETTER THAN OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND TO COPE WITH OTHER KINDS OF INTERRECEPTIVE CHALLENGES IF YOU WILL I NOT JUST PAIN BUT COLD A NOT JUST PAIN BUT DISCOMFORT OF BEING IN A PARTICULAR POSITION TO DO THAT AND AGAIN WE WOULDNT WANT PEOPLE PLACING THEMSELVES INTO A COMPROMISED POSITION LITERALLY THAT WOULD HARM THEM ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT EARLIER WE HEARD THAT MICROSTRETCHING OF THE KIND OF NON PAINFUL SORT LOINTENSY SORTS ASTION CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR INCREASING AND RANGE OF MOTION BUT THIS STUDY REALLY EMPHASIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA DON'T JUST LEARN MOVEMENTS THEY LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN WAYS THAT REALLY RESHAPES THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO PAIN TO FLEXIBILITY AND TO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THE NUR MUSCULAR SYSTEM WAS DESIGND TO DO AND AS A FINAL POINT THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL GRAPH IN THIS PAPER BEAUTIFULI THING BECAUSE IT EXPLORE SOME OF THE MORE SUBJECTIVE DIMENSIONS OF YOGA AND INSOLAR FUNCTION WHICH IS A HERE A'LL READ IT OUT IN THE NURTY A FORM AND THEN ALL EXPLAIN WHAT IT MEANS THIS IS A FREQUENCY HISTOGRAM OF CATEGORIES OF MENTAL STRAGIES USED BY YOGES VERSIS CONTROLS DURING THE COLD PAIN TOLERANCE TASK WHAT THEIR DESCRIBING HERE IN SHOWING IS QUANTITATIVELY HOW PEOPLE ARE CONCEPTIALIZING COLD PAIN IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH IT AND THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ARE FOR INSTANCE DESTRACTION RIHT SOME PEOPLE JUST CHOOSE TO DISTRACT THEMSELVES FROM PAIN OR TO ATTEMPT TO OTHER PEOPLE TRY TO IGNORE IT LOT LIKE DISTRACTION BUT NONE THE LESS TO ENGAGE IN A NEGATIVE EMOTION SORT OF LIKE U LIKE A ONDIG OMINABEAN RESISTANCE TO THIS CONTROL SUBJECTS TENDED TO USE THOSE APPROACHES WHEREAS PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA TENDED TO USE OTHER SORTS OF SUBJECTIVE APPROACHES LIKE POSITIVE IMAGERY TOSOME EXTENT THE ABILITY TO RELAX DESPITE THE EXTREME COLD THE ABILITY TO QUOTE AND CQOE EXCEPT LIKE THIS IS JUST HAPPENING DESPITE THE EXTREME COLD TO OBSERVE TO THIRD PERSON THEMSELVES AND THE GREATEST EFFECT OF COURSE WAS TO BREATHE TO FOCUS ON THEIR RESPIRATION AS A WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS CHALLENGE THIS COLD CHALLENGE NOW ALL OF THAT IS SUBARE SUBJECTIVE DATA BUT I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THE PRACTITIONERS OF YEOGA ARE NOT JUST USING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MENTAL STRATEGIES BUT THEY ARE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AT DEALING WITH PAIN THEIR PAIN TOLERANCE IS MUCH HIGHER AS EVIDENCE BY THE OTHER DATA IN THE PREVIOUS GRAFTS IN THE PAPER SO WELL THIS POTCES EPISODE IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT ABOUT YEOGA PERSAY IT'S ABOUT FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING FLEXIBILITY IN STRETCHING ARE ELEMENTS WITHIN YEOGI PRACTICES AND OF COURSE YOOGET PRACTICES INVOLVE BREATHING AND MENTAL WORK AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS BALANCE ET CETERA TTE VAST LANDSCAPE AS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW BUT I THINK THAT IF EVER THERE WAS A MANUSCRIPT THAT POINTED TO THE UTILITY OF SOMETHING LIKE YEOGA FORSAKE OF TAPPING INTO A PARTICULAR SET OF BRAIN CIRCUITS AND MECHANISMS THAT COULD WICK OUT INTO MULTIBLE TO MENSIONS OF LIFE SO DAY TO DAY LIFE STRESS CHALLENGES IN DEALING WITH ALL SORTS OF EXTERNAL STRESSERS CAREER RELATED FAMILY RELATED A RELATIONALLY AT ET CETERA ET CETERA ESCUSE ME BUT AS WELL FOR INCREASING RANGE OF MOTION FOR INCREASING FLEXIBILITY SO IF EVER THERE WAS A PRACTICE THAT ONE COULD EMBARK ON THAT WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE FLEXIBILITY IND LIMBRANGE OF MOTION BUT WOULD ALSO ALLOW ONE TO CULTIVATE SOME IMPROVED MENTAL FUNCTIONING AS IT RELATES TO PAIN TOLERANCE AND OTHER FEATURES OF STRESS MANAGEMENT THAT NO DOUBT WICK OUT INTO OTHER AIORS OF LIFE FEARS THAT YEOGA IS A QUITE USEFUL PRACTICE AND SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN INCREASING LIMB RANGE OF MOTION AND YOUR ALREADY OR PRACTITIONER OF YEOGA GREAT I CAN IMAGINE THAT SOME DAY THERE'LL BE ANOTHER STUDY LIKE THIS ONE AND YOU'LL BE IN THAT OF YOU KNOW TEN OR FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN YEAR  PRACTITIONER A GRAFT YOU'LL BE THAT DOT WAY OUT ON THE FAR END OF OF THE GRAFT THAT SHOWS THAT YOUR INSULA IS THAT MUCH BIGGER THAN THE REST OF OURS O AND THEREFORE YOUR INTERNAL AWARENESS AND PAIN THRESHOLDS AND STRETS MANAGEMENT WILL BE THAT MUCH BETTER BUT OF COURSE YOGA ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO INCREASE LIM RANGE OF MOTION AND FLEXIBILITY UP UNTIL NOW WE'VE DESCRIBED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT AND WE'VE ARRIVED AT SOME GENERAL THEMES AND PROTOCOLS AGAIN THOSE THEMES AND PROTOCOLS WILL BE DISTILLED INTO SOME SPECIFIC AND PRECISE LIST IN OUR NORAL NETWORK NEWS LETTER BUT WE CAN REVISIT A COUPLE OF THEM NOW JUST IN SUMMERY AND SYNTHESIS STATIC STRETCHING APPEARS TO BE AT LEAST AMONG THE MORE USEFUL FORMS OF STRETCHING SO LOW OR ZEROMAMENTUM STRETCHING TYPICALLY AT AND RANGE OF MOTION I LOVE THIS CONCEPT OF MICROS STRETCHING EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF STUDIES THAT HAVE ADDRESSED WHETHER NOT HIGH INTENSYAR LOW INTENSY STATIC STRETCH HOLDS ARE MORE BENEFICIAL THE IDEA AND INDEED THE DATA THAT LOW INTENSITY SO THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT OF A OF WHAT WOULD ONE WOULD CONSIDER PAINFUL APPEARS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EIGHTY PER CENT OF THAT THRESHOLD FIND THAT INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND THEN THERE'S THIS IDEA OF FREQUENCY IT REALLY DOES APPEAR THE GETTING AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES PER WEAK TO OL OF STRETCHING FOR A GIVEN MUSCLE GROUP IS IMPORTANT FOR CREATING MEANINGFUL LASTING CHANGES IN LIMB RANGE OF MOTION AND THAT IS BEST ACHIEVED BY FIVE DAY A WEEK OR SIX DAY A WEEK OR EVEN SIT SEVEN DAY WE PROTOCOLS BUT THOSE CAN BE VERY SHORT PROTOCOLS LIMITED TO SAY THREE SETS OF THIRTY MAY BE INFORTY FIVE OR SIXTY SECOND S OF STATIC COLD ALTHOUGH THIRTY SECONDS SEEMS TO BE A KEY THRESHOLD THERE OM THAT CAN GET YOU MAXIMUM BENEFIT THERE IS NO NEED TO DO FULL SIXTY SECOND HOLDS UNLESS YOU ARE DOING FEWER TOTAL SESSIONS PER WEEK AND OF COURSE TO ALWAYS WARM UP OR TO ARRIVE AT THE STRETCHING SESSION WARM AND THEN OF COURSE THERE ARE THE OTHER FORMS OF STRETCHING THAT WE TOUCHED UPON A BIT O THINGS LIKE PIANEUF AND WE TALKED ABOUT WY PIANEF WORKS THINGS LIKE THE SPINDLE AND THE GULD GY TENDENT ORGAN REFLECES THAT ARE BUILT INTO ALL OF US THAT WE ARRIVE IN THIS WORLD WITH ND OF COURSE THE OTHER FORMS OF STRETCHING THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND IMPORTANT SUCH AS DYNAMIC AND BOLISTIC STRETCHING AGAIN STRETCHING PROTOCOLS THAT INVOLVE A LOT OF MOMENTUM IN ORDER TO IMPROVE RANGE OF MOTION FOR PERFORMANCE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF WORK THAT ONE IS ABOUT TO EMBARK ON TYPICALLY THAT WOIULD BE PHYSICAL WORK BUT A WHOLE INTERESTING AND UNEXPLORED LANDSCAPE IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHANGING LIMB RANGE OF MOTION AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF BODY MOVEMENT ACTUALLY SHAPE ARE COGNIVABILITIES AND THAT WILL BE THE TOPIC OF A FUTURE EPISODE OF THIS PODCAST IF YOURE LEARNING FROM MEND OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBED OUR UTUBE CHANNEL THAT'S A TERRIFIC ZEROCOS UAY TO SUPPORT US IN ADDITION PLEASE SUBSCRIBED OUR PODCAST ON SPOTIFY AND APPLE AND AT BOTH SPOTIFY AN APPLE YOU CAN LEAVE US UP TO A FIVE STAR REVIEW IF YOU HAVE FEED BACK SUCH AS COMMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THIS OR OTHER EPISODES OR Y HAVE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT TOPICS THAT YOU LIKE US TO EXPLORE ON THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAS'S OR GUESTS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO INTERVIEW PLEASE PUT THOSE IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOU TO THATS THE BEST PLACE FOR US TO FIND THEM WE DO READ THEM ALL AND WE DO TAKE THEM INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN BUILDING OUT FUTURE PROGRAMMING PLEASE ALSO CHICK OUT THE SPONSORS MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF TO DAYS EPISODE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THIS PODCAST NOT SO MUCH ON TO DAY'S EPISODE BUT IN MANY EPISODES OF THE HUBERAN LABPODCAST WE TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS WHILE SUPPLEMENTS AREN'T NECESSARY FOR EVERYBODY MANY PEOPLE DERIVE TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FROM THEM FOR THINGS LIKE IMPROVING THE TRANSITION TIME AND DEPTH OF SLEEP OR FOR IMPROVING FOCUS OR FOR VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING THINGS LIKE ANXIETY MANAGEMENT FOR THAT REASON THE HUBERMAN LADPODCAST HAS DECIDE TO PARTNER WITH MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS FIRST OF ALL MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS ARE OF THE VERY HIGHEST QUALITY THERE USE RIAT VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL SPORT STEAMS AND THEY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH VARIOUS GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS EXPLORING THE ROLE OF PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENTS IN HUMAN PERFORMANCE SECOND OF ALL THEY SHIP INTERNATIONALLY BECAUSE WE KNOW A NUMBER OF YOUR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY OF THE UNITED STATES WE HOPE THAT WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU AS WELL WE WANTED TO HAVE A SINGLE LOCATION WHERE PEOPLE COULD GO TO ACCESS THE MOST OFTEN DISCUST SUPPLEMENTS HERE ON THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST SO WHILE THE FULL CATALO G OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTS ISN'T QUITE AVAILABLE YET MANY OF THEM ARE AVAILABLE YOU CAN FIND THEM BY GOING TO LIVEMOMENTOS TOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN AGAIN THAT'S LIVEMOMENTOS THOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO FIND SUPPLEMENTS FOR SLEEP FOR RECOVERY FROM EXERCISE FOR FOCUS AND MANY OTHER FEATURES THAT IMPACT MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY FOLLOWING HUBERMAN LAB ON INSTEGRAM AND TWITTER PLEASE DO SO AT BOTH PLACES I DESCRIBE SCIENCE AND SIGNCE RELATED TOOLS THAT RELATE TO SOME OF THE THEMES COVERED HERE ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST BUT OFTENTIMES I'LL DO POST THAT INCLUDE INFORMATION AND TOOLS NOT DETAILED HERE ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST WE ALSO HAVING NEWS LETTER I'VE MENTIONE THIS A FEW TIMES DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE IT IS THE NEURAL NETWORK NEWS LETTER YOU CAN ACCESS THAT NEWS LETTER COMPLETELY ZERO OF COST BY GOING TO HUBERMAN LAB DOT CALM GO TO THE MENU AND SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWS LETTER YOU SUPPLY YOUR EMAIL WE DOE NOT SHARE YOUR EMAL WITH ANYBODY ELSE WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR PRIVACY POLICY THAT YOU CAN FIND THERE IF YOU WANTOS THE EXAMPLES OF PREVIOUS NEWS LETTERS CAN FIND THEM THERE WITHOUT HAVING TO SIGN UP AGAIN THAT NURL NETWORK NEWS LETTER COMES OUT ABOUT ONCE A MONTH AND WE USE IT TO DISTILL OUT ESSENTIAL PROTOCALS FROM THE PODCAST TO SYNTHESIZE INFORMATION FROM THE PODCAST WE DO BELIEVE MANY PEOPLE FIND THEM USEFUL SO SIGN UP FOR THE NURAL NETWORK NEWS LETTER IF YOU'RE INTERESTED SO THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR JOINING ME TO DAY FOR A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEURAL AND NEURO MUSCULAR AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND SKELETAL ASPECTS OF FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING AND AS ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR INTERESTINCE

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LADPONCAS A SCIENCE  SCIENCE SPACE TO NE I MENDEUR HUBERMEN AND O'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AN OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING DOCTOR CREG HELLER AS MY GUEST ON THE HUBERMAN LAD POTCAST DOCTOR HELLER IS A PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY AND NEURO SCIENCES AT STAMFORD HIS LABORATORY WORKS ON A RANGE OF TOPICS INCLUDING THERMAL REGULATION DOWN CYNDRUM AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS TODAY WE TALK ABOUT THERMAL REGULATION HOW THE BODY HEATS AND COOLS ITSELF AND MAINTAINS WHAT WE CALL HOMEOSTASIS WHICH IS AN EQUILIBRIUM OF PROCESSIES THAT KEEPS OUR NURON'S HEALTHHY OR ORGANS FUNCTIONING WELL AND AS DOCTOR HELLER TEACHES US THERMAL REGULATION CAN BE LEVERAGE IN ORDER TO GREATLY INCREASE OUR PERFORMANCE IN ATHLETICS AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE AS WELL LEARNING TO CONTROL YOUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE IS ONE OF THE MOST IF NOT VEMOST POWERFUL THING THAT YOU CAN DO TO OPTIMIZE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE REGARDLESS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOUARE IN HE ALSO DISPELS MANY COMMON MYTHS ABOUT HEATING AND COOLING THE BODY INCLUDING THE IDEA THAT PUTTING A COLD PACK ON YOUR HEAD OR NECK IS THE OPTIBLE WAY TO COOL DOWN QUICKLY IN FACT AS DOCTOR HELLER TELLS US IT ACTIALL CAN BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AND LEAD TO HYPER THERMIA IT'S A FASCINATING CONVERSATION FROM WHICH I LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NEW INFORMATION AND WE DIDN'T EVEN GET IN TO THE OTHER INCREDIBLY INTERESTING WORK THAT DOCTOR HELLER DOES ON DOWN CNDRUM AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND SLEEP ITS WE HOPE TO HAVE HIM BACK IN THE FUTURE TO DISCUST THOSE TOPICS AS YOU'LL SOON SEE DOCTOR HELLER IS A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE ON ALL THINGS HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY BIOLOGY AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE IT'S NO SURPRISE THEN THAT HE'S BEE CHAIR OF THE BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT STAMFORD FOR MANY YEARS AS WELL AS DIRECTOR OF THE HUMAN BIOLOGY PROGRAM SIF YOUR INTERESTED IN HUMAN BIOLOGY AND HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE IN ANY CONTEXT OR SETTING ATHLETIC OR OTHERWISE I THINK YOU'LL VERY MUCH ENDOY TO DAY'S CONVERSATION BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE T EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCINCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMAN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SON DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POTCAST THEREREASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OURE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSERTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMG RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT OR BRAIN AND BODY WITH OUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIO IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER HEYLL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THEREARE TON OF DATAND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WO'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN INVITEMEND THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CAROVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PETASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS POD CAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR CRAG HELLER GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE GOOD TO BE HERE PATSITS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING I KNOW THAT I AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF COLD SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEND IN RECENT YEARS IS THAT FOR MANY REASONS PEOPLE HAVE BECOME INTERESTED IN THINGS LIKE TAKING COLD SHOWERS AND TAKING ICE BATHS FOR MANY DIFFERENT PURPOSES YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THIS IS INTRODUCE AS JUST A GENERAL HEALTH TONIC YOU KNOW BUT OTHER TIMES PEOPLE GET SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW IT CAN IMPROVE RAZILIAN  OR IT CAN IMPROVE ONE'S METABOLISM COULD YOU JUST TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I GET INTO A COLD SHOWER WERE AN ICE BATH WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BASIC RESPONSES AT THE LEVEL OF METABOLISM OVASY PSYCHOLOGICALLY WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IT'LL VERY FROM PERSON OF PERSON BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I SUBMERGE MYSELF INTO AN ICE BATH IF I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU GET A TREMENDOUS SHOCK AND WHAT THAT'S GOING TO TRANSLATE INTO IS A BIT OF A SHOT OF A DRENALIN AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY THE SO CALLED BENEFIT BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT A BENEFIT OF THE CRYO CHAMBERS YOU GO INTO A CRIOT CHAMBER AND IT'S A SHOCKS ORU GET A SHOT OF A DRENALAN SO SURE YOU GAN TO FEEL DIFFERENT WHEN YOU COME OUT YOU'VE GAT A SHOT OF A DRENNALAN BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO ANY BENEFIT IN TERMS OF YOUR PHYSIOLOGY YOUR PERFORMANCE AND SO FORTH NOW IF YOU TAKE A COL BATH OR COLD SHOWER A COUPLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING ONE IS YOU'RE GOING TO STIMULATE VAZO CONSTRICTION SO IF ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOUR BODY TO GET RID OF HEAT BECAUSE YOU ARE SHUTTING OFF YOUR AVENUES OF HEAT LOSS IF YOU'RE IN A TRUE COLD BATH THE OVER ALL SURFACE ARY OF YOUR BODY IS SO GREAT THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU VASSAR CONSTRICTED YOU'RE STILL GOING TO LOOSE HEAT OQE SO UM SO VEZIR CONSTRICTION THE CONSTRICTION OF IS IT CAPLERIES VESSELS AND ARTERIES ALL CONSTRICT OR JUST ONE OR TO WELL THIS IS AN AREA OF CONTROVERSY IN GENERAL WHEN PEOPLE TALK OF AS OF CONSTRICTION THEY TALK OF THE OVER ALL SKIN SURFACE AND THAT IS NOT TRUE THE PRIMARY SITES OF HEAT LOSS WHICH WE ARE GOING TO GET INTO ARE THE PALMS OF YOUR HANDS THE SOULS OF YOUR FEAT AND THE UPPER PART OF YOUR FACE AND THE REASON THESE ARE AVENUES FOR HEAT LOSS IS THERE UNDERLAN BY SPECIAL BLOOD VESSELS AND THESE BLOOD VESSELS ARE ABLE TO SHUNT THE BLOOD FROM THE ARTERIES WHICH COMING FROM THE HEART DIRECTLY TO THE VEINS WHICH ARE RETURNING TO THE HEART AND BY PASSING THE CAPIALARIES WHICH ARE THE NEUTRITIVE VESSELS BUT HIGH RESISTANCE SO YOU CAN TELL WHEN YOU SHAKE SOME ONE'S HAND WHAT HIS ARE HER THERMAL STATUSES THE HANDS HOT OR ITS COLD YEELING THATS AN ARD OF THE REASON WHY HUMANS EVOLVED THIS PRACTICE OF A SHAKING HAND ASSESSING EACH OTHER'S LEVEL OF ANXIETY WE ALL KNOW THAT A LIMP HANDSHAKE IS PRETTY A INDICATIVE OF SOMETHING AND A FIRM HAND SHAKE IS INDICATIVES OF SOMETHING AS IS THE CRUSHING HAND SHAKE FOR THAT MATTER I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN OF HANDSHAKING IS OFHER THAN TO GET YOUR HAND AWAY FROM YOUR WEAPON PERHAPS LIHE BUT COUPLIC QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GET INTO THE SPECIALIZED A A VASCULAR COMPARTMENTS ON THE SOULS THA PALMS AND AND THE UPPER FACE A YOU MENTION WHOL BODY IMMERSION LIKE INTO AN ICE BATH OR VERY COLD WATER UP TO THE NECK VERSIS A COLD SHOWER IS IT IS THERE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE TWO BESIDES THE FACT THAT THEY BOTH PROVIDE THI RELEASE OF A DRENALIN IS THERE ANYTHING THAT'S THAT REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE EVOKED BY BY COLD SHOWER VERSES IMMERSION IN COLD WELL THERE ARE DIFFERENCES THAT ARE MORE PHYSICAL THAN ANYTHING ELSE SO IF YOU ARE IN A COLD BATH AND YOU'RE STILL YOU DEVELOP A BOUNDARY LAYER IF YOU'RE IN A SHOWER YOU CAN'T DEVELOP A BOUNDARY IKD YOU EXPLAIN WHN THE BOUNDARY LAYERS YES AIF YOU IT'S BEST TO EXPLAIN IT IN TERMS OF A HOT BATH WAS EVERYBODY'S EXPERIENCE THAT YOU GET INTO A HOT BATH AND O MY GOD IT'S REALLY HOT ALMOST PAINFUL AND THEN YOU SIT DOWN AND EVENTUALLY IT DOESN'T FEEL SO HOT ANY MORE BECAUSE THE STILL WATER WHICH IS CLOSE TO YOUR SKIN IS COMING INTO EQUILIBRIUM WITH YOUR SKIN SO IT'S LIKE HAVING A BLANKET ON YOU OR AN INSULATOR ON YOU AND THEN IF YOU MOVE AROUND YOU DISTURB THAT STILL WATER LAYER YOU FEEL THE HOT TEMPERATURE AGAIN I SEE SO IF I WERE TO GET INTO A COLD ICE BATH OR VERY COLD RETA BODY OF WATER OF SOME KIND AND STAY STILL I'D LIKELY FEEL WARMER AT LEAST UNTIL I CER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOSING AS MUCH HEAT I SEE RIND THEN WHEN I M MOVE LAL AROUND O FLAIL AROUND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE MARTY GOT IT BUT I THINK GETTING BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION ABOUT BENEFITS A YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AEROBIC ACTIVITY OR ANEROBIC ACTIVITY IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO PERFORMANCE AND EXERCISE AND SO FORTH SO IF YOU'RE DOING AROBIC ACTIVITY THAT YOU CAN SUSTAIN FOR A LONG TIME YOUR PRODUCTION OF HEAT IS RISING GRADUALLY AND IS BEING DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY SO EVENTUALLY YOUR BODY TEMPERATUREIS GOING TO COME UP TO A LEVEL THAT'S GOING TO IMPAIR YOUR PERFORMANCE SO THE BENEFIT OF A COLD BATH OR A COLD SHOWER BEFORE AEROIC ACTIVITY IS YOU INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF YOUR BODY MASS TO ABSORB THAT EXCESS HEAT I SE SO COULD YOU SAY THAT ON IN A IN A ROUGH SENSE THAT A PRO TO CALL THAT ONE MIGHT USE IF THEY CON A HEAD OUT FOR A A LONG RUN EVEN ON A REASONABLY WARM DAY NOT NOT SUPER HOT ONE MAYBE IT IS SUPER HOT WOULD BE TO TAKE A COOL SHOWER BEFORE THEY GO RUN WOULD THAT BE BENEFIT SHORE IT'LL TAKE THEM LONGER TO GET TO THE SWEAT POINT AND TO HEAT UP AND WHAT WILL THAT TRANSLATE YOU IN TERMS OF A PRET WORM YOU INCREASE YOUR WELL COULD INCREASE YOUR SPEED OR DEPENDS ON HOW YOU USE THAT BENEFIT SOME PEOPLE ARE PACERS THEY WILL GO AT THE SAME PACE AND THEN THEY WILL GO FARTHER OR SOME PEOPLE ARE A WHAT IS A PACERS AND REGULATORS AND AND NO PACERS OR FORCERS THEY WILL TAKE THAT ADVANTAGE AND USE IT UP AS FAST AS THEY CAN SO THEY WILL GO FASTER BUT NOT NECESSARILY FARTHER I SEE AS FAR AS I KNOW NOT MANY ATHLEADS AT LEAST NOTHONES THAT I KNOW ARE GETTING INTO COOL BODIES WATER TAKING COLD SHOWERS BEFORE THEY HAD OUT TO TRAIN BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE CO BE A REAL PERFORMANCE BENEFIT THERE IT COULD BE A BENEFIT I KNOW AR WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OUR TECKNOWLEDGE IT FOR COOLING BUT AAT ONE POINT AR I DON'T KNOW F THEY'RE USING IT NOW BUT ARE CROSS COUNTRY TEAM WHEN THEY WOULD GO TO COMPETE IN A VERY HOT PLACE THEY WOULD DO THEIR WARM UP EXERCISES THEY'RE STRETCHING THEN THEY WOULD EXTRACT HEAT BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE RACE SO THEY I LIKE TO THINK OF IT IS YOU HAVE GREATER SCOPE FOR HEAT ABSORPTION INTERESTING ABOUT HOW LONG A WOULD ONE NEED TO TAKE ONE OF THESE SHOWERS ARE COLD IMMERSIONS BE FOREHEADING OUT FOR RUN ROUGHLY SPEAKING WE DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO DETAILS BECAUSE EVERYONE'S PERFORMANCE LEVEL AND REGIMENT AS CAN BE DIFFERENT WHERE THEY LIVE AS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT ET CETERA IT'S NOT AS LONG AS YOU THINK IT'S MINUTES COUPLE MINUTES YET FOR BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS A AS YOUR COUR TEMPERATURE GOES DOWN YOU WILL EVENTUALLY SHUT OFF YOUR HEAT LOSS AND THAT HEAPS IT FROM GOING BELOW NORMAL SO YOU CAN IF YOURE IF YOUE WARMED UP AND YOUR TEMPERATURE HAS RISEN BY HALF A DEGREE LET SAY I DOESN'T TAKE MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES TO EXTRACT THAT HEAT IF YOUR VASSO DILATED INTERESTING AND WHAT ABOUT FOR THE ANEROBIC ATHLE THE STRENGTH ATRIGHT FOR THE ANEROPIC ATHLE AND LET'S SAY THEY'RE DOING SEVERAL SEVERAL THEY'RE DOING SEVERAL SETS AAND HOW MANY REPS WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING  THEY'RE COUR TEMPERATURE SNOUPH ON ARISE AT FAST BECAUSE IT'S ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES WHICH ARE BEING USED BUT THE TEMPERATURE OF THOSE MUSCLES WILL GO UP SO IT'S A LOCAL EFFECT IT'S A LOCAL EFFECT RY SO LETAY LET'S FORSAKE OF TO DAY OF MADE FOR THIS DISCUSSION LESS IF WE ASSUME THAT THE A BASIC WORK OUT EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE DO VARIATION ON THIS IS YOU KNOW FIVE SETS OF FIVE OR TEN SETS OF TEN SO FOR THOSE LISTENING IT WOULD BE O FIVE SETS OF TEN A FIVE RAP REPETITIONS OR TEN SETS OF TEN REPETITIONS TEN BY TEN FIVE BIVE FIVE NO SO IF SOMEBODY LETS AY IS DOING A A LARGE BODY COMPOUND MOVEMENT LIKE BARBELL SQUOTS WHERE THERE THEY'RE LOT OF LARGE BODY MOVEMENTS HIPPINGING IN ETS ET CETERA A BUT FOR INSTANCE THE THE BISEPS ARE NOT THEY'RE INVOLVED BUT MORE LESS INDIRECTLY RIGHT SO THE FACT IS GOING TO BE TO HEAT UP THE QUADRSEPS HEAT UP THE HAND STRINGS HEAT UP THE GLUTS THIS CON O THING RIGHT I SEE AND THEN DURING REST THAT HEAT WILL LEAVE THE MUSCEL BUT IT'S NOT FAST AND CERTAINLY THE HEAT CAN'T LEAVE THE MUSCLE VERY FAST WHILE YOU'RE WORKING OUT BECAUSE WHEN THE MUSCLE CONTRACTS IT SQUEEZES THE BLOOD VESSELS AND THE ONLY WAY HEAT GETS OUT OF A MUSCLE IS IN THE BLOOD AND YOUR MUSCLE METABOLISM CAN GO UP FIFTY OR SIXTY FOLD DURING ANEROBIC ACTIVITY THAT MEANS THE HEAT PRODUCTION IN THE MUSCLE GOES UP FIFTY OR SIXTY FOLD THE BLOOD FLOW TO THAT MUSCLE CANNOT GO UP FIFTY OR SIXTY FOL SO YOU LITERALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO COOK YOUR MUSCLES SO COM THIS IS PROBABLY IN PROPERY TIME TIS A MENTION BRIEFLY WHAT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF THIS IS COULD YOU JUST WWE WIRE RETURN TO THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT ONE CAN DO TO MITIGATE THIS HEATING UP BUT AM COULD UJUSIC PLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENERGY PRODUCTION A T P AND PIRUVATE KINNES AND THE ROLE OF HEAT THERE SURE AM WE DON'T GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING SO LIKE A STEAM ENGINE MOST OF THE ENERGY IN OUR FOOD IS LOST AS HEAT SO WE ARE ROUGHLY ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT OF FICIENT SO OF THE ENERGY THAT WE TAKE IN IN OUR FOOD ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT OF THAT CAN GO INTO DOING WORK AND THE REST OF IT IS LOST IS HEAT NOW WE'RE MAMALS WE USE THAT HEAT TO KEEP OUR BODY TEMPERATURE CONSIDERABLY ABOVE THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IF YOU RAISE BODY TEMPERATURE A FEW DEGREES HIGHER YOU'RE IN TROUBLE THAT'S HYPERTHERMIA SO INDIVIDUAL MUSCLES CAN REACH HYPEROTHERMIC LIMITS BEFORE YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE IT IN THE WHOLE BODY SO TO KEEP YOU FROM DAMAGING YOUR MUSCLE BY HYPERTHERMIA WE HAVE FAILSAFE MECHANISMS AND ONE OF THOSE FAILSAFE MECHANISMS IS AN ENDSIME WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR GETTING FUEL NOTHER WORDS THE RESULTS OF METABOLISM OF GLUCOS GETTING THAT FUEL INTO THE MITOCONDRIA WHICH IS MAKING OUR MAJOR COINAGE OF ENERGY EXCHANGE E T P SO THAT PARTICULAR ENSIME IS TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE SO WHEN THE MUSCLE TEMPERATURE GETS ABOVE THIRTY NINE OR THIRTY AND FIVE IT SHUTS OFF AND THAT ESSENTIALLY SHUTS OFF THE FUEL SUPPLY TO THE MITOCONDRIA THAT'S WHEN YOU CANNOT DO ONE MORE WRECK SO F YOU MAILURE COULD WE SAY THAT MUSCL ONE N ONE COMPONENT O MUSCULAR FAILURE IS OVER HEATING OF THE MUSSITE LOCALLY REI PROBA THE OTHER THINGS TOO A WELL IF YOU AFT YOU LACK OXYGEN BUT OUR OXYGEN DELIVERY IS PRETTY GOOD TO THE TO TO THE MUSCLE IF YOU RUN OUT OF LUCOS YA THAT'S GOING TO IMPAIR YOU BUT THE MOST IMMEDIATE THE MOST IMMEDIATE IMPAIRMENT OF MUSCLE ACTIVITY MUSCLE FATIGUE IN OTHER WORDS IS THE RISE IN TEMPERATURE OF THE MUSCLE AM I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW THAT MUSCLE FAILS LOCALLY BUT I'V THIS BURNING QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT I CANNOT SEEM TO ANSWER FOR MYSELF I'M HOPING YOU CAN ANSWER T FOR ME SO ET SAY I'M DOING A FIVE SETS OF FIVE WITH SQUATS I HIT MUSCULAR FAILURE AT A GIVEN WEIGHT AND ACCORDING TO WHAT I NOW KNOW IT'S MY QUADRSAPS AND THE MUSCLES ASSOCIATED MEN WITH THE SQUAT THAT IFE FAILE BECAUSE OF THIS HEAT TRIGGERING THIS MECHANISM TRUGGER BY HEAT THAT SHUTS OFF THE MUSCLE BUT MY BISEPS ARE NICE AND COOEL ERE TELL ME THEY'RE AT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT DOING TOO MUCH WORK IT'S ONLY INDIRECT WORKSO WHY IS IT THAT I CAN'T SET THES THE BAR DOWN IN THE SQUAT RAT WALK OVER AND DO BARBELL CURLS WITH THE SAME INTENSITY THAT I COULD IF I WERE TO DO THOSE BARBELL CURNELS FRESH WE HAD NOT HAVING DONE ANYTHING PRIOR WELL YOU WILL STILL HAVE A FATIGUE CURVE WITH THE EARTH UPPER BODY AND THAT WILL BE INFLUENCED BY ANY RISING TEMPERATURE THAT HAS BEEN GENERATED BY YOUR LOWER BODY EXERCISE SO SO TEMPERATURE IN BOTH CASES IS THE LIMITING FACTOR IT'S WR ONE A LIMITING FACTOR IT'S ONE LIMITING I FIND THAT AMAZING I FIND THEN AMAZING BECAUS I ALWAYS THOUGHT NAIVELY THAT THE REASON MUSCLES FAIL IS BECAUSE WE QUOTE DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO ANOTHER REPETITION THOUWHET IT'S THE YOU LACK LIKEAGIN OR SOME ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT GLIKAGEN BUT OF COURSE WE STILL HAVE GLAKAGEN O IT'S NIVY FOR ME TO THINK THAT BECAUSE IF I WAIT THREE MINUTESAN GO BACK I CAN DO THOSE REPETITION R GAN SO THE GLIKEAGEN WASN'T RESTORED IN THAT THREE MINUTES RI OBVIOUSLY IT WAS THERE RIGHT SO I REALIZE THERE MIGHT BE OTHER MECHANISMS INVOLVED SOUNDS LIKE HEAT IS IF NOT THE DOMINANT MECHANISM THAT PREVENTS MORE WORK IT'S ONE OF THEM IT'S ONE OF THEM AND IT'S OF QUICK ONE IT'S A FAST ONE SO IT CAN HAPPEN WITH LETS SAY YOU ARE A REALLY EXPERIENCED WEIGHT LIFTOR YOU MAY BE DOING VERY VERY HIGHWAIGHTS WITH SETS OF FIVE OR SIX YET TO BE CLEAR FOR THE AUDIENCE I'M NOT DOING VERY HIGHWAYS NOT PARTICULARLY STRAI'D NOT SUPERWEEK BILE NOT PARTICUARLY STRONG BUT CREGS REFERRING IN THE GENERAL SENSE TOO IT TO YOU SO IT WHY WHY IS IT THAT IF I FINISH A SET OF SQUATS I CAN'T SIMPLY COOL OFF MY QUADRACEPS BY THROWING A NICE COOL TOWEL ON MY QUADRICEPS WHY WOULD WISE THAT NOT THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOUR BODY SURFACE IS A VERY GOOD INSULATOR CAY WE WE THINK WE DON'T HAVE FUR AND THEREFORE WERE NOT INSULATED BUT THE SKIN THE FASHA THE THETHE MUSCLES UNDER LEATH UNDERNEATH THAT THERE ALL VERY GOOD INSULATORS AND THAT'S WHY I SAID EARLIER THAT THE WAY THE HEAT GETS OUT OF THE MUSCLE IS IN THE BLOOD SO I WANT A STEP THROUGH A COUPLE OTHER PORTALS BY WHICH ONE MIGHT THINK THAT HEATING AND COOLING WOULD BE IDEAL AND THEN GET BACK TO THES SURE SPECIAL ICE SURFACES ON THTHE HANDS THE FEET IN THE FACE SO IF THROWING A COL TOWEL OR ICE EVEN ICE COL TOWEL ON MY QUADRICEPS ISN'T GIN A WORK ARE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE FAN BECAUSE I'M INSULATED FROM THAT COOL I CAN'T COOL OFF MY BLOOD FAST ENOUGH WHAT ABOUT DRINKING SIXTEEN OUNCES OF ICE WATER ISURE YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN CALCULATE HOW MUCH HEAT THAT CAN ABSORB AND YOU CAN'T CONTINUE DRINKING LEADERS OF ICE WATER YOU'RE GOING TO DILUTE YOUR YOU'RE BLOOD AND HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS BUT YES IT'LL HELP SURE IT WILL HELP BUT IT IS NOT DOESN'T HAVE THE THE FULL CAPACITY YOU WILL NEED WHAT ABOUT AN ICE PACK TO THE BACK OF MY NECK OR TO MY HEAD R OSAZING THE COLD SPONGE OVER THE HEAD IM I'M DELIBERATELY MOVING THROUGH THESE OPTIONS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WE SEE MOST OFT AND WEWERE ACTUAL JUST WATCHING THE OLYMPIC TRACK AND FEELD TRAL YET LAST NIGHT APINORE AGAIN I'M A HUGE TRACK AND FIELD FAN AND OM THERE WERE LOT OF I THERE WERE LOT OF PONGES ON THE BACKS OF NACKS AM BEFORE AND BETWEEN AND AFTER EVENTS AND AM HOW GOOD IS THAT OR HOW POOR IS THAT AS A STRATEGY SINCE NOW WE KNOW THAT BEING OVER HEATED LOCALLY AND SYSTEMICALLY THROUGHOUT THE BODY IS IS A SERIOUS LIMITING FACTOR ON PERFORMANCE BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT OUR THERMA REGULATORY SYSTEM WE HAVE A THERMASTAT JUST LIKE YOU HAVE A THERMASTAT IN YOUR HOUSE AND THAT THERMASTAT IS IN THE BRAIN EH DO WE KNOW THE SPECIFIC SIDE YES YES IT'S CALLED THE PREOPTIC ANTERIOR HYPOTHALEMUS IT DOES MANY THINGS IN TERMS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL REGULATION BUT IT SERVES AS A THERMASTAT NOW THAT THERMASTAT HAS TO HAVE INFORMATION IT HAS TO HAVE IN PUT WHERE DOES THAT THEN PUT COME FROM IT COMES FROM OUR OVER ALL BODY SURFACE WHERE WE SENT TEMPERATURE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE OVER HEATED IS THAT YOU CAN SEND IN A COLD STIMULUS TO YOUR THERMASTAT AND THAT SORT OF LIKE WUNNING TO COOL YOUR HOUSE BY PUTTING A WET WASHCLOTH OVER YOUR THERMASTAT NO IT'S IT'S DOING THE WRONG THING SO WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD EXPERIENCES WHERE WE'VE HAD PEOPLE EXERCISING GETTING OVER HEATED AND THEN COOLING THE BODY SURFACE AND THEY SAY I FEELS GRAT THIS IS FANTASTIC AND THEIR COUR TEMPERATURES GOING OUT I THINK THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR SOI WAT I I WAS WEAND IN A LABORATORY WHERE THERE WERE ALWAYS BATTLES OVER THE TEMPERATURE IN THE LANDSO PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS PUTTING ICE TACKS ON THERMISTATS SOR PUTTING FANDS TOWARDS THERMISTATS AND TRYING TO PLAY THIS GAME GOOD TO KNOW WE WERE ALL BEING FOOLISH AM YOUVEN THOUGH WERE NERBIL JUST M PUTTING A COLD TAWEL OVER MY TORSO WE'RE PUTTING ICE ON THE BACK OF  MY UPPER BACK YOU'RE SAYING COULD ACTUALLY HEAT UP MY COR IT IT AT LEAST DECREASE YOUR HEAT LOSS YOUR RATE OF HEAT LOSS AS WORKE YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE YES SOU A LITTLE LATER II KNOW AND THAT IS AR NATURAL PORTALS FOR HEAT LOSS SO YOU CAN THINK OF THE NATURAL PORTERS PORTALS FOR HEAT LOSS AS OUR AIR CONDITIONERS EH THE THERMASTATS IN THE BRAIN AND THE INFORMATION FROM THE THERMIS TO THE THERMASTAT IS COMING FROM THE OVER ALL BODY SURFACE SO WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF YOU LET'S SAY COOL THE TORSO WITH AN ICE TASS YOU CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE VAZO CONSTRICTION OF YOUR PORTALS YOURE HEAT LOST PORTALS SO THAT'S WHAT IMPAIRS THE RATE AT WHICH YOURE LOSING AIN'T FEELS GOOD NOW BACK TO THE HEAD THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THE MAJOR BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN COMES UP FOUR ARTERIES THROUGH THE NECK A THEREIS THE CORRODED ARTERIES IN THERE'S THE RTEPRAL ARTERIES SO WHEN YOU PUT A COLD TOWEL AROUND THE NECK YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING A COLD STIMULUS INTO THE BRAIN WELL THAT'S GREAT FOR PROTECTING THE BRAIN YOU WONAT PROTECT THE BRAIN BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL COOLER THAN YOU ARE SO YOU WILL THINK YOU'RE READY TO GO AGAIN QUICKLY WHEN YOU'VE JUST ESSENTIALLY A COOLED THE THERMASTAT UM THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT AND THERE'S A LOT OF UM INTEREST NOWDAYS AND PEOPLE DOING MARITHONS AND TEARE EVEN SOM YEY'LL DO THESE ALTRAS ALTERA ROUNDING WHICH I GESS IS EVERYTHING LONGER THAN A MARITHON AND GO AND GO LASTMAN STANDING LAST MAN LAST WOMAN STANDING KIND OF THINGS SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IF SOMEBODY'S HYERTHERMIC THEY COULD TRICK THEMSELVES INTO SUBJECTIVELY THINKING THAT THEY ARE COOLING OFF BUT I COUNT GO CROSAL AND THAT THEY CAN GO FURTHER BUT THEIR BRAIN COULD COOK WELL IF THEY STOP THE COOLING THEN THAT HOT BLOOD FROM THE BODY CORS GOING TO GO TO THE BRAIN INTERESTING WELL MANY A IT'S A BIT OF A OF A TANSION BUT MANY PEOPLE REPORT AFTER LONG BOUTS OF EXERCISE OR EVEN JUST VERY INTENSE BOUTS OF EXERCISE FEELING A KIND OF BRAIN FOG OR MENTAL FATIGUE I I ASSUME T AT THAT WAS DUE TO LOWERED BRAIN OXYGENATION POST EXERCISE BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE'S SOME POST EXERCISE OFFECTS ON HEATING AND COOLING OF THE BRAIN THAT MIGHT IMPACT COGNITION OR I SHOULD SAY NEGATIVELY IMPAT COGNITION IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A ARISING TEMPERATURE DECREASES COGNITIVE CAPACITY YOU CAN EXPERENCE AT YOURSELF YOU GET WONT A TRADEMILL THEY WOULD FOLLOW YOUR TEMPERATURE AND THEN JUST DO A SIMPLE ACTIVITY LIKE ADDING IN SUBTRACTING YOU GET TO ABOUT THIRTY NINE DEGREES YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANY MORE YOU CAN'T JUST CALCULATE HELLA HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN ON THE TRADMILL SO THAT THE PHRASE COOL COMMON COLLECTED IS  COM CACT THAT'S THE GULL IN IN ALL PURSUITS ESTRIGHT SO UM I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE PORTALS ECAUSEYOU'VE MENTION THEM A FEW TIMES BEFORE I ASK ABOUT WHAT THE PORTALS ARE EXACTLY AND HOW THEY WORK AND HOW THEY CAN BE LAVISH FOR PERFORMANCE I JUST THERE'S A QUESTION THAT MI NEUROBIOLOGISELF CAN'T RESIST BUT ASK WE HAVE THIS THERMASTAT N THE PREOPTICAREA OF THE HYPOTHALMIS WHICH IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT PREOT THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREAS ALSO ONE THAT'S KNOWN TO BE A SECUALLY DIMORPHIC DEPENDENT ON TESTOSTERONE EXPOSURE EARLY IN LIFE OR ET CETERA ALTHOUGH AM PEOPLE SHOULD JUST NOTE THAT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY TESTOSTERONE THAT CREATES THESE SEXTUAL DIMORPHISMS THESE DIFFERENCE IS ACTUALLY TESTOSTERON CONVERTED INTO ESTEROGEN A THIT' SECTULLY ESTEROGEN IS THE EFFACTOR A WHICH IS FASCINATING NONE THE LESS WE'VE GOT THIS AREA THAT DACTS IS A THRMASTAT AND YOU SAID IT'S COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM THE WHOLE BODY DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE ARE PATHWAYS AS THE NERAL SCIENTISTS LIKE YOU YOU AND I REFER TO THEM AS THESE THESE AFFERENT OR INPUT PATHWAYS FROM THE BODY TO THE PREOPTIC AREA IS THERE A MAP OF OUR BODY IN THE PREOPTICARIA CAUSE THAT YET I HAVE TO M AGINE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION JUST COMING FROM THE LEFT SHOULDER JUST FROM THE RIGHT TO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED A PRETTY PROBABLY A PRETTY CRUDE MAP BUT THAT YOU NEED A COMPLETE MAP OF THE BODY SURFACE THEREWHAT YOU DON'T NEED A COMPLETE MAP IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS MEAN THAT THERMAL AFFERANT INFORMATION YOU MENTION IT ALSO GOES TO THE SYMADISAN'S RY CORTEXS SO YOU KNOW IF AN ICE CUBE HAS TOUCHED YOU ON THE BACK BUT THAT DOESN'T NES SARELY TRANSLATE INTO A CHANGE IN LETS SAY YOU'RE SHIVERING OR OR SWEATING SO THE INFORMATION IT'S GOING TO THE HYPOTHALYMUS IS MORE INTEGRATED REPRESENTATION OF OF BODY TEMPERATURE SO IT SORT OF AN AVERAGE OF WHAT'S IS AN ASSTE LOGI SO IF I WERE TO LET SAY I GET HOT ON A HOT DAY AND A POSICLES WHEN WE ARE SOMMER CAN YET AND WEN TO A SPORTS CAMP AND YOUARE HERE ACTUALLY AND WE RUN AROUND LIKE CRAZY N THAN WE GET INTO THE SHADE IF WE COULD BUT WEARE YOU KNO POPSICLES RAINFARUCLES ORE KIDS WERE PUTTING ICE CUBES DOWN EACH OTHER A YOU KNOW SHERTS OR SOMTHAN A BUT THAT'S AN AVERAGE BECAUSE OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY AREN'T EXPOSE THE MOUTH IS EXPOSED TO THE ICE IN THE POPSICAL CASE ARE THE THE COLD CUBES ARE IN THE HANDS AS YOU SAID IT FEELS REALLY GOOD IT FEELS OBUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT ITS FEELS DECEPTIVELY GOOD BECAUSE IN REALITY IT STILL BE QUITE WARM INTERNALLY ABSOLUTELY YE YERSTON YET YOU CAN FEEL GREAT AND HAVE A DANGEROUSLY HYPEROTHERMIC TEMPERATURE BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE DANGERS O THINGS GET BADFAST WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT PEOPLE COULD BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FOR HYPERH TOR MEA ESENTIALLY IT'S IT'S ALMOST IRONIC THAT IF INDIVIDUALS ARE TRANSFOR TRANSSITIONING INTO HEAT STROKE THEY ACTUALLY VAZO CONSTRICT AND THEY STOP SWEATING AND THAT'S A PATHOLOGICAL SITUATION I I COULDN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN IT BUT ESSENTIALLY YOU ARE JUST FEELING EXHAUSTED YOUR FEELING A MISERABLE A THE HEART RATE IS VERY HIGH YOUR HEART RATE GOES UP AS YOUR COUR TEMPERATURE GOES UP ACALLED CARTIAC DRIFT SO YOU JUST FEEL ROTTEN BUT THAT'S WHY SINCE SINCE IT'S NOT AN IT'S NOT A DANGER SIGNAL HAT YOU CAN TRANSLATE IMMEDIATELY INTO DO I'M GOING INTO HEAT STROKE THAT'S WHY PEOPLE CAN OVERCOME THEIR BAD FEELING WITH MOTIVATION TO CONTINUE GOING TO WORK HARDER SO THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF HY PROFILE ATHLETIC DEATHS DO TO HEAT STROKE THAT WERE DORING PRACTICE NOT COMPETITION WHEN PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE REALLY TRYING TO BUT IN PRACTICE WHICH SHOWS THEY WERE JUST MOTIVATED TO PUSH SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE MAGNIFICENT PORTALS THAT NOT JUST HUMANS BUT OTHER ANIMALS MAMMELS ARE EQUIPPED REATH SO IM IF PUTTING COLD ON THE NECK OR ON THE HEAD OR ON THE TORSO IS NOT OPTIMAL IM WHAT IS OPTIMOL AND I MAYBE WALK US THROUGH A THURY AS TO WHY WE WOULD HAVE THESE PORTALS LOCATED WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW ONE MIGHT LEVERAGE THEM FOR PERFORMANCE  WHERE THE PORTALS ARE ARE IN THE GLABERAUS SKIN BIG WORD KA GLABOROUS JUST MEANS NO HAIR SO IT'S THE HAIRLESS SKIN YOU SAY WELL I'M  MOST OF MY BODY IS WITHOUT HAIR NO YOUR MOST YOUR BODY HAS HAIR FOLICALS WE ARE MAMELS MAMMELS HAVE FUR WE'VE LOST THE FR BUT WE STILL HAVE THOSE THAT HAIRY SKIN FENA TYPE ALL OVER OUR BODY EXCEPT EXCEPT FOR THOSE SKIN SURFACES WHERE ARE MAMMAL RELATIVES DIDN'T HAVE FUR SO THE PADS OF THE FEET AND FOR THE PRIMATES APR PART OF THE FACE FOR RABBITS NO PORTIONS OF THE EARS THE INNER SURFACE NONERS FOR BEARS AND OF THE TONGUE BARS HAVE BIG TONGUES FUGETUNGS AN DON KNOW THAT EITHER AND IN THACLASS THE AMARIA A  WICKING MATCH WITH A BRN THE NIA SO ANYWAY AM OUR MAMMAOPMEMALIAN RELATIVES CANT LOSE HEAT OVER THEIR OVER ALL BODY SURFACE SO PROBABLY VERY EARLY ON AND MEMELION EVOLUTION THEY EVOLVED THESE SPECIAL BLOOD VESSELS IN THE LIMITED SURFACE AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE FUR AND AS I SAID WHAT THESE BLOOD VESSELS ARE ARE SHUNTS BETWEEN THE ARTERIES IN THE VEINS ARTERIES IN VEINS ARE BOTH LOW RESISTANCE VESSELS SO YOU CAN HAVE HIGH FLOW RATE CAPILARIES WHICH NORMALLY ARE BETWEEN ARTERIES IN VEINS ARE HIGH RESISTANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY TINY IS IT IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IM WHAT I WAS TAUGHT IS THAT BLOOD FLOWS FLUNT FROM ARTERIES THEN TO CAPALARIES AND THEN TO VEINS AGAN ACK TO THE HEART SO IT SORT OF LIKE FROM THE HEART THROUGH ARTERIES THEN THROUGH THESE LITTLE CAPALARIES WHICH ELIKE LITTLE LESSTOARIES AND STREAMS AND THEN TO THE VEINS BACK TO THE HEART IS THAT IS THAT GENERALLY ANA LUTLY TO WHAT I LEARN IN BASIC PHYSIOLOGIIS STILL STILL I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T GET AN AG IN YOUR CLASS NO MAYBE A THE EERS THE BUT NOT ENOUGH A THAT'S EXCELLENT O GAND SO YOU'RE SAYING IN THIS GLABYROUS OR BENEATH THE GLABYRA SKIN THERE ARE THESE SHUNT AND THOSE GO DIRECTLY FROM ARTERIES TO VEIN SE YOU MU SKIP THE THE ALLERS IS AND INS  ACTUALLY IS ONS I AS I UM SAY THAT IN THE SKIN YOU KNO WHEN I FEEL THE PADS OF MY HANDS UM HOW DEEP TO THE SURFACE DO THESE DO THESE VESSELS REALA THEY'RE BELOW THE OBVIOUSLY I THE ESURE THAT THE THE EPIDERMIS ASOSO IF YOU ARE WORM AND YOU LOOK AT YOUS PALMSEUR HANDS THEY ARE FAIRLY RED THE BAXICER HANDS AREN YOU DON'T HAVE THESE VESSELS IN THE BAXITER HENDS NOW IF YOU TAKE A A GLASS LIKE A WATER TUMBLER RIGHT AND YOU GRAB IT YOU CAN SEE IF YOU SQUEEZE A LITTLE BIT THE HAND GOES WHITE THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE SHUT OFF THAT BLOOD FLOW NO INTERESTING I MANT YO THAT LITTLE HOMIC SIR IF YOU'RE BICYCLING ON A HOT DAY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE GRABBING YOUR HANDLEBARS ALL THE TIME YOU WANT A PERIODICALLY WELL THIS IS IMPORTANT I KNOW YOU OF YOU'RE A PRIVY TO SOME REALLY AMAZING RESULTS THAT WERE IN A TALK ABOUT BUT I ACTUALLY HEARD YOU SAY THIS DURING THIS LECTURE RECENTLY OF THAT STAMFOR HELD ABOUT A HUMAN PERFORMANCE THAT WE BUT WE'RE BOTH PART OF AND YOU MENTION THIS THAT IF YOUR CYCLING AND YOU'RE WORKING HARD AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE WORK IT WE NOW KNOW WHY YOU WANT TO REMAIN COOL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO DO WORK AND IF YOU GET TOO WARM THAT'S BAD THAT GRIPPING THE HANDLEBARS TOO TIGHTLY WILL ACTUALLY LIMIT YOUR PERFORMANCE RIGHT AND THAT'S PROBABLY ALSO TRUE ON THE PELATON OR ANY OTHER COND RI BI SOR THE SKE OR OR ANY RIKE THAT RIGHT SO LOOSEN THE GRIP OR IF YOU SAFELY CAN  WONE T ACTUALLY EXPLOSE YOUR HAND IT'SR TO THE WORLD NOW WHAT ABOUT FOR PEOPLE WEARING GLOVES WHAN BUT THE TO ME THAT JUST SEEMS CRAZY BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU'RE TELLING ME WELL GLOVES DEFINITELY IMPEDE HEAT LOSS AFROM THE HANDS JUST AS SOLKS IMPEDE HEAT LOSS FROM THE FEAT SO IF YOU WANT A MAXIMISE YOUR HEAT LOSS YOU WANT TO HAVE AS THIN OF PROTECTORS AS POSSIBLE ON YOUR HANDS AND COURSE THE FEET ER MORE PROBLEMATICAL BECAUSE HE HAVE TO BE USING THEM IN CERTAIN WAY SOME PEOPLE RUN BAREFOOT WELL YOATHAT'S AT THAT'S BECOME SOMEWHAT POPULAR IT SEEMS LIKE GA CON I CAME AND WHEN THEY HAVE THOSE TOCHOSE THINGS BUT THEY LOOKED SO RIDICULOUS THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE JUST WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE PERFORMANCE HINDRANCE OF REGULAR SHOES ACTUALD BE HAD A TRACTCOACHER AT STANFORD WHO FOR A WHILE WAS FAMOUS FOR INTRODUCING A TRAINING WITH OUT CHOS RUNNING INTEREST AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE IT CHANGED THE POSTURE OF RUNNER AND I THINK IT WAS TDUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF HIS RUNNERS TO LOSE HEAT INTERESTING YA SO HEETING UP AT THE LEVEL OF THE HANDS OBVIOUSLYS GAN HINDER PERFORMANCE SO IF I CAN HAVT WITH RUNNING I NOTICE OM I RAN CROSS COUNTRY BRIEFLY IN HIGH SCHOOL AND AND NOT PARTICUARLY WELL AT THAT BUT THAT WE WERE TOLD TO RUN AS IF WE WERE HOLDING IN A CRACKERS IN OUR IN OUR FINGERS OR SOMETHING LIKE VERY LIGHTLY AND TO KEEP HANDS KINDLY STOL RUNNING LIKE THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE BENEFIC CAN PERFORMANCE THEN R THEN WE'RE GRIPPING A THRONE WHICH IS PROBLY WHAT MIRTH PEOPLE ARE DOING NOW DI ICOMIHT ARE INTERESTING AND UM I ONCE I'LL TELL YOU TH E EXPERIENCE I HAD ONCE I WAS IN ALASKA IN THE WINTER AND I WENT OUT RUNNING AND I ABSENT MINDEDLY FORGOT GLOVES AND I REALIZE THIS F ER A SHORT PERIOD RUNNING BECAUSE THE BACKS OF MY HANDS WERE ACHING FROM THE COLD THE PALMS OF MY HANDS WERE SWEATING AND WERE HOT HO MAZING AMAZING SO THESE COMPARTMENTS ARE A REAL THING AND YOU MENTION THE UPPER HALF OF THE FAILS THAT'S WHERE OUR PRIMATE ANCESTORS DON'T HAVE FUR AND THE BOTTOMS OF OUR FEET SO A LET'S JUST TAKE A MOMENT TALK ABOUT SOME OF THEM OR AMAZING RESULTS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH PROPER COOLING OF THESE GLABER SKIN SURFACES A LET ME INTRODUCE ONE MORE THING SHORT OF AS YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT THE POURING OF WATER ON THE HEAD IT ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH IS NOT APPRECIATED FULLY IS THAT THE BLOOD WHICH IS PEFUSING THESE SPECIAL BLOOD VESSELS IN THE FACE ABOVE THE BEARD LINE THAT'S THE NONHAIRY SKIN THAT BLOOD THEN RETURNS IN THE VENUS SUPPLY TO THE HART BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES IT IN A VERY STRANGE WAY IT ACTUALLY GOES THROUGH WHAT ARE CALLED A BLOCKING ON THE NAME TOW THINK YOUR TIME THESE ARE BLOOD VESSELS THAT GO THROUGH THE SKULL IT AND THAT'S WHY THE SCOUT BLEEDS ALOT IF YOU CUT CUT THE SCOU AND THESE BLOOD VESSELS WHICH ARE CALLED WHAN IS A EMERGENT BUT IT'S NOT EMERGENT IT'S A WORD THAT MEANS LEAVING AN THESE BLOOD VESSELS WERE PRIMARILY THOUGHT TO BE WAYS THAT BLOOD IS LEAVING A THE BRAIN BUT WHEN YOU'RE OVER HEATED THE FDIRECTION OF FLOW IN THOSE BLOOD VESSELS REVERSES SO THE COOL BLOOD THAT'S COMING FROM YOUR FACIAL REGION GOES INTO THAT CIRCULATION AND ACTUALLY IS A COOLING SOURCE FOR THE BRAIN SO YOU CAN COOL THE BRAIN YOU CAN HAVE A COOLING EFFECT ON THE BRAIN BY POURING WATER ON ON YOUR HEAD INTERESTING SO THAT PRACTICE WHICH WE AT LEAST FOR ME I MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATE WITH A COMBAT SPORTS YOWERE SOME ONE THE FIGHTER GOES TO THEIR CORNER THEY USUALLY SIT DOWN ON A ON A STOOL UNLESS THEY'RE TRYING TO A I DO SOME MENTAL A WARFARE FROM THE CORNER IN WHICH CASE THEY THEY DON'T EVEN TAKE A SEAT AND THAT THERE A CORNER CREW WILL WILL SQUEEZE A A GLOVE A EXCUSE ME A SPON FULL OF COLD WATER OVER THE EAR A THAT YOU ARE SAYING IS SOMEWHAT EFFECTIVE IN COOLING THE BRAIN  IT'S ONE OF THE NATURAL MECHANISMS FOR A COOLING THE BRAIN I WANT TO RETURN TO THIS AT SOME POINT AS WELL BUT IS THERE ANY KNOWN BENEFIT TO COOLING THE BRAIN IN TERMS OF OFFSETTING PHYSICAL DAMAGE YOU KNOW OFFSETTING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CONCUSSION BECAUSE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY A FIGHTERS WILL OFTAND GET A A COOL ON THE BACK IN A COL BITEM ON THE BACK OF THE NACK ER ON THE HEAD IS NOT JUST TO COOL THEM DOWN BUT THE THEORY IS THAT IT MIGHT OFFSET SOME OF THE DAMAGE OF NURANS A I JUST CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT I AM AWARE OF THOSE IDEAS BUT THEIR CONTROVERSEAL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO DO FOR INJURY TO THE BRAIN IS TO DECREASE SWELLING AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU DECREASE SWELLING IN MANY PARTS OF THE BODY IS TOO COOL A A IT IT DECREASES INFLAMMATION THAT DECREASES THE BLOOD FLOW SO YOUKNOW I I THINK IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING TOPIC AND AT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AKINDHARD TO INVESTIGATE YEL AM INTERESTING OKES SO I HEAR THESE STORIES AND I'VE SEEN THE DATA SO I BELIEVE THE STORIES A MAYBE TELL US A STORY ABOUT AN OBSERVATION THAT YOUR GROUP HAS MADE WITH RESPECT TO ANEROBIC EXERCISE AND HE AND THIS PROP AND PROPER A COOLING OF THE THESE GLABOROU SERFACES AND WEN TALK ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY AM MAYBE GIVE US THE DIPS EXAMPLE FIRST E G CORSE THAT YOU KNOW MOTHING MOST PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH DIPS HERE STAID I GESS GET RAISIN LOWER YOUR EA RAISING OWER YOUR BODY RAISIN LOWER YOUR BY MASS USUALLY WITH YOUR LEGS DANGLING DOWN SOMETIMES PEOPLE STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTACH A WEIGHT THERE AND  THEY'LL DO IT'S ESENTIALLY I COMPOUND UPPER BODY EXERCISERIGH AM AONE DIP WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE FOR MOST PEOPLE A HUNDRED WOULD BE VERY IMPRESSIVE AM TWENTY WOULD BE IIMPRESSIVE FOR SOME ET CETERA WHAT HAPPENS WHENS A SKILLED ATHLEY COMES IN AND DOES DIPS FOR MULTIBLE SETS AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY COOL PROPERLY USING THE GLABOROUS SKIN SURFACES A THIS WAS A STORY THAT OCCURRED EARLY ON IN OUR INVESTIGATIONS WHEN WE FIRST MADE THE DISCOVERIES THAT COOLING HAS A BENEFIT TO INCREASE YOUR WORK VOLUME YOUR CAPACITY TO DO MORE REPS IC SO THE WORD GOT OVER I THINK TO THE FORTY NINERS CAMP AND ONE OF THEIR PLAYERS GREG CLARK WHO WAS A TIGHT END AT THE TIME HE HAD BEEN TIGHT END AT STANDFORD A HE DECIDED OR I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS ASKED OR WHAT A TO COME OVER AND CHECK IT OUT SO A GREG CAME OVER AND WE SAID GREGG WHAT ARE YOU GOULD AT WHAT WHAT EX ACTIVITY DO YOU LIKE TO DO HE SAID DIPS I CAN DO A LOT OF DIPS I CAN DO FORTY DIPS IN A FIRST SET AND I CAN PROBABLY DO FIVE SET SETS A USUAL WORK OUT FOR ME AND WESAID O KE SO HE CAME OVER TO THE JIM ONE DAY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID HE DID FORTY DIPS FIRST SET AND THAN MAYBE TWENTY FIVE AND FIFTEEN AND NO DOWN DOWN DO YOU RECALL ROUGHLY WHAT KIND OF REST PERIODS HE WAS TAKING BETWEEN YET WE WE INCE WE WE STANDARDIZED THE RESTPIRE TO THREE MINUTES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAD SET ON FOR COOLING AS THE INTRUT'S A GOOD LONG RESTPERIED FYET IT IT IS A LOT IPS GOT YET IT'S ASUALLY A LONGER REST PERIOD THAN MANY A PEOPLE WOULD PER UR DURING WORK OUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE THEM NO ME O TODER TO TAKE AS MUCH AT AS TA MOSSUL GAN SO SEVERAL DAYS LATER HE CAME BACK AND  HIS FIRST SET HE DID I THINK MAY BE FORTY TWO A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT NOW PEOPLE WERE STANDING ROUND WATCHING SO THERE WAS A LITTLE IMPETUS THERE YON'T SHOW OFF ASO THEN IS SECOND SET WAS I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS BUT VERY MUCH ABOVE THE SECOND SET ON THE CONTROL DAY THIS WAS AFTER WE COOLED HIS SOCASE WE DOES ALLINER WHEN IS HE DOING QUUT THE COOLING HE'S HE'S SITTING DOWN AND PUTTING HIS HANDS IN THE DEVICES THAT WE HAD BUILT WHICH WERE COOLING THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS FOR HOW LONG DOES THAT COOLING TAKE CAN HE DO IT INSIDE OF A THREE MINUTE REST PYE THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TOGT WE STANDARD IZE THE O GO THE INTERVAL FOR RESTING OR COOLING A TO THREE MINUTES O CAT BUT THE THE POINT IS HE GOT TO HIS FIFTH SET AND HE AND ALL OF THE SETS WERE ABOVE WHAT HE HAD DONE ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND HE SAID YOU KNOW IAM NOT TIRED I CAN DO ANOTHER SET AND THEN I CAN DO ANOTHER SET I CAN DO ANOTHER SET I CAN DO ANOTHER SET SO FROM ONE DAY TO TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER WITH COOLING HE DOUBLED THE TOTAL WORK VOLUME HE DOUBLED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DIPS BY ADDING MORE SAT AND MORE REPETITIONS TO RI SET RIGHT SO THEN HE KEPT COMING BACK A FOR FOUR MORE WEEKS A TWICE A WEEK AND BY THE END OF THAT MONTH HE WAS DOING THREE HUNDRED DIPS WALSO WHAT PRESENT HE TRIPLED HE TREMBLED AND TRIPLED AS TR HERE'S HERE'S A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE AT PIQUE PHYSICAL CONDITIONING AND HE TRIPLES A MAY WHAT HE CAN DO AMAZING AND IN TERMS OF HIS ABILITY TO RECOVER AM DID WAS THAT EXPLORED OR DISGUSSE AT ALL AM BECAUSE MINOR STANDING IS THAT IF WE CAUSE ENOUGH STRASS TO A MUSCLE DURING ANEROBIC TRAINING WE PROVIDE THE STIMULUS FOR COMPENSITORY REGROWTH ET CETERA BUT IF WE DO MORE WORK WE SENTUALLY SCALE UP THE MOUNT OF RECOVERY THAT'S NEEDED OR THE RECOVERY TIME I'M A VERY CURIOUS ABOUT WEATHER NOT HE NEEDED LONGER TO RECOVER BETWEEN THESE SUPERPERFORMING WORK OUT THAT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT WAS A MAJOR DISCOVERY WHICH WE DIDN'T REALIZE WE WERE MAKING AT THE TIME THERE IS THIS PHENOMENON YOUR REFERRING TO AS DELAYED ON SET MUSCLE SORNESS DOMS AND THIS IS DUE TO THOSE LITTLE MICROTAIRES AND SO FORTH THAT ARK HAPPENING AS WE EXTEND OUR WORK OUT CAPACITY VOLUME E SO WE'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE SO MANY TIMES THAT AN ATHLETE OR ANY ONE WILL COME IN TO THE LAB AND THEY WILL EXCEED WUT THEIR PREVIOUS GOALDS WERE THEIR PREVOUS EXPECTATIONS AND I CAN ALWAYS SEE THE WORDS COMING OUT OF THEIR MOUTH I'M GOING TO BE SO SORE TO MORROW THEY NEVER ARE INTERST AND WE'VE ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATED THAT WITH A NAIVE GROUP WE HAD A CLASS A PHYSICAL CONDITIONING CLASS AND A WE HAD HALF OF THEM AT WTHE FIRST DAYS OF THE CLASS WE HAD TO ESTABLISH THERE TRUE CAPACITY WHAT THEY COULD DO SO THIS WERE PRETTY HEAVY WORK OUTS FOR THESE NEW RECRUITS AND A WE GAVE HALF OF TEMTHE BENEFIT OF COOLING AND THE OTHER HAVE NOT AND THEN WE HAD THEM RECORD THEIR SUBJECTIVE LEVELS OF DELAYED ON SET MUSCL ORNES AND THEY THOSE THAT WERE COOL DIDN'T HAVE SIGNIFICANT MUSCL SORENESS AMAZING AND I KNOW THEYRE ALSO PUBLISHED RESULT AND WWE WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO SOME OF THESE PAPERS FOR PEOPLE UN SEEING SIMILAR EFFECTS A I SHOULD SAY SIMILAR PERFORMANCE ENHANCING EFFECTS USING M BENCH PRESSES I BENCH PRASS OR PUSHOPS OR OTHER OTHER SORTS OF THINGS MAYBO COULD GIVE US AN EXAMPLE FROM THE REALM OF ENDURANCE WORK OR OR A ROBIC WORK A RUNNING CYCLING THINGS OF THAT SORT WELL ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE' AFOR US IS THAT OUR EQUIPMENT NOW IS NOT REALLY PORTABLE I MEAN IT'S PORTABLE IN THE SENSE YOU CAN CARRY IT TO THE GIM OR TO THE FOOTBALL FIELD BE YOU NOT IN TO RUN BUT NOTHER RUN WITH HIM A SOR  WE R BICYCLE WITH ALL THE WEN OR THE COOLING HANDLES ON BICYCLES YE THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE GOOD BUT ONE ONE I TUNERANT ACTIVITY IS GOLFING PEOPLE HAVE PUT IT ON THEIR GOLF CARTS AND THE THAT WILL REALLY HEAT UP THAT MUCH INGULF THEY DO NOT TO TO BE DISPARAGING IN THE GOLFERS BUT THE WAY I THCONCEPTIONALIZED GOLF IT'S LIKE A SWING AND THEN A WALK AND THEN A AND THEN A CART RIDE AND THEN A MEAL I PROBABLY JUST OFFENDIT ALL THE GOLFERS OUT THERE WELL WE WHAT ONE TIME WE HAD WE WERE DOING WORK FOR THE FOR THE A DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE AND THEY WANTED TO CHECK IT OUT WHETHER NOT WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS REALLY WORTH WHILE SO THEY SENT OUT A TEAM OF SPECIAL A SPECIAL OP SOLDIERS TO BE OUR SUBJECTS TESTED OUT THEY WERE HERE FOR A WEEK SO THEY WTHAT WAS A FUN WE YT THERI DO SOME WORK WITH THOSE GUISE THERE THEY'RE HARD DRIVING YA THE THEY ALSAN OG AN BRERE YAT THEY THEY DEFONLY HAVE UM IF THEY HAVE AN OFF ER AS QUITS WHICH IT'S BURIED DEEP WITHIN THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM THEY DON'T LIKE TO HIT THAT THAT QUITS WITCH SO THE GUY WHO WROTE THE FINAL REPORT HE GAVE AN ADENDUM TO THE REPORT HE SAID WELL I'LL TELL YOU THIS AFTER I'VE GOTEN HOME IT'S ADDED THAT TECHNOL THEY TOOK THE TECHNOLOGY WITH THEM  WANTED TO GELL YA THAT'S ATHATS SOUNDS OF BAR I  AND AND USING IT IT AS ADDED TWENTY YARDS TO EVERY CLUB IN MY BAG AND THAT'S NO EIMSMALL WESO IT'S ALOWING PEOPLE TO HIT FOR THER GET THE GOLF ALF FURTHER INTEREST UM YOU'L RIGHT SO FOR THE FOR THE A GOLF AN PLAYERS OUT THERE AND THE UM IT THEN NOD THAT'S THE UM THAT'S A REWARD TO GET BACK FROM CRAG FOR ALL MY M MY LITTLE KNOCKS ON GOLF IASHE I DON'T HAVE ANY KNOCK ON GOLL I JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS A SPORT WHERE HEETING UP IS A LIMITING FACTOR SO SINCE THEY'RE GETTING MORE MORE OUT OF THEIR DRIVE WHAT'S WHAT HE THINK'S GOING ON THERE WELL THEY CAN BE HEATING UP AND THERE WASN'T BEEN OUS RIGHT THEY'RE WER'T GOIT ONE A HOT DAY AND HE EHE FORTH BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU ONE MORE SERIOUS A STORY ABOUT GULFERS AND THAT IS INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIPLE SCOROSIS OR EXCEEDINGLY TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE I DIDN'T KNOW SO THEY MAY STILL BE MOBILE ABUT THEY HAVE TO STAY IN COOL LOCATIONS AND NOT INCREASE THEIR EXERCISE TO ANY GREAT EXTENT BUT WE'VE HAD A SUBJECTS THAT HAVE WITH MULTIPOSCOROSAS WHO JUST ESSENTIALLY PUT THE DEVICE ON THEIR GOLF CART NEIR BACK OUT PLAYING GOLF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER O THAT'S GREAT THAT'S GREAT DO ANYTHING THET ALLOWS PEOPLE TO HAVE NORMAL LEVELS RIGHT OF OM YOU KNOW LIVELIHOOD AND OM AND RECREATION IS GREAT WE ALWAY THNG ABOUT PERFORMANCE AS THE AT THESE KIND OF LIKE PKIN O LE LEVELS AND ONM PUSHING HARDER BUT ANYTHING THEY' LOUS PEOPLE TO BE TO BE MOBI RIG HUNCTION WAS GREAT SO UM WHAT'S YOUR FAVORED EXAMPLE OF ENDURANCE AND FEEL FREE TO GIVE US THE EXTREME ONE AND THEM WE'LL TALK ABOUT AVERAGES AT AM TO BE YOU T MAKE SURE WE'RE THOROUGH ABOUT AVERAGES VERSES EXCEPTIONS RIGHT WE HAVEN'T DONE A LOT IN FEEL MEEN OUT OUT DOORS A MOST OF OUR ENDURANCE HAS BEEN IN A HOT ROOM W TREADMILL WORK AND SO FORTH SO THE VERY FIRST EXPERIMENT WE HAD I THINK MAY BE EIGHTEEN SUBJECTS JUST OFF THE STREET MAY WE JUST RECRUITED PEOPLE IN THE ALLWAYS COME ON IN AND DO THIS AND WHAT WEVE FOUND IS WE COULD FOR THIS GROUP WITH ONE TRIAL WITH AM WITHOUT COOLING WE COULD DOUBLE THEIR ENDURANCE WALKING ON THE TREAD MILL WALKING UP HILL IN THE TREADMILL IN THE HEAT LIKE MAY BE FORTY DEGREES CAN BE IN TEMPERATURE FORTY TO RECENTIGRATE SO WHAT IS THAT EXPERIMENT LOOK LIKE YOUR HAVING PEOPLE WALK ON AND INCLINE IT'S REALLY WARM SOME PEOPLE AR JUST CAN A HIT THE QUIT BUT AN AND SAY I'VE HAD ENOFFH AND GET OFF THE TREAD MIL RIT WITH PROPER COOLING WHEN ARE THEY DOING THE COOLING THERE THEY'RE DOING IT CONTINUOUSLY I SEE BECAUSE IN THE LABORATORY WE CAN SUSPEND DEVICES FROM THE CEILING FOR EXAMPLE NOW WE DO HAVE PROTOTYPE WEARABLE DEVICES WE DID THEM AIN RESPONSE TO EMALS FROM A EBOLA WORKERS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IN A SIERRA LEON THEY SAID WE'VE READ ABOUT YOUR WORK WITH ASSLETS CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING FOR US MAND WE'RE IN THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE GEAR AND WE CAN'T BE IN THE HOPZONE FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES SO THAT WAS STARTED US ON THE A ECHALLENGE OF DEVELOPING WEARABLE SYSTEMS THAT COULD GO UNDER THE P P E A WE'E PUBLISHD THAT WORK NOW THAT'S GREATE DERE NON NOTHING THE MILITARY SPECIAL OPERATORS THAT ARE OUT IN THE DESERT AND OTHER LOCATIONS ARE PRIVABLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS TECNOLOGY WELL ONCE THEY GET ON THIN GETIT'S  COMEAND THAT'S IT'S COMING YE YOU KNOW I THINK SOME PEOPLE UM MIGHT WONDER YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE ALL THESE STUDIES AND THERE THESE INCREDIBLE RESULTS OVER THE YEARS A WHY HAVEN'T WE HEARD MORE ABOUT IN I WILL ASK YOUR OPINION ON THAT AS WELL BUT ALL JUST EDITORIALIZE AL BUT S THAT  THE THE BEST LABORATORY WORK AN IT'S PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OFTENTIMES REQUIRES MANY STUDIES AAND OFTENTIMES THERE ISN'T A PORTAL  SO TO SPEAK A TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT INTO THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR S THERE IS IT A COMPANY THAT'S DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR PEOPLE TO USE A WRIGHT TO PURCHASE IN YEARS I'M WE MIGHTS WHET JUST TELL US NOW WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT COMPANY AND AND DO THEY HAVE A WEBSIHE PEOPLE A GON WANT TO KNOW A WHERE CAN THEY GET THIS MAGICAL TECHKNOLOGY AND AND IS THERE A POOR MEN'S VERSION OF IT AS WELL WELL THE COMPANYS ARTURIA A R T E R I A AND THE WEBSIHE IS W W W DOT COOL MIT DOT COM SO COOL MIT IS JUST C O O L M I T TN GO MIT NOT COM IT'S A GREAT WEBSIHE WHEN I WENT THERE IT SAYS THAT RIGHT NOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS IN MILITARY IS THAT TRUEWELL WHERE WE STAND NOW IS A THE NEW VERSION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS SORT OF INBATE AT TEST VERSIONS WE GOT IT INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD USE THE TECHNOLOGY BEFORE SO THERE'S A ANIFEL A TEAMSITER USING THAT THERE'S A A COLLEGE TEAMSERS A LIMPICS THERE'S THE A NAVY SEAL A A MAJOR D BASEBALL THE ENB A A THE NATIONAL TENNIS ASSOCIATION THEY HAVE LOCATIONS WHERE NOW THEY ARE TRYING THIS OUT AND REPORTING BACK HOUSE AT WORKING HOW COULD YOU CHANGE IT HOW COULD YOU IMPROVE IT GREAT AND SO FORTH SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE ARE BUT ON THE WEBSIHTE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SIGN UP FOR BEING ONE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO GET ONE WHEN THEY ARE FINALLY MANUFACTURED THEY'RE NOW BEING MADE IN FAIRLY SMALL LOTS BECAUSE YOU WANT O CHANGE THINGS SURY REALIZE HOW IT CAN BE IMPROVED YET THIS IS STAMFORD AFTER ALL YOU WANT IT GET THE TECHKNOLOGY RIGHT I I LIKE TO JOKE THAT A ONE OF THE READS I LIKING IT STAMFORD SO MUCH IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE MY COLLEGUES AMAZING AND THEYRE SO FORWARD THINKING BUT THEY'RE ALL PERFECTIONESTS AND SO THAT THE PERFECTION IS MIND THAIT IS IT HAS TO BE PERFECT BEFORE I CAN GO GO LIVE SO TO SPEAK WHI THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF INTEREST UM LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY IN A LITE MORE DETAIL FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WAT'S TALK ABOUT WHETHER NOT CRUDER FORMS OF THAT TECHNOLOGY EXIST EITHER FOR SAKE OF SAFETY AND OR PERFORMANCE UM SO WHAT IS AUM THA THE COOL MEN AS I UNDERSTAND IS IT IT'S A IT'S A MIT IT'S A GLOVE AND H PUT YOUR HAND INTO U YOU HOLD ON TO A  SURFACE AND THAT SURFACE U COOLS YOU COOLS YOUR HAND AND WRIE THEREBY THROUGH THIS O SPECIALIZE A PORTAL COOLSET YOUR CORBODY TEMPERTURE AND ALL ALL THE MUSCLES OF THE BODY SUBJECTIVELY IF I WERE TO DO THIS RIGHT OW WOUL I THINK THAT IT WAS ICE COLD OR WOULD I THINK IT WAS JUST COOL JUST COOL I SEE ICE COLD IS TOO COLD SO PEOPLE ALWAYS ASKE  WHY CAN'T YOU JUST STICK YOUR HAND IN A BUCKET OF ICE WATER IT'S TOO COLD WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT CAUSES REFLECTS OF AS O CONSTRICTION OF THE VERY PORTALS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE HEAT LOSS FROM SO YOU STICK YOUR AND IN COLD WATER AND WHEN IT COMES OUT IT'S COLD YOU JUST SEALED UP ALL THE HEAT ERU ARE O RIGHT SO WHAT I SORT OF RECOMMENDED TO SOMEONE AT ONE POINT THEY SAID WELL WHEN I AM RUNNING CAN I JUST CARRY A FROZEN JUICE CAN AND IT WILL GRADUALLY MELT I SAID WELL KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO DECREASE THE HEAT LOSS FROM THAT HEAD BUT IF EVERY COUPLE MINUTES YOU SWITCHED HANDS THAT IT MIGHT WORK WELL I HAVE A FEELING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW DOING THAT WELL I TRYING TRYING THIS SO A HOW LONG IN IN THE COOL MIT AT THE PROPER TAETUR A HOW LONG AR ARE PEOPLE PUTTING THEIR HANDS INTO THE MIT BUT WWE ONCE AGAIN HAD JUST STANDARDIZED ON THREE MINUTES AND PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE HEAT LAW THE RATE OF HEAT LOSS IS AN EXPINENTIALLY DECLINING CURVE EAND THREE MINUTES SORT OF GETS THE BEST PART OF THE CURVE SO YOU CAN GO LONGER AND GET MORE BENEFIT BUT THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IS IN THE FIRST TOO THREE MINUTES YOU MENTIOND AA NUMBER OF IMPRESSIVE ORGANIZATION SPORTS STEAMS IN MILITARY THAT ARE USING THIS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I TYPICALLY SEE ON THE SIDE LINES OF GAMES ALLTHOUGT TO BE OSS I HAVE N LOOKED VERY CAREFULLY A I'M GUESSING THAT THEYRE ARE PROBABLY KEEPING THE TECHNOLOGY SOMEWHAT UNDER WRAPS AWHERE AND HOW ARE THEY DOING THIS OF THEY RUNNING BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM I MEAN THAT THE MILITARY SPECIAOPPARS ARE DOING THEIRE THING BUT INTERMS OF THE ATHLETES A IS IT POSSIBLE HYPOTHETICALLY THE ATHLETES ARE DOING THIS AM SOMEWHAT IN COGNITO I IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW A PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED HERE AT STANFORD A THEY DON'T SEE THE FOOTBALL TEAM USING IT WELL THE FOOTBALL TEAM HERE AT TANFORD AS MOSTLY PLAYING IN COLD WEATHER COOL WEATHER NIGHT GAMES ARE COOL EVEN DATE GAMES ARE NOT VERY HOT FREQUENTLY HERE BUT WHEN THEY GO TO A HOT PLACE LIKE ARIZONARE YOU TALL AT LEAST OUR COACH A SHAW SAYS THAT THEY TAKE IT WITH THEM AND THATS WHEN THEY FIND THE BENEFITS WHEN THEY USE I INTERESTING SO IS THERE A POOR PERSONS A POOR MEN ARE WOMAN'S VERSION OF THIS YOU MENTION THE JUICE CAN PASSING BACK AND FORTH YOU MENTION COOLING THE HANDS  A NUMBER OF PEOPL SAID TO ME AFTER LEARNING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCE SOME BIG EFFECTS A POSITIVE OF FACTS OF OF COOLING BY AAND I CONFESS I'VE DONE THIS TIGGING I I A PACKAGE OF FROZEN BLUEBERRIES AN YOU CON PASSING BACK AND YERE BUT YOU MA HANDS NOW T ALKINGTO YOU I REALIZE I PROBABLY DIDN'T DO IT LONG ENOUGH I PROU WAS I WAS ONLY DOING MAYBE THIRTY SECONDS PASSING IT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN MY HANDS AND THEN GOING BACK INTO SATS I DID SEE A PERFORMANCE ENHANCING E FACT IF ABSOLUTELY BUT UM I REALIZE I PROBABLY WASN'T OPTIMIZING THE PROTO CALL IF YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE A U A CRUDE PROTO CALL FOR LET'S US TO SAY FOR THE GIM BECAUSE WITH RUNNING IT'S A LITTLE BIT TRICKY BUT UM WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE IF PEOPLE WANTO JUST PLAY WITH THIS I IN SOME SORT OF FASHION WELL THAT IT YET I IT'S WOULD BE EXPERIMENTAL SURE AND YET NONE OF THAT IS CAN VERY CONTROLLED YOUR IDEA FROZEN PEAS IS A GOOD IDEA AND I THINK SINCE THERE'S BEEN NO ACTUAL STUDY OF THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE YOU WORKING OUT WHAT IS THE BEST FOR YOU BUT ONE WAY TO FIGURE IT OUT IS THAT IF AFTER YOU HOLD THE COLD PEASE IN ONE HAND AND YOU SWITCH IT O THE OTHER HAND IF SOME ONE THEN COMES AND FEELS YOUR HAND IS IT WARMER COL IF IT'S COLD IT MEANS YOU VASLE CONSTRICTED  IF IT'S WARM IT MEANS THE HOT BLOOD IS STILL GOING THERE  SO WE DO THAT IN THE LAV AND THE KEY IS FOR ITS TO NOTVAS A CONSTRICT RIGHT O KI SO SO THERE'S A TAST OUT THERE FOLKS IF YOU ING TO TRY THIS IN KIND OF CRUDED FASHION AT LEAST UNTIL THE A THE COOL MIT IS AVAILABLE MORE BROADLY UM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC YOU COULD A SASS YOU WANT A SASS WEATHER NOT THE YOUR PALM'S ACTUALLY FEEL COOL TO THE TOUCH BY SOMEBODY ELSE TOUS AND IF IT DOES THAT MEANS YOU YOU'VE ASSENTIALLY SHUT DOWN THE PORTER YOUR SEALING IN MORE NIGHT WHICH IS BAD WHAT ABOUT UM PUTTING THIS COLD PACK OF SOME SORT ON THE FACE OR UM OR THE FEET MORE THE FEET I WORK OUT AT HOME I I DON'T OFTEN WORK OUT BAREFOOTED BUT I SUPPOSE I COULD LIKE THEY DID IN THE SEVENTIES YOU KNOW IN THOSE GES WERE WALKING AROUND AND WITHOUT SHOOES IN SQUATTING WITHOUT YOU A WITHOUT ANY SHOOS OR STOCKS ON COULD I PUT MY FEET ON THEM YOU YOU COULD UM IF YOU HAS SIMPLY HAD A WATER PROFUSED PAD AND YOU WERE CIRCULATING COOL WATER THROUGH IT I YOU COULD JUST PUT YOUR FEET ON IT UM PART OF THE PROBLEM IS UM IT YOU DON'T WANT IF LET'S SAY YOU HAVE JUST A COLD PACK OF SOMETHING THE PROBLEM IS BACK TO BOUNDARY LAYERS AGAIN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CONVECT OF STREAM OF THE COOLING MEDIUM THE HEAT SINK IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THER'LL BE A BOUNDARY LAYER DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE HEAT SINK MATERIAL AND YOUR SKIN A SO THAT DECREASE IS IT'S IT'S EFFICACY I SEE A MAYS YOU JUST FOR A MOMENT TALK ABOUT CONVECTION A RADATION IN CONVECTION AND JUST MAKE THAT CLEAR LIKE IF I PUT MY HANDS UM LET'S IT'S A COLD NIGHT AND A MET A CAMP FIRE AND I TAKE MY HANDS AND I PUT THEM OUT TO THE FIRE THE'RE GETTING RADIATION YOU'RE GETTING RADIATION RN I RIH AND AND THEN IF IT'S A WINDY WARM NIGHT NOT GET ENOUGH THAT'S THE THAT'S EXAMPLE GIVE US HA  GOOD EXAMPLE OF CONVECTION A CONVECTION SURIS IS IN A COOL BREEZE YONO THE WINDSHILL FAGITOR THAT'S DO TO CONVECTION EBUT IN TERMS OF HEAT TRANSFER BETWEEN TWO OBJECKS AIF YOU HAVE CONVECTION OF THE MEDIUM WHETHER IT'S BLOOD ON THE INSIDE AND WATER ON TE OUTSIDE YOU INCREASE THE HEAT EXCHANGE IF YOU HAVE CONVECTION ON BOTH SIDE RIGHT SO THIS IS WHY JUST PLANTING MY FEET ON TO O PACKAGES OFFROAT MY BARE FEET ON TWO PACKGES OFFROZEN PEECE THERE'S REALLY NO OPPORTUNITY FOR CIRCULATION ROL ANY IN THEREFORE HEA TRANSFERS SO IT'S NOT REALLY OPTIMAL WHICH IS I AND I B ONCE AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE SURFACE AREA TO GET ANY BENEFIT AT ALL WE HAVE A STUDY T WE PUBLISHED A WHICH WAS INVESTIGATING THE STANDARD TREATMENT FOR HYPEROFERMIA IN THE FIELD AND THE STANDARD ATREATMENT THE THE TIS RECOMMENDED BY MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS IS YOU TAKE COL PACKS AND YOU PUT THEM IN THE AXILA THE GROIN THE AXILAR THE ARTHE ARTHE ARM PAY ARM PITS YOU HAVE THE GROIN WHICH IS ATHIN SKIN LOTS OF ASCICLATUR R AND HE AND THE NECK SO WHAT WE DID IS WE DID STUDIES IN WHICH WE MADE PEOPLE HYPROFERMIC AND THEN WE MEASURED THE RATE AT WHICH WE COULD COOL THEM BY PUTTING THOSE POSITIONS IN THE WT THOSE HEAT EXCHANGE BAGS IN THE RECOMMENDED LOCATION VERSES ON THE GLABORA SKIN VERSIS PALM SOLS AN FACE THE THE COOLING RATE WAS DOUBLE WEL SO WE PUT THE SAME ICE PACKS THE SAME COLD PACKS ON THE AHEAT CORTALS RATHER THAN A THE AXILA THE GROIN IN THE FACE WELL ARE THE NECK WELL SO FACE HANDS AND BOTTOMS OF FEET WILL COOL YOU TWICE AS FAST THAS WERE PUTTING MY COLD PACKS INTO YOUR ARM PITS YOUR GROIN OR BACK OF NECK SO SO I LIKE TO GIVE THE ANALOGY OF IF YOUR CAR IS OVER HEATING KAND YOU HAVE A HOSE GARDEN HOSE WHERE SHOULD YOU SPRAY YOUR COOLING SYSTEM SHOULD YOU SPRAY THE RADIATOR OR SHOULD YOU SPRAY THE TUBES GOING IN AND OUT OF THE RADIATOR WELL THE RATIONAL WUL PUTTING THESE COLD PACKS IN THE AXIL AT THE GROIN IN THE NECK IS THAT YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE MAJOR ARTERIES SURE THAT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE BUT IT'S MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IF YOU ACTUALLY INCREASE THE HEAT LOST CAPACITY OF THE RADIATING SURFACE THE RADIATORS SO YOU COOL THE HOT STUFF HEADING TOWARD THE COR THAT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE IS THTHAT YOU HIT THE ARTERIES AMIS INHE VEINS ARTERIES IN VEINS AMINIT JUST TELL A BRE STORY THAT OM ILLUSTRATES HOW ALMOST EVERYBODY GETS THIS STUFF WRONG AND UMMESAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK YOU ABOUT HEATING DELIBERATE HEATING AS OPPOSED TO DELIBERATE COOLING SO ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO A FRIEND O MINE AT INCIDENTALLY A A GUY WHO DID NINE YEARS IN THE SEAL TEAMS REALLY SKILLED COLD WATER SWIMMER WE WENT OUT FOR SWIMMIN THE MORNING A I'M NOT NEARLY I EVEN CLOSE TO THE BEING IN THE SAME UNIVERSE OF HIS A OUT PUT POTENTIAL WE DO THESE SWIMS I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEM I GOT ENOUGH BLUBBER ON ME THAT I'M STAY WARM ENOUGH IN THE COLD PACIFIC NOWET SUITS WE DO THE MORNING CULT COLD SWIM FOR ABOUT A MILE OR SO AND WE BROUGHT WITH US A I YOUNG KID THAT I KNOW REAL WELL THAT HANGS OUT WITH US SOMETIMES AN TRAINS WITH US WHO'S GOT VERY LITTLE BODY FAT HE'S JUST EXCEPTIONALLY LEAN DESPITE EATING EVERYTHING INSIN RIGHT OTEEN AGER GREAT ATH THE GREAT KID GREAT SWIMMER SO WE'RE OUT THERE SWIMMING AND AT SOME POINT WE'RE TALKING HIM IN IT'S CLEAR THAT HE'S GONE HYPEOTHERMIC HE'S SLEARN HIS WORDS HE'S NOT DOING WHILE SO WE GET HIM ON TO THE BEACH HIS TEETH ARE TURNING YELLOW HE'S QUAKING HE'S NOT HE'S GOT AM YOU HIS SALIVA IS TAKING ON THAT CONSISTENCY THAT'S CLEAR THAKE HE'S PYPE OTHERMIT WE GO THE LIFEGUARD STATION LIFEGUARD SAYS OKET LET'S GET HIS VITALS LETS DO ALL THIS MEANWHILE TRYING STAND NEXT TO HIM YOU KNOW AND HEAT HIM UP BY HEATING UP HIS TORSO SO WIT THERE WE ARE LIKE PRESSING AGAINST THIS GUY OUR FRIEND TRYING TO HEAT HIM UP THEY GET A BLANKET ON HIM HE'S I'M REALIZING HE WAS BAREFOOT HIS FACE WAS EXPOSED ALTHOUGH WE DID COVER HIS HEAD WITH THE BLANKET AND HE EVENTUALLY CAME BACK WE GOT SOME WARM LIQUIDS INTO HIM ANDHY HE WAS OKE HE WAS FINE I NONEO THIS MOTHER IS EVER INOLET HIM SWIM WITH US AGAIN A IF IF I EVER DISAPPEAR AND GO MISSING IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT INCIDENT ANYWAY AH HE DID GREAT HE RECOVERED HE'S BACK IN THE WATER AND DOING WELL BUT I REALIZE THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING FROM THE POINT WHERE WE GOT BACK ON THE BEACH UNTIL HE WAS BACKED AN ORMAL WAS WE DID INCORRECTLY WE HEATED AS TORSO WE LEFT HIS EXTREMITI'S EXPOSED AND WE ASSOOM WE WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND THE LIFE GUARD IS A SKILLED LIFE GUARD AT A MAJOR PUBLIC BEACH SO I GUESS THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS DID WE GET EVERYTHING WRONG DID WE GET ANYTHING RIGHT AND WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BETTER OPTION TO HEAT UP A HYPOTHERMIC PERSON IN THAT OR SIMILAR SITUATION WELLITS INTERESTING YOU ASKED THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY WE GOT INTO THIS AREA OF INVESTIGATION A I WORKED ON HOW THE HYPOTHALEMUS REGULATES BODY TEMPERATURE NERAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ONE DAY WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH A COLLEAGUE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ATASATIA AND TA HE JOKINGLY SAID TO MY COLLDAG HE SAID YI YOU GUY THINKYOU OW SO MUCH ABOUT TEMPERATURE I BET YOU COULDN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE RECOVERY ROOM WHAT'S THAT WELL THE PATIENTS COME OUT OF SURGERY THEIR HYPOTHERMIC AND IT TAKES US HOURS TO GET THEM TO STOP SHIVERING WHAT DO THEY DO IN THE RECOVERY ROOM EXACTLY WHAT YOU SUGGEST AD THEY PUT IN WARM BLANKETS THEY PUT AN HEAT LAMPS AAND IT TAKES THEM AN HOUR OR TWO HOURS TO GET THESE PATIENTS TO STOP SHIVERING TO BRING THEM BACK UP OSO WE SAY OUT'S A TRIVIAL PROBLEM NO IT'S A HARD PROBLEM IT'S A HARD PROBLEM BECAUSE WHEN YOURE UNDER ANESTHESIA YOUR VAZA DILATED WHEN YOU COME OUT OF ANESTHESIA YOUR HYPOTHERMIC AND YOU VASO CONSTRICT THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET HEAT INTO THE BODY SO WE GOT THE IDEA WELL IF WE COULD JUST TAKE ONE APPENDICH LIKE AN ARM AND WE PUT IT IN A A ENVIRONMENT WRAPPED IN A HEATING PAD AND A NEGATIVE PRESSURE YOUR SUCTION THAT WOULD PULL MORE BLOOD INTO THAT LIMB THAT BLOOD WOULD GET HEATED AND IT WOULD WARM THE BODY UP FASTER SO MY COLLEGUE BUILT A PROTOTYPE DEVICE YOU COULDN'T GET SUCH A DEVICE INTO THE HOSPITAL THESE DAYS WERE WITH OUR ANASTHESIOLOGIS FRIEND WE TOOK IT INTO THE RECOVERY ROOM AND AND FIRST THING THE PATIENT SAID NO WAY NOTO PUT THAT ON MY PATIENT BUT HE PREVAILED AND FIRST PATIENT INSDIDN'T SHIVER AT ALL FIRST PATIENT WAS BACK TO NORMAL TEMPERATURE COR TEMPERATURE IN I THINK IT WAS EIGHT MINUTES A MAZE OR NINE MINUTES IS THIS NOW STANDARD PRACTICE NONO NO NO SO THIS IS ANOTHER NEXAM NOWHERE I DON'T GET UPSET ABOUT THE ALTHOUGH I IT'S UPSETTING TO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT BUT I THINK THAT IT'S YET ANOTHER CASE WHERE A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM EXIST THERE'S A A SCIENCE BASE SOLUTION THAT MAKE SENSE AT THE LEVEL OF PHYSIOLOGY ENGINEERING AND PRACTISE AND YET IT'S NOPING NOT RIGHT AND I MEAN WE COLD THAT WE THAT'S AL WHLE OTHER DISCUSSION AS TO WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE WELL PERHAPS IN AN I KNOW NUMBER OF OUR LISTENERS ARE IN THE HEALTH CAR AND METER YE HE PROFESSIONS WELL AS MILITARY ALIES AND JUST ALSO STANDARD OTHER TYPES OF JOVS CIVILIANS OF A DOING NOTHER TYPES OF WORK A IT WULD BE WONDERFUL IF PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THIS SO AM ONCE AGAIN IS THERE A A IS THERE A HOME GROWN TECHNOLOGY THAT PEOPLE COULD USE IF SOMEBODY'S HYPOTHERMIC WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY FOR THEM TO WARM UP AS E IN ME HOLDING A A NICE WARM A MUG OF COCO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT NOT NOT TOO HOT I GUESS IS THERE AGAIN TE IDEA WELL ACTUAL YOU CAN GO HARDER ON THE ON THE GLABORA SKIN NO BECUS IT'LL DILATE BEBECAUSE IT TAKES THE HEAT AWAY FASTER NO BUT BACK TO THE ANASESIA WHAT YOU CAN DO AS YOU CAN USE A WARM PADS THEY HAVE THEM IN AT ALL HOSPITALS THEY HAVE CIRCULATING WATER PERFUSED PADS O WATER BOTTLE TI WAS THE EAT SO LETIPICALLY THEY'LL SLIDE THEM UNDER YOUR LOWER BACK OR SOMETHING LI YEPUT THEM AND PUT THEM ON THE FEET SURE THAT THAT WILL DO IT BUT TURMS OUT THAT WE DISCOVERED THROUGH THIS WORK THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WHOLE ARM IT WAS ONLY THE HAND AND THAT'S WHEN WE CAME TO THE REALIZATION OF THESE SPECIAL BLOOD VESSELS WE DIDN'T DISCOVER THE BLOOD VESSELS THE'RE DESCRIBED IN GRAYS AND ANIMY BUT NOBODY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE FOR ARAN YOU MENTION BEARS EARLIER IN OTHER HAIRY ANIMALS AM DO THEY HAVE THESE AVIES YET AS WELL AN ISUPPASE WE HAVEN'T TO FIND AVIES WE'VE BEEN PRETTY GET ABOUT THE KNOW ACRNYMSTHROAL AVIES IS ARCURIA VENUS AND ESTIMOSES SO A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ARTERIES IN THE VEINS I ACTUALLY USE THIS THATKNOWLEGEY HAVE A BULL DOG BULDOG MASTEHE HAS A VERY HIGH AM PROPENSITY FOR OVERHEATING AS THAY THEIR TERRIBLE DUMPING HEAT AND BULLDOGS ARE GREAT AT PUSHING THEMSELVES ATO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION OR DEATH IT HAPPENS AND SO NOW WE DO WHAT WE CALL PALM OR COOLIN ARE I CAN'T HELP MYSELF WHERE I'LL TAKE COSTELLOAND LOWER HIM INTO A COOL BODY OF WATER JUST TH JUST THE BOMS OF HIS POZZLE THUGHI THINK ANIMALS ANSTINCTUALLY NO TO DO THIS AND WE'LL GO AND STAND AND BY A BODIES OF WATER THEY DON'T OFTEN LIE DOWN ALL THE WAY A SOME DO YEAM BUT THEY SEEM TO KNOW THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO COOL THEMSELVES OFF YE  ABSOLUTELY AND THEY GET THE ADVANTAGE THAT THEIR PAM THAT THEIR PALMS AND THEIR FEET ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING WE WE ACTUALLY BUILT DEVICES FOR DOGS DID YOU REALLY AND TRIED THEM ON I DID AR OD SLED DOGS AND THE WORK BEAUTIFULLY THEY HAD LITTLE BACK PACKS LWITH THE EQUIPMENT AND PADS ON ALL THEIR FEET AND AND THEY WORK U AMAZINEA IS A ALONG THE LINES OF HEATING DELIBERATE HEATING WEARING A NIT AM CAP IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE MORE OF THAT ON THE EAST COAST YOU KNOT YOU RUN AROUND BOSTON IN NEW ENGLAND YE WITH A WITH A NIT CAP I'VE ALWAYS DONE THAT THAT THE START OF MY RUNS TO TRYING WARM UT  MORE EVICALLY AND THEN I TAKE IT OFF A SHED LAYERS AS I GO AM IS THAT A RATIONAL PRACTIS THE WAY I JUST OTRIVED IT N CAUSE WARMING UP IS IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF QUOTIN G WARMING UP THAT'S REQUIRED TO LUBRICATE JOINTS OR AT LEAST TO GET THE SENSE THAT JOINTS ARE LUBRICATED AND AND TO BE ABLE TO MOVE MORE EASILY E DO YOU STILL RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE WARM UP YEABUT I THINK WE'RE MISLED BY THE TERM WARM UP AS IF THE MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO RAISE TEMPERATURE A I DO'T'M NOT AWARE OF ANY DATA ON THIS BUT I I DO THINK THAT THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION IS INCREASING FLEXIBILITY U  YOU'RE GOING TO AVOID HAVING DAMAGE A JOINTS AND AND TENDANS AND LEGAMENTS AND SO FORTH ABUT ALSO A THEY ABILITY OF THE MITE CUNDRIA TO PRODUCE A ENERGY A CAN BE IMPAIRED AT LOW LOWER TEMPERATURES AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE SAY OUR BODY TEMPERATURES THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE FARRIS ACROSS THE DAY IT'S WELL IT VARIES IN PARTS OF YOUR BODY MEN MY HANDS AND ARMS ARE NOT AT THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES RIGHT NOW THEY'RE MUCH LOWER  THTHAT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE COOR BODY TEMPERATURE WELL THE BEST COR TEMPERATURE IS THAT WHAT WE USE IS A SOVAGEAL SO WE PUT A THERMA COUPLE UP THE NOSE ABOUT TWO FEET DOWN HISOPHICA SO THAT IS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF YOUR HEART NOT JIM OR I I THOUGI NO AND OT SOME OF THOSE COVIDS WOB TASCO PER YOU AR AN O MAGN IS YOU GOING ANY FOR THAT FELT LIKE MY BRAIN WAS GETTING TICKLE A AND AT'S TOANISM A TYMPANIC IS A PRETTY GOOD TO THE EAR DEAR AIT'S NOT FOOL PROOF BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT AIMED PROPERLY AT THE TYMPANUM AND FREQUENTLY WHAT YOURE GETTING IS YOUR GETTING SORT OF A MIXTURE OF TYMPANIC PLUS OUR CANAL TEMPERATURE AND THE AND FOR THOSE LISTENING AND FOR THOSE WATCHING THE TYMPANIC IS NOT IN A BED THE PINA THAT THIS PART OF THE EAR THE OUTER PART OF THE OTHE TYMPANIC AS CAN BE NEAR THE TALL HEADY TOWARDS THE TYMPANIC MEMORY AN A YES I'M STICKING MY FINGER IN MY EAR BECAUSE THAT'S A WHERE IT THE LAZER WE'D ACTUALLY HAVE I TO GO TO MEASURE YOUR TIPERATURE  SO WHEN WE'RE WALKING INTO RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PLACES NOWADAYS AN THEIR SHINING THE LAZER AT OUR FOREHEAD THAT'S PROBABLY GIVING A PRETTY CRUDE READ OUT OF TEMPERATURE IT IS BUT THERE'S MUCH LESS INSOLATION BETWEEN YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR FOREHEAD SKIN THAN THERE IS BETWEEN YOUR BISEPS AND YOUR ARMSKIN SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO MEASURE A SURFACE TEMPERATURE THAT'S WHERE YOUD DO IT AND WE DO TEMPERATURES IN THE IN FOR RED WE WE TAKE IN FOR RED VIDIOS OF ATHLETES AND AND ARE OUR SUBJECTS AND OF COURSE THE FACE LIGHTS UP  E SOF WE'RE NOT I IMAGINE THERE'S CAN BE A TECHNOLOGY COMING SOON WHERE YOU CAN POINT YOUR AM SMART WATCH ARE YOUR SMART FONING YOURSELF AN YOU'RE GOING TO GET A HEAT MAN RIGHT THAT'S GOT IF IF SOMEBODY OUT THERE HASN'T ALREADY INVENTED THIS UT FOR THE TYPICAL FOLKS OUTSIDE MILITARY SOMEBODY PLEASE INVENT THAT BECAUSE A I THINK THERE'S GROWING INTEREST IN TEMPERATURE A BASED ON THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AN ALSO FORSAKE OF COM SOMETHING I DO WANT A TOUCH ON WHICH IS SLEEP IN METABOLISM ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANT TO OPEN UP THOSE PORTALS ALL THE WAY BECAUSE WE NEED A SEVERAL DAYS TO COVER IT A O GES SO PUTTING ON THE THE CAP AM WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE HELMETS AND GLOVES THAT ARE USED IN TYPICAL SPORTS DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE CAN BE IMPROVED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF THEIR VENTILATION ABILITY OR KEEPING PALMER SURFACES A OPEN FOR INSTANCE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE THE KNIT CAP IN IN COLD WEATHER ESPECIALLY AND THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE YOU DO LOSE A LOT OF HEAT FROM YOUR HEAD A BUT IT'S A CONSTANT HEAT LOST IT'S NOT VARIABLE LIKE YOUR GLABORA SKIN SO A IF YOU DECREASE THAT HEAT LOSS YOU'RE GOING TO BE WARMER SO SURE THAT THAT THAT HASN'T IMPACT NOW IN TERMS OF HELMETS  THEY SHOULD BE AVENTILATED I MEAN THEY SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH A SPACE IN THEM AND HOLDS IN THEM SO THAT AIR CAN CIRCULATE YOU DON'T WANT TO INSOLATE ATHORMAGLY INSOLATE YOUR YOUR SCALP THAT'S GOING TO DECREASE HEAT LOSS QUITE CONSIDERABLE NOW JUST FOR ARRESTING INDIVIDUAL THE BRAIN IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF YOUR METABOLISM SO THAT'S THAT'S A LOT OF HEAT PRODUCTION Y ABSOLUTELY AM I REALIZE THERE IS A QUESTION THAT I FAIL TO ASK EARLIER AM THAT IS I BURNING IN MY MIND NOW AND I THINK IS LIKELY BURNIN IN THE MINDS OF FSOME OF THE LISTENERS WHICH IS SO YOU IF YOU DO THIS COOLING IN BETWEEN SETS IN THE GIM THE ETHER HE PERFORMANCE ENHANCING A FATM YOU DON'T GET THO DELAYED ON SET MUSCLE SORNESS WHICH IS GREAT SO PRESUMABLY THE BODY IS ADAPTING E GETTING BETTER AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF BEING ABLE TO DO MORE WORK EFTER UNUTE TIME OR TO GO HARDER IN SOME RAY OF COURSE AM YOU GET THAT ADAPTATION DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU SEE A PERFORMANCE ENHANCING A FACT EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T COOL IF YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY DONE THE COOLING WORK OUTS YOU KNO PRINCS LET SAY I CAN DO TEN SETS OF TEN DIPTS WHICH I I LIKE TO THINK I CAN AY GET YOU TO GO TRY IT OR KNOW IF I'VE DONE THAT RECENTLY I DO THE COOLING ID I COOL FOR THREE MINUTES BETWEEN SETS AND LET'S SAY I I GET TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN DOU YOUR TWENTY FOR TEN SETS O'M TENSETS OF TWENTY REPETITIONS AND THEN I DON'T COOL WILL I BE ABLE TO MATCH OR APPROXIMATE MY NEW BETTER PERFORMANCE YOU KEEP YOUR GAMES IT'S A TRUE CONDITIONING EFFECT YOU RESPOND TO THE INCREASED WORK VOLUME BY ALL OF THOSE ME MECHANISMS YOU MENTIONED MAY S YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTAL ELEMENTS IN YOUR MUSCLES MAY MUSCLES GET BIGGER AMAZING  WE HAD AN EXPERIMENT HAT INVOLVES SOME OF OUR FEMALE A STUDENTS NOT ATLETES BUT JUST REGULAR THEY REFRESHMEN ACTUALLY AND A THE EXPERIMENT WAS A TEN SETS OF PUSH UPS TO MUSCLE FAILURE WHITHER WITHOUT COOLING SAME REGIMEN THREE MINUTES OF OF COOLING IN BETWEEN SETS OF PUSH UP OHSOME OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES REACHED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PUSH UPS NOW THE TOTAL DURATION OF THE WORK OUT COAN BE GETTING MUCH LONGER AS HE COMNO THE DOING MORMER NO IT DOESN'T TAKE YOU LONGER WELL MINER I MEAN A PUSHUP IS PRETTY FAYESITY FANOW SO YOU DO TEN SETS THE MAXIMUM AN FORTY FIVE MINUTES TOTAL AN MHOST LOT THAT'S A LOT OF PUSHOP THAT'S A LOT OF PUSH OMS NOW  SO THE INTERESTING THING IS THEY CAME IN ONE DAY AND THEY SAID DOCTOR HELLOR YOU COST US A LOT OF MONEY WHY WE HAD A FORMAL DENTE THIS WEEK AND WE ALL HAD TO BUY NEW SLEEVELESS DRESS IS NICE TO GET TRON HA GOOD PROM TO HAVE AM LET'S TELL ABOUT STEROIDS ANABAL EC TEROIDS AM WE'RE HEADING INTO AN OLYMPICS AEVERY TIME THE OLYMPICS ROLLS AROUND HERE ABOUT THESE CASES OF PEOPLE GETTING POP OES THEY CALL IT OR CAUGHT FOR ANABAL EC STEROIDS THERES SOME ACCUSATIONS OUT THERE NOW THERE'LL BE AT MORE THEY'LL THIS WILL GET AM YOU KNOW HANDLED IN THE PRESS AND AND THE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS CLEARLY ATHLETES AND NON ATHLETES USE ANABOLIC STEROIDS AND TYPICALLY ANABOLIC STEROIDS ARE OF THE TESTOSTERONE VARIETY THERE ARE DERIVATIVES ET CETERA AND THOSE DERIVATIVES DO DIFFERENT THINGS IN ANABOLICERS INTERGENIC ET CETERA BUT TIPICALLY THE IDEA IS AS LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN TALKING TO SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AM IS THAT THEY ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRAIN MORE BECAUSE THEY RECOVER FASTER THEY ARE ABLE TO SYMTHASIZE MORE PROTINE BECAUSE THEY'RE BASICALLY GETTING A SECOND PUBERITY BECAUSE AS WE ALL NO DRINK PUBERTY THERE'S A LOT OF GROWTH OF THE BODY AM AND OF COURSE THERARE A LOT OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ABUSE OF THESE THINGS AND THEY ARE BANNED FROM FROM VERY SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY I SHOULD MENTIONIN COMBAT SPORTS IT'S IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING BECAUSE IN COMBAT SPORTS A PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT MEANS THAT YOU CAN HARM SOMEBODY MORE THAN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO OTHERWISE I SUPPOSE TON OTHER SUCH SORTS OF SPORTS JUST TO CONCEPTIOALIZE IT AND A MEN I'M NOT TAKING A MORAL STANCE ON ANY OF THIS I JUST WANT IN ASK YOU WHEN YOU COMPARE PALMER COOLING TO ANIBAL EC STEROIDS IN TERMS OF JIM PERFORMANCE WHAT DO YOU SEE WELL WE DO NOT DO RESEARCH ON STEROIDS BUT THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THE LITERATURE A LOT OF THAT AS RESEARCH IN THE STRENGTH CONDITIONING MAGAZINES IS NOT VERY SCIENTIFIC NOBE WER MY NI NANE BE SCIENTIFIC AT ALRIGHT RIGHT BUT WE DID DO AN ANALYSIS OF REPUTABLE PAPERS AND WE DID FIND A I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY EIGHT OR NINE TEN STUDIES ON BENCH PRESS AINCREASE IN BENCH PRESS PERFORMANCE ON STEROIDS OR NOT THE OTO MALES OR FEMALES WELL WELL THIS WERE ALL MALES BUT I'LL GET BACK TO THE FEMALES ATHE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IN ALL OF THESE INDEPENDENT STUDIES THEIRE RATE OF IMPROVEMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY ONE PER CENT PER WEEK NOW I'VE JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT STUDIES IN WHICH WE'VE HAD THREE HUNDRED PER CENT INCREASE IN A MONTHS ISO IT'S AN ENORMOUS YET ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE SO SO WHY WOULD YOU ENDANGER YOUR HEALTH AS WELL AS YOUR OR LEGAL ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH SUCH AN INEFFECTIVE TOOL YOW NO I I THINK IT'S THE THE NOTION OF PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IS IS A REALLY INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE PEOPLE CLEARLY PAY ATTENTION O NTRITIAN SLEEP IS NOWOF SOMETHING THAT I THINK EVERYBODY BUT ESPECIALLY ATHLETES ARE PAYING ATTENTION TOR AM AND I PREDICT THAT TEMPERATURE WILL BE ONE OF THE MORE M POWERFUL A PARAMETERS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSSING ON YE IT'S BECAUSE IT BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECTS THAT YOURE DESCRIBING AND AND ALSO BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE VERYABILITY AROUND PERFORMANCE AS YOU MENTION HAS TO DO WITH WHEN YOU GO TO A NEW ENVIRONMENT YO EVERYONE HAS THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL SLEEP WELL IN YOUR OWN BED AT HOME YOU WHEN YOU CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING YOUR PERFORMANCE IS ALWAYS GREAT THIS WITHING MILITARY SPECIAL OPERATORS ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING GROUP BECAUSE THEIR WHOLE WORLD IS CENTERED AROUND ILEAT AND HI PERFORMANCE AT WITH VERY HIGH RISK HIGH CONSEQUENCE UNDER VARIABLE CONDITIONS THE ESSENCE OF THEIR WORK IS VARIABLE UNPREDICTABLE CONDITIONS SO AM YOU MENTION FEMALE ATHLETES AND GENEROYS I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THIS YOW BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS ALWAYS SAID TO US WHELL YOU ONLY USE MALE SUBJECTS AND OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE THIS TESTOSTRON BACKGROUND U KNOW THEY HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF DESTALSTRON THAT'S WHY YOU GET THESE RESULTS SO WE DID A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON FEMALES WE GET THE SAME RESULTS IMPRESSIVE AND THESE ARE ARE STAMFORD ATHLETES OR ALSO THESE WERE NOT STANFOR OU THEY WERE STAMFORD STUDENTS BUT NOT ATHLETE WO WE WE HAVE DONE OF COURSE WORK ON SOME ATHLETES BUT IN GENERAL WE DON'T DO RESEARCH ON OUR TEAMS ARE OUR CITY TEAMS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PROTOCAULS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TRAINING PROGRAE AT THEY DON'T LIKE US TO GET THEYTHEY DON'T KNO WORK WIT SOME OF THESE FOLKS AND THE COACHES AND THER VERY SCEPTU WITH GOOD REASON ALSO AND THE REASON I ASK IS THAT I I WHEN YOU SEE THESE A PACKTEN OR OR DIVISION ONE COLLEGE ATHLETES AND THEN YOU SEE THEIR PEERS HAV BIT THERE'S THERE'S CLEARLY A A A A DIFFERENCE RIHTE A MINAT THEY THEY ARE PAT AGREED AT THROUGHOUT RIGHT AM AND MORE TYPICAL FOLKS A ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT GOLDS FTHEY MAY NOT WANT TO GET INFINITELY STRONGER  OR PERFORM MORE ENDURANCE WORK TI WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT SHIVERING AND METABOLISM CAUSE I THINK THERE VERY INTERESTING AND AM SUFFICIENTLY RELATED SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SHIVER IS AN ADAPTATION THAT'S DESIGN TO HEAT US UP IF A THAT WE HAVE BROWN FAT THAT'S IN COMPARTMENTS AROUND OUR BODY THAT ARE ACTIVATED BY SHIVER OR COACTIVATED BY SHIVER AND THAT SHIVERING IS USEFUL FOR INCREASING METABOLISM IS THAT TRUE AND DOES IT REQUIRE THAT COLD BE THE STIMULUS SO TO TWOSONARIOS I'LLGIVE YOU EXPR EMENT I PUT SOME ONE INTO COLD WATER OF SOME SORT AND THEN I MAKE THEM GET OUT OR I HAVE THEM STAND NEAR AND THEN THEY START SHIVERING MINOURSTANDING IS THAT THER THEIR METABOLISM WILL INCREASE WHAT IF I TAKE SOMEONE AND I JUST HAVE THEM SHIVER BUT THEYARE NOT EXPOSED BY COSE KIND OF A DELIBERATE SHIVERING WILL THAT ALSO CREATE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN METABOLISM SURE SO DELIBERATE SHIVERING WITHOUT COLD IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A FEVER YOUR SET POINT GOES UP IN YOUR HYPOTHALAMUS AND YOU ACTUALLY EVEN KNOW YOUR NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE YOUR THERMISTAT IS TELLING YOU YOU'RE TOO COLD INCREASE YOUR METABOLISMS OR SHIVER SO SURE SHIVERING IS A IS A GOOD WAY OF INCREASING METABOLISM BUT IT ONLY CAN TAKE METABOLISM UP MAY BE THREE OR FOUR TIMES RESTING THES WHERE IS A EXERCISE CAN TAKE YOU UP WEL TEN TIMES GOT IT I DON'T ASK A COUPLE OF MORE RANDOM QUESTIONS AND A SEEMINGLY RANDOM DO BEARS ACTUALLY HIBERNATE OH YET THE TRUE HIBERNATION WELL TENSON HOW YOU TO FIND TRUE A A BEAR ACTIALLY WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON BEARS WE WEE DO YOU ALSO PUT THE NOSE THERMAL COUPLE DOWN IN THE ASAFO  WE EMPLANT THEM SURGICALLY THER ANACETIZE WHEN YOU RE INPLAND THE YES LOOK KIND OF BEARS AN BLACK BEARS AND DID THIS WITH COLLEAGUES AT UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA AN D WERE ANALYZING THE DATA NOW BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE AS WE'VE WEVE HAD NOW A TOTAL OF EIGHTEEN BEARS AND WE INPLANT THEM WITH E E G E G G A TEMPERATURE CENSERS AND SOMETIMES WE HACTUALLY MEASURE THEIR OXYGEN CONSUMPTION THESE ARE BEARS IN THE WILE THESE ARE BEARS IN THE WIRE BUT THEY'RE BROUGHT IN A TO UNIVERSI OF ALASKA WHERE WE KEEP THEM IN AN OUTDOOR ENCLOSURE SO THEIR HYBERNATING IN AN ESTPOX IN A ENCLOSURE AND WE'RE RECORDING THIS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DATE TO CONTINUOUSLY FOR SIX MONTHS MAZING HOW DON'T I GET ON THIS PARTICON E CANNOIGAN IRGINGS OM WORK TOGETHER GOING FORWARD AND TEN YOU CAN SLADEME ON T O THIS PHROTOCLASE YOURIGHTS I RIGHT NOW IT'S A MATTER OF JUST ANALYZING THE GIGABITES TERRABITES OF DATA THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED SO BUT ANYWAY YOU ASKED ABOUT HYBERNATION SO A BEARS ONLY GO DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOUR DEGREE CENEGRADE COR TEMPERATSURE AND THAT'S BEEN ARGUED THAT WELL THEY CAN'T GO LOWER BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH IN SOLATION THEIR SO BIG THEIR SURFACE VOLUME RAY SHO AND SO FORTH AND THAT'S NOT TRUE THEY SHIVER SO IF IF WE HAVE A DAY LIKE A MINUS FORTY WHICH YOU GET IN IN ALASKA THEY WILL GO THROUGH PERIODS OF SHIVERING AND MAINTAIN A COR TEMPERATURE ON THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOR NOW THE GROUND SQUIRRELS AND THE MARMETS WHICH ARE SMALL SMALLER ANIMALS ATHEY WILL DROP DOWN TO A BODY TEMPERATURE AMAYBE WITHIN A DEGREE OF THE ENVIRONMENT SO THEY CAN GO DOWN TO ONE OR TWO DEGREE CENEGRATE JUST ABOVE FREEZING ADORING BAL S OF HIBERNATION SO THEY'LL STAY IN HIBRNATION FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS AND LHOL COME BACK UP TO NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE FOR A DAY THAN LOO GO BACK DOWN AND WHAT AN THE OTHER JOIN THAT DAY WHEN THEY'RE WARMING OUP AGAIN THEE REARRANGE THEIR NEST A EAT IF THEY'VE STORED FOOD SOME SPECIES STORE LOTS OF FOOD OTHERS JUST DEPEND ON THEIR FAT A A FORMER MENTOR MY MY MY MASTERS TO REMENTER AND A A COLLEAGUAN FRIONT OF YOURS ERVING ZOOKER YOU SEE MURGLY TOLD ME A STORY ONCE TOLL ME A LAW STORIES TELLS GREAT STORIES AS YOU KNOW HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN AN ANIMAL COMES OUT OF HIGBERNATION PERIODICALLY THAT IT'S A VERY DRAMATIC THING TO OBSERVE THAT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WAKE UP IN YAWN AND LOOK AROUND BUT IT'S LIKE I LIKE A COMPLETE EPOLEPTIC SEIZSURE WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO SHIVERING IT'S JUST A RESGERRAMATIC SHIVER SO AT THE LOW TEMPERATURES THEY CANNOT SHIVER BECAUSE THE FECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE CONDUCTION OF THE OF THE NERVES AND THE MUSCLE FASO THEY'RE SHUTTE DOWN BASI CU SO NOW SO THERE THEY USE BROWN FAT SO ACTIVE ATE BROWN FAT AND THEN WHEN THEY GET UP TO A TEMPERATURE OF MAY BE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DEGREES CENTEGRATE THAN THE SHIVERING STARTS AND IT GETS VERY VERY VIOLENT BUT THEY'RE STILL ASLEEP DO WE SHIVER IN OUR SLEEP I WOULD IMAGINE WE DO BUT IT PROBABLY WAKES US UP INTERESTING SO THE BROWN FAT IS KIND OF LIKE KINDLING THE BROWN FAT IS A A TISSUE WHICH HAS LOTS OF STORED ENERGY CAUSE IT'S FAT BUT UNLIKE OUR WHITE FAT ARE REGULAR FAT IT ALSO HAS LOTS OF THESE LITTLE POWER HOUSES MIGHT O CONDRIA AND LOTS OF BLOOD SUPPLY SO ESSENTIALLY IT IS A TISSUE JUST TO PRODUCE HEAT THAT'S WHAT IT'S THERE FOR NOW IN THESE HIBERNATERS THERE ARE BIG PATCHES OF BROWN FAT AT SERTAIN LOCATIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL LIKE AROUND THE HEART FOR EXAMPLE A FOR US THE BROWN FAT IS SORT OF DISTRIBUTE IT SO FOR MANY MANY YEARS IT WAS THOUGHT HUMAN STON'T HAVE BROWN FAT BUT INDEED WE DO IT'S JUST NOT LOCALIZED IN TO DISCREET FAT PADS LIKE IT IS IN A GROWND SQUIRRELS MARMITS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE PHRASE FAT PATS IS SO SATISFYING TO SAY BUT IT IS FAT PADS OM SPEAKING OF FAT PADS A I WAS TAUGHT THAT WE HAVE BY THE INTERNET I SHOULD SAY NOT BY THE INTERNAT THAT WE HAVE BROWN FAT BETWEEN OUR SCAP ULAE IN OUR UPPER NECK IS IS THAT TRULY A SOURCE OF BROWN ENRICHMENT FOR BROWN FAT IF YOU'RE GROWN SQUIRREL SO IT'S COMPLETE THIS IS ALL THE DRAWINGS OUT THERE OCASE SO WHEN I'M WHE I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT BROWN FAT AS ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED IN PATIN HUMAN US DISTRIBUTED ALONG WITH OTHER A FAT TISSUE IT'S IT'S NOT AS DISCREET IS THE REASON I'M I'M CAN A SHOCKED AND AMUSED AND UM A TROUBLED BY THIS IS BECAUSE THEYRE IS A SOMEWHAT STANDARD PROTOCALL IN THE E PERFORMANCE WELL NESS WHATEVER A WORLD WHAT EVERYONE O CALL IT OF PUTTING ICE PACKS ON THE UPPER BACK AS HE WAY TO STIMULATE BROWN FAT THERMOGENISIS IM I'M HEARING SOME SOME A INHAILS OF CONCERN FROM FROM THE PHYSIOLOGIST SO TELL ME WHY IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WAY TO STIMULATE BROWN FAT ACTIVATION WELL 'S PUT IT THIS WAY YOU'RE NOT ATTACKING ANYONE YES ETICALLY BECAUSE THE WHOLE YEL BELIEVES THIS SO DON LIT UT IT MAY NOT BE TOTALLY AN PACITIAR FALSE A THINK OF WHAT THAT'S DOING IF YOU PUT ICE RIGHT THERE WHERE YOU'RE SPINAL CORD IS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE THAT'S WHERE YOUARE GOING TO HIT THE VERTEBRAL ARTERIES SO YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY PUTTING A COLD SOURCE INTO THE BRAIN TO THE HYPOTHOLEMIS HYPATHOLEMIS SAYS YOU'RE TO A COLD SO IT IS GOING TO TURN ON SHIVERING AND AROUND FAT SO WOULD THERE BE A BETTER SIGHT FORSAKE OF ACTIVATING BROWN FAT A PALMER COOLY A YOU KNOW I I CAN'T SAY BECAUSE THE ACTIVATION OF BROWN FAT IS SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM RESPONSE SO ANY LOWERING OF COUR TEMPERATURE THAT WILL LET THE THERMIS THAT SAY YOU'RE TOO COLD IS GOING TO TURN ON SYMPATHETIC NOW PEOPLE WILL HAVE PERHAPS DIFFERENT A MOUNCE OF BROWN FAT SO  A NEW BORN HAVE MORE BROWN FAT AND AT AL CAUSE THE BLUEBORNS CAN'T SHIVER CORRECT I DON'T KNOW OKE THAT'SO THAT' WHAT I READ I DON'T KNOW YET  AN I REARIDE THA I READ THAT IN WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE CREDIBLE SOURCES IT COULD BE II JUST DON'T KNOW IT DEPENDS ON IF IT'S REALLY NEW BORN I CAN AGREE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE A MOTOR PATHWAYS CONNECTED UP YEET IT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OCCURS IN EARLY A DAYS OF LIFE AND IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF REM SLEEP A A WHICH INFANTS HAVE A LOT OF RIGHT EBUT HOW TO ACTIVATE BROWN FAT IF YOU ARE CONSISTENTLY EXPOSED TO COLD SO IF YOU LIVE IN THE ARCTIC AN YOU GO OUT JOGGING IN THE WINTER IT MAYBE THAT WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BROWN FAT YOU HAVE IF YOU LIVE IN THE TROPICS MAYBE YOU HAVE LESS PRO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW OF ANY STUDIES WHICH HAVE LOOKED INTO THAT N ICE HEADACHE SOMETIMES I'LL DRINK A COLD BEVERAGE ARE ALL A EAT ICE CREAM IN MY HEAD WILL BRAINS FREE LIT IS BRAIN FREES AND SPEAKING SPECIAL FORCES I STACKING I A YOU KNOW WE ALL SEE THE IMAGES AT THE SEALS SEAL TRAINING SLASH A SCREENING IN CORONADO WHERE THERE GOING IN INOW THE PACIFIC WHICH IS VERY COLD BUT A I KNOW THEY ALSO SPEND SOME TIME IN THE VERY COLD WATERS OF CODIAC ALASKA YOU MENTION ALASKA A BRAIN FREEZE SO CALLED ICE HEADACHE IS A A COMMON OCCURRENCE THERE O IN THO SITUATIONS BUT WE ALL EXPERIENCE THUS WE ICE SCREAMYO GET THAT BRAIN FREES I CAN FEEL IT RINOW OH IT SUBJECTIVELY I CAN INDUCE IT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND UM I YOU WOULD ALWAYS JUST RUB MY TONGUE ON THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH IS THERE SOMETHING THIT'M DOING THAT'S A FUNCTIONAL THERE JUST TO TRY AN ALLEVIATIT A GOOD QUESTION THE THING IS THAT THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH IS VERY CLOSE TO YOUR HYPOTHELEMUS SO IF INDEED IT'S A POPSYCLE THAT'S GIVING YOU THE BRAIN FREES IT MAY BE ADIRECT COOLING EFFECT FROM THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH YOU PUT YOUR TONGUE THERE YOUR INSULATING THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH I DON'T KNOW I'M GUESS T BUT WHAT'S IT BUT THE SORT WHAT'S THE SOURCE OF THE BRAIN FREES IS IT AT VASO CONSTRICTION IT IT'S A IT IT' IT'S A VASAMOTOR CHANGE WHETHER IT'S CONSTRICTION I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY OF ASO AN INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE WHICH WILL ESSENTIALLY CAUSE AN EXPANSION OF THE ARTERIES AND AACTIV A PAIN RECEPTORS WE DON'T HAVE PAIN RECEPTORS IN THE NURAL TISSUE IN THE BRAIN WE HAVE THEM IN THE MENINGIES AND PREDOMINANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE THE BLOOD VESSELS THE WALLS OF THE BLOOD VESSELS SO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE AWERE BLOOD PRESSURE GOING TO THE BRAIN YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET WE'VE HAD SOME PRELIMINARY DATA I EVEN HATE TO MENTION THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PURSUE IT SYSTEMATICALLY BUT WE'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE WITH MY GRAIN THAT SAY IF THEY USE ONE OF OUR DEVOYT DEVICES TO HEAT THAT THE MY GRAIN GOES AWAY AND ADON'T KNOW THE IHE'S BERIANGE A LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFER FROM MY GRAIN ANDOTHER LOTED TO FRE HOT TYPES OF MY GRAIN RI BEEN READING A LOT ABOUT THIS LATELY BECAUSE I GET SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MY GRAIN M BUT I HATE TO SAY ANYTHING SURE AND AND WE'LL DIS UNDERSCORE THIS IS PRELIMINARY AA PEOPLE ARE HAVE BEEN GREAT ABOUT AM UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WE SAY PRELIMINARY WE MEAN AS NOT PASS THROUGH THE THE UM REQUIRED PHILTERS TO CALL IT  HART HARD FACT YEY BUT YO DON'T WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A DECENT DATA SET JUSTIS THESE ARE ANECDOTE REWOR ANECDATA AND  LIKE TOO WHAT I ON'T YOUVEN LIKE TO CALL IT THAT BECAUSE THEN IF YOU WE DONT WANT TO GIVE IT MORE WEIGHT THAN IT DESERVES BUT THAT'S INTERESTING M THE ICE HEADACHE AND THE INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURES INTERESTING BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT I'VE HEARD IS SIMILAR TO IT I'S SOMETHING THAT UM COMES FROM YOU NOTHY F THESE COMPETITIONS WHERE PEOPLE EAT THESE VERY HOT CHILLY PEPPERS YET'S CANABON YAN EGO THING I GUESS UM FOR REASONS THAT THAT ESCAPE ME THAT EATING REALLY HOT PEPPERS IN EVERY ONCE IN A LHILE SOME WILL EAT ONE OF THESE AND GET WHAT'S CALLED THUNDER CLAP HEADACHE WHERE A HEADACHE COMES ON EXTREMELY QUICKLY AND SO QUICKLY THAT IT'S CAUSED NIS SO SEVERE RATHER THAT IT'S BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE STROKE AND BRAIN DAMAGE SO THESE VERY VERY VERY HOT PEPPERS IF YOU'RE NOT ACCLAMATED TO THEM AND MAYB EVEN IF YOU ARE HAVE BEEN CHON TA TO CAUSE ASHICOS AL RAIN DAMAGE YE SOME GOOD EVIDENCE FOR THIS A I DO WANT O TALK ABOUT A SOMETHING THAT WE WER HAVE NOT TOUCHED ON YET WHICH IS NEAT NON EXERCISE INDUCED THERMOGENESIS RIGHT THE AN SO NON ACTIVITY ASSOCIATE THERMOGASIS AND THE FIDGETERS RIGHT SO THAT THE CLASSIC WORK OF LIKE ROTHWELL IN STOCK AND THE IDEA THAT SOMETPEOPLE WHO OVEREAT ARE BURNING OFF THAT ENERGY BY WAY OF SHAKING THEIR KNEE ARE MOVING AROUND ALONTHIES OF THE KIND ANER THEY QUOTE YOU UNDERQUON QUOT NERVOUS TYPES BUT A THEY QUOTED IN THOSE STUDYIES A HUGE DEGREE OF COLORIC BURN YOU KNOW EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALORIES PERDAY BURNED ABOVE THOSE WHO SIT RATHER STILL DOES THAT SEEM FAR FETCH THOSE ARE OLDER DATA BUT ANY ANY COMMENT ON MEAT AR NON EXERCISE INDUCED A THERMOGENESIS WELL I DO THINK IT'S A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT IF YOU INCREASE MUSCLE ACTIVITY OF ANY KIND YOU'R INCREASING YOURE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND YOUR HEAT PRODUCTION AND NOW THE THE REALLY EXTREME EXAMPLE IS HYPER AND HYPOTHIROIDISM A PEOPLE THEIR HYPERTHIROITER FIDGETY  OU KNOW THEY HAVE VERY METABOLICRIT AND THE'RE HOT AND PEOPLE THEIR HYPOTHERMIC ARE COOL THERE NOT THEY DON'T MOVE VERY MUCH SO ANY KIND OF MUSCLE ACTIVITY INCREASES AND WHEN YOU SAY NOW IT'S NOT MUCH ACTIVITY BUT REMEMBER IT'S ONLY TWENTY PER CENT EFFECTIVE EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE ENERGY IS GOING TO HEAT SO IT MAY NOT EXERT MUCH ENERGY TO TAP YOUR FOOOT BUT FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THIT IS GOING INTO THE MOVEMENT IS BEING LOST IS HEAT THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING COPLEMORE QUICK QUESTIONS THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT THESE DAYS OR AT LESE USAGE THESE DAYS OF SO CALLED ENERGY DRINKS FREE WORK OUT DRINKS MANY OF THESE CONTAIN THERMOGENIC COMPOUND O CAFINE THINGS THERE'S A A CULTURE NOW OF TAKING A ARGENINE NOTHINGS THAT SUPPORT ARGENINE SO YOU KNOW BEAT JEW AND A A HEY'LL SITUULINE THINGS TO DILATE THE BLOOD VESSELS SOMETIMES THIS IS FOR SAKE OF OF INCREASING BLOOD FLOAD OF THE MUSCLES DURING RESISTANCE EXERCISED BUT A LOT OF THESE ARE THERMOGANIC IT'S THE INCREASE BODY TEMPERATURE AND ARSE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE ENERGY DRINKS ARE ACTUALLY A WORE SIMILAR YOU KNOW SIXASPRASSOER WHATNEVER IT IS ARE ACTING TO PREVENT OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE A REDUCED PERFORMANCE I DON'T THINK THAT THE THE TEMPERATURE RISE IS THAT IDREALLY DON'T KNOW A BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES YOU MORE GITTERY AND YOUARE GOING TO INCREASE THAT NEAT THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A DUREIS ANOTHER THING AND THAT IS THAT A WHEN YOU ARE EXERCISING YOUR MUSCLE AND IT BECOMES SLIGHTLY A HYPOXIC MEAN IS THE OXYGEN SUPPLIES IS IS NOT ENOUGH THE MUSCLE RELEASES A DENISINE AND WHAT A DENISINE DOES IN THE MUSCLE IS CAUSE THE BLOOD VESSELS TO OPEN UP TO DILATE SO IT'S A WAY OF INCREASING THE BLOOD FLOW TO THE MUSCLE AND THEREFORE THE OXYGEN SUPPLY TO THE MUSCLE SO HAFFINE AND IS AN A ESSENTIALLY AN A DENICINE AN AGANISING ANTAGONIST SO IN SO IF THE UNDER THE STRICT LOGIC IN GESTING KAFFINE WILL REDUCE A DENIZINE RELEASE AND WERE WILL REDUCE OXYGEN UTILIZATION OF THE MUSCLE RIGHT SO THAT WOULD LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT MOTIVATIONAL SUPPORT ASIDE THAT KAFFINE WILL HINDER MUSCULAR PERFORMANCE I WOULD THINK SO BUT I I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN AUTHORITATIV ANSWER OF THAT A WERE JUST WHAT WERE JUST I'M GOING THROUGH THE ET THE LOGIC IN THE GYMNASTICS AROUND THAT UM I THINK IT'S A FASCINATING AREA THAT THAT DESERVES ATTENTION BECAUSE  THE QUESTION OF WHAT ONE CAN INGJEST IN ORDER TO PERFORM BETTER TO SAY NOTHING OF UNIHORMAL AUGMENTATION BUT A HAS OFTEN LEADS BACK TO STIMULANTS AND IF THOSE STIMULANTS MUST OF WHICH INCLUDE KAFFINE OF SOME SORT OR INHIBITING THE ADENICINE SYSTEM AND THE ADENZING SYSTEM IS SUPPORTING THE OXYGENATION OF MUSCLE THEN I WOULD IMAGIN THAT AVOIDING THEM MIGHT BE THE BETTER OPTION I JUST AM NOT AWARE OF  DATA THAT WOULD SO THIS IS A GENERAL PHENOMENON OF THE DENIZINE AND AND BLOODFOT HAS OF COURSE A DIFFERENT EFFECT IN THE BRAIN A DENIZIN CAUSEA SLEEP SO KAFFINE KEEPS YOU AWAKE AND IF YOU STAY AWAKE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHER MEN OF OLIC GRATE THAN IFHOW GO TO SLEEP SO NTETHING AS YOU SAY ENERGY DRINKS THE QUESTION IS IN OF WHAT REALLY IS IT IS IN THEM WIT'S USUALLY A COCKTAIL OF THINGS AM I DON'T TAKE THESE I DON'T LIKE THEM AT ALL BUT THERE USUALLY A COMBINATION OF VEZA DILATORS STIMUL KAFFINE SOME SORT OF STAN A SOURCE OF GLUCOS YOU SOMETIMES HA SORCE OF GLUCOSE AND SOMETIMES NOT AND OFTEN TIMES THERE ARE UM THERE ARE VESA DILATORS NAM AND THERE ARE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE SO CALLED THE NEUTROPICS MART DRUGS THAT BASICALLY INCREASE A SEATO CALLING OR IDNOR U AN AFFERENTREN THAT TRANSMISSION AM YOU KNOWIN THAT IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES OM THE BATA THREE AGONISTS LIKE CLAMBUTAR ALL WERE VERY POPULAR BUT THEY WERE ALL BAND THOSE ARE ALL BAND FROM FROM A ALTHOUGH PEOPLE USE THEM RECREATIONALLY WHICH I DO NOT RECOMMEND ITHERE ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF DEATHS DUE TO DEHYDRATION OVERHEATING AND AS WELL AS CARDIAIC EFFECTS AM BEFORE WE WRAP UP I I KNOW YOU'VE DONE A TON OF WORK ON SLEEP I THINK WERE CAN HAVE TO DO ANOTHER EPISODE ABOUT YOUR WORK ON SLEEP BECAUSE YOU THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT YOU PRODUCE THER IS V AST ACTUALLY SO I FIRST GOT TO KNOW YOU IN YOUR WORK AM ARELATE TO SLEEP IN TEMPERATURE WE ALL HERE NOWADAYS THAT IT'S GOOD TO KEE THE ROOM THAT YOU SLEEP IN COOL KEEP IT DARK I'VE TALKED A NUMBER OF TIMES ON POTCASTS EPISODES ABOUT I'M THE ROLE OF LIGHT IN SHIFTING IT CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS RELATED TO SLEEP ONE IS ARE THERE ANY THING THAT MAYOR MAY NOT RELATE TO TEMPERATURE BUT THAT YOU THINK ARE VERY USEFUL FOOR GETTING BETTER SLEEP THAT YOU DON'T HEAR THAT MUCH ABOUT IM THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT A CONSIDER OR TRY REALIZING THAT THERE LOTTERIES THAT WY PEOPLE DON'T SLEEM IT GREAT BUT WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU DON'T HER THAT MUCH ABOUT THESE DAYS THAT YOU WISH PEOPLE KNEW WELL THE SLEEP MEDICINE COMMUNITY NOW PUTS A LOT MORE EMPHASIS ON COGNATIVE BEHAVIOUR AUTHERAPY THEN ON PHARMACOLOGY SO WHAT COGNAED BEHAVIOUR OTHERAPY DOES IS IT ESSENTIALLY INCREASES YOUR SLEEP HYGINE SO THERE ARE CERTAIN JUST GENERAL RULES SO

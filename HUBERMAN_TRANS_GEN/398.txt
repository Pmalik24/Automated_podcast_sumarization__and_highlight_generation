WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LATPONCENS SO SCIENCE SCIENCEPAC TO FRLIFE I MA ENTRUHUBERMEN AND O PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING M D M A SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS ECSTASY OR MOLLY M D M A STANDS FOR METHELINE DIOXY METHEM PHEDEMINE THAT'S RIGHT YOU HEARD THE WORD METH M PHEDMINE IN THERE AND M D MA HAS PROPERTIES SIMILAR TO METHEM PHEDMINE BUT ALSO PROPERTIES THAT ARE VERY DISTINCT FROM METHEM PHEDEMINE JUST AS A SIDE NOTE METHEM PHEDEMINE IS A COMMONLY USED DRUG OF ABUSE IT IS AN ILICIT DRUG AND IT PRODUCES SOME OF THE GREATEST AND FASTEST INCREASES IN THE NEURMOGERLATOR DOPOMINE OF ANY AVAILABLE DRUGS ON THE STREET OR IN THE CLENIC AND BELIEVE ER NOT METHEM PHEDEMINE IS PRESCRIBED AS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG IN SOME VERY LIMITED CLINICAL USES M D M A METHELING DIOXY METHEM PHEDEMINE HAS PROPERTIES SIMILAR TO METHEM PHEDEMINE IN THAT IT POWERFULLY PROMOTES THE RELEASE OF DOPOMNE AND IT IS A STIMULANT AND YET IT ALSO POWERFULLY CONTROLS THE RELEASE OF SERETONAN AND IN DOING SO MAKES M D M A A DISTINCT CATEGORY OF COMPOUND FROM EITHER CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS LIKE SYLECIBON OR ELESTE WHICH LARGELY WORK ON THE SERETONAN SYSTEM AND TEND TO PRODUCE MISTICAL EXPERIENCES AND IT'S ALSO DISTINCT FROM PURE STIMULANTS SUCH AS METHEM PHEDEMINE BECAUSE M D M A BY PRODUCING BIG INCREASES IN BOTH DOPOMINE N SERETONAN ACTS AS WHAT'S CALLED AN IMPATHEGIN IT ACTUALLY CAN INCREASE ONE SENSE OF SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS AND MPATHY NOTJOUS FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT FOR ONES SELF AND IN THAT WAY M D M A IS COMMONLY USED AS A RECREATIONAL DRUG BUT ALSO IS NOW BEING TESTED AND IS ACHIEVING INCREDIBLE EARLY RESULTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ITS USE AS AN IMPATHAGN FOR THE TREATMENT OF P T S T INCLINICAL THERAPEUTIC SETINGS I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE M D MA IS STILL A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG THAT IS IT IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL TO POSSESS OR CELL IN THE UNITED STATES AND TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PATH THE LEGALITY THAT'S UNDER WAY WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF M D  MA AND WHY IT BECAME ILLEGAL AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECREATIONAL USE AND THERAPEUTIC USE AND THE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE STUDIES EXPLORING M D  MA IN THE CLINICAL SETTING FOR TE TREATMENT OF P T S T SO DURING TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT M D  MA REALLY IS HOW IT WORKS AT THE LEVEL OF NURONS WHICH BRAIN CIRCUITES IT ACTIVATES AND D ACTIVATES AND IN DOING SO YOU WILL COME TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS SO EXCITING AS A TREATMENT FOR P T S T WILL YOU WILL ALSO OF COURSE TALK ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THESE CLINICAL TRIALS USING M D  MA FOR THE TREATMENT OF P T S T THEY ARE INCREDIBLY EXCITING IN FACT THE FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY HAS NEVER BEFORE SEEN THE KIND OF SUCCESS IN TREATMENT OF P T S T WITH ANY OTHER COMPOUND THAT THEY ARE SEEING AND ACHIEVING WITH THE APPROPRIATE SAFE USE OF M D  MA AND WHEN I SAY APPROPRIATE THAT MEANS INCONJUNCTION WITH NINE THERAP SECTIONS SO THIS IS ANARIA THAT REALLY DESERVES SOME TIME FOR US TO DISCUSS BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECREATION ON THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF M D  MA WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT THE TOXICITY OF M D  MA THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE MANY OF YOU HAVE PERHAPS HEARD THAT M D MA QUOTAN QU PUTS HOLES IN YOUR BRAIN WERE KILL CERATONAN NURONS ARE KILLS DOPOME NURONS AND INDEED M D MA BECAUSE OF ITS SIMILARITY TO METHM PHEDAMIE WHICH IS HIGHLY NUROTOXIC M D MA CAN B NUROTOXIC HOWEVER THERE ARE WAYS TO USE M D  MA THERAPEUTICALLY THAT AVOID ITS TOXICITY AND YET THERE ARE STILL QUESTION S ABOUT ITS TOCTICITY AND ITS LONG TERM EFFECTS BOTH AFTER ACUTE USE MEANING JUST ONE TO THREE TIMES AS WELL AS CHRONIC USE MEANING PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN IT MANY MANY TIMES WILL TALK ABOUT THE SPACING BETWEEN SESSIONS OF EMDIA MA WE WILL TALK ABOUT DOSAGES WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO IN THAT CAN BE DONE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE POTENTIAL TOCTICITY OF M D  MA SO BY THE END OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU WILL HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MDIUM MAY IS WHAT IT ISN'T WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT WHAT IT DOES WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT WHAT IT DOESN'T DO AS WELL AS SOME OF THE STILL OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT M D MA THAT REMAIN TO BE RESOLVED BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SIMES RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACTOLECTOROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENTI DOK COM SLASH HUBERMAN LET'S TALK ABOUT M D MA M D MA OR ECSTASY IS A FASCINATING COMPOUND AND I SAY FASCINATING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ITS CHEMICAL STRUCTURE WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL I SAY FASCINATING BECAUSE IT HAS AN INCREDIBLE SET OF SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS IN TERMS OF HOW IT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL AND HAS A FASCINATING HISTORY SELISTIUS BRIEFLY START WITH THE HISTORY OF M D M M D M WAS SYMTHESIZED BY THE DRUG COMPANY MIRK IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS BUT IT ACTUALLY WAS NEVER APPLYD TO ANY PARTICULAR CLINICAL USE AND IT WAS IT REALLY EXPLORED MUCH IN ANY LABORATORIES AT ALL AND THEN IT WAS A LATER REDISCOVERED BYGO NAME ALEXANDER SCHULGAN WHO WAS A BIT OF A RENEGEDE DRUG CHEMIST WHO WAS DESIGNING DIFFERENT DRUGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF UNDERSTANDING THEIR SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS ON HUMANS SO THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF SCHULGAN DESIGNING DRUGS HE WAS AFTER ALL A CHEMIST AND THEN TAKING THOSE DRUGS HIMSELF AND THEN IF HE LIKED THE EFFECTS OF A PARTICULAR DRUG OR RATHER IF HE THOUGHT THAT IT HAD POTENTIAL CLINICAL UTILITY HE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIS WIFE THEN SHE WOULD GIVE HIM HER NOTES ABOUT THOSE DRUGS AND THEN THEY WOULD SHARE THEM WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND IT WAS A SMALL GROUP OF FRIENDS WHO CONSISTED OF THERAPISTS AND PHYSICIANS SO THIS WAS A REALLY UNDERGROUND KIND OF OPERATION IT WAS TECHNICALLY NOT ILLEGAL WHEN IT STARTED BECAUSE M D MA WASN'T ILLEGAL WHEN IT STARTED BUT OVER THE SEVERAL DECADES THAT SCHULGAN AND HIS WIFE AND THIS GROUP WERE DOING THIS KIND OF EXPLORATION M D MA DID BECOME ILLEGAL AND HE FELL UNDER ILL IS TU SAY SCRUTINY BY THE D IA NOW HERE'S THE IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT M  MA AND ITS HISTORY FIRST OF ALL M D MA IS A SYNTHETIC COMPOUND AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE IN NATURE SO UNLIKE SIMILAR COMPOUNDS SUCH AS MESCULINE BECAUSE M D MA AND MESCULINERARY SIMILAR IN THEIR CHEMICAL PROPERTIES AND TO SOME EXTENT THEIR SUBJECTIVE PROPERTIES UNLIKE MESCULIN WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN THE PLANT KINGDOM OR ELEST WHICH COMES FROM ERGOT OR SYLLICIBON WHICH OF COURSE CAN BE FOUND IN MAGIC MUSHROOMS M D  MA IS A UNIQUE CHEMICAL IN THAT AGAIN AS FAR AS WE KNOW ONLY EXISTS IN ITS SYNTHETIC FORM IT IS HUMAN MADE AND AS WE GET INTO THE CHEMICAL EFFECTS AND THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF M D  MA LUBIT LATER IN THE EPISODE I THINK YOUW'LL UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS SUCH A UNIQUE AND TO SOME EXTENT EXCITING COMPOUND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CLINICAL TREATMENT PUT DIFFERENTLY THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER COMPOUND THAT WE KNOW OF IN NATURE OR IN THE FHARMASUTICAL INDUSTRY SHELF OR OPTIONS OF DRUGS THAT AR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT PRODUCE THE KINDS OF EFFECTS THE M D  MA DOES AND BY THE WAY IF YOUR INTERESTED IN THE STORY OF ALEXANDER SHULGEN AND THE DRUG C SYNTHESIZED AND THE GROUP THAT HE BUILT UP TO TAKE THESE DRUGS AND TRY THEM AND ACTUALLY HAD SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP USING THESE DRUGS IN THEROPY WITH THEIR PATIENTS FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER M D  M BECAME ILLEGAL THERE'S A WONDERFUL BOOK CALLED PCALL THAT STANDS FOR P I K H A L PCALL IS THE TITLE OF THE BOOK WHICH SCHULGAN WROTE WHICH DESCRIBES HIS DISCOVERY OF M D  MA I CONFESS IT ALSO DESCRIBES THE SYNTHESIS OF M D  MA AND FOR THAT REASON WAS A BOOK THAT FOR A LONG TIME WAS NOT AVAILABLE BUT IS NOW AVAILABLE AGAIN IN AUDIBLE FORM AND IN A PRINTED FORM PCALL STANDS FOR PENALE ETHELA MEANS I HAVE KNOWN AND LOVED FINA LETHEL MEANS IS THE CATEGORY F DRUG FOR WHICH M D  MA BELONGS TO AND IT'S A LONG BOOK BUT A VERY INTERESTING ONE BOTH FROM THE PRERSPECTIVE OF UNDERSTANDING THE HISTORY OF M D  MA AND WHAT M D  MA IS AND THE EFFECTS THAT IT PRODUCES BUT ITS ALSO AN INTERESTING BOOK BECAUSE IT WILL TEACH YOU A LOT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE PHARMASEUITICAL INDUSTRY THE WAR ON DRUGS IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ILLEGAL DRUG EXPLORATION AND DRUGS FOR CLINICAL TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES SO RIGHT NOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE EMDIAMA IS CURRENTLY GRANTED BREAK THROUGH STATUS WHICH MEANS ITS NOW SOMETHING THAT SCIENTISTS AND CLINICIES CAN STUDY IF THEY HAVE AUTHORIZATION TO DO THAT IT IS AS I MENTION EARLIER STILL A SCEDULE ONE DRUG SO ITS ILLEGAL TO POSSESS UNLESS YOU ARE ONE OF THESE SCIENTIST WHO HAS BEEN GRANTED PERMISSION TO STUDY IT IN THE CLINICAL SETTING OR THE LABORATORY SETTING AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF EMDIA MA BECOMING LEGAL BUT AGAIN IT IS NOT YET LEGAL AND THIS IS SOMETHING I 'M GOING TO TOUCH BACK ON A FEW TIMES DURING TODAY'S EPISODE LATER FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL TOXICITY OF M DI A MA ITS ABILITY POTENTIALLY TO KILL NURONS AND THE NERONS IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO KILL ARDNERONS OF THE CERETONAN AND DOPOMINE TYPES TO THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WOULD NOT WANTLESS JUST RECALL THAT KILLING OFF OF OR DEATH OF DOPOMINERONS IS THE UNDERLYING BASIS FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE WHICH IS A MOVEMENT DISORDER WERE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTY GENERING SMOOTH MOVEMENTS AND IN VERY SEVERE FORM THEY CAN'T A MOVE AT ALL AND THE SORT F BECOME LOCKED IN TO SOME EXTENT AND IT ALSO HAS COGNIVE EFFECTS SO YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE DOPOMINERONS IN LOSS OF SERTONURGECNERONS IS KNOWN TO IMPACT MOOD NEGATIVELY A MOOD REGULATION NEGATIVELY ET CETERA THE STORY OF EMDIAMA IN ITS POTENTIAL NEUROTOXICITY COMES SLAM RIGHT UP AGAINST THIS ISSUE OF LEGALITY AND WHAT WILL GET INTO A LOBIT LATER IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SORT OF RACE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY CONSISTING OF TWO GROUPS ONE SET OF GROUPS TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE TOXICITY OF M DI MA SO THAT IT DOES NOT BECOME LEGAL AGAIN AND ANOTHER GROUP TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE UTILITY AND THE LACK OF TOXICITY IN M DIMA SO THAT IT DOES BECOME LEGAL AGAIN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTSTI SO EVEN THOUGH THE STORY PECALL RELATES TO EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE LARGELY THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES EIGHTIES AND NINETIES RIGHT NOW M D MA AND ITS TOXICITY ORNER LACK OF TOXICITY ITS LEGALITY OR LACK OF LEGALITY ARE REALLY KEY ISSUES SO AS YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS I'M GIVING YOU A REAL TIME BLOW BY BLOW OF WHAT LET UP TO WHERE WE ARE NOW BUT WE WILL ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE A DATA ON M D  MA MAY OR MAY NOT IMPACT THE POTENTIAL LEGAL STATUS OF M D MA O CASE OF WHAT IS M D MA M D  M IS THREE FOUR METHELINE DIOXY METHEMPHEDEMINE BUT UNLES YOU'RE CHEMIST IT'S NOT IN AMEAN MUCH TO YOU NOR SHOULD IT M D  MA HAS SOME VERY INTERESTING PROPERTIES THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT METHEMPHEDEMINE COMPONENT WHICH BECAUSE IT'S A METHEMPHEDEMINE AND ACTS LIKE OTHER MPHEDMINES WHAT IT DOES IS IT BLOCKS THE REUPTAKE OF DOPOMINE FROM NURONS AFTER DOPOMINE ITS RELEASED SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HEARD THE EPISODE THAT I DID ON DRUGS TO TREAT EHT T I DISCUSS THE BIOLOGY AND MECHANISMS OF DRUGS LIKE ADEROL AND VIVANTS WHICH BASICALLY ARE EITHER COMMINATIONS OF EMPHEDEMINES OR SINGLE TYPESOF AMPHEDEMINES THAT HAVE EITHER QUICK RELEASE OR A LONG RELEASE NOW M D  M BECAUSE IT HAS THIS METHEMPHEEMINE COMPONENT PREVENTS THE REUPTAKE OF DOPOMINE AND IN DOING SO CREATES NET INCREASES IN DOPOMINE SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T HAVE A BACKGROUND IN EUROMILOGYLIMING JUST BRIEFLY EXPLAIN I'LL MAKE THIS VERY SIMPLE NURONS ARE NERVE CELLS RELEASE CHEMICALS AT THEIR SITS OF COMMUNICATION WHICH ARE CALLED SINAPSES SYNAPSES ARE LITTLE GAPS BETWEEN NURONS AND WHAT HAPPINS IS THE NURONS SPIT OUT THESE LITTLE A SPHERICAL BALLS WHICH WE CALL VISICALS OR VESICALES DEPENNING ON WHERE IN THE WORLD YOU LIVE THEL EITHER BE CALLED VESICLES OR VECICLES AND THOSE LOLE VESCALS CONTAIN OURO TRANSMITTER OR WHAT'S TECHNIAELLY REFER TO IS A NUROMODULATOR DOPOMI IS A NUROMODULATOR CAN MODULATE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONSIT CAN EITHER INCREASE OR DECREASE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS NOW AT THE END OF THE NURON THA WHAT WE CALL THE AXONAL BUTON OKE AXON IS THE WIRE COMPONE OF THE NURON THAT CAN REACH TO ANOTHER SIDE IN THE BRAIN AND THEN RELEASE THE NURO TRANSMITTER NURMODULATOR THERE AT THOSE AXONAL BUTONS WHICH TE THE SITS OF RELEASE THE VESICLES LITERALLY FUSE WITH THE EDGE OF THE NURON AND ALL VOMIT THEIR NUROMODULATOR OUT INTO THE SCYNAPS AND THEN THE NUROMODULATOR THIS CASE DOPOMING WILL BIND A RECEPTORS ON THE POSTINAPTIC SIDE THAT MEANS TO ANOTHER NURON AND THEN DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH BINDS AND DEPENDING ON WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN THAT LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD OF NURONAL CONNECTIONS THE NURON WILL EITHER INCREASE ITS NERAL ACTIVITY AND ITSELF RELEASE NUROMODULATOR OR NUR TRANSMITTER SOME PLACE ALLS A SORT OF CHAIN REACTION OR ELSE IT WILL SUPPRESS ITS ACTIVITY AND THE FLOW OF COMMUNICATION FROM ONE NUR ON TO THE NEXT WILL BE STOPPED OKE SO EMDIAMA DOESN'T PREVENT THE RELEASE OF DOPOMING AT THE SCYNAPS IT DOES QUITE THE OPPOSITE IT ACTUALLY PREVENTS THE THE SUCKING UP OF THE DOPOMINE THAT'S BEEN RELEASED AND THAT DOES NOT BIND TO THE RECEPTORS SO BASILY WHAT IT DOES IS BLOCKS THESE THINGS CALLED DOPOMING TRANSPORTERS AND THE TRANSPORTERS ARE THE THINGS THAT SUCK BACK UP THE DOPOMING THAT'S BEEN RELEASE THAT HAS NOT BOUND TO RECEPTORS SO BECAUSE IT BLOCKS THAT SUCKING UP PROCESS THERE'S MORE DOPOMINE AROUND IN THE SCYNAPS TO HANG OUT AND THEN BIND TO RECEPTORS WONT SOME BECOME AVAILABLE T THE OTHER THING THAT THE METHEMPHEDEMIN COMPONENT OF EMDIAMA DOES JUST LIKE MATHEM PHEDEMINE IS THAT IT ACTUALLY GETS INTO WHAT WE CALL THE PRESINAPTING HER ON THE NURON THAT RELEASES THE DOPOMINE AND IT INTERFERES WITH THE REPACKAGING OF DOPOMINE INTO THOSE VESICLES NOW YOU MIGHT THINK O IT INTERFERES WITH THE REPACKAGING OF DOPOMININ O VESIGALS AND THEREFORE LESS WILL BE RELEASED BUT ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT A BUNCH OF DOPOMINE BUILDS UP IN THE PRESENAPTIC NURON SO THAT WHEN AN ELECTRICAL IMPULSE COMES DOWN THAT NURON AND DOPOMINI IS RELEASED A HUGE AMOUNT OF DOPAOMINE IS RELEASED AND THIS IS ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF METHEMPHEDEMINE END OF M DI AMA WHICH IS THAT IT LEADS TO ENORMOUS INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE RELEASED AND THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE THAT HANGS AROUND IN THE SENAPS AND THEREFORE IT INCREASES WHAT WE CALL DOOMANURGIC TONE OR DOPOMANURGIC DRIVE THAT'S JUST A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DESCRIBE INCREASES IN DOPOMI A SO THAT'S THE MAIN WAY THAT M D AME AND BY EXTENSION METHEMPHEDAMINE INCREASED DOPAMINE HOWEVER M DI AME IS NOT JUST METHEMPHEDAMINE ITS METHELING DIOXI METHEMPHEEMINE AND HAS ANOTHER INCREDIBLE PROPERTY WHICH IS THAT IT DOESN'T JUST LEAD TO HUGE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE IT ALSO LEADS TO HUGE INCREASES IN SERATONAN AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER NURONS THAT RELEASE SERATONAN AND THEY HAVE SERATONAN TRANSPORTERS WHICH ARE SOMETIMES CALLED SERTS SI AR T SES SERATONAN TRANSPORTERS AND THEY WORK VERY MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT DOPAOMINE TRANSPORTERS TO RIGHT THEY BASICALLY CONTROL THE SUCKING BACK UP OF SERATONAN THAT'S BEEN RELEASED INTO THE SENAPS AND THAT HAS NOT BOUND TO SERATONA RECEPTORS ON THE OTHER NURONS YET AND IN DOING SO ALLOW MORSIRTONAN TO HANG OUT AND HAVE ITS EFFECTS AS THOSE RECEPTORS BECOME AVAILABLE FOR SERATONAN TO BINE TO THEM THE OTHER THING EM DAME DOES IS IT ALSO GETS INTO THE PRESNAPTIC NURON TO IMPACT THE PACKAGING OF SERATONAN INTO SOMETHING CALLED THE VESICAL MONOMINE TRANSPORTER FOR SRATONAN AND IN DOING SO LEADS TO A BIG BUILD UP OF SERATONAN IN CRESONAPTIC TERMINALS AND THEN MASSIVE INCREASES IN SERATONAN RELEASE CA SO WHAT WE'VE GOT WITH EM DIAMA IS A REALLY INTERESTING COMPOUND UNLIKE METHEMPHEDAMINE OR OTHER EMPHEDAMINES SUCH AS ADERALL VIVE ANTS ET CETERA THAT CAUSE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE BY BLOCKING REUPTAKE AND INCREASING RELEASE OF DOPOM EMIAMA DOES THAT BUT IT ALSO DOES THE SAME THING FOR SERATONAN AND HERE'S A REALLY KEY POINT THE INCREASES IN SERATONAN THAT EMDIAMA CREATES OR AT LEAST THREE TIMES AND MAY BE AS MUCH AS EIGHT TIMES GREATER THEN THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE RELEASE THAT EMDIAMA CAUSES BUT WHEN YOU PUT THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER WHAT YOU BASELY HAVE AS A DRUG THAT CAUSES HUGE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE AND EVEN BIGGER INCREASES IN SERATONENT AND REMEMBER EARLIER WHEN I SAID THAT EMDIAMA IS A PURELY SYNTHETIC COMPOUND AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT DOES NOT EXIST IN ANY PLANTS OR FUNGUS OR ANYTHING ELSE IN NATURE WELL THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE OF HAVING BIG INCREASES IN DOPOMINE EN BIG INCREASES IN SERATONAN CAUSED BY THE SAME COMPOUND AND THAT COMMINATION OF BIG INCREASES IN DOPOMINE AND BIG INCREASES IN SERATONEN ARE WHAT LEAD TO THESE HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND YET WHAT SEEM TO BE POTENTIALLY CLINICALLY VERY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF HAVING PEOPLE FEEL A LOT OF MOOD ELEVATION AND A LOT OF STIMULATION FROM THE STIMULANT PROPERTIAS OF THE METHEMPHEDEMINE COMPONENT ESO THAT'S THE DOPOMINE EFFACT THE DOPOMANURGIC TONE GOES AWAY UP SO IT'S A STIMULANT PEOPLE FEEL REALLY ALERT THEY FEEL LIKE TALKING A LOT THEY FEEL VER ECITED THEY FEEL A LOT OF POSITIVE MOTIVATION ON THESE ARE CLASSIC EFFECTS OF DRUGS THAT PROMOTE THE RELEASE OF DOPOMINE INCLUDING EMPHEDAMINE COCANE ET CETERA BUT ORDINARILY THAT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD THING BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S THAN A CRASH IN THE DOPOMINE LEVELS AND THEN PEOPLE FEEL DEPRESSED THEY FEEL LETHARGIC THEY THEY DON'T FEEL GOOD AT ALL EMDAMA SEEMS TO CAUSE THESE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE AND ALL THE ACCOMPANYING EFFECTS I JUST DESCRIBED BUT BY ALSO CAUSING BIG INCREASES IN SERATONEN IT ACTIVATES NURL NETWORKS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FEELING MORE SOCIALLY CONNECTED IN FACT WE'LL TALK ABOUT DATA AND A LITTLE BIT WHERE PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR BRAINS IMAGED WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M D MA AD IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN M D MA LOOK AT FACES THAT ORDINARILY THEY WOULD RATE AS FEARFUL AND RATE THEM AS LESS FEARFUL THEY SEE FACES THAT ARE SMILING AND THEY RATE THOSE SMILING HAPPY FACES AS MORE POSITIVE THAN THEY WOULD OFF THE DRUG THE BIG INCREASES IN SERATONAN CREATE WHAT WE CALL A PROSOCIAL EFFACT AND THAT COMBINED WITH THE DOPAMENERGIC INCREASE IN MOOD AND THE STIMULATION EFFECT CREATES THIS THING THAN WE CALL AN EMPATHAGEN WHERE AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THE EMPATHY ISN'T JUST FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT'S ALSO FOR ONE'S SELF AND ONE'S OWN EXPERIENCES HAPPENING IN THE MOMENT AS WELL AS EMPATHY FOR EXPERIENCES FROM THE PAST WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE COULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTIST AN SO HOPEFULLY THE WAY I DESCRIBE THE BIOLOGY OF M DMA MAKE SOME SENSE IF YOU DIDN'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF THE DESCRIPTION I PROVIDED EXCEPT THE UNDERSTANDING THAT M D MA IS UNUSUAL IN THAT IT CAUSES BIG INCREASES IN DOPOMIN AND EVEN BIGGER INCREASES IN SERETONAN THAN YOU HAVE MORE IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE NOW ABOUT M  AMA THAN YOU NEED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE REST OF OUR DISCUSSION BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I DO WANT TO SEPARATE M D MA OUT FROM SOME OTHER COMPOUNDS WHICH ARE REFERRED TO AS SYCHODELICS AND I RECENTLY DID PODCAST EPISODE ALL ABOUT SYLICIBEN AND ITS THERE AREPEUTIC EXPLORATION AN ITS CHEMICAL BASIS ET CETERA YOU CAN FIND THAT LIKE ALL EPISODES AT HUBERMAN LABDOT COME I ALSO DID IN EPISODE WITH EXPERT GUEST DOCTOR ROBIN CARTART HARRIS WHOSE AT UNIVERSAY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO WHOSE PIONEERING LOT OF THE STUDIES ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF SILICEIBEN SYLICEIBEN ND ELEST ARE MAINLY GOING TO INCREASE SERATONEN ACTAVATION IN THE BRAIN IN FACT THEY VERY CLOSELY RESEMBLE SERATONE AN ITSELF AND THEY ACTIV ATE WHAT'S CALLED THE FIVE H T TO A OR SERATONE IN FIVE AH T GO STANDS FOR SERATONE AN THE FIVE H T TO A RECEPTOR TO CREATE VERY MYSTICAL TYPE EXPERIENCES THEY ARE CONSIDERED CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS IN OURE VERY INTROSPECTIVE AND AS I DESCRIBED IN THOSE EPISODES ARE BEING EXPLORED EXTENSIVELY NOW FOR THE TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSION A DIFFERENT COMPOUND THAT'S BEING USED FR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION IS KEDEMINE I WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT KEDEMINE KEDEMINE HIS ACTUALLY A N METHELDE ASPARTATE RECEPTOR BLOCKER ENM D A RECEPTOR BLOCKER THAT SHOULDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO MOST OF YOU BUT IT IS A DISSOCIATIVE AN AESTHETIC NOT UNLIKE P C P WHAT USE TO BE CALLED ANGEL DUST ON THE STREET KEDEMINE IS BEING USED AS A TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION IT IS CURRENTLY LEGAL SO UNLIKE SYLICIBON AN ELISTE WHICH ARE GRANTED BREAK THROUGH STATUS FOR THE STUDY OF DEPRESSION BUT ARE NOT YET LEGAL THEY ARE STILL ILLEGAL AND OF COURSE AS I MENTION EARLY M D MA HAS BREAK THROUGH STATUS BUT IS STILL ILLEGAL KEDEMINE IS BEING USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AN IT DOES SO AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS A DESOCIAVE AND AESTHETIC BY CREATING A SENSE OF DISSOCIATION FROM EMOTIONS KA NOW I RAISE THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN SYLICIBON ANELISTE WHICH ARE MYSTICAL IN THEIR EFFECTS KEDEMINE WHICH IS DISSOCIATIVE IN ITS EFFECTS WITH M D MA WHICH IS AN IMPATHAGEN OR SOMETIMES CALLED AN ENACTOGEN BUT AS AN EMPATHAGEN OR ENACTOGEN IT'S CREATING MORE AFFILIATION IT'S AFFILIATIVE KA SO IT'S A VERY DISTINCT COMPOUND AND I THIS IS IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD PSYCHODELIC A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO LUMP TOGETHER ELEST SYLICIBAN AND M D  MA IF YOU TALK TO RESEARCHERS IN THESE AREAS THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT M DMA REALLY ISN'T THAT MUCH OF A PSYCHODELIC IT'S AN EMPATHAGEN WITH STIMULANT PROPERTIES AND ELSE HAS TE SERATONERGIC COMPONENT THAT MAKES IT AN EMPATHAGEN OR AN ENACTOGEN SO M D M A IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER PSYCHODELICS AND MY HUNCH IS THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE WILL STOP TALKING ABOUT M D MA AS A PSYCHODELIC BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TEND TO PRODUCE VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS OR AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS OF THE SORT THAT CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS D AND IN GENERAL IT IS MORE EV A MOOD IMPACTING DRUG THAN IT IS MYSTICAL ICASE IT WILL GET INTO SOME OF THE BRAIN NETWORKS IN WHICH ONES ARE ACTAVATED WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M D M BUT I DO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SEGMENT OUT M D M A FROM THE OTHER SO CALL CLASSIC PSYCHODELICS AND ALSO PSYGMENTED OUT FROM KEDEMY THANKS OS SOME REALLY TERRIFIC STUDIES BOTH IN ANIMAL MODELS AND IN HUMANS WE NOW UNDERSTAND A LOT OF WHAT MAKES M D MA PRODUCE THESE INCREDIBLY UNIQUE EFFECTS AND WE SAY UNIQUE I MEAN UNIQUE FROM DRUGS LIKE SYLISIBEN AND ELES T AND KEDEMINE AND FROM METHEMPHEDEMINE FOR THAT MATTER AND IT'S REALLY THE COMMINATION OF BIG INCREASES IN DOPEMINE AND EVEN BIGGER INCREASES IN CERETONAN THAT CREATE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE MORE ENERGY AND YET DESPITE HAVING MORE ENERGY THEY DON'T FEEL IRRITATED THEY FEEL A LOT OF PLEASURE THEY SEEM TO WANT TO BE IN THE STATE OF HAVING A LOT OF ENERGY THIS WILL BECOME IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT ANXIETY AND THE ANXIETY SYMPTOMS OF PT S T IT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE BIG INCREASES IN CERETONAN PRODUCES A SENSE OF EMOTIONAL WARMTH TOWARDS OTHERS AND TOWARDS ONESELF THAT'S TH IN PATHAGIN COMPONENT AND FOR REASONS THAT WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS TO INCREASE TRUST AND THE INCREASES IN TRUST TURN OUT TO BE VITAL BECAUSE A WE WILL ALSO LEARN LATER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CLINICAL TRIALS ECXPLORING M D MA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT S T THE MAJOR EFFECT OF M D MA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT S T IS NOT TO CURE PT S T BUT RATHER TO MAKE THE THERAPY THE TALK THERAPY FOR PT S T MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT IN FACT SO IMPORTANT I AM GOING TO REPEAT IT AT LEAST THREE TIMES DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE M DIA MA TAKEN ON ITS OWN DOES NOT CURE PTIST MDIA MA CAN AUGMENT OR BOOST THE EFFECTS OF TALCTHERAPI FOR PTIST AND IT DOES THAT THROUGH THE ENGAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC NERAL CIRCUITS BUT BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE NERAL CIRCUITS ARE ONE EMPHASIZE THAT THE INCREASES IN CERATONEAN THE EMDIA MA PRODUCES SEEM TO ACT ON DIFFERENT RECEPTORS THEN THE BIG INCREASES IN CERATONE IN THE ELEST AND SCILICIBON PRODUCE IF YOU LISTEN TO THE EPISODE THAT I DID ON SYLICIVON WE HAVEN'T DONE YET ONE ON ELIST BUT THE MECHANISMS ARE VERY SIMILAR FOR SILICIVON AN ELIST WHEREBY SYLICIBON AN ELIST VERY CLOSELY MIMIC THE MOLECULE CERATONE IN ITSELF BUT SEEM TO HAVE A MORE SELECTIVE ACTIVATION OF JUST THE SO CALLED CERATONAN TO A RECEPTOR ABBREVIATED FIVE H T TO A AND THAT LEADS TO MORE INTERCONNECTIVENESS BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS MORE CONSIDERATION OF NEW POSSIBILITIES ABOUT EVENTS FROM THE PASS PRESENT IN FUTURE AND ALSO THE OPENING OF SO CALLED NEURL PLASTICITY OF REWIRING OF NERL CONNECTIONS THAT PERSIST LONG AFTER THE SILICIVON OR ELIST EFFECTS HAVE WORN OFF NO MDI MA CAN ACTIVATE THE CRATONAN TO A RECEPTOR BUT IT SEEMS THAT IT LARGELY ACTIVATES THE CERATONAN ONE B RECEPTOR W WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ACTIVATION OF THE CRATONE AN ONE B RECEPTOR SEEMS TO BE WHAT GIVES M DA MA ITS VERY STRONG IMPACT ON THE NEURAL CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN THAT RELATE TO TRUST AND TO SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT NOT JUST THE WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE SOCIALLY AND TO CONFIDE IN A THERAPIST OR ANOTHER PERSON BUT THE INTENSE DESIRE TO DO SO AND WHEN I SAY INTENSE DESIRE THAT TAKES US BACK TO THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM REMEMBER DOPOMINE EVEN THOUGH WHEN INCREASED IN THE BRAIN CAN INCREASE OUR MOOD IT IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR INCREASING OUR SENSE OF MOTIVATION AND DESIRE FOR SOMETHING AND TO DO SOMETHING SO THE INCREASE IN DOPOMINE THAT'S CREATED BY MDIAMA SEEMS TO MAKE PEOPLE WHAT I CALL FORWARD CENTERA MASS YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING VERY MOTIV ATED TO DO SOMETHING AND THE INCREASES IN CERATONE AN ACTING ON THE CERETONE IN ONE BE RECEPTOR SEEMS TO BE WHAT CREATES THIS DESIRE TO BOND OR CREATE TRUST OR TO HAVE A DISCUSSION OF REAL THINGS BOTH THINGS THAT ARE POSITIVE BUT ALSO TO EXPLORE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT AND THIS I REALIZE IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A MIND BEND FOR PEOPLE TO TO UNDERSTAND BUT ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS THAT QUALITY M DIAMA THERAPY CONSISTS OF IS NOT JUST HAVING A VERY GOOD REPOR IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE THERAPIS THAT'S GUIDING THE PITIESTI TREATMENT BUT ALSO REPOR AND A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH ONES SELF AND I THINK THAT MOST OF US CAN RELATE TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCES SOME OF WHICH ARE HARD SOME OF WHICH ARE GREAT AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN TRAMA IS I BELIEVE BEST DEFINE BY THE WORDS THAT A FORMER GUEST ON THIS PODCASS WHOIS A WORLD EXPERT AN TRAMA PALCANTI EXPLAINED AS TRAMA IS AN EVENT THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE WAY THAT OUR BRAIN WORKS FOR THE WORSE CASO NOT EVERY BAD EVENT OF OUR PAST IS TRMA BUT EVENTS THAT CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE THINK OUR EMOTIONAL TONE OR OUR BEHAVIOR IN WAYS GOING FORWARD THAT ARE NOT ADAPTEVE FOR US THEY DON'T SERVE US WELL EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY DISTRACTING OR BECAUSE  THEY CREATE ANXXIETY OR BECAUSE THEY DISTRUPT SLEEP OR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT AR MALADAPTIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT'S WHAT REALLY DEFINES TRAMA AND WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M DIAMA BECAUSE OF THOSE PARALLEL INCREASES IN DOPOMIN N CERATONAN PEOPLE SEEM FAR MORE WILLING TO BOTH TRUST THE THERAPUS THAT THEIR TALKING ABOUT THAT TRAMA WITH BUT ALSO TO TRUST THEIR OWN ABILITY TO COT AN QUOTE GO INTERNAL AND THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGING THING OR THINGS CAUSE OFTENTIMES TRAMA CAN CONSIST OF MANY EVENTS NOT JUST ONE EVENT AND THE THOUGHT PATTERNS AROUND THAT IN THE CONTEXT AROUND THAT AND THEREIN TO BE ABLE TO EXPLORE NEW POSSIBILITIES TO ESSENTIALLY REWIRE THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THAT TRAMA I PROMISE THAT A LIBIT LATER WILL TALK ABOUT THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF EMD MA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT ST BUT NOW ID LIKE TO SHIFT OFF OF THE CHEMICAL CHANGES THAT EMDIA MAY PRODUCES AND SOME OF THE SUBJECTIVE CHANGES THESE INCREASES IN TRUST AND PLEASURE AND ENERGY AND EMOTIONAL WARMTH TO SOME OF THE BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT ARE ACTIVATED EN MODIFIED BY M D MA USE AND THEN WE WILL EXPLORE THE TOXICITY ISSUE AND THEN WE WILL EXPLORE THE CLINICAL STUDIES OF WHICH I CAN PROMISE YOU ARE EXTREMELY EXCITING BUT UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND THE NERAL CIRCUIT PHENOMENA AND OF COURSE UNTIL WE CONSIDER THE NEURATOXICITY ISSUES I DON'T THINK THOSE CLINICAL FINDINGS CAN BE APPRECIATED IN THEIR FULL VALUE BUT NOW ID LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT EMD AMA REALLY DOES IN THE BRAIN BOTH IN THE SHORT TERN WHILE SOME ONE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DRUG AND IN THE LONG TERM WHAT SORTS OF NEURO PLASTIC OR REWIRING CHANGES DOES EM MA PRODUCE AND HOW CAN THOSE BE BENEFICIAL OR PERHAPS NOT BENEFICIAL I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SO ME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEASON I STARTY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ATS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE IMMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBOTICS AN NATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ITH LETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VIEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTES GRIGHT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN SDOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S ATHLETI GREENSDOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR'S SUPPLY A VITEMIN D THREE K TO SO IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EMDIAMA DOES TO THE HUMAN BRAIN WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALLY DEFINE THE SORTS OF EXPERIMENTS THAT ONE COULD DO SO FOR INSTANCE YOU COULD TAKE A PERSON WHOSE NEVER INGESTED M D M A AND PUT THEM INTO AN EFEMORI MACHINE WHICH IS FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESIDENCE IMAGING PUT THEM INTO EFEMORI MACHINE AND JUST HAVE THEM SIT THERE WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED WHAT WE CALL RESTING FUNCTIONAL CONICTIVITY WHERE RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONICTIVITY AND SIMPLY LOOK AT HOW INTERCONNECTED CERTAIN BRAIN AREAS ARE WHICH BRAINAIRY IS OR ACTIVE WHICH BRAINAR IS OUR LESS ACTIVE AT REST THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO NOT JUST TO PROVIDE A BASE LINE FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE DRUG MD MA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY DO BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES WHAT'S CALLED THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK OR D M N IS THE NET WORK THAT IS ACTIVE IN OUR BRAINS WHEN WE AREN'T REALLY ATTENDING TO ANYTHING SPECIFIC OUTSIDE US AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING SPECIFIC OR ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING SPECIFIC ITASHLLY RELATES OUR SENSE OF IMAGINATION AND DAY DREAMING IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH OURSELF REFERENCING YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES THIS MAY COME AS NO SURPRISE BUT YOURE JUST SITTING THERE ON THE BUS SIR YOU KNOW ROUND THE DINNER TABLE AND YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON IT ENLARGE PART YOUR BRAIN IS IN THIS DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF CASO WE CAN GET A SENSE OF W T THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK ACTIVATION IS WE CAN GET A SENSE OF WHICH BRAIN AREAS ARE MORE OR LESS ACTIVE SIMPLY BY PUTTING SOMEBODY INTO AN PHEMARI MACHINE THEN OF COURSE YOU COULD GIVE SOMEBODY M D  MA WHILE THEY ARE IN THE PHIMARI MACHINE AND SEE HOW THE ACTIVATION OF DIFEREN RAIN NETWORKS CHANGES AND THEN OF COURSE YOU COULD ANALYZE HOW THE DEFAULT MO NETWORKS ANOTHER BRAIN NET WORKS CHANGE IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AND EVEN YEARS AFTER THE DRUG HAS WORN OFF SO CALL NEURO PLASTICITY EFFECTS WHAT CHANGED IN A PERMANENT OR PERVASIVE WAY IS THAT'S TO ONE BASIC PARADIME FOR EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS LIKE MD MA ON THE BRAIN THE OTHER WAY THAT YOU CAN EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF M D AMA ON THE BRAIN IS TO ASK PEOPLE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION HEY WHO OUT THERE HAS TAKEN M D  MA HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU TAKEN IT AND COME ON INTO THE LABORATORY AND WE WILL IMAG YOUR BRAIN AND COMPARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FOR INSTANCE TAKEN M D MA ZERO TIMES TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN M D MA ONE TIME OR FIVE TIMES OR BELIEVE ARE NOT THEIRE SOME STUDIE SITTING RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME ON MY DESK OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN M D MA MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TIMES AND ASK THE SAME SOURTS OF QUESTIONS WHICH BRAIN AREAS ARE MORE OR LESS ACTIVE THOSE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE AS WELL AND OF COURSE ONE CAN DO STUDIES WHERE YOU GIVE PEOPLE DIFFERENT DOSAGES OF M D MA AS WELL AS GIVING PEOPLE M D MA AND THEN GIVING THEM SPECIFIC STIMULE MEANING NOT JUST ASKING THEM TO SIT THERE IN THE PHEMORIZE GANTER WITH EYES CLOSED LOOKING AT THE RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONUCTIVITY BUT ALSO HOW THE BRAIN RESPONDS TO THE PRESENTATION OF HAPPY FACES ARE SAD FACES OR IMAGES OF ONE SELL OR EVEN IMAGES THAT RECALL MEMORIES OF TRAMATIC EVENTS AND SO ON SO FORTUNATELY ALL OF THOSE SORTS OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE IN HUMANS AND THERE ARE ALSO A LARGE NMBER OF STUDIES IN ANIMAL MODELS EXPLORING HOW THE SOCIAL ACTIVITY OF LABORATORY MICE CHANGES WHEN THEY ARE UNDER THE EFFECTS OF M D MA OR EVEN STUDIES BELIEVE IT ARE NOT ON THE EFFECTS OF MDIAMA IN SEPHLOPOD SEPHLOPODS INCLUDE OCTYPUSIS AS WELL AS CUDDLEFISH AND OTHER AQUATIC ANIMALS THAT ARE KNOWN FOR HAVING COMPLEX BEHAVIOR SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE SEPHLOPODS ARE EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT ON THE O THE OBSESSION WITH SEPHLOPODS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY INTRIGUES ME I ASHEEST HAVE CUTTLEFISH IN MY LABORATORY WE DO NOT PUT THEM ON M D MA BUT THERE IS A STUDY THAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL CURRENT BIOLOGY THE SELPRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THIS IS FROM GULDOLEN'S LABORATORY AT JOHNSHOPKINS SCHUOLLOF MEDICINE SHOWING THAT A FEW GIVE OCTYPUSIS M DIAMA THEY LIKE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH OTHER OCTYPUSES THAN THEY DO IF THEY ARE NOT ON M D MA AND THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE CONNEVA AM AND OF A PLAYFUL EXPERIMENT JUST DONE A IN ORDER TO ENTERTAIN ONE SELF AND THE OCTYPUSIS PERHAPS BUT ACTUALLY IN THAT STUDY THEY IDENTIFIED THE SERATONAN TRANSPORTER IN OCTYPUSES AND SHOW THAT IT HAS A LOT OF HOMOLOGY SIMILARITY TO HUMAN CERATONAN TRANSPORTER RECEPTORS AND SO WHAT THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO AS THE FACT THAT THE PRO SOCIAL EFFECTS OF M DAMA THAT ARE OBSERVED IN MICE AND INHUMANS AND IN OCTYPUSES ALL HAVE A COMMON BASIS WHICH IS THE ACTIVATION OF MORE CERATONIN RELEASE IN PARTICULAR BRAIN NETWORKS OCASE OF THAT INTERESTING STUDY ON OCTYPUS IS ASIDE I THINK WHAT MOST OF US ARE INTERESTED IN IS HOW EMDIAMA IMPACTS THE BRAIN AND SO IAM GOING TO SPELL OUT THE THREE MAJOR WAYS IN WHICH MDIAMA CHANGES THE ACTIVATION OF THE BRAIN IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM AND HERE ON POOLING ACROSS NUMBER F DIFFERENT STUDIES BUT ONE OF THE KEYSETS OF STUDIES IN THE SARIA COMES FROM THE WHAT I CONSIDER VERY BEAUTIFUL WORK OF HARRIET DE WIT HARRIET DE WIT RUNS THE HUMAN BEHAVIORAL PHARMOCOLOGY LABORATORY IN THE DEPARTMENTOF PSYCHIOTRY BEHAVIORAL NOURAL SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSY OF CHICAGO AN HER LABORATORY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF GIVING PEOPLE CERTAIN DRUGS IN VERY SPECIFIC DOSAGES AND THEN MEASURING THEIR EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMAGING INCLUDING FHAMORI AND ONE PARTICULAR STUDY THAT ALL HIGH LIGHT IS ENTITLED EFFECTS OF EM DIAMA ON SOCIABILITY AND NERAL RESPONSES TO SOCIAL THREAT AND SOCIAL REWARD SO WHAT THE STUDY LOOKED AT IS HOW EMDIAMA IMPACTS PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF OTHERS EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS ON THEIR FACE WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE ON EM DIAMA THEIR RESPONSE TO THREATENING FACES OR OTHER THREATENING STIMULAE IS REDUCED AND IT'S REDUCED IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY WHICH IS REDUCTIONS IN ACTIVITY OF THE EMIGDULA THE EMIGDULA IS A STRUCTURE THAT SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH IT IS KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN THE THREAT DETECTION SYSTEMS OR NETWORKS OF THE BRAIN IT IS SOMETIMES CALLD THE FEURE AREA OF THE BRAIN ALTHOUGH I WANT A CAUTION PEOPLE AGAINST ASSIGNING ANY ONE PARTICULAR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE TO ANY ONE PARTICULAR BRAINARA THEY MIGDULA AS ACTUALLY A COMPLEX AS AS UL CALL THE EMIGDULOID COMPLEX AND HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBAREAS AND ITS INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THINGS BESIDES FEAR AND THREAT DETECTION NONE THE LESS WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EM DY MA YOU SHOW THEM A FACE THAT IS GRIMACING OR WOULD OTHERWISE BE RATED AS QUITE THREATENING THEY TEND TE RATE AS LESS THREATENING IN ADDITION THEY TEND TO RESPOND TO HAPPY FACES OR EVEN SLIGHTLY HAPPY FACES AS MORE KIND OR MORE GENEROUS OR HAPPIER THAN THEY WOULD WHEN THEY ARE NOT ON EM DY MA AGAIN THE FACES THAT ARE BEING SHOWN ARE NOT OF PEOPLE ON EM DAMA THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DID HERE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS PEOPLE ARE BEING GIVEN EM DIAMA AND THEN THEY ARE RADING IN A SUBJECTIVE WAY THE FRIENDLINESS OR THE LEVEL OF THREAT THAT THEY DETECT IN THESE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS IN OF COURSE THEY HAVE EXTREMES OF FRIENDLY AND THREATENING BUT THEN THEY ALSO GRADE THEM RIGHT THEY TITRATE THEM SO THAT THEY ALSO HAVE MILDLY THREATENING AND MILDLY A HAPPY FACES ET CETERA SO EVERYTHING FROM A GRIN TO A SMIRK TO A GIANT SMILE EVERYTHING FROM A FROM A SORT OF A YOU KNOW SOMEBODY LOOKING A LIT BIT OF SCANTS AT SOMEBODY TO REALLY YOU KNOW WIDE EYED IN LOOKING ANGRY LIKE THEIR UNOGAN ATTACKYOU IN AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO WHAT'S DISCOVERED IN THE STUDY IS THAT M D  MA HAS A BY DIRECTIONAL EFFECT ON OUR PERCEPTION OF OTHERS EMOTIONS MAKING PEOPLE MORE LIKELY TO RATE SOMETHING AS POSITIVE IF IT'S INITIALLY POSITIVE OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT POSIVE AND LESS LIKELY TO RATE A THREATENING FACE AS MORE THREATENING NOW ONE THING I HAVE NOT MENTIONED THUS FAR ARE THE DOSAGES OF M D  MA USED IN THIS AND ANOTHER STUDIES AND FORTUNATELY DESPITE THE STUDIES THAT WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT USING A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE DIFFERENT AGES DIFFERENT SEXES O MALE ND FEMALE LOCATE IN DIFFENT PARTS OF THE WORLD EVEN SOME WITH PTSTS SOMETHING NOT WITH PT ST ET CETERA THERE'S BEEN FAIRLY TIGHT DOSAGE CONTROL OF M D  M IN THESE STUDIES IT'S NOT PERFECTLY MATCH FROM STUDY TO STUDY BUT IT'S PRETTY DARN CLOSE WHICH MAKES INTERPRETING RESULTS ACROSS STUDIES A LOT EASIER FOR ME AND THEREFOR FOR YOU THE TYPICAL DOSAGES OF M D MA USED IN THESE NOR IMAGING STUDIES AND IN THE CLINICAL STUDIES OF PT ST THAT WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LATER RANGE ANYWHERE FROM POINT SEVEN FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILIGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT TO ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILIGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT SO FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME I WEIGH TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS THAT'S A UNDRED MILIGRAMS ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS POR KILIGRAM A BODYWEIGHT WOULD THEREFORE BE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILIGRAMS IN A SINGLE DOSE K A DOSAGE OF ONE MILIGRAM PER KILIGRAM A BODYWEIGHT WOULD MEAN A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS FOR MY HUNDRED KILIGRAMS OCATE SOMEBODY LIGHTER THAN A HUNDRED KILIGRAMS WOULD OBVIOUSLY TAKE LESS M D  MA IN ONE OF THESE STUDIES BUT IN GENERAL THE RANGE OF M D MA THAT'S BEEN EXPLORED IS POINT SEVEN FIVE TO ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT THE EXCEPTION BEING IN THE CLINICAL STUDIES THAT WILL TALK ABOUT A LITBIT LATER THERE'S A TENDENCY TO EXPLORE B OTH AN INITIAL DOSE OF ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILIGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT SO AGAIN FOR A HUNDRED KILIGRAM PERSON THER B A HNDRED FIFTY MILIGRAMS OR SO AND THEN A SO CALLED BOOSTER OF HALF THAT AMOUNT ABOUT NINETY MINUTES TO TWO AND A HALF HOURS INTO THE SESSION SO ANOTHER SEMENY FIVE MILIGRAMS LATER AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THERE IS NOT ALWAYS THE INCLUSION OF THE SO CALLED BOOSTER AND IN SOME CASES LOWER DOSES OF M D MA SUCH AS THE POINT EVAN FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILIGRAM DOSAGES ARE USED WHY AM I GETTING SO INTO THE DETAILS OF DOSAGES WELL IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOXICITY OF M D M WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT DOSAGES BECAUSE LIKE ANY DRUG THE TOXICITY OF M D MA DOES SCALE WITH THE DOSAGE THATSUPPLIED NOT JUST THE FREQUENCY OF M D  MA USE WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW SOME ONE HAS TAKEN M D  MA ONE TIME OR FOUR TIMES OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES WE HEAR ABOUT FREQUENCY OF USE BUT RARELY DO WE HEAR ABOUT THE SPECIFIC DOSAGES THAT ARE TAKEN IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR SESSION SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OR THE BRAIN NETWORKS THAT ARE ACTIVATED WHEN PEOPLE TAKE M D MA IN GENERAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOSAGEIS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN POINT SEVEN FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILIGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT AND ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILIGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT ALTHOUGH TYPICALLY YOU ARE GOING TO SEE STUDIES BOTH CLINICAL AND MORE RESEARCH EXPLORATIVE USING ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS OF M D MA PER KILIGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF M D  MA ENGAGING THE RESPONSES OF PEOPLES FASES BUT I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THE BRAIN AREAS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE EXCEPT FOR THE REDUCTION IN A MIGDOLA ACTIVITY NOW ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES OF P T ST SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE IS A HEIGHTENED CONACTIVITY BETWEEN THE MIGDULA AND A BRAIN AREA CALLED THE INSULA THE INSULA IS A BRAIN AREA THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR SOMETHING THAT'SCALLED INTERROCEPTION IN TERRECEPTION IS ONE'S PERCEPTION OF OUR FEELINGS BOTH PURE SENSATIONS BUT ALSO OUR EMOTIONAL STATES AND OUR FEELINGS A WELL BEING OR LACK OF WELL BEING FOR EVERYTHING FROM OUR SKIN INWARD CISO THAT'S INTERRECEPTION YOU ACTUALLY CAN NTERROCEPT NOW EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS INTERECEPTING A LITTLE BIT YOU CAN INTERACEPT NOW TO A GREAT DEGREE IF YOU WERE TO FOR INSTANCE CLOSE YOUR EYES OR SIMPLY FOCUS ON THE CONTACT POINTS BETWEEN YOUR BODY AND ANY SURFACE THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE CONTACTING SO MAY BE THE BACKS OF YOUR LEGS AGAINST A CHAIR OR YOUR FEET AGAINST THE FLOOR OR THE BOTTOMS OF YOUR SHOES OR SANDALS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS CONSTANTLY SENSING THOSE CONTACT POINTS BUT NORMALLY THERE NOT UNDER YOUR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS UNLESS YOU DIRECT YOUR INTERECEPTIVE CAPACITY TO THEM WHICH HAS JUST FANCY NERVES SPEAK FOR SAYING YOU NORMALLY DON'T NOTICE WHAT'S GOING ON FROM YOUR SKIN INWARD UNLESS YOU FOCUS ON IT THAT FOCUS IS INTERRECEPTION IT CAN BE ABOUT THE FULLNESS OF YUR GOT IT CAN BE ABOUT HOW HAPPY OR SAD YOU ARE IT CAN BE ABOUT HOW TIRED OR ALERT YOU HAPPEN TO FEEL BUT THAT'S IN TERACEPTION AND IT IS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM EXTERRECEPTION WHICH IS YOUR ABILITY AND TENDENCY TO FOCUS ON THINGS BEYOND THE CONFINES OF YOUR SKIN SO THIS COULD BE VISUAL ATTENTION AUDITORY ATTENTION IT COULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO ON EVENTS LIKE BIRDS FLYING BY WHETHER NOT YOUR UBER IS SHOWING UP THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND WE ARE ALWAYS IN A BALANCE A PUSHPULL OF INTERRECEPTION AND EXTERECEPTION THE INSULA IS A BRAIN AREA THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR INTERRECEPTION SO MUCH SO THAT IT HAS A MAP OF THE COMPLETE BODY SURFACE INCLUDING OUR INTERNAL ORGANS IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU PUT SOMEBODY INTO AN EFEMORI MACHINE OR YOU WERE TO RECORD FROM THE INSULA WITH ELECTRODESAS HAS BEEN DONE IN HUMANS MANY TIMES NOW DURING THE COURSE OF NEROU SURGERY FOR OTHER PURPOSES WHAT YOUOULD FIND IS THAT IF YOU STIMULATE NORONS IN ONE END OF THE INSULA THE PERSONALL SAO YOU KNOW I I FEEL SOMETHING GOING ON IN MY GO T AND ON MY LEFT SIDE AND THEN AS YOU WERE TO MARCH THAT STIMULATION ACROSS THE INSULA YOU WOULD FIND THAT THEY WOULD NOW BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THEIR LEGS OR JUST TO ONE LEG OR TO THEIR WHOLE BODY OR A TO THE SENSATIONS IN THEIR FACE OR THEIR HEADS SO THERE'S A SYSTEMATIC MAP OF INTERROCEPTION IN THE INSULA AND THERE ARE DIRECT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE EMIGDULA AND THE INSULA AND THE IMIGDULA DESPITE GETTING THIS REPUTATION IS JUST BEING A FEER CENTER OR THREAT DETECTION CENTER IS ASHALY PART OF A MUCH LARGER SET OF NETWORKS THAT INCLUDE INPUTS FROM THE HIPPOCAMPUS NARRY OF THE BRAIN THAT'S INVOLVED IN MEMORY FORMATION AND STORAGE AND WHAT IS OBSERVED IS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE PT ST TEND TO HAVE GREATER OR RATHER STRONGER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE EMIGDULA AND THE INSULA THEN IS NORMALLY OBSERVED IN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE PT ST SO THERE SEEMS TO BE HEIGHTENED INPUT FROM THE THREAT DETECTION CENTERS OF THE BRAIN TO THIS AREA OF THE BRAIN THE INSULA THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR SENSE OF INTERRACEPTION WHICH PROVIDES A LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR WHY PEOPLE WITH PT ST OFTEN WILL FEEL THE MEMORY OR SENSE THE DISCOMFORT OR JUST FEEL AGITATION OR EVEN OTHER TYPES OF BODILY SENSATIONS LIKE BACK PAIN OR JUST PERHAPS JUST A A SENSE WITHIN THEIR BODY THAT'S MORE GENERALIZE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE PAIN DOEST EVEN HAVE TO BE NEGATIVE BUT THAT'S A SOCIATED WITH THE NEGATIVE MEMORY OF SOME TRAMATIC EVENT OR SERIES OF EVENTS CSO THIS IS OF REALLY INTERESTING BRAINNETWORK THAT I SHOULD MENTION EXISTS IN EVERYBODY BUT THAT IN PEOPLE WITH PT ST SEEMS TO HAVE HEIGHTENED CONICTIVITY IN THOSE BRAIN NETWORKS CAN BE REVEALED BY PUTTING PEOPL WITH P T ST INTO FUNCTIONAL IMAGING MACHINES GETTING THEM TO RECALL A TRAMATIC EVENTS OR EVEN LOOKING AT THE RESTING STATE OF CONICTIVITY BETWEEN THE EMIGDUL AND THE INSULA SO THOSE EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE AND WHAT'S ALSO BEEN DONE IS TO GIVE PEOPLE ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILEGRAM OF M D MA AND TO LOOK AT THE CONIC TIVITY BETWEEN THE EMIGDULA AND THE INSULA AND BETWEEN THE HIPPOCAMPUS THE EMIGDULA AND THE INSULA AND SO WHAT'S OBSERVED OVER TIME IN PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN M DI MA AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND AND HAVE DONE THERAPY FOR PT ST BOTH BEFORE JURING AND AFTER THE DRUG THEREIS A WEAKENING OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE EMIGDULA AND THE INSULA AND THAT SCALES VERY DIRECTLY WITH THE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS FROM PT ST THIS IS REALLY EXCITING BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO SEE A BRAINNET WORK AT ACTIVATED OR INACTIVATED OR YOU SAOCA IN ONE PERSON A CERTAIN CONNECTION BETWEEN THREAT CENTRS AND THE TERECEPTIVE CENTERS OF THE BRAIN WAS LET'S A ARBITRARY UNITS TH SAY WAS  LEVEL EIGHT OUT OF TEN FOR THAT PERSON ARETHESE THINGS ARE NORMALIZED FOR A PARTICULAR PERSON AND THEN AFTER TAKING MD MA AND DOING PT ST THERAPY IT WAS FIVE OUT OF TEN OR FOR OUT OF TEN THAT'S A GOOD EXPERIMENT BUT WHAT'S FAR MORE POWERFUL IS TO OBSERVE THAT IN THAT PATIENT OR THAT PERSON AND THEN TO SEE A CHANGE THAT'S PERHAPS LESS DRAMATIC SO A SHIFT FROM EIGHT OUT OF TEN TO SEVEN OUT OF TEN IN ANOTHER PERSON AND TO SEE LESS SHIFT IN BRAIN CONECTIVITY IN THES SAME NETWORK AND THEN PERHAPS IN THE PERSON N THAT WHEN FROM FULL BLOWN PT ST TO FULL REMISSION OF PT ST SOMETHING THAT BELIEVED OR NOT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN SINGLE SESSIONS WITH EM D MA IF THAT PERSON DEMONSTRATES AND EVEN GREATER REDUCTION IN THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE AMIGDULA AND THE INSULA WELL THEN THAT GIVES EVEN MORE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE IMIGDULA AND THE INSULA IS ACTUALLY PERHAPS CAUSILY RELATED TO THE REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS OF PT ST OR EVEN IF IT'S JUST CORRELATED WITH REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS OF PT ST THE FACT THAT THE DEGREE OF REDUCTION OF CONNECTION OF THIS CIRCUIT SCALES WITH THE REDUCTION IN CLINICALLY RELEVANT SYMPTOMS THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL FINDING BECAUSE IT MOVES THINGS AWAY FROM PURE CORRELATI TION AOUGH THIS BRAIN AREAS ACTIVE OR LESS ACTIVE OVER TIME AND THE ON THIS PERSON HAS MORE OR FEWER SYMPTOMS OF PTIEST TO SOMETHING THAT STARTS TO LOOK LIKE A MECHANISTIC AND LOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING PTST AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF EMD A MA AND FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW CHANGES IN THE BRAIN UNDER LIE RELIEF FROM PTSTI OCHESODE AGAIN EVEN IF YOU JUST COULD GRASP THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE A BRAIN AREA THE EMIDULA THAT'S INVOLVED IN THREAT DETECTION AND IT PROVIDES IN PUTS TO ANOTHER BRAIN ARA CALL THE INSULA WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THIS THING CALLED INTERRECEPTION AND THAT REDUCTIONS IN THOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE EMIGULA AND THE INSULA SCALE WITH OR CORRELATE WITH REDUCTIONS IN PTIESTI SYMPTOMS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PEOPLE TAKING EM D ME SO IF YOU HAVE THAT UNDER YOUR MENTAL BELT I PROMISE YOU YOU UNDERSTAND FAR MORE ABOUT HOW EMD MA IMPACTS THE BRAIN IN THE SHORTEN LONG TERM THAN NINEY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE HOWEVER IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT YOU UNDERSTAND A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT EMDI AMA DOES TO THE BRAIN AS WELL AS WHAT IT DOESN'T DUE TO THE BRIN FIRST OF ALL CLASSIC SYCHODELICS LIKE SYLICIVAN AN ELIST AS I MENTION EARLIER ARE KNOWN TO CREATE MORE LATERAL CONACTIVITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE SO CALLED NEO QUARTEX AND THESE ARE LONG LASTING CHANGES THAT ARE THOUGHT TO UNDERLIE BOTH SOME OF THE RELIEF FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION BUT ALSO SOME OF THE ENHANCED CREATIVITY AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED WITH SYLICIV AN TREATMENT AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SYLICIVE AN TREATMENTS THAN SYLICIVE AN ITSELF PLEASE CHECK OUT THE EPISODE THAT DID ON SILICIV AN AND THE GEST EPISOD WITH DOCTOR ROBIN CARTHART HARRIS THOSE EPISODES LIKE ALL OTHER EPISODES OF THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST CAN BE FOUND AT HUBERMAN LABDOT COMMENTS OF FULLY SEARCHABLE SIT YOU CAN PUT KEYWARDS INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION IT WILL TAKE YOU TO SPECIFIC TIME STAMPS EVERY EPISODE IS TIME STAMPS YOU CAN NAVIGATE TO TOPICS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO YOU FEEL FREE TO GO THERE AND LISTEN TO THOSE EPISODES ABOUT SYLICIVAN EMDIAMAY BY CONTRAST DOES NOT SEEM TO PRODUCE LONG LASTING INCREASES IN LATERAL CONACTIVITY BETWEEN THOSE SAME BRAIN NETWORKS PROBA BLY BECAUSE IT IMPACTS A DIFFERENT CERETONE AN RECEPTORS IT DOES HOWEVER SEEM TO CHANGE RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONICTIVITY WITHIN THESE LIMBIC STRUCTURES LIKE THE EMIGDULA AND RELATED STRUCTURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THREAT DETECTION NOW THIS IS INTERESTING AND ACTUALLY WAS HIGHLIGHT VERY NICELY AN THAT STUDY ILL PROVIDE A LINK TUN AR SHOWNOUT CAPTION WHICH AS SHE HAS DOCTOR ROBIN CARDHARD HARRIS AS THE FIRST AUTHOR SO NOT ONLY HAS HE DONE INCREDIBLE WORK ON SILCEIBON AND ELIST AND DM T AND IWASKA IN HIS LABORATORY BUT ALSO ON M D MA AND THE PARTICULAR STUDY ON TH HAVIN MIND HERE SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO TAKE M D MA AT MORE LESS THE DOSAGES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER REPORT MARKED INCREASES IN POSITIVE MOOD AS WELL AS DECREASED BLOOD FLOW TO THE EMIGDULA AND HYPPOCAMPA SO AGAIN THESE THREAT DETECTION CENTERS OF THE BRAIN AND BRAIN AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH MEMORY AND THOSE CHANGES ARE SEEN BOTH WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M D M AND AFTERWARDS WHEN THE BRAIN IS SIMPLY AT REST SO IT REALLY DOES APPEAR THAT M D M A CREATES NERAL PLASTICITY THAT CHANGES THE OVERALL LEVEL OF ACTIVATION OF THESE THREATN DETECTION ET WORKS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS TO MEMORY SYSTEMS IN A WAY THAT'S PERVASIVE OVER TIME AND THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR PROBE WITH A NEGATIVE STIMULUS OW TRANSLATE TO ENGLISH WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT JURING THE M D MA SECTION PEOPLE REPORT FEELING LESS THREATENED MORE PRO SOCIAL TOWARDS OTHERS MORE IMPATHIC TOWARDS OTHERS AND THEMSELVES AND THAN AFTER THE SECTION THEY HAVE LESS OF A THREAT RESPONSE TO MEMORIES THAT BEFORE THE SECTION WERE MORE TROUBLING AND THOSE CHANGES IN THE BRAIN DO SEEM TO BE PERVASIVE SO THERE ARE BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM EFFECTS OF M D MA ALL OF WHICH POINT IN THE DIRECTION OF LOWERED LEVELS OF THREAT DETECTION HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF POSITIVITY PRO SOCIAL COMPONENTS OF THE BRAIN MORE ACTIVE THREAT DETECTION CENTERS OF THE BRAIN LESS ACTIVE NOW EARLIER W E TALKED ABOUT M D  MA AS A DRUG THAT POTENTLY INCREASES DOPOMINE AND EVEN MORE POTENTLY INCREASES CERETONAN LARGELY ACTING THROUGH THIS CERATONAN ONE B RECEPTOR NOW WITHOUT GETTING INTO TOO MANY MORE DETAILS BEFORE MOVING ON TO ISSUES OF PTOXICITY AROUND M D  MA I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON WHAT I THINK IS PERHAPS THE FINEST OF THE ANIMAL MODEL STUDIES OF M D  MA THAT EXPLORED WHICH BRAIN NET WORKS AND WHICH CHEMICAL THAT IS CERETONAN OR DOPOMIN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SAY THE MOTIVATIONAL COMPONENTS OF M D MA VERSES THE PROSOCIAL EFFECTS OF M D  MA AND THEN IT ALSO RAISES A REALLY IMPORTANTPOINT WHICH I HAVEN'T MENTIONED YET IN THIS EPISODE WHICH IS THE ROLL OF OXY TOSS AND SOMETHING THAT MANY YOUVE PERHAPS HEARD OF THE PAPER THEM TO DESCRIBE IS FROM THE LABORATORY OF DOCTOR ROBERT MALANCA HE'S A COLYGOMINE AT STAMPHOR UNIVERSY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SACATRIAN BEHAVIAL SCIENCES HE IS BOTH A PIONEER AND LUMINARY IN THE FIELD OF NEURO PLASTICITY OF HOW THE BRAIN WIRES AND FORMS MEMORIES AND CAN CHANGE ITSELF OVER TIME IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS THE STUDY OF DRUGS OF ABUSE AS WELL AS THE STUDY OF DRUGS LIKE M D  MA AND NOW ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS THAT CAN PROVIDE CERAPEUTIC SUPPORT IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE STUDY WHICH I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TOIN THE SHOWNO CAPTION IS ENTITLED DISTINCT NERAL MECHANISMS FOR THE PROSOCIAL AND REWARDING PROPERTIES OF M D  MA AND I'M JUST GOING TO SUMMARISE THE MAJOR RESULTS OF THE STUDY ITS A STUDY THAT WAS DONE ON MICE AND I REALIZE THAT LOT OF PEOPLE HEAR THAT THINK AH WHAT RELEVANCE DOES THAT HAVE TO HUMANS BUT WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF DOPOMINE AND CERETONAN IN THE TYPES OF CIRCUITS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THUS FAR THESE CIRCUITS THAT ARE SUB CORTICAL AS WE REFERD TO THEM SO THESE ARE LIMBIC CIRCUITS THESE ARE HYPOTHOLAMIC CIRCUITS THESE ARE WHAT ARE CALLED MEASA LYMBIC CIRCUITS THESE ARE ALL NAMES FOR CIRCUITS THAT ARE HIGHLY CONCERVED BETWEEN MICE AND HUMANS AND SO RESULTS IN MICE REALLY DO TRANSLATE QUITE WELL TO RESULTS IN HUMAN AT LEAST IN SO FAR AS THE EFFECTS OF M DAMA AND WHICH NOR CHEMICALS ARE INVOLVED IS CONCERNED SO WHAT THEY FOUND IN THE STUDY USING A HUGE ARRAY OF BEAUTIFUL TECHNIQUES SUCH AS INACTIVATION OF SPECIFIC BRAINARIES ACTIVATION OF SPECIFIC BRANARIS DRUG ANTAGONISTS TO PREVENT OXITOSIN FUNCTION OR DRUG ANTAGONISTS TO PREVENT SPECIFIC RECEPTERS INVOLVED IN THE CERATONA PATHWAY LOTS AND LOTS OF TOOLS IN THEIR TOOLCA WBAT THEY FOUND IS THAT M DIAMA CAUSING THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE IS WHAT REALLY ESTABLISHES THE REWARDING EFFECTS OF AN EXPERIENCE THIS ISN'T REALLY A SURPRISE WE'VE KNOWN THAT M DIAMA JUST LIKE COCANE OR METHEMPHETAMINE OR ATERALL FOR THAT MATTER OR VIVEANTS FOR THAT MATTER CREATES BIG INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THAT TEND TO COUPLE AN EXPERIENCE WITH A SENSE OF REWARD AND LEAD TO CHANGES IN THE NARAL CIRCUITRY THAT MAKE THE ANIMAL OR HUMAN MORE LIKELY TO SEEK OUT THAT SAME EXPERIENCE AGAIN AS ARE THE REWARDING OR SOMETIMES CALL REINFORCING PROPERTIES OF DOPAMINE THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE SO CALL MISO LYMBIC REWARD PATHWAY YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT MUSOLYMIC REWARD PATHWAYS AND DOPAMINE AND HOW THEY CONTROL EVERYTHING FROM YOUR LEVEL OF MOTIVATION TO YOUR TENDENCY TO PROCRASTINATE OR OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION DONE TWO EPISODES ABOUT DOPAMNE YOU CAN SIMPLY GO TO HUBRM LABDACOM PUT DOPAMINE INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION AND YOU'LL FIND AT LEAST TWO EPISODES ON THAT TOPIC AND YOU'LL ALSO FIND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TOOLS RELATED TO HOW ONE CAN BETTER REGULATE THEIR OWN PATTERNS OF DOPAMINE RELEASE FORSAKE OF MOTIVATION ET CETERA SO M DIAMA IS INCREASING DOPAMINE TO INCREASE REWARD TO A PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE WHAT'S THE EXPERIENCE WELL THIS PAPER BEAUTIFULLY PARSES THE FACT THAT IT IS SERATONEAN RELEASE WITHIN A STRUCTURE CALLED THE NUCLIOUS AC COMMONS WHICH IS PART OF THE REWARD PATHWAY WHICH IS REWARDING THE EXPERIENCE OF SOCIAL INTERACTION THEY DO THIS BY PUTTING MICE IN ARENAS WHERE THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF EITHER SPENDING TIME WITH OTHER MICE OR NOT SPENDING TIME WITH OTHER MICE AND BLOCK N THE ACTIVATION OF CERTAIN BRAIN AREAS AND AGAIN USING DRUG ANTAGONISTS ET CETERA AND WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT IT REALLY IS THE ACTIVATION OF THE CERATONE IN ONE B RECEPTOR IN THE NEWCLESACOMMONS BY M D MA THET LEADS TO THIS PROSOCIAL EFFECT OF M D MA SO THAT'S REALLY NICE TO KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS CONNUNDRUM OF OK SULCIVON AND ELIST ARE BASICALLY LIKE CERATONAN THEY ACTIVATE THE CARATONE AND TO A RECEPTOR M D MA HAS HIS HUGE CERATONURGET COMPONENT TONS OF CARATONEN RELEASED WHEN ONE TAKES M D MA BUT VERY DIFFERENT EFFECTS IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM VERY DIFFRENT SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS VERY DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF CHANGE ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM WELL THAT'S BECAUSE M D MA IS ACTIVATING THE CARATONEAND ONE BE RECEPTOR NOT THE CARATON AND TO A RECEPTOR IN ITS DOING SO IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SET OF BRAIN NETWORKS AS IS ELIST AND SCILICEIBON SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN ANIMAL ARE A PERSON TAKES M D MA IS THAT SOCIAL CONNECTION IS STRONGLY REWARDED AND REINFORCED MAKING SOCIAL CONNECTION MORE LIKELY AFTER THE DRUG WEARS OFF THAT'S ONE COMPONENT OF SOCIAL CONNECTION BUT IN ADITION PEOPLE WHO TAKE M D MA IN THE CLINICAL THERAPEUTIC SETTING FOR THE TREATMENT OF P T ST OFTEN REPORT FEELING MORE EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR THEMSELVES DURING THE SESTION BUT ALSO FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME MAY BE EVEN INDEFINITELY AFTER THE SESTION SO IT REALLY SEEMS THAT THE EDITION OF THIS HUGE RELEASE OF SERATONAN BY M D MA ON TOP OF THE RELEASE OF DOPOMINE SETS IN MOTION TOO PARALLEL CIRCUITS ONE FOR REWARDING SOMETHING ANYTHING THAT'S THE DOPOMINE COMPONENT AND THEN FORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE INCREASE IN CRATONIN CAUSE BY M D MA INCREASES MPATHY AND SOCIABILITY FOR AND WITH OTHERS BUT ALSO FOR ONESELF THE MOTIVATION THAT'S REINFORCED THAT'S WIRED INTO THE BRAIN SEEMS TO BE E MOTIVATION TO PERCEIVE OTHERS AS MORE KIND BUT ALSO TO BE KINDER TO ONESSELF NOW I REALIZE THAT FOR SOME OF YOU WHO ARE LISTENING TO THIS YOUR PELISAYING WELL OF COURSE I YOU KNOW CERATONAN IS PROSOCIAL AND DOPOMINAS MOTIVATION SO YOU PUT THE TWO TOGETHER AND PEOPLE BECOME MORE MOTIVATED TO BE SOCIAL AND KINDER TO THEMSELVES AH BUT IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE THAT WAY RIHT IT IS VERY HARD TO GO FROM A STATEMENT LIKE DRUG A PRODUCES EFFECTS B C IND TO NOR CHEMICALS B C IND CAUSE MOTIVATION AND SOCIABILITY AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU TAKE THAT DRUG YOU'RE GING TO GET ALL OF THAT STUFF IN FACT WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO OUR UNDERSTANDING THE EMDIAMA DESPITE CAUSING A BIG INCREASE IN CERATONAN ALSO CAUSES HUGE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE AND IT DOES SO WITH THIS MOLECULE THAT IS METHEM PHEDEMINE NOW METHEM PHEDAMINE IS NOT KNOWN TO BE A PRO SOCIAL DRUG IN FACT THE STUDY I JUST REFERRED TO AS WELL AS SOME HUMAN STUDIES HAVE EXPLORED HOW THE APPLICATION OF METHEM PHEDEMINE SO NOT EMDIAMA BUT PUREMETHEM FHEDEMINE IMPAC SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND WHAT IT DOES TO SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ITS VERY PROFOUND IT DRAMATICALLY REDUCES ONE'S TENDENCY TO INGAGE IN SOCIAL INTERACTION SO THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO THE POLYPHARMOCOLOGY AS IT'S CALLED OF EM DIAMA THE FACT THAT SCERATONAN END DOPOMIN A RELEASE TOGETHER HAS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT EFFECTS THAN IF JUST DOPOMIN OR JUST CERATONAN IS INCREASED SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S WORTH TAKING A STEP BACK AND TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER CLASS OF DRUGS WHICH DRAMATICALLY INCREASES CERATONAN WHICH ARE THE S S ORISE THE SELECTIVE CERATONAN REUPTAKE INHIBITERS ESESARISE SUCH AS FLOXITINE PROSAC AS WELL AS ZOLOFT AND OF COURSE THEIRE MANY OTHER ASCESSORISE OUT THEIR CETALOPRAUM ET CETERA THEY BLOCK THE REUPTAKE OF CERATONIAN AND THEREBY LEAD TO NET INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF CERATONAN AND YET THOSE DRUGS ARE NOT KNOWN TO CREATE EVEN CLOSE TO THE SAME SORTS OF EFFECTS AS M D  M A IN FACT THERE HAVE BEEN HUMAN ANANIMAL STUDY SHOWING THAT IF YOU GIVE SOMEBODY AN ESCESS OR I PRIOR TO THM TAKING M D M A YOU ACTUALLY BLOCK THE PROSOCIAL AND IMPATHAGENIC EFFECTS OF M D M A NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THAT BE AREN'T THESE DRUGS JUST INCREASING CERETONAN AND THE INCREASE IN CERETONAN IS PROSOCIAL ET CETERA AH WELL THAT SPEAKS TO THE COMPLEXITY OF ALL THIS POLLYPHARMACHOLOGY AND THE FACT THAT IT'S REALLY THE ACTIVATION OF CERETONAN AT PARTICULAR RECEPTORS IN THIS CASE THE CERETONE AN ONE B RECEPTER IN PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS IN THIS CASE THE NUCLYOS ECCUMBENTS A BRAINARY ASSOCIATED WITH MOTIVATION AND REWARD THAT LARGELY EXPLAINS THE EFFECTS OF M D MA IN MAKING PEOPLE AN ANIMALS AND OCTIPUSIS INCLUDED FOR THAT MATTER MORE PROSOCIAL AND MORE IMPATHIC TOWARDS THEMSELVES IT'S NOCIOUS AN ISSUE OF RAISING THE LEVELS OF ONE NARROW CHEMICAL IT'S REALLY ABOUT RAISING LEVELS OF A PARTICULAR NERCHEMICAL ACTING A PARTICULAR RECEPTORS IN PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS AND IN THE CASE OF M D M A THE FACT THAT THERE'S ALSO DOPOMINE INCREASED IN THOSE VERY SAME BRAIN AREAS AND I DON'T THINK I MENTION THIS BEFORE BUT THE NUCLEOUS ACUMBENS IS PART OF THAT MUSOLYMBIC REWARD PATHWAY THAT IS ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISHING A REWARD FOR WHATEVER IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT SO THE WAYS TO CONCEPTIALIZE EMDIAMA AN ITS EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN BOTH SUBJECTIVELY AND MECHANISTICALLY IS THAT IT'S AN IMPATHAGEN FOR WHICH EMPATHY AND SOCIAL CONNECTION IS VERY STRONGLY REINFORCE WHILE UNDER TE INFLUENCE OF THE DRUG AND IN A WAY SO INTENSE AND POWERFUL THAT THOSE NURL NETWORKS GET STRONGER AND PERSIST IN BEING MORE ACTIVE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AFTER THE DRUG HAS WORN OFF NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN EXPLORED IN BOTH THE ANIMAL LITERATURE AND THE HUMAN LITERATURE IS THAT M DI AMA DOESN'T JUST INCREASE DOPOMINE AND DOESN'T JUST INCREASE SERATONAN BUT IT ALSO PROFOUNDLY INCREASES LEVELS OF OXY TOST AND RELEASE IN THE BRAIN NOW OXY TOSIN IS CONSIDERED WHAT'S CALLED A NEURO HORMONE BECAUSE IT ACTS AS BOTH A NEURO TRANSMITTER OR I GUESS IF WE WERE GOING TO BE REALLY SPECIFIC WED SAY A NEUROMODULATER BECAUSE IT TENDS TO MODULATE THE ACTIVITY OF A BUNCH OF OTHER CIRCUITS AND A HORMON HOW CAN WE SAY IT'S A HORMON OR A MODULATOR OR TRANSMITTER WHELL HORMONAL EFFECTS TEND TO BE EFFECTS THAT ACT NOT JUST LOCALLY BUT ON MANY SITES WITHIN THE BRAIN AND BODY AS WELL AN OXY TOSIN IS KNOWN TO DO THAT AS WELL AS TO WORK LOCALLYES THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A NEURO HORMON IT ACTIVATES NERONS AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH NERAL NETWORKS RELATED TO PARBONDING BOTH BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD AND FATHER AND CHILD OR CARETAKER AND CHILD NOT JUST BIOLOGICAL PARENT AS WELL AS BONDING BETWEEN FRIENDS BONDING BETWEEN LOVERS AND IT'S THOUGHT TO ACTUALLY BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS THAT IS THE PAINFUL PROCESS OF BREAKING OF BONDS WHEN PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO US AS CARETAKERS OR AS PARTNERS EITHER BY WAY OF BREAK UP DEATH DEPARTURE ET CETERA IN FACT TARE EVEN DATA SUGGESTING THAT HUMANS CAN HAVE STRONG OXY TOS AN RESPONSES TO THEIR PETS IN PARICULAR DOGS AND THEIR DOGS CAN HAVE STRONG OXY TOSAN PATTERNS OF RELEASE IN RESPONSE TO THEIR OWNERS I THINK FOR ANY DOG LOVERS OR DOGOWNERS CERTAINY INCLUDES ME I'M RAISING MY HAND THAT COMES IS NO SURPRISE ANYONE THAT'S EVER HAD TO PUT DOWN A DOGER HAS LOST A DOG AND HERE NO DISRESPECT TO THE CATOWNERS BUT JUST REFERRING TO THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON HUMANS AND DOGS YOU CAN CERTAINLY RELATE TO THE INCREDIBLE PAIN OF THAT LOSS OXYTOSIN IS THOUGHT TO BE INVOLVED IN BONDING BETWEEN PEOPLE AND OTHER CREATURES AS WELL AS THE BREAKING OF THOSE BONDS M D AMA IS KNOWN TO POWERFULLY INCREASE OXYTOST AND RELEASE IN FACT THERE'S A REALLY NICE STUD Y ON THIS DONE INHUMANS THIS IS A STUDY ALL PROVIDED LINK TO IN THE SHONOTE CAPTIONS ENTITLED PLASMA OXY TOSING CONCENTRATIONS FOLLOWING M D M A OR INTRENASAL OXY TOSIN IN HUMANS NOWDAYS OXY TOSIN IS AVAILABLE BY NASAL AND HAILOR TO BE ONCID DON'T KNOW THE LEGALITY AROUND IT I DON'T KNOW IF ITS GREY MARKET OR BUT WHAT IAM ABOUT TO TELL YOU WILL ABASICALLY DISCOURAGE YOU FROM WANTING TO TAKE IT BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND IN THE STUDY WAS PEOPLE GIVEN EITHER POINT SEVEN FIVE OR ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILOGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT OF M D M A EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN OXY TOSIN HOWEVER IT WAS ONLY THE GROUP THAT TOOK ONE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS PER KILIGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT OF M D M A THAT EXPERIENCE THE REALLY BIG SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OXYTOSIN AND WHEN I SAY REALLY BIG REALLY HIGHLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT THEY OBSERVED IS THAT IN THE PLACIBO GROUP AS OF COURSE THEY INCLUDEED PLACIBO GROUP THE AMOUNT OF CIRCULATING OXY TOSIN WAS EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PEKOGRAMS PER MILL LEADER WHICH TO YOU PROBABLY MEANS NOTHING AND TO ME ALSO SORT OF MEANS NOTHING BECAUSE THOSE UNITS OF OXY TOSIN I CAN'T BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ANY KIND OF DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF FEELING BONDED OR NOT BONDED THE SYSTEN NUMBER BUT NONE THE LESS IT PROVIDES A BASE LINE TO COMPARE TO THE AVERAGE LEVELS OF OXYTOSIN IN THE BLOOD STREAM OF PEOPLE THAT WERE GIVENG ONE POINT FIVE MELIGRAMS FORCULEGRAM OF M D M A WHICH IS EIGHTY THREE POINT SEVEN PEKAGRAMS PERMILL LEADER THAT ECQUATES TO NEARLY A FIVEFOLD INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CIRCULATING OXY TOSIN WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M D M A NOW THIS STUDY HAD A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS NOTJUST M DI A MA OF DIFFERENTOSES NOTJUST PLACIBO THEY ALSO HAD PEOPLE TAKE OXY TOIN BY NASAL SPRAY WHICH WE KNOW CAN CHANGE LEVELS OF CIRCULATING OXY TOSIN AND INDEED WHEN MEASURED IN THE STUDY IT DID CHANGE LEVELS OF CIRCULATING OXY TOSIN AND THE END POINT IN THE STUDY WAS TO HAVE PEOPLE GIVE SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF THEIR FEELINGS OF CONNECTEDNESS TO ONE ANOTHER AS WELL AS RATE AND HERE IAM JUST DRAWING DIRECTLY FROM THE PAPER OF HOW MUCH THEY LIKE THE FEELING HOW MUCH THEY FELT HIGH THEY MEASURE THE HEART RATE THEIR SOSTOLIC PRESSURE O THE DIOSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE ET CETERA AND THEY LOOKED AT HOW SOCIAL PEOPLE FELT THEY LOOKED AT HOW INCITEFUL PEOPLE FELT AND THE KEY TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY FOR SAKE OF OUR DISCUSSION HERE TO DAY IS THAT IT DOES NOT AGAIN IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE INCREASES IN OXYTOSIN PRODUCED BY TAKING M D MA OR THE SOURCE OF THE PRO SOCIAL EFFECTS OF M D MA AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT WAS FOUND IN THE ANIMAL STUDIES OF M  MA WHERE IN THOSE STUDIES MICE WERE GIVEN M D MA AT COMPARABLE DOSES THE DOSES WERE LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN USE IN THE HUMAN STUDIES BUT AT COMPARABLE DOSES BIG INCREASES IN OXYTOAN WERE OBSERVED INCREASES IN SOCIABILITY OF THOSE MICE WERE OBSERVED JUST AS THEY ARE IN HUMANS THAT TAKE M D MA BUT IN THOSE MICE THEY WERE ALSO GIVEN A DRUG TO BLOCK THE OXYTOSAN RECEPTOR AND LOW AND BEHOLD NO CHANGES IN SOCIABILITY WERE OBSERVED IN HUMANS THAT TAKE OXYTOSEN BY NASAL SPRAY YOU CAN SEE BIG INCREASES IN OXYTOSEN THAT'S NOT SURPRISING GETS ACROSS THE BLUPBERIN BARRIER OXY TOSIN GOES UP AND LEVELS OF SOCIABILITY DO NOT INCREASE SO WHAT THIS POINTS TO IS A SITUATION WHERE M D MA IS INCREASING DOPOMINE TO INCREASE MOTIVATION AND TO REWARD SOMETHING WHAT GETS REWARDED WELL WHAT GETS REWARDED IS THE SERATONE AN ACTIVATION OF PARTICULAR BRAIN NETWORKS ASSOCIATE WITH SOCIABILITY AND THE DRAMATIC INCREASES IN OXYTOS IN THAT ARE VERY VERY REAL WHEN PEOPLE TAKE M D MA DO NOT APPEAR TO UNDERLIE ANY OF THE KNOWN SHORT OR LONG TERM SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF M D MA NOW A CONCLUSION LIKE THAT NEEDS TO HAVE A CAVIAT AN THE CAVIAT IS THAT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THE BIG INCREASES IN OXYTOSIN THAT ARE PRODUCED BY MD A MA AREN'T DOING ANYTHING FOR THE SORTS OF AFFACTS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE SOCIABILITY EMPATHY ET CETERA BUT THERE COULD BE OTHER EFFECTS OF OXYTOSIN THAT WERE JUST NOT AWARE OF THAT SAID THE DATA FROM BOTH ANIMAL MODELS AND IN HUMANS REALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT THE INCREASES IN OXYTOSIN THAT ARE PRODUCED BY M DI A MA ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO ANY OF THE SHORT AND LONG TERM EFFECTS OF EMDIA MA THAT WE ARE MOST FAMILIAR WITH NAMELY MOTIVATION SOCIABILITY INCREASE EMPATHY OR THE LONG STANDING CHANGES IN NERAL CIRCUITRY THAT UNDERLIE FOR INSTANCE REDUCE THREAT DETECTION OR REDUCE CONICTIVITY BETWEEN THRECTITETION CENTERS OF THE BRAIN AND IN TERROCEPTION SO IS THE BIG INCREASE IN OXYTOSIN PRODUCE BY M DI A MA COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT IN THE CONTECTS OF THIS DISCUSSION WE DON'T KNOW IT APPEARS THAT IT'S NOT VERY RELEVANT IS OXYTOSIN A MEANINGLESS MOLECULE RIGHT AFTER ALL THAT GAVE THESE PEOPLE NASAL INFUSIONS OF OXYTOSIN OXYTOSIN WENT WAY UP IT IN OBSERVE ANYTHING VERY INTERESTING OR SIGNIFICANT IN THE CONTECTS OF SOCIABILITY BUT WE DO KNOW THAT OXYTOSIN CAN PLAY A POWERFUR ROLE IN PERABONDING AND IN HUMAN HUMAN HUMAN ANIMAL BONDING OF VARIOUS KINDS FROM OTHER EXPERIMENTS OF THE BEEN DONE SO I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE INCREDIBLE POWER THAT OYTOSIN HAS IN OUR BRAINS AND BODIES BUT IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THE M D  MA INDUCED INCREASES IN OXY TOSEN WHICH ARE ENORMOUS HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH ANYTHING RELATED TO THE VALUE OF M DI A MA AS A TREATMENT FOR PITIESTI OR FOR ITS SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS ON EMPATHY SOCIABILITY OR ANY OF THOSE OTHER FACTORS EITHER NOW PERHAPS THE ONE CAVIAT TO THAT IS THAT HARRIET DEITS LABORATORY WHICH I REFERRED TO EARLIER HAS LOOKED AT HOW VARIATIONS IN OXY TOSIN RECEPTOR GENES VARY BETWEEN PEOPLE SO IT TURNS OUT THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE IN ALLEAL A BASICALLY AVERSION OF THE OXYTOST EN RECEPTOR THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE THAT MAKES OT CITOSIN WORK DIFFERENTLY AN ACTUALL LESS EFFECTIVELY IN ACTIV ATING CERTAIN BRAN NETWORKS AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT WHEN THOSE PEOPLE TAKE M D  MA THEY ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE LESS OF A PROSOCIAL EFFECT OF THE DRUG NOW THAT SPITS IN THE FACE OF EVERYTHING I JUST SAID ABOUT OXYTOSAND NOT BEING INVOLVED IN THE EFFECTS OF M D  MA ON PROSOCIABILITY AND EMPATHY I THINK THE BULK OF THE DATA REALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT IT'S THE CERETONAN INCREASES COMBINED WITH THE DOPOMIN INCREASES CAUSED BY M D  MA THAT LEAD TO MOST OF THE UNDERSTOOD EFFECTS ANDTHAT OXYTOSIN IF ITS PLAYING A ROLE IS GOING TO PLAY A MORE MINOR ROLL LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY AND POTENTIAL NAUROTOXICITY OF M D  MA AND HERE I REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR DISCUSSION TO DAY IS COUCHED IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF PURE M D  MA TO ANIMALS OR HUMANS IN THE CONTEXT OF LABORATORY OR CLINICAL STUDIES THIS IS REALLY IMPORTAN TO POINT OUT BECAUSE I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T NOTE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF RECREATIONAL USE OF M D  MA IN FACT IT WAS THE RECREATIONAL USE OF M D  MA IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT REALLY THAT TOOK OFF EVEN EXPLODED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WAS SO CALLED RAVE CULTURE THAT CREATED THE MASSIVE ATTENTION ON ILLEGALITY OF M D  MA AND PUT THE DRUG INFORCEMENT AGENCIES ON TO M D  MA AS A DRUG THAT THEY WANTED TO AND INDEED DU RESTRICT IN FACT JUST TO DAY ON INANTICIPATION OF THIS EPISODE I PUT MD  MA INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION ON GUGELL AND CLICKED NEWS AND THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO REPORTS OF MAJOR M D  MA SIZURES AND BUS SO AGAIN I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT MD  MA IS STILLY LEGAL TO POSSESS OR CELL AN CERTAINLY TO TRAFFIC I ALSO WANT TO HIHLIGHT THE FACT THAT NOWADAYS ALL RECREATIONAL DRUGS BUT CERTAINLY MD  MA INCLUDED ARE OFTEN FACT VERY FTEN CONTIAMINATED WITH FENTINEL AND WHILE FENTINEL HAS CERTAIN CLINICAL USES FENTINEL IS HIGHLY DEADLY THE CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE AS MUCH AS SIXTY PER CENT MAYBEVEN EIGHBE PER CENT OF DRUGS THAT ARE SOLD ON THE GREYMARKET ARE BEING REPACKAGED OR REFORMULATED WITH PENTINEL AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PENTINAL RELATED DEATHS BOTH IN KIDS AND ADULTS SO THE SORCING OF EM DIAMA IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THE SAFETY ISSUES SIMPLY CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED AND I SAY THAT NOT TO PROTECTMI I SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU RIGHT THE LAST THING ANY OF US WANT IS FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE A COMPOUND THINKING ITS ONE COMPOUND AND IT CONTAINS ANOTHER COMPOUND AND THEM GETTING HURT OR EVEN DYING AND THAT IS HAPPENING A LOT A LOT AND IT IS CERTAINLY HAPPENING LOT FOR YU TET THINK THAT THERE BUYING EMDI M THE USE OF M DI ME IN THE LABORATORY OR IN THE CLINICAL SETTING WITH PURE EM DI ME HAS ALSO BEEN EXPLORED FOR THE POTENTIAL NAUROTOXICITY OF EM DI ME SO HOW WOULD METHEMPHEDEMINE AND EM DI MA BE NUROTOXIC WELL THAT'S BECAUSE THEY INCREASE DOPOMINE IN THE CASE OF METHEMPHEDEMIN AND DOPOMINE IN CERATONAN IN THE CASE OF M DI ME AND THEY DO SO TO A VERY HIGH DEGREE THE BIG INCREASES IN DOPOMINE AND CERATONUM BUT IN PARTICULAR THE BIG INCREASES IN DOPOMINE TEN TO PROMOTE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS REMEMBER THESE ARE AFTER ALL NUROMODULATORS THEY MODULY UP OR DOWN THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS AND DOPOMINE TENDS TO MODULATE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS UP SO DOOMINE ITSELF IS NOT NAROTOXIC BUT WHEN A LOT OF DOPOMINE IS RELEASED IT IS NEROTOXIC AND IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT EVEN A SINGLE DOSE OF METHEMPHEDEMINE CAN BE NUROTOXIC NOTJOUS FOR DOPOMIE NURONS BUT FOR OTHER TYPES OF NURONS AS WELL INCLUDING SERATONURGECT NURONS PUT DIFFERENTLY WE KNOW THAT THE BRAINS OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE METHEMPHEDEMINE DEGENERATE TO A SMALL OR TWO A LARGE DEGREE DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN THEY TAKE THE DRUG HOW POTEN THE DRUG IS AND WHETHER NOT THEY COMBINEANT WITH OTHER DRUGS AND YES IF YOU HEARD THAT COMBINING CAFFINE WITH MPHETAMINES CAN INCREASED THE NURATOXICITY OF MPHEDEMINE SUCH AS METHEM PHEDING THAT IS TRUE IF YOU HEARD THAT TAKING KAFFHINE WITHIN THE HOURS OR SAME DAY AS M D AMA CAN INCREASE THE TOISITY OF M D  MA THAT DOES APPEAR TO BE TRUE BASED ON ANIMAL STUDIES NOW THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF STUDIES LOOKING AT THE TOISITY OF M D  MA IN HUMANS BUT THERE ARE A FEW THERE ARE ALSO STUDIES LOOKING AT THE TOXISTY OF M D  MA IN ANIMAL MODELS INCLUDING NON HUMAN PRIMATE MODELS NOW THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX LITERATURE A LOT OF RESULTS NOT ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT THE'RE SCATTERED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS FIRST OF ALL SOME OF THE ANIMAL STUDIES HAVE USED DOSAGES OF M D  MA AS HIGH AS TWO MELIGRAMS POR KILEGRAMA BODYWEIGHT AS HIGH AS THREE MELIGRAMS PER KILEGRAMA BODYWEIGHT AND EVEN IN UPWARDS OF THAT BUT EVEN FOR THE ANIMAL STUDIES THAT USED ARRANGE OF DOSAGES FROM POINT SEVEN FIVE TO ONE POINT FIVE MELEGRAMS FOR KILEGRAMA BODYWEIGHT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT IN LABORATORY MISER RATS THERE CAN BE SOME LOSS OF SARATONERGIC TONE IN THE BRAINS OF ANIMALS THAT HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED M D  MA NOW NOTICE I SAID SERATONERGIC TONE I DIDN'T SAY SARATONAN NURONS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT M D  MA WORKS IN ENCOURAGING OR PROMOTING BIG RELEASES IN DOPEMING BIG RELEASES IN CERATONAN IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT IF THE ANIMALS THAT WERE GIVEN M D  MA ARE SUBSEQUENTLY SACRIFICED SAY LATER THAT DAY OR THE NEXT DAY RMAYBE EVEN A WEEK OR TWO WEEKS LATER AND THOSE BRAINS ARE STAINED FOR PROTINES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE SYNTHESIS OR RELEASE OF SRATONAN IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE WOULD BE REDUCTIONS IN THOSE SORTS OF PROTINES RIGHT AFTER ALL A LOT OF DDOPENING IN CERATONEN IS RELEASED AND IT CAN BE DEPLETED BUT I SHOULD POINT OUT DEPLETION OF ANAROMODULATOR IN THE SHORT TERM IS NOT THE SAME THING AS DEPLETION OF THAT NUROMODULATOR IN THE LONG TERM NORS AT THE SAME AS LOSS OF THE NURONS THAT RELEASED DOPEMING IN CARATONAN ITSELF SO THERE ARE DATA POINTING TO THE FACT THAT REPEATED AN MINISTRATION OF M D ME AT DOSAGES THAT ARE VERY MUCH WITHIN LINES WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY ONE POINT FIVE MELIGRAMS FOR KILEGRAMIF BODYWAIGHT CAN LOWER TOTAL AMOUNTS OF CERATONIAN OR OTHER PROTINES IN THE CERATONE AN SYNTHESIS PATHWAY OR DOPOMINE OR PROACHINGS THAT ARE IN THE DOPOMING SYNTHESIS PATHWAY IN SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE BRAIN RELATED TO REENFORCEMENT RELATED TO MOOD RELATED TO MOTIVATION ET CETERA HOWEVER THE PRIMATE STUDIES ARE I SHOULD SAY THE NON HUMAN PRIMATE STUDIES WHICH ARE THE SORTS OF ANIMAL STUDIES THAT MOST CLOSELY MIMIC WHAT ONE EXPECSTASY IN THE HUMAN BRAIN BECAUSE AFTER ALL MICE AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE DRUGS AND MICE DO TRANSLATE TO HUMANS BUT IT'S THOUGHT THAT NON HUMAN PRIMATES PROVIDE A MODEL THAT'S FAR MORE SIMILAR TO HUMANS THERE THE DATA START TO GET KIND OF COMPLICATED IN A WAY THAT SUGGEST THAT EMDIA MAY MIGHT NOT BE AS NEROTOXIC AS IS THOUGHT BASED ON THE ROAD ET STUDIES AND THIS GETS INTO A WHOLE HISTORY OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DIFFERENT LABORATORIES AND GOVERNING BODIES WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP EMDIA MA LEGAL AS WELL AS PEOPLE SUCH AS THE SASHOSCHULGANS OF THE WORLD AND PEOPLE IN THE THERAPE COMMUNITY THAT ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR EMDIA MA BECOMING LEGAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF P T ST AND IT REALLY CENTERS AROUND ONE OR TWO STUDIES BOTH OF WHICH WERE PUBLISHING VERY HIGH PROFILE JOURNALS AND THE ONE THAT ALL HIGH LIGHT BECAUSE THE RESULTS ARE NOW VERY CLEAR AND CONCLUSIVE IS A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWO WHICH WAS ENTITLED SEVERE DOPOMINTROGIC NEROTOXICITY IN PRIMATES AFTER A COMMON RECREATIONAL DOSE REGIMENT OF EM DI A MA OR ECSTASY THIS PAPER WAS PUBLISHING THE JOURNAL SCIENCE WHICH IS ONE OF THE THREE APEX JOURNALS FOR PUBLISHING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SO THERES SCIENCE NATURE AND SELL THE TOP TOP JOURNALS MOST RINGENT JOURNALS TO GET SCIENTIFIC MANUSCRIPTS INTO THE PAPER RECEIVED A LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BASED ON THE TITLE IT SUGGESTED THAT EVEN RE CREATIONAL DOSES OF ECSTASY EVEN OF ITS PURE ECSTASY AND IT DOESN'T HAVE CONTAMINATION FROM ADDITIONAL METHEMPHEDAMINE OR OTHER THINGS IN IT IS NERATOXIC TO CERTAINURGIC ND OR DOPOMENURGIC NURONS THIS IS LARGELY WHERE M D MA GOT THE REPUTATION FOR QUOT IN UO PUTTING HOLES IN YOUR BRAIN HOWEVER THIS STUDY CAME UNDER A LOT OF SCRUTINY FOR COUPLE OF REASONS FIRST OF ALL AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THIS BUT IT WAS ARGUED THAT THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY WERE PERHAPS TRYING TO PREVENT THE LEGALIZATION OF M D M FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT ST AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE'S NO DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT THAT STATEMENT IS TRUE BUT YOU WILL ACTUALLY FIND THAT IN SOME OF THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IN FACT I WAS ABLE TO FINDA A AN EDITORIAL THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE BIOMEDICAL JOURNAL AND TWO THOUSAND THREE A WHICH ARGUED SOMEHOW THAT A DOCTOR RECUARTE I WAS ACCUSED OF QUOTE RUSHING HIS RESULTS INTO PRINT BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION DESIGN TO CURB ECSTASY USE ON BEFORE YOU ES CONGRESS O YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME A A CONNOTATIONS OR I RATHER THERE WERE SOME STRONG SUGGESTIONS THAT THERE WAS A POLITICAL BACKING TO TRYN TO GET THE STUDY DONE QUICKLY AND INTO PRINT AND SO FORTH I DON'T THINK THAT EVER REALLY GOT RESOLVED WHAT DID GET RESOLT HOWEVER IS THAT THE VERY STUDY IN QUESTION WAS RETRACTED O CASE SO THE AUTHORS THEMSELVES PUBLISH A LETTER OF RETRACTION THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT AS WELL RECOGNIZED AS THE PAPER THAT STIMULATED THIS IDEA THAT M D MAAS NERATOIC IN PRIMATES AND KEEP IN MIND THAT WE ARE HUMAN PRIMATES NON HUMAN PRIMATES BEING THE CLOSEST MODELED HUMAN PRIMATES THAT WE ARE AWARE OF BUT TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT THERE WERE SOME ISSUES OF LABELLING OF M D MA VERSES OTHER DRUGS IN THE LABORATORY THERE WERE SOME ISSUES OF MISLABELLING ALL OF WHICH WERE EVENTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY AND THEY CONCLUDED IN FACT THEY VERIFIED BASED ON SOME VERY DETAILED ANALYSIS THAT WHAT THESE MONKEYS WERE INJECTED WITH WAS NOT ACTUALLY M D M A BUT R ATHER WAS MET M PHEDEMINE ITSELF SO WHAT'S NOT OFTEN ACKNOWLEDGED IS THE RETRACTION OF THE PAPER ON NEROTOXICITY AND UNFORTUNATELY THE NEUROTOXICITY ISSUE IS OFTEN WHAT'S MENTIONE NOW KEEP IN MINE THERE ARE STUDIES IN RODENS SHOWING NEROTOXICITY OF M D  MA PERHAPS EVEN AT RECREATIONAL DOSES BUT TO DATE AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY DATA IN EITHER NONHUMAN PRIMATES OR IN HUMANS SHOWING TOXICITY OF M D  MA AT CLINICALLY RELEVANT DOSEIS PROVIDED IT IS PURE M D  MA I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR I AM NOT SAYING THAT IF YOU CAN GET PURE M D  MA THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE IT OR THAT IT WON'T BE NEUROTOXIC CERTAINLY WE CAN EXPECT THAT BECAUSE OF THE HUGE KNOWN VARIATION IN DOPEMING RECEPTORS IN CEROTONAN RECEPTORS AND OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THE KNOWN INTERACTIONS BETWEEN M D  MA AND OTHER COMPOUNDS IN PARTICULAR CAFHINE BUT ALSO DRUGS SUCH AS COCANE OR OTHER STIMULANTS THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EXPERIENCE MORE TOXACITY TO A GIVEN DOSE OF M D  MA COMPARED TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO DETECT THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEUROTOXICITY NOW WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION THAT HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF M D  MA ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO TWO HUNDRED OR SOMETIMES EVEN IN EXCESS OF FOUR HUNDRED DOSES OF M D  MA AND THERE NOW HARE STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE NEROTOTICITY AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THE NEUROCOGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF TAKING M D  MA EITHER ZEROTIMES ONE TIME FIVE TIMES FORTY TIMES TWO HUNDRED TIMES ET CETERA ET CETERA AND ONE OF THE WHAT IOULD CONSIDER LANDMARK STUDIES IN THIS AREA IS A STUDY ENTITLED RECIDUAL NOROCOGNIIVE FEATURES OF LONG TERM ECSTASY USERS WITH MINIMAL EXPOSURE TO OTHER DRUGS AND THOSE WORDS WITH MINIMAL EXPOSURE TO OTHER DRUGS IS REALLY KEY IN THE CONTEXTS OF THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE AS I MENTION BEFORE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DRUGS WHAT'S CALLED POLLY FORMICOLOGY CAN CREATE NEROTOXICITY IT'S ON CLEAR OF EMDIAMA IS NERATOXIC BUT WE KNOW METHEMPHEDEMINE ON ITS OWN IS NERATOXIC WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE OFTEN WILL COMBINE MD AMA AND METHEM HEDEMINE WE ALSO KNOW THAT A LOT OF SO CALLED M D MA OUT THERE IS MOSTLY METHAM PHEDEMINE WITH ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF M D MA SO A STUDY OF THE SORT THAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE WHERE IT IS ESSENTIALLY CONFIRMED THAT PEOPLE WERE TAKING PURE M D MA AND NOT TAKING ANY OTHER DRUGS IS OF IMMENSE VALUE THIS STUDY HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT CONTROVERSIAL A IN FACT IE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE A TALKED ABOUT THE JOROGAN PODCAST I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BRIEFLY WITH A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST DOCTOR NOLLAND WILLIAMS WHOSE HE TRIPLE BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN PSYCHATRIS AND NEUROLOGIST AT SAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND IT'S AN INTERESTING STUDY IN ELOBIC CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE IT RELIED ON A POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN M DIAME ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO TWO HUNDRED TIMES AND WHO NOT TAKEN ANY OTHER DRUGS INCLUDING KAFINE AND THE POPULATION IN MINED HERE IS A POPULATION PEOPLE LIVING IN UTA WHO SELF IDENTIFY AS MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS SOMETIMES REFERED TO HIS MORMONS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO HIS EL D S OR OF THE CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS THE CHURCH OF LATTERDAY SAINTS AS I UNDERSTAND DOES NOT ALLOW FOR TAKING OF CERTAIN COMPOUND CERTAIN DRUGS AM CERTAIN CERTAINLY MOST RECREATIONAL DRUGS ALCOHOL EVEN KAFINE AND I'M SURE THERE'E SOME VARIATION ON SOME OF THOSE THEMES DEPENDING ON A WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN I AM IN NO WAYTHAPER FORM A DECLARING THAT IM AN EXPERT ON A LATTER DAY SAINTS I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE EL D S HAVEEANBE VERY NICE PEOPLE AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY WERE NOT THE PEOPLE  IN THIS STUDY BUT THIS STUDY REALLY EMPHASIZED ECSTASY USERS THEYRE CALLED WHO HAVE NOT TAKEN OTHER DRUGS WHO SELF IDENTIFY AS ELD S AND THE MAJOR TAKE AWAY OF THIS STUDY WAS THAT FOR MODERATE MEANING PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN ECSTASY ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY TWO TO FIFTY TIMES IN THEIR LIFETIME AS WELL AS HEAVY USERS OF M D MA SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN EMDYAMA ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY SIX ZERO TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES IN THEIR LIFETIME THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF DECREASED COGNAT PERFORMANCE IN STANDARD ASSAYS FOR COGNATE PERFORMANCE NOW THERE WERE SOME EFFECTS SHOWING POOR HEREEM QUOTING FROM THE FINDINGS POOR STRATEGRIC SELF REGULATION QUOT POSSIBLY REFLECTING INCREASED IMPULSIVITY HOWEVER WHEN YOU SEE A CONCLUSION LIKE THAT YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE THINKING CHICKEN VERSES EGG RIGHT IT COULD BE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE MORE IMPULSIVE AND THAT HAVE LESS STRATEGIC SELF REGULATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE ECSTASY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES YOU COLD CONCLUDE THAT OR YOU COULD CONCLUDE THAT PEOPLE WHOVE TAKN ECSTASY SEVENTY FIVE TIMES OR TWENTY FIVE TIMES ET CETERA ARE DEGRADING THEIR LEVELS OF SELF CONTROL AND THEREBY INCREASING IMPULSIVITY THE DIRECTION OF THE EFFECT IS NOT KNOWN THESE ARE PURELY CORRELATIONS NONE THE LESS THIS STUDIS AND A FEW OTHERS LIKE IT REALLY STAND AS OUR BEST EVIDENCE BELIEVE IT ORE NOT AS TO HOW ECSTASY TAKEN MANY TIMES BECAUSE AFTER ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE TAKEN ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOSES OF ECSTASY IN THEIR LIFETIME IS PRODUCING SEVERE DETRIMENTS IN COGNIVE PERFORMANCE AND THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE CASE NOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NO DATA LOOKING AT THE BRAINS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LOOKING AT FOR INSTANCE WHICH BRAINSTRUCTURES ARE ACTIVE OR LESS ACTIVE OR PERHAPS EVEN LOOKING AT LEVELS OF SAIR TONE AND OR DOPAMEAN ALL THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE WITH POSITRONOMISSION TEMOGRAPHY IMAGING FUNCTIONAL EMOR I ET CETERA HOPEULLY THOSE STUDIES WILL BE DONE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE BUT IF WE ARE WORE TO JUST TAKE A STEP BACK FROM ALL THE DATE O THE DATA IN MICE IN RATS IN NONHUMAN PRI MATES THE RETRACTION OF THE STUDY I NON HUMAN PRIMATES WHILD SHOWED THAT THE PRIMATES THAT SHOWED NER DEGENERATION WE'RE NOT GIVEN M D MA AS WAS THOUGHT BY THE RESEARCHES BUT RATHER AS LATER WAS ACKNOWLEDGED ERE ACTUALLY GIVEN METHEMPHEDEMINE AND WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE MODERATE AND HEAVY USERS OF M D MA WHO AS FAR AS WE KNOW ARE BEING HONEST AND HAVEN'T TAKEN ANY OTHER DRUGS AND WE LOOK AT THE CLINICAL STUDIES WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER TAKEN M D MA ARE GIVEN ONE OR TWO OR THREE DEFINE DOSEIS OF PURE M D MA WILL TALK BY THE STUDIES IN MOMENT THINK THE GESTALT THE TOP CONTOUR THE OVER ALL VIEW OF THOSE STUDIES IS THAT PROVIDED IT IS PURE M D M A AND PROVIDED THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT CONSUMING OTHER DRUGS WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE NEROTOXIC AND PROVIDED THAT IT'S BEING DONE IN A CONTROLLED CLINICAL SETTING THE RISK FOR TOXICITY SEEMS QUITE A BIT LOWER THEN THE POPULAR PRESS HAS PROMOTED AND YET THERE IS STILL THE RISK OF NEROTOXICITY OF PEOPLE ARE TAKING HYDOSES OF M D MA OR TAKING IT VERY FREQUENTLY OR CERTAINLY IF THEY ARE TAKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER DRUGS OR WHERE I SHOULD SAY END OR TAKING M D M IN SETTINGS THAT CAN PROMOTE NEROTOXICITY AND THE SETTINGS A'M REFERRING TO ARE ANY SETTINGS IN WHICH BLOOD PRESSURE OR BODY TEMPERATURE HAVE THE PROPENSITY TO BE GREATLY INCREASED EVERY STUDY IN MICE IN NON HUMAN PRIMATES AND IN HUMANS IN WHICH M D MA IS ADMINISTERED HAS OBSERVED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEARTRATE M D MA IS AFTER ALL A PSYCO STIMULANT IT'S A SYMPATHEMEMETIC TALKED ABYUT SYMPATHEMEMETICS AND WHAT THAT MEANS THE EPISODE ON ATERALL AN VIVE ANTS AND EIGHTY H CT BUT BASELY ITS RAMPING UP THE ACTIVITY OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS OR FIHTER FLIGHT SYSTEM E THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WHO TAKE THESE DRUGS GET BIG PUPILS YOU KNOW BE PEOPILS OF THE EYES IS WHY THEY FEEL AGITATE THEY WANT A TALK A LOT IY YOU LIKE THEY WANT A MOVE AL LOT THIS WHY F YOU'LL TAKE IT T DANCE AT RAVES AT CETERA BUT WHEN PEOPLE TAKE SOME PATHEMEMETICS WITHARNOTS EMD  MA OR IMPHEDIMINE OR COCANE OR EVEN KAFFINE THERE'S AN INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEARTRATE BUT ALSO BODY TEMPERATURE AND IF THAT'S DONE IN AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THERE'S VERY LITTLE TEMPERATURE REGULATION SO PEOPLE AREN'T FOR INSTANCE DRINKING ENOUGH FLUIDS AND ELECTROLITES STHRA HOT IN THE ROOM YOU CAN GET NEUROTOXICITY BASED ON TEMPERATURE EFFACTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE SERTONAN AND DOPOMEAN ALSO ACT ON THE SO CALLED MEDIAL PREOPTICARY O THE HYPOTHALMUS WHICH IS INVOLVED IN TEMPERTURE REGULATION IF YOUR CURIOUS ABOUT TEMPERATURE REGULATION COVERED A LOT OF THAT IN THE EPISODE O THE HEBRUN LAPACAS ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND DELIBERT HEAT EXPOSURE THIS IS AN ARYI USED TO WORK ON MANY YEARS AGO AS A RESEARCH SCIENTISTS BEFORE MOVING ON TO OTHER TOPICS TO RESEARCH IN MY LABORATORY BIG INCREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE ARE NOT GOOD THE BODY AND IN PARTICULAR YOUR BRAIN CAN TOLERATE DECREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE THAT ARE PRETTY ROBOST AND YOU CAN STILL STAY SAFE YOUARE NOT IN A KILL NIRONS BUT EVEN AN INCREASE OF THREE OR FOUR DEGREES IN BODY TEMPERATURE CAN START TO KILL OFF NURONS SO WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL NAUROTOXICITY OF M D  MA THE CONDITIONS THAT IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THE BEHAVIORAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SOMEBODY TAKES MD  MA ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT AT LEAST IMPORTANT I WOULD ARGUE AS ANY OTHER COMPOUNDS THEY MIGHT BE INJESTING WITH M D  MA SO THAT'S SOMETHING REALLY SERIOUS TO CONSIDER SO IF SOMEBODY SAYS EMDIA MATE PUTS HOLES IN YOUR BRAIN YOU WOULD BE CORRECT IN BEING SCEPTICAL OR AT LEAST GIVING THEM SOME COUNTER ARGUMENTS FOR THAT STATEMENT BUT IF SOMEBODY SAYS MD  MA IS NOT TOXIC WITHIN YOU WOULD BE EQUALLY VALID IN SAYING AH WAIT BUT WE NEED TO THING ABOUT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH MD MA IS BEING TAKEN IS IT PURE M D ME OR IS IT MOSTLY MATHEMPHEDEMINE IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD BE VERY TOXIC IS IT M D MA ALONE OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH KAFFINE WITHIN THAT SAME TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD IS IT M D MA WHILE MOVING AROUND A LOT OR BEING OUTDOORS OR BEING IN A ENVIRONMENT ERHAPS A RAVE OR DANCE TYPE ENVIRONMENT WHERE TEMPERATURE IS GOING UP WILL IN THAT CASE IT CULD BE VERY NERRO TOXIC SO FARM ACOLEGY OF M D M A COUNTS BUT SO DOES POLYPHARM ACOLOGY THE INGESTION OF OTHER COMPOUNDS NOT JUST DURING THE M D M A SESSION BUT ALSO IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE AND AFTER THAT M  M A SESSION AND BEHAVIORS WILL CERTAINLY IMPACT TEMPERATURE WHICH WILL IMPACT WHETHER NOT M D MA IS NOR ATOXIC OR NOT AND DESPITE MY EFFORTS I COULDN'T FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THE ELD S COMMUNITY HAS OFFICIALLY SANCTION THE USE OF M D M A CERTAINLY THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY BUT I HAVE NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT OR RATHER WHETHER R NOT CERTAIN PEOPLE WITHIN THE ELD S COMMUNITY HAVE ALLOWED THEMSELVES GIVE THEMSELVES PERMISSION TO USE M D M A AND THEY ARE NOT USING OTHER DRUGS WHAT I DO UNDERSTAND TO BE THE CASE IS THAT PEOPLE WITHIN THE EL D S COMMUNITY ARE DISCOURAGED FROM USING DRUGS LIKE CAFINE OR COCANE OR ALCOHOL AND THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION OF PEOPLE THAT WAS EXPLORED IN THIS STUDY SELF IDENTIFY AS ELD S ND SELF IDENTIFY AS HAVING TAKEN M D M A ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES BUT WHERE THEY GOT PERMISSION FOR THAT WHETHER NOT AS FROM SOME ONE ELSE OR FROM THEMSELVES I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT WITHIN THE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF THE PAPER THERE'S ACTUALLY A THANK YOU TO THE PERSON THAT IDENTIFIED THIS QUO UNIQUE POPULATION FOR OUR STUDY SO I WELCOME YOU TO I TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPER AND IF ANY OF YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT IF IND HOW A PARTICULAR SUB GROUP WITHIN THE EL D S COMMUNITY IS ALLOWED TO TAKE M D M A PERHAPS YOU WANT TO PUT THOSE IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOU TWO BEFORE MOVING TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT M D M A IS DOING AND THE EFFECTS THAT PEOPLE ARE SEEING IN THE CLINICAL STUDIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF P T S T WHICH BY THE WAY ARE EXTREMELY EXCITING CAN'T WE TO SHARE THESE DATO WITH YOU I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING THAT ANY ONE WHOSE HEARD ABOUT M D M A OR PERHAPS USED M D MA IS FAMILIAR WITH AND THAT'S THE SO CALLED CRASH THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AFTER M D MA THEREARE A LOT OF MYTHS ABOUT THE POST M D MA CRASH AND THERE'S A LOT OF LOERE OUT THERE ON THE INTERNETE ABOUT HOW TO OFFSET THE CRASH AND A LOT OF LORE ABOUT HOW TO PREVENT THE POTENTIAL NAUROTOXICITY OF M D MA EARLIERE WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE MAJOR POINTS AROUND OFFSETTING NEUROTOXICITY SO CERTAINLY MAKING SURE THAT ANY M D MA THAT ONE TAKES AS IN THE LEGAL CLINICAL SETTING THAT IT'S THEREFORE PURE M D MA RIGHT THAT IT'S NOT CUT WITH OTHER THINGS WHICH CERTAINLY CAN INCREASE TOXICITY CONTROLLING THE TEMPERATURE OF ONE'S ENVIRONMENT RESTRICTING KAFFININ TAKE AT LEAST ON THE DAY OF M D MA INGESTION BUT CERTAINLY THE DAY BEFORE IN THE DAY AFTER WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS WELL SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT KAFFINE AN ACTIVATION OF THE DENIZINE RECEPTOR AS WELL AS CAFFINES EFFECTS ON DOPOMI RECEPTORS CAN INTERACT WITH THE POTENTIAL AGAIN POTENTIAL NUROTOXICITY OF M D MA BUT THE CRASH THAT ONE EXPERIENCES AFTER M D MA IS ACTUALLY A PHENOMENON VERY COMMON TO THE CRASH THAT ONE EXPERIENCES AFTER INGESTION OF ANY TYPE OF STIMULANT COCANE INPEDAMINE ET CETERA AND THE CRASH THAT WERE REFERRING TO IS A DROP IN MOOD INCREASE IN LETHARGY OF A FEELINGS OF LACK OF MOTIVATION MANY PEOPLE HAVE WRONGLY ASSUMED THAT THE CRASH WAS DUE TO QUOE QUO DEPLETION OF SERATONAN OR DEPLETION OF DOPOMINE OR MAYBE EVEN DEATH OF SERTONURGI AN DOPOMINURGIC NURONS AND WHILE CERTAINLY THAT COULD BE THE CASE IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE IN THE IMMEDIATE TWENTY FORE OR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER M D MA INGESTION THAT SAID YOU WILL SEE PROTOCOLS THAT PEOPLE PUT OUT ON THE INTERNETE SUCH AS OH YOU KNOW AFTER TAKING M D MA SHOULD TAKE A BUNCH OF YOU KNOW FIVE H T P OR OTHER PRECURSORS TO CERATONAN OR DOPOMINE WHICH COME IN AMENOACID FORM SO ELTRIPDIFAN FOR INSTANCE IS THE M MINO ACID PRECURSER TO SERATONIN ITS IN THE RATONAN SYNTHESIS PATHWAY YOU'LL HEAR THAT PEOPLE WILL TAKE ELTYRICINE WHICH IS THE AMENOACID PRECURSER TE DOPOMINE AS A WAY TO TRYIN BUFFER INCREASE DOPOMINE DURING THE SO CALLED PERIOD OF THE CRASH THERE'S REALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE BENEFICIAL AND THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT MIGHT BE DETROMENTAL BECAUSE IF ANYTHING TAKING ELTRIP TO FAN AND TAKING ELTYRICINE WOULD ACTUALLY FURTHER DEPLETE CERATONAN AND DOPOMINE SO THE LOGIC THERE A IS SIMPLY NOT VERY GOOD WHAT IS CLEAR HOWEVER IS THAT EMDIAMA CAN CAUSE NOT JUST PROFOUND INCREASES IN DOPOMINE CERETONEN AND OXYTOSIN BUT THAT ANY TIME THERE'S A BIG INCREASE IN DOPOMINE THERE IS GOING TO BE A POST DOPOMINERGIC INCREASE IN PROLACTIN RELEASE AND PROLACTIN IS A HORMONE SOMETIMES CONSIDERED AN NEUROHORMO BUT'S REALLY HORMONE THAT'S INVOLVED IN A LT OF THINGS MILK LET DOWN IN LACTATING WOMEN IT'S INVOLVED IN SETTING THE REFRACTORY PERIOD TO SEXUAL EROUSAL AND ERECTION AND EJACULATION IN MALS AFTER EJACULATION IT'S INVOLVED IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY INCLUDING THE LAYING DOWN O BODY FAT STORES AND IT'S ALLSO ASSOCIATE WITH INCREASES IN LETHARGY DECREASES IN DOPOMINE THIS IS WY DRUGS THAT INCREASE DOPOMINE ARE KNOWN TO DECREASE PROLACTIN AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM ON THIS IS WISE DRUGS LIKE CABERGOLINE FOR INSTANCE THAT INCREASE DOPAOMINE ARE USED AS WAYS TO SUPPRESS PROLACTIN NOW EMDIAMA INGESTION IS KNOWN TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE PROLACTIN AND PEOPLE ARE STRYING TO REALIZE THAT IT PERHAPS IS THE INCREASE IN PROLACTIN THAT OCCURS BOTH DURING AND FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THE HOURS OR DAYS AFTER INJESTION OF M D MA THAT LEADS TO AT LEAST SOME COMPONENTS OF THE SO CALLED CRASH THAT FEELING OF LETHARGY AND LACK OF MONIVATION MAY BE DIMINISHED MOOD ET CETERA AND FOR THAT REASON SOME PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO EXPLORE THE USE OF THINGS LIKE P FIV P WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A METABOLITE OF VITEMEN B SIX WHICH IS KNOWN TO SUPPRESS PROLACTON AS A WAY TO TRY AND BUFFER SOME OF THAT CRASH TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE NO HUMAN DATA YET EXPLORING THE USE OF P FIVE P OR OTHER VITEMM B SIX DERIVATIVES OR K BERGOLINE OR THINGS OF THAT SORT TO REDUCE PROLACTON IN A CONTROLLED STANDARDIZED CLINICAL TRIAL KIND OF MANNER BUT I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME OF THE CLINITIONS THAT ARE USING M D MA LEGALLY WITHIN THE CONTEXTS OF THE TREATMENT OF P T ST AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT STARTING TO RECEIVE SOME ADDITIONAL ATTENTION SO I JUST MENTION IT BRIEFLY HERE BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE TICS A LOT OF IDEAS OUT THERE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE TAKEN ALTROPTOPHEN THEY SHOULD BE TAKING ALTIRISINE THEY SHOULD BE TAKING MAGNESIUM OTHER THINGS THAT CETER AFTER TAKING M D  M IN ORDER TO RECOVER FROM THE POST M D  MAY CRASH MORE QUICKLY BUT IT'S REALLY THE INCREASE TON PROLACTON WHICH SPEAKS MOST DIRECTLY TO THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF THE SO CALLED CRASH SO BY MY READ OF THE MECHANISMS OF M D  MA THE NOR CHEMICALS IT RELEASES THE NUR HORMONES THAT IT PROMOTES THE RELEASE OF PROLACTON IN PARTICULAR THIS P FIVE P SUPPRESSION OF PROLACTON IS PERHAPS THE ONE THAT'S MOST INTRIGUING IN THAT REALLY HAS ANY KIND OF MECHANISTIC BASIS SO I PROMISE THAT GOING FORWARD AS THE SCIENTISTS INCLINITIONS THAT ARE USING M D  MA FOR THE TREATMENT OF P T ST AND OTHER CONDITIONS SUCH AS ALCALL USED DISEORDER ET CETERA START TO EXPLORE THE USE OF POST M D  MA SESTION P FIVE P AND OTHER MODES OF SUPPRESSING PROLACTON FOR THE HOURS AND DAYS AFTER M D  MA PROMISE TO UPDATE YOU ON THOSE FINDINGS THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S EPISODE I'VE BEEN REFERRING TO CLINICAL STUDIES THAT IS CLINICAL TRIALS EXPLORING THE USE OF M D  MA IN ORDER TO AUGMENT TREATMENT FOR P T ST SLAS JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND TALK ABOUT WHAT P T S T IS P T ST IS POST DRAMATIC STRESS DISORDER TROMA IS ANYTHING TH AT MONIFIES THE BRAIN TO FUNCTION LESS WELL GOING FORWARD IN A PHYSICAL TRAMA YOU CAN HAVE EMOTIONAL TRAMA TYPICALLY PT ST IS USED TO REFER TO EMOTIONAL TRAMA CAUSED BY EITHER SINGLE EVENTS YOU CAN IMAGINE I CAR ACCIDENT SEXUAL ASSAULT THESE CAN BE FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCES SO THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY THAT LEADS TO TRAMA AND THEN PETIISTY THESE CAN ALSO BE THIRD PERSON EVENTS WHERE SOME ONE OBSERVES SOMETHING THAT IS TRAMATIC TO THEM THE SOMEBODY BEING KILLED TISMEMBERED ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD BE VERY TRAMATIC IN THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM AND OF COURSE PETIASTY NEED NOT BE CAUSED ONLY BY SINGLE EVENT TRAMAS BUT BY MULTIPLE EVENT TRAMAS ENTIRE RELATIONSHIPS ENTIRE CHILDHOODS AWAR TIME EXPERIENCES COMMINATIONS OF DIFFERENT TRAMAS AND ON AND ON THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF TRAMA IF ANY OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN TRAMA AND ITS TREATMENT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BOOK TRAMA BY DOCTOR PAULCANTI HE IS AN EMTY MEDICAL DOCTOR PSYCHIATRIS HE WAS FEATURED AS A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST HE'S BEEN ON A NUMBER OF OTHER PROMINENT PODCASTS WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK IN ARE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS TO THE BOOK TRAMA I CONSIDER THAT BOOK TO BE THE BEST BOOK IN TERMS OF DESCRIBING WHAT TRAMA IS AND ISN'T AND HOW IT LEADS TO PETISTIT ALSO DESCRIBES SOME OF DOCTOR PAULCONTI'S OWN EXPERIENCES WITH TRAMA AND HIS OWN TREATMENT OF TRAMA IN HIS PATIENT POPULATION WHICH IS QUITE WIDE RANGING MEN WOMEN YOUNG PEOPLE OLDER PEOPLE AND A VARIETY OF TRAMATIC EXPERIENCES SO EXCELLENT BOOK FOR THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN TRAMA NOW THE TREATMENT OF TRAMA HAS BEEN MET WITH SOME DEGREE OF SUCCESS THROUGH QUALITY TOCTHERAPE LET'S DEFINE QUALITY TOCTHERAPY IN THE WAY THAT DOCTOR PALCANTI DID ON THIS EPISODE THAT'S TALCTHERAPE FOR WHICH THE PATIENT SOMETIMES REFER TO AS THE CLIENT BUT MORE TRADITIONALLY REFER TO AS THE PATIENT AND THE THERAPISTS OR A PSYCHOLOGISTS OR PSYCHIATRIST HAS GOOD REPORT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT REPORT THERE IS THE FEELING OF SUPPORT THAT THERE IS A SAFE PLACE IN WHICH TO EXPLORE THE TRAMA AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ONE'S CURRENT LIFE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT TRAMA IS FITTING IN TO ADAPTIVE AND MALADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS AND EMOTIONAL STATES NOW IN ADDITION TO REPORT AND SUPPORT BEING CRITICAL THERE'S A THIRD COMPONENT OF EFFECTIVE TALK THERAPE POR TRAMA WHICH IS INSIGHT WHERE ONE'S ABILITY TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY ONE FEELS THE WAY THEY DO AND TO LINK THAT TO SOME LARGER CONTEXT THAT BRINGS ABOUT SOME DEGREE OF RELIEF AND THAT SQUARE THINGS START TO GET A LITTLE BIT ABSTRACT AND THAT'S ALSO WHERE WE START TO SEE THAT WHILE TROMATHERAPE IN THE FORM OF TALK THERAPE CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE ABOUT HALF OF PEOPLE THAT UNDERGO TALK THERAPE AND TALK THERAPE ALONE FOR THE TREATMEN OF PT ST ACHIEVE NO LONG LASTING RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS AND AN EVEN SMALLER NUMBER OF THEM UNDERGO COMPLETE REMITTANCE OF THEIR PTIEST OCASO THEIR SYMPTOMS CAN LESSON THEY CAN GET SOME IMPROVEMENT BUT THAT IMPROVEMENT IS OFTEN SLIGHT OR IS TRANSIENT AND FOR THOSE THAT DO ACHIEVE RELIEF IT'S OFTEN NOT COMPLETE REMISSION OF THE PTSTI ITSELF NOW IN ADDITION TO TALK THERAPE FOR PT ST THERE IS OF COURSE PRESCRIPTION DRUG THERAPIES AND MOST OFTEN THESE FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF ECESSORISE SELECTIVE CERATONE AND REUPTAKEN HIBITORS AND IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT ECESSARISE CAN BE IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES EFFECTIVE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT STI IT HAS BEEN SHOWN FOR INCES THAT AS MANY AS FORTY MAY BE AS MANY AS SIXTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE ESESSORISE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT ST GET SOME SYMPTOM RELIEF NOW THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT ESCESSORISE DON'T HAVE SIDE EFFECTS THEY CAN HAVE SIDE FFECTS SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THESE SIE EFFECTS THINGS LIK BLUNTING OF LEBIDO BLUNTING OF APPETITE OR INCREASES AN APPETITE IN SOME CASES DESRUPTION OF SLEEP WAKE RHYTHMS MOTIVATION ET CETERA SO THERE'S OFTEN AN EXPLORATION FOR THE SO CALL MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSE THAT PROVIDES SOME SYMPTOM RELIEF TO PTI ST BUT THAT DOESN'T INTRODUCE UNWONTED SIDE EFFECTS AND OF COURSE THERE'S A THIRD SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE TAKING ECCESSORISE EN DOING TALK THER PE RPTSTI AND WHAT'S VERY CLEAR IS THAT ANY TIME YOU ADD QUALITY TALK THERAP TO A DRUG TREATMENT YOUARE GOING TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES FOR THAT DRUG TREATMENT THE REVERSE IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT ADDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG TREATMENT TO TALK THERAPE IMPROVES OUTCOMES FOR TALK THERABE ALTHOUGH THAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN A NUMBER OF STUDIES NOW THE WHOLE IDEA OF EXPLORING THE USE OF M D MA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTSTI STEMD FROM THE FACT THAT EVEN IN PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING QUALITY TALK THERAPEAN GAN WE CAN DEFINE QUALITY TALK THERAPE IS GOOD REPORT BETWEEN PATIENT AND CLINITION AS WELL AS FEELINGS OF SUPPORT AS WELL AS POTENTIAL INSIGHT AND EVEN WHEN ESCESSORISE ARE COMBINED WITH THAT QUALITY TALK THERAPE THERE STILL A LARGE NUMBER PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY DO NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT OR LONG LASTING RELIEF FROM THEIR PTISTI AND AN EINFEWER NUMBER WHO GO INTO FULL REMITTANCE OF THEIRPTI ST THAT IS DESPITE BEING DILIGENT AND HARD WORKING IN THEIR TALC THERAPE DESPITE THE THERAPISTS BEING VERY COMMITTED DESPITE THE USE OF ECESSORISE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT TAL THERAPE THOSE PEOPLE OFTEN STILL QUALIFIES HAVING PTIASTI THE GOAL OF COURSE IS FOR SOMEBODY TO RECEIVE TREATMENT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO NO LONGER MEET THE CRITERIA FOR HAVING PTIST NOTCIOUS IN TERMS OF A CLINICAL AVALUATION BUT THAT THEY THEMSELVES REPORT FEELING MUCH BETTER NOT FEELING OVERWHELMED WITH THE SYMPTOMOLOGY OF PTI ST NOW THE SYMPTOMOLOGY FOR PTI ASTI IS VAST AND IT'S FAR TOO VAST TO GO INTO INA LOT OF DETAIL RIGHT NOW ITHINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STEREOTYPED EXAMPLE OF PETI ASTI THIS IS THE SOLDIER THAT COMES BACK FROM OVERSEES THAT  HAS BEEN IN GUN FIGHTS OR IN BATTLES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AS LIKELY SEEN CASUALTIES AND SEVERE INJURIES AND THAT UPON RETURN TO A SAFE ENVIRONMENT IS STILL EXPERIENCING A LOT OF ANXIETY AND SOMETIMES PANIC ATTACKS THAT OCCUR SEEMINGLY AT RANDOMER THAT CAN BE SPARKED BY UN O THER CLASSIC TERATYPED EXAMPLE AS YOU KNOW A CARBACK FIRES AND THEN THE PERSON SUDDENLY FEELS AS IF THEIR BACK IN BATTLE THAT SORT OF THING DOES HAPPEN CERTAINLY BUT THERE ARE A WHOLE OTHER CATEGORY OF SYMPTOMS OF PT ST WHICH INCLUDE DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS OF PT ST PEOPLE WHO HAVE PT ST FROM VERY INTENSELY DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES THAT A ARE CHECKED OUT THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN ENGAGE THEY HAVE BRAIN FOG THEY A ARE DISTRACTED AE THEY GO FROM FEELING ANXIOUS TO FEELING EXHAUSTED THE AV SLEEP ISSUES NOT SURPRISINGLY THEN PEOPLE WITH PT ST OF EITHER THE DISSOCIATIVE TYPE OR OTHER SYMPTOMOLOGY OF PT ST AND KEEP IN MIND THAT ONE CAN HAVE BOTH DISSOCIATIVE AND NON DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS OF PT ST SUCH AS ANXIETY IN PANIC ARE AT A FAR GREATER RISK OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SO THE CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT PEOPLE WITH PT ST NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF PT ST DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS OR ERE OTHERWISE UNA PANIC ATTACKS AR BOTH ARE AT A MUCH GREATER RISK OF HAVING A DICTIONS TO EITHER ELICIT DRUGS OR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR BOTH SO THINGS LIKE ALCOHOL USE DISORDER IS VERY COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH PT ST OPIOID USED DISORDER IS VERY COMMON STIMULANT USE DISORDER AND ON AND ON SO PEOPLE WITH PT ST SUFFER AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THERE ARE ALL THESE WHAT ARE CALLED COMORBIDITIES WITH PT ST INCLUDING A DICTION BUT ALSO DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND SO YOU CONSTRUCT TO SEE O PT ST SETS UP A WHOLE CASCADE IV THINGS THAT MAKE LIVING LIFE EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC AT THE LEVEL OF BASIC RELATIONSHIPS FUNCTIONING IN THE WORK PLACE AND EVEN WHEN MENTAL HEALTH APPEARS TO B IN CHECK OFTENTIMES PEOPLE ARE HOLDING A LOT IN SO THEY HAVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND CEREVRAL VASCULAR DEFISITS THAT CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THEIR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM PHYSICAL HEALTH SO PETIESTI IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE THE CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT AS MANY AS EIGHT PER CENT OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE PETIESTI AND AGAIN THE ESTIMATES AROUND COMORBIDITIES RANGE ANYWHERE FROM YO SEVENTEEN TO FORTY SIX ARE AS HIGH AS SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE WITH PETESTI HAVING COMORBIDITIES FOR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND A DICTION IN PARTICULAR SO FINDING LASTING RELIEF TO PETIEST IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND MADE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BY THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH PETIESTI SADLY AND OF COMMITTING SUICIDES A SUICIDE RATES ARE FAR GREATER IN PEOPLE WITH PETIESTI THE EXACT RATES OF INCREASE AND SUICIDALITY IN PEOPLE WITH PTIESTI ARE LOW BIT HARD TO ARRIVE AT IN THE STATISTICS BECAUSE OF ALL THE COMORBIDITIES BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT SUICIDE IS FAR MORE LIKELY IN PEOPLE WITH PETIESTI ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT PETIESTI BRINGS ABOUT NOW PETESTI CREATES ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT IT DOES LARGELY THROUGH CHANGES IN BRAIN CIRCUITRY AS WELL AS NERL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND BODY MANY PEOPLE A PERHAPS HEARD OF THE BOOK THE BODY KEEPS THE SCORE WHICH IS A A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND POPULAR BOOK ABOUT THE IDEA THAT TRAMA CAN BE QUEN STORED IN THE BODY TO BE CLEAR TRAMAS CANT ACTUALLY BE STORED IN THE BODY YOU DON'T ACTALLY STORE MEMORIES IN THE BODY WHAT YOU STORE ARE ACTIVATION OF NERL CIRCUITS THAT INCLUDE BRAIN AND BODY AND THEY ALL SEEM TO CENTERE BACK INTO THE INSOLA THAT STRUCTURE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS STRUCTURE IN OUR BRAIN THAT HAS A MAP OF OUR BODYS SURFACE SO CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF WE DON'T STORE MEMORIES IN THE BODY OR TRAMA AN THE BODY IN A WAY THAT FOR INSTANCE YET WORKING OUT A KNOT OR OF PAIN IN ONE'S LOWER BACK WILL RELIEVE THE TRAMA IT SOMETIMES CAN ACTIVATE A MEMORY OF THE TRAMA BUT WHEN ONE IS DOING THAT WHAT YOU ARE REALLY DOING IS ACTIVATING NERL CIRCUITS THAT RESIDE WITHIN THE BRAIN WITHIN THE INSULA THAT CORRESPOND TO SENSATIONS WITHIN THE BODY NOW I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE ROLE OF THE BODY IN THE FORMATION AN THE PERSISTENCE OF PT ST AND I CERTAINLY THINK THE BOOK THE BODY KEEPS THE SCORE IS A PIONEERING BOOK ITS IN FACT AN IMPORTANT BOOK BUT I ONT T EMPHASIZE THAT THE MODERN ORR SCIENCE REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT PT ST IS CAUSED BY THE EXACT SORTS OF BRAIN NETWORK ACTIVATIONS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER THINGS LIKE HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF ACTIVATION IN THE EMIGDULA TO INSLA PATHWAY WHICH OF COURSE WOULD EXACERBATE BODILY SENSATIONS RELATED TO THE TRAMA OR HEIGHTENED ACTIVATION OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS THIS MEMORY CENTER IN THE BRAIN TO A MIGDULA TO INSUL CIRCUITRY NOW THEREFORE IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT IF M D MA CAN REDUCE THE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE HIPPOCAMPEL TO A MIGDULA TO INSULA CIRCUITRY AND CAN DO SO BOTH WHILE SOMEONE IS UNDER THE EFFECTS OF M D MA BUT THEN LEAD TO PERSISTENT LONG LASTING REDUCTIONS IN THE ACTIVATION OF THOSE BRAIN NETWORKS ERL THEN IT STANDS TO REASON THAT M D MA COULD BE A VALID THERAPUTIC FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT ST AND OF COURSE THIS HAS BEEN EXPLORED AND HERE WE CAN REALLY GIVE A NOD AND LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO THE SO CALLED MAPS GROUP THE MAPS GROUP IS A GROUP THAT'S OPERATING MAINLY OUT OF SANTICRUS CALIFORNIA BUT THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SATELITE LABORATORIES AND CLINICAL GROUPS BOTH IN THE US IN CANADA AND ABROAD WHERE THEYV WORKED WITH GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS TO GET LEGAL AUTHORIZATION TO GIVE M D M TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE PT ST TO ALSO GIVE THEM TALK THERAPY AND THEN TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF TALK THERAPY WITH M D MA TO TALK THERAPE WITH PLACIBO ALONE AND THERE ARE ABOUT THREE TO FIVE STUDIES IN THIS AREA NOW THAT STAND AS LARGE SCALE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT ARE SHOWING WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS REMARKABLE RESULTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT ST SO RATHER THAN GOING TO ANY ONE OF THOSE STUDIES IN IMMENSE DETAIL I'M GOING TO SUMMARISE ACROSS THOSE STUDIES I WILL PROVIDE LYNX TO THOSE IN THE SHONOTE CAPTIONS  TWO THAT I THINK ARE MOST INTERESTING OR THE STUDY ENTITLED M D A MA ASSISTED THERAPE FOR SEVERAPTST ERANDOMIZE DOUBLE BLIND PLACIBAL CONTROLED FACE THREE STUDY AS WELL AS THE STUDY ENTITLED THE EFFECTS OF MD A MA ASSISTED THERAPE ON ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE USE IN EFFACE THREE TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVEROP T ST SO AS THE TITLE SUGGEST BOTH CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVE GIVING PEOPLE TALK THERAP AN M D  MA OR TALK THERAP AND PLACIBO TALK ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THAT WAS DONE IN A MOMENT AND THEN TO LOOK AT RELIEF OF PTST SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO RELIEF OF SOME OF THE ADDICTIVE SYMPTOMS THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH PTST SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THESE TRIALS AND WHY THEIR SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AND WHY WE REALLY ARE ON THE COSP OF LEGALIZATION OF M D MA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTST IN THE SORTS OF CLINICAL CONTECTS I DESCRIBED WHEN PEOPLE ARE GIVEN JUST TALK THERAPE ALONE OR TALK THERAPE WITH ESSESSORISE THEY WILL OFTEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN THEIR SEVERITY OF PTST SYMPTOMS AND RARELY THEY WILL EXPERIENCE COMPLETE REMITTANCE OF THEIR PT ST THAT IS THEY WILL NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR PTST AFTER RECEIVING A NUMBER OF TALK THERAPECESSIONS SO LET'S COMPARE THAT TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE DO TALK THERAPE IN CONJUNCTION WITH M D MA AND I'LL EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS IN A MOMENT BUT IT ESSENTIALLY MEANS TAKING M D MA WHILE DOING TALK THERAPE HOWEVER THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT HOWEVER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING M D MA IN THESE TRIALS HAVE ALREADY DONE TALK THERAPE WITHOUT M D MA THEN THEY'RE DOING TALK THERAPE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M D  M AND THEN THEY ARE DOING SESSIONS OF TALK THERAPE NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M D  MA AND THE ENTIRE TIME THEY'REDOING THAT WITH THE SAME TO THERAPUS OK IN THE PLACIBO GROUP PEOPLE ARE DOING TALK THERAPE WITH TO THERAPIS BUT THEY'RE NOT TAKING M D  MA OCASLO DOING THE SAME NUMBER THERAPROCESSIONS BUT THEI'RE NOT TAKING M MA SO TO JUST GET TO THE KEEN NUMBERS FIRST THE OVERALL RATE FOR CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO M D MA ASSISTED THERAPY IS EIGHTY EIGHT PER CENT THAT'S WHAT EMERGING FROM THESE TRIALS VERSES SIXTY PER CENT FOR THE PLUCIBO AND THERAPE ALONE SO ON THE FACE OF IT YOU MIGHT SAY O KE WAW EIGHTY EIGHT PER CENT OF PEOPLE WHO DO TALK THERAPY AND HERE I MIGH S WELL JUST FINALLY EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS DONE PATIENTS ARE SELECTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE PETIISTI THEY MEET THE CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR PETISTI THEY DO THREE NINETY MENUTE THERAPY SESSIONS WITH TWO THERAPUS TALKING ABOUT THEIR PTIISTI SYMPTOMS TALKING ABOUT TO THEXTENT THAT THEY CAN THE INCIDENT OR INCIDENTS THE LIFE EVENTS THAT LED TO THAT PETIISTI NONE OF THAT IS DONE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANY DRUG IT SO EVERY ONE IN THE EXPERMENT DOES THAT THEN THE GROUP DIVIDES INTO TWO WHERE HALF ARE TAKING M D MA THEY TAKE THAT THREE TIMES DURING THOSE THREE TIMES THEY ARE ALSO RECEIVING THERAPY SESSIONS WITH THE SAME THERAPUS THAT THEY WERE WORKING WITH BEFORE THEY TOOK M D MA THE FIRST SESSION THEY RE TAKING EIGHTY MILIGRAMS OF M D MA AND THEN A FORTY MILIGRAM BOOSTER ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF TO TWO HOURS IN THE SECOND SESSION THEY ARE TAKING A HIRE DOSE OF M  MA IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY MILIGRAMS AND THEN IF THEY ELECT TO THEY CAN TAKE A SIXTY MILIGRAM BOOSTER ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF TO TWO HOURS INTO THE SESSION AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD CESSION WHERE THEY TAKE AGAIN A HUNDRED TWENTY MILIGRAMS OF M D MA AND HAVE THE OPTION TO TAKE A SIXTY MILIGRAM BOOSTER AT AN HOUR ANDA HALF TO TWO HOURS INTO THE SESSION AGAIN ANY TIME THE'RE ON M D MA THEY HAVE THERAPIS THERE THAT THER TALKING TO ABOUT THEIR TRAMA THEY ARE EI THEIR SPENDING TIME WITH TEIR EYES CLOSE LYING DOWN SOMETIMES IN ANI MASK AND THINKING ABOUT THE TRAMA THINKING ABOUT THEIR CURRENT STATE IN EXPERIENCE ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THAN THEIR EXITING THE E MASK OR TALKING TO THE THERAPISTS THE THERAPUSES TAKING NOTES ASKING QUESTIONS REMEMBER THEY'VE ESTABLISHED A STRONG REPOR SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE THERAPISTS PRIOR TO TAKING M D ME IN THE THERAPY SESSION AND THEN THEY ALSO UNDERGO THREE NINETY MINUTE THERAPE SESSIONS WITH THE TWO THERAPISTS SPACE ONE WEEK APART AFTER THE FINAL M D ME SESSION NOW THOSE THAT WERE PLACED INTO THE PLACIBO CONDITION DO EVERYTHING EXACTLY THE SAME AS I JUST DESCRIBED SO THREE NINETY MINUTE SESSIONS AS PREP THAN THREE EIGHT HOUR SESSIONS WITH THOSE TWO THERAPISTS AND THEN THREE NINETY MINUTE FOLLOW UPSESSIONS ONE WEK APART BUT THEY TAKE A PLACIBO NOT M D ME SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THESE SO CALLED MAPS STUDIES THESE CLINICAL TRIALS FOR PTISTI THE CONDITIONS ARE VERY SIMILAR EXCEPT FOR THE INCLUSION OF THE DRUG M D M SO THOSE RATES OF SUCCESS WITH TALK THERAPEAN M D ME AGAIN OVER ALL RATE FOR CLINKLY EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO MDI MA ASSISTED THERAPE WAS EIGHTY EIGHT PER CENT COMPARED TO SIXTY PER CENT FOR THERAPI AND PLACIBO WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE HOWEVER IS THAT SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE M D ME PLUSTHERAPE TREATMENT GROUP NO LONGER MET THE CRITERIA FOR PTSTI BY THE END OF THE TREATMENT SO IN OTHER WORDS THEIR PTSTI WENT INTO REMITTANS WE COULD SAY THEY ARE QUITINQCURED BUT TYPICALLY A FOR THINGS LIKE PTIST THAT'S NOT THE LANGUAGE THAT SUSED RATHER WHAT'S USED IS STATISTICAL VALUATION OF HOW THE DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS LIKE DISSOCIATION OR ANXIETY OR SLEEP DISORDERS ARE EXPLORED SO WHILE TO SOME OF YOU A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIXTY PER CENT SUCCESS WITH TALK THERPE PLUSIBO VERSES EIGHTY EIGHT PER CENT SUCCESS WITH TALK THERAPE PLUS M D MA MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE THAT BIG OF A DIFFERENCE IT IS INDEED QUITE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE IN FACT TO M I KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO OTHER EXAMPLE OF A TREATMENT FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER THAT IS SUCCESSFUL TO THE SAME MAGNITUDE I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THAT I'M SURE SOME PSYCHATRICS OUT THERE GAIN A JUMP ON ME ABOUT THIS AND PLEASE DO I WOULD INCOURAGE YOU IF YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY THERAP PLUS DRUG TREATMENT THAT IS EFFECTIVE AT RATES OF GREATER THAN EIGHTY EIGHT PER CENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF A MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER PLEASE DO PUT THAT INFORMATION IN THE COMMENTS ON UTUBAN PERHAPS A REFERENCE TO A STUDY WOULD BE EVEN BETTER BUT EVEN IF NOT JUST PUT A REFERENCE TO THAT THERE WULD BE GREAT FOR SAKE OF FUTURE EPISODES ET CETERA BUT NONE THE LESS AN EIGHTY EIGHT PER CENT SUCCESSORATE AND HERE I AM REFERRING TO SUCCESSORY AS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CLINICAL SYMPTOMS FOR PT ST AND SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THOSE PEOPLE GOING TO FULL REMITTENCE FOR PT ST BY THE END OF THE TREATMENT IS PRETTY SPECTACULAR WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE HEARING SO MUCH THESE DAYS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL TRANSITION OF MDI MA FROM A SCHEDUAL ONE DRUG FOR WHICH THERE CUNOQOTE NO CLINICAL APPLICATIONS TO POTENTIALLY A LEGAL WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CLINICAL USE APPLICATION OF M D MA WHICH IT DOES APPEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS AT LEAST CONSIDERING FOR AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MAY BE EVEN LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN NOW A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT RESULTS HAVE EMERGED FROM THIS AND OTHER CLINICAL TRIALS FOR INSTANCE REMEMBER EARLIER I TALKED ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WITH PT ST ALSO SUFFER FROM ALCOHOL USED DISORDER WHITHS INTERESTING IS THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE MDIM A PLUS TAL THERAPE GROUP IN THIS ANOTHER STUDIES WHO ALSO HAD PATTERNS OF ALCOHOL USED DISORDER AND EVEN SOME OTHER SUBSTANCE USED DISORDERS THE MDIM A PLUS TALK THERAPE TREATMENT IN MANY CASES RESOLVED THEIR EDICTION TO ALCOHOL OR OTHER SOMSYMPTOMS DISWELL AND PERHAPS THAT SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISING IF WE THINK ABOUT THE EDICTIONS AS STEMMING DIRECTLY FROM THEIR PT ST BUT IT IS SURPRISE ING IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT ALCOL USED DISORDER AND SOME OTHER EDICTIVE DISORDERS OFTENTIMES WILL STEM FROM DESTRUPTIONS IN NEURAL CIRCUITRY THAT ARE THE SAME DESRUPTIONS AN NERAL CIRCUITRY THAT OCCUR IN PT ST BUT OFTEN ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF ENTIRELY OTHER BRAIN WIRING PHENOMENON WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THAT JUST BECAUSE A DICTION IN PT ST ARE OFTEN CORMORBID WITH ONE AND ANOTHER IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THAT TREATING AND RESOLVING PT ST WOULD RESOLVE THE ALCOHOL OR SUBSTANCE OF BUSE DISORDER AND YET THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE OFTEN NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN IN THESE SUCCESSFUL TREATMENTS OF PT ST SO THAT'S VERY EXCITING SOME OF THE OTHER PARTICULARLY EXCITING RESULTS FROM THESE CLINICAL TRIALS ON M D  MA PLUS TALK THERAPE IS THAT THE DISSOCIATIVE FORM OF PT ST HAS TRADITIONALLY PROVED TO BE ESPECIALLY HARD TO TREAT AND THAT'S THOUGHT TO STEM FROM THE FACT THAT SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OF P T ST WHETHER NOTS BY TALK THERAPY OR TALK THERPE COMBINED WITH ASSESSORISE OR TALK THERE BE COMBINED WITH ANY DRUG TREATMENT OR BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT LIKE E M D R I MOVEMENT TO SENSES ATIAN REPROGRAMMING OR OTHER FORMS OF TREATMENTS THAT ARE DESINED TO REWIRE NERAL CIRCUITRY ALMOST ALWAYS INVOLVE THE PATIENT GETTING VERY CLOSE TO OR AT LEAST REPORTING THE TRAMATIC EXPERIENCES IN A LOT OF DETAIL AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY FOR SOMEBODY WHOS DISSOCIATING FROM THAT VERY EXPERIENCE WHOSE QUITIC CHECKED OUT AND CAN'T REALLY SEEM TO ACCESS THE EMOTIONAL STATES AND THE MEMORIES BECAUSE THEY'RE BLOCKED OFF FROM THEM OR BECAUSE THEIR UNWILLING TO ACCESS THOSE MEMORIES AND REALLY THINK ABOUT THE FULL EMOTIONAL CAPACITY OF THOSE MEMORIES THAT IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY HARD TO BRING THEM THROUGH ANY KIND OF TREATMENT FOR PT ST SO IT APPEARS THAT M D M A IN PROVIDING THIS PRO SOCIAL IN PATHIC AGAIN IN PATHIC FOR OTHERS AND IMPATHIC FOR SELF CHEMICAL AND AN MENTAL ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OF TOO TRUSTED THERAPIS WHICH ONE HAS A REALLY GOOD REPORT ALLOWS S PATIENCE WITH PITIESTI TO REALLY GET CLOSE TO THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT WERE TRAMATIC TO TALK ABOUT THEM AND TO THINK ABOUT THEM AND IN MANY WAYS TO REFRAME THEM IN A CONTACT THAT OFTEN INVOLVES AMPATHY FOR OTHERS AN EMPATHY FORSELF NOW HERE WE'RE NOT NESURELY TALKING ABOUT FORGIVENESS OF PERPETRATORS ALTHOUGH THAT SOMETIMES THE CASE THAT PEOPLE WILL FORGIVE THE PERSON THAT INFLICTED THE TRAMA ON THEM BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S ABOUT TYING THEIR FEELINGS OF TRAMA AND THEIR FEELINGS OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY DISSOCIATION ET CETERA TO SOME SORT OF LARGER CONTECTS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THE ROLL OF AGENCY TO BE IN THE ROLL OF KNOWING THAT YES THESE THINGS HAPPENED AND YET BY GETTING CLOSE TO THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF THOSE THINGS AND REALLY BEING IN MANY WAYS UNAFRAID TO GET CLOSE TO THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF THAT AND HAVING SUPPORT AROUND THAT THAT THE EMOTIONAL LOAD SEEMS DIMINISHED AND THAT THEY EXPERIENCE THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF THOSE EXPERIENCES AS DIMINISH BOTH WITHIN THE EMDAMA TREATMENT SESSION AND AFTERWARDS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO ESSENTILLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE PEOPLE FEEL THAT WHAT ONCE BURDEN THEM THEY CAN STILL REMEMBER BUT IT NO LONGER BURDENS THEM IT NO LONGER FEELS LIKE ITS IN THEIR BODY AND IN THEIR MIND OR ON LOOP OR ON REPEAT IN A WAY THAT'S INVASIVE IN A WAY THAT INTERFERES WITH OTHER ASPECTS OF NORMAL FUNCTIONING SO WHEN ONE HEARS ABOUT THESE KINDS OF RESULTS AND WHEN YOU HEARE ABOUT SOME OF THE PATIENT REPORTS AND I INVITE YOU TO DO THAT YOU CAN GO TO THE MAP SIGHT WHICH BY THE WAY IS RECRUITING SUBJECTS FOR THESE CLINICAL TRIALS AND YOU'LL ALSO FIND REPORTS OF ON INDIVIDUAL WHO PARTICIPATED IN THESE CLINICAL TRIALS ANDF COURSE WE WILL PROVIDE LYNKS TO THESE INCREDIBLE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT MAPS HAS SPEARHEADED WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE COMMINATION OF EMDIAMA AND TALK THERAPY IN MANY WAYS IS NOT ABOUT THE DRUG HAVING A PARTICULAR EFFECT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE DRUG HAVING A PARTICULAR EFFECT THAT ALLOWS THE MOTIVATIONS AND N THE RESULTS OF TALK THERAPY TO REALLY BE HEIGHTENED AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY KEY POINT TO MAKE BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW WE'VE REALLY BEN TALKING ABOUT THE NEROW CHEMISTRY OF M D  MA THE POTENTIAL TOCTICITY OR LACK THEREOF OF M D M WE'VE BEN TALKING ABOUT THE BRAIN NET WORKS ET CETERA BUT WHEN ONE THINKS ABOUT THE VALID CLINICAL USE OF M D  MA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PTST ANDI SHOULD MENTION IT ALSO HAD SOME SUCCESS IN DEALING WITH NOT ONLY I'LL CALL USE DISORDERS AND OTHER USED DISORDERS ASSOCIAT WITH PTST BUT ALSO RELIEVING THE DEPRESSION ASSOCIATE WITH PT ST SO NOW M DMAS BEING EXPLORED FOR TREATMENT OF NOT JUST PT ST BUT ALSO FOR DEPRESSION FOR ALCALL USE DISORDER AND FOR EATING DISORDERS AS WELL M D A MA SEEMS TO BE A COMPOUND THAT PRODUCES THE RIGHT KIND OF SUBJECTIVE AND NEUROCHEMICAL MILIU IN THE BRAIN THAT ALLOWS THERAPY TO BE THAT MUCH MORE POTENT WITHIN THE LIMITED NUMBER OF SESSIONS AND WHEN ONE THINKS ABOUT THE COST OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO GET THERAPY OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHICH IN TH IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT EITHER BY WAY OF INSURANCE OR BY THEIR OWN FINANCES OR YOU KNOW I I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THAT THE COST OF THERAPY SHOULD BE REDUCED BECAUSE OF COURSE THERAPIS HAFTO A SURVIVE ALSO OM BUT THE IDEA HEAR IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE RELIEF FROM THEIRPTS THEIR DEPRESSION THEIR EDICTION AND TO BE ABLE TO DO SO BY HOPEFULLY PERSISTING IN THEIR THERAPY OVER WHATEVER PERIOD OF TIME IS REQUIRED BUT ALSO TO ASSUME A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH SOMEBODY ONLY HAS TEN OR FIFTEEN OR MAYBE EVEN JUST THREE OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDERGO TREATMENT FOR PTST AND NONE THE LESS IS ABLE TO ACHIEVE TREMENDOUS RELIEF DURING THE SESSION AND AFTER THE SESSION AND IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT FOR REASONS THAT YOU NOW UNDERSTAND THE ACTIVATION OF PARTICULAR BRAINNET WORKS THE SUPPRESSION OF OTHER BRAINNETWORKS IN PARTICULAR THIS AMIGDULA TO INSOLA PATHWAY THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M D  MA IN THESE VERY SAFE AND THERAPEUTIC SUPPORT OF SETTINGS THE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT TRAMATIC EVENTS AND THE WAYS THAT THOSE DRAMATIC VENTS IMPACT THEM IN WAYS THAT REALLY ALLOW THEM TO COGNIVELY REFRAIN THOSE EVENTS AND SOMATICALLY REFRAME THOSE EVENTS TO REALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT IT LIVES IN THEIR BODY AN MIND SO THAT IT'S NO LONGER INVASIVE AND THAT THEY CAN GO ON AND LEAD PRODUCTIVE ADAPTIVE LIVES AND AS A FINAL POINT RELATED TO THESE CLINICAL STUDIES I OF COURSE IT WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T TOUCH ON SOME OF THE SO CALLED ADVERSE EFFECTS BECAUSE ANY TIME THERE'S A DRUG OR TALK THERAPY FOR A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED AND I THINK IT'S QUITE REASSURING THAT IN THE CASE OF EMD M A THERAPY THERE WERE NO INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS OR SUICIDALITY OR OBSESSION WITH SUICIDE CONTRASTS THAT WITH THE GROUP THAT RECEIVE PLOCIBO WHERE THERE WERE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BASE LINE AND PREDICTED OBSESSIONS WITH SUICIDE UNFORTUNATELY LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE WAS NO ACTUAL SUICIDE ATTEMPT OR SUCCESSFUL SUICIDE THANKFULLY BUT THE POINT BEING THAT THE ADDITION OF MD MA DRUG THERAPY TO PT ST TALK THERAPY DOES NOT SEEM TO INCREASE THE COLINCIDE EFFECTS THAT ARE SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH PT ST TALK THERAPY BECAUSE INDEED THER CAN BE SIDE AFFECTS TO EXPLORING PT ST AND TRAMA AS ONE WOULD EXPECT SO OVER ALL I WOULD SAY IT'S VERY EXCITING TIMPTS FOR THE EXPLORATION OF M D MA AS AN AUGMENTO TALK THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF PT ST AN TESE OTHER CONDITIONS AGAIN I THINK THE MAP'S GROUP HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF KEEPING THIS WITHIN THE REALM OF LEGAL AND TRYING TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION TO MAKE SURE THAT EMD MA ISN'T SIMPLY MAY LEGAL AND THEN ABUSED RECREATIONALLY I KNOW PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON WHETHER OR NOT DRUGS LIKE EMDY MA SHOULD BE LEGAL OR NOT IT'S NOT WITH THIS EPISODE IS ABOUT WHAT I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL WHAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOATRY COMMUTY OR VERY EXCITED ABOUT YOU SAY THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUDY AT LARGE IS THAT THESE COMPOUNDS THAT FOR MANY YEARS WERE ONLY ASSOCIATE WITH THEIR RECREATIONAL USES AND THEREFORE WERE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE THEY WERE OFTEN CONTAMINATED OR TAKEN IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER THINGS OR BY PEOPLE THAT NEVER I SHOULD HAE BEEN TAKEN THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE A A TAKEN BY YOUNG KIDS WHICH IS A WHOLE OTHER MATTER UN LOT OF ISSUES AND PROBLEMS ASSOCIATE WITH THESE COMPOUNDS AND YET WERE NOW SEEN FROM THESE CLINICAL TRIALS WHEN USED PSAY PROPERLY BECAUSE REALLY WHEN SAFETY PROTOCALS ARE OBEYED WHEN THERE'S CLINICAL SUPPORT IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WHEN EM DIA MA IS COMBINED WITH QUALITY TALK THERAPY THAT THE OUTCOMES ARE LOOKING TREMENDOUSLY POSITIVE IT'S BY NO MEANS A MIRACLE CURE IT IS BY NO MEANS PERFECT AND TIME WILL TELL O WHAT PROBLEMS IF ANY ARISE FROM THE SHORT OR LONG TERM USE OF M D MA IN THIS CONTECT BUT I THNK IT'S REMARKABLE THAT ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO THREE SESSIONS WITH EM DA MA AN TAL THERAPY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PT ST SYMPTOMS AND IN SOME CASES COMPLETELY ELIMINATE PT ST SYMPTOMS IN SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF PATIENCE N IN PATIENCE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED BOTH PT ST AND THESE OTHER COMORVID DISORDERS I THINK IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE IT'S VERY EXCITING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THE NEXT ROUND OF DATA PRODUCE SO AS IS OFTEN THE CASE ON THIS BODCAST TO DAY WE WENT INTO A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT A SUBJECT M DI A MA IS THIS INCREDIBLE COMPOUNDS SYNTHESIZED AS FAR AS WE KNOW FIRST BY HUMANS NOT BY PLANTS NOT BY ALIENS BUT BY HUMANS AND THAT PRODUCES BIG INCREASES IN DOPENING AND CERETONAN TO CREATE THESE HIGHLY MODIVATED PROSOCIAL EMPATHIC STATES MEANING BOTH AMPATHY FOR OTHERS AND FOR SELF AND THAT WHEN APPLIED IN THE CONTEXT OF PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES LIKE PT ST AND ADDICTION IS PROVING TO CREATE A LOT OF RELIEF FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHERE OTHER FORMS OF DRUG THERAPE OR COMMINATION DRUG AN TALK THERAPY HAD FAILED BEFORE WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE POTENTIAL NUR TOXTICITY ISSUES I DON'T THINK THAT IS A RESOLVE ISSUE JUST YET ALTHOUGH THE BULK OF DATA AND HUMANS AND NON HUMAN PRIMATES POINT TO THE FACT THAT AT REASONABLE DOSES AND WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT WHAT THOSE ARE AT REASONABLE DOSES WHEN NOT COMBINED WITH OTHER DRUGS DOES NOT APPEAR THAT M D MA IS EXCEEDINGLY NEROTOXIC AND IT MAY NOT BE NEUROTOXIC AT ALL OF COURSE ONE NEEDS TO BE EXCEEDINGLY CAUTIOUS WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE USE OF ANY SYMPATHEMEMETIC THEY OF COURSE IT CAN BE NEUROTOXIC ANYTHING WITH METHEM PHEDEMIN N AS A POTENTIAL TO BE NEUROTOIC BUT OF COURSE A DOSAGE MATTERS CONTEXT MATTERS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND OF COURSE THE PURITY OF DRUG MATTERS AND AGAIN I JUST WANT A RE EMPHASIZE THE VENTINAL CONTAMINATION OF M D MA THAT SOLD ON THE STREET AND THAT IS BEING USED RECREATIONAL IS OF VERY SERIOUS POTENTIALLY LEATHFAL CONCERN I ALSO EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF INTEREST IN THESE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT MAPSIS DOING SO AGAIN YOU FIND LINKS TO THAT IN THE SHOWNOCAPTIONS AND I THINK IN GENERAL WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE A VERY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY FOR THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS END FOR NEUROSINS GENERALLY BECAUSE WHETHER NOT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SYLICIVE AN OR ELLISTI OR IOWASKA OR KETEMINE OR TO DAY'S TOPIC OF M D MA REGARDLESS OF WHAT DRUG AND NEURO TRANSMITTER NORMODULATOR SYSTEMS ARE INVOLVED WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT OUR WAYS TO ACCESS NEURO PLASTICITY THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO MODIFY ITSELF IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE IDEALY TO BE MODIFIED IN ADAPTIVE WAYS THAT MAKE IT FUNCTION BETTER SO THAT'S REALLY THE CRUX OF WHAT TALK THERAPEAN DRUG THERAPIES ARE ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL OF USING M D M AS A CLINICAL TOOL IS ALL ABOUT AND IN THAT SENSE I FIND M D MA TO BE AN INCREDIBLY

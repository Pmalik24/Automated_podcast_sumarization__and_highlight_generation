WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONCE DISCUSSE SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  FOR   I M ENDER HUBERMAN AND OM PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY GUEST TO DAY ARE MARK ZOUKEBERG AND DOCTOR PRISCILLA CHAN MARKZUKEBERG AS EVERYBODY KNOWS FOUNDED THE COMPANY FACE BOOK HE IS NOW THE C E O OF METTA WHICH INCLUDES FACEBOOK INSTERGRAHM WHATSAP AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS DOCTOR PRISCILLA CHAN GRADUATED FROM HARVARD AND WENT ON TO DO HER MEDICAL DEGREE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO MARK ZKEBERG AND DOCTOR PRISILLA HAN ARE MARRIED AND THE COFOUNDERS OF THE C Z I OR CHAN ZUKEBERG INICIATIVE A PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATION WHOSE STATE GOAL IS TO CURE ALL HUMAN DISEASES THE CHANZZOKEBERG INITIATIVE IS ACCOMPLISHING THAT BY PROVIDING CRITICAL FUNDING NOT AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE AS WELL AS A NOVEL FRAMEWORG FOR DISCOVERY OF THE BASIC FUNCTIONING OF CELLS CATALOGUING ALL THE DIFFERENT HUMAN CELL TYPES AS WELL AS PROVIDING A I OR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PLATFORMS TO MINE ALL OF THAT DATA TO DISCOVER NEW PATHWAYS AND CURES FOR ALL HUMAN DISEASES THE FIRST HOUR OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS HELD WITH BOTH DOCTOR PRISCILLA CHAN AND MARK ZUKEBERG DURING WHICH WE DISCUSS THE C Z I AND WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO TRY IND CURE ALL HUMAN DISEASES WE TALK ABOUT THE MOTIVATIONAL BACKBONE FOR THE C Z IY THAT EXTENDS WELL INTO EACH OF THEIR PERSONAL HISTORIES INDEDIOLL LEARN QUITE A LOT ABOUT DOCTOR PRISCILLA CHAN WHO HAS I MUST SAY AN ABSOLUTE INCREDIBLE FAMILY STORY LEADING UP TO HER ROLE AS A PHYSICIAN AND HER MOTIVATIONS FOR THE C Z I AND BEYOND AND YOU'LL LEARN FROM MARK HOW HE IS BRINGING AN ENGINEERING AN A I PERSPECTIVE TO DISCOVERY OF NEW CURES FOR HUMAN DISEAS THE SECOND HALF OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS JUST BETWEEN MARK ZOKEBERG AND ME DURING WHICH WE DISCUSS VARIOUS META PLATFORMS INCLUDING OF COURSE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON MENTAL HEALTH IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS WE ALSO DISCUSS V R VIRTUAL REALITY AS WELL AS AUGMENTED AND MIXED REALITY AND WE DISCUSS A I ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HOW IT STANDS TO TRANSFORM NOTJHUS OUR ON LINE EXPERIENCES WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES BUT HOW IT STANDS TO POTENTIALLY TRANSFORM EVERY ASPECT OF EVERYDAY LIFE BEFORE WOU BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZED AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPASCITY I SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP REALLY IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT'S SLEEP IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IS CORRECT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL IN STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN PROGRAME THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IN THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF YOUR NIGHT AN HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES LIKE TRACKING THE AMOUNT OF RAPID I MOVEMENT AND SLOW WAVE SLEEP THAT YOU GET THINGS ARE ESSENTIAL TO REALLY DILING IN THE PERFECT NIGHTS SLEEP FOR YOU I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON AN EHTESLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR WELL OVER TWO YEARS NOW AND IT HAS GREATLY IMPROVED MY SLEEP BY FALL ASLEEP FAR MORE QUICKLY I WAKE UP FAR LESS OFTEN IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND I WAKE UP FEELING FAR MORE REFRESHED THAN I EVER DID PRIOR TO USING NATE SLEEP MATTRESS COVER IF YOU LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO SAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURNTLY SHIPS TO THE U SS A CANADA U K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE U AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMENT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO A S BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF ELECTROLITES SODIUM MAGNESIUM AN POTASSIUM AND NO SUGAR THE ELECTROLIHTES ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR THE FUNC TIONING OF EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY AND YOUR NURONS YOUR NERVE CELLS RELY ON SODIA MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER ELECTRICALLY AND CHEMICALLY ELEMENT CONTAINS THE OPTIMAL RATIO OF ELECTROLYTES FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF NURONS AND THE OTHER CELLS OF YOUR BODY EVERY MORNING I DRINK A PACKET OF ELEMENT DISSOLVED IN ABOUT THIRTY TWO OUNCES OF WATER I DO THAT JUST FOR GENERAL HYDRATION AND TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE ADEQUATE ELECTROLITES FOR ANY ACTIVITIES THAT DAY I'LL OFTEN ALSO HAVE AN ELEMENT PACKET OR EVEN TWO PACKETS IN THIRTY TWO TO SIXTY OUNCESOF WATER IF I'M EXERCISING VERY HARD AND CERTAINLY IF I'M SWEATING A LOT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT I REPLACE THOSE ELECTROLITES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK L M N T DOC CM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET A FREE SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK L M N T DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN I'M PLEASE TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE WILL BE HOSTING FOUR LIVE EVENTS IN AUSTRALIA EACH OF WHICH IS ENTITLED THE BRAIN BODY CONTRACT DURING WHICH I WILL SHARE SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE THERE WILL ALSO BE A LIVE QUESTION IN ANSWER SESSION WE HAVE LIMITED TICKETS STILL AVAILABLE FOR THE EVENT IN MELBOURNE ON FEBRUARY TENTH AS WELL AS THE EVENT IN BRIZBIN ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTH OUR EVENT IN SIDNEY AT THE SIDNEY OPERA HOUSE SOLD OUT VERY QUICKLY SO AS A CONSEQUENCE WE'VE NOW SCHEDULED A SECOND EVENT IN SIDNEY AT THE AWARE SUPERTHEADER ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH TO ACCESS TICKETS TO ANY OF THESE EVENTS YOU CAN GO TO HUBERMAN LABDOC CAM SLASH EVENTS AND USE THE COTE HUBERMAN AT CHECKOUT I HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE AND AS ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN SCIENCE AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH MARKZUKERBERG AND DOCTOR PRISCILLA CHAN PRISCILLA MARK SO GREAT TO MEET YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE IN YOUR HOME I THANKSTRAVINES ON THE POTCAS YET LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE CZ EYE THE CHAN ZUKERBURG INITIATIVE I LEARNED ABOUT THIS A FEW YEARS AGO WEN MY LAB WASAN STILL IS NOW AT STAMFORT AS A VERY EXCITING PHILANTHROPIC EFFORT THATAS A TRULY BIG MISSION I CAN'T IMAGINE A BIGGER MISSION SO MAB BE HEU TELL S WHAT THAT BIG MISSIAN IS AND THEN WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THE MECHANICS OF HOW THE BIG MISSION CAN BECOME M REALITY SO AT LIKE YOUR MENTIONING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A WE LAUNCHED THE CHANCE LICOBER CONITIATIVE AND WHAT WE ARE HOPING TO DO AT SEESY I WAS THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE BUILD A BETTER FUTURE FOR EVERYONE AND LOOKING FOR WAYS WHERE WE CAN CONTRIBUTE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE TO BRING PHILANTHROPICALLY AND THE EXPERIENCEIS THAT MARK AND I HAVE HAD FOR ME AS A PHYSICIAN AND EDUCATOR REMARK AS AN ENGINEER AND THEN OR ABILITY TO BRING TEAMS TOGETHER TO BUILD BUILDERS A YOU KNOW MARK HAS A BEEN A BUILDER THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER AND WHAT COULD WE DO IF WE ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER TEAM TO BUILD TOOLS A DO GREAT SCIENCE AND SO WITHIN OUR SCIENCE PORTFULLYVE WE REALLY BEEN PHOCUSED ON WHAT A SOME PEOPLE THINK IS EITHER AN INCREDIBLY AUDACIOUS GOAL OR A INEVITABLE GOAL BUT I THINK ABOUT IT AS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE SORT OF CONTINUE FOCUSING ON IT WHICH IS TO BE ABLE TO CURE PREVENT OUR MANAGE ALL DISEASE BY THE END OF THE SENTURY OLD DISEASE ALL DISEASE SO THAT'S IMPORTANARY THEN A LOT OF TIME PEOPLE ASK LIKE WHICH DISEASE AND THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT THERE IS NOT ONE DISEASE IN IT'S REALLY ABOUT TAKING A STEP ACK A TO WHERE I ALWAYS FOUND THE MOST HOPE AS A PHYSICIAN WHICH IS NEW DISCOVERIES AN NEW OPPORTUNITIES AN NEW WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING HOW TO KEEP PEOPLE WELL COME FROM BASIC SCIENCE SO OUR STRATEGY AT SESII IS REALLY TO BUILD TOOLS FUN SCIENCE A CHANGE THE WAY BASIC SCIENTISTS CAN SEE THE WORLD AND HOW THEY CAN MOVE QUICKLY IN THEIR DISCOVERIES AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE LAUNCH IN  A TWENTY FIFTEEN WE WE DO WORK IN THREE WAYS WE A FUND GREAT SCIENTISTS WE A BUI OLD TOOLS I RIGHT NOW SOUTHWOR TOOLS TO HELP MOVE SCIENS ALONG  MAKE IT EASIER FOR SCIENCISTS TO DO THEIR WORK AN WE DO SCIENCE A YOU MENTIONED STAMFORD BEING A IMPORTANT PELLER FOROUR SCIENCE WORK WE'VE BUILT AT WHAT WE CALL BILEHUBS INSTITUTES WHERE TEAMS CAN TAKE ON GRAND CHALLENGES TO DO WORK THAT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE IN A SINGLE LAB OR WITHIN A SINGLE DISCIPLINE AND OUR FIRST BILEHUB WAS LAUNCHED IN SAN FRANCISCO A COLLABORATION BETWEEN STAMFORD YOU SEE BERKELEY AND YOU SEE USELF MAZING A CURING ALL DISEASES A IMPLIES THAT THERE WILL EITHER BE A TON OF KNOWLEDGE GLEAN FROM THIS EFFORT WHICH I 'M CERTAIN THERE WILL BE AND THERE ALREADY HAS BEEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE EARLY SUCCESS IS IN A MOMENT BUT IT ALSO SORT OF IMPLIES IT IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND SOME BASIC OPERATIONS OF DISEASES AND CELLS THAT TRANSCEND BAUTISM HUNTINGTONS PARKINSONS CAN'T SIR AND ANY OTHER DISEASE THAT PERHAPS THERE ARE SOME COOR PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD MAKE THE BIGMISSION A REAL REALITY SO TO SPEAK AN WHAT A BASE HE SAYING IS AN HOW ARE YOU ATTACKING THIS A MIGHT BELIEF IS THAT THE CELL SINCE AT THE CENTRE OF ALL DISCUSSION ABOUT DISEASE I'M GIVEN THAT OUR BODIES MADE UP OF OF CELLS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS SO MAYBE  A JUST LUMINATE FOR US LTLE BIT OF WHAT THE CELL IS IN YOUR MIND AS IT RELATES TO DISEASE AND HOW ONE GOES ABOUT UNDERSTANDING DISEASE IN THE CONTEXT OF CELLS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MADE UP OF YET WELL LET' LET'S GET TO THE CELL THING IN A MOMENT BUT JUST EVEN TAKEN A STEP BACK FROM THAT NO WE DON'T THINK THAT IT SEES THE EYE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CURE PREVENT OUR MOUNTAGE ALL DISEASES THE GOL IS TO TOBASICALLY GIVE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND SCIENTIST SURROUND THE WORLD THE TOOLS TO ACCELERATE THE PACE OF SCIENCE AND TAN WE WE SPELL A LOT OF TIME WHEN WE'RE GTTING STARTED WITH THIS LOOKING AT THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE TRENS AND AND HAVE THE PLAD OUT OVER TIME AND IF YOU LOOK OVER THE THIS VERY LONG TURM ARK MOST LARGE SCALE DISCOVERIES ARE PRECEDED BY THE INVENTION OF A NEW TOOL OR A NEW WAY TO SEE SOMETHING IT IT'S NOT JUST IN BIOLOGY RIGHT IT'S LIKE HAVING A TELESCOPE IM IN A CAME BEFORE A LOT OF IM DISCOVERIES AIN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS AM BUT SIMILARLY IN MICROSCOPE AND AM AN INDIFFERNT WAYS TO OBSERVE THINGS OR DIFFERENT PLATFORMS LIKE THE ABILITO DO VAXENS PRECEDED THE ABILITY TO CAN OF CURE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AM SO THIS IS SORT OF THE ENGINEERING PART THAT YOU WARE TALKING ABUT ABOUT BUILDING TOOLS WE WEVE YOU ARE GOAL IS TO TRY TO BRING TOGETHER SOME SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE TO BUILD TOOLS THAT EMPOWER THE WHOLE FIELD AM AND THAT'S THAT SORT OF THE BIG ARK AND IN A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WERE FOCUSET ON INCLUDING THE THE WORK IN IN SINGLE CELL AND IN SELL UNDERSTANDING WHICH IM  YOU CAN YOU CAN JUMP IN AND GET INTO THAT IF YOU WANT BUT YE I THINK I THINK WE GENERALLY AGREE WITH THE PRIMIS THAT IF YOU WANT A UNDERSTAND THE STUFF FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES M PEOPLE STUDY ORGANS A LOT WRITE THY LIKE THE STUDY CON OF HOW THINGS PRESENT ACROSS THE BODY BUT THERE'S NOT A VERY WIDESPREAD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CAN OF EACH CELL OPERATES AND THIS IS SORT OF A BIG PART OF YOU KNOW SOMELY INITIAL WORK THAT WE TRY TO DO ON THE HUMAN CELL AT LESS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT TO THE DIFFERENT CELLS AND MTHERE'S THERE'S A MUCH MORE WORK THAT WE WANTOD DO TO CARRY THAT FORWARD BUT AM BUT OVER ALL I THINK ENWE THINK ABOUT THE NEXT TEN YEARS HERE OF THIS LONG ARC TO TRY TO EMPOWER THE COMMUNITY TO TO M BEALD TO CURE PREVENT OR  MANAGE ALL DISEASES WE WANT THAT WE THINK THE NEXT TEN YEARS SHOULD REALLY BE PRIMARILY ABOUT BE ABLE TO MEASURE AN OBSERVE MORE THINGS AND INHUMAN BIOLOGY THERE ARE A LOT OF LIMITS TO THEENT'S LIKE YOU ON A LOOK AT SOMETING HROUGH A MICROSCOPE YOU CAN'T USUALLY SEE LIVING TISSUES BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO OU  SEE THROUGH SKIN OR THINGS LIKE TH HATS FOR THERE THE'RE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES  THEY WILL HELP US OBSERVE DIFFERENT THINGS AND THIS IS SORT OF WARE THE ENGINEERING BACKGROUND COMES IN A BIT BECAUSE ND IT'S WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS IS FROM THE POSPECTIVE LIKE HOW YOU'D WRITE CODE OR SOMETHING YOU'RE THE IDEA OF LIKE TRANA D BOGER FIX A CODE BASE PONOPULETLIKE STEP THROUGH THE COD LINE BY LINE THAT'S LIKE NEV NOT CIN HAPPEN RITIN D THAT THE BEGINNG OF ANY BIG PROJECT THAT WE DO A AT METTA AND WE LIKE TO SPEND A BUNCH OFTHE TIME A FRUNCH IS TRIN INSTRUMENT THINGS AND UNDERSTAND IN N ORD WECAN TO LOOK OUT AND HOW WE CAN A MEASURE THINGS BEFORE A SO WE KNOW WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS AND KNOW WHAT TO OPTIMISES AND THIS IS SUCH A LONG TERM JOURNEY THAT AND WE THINK THAT IT ACTION MAKES SENSE TO TAKE THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO BUILD THOSE KIND OF TOOLS A FOR BIOLOGY AND UNDERSTANDING A JUST HOW TO HUMAN BODY WORKS IN ACTION AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS ITSELLS AN DO YOU N JUMP IN TACKA TOCK ABOUT SON THE AFFIRTS ULD I A JUST A INTRUP BRIEFLY AND JUST ASK ABOUT THE THE DIFFERENT AM THE DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS SO TO SPEAK AM THAT SEASY EYES IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO TO BRING TO THE QUEST TO CURE ALL DISEASES SO I CAN THINK OF I MEAN I KNOW AS A SCIENTIST THAT A MONEY IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT RIGT LIKE T WHEN YOU HAVE MONEY CAN HIREMORE PEOPLE YOU CAN TRY DIFFERENT THINGS SO THAT THAT'S CRITICAL BUT A LOT OF PHILANTHROPY INCLUDES MONEY UM THE OTHER COMPONENT IS YOU A YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THINGS AS YOU POINTED OUT AM SEE WONT TO KNOW THAT NORMAL DISEASE PROCESS BUT WHAT WHAT IS A HEALTHY CELL WHAT'S A DISEASE SELL OUR SELLS CONSTANTLY BEING MOMBARDED WITH WI CHALLENGES AND THEN REPAIRING THOSE AND THEN WHAT WE CALL CANCER IS JUST KIND OF RUNAWAY TRAIN OF THOSE CHALLENGES NOT BEING MET BY THE SLL ITSELF FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AM SO BETTER IMAGING TOOLS AND THEN AM IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S NOT JUST A HARD WARE COMPONENT BUT A SOFTWORK COMPONENT THIS IS WHERE A I COMES IN SO MAY WE CAN THAT'S SOMEPHONT WE WE CAN BREAK THIS UP INTO TO THREE DIFFERENT AVENUES ONE IS UNDERSTANDING DISEASE PROCESSEASE AND HEALTHY PROCEES WILL LUMP THOSE TOGETHER THEN THERE'S HARD WA RE SO MICROSCOPES LENDSES DID YOU'T OLD DECONVOLUTION WAYS OF SEEING THINGS IN BOLDER RELIEF AND MORE MORE MORE A PRECISION AND THEN THERE'S HOW TO MANAGE ALL THE DATA AND THEN I LOVE THE IDEA THAT MAYBE E I COULD DO WHAT HUMAN BRAINS CAN'T DO ALONE I MANAGE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATEIXCAUSE IT'S ONETHING TO ORGANIZED DATE IT'S ANOTHER TO SAY OW UNIT YE THIS AS YOU POINT OUT THE KNOWLODGY WITH TOD THAT THIS PARTICULAR GENE AND THAT PARTICULAR GENE OR PETENTIALLY INTERESTING WORD AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD NEVER MAKE THAT POTENTIAL CONNECTION SO YOU KNOW THE TOOLS THAT SEASY I CAN BRING TO THE TABLE WE WE FUN SCIENCE LIKE YOUR TALKING ABOUT AN WE TRY TO A THERE'S LOTS OF WAYST TO FUN SCIENCE AND JUST TO BE CLEAR  YOU KNOW WHAT WE FUND IS A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT THE AND I ACH FUNS FOR INSTANCE SO WE NEW IF YOU GOS HAVE BEEN GENEROUS ENOUGH THAT IT'S A IT DEVILLY OM HOLDS WEIGHT ITTO AIH A ANYUS CONTRIBUTION YET AND BUT I THINK IT EVERY EVERY FUNDER HAS ITS OWN ROLE AND EGO SYSTEM AND FOR US IT'S REALLY HOW DO WE INCENTIVZE NEW POINTS OF VIEW HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE COLLABORATION HOW DO WE INCENTIVIE OPEN SCIENCE AND SO A LOT OF OUR GRANTS INCLUDE AM INVITING PEOPLE TO LOOK IN LOOK AT DIFFERENT FIELDS OUR FIRST NARROW SCIENCE AM GOR THEY WAS A AIM TOWARDS IN SENTIVISING PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS I MUNOLOGIST MICRO BIOLOGIST TO COME AND LOOK IT HOW OUR NERVOUS OSTEM WORKS AND HOW TO KEEP IT HEALTHY OR A WE AS THAT OUR GRANTEES PARTICIPATE IN THE PREPRINT MOVEMENT TO ACCELERATE THE RATE OF SHARING KNOWLEDGE AND ACTUALLY OTHERS BEING ABLE TO BUILD UPON SCIENCE SO THAT'S THE FUNDING THAT WE DO AM IN TERMS OF BUILDING AM WE WE BUILD SOPHWARE AND HARDWARE IM LIKE YOU MENTIONED WE PUT TOGETHER TEAMS THAT A CAN BUILD TOOLS THAT ARE MORE DURABLE AND SCALABLE AM THEN SOMEONE IN A SINGLE A LAB MIGHT BE INCENTIVIZED TO DO THERE'S A TON OF GREAT IDEAS AND A NOWADAYS MOST SCIENTISTS CAN TINKER AND BUILD SOMETHING USEFUL FOR THEIR LAP BUT IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO SHARE A THAT TOOLS SOMETIMES BEYOND THEIR OWN LAP TOP OR TFORGET YOU KNOW THE NEXT LAB OVER OR ACROSS THE GLOBE SO WE PARTNER WITH SCIENTISTS TO SEE LIKE WHAT IS USEFUL WHAT KINDS OF TOOLS YOU KNOW IN IMAGING NA PARRY LIKE IT'S THERE'S IT'S A USEFUL IMAGE INNOTATION TOOL A THAT IT IS BORNE FROM IN OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY AND HOW CAN WE CONTRIBUTE TO THAT OR A SELLBYGENE WHICH A WORKS ON SINGLE SELDATA SETS AN HOW CAN WE MAKE IT BUILD A USEFUL TOOL SO THAT SCIENTISTS CAN SHARIDATE A SETS ANALYZE THEIR OWN AND CONTRIBUTE TO A LARGER A CORPUS OF INFORMATION SO WE HAVE SOFTWOR TEAMS THAT ARE BUILDING COLLABORATING WITH SCIENTISTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING EASY TO USE DURABLE TRANSLATABLE TOOLS ACROSS THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNIN THE AREAS THAT WE WORK IN A WE ALSO HAVE INSTITUTES THIS IS WHERE THE IMAGING  WORK COMES IN WERE YOU KNOW WE ARE PROUD OWNERS OF ELECTRONMOK RECSCOPE FINE NOW A IT ITS GUN TOBE INSTALLED AM ET OUR IMAGING INSTITUTE AND THAT WILL REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE WAY WHERE WE CAN SEE WORK DIFFERENTLY BUT WE CAN E MORE HARDWORE NEE DOES NEED TO BE DEVELOPED YOU KNOW WERE PARTNERING WITH A FANTASTIC SCIENTISTS AM IN THE BIHAB NETWORK TO BUILD A A A MEDI FACE PLATE TO INCREASE TO LINE THE ELECTRONS THROUGH THESE AM THROUGH THE ELECTROMICROSCOPE TO BEABLE TO INCREASE THE RESOLUTIONS WE CAN SEEM IN SHARPER DETAIL TO A SO THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATIVE WORK WITHIN THE NETWORK THAT'S HAPPENING A AND A THESE INSTITUTES HAVE GRAND CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON A BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT CELLS SELLS ARE JUST THE SMALLEST UNIT THAT ER ALIVE AND EM ARE YOUR BODY EVERY EVERY ALL OF OUR BODIES HAVE MANY MANY MANY CELLS THERE'S YOU KNOW SOME ESTIMATED LIKE THIRTY SEVEN TRILLIAN CELLS DIFFERENT CELLS IN YOUR BODY AND WHAT ARE THEY ALL DOING AND HOW WHADO THEY LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY'REHEALTH IN YOU'RE EALTHY WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU'RE SICK AND EM WERE WERE AT RIGHT NOW WITH YOU KNOW OR UNDERSTANDING OF CELLS AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET SICK IS BASICALLY WE HAVE WE WE'VE GOTTEN PRETTY GOOD AT FROM THE HUMAN GENIO PROJECT LOOKING AT HOW DIFFERENT MUTATIONS IN YOUR GYNETIC CODE LEAD FOR YOU TO BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GET SICK OR DIRECTLY CAUSE YOU TO GET SICK SO WE GO FROM A MUTATION IN YOUR DIONAE TO WOW YOU NOW HAVE HUNTINGTONS STIZZIES FOR INSTANCE AND THERE'S A LOT THAT HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER AT AT SEAZY EYE IS WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS SO AN ANALOGY THAT I USED I LIKE TO USE TO SHARE WITH MY FRIENDS IS RIGHT NOW SAY WE'VE A RECIPE FOR A CAKE WE KNOW THERE'S A TYPO IN THE RECIPE AND THEN THE CAKE IS AWFUL THAT'S ALL WE KNOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE SHEP INTERPRETS THE TYPHO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE OVEN AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE KNO SORT OF HOW IT'S EXACTLY CONNECTED TO HOW THE CAKE DIDN'T TURN OUT HOW YOU A AD EXPECTED A LOT OF THAT U IS UNKNOWN BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY SYSTEMATICALLY TRY TO BREAK THIS DOWN AN ONE SEGMENT OF THAT JOURNEY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS HOW THAT MUTATION GETS TRANSLATED AND ACTED UPON IN YOU'R SELLS AN ALL F YOUR CELLS HAVE WHAT'S CALLED EM ARNEE EM ARINAE ARE THE ACTUAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE TAKEN FROM THE DIONEE AN WHAT OR WORK IN SINGLE CELL IS LOOKING AT HOW HOW EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY IS ACTUALLY INTERPRETING YOUR DEONAE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HEALTHY CELLS ARE INTERPRETING THE DEANA INSTRUCTIONS AND WHEN SICX CELLS ARE INTERPRETING THOSE DIRECTIONS AND THAT IS A TON OF DATA I JUST TOLD YOU THERE'S THIRTY SEVEN SHILLION ELLS THERE'S DIFFERENT A LARGE AND SETS OF AMARNA AN EACH CELL BUT THE WORK THAT WEEP IN FUNDING IS LEART LOOKING AT HOW A FIRST OWHALL GATHERING THAT INFORMATION U WE'VE BEEN A INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO BE PART OF A VERY FAST MOVING A FIELD WHERE WE'VE GONE FROM IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FUNDING SOME METHODS WORK TO NOW HAVING REALLY NOT COMPLETE BUT NEARLY COMPLETE ATLASES OF HOW THE HUMAN BODY WORKS HOW FLIES WORK HOW MICE WORK  AT THE SINGLE CELL LEVEL IN BEING ABLE TO THEN TRY TO PIECE TOGETHER LIKE HOW DOES THAT ALL COME TOGETHER AND WHEN YOU'RE HEALTHY AND WHEN YOU'RE SICK IN THE NEAT THING ABOUT THE SORT OF INFLECTION POINT WERE WE'RE AT IN A I IS THAT I CAN'T LOOK AT THIS DATA AND MAKE SENSE OF IT THERE JUST TOO MUCH OF IT AND BIOLOGY'S COMPLEX HUMAN BODIES ARE COMPLEX WE NEED THIS MUCH INFORMATION BUT THE USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS CAN HELP US ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT DATA AND GAIN INSIGHTS LOOK AT WHAT TRENDS ARE CONSISTENT WITH HEALTH AND WHAT TRENDS ARE A ARE UNSUSPECTED AN EVENTUALLY OUR HOPE A THROUGH A THE USE OF THESE DATA SETS THAT WE'VE HELPED CURATE IN THE APPLICATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS IS TO BE ABLE TO FORMULATE A VIRTUAL CELL A CELL THAT'S COMPLETELY A A BUILT OFF OF THE DATA SETS OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY BUT ALLOWS US TO MANIPULATE AND LEARN FASTER AND TRYI NEW THINGS A TO HELP MOVE SCIENCE AND THEN A MEDICINE ALOW DO YOU THINK WE'VE CATALOGUED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES YOUR EVERY WEEK I LOOK AT GREAT JOURNALS LIKE CELL NATURE AND SCIENCE AND FRINCES I SAW RECENTLY THAT UM USING SINGLE SELL SEQUENCING THEY'V AM CATEGRIZED EIGHTEEN PLUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT CELLS WE ALWAYS HINK IT LIKE A FAT CELVERS AS OF MUSCLE CELLS A SO NOW YOUVE GOT EIGHTEEN TYPES AM EACH ONE IS GOING TO EXPRESS MANY MANY DIFFERENT GENES AND ARONASE EMARONASE AND PERHAPS THE AONE OF THEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU KNOW WHAT WE SEE IN IT YOU KNOW ADVANCE TYPE TO DIBETES OR UM IN OTHER FORMS OF OBECITY OR WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T LAY DOWN FAT CELLS WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE JJUST AS DETRIMENTAL IN THOSE EXTREME CASES SO NOW YO'VE GOT ALL THESE LISTS OF GENES BUT UM IE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF SINGLE CELL SEQUINS SYING AS ITNECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT BUT YOU NEED THE INFORMATION BUT IT DOESN'T RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND I THINK OF IT MORE OF I AS A HYPOTHESIS GENERATING EXPERIMENT A YOU YOUOCASE YU OF ALL THESE GENES HE COULD SAY WHILE THIS GENE IS PARTICULARLY ELEVATED IN THE UM DIABETICS CELL TYPE OF WHAT' AY ONE OF THESE FAT CELLS OR MUSCLE CELLS FOR THAT MATTER UM WHEREAS IT'S NOT IN NONDIABETICS SO THEN OF THE MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT CELLS MAYBE ONLY A FIVE OF THEM DIFFER DRAMATICALLY SO THEN YOU OUGENERATE HYPOTHESIS OH IT'S THE ONES THAT DIFFER DRAMATICALLY THAT ARE IMPORTANT BUT MAYBE ONE OF THOSE GENES WHEN IT'S ONLY YOU KNOW FIFTY PER CENT CHANGED HAS A HUGE A FACT BECAUSE OF SOME NETWORK BYOLGY EFFECT AND SO I GUES WHAT I'M TRYNTED UM GET TO HERE IS YOU KNOW HOW DOES ONE MEET THAT CHALLENGE AND CAN A I HELP RESOLVE THAT CHALLENGE BY ESSENTIALLY PLACING THOSE LISTS OF GENES INTO A A YOU KNOW TEN THOUSAND HYPOTHESIS CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU THAT THE GRADUATE SUNES IN POSTOXS IN MY LAB GET A CHANCE TO TEST ONE HYPOTHESIS ANN NO AND THAT'S REALLY THE CHALLEGES LET ALONE ONE LAB AND UM SO FOR THOSE ARE LISTENING O THIS AND YOU KOW WHOFLEET'S NOT GETTING OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF OF KIND OF LIKE STANDARD UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERSTANDING WE' GENERATED HURE BUT WHAT BUSY SAING IS YOU HAVE TO PICK AT SOME POINT MORE DO IT ALWAYS SOUNDS GREAT BUT THEN HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO TEST SO NO WE DON'T KNOW ALL THE SELL TYPES UEM I THINK ONE OV THE ONE THING THAT WAS REALLY EXCITING WHEN WE FIRST LAUNCHED  THIS WORK WAS YOU KNOW CYSTIC FIRASIS LIKE CYSTIC FIBROSISIS CAUSED BY MUTATION AND C FT RE THAT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN IT AFFECTS A CERTAIN CHANNEL THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR MUCUS TO BE CLEAR THAT'S THE BASICISYSTIC FIBROSIS WHEN I WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL IT WAS TOTIS FACT SO THEYARE LUNGS FILL UP WITH FLUID THESE PEOPLE CARRYING AROUND SACS OF FFLUID FILLING OUP BY YE KNOWN  PEOPLE I'VE WORKED WITH PEOPLE THAN THEY HAVE TO LARLY DUMP THE FLUIT OUT EXACTIT CAN'T RUN OR DO INTENS EXERCISE LIFE IS SHORTER LIFE IS SHORT  AND WHEN WE APPLIED SINGLE SELL METHODOLOGIES TO THE LUNGS THEY DISCOVERED AN ENTIRELY NEW CELL TYPE THAT ACTUALLY IS AFFECTED BY MUTATION IN THE C  MUTATIONS AN CYSTIC FIBROS THIS MUTATION THAT ACTUALLY CHANGE AS THE PARADISE OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT SYSTIC FIBROSI MIS  JUST ENOUGH SO I DON'T THINK WE KNOW UM ALL THE CELL TYPES I THIK WE'LL CONTINUE TO DISCOVER THEM AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DISCOVER NEW RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SELLEMN DISEASE WHICH LEADS ME TO THE SECOND EXAMPLE I ONA BRING UP IS UM THIS LARGE STATA SAT THAT THE ENTIRE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNIONS BUILT AROUND SINGLE CELL IS STARTING TO ALLOW US TO SAY THIS MUTATION WHERE IS IT EXPRESS WHAT TYPES OF CELL TYPES ITS EXPRESSED IN AND UM WE ACTUALLY HAVE BUILT A TOOL AT CE I CALLED CELL BYGENE WHERE YOU CAN PUT IN THE MUTATION THAT YOU'RE NTERESTED IN AND IT GIVES YOU A HEAT MAP OF CROSSTELL TYPES OF WHICH CELL TYPES ARE EXPRESSING THE A GENE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND SO THEN YOU CAN STARUT LOOKING AT O Q IF I LOOK AT GENE ACS AND I KNOW IT'S RELATED TO HEART DISEASE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEAT MAP IT'S ALSO SPIKING IN THE PANKREUS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GENERY O HYPOTHESIS WHY I'M AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS GENUS MUTATED AND IN YOU'REIN THE FUNCTION OF YOUR PANCRASS REALLY EXCITING WAY TO LOOK AND ASK QUESTIONS DIFFERENTLY UM AND YOU CAN ALSO IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE IF  YOU'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP A THERAPY A DRUG AND YOU'R YOUR THE GOAL IS TO TREAT THE FUNCTION THE HEART BUT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S ALSO REALLY ACTIVE IN THE PANCREAS AGAIN SO WHAT IS THERE GOING TO BE AN UNEXPECTED SIDE A FACT THAT YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT AS YOU'RE BRINGING A THIS STRUG TO CLONICAL TRIALS SO I IT'S AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING TOOL AND ONE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BETTER AS WE GET MORE MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS TO ANALYZE THE DATA MUST SAY I LOVE THAT BECAUSE IF I LOOK AT THE ADVANCES IN NERROU SCIENCE OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS MOST OF THEM UM DID NECESARILY COME FROM LOOKING AT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAME FROM THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE EMAN SYSTEM IMPACTS THE BRAIN EVERYON PRIOR TO THAT TALKED ABOUT THE BRAIN IS A MUNE PRIVILEGED ORGAN WUT YOU JUST SAID ALSO BRIDGES AND THEY DIVIDE BETWEEN SINGLE SELLS ORGANS AND SYSTEMS I BECAUSE ULTIMATELY SELLES MAKE UP ORGANS ORGAN TO MAKE UP SYSTEMS AN THE'RE LL TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND EVERYONE NOWADAYS IS FAMILIAR WITH LIKE GOT BRAIN ACES OR THA THE MICROBIUM BEING SO IMPORTANT BUT RARELY IS THE UM THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN ORGANS UM DISCUST A SO TO SPEAK SO UM I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL SO THAT THAT TOOL WAS GENERATED BY CESY IOR SESY I FUNDED THAT TOOL SO HW DOES HIS RE BUILT THAT WE BUILT THAT HE MUILT IT SO AS IT BUILT BY MEADOW IS AS BETTIS IS GOT HASS THE TON ENGINEERS GOT IT Y RIT AR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS CREDILE AND UM AND SO A GRADUATE SOONER POSTOCTORS INTEREST IN A PARTICULAR IMUTATION COULD PUT THIS IMUTATION INTO THIS DATE O BASE IM THAT GRAGE SONER POSTOCK MIGHT BE IN A LABORATORY KNOWN FOR WORKING ON HART BUT SUDDENLY FIND THAT THEY'RE COLLABORATING WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS THAT WORK ON THE PANCREAS YET UM WHICH IT ALSO IS WONDERFUL U BECAUSE IT BRIDGES THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THESE FIELDS FIELDS ARE SO SILOED AN SIGN S NOT JUST DIFFERENT BUILDINGS BUT THEY PEOPLE RARELY TALK UNLESS THINGS LIKE THIS ARE I MEAN THE GRADUATE STUDEN IS SOMEONE THAT WE WANT TO EMPOWER CAUSE ONE THERE THE FUTURE OF SCIENCE AS YOU NOW AND WITHIN CALBA GENE IF YOU PUT IN THE GENIOR INTERESTED IN AND IT SHOWS YOU THE HEAT MAP WE ALSO WILL CULL UP LIKE THE MOST RELEVANT PAPERS THAT G AND SO LIKE READ THESE THINGS FANTASTIC AS WE ALL KNOW QUALITY NUTRITION INFLUENCES OF COURSE OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR COGNIV FUNCTIONING OUR MEMORY OUR ABILITY TO LEARN NEW THINGS AND TO FOCUS AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF HIGH QUALITY NUTRITION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ENOUGH VIDEMENS AND MINERALS FROM HIGH QUALITY UNPROCESSD OR MINIMILY PROCESS SOURCES AS WELL AS ENOUGH PROBIOTICS AND PREBOTICS AND FIBR TO SUPPORT BASIALY ALL THE CELLAR FUNCTIONS IN OUR BODY INCLUDING THE GUP MICROBIOM NOW I LIKE MOST EVERYBODY TRY TO GET OPTIMAL NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS I DEALLY MOSTLY FROM MINIMALY PROCESSED OR NON PROCESS FOODS HOWEVER ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE FACE IS GETTING ENOUGH SERVINGS OF HIGH QUALITY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY AS WELL AS FIBER AND PROBIOTICS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY THOSE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S WHY WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE LONG BEFORE I EVER HAD A PODCAST I STARTED DRINKING A G ONE AND SO I'M DELIGHTED THE A G ONE IS SPONSORING THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL DRINK A G ONE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES ALL OF MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT PROVIDES INSURANCE THAT I GET THE PROPER AMOUNTS OF THOSE VIDEMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBR TO INSURE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE YOU CAN GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'RE GIVING AWAY FI FRE TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VIDEMAN D THREE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DOC CM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THAT SPECIAL OFER I JUST THINK GOING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION FROM BEFORE  ARE THERE CAN RE MORE SELLTYPES THEKE OAND DISCOVERED  I ASSUM SO RITE ME NO ATALOGUE OF THE STUFF AS EVER YOU IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE'R EVER DONE WHER WE KEEP ON FINDING MORE BUT I THINK THAT THAT GETS TO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK ER THE STRENGTHS OF OF A MODERN ELLALEMS IS THE ABILITY TO KIND OF IMAGINE DIFFERENT STATES THAT THINGS CAN BE IN SO FROM ALL THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND FUNDED ON THEYON THE HUMAN SELL ATLAS THERE IS A LARGE CORPOUS OF DATA THAT YOU CAN NOW TRAIN A A KUND OF LARGE SCALE A MODELON AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE DOING A IT' SEES OW WHICH I THNKI'S PRETTY EXCITING AS BUILDING A WHAT WE THINK IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST NON PROFIT LIFE SCIENCS A I CLUSTERS WRITED SYCA THE ORDER OF A THOUSAND G PUS AND IN IT'S LARGER THAN WHAT MOST PEOPLE OF ACCESS TO AN ACADEMIA YU CAN DO CENLUXURIOUS ENGINEERING WORK ON AND AM AND OUKNOWBODY BASILY TRAINING A MODEL WITH ALL F THE HUMAN SELL OUTLESS STATAAND IN A BUNCH OF OTHER  IT PUTS AS WELL WEWE THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BASICALLY IMAGINE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT STATES THAT THEY CAN BE IN AND WHEN THEY'RE HEALTHY END DISEASED AND HOW THEY'L INTERACT WITH A NO DIFFERENT A INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT POTENTIAL DRUGS BUT I MEAN I THINK THE STATE OF ELELEMS AND THIS IS WORTS IT'S HELPFUL O UNDERSTAND YOU N' HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING AND BE GROUNDED AND LIKE THE MODERN STATE OF A EYE M TESE THINGS ARE NOT FULL PROOF RIDO MEAN ONE OF THE FLAWS OF MODERN ELILEMS IS THEY HALLUCINATE RIGHT SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU MAKE ITS OF THAT THAT CAN BE AN ADVANTAGE RATHER THAN A DISADVANTAGE ND I THINK THE WAY THAT IT ENDS IT BEING IN ADVANTAGE IS WHEN THEY HELP YOU IMAGINE A BUNCH OF STATES THAT SOMEING CAN BE IN BUT THEN YOU KNO WIS THE SCIENTIST TOR ENGINEER GO AND VALIDATE THAT THOSE ARE TRUE WHETHER THEIRE NO SOLUTIONS NOW A PROTINE CAN BEFOLDED OR POSSIBLE STATES THAT A CELL COULD BE IN WHEN IT'S INTERACTING WITH OTHER THINGS BUT YOU WERE NOT YET AT THE STATE WITH A EYE THATYOU CAN JUST TAKE THE OUTPUTS OF THESE THINGS AS LIKE AS GOSPEL AND RUN FROM THERE BUT THAT THEY ARE VERY GOOD I THINK AS YOU SET HYPOTHESIS GENERATORS OR I'M POSSIBLE SOLUTION GENERATORS THAT THEN YOU CAN GO VALIDA SO AND  THAT'S VERY POWERFUL I'M THING THAT WE CAN BASICALLY IN BUILDING ON THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF SCIENCE WORK AROUND THE HUMAN CELL ATLAS ANDALL THE DATA THAT'S BEEN BUILT OUT CARRY THAT FORWARD INTO SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY NOVEL TOOL GOING FORWARD IM AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF THING THAT I THINK WE'RE SET UP TO DO WELL I MEAN YOU ALL YOU HAD THIS EXCHANGE OF A LITTLE WILE BACK ABOUT 'M OU FUNNING LEVELS AND HOW SEASY EYAS YOU'RE JUST  SORT OF A DROP IN THE IN THE IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO AN I ACH BUT I THINK WEWE HAVE THIS TTHE THING THAT I THINK WE CAN DO THAT'S DIFFERENT IS 'M FUNDING SOME OF THESE LONGER TERM BIGGER PROJECTS THAT IT IS HARD TO GALVANIZE THE IN PULL TOGETHER THE ENERGY TO DO THAT AN IT'S A A LOT OF WHAT 'M MOST SCIENCE FUNNING IS IS LIKE RELATIVELY SMALL PROJECTS THAT ARE EXPLORING THINGS OVER RELATIVELY SHORT TIME HORIZONS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TRY TO DO IS IS LIK BUILD THESE TOOLS OVER IN FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEAR PERIODS THERE ROFTEN PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FUNDING AND WORLD CLASS ENGINEERING TEAMS AND INFOR STRUCTURE TO DO AND THAT I THINK IS A PRETTY COOL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD THAT IM THAT I THINK IS THERE AREN'T AS MANY OTHER FOLKS WHOAR WHOARE DOING THAT KIND OF THING BUT THAT'S ONE THEREASONS WHY I'M PERSONALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE VIRTUAL SELL STAFF CAUSE IT JUST IT'S LIKE THE PERFECT INTERSECTION OF ALL THE STUFF THAT WE'VE DONE AND SINGLE SELL A PREVIOUS I'M COLLABORATIONS THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE FIELD AND A BRING TOGETHER THE THE AM INDUSTRY AND AN A IEXPERT HEIS ROUND THUS I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THE MODEL OF ISCIENCE THAT YOU'RE PUT TOGETHER WITH SEASY EYE IS ISN'T JUST UNIQUE FROM AN AGE BUT IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AT THE IM INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATEOR MODEL IS WHAT'S DRIVEN THE PROGRESSION OF SCIENCE IN THIS COUNTRY AND TO SOME EXTEND IN NORTHERN EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEA ERS IN ITS UM WONDERFUL UM ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR THAT IMAGE WE HAVE OF A SCIENTIST KIND OF TINKERING AWAY OR THE PEOPLE IN THEIR LAVIN THAN THEY UREAK US UM AN THAT HOPULLY TRANSLATES TO BETTER HUMAN HEALTH U BUT I THINK IN MY OPINION WE'VE MOVE PAST THAT MODEL AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MODEL OR THE ONLY MODEL THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED I JUS THINK IT'S ABALANCE IT TAT NOWF WHAT YOU WANT AT OU WANT TAT BOT YOUN AR THOWR THOS PEOPLE I THINK TAT THAT'S THESE TOOLS OF SOWERS AND THEIR MECHANISMS TO DO THAT LIKE AN H BUT BUT IT'S HARD UM TO DO CLABORATIVE SCIENCE IS UM IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE NOT FAR FOR BECAUSE I GER UPRIGHT NEAR HERE AS WELL M NOT FAR FROM THE GARAGE MODEL OF TAC RIGHT HE'LL A JACKARD MODEL UM NOT FAR FROM HERE AT ALL UM AND THE IDEAS THAT OU KNOW THE TINKERER IN THE GARRAGE THE INVENTOR AND THEN PEOPLE OFTEN FORGET THAT TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY DISCOVERY TOOK ENORMOUS FACTORIES IN WHERE HOUSE SO UM YOU KNOTHERS THERE'S SIMILAR THERE TO FACE BOOK META ET CETERA BUT I THINK IN SCIENCE WHATWE IMAGINE THAT THE SCIENTISTS ALONE IN THEIR LABORATORY AND THOSE YOU REACOMMOMENTS BUT I THINK NOWADAYS THAT THE BIG QUESTIONS REALLY REQUIRE UM EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION AND CERTAINLY TOOL DEVELOPMENT UM AND ONE OF THE TOOLS Y KEEP COMING BACK TO AS THESE ELILEMS THESE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AND UM THEY YE COUL JUST ELABORATE FOR FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WHAT IS A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL UM IT FOR THAT THE THE UNINFORMED UTWHAT IS IT UM AND WHAT IS ALLOW WHAT IS ALLOW US TO DO THAT UM YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF OTHER TYPES OF A I DON'T ALLOW IM WHAT MORE IMPORTANTLY PERHAPS WAS ALLOW US TO DO THAT A BUNCH OF REALLY SMART PEOPLE HIGHLY INFORMED IN A GIVEN ARY OF SCIENCE STARING AT THE DATA WHAT CAN DO THAT THEY CAN'T DO SURE SO I THINK A LOT OF THE PROGRESSION OF MACHINE LEARNING HAS BEEN ABOUT BUILDING SYSTEMS NURL NATWORKS ARE OTHER WIVES THAT CAN BASICALLY MAKE SENSE AND FINE PATTERNS AND LARGER AND LARGER AMOUNTS OF DATA AND THERE'S A BREAK THROUGH A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK AM THAT SOME FOLKS AT GOUGLE ACTUALLY MAY IT CALL THIS TRANSFORMER MODEL ARCHITECTURE AND IT WAS THIS HUGE BREAK THROUGH BECAUSE BEFORE THEN THERE WAS SOMEWHAT OF A CAP WHERE IN IF YOU FED MORE DATA AND TO A NURRL NETWORK PASS SOME SOME POINT IT DIDN'T REALLY GLEAN MORE INSIGHTS FROM IT WHERE'S TRANSFORMERS JUST AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE END OF HOW BIG THAT CAN SCALE TO YET I MEAN IT I THIN THAT THERE'S A CHANCE THAT WE RUN INTO SOME SOME CEILING BUT IT WET NEVER ASK SOME DOTES WE WE HAVEN'T OBSERVED IT YET BUT WE JUST HAVEN'T BUILT BIG ENOUGH SYSTEMS YEN SO I WOULD GUESS THAT A AH NO IN THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY OE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS AND IN THE A I FALLED TO DAY IS BASICALLY OUR TRANSFORMERS AND AR THE CURRENT MODEL ARCHITECTURE SUFFICIENT IF YOU JUST BUILD LARGER AND LARGER CLUSTERS DO EVENTUALLY GET SOMETHING THAT SIKE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE OR SUPERINTELLIGENCE OR M IS THERE'S SOME KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL LIMIT TO THIS ARCHITECTURE THAT WE JUST HAVEN'T REACHED YET AND ONCE WE WE CANNAT GET A LITTLE BIT FURTHER IN BUILDING THEM OUT THAT WE'LL REACH THAT THAT WE'LLNEED A FEW MORE LEAPS BEFORE WE GET TO IN THAT THE LEVEL OF OF A A IY THAT I THINK WE'LL UNLOCK IN A TON OF REALLY FUTURISTIC IN AMAZING THINGS BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT EVEN JUST BEING ABLE TO PROCESS THE AMUNT OF DATA THAT WE CAN NOW WITH THIS MODEL ARCHITECTURE AM HAS UNLOCKED A LOT OF NEW USECASES AN THE REASON WHYTHER CALLED LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST USES OF THEM IS AM PEOPLE BASICALLY FEED IN ALL OF THE LANGUAGE FROM A BASKE OF THE WORLD BY WEB AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THEM AS BASICALLY PREDICTION MACHINES SO IF YOU YOU YOU FIT IN AM YOU PUT IN PROMPT AND IT KIN BASICALLY IU A PREDICT I VERSION OF WHAT SHOULD COME NEXT SO IN A YOU LIKE TYPE IN A HEADLINE FOR A NEW STORY IN IT CAN ON A PREDICT WHAT IT THINKS THE STORY SHOULD BE OR YOU COULD TRAIN IT SO THAT IT COULD BE A CHAT POT RIGHT WHERE IF IF YOU'RE PROMPTED WITH THIS QUESTION YOU CAN GET'THIS RESPONSE BUT ONEOF THE INTERESTING THINGS IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S ACTION NOTHING SPECIFIC TO USING HUMAN LANGUAGE IN IT SO IF INSTEAD OF FEEDING IT HUMAN LANGUAGE IF YOU USE THAT MODEL ARCHITECTURE FOR FOR A NETWORK AND INSTEAD YOU FEED IT ALL OF THE HUMAN SELL OUTLESS DATA THEN IF YOU PROMPT IT WITH A STATE OF A CELL IT CAN SPIT OUT I DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF OF LIKE WHAT YOU KNOW HAVE THAT SELL CAN ATTRACT OR DIFFERENT STATES THAT THE CELL COULD BE A NEXT WHEN IT INTERACTS WITH DIFFERENT THINGS DOES IT HAPT TO TAKE A JUNEICS CLASS OPERINCES IF YE GIVE IN A BUNCH AT YOU NOIS NOT IT YOU HAVE TO SAY BY THE WAY AND THEN YOU GIVE IT JUNES CLASS TO IT UNDERSTANDS THA OUDA YOU GET D'ANA RNA M RNA AND PROTINE NI THINK THAT THE MASIC THE BASIC NATURE OF ALL THESE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IS THERE THEY'RE BASICALLY PATTERN RECOGNITION SYSTEMS SO THE'RE THESE LIKE VERY DEEP STATICTICAL MACHINES IM THE'RE VERY EFFICIENT AT FINDING PATTERNS M SO IT'S IT'S NOT ACTUALLY AND YOU DON'T NEED TO TEACH A A LANGUAGE MODEL THAT'S TRYING TO YOUST SPEAK A LANGUAGE AM A LOT OF SPECIFIC THINGS ABOUT THAT LANGUAGE EITHER YOU JUST FEEDET IN A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES AND THEN OU'LL LET SAY YOU TEACH IT ABOUT SOMETHING IM IN ENGLISH BUT THEN YOU ALSO GIVE IT A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE SPEAKING ITALIAN IM IT'LL CTUALLY BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE THING THAT IT LEARNED AN ENGLISH AN ITALIAN RIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT IS SO THATTHE CROSS OVER IN JUST A PATTERN RECOGNITION AM IS THE THING THAT IS PRETTY PROFOUND AND POWERFUL ABOUT THIS BUT IT REALLY DOES APPLY TO A OT OF DIFFERENT THINGS ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AM HAS BEEN THE WORK WORK THAT ALPHOPHOLD YOU KNOW THAT THE BASICALLY THE O THE FOKS A DEEP MINED HAVE DONE IM ON PROTINE FOLDING M IT'S YOU NOR JUST BASICALLY A LOT OF A THE SAME MODEL ARCHITECTURE BUT INSTEAD OF LANGUAGE THERE THEY FOLDED THAT THEY CONOFET IN ALL THE THE PROTINE DATA ANDYOU CAN GIV IT A STATE AND IT CAN SPIT OUT SOLUTIONS TO OU THOSE PROTINES GET FOLDED SO IT'S VERY POWERFUL I DON'T THINK WE KNOW YET IS AN INDUSTRY WHAT THE A WHAT THE NATURAL LIMITS OF IT ARE AND THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE BUT A IT CERTAINLY ALLOWS YOU TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT JUST WOREN'T SOLVED WITH THE GENERATION OF MACHINE LEARNING THAT CAME BEFORE IT SOMTLI CISIEY IS MOVING A LOT OF WORK THAT WAS JUST DONE IN VITRO IN DISHES AM AN IN VIVO IN A LIVING ORGANISMS MODEL ORGANISMS ARE HUMANS TO INSILICO AS WE SAY SO AM DO YU FORESEE A FUTURE WE'RE A LOT OF BYMEDICAL RESARCH CERTAINLY THAT THE WORK OF SISI I AM INCLUDED IS DONE BY MACHINES I BEAN OBVIOUSLY ITS MUCH LOWER COST A AN YOU CAN RUN MILLIONS OF EXPERIMENTS WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT TO SAY THAT HUMANS ARE NOT GOING TO BE INVOLVED EM BUT I LOVE THE IDEA THAT WE CAN RUN EXPERIMENTS IN SYLICO A EN MASS I THINK THE IN SELCAL EXPERIMENTS ARE GIINME INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO TESS THINGS QUICKLY TIT CHEAPLY INTO A TIS JUST UNLECIALLOT OF CREATIVITY I DO THINK YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT MAKING THRUNTS TILL TRANSLATES AND MATCHES THIS  HUMANS AM YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT'S FUNNY IN A BASIC SIENCES WE'VE VASICALLY CURED EVERY SINGLE DISEASE IN MICE LIKE MICE HAVE A WE WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF DISEASES BECAUSE THER WERE THEIR USE AS MODEL ORGANISM BUT THEY ARE NOT HUMANS IN A LOT OF TIEMS THAT RESEARCH IS RELEVENT BUT NOT DIRECTLY ONE TO ONE TRANSLATABLE TO HUMANS SO YOU JUST HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR HUMANS SOMETHY WHAT CISI EYIS DOING AS ITUALLY CREATING A NEW FIELD C I AS I'M HEARING ALL THIS SOMETHING  HI THIS THIS TRANSCENDS IMENOLOGY DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW CARDAU ERACIC SURGERY  A ME NARROW SCINES OTHE IDEA OF A NEW FIELD WHERE YOU CERTAINLY EMBRACE THE REALITIES OF UNIVERSITAS IN LABORATORIES BECA HAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE WORK THAT YOUR FUNNING IS DONE IS AT RIGHT IS TSO UM MAYBE WE NEED THINK ABOUT WHAT IT ME INSTITDUE SCIENCE DIFFERENTLY AND I THINK THAT'S ONE O O THINGS THAT'S MOST EXCITING UM ALONGMOST LINES IT SEEMS AT BRINGING TOGETHER A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE DIFFERENT A MAJOR INSTITUTIONS UM IS IT GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SO I KNOW THAT THE INITIAL SEE SE IBIOHUB UM GRATEFULLY UMINCLUDED STAMFORD UM WE'LL PUT THAT FIRST IN THE LIST UM BUT ALSO YOU SEE US OGH YE FORGIVE ME THE MANY FRIENDS THAT YOU SEE US AT AND ALSO BURGLY UM BUT THERE ARE NOW SUM ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED SO MAYBE YOU TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT MOTIVE ADE THE DECISION TO BRANCH OUTSIDE THE BAY AREA AND UM AND WHY YOU SELECTED THOSE PARTICULAR ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO BE INCLUDED WHAM A'LL A'LL DESCI PART OF A BIG PART OF WHY WE WANTED TO CRITIDITIONAL BIOHUBS AS WE WERE JUST SO IMPRESSED BY THE WORK THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE RUNNING THE FIRST BIOHUB DID AM AND I ALSO THINK AND YOU SHOULD WALK THROUGH THE THE A WORK OF THE  CHICAGO BIOHUB AND THE NEW YORK BIOHUB THAT WE JUST ANNOUNCED BUT I THINK IT'S ACTIAL AN INTERESTING SET OF EXAMPLES THAT BALANCE AM THE LIMITS OF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH LIKE PHYSICAL MATERIAL ENGINEERING AND AND IM AND AND WHERE THINGS ARE PURELY BIOLOGICAL BECAUSE THE CHICAGO TEAM IS REALLY BUILDING MORE CENSORS TO FUIL T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON YOUR BODY BUT THAT'S MORE LIKE A PHYSICAL CON OF ENGINEERING CHALANGE WHERE IS THE THENW YOR TEAM WE MASTLY TALK ABOUT THIS IS LIKE A CELLULAR ENDOSCOPE OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE A LECANAMUNECELLAR SOMETHAT CAN GO AND UNDERSTAND A IN WHAT IS LIKE WHAT'S A THING THAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY BUT IT'S NOT LIKE A PHYSICAL PIECE OF HARDWORDS A SELL THAT WHAT YOU CAN BASICALLY AM OU HAVE HAVE AM AJISCOPE REPORT OUT ON ON ON  DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE OPENING INSIDE THE BODY SID  SO ASION TO CELL THE MICROSCOPE TO A LAN AN AN AN AEVENTUALLY ACTUALLY BEING UP TO ACT ON IT BUT I MEAN BUT YOU SHULD YOU SHALL GOING TO HAVE MORE YOU TELL ON ALL THIS SO COURT PRINCIPLE OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT BILEHUBS IT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE A A WHEN WE INVITED PROPOSALS IT HAS TO BE AT LEAST THREE INSTITUTIONS A SO REALLY BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIER OF A SINGLE UNIVERSITY OFTENTIMES ASKING FOR THE PEOPLE DESIGNING THE RESEARCH AIM TO COME FROM ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS A AND TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT THE PROBLEM THAT THEY WANT US ALL A REQUIRES INTER DISCIPLINARY INSINTER UNIVERSITY INSTITUTION COLLOBORATION TO ACTUALLY MAKE HAPPEN A WE JUST PUT THAT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OUT THERE A WITH OUR SAN FRANCISCO BIAHUB AS AN EXAMPLE WHERE THEY'VE DONE INCREDIBLE WORK IN SINGLE CELL BIOLOGY AND INFECTUOUS DISEASE AND WE GOT I WANT TO SAY LIKE FIFTY SEVEN PROPOSALS FROM OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY INSTITUTIONS A LOT OF IDEAS CAME TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW WE'RE SO SO EXCITED THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO LAUNCH CHICAGO AND NEW YORK A CHICAGO IS A CLABORATION BETWEEN YOU I YOU SEE A UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS A RANA CHAMPAGNE AND UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN A EFI OBVIOUSLY THESE UNIVERSITIES ARE MULTIFACITED BUT IF I WERE TO STRIPT DESCRIBE THEM BY THEIR LIKE STER TYPICAL STRENGTH NORTH WESTERN HAS AN INCREDIBLE MEDICAL A A SYSTEM AND HOSPITAL SYSTEM UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BRINGS TO THE TABLE INCREDIBLE BASIC SIEN STRENGTH A UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS IS A COMPUTING POWER HOUSE AND SO THEY CAME TOGETHER AND PROPOSED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO STAR THINKING ABOUT CELLS IN IN TISSUE A SO THAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE LAYERS THAT YOU JUST ALLUDED TOE SO HOW DO THE CELLS THAT WE KNOW BEHAVE AT ACT DIFFERENTLY WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER AS A TISSUE IN THE FURT ONE OF THE F RST TISSUES THAT THEYR STARTING WITH I SKIN SO THEY'VE BEEN ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO UM IS A COLLABORATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SHANAKELLY DESIGN UM ARTAA ENGINEERD SKIN TISSUE THE ARCHITECTURE LOOKS THE SAME AS WHAT'S IN YOU AND I AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS BUILT THESE TI SUPERSUPERTHIN CENSORS AND THEY IN BED THESE CENSORS UM THROUGHOUT THE LAYERS OF THIS ENGINEER TISSUE AND THEY READ OUT THE DATA THEY WANT U SEE HOW THESE CELLS WHAT THESE CELLS ARE SECRETING HOW THESE CELLS TALK TO EACH OTHER IN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE CELLS GET AND FLAMED UM INFLAMMATION IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PROCESS THAT DRIVES FIFTY PER CENT OF ALL DEBTS UM AND SO THIS IS ANOTHER SORT OF DISEASE AGNOSTIC APPROACH WE WANT A UNDERSTAND INFLAMMATION AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET A TON OF INFORMATION OUT FROM THESE CENSORS THAT TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMETHING GOES ARY CAUSE RIGHT NOW WE CAN SAY LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE AN ELERGIC REACTION YOUR SKIN GETS RED AND PUFFY BUT WHAT IS THE EARLIEST SIGNAL OF THAT AND THESE CENSORS CAN LOOK AT THE BEHAVIORS OF THESE CELLS OVER TIME AND THEN YOU CAN APPLY A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL TO LOOK AT THE EARLIEST STITISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO INTERVENE UM AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THAT'S WHAT CHICAGO'S DOING THEI'RE STARTING IN THE UM ASKIN CELLS THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE NURW MUSCULAR JUNCTION UM WHICH IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WERE A NURON A ATTACHES TO A MUSCLE AND TELLS THE MUSCLE HOW TO BEHAVE SUPERIMPORTANT IN THINGS LIKE AIL US BUT ALSO IN AGING UM THE SLOWED TRANSMISTION OF INFORMATION ACROSS THAT NUR MUSCULAR JUNCTION IS WHAT CAUSES OLD PEOPLE TO FALL THEYR BRAIN CANNOT TRIGGER THEIR MUSCLES TO RACT FAST ENOUGH AND SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO EMBED THESE CENSORS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE DIFFERENT UM AINTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS WITHIN OUR BODIES WORK TOGETHER IN NEW YORK A THEY'R DO ING A A RELATED ABUT AN EQUALLY EXCITING PROJECT WHERE THERE AM ENGINEERING INDIVIDUAL CELLS TO BE ABLE TO AM GO IN IN IDENTIFY CHANGES IN A IN A HUMAN BODY SO AM WHAT THEY'LL DO IS A THEY'RE CALLING A IT'S A YOW TET MAO O MAN ITS THIS IS I DONLY GO ON A TANGEBUT FOR THOSE THAT WANT TA LOOKAT UP ADAPTIF OBJECTS YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF I DISTORTION AND INTERFERENCE WHEN YOU TRY ND LOOK AT SOMETHING REALLY SMALL OR REALLY FAR AWAY AND REALLY SMART PHYSICIS A FIGURE DOUT WHELL USE THE INTERFERENCE AS PART OF THE MICROSCOPE MAKE THOSE ASHY LENSES OF THE MICROSCOPE SO TALK ABOUT IMMA YOUNG SEPERA SO  OW IS IS HAT A ME HA THAT IN YOUR SPIITS EXTREMELY CLEVER ALONG THOSE LINES IT'S NOT INTUITIVE BUT THAN WHEN YOU HEAR IT IT'S LIKE IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY INTO ITIV ITMAKE THE CELLS THAT ARE ALREADY TO NAVIGATE TO TISSUES OR IN BED THEMSELVES AN TISSUES BE THE MICROSCOPE WITHIN THAT TOLARLY E LOVE IT A THE THE THE WAY THAT I EXPLAIN THIS TO MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY IS THIS THIS FANTASTIC VOYAGE BUT REAL LIFE AM LIKE WE 'RE GOING INTO THE HUMAN BODY AND WE'RE USING THE MEAN CELLS WHICH YOU KNOW ARE PRIVILEGED AND ALREADY WORKING TO KEEP YOUR BODY HEALTHY AND BEING ABLE TO TARGET THEM TO EXAMINE CERTAIN THINGS SO LIKE YOU CAN ENGINEER IN A MEAN CELL TO GO IN YOUR BODY AND LOOK INSIDE YOUR CORINARY ARTERIES AND SAY ARE THESE ARDERIES AM HEALTHY ORARE THEIR PLACKS CAUSE BECAUSE PLACKS LEAD TO BOCKAGE WHICH LEAD TO HART ATTACKS A AND THE CELL CAN THEN RECORD THAT INFORMATION AND REPORT IT BACK OUT THAT'S THE FIRST TALF WHAT THE NEROPILE HAVE IS GOING TO DO THE SECOND HALF IS CAN YOU THEN ENGINEER THE CELLS TO GO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT CAN I THEN TELL A DIFFERENT CELL I MEAN CELL THAT IS ABLE TO TRANSPORT IN YOUR BODY TO GO IND AND CLEAN THAT UP IN A TARGETED WAY AND A SO IIT'S INCREDIBLY EXCITING THEY'RE GIN A STUDY THINGS THAT ARE A SORT OF A MEAN PRIVILEGE THAT YOR MEAN SYSTEM NORMALLY DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A THINGS LIKE OVERIAN AMPANCRIATIC YANT SIR AM THEY'LL ALSO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF NARDEGENERIVE DISEASES INCE A THE MEAN SYSTEM DASN'T PRESENTLY HAVE A TON OF ACCESS INTO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ABUT THEY IT'S IT'S BOTH MINE BLOWING AND FEELS LIKE SIE PHI BUT SCIENCE AS ACTUALLY IN A PLACE WHERE A FEU REALLY PUSHED A GROUP OF INCREDIBLY QUALIFIED SCIENTIS SAY COULD YOU DO THIS IF GIVEN THE CHANCE THE ANSWERS LIKE PROBABLY GIVE US ENOUGH TIME THE BRIGHT TEAM AND RESOURCES LIKE S TUPIBLE AMND IT'S A A TENTIFIFT IN ER PROJECT YE BUT IT'S IT'S OSSIM ENGINEER ITSELS E II LOVE THE OPTIMISM AND AND THE MOMENT YOU SAID MAKE THE CELL THE MICROSCOPE SO SWE HILESS LIKE YES YES AND YES IT IT IT JUST MAKES SO MUCH SENSE WHAT WOULD AVE ADE THE DECISION TO DO THE WORK OF OF CSY EY  IN THE CONTECTS OF EXISTING UNIVERSITIES AY SUPPOSED TO YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL SOME REAL ESTATE UP IN REDWOOD CITY WHERE THERE'S A BUNCH OF SPACE TO PUT BY ATET COMPANIES AND JUST HIRING PEOPLE FROM ALL ALL BACKGROUNDS AND AND SAYING HEY YOU KNOW HAVE AT IT AND AND DOING THE STUFF FROM SCRATCH EMMING ITS  IT'S A VERY INTERESTING DECISION TO DO THIS IN THE CONTECTS OF AN EXISTING FRAME WORK OF LIKE GRADUATE TUDNTS THAT NEED TO DO E THESIS AND GET A FIRST AUTHOR PAPER ITIS ALL SET OF STRUCTURES WITH IN ACADAMIA THAT I THINK BOTH FACILITATE BUT ALSO LIMIT THE PROGRESSION OF SCIENCE NOW THAT INDEINDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR MODEL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A EARLIER IT IT'S SO CORD TO THE WY SCIENCE HAS BEEN DONE THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT AN FRANKLY SOUNDS FAR MORE EFFICIENT IF I'M TO BE TO COMPLETELY HONEST AND A YOU NO WE'LL SEE IF I RENEW MY IWN AGE FUNDING AERTIN WHAT AM BUT I THINK WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING WE ALL WANT IT AS SCIENTISTAN AND AS A YOU KNOW IT AS HUMANS WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE WAY WE WORK AND WE WANT AM HEALTHY A PEOPLE TO PERSIST TO BE HEALTHY AND WE WANT SICK PEOPLE TO GET HEALTHY I MAN THAT'S REALLY ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IT'S NOT SUPERCOMPLICATIS JUST HARD TO DO SO THE TEAMS AT THE B HUB ARE ACTUALLY AM INDEPENDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OT IT SO EACH BILEHOBWILL PROBABLY HAVE IN TOTAL MAY BE FIFTY PEOPLE WORKING ON SORT OF DEEP AFFRECTS HOWEVER IT'S IT AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT NOT ALL THE BASS SCIENTISTS WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AREA ARE ACTUALLY AM GOING TO ONE WANT TO LEAVE A UNIVERSITY OR WANT TO TAKE ON THE FULL TIME SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT SO IT'S THE ABILITY TO PARTNER WITH UNIVERSITIES A AND TO HAVE THE FACULTY AT ALL THE UNIVERSITIES BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVER AL PROJECT AM IS HOW THE BILEHA ISTRUCTURE COT IT BUT A LOT OF THE WAY THAT WERE APPROACHING SEES I IS THIS LONG TERM ITERATIVE PROJECT TO FIGURE OUT TRY ABUNCH A IFFERENT THINGS FIGURE OUT WHICH THINGS PRODUCE THE MOST INTERESTING RESULTS AND THEN DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE ER PUSH RIGHT SO WERE WE JUST WENT THROUGH THIS PERIOD WERE WE INHAVE WRAPPED UP THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE SCIENCE PROGRAMM WE TRT A LOT OF DIFFERENT MODELS OR IT ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND AM IT'S NOT THAT THE BIHUB MODEL WE DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE THE BEST OR ONLY MODEL BUT WE WE FOUND THAT IT WAS SORT OF A A A REALLY INTERESTING WAY TO UNLOCK A BUNCH OF COLLABORATION AND BRING SOME TECHNICAL RESOURCES THAT ALLOW FOR THIS LONGER TERM DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS WIDELY AM BEING PURSUED TO CROSS THE REST TO THE FIELDS WE FIGURE DTOCA THIS IS LIKE A AN INTERESTING THING THAT WE CAN THAT WE CANNOT PUSH ON BUT I I MEAN YET WEWE DO BELIEVE IN THE COLABORATION AM BUT I I ALSO THINK THAT WE COME AT THUS WITH IU WE DON'T THINK THAT THE WAY THAT WERE PURSUING THIS IS LIKE THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS OR THE WAY THAT EVERYONE SHOULD DO IT WE WERE PRETTY AWARE OF  NOT THAT AM IU WHAT IS THE REST OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND HOW WE CAN PLAY A UNIQUE ROLL IN IT FEELS VERY SENERGESTIC WITH THE WAY SCIENCE IS ALREADY DONE AND ALSO FILLS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANICHE THAT FRANKLY IT WASN'T FILLED BEFORE AM A LONG LORN S OF IMPLEMENTATION SO LET'S SAY AM YOURE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS COMBINED WITH IMAGING TOOLS AN A REVEAL THAT A PARTICULAR SET OF GENES I'M ACTING IN A CLUSTER A AM SET UP AN AN WORGAN CRASHLET'S SAY THE PANK THE PANKERS CRASH AS OF PARTIULAR STAGE OF A PANCREATIC CANSWER AM STILL ONE OFTHE MOST DEADLIES OF THE GV THE CANCERS AND AM I THE'RE OTHERS THAT YOU CERTAINLY WENT ONE AGET BUT THAT'S AMONG THE THE ONES YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO YET THE MOST SO YOU DISCOVER THAT THEN AND THE IDEAS THAT OOCAY THEN A E I REVEALS SOME PERTENTIAL DRUG TARGETS THEN BEAR OUT IN VETRO IN ADDITION IN A MOUSE MODEL AM HOW'S THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF TO DRUG DISCOVERY OR E IT MAY BE THIS TARGET IS DRUGABLE MAYBE IT'S NOT MAYBE IT REQUIRE SOME OTHER APPROACH YOU KNOW A LAZER LAZEROBLATION APPROACH OR SOMETHING WE WE DON'T KNOW BUT ULTIMATELY IS EASY I GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW THERAPUDIC IS AT THE IDEA I LESSO LA O A THAT'S YOU KNOW THIS IS WHERE IT'S IMPORTANGT TO WORK IN AN EGO SYSTEM AND TO KNOW YOUR OWN LIMITATIONS LIKE THERE ARE GROUPS AND START UPS AN COMPANIES THAT TAKE THAT AND BRING IT TO TRANSLATION VERY EFFECTIVELY I WOULD SAY THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE A SMALL WINDOW INTO THAT WORLD IS ACTUALLY ARE WORK WITH RARE DISEASE GROUPS A WEE WE HAVE A THROU RARES ONE PORTFOLIO FUNDED PATIENT ADVOCATES TO CREATE AM WHERE DISEASE ORGANIZATIONS WERE PATIENTS COME TOGETHER A AND A ACTUALLY POOL THEIR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE A THEY BUILD BIE REGISTRIES REGISTRIES OF THEIR NATURAL HISTORY AND THEYE BOTH PARTNER WITH  RESEARCHERS TO DO THE RESEARCH ABOUT THEIR DISEASE AND WITH A DRUG DEVELOPERS TO INCENTOVIE DRAG DEVELOPERS TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEY MAY MEED FOR THEIR DISEASE AND YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT RER DISEASES AREN'T RARE THEY'RE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND RARE DISEASES AND A COLLECTIVELY ANPACKED MANY MANY INDIVIDUALS AND I THINK THE THING THAT'S FROM A YET BASIC SCIENCE A PERSPECTIVE THEM INCREDIBLY FASCINATING THING ABOUT RARE DISEASES IS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY WINDOWS TO HOW THE BODY NORMALLY SHOULD WORK AND SO THEYARE OFTEN A MUTATIONS THAT WHEN AWHEN JEANS THAT WERE WHEN THEY ARE MUTATED CAUSE VERY SPECIFIC DISEASES BUT THAT TELL YOU HOW THE NORMAL BIOLOGY WORKS AS WELL NOUT IT SO YOU DISCUST BASICALLY THE THE GOALS MAJOR GOLLS INITIIVES OF THE SEASY EYE FOR THE NEXT SAY FIVE TO TEN YEARS UM AND THEN BEYOND THAT THE TARGETS WILL BE EXPLORED BY BOUT TET COMPANIES A DOLL GRAD THOSE TARGETS AND AND TASETHEMEN AND IMPLEMENT THEM THROUGALSO I THINK BEEN A COUPLE OF TEAMS FROM THE INITIAL BIOHUB THERE WERE INTEREST IN SPINNING OUT IDEAS THEY AN'T HAVE START UP SO NA THAT'S JUSIT'S EVEN THUGHIT'S NOT A THING THAT WE'RE GOIN A PURSUE BECAUSE AN WERE A PHILANTHROPY A WE WANTED A NAPLE THE WORK THAT GETS DONE TO BEAL TAT GET TURNED INTO COMPANIES AND THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE GO TAKE AND AND AND RUN TOWARDS TOWARDS BUILDING IN ULTIMATELY THERAPUTICS SO THAT THAT'SN'T THAT'S ANOTHERESOUND BUT THAT'S JUST THAT'S NOT A THING THAT WORKIN TO DO AOUT IT UM I GATHER YOU'RE BOTH OPTIMIS NO IS THAT PART OF WHAT BROUGHT YOU TOGETHER FREGIME FOR GET ISMUCHING TO A PERSONAL QUESTION BUT I LOVE THE OPTIMISM THEM THAT THAT IT SEEMS TO SIT AT THE ROOTE OF THE SEASY I I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE INCREDIBLY HOPEFUL PEOPLE BUT IT IT MANIFEST IN DIFFERENT WAYS BETWEEN THE TWO OF US YE WHULD YOU WOR HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR OPTIMISM WORSE AS MINE IT'S NOT A LOADED QUESTION UM I DON'T KNOW UM I MAN I THINK I'M MORE PROBABLY TECHNOLOGICALLY OPTIMI STIC ABOUT WHAT CAN BE BUILT AND I THINK YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR FOCUS AS IN AN ACTUAL DOCTOR 'M KIND OF HAVE MORE OF A SENSE OF HOW THAT SKIN OF EFFECT TO ACTUAL PEOPLE IN THEIR LIVES I'M WORS FOR ME IT'S LIKE I'MN A LOT OF MY WORK IT IS IN IT'S A WE TOUCH A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD IM AN THE SCALEESS SORT OF EMENSE TAN I THINK FOR YOU JUST LIKE IT'S  BEING ABLE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS WHETHER IT'S NO STUDENTS AT ANY THE SCHOOLS THAT YOU'VE STARTED OR ANY THE STUFF THAT WE'VE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE EDUCATION WORK WHICH ISN'T THE GOL HERE OR IUNO LI JUST BEING ABLE TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THAT WAY I THINK I'S THE THING THAT I'VE SEEN YOU BE SUPERPASSION ABOUT AN WAT TOS THAT DO YOU GREVE THAT CHARACTERISATION ON TRANT ON TRANA YET I AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S VERY FAIR AND I'M SORT OF GIGGLING TO MYSELF CAUSE IN A DATA DAY LIFE AS LIKE LIKE PARTNERS AR RELATIVE OPTIMISM COMES THROUGH AS A MARK JUST LIKE IS OVERLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HIS TIME MANAGEMENT AN WELL GET ENGROSSED IN INTERESTING IDEAS I'M LIKE AND HE'S LATE IM EVERY PHYSICIANS ARE VERY PONTUAL AND BECAUSE HE'S LATE I HAVE TO CHANNEL MARK IS AN OPTIMIST WHENEVER I'M WAITING FOR HASITA NICE I I ALLSTART USING THAT THAT'S WHAT I  ONT GOON I'M IN THE DRIVE WAY WITH THE KID'S WAITING FOR YOU I'M LIKE MARK S AN OPTIMIST AM AND SO HIS OPTIMISM TRANSLATES TO SOME TARDINIST WHEREAS I'M A SORT OF I'M LIKE HOTTEST WHAT'S HAS HOWISES CAN HAPPEN LIKE I'M IN A OPENATS PARSHEET AND WE KNOW STAR PUTTING TOGETHER PLAN AND LIKE A PUTTING PULLING TO YOT ALL THE PIECES CALLING PEOPLE TO A SORT OF LIKE BRING SOMETHING TO LIFE BUT IS IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES THAT IS OPTIMIS TEND TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND PESSIMISTS TEND TO BE RIGHT AND YAN I I THINK IT'S IT'S TRUE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF LIFE RIGHT LA WHO SAID A DID YOU SAY THAT MARKS TAI LIKE IT I DID NOT INVENT IT A WHY V IT TO YOU WILL PUT IT  JUST DOT YBU BUT I I DO THINK THAT THERE'S REALLY SOMETHING TO IT RIGHT IN THERE'S LIKE IF YOU'RE DISCUSSING ANY IDEA THERE'S ALL THESE REASONS WHY IT MIGHT NOT WORK AND SI I I THINK THAT AND THOSE REASONS ARE O PROBABLY TRUE THE PEOPLE ARE STATING THEM ARE YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME VALIDITY TO IT BUT THE QUESTION IS THAT IS THAT THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WAY TOF YOU THE WORLD AND YET I THINK I CROSS THE BORD AND I THINKF THE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO BE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AND GET THE MOST DONE A YOU CANNOT NEED TO BE OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING CAN GET DONE THAND WHY WOULD YOU GO WORK ON IT THE REASON I ASKD THE QUESTION IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THESE DAYS WE HEARE A LOT ABOUT YOU KNOW THE FUTURE IS LOOKING SO DARK IN THESE VARIOUS WAYS AND UM YOU HAVE CHILDREN SO YOU AVE FAMILIES AND UM YOU ARE A FAMILY EXCUSE ME AND AND YOU ALSO HAVE FAMILIES INDEPENDENTLY UM THAT ARE NOW MERGED BUT UM I LOVE THE OPTIMISM BEHIND THE EASY I BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU DO BEHIND ALL THIS ATHERE'S SORT A SET OF BIG STATEMENTS ON THE WALL ONE THE FUTURE CAN BE BETTER THAN THE PRESENT IN TERMS OF TREATING DISEASE MAYBE VEN YOU SAID ELIMINATING DISEASES ALL DISEASES LOVE THAT OPTIMISM UM AND THAT THERE'S ATTRACTABLE PATH TO DO IT INK WHAT WERE IN A BUT PUT LITTLE YOUR MONEY AND TIME AND ENERGY AND PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY AND A I BEHIND THAT AND SO U I HAVE TO ASK A WAS HAVING CHILDREN AUM A SIGNIFICANT UM MODIFIER IN TERMS OF YOUR YOUR VIEW OF THE FUTURE LIKE WILE THE YE HEAREALL THIS DOOMING GLOOM LIKE WHAT'S THE FUTURE GOING TO BE LIKE FOR THEM DID YOU SIT BACK AND THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE IF THERE WAS A FUTURE WITH NO DIS DESUS AM IS THAT THE FUTURE WE WANT OUR CHILDREN AND I MA NOT I'M VOTING A BIG GASP SO WHENE I CAN  WHEN I CN INDEBATE THAT AT ALL BUT WAS HAVING CHILDREN A SORT O AN INSPIRATION FOR THE CEASYI IN SOME WAY NO SO I THINK MY ANSWER TO THAT EM I WOULD DILE BACKWARDS FOR ME EM AND I'LL JUST TELL VERY BRIEF A STORY ABOUT MY FAMILY I'M THE DAUGHTER OF TINESE VENEMIES A REFUGES AMY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WERE BOAT PEOPLE IF YOU REMEMBER PEOPLE LEFT VEANOM DURING THE WAR IN THESE SMALL BOATS INTO THE SOUTH TYNASEE AND AM THE THERE WERE STORIES ABOUT HOW THESE BOATS WOULD SINK WITH WHOLE FAMILIES ON THEM AND SO MY GRANDPARENTS WHO BOTH HAT THE GRANDPARENTS WHO KNEW EACH OTHER DECIDED THAT THERE WAS A BETTER FUTURE OUT THERE AND THEY WERE WILLING TO TAKE A REST FOR IT A BUT THEY WERE AFRAID OF LOSING ALL THEIR KIDS I MY DAD IS ONE OF SIX MY MAMMA IS ONE OF TEN AND SO THEY DECIDED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING OUT THERE IN THIS BLEAK TIME AND THEY PARRED UP THEIR KIDS ONE FROM EACH FAMILY AND SENT THEM OUT ON THESE LITTLE BOATS BEFORE THE INNERNET BEFORE SELF PHOUNDS AND SAID WE'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE OW AND A THE KIDS WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF LIKE YOU KNOW TEN TO TWENTY FIVE SO YOUNG KIDS MY MY MAMM WAS A TEA NATURE THAT EARLY TEAM WHEN THIS HAPPENED A AND EVERY ONE MADE IT AND I GOT TO SIT HERE AND TALK TO YOU SO HOW COULD I NOT BELIEVE THAT LIKE BETTER IS POSSIBLE AND LIKE I HOPE TAT THAT' IN MY LIKE EPIGENETIC SOMEWHERE AN I CARRE THAT ON THAT IS A SPECTACULAR STORY ISN'T THAT WHILE IT IS SPECTACHOW CAN I BE A PESSIMIST WITH THAT I WANT IT AND I SO APPRECIATE THAT YOU BECAME A PHYSICIAN BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT BRINGING THAT OPTIMISM AND THAT EPIGONETIC UNDERSTANDING AND COGNE OF UNDERSTANDING AND EMOTIONAL UNDERSTANDING TO THE FIELD OF MEDICINE I SA I GRATEFUL TO IM THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THAT DECISION AND THEN YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK YOU DON'T REIVE I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT STORY BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WILD THAT FIELDS UNTIL YOU HAVE YOUR OWN CHILD NEARLY WELL I CAN'T EVEN I I REFUSE TO LET HER USE YOU KNOW GLASS BOTTLES O  I THAT Y O MY GOD LIKE THE RISK IN THE SORT OF WILLINGNESS OF MY GRANDPARENTS TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING BEGGER AND BETTER A IS JUST ASTOUNDING AND IT OLF AN OUR OWN CHILDREN SERT AVE GIVEN A SENSE OF URGENCY IN SOTALCULAR STORY AND OF YOU YOUR SENDING KNOWLEDGE OUT INTO THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND BRINGING KNOWLEDGE INTO THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND I LOVE THIS WILL IT WILL SEE ON THE OTHER SIDE I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL ALL COME BACK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT I A MARK UP YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNEATOG ABOUT DID HAVING KITS CHANGE YOUR WORLD OF YOU ANDIT'S R ENOUGH TO FEAT THAT IS  AOA THEY WERE ALSO YOUR CHILDREN SO  I E AE IO YOU GET I YET OM TO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE INTISPA SO HAVING CHILDREN DEFFROMY CHANGES YOUR TIME RISE AND SUNG THAT THAT'S ONE THING ASSU YOU JUST LIK OF THEREALL THESE THINGS THAT I THINK WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT FOR AS LONG AS WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER THAT YOU'RE VENTUALLY WANTING TO BUT TENASIK O OR HAVING KIS WE WE NEED TOLI GET ON THIS RIGHT SO I THERE SO IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE CHECKOLUS THE BABY CHECKOL US BEFORE THE FIRST AS LIKE THE PINGIS ING PER AV O I DARTOS OU THE IYE  TRULY LIKE SITTING IN THE HOSPITAL DELIVERY IM FINISHING EDITING THE LETTER THAT WE WERE GOING TO PUBLISHED IM TO ANNOUNCE THEM A WER WEN ATIS IN TE ATERATION IT WAS NOT WE REALLY WERE ADDITING THE FINAL DRAUGHT BIRTH SEESE R Y    S WELL IT'S IT'S IT AN INCREDIBLE INITIATIVE I'V IV BEEN FALLING IT SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND UM AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFU L AND EVERYONE IN THE FEELD OF SCIENCE AND I AV LANT A COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE FOLKS  FEELS THE SAME WAY AND AND THE FUTURE IS EVEN BRIGHTER FOR IT IT'S CLEAR AND THANK YOU FOR EXPANDING TO THE MIDWESTON AND NEW YORK AND UM WE'RE ALL VERY EXCITE TO SEE WERE ALL OF THIS GOES I SHARE IN YOUR OPTIMISM AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THINK YOU IKE YOU ILI HAREN'T ADO I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND THANK OUR SPONSOR

FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH MARK ZUKERBERG SLIGHT SHIFT OF TOPIC HERE YOU'RE EXTREMELY WELL KNOWN FOR YOUR ROLL IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT BUT BY VIRTUE OF YOUR PERSONAL INTERESTS AND ALSO WERE META TECHNOLOGY INTERFACES WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH YOU'RE STARTING TO BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH HEALTH WHETHER  YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT OM PART OF THATS BECAUSE THERE'S POSTFOOTAGE OF YOU ROLLING JUGITZY YOU WANT A JUGITZY COMPETITION RECENTLY IM YOU'RE DOING OTHER FORMS OF MARTIAL ARTS WATER SPORTS INCLY SURFING IN UM AND ON AND ON SO UM YOU'RE DOING IT YOURSELF BUT MAY WE COULD JUST START OFF WITH TECHNOLOGY AND GET THIS ISSUE OUT OF THE WAY UM FIRST WHICH IS IT I THINK MANY PEOPLE ASSUME THAT TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY TECHNOLOGY THAT INVOLVES A STR SCREEN SKIVES ME OF ANY KIND I'S GOING TO BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR HEALTH BUT THAT DOESN'T CESSARILY HAVE TO BE THE CASE SO COULD YOU UM EXPLAIN HOW YOU SEE TECHNOLOGY UM NESHING WITH INHIBITING OR MAYBE THEN PROMOTING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SURE I'M IN THINK THIS IS A A REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC IT'S AM YOU KNR THE RESEARCH THAT WE'VE DONE SUGGESTS THAT IT'S NOT LIKE ALL GOOD ORE ALL BAD I THINK HOW YOU'RE USING THE TECHNOLOGY HAS A BIG IMPACT ON WHETHER IT IS BISK DEPOSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR YOU AND EVEN WITHIN TECHNOLOGY EVEN WITHIN SOCIAL MEDIA THERE'S NOT CAN O ONE TYPE OF THING THAT PEOPLE DO I THINK AT ITS BEST YOUR FORMING I MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND YON THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT BASKALLY SUGGESTS THAT YOUKNWIT'S IT'S THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE AND A FRIENDSHIPS THAT CANNOT BRING THE MOST HAPPINESS AND IN OUR LIVES AND IT'S SOME LEVEL END UP EVEN CORRELATING WITH LIVING A LONGER AND HEALTHIER LIFE BECAUSE IN OF THAT KIND OF O GROUNDING THAT YOU HAVE IND COMMUNITY AND S A BEING IMPORTANT FOR THAT SO I'VE NO BAD ASPECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IS IM KNOW THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND  PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE EMPATHY FOR THEM IM COMMUNICATE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR LIFE EXPRESS THAT THAT'S GENERALLY POSITIVE THERE THERE ARE WAYS THAT IT CAN BE NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF A BAD INTERACTIONS THINGS LIKE BULLYON M WHICH WE CAN WE CAN TALK ABOUT PEXATORS A LOT THAT WE'VE DONE TO BASIC WE MAKE SURE THAT  PEOPLE CAN BE SAFE FROM THAT GIVE PEOPLE TOOLS AND GIVE KIDS IM AN BILDER TO HAVE THE RIGHT PARENTAL CONTROLS THAT PARENTS CAN OVERSEE THAT BUT THATS SORT OF THE INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE SIDE THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE OF OF ALL THIS WHICH I THINK OF IS JUST LIKE PASSIVE CONSUMPTION WHICH T IT IT'S BEST IM IT'S ENTERTAINMENT RIGHT AN ENTERTAINMENT IS AN IMPORTANT HUMAN THING TOO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT HAS QUITE THE SAME ASSOCIATION WITH THE LONG TERM WELL BEING IN HEALTH IM BENEFITS AS BEING ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE CONNECT WITH OTHER PEOPLE DOES IM AND I THINK OT IT'S WORST IM SOME OF THE STAFF THAT WE SEE ON LINE IM I THINK THESE DAYS A LOT OF THE NEWS IS JUST SO RELENTLESSLY NEGATIVE IM THAT IT'S JUST HARD TO IN A COME AWAY FROM AN EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU'RE IN A LOOKING AT THE NEWS FOR IN HALF AN HOUR AND LIKE FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE WORLD SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A MIX ON THIS IM I THNK THE MORE THAT SOCIAL MEDEAS ABOUT CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE IM AND THE MORE THAT WHEN YOU'RE CIND OF CONSUMING AND USING I'M THE MEDIA PART OF SOCIAL MEDIA 'M TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS THAT CAN ENRITUE AND CAN PROVIDE INSPIRATION OR EDUCATION AS UPPOSED TO THINGS THAT M IJUST LEAVE YOU WITH A MORE TOXIC FEELING THAT THAT SORT OF THAT THE BALANCE THAT WE TRY TA TO GET RIGHT ACROSS OUR PRODUCTS AND I THIN WERE PRETTY ALINED WITH THE COMMUNITY BECAS AT THE END OF THE DAY IN I  PEOPLE DON'T WANT A USE A PRODUCT AND COME AWAY FEELING BAD AND THERE'S ALLYT THE LOT THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IM VALUE IT ALOT O THESE PRODUCTS AND TERMS OF INFORMATION AND UTILITY BUT I GET'S AS IMPORTAT WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING A PRODUCT TO THNK ABOUT WHAT CIND OF FEELING YOU'RE CREATING WITH THE PEOPLE WHO USE IT IT WHETHER THAT'S CAN OF AN AESTHETIC SENSE WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING HARDWARE OR JUST CONE OF LIKE WHAT LIKE WHAT WHAT WHULD YOU MAKE PEOPLE FEEL AND GENERALLY PEOPLE DO'T WANT TO FEEL BAD RIGHT SO I I THINK WHEN YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WANT A IR SHELTER PEOPLE FROM BAD THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD BUT I I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT IN IT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE WANT A IUN A FOR US TO JUST BE CONT OF JUST SHOWING LIKE ALL THE SUPERNEGATIVE STUFF ALL DAY LONG A SWEETS WE WORK HARD ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IU A MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING CONNECT PEOPLE AS BEST AS POSSIBLE HELPING MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE GOOD TOOLS A TO BLOCK PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE BULLYING THEM OR HARASS THEM OR ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER FOLKS IN ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN DEFAULTS INTO AN EXPERIENCE WHERE THEY'RE EXPERIENCE AS PRIVATE WE HAVE LL THESE PARENTAL TOOLS A S THAT WAY YOUR PARENTS CAN CAN KINT OF UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THEIR CHILDREN IS UP TO AND IT ARE UP TO IN A GOOD BALANCE A AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE WE TRY TO GIVE PEOPLE TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR TIME A IND WE TRY TO GIVE PEOPLE TOOLS SO THAT OUN ARFUR FURTEIN AND IN YOU'RE CON OF STOCK IN SOME IN A LOOP OF OF JUST LOOKING AT ONE TYPE OF CONTENT WILL NODG YOU AND SAY HOW YOU'VE BEN LOOKING AT CONTENT OF THIS TYPE FOR A WHILE IKE HOW ABOUT SOMETING ELSE AND HERES HERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER EXAMPLES THING THAT THERE WARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO COUNT OF PUSH THIS IN A POSIT IVE DIRECTION BUT THINK IT JUST STARTS WITH HAVING A MORE NEW AUNTS TO VIEW IF LIKE THIS ISN'T ALL GOOD AND ALL OR ALL BAD AND THE MORE T YOU CAN MAKE IT CONT OF A POSITIVE THING THAT THE BETTER THIS WILL BE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE USE OUR PRODUCTS THAT MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE IN TERMS OF THE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE I AGREE I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE MOMENT I THINK WE'RE SOME PEOPLE GET CONCERNED PERHAPS NOTHING ABOUT MY OWN INTERACTIONS WOULD SAY INSTEGRAM WHICH I USE ALL THE TIME I'M FORGETTING INFORMATION OUT BUT ALSO CONSUMING INFORMATION AND I HAVPEN A LOV IT IT'S WHERE I ESSENTIALLY LAUNCH THE NON PODCAST AGMENT OF MY PODCAST AND CONTINUE TO I CAN THNK OF EXPERIENCES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT LIKE AM HIGHLY PROCESS FOOD WHERE IT TASTES GOOD AT THE TIME IT'S A IT'S HIGHLY ENGROSSING BUT IT'S NOT ENSARILY NUTRICIOUS AND YOU DON'T FEEL VERY GOOD AFTERWARDS YOT SO FOR ME THAT WOULD BE A MIGTY THE LITTLE COLLAGE OF DEFAULT EM OPTIONS TO CLICK ON AN ISTERGRAHM OCCASION I NOTICE AND THIS JUST REFLECTS MY FAILURE NOT INSTERGRAHAMS RIGHT THAT THEY'RE A LOT OF A LIKE STREET FIGHT THINGS LIKE OF PEOPLE BEATING PEOPLE UP ON THE STREET AND I HAVE TO SAY THESE HAVE A VERY STRONG GRAVITATIONAL PULL I'M NOT SOMEBODY THAT ENJOY SEEING VIOLENCE PERSAY BUT Y I FIND MYSELF AL CLICK AMON THSE LIKE WHAT HAPPENED AND I'LL SEE SO ONELIKE YOU NT GET HIT AND THAT IS LIABLE MAYLAY ON THE STREET OR SOMETHING AND THOUGH SEEM TO BE OFFER TO ME A LOT LATELY AND AGAIN THIS IS MY FAULT IT REFLECTS MY PRIOR SEARCHING EXPERIENCE BUT IT I NOTICE THAT IT HAS A BIT OF A GRAVITATIONAL PULL WHERE UM YOU KOW THERE'S I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING IT'S NOT THEACHING ME ANY KIND OF USEFUL STREET EM SELF DEFENSE SKILLS OF ANY KIND UM AND AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO REALLY ENJOY SOME OF T THE CUTE ANIMAL STUFF AND SO I GET A LOT OF THOSE ALSO SO THE JUST PULLAR  IS YOU KNO COLLAGE THAT'S OFFER TO ME THAT REFLECTS MY PRIOR SEARCH BEHAVIOR YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE THE ACUTE ANIMAL STUFF AM IS JUST ENTERTAINMENT BUT ACTUALY I THAT IT FILLS ME WITH A FEELING IN SOME CASES THAT TRULY DELIGHTS ME I DELIGHT IN ANIMALS WHERE N'T JDUST TIME MA KINS I MADE ANIMALS I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ANIMALS I'V NEVER SEE BEFORE THE TRULY DELIGHT ME THEY ENERGIZE ME IN A POSIVE WAY THAT WHEN I LEAVE INSTER GRAHAM I DO THINK I'M BETTER OFF SO I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OGAR OF THEM IN THAT SENSE BUT I GESS THE DIRECT QUESTION IS IS THE ALGRI THEM JUST REFLECTIVE OF WHAT ONE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT A LOT PRIOR TO THAT MOMENT WHERE THEY LOG ON OR IS IT ALSO TRYING TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU A DESCRIBED WHICH IS TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE A GOOD FEELING EXPERIENCE THAT LEADS TO MORE GOOD FEELINGS YE I MAY I THINK WE TRY TO DO THIS AN A LONG TERM WAY RIGHT I THINK ONE SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS WE HAVE THIS ISSUE A NUMBER OF YOUARS BACK ABOUT CLICKBATE NEWS RIGHT SO ARTICLES THAT WOULD HAVE AM ABASICALLY I A HEADLINE I BAT GRAD YOUR ATTENTION THAT MADE YOU FEEL IKE I NEED TO CLIC GON NEST THAN YOU CLICK ON IT AND IN THE ARTICLES ACTUALLY OUKNOW ABOUT SOMEHING THAT'S SOMEWHAT TANGENTIAL TO IT A BUT PEOPLE CLICKED ON IT SO V THE NAIVE VERSION OF THIS STAFF YOU KNOW THE LIKE TEN YEAR OLD VERSION IT'S A GO PEOPLE SEEM TO BE CLICKING ON THIS MAYBE THAT'S GOOD BUT IT'S ECTHOUL PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD EXERCISE TO INSTRUMENT THE SYSTEM TO REALIZE THAT EY PEOPLE CLICK ON THIS AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY DON'T REALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME READING THE THE NEWS THAT HAFTER CLICKING ON IT AND AM AFTER THEY DO THIS A FEW TIMES THEY I IT DOESN'T REALLY CORRELATE WITH THEM IN A SAYING THAT HERE AVING A GOOD EXPERIENCE  SOME OF WHAT YOU SOME OF HOW WE WE MEASURE THIS IS JUST BY LOOKING AT HOW PEOPLE USE THE SERVICES BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO BALANCE THAT BY HAVING LIKE REAL PEOPLE COME IN AND YOUN'T TELL US SO KI WWE WE SHOW THEM HEAR THE STORIES THAT WE COULD HAVE SHOWED YOU WHICH OF THESE AM ARE MOST MEANINGFUL TO YOU OR WOULD WOULD MAKE ITS THAT YOU HAVE THE BEST EXPERIENCE AND JUST KIND OF LIKE MAPPING THE ALGARITHEM IND WHAT WE DO TO THAT GROUND TRUTH OF WHAT PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY WANT SO I I THINK THAT THROUGH A SET OF THINGS LIKE THAT WE REALLY HAVE I MADE LARGE STEPS TO MINIMIZE THINGS LIKE CLICK BATE OVER TIME IT'S NOT GONE FROM THE INTERNAT BUT I THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF MINIMIZING IT ON ON OUR SERVICES WITHIN THAT THOUGH I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE PRETTY CAREFUL ABOUT NOT BEING PATERNALISTIC ABOUT WHAT MAKES DIFFERENT PEOPLE FEEL GOOD RIGHT SO MAN I DON'T KNOW THAT EVERYONE FEELS GOOD ABOUT ABO CUED ANIMALS ANN I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPL WOULD FEEL REALLY BAD ABOUT IT BUT MAY THEY DON'T HAVE AS PROFOUND IF A POSITIVE I REACTION TO IT AS AS AS YOU JUST EXPRESSED AM AND I N KNOW MAY BE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE INTO FIGHTING WOULD LOOK AT THE IN THE STREET FIGHTING VIDIOS SOME THAT TE'RE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITYS STANDARDS I THINK THAT THERE'S A LEVEL OF VIOLANCE THAT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO BE SHOWING AT ALL BUT THAT'S A A SEPARATE QUESTION AM BUT IF THEY ARE I MEAN THA OU KNO IKE MN A PRETTIENT EMAMA I N'T GET A LOT STREET FIGHTING VIDIOS BUT IF I DID MAYBE I I'D FEEL LIKE I WAS LEARNING SOMETHING FROM THAT AM I I THINK AT VARIOUS TIMES IN THE COMPANY'S HISTORY WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT TOO PATERNALISTIC ABOUT SAYING THIS IS GOOD CONTENT THIS IS BAD YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS 'M THIS IS UNHEALTHY FOR YOU AND I I THINK THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE LONG TO MEFACTS YOU DOT WAT TO GET STUCK IN IN A SHORT TERM LOOP OF LUCOKET JUST CAUSE YOU DID THIS TO DAY DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S LIKE WHAT YOU ASPIRE FOR YOURSELF OVER TIME BUT I THINK AS LONG AS YOU LOOK AT THE LONG TERM OF WHAT PEOPLE BOTH SAY THEY WANT AND WHAT THEY DO GIVING PEOPLE A FAIR AMOUNT OF LATITUDE TO LIKE THE THINGS THAT THEY LIKE II JUST THINK FEELS LIKE THE RIGHT SET OF VALUES TO BRING TO THIS IM NOWOF COURSETHAT DOES'T GO FOR EVERYTHING THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF TRULY OFFULIN ATS AND AND IN A THINGS THAT LIKE BULLYING FOR EXAMPLE OR OU THINGS THAT ARE REALLY LIKE INCITING VIOLENCE THINGS LIKE THAT AND WE HAVE A THE WHOLE COMMUNITY STANDARDS AROUND THIS BUT I THINK EXCEPT FOR THOSE THINGS WHICH I WOULD HOPE THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN AGREE YOR KAPT BULLYING IS BAD RIGHT I HOPE THAT INA HUNDRED PER CENT OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH THAT IN NOT A HUNDRED MAY BE NINETY NINE PER CNT I'M EXCEPT FOR THE THINGS THAT KIND OF GET BAD SORT OF VERY YOUTHAT THAT FEEL PRETTY EXTREME AND BAD LIKE THAT I THINK YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE SPACE TO LIKE WHAT THEY WANT ALIKE YESTERDAY I HAD THE A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE OF LEARNING FROM THE MEDITEEM ABOFT SAFETY PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE WERE KIDS WEARE USING A META PLATFORMS AND FRANK THA I WAS REALLY POSITIVELY SURPRISE AT THE HUGE NUMBER OF FILTER BASE TOOLS AND AND I JUST ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE THE EXPERIENCE SO THAT IT CAN I'M STAND THE BEST CHANCE OF ENRICHING NOT JUST REMAINING NEUTRAL BUT ENRICHING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH STATUS IM ONE THING THAT CAME ABOUT IN THAT CONVERSATION HOWEVER WAS I REALIZE THER ALL THESE TOOLS BUT DO PEOPLE REALLY KNOW THAT THESE TOOLS EXIST AND I THINK ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITHIN STERGAN MI I LOVE WATCHING TAMISSERIES FRIDAY UM CUANAYS BECAUSE HE EXPLAINS A LOT OF THE TOOLS THAT I DIDN'T NO EXISTED IUM AND  PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT HIGHLY RECOMMEND THT THEY WATCH THAT UM I I THINK EVERY TAKES QUESTIONS ON THURSDAYS AND ANSWERS AN MOST EVERY FRIDAYS UM SO IF I'M NOT AWARE OF THE TOOLS WITHOUT WATCHING THAT UM THAT EXISTS FOR ADULTS UM HOW DOES MET A LOOK AT THE CHALLENGE OF MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALL THESE TOOLS AN ME DOZENS AND DOZENS OF VERY USEFUL TOOLS BUT I THINK MOST OF US JUST KNOW THE HASH TAG THE TAG THE CLICK STORIES VERSES FEED  WE NOW NOT THAT YOU KNOT ALL SUPPOSE TO THREADS I MEANS T SO WE KNOW THE MAJOR CHANNELS AND TOOLS BUT UM THIS IS LIKE OWNING A VEHICLE THAT HAS INCREDIBLE FEATURES THAT ONE WHA DOESN'T REALIZE CAN TAKE YOU OFF ROAD CAN ALLOW YOUR VEHICLE TO FLY AT A LOT THERE SO A WHAT C WHAT YOU THINK OF BE DONE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT MAYBE THIS CONVERSATION COULD CU PEOPLE TO IVE THAT'S I PART PART O THE REASON WHY WANTED TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS AS I MEN I THINK MOST OF THE NARRATIVE AROUND SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT OOK AT ALL F THE DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO CONTROL THEIR EXPERIENCE ITS YOU KNOW THE KIND OF NARRATIVE OF IS THIS JUST NEGATIVE FOR FOR FORTEENS OR SOMETHING AND THEN I THINK AGAIN A LOT OF THIS COMES DOWN TO YOU KNOW TO IM YU KNOW HOW S THE EXPERIENCE BEING TUNED AND OIS IT ACTUALLY YOU LIKE OUR PEOPLE USING IT TO CONNECT AND IN POSITIVE WAYS AND IF SO I THINK IT'S REALLY POSITIVE AM SO YET I MAN I THINK PART OF THIS IS  PROJUS ME TO GET OUT AND TALK TO PEOPLE MORE ABOUT IT AM AND THEN THERE'S AN INPRODUCT ASPECT WHICH IS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A TEAN AN YOU SIGN UP WE TAKE YOU THROUGH A PRETTY M YOU'N EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE THAT IM TRIES TO OUTLINE SOME OF THIS BUT THAT IS LIMITS TO RIHTE BECAUSE WHN YOU SGN UP FOR A NEW THING IM IF YOU'RE BOMBARDED WITH MO CURES A LIST OF F OF FEATURES EI JUST SIGN UP FOR THE SOUND REALLY UNDERSTAND MUCH ABOUT WHAT THE SERVICES LIKE LET ME GO FIND SOME PEOPLE TO FOLLOW I'M WHO ARE MY FRIENDS ON HERE BEFORE I LIKE LEARN ABOUT CONTROLS TO AND PREVENT PEOPLE FROM HARASSING ME OR SOMETHING IM THAT'S WHY THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ALSO SHOW I A BUNCH THESE TOOLS IN CONTECT SO IN IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT COMENTS IM AND IN A FEW IF YOU GO TO IN O TO LEAD A COMMENT OR IM YOU GO TO ADD IT SOMETHING IN A TRY TO GIVE PEOPLE PROMPTS AND LINES IHEY DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN MANAGE THINGS ININ THESE WAYS I'M AROUND THAT OR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE IN BOX IND YOUR FILTERING SOMETHING RIGHT IT'S A REMIND PEOPLE IN LINE SO IKE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO USE THE PRODUCTS IN THE LEVEL OF NEW AUNTS SURROUND YOU TO THE CONTROLS I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF IM A THAT EDUCATION I THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE PRODUCT BUT I DO THINK THAT THROUGH CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS AND IN OTHERS THAT IN A WEET WE NEED TO BE DOING WE CAN CRED A BROADER A WARINESS THAT THOSE THINGS EXISTS THAT WAY AT LEAST PEOPLE ARE PRIMED SO THAT WAY WHEN THOSE THINGS POP UP IN THE PRODUCT PEPL LIKE O YE LIKE I I KNEW THAT THERE WIS THIS CONTROL AND LIKE YOURS HERE'S LIKE HOW I WOULD USE THAT LIKE I FIND THE RESTRICT FUNCTION TO BE VERY USEFUL UM MORE THAN THE BLOCK FUNCTION IN MOST CASES I'VE I DO SOME NIMES YEH YEU BUT THE RESTRICT FUNCTION IS REALLY USEFUL THAT YOU CAN FILTER SPECIFIC COMMENTS YOU KNOW SOME ONE MIGHT HAVE A YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT SOONE HAS A TENDENCY TO BE LILL AGGRESSIVE AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT I SHALLY DON'T REALLY MIND WHAT PEOPLE SAY TO ME BUT I TRY AD MAINTAIN WHAT I CALL CLASS ROOM RULES IN MY COMMENT SECTION WER I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE ATTACKING OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER TOLERATE THAT IN THE UNIVERSY CLASS ROOM OM NI CAN TOLERATE THEM IN THE COMMENT SECTION FOR INSTANCE YE AND I THINK THAT THE EXAMPLE TO YOU JUST YOU JUST USED ABOUT RESTRICT FIRST BLOCK GETS TO SOMETHING ABOUT PRODUCT DESIGN THAT'S IMPORTANT TOO WHICH IS THAT BLOCK IS SORT OF THIS VERY POWERFUL TOOL THAT IF SOME ONE IS GIVIN YOU A HARD TIME AN YOU JUST WANT THEM TO DISAPPEAR FROM THE EXPERIENCE YOU CAN DO IT BUT THE DESIGN TRAIT OFF WITH THAT IS THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SO THAT THE PERSON IS JUST GONE FROM THE EXPERIENCE 'M IN THAT THYOU DON'T SHOW UP TO THEM THEY DON'T SHO UP TO YOU AM INHERENT TO THAT IS THAT THEY WE'LL HAVE A SENSE THAT YOU BLOCKE THEM AND THAT'S WHY I THINK SOME STUFF LIKE RESTRICT OR JUST FILTERING LIKE I EDGED ON TO SEA IS MUCH STUFF ABOUT THIS TOPIC AM YOU PEOPLE LIKE USING DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR VERY SUBTLE REASONS RAIN MAYBE A MAYBYOU WANT THE CONTENT A NOT SHOW UP A BU YOU DON'T WANT THE PERSON WHO'S POSTING THE CONTENT TO KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WANT IT TO SHOW UP  MAYBOU DO'T WANT O GET THE MESSAGES IN YOU'R MAIN IN BOX BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL THE PERSOND THAT YOU U LIKE THAT YOU  ACTUALLY UNOWTHAT YOU'RE NOT FRIENDS OR SOMETHNG LIKE THAT A YYOU ACTUALLE TO GIVE PEOPLE DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OF KIND OF POWER AND NEW ANTS AROUND HOW THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS ARE IN USING THEM PLAY OUT AM IN ORDER TO REALLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO TAILOR THE EXPERIENTS AN THE WAYS THAT THEY WANT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO LIMIT TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME ON SOCIAL MEDIA IM I COULDN'T FIND REALLY GOOD DATA ON THIS IM YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TIME IS TOO MUCH I MEAN IT I THINK IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT ONE IS LOOKING OUT TTHE AGE OF THE USER ET CETERA YE MIGT LIKER I I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TOOLS THAT CUE A THE USEAR TO HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN ON A GIVEN PLATFORM ARE THEIRE TOOLS TO SELF REGULATE LIKE  THING ABOUT LIKE THE THE GREEKMITH OF THE SIRENS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE YOU'RE TYING THEMSELVES TO THE MAST AND COVERING THEIR EYES SO THAT THEY'RE NOT DRAWN IN BY THE SIRENS IS THERE A FUNCTION ASIDE FROM DELEADING THE AP TEMPORARILY AND THEN REINSTALLING IT EVERY EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO USE IT AGAIN IS THERE A TRUE LOCK OUT SELF LOCK OUT FUNCTION WHERE ONE CAN LOCK THEMSELVES OUT OF ACCESS TO THE AP WHY THINK WE GIVE PEOPLE TOOLS THAT LET THEM MANAGE THIS AND AND AND THERE'S THE TOOLS THAT YOU GET TO USE THEM THERE'S THE TOOLS THE PARENTS GET TO USE IM TO BASELY SEE HOW OVER US SUGE WORKS BUT YET I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT COUNT OF AND I THINK FOR NOW WE'VE MOSTLY FOCUSSED ON YOU' ELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS AND THEN YOUN'T GIVE PEOPLE REMINDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I'M IT'S TOUGH THOUGH TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOU WE'RE TALKIG OUT BEFORE THIS OF IS THERE AN AMOUNT OF TIME WHICH IS TOO MUCH IT DOES REALLY GET TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT IF YOU FAST FORWARD BE ONJUST THE APSE THAT WE HAVE TO DAY TO AN EXPERIENCE THAT IT AS LIKE A SOCIAL EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE OF THE AUGMENTED REALITY GLASSES OR SOMETHING THAT THAT WERE BUILDING A LOT OF THIS IS GOIN O BE YOU'RE INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE A IN THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD PHYSICALLY AS IF YOU WERE KIND OF LAKEHANG OUT WITH FRIENDS ORE WORKING WITH PEOPLE A BUT NOW THEY CAN SHOW UP AS TOLEGRAMS AND YOU CAN FEEL AT YOUR PRESENT RIGHT THERE WITH THEM I NO MATTER WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE AND THE QUESTION IS IS THERE TOO MUCH TIME TO SPEND INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT WELL AT THE LIMIT IF WE CAN GET THAT EXPERIENCE TO BE CAN OVE AS RICH AND GIVING YOU AS GOOD OF A SENSE OF PRESENCE AM AS YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WERE PHYSICALLY THERE WITH SOME ONE THEN I DON'T SEE WHY YOU WOULD WANT A RESTRICT THE AMOUNT THAT PEOPLE USE THAT TECHNOLOGY TO ANY LESS THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE O AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU'D BE COMFORTABLE INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE PHYSICALLY AM WHICH OVICES NOT TO BE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY YOU HAVE TO YOU HATHER STUFF IM YOU  WORK AN EET TO SLEEP BUT II THINK IT REALLY GETS TO CON OF HOW YOU'RE USING THESE THINGS WHEREAS IF WHAT YOU'RE PRIMARILY USING THE SERVICES FOR IS TO YOU SAY YOUARE GETTING STUCK AND LOOPS READING YOUR NEWS OR SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY KIND OF GETTING YOU INTO A NEGATIVE MENTAL STATE THEN I DON'TKNOW I MEAN I THINK THAT HERE'S PROBABLY A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT MAY BE THAT'S CAN OF A GOOD THING THAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING A BUT AGAIN EVEN THEN IT'S NOT ZERO RECON THAT IT'S IT'S ET' JUST CAUSE NEWS MIGHT MAKE YOU UNHAPPY DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE ANSWER IS TO BE UNAWARE OF NEGATIVE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD I JUST THINK THAT THERE WAS LIKE DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT TOLERANCES FOR WHAT THEY CAN TAKE ON THAT A I THINK WE IN IT'S GENERALLY HAVING SOME AWARE NECESS PROBABLY GOOD AS LONG AS IT'S NOT MORE THAN YOU'RE CON OF CONSTITUTIONALLY ABLE TO TAKE O I DON'T NOW I TRO TO NOT BE TO PATERNALISTIC ABOUT THIS THIS HOUR APPROACH BUT WE WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE BYK YOUIG THEM THE TOOLS BOTH PEOPLE AND IF YOU'RE ATEN YOUR PARENTS TO HAVE TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCANG AN AND WHAT THE IM AN HOW YOU'RE USING THESE THINGS IN THAND AND I GO FROM THERE I THINK IT REQUIRES OF ALL OF US SOME DEGREE OF SELF REGULATION I LIKE THES IDEA OF NOT BEING TOO PATERNALIST IC COMIN THAT'S I SEEMS AT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO I FIND MYSELF OCCASIONALLY HAVING TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M NOT JUST PASSIVELY SCROLLING THAT I'M LEARNING I LIKE FORGING FOR ORGANIZING AND DISPERCING INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN MY MMY LIFE'S CAREER SO I I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM SOCIAL MEEDING I FIND GREAT PAPERS GREAT IDEAS I THINK COMMENTS ARE A REAT SOURCE OF FEED BACK AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THATCAUSE YOU'RE SITTING HERE I MEAN IT IT'S DREAM IN PARTICULAR BUT OTHER METAL PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL FOR ME TO GET SCIENCE IN HEALTH INFORMATION OUT ONE OF TINKS THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WHICH I ONLY HAD THE CHANCE TO TRY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO DAY IS YOUR NEW AVIAR PLATFORMS THE NEWEST OCULIS UM AND WIT THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE GLASS IS THE RAYBANDS A THOSE ARE STILL THAT THOSE TWO EXPERIENCES ARE STILK KIND OF BLOWING MY MIND ESPECIALLY THE THE UM THE THE RAYBAN GLASSES AND I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS SO ILL RESIST BUT UM I WEMETIN TO THAT O KET WELL YE I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THE AR MY LAV AS USED WE ARE UM JERMY BAYLINSONS LAB IT AT IM STAMPER IS ONE OF THE PIONEERING LABS OF VIARE IN AND MIXED REALITY I GUESS SOME LEAST CALLHT AUGMENTED REALITY BUT NOW MIXED REALITY I THINK WHAT' SO STRIKING ABOUT THEE ARE THAT I'M GES I HAVE ME TRY TO DAY IS HOW WELL IT INTERFACES WITH THE WITH THE REAL ROOM LET'S CALL IT THEN THE PHYSICAL ROOM CAUSE I I COULD STILL SEE PEOPLE I COULD SEE WHERE THE FURNITURE WAS ORIHT IT WASN'T IN A BUMP IN ANYTHING I COULD SEE PEOPLE'S SMILES I COULD SEE MY MY U MY WATER ON THE TABLE WHILE I WAS DOING THIS WHAT FELT LIKE A REAL MARSHAL AR'S EXPERIENCE EXCEPT I WASN'T GETTING HIT A IWI WAS GETT ING IT VIRTUALLY BUT IT'S EXTREMELY ENGAGING AND YET IT ON THE GOOD SIDE THINGS IT REALLY BY PASSIS A LOT OF THE EARLY CONCERNS THE BAYLANS AND LAB AGAIN A JERMY SLAB WAT'S EARLY TO SAY THAT OH YOU KNOW THERE'S A LIMITS HOW MUCH O E ARE ONE CAN OR SHOULD USE EACH DAY UM EVEN FOR THE ADULT BRAIN BECAUSE IT CAN REALLY DISTROPT YOUARE A VESTIBULAR SYSTEM YOUR SENSE OF BALANCE ALL OF THAT SEEMS TO'VE BEEN DEALT WITH IN THIS NEW THIS NEW ITERATION OF THE ARE LIKE WE DIDN'T COME OUT OF IT FEELING DIZZY IT ALL I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS RE ENTERING THE ROOM IN A WAY THAT WAS REALLY JARRING ERE GOING INTO IT IS OBVIOUSLY WELL THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD BUT YOU CAN LOOK LOOK HERE LAFT AND SAY OH WHY SOMEONE JUST CAME IN THE DOOR HAY HOWS IT GO AND HOLD ON AND PLAYING THIS GAME JUST AS IT WAS WHEN I WAS A KID PLAYING AN INTEND NOU AND SOME ONE WALK IN IT'S FULLY ENGROSSING BUT YOU ME HOLD ON AND YOU SEE THERE THERE SO FIRST OF ALL AM BRAVO IM INCREDIBLE IUM AND THEN THE NEXT QUESTION IS YOU DON'T WHAT IS THIS WHAT  WE EVEN CALL THIS EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT IS TRULY MIXED IT'S ATTREALLY MIXED REALITY EXPERIENCE YEIMI MIXED REALITIES IS SORT OF THE UMBRELLA TERM THAT REFERS TO THE COMBINED EXPERIENCE OF VIRTUAL AN AUGMENTED REALITY SO AUGMENTED REALITY IS IN WHAT YOU'RE EVENTUALLY GING TO GET WITH IN SOME FUTURE VERSION OF THE SMART GLASSES WHERE YOU'RE PRIMARILY SEEING THE WORLD RIGHT BUT IM BUT YOU CAN PUT HOLEGRAMS IN IT RIGHT SO LIKE THAT WELL HAVE A IN A FUTURE WHERE YOU CAN WALK INTO A ROOM AND  ABIK AS MANY HOLEGRAMS AS AS PHYSICAL OBJECTS COR IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT LIKE ALL THE PAPER THE TF ART PHYSICAL GAMES MEDIA YOUR WORK STATION ND YOU' REFERRING IF TIT LET'S AY AN M  I I I WE CULD DRAD UP ON THE TABLE REGHT HERE AND JUST OUT IT REPEAT AS THE STAS TURNING AND LOOKING INTO SCREE HAVEN'T PR MUCH ANY SCREEN THAT EXISTS COULD BE A HOLEGRAM IN THE FUTURE WITH SMART GLASSES RIGHT THERE'S NOTHING THAT ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY NEEDS TO BE THERE FOR THAT WHEN YOU HAVE GLASSES THAT CAN PUT IM A HOLEGRAM THERE AND AND IT'S AN INTERESTING THOGHT EXPERIMENT JO GO AROUND AND THINK ABOUT A WHAT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE PHYSICAL IN THE WORLD NEED TO ACTUALLY BE PHYSICAL YOUR CHAIR DOES RETCAUSE YOU'RE SITTING ON IT A HOLEGRAM ISN'TGON TO SUPPORT YOU BUT I LIKE THAT ART ON THE WALL ANDAND THAT DOESN'T NEEDS TO PHYSICALLY BE THERE AAND IM SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT SORT OF THE AUGMENTED REALITY EXPERIENCE THEY WERE MOVING TOWARDS AND THEN WE'VE HAD THESE HEAD SETS THAT HISTORICALLY WE THINK ABOUT AS WE ARE AND THAT HAS BEEN SOMEHING THAT KIND OF IT'S LIKE A FULLY UMERSE OF EXPERIENCE BUT NOW WE'RE KIND OF GETTING SOMEING IT'S A HIGHBRID IN BETWEEN THE TWO AND CAPABLE OF BOTH WHICH IS A HEAD SET THAT CAN DO BOTH VIRTUAL REALITY AND SOME OF THESE AUGMENTED REALITY EXPERIENCES AND ND THAT THAT'S REALLY POWERFUL I'M BOTH BECAUSE YOU'R CAN GET NEW APPLICATIONS THAT THAT CANT OF ALLOW PEOPLE TO COLLABORATE TOGETHER AND I NT MAYBE THE TWO OF US ORE HERE PHYSICALLY BUT IVE SOME ONE JOINS US AND IT'S THEIR AVITAR THERE OR MAYBE IN IT'S SOME VIRSION IN THE FUTURE LIKE WE'RE HAVING A YOUR HAVING A TEA MEETING AND YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE THEYRE PHYSICALLY ANDYOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE DILING IND AND THEY'RE BASICLEK A HOLEGRAM THEY'RE VIRTUALLY BUT THN YOU ILT HAVE SOME A EYE IS THAT A PERSONAS THAT ARE ON YOUR TEAM THAT ARE HELPING YOU DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEY CAN BE EMBODYED AS AVITARS AND AROUND THE TABLE MEETING WITH YOU PES OO GOING TO BE DOING FIRST DATES THAT ARE A PHYSICALLY SEPARATED I COULD IMAGINE THAT SOME PEOPLEWOULD IS IT EVEN WORTH LEAVING THE HOUSE TYGPT DAY AND THEN THEY FIND OUT ANDTHEN THEY MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME AI MEAN MAYBE I THINK U NOW I DATING HAS PHYSICAL ASPECTS TO IT TOO SO I AND I DON'T BE  I NOT BE THEY WANT TO KO WHETHER NOT IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT TO HEAD OUT TO WHAT WHEN NOTS N IT I ONE OF IG I LI DIVIDE RIGHT IT IS POSSIBLE I MAD I KNOW LIKE ASOME OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE DATING BASICALLY YOU SAY THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE LIKE A SAFE EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY'RE IF THEY'RE GOING ON A FIRST DATE THEY'LL SCHEDULE SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE SHORTER AND MAYBE THEMIDDLE THE DAY LIKE TO MAVE IT'S COFFEES THAT WAY IF THEY DON'T LIKE THE PERSON THEY CAN JUST CONE TO GET OUT BEFORE LIKE  GOING IN SCHEDULING A DINNER OR LIKE A REAL FULL DATE O I'DO NOW MAYBE IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE WILL WE'LL KIND OF HAVE THAT EXPERIEN T'S A WHERE YOU CAN FEEL LIKE YOUR COUNT OF SITTING THERE AND IT'S AND IT'S EVEN EASIER AND LIGHTER WAIGHT AND SAFER AND IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING A GOOD EXPERIENCE YOU CAN JUST LIKE TELL APORD OUT OF THERE AND BEYON I'M BUT YET I THINK THA THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING QUESTION IN THE FUTURE IS I'M THERE ARE CLEARLY A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE ONLY POSSIBLE PHYSICALLY THAT OR SO MUCH BETTER PHYSICALLY AND THEN THERE ARE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE BUILDING UP THAT IT CAN BE DIGITAL EXPERIENCES BUT IT'S THIS WEIRD ART A FACT OF IOF HOW THE STUFF HAS BEN DEVELOPED THAT THE DIGITAL WORLD IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD EXIST IN THESE LIKE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLANS ORE YOU ONT INTERACT WITH HE DIGINAL WORLD WHEN WE DO ITALL THE TIME BUT WE PULL OUT A SMALL SCREEN OR WE HAVE A BIG SCREEN IT'S BASICLLY WEREN'N TERACTING THE DIGINL WORLD THROUGH THESE SCREENS BUT I THINK WE FAST FORWARD IN A DECADE OR MORE IT'S I THINK ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT LIKE WHAT IS THE WORLD THAT WERE ON TO LIVE IN I THINK IT'S CAN INCREASINGLY BE THIS MESH OF THE PHYSICAL AND DIGINAL WORLDS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO FEEL E THAT THE THE WORLD THAT WE'RE IN IS JUST A LOT RICHER ECAUSE THERE CAN BE ALL THESE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CREATE THAT ARE SO MUCH EASIER TO DU DIGIALY THAN THAN PHYSICALLY I'M BUT IT BE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A REAL COUNT OF PHYSICAL SENSE OF PRESENCE WITH THESE THINGS AND NOT FEEL LIKE INTERACTING IN THE DIGINAL WORLD IS TAKING YOU AWAY FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD WHICH SAY IS JUST SO MUCH VISORELY RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL I I THNK THE THE DIGNAL WORLD WILL SORT OF BE BEDDED IN THE IN THAT AND IM AND AND WE'LL FEEL KIND OF JUST AS VIVID IN A LOT OF WAYS SO THAT'S WHY I WAYS THINK ANDWHEN OU'RE SAYING BEFORE AND YOU FELT LIKE YOU COULD LOOK ROUND AND SEE THE REAL ROOM ICTUALLIN OF THERE'S AN INTERESTING CUNT OF PHILOSOPHICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE REAL ROOM AND THE PHYSICAL ROOM I'M WHICH YOU HISTORICALLY I THINK PEOPLEWOUD HAVE SAID THOSE OF THE SAME THING BUT I ACTUAL THING IN THE FUTURE THE REAL ROOM IS GOING TO BE THE COMBINATION OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD WITH ALL THE DIGITAL ART OFFACTS AND OBJECTS THAT ARE IN THERE THAT YOU CAN INTERACT WITH THEM AND FEEL PRESENT WHER'S THE PHYSICAL WORLD IS JUST THE PART THAT'S PHYSICALLY THERE AND I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO BUILD A REAL WORLD THAT'S THE SUM OF THESE TWO THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE IN A MORE PROFOUND EXPERIENCE THAN WHAT WE HAVE TO DAY I WAS STRUCK BY THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE VIARE AND THE PHYSICAL ROOM A YOUR TEAM HAD ME TRY A UM I GUESS AS AN EXERCISE CLASS IN THE FORMING BUT WAS LIKE SENTIALY LIKE HATTING MITS BOXING SO HEA TARGET'S BOXING NATURAL YD AND AND COMES AT A FAIRLY FAST PACE AT THAN PICKS UP IT'S GOT SOME TUTORIALS VERY EASY TO USE AND CERTAINLY GOT MY HEART RIGHT UP I'M IN AT LEAST DECENT SHAPE UM AND I'VE TO BE HONEST I NEVER ONCE DESIRED TO DO ANY OF THESE ONSCREEN FITNESS THINGS I'M N I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE AVERSIVE THAN IT LIKE LIKE A CLATLET LIKE I DO'T WAT INSULT ANY PARTICULAR PRODUCTS UM BUT LIKE WRIDING A STATIONARY BIKE WHILE LOOKING AT A SCREEN OF PRETENDING O'M ON A ROAD OUTSIDE I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING WORSE FOR ME UM MAYBE LI YOU LIKE THE LEADER BOAR IT  GA YO EST A VERY COMPETITIVE P A YOUR GIN TO BE RUNNING ON A TREADMILL YEAT LEAST GIVE ME A LEADER BOARD THATI HAVE BEAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAD OF ME I LIKE MOVING OUTSIDE AND AND CERTAINLY AN EXERCISE CLASS OR A ROBIX'S CLASS AS THEY USED TO CALL THEM BUT WHAT THE EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO DAY WAS EXTREMELY ENGAGING UM AND I'VE DONE ENOUGH BOXING TO HE LEAST KNOW HOW TO TO DO A LITL BIT OF IT AND REALLY ENJOYED IT GETS YOUR HART RIGHT UP AND I COMPLETELY FORGOT THAT I WAS DOING I IN ONSCREEN EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IMPART BECAUSE I BELIEVE I WAS STILL IN THAT PHYSICAL ROOM UM AND I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE MASH OF THE PHYSICAL ROOM AND THE VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE THAT UM MAKES IT NEITHER OF ONE WORLD OR THE OTHER I'VE NI REALLY FELT AT THE INTERFACE OF THOSE AND AND CERTAINLY GOT PRESENCE THIS FEELING FORGETTING THAT I WAS IN A VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE AND UM GOT MY HURRIED UP PRETTY QUICKLY WE HAD TO STOP AS WE WERE IN A START RECORDING BUT I WOULD DO THAT FOR A GOOD FORTY FIVE MINUTES IN THE MORNING AND AH AND AND Y THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU COULD PAY ME TRULY TO I LOOK AT A SCREEN WHILE PEDDLING ON A BIKER RUNNING ON A TREADMILL SO UM AGAIN NBRAVO I THINK IT'S CAN BE VERY USEFUL IT TO GOING TO GET PEOPLE ANG THEIR BODIES MORE WHICH CERTAINLY SOCIAL MEDYA UP UNTIL NOW AND A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT THAT BOTH CHILDREN AND DULTERE ENGAGED IN SO AND WE KNOW WE NEED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EUROPE PROPONENT OF IN PRACTICAND OR OTHERS CLACK TO BE SI IS THIS A MAJOR GOAL OF MEDA GET PEOPLE MOVING THEIR BODIES MORE AND GETTING THEIR HART RATES UP AND AND SO ON I THINK WE WANT TO ENABLE IT I THNK IT'S GOOD BUT I I THINK IT COMES MORE FROM LIKE A PHILOSOPHICAL VIEW OF THE WORLD THEN IT IS NES SIR LAMON I DON'T GO INTO BUILDING PRODUCTS TO TRY O SHAPE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR RUT I I BELIEVE IN EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT AND BE THE BEST VERSION OF THEMSELVES THAT THEY CAN BE TO KNOW AGEND THAT'S SAID I DO BELIEVE THAT AN THERE'S THE THE PREVIOUS GENERATION OF COMPUTERS WERE DEVICES FOR YOUR MIND AND I THINK THAT WE ARE NOT BRAINS AND TANKS I'M YOU KNOW IT'S ELECT THING THAT THEIRS SORT OF A A PHILOSOPHICAL VIEW OF PEOPLE LIKE LOOK AT YOU YOU ARE PRIMARILY IN WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT OR YOUR VALUES OR SOMETING ITSICNO YOU ARE THAT AND YOU ARE A PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION AND PEOPLE WERE VERY PHYSICAL AND I THINK BUILDING A COMPUTER FOR YOUR WHOLE BODY AND NOT JUST FOR YOUR MIND IS VERY FITTING WITH THIS WORLD VIEW THAT LIKE THE ACTUAL ESSENCE OF YOU IF YOU WANT TO BE PRESENT WITH ANOTHER PERSON IF YOU WANT TO LIKE BE FULLY ENGAGED IN EXPERIENCE IS NOT JUST OKA IT'S NOT JUST A VIDIA CONFERENCE CALL THAT LOOKS AT YOUR FACE AND WHERE YOU CAN LIKE SHARE IDEAS I'M IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE YOUR WHOLE BODY SO YE MON I THINK BEING PHYSICALS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME EMINETS IM THAT'S IT JUST IT THE THAT'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW THE MOST F UNSTUFF THAT I GET TO DO M IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF HOW I PERSONALLY BALANCE MY ENERGY LEVELS AND JUST GET A DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCES BECAUSE ANI COULD SPEND ALL MY TIME RUNNING THE COMPANY I'M BUT I THING IT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO DO SOME DIFFERENT THINGS AND  COMPETE DIFFERENT AREAS OR LEARN DIFFERENT THINGS AND ALL OF THAT I'M IS GOOD IF IF PEOPLE WANT A YOU DON'T DO REALLY INTENSE WORK OUTS WITH I'M WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH QUEST OR WITH I'M YOU'M EVENTUALLY OUR GLASSES GREAT BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO LIKE A REALLY INTENSE WORK OUT I THINK JUST HAVING A COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT AND PLATFORM WHICH ISN ITHERENTLY PHYSICAL CAPTURES MORE OF THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE ARE AS PEOPLE THAN ANY OF THE PREVIOUS COMPUTING PLATFORMS THAT WE'VE HAD TO DATE I WAS EVEN THING JUST OF THE 'M SIMPLE TASK OF GETTING A BETTER RANGE OF MOTION ACATE FLEXIBILITY I COAL IMAGINE INSIDE OF THE VAR EXPERIENCE YOU'R LEANING INTO A STRATCHING A STANDARD KIND OF LIKE LIKE YOU LUNCH TRIPE STRATCHED BUT ACTUALLY SEEIN A METER OF LIKE ARE YOU GET ARE YOU APPROACHING NEW LEVELS OF FLEXIBILITY IN THAT MOMENT I WES ACTUING MEASURING SOME SOME KINESTHETIC AELEMENTS ON THE BODY IN THE JOINTS AND I'M NOITS IS TRUNT WHEREAS NORMALLY OUMIGHT AVETER YOU THAT IN FRONT OF A CAMERA WHICH THEN WOULD GIVE YOU THE DATE ON A SCREEN THAT YOU LOOK AT AFTERWARDS OR HIGHER AN EXPENSIVE COACH BUT SO OR LOOKING AT A FORM IN RESISTANCE TRAINING SYORE AACTUALLY LIFTING PHYSICAL WEIGHTS BUT IT'S TELLING YOU WHETHER NOT YOU'R BREAKING FORM I MEAN THAT THERE'S SO MUCH AT COULD BE DONE INSIDE O THERE AND THEN MY MIND JUSTARCS ASPIRAL INTO LIKE WHILD THIS IS VERY LIKELY TO TRANSFORM WHAT WE THINK OF AS QUILDING  EXERCISE YE I THINK SO I THIN THERE STILL A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO GET ANSWERED I'M YOU DON'T I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLEAR GIN A NECSSARILY WANT TO INSTALL IN A LOT OF CENSORS OR CAMERAS TO TRACK THEIR WHOLE BODIES WHO WERE JUST OVERTIME GETING BETTER FROM THE CENSORS THAT ARE ON THE HEADSETS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO VERY GOOD HAND TRACKING RIGHTS AVEN WE WE HAVE THIS RESEARCH DOM OWERE OU NOW JUST WITH THE HAND TRACKING IM FROM THE HEADS THAT YOU CAN TYPE IT JUST PROJECTS A LITTLE KEYBOARD ONTO YOUR TABLE AND YOU CAN TYPE AN PEOPLE LIKE TYPELIC A HUNDRED WORDS A MINUTE WITH THAT WITH A RASIAL KEYBWARD YAH WE'RE STARTING TO BE ABLE TOU IM USING SOME MODERN A I TECHNIQUES BE ABLE TO LIKE SMULATEAN UNDERSTAND WHERE YOUR TORSOS POSIION IS IM EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SEE IT YOU CAN SEE AT A BUNCH OF THE TIME AND IF YOU FUSE TOGETHER WHAT YOU DO SEE IM WITH LIKE THE ECCELEROMETER AND UNDERSTNDING HOW THE THING IS MOVING OU CAN KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BODY POSITION IS GIN TO BE IM BUT SOMETHINGS YOUR STILL CAN BE HARD RIGHTS O  YOU MENTION BOXING IM THAT ONE WORKS PRETTY WELL BECAUSE IN A WUNDERSTAND YOUR HEAD POSITION WE UNDERSTAND YOUR HANDS M AND AND NOW WE'RE WERE KIND OF INCREASINGLY UNDERSTANDING YOUR YOUR BODY POSITION IM BULIT SO YOU WANT TO EXPAND THAT TO IM MOITIE OR KICK BOXING E SO LEGS THAT'S A DIFFERENT PART ATTRACKING THAT'S HARDER IM CAUSE THAT'S OUT OF THE FIELD OF YOU MORE THE TIME BUT THERE'S ALSO THE ELEMENT OF RESISTANCE RIGHTS SO YOU CAN THROW A PUNCH AND RETRACT IT AND SHADOW BOXIN IN O DO THAT IM WITHOUT UPSETTING YOUR CONT OF PHYSICAL BALANCE THAT MUCH BUT IF YOU WON TO THROW A ROUND HOUSE KICK IM AND THERE'S NO ONE THERE THEN IAN YOU KNOW'M THE STANDARD WHERE THEY DO IN WHEN YOUR SHADOW BOXING AS YOU BASELY DO A LITTLE THREGE SIXTY BUT LIKE I KNOWS THAT AS THAT CAN FEEL GREAT I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT THAT EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE IM AND THE IF YOU WANT TO GO EVEN FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO GET LIKE GRAPPLING IM TIT TO WORK IM I I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING RESISTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE FORCES APPLIED TO YOU WOULD BE AND JUS THEN YOU GET INTO OCAME MAYBE ER CAN HAVE SOME KIND OF BODY SUIT THAT CAN APPLY YOUR HAPTICKS BUT I'M NOT IN SURE THAT THAT EVEN A PRETTY ADVANCED TAPTIC SYSTEN IS GOING O BE IL TO BE QUITE GOOD ENOUGH TO DO JO SIMULATE LIKE THE ACTUAL FORCES THAT WOULD BE APPLIED TO YOU IM IN A GRAPPLING SONARIO SO THIS IS PART OF WHAT'S FUN ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THOSE YOU GET YOU KEEP ON GETTING NEW CAPABILITIES AND THEN YOU NEED TO FIGURE WHAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THEM SO I THINK IT'S REALLY NEAT THAT WE CAN CAN A DO BOXING AND WE CAN DO THE SUPERNATURAL THING AND 'M THERS A BUNCH OF ALL SOME CARDIO AND DANCING AND THINGS LIKE THAT AM AND THEN THERE'S ALSO STILL SO MUCH MORE TO DO THAT THAT I'M EXCITED TO TO CA A GET TO OVER TIME BUT IM BUT IT'S AD IT'S A LONG JOURNEY ND WHAT ABOUT THINGS LIKE UM PAINTING AND ART AN MUSEA YOU IMAGINE UM YOU DON'T OF COURSE YOU BEEL LIKE DIFFERENT MEDIUMS THA CO LIKE TO DRAW AN PEN AND PENCIL BUT I COULD IMAGINE TREN TO LEARN HOW TO PAINT IN VIRTUALLY AND OF COURSE YOU COULD PRINT OUT OF PHYSICAL THE ORIGIN OF THAT AT THE END THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO DEPART FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD HIT COULD END IN THE PHYSICAL WORDID YOU SEE THE DEMO THE THE PIANO DANO WHERE YOU AM EITHER YOU'RE THERE WITH A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD FOR COULD BE A VIRTUAL KEYBOARD BUT THE APBASICALLY HIGHLIGHT'S WHAT KEYS YOU NEED TO PRESS AM IN ORDER TO PLAY THE SONG SO IT'S BASICALLY LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR PIANO AND IT'S TEACHING YOU HOW TO PLAY A SONG THAT YOU CHOOSE AN ACTUAL PIANO YEBUT IT'S ILLUMINATING CERTAIN KEYS IN IN THE VIRTUALS YES AND IT CAN EITHER BE A VIRTUAL PIANO IF YOU OR KEYBOARD IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PIANO OR KEYBOARD OR IT COULD USE YOUR ACTUAL KEYBOARD A SO YA AM I THINK STUFF LIKE THAT IS GOING TO BE REALLY FASCINATING FOR EDUCATION AN EXPRESSION AM AND FOR BROAD EXCUSE ME BUT FOR AND FOR BROADENING ACCESS TO TOTAL EXPENSE OF EQUIMENT I MA PIANO IS IS NO SMALL EXPENSE E CLIM IT'S AND IT TAKES UP A LOT OF SPACE AND ABBYTUNED YEAM THE THING OF ALL TESE THINGS THE KID THAT HAS VERY LTTLE IN CAMMER THE FAMILY AS REALILE INCOME COULD LEARN TO PLAY A VIRTUAL PIANO AT MUCH LOWER TOS THE EN IT GET'S BACK TO THE QUESTION I WAS ASKING BEFORE ABOUT THIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT OF HOW MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE PHYSICALLY HAVE TO DAY ACTUALLY NEED TO BE PHYSICAL THE PIANO DOESN'T A MAYBE THERE'S SOME PREMIUM WHERE IT'S MAYBE IT'S A SOMEWHAT BETTER MORE TACTAL TACTAL EXPERIENCE TO HAVE A PHYSICAL ONE BUT FOR PEOPL WHO DON'T HAVE THE SPACE FOR IT OR WHO WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO TO BUY A PIANO OR JIST AREN'T SURE THAT THEY WOULD ONT TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT OT THE BEGINNING OF LEARNING OUT OF PLAY PIANO I THINK IN THE FUTURE YOU'LL HAVE THE OPTION OF JUSTBUYING IN AN AP OR A HOLEGRAM PIANO WHICH WILL BE IN A LOT MORE AFFORDABLE IM AND  I THINK IT'S CAN BE THAT'S CAN TO BE UNLOCK UNLOCK ATON A CREATIVITY TOO BECAUSE AND INSTEAD OF THE MARKET FOR PIANO MAKERS BEING CONSTRAINED TO LIKE A RELATIVELY SMALL SET OF EXPERTS WHO HAVE LIKE PERFECTED THAT CRAFT  YOURE CAN HAVE LIKE KIDS OR DEVELOPERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD DESIGNING CRAZY DESIGNS FOR AN POTENTIAL KEYBOARDS AND PIANOS THAT LOOK NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE'VE SEEN BEFORE BUT ARE MAYBE LIKE BRING EVEN MORE JOYAND OR EVEN MORE CAN AFIND IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE FEWER THESE PHYSICAL CONSTRAINT SO I I IFICATS CONSAID SCAMMIL ON A WILD STUFF TO EXPLORE THIS DEAFLING O BEHAD A WHILD STUFF TO I FLOR IT JUST HAD THIS I THIS IDEA SLESH A IMAGE IN MY MIND OF WHAT YOU ARE TOING UT MERGE WITH OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION WHEN PRICILLO IS HERE OF I COULD IMAGINE A TIME NOT TOO FLONG FROM NOWN WHERE YOU USING MIXED REALITY TO RUN EXPERIMENTS IN THE LAP LITERALLY MIXING VIRTUAL SOLUTIONS GETTING POTENTIAL OUTCOMES AND THEN PIANG THE BEST ONE TO THEN GO ACTUALLY DO IN THE REAILWORD WHICH IS VERY BOTH A FINANCIALLY COSTLY AND AND AM TIME WISE COSTLY YE MEAN PEOPLE ARE ALREADY USING TE ARE FOR SURGERY AN EDUCATION ON IT I'M THERE'S SOME STUDY THAT WAS DONE THAT IM BASIC WE DID IT  TRAGUA CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT OF PEOPLE WHO LEARNED HOW TO DO A SPECIFIC SURGERY I'M THROUGH JUST A NORMAL CONATEXTBOOK AND LECTURE METHOD VERSES LIKE YOU SHOW THE KNEE AND YOU HAVE IT IN'BE A LARGE BLOWN UP MODEL AND PEOPLE CAN MANIPULATID AND AND CAN A PRACTICE WHERE THEY WOULD MAKE IN THE COTS AND AND LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THAT CLASSTED BETTER SO AM I THINK THERE'S YIT'S I ITS CAN BE PROFOUND FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT ARAVS ANDLEST A EXAMPLE AT LEAPES TO MINYOU I THINK AT SOCIAL MEDIA AND ON LINE CULTURE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF CREATING A LOT OF A REAL WORLD LHAT'S CALL PHYSICAL WORLD'S SOCIAL ANXIETY FOR PEOPLE BUT I COULD IMAGINE I'M PRACTICING A SOCIAL INTERACTION WOR A KID THAT  HAS A LOT OF SOCIAL ANXIETY OR THAT NEEDS ADVOCATED FOR THEMSELVES BETTER LEARNING HOW TO DO THAT PROGRESSIVELY THROUGH A VIRTUAL INTERACTION AND THEN TAKING THAT TO THE REAL WORLD BECAUSE IT'S IT MY VERY RECENT EXPERIENCE TO DAY IT'S SO BLENDED NWOW WITH WITH REAL EXPERIENCE THAT THE KID THAT FEELS TERRIFIED OF ADVOCATING FOR THEMSELVES OR WE'RE JUST TALKINTO ANOTHER HUMAN BEINGER AND ADULL THERE BEING IN A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE OF A ROOMFUL OF KIDS YOU COULD REALLY EXPERIENCE THAT IN INSILICO FIRST GET COMFORTABLE LET THIS NERVOUS SYSTEM ATTENUATE A BIT AND THEN TAKE IT INTO THE COTIN QUOT PHYSICAL WORLD YET I THINK WE'LL SEE EXPERIENCES LIKE THAT AND I ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS SURROUND HOW PEOPLE INTERACT IN THIS KIND OF BLENDEDDIGITAL WORLD WE'LL BE MORE NEW ANTS IN OTHER WAYS I'M SURE THAT THEREILL BE KOND OF NEW ANXIETIES THAT PEOPLE DEVELOPED TO JUST LIKE NO TEENS TO DAY NEED TO NAVIGATE DYNAMICS SURROUND TEXTING CONSTANTLY THAT AM THAT WE JUST O HAVE WHEN WE WERE KIDS A SO I THINK IT WILL HOLPE THAT SOMETHINGS I THIN HT THERE WILL BE NEW ISSUES THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN HELP PEOPLE WORK THROUGH TOO BUT ABUT OVER ALL I THINK I ONW I THINK IT'S CAN BE REALLY POWERFUL AND POSITIVE THET'S TALK ABOUT THE GLASSES SIR THIS WAS WILD YE PUT ON A PAIR OF RABANS I LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOK THEY'RE CLEAR THEY LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER GLASS RABAN GLASSES AM EXCEPT THAT I COULD CALL OUT TO THE GLASSES I GO TO SAY YOU KNOW HEY META A I WANT TO LISTEN TO THE BOCH VARIATIONS THE GOLBER VARIATIONS OF BACH AND MET A RESPONDED AND NO ONE AROUND ME COULD HEAR BUT I COULD HEAR IM WITH EXQUISITE CLARITY MY WAY I'M NOT CAIN'T PAY TO SAY ANY THIS I'M JUST STILL BLOWN AWAY BY THIS OKS IM I WANT APPAIR OF THESE VERY BADLY I COULD HEAR OKE I'M SELECTING THOSE NOW AND WERE THAT THAT MUSIC NOW AND THEN I COULD HEAR IT IN THE BACKGROUND BUT THEN I COULD TILL HAVE A CONVERSATION SO THIS WAS NEITHER HEADPHONES IN NOR HEADPHONES OUT IM AND I COULD SAY WEIGHT PAUS THE MUSIC AND IT WOULD PAUS IM AND THE BEST PART WAS I DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM MENTALLY THE ANEMPT A MATS YECK OUT A PHONE YES IT WAS ALL INTERFACE THROUGH THIS VERY LOCAL ENVIRONMENT IN AND ROUND THE HEAD AND AS AE NURE SCIENTIST I'M FASCINING BY THIS BECAUSE OF COURSE ALL OF OUR PERCEPTIONS AUDITORY VISUAL AT CETERO CURRING IN INSIDE THE CASING OF THIS OF THE THING WE CALL A SKULL BUT IM MAYBE COULD COMMENT ON YOU TH THE ORIGIN OF THAT DESIGN FOR YOU E U KNOW WHAT THE IDEAS BEHIND THAT AND WHERE YOU THINK IT COULD GO BECAUSE I'M SURE I'M JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE THE REAL PRODUCT THAT WE WANT TO EVENTUALLY GET TO IS THIS CAN A FULL AUGMENTED REALITY PRODUCT IN A C STYLISH AND COMFORTABLE NORMAL GLASSES FORM FACTOR NOT DO ANY THE OR HEAD SET SO TO SPEAK NO I EN NA THAT HE OUR HEADS TAT DOES FEEL CONLI IT WILL BUT THINGS ON THE FAC THERES CAN BE PLACE FOR THAT TO JUST LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR LAP TOP AND YOUOV YOUR WORK STATION I'M OR MAYBE THE BETTER ANALOGY AS YOU'VE YOUR PHONE IN YOUOV YOUR WORK STATION I'M THESE A OUR GLASSES ARE GING TO BE LIKE YOUR PHONE AND THAT AND YOU HAVE SOMETHNG ON YOUR FACE AND YOU WILL I THINK BE ABLE TO IF YOU WANT WEAR IT FOR A LOT OF A DAY IN INTERACT WITH WITH IM WITH IT VERY FREQUENTLY I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLER CAN BE OURE WALKING AROUND THE WORLD WEARING YAR HEAD SETS WAT SO BUT YET THAT'S AT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE FUTURE THAT THAT IM THAT I'M CAN A HOPING WE GET TO BUT I DO THINK HA THERE AS A PLACE WHERE I'M FOR HAVING BECAUSE IT'S A BIGGEREFORM FACTOR IT HAS MORE COMPUTE POWER SO JUST LIKE YOUR WORK STATION OR YOUR YOUR KOIND OF BIGGER COMPUTER CAN DO MORE THAN YOUR PHONE CAN DO I' THERE'S A PLACE FOR THAT WHEN YOUWANT TO SETTLE INTO AN INTENSE TASK REAHT IF YOU HAVEN' DOCTOR WHO'S DOING A SURGERY I WOULD WANT THEM DOING IT THROUGH THE HEAD SET NOT THROUGH THAT CAND I'VE NOT THROUGH THEIR PHONE EQUIVALENT OR THAT THERE JUST KIND OF LOWER POWR ED GLASSES BUT JUST LIKE PHONES ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DO A LOT OF THINGS ING THE GLASSES WELL EVENTUALLY GET THERE TOO I'M NOW THAT'S THAID THERE'S A BUNCH OF REALLY HARD TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS I'M TO ADDRESS IN ORDER TO BEALD TO GET TO THIS POINT WHERE YOU CAN LIKE PUT CAN A FULL HOLEGRAMS IN THE WORLD YOU'RE BASICALLY MINIATURIZING A SUPERCOMPUTER AND PUTTING IT INTO A PAIR OF GLASSES I'M SO THAT THE PAIR OF GLASSES STILL LOOKS STYLISH AND NORMAL AND I'M THAT'S A REALLY HARD TECHKNOWLEDGE OU PROBLEM MAKING THINGS SMALL IS REALLY HARD 'M A HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY HIS M IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT OUR INDUSTRY IS OPTIMIZED FOR FOR IN A THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS NOW BUILDING SCREENS THERE'S A WHOLE CONOFINDUSTRIAL PROCESS AROUND THAT THAT GOES INTO PHONES ANTEVIES AND COMPUTERS AND LIKE INCREASINGLY SO MANY THINGS THAT THAT HAVE DIFFERENT SCREENS LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE PIPE LINE THAT'S GOTNE VERY GOOD OT MAKING THAT KIND OF SCREEN AND THE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAYS ARE JUST A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING RIGHT CAUSE IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A SCREEN RIGHT IT'S A THING THAT YOU CAN SHOOT LIGHT INTO THROUGH IN A LAZER OR SOME OTHER KIND OF PROJECTOR AND IT CAN PLACE THAT AS AN OBJECT IN THE WORLD SO THAT'S GOIN TO NY TO BE THIS WHOLE OTHER AN INDUSTRIAL PROCESS THAT GETS BUILT UP TO DOING THAT LIKE IN AN EFFICIENT WAY SO ALL THAT'S THAT WWE'RE BASICALY TAKING TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TOWARDS BUILDING THIS AT ONCE ONE IS WE OR TRY TO KEEP IN MIND WHAT IS THE THE LONG TURM THING THAT IT'S NOT SUPERFAR OFF I THINK WITHIN YOU KNOW FEW YEARS I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING THAT THATS SORT OF A FIRST VERSION OF COND OF THIS FULL VISION THE'M TALKING ABOUT AND WE HAVE SOMEHING THAT'S WORKING INTERNALLY THAT WE USES LIKE AT THAT WE USE A DEVICATE I'M BUT THAT ONE THAT'S THAT'S CONE OF BIG CHALLENGE IT'S CAN BE WOREXPENSIVE AM AND IT'S HARDER TO GET AL THE PIECES WORKING THE OTHER REPROACH HAS BEEN ARE IGHT LET'S START WITH WHAT WE KNOW WE CAN PUT INTO A A PAIR OF STYLISH SON GLASSES TO DAY AND JUST MAKE THEM AS SMART AS WE CAN SO YOU NOW FOR THE FIRST VERSION AND WE WE WORKED WITH A WE DI THIS CLOBRATION WITH RAYBAN RIKE AS THAT'S LIKE WELL ACCEPTED YOU KNOW THESE ARE WELL DESIGNED GLASSES THEIR CLASSIC PEOPLE OF HAVE USED THEM FOR DECADES FOR THE FIRST VERSION WE GOT CENSER ON THE FRONT SO YOU COULD CAPTURE MOMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE YOUR PHONE OUT OF YOUR POCKETS YOU GOT PHOTOS AND VIDIOS A YOU HAVE THE SPEAKER AND THE MICROPHONES YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC AM YOU COULD COMMUNICATE WITH IT AH BUT IT WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS SORT OF  THE FIRST VERSIONOF IT WE HAD A LOT OF BASICS THERE BUT WE SAW PEOPLE USED IT AND WE TUNED IT WE MADE THE THE CAMERA IS LIKE TWICE AS GOOD FOR FOR THIS NEW VERSION THAT WE MADE THE AUDU HAS A LOT CRISPER FOR THE USE CASES THA WE SAW THE PEOPLE ACK SHE USED WHICH IS SOME OF US LISTENING TO MUSIC BUT A LOT OF IT IS LIKE PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE CALLS ON THEIR GLASSES A AN WE LISTEN TO PODCASTS RIT YOU A THE BIGGEST THING THAT I THINK ITS INTERESTING IS THE ABILITY GET A EYE RUNNING ON IT WHICH IT IT DOESN'T JUST RUN ON THE ON THE GLASSES IT ALSO IT CAN PROXYES THROUGH YOUR PHONE BUT AN WITH ALL THE ADVANCES IN ELLA LAMS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ABIT IN THE THE FIRST PART OF OF THE THE CONVERSATION A HAVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE YOUR MEDA A IY ASSISTANT THATYOU CAN JUST TALK TOAN BASICALLY ASK ANY QUESTION THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS I THINK IT WE REALLY FASCINATING AND YOU NO LIKE YOUARE SAYING ABOUT CAN OF HOW WE HOW WE PROCESS THE WORLD AS PEOPLE A VENTUALLY I THINK YOU'RE GOIG TO WANT YOUR A EY ASSISTANT TO BELL TO SEE WHAT YOU SEE AND HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR WE'M NOT ALL THE TIME WE YU'RE GOIN TO WONT TO BEAL TO TELL IT TO GO INTO A MODE WHERE IT CAN SEE WHAT US Y AND HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR AND WHAT'S THE KIND OF DEVICE DESIGN THAT BEST KIND OF POSITIONS AY I ASSISTANT TO BEAL TO SEE WHAT YOU SEE AND HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR SO CANBEST HELP YOU LL IT'S GLASSES RIGHT WHERE WERE BASKLY HAS A SENSERTEBEAL TO SEE WHAT YOU SEE AND IM A MICROPHONE THAT IS CLOSE TO YOUR YEARS THAT CAN HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR IM THE OTHER DESINGLES IS LIKE YOU SAID TO KEEP YOU PRESEN IN THE WORLD RIGHTS I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH PHONES IS THEY CANT O PULL YOU AWAY FROM FROM WHAT'S PHYSICALLY HAPPENING AROUND YOU AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF COMPUTING WILL DO THAT AM I JUST CHUCKLING MYSELF BECAUSE IAVE A FRIEND HE'S A VERY WELL KNOWN PHATOGRAPHER AND HE WAS LAUGHING ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE GO TO A CONCERT AND EVERYONE'S FILMING THE CONCERT ON ON OUR PHONE E THEY CAN BE THE PERSON THAT POST THE THING BUT LATE THEIR LURLY MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE WROPOST OS EXACT SAME THING BUT SOMEHOW OUR UNIQUE EX IT FEELS IMPORTANT TO POST OUR UNIQUE EXPERIENCE WITH GLASSES THAT WOULD  ESSENTIALLY OF SMOOTH THAT AM GAP I'M COMPLETELY YET O LAM E CUS WORRY ABOUT IT LATER DOWNLOADE  THERE ARE ISSUES I REALIZE WITH WITH GLASSES BECAUSE THEY ARE SO SEEMLESS WITH EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE EVEN THOUGHYOU MAN I AREN'T WEARING THEM NOW IT'S VERY COMMON FOR PEOPLE THO WERE GLASSES IM A ISSUES OF RECORDING IN CONSENT YET LIKE LI LIKE GOING IE GOING INTO A LOCKER ROOM AT MY GIM IT'S O I LI MI SUMING TAT THE PEOPLE WITH GLASSES AREN'T FILMING WHERE AS ONE'S RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE'S A A SHARP TRANSITION WHEN WHEN THERE'S A PHONE IN AN A ROOM AND SOME ONE'S POINTING IT AM PEOPLE GENERALLY SAY KNOW IT NOPHONES IN GELOCKROOMS AND RECORDING AM SO THAT'S JUST ONE INSTANT SOMEMING THEIR OTHER AND WE HAVE THE WHOLE PRIVACY LIGHT I DI CAN GETYUAS SUE FOR THET YES SO IT'S ANY TIME THAT IT'S ACTIVE THAT THE CAMERACENSER IS ACTIVE IM IT'S IT'S BASICALLY LIKE PULSING A WHITE BRIGHT LIGHT GODDESS SO WHICH IS BY WAY MORE THAN CAMERAS DO  RI IM WAS I  GOITING A TE I MANS AN I RHONES ARENT AREN'T COUNT OF SHOWING A WHITE A BRIGHT CENSOR WHEN WHEN YOUR TECHNAPHOTO SO NO PEOPLE OFTENTIMES WILL PRETEND THEIR TEXTING IN THEIR ACTUAL REORDING AS SHE SAW AN INSTANCE OF THIS IN A BARBER SHOP ONCE WHERE SOME ONE WAS RECORDING AND THEY WERE PRETENDING THAT THEY WERE TEXTING AND T IN INT INTEREST HETE WAS A PRETTY INTENSE INTERACTION THAT ENSUED AND IT WAS LIKE WO YOU KNOW ITS FOR PRETTY EASY FOR PEOPLE THO DEFAIN TEXTING WHILE ACTUALLY RECORDING YES SO I THINK WHEN YOU ARE VALUATING A RISK WITH A NEW TECHNOLOGY THE BAR SHOULDN'T BE IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING BAD IT'S DOES THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY MAKE IT EASIER TO DO SOMETHING BAD THAN WHAT PEOPLE ALREADY HAD AND I THNK BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS PRIVACY LIGHT THAT IS JUST BROADCASTING TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU AY THIS THING IS RECORDING NOW A I'VE NOT THAT MAKES IT ACTUALLY LESS DISCREET TO DO IT THROUGH THE GLASSES THAN WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH A PHONE ALREADY A WHICH I THINK AS IS BASEFHROUGH THE BAR THAT WE WANTED TO GET OVER FROM A DESIGNE PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU FOR POINT OUT THAT IT HAS THE PRIVACY LIGHT I DIDN'T GET LONG ENOUGH IN THE EXPERIENCE TO EXPLORE ALL THE FEATURES BUT AM AGAIN I CAN THINK OF A LOT OF USE AS AM BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT A RESTAURANT FROM THE OUTSIDE AND SEE THE MEN YOU OH YAM GET STATIS AND HOW CROWDED IT IS A IAS MUCH AS I LOVE I DON'TWAT TO CALL OUT LET YOU SAY A APBASED MAP A FUNCTIONS THAT ALLOW YOU TO NAVIGATE AND THE AUDIO IS O K IT'S NICE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AM WITH SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE OR IN THE VEHICLE AND JUST  BE GREAT IF THE ROAD WAS TRACED WHERE I SHOULD TURN THE ABSOLUT THESE KINDS OF THINGS EE LIKE IT THAT'S CAN BE STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR FOR MEDAANINSTANT CRE A UTURE VERSION WE'LL HAE ITS BUTD ALSO HAVE THE HOLEGRAPHIC DISPLAY WORK CAN SHOW YOU THE DIRECTIONS BUT II'VE NOT THERE OLD BASICALLY JUST BE INDIFFERENT PRICE POINTS THAT PACK DIFFERENT SAMOUNTS OF TECHNOLOGY THE HOLEGRAPHIC DISPLAY PART I THINK I'S GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN DOING ONE THAT JUST HAS THE A I BUT IS A BUT IT'S PRIMARILY COMMUNICATING YOU WIT WITH YOU THROUGADIO SIMMEAN THAT THE CURRENT RAYBAND MAT A GLASSES IR TWO NINETY NINE IM YOU NIT THINK WHEN WE HAVE ONE THAT HAS A DISPLAY IN IT IT'LL PRIVOU SOME AMOUNT MORE THAN THAT BUT IT'LL ALSO BE MORE POWERFUL SO I THINK THAT THEIT'LL PEOPLE CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT O USE BASED ON WHAT THE CAPABILITIES ARE AT THEY WANT AND WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD BUT IM BUT A LOT OF OUR GOAL AND BUILDING THINGS IS IM YOU KNO WE TRY TO MAKE THINGS THAT CAN BE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE IM  OUR GAME AS A COMPANY ISN'T TO BUILD THINGS AND THEN CHARGE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR IT WE TRY TO BUILD THINGS THAT THEN EVERY ONE CAN USE M AND THEN BECOME MORE USEFUL BECAUSE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE USING THEM I SO IT'S JUST A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH IM YOU KNOW WERE NOT WERE NOT LIKE APPLE OR AR SOME OF THESE COMPANIES THAT JUST TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING N THEN SELL IT FOR AS MUCH IM AS AS AS THEY CAN WHICH I MEAN THEIR GREAT COMPANY SOMMING A FOR THA BHAT THAT MODELL CON OVIS IS FINE TOO BUT IM BUT ARE OUR APPROACHES CAN BE WE WANT STUFF THAT CAN BE A FORDABLE THAT WAY EVERY ONE IN THE WORLD CAN USE IT LONG LINES OF HEALTH I THINK THE GLASSES WILL ALSO POTENTIALLY SOLV A MAJOR PROBLEM IN A IN A REAL WAY WHICH IS THE FOLLOWING A FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS ITS VERY CLEAR THAT VIEWING OBJECTS IN PARTICULAR SCREENS UP CLOSE FOR TOO MANY HOURS PERDAY LEADS TO MYOPIA LITLY I LTERALLY CHANGE IN THE LENGTH IN A LENGTH OF THE EYEBALL AND NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IM AND ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WE KNOW BASED ON SOME REALLY LARGE CLINICAL TRIALS IM THAT KIDS WHO SPEND AND ADULTS WHO SPEND TWO HOURS A DAY OR MORE OUT OF DOORS IM DON'T EXPERIENCE THAT AND MAYBE EVEN REVERSE THER MYOPIAND IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH EXPOSURE TO SUNLIGHT BUT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH LONG VIEWING VOING THINGS AT A DISTANCE GREATER THAN THREE OR FOUR FEET AWAY AND WITH THE GLASSES I REALIZE ONE COULD ACTUALLY DO DID GITAL WORK OUT OF DOORS I IT COULD MEASURE AND TELL YOU HOW MUCH TIME YOU'VE SPENT LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE VERSES FAR AWAY I MEAN IT THIS JUS 'S ANOTHER EXEXAMPLE IT LEAPS TO MINE BUT IN IN ACCESSING THE VISUAL SYSTEM YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY ACCESSING THE WHOLE BRAIN BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY TWO BITS OF BRAIN THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE CRANIAL VAULT SO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE PUTTING TACHKNOLEGY RIGHT AT THE LEVEL OF THE EYES SEEING WHAT THE EYES SEE IS JUST GOT TO BE THE BEST WAY TO GO YE I THINK WLL MULTIMOTIL REH I THINK IS YOU WANT THE VISUAL SENSATION BUT YOU ALSO AN CONT OF TEXT OR LANGUAGE SO SIR II THINK IT'S THAT ALL CAN BE BROUGHT TO THE LEVEL OF THE EYES WOULD YOU BE WELL I MEAN I THINK WWE'RE DESCRIBING HERE IS A SENTIALLY TAKING THE PHONE THE COMPUTER IM AND BRINGIG IT ALL TO THE LEVEL OF THE EYES AND OF COURSE ONE WOULD LIKE MISICALLY A PHYSICALLY AT YOUR EYES RIGHT YE AND ONE WOULD LIKE MORE A'M CENESTHETIC INFORMATION AS YOU LE ME FOR WHERE THE LEGS ARE MAYBE LONG FUNCTION HAH HAVE YOU TAKEN ENOUGH STEPS TO DAY BUT YET THAT ALL CAN BE IF IT CAN BE FIGGRED OUT ON THE PHONE IT CAN BE BY THE PHONE IT CAN BE FIGURED OUT B THE GLASSES IM BUT THERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THERE SUCH AS WHAT AR YOU FOCASSING ON IN YOUR WORLD HOW MUCH OF YOUR TIME IS SPENT LOOKING AT THINGS FAR AWAY VERSES UP CLOSE HOW MUCH SOCIAL TIME DID YOU HAVE TODAY S IT'S REALLY TRICKY TO GET THAT WITH A PHONE LIKE THEY GIVE MY PHONE WRIGHT IN FRONT OF US AS IF WE WERE AT A STANDARD LUNCH NOWADAYS CERTAINLY I SILLICON VALUE AND THEN PEOPLE WERE PEERING AT OUR PHONES AN MEEN HOW MUCH REAL DIRECT ATTENTION AND WAS IN THE CONVERSATION AT HAND VERSES SOMETHING ELSE ME CAN GET IS SHUES OF WHERE ARE YOU PLACING YOUR ATTENTION IM BY VIRTUE WHERE YOU'RE PLACING YOUR EYES AND I THINK THAT INFORMATION IS NOT ACCESSIBLE WITH A PHONE IN YOUR POCKET OR IN FRONT OF YOU YM IN THAT A LITTLE BIT IM BUT NOT NEARLY AS RICH A IN COMPLETE INFORMATION AS ONE GETS WHEN YOU REALLY PULLING THE DATA FROM THE LEVEL OF OF VISION AND WHAT WHAT KIDS AND ADULTS ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT AN ATTENDING TO YE YE YES THAT IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE IM YOU GET OTONOMIC INFORMATION SIZE OF THE PUPILS S YOU GET INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNAL STATES I'MEAN THAT YOU GVES THERE'S INTERNAL CENSOR AND OUTSIDE SO THERE'S THE CENSOR ON THE RAYBAND META GLASSES IS EXTERNAL RITZERD SPASCA ALLOWS YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU SEE THEN LIVESIS I THE A I ASSISTENT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE'S A SEPARATE SET OF THINGS WHITH YOU'RE EYE TRACKING IM WHICH A ORE ELSEA VERY POWERFUL IM FOR ENABLING A LOT OF INTERFACES WHEREIT'S A YOU ON IT IF YOU UNDER JUST LIKE LOOK AT SOMETHING AND SELECT IT BY LOOKING AT IT WITH YOUR EYES RATHER A AVEN'T O KND OF DRAG A CONTROLLER OVER OR PICK UP A HOLEGRAM OR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN DO THAT WITH IYE TRACKING IM SO THAT'S A PRETTY PROFOUND AND IN COOL EXPERIENCE TOO IM IS WELL IS JUST CIUND OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING ATS THAT WE A'RE NOT CAN A WASTIN COMPUTE POWER DRAWING PICSLES IN HIGH RESOLUTION A PART OF THE KIND OF WORLD THAT YOURE OT THAT'S CAN BE IN YOUR PERFERAL VISION IM SEE IALL O THESE THINGS IM THEY'RE INTERESTING DESIGN IN TACHNOLEGY TRIDE OFFS WHERE IF YOU WANT THE EXTERNAL CENSER THAT'S ONE THING IF YOU ALSO WANT THE EYE TRACKING IMNOW TIT'S A DIFFERENT SET OF CENSORS EACH ONE OF THESE IM CONSUMES COMPUTE WHICH CONSUMES BATTERY I THEY TAKE UP MORE SPACE OR ITS ITS A WERE ARE THE EYE TRACKING CENSORS CAN BE IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU WANT A MAKE SURE OF THE RIM OF THE GLASSES IS ACTUALLY QUITE THIN BECAUSE AM IN IT'S AND IF THERE'S A CONAVARIANCE OF YOUR HOW THICK CAN GLASSES BE BEFORE THEY LOOK MORE LIKE GOGGLES THAN GLASSES I THING THAT THIS IS THEREIS THIS WHOLE SPACE AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE AN END OF CHOOSING WHAT PRODUCT MAKE SENSE FOR THEM MAYE THEY WANTS AN THAT'S MORE POWERFUL THAT AS MORE THE CENSERS IM BUT IT'S BUT IT'S CAN BE A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE MAY BE LIKE SLIGHTLY THICKER IM OR MAYBE WANT LIKE A MORE BASIC THING THAT JUST LOOKS LIKE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT RAYBAND GLASSES ARE THAT PEOPLE BEEN WEARING FOR DEKADES BUT CON HAS A EYE IN IT AND YOU CAN CAPTURE MOMENTS IM WITHOUT HIM TO TAKE YOUR PHONE OUT AND SEND THEM TO PEOPLE IN THE LATEST VERSION WE GOT THE ABILITY IN TO LIE LIVE STREAM THNG AT THAT'S PRETTY CRAZY THAT NOW YOU CAN BE KIND OF YOU'RE GOING BACK YOUR CONCERT CASE OR AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU'RE DOING YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE IM AN DOING SPORTS AND AND JUST AR WATCHING YOUR KIDS PLAY SOMETHING AND AND JUST YOU CAN BE WATCHING AND YOU BE LIVE STREAMING IT YOUR YOU'RE CON FAMILY GROUP I'M SOME PEOPLE CAN SEE IT I ITHIMPATIKE THAT STUFF IS IM II'V THAT'S PRTCOOL THAT YOU PIST HAVE A NORMAL LOOKING PAIR OF GLASSES AT THIS POINT THAT CAN COUNT OF LIVE STREAM AND N HAS LIKE AN A I ASSISTANCE SI THAT THE STUFF IS MAKING A LOT FASTER PROGRESS IN A LOT OF WAYS THAN I WOULD A THOUGHT M AND A I THINK PEOPLE CAN A LIKE THIS VERSION BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE STILL TO DO I THINK IT'S SUPEREXCITING AND I SEE A LOT TICNOLODGIES THIS ONE'S PARTICULARLY EXCITE KNO ME BECAUSE OF HOW SMOOTHTHE INTERFACE IS AND FOR ALL THE REASONS TAT YOU JUST MENTIONED IM WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH AND WHAT CAN WE EXPECT AROUND A I INTERFACES AND MAYBE EN AVATARS OF PEOPLE WITHIN SOCIAL MEDIA ARE WE I'M NOT FAR OFF FROM A DAY WHERE THERE ARE MULTIBLE VERSIONS OF ME AND YOU ON THE EARNET WHERE PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE I GAN ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS I DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY RESPOND ALL THOSE QUESTIONS BUT I'M WIT THINGS LIKE CHATCH P T PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GENERATY ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS ON OTHER YY ATFORMS WILL I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SOON HAVE AN A I VERSION OF MYSELF WHERE PEOPLE CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT LIKE WHAT I RECOMMEND FOR SLEEP IN CIRCADIAN RHYTHM FITNESS MENTAL HEALTH ET CETERA BASED ON CONTENT HAVE ALREADY GENERATED THAT WILL BE ACCURATE SAY GO JUS ASK MY AVATAR YE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK A LOT OF CREATORS ARE GIN A WANT THAT I'M THET WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD I'M AND I THINK WE'LL PROBLY HAVE AVERSION OF NEXT YEAR BUT THERE'S A BUNCH OF CONSTRAINTS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET RIGHT SO FOR ONE ITHNK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S A BUNCH OF VERSIONS OF YOU IT'S THAT IF ANY ONE IS CREATING THEK AN A I ASSISTANT VERSION OF YOU IT SHOULD BE SOMETING YOU CONTROL RIGHT IT'S I'M I THINK THERE'SE SOME PLATFORMS THERE OUT THERE TO DAY THAT JUST LET PEOPLE LIKE A MAKE NO TA A I BOT O ME OR OTHER FIGURES IN IT'S LIKE  I DON'TKNOW IMAND WE WE HAVE PLATFORM POLICIES FOR I'M VOR LIKE DECADES I IA SINCE THE BEGININGOF THE COMPANY AT THIS POINT WHICH IS ALMOST TWENTY YEARS THAT IM THAT BASICALLY DON'T ALLOW IMPERSONATION I'M YOU NOW REAL IDENTITY IS LIKE ONE OF THE CORASPECTS THAT THAT CON OF OUR COMPANY WAS WAS STARTED ON AS LIKE YOU WANT O CAN AUTHENTICALLY BE YOURSELF SO I'M YI I THINK IF YOU'RE IF YO'E ALMOST ANY CREATOR BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE YOUR COMMUNITY AND THERE'S JUS GOIN O BE MORE DEMAND INTERACT WITH YOU THAN YOU HAVE HOURS IN THE DAY SO THERERE BOTH PEOPLE WHO OUT THERE WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO TALK TO AN A IVERSION OF YOU IM AND I THINK YOU AN OTHER CREATORS WOULD BENEFIT FROM BENGABLE TO KEEP YOUR COMMUNITY ENGAGED IN IN SERVICE THAT  DEMAND THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU BUT YOU'RE GONG TO ONE TO KNOW THAT THAT A I CON AVERSION OF YOU OR ASSISTANT I'M IS GOING TO REPRESENT YOU THE WAY T AT YOU WOULD WANT AND I'M THERE'RE LOT OFTHNGS THAT ARE OSSOME ABOUT CONE OF THESE MODERN ALILEMS BUT HAVING PERFECT PREDICTABILITY ABOUT HOW IT'S CAN TO REPRESENT SOMETHING IS NOT ONE OF THE CURRENT STRENGTHS SO IK KNOW THERE'S SOME WORK THAT NEDS TO GET DONE THERE I DO'T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT ALL THE TIME BUT YOU NEEDS HAVE VERY GOOD CONFIDENCE I WOULDE SAY THAT IT'S GOING TO THAT'S GOIN TO REPRESENT YOU THE WAY THAT YOU'D WANT FOR YOU TO WANT TA TURN IT ON IM WHICH AGAIN YOU SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OVER WHETHER YOU TURN IT ON I SO WE WONTE TO START IN A DIFFERENT PLACE WHICH I THING IS A SOMEWHAT I'M EAS YOUR PROBLEM WHICH IS CREATING NEW CHARACTERS THAT THE FOR ER A I PORSONE AS O THAT WAY IT'S NOT IM IN A WE WE BUILT YOU ONE OF THE A EYES IS LIKE A CHEF AND I'M THEY CAN HELP YOU CON COME UP WITH THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD THAT YOU COULD COOK AND CAN HELP YOU COOK THEM I' THERE'S LIKE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT AR INTEREST IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF FITNESS THAT CAN HELP YOU CAN A PLAN OUT YOUR WORK OUTS OR OUN HELP WITH RECOVERY YOURE DIFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT 'M THEY'RE PEOPLE THER'S AN A IYE THAT'S FOCUSED ON LIKE DE IWY CRAFTS IM THERE'S SOMEON Y'S A TRAVEL EXPERT THAT CAN HELP YOU MAKE TRAVEL PLANS OR R GIVE YOU IDEA SO BUT THE KEYTHING OUT ALL THESE IS THEY'RE NOT M THEY'RE NOT MODELLED OFF OF EXISTING PEOPLE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE KIND OF A HUNDRED PER CENT FIDELITY TO LIKE MAKING SURE THAT THEY NEVER SAY SOMETHING THAT YOUKNOW A REAL PERSON WHO THERE MODELED AFTER WOULD NEVER SAY BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST MADE UP CHARACTERS SO AND THA THAT IS IM THAT' A SOMEONEY EASIER PROBLEM I'M IN WE ACTULLY GOT THE WE GOT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT KIND OF WELL KNOWN PEOPLE TO PLAY THOSE CHARACTERS BECAUSE WE THOUGH THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE FUN SO THERE'S LIKE SNOOP DOG IS THE DUNGEON MASTERS YOU CAN LIKE DROP HIM INTO A THREAD IN PLIGHT TEX BASED GAMES AND IT JUST LIKE I DO THIS WITH MY DAUGHTER WHEN I WHEN I AM TUCK HER IN AT NIGHT AND SHE JUST LIKE LOVES I LIKE LIKE STORY TELLING RIGHT IN IT'S LIKE ILEC THE SNOOP DOG IS THE DUNGEON MASTER WILL COME UP WITH LIKE HEARS WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT AND IS LIKE OOCAN I LIKE TURN INTO A MERMAID AND THEN I LIKE SWIM ACROSS THE BAY AND I THAT GO AND FIND THE THE TREASURE CHEST AND UNLOCK IT IT'S LIKE AND THENSNOOP DOG JUST ALWAYS WILL HAVE AN NEXT VERSION OF THE LIKE THE NEXT TETERATION ON THE STORY SO AND IT'S IT STUFF AS FUN BUT ON IT'S NOT ACTUU SNOOP DOG HE'S JUST KIND OF THE ACTERS PLAYING THE DUNGEON MASTER WHICH MAKES IT MORE FUN SO I  THAT'S PRARTHER RIGHT PLACE TO START IS YOU HAVE LIKE UYOU CAN CONT OF BUILD VERSIONS OF THESE CHARACTERS THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN INTERACT WITH DOING DIFFERENT THINGS BUT I THINK WHAT YOU WANT TO GET OVER TIME IS TO THE PLACE WHERE ANY CREATOR OR ANY SMALL BUSINESS CAN VERY EASILY JUST CREAT IN A I ASSISTANT THAT CAN REPRESENT THEM AN INTERACT WITH YOUR KIND OF COMMUNITY OR CUSTOMERS IF YOU'RE BUSINESS IM IN IN BASICALLY JUST HELP YOU GROW YOUR YOU'RENT SURPRISE SO II THINK THAT'S CYPICUAL BUT I ITHINS IT'S A LONG TURN PROJECT I THNK WE'LL HAVE MORE PROGRESS ONNETS REPORT ON NEXT YEAR BUT AM BUTI THINK THAT'S COMING I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT BECAUSE I YOU DON'T WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE DOWNSIDES OF A I MAN I THINK PEOPLE ARE NOW COMING AROUND TO THE ET THE REALITY THAT A IY IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD IT CAN BE USE FOR GOOD OR BAD AND THAT THERE LOT OF LIFE ENHANCING SPACE IS THAT IT'S

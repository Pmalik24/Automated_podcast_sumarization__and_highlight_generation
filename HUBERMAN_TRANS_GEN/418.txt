WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAD GUEST SERIES WHERE I AND AN EXPERT GUEST I GUST SCIENCE AN SCIENCE AC WHO PERAN I MAD YOUR HUBERMEN AND 'M O PROFESSOR OF NEURBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TODAY'S EPISODE MARKS THE SIXTH AND FINAL OF THE SIXTH EPISODE SERIES ON FITNESS EXERCISE AND PERFORMANCE AND TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS ALL ABOUT NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION TO MAXIMISE YOUR FITNESS EXERCISE AND PERFORMANC SCHOOLS DOCTOR ANTO YALPAN I'M SUPER EXCITED TO DISCUSS TO DAY'S TOPIC WHICH IS NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION FOR PERFORMANCE AND RECOVERY AND I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN SUPPLEMENTATION AND NUTRITION PER PERFORMANCE REALLY SINCE MY TEENS BUT ALSO BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE WITNESS A MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THEIR VIEW OF SUPPLEMENTATION AND NUTRITION FIRST OF ALL MORE PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT NUTRITION WHAT IS GOOD NUTRITION WHAT IS NOT A VERY BARBED WIRE TOPIC AS YOU KNOW BUT THERE ARE SOME TRUTHS IN THERE THAT WILL DISCUSS BUT ALSO SUPPLEMENTATION YOU KNOW WHEREAS TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I THINK MOST PEOPLE  WOULD EITHER BE REALLY INTO SUPPLEMENTS THAT WAS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE BUT TH MAJORITY OF PEOPLE A WE'RE EITHER TOLD OR WERE THINKING OH YOUNOVITEMENS YOU MOSTLY SCREET THEM THEI'RE JUSTEXPENSIVE URINE NOWADAYS IT SEEMS THAT MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AN PHYSICIANS ALL THE WAY DOWN TOS SPORTS PERFORMANCE EXPERTS ARE TAKING AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS AND SO THE WAY THAT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS IS THAT THEY AREN'T NECESSARILY JUST SUPPLEMENTS WHICH MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THEY ARE AUGMENTING WHAT SHOULD ALREADY BE THERE BUT YOU'RE NOT QUITE GETTING ENOUGH OF BUT INDEED A LOT OF THESE THINGS WE CALL SUPPLEMENTS ARE VERY POTENT COMPOUNDS THAT CAN TRANSFORM OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM IN THE SHORT TERM TO RECOVER FROM EXERCISE AND THAT CAN REALLY SHAPE BRAIN CHEMISTRY HORMONE PATTERNS ACUTELY AND WHEN TAKEN LONG TERM SO 'M VERY EXCITE ABOUT TO DAYS TOPIC AND TO BE ABLE TO TRYING SORT THROUGH THIS CALL IT A CLOUD HOPFULLY NOT A STORM BUT THIS CLOUD OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE BECAUSE INDEED MANY OF THEM ARE EXCELLENT AND CAN PEORVIDE US A LOT SOME OF THEM ARE TERRIBLE AND THEN SOME JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING AND THEREFORE ARE TERRIBLE BECAUSE I EITHER THEY AVECITE A FACTS OR BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE HEN THY DON'T DO ANYTHING AND THEN OF COURSE WITHIN THE REALM OF NUTRITION THERE'S AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF OF CONFUTION BUT THAT'S WHY M TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE GOIN TO PUT CLARITY AND STRUCTURE AND DEFINITION ON THESE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPICS YOU YOU ABSOLUTLY NAILED AT THERE ONE OF THE MAJOR REAS AN SUPPLEMENTS CAN WORK IS BECAUSE YOU CAN CONSUME NUTRIANS IN EXTREMELY HIGH CONCENTRATION SUCH THAT YOU WOULD NOT GET IN NATURE THROUGHHAVING SAID THAT YOU REALLY DO WANT A FOCUSS ON THE BASIC SLEEP NUTRITION HYDRATION AND I'M GOING TO GET INTO VERY SPECIFIC DETAIL LATER WITH SOME OF THOSE THINGS THATS SAID THERE ARE PLENTY OF SITUATIONS AN CIR C UMSTANCES WHIN SUPPLEMENTATION CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID ALSO THOUGH BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING THEM IN SUCH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS THEY CAN ALSO BE UNPRODUCTIVE THEY CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE OR THEY CAN BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE SO IN CASE IF YOURE TAKING A COUPLE OF SUPPLEMENTS OVER HERE IT MAY ACTUALLY BE COUNTERACTING THE BENEFITS OF SOMEBO THE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS OVER THERE SO IN THE IDEAL SITUATION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK LIKE A SNIPERS HERE SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO RUN FULL BIOLOGICAL TESTING SO EXTENS IFE BLOOD WORK AND SALIVA AND YEARN AND STOOL AND HAVE A INDEPTHANALYSIS OF YOUR GOT MY CROPI OM AND YOUR STREST PATTERNS TAND YOUR TIME OF DAY AN YOUR CARTERS ALL CURVE AND LIKE ALL THE THINGS THA WE DO IN OUR HIGH PERFORMANCE FOLKS WITH THAT THEN WE CAN GET EXTREMELY HIGH PRECISION SUPPLEMENTATION AND IN QUITE ONESTLY OUR PHILOSOPHY IS WE ONLY GIVE INDIVIDUALS EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED SO EVEN SOME OF THE STANDARD A GENERALLY SAFE AN EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTS WE DON'T REALLY NECESSARILY USE THEM IF THERE'S NO SPECIFIC NEED A WE TALKED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WITH THINGS LIKE ANTIOXID INS BUT EVEN A SIMPLE STUFF LIKE STIMULANS AND OTHER TOOLS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE FOR RECOVERY WE DON'T USE THEM UNLESS WE HAVE A REASON THAT' SAID THAT'S NOT THE REALITY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT CN BEABLE TO DO SUMETHING LIKE THAT OR WORKS SOMEBODY CAN HELP THEM IN THAT SO THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE MY MY EIGHTY TWENTY RULEWITS IS SORT ALIKE THE TWENTY PER CSENT A SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE GONG TO GIVE YOU EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE BENEFIT FOR THE LOWEST COST AND SO WHAT I CAN ACTA USE THE SORT OFSTART THERE EVEN KNOW THIS BURNS MY SKIN AN MY SOUL A LITTLE BIT I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS I AM THE CONTEXT GU I'M THEIT IT DEPENDS ITS HIGH PRECISION GUY BUT LET'S BE REAL AM THERE ARE NUMBER OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE FAIRLY EFFECTIVE AND FAIRLY CHEAP FOR A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES A SO THIS IS FOR GENERAL PUBLIC THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THE THREE BUCKETS RIGHT YOU WANT A LOOK A CERTAIN WAY SO SUPPLEMENTS THAT COULD IN HANDS MUSCLE GROWTH AND FATLOS A NONE HORMONAL BE SUPPLEMENTS OF COURSE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN IMPROVE ENERGY OR PHYSICAL PERFORMANTS AGAIN FROM EVERYTHING FROM YO SQUATTING MORE TO FEELING BETTER IN YOUR YOGA CLASS TO HAVING LEENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO OUR THIRD MAJOR BUCKET THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THROUS TE DIRE SERIES WHICH OUR LONGGEVITY SO WE CAN COVER THOSE FIRST IF YOU LIKE TO START THERE YES ABSOLUTELY LET'S START THERE OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE THINK OF SUPPLEMENTS WE IMMEDIATELY JUMP TO HIGH SPORT PERFORMANCE TYPE OF THINGS OR VIGOROUS WORK OUTS OR OR MUSCLE BUILDING THO THT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE THE CASE A TAKE FOR EXAMPLE CREATING 'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS AT LENGTHINS WIT THE AREN GARRIN CANADA WHOSE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH I WAS TO ST UP AT HIS LAB RECENTLY IN CANADA AND HE HAS COVERED EXTENSIVELY IN FACT I I THINK I PUT UP A POST PERHAPS I COULD DRYW THIS UP UN WHERE HE LAID OUT ALL THE MYRIAD OF BENEFITS OF CREATING THIS IS TAKEN IN THE YOUR TYPICALLY THREE TO FIVE GRAHMS PER DAY OF THOSE OF CREATING ON O HIGHDRATE WHICH HAS THE MOST RESTRICT BEHIND IT A SEEMS TO BE EXTREMELY LOW SIDE EFFECTS IN ALMOST ANYONE AND THE BENEFITS INCLUDING COURSE THINGS LIKE A MUSCLE PERFORMANCE AND STRENGTH AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND IF YOU GO BACK TO OUR DISCUSSION ANRE EPISODE ON METABOLISM AND AN ENDURANCE WE TALKED ABOUT THE PHOSPHEL CRETING SYSTEMS E YOU CAN FIGURE OUT KIND OF WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IN TRIMS OF EFFECT THAT'S SAID THERE IS EXCELLENT INFORMATION AND DATA COMING OUT NON ON THE BENEFITS OF BONMENRAL DENSITY IN CREATING A TERE'S A TON OF WORK LOOKING AT A HOST OF COGNITIVE FACTORS AM FROM MEMORY EXECUTIVE FUNCTION A TO EFFECTS POTENTIALLY ON EVEN THINGS LIKE DEPRESSION A MOOD TO ALL SIMERS PARKENSONS A ALL FORMS OF OF NOURGE ENERATIV DISEASE A IN FACT IT ITS PRETTY OBVIOUS THE BRAIN LOVES CRETING AS A FUEL AND SO NOT ONLY WE SORT OF DISCUSSED IN THE EPISODE AS BEING THE FUEL FOR SKELLET O MUSCOTRACTION BUT THE BRAIN NEEDS TO DO THAT AS WELL THE ASTROCITES AREOUN THE BRAIN EED BE O THE RIGHT ENERGY AT CITRA SO IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT METABOLISM IN THE BRAIN IS REDUCED WITH THINGS LIKE T B E AND POTENTIALLY CONCUSSIONS SO A NOW TO BE EXTREMELY CLEAR CRETIN DOES NOT PREVENT ANY OF THOSE DISEASES IT DOES NOT TREAT ANY OF THEM AND THE DATA ARE MIXED BUT IT'S MORE AND MORE OUR COMING A SOME SHOW A LITTLE BIT O BENEFIT SOME SHOW OU KNO MAY BE NONE BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY RESEARCH IN THOSE AREAS THAT SHOW IT HAS ANY DOWNSIDE I FOR THE MOST PART SIDE EFFECTS ARE EXTREMELY MENIMAL IF NOT NOL AND THEN POTENTIALLY SOME BENEFIT INDEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC STUDYE SO WE COULD PUT UP A IF YOU LIKE A COUPLE OF LENGTHS DIRECTLY TO THOSE METANALSIES D AND BBOOKS CAN GO THROUGH THOSE THINGS ONE BY ONE SO I I ONLY SAY THAT TO AGAIN MAY BE EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OR THINKING ABOUT WHAT THESE SYPSO SUPPLEMENTS CAN DO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GROWING MUSCLE AR A NO HIGH PERFORMANCE ITS EVEYTHING TO AGANTERS AN ASSOCIATION WITH RECOVERY A SO CREATING IS FANTASTIC FOR RECOVERY FROM MUSCLE FROM MUSCLE DAMAGE I HELPS AND INCANPETENTIALLY ADE IN FAT LOST AND A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY ALSO EVEN LOOK ATS WEBSLDES LIKE EXAMINED DOT COM I HAVE YOU NO AFFILIATION WIT THEN WHATSOEVER BUT IF YOU WANT A DISTYPE IN SOMETHING LIKE CREATIN ON A HYDRADE I YOU CAN SEE A WHOLE LIST AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THOUSANDS OF STUDIES OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF CREATING SO THAT IS IS ALWAYS NUMBER ONE ON MY LIST I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT CREATING SITS AT THE TOP OF YOUR SUPPLEMENTATION LIST BECAUSE WELL FIRST OF ALL I STARTED TAKING IT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AT THAT TIME I WAS TAKING IT IN THIS KIND OF LOADING MODE WHERE YOU TAKE IT IN AM YOU KNOW ANYWHERE FROM FIFTEENED A TWENTY FIVE GRAHAMS PER DAY OFTEN CAUSING SOME GASTRIC DISTRESS OFTEN COMBINING WITH FRUIT JEIS TO TRY AND SHUTTLE INTO THE MUSCLES OR AND THEN SO CALED MAINTENANCE PHASE OF REDUCING TO TEN OR FIFTEEN GRAHMS PER DAY A NOWADAYS I JUST TAKE ABOUT FIVE GRAHAMS OR SO A THE LATER I KNOW YOURE GIN TELL ME WHY I SHOULD PROBABLY BE TAKING MORE THAN FIVE GRAHMS PER DAY GIVENG MY BODY WEIGHT AND WEILL GET INTO SOME OF THOSE SPECIFIC SELUBIT LATER BUT IN ADDITION TO EXPERIENCING DIRECT EFFECTS ON A MUSCLE SIZE AND STRENGTH WHICH I DID T I DON'T KNOW HOW IT CONTRIBUTED TO MY COGNIVE FUNCTION OR IF IT DOES NOW BECAUSE IE'S REALLY NOWEIGHTED TEES THAT OUT WITH IT WITH STANDARD AM AAT HOME TESTS LIKE A SCALE A BUT IT IS VERY CLEAR TO ME BASED ON THE LITERATURE A THAT YOU DESCRIBED AND I'M SOME OF WHICH WE'VE COVERED ON OTHER EPISODES OF THE PODCAST THAT THE PHOSPHOR CREATIUNE SYSTEM IS VIDELY IMPORTANT FOR FORBRAIN FUNCTION I THE FORBRANOF CORSE BEING THE THE A PORTION OF BRAIN A BROADLY SPEAKING THE PORTION OF BRAIN JUST BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD THAT IS A RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING ACTION SETTING RULES IN CONTACT SO AM EVEN AS SIMPLE AS IF YOURE GOING DOWN FIELD AN A GAME OF SOCKER BASKET BALL AND YOUR OWN OFFENSE AND THEN A YOU MAKE AN ATTEMPT ON GOAL OR BASKET AND THEN IT'S SWITCHES AND YOU GO BACK NOW YOUR ON DEFENSE THAT IT'S BEING ON DEFENCE IS VERY DIFFREN THAN BEING ON OFFENSE AND THAT GOLS EXCUSE ME THAT THAT RULE SWITCHING IS A PREFUNTAL CUORTICAL FUNCTION AS IS EVERY CONTECT DEPENDENT WAY OF THINKING OR WERE ACTING AND SO ANYTHING THAT CAN FAVOR FUNCTION OF THE FOREBRAIN I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR A HUMANS IN GENERAL IT SUPPRESSES ANXIETY ALLOWS US TO INTERPRET WHAT'S GOING ON FOR US AND SO I'M VERY AM RELIEVED AND GRATIFY TO HEAR THAT CREETING SITS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST ALSO AS A SURE YOU'LL POINT OUT AGAIN LEADER CREETING IS FOR THE MOST PART OF RELATIVELY AF FORTABLE SOPPLEMENT PROMOST PEOPLE SO HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THA'S RULY ASO TERRIC OR THAT Y AFTO YOU KNOW FLYTE I'M SOME REMOTE LOCATION TO GET IN INFUSION OF RAM BUT THO I APOLOGIZE ALL YOU CAUSE I KNOW THE PRICE HAS KYROCKETED RECENTLY REALLY YE WHY IS THAT I THINK IT'S US NOBODY KNOWS BUT IT'S CORNONCODO SUPPLYING AND A DEMAND ISSUE IF YOU WILL SO A THOSE PRICES HAVE GONE OUP THOS ALSO OF COURSE BEEN SHIPPING PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD AND THING SO I EVERY TIME I I TALK ABOUT CRATING MY NOW PEOPLE JUST FLAME ME FUR LIKE O I GOT A SILKESPENSIVE NO IMIC I AM SORRY BUT HONESTLY IT'S ONLY SO EXPENSIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE USE TO BEING SO CHEAP SO WHEN U WHEN YOU COUNTER THE FACT BOUTER YOU LIKE RIGHT YE LIKE RELATIVE TO THE OTHER STOFF YOURE PROBABLY TAKING RELATIVE TO ANY OTHER NUMBER OF PURCHASES A FOR THE IT STILL LANDS VERY HIGH N MY ARROWILESS MY O MI AIT TWANTY BECAUSE OF THAT IS IT'S IT CAN BE TAKEN ANY TIME OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN MAGICAL COMBINATION YOU TALKED ABOUT COINJESTING WITH CARBOHYDRATES THT CANNON HANDS HOW QUICKLY CAN GET INTO SYSTEM IN FACT THAT IT'S GOT A WORK ON THE EXACTSING AS IN  MECHANISMS WILL PROBABLY I PUTNENT IO TALK ABOUT HYDRATION BUT THESE THINGS ARE SHUTTLED SO ANY TIME YOUR BRINGING CARBOHYDRA THAT'S GOING TO BE SHIP INTO TISSUE AS QUICKLY AS IT CAN I CREETIN THAN GOES LONGS FOR THE RIGHT AND THN IT BRINGS WATER FOR R THAT HI YOU IN HANDS HYDRATION THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE CARBOHYDRATES WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO HYDRATE SO YOU D'S CAN TAKE IT IN THEREAND THAT'S ALSO WHY YOU GET CONICALSELF SWELLING  WHICH IS A GOOD THING I YOUR IT'S JUST AN HANSING HYDRATION WE ACTIAL USE AT A TON IN OUR POST WAY IN PROTOCALS SO AN INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO CUT WATERWEIGHT CREACHINGS A GREAT THING TO THROW BACK IN THERE'S CIN I HELP YOU REHYDRATE IT'S ALSO WHY WHEN YOU TAKE THIRTY GRAMS OF IT IT CAN PULL A BUNCH OF FLUID IN THE INTESTINS AND AND THERE YOU GO IT HROUGH LITTLE BIT OF GI DISTRESS SO  YET IS A LOT OF FUN THINGS YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THERE I JUS HAD TO FLAG THAT BECAUSE EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN TOCKING ABOUT A RECENTLY AND I SAY IT'S CEP PEOPLE KILLING ME FOR IT SO I APOLOGISE I DON'T NOW HOW TO MAKE ATIN CEEPER BUT IT'S STILL FAIRLY FAIRLY AFFORDABLE I WOULD SAY RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE COMPARED TO A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS OUT THERE AND WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS A IT'S QUITE GOOD YES ALEC ACTUALLY SARRY SARRY COY UP BUT I WAS ALSO THINKING THERE'S BEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES ON I SLEEP TUPRVTIONS WEALTH CRATING THERE CAN HELP SO OBGOUSLY SLEEP DEPROBATION WILL GENERALLY REDOUCE COGNG TO FUNCTION AND CRETING CAN AMILIARATE SUME OF THAT DROP SO IF YOU THNK ABOUT IN THAT CONTEXT I HAD A CRUMMY NIGHT ASLEEP WELL AN EFFECT ENABLES YOU D PERFORM A LITTLE BUT BETTERIN YOUR JOB THAN YOUD  MAKE UP THE DOLLAR OR SO WHATEVER YOU PAID FOR THAT DAYS SUPPLY OF CREETING SO IT IS SOMETHING I CANNOT ON THAT NOTE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK AS AN ACUTE RESPONSE SO'S NOT SOMETHINGYO'RE LIKE I FEEL TERRIBLE AND THROW SOME CRETINE DOWN THE HATCH I'LL FEEL BETTER THAT THAT'S NOCK IN A WORK IT'S GOING TO TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO HAVE A NOTICEABLE EFFECT THAT NEEDS TO BE STORED IN TISSUE I NEES TO BE BUILT UP BEFORE YOU CAN NACTION DO MUCH OF ANYTHING SO IT IS UNLIKE SOMETHING OTHER THINGS LIKE STEMULINS OR CAFFINE THAT HAVEAN ACUTE RESPONSE RIGHT NOW AND SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT YOU PROBABLY NEED TO CONSUME IT CONSISTENTLY IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT THAN REALY THERE'S NO POINT AN DOING IT I'N THE LOADING PHASE YOU MENTION DISTANCE WERE HERE ITIS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO AGAIN IF YOU NEED YOU IN HANDS THE STORAGE OF IT REALLY QUICKLY SO SAYE FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE DONE THIS IN SOME MILITARY CASES WHEREIS LIKE YOU GET BACK TO BASE AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT A WEEK AND YOU GOT O GO BACK OUT WE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE TO I DO THE A BIT OF LOADING FACE THAN BUT IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE I THE LOADING FASES UNNECESSARY IT'S NOT REALY HARMFUL OTHER THAN MAY BE GIASTRESS AND MAYBE WAS BUT YOU GOING TO HAVE THREE OR FOUR WEEK IT'S GETING TO REACH FULL SATURATION PLAIN TIME TO TO BE THERE IND THAT IF YOU'RE NOT THREE TO SEVEN GRAMS FOR DAY ARRANGE I'M GLAD YOU MENTION THE SLOW ACCUMULATING POSIVE EFFECTS OF CREETING AS COMPARED TO SO CALLED ACUTE EFFECTS BECAUSE THE WAY THA I THINK OF HEALTH PROMOTING A PERFORMANCE ENHANCING PROTOCALS LIKE VIEWING MORNING SUNLIGHT OR AM ENDURANCE EXERCISE FOR THAT MATTER OR CREATINE OR SLEEP FOR INSTANCE IS THAT WHILE THEY CAN HAVE EFFECTS IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM YOU MIGHT FEEL A LITTLE BIT OR IN THE CASE OF A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP A LOT BETTER IT'S TRULY THE CUMULAVE EFFACT OF RASING YOUR BASE LINE LEVELY FUNCTIONING THE OTHERE'S AANOTHER WAY THINK ABOUT IS AM THESE SUPPLEMENTS OUR BEHAVIOURS AM AND QUALITY NUTRITION WHEN DONE CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN A HUNDRED PER CENT TO THE TIME BUT YOU KNOW THIT'S ALL THE EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE TIME SUR LEAD TO A SORT OF A BUOYANCY IN YOUR SYSTEM THIT ALLOWS YOU TO BE MORE RESILIANT UNDER CONDITIONS A WHERE CONDITIONS AREN'T PERFECT RIGHT AND IF CONDITIONS ARE MADE PERFECT OR CLOSE TO PERFECT AND YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT BUOYANCY THAT'S WHEN YOURE REALLY STRART TO SE THE ULTRA HIGH PERFORMANCE EFFECTS UM THAT ARE SO MUCH FUN BUT THEY HAVE TO BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH CONSISTEN SUPPLEMENTATION CONSISTENT NUTRITIONAL ONE TAKES SO TO DAY I KNOW WE'RE GOING YO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ANORMALLY THE'RECALLED CHRONIC AND ACUTE EFFECTS BUT THAT YOUNG THT MAKES A SOUND LIKE CHRONIC ILLNESSTHE MOMEN PEOPLE HERE CHRONIC WHILE THEY MIGHT THINK OF OTHER THINGS BUT BUT IN THE CONTECTS OF HEALTH THEY TYPICALLY THINK OF YOU KNOW CHRONIC ILLNESS ANDWERE NOT SAYING ABOUT THAT WILL RETALLING ABOUT IS SLOW MODULATORY OF FACTS IN THE BODY A LOT OF THINGS IN THE BODY TAKE TIME TO BUILD UP BUT ONE THEY'VE BUILT UP THEY A THE CLEARLY CAN BENEFIT US AND THEN OTHER THINGS AS YOU MENTION YOU KNOW A STIMULANT FOR INSTANCE HAS A VERY ACUTE AF FACT THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR WITH UNOPIQUE WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES AND WEAR OFF WITHIN YOU KNOW FOUR HOURS OR SO CAN ALSO HAVE SOME CHRONIC EFFACTS BUT TYPICALLY IT'S A SHORT LIVED EFFACT SO WE SWONG TO FRAME UP THE THE LANGUAGE THAT WILL BE USING AND I'M REALLY ECIDE TO DIVE INTO THIS TOPING THIT THIN CRETIAN AS A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF A SUPPLEMENT THAT HAS POSITIVE CHRONIC MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS DOWN THE ROAD I CAN COME BACK AND TALK A LITLBOUT MORE ABOUT CRETIAN WE CAN COVER SOME OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING BEST PRACTICES FOR GETTING THE MOST OUT OF IT AS WELL AS WILL CERTAINLY DIVE INTO SOME OF THE COMMON SCINE OF FACTS OR AT LEAST A THOUGHT OF SIDE EFFECTS WHILE WERE HERE THOUGH I ALSO COULD THROW IN A FEW OTHER OF THESE HIGH IMPACT LOW COST GENERALLY SAFE THINGSTHAT ARE MY EIGHTY TWENTY RULE IF YOU WILL SO THE WAY I ACT UYE CIN OF THINK ABOUT IT IS YOU WANT ONE FROM EACH OF THREE CATEGORIES AND THESE CATEGORIES ARE FUEL STIMULANT AND FATIGUE BLOCKERS SO CRATINE IS ACTUALLY IN THE FUEL IT'S NOT A STIMULANT WE TALK ABOUT THE CHRONIC EFFECT THAT SO WE ALREADY KNOCK THAT N ANOTHER ONE FROM THE A FATIGUE BLOCKER IS GOING TO BE ANYTHING LIKE BAY TO ALLENINE OR SOTING BY CARBONAT AND THEN FROM THESE STIMULA USE OF COURSE WE HAVE ANYTHING LIKE A BETRU JUSE TO A CAFINE OR A SOMETHING OF THE EQUIVALENT SO WE CAN COME BACK AGAIN AND TALK ABOUT ALL THOSE MORE DETAIL A LITTLET LATER BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE TAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS ALSO SEPARATE FOR DOCTOR ANDY GALLOPIN'S TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT CAL STATE FULLERTON IT IS HOWEVER PART OF OUR DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE FORLY TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME WED LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS MORMENTUS MOMENTOUS MAKE SUPPLEMENTS OF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY THE HUBORMAN LAB PODCAST IS PROUD TO BE PARTNERING WITH FORMENTUS FOR SEVERAL IMPORTANT REASONS FIRST OF ALL AS I MENTION THEIRE SUPPLEMENTS ARE OF EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY SECOND OF ALL THEIR SUPPLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY IN SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCALL YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS MAINLY ON USING SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS WIT SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS YOU CAN DEVISE THE MOST LOGICAL AND EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMENT FOR YOUR GOALS IN ADDITION MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENT SHIP INTERNATIONALLY AND THIS IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT MANY OF THE HUBERMAN LADPODCAST LISTENERS RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS MENTIONED ON THE HUBERMANLAD PODCAST IN PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENTS FOR FORMON HEALTH FOR SLEEP UPPLEMIZATION FOR FOCUS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER TH NGS INCLUDING EXERCISE RECOVERY YOU CAN GO TO LIVEMOMENTOUS SPELLED O U S SO THATS LIVMOMENTOUS DOKCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY LEVELS LEVELS IS A PROGRAM THAT LETS YOU SEE HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND ACTIVITIES AFFECT YOUR HEALTH BY GIVING YOU REAL TIME FEED BACK ON YOUR BLOOD GLUCOS YUSING A CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONITOR MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT THEIR BLOOD SUGAR THAT IS THEIR BLOOD LUCOS LEVEL IS CRITICAL FOR EVERYTHING FROM FAT LOSS TO MUSCLE GAIN TO HEALTHY COGNITION AND INDEED AGING OF THE BRAIN AND BODY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOWEVER HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND FOR AN ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXERCISE OR DIFFERENT TEMPERATURED ENVIRONMENTS IMPACK THEIR BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS AND YET BLOODLUCOS IS EXQUISITELY SENSITIVE TO ALL OF THOSE THINGS I FIRSTARTED USING LEVELS ABOUT A YEAR AGO AS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT FOODS EXERCISE AND TIMING OF FOOD RELATIVE TO EXERCISE AND QUALITY OF SLEEP AT NIGHT IMPACK MY BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS AND I'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FROM USING LEVELS IT'S TAUGHT ME WHEN BEST TO EAT WHAT BEST TO EAT WHEN BEST TO EXERCISE HOW BEST TO EXERCISE AND HOW TO MODULATE MY ENTIRE SCADUAL FROM WORK TO EXERCISE AND EVEN MY SLEEP SIF YOUR INTEREST IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT LEVELS AND TRYING IT CONTINUES GLUCOS MONER YOURSELF GO TO LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMEN THAT'S LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMENTO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT CONTAINS THE EXACT RATIOS OF THE ELECTROLITE SODIUM MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM TO OPTIMY CELLER FUNCTIONING FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MOST PEOPLE REALIZE THAT HYDRATION IS KEY WE NEED TO INJEST AN OF FLUIDS IN ORDER TO FEEL OUR BEST IN PERFORMOR BEST BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE IS THAT THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR CELLS AND NERVE CELLS NUROMS IN PARTICULAR REQUIRES THAT SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BE PRESENT IN THE CORRECT RATIOS NOW OF COURSE PEOPLE WITH PREHY PRETENSION AND HY PRTENSION NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THEIR SODIUMEN TAKE BUT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT IF YOU DRINK CAFFINE IF YOU EXERCISE AND IN PARTICULAR IF YOUR FALLING O VERY CLEAN DIET THAT IS NOT A LOT OF PROCESS FOODS WHICH OF COURSE IS A GOOD THING CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM TO OPTIMIZE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACKED RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIM AND NO SUGAR IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELM NT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE SAMPLE PACK TO START OFF I WANT O ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT AS SOON AS I SAY IT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ROLL THEIR EYES OR WONDER WHY R EVEN TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW BUT THAT I HAVE TO BELIEVE IS AMONG THEM ORE FUNDAMENTAL IF NOT FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF NUTRITIONMAN SUPPLEMENTATION PER PERFORMANCE AND THAT'S HYDRATION RIGHT I MEAN I THINK WE HEAR HYDRATIONS I GO KE WE HAVE TO DRANK SIX DAY GLASSS A WATER EVERY DAY ARE YOURIN SHOULD BE RELATIVELY CLEAR IF IT'S TOO DARK YELLOW OR NOT DOING A JOB OF HYDRATING ENOUGH HOW MUCH OF THAT IS TRUE UM IS ALKALINE WATER WORTH WHILE FOR CHANGING THE ALKALINITY OF MY BODY I LEARNED WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT THE ALKALINITY OF THE DIFFERENT TISSUES IN YOUR BODY IS VERY WELL CONTROLLED IN ORDER TO KEEP YOU ALIVE AND THAT YOU DON'T WANTID TO SHIFT TOO MUCH OR YOU CAN ENTER PRETTY HORRIBLE STATES OF SEIZURE VOMITING AND EVEN DEATH SO TELL ME ABOUT HYDRATION AND WOVEN INTO THAT IF YOU WOULD EDUCATE ME ON ELECTROLYTES AND HYDRATION BECAUSE I THINK MOST OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE IN JEST ELECTROLITES SURE THEY COULD BE IN JESTING SALT TABLETS PROBABLY GAING SOME ELECTROLYTS BY THE WAY ELECTROLIHT SHOTING MANESIAN POTASSIUM THROUGH THEIR FOOD I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT DRINKING ELECTROLITES WATER AND ELECTROLITES I THINK IT'S A VITALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC TO KICK THIS OFF WITH SURE WE CAN JUMP RIGHT END YOUR ALKALINE WATER WHILE THERE IS PERHAPS MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS WE CAN MAYBE RE VISIT THIS IN ANOTHER SEVEN PART SERIES ALON ITS OWN I WOULD JUST SAY IT THIS WAY THERE'S PROBABLY A FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD DO BEFORE WORRING ABOUT THE ALCLANITY OF YOUR WATER ANI'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT MEANING THE ALKALINY THE WATER IS IS SORT OF IURELEMENT NOT THAT YOU WON'T WON'T GO THAT FAR AS JUST IT'S PROBABLY MEMERALY STORE O STARTED OFF TALKING ABOUT EIGHTY TWENTY WELE THIS WOULD BE IN MY LIKE NINETY NINE ONE IN TERMS OF LIKE IF WERE REALLY AT THE LEVEL OF WORRING ABOUT THE P H OF THER YOUR DRINKING FLUID OR WE HAVE OPTIMIZED SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT BUT UNTIL WE HAVE NAILED MONTHS AND YEARS OF WORK ON OTHER THINGS THIS IS IS NOT GOING TO MAKE MUCH OF AN IMPACT GREAT THEN PERHAPS YOU COULD TELL US ABOUT WHAT VOLUME OF WATER WE SHOULD BE DRINKING WHEN WE SHOULD BE DRINKING THAT WATER RELATIVE TO TRAINING AND JUST GENERALLY AND UM AN ANYTHING ELSE RELATE TO WATER IN ELECTROLYTES THAT CAN IMPROVE MENTAL PERFORMANCE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND OFFSET ANY IUNOW ILL EFFECTS I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU MENTIONED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR IN BOTH CASES WE HEAR THAT WEED TO DRINK MORE WATER AND I CAN GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS AND A WILL IN A SECOND WE ALL SEEN TOU RECOGNIZES THERE'S THIS IS HORMESIS WE TALKED ABOUT HORMESIS AY A FEW EPISODES AGO AND THIS IS THE CASE RIGHT WHETHER WE TALKED ABOUT FOOD OR HYDRATION OR I THINK I GAVE THE EXAMPLE SYNIED NATURALLY OCCURRYING YOUR FOOD HOT WATER IS THE SAME WAY SO IF YOU ARE UNDER HYDRATED OR DEHYDRATED THEN THERE IS A CLEAR NEGATIVE EFFECT ON YOUR BODY AND AS I INCREASE THE LEVEL OR IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF HYDRATION THINGS GET BETTER WHETHER THIS ARE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE WHETHER IS MENTAL PEFORMANCE IN FACT WE KNOW THAT A BODYWEIGHT REDUCTION OF AS LOW AS TO PER CENT THE ADEHYDRATION SO IMAGINE YOU'RE DOING ABOUT OF EXERCISE AND YOUR SWEATING AND YOU LOSE TWO PER CENT OF YOUR BODYWAY THOT ALONE IS ENOUGH TO REDUCE ACCURACY IN PERFORMANCE SO THE CLASSIC STUDY WE TALK ABOUT HERE WAS IN BASBAL PLAYERS SO SHOOTING ACCURACY SO FREE THROUGH SHOOTING I THING A SPECIFIC I THEY LOOKD AT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PERFORMANCE WITH AS LITTLE AS TWO PER CENT THE YDRATION THAT THAT LEVEL YOU ALSO SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PERCEPTION OF DIFFICULTY OF EXERCISE AND SO ONLY RIGHT OT TWO PER CENT MA GOAN I SAE TWO PER CENT I MEAN PER CENT BODYWAY LOST THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS YOU STRIKE GITTING TOE THREE FOUR FIVE PER CENT THE IDRATION YOU START HAVING A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BLOOD VOLUM AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANTANT FOR ENDURANCE  YOUR BLOOD BECOMES VISCUS IF IT'S HARD TO PUM THROUGH AND YOU'RE GING TO START HAVING ALL KINDS OF ISSUES SO BEING DEHYDRATED IS AGAIN NOT ONLY GOING TO REDUCE PERFORMANCE BUT BECAUSE OF THE MENTAL ASPECT WHICH WE JUST WALK THROUGH AND NERAL MUSCULAR ISSUE YOUR GIN TO LOSE ACCURACY YOUR LOSE TOTAL UNDERIS PERFORMANCE AND YOU  LOSE SPEDEN POWER SO WE HAVE THE TRYOUT THERE NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ITS GOING TO BE HARMED BY BEING DEHYDRATED THAT ALSO IS HAPPENING THEN IF YOURE STARTING YOUR PROGRAM THE HYDRATED SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY ONE PER CENT OR SODE HYDRATE IT MAY BE LIKE A LITTLE UNDER HYDRATE IN THE LOSE LITTLE BIT OF SWEAT YOU'VE ALREADY HIT THAT TWO PER CENT AND SO ERE STARTING TO SEE REDUCTIONS A IN PERFORMANCE THERE THE SAME HAPPENS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT HORMATIC CURVE SO IF YOU ARE OPTABLY HYDRATED IN SOME LARGE WINDOW BUT YOU START GOING PASS THAT WE CAN START RUNNING INTO EQUAL PROBLEMS REMEMBER THEREIS A THERE IS A NEED FOR AN OPTIMAL CONCENTRATION OF SODIUM AN POTASSIM IN CHLORIDE BETWEEN YOUR CELL INSIDE YOUR CELL AND OUTSIDE YOUR CELL I THESE ARE ELECTRO LIKE TIS IS WHAT WE CALL OSMOLALITY AND OSMOLARITY IS IS REALLY RONE TO THINK OF IT LIKE CONCENTRATION AND OSMOSES IF YOU ARE OVER THOSE TERMS SO IF WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A MUSTE CONTRACTION THAT REQUIRES AN ELECTRICAL GRADIENT AND SO SODIUMN POTASSIUM SPECIFICALLY IN MAMUSIUM CALCIUM ARE POSITIVELY CHARGE AND CHLORIDE IS NEGATIVELY CHARGE AND WE NEED TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT INSIDE THE CELL AND OUTSIDE THE CELL SO THAT THE POSITIVES IN THE NEGATIVES ARE BALANCED APPROPRIATELY SO THAT WHEN WE MOVE ONE WE CHANGE THE VOLTAGEON WE HAVE IN THE CASE OF A MUSCLE CONTRACTION GAD TO SKIM THROUGH A WHOLE LOT OF  PHYSIOLOGY THERE TO SAY IF YOU THEN GO MESS WITH FLUID ONLY AND YOU SAY IF I RE TO GIVE YOU BOLLIS OF YOUR THREE LEADERS OF PURE WATER RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DILUTE YOUR BLOOD AND SO THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE AS MANY CHEMICAL THERE WON'T BE AS MANY E LECTRICAL SIGNALS AND THERE COUD YOU'VE TAKEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF SODIUM POTASSIUM T CETERA AND PUT IT IN A LARGER VOLUME OF PURE WATER SO THAT GRADIANT IS NOW CHANGED THAT BECOMES A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR CONTRACTION I MAN QUITE LITERALLY IT CAN KILL YOU THIS IS WHAT WE CALL HYPON ATREMIA  SO NOTREMIA M SPELLED N A HYPO BEING LOW I'M HYPOINT O TREMIA IF YOU ACTUALLY GO TO THE PERIODIC CHART N A IS WHAT WE I USE FIRST SODIUM SO HYPONI CAUSE THE WORD IST NATREMY ACTUALLY SO THAT WHAT THAT LITEALLY MEANS IS LOW SODIUM AND YOU DIDN'T GET THAT FROM SWEATING OUT ON YOUR SODIUM YOU ACTUALLY GET HYPONATREMA FROM DRINKING IN TOO MUCH WATER SO IT'S NOT THAT THE TOTAL AMUNT OF SODIUM GETS LOW IT'S THE FACT THAT THE CONCENTRATION GETS LOW FROM EXCESSIVE FLUID INTECT SO IN THE EXTREMES IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE LITERATURE YOU'LL SEE ANYWHERE BETWEEN LIKE TWO TO FIFTEEN PER IN OF PEOPLE WHO FINISH EN DURANCE RACES ARE ARE INDO HIPONTRAMIAN THAT THAT VARIES WILDLY IF YOU'RE DOING IRON MAN AND CONAVER SIS LIKE YOU KNOW THE MARITHON IN DENBER AND IN OCTOBER IT'S 'S GONG TO BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT APENNING ON WHAT HE CONDITIONS BUT THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT I'M SO WILL LIKE DEATH HAPPENS THAT IS SORT OF EXTREME IF YOU BACK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT YOU START SEEING THE SAME TYPES OF PERFORMANG SACRAMENTS OBUCT THE SYMPTOMS CAN BE IDENTICAL BRAIN FOG CONFUSION PERFORMANCE A IRRITATION A GI DISTRESS AND YOU THINK MAN THESE ARE SYMPTOMS OF DEHYDRATIONS THAN YOU DRINK MORE WATER ANDYOURE JUST EXASCERBATING THE PROBLEM AND I CAN ACTUALLY I GIVE YOU ONE  LITTLE EXAMPLE OF THIS WE HAD AAN EXECUTIVE ACTUALLY FEMALE SEE OH I'LL SAY SHE'S PROBLY WHEN HER WAS IN HER EARLY FORTIES AND SO SHE CAME TO US AND SHE THOUGHT MAN FOR SURE SHE HAS SOME SORT OF GOT PROBLEM GOING ON CAUSE WE HEAR LOT ABOUT KIND LIKE GOT HEALTH AND HOW IT EFFECTS EVERYTHING IND SO SHE SUS LIKE I HAVE BRAIN FOG AND I'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS HAN I GOT BLOOD WORKED ON AND EVERYTHING'S FINE LIKE THATHI'S GOING ON I THINK I MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF GOD THING ARE GOING ON WHATEVER IS OK AND WE JUS TAURT GOING THROUGH HER STUFF AND A SHE WAS I THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS A PLUSERMINUS AND SHE WAS CONSUMING LIKE TWO UNDRED FIFTY TO SIXTY OUNCES OF WATER A DAY THAT'S A TONAL WATER AND WE WERE LIKE COLY SHET WHATARE YOU DOING THIS FOR N SHE SAYS LIKE I THI SORT LIKE MY THINGS BUT SHE DIDN'T REALIZE S MORE LIKE A NERVOUS TICK THAN WAS ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT SHE JUST LIKE SIPSIBSIBSIPSIP WATER AND MY MAN HOW OFTEN YOU GO PEN SHE'S LIKE YE AT LIKE EVERY NO THIRTY MENUTES FOR SOMETHING AND MY FANTASTIC SLEEP PROBLEMS FOCUS AND SO SHE SMASHING CAFFEE AND SHE WAS AT LIKE EIGHTCUPS OF COFFEE TO DAY WHICH IS AL SO GOOD ATUS TO EXCRETION OR SO DO OU AT TOTALLY RIGHT SO IT'S LIKE OK WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO COME IN AND RUN A SLEEP STUDY ON YOU WORDS CAN TO LOWER YOUR WATER AND SHE WAS LIKE WHAT  WE DROPPED HER DOWN TO LIKE ONE EIGHTY SO BASICALLY AAN OUNCE PUR POUND OF BODYWIGHT WHICH IS TILL I CAUSE SHE DID TRAIN HUNDER AN EIGHTY AUNCES CORRECT YONO SHE DOES WORK OUT SO SHE NEED YOU REPLANISH SEMSELF N WILL COVER THESE NUMBERS IN A SECOND INSTANTANIOS AMI LIKE TWO DAYS AN SHE'S LIKE O MY GONA I HAVEN'T SLEPT SIX STRAIGHT HOURS AND YEARS AND THEN AFTER THAT IT WAS LIKE BASELY TEARS COMING BACK TO US RIGHT MY FOCUS MY BRAIN FOG IS GONE SHE'SN'T A VERY HIGH PRESSURE JOB A LIKE EVERYING'S COMING BACK LIKE NOW SHE WAS DOWN TO THREE OR SO CUPS I OFF YO DAY BUT A LIKE THE WHOLE THING DIGESTION IMPROVED ALL OF IT SHE WAS IT LIKE HER ONLY PROBLEM AFTER ALL THE ANALYSIES WAS SHE WAS JUST DRINKING WAY WAY TOO MUCH WATER AND ADDING MORE SALT TO HER WOULD NOT AF SOLVED THE PROBLEM CAUSE SHE WOULD AD JUST HAD SIMPLY WAY TOO MUCH FLUIDEN ER SYSTEM SHE WAS HAVING ALL KINDS O EIGHTY EIGHT PROBLEMS AND A DOSTERON LIKE THE WHOLE THING IN THAT THAT ROLLS IN A CORTUS ALL THE WHOLE LIKE SYSTEM GETS GOES INTO CHAOS SO IM IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PAY ATENTION IDRATION I'M EVEN KNOW AS YOU SORT OF MENTION PEOPLE TENDEDIS KIND LIKE RULE THEIR EYES AROUND IT BECAUSE IF YE WERE IN THE MIDDLE IT'S FINE BUT IF YOU'RE ANYWHERE PAST NOT EVEN THE EXTREME EXTREMES BUT JUST THAT FIRST STAND ER DEVIATION AWAY IM YOU CAN HAVE PROBLEMS AND YOU MIGHT BE THINKING I DRAIN OL FATIGUE YOU MIGHT BE THINKING YOU'RE JUST OUT LIK YOU ARE TO THINK ALL THESE THINGS AND YOU SIMPLY JUST HAVE AN ACTUALLY DIL THAN YOUR HYDRATION YO A I THINK PEOPLE SOMETIMES ROLL THEIR EYES AT THE DISCUSSION OF HYDRATION BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T SOUND VERY SEXY IT'S NOT LIKE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE U DERO TRANSMITTER OR HORNMONE IT AS SOUND LIKE JUST OSTERON OR ESTERED IN ARDIATIER OR UM DOPEN MEN BUT IT ACTUALLY IS ALL OF THOSE THINGS IT SITS AT A LEVEL BENEATH ALL OF THOSE BUT NOT BENEATH ON A HIERAKY BENEATH IN IN TERMS OF A FOUNDATION IT'S AUALLY THE WITHOUT PROPER ELECTOROLIKHT BALANCE AND HYDRATION NONE OF THE CELLS OF THE BODY CAN FUNCTION AND THEN I THINK PEOPLE ALSO HERE THAT OH YOU KNOW WE ARE SEVENTY PER CENT WATER AND SOMEHOW LIKE IT THAT STATISTIC ALONE AM OR THAT FACT ALONE DOESN'T SEEM TO A STIMULATE ANY KIND OF ACTION WILL TAKE AWAY LI GREAT YOU KNOW I LIKE GRAVITY ALSO YOU KNOW KEEPS US YOU KNOW ITFOM JUMPING IS EYE AS WE LIKE YOU KNOW IT WHAT DO I DO AND SO I THINK UM IT'S IT'S IMPORTING THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY CELLER PROCESS IN THE BODY CRITICALLY RELIES ON HAVING ENOUGH SODIA MAGNES IN PATASIUM AROUND AND THE THE WAY THAT IT'S CONCENTRATED IN FLUID WATER IS REALLY THE WAY THAT YOU ALLOW EVERY CELL IN TYOUR BODY TO FUNCTION AS WELL AS IT POSSIBLY COULD AND RESPOND TO ALL O THE SORTS OF CANQUITIC HIGH PERFORMANCE TOOLS YON THEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHE THING I'VE OBSERVED A MANY TIMES OVER IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE IN JESTING TOO MUCH WATER AND ALSO DRINKING A LOT OF CAFINE AND THEIRELECTROLIGHTS AR LOW THEY GET SHAKY AND THEY ACTUALLY CAN HAVE ANXIETY LIKE SYMPTOMS SHOU WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO MY LAB TO TO STUDIES ON ANXIETY IN FEAR WE ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND AM THOSE CRUSHES INCLUDE HOW MUCH WATER THEY'VE HAD THAT DAY ALSO A SORT OF BAZAARE FACT UM BUT ONE THAT I THINK IS WORTH MENTION IS THAT WHEN THE BLATTER IS FULL IT STIMULATES A SORT OF ANXIETY IF YOU EVER HAD TO YOU'RE ENATE VERY BADLY AND YOU'RE IN THE CAR ORE YOU CAN'T YOUR NAME THAN YOU GET TO THE DOOR LIKE THAT'S H TALK ABOUT IT ANGRIETY AM AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A DIRECT NERL PATHWAY FROM THE BLATTER THAT REGISTERS THE MECHANIC CENSORS HOW MUCH STRETCH THERE IS ON THE BLATTER THAT SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN STEM ALERTNESS ARIAS BROADLY SPEAKING LOCUSSERULIAS AN OTHERS UM THAT WAKE US UP THESE ARE THE WHEN WE'RE AWAKE IT MAKES US MORE AWAKE AND WHEN WE'RE SLEEP THIS IS WHAT WAKES US UP TO YOURINATE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT YET IS ACTUALLY WHY YOU CAN USE A U NIGHT YOUR NATION HAS A A PRETTY GOOD DIGNOSTIC OF SLEEP DISORDERS SO IF OU CAS A VAZEL PRESSENT RIGHT ALMOST EXACTLY WHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IF YOU'RE HAVING SLEEP ISORT ISSUES AN YOUR STAYING AWAKE AND AA VASOR PRESENT GETS TAKEN OFF RINAPIAN GOES STRAIGHT TO THE GIDNEAS YOU'R KINNEYS ARE SUPPOSED WE DORMENT ASICALLY AT NIGHT IUN OST MOST BE FILTERING LOTIC IN PRODUCING A LOT OF YOUR IN AT NIGHT IM IF THAT'S HAPPENING AND AN SAY YOU YOU HAVE ANY NUMBER OF APNES KICKING ONOR AN IN GOING ON I VEY SURPRESS AND EEPS GOING KEEP SANNIYG SIGNAL KINNY STRITFUL TERING SIF YOU'RE WAKING UP AND PEEING MULTIBLE TIMES A NIGH TIT'SCALLED NOCTOREA I THAT IS A VERY VERY GOOD SIGN THAT YOU ARE ONE OR TWO THINGS HAPPEN YOU ONE YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF SLEEP DISORTER OR TWO YOU'RE DRINKING OUT RAGEOUS AMOUNTS OF WATER AND SO THAT'S ACTUALLY  BIT OF BACKWARD CYCLE THAT RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE DRINKING WAY TOO MUCH WATER YOU WAKING UP AND BEING ALL NIGHT THAT'S ACTUALLY RUINIG YOUR SLEEP AND S WE HAVE SEEN THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES WITH OUR SLEEP COMPANY AS WE GO IN AN IT IS LIKE YOU DON'T NEED ANY THIS CRAP YOU JUST NEED TO BE PROPERLY HYDRATED ALTERNATIVELY IF YOUR HYDRATION IS SOUND AND YOU'RE STILL WAKING UP MORE THAN ONE TIME AN NIGHT TO P ON AVERAGE THEN YOU ALMOST I SHOULDN'T SAY LIKE THAT BUT THERE'S A POTENTIAL THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOME SORT OF I SLEEP TOSORTER SLEEP CONDITION GOING IN SO THE RULE THUMB ON THT THIS OER HERE ONCE OR NIGHT ONCE A NIGHT OR SO OF YOUR NATION IS FINE I'M IF IT IS ROUTINELY OR CONSISTENTLY MORE THAN TWO THAT YOUNIN TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENT START WITH HYDRATION IT'S THE SIMPLEST WAY RIGHT GETTING A FULL SLEEP STUDYIED DON'T JUST FIGURE OUT HYDRATION WE WHO WE'VE HAD THIS TAPPEN A NUMBER OF TIMES WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO GET MORE HEALTH CONSCIOUS AN THET JUS GET BUT HEAR THINGS LIKE THIS NI LIKE I GOT TO GET ON MY WATER AND THEN THEY TO START TRAIN RECKING THER SLEEP THE WAKING IT UP SO IF YOU'RE WAKING UP MOLTIPLE TIMES AND YOU'RE YEARNATING AND IT IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF YEARN FOR YOU AND IT IS CLEAR THAT'S PROBABLY NOT SLEEP APNY IN DUCE NOCTREA THAT'S PROBABLY EXCESS OFE HYDRATION IF YOU'RE WAKING UP UPONCEH OF TIMES AND IT'S FAIRLY SMALL AMOUNCE O YEAR AN THEN IT'S PROBABLY NOT I THE FLUIT ISSUE IT'S PROBABLY THE FACT THAT THE THESUPPRESSIN IS KICKING YOUR KINNEES INTO GEAR SO THAT'S NOT A PERFECT CRYTERIA BUT IT IS JUST LIKE A QUICK LITTLE TOOL YOU CAN SORT USE I'M THAT'S ACTUALY WNT O H REASONS WHY WE MEASURE ALMOST ALWAYS A YOUR BODY WEIGHT AT NIGHT AS WELL AS IN THE MORNING SO THAT THAT'S A LIKE THE COMBAT SPORT AND THE YOU HAVE SEE FIDERS BOXORS WE CALL THAT YOUR FLOAT SO MUH YOU FLOATED OVER NIGHT I LIKE TO KNOW THAT NUMBER CAUSE I WANT TO KNOW AS WELL YOU'RE FIRST MORNING BOIT SO WHENYOU WAKE UP YOU WENT TO BET AT TWO UNDRED POUNDS YOU WOKE UP THE NEXT MORE AND AT ONE NINETY FIVE OH WE FLOATED FIVE POUNDS DID YOU PEE LAST NIGHT YEA YET THREE TIMES INTERESTING ANOTHER CASE YOU WOKE UP YOU WENT TO BED A TWUINOR POUNDS YOU WAKE UP ONE NINETY NINE POINT FIVE OK ET YOU'R DEHYDRATED A YOU SHOULD HAVE A VI A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FLUE THAT YU'RE JUST  RESPIRING OUT AS YOU'R BREATHING THROUGOUT YOUR NOSE THROUGHOUT NIGHT IDEALLY I GUARANTEED YOU N'T WAKE UP WHAT WAS YOU'R YEARN LIKE OH YE LITTLE BIT PRETTY DARK LIKE SHOCKER YOUR DE HYDRATED SO YOU CAN CON A LOOK AT NUMBERS LIKE THAT A GENERAL FLOAT IS SOMETHING LIKE A POUND TO TWO POUNDS FOR THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PLUS POUND PERSON AS YOU SCALE UP THAT NUMBER CAND GO UP A LITTLE BIT YOU CAN KIND USE ESE TO TREOGE YOUR LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON I'M WITH THIS KIND OF COMBINATIONIS EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING RIGHT SO SYCHIT'S NOT JUST T ONE SOTEM SO YOU CAN A PA ATTENTION YOU CAN ALSO LOOK WELL I DON'T WE'VE YOU ON'T JUMP INTILL WE CAN BUT THERE'S A WHOLE MONCH O WAVES I I CAN TEACH YOU TO DIGNOS HYDRATION ATH MAYBE WE CAN START THERE IN THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT HYDRATION NUMBERS YES I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT DIGNOSTICS FOR HYDRATION OVERHYDRATION DE HYDRATION TO START OFF WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GIVE US SOME NUMBERS HOW MUCH WATER SOURE WE BE DRINKING THE CLASSIC RULE HERE AND YOU'RE MAKING ME DO WHAT I HATE AND I WAN'T GIVE ALL THE CAVIATS FORST WILL GO STRAIGHT YOUR NUMBER HALF AN OUNCE PROPOUND A BODY WEIGHT IS A ROUGH RULE SO A YOU WAI AGAIN TWO HNDRED POUNDS THAT WOULD MEAN YOU DRINK A HUNDRED OUNCES OF WATER A DAY MOST WATER BOTTLES ARE LIKE TWELVE TO TWENTY OUNCES SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU KNOW YOUR N O DRINKING SIXTHOSE ARE SO A DAY KIND LIKE PLUSRMINUS WHICH IS NOT THAT UNREASONABLE THIS DOES DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS OF WHICH I COUN GO OVER BUT THAT IS A A ROUGH STARTING PLACE THE ONLY OTHER THING TO ADD TO THAT IS THAT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR EXERCISE INDUCED WATER LOST ORSE ONA OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT'S ASSUMING JUST LIKE BAS OLD DAILY NEEDS IF YOU ARE A EXERCISEING OR SWEATING AT ALL FOR ANY REASONS OER WORK RELATED SO I FOLKS AT WORK OUTSIDE OR IN THE HEATER A HUMAN ENVIRONMENT THIS THESE NUMBERS ALL CHANGE AND YOU CAN SLIDE THE SCALE UP BUT YOU GENERALLY WANT A DRINK ABOUT A HUNDRED AN TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE FLUIDS YOU'VE LOST DURING THAT PHYSIC ACTIVITY BACK AND HOW MUCH YOU LOSE PUR HOUR OF EXERCISE IT THAT NUMBER RANGE IS BETWEEN ONE A FIVE POUNDS DEPENDING ON THE PERSE AND NICKIN EVEN BE HIGHE WITH SOME OF OUR I AT THES O LIKE I CAN THINK OF A NUMBER OF AND I FELL PLAYERS RIGHT NOW IT'S NT IN COMMON FOR THOSE GUISESLY TO EIGHT OR NINE POUNDS EVEN NOT EVEN LIKE CRAZE CIRCUMCANCES IF IT'S AUGUST AND WORE IN JACKSON VILLE IT'S NOT WILD FOR US THOSE GUISES T GO NINE TEN POUNDS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TYPICAL PERSON GOES TO A AIR CONDITION JIM OR GOES OUT FOR A RUN ON A DAY THAT IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN LET'S AY FIFTY FIVE DEGREES FAIR IN HEIGHT AND EIGHTY FIVE DEGREES FOR YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING OUT LIKE AHT POUND IT'S NOT EXTREMELY HEIGHT IF YOU ARE TOTALLY SOAKED MIGHT BE LIKE A POUND AND A HALF THE TWO POUNDS IF YOU LIKE COME BACK AND LIKE YOUR PITS ARE LITTLE SWEATY ANDTHERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WATER COND ABON YOUR NECK LINAR ET IT'S PROBABLY LIKE A MORE LIKE A POUND OR SO SO IN THAT CASE YOU MIGHT DRINK BACK A POUND AND A HALF WATER O CASE I'R JUST TO REVIEW THESE NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M ON THE CORRECT PAGE HERE A HALF AN OUNCE OF FLUID PERPOUND O BODY WEIGHT IS A A SORT OF A FOUNDATION FOR HIDRATION AND THEN YOU WANT TO REPLACE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE FLUID LOST DURING EXERCISE AND EXERCISE VERYS WHERE EXERCISE IS DONE VARIES WHETHER NOT PEOPLE WEARING UNIFORMS OR HELMETS IS GONIN PACK HOW MUCH FLUED THEY LOSE ET CETERA IN A VERY HOT ENVIRONMENT THAT THE AMOUNT OF FLUID LOST CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW ONE TO FIVE MAYBE IN TEN POUNDS EASY PER HOUR OF HARD HARD EXERTION FOR MOST EXERCISE DONE IN CONDITIONS OF FIFTY FIVE DREES FIR HIGHT TO SEVEN TO EXCUSE ME EIGHTY FIVE DEREES FAIR IN HEIGHT DONE WITH SOME DEGREE OF EFFORT ONE MIGHT LOSE A POUND OR OR A TWO POUNDS OF WATER SUPEREASY WEGH TO FIND OUT ILL YOU HAVE TO DO AS WEIGH YOURSELF NAKED GO DO YOUR WORK OUT COME BACK IN DRY OFF WEY YOURSELF NAKED THAT'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY IT YOU LOSTS OIF YOU WENT IN YOU RE HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS YOU COME BACK OUT YOU WEIGHTYOU WANT FIFTY EIGHT YOU LOST TWO POUNDS DRINK BACK TWO AND A HALF POUNDS WATER OU GOOD SO THAT IS A IS AD ONESTYS LIKE FAIRLY GOLD STANDARD FOR IDENTIFYING YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUY A WHOLE BUNCH OF TACNOLOGY FOR TH US AND THEY ARE USING THE EXACT SAME A QUESTION WHICH IS YOUR BODY QUATE WHEN YOU WERE THERE NOW IF YOU DO THAT THOUGH YOU DO NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY FLUID YOU DRANK DURING THE WORK OUTER OS THAT THEN OFFSESIN THE SIMPLE BUT I THINK IMPORTANT QUESTION WERE TIE BOUT A HALF ANNOUNCE OF FLUID PROPOUNDER BODY WEIGHT DOES THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE COFFEE TEA SODA PREWORK OUT DRINKS MIDWORK OUT DRINKS AMATE MACHA WHATEVER THE ANOTHERS ERBOMATE THERE'S  THERE MILLING THINGS OUT THERE A OR JUST WATER ANY FLUID FOR THE MOST PART IS AN ACCOUNT AND IS IT TRUE THAT FLUIDS THAT CONTAIN KAFFINE GENERALLY CAUSEUS TO SECRETE SODIUM YET O KAS SO DO YOU RECOMMEND INCLUDING ELECTOR LIKE POWDER OR A SMALL PINCH OF SODIUM OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER SUPPLEMENT TYPE ELECTROLITES THAT CAN REPLACE THAT SODIUM MAGNESIMEN POTASSIUM A COUPLE THINGS WE OUGHT TO PAY ATTENTION TO TO ACCURATELY ANSWER THAT QUESTION WILL YOU ALSO SORT OF ASKD ABOUT YOU MAY A'VE NOT I REALIZE IS IS KAFFINE ACTUALLY IN HANCS THE HYDRATION IWHICH IS NOT REALY WIT YOU ASKE BUT IT'S PROBABLY LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IS WELL SO KAFFINE CAN BUT COFFEE DOESN'T NECESSARILY TOTHAT BECAUSE I REMEMBER YOUR COIN JUSTIN THAT WITH FLUID AND SO WILL A WE USED TO SAY THATALL THE TIME OU COFFEE YOU HYDRATES YO IT DOESN'T AW MIGHT MAKE YOUR YURIN YELLOW AND CERTAINLY GIVES OFFEN I ODOR YOUR YEARN BUT IN GENERAL COFFEE WILL NOT DO THAT COS YOUR JUSTICE IF YOU WERE TO NOW TO BE TAKING KAFFINE PILLS ALONE NOW THERE THERE IS A BIT OF A DIARATIC EFFECT THERE AND SO YOUE GON TO YEARN IT HOW MUCH MAY BE NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU BE REALLY CONCERND WITH E SPECIAL WHEN YOU BALANCE THAT AGAINST THE ERGOGENTICAL FACTS AND BENEFITS O KAFFINE IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SECOND BY YOUR QUESTION DO YOU NEED TO THEN OFFS AT THE LOSS O SODY I'M NOT SUPERCONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SODIUM LOST A KAFFINE I AM MORE CONCERNED ABOUT SIMPLY THE AMOUNT OF SODIUM BEING CORRECT BECAUSE OF THE BIGGER CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE HOW MUCH IS IC TUALY IN YOUR SYSTEM AND HOW MUCH YOU LOST IN THE TRAINING SESTIONS WAS NOT THE KAFFIN THAN I CARE ABOUT THAT MUCH RELATIVE TO AU IF YOU LOST THREE GRAMS A SODIUM BECAUSE OF THE TRAINING AND YOU ADDED ANOTHER FEW MILIGRAMS BECAUSE THE KAFINE I DON'TREALLY CARE OR OR DIDN'T I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SUBSTANCE LIKE KAFFINE AND THE VEHICLE IT'S CONTAINED IN MI COFFEE THIS IS LL REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT ALSO RAISES E QUESTION BY INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCEIS IN SWEATING ABILITY AND I CALL IT SWETING ABILITY BECAUSE I'VE A GOOD FRIEND I'VE KNOWN FOR AGES REALLY OM ASHI WORK WITH HIM IN MY LABORATORY AS WELL AND HE'S ONE O THESE PEOPLE THAT THE MOMENT HE STARTS ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IT'S LIKE A FLOOD WARNING AN ID JUST SOAKS THROUGH CLOTHINGS JUST THE SWEATING ADAPTATION IS IS EXCEEDINGLY ROBUST IN HIM OTHER PEOPLE LESS SO SO IS IT TRUE THAT WEATING IN OUR ABILITY TO DUMP HEAT THROUGH A BY LU LOSS OF WATER SOMETHING THAT AM WE TEND VERY ON IN THAT ALSO THAT WE CAN BUILD UP THAT CAPASI I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AP WRITING IL GR OWUS WHY WOULD I WANT TO SWEAT MORE UT THERE'S ACTUALLY A HUGE ADVANGE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DUMP BODY HEAT DURING EXERTION BECAUSE BODY HE IN SOME WAYS SETS THE CAP FOR PERFORMANCE AN LOT MANY MANY WAYS INCLUDING MENTA PERFORMENCE OR HARABILITY I STAY ALERT OFTEN IS ENHANCED BY BEING COLD AND COURSE WE ALL WANT TO WARM UP PROPERLY BUT AM IN TERMS OF LOSS OF FLUID THROUGH SWEATING IS THERE WAY TO EASILY BEN OURSELVES INTO KIND OF A A LOW SWEATER MEDIUM SWEATER A HEAVY SWEATER THIT'S TARTLY A AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING BUT IN ANY CASE YOU YOU KNOW IT  YOU KNO MAN ANOTHER A LOT TO SAY HERE WISHIN WHICH WE HAD A WHOLE SERIES ON THIS AS IN IF WE HAVE TO GO SEVENTEEN HOURS WE CAN DO IT JUST EVERYBODY HIG DRATE WELL I THINK WE'VE SHOWN THE LISTENERS A THAT IS A REAL THREAT THAT'S A VERY REAL THREAT PODCASTING TO FAILURE YOU DON'T DO EVERY SET IN THE GIM TO FAILURE BUT YERE WEARE ATEMPTING OPODCAST FILLER IN IT IN ALL SERIES OF THIS AM WHAT WHAT IS THE ROLE OF SWEATING ABILITY AND IS THE SOMETHING THAT ANY OF US SHOULD CARE ABOUT OR TRAIN FOR OR PAY ATTENTION TO ERS THIS IS KIND OF GETTING INTO THE ARCANE NEVER ON YOU CAN TRAIN YOU'RE ABILITY TO SWEAT THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR HEAT OCCLAMATION AND WHY THAT MATTERS WHEN YOU SWEAT THAT ACTUALLY IS NOT WHAT REGULATES YOUR TEMPERATURE  YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE HAPPINESS THE FLUID TO HIT YOUR SKIN AND THAT TO BE EVAPORATED THAT'S THE ACTUAL MECHANISM SO IN FACT I IF YOU STOP SWEATING THE YOU CAN GUARANTEE WITHIN A SHORT AMOUT OF TIME YOU'RE TO BE DONE MOVING A VERY INTERESTING I HOPE PEOPLE HEARD THAT AND REALLY AR AR HIGHLIGHTING THAT IN THEIR MIND THAT SWEATING IS A PROCESS OF BRING FLUID FROM YOUR BODY ON TO THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN AND THEN THE HEAT DUMPING ASPECT OF SWEATING IS THE EVAPORATION OF THAT FF OFF YOUR BODY WHICH BRINGS TO MIND ALL SORTS OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO DRESS DURING EXERCISE ET CETERA BUT WHAT YOU SAID IS THAT IF YOU ARE NOT SWETING ENOUGH YOU ARE LIMITING YOUR OUT PUT CAPACITY SOS NOT JUST ABOUT HAVING ENOUGH FLUID TO SWEAT YOU IT'S ALSO ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SWEAT AND BEING A ADRESSED APPROPRIATELEAST TO ALLOW THAT SWEAT TO MOVE UT TO EVAPORATE OFF YOUR BODY YET AND HE ACCLAMATION TRAINING IS AS SIMPLE AS A SOUNDS SO JUST PRACTICE AMORE SO A IF YOU'RE GOING INTO A PROCESS OR YOU EED ER NEED TO BE IN A HOT ENVIRONMENT BOR YOU NEED TO IMPROVE YOUR SWET RATE YEAT IS NEED TO PRACTICE SWEATING AND YOUR BODY WILL GET BETS THAT A PRACTICE O ONA PRACTICE SUCH ACUS JUST GET IN THOSE THINGS AND YOU WILL A IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO DO THAT NOW THERE IS A HUGE GENETIC COMPONENT A I HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL ACTUALLY A YOU SEE FIGHE REPIN WORK WITH I DO DON'T MIND MENTIONING HIS NAME HE'LL GIVE ME FULL PERMISSION COT HOLTSMEN AMANY MANY YEARS A HE'S ACTUALLY A FIGHTING RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY TO DAY HE'L BE GOING HE IS THE HEAT IS LIKE YOU DESCRIBED LIKE BUCKETS AND BUCKETS AND BUCKETS OF FLUIDS COME OFF THE SKY WHEN HE'S TYING ISSUES HE JUST GOES REI AND NOW IF WE'VE INPROVE THAT I ACTUE SWEAT TOO MUCH WE WORKE ON NOT A LOT EARLY IN HIS CAREER AND WE WE GOT SOME PROVEMENT DOUND GET HIM TO HOLD ON TO T TO FLUIDS BETTER THAT BEING SAID I'VE WORKED ATHE OTHER INDIVIDUA LS IN HIS WEIGHT CATEGORY AN IT'S THE OPPOSITE RIGHT SO WE CAN O HAVE THEM LITERALLY DO THE EXACTING TRANSCESSION TO GETHER AND SCOUT WILL DUMP SIX POUNDS AND AND OTHER FOLKS AT HIS SIZE WILL DUMP TO TO AN A HALE SO THERE'S A GENNIC UPON THAT IS IS THERE AND YOU DON'TNEED TO WORRY ABOUT THERE IMSO CAN YOU IDENTIFY IF YOU ARE A HEAVY SALT SWEATER OR NOT WILL YOUHVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF ROUTS FOR THIS NUMBER ONE AS YOU CAN USE THE OLD FREE  COST FREE TEST OF JUST LOOKING AT YOUR CLOTHING AND IF YOU'R SEEING THAT WHITE RESIDUE ALL OVER IT SO YOU YOU ALL HAVE THE FRIEND WHO PROBABLYWARS THAT SAME BAST BASEBALL HAT THAT THEY'VE HAD FOR EIGHT YEARS IF IT IS COVERED IN THE WHIHTE JUNK ALL OVER THE PLACE  THAT'S A SIGN OF A HIGHER SALT SWEATER IF THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS ANS LIKE YOU CAN PULL THEIR CLOTHING BACK AND THERE'S US NOTHING THERE I THERE MAY BE ELITIBIT OF A LOWER SALT SWEATER IM YOU CAN ALLSO USE ANY NUMBER OF A HIDRATION TESTS I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME COMING OUT THE MARKET VERY VERY SOON THAT CAN GIVE YOU THEORETICALLY REAL TIME IM MEASUREMENTS S LIKE A SE GUM WOULD BE ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY DATA ON IF THOSE ARE ACCURATOR NOT HAVE A USED ON YET  BUT THERE NUMBER THAT ARE OUT A SUPER CHEAP YOF TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY BLOXS HALL WY UP TO COUPLE OF UNDRED DOLLARS YOU CAN BUY THESE PATCHES PUT THEM ON YOUAN GET A REASONABLY CLOSE ESTIMATE AGAIN IF THOSE THINGS ARE FIVE OR TEN OR TWENTY PER CENT OFF I DON'T KNOW HAVE TO SEE INTO PENETATE TO COME OUT FIRST BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE YOU NOT YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC MILEGRAMS RIGHT WHETHER YOU SWEAT OUT AND TWELVE HUNDRD FIFTY MELEGRAMS ON WORK OUT OR IF IT'S THIRTEEN FORTY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK FOR BIG BIG NUMBERS RIGHT ARE YOU LOSING FIVE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS USEIN THREE AND HALF GRAMS WEE YO'RE AT SO THOSE THING WILL GET YOU IN THA BALL PARK TO DO EXACTLY Y TO SAY TO MY HIGH MEDIUM OR LOW IAND THERE'S A LOT OF THEM THAT THAT I'VE USED IN THE PAST SO THAT THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO GO ABOUT IT IM THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS PROBABLY MATCH YOURE ELECTROLITE IN TAKE TO SOMETHING CLOSE TO WHAT YU SWEAT THAT'S TE IDEAL SCENAREA IM YOUNGET A LOT IN FORMATION BY HIDRATION FROM BLOOD M YOU CAN LOOK IT LIKE ACUTE MARKERS OF DEIDRATION LIKE HEMO GLOBE AND HEMATIGRIT I  IF YOU'RE LIKE COUL YOU HAM A GLOBIN IS LIKE FIFTEEN PLUSS IT'S FUNNY  WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND IF YOU HAVE SOS BEFOR BUT I SEE THAT ON LIKE MAN THAT DO SUPERFIT THAT'S LIKE A FIFTEEN FOR HIM A GO  BE PETTY HIGH FOURTEEN OR SO WOULD BE PRETTY GOOD FOR A FEMALE THAT'S ALSO THE EXACTING THING IS THE SIGN OF ACUTE DE IDRATION SO CAMATICRATE SAME THING IF YO'RE NORTH O FIFTY PER CENT YOUR PROBAY HIDERD SO YOU CAN GET A LOT THERE ARE ALSO THO A LOT OF BILE MARKERS THAT CAN TELL YOU MORE ABOUT CHRONIC THE IDRATION S YOU CAN RUN THOUGH THOSE THINGS AS WELL SO GOOD BLOOD CHEMISTRY TESTS CAN TELL YOU A LOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET SOME INSIDE N YOU'RE SODEMEN PATASSIUM I'LL BEWMIN UTES ANOTHER FANTASTIC WAIGT ON TO MEASURE LONGER TERM I IDRATIONS THATIS NOW WHENE THE AMAZING GOLOBULANCE THAT WE SORT OF TALK LOT ABOUT SO YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS YOU CAN ALSO SIMPLY MEASURER THE BODY WEIGHT PREIMPOSED AND USE SWEAT PATCH OR NOT AND YOU SEE THAT FOR YOUR VERSION OF YOUR CLOTHING TEST AND GET A ROUGH IDEA OF WHERE YOU GETTING IT FROM SO THOSE ARE GOOD PLACES O START  I ONE TO GO BACK THOUGH IT MAKE TRAWAS OVER TERRIFYING THE AUDIENCE TOO MUCH ON A SOVAPIECE IF YOU'RE PERFORMING A TYPE OF TRAINING OR EXERCISE OR SPORT IN WHICH YOU'RE NOT LOSING MORE THAN TWO PER CENT OUR BODYWAY YOU DON'T NEED TO BE OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT HIGH DRADING IN THE SPORT AND SO WE CAN ACTUALY GET IN TE TO I'M SOME EQUATIONS FOR HOW MUCH WATER TO DRINK DURING TRAINING RIGHT NOW BUT I FO  FOR AGAIN LOSING LESS THAN THAT IS NOT CRITICAL YOU CAN HAVE SOME FLUIDS IF IKE MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER BUT YOUE NOT O BE EXPERIENCING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF PERFORM SACRAMENTS IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW AGAN OUT PLAYING AABASEBALL GAME AND IS FIFTY DEGREES OUT YOU'RE FIND I'M ME DRINK SOME WATER BUT THAT'S NOT GO TO BE COMPROMISING PERFORMANCE OR RECOVERY SO WE CAN ACTUALLY THEN IF YOU'D LIKE I CAN GO THROUGH THE THREESTEPS SYSTEM FOR OPTIMIZING HYDRATION BUT A THOSE ARE IT WANT TO MAKE TRIPLANM THAT FLAG SO PEOPLEARE IS TERRIFY THAT THEY GOT TO BE GUZZLING DOWN WATER IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW GOING TO THE PHYSICAL PHARAPISTS FOR SOME STRATCHING AS THAT'S PROBINGOT SUPERIMPORTANT I LIKE TO SEE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR ATHLETIC GREENS ITH LETIC GREENS IS A VITIM IN MINERAL PROBIOTIC AND ADAPTID IN DRINK DESIN TO HELP YOU MEET ALL F YOUR FOUNDATION OR NUTRICIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SO I'M DELIGHTED THAT THEIR RE SPONSOR OF THIS PODCAST REASON I STARTED TAKING ETHLETIC GREENS IN THE REASON I STILL TAKE OUTHLETIC GREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME MEET ALL MY FOUNDATION OR NUTRICIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT COVERS MY VITEMENS MY MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS ARE ASPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME ITH LETI GRENS ALSO CONTAINS A DAPTOGINS WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR RECOVERING FROM STRESS FROM EXERCISE FROM WORK OR JUST GENERAL LIFE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ITH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETI GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU YEAR SUPPLY O VIT IM IN DEE THREE CAY TO AGAIN IF YOU LIKE TO TRY IT LETIC GRENS GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US WHAT I REFERD TO AS THE GALLOPAN EQUATION UNDERSTANDING OF COURSE THAT YOU DID NOT NAME AT THE GALOPAN EQUATION LISTEN FOLKS SCIENTIST CAN HAVE THINGS NAMED AFTER THEM BUT IN GENERAL IT'S NOT A REFLECTIVE OF HEALTHY PSYCHOLOGY IF THEY NAME THINGS AFTER THEMSELVES CORRECT SOMETIMES YES NOR ANATAMISTS USE TO DO THAT BUT IN ANY CASE DOCTOR ANTO GALOPAN DID NOT NAME THE GALLOPAN EQUATION AFTER HIMSELF I NAMED IT AFTER HIM AND THE GALLOPAN EQUATION FOR HOW MUCH FLUID TO IN GEST DURING EXERCISE IS YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR BODY WEIGHT IN POUNDS AND DIVIDE THAT BY THIRTY AND YOU WANT TO CONSUME THAT NUMBER WHICH WOULD BE IN OUNCES ABOUT EVERY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES SO IN THE EXAMPLE AOF YOU BEING TWO HNDRED POUNDS YOU WOULD TAKE TWO HUNDRED DIVIDED BY THIRTY WHICH IS LITZES CALL THAT NUMBER SEVEN TO BE CLOTHES WHICH MEANS YOU'D CONSUME ABOUT SEVEN OUNCES OF WATER EVERY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES OR SO NOW AS LITTLE BIT OF A POINT WHILE I ALSO DID NOT NAME AND I ALSO DIDN'T DO THE RESEARCH IT'S IMPORTAN TO POINT OUT THAT OTHER SCIENTISTS FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT I JUST READ THEIR PAPERS AND MADE THAT DERRIVATION OF THEIR EQUATION TO MAKE IT LEVIT EASIER FORUST FOLKS WHO I DO NOT WORK ON THE METRIC SYSTEM K A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT TWO HUNDRED POUNDS BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH HIT WAY BECAUSE THE POINT IS IT THE LISTENER CORRECT SHOULD TAKE THEIR BODY WEIGHTIN POUNDS DIVIDED BY THIRTY AND JST THAT NUMBER OF OUNCES IN FLUID EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN FOR THOSE OUT THERE OUTSIDE THE YOUSS THAT ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THINKING IN MILL LEADERS AND LEADERS NOT OUNCEES AND KILEGRAMS NOT POUNDS WHAT IS THE GALOPIN EQUATION IN THE METRIC SYSTEM THIS WOULD BE TWO MILL LEADERS PROKILEGRAM WHICH AGAIN IF YOU WERE A LET'S SAY TWO HUNDRED POUNDS THAT'S GOINGTO BE SOMETHING ROUGHLY LIKE WILL CALL IT NINETY KEELOS AND SO IF YOU DID TWO MILLIARS PEKULO YOU'D BE SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILL LEADERS OF FLUID AGAIN EVERY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES GREAT AND HOW SHOULD PEOPLE IN JEST THAT FLUID AND OF COURSE I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S THROUGH THEIR MOUTH O IHO THERE ARE OTHER ORIFICES THAT AT IT MIGHT SFICE BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE THE'RE DRINKING THAT WATER CONSISTENTLY OR S IT EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES THEY SLUG IT BACK DOES IT MATTER OGEY YET THAT'S VERY GOOD A HANDFUL OF THINGS IN GENERAL YOU TALK HYDRATION THE SLOWER AND STEADY YOU CAN GO THE BETTER IN FACT THE REASON THES THIS TWO MILEADERS PROKILEGRAM INUMBER CAME OUT IS BECAUSE A NUMBER OF TRIALS WERE RUN WET THEY LOOK THAT THAT EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES JUST ONE BULLEST OF IT YOU KNOW I IN DIFFERENT DARATIONS IN IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE SLOWER PACE ONE COULD DO IT THE BATTER SO WHETHER YOU'RE DOING AT EVERY TEN MINUTES OR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES THE REASON WE ACTUAULD GIVE THAT GAP IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE ALSO OFFSET A LITTLE BIT IY I DISTRESS IN FACT LIKE CON OF THEM THE FOUR GOLDEN RULES OF RECOVERY IF YOU WILL A WE USE SORT OF THREE YARS YOU NEED TO REBUILD REHYDRATE AND REPLENISH WUT THAT REALLY MEANS IS YOU NEAN TO HAVE A CONTINUOUS GLUCO STREAM YEAD TO HAVE IT CONTINUOUS MEO ASSED STREAM YOU NEED TWO HYDRATE AND YOU NEED TO DO ALL ONE TWO AND THREE WITHOUT DISTURBING YOUR GOT TOO MUCH AND SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS SORT OF FOUND THAT WE CAN HIT THAT LEVEL IN GENERAL AND BE JUST FIND FOR MOST PEOPLE SO AMMA LITTLE BIT A CONTECTS THE EXAMPLE WE GAVE THERE IN BOTH CASES IT'S SOMETHING LIKE SIX TO SEVEN OUNCES FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THERE'S SIXTEEN OUNCES IN A POUND AND MOST WATER BOTTLES LIKE IF YOU GO BY A WATER BOTTLE OF STORE HERE IT'S THEY GENERALLY COME IN LIKE SIXTEEN OUNCE BOTTLES IF SO SIX OR SEVEN OUNCES IS REALLY LIKE A THIRD OF A WATER BOTTLE MAYBE EVERY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OR SO MINUTES SO IT'S NOT SOME AGREEGOUS AMOUNT OF WATER THAT YEVE TO SIME THOT NOW THAT IS INFLUENCE HEAVILY BY HOW HIDRATED YOU STARTED THE SESSION WITH SO HOW HIGHER YOU CAME IN EXTERNAL FACTORS LIKE HEAT HUMINITY TEMPTR THINGS LIKE THAT BUT HAT GIVES YOU A ROUGH IDEA THAT AGAIN IN THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO CONSUME TWO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE AT THE END OF THAT THEN IS WHEN YU WOULD LOOK TO SEE HOW MUCH I LOST LIKE WE TALKED BUTTERLEER AND THEN ADD BACK THAT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PER CENTS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HOW MUCH FLUID YOU INJUSTED SO IF YOU'RE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND YOU DRANK A TOTAL OF SAY A POUND OF WATER DURING THE TRAINING AND YOU TART OFF A TWO HUNDRED AND OU FINISHED AT ONE NINETY EIGHT YOU ACTUALLY LOST THREE POUNDS NOT TWO POUNDS BECAUSE YOU LOST THREE YOU DRANK ONE DURING IT SO YOUR FINAL NET NUMBER IS TWO SO NOW YOU DON'T YOU REALLY NEED TO DRINK BACK HUNDER AND TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THAT REMAINING TWO POUNDS TWO AND HALF POUNDS SOMMN LIKE THAT I'M THESE NUMBERS ESPECIALLY THAT ONE TWENTY FIVE ARE THEY'RE JUST ROUGH GUIDE LINES A SOME MACTURI PAPERS SUGGESTITS ALL THE UP TO HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT I'M SO HE'S IS JUST LIKE AN IDEA DON'T MEASURE OUT WHETHER YOU NEED FIVE POINT FIVE OUNCES OR SIX POINT TWO OUNCIS LIKE IT JUST SORTO GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF A WERE TO STAR ARET A FEW SIPS EVERY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES I'S CLOSE ENOUGH IVE ACTUALLY START USING A THE GALOPIN OQUATION TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH FLUID I NEED FOR MENTAL WORK GIVEN THE O ROBUST DED A THER'RE OUT THERE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HYDRATION AND MENTAL WORK ITS A'M BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE FOR ME AND AGAIN THERE PUREVIEUED STUDIES THAT THE SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT HYDRATION IS IMPORTANT FOR A PROPER MENTAL CLARITY AND ENERGY AND FOCUS AND THAT EVEN BEING SLIGHTLY THE HYDRATE CAN DESTRUPT THAT BUT IF ONE IS DRINKING SO MUCH WATER THAT THEY'RE FREQUENTLY GOING TO THE REST ARUM AN CAN'T  COMFORTABLY A FOCUS ON THE WORK THEYRE DOING THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE SO AM THAT'S VERY HELPFUL WHAT ARE THE THREE MOST CRITICAL FEATURES OF HYDRATION AND THEN I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO AM SOME OF THE MORE PARTICULARS ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION AND RETRETION THREE PARTS START HYDRATED MAINTAIN HYDRATION THROUGHOUT PART THREE IS HYDRATE POST TO FEX AT FOQUET WE GAVE YOU THE HALF OUNDS PROPOUND A BODY WEIGH OQUATION SO YOU START THE TRAINING HYDRATE WE GAVE YOU THE TO MILITATOUS FOR KILL A GROUND SLASH BODY WEIHT DIVIDED BY THIRTY TO STAY HYDRATEN WE GIVE THE ONE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT I'M BUT I CAN ACTUALLY JUST GIVE YOU SORT OF I'M GIVING YOU ANOTHER LIST HERE I'M SORRY BUT IT IS MY FIVE STEP CEATER GUIDE FROP THEMIZING HYDRATION FOR PERFORMANCE ARE A STEP NUMBER ONE DRINK A LOT OF WATER FIRST THINGIN THE MORNING THIS GETS EVER IN KICK STAR TO GET YOU GOING IT ALSO SAVES YOU FROM HAVING A DRINK A BUNCH OF WATER AT NIGHT WHICH IS THEN GOING TWO COMPROMISEOUSLY WHAT'S A LOT TO PENNY AN HOW BIG YOU ARE THE GENERAL THING I'LL TELL PEOPLE IS LIKE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY YOU WAKE UP GO THE BATHROOM AS YOU'RE CONSUMING YOUR SUN LIGHT CONSUME WATER THIS IS MAYBE CHUGGING A FULL GLASS IT'S ON I SEE WHAN I DO IS NOT THE BEST OR OUT BUT ALL TO S SIXEN OUNCE O SIXTEEN OUNCES OR SO AS GREAT IT'S FINE IF YOU'RE LARGER AM OU I'M I'M A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE TO SEVENTY POUNDS TO PENNING ONCE GOING ON MAYBE THE HIHER SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE TWO AND A TWENTY FIVE POUNDS MAYBE THAT NUMBERS THIRTY OUNCES SO YOU A SORT OF SCALE UP AND DOWN AND THE OLY REASON I SAY LOT IS IT JUST DEPENDS ON ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I'LSOST YO CLARIFY I DON'T REALLY LITERALLY MEAN CHUG TIS LIKE SIPS CAUSE THE FASTER YOU DRINK WATER THE FASTER ITS CAN EXPAND BLOOD VOLUME THE FAST STREET EXTANDS BLOOD VOLUME THE FASTER YOU GET RID OF IT IM I DON'T THING A LOT PEOPLE KNOW THAT YET THIS IS A MABIIS CLARIFYING THIS IS ALSO WE SORT OF TALKD ABOUT EARLIER IF YOU DRINK TO MUCH WATER YOU'LL DELUTE THE SYSTEM WELL IF YOU HAVE A DELUDED SYSTEM YOUR BODY'S FIRST REACTION IS TOO RID OF WATER TO BRING TOTAL BLOOD VOLUME DOWN RIGHT REMEMBER IF YOU'RE TO GO A DOCTOR ND THEY LOOK TO YOUR TOTAL LOOD VOLUME THERE LIKE MAN YOU'RE FIVE AND A HALF LEADERS YOU'RE GON TO BE LIKE HOLY CRAP YO'RE N TO BE PUT ON A DIRATIC BECAUS YOU DON'T HAVE A HART ATTACK A BOOD PRESSURE I I WONDER IF PEOPLE ARE DRINKING A SIXTEEN OUNCE GLASS OF WATER OR OTHER FLUID ALL AT ONCE BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP AND THAT'S WHY THERE WAY YE ELP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT  TOTALLIC GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID PROBABLY A BETTER AM PROTOCALL WOULD BE TO SIP ON A GLASS OF WATER IN THE FINEALL HOUR O TWO HOURS BEFORE SLEEP YOT GENERALLY THE UMBER WE SAY IS THREE HOURS IN THE THREE HOURS PROCEEDING SLEEP YOU WANT A BASELY LIMIT FLUID AND TAKE TO SIPPING AS NEEDED I THINK THAT'S I'MN TO START THAT TO NIGHT BECAUSE I WAKE UP GENERALLY ONCE PER NIGHT USE VAST ROOM AND I DO DRINK SOME FLUIDS BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP MESSACHISM PRETT THIRSTY AT THAT TIME E AM BUT I' MEAN TO START SIPPING THAT WATER IN THE A THREE HOURS HEADING INTO SLEEP YET YOU SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY PAY TENTION TO IS AM TO GO BACK THI SACTL I LOVE DOING THE STUFF BUT IF YOU'RE WAKING UP AT NIGHT AND YOU HAVE A VERY DRY MOUTH NOT YOR ME I CAUSE IT CAN BE ONE OF TWO THANK YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DEHYDRATED AND SO THET THE MISTAKE PEOPLE MAKE US LIKE MAN MY MOUTH O SO DRY I KEEP GETTING UP TO DRINK WATER AT NIGHT THAT MAKES YOU THIN PEAT TOO MUCH WIT THAT ALSO INDICATES IS PROBABLY YOU'R MOUTH BREATHING SO A LOT OF WAYS TO FIX PEOPLE WAKING UP IN IRRITATING TOO MUCH A NIGHT IS TO TAKE YOUR MOUTH AND OR YUSE A A DILATOR OVER YOUR NOSE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE A HAVE A DRY MOUTHS YOU' GET UP TO CONSUME AN  EXTRA WATER THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT SO THAT ACTUALLY REDUCES  YOUR FLUID INTAKES YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROB OF ACTUALY NOW HAVING TOO MUCH FLUID TO DO IT AND SOES ANOTHER REASONS WHY MOUTH TAPING CAN REREALLY HELP I IF YOU ARE HAVING THOSE ISSUES A AND OR SNORING THOSE ARE NOT BE NINE THAT'S A REALLY THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD GET SOME WORK ON THOSE A SOMETHING YOURNE YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING VERY WELL IS THE WAY I'LL SAY ITS ITS DOESN'T DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN SOMETHING IN LIKE THREATENING BUT IT'S NOT A HE GOD THING SO IM YOU GOT A RUN KIND OF YOUR TREOGING THINGS BACK AND FORTH SO IF YOUR LIKE OM WAKING UP TO PEA LOT BY MY MOUTH ISN'T THIRSTY OT GET GREAT THEN YOU MAY ACTUALLY HAVE JUST A WATER CONSUMPTION ISSUE IF IT IS MY MOUTH IS DRY BUT I'M ACTUALY WAKING UP AND I'M HAVING'S LARGE YOUR NATIONS THEN YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY DEHYDRATED YOU'RE JUST BREATHINGTROUGH YOUR MOUTH IF YOU WAKEN UP AND YOUR MOUTH IS DRY AND THERE'S NOT A OT OF PEE THERE THEN YU ACTUALY MIGHT ATUALLY LEGITIMATE BE I UNDER HIHDRADED SO LITTLE BIT OF A GAME YOU CAN PLAY THERE WELL E SUPERINFORMATIVE I THINK THAT AM THE POINT ALONE THAT GULPING A BUNCH OF WATER ALL AT ONCE IT'S GOING TO CAUSE YOU TO NEED TO EXCREET THAT WATER SOON AFTER AM IS A LY IMPORTANT POINT ALSO FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TOU I GIVE A TALK OR UM YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GET UP TO USE THE RESTRON YE AUT TO IT THROUGH A LONG MEATING YE AM CLEARLY I'M VIOLATING ALL THESE RULES UP UNTIL RAY NOW I'VE BEEN YOU KNOW NOT II TURFALLOW THE SEA GALL APPROACH TE TO CONSUMING FLUDS IS GLEN IN EM ENORMOUS VOLUMES IMONA START STIPPING A FLUIDS INSTEAD A WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER RULES OF HYDRATION SO YOU CAN AWAKE UP YOU TO START YOUR DAY N START HYDRATED SO YOU YOU'R CONSUMING A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF YOUR WATER EARLIER IN THE DAY THEN YOU GET ALL THE PERFORMANCE ENHANCING EFFECTS OF WATER AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A COMPROMISIN YOUR SLEEP SO THAT'S THAT NUMBER ONE ALSO NOW YOU TO START YOUR SESSION CLOSER TO HYDRATION RI GRA NUMBER TOO EAT MOSTLY REAL WHOLE FOODS WHY INTERESTING WHAT YOU MAY OR NOT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IS A HUGE DETERMINATE OF YOUR HYDRATION SATIS IS YOUR FOOD CHOICES IF YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT FOODS FOR EXAMPLE MOST FRUIT A WATER MELON WATER MELON IS LIKE NINETY FIVE FLUSS PER CENT WATER FANTASTIC SOURCE ALSO BY THE WAY SINCE WE'RE HERE IT IS NOT EXTREMELY HIND CARBIDRATS NOT STRING EXTREMELY HIND SUGAR IT IS MY PERCENTAGE BUT SINCE IT IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WATER YOU'RE EATING IT IS NOT O SOMETHING THAT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS INTROMS H SUGAR AM I THERE ALONE PROBABLY ALL THE THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TH SIX SIX EPISODES O THAT COMMON RIGHT THERE WILL PROBABLY BLOW THE INTRD AT THE PIECES AND LL PROLEGET HATEMAILE FOR LIFE FOR IT BUT FROM PEOPLE DO SUGAR R WATER MELINS YE YE YE MY GOI OING THE POINT IS THAT SUGAR IS ATURLY BAD I THINK THE POINT IS THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE THEY'RE INJESTING TOO MUCH SUGAR MOST PEOPLE YE IM AND IT'S INTERESTING OFTENTEMES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUSTIFYING THE INJESTION OF SUGAR EXACTLY THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NOT INJUST SO MUCH SUGAR SO THERE'S A NO BIT OF A WELL I USE ER VIS THE O HERE IS IF YOU'RE EATING WHOLE REAL FOOD THIS IS LIKE NOW R WORK ON OF SPLITTING AIRS ABOUT THEY SING SO SO MORNING HYDRATION CEATS MO ROUD YA NOW IMPORTANT POINT HERE IF YOU COMPARE TO OTHER FOODS I LIKE ATY MEAT IS IS A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FLUID AT DEPENNING ON HOW WELL OR LONG YOU'VE COOKED IT YOU WIL RISEN'T REMB YOU SED EARLIER OR SEVENTY PER CENT WATER RIGHTS IF YOU'RE EATING MEAT YOU'RE GETTING ACTUALLY A BIG CHUNK OF WATER AS YOU COOK IT OF COURSE YOU LOSE SOME ON THAT BUT MEAT CAN BE LIKE I WOULDN'T CALL IT A HYDRATING FOOD ITEM BUT IT IS NOT AS LOW AS SOMETHING LIKE A BISCUIT WHICH CAN BE ACTUALLY LIKE TEN PER CENT WATE THAT'S WHY 'S LIKE DRY IN DENSE WHICH DOESN'T MEANS BAD FOR YOU BUT THERE IF YOU'RE EATING HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS ALMOST BY ASSOCIATION THAT MEANS THY'VE BEEN DEHYDRATED OR PORTIALLY RIGHT SO YOU'RE JUST GETTING LESS TOTAL FLUID INTECT IN ADDITION THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN HIGHLY SALTED IN GENERALRIGHTES AN HOUR IN THIS POSITION WERE WERE UNDER HYDRATED AND HIGHLY SALTED BAD SPOT IF YOU NOW SWITCH OVER TO MOSTLY THEY GET JUST MOSTLY WHOLE REAL FOOD ISH WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO YOU THEN YOU'RE HYDRATION IS CIN  SKY ROCKET YOU CAN'T HAVE A LOT SO YOU'RE EATING A TON OF FOOD IN FACT IT SHOULD BE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE FLUID AND TAKE YOU HAVE ACTUALLY SHOULD BE COMING FROM YOUR FOOD YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE SMASHING WATER BOTTLES AFTER WATER BOTTLE ALL DAY IN THAT CASE THO YOU DO NEED TO ADD SALT BACK SO WE DO SEE THIS A LOT WE PEOPLE W TRY TO MAKE A TRANSITION FOR MAY BE A SUBBOPTIMAL NTRITIONA LIFE STYLE AND TH THEY GIVE UP A LITTLEB OTHER PROCESS FOOD THAT COME OVER THEY START HAVING PROBLEMS BECAUSE HE'RE NOT ACTUALLY CONSUMING ENOUGH SALT SO AT THAT BACK EASY WAY TO DO THAT YOU CAN USE ELECTROLIGHTS END WE COULD TALK ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS IF YOU WANT IF YOU JUST SALT YOUR FOOD THAT YOU'RE MAKING OU KN TO TASTE THAT'S GINTO GATE MOST PEOPLE IN AND A PRETTY GOOD SPOT SO START HYDRATED CONSUME HYDRATING FOODS STEP NUMBERTUTES TEPNUMBER THREE YOU WANT A PRE HYDRATE IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO WORK OUT SESSION AND IT'S GOIN TO BE HOT AND LONG OR ONE OF THOSE THINGS  YOU WANT A LOOK FOR THAT HAT A POUND AA PURBODY WEIGHT OF OUNCES SO THAT'S THE NUMBER WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO START OUR HYDRATION SESSION WE DO THAT WE'RE RETTY MUCH TADENT CAREAP AND THEN I GAS IT A JUST DEPENDING ON LIFE STYLE HUMINITY AND AND OTHER FACTORS LIKE THAT IM YOU CAN USE WHAT IS CALLED THE WHAT SYSTEM W UT I THINK BOB KENNIFICT WHOS DONE A TONA RESEARCH IN THIS HERE IF YOU WANT O READ MORE LOOK UP HIS RESEARCH IM IT IS SIMPLY WEIGHT YOU'RE IN AND THIRST SO ANOTHERS CHECK YOUR BODY WEIGHT LOOK AT YOUR YORE IN COLOR AND ENGAGE YOUR THIRST AND ACTUALY YOU CAN USE THROUE THOSE THREE THINGS AND THOSE A CAN SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICT ACTUAL HYDRATION SATIS INDEPENDENT OF ACTUALLY MEASURING OSMOOLA OR HAS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THOSE THREE METRICS ALONE ARE PRETTY GOD INDICATOR OF WEARE YOUR OT SO YOU CAN HAVE THAT NOMAL AMOUNT OF WATER PLUSERMINIS IF YOU MISS THAT NUMBER FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU GT DISTRACTED THE NUMBER WE TYPICALLY SO PEOPLE IS LIKE SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED O FIVE HUNDRED MILLILEERES OF WATER I IN THE HOUR PROCEEDING THE TRAINING RIGHT SO THAT'S LIKE THIRTEEN TO TWENTY OUNCES SO LET YOU KNOW YOUR TOGLA WORK OUT THREE O'CLOCK IT'S TWO O'CLOCK YOU REALIZE A MAN I HAVE NOT DRINK MUCH WATER TODAY I YOU DON'T NEED TO GO SMASH TONS AND TONS AND TONS JUST LOOK FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OU KNOW CALL IT A BOTTLE OF WATER IF YOU WILL IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH IF YOURN A REALLY TOUGH SPOT YOU CAN DO MORE LIKE A FIVE TO EIGHT OUNCES FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE EXORCISE YOU WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT DRINKING A MUCH O WATER LIKE IN THE SECONDS BEFORE EXTROCIZE BECAUSE YOURE JUSE CON TO FEEL A WHOLE MUNCH OF WATER BALANCING UP AND DOWN ING YOUR STOMACH AND NOBODY LIKES THAT SO ONE TO THREE UNDRED MILL LEADERS FIFTEEN OR SO TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE M THAT ASSUMES YOU'RE IN THIS LIKE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE POUND A RANGE ISH AGAIN IF YOU'RE TALK AND PEOPLE OF MUCH LARGER SIZE YOU MAY BE T INCREASE TOSE VALUES ACCORDINGLY IF YOU DO ALL THAT THEN YOU USE A GALLOPIN A COATION FOR YOUR INTRA WORK OUT HYDRATION AND YOUREN'T A RETTY GOD SPOT I WHAT YOU WANT TO CONSUME IN THAT IS WHAT I CALL SWET WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANOT NECESSARILY CONSUME WATER ONLY DURING THE WORK OUT YOU OUGHT TO CONSUME SOMETHING THAT IS I SAW OSMOTIC TO YOUR BLOOD SO SOMETHING THAT IS THE SAME CONCENTRATION THAT YOU LOST IN YOUR SWEAT SO IF YOU'VE DONE A SWET TEST YOU WOULD THEN DRINK EIT FLUID THAT IS IS OF THE SAME OSMAOLITY A THE SHORT VERSION OF THAT SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED MILEGRAMS OF SODIUM MOST ELECTROLIGHTS A PRODUCTS ARE N TO BE SOMETHNG LIKE THAT NOW I KNOW ELEMENT IS IS A THOUSAND MILEGRAMS AS A LOT HIGHER BUT MOST PRODUCTS NOW THAT YOU CAN FIND OUR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLIUM AND ARE TYPICALLY IN THE LIKE TO THO MAYBE UP TO THREE TO ONE SODIUM TO PATASSUM RANGE RIGHT COCANAT WATER IS ACTRICOOLIST IT'S LIKE BASELY OPPOSITE I'M LIKE A CUPO COCONUT WATER I THINK HAS SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED A MILEGRAMS OF SODIA BE LIKE SIX HUNDRED TE GRAMS UPTASSUM SO A LIKE TOTAL SPOILEER BUT WELL WE USE COCONUT WATER LOT OF HYDRATION DISADLET UP INCTA SALT IS OT TO RING THE SODIUM WAY BACK UP YET ONE NOTE ABOUT SODIUM A OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREHA PRETENSION OR HI PRETENSION WONT TO BE CAREFUL WITH THEIR SODI MEN TAKE UM IN TIME I'VE SUGGESTED THAT PEOPLE MIGHT CONSIDER IN JESTING MORE SODIUM YOUNSOAT'S ILIKE PUTTING A TARGET ON YOUR ON YOU'RE BACK AND YET THE DATE ARE PRETTY GOOD SHOWING THAT IF PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SODIUM THEI'R MENTAL CLARITY THEIR FOCESS THEIR A MENTAL STAMINA THEIR PHYSICAL STAMNA REALLY SUFFERS AND THEN PEOPLE ARGUE WELL MOST OF US ARE GETTING TOO MUCH SALT THAT OFTEN IS TRUE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE EATING A LOT OF PROCESS FOODS AND NOT TRAINING AND NOT TRAINING BUT FOR MANY A PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY S OR OF HEALTH CONSCIOUS WHO ARE TRAINING THEIR LARGELY CONSUMING WHERE I SHOULD SAY THEI'RE CONSUMING LARGELY NON PROCESS OR MINUMLY PROCESS FOODS AND ESPECIALLY FOR FOLKS WHO ARE NOT IN JESTING MANY CARBOHYDRATES AND ARE CONSUMING KAFFEN OR NO LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT CARBOHYDRATES HOLD WATER A AND THAT MAKES A SOUND BAD IS NOT SOLLY YOU NR YOU CAN GET SUBCUTANEOUS SWELLING OF YOUR BODY O'S FOR COGR IT'S IT'S BRINGING WATER IND YOUR SYSTEM IN IT HOLDS WATER SO WHEN YOU DROP CARBOHYDRATE STARCHES IN PARTICULAR YOU URANATE A LOT MORE AND WHEN YOU DRINK KAFFIN YOU ALSO YOURE AN ATE A LOT MORE AS AS YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER SO YOU START COMBINING A FEW THINGS LIKE SLIGHTLY LOWER CARBHYDRED OR LOW CARBOHYDRATE EATING REALLY COTINCO CLEAN OU NOT GETTING A LOT OF SALT IN YOUR FOOD AND DRINKING AFFINE AND THEN EXERCISING AND THEN PRETTY SOON THOSE NUMBERS THAT COME ALONG WITH A YOU KNOW A GRAM OF SODIUM IN YOUR ELECTRO LIKDRINK ARE NOT ALL THAT OUTRAGEOUS AND WHAT YOU FIND HIS PEOPLE FEEL MUCH MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY'RE GETTING ENOUGH SODIUM AND OF COURSE I SHOULD AM SAY THAT THERE'S NO REASON WHY SOME ONE HAS TO INJEST A A SUPPLEMENT LIKE ELEMENT OR SOMETHING THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WAYS TO BRING SODIMEND YOUR SYSTEM ME GUVES OF A PINCH OF PINK SALT OR HIM ALAN SALT OR SEE SALT OR EVEN JUST TABLE SALT IN WATER OR JUST MAKE U SURETHAT YOU'R SALTING YOUR FOOD ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE TO SALT APPETITE AND SALT TASTES A PRETTY GOOD GUIDE IF YOU TASTE SOMETHING N IF YOUO TASTE REALLY SALTY TO YOU THAT'S AN INDICATION THAT EITHER IT'S REALLY SALTY OR YOURE SALT STORES ARE AND OF TAPPED OFF YOURE OCA WERE AS IF YOU'R CRAVING SALT AND YOU IN YOU'R THINKING COT I REALLY WANT TO PUT SALT ON THIS ALREADY SALTY THING NOT NECESSARILY BUT OFTENTIMES THAT MEANS THAT YOUAR SALT DEFICION SHO SALT APPETITE IS A PRETTY HARD WIRED SET OF NERAL CIRCUITS AND HORMONES AND I THINK AN WE WOULD ALL BE WISE TO LEARN TO TAP IN TO THE OR KIND OF INTUITION ABOUT SALT AND TAKE BUT OF COURSE ALSO TO MEASURE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE ET CETERA YEAVE OF COURSE IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF CONTRADICATION THERE THE WORK IF THE MEDICAL SPECIALIST WITHOUT WITHOUT QUESTION IM THOSE SITUATIONS YOU LAID OUT THOUGH ARE VERY REALL LOT PEOPLE AR LIVING LIKE THAT AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THOSE FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU ARE GOING THROUGH SYMPTOMS FATIGUE I LACK OF FOLCAS A COGIN O FUNCTION PERFORMANCE ISN'T THERE THEN HEY LIKE YOU MAY BE UNDER SALTED AND AGAIN ACTUALLY A A GOOD AMOUNT OF BLOOD CHEMISTRY WORK CAN UNRAVELE TAT A LOT AN I CON SORT OF TELL YOU IF YOU'RE GOTTING ON A ACK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SO DOM AND TRIMS OF HEALTH RISK AND THAT THAT IS A REAL THING AGAIN WORK WITH YOURE I INDIVIDUAL FOLKS ON THAT I DON'T WORK WITH ANY ONE FOR A DISEASE TREATMENT OR MANAGEMENT AT ALL I'VE SAID THAT PROBY FOUR TIMES WI'LL SAY IT SIX MORE TIMES I ONLY TAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE HEALTHY AND TRYNG TO MAKE A PERFORM AT THEIR BEST POSSIBLE LEVEL SO IT'S ACTUALLY FEN YOU MENTION TAT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE F MY RECOMMEDATION FOR SODIOU MEN TAKE IN GENERAL THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND I DECIDED I'M NOT I SAY THAT CAUSE ALL IT'S GOING TO DO ISO MAKE ALL THE REST THE PEOPLE WHO ARRENT COMING AND COME AFTER ME FOR THE WATER MELIN COMMENT COME AFTER ME FOR THAT SO ALL THAT THE INIDATS APISOE THE GOLL IS THAT THAT EVERYONE'S COMMING AFTER YOU BUT ALSO AAEVERUIN AS LEARNED SOMETHING OF VALU ALREADY I'M GIVEN US A TREMENDOUS A INSIGHTS AND INA ACTIONAL INFORMATION ON CREATINE AND HIDRATION AND ALONG THIS LINES I'D ID LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITH SUPPLEMENTATION IN ORDER TO ENHANCE TRAINING BY TAKING CERTAIN THINGS BEFOREWE TRAIN AND I ALSO HAVE THE QUESTION HOW LONG BEFORE TRAINING SHULD WE START THINKING ABOUT SUPPLYING NEW TRAINTS AND SUPPLEMENTS FOR THE TRAINING SESSION I'M NOT SURE I FACTUALY FINISHED MY FIBR MAYBE I WASN'T CLEARENOUGH ABOUT THE LAST ONE SALL JUST WANE TIE AT THAT BOWLAN AN WILL GO HERE NEXT ONE YET NO WHO'S PRIVE MY FALT SO THAT AIN ADDITION TO THE GALPAN OQUATION TRIMS OF AMOUNT I RECOR MI'VE BEEN A RECOMMENDED AT A ROUGHLY THREE TO ONE SO DME TO PTASCON RECOMMENDATION AND I GAVE YOU SOME ROUGH NUMBERS THINGS LIKE THAT I ACTUALLY AN HONESTY USE PROBABLY SIX TO TEN DIFFERENT ELECTROLIGHT  COMPANIES DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION SOME OF EM ARE REALLY GOOD IN HE CASE AGAIN LIKE ELEMENT IT'S NICE ABOUT THAT IS THERE'S NO CAR BIDRATE HOWEVER THE DOWNSIDE IS THRE'S NO CARBIDRATE SO SOMETIMES I WANT CARBHYDRATES IN THE TRAINING CAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE GOING BACK A ACTUALLY SEVERAL DECADES ON THE BENEFIT OF CAR BAHYDRATE DURING EXERCISE SO IF YOU'REN'N A SITUATION AWHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO AGAIN MAXIMISE ACTUAL EXERCISE PERFORMANCE YOU ESPECIALLY IF IT IS EITHER LONGDURATION SO MORE THAN TWO HOURS OR EXTREMELY HIGH INTENSITY AND THIS HAS TO BE WELL NORTH OF HONOR PRESENT OF YOUR VIEW TO MAX AND THAT SITUATION AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE ENDURANCE EPISODE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY START HAVING A DECRIMENT IN PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OF A DROP OF MUSCLE LIKAGEN A GLIVERLIKET IN CAN CAR SAR COMING DOWN IF THAT'S THE CASE AUGMENTING WITH CAR BAHYDRATES DURING THE TRAINING TAT IS GOING TO AN HANSPERFORMANCE IS GUNIS DO WHAT WE CALL SPARE THE LIVER AND IT'S GIN TO KEEP MY SECOND RULE OF MY FOR WHICH IS MAINTAIN A GLUCOS INJESTION ITS GOIT TO KEEP THAT GOING IN GENERAL WHAT YOU CAN OFFIND IS THE NUMBER IS LIKE A FIVE TO NINE PERSEND GLUCO'S CONCENTRATION IN YOUR FLUD WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE LIKE EXACTLY THE NUMBER THAT MOST ORTSTRINGS HAVE AS WELL AS I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY WET A COCONUT WATER IS THE DOWNSIDE OF SPORT STRINGTHS SINCE WE'RE HERE IS THEY ACTUALLY TEND TO BE UNDERSAULTED AND SO THAT THEY DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH OF THEM IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AREGINGTO SAY SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED GRAHMS OF CAR BAHYDRATE PER HOUR IS THE TARGET AND NOW IF YOU'RE USING THE SORT OF GOUNPANGRUATION IN YOUR SPLITTING THAT UP INTO FIFTEEN A MINRE INTERVALS ITS SOMETHING AGAIN LIKE TWENTY OR SO GRAMS OF CARBS PER FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES IF YOU'RE DOING AGAIN A AN HOUR LONG PLUS TRAINING BOWN SO ADMITTEDLY A HUNDRED GRAMS A IS A BIT MUCH FOR SOME FOC DEPENNIN ON YOUR CISE SO I WOULD RECOMMEND STARTING IN THAT A SIXTY GRAM OR SO RRANGE AGAIN PER HOUR TOTAL AS MUCH GOING TO GET TO AND ONLY IN THE SITUATION WHICH MUSTLE LIKGEN TOPLETION IS BE COMING A LIMITING FACTOR TO PERFORMANCE SO THE OTHER BENEFIT OF THAT IS AS YOU MENTION THAT ACTUALLY DRIVES WATER IN TO THE CELL AND SO YOU GING TO BE IN THAT A NICE SWEET SPOT OF YOU'RE ACTUALLY KEEPING GLUCOS GOING WHICH ISGOIN N HAND'S PERFORMANCE AND YOU'R HELPING HYDRATION AT THE SAME TIME SO THE OTHER LITTLE PART THAT'S SUPPORTAN TO PAY ATTENTION TO HERE IS THE TYPE OF CAR BAHYDRATE MATTERS MSO YOU CAN USE ACTUALLY WHOLE COMBINATION OF THINGS CALLED RESISTANCE ARCHES WHICH I WILL USE FOR A LONG BOUTS OF EXERCISE BUT IN THE MITAABLE WORK OUT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS ON GLUCOS AND FRUCTOS MOSTLY GLUCOS TYPICALLY AT LEAST A TWO OR THREE TOONE RATIO OF CLUCOS TO FRUTOS AND THE REASON IS THOSE ACTUALLY GET INTO TISSUE THROUGH SEPARATE TRANSPORTERS AND SO IT HAPPENS IS ONCE THE GLUCOS TRANSPORTERS FULL YOU CAN'T BRING ANYTHING ELSE IN HOWEVER SINCE FRUCOS COMES IN A SEPARATE ROUTE YOU CAN MACIMIZE TOTAL CAR BAHYDRATE INTAKE BY USING TWO DIFFERENT UNIQUE FORMS THER THERE'S A LOT AWAYS YOU CAN DO THIS A BUT THIS IS WHERE THE MOMENTOUS FUEL PRODUCT IS IS ICBUT SPECIFICALLY HAS THAT EXACTLY IN IT SO IT'S FANTASTIC IM YOU CAN USE FOOD NO PROBLEM YOU CAN USE A COMBINATION OF THINGS LIKE HONEY AND DIFFERENT EASILY ABSORBABLE A AND USIBLE IN THINGS YOU CAN ACTUALY LIKE MAY BE PUT AND AND DRINK I TO GET AWAY WITH SO THER'S LOTS OF ROUSE FOR IT BUT YOU WANT A LOOK IN THAT THAT SORT OF COMBINATION A FIVE TO NINE PER CENT ROUGHLY CLUCOS FOR THAT SO YOU DO NEED TO TRAIN YOUR GUT SO DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND IS A GENERALLYAGOOD RULE DO NOT DO ANYTHING IN YOUR COMPETITION THAT YOU'VE NEVER DONE IN PRACTICE SO TRY THESE FOOD IDEMS TRY THESE AMOUNDS THE CARBOHYDRATE NUMBERS TRY THE SODIAN NUMBERS I TRY THE TOTAL MON WATER START LOW YOU CAN ALWAYS INCREASE WHUT YOU DON'T WANT TO DOS HAVE TO RUN OUT DURING THE MIDDLE OF YOUR SPIN CLASS AND SPRENT TO THE BATH ROOMN HOPE NOBODYIS IN YOUR WAY I WHUCH IN THE LAB WE'VE SEEN WELL TO SAY ACCIDENTS LIKE THAT OCCUR MORE THAN ONCE SO I TO SPE CAREFUL OF YOUR STOMACH I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSER INSIDE TRACKER NSIDE TRACERS OF PERSONALIZED NUTRITION PLATFORM THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDIANE TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTH GOALS I'VE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND WELL BEING CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TEST ONE ISSUE WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TASTAND ANATES US OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT VERIOUS LEVELS OF LIPPIDS AND HORMONES AF METABOLIC FACTORS ET CETERA BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THT INFORMATION INSIDE TRACKER MAKES KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION EXCEEDINGLY EASY THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZE PLATFORM THAT LETS YOU SEE WHAT YOUR SIPPES OIC NUMBERS ARE OF COURSE BUT THEN ALSO WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIOUR OLD DEWS AND DONTS WHAT SORTS OF NEUTRISIONAL CHANGES WHAT SORTS OF SUPPLEMENTATION WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BRING THOSE LEVELS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMAL FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE TO TRY INSIDE TRACKER YOU CAN VISIT INSIDE TRACKOR DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACKERS PLANS AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKOR DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF I REALIZE THAT JUMPD THE GUN A LIL BIDASKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION FOR BEFORE JURING AND AFTER WORK OUT IM BECAUSE WHAT I'M NEGLECTED TO ASK ABOUT WAS TRAINING IN THE FASTED STATE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN AN EARLIER EPISODE BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH HIGH LIGHTING NOW M SOMETIMES THE BEST WAY TO SUPPLEMENT IF YOU WILL A WORK OUT OR PREWORK OUT IS IN JESTING NOTHING I'M ONE OF THESE PEOPLE ACTUALLY PREFER TO DO MY WEIGHT TRAINING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT A M EACH MORNING SOMETIMES HE LIERLIER SOMETIMES ALL BIT LATER I DRINK FLUID WATER AND I DO IN JEST CAFFYN PRIOR TO THOSE A TRAINING DAYS AM ON DAYS WHEN I DON'T TRAIN I DO AS I OFTEN RECOMMEND  PEOPLE DO DELAY MY CAFIN AND TAKE NINETY TO HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING BUT IN ANY EVENT IT'S WATER AND CAFFY IN YEURBROMATE OR COFFEE OR SOME SORT OF STIMULANT FOR WEIGHT TRAINING WORK OUTS AND GENERALLY NOT FOR CARDY OF ASKULAR TRAINING WORK OUTS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES YES SO I'M TRAINING FASTED THAT SAID I'M INJESTING CARBHYDRE THE IGHT BEFORE TO MAKE SURE THAT MY I HAVE GLIKAGEN STORES THAT ARE TOPPED OFF AND A SO IT'S FASTED BUT WITH THAT COFYOT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TRAINING FASTED AND WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS FASTED VERNIGHT BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE TRAINING IN THE AFTERNOON AND THEY MAY OPT TO NOT EAT ANYTHING IN THE YOU KNOW TO TO FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO TRAINING OR MAYBE EVEN LONGER I PERSONALLY FIND THAT KAFFINE HIT'S MY SYSTEM A LOT BETTER WHEN I'M FASTED BETTER MEANING TI SEEMS HAVE MORE OF A POTENT EFFECT THERE'S SOME REASONS FOR THAT UM AND OF COURSE WE DISSUADE PEOPLE FROM IN JESTING KAFFINE TOO LATE IN THE DAY CASZILL TO STRUP SLEEP SO I'M NOT SAYING FAST HAT AT FOR THREE HOURS THAN DRINK KAFI BUT WHO KOWS MAYBE THAT'S IN YOUR PROTOCALL THE SIMPLE VERSION OF THIS QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TRAINING FASTED AND IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TRAIN FASTED HOW SHOULD THEY MODULATE THEIR FLUID IN TAKE IF IT ALL WHAT HAPPENS WITH EXERCISE IN THE ENDURANCE AND METABOLISM EPISODE WE WALK THROUGH IN THE FACT THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE USING FORFUEL CAR BAHYDRATES OR FAT OR EVEN A OTHER PETENTIAL SOURCES THE END PRODUCT OF ALL OF THOSE IS E T P SEAL TO AND WATER RIGHT SO YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE E T P THAT IS THE FUEL FOR EXERCISE NOW H T P IS A DENISIN TRY PHOSPHATES SO ONE TO THREE PHOSPHATES ON TOP OF ANEDENISINE WELL WHAT YOU MAY HAVE NOT PUT TOGETHER IS IF YOU HYDREALIZE A T P AND YOU BREAK OFF ONE OF THE SPHOSPHTES YOU NOW HAVE A D P IF YOU DO IT AGAIN YOU HAVE A MP A DENSING MONOPHOSPHITE IF YOU DO IT ONE MORE TIME NOW YOU JUST HAVE A DENISINE AND IF YOU HAVE THEN THEREFORE RUN THROUGH A LOT OF EXERCISE BURN A LOT OF ENERGY YOU HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF A DENISING THAT'SFLOATING AROUND NOW IF YOU HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF A DENISINE WHAT SECOND  MAKE YOU WANT TO DO THAT'S CON O BIND ISTERN RECEPPERS AND WE KNOW WHEN THOSE SIPPERCEPPERS GET BOUND TO YOU FALL ASLEEP BANGO KAFFENE WELL COMPETITIBLY BYIND TO THOSE RECEPTORS THEREFORE THAT'S WHY KAFFINE STOPS YOU FROM FEELING LIKE YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP RIGHT SO WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXERCISE FUEL IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE THEREIS A PRETTY CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT MORE CLORIC EXPENDITURE IN DIFFERENT SPORTS AND THE HIGHER AMOUNT OF HOURS NEEDED FOR SLEEP SO THERE IS A NICE TIGH BETWEEN HOW HARD YOU'R EXERCISEING HOW MUCH ENERGY YOU'RE BURNING HOW MUCH YOU TO SLEEP STIMULANTES WHICH BRINGS US ALL WAY BACK YOUR QUESTION OF FUELING SO DO I NEED A FUEL PRIOR TO MY EXERCISE ABOUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIMITED IN YOUR EXERCISE ABOUT BY FUEL THEN FUELING IS NECESSARY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IF IT IS A TYPE OF TRAIN THAT IS NOT THAN IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER AND SO THE EXAMPLES WE GAVE IF YOU'RE DOING IF YOU'RE GONG A GO DO A THIRTY SECOND ABOUT OF MAXIMAL EXERTION AND YOURE GON TO DO AT ONE TIME YOU DO'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT FEELING AT ALL WERE EATING WITHIN YOUR WORK OUT CAUS ONLY THO RE SECTHIRTY SECON YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT HYDRATION POST EXERCISE YOU'T ENDORRY BY RECOVERY TOTAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE WIS NOTHING IF YOU'RE OING TO GO YOU KNOW YOU CAN TO GO PRACTICE GOING TO GO TO THE DRIVING RAI NGE AND PRACTISE YOUR COLF SWING YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE IS JIS NOT HIGH IN FACT IN THAT CASE YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IT SOMEWHAT LOW BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KEEP BLOOD GLICLOS FAIRLY EVEN AND YOU DON ONT A BINGING N THE SYSTEM YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANTO YOU STIMULANTS IYOU MAY GET OVER EXERT INSIDE IN ALL OF THESE THINGS WE PROBABLY SHOULD HA STARTED OFF OUR CONVERSATION WITH THIS IN TERMS OF MACKERO NEW TRANE THE TOTAL AMOUNT THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS MORE IMPORTANT GENERALLY THEN THE TIMING OF THEM WHICH IS WHY YOU CAN DO THINGS LIKE HAVE OF MUNCO CAR BAHYDRATE AT NIGHT NOT EAT THE NEXT MORNING AND LIFT AND BE JUST FINE IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT OU DIDN'T HAVE THEM IN A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOU'R MUSCLE LIKE AGIN IS TOPED OFF YOUR LIVERS LIKEGEN HIS TOPPED OFF YOU'RE ABSOLUTE FIND YOU PLUNTY IF YOUL EVEN IF YORYOUR TO WAIT A FEW MORE HOURS IN FACT EVEN IF YOU WERE TO DO CONDITIONING YOUR PROBABLY FINE I HAVE PLENTY ABOUT THE  PREFER TO TO MANY OTHER TRAINCESSIONS FASTEIR THE MORNING FOR PERSONAL REASONS NOT BECAUS IN HANS IS PERFORMANCE BUT IF IT DOESN'T ENHANCE OR I HARMIT THEN AND IT'S A PERSONAL PREFERENCE THING FINE IF YOU GEN TO GO DO A SESSION THOU'GL WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY CONCERN IT MUSCLE LIKE AT IN TOPLETION AND AGAIN YOUD GO BACK THAT ABSODE TO LEARN I DIFFERENT TYPES WHEN THOSE THRESHALS HISON WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT THEN IF FEELING WOULD BE IMPORTAN YU WOULD EITHER NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING BEFORE THE SESSION OR CONSUME IT DURING THE SESSION SO ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE LIKE TO STAY HERE IS RECOVERY STARTS DURING THE PREVIOUS WORK OUT RIGHT SO IF YOUR WORK IN OUT RIGHT NOW AND YOU OPTIMIZE NUTRICION RIGHT NOW EVEN IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED IT FOR THE CURRENT WORK OUT IF YOU CN'T GET A HEAD ON RECOVERY THEN YOURE GET TO BE FYING THE NEXT DAY AND THE DIFFERENTIATION HERE BETWEEN CAR BOHYDRATE AND PROACHINGIS IMPORTANT SO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PROCING YOU IN JUST THROUGHOUT THE DAYIS PROBABLY A BIGGER DETERMINIT FOR THINGS LIKE MUSCLE GROWTH THEN THE TIMING SO THE POSTS EXERCISE ANABOLIC WINDO IT DOESN'T  NECESSARILY MATTER CARB BAHYDRATE IS DIFFERENT THE TIMING OF THAT DOES MATTER IT NEEDS TO BE AROUND THAN AVAILABLE YOU CAN MAXIMIZE BOTH HYDRATION AND MUSCLED LIKE AGE IN RE SYNTHESIS WHICH IS RESTORING THE MUSCLE LIKE AGING YOU BURN DURING EXERCISE I I ALSO WORK WITH APLYT SET TRAIN MULTIPLE TIMES O DAY SO THOSE PARTICULAR CASES A RECOVERY WINDOW IS HAF BUT YOU NORMALLY HAVE SO IF YOU'REIN A SITUATION WHEN YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE YOU WORK OUT AGAIN YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING CAR BA HYDRATE AND BEFORE DURING OUR AFTER TBECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU GO TO TRAIN AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE RESTORED YOUR MUSCLE LIKE ITIN LEVELS EASILY HOWEVER I YOU'RE TRAINING EVERY DAY OR TWICE IN A DAY THEN THE TIMING OF CAR BAHYDRATE REALLY STARTS THE MATTER IN THAT CASE I SEE NO REASON TO NOT IN JST  THOSE NUTRIANS EITHER BEFOR DURING OUR AFTER YOU DN'T NEEDN'T NEED IT NECESSARILY DO IT BUT YOU CAN THE GENERAL RULETHUM I GIVE IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS IM IF YOU' DOING SOMETHING WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO REALLY WORK HARD WHETHER THIS IS HYPERCHRY TRAINING OR A LOT OF ENDURANCE ENERGY EXPENDITURES CAN BE HIGH BUTSENTIAL MUSCLE DAMAGEIS HIGH AND OR ENERGY OUTILIZATION IS HIGH WUT YOU WANT A LOOK FOUR IS A NUMBER SOMETHING IN THE AREA OF LIKE HALF A GRAHM OF CARBA HYDRATE PERPOUND OF BODYWEIGHT SO YOU A TWO HUNDRED POUNDS YOU WANT O MAKE SURE THAT EITHER PREMID OR POST OR TOTAL YOU BRING IN A HUNDRED GRAMS OF CARBAHYDRATE ITS JUST A VERY ROUGH NUMBER TO START PROTINE IS ABOUT HALF OF THAT SO IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER OF YOUR BODYWEIGHT RIGHT SO THOSE NUMBERS WOULD BE IF YOU'R TWO HUNDRED POUNDS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A HUNDRED GRAMS OF CARBS AND FIFTY GRAMS OF PROTINE I AND AGAIN IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE BEFORE OR DURING OR AFTER AND YOU'LL BE IN A GOOD SPOT ALL YOU NEED TO DO THEN IS ALTER WHAT I DO I SHOULD SAY IS ALL THROUGH THE AMOUNT OF CAR BA HYDRATE BASED ON ENERGY EXPENDITURE SO A LOWER ENERGY AND EASIER WORK OUT INSTEAD OF HAVING A HUNDRED GRAMS OF CARBS I MIGHT TACK THAT DOWN TO SEVENTY FIVE OR EVEN FIFTY AND BE AT A ONE TO ONE CARB PROACHING RATIA IF IT WAS EVEN HARDER MORE SON HOTTER OUTSIDE MORE FLUID LOSS I MIGHT GO FROM A HUNDRED GRAMS OF CARBS UP TO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED AIT CLOSER LIKE A THREE TO ONE OR FOR TO ONE CAR BAHYDRATE EPPROACHING RATIA SO THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT I GENERALLY GO BY WELL AS I TAKE A SIP OF MY DOUBLEST PRESSO AMERICONO YOU'RE ID LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US ABOUT STIMULANTS SURE THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF THESE IN MOST OF OUR LIVES AND OF COURSE YOU CAN COVER THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF IT LATER YOU MAYBE YOU HAVE AN ABSODE YES WE HAVE AN EPISODE ON CAFFENG AND IT DOES HAVE CERTAIN HEALTH BENEFITS ALTHOUGH ONE HAS TO USE CAFINE CORRECTLY IN ENDER TO DRIVE THAS SO THERE'S CAFFINE IS THE EASY ONE O STRUGGLE WITH AND WE WON'T BELABOR THE POINT HERE THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG IT IT HAS AN ERGEGANC EFFECT A YOU CAN TAKE IT AT WHATEVER DOSAGE IS REASONABLE FOR YOU ND OF COURSE THERE IS A BIT OF A LEARNING CURVEF THERE SUCH THAT I  SEE THE MORE YOU TAKE IT THE MORE YOU NEED TO TAKE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME RECENT EVIDENCE SHOWING EVEN FOLKS WHO ERE A ACCLAMETED TO IT WILL STILL SEE AN URGGENIC  BENEFIT EVEN KNOW IF THEY DON'T FEEL A BIGBOST OF IS SO TYPICALLY THAT TAKES THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES OR SO BUT IT'S HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE PERSON SOME PEOPLE CAN SMELL COFFEE AND IMMEDIATELY FEEL BETTER AND THAT'S PROBABLY WORKING ACTUALLYTHROUGH A DIFFERENT MECHANISM OF ANTICIPATION BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT THERE IT HALF LIFE OF IT IS OU ON FOUR TO SIX HOURS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I AND WHOLLY DEPENDS THE PERSON SO DON'T LET IT ROOM YOUR SLEEP BUT IF YOU TAKE IT PRIOR TO PERFORMANCE IT HAS A A NOTICEABLE A FACT ON A PARTICULALY IN DURRANTE A MAXIMUM STRENGTH MAY BE LESS LL QUIC CREALLY LESS SO ON IN FACTS THE DATE ARE MIXED THERE ON WHETHER ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING FOR PEAK STRENGTH ALTHOUGH I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD A RECT WOULD SUGGEST TIT YNO YOU'RE GON TO TAKE IT PRIOR TO TRYING TO TRULY LIFT IS IS HI AS TRYING TO YOU'RL LIFT A ONE APPETITIAN MAXTS OR SIMILAR BUT MOST OF THE THE DOCUMENT EFFECTS ARE ON THE THE ENDURANC PACES ACTIVITIES YES SO MY READ OF THE LITERATURE IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE IN HANCING EFFECTS OF CAF IN ARE THAT ONE TO THREE MILIGRAMS I ONE MAYE SURE THE PEOPLE HEAR THE UNITES CORRECTLY  BLITS THEMSELVES OUT WITH AT KAFIN ONE TO THREE MILIGRAMS PER KILEGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES PRIOR TO EXERCISE HAS A DEFINITE PEFORMANCE ANANCING EFFACT IT AL SO HAS A DEFINITE MENTAL PERFORMANCE IN HANCING EFFECT ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE REGULAR KAFFIN USERS HAVE ABSTAINED FROM KAFFINE FOR ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FIFTEEN DAYS AND AND THAT'S AN EXTREMELY RARE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT EVEN IF THEY HAVE NOT IT APPEARS THAT ONE TO THREE MILEGRAMS PER KILEGRAM A BODYWIGHT OF KAFFINE TAKEN ABOUT I CAN IT'S NOT SUPERPRERCISE AS FAR AS I I CAN SEE A ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE THE EVENT STARTS AM CAN REALLY ENHANCE REACTION TIME AND POWER OUTPUT AND AS AS WELL AS AS YOU MENTION ENDURANCE WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING THE KAFFN EPISODE ONE INTERESTING KAFY AT IT A I DISCOVERED WAS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE NOT KAFFN ADAPTED THEY ARE NOT REGULAR USERS OF KAFFINE THE SUDDEN INTRODUCTION OF KAFFINE CAN REALLY DEGRADE PERFORMANCE MOSTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO OPERATE AT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL HAVEYOU EVER OBSERVED THAT YE A HUNDRED PER CENT FACT THERE'S ACTUALY DEA TO GOING UP AS HIGH AST TEN MILIGRAMS FOR KILEGRAM A BODYWEIGHT WELL WHICH IS IN FACT ON'T YOU CROSS THE FIVE MILIGRAM PER CILEGRAM THRESHOLD YOU WILL START SEEING PERFORMANCE DECRAMENTS SO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY SUCH AS THING OF RUINING YOUR PERFORMANCE WITH TOO MUCH KAFFINE SO MOST PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS IF YOU'RE THINKING WA THEY SAID KAFFIN I'M ALL IN AND D YOU JUST STOPD LISTENING AND NOW YOUGOFIR QUAD THE SPRESSL SHOP BEFORE YOU EVERY TIME YOU GO TO WORK OUT A YOU PROBABLY AE PASSING THAT THRESHOLD IF YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS ONE TO THREE MILIGRAMS FR KILEGRAM BYWAY IF YOU WEIGH A HUNDRED HEETEGRAM THAT'S TWO ND OR TWENTY POUNDS THAT BE SOMETHING LIKE TO TO FIVE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS OF AFFINE WHICH IS LIKE A PRETTY HIGH AMOUNT A BUT YOU KNOW A COFFEE IS GOING TO GET YOU CLOSE AND ESPRESSOLS GOING TO GET YOU SOMEWHAT THAT BALL PARK DEPENNING ON SOURCEES OF SO YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO GO AND BLISTER YOUR BRAIN WITH KAFFINE IN FACT IF YOU DO IS IT'S QUITE COMMON AND FACT LIKELY THAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY MAKE PERFORMANCE WORSE RIGHT YET THE AMOUNT OF KAFFINE IN DIFFERENT COFFEES AND SO DOES ET CETERA COURSE VARIES ONE THING THAT PEOPLE OUGHT TO KNOW IS THAT THE SMALLEST OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AM COFFEES AT THE MOST POPULAR COMMERCIAL VENDOR SA GENERALLY CONTAIN ANYWHERE FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILIGRAMS OF KAFFINE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE SO CALLED MEDIUM AND THE LARGE CONTAIN AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OR ONE GRAHAM OF KAFFIN SO FOR YOU MORNING A LARGE COFFI AT A COMMERCIAL VENDOR A A DRINKERS IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY YOU GET AND A HEADACHE IF YOUR THIRTY MINUTES LATE ON THAT KAFFINE OR A IF YOU CAN'T ACCESS THAT KAFFINE IT ALL OR EVEN IF YOU'RE DRINKING KAP COFFEE EXCUSE ME FROM ANOTHER SOURCE YOU'RE FINDING LIKE THOUG IT'S REALLY NOT DOING IT FOR ME IT'S BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF KAFFINE IN THE NOW COMMERCIALLY SOLD A COFFEES IS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH IT'S ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE STANDARD LOOK UP TABLES THAT YOU'LL SEE ON THE INTERNETE SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT TO DEMONIZE A KAFFN WE CAN PRETTY QUICKLY ADAPT TO IN FORM A TOLERANCE TO AFFINE A SOME PEOPLE NEVER REALLY CAN GET OVER THE GITTERS OTHER PEOPLE AM ARE JUST FINE WELL WITH A EVEN A THOUSAND MELEGRAMS OF KAFFINE BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN DRINKING A LOT OF KAFFINE CONSISTENTLY ANYWAT IT'S ALSO WILDLY INCONSISTENT FROM LOCATION OF LOCATION A THE BRUETYPE THE FUNCTIONOUTY SO YE THAT THE SEF CAN BE VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY REALLY TO A OBJECTIVELY  MEASURE AFFINE AND THATS USE KAFFIN TABLETS AND THEY WORK PRETTY WELL ACTHY A SOME ONE I KNOW A WHOSE A PROMINENT IN THE POD KASPASE USES ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED MELEGRAMS OF KAFFINE IN TABLET FORM COME INED WITH TEA IF SO THEY'VE NOW CONDITION THEMSELVES TO THINK THAT URBALTEA AFY HAS IS KAFFANATING AF FACT BUT A TABLET FORM KAFFINE WHILE I'M NOT RECOMMENDING IT TO TO A OUTRIGHT IT IS GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BEST SENSE OF HOW MUCH KAFFINE YOU CAN TOLERATE IN HOW MUCH IS PERFORMANCE ENHANCING OR S PERFORMANCE DEGRADENG THERE'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER LINE OF SUPPLEMENTATION WE CAN GO DOWN HERE WHICH IS NOT TACHNICALLY STIMULANT BUT IT'S SOMETHING I USE TO HELP PERFORMANCE WHEN YOU DON'T WANT KAFFIN AND SO THIT THINK SPECIFICALLY IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO EXERCISE AT NIGHT AND YOU WANT A LITTLE BIT OF BOOST FOR YOUR TRAINING BUT YOU DON'T ONE HALF KAFINK IS A MESSAS UP YOUR SLEEP AND THIS IS WHEN YOU CAN TURN TO THE WHOLE LIKE CITURALY AN ARGENING NITROCOK SIDE A SORT OF ROUT AND A WILL SKIP THE EXPLANATION THERE BUT EFFECTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOUR COXSITE IS THIS WONDERFUL COMPOUND THAT CAUSES VASAL DNIHILATION AND OF COURSE THAT'S GOING TO AID THEN IN TRANSPORTING NEW TRANS IN AND OUT OF THE CELL I' SO IT HAS AN URGOGENIC EFFECT THE YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS YOU CAN GO ABOUT THIS A SOME OF THEM HAVE MORE PROSE AND CONS AN OTHERS AND IN THERE ARE MORE MORDATA COMING OUT SPECIFICALLY ON SICTRLIN A MORE RECENTLY IF YOU LOOK THOUGH IN MY OPINION THE MOST CONSISTENT EVIDENCE FOR THE MOST CONSISTENT EFFECT IS IN THE SUMPLEMENT OF BEAT ROUT OR BEAT RODUCE OR EXTRACT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU CAN FIND THOSE SUPPLEMENTS AND THEY TEND TO A AGAIN THE PRETTY EFFECTIVE AN EHANCING PERFORM SPECIFICALLY ANYTHING MODERATE TO LONG ER DURATION AND DURNS PERFORMANCE AND THEY ARE NOT A STIMULANT SO THEY WON'T RUIN YOUR SLEEP THAT MUCH ONE A NOTE OF CAUTION AP TOR THOSE WHO E THERE INTERESTED IN SITURLINE OR OR BEAT RUTE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE ARGENINE PATHWAY IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO HAS A A PREDISPOSITION TO COLD SOURCE AM WORLD COLD SOURC THAT IS OR OTHER FORMS OF COLD SOURCE THAT A BECAUSE ACTIVEATION OF THE ARGENINE PAFTHWAYK AN EXASCURBATE SOME OF THE NURL RELATED ASPECTS OF COLD SORTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE VIRS IS THET CAUSE THOSE COLD SORTS ACTUALLY LIVE ON NURONS THAN YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS WITH SITURLY N ESPECIALLY HIGDO SAITTUULINE I CAN REALLY MPLIFY THAT THE COLT SORT RESPONSE WHAT ABOUT NON STIMULANT YET AM FOCUS ENHANCING SUPPLEMENTS THINGS LIKE ALPHAG P C UM FOR EXAMPLE I ROUTINELY USE THREE HUNDRED TO  SIX HUNDRED MELEGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C PRIOR TO HARD PHYSICAL TRAINING TYPICALLY WEIGHT TRAINING BUT OCCASIONALLY I'LL TAKE THREE HNDRED MELEGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C PRIOR TO A MENTAL WORK ABOUT AM LESS OFTEN THESE DAYS CAUSE I KIND OF RESERVE IT FOR PHYSICAL TRAINING AAND I DON'T TEND TO USE IT EVERY DAY I MAY BE ONCE EVERY MEUM THIRD OR FORTH WORK OUT COMBINED WITH CAFFIE SO THAT COMMINATION IS PRETTY A PRETTY POTENT I FIND AND SO TECHNICALLY BECAUSE IT'S A CALLON URGIC AGONIST IT'S NOT A STIMULANT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE BUT IT HAS A AM FOCUSSING AND AN ALERTNESS PROMOTING ASPECT TO IT  WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THOSE SORTS OF COMPOUNDS THEREIS NOT MUCH HUMAN PERFORM EXERCISE PERFORMANE STATE A ON THOSE THERE ARE CERTAINLY A COGNATIVE FUNCTIONING TESTS ON THOSE SO YOU'RE NOT CONOFINED A LOT OF INFORMATION NO THOUGH THERE ISN'T NONE WE ACTUALLY WILL USE MANY OF THESE SUBSTANCES YOU COUL GLOBALY CALL THEM NEUTROPICS WHICH IS O ANY SUBSTANCE THAT SPECIFICALLY ON HAND BRAIN FUNCTION IS IT ROUGH WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT WILL USE THEM PRIOR TO MORE CHALLENGING BOUTS OF TRAINING A THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WIPULL OUT SAY ON SPARRING DAY ONLY ORE THE MOST IMPORTANT TRAINING SESSION OR A SESSION WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK ON PITCH COMMAND OR WE ARE TRYING TO INHANDS A WORK ON YOUR SHOT AND AS A BAS SMALL PLAYER OR YOUE REALLY TRYING TO IMPROVE A CERTAIN SWING IS A CALL FIR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT WE DO NOT USE THEM EVERY DAY WE DO NOT USE H WITH EVERY PERSON SO YET WE WILL USE THOSE A THEY ARE NOT STIMULANTS BUT THEY CAN' BE PERFORMANCE ANHANCING AND ANOTHER CON A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU'RE IN THE CASE OF COLORIC RESTRICTION SO WHETHER YOU YOU'RE TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT OR WE'RE ACTURAC RON A CONTROL WEIGHT FOR WEIGT PURPOSES IN TERMS OF A SPORTS WE HAVE TO BE IN A CERTAIN WHITE CLASS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WETL WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU FOOD IN FACT WE MAY NOT BE ABL TO GET YOU STIMULANTS BECAUSE OF THE SLEEP THING OR BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY LIKE MAX ON A SIPULANCS A NOW WE CAN GO THIS ROUTMAN SO YOU LEAST LIKE MENTALLY YOU'RE LITLE BIT THERE AND YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE A LERT FOCUSED AND YOU CAN TRAIN HARDER DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE DN ACTUALLY CHANGE FU THON THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SHORT GAME IN TERMS OF THAT'S NOT YOUR PERMANENT SOLUTION YOU EVENTUALLY NEED TO BRING CALLORIES UP  WHATEVER OTHER TRAIN YOUR TRAINING WHATEVER GOING TO DO BUT IT CAN WORK IN A NICE SHORT PINCH I'M VERY INTERESTED TO LEARN FROM YOU ABOUT FATIGUE REDUCERS AND I'M HOPING THAT RODIOLA ROSAA WILL COME UP IN THE CONVERSATION YET GREAT LET'S JOSTAR RIGHT THERE THEN THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS DESPITE A MOST PEOPLE NOT HAVING HEARD OF IT AI BENG OF M ENTION O PREVIOUS EPISODE I'VE USED IT A LOT OVER MANY MANY YEARS YOU HAVE TO BE LUTOBITE CAREFUL OF A THERES WHE FIRST OF ALL NO WE ONLY SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS AT THE ONSET THE NO SUPPLEMEN IS HA PANACIA I NOTHINGS FON NO WORK FORRYNGAND RODI IS NO NO DIFFERENT IT CAN'T HAVE A NUMBER OF EFFECTS AIF YOU LOOK ACROSS E LITERATURE YOU CAN TO FIND GENERALLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A SMALL BENEFIT TO LITTLE BENEFIT BUT NOT OFTEN IS IT DETRIMENTAL WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS I KNOW OF A HANDFUL OF PAPERS THAT WOULD BE TO SPECIFICALLY WHERE IT MAY ACTUALLY REDUCE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE NO I FINE IF YOU THINK ABUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS THAT HAS BEEN SEEN SO FAR WITH RODIOLA IS IT IS HELPFUL AT MANAGING CORTISAL BUT CORTISALL SUPPRESSION IS NOT A NECESSARILY GOOD THING WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IF YOU DO IN ACUTE ABOUT ASTRESS CORTISALL WILL GO GOWAY UP AND THAT IS A SIGN OF OF ACUTE STRESS HOWEVER A SIGN OF LONG TERM AXCESSIVE STRESS IS CORTISALL SUPPRESSION AND SO THIS IS A THING TO BE REALLY CAREFUL OF YOU SEEF YOU'RE FEELING DOWN OR LETHARGIC OR TIRED AND YOU THINK YOU'RE ADRENAS WERE MESSED UP AND THE YU START TAKING CORTISAL MOGULATORS YOU COULD BE MAKING THE PROBLEM WORSE BECAUSE NOW YOUR CUORTISALLIS ACTUALLY SUPPRESSED AND NOW YOU'RE TAKING THESE THINGS TO BLUNTIT OR KEEP IT LOW AND AND YOUR YU CONTINUE TO FEEL AUTHARGIC AND AND LACK OF DESIRE AN LOBIDO AND FOCUS IN THE SORT OF ALL THE THING SO CORTISALL IS NOT A BAD THING WE WANT THIS TO BE GOING UP AND DOWN A ANY AMOUNTS AT WE WANT SO IF WE WERE FOR THINKING ABOUT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WAKING UP YOU WOULD WANT GENERALY SOMETHING LIKE A FIFTY PER CENT REDUCTION IN THE FIRST HOUR AND FROMS CORTISAL CONCENTRATIONS HOWEVER IF YOU'RE EXTREMELY SUPPRESSED ALREADY GOING DOWN IS IS ONLY GOING TO BE A PROBLEM SO RODIOLA IS IS HAS A A GOOD EVIDENCE BASE TO SUPPORT IT FOR THAT YOU'LL SEE ACTUALY A NUMBER OF OF STUDIES THAT IF LOOKED AT IT IN A WHOLE HOST OF ARIAS IM FOR BENEFIT SO SOMETHING GOOD TO DO A THE DIFFICULT PART WITH RODIOLA TO BE QUITE ON US IS GETTING IT FOR MY HIGH QUALITY BRAND AND SOR IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET AS A SINGLE SOURCE WHICH IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO WITH SUPPLEMENT TOS TRY TO GET THEM SOURCED ALONE I ROT YALL IT TIFFICALLY COMES IN COMBINATION WITH ANY OTHER URBLES OR OTHER STUFF A DRENO SUPPORT AND CETRA CETERA THAT ALSO THEN GETTING HIM THEN THIRD PARTY CERTIFIED WHICH FOR MOST FOLKS IS NOT NECESSARY BUT FOR ANY AT THETS TAT NEEG TO GO THROUGH DRUG TESTING SYSTEMS YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE ANY SUPPLEMENT AT ALL THAT DOES NOT HAVE SOME TH SORT OF THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION SO THOSE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT BEING SAID IF YOU'VE EVER RENTIN IT SOMEBODY WHO'S TAKEN RODIOLA AND LIKE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME IT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT'S YOUHAVE NOTHING WORSE FOREVERYONE IT ALSO COULD BE JUST VERY POOR QUALITY SOURCING SO IF YOU LOOK AT A THE THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF PAPERS ON IT'S PERCEPTION OF FATIGUE AND  USE SORT OF MENTION THAT YOU FELT PRETTY IMMEDIATE EFFECTS I'VE TAKEN IN A FEW TIMES YEI'M FAIRLY SENS TOTIVE SUPPLEMENTS BUT I'VE STARTED TAK IN A RODIOLA BE WORK WORK OUTS AND FOUND THAT I COULD PUSH MUCH HARDER MUCH LONGER THROUGH THE WORK OUT NORMALLY IUTD OR TYPICALLY BEFORE TAKING IT AM THAT IS IN SESSIONS WHERE I DID NOT TAKE IT I WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK O VERY HARD FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR SO THAN NEXT TEN MINUTES I COULD GET SOME WORK OUTPUT AND THEN THE REMAINING O PERIOD OF TIME IT WAS KIND OF A TAPERING OFF NOW GRANTED THESE ARE VERY INTENSE TRAINING SESSIONS THESE ARE NOT THE ENDURANCE TRAINING SESSIONS THESE OF THE WAY TRAINING SESSIONS THAT ONE ONE TIME POR WEEK PABODY PART TYPE SESSIONS AH WHAT I'VE NOTICES I CAN COMPLETE THE ENTIRE SIXTY MINUTES WITH WITH MINIMAL FATIGUE NOW IMAY OBVOUSLY I GET FATIGUES WITHIN SATSON OF COURSE YOU KNOW I YOU REMAIN HUMAN DUST BY TAKING IT BUT M I FOUND TO BE VERY USEFUL AND I'VE BEEN USING IT WHENEVER I USE ALPHAG P C PRIO PROR TO WORK OUTS AND I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED BY BY IT OVER ALL I DO ONT A HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID BECAUSE I THINK IT SO SO VITALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THAT USING SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS FOR MOST THINGS IS CRITICAL TO FIGURING OUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU WHAT DOES IN WHAT DOSAGES YOU NEED BEING ABLE TO TAKE THINGS A TWO ON ONE OFF IM TWO DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF FOR INSTANTS BEING ABLE TO A INCREASE DOSAGE IN THE MORNING AND THEN MAY BE REDUCED TO DOSES IN COMBINE WITH SOMETHING ELSE IN THE AFTERNOON SINGLEINGREDIENT FORMULATIONS OR MUCH THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT THERE'S PERHAPS ONLY ONE SUPPLEMENT THAT I TAKE AT ALL AND THAT'S ATHLETIC GREENS AS THER'VE BEEN A REGULAR POTCASPONSOR FOR A LONG TIME THAT IS A COCKTAL OF MANY MANY THINGS AND THOSE ARE ALL ADAPTAGENS AS WELL AS SON PROBIOTICS IN VITEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I'M NOT OPPOSED TO BLENDS WERE THE BLENDS INCLUDE A LOT OF NEUTRAANTS THAT ARE SINARGISTIC BUT FOR ALL PILL CAPSOL A BASED SUPPLEMENTS WHERE I'M LOOKING FOR VERY TARGETED OF FACTINIS NOT JUST ABOUT A FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION I REALLY BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS OF THE WAY THAT YOU CAN BUILD A RATIONAL APPROACH TO SOUMPLEMENTATION AND ALSO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IF SOMETHING IS IT MAKING YOU FEEL BETTER AND ALSO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS OF SOMETHING REALLY WORKING FOR SO FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT TAKE ALPHAG P C THREE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS AND NOT FEEL ANYTHING GO UP TO SIX HUNDRED MELEGRAMS NOT FEEL ANYTHING MAY BE JUST FEEL KIND OF A THEY DON'T LIKE IT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TOOK THREE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS OF ALPHAG P SE THE FIRST TIMES WHILE THIS REALLY PUTS ME IN THE ZONE BUT I WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL HOW OFTEN I USE IT I DID MENTION I GO UP TO SIXUNDER MILEGRAMS OCCASIONALLY BUT THAT REALLY PUTS ME ON THE OUTER THRESHOLD OF CAN OF OVER ALL LEVELS OF FOCUS AND AMPED UP SUCH THAT IF I DRINK TOO MUCH CAFFINAT CAN TELT ME OVER THE EDGE SO I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BECOME SCIENTISTS OF THEMSELVES AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO TRY T LIMIT THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES AND THE FINAL POINT IS THAT I THINK THAT SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS ARE BY FAR THE BEST IN TERMS OF CHANGING THINGS OVER TIME YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE A WA WOMEN DURING THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE MIGHT FIND THAT DURING CERTAIN PHASES OF THE CYCLE THEY'RE MORE SENSITIVE TO CERTAIN THINGS THAN NOT OTHERS AM AND FOR MEN AND WOMEN IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE CERTAIN TIMES OF YEAR EVEN AND A CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS MIGHT GO BETTER CLOSER TO SLEEP SOME EARLIER IN THE DAY EN ON AND ON AND ON THERE'S JUST NO REAL WAY IN MY OPINION TO HAVE A SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCAL THAT INVOLVES LOTS IN LOTS OF BLENDS ONE OR TWO BLENS O K BUT BLOTS OF BLENDS I THINK THAT'S A I SHALY THINK THAT'S DEPIDENTIALLY DANGEROUS TERRITORY YET I MEAN JUST TAKE RODIOLA AS GOD EXAMPLE I KNOW A A NEW METANALISIES CAME OUT A JUST IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS LOOKING AT IT AND THEY FOUND IN GENERAL YOU SEE AGAIN A SLIGHT TO MODERN IMPROVEMENT IND EVERYTHING FROM A POWER OUTPUT TO FATIGUE RESISTANT AND A OCCIDENT EFFECTS A TO INDUROUS PERFORMANCE SO IT'S LYKE OKET GRIT MAYBE THIS LITTLE BIT HERE NOW LET SAY YOU WENT TO DO IT IN THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD ACCES RODIOLA IS IN COMBINATION WITH THAT AND A SOME BLINDS MAN AND  SOME OTHER OF THESE ADAPTED INS FR A CYCHELL WAIT A MINUTE I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THS TO GET A BETTER WORK OUT BUT NOW IT ALSO CAME WITH THE STIMULANT OR THIS COROSOLL SUPPRESSOR OR CORSAL ACTIVATOR WELL NOW ALSO YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AT NIGHT OR YOU CAN'T TAKE IN THE MORNING CAUSE YOU'RE ORDY YOU'RE TO HEAD COFFEE YOUR YUROPTIONS ARES WAY LIMITED SO I THINK THE BIGGEST PART OF ALL THAT IF YOU IF SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL GOOD YOU HAVE ABSOLUTY NO IDEA YOU DON'T NOW IF ITLIS ROLIO YOU DO'T KNO IF IS THE BOSTUELLIAN IISANOR YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ANY THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE SMASHED IN THERE OR IT COULD BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THE A THE THE SITRIC ACID THEY USE LIKE SOME OTHER COMBINATION A THING AND NOW HERE YOU ARE THINKING THAT SOME SUPPLEMENT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR YOU DOESN'T AND YOU THROW THAT OUT OF YOUR REPERTOIS A FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WHICH IS YOUV NOT THE BIGGEST CRIME BUT IT'S NOT NEEDED AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO KNOW SO YET I FULLY STAMPED YOU CAN LOOK BACK AT MY COURSE LECTURES R LAST DECAD AND YOU WILL SEE LIKE STAMPED NUMBER ONE ON THE SUPPLEMENT LES SECTIONS IS MAKE SURE YOU'RE TAKING SINGLE INGRADIENT SUPPLEMENTS AT ALL COSTS THE LAST PART ABOUT THAT TOO IS YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO IN SURE THE AMOUNT THAT IS ON THE LABEL IS CORRECT SO IF YOU'RE TAKING RODIOLA AND IT SAYS UN ITS A HUNDRED MILEGRAMS IN THERE AND IF THAT'S ONLY THING LIT'S IN THERE YOU MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING CLOSE NOW THEY'RE NEVER PERFECT BUT WILL BE CLOSE IF IT'S IN A COMBINATION OF TWENTY OTHER THINGS YOU ACTUALLYU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA THAT'S IN THERE I IN FACT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PAPERS ON A MELATONEN AND VIT EM INDEE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER SUPPLEMENTS IN WHICH WHEN YOU ACTUALLYAS PULL HEM OFF THE SHELF THESE ARE THER STANDARD STUDIES WET THEY WOULD GOIN BY SAI LIKE TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENTS IN CASE OF MELETONEAN N WILL ACTUALLY MEASURE THE MOUNT OF MELETONA ACTUALLY IN THEM N DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE LABEL SAYS FIVE MILIGRAMS THEY CAN BE UP TO A FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSANDFOLD ACTUAL CONCENTRATION IN THAT SUPPLEMENT AND THEN YOU WONDER WHY SOME PEOPLE REACT GREAT MALTONE AN SOME PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY DESTROYS YOU AND THIS IS ALSO I LIKE W WILL ACTIOT WILL SEE THIS CONSTANTLY  PEOPLE WILL HAVE LIKE FIVE HUNDRED TIMES THE UPPER LIMIT A MELATONEN THE MORNING AFTER WHEN THE HALF LIFE IS SUPPOSED TO BE MORE LIKE NINETY MINUTES IT SHOULD BE TOTALLY GONE IVE OTWERE SEENG EXTREMELY I NON NOT EVEN TALKING LIKE DOUBLE I'M TALKING TEN TWENTY THIRTY ACTS THE UPPERA LIMIT RAIN FROR MELETONA THE NEXT MORNING AND AN AS LYCHLE AL WHAT YE TAKING IS I GOI GOT THIS MALATONAN AT EXSTORE OR EX WEBSID YOULIK WHOLLY COW IM SO I'M O'M NOT A POSED TO MELETONAN THEORETICALLY IM BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITHOUT ONE IN PARTICULAR SO ANY SUPPLEMENT HAS THAT TO BE TRUE SO YOU WANT TO BY THEM FROM AS MANY PLACES AS YOU CAN THAT OUR HIGH QUALITY AND IF THEY ARE A THIRD PARTY TESTED EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A PERFORMANCE ATHLETE I MUSTRESSES EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A PERFORMACE ATHLEY THIRD PARTY CERTIFIED AND TEST THE SUPPLEMENTS ARE YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO JUST JUST GET WILDLY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OR LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF ACT OF INGREDIENTS SO RELATIVE TO OTHER ONES WHON YOU MIGHT GET FOR KEEPER BUT YOU COULD BE TOTALLY RECKING YOURSELF BY GETTING YOU KNOW FIFTY MELEGRAMS OF MELETONA EVERY NIGHT AND NOT REALIZING IT SO THAT OF COURSE THE NEXT MORNING YOU DROWN YOURSELF IN KAFFINE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE WHAT DEATH CYCLE YOUR IN NOW YI AM PEOPLE COULD LOOK FORTH THEIR PARTY CERTIFICATION ON THE PACKAGING AND AM SOMEOE BSIDES WILL LIU OZUMIN ON THE BOTTLE BEFOREHAND I YOU IT'S LARGELY LISTED ON ON CERTAIN A VENDOR WEB SITES A BRIEF POINT ABOUT SUPPLEMENT COST AN BLENDS AN I PROMISES WILL BE A BRIEF POINT DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS MEANING DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS HAVE WIDELY VARYING COSTS IN ORDER TO YOU KNOW CRA TO I ON ENRTOMANUFACTURE THEM SO ALL TIS OGRATE YOU'LL FIND IS THAT BLENDS WELL AM INCLUDED THE LEAST AMOUNT OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE A INGREDIENT RIGHT AM NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THER SOME THEIR CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO THIS I MENTION SOME BLENDS THAT I LIKE A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT ARE FOR FOUNDATIONAL NATRITION ADAPTAGINS IN PROBIOTICS I LETTY GREANS OF WORSTIUS BEING ONE OF SEVERAL EXAMPLES OUT THERE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO  SAY A SLEEP BLEND OR A PREWORK OUT BLEND THERE ARE SOME DECENT PRODUCTS OUT THERE BUT A LOT OF THEM TEND TO PUT IN MORE OF THE LEAST EXPENSE OF INGREDIENTS AND LESS OF THE ONES THAT YOU'RE ACTIVELY SEEKING AND SO THOSE TEND TO BE A KAFFIINTENDS TO BE A KIND OF A BUFFER AGAINST THE OTHER THINGS MEANING IF YE PREWORK OUT PUTTING CAFFINE AN THERE ISN' NECESSARILY A BAD THING BUT IF HAS FIVE OTHER THINGS IN THERE OFTENTIMES WHAT MANUFACTURERS WILL CHEAT ON IS THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS OF THE THINGS THAT ARE COSTLY AM SO AGAIN SINGLYN GREDIENT FORMULATIONS FOR EIGHTY PER CENT OF YOUR SUPPLEMENTS THINK IS REALLY IM THE WAY TO GO AND THE OTHER THING THI KNOWS CAN COME UP AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE SUPPLEMENTS IS H ISSUE OF DEPENDENCY I OFTEN GET THIS QUESTION AND WHEN I SOLICIVE TO FOR QUESTIONS AON SOCIAL MEDIA IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS EPISODE NUMBER F PEOPLE SAID O CASE IF YOU'D TAKE A SLEEP FORMULATION DO I NEED TO TAKE IT EVERY NIGHT IF I DON'T TAKE IT WHILE I HAVE AN INCREDIBLY HARD TIME SLEEPING IF I TAKE A PREWORK OUT EVERY TIME I TRAIN WILL I WILL I NEED IT M ITS A GREAT QUESTION AM SOME PEOPLE WILL TAKE SUPPLEMENT HOLIDAYS AS THEY MAY BE CALLED A FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS EACH WEEK BACK TO BACK SOME PEOPLE TAKE THEM STRAIGHT THROUGH I MYSELF TAKE US ASLEEP COCKTAIL WE'VE DESCRIBED HIS MAGNESIUM THEANIAN AN THINGS THIS IS NOT ONE INGREDIENT THESE ARE MULTIPLE INGREDIENTS IN FACT PRECISELY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE SLEEP WALKING IN VIVID DREAM ASSUES CAN'T TAKE THE INION BEFORE BED IN ANY CASE I'VE HAD TIMES WHEN I EITHER FORGOT MY SUPPLEMENTS THAT'S RARE WHERE I JUST DIDN'T HAVE WHAT I NEEDED WERE JUST SIMPLY TOOK A BREAK FOR A NIGHT AND IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM UM BUT WEN TERMS OF PRE WORK OUT I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE BECOME DEPENDENT ON BEING IN THAT REALLY RAMPED UP STATE BUT I DON'T THINK WE VIEW ALL THIS AS LECE DRUDE DEPENDENCY I'M LIKE A DICTION TOT RIGHT I MEAN I DEFINE ADDICTION AS A PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE THINGS THAT BRING YOU PLEASURE SO YOU NLIKE I SUPPOSE PEOPLE COULD GET ADICTED TO PRE WORK OUT BUT IT SEEMS A LITTLE UNLIKELY MORE LIKELY THERE WOULD BE A DEPENDENCY SUCH THAT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR PREWORK OUT MIGHT FEEL LIE I NOT MONIVATED TO TRAIN SO WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON I'M TAKING LITTLE HOLIDAYS FROM SUPPLEMENTS AND VARYING FREQUENCY OF SUPPLEMENT IN TAKIN PARTICULAR AS IT RELATES TO STIMULANTS AND FATIGUE REDUCERS THE END GOAL ANY TIME I COACH SOMEBODY IS TO GET THEM INTO A PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE IN WHICH THEY REQUIRE NO OR CLOSE TO NO SUPPLEMENTATION THAT'S THE TARGET WE SHOULD REALLY BE ANY POSITION TO WHERE OUR LIFE STYLE OUR SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE OUR STRESS MANAGEMENT OUR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OUR SLEEP ON OUR HYDRATION AND OUR WHOLE FOOD NUTRITION PROVIDE US ALMOST EVERYTHING WE NEED NOW LOOK AGAIN THERE ARE SOME FOUNDATIONAL ITEMS THAT WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE WEV PUT TO GET A LITTLE BUNDLE ACTUALLY FOR THIS A BASIC THINGS EVEN GO LOOK OUT BUT THE THAT'S THE GOLD RIGHT SO THE TARGET IS TO BE TET YOUR PHYSIOLOGY RUNTING YOUR PHYSIOLOGY IS WAY SMARTER THEN WE ARE EVEN IF I TAKE A BUNCH OF BILE MARKERS FROM YOU YOU PHYSIOLOGY STILL KNOWS BETTER THAN THOSE FEW MARKERS CAN TELL ME SO THAT'S ALWAYS WERE ENDING UP I ACTUALLY PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE PEOPLE BEING IN A POSITION THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE A SUPPLEMENT FOR ANYTHING SO I DON'T LIKE IT IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SUPPLEMENT TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT ASLEEP I DON'T LIKE IT IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SUPPLEMENT TO TRAIN WE WILL USE ANY THE STIMULANTS VERY VERY CAREFULLY WITH ANY THE ATHICS WE WORK WITH AND CERTAINLY FOR THE NON ATHLES BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY ANTHINS WE HAVE AN ENDATE WE HAVE A FIGHT SCHEDRIL WE HAVE A SEASON WE HAVE A GAMEYOUR EN A PITCH WHATEVER WEN YOU DON'T HAVE THAT IT'S SORT OF LIKE YOU IN THIS ENDLESS PSYCLEIF OH YOU US GOING TO DO THAT ALL DAY EVERY DAY WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO BE IN THAT SPOT SO WHAT I THE WAY THAT I DESCRIBE MY PHILOSOPHY IS I WILL USE THOSE SHORT TERM TACTICS TOO SIMPTOM MANAGE IF I HAVE TO SO IF SOMEBODY COMES TO ME AND LIKE YOUR FEELING AWFUL AND WE'VE GOT I GET THROUGH THEOO GET GRET MAYBE WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR SLEEP IMMEDIATELY TO GET YOU SLEEPING THAT ALLOWS US TO THEN COME BACK AND WORK ON THE CAUSLE PROBLEM RIGHT SO THIS IS WHAT IS WHY ARE YOU HAVING A HARDTIME SLEEPING ANYWAYS IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE A A NINE COCKTAIL SUPPLEMENT TO SLEEP THEN ALL WE'RE DOING IS IS BLINDING THE REASON WHY YOU IN THAT POSITION TO BEGIN WITH RIGHT SO WE SEE THIS ALL THE TIME WHETHER IT IS SLEEP PROBLEMS WHETHER TDIS CORTIS ALL AT TISTOSTRON THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THAT LOW NOW WE MAY GIVE YOU SOMETHNG AGEN TO MANAGE IT IMMEDIATELY BUT THE TASK ATHTHE MYSTERY I'M GOING TO TRY TO UNVEIL IS WHY WHY IS IT THERE TO BEGIN WITH THIS COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS NATURAL FOR YOU AND YOUR LACK OF ENERGY IS SOMETHING ELSE OR COULD BE ACTUALLY IT IS NOT A NATURAL LEVEL FOR YOU BUT SOMETHING IS SUPPRESSING IT ANY NUMBER OF YOU'VE GOT' SOME INFACTION GOING ON THEREIS SOME I WL LERGEI C REACTION IS SOMETHING IN YOUR ENVIRONMEN THEREIS O YOU A MOULD A MERCURY LIKE THAT ONE COMES UP A LOT YOU'LL SEE MERCURY IN FOLKS AN THAT'S CAUSING A LOT OF PROBLEMS IM OR ANY NUMBER OF HEAVY MEALS OR TOXSONS I ANY HOST OTHING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS BAD DAILY HABIT YOU DON'T EVER SEE THE SUN LIKE YOU DO'T EVER SWEAT YOU DON'T NEVER DRINK WESE TALK ABOUT SO MANY THINGS SO I'M ALWAYS GOING TO HUNT FOR THAT AN I HATE USING THIS PHRASE IT'S HIGHLY MALIGNED FOR A GOOD REASON BUT ROUTE CAUSE RIN SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT ITS LIKE ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT CAUSING THIS PROBLEM AND I'M NOT GOING TO WANT TO GIVE YOU A SUPPLEMENT TO COVER UP SOMETHING IF WE'RE NOT EVEN TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF WHITST BING THERE THAT BEING SAID AN I THAT CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE TAKING AN MULTI VITEMEN JUST ALL THR NO NOT REALLY AN MI CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE TAKING GREATING NO LIKE GO AHEAD THO THOSE ONES ARE GENERALLY AR PRETTY FINE TO TO JUST TAKE BUT ANYTHING ELSE I WANT A REASON I REALLY DON'T LIKE GIVING PEOPLE ANYTHING IN A SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL CONCENTRATION ORE A SUPER FOOD CONCENTRATION RIGHT SO AGET AN AMOUNT YOU WOULDN'T FIND IN A NORMAL FOOD DOSAGE UNLESS WE HAVE REALLY A SPECIFIC REASON SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE MORE PROBLEMATIC OTHERS ARE LESS PROBLEMATIC SO WHEN AN ANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCY YOU HAVE A COMBINATION OF ACTUAL PHYSIOLOGICAL DEPENDENCY CAFINE LIKE THAT ACTUALLY CREATES A PHYSIOLOGICAL DFINNECY VERSIS A AN MOTIONAL ORE PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPENDENCY OR JUST A I LIKE DRINKING THIS LIKE THAT'S MY HABIT THAT'S MY ROUTINE THERE'S A FANCY SCIENTIFIC CRAZE FOR THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MATTE SO YET WE WANT TO GET OFF THAT AND LIKE AGAIN MY PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY IS I DON'T WANT YOU TDEPENDENT UPON ANYTHING I WANT TO CREATE EXTREMELY RESILIENT PEOPLE AND I WANT TO CREATE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESILIENTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FANCY LITTLE AUGAR THAN WE USE TO TO MEASURE THAT IN PEOPLE AND S WE CAN ACTUALLY CALCULATE THAT NUMBER AND THE GOAL OF US IS TO PUSH THAT NUMBER HIGHER SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANYTHING I'M SO MANY SITUATIONS POP UP IN YOUR REAL LIFE YOU'RE NOT CAN HAVE YOUR SUPPLEMENT OR YOUR NO CAN HAVE YOUR ROUTINE OR OU NO CAN HAVE YOUR JOURNAL OR WHATEVER BUT ALSO FOR THE LONG TERM I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SITUATION WHICH THIS IS A SHORT TRM SUCCESS THAT YOU HAVE TO NOW DO THAT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE NO LET'S US GET OUT OF THE WAY THAT'S FIX THE PROBLEM IF IF THERE IS SOMETHING SIME TO MANAGEMENT THAT'S REAL WHILE WE'RE ACTUALLY SEARCHING FOR BETTER FOUNDATIONAL HABITS I'M THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU'RE ONLY COVERING SYMPTEM YOU'RE REALLY MISSING SIGNAL IWHICHIS IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TIRED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND AL LE YOUR DOING IS GIVING YOURSELF A A NUMBER OF ALPHIG P SEES AND KAFFINS SETH AR EVEN OTHERS GOOD LITESOGER ARE YOU REALLY DISUSING THAT TO ALLOW YOUR POOR SLEE HYGIN TO HAPEN IF YTHEY TOOK THOSE AWAY I BETH YOU YOU WOULD ACTUALLY TART ADDRESSING YOUR SLEEP IF THAT'S THE CAUSE RIGHT RIGHT YOUR INTEREST SIR WOU'RE PORIDRATION LIKE YOU WOULD GO HUNTING FOR THE PROBLEM AND SO TH YOU WANT WALKE A FINE LINE HERE GOING LIKE HAYLOCK IS AN ATHETIC GREENS SUPPLEMENT THAT BINOW PROBABLY NOT BUT WAIT AMN AM I ACTUALLY NOW COVERING UP THE PAIN POINT THAT IS MAYBE NEEDED IT'S THE SIGNAL TO ACTUALLY GET MY ASS AND GEAR TO GO MAKE ONE OF THESE CHANGES AM WHATEVER IT IES TO BE SO I KNOW I TIT LIKE A LITTLE BIT META ON YOU A LITTLE BEO OFF GI THAT'S HONESTLY HOW I APPROACHT YET I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT A FRIEND OF MIND WHOSE A PHYSICION HAS A GREAT SAYING UM WHICH IS BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY STILL REQUIRES BETTER LIVING UM BEL THAT'S COD THAT'S SO YOU KNWING IT PERTAINS ALSO TO THINGS LIKE AND TO DEPRESS ANDS AND GHTY HT DRUGS AND THINGS THAT SORT MOST ALL OF THOSE THINGS WERE DEVELOPED AS TOOLS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE FROM AY A MALADAPTIVE STATE A MALADAPTIVE IS HARD TO DEFINE BUT THINK ABOUT IN ANY DOMAIN OF LIFE YOU CAN EITHER BE BACK ON YOUR HEELS FLATFOOTED OR FORWARD CENTER OF MASS UM AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE SO COMPROMISED NOR CHEMICALLY THAT THEY NEED TO USE FARM ACOLOGY IN ORDER TO GET INTO A FLATFOOTED POSITION ON THERE REALLY BACK ON THEIR HEELS FLATFOOTED OR FORWARD CENTER MASS BUT THE IDEA WAS ALWAYS THAT THOSE THINGS WERE DEVELOPED AS THINGS TO ALLOW PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS THAT CAN PRODUCE THE SAME SORTS OF NEROCHEMICAL SHIFTS AND THE PEOPLE ARE THING WELL WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIORS CAN INDUCE SEASON OR CHEMICAL SHIFS I'LL JUST ZUME OUT MYSELF FOR A MOMENT HERE AND SAY I AM A BIG PROPONENG I BELIEVE YOU ARE AS WELL IF I MAY IN DOING BEHAVIOURAL TOOLS FIRST WHENEVER POSSIBLE REALLY ESTABLISHING GOOD HABITS THE DUS AND DON'TS SHEU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IN THIS SERIES AND IN THIS EPISODE THEN EXCELLENT NUTRICION WHICH INVOLVES DUS AND DONTS VOLUME FROD CHOICE TIMING ALL THE FACTORS AND THEND ALSO SUPPLEMENTATION AND ALSO THERE SOMETIMES A CASE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CERTAINLY AND OFTEN BRIN MACHINE INTERFACE OR BODY MACHINE INTERFACE MEASURING STUFF USING DEVICES BUT TI THE FOUNDATION OF BEHAVIORS AND GOOD NUTRICION ARE REALLY TRULY FOUNDATIONAL AND IT'S HARD IN ANYTHING TO SKIP STEPS BUT SUPPLEMENTS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE ONE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE OFTEN SKIP STEPS AND THEN THIT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY LEARN HOW TO CULTIVATE THE BEST A BEHAVOURAL PRACTICES INCLUDING THE DON'T AS YOU MENTION AND THEN JUST ONE MORE POINT ALONG THESE LINES YOU KNOW YOU TALKES ABOUT TAKING ANYTHING FOR ENERGY IS REALLY A DESRUPTIVE TO THE SYSTEM AND IT IS BECAUSE ESPECIALLY KAFFINE WHILE IT HAS ITS USES AND EVEN HEALTH BENEFITS IT'S TRUALY BORROWING IIT'S AGAINST THE ADENIZINE SYSTEM WITH INTEREST AND SO BECAUSE CAFFINE ACTS AS IN A DENAZINE ANTAGONISTS EFFECTIVELY WHILE KAFFINE IS PRESENT IN THOSE RECEPTORS YOU DON'T FEEL A SLEEPY YOU HAVE MORE ENERGY YOUR WE REACTION TIME GOES DOWN MEMORIES HANDS FOLK AS PERFORMANCE OF ALL KINDS YES BUT THEN WHEN THAT KAFFINE IS DISLODGED FROM THE RECEPTOR THEN THE ADENIZINE CAN ACT EVEN MORE POTENTLY AT THOSE RECEPTORS SO SORT OF LIKE BEING ABLE TO BORROW AGAINST THE NORMAL VARIATIONS AND WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP AND THIS IS WHY WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IF THEY'RE NOT TRAINING FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO PUSH THEIR CAFINE AND TAKE OUT ABOUT NINE ETO HUNDRED TWENTY MENTHS AFTER WE CING SO THEY CAN CLEAR SOME OF THAT A DENAZINE IN THE MORNING WHICH TENDS TO HAPPEN EVEN A AFTER WE WAKE UP U PEOPLE CAN LISTEN TO EPISODES ON MASTER SLEEP OR PERFECT SLEEP OR THE CAFINE EPISODE TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THAT BUT THE THE FINAL THING I JUST WANT TO SAY HERE THAN IT IT AMPROMPTS A QUESTION IS YOU KN EEN THINKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENT PROTOCALLS UM I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME THAT ONCE THEY START TAKING SOMETHING THEY'RE GOINGTO HAVE TO TAKE IT ALL THE TIME AND ONE IDEA PERHAPS IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SOME A ALPHAG P C AROUND THAT THEY COULD TAKE AND GRANTED BE GREAT IF PEOPLE COULD TRY THINGS WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A WHOLE PRODUCT I THINK COMPANIES HOPEFULLY OR LISTENING TO THIS AND WILL I'M GIVE PEOPLE SAMPLE TO SEE IF SOMETHING WORKS FOR THEM AND THEN GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY O TRY IT TO HAVE THINGS AROUND BUT NOT NECESSARILY ASSUMINGYOU INTO TAKE IT EVERY TIME RIGHT SOME THINGS YOU TAKE EVERYDAY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION UM A SUPPLEMENTS FOR INSTANCE BUT THEN ALSO TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WELL YOU'RE EATING OR NOT EATING RIGHT AT TIMES WHEN I'M EATING MUCH BETTER I CONSUMING YOU KNOW THOS SUGAR FERMENTED FOODS WHICH ARE GREAT FOR THE GOT MICROBIUM I CAN SUN LESS PROBIOTICS IF EVER I'VE BEEN REALLY COMPROMISED FOR WHATEVER REASON THEN I WILL TAKE PILLFORM PROBIOTICS BUT DONL TAKE THOSE ALL THE TIME IM BECAUSE I GET THEM FROM FOODIN FROM CERTAIN GREEP YONG GREEN STRINGS LIKE ATHOLETIC GREENS AND SO FORTH SO I THINK THAT NUTRITIAN AND SUPPLEMENTATION ARE ARE TETHERED IN THIS WAY IN MY MIND AND I DON'T THINK THAT I'M MOST PEOPLE THINK OF SUPPLEMENTATION IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN INTRDUCE SA LOT OF ARYABILITY AND WHEN AND HOW YOU TAKE THEM BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AS ALLS ARE SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS YOU CAN BE I'M YOU CAN U SUPPLEMENTS ONCE A WEEK ON WANT YOU USE HEM SEVEN DAYS A WEEK YOU COULD USE THEM I'M TWICE TO DAY FOUR TIMES A DAY EVERYDAY OR YOU COULD USE THEM NOT AT ALL AGREED YEH SOME OF EM A WE'LL HAVE AN EFFECT RANDILY LIKE THAT OTHERS WILL NOT AND WE TALKED ABOUT CREETING BEING ONE OF THEM ITS IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AT ONCE OR SO WEEK THAN THERS I MA BASE IT NO BETTEFIT THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT VERY OU CREATINGS IM BATE A ALLENI IS ANOTHER FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING YOU NEED TO TAKE CONSISTENTLY IF YOU WANT SOME SORT OF BENEFIT A IT NEEDS TO BE BUILT UP IN MUSCLE WHEN NEED TO USE THAT TO CREATE A CARNESSIN WHICH IS WHAT'S ACTIONCAN HELP US WITH OUR FATIGUE MANAGEMENT THAT'S WHY WE COME UP LIKE CAN ASSAT BUFFER I'M SO IN OUR PREVIOUS METAPOLISAM UPSO WE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEING A MAJOR CAUSE OF FATIGUE I'M THE WONDERFUL PART THE REMWHILE RIES IS WY BADE ALLENN WORK SO EFFECTIVELY IS IT BLOCKS THAT BUILD UP SO THAT IS A  EXAMPLE OF ANOTHE WON YOU WOULD WANT TO TAKE OTHER THINGS LIKE FISH OIL YOU COULD CERTAINLY SKIP A DAY HERE AND THERE IT WOULDN'T BE THAT BIDEAL I ALSO DO SUPPORT YOUR COMMENT IF YOU CAN TAKE ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THESE THINGS AND AND BE JUST FINE I IN TERMS OF AND I WON'T COME BACK MAY BE TO BAT ALLEY A SECOND IN TERMS TO HAVE SOME OTHER FUNDS TOFF MIGH COLLE GREGA SIKY RAN A REALLY COOL NUMBER OF STUDIES LOOKING AT HOW EXERCISE ACTUALLY ALTERS THAT GOT MICROBYON THIS IS ACTIAN AREA THAT WE I'VE PROBABLY HAVE THREE HUNDRED STOOL SAMPLES SITTING IN MY FREE'SE ROOM I  GOODNESS AFNOTHER REASON TO PAUSE BEFORE ENTERING YOUR LAB YE ANOTHER REASON TO NOT APPLYING TO COME BE ONE OF MY GRADUATE LES YOU WON TO DO IT THAT I L ACT HO HAVE A NUMBER WE'VE APPLIED FOR A COUPLE OF GRANTS TO LOOK MORENIS A SPECIFICALY WITH FEMALES ISO HOPE FUL EVEN GET THAT FUNDED BUT NONTHELESS I YOU CANNOCT SHE SEES TOME I PERTY FROM MATIC AND I SAY THAT WORD ON PURPOSE CHANGES IN THE GOT MICR O BYM THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR STUDY OAS THINKING OF THAT GREAT DID IS HE LOOKED AT THA THE CHANGES PREPOST AN ALTR MARATHON IN EVEN WITHIN A SINGLE BOUT OF EXERCISE I I CAN REA THE SOMEBOTHY MARKERS BUT I KNOW ONE OF THE MARKERS I WAS SPECIFICALLY INCREASED BY LIKE FOURTEEN THOUSAND PER CENT AFTER A SINGLE BOUT OF EXERCISE NOW THIS IS AN MOSTRO MARATHON THIS IS LIKE I TOTALLY ABSURD AMOUNT OF EXERCISE RELATIVE TO A NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD DO WOULD BE BUT THAT NUMBER I REMEMBER LIKE IT WAS LIKE FOURTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE PER CENTER LIKE SOMETHING SOME RAN ON HM O LIKE THAT OF SOMETHING MEANING FUL YES SOMETHING MEAN IF LIK CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH MARKER I THAT WAS THAT AD CHANGED A I NOW STRUPT A COCCAS WAS IN THERE STRUPP A COCCAS WENT UP K MAYBE SOMETHING MORE LIKE THIRTY OR FORTY OR FIFTY PERCENTS THE POINT IS WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD THE PROPER TIME AND WE DON'T TO EVEN LAUNCH IN THE GO MICROF BYON IM SUPPLEMENTATION THERE NEEDS TO BE ULTRA SPECIFIC I YOU WOULDN'T BE BEST SERVED TO JUST JUMP IN AND TAKE RANDOM THINGS THERE THAT'S IT'S A WHOLE AREA OF EMERGING SCIENCE WE KNOW VERY VERY VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT BUT THERE IS A NUMBER OF ACTIONABLE THINGS ONE COULD DO I THERE SO PROBABLY SOMETHING TO NOT MESS WITH I WOULD CERTAINLY WORK WITH A QUALIFIED PHYSICIAN IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE SOMETHING GOING ON CLINICAL ER YOU HAVE SOME ACTUAL PROBLEM THERE DON'T WORK WITH SOME ONE IS NOT A SPECIALIST I MECODOC THERE BUT IM JUST RANDOMLY ASSIGNING MUCH OF PROBIOTICS OR PREE BIOTICS WITHOUT INTENTION IS IS MAY BE  THE NEXT FOR FRONT OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE RESEARCH BUT WELL HAVE TO ME BE COME BACK IN A FEW YEARS AND IVEN THAT IN DETAIL HER PERHAPS SYOU CAN BRING SOMEBODY OUT AS AN EXPERT IN THAT TO DISCUSS THAT YET GOT MICR BYOM IS FASCINATING I THINK OF SLEEP AS THE MOST POWERFUL PERFORMANCE ENHANCING ACTIVITY A OF COURSE YOU STILL HAVE TO DO THE ACTIVITY YE IYE CONSIDERAT FOUNDATIONL IKE THE BUSY WORK RAISES THE TIDE OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH PERFORMANCE OF ALL KINDS AM THERE'S RECENT DATA THAT DURING SLEEP YOUR BODY GOES THROUGH ALL ITS VARIOUS FORMS OF METABOLISM POSSIBLE YE THET WHICH IS A MA AZING SOS MEASURED FROM BREATH IN HUMAN SUBJECTS AT BREATHMATABOLITES IN HUMAN SUBJECTS SO OBVIOUSLY A IF ONE IS THINKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION AND WONDERING O KERE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE BEST SUPPLEMENT TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE YOU GAVE SOME A GREAT RATIONAL FOR WHY CREATINE WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHOICE PROVIDED YOUR EATING WELL AND A HYDRATING WELL AND THEN TO MY MIND THE NEXT THING ON THE LEST WOULD BE ANYTHING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND MAYBE EVEN THE DURATION OF YOUR SLEEP ALTHOUGH IF YOUR WAKE UP IN YOUR FEEL RESTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND ONLY NEED A SHORT NAP IN THE AFTERNOON NOT EVERYONE NEEDS ONE BUT THEN GENERALLY THAT MEANS YOUR FEELING OC PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET FLIPPED ON TO THIS IDEA THAT THEY HAVE INSOMNIA IN SOMNIA IS EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINES WER YOU'RE FALLING ASLEEP DURING THE DAY THAT'S INSOMNIA COULD ALSO BE NARCOLEPSY BUT THAT'S INSOMNIA BUT SUPPLEMENTATION TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OR DURATION OF SLEEP WOR BOTH SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE A MOST DIRECT ROUT EVEN THOUGH ACTUALLY TECHNICALLY ITS AN INDIRECT ROUT TO A PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT AND THEN THINKING ABOUT THINGS THAT INCREASE ALERTNESS AND STIMULANTS AND FIT AND FATIGUE RODUCERS YOUTHING THAT'S A GOOD LOGIC YE WE GO TO ABSURD LIGHTS TO DILE SLEEP IN AS MUCH AS WE CAN AVN THE HONEST ANSWER IS LIKE TRULY ABSURD THIS IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT MIGHT MY COMPANY I'M APART AS ABSOLUTE REST IS IT Y IN THAT COMPANY WE ACTUALLY GO OUT TO YOUR HOUSE AND RUN A FULL CLINICAL GRADE SLEEP STUDY IN YOU YOUR BEDROOM ON YOU RUN THAT OEREMULTIPLE NIGHTS SO THER O HAVING TO GO TO A SLEEP CLINEC AND AND HAVE IT DONE IN THIS WEARD HOSPITAL ROOM OR SORT OF SETTING WITH THIS PEOPLE LOOKING AT YOU THROUGH A MER IT'S LIKE TOLICREEPY A THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY DETERMINE HOW YOU ARE SLEEPING NOW THAT'S SAID THE TECHNOLOGY OF WEARABLE TRACERS IS GETTING BETTER IN FACT I WOULD ACTUALLY PREDICT THOSE THINGS WILL REACH A LEVEL OF ACCURACY EQUIVALENT TO THE PIESTY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND PROBABLY WIOL GET AFTE A APPROVAL TO BE ABLE TO DAG NO SUFFICIENTLY SLEEP DISORDERS  THAT'S MY TOTAL MY MY PREDICTION FROM SOME INS ID FORMATION I DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE BUT IT IS GETTING A LOT BETTER RIGHT NOW THOSE WEARABLES ARE NOT ACCUR ENOUGH TO MEET THAT THRESHOLD SO THAT WE DO IS WE BRING OUT BASELY ALL THE EQUIPMENT I TO DO THAT SO WE'LL COME IN AND DO THAT NOW ONCE WE UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW YOU ARE SLEEPING THE NEXT QUESTION IS TO ANSWER WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING THAT WAY AND SO THIS IS A FULL FOURFOLD SYSTEM A NUMBER ONE IS WRONG TO LOOK AT BIOLOGY WHAT TRANG'S GOING TO TAKE SALIVA AND BLOOD AND WE'ELOOKING AT EVERYTHING FROM A NARROW TRANSMITTERS CONCENTRATIONS TO A VITEMENTS BE SIXS BE TWELVE AT CETERA THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR SLEEP PERFORMANCE SO RUN TO SEE IS THAT IT ISNAT A PHYSIOLOGICAL PROBLEM IS THERE SOMETHING HAPPENER IS CORT US ALL TE TIE RATIO THAT WE PREVIOUSY TALKED ABOUT OR IS SOMETHNG LIKE THAT OFF IF IT'S NOT PHYSIOLOGY THEY WERE GOING ON THE NEXT ONE WHICH IS ENVIRONMENTAL WE RE UN A FULL ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN OF YOUR BEDROOM DURING THOSE NIGHTS OF SLEEP THAT WERE THERE AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK AT EVERYTHING FROM DANDER AND PALLEN AND ALORDONS HAT ARE IN THE AIR A HAT QUICK TIP HERE IS WASH YOUR SHEETS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEP ONE OF THE COMMON MOST COMMON PLACES THAT PEOPLE IM GET ALLOGINS IN THE AIR IS ACTUALLY FROM ACCUMULATION ON YOUR SHEETS SO IF YOU CLEAN THOSE MORE OFTEN I YOU'LL BE IN A BETTER SPOT AN NEXT ONE THE NEXT ONE THERE ALSO IS THAT KEEP YOUR I'M SORRY THIS HURTS MY HEART I DON'T EVEN BY I IND IN TRUTH FULNESS I VIOLATE THIS BUT KEEP YOUR PETS OUT OF YOUR BEDROOM N CERTAINLY KEEP THEM OFF YOUR BED OUR OUR GHOSTFACE KILLER IS MY DOG AND MELKKEES MY OTHER ONE THEY DON'T GO ON MY BED BUT THEYARE RIGHT NEXT MY BED I' SO WE VIOLANTE THAT ONE BUT FULL AN VIRON MOUTSGAN INCLUDES ALL THOSE THINGS OF COURSE THERE IS  WE MEASURE LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE AN HUMIDITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING ON THE ROOM AM VOLLID ORGANICS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE MATRESS FROM MOLL THE HIDE LEAD OUT O OUT OF THE WALL LIKE ALL THESE THINGS THAT COULD POTENTIALLEE JUST RUPTURE SLEEP AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE KICKING ON A WE SEE THIS CONSTANTLY PEOPLE WILL HAVE THINGS LIKE TRYING TO BE COOL AND THEY WANT TO BE COLD AT NIGHT CAUSE AT'S IMPORTANT AND SO THE'LL TURN AIR CONNITIONER N HONOR OF FAN BUT THEY AIR CONISTIOR KICKING ON AND OFF A NIGHT ACTUALLY CAN CEUTH YOU OUT OF VARYOUS SLEEP STATIOUS SO YOU WANT O BE REALLY CAREFUL THAT I'S GOING THE LAST MECTRIC ON THAT IS ACTUALLY SEAL TO AND SO WHAT YOU REMEMBER FROM OUR METABOLISM DISCUSSION IS WHEN YOU EXHAIL YOUREBREATHING OUT SEAL TOO WELL IF YOUR ROOM IS CLOSED AND THE VENTILATION ISN'T GREAT THE AMOUNT OF SE TWO IN YOUR ROOM STARTS TO BUILD UP AND WE ACTUALLY VERY SPECIFICALLY NO THE THRESHOLD A BASTE ONE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THE NNATUONAL SPACESTACTION ACTUALLY WE KNOW THE THRESHOLD OF WHICH SEAL TWO CROSSES AND STARTS INDISTRUPTING SLEEP SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OU'RE NOT SITTING IN THI SEAL TWO BATH IN FRONTING YOUR FACE AND THEN BREATHING ABACK IN AND INDISTRUPTING YOUR SLEEP SO ENVIRONMENT IS THE SECO ONE THE THIRD ONE HIS ACTUALLY NOW PSYCHOLOGY SO A ONET OF THE MEMBERS ON OUR TEAM IS AF HARVARD EMPTY AND PSYCHIATRY AN AND PUT TOGETHER N ENTIRE SLEEP SCAN A SURVEY SO WE RUN THROUGH ALL THAT TO SE IF THERE'S ANXIETY DEPRESSION ANYTHING LIKE THAT PSYCHOLOGICALY GOING ON AND IN THE FIRTH FOURTH ONE THERE IS IF YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF ACTUAL SLEEP PATHOLOGY AND SO THIS AGAIN WELL INCLUDE SOME I TRACKING STUFF THAT WE CAN USE SO WE TAKE ALL THOSE DATA THEY GO BACK TO OUR TEAM A WE WORK IN COMMINATION WITH WITH STEEP LOCKY A FROM HARVAR WHO'S DONE A TONE A STUFF YE ACTUU SET UP A LOT OF THE CIRCADIAN RHTHMSTUFF IN THE NATUAL SPACESTATION AS WELL I HIMSELF JEVERY DURMORAN EMPTY PH D ET CETERA AND ALL THESE FOLKS IN A ROOM GO OVER YOUR DATA IDENTIFY WHAT'S GOING ON THEN TO BUILD ACTION PLANS OFF O THAT OCCASIONALLY THOSE ACTION PLANS WI INCLUE SUPPLEMENTATION BUT ONLY IF NECESSARY WERE REALLY GOING TO TRY TO COME BACK AND WORK THROUGH A SYSTEM IM TO IMPROVE THE SLEEP HOWEVER IS NED SO I REALIZE THAT IS NOT A TOTALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT LIKE IF YOU REALLY NEED TO GO TO THE END OF THE EARTH TO FIGURED OUT SLEEP IM THAT SERVICE IS AVAILABLE ABSOLUTE REST SOUNDS LIKE AN AMAZING TOOL GIVEN THET MOST PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO USE IT AM WER ACCESS IT ALTHOUGH WE WILL PROVIDE A LINKING CASE PEOPLE OR INTERESTED IN IT AND DO WANT TO TRY IT YOU MENTION A FEW THINGS THAT I THINK EVERY ONE SHOULD A ASSAY THEIR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT FOR AND I'M DETERMINED WHETHER NOT THEY ARE HINDERING THEIR SLEEP A WITHOUT REALIZING IT FOR INSTANCE THE A AIR CONDITION IN GOING ON AND OFF OR THIS COULD BE HEATER GOING ON AND OFF OR I'M CENTRAL HEAT HEATING OR COOLING UNIT IM THIS COULD BE I KEEPING THE ROOM DARK A THIS COULD BE A CLEANING YOUR SHEETS I CERTAINLY THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE A A THAT ONE SEND OUT FOR ABSOLUTE AS SO CLEANING ONE SHEETS ROUTINELY KEEPING PATS OUT OF THE BEDROOM AS A YOU'D ADMITTED YOU DON'T ENTIRELY IM DIFFERING OPINIONS ABOUT THAT BUT IF YOURE HAVING SLEEP ISSUES THE DANDER FOR ANIMALS MAY MAY BE PART OF THOSE ISSUES AND THEN ONE THAT I'LL JUST ADD WHICH I THINK IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING IS T THERE SOME BEAUTIFUL DATA OUT OF MICHAEL TERMINS LAB AT A COLUMBIA MEDICAEL SCHOOL IN NEW YORK I'M O NEGATIVE IRONIZATION AND THE SOUNDS PRETTY A WACKY  KIND OF NEW AG  I'M SURE SOME YOURLI  NEGATIVE IRONIZATION BUT TIS IN THE TERMIN LAB AS A SERIOUS LABORATORY FOCUS ON CIRCATING BIOLOGY FOR MANY DECADES NOW NEGATIVE I ON CONCENTRATIONS ARE HIGRER N YEAR COASTOL LOCATIONS WS IF YOU'VE EVER GONE TO THE SEA OR GONE ON VACATION AND YOU SLEEP BETTER NEAR ABODY OF WATER THAT'S ACTUALLY A REAL THING AND THERE ARE NEGATIVE IRONIZATION MACHINES BUT THERE ALSO SOMETHINGS THAT ONE CAN DO IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE NEGATIVE ION CONCENTRATION IN THEIR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE A  NEARLY'S ERO COST IF NOT ZERO COST YOU CAN LOOK THOSE UP ON LINE AND WE PROBABLY WILL DO IN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT THIS IN THE FUTURE BUT I THINK WHAT YOU DESCRIBE FOR ABSOLUTE REST REALLY HIGHLIGHTS OF MORE GENERAL SET OF THEMES THAT I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS YOU'R SLEEP ENVIRONMENT IS AN ENVIRONMENT IT'S GOT A LOT GOING ON IN IT AND IT'S WORTH RUNNING THROUGH THE CHECK LIST  THAT YOU DESCRIBED IN ASKING YOU KNON'T WERE WER THINGS YOU KNOW MAY BE NOT OPTIMIZE BUT WHERE MY REALLY GETTING IN MY OWN WAY IN TERMS OF SLEEP ALL OF THIS AGAIN BEING RELATE TO THE FACT THAT GETTING AXCELLENT SLEEP CONSISTENTLY IS AT CCOML COMPLETELY TRANSFORM EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO AND NOT GETTING EXCELLENT SLEEP CONSISTENTLY WHCH IS A CHALLENGE FOR SO SO MANY PEOPLE I WILL ALSO TRANSFORM EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO AND THINK AND FEEL BUT IN THE NEGATIVE DIRECT YET I CAN ALSO OFFER A FEW TIPS AON SLEEP BASED ON THINGS WE FIND MOST CONSISTENTLY FOR THOSE THAT NO CAN'T GO THROUGH A THE HOPROTOCOL I'M ONE QUICK LITTLE ACTUALLY AP CALLED TIME SHIFTER IS REALLY COOL FOR ANYONE THAT'S DEALING WITH CONSISTENT TRAVEL AND GENTLAC SO YOU CAN GO AN ENTER YOUR LOCATION YOUR TIME WHERE YOU'RE GOING THE LOCATION AND AN IT'LL ACTUALLY BACK CALCULATING I'LL GIVE YOU FULL LIGHT A STIMULANT FOOD HIDRATION ISTS OF PROTOCOL AND YOU JUST FALLOW ALONG WITH THAT AND WE'VE USE THAT FOR MANY YEARS ACTUALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN TRAVELLING ON LIKE OPUDOBBY FOR WICE AND A MONCOLIAN AND BRAZIL FOR THE LEMPICS AND SO IT ALL OVER THE PLACE SO I'M THAT'S I THINK THAT APISTOLE AVAILABLE I HOPE SO I IT'S IT'S GREAT I A NICE TO IM A COUPLE OF THINGS WEVE FOUND MAJOR IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH ASCID REFLECT SO IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO HAS PROBLEMS LIKE THAT YOU CAN JUST ELEVATE THE HEAD OF YOUR BED BY LIKE SIX INCHES SO IF YOU YOU PUT LITTLE PIECE OF WAD OR SOMETHING UNDERNEATH IT I YOU CAN ALSO BUY VERY INEXPENSIVE PILLOWS I THAT CAN ELEVATE THAT NOW THAT'S NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM BUT AT LEAST CAN HELP YOU SLEEP IT WHETHER IT'S JUST THAT NIGHT OR IF IT'S A CONSISTENT PROBLEM YOU CAN DO THERE IM IF YOU'RE SNORING LIKE I SAID THAT'S NOT REALLY BENIN YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT YOU'RE FIRST STUP THERE IS MOUTH TEP I IF THAT DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN GO THROUGH ITS CALLED MILE FUNCTIONAL THERAPY I WHICH ON NON IF YOU'VE COVER THAT BEFORE BUT IT'S BASELY TONGUE EXERCISES I THAT CAN BE QUITE EFFECT OF SPECIFICALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH REM SLEEP SO MOUNT FUNCTIONAL THERA E I IT'S SISTA HAN IT'S CANLIKE YOU DO LIKE DEPENDNG O THE PROTOCAL A SOME TNGUE EXERCISES KIND OF THE MORNING AFTERNOON TER NIGHT AND THAT TAKES A WHILE TO BE HONEST  YOU PROBABLY GOING TO NEED LEAST SIX WEEKS BEFORE YOU START SAYING ANYTHING BUT THAT ACTUALLY IS IS PRETTY WELL DEMNSTRATED TO HELP LESSLEEP SO YOU CAN PROBABLY GUGLER COULD FIND A LINK FOR FOR EXACT PROTOCOSE IDON'T WANT A DESCRIBED BL THEM BUT YET YU CAN STRENGTHEN YOUR TONGUE SO THAT IT STOPS FALLING IN THE BACK OF YOUR NECK AND WAKING YOU UP AT NIGHT SO THAT'S A REALLY FREE EASY FREEPROTOCALL TO USE IM IF YOUR STRUGGLING WITH I IT COULD BE IN SOMNIA BUT I COULD BE JUSE THINGS LIKE WHEN YOU GET IN TO BED YOUR SUPERTIREN YOU CAN'T FALL ASLEEP OR THINGS LIKE THAT KIND OF A BASIC GRUL THUMBLY USE IS ONLY TWO THINGS HAPPEN IN YOUR BED AND IF YOU CAN MAKE SURE THOSE THE ONLY TWO THINGS YOU DO IN YOUR BED THE PROBLEMS OF FALLING SLEEPER AND SOMYOU TTEND TO GO DOWN THOSE TWO THINGS ARE YOU HAVE SEXON YOU SLEEP AND NOTHING ELSE GOES DOWN IN YOUR BED AND SO YOU CAN MAKE THAT ENVIRONMENT I'M VERY SPECIAL AND THACK CAN HELP A QUITE EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE YOUR BILITY TO FALL ASLEEP I THEN NOT WAKE UP EARLY SO KEEPING THAT ENVIRONMENT SPECIFIC TO WHAT IT'S FOR I CAN BE EFFECTED THE ONLY OTHER THING I COULD THINK OF IS AND I I HAN'T TO SAY THIS IS NOT SUPERPRACTICAL BUT IT'S JUST QUITE CLEAR AT THIS POINT SLEEPING WITH A PARTNER IN YOUR BED IT'S JUST NOT VERY GOOD FOR SLEEP SO YOUD LOOK WIT THAT ONE I KNOW I YOU CAN DO A COUPLE OF THINGS IF IT HELPS I YOU CAN GET TWO SMALLER BEDS AND PUT THEM RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER IIF YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SEPARATE SHEETS THAT ALONE CAN BE HELPFUL I'M SO IF YOU GET YOU MAY IF YOU'RE HON I KING SIZES BETTER SOMETHING I'MAN AGAIN I KNOW SOME PEOPLE IT IS LIKE THERE'S NO CHANCE BUT IF YOU WANT ANOTHER THE COST FOR YOUR LIKE THE IFAC AD YOUR RELATION YNOT YOUR USE YOUR LOVED ONE I REALLLLY IS DO WE OT O I YOTIS  I THE ONLY LASTING I WANT TO MENTION HERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S POPPED UP JUST A FEW TIMES RECENTLY BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MOR A WHICH IS CALLED ORTHOSOMNIA ISO THAT IS A TERM THAT IS PEOPLE ARE GROWING CONCERNED OVER A WHICH IS WERABLES AND SLEEP TRACKERS CAUSING SLEEP ISSUES SO PEOPLE BE BASKELY BECOME TOO UPSESSED WITH OPTIMIZING MAXIMIZING SCORES AND THAT ALONE WILL ACTUALLY ITS TEXTLY YOU SO YOU LEARN WHEN TO WAKE UP AND SO YOU HAVE ACTUALLY Y AND ITTISTPATORY RESPONSE WHEN MANY HOURS PIRE TO WAKING UP SO IF YOU ACTUALY LEARN TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A WHAT'S A LITTLE MOLECULE LIKE EXCITEM AN AND WHAT OH DOPA MEAN THAT'S THE ONE IF YOU START GETTING THAT COULD YOU WAKE UP WHEN YOU GET SUPEREXCITED THE CHECK YOUR SCORE OR YOUR FAULTY BUS THE SAMETHNG IF YOU CHECK YOUR PALN OR TWITTER WHENEVER IN MET MORNING THAT 'LL ACT YOU START CARVING BACK YOUR WAKE UP TIME BECAUSE YOU START LAUNCHING IT SO IT ACAN RUIN SLEEP BECOMING TO OBSESS SO WHAT I'LL SAY IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE A SLEEP TRACKER AND YOU JUST LIKE DON'T CARRY YOU ON CHECK AN YOU HAVE FUN ITH IT GREAT BUT IF LIKE YOU ARE REALLY REALLY REALLY INTERESTED IN IT AND YOU PAY LOT OF ATTENTION TO IT DON'T CHECK YOUR SLEEP SCORE FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST SIXTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING UP AN ANYA THAT SHOULD HELP YOU THAT'S A GREAT TOOALL I THINK THEYLL A AND PIECE OF ADVICE I THING GENERALLY BECAUSE I THING LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP THE MILL THE NIGHT CHECKING THEIR PHONE TWO OR THREE TIMES PER NIGHT  KIND OF WONDERING WHY THEY'RE DOING THAT AND I'M GUESSING ITS THIS INTICIPATORY WAKE UP CIRCUIT YET YOU ABSOLUTELY SHUD USE EITHER YOUR NIGHT MOTE OR DO NOT DISTURB OR AIR PLAIN MOTOR SOMETHING OVER NIGHT OR LEAVE IT OUT OF THE ROOM YET I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP AND LIKE SOME PEOPLE HAVE A LIKE A FAMILY MEMBER WHOSE MAY BE ON GREAT HEALTHNASS THEY HAVE TO GET YOUR PHONE AROUND A CEASE THEY CALL OR THINGS LIKE THAT SO I GET IT YOUR LIKE I CAN'T LEAVE IT OUT YEU LEAP IT IN THER LEAV IT AND DO NOT DISTURB AND ENTER AND THEIR PHO NUMBER WHOEVER SO NUMBER SO ONLY THEY CAN GET THROUGH BUT KEEP IT BLACK AND WHITE SIF YOU DO HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR PHONE AT NIGHT YOU SEE BLACK AND WHITE AND YOU DO NOT HAVE NOTIFICATION SO MAKE SURE THAT HERE'S NO NOTIFICATION FOR NO EMAL IN ANEU DIAM LIKE GET AL THAT SELF OFF YOUR SCREEN AND SO YOU LOOK AT THE DID ANYBODY CALLED ANNYBODY TECTS OF IMPORTANCE AM WHAT TIME IS IT NO EMERGENCY GOING ON BLACK AND WHITE OK RIGHT BACK TO SLEEP SO THAT CAN HELP A LITTLE BIT ONE OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT I'VE FOUND IS EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR BEING ABLE TO FALL BACK ASLEEP IF I'VE WOKEN UP IN MILL THE NIGHT AND FOR SOME REASON CAN'T UM AND IS ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE FOR INHANCING SLEEP WHEN ONE IS INJESTING FEWER CARBO HYDRATES ISSUED TE LOT OF PEOPLE RUN INTO UM OR FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE FASTING FOR MANY HOURS BEFORE SLEEP IN O PEOPLE OR TRYING TO NOT EAT ANYTHNG WITHIN UNSUTE OF FOUR HOURS BUT IS IT NOSITALL NINE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS OMI MY O AN OSITALL I I FIND AGAIN THIS IS ANIC DATA TO BE CLEAR THTIF I WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT AND I'VE TAKEN NINE HUNDRE MILEGRAMS OF AN OCITAL BEFORE INITIALLY FALLING ASLEEP THAT I FALL BACK TO SLEEP MUCH MORE EASILY SO THAT'S WHY I'VE ADDED NINE HUNDREDMILEGRAMS OF AN OSCITAL TO MY SO CALLED SLEEP STACK V ALSO TRIED JUST TAKING IT ALONE AND IT WORKS WELL ALONE BUT T WORKS BETTER GORSE WITH THE MAGTHREE AND EIGHT A APAGENAN THENING SLEEP STACK THE U THE ALSO IN TERMS OF TOOLS FOR SLEEP THE THE AP A REVERY THAT WAS DEVOLOVED BY MY COLLEAGUE DOCTOR DAVID'S FEOLE WHO'S A MEDICAL DOCTOR AT STAMFORD SYCHIETRY STIMMER SCHOOLMENSIN CYCHAETRY UM THERE IS A FREE TRIAL THERE'S A NOMINAL COST IF YOU USE IT UM MONTH O MONTH BUT THE DATA ARE REALLY STRONG THAT PEOPLE THAT USE THAT I THINK IT'S EIGHT TO ELEVEN MINUTES SLEEP HYPNOSIS ONCE TO WEEP AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN THEMILL THE NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP REALLY HELP IMPROVE PEOPLE'S AM ABILLY OF FALL ASLEEP QUICKLY STAY ASLEEP FALL BACK ASLEEP IF THEY WAKE UP IN MOL THE NIGHT IN SOME CASES CURING INSOLMNIA IN OTHER CASES RELIGIOUS HELPING PEOPLE WITH THEIR GENERAL SLEEP ISSUES AND I MENTION THIS BECAUSE I OBVUSIS TE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT A SUPPLEMENT BUT I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SUPPLEMENT OF VERSE ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT BY THE COST COMPARISON BETWEEN TAKING THE SLEEP SACT OTALY A AND THE REVERY AP IT'S PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR REALLY I'M SO GET I'M A PROPONING OF BOTH FOR MYSELF BUT I REALIZE THAT PEOPLE HAVE VARYING BUDGETS AND AGAIN I SHULD SAY AS ALWAYS BEHAVIOUR AL TOOLS FIRST AND I THINK OF THE REVERI AP AS AS MORE LESS OF BEHAVIORAL TOOL YET IT'S A IT'S REALLY JUST A TOOL ANY THESE PROTHWORK PROTOCALLS HIPNOS POTOCALLS THERE'S JUST A TOOL FOR YOU TO TOUCH BACKIN WITH YOUR ON PHYSIOLOGY RATHER THAN A A SUBSTANCE THAT'S COMING AND SO I I FULLY SUPPORT THOSE WE HAVE USED A NUMBER OF THOSE A IN IN PROTOCALLS THERE'S SOME OTHER TRICKS SO WE CAN PULL IN THOSE AREAS I I PROBITION SAY TIS BUT THE REALOV IT IS DEPENDING ON WHAT'S KEEPING YOU UP ISOMETIMES WE RECOMMEND JUST GETTING UP AND GETTING IT DONE  LIKE IF IT'S A REALLY THEY GIVE IT'S SA A PROJECT OR A THING OR WHATEVER I LIKE SOMETIMES IT RATHER THAN LYING THERE ALL NIGHT NOT SLEEPING YOU CAN GET UP GET IT DONE AND TH IF YOU STAY AWAKE FINE AT LEAST THE INXIETY'S GONE OR  SOMETIMES YOU GASH GO BCK TO SLEEP TU LIKE ESPECIALLY THE TASK ONLY LITTALY WOULD TAKE LIKE TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES I IT MAY RUIN YOUR SLEEP BUT YOUR CON HAVE RON SLEEP AHWAYS SO YOU CAN TRY THAT TOOL I YOU DON'T WANT TO PULL THAT CARDVERY OFTEN AND YOU HAVE TO H BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE SOMETHING WORTHY I'VE DOING THAT BUT THAT IS LIKE BETWEEND ME AND YOU AND NOBODY ELSE HERE THAT'S THE TOOL I HAVE USED PERSONALLY MORE THAN A FEW TIMES OR A SISLIKE I GET AN IDEA I DON'T LOSE IT OR LIKE THE SOLUTION FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN DOLING ON FOR A LONG TIME POPS IN YOUR HEAD JUST LIKE IN YOUR NOT WING TO FORGET JUST GET UP GET AT DONE AND GET ON TH YOUR DAY IN SEVERAL PREVIOUS EPISODES YOU EMPHASISE HOW EXERCISE INDUCES VERIOUS ADAPTATIONS DEPENDING ON THE TYPESPECIFICITY VOLUME INTENSITY CETERA OF THE EXERCISE AND THAT JURING EXERCISE THE DEGREE OF ADAPTATION THAT ONE TRIGGERS IS OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH THINGS THAT NORMALLY WE DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH EXERCISE RELATED HEALTH THINGS LIKE HUGE INCREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE DURING EXERCISE HUGE INCREASES IN INFLAMMATORY MARKERS MUSCLE DAMAGE AND THESE ALT THINGS ALL SOUND TERRIBLE BUT AS YOU BEAUTIFULLY EXPLAINED ALL OF THAT TRIGGER'S ADAPTATIONS THAT THEN BRING THOSE MARKERS BELOW THE BASE LINE WITH WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUS TO THE EXERCISE SO THAT'S THE ADAPTATION IN THE RECOVERY WITHIN THE REALM OF SUPPLEMENTATION NUTRICIAN I'M AWARE OF A NUMBER OF THINGS SA'ME URBAL SOME LIPID BASE OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT AR USE FOR VARIOUS THINGS BUT THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE A POTENT ANTI INFLAMMATORY EFFECT THINGS LIKE A MAGOTHRY FATIACIDS ASHA GONDE FOR ITS EFFECT ON COURT IS ALL ALTHOUGH THAT'S A BIT INDIRECT TO THE INFLAMMATORY PATHWAY UM CURCUMEN A AND THINGS OF THAT SORT GIVEN THAT WE WANT INFLAMMATION IN ORDER TO TRIGGER THE ADAPTATION RESPONSE TO EXERCISE AND GIVEN THAT WE WANT TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION IN THE RECOVERY PERIOD CAN WE PUT TOGETHER A LOGICAL FRAMEWORK AS TO WHEN IS BEST TO TAKE ANYTHING ANTI INFLAMMATORY WHETHER IT SUPPLEMENT BASE OR PRESCRIPTION OR OVER THE COUNTER DRUG AND WHEN TO STRICTLY AVOID TAKING ANY ANTIINFLAMATORY SUPPLEMENT OR UM A NO BEHAVRIAL TOOL YOU MENTION ICE CAN REDUCE INFLAMMATION THAT'S WHYT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT TOO CLOSE TO EXERCISE NU MAY I THINK YOU GET THE JIST OF THE QUESTION WHAT ABOUT SPECIFIC SUPPLEMENTS RELATED TO INFLAMMATION AND ANTI IFLAMMATORY RESPONSEIS WHAT ARE THE BEST ONES WHEN SHALL WE TAKE THEM WHEN SHOULL WE AVOID TAKEN THE WAY THAT I THINK ABOUT IT IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE CALL THE FITNESS FATIGUE MODEL SO  I MEAN BU THAT IS WHENEVER YOU DO SOME SORT OF INSULT THE WHOLE IDEA IS FOR YOU TO COME BACK AND GET AN ADAPTATION A RECOVERY IS NOT ADAPTATION Y RECOVER'S RECOVERY ADAPTATION IS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU'RE RECOVERED I SOWAS A VERY IMPORTANSTINCTION THAT FINISH FATIGUE MODELL SAYSBAS YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING AND YOU'VE GOT AN ADAPTATION AND YOU'VE ENHANCED FITNESS AND BY FITNESS IN THIS CASE I MEAN AS A NON SPECIFIC TERM SO YOU GOT STRONGER YOU I IMPROVE YOUR DERNS  WHATEVER THING YOU'RE TRYING TO TRAIN FOR AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH YOUR FATIGUE ELEVATED SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF FITNESS INCREASES AT THE SAME OR A SIMILAR RATE AS FATIGUE YOUR PERFORMANCE ACTUALY ISN'T ANY BETTER AND SO YOU MAY THINK ALL MY PROGRAM IS WORKING I NEED TO THEN TRAIN HARDER OR I NEED TO TAKE MORE AND IM FLAMTO OR WHATEVER THE THINGS ARE WHEN REALITY ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS REDUCE FATIGUE AND IF YOU DO THAT YOUR PERFORMANCE WILL INCREASE AND ALL THE TRAINING ADAPTATIONS WILL BE ACTUALIZED SO THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST INFORMOST IS ACTUALLY A TAPER SO THE THE FIRST STEP I THINK OF IF SOMEONE IS TRAINING VERY VERY HARD AND YOU'RE NOT SEEIN ANY RESULTS AND WE WANT THINK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION BEFORE I GET THERE I WANT TO THINK ABOUT TAPER AND DELOD IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRAINING HARD AND SLEEP AND ERYTHING ELSE IS TAKEN CARE SO JUST WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR INTOTAPER SOME GENERAL FOR GENERAL PERAMINERS THERE AND YOU WANT A THINK ABOUT ABOUT A FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN TRAINING VOLUME OVER THE COURSE OF ABOUT A WEEK FOR EVERY EIGHT WEEKS OF TRAINING SUPERSUPER ROUGH RIGHT SO IF YOUV BEEN TRAINING HARD FOR THREE MONHS FOR SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT A TAPER FOR TWO WEEKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT ITS SORT OF A ROUGH ESTIMATE THAT TAPER YOU ACTUALLY DON'T NEED TO REDUCE INTENSITY YCASE INTENSITY'S NOT THE DRIVER FATIGUE ATTEND TO BE VOLUME SO LONG AS YOUR VOLUME IS REDUCED BY FIFTY PERCENT YOU CAN MAINTAIN INTENSITY YOU CAN MAINTAIN IN FACT I GENTLY WOULD RECOMMEND MAINTA AINING FREQUENCY S REFOU USE TO WORK IN OUT FOR DAYS A WEEK KEEP IT FORDAYS WEEK YOU CAN GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT IN FREQUENCY BUT IF YOU GOT ON TOO MUCH IN FREQUENCY YOU ACTUALLY TEND TO FEEL SUPERLETHARGIC SO I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF YOU DO THOSE THINGS CORRECTLY YOU CAN TEN PICTLY SEA SOMEWHERE BETWEN LIKE A THREE TO EIGHT PER CENT IMPROVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE AN WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THAT AM WE ACTUALLY RAN A STUDY ON CROSS COUNTRY RUNNERS YEARS AGO TESTING ON A METABOLIC CARD  MUSCLE BYOPSES BLOOD A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS AND WE DID AT PREE IN POST THREE WEEKS OF TAPER AND WE ACTUALLY THIS IS COOL BECAUSE WE DID THIS IN  COMPETITIVE SEASON SEES WERE COLLEGIAT CROSS COUNTRY RUNNERS AND WE GOT THEM TO COME TO OUR LAB THREE WEEKS BEFORE THEIR CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP RAN THEM ALL THROUGH MUCH A TESTING BY OBSY THEM THEY WENT THROUGH THEI THREE WEEK TAPER AND WE BUY UP SEE THEM AGAIN AN THE THY WENT AND RAN AM THEIR CONFERENCE CHAMPIONGSHIPS S WELL WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY INT A PITTING ABOUT A FIFTY PER CENT REDUCTION BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID AS THEY TOOK OUT WHILL WE CALL THE JUNK VOLUME SO THEY KEPT THEIR RACE TEMPOST HINTENSITY STUFF IN THERE IM THEY KEPT THE RECOVERY STUFF IND THAT MEDIUM PACE THEY JUSTPASEY REDUCED NOW THEY WERE TERRIFIED AS ANY ENDURANCE RUNER OR DARENTE OUT LATER PURTISEMENT WOULD UNDERSTAND A WHEN YOU TAKE VOLUME AWAY THEY TEND TO GET VERY NERVOUS AND SO THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT  BUT AS A RESULT TO THAT WHAT WE SAW AS THEIR VIEW TO MACTS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY COVERED HALF THE MILAGE THEIR VEAL TO MACS DID NOT GO DOWN IN THREE WEEKS A REDUCED TAPER YOUR FITNESS IS IN IS EXTREMELY STABLE AND IN FACT ONCE WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THEIR DATA THE ENSIMES IN THEIR MUSCABLE RESPONSIBLE FOR OXYDATED MATABOLISM WERE MAINTAINED AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOSING AGAIN FITNESS WITH RETALKNG ABOUT OVER ALL PERFORMANCE OR EVEN AM OXYGEN CAPACITY MY O CONDRO FUNCTION ET CETERA THAT WAS ALL PRESERVED OBVIOUSLY WE SAW PERFORMANCE GO UP BUT WAS ACTUALL REALLY INTERESTING IS WE SAW I THINK IT WAS AROUNDED TEN  PER CENT INCREASE IN TIPE TO LICH YOUR FAST WITCH MUSCLE FIBR SIZE S WE SAW TEN PER CENT INCREASE IN FASTR FIBR SIZE AT THE END OF THREE WEEKS OF TAPERING NOW WHAT YOU MAY THINK IS LIKE WHILE I GUESS TAPERING IS ANABOLIC BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT WHAT HAPPEN WHAT REALISTICALLY PROBABLY HAPPENED WAS THEIR VOLUME OF TRAINING WAS ACTUALLY CAUSING THEIR FIBRES TO BE REDUCED IN SIZE AND THE ONCE WE REMOVE THAT FATIGUE THEY JUST RECOVERED BACK TO NORMAL SO THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT ONCE YOU REMOVE THE FATIGUE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IN HANSINSE AND PERFORMANCS NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE NECESSARILY GTTING BETTER BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE MOVING THE STIMULIE THAT SUPPRESSING HIM SO THAT BEING SAID THE WAY THA YOU WANT A THINK ABOUT RECOVERY LIKE THIS IS ALTHOUGH RECOVERY ESPECIALY THAT INJURY RECOVERY LIKE SEAMS CHAOTIC BIOLOGY'S VERY ORGANIZED AND THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC THREE STEP PROCESS THAT YOU CAN A GO THROUGH FOR RECOVERY AND THEN THERE ARE DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN HELP YOU IN EACH OF THOSE THREE AREAS SO ARYA ONE IS BASELY INFLAMMATION SO THIS IS WHEN THE SIDE A KIN STORM COMES ROLLING OUT A START SIGN ILING THE INJURIES THERE IN THE CASE EVEN IF IT'S MUSCLE DAMAGE 'M ANACTIV ATES I MUN SYSTEM TO KICK ON AN THAT WHOLE REPAIR PROCESS HAPPENS THERE I'M WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO EFFECTIVLHY INFECT THIS IS WHY Y YOU PROBABLY EVER WONDER LIKE WHY IS INFLAMMATION A THING I'M WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS BRING INFLUED ANHANDS TE SIZE AND INCREASE BLOOD FLOW INS THE GE NEUTRIANCS FOR REPAIR AND A MUN CELLS AND THAT IN THE SYSTEM AN GET THE WASTE OUT SO SHORT TERM INFLAMMATION EVEN THE CASE OF MUSCLE SORNESS IS THE EXAMPLE WE WEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS UPSO BUT ANY INFLAMMATION IT IS PART OF THE ECESSARY PROCESS THAT'S WHY YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO TAKE AN ANTINIFLAMATORY IN THAT STATE AN SO WHY YOU ALSO WOULD NOT WANT TO DO THINGS LIKE AN ICE SPOT I'M SO IN THAT IMMEDIATES IN FLAMATORY RESPONSE TIME WHENDOW THIS IS IN  SECONDS TO HOURS AFTER TRAINING YOU WOULD WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THINGS LIKE THAT I'M A GOOD OCTION HERE ARE THINGS LIKE A'LL MAKE A THREES 'M GOOD EVIDENCE SOMETHER SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF LIKE TWO TO FIVE GRAMS TOTAL TYPICALLY LIKE A ONE TO ONE IM EPITE D  CHE RATIO IS FINE SIMILARLY THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHEN GOOD DOES IT MEAN MORE IS BETTER I'M CAUS FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS EV A ACTUALLY EVIDENCE SHOWING UP TO FIFTEEN GRAMS WELL HARM THEY MEAN RESPONSE AND SO YOU DON'T DUST WONE TO BE LIKE MAP SUPERSOREUM TRAING HARD ER I'M JUS GOIG TO GO TO TEN GRAMS AND ORE MORE OR MORE MER YOU'RE ACTUALLY CAUSING YOURSELF MORE OF A PROBLEM I' SO ANTI OCINENS ANTON TE PLAMATORIES ARE FINE AGAIN I'LL MAKE A THRACE IN THAT DOSAGE I'M ARE A DECENT THING I'M YOU CAN ALSO DO SOMETHING LIKE FIVE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS OF KERCUMEN THREE TIMES A DAY THAT'S CON BE ENOUGH A TO KEEP YOU IN A DECENT SPOT 'M THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT YOU COULD LOOK UP A MAYBE SOME POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR GINGER I'M AN BASUELLIA AND SOMETHINGS LIKE THAT FOR INFLAMMATION BUT UNDER UNLESS WE'RE UN LIKE VERY SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE LIKE AN INJURY I MORE PROBABLY NOTE GOING TO THOSE YOU KNOW AREAS IT'S GOINE TO I LIKE ONE THING THAT CAME UP IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE SOME NOT ALL PEOPLE BUT SOME INCLUDING MYSELF ARE VERY SENSITIVE KIRKUMAN YET IT HAS A VERY POTENT EFFECT IN REDUCING D H T DHADR CESTOSTRON AND LEAST ALL SORTS OF A CLAMPING OF TESTOSTRONE ASSOCIATED POSITIVE THINGS SO IM I A EXPERIENCE THAT MYSELF I'VE HAD PEOPLE RIGHT TO ME AND SAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND I S ARE TAKING A SUPPLEMENT I'M KERCUMENCE MUS TO BE A GREAT ANTIME FLAMATORY IT FLAT LINE MY LEBIDO IT TOOK AWAY MY DRIVE I THIN I WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON THERE THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE VERY D H  SENSITIVE KERCUMEN WHILE IT'S A PODINENTINEFLAMATORY CAN ALSO PUTTONTLY REDUCE T H T BUT SOME PEOPLE TOLERATE IT QUITE WELL AND OUR HEARING THIS A POLY THING THAT'S RIDICULOUS WELL IT'S IM CERTAINLY SUBSTANTIATED BY THE BA CHEMICAL PATHWAYS THAT KERKUMAN TAPS INTOIN THE KNOWN ROLES OF D H T ON LEBITO AGGRESSION POWER OUTPUT ET CETERA AND MOOD SO JUST BE WEARY THAT I'M E THERE'S NO WAY TO PREDICT THIS ONE SIMPLY HAS TO FIGURED OUT IMPURIC LY MEAN YOU HAVE TO TRY AND SEE IF YOU LIKE IT OR DON'T A THE GOOD NEWS IS IS THOSE A NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE SEEM TO REVERSE PRETTY QUICKLY AFTER AM THE SEASING TO TAKE A KIRKUMEN SO JUST A MENTION OF SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT ING CASE PEOPLE DIN HEAR THAT ON THAT SEGMENT 'M JUST WANE TO HIGHLIKE THOSE THOSE FACTS FURTHER EVIDENCE Y I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE TAKING ANYTHING IN THE ANTINE FLAMENT OR ANTIOXEN AROUND ANLESS YOU ACTAL HAVE A REASON TO DO SO IM IF YOU'RE WAKING UP N MAYBE I'M INFLAMED THIT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD APPROACH LET'S HAVE A REASON TO DO SO STEP TOO IS ACTUAL WLE WE CALL PROLIFERATION AND THAT'S CONN LIKE THAT CLEAN UP CREW THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE OIN TO BE GOING IN THERE AND CLEANING OUT DEAD SELLS AND DEBRI AND MISFULD DE PROTINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AT THIS STAGE I FANTASTIC EVIDENT SPACE SUPPLEMENT A IT'S GLUDOME GLUDO MEAN TWENTY GRAMS TO DAY WE TYPICALLY HONESTLY SPUT IT UP INTO TWODOSAGE TENGRAMS MORNING TENGRAMS NIGHT IT'S A CONDITIONAL MENOACID WHICH MEANS YOU CAN MAKE IT  YOU'RE BODY CAN MAKE ENOUGH OF IT AT TIMES AN OTHER TIMES YOU MAY AVE SUPPORT IT A GENERALLY THOSE CONDITIONAL TIMES ARE THINGS LIKE BURN VICTIMS AM HIGH STRESS SITUATIONS OR INJURY THINGS LIKE THAT SO AM THERE ISN'T ALSO LIKE A TON OF DOWNSIDE TO GLUDOMIN BECAUSE IT CAN GO THROUGH A TRANSAMINATION WHICH MEANS YOUR BODY CAN TAKE IT AND SAY LIKE WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING HERE FOR OUR MUST RECOVERY LET'S MAKE IT INTO IN A SOMETHING ELSEAN USE IT IM FOR WHATEVER ELSE IS YEANI SO IT'S KIND OF ANOTHER ONE OF THESE LIKE LOW RISK A PRODUCTS IS ONSI WHY YOU SEE IT IN A LOT OF RECOVERY PRODUCTS A IF YOU EVER ONE I LIKE WAT THE HECAS THAT IN THERE I DON'T NEED TO MEANALASIS AN YOU'RE THINKING IT'S LIKE FOR PROTINE SENTHESIS ITS REALLY NOT IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS IT IS A BENEFICIAL TO THIS PROLIFERATION PROCESS I'VE BEEN TAKING GLUDOMING FOR YEARS AM I TEND TO TAKE IT IN HIRE DOSAGE IS SEVERAL TIMESTHROUGHOUT THE DAY IF I MEMBER FEELING PARTICULARLY RUN DOWN YI KNOW THEIR DECENT DATA NOT GREAT BUT DECENTAT ON THE ROLL OF GLUDOMI FOR LEEKY GOT TOTALLY FORE OFF SAYING LEAKY GOT THAT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT INTO THE REALM OF A LIKE NOT SUPERWELL SUBSTANTIATED BUT I IN  IN THE PURE REVIEWED LITERATURE BUT SOME A A LOT OF INECDATA AND AM AND CERTAINLY SOME PURE REVIEWED WORK BUNOT A TON AND THEN THERE IS ALSO A'M GROWING INTEREST IN THE IDEA THAT GLUDOMIN BECAUSE IT CAN TRIGGER ACTIVATION OF THE NURANS IN THE GOT THAT SIGNAL TO THE DOPOMING PATHWAY IN THE BRAIN THAT IT CAN BE USED TO OFFSET SUGAR CRAVINGS THIS IS OU HAVE AN INTERESTING NEW  AN EMERGING THEME WHICH YOU MAKE SENSE GIVEN THE BIOLOGY OF THE NURONS IN THE GOT THAT RESPOND TO A SPECIFIC AMINUACIS INCLUDING CLUDOMINE ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS AND SUGAR AND BECAUSE THEY RESPOND TO ANY  AN ALL THREE OF THOSE AM ANY ONE OR COMMINATION OF THOSE I SHOULD SAY A TO TRIGGER THIS DOPEMING RESPONSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN TO I A TEASPOON OR SO OF GLUDO OF GLUDMINE IN SOME WATER OR OTHER DRINK COUPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS A WAI REDUCE THER SUGAR CRAVINGS BECAUSE WHAT'S THE SENTIALY DOING IS IT'S TRICKING THE PATHWAY IN TAT INTO ACTIVATION OF THOSE NERANS THROUGH AN ALTERN IT A LEGAN RECEPTOR INTERACTION RIHT IALSO ANOTHER INTERESTING POINT THERARE VERY I'M TRAN THINK RY NOUNCED ON MY HEAD I CAN'T THINK OF A TIME AND I'VE USED CLUE TO MEAN A LOT I CAN'T THINK OF A TIME WHERE I'VE EVER HEARD NYBODY COME BACK WITH ANY SIDE OF FACT REPORTS I THINK IF YOU TAKE ENOUGH OF IT YOU CAN GET SOME GASTRIC DISTRESS BUT OF COURSE YOU TAKE ENOUGH OF IT  FROUDERD SUBSTANCE A IT MIXING WATER YOU GIN TO GET A A GASTR DISTRESS RESPONSE AND WHAT AVE NOSICE ABOUT GASTRIC DISTRESS WITH THINGS LIKE A CREOTINE GLUTOMINE AND EVEN PROACHING POWDERS FOR THAT MATTER I USE A HIG QUALITY A WAY PROACHING POWDER A ROUTINELY A IS THAT IF YOU BUILD UP TO IT OVER THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS THEN YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH USING MUCH HIGHER DOSAGES WITHOUT ANY ISSUE YEE A BIT ALLENEANE IS THE SAME THING BY THE WAY WE SORT OF TALKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER IF IF A YOU'VE EVER TRIED THAT YOU'R LIKE ALL MY GASH LIKE I FEEL LIKE I YOUS ROLLED AROUND O GRASS AND MY SKIN IS ITCHING AND OERE THAT A ANCE UNDER THE SKIN SENSATION YE WELL THAT'S THO U YOU GEAN TOS TAKE A BIT A BIT OF A LOWER DOSAGE AND BE FINE BUT FOR THE MOST PART AND THEN YOU WILL BUILD UP A TOLERANCE TO THAT PRETTY QUICKLY SO YOU CAN UP THAT DOSAGE ALONG THE WAY SO WHAT WE'LL OFTEN TIMES DO THEIR START AT A DOSAGE THAT'S PRETTY MINIMAL LIKE TWO GRAMS AND THEN EVERY WEEK OR SO YOU CAN GO UP ANOTHER GRAM UNTILL YOU GET TO WHATEVER FINAL POINT YOU WANT TO BE FIVE SIX GRAMS DAY YO WHATEVER I'M SO THT'S ANOTHER WY CONSORTO MINTIGATE THAT PROBLEM THT E THIRD STEP IN THIS RECOVERY PROCESS AFTER INFLAMMATION PROLIFERATION WERE NOW INTO REMODELLING AND THIS IS WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY YOU DON'T COTON'T GROWING BACK BIGGER AND STRONGER AM THIS IS WHERE TH MAJORITY OF THE REPARISACTUALLY TAKING PLACE AND AT THIS POINT WHERE BASELY PLAYING A MIKE FOR NEW TRAN AND MACKERNU TRAIN GAME IT BY THAT I MEAN WEVE TALKED ABOUT BASIC MACK OR NEUTRIANS A ONE THING TO PAY ATTENTION TO OFTEN TIMES IF PEOPLE ARE HURT WHETHER THEY HAD AN INJURY OR THEY'VE HAD A JUST THEIR SUPERSORT AND THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT EATING EXCESS CALLORIES THEY TEN TO ONE WHO EAT LESS FOOD DURING THIS PROCESS AS ARE LIKE I'M NOT WORKING OUT SO MUCH SO I' MA NOT EAT LESS CALLORIES ONE OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO IS INJURY CAN INCREASE SPASE O METABOLIC RATE BY UP TO TEN PER CENT SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN GENERAL IS JUST TAKE YOUR CALORIES UP ABOUT TEN PER CENT A LEAST THAT'S WHAT I RECOMMEND A IF THAT IS AN EXSTENDED PERIOD OF TIME THAN YES YOU MAY PUT ON A SLIGHT AMOUNT O BODY FAT OR SOMETHING BUT IF THAT ALSO MEANS YOU COME BACK SOME PERCENTAGE FASTER THEN IT'S WORTH THE EXCHANGE SO WE RECOMMEND THAT IN TERMS OF YOUR CARBOHYDRATE OR FAT SPLIT I'M NOT SUPERWORRIED ABOUT IT MY GENERAL RECOMMEDATION IS JUS DON'T MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES RELATIVE TO WHAT YOU WERE DOING I KEEP YOURSELF A PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME SPOT IN TERMS OF PROTINE THIS IS THE BIG ONE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY AT ONE GRAM PEROPOUND BODY WEIGHT BECAUSE WE NEED THOSE A MEANAL ASSIS TO COME IN IN SORT HELPING A WITH RECOVERY ONE GRAM A APPROACHY PREPOUNDER BODY WA ORN MORE OR ONE GRAN OR MORE YE THE EMNIS CAN BE VERY LITTLE DOWNSIDE TO TO HAVING MORE I'M BUT REMEMBER PROTINE AND CARBAHYDRATES BOTH STIMULATE INSOLENT AND REMEMBER INSOLENT IS ANABOLIC AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO DRIVE THIS PROCESS OF RECOVERY I THAT'S WHY YOU WANT BULSO YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SKIMP ON CARBA HYDRATES IN THIS FACE NOR WOULD YOU WAN A SKIMPON PROTINE BECAUSE YOU NEED THE ACTIVATION THE DRIVE INTO THE TISSUE AS WELL AS THIS STRUCTURE GOING BACK TO ONE OF EARLIER CONVERSATIONS AND AT THIS POINT IN THE WEEK I HONESTY CAN'T REMEMBER AT ALL WHAT EPISODE WE COVER THIS IN BUT I GAVE AN ANALOGY ABOUT I'M USE IT MAKING A CAMP FIRE AND USING FAT AND CARBAHYDRATES IS THE WOULD IN THE LOG AND THE PROTINE WORTHY THE THE METAL STRUCTURE SO YOU NEED THAT SUPPLY IF YOURE TRYING TO BANK IF YOU'VE CLEARED OUT IN THE PREVIOUS TUP I'M DAMAGE PROTINES AND YOU NEED TO MAKE NEW ONES TO RECOVER THAT PROCESS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RA SUPPLY IN MATERIAL SO YO WOULDN'T WANT AVOID EITHER ONE O THOSE THINGS IM THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME INDIRECT INFLEMMATION MANAGEMENT THAT COMES FROM PHADIASIS BUT YOU ACTALY SORT OF A LUDITO EARLIER I'M I DON'T THINK YOU NEED' NECESSARILY GO CRAZY  DON'T NEED TO CHANGE YOU'R FAT AND TAKE THAT MUCH JUST DON'T DROP IT I I DEPENDING ONWER YOUR HAT SO IF YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER CARB LOR FAT PERSON GREAT IF YOU'RE MODERATE GREAT IF YOU'RE THE INDIRECT IF YOU'RE HIGHER FAT LOR CAR PERSON OSSUM JUST DON'T MAKE AN EXTREME CHANGE AND DON'T AND TRY TO NOT BEYON THE EXTREMES OF EITHER ONE OF THOSE RATIOS BUT I THE ONLY SPECIFIC NUMBER TO PAY ATTENTION AGAIN IS THAT PROTINE NUMBERAND IF YOU GO LITTLABUT HIGH OR EVEN A LOT HIGH IT'S TOTALLY FINE JUST DON'T GO LOW SO THAT'S THE THE MACRONUTRI PORTION OF REMODELLING M TRIMS OF MICRONUTRIANS TO BE HONEST YYOU JUST GET YOUR BASIS COVERED  THIS IS ONE A BASIC MULTI VITEMEN I IT IS E FACT OF WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT HERE ARE VITEMAN ANES SINK THEY ACTUALLY HAVE INDEPENDENT MECHANISMS ARE A HELPHFUL HERE I'M BUT THOSE ARE TIPICALLY COVERED IN MOST MULTIVITEMEN SO WE GENERALLY ISGIVE PEOPLE A MULTI VIDEMEN I MAGNESIUM IS ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME  BENEFITS HERE SOMETHING LIKE SIX MELEGRAMS PR KILEGRAM OF BODY WAIK IS THE DOSE AGE YOU'RE OOKING FOR THERE I'M MAGNESIUM SITRATE IS PROBABLY HAS THE MOST EVIDENCE I INTRIMS OF THIS RESPECT BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IACTULO NO REASON TO THINK YOU COULDN'T USE GLICENADE OR IF YOU USING NOTHER FORM FOR SLEEP A THAT PROBABLY FINE I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE BUT I I CAN'T THINK OF A REASON WHY THE OTHER FORMS OF ANESIUM WOULD ALL THE SUDDEN NOT WORK SO YOU COULD PROBABLY CHOOSE WHICHEVER FORM YOU LIKE I OBBEIT CITRATE HAS PROBABLY THE MOST RESEARCH IN THIS ASPECT THE ONLY OTHER THINGS YOU WOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER HERE A THREE THINGS I'M CALCIUN MIGHT BE ON YOUR LIST PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO IF YOU'RE CONCERN IS SOME SORT OF BONE INJURY AND WE SORT OF GONE PASS LIKE RECOVERYING RACH IKE INTO INJURY I'M SEEYOU SEE THAT IN RE COVERY PRODUCTS OCCASIONALLY AND THAT'S WHY AND IN THE LAST TWO ONES OF COURSE OUR VITEM INDEED AND THAT'S PRETTY WELL RESEARCHED THEN THE LAST ONE IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP YOU IF YOU'RE AT THE STAGE AND YOU STILL AURE DEALING WITH THE LOT OF SORENES OR NOT AND THAT IS TART CHERRY TUSE NOT'S ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE FOR ON BOTH DOMS MUSCLE INJURY  MUSCLESORNES AND ACTUALLY HAS ANOTHER BENEFIT OF POTENTIALLY AIDING WITH SLEEP SO NOT A BAD ONE TO TURN TO AS WELL THERE'S A NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT MAKE THESE THINGS OF AN THN TERE'S ICTOALY MORE I'N GOING RESEARCH THAT I KNOW UNNO SERIOUS BUT I PROMISING LITERATURE WILL SAY NOT OFTEN BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ON THIS PODCAST I WILL SOLICIT SOCIAL MEDIA FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE WHERE I SHOULD SAY THE AUDIENCE TO BE AND THEN ASK SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS ON THE FLY DURING THE APODCAST I DO THIS WITH DOCTOR LIKE'S FREEDMEN I'M GOING TO DO WITH YOU YOUR GOAL IS TO ANSWER EACH OF THESE QUESTIONS CERTAINLY NOT ALL OF THEM TOU THA AT ABOUTWITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF OURS TO ANSWER EACH OF THESE QUESTIONS IN THREE OR FOUR SENTENCES I CERTAINLY WON'T BE COUNTING THE NUMBER OF SENTENCES THAT YOU SPEAK SO JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU WANT TO GO OVER A LITTLE BIT THAT'S FINE BUT FEEL FREE TO REFER TO YOUR INSTRGAMSITE AT A FUTURE TIME WHERE YOU MIGHT GO MORE IN DEPTH OR TO REFER TO A STUDY OR UM IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN ALSO SAY PASS IF YOU DON'T THINK T YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION UM A SUSTINCTLY ENOUGH FOR THIS FORM AT AND HEARE THE GOAL IS NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT I THE GOAL IS SIMPLY TO ALLOW THE AUDIENCE TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AND I I CONFESS I'M LOOKING AT THESE FOR THE FIRST TIME I SO I'LL TRY AND BE QWICK WITH MY WITH MY READING UM SOME OF THESE WE MAY HAVE TOUCHED ORN IN PREVIOUS EPISODES OR IN THIS EPISODE EVEN IN WHICH CASE YOU CAN CAN OF CUE US TO THE REMINDER THIS IS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TOI SUPPLEMENTATION BUT IT IS RELATED TO NUTRITION AND I DON'T THINK WE TOUCHED ON THIS DIRECTLY CAN WE DO INTERMITTENT FASTING AC TIM ERSTRICE FEEDING WITH QEITO AND STILL GAIN MUSCLEMESS TEBEDY I AM AM QUITE CLEAR SUCH STUDY DOES NOT EXIST SO I DON'T KNOW I THNK OF ALLUDED TO TO A BEFORE THAT WE DID RUN IN INTERMITTAN FASTING SIXTEEN EIGHT I PERCHFY STUDY THERE IS NO QUEITO ARM THE RESULT OF THAT STUDY BUTHE TIME THAS COMES OUT WILL PROBABLY BE RIADY THOUGH I NOT SURE SO I CAN'T COMMENT ON I HAVE LOIKE THE DAY BUT REGARDING WHEN IAV YEU DED THAT WITH QEETO OR NOT I CAN'T COMMENT SCIENTIFICALLY DO YOU EVER PRESCRIBE THE USE OF GABA SUPPLEMENTS WELL I CAN'T PRESCRIBE ANYTHING TO TO MAKE SURE WERE CLEAR BUT YOUR PROFESSOR YOU CAN PROFESS I CANDA CROG AS WE GENERALLY DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME I GABA IT RARELY IS IT OCADE TO WAIT TRAINED FASTED THAN NOT BREAK THE FAST AND EAT FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS AFTER TRAINING SO ANOTHER WORDS TRAIN FASTED I DO THIS BUT THEN ALSO NOT EAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING TRAINING AND WAIT ANOTHER THREE TO FOUR HOURS AFTER TRAINING ONCE WE HAVE OUR WRESULTS FROM MINER MEN FASTING STUDY BACK WELL WE WILL HAVE AB T OUR ANSWER HERE MY GENERAL RECOMMEDATION AS IT STANDS NOW THOUGH IS IS LONG AS YOUR TOTAL APPROACHING AND TAKE IS SUFFICIENT A YOU SHOULD BE IN A DECENT SPOT GREAT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FASTING AND TRAINING JUST TO YE I OTE THAT AM CAN YOU TRAIN HIGH PERFORMANCE FASTED AND HOW LONG BEFORE A YOU NEED TO REFUEL THE BODY YET YOU CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT I KNOW OF ACTUALLY MANYAPLETES SOME HOW THEYS IT WILL DO THAT THOUGH THE VAST MATORITY WILL NOT AS IT GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER AN INTENSITY AND ORDERATION IT GETS MORE CHALLENGING BUT IT REALLY DOES COME DOWN DO WHAT YOU DID THE DAY BEFORE AS WELL SO IF YOU AID SUFFICIENT CALORIES TA DAY BEFORE I DIDN'T TRAIN AND YOUR LYCATINSTORERS ARE TOPDOFF YOU HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE NOW THE DURATION PART OF THAT OCQUASION IS REALLY DECENDENT EPENDENT UPON YOU AM SO ARE YOU REALLY TALKING THIRTY FORTY FIVE MEN AT SIXTY MINUTES YOUR PROBABLY FINE WHETHER YOUARE OUT PAST THAT IN SEVERAL HOURS YOU MAY NOT BE AND THEN THE ONLY OF THE COMMON I WOULD MAKE IS THERE IS KEEP IN MIND WHENEVER YOU THINK ABOUT FASTING AND ANY OTHER SAY AGAINST THE TEXTBOOK IN A COTON COTSTRAT STYLE YOU REALLY REALLYE NEED TO BE CAREFUL IN THINKING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAN I DO IT AND IS IT OPTIMAL SO I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO THINK FASTING LIKE THAT WOULD IMPROVE PERFORMANCE I ONLY WORK FOR THE MOST PART WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO PERFORM AT THE HIGHESLITLE POSSIBLE SO I CAN'T THINK OF CENAO WHICH I WOULD GO TOO FASTING TO TRY AND HAS PERFORMANCE SO WHETHER NOT YOU CAN MAINTAIN SOME LEVEL PERFORMANCE PROBABLY I WILL IT PROVIDING BENEFIT I STRUGGLE TO FIND SONAROS IN WHICH THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE YOU PERFORM BETTER HOW DO DIFFERENT FORMS OF CARBAHYDRATES IN PACT PERFORMANCE AND THE RIGHT BELOW IT ANOTHER QUESHIN ABOUT CARBAHYDRATES WHICH IS DAS CARBAYDRATE CYCLING WORK SO THESE ARE TO A QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE THAT I THINK DON'T KNOW ONE ANOTHER BUT OUT OF CARB QUESTIONS ABOUT CARBAHYDRAES IN PERFORMANCE WHICH WE'VE TOUCHED ON ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT CONVERSATION I DON'T THINK I REALLY MAY BE YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT CARB LOADING A SLASH CARB CYCLING SO CARBAHYDRATE LOADING DOES HELP HOWEVER A MISS CONCEPTION THERE IS ITS JUST B O A BIG BULL APOSTO THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT CAN HELP TOP OFF STORAGES BUT REALLY OPTIMAL CARBHYDRATE LOADING PRIOR TO A LONG DURATION ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE IS PROBABLY BEST OVER THE COURSE OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS SEEU AN A GRADUALLY INCREASE CARBAHYDRATE AND TAKE FOR MULTIPLE DAYS RATHER THAN TOS HAVE ONE BIG BOLLAPOSTA BRANCH CHAIN EMENO ACIDS AND ESSENTIAL MINO ASCID SUPPLEMENTATION YE MAY OR AS I WOULD SAY ME IMA USUALLY IF YOUR TOTAL PPROACHING AND TAKE IS FINE THEN YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A NEED FOR THEM A IF YOU'RE FOR WHATEVER ANY NUMBER OF VALID REASONS TOTA PROTAIN IS NOT THEN  GOING TO AN ESSENTIAL MENOACID WOULD BE MY FIRST STEP RATHER THAN A B S E I'M NOW ADMITTEDLY WE ACTUALLY DO USE I ESSENTIALLY MUNOASSIS SOMEWHAT REGULARLY BECAUSE IT'S IS ALSO SORT LIKE A THERE'S NO REAL HARM OTHER THAN IF YOU'RE PRICE CONSCIOUS YOUR SORT LIKE I WASING MONEY THAT'S FINE THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH GENERALY AGAIN THAT'S NOT A FEW DOLLARS FOR THE MAXIMAS RECOVERIES IS NOT THAT VERY SO WE WILL SOMETIMES USE THAT A PREMINTERPOSE TRAINING AND IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES A TOTAL PROTINE WOULD BE MY IS A HIGH QUALITY WAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT IM IF YOU CAN'T USE WAY FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE ARE PLENTY OF HIGH QUALITY VIGAN A PROTINS YOU COULD USE IF YOU OUGHT TO TOP ALL THAT OFF THOUGH AN ADD SOM SIMCOMEMY TOASSES IT WOULDN'T HURT ANYTHING AND MAY POTENTIALLY HELP SLIGHTLY SO YOU CHOOSE I BASE ON THAT OGRITHM AH I WAS HOPING SOMEBODY WOULD ASK THIS TOUCHE ON IN A LITTLE BIT IT'S A LE BIT OF A LOADED QUESTION THE WAY THEY PHRASED IT SO I'M AT RISK OF LEADING THE WITNESS DOES THE MYTHICAL ANABOLIC WINDOW REALLY EXIST I'M JUST LAUGHING IS THE WAY THEY POS THE QUESTION THATRE ALREADY TELLING US WHETE THEIR STANDS IS UM MAKING IT MORE EFFECTIVE AS TO CREATE HYPEERTROPHY A TO EAT WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRIM AFTER WORKING OUT I'M GOING TO RESSUME THAT THIS PERSON GENUINELY WANTS TO KNOW WHETHER NOT THE ANABLIC WINDOW REALLY EXIST WERE NOT UM BECAUSE THEY REFERE TO IT IS MYTHICAL UASSUME THAT THEIR UM SUSPICIOUS BUT WHAT'S THE DEAL AS THE ANABOLIC WINDOW A REAL THING THE POST EXERCISE ANABOLIC WINDOW IS EXTREMELY REAL SO WHAT THIS IS A YOU CAN SEE MORE DETAIL IN A NUMBER OF VIDIOS ON MY OU TO PAGE I BELIEVE IT IS THE IDEA THAT YOU NEED TO MUST I CONSUME SOME SORT OF NEWTRANS SPECIFICALLY USUALLY PROTINE AIN SOME TIME DOMAIN THIRTY OR SIXTY MINUTES A POST EXERCISE AN OR TWO MAXIMASGROPE SO IS THAT WINDOW REAL YES ARE YOU HYPRISENSITIZED TO NEUTRANS IN THAT TIME FRAME YES IS IT VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU REHYDRATE A REPLENISH MUSCLIC LIKE AGIN AND REBUILD TISSUE A QUICKLY AFTER EXERCISE TO MAXOM AS RECOVERY ABSOLUTELY IT'S NOT REAL THOUGH IN THE SENSE THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES I'M IN THE CASE OF PROTING AS WE TALKED ABOUT A SECOND GL YOU'RE TOTAL PROATING AND TAKE THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS MORE IMPORTANT A TIMING THOUGH FOUR THINGS LIKE CARBAHYDRATE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'R TRAINING MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY IT IS VERY REALL SO IT IS A VERY REAL THING IT' JUST YOU MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT IT IT MAY NOT BE IMPORTANT FOR YOUR CONTEXT GARLIC SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION WHAT IF ANY FUNCTIONAL ROLLS DOES GARLIC HAVE IN PERFORMANCE GARLICS ACTS YOU REALLY COOL THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS YOU CAN DIVE INTO THETTER OUTSIDE OF MY THREE TO FORSENSE IS CONSIDERING A MAT LIKE TO AN A HALF PROBI ALREADY IM YOU'RE NOT IN A FINE STRONG HUMAN DATA ON GARLIC EXTRACT HOWEVER THERE IS A LITTLE BIT A SUGGEST YIT CAN ACTUALLY IN HANDS RECOVERY FROM INJURY OR POTENTALLY TISSUE DAMAGE SO YOU GOT A KIND OF BE CAREFUL THOUGH BECAUSE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WAS HAPPENING YOU HAVE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A NATE AN ADAPT OF RECOVERY PRO CISES AND WHEN WE SAY THINGS LIKE IMMUNITY REALIZED FENDE THAT'S NOT ONE THING THAT'S US LIKE A VERY COLOCAL TERM FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS AGAIN IT'S O VERB LI O THE NOWN WRIT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BUT IT IMMUNITY IS A BUNCH OF PROCESSES AR PROCESSES O IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO CORRECT MY SPEECH ALL CORRECT YEARS RIGHT BACK AM NOT YOURS ANDY YET LESSNERS PROSS IS BUT TOMATEO TOMOTO IT'S AVERB IMMUNITY IS A VERB THIS IS MY PROBLEM WITH IMUNE BOOSTERS SAME ISSUE RIGTLIK WILL WHAT ARE YOU BOOSTING SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IN FACT IF YOU'RE BOOSTING THE WRONG PART OF UNITY DURING THE WRONG PHASE OF RECOVERY WITH GARLIC YOU MAY BE ACTUALLY HURTING I THIN THE PROCESS BECAUSE YOU ARE THEORETIC THEY COULD BE TRYING TO DOWN REGULATE THAT PORTIONS THAT YOU CAN UP REGULATE A EXT PORTION THAT'S THE FASTERA WAY TO SAY IT IF YOU WILL SO A WE ACTU YOU MAY SEE MORE DY TO COME OUT THAT SAYS THE GARLIC EXTRACTS OVERRATED I DON'T ACTUALY DON'T YOU KNOW YET A BUT JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HUMAN DAT TO HON IT BUT YET T THERE'S SOMESULF THERE IF YOU WANT TO LOOK CARTENOUGH I'MAN ASKED THIS QUESTION FOR MYSELF CAUSE I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW THE ANSWER SELFISH TART CHERRY EXTRACT FR A PRETTY EFFECTIVE ACTUALLY A FOR TOO THINGS I PETENTUALLY HATE ATING IN SLEEP GETTING U SLEEP AS WELL AS A MUSCLE SORNESS THAT'S THE BULK OF THE RESEARCH IS IN MUSCLE SORENESS AND A SEEMS TO BE A MODERANE FECTOR THINK FOR PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN DOSTAGES OF THINGS LIKE TARTCHERRY EXTRACT GARLIC ET CETERA U OBVIOUSLY DOCTOR AND GALPANS INSTEGRAM AND TWIT ER GREAT PLACES TO ASK QUESTIONS LIKE THAT AND TO FINE QUESTIANSWERS TO QUESTIONS LIKE THAT AS WELL AS EXAMINE NOT CALM AS A TERRIFIC WEB SIGHT AUM THEY ACTUALLY RECENTLY OVERHAULED THEIR ENTIRE WEB SIGHT SO THEY HAVE THIS HUMAN EFFECT MAN TRICKS THAT SHOWS THE AM THE EFFECTS AN THE THE STRENGTH OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS IN HUMAN STUDIES OF MANY MANY DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS AUM I RELANED EVERYTHING TO YOU KNOW FORMOL HEALTH AND MEN AND WOMEN SPORTS PERFORMANCE COGNAT PERFORMANCE IT DOESN'T COVER EVERYTHING BUT IT CERTAINLY COVERS A LOT WITH LINKS TO STUDIES THERE'S A LOT THAT'S AVAILABLE AT COMPLETELY ZERO COST BY JOINING EXAMINE DOT CALM A YOU CAN ACCESS SOME ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND THIS IS BY THE WAY NOT A PAID ENDORSEMENT FROM EXAMINED OT COLMOM SIMPLY LONG TIME USER OF EXAMINED OT CALM MYSELF AM AND SO I JUST WANT A CUW PEOPLE TO IT AND AGAIN A MANY OF THE RESOURCES THERE ARE AVAILABLE COMPLETELY FREE OF COSTS IT'S A WONDERFUL SIGHT UM SO FOR DOSTAGES OF GARLIC TARTCHERRY EXTRACT AND THINGS OF THAT SORT WHETHER NOT YOU'REGTTING FROM FOOD O YOU'RE ETTING IT FROM EXTRACT A POWDERS RATHER AM ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS IS PRETTY NICELY LAID OUT THERE SO UNLESS YOU HVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO THAT I WAS JUST CAN ACU PEOPLE TO THAT RESOURCE NOB AN USING THAT SINCE THE FIRST DAY THOT WHEPSIDE WAS LODCHED I I WAS MADE AWARE THAT IT WAS COMING I BEEN FORTUNES TON OW THOSE GUISES FOR A WHILE I'VE SO YOUI'VE USED IT I USED IT IN ALL MY CLASSES I USE IT IDON'T E NO PROBABLY WEEKLY AT THIS POINT ANOTHER NEED NICE FEATURE THAT'S ECTUALLY ON THERE IS THEY HAVE A A SERIES OF LIKE THE DO SOME TOPICAL REVIEW TH SPACE SPACEITLE RI A BIG PAPER OUT ON MUSCLE DAMAGE OR BLOOD PRESSURE THE STASTRON TO SATHORDHANDSMEN OR AM FORMONT A YOU MENSTRAL CYCLE AND AND YET PICYOO ASK I DI THEY DO ON AND ALL KINDS OF SOF SEPEN SEARCH BY TOPIC I LIKE NO ENERGY O RECOVERY OR WHATEVER R EVEN SEARCH BY A BLACK HUMAN SEE EXTRACTOR LIKE WHATEVER NUMBER OF THINGS YOU WANT TO DO AND I'LL ALSO TELL YOU THERE'S AN NOUR ACTIONS PATEM TO SUCH REALLY REALY NICE SO BE CAREFULLY PORTAKING A HAND BE OR WHATEVER SO AYET IT'S WONDERFUL WONDERFUL THEY'VE DONE A MARVELOUS JOB SO THANK YOU EXAMINED I COME KEEP KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK WELL WE'VE COME CLOSE TO THE END OF THIS EPISODE AND THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE CLOSE TO THE END OF THIS SERIES WHERE YOU HAVE SO GRACIOUSLY JOINED US FOR SIX FULL EPISODES OF THE HUBRMEN LADPODCAST TO EDUCATE US ON ALL THINGS FITNESS EPISODE ONE YOU REVIEWED AND EDUCATED US ON ASSESSING OUR LEVEL OF FITNESS IN FACT I LEARNED SO MANY WAYS OF ASSESSING FITNESSTHAT I HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT AND ALSO ASSESSING MY RECOVERY CAPACITY FOR INSTANCE ONE THING THAT I'M DEFILING GOING TO IMPLEMENT FROM THAT EPISODE IS A ROUTINE BROAD JUMP TEST AND IAND IN HOME I JUMP JUMPIN TOUCH TEST IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M REFERRING TO THIT'S ALL CONTAINED IN THAT EPISODE ITS TIME STAMPED THESE ARE VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD ZERO COST WAYS TO ASSESS ONE'S LEVEL OF FITNESS I'M THERE A FEW OTHERS THAT REQUIRE A BARE MINIMENT OF TECHNOLOGY LIKE TAKING YOUR PULSE RADE IN VERY SPECIFIC WAYS O SPECIFIC TIMES ALSO IS SOM TIMING OF MILE RUNS AND SOME OTHER THINGS RELAID TO STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE AND ON AND ON REALLY IT'S A IT'S A BUFFET OF OPTIONS THAT WE CAN SELECT FROM AND I ALREADY KNOW THE FOUR OR FIVE THAT IE STARTED IMPLEMENTING THIS WEEK I'VE RECOGNIZED HOW I'M PRETTY GOOD IN A COUPLE OF AREAS I'M DOING MAY BE MAY BE BETTER THAN PRETTY WELL IN ONE AREA BUT THAT I'M DOING A IMTHISY WORLY IN A FEW AREAS THAT AM I JUST WASN'T AWARE OF AND SO I'VE A ALREADY STARTED IM TAKING ALWAYS TO A JUST THAT A RETIME AN O I'LL KEEP PEOPLE POSTED SO THAT FIRST EPISODE IS ABSOLUTLY INCREDIBLE AND JUST PROVIDES SO MUCH ACTIONABLE KNOWLEDGE AND THE RATION OL BEHIND IT THE SECOND EPISODE YOU EDUCATED US ABOUT STRENGTH SPEED AND HYPERTROPHY TRAINING AND THERE TOO AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF INCREDIBLE KNOWLEDGE WE GOT WAY DOWN INTO THE DETAILS YOU EXPLAIN SETS RETS THE RATION AWL FOR SETS RETS REST CADENCE NUMBER OF WORKOUTS PER WEEK I'M DEFLING IN TO TAKE AWAY MY NEED TO DO SOME SPEED BASE TRAINING AND SOME POWER BASE TRAINING NORMALY I THINKIN TERMS OF STRENGTH OR HYPERTROPHE AND I'M RELIEV F TO LEARN THAT A LOT OF THE SPEED AND POWER BASE TRAINING IT IS LOW INTENSITY ENOUGH THAT IT CAN BE DONE FAIRLY OFTEN AND INCORPORATED INTO MY PROGRAM WHICH IS ALREADY TOUCHES ON STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AND INDEED SOME ENDURANCE WORK AS WELL A AMAZING TIPSY PROVIDED THERE I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE THREE TO FIVE PROGRAM THT YO DESCRIBE IM THREE TO FIVE EXERCISE IS DONE FOR THREE TO FIVE REPETITIONS THREE TO FIVE MINUTES BETWEEN SETS AH YOU'RE DOING THIS THREET OF FIVE TIMES PER WEEK AND SO ON IN SOL WITH ALL THE DETAILS AGAIN TIMESTAMPED UM IN THE STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY A EPISODE SHOWNOUT SUCH AS INCREDIBLE WEVING USE THAT TO SET UP PIERRE WITH YOU THAT'S RIGHT I DID PAR THIS WEEK THANKS THANKS TO YOUR IN PUT AND FOLLOWING THAT PROGRAMM AND UM I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT IT IT DOES FEEL GOOD TO BREAK THROUGH A BARRIER UM AND I INTEND TO BREAK THROUGH MORE BARRIERS BUT NOT JUST WITH STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY BECAUSE EPISODE THREE YOU TAUGHT US ALL ABOUT IN DURANCE THE FOUR DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENDURANCE HOW TO TRAIN FOR EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT FORMS THE VALUE OF DOING EVEN VERY BRIEF TWENTY SECOND SPRINGS ARE BOUTS OF JUMPING JACKS THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHICH TO SOME PEOPLE MIGHT YOU SOUN LIKE A YOU KNOW LIKE A L HACK OR GIVE ME BUT NO THESE ARE ACTUALY TAPPING INTO FUEL SYSTEMS AND MODES OF NURL MUSCULAR INTRACTIONS THAT GREATLY AID OTHER FORMS OF ENDURANCE LIKE LONG DURATION EN DURANCE I WOULD LOVE TO RETURN TO MY IUM HIGH SCHOOL MILE TIME I WON'T REVEAL WHAT THAT IS CAUS ISIS IS NOT REALLY ABOUT ME BUT I PLAN TOST ARE DOING UM IF NOT MILE REPEATS THEN DOING SOME MILE MIL RUNS AND TESTING THERE ONCE A WEEK YOU LAID OUT A BEAUTIFUL PROGRAMME FOR HOW TO DO THAT AND THEN IN THE NEXT EPISODE YOU WOUD US AGAIN WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE SCIENCE AND THE TOOLS AND THIS WRIHT DOWN TO THE DETAILS BUT ALL LAID OUT VERY CLEANLY AND CLEARLY AS TO HOW TO DESIGN AN OPTIMO FITNESS PROGRAMM WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT REALLY REPRESENT AN OPTIMO PROGRAMM WHAT QUESTIONS DOES ONE HAVE TO ANSWER BEFORE DESINING A PROGRAMM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BARRIERS IN THE WAY THIS CONCEPT OF DEFENDERS AS THINGS THAT PREVENT YOU FROM REACHING YOUR GOALS AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME IM THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT EPISODES WAS THIS QUADRAN IM APPROACH OF REALLY THINKING ABOUT AND FIGURING OUT HOW MUCH ONE INTENDS TO DEVOTE TO WORK CAREER CALLING LET'S MAKE THAT ONE BEEN IM RELATIONSHIPS ANOTHER BEEN FITNESS IN THE OTHER BEEN AND RECOVERY IN THE OTHER BEN AND I'M HERE WI'LL TIP OUR HATAR AURE GOOD FRIEND KENNY CANE UM FOR IM MENTIONING THAT OVER ALL AM SCHEME FOR DOING THINGS BEEN IMMENSELY USEFUL AND I'VE ACTUALLY TRARTED IT OUT AND THOUGHT ABOUT AND DRAWN OUT WHICH DIFFERENT THINGS FALL IN TOEACH OF THESE CATEGORIES YOU MIY THINK IT'S OBVIOUS LIKE AT RELATIONSHIPS BUT THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF DIFFEREN THINGS AND THERE'S CROSS OVER BETWEEN THESE BENS UM TERMS OF HOW YOU CAN COMFINE ENHANCING RELATIONSHIPS WITH FITNESS WORK RECOVERY AND SO ON SO THAT EPISODE IS JUST AGAIN A TREASURE TROVE OF KNOWLEDGE AND THEN IN THE NEXT EPISODE YOU YOU EDUCATE US ON RECOVERY IN ALL ITS FORMS N THE VERY SHORT TERM IN WITHIN THE WORK OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WORK OUT AND FROM WORK OUT TO WORK OUT WASTE TO REALLY ACCELERATE RECOVERY ASCESS RECOVERY AND AS YOU POINTED OUT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ALWAYS ASSUME THAT WE DON'T RECOVER VERY WELL IN THAT SOME SORT OF CHARACTER TRAIT A NERVOUS SYSTEM THING OR JENETIC TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW MY TRAINING IS INPACTING MY LEVEL OF RECOVERY AND IN DOING SO WAYS REVEAL TO ME THAT I HAVE FAR MORE CAPACITY THAN I THOUGHT I HAD AND ALREADY THIS WEEK I'VE MANAGED TO TRAIN MORE OFTEN DOING MORE WORK AND I FEEL BETTER THAN EVER UM AND THAT'S ALSO DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'VE  SPENT A AFFAIR MOUNT OF TIME IN THESE CHAIRS ACROSS FROM ONE ANOTHER THE KIND LE I SAY AH IT'S IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE AND THEN IN TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU EXPLAINE NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION AS IT RELATES TO PERFORMANCE AND OF COURSE TAT TOUCHES INTO RECOVERY BUT ALSO OPTIBLE MENTAL STATES FOR TRAINING HOW TO APPROACH ONE'S TRAINING AND HOW TO EXTRACT THE MOST FROM TRAINING THROUGH QUALITY NUTRITION  TO WHAT TO EAT AND WHEN WHICH CARBOHYDRATES PROATINE AMOUNTS WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY AM WINDOWS YOU ABSOLUTLE DON'T WANT TO MISS AND THEN SOME THAT ARE A BIT MORE FLEXIBLE AND THEN WE WENT DEEP INTO THE WEEDS OF MAGNESIUM GARLIC TARCARY EXTRACT ALPHAG P C WE TOUCH ON NERL TRANSMIT A RELATED SYSTEMS HORMONE RELATED SYSTEMS WE WENT DEEP INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT SLEEP BECAUSE OF COURSE SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION FOR RECOVERY IN PERFORMANCE OF ALL KINDS EMOTIONAL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL RECOVERY IN PERFORMANCE AND IN TAKING US THROUGH THIS ENORMOUS ARC OF A JOURNY THROUGH FITNESS ITHING IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US YOUR KNOWLEDGE CONTAINED IN YOUR HEAD I WAS TELLING SOME ONE I JUST THE OTHER DAY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS LAMENTED INSCIENCE IS THAT I WOULD ENCOUNTER THESE INCREDIBLE PROFESSORS AND SCIENTISTS AND IN OTHER DOMAINS OF LIFE TOO AND YOU JUST WISH THERE WAS SOME WAY TO DOWNLOAD THEIR BRAIN BECAUSE THEY'D SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE INSCIDE THEM AND U'M I'M LOOKING FOR A YOUESBE OR YUSP C A PORT ON YOU AND I DON'T SEE ONE YET BUT WHAT YOU'VE EFFECTUVALLY DONE FOR US ACROSS THESE SIX EPISODES IS TO DOWN LOAD THE ACTIONABLE KNOWLEDGE AND YOU KNOW IT'S WONDERFUL THE INFORMAT IYOU'VE PROVIDED IS CLEAR IT'S SUPER INTERESTING IT'S HIGHLY HIGHLY ACTIONABLE AND IN MANY CASES IT'S COUNTER INTUITIVE AND SURPRISING BUT ONCE ONE UNDERSTANDS THE LOGIC BEHIND IT AS YOU'VE PROVIDED FOR US ALSO AND IT ALL MAKE SENSE IN A WAY THAT'S EXTREMELY SATISFYING AND EXTREMELY MODTIVATING SO IT'S CERTAINLY MOTIVATING ME TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT I TRAIN IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AND I PROMISE THAT I'LL REPORT BACK TO OUR AUDIENCE AND TO YOU AS TO WHAT MY RESULTS ARE BUT REALLY AS WE BOTH AGREE THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE PEOPLE LISTENING AND SO FOR THOSE OF YOU LISTENING I I HOPE YOU CAN APPRECIATE WHAT AN INCREDIBLE GIFT IT IS TO HAVE SOMEBODY OF DOCTOR ANY GALOPINS EXPERIENCE AND UM DRIVE AND A SCHOLARLY BACKGROUND WHO ALSO WORKS WITH ATHLETES IN EVERY DAY PEOPLE JUST TO SPLAY OUT ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE FOR US SYSTEMATICALLY OVER SIX EPISODES DOCTOR AND YALPAN THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT FAR TOO KIND OF A WORDS TO ME THERE

LIST GET YOUR PEN AND PAD OUT PLEASE I NUMBER ONE I WANT TO REALLY EMPHASIZE SCIENCE ITSELF IS A VERB WHICH MEANS IT'S ON GOING IN CHANGING I I DID MY BEST OVERE THE COURSE OFTHESE MANY MANY MANY HOURS TO  PROVIDE MY INTERPRETATION OF THE SCIENS TO PROVIDE MY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AN THINGS THAT I USE BUT THAT'S FALLIBLE SCIENCE CHANGES THERE'RE MANY MANY THINGS IN MY CAREER THAT I WAS VERY SURE THEY ARE THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS CLEAR ON AND THEN IT CHANGED SO AS YOU MOVE FORWARD DO NOT THINK OF ANY THE RECOMMENDATIONS I GAVE YOU WHETHER THEY WERE ABOUT SOPPLEMENT DOSAGES IN TIMEING RAP RANGE IS OR BREATHING TACTICS ANYTHING BETWEEN JUST USE THEM AS GUIDELINES SO NUMBER ONE SCIENCE IS AVERB NMBER TWO I REALLY WANT TO THINK THE AUDIENCE THIS HAS BEEN AN EXTREMELY LONG HAUL AS SOME OF YOU

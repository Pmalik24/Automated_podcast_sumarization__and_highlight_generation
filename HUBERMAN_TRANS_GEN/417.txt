PREMIUM PODCAST SUBSCRIBERS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES OR SO OF THIS EPISODE AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL ALLOW YUE TO DISCERN WHETHER NOT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BECOME A PREMIUM SUBSCRIBER WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S GET TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS AND AS ALWAYS I WILL STRIVE TO BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE AND YET AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE OUR FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT MOTIVATION IN PARTICULAR HOW TO MAINTAIN MOTIVATION OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME THIS WAS A QUESTION ASKED BY MARTIN ZO COV HE WROTE I ALTERNATE BETWEEN PERIODS OF TWO DIFFERENT STATES THAT VARY FROM A FEW WEEKS TO A COUPLE OF MONTHS I HAVE EXTREMELY HIGH MOTIVATION IN ONE STATE WHERE I CAN DO MULTIPLE THINGS SIDE PROJECTS MAKING MUSIC AS WELL AS MY MAIN THINGS OR REALLY LOW MOTIVATIONAL STATES WHERE I CAN BARELY DO ANYTHING AND I ONLY LOOK FOR SHORT TERM ENTERTAINMENT A'M GUESSING SHORT TERM ENTERTAINMENT COMES IN THE FORM OF VIDEW GAME SOCIAL MEDIA AT IS KAND OF DOING GENERALLY UNPRODUCTIVE THINGS AS WE ALL DO FROM TIME TO TIME HE GOES ON TO WRIGT WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST SET OF PROTOCALS TO NORMALIZE THOSE EXTREMES INTO A MORE STABLE AND CONSISTENT STATE WHEL FIRST OFF THIS IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I SAY THAT BECAUSES IT'S A QUESTION THAT I HEAR A LOT AND I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE ORE INTERESTED IN KNOWING HOW MOTIVADED THEY OUGHT TO FEEL AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ALSO FEEL LOT LESS MOTIVATED THAN THEY WOULD LIKE OW HERE THE QUESTION WAS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW TO NOT GO FROM THESE EXTREMES OF DAYS OR WEEKS OF HIGH MOTIVATION TO DAYS OR WEEKS OF LOW MOTIVATION BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK IN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT JUST AS WITH ANXIETY OR HAPPINESS OR SADNESS WE IS HUMAN BEINGS DON'T HAVE AN OBJECTIVE WINDOW INTO HOW OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCE MOTIVATION IN FACT MOST THE TIME WE DON'T EVEN REALIZE HOW WE EXPERIENCE MOTIVATION WE JUST KNOW WHETHER NOT WE FEEL A HIGH BARRIER OR A LOW BARRIER TO LEANING INTO WORK IN GETTING THINGS DONE IN FACT HAVE A GOOD FRIEND WHO DID MANY YEARS IN THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMUNITY AND THEN WENT ON TO THE FINANCE COMMUNITY AND THEN NOW WORKS IN HEALTH AND WELLNESS COMMUNITY IS A GREAT AN A MENTAL IMAGE FOR ALL OF US TO ADOPT IS CERTAINLY ONE THAT IAVE ADOPTED WHICH IS FOR ANYTHING IN OUR LIFE WE CAN EITHER BE BACK ON OUR HEELS FLATFOOTED OR FORWARD CENTERE OF MASS BACK IN OUR HEELS MEANING REALLY STRUGGLING FLATFOOT AN MEANING THEN WE'RE DOING OQE OR FORWARD CENTER OF MASS MEING THAT WE WE FEEL AS IF WERE REALLY TACKLING THINGS AND THAT WE ARE IN CONTROL OF OUR ENVIRONMENT OR AT LEAST TO SOME DEGREE IN USO I PLACE THAT IMAGERY IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE ALL RETURN TO IT ELOMIT LATER IN THE QUESTION WHEN WE GET INTO SOME OF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUITRY IN TOOLS IN THE MEANTIME WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY WHAT THE BASIS OF MOTIVATION IS THERE ARE MANY NAUROW CHEMICALS IN NURL CIRCUITS INVOLVED IN WHAT WE CALL MOTIVATION BUT ECENSIAL THEME OF THE NAURO SCIENCE OF MOTIVATION IS THAT THE NEUROMODULATEOR DOPAMINE IS INVOLVED A DOPOMINE DOES OTHER THINGS BESIDES CONTROL MOTIVATION OF ACTING CONTROLS LIGHT ADAPTATION IN THE RETNA A THAT IS YOUR EYE IT CONTROLS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN TERMS OF MOVEMENT IT CONTROLS ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT IT IS STRONGLY RELATED TO THE MOTIVATION PATHWAYS HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WELL THEIRE EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS IN HUMANS WHICH SHOW THAT EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF DOPAOMINE OR IN THE PRESENCE A VERY LOW DOPAMNE I SHOULD SAY PEOPLE AND ANIMALS CAN STILL EXPERIENCE PLEASURE HOWEVER WHEN DOPOMINE LEVELS ARE TOO LOW PEOPLES A BILITY TO PURSUE PLEASURE OR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PURSUE PLEASURE IN PARTICULAR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO UNDERGO EFFORT TO PURSUE PLEASURE OR ANY GOAL OF ANY KIND NOT JUST PLEASURE ANY GOAL OF ANY KIND IS STRONGLY REGULATED BY THE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE SO DOPOMINE LEVELS ARE TOO LOW PEOPLE SIMPLY WILL NOT PUT IN THE EFFORT TO OBTAIN OR REACH A GOAL IF DOPOMINE LEVELS ARE ADEQUATELY HIGH THEY WILL PUT IN THAT EFFORT AND IF DOPOMINE LEVELS GO TOO HIGH YOU ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING THAT IS PATOLOGIC WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE CONSIDER EVERY GOAL A REASONABLE GOAL THIS IS OFTEN SEEN IN THE MANIC PHASE OF A MANIC BY POLAR PERSON SO FOR INSTANCE SOMEBODY WITH MANIC BY POLAR WHOSE IN THE MANIC EPISODE DOPOMIN LEVELS ARE VERY VERY HIGH AND THEY WILL THINK EVERY IDEAS A GREAT IDEA AND THEYWILL HAVE TONS OF ENERGY TO DO THAT SO MUCH SO SO THAT THEY'RE NOT SLEEPING SO OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT WHAT WE WANT IN WHAT THE QUESTION ASKER MARTIN IS ASKING ABOUT IS HOW TO KEEP DOPAMINE LEVELS IN A RANGE THAT ALLOW US TO LEAN INTO EFFORT BUT THAT WE DON'T EXPEND OUR ABILITY TO STAY MOTIVATED AND WE CAN REALLY TRACE THAT BACK TO A BIO CHEMICAL SLASH NURL CIRCUIT STATEMENT WHICH IS WE REALLY WANT TO CONTROL OUR OUTPUT OF DOPAMINE AND THE BASE LINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE FROM WHICH THAT OUTPUT IS TAKEN IN OTHER WORDS WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT DOPAMINE AS A RESERVOIR OR RESIDING IN A RESERVOIR THAT RESERVOIR CAN BE DEPLEATED SO IT'S EXHAUSTIBLE IT'S  DEPLEATABLE BUT IT'S RENEWABLE SOEL AND ONE OF THE BEST ANALOGIES THAT I'VE EVER HEARD WAS BY A PREVIOUS GUESSED ON THE HUBOMAN LABPODCAST DOCTOR CILE GELETT THOS A MEDICAL DOCTOR OBISITY SPECIALISTS EXPERT IN HORMONES WE DID A EPISODE ON OPTIMIZING HORMONES AND MALS WITH DOCTOR CALGELETT YOU CAN FIND THAT AT HUBERMAN LAVDOT COM OR ANYWHERE YOU CAN FIND PODCAST DOCTOR GELETTE OFFERED AN ANALOGY OF THE BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AS A WAVEPOOL AND I REALLY LIKE THIS SO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS POOL FUL OF DOPAMINE AND HERE WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE DOPAMINE THAT RESIDES IN THE CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL MOTIVATION BUT THAT POOL OF DOPAMINE YOU CAN IMAGINE IS JUST SITTING THERE NOT DOING MUCH OF ANYTHING WHILE YOU'RE A SLEEP IN FACT WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING YOURE REPLENISHING THOSE DOPAMINE LEVELS I'LL ELL YOU ANOTHER TOOL IN A MOMENT TO REPLENISH THOSE DOPAMINE LEVELS BUT IF YOU WERE TO PURSO OF GOAL REALLY REALLY GO FORWARD CENTERE OF MASS FOR MANY MANY HOURS ARE MANY MANY DAYS IN SOME CASES AND PURSUA GOAL ARE MULTIBL GOALS ANDYOU REALLY DRIVEN TO DO A TON WHAT YOUR EFFECTIVELY DOING IS GENERATING WAVES IN THAT WAVEPOOL AND IF THOSE WAVES ARE TOO BIG WELL THEN THE WAVES CAN'T KEEP REPEATING THEMSELVES SO THINK OF THOUT THE WAVE IS THE MOTIVATION AND THE DEPTH OF THE POOL IS THE RESERVOIR OF DOPAMINE AND IF THOSE WAVES ARE TOO BIG TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT TOO MUCH MOTIVATION TOO MUCH CENTER OF MASS FOR A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME THEN THE WATER IN THIS WAVE WILL SLOSHIS OUT OF THE WAVE POOL LOWERING IN THE RESERVOIR AND THEN THERRE REALLY THREE WAVS THAT YOU CAN REPLENISH THAT RESERVOIR AND YOU WANT O MAINTAIN OR REPLENISH THAT RESERVOIR IF IT'S BEEN DEPLETED HOW DO YOU DO THAT WELL FIRST OF ALL QUALITY SLEEP SO WHEN I SAY QUALITY I MEAN WHERE YOU'RE GTTING ENOUGH SLOWAY SLEEP IN RAP AND I MOVEENT SLEEP SO FOR SOME PEOPLE SIX HOURS FOR SOME PEOPLE EIGHT HOURS ON PEOPLE MIGHT EVEN NEED A LO BIT MORE LOBIT LESS WE HAVE EPISODES THE PROFECT YOUR SLEEP EPISODE THE MASTER SLEEP EPISODE WE HAVE A TOO KIP FOR SLEEP ALL AVAILABLE AS YOUR COST TO HURMN LABDOT COM LINKS ET CETERA TO CHECK THOSE OUT FOR GETTING YOUR SLEE RIGHT BUT SLEEP IS REALLY WHEN YOU REPLENISH THAT RESERVOIR OF DOPAMIE SO YOU CAN NOT IGNORE SLEEP I'LL COME BACK TO THIS IN A MOMENT THE SECOND SCIENCE SUPPORTED TOOL THAT'S REALLY BEEN SHOWN TO REPLENISH DOPAMINE IN PARTICULAR DOPAMINE WITHIN THE PATHWAYS THAT REGULATE MOTIVATION IS A PRACTICE I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THE PODCAST CALLED NON SLEEP DEEP REST SOMETIMES CALLED YEOGANEDRA ALTHOUGH YEOGANEDRA IS A LITLE BIT DIFFERENT THERE TOO STUDIES OUT OF DENMARK THAT HAVE EXPLORED YEOGENEDRA IN THE CONTEXT OF DOPAMINE THE FIRST ONE SIMPLY INVOLVED HAVING PEOPLE DO A YEOGENEDROPACTICE AGAIN THIS DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY MOVEMENT BUT INVOLVES PEOPLE POTENTIALLY YOU DOING ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NOW DATA SHOWING THAT IS SHORT AS TEN MINUTES OF A NON SLEEP DEEP REAST A C YEOGENEDROPROTOCALL LEADS TO DRAMATIC REALLY DRAMATIC INCREASES IN STRYETALD DOPAMINE RESERVES SO IT ESSENTIALLY IS REPLENISHING THE DOPAMINE RESERVEPOOL THIS IS WHY IA'M SUCH A FAN OF USING ENESTYAR A K YOGANEDRA AT LEAST ONE TO DAY AND A S ESI UNDER TIMES WHEN YOUARE ENGAGING IN A LOT OF HIGH OUTPUT AND WHEN I THINK ESPECIALLY AT TIMES WHEN YOU'R ENGAGING A LOT OF HIGH OUTPUT THIS IS A MISTAKE MANY PEOPLE MAKE THEY PUSHPUSH PUSHPUSH PUSH THERE IN PURSUIT OF A GOAL THEN THEY HIT THAT POINT WHERE THEY'RE EXHAUSTED THEN THEY STAR DOING ALL THE DOPOMINE RESERVE POOL REPLENISHING TOOLS SUCH AS YOGANEDRAR N ESTIAR THE REAL KEY IS TO ALWAYS TAP OFF THAT OR REFILL THAT RESERVOIR ONCE A DAY BEFORE IT'S COMPLETELY DEPLETED NOW THIS GETS INTO SOME OF THE BILE CHEMISTRY OF DOPOMINE AND THE RELEVANT CIRCUITS BUT IT TAKES A LOT LONGER TO RESTORE THE DOPOMINE RESERVOIR THINK OF IT STILL AS A WAVEPOOL BUT THAT RESERVOIR FROM A PLACE OF COMPLETE DEPLETION THEN IT DOES OF PARTIAL DEPLETION SO THERE'S ANA CYMETERY IN THE WAY THIS IS DONE SO IT'S NOT AS IF YOU KNOW YOU DRINK A GLASS WATER YOU FILL THE GLASS WATER A CERTAIN RATE AND IT FILLS UP TO A CERTAIN LEVEL AND THE RATIS CONSTANT THINK ABOUT IT AS ONCE THE LEVEL OF DOPOMINE IN YOUR RESERVE IS TEPLEADED PAST A CERTAIN POINT IT TAKES A LOT MORE EFFORT MUCH MORE SLEEP MUCH MORE NSTIAR THINGS OF THAT SORT TO REPLENISH THAT RESERVOIR NOW OFTENTIMES WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO WHEN THEY START FEELING LESS MOTIVATION IS THEY WILL START RELYING ON THINGS LIKE ATARALL RIDDLIN SOME CASES ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES THAT A CAN INCREASED DOPOMINE YOU KNO WHAT THOSE AR PLEASE DON'T A EVER LEAN TO THOSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY A DANGEROUS THEY REALLY AR BECAUSE OF THEIRE ABILITY TO POTENTLY RELEASED DOPOMINE AND GUESS WHAT TO PLETE THAT RESERVOIR EVEN FURTHER WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME SUPPLEMENTS ON THE PODCASTS THAT CAN REPLENISHD DOPOMINE ALL TYRICINE AND PARTICULAR A MCUNOPURINS IS ACTING NINETY NINE PERCENT AL DOPA THE PRECURSOR TO DOPOMNE I DON'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND A MCUNOPURIANS IT TENDS TO MAKE PEOPLE A VERY DOPOMAN URGIT DRIDRIDRIDRIVD MOTIVATED AND THEN CRASH AGAIN DEPLEADING THAT POOL I ELLTIRSINSELOBIT MILDER BUT I REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LEAN FIRST ON THE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS SUCH AS AN ESTR BY THE WAY THEREIS A NESTAR SCRIPT TOTALLESRO COSTS THAT YOU CAN FIND BY A PUTTING MY NAME AND NESTIAR INTO YOU TOB A THAT ONE A WORKS QUITE WELL IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SHORT AN ESTIAR A THERE'S SOME OTHER ENESTIARS YOU CAN SIMPLY LOOK ON THE ANERNET A OR YOU TUBAN JUST PUT N STIAR ANIAL FINE N ESTIAR OR IF YOU PREFER TO DO THE MORE CLASSIC YEOGANEDOR TYPE APPROACH THER'RE A LOT OF DIFFENT YOGANEDR OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM ON YOU TO MANY PEOPLE THINK NESTIAR OR YOGANEDR ARE SIMPLY MEDITATION WITH A BODY SCAN THAT'S NOT TRUE MEDITATION IS A FOCUS EXERCISE AN MOST MEDITATIONS ARE FOCUS EXERCISE NESTIAR RESTORES ENERGY THROUGH THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM AND NEWER DATE AUR STRING TO SHOW THAT CAN ACTUALLY RECOVER LOST SLEEPS IF YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING ENOUGH BUT TO RETURN TO N ESTIAR A K YEOGANEGER AS A PRACTICE YES IT'S BEEN SHOWN IN LABORATORY STUDIES INHUMANS BY THE WAY TO RESTORE DOPOMINE LEVELS THERE'S ANOTHER STUDY LESS ER KNOWN FROM T THAT SAME GROUP THAT WAS PUBLISHING TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHICH IS ENTITLED DOPOMIN URGIC STIMULATION ENHANCES CONFIDENCE AND ACCURACY IN SEEING RAPIDLY PRESENTED WORDS THIS WAS A COGNIVE TASK THEY EXPLORED YOGANEDRA A K AND ESTY ARE IN THE CONTEXTS OF INCREASING STRIDAL DOPOMING THEY ALREADY KNEW THAT IT DID THAT SO THAT'S GREAT THEY CONFIRM THAT RESULT BUT WHAT THEY ALSO FOUND IS THAT DOING AND ESTIAR COULD RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN COGNATIV ABILITY AND PERFORMANCE IN THESE COGNAVE TASKS ET SO THIS IS A REALLY POWERFUL ZERO COST TOOL FOR RE UPPING OR REPLENISHING THAT DOPOMINE RESERVE YE SO THIS IS SOMETHING TO DO EVERY DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT FEELING TO PLEADED SO THE QUESTION AGAIN WAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T GO THROUGH THESE CYCLES OF EXSTREME MOTIVATION AND THEN LESSER MOTIVATION WELL GET YOUR SLEEPRIGHT I WOUL SAY EIGHTY PER CENT OR MORE OF THE NIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE HOPEULLY THE NIGHTS THAT ET'S NOT GOOD FOR GOOD REASONS THAT YOU'RE NJOYING YOURSELF BUT A LIFE HAPPENS SO YOU KOW HUNDER PER CENT OF THE TIME IS JUST NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT OF YOURSELF DO AN STY ARE ONCE A DAY FOR EITHER TEN MINUTES IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TO DO TWENTY THIRTY MINUTES OR AN HOUR YOU WILL SEE EVEN MORE POSITIVE EFFECTS IT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THESE RESEARCH STUDIES TO REPLENISH DOPOMINE LEVELS OF CONFIDENCE COGNIVABILITY ET CETERA AND SENSE OF MOTIVATION AND I SAID THERE WERE THREE TOOLS AND THE THIRD TOOL THAT REALLY CAN ALLOW YOU TO KEEP THE DOPOMINE A K MOTIVATION CIRCUITRY TONED UP PROPERLY IS TO REALLY START PAYING ATTENTION TO PIKS IN DOPOMINE AND BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT LAYERING IN TOO MANY THINGS THAT CAN STIMULATE THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM I TALKED ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT IN THE EPISOD TAT WE DID ON EIGHTY HTY AND BUILDING AND MAINTAINING FOCUS THERE ARE MANY THINGS OUT THERE NOWADAYS THAT WE'LL DEPLETE THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE AND BY THE WAY NONE OF WHAT I'M ABOUT TO LIST IS NECESSARILY BAD I ACTUALLY USE SOME OF THESE THINGS FOR INSTANCE KAFFINE WILL INCREASE DOPOMINE RECEPTERS THAT WI'LL LOW WHATEVER DOPOMINE IS AVAILABLE TO BE MORE POTENT O KASO KAFFINE'S GREATE FOR SOME PEOPLE LESS GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DON'T DR GIT TO LATEIN THE DAY CLL INTERFERE WITH YOUR SLEEP AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT MANY PEOPLE WILL COMBINE KAFFINE WITH MUSIC THAT THEY PARTICULAR LIKE MUSIC SCRAPE MUSIC CAN STIMULATE DOPOMINE RELEASE WE KNOW THIS IT CAN ENHANDSOME MOTIVATION ESPECIALY OF ITS KIND OF MUSIC THAT REALLY PUTS YOU IN THE GROUP FOR THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF WORK YOU'RE GOING TO DO FOR ME I LIKE TO LISTEN TO EITHER LOUDFAST MUSIC OR GLENGOULD CLASSICAL PIANO SO ONE OR THE OTHER I KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ME FOR A GIVEN TIME YOU'LL KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU FOR GIVEN TIME IN YOUR PREFERENCES BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN AS PEOPLE WILL START CONSUMING KAFFINE AT HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS AGAIN KAFFINE ISN'T NECARILY BAD BUT THEY'LL TART DOING THAT AND THEY'LL START LAYERID IN OR STACKING VERY POTENT MUSIC POTENT FOR THEM PLUS THINGS LIKE ALL TYRISINE AGAIN NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE TERRIBLE ON THEIR OWN FACT THEY CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL SOMETIMES THEY'LL START TAKING MACUNO PURINE SOMETIMES THEYLL START RELYING ON THINGS LIKE ATER ALL RIDDLIN AND PRETTY SOON WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE GETTING THESE BIG WAVES IN THAT DOPAMINE WAVE WILL BIG PEAKS AND WITHIN A FEW DAYS OR MAYBE EVEN WITHIN A FEW HOURS THEY'RE TEPLEEATED AND THERE AT THAT LO AND THEN AS DOCTOR ONOLEMPKI WHO AS A GUEST ON THE PODCAST TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF A DICTION BUT ALSO IN HER WONDERFUL BUT DOPAMI NATION WHAT A HAPPENS IS AFTER THOSE BIG PEAKS IN DOPAMNE THE RESERVOIR THE BASE LINE IN DOPAMINE DROPS BELO IT'S INITIAL LEVEL SO IT'S AS IF THE RESERVIR GOT DEEPER AND IT'S EMPTIER AND IT TAKES MUCH MUCH LONGER TO FILL CSO TO BE QUITE SPECIFIC WHAT I'M RECOMMENDING IS GET YOUR SLEEP RIGHT I DEALLY EVERY NIGHT TO YOUR LIFE BUT FOR AS MANY NIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE AS POSSIBLE THAT'S CLEARLY REPLENISHING DOPAMINE AND SENSE OF MOTIVATION DO ALL THE THINGS ASSOCIATE WITH THAT MORNING SUNLIGHT LACK OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AT CERTAIN HOURS OF THE NIGHT ET CETERA ALL OF THAT'S IN THE TWOILL GET FOR SLEEP ANOTHER EPISODES I MENTION BEFORE HAVE A PRACTICE THAT IS RESEARCH SUPPORTED TO REPLENISH DOPAMINE AND INCORPORATE THAT PRACTICE ANY TIME OF DAY AGAIN AND AS TEAR CAN BE DONE MORNING AFTERNOON OR EVENING OR MIDDLE THE NIGHT IF YOU WAKE UP AN YOU NEED TO GET BACK TO SLEEP IT CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THAT BUT DO IT AS A CONSISTENT PRACTICE SO THAT DOPAMINE RESERVOAR REMAINS TAPPED OFF AND AS A THIRD POINT PLEASE BE WEARY OF OR AT LEAST AWARE OF THESE PEAKS AND DOPAMINE AN THE FACT THAT LAYRING IN A LOT OF THINGS THAT STIMULATE DOPAMINE WHILE THAT CAN BE WONDERFUL FOR YOUR WEDDING A BIRTH OF A NEW CHILD GOING TO A SPORTS EVENT WITH A BUNCH OF FRIEND CELEBRATING A BIG ANNIVERSARY YES PLEASE DO CELEBRATE AND ENJOY THE WONDERFUL EVENTS OF LIFE BUT PLEASE ALSO UNDERSTAND AND EXPECT THERE WILL BE A LULL A SORT OF POSTPARDOM LO MAY BE NOT FUL BLOWN DEPRESSION THAT FOLLOWS THAT UNLESS YOU INCORPORATE SOME TOOLS AND PRACTICES TO REPLENISH THAT DOPAMINE DOES THAT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER COMBINE CAFINAL TYRASINE MUSIC AND A WORK OUT IN TIME WITH FRIENDS NO ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT DON'T EXPECT TO DO THAT AND THEN GO DOAN INTENSE BOUT OF WORK AND THEN GET UP THE NEXT MORNING AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS BEFORE YOU FIND YOURSELF PRETTY TO PLEADED O KAS SO RATHER THAN GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC SCHEDULE OF YOU DON'T DO SEVEN DAYS OF THIS AND FOR DAYS OF THIS WHAT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO IS FOR AT LEAST FIVE DAYS A WEEK MAYBE GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME OFF ON THE WEEKENS MAY BE NOT BUT IT FOR AT LEAST FIVE DAYS A WEEK GET INTO A CONSISTENT ROUTINE THAT IS I SHOULD SAY NUROBIOLOGICALLY CONSISTENT AS WELL WITH HOW THE DOPAMINE ACH A CIRCUITS THE CONTROL MOTIVATION WORK AND I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN A MORE REGULAR GROOVE OF FOCUS AND ATTENTION AND ALERTNESS AND MOTIVATION WHEN YOU NEED TO AND PROVIDED YOUARE DOING ALL THE THINGS I DESCRIBED AND HOPEFULLY PAING ATTENTION OTHER THINGS LIKE NUTRITION AND SOCIAL CONNECTION TOO OF COURSE YOU'LL FIND A MUCH MORE EVEN PATTERN OF MOTIVATION OVER TIME ONE LAST THING BEFORE I CONCLUDE THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESSION WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL I GOT SOME WONDERFUL ADVICE FROM IN EXCELLENT NEROLOGISTS IS AME AS ROBERT NIGHT HE'S TO BE AT UNIVERSY CALFORNIA BERKLY I THINK HE'S RETIRED NOW BUT AM IS STILL ACTIVE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND I ASKED HIM AH WHAT HE WAS DOING THAT WE CAN I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS CAME UP ANDHE S I'M GOING FISHING I LIKE KIND OF YOUNOT MINDLESS RECREATION UNSO IT'S GREAT YOUNG FISHING'S FONA NOT PARTICULARLY A IN TO FISHING MYSELF BUT I'VE DONE A FEW TIMES AN I ENJOY IT AND HE SAID YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR A SCIENCE OR MEDICINE CAREER OR ANY DEMANDING CAREER I SAID WHAT I HOS ALL YEARIS A SUPERYOU KNOW SUPERHUNGRY TO TO GET IN THE MIXON YOU'VE DO RE SEARCH IN PUBLISHD PAPERS AND HE SAID FIGURE OUT HOW MANY HOURS A DAY YOU CAN DO REAL WORK CONSISTENTLY THAT MEANS FIVE DAYS A WEEK FOR SOME PEOPLE SIX OR SEVEN BUT FIVE DAYS A WEEK I THINK FOR MOST EOPLE IS GIN TO BE OF IT HEALTHIER OVER ALL FOR YOUR SOCIAL LIFE AND FAMILY ET CETERA AND HE SAID FIGURE THAT OUT AND KNOW THAT THAT NUMBER IS WHAT YOU SHOULD APPLY OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT UP DATE THAT NUMBER ABOUT EVERY FOR OR FIVE YEARS AND I SAID O CSE SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT OVER TIME I'M WORKING MORE AND MORE OR LESS AND LESS AND HE SAID AH HERE'S THE DEAL AS YOU GET BETTER AT YOUR PROFESSION YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU CAN DO MORE POTENT WORK MORE DIRECTED WORK IN A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU'RE OING FOCUS WORK IN FACT THE OPPOSIT SO THIS FOLLOWS A SORT OF GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT'S ALSO PRESENT IN RESISTENCE TRAINING THER WAIT LIFTING RIGHT I'M THE ANALOGY THERE IS THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS IMAGINE THAT AS YOU GET BETTER AND BETTER AT RESISTANCE TRAIN THA YOU SHOULD DO MORE AND MORE VOLUME JUST KEEP ADTING VOLUME ANDY OTHER SOME EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT MORE VOLUME FOR HYPERTROPHY AS POSE LESS ET CETERA WE'VE DONE EPISODES ON THIS HOWEVER THERE'S A DIFFERENT SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT WORKS EXCEEDINGLY WELL AND IT RUNS IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHICH IS AS YOU GET BETTER AT CONTROLLING MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS OR LET' SAY FOR AN AN ENDURANCE SPORT AS YOU GET BETTER AT REGULATING YOUR STRIDE AND BREATHING AN ALL THOSE THINGS YOU ACTUALLY CAN DO MORE QUOTE AND QUOTE ADAPTATION STIMULATING DAMAGE DURING A GIVEN TRAINING SESSION SO YOU WANT A TRAIN LESS NOT MORE OVER TIME BECAUSE BEGINNERS DON'T ACTUALY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET MUCH DONE IN A LOT OF TIME OR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE'RE AS EXPERTS CAN COME IN THERE AND REALLY NAIL IT SO I THINK I'D ADVICE THAT ROBERT NIGHT WAS REALLY KEY AND IT SOMETHING THAT'VE FOLLOWEDTHROUGHOUT MY CAREER SO IT ONE PERIOD OF MY LIFE I WON'T MENTION THE HOURS THAT I WORKED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL THEY WERE PRETTY INSANE TO BE HONEST I'D FAMILY MEMBERS GET A LOLL CONCERN ACTUALLY LIVED IN THE LABORATORY EVEN AS A JUNIOR PROFESSOR I DON'T SUGGEST PEOPLE DO THAT BY THE WAY BUT I ENJOYED IT AT THE TIME AND THE KEY THING IS THAT YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU CAN DO CONSISTENTLY AND STILL MAINTAIN MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HALTH THAT'S KEY AS WELL AND DO THAT AND THEN EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS ARE SO UPDATE THAT TYPICALLY BY REDUCING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT HIGH POTENT SEY WORK I THINK THAT COMBIND WITH THE OTHER TOOLS THAT I DESCRIBE BEFORE FOR GENERATING ON GOING TOPEMANURGIC CIRCUITS KEEPING THAT RESERVOIR FULL OUGHT TO GIVE YOU CONSISTENT MOTIVATION AGAIN IT'S IN ART AND A PRACTICE AND A SCIENCE SO DON'T EXPECT TO GET AT PERFECT THE FIRST TIME AROUND BUT I WISH YOU ALL LUCK AND I'M CERTAIN THAT THESE TOOLS WORK THANK YOU FOR JOINING FOR THE BEGINNING OF THIS ASK ME ANYTHING EPISODE TO HEAR THE FULL EPISODE N ND TO HEAR FUTURE EPISODES OF THESE ASK ME ANYTHING

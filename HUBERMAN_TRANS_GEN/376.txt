PLEASURE TO BE HERE FOR THIS SERIES WE'VE BEEN FOCASING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND REALLY DEFINING WHAT MENTAL HEALTH IS AND A ROAD MAP TO ACHIEVE MENTAL HEALTH AND IN EPISODE ONE YOU LAID OUT FOR US A MAP ESSENTIALLY OF THE THINGS THAT ANY IN ALL OF US CAN LOOK AT PRETTY MUCH AT ANY TIME WITH ESSENTIALLY ANY DEGREE OF RESOURCES TRY AND GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OURSELVES AND HOW WELL OR NOT WELL WE HAPPEN TO BE MOVING TOWARD WERE CREATING TRUE MENTAL HEALTH FOR OURSELVES IND ADDITION TO THAT YOU SPELLED OUT FOR US WHAT TRUE MENTAL HEALTH REALLY IS AND JUST TO RECAPITAL BIT OF THAT IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO THESE VERB STATES ACTION STATES OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IS AND THEN AN EPISODE TOO YOU COVERED SOME OF THE COMMON CHALLENGES THAT YOU'VE OBSERVED IN LIFE AND IN YOUR CLINICAL PRACTICE AND WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES BY GOING TO THE MAP OPENING THE SO CALLED CUPBOARDS AS WERE REFERRING TO THEM AND ASKING SPECIFIC SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND THEN AN EPISODE THREE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW LOOKING AT THE MAP AND EXPLORING THE MAP IN THOSE CUPBOARDS IN PARTICULAR CAN HELP PEOPLE IN RELATIONAL ASPECTS OF LIFE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WORK RELATIONSHIPS FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO SELF YES VERY IMPORTANT VERY IMPORTANT THE FOUNDATION OF ALL RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE OF OURSELVES AND I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU HIGH LIGHTED THE RELATIONSHIP TO SELF BECAUSE TO DAY'S EPISODE WE WILL OF COURSE RETURN TO THE MAP AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE NOT SEEN EPISODES ONE TWO OR THREE THAT'S O QUE TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL BE ENTIRELY ACCESSIBLE TO THEM BUT I DO RECOMMEND THAT AT SOME POINT THEY ESPECIALLY LISTEN TO EPISODE ONE AND HOPEFULLY EPISODES TOO AND THREE AS WELL BUT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS REALLY ABOUT THE ASPECTS OF OURSELVES THAT EXIST IN ALL PEOPLE AND THE ACTION STEPS THE PATHS OF INQUIRY THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL PEOPLE THAT CAN ALLOW ANY ONE IN EVERYONE TO IMPROVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH TO MOVE TOWARD THESE IDEALS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ON A REGULAR BASIS YES AND AS YOU POINT OUT IT IS A PROCESS IT'S NOT THAT WE ARRIVE AT AGENCY IN GRATITUDE AND JUST TO REITERATE AGENCY IN GRATITUDE OUR VERB STATES THEY INVOLVE WAYS OF BEING IN THE WORLD THEIR ACTIVE PROCES S IS LIKE LIFE IS AN ACTIVE PROCESS RIGHT IS IT IS NOT AN END POINT WE'RE TRYING TO READ TRI WE'RE TRYING TO LIVE AND IN THINKING ABOUT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU KNOW IT CURRED TO BOTH OF US REALLY THAT TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS REALLY ABOUT SELF CARE YOU W ISELF CARE AS A CONCEPT I THINK FOR MANY PEOPLE EVOKES NOTIONS OF LIKE OQUET YOU GAN TO TAKE A VACATION ORE YOU GOING TO KICK YOUR FEET UP OR A GET A MASAGE YOU NONT THINGS OF THAT SORT AND CERTAINLY IT CAN INVOLVE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BUT JUST AS IF WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT PHYSICAL HEALTH WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE PHYSICAL BODY TO ENHANCE HEALF SPAN AND LIFE SPAN TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS REALLY ABOUT HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THE INTERNAL LANDSCAPE THE MIND RIGHT WHICH ALSO QUALIFIES VERY STRONGLY AS SELF CARE YES SO IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU TELL US HOW YOU THINK ABOUT SELF CARE YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF WHEATHER NOT YOU HAVE A PATIENT WHOS DEALING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS OR SOMEBODY WHO'S JUST YOU KNOW ON HITTING THE SAME SPEED BUMPS OF LIFE OVER AND OVER AGAIN OR ANYTHING IN BETWEEN YOW WHAT SORTS OF SELF CARE PRACTICES AND MINDSETS TO YOU SUGGEST PEOPLE TAKE ON FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THAT MATTER HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT SELF CARE II THINK WE START WITH WITH FACTORS THAT AE REALLIGIOUS BASELINE FACTORS A THEY HAVE TO BE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE GOOD THINGS UPON THEM SO THE BASICS OF  NO HAVE TO BE EATING WELL ENOUGH TO FEEL OQET AND HOPEFULLY EATING REALLY WELL WE HAVE TO STAY HYDRATED WE HAVE TO GET SLEEP WE HAVE TO MOVE THE BODY IN  THESE ARE BASICS BUT BASICS A LOT OF PEOPLE OR NOT ATTENDING TO SIMILARLY WE HAVE TO BE IN A SITUATION THAT IS IT MAKING FEAR AND MISERY ALL THE TIME SO AN EXAMPLE OF AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT A PERSON IS TO BE THAS TO NAVIGATE OUT OF THAT BEFORE THEY CAN REALLY START TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES IN THE WAY THAT BUILDS GOODNESS ASO SO WE LOOK FOR THE BASIC FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF IN ORDER TO THE ND LOOK AT THE FACTORS THAT BECOME PARTICULAR TO EACH OF US AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS SELF UNDERSTANDING IGHT HOW HOW MUCH CAN WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT OURSELVES BE KNOWLEDGIBLE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US WHY IT'S GOING ON ALSO AND VERY IMPORTANTLY BEING AWARE THAT WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON INSIDE OF US AND BEING CURIOUS ABOUT THAT AND LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD AROUND US ARE DO WE FEEL HAPPY DO WE NOT FEEL HAPPY HOW DOE WE DEFINE WHAT HAPPY MEANS HOW ARE WE ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD BECAUSE AS YOUR SAYING THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ARE VERB STATE SO HOW ARE WE LIVING LIFE HOW WE ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD DO WE FEEL LIKE LIFE IS A SEQUENCE OF THINGS I HAVE TO DO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT ER WE DOING THINGS WE REALLY REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO RIGHT DO WE HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS HOW COULD LIFE BE DIFFERENT RIGHT WE START LOOKING AT OURSELVES TO TO ASSESS HOW WE'RE ENGAGING WITH OURSELVES THE PEOPLE THE WORLD AROUND US IN A WAY THAT IS EITHER GENERATIVE OR NOT GENERATIVE IF WE'RE IN THAT STATE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THEN WE ARE GIN HAVE PERIODS OF TIME WHERE WE FEEL PEACEFUL RIGHT WE FEEL SENSE OF CONTENTMENT OR WE FEEL DELIGHTED SO IS ANY OF THAT IN MY LIFE RIGHT IF NOT WHY CAN CAN I START THINKING ABOUT THAT SOMETIMES THE ANSWERS QUITE CLEAR LIKE OH THERE'S THIS THING I LOVE AND I'M NOT DOING THAT RIGHT AND AND I CAN'T DO IT AN ANY REVISIT LIKE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT ALIVETIMES IT IS NOT TRUE AND IF IT IS TRUE HOW DOES THE PERSON COME TO TERMS WITH THAT PROCESS THAT PERHAPS GRIEVE RIGHT SO SAY IF IT'S THE LOSS OF A PERSON IGHT THAT CAN KEEP PEOPLE HE KNOW IN TERRIBLE MISERY OVER YEARS AND YEARS SO THERE MAY BE THINGS WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN GET OURSELVES TO THAT PLACE OF KNOWING OURSELVES PRETTY WELL IN ENGAGING IN THE WORLD IN WAYS THAT WE AF A PRETTY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF AND THAT THAT ARE ADAPTIVE AND THEN WE LOOK TO SAY OQUETT NOW HOW DO I MAKE THAT BETTER BECAUSE NOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT PREVENTIVE MEDICE RIGHT WE WANT OUR BODIES TO BE HEALTHY BECAUSE OF COURSE WE WANT TO BE HEALTHY TO DAY RIGHT BUT WE ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IGHT WILL THERE BE AN INJURY OR IN ILLNESS I MEAN EVENTUALLY LIKE YOU KNW WE ALL OF AN INJURY OR AN ILLNESS IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER SO WE'RE PREPARING FOR THE PREDICTABLE CHALLENGES THAT WILL COME OUR WAY IN THE FUTURE AND IT WE'RE WELL SERVES BY DOING THIS ABOUT OUR MENTAL HEALTH TOO RIGHT THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES THAT COME OUR WAY THERE'LL BE LOSSES AND STRESSERS AND THINGS THAT MAKE US FEEL BAD OR FEEL SCARE AND TTHESE THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO SO THO HEALTHIOR WE ARE THE BETTER TO DAY IS AND THE BETTER WE SET OURSELVES UP TO EITHER MAKE TO MORROW EVEN BETTER TO DAY OR IF TO MORROW GIVES ME A CHALLENGE I DON'T HAVE TO DAY I CAN MEET THAT CHALLENGE AND GET BACK TO A BETTER PLACE SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THE CORNER STONES OF SELF CARE FOR SAKE OF MENTAL HEALTH INVOLVES ASKING REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT ONES SELF YES YES I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HEARD IT DEFINED THAT WAY BEFORE YES YOU KNOW A IT'S IN SUCH START CONTRAST TO THE OTHER FORMS OF SELF CARE WHICH I CERTAINLY SUBSCRIBE TO AS WELL LIKE MAKING SURE ONE GETS ENOUGH REST AND A YOU KNOW AVOIDS TOXSIC PEOPLE TO THE SEN ONE CAN ET CETERA OR TOXIC ENVIRONMENTS AND SO ON RIGHT YOU MENTION ASK QUESTIONS OF THE SELF BUT BUT THE THE LOGICAL NEXT QUESTION TO THAT IS WHAT QUESTIONS DO I ASK MYSELF SOMETIMES WE KNOW WHE WE HAVE AN IDEA RIGHT SOMETIMES WE DON'T AND THIS IS WHERE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LIFE NARRATIVE AT LET ME THINK ABOUT MY LIFE LET ME POTENTIALLY TALK ABOUT MY LIFE WITH A TRUSTED OTHER PERSON LET ME POTENTIALLY WRITE DOWN A NARRATIVE ABOUT MY LIFE AND WE CAN LEARN SO MUCH FROM DOING THAT SO THE PERSON WHO THINGS BACK AND STARTS TO TELL THE STORY OF THEMSELVES AND AND LET SAY JUST AS AN EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THAT STORY IS IS GOING PRETTY WELL AND THE PERSON IS FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEN SAY SOMETHING HAPPENS N IT STARTS TO CHANGE OR THEN THIS THING HAPPENED AND THEN OUKNOWEST STARTED CONT I SPENDING TIME WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE OR STARTED DATING DIFFERENT PEOPLE OR I TOOK A DIFFERENT KIND OF JOB AND AND IT CAN ENGENDER THE REFLECTION OF LIKE OH EXTHINGS REALLY CUT CHANGED THEN BECAUSE BECAUSE THE EMOTION SYSTEMS WITHIN US DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CLOCK OR THE CALENDAR THE EMOTIONS OFTEN OF NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES CAN BACK MAP INTO OUR LIVES AND SOME ONE WHO CAN TELL YOU I WAS MISERABLE EVER SINCE I WAS A CHILD CAN THEN WRITE OUT A LIFE NARRATIVE THAT DESCRIBES A VERY HAPPY CHILDHOOD UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENED OR SOMETHING CHANGE AT A CERTAIN POINT WHICH COULD BE SOMETHING DRAMATIC OR IT MIGHT BE INCREASING PRESSURES OF SCHOOL OR INCREASING SOCIAL PRESSURES OR HOW THINGS CHANGED AT PUBERTY IAND IF WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT WE MAY KNOW THE RIGHT QUESTIONS IK FOR EXAMPLE LET SAY AFTERWARDS THE PERSON FINDS AT THEIR DRINKING MOR AN EXAMPLE WOULD COMMON EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF TAKING THAT FOR GRANTED OR THAT'S WHAT I DO IT OR THE I CAN'T COPE ANY BETTER IN THE NEGATIVE THINGS PEOPLE WILL SAY TO THEMSELVES THE NARRATIVE CAN OFTEN POINT OUT I CAN COPE BETTER I DID COPE BETTER I DID FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT MYSELF SO THAT THE LIFE NARRATIVE CAN REALLY HELP US ESTABLISH THE ROAD MAP I AM PART OF WHAT THE LIFE NARRATIVE DOES AS IT GUIDES US TO THE PLACES TO ASK THE QUESTIONS IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND AS IT'S ALSO LITLEBIT MORE ABOUT HOW ONE WOULD DO THIS ON THEIR OWN TOS IS INBOLVE JOURNALING THINGS OUT I CONFESS I HAVE A FILE ON MY COMPUTER A THAT HAS A BUNCH OF OTHER FILES THAT STARTS WITH AE ZERO TO FIVE AND THEN I HAVE SOME NOTES AND THERE IT'S NOT AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY FAR FROM IT IT'S JUST AND OF HIGH LIGHTS OF EVENTS THAT I REMEMBER EN OR SIX TO TEN AND SO ON AND PLACE AS I LIVED AND  I USE IT JUST O AN ORIENT MYSELF IN TIME YES A I ISHA DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE PURPOSE IN UTILITY OF IT IS AR WHY I INITINALLY STARTED DOING THIS BUT IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT VILE TO ME AH AND WHEN I RETURN TO IT I OFTEN REMEMBER ADDITIONAL KEY EVENTS SO IT'S CONSTANTLY GROWING IM IT IT THE S MILES AGAIN QUITE LARGE AH AGAIN WITH NO SPECIFIC A PURPOSE OF WRITING THIS OUT T AT ANY POINT BUT JUST TO ORIENT RIGHT RIGHT YOU YOU YOU CAN'T NOT LEARN ABOUT YOURSELF FROM DOING THAT RIGT IT EXPOSE HIS TRUTHS HIMSELF IT MAKES YOU PONDER ABOUT THINGS IT DRAWS YOUR ATTENTION TO WAYS IN WHICH YOU'VE CHANGED WHETHER YOU THINK THOSE WAYS OR GOOD OR BAD RITY THAT IT DRAWS YOUR ATTENTION TO CHANGE IT DRAWS YOUR ATTENTION TO THE IMPACT OF EXTERNAL EVENTS AND AS YOU SAID ITS IT GROUNDS YOU IT PROVIDES WAY OF LOCALIZING ONESELF AND TIME LIKE I AM HERE NOW WAY HOW DID I GET HERE RIGHT AND IN THE THOUGHTS AND IDEAS OF HOW WE GOT HERE VERY MUCH HELP US BECAUSE OFTEN WE DON'T DO THAT YOU KNOW A SORT OF RUSHING HEADLONG FULWORD BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS ARE OUR SOCIETY IS PROMPTING AS WE LIVE IN A VERY FAST MOVING SOCIETY WE WANT INFORMATION AND GRATIFICATION AND OFTEN WE DON'T EVEN WANT IT VERY FAST BUT IT'S COMING AT US VERY FAST ANYWAY AND TO STOP AND REFLECT MAKES A VERY VERY BIG DIFFERENCE EVEN EVEN TO THINK AT TIMES BEYOND OUR GENERATIONS RIGHT INTO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ON ONE SIDE OF MY FAMILY EVERY ONE WAS A SHEPHERD FOR LIKE EVERY GENERATION UNTIL LIKE TOO AGO RIGHT AND THINKING ABOUT THAT OF LIKE ON AS INTERESTING RIGHT IT MAKES ME IT MAY WAYS GRATEFUL SO GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I HAVE HAD BUT I ALSO THINK WHILE THEY LIVED IN CLOSE NICT COMMUNITIES THEN IN WHAT WAS THAT LIKE AND IN IT WE BEGIN TO SEE OURSELVES IN A BROADER WAY BOTH IN OUR OWN HISTORY AND THEN PROJECTING FORWARD WHICH WHICH SOMETIMES IS ABOUT CHILDREN AND NURTURING CHILDREN BUT IT CAN CERTAINLY BE ABOUT OTHER THINGS IT CAN BE ABOUT FRIENDSHIP IT CAN BE ABOUT WORK SO WE START TO SEE OURSELVES IN WAYS THAT ARE INTERESTING THAT AR THROUGH THE LENS OF TRUTH AND THAT SPEAK TO OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD AROUND US AND I THINK THIS ENGENDERS BOTH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IGHT IF UM AWARE OF LIKE ON WHAT HAVE I DONE WHAT HAVE I ACCOMPLISHED WHEN HAVEN'T I ACCOMPLISH THINGS HOW MIGHT THAT BE DIFFERENT AND AND A SENSE OF GRATITUDE FOR BEING HERE AND HAVING OPPORTUNITY AND YEVEN BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW MY GUESS IS WHEN YOU READ THROUGH THOSE FILES THAT AT' SOME POINTS YOU HAVE SOF A SENSE OF MARVEL WHILE LIKE WO THAT'S ME RIGHT WHETHER IT'S A GOOD MEMORY OR ITS A DIFFICULT MEMORY KNOW IT'S ALL PART OF YOU THAT LEADS YOU THROUGH TO TO DAY AND YOU DO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF SELF THROUGH THAT ONE OF THE FEELINGS I MUST OFTEN COME AWAY FROM THOSE EXCURSIONS INTO THOSE FILES WITH IS ONE OF GRATITUDE BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT'S IN THOSE FILES UN AR RECOLLECTIONS OTHERS THAT I REALLYAPPRECIATE SOME AR STIL LIVE SOME AREN'T AND IM WHAT THAT'S MEANT TO ME AND HOW THAT CARRIES ME FORWARD A I SO THAT'S WHAT I DO UM I 'M SURE THERE ARE A MERE INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS THAT PEOPLE COULD DO THIS BUT WHAT WHATERE FEW THAT YOU'VE SEEN WORK REALLY WELL IM THAT PEOPLE CAN DO ON THEIR OWN OR PERHAPS WITH A CLINATION AS WELL IN FACT THAT RAISES THE QUESTION SHOULD PEOPLE SHARE THIS SORT OF PRACTICE AND THE CONTENTS OF THAT PRACTICE WITH WITH A TRUST OF CLINITION  YE THINK SHARING WITH AN WITH ANOTHER PERSON ALWAYS SHOULD BE AATTRUSTED OTHER RIGHT AND WE CAN KIND TAKE STOCK OF THAT YOU KNOW OF PEOPLE HAVE AN IDEA WHO MAY BE SAFE AND OFTEN PEOPLE OLDERS KNO ONE I COULD SHARE SOMETHING WITH BUT REALLY THAT OFTEN COMES TO LENDS A FEAR IN OF EXPOSURE OF SELF OF REJECTION OF OWN RABILITY WHICH OFTEN IS WARRANTED BUT SOMETIMES IS NOT SOMETIMES THEY REALLY ARE TAN OFTEN THERE ARE SAFE PEOPLE I SO THE THE ACT OF DOING SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING BRINGS AS YOU WELL KNOW IT IT BRINGS PARTS OF OUR BRAIN ON LINE THAT THEN ARE THINKING IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY BR ING ERROR CORRECTION MECHANISMS ON LINE SO IF I'M THINKING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING NO THAT CAN BE JUST AUTOMATIC INSIDE OF ME BUT IF I START TO RIHT OR TO TALK OR EVEN TO FORMULATE WORDS O TALK TO MYSELF OR TO PUT WORDS IN MY MIND AS IF I WERE TALKING NOW WE COME AT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND WE WE CAN TO FERRIT OUT THE TRUTH WITHIN US WHICH MIGHT BE YO IT'S NOT TRUE THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THINGS OR CHIEF THINGS AND AND PEOPLE OFTEN BRING THAT ON LINE BY DOING SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE SAME THOUGHT PROCESS THAT'S GONE OFTEN OVER AND OVER AND IT'S NON PRODUCTIVE AND IT BRINGS DOWN MOOD AND T RAISES ANXIETY AND THAT ALSO BUILD A SENSE OF FUTILITY MEAN I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW OFTEN I'VE HEARD A PERSON SAY NO GOOD'LL COME OF THIS OR LIKE O K TRY WILL TRY BUT I KNOW I CAN'T BE OI BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR TEN YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS BUT WHAT THEY BEEN DOING IS THE SAME THING THEY'VE BEEN RUMINATING ON IT FOR TEN YEARS THEY START TALKING ABOUT IT AND AND PEOPLE WILL SAY O MY GOODNESS I I'VE A CHEEVED MORE IN TWO HOURS YOUTHAN I THAN I DID IN YEARS BUT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE OING SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE TWO HOURS SO THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE CAN'T SAY O CAY GO LOOK IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND SEE WHAT YOU FIND THERE RIGHT SO THEN WE NEED WAYS OF ACCESSING THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND H COMMUNICATION EITHER WITH SELF IN WRITING WITH OTHERS CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL IN DOING THAT I ALSO IAM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT KNOWLEDGE IS POWER MANY TIMES I WILL FEEL LIKE IVE I' HAVE A SENSE OF REALLY HAVING HELPED SOMEONE AND THAT OTHER PERSON MAY HAVE THAT SENSE HAN WE CAN SEE THE CHANGE AND ALL THAT I'VE DONE IS IN PART KNOWLEDGE TEWE ALL KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS SO OFTEN IT'S THE CASE THAT I HAPPEN TO HAVE LEARNED THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THAT OTHER PERSON LEARNS THEN I'M COMMUNICATING TO THEM THINGS THAT I HAVE LEARNED SO THEY KNOW THEM TOO AND THEN THEY FEEL TREMENDOUSLY BETTER T BECAUSE IF WE PUT INSIDE OF OURSELVES THE TOOLS OF UNDERSTANDING ARE UNCONSCIOUS MINDS AND SOMETIMES OUR CONSCIOUS MINDS TOO WILL WORK ON THEM WILL MAKE USE OF THEM SO SO IF YOU TALK TO A PERSON FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT HOW TROMIC CAN IMPACT US AND HOW WE CAN SHOVE IT UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE AND HOW CAN SPIN OFF SHAME THAN THAT PERSON MAY TAKE THAT KNOWLEDGE AWAY AND COME BACK WITH REAL UNDERSTANDING AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN DO THIS ON OUR OWN REN WE CAN DO THIS THROUGH GOOD RESOURCES WE CAN DO THIS BY TAKING INFORMATION INTO OURSELVES THAT CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE BECAUSE THE FIRST PLACE TO START AR WITH THINGS WE CAN DO THAT DON'T REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL HELP RIGHT AND AND SOMETIMES WE MAY COMMAT PROBLEMS THAT THAT DO TELL US THAT WE SHOULD GET PROFESSIONAL HELP RIGHT SO IF WE'RE HAVING THOUGHTS OF SELF HARM THOUGHTS OF NOT WANTING TO BE ALIVE THOUGHTS OF REAL DESPAIR THOUGHTS OF REAL OF HOPELESSNESS THAT'S TELLING US O C LET'S GET SOME HELP THERE'S A ROLE IN A PLACE FOR PROFESSIONAL HELP BUT PEOPLE COME TO PROFESSIONAL HELP IN OTHER WAYS TOO SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE REFLECTING ON THE SELF AN AND TO REAL EXAMPLE PERSON THINKING YOU KNOW I REALLY BECAN'T CUN A DIFFERENT WHEN TON WHEN THINGS START O CHANGING LIKE AFTER COLLEGE AND THEN I THOUGHT LIKE OH I'VE COT A GOT INTO THIS PLACE AND I'VE GOT A GOOD JOB AND LIKE THINGS REALLY SHOULD GET BETTER WELL IT THEY CAN'T HAVE IN RIGHT AND THAT WAS REALLY A BRANCHPOINT THAT PERSON MAY HAVE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT OR THEY MAY HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT TEN THOUSAND TIMES THEN SHOVED IT UNDERNEACH FROM IF FROM CONSCIOUSNESS TO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE IT'S A SCARY VONRABILITY IN DUCING THINGIS SEEMS SCAREY LIKE HOW COULD IT BE THAT I CHIEVE THINGS AND DIN N'T GET HEALTHIER NOW WE'RE AFRAID OF THAT RIGHT AND AND LETTING THAT COME TO THE SURFACE BEING ALL BUT TO SAY OH LIKE THAT'S TRUE LIKE I DON'T ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID TO SHINE LIGHT ON THAT THEND A LOT OF TIMES THAT ALONE SOMETIMES A PERSON WILL SOVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS THEY THINK ABOUT IT THEY COME IN THEY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS DAY THANK ME I DID NOTHING BUT LISTEN BUT THE LISTENING PART IS IMPORTENT IT ALLOWED THEM TO COME IN AND SAY WHAT THEY NEEDED TO SAY AND OTHER TIMES THAN IT'S NOT IT CAN BE THAT BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT OTHER TIMES IT INFORMS US ABOUT WHAT TO WORK ON CLINICALLY AND IT MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING THAT'S DIRE RIGHT IT MIGHT JUST BE LIK I WON'T UNDERSTAND THIS I WONT TO BE HAPPY I WANT TO BE HEALTHYER WANT TO WORK TOWARDS THESE GOOD THINGS WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS IF YOU REALLY DOSTOL DOWN WHAT THEY TALKING ABOUT SINCE APPEASE THE SENSE OF CONTENTMENT COMING AT THE WORLD THROUGH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND AND WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH SELF INQUIRY INCLUDING THROUGH PHARIPY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO JUST BE FOR SITUATIONS WHERL IS A SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL PROBLEM IS IT THE CASE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY JOURNALS A BIT OF THEIR LIFE NARRATIVE OR THINKS ABOUT GREAT OR SADLY DRAMATIC EVEINST THAT PERHAPS HAPPEN TO THEM AT WHATEVER STAGE OF LIFE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ACCOMPLISHED IN THAT ACTION OR IN THAT THERAPYSESSION IF THEYRE DOING IT WITH A CLINITION BUT THAT WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT AND PERHAPS IN THEIR WAKING STATES AS WELL THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS IS WORKING SOME OF THAT THROUGH SUCH THAT YOU REVELATIONS COME TO MIND LATER A INSIGHTS COME TO MIND A YOU KNOW I'M CERTAINLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT THERE CERTAIN TIMES OF DAY AN EVENING WHERE MY BRAIN IS IN A BIT OF ELIMINAL STATES FEELS LIKE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SLEEP AND AWAKE AND I JUST HAVE LEARNED THAT PROVIDED I BLOCK AGAINST A OUTSIDE SENSORY AND PUT AS MUCH AS I CAN I IN PARTICULAR SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS THAT I'LL JUST BE ON DOING THE DISHES OR PREPARING COFF IERSELY AND SOMETHING WILL COME TO MIND THAT SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE IT'S NOT ALWAYS A GREAT INSIDE IF FAC GETS RARELY A GREAT INSIGHT BUT IT ALWAYS TAKES ME A BIT BY SURPRISE SOMETIMES ALL A BIT OF DELIGHT SOMETIMES ALA BIT OF SHOCLY GUALICK WHERE DO THAT COME FROM CAUSE IT CAME FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT IT WAS INVISIBLE TO YOU THAT IT GOT THROWN UP AND YOUR WO AN YOU REALIZE IT WHILE IN THE MIDST OF DOING SOMETHING RELATIVELY MONDANE RIPIS DURING THE DAY YOU'RE ENGAGING YOUR BRAIN IS HIGHLY ENGAGED WHICH IS GREAT BUT IT DOESN'T LEAVE A LOT OF ROOM RIGHT OO FOR THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO DO IT'S MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF THINGS A SECOND THAT CAN HELP YOU FIGURE THINGS OUT WHICH IS THE SAME REASON IT'S UNCANNY ANY ANY SECHIATRIS WILL TELL YOU THIS THAT THAT PEOPLE A PERSON WILL COME IN AND SAY IT'S STRANGE YOU KNOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN WHEN I CAN FINALY RELAX LIKE THAT'S WHEN I HAVE A PANIC ATTACK RIGHT OR THEY DON'T KNOW LIKE THEN I CAN FINALY RELAX I GO AH THEN MY HEART'S BEATING FAST AND I'M SWEATING RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE PANIC ATTACKS COMEIS THE PERSON IS LABORING UNDER SOMETHING THAT IS THERE'S CAUSING THEM THE SOCONSTANT DISTRESS WHEN WHEN YOU STOP FOCUSSING OUTWARDING YOU SO TO SETTLE INTO AN INWARD STATE THEN THE THINGS THAT ARE UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE OR GANG TO COME TO THE SURFACE AND FOR SOMETHING REALLY BOTHERING YOU THAT YOUR BRAIN IS VERY UPSET ABOUT A VERY AFRAID OF WHAT IS IT THROW UP TO THE SURFACE A PANIC ATTACK RIGHT BUT IF YOU'RE IN A GOOD PLACE YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF YORE IN A GENERATIVE STAGE ORE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT THEN WHEN YOU YOU STOP PUTTING ALL THE ATTENTION OUTWARD SO WE IMAGINE THAN SAILIENCS CHANGES AND INSTEAD OF A LOT OF THE SAILINGS BEING OUTWARD IT STARTS TO BE INWARD AND YOURE JUST SO TO MEDITATIVE YOU'RE WASHING THE DISHES RIGHT AND THEREIS ROOM THEN FOR YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO THROW SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO THE SURFACE IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW PEOPLE CAN'T REMEMBER SOMETHING IF THEY'RE TRYING TO THINK OF IT AND MEAN WE ALL GO THROUGH THIS I CAN'T REMEMBER THAT PERSON'S NAME OR THAT RESTAURANT OR WHETEVE IT IS TRY TO KEEP THINKING ABOUT IT AND SEE IF YOU FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT THE ANSWERS NOT IN YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND SO IF YOU KEEP BRING YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TO BEAR YOU JUST GENERATE FRUSTRATION RIGHT BUT THEN WHEN YOU STOP THINKING ABOUT THE ANSWERS THERE INSIDE OF YOU OH I REMEMBER NOW RIGHT SO SO THAT'S HOW IF WE IF WE HAVE THE CONSCIOUS MIND ENGAGE IN SOMETHING IS NOCKING TO FIGURE OUT THEN IT DOESN'T FIGURE THE THING OUT AND AND THAT WORKS FOR OUR PROBLEMS TOO THAT'S WHY A PERSON CAN SAY I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FOR TEN YEARS O YOU RUMINATED ABOUT IT FOR TEN YEARS IT JUST RAN OVER AND OVER AND OVER IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND AND HOW IRONIC RAT IT PREVENTS UNDERSTANDING SO IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT ASKING CERTAIN KINDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ONESELF AND ONCE SELF NARRATIVE I LIFE HISTORY ESSECIALLY CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL IN THE MOMENT OR MOMENTS OF DOING THAT PRACTICE AS WELL AS THE SEBCONSCIOUS OR I GUESS THE THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO REFER TO IT IS THE UNCONSCIOUS FOR THOSE OUT THERE WHO LIKE ME SOMETIMES SAY SUBCONSCIOUS ITS UNCONSCIOUS A THE UNCONSCIOUS CAN THROW THINGS UP TO THE SURFACE THAT CAN BE REAL INSIGHTS CAN CAN GIVE US NOT JUST PANIC ATTACKS WHICH I THING MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SHY AWAY FROM BUT AS YOU POINT OUT THERE'S INFORMATION IN THE FACT THAT THE PANIC ATTACK IS OCCURRING UNDER IGT CONDITION AND IT MUST STIR UP THE POT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS AND YOU PUT SOME NEW INFORMATION IN I IT CAN DO NEW THINGS I CAN FIGURE NEW THINGS OUT WHICH IS WHY THE PROCESS OF SELF REFLECTION FOR EXAMPLE AND OFTEN THE PROCESS OF THERAPY IS NOT ALWAYS IN IN FACT OFTEN IS NOT A PLEASANT PROCESS BUT THEN WE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT HARD WORK RENEWED INSIGHTS SO SOME ONE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WHO WHO KNOWS THEY KNOW THAT A CERTAIN PROME IS INSIDE OF THEM AND HAS BEEN EFFECTING THEM WHETHER IT FOR DAYS OR WEEKS OR YEARS THEY KNOW IT THEY DON'T KNOWAT TO DO ABOUT IT THEY HAVE A CONFLICT ABOUT IT SO TO KEEP TRYING TO SHOVE IT UNDER THE SURFACE THEY THEY FINALLY AXCEPT FOR WHATEVER REASON TO TALK ABOUT IT AND A WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS THEN IS LET THEY DOING THREE OR FOUR SUCCESSIVE WEEKS OF HOURLY THERAPEMEG THAT PERSON IS CRYING AND THAT PERSON IS UPSET OR THE PERSON IS ANGRY AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN THIS WAY BUT IT DOESNAT FAIR MAN AT THE TIME AS TH EY GET BETTER AND BETTER RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE DISCHARGING SOME OF THE ENERGY RGHT MAY BE THEYR CRYING AND THAT THEY'RE SAD BECAUSE THEY'RE GRIEVING SOMETHING THEY HAVEN'T GRIEVED BEFORE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST BEEN ANGRY RIGHT WERE THEY'VE JUST BEEN ASHAMED A CLASSIC EXAMPLE IS A DEATH MAYHOW MANY TIMES DO PEOPLE THINK WER THAT CAN'T BE STILL AFFECTING ME IT WAS EXT NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BUT THEY'VE NEVER ACTUALLY GRIEVED BECAUSE THEY CARRY IN THEM OH IT WAS MY FAULT RIGHT AND AND HOW MANY TIMES WE HEAR THAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE GONE OUNO WE THEN BACK MAP SOMETHING THAT MAKES US FEEL BAD AND THEN FROM THE GUILT AND SHAMED COME THE INABILITY TO PROCESS GRIEF SO IF THE PERSON THEN DEALS WITH RIGHT I FEEL SO BAD ABOUT THIS IN FACT I FEEL SO ASHAMED OF IT AND I FEEL IT GITST MY FAULT AND S KAY  LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT AFTER MY AFTER MY BROTHER'S DEATH RIGT SUICIDE I FELT RESPONSIBLE ANI WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY WAY AN MENTAL HEALTH I HAD A BUSINESS CAREER AT THE TIME AND I FINALLY WENT AND SAW SOME ONE I WASN'T ACCULTURATED THAT GETTING THERAPY WAS SOMETHING ONE DID BUT I REALIZED AH I'M NOT OQU RIGHT SO I DIDN'T KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW HOW RIGHT I JUST KNEW THE MANIFESTATION OF IT WHICH WAS MISERY AND RISK AND YNO IGHT I COULD JUST TELL LIKE I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO NOT FEEL LIKE THIS AND THIS IS NOT OQUT SO SO THAT I N MI CALL THE INSURENCE NUMBER  ENSHALL I GOIND AND AN SEE ATHARAPIST AND YOU KNOW SHE DID I'M SURE SHE WAS A VERY GOOD THARAPISTS BUT SHE DIDN'T INNOCENT ME TO BE IN THE SENSE AT SOMETIMES WE DON'T NEED TO USE ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW WE CAN DO TO SOMETHING BASIC WITH SOMEONE AND THAT'S ALL SHE DID WITH ME AM SHE GOT ME TALKING ABOUT IT THEN I TALKED ABOUT HOW SHAMED I WAS BECAUSE IT WAS MY FAULT AND THEN REALLY AND THEN SHE CHALLENGED ME ABOUT THAT AND THEN YOU KNOW IN A NICE WAY BUT THEN IT WAS BECAME CLEAR THAT I WAS SO UTTERLY SHOCKED BY IT RIGHT FAR FROM IT BEING FORSEEABLE TO ME RIGHT THAT THAT THE PPROBLEM THAT I WAS HAVING NOW ALL WAS THE SHOCK OF IT AND THE SENSE OF SHAME AND GILT THAT IT RAISED IN ME AND THEN ME SHOVING IT UNDER THE SURFACE NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH IT THEN IT'S MAKING ALL SORTS OF MISERY IN ME AND I CAN'T ACTUALLY GRIEV RIGHT SO IT'S SOME POINT DOING THOSE SESSIONS NOW'M SAD AND I'M CRYING RIGHT AND AND I KNOW WHAT SHE WAS THINKING RIGHTS YOU GOOD OQUET THIS IS IKE THIS THANK GOODNESS IS MISSPERS O GETTING BETTER SH I FELL A SENSE OF RELIEF BECAUSE SHE COULD SEE AMIES HE'S COMING OUT OF RISK HE'S ABLE TO FEEL SADNESS HE'S ABLE TO GRIEVE HE USN'T BEEN DOING THIS BEFORE YOU KNOW SO IT'S IT'S THAT IIT'S THAT WORK WIGHT IF WE PUT INTO IT THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE JUST AS WIN PHYSICAL HEALTH AN MEAN IF I WANT TO BE STRONGER O I WANT TO BE MORE ROBUS LIKE I'VE TO GO TO THE GIMAN WORK OR I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S HARD WORK AND THEN I GET THE BENEFIT OF IT AND THE SAME IS TRUE WHETHER WE REFLECTING ON OUR LIFE NARRATIVE AND IT BRINGS YOU KNOW SOME DIFFICULT EMOTIONS TO US OR RATHER WE TALKING WITH SOMEONE OR WHETHER WE DOING IT IN THERIPY BUT THAT'S HOW THAT THAT PROCESS OF INQUIRY LEADS US YOU KNOW TO TAKE SOME OF THE GORDIAN KNOTS IN US SO TO SPEAK IN AND TO CAUT THEM INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LI COME ING IN A FEELO CAT ABOUT MYSELF EVEN THOUGH I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR MY BROTHER'S DEATH BECAUSE I I SHOULD FORESEEN AT ME THAT THE THAT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT YOU HAVE TO SINK I SEE WHAT THAT THING IS AND THAT THAT HAS TO GO AWAY AND THEN THERE BE CAN LEAD US TO THE POINROUL WASN'T MY FAULT THEN ON MY GOODNESS I'M SAD I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS AG ONE AG ONE IS A VITAMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT MEETS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS I STARTED TAKING AG ONE WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SO'M DELIGHTED THAT THE R SPONSORING THE POD CAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING AG ONE AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE G ONE ONCE OR GENERALLY TWICE PER DAY IS THAT IT'S THE EASIEST WAY FOR ME TO INSURE THAT I'M GETTING ALL OF THE VITAMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBER THAT I NEED IN MY DIET NOW OF COURSE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO GET PROPER NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS BUT MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FIND IT HARD TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS O FRUITS AND VEGETABLES EACH DAY AND ESPECIALLY TO GET ENOUGH PRE BIOTICS AND PROBIODICTS TO INSURE GOT HEALTH AS YOU MAY KNOW YOUR GOT CONTAINS TRILLIANS OF LITTLE MICROBIODA THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBYOM WHICH ESTABLISHES CRITICAL CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANS OF YOUR BODY TO ENHANCE BRAIN HEALTH AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER ASPECTS THAT RELATE TO MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET IS IF YOU WERE TO TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHICH SUPPLEMENT WOULD THAT BE AND MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS A G ONE BECAUSE BY TAKING A G ONE I'M ABLE TO INSURE THAT I'M GETTING ALL OF THE VITEMENS MINERALS AND PROBIODICTS THAT I NEED TO ENHANCE MY MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE THEY'L TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEM IND THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER I CAN SEE HOW SELF INQIRY IS REALLY POWERFUL A CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE THAT IN MY OWN LIFE AND UM IT'S AN ON GOING PROCESS WRITE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ONE DOES AND THEN STOPS I DEAL YOU DO I FOR EVER JUST LIKE PHYSICAL FITNESS EM AND AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE U PERHAPS OR WEARY OF SELF INQUIRY ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE PAIN POINTS IT CAN BRING ABOUT AND MAKE CONSCIEUS AND THAT WE HAVE TO TELY SIT WITH UM AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO AVOID DISCOMFORT UMI'M SURE THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING QUITE WELL IN LIFE AND THEREFORE THINK OH YOU KNOW PATTERN ERSELF INQUIRY ALL IT COULD DO SOUNDS LIKE IS MORE HARM LIKE WHI WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT BUT I THINK WE BOTH AGRY THAT THERE'S NOTHING BUT GOOD AND PROGRESS AND MORE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE TO BE HAD BY GOING THROUGH PATTERNS OF SELF INQUIRY I THINK THAT REALLY HIGH LIGHT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THAT SELF INQUIRY ISN'T ALWAYS THE RIGHT ANSWER NOW I THINK JUST BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING WELL THAT DOESNIT MEAN SELF INQUIRY ISN'T THE RIGHT THINK TO DO SELF INQUIRI IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IF WE WONT TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES BETTER IN LESS WERE IN A PLACE WHERE IT CAN BRING REAL RISK US SO WHEN I WAS TRYING TO THINK ABOUT MYSELF INQUIRE WHY WAS A SO MISERABLE WHAT'S GOING ON IN ME I REACHED A POINT WHERE I REALSIC I'M NOT M NOT GETTING MYSELF ANYWHERE AND I'M GETTING WORSE AND LIKE THIS IS NOW THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR ME CAUSE IT'LL WEAR THE SELF INQUIRY LEAD ME TO MORE GUILT AND SHAME SO THN AT SOME POINT A SORT OF PULL THE RIPCORD RIGHT ONS THAT I CAN'T DO THES O MY OWN ANY MORE RIGHT AND AND THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ANYONE WHOS LISTENING IF YOU FEEL LIKE LOOK I DON'T THINK I'M IN A SAY FOR A STABLE PLACE AND THOUGHTS OF SELF HARM THOUGHTS OF HOPELESSNESS THEN THEN IT PROBABLY IS NOT OR LET'S ARRON TESIDE BE INCAUTIOUS BUT IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA THAN TO ENGAGE IN SELF INQUIRY RIT FIRST GO SEE SOME ONE CLINICALLY RIGHT AND AN NOW THAT CAN BE HARD TO DO AND IN THIS DAY IN AGE BUT IF WE REALLY ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES WE REALLY PUSH YOU KNOW WE REALLY IN WE WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO TRY AND GET IN FRONT O SOME ONE WHO CAN KIND HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MAY NEED A MAYBE THAT PERSON HELPS US WITH THE PROCESS OF SELF INQUIRY MAYBE THAT PERSON REASSURES US MAYBE THAT PERSON THAN TELLS US THAT WE WE REALLY DO NEED YOU DON'T MORE CARE MORE HELP AND THEN IT LEADS TO US GETTING THAT SO THAT WE CAN COME BACK TO THE GOOD PLACE OF BEING WELL ENOUGH FOR THE SELF INQUIRY I'M GRATEFUL YOU SHARED YOUR PATH TO WORKING WITH A CLINITION AND THE FACT THAT JUST FOCUSSING ON SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN WASN'T REALLY WORKING AND THERE WAS A SOUNDS LIKE A REQUIREMENT FOR CLINITION TO HELP GUIDE YOU THROUGH THAT AM IT RELATES DIRECTLY TO A WHAT A MOST CURIOUS ABOUT AT THIS MOMENT WHICH IS YOU KNOW IN THE MAP THAT YOU ESTABLISHED FOR US IN EPISODE ANEO THAT IS CARRIED THROUGH ALL THESE EPISODES AND AND BY THE WAY OF PEOPLE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE MAP WE ILL COVER IT A IN TOP CONTOUR AND AL BIT MORE DEPTH NOT IN A MOMENT HERE BUT ONE OF THE KEY THINGS AS WER CUPBOARDS AS WERE REFERRING TO THEM OT TO LOOK IN IN ORDER TO EXERT SELF GARE AND IMPROVE ONCE MENTAL HEALTH IS THIS A NOTION OF SELF AWARENESS OF A REALLY UNDERSTAND ING THAT THERE'S AN AN I A ME AND EXPLORING WHAT THAT'S REALLY ABOUT IN THE MOMENT BUT ALSO HISTORICALLY THROUGH NARRATIVE ET CETERA  ALSO IN THIS A MAP IS A COPBOARD THAT A RELATES TO SALIENTS WHAT'S MOST OBVIOUS OR WHAT TO WE DEFAULT TO BOTH INTERNALLY IN TERMS OF WHAT SORTS OF THOUGHTS WE DEFAULT TO AND EXTERNALLY WHAT WE FOCASSING ON IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND I THINK I AND PERHAPS MANY OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE WONDERING HOW TO RESOLVE ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN A PRACTICE THAT IS AIMED AT INCREASING SELF AWARENESS AND PERHAPS EVBEN DRAWING TO MINE EARLY TRAMAS OR CHALLENGES OR RECENT TRAMAS OR CHALLENGES AND SALIENTS IN OTHER WORDS IF I WERE TO TAKE SOME MOMENTS OR EVEN AN HOUR ONCE A WE CAN SIT THERE REALLY LIK THINK ABOUT THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT ITHAT THAT HAVE BEEN A GNAWING AT ME BELOW THE SURFACE FOR A VERY LONG TIME THAT THE STUFF THAT I YOUN GAIN SOME PROFICIENCY AT PUSHING DOWN BENEATH THE SURFACE I THINK ONE FEAR THAT I HAVE AND SOL HAVE TO SUME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE IT AS WELL IS THAT IF I WERE TO BRING THAT TO MIND THAT IT WOULD OVERTAKE A LOT OF MY WAKING HOURS I GET'S I GOT O WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS THING ORE THOSE THINGS AND SO NOW WHAT SALIENT IS SOMETHING NEGATIVE AND WHEN I'M FOCASED ON SOMETHING NEGATIVE THAN I'M NOT ABLE TO BE AS GENERATIVE AS I WOULD LIKE OUN I MOVE MY LIFE MOVED FORWARD TOWARD MY LIFE GOALS NOW I I COULD EVEN HAVE THE REALIZATION THAT THE COGNIT OFE UNDERSTANDING THAT OKEY THAT'S BUT THAT'S NECESSARY RIGHT LIKE THIS IS LIKE GETTING A A WOUNDFEXED OR OR DEALING WITH IT WITH A CHRONIC INJURY LIKE SOON OR LATER YOU GOT A DEAL WITH IT OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE AT YOUR BEST BUT THAT AM CONFLICT BETWEEN GAINING MORE SELF AWARENESS AND ALSO THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT IS MOST SALIENT TO US IS KIND OF DEFINES THE QUALITY OF OUR DAILY LIFE AM THAT THAT CONFLICT OR FRICTION A SEEMS LIKE AN IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO DRILL INTO A LITTLE BET ABSOLUTELY A I WOULD IT IS IF YOU THINK TH ERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T BRING UP INTO CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE OVER YOUR MIND OR AS PEOPLE OFTEN SALING IN A CURL UP IN A FEDAL POSITION ONIN A CRY AND NEVER STOP THAT IS EXACTLY THE THING YOU MUST LOOK AT BECAUSE SALIENCS PRESENTS ITSELF IN A WHOLE ARRAY OF WAYS SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU THAT'S THAT'S STRONG ENOUGH RIT THAT IT'S THROWING ITSELF UP TO THE SURFACE LIKE A MAYBEYOU WONE TO THINK ABOUT ME RAS YOURE UNCONSCIOUS MIND THROWING IT UP TO THE SURFACE THAT IS ACTIVE IN YOU AND OFTEN IT ALTHOUGH A LOT OF IT HAPPENS IN THE UN CONSCIOUS MIND IT HAPPENS ALSO IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND AND IF THE PERSON THEN STOPS AND THINKS HOW MUCH MIGHT THAT THING THAT YOU ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT BE IMPACTING YOU HOW MIGHT IT BE SALIENT IN OTHER WAYS AND SOMETIMES A PERSON WILL REALIZ A YET THAT'S ALL MY MIND YOVES IT WN IT'S ON MY MIND YOW ALL THE TIME IS A KIND OF ON THE BACK BURNER BUT ALWAYS THERE IN NISES RIGHT WE BE OL N THE BACK BURNER THA YOU KNOW THAT'S LIKE HAVING A VOICE IN THE BACKGROUND TELLING YOU SOMETHING YOU KNO VERY NEGATIVE OF VERY DISTRESSING AND IT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE WHERE WERE OFTEN TIMES THERE'S A REALIZATION THAT THAT THING IS ACTUALLY QUITE SALIENT SOMETIMES THERE ISN'T A REALIZATION INTIL LATER OH THE SALIENCE OF THAT IS THAT I THAT'S HOW OR THAT'S WHY DON'T LET MYSELF GET AHEAD RIGHT IT CAN COME OUT LATER BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT IS UNCONSCIOUS HOW MUCH OF IT IS CONSCIOUS BUT BUT UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES IF THINGS ARE SAFE AND AS WE SAID ITHERE'S NOT SOMETHING GOING ON THAT PRESENT'S RISK AND WANTS CLINICAL CARE IF THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU AND YOU THINK I CAN'T LET THAT TO THE SURFACE THEN WHAT THAT IS TELLING YOU IS I MUST LET THAT TO THE SURFACE NOW GAN WE WANT TO DO IT IN JUDICIOUS WAYS IN DO INTH WAYS THAT ARE SAFE BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE MESSAGE I THINK IT'S A SPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU MENTION THAT IF SOME THING IS GNAWING AT OUR CONSCIOUS MIND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEN IT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE OPERATING BELOW THE LEVEL OF OUR CONSCIENCE WHERE N IS YE RUNNING A MUCK ALL THE LIVE OF CONSCIOUSNESSNISS SO IF EVER THERE WAS A AM A CAUSE FOR EXPLORING SOMETHING LIKE THAT UMTHAT'S IT RIGHT BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE AWARE OF THE WAYS THAT'S DAMAGING TO US OR LIVINTING US AGAIN IT'N SOMEBODY  LISTEN TO THIS COAN BE DOING QUITE WELL THING I'M DOING RIGHTLY WY WHAT I WANT TO DO ANY OF THIS WELL A PERHAPS THEY COULD BE DOING THAT MUCH BETTER ABSOLUTELY SELF AWARNESS AND ADDRESSING ONE'S PERSONAL NARRATIVE AND A SENSE OF EYE IS A WHAT WE CALLED CUPBOARD ONE A UNDER A THE FUNCTION OF SELF NOW FOR THOSE THAT LISTEN TO EPISODES ONE TWO OR THREE AND THEY'LL BE FAMILIAR THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAY A CUPBOARD COPBERED ONE FUNCTION OF SELF BUT A JUST FORSAKE OF GETTING EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD HERE MAYBE WE COULD JUST RETURN TO THE MAP OF MENTAL HEALF A FOR A MOMENT AND WE TALKED ABOU AGENCY INGRATITUDE AS VERB STATES AND YOU ALSO DESCRIBED IN PREVIOUS EPISODES THIS KEY REALLY ESENSIAL CONCEPT OF THIS GENERATIVE DRIVE IS SO IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES FOR US AND REALLY EXPLAIN WHAT AGENCY IN GRATITUDE ARE HOW ONE GOES ABOUT BUILDING THOSE UP AND EXPRESSING THOSE AND WHAT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS AND THEN WE'LL RETURN TO THE TEN CUPBOARDS OF INQUIRY UNDER THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF WHICH REALLY REPRESENT THE PILLARS AND AND ALL THE STUFF THE GEYSERS UP INTO A THES SIMPLE BUT EXTREMELY POWERFUL CONCEPTS AND WAYS OF BEING WHICH OUR AGENCY INGRATITUDE YES YES I I REALLY LIKE WHEN YOU BROUGHT THE IMAGE OF A GEYSER I E TO MIND AS IF WE THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF SELF WHICH IS ONE PILLAR AND THE FUNCTION OF SELF WHICH IS ANOTHER PILLAR UNDERNEATH THOSE PILLARS THERE THE TEN CUPBOARDS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND THEY RE PRESENT THE AREAS OF INQUIRY FOR US BECAUSE THERE THE ASPECTS OF THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF SELF SO THAT'S WERE THE ANSWERS ARE RIGHT THE ANSWERS AR IN THOSE PILLARS THE ANSWERS ARE IN THOSE TEN CUPBERDS SO IF WE'RE DOING THAT WERE LOOKING THERE WERE HONORING WHAT WE FIND THERE WERE BECOMING HEALTHIER THEN THAT GUYSER RIGHT I IMAGINE IT COMING OUT YOU KNOW LIKE HE THE SPACE AND BETWEEN THE PILLARS RIGHT AND AND WHAT IT IS LIFTING UP IS FIRST EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY BUT EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY ARE QUALITIES IS ONLY THE THE WAY AND THE WAY WERE USING THEM TTHEIR QUALITIES ARE POTENTIAL SO I HAVE EMPOWERMENT AS OPPOSED TO BEING DISEMPOWERED RIGHT SO I HAVE HUMILITY INSTEAD OF FOR EXAMPLE A REACTIVE GRANDIOCITY OR EVEN A REACTIVE SELF OPPRESSION RIGHT SO I HAVE THESE QUALITIES OF EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY AND THEN THEY BECOME INACTED RIGHT THEY BECOME EXPRESSED BY US AND I IMAGINE RIDING ON THE TOP IS THE AGENCY AND THE GRATITUDE IS AT THE TOP OF THE GUYSER AND ITS MOVING IGHT THE VERBS WE NAVIGATE LIFE AS LIFE MOVES FORWARD RIGHT I WILL OFTEN THINK LIKE BEING ON LIKE THE THE LUGE RIGHT IN THESE SEE AND THE OLYMPIC WIPER IS GOING DOWN THE TWISTING PATH AND IT'S LIKE THAT'S US MOVING THROUGH LIFE RIGHT AND WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS BUT THEY CAN INTERCONNECT AND THEY CAN CROSS BUT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING LIVING IS AN ACTIVE THING IGHT SO AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ARE ACTIVE THINKS WHY BECAUSE THERE THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF ALL UNDERNEATH F IT OF THEM THAT'S WHERE IT GOES IF THE PILLARS ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE GUYSOR CONFUNCTION THE EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY ARE WITH US O WERE ENGAGING WITH OURSELVES WITH OTHERS WITH THE WORLD THROUGH LENDS OF CLARITY AND THROUGH LENDS OF KNOWING WE CAN MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE AND KNOWI NG OUR ROLE IN IT THAT'S VERY VERY ACTIVE AND THEN IT BRINGS TO US THE PEACE THE CONTENTMENT THE DELIGHT THAT WEAVES IN AND OUT AS AS YOU DESCRIBE THAT YOU WILL FEEL THE PEACE THE CONTENTMENT THE DELIGHT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE SOLOPOTCASTS RIGHT BUT YO YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING VERY VERY ACTIVE RIGHT THAT THAT'S NOT A IS NOT A PASSIVE ENDEAVOUR RIGHT DURING WHICH YOU FEEL ALL THOSE YU BUT THAT MAKE SENSE RIGHT PECE DOESN'T MEAN NOTHINGNESS RIGHT NOW IT CAN SOMEONE WHOSE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW WITH THE GARDEN THEY PLANTET CAN FEEL THAT TOO BUT BUT THERE'S LIFE GOING ON IN THEM ALSO RIGHT THET THE'RE CONTEMPLATING THE GARDEN THEY KNOW THAT THEY MADE THE GARDEN SO THESE ARE ALL ACTIVE PROCESS IS BECAUSE LIFE IS AN ACTIVE PROCESS AND THEN WE END UP IN THIS PLACE OF LOOKING INSIDE OF US THESE DRIVES WITHIN US ARE BOTH DETERMINISTIC AND DETERMINED RIGHT THINK ABOUT HOW ACTIVE OF PROCESS THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE A NATURAL BIUS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE OF OUR GENETICS JUST LIKE SOME ONE HAS A NATURAL APTITUDE TO BE TALLER AND SOME ONE SHORTER OR TO BE MORE OR LESS ATHLETIC BUT WE HAVE POTENTIAL WITHIN US WHEN THE GENETICS COME TOGETHER RIGHT AND AND THAT MAY DETERMINE SOME SUTASET OF PARAMETERS SO SO MAYBE SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE THE BLESSINGS OF BEING SO ATHLETIC PERHAPS MYSELF RIHT  I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE WORLD'S GREATEST ATHLETE RIGT BUT IF I WORK HARD LIKE I BE A LOT MORE ATHLETIC AND HAVE BEEN AT TIMES RIGT AND IF I DON'T I CAN BE A LOT LESS ATHLETIC RIGHT SO SO THERE ARE POTENTIALS WITHIN US THAT GET SO GENETICALLY DETERMINED BUT HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF I A VARIANCE AROUND THEM AND THN AR CHOICES DETERMINE WHERE WE ARE IN THAT VARIANCE IF I DON'T TAKE CARE O MYSELF I WILL BE ON THE VERY LOW END OF THE ATHLETIC SPECTROM RIGHT IF I DO AND I CULTIVATE MYSELF YOU KNOW I AN BE ON A HIGHER AND FOR ME RIGHT BUT STILL THAT'S ALL LOT BETTER THAN THE LOWER END THERE'S A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE THE SAME IS TRUE IN OUR DRIVES SO SO THE MORE WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES WERE REENFORCING THE PRIMACY OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THEN THE AGGRESSION ASSERSION PROACTIVE THAT DRIVE IN US IS REALIVED AS BEST WE'RE GOIN TO REALIZE AND NOT EVERY ONES IS GOINGTO BE OFF THE CHART RIGHT IN AT'S OKE RIGHT BUT BUT THAT DRIVE IS IN A PLACE THAT LETS THAT PERSON TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES YOU KNOW HOW A A JOB THEY ENJOYER AND CAN DO WELL AT AND MAKE OUR HOME LIFE BETTER WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE CAN DO IT WE'RE MORE CERTIVE WE'RE MORE ENGAGED AND THEN THAT'S BRINGING US MORE PLEASURE SO THE PLEASURE DRIVE ITGETS NOT A HEATONISTIC DRIVE ITS DRIVE FOR THINGS WE ENJOY LIKE WE ENJOY SAFETY WE ENJOY ABSENCE OF PAIN BUT WE ALSO ENJOY FRIENDS AD ROMANCE AND SECS AND FOOD LIKE THESE OR THINGS THAT BRING US GRATIFICATION AND WE CAN HAVE THAT IN A HEALTHY PLACE TO SO THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO LITTLE OF THE AGGRESSION ASSERTION PROACTIVE DRIVE NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO LITTLE OF THE PLEASURE DRIVE ND THEN WERE IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN MEET WHERE THOSE DRIVES ARE AT SO IF THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS IN A CERTAIN PLACE IN US WE CAN MEET THAT RIGHT AND MAYBE WE FOSTER IT MOVING A LITTLE HIGHER UP BECAUSE WE'RE DOING GOOD THINGS AND WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES SO IF OUR ROMANCE IS IN A BETTER PLACE YOU KNOW THEN WE CAN TAKE MORE PLEASURE IN OUR ROMANCE RIGHT IF OUR PHYSICAL FITNESSES IN A BETTER PLACE WE CAN ENJOY THAT MORE RAGT WE CAN DO MORE THINGS SO WE ARE HELPING THOSE DRIVES TO BE IN THE OPTIMAL PLACE TO SUBSERVE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO OPTIMIVES AND MAXIMIVE AND THAT PUTS US IN THE BEST PLACE TO HAVE THE THINGS UNDER THOSE PILLARS IN THOSE CUPBOARDS IN A GOOD PL ACE AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT GUYSER IS THE EMPOWERMENT IN THE HUMILITY AND THAN THAT GETS ENACTED AS AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND WE HAVE MORE OF THE GOODNESS OF OF PEACE AND CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT AND THAT REENFORCES THE GENERATIVE DRIVE SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON AND IT IS NEVER FAILED ME YET TO READ OR LISTEN TO SOME ONE COMMUNICATING HAPPINESS EITHER WHAT THEY THINK IT IS HOW THEY FOUND IT WHAT THEY'R STRIVING FOR WHAT THEY THINK IT PHILOSOPHICALLY IS RIGHT IT'S ALL THAT RIGHT AND IT'S NOT AS AS SIMPLE AS A WORD RIGHT RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S COMPLEX WERE COMPLEX BUT THE BEAUTY OF IT ALL IS THE COMPLEXITY IS WITHIN US BUT IT'S NOT OUT OF OUR REACH TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES BETTER EN HEALP OURSELES AND IF WE DO THAT AS WE MOVE FURTHER UP THE HIERARCHY IT GETS SIMPLER APPROACHING THE WORLD THROUGH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS VERBS IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT'S WHY THAT'S THE BEST MATRIC FOR ROMANTIC COMPATIBILITY RIGHT IT'S NOT THIS PERSON PLAYS AMUSICAL INSTRUMENT AND THAT PERSONS A MATHEMATICIAN SO THE'RE NOT COMPATIBLE NO MORE THAN ONE PLAYS THE TRUMPET ONE PLAYS THAT DE CLARINETT AND WE ASSUME THEY ARE COMPATIBLE WHERE ARE THOSE DRIVES AT ORE PEOPLE HEALTHY IN A HEALTHY PLACE WE CAN THEN TAKE THE BEST CARE OF OURSELVES ENGAGE WITH OTHERS IN A HEALTHY WAY UNDERSTAND WHOSE A HEALTHY OTHER TO ENGAGE WITH RIGHT GET OURSELVES OUT OF UNHEALTHY SITUATIONS AND THAN WE'RE BUILDING HEALTH WITH IN OURSELVES AND AROUND OURSELVES AND THAT'S HOW AT THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EMERGENCE THINGS GET BETTER SO IF I MAKE MYSELF HEALTHIER AND YOU MAKE YOURSELF HEALTHIER WE WILL BE HEALTHIER AS A GROUP OF TO THAT'S ALWAYS HOW THAT IS AND FOR HEALTHIER AS A GROUP OF TOO WE CAN BE HEALTHIER AS PARTS OF LARGER GROUPS RIGHT IT WERE IF THE GROUPS ARE IN HEALTHY WE'RE PUSHING TOWARDS GREATER HEALTH I WERE ENGENDERING HEALTH AND THAT'S HOW WE SEE HEALTH GROW UNTIL IT CAN BE MANIFEST EVEN ON A CULTURAL LEVEL WE WERE TAKING BETTER CARE OF OURSELVES WE'RE LESS PUNITIVE WERE LESS RUSHING FORWARD AS A SOCIETY AND TRAMPLING THE VULNERABLE RIGHT AND WE REALIZE OH I COULD BE THE VULNERABLE RIGHT I CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE EVEN IF I DON'T KNOW THEM BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHISE WITH WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE VULNERABLE AND FURTHERMORE I COULD BE AMONG THE VULNERABLES WHO WE BEHAVED DIFFERENTLY AS A CULTURE AND THAT'S WHAT WERE SEARCHING FOR ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ALL THE WAY UP TO A CULTURAL LEVEL I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AM BUT FIRST I WANTID JUST A HIGHLIGHT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT RELATIONAL STRUCTURE RELATIONSHIPS AND THE FACT THAT AM AS WAS EXPLORED IN EPISODE THREE AND YOU MAY SO CLEAR AND IT JUST MAKE SO MUCH SENSE MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE EXPLORE FOR AND WHEN LOOKING FOR ROMANTIC PARTNER OR DETERMINING WHETHEROR NOT THER EXISTING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP COULD BE BETTER OR NOT IS FOCUSSED ON THE WRONG THINGS CRIED THESE THESE VERY COUNT OF SUPERFICIAL NOTIONS OF WHAT PEOPLE ENJOY AND EVEN LEVEL OF EDUCATION SOME OF WHICH CAN REALLY MATTER BUT THAT'S NOT THE CRITICAL ISSUE AT HAND AND THAT THE MAPS THAT THE TWO INDIVIDUALS HAVE IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THER ARE EXPRESSING THEIR GENERATIVE DRIVE AM AND AGENCY IN GRATITUDE IS FAR FAR MORE IMPORTANT AND SO FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T HEARD EPISODE THRH AND ARE INTERESTING RELATIONSHIPS NOT JUST ROMANCIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL KINDS WORK FAMILY RELATIONSHIP TO SELL FRIENDSHIP I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND LESSENING THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT'S AM IT'S TRULY SPECTACULAR IN TERMS OF ITS ACTION WILL TAKE AWAYS A IN BY ACTIONAL L I MEAN ACTIONS OF COURSE BEHAVIORS AND AND ALSO MODES OF THINKING THEY CAN REALLY A SERVE PEOPLE I ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION THAT A I I BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU SAID HIERKEY WHEN WHEN YOU SAID MOVE UP THE HIERKY AM YOU WERE REFERRING TO THE HIERKY WITHIN THE WITHIN THE MAP THAT'S BEEN LAID OUT HERE RIGHT I SUPPOSED IT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GET AM A MISTAKENLY A DISTRACTED BY THE THE POSSIBILITY WERETIKING BOUT SOME SORT OF LIKE EXTERNAL SOCIAL HIRKY AM SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT AND THAT'S I SHAY A PERFECT JUMPING OFF PLACE FOR A GOING INTO THE MAP WITH A LITWL BIT MORE A DEPTH AN DETAIL AM AND EXPLORING THESE CUPBOARDS THAT RESIDE AM AT THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE MAP AND THAT ARE QUITE COMPLEX SO CASE SO FOR THOSE OF YOU LISTENING WHO HAVE NOT YET GONE AND ACCESS TOF THE P D F THAT WE PUT IN THE SHOWNOT CAPTIONS AM YOU CAN DO THAT AT ANY POINT BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A BUNCH OF THINGS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM AUNDER THESE TWO PILLARS STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF THESE COVER CUPBOARDS EXCUSE ME THAT ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR ANY IN ALL OF US TO LOOK IN AND EXPLORE AND ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT'S WHAT RESIDES WITHIN THOSE CUPBOARDS THAT COMBINED IN A SORT OF RECIPE AND THEN GEISER UP INTO WEATHER OR NOT AND HOW MUCH EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENCY GRATITUDE PIECE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT ENGENERATIVE DRIVE WE ARE ABLE TO A EXERT AND AM AN EXPERIENCE FOR OURSELVES IN LIFE SO IMAGINE IN IN YOUR MINDS IF YOU WILL AM AND HERE ON BORROWING DIRECTLY FROM A A PICTURE MODEL THAT A DOCTOR CONTY PROVIDED A BEFORE THE A FILMING OF THE SERIES WHICH IS AN ICEBERG WHERE BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WATER RESIDES A BUNCH OF STUFF AND THEN A LITTLE BIT IS ABOVE THE WATER AND MAYBE HELP US REVISIT THAT MODEL NOW FOR A FEW MILK MOMENTS BUT IF YOU TAKE NOTHING AWAY AT THIS MOMENT A PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEX STOP GOING ON UNDEREATH THE SURFACE OF THE BRAIN AND MIND BUT A KEY FEATURE OF THIS MAP IS THAT WHELE IT IS VERY VERY COMPLEX UNDERNEATH WHAT EMERGES FROM THAT COMPLEXITY GET SIMPLER AND SIMPLER ESPECIALLY AS WE MOVE TOWARDS PLACES OF BETTER HEALTH AND MORE EFECTIVENESS AN LIFE AN SO IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU YOU KNOW DESCRIBE THE MAP IN A BIT MORE DETAIL ESPECIALLY WHAT'S DOWN THERE IN THESE PILLARS THE COMPLEX STUFF AND AND THE STUFF THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND THEN WE'LL TOUCH ON SOME OF THOSE CUPBOARDS THAT WE ALL HAVE AND THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD ALL WE ASKING IN THE CONTECTS OF SOME A COMMON CHALLENGES BUT ALSO SOME VERY COMMON AND VERY EFFECTIVE PATHS TO DOING AND FEELING BETTER YES YES THE THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS THE PLACE TO START IS THAT'S THE DEEPEST LEVEL OF THE STRUCTURE OF SELF SO IMAGINE IMAGINE SITTING ON TOP OF A BIOLOGICAL SUPERCOMPUTER THE SIZE OF A HOUSE RIGHT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US LIKE THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS THAT BIOLOGICAL SUPERCOMPUTER AND IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN OURSELVES WE BECOME VERY VERY CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN IT AND AI THAT'S WHERE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE TO US IT CAN BE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH OTHER WAY SUCH AS WE TALKED ABOUT REFLECTION OR THERAPEINCURS OR OTHER WAYS TOO BUT IT IS ACCESSIBLE TO US AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN IT BECAUSE WHAT IT IS IN IT HAS SUCH A STRONG EFFECT ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR CONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT THAT'S THE THE PERSON ON TOP OF THE BIOLOGICAL SUPERCOMPUTER OF THE SIZE OF A HOUSE OR THT THE THE IMAGE WE'VE BEEN USING IS THE TOP OF THE ICEBERG THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE WATER SO WE CAN LOOK AT THAT EITHER WAY BUT WHAT IS IN IT HAS OF COURSE A HUGE EFFECT ON THE PART THAT WE'RE AWARE OF ARE CONSCIOUS MIND AND I THINK THE BEST ANALOGY HERE AN SECY I THINK QUITE AAN ANNALOGY THAT PARALLELS VERY WELL IS TO AN ABSESS IN THE FIELD OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE SO AN ABSESS IS AN AREA OF WALLED OFF INFECTION RIGHT SO IMAGINE THAT THERE'S SOME INFECTION FOR EXAMPLES OFTEN IN THE APTIMEN ITHI S IT THERE'S SOME INFECTION AND THAT INFECTION COULD BE REALLY DANGEROUS RIGHT IF THAT INFECTION SPREAD BOY COULD GO TO THE BLOOD THE PERSON COULD A COULD DIE FROM THAT RIGHT SO THE BODY DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF WALLING OFF THAT INFECTION RIGHT AND THEN THAT'S A GOOD THING RIGHT BECAUSE IF THE INFECTION WEREN'T WALLED OFF IT POSES HUGE RISK BUT THE WALLED OFF INFECTION DOES NOT REPRESENT A CONDITION OF HEALTH SO SOMEONE WHO HAS AN ABSESS IN THEM AND DOES IT KNOW IT THIS HAPPENS FREQUENTLY IN MEDICINE IS SEE PEOPLE COMING TO EMERGENCY ROOMS AND YOU KNOW THEY'VE A LOW GRAT FEVER AND THE'VE AT A LOW GREAT FEVER FOR A WHILE AND THIS DON'T FEEL GOOD AND THEY HAVE LOW ENERGY AND THEY'RE NOT SLEEPING WELL THEY FIND THEMSELVES SWEATING A LOT THEIR PERVASIVE EXPERIENCEIS GOING ON THAT ARE REALLY DETRACTING FROM LIFE LIKE NOT FEELING GREAT ALL THE TIME EVEN THOUGH THE PERSON DOESNIT FEEL REALLY SICK THAT SOMETIMES WHY IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THE PERSON TO COME TO MEDICAL ATTENTION SO WHAT'S GOING ON IS BETTER THAN NOT BEING WALLED OFF BUT IT IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH HEALTH SO WHAT HAPPENS IN PHYSICAL MEDICINE ABSESSES IDENTIFIED AND THEN SOME ONE GOES IN A SURGEON GOES IN AND DRAINS IT AND THEN THE PERSON IS BETTER RIGHT THAT THINK ABOUT THAT PROCESS LIKE SURGERY I SURGERY'S NOT A FUN THING RIGHT THERE'S AN ESTHESIA THERE'S RECOVERY RIGHT BUT SURGERY IS GREAT WHEN IT CURES THE PROBLEM RIGHT SO IT'S NOT THAT O THA THE THE PHYSICIAN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE THE FAMILY PRACTISED DOT  IDENTIFIES THAT THERE'S AN ABSESS REFER TO THE SURGEON EVERYTHING IS GREAT AND HAPPY AND THEIR BETTER NO THEY HAVE TO GO OUT A SURGERY AND THAT'S NOT AN EASY THING RIGHT BUT IF THEY GO AND DO THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE THE INFECTION ACTUALLY IS GONE SO THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SYMPTOMS THAT IT WAS CONSTANTLY SPINNING OFF INSIDE OF THEM AND THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE THE RISK THAT MAYBE THAT INFECTION GETS OUT OF THE ABSESS AND EN THER THEIR LIFE IS THEN AT RISK SO THAT THE PARALLEL IS LOOKING INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO WHAT IS INSIDE OF US THAT MAY BE ACTING LIKE THAT ABSESS EVEN THOUGH THIS IS AN ANALOGY IT IS NOT THEORETICAL  THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND THE ABSESS INSIDE THAT PERSON EMOTIONALLY MAY BE THE BULLING THAT WENT ON RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF PUBRIRTY IT IT MAY BE THAT AWFUL BOSS WHO IS JUST SO MEAN AND LIKE TOOK THAT GOOD JOB AWAY FROM ME IH IT MIGHT BE THAT IT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW THAT ASSAULT THAT I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT'S REALLY STILL WITH ME IT MIGHT BE THAT DEATH I STILL FEEL GUILTY ABOUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT IF THERE'S AN ABSESS IN THERE WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT AND THEN FIX IT CURE IT I AND THAT'S WHAT THE THERAPY PROCESS CAN DO AND THAT'S WHY AT TIMES OF THERAPE IS UNPLEASANT YOU KNOW THE CRYING AND THE ANGERING OF THAT'S THE PARALLEL OF GOING THROUGH THE SURGERY RIGHT BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE WE'VE DISSIPATED THE ENERGY INSIDE OF ITLIKE WEV WI'F WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF IT AND AND THAT'S WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO GO INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IF THEIR THINGS THAT ARE REALLY TROUBLING US OR IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON TO CAST THE NET OF INQUIRY THAT MAY LEAD US THERE BECAUSE TRAMA IS SO COMMON AND WE SHOVE DRAMA UNDERNEATH THE SURFAS BECAUSE OF THE GUILT AND SHAME THAT IT GENERATES AND THEN IT STAYS IN US LIKE AND ABSESS AND SPENDS OFF SYMPTOMS THEY COULD BE SYMPTOMS OF DIFFIDENCE THEY COULD BE SYMPTOMS OF OVERUSING A SUBSTANCE THEY COULD BE SYMPTOMS OF AVOIDING GOOD THINGS IN OUR LIFE BUT THE THE PERVASIVE SYMPTOMS THAT ARE REALLY HARMFUL TO US THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND AND TIKS IN ADDITION TO QUALITY THERAPY WHAT ARE SOME OTHER WAYS TO ACCESS THE UNCONSCIOUS EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT JOURNALING AND SPELLING OUT ONCE'S LIFE NARRATIVE IN WRITTEN OR IN SPOKEN FORM EITHER ALONE OR WITH HA TRUSTED OTHER LET'S ASSUME THAT SOMEBODY EITHER CAN'T AFFORD OR IS JUST NOT AT THE PLACE WHERE THEYARE WILLING TO DO THERAPY YET AM BUT THEY FULLY ADOPT THIS ABSESS MODEL THAT A ORE THIS ABSESSANALOGY AM THAT YOU DESCRIBED TO THINK IS AN EXCEPTIONAL ONE BECAUS AM A YOU HAVE THE AAN TWENTY PLUSS YEARS OF CLENICAL EXPERIENCE KNOWING THIS EXISTS BUT ALSO A I THINK WE ALL AT SOME LEVEL AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR STUFF HAPPENING WITHIN US THAT WE CAN'T EXPLAIN AND AND IZO NURALSCINGEST CAN ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT YOU MOST OF THE NERAL MACHINERY IN YOUR HEAD A AND THE PARTS OF IT THAT ARE IN YOUR BODY LIK WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT I W LOVE TO THINK THAT WE DO BUT BUT WE DON'T IS JUST CLICKING AWAY UNDER THERE SO LET'S SAY SOMEBODY WANTS TO AM MAKE SOME PROGRESS THE IMPROVE THEIR LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH MORE OBTAIN MORE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE OND PROVE ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE THAN THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WHAT ARE SOME WAYS THAT THEY CAN START TO TAPPINTO THE UNCONSCIOUS AM AND MY GUESSES IF IT'S NOT IN THERAPY IT'S GOING TO BE BY LOOKING AT SOME IN SOME OF THESE OTHER COVERTS AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING THEM RIGHT YES DEVELOP AN EMBRACE CURIOSITY ABOUT YOURSELF IAND IF YOU CAN GO FOR THAT CURIOSITY BEING DISPASSIONTE I IN IN IN THE SENSE THAT YOU MAY TALK BY THESE FILES YOU HAVE WITH YOU WITH A MEMORIES AND EVENTS FROM YOUR PASSLIKG THAT'S SO GOOD BECAUSE YOUARE EXPLORING YOUR LIFE I SO SO SOMEONE WHO WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES BETTER DO THAT FOR YOURSELF GO LOOK AT PICTURES TALK TO PEOPLE YOU KNEW AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF LIFE REFLECT UPON HOW YOU BEHAVE THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF LIFE WHAT YOU FELT INSIDE ANCER YOURSELF TO MEMORIES AN AN EXTRAP LATE FROM THERE BECOME CURIOUS ABOUT YOURSELF AND IF YOU CAN BE THIS PASSION AT THIS IDEA THAT SOMETIMES GETS CALLED AN OBSERVING EGO RIGHT THERE OTHER WORDS TO PUT TO IT BUT IT'S IT'S NOT EGOE IN A NEGATIVE SENSE RIGT HERE IT MEANS THE ABILITY TO STAND OUTSIDE OF ONESELF AND GO RIGHT AND TO REALLY THINK ABOUT ONESELF WITHOUT THE NEGATIVE EMOTION WERE OFTEN ABLE TO EITHER SEE THE TRAMA FOR EXAMPLE OR SEE THE CHANGE LIKE WHY DID I GO FROM FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT MYSELF AND THEY I FELT LIKE I COULD DO ANYTHING AND THEN THIS A COUPLE YEARS LATER AND I LOOK AT ME I MOPY IN THE PICTURES AND YOU KNOW AN TANTHIN  I WAS DRINKING MORE I STOP TON'T CARE MYSELF LIKE THAT'S A PRETTY BIG CHANGE RIGHT AND THEN CERTAIN SENALIC WERE CALLING ATTENTION WHAT'S THAT CHANGE AND LOT TIMES A PERSON KNEW IT YOU IKE ALI GOT REJECTED I THAT TERRIBLE BREAK UP RIGHT AND TI IT THEY ALWTHEY KNEW IT WAS A TERRIBLE BREAKER BUT THEY KEEP SHOVING IT UNDER THE SURFACE MAYBE THEY TIDN'T KNOWT WAS THE TERRIBLE BREAK UP MAYBE THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS LIKE THAT'S O HAY RIGHT EVEN IF THEY RECOGNIZE LOOK THERE WAS A CHANGE THEN THAT WILL PUT THE LIE TO WHAT IN THIS EXAMPLE IS LIKELY GOING ON SO THAT PERSON LIKELY FRAMES THEMSELVES IN A WAY THAT IS VERY NEGATIVE AND ALWAYS WAS TRUE RIGHT SO SO II CAN NEVER ACHIEVE ANYTHING I NEVER FEEL GOOD NO ONE LIKES ME AND CAN'T FIND A PART OF WHATEVER IT IS WE SAY TO OURSELFS THE PRESEN EX IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY RIGHT BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE EMOTION IS SO STRONG AN THAT PART OF OUR BRAIN DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE CLOCK IN THE CALENDAR AND THN THE PERSON GOES BACK AND THINKS IT WAS NOT ALWAYS THAT WAY RIGHT AND IT COMES TO THIS A LOT AND THERAPY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AS YOU SAID IN THERAPY BUT NO YOU KNOW I WAS A GO GETTER RIGHT AGI I NIGGOF THE PERSON IS THAIT I WAS A GO GETTER AND I WENT OUT THERE AN DIDTINGS WHICH PUT THE LIE TO HER SAYING THAT YOU WAS LAZY AND CAPABLE ALTHOGH SON THAT WERE NOT TRUE BUT SHE ACCEPTED AS TRUTH RIGHT SO SHE NEEDED FROM THAT MATHEMATICAL PERSPECTID LIK TO GO BACK AND QUESTION THE GIVENS RIGHT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WERE SAYING GO LOOK IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND GO LOOK IN THAT PART OF THE PILLAR OF THE STRUCTURE OF SELF GO LOOK THERE THAT'S THE DEEPEST PART THE MOST COMPLICATED PART BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND IF WE START TO GAIN UNDERSTANDING THAN WE CAN THINK MORE ABOUT THE CONSCIOUS MINE LIKE WHAT WAYS I CAN WHAT AM I THINKING ABOUT WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHT HAVE I REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TERES IT JUST RUNNING OVER AND OVER IN MY HAD WHAT WOULD I LIKE TO DO ABOUT IT MAYBE I' LIKE TO LEARN MORE MAY BHEY WANT TO GO GET A BOOK THAT I THINK COULD HELP ME LISTEN TO ANOTHER POTCAST THAT COULD HELP ME TALK TO A FRIEND LIKE MAYBE I WANT TO DO THOSE THINGS SO NOW THE FLOW BETWEEN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND THE CONSCIOUS MIND RIHT BECOMES MUCH MORE ROBUST AND THAT LETS US LOOK FURTHER RIGHT TO LOOK AT THE NEXT LEVEL UP THE DEFENCE MECHANISMS THAT GROW UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND AND WE CAN HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE UNCONSCIOUS RIGHT SO THE IDEA OF WAT WHAT WHEN THAT WHEN SOMETHING SHIFTED IN ME HOW DID MY WAY OF ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD KIND OF CHANGE YOU KNOW LIKE I WAS PERSEVERIN AND IM YOU KNOW I WOULD TAKE SOME OF THAT ENERGY IN ME THAT WASN'T SO GOOD AND MEMOR I COULD PUT IT INTIL I EXERCISING TAKING CARE OF MYSELF AND THEN YOU KNOW THEN THAT SORT IS SHIFTED AND I BECAME SARSARCASTIC AND CYNICAL AND AN I STARTED AVOIDING NO THOSE OF MY FRIEND WHO ARE REALLY TAKIN CARE OF THEMSELVES IN DOING WELL BECAUSE I'T MADE ME FEOR WORSE ABOUT MYSELF SO SO THAT'S A DIALOGUE THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF DEFENCE MECHANISMS NOW THE PERSON ISN'T CNESSERLY SAY OH I USED A LOT OF SUBLEMATION WHICH IS GOOD AN THEN I STARTED USING REACTION FORMATION AND AVOIDANCE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE RIGHT BUT THEY CUN UNDERSTAND THAT IN IN WORDS THAT THEY CAN WHATEVER WORDS THEY PUT TO IT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS A CHANGE THEY CAN START PUTTING THEY PUT WORDS TO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THAT PROCESS OF CHANGE IS NOT OPAQUE THEIR SHINING LIGHT ON IT AND NOW THEY CAN GAIN IT BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IT AND THEY CAN CHANGE IT EVEN THAT REALIZATION THAT I WAS MUCH MORE FUNCTIONAL THINGS WE'RE DIFFERENT I MEAN THAT CAN BE A TREASURE TROVE OF VERY RELEVANT VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY POSITIVE INFORMATION TO BRING TO THE CURRENT SITUATION I THINK WE OFTEN ROMANCE THE IDEA OF THE PERSON WHO CAN JUST LIVE LIFE FORWARD WHO DOESN'T LOOK BACK I HO JUST DOESN'T REALLY EXPLORE THEIR PASSAG JUST ACTION ORIENTED BECAUSE AFTER ALL WHEN WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING ALL WE CAN CONTROL RE ACTIONS GOING FORWARD WE CAN'T RESCRIPT THE ACTIONS OF PAST OURS OR OTHERS THAT IS SUCH A GOOD POINT OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE JUST LOOKING FORWARD WE BECOME LIKE A SPRINTER WHO COMES OUT OF THE BLOCKS TOO FAST SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF A HUNDRED HUNDRED METER DASH THEY'RE THE BEST PRINTERS IN THE WORLD SAY RIGHT AND THERE THEY ARE IN THE BLOCKS AND IF THEY COME OUT OF THOSE BLOCKS IN THE RIGHT WAY THEY WILL GAIN MOMENTUM THEY WILL KEEP THEIR FORM AND THEY WILL RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN BUT IF THEY DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS BEHIND THEM THE BLOCKS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THEIR BODY RIGHT THE WHOLE BIGGER PICTURE HERE OF THE LIMITATIONS WITHIN THE BODY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THOSE LIMITATIONS ARE THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES THAT'S HOW THEY AVOID COMING OUT OF THE BLOCKS SO FAST AND THEN SPRAWLING HEADLONG ON TO THE TRACK AND WE SEE THAT HAPPEN TOO SO IF WE'RE JUST LOOKING FORWARD AND THOUGHT AN IDEA THAT'S HOW TO LIVE LIFE WE WILL BE TRIPPING FORWARD AND ULTIMATELY WILL BE LIKE THAT SPRINTER NO MATTER HOW GREAT A SPRINTER IF YOU COME OUT OF THE BLOCKS TOO FAST YOU CAN TRIP FORWARD YES I NOY SAID THIS IN A DIFFERENT FORM A FEW MINUTES AGO BUT THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF SELF INQUIRY BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T WANT THE THING THAT THEY DISCOVER WHICH RESIDES IN THEIR UNCONSCIOUS THE ABSESS IF YOU WILL OR THE A THE DAMAGING THOUGHT OR THING THAT HAPPENED WHICH THEY ARE AWARE OF BUT ARE PUSHING DOWN TO TAKE OVER THEIR DAILY LIFE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO BE AT LEAST AS FUNCTIONAL AS THEY ARE IN THE MOMENT IF YOU GO VISIT THE PERSON WHO HAD THE ABSESS CURED BY THE SURGEON ON POSTOP DAY ON THT PERSON WILL BE LESS FUNCTIONAL  THEY'LL E IN A HOSPITAL BED I TTHEY WON'T BE ABLE TO GET UP OUT OF THE BED H WON'T BE ABLE TO EXERCISE WO GOING TO FEEL EARING TO FILL THEIR BEST I THAT'S OU K I IT IS OU K THAT WE AT TIMES CAN BECOME INTERMITTENTLY SAY LESS FUNCTIONAL RIGT IN THE SENSE THAT WERE MORE UPSET AND I'LL SPENDY MORE TIME CRYING Y THAT'S OAU K BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE ENERGY THE EFFORT THE CHOICE THAT GETS US TO A BETTER PLACE OCA SO IT'S CLEAR TO ME WHY EXPLORING THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND CAN BE AN REALLY IS IMMENSELY VALUABLE IS JUST I'M CONVINCED AND A I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY ONE OUT THERE WHOWOULD DISAGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT GETTING BETTER MENTALLY BEING ABLE TO FUNCTION BETTER IN THE WORLD AS A CONSEQUENCE IT IS NOT A TERRIFIC USE OF ONE'S TIME EVEN IF IT A YOU KNOW AT THE SURFACE SEEMS TO TAKE US OFF COURSE A BIT IN IN THE MOMENT OR THAT FOR EVEN A FEW DAYS AND I THINK IT'S ALSO A WORTH HIGH LIGHTING THAT IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT IF WE DO AN EXPLORATION OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND OR LOOKIN ANY OF THESE CUPBOARDS FOR THAT MATTER THAT OUR ENTIRE DAY IS GOING TO BE OVERTAKEN BY IT OR ALL OF OUR SLEEP IS GOING TO DISAPPEAR WE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT AM A A PROCESS IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS DEVOTED TO EXPLORING THESE CUPBOARDS AY THERE ARE INSTANCES OF COURSE WHERE SOMEONE HITS A CRISIS AND THEY SIMPLY CAN'T FUNCTION BUT IN THAT CASE THE THING THEY ABSOLETE ME TO DO IS TO LOOK IN THESE COPBOARDS T WHAT ARE SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN EXPLORE THIS OTHER CUPBOARD UNDER THE PILLAR OF STRUCTURE OF SELF A WHICH IS THE CUPBOARD OF THE CONSCIOUS MIND SO WE CAN ALSO APPROACH THIS THROUGH THTHE CURIOSITY OF SELF WE DO A LOT OF THINGS AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT THAT WE CAN STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT WHY DO I DO THAT THING RIHT AND IT'S AMAZING WHAT THAT CAN PROVIDED RIHT SO FOR EXAMPLE I'M U'M WORKING WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN GOING TO WORK FOR A LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG TIME RIGHT DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO WORK A LONG TIME AGO RIGHT AND THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS THIS PERSON WANTS TO DO WITH THER LIFE THERE CURIOUS ABOUT THINGS THEY WANT TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH OLDER PEOPLE IN THEIR FAMILY RIGHT BUT THEY HAD TO STOP AND THINK WHY AM I GOING TO WORK RIGHT NOW HE'S FORTUNAT ENOUGH THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO HE ALSO EARNED AND HE'S HE'S HOT WORKING HE'S DILIGENT HY'S FORTUNATE BUT HE HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT HE'S BEEN GOING TO WORK AUTOMATICALLY FOR A LONG TIME AND IT WAS THE THINKING ABOUT IT THAT THAT MADE HIM MILL AS II DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY NOT WHY BECAUSE IT'S ROOTED IN IN UNCONSCIOUS THINGS BUT THAT HE'S NOW BRINGING TO CONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT BECAUSE I VALUE HARD WORK AND I VALUE DILIGENCE  BUT HEM STOP WORKING DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE'S NOT HE KNOW HE'S NOT INATELY HARD WORKING YOUR DILIGENT HE SHOWED THAT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND HE CAN SHOW IT IN OTHER WAYS LIKE BY YOU KNOW HOW HE WANT TO BE ATTENTIVE TO OLDER PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP K IS A LOT HE CAN DO BUT HE HID TO GO BACK AND LOOK AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A REASON WHY HE DIDN'T REALIZE IT RIGHT AND EVEN THOUG IT'S NOT EVEN A BAD REASON BUT BUT CLUE THOSE THAT AN OVERVALUE OF HARD WORKING DILIGENT AND HE DIDN'T REALIZE OH LIKE I'VE DONE THAT RI I'VE DONE ENOUGH THAT I'VE CONVINCE MYSELF I KNOW HIM HARD WORKING I KNOW HIM DILIGENCE O ID ENOUGH TO SO TO SERVE THAT INTERNAL MASTER ANY MORE A I CAN STEP AWAY AND NOW HIS WHOLE LIFE IS CHANGED BUT HOW THE CHANGE COME ABOUT BY ASKING WHAT MIGHT ONE MIGHT THINK IS SUCH A S SIMPLE QUESTION TO MAKE NO SENSE LIKE WHY DO I GO TO WORK EACH DAY WHY HAVE I BEEN GOING HE'S HE'S OFF ON THE ROAD TO CHANGE SO SO THAT'S IT'S ONE ASPECT OF OF HOW WE CAN EXPLORE IT THE CONSCIOUS MINDID OFTEN LEAD US BACK TO THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT BUT IT'S A WARENESS OF OUR CONSCIOUS CHOICES I WE CAN ALSO THEN USE TACTIC SO FOR EXAMPLE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR O TACTICS LIKE THOUGHT REDIRECTION LIKE IF I'M AWARE THAT I'S A THOUGHT THAT COMES INTO MY MIND A LOT AND I STOT LEARNING WAYS I CAN READ IRECT AWAY FROM IT INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT IT A HUNDRED TIMES RIGHT AND IF I LEARN HOW TO DO THAT THERE'S LESS OF A NEGATIVE EMOTION THAT COMES FROM THINKING ABOUT IT AND AND I CAN START TO FEEL BETTER IS THE BASIC PREMISE OF IT BUT THESE ARE TECHNIQUES THAT CAN REALLY HELP US AND THEY INVOLVE UNDERSTANDING AND GUIDING THE CONSCIOUS MIND I'M SMILING BECAUSE AM RECALLING AND EXPERIENCE I HAD I'VE A FEMALE FRIEND WHO VERY IMPRESSIVE PERSON REALLY A AS OVERCOMATON A IS A RECOVERED ALCOHOLIC FOR MANY YEARS EM AND TIKES AT LEAST BY MY REGREAT CARE OF HERSELF AND THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND HER AND AS SPECTACULAR SENTS OF HUMOUR AND A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS BUT IS POLLY FIVE SIX YEARS AGO THAT WE WERE IN CONVERSATION ABOUT SOMETHING I DON'T RECALL WHAT AND OUT OF APPARENTLY NOWHERE SHE SHE SAID I HATE BEING BUSY AND IT JUST STOP ME IN MY TRACKS BECAUSE I'M SOMEBODY WHO AM KEEPS VERY VERY BUSY I MY SCHEDUL IS EXTREMELY FULL WITH THINGS THAT I REALLY ENJOY SOME THINGS I DON'T ENJOY OR ENJOY LASS BUT I'M FORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT MY LIFE MOSTLY THINGS THAT I ENJOY AT THE TIME I WAS VERY VERY BUSY WITH MANY THINGS INCLUDING MANY THINGS I DIDN'T ENJOY AND HER STATEMENT JUST HALTED ME AND I REALIZE YOU MAYBE I DON'T HAVE TO BE BUSY LIKELYKE WHAT THIS WHOLE NOTION OF DOING A BUNCH OF THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO I SURE WE'VE TO MAKE OUR WAY IN THE WORLD AND MAKE A LIVING AND TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES AN OTHERS BUT BUT I REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF EXTRA STUFF THAT I WAS DOING R THINK BUT WHAT SHE MEANT AND WHAT YOU WERE REFLECTING ON WAS I HATE BEING AUTOMATICALLY BUSY RIGHT RIHT IT'S NOT GOOD TO BE AUTOMATICALLY BUSY AND THE N IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT WAY HOW MIGH BUSY IN WAYS THAT ARE GOOD FOR ME AND HOW MY BUSY IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT I'M I JUST TAKING UP TIME YOU KNOW TO AVOID SOMETHING USED I REALLY THINKING ABOUT IT YES AND THE CONVERSATION STAYS WITH ME TO THIS DAY BECAUSE UP UNTIL THEN I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMBERE A LOT OF THE THINGS I WERE DOING WE'RE TRULY A WASTE OF MY TIME I IT MOSTLY BECAUSE I COULD BE PUTTING THAT ENERGY AND TO GENERATIVE YOUTHINGS MY GENERATIVE TRIVE SINGS THAT WOULD BRING ME AGENCY GRATITUDE PEASE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT THESE SORTS OF THINGS WHAT I'M GIVING US AN EXAMPLE I REALIZES QUITE DIFFERENT THAN SITTING DOWN IN A CHAIR AND ASKING ONESELF QUESTIONS ABOUT O ONE'SELF AND AND ONE'S SCADUAL IS SAME AS DOING SAYMEN BUT ITWRIT SAME EN POINT AND AND I BRING IT UP BECAUSE UM I THINK IT WAS THE FACT THAT IT STOPPED ME IN MY TRACKS BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT I CAN'T SEEM TO FORGET IT THAT MEANS THAT IT MUST HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANCE AND AND I WOULD SAY HAS HAD SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH A SEEING THESE A THE NEWS ARTICLES TOT COME OUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WOMAN OR MAN YOU KNOW HUNDR AND FOR REFLECTS ON WHAT REALLY MATTERED IN LIFE AND IT'S IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS THE SAME THINGS IS LIKE CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS AT WHAT YOU NO ONE ON THEIR DEATH BED SAYS I WISH I SPEND MORE TIME AT WORK I MIGHT BE ONE EXCEPTION I TIOUL REALLY ENJOY MY WORK SO WHENEVER I SEE THAT ONE ALWAYS THINK KNOW LIKE MY LIFE WITHOUT MY LIFE'S WORK IT WWOULDOULD BEEN A DIMINISHD LIFE FOR ME U AND ITHER OTHERS OUT THERE IS WELL BUT I THINK IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO PLACE OURSELVES INTO THE FUTURE OF A PERSON ON OUR DEATH BED LOOKING BACK AND THEN MAKE REALLY GOOD DECISIONS NOW I THINK THEREARE ALWAYS TO DO THAT BUT IT SEEMS THAT IT'S FAR MORE POWERFUL TO JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT AM I DOING NOW AND AND MAKES THEM YOU KNOW AND COME TO SOME REALIZATIONS ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY A VALUE NOW AND WHAT IS OF LESS VALUE OR NOW VALUE NOW AND THEN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS NOW BHE  A SUPPOSE TO DOING THE DEATH BED EXERCISE YOU'VE NO OTHER UPTION IF YOU'RE GING TO MAKE CHANGE JIMMY THINK ABOUT WHAT A COMPLICATED AND ULTIMATELY MEANINGLESS EXERCISE IT IS TO TRY AND PROJECT AHEAD INTO A FUTURE WHEN ONE IS ON ONE'S DEATH BED AND WHAT IS THAT LIKE I CLAWEN WEWE CAN' IMAGINE THAT WE DON'T WHOSE THERE LIKE WHATEVER THAT SITUATION MAY BE FOR ANY OF US SOM CAN BE WHAT WE IMAGINE SO THAT WE JUST MAKE SOMETHING UP AND WE TRY IN WHAT EXTRAPILAED OUR LIVES IN A WAY THAT THAT GETS US TO THIS PLACE WHERE WERE ON OUR DEATH BED WERE NOT UNHAPPY O KAE JUST BRINGS US RIGHT BACK TO THE FUTURE LIKE BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY SIMPLE RIGHT THAT IS SO COMPLICATED WHAT THINGS CAN BE LIKE ON OUR DEATH BED WHAT WILL HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN ALL THINGS I DON'T KNOW SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLY COMPLICATED SO THEN YOU TAKE IT BACK TO THAT TO THE PRESENT RIGHT LIKE WHAT IS IT I'M CHOOSING I AM THE EYE RIGHT NOW THAT IS MOVING THROUGH TIME ORS ON THE LUGE OF LIFE OR EVER WE WANT A SAY SO WHAT AM I CHOOSING RIGHT NOW THAT'S HOW WE MAKE OUR LIES BETTER TAND WE'RE WARE OF COURSE I KNOW THERE'S A FUTURE ON WON A LEAD TOWARDS A BETTER FUTURE I I CAN'T A OM A CRYSTAL BALL I CAN'T VISION WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE BUT I CAN DO MY BEST NOW TO GUIDE MY LIFE AS BEST I CAN AND THAT'S CAING O HAVE TO LEAD ME TO THE BEST FUTURE WHAT WHATEVER ALL THE VARIABLES ARE THAT I DON'T KNOW YET THE NEXT CUPBOARD UNDER THE PILLAR OF STRUCTURE OF SELF IS DEFENSE MECHANISMS I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT DEFENSE MECHANISMS BUT THE FIRST QUESTION IS CAN WE BE AWARE OF OUR DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND IS THERE VALUE IN THAT AND IF SO WHICH DEFENSE MECHANISMS OUR ACCESSIBLE TO US AND I GUESS THE THIRD QUESTION WOULD BE HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT EXPLORING DEFENSE MECHANISMS WELL ITS SORT OF FANTASTICAL IMAGERY IT THAT THERE'S THIS ICEBERG RIGHT PART IS UNDERWATER PART IS ABOVE WATER AND THEN FROM THE PART THAT'S UNDER WATER COME THESE ER BRANCHES RIGHT SO SO THE WAY I IMAGINE IT IS THERE THEIR BRANCHES OF ICE THAT CAN BE CLEAR AND HAVE LIGHT PASSE THROUGH THEM IN A WAY THAT IS HIGH FIDELITY I WHER THEY CAN BE SORT OF TWISTED AND UNCLEAR ND THEY DISTORT THE LIGHT THAT PASSES THROUGH THEM T THEY RISE UP FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND MEANING DEFENSES AR UNCONSCIOUS THEIR AUTOMATIC BUT THEY'RE NOT OUTSIDE OF OUR ABILITY TO GO LOOKING FOR THEM ORTHER IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND SO SO IT'S NOT THAT WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEM IS THAT THEIR ELUSIVE AND THERE HAS TO BE A PROCESS OF INQUIRY BUT WE CAN LEARN ABOUT THEM JUST LIKE WE CAN LEARN ABOUT OTHER THINGS IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND  AND HERE AGAIN KNOWLEDGE IS POWER SO IAM NOT GOING TO LEARN ANYTHING NEW FROM UNLIKELY TO LEARN ANYTHING NEW ABOUT MY DEFENSE MECHANISMS IF I DON'T THINK ABOUT THEM I BUT IF I START TO THINK ABOUT THEM THEN I CAN START TO LEARN THINGS AND TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS YOU KNOW HOW AM I BEHAVING NOW AS OPPOSED TO BEFORE DO I NOTICE THAT LIKE HOW COPING WALSTMEN THINK COPING BUT COPING IS CONSCIOUS BUT WE CAN ACCESS THAT HOW AM I COPING WHAT AM I DOING AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN SO SO FOR EXAMPLE SOME ONE WHOAFTER SOME DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE IHT THEN STARTS AVOIDING I CAND BE DOING THAT WITHOUT AN AWARENESS OF IT AVOIDANCE IS A DEFENCE SO AVOIDANCE OF SITUATIONS OR PEOPLE OR POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EMOTION I SO SELF REFLECTION CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND WHICH DEFENSE MECHANISMS WERE USING AND WHAT MAY HAVE CHANGED IN US SO AN EXAMPLE IN EXAMPLY SEE ALL THE TIME IS SOME ONE WHO SAY HAD AS A PRIMARY DEFENSE MECHANISM SUBLIMATION BEFORE SOME DIFFICULT EVENT AND SUBLIMATION IS TAKING ENERGY TAKING SAY ECCESS AGGRESSION TURNING IT INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE I IT IT'S A GOOD WAY OF HANDLING DISTRESS WITHIN US ITS HEALTHY I AND NOW AFTER SOME CHANGE IN THEIR LIFE THEY FIND THAT SAY THEY'RE DRINKING MORE AND THET THER THEYE WERELYING MORE AND MORE ON ALCOHOL YOU MIGHT SAY WELL THEIR SOOTHING WITH ALKOHOL YES THEIR SOOTHING WITH ALKOHOL IN ONE SENSE BUT WHAT ELSE MIGHT THAT MEAN RIGHT AND OFTENTIMES WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS TAY THE PERSON IS USING ALCOHL BECAUSE THE MAT IT SOMEONE THERE PUNISHING SOME ONE THAT SOMEONE IS PROBABLY THEM THEY GET TO HAVE THE SHORT TERM SOOTHING BUT THEN TO FEEL WORSE ABOUT THEMSELVES THE NEXT DAY RIGHT AND THE ALCOHOL IS IN PART A SEARCH FOR SOOTHING BUT IT'S IMPART AN ACTING OUT AGAINST THE SELF WHICH IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF DEFENSE MECHANISM THAT IS NOT HEALTHY SO THE PROCESS OF REFLECTION OR OF INQUIRY CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THE BRANCHES THAT ARE COMING UP FROM THE ICEBERG FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND HOW ARE THEY IN ME ARE THEY ARRANGED IN A WAY THAT SUT OV ELEGAN END AND THE'RE CLEAR AND THE LIGHTEST PASSING THROUGH THEM RATHER THINGS THAT IT BECOME O TWISTED OR ET WHAT IS THAT WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT HOW DO I GO CHANGE THATRIGHT I DON'T WANT THAT BRANCH THAT A SORT OF OPAQUE AND THAT THE LIGHT CAN'T GET THROUGH OR IS DISTORTED US SO SO I CAN GO LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH DEFENSE MECHANISMS ARE UNCONSCIOUS IF I'M WORKING ON MYSELF I CAN TAKE AWAY THAT SO TO SPEAK DISEASED BRANCH RIGHT OR THAT BRANCH THAT'S NOT HEALTHY AND PUT IN ITS PLACE SOMETHING HEALTHIER THAT'S HOW WE CAN CHANGE OUR DEFENSIVE STRUCTIURE RIGT THOSE BRANCHES OF OUR DEFENCE MECHANISMS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE UNCONSCIOUS WE CAN REFLECT ON THEM BRING THEM TO CTO CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN BRING OURSELVES TO BEAR TO MAKE OURSELVES HEALTHIER AND IT CAN INDEED GET HEALTHIER AND AS IT GETS HEALTHIER IT EFFECTS OF THE NEXT LEVEL AROUND IT WHICH IS THE PERSON'S CHARACTER STRUCTURE SO REMEMBERING WE'RE USING FANTASTICAL IMAGRY RIGHT BECAUSE AROUND THE ICEBERG BLOWING ABOVE THE WATER AND THE BRANCHES THAT COME OUT OF THE PART OF THE ISBURG UNDER THE WATER AND HOW THEY ARRAY THEMSELVES WERE IMAGINING THAT THERE'S A NEST THAT'S ENCOMPASSING ALL THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND THE CONSCIOUS MIND THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND THAT NEST IS THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE IT'S A WAY THAT WE CONTAIN AND DEFINE THE SELF THAT RIDES ON TOP OF EVERYTHING IT IS INTO THAT NEST THAT THE SELF SETTLES AND FROM WHICH THE SEL GROWS BECAUSE THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS MORE THAN JUST THE CONSCIOUS MIND IT'S O THE CONSCIOUS MIND IN ACTION THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN ACTION ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IN ACTION AND THEN THAT'S HOW WE BE THINKBE AS AN ACTIVE WORD RIGHT THAT'S HOW WE ARE OR THAT'S HOW WE ACTIVELY BE IN THE WORLD HOW WERE ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD SO YOU DESCRIBE THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE AS THE NEST THAT IS UP ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE THESE UNCONSCIOUS DEFENCES AND ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF WHAT COMES FROM BELOW THEN YOU ALSO SAID THAT THE SELF OUR SELVES RESIDE IN THAT NEST AND YOU AND I DON'T RECALL THE EXACT WORD AND BUT YOU SAID SOMETHING TO THE EXTENT OF U KNOW THE SELF GROWS WITHIN THAT NEST YES AND AS YOU SAID THAT I IMMEDIATELY HAD THE IMAGE IN MIND OF A NEST THAT IS EITHER INCREDIBLY NURTURING AND CAN REALLY FOSTER THE SELF AND ITS BEST WAYS AND CAN GIVE RISE TO EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENCY GRATITUDE PEACE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT GENERATIVE DRIVE ALLTHESE WONDERFUL THINGS I ALSO IMAGINED A NEST THAT AM YOU KNOW ISN'T AS CLEAN AS IT COULD BE OR THAT HAS SOME HOLES IN IT AM  OR THAT AM ISN'T STABLE IN THE WIND AND THESE SORTS OF THINGS A IS THAT SORT OF IMAGERY THAT'S COMING TO MIND FOR ME AS IT S AT BU A DECENT THE WAY TO CONCEPTIONALIZEUS YES AND I THINK THIS IS  IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THE SELF NESTS IN THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND FROM NESTING IN THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE IT GROWS WE ARE THE SELF THAT GROWS FROM WITHIN THAT NEST AND THAT TELLS US A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE I AM SOMETHING NOW RIGHT NOW  THINGS I'VE DONE THE THINGS I'VE THOUGHT THE THINGS THAT AVE HAPPENED TO ME LIKE THERE'S A SELF NOW SO SO ONE MIGHT THINK THEN WHAT GROWS OUT OF THE NEST  IS WHAT I AM NOW HENCE THE CONCET OF ACCEPTANCE OF SELF THAT'S WHAT I AM NOW IBUT I AM ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR TENDING WHAT IS GROWING I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WEEDING IT ID I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANTING HEALTHY SEEDS IN IT AND I THINK THAT CAPTURES THE TRUTH OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF OURSELVES THIS IS WHAT I AM NOW THIS IS WHO I AM NOW BUT ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL THAT I CONTEND AND NURTURATE AAND WE KNOW AS YOU'D COMMENTED WHAT HAPPENS IF YE DON'T TENDED THERE'S A LOT OF WEEDS THINGS AREN'T GOING WELL THINGS ARE TO GET UNSTABLE OF IT THAT'S NOT GOOD AND WE CAN GO THAT WAY TOO  THAT'S WHERE AGENCY GRATITUDE YOUR PART OF HOW IT ALL SYCLES THROUGH RIGHT BECAUSE OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS STILL WORKING A GITS ALL STILL HAPPENING AND THAT'S HOW WE TEND THAT GARDEN OF THE SELF SO TO SPEAK THAT'S HOW WE BEST TENDID SO THAT WHAT GROWS UP FROM IT IS ASELF THAT WE RECOGNIZE IN THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE OURSELVES WE SEE ASELF THAT WE CAN FEEL PROUD OF WE SEE A SELF THAT WE UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH TO GUIDE FORWARD WE SEE ASELF FOR WHICH WE HAVE ENOUGH RESPECT AND HUMILITY WITHIN US TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING AND IT'S FROM THAT SELF THAT WE ENGAGE WITH THE WORLD I'VE HEARD MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THE CIRCLES OF PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF HELP AND UM ELSEWHERE THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO ALL LEARN TO MOTHER AND FATHER OURSELVES TO SOME EXTENT AND I'M NOT A DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND THE CONSCIOUS MIND OUR DEFENSE MECHANISMS THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE ALL THE STUP THAT MAKES UP THE NEST WHICH THE SELF RESIDES AND IF WE CAN GROW ARE LEAST AT SOME STAGE OF LIFE PERHAPS ALL STAGES OF LIFE DETERMINED BY GENATICS AND BY HOW WE WERE RAISED NATURE AND NURTURE BUT THIS PHRASE WE HAVE TO LEARN TO PARENT OURSELVES IT IS THROWN AROUND A LOT THESE DAYS CERTAINLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT ELSEWHERE TO AND A OFTENTIMES THAT BRINGS TO MIND A SORSTEREATYPES OF MOTHERING AND FATHERING AND THESE STEROTYPES BREAK DOWN QUITE A BIT THESE DAYS UM THE THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WE IFE TO BE NURTURING TO OURSELVES  SELF RESPECT SELF LOVE SELF PROTECTION RIGHT HEALTHY SELF PROTECTION IN THESE KINDS OF THINGS U AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS FINE AND GOOD BUT IT'S ALWAYS SEEMD A RATHER VAGUE TO ME I YOU KNOWGH I'M TELLING MYSELF A A MOQEY OR YOU KNOW IS THAT MOTHERING AND FATHERING MYSELF I I DON'T KNOW I MEAN UM IT DOESN'T SEEM AS CONCRETE AS AS PERHAPS I WOULD LIKE IN OTHERS WITH LIFE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE IT'S NOT SPELLING OUT TO SPECIFIC ACTIONABLES WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING HERE MAKES SO MUCH MORE SENSE TO ME EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THESE CONCEPTS ARE A BID ABSTRACT BECAUSE THE IDEA OF THIS NEST IN WHICH THE SELF RESIDES AND AND EMERGES FROM CHARACTER STRUCTURE UM ONE CAN IMMEDIATELY SEE WHY IT'S SO VALUABLE IN IT SUCH A KEY COMPONENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SELF CARE TO TEND TO THAT NEST AND WRITTEN INTO THAT IS THE FACT THAT THE NEST IS MALLEABLE THAT WE REALLY CAN MAKE CHANGES I THAT WE CAN CREATE A BETTER INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT FOR OURSELF BY GOING THROUGH THESE CUPVERTS YOU'RE POINTING OUT ANOTHER CRUCIAL FACTOR HERE WHICH IS IF I AM THE GARDEN OF SELF THAT GROWS UP FROM ALL OF IT AND I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR TENDING THE GARDEN I'M ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR TENDING TO THE WHOLE STRUCTURE AND THAT'S SO IMPORTANT IF I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF IN THE WAYS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT I'M GANTEND NOT JUST TO THE GARDEN THAT'S GROWING OUT THAT I CAN SEE ON THE SURFACE BUT I'M GOING TO ATTEND TO ALL OF ME TO THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF SELF AN EXAMPLE HERE THAT I THINK CAN ILLUSTRATE I PRETTY WELL IS SO IMAGINE A PERSON WHOSE DOING WELL YOUNW THAT THE PART OF THE ICEBERG UNDE THE WATER IS SOLID RIGHT THE CONSCIOUSNESS ON TOP IS SOLID HE DEFENCE MECHANISMS ARE CLEAR THE NEST IS GOOD THE GARDEN OF SELF IS FLOURISHING AND THEN THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DRAMA TO THAT PERSON IS A CAR ACCIDENT SOME ONE IS HURT THERE'S A DEATH OF SOME ONE AROUND THEM THEY HAVE A SERIOUS ILLNESS THEY LOSE A JOB RIGHT IT CAN EVEN BE THEY SPENT TOO MUCH TIME CONTEMPLATING AND LOOKING AT NEWS FROM MURDERS AROUND THE WORLD AND ALL THE AWFUL THINGS THAT WE CAN SPEND TOO MUCH TIME WITH SOMETHING TRAMATIC THEN GOES INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS MINE IGHT THE TRAMA HAPPENS AND WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS NOT ALWAYS BUT WHAT VERY OFTEN HAPPENS IS THE GUILT AND SHAME THAT A RAISE CAUSEUS TO PUSH THE TRAMA UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE NOW THAT'S IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND IT'S IMPACTING IT AND THAT STABILITY IS THREATENED I ADMINUTES ALL RIDING ON TOP OF THIS GIANT PART OF THE ICEBERG THAT'S UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND OOK IT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT RIGHT IF THINGS ARE GOING WELL BUT IF IT STARTS TO GET FRAGMENT ED IT STARTS TO SHIFT IT THREATENS EVERYTHING THAT RIDES ON TOP OF IT WHICH IS WIDE TAKING CARE OF OURSELFES MEANS TAKING CARE OF ALL ELEMENTS OF THE STRUCTURE OF SELF THAT ALL MAKES VERY CLEAR WHY TENDING TO TH GARDEN IS SO KEY AND WHY WE AS INDIVIDUALS ARE REALLY THE PEOPLE MOST FIT TO DO THIS I OF COURSE WHEN ONE CAN THAT WORK SHOULD BE DONE WITH SOMEBODY WHOSE REALLY TERRIFIC CLINITION I'LL GUIDE THAT PROCESS AND WHERE ONE CAN'T WORK WORTH THE CLINITION ONE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD TAKE A STRUCTURED APPROACH TO THIS WHICH IS REALLY UM WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND IN THE OTHER EPISODES AND KEEPING IN MIND  KEEPING IN MIND THAT TENDING TO THE SELF MEANS TENDING TO THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF SELF IGHT IF WE KEEP THAT IN MIND WE WON'T GO WRONG T WILL PAY ATTENTION TO THE SURFACE BUT WILL PAY ATTENTIEN TO E THINGS THAT ARE UNDER THE SURFACE WE PAY ATTENTION TO THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF SELF WE WILL SHEPHERD OURSELVES FORWARD AS BEST WE CAN I LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF SELF THE SECOND PILLAR THAT RESIDES ALONGSIDE STRUCTRE OF SELF AND THAT SERVES TO GUISER UP INTO HOW WE SHOW UP IN THE WORLD HOPEFULLY WITH EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENCY AND GRATITUDE BUT SOMETIMES KNOW AND AS WE'VE ESTABLISHE A THERE IS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS TREMENDOUS VALUE TO EXPLORING THESE CUPBOARDS SO HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT EXPLORING THE DIFFERENT CUPBOARDS UNDER THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND WE SPROLLEY START THAT CONVERSATION BY AMSAND WHAT ARE THE CUPBOARDS UNDER THE FUNCTION OF SELF I'LL START OFF BY SAYING ALL THE CUPBOARDS UNDER THE FUNCTION OF SELF WILL REFERENCE THE STRUCTURE OF SELF  WHICH MAKES SENSE THERE'S A STRUCTURE AND THE FUNCTION ARISES FROM THE FROM THE STRUCTORE IT'S GOOD FOR US TO HAVE THAT IN MIND AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF THE FUNCTION OF SELF SO THE DEEPEST ELEMENT IS SAY THET THE THE BOTTOM OF TH PILLAR IT IS SELF AWARENESS  THE SENSE OF AND I ON TOP OF THAT NEXT UP THE PILLAR OUR DEFENSE MECHANISMS INACTION IUP FROM THAT IS SAILIENTS WHAT WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO O INSIDE AND OUT THE NEXT LEVEL ABOVE THAT IS BEHAVIOR AND ON TOP OF THAT IS OUR STRIVINGS SO IF WE GO BACK TO THE THE BOTTOM LAYER THE DEEPEST MOST COMPLICATED LAYER IT'S THE SENSE OF SELF AWARENESS THE SENSE OF AND EYE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE CAN FOSTERSELF AWARENESS SO LIKE THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IN THE STRUCTURE WE CAN'T JUST GO THERE AND FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EYE IS BUT WE CAN DO THINGS THAT CAN REALLY REALLY HELP US OR FOR ME THINKING ABOUT LIK WHAT AM I AND HOW MY NAVIGATING THE WORLD AND HAVING IN MIND THE STRUCTURE OF SELF LIKE RAY THERE'S AN UNCONSCIOUS MIND WORKING IT AWAY IN ME THERES MY CONSCIOUS MIND EVEN BEING AWARE OF THE FIRST PILLAR CAN BE PART OF FOSTERING THE SELF AWARENESS OF THE SECOND PILLAR ANOTHER WAY THAT CAN HAPPEN IS SELF REFLECTION FOR SOME PEOPLE CAN HAPPEN IN MEDITATION CONTEMPLATION OF THE SELF THERE MANY WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP OURSELVES UNDERSTAND THAT LIVING IS AN ACTIVE PROCESS THAT IDEA OF THE LUGE OF TIME AND WERE IN WHAT WE'RE MOVING DOWN IT IT'S AN ACTIVE PROCESS AND THAT IS THE EYE THAT I'M GUIDING THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE CAN FOSTERSELF AWARENESS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE THE SAME AS WITH THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRUCTURE OF SELF PILLAR THE MOST COMPLICATED PARTS THERE'S A LOT THT'S UNCONSCIOUS IS A LOT THAT'S UNKNOWN TO US SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS NO SUM OF IT RIGHT AND NO MORE OF IT OVER TIND BRING SOME OF THOSE AUTOMATIC OR UNCONSCIOUS THINGS TO CONSCIOUS AWARENESS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE IF WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WE CAN UTILIZE THAT TO MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER I CAN SEE RIGHT OFF HOW THIS FIRST COBOARD OF SELF AWARENESS AND AN EXPLORATION OF THE EYE IS SO CRITICAL AND REALIZING THAT WE HAVE A PHYSICAL BOD HE THAT WE HAVE AGENCY IN THE WORLD TO DO LEAST CERTAIN THINGS IM AND IN AN EARLIER EPISODE YOU MENTIONED  A PRACTISE ACTUALLY OF OF LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AND FOCUSSING ON THIS REALITY THAT WE HAVE A PHYSICAL BODY WE RESIDE IN IT THAN WE HAVE AGENCY WE CAN DO THINGS IN THE WORLD AS A WAY TO REENFORCE SELF AWARENESS I'M SUCH AN INTERESTING PRACTICE AND ONE THAT I STARTED ON IMMEDIATELY AFTER WELL THAT EVENING YE AND THE NEXT MORNING IAFTER HEARING IT FROM YOUS SOME INTERESTING THINGS CAME TO MIND AND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TRY AT ITS IT'S A DONE ESOPEND FOR JUST FOR A FEW MINUTES OR SO TO THREE MINUTES IN MY CASE IM SOME INTERESTING A UNDERSTANDING CAME ABOUT ESPECIALLY WHEN COUPLED WITH THINKING ABOUT NOW SOME OF MY LIFE NARRATIVE IN THINGS THAT OFE HAPPENS AR HIGHLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE EXPLORE THIS AT THIS PRACTICE YOU DESCRIBED IM ALT SO INTERESTED IN THE SORTS OF NARRATIVES THAT WE HAVE ABOUT OURSELVES IM I THINK EVERYONE HAS NARRATIVES AABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOOD AT WHAT THEY'RE LESS GOOD AT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM WHY IT'S HAPPEN TO THEM UM COULD YOU TELL US WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT EXPLORING OUR NARRATIVES RIGHT NOT JUST EXPLORING FACTHAT WE HAVE A PHYSICAL BODY BUT EXPLORING OR ARE STORIES ABOUT OURSELVES WELL SELF AWARENESS IT IS JUST THE AWARENESS OF AN EYE RIHT SO WE CAN USE OUR CONSCIOUS MIND TO HELP THAT ISO THIS THIS ASPECT OF FUNCTION OF SELF ISN'T ABOUT WHAT THE NARRATIVE MEANS RIGHT THAT COMES LATER THIS IS ABOUT THE AWARENESS OF AND I SO WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE NARRATIVE YOU SAID SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES LIKE THEIR STORIES AND AND YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF LIKE OTTHATS IT'S THE SAME ME AN IN THESE STORIES IF IF YOU APPROACHD THE NARRATIVE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THE AWARENESS LIKE THERE'S AN EYE RIGHT THERE'S A ME LIKE IM THE POINT OF ALL THESE STORIES RIGHT THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE THEY'RE ALL IN ME IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE I RE EMBER THEM AND THEY'RE IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT I WROTE THEM DOWN IF YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY WERE JUST APPREHENDING AND I LIKE HUM THERE IS A ME TO WHOM ALL THIS APPLIES THAT'S HOW WE CAN USE THA CONSCIOUS MIND N THE NARRATIVE IN ORDER TO FOSTERSELF AWARENESS IT'S NOT YET ABOUT MEANING IT'S ABOUT THE AWARENESS OF AN EYE SO I'S ACTUALLY MUCH SIMPLER THAN I' MAKING IT OUT TO BE AT SOME LEVEL AT THAT LEVEL YES GOT IT YES WELL THEN AT SOME POINT WEE RETURN TO THE A THEEM OF NARRATIVES NARRATIVES THAT SERVUS PERAPS NARRATIVES DON'T SERVE US A MEANWHILE TAKE US INTO THAT SECOND BEEN UNDER THE FUNCTION OF SELF THAT THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN ACTION I FIND THESE INFINITELY FASCINATING AND I THINK MANY OTHER PEOPLE DO TOO BECAUSE IM SUBLEMATION N A DENY ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS I YOUR THEY REALLY PROVIDE SO MUC MUCH OF WHAT DOESN'T DOESN'T HAPPEN TO EACHT US AND IM YAVE SO IF YOU IF YOU COULD TELL US HOW WE CAN THINK ABOUT OUR DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND ACTION IN A WAY THAT CAN IMPROVE OUR HEALTH YE YE OF COURSE DEFENSE MECHANISMS ARE UNDER THE STRUCTURE OF MIND DEFENSE MECHANISMS INACTION AR UNDER FUNCTION OF MIND IT THEYRE UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSES THAT WE CAN GAIN SOMETIMES A VERY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF BY DIRECTING OUR CONSCIOUS MIND TOWARDS THEM AND THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN USE NARRATIVES RAT WE CAN USE AN UNDERSTANDING OFSELVES SO AS AN EXAMPLE SOME ONE WHO'S THINKING ABOUT THEMSELVES AND AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO FOR A LIVING IF THEY WANT THEYR JOB OR WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE AND YOU KNOW WHO'S THINKING ABOUT SELF CAN REALIZE YOU KNOW YOU SCAN TO FEEL GOOD WHEN I'M DOING SOMETHING FOR SOME ONE WHEN WE HEAR THIS A LOT ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO THEN DIRECT THEMSELVES TOWARDS HELPING PROFESSIONS LIKE WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THAT JOB IT WASN'T THAT I HAD A GREAT SALARY IT WASN'T THAT THE HOURS WERE GOIN NOW I LIKE THAT WHO IS REALLY HELPFUL TO PEOPLE OR OR YOU KNOW THEY WERE EOPLE THAT WERE UNDERNEATH OF ME IN THE HIERARCHY THAT I COULD REALLY CUD NURTURE RIGHT AND I THINK RIGHT AND I LOVE PUTTING FOOD OUT FOR THE BIRDS AND THE SQUIRRELS LIKE S  THAT IT CAN BE A REALIZATION OF SELF THAT GUIDES US TOWARDS CONSCIOUSLY APPREHENDING AND THINKING ABOUT OUTRUISM IS A DEFENSE MECHANISM BECAUSE OUTRUISM IS A DEFENSE IT'S A HEALTHY DEFENSE WHERE IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING GOOD YOU DO SOMETHING GOOD MAKE SOMETHING GOOD THAT'S THE END POINT IVILIC YOU DON'T NEED THAT TO TRANSLATE INTO SOMETHING ELSE IT'S A DEFENCE MECHANISM IT'S A GOOD ONE AND YOU CAN CERTAINLY SEE HOW IT FITS WITH THE GOOD THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD ON TOP OF IT AND SOMETIMES THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF REFLECTION THE PERSON BECOMES AWARE OF THAT THEY HAVEN'T CHOSEN JOBS BY THE OBVIOUS THINGS THAT EVEN THEY THOUGHT THEY CHOSE JOBS BY WHEREIS THE JOB WHAT DOES IT PAY IT WASN'T THAT THAT WHAT THEY REALLY VALUED AND WHAT THEY THEN STARTED CHOOSING UPON MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT THEY WEREN'T AWARE OF UNTIL THEY THINK ABOUT IT AND THAT LEADS THEM TO THE DEFENSE MECHANISM THE SAME WAY ANOTHER EXAMPLE COULD BE RATIONALIZATION I SOMEONE WHO THINKS ABOUT THEIR LIFE AND THEY THINK YOU KNOW WHOSE CAND I TELL MYSELF SOMETHING IS BETTER THEN IT IS RIGHT AN THEN ULTIMATELY I GOT DISAPPOINTING MYSELF YOU KLIK I TELL MYSELF LIKE YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL AT WORK AND AND I'M NOT REALLY WORKING HARD ENOUGH AND THEN WHEN I HAVE THAT REVIEW I FEEL LOUSY YOU KNOW AND THAT LAST PERSON WHO BROKE UP WITH ME AND SAYD N I JUST WEREN'T BEING A RELIABLE PARTNER OR YOU KNOW THAT PERSON WAS RIGHT I AND THAT COLNG TO OW IC WHAT'S GOING ON I ALWAYS THINK THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY WELL WHEN THEY'RE NOD HAS GUIDING US TOWARDS RATIONALIZATION IS A DEFENSE MECHANISM AND AGAIN A PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO SAY A I CONCLUDE I AMUSING RATIONALIZATION IS A DEFENSE MECHANISM BUT THERE CAN BE WORDS PUT TO THAT OF SEEING A PATTERN IN THESELF WITH IS WHEN THIS IS DONE AS PART OF THEIR APEUTIC INQUIRY WERE OFTEN LOOKING TO IDENTIFY THE DEFENS MECHANISMS AND THAT CAN BE GREAT TOO BUT IT'S NOT ALW AYS NEEDED RIGHT DEFENCE MECHANISMS RESULTING PATTERNST RIGS WOF A PERSON JUST SEES THE PATTERN THAT CAN BE ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE THE PATTERN AND EITHER SAY FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF ALTRUISM AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM OR HOW DO WE WORK AGAINST HOW TO I WORK AGAINST THE PATTERN OF RATIONALIZATION IS A DEFENSE MECHANIS CAN WE CONCLUDE THAT PATTERNS THAT WE DON'T LIKE AR THE REFLECTION OF UNHEALTHY DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND THAT PATTERNS THAT WE LIKE AR THE CONSEQUENCE OF HEALTHY DEFENSE MECHANISM USUALLY YES MISS WORS SOME THOUGHT IN SOME REFLECTION IN PUTTING TOGETHER LIKE WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE THE PIECES OF THAT BUT FASECALLY THE ANSWERE TO THAT AS Y AS IN AN EARLIER EPISODE YOU MENTION ONE DEFENSE MECHANISM IN ACTION THAT IS OFTEN OBSERVED IN PEOPLE IS ACTING OUT OF THIS A IMMEDIATELY SOUNDS LIKEAND UNHEALTHY DEFENSE MECHANISM A SO TO KEEP WITH THIS CONCEPT OF THE PATTERNS ARE OFTEN MORE OBSERVABLE THAN ARE THE UNDERLYING DEFENSE MECHANISMS WOULD IT BE THE CASE FOR INSTANCE THAT A IF SOMEBODY I YOU KNOW HAS A REPEATED SET OF FAILURES LIKE THAT'S THAT'S A PATTERN OR IS U REPEATEDLY INFRICTION IN A PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP IN THEIR LIFE WT MAYBE EVEN JUST WITH ONE PERSON LIKE ALL OTHER RELATIONSHIPS ARE GOING GREAT BUT THAT THERE A LOT OF FRICTION WITH THIS ONE OTHER PERSON SO THERE 'S A PATTERN FROM THAT PATTERN THEY COULD EXPLORE A WHAT I MEAN IS IT IMPORTANT THAT THEY GET TO A A VERBAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE DEFENSE MECHANISM OR AM YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT SORTS OF STEPS WOULD ONE TAKE GOING FROM A RECOGNITION OF THE PATTERN TO UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFENCE MECHANISM PERHAPS IN A WAY THAT MOVES THEM FORWARD THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFENCE MECHANISM CAN BE VERY HELPFUL BUT ISN'T ALWAYS NEEDED RIGHT IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE A MALEDAPTEVE PATTERN LIKE O THIS IS HAPPENING A LOT AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME YOU KNOW YOU YOU BECOME ABLE TO CHANGE THAT PATTERN RIGHT SO UNDERSTANDING THE DEFENSE CAN BE HELPFUL I MAY AGAINNO THE MORE UNDERSTANDING THE BETTER BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY HERE I THINK TO UNDERSTAND THAT THETHE DEFENSE MECHANISM WE SHOULD FIRSO DEFINE ACTING OUT BECAUSE WE THINK OF ACTING OUT JUST HEARING THE WORDS AS SOMETHING THAT'S VOLITIONWILL BE DONE RIGHT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT DEFENCE MECHANISMS ARE UNCONSCIOUS SO THERE'S AN AUTOMATICITY TO THE RESPONSE THAT THE PERSON CAN SEE BY REFLECTION BECAUSE THIS ISN'T CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO ACT OUT THAT' SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT'S BAD BEHAVIOR RIGHT BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE THING THAT'S AUTOMATIC AND UNCONSCIOUS IN TILL WE BRING IT INTO OUR CONSCIOUS MIND AND ACTING OUT ISN'T ALWAYS DRAMATIC EITHER SO SO HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE IGHT SO LET'S SAY IN A RELATIONSHIP SITUATION IGHT YOU HAVE ONE PERSON WHO ALWAYS DOES THE DISHES OTHE PERSON DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT RY THE PERSON DOES TE DISHES IGT AND IR IS ONEROUS PEOPLE O BUSY LIVE IS ON RSEP TO DU OT OF DISHES AND AND EVERY TIME LIKE THINGS AREN'T GOING SO WELL THERE'S A LITLE BIT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM RIT THE OTHER PERSON MAKES TWICE AS MANY DIRTY DISHES RIGHT THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS IN RELATIONSHIP SITUATIONS WHERE THIS LITTLE THING BECOMES A LITTLE CRACK IN THE DOOR THAT OPENS MORE THAN IS THE FOOT IN THE DOOR NOW THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE WE ACT OUT IN THESE WAYS THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF SO CAND THE PERSON ISN'T DECIDING I'M GOING TO DO THAT SO THAT THAT THAT PERSON HAS TO DO MORE WORK BUT THERE'S AN AUTOMATICITY TO IT AND AND UPON REFLECTION SOMETIMES A PERSON COULD REALIZE I'M DOING THAT RIGHT OR IS A REAL EXAMPLE PERSON WHO REALIZES I JUST MAKE MUCH MORE DIFFICULTIES IT AROUND THE HOUSE WHICH I MAKE A LOT MORE DIFFICULTIES FOR MY PARTNAMS OF WOE IU KNO LIKE THIS PERSON DOESN'T WANT TO BE DOING THAT RIGTHER THAT'S NOT THEY LOVE THAT PERSON THEY DON'T WANT TO BE DOING THAT BUT BY REALIZING THAT WHEN THEY CAN BRING A PROCESS OF CHANGE WHOM JUST BEING MORE SELF AWARENS AY LOOKI DON'T WANT TO DO THAT I DON'T WANT TE TO BE A DEFENCE ANY MORE IF I HAVE CONSCIOUS AWARENESS NOW I CAN CONTROL IT AND MAYBE THAT PERSON IS DOING THAT OTHER PLACES MANYPERS AS YOU KNOW AND IT GOES THAT WAY AT WORK TOO YOU KNOW I CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A PROJECT AND MAKE SOMETHING EASIER ON A PERSON AND I REALIZE I DON'T DO THAT RIGHT IF I'M IF I'M FEELING IT SOME NEGATIVE WAY THAN WE CAN GO FINE O AT WHAT MIGHT THE ROUTS OF THAT BE DID FOR EXAMPLE DID APPARENT ROMADE THAT BEHAVIOR RIGHT WAS THAT DONE TO THEM WHERE THE PARENT WAS REALLY GOOD TO THEM IF THEY WERE BEHAVING IN THE RIGHT WAY AND LIKE THEY MAKE THE BREAKFAST RIGHT AND IF NOT WELL YOU KNOW YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF OR OH SORRY THERE'S NO MILK LIKE THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND THEN THE PERSON GETS IN THEM SOME ARRAY OF CIRCUMSTANCES FEELINGS RESPONSE AS ALL THE SUFF THAT GOES ON IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND THAT THEN THROWS UP TO THE SURFACE THIS KIND OF ACTING OUT AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM SO I THINK IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT INTO GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT IS UNCONSCIOUS AND A LOT OF TIMES HOW WE'RE DOING IT IS NOT DRAMMATIC WHAT ABOUT SALIENTS NOW THIS CUPBOARD UNDER THE FUNCTION OF SELF THAT I THINK WE ARE ALL ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH NOT YOUNGLY WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY IM I HAVE A SORT OF BIZAARE MEDITATIVE PRACTICE THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THE PODCAST I DO'T KNOW H I CAME UP WITH US BUT IT'S MORE OF A PERCEPTIONAL EXERCISE THAT I DO FROM TIME TO TIME WHERE IF I FEEL LIKE I'M TOO IN MY HEAD I LITERALLY FOLKIS MY VISUAL ATTENTION OUTWARD I TRY IN PLACE ON A HORIZON OR SOME OBJECT OUT THERE I'M AND OTHER TIMES IF I'M IN THE WORLD TOO MUCHION I WANTO GET BACK IN MYSELF ELL  CLOSE MY EYES AN DO A MOMENT OR TOO OR MORE OF MORE TRADITIONAL WHAT TRA DITIOWALL MEAN WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF THIS MEDITATION THE THE PRACTICE INVOLVES SETTING ASIDE A MINUTE OR TWO AND DELIBERATELY STEPPING THROUGH A CLOSED I MEDITATION LIKE JUST IT'S NOT REARLY MEDITATION AGAIN ATS IT'S JUST RECON I MYSELF LIKE HERE CONTAINED WITHIN MY THE SKIN OF MY BODY THEN I OPEN MY EYES I LOOK A MY HAND THIS ALL SOUNDS VERY SILLY AS I DESCRIBE IS WEN BUT IT AND THEN I THINK ABOUT A BRIDGE LIKE MY PERCEPTION CAN BE SPLIT BETWEEN MY AWARENESS OF SELF INTERNALLY AND MY HAND THEN I LOOK OUT SOME DISTANCE TEN TWELVE FEET OR SO IM AND DO THE SAME I SURBRIDGE TO SELF AWERE BRIDGESELF AWARENESS WITH EXTERNAL AWARENESS I STEP OUT TO THE HORIZON AND THEN I SOMETIMES LIKE TO DO THE EXERCISE OF AM IT GOES WITH A POPULAR MEAN TE ANOTHERS TAT WERE JUST LIKE THIS LIKE PALE BLUE DOT I THINK ABOUT MYSELF IN AND RIGHT HERE BUT THEN THE FACT THAT APLANET THAT'S LIKE SPINNING IN A KNOWIN IN SPACE AND AND THEN RIGHT BACK INTO MYSELF AND THEN I GO ABOUT MY DAY IM I AND I DEVELOPED THAT A FEW YEARS AGO MORE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT I KNOW ABOUT VISUAL PERCEPTION AND INTERRECEPTION I RECOGNITION OF INSIDE BURSE'S EXTRA RECEPTION JUST FANCY LANGUAGE FOR RECOGNITION AND PERCEPTION OF ITS OUTSIDE BUT I' THAT'S MY PRACTICE OF OF ORIENTING MYSELF IN LIFE IM BECAUSE THEN I FEE LIK OI HAVE A BETTER BUFFERS AGAINST WHAT HAPPENS AROUND ME AND HOW MUCH I'M REACTING OR NOT REACTING THAT'S MY PRACTICE AM I I OV A FEELING IT IT TOUCHES INTO A FEW OF THESE BENS IM BUT NOT BUT IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T GET IT IT AT A YOU KNOW APPROACHING A SPECIFIC PROBLEM OR I'M THINKING ABOUT WARE PROBLEMS MIGHT EXIST BENEATH THE SURFACE THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF I IT I'S ONLY ONE PART OF THE OQUATION I SAYITS PAYING ATTENTION TO SAILIN SEE WHAT YOUARE DOING THEN YOU'RE GROUNDING YOURSELF IN ORDER TO CHANGE SALIENTS I AND AND THAT IS A STRATEGY YOU SAID I MIV IT'S SILLY OUR THIS AN AT NOSE AND IS AN UNDERSTOOD AND KNOWN STRATEGY FOR EXAMPLE F VARIATIONS OF THAT ARE ARE WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO PREVENT PANICATACS RIGHT TO CHANGE THE SALINTS IF THE SALINTS IS I'M GOING INSIDE OF ME AND I'M FEELING PANIC DAND I JUST YOU KNOWIUS OF A FEELING OF AWFULNESS TAT YOU CAN CHANGE THAT SALIENTS BY GROUNDING YOURSELF TO THE WORLD AROUND YOU RIGHT WE TELL PEOPLE PLACE YOU TO PLACS YOUR HANDS ON THE TABLE LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS OF EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS LOOK AT THE SHAPE OF ADOOR KNOB RIGHT GROUND YOURSELF SO THAT YOU CAN CHANGE SALIENTS BECAUSE NOW AS WE MOVE UP THE HIERARCHY OF OF FUNCTION OF SELF WE'RE GETTING TO USING THE CONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT THINGS THAT ARE SALIENT TO US CAN BE EXTERNAL THEY CAN BE INTERNAL AND IF THEIR INTERNAL THEY CAN BE CONSCIOUS AND SOMETIMES A'RE UNCONSCIOACE SO IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE CONSCIOUS MIND BUT WE'RE BRINGING THE CONSCIOUS MIND TO BEAR HERE TO THINK ABOUT SALIENTS WHICH COMBINE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE CAN HELP US SEE WHAT'S UNDER THE SURFACE MOST OF THE TIME WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT ACT OF SELF OBSERVATION RIGHT WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE OF ME WHICH CAN BE WHAT AM I THINKING THIS IS HOW THE PERSON CAN REALIZE OVER AND OVER OH MY GOODNESS I'M SAYING TO MYSELF ACTS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY SAY OUT LOUD AND REALIZE THE THING THEY'VE SAID TO THEMSELFS TEN THOUSAND TIMES RIGHT OR IT CAN BE A FEELING STATE RIGHT WELL WHAT SALIENT TO ME IS A FEELING STATE SAY OF VONERABILITY AND THEN EVERYTHING SEEMS THREATENING RIGHT SO SALIENTS IT'S IT'S A FORM OF SELF AWARENESS THAT WE CAN COULD SAY AS USING THE CONSCIOUS MIND NOW TO TEND TO THAT GARDEN OF SELF RIGHT TO LOOK AT THAT GARDEN OF SELF AND SAY WHAT'S REALLY GROWING FROM IT RIGHT IS IS ALL THINGS I LIKE RIGHT AS TO BE NEVER ALL THINGS WE LIKE AS IT'S A PROCESS BUT AM I HAPPY WITH IT AM I NOT HAPPY WITH IT ARE THERE YOU KNOW WEEDS THAT ARE COMING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE THOSE THAT CAN BE THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS RIGHT SO WE'RE USING METAPHORS BUT IT THAT YE VERY VERY CONCRETE RIGHT TO SALIENTS PARD IS WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE OF ME AND THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING INQUIRY AND INFORM ME TO RIGHT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S A NFORMATIVE DO YOU THINK THAT'S IN INQUIRY THAT'S BEST DONE IN MEDITATIVE LIKE STATES YOU KNOW SET WOR SETTING ASIDE SOME DELIBERATE TIME TO UM TO THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT AM I THINKING ABOUT WHAT AM I PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW AM I ALLICATING MY THOUGHTS FOR MY THOUGHTS BEING ALICATED I GUESS WE HAVE TO RESPECT THE A UNCONSCIOUS COMPONENT HERE LIKE WE'RE NOT EWE DON'T WALKER OUTS H ONPLACE MY ATTENTIONAL SPOT LIKE THERE THAN MY THINKING HERE YOU KNOW I WE WE ALWAYS WANT TO BE AWARE OF WHAT WE THAT THEY'RE THINGS WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S RESPECTFUL THAT'S APPROPRIATE HUMILITY BECAUSE IT'S TRUE SO I'M ASSUMING THIS RATCHETS DIRECTLY INTO THE CUPBOARD OF BEHAVIOR I UM YET WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING UM IS THAT CUPBOARD BEST EXPLORED BY LISTING OFF PERHAPS ON PAPER IN OUR MINDS WHAT WE'RE DOING EACH DAY IS THAT IS AT ONE WAY TO EXPLORE LIKE HOW AM I SPENDING MY TIME UM AGAIN NOT AS A ANEFFICIENCY EXERCISE BUT AS A WAY TO START TO EXPLORER THESELF AND AND UM AND THE MIND A FORSAKE OF BUILDING UP TO MORE AGENCY IN GRATITUDE I  THE ROUTES TO TO MOST EFFECTIVE SELF INQUIRY RIGHT TO BRINGING THE CONSCIOUS MIND TO BEAR REALLY DIFFER WIDELY BY PERSON THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO THEYARE SO WELL SERVED BY DOING THAT WHEN THEY'RE MEDITATING I THER'RE OTHER PEOPLE WHO THEY CAN REALLY GET AT THAT WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING A SPORT IN NUS GOING ON INSIDE OF THEM ALONG WITH THE OTHER THINGS TNOW THET THE'RE THAT THEY'RE DOING SOME PIPE PEOPLE FIND IT IN THE SHOWER OR THEY FIND WHEN THEY WAKE UP IN THE MORNING OR THEY FIND IT WHEN THEY'RE WITH AN ANIMAL THEY LOVE WHERE THEY MIGHT FIND IT WHEN THEY'RE READING A CERTAIN KIND OF MATERIAL AND THEN THEY READ IT AND THEN THEY KIND AF THE READING TRAILS OFF AND THEY'R THINKING THEIR REVERIES  INSIDE SO HOW WE CAN ENGENDER THE BEST USE OF OUR CONSCIOUS MINDS IS GOTTNTO DIFFER BY PERSON BUT IDN WE CAN THINK ABOUT THAT LIKE WHAT REALLY WORKS FOR ME LET ME DO MORE OF THAT SOMEWHONE NIT SINTHNG WE SEE PEOPL L SOMETIMES ISY PEOPLE A LOT OF THE TIME WHO ARE THEY'RE TRYING TO MEDITATE TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES AND LIKE NOT WORKING GRAY AND THINK I MUST KNOW HOW TO MEDITATE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF WAS NOT NECESSARILY TRUE IT MIGHT BE I MUST GO ON MORE HEIKES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND MYSELF BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WORKS FOR ME SO THAT PROCESS OF REFLECTION CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL TO US BECAUSE WE'RE USING OUR CONSCIOUS MIND TO TRY AND EITHER LOOK IN WORD WHAT IS SAILING IT TO ME INCLUDING UNDERSTANDING THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND A LOT OF IT AND OUTWARD WHAT BEHAVIOURS OF MY ENGAGING AND WHAT ARE MY BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS TO BE REFLECTIVE ABOUT THAT TO THINK ABOUT THAT CAN BE IMMENSELY HELPFUL TO US ICK HOW AM I SPENDING THOSE HOURS OF THE DAY WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY TIME MY WASTING MY TIME DO I ALWAYS GET MAD AND SAY SOMETHING MEAN TO SOMEBODY WHY BECAUSE I HAD A NEGATIVE THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING MY DOING THAT NO HAVE I GOT A CHANGED SINCE SOMETHING UNPLEASANT HAPPENED AND YOU KNOW NOW I'M NOT SO NICE TO SOME ONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD RIGHT OR AM I TAKING A LOT BETTER CARE OF MYSELF YOU KNOW  SINCE I STARTED DOING EXTS WHATEVER EXT MAY BE LEARNING MORE ABOUT MYSELF RGHT A DOING MORE THE THINGS I LIKE GOT LEFT THAT OLD JOB IT WAS SO HARD FOR ME TO LEAVE YOU KNOW I DO ACTUALLY GET MYSELF TO THE GEM RIGHT SO IT'S A REFLECTION UPON SELF BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT WE DO WE DO AUTOMATICALLY RIGHTAN THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT THE EXAMPLE THIT OFTEN IS GIVEN IS O CASE THINK ABOUT HOW YOU LAST BRUSHED YOUR TEETH RIGHT AND THE ANCS BY LIKE A BLANK RIGHT BECAUSE YOU BRUSH YOUR TEETH IN AN AUTOMATIC WAY RIGHT MOST OF US DON'T REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE WE JUST SKIP RIGHT OVER IT SO IT MAKES SENSE IT LETS US THINK WHILE WE'RE DOING THINGS IT LET'S A LOT HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD RIGHT JUST AS IT HAPPENS INSIDE OF US AUTOMATICALLY BUT WE CAN THERE HAV SOT O MUCH OF A GOOD THING WHERE TOO MUCH IS HAPPENING AUTOMATICALLY AND WE WANT TO STOP AND THINK AND IT'S REMARKABLE HOW SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE STOP AND THINK THEY MIGHT SAY WE REAL EXAMPLES I DON'T WANT TO BE SPENDING FIVE NIGHTS A WEEK AT THE BAR AND I'M SPENDING FIVE NIGHTS A WEEK AT THE BAR WY BECAUSE I GO HOME A CERTAIN WAF FROM WORK AND THERE'S A BAR ALONG THAT WAY AND THEN I THINK O I'LL JUST STOP IN AND MAYBE SEE A FRIEND AND THEN I KNOW THAT ONCE I GET IN THERE I'M GOINGTO HAVE A DRINK AND I KNOW ONCE I HAVE A DRINK ON GANG AGET THREE AND I AGNT HAVE THREE AND I SEE THIS PATTERN OF BEHAVIOURS AND HOW LIKE I DON'T DECIDE I'MGING TO GO TO THAT BAR INSTEAD OF GOING HOME TO SEE MY WIFE FOR MY HUSBAND AND MY KIDS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND I DON'T WANT TA BEHAVE THAT WAY RIGHT BECAUSE THERE THAT'S IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU CAN STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING BUT ONCE ITS STARTS HAPPENING THE DOMINO START FALLING IT'S VERY VERY HARD BHUT PEOPLE DON'T GENERALLY REALIZE OLY GOODNESS EM IN THE BARN I'VE AD ONE DRINK AND OLL GAN HAVE TWO MORE THAT'S NOT THE TIME BUT THE UNDERSTANDING THE REFLECTION UPON BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS CAN LEAD A PERSON TO STOP THOSE BEHAVIOURS TO UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THEM GET THEIR ARMS AROUND THEM SHINE THE LIGHT OF DAY ON THEM AND THEN HAVE GREATER AGENCY RIGHT GREATER GRATITUDE I'M I'M GRATEFUL I CAN GO HOME TO MY FAMILY AND THAT'S WHAT I CHOOSE TO DO RIGHT AND I CAN DO THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO END UP AT THAT BARN I'M NOCK AN END AT TAT THAT BAR I'M GOING TO DRIVE A DIFFERENT WAY HOME AND IF I CAN'T GET MYSELF TO DO THAT AND WEN AVE A FRIEND IN THE CAR WITH ME AND IF I CAN'T DO THAT I'LL BE IN THE BACK SEAT RIGHT BUT I'M NOT DOING THAT THING I CHOOSE NOT TO DO AND NOW THAT'S IT'S A MORE DRAMATIC EXAMPLE NOT AN UNCOMMON ONE BUT WE CAN APPLY THAT THE WHOLE WAY UP THE LIST FROM NEUANCSAS OF OUR BEHAVIOUR IS DOWN TO MORE DRAMATIC BEHAVIORS I'VE HEARD YOU DESCRIBE THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND SOME OF ITS OTHER INTERCONNECTED WORKINGS WITH A THE ANA LOGY OF A U NOW PHANTOM IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND WE'RE IN THE BACK SEAT SORT OF OF COURSE ALL WITHIN ONE PERSON WRITE THIS IDEA THAT WHICH IS BEING TAKEN PLACES THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GO OR THAT WE KNOW WE SHOULDN'T GO OR THAT CAN'T REALLY FIGURE OUT WHY WE'RE GOING THERE WE HAVE SOME IDEA BUT AM WE'RE JUST NOT CERTAIN ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AM RELATED TO REALLY A DESTRUCTIVE ACTION EITHER I'MEAN IT CAN BE BUT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SOUNDS TO ME A LOT LIKE A CLIMBING OUT OF THE BACK SEAT AND AM MAY BE SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND LOOKING INTO THE A DRIVERS SEAT I OLI THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE COURSE ALL OF THIS IS ONE MIND A AND IN DOING THAT TAKING SOME CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS THAT PHANTOM WHERE DID IT COME FROM THAT'S HOW WE GET RID OF EXOC HOW DO WE GET BACK IN THE DRIVER SEA WE DON'T GRAB THE PHANTOM AND THROW IT OUT THE DOOR WICTHROW IT IN THE BACK SEAT RIGHT IT'S IT'S A PHEMBERAL WE CAN'T GRAB IT  SO HOW DOES IT GO AWAY IT GOES AWAY THROUGH UNDERSTANDING SO VERY COMMON EXAMPLE THAT THE PHANTOM IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT IS TRAMA THAT WE HAVE PUSHED IN AN UNCONSCIOUS PLACE AND NOW THAT WHOLE UNDER THE SURFACE STRUCTURE OF THE ICEBERG IS IS FRAGMENTED AND A SORT OF ROYALING AND THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM THERE AND IF WE GO AT THAT PROBLEM AND WHATEVER IT'S SPINNING OFF RA THAT'S THE ABSESS BUT IT'S A BAD ONE AND IT'S SPINNING OFF A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND THAT'S WHY THE PHANTOM IS IN THE DRIVER SEAT BECAUSE HEALTHY THINGS ARE NOT BUILT ON TOP OF THAT FRACTURING AND ROYALING PART OF THE ICEBERG RIGHT WE SEE THAT A LOT THE PHANTOM COULD ALSO BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT COULD BE ONE DEFENCE MECHANISM THAT'S UNHEALTHY THAT WE ARE REALLY OVER RELYING ON AND THEN WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT THROUGH THAT LAND SO THERE JUSET A FEW EXAMPLES BUT IF IF ENOUGH WE SOOD A WAKE UP IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR SO TO SPEAK AND THE PHANTOM IS DRIVING RECKLESSLY THAND HOW WE GET THE PHANTOM OUT OF THE FRONT SEAT IS BY UNDERSTANDING IT TAN YOU N ALWAYS IMAGINE PROVE IT GOES AWAY BECAUSE NOW'S NOT DRIVING MY LIFE ANY MORE RIGHT I'M DRIVING MY LIFE IT'S GONE THE MESSAGE THAT I'M HEERING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN MY HEAD IS THAT NO MATTER HOW WELL OR HOW POORLY ANY OF OUR LIVES HAPPEN TO BE GOING THAT BY LOOKING IN THESE CUPBOARDS UNDER STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF WE CAN HAVE SO MUCH MORE POSITIVE CONTROL YES YES THAT'S WHY ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS OPTIMISTIC WE CAN'T HELP OURSELVES IF WE DON'T HONOR TRUTH AND THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE ARE COMPLEX ASPECTS OF THIS SO O KE WE WE WANT TO GO LOOK AT THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT HOW THINGS CAN GO WRONG AND THAT'S ALL VERY VERY IMPORTANT BUT THAT'S ALL RAPPED IN THE BEST TRUTH WHICH IS THAT WE CAN CHANGE IT WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER THAT'S WHY THE SELF THE GARDEN OF SELF IS ON TOP OF THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND THE TOP OF THE FUNCTION OF SELF ARE OUR STRIVINGS THAT'S WHAT COMES NEXT AFTER BEHAVIORS AS IT WHAT ARE MY BEHAVIORS DOING WHAT AM I DOING WHAT AM I STRIVING TOWARDS WHAT AM I DOING LITERALLY AM I GOING TO A JOB I HATE AM I DOING THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO AM I ACCEPTING TREATMENT THAT I DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT AM I TREATING PEOPLE IN WAYS I DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT HOW CAN I STRIVE FOR BETTER AND STRIVING IN HOPEFULNESS OR SO INTERTWINED SO THE PINNACLE OF THE FUNCTION PILLAR IS STRIVING THE PINNACLE OF THE STRUCTURE PILLAR IS SELF AND WE CAN SEE HOW THE SELF THE STRIVINGS WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS COMBINING THE PILLARS WHERE IT COMES TOGETHER AND KNOW YOUR IMAGERYOF I THAT'S WHERE THE GUYSER COMES FROM AND WE WANT THAT GUYSER TO BE HEALTHY RIGHTS A STREAM OF CLEAR CLEAN WATER THAT'S COMING OUT OF IT THAT'S WHERE OUR EMPOWERMENT IS BUT EMPOWERMENT IS A CONDITION OF BEING RIGHT I AM EMPOWERED EMPOWERMENT REST WITHIN ME THAT'S WHERE HUMILITY COMES INTO THE PICTURE HUMILITY ALSO SOMETHING WITHIN ME RIGHT I HAVE HUMILITY THEY'RE NOT VERBS BUT EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY THEN GAIN THEIR EXPRESSION AT THE TOP OF THAT GUYSER WHEN AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THOSE VERBS ARISE FROM EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY WHAT YOU'VE DRAWN FOR US AS AN INCREDIBLY COMPELLING PICTURE BECAUSE THE THE PICTURE MAP IS REALLY A ROAD MAP IT'S IT'S A PATH TO IDEALS AND UM AND YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE IDEALS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE  ACROSS THE SERIES AND M THEY JUST ENCOMPASS SO MUCH AND AS YOU MENTION BEFORE THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED M AND THEY ARE VERB STATES AND A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE GUYSERING UP FROM THE PILLARS TOWARD AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ARE THESE TWO COMPONENTS OF EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY TELL US A LITWL BIT MORE ABOUT EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY AND HOW WE SHOULD VIEW EMPWERMENT AND HUMILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF SELF CARE O EMPOWERMENT IS A STATE THAT WE CAN CREATE FOR OURSELVES IF WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THE PILLARS RIGHT SO WE'RE LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS WE'RE DOING E THINGS THIT MAKE OUR MAP CLEARE AND CLEARER RIGHT THIS IDEA THAT OH THAT SEEM LIKE A GOOD PATH BUT IT GETS CLEARER AND THERE'S A SWAMP THEYRE RIGHT OR THAT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD PATH BECAUSE IT'S HIR CUITOUS OH KNOW BUT THEY'RE GOOD THINGS ALONG THAT PATH SO THE MAP GETS CLEARER AS WE TEND TO THE CUPBEARDS IN THE PILLARS AND THAT EMPOWERS US RIGHT WERE IN A STATE IS A STATE INSIDE OF US THAT IS A STATE OF POTENTIALS THAT ARE NOW SKEWED IN A GOOD WAY RIGHT THAT'S WHAT EMPOWERMENT IS IS LIHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IT'S A STATE THAT WE THEN BRING TO BEAR ON WHAT HAPPENS RIHT THE SAME IS TRUE OF HUMILITY NO HUMILITY DOES NOT MEAN NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THINGS THAT ARE GOOD ABOUT YOU RIGHT AND WE OFTEN CAN CAN VERY MUCH MISCHARACTERIZE HUMILITY LIKE AS THAT PERSON BEING WEAK IS IT FALSE HUMILITY OR PEOPLE OFTEN WHO ARE CONSCIENTIOUS DON'T WANT ACKNOWLEDGE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THEM OW NO NO NOT THAT SMART LIKE THAT'S NOT HUMILITY RIGHT HUMILITY IS CONSISTENT WITH TRUTH IGHT SO IF YOU KEEP SAYING YOU'RE NOT THAT SMART BUT THE WORLD AROUND YOU TELLS YOU THAT YOU'RE THAT SMART RIGHT THEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'RE THAT SMART RIGHT THAT'S COMING THROUGH THE LENDS OF TRUTH AND RIGHT WHEN GO DOWN TO THE PILLARS AND THE CUPBERS AND SO GOHAD AS A PERSON GET TO ACKNOWLEDGING THAT TRUTH RIGHT SO IT'S ONLY BI BUT BY SQUARING AWAY THE THINGS THAT HUMILITY ISN'T RIGHT IT IS NOT DENEGRATING OURSELVES AND AND WE SEE THAT IN A LOT OF PEOPLE I'M HUMBLE SO AND THEN THE PERSON OFTEN TELLS YOU WHY THEY'RE ACCEPTING SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOOD TO ACCEPT RIGHT SO HUMILITY IS ABOUT ACKNOWLEDGING TRUTHFULLY THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT YOU HAVE WITHIN YOURSELF GOOD AND BAD AND HERE IS WHERE WE CAN IDENTIFY THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT SO HAPPY WITH RIGHT WE HAVE TO HAVE HUMILITY WITHIN US IN ORDER TO MAKE OURSELVES BETTER RIGHT JUST LIKE I HAVE TO SAY LOOK I'D LIKE TO BE MORE FIT IF I'M GOING TO THEN GET MYSELF IN A MORE FIT STATE RIGHT SO SAYING I CAN BE NOW I CAN BE A LITTLE BIT SOSNIPPY WITH PEOPLE IF I'M IRRITATE OR I CAN BE A LITTLE BIT CONDESCENDING OR YOU KNOW I CAN AM I CAN BE LITTLE SELFISH AT TIMES BUT IS HEARD TO ADMIT THESE THINGS TO OURSELVES BUT IF WE HAVE THE HUMILITY TO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE THINGS RIGHT THEN WE ALSO GET TO HAVE THAT BROADER HUMILITY ABOUT JUST BEING A PERSON LIKE WHILE LOOK HOW COMPLICATED THIS IS TO NAVIGATE LIFE THET MEN THESE PILLARS ARE NOT SIMPLE AND WHEN WE GO DOWN TO THE THE REAL BASE ELEMENTS OF THEM IT CEN GET VERY COMPLICATED SO THEN WE HAVE A COMPASSION RIGHT FOR SELF AND FOR OTHERS NO LIE SOMETIMES A'LL SAY TO A PERSON I SHOULD BE DOING THIS I SHOULD BE DOIG THAT THEY THEY THINK THEY SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING PERFECTLY AND I WILL SAY TO THEM IT'S IT'S AMAZING THAT THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD RIGHT MEAN LET STAR WITH WITH WOW IT'S NOT EASY TO BE HUMAN IT'S NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE THIS WORLD AND THAT KIND OF HUMILITY CAND THEN ALLOW US TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT WE BUILD ON TOP OF IT RIGHT IT'S NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE THIS WORLD AND HUMANS ARE PRETTY VULNERABLE BY END LARGE BUT I'M APPLYING MYSELF RIGHT AND AND I'M PROUDTHED O'M APPLYING MYSELVES AND THAT I'M PERSEVERANT BUT ALSO I'D LIKE TO BE A LITTLE MORE COMPASSIONE IT'S THAT SORT OF THING THAT COMBINES WITH EMPOWERMENT SO EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY ARE THESE POTENTIAL STATES THAT THEN EXPRESS THEMSELVES OR BECOME ENACTED HOWEVER WE WISH TO PUT THAT BUT THEY CHANGE INTO THE ACTIVE VERBS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ARE WAYS OF BEING RIGHT THEIR VERBS THEIR ACTIVE SO THAT'S THE POINT OF IT FROM THE SENSE OF HOW WE ARE LIVING RIGHT HOW WE ARE BEING THAT'S WHY AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IS IN SOME SENSE ITS OWN AND POINT RIGHT BUT BECAUSE THERE'S A CIRCULAR ASPECT OF THIS RIGHT ARE ACTIVE BEING IS NOT THE END POINT IF WE'RE BEING IN A HEALTHY WAY THEN WE GET TO EXPERIENCE THINGS RIGHT PEACE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT WE EXPERIENCE THEM BECAUSE WE ARE HEALTHY SO WE GET TO BE THROUGH THE LENDS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE WE GET TO EXPERIENCE PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT AND THAT MAKES A HEALTHIER US THE DRIVES AND THEIR EXPRESSION ARE IN BETTER BALANCE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS FOSTERED AND STRENGTHENED AND THE DRIVES UNDERNEATH THE AGGRESSION ASSERTION PROACTIVE RIGHT WE'RE REALLY USING THAT IN A GOOD WAY AND WE'RE MINDING ALL OF IT WITHIN US LIKE I WANT TO BRING THAT TO BEAR AND I CAN BRING MORE OF IT TO BEAR RIGHT THAT'S VERY VERY GOOD AND THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS ACTIVE IN US I'M ENJOYING THE THINGS I DO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE THINGS I DO O MAKING GOOD CHOICES AND THAT STATE OF HEALTH WHAT IT PROMOTES THE PILLARS THE CUPBOARDS TO STAY CLEAN AND CLEAR AND HEALTHY RIGHT BUT LIFE IS LIFE AND THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF LIFE WILL CONTINUE TO COME AT US AND CAUSE US TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE PILLARS IN THE CUPBOARDS AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T COME AT US THOSE THINGS ARE NEVER PERFECT IHT BUT THAT'S NOT BAD BECAUSE BY TENDING TO THEM WHERE DO WE BRING OURSELVES WE BRING OURSELVES BACK TO THE ACTIVE VERBS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THE ACTIVE VERBS OF LIVING AND HERE WE ARE IN THIS CYCLE THAT IF WE PAY ATTENTION TO IT WE USE IT TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES WE USE IT TO IMPROVE OURSELVES CAN BRING US TO BETTER LIFES HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT A PERSON AND I'VE CONFESS I'VE BEEN THIS PERSON UM PERHAPS STILL AM TO SOME EXTENT WHO CAN EALLY HAVEN'T SENSE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IN CERTAIN DOMAINS MAYBE EVEN MANY DOMAINS OF LIFE UM AND YET FEELS AS IF THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF LIFE THAT ARE JUST SO MUCH MORE CHALLENGING THAN OTHERS I THIS LIKE START CONTRAST LIKE THIS STUFF WORKS CAN DO THAT BUT T THIS STUFF IS JUST REALLY REALLY HARD UM AND MAYBE THAT CONTINUES LONG ENOUGH THAT IT ALMOST STARTS TO FEEL LIKE OR THE PERSON WANDERS WHETHER NOT YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT PART OF LIFE IS INACCESSIBLE TO ME IT'S JUST NEVER GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR ME UM YOU HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE A CARVE OUTS OF OF IN A FUNCTIONALITY AND LACK OF FUNCTIONALITY THAT'S PLY NOT THE RIGHT LANGUAGE BUT UM I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I IT RELATES DIRECTLY I BELIEVE TO KIND OF NARRATIVES THAT WE TELL OURSELVES AND MAY THEY ARE NARRATIVES RIGHT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THING ABOUT THESE BECAUSE IM YOU KNOW THEY ARE INTERMASHED WITH AND PERHAPS EVEN THE CONSEQUENCE OF NARRATIVES THAT WE HAVE LIKE STORIES ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE HAVE INTERNALLY I AND IYETT YOU KNOW I I'LL YOU THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT II'VE FELT THIS WAY FOR MUCH OF MY LIFE UM CERTAIN THINGS I CAN DO OTHER THINGS FAR FAR HARDER AND SOMETIMES HAVE FELT OUTSIDE THE REACHER POSSIBILITY IHAVE A VERY CONCISE ANSWER TO THIS ONE IN FACT IT'S NOWING WORDS DON'T MAKE YOURSELF SPECIAL IN WAYS THAT HURT YOU AND WE TEND TO DO THAT AS HUMANS OH I GET TO HAVE ABIENCY BUT I DON'T GET TO HAVE THE I GET THAT PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS AND I'M PRETTY GOOD SHAPE AND HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS BUT I DNT GU TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP I MEAN OVER AND OVER AND OVER BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP PART IS SO EMOTIONALLY LAID IN IT'S THE PART THAT GETS CARVED OUT RIGHT FALSELY CARVED OUT THE THE MOST I BUT IT CAN HAPPEN IN ANY ARENA OF LIFE WHERE WE MAKE OURSELVES SPECIAL IN A WAY THAT REALLY IS BLACK MAGIC OR IS BEING CURSED RIGHT YOU OVE THE MACHINERY RIGHT THE ABILITY THE FUNCTION TO TO GO ABOUT PURSUING THE THINGS YOU WANT AND GET THEM RIGHT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD PARADIME ACCEPT ABOUT SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU RIGHT THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT IISN'T WE'RE PPLYING THE SAME MACHINERY OF SELF BECAUSE WE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS PEOPLE WANT IN A BROAD SCALE RIGHT LIKE I WOULD LIKE PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS I WOULD LIKE PERSONAL SUCCESS I WOULD LIKE TO DO WELL IN MY FAMILY UNIT AND BE A GOOD FAMILY MEMBER I WOULD LIKE ROMANCE BU SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AREAS OF SELF RIGHT AND WE WILL MAKE OURSELVES SPECIAL BY C ARVING OUT ONE AND THEN APPLYING BLACK MAGIC OR SOME CURSED STATE THAT THEN TAKES THAT AWAY FROM US AND THAT CREATES TREMENDOUS CONSTERNATION THAT WILL THROW ALL OF THOSE CUPBOARDS IN THOSE PYRAMIDS OFF BALANCE BECAUSE I WE DON'T LIKE THAT LIKE THAT SEEMS MYSTERIOUS AND OMINOUS OUKNOW WHAT IS THERE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT'S ABOUT BEING CURSED SO YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMETHING AND THEN THAT MAKES ANGER AND FRUSTRATION IN US A MORE LIKELY THAT WILL ACT OUT OR WILL BE FRUSTRATED AND WE START ENJOING THINGS LESS I SOMETIMES A PERSON CAN WALL SOMETHING OFF LIKE THAT THEY CAN GO FORWARD WITH THE REST OF LIFE MEANIT AFFECTS THEM BUT IT'S NOT OBVIOUS IS NOT OTHER MIND ALL THE TIME WHICH IS WHY THE PROCESS OF SELF INQUIRY CAN REVEAL IMPORTANT THINGS I OH LI GI PRETEND THAT I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS AND IS THE ONLY WHYLE I DO THAT IS THE ONLY THING I'M NOT DOING VERY WELL AND BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME I'S NOT SOMETHING I GET WHY BECAUSE I GOT OTHER THINGS SO I DON'T GET THAT OQE NOW OR WERE REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT THAT AND SOMETIMES IT CAUSES VERY VERY BIG PROBLEMS WHERE A PERSON WHO WHO A PERSON CAN BUILD AN EXTERNAL SENSE OF SELF THAT SOOTHE SOME OF THEIR VONERABILITIES SO THAT CAN PRESENT IN A CERTAIN WAY BUT UNDERNEATH OF THAT THEIR HIDING THE SADNESS OR THE PAIN OF WHAT IS MISSING BUT THAT IS THEN TOT OF EATING AWAY AT THEM AND THEIR FEELINGS OF SELF ON THE INSIDE DON'T MATCH WHAT PEOPLE SEE ON THE OUTSIDE WE SEE A LOT OF THIS AND THE PROCESS OF SELF INQUIRY OF SELF EXPLORATION OF CURIOSITY ABOUT SELF CAN LEAD US TO REALIZE WHAT WE'VE CARVED OUT IF WE DON'T ALREADY REALIZE IT OR IT CAN HELP US TO SEE THAT THE CARVEOUT MAKES NO SENSE RIGHT IT'S AS IF YOU SAID WELL YO THERE NINE ROADS AROUND MY HOME AND OTHER ALL JUST REGULAR OLD ROADS I CAN DRIVE ON EIGHT OF THEM BUT NOT THE NINTH SO IT DOESN'T M KE ANY SENSE IF THERRAR THEIR SIMILAR A I IT REQUIRES THE SAME SET OF SKILLS RIFETON OR TO DRYE THE CARN A DIVISUAL ACUITY WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE ATED TO DRIVE DOWN THE NITH BUT EVEN THOUGH THAT'S A VERY MONDANE EXAMPLE BUT IT'S THAT THAT WE APPLY TO VERY IMPORTANT AND EMOTIONALLY CHARGED ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE YOU KNOW I I GET TO HAVE PHYSICAL FITNESS AND FRIENDS AND CAREER SUCCESS BUT I DON'T GET TO HAVE LOVE WE HEAR PEOPLE SAY THIS AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL WAY AF TAKING US AWAY FROM WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE IN LIFE IT TAKES US AWAY FROM THE ACTIVE AGENCY IN GRATITUDE AND ALL THE GOOD THAT COMES OF THAT WHAT UJUST SAID MAKES A LOT OF SENSE ESPECIALLY THE POINT THAT A YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE NINE ROADS AROUND US AND WE CAN DRIVE DOWN EIGHT OF THEM WHY NOT THE NINTH AM BECAUSE IT PLACES US BACK INTO THE VERB TENS AND THE ACTION TENTS OF LIKE THE CARLIC WERE A VEHICLE THE I THAT WE CAN TAKE THROUGH THE WORLD MAKE SURE CONDITIONS MATTER MAY BE ROAD NUMBER NINE HAS BOULDERS ON IT AM BUT YOU KNOW IT CAN'T BE THAT ROADS ONE THROUGH EIGHT WERE ALL JUST SMOOTH SUPER HIGHWAYS EITHER RIGHT THOSE HAD CHALLENGES AND I WE I'M NOTKINGS MYSELF AS IGOP I FOR WHOEVER'S DOING THIS A SORT OF EXERCISE AM HAD A MIND THAT WAS ABLE TO WORK AROUND THOSE BOULDERS RIGHT OF CHALLENGING PEOPLE OF A YA LIMITED FINANCES OF AM ON THESE AR LL THINGS I'VE EXPERIENCED YOU KNOW AND OF COURSE PEOPLE COME INTO THE WORLD WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CHALLENGE IN PRIVILEGE IN ACCESSIBILITY ET CETERA WE DON' WANT A DENIAL OF THAT BUT BUT THOSE OTHER EIGHT ROADS ARE RARELY IF EVER PERFECT WE SMITE I TH ROD AT ITS WETS IT'S COMPLETELY ABOUT THE SELF RIGHT AND IT'S THE REALIZATION THAT IF I BROUGHT MYSELF TO BEAR AND I GOT DOWN THE FIRST EIGHT I CAN BRING MYSELF TO BEAR AND GET DOWN THE NINTH AND I YOUR POINTING OUT I'S NOT LIKE THE FIRST EIGHT WERE EASY RIGHT MAY BE ONE OF THEM WAS REALLY PRETTY SMOOTH RIGHT BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A COUPLE OF THEM IN THERE THAT I HAVE HAVE RAISED REALLY IN A STRONG DIFFICULTIES THINGS TO SURMOUNT AND TO OVERCOME AND IT'S FROM THAT PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE FIND WITHIN OURSELVES THE COURAGE THE STRENGTH TO GO DOWN THE NINTH ROAD EVEN IF WE SEE GREATER BARRIERS EVEN IF WE'RE'LL COME AWARE NOW BUT I'M ALSO AWARE THAT I AVOIDED THAT NINTH ROAD FOR REASON RIGHT THE BOLDERS AND THE POT HOLES RIGHT THE'RE MORE SEVERE ON THAT ROAD IN FACT I'M COME WORRY THAT IT'S THAT IT'S IMPASSABLE BUT'S MEN IT CAN'T BE IMPASSABLE RIGHT IF THERE'S BOLDERS THERE I'LL AND I'LL GO RENTSOME EXCABATING EQUIPMENT OR A'LL FILL IN THE POTHOLDWAY AND AND THAT'S HOW WE GET OURSELVES TO GO FORWARD AND TEND TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND VALADAYLIC I'M AFRAID OF DOING THAT IF I WEREN'T AFRAID OF DOING IT IT WOULDHAVE DONE IT ALREADY RIGHT BUT I NOW REALIZE LIKE WHAT THE TRUTH IS AND WHAT I BROUGHT TO BEAR IN THE FIRST EIGHT AND I'M GING TO BRING MYSELF TO BEAR FOR THE NIFENCE ALSO WHEN WE RECRUIT OFTEN RESOURCES AROUND US WE MIGHT TA CON ME TELL A COUP OF OOF FRIENDS ABOUT THIS OR CLERGY MEMBER OR ATHERAPIST OR YOU KNOW A TRUSTED OTHER AND LET ME EXPLORE THIS MORE IN MYSELF AND AND THAT'S OFTEN HOW IN IN MAKING OURSELVES BETTER WE WE ENGAGE MORE WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND US AND THEN THE SUPPORT FROM SOME ONE ELSE THAT MAY HELP OF PERSON DO THAT RIGT IS SUPPORT GIVEN BACK TO THE OTHER PERSON AND THIS IS ALSO HOW WE BUILD THE BEYONDSELF IS THAT THE THE PATH TO TRAVEL DOWN THE NITH ROAD SO TO SPEAK WE DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL ALONE YOU KNOW MUCH OF THE TIME BUT THAT OFTEN ALMOST ALWAYS WASN'T IN THE PERSON'S MIND RIGHT THEY THEY PERCEIVE ON IT'S A YOUR THREE PERSON JOB TO GO DOWN S I GRIT YOU HAVE TWO FRIENDS YES CERTAINLY WERE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL DOWN CERTAIN ROADS ON THE KEY FEATURES HAVE BEEN A A DESIRE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD IUM A RECOGNITION OF THE LANDSCAPE BUT NOT TRYING TO TAKE ON THE WHOLE THING ALL AT ONCE IM AND THEN FINDING REALLY GOOD PEOPLE AND I AM FRANKLY REALLY TRYING TO AVOID PEOPLE THAT THE SEEM A YOU KNOW POISONOUS TO THE JOURNEY RIGHT THAT WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW THROW I TOXIC THINGS INTO THE ENGINE OF MY VEHICLE AND AND THAT'S PUTTING A LOT ON THEM BUT M U YOU KNOW IT JUST FELT AS IF GOING DOWN THOSE OTHER ROADS WAS TOO VALUABLE AN EXPEDITION TO SPEND TIME ON AND WITH PEOPLE THAT IT WASN'T HELPFUL TO SPEND TIME WITH IM AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD PEOPLE THAT IT PRESENTED THEMSELVES WITH UM EXAMPLES I THINK I YOU KNOW THIS WHERE IT COMES TO MINEIT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT YOU KNOW GET A FRIEND WHO SAYING YOU CAN DO THIS AND HEARE'S WHY IT WERTHERAPIS AYS AYS HE CAN DO THIS AND HERE'S WHY BUT THAT UM THERE EXAMPLES IN THE WORLD LIKE ALL THIS PERSON DID THIS IM I THINK WHEN WE HAVE CHALLENGES IN A CERTAIN DOMAIN O THAT NINTH ROAD SO TO SPEAK IM I KNOW FOR MYSELF THAT I KNOW HIM IN A PLACE OF OF FUTILITY WHEN I START TO U REFLECTIVELY ORIENT TOWARDS OTHERS THAT HAVE HAD A PROBLEM GETTING DOWN THAT ROAD YOU KNOW LIKE ALL LIKE I RECOGNIZES OTHER PERSONS  GOT AT ROADS RON THREA BUT NOT NINE IM AND IT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE COURSE OF THE SERIES REALLY THAT I YOU KNOW WHY NOT PICKTIFFERENT EXAMPLES IF YOUARE GOING ON A JOURNEY AN IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT JOURNEY AND IT'S A DIFFICULT JOURNEY BUT IT CAN BE AUSOME BRING GOOD PEOPLE RIGHT HAVE THEM ON YOUR JOURNEY BEYON THERE JOURNEY AND THEN YOU THINK WHY WOULD A PERSON NOT BRING GOOD PEOPLE IF I WERE GOING ON A JOURNEY AND IS GOING TO BE ARDUOUS BUT WHILE WE COULD SEE AMAZING THINGS ALONG THE WAY I CAN BANG AND BRING COUPLE PEOPLE WITH ME I M I OWN WAN TO CHOOSE A COUBLE PEOPLE WO'RE LAZY YOU KNOW SOME WHO YOUSAO DON'T LOOK AT THE WORLD AROUND THEM AND NKNOF SOME THAT WON'T I BE HELPFUL TO SOMEBODY ELSE A NEE S A WI WOOD ONE CHOOSE THAT RIGHT IT COMES BACK TO THE SELF RIGHT IF A PERSON NOVER TIME BIT ANY JOURNEY REGASS THE JOURNEY OF LIFE RIGHT IF A PERSON IS CHOOSING PEOPLE YOU WOULDN'T CHOOSE TO BE ON THE JOURNEY WITH YOUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE WORTH BETTER IGHT AND IF YOU THINK THAT YOURE WORTH BETTER YOU WON'T CHOOSE THE PEOPLE YOU'LL SAY I WANT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE ME I CAN BE DILIGENT PERPERCEPTIVE COLLEDIAL COOPERATIVE SO ON GNG TO SURROUND MYSELF WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT AND IF WE WE LOOK BEYOND OURSELVES AT GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND AT CULTURE THE HEALTHIER WE ARE THE MORE WE ALIE WITH HEALTHY PEOPLE AND THE MORE HEALTHYE WE ARE BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING OURSELVES HEALTHY WE GET HEALTHIER GROUPS OF PEOPLE THE JOURNEY IS BETTER FOR ALL OF US AND THIS IS HOW WE CAN MAKE THE WHOLE CULTURE BETTER RIGHT POTENTIALLY THIS IS HOW WE CAN MAKE LIFE ON THE PLANET BETTER BUT IT HAS TO START SOMEWHERE SO IT HAS TO START WITH THE EYE I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE MESSAGE THAT YOU KNOW IF YOUR HTTING OFF ON A JOURNEY THAT'S REALLY MEANINGFUL TO YOU KNOW GO WITH AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU INTERACT WITH GOOD PEOPLE AH DISASHALLY I A PLACE WHERE A YOUR REFERENCE TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND ON LINE COMMUNITIES IS ACTUALLY A WORTH WHILE AND CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S EASY FOR US TO CAN ROLL OUR EYES AT LIKE SELF HELP AN THINGS LIKE THAT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE COMMUNITIES ON LINE A THAT I CONSIDER MYSELF A PART OF BUT OF WHICH I AM MANY OTHER PEOPLE VE DERIVED A A LOT OF STRENGTH A LOT OF AN REASSURANCE AND CONFIDENCE RIGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ISOLATED A THEY MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO ONE OR TWO PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAT THEY REALLY VALUE BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE PERHAPS ALSO BUSY WITH OTHER PEOPLE OR UM I CAN REMEMBER BEING A STUDENT ALONE IN MY STUDIO APARTMENT AS A AS AN UNDERGRADUATE A'M FEELING VERY MUCH AGAINST THE GRAIN OF MY LOCAL ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW TOO MUCH PARTYING FOR ME AT THE TIME MEANING I WASN'T PARTING AND THERE WAS A LOT OF PARTING AROUND ME AND HAD I BEEN A BETTER STUDENT HIGH SCHOOL I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HEALTH HEALTHILY ENGAGE IN THAT BUT I JUST WASN'T ABLE SO FEELING PRE ISOLATED BUT KNOWING I WAS ON A PASO IN THAT CASE IT WAS ONE PROFESSOR ONE GRADUATE STUDENT AND A HELL OF A LOT OF BOOKS AND MUSIC THAT TO ME JUST CARRIED ME THROUGH YOU KNOW NOWADAYS I'M FORTUNATE HAVE MANY MORE A DIRECT RESOURCES IN MY LIFE OF OF AMAZING PEOPLE BUT II JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT BECAUSE I THINK IN THIS DISCUSSION AROUND SELF CARE AND OM THE VERYUST PRACTICES I THINK THERE ARE SURE TO BE PEOPLE WHO ARE YON THAT THAT KID THAT WOMAN THAT MAN THAT'S YOU KNOW LIKE ALONE AND A ROOMTHING LIKE OCABU HOW RIGHT I I SEE THE THE GROSER ONCE A WEEK AND I AND I SEE MY NEIGHBOR AND THEY DON'T EVEN SAY HALLO YOU KNOW AND AND I KNOW HOW TO START TO ACCESS SOME OF THESE BETTER CONNARSIONS NAVIGATING THE ONLINE WORLD IS NAVIGATING THE WORLD RIGHTAT COMES DOWN TO UNDERSTANDING AN CHOICE SO WE'R UNDERSTANDING AS BEST WE CAN WE'RE MAKING CHOICE AS BEST WE CAN THEN WE'LL FIND GREAT THINGS ON LINE THERE ARE GREAT THINGS TO FIND ON LINE SAME AS TRUE OF LIFE IF WE'RE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING THAT FOR EXAMPLE ELIES A AROUND HATRED AROUND ACTING OUT TROUND THINGS THAT MAKE US UNHAPPY EVEN AROUND COMMISSERATION INSTEAD OF THINKING THAT HOW WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER THEN WE BRING OURSELVES IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAT'S LIFE IF WE UNDERSTAND AND WE CHOOSE AS BEST WE CAN WE WILL LEAD OURSELF TO BETTER PLACES SUCH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE AND IS A PERFECT SAGUAY INTO A QUESTION THAT I AND 'M CERTAIN MANY MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT ANGER AND NOT JUST ANGER FROM INTERPERSONAL CONFLICT LIKE SOMEBODY SAID SOME THING AND IT REALLY UPSET ME BUT STUFF THAT WE SEE SUP THAT WE OBSERVE IN THE WORLD COULD BE UM A ACTS AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE WORDS AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE OR YOU KNOW THAT WE TAKE REFERENCE TO AND THINK MANY PEOPLE FEEL YANKED AROUND BY UM YOU KNOW EVEN DRAGGED A BY SOMETHING THEY SEE AND AND THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT OF THER HEAD NOW THERE COULD BE ALL SORTS OF REASONS RELATED TO EACHEN ALL OF US WHY WE CAN'T GET OUT OF ER HEAD WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO ET CETERA BUT ACCORDING TO THE MAP OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT FOR US THINGS THAT GET IN THE WAY OF THAT GENERATIVE DRIVE  ARE REALLY QUITE POISONOUS TO OUR WELL BEING AND THE WELL BEING OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THAT GENERATIVE DRIVE ISABOUT LEARNING CREATION AND YES ATTENDS TO BE PRO SOCIAL YES AND  IN SO MANY WAYS TELL US ABOUT ANGER AND HOW FROM A FRAME OF REFERENCE OF TRY TO ENGAGE IN SELF CARE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT OUR ANGER AND WORK WITH OUR ANGER IN WAYS THAT CAN PERHAPS EVEN HELP US AND NOT HARM US IN IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO DEFINE THREE WORDS AN THE WORD TO START WITH HIS AFFECT SO AFFECT IS AROUSED IN US RIGHT MEANING WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER IT SO ANGER IS AN AFFECT IT IS AROUSED IN US THE IDEA BEING THAT IF A PERSON IS WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND SOME ONE JUMPS IN FRONT OF THEM AND SHOVES THEM ANGER IS AROUSED IN THEM THEY DON'T CHOOSE TO BE ANGRY IN FACT THE BODY REACTS AND HAS ALSO TO FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSES BEFORE THE PERSON EVEN REALIZES THAT THEYRE ANGRY SO WE CAN'T CONTROL WHAT IS AROUSED IN US IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM WE CAN IN THE LONGER TERM IF I WAS SHORT FUSED AND I GET ANGRY REALLY EASILY YOU KNOW I CAN'T REALY CONTROL THA IN NEXT TEN MINUTES RIGHT MEANING THE AFFECT THAT'S AROUSED IM YEI CAN O DIFFERENT THINGS WITH IT BUT I CAN'T CHANGE WHAT'S CREATED IN ME BUT IF I'M LIVING A BETTER LIFE TAKING BETTER CARE OF MYSELF THE GENARATIVE DRIVE IS BETTER EXPRESS Y I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN MY LIFE THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MECHANISMS THAT AROUSE SO MUCH ANGER START TO AROUSE LESS ANGER SO BY TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES WE AROUSE LESS ANGER BUT ANGER IS AROUSED IN US THE NEXT WORD IS FEELING RIGHT AN IN THE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS FOR THESE WORDS BUT THE WAY WORD TO FINING THEM AFFECT IS AROUSED FEELING IS WHEN WE TAKE THAT AFFECT AND WE RELATE IT TO THE SELF IT'S THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS ON THE WAY UP CAUSE THE AROUSAL OF AFFECT IS VERY DEEP IN THE BRAIN AS IT COMES UP THE NEXT THING IT DOES IS RELATE THAT AFFECT TOSELF SO THIS IS WERE THAT THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A PERSON WHO SPILL SOMETHING THEY ARE ANGRY THAT THING IS SPILLED IT RAISES ANGER IN THEM THEN THEY BECOME AWARE AND THEY MATCH THE ANGER TOSELF AND SAY WHAT A DOMMIG RIGHT WHAT A JERK I'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING RIGHT THEY SAY IT INSIDE RITE BECAUSE THE ANGER GETS ENACTED AGAINST THE SELF NOW WHAT WHAT HOW WOULD WE LIKE THAT TO GO WHERE THE PERSONS TAKING BETTER CARE OF HEMSELVES SO WHEN THEY SPILL SOMETHING LESS ANGER IS AROUSED AND BY THE TIME IT GETS TO CONSCIOUSNESS THERE'S LESS ANGER SO ITS EASIER TO MANAGE AND THERE'S A STRONGER SENSE OF SELF ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PILLARS AND THE CUBBERS ARE ARE IN A GOOD PLACE THAN THE PERSON IS BETTER ABLE TO MANAGE WHAT ANGER MAKES IT RIGHT TO FEELING AND THEN TO SAY IN ALL CAY EVERYBODY SPILL SOMETHING NOW AND THEN WHAT EVIDENT TO CLEAN IT UP IN THE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO ENACT THE ANGER TOWARDS THEMSELVES ISO AFFECT FEELING AND THEN EMOTION TO EMOTION IS WHEN WE RELATE THE AFFECT IN THE FEELING TO OTHERS IN THE WORLD AROUND US SO FOR EXAMPLE A PERSON MIGHT SPILL SOMETHING AND THEN THAT AROUSES ANG ER AND NOW THEY GET TO THE FEELING PART BUT THEY HAVE A SET OF UNHEALTHY DEFENCES AND THEY DON'T THINK THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THINGS THEYRE RESPONSIBLE FOR SO THEY JUST KEEP THAT THAT LOAD OF ANGER RIGHT THAT THAT AFFECT UPWARDS UNTIL THEY GET TO EMOTION  THEN THEY DECIDE THAT WAS IT MY FAUGHT IT WAS YOURS AND THAT'S WHY MAYBE THEY KICK THE DOG ERE THEY FLAP SOMEBODY OR THEY SAY SOMETHING MEAN LIKE THIS HAPPENS SO IF IT HAPPENS A LOT LIKE THIS IS PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT'S GOING ON US A LOT ABOUT NEGATIVE EMOTIONS MERTHERE CAN BE DRAMATIC EXAMPLES BUT THEIR SMALLER EXAMPLES THAT ARE WINDING THEIR WAY THROUGH OUR LIVES AND THE BETTER WE TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES THE LESS AROUSED NEGATIVE AFFECT WE HAVE AND THE BETTER WE COPE WITH IT WHEN IT GETS TO THE LEVEL OF THE IY AND WHEN IT GETS TO THE LEVEL OF THE YOU RIGHT AN IF WE THINK ABOUT PRO SOCIAL COLLABORATIVE BEHAVIORS VERSES THE INACTION OF ANGER ON A LARGE SCALE RIGHT IF BY THE TIME IT GETS TO YOU THERE'S STILL LOT OF ANGER THERE IT IS VERY EASY TO THEN PAINT WITH A BROAD BRUSH RIGHT OH THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT DEMOGRAPHIC RIGHT THE PROMES ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE ME IGT THAT'S WHERE ANGER IS AT ITS MOST DANGEROUS SO THE IDEA OF HAVING THE NEGATIVE AFFECT UNDER CONTROL HAVING THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE CONTROL MECHANISMS IGHT KEEPS US FROM GETTING TO THAT BROADER LEVEL THE LEVEL OF YOU AND THEN WORKING IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT PRO SOCIAL BUT ARE ANTI SOCIAL AND AND THIS I THINK ALSO RELATES TO WHAT WE CAN FIND ON LINE RIGHT WE CAN FIND ALL MINE EVERYTHING WE CAN FIND IN THE WORLD SO THEN WE HAVE A CHOICE ARE WE GANG TO WORK ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT CHOICES ARE WE GOING TO MAKE ABOUT HOW WE'RE ENGAGING IN THE WORLD AND FOR CHOOSING THE GOOD THINGS WERE TAKING BETTER CARE OF OURSELVES AND WERE BETTER CITI CITIZENS OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS OF OUR FAMILY UNITS AND ULTIMATELY OF OUR SOCIETIES I'VE OB SERVED ANGER DIRECTED MY WAY CERTAINLY I'M FAR FAR FROM PERFECT I HAVE THOUSANDS OF FLAWS AND I'VE DIRECTED ANGER TOWARDS OTHERS AND WAYS THAT I WISH I HADN'T UM A COMMON OBSERVANCE I'VE HAD ABOUT MYSELF AND OTHERS IS THAT WHEN ANGRY A LOT OF VALUABLE TIME IS WASTED INSTEAD OF PLACING MY EFFORTS WITHIN THE GENERATIVE DRIVE MY CREATING THINGS THAT I REALLY VALUE I'M THE ANGER BECOMES AN IMMENSE DISTRACTION YET AND I'VE SEEN THIS A LOT IM NOT JUST ON UNIVERSITY CANPASSES UM BUT ONE PLACE I HAVE SEEN IT IS A WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE SOONER POSTOC THERE WOULD BE SOME INTERACTION FOR BE EITHER BETWEEN THEM IM IN THE LABORATORY I WAS IN ALTHOUGH RARELY I BUT MORE OFTEN IT WAS ABOUT SOME INTERACTION WITH A BETWEEN A STUNOR POSTOCK AND SOME ONE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND SO THEY COME IN AND IF YOU REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT AND THERE'S A TENDENCY TO YOU KNOW TRY NDO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER WHICH I THINK IS HEALTHY BUT THEN IT WAS LIKE THE THIS WOULD JUST CONTINUE AND CONTINUE IN THE PERSON OF YOU LIKE SITTING IN THEIR CHAIRS LIKE REALLY UPSETTING AND SOMETIMES THESE WERE REALLY UPSETTING OCCURRENCE IS THAT WARRANTED TAKING SOME TIME AND JUST REALLY STOPPING BUT OFTEN IE FELT LIKE THINGS JUST KEPT SPIRALLING UP IND SPIRALING OVLANDS LIKE HALF WAY THROUGH THE DAY AND AGEN I'M NOT IMMUNED FROM THIS BUT BUT I OBSERVED IT MORE THAN I FELT AT CERTAINLY UM LOT'S A LOT OF TIME WASTED LATELAGS AT DAYS I PERHAPS EVEN WEEKS AND MONTHS AND THEN THERE'S THE SLEEP LOSS THAT GOES WITH ANGER UH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA AND ON LINE COMMUNITIES THAT'S NEW AND UNIQUE IS THAT USED TO BE WHEN KIDS WENT HOME FROM SCHOOLER WE GO HOME FROM WORK YOU WOULD SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED THERE BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO MORE INCOMING UH YOU KNOW PEOPLE WEREN'T CALLING YOU ON THE PHONE TELLING YOU YOU KNOW THINGS THAT YOU DON'T LIKE OR TALKING ABOUT OTHERS AND WAYS THAT YU DON'T LIKE WERES ALLYOU HAVE TO DO NOW AS PICK UP SOCIAL MEDIA AND IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY I'M DELIBERATE AND HOW YOU INTERACT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND ON THE INTERNAT AND WHICH NEWS ARTICLES YOU READ AND WHICH ENS YOU HOU SCROLL PAST I MA THAT CAN BE ACCESSIBLE AT TWO IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU'RE UP ABOUT THE THING THAT WAS ANGERING YOU DURING THE DAY THAT IS NEW RIGHT  N N REQUIRES IT ELEVATED LEVELS OF VILIGENS RIGHT HIGH LEVELS OF ANGER BRING VOLATILITY AND CONFUSION RIGHT AND THAT DOESN'T SERVE ANY ONE OR ANYTHING WELL LOWER LEVELS OF ANGER CAN BE HEALTHY RIGHT I'M ANGRY T THAT AND  AND AND I WANT TO TRY AND MAKE IT RIGHT OR I'M ANGRY AT THAT AND I'M GOOD  HAVE MY SAY AND WRONG UND HAVE MY VOTE IN IT OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE LOWER LEVELS OF ANGER O K THEY CAN INFORM US TIT CAND GUIDE OUR BEHAVIORS BUT WHEN WE GET TO HIGH LEVELS OF ANGER IT'S VOLATILITY AND CONFUSION THE PERSON CEASES TO THEN BE EFFECTIVE AND IT'S AN EXAMPLE WHEN YOU ARE TELLING ME ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE SOLO POTCASTS RIGHT AND AND HOW YOUR AGENCY AND YOUR GRATITUDE REALLY AN ACTION AND YOUR FEELING N YOUR FEELING THE THE PEACE AND AND YU'RE DELIGHTED AND YOU YO THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AS AF THE FOR IN YOU RIGHT  THEN IIS IT WHAT IF WE ADD A LITTLE BIT OF ANGER EVEN RIGHT TO KIND TO MAKE Y U AND THEN YOUR RESPONSES LIKE ALL WOULD ALL COME OFF LINE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE YOU'R DOING SOMETHING THAT CALLS FOR LIKE YOU TO REALLY BE AT YOUR BEST FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS SO EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF ANGER IS TOO MUCH BUT ITS IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THIS THING THAT THAT IS SO GOOD FOR YOU YOU'RE LIVING IN THE PLACE THAT IF IF YOU COULD HAVE ALL OF EXISTENCE BE LIKE YOU FEEL THEN RIGHT YOU WOULD LOVE IT YOU COULD BRING IT TO ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE LIKE THAT'S THE NERVANA WERE WO'RE GOING FOR IN YOUR ACTIVELY LIVING IT BUT WE COULD THROW IT OFF AND RUIN IT WITH EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF ANGER RIGHT SO I IT'S IT'S AN EXAMPLE THAT CT MODELS FOR US HOW HIGHER LEVELS OF ANGER CALLS PROBLEMS AND SITUATIONS THAT ARE NOT SO RARIFIED AS THAT HIGH LEVELS OF ANGER MAKE OR SMEBODY BLURDING OUT SOMEBODY ATTACKING SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SANG SOMETHING THEY SHOULD AND SOMEBODY MAKING A BAD DECISION NOW ANGER ISN'T GOOD FOR US AT HIGH LEVELS AND WE CAN DECREASE IT BY MAKING OURSELVES HEALTHIER TH T THEN WE MAKE LESS OF IT AND WE CONTROL IT BETTER AND WE KEEP OURSELVES AT THE LOVE TO MODERATE LEVELS OF ANGER HOPEFULLY LOW AND NO ANGER S NOT GOOD HIGH ANGER IS NOT GOOD LET'S TRY AND LIVE IN THE LOW RANGE OCCASIONALLY SOMETHING IS VERY DISTRESSING WE RISE UP TO MODERATE THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE ANGER IN A HEALTHY PLACE WHEN WE SET OUT ON THIS A JOURNEY TO A EXPLORE WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH I I HAD NO EXPECTATION IM THAT YOU WOULD DELIVER TO US THIS INCREDIBLE MAP OF HOW TO EXPLORE OUR INNER TERRITORY AND THAT YOU WOULD SPELL OUT SUCH CRISP AND CLEAR IDEALS UM OF STATES AND WAYS OF BEING AND THINGS TO ACCESS IM NOR DID I A KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THE OTHER DRIVES THAT RESIDE WITHIN US YOU IN THINKING ABOUT SELF CARE IM AND IN THING ABOUT THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGED WITH OFTEN YOU KNOW I I MADE OUT A LITTLE LIST AH NOT JUST ANGER BUT THINGS LIKE SCARED EMBARRASSED GRIEVING DEJECTED TIRED CONFUSED STOCK YET AND THEN I WROTE YOU KNOW INFINITE NUMBER OF THESE I I MEAN THERE HAVE TO BE  AN INFINITE NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE FACE IM AN INFINITE NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND PERHAPS EVEN AN INFINITE COMMINATION OF THOSE THINGS THAT PEOPLE FACE AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CAN MAKE IT ALL SEEM LIKE A GIANT OPPRESSIVE CLOUD WITHIN US AND AROUND US AND YET WHAT YOU'VE PROVIDED IS REALLY A A A A PATH OF CLARITY BECAUSE IT'S A PATH THAT CERTAINLY INCLUDES A LOT OF COMPLEXITY DOWN IN THOSE PILLARS THE BOTTOM YOU STRUCTURE OF SELF FUNCTION OF SELF BUT YOU'VE DIRECTED US TOWARD LOOKING INTO THAT COMPLEXITY LOOKING INTO THOSE CUPBOARDS AS A WAY TO ARRIVE AT ANSWERS THAT BRING US TOWARD MORE SIMPLICITY EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENCY GRATITUDE PEACE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT AND THIS INCREDIBLY A ATTRACTIVE THING A THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT THAT IS REALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ANY IN ALL OF US IT'S THERE IN EVERY ONE OF US IN PROVIDING THIS PATH OF CLARITY I'M AND AGAIN I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT WHETHER NOT YOU FEEL YOUR DOING WELL IN LIFE I'M MAYBEVEN IN ALL DOMAINS OF LIFE OR WHETHER NOT YOUR EXPERIENCING CHALLENGE IN ANY OR PERHAPS EVEN ALL DOMAINS OF LIFE GOING INTO THOSE COVERTS IS CLEARLY OF IMMENSE VALUE AND YOU'VE I SO U GRACIOUSLY SPELLED OUT HOW WE CAN DO THAT I'M REGARDLESS OF RESOURCES REALLY A IT SOUNDS LIKE ALL IT REQUIRES IS A DESIRE TO BE BETTER AND FEEL BETTER AND DO BETTER AND A A WILLINGNESS TO TO EXPLORE CURIOSITY I IF I HAD TO SUMMARIZE THE WHOLE THING IN TWO WORDS I WOULD SAY BE CURIOUS KE AUS CURIOUS OPENS THE DOOR TO ALL OF IT CURIOSITY ABOUT SELF CURIOSITY ABOUT LIFE LEADST ALL THE GOOD THINGS BUT WHAT YOU'VE GIVEN US IS OF IMMENSE VALUE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW THAT I AND I'M MANY MANY

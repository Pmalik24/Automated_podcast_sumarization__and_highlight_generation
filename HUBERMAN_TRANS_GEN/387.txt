WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LATCONGENS NCO SCIENCE  SCIENCE PAC  TO E FERLI  I MAN DREW HUBERMEN AND O PROFESSOR OF NUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD' SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR RENA MALIKE DOCTOR RENA MALIKUE IS ABORD CERTIFIED EUROLOGIST AND PELVIC SURGION SHE IS AN EXPERT IN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE EUROLOGICAL PELVIC FLOOR AND SEXUAL HEALTH DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE DOCTOR MALIKUE ANSWERS THE MOST COMMONLY ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT URINARY PELVIC AND SEXUAL HEALTH FOR INSTANCE HOW TO AVOID GETTING UTIIZE URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS WE ALSO DISCUSS PELVIC FLORINATOMY AND FUNCTION AS IT RELATES TO OVERCOMING AN OVERLI TIGHT OR AN OVERLI RELAXED PELVIC FLOOR THIS IS A KEY DISTINCTION THAT MOST PEOPLE AREN'T AWARE OF MANY PEOPLE HERE ABOUT THE NEED TO SO CALLED STRENGTHEN THEIR PELVIC FLOOR BUT IN FACT MANYD PEOPLE NEED TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE THEY NEED TO LEARN TO RELAX THEIR PELVIC FLOOR IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PROPER EUROLOGIC AND SEXUAL FUNCTION SO TODAY YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT THAT YOU WILL ALSO LEARN ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH AS IT RELATES TO ERECTILE FUNCTION AS IT RELATES TO THINGS LIKE VAGENAL LUBRECATION AS IT RELATES TO ORGASM WE SEPARATE OUT VERY CAREFULLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGICAL DESIRE AND A ROUSAL THAT OCCURS WITHIN THE GENITALS THEMSELVES AND DOCTRMALI HILIGHTS SOME IMPORTANT MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT SEXUAL DISFUNCTION FOR INSTANCE THAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT HORMONES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL DISFUNCTION BUT IN REALITY HORMON DISREGULATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF SEXUAL DISFUNCTION AND YET PELVIC FLOOR AND BLOOD FLOW RELATED ISSUES CAN ACCOUNT FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES OF SEXUAL DISFUNCTION IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES SO I ASSURE YOU THAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS GOING TO ILLUMINATE MANY NEW AREAS OF INFORMATION MANY NEW TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS THAT I'M G ESING MOST PEOPLE HAVE NOT HEARD OF WE TALK ABOUT THE NURL VASCULAR THAT IS BLOODFLOW RELATED AND MUSCULAR ASPECTS OF BLATTER FUNCTION PROSTATE FUNCTION SCHENES GLANDS WE TALK ABOUT VAGIONAL HEALTH AS WELL AS PENILE HEALTH WE TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS AS IT RELATES TO DIFFERENT STAGES ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN IT IS A FAR REACHING IN INDEPTH AND PRACTICAL CONVERSATION THAT I'M CERTAIN EVERYONE WILL GLEAN IMPORTANT TAKE AWAYS FROM NOW BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE CONTENT OF TO DAY'S EPISODE IS SECUAL IN NATURE WE TALK VERY DIRECTLY ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SECUAL BEHAVIOR AND WE TALK ABOUT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE CLINITION AND BIOLOGIST SO IT IS A MEDICAL SLASH SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION THAT SAID WE CAN'T BE AWARE OF WARE THIS PODCAST IS BEING PLAYED AND WHO IS LISTENIN AND I ASSERT THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THEMES WITHIN TO DAY'S DISCUSSION THAT WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN HOW YOUNG WELL THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT FOR US TO DISCERN WE REALIZE THAT DIFFERENT PARENTS IN DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS SHOULD BE THE ARBITERS OF WHAT SORTS OF INFORMATION THEIR CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO OR NOT SO MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN WHATSOEVER THAT THE CONTENT OF TO DAY'S EPISODE WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO BE HEARDE BY SOME MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY THAT YOU PLEASE LISTEN TO THE PODCAST FIRST OR AT LEAST CHECK THE TIME STAMPS WHERE WE'VE DETAILED WHAT SPECIFIC TOPICS ARE COVERED AND THEN TO MAKE YOUR DECISION ACCORDINGLY I SHULL MENTION THAT NOT ONLY AS DOCTOR MALIKUE STILL AN ACTIVE CLINITION SHE SEES PATIENCS DAILY OUT OF HER CLINIC IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE PROVIDED A LINK TO THAT CLINIC IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS SHE'S ALSO AUTHORED DOZENS OF HIGH QUALITY PERVIEED

AND HELP US CONTINUE WITH BRINGING YOU THE BEST POSSIBLE CONTENT HERE AT THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST AND AS ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN SCIENCE AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR RENA MALIK DOCTOR RENA MALIK WELCOME THANK YOU THINK YOU THEN MATCHES NOT NARETO BE HERE I'M DELIGHT TO HAVE YOU HERE I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOUR CONTENT I FIND THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DELIVER CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT SECXUAL HEALTH YOUROLOGY PELVICK FLOOR LEBIDO AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE OF IMMENSE INTEREST TO PEOPLE BUT THAT ORDINARILY PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE TO GET THE HIGH QUALITY INFORMATION AND  COMING TO YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION MEANS THEY ARE GOING TO GET THE HIGHEST QUALITY INFORMATION I TRULY BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE AS EVERYONE WILL SOON HERE TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A A VERY FRANK DISCUSSION BUT ONE THAT'S REALLY GROUNDED IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE AROUND SEXUAL HEALTH AND RELATED TOPICS THESE ARE TOPICS THAT TYPICALLY PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT IN SCHOOL MAY BE AT HOME FROM FRIENDS USUALLY OVER HEARING THINGS I SUPPOSED TO DIRECT EXPLORATORY CONVERSATION ON LINE PORNOGRAPHY AND AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE GROWING UP YOU KNOW THERE WAS EDUCATION AROUND SEXUAL HEALTH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ET CETERA THAT WAS MORE ORIENTED TOWARD THE FEVER OF THINGS LIKE AS TEA EYES FEAR OF UNWONTED PRAGNANCY ALL OF WHICH OF HOURSE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT BUT FAR LESS ABOUT OM SORT OF THAT HEALTHY VERSIONS OF SEXUAL HEALTH RIGHT YE ABSOLUTELY SO THIS IS AN ESPECIUALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION IT'S ALSO ONE THAT I THINK HAS A BACK DROP THAT WE SHOULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT BECAUSE THE INFORMATION IS GLEANED FROM MULTIBLE SOURCES AND BECAUSE THERE ARE IM LESS YOU SAY A INFLUENCES OUT THERE THAT RELATE TO THE MORALITY OF DIFFERENT PRACTICES THAT THERE CAN BE SHAME THERE CAN BE MISUNDERSTANDING THERE CAN BE SECRECY AND THAT FURTHER LEADS TO MISINFORMATION SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT TO DAY A YOU CAN CLARIFY THINGS FOR US AND WE'RE GOING TO STAY OUT OF THOSE UM TRENCHES AND LAST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT BECAUSE A NUMBER OF TERMS WILL CERTAINLY COME UP THAT I THINK FOR SOME PEOPLE I'M THEY'RE NOT USED TO HEARING AND GENERAL DISCOURSE I'M JUST GOING TO GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY NOW PENUS VIGINA ANUS PROSTATE YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS THERE I WE'REN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT LIBIDO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT INTERCOURSE OR AL SEXS ANAL SECTS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THAT SO I JUST WANT TO GET THAT OUT THERE SO THAT A WE CAN REDUCE THE A SHOCK A THE SHOCK RESPONSE ELOF IT MAYE TALK ABOUT ALL OF IT GREAT SO TO START THINGS OFF IN ANTICIPATION THIS EPISODE I SOLICITED FOR QUESTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND I GOT THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF OVERLAP IN THE QUESTIONS SO TO START OFF I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT PELVIC FLOOR G BECAUSE BOTH MALES AND FEMALES HAVE A PELVIC FLOOR AND MYNERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S A MUSCULAR COMPONENT THERE'S A NURAL MUSCULAR COMPONENT THERE'S A BLOOD FLOW COMPONENT WHAT IS A HEALTHY PELVIC FLOOR WHAT DOES HEALTHY PELVIC FLOOR DO AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE HEALTH ISSUES THAT AN UNHEALTHY PELVIC FLOOR CREATES AND SOME OF THE WAYS TO AMELIORATE AN UNHEALTHY PLVIC FLOOR ABSOLUTELY SO PALVIC FLOOR VERY SIMPLY IS BASICALLY A BOWL OF MUSCLES THAT'S CONNECTED TO BONES THAT HOLD UP ALL YOUR ORGAN SO BASICALLY IN YOUR PALVIS THERE'S ALL THESE MUSCLES THERE AND THERE FUNCTION IS ESSENTIALLY MANY IT IT HELPS WITH ERINATION DEFICATION SACTUAL FUNCTION IT HELPS WITH POSTURE AND SO HAVING A STRONG HEALTHY PALVIC FLOOR CAN MEAN THAT YOU'RE HAVING NORMAL URINATION YOU'RE HAVING NORMAL DEFICATION YOUR HAVING GREAT SECTS AND THAT YOU ARE ALSO NOT HAVING AILMENTS LIKE BACKPANE OR ISSUES RELATED TO THOSE THOSE FUNCTIONS AND THOSE ORGANS AND SO YOU DONT EPALVIC FLOR IS IS SO IMPORTANT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS AN WE DEAL WITH IT A LOT AS YOUROLOGISTS BECAUSE IT'S SO INTERGIRAL TO THESE FUNCTIONS THAT WE TAKE CARE OF AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN UNHEALTHY PALVIC FLOOR IT CAN VARY FROM PERSON TO PERSON AND WHILE YOU HEAR ABOUT IT A LOT AND WOMEN MEN ALSO SUFFER FROM PALVIC FLOORIDOUS FUNCTION ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE PALVIC FLOOR SO BES I PUBLIC LOR'S FUNCTION HAPPENS A LOT WHEN YOURE DOING THINGS LIKE IF YOU WERE TO GO TO THE GIM AND DO REPETITIONS OF OF ANY SORT OF EXERCISE AND YOU DIDN'T REST THEN THAT MUSCLE WOULD BECOME CONTRACTED AN SHORT VERY SIMILARLY IF YOUR PALVIC FLOOR IS OVERSTRAINED IT CAN BECOME CONTRACTED AND SHORT AND TIGHT ALL THE TIME AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT IT MAY JUST BE A FUNCTION OF STRESS ANXIETY A OR OVER USE OR POSTURE PROBLEMS THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR PALVIC FLOOR AND SO THIS CAN LEAD TO ISSUES LET START WITH EURANATION YOU CAN HAVE SYMPTOMS OF URGENCY FREQUENCY A MEANING IF TO GO A LOT TO THE BATHEM OR YOU HAVE TO GO AND HAVE A SUDDEN DESIRE THAT YOU CAN'T DELAY SOMETIMES EVEN HAVE LEAGAGE IN SOME CASES IT CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO URINATE BECAUSE THE PAVIC FLOOR IS SO TENSE OR PERHAPS TO INCOMPLETELY VACATE THE BLATTER CORRECTLY YOU GO TO URINATE AND THEN YOU GO BACK TO YOUR DASCUR AND FIVE MINUTE LATER YAFTER URINATE AGAIN EXACTLY SOMETHING OF OTSALL IT CAN BE EITHER THAT YOU'RE NOT APTING COMPLITLY OR THAT THE PAVIC FOR MUSCLES ARE SO TENSE THAT THEIR STIMULAING THE BLATAR SO IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S MORE TO GO SO'S NOT ALWAYS THAT YOU'RE NOT EVACUATING IT IT CAN PRESENT IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEN WITH A WITH SEXUAL FUNCTION IT IF ITS VERY TENSE YOU CAN HAVE PAIN SO YOU CAN HAVE PAIN WITH SEX YOU CAN HAVE PAIN WITH ERECTIONS YOU CAN HAVE PAIN WITH EJACULATION SOMETIMES TIT CAN BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT KIND OF PAIN CYNDRUMS AND YOU'RE LIKE I HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON N IT'S REALLY JUST PALVIC FLOORIDAS FUNCTION A WITH WITH GI FUNCTION YOU CAN DEATHLY HAVE CONSTIPATION AND THEN OFTEN YOU CAN ALSO HAVE BACK PAIN A AND SO ALL F THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOUR PALVIC FLOOR IS TO TENSE SOMETIMES YOUR PUBLIC FLOOR CAN BE TO WEAK AND THAT CAN BE OFTEN BECAUSE OF WE SEE THIS IN WOMEN A LOT BECAUSE OF CHILD BIRTH DELIVERING CHILDREN A WITH SOME PEOPLE OF NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS THEY CAN HAVE WEAK PALVIC FLOORS AR CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS LIKE LERS DAMWELL SYNTUM FOR EXAMPLE THESE SORTS OF THINGS CAN CAUSE WEAKNESS TO THE PALVIC FLOOR WHICH CAN THEN CAUSE VERY OFTEN WHAT I SEE LIKE EORINARIAN CONTINENTS AR LEAKAGE A WHICH CAN BEN NO CREATE PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE DOWN THE LINE THANK YOU FOR THAT SO FIRST QUESTION HOW DOES SOMEBODY KNOW IF THEIR PELVIC FLOOR IS TOO TIGHT FROM A A OVER CONTRACTION OR CHRONIC CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES THEIR VERSES TOO WEAK AM AN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IS THAT IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CONTRACTION OF THE CALF MUSCLE OR THE BISEP I THINK EVERYONE INTUITIVELY KNOWS BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN THE SHORTENING OF THE MUSCLES WHEN THE MUSCLES QUITIT FLEXED AND THE LENGTHENING OF THE MUSCLES WHEN IT IS RELAXED A IS THERE A WAY TO DESCRIBE PELVIC FLOOR MUSCULAR SHORTENING IN A WAY THAT EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND WOULD THIS BE LIKE A LIKE A SO WE'RE GIN TO BE DIRECT TO DAY WOULD THIS LIKE BE LE TENSING UP ONE'S AM A ANIS AN BOUT THE OPPOSITE OF OF THE MOVEMENT THAT ONE WOULD DO BEFORE INITIATING A BOWLE MOVEMENT AND RELAXATION IS SORT OF THE PATTERN OF PLVIC FLOOR MUSCULAR AM RELAXATION JUST PRIOR TO INITIATING ABOWLE MOVEMENT SO I WILL SHEY MOST PEOPLE CAN'T RECOGNIZE IT BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO NOTICE IT SORT OF A GRADUAL AND SO IT CAN OVER TIME BECOME NOTICEABLE WITH THESE SYMPTOMS BUT OTHERWISE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MUSCLE THAT WE WERE EVER TRAIN TO RECOGNIZES RIGHT LIKE YOU HEAR ABOUT KEEGAL EXERCISES FOR EXAMPLE AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW TO DO THEM BUT THAT'S ALL YOU EVER HEAR ABOUT THE PALVIC FLOOR AND SO YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO KIND OF DO THINGS IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS YOUR PALVIC FLOOR OR A OR KIND OF WHAT HOW DO EVEN TELL WHEN IT'S TOO TIGHT OR NOT RELAXING AND SO THAT TAKES THE SORT OF A TRAINING AND SO USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE COME TO FORSE AGET AN EXAMINATION TO SEE IF YOUR PALVIC FLOORAS TIGHT TO FOR WOMEN AT THE PALVIC EXAMINED FOR MEN AS USUALLY ERECTA EXAM HOW DOS HOW DOES THAT EXAM GO SO YOU KNOW IT'S ESSENTIALLY PALPATING THE MUSCLES AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE FUNCTION SO WELL SAY FOR A DIGITAL PALPATION WOULE THAT'S A MEDICAL TACKNOWLEDGY FOR FINGERS ARE CALLED DIGITS A SO AM YOU KNOW I'M OLD ENOUGH TO AT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT A DIGITAL PROSTRATE EXAM IS RIGHT THE PHYSICIAN INSEARCS THEIR FINGERS THROUGH INTO THE ANICINE AND AND FEELS THE PROSTRATE TO SEE WHETHER NOT AT SWOLLEN OR NOT AND AND AS OM SAING THES I'M REALIZ IN AS SONN AS WE THINK OF MET MEDICINE CONIQUA MODERN MEDICINE SO EVOLVED THIS IS BASIL BASICALLY BEEN THE PRACTICE OR WHAT FIFTY YEAR SIXTY YEARS MAY BE A HUNDRED YEARS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE THE OLD SCHOOL PRACTICE FOR GLAUCOMA THUS OF IE PRESSURE WATS FOR THE PHYSICIAN WO JUST TOUCH THE EYEBALL SO O FOLKS FOR THOSE DO YOUT THINK THAT MEDICINE HAS EVOLVED MUCH A IT CLEARLY HAS IN MANY WAYS BUT UMIN ANY EVENT SO A PROSTRATE EXAM THOSAS I JUST DESCRIBED WHAT WOULD A WHAT WOULD A PELVIC FLOR EXAM FOR A MALE AND A PUVIC FLOOR EXAMPHER A FEMALE A INVOLVE AT A CONT OF GRANULAR LEVEL YES SO FOR FOR WOMEN YOU CAN FEEL THE PALIC FLOR MUSCLES THROUGH THE VIGINA SO YOU CAN FEEL THE ELIO COXAGES THE PUBOCOXAGES THE LEVATE OR AIT AN THOSE ARE ALL NAMES OF DIFFERENT MUSCLES IN THIS BULL IS IS N A PHYSITION WHO CAN FEEL THE CRAR FINGERS AND YOUKNO YOU COULD DOO YOU COULD PUT YOUR FINGER BUT YOU TO HAVE A REFERENCE OF NORMAL RIGHT SO YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT A NORMAL PALVIC FLOOR FEELS LIKE VERSES THA TIGHT ONE VERSES A WEAK ONE AND SO YOU CAN ASSASS THE TENSENESS BASE ON OUNO PALPATION YOU CAN ALSO SEE IF THERE'S TENDERNESS AND SO YOU CAN ASSASS THAT BASE ON JUST AT A GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND THEN ALSO YOU CAN OBSERVE SO I CAN SAY CONTRACT YOUR BY SQUEEZE YOUR PALVIC FLOOR UP AND AND I CAN LOOK AND SEE ARE THEY SQUEEZING OR ARE THEY PUSHING  ARE THEY COORDINATED OR NOT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE A FUNCTION OF NORMAL YOUSE OF THE PALVIC FLOOR ANCD SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE THAT THEIRE DISCOORDINATED AM YOU CAN ALSO ASSASS FIR SENSATION IN THE ARIAN THINGS THAT THAT THAT COULD BE CONSEQUENCES OF DISFUNCTION TO THERE BE DISFUNCTION AN LATERALITY LIKE THE PELIN FORS PULLING UP INTO THE RIT OR UP IN TO THE LEFT ABSOLUTELY SO WHAT TIPICALLY WHEN YOU SEE A PAVIC FLORTHARIPIS NOT NOT OF PAVIC FLORTHERIPIS BUT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK RIGHT THEY THEY WORK WITH YOU ON A PROLONG BASIS TO HELP YOU NORMALIZE THE FUNCTION OF YOUR PAVIC FLORITS LIKE GORN THE GIM WITH THE TRAIN ARE RIGHT THEY REALLY WORK WITH YOU TO GET YOUR PAIC FLOOR FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY AND THE FIRST STEP TO THAT A LOTOC PAVIC FLORTHARIPIS WILL JUST A LINE YOUR BONES AND AND YOUR YOUR KIND OF THE WAY YOU SIT AND WALK TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT STRAINING THOSE MUSCLES BY PULLING IN DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND IF A MAIL GOES TO THE PHYSICIAN TO GET A PELVIC FLOOR EXAM UM THERE'S OBVIOUSLY UM A DIFFICULTY IN PUTTING FINGERS INTO THE RETHRA ONE WOULD HOP A TOO SMALL AND OPENING SO HOW ARE THEY DOING THE PELVIC FLOR EXAMINES IT EXTERNAL TO THE BADIERS IT THROUGH THE ANAS SO SOME OF ITS THROUGH THE ANES YOU CAN FEEL THE MUSCLES THROUGH THE ANAS THAN YOU CAN FEEL THE PARANEAL ARIAD FILL THE MUSCLES THERE AS WELL SENSATIONS SOA SUPERNEAL AREA SO FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BAI TOC AM THE REAGION BETWEEN THE SCROTOM AND THE ANAS YES OK SO IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE IF PEOPLE WANT TO GET A HIGH QUALITY ASSESTIMENT OF WHETHER NOTHER PELVIC FLOOR IS HEALTHY OR NOT THEY NEAN TO SEE A PUVIC FLOR SPECIALIST YET THAT ITS NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT THEY COULD INTO ON THEIR OWN NECESSARILY IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT I MEAN SO THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN BUY ON LINE LIKE PROBES THAT YOU CAN INSERT AN THE VIGINA THAT WILL TEACH WHAT A DO KEEGAL EXERCISES AND GIVE YOU SOME READ I OF SOME READINGS BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY MEANT TO DIAGNO TEYUSUALY SOMETHING PEOPLE USE IF THEY THEY HAVE A WEAK PALVIC FLOOR AND THEY WANT TO TRY TO DO IT AT HOME ON THEIR OWN ALSO THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN TO GIVE YOU LIKE A BASELINE READING IS THIS NORMAL OR ABNORMAL BUT' TALK ABOUT KEAGLES UM FOR SMALL WHOSE KEAGLE SO HE IS A A GINA COLLEGISTS I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE SPECIFICS TO BE QUIANAS BUT BASICALLY HE CAME UP WITH KEAGLES WHICH ARE A STRENGTHENING EXERCISE FOR THE PALVIC FLOOR AND SO WHAT IT IS WHAT WE DESCRIBE IT TO FOR PATIENCE AS WE SAY YOU'RE GOING TO THERE'S FRE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DESCRIBE IT YOU'RE GOING TO YOUSE THE MUSCLES THAT USE WHEN YOU YEARNIT BUT TRY TO STOP THE FLOW BUT YOU DON'T DO THE WHON YOU'RE YEARNATING CAUSE THAT CAN CREATE DISFUNCTION YOU HAN TO LEARN WHAT THE MUSCLES ARE AND THEN YOU SQUEEZE THOSE MUSCLES AND RELAX YOU KNOW IN BETWEEN SETS SO SO TO SPEAK AND SO YOU'LL DO THE OTHER WAY PEOPLE DESCRIBE IT IS PULLING UP AND IN IN THE LIGEF VIGINA OR FOR MEN SAN OA YOU SAY ITS LIKE THE FEELING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LIFT YOUR PENUS OFF THE FLOOR WITHOUT TOUCHING IT RIGHT SO THOSE ARE KIND OF YEAER O DESCRIBE IT SO THOSE ARE KIND OF OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN DESCRIBE THOSE MUSCLES AND SO YOU CAN SQUEEZE FOR FIVE SECONDS AND RELAX FOR FIVE SECONDS AND DO THEM IN REPETITIONS AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE ANY SORT OF EXERCISE YOU DO YOU DON'T WANT TO START DOING A HUNDRED OF THEM RIGHT YOU ON A DO THEM I SHELL THET PEOPLE I TELL PATIENTS YROU THEM LYING DOWN SO THAT YOU'RE ONLY FOCUSSHING ON THOSE MUSCLES YOU NOT WORKING ON YOUR POSTURE YOURE NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE AND AS YOU GET BETTER WITH THEM LYING DOWN YOU THEN SIT UP AND DO THEM AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE GOOD WITH THEM SITTING NOP YOU CAN DO THEM STANDING AND START WITH YOU DON'T TEN OF FIFTEEN AT A TIME LIKINE OA MARNETINE REPETITION TO YO TE ONC TATS OYE SO YET TEN OF FIFTEEN REPETITIONS IN THE MORNING TEND TO FIFTEEN REPETITIONS AT NIGHT A MAYBE ONE MORE DURING THE MIDDLE THE DAY BUT DON'T OVERDO IT BECAUSE JUST LIKE ANYTHING ESPECIALY WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT YOU CAN AND IF YOU'RE DOING TONS AND TONS IC KEAGLES THEN YOU WILL GET A TIGHT SHORT PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES AND YOU WILL THEN DEVELOP PELVIC FLOORIDOUS FUNCTIONS SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND THOSE MECHANICS WHICH IS WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW HOW TO DO KEAGLES BUT THEY REALLY DON'T AND SO I ALWAYS INCORRAGE ILE IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND THE RESOURCES TO GO TO A PEVIC FLOOR PHYSICAL THERAPIT SO THEY CAN REALLY WORK WITH YOU AND MAKE SURE YOUR DOING THEM CORRECTLY WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF EAGLES FOR THOSE THAT NEED THEM YES SO THEY ARE TYPICALLY PRESCRIBED FOR YOUR INARRING CONTINENTS SPECIFICALLY STRESS YOUR INEARING CONTNENTS SO LEAGAGE THAT OCCURS WHEN YOU HAVE INCREASE IN YOUR INTRABDOMINAL PRESSURE LIKE A VALSALVA OR COUGHING SNEEZING LIFTING HEAVY THINGS JUMPING ON A TRAMPALINE A SO FOR THOSE PURPOSES WE USE KEAGLES TO STRENGTHEN THE PALVIC FLOOR AND ALSO AN WOMEN PALVIC ORGAN POLAPSE SO WHEN YOU HAVE WEAKNESS OF THE PAVIC FLOOR THAT LEADS TO A BULGE THAT YOU CAN VISIBLY SEE OR FEEL IN THE VIGINA FOR MEN WE OFTEN PRESCRIBE THEM FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A PROSSATAC TO ME WHO THEN SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOP LEAGAGE AFTER THE PROCETACT ME THAT IS AGAINST TRESS HERINERING CONTENENCE NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE USE KEAGLES RECREATIONALLY BECAUSE IMPROVING THE PAIC FLOOR MUSCULATURE CAN LEAD TO MORE INTENSE PALVIC FLOOR CONTRACTIONS DURING ORGASM WHICH CAN BE MORE PLEASURABLE AND SO SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THOSE PURPOSES BUT AGAIN I CAUTION PEOPLE NOT TO OVERDO IT A BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN LEAD TO A MORE TENS PALVIC FLOOR WHICH IS NOT WHERE WE WANTO END UP YES I WILL UNDER SCORE A THAT CAUTIONARY NOTE YEARS AGO I HEARD ABOUT KEAGLES SI COGILL TRY IT SOUNDS ALL GOOD RIGHT I ONLY HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT KEAGLES AM AND WHAT QUICKLY RESULTED IN WAS PAINFUL URINATION AND I THOUGHT THIS IS WEIRD EVERYONE SAYIND KEAGLES ARE SO GREAT UM AND THE BEST THING I COULD DO FOR MY PALIC FLOOR T SEEMED WAS TO AVOID KEAGLES YES AUM AND LOBIT LATER ALL WHEN WERE TALK ABOUT PROSTRATE II'LL EXPLAIN UM AT LEAST WHAT MY EXPERIENCE WAS AS IT RELATES TO THE PROSTRATE UM BUT I GUESS THE TAKO MESSAGE THAT I'M GATHERING FROM WHAT YOUR TLLING US IYS THAT STRENGTHENING THE PELIC FLOOR IS GREAT IF YOU HAVE A WEAK PALVIC FLOOR STRENGTHENING YOUR PEUIC FLOOR FURTHER IF YOU HAVE A STRONG PELVIC FLOOR CAN BE DETRIMENTAL IT CAN BE IT CAN BE AS IF YOU OVERTRAIN IT JUST LIKE IF YOU OVERTRAIN ANYTHING ELSE AND SO A YOU JUST HAVE TO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO KEAGLES IF YOU HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS AT ALL LIKE YOU DESCRIBED PAINFUL EURANATION OR THE THINGS I'VE DESCRIBE LIKE PAIN WITH ERECTIONS PAIN WITH A G ACULATION PAIN A DIFFICULTY EMPTYING ANY OF THOSE SYMPTOMS STOP AND GO SEE A YEUROLOGIST SO THAT THEY CAN KIND OF ASSESSIOR PAVIC FLOOR WHAT IS THE ANTIKEYGL IN OTHER WORDS IF SOMEBODY DECIDES THAT THEY HAVE A TIGHT PLVIC FLOOR HOW CAN THEY LEARN TO RELAX THEIR PELVIC FLOOR SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SORT OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO SO FUR A WOMEN YOU CAN DO MESAGE OF THE AREA YOU CAN USE VAGIONAL DILATORS TO HELP RELAX HEN MUSCLES YOU CAN TAKE SEPOSITORIES THAT HAVE MEDICATIONS LIKE VALIUM OR BACKLEFEN WHICH ARE MUSCLE RELAXENTS AND A THAT CAN HELP AS WELL ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT TREATMENTS THER MORE OF ABANDAED BUT THEY CAN HELP WITH THE SYMPTOMS THAT YOU'RE HAVING AND THEN A YOU CAN ALSO I THINK THE BEST THING IS TO WORK WITH THE PHYSICAL THERPIS CAUSE THEY CAN TEACH YOU CERTAIN EXERCISES THAT WILL HELP DOWN TRAIN THE PALVIC FLOOR FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE ONES I TELL MY PATIENTS IS LIKE HAPPY BABY POIS IT ACTUALLY ENOUSTRATCHES AND ELONGATES THE PALVIC FLAR MUSCLES SO DOING THESE EXERCISES REGULARLY WILL HELP YOU LENGTHEN THE PALPIC FLAR MUSCLES ONE THING THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED EXTREME PAINFROM AND THAT STOPPING WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED FOR MY PELVIC FLOOR WAS TO NOT DO ANY KIND OF CRUNCHING MOVEMENT WITH MY LEGS CROSSED I WOULD GO THESE YOG OF CLASSES ONE IN MY LIFE AND I THEY'D HAVE EVRYBODY O THESE CRUNCHES AND I'VE ALWAYS DONE SOME ABDOMINAL WORK HERE AND THERE DURING THE WEEK IF I'M BEING DILIGENT BUT THEY WOULD HAVE US CROSS OUR FEET AND THAT SEEM TO LEAD TO SOME PALVIC FLOOR DISCOMFORT THAT WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT IAD EXPERIENCED WHEN I DID THE KEYGLES YESO GAINT FOR ME SEESING TE KEYGOLES WAS ONE OF THE BEST ASSITIONS I EVER MADE I ONLY DO THEM FOR A SHORT WHILES I GET THIS IS CLEARLY NOT FOR MADE AND I GESS THAT'S ANOTHER POINT I'M THAT TELL ME IF YOU AGREE WERE NOT THAT IF YOU HEAR ABOUT SOMETHING ON LINE OR ON THIS PODCAST OR ANYWHERE ELSE AND YOU TRIED AND IT SEEMS TO BE SENDING THINGS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION EITHER YOU'RE DOING IT WRONGER IT MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU EXACTLY AN I THINK ALL TOO OFTEN WE HEAR THIS THING IS GREAT AND PEOPLE JUMP ON THAT BAN WAGON AND THAN THEY AN UP WORSENING THEI PROLMIS OR DEVELOPING PROLMISE WERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEM PREVIOUSLY BUT IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE ANATOMY OF THE NERMUSCULAR CONNEXTIONS OR ORE VASCULATURE OF THE PALVI FLOOR THAT WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR MY EXPERIENCE THER THAT DOING CRUNCHES WITH LEGS CROSSES ESSENTIALLY  IS IT POSSIBLE THAT'S CREATING A SYMETRIES ON THE PELVIC FLOOR UM AND NOW I'M SURE I'M  ANGRY YOGATEACHERS AND UMC CRUNCHA CRUNCHIN EAS STOS EVERYWHERE BUT YOU KNOW HEH UM IF IT'S THE QUESTION OF YOUR PLVIC FLOOR OF FOU EXTRA UMDELINEATIONS IN YOUR ABS YOU KNOW WHERE MY VOTES GOING SO THERE'S THE COUPLE THINGS HERE THAT WE SHOULD DIVE INTO ONE IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN BREATHE CORRECTLY DURING EXERCISE RA AND SO DIAPHERMATIC BREATHING IS IS REALLY IMPORNT WHICH IS LIKE A DEEP BREATH THAT EXPANDS THE DIA FRAM NOT KIND OF SHALO BRATING THAT JUST IN YOUR MOUTH AND THROW AND THAT IS ACTUALLY WHEN YOU TYOU NOW WHEN YOU DO ANY SORT OF EXERCISE THE YOUR TRAINER WILL TELL YOU EXHALE ON THE EFFORT RIGHT AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU INHALE YOUR PALVIC FLOOR RELAXES WHEN YOU EXHALE YOUR PALVIC FLOOR CONTRACTS AND SO IT ACTUALLY THAT CONTRACTION STABLIZES THE PALVIC FLORSA WHATEVER INTRABDOMINAL PRESSURE YOUR YOUR CAUSING TO INCREASE FROM THE EXERCISE WHETHER IT'S A SQUAT OR AS CRUNCH OR WHATEVER YOUR INCREASING YOUR ABDOMINAL PRESSURE YOUR PALIC FLOOR IS THEN CONTRACTING TO HELP STABLIZE THAT AND SO PART PART OF THE REASON PEOPLE TEND TO HOLD THEIR BREATH DURING CRUNCHES RIGHT THEY DON'T DO THE APPROPRIATE BREATHING AND SO THAT CAN BE PART OF IT THE OTHER THING THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH CERTAIN THINGS IS THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW NERVES AND ARRIES PARTICULARLY THE PEDENDAL NERVE AND THE PEDENTAL ARTERY THAT RUN THROUGH THE PALVIC FLOOR SO WHEN YOU GET PALVIC FLOORIDOUS FUNCTION YOU CAN CAUSE DECREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE TO THE PALVIC FLOOR MUSCLES WHICH CAN AFFACTSECTUAL FUNCTION AND YOU CAN GET NERVE INFLAMMATION AS WELL THAT CAN ALL THEYLL CAUSE PAIN AND THELL THEY THE KIND OF HALIDILL COMES TOGETHER SO GLAD HT YOU MENTION BLOOD FLOW I THINK OUR ENTIRE DISCUSSION TO DAY SHOULD BE FRAMED UP AT LEAST IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS IN THE MINDS OF OUR LISTENERS AN VEWERS AS INVOLVING AT LEAST THREE THINGS ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABUT ERECTILE FUNCTION OR DISFUNCTION OR PELVIC FLOR FUNCTIONOR DISFUNCTION OR VAGINAL LUBRICATION OR LACK THEREOF WE NEEDTO THINK ABOUT THE HORMONAL INFLUENCES THE BLOOD FLOW RELATED INFLUENCES AND THE NURL INFLUENCES INCLUDING THE NURL INFLUENCES THAT COME FROM THE BRAIN THE SIGNALS OF AROWZLE FOR INSTANCE ORE LACK OF ARALSAL TAM AND SO ON SO AM WE WON'T BE OVERLY SYSTEMATIC IN IN OUR A PARSING OF ALL THIS BUT I I THINK WHAT YOU JUST MENTION RAISES REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THAT SOMETIMES IN AN EFFORT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR THE MUSCLES LIKE STRENGTH IN THE MUSCLES ONE WILL CUT OFF BLOOD FLOW IN FACT ONE OF THE MORE COMMON QUESTIONS I GOT AND I CONSULTED WITH A COUPLE OF EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGISTS ABOUT THIS AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SQUAT AND DEAD LIFT HEAVY IN THE GIM OR EVEN WHO JUST TENCE THEIR PELVIC FLOOR WHEN THEY'RE DOING THINGS LIKE DUMBELL CURLS WERE OTHER EXERCISES AND ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO DO A LOT OF ABDOMINAL WORK REPORTED TO ME IN THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY EXPERIENCE THINGS LIKE ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION THAT THEY EXPERIENCE THINGS LIKE PANGERING VASINAL INTERCOURSE THAT ESSENTIALLY THEY HAD CREATED SOME SORT OF SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A HYPER CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES IN THAT AREA THAT WERE IMPEDING ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY WANTED AS EITHER SIDE EFFECTS ARE DIRECT EFFECTS OF EXERCISE BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ARE EXERCISING FOR STHETIC REASONS AND HEALTH REASONS BUT NOWADAYS IT SEEMS ESPECIALLY ON THE MALE SIDE BUT WE ALL STRUCK ABO THEIR OLD TESTOSTER ON THE FEMALE SIDE A LOT OF MALES LIFT WAIGHTS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR TESTOSTERONE AND FOR REASONS THAT ARE OBVIOUS ALSO WANT HAVE HEALTHY SEXUAL FUNCTION AND HERE THEY ARE DOING THIS THING THAT'S VERY GOOD FOR INCREASING TESTOSTRONE IF THEY'R DOING IT CORRECTLY AND TOSTOSTRONE IS INVOLVED IN LIBIDO IN THE MALE SEXUAL RESPONSE END THE FEMALE SEXUAL RESPONSE OF COURSE BUT THEY ARE IMPEDING THEIR ERECTIONS SO YOU CAN START TO SEE HOW A THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF CONFUSED AND MAY BEVEN DISTRAUGHT PEOPLE OUT THERE THEY'RE TRYING TO DO ALL THE RIGHT THINGS AND THEI'RE SETTING UP RODE BLOCKS AND EVEN A SENDING THEMSELVES BACKWARD IN SOME CASES SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES ONE KNOW WHETHER NOT SOMETHING LIKE A LET'S A LOW LUBRICATION OR PAINDURING VAGUNAL INTERCOURSE OR A LOSS OF RECTILE STRENGTH OR SOME SORT OF ERECTILE DISFUNCTION WHATEVER IT MAY BE CAUSE IT CAN TAKE ON DIFFERENT FORMS AS WILL TALK ABOUT HOW DOES ONE KNOW IF IT'S BLOOD FLOW RELATED HORNMONE RELATED OR NURAL RELATED AND IF IT'S NOR RELATED HOW DOES ONE KNOW OF IT'S ISSUE OF LACK OF APPROPRIATE SIGNALS FROM THE BRAIN OVER SUPPRESSION OR LACK OF O ROUSAL FROM THE BRAIN OR WHETHER NOT AT SOME PARIFERAL NERAL THING OF ENERVATION OF THE PINA ERVIGIN SO I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN GO INTO HERE BUT ESECTUALLY FIRST YOU ONE TO FIND OUT LIKE VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS GOING ON ARE YOU GETTING AROUSED ARE YOU HAVING ARECTIONS ARE YOU MASTERBATING LIKE THERE'S ALL THESE QUESTIONS THAT WILL HELP US GO DOWN THEROSE SORRITO INTERRUP WHEN YOU SAY AROUSED A FORSAKE IN THIS DISCUSSION I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGICAL AROUSAL THE DESIRE TO DO A I GUESS HERE WE ALSO HAVE TO BE PRECISE A AROUSAL TO ENGAGING INTERCORSING AROUSAL TO A DESIRE ESSENTIALLY ERI THINK PEOPLE LEARN TORECOGNIZE OR WE TALKING ABOUT A ROUSAL AS THE RESPONSE OF THE GANITALS CORRECT O SO DESIRE AND AROUSAL THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONCAPT DOESN'T ALWAYS GO IN ONE DIRECTION SOMETIMES YOU CAN FEEL AROUSAL MEANING YOU HAVE THE TELL TALL SIENS OF AROUSAL YOUR NIPPLES GET E RECT YOU HAVE MORE LUBRECATION IF YOU'RE A FEMALE YOU REALLY MAL WHEN FOU MAL NIPPLES GET ERECTOR IN ER RO BELIEVE SOMETHINK SO NO SO A YOU KNOW YOU MAYBE GET THE SEX FLUSH WHET YOU GET SOME SOME REDNESS OR OR WARMTH FEELING THAT'S YOUR BODY'S RESPONSE WRITE TO AROUSAL AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE AN ERECTION AND SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT NOT HAVING AN ERECTION DOES NOT MEAN YOU'RE NOT AROUSED IT MAY MEAN OTHER THINGS BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S PART OF IT AND THEN DESIRE DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX DO YOU HAVE DELIC WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR PARTNER OR WHO WHOEVER YOU WANT TO ENGAGE WITH TO  THEIR DESIRE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT RIGHT OR RES IT JUST MORE OF OBLIGATION OR OTHER THINGS AND DOESN IT DESIRE IT DOESN'T MATTER F THE DESIRE COMES AFTER AROUSAL FOR SOME WOMEN IN PARTICULAR WE SEE THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE DESIRE RIGHT AWAY BUT THEY WANT TO BE INTIMATE OR CLOSE WITH THEIR PARTNER AND SO THEY'LL START JUST BEING CLOSE WITH THEM AND THEN AROUSAL WILL COME AND THEN OH YE YOU KNOW I'D LIKE THIS SO THEN THE DESIRE COMES AFTER AND THAT'S NORMAL THAT'S TOTALLY FINE ANSO YOU WANT A KIND OF PART THAT OUT AND THEN FOR MEN YOU CAN ASK ARE YOU GETTING ERECTIONS AT NIGHT BECAUSE THAT WILL TELL US THE FUNCTION OF YOUR ORGAN AT NIGHT VERSES DURING THE DAY WHERE YOU HAVE ALSO PSYCHOGENIC COMPONENTS RIGHT YOU CAN REALLY GET IN YOUR HEAD ABOUT ERECTIONS WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IN THE BEDROOM WITH PERFORMANCE IT BECOMES A VICIOUS PCYCLE RITE SO YOU YOU HAVE A PROBLEM THE NEXT TIME YOUR REALLY STREST YOU'RE NOT PRESENT YOU'RE NOT MINDFUL IN THE MOMENT WITH SEX AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ON MA GOT A MEGANA PERFORM OC A MIGAT A PERFORMO  AND THEN IT DOESN'T PERFORM AGAIN AND YOUR JUST IT'S GETTING WORSE AND WORSE THE ANXIETY IS THROUGH THE ROOF AND THAT'S ACTUALLY CAUSING YOUR SEXUAL DISFUNCTION SO I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FIRST TO IDENTIFY THOSE ISSUES AND THEN ALSO FOR A BLOODFLOW A LOVETIMES WE CAN WE CAN ASSASS PASED ON WELL WHAT OTHER COMORBITIES DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE OTHER ISSUES ON GOING THAT MAY BE AFFECTING YOUR BLOODFLOW MOST COMMON HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIBETIS HEART DISEASE AND IF YOU SMOKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL EFFECT BLOOD FLOW TO THE GENITALS AND SO THAT WILL POINT TETIVE NEGATIVELY NEGATIVELY SO SO THAT WILL POINT US TO A MORE VASCULAR ISSUE HORMONAL ISSUES ARE ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR DESIRE AND AND YOU KNOW AS FAR AS SEXUAL FUNCTION IN TERMS OF ERECTIONS THERE'S ONLY THREE PER CENT OF ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION IS RELATED TO HORMONES SO IT' TACT DOES WONDER A RECTAL FUNCTION CORRECT AS OPPOSED TO DESIRE GRESSIAS WIRE IT ISDESIRE IS PREDOMINANTLY MODULATED BY THE HORMONTOSTOSTROM FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IN FACT IF YOU A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT WOMEN HAVE MORE TESTASTRONE IN THEIR BODIES AN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE ASTRAGENT SO TOSAFTOMS VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN FOR VARIETY OF REASONS AND SO YOU OUNA USING THAT DISCUSSION WITH THE PATIENT WILL HELP YOU KIND OF IDENTIFY WEARE YOUR HEADED IN TERMS OF A WHAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON FOR TREATMENT THERE ARE YOU KNOW CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN USE TO ASSESS BLOOD FLOW YOU CAN DO DOPLER ULTRASOUNDS OF THE PENUS AS WELL AS THE CLITERIST TO SEE IF THERE IS GOOD BLOOD FLOW YOU CAN ASSESS THE PEQSOSTOLIC VELACITY WHICH WILL TELL YOU IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH ARE TUL INFLOW VERSES THE END DIOSTOLIC VELACITY WHICH WILL TELL YOU IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH VENUS OUTFLOW AND SO THAT CAN ASSESS THOSE THINGS THERE ARE SOME TUSS YOU CAN DO FOR NERVE FUNCTION ALTHOUGH THEIR VERY UNCOMMONLY DONE BECAUSE MOSTLY W E CAN KIND WHO GET THAT THROUGH CLINICAL REPORT AND UNFORTUNATELY IF YOUR HAVING NERVE POBS SUMETIMES IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S CAUSING THEM BUT SOMETHIMES THEY CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REVERSE AND THAT'S KIND OF A PROBLEM WE KNOW THAT AS PEOPLE AGE THEIR SENSATION BECOMES LESS SO JUST THROUGH AGING THE NERVES THE RECEPTORS BECOME LESS SENSITIVE AND SO YOU WILL GENERALLY HAVE LESS RERESPONSIVENESS TO THE SAME SENSATIONS YOU DID WHEN YOU ARE YOUNGER AND SO THAT CAN HAVE OVERLAYS ALL OF THIS SO IT'S COMPLEX BUT REALLY IU KNO A LOT OF IT COMES FROM THE DISCUSSION YOU HAVE WITH YOUR PATIENT OR YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF REALLY DOING A DEEP AVE IN WHAT'S GOING ON LIKE REALLY THINKING ABOUT EACH OF THOSE ASPECTS AND ALSO WHAT'S GOING ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN EAN OF YOUR LIFE STRAS TANGSIETY THE COWARE THOS IS A THING RO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING A G ONE DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEY'RE SPONSORING THE POD CAST A G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT'S DESIGNED TO ME ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS OF COURSE I TRY TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF VITEMENS AND MINERALS THROUGH WHOLE FOOD SOURCES THAT INCLUDE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS EVERY DAY BUT OFTENTIMES I SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH SERVINGS BUT WITH A G ONE I'M SURE TO GET ENOUGH VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED END IT ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTAGENCE TO HELP BUFFER STRESS SIMPLY PUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I TAKE  G ONE I HAVE MORE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND I SLEEP BETTER AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO TASTE RIGHT FOR ALL THESE REASONS WHENEVER I'M ASKED IF YOU COULD TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT WOULD IT BE I ANSWER A G ONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY AG ONE THEY'LL TO DRINK  G ONE DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEM IN D THREE K TO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DO COM SLASH HUBERMEN GUSH LOTS THERE TO ADPACK EM AND I'M GLAD YOU MENTION THE RELATIONSHIP ITSELF BECAUSE IM THERE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT CAN IMPACT THE ARE ALSIL RESPONSE A NOVELTY I'MNOT EVERYONE'S IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP UM WHETHE'RE NOT PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING IN A LOT OF ASTURBATION TO THE POINT OF EJACULATION OR CLIMAX OR NOT EM FORNOGRAPHY ET CETERA WEWE WILL GET INTO THAT A IT'S A VAST SPACE TO EXPLORE BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I WANT TO MAKE SURE HOWEVER THAT WE CU PEOPLE TO WHERE AND HOW THEY COULD FIND A REALLY GOOD LET'S A PELVIC FLOOR A THERAPIST UM AND WHERE THEY COULD FIND A REALLY GREAT EUROLOGIST TO DO THE SORTS OF EXAMS AND PERHAPS THE SORTS OF TREATMENTS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE EM AT LEAST AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND MUCH OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN ON THIS POD CASS IS HOW THINGS WORK AND WHAT HAPPENS ONE THINGS S BREAK DOWN BUT ALSO AW TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES SO LET SAY SOMEBODY WANTS TO UM CHECK OUT THEIR PALVIC FLOOR FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE MAYBE THERE HAVING ISSUES MAY BE THERE NOT  IF THEY ARE MALE OR FEMALE WHERE DO THEY GO WTIS THEIR PLACE ON LINE THAT HAS A GREAT LIST OF OF SOME OF THE BEST ONES ONE'S ARIA CAN BE DONE OVER TELLA MEDICONE UM NO HOWHAS ONE GO ABOUT THAT YET SO IN TERMS OF YOUR PALVIC FLOOR IT'S GOOD TO GET ASSESSED BY A PHYSICIAN WHO SPECIALIZES PLVIC FLOOR D NOW THAT COULD BE A EUROLOGIST THAT COULD BE A YNACHOLOGIST OR EVEN A PHYSICAL MEDICINE N REHABILITATION DOCTOR THAT SPECIALIZES IN PALVIC FLOOR HEALTH SO TYPICALLY YOU'LL SEE A IN EUROLOGY YOU LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BORED CERTIFIED IN FEMALE PALVIC MEDICINE AN RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY IF YOU'RE WOMAN IF YOU'RE MAN MAY BE SEXUAL MEDICINE A SOME ONE WHO SPECIALIZE IN SEXUAL MEDICINE WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO LOOK FOR GINA CALL JUST A GANUINE LOOK AT SOME ONE WHO HAS INTEREST IN THIS AREA WHO AENO DOES MANAGE PALVIC FLOOR AND THEN IN TERMS OF PALVIC FLOOR A PHYSICAL MESONREABILITATION AT LEAST WHEN I WAS IN TRAYING THERE IS ABOUT TWENTY PIUMIN IR DOCTORS AREOUN THE COUNTRY WHO REALLY FOCUST ON THIS SO IT'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOU CAN GO TO A PALVIC FLOOR PHYSICAL HERAPIS AND YOU HAVE ONE NEAR YOU THAT'S GREAT AS WELL YOU A YOU DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE MAY DO ARE CERTIFIED IN PAVIC FLOOR PHYSICAL THERAPY AND THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF YOUR GENDER SO IF YOU HAVE MALE ANATOMY THAT YOU WANT TO GO TO SOMEONE WHOS ACTUALLY SEEN MEN BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PAVIC FLOOR PHYSICAL THERAPIST TEND TO TREAT A LOT OF WOMEN AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I TELL MY PATIENTS GENERALY SPEAKING THERE'S NO TLEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO GREAT RESOURCEINE MAY BE WILL WILL LOOK THAT UP IN SAFELY AND FINE ONE THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU AND BECAUSE IT AGAIN GOING BACK TO WHAT I SAID THE BEGINNING OF OUR CONVERSATION THINK THERE'S A LOT OF NO SHAME OR AT LEAST LACK OF CLARITY IS TO HOW ONE GETS HELP FOR ISSUES THAT A RELATE TO THE GENITALS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A HEADACRE YOU HAVING AND I ISSUE AN OR NOWHERE TO GO YEM OFULLY YOU'RE HEAD K DOESN'T WARRNT GOING TO INTER ALL JUST WHAT IT MIGHT UM YOU KNOW ISTUFF THENCTO BE O THEM ALL JIS OPTOMATRISTR UM SO I DON'T THINK WE HEAR OFTEN ENOUGH ABOUT WHERE TO ACCESS THE BEST QUALITY CARE FOR THESE SENCT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT IN THINKING ABOUT SEXUAL DISFUNCTION I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION MORE O LESS IN PARALLEL IF WE CAN ROUND MALE SEXUAL DISFUNCTION AN FEMALE SEXUAL DISFUNCTION AND I ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE WE DO THAT THA DOM CREATING THE CORRECT PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION AS THEY SAY ERECTILE DISFUNCTION IN MALES IS CLEARLY A FORM OF SEXUAL DISFUNCTION WHAT IS THE PARALLEL TO ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION IN FEMALES IS IT LACK OF VATUNAL LUBRICATION AND LACK OF RELAXATION OF THE MAGINA TO HAVE NON PAINFUL INTERCOURSE IS THERE IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TOAVE A PARALLEL CONVERSATION ABOUT THESE TWO THINGS SO IT'S DIFFERENT IN IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THERE THEARE HOMALOGUES RIGHT SO THE PENUS IS THE HOMALOGUE OF THE CLITERIST RIGHT SO THE CLITERUS IS THE YOU KNOW ESSENTUALY THE SAME SORT OF SPUNGY ERECTILE TISSUE THAT YOU SEE IN THE PENUS IT GETS ERECT WITH EROUSAL AND IT IS IT ACTUALLY EXTENDS VERY DEEP INTO THE PALVI SO IT'S NOT JUST A SMALL LITTLE ORGANANCE ACTUALLY QUITE LONG AND SO YOU CAN IN MEN YOU CAN HAVE ERECTILE THISFUNCTION CAUSE YOU CAN SEE IT BUT IN WOMEN YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH ORGASM AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY A PARALLEL BUT DIFFICULTY ORGASMING IN WOMEN IS MULTYFACTORIAL AND CAN GET INTO THAT BUT I THINK THE'RE THE'RE THER DIFFERENT AND I THINK ALSO SEXUAL DISFUNCTION PRESENTS DIFFERENTLY IN BOTH GENDERS SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MEN THEI'RE VERY THE ONE VISUAL THEY SEE OF AROUSAL IS ERECTIONS AND SO IT BECOMES VERY IN GRAINED IN YOUR PSYCHE THAT IF I DON'T HAVE AN ERECTION I'M NOT AROUSED RIGHT BUT THEREIS A LOT OF REASONS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE AN ERECTION THAT WE'VE SORT O TOUCHED ON VASCULAR PROBLEMS HARMONAL PROBLEMS NOR LOGIC PROBLEMS A PSYCHOGETIC ISSUES AND OTHER MEDICATIONS YOU'RE TAKING SO THERE ARE ISSUES THAT CAN EFFECT A RACTILE FUNCTION AND AND SO THAT CAN BE PART OF IT WHERE YEU KNOW YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE LOW DESIRE BECAUSE TYOURE ROUSALS NOT THERE NOT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING FOR WOMEN WHAT THEY CAN ASSAS IS THEIR LEVEL OF LUBRICATION IF SECTS HERTS AND IF THEY GET AN ARGAT THEM AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE WAYS YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THANK YOU FOR FLESHING ALL THAT OUT YOU KNOW YEARS AGO I WORKED ON SEXUAL DIFERENTIATION AN IN PARTICULAR THE ROLE OF HORMONES IN SEXUAL DIFERENTIATION AND INDEED AS YOU DESCRIBED WE LEARN BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT AND I THINK A PEOPLE STILL GENERALLY AGREE THAT IF ONE LOOKS AT THE EMBRYOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE PENUS AND THE CLITERUS THEY ARE SSENTUALLY ANALEGOUS STRUCTURES A AND THAT A LOT OF MALE GENITAL DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES LITERLLY THE REGRESSION THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FEMALE SEXUAL GENITALIUNASSOCIATED OR GINS MOLARYAN DUCK SOMETHINGS LIKE THAT AND WHAT WOULD BECOME THE OVERIES BECOME THE TESTIES ET CETERA ET CETERA THOSE ARE INATOMICAL PARALLELS BUT WHILL YOU JUST DESCRIBE FOR US A VERY BEAUTIFULLY IS THE RFUNCTIONAL PARALLELS HAS IT RELATES TO SEXUAL FUNCTION AND DISFUNCTION SO I'M HOPING WITH TAT FRAMING THAT WE CAN A THAT WE CAN A KNOCK DOWN A FEW THESE PINS A IN A LITTLE LESS TIME  BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT TO TACKLE HERE FIRST OFF ID LIKE TO DADDRESS THE HORMONAL ISSUES YOU MENTION THAT ONLY THREE PER CENT OF RECTILE DIS FUNCTION AND BY EXTENSION CAN WE SAY ALSO A FEMALE A ISSUES WET SEXUAL ROUSAL OR HORMONAL AN ORIGIN IS THAT RIGHT SO WITH DESIRE YES OCHEY ARE HARMONAL AND IN GENERAL AN AROUSAL IN TERMS OF LUBRICATION IF YOURE USING THAT AS A AS A BAROMETER YES YOU CAN SEE LESS VAGN LUBRICATION DO TO HARMONES AND I CEXECY THREE TO SIX PER CENT MOR YOU KNOW UP TO SIX PERCENT WE SEE OF ERECTHIW TOS FUNCTION IS HARMONAL IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE ENTIRE ENTIRELY OF ERECTILE T' FUNCTION AS SO I THINK IN LOOKING ON THE LANDSCAPE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PODCAST AND AND JUST IN THE COMMON A MIND SET WE'VE ALL COME TO BELIEVE THAT TESTOSTRONE IS PROLABIDO IT'S PRO DESIRE IN MEN AND WOMEN THINK NOW PEOPLE AR STRNG APPRECIATE THATS PRO DESIRE IN WOMEN AS WELL UM ZURLIAN MEN AND THAT DOPAMINE IS ALSO ASSOCIATE WITH DESIRE AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC TENS TO HAVE THIS VIEW OF ESTROGEN IS BEING SORT OF ANTI LABIDO OR ANTI MALE WHICH IS FRANKLY FALSE IN FACT EN OVE COVER THIS ON THE PODCAST WITH DOCTOR COLLGELATTEN WITH DOCTOR PETER ATTIA AND UM ANOTHER FELLOW A UTUBER A DERIC FOR MORE PLATES MOREDATES HAS TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF PEOPLE IF MEN EXCUSE ME TAKE DRUGS LIKE AN ASTROZOL TO SUPPRESS THE RESTROGEN THINKING THAT OH IT'S ALL ABOUT HAVING HIGH TOSTOSTERON LOESTROGEN OFTENTIMES THEY CRUSH THEIR LABIDA JUST ABOLISH IT AWHICH UM HAS LED TO A SLOWLY GROWING BUT AI THINK POSITIVE SHIFT IN HOW PEOPLE ORE THING ABOUT ESTERGEN ESTEROGEN'S GREATE FOR BRAIN FUNCTION ESTROGEN'S GREATE FOR LABIDO IN MEN AND WOMEN UM AND THAT IS A REVISION OF A I THINK HOW MOST PEOPLE THINK OF THE MALE SEXUAL RESPONSE IT'S MORE IN KEEPING WITHOUT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE FEMALE SEXUAL RESPONSE OH ESTEROGEN AND THE FEMALE SEXUAL RESPONSE THAT THAT MAKE SENSE BUT WET WERE TRYING TO DO HERE IS CLARIFY SOME OF THE A MIS CONCEPTIONS NOW THE REASON I MENTION DOPAMINE IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT DOPOMINE IS INVOLVED IN THE ERALT THEEXCUSES ME THE DESIRE RESPONSE WE WILL DISTINGUISH DESIRE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AROUSAL FROM GENITAL AROUSAL PHYSICAL AROUSAL AND THAT PROLACTIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFRACTORY PERIOD DURING WHICH IRECTION CAN'T OCCUR ANOTHER PERHAPS ORGASM CAN'T OCCUR IN FEMALES ET CETERA BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S ALSO NOT AT SIMPLE AND WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK PERHAPS AND JUST TALK ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE DESIRE AND AN AROUSAL RESPONSE SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WAS TAUGHT AND THE CAN TELL ME WHERE IT'S WRONG I HOPE I WAS TAUGHT THAT THE ERECTION RESPONSE AND THE RAGENAL LUBRICATION RESPONSE IS GENERATED BY THE PARA SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE RELAXED THE REST AND DIGEST ASPECT OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM HENCE WHY SOME PEOPLE CAN GET PSYCHOGENIC SEXUAL ISSUES OF LACK OF ERECTION OR LACK OF VAGIONAL LUBRICATION BUT THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE FOR WHOM A LOT OF ALERTNESS MAY BE EVEN AND THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL THING BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE EVEN SOME SENSE OF AGGRESSION OR KIND OF EGINESS OR EXCITEMENT ADRENOLIN IN OTHER WORDS CAN STIMULATE IRECTION OR VATIONAL LUBRICATION SO IT GETS TRICKY I IT'S NOT LIKE THE TEX BOOKS IS NOT LIKE IT THEY TAUGHT US IN HIGH SCHOOL AS FAR AS I KNOW I WAS TAUGHT THAT THE AROUSAL RESPONSE IN MALES OF FEMALES IS INITIATE BY A PARA SYMPATHETIC TO RELAXED TONE AND THAT AS SEXUAL DESIRE AND A ROUSAL AND SEX OR MASTURBATION PROGRESSES THAT IT SHIFTS MORE TOWARDS THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH HAS NOTHING DO WITH TEMOTIONAL SYMPATHY AND HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH AROUSAL THE CATACOLAMINES DOPAMY NOREPANAFRAN AN EPANAFRAN ALSO CALLED AE DRENALINAN NORA DRENALIN A RELEASED AND THAT THE CLIMAX RESPONSE IT WHICH MAYOR MAY NOT INCLUDE EJACULATION WE HAVE TO SEPARATE THAT OUT IS ONE THAT IS REALLY OF THE STRESS SYSTEM OF THE BODY AND THEN IN THE POSTCOIDAL OR POSTEJACULATORY OR POSTCLIMAX PHASE THAN THERE'S A SHIFT BACK TO THE PARA SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM UM THAT'S WHERE OM THE A PILLOTAC AND THE A THE EXCHANGE OF A ODORS AND TASTES AND OTHER MOLECULES IS KNOWN TO ENHANCE PARBONDING THROUGH THINGS LIKE OXYTOSIN VASO PRESSON AND SO ON AND AT WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS EXCEEDINGLY OVERSYMPLIFIED I REALIZE BUT IS THAT MORE OR LESS HOW THE PHYSIOLOGY WORKS YES A THE WAY WHERE TOT IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS POINT AND SHOOT THEPOINT IS THE PARI SYMPATHETIC NERVI TE TINAL YOR ALL THE MAADINTS  LIKE THAT ONE AND THAT TEDER YOU GO ON TO THE SYMPATHETIC NERVES BUT IT MAKES THENE AND THE REASON THAT I THINK YOURE HEARING AB T THIS AGGRESSION OR OR THESE THINGS THERE LEADING TO AROUSAL IS BECAUSE THERE NEEDS TO BE A STIMULUS RIGT A VISUAL STIMULUS A TACTILE STIMULUS SOME SORT OF STIMULUS AT YOU'R GETTING THAT IS THEN CAUSING THE RELEASE OF NITRIC OXIDE FROM THE PARISYMPTHIC NERVOU SYSTEM AND THAT COULD BE FOR SOME PEOPLE AGGRESSION OR YOU KNOW SOME FORM OF THAT RIGHT YES AL WY PEOPLE ABOUT NITRI GOXIDE BECAUSE WE'LL GET INTO THIS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AM DRUG STAT INCREASED BLOOD FLOW NA YALISH BY AGRA AND ALSO AM NON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THINGS LIKE A ELSEA TRILINE NARGINE AND AM WATER MELLON FOR THAT MATTER RI OW ANS THAT SO I READ ON THE INTURN A GET HOM SO YET SO NITRIC OXIDE IS ESSENTIALLY THE IGNITION FOR WHAT WE SAY FOR ERECTIONS DIGNITION FOR ERECTIONS THAT WE IF YOU THOUGHT THE REASON I TALK ABOUT ERECTIONS MORE OFTEN AS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IN FACT THERE WAS A PAPER ON THIS WHERE THEY LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES THAT CAME UP WHEN YOU PUT IN THE WORD PENUS AND THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES THAT CAME UP WHEN YOU PUT N THE WORD CLITERUS AND IT WITH FIFTY THOUSAND ABOUT PENUS AND TWO THOUSAND ABOUT THE CLITERUS OCAN WE HAVE  THIS WAS ACTIA MAJOR SECTION OF THE COMMENTS YET ON WHEN I ASKED FOR FOR QUESTIONS ON IN STEGAM I'M IN COMMENTS ON COMMENTS AND YE HOW COME AM WHY NOT A ET CETERA IS THAT BECAUSE THE EUROLOGY AND AM SEXUAL HEALLH FIELD WAS DOMINATED BY MEN THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PRESUMPTION WOR'S IT BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO STUDY SOMEHOW OER I MEN WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WE I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF AM ANDYOU CAN GO BACK TO LIKE FROID WHERE HE THOUGHT THAT THAT THE FEMALE SEXUAL RESPONSE WAS LESS VALUABLE AND AND SO THERE ARE SOME SOME RES VALUBLE I YES I NOT LI THAS TE RIGHT I ARM B O NO NOON NO I OI R TURIS MAN AN I YOU KNOW  WIT THESE WOIN I TO D YOU SAD WITH IT RIGHT WL YO AT WAS BUT IT WAS MORE ABOUT THE MALE SEXUAL RESPONSE THAN THE FEMALE SEXUAL RESPONSE AND SO IN GENERAL YES THERE IS YOU KNOW THERE WERE MORE MEN IN MEDICINE THERE WAS MORE AN IT IS EASIER TO STUDY RIGHT YOU CAN'T SAY THE CLEAREST UITE AS EASY AS YOU CAN STUDY THE MALE PENUS RESPONSE CAUSE YOU CAN SEE IT VISUALLY YOU CAN INJECTED AND SEE AND ERECTION RESPONSE WHERE YUWE DO THIS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECTILE THIS FUNCTION THEY'LL TAKE MEDICATIONS THAT INCREASE BLOOD FLOW LIKE TRIMAXS YOU'LL INJECTIT INTO THE PENUS AND YOU'LL SEE IN ERECTIONS SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRY MIX TRYMAC SO THERE'S IT'S INGURED ALL THE ENTARMAL LON IS JUST WHEN WE WHAT AR YOU ENJECTING TE TON THERE THERE ARE THEY'RE THREE BASICALLY BRAND NAMES OF INTRICAVERNOSAL INJECTIONS THAT WE USE FOR RECTILE THIS FUNCTION I HEAR INJECTION AN NICENT I I THINK I  I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT REFLECTS A UNNATURAL MALER SWHATS I SORT OF A OM I TAKEN ABACK AT MAS IS A POIC FOR CONTRACTTHECE OH SO IT IS IT IS CARY TO HEAR ABOUT IT'S A VERY SMALL NEEDLE IT IS VERY WELL TOLERATED I'VE DOT IT TO PATIONS AIN THE OFFICE AND THEY LOOK IM MESEY OU'RE DONE LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT AS PAINFUL AS IT SEEMS AND WHEN YOU ARE NOT HAVING ERECTIONS AND YOU'VE TRIED MULTIPLE THINGS PEOPLE GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE WILLING TO TRY THAT I YOU KNOW AND AND SO IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE NON SORGICAL TREATMEND WE HAVE FOR RECTILE THIS FUNCTION AND IT'S USUALLY EITHER ONE MEDICATION TWO MEDICATIONS ARE THREE SO YOU CAN HAVE YOU KNOW I'LL PROCIDE PAVERINE AND THIRD ONE THAT'S YEA WECAN OM LOK A SON PUT IN THE COMIS OM I SURELY THEY WOM WHAT WHAT IS IT DESIGN TO DO AS IT IS IT OM A EAS O TOLATER A SORT SO THEY THEY THE WORK IN DIFFERENT MECHANISM BUT SIMILAR TO THE MEDICATIONS THAT WE HAVE P T FIVE INHIBITERS PT FIVE IN HIBITERS WORK IN TE ERECTION CASCADE BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS LET'S ECTU MUTST TAY GET BACK TO THE NITRIC OXIDE THING WILL GET THERE SO NITRI GOXSIDE ESSENTUALLY IS RELEASED BY THE END OFTHELIUM IN RESPONSE TO A VISUAL TACTILE STIMULAT STIMULATING CU RIGHT AND SO YOUR BODY RELEASES NITRICOXIDE WHICH THEN SETS OFF THE CASCADE FOR THE ERECTION AND SO THAT RELEASE IS F G N P WHICH IS WHICH IS CAUSES THE ERECTION AND IT'S DEGRADED BY PHOSPHO DIASTERAS AND SO MEDICATIONS THAT INHIBIT FOSSHOOD DIESTERACE LIKE VIAGARA AND SIALIS TEND TO PREVENT THE BREAK DOWN OF THAT SIGIAN PIECEE HAVE LONGER LASTING ERECTIONS AND SO SIMILARLY THESE MEDICATIONS WORK SORT OF SIMILAR TO THAT SOME OF THEM WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY WORK BUT THEY WORK BY INCREASE INCREASING SEGYAN PIER S AN P THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THOSE CASCADES AND WHAT ABOUT ELSE SO TRILLING I HEAREABOUT ELSE SOTRILING USED TO SAIT OVER THE COUNTER SUPPLEMENT UM AND IT'S IN THE ARGENING PATHWAY AND O MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WORK SIMILARLY TO THINGS LIKE A SEALOSPHIAGRA BUT IS PERHAPS NOT AS POTENT ELSE SUGGUST A CAUTIONARY NO DOUT THERE ELSE SO TRILING CAN GIVE PEOPLE VICIOUS COLD SORES AN CANKER SORES VICIOUS A YOU HEARE ABOUT THIS ON THE NTERNATIT'S BEEN VERIFIED BY GROTESQUE IMAGES THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO GOUGLE FOR UM AND NOT EVERY ONE TOLERATES IT WELL SO THESE ACTUALLY WORK BY INCREASING NITRIC OXIDE SO THEY'RE NOT IN THE THEY'RE NOT LATER DOWN THE PATHWAY THEIRE ACTUALLY INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF NITRIC OXIDE SO ELL ARGENING IS THE MORE DIRECT PATHWAY BUT IT'S VERY LOW BILEAVALABILITY ELSITRALYIN CONVERTS TELL ARGENING BUT IT IS LAST MUCH LONGER IN THE BLOUDSTRIN WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE TEND TO USE ELSA TRILLING NOW YOU KNOW IN IN SEXUAL MEDICIN THESE SUPPLEMENTS WHILE THEREHAS BEEN SOME STUDIES ON THEM AND THEY ARE EFFACTIVE THERE'S NO REGULATION ON THE SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY SO YOU KNOW WE CAN RECOMMEND THEM BUT WE JUST CAN'T SAY THAT FOR SURE THAT THE SUPPLEMENT IS EXACTLY WHATS SAID ON THE BOTTLE WE SEE LOTS OF STUDIES WHERE THEYLL SAY YOU KNOW I READ ONE ABOUT MELATONAN AND THERE'S YOU KNOW A VARIATION OF MELATONEN FROM LIKE WHAT'S ON THE BOTTLE TO FOUR HUN PER CENT TIMES MORE AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE STRUGGLE THAT WE AS MEDICAL DOCTORS HAVE AT I KNOW WE GET A LOT OF SLACK FOR IT THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS BUT IT'S REALLY THE CHALLENGE THERE IS LIKE FINDING THE QUALITY SUPPLEMENT A GREAT SITE IS A WHICH I'VE NO A RELATIONSHIP TO I EXCEPT THAT I MENTION THEM ALL THE TIME UM IS EXAMINED NOT CALM OW MICH AT IT HAS REFERENCES TO HUMAN STUDYES R SEND WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF EFFIC TO SY SHOWN AND WEL GET INTO SOME SIDE OFFECT ISSUES DOES CAN'T ADDRESS BRI AM YOU KNOW QUALITY BY BRANDISSUES BUT M THANKS FOR MENTIONING THAT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF MALES WHO TAKE SEALIS AM TTACA TO DALPHIL OR VIAGRA WER RECTILE THIS FUNCTION GET A RELIEF FROM THAT  BECAUSE YOU MENTION ONLY THREE PERCENT OF ERECTILE ISSUES AN MALES OR FORMAMALLY IN ORIGIN  BUT WHAT PER CENTAGE AR LIKELY TO BE BLOODFLOW RELATED IN ORIGIN SO A LARGE PER CENTAGE OUR BLOOD FL RELATED THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE MEDICATION WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR EVERY ONE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LARGE PERCENTAGE ARE ARE VASCULAR IN NATURE AT THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE IN IN AS MEN AGE SO WE KNOW THAT ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF MEN OVER THE AGE OF FORTY WILL HAVE ERECTILE TIS FUNCTION AND THAT CONTINUES TO INCREASE AS YOU AGE SO AFIFTY PERCENT OF FIFTY YEAR OLD SIXTY PERCENT OF SIXTY YEAR OLD AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO IT'S VERY VERY COMMON AND THE SUCCESS RATE IN THE STUDIES OS ABOUT SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT SO WHEN YOU GIVE SOME ONE A MEDICATION THEY WILL HAVE SUSTAIND ERECTIONS THAT ARE SUFFICIENT PER PENETRATIVE INTERCOURSE WHICH IS THE WAY WE KIND OF DISCUSS ERECTILE TIS FUNCTION IN STUDIES AND IN UNO WITH PATIONS IS IS ABOUT SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT SO NOT EVERY ONE WILL HAVE SUCCESS BUT NOT ALL F THAT IS BECAUSE THE MEDICATION DOESN'T WORK A SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKING THEM CORRECTLY SO IS YE ILING TO TRI TO FRENT DOSES AND THEN THEY'RE STILL THIS ISSUE OF YOUR YOUR BRAIN IS TOLACTIVE AND SO IF YOUR HAVING ANXIETYOR HAVING OTHEIR ISSUES ARE STRESS IN YOUR LIFE THACT CAN HAVAN AF FACT ON YOUR ABILITY TO CREATE IN ERECTION SO THERE'S LOTS OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO IT A BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THEY ARE FACTIVE AND THEY DO WORK QUITE WELL AND THEY'RE TOLERATED PRETTY WELL AS TISE TI SEVENY PERCENT IS NOT A SMALL NUMBER THA THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER THAT'S THE MAJORITY AAT BY I SIGNIFICANT MARGIN IS THERE ABASIUS FOR THE USE OF A SALS A TO DALPHIL VIAGRA A ELSSITRULINE IM IN FEMALES THO YET THERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DAYT ON THIS BUT CERTAINLY OU KNOW IF YOU HAVE SURMISE THAT THERE IS A BLOOD FLOW ISSUE AND THER HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH ORGAS THEM IN CERTAINLY COMETHING CAN TRYALFULLY BULL AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE DO TRY I TRY THESE MEDICATIONS OFFULYABLE TO SEE IF THEY IMPROVE SACUAL FUNCTION FOR WOMEN BUT THERE'S NOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF ROBUST YOU KNOW RANDOMATS CONTROL TRIAL STUDIES ON WOMEN WITH WITH THESE MEDICATIONS LUBIT LATER WE WILL TALK ABOUT PROSTRATE HEALTH SPECIFICALLY BUT I'M JUST GOING TO IM MAKE A NOTE HERE THAT IM NOWADAYS THERE'S I'M INCREASING USE OF LO DOSAGE IM SEALIS SLASH TO DALIFILL I'M SO RATHER THAN I WHAT I FOUND ON LINE WAS THAT THE ERECTILE DISFUNCTION TREATMENT DOSAGE OF SEALS TO DALFILLS SOMEWHERE IN THE U FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILIGRAM RANGE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS I'M DAILY USE OF IM TWO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MILIGRAMS OF SEALS TO DLFILLE FOR PROSTRATE HEALTH AND I LEARNED IN RESEARCHING FOR THIS EPISODE THAT IM TODALFILL EALIS WAS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED AS A DRUG FOR THE TREATMENT OF PROSTRATE HEALTH TO AM ESSENTIALLY INCREASED BLOODFLOW THE PROSTRATE TO INCREASE PROSTRATE HEALTH NOT FOR THE TREATMENT OF RECTILE THIS FUNCTION SO I I FOUND THAT TO BE SOMEWHAT INTERESTING IM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW STARTING TO USE THAT I ALSO LEARNED THAT AM IF YOU DIVE INTO THE A THE GUTS OF THE INNERNET IM ONE CAN FIND THAT NOW THERE'S A GROWING USE OF COMBINED LODOSAGE SEALIS AN APIL MORPHINE WHICH IS A PRODOPAMANURGECT AGENT I WILL GET BACK TO DOPEING A LIMENT LATER BUT IM IS THERE ANY BASIS FOR LO DOSAGE SAY TWO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MILIGRAM DAILY USE OF SEALIS TO DALIFILLE IN FEMALES YET THO WEL LET'S TALK ABOUT IT FOR MALES AND THEMALES I THINK LO DOSE DAILY SEALIS IS EXCELLENT FOR ERACTILE FUNCTION IN MEN EVENS THAT TRUE EVEN A SORRY INTERRUPTED  THAT TRU EVEN FOR MEN THAT ARE NOT EXPERIENCING ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION IT'S NOT INDICATED FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT THERE'S A THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW ITS INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE ARIA THOU PEOPLE I I'VE PERSONALLY USED IT FOR MEN WHO HAVE PAW THE PAIN TO HELP WITH INCREATSING BLOOD FLOW YOU CAN ALSO USE IT POTENTIALLY AS A PREVENTATIVE TO SOME PEOPLE HAVE YOU DON'T COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT'L GETS INCRESING BLOOD FLOODS PREVENTING FIBROSIS OF THAT ERECTILE TISSUE THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH AGE OR OTHEIR VASCULAIR PROBLEMS THOUGH IT MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR THAT AS WELL ALTHOUGH AGAIN THAT'S AWF LABEL AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WE GENERALLY AM PROMOTE A AS FAR AS FOR WOMEN THERE'S YOU KNOW AGAIN IT CAN HELP WITH BLOOD FUSS IF YOUR HAVING ISSUES OF YOU HAVE A FEMALES HAVING SEXUAL DISFUNCTION AND SHE'S GOT KINDS OF VASK THEIR PROBLEMS THAT SHE'S GOT A DIBEDIES HIGHBLOOD PRESSURE SHE SMOKE SENT YES ITS CERTAINLY REASONABLE TO TRY AND SEE HOW THEY DO USUALLY WANT TO GIVE AT LEAST A FOUR WEEK TRIAL TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY BENEFIT WITH THOSE MEDICATIONS G THANK YOU FOR THAT UM WHY IS IT THAT I GET SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION FROM MALES WHO WERE IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU SAID UP UNTIL NOW WAS MAINLY FOCASED ON MEN FORTY YEARS AND OLDER IS IT FROM LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER USIVE NICCOTINE BY THE WAY VAPING AS FAR AS WE KNOW UM VAPING IN SMOKING BAD FOR ERECTILE FUNCTION AND PERHAPS SEXUAL HEALTH AND MALES AND FEMALES GENERALLY BECAUSE NICOTINE IS AVES O CONSTRICTOR NICTING DOES HAVE CERTAIN BENEFITS AND I COVER THIS IN AN EPISODE ON NICCOTINE AM NORCOGNIVE BENEFITS IN A THE ELDERLY IN PARTICULAR BUT IT IS OF AS A CONSTRICTOR SO IT RUNS AGAINST ALL OF THE A SEXUAL ROUSAL STUFF THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT M BUT OKAT LET'S ASSUME THAT UM A MALE IN THEIR TWENTIES OR THIRTESIS SLEEPING ENOUGH YOU KNOW SIXTEEGHT HOURS A NIGHT IS EXERCISING ISN'T DOING ANYTHING TO PUNISH THEIR PELVIC FLOOR IN THE GIM UM YOU KNOW THE'RE NOT DOING A LEGS CROSS KEAGLES WHILE DOING CRUNCTIES OR SOMETHING WHILE INHALING I UM I THAT WAS A QUIZ BY THE WAY UM OF FER EARLIER TOPICS COVERED UM LET'S ASSUME THEIR YU KNOW EATING PRETTY WELL MAJORY THE FOODS ARE COMING FROM NON PROCESS OR MANLY PROCESS FOODS UM THE DUNAL MEDITATION EACH DAY THEIR ENGAGING IN HOPEFULLY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS THEY'RE NOT MASTERBETING LIKE CRAZY TO PORN AND UM I YOU KNOW LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW NOT ON ANY ASSESSORI WIRE ALL THESE TWENTY THIRTY YEARLS ON THE INNERNET ASKING MAINLY YOU THIS IS THEY A RUNDER YOU UM BUT ALSO TO MY DIRECT MESSAGES ABOUT THEIR RECTILE OFSHUES SO I WILL SAY I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF YOUNG MEN IN MY CLINIC AND I WILL SAY THAT THEY VERY OFTEN HAVE PAVIC FLARTIS FUNCTION SO THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS THERE THEY DO HAV ME WERE IN ISTRESSFUL SOCIETY TO YOU CAN TRY ALL THE THINGS TO BE TO DENCREASE YOUR STRESS BUT LOT OF US ARE SITTING LONG PERIODS OF TIME ESPECIALLY DURING COVIT I MEAN PEOPLE SAT FOR MONTH RIGHT YEARS JUST SITTING AT THEIR HOME COMPETER AND SO  YOU KNOW EXERCISING ONE HOUR IS NOT GON OFF AT THE DAY FULL OF SITTING AND SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAN AFFECT PUVIC FLOR FUNCTIONS SO MY THEORYES THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE MORE COMMON CAUSE TO WALK MORE YEIVE ATUIS ETANDING DESK YEWALK MORE STANDING DESK UM WO CASE SO UM AND THEN MY GUESTS IS THAT THERE'S SOME PSYCHOGENIC FEED BACK LOOP ABSOLUTELY JUST NER SPEAK FOR THINGS AREN'T WORKING AS WELL AS THEY WOULD LIKE THAN THEI'RE STRESSING ABOUT IT IN THE STRESS IS MAKING THINGS WORSE ABSOLUTELY AND U NOW YOU MENTION THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT MASTER BATING OR YOURE USING PORN BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT SEX THER PORN WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD WE CAN'T YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A GREAT THINK BUT LIKE THAT'S ACCESSIBLE NOW WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP YOU HAD TO FIND AF ECE ARE YOU HAD TO FIND A QUIET ROOM THAT NO ONE WAS IN A WALK IN I'M LIKE ENOUGH TO REMEMBEREN THE TON THE STRET I WON'T MENTION EM UM A BY LAST NAME BUT YET KIDDON THE STREET OU KNO HAD AM PORNO MAGAZINES YOR MAGAZINE AND THEN THERE WAS ASHY A LIBRARY OF THESE GOODNESS ESSION SAY WHETHER THEY WHEREM IN THE TIL THIY GROPING WHERE KIDS WOULD STASH THEM IN AM IN SPISVY LOCATIONS IN PARKING LOTS AND THEN YOU NOT BOYS WOULD BIKER SCAPE WORD OVER WULD WALK OVER AND THEN THEY WOULD LIKE TAKE TERMS TAKE DIFFERENCE USE ME LOOKING AT THEM BUT THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS TO RAISE A PERHAPS A MORE IMPORTANT POINT AM WHICH IS THAT LOOKING AT PORNOGRAPHY IS DIFFERENT IN MASTERBATING TO PORNOGRAPHY WHICH IS ALSO DIFFRENTHAN MASTERBATING TO PORNOGRAPHY TO THE POINT OF EJACULATION RIGHT BECAUSE AM I ALSO GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PORN EDICTION ISSUES AND THERE'S A GROWING THEORY OUT THERE THAT OVERUSE THAT MEANING NOT JUST LOOKING AT BUT A MASTERBATING TO PORNGRAPHY TO THE POINT OF EJACULATION IS CREATING A DEFICIT OF SEEKING OUT AN AM DECULTIVATING HEALTHY REAL WORLD SEXUAL INTERACTIONS YES I WENTIT I WENT AT START THIS BEFORE I GET INTO THAT IS IS TO SAY THAT IF YOUR MASTERING TO PORIN AND YOU HAVE NORMAL HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND YOUR GOING TO WORK AND YOUR HAVE A GREAT WE NO A PARTNER AND YOU AEVEREATHING GREAT IN YOUR LIFE IT' SO CATE LIKE SHAME IS THE REAL PROBLEM AND I MAYE THE WATCHING PORNOGRAPHY TOGETHER YES SO I THINK INVITING IT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH THAT IT LEAST IN A LITERATURE THEY DESCRIBE THEY DON'T DESCRIBE PORNEDICTION THEY CALL IT POR PROBLEMATIC PORNOGRAPHY YOUTH AND IT'S ONLY DESCRIBE ING ABOUT FOUR PER CENT OF PEOPLE IN THESE STUDIES SO IT'S IT'S A SMALL SUBSET OF PEOPLE I THINK IT'S BECOMING MORE COMMON BECAUSE PORNOGRAPHY IS SO EXCESSIBLE AND IT IT ACT TOBES TA DOPEMING PATHWAYS JUST THIK ANY OTHER SORT OF EDDICTION RITE YOU YOU WATCH PORNOGRAPHY YOU GET A DOPA MEN RESPONSE YOUR BRAIN THEN AYS THOUGH I WANT O I WANT THAT AGAIN AND YOU KEEP SEEKING MORE NOVEL MORE A GRASSIVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PORNOGRAPHY TO GET THAT SAME M RESPONDS BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN T EVERYBODY BUTD ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY  IT IS SORRY AT GINTERU BUT UM THAT THE DOPEING RESPONSE AS IT AS A HARD WORD BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM UM FOR ADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS INCLUDING UNLESS JUST A FINE HEALTHY SECUAL BEHAVIOR BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE UM THERE' SUCH A RANGE ON THAT DEPENDNGON ONE'S BACKGROUND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IT TETTER UM ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT SECTS ON THIS PODCASTELIC TO SAY THAT INVOLVES AT LEAST POOR THINGS OBVIOUSLY CONSENSUAL AGE APPROPRIATE CONTECT APPROPRIATE SPECIES APPROPRIATE YES ABSOLUTELY ABSOLTE THATI'M THATREALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UPSTE I'VE PHERADE YOU SGET AT BEFOR BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW THERE IS A SPECTRUM A LARGE SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE WHO WATCH PONOGRAPHY EXJACTLY TO PONOGRAPHY AND HAVE A NORMAL LIFE AND SO THAT'S FINE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF WE SHAME THOSE PEOPLE WERE CREATING PROBLEMS RIGHT WE SAY LIKE OH YOU UDO THAT THAT'S HORRIBLE AND THEN THEY'RE IN THEIR HEAD RIGHT AND THEIR CAUSING PROBLEMS IN THEIR LIFE BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE OF SHAME AND SO THERE'S I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF AM CULTURAL SHAME THAT COMES OF THIS DISCUSSION AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM IN THE LONG TERM IF WE IF WE SAY THAT OH THIS IS GOIN  CREATE PROMISAN NOT EVERYONE HAS THEIRE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WATCH PONOGRAPHY AND HAVE NO PROBLEMS WHO YOU KNOW HAVE NORMAL HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP'S GREAT SEX WITH THEIR PARTNER AND IT'S FINE OR THEYWERE NOT REGARING ORTHER BETWEEN RELATIONSHIPS YE AND THE RELYING ON MASTURBATION SPECIFICALLY I UM ARE THERE ANY DATA THAT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN M JUST PURE IMAGINATION PHANTASY VERSES VISUAL PHANTASY UM AS IT RELATES TO DEVELOPING OR INHIBITING SEXUAL HEALTH AND HERE WE TLING ABOUT THE DESIRE ASPECT LET'S ASSUME PHYSICAL AROUSALS YOU KNOW HANDLED SO I DON'T ONT INTENDED SO I THINK THAT A THE THE THE THINK ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE WANT TO GET BACK TO THAT THE L IN'S YOUR QUESTION BUT THE THING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING PIOGRAPHY THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK SACT I SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THEY DON'T GET AN EDUCATION ABOUT HAT SEX IS RIGHT NO ONE HAS THE CONVERSATION WITH THEIR KIDS LIKE HAGIS THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE SEXES HOW LONG IT SHOULD TAKE THIS IS WHAT FOR PLAY IS AND THIS IS LIKE NOT NORMAL THIS IS THE PRODUCTION THIS IS A PRODUCED PRODUCT THAT MEANT TO AROUSE YO RIGHT AND AND TO GIVE YOU IDEALY AN EJACULATION ARE AN ARGASM RIGHT SO O NO ONE HAS THAT DISCUSSIONS THAT THEN GO TO RELATIONSHIPS LAKE WI AND MY PARTNER NOT REACT LIKE THAT WOMAN DID ON THE PORNO RIGHT OR WHY DID I NOT REACT LIKE THAT WOMAN DID ON THE PORNOUT RA WHY DIDN'T HE REACT YE WHEN YOU KNOW LIKE THEY WHOULD IN PORN BECAUSE CAN NI THINK FEMALES OR WATCHING PORNIS WELL DECTLY NO I THINK I SHALL I THINK THAT A YOU RAISE OF REALLY CRITICAL POINT RHICHS AT THIS SHAME CAN EXTEND BOTH WAYS AND SO I THINK TO THAT AND THAT'S A PROBLEM AND AND BECAUSE IT'S SO EXCESSIBLE I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT THINK IT NEEDS TO BE OPEN WE HAVE TO TALK ABUT SEX AND THT'S WHAT KIND OF WHY DO WHAT I DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS SO PEOPLE KNOW WAT NORMALIS THANK YOU FOR THAT I DO THINK THAT A PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT NORMAL IS IN WHAT THE RANGE ON NORMAL IS KEEPING THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT PLACE EARLIER BECAUSE I DO THINK THOSE ARE UNIVERSAL HEALTHY CONSTRAINT IE CINSENSUAL AGE APPROPRIATE CONTECTS APPROPRIATE SPECIES APPROPRIATE OR I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICKBREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACTER INSIDE TRACRS A

INFORMATION BACK ABOUT BLOODLIPPITS ABOUT HORMONES AND SO ON BUT YOU DON'T KNOWHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WITHINSIDE TRACKOR THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR DATA THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE LIPIDS WIT THOSE HORMON LEVELS ET CETERA MEAN AND BEHAVIOURAL SUPPLEMENT NUTRICIAN AND OTHER PROTOCALLS TO ADJUST THOSE NUMBERS TO BRING THEM INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE IDE AL FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH INSIDE TRACKOR'S ULTIMATE PLAN NOW INCLUDES MEASURES OF BOTH APO B AND OF INSOLENT WHICH ARE KEE INDICATORS OF CARDY OF ASCULAR

OR DOT CALM SLSH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF I ASKED WHETHER OR NOT IMAGINED THE PURE IMAGINATION BASED AROUSAL VERSES AM VISUAL AROUSAL UM AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THE SOUNDS OF OF PEOPLE HAVING SEC IS EXTREMELY AROUSING IFYOU EVER LIVED IN A MAJOR CITY UM LIKE NEW YORK WICH UST WIT SUMMERS IN THE YOU HEAR LOT YR MORE MORE OFTEN THAN YOU DO IN UM THERE IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING FURTHER BAR YOU HEAR PEOPLE HAVING SEX YA IT'S BY IT'S PART OF THE UM ART OF THE AUDITORY LANDSCAPE YET YOUARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER A BUT YET SO THERE'S NOT EXACTLY AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE I DON'T KNOW OF THE DATA THAT LOOKS AT FANTASY VERSES VISUAL VORSES AUDITORY BUT I WILL SAY THAT YOU CAN GET HABITUATED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND THERE IS THAT DATA THAT MAYBE YOU CAN GET HABITUATED TO WATCHING A CERTAIN TYPE OF THING TO GET AROUSED AND THEN NORMAL THINGS DO NOT GET YOU AROUSED RIGHT LIKE YOU MAY WATCH PHRONOGRAPHY AND THEN YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING AROUSED OR TURNED ON WHEN YOU SEE YOUR PARTNER A YOU MAY GET USED TO MASTRATING A CERTAIN WAY RIGHT SO IF YOU USE CERTAIN BARBRATORY STIMULATION OR CERTAIN PRESSUR SENSATION EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU MASTERBAY YOU CAN GET HABITUATED TO THAT AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAPPLICATE THAT DURING PENETRATIVE INTERCOURSE A AND SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE TAKE HOME AS TO TRY AND VARY WHAT YOU'RE DOING MASTERBATION IS FINE HEALTHY WAY OF SELF EXPLORATION AGAIN WITH THE CAVIT AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT MASTERBATING TO ACCESS AND AVOIDING YOUR OBLIGATIONS ARE YOUR FAMILY YOUR PARTNERS YOUR FRIENDS RIGHT LIKE THE ARE JUST MASTERATING FOR THE THE BENEFITS OF MAYBE SLEEP IMPROVE MENT MOODBOOSTAYING REDUCTION IN ANXIETY THOSE THO THOSE THINGS ARE GREAT AND SO I THINK A WITH THAT BEINGS THAT YOU JUST FIND IT BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT VERYING ITAT ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH MASTURBATION THAVE TALKED ABOUT WHEN I WAS A GUEST ON OTHER PODCASTS AMAINLING THE CONTEXT OF MAL MASTURBATION AND UM PERHAPS WITH PORNOGRAPHY PERHAPS NOT IS THAT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR BASE ON THE DT A SURROUNDING A DICTION THAT ANY TIME THERE BIG INCREASES IN DOPOMIN WITHOUT A LOT OF EFFORT REQUIRED TO GENERATE THAT DOPOMIN LIKE TURNING ON PORNOGRAPHY ON THE INNERNET VERSES YOU KNOW ASKING SO ONE OUT ON A DAT GOING OUT ON A DAY YOU KNOW AGAIN BUT IING ABOUT GOING THROUGH THE CONVERSATIONS AND THE MADING RITUAL THAT IS THE HUMAN MADING RITUAL THAT OF COURSE IN THE CONTECTS OF HEALTHY INTERACTIONS IVOLVES GETTING MUTUAL CONSENT AND THESE KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE HOW WITH WITHOUT PLACING ANY MORAL JUDGMENT ON IT WITHOUT SHAMING ANYBODY YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT IF SOMEBODY EXCLUSIVELY MASTURBATED AND DIDN'T DEVELOP THE SKILLS OF COURTSHIP AND BUILDING HEALTHY SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT PORNOGRAPHY END OR MASTURBATION COULD START TO CREATE QUOTING QU PROBLEMS RIGHT WHEREBY SOMEBODY ONLY FELT COMFORTABLE IN THOSE DOMAINS I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING MORE AND MORE ABOUT WHEND IT SEEMS TO BE YOUNG MEN REACH OUT ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK YOU'RE YOU KNOW IT'S EFTLY THE EASE OF ACCESS RIGHT BUT I THINK THAT'S PERVASIVE IN THE YOUNG SOCIETY NOW LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO AND FIND A MATE YOU CAN JUST GO ON AN AT AND LOOK FOR SOMEBODY RIGHT LIKE THERE'S THERE'S OT ANYOME OF FINDING IN IT MAN I  WAS WINED IN THE ERO WHEN A YOU KNOW NO SMARTPHON TRINTHING AND A NO A MY POINT AS I THINK THAT WE'E BECOME VERY AM CONNECTED TO TECHNOLOGY IN OUR WORLD WHICH ALSO MEANS THAT WE'RE HAVING LESS CONVERSATIONS THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS HAVING LESS CONVERSATIONS AND MORE ON LINE CONVERSATIONS THAN I THINK THAT THE SKALE THAT YIS TO BE DEVELOPED AS WELL AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO ALL THIS IS WOLN ONE THING THAT I CAN ATTEST TO IS THAT I GREW UP IN A COMMUNITY OF MOSTLY MALE FRIENDS I'VE FREMALE FRIENDS ALWAYS HAVE AM WHERE A LOT OF WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT SEX CAME FROM OLDER MY CASE GUYS MY SISTER PROBABLY LEARNED ALABOUT SEX FROM HER FEMALE FRIENDS A AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THAT ONE GUY WHO WOULD JUST SAY STUFF THAT YEARS LATER I REALIZE WAS INCREDIBLY MISLEADING INAEVEN JUST DETRIMENTAL AND I JUST WONT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT WHEN YOU ARE ON READIT OR ANYWHERE ON THE INNER NET AND THERE'S PEOPLE SAYING THINGS WITH CERTAINTY AM THEY MIGHT BE THAT GUY YE RIGHT UP AN AND AM AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE IF I LOOK AT THE LONG ARK OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT GUY'S LIFE IT IT DIDN'T SPEAK TO A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN THE DOMAIN FOR WHICH THEY WERE ASSERTING SUCH CONFIDENCE LET ME OP IT OT THAT WAY OK AM I'D LIKE TO SLIGHTLY PIVIT TO A DIFFERENT ASPECT TOF THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT'S JUST REALLY CRITICAL WHICH IS THE FEMALE SEXUAL RESPONSE YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AM DOES NOT GET ENOUGH DISCUSSION ABSOLUNTLY AND THERE'S A LOT OF STEREOTYPES WRITE THE STEREOTYPE THAT WE HEREABOUT IS OH YOU KNOW THEY NEED MORE FOR PLAY WHICH CAN BE TRUE SOME CASES IS NOT TRUE A THE STEREOTYPE IS THAT WOMEN ARE MORE A INTIMACY IN RELATIONSHIP BASED IN THEIR SEXUAL RESPONSE THAT CAN'T BE TRUE I HAVE FEMALE FRIENDS AND HAVE KNOWN WOMEN WHO ALSO ARE JUST REALLY INTEREST IN HAVING SEX FOR SEX SAKE AT TIMES OR MAYBE ALL THE TIME A I THINK I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE PAST THE STAGE OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT WHERE THE STEREOTYPES AROUND THIS ARE A ARE FIXED RIGHT AND I AN AND WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS THAN WE SEE MORE ABOUT THIS NOW BUT WHAT IS THE REAL DEAL AROUND THE FEMALE ROUSAL RESPONSE AND THEN WE ILL TALK ABOUT FEMALE ORGAISM RESPONSE AND THERE I'M JUST GOING TO YOU'RE MORK NOW THAT UM ANY TIME WE SAY SOMETHING LIKE A ROUSAL OR ORGASM THE REMULTIBLE FORMS OF THAT OM THEN WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE MULTIPLE FORMS OF FEMALE ORGANISM YESO IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE RESPONSESYCHLE YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE RESEARCH OF MASTERS AND JOHNSON AND SO WHAT THEY DID THIS WAS WAY BACK ENE AND THEY ACTUALLY WATCHED SEX WORKERS HAVE SEX AND THIS WAS I GESS HI'LL CAYBACK FON MALSIC HEAT WITH MEN SO THAT THEY WATCHED AND TO THEY TOOK NOTE OF THE THE SITE THE KIND OF THE STEPS OF THE FEMALE AROUSAL OR SEXUAL RESPONSE AND SO THE FIRST PHASE IS EXCITEMENT WRIT AND DURING THAT PHASE YOUR HEARTRATE GOES AT YEUR BREATHING LITTLE HEAVIER THERE IS THE SEX FLASH YOU CAN SEE REDNESS AND AREAS LIKE YET YOU KOWING THE VOLVA IN THE BREAST IMEN NIPPLES AND THEN YOU GO TO SORT AND THAT CAN LAST A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TIMES YOU'L ALSO START SEEING SOME LUBRICATION VAGINATLY RIGHT AND THEN THE PLATEAU RESPONSE IS WHEN YOU KNOW THAT IS KIND OF AT ITS PIQUE AN A KIN ASTAYS STEADY AND THEN YOU REACH ORGANASM AND SO ORGAASM ESSENTIALLY IS A RESPONSE TO THE BODY WHERE YOU WILL HAVE AGAIN INCREASED SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE AND YOU WILL HAVE PALVIC FLOR MUSTLE CONTRACTIONS WHICH ARE RHYTHMIC ABOUT POINT EIGHT SECONDS OR SO YOU'RE HAVING A RHYTHMIC PUBLIC FLOOR CONTRACTION ALONG WITH THE SENSATION OF ORGANASM AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE YOUR RECOVERY PERIOD WHICH YOU TALK TABOUT BRIEFLHE EARLIER WHICH CAN HAVE YOU KNOW SORT OF A REFRACTORY TIME PERIOD AT WHICH POINT YOU CAN NO LONGER YOU KNOW ORGAASM AGAIN IF YOU LIKE TO OR FOR MEN TO OBTAIN ANOTHER ERECTION AGAIN FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT CAN BE KIND OF AN ABSOLUTE REFACTORY PERIOD SO WHERE IT'S DEAFLY NOT HAPPENING AND THAN A RELATIVE REFACTORY PERIOD WHERE YOU NEED SOMETHING MORE NOVEL AND EXCITING TO THEN AGAIN RESUME THAT CYCLIC A COOLISH EFFECT THEWOAS EFFECT BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST I'LL JUST CUW PEOPLE TO IT A A TIME STAMPE LINK IN THE SHOWN O CAPTION SO WE DON'T GO THE DOWN THE PATH BUT ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE COOLEGE EFFECT IS PRESENT IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES MEANING IF A MALE EJACULATES AND AM IS OF THE FEELING THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER ERECTION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THE PRESENTATION OF A NOVELE I GUESS WE SHOULD SAK PARTNER BECAUSE WE COUN BE TONG AMOUT HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONSHIP PERED NOT JUST HEATERSEXUAL BUT A A NOVEL SEXUAL PARTNER FEMALE OR MALE DEPENDING ON THEIR A THEIR PROCLIVITIES AM CAN OVERRIDE THE REFACTORY PERIOD M AND THEY CAN HAVE ANOTHER ERECTION AND EJACULATION AM SIMILARLY A FEMALE WILL HAVE A POSTOR GASMIC REFACTORY PERIOD IF THEY'RE AM GIVENG AN ADEQUATE STIMULUS R A SOMETHING AROUSING ENOUGH THEY CAN AM EXPERIENCE AROUSO ORGASUM AGAIN AND WE KNOW BASED ON REALLY GOOD FARMACOLOGY THAT THIS IS A A DOPOMING DRIVEN A THING THE PROLACTIN IS ESSENTIALY ESTABLISHING THE REFRACTORY PERIOD IN THE DOPAMINE IS ESSENTIALLY OVERRIDING THE REFRACTORY PERIOD FASCINATING NER CHEMISTORY THERE A AND SPEAKS TO THE INCREDIBLE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BRAIN IS CONTROLLING THE GENITALS YET LET ME E WE ALWAYS STAY INSEXUAL MEDICON THAT THE BRAIN IS THE MOST POWERFUL ARGAN FOR SACTS NOT NOT YOUR GENITALES BUT THE BRAIN BECAUSE IT IS SO POWERFUL AN I'M NOT CH OF FORNA TOUCH ON THES LATER BUT OL BRING IT UP NOW THERE ARE SOME SENTUALLY ACTING MEDICATIONS NOW AVAILABLE FOR THER AFTERA PROOF FOR PREE MEN OF POSLO WOMEN WITH LOW LIBITA T MAYBE HANTHROW THOS OUT WAS THE ONE THAT I'M AWARE OF A IS A IN THAT'S OFTEN USED IN THE SA NICHE CULTURES A IS MILANACITE SIMULATING HORMON IN MEN ON WHICH GIVES PEOPLE AT HAND MAKES THEM ERECT A MILANACITE SIMULING HORMON AT EMASAGE COMES FROM THE MEDIAL PETUTARIF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AM ONE OF THOSE WEIRD REGIONS NO EVERENCE AT BUT ANTER BUT E AH BUT AND PEOPLE ARE NOW INJACTING THIS IS A PEPTIDE IN CAN CAUSE RIPISM I HAVE NOT HAD THAT EXPERIENCE IV NEVER TRIED THIS AM I MUSTAH BUT ITOLD THAT IT IT PEOPLE ARE GETTING CAVALIER WITH IT THEY CAN ON HAVISHES A PREPISM BEING ENDURING AND PERHAPS EVEN FINAL ERECTION IS THAT TRUE THOU IN PRIE IS A I REIS IS THEM A YO TS ACTULLY FROM PRITIS THE GREEK GOD WHOIS OFTEN PHOTOGRAPHED WITH A REALLY BIG ERECTION WHIL I'M GRANG YU OT ABOUT THAT EGO IN A THAT A UTS AT ROMAN ROMAN A REEK BUT Y MA SO EITHER WE A IT'S AN ERECTION THAT LAST LONGER THAN FOUR HOURS AND IT IS ACTUALLY A SURGICAL OR IT'S NOT A CERGICAL BUT IT'S AN ACTUALLY AN EMERGENCY IF YOU HAVE AN ERECTIO THAT LAST LONGER THAN FOUR HOURS IN THE ABSENCE OF IN O SEXUAL EROUSAL THEND IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET TO AN EMERGENCY ROM BECAUSE AT THAT POINT YOU CONSTRC DEVELOPING DECREASE BLOOD FLOW AND ULTIMATELY NCHANGES TO THE ACTUAL TISSUES SCARRING FIBROSIS A SO ITS TREALY IMPORTANT TO ACTUALLY GO TO THE EMERGE WHOM DON'T WAIT CAUSE YOUR EMBARRASSED A REALLY GET THERE AND GET TREATED HOWEVER IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN EARLIER YOU MENTION THAT IT IS EXCEEDINGLY RARE THAT PEOPLE WHO TAKE SIALIS SLASH TO DALAFILL WER VIAGRA FOR ERECTIONS ARE GETTING TRUE PRIPIZME CORRECT AND IT'S MOSTLY FROM A THOSE INJECTUABLES WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THOSE INTRCAVERNOSAL INJECTIONS PEOPLE CAN GET PRIISM FROM THOSE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMMONLY AND SO THAT SOMETHING WE ALWAYS COUNSELON AND ALSO CERTAIN MEDICATIONS LIKE TRASIDONE A OR IF YOU HAVE SICLE SELANEMIA THOSE ARE THE MOST COMMON REASONS THAT WE SEE PEOPLE COMING AND PRITASI DON REALLY O CAMMAN REFRAINE FROM MY AN DESIRE O FIGURE OUT THAT ONE SO I DON'T TAKE US DOWN A RABBIT WHOLE HERE SI WHEN ONT TO GET BACK TO THE AMES ACH THERE IS ACTUALLY IN AFTY IPROVE MEDICATION CALLED BREMALANATIDE IS THE BRAN NAME VILISI IS THE A THE S BRINMAOTON IS A GENERIC NAME VILISI IS THE BRAND NAME WHICH IS AFTY APPROVED FOR WOMEN WITH WITH LO DES I HYPO ACTIVE SECTUAL DESIRED DISORDER PREMEN APOZZLE WOMEN PREMEN APUZZLE BECAUSE TAT'S WHAT THEY STUDIED BUT IT IS BASICALLY THE SAME PEPTITE WRIGHT SO IT IS A MILANO COURT IN RECEPTOR AGONIST AND IT WORKS DOPAINO ON THE THE BRAIN PATHWAYS TO INCREASE DESIRE IT'S TAKEN AS AN INJECTABLE AGAIN JUST LIKE YOU E SAID ABOUT AN HOUR O FORTY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE WANT WHEN YOU WANT TO WANT YOU TAKE IT FORTY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE AND IT WORKS QUITE EFFECTIVELY IN INCREASING DESIRE HOW LONG DOES IT LAST ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS SOME PEOPLE MAY BE UP TO FORTY EIGHT A AS IT   I KNOW MEN USING A MLETUSIDE STIMULATING FORM ON PEPTIDES EL SO REALLY WONT TO CAUTION PEOPLE A ABOUT OBTAINING GRAY MARKET PEPTIDES SORRY FOR THIS A A INSERTION HERE BUT A THEY'RE A LOT OF PEPTIDES AVAILABLE WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION ON THE INTERNETE THEY ARE ALMOST ALL CONTAMINATED WITH SOMETHING ALLED L P SLOPY POLLY SACARIDE WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BE INJECTING A LOT OVERTIME THAT'S I SAY HOW WE INDUCE IN A MUNRESPONT IN ANIMALS IN THE LABORATORY A AND IT IS AMAZING TO ME HOW MANY A WEBSIDES ARE SELLING THIS STUFF IN IT A ARISE TO YOU EASILY YOU DESPITE ON THE INTERNET SAYS NOT FOR HUMANER ANIMAL USE IN PEOPLE ARE INJECTING IT AND A THE OLPSISSUE IS SOMETHING I THINK IT'S A PUTTETIALLY GET A SHUT DOWN THAT WHOLE MARKET AT SOME POINT BUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTIN USING A PEPTIDE YOU SHOULD BE OBTAINING IT BY A PRESCRIPTION FROM A QUALITY PHYSICIAN EXACTLY IN BECAUSE WE HAVE BREMILANATIDE WE CAN PRESCRIBE THAT FOR MEN AS WELL ALSO SOMETIMES WILL DO IT OFFLABLE FOR MEN WHO ARE HAVING DELATE JACULATION CAUSE IT WILL HELP THEM ACHIEVE ORGASM A LITTLE BIT BETTER A AND SO YOU KNOW THIS IS AVAILABLE FOR PREMENAPASA WOMEN THE OTHER A MEDICATION THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR LOW LABIDO IS CALLED SLABANCRIN ALSO KNOWN IS ADDIE IS THE BRAND NAME AND THAT ALSO WORKS ON SERTINOGE IT'S GOT KIND OF A MIXED RESPONSE SERETONAN AND DOPLEMENERGIC AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND ESSENTIALLY WORKS AS A DAILY MEDICATION TAKEN BEFORE BEDTIME HUNDR MELEGRAMS A DAY THAT ACTUALLY HELPS WITH DECREASING HYPOACTIVE SEXUAL DESIRE DISORDER WORKS IN ABOUT SIXFORTY FIVE TO SIXT E PRESENT I PATIENCE AND YOU NE TO TAKE IT FOR SOME TIME NOW BOTH THESE THAT BRANNY MEDICATIENS SO THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT COSTLY AND SOME TEMPTS I CHARMS DOESN'T COVER THEM BUT THEY ARE AVAILABLE I THINK VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THEM AND I THINK THEY REALLY GREAT AND USEFUL TOOLS IN THE TOLBOX AND THESE ARE FOR DESIRE THEREFORE YES THER THEY RE AFTER AR PROV FOR WHAT WE CALL HYPO ACTIVE SEXUAL DESIRE DISORDER WHICH IS ESSENTUALLY LO LIBIDO THAT CAUSES DISTRESS AND BOTHER I DON'T WANT TO TAKE US OFF COURSE ABOUT A VAGUNAL A LUBRICATION AROUSAL AND FE MORE ORGASM BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A ROUSAL AND AM REDUCED TA ROUSAL THAT REQUIRES TREATMENT I HAVE TO ASK THIS NOW ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT A ROUSAL AND LIBIDO THERE'S NO B M I WHICH BY THE WAY THE BODYMASTINDEX IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST A TOOL EITHER A BUT THERE'S NO CHART IT'S NOT LIKE A THERMOMETER THAT SAYS YOUR NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX PLUSTERMINE AS TOO DEGREES YOUR GOOD IF IT'S TOO HIGH MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT YOU HAVE A FEVER IF MUCH LOWER IN THAT YOUR HYPOTHERMIC SO MY UNDERSTANDING MY I DONO'T THING NI EVE UNDERSTANND BUT A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ONE DETERMINES WHETHER NOT THEIR LIBIDO IS NORMAL HIGH OR LOW LARGELY BASED ON SOME INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEIR PARTNER OR PARTNERS DESIRE WHETHR NOT THEY CAN MEET THOSE DESIRES AND IF THEY SORT OF A A CRUE ENOUGH OF A SAMPLE SIZE THEY DATE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHERE THEY HAVE SEXUAL INTERACTIONS THEY CAN THEY FIGURE OUT OVER TIME WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE A LOW MEDIUM OR HIGH SEX TRIVE AN PEOPLE TEND TO COMPARE TO HOW THEY FELT IN EARLIER YEARS OR AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR OR UNDER DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND STRASS CONDITIONS THAT KIND OF THING BUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A BENCH MARK FOR THIS RIGHT MAY WE CAN'T SAY THAT AM FOR INSTANCE THAT IF I PEOPLE ARE NOT DESIRING SEX ARE THINKING ABOUT SEX WITH BLANK FREQUENCY THAT THEY HAVE LOW LIBIDO RIGHT ITS SORT OF WHAT IS WORKING ORE NOT WORKING FOR YOU IN THE CONTACT OF YOUR LIFE I THAT IS A YET TA VERY GOD TO THINK ABOUT THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG BA ICLY WHAT YOUR THAINK TEREIS NO RIGHT OR WRONG AMONG OF LIBIDO THEREIS MANY PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFIE ASEXUAL AND THEYARE HAPPY WITH THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO I LIKE TO HAVE SEC ONCE A MONTH AND THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THAT IT REALLY IS A MATTER OF DISTRESS ARE YOU BOTHERED BY IT SO WHEN WE LOOK AT STUDIES FOR FEMALE SEXUAL DISFUNCTION YOU CAN USING LIKE VALIATED QUESTIONER S LIKE THAT AFAS AFI YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THAT ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE QUALIFY FOR HAVING SECUAL DISFUNCTION BUT REALLY BOTHER IS ONLY SEEIN ABOUT TWELVE PER CENT AND YOU CAN BE BOTHERED BECAUSE YOUR BOTHERED YOU CAN BE BOTHERED CAUSE YOUR PARTNER IS BOTHERED BUT IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU RIGHT LIKE IF YOU FEEL LIKE THEREIS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT IMPROVE ON THAN THAT'S WHEN YOU GO SEE OUR DOCTOR BUT THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER BIT THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND A LOT OF TIMES WILL SEE COUPLES WHO HAVE MISS MATCH LEBIDOS NOT DOS TOT MEAN ONE PERSONS RIGHT IN ONE PERSON IS WRONG NO IT JUST THE MATTR IF LIKE WELL HOW DO YOU IF YOU WANT IT COME TO A POINT WHERE YOU AGREE HOW DO WE GET THERE YOU KNOW AND WHAT IS WHAT IS YOUR ENCLE I LEADER WILL TALK A A BIT MORE ABOUT CHEMISTRY WHICH I FIND INFINITELY FASCINATING BECAUSE IN MY LIFE EXPERIENCE I'VE JUST BEEN STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT OCCASIONALLY YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL INTERACTION WITH SOMEWONE SOMETIMES IS NOT EVEN PHYSICAL INTERACTION AND THEY ARE JUST SO UNBELIEVABLY AROUSING TO YOU OR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN OR SOMETIMES IT IT JUST SORT OF AIN'T THERE ORS JUST NOT THERE ARE THAT MUCH OR NOBODY LIKES TO TALK ABOUT THIS OR IT'S THERE UNTIL YOU SLEEP TOGETHER AND THEN IT'S NOT THERE AND THIS IS ALL NOT JUST PUT ON MALES THIS IS PUT ON FEMALES I IA I HOPE SHE IESN'T KILL ME FOR SAYING THIS I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS A FAMILY MEMBER WHO ONCE SAID SOMETIMES YOU AFETER REALIZING NEVER WANT OF SLEEP WITH SOMEBODY AGAIN BY SLEEPING WITH THEM AND HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING BOUT DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE RIGT RIGHT SI YOU KNOW AGAIN THAT THISCUSHERMAN LIBITO AS YOU O SO APPTLY POINT IT DOUBT ENGAGING WHAT IS HEALTHY LEVELS OF LEBE DON'T HAS A LOUGHT TO DO WITH WHAT ONE SELF DESIRES AS WELL AS THE HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SEXTUALLY NVALLEDWORTH SO WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT  IT LATER IN THE CONTECT OF CEMISTRY CAUSE I FIND IT' SO FASCINATING AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT UM LET'S GET BACK TO FEMALE SECTUAL ROUSAL RESPONDETAN NDASL SO PHYSIOLOGICALLY WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BODY IS THAT PREPARES FOR PENETRATION NOW THAT COULD BE PENUS THAT COULD BE A SEXTOY THAT COULD BE A DIGIT FINGER A TO BE MORE SPECIFIC SO IT WHAT IT DOES IS THE SERVICS MOOTHS UP AND OUT OF THE WAY THAT THE INNER ONE THIRD TWO THORDS OF THE VIGINA LENGTHENS AND A LONGATES TO ALLOW FOR PENETRATION AND IT CAN ACTUALLY DOUBLE NEARLY DOUBLE IN SIZE OF THAT OF THE BASELINE FASINAL LENGTH AND SO IT IS PREPARING FOR THAT SO IF YOU AND SO THAT'S PART OF IT IN SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PAINFUL INTERCOURSE IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD ADEQUATE TIME FOR AROUSAL AND SO THERE THE PENISTS PENETRATING BEFORE THEY'VE HAD THOSE ADAPTATIONS TO OCCUR AND ALSO THE LABBEA OPEN UP TO ALLOW FOR THAT PENETRATIONS OF THESE THINGS T ACTUALLY HAPPEN PHYSIO LOGICALLY TO ALLOW FOR PREPARATION SO WHILE SOME PEOPLE MAY BE AROUSED AND GET TO THAT POINT QUICKER SOME PEOPLE DO NEED A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OF WHAT AS YOU DESCRIBED FOR PLAY AND NOT EVERYONE IS THE SAME BUT THING ITS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PARTNER AND YOU KNOW LUBRICATION IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE ASSESS AROUSAL BUT THAT'S NOT THE BE ALL AND ALL SOME PEOPLE JUST MAKE A LOT OF LUBRICATION AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T AND SERTAINLY THAT CHANGES WITH AGE AND HARMONS SO IF A CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT AFTER MEN A PAUSE WITH A DROP IN ESTROGEN AND TESTASTRONE YOU WILL SEE A DECREASE IN LUBRICATION AND SOMETIMES IF PEOPLE ARE ON MEDICATIONS THAT CAN ALTER THEIR HARMONAL ACCESS THEY MAY ALSO SEE CHANGES IN LUBRICATION AFTER DURING BRAST FEEDING UCAN SEE CHANGES IN LUBRCATION AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT A THEY'RE NOT AROUSED NECESSARILY THIS IS LIKE A PHYSIOLOGIC PROBLEM THAT THEY'R HAVING CAN WE ISTINGUISH BETWEEN AROUSAL BASED LUBRICATION THE AY SEXUAL AROUSAL BASED LUBRICATION A GAIN FOLKS FOR GIVE ME FOR BEING SO HYPER SPECIFICATE LANGUAGE BUT THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF AROUSAL BESIDES SEXUAL ROUSAL THAT A WE KNOW FROM IT'S NOT A PLEASANT TOPIC FROM AM REPORTS OF FALLING SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES A THE VICTIM IS DEMONIZED FOR HAVING BEEN A LUBRICATED AND THEY WILL SAY WELL THEN PEOPLE WILL PRESUME THAT SOMEHOW THEY WANTED THAT INTERACTION AND THAT'S NOT TRUE IN THOSE CASES IT'S CLEAR THAT THOSE THAT THE LUBRICATION OCCURRED INDEPENDENT OF LABIDO TYPE AROUSAL EXACTI OCA SO LET'S SET THAT ASIDE AGAIN UNPLEASANT TOPIC BUT ONE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO TO ATEMPT TO FLAG OR THERE FORMS OF NON LABIDO TYPE AROUSAL LUBRICATION THAT ALLOW FOR NON PAINFUL OR EVEN PLEASUREFUL PENETRATION THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH FROM THE AROUSAL BASE LUBRICATION IN OTHER WORDS I HAVE TO IMAGINE AM THAT WOMEN WILL HALF SEX AND IT CAN BE PLEASUREFUL ERE T LEASE NOT PAINFUL AND THAT MIGHT RELATE IN SOME WAY TO BASELINE LEVELS OF LUBRICATION AND HERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING BOUT LUBRICATION A MAINLING THE CONTECTS OF AROUSAL O POSTMEN APOZLE REDUCTIONS IN LUBRICATION BUT ARE THERE ALSO POSTMEN APOZL REDUCTIONS IN BASE LINE LUBRICATION ARE SOME PEOPLE'S VIGIAN IS JUST MORE LUBRICATED AT UM I MUST THEY AT REST AS LIKE THE SCIENTIST IN ME OM WHEN AM THEIRE SLEEP FOR INSTANCE I MEAN MEN ARE HAVING ERECTIONS IN THEIR SLEEP ARE WOMEN GETTING VAGINAL LUBRICATIONS IN THEIR SLEEP PERIODICALLY MY GUESSES YES WHILE THEY'RE DEAFLY GETTING CLITERAL AND AN ENGORAGEMENT RIGHT THEY'RE ETTING CLEARLIN GUARGEMEN THERE AS BEEN SOMESTUDIES ON THAT THAT THEY ARE ALSO GETING NOCTURNAL TO MESSENS RIGHT JUST LIKE MEN DO AS FAR AS LUBRICATION YOU KNOW THAT THE DATA AT LEAST FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAN IS LIKE THERE IS A PROTECTIVE MACCANIS THEM WHEREBY WOMEN WHEN WHEN THERE'S ANY SENSE THAT THERE MAY BE PENETRATION THAT THEIR BODY WILL IMMEDIATELY START CREATING LUBRECATION AND THAT IS PRODECTIVE TO AVOID YOU DONT TROMA AND INJURY THERE'S ALSO BASELINE FAGIONAL DISCHARGE THAT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL WOMEN WILL MAKE PHYSIOLOGIC DISCHARG IN FACT IN OUR EXAMINATIONS WHEN WE EXAMINE ONE WILL SAY NORMAL PHYSIOLOGIC DISCHARGE BECAUSE WE SEE IT THERE'S ALWAYS DISCHARGE AND IT IS A IT CAN BE UP TO LIKE FIVE MILLIAARS AND SO IT'S NOT A SMALL AMOUNT IT CAN HAPPEN E ME QUITE A LOT THE NACE MENSTRUAL PCYCLE DEPENDENT IN TERMS OF THOF ISCOSITY AN YES IT CHANGES OVER THI PCYCLE AND IT CAN BE DIFFERENT IN COLOR AND DIFFERENT IN THICKNESS AND THAT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL AND I THINK THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM IN THE FAMINEINE HYDING INDUSTRY A YOU DON'T NEED TO SMELL A CERTAIN WAY OR OR REDUCE THAT DISCHARGE THIS IS LIKE COMPLETELY NORMAL HEALTHY AND YOU TALKED ABOUT CEMISTRY AND I KNOW THERE'S LIKE NOT A CONNEDATE ON THIS THISIC FARIMAL ANS RIGHT THEIR SENSE THAT ARE COMING FROM YOU WHICH ARE ACTUALLY ATTRACTIVE TO A PARTNER POTENTIALLY AND AND IN WHATEVER PHYSIOLOGIC OUKNOW I DON'T KNOW THIESKNOWLEDGE TA DAT ONTIS BUT LIKE THERE IS THAT PART OF IT SEL A YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF MARKETING TOWARDS WOMEN THAT YOUR DIRTY YOU SHOULD BE SMELLING LIKE PEACHES OR WHATEVER THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MARKET A I MAY BE THIS AS GENERATIONAL THING BUT I LEARNED EARLY ON MA THINK BY BEHAVIAL NO SCINCE COURSES THAT VAGINAL LUBRICATIONS WERE A PART OF THE AROUSAL RESPONSE FOR BOTH A THESE WERE ALWAYS FRAMED IN THE CONTECTS OF HATERAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT BOTH PARTNERS LENDIS IN BOTH PARTNERS A MECAUSE TIS COUND BE A AMOSEXUAL FEMALE RELATIONSHIP TOOIT WE WANTA   MAKE THE CONVERSATION IS BROUGHD AS POSSIBLE A AND THAT THE A ODOR WHAT'S JUST BE FRANK HERE A THE ODOR AND THE TASTE A PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH AROUSAL BUT ALSO THE PERABONDING RESPONSE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH FUTURE AROUSAL AND ANY ONE THAT'S EVER BEEN IN A A IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT A WHAT'S EY HAD HEALTHY SECUAL A RELATIONS I LIKE TO THINK IS EXPERIENCE A REMEMBERING SOMEBODY SMELL ER THINK ABOUT SOMEBOY SMELL AND THAT ITSELF CO BE VERY ROUSING YES PARTNERS EVEN I'M SMELLING OF DIFFERENT ARTICLES OF EACH OTHER'S CLOTHING NAT THING AROUSING  THIS IS THE STUFF OF OF REAL PHYSIOLOGY WE'RE NOT WERE NOT MAKING THE STUFF ALL RIGHT BUT THERE IS THERE IS A LOT OF MARKETING TOWARDS WOMEN THAT THEY SHOULD USE DUSHING OR OTHER THINGS TO CLEAN THEMSELVES AND IT IS IT'S DAMAGING RIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY ONE IT CAN AFFECT THE VASNA MICHROBIUMS O THEIR PAGES CHANGING AND THAT CAN EFFECT YOU KNOW THEY'RE RISK FOR UTIIS OR BACTUREL VAGANOSIS AND A AND AND SO THERE THE'RE BUYIND THESE SPENDING THEIR MONEY ON TESE THINGS BECAUSETHEY'RE BEING TOLD THAT THEY'RE NOT CLEAN AND THEY COME TO THE DOCTORS THING OH IM YOU KNOW I THINK I HAVE ASTITY BUT IT'S LIKE NORMAL PHYSIOLOGIC DISCHARGE A AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS NORMAL AND AND IT'S NORMAL TO HAVE AN ODOUR THAT IS DISDAIN TO YOU AND THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW OF COURSE IF YURE LIKE A FISHY ODOR THAT MAY BE A SIGN OF  LIKE A VERY STRONG NEW NOVEL ODOR THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE THAT MAY BE A SIGN OF A SECTUALLY TRANSMITTED IN FACTION BUT IF IT'S YOUR GENERAL ODOR THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD THAT'S NORMAL WHONE ABOUT OTHER INFECTIONS LIKE EAST RNFECTIONS OR BECTURIAL INFECTIONS OF THE AGOT NUMBER OF QUECTIONS ABOUT MICHAEL PLASMO OM INFECTIONS WHICH AND WE DON'T HEAR THAT OFTEN ABOUT BUT  YES YOUYOU CAN SEE IF YOUR DISCHARGE HAS CHANGED AN BECOME MORE LIKE COTTAGE CHEESE LIKE OR THERE IS A MENO IT OTHERS SYMPTEMS LIKE ITCHING A OR DISCOMFORT THEN YOU KNOW THOSE ARE SIGNS TO GO GET A VALUATED A MICHAEL PLASMAIS ANOTHER INFECTION THAT WE SEE IN THE VIGINA BUT WE ALSO ACTUALLY SOMETIMES SEE IN THE EARING AND WHILE IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ROUTENLY TASSED FOR WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SYMPTOMS OF YOU'RE IN ARTRACT INFECTION AND THEY'RE NOT IMPROVING SOMETIMES TWHE WILL CHECK FOR MICHAEL PLASMA THAT COULD BE CAUSING SYMETIMS IN THE EURETHREADSELF A THAT A COUPLE EPISODES ABOUT THE GUT MICHROBIUM I COLLY JUST IN SONUNBUR ET STAMFORD IS LOVETORS DIRECTLY ABOVE FRMIS EXPERN AGOUT MICROBIOM DONE A COUPLE OPISODES ABOUT THIS AND AM HE REMINDED ME AND I LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT A EVERY MUCOSAL LINING OF YOUR BODY HAS A ROBOST MICROBIUMS THAT MEANS INTRENASAL AND TRUE VATIONAL INTRY OURETHROL IN A MALES AND FEMALES AM HERE'S AN ANAL MICROBIOM THERE'S A MICROBIUM ON YOUR SKIN ON YOUR EYES AM AND YOU MENTION DUCING AN OTHER A IN OTHER WAYS OF I SAY QUOT ICL CLEANING IT BECAUSE THAT LANGUAGE FALLS IN LINE WITH THE IDEA THAT IT'S A GOOD THING YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S IT'S IT'S A BAD THING IN MANY CASES AM BECAUSE WIPING OUT THE MICROBIOM WHAT ER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT A FEMALES CAN DO IN ORDER TO A PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THEIR VAGENAL MICROBIOM SO IT'S IT'S REALLY  OUR BODIES ARE AMAZING THE VIGINA IS A SELF CLEANING OF IN YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING YOU JUST LOT  THE VIGINA IS A SELF CLEANING  A MUCKITOR  NO CIN TO REPEAT THAT TOO OFTEN INTO MA DIFFERENT CONTECTS WEN' REMEMBER IT FOREVER YOU WELL YOU AND THE ALL YOU NEEN TO DO IS WASH THE HAIR BEARING ARIES BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT CREAT THWEAT AND AND AND SHOULD BE CLEANED BUT OTHERS AN THAT LET SOAPY WATER RUN DOWN OWNING TO DO ANYTHING YOUR BODY WILL TAKE CARE OF IT ITSELF WHEN ELSE FIVE YEARS OLD I PULL MY PARENTS IN THE BATHROOM AND I SAID THEY STILL TALK ABOUT THIS I SAID I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT SAX I WONT KNOW EVERYTHING AND THEY WELE LIKE ALL MY GOT WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH AND I'LL NEVER FORGET MY DAGIS LOOK TAT ME HE'S ARGENTINE HE SAID JUST REMEMBER CAUSE OF THE ONE THING IN LIFE YOU CAN'T GIVE BACK THAT'S ALL  I THAT WAS IT THAT HAT THAT WAS IT O GASH  WY YOU MY DISCUSSION OFH MY SONS ARE MY SON MY ELDER SON HAS BEEN MUCH MORE GRAPHIC THAN THAT I TELL IT IS A MASIN WELL  WENT OU INTO THE WORLAN E ANYWAY A YO FIGURED IT OUT LET'S SPEND A FEW MINUTES OR MORE TALKING ABOUT FEMALE ORGASM ONE OF THE MORE CRYPTIC TOPICS ON THE INTERNETTE NOT BECAUSE IT ISN'T DISGUST BUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE NEW ANTS OF IT ISN'T DISGUSSED OFTEN ENOUGH OR IN FULL DEPTH SO LET'S TAKE THE TIME WE NEED AM TO PARSE THIS I THINK THAT THE SIMPLEST WAY TO PARSE IT IS GOING TO BE FROM THE ANATOMICAL STANDPOINT CLITERAL ORGAISM VERSES SO CALLED CEA SPOT OR PENETRATION BASED ORGANISM BUT OF COURSE PENETRATION BASED ORGAISM IS ALSO A BIT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE A THERE CAN BE A CLITERAL STIMULATION BY PELVIC PRESSURER OR BY DIGIT WRETTI BOUT FINGERS AS DIGITS BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH AM IN THE MEDICAL SLASH SCIENCE PROFESSION BUT WHECH IME AT FINGERS HERE OR SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT FIBRATOR TOY WHATEVER AM TO FOR A DEPENDS ON FLEXIBLE YOUARE I DON'T KNOW BUT THE POINT BEING AM THAT I THINK THE SIMPLEST WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS IS GOING TO BE TO TALK ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLITERAL ORGANISM AND CEA SPOT ORGANISM HOWEVER THOSE ARE ACHIEVED AM AND TO ALSO TALK ABOUT THIS IDEA OF GRATEDVERSES ABSOLUTE O CASSO ATIS HAS ACTUAL PARALLELS TO NARROW SCIENCE WHERE WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EIR ONS BEING GRATED MEANING IT'S KIND OF EU ONE LEVEL THAN A HIGHER LEVEL THAN LOWER LEVEL ERE ALL AR NON RIGHT AM HOW SHALL I SAY THIS AM IT IS CLEAR IN MY LIFE EXPERIENCE IN OBSERVATION THAT THERE ARE MULTIBLE KINDS OF FEMALE ORGANISM THOSE THAT ARE GRATED AND IN SOME CASES CUMULATIVE THEY SORT OF BUILD TOWARDS A LARGER AND LARGER ORGANISM AND THEN THERE ARE WHAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED AS CLIFF TYPE ORGANISMS WHERE THERE'S A REFRACTORY PERIOD I THINK THAT'S A FAIR WAY TO FRAME THIS AND CLEARLY THERE ARE DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO THE ORGANISM RESPONSE SOME PEOPLE GET SLEEPY SOME PEOPLE GET ENERGIZED SOME PEOPLE IT HEIGHTENS THEIR DESIRE FOR MORE SOME PEOPLE THEY NEED A A A PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH AM THEY BECOME HYPER SENSITIVE TO TOUCH AM SO A LOTS OF DIFFREN THINGS GOING ON THERE AM PSYCHOLOGICALLY PHYSIOLOGICALLY AM YET TELL US ALL OF IT TO IN TERMS OF ORGAASM MIG I THINK IT IN FPOINT TO DISTINGUISH THAT THERE IS ORGASM AND THE N THERE'S DIFFERENT AREAS THAT YOU STIMULATE TO ACHIEVE ORGASM SO SOME PEOPLE WILL STIMULATE THE CLITERUS IS PROBABLY THE MOST RELIABLE FORM OF STIMULATION THAT WILL ACHIEVE ORGASM AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND AGAIN YOU KNOW FEMALE SEXUAL IS FUNCTIONY OES NOT SUPER ROBUST BUT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PER SCENT OF WOMEN REQUIRE CLITERAL STIMULATION OR TO CLIMAX SO VERY FEW ACTUALLY CLIMAXS THROUGH JUST VASONAL PENETRATION ALONE AND SO THIS IS YOU KNOW A REAL PROBLEM WE'RE SEEING ON THE MEDIA THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE SACKS AND YOU PENETRATE AND MEALE WOMEN ARE HAVING ORGASMS THAT'S NOT THE REALITY FOR A LOT OF WOMEN AND IN TERMS OF STIMULATION SO LIKE WEE TALKED AGHOUT THROUGHOUT THIS PODCAS THE CLITERUS IS THE HOMALOGUE OF THE PENUS OR THE PIECEAS THE HOMALOGUEOF THE CLIERUS HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY IT I DON'T YOU FORGETTING IT BOTH DIRECTION YEICOERS THREW THAT ONE UP YESO A SO CLITERAL STIMULATIN IS JUST LIKE PENA STIMULATION FOR WOMEN THAT IS VERY RELIABLE AND THERE'S A HUGE ORGASM GAP FOR MEN IT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT THAT WHEN THEY HAVE A FIRST TIME SEXUAL ENCOUNTER NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF MEN ARE HAVING AN ORGASM WE LOOK AT FIRST TIME SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS FOR WOMEN WITH IN HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS IT'S ABOUT FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY PER CENT ARE HAVING AN ORGASM AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOLMOSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS OF WOMEN IT'S AGAIN NINETY PER CENT SO THERE'S CLEARLY SOME LACKING IN NINE YOU PER CENT OF OM FEMALE HOMOSEXUAL INTERACTIONS THAT AR FIRST TIME INTERACTIONS NINETY PER CENT OR HAVING ORGASM CORRECT RIS ONLY BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE ANTEMY OF OTHER BY WAY OF UNDERSTANG THENATEMY OF SO O THERE'S A HUGE AGASIOLOGY ON PSYCHOLOGY OH YES THAT'S BUT TH O THERE'S A HUGE GAP THERE AND SO I THINK TO TO BRING AT HOME IS THAT CLITERAL STIMULATION IS THE MOST RELIABLE WAY AND AS YOU MENTIONED WHEN YOU'R STIMULATING VASUALLY YOU'RE OFTEN THE CLIERUS IS LIKE A WISHBONE AND IT GOES AROUND THE VIGINA AND SO YOU'RE OFTEN STIMULATING THOSE THE CURA IS WHAT WE CALL THE LEG ES I GUESS FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM OF THE CLITERUS AND SO YOURE STIMULING THAT YOU'R ALSO STIMULING THE CLIP THE CLITERAL SHAFT WHICH GOES DEEP INTO THE PALVIS THE G SPOT IS A IS AN AREA AS NAROGENOUS ZOWN WHERE IT'S KIND OF THE ANTERE WALL THE VIGINA BUT TWO TO THREE SENIMETERS TIN THAT'S THE LOCATION OF THESE PARIOR RETRAL GLANDS CALLED THE SCHENE'S GLANCE AND THEY ARE ANOLOGOUS OR HOMOLOGUS TO THE MALE PROSTATE SO JUST LIKE SOME MEN HAVE PROSTATE PLAY AND ENJOY PLEASURE FROM PROSTATE STIMULATION SOME WOMEN ENJOY G SPOT STIMULATION NOW THT'S NOT UNIVERSAL RIGHT NOT ALL MEN ENJOY PROSTATE PLAY AND NOT ALL WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE AROUSED BY G SPOT STIMULATION AND SO I THINK THERE'S A HUGE A HUGE VARIETY OF WAYS YOU CAN STIMULATE WITH STIMULATE ANY ONE IT CAN BE MAN OR WOMEN SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE ORGASM THROUGH JUST NIPPL STIMULATION ALONE SOME WILL JUST HERE SOMETHING OR TSEE SOMETHING AND BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE AN ORGASM AND IT'S IT'S SO VARIED FROM PERSON TO PERSON AND I THINK THAT THE BIG TAKE COME FROM THIS FOR PEOPLE LISTENING IS LIKE YOU HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR PARTNER AND THIS IS THE HARDESTHING WE NEVER LEARNED HOW TO TALK ABOUT SEX LIKE WHAT DO YOU LIKE WHAT DO YOU NOT LIKE AND AND DON'T TAKE AT PERSONALLY RIGHT LIKE I THINK A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE FEEL LIKE YOU HALF TO ORGAASM TO HAVE PLEASURE WHICH MAY NOT BE THE CASE FOR EVERYBODY A AND IF IT IS YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE THAT FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP SO ON IF I GOT OFF TRACK THERE BUT THAT'S KIND OF A I THINK THE THE TAKE COMBS FOR THIS AND ALSO THE VAGINAL PENETRATION IT'S ACTUALLY USUALLY FROM CERVICAL STIMULATION NOT NECESSARILY VAGINAL BECAUSE THE LARGE DENSITY OF INERVATION THE VIGINA IS THE FIRST OUTER THIRD OF THE VIGINA THERE THE DEEPER TWO THIRDS OF THE IGINA HAS AS MUCH LESS INTERVATION AND YET THERE IS SUCH A THING AS ERVICAL ORGAN SO AND THE SERVITH BEING FURTHER UP T THE VAGINAL CANAL A IS SERVICAL ORGASM SPECIFICALLY THE THE STIMULATION ANAC A THE FOSI OF AN ORGASM THAT STARTS IN THE BACK OF THE VIGINA IS A YES THOTS FROM STIMULATION OF THE SERVIX THROUGH WHATEVER MEANS TRIGT AN THAT CAN BE PLEASURABLE AND W LEAD TO ORGASM AND AGAIN ORGAASM YOU KNOW IS IS DEFINED DIFFERENTLY RED BUT THE ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT THERE ARE PALVIC FLOR CONTRACTIONS WHICH ARE MEASURABLES TAT YOU CAN KIND OF TELL THAT YOUR PARTNER IS HAVING AN ORGASM IF YOU HAVE A FEMALE PARTNER BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THOSE CONTRACTION THRIGHT WHEATHER IT'S ON HER DIDGIT OR OUR ORGAN OR SEXTWAY  SUPERNURTY QUESTION HERE AM YEARS AGO WHEN I WORKED ON HORMON BASEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION OF WHICH BY THE WAY WE'E DONE IT AEPISODE THE POCAST ON PREVIOUSLY AM A YOU KNO LEARN THAT THE LEVATOR ANY MUSCLE AM IS THE MUSCLE THE CONTROLS ERECTION AND MALES AND PRESUME THE A CLITERAL TOMASSINSAND IN AN INGORGEMENT IN FEMALES IS THERE AN EQUIVALENT MUSCLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORGASM RESPONSE OR IS THE CONTRACTION OF THE PELVIC FLOOR ON PART OF A MORE GENERAL THEME OF AF MUSCULAR CONTRACTION AND A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT OF NERVE ROOTS CONTRACTING THE REASON I ASKE THIS IS THAT EVENTUALLY IN THIS CONVERSATION WERE GTNTO MIGRATE UP TOWARD THE BRAIN BUT BECAUSE HIS IS A SCIENCE AND HEALTH PODCAST WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ORGAASM OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT AS THEIR EXPERIENCE OF IT AND THER RECOGNITION OF IT IN OTHER PEOPLE AM AND DESCRIPTIONS ET CETERA BUT A ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A RESPONSE THAT ORIGINATES AT A FOSIE AM CONPLICIN A IN THE BRAIN WE TALK ABUT A SEIZURE BAT OU NO STARTING AT A FOCUS OF FOSIN THEN SPREADING OUT AM OR WE TALKING ABOUT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT NERVE ROOTS AND BRAIN CENTERS FIRING IN SYNCRANY AND THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IT AS YOU KNOW BEHIND THEIR FOREHEAD AND IN THEIR GENEALS TE AER AS A WHOLE BODY RESPONSE AND E ERE WE'RE NOT TELLING ABOUT THE FLOOD OF OF NERROW CHEMICALS INTO THE BODY I'M TOLIG ABOUT DURING THOSE MOMENTS OF WORGASM AM WHAT IS HAPPENING NAUROLLY I MEAN IT DOES HAVE CERTAIN P WELL'S TO SEIZURE RI OS DOES SO LET ME GO BACK TO YOUR FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION WHICH WAS A ABOUT ORGAASM AND SARE ERECTION AND TWO MESSONS BEING LIT THE LEVATOR ANICE SO ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE REASON YOU GET IN ERECTION AND PRESUME WY CLITOL STIMULATION THE SAME WAYS BLOOD FLOWS INTO THE ERECTILE TISSUE AND THE TUNICA WHICH IS THE OUTER LAYERS OF THE OF THE SH OF THE ERECT TILE TISSUE WHICH ARE TOO BASILY CYLINDRICAL SHAPE STRUCTURES IN THE PENUS AND IN THE CLITERIS THEY WILL FILL WITH BLOOD AND TO THAT TUNICA WILL COMPRESS VEINS ON THE OUTSIDE TO PREVENT LOD FOR FROM LEAVING SOS NOT A MUSCULAR EVENT IS AN ACTUAL BLOOD FLOW EVENT THE HOWCOME WHEN WE WANTED TO STUDY ERECTION BEHAVIOR IN RODANCE WE WOULD OM GIVE THEM INJECTIONS OF TOSTOSTRON FEMALES OR MALS AND OBSERVE CHANGES IN SECUAL BEHAVIOR ACCORDINGLY ERECTION AND CLITERAL TOMESCENCE ALL THO'S HARGER HARDER IMEASURE IN RODINC TEREIS A WAY OF INDIRECTLY MEASURING THAT AND THEN WE WOULD MEASURE THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE LEVITOR ANY MUSCLES AS A REDOUBT OF HOW INDRITERNIZED THAT WHOLE SYSTEM WAS ETTHEM WELL OU KNOW WE HAVE WHAT IS THE ROLE OF LAATOR ANY IN IN THE SEXUAL RTHELEVATOR A I  I THINY LE VARRING WHEN YOU AN NOY I SILLY SO THOSE MUSCLES ARE PART OF THE PALVIC FLOOR RIGHT AND SO THOSE CONTRACT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CLIMAX RIGHT SO WEATHER IT'S ORGAISM FROM MALE AR FUMALE THERE CONTRACTING AND THEIR EXERCISING WRIGHT THERE GET SO THAT'S HOW THEY WOULD INCREASE THER THEIR STRENGTH ARE THEIR DENSITY OM IF YOU'RE MEASURING THAT THROUGH THE ACTUAL CLIMAX OF WHICH YOU CAN'T SEE IN ROANS RIGHT SO LIKE YOUR KIND OF USING AS A CERGIT IN THAT WAY A SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THOSE MUSCLES CONTRACT AS A RESPONSE AND CLIMAX IS A BRAIN INITIATED OF TAN ORGANAISM AS A BRAIN INITIATED EVENT SO THAT'S WHY TO ANSWER YOUR SECOND PART YOU OVASSY FEEL FOCAL RESPONSE BUT YOU ALSO CAN FEEL A VARIETY OF RESPONSES CUS ALL COME NG FROM THE BRAIN IT'S NOT A KIND OF THTHE WA DESCRIBED IT AS LIKE A RIPPLE A FACT A IT'S MORE LIKE A IT IT'S THE WAY YOUR BODY RESPONSE IN THAT PARTICULAR STIMULI AND IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE THE ULTIMATE FORM OF MINDFULNESS YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE WHEN YOUR ORGANASM ING RIGHT SO IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE THIS MOMENT OF CLARITY AND AND EVERY AND AND EVERYTHING YOU ARE VERY PRESENT IN THAT MOMENT AND SO PEOPLE WILL FEEL DIFFERENT STIMULATIONS DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW HOW THEIRE HOW THEY KIND OF HOW THER SENSOR  OF THEIR NERVES ARE THEIR SENSATIONS AREN'T THINGS LIKE THAT A HIS PERHAPS A GOOD TIME TO A MENTIONED DOPENING WE TALKS ABOUT A FEW TIMES A EARLIER WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE AROUSAL ARC THAT STARTS WITH PARIS SYMPATHETIC SORT OF CALM AND THEN AM MOVE TYPICALLY STARTS AS CALM AND THEN MOVES TO AM THE ORGASM RESPONSE WE KNOW THAT THE ORGANASM RESPONSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH RELEASE OF DOPENING A AND THEN PROLACTON WHICH SETS UP THE RELATIVE OR ABSOLUTE REFACTORY PREDE THE A THE INTERESTING THING AND I GOT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS IS THAT AM THERE'S LITERATURE AS I UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE ELEVATION IN DOPENING CAUSE BY SAY ANTA DEPRESSONS LIKE WELL BUTRON BROPRIRON WHICH INCREASES DOPENING AN NORUP IN EFFERON AM PEOPLE WHO RECREATIONALLY USE DRUGS LIKE COCANE WERE OTHER STIMULANTS AM PEOPLE WHO TAKE AM ATERAL VIVANTS OR OTHER DRUGS THAT INCREASE A LEVELS OF DOPENING BECAUSE I DID HOLE EPISODE ABOUT THOSE DRUGS AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ANPHETAMING UNLESSWE TALK ABOUT RIDDLE AND WHICH A SLOWA DIFFERENT AAND I GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE FEELING A LOT OF A DESIRE SEF AROUSAL BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE A PHYSICAL ROUSAL ERECTION OR VAGINAL LUBRICATION SO IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY'RE SITTING FURTHER ALONG THAT AROUSAL ART HENCE THE IMPORTANCE I THINK OF A PEOPLE LEARNING G TO HAVE ACALM A STATES OF MIND WHEN GOING INTO SEXUAL INTERACTIONS NOW I REALIZE THAT IN SAYING THAT IT MIGHT BE CONFUSING BCAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK LE THAT THITS ANYTHING BUT CALM RIGHT SEXUAL ROUSALS ANYTHING BUT CALM BUT MAINTAINING ENOUGH CALM THAT THEY CAN A RIDE THAT ARK A FOR WHATEVER DURATION IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT INTERACTION IN THEM RIKEERS AGAIN WHEN WE SHURRAILY GET BACK TO THIS YOU KNOW A YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE SEX FOR LONG PRUIDS OF TIME SOME FOR SHORTER PERIODS OF TIME AND HERE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING EXCEPT BY WAY OF PORNOGRAPHIAN AND SELF REPORT AND DISCUSSION SO AM IS IT THE CASE THAT DRUGS THAT INCREASE DOPENING CAN INHIBIT THE SEXUAL RESPONSE DO THEY TEND TO PROMOTE THE SEXUAL RESPONSE BECAUSE I ALSO MENTIONED EARLYER THEIRE IS A GROWING TREND OF PEOPLE TAKING BY WAY OF PRESCRIPTION OF COURSE FROM A PHYSICION AM COMBINED APLE MORPHINE WHICH IS A DOPAMINERGIC DRUG A WITH TO DALLAFILL WHICH IS A A PETY FIVE INHIBITOR SO ITS CAN INCREASE BLOOD FLOW AND I'M HEARING ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN BUT MAINLY MEN DOING THIS SO RAMPEN UP THEIR DOPENING A RAMPING UP THEIR BLOOD FLOW TO THEIR GENITALS IN ORDER TO HAVE PRESUME WE MORE AROUSAL IN SEX DOES IT MAKE SENSE AN A YES O AS A MECHANISM YES SO IN TERMS OF APRIL MARFIN A THE THAT HAS BEEN STUDY AND ITS BULSELY BEEN APPROVED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES SO WE DON'T USE IT VERY OFTEN HERE IN THE UNITESTATES THAT HASN'T BEEN AFTY APPROVED A BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY COMPLEX RESPONSE  LIKE I MENTION THAT A FLABANCER AND WHICH IS ESSENTUALLY ACTING THAT OCCASION IT ACTUALLY HAS NOT ONLY A INHIBITORY AND NOT ONLY STIMULA TORY BUT ALS WEN HIBATORY OF FACTS ON DOPA MEANS O THE WAY IT SORT OF WORKS TO ENHANCE INTEREST OR LIBIDO ITS SORT OF COMPLEX AND KIND OF CONFUSING WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY APPROVED IT WAS IT WAS BEING STUDIED FOR AN ANTI DEPRESENT AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT WOMEN WERE ACTUALLY HAVING LEE NO BETTER A INTEREST IN SACTS AR MORE INTEREST IN SACTSONS OF THAT KIND OF HOW IT WAS DISCO VERD SIMILARLY VIAGARA WAS ACTUALLY STUDIED FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND WHEN THEY WENT TO AM IT WAS HORRIBLE BLOOD PASSURA MEDICATION BUT THEN THE PEOPLE THE MEN WHO TOOK IT ACTUALY DIDN'T RETURN THE SAMPLES BUT THE STUDY SO THEY REALIZED THAT CLE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AND IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING BETTER ERECTION IS IT TRUE THAT A AT SOME EUROLOGY MEETING THAT THE FIRST AM DESCRIPTION OF BIAGARA'S TREATMENT FOR A MERTALIS FUNCTION INVOLVED THE SPEAKER ACTUALLY COMING OUT FROM BEHIND THE PODIUM AND REVEALING HIS ERRECTION IS THAT A TRUE STORY YES I DON'T THINK IT WAS BAGAR I THINK IT WASN'T INTRIC CAVERNOSAL INJACTION NOW I THINK HE CAME OU A IT IS THE TRUTH RATHERE'S ACTUALLY A PUBLISH ARCLE I'LL SEND IT TO YOU SO YOU CAN SHARE IT IF HE LIKED IN METRALEST TAT A I'LL READ THE ARTICLE THERE'S A PUBLISHED ARTICLE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WERE ATTENDING AT THE MEETING AND YES HE CAME OUT AND AT THE TIME LIKE IT WAS MOSTLY MAN IN EUROLOGY BUT THERE WERE LIKE SPAUSES I GUESS IN THE AUDIENCE WHICH IS NOT TYPICAL NOW BUT A SO THERE WERE WOMEN IN THE AUDIENCE AND HE CAME OUT WITH THE PHILONERACTION TO SHOW THAT IT HE NOW IN FACT WELL I SUPPOSE AT THE EUROLOGY MEETING AM OR WEG WHIN MEETING WHERE A ONE COMES OUT IN REVEALS HER A INHANSE OF AGINAL LIBRICATION THAN WEILL HAVE A WEL HAVE A GENDER IN SEXS BALANCE AT THE MEETINGS ON EUROLOGY AM  BE INTERESTING TO ATTEND ONE OF THUS SOME DAY AM DIFFERENCES IN AROUSAL AS A FUNCTION OF STAGE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS I DID ALONG EPOSODE ON FERTILITY AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FEW OTHER I V F EXPERTS A FERTILITY EXPERTS ON THE PAD CAST AM BUT CLEARLY AM THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HORMONS ACROSS HE MINSTRUAL CYCLE WE KNOW THAT FOR SHORE YE AM CLEARLY THERE CAN BE PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIATION ACCORDING TO THOSE FOREMONSTS WERE PRUBLY OTHER THINGS ACROSS THE MINSTRUAL CYCLE AND IT'S ALWAYS AN IMPERFECT EXPERIMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE AREN'T LABORATORY RATS AND PEOPLE ARE HAVING DIFFERENT INTERRACTIONS ACROSS THE MINSTRUAL CYCLE IS THERE ANY KNOWN AM CORRELATION BETWEEN A DESIRE AND STAGE THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE THERE'S SOME OBVIOUS A ASSUMPTIONS THAT ONE MIGHT MAKING A PRIOR T OVULATION ET CETERA AROUND THE TIME OF OBDATION A BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER DIRECTION TO A IS THERE CATEGORY OF WOMEN THAT ARE VERY INTERESTED IN SECTS AT CERTAIN STAGES OF THE MENSTRAL CYCLE AND THEN NOT AT ALL INTERESTIN SECTS AN OTHER STAGES THE MENTRUAL CYCLE WE KNOW THAT ALL THAT I  DATED THA I'VE HEARD AND MAYBE A GAN CLOGES COULD SPEAK MORE ON THIS THEY STUDY THOSE VARIATIONS A LITTLE BETTER BUT THERE IS DATA TO SUGGEST THAT LEBIDO DOES INCREASE PRIOR TO OVULATION AND DURING OVULATION ANDTING IT THE COUPLE DAYS PRIOR BECAUSE THAT'S THE OPTIMAL TIME FOR FERTILITY SO YES THERE IS DETED TO SUGGEST THAT IN TERMS OF LIKE COMPLETELY A LACK OF INTERESTS I DON'T BELIEVE THEIRE SATA BUT I'M NOT A NATSER IS THERE EVIDENCE TOT FEMALES WHO PERHAPS HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SO CLLE G SPOT ORGASMER CERVICAL ORGANASM CAN LEARN TO DO THAT AND I ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTING THAT WHENEVER THERE'S THA DISCUSSION ABOUT DIFFERENT FORMS OF FEMALE ORGANASM A PEOPLE ARE CAREFUL TO POINT OUT THAT MANY WOMEN DON'T HAVE PENETRATION BASED ORGANAISM AND THEN THEY SEPARATE OUT CLITERAL STIMULATION AS MORE A MORE COMMON ROUT TO ORGANASM BUT OF COURSE THERE CAN BE CLITERAL STIMULATION WITH PENETRATION ABSOLETELY RIGHT AND A DEPENDING ON THE PHYSICAL ARRANGEMENT A THERE CAN BE CLITERAL STIMULATION PURELY BY WAY OF PENETRATION THROUGH PELVIC CONTACT AM YOU KNOW FINGERS ET CETERA SO YES OR HO HOW DO WE HOW SHOAL WE THINK ABOUT THIS HOW SHALL WE TALK ABOUT IT SO THERE WAS AN INTERESTING STUDY THAT I JUST RAD RECENTLY WHERE THEY GAVE WOMEN WORDS FOR THESE THINGS RIGHT THO A THE THERE'S LIKE THE ROCKING STIMULATION SO THAT CAN ALSO STIMULATES THE MEATING THAT THE YOU'RE PENETRATING BUT THERES LIKE A ROCKING MOTION THAT CAN ALSO PENETRATE THE CLITTER IS THERE IS A STIMULATION OF JUST THE OUTER PART OF THE VIGINA WHICH AGAIN AS THEY ME CHION THE GSPOGHT IS THERE IT'S MORE HIGHLY INTERVATEDS O THAT CAN BE MORE STIMULATING THERE'S ALSO WAGS TO A LYING YOURSELF SO THAT WHEN YOU'R PENTRATING YOU'R PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE CLITERES AND THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW STIMULATION WITH LIKE ACTUAL STIMULATION OF THE CLIR LIKE INTENTIONAL STIMULATION EITHER BY YOURSELF OR BY THE PARTNER AND SO THERE ARE LUTIBLE DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT RIGHT A AND SO THERE I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALLY A KIND OF EXIT SO CAY TO EXPLORE AND NOT ALWAYS BE A HOME RUN AND I THINK THAT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GET INTO RELATIONSHIP WHERE YOUARE MAYBE SECOND THERD FOURTH TIME HAVING INTERCOURSE WITH SOME ONE THAT YOU CAN TRY AND EXPLORE TESE DIFFERENT THINGS OR IF THE PARTNER THEMSELVES KNOWS WHAT THEY LIKE TO ACTUALLY TELL THE OTHER PARTNER IT THERE'S A HUGE PART OF COMMUNICATION THAT I THINK IT IS PLAYS A HUGE ROLLEN IN THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW OURSELVES BETTER THA ANY ONE ELSE THA YOU CAN TELL YOUR PARTNER WHAT YOU LIKE AND I THINK TAT THAT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN TAUGHT HOW TO DO THAT YET A SUCH IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS FOR SO MANY REASONS AS YOU POINT OUT A DEFILY NOT SOMETHING THEY TEACH PEOPLE IN SCHOOL EXCEPT YOON THEY MIGHT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOU KNOW COMMUNICATION IS IMPORTANT AND THAT ALMOST ALWAYS CIRCLES BACK TO THE THE KEYFOR THINGS WE TALK ABOUT EARLIER WHICH IS YOU KOW CONSENT AND AGE APPROPRIATE A CONTACTS APPROPRIATE THESE KINDS OF THINGS AN A AND OBVIOUSLY SUBSTANCEIS LIKE ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS CAN STRONGLY CONFOUND TO THOSE ISSUES AND SO THAT'S WELL JUST LEAVE THAT AS AS A KIND OF AN OBVIOUS ONE A AS ALS WERE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNICATION ON SECUAL INTERACTIONS A PERHAPS IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO PEOPLE TO CULTIVATE A A LANGUAGE OR A NOMENCLATURE THERE TOO TO FACILITATE THAT A SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT I'VE HEARD THAT IS A QUITE USEFUL AS THINGS LIKE A YOUKNOW PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT AROUSAL TEMPLETS RIGHT SOME PEOPLE CERTANT IDEAS ORE STIMULATING TO THEM AND OTHER IDEAS ARE EVERSIVE TO THEM AND THEN THERE'S THIS CATEGORY AN BETWEEN WERE SOMETIMES PEOPLE SORT OF EITHER DON'T KNOW CAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TRIED IT OR HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT OR THEIRE SORT OF CURIOUS BUT KIND OF UNSURE OR IT MIGHT WORK IN THE RIGHT CONTACT BUT MAYBE NOT ALL THE TIME UM SO IS THERE ANY KIND OF STRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN PUT OUT THERE AS A WAY TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AROUND SEXUAL INTER ACTIONS YE I MEAN THERE'S NO LIKE SCRIPT BUT I THINK IN GENERAL YOU WANT TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION OUTSIDE OF THE BEDROOM SO NOT LIKE RIGHT BEFORE SEX A RIGHT AFTER SEX BECAUSE THAT LEADS TO LIKE AYOU KNOW A SENSE OF IN SECURITY FOR THE OTHER PERSON MI GI DO SOMETHING WRONG IND SOMETHING GO WRONG HERE SO YOU WANT A KIND OF MOVE THOSE TO A NEUTRAL LOCATION SO LIKE KITCHEN TABLE IN THE CAR WHATEVER SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU KNOW SEXES NOT CAND HAPPEN AM AT LEAST FOR THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT AND A M E YO LISTENING A SOME CHALLENGING CONVERSATIONS ON THIS POD GUST CHALLENGE IT A PREVIOUSLY CHALLEGING BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU TRY TO GET THINGS CLEAR AN IT AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE AN THIS ONE'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE THER'RE SO MANY COVIOTS EVERYTHING  RIGHT EE ON WOR YE WOL SEX IN CAR YOU IGHT GETEM OR THEY DID WHEN I WAS GROWING UP A AND SOMETIMES THEY STILL DO UM O CET PLEASE CONTINUE YES SO THAT'S ONE AND THEN TOO LIKE WHEN YOU'RE DISCUSSING IT I MEAN THIS IS KIND OF GOES FOR ANY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION IS LIKE YOU MAKE I STATEMENTS RIGT YOU THAT I LIKE IT WHEN THIS I DON'T LIKE IT WITH THIS IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU DID RIGHT TAT YOU DIDN'T DO THIS YOU DIDN'T DO THAT MAKES THE KIND OF AN ANIMOSITY SORT OF SITUATION AND THEN YOU KNOW I THINK ALSO PART OF IT IS LIKE BEING OPEN ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAN IT MADE IT'S NOT CHAN TO HAPPEN IN ONE CONVERSATION I THINK THAT'S THE HARD PART TECE YOU THINK YOUR GOING TO HAVE A CONVERSATIONS GAN TO GO GREAT AND THINGS ARE GING TO BE BETTER IT'S GON BE LIKE MULCIBLE CONVERSATIONS AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOT GING TO GO WELL RIGHT SO LIKE A THAT'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLYU GET THE HELP OF A SAX THERAPISTS AND THERE IS A WEBSIDE FOR THAT IT'S A S  C T A CECT DOT OR WHERE YOU CAN LOOK FOR A SAX THERAPIS NEAR YOU AND YOU CAN EVEN DO THOSE THINGS VIRTUALLY A AND SO THAT CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL WHEN YOU'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY HAVING A CONVERSATION YE I THINK UM AGAIN SUCH IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE A DIFFER IN TERMS OF THEIR LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE IT GETS AM BUT TE NTUALLY PROBLEMATIC BUT ALL SO IT CAN BE POTENTIALLY UM EDUCATIONAL UM AND THEN OF COURSE THERE THE TWISTS IN TURNS THAT OCCUR WITH WHEN ONE IS ASKING ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE'S AROUSAL TEMPLET OFTENTIMES YOU'LL LEARN THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE'S SEXUAL PAST AND THAT CAN BE EITHER NEUTRAL STIMULATING OR AVERSIVE RIGHT THAT CAN OPEN UP ALL SORTS OF OTHER ISSUES RELATES TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPLACE SO THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN PARS ALL OF THOSE NOW I JUST THINK IT'S WORTH HIGHLIGHTING UM THAT IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE CHALLENGING UM AND IT ALSO IS UNDERSTANDING WHY PONOGRAPHY ISN'T G INVALL THOSE CONVERSATIONS RIT RIGT IMOLY CONVERSATIONS THERE ARE BETWEEN A YOUR BRAIN YOUR HANDS IN YOUR EYES IN A REAR SUM A NOT CAN HILIDAY IN PARTICULAR ORDER OTHER UM I WANT A SWITCH GEAR SLIGHTLY U AN TALK ABOUT YUT IS I GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT YOURNARETRACT INFECTIONS LET'S MAKE IT BELADE TO BOTH FEMALES AND MALES BECAUSE YES MALES GET YOUR INARETRACT INFECTIONS FEMALES GET THEM MORE FEMALES ASKED ABOUT YOUR NRETRACT INFECTIONS HOW COMMON ARE THEY SHOULD THEY ALWAYS BE TREATED WITH ANTOBIOTICS IS CRAMBIARY REALLY A GOOD TREATMENT IF SO WIOR THEIR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BETTER IS IT BELAT TO TH YACIDITY OR ALCALINITY UM HOW DOES ONE PREVENT GETTING OUTIES CAN GET THEM FROM SWIMMING SHOULD YOU YEURNATE AFTER SEX TELLUS ABOUT YOUTIIS AND HOW NOT TO GET THEM AND HOW TO GET RID OF HAPPY TFELL OUTIIZE ARE VERY COMMON IN WOMEN A OBLY UP TO FIFTY PER CENT IF WOMEN GET AT LEAST ONE OUTIA IN THEIR LIFETIME AND UP TO A THIRD OF THEM GET RECURRENT OUTIIES AND WHAT THAT MEANS AS THEY HAVE TWO OR MORE IN SIX MONTHS OR THREE OR MORE IN A YEAR NOW THIS I COMMON AND SO WE'LL SEE A LOT OF VIT AND IT'S NOT AS A UNTIL YOUR HAVING RECURRENT YOU TET THE ATURES HAVE ONE YEAR OR YOU HAVE ONE EVERY FEW YEARS IT'S NOT A HUGE ISSUE IN MEN HOWEVER OUTIZE ARE MUCH LEST COMMON AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE EARETHREAT ENS LONGER SO THERE'S LAST A ENTRY FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD INTO THE BLATTER WHICH CAUSES INFECTIONS AND SO A THE WHEN MEN GOULD A UTIIDES CONCERNING LIKE ISE A MAN GETTING THE UT  EUT OTHER'S MULTIPLE REASONS THAT IT COULD HAPPEN BUT IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THERE'S NO ANATOMIC ABNORMALITY AR FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITY WITH THA BLATTER THAT'S CAUSING THE UTES IN TERMS OF PREVENTION A THERE ARE KIND OF MAJOR THINGS ARE HADED IN THE GUYLINES THAT WE ALL WE ALL TALK ABOUT SO ONE IS HY DRATION SO MAKING SURE YOUR DRINKING ABOUT TRUTO THREE LEADERS OF FLUID IDEALLY WATER A DAY A DILUTION IS THE SOLUTION TO THE POLLUTION WRIGT SO DRINKING MORE FLUIDS IS GOING TO GET THAT BACTERIA AND YOUIN A P IT OUT CAN HELP KEEP NOT LET IS SIT AROUND THE BLATTER VERY OFTEN ANOTHER THING IN WOMEN WHO HAVE ALTERED STATES OF ESTROGEN WHETHER ITS POSTMENAPOZZLE SURGICAL A MENAPAUSE OR MAY BE HAVE A RODUCED ESTEROGEN FOR POSTPARTOM OR ATHER REASONS OR THAT ABOUT TURN THE SICON HALF OF THE MONSTREL SICLE WERE NOT NECESSARILY FOR THOSE SPECIFIC PEOPLE BUT FOR THOSE SPECIFIC TIMES BUT CAUSE ITS PRETTY SHORT LIVDED A IGUESS YOU COULD USE IT BUT A IS IS VAGINAL ESTROGEN SO VAGINAL ESTROGEN MEANING ESTRON TA SUPPLIED IN THE VAGINA EITHER THROUGH A CREAM A SUPPOSITORY OR A RING IS IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE OCCURRENCE OF RECURRENT UT ES AND THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE LOW ESTROGEN THE PIATION THE VIGINA GOES UP AND THE PIATION OF GANA GOES UP BECAUSE THERE'S LESS CONVERSION OF GLAKAGEN TO LACDO BACILI AND THEN THOSE LACDOBASILLA ARE PROVENTETIVE FOR UTES SO ESSENTIALLY YOU WANT A REDUCED THE PE BACK TO ITS NORMAL ACITIC P H AND VAGNAL ESTRN IS VERY EFFECTIVE AT DOING THAT IN FACT AND OUR CLINICS WILL ACTUALLY CHECK OF VAGINAL P G YOU KNOW TO SEE IF THERE IS AN INDICATION THAT THEIR PAGE IS TOO HIGH THAT MAY BE THEY DO NEED VAGEAL ASTRON PARTICTLER ON THE PERRY MENAPOS CAS HARD TO TELL JUST BY LOOKING IF THEY ARE REALLY A HEADING INTO LOWER ESTROGENS STATE SOMETIMES AND SO THAT'S VERY VERIEFFECTIVE AND VERY VERY SAFE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ESTROGEN YOU KNOW THE THE WOMEN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE WAY BACK WHEN SORT OF MADE A BIG STINK ABOUT HOW ESTRGENS LAID TO CANCER HOWEVER A VAGINAL ESTRGEN HAS NEVER EVER BEEN A REPORTED BREAST CANCOR UDERAN CANCER OR ANY OTHER BLOOD CLOT ANY OTHER ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIE WITH VAGINAL ESTERGEN YOU CAN GET SOME BREAST TENDERNESS SOME DISCHARGE THOSE THINGS CAN OCCUR A BUT THE ABSORBED AMOUNT VASINALLY IS SO LITTLE THAT YOUR ESTROGEN LEVEL BARELY GOES UP IT DOESN'T EVEN REACH PREMEN APUZZLE LEVEL SO JUST GOES UP VERY SLIGHTLY IN THE BLOODSTREAM NOT ENOUGH TO CRATE ANY SORT OF ABNORMALITY SO VAGINAL ESTERN IS EXTREMELY SAFE AND IT'S PRETTY AFFORDABLE YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE COOPONS IF YOUR INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER IT THROUGH YOU KNOW A GOODARAX OR MARCUBAN'S FARMASY AND GET IT VERY VERY AFFORDABLY AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE IT DOES TAKE ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO WORK SO YOU NED HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT YOU PLIED ABOUT TWICE A WEEK AT NIGHT SOMETIMES THREE TIMES A WEEK A AND IT'S ITS VERY EFFECTIVE THE RING YOU PUT IN ONCE N AT LAST FOR THREE MONTHS BUT SO GENTLY SPEAKING THAT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE OPTION FOR LOW ESTROGEN STATES OTHER KIND OFS SIMPLE THINGS ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE YOUR COMPLETELY EMPTYING YOUR BLTDER SO OVER A LIFETIME PEOPLE CAN DEVELOP SOME MILD PELVIC FLORDIS FUNCTIONRY NOT ENOUGH  TO CREATE PAIN OR DISCOMFORT BUT MAYBE THEYRE NOT EMPTYING COMPLETELY RIGHT BECAUSE MAYBE THEY USED TO HOLD THEIR EARN FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHEN THEY WERE CID OR MAY BE THERE ALWAYS HOVERING OVER THE TWELICS THAT ON A SIT ON IT AT WORK AND OVER TIME THAT CAN CRATE A LITTLE BIT OF MILD THIS FUNCTION WHICH CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPLETELY EMPTY THE BLADER AND WHEN YEURN IS SITTING IN THE LATTER FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IT'S BASICALLY FOOD FOR BACTERIA TO GROW AND SO BACK TERE GROWS AND THEN YOU GET CURRENT YOU TI SO MAKING SURE YOU'VE COMPLETE EMPTY BYC SITTING RELAXING ON THE TOILET SOMETIMES LEADING FORWARD AND THEY MAYBE GOING A SECOND TIME SO STANDING UP SITTING BACK DOWN GOING AGAIN AND EVEN FOR MEN SOMETIMES TRYING TO SIT AND SEE IF YOU COMPLETELY EMPTY CAUSE SOMETIMES STANDING YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO EMPTY COMPLETELY WELL THE LOT OF MENARGAN THE UST THR LESE YOU IT WAS FUN TO RESEARCH FOR THE SUPPESODE BECAUSE M THERARE ENTIRE DISCUSSIONS ON REDIT ABOUT WI WHAT PERCENTAGE OF MAL SIT WHILE YOURE NATING OF MINOR SHENNING BASE ON HAVING VISITED MANY MAL BATHROOMS IN MY LIFETIME IN  JUST BENG IN THE WORLD A THA THAT I ASSUMED THAT MEN STOOD UP IN ORDER TO TO URNATE BUT THEREARE A DECENT PERCENTAGE MEN TO DOWN YOR THERE ARE AN IN FACT S VERYLE LIKE COUNTRY AND PROBALY THE REASON ITS BECOME MORE INTERESTING LATELY MY MEDIATRY SO A CERTAIN COUNTRY WAS RECENTLY SURVEYED THING WAS GERMANY ABUT ESSENTIALLY TIS RECENTLY PICKED UP BY THE MEDIA THAT GERMANS SIT MORE OFTEN TO P AND SO YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE LIKE ALWAYS AS BETTER FOR ME TO SIT TO POUR STANDAP AND THERE'S A WHOLE BIG DISCUSSION ON THE MEDIA BUT THE REASON BEING IS WHEN YOUR SITTING YOUR PUBLIC FLOOR IS MOST RELAXED AND SO IF YOUR HAVING ANY ISSUES EMPTYING YOUR BLODY YOU'RE GOING A P BETTER ALSO IF YOU HAVE AN ENLARGE PROSAY WHICH I 'M SURE ING A TALK ABOUT PRO PROSTA ENLARGEMENT THAT CAN SOMETIMES ALLOW YOU TO DEVELP A LITTLE BUT MORE IN TRABDOMINAL PRESSURE CAUSE YOUR SITTING AND YOU CAN LEAN FORWARD TO OVERCOME SORT OF A BLOCKAGE AND AND SO THERE ARE SOME S SOME INDICATIONS WERE SITTING IS BETTER BUT IF YOU'R BEING FINE IN YOUR STANDING THAT'S FINE TO I DON LY YOU HAVE TO I THING IS JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOWING OTHER COUNTRIES THEY DO MORE AND HERE WE DON'T AND TOT DONT THING IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCE KIN A SPERMICIDES OR CONDUMS OR BOTH ON INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF YOU TAES FOR A FEMALES SO SPERMICIDES ABSOLUTELY SO SPERMICIDE IF YOUR CONDUM HAS FIRMICIN OR YOUR USING SPIRMICIDES THAT IS A KNOWN RISK FACTOR FOR YOU TIYES OTHER THINGS I WANT O TOUCH ON YOU DID ASK ABOUT CRANBERRY SO CRANBERY'S ACTUALLY IN THE AMERICAN YOUR LOGICAL ASSOCIATION GUIDE LINES FOR PREVENTION OF R CURRENT YOU TIIES AND WOMEN NOW HOW DOES CRANBERRY WORK RIGHT LIKE DO I TO STRING CHOSE IT'S ACTUALLY A SPECIFIC ACTIVE INGREEDENT IN THE CRAN BERRY WHICH IS CALLED PRO ANTHOS SIANADENS OR P  CS AND IU KOWHT THEY'VE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE AMOUNT OF P  CS YOU NEED IN WHAT FORMULATIONS WO YOUD THIRTY SIX MELEGRAMS OF P  CS IN A SOLUBLE FORM SO LOT OF THE SUPPLEMENTS ON THE MARKET WILL SAY THAT THEYRE THIRTY SIX MELEGRAMS OF P  CS BUT THEIRE LIKE THE WHOLE BERRY SO THE USING THE THE SKIN OF THE BERRY AND THE STEM OF THE BERRY AND THAT'S NOT GAT A HELP YOU SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPPLEMENT USING IS A SOLUBLE FORM OF THE CRAN BARE IN IT'SACTUALLY VERY VERY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE RISK OF YOU TIYE SHOULD YOU MEAN AM CAPSALS LIKE A JOKE AP A YET IT'S A CAPSUL AN THAT YOU TAKE ONCE A DAY AND THERE IS SOME ALTHOUGH NOT AS MUCH DATA THAT IF YOU'RE HAVING THEM AROUND SECS WHICH SOME WOMEN DO ALWAYS HAVE POST COIDALE YOU TIZES A THAT YOU CAN TAKE TWO ON THE DAY OF SEX AND TWO ON THE DAY AFTER AND THAT MAY BE HELPFUL BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DATA THERE BUT CERTAINLY ANOPTION THAT YOU CAN TRY THAT'S PRETTY LOW RISK A SO THAT'S KIND OF THE THE GUIDE LINES NOW THERE'S A TUN OF OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP PREVENT THAT ARE KIND OFS AVAILABLE AND HAVE SOME DATA BEHIND THEM SO D MANOS IS ONE OF THEM WE TAKE A YOU KNOW ABOUT TWO GRAMS OF DAY OF D MANOS AND YOU DRINK IT IN THAT ACTULLY HELPS  REDUCE YOU T IRIS IT'S E SUDYING THE SMALLE RANDOMIS CONTROLLED TRIAL TO BE EFFECTIVE AND A AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE BIGGER ONES THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE USE LIKE PROBIOTICS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF HETEROGENATY AS YOU KNOW IN PROBIOTICS AND WHAT TO TAKE AND ARE THEY REALLY EFFECTIVE VAGINALLY A IN THE FLORA THERE SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE BIG THINGS AND THERE IS A LACTURALL LOT OF MICROBIUM STUDY AND YOU T IZE GOING ON ACT AT YOU SEE A LA A WE'RE THE LOOKING AT THE MICROBIUM OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE AT RISK FOR OU T IES OR EVEN OVER AC TO LATER OTHER CONDITIONS LIKE THAT IN THER TRY TO FIGURE OUT LIKE IS THERE SOMETHING HERE THAT WE CAN TARGET OR THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT IS IS CAUSING PROBES BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT WITES HAPPENING A IN TERMS OF WIPING FROM FRONT TO BACK AND SWIMMING AND KEING AFTER SACKS THERE'S NO GOOD DATA AND ANY OF THOSE THINGS A WIPING FROM FRONT TO BACK I THINK IT DOES CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE SHAME LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL IF YOU WIPE BACK TO FRUN AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT LIKE YOU KNOW AS LONG AS YOU'VE LIKE CLEANED YOURSELF SO TO SPEAKS I THINK A IT'S LAST OF AN ISSUE WOLERTURNU IS O YOU REFERRING TO ANY CONTAMINATION FROM AN AR ANY BACTORIA ROUND THE A YEAND A LOT OF WOMEN WHO HAVE ORCURRENT OUTIES LIKE TEND TO COME AND FEEL VERY DIRTY THIKE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM LIKE GO I WASH ALL THE TIME I'M REALLY CLEAN A REALLY THIS AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY'RE DOING IT'S PROBABLY A MICRO BIUM OF FACT OR A HORMONAL OF FACT OR YORE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THAT WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER IT COULD ALSO BEING ANATOMICAL OR FUNCTIONAL PROBLEM WERE YOU'RE OT EMPTYING THE LATTER CORRECTLY SO TH AS LOTS OF DIFFERENT FACTORS IT COULD BEN IT'S  LIKE VERY INFREQUENT I WOULD THAY LIKE I'VE NEVER SEEN A PATIENT WHOSE DIRTY AND NOT THE REASON O CAN OUTIES A PERHAPS EVEN THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE THER CLEANING TOO MUCH BASED ON WHAT YOU TOLD US ARALY YE AND THE'RE ELIMINAING THE GOT MICRO ESCUSE ME JUST ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE HOM AGAIN NO PONE INTENDED AM PERHAPS IT'S THER THEY ARE ABOLISHING THE LOCA MICROBYUM ON THE SKIN TOO MUCH CLEANING LIMINATES THE MICROBUM ON THE SKIN NT THAT WE DON'T WANT A WASH WE AM WHEN SONINBURG WAS A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST HE SAID ASHE KIDS CAN DEVELOP A VERY HEALTHY MICROBYUM AN GENERAL MICROBYUM OFTENTIMES BY SORRY PARENTS NOT WASHING THEIR HANDS BEFORE EATING IF THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH SOIL OUTSIDE OR DIR A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AS ACTUALLY HEALTHY PETS ACTUALLY OFFER MICROBYUM SUPPORT THIS IS SO WEIRD I KNOW IT SOUNDS  NI READYBUT WE AVE TO IMAGINE HOW WE HAVE ALL DOES A SPECIES WAS NOT WITH ANTIBACTORIAL SO SAND UM ALCOHOL SWABS EVERYWHERE AND A NOVYSY WE DON'T WANT INFECTIONS UT OVERCLEANING CAN DESTRUPT THE MICROBYUM WHICH PRESUMABLY CAN LEAD TO OUTIS SO PERHAPS SOME ONE WHO'S CLEANING EXCESSIVELY IS MORE AT RISK THAN SOMEBODY IS CLEANING A LITTLE LASS ABSOLUTELY AND ACTUALLY THE CLEANING CAN IRRITATE THE DERMISRIHTS AT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GATE CONTACT OR ETISE TYPED SYMPTOMS FROM OVER CLEANING AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE YOU NO THINGS FOR THAT I I DEAFLY HAVE A UTIDE DEFLY HAVE ONE WILL KNOW YOU DON'T BUT THERE'S A HOST OF OTHER THINGS THAT IT COULD BE ONE OF THEM COULD BE THAT ANOTHER VERY COMMON ONE THAT WE ALREADY TOUCH ON IS PAVIC FLOORIDAS FUNCTION SO VERY OFTEN PALVIC FLORDISFUNTION JUST TLIKE YOU HAD PAIN WITH ARNATION WOMEN CAN ALSO DEVELOP PAIN WITH ARNATION THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY AND IT CAN START WHERE THEY HATO YOU T I THAT TRIGGER THE PALVIC FLOOR AND THEN THE PALIC FLORDIS DIDN'T RELAX THAT THE PAIN DISTRIGGER THE PALIC FOR TE TENTS UP AND DIDN'T RELAX BECAUSE AGAIN WERE NOT TAUGHT HOW TO RELAX OUR PALVIC FLOOR AND A AND THEN THEY'VE DEVELOPE PAVIC FLORDIS FUNCTIO LIKE WISE UTYI NOTE GOING AWAREWISE THAT KEEP COMING BACK AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER COMMON THING THAT WE SEE  IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE QUARTANT QUOT RECURENT UTIIES BUT DON'T REALLY HAVE THEM TO BE CLEAR I EXPERIENCE THE PAIN IN URINATION AS A CONSEQUENCE OF TRYING THOSE DAM KEY WILES FIHE EVERYONE  COING BUT STOPPING THAT UM WAS IN FORMATIVE IN TWO DIRECTIONS ONE IT RELIEVE THE PAIN VERY QUICKLY SO THELSE GOOD THE OTHER WAS A I REALIZE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A PALVIC FLOOR THAT'S NEITHER A HYPER CONTRACTED OR OVER RELAXED IN SOME CASES JUST NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR IT IS TT IS THE BEST CIRCUMSTANC RIGHT SO UM AND THER ONLY REASON I MENTION THAT IS BECAUSE AM OBVIOUSLY THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT ABOUT MY PALVIC FLOOR THIS DISCUSSION IS ABOUT FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE PERHAPS NEED TO CLEAN LASS SOME PEOPLE MAYBE MORE BUT PROBABLY NOT BASE ON WHAT YOU SAID SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NEE TO STRENGTHEN THEIR PUIC FLOOR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NEED TO AM RELAX THEIR PUBLIC FLOOR AN SOME PEOPLE'S PUIC FLOOR IS PROBABLY A O K I ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT U ANYTHING MEDICAL OR YOU ESPECIALLY HORMON STUFF THIS HAPENS ALON THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND UM THAT GET INTO IT SEEMS WITH WITH MALE SO LIKE EVERY MALE NOW SEEMS TO WONDER IF THEIR TESTASTRONE IS TOO LOW NOT THE ONES THAT ARE BLASTING TUSTOSTRONE CAUSE THEY KNOW SUCCESSIVELY HIG U AND AS YOU POINT OUT EARLIER AT LEAST INTROM DISEXUAL FUNCTION THAT'S UNLIKELY TO BE THE CASE MAY I LESS O DESIRE BUT ON BUTTIN TERMS OF A GENITAL BASE AROUSAL FUNCTION YAND I MEAN YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TOSACTERAL LOT ON THE POD CASTS SO I'M SURE YOUR AUDIENCE KNOWS VERY WELL THE MULTITUDE OF BENEFITS FOR TESTASTRO SO I THINK THERE IS VALUE IN ASSESSING HARMONS PANELS AND ASASSING YOUR LEVEL OF FREE TESASTRON TESTASTRONE AND YOU KNOW ASSESSING IF YOUR HAVING SINTERS ARE NOT ALWAYS SEXUAL RIGHT IT CAN BE DEPRESSION IT CAN BE WEIGHTGAIN THAT YOU'RE NOT GAINING A MUSCLE MASS A YOU CAN HAVE COGNITIVE CHANGES SO THOSE THINGS CAN STILL BE A SIGN OF LO TOSTATERNA AND VERY VALUABLE AND IMPORTANT TO ASSESS THAT REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER THING THAT WE GET BACK TO A OUTIASO WHA TOK ABOT KINNEYSTONES BUT AM I'VE HEARD OF WOMEN USING A SMALL AMOUNT OF TESTASTRON CREAM DIRECTLY ON THE CLITERUS AS A WAY TO AMPLIFY THE MAYBE IT'S THE A DESIRE ANDAROUSAL EFFECT OR PERHAPS JUST ONE OR THE OTHER SO I'VE ATHE WAY THAT WE DISCUSSE TESTACERONUWS IN THERE ARE LIKE CONSENSEOF STATEMENTS AND THERE'S A ACTION ABUNDANCE OF DATA ON TOSTATRONE USE PARTICULARY POSTMEN APOZZLE WOMEN FOR LOW LIBIDA OR LOW SEXUAL DESIRE AND IT'S ALL BEEN VERY POSITIVE INCICERES BEEN INCREASED A SEXUAL DESIRE BASE ON VALUE QUESTIONARS INCREASED NUMBER OF SEXUALLY SATISFYING EVENTS WI'TH TESTASTRON USE NOW THE RANGE OF TESTACERNAN WOMEN IS ABOUT A TENTH OF THE THE AMOUNT OF TOSATERNA MAN NEEDS RIGHT SO TESTASTRO AN CREAM IS SYSTEMICALLY ABSORBED WHEREVER YOU APPLY IT AND SO THE WAY WE GENERALLY RECOMMEND WOMEN TO TRED US IF THEY ARE HAVING LOW LIBEDA WHEN WE'VE RULED OUT OTHER ISSUES THAT MAY BE PSYCHOLOGIC BYIN AF RELATIONSHIP OTHER ISSUES THAT CAN A FECLABETO MEDICATIONS HERE'S A LOT OF THINGS OBVIOUSLY THAT GO INTO THAT BUT IF WE SET AND WE'VE CHECKED THEIR TESACERNAT APPEARS TO BE LOW FOR PHYSIOLOGIC LEVELS FOR WOMEN WHICHING AN AS ONE TENTH OF THE MALE LEVEL THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY PRESCRIBE AWFULLABL TESTASTRONE AND THE GUIDE LINES OR THE CONSENSE OF STATEMENTS ARE NOT A TRUE GUIDELANES BUT THEY RECOMMEND USING TRANSDURMAL TESTASTRO AND SO GETTING YOU KNOW ANDREW GELL TUBES FROM THE FARMESEY AND PUTTING A TENTH OF ONE TUBE ON THE BACK OF THE CALVE OR THE UPPER OUTER BUDDOC HAIRILESS AREA A FOR ABSORPTION THAT CAN IMPROVE DESIRE OVER ALL AND THEN THE OTHER PLACE WE USE TESTASTRODEAS IN WOMEN WHO HAVE OF WHAT WE CALL VESTIBULODINIA TO THE VESTIBULE IS THE AREA OUTSIDE THE VIGINA WHICH IS VERY HARMONALLY ACTIVE THERE'S LOTS OF ANERGEN RECEPTORS THERE AND IT CAN ACTUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE HORMONAL ISSUES MEANING LOWER TESTASTRODE AND ASTER IN THAT AREA IT CAN CAUSE PAIN AND SO ACTUALLY APPLYING A COMBINED OR COMPOUNET ESTERGEN TESTASTRON CREAM TO THAT AREA OVER TIME CAN REDUCE THAT PAIN AND DISCOMFORT SO AS YOU KNOW TO SASSON RECEPTORS OR ANDERS AN RECEPTORS ALL OVER THE BODY VERY MUCH IN THE GENERALS VERY MUCH IN THE BRAIN AND THEIR VERY USEFUL TO A VERY USEFUL PLACE TO TREAT WOMEN FOR THOSE ISSUES THANK YOU GIDNEYSTON'T HOP DO NEVER HAVE ONE I OT YE DON'T EITER PEOPLE GET THEM A HOW DO YOUAVE WELD GETTING THEM IN HOW DOYU GET RID OF SO KIDNEYSTONES A VERY OFTEN OR THEY A THEY CAN BEFER A VRITIN TOPROMETABOLIC DISORDERS RIGHT SO IT CAN BE ONE DEHYDRATION IS OF VERY COMMON CAUSE OF IT SO A DEHYDRATION COMBINED WITH MAY BE A SLIGHT METABOLIC ADNORMALITY WHERE YOUR CREATING MORE CACIUM OR OXILATE IN YOUR EARINE CAN RESULT IN A IN KIDNEYSTONES AND SO HOW CAN YOU PREVENT THEM I AN I EACH PERSON IS INDIVIDUAL IF YOU GET AKIDNEY STONE TYPICALLY WE DO WITH CALL THE TWENTY FOR HOUR EARN ANALYSIS PLUS SOME BLOOD WORK TO ASSESS WHAT IS THE METABOLIC ADNORMALITY SO WE CAN TARGET THAT EITHER WITH DIET OR WITH MEDICATION AND SO THE CUN OF GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIDNEY STONES ONE IS INCREASES YOUR FLUID AN TAKE TO TWO TOR THREE LEARS AGAIN THE SAME NUMBER I TOLD YOU BEFORE YOU WANT A DECREASE YOUR OXILATE INTAKE NEFHUGUGLE OX LAG AND FIND MILLIONTHINGS THAT YOU EAT THAT HAVE OXILATE IN THEM BUT THE BIG ONES ARE SPINAGE AND RUBAR A WRE SEEING A LOT OF NUTS TOO THAT ARE EATIN PEOPLE EATING LOT MORE NUTS TO GET MORE PROTINE SO U NO CUTTING BACK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF ALL OF THAT IN YOUR DIABUT HAVING LIKE A SPINNER SALAD EVERY DAY WHILE SWICH IT  A DIFFERENT GREEN WRIGHT DON'T EATS FINAGE EVERYDAY A ALSO YOU WANT IT INCREASE YOUR CITTRATE AND TIK THATS AN INHIBITER OF KIDNEYSTONE FORMATION SO INCREASING FRUITS AND A AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO INCREASE CITRATE VEGETABLES AS WELL ACTUALLY ANE EASILY ACCESSIBLE THING IS CRYSTAL LIGHT IT HAS A HIGH A CITRATE COMPOSITIONS THA YOU CAN DRINK CRYSTAL LIGHT WITH THAT TO  THREE LEADERS AND THAT CAN BE HELPFUL A YOU WANT A DECREASE YOUR PROTINE INTAKE SO HIGH LEVELS OF A A PURINS ORE PURGENIC MEATS LIKE RED MEATS AND THINGS CAN ALSO PUT YOU AT HIGHER RISK SO THESE ARE KUN OF THE GENERAL SORT OF PROVENTATIVE MEASURES WE TALK ABOUT FOR KIDNEYSTONES A IF YOU HAVE A KIDNEYSTONE SO A LOT OF TIPPEOPLE CAN HAVE KIDNEYSTONES AND THEIR KIDNEYS THEY'RE NOT CREATING ANY PROMS THEI'R TINY WE CAN OBSERVE THEM OVER TIME IF THEY START COMING IF THEY STR GOING VERY LARGE OR THEY ARE STARTING TO MOVE INTO THE URITERS OF THE TUBES THAT TRAIN THE KIDNEY OFTEN TIMES THEY'RE THEIR COMPANIED WITH PAIN QUITE A BIT OF PAIN A AND IT CAN BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THOSE CASES A WE CAN IF THEY'RE NOT HAVING ANY INFECTION SYMPTOMS THING THERE'S NO SIGNS OF A URINARY TRACT IN FACTIOND O THERE'S NO FEVERS NO CHILLS WE CAN TREAT IT CONSERVATIVELY WITH PAIN MEDICATION AND ALSO UNDER OUR MEDICATIONS LIKE FLAL MAXERS YOU USE FOR A ENLARGE PROCED AS WELL THAT ACT YOU RELAXES THE OU READERALL SMOOTH MUSCLE TO ALLOW THE STONE TO PASSALE BUT BETTER A IF YOU'RE HAVING AN INFACTION YOU GOT GO TREATED RIGHT AWAY YOU CAN GET VERY SICK VERY QUICKLY IN FACT A I'VE SEEN YOUNG HEALTHY PATIENTS LIKE THEY'RE PEALTIER THAN ME WALK IN TH IN THE YAR WITH A KIDNEYSTONE AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE IN THE ICY BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY SICK BECAUSE OF A KIDNEYSTONE BUT OF SMUMBERED YOUR AN IDEA AE A TEA COLORED YOURANCS OP THE MEANING BLOOD IN THE URAN YET ALL OF THOSE ARE IMPORTANT WARNING SINSE THAT YOU IDEALLY DON'T GET TO YET BLOOD IN THE EARN I MEAN DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN INFECTION AT COULD JUS BE IRRITATHION FROM THE STONE BUT CERTAINLY FEVEROUS CHILLS OR YOU HAVE A SIGN OF IT INFECTION AND THE STONE LOOKS LIKE ITS BLOCKING SO IF YOU GET IMAGING AN OU SEE WAS CALLED HYDRON OR THROSIS OR PRESSURE BEHIND THE KIDNEY AND YOURE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THESE SIGNS OF INFECTION WE DON'T WANT A WAIT BECAUSE YOU CAN GET SICK PRETTY QUICKLAY U AND THEN YOU KNOW ONCE A TO TREAT THE KIDTY SONSERS THREE MAJOR OPTIONS ONE IS SHOCKWAVES ANOTHER IS YOU READER OSCOPY WHERE WE GO IN WITH A CAMERAN WE HAVE SMALL LEAVS OR WE BA BREAK IT UP INTO SMALL PIECES AND DEARS O THE CAMERA INSERTED THROUGH THE U REATH CORRECT YOUR SLEEP UNDER ANESTESE US SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO ATHER GET I SAW THE WINDS AND THEN A PERCUTAN AS NAFERALESS OTOMY WHICH IS DONE IF YOU HAVE A LARGE KIDNEY STONE OR A VERY HARD KIDNEY STONE THAT'S UP IN THE KIDNEY YOU CAN GO IN THROUGH THE BACK WITH A SMALL LIKE A SMALL INCISION AND WITH A SPECIALIZED CAMERA THAT GOES IN AND USS ULTRASON AC LESS O TRIP TE TO BREAK UP THAT STONE AND KIND OF SUCK IT OUT THAT WAY S O'RE EXTREMELY HELPFUL UM BITS OF INFORMATION NOT EVEN BITS THES SIR A THIS IS ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF USEFUL INFORMATION I LIKE TO PIV IT AGAIN UM FOR SAKE OF BREAD  WE CAN'T GO INTO EXTREME DEPTHS ON EVERYTHING WAT UM APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS T TO FOLLOW THIS CARASEL WITH ME UM ORAL CONTRACEPTION PREVIOUSLY ON THIS PAT CAST I HOSTEDA A FEMALE PHYSICIAN GESSD UM WHO OFFERED BOTH SIDES OF FEMALE ORAL CONTRACEPTION DISCUSS SOME OF THE BENEFITS DISCUSS SOME OF THE RISKS I MADE THE DECISION TO POST CLIPSE ABOUT BOTH ON THE INTRINETTE AN WOW WOW WOW WAS I SURPRISED BUT ALSO FRANKLY A BIT SHOCKED AND THEN FINALLY UM INTRIGUED WHY HOW POLERIZE THE DISCUSSION IS AROUND FEMALE ORAL CONTRACEPTION AM END FEMALE CONTRACEPTION IN GENERAL SO NEWVERING A NOR PLANT AM THE PILL BROUD CATEGORY OF THINGS THERE BUT FOR SAKE AF DISCUSSION THE PILL ET CETERA IT SEEMED THAT APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF RESPONSES WHICH SEEM TO COME MAINLY FROM WOMEN WERE OF THE THIS STUFF IS TERRIBLE IT RUINED MY LIFE IT RUINS LIVES IT UM DESTROYS YOU IT HAS IMMENSE AM RISK AND THEN THE OTHER HALF UM SEEMED TO SAY KNOW THERE'S REDUCE RISK OF CERTAIN FORMS OF CERVICAL CANCER AUM THIS HAS ALLOWED ME A THE OBSECUAL CHOICES IN LIFE STYLE THAT I PREFER WITHOUT RISK OF PREGNANCY I MEAN IT WAS ASTONISHING TO THE POINT WHERE I THOUGHT WOL IF ONLY I COULD POSTPOSTCLIP SIMULTANEOUSLY SO AM OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS A BUT I DO KNOW THAT THIS IS AMONG THE MORE POLARIZING TOPICS AVAILABLE FOR DISCUSSION UAM SO WHAT IS THE STORY MEANING WHAT OR THE DATA ABOUT ORAL CONTRACEPTION WHY SO MUCH CONTROVERSY AND WHANTS THE REAL DEAL HERE YES SO IT IS A VERY POLERIZING TOPIC AND THERE IS ABUNDANT DATA ABUNDIDATED THAT WE EVEINTOTO STUDY AND AGAIN THIS IS A NOT LIKE HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE BUT WE LOOKED AT REDIT THREADS AND WE LOOKED AT SEXUAL DISFUNCTIONS TO THT THE LOW LABITO DE ORGAS LIKE DIFFICULTIES AND WE LIKE RED HUNDREDS OF THREADS AND WE DID LIKE A QUALITIVE ANALS INFETI IN FEMALE TO FEE LIKE WHAT ORE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT AND PROBLEMS WITH ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES AND ANT HE DEPRESSANCS LEADING TO LOW LABITO AND AND BEING VERY LIKE AS YOU DESCRIBED VERY LIKE THIS RUINED MY LIFE WAS VERY COMMENT AND SO THAT THE THEORY IS THAT YOU KNOW TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES INCREASE IVES THE AMOUNT OF SEC HARM ONE BINDING GLOMULAN WHICH BINDS TESTASTRONE AND ASTROGEN AND THAT ACTUALLY MAKES TESTASTERA UNLESS AVAILABLE WHICH IS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT HARMONE FOR DESIRE AND SO IN SOME SUBSET OF PEOPLE THEI'R SEEING THERY SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES NOW I THINK THAT THERE IS YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHICH WOMEN ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S PROBABLY A VERY SMALL SUBSET OF PEOPLE BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THIS DOES HAPPEN AND THAT WHEN YOU MEASURE AS TE SBEGY LEVELS THERE UP AND THAT EVEN AFTER THEY STOPPED OR ALL CONTRACEPTIVES YOU'LL SEE ELEVATED AS E SBEGY LEVELS FROM BASE LINE RAL YOU KNOW FOR LIKE AT LEAST FOUR MONTHS AFTERWARDS YOU'LL STILL SEE ELEVATE ESAEBEGY LEVEL SO WE DON'T KNOW BUT NOT INFINITE WE DON'T KNOW AND AND YENENDECANC AGANS WEIRD BECAUSE IT IT UM WE ASSUME EVERYTHING IS A SHORT TERM OF FECT BUT THERE'S SOME PLASTOSY IN THE SYSTEM SO BECAUSE IT'S A NARROW INDICRENTAEM SO YET SO I THIN GATHER SOME NARROW PLASTOSITY THERE THAT OCCURS AS WELL AND SO WE DO SEE THIS AND I THINK THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS YE APSLY ORAL CONTSEMTS ARE AMAZING RIGHT THERE THEIR HELPFUL FOR SEXUAL FREEDOMS FOR FOR PREVENTING PREGNANCY FOR YEU KNOW FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND PARTICULARLY OTHER CONDITIONS TOO LIKE PICIOESS AND AND OTHER PROBLEMS OR ALL CONTRACEPTIVES ARE AMAZING AND THEY'VE CHANGED YOU KNOW GINACOLOGY IN MANAGIMENT OF THESE WOMEN FOR YOU KNOW AND IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW YES I DO THINK THAT THERE IS OROL CONTRACEPTIVE RELATED SEXUAL DISFUNCTION USUALLY LODOS ESTROGEN A SORT OF CONTRACEPTIVES ARE THE CULPRIT ABUT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S AGAIN THE DATA FEMAL SECTUASMEC LEISURE IS JUST NOT AS REBUST AS MAL SEXUAL DISFUNCTION LITERATURE I SAW A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT HOWT ORL CONTRACEPTION HEAD LET TO DEPRESSIVE LIKE SYMPTEMS U OR JUST CON ADONIAN U APETHY NOT JUS LOW LOWERD LABITO I CAN IMAGINE HOW THAT WOULD BE THE CASE THROUGH THE ELEVATE SECS HOMOR N BIDING GLOBULAN WHICH IS YOU UM PREVENTING TO SAUCER AN ESTERGEN FROM UM ING FREE I LITERALLY I AND EXERTING THEIR EFFECTS ON NOTJUST THE BODY BUT THE BRAIN BUT IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT ORL CONTRACEPTION CAN DESTRUPT NO TRANSMITTERS I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY I DON'T THINK SO NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE A WELL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE ORL CONTRACEPTION FOR WOMEN SUS WHERE WE NORMALLY HER ABOUT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A VERIED RESPONSE AND IT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL I CERTAINLY HAD PARTNERS THAT LOVE THE PILL OR AT LEAST IN SEEM TO MIND IT I'VE HAD SOME THAT HATED IT AND LIKE LIKE NO WAY TRY THAT NEVER WILL UM OR YOU KNOW JUST WENT WITH OTHER FORMS OF CONTRACEPTION OR WHATEVER REASON WERE NOT USING CONTRACEPTION SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION OUT THERE HOW DOES ONE EXPLORE THAT WITHOUT RISK OF PERMANENT DAMAGE IT SOUNDS LIKE TRULY PERMANENT DAMAGEIS UNLIKELY U IN WON ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS A YO KNOW IS THE RING UM A COPPER IUD OH NO ANY SORT OF LONG ACTING HORMINAL CONTRACEPTIVE WEVE SEEN WI WE THAT'S WHAT WE CONSULPATIONS ON AS IF THEIR HAVING ISSUES WITH OAL CONTRACEPTIVES EVEN IF THEY COME WITH PALVIT PAIN AND THEIR HONORAL CONTRACEPTORS I'LL TEL THEM YOU NOW WHAT JUST STOP BECAUSE MAYBE THE ENGN THE FACT OF ON THE ANDRG AN RECEPTORS A ESTERDAN RCEPTORS IS EFFEPTING YOU KNOW THE LIBRICATION EOITHER THINGS WERE NOT SURE BUT YOU AN'T YOU STOP IN GO GET A LONG ACTING CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD WI CAN IUD LI CANIT AND UDS AR IUD SAFE AND HERE WI SHOULD PROBABLY AY OOK A COPPER AUD IS ONE FORM YUORN'TA MENTION A FEW OF THE OTHER FORM NO I DON'T OUDESCRIBE I UDS BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THEIR VERY SAIFE OF COURSE THERE'S RISK WITH ANY SORT OF YOU KNOW IT'S A THE PRECEDER YOURE INCERTING AND I UD SO THEIR S OBVIOUSLY SOME SMALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT IT IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FORM OF CONTRACEPTION IF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHY THE COPPER IUD IS AN EFFECTIVE FORM OF A CONTRACEPTION A COPPER R IS A LIKE THE THIRD RAIL FOR SPERM AS I UNDERSTAND IT SO MUCH SO THAT AM I WAS ABLE TO FIND SOME EVIDENCE FOR THIS IN THE MEDICAL TEXT BOOKS THAT A IN THE OLD DAYS AS I SAY A PROSTITUTES WHO WANTED TO AVOID A PREGNANCY WOULD PUT COPPER PENNIES IN THEIR VIRGINA REALLY I KNOW I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT ANYHOW AND A PLEASE AND AM I DON'T THINK IT'S A FOOL PROOF FORM OF OF A CONTRACEPTION A BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE AT THAT A AN IT HAPPENS SO WHICH IS AMAZING THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE SOMEHOW FIGURED OUT THE COPPER SPERM RELATIONSHIP WHICH ISN'T A GOOD ONE FOR THE SPIRM AND A DEDUCED FROM THAT A BEHAVIOR YE THAT EE OES TRENGINI SUGGEST IF YOUWILL DO THA IDING IS JUST AN INTERESTING MEDICAL FACTOIT A I CAN TELL YOU ONE MOVE ON FROM THE CAIC SO WE WILL A BEFORE DISCUSSING PROSTATE AN ANAL SEX NOT STATED NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER FOR ANY PARTICULAR REASON I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ESCESSORISE A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED SELECTIVE SARATONE AND REUPTAKEN HIBITORS AND OTHER ANTIDOPRESSENCE AM THAT HAVE DISRUPTED THEIR SEXUAL FUNCTION OR THEIR SEXUAL DESIRE N SEEMS IN PARTICULAR A DO YOU SEE A LOT OF THE SINYOR CLINET YOU HEARABOUT IT A WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO ABOUT IT A YOUN OFTENTIMES THESE SEXUAL A ROUSAL OR DISFUNCTION ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH ESSESSORISE ANOTHER MEDICATIONS MAKE THOSE MEDICATIONS PROHIBITIVE AND PEOPLE SO IN A THERATONE AN IS KIND OF THE ANTI TO ORGAS THEM AND SO IN FACT WE WILL USE ESCESSARIYES AWFULLY BOTH FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING PREMATURE EJACULATION SO IT DELAYS EJACULATION AND THEN THERE'S ALSO OTHER CSEXUAL DISFUNCTIONS WE SEE WITH IT AND IT DOES HAPPEN ABSOLATES DOSE DEPENDENT SO AIN SOME CASEES WHEN SOME ONE COMES IN WITH ESCESSARI RELATED DISFUNCT TION IF THEY'RE DOING WELL YOU CAN EITHER TRY TO REDUCE THE DNOSE OR SWITCH THEM TO A A NOTHER ANTE TO PRESENT FOR EXAMPLE WHELL BUTRAN THAT DOES NOT HAVE SUCH SEVERE EFFACTS ON SEXUAL FUNCTION A AND SO YOU CAN ALSO USE LIKE SEALIS AND VIAGARA LIKE YOU'VE TUT WHILE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FORREC TOTHES FUNCTION AS AN ADDITION IF WE CAN'T CHANGE THEIR MEDICATION MANAGEMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW ANDIS GETS A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE KNOW EREC TELLIS FUNCTIONN DEPRESSION OR VERY IN TER RELATED NOW WHAT'S CAUSING WHAT AND WHAT YOU KNOW WHERE DO WE LIKE MAYBE SOMEBODY WENT TO SEE THEIR DALKTOR FOR DEPRESSION WAS ALSO HAVING ISSUE ITH DIRECTIONS AND NOW WHAT YOU IF YOU FIX THE ERECTIONS DOYOU HELP WITH THE DEPRESSION LIKE WHAT YOU KNOW I MEANS TO TAY  EVERYWHERE SHOUTING O I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THEREIS A LOT OF DISCUSSANT HAS TO BE HAD THEIR AS A LOT EASIER TO TALKTO YOURPRIMARY CARE DOCTOR ABOUT DEPRESSION THAN IT IS ABOUT YOUR ERECTIONS AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT T LIKE REALLY DIG INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT YES THERE IT IS DEFINITELY A KNOWN THING WE USE IT TO OUR ADVANTAGE WHEN NEEDED AND A AND IT CAN BE HELPFUL TO TO SWITCH MEDICATIONS OR REDUCE THEDOSES YOU MENTIONED EARLIOR THE TRASIDONE CAN CAUSE A SUSTAINED ERECTION A AND IS TRASIDONE IN THE CATEGORY OF A TOUCHING SO THE CERETONE AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEM YOU KNOW I DON'T REMEMBER THE MECHANISM BUT INTERETINGLY TRASIDONE IS ALSO USED FOR OFF LABEL LIKE AS A THIRD OR FOURTH LINE FOR PREMATURE EJACULATION AS WELL SO AM SO I I DON'T REMEMBER THE THE MECHANISM OFF HINT LET'S TALK ABOUT PROSTRATE AN PROSTRATE HEALTH EARLIER I CEWED UP THAT A THERE'S A GROWING AMTREND TOWARD I EVERTING MORE PROGRESSIVE A MALPHYSICIANS A OR PHYSICIANS WRETREATMEILS AXCUSE ME A THANKS A PRESCRIBING LOW DOSE TO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MILEGRAM SEALIS WHICH IS TO DALAFIL WHICH MAY ASSIST WITH IRECTIONS WUT IT THE  RASIONAL FOR THIS L O DOSE DAILY LODOSEIS NOT CENTERED AROUND IRECTIONS PERSAY IT'S REALLY ABOUT U PROSTRATE HEALTH IMPROVING WHAT FLOAW TOF THE PROSTRATE REDUCING PROSTRATUS U AN EVEN REDUCING THE PROBABILITY OF PROSTATE CANCER U WHAT OTHER SORTS OF THINGS ARE YOU ENCOURGING MEN TO THINK ABOUT MEN THINKING ABOUT THEIR PROSTRATE YET SO BEFORE I FORGET I WANT I MENTION THAT LODOS TODALAFIL IS ACTUALLY A TREATMENT FOR E RECTILE THIS FUNCTION FACT IT WORKS QUITE WELL PARTICULARLY MEN WHO ARE HAVING A LOT OF PYCHOGENIC ISSUES ONE BECAUSE IT DOL HAVE TO REMEMBER TO TAKE A PILL BEFORE SEX IT'S ALWAYS ON BOARD AND YOU KNOW YOUR TAKING FIVE DELEGRAMS EVERY DAY AND IT HAS A THIRTY SIX HOUR HALF LIFE SO OVER EAT OF YOUR KIND OF INCREASING THOSE SO IT CAN ACTUALLY WORK QUITE WELL AND IS A GREAT OPTION FOR A RECTILE THIS FUNCTIONS I DO OT MAKE THAT CAVIAT A IN TERMS OF PROSTRATE HEALTH IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A FACTIVE FOR B P  SHOR ENLARGE PROSTRATE THIS IS A VERY COMMON CONDITION IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT AUTOPSY STUDIES EIGHTY PERCENT OF MEN AT EIGHTY HAVE AN ENLARGE PROSRATE THAT GIT'S VERY VERY COMMON NOW DOES EVERY ONE GET SYMPTOMS AND WHAT'S THE LONG TERM CONCERNS OF IT ND YOU KNOW WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT SO TYPICALLY AS THE PROSTATE ENLARGES IT'S WRIGHT AROUND THE URETHREATS A WALNUT SHAPED GLANCE IT'S UNDERNEATH THE BLADDER AROUND THE ERETHRA AND IT CAN NARROW THE OURETHRARE THE PTUBE AND SO OVER TIME YOU CAN IMAGINE LIKE IF YOURE I ALWAYS GIVE THIS EXAMPLE IF YOUR SUCKING FROM A STRAW WRIHT YOU'R DRINKING FROM A STRAW IF YOU'VE A WIDE DIAMETER STRAW IT'S REALLY EASY TO DRINK IF YOUR STRAW GETS REALLY NARROWLIKE SAT YOU TAKE A COFFEE STRAW HEN YOU DRINK OUT OF THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DRINK VERY SIMILARLY IT CAN BECOME VERY DIFFICULT TO EARNATE IF YOU HAVE AN ENLARGED PROSTRATE NOW WHAT CAUSES ENLARGE PROSTRATE THERE'S A WHOLE WHOST OF FACTORS LOW THEM RGENETICS IF YOUR FATHER GRANDFATHER HAD A LARGE PROSTRATE YOUR PROBABLY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE AN ENLARGE PROSTRATE U DO WE KNOW EXACTLY  HOW TO PREVENT THAT NOT EXACTLY BUT WE KNOW HOW TO MEDIATE THE SYMPTOM S A LITTLE BIT SO THE OTHER SYMPTOMS YOU'LL SEE BEFORE YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY YEARNITING IS SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE OVER ACTIVITY SO YOU'LL SEE A YOUR BLATTERS RESPONDING TO HAVING TO PUSH HARD AGAINST THAT NARROW YOURE RETHRAGED PUSH HERE AND OUT SO IT'S HAVING MORE URGENT SE LIKE THE SUDDEN DESIRE TO GO THE BATHROOM THAT YOU CAN'T DELAY YOURE MAY BE GOING MORE FREQUENTLY AND VERY OFTEN YOU'RE GOING MORE OFTEN AT NIGHT AND SO THOSE RE KIND OF THE FIRST SIGNS PEOPLE WILL SEE AND THEN OVER TIND IT MAY BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO EMPTY THE BLTTER YOU MIGHT SEE SOME HESITANCEE LIKE YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOUR STREAM TO START OR IT STOPS AND STARTS A AND SO THOSE IUN  ORGARS THAT CAN'T EMPTY THAT CUTS NOT GA TO DRIPS OR A VERY WEAK STREAM AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN OVER A LIFETIME NOW WHAT WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP A YOU KNOW SEALIS HELPS RELAX THOSE THOSE THE FIBROS SMOOTH MUSCLE THE PROSTECTS THAT ALLOWS YEARN TO PASS MORE EASILY THERE'S ALSO OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT YOU CAN TREAT VERY OFTEN FLOW MAXS A OR OTHER ALFA BLOCKERS ARE HEALPFUL IN THAT AREA A IN TERMS OF LIKE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN GENERAL FOR BLATER HEALTH PROSTATE HEALTH THERE CERTAIN THINGS TARE IRRITANTS TO THAT AREA AND SO WHAT I TELL PEOPLE AND NOT EVERY ONE'S AFFECTED THE SAME WAY SO I DON'T WANT PEOPLE THAT BE LIKE OH I GOT A STOP ALL THESE DELICIOUS THINGS THAT EAT AND DRINK BUT CERTAINLY IT CAN BE USEFUL TO JUST PAY ATTENTION SO LIKE IF YOU SAY YOU DRINK COFFEE EVERY DAY AND YOU FIND YOUR SELF ARING THE BATHROM MA LOT IF YOU LIMIT YOURE KAINE AND TAKE YOU MIGHT SEE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BATHONPLAYIS OFTEN BECAUSE KAFINE IS A BLATTER IRRITANT SO THAT CAN BE COFFEE TEA CHOCOLATE YOU KNOW THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT HAVE CAFINE IN THEM ENERGY DRINK SOME AS YOU'LL FORGET THEY HAVE KAINE IN THEM A AND SO LIMITING THAT MAY IMPROVE YOUR SYMPTOMS A ALCOHOL ALSO IS A BLATER IRRITANT AND THESE HAVE ACTUL BEEN SETTIG N ANIMAL MODELSAN YOU'LL SEE THAT THE BLATTER CONTRACTS MORE OFTEN WHEN THEY'RE GIVEN THESE SORTS OF SUBSTANCES A AND IT'S DOSE DEPENDENT AND SOME PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY HABITUATE OR GET USED TO A CERTAIN DOSE OF KAFINE S IF YOU'RE DRINKING COFFEE EVERY DAY YOU MAY HAVE LESS SYMPTOM THAN SOME ONE WHO DRINKS AT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AM OTHER THINGS CAN BE A SOMETIMES CARBONATED BEVERAGES SPICY FOODS OR A CITIC FOODS THOSE SORTS OF THINGS CAN ALSO IRRITATE THE BLALINGS O SOMETIMES LIMITING THOSE THINGS MAY BE HELPFUL IN THOSE SITUATIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT'S VERY INFORMATIVE EM YEARS AGO THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT EM BICYCLE SEAT CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE PROSTRATE MAYBE EN SEXUAL THIS FUNCTION EM THA STILL A THING I THOUGHT THEY PUT GRUVES INTO THE THE SEATS  BUT AVE ALSO IN READING ON THE INTRNETE I CADN'T DO A DEEP DIVE ON READIT BUT EM SEEMS I WOMEN ARE REPORTING SOME BLATTERIN CONTINENTS FROM EXCESSIVE BICYCLE SEAT USE MAYBE VEN E EXERCISE BIKE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ROWE BY YES SO THIS IS AT GREAT POINTS SO CYCLING IF YOU THINK ABOUT AT RAT YOUR SITTING ON YOUR PARANIUM WHICH IS THAT SPACE FOR MEN BETWEEN THE SCRODUM AND THE ANAS FOR WOTING THE VIGINA AND THE ANES AND RIGHT THERE RUNS YOUR PUDENDAL ARDERY IN YOUR PUDENDAL NERVE WHICH ARE AGAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR BLOODFLOW AND NERVE FUNCTION TO THE AREA SO THE MOST COMMON THINGS WE SEEIN PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW AM WHO ARE REALLY HIGH VOLUME CYCLARES NOW THE STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT LIKE A MAYBE THEY DOST THREE HUND R FIFTY CALOMETER RACE SOR THEY THEIRE OUKNOW BIKING THREE TIMES THE WEEK FOR SIXTY MENTS BUT THERE'S NO LIKE CONSISTENCY BUT THEIR SEEING PRETTY HIGH RATES OF GENITAL NUMBNESS SO LIKE UP TO FIFTY PER CENT AND ALSO IN MEN ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION IN WOMEN YOU'LL ALSO SEE NUMNETS BUT BECAUSE SENSATION IS TA BIG PART OF AROUSAL YOU'LL ALSO SEE KIND OF DECREASED LUBRICATION MAY BE DECREASED AROUSAL AS WELL IN WOMEN AND SO HOW CAN YOU PREVENT THAT THE REASON IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU'R SITTING PARTICULARLY FYOUR LEADING FORWARD LIKE COMPETITIVE BIKERS YO WERE AERO WRITING YOU'RE PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE THE BEAK OF THE BICYCLE SEAT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW MOST OF THAT IS NOT YOUR WEIGHTS NOT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY SO THE GOAL IS TO TAKE A BIKE SEAT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SIT COMFORTABLY ON YOUR ISSUE TO VEROCITIES AND POSTURES A HUGE PART OF YOUR PUBLIC SFO I NO WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT EARLIER BUT SITTING YOU KNOW WITH GOOD POSTURE AND NOT A KIND OF SLOUCTING OR LEANING FORWARD ACAN ACTUALLY REALLY DO WONDERS FOR YOUR PELVIC FLAR SO FOLCASSING ON POSTURES HELPFUL BUT ALSO WHEN BIKING PLASSURES HELFAL SO THEY'VE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THI DATE ON THEY FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARROW RIDE MEANING LEAN FORWARD A ARE PEOPLE WHO USE NARROW BIKE FEATS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ISSUES AND SO YOU WANT TO GET KIND OF A NOSELESS SEET AND A WIDEER SEAT THA THE CUT OUTS ACTUALLY WHEN THEY LOOKED AT KIND OF MECHANICS OF THE CUT OUTS THEY'LL SEE HIGHER PRESSURE AROUND THE OPENING SO 'S CTUALLY NOT GOOD TO HAVE A A BIKE WITH A CUT OUT A BIKESYT WITH A CUT OUT BECAUS THEY'VE SEEN AT LEAST WITH SOME OF THE CUT OUTS THAT THE PRESSURE ACTUON BECOMES HIGHER ON THE ARELITS RIGHT AROUND IT VERY IMPORTANT POINT A I DON'T CYCLE I DON'T LIKE THE EXERCISE BY SOMETHONRA THE SALT BIKE FOR WHIT HAS THE BIG SEAT THE AE FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT AM I OS WONT AT ONE OF ONE THING BECAUSE I SHINK THAT IDOAN AT AMAKE PEOPLE NOT CYCLE I THINK IT'S REALLY VALUABLE CYCLING IS A GREAT EROBIC EXERCISE HAS LOTS OF BENEFIT FOR CARDVASK THEIR HEALTH BUT A THERE WAS ACTUALLY ANOTHER STUDY THAT LOOKED AT PEOPLE WHO WERE PARTS OF SPORTS CLUBS SO THEY WERE LIKE SWIMMERS RUNNERS AND AND AND CYCLIS AND THEY LOOKED AT RATES OF DISFUNCTION AND THEY FOUND THAT ACTUALLY THE RATE OF ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION WAS NOT DIFFERENT BETWEEN RUNNERS SWIMMERS AND CYCLER SO MAYBE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THOSE OTHER SIYS WERE JUST LOOKING AT CYCLERS THAT MAY BE IT'S JUST THE GENERAL RATE OF ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION IN THAT POPULATION AT THAT POINT IN TIME SO I DON'T THE NUBNESS IS DAFFL AN ISSUE THE ERECTILE THIS FUNCTION MAYBE MAYBE NOT SO YOUS SELVE A COUPLE OF MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND BODILY YOUVE BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS WITH YOU A TIME AND IN PO AN'T HERE SO I'VE REALLY APPRECIATED R SURE LISTENERS TO IS WELL ANALSECS YOU RECENTLY DID A POST DESCRIBING THE MULTIPLE REASONS WHY WOMEN DO OR DO NOT HAVE ANAL SECS YES IT VERY INTERESTING POST VERY INTERESTING STUDY THE AT HOVERT YET AND YOU A EXPLAINED IT VERY CLEARLY UM I'M GUESSING THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW BUT PERHAPS SOME OTHER STUDIES AS WELL ABOUT THISE UM LET'S TALK ABOUT NL SECS AND I MAYBE IF YOU COULD JUST OFFER SOME OF THE THE KEYBLLET POINTS THAT YOU LEARN FROM THE LITERATURN FROM YOUR CLINICAL PRACTICE U YOU KNOW HOW FREQUENT IS IT UM I WITH PROTECTION WITHOUT PROTECTION HOW SAFE IS IT UM YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT REASONS PEOPLE DO IT M THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A KIND OF A SILLY QUESTION BUT IT TURNS OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS TOPIC ITS THER ENASTING DATAYEUM EDUCAT US SELL ANAL SECTS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT UM WELL WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ANAL SECTS THE REASON PEOPLE IT' BECOME MORE AND MORE COMMON LETS SAY  IT'S MORE AND MORE HITEROSEXUAL COUPLES ARE DURING THAT WE KNOW THAT A MALE HOMOSEXUAL COUPLES ARE HAVING ANAL SECTS AND I THINK THE ONE THING IS THAT IT'S SAFE IN TERMS OF PREGNANCY RIT YOU'RE NOT GOIN THO GET PREGNANT FROM ANAL SECS WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE DO ENGAGE IN ANAL SECTS YOU THINK THUS THE REASON PEOPLE ARE DOING IT MORE FREQUENTLY NO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ONE OF THE REASONBUT A IN GENERAL A THE ISSUE WITH ANAL SECS IS THAT PEOPLE FORGET TO USE PROTECTION LIKE A CONDEMN FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE SECUREATHONS MEN IN FECTIONS ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKEELY WITH ANAL SECTS THAN THEY ARE WITH VAGUNAL PENETRATIVE INTERCOURSE BECAUSE THE ANAL TISSUE IS VERY THIN AND FRIABLE SO WHEN YOU PENETRATE THE ANAS PARTICULARLY IF YOU HAVE ANY TRAMA A YOU CAN HAVE YOU KNOA YOU CAN HAVE BLOODLOSS AND THAT BLOODLOSS CAN THEN EASILY MORE EASILY TRANSMIT SETUALY TO THE MEN IN FECTION SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO USE A CONDEMN AND USE ADEQUATE LUBRICATION THE ANIS DOES NOT MAKE ANY OF ITS INDOGENOUS LUBRICATION YOU HAVE TO USE LUBRICANT THE OTHER INTERESTING THING ABOUT ANAL SEX IS THAT THE ANIS P GE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE VAGINAL PEAGE SO YOU WANT TO USE SPECIFIC LUBRICANS THAT OUR ISO OSMOULDER TO ANAL PEACHS YOU CANNAVE TO LOOK AP ANAL LUBRICANTS AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT LUBRICANS BUT GENERALLY THERE IS WATER BASED SYLICONE BASED OIL BASE LUBRICANS WATER BASED ARE THE MOST EASILY ACCESSIBLE A SYLICONE BASED AR A LITLE MORE SLIPPERY AND LAST LITTLE LONGER AND OIL BASED ALSO LAST LONGER BUT ARE NOT GOOD FOR EASE WITH CONDEMPS SO DEFINALLY USING LUBRICANS AND ALWAYS CEN OF MAKING SURE TO A B IN THE CONTEXT OF COURSE OF BEING CONCENTIAL BUT ALSO LIKE NEVER FORCE ALWAYS TAKE YOUR TIME AND AN THOSE THINGS A REALLY IMPORTANT TO AVOID TRAMA BECAUSE TRAMA CAN HAPPEN AND USUALLY IT'S NOT SEVERE TRAMA WRIT S NOT GOINTO CREATE LONGLASTING PROBLEMS BUT IT IS YOU KNOW INCONVENIENT UNCOMFORTABLE PROBABLY WHERE NOT SEEING AS MUCH OF IT BECAUSE HEY'RE NOT COMING TO THE EMERGEOM OF THEIR HAVING ISSUES UNLESS IT'S REALLY SERIOUS A SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ONE TO PREVENT FROM A SEXUICH AS MENIFECTIONS TO TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND CAUTIOUS AND SOMETIMES IT REQUIRES SOME PREPARATION IF WE GENT OF PENETRATE IN ANAS IT'S GOOD OF OUTON UNOCNA START WITH IT A LARGE GIRTH ITEM YOU GEN A START WITH SOMETHING SMALLER AND CAN WORK YOUR WAY UP A AND THEN I THINK ULTIMATELY WHY PEOPLE HAVE ANAL SEX SO AS I MENTIONE EARLIER THE PROSTATE IS YOU KNOW HIGHLY ENERVATED AND CAN BE A SOURCE OF PLEASURE SO SOME PEOPLE ENJOY THAT PARTICULAR MEN MAY ENJOY ANAL PENETRATION WOMEN AS WELL MAKE ENJOY ANAL PENETRATION BECAUSE OF THE ENERVATION AROUND THEIR THE PALVIC FLOOR A AND YOU KNOW SO THAT'S CERTAINLY REASONABLE TO DO SO AS FAR AS WY PEOPLE ENGAGE IN ANAL SEX SO SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE AS I MENTION THEIR TRINA AVOID VAGIAL PENETRATION EITHER TO AVOID PREGNANCY OR MAYBE A YOU MENSTUATION OR OTHER REASONS A SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO DO SOMETHING SPEC SAL WITH THEIR PARTNER LIKE THEY FEEL LIKE THIS IS MY SPECIAL THING WITH THIS PARTNER THAT I DO WITH THEM AND SO IT MAY BE SOMETHING KIND OF LIKE A GIFT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETIMES IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY A THEY HAVE TO AND THIS PARTICULAR STUDE I LOOK AT THER'S ACTUALY NOT A LOT OF STUDIES ON WY PEOPLE ENGAGE IN ANEL SEX AND THIS PARTICULAR STUDY THAT IAD TALKED ABOUT ON MY CHANNEL AR MANSTERGAM WITH A TALKING ABOUT WHY THEY THEY SPECIFICALLY REGOD DRUG USERS AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD USED DRUGS PRIOR TO USING TO ENGAGING IN AL SEX AND I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT IDEAL YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE KIND OF IN THE RIGHT STATE OF MINED FOR CONSENT AND A AND SAFETY PURPOSES AND SO I THOSE WERE COMDING COMMON REASONS WHAT ABOUT INFECTION NOT RELATE TO SECTUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION  MY PRESUMPTION IS THERE IS A HIGHER REST WITH ANAL SEX  THAN THERE IS WITH OTHER  OTHER FORBET YOUN VASUAL INTERCOURSE WORL SEX ET CETERA A WHAT IS THEIRE EVIDENCE FOR THAT A NOT NECESSARILY IT'S MORE ABOUT SECUES HAS BEEN AN INFECTIONS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I'S RARE YOU CAN SOMETIMES AING THE RARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE KIND OF COMMENT ON LIKE ANAL IN CONTINENTS TEMPORARILY OR THINGS IKE THAT VERY RARE A MOSTLY IT'S IT'S JUST SECTUALLY CH HAS BEEN INFECTIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE MORE IT'S MORE EASY TO CREATE BLEADING THREANL SEX IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL AND ORE PEOPLE DOING ANIMALS BEFORE INAL SEC TO PREVEN VECTORIAL INFECTION OR SECJUST  LIKE ET'S AT CON OF SOME PEOPLE ARE SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE MAKING SURE THEY'RE EVACUATED FULLY A THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW MEDIA ARTICLES ABOUT LIKE WHAT YOU SHOULD EAT BEFORE TO KIND OF KEEP YOUR GUT YOU KNOW HEALTHY AND AVOID KIND OF LOOSE STOOLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT A BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS YOU CAN LOOK UP TO MAKE IT SAFE AND HEALTHY AND I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS AND THEIR MAYBE THEY'VE TURNED IT OFF ALL RIGHTY  A AND I THINK WE CAN EXPECT A VERIED RESPONSE TO SASCUSSION BUT IT'S HAPPENING AFTHER THAAPPARENTLY WITH A INCREASIN N FREQUENCY YEAND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING AVALABILITY OF PINOGRAPHY WHERE IT'S VISUALIZED MORE OR IF A IU DNREALLY KNOW I BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS MORE GOING ON IN HAD OUR SEXUAL COUPLES AND PIRE AS A FINAL CATEGORY OF QUESTION A I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE POSTS YOU'VE DONE ABOUT HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF SEXUAL DESIRE IN SEXUAL FUNCTION AM ON THIS PARDCAST I ALWAYS SAY ALWAYS ALWAYS A WE EMPHASIZE BEHAVOR OL TOOLS FIRST DOS AND DON'T BECAUS SE OF THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IN U A IN ALL CONTECTS A THERE IS OF COURSE A ROLL FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SOMETIMES OFTENTIMES PEOPLE CAN'T DO THE THINGS AND AVOID THAT CERTAIN THINGS THEY WANT TO BECAUSE OF DEPRESSIVE STATES ANXIOUS STATES  CETERAAN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CAN SERVE A ROLL BUT I DO BELIEVE THE GOAL IS ALWAYS A BEHAVIORS FIRST THEN OF COURSE THINGS LIKE ADEQUATE SLEEP NUTRICIAN HEALTHY SOCIAL INTERACTION ALL OF THAT STUFF I EXERCISE BUT WE DO OFTEN TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AM BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A I THINK IN IMPORTANT CATEGORY OF INOVER THE COUNTER COMPOUNDS THAT CAN PLAY A ROLL AN A I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT TONGAALI THIS INDONESIAN HERB I THINK IT CAN BE MALATION AS WELL BUT THIS INDONETION A ERBISTYPICALLY THE ONE THAT A IE AWARE A WORKS BEST FOR A MILD LIIDO INHANCEMENT M SOMETIMES A ESPECIALLY THE CASE OF PEOPLE TAKING ESCESSORISE A IT CAN ENHANCE LIBITO TO OVERIDE SOME OF THE A CHALLENGES WITH ESSESSOR I INDUCE RODUCTION IN LIBITO AND GENERALLY EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE N ON OURASCESSORISE I HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO TAKE TONGAALI AND GET A LIBIDO INCREASES ALSO THINGS LIKE MACKA RUDE WHICH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THESE THINGS WORK EXACTLY PROBABLY SOME FREEING UP OF TESTASTERON TONGADALI MAYBE SOME QUARTERS ALL SUPPRESSION AS WELL A MAYB SOME ESTROGEN RECEPTORMODULATION WITH MOCKAROUT MAY BE SOME DOPOMANURGET TONE CHANGES AM SCHILAGY NOM THIS IVATIC ERBAM WHICH THERE IS AT LEAST ONE STUDY A THAT I THINK ITS DONE WELL THAT AM SHOWS INCREASES IN EPHASAPHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMON WITH A SCHILAGY USE WHAT YOUR THOUGHT SOMETHINGS LIKE TONGAALE MOCHA RUTE SHILAGY AM HOW HEU TALHT YOUR PATIENTS ABOUT THIS STUFF YES SO I THINK THAT A YOU I SEE TLEAST MY PATIENT POPULATION IS STILL IN THE BEHAVIOURAL MANAGEMENT PLACE RIGHT A THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF SEXUAL THIS FUNCTION WHETHER IT'S LOW TASASTRA AN RECTILE DIS FUNCTION SEXUAL DIS FUNCTION IS OFTEN COMORBIDITIES RIGHT SO MANAGING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MANAGING DIBES WITH DIET WHICH YOU TALK ABOUT A LOT BUT THE BEST STUDY DIEDAS THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET AT LEAST IN IN THE SEXUAL DISFUNCTION LITERATURE EXERCISE LIKE DOING YOU KNOW BOTH PARTY OF ASCULAR EROBIC EXERCISE BUT ALSO DOING RESISTANCE TRAINING PARTICULARLY LIKE LARGE MUSCLE GROUPS A AND AND THEN A YOU KNOW REALLY WORKING ON REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE AND AND PREVENTING DIBEDIES AND THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE REALLY KEEAND I KNOW WE TAUGHT YOU TALK ABOUT THEM ALL ON THIS POD CAST BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE GETTING READY FOR FOR EXAMPLE WE DO A SURGERY FOR ERECTO TIS FUNCTION CAL PINAL PROSTHESIS SO THIS IS LIKE END OF THE LINE NOTHING'S WORKING THEY CAN'T GET N ERECTION AT ALL AND IT CAN BE O AND AND THEY MAY HAVE DIBEDES AS A CAUSE OF IT WHEN WE SAY YOU DO YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR HUMA GLOBAN A ONE SEE BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL TO DO SURGERY I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW QUICKLY THESE MEN CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIORS FORSAKE OF ERECTION FOR SAKE OF ERECTIONS SO I THINK THAT REALLY IF I CAN SAY ONE THING BEFORE YOU DO A SUPPLEMENT THAT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH I THINK THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO TRY THA A I WOULD TRY ONE AT A TIME TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING AND SO YOU'RE NOT TING A BUNCH OF THINGS AND NOT KNOWING WHAT EXACTLY'S WORKING AND REALIZING THAT THEY'RE NOT K AN A WORK IMMEDIATELY IF YOU TAKE SOMETHING THAT WORKS IMMEDIATELY IT'S PROBABLY GOT A PITY FIVE INHIBITAR MIXED IN THERE AND SO IT'S GEEN A KIND OF BILED OVER TIME AND YOUR NECY CHANGES OVER TIME BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT I RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE IS IMPROVING THEIR DIET EXERCISING GETTING GOOD SLEEP AS YOU KNOWANT BUS TASTASTRON AND EVEN YOU KOW YOU MENTION THIS ALL THE TIME BUT GETTING EARLY MORNING LIHE BUT IT'S IT'S BENEFICIAL FOR TESTASTERN AS WELL BECAUSE YOUR RELY HELPING RELEASED HASTASON WITH THE CIRCADIAN BIOLOGY SO I THINK THAT THOSE THINGS THAT I CAN'T STRAS ENOUGH LIKE HOW VALUABLE THEY ARE AND IF YOU'R SMOKPING QUIT SMOKING IT WILL KILL YOUR ERECTION VABIN AND VAPIN NO AND THEN LASTLY IF YOU ARE DEVELOPING TRUE ORGANIC IMPOTENCE MEING THAT THERE'S A A BIOLOGIC PROBLEM THAT'S CAUSING YOUR SEXUAL DISFUNCTION THEN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET YOUR CARDIO ASCULAR HEALTH ASSASSED BECAUSE ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF MEN WHO DEVELOP E RECTILE THIS FUNCTION SEVEN YEARS LATER WILL HAVE A CARDY OF ASCULAR OVAT IT IS THE CANARYAN THE COAL MINE MEANING THAT YOU KNOW IT'S THE SIGN THAT YOU MAY BE DEVELOPING CARDY OF ASCULAR PROBS ARE LIKE ENDOTELIAL DISFUNCTION THAT'S FIRST PRESENTING IN THE PENUS OR IN THEIR SEXUAL ORGANS AND WE KNOW THIS PROBABLY IS THE SAME FOR WOMEN WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE DATA YET I KNOW A GOOD NUMBER OF WOMEN THAT TAKE TONGUA ALY  IN PART I THINK ON THE RECOMMENDATION ALTHOUGH I WONT BECLARE I NEVER RECOMMENDED IT IT'S AN OFFER OF SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE COULD TRY IF THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING ELSE CORRECTLY IN RITACESS EM WITH CONSULTING YOUR PHYSICION OF COURSE EM AND THEY TO SOME OF THEM HAVE A REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN LIBITO IN DESIRES THE MOST SOEM YET AND  THE SHILOGY IS LESS KNOWN ABOUT THE EM DISTINGUISHING QUALITY VERSES LOW QUALITY SOURCES OF SHILAGY IS HARDER DOSING IS HARD IT COMES AS THIS TAR TYPICANTYPICALLY EM MAYBE MORE SCIENCE ON SHIELAS YOU WL COME OUT THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE COULD EM GET GET BEHIND IT A BET AN OR RIGHT NOW'M SHORT UPON THE YA MAYBE IF YOU ARE AN ADVENTURE YOU MIGHT TRY IT BUT I'M NOT A IT'S NOT ONE THAT I NORMALLY THROW TOF THE TOP OF THE LIST I THINK THAT LIKE ELS THE TRALE IS IS PRETTY GOOD OSTUA CONDUCT FOR STRUST PRODUCTION WHICH ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR SEXUAL FUNCTION AND TON CADALY HAS REASONABLE DATA A I THINK THERE YOUKNOW THERE IS REASONABLE DATA N THESE THINGS I THINK THE WEVE THAT YOU TALK ABOU LL THE TIME EXAMINE DOT COM IS A GREAT PLACE TO LOOK AT THOT A AND YOU KNOW I AS TIKE AS TI THINK IT'S REASONABLE THEIR SMALLER STUDIES THERE NOT A YOU KNOW THERE IS BY IS IN MANYS TATYES BUT THERE THEREING NOT THE THERE IS EFFORT DOT IN THIS AREAND TERE'S NEVER GAN TO BE A REALLY HIGH QUALITYES TIENCE NO ONE CAN REALLY FIND THAT I THINK IMS I THINK OUR EXPECTATIONS IN TO BEEL TEMPERED WHEN IT COMES TO

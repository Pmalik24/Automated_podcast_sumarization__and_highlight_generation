THIS SERIES YOU LAID OUT FOR US IN VERY STRUCTURED WAY WHAT TRUE MENTAL HEALTH LOOKS LIKE ESENTIALLY WHAT WE SHOULD ALL BE ASPIRING TO AND TOUCHED ON THESE THEMES OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS VERB STATES REALLY WAYS OF BEING IN THE WORLD IF THAT ALLOW EVERYBODY TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF WELL BEING TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF THEMSELVES IN A WAY THAT IS KIND TO THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS AND REALLY TO FEEL GOOD AND DO GOOD N THEIR LIFE AND WITHOUT QUESTION THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT I YOU ALSO SPELLED OUT FOR US THESE TWO PILLARS THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND THE FUNCTION OF SELF THAT CONSIST OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT FROM WHICH GEISER UP ORAND OF IT YOU DON'T GIVE RISE TO THESE FEELINGS OF EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND REMINDED US SEVERAL TIMES THAT WHEN WE ARE CHALLENGED WHEN WE'RE NOT DOING AS WELL AS WE WOULD LIKE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK BACK TO THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO ARRIVE OR RE ARRIVE AT THE SENSE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THINK IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL FOR US IF YOU COULD JUST RECAP THE OVER ALL MODEL AND BECAUSE IT HAS THE COMPONENTS THAT I JUST MENTION BUT SOME SUBTLETY AND SOME REALLY KEY ASPECTS OF THESE PILLARS STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF I THINK IF PEOPLE KEEP IN MIND FOR TO DAY'S EPISODE WHICH IS ABOUT CHALLENGES THE PEOPLE COMMONLY FACE AND EVEN A IF YOU WILL FENA TYPES THAT WE SEE COMMONLY OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE TO HAVEN'T HEARD OF FENA TYPES PNA TYPES ARE A THE TYPICAL APPEARANCE OF SOMETHING SO THERE IS THE FOENA TYPE OF THE ANXIOUS PERSON THE NA TYPE OF THE PERSON WHO JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET OUT OF A RUT THERE'S THE FOENA TYPE OF THE TRIMTROMATIZED PERSON AND AND THESE THINGS PLAY OUT DIFFERENTLY IN INDIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS MEN AND WOMEN BOYS AND GIRLS BUT WE'RE GOING TO VISIT A MANY OF THE MOST COMMON PENA TYPES OUT THERE AND THINK ABOUT HOW TO DO BETTER BE BETTER FEEL BETTER THROUGH THE LENDS OF THE MODEL THAT A WE SPELLED OUT IN EPISODE ONE AND OF COURSE IF PEOPLE HAVE NOT SEEN OR HEARD EPISODE ONE TODAY'S DISCUSSION WILL STILL BE ENTIRELY ACCESSIBLE TO THEM SO IN KEEPING WITH THAT IF YOU COULD JUST A GIVE US A NOVER OF VIEW OF OF WHAT THIS A STRUCTURE OF THE HEALTHY SELF LOOKS LIKE AS A ROAD MAP FOR A WEWERL HEADED TO DAY THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH WE VISITING THE PILLARS IS AS I THINK THE BEST PLACE TO START BECAUSE THERE REALLY ARE ROUTS TO UNDERSTANDING AND IF WE UNDERSTAND THAND WE CAN STRATAGIZE WE CAN MAKE CHANGE WHY WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER SO THAT THAT THE FIRST PILLAR THE STRUCTURE OF SELF STARTS WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND BY THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED BIOLOGICAL SUPERCOMPUTER THAT FIRING A MILD MINUTE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE IN US AND IS THROWING UP TO THE SURFACE ALL SORTS OF THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AND STATES THAT THEN THE CONSCIOUS MIND APPREHENDS THAN OUR WARENESS COMES INTO PLAY AND THEN WE HAVE DEFENSE MECHANISMS THAT IS WOULD RISE UP FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND THEY THEY CIRCLE INSTED OF GIRD THEMSELVES AROUND THE CONSCIOUS MIND WHICH THEY CAN DO IN AN UNHEALTHY WAY OR IN HEALTHY WAY OR ANY ANYTHING IN BETWEEN AND THEN THE THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE SSOT OF THE NEST AROUND ALL OF THAT AND ITS FROM THE CHARACTER STRCTURE THAT WE THAT WE ARE ENGAGING IN THE WORLD IN THE WAYS THAT WERE ENGAGING WHET ITS OUR ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WORLD AROUND US AND THE IDEAS THAT THE SELF GROWS OUT OF THAT IT GROWS OUT OF THAT NEST SITTING ON TOP OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO THE CONSCIOUS MIND RISING ABOVE THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND AND IF WE GO BACK TO THAT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES OUF WE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND STATES OF HEALTH AS WELL AS STATES OF UNHAPPINESS OR OR STATES THAT AREN'T HEALTHY RIGHT BY BY GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE STRUCTURE WE CAN LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT AND THE OTHER SIDE THAT THE THE OTHER PILLAR IS THE THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND IT REALLY STARTS WITH THE SELF AWARENESS RIGHT THE WERNESS IT A THERE IS AN EYE RIGHT I AM IN THE WORLD RIGHT IS TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THE DAY ARE GAN PASS TO DAY AND I CAN BE DOING ONE THING OR ANOTHER IM IM SO I'M TO SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT EXTENT DECIDING HOW MYGANA ENGAGE IN THE WORLD AROUND ME DURING THAT TIME SO ON TOP OF THAT ARE THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND ACTIONS A DEFENSE MECHANISMS REMEMBER UNCONSCIOUS SO THERE'S A LOT THEN GOING ON INSIDE OF US THAT'S DETERMINING SORT OF THE FIELD SET OF OPTIONS RIGHT THERE MAY BE A LOT OF AUTOMATICITY THAT NARROWS DOWN THE SET OF OPTIONS OF WHAT WE MY ENTERTAIN WHAT WE MAY BE AWARE OF WHAT WE MAY DECIDE AND THAT COULD HAPPEN FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE DEPENDING UPON THE HEALTH OF THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS BUT ON TOP OF THAT LIES SALIENT SO THE IDEA THEN WE WOULD NEXT VISIT OKA WHAT WE PANG ATTENTION TO RIT WHAT WHAT'S COMING FROM INSIDE WHAT'S COMING FROM OUTSIDE AND WE HAVE TO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO MANY MANY MANY MANY THINGS IN ORDER TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHATEVER OUR ATTENTION IS ALIGHTED ON AT THE MOMENT SO IT'S A COMPLEX PROCESS IAND IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES SO AFTER THINKING ABOUT THE THE DEFENCE MECHANISMS IN ACTION AKE THE UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF HOW WE'RE ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD THEN NEXT TO CONSIDER IS SLIENTS WHICH IS SORT OF WHERE DOES THE MIND ARRIVE AT AT REST OR WHERE DOES THE MIND TREND TOURIS IS IT SOMETHING INTERNAL IS IT SOMETHING EXTERNAL WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS WERE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO IN ORDER TO PAY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING AND IS THAT THING HEALTHY IS IT NOT HEALTHY IS IT SERVING US WELVE SO THERE'S SO MUCH TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT SALIENTS AND THEN THE NEXT STEP BEYOND THAT IS UNDERSTANDING BEHAVIOR HOW ARE WE ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD AROUND US WHAT ARE OUR BEHAVIOR AL CHOICES WHAT AROUR AUTOMATIC BEHAVIORS AND THEN SITTING ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT OR OUR STRIVINGS SO WE WE HAVE A SENSE OF WANTING SOMETHING IN THE WORLD AROUND US LK WHAT IS THAT AND HOW WE TRYING TO GET TO IT AND HOW DOES IT MAKE US FEEL SO IF WE LOOK AT THE TEN ELEMENTS RIT THE FIVE UNDER THE STRUCTURE OFSELVES AND THE FIVE UNDER THE FUNCTION OFSELVES THEN WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IS IS SORT OF LIKE LOOKING AT TEN CABINETS T AND IF WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES WHETHER WE'RE TRYING TO JUST GENERALLY UNDERSTAND OURSELVES OR WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT A PROBLEM GT THEN LOOKING IN ALL TEN OF THOSE CABINETS MAKE SENTENSE RIGHT SOME OF THEM WILL BE BARE MEANING THAT THEY MAY SEEM TO HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH THE PROBLEM WE'RE BRINGING AND WE CAN MAINTAIN AN OPEN MIND RIGHT WE MAY BE LED BACK TO THAT CABINET THERE MAY BE SOMETHING THERE BUT WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS AS IF WE LOO K IN ALL TEN PLACES WE FIND A COUPLE WHERE THERE'S THERE SOME RICH MATERIAL TO EXPLORE SO TO THE EXMARKS THE SPY N THAN WE GO AND WE WE DIG THERE AT A SO TO MIX METAPHORS WE WE DIG IN THE CABINET WHERE WE CAN FIND SOMETHING RIGHT AND THEN IT LEADS FORWARD A PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING AND IF WERE BRINGING THOSE THINGS INTO LINE WHERE WE HAVE A HEALTHY STRUCTURE OF SELF AND HEALTHY FUNCTION OF SELF AND WERE AWARE OF ALL THIS AND WERE WORKING ON IT WERE SELF AWARE AND WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING BUILT ON TOP OF THAT THEN WHAT WE END UP WITH IS A SENSE OF HUMILITY BECAUSE ONE CANNOT BE ANYTHING BUT RESPECTFUL COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY OF OF ALL OF THIS AND UNDERSTANDING HOW DOES IT MANIFEST ITSELF IN US AND IN JUST THE VERY FACT THAT WE CAN WAKE OUR WAYS IN THE WORLD IT IS SO JUST  SO IMPRESSIVE AND IN A WAY I THINK IT BRINGS TO US A RESPECT IST A RESPECT FOR BEING HERE NAVIGATING THE WORLD AND I THINK OF THAT RESPECT IS BORN HUMILITY THE COMPLEXITY OF US THE FACT THAT MILLIONS OF THINGS ARE GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE MILLIONS OF OF A NER TRANSMISSION AND AND A CHINOLOGICAL FUNCTION ALL THIS IS GOING ON UNDTO THI SIRS OME NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT AND THEN IT KICKS UP TO THE SURFACE GENERATES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THE COMPLEXITY AND ALSO THE DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE IT TAKES US TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE WORLD AND I THINK BUILT UPON THAT UNDERSTANDING IS A SENSE OF HUMILITY AND A SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT AND THE HUMILITY AND EMPOWERMENT INACTION RIGHT SO SO EXPRESS RIGHT BECOME AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS YOU SAID OF THE BEGINNING WERTH SEEING AS VERBS WRIGHT THATS HOW WE'RE LIVING LIFE ITS ITS THROUGH THE LEND SO TO SPEAK OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THAT WERE ACTIVELY LIVING AND AGAIN I WOULD PUT FORTH THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT MEASURES OF HUMAN HAPPINESS I A CROSS DISCIPLINES IN A CROSS TIME THIS IS ALWAYS WHAT WE SAY IS IS SOME WAY OF DESCRIBING HOW AGENCY AND GRATITUDE TOGETHER AS VERBS MANIFEST AND THEN CREATE HAP INESS IT'S THE STATE THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO BE IT T BECAUSE FROM THAT STATE OF ACTIVE AGENCY AND ACTIVE GRATITUDE WE ACHIEVE WHAT IT IS THAT I THINK WE'RE REALLY SEARCHING FOR IT AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE BY INFINITE WORDS THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY TO DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS WE MIGHT CHOOSE TO USE WORDS LIKE PEACEFULNESS A SENSE OF PEACE A SENSE OF CONTENTMENT A BEING DELIGHTED BI THINGS I JUST BEING AMAZED AND IMPRESSED BY THINGS IN THE WORLD AROUND US LIKE THIS IS A STATE THAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR AN I THINK WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET TO IT'S THIS T BUT  IT'S NOT THAT THESE THINGS ARE PASSIVE T THESE THINGS ARE COMING FROM THE ACTIVE AGENCY THE ACTIVE GRATITUDE AND THERE THEN INTERACTING WITH A GENERATIVE DRIVE WITHIN US WE HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVE WE HAVE A PLEASURE DRIVE LIKE THIS HAS BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT NOW FOR A LONG LONG TIME WITH IN MENTAL HEALTH AND VALIDATED IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT WHAT HASN'T BEEN VALIDATED AS AT THEY'RE THE ONLY THINGS T WE SEE HUMAN BEINGS STRIVING WE SEE HUMAN BEINGS WANTING BETTER FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE WORLD AROUND THEM WE SEE ACTS OF KINDNESS THAT THAT SEEM TO BE ROOTED TO NOTHING OTHER THAN THE ACTOFE KINDNESS WE HAVE WITHIN US A DRIVE TO KNOW TO UNDERSTAND TO LEARN TO MAKE BETTER AND THAT IS BEEN DESCRIBED AS MANY MANY THINGS ACROSS HUMAN HISTORY BUT I THINK THE WORDS WE MIGHT CHOOSE ARE GENERATIVE DRIVE A DRIVE TO CREATE AND TO MAKE BETTER AND IT'S THET THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AS SOMETHING ACTIVE WITH IN US T THAT IS THEN A LYING WITH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE T THE ACTIVE WAYS IN WHICH WE EXPRESS OURSELVES AND THEN THAT ALL TOGETHER BRINGS US THE PEACE THE CONTENTMENT THE SENSE OF DELIGHT SOMETIMES THAT MAY EXIST IN US IN A STATE OF REST  BUT VERY OFTEN IT'S IN IT'S EXISTING IN US IN A STATE OF ACTIVITY AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE FIND O KNOW THE QOTIQOTE HAPPINESS AF WHAT PEOPLE ARE SEEKING NOT JUST IN I DON'T MEDITATION SOMETIMES WE CAN FIND IT THERE BUT PEOPLE ALSO FIND IT IN IN ACTION RIGHT THEY FIND IT IN DOING THAT THING THAT THEY LOVE TO DO OR A D TAKIN CARE OF SOME ONE IN LEARNING SOMETHING SO WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL THIS WWE CAN THEN WE CAN THEN HAVE A ROUTE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE OF US AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THE CHANGES THAT LET US BE IN THIS STATE WHICH IS REALLY THE STATE THAT WE'RE SEEKING I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU HIGHLIGHT THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ARE VERB STATES  FROM WHICH PIECE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT EMERGE AND ALSO THE WAY THAT YOU EXPLAIN THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT UM IS DISTINCT FROM AGGRESSIVE DRIVES AND PLEASURE DRIVES THAT EXIST IN ALL OF US UM I YOU NOT I SMILING BECAUSE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF A PECE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT WHILE IN ACTION COME TO MINE TO ME FOR ME PODCASTING AND IN PARTICULAR PREPARING FOR A PODCAST AND MIND THE LITERATURE AND FIGURE OUT YO WHERE THE GEMS RESIDE AND WHERE THE CONFUSION COULD COULD EMERGE AND ALL OF THAT BRINGS ABOUT SUCH PIECE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT FOR ME BUT IS IT'S ANYTHING BUT PASSIVE ET'S UM I LIKEWISE A YESTERDAY I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING INTO A A PUPPY I HAT'S BEEN WALL SINCE IVE BON A DOG AND UM DOGS ARE DELIGHTFUL PUPPIES SER PRETIRELY TI EXPERIENCE OF SEEING YOU LET OT WHEN WE MAN I AND AH YOU DID AND AM AND I'M STILL BUZZING FROM THAT SHORT INTERACTION WITH THE PUPPY DOWNSTAIRS E WAMER AND HER PUPPY UM IT JUST THE I DON'T KNOW WHY WHAT I JUST DELIGHT IN IN ANIMALS OF OF MOST ALL KINDS NOT OFIN OF REPTILE SORRY REPTILEPHANDS A SO MUCH BUT I JUST DRIVE SO MUCH ENERGY FROM IT AND FELT LIKE LIFE ENERGY IN THE THE WAY THE ANIMAL IS SORT ATTENTIONALLY SCATTERED IS AMUSING TO ME AS COMPARED TO THE DOG THAT HE WILL EVENTUALLY BE WHICH IS GOING TO BE MORE LINEARN IS THINKING LIKE IT IN CAPSOLATE SO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS I LOVE LIKE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT ET CETERA ANYWAY I HI LIKE THOSE EXAMPLES BECAUSE U THERE'S NOTHING PASSIVE ABOUT IT ITS PURE DELIGHT AND JOY FOR ME I'M AND IT INTERSECTS WITH OTHER DELIGHTS AND JOYS AND I THINK THAT I'M AS YOU DESCRIBE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT IN THESE GENERATIVE FORCES I'M AS WELL AS OTHER FORCES THAT EXIST IN US I THINK IT'S REALLY A CRITICAL THAT A PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT YET THESE ARE NOT STATES THAT YOU SIT DOWN AND AND PLACE YOURSELF INTO ALTHOUGH PERHAPS ONE COULD THROUGH A REFLECTION IN OR MEDITATION OR WAKING UP FROM A REALLY GREAT NIGHT SLEEP THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT THAT I'M THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN FIND OURSELVES A WASH IN IF WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS AND THOSE THINGS CAN OFTENTIMES BE VERY CHALLENGING I'M SO ASSUMING I UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE MODEL IS SPELLED OUT CORRECTLY IM I'M MORE AND MORE DELIGHTED AAT THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT JUST SUCCESSIBLE IN ONE DOMAIN BUT IS SUCCESSIBLE IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT DOMAINS FOR EVERYBODY YET THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YUNIQUE TO MY EXPERIENCE EVEN THOUGH I GIVE EXAMPLES FOR MY OWN LIFE BUT I' THAT WE REALLY ALL DO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS IF WE'RE LOOKING IN THOSE CUPBOARDS THOSE TEN CUPBOARDS AN ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS ND AND TO COMMENING A LITTLE FURTHER ON THE EXPERIENCEOF OF YOU AND THE DOG I SO SO IT WAS A AT EXPERIENCE OF DELIGHT  AND AND YOU ENJOYED IT AND BROUGHT ASANCE OF PEACE AND CONTENTMENT LIKE ALL THAT HAPPENS I THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT'S LINKED TO THAT I BELIEVE THERE'S A STRONG SENSE OF AGENCY IN YOU THAT YOU ARE ENACTING THERE'S A STRONG GRATITUDE IN YOU THAT YOUARE ENACTING YOURE YOUARE HANDLING YOUR LIFE IN A WAY AND ND ALSO FOR ALL OF US GOOD THINGS ALWAYS COME WITH GOOD FORTUNE BUT BUT IT COMES WITH OUR STRIVINGS IN OUR ACHIEVEMENTS THAT YOU'RE IN A PLACE TO DELIGHT IN THAT RIGHT IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY LIG I DON'T LIKE WHAT I'M DOING I'M I'M ANGRY I'M FRUSTRATED THEN THERE'S NO ROOM IN YOU TO TO FIND THE DELIGHT AND THE DELIGHT THAT YOU FIND IS ALSO VERY MUCH LINKED TO THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT IT MAKES ME THINK OF HOW YOU YOU LOVED AND NURTURED CASELLO SO YOU HAVE IT IN YOU TO LOVE AND NURTURE A DOG AND YOU HAVE DONE THAT IN A REALLY WONDERFUL WAY AND THAT GENERATIVE DRIVE IS PART AND PARCEL OF THE DELIGHT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SEE A DOG BECAUSE YOU LOVE DOGS AND YOU THINK ABOUT NURTURING AND IT ALL COMES TOGETHER THE THE THE AGENCY AND THE GRATITUDE EXPRESSED AS VERBS PUT YOU IN A POSITION TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF DELIGHT WHICH IS SO INTERTWINED WITH YOUR GENERATIVE DRIVE WITH A SENSE OF CARETAKING A SENSE OF CREATING THE THE BEYOND SELF BECAUSE ALTHOUGH YOU ENJOYED AND LOVED CASELLO YOU ENJOYED AND LOVED HIS HAPPINESS SO IT ALL COMES TOGETHER AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS IT'S A SIMPLE EXAMPLE BUT LIKE THAT'S LIFE YOU KNOW LIFE HAS ITS IT'S BIG MOMENTS BUT BUT SO MUCH OF OUR LIVES ARE THE SMALLER MOMENTS THAT LINK TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT SMALLER MOMENT IT BECOMES A BIG EXAMPLE I APPRECIATE THAT YOU MENTION COSTELLO FOR LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST THAT IF 'MTURNED INTO EARLY EPISODES A COSTELLO WAS THE SOURCE OF THE THE BACKGROUND SNORING FOR THOSE OF YOU TH AVENUE CAN GO CHAKISA WAS A NINY POUND ENGLISH BLL DOG MASTIVE WHO A WHO HAD MANY SKILLS A THE BEST OF WHICH WAS A SNORING A SO IN ADDITION TO THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE CERTAINLY WANTED A TALK MORE ABOUT TO DAY A YOU MENTION THESE OTHER DRIVES AGGRESSIVE DRIVES AND PLEASURE DRIVES AND MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY IT'S GOING TO BE WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO WRONG WER WERE PEOPLE STRUGGLE WE ARE ALSO OF COURSE GOING TO GO DEEPLY INTO WHERE PEOPLE SUCCEED AND IN PARTICULAR WHERE PEOPLE CAN ASK QUESTIONS OF THEMSELVES ON IN PARTICULAR WHAT IS WORKING FOR THEM AND WHY AS IF ROUT TO UNDERSTANDING HOW TO SIFT THROUGH THOSE CUPBOARDS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND WHY AND COME UP WITH REAL ACTIONABLE ANSWERS AND AND THEN THE ABILITYTO MOVE FORWARD A SO IF IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU TELL US O LIT BUT MORE ABOUT DRIVES GENERALLY LIKE TE YOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR DRIVES I I CAN'T HELP AS A NERROL SCIENTISE BUT DEFAUL TO OKAY THE DOPAMEN CIRCUIT OR THE THE ADOGENIS OPIORD CIRCUIT OR THE A CERTAIN URGIC CIRCUIT BUT YET HOW DO YOU CONCEPTIONALIZE DRIVES WITHIN US AND AND THEN PERHAPS YOU COULD TELL US WHAT THE NATURE OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVES AND PLEASURE DRIVES AND GENERATIVE DRIVES SO THAT THE CONCEPT OF A DRIVE THE DEFINITION OF A DRIVE IS IS SOMETHING THAT'S INTRINSIC TO HUMANS SO WE COULD LOOK AT IT AS E MOTIVATION I MEAN WE DON'T JUST LIE ON THE GROUND AND DO NOTHING UNTIL WE PASSIVELY DIE RIGHT SO SOMETHING IS GOING ON INSIDE OF US THAT IS DRIVING US TO DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THAT AND HISTORICALLY THE THINKING IN THE FIELD DERISING FROM EARLY SECODIDAMIC PRINCIPLES OF TE HE THE THE THEORY IN THE FIELD THAT AS REALLY DOMINATED THE FIELD EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN SO MANY WAYS HAS BEEN THAT THERE ARE TWO DRIVES WITHIN US THAT THERE THERE'S AGGRESSION AND PLEASURE AND AGAIN THESE ARE JUST WORDS RIHTI WE SA WE COULD PUT PUT APPLY MANY MANY WORDS WHICH IS LIFE CROSE WE WANTED TO FIND WHAT THAT MEANS RIGHT SO AGGRESSION EVEN THOUGH WE'RE USING THAT WORD FOR IT BECAUSE THE WORD FOR IT IS COMMONLY USED IGHT BUT IT MEANS IT MEANS O FULLWORD ACTIVE ENGAGEMEN DRIGHT SO SO A GOOD HEALTHY AMOUNT OF AGGRESSION USING THAT WORD FOR THE DRIVE WOULD BE A STRONG SENSE OF AGENCY  SO SO TOO LITTLE AGGRESSION CAN BE A PROBLEM I THEN THE PERSON ISN'T BRINGING THEMSELVES TO BEAR RIGHT SO THERE'S TOO LITTLE IN THE WAY OF SELF DETERMINATION A FURWARD MOVEMENT ITEMPOWERMENT AGENCY RIGHT AND AND IN THE SAME WAY TOO MUCH OF THIS DRIVE BECOMES ACTUAL AGGRESSION SO THE I THE IDEA THAT I WANT MORE AND IF I CAN'T GET IT IN IN CERTAIN WAYS A'LL JUST TAKE RIGHT SO SO THEN SO IT STARTS TO BECOME IN WHAT WE MORE MAP TO THE WORD AGGRESSION WHICH WER SHOULD BE SOMETHING NEGATIVE IN MOST CASES LIKE A DESIRE OR A TENDENCY TO HARM ZHYETS SURELY AS AGGRESSIVE DRIVES GET HIGHER WHICH YOU SEE WHY THEY ARE IN US BECAUSE IT LAS THEY WERE DEFENDING OURSELVES O OR OR YOU DEFENDING A FAMILY MEMBER RIGHT OR OR LIKE AN ENTIRE FAMILY RIGHT THAN IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF AGGRESSION IF YOUR FAMILY IS THREATENED RIHT SO SO THOSE DRIVES ARE IN US WITH WITH EPPOTENTIALLY THOSE HIGH LEVELS FOR A REASON BUT WE WE CERTAINLY ACTS ESS VERY HIGH LEVELS OF AGGRESSION WITH OUT THTHE INDICATION OF PRESERVATION OF LIFE OR PRESERVATION OF SAFETY SO SO TTTHE THOUGHT IS THAT' A DRIVE IN US AND THAT GETS US UP AND OFF THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK RIGHT AND THAT THE OTHER DRI THEN IS PLEASURE WHICH AGAIN DOESN'T JUST MEAN THAT WWE ALL WANT TO BE HEADENISTS RIGHT SO SO PLEASURE COULD BE EVEN THE PLEASURE OF RELIEF AND SAFETY RIGTLICER LIKE WE DON'T WE'RE ALL BACK IN THE CAVE TOGETHER AND WHEND WE ROLL THE STONE IN FRONT OF THE DOOR AH WE'RE SAFE YOU KNOWS WE THROUGHOUT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT YOPLEASURE COMES IN A LOT OF WAYS IT CAN COME TO THE PLEASURE OF FOOD OR OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW FRIENDSHIP ROMANCE SEXTS THAT THEIR LOT OF WAYS WE CAN ACHIEVE PLEASURE CAN BE RELIEF OF THINGS THAT ARE UNPLEASANT OU KNA RELIEF OF PAIN BUT THAT THERE'S A DRIVE TOWARDS THIS INHUMANS WHICH AGAN REALLY DOES MAKE SENSE AND AND TOO LITTLE OF IT AGAIN CAN BE PROBLEMATIC AS THE PERSON THEN ISN'T MOTIVE ATED SO TO SEEK THINGS BECAUSE THER THEY'RE NOT ANTICIPATING OR DON'T RECEIVE GRATIFICATION AND TOO MUCH OF A DRIVE FOR PLEASURE CAN ALSO CREATE PROBLEMS SO SO WE CINNEST SEE HOW THESE TWO DRIVES AOCAY THEY GET US UP AND OFF THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK BUT THE QUESTION IS DO THEY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION BECAUSE IF THEY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING THEN THERE'S NOT REALLY THERE'S NOT ROOM FOR BEHAVIOURS AND CHOICES THAT ARE BEYOND THESELF WI THERE'S NOT AN EXPLANATION FOR THE PERSON WHO I'LL GIVE YOU AN AN EXAMPLE OF I A PERSON I'VE TAKEN CARE OF WHOSE I'S A VERY STRONG SWIMMER YOU KNOW KNOWS HOW TO SWIM AS SWAM THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE WHO WAS IN A PLACE I SAW VIDIO OF IT WHERE THERE'D BEEN A HURRICANE AND THE WAVES WEREO SO FRIGHTENING YOU KNOW THERE JUST HUE THIS HUGE SURF AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WHO HAD GOT N DRAGGED OUT AND ME JUST SEE HIM HE RUNS INTO THE WATER RIGHT HE RUNS IN AND HE GOES AND AND HE WAS REALLY AT RISK HEING TO BE SAVED HIMSELF BUT HE SAVED THEM AND I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT THROUGH THESE DRIVES I DON'T THINK HEN SAY WELL THAT WAS WHO 'S AGGRESSIVE HE HE WANTED TO GO AND DO SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT WAS IMPOSING HIMSELF ON THE WORLD OR HE GOT PLEASURE IND THINKING I'M STRONG ENOUGH TO GO DO THIS A MEAN I THINK WE'RE REALLY DYRATING YOU KNOW WE'RE CONTORTING OURSELVES RIGHT IN ORDER I'VE TO EXPLAIN IT THAT WAY IF WE THINK THERE'S A GOODNESS IN THAT MAN'S HEART LIKE I KNOW THES HE GOODNESS IN THAT MAN'S ART I KNOW HIM RIGHT AND AND AND THAT GOODNESS SEES HIS IN THE MOMENT AND YOU KNOW HE KNOWS THAT MAYBE HE CAN SAVE THEM MAYBE CAN'T I'S NOT SURE BUT MAYBE CAN SO NEXT SING YOU KNOW HE'S IN THE WATER AND I THINK THINGS LIKE THE LOVE AND NURTURING OF OF OTHER PEOPLE OF CHILDREN LOVE A NURTRING OF ANIMALS OF PLANTS I LIKETHERE THINGS INSIDE OF US THA WE CAN'T EXPLAIN WITH THOSE TWO DRIVES AND AND I THINK THEY HAVE LED TO A VERY SOT A DARKER WAY OF JUST CONCEIVING OF HUMANS YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A REASON WHY NOW YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT US IN IN THE MODERN DAY AN AGE WE COMADE HUMANS THROUGH THE LENDS OF BYTHOLOGY RIGHTMEAN AS IT THE'S A VERY VERY THICK BOOK THAT IF IF A PERSON IS ASSESSING ANOTHER PERSON YOU KNOW  IS THINKING ABOUT COOKIN WAT NUMBERS IN THAT BOOK APPLY RIGHT WHICH IS LIKE THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO GO ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HUMANS AND I THINK IF WE JUST THINK THERE ARE THOSE TWO DRIVES WERE NOT DOING JUSTICE TO TO HUMANS RIGHT ONE I THINK IT'S NOT TRUE I THINK IT'S EVIDENT THAT IT'S NOT TRUE AND THEN FOR FRAMING IT IN A WAY THAT'S NOT TRUE WE ARE NOT APPROPRIATELY RESPECTFUL OF HUMANS AND IF WE COME FROM WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE TRUTH THAT THERE IS A GENERATIVE DRIVEN IS A DRIVE FOR THE BEYOND SELF A DRIVE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER WHETHER IT HAS ANYTHING REALLY DIRECTLY TO DO WITH ME OR NOT AND AS WITH THE OTHER DRIVES NOF THERE CAN BE MORE OR LESS IN PEOPLE A COMBINATION OF NATURE AND NURTURE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT GENETICALLY IS IN US A PREDISPOSITION OU KNOBASE UPON THE GENETIC LINEAGE THAT COMES DOWN TO US AND THE RECOMBINATION AND OUR UNIQUE PERSON WITH HE UNIQUES TAT A DRIVES BUT THEY ARE IMPACTED BY THE GENETICS AND THEN THEIR IMPACTED BY LIFE EXPERIENCE AN MORE STRONGLY FORMATIVE LIFE EXPERIENCE RIGHT SO THE YOUNGER THE PERSON THET DI SUITED DEEPER THE IMPACT OF EVENTS OF NURTURING VERSES ABUSE RIGHT ON THE THE ARRAY ON THE RELATIVE WATING OF DRIVES WITHIN PEOPLE BUT ULTIMATELY WE GET TO THESE THREE DRIVES AND HOW THEARE FUNCTIONING IN A PERSON BEING AWAY OF UNDERSTANDING AN A SESSING LIKE HOW HEALTHY OR NOT HEALTHY THE PERSON IS AND THEN WE LOOK BACK TOTHOSE TEN CUPBOARDS RIGHT FOR THE ANSWERS IF WERE FINDING THINGS THAT WE DON'T LIKE THESE JUS DRIVES ARE OUT A BALANCE AND THER AND HER THE PROBLEMS THERE CAUSING SO VERY VERY CONCRETE ISSUES RIGHT OF PROBLEMS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES WE CAN LOOK AND SEE WHERE IS THAT OUT OF BALANCE AND IF IT'S OUT OF BALANCE THERE'S SOMETHING IN THOSE PILLARS THAT ARE NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE WE THEN GO BACK AND LOOK IN ALL THOSE CUPBOARDS FOR LIKE O WHERE DO WE DIG TO FIND THE ANSWER RIGHT WE LEARN THINGS WE WE BRING THINGS MORE INTO BALANCE RIGHT SO SO THE PILLARS ARE IN A HEALTHIER PLACE AND THEN WHAT SITS ON TOP OF IT AS YOU USE OR AT GUYSER WRIGHT THE GUYSER THAT THEN COMES UP AND FLOATS EVERYTHING ON TOP OF IT CAN DO THAT IN A IN A HEALTHY WAY AND DURING EPISODE ONE WE TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN UNDERSTANDING THE SELTH AND OM BUILDING TOWARDS A HEALTH E OR HEALTHIEST VERSION OF SELF WERE ANGENCY AND GRATITUDE ARE THE STATES THAT ARE BEING EXPRESSED AND ONE OF THE THEMES THERE WAS THIS IDEA YOU KNOW PEOPLE PERHAPS WANT TO BE HEALTHY SO THAT THEY LIVE ALONG TIME BUT PRESUMABLY THEY ALSO WANT TO BE HEALTHY SO THAT THEY CAN WALK UP FLIGHTS OF STAIRS PICK UP THE KIDS MOVE OBJECTS NOT GET INJURED PERHAPS EVEN TO SPORT OR I AND OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO BE HEALTHY FOR AESTHETIC REASONS AS WELL AND IF WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT PHYSICAL HEALTH WE COULD DRESS THE MAJOR PILLARS THERE WHICH OR WERE A ITEMS WITHIN THE COVERD LIKE IM YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE WANT A SOME ABILITY TO HAVE ENDURANCE OR STAMINA TO WALK SOME DISTANCE OR MAY BEVEN RUN SOME DISTANCE A SO MUCHON BEFORE WALK UP A FLIGHT OFSEAIRS HAVE SOME STRENGTH SOME DEGREE OF FLECTIBILITY CERTAINLY SOME MOBILITY A MAYBE EVEN DYNAMIC MOBILITY ET CETERA AND IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THOSE OR IMPROVE UPON THOSE THEY COULD LOOK IN THOSE COVERS AND SAY WELL HOW MUCH YOW RUNNING SWIMMING IN ON LONG FORM CARDYOVASCULAR EXERCISE OF MY DOING PER WEEK HOW MANY STEPS OF MY TAKING PER DAY AHOW MANY TIMES A WEEK DO I LIFT OBJECTS THAT ARE A SLIGHTLY HEAVIER THAN IS COMFORTABLE FOR ME TO LIFT ET CETERA THIT IT'S VERY TANGIBLE VERY CONCRETE ON HURE YIOUR MAKING THE THE PSYCHE AN THE AND AN THE SELF AND MENTAL HEALTH A VERY MUCH CONCRETE IN SOME OF THE SAME WAY SAYING THEIR TEN CUPBOARDS THAT ONE CAN LOOK IN AND THESE DRIVES AS YOU REFER TO THEM AS A GENERAIVE DRIVE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND PLEASURE DRIVE IM YOUL PROBABLY TELL US IN A FEW MINUTES A CAN BE EXPRESS TO VARYING DEGREES ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND HOW THAT SHOWS UP AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND I JUST WANT A FRAME THIS AND PEOPLE'S MINDS AS VERY SIMILAR TO ADDRESSING WHETHER NOT OK IF SOMEBODY CAN RUN VERY LONG DISTANCES BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS A YOU KNOW I HAVING AKES AND PAINS OR THEY THEY THEY FEEL WEAK OR THEY ARE WEAK MON THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR THAT THERE OVER EMPHASIZING ONE FORM OF I EXERCISE THE EXPRESSION IS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF ENDURANCE AND STAMMIN AND NOT STRENGTH AM ORE VICE VERSA THE THE POWER LIFTER WHO CAN YOU KNOW LIFT YOU KNOW SEVEN HUDRD FIFTY POUNDS FROM THE FLOOR IN A DED LIFT BUT WALKS UP TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND AS YOU KNOW BELLY BREATHING AND HAS TO STOP AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS A YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S OBVIOUS IN THE PHYSICAL REALM IT'S SLIGHTLY A MORE CRYPTIC OR MORE CRYPTIC IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REALM BUT HERE IT'S BECOMING CONCRETE FOR US SO I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY INTERESTING AND VERY IRONIC RIGHT S O THE FIELD THAT I'M IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY HAS HISTORICALLY WANTED TO BE SORT OF PART OF THE REST OF MEDICINE OR LIKE THE REST OF MEDICINE AND AND WHAT I BELIEVE IT'S ENDED UP DOING IS GLORIFYING ATTAXONOMY IGHT GLORIFYING A CATEGORY A MECHANISM OF UNDERSTANDING HUMAN BEINGS SO IN THE WAY THAT THAT IF OK IF I'M A A PRACTICING GENERAL MEDICINE AND YOU COME IN IN YOUR CONGESTED AND AND I DETERMINE LIKE OH YOU HAVE YOU HAVE BACTERIAL SINUCIDE IS RIGHT SO SO NOW I I'VE MADE A DIAGNOSIS AND NOW TH I I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT RI SO SO THE OCAM GAN TO PRESCRIBE IN ANABIOTIC NOW THE THOUGHT COMES IN OF LIKE WHAT ANTIBIOTIC RIGHT BUT THE IDENTIFY SIN USITE IS NAGINAT AND ANTIBOTIC IS I CANAHAL MEDICINE WORKS RIGHT SO THE THOUGHT WAS PSYCHIETRY IS CANACATEGORIZE EVERYTHING RIGHT SO WE'D SAIL AVE LISTENED TO YOU LIKE A I KNOW YOUR NUMBER OR YOUR NUMBERS RIGHT AND THEND ONCE I'VE GIVEN YOU THE NUMBERS NOW I KNOW WHAT TO DO I PRESCRIBE THIS MEDICINE THAT MEDICINE THESE MANY SESSIONS OF A CERTAIN KIND OF PSYCHOTHERAPY AND LIKE THAT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT IT DOESN'T WORK IN MENTAL HEALTH IT MAY EMASES IT'S NOT I NEVER WORKS BUT IF YOVEN O TRY AND UNDERSTAND PEOPLE LIKE IT'S DIFFERENT A PROBLEM OF SELF LIKE IF I HAVE A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ONE AREA OF LIFE AND NOT IN OTHERS RIGHT THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IT IS NOT LIKE BACTERIAL PSINU SECTI WHERE THEN YOU KNOW O K ARROW GOES TO PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTIC AND I THINK WHAT IS IRONIC IS THAT THIS ROUT OF APPROCH RIHT ACTUALLY DOES BRING PSYCHIITR MENTAL HEALTH INTO LINE WITH THE REST OFH MEDICINE T WHICH IS WHY YOU CAN MAKE THAT PARALLEL AND YOU ON'T FITS WELL RIGHT WHEN YOUARE MAKING THE PARALLEL TO PHYSICAL HEALTH AND TO I WANT TO BE HEALTHY O'LL CA WHAT OS THE COMPONENTS OF THAT WHAT AM I DOING TO ACHIEVE THAT IF SOMETHING'S NOT THE WAY I WANT LET ME GO BACK AND LOOK AT THOSE COMPONENTS IT MAY BE BECAUSE IT'S MORE TANGIBLE A SORT OF IT ISN'T YO EASIER TO COMPREHEND DRI MUSICS MORE IT'S MORE CONCRETE BUT BUT I DON'T INNOCENSE SEE IT IS CRYPTIC JUST LESS OBVIOUS RIG BUT IF WE GO AND WE LOOK AT IT AND WE SAY ALL EK THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE RIGHT AND AND IT INNOCENSE IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT MAKES SENSE RIGHT IF THERE'S A MECHANISM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT APPLIES TO LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE MORE CONCRETE WHY WHAT A SIMILAR KIND OF MECHANISM LIKE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMPONENTS ARE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BUILT ON TOP OF THEM LIKE THIS I BELIEVE IS HOU PSYCHIETRYTE ACTUUL FITS WITH THE REST OF MEDICINE NOT BY GLORIFYING A TAXONOMY BUT BY COMING THROUGH THE LENDS OF UNDERSTANDING I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND I I THINK THAT WHAT SO REASSURING IS THAT BOTH IN TERMS OF CREATING PHYSICAL HEALTH ACROSS THE VARIOUS DOMAINS OF YOU KNOW HEART HEALTH LONG HEALTH ENDURANC STRENGTH ET CETERA COGNATIVE HEALTH AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH IS VERBS YOU NOIT COMES BACK TO ACTION ITEMS THAT WE EACH AND ALL SHOULD ENGAGE IN IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT THE STATES TAND YOU KNOW WAYS OF BEING THAT WE ALL WANT TO BE RIGHT WE WANT TO FEEL HEALTHY LOOK HEALTHY IT YU KNOW ET CETERA WE WANT TO ON BE HAPPY ID I KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO BE HAPPY IMIN CERTAINLES THATER PEOPLE WO GIVE UP BHAT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT TO DAY AND EN ROUTS OUT OF THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ALL ABOUT LOOKING IN THOSE BINS ASKING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND THEN MOVING FORWARD IN SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO GET TO THE PLACE OF EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENCY GRATITUDE PECE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT ET CETERA 'M AS OPPOSED TO IM SIMPLY USING WORDS AND UNDERSTANDING TO ARRIVE AT INSIGHT AND THEN STOPPING THERE AND EXPECTING EVERYTHING TO CHANGE AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY THERAPEAN PSYCHIETRY AND M AND AS YOU MENTION PSYCHATRI HAS ITS OWN IM I SHADOWS IF YOU WILL WITHIN IT WHERE THE THE USE OF OF DRUGS WHICH CERTAI CERTAINLY CAN BE VERY USEFUL EVEN LIFE SAVING OFTENTIMES IS IS SEEN AS A I'M A FIX ALL THAT IM SOMEHOW COULD REORDER EVERYTHING WITHIN THE COVERDS AND AND MAKE THE RECIPE JUST RIGHT WHEN IN FACT SWEL TALK ABOUT TO DAY THAT THAT IS I'M GENERALLY NOT THE BEST ROUTE BUT AGAIN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT DRUGS CAN BE VERY POWERFUL TOOLS SAY A RULE YE I BISE POINT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT ROLS APPROPRIATE FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHERE WE OFTEN GO ASTRAY I' LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS AG ONE AG ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBOTIC DRINK THAT MEETS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS I STARTED TAKING A G ONE WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING AG ONE AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE A G ONE ONCE OR GENERALLY TWICE PER DAY IS THAT IT'S THE EASIEST WAY FOR ME TO INSURE THAT I'M GETTING ALL OF THE VITAMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBRE THAT I NEED IN MY DIET NOW OF COURSE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO GET PROPER NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS BUT MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FIND IT HARD TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES EACH DAY AND ESPECIALLY TO GET ENOUGH PREBIOTICS AND PROBIOTICS TO ENSURE GOT HEALTH AS YOU MAY KNOW YOUR GOT CONTAINS TRILLIANS OF LITTLE MICROBIODA THE SO CALLED GOT MICROBIOM WHICH ESTABLISHES CRITICAL CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANS OF YOUR BODY TO ENHANCE BRAIN HEALTH AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER ASPECTS THAT RELATE TO MENTAL AND PHYSICAL H ALTH ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET IS IF YOU WERE TO TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHIT SUPPLEMENT WOULD THAT BE AND MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS  G ONE BECAUSE BY TAKING  G ONE I'M ABLE TO ENSURE THAT I'M GETTING ALL OF THE VITEMENS MINERALS AND PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED TO ENHANCE MY MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY  G ONE GO TO DRINK  G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER HEY'L GIVE YOU FIVE FRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMAN D THREE K TO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK  G ONE DOT ALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER SO S WE MOVE FORWARD HERE IND DEFINING AND AND HELPING PEOPLE GAIN A FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD AGENCY OVER THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH AND AND SELF UNDERSTANDING AND DEFINING FOR THEM WHAT WHAT ACTION I DEMS TO TAKE I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE HE THINGS THAT I ABSORVE IN THE WORLD AND HERE A LOT ABOUT IN PARTICULAR FROM THE AUDIENCE OF THIS PODCAST OH UM IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME THAT PEOPLE VARY IN TERMS OF THEIR LEVEL OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVE PLEASURE DRIVE AND PRESUMALY GENERATIVE DRIVE AS WELL UM ONE COMMON QUESTION IS HOW DO I BECOME MORE MOTIVATED IGHT YOU KNOW IM AND OF COURSE THAT OPENS UP A BUNCH OF OTHER QUESTIONS LIKE OUR PEOPLE AFRAID OF FAILURE AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE NOT MOTIVATED PEOPLE AFRAID OF SUCCESS  WHE THEY'RE NOT MOTIVATED IS THERE SOME UNDERLYING CHILD O TRAMA OR UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS A THAT'S DRIVING THAT FEAR IM AND SO ON BUT IF WE WERE TO TAKE THE PSYCHITROS PERSPECTIVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE IF SOME ONE COMES TUDENCES YOU KNOW I OUND I JUST DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE TRYING IT'S A UNO SCHOOLS HARD  A SCHOOL LOANS ARE IU KNO ARE EXCESSIVE WHICH IS TRUE BY THE WAY AH YOU KNOW'S NOT HIAM CLEAR THAT WITH A DEGREE I CAN DO MUCH YOU KNOW OR I'D A SERIES OF FAILURES AND IN TE WORK DOMAIN OR IN THE RELATIONSHIP DOMAIN AND AND THEY'RE JUST FEELING WEIG DOWN AS IF IT'S NOT WORTH TRYING OM YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU IN TERMS OF WHERE TO LOOK AND AND WHAT OESTHAT TELL YOU IN TERMS OF THEIR DRIVES AND DO WE CONCLUDE SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR INNATE LEVEL OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVE ON WERE THEIRE PLEASURE DRIVER THEI'RE GENERATIVE DRIVE MI THINK THEREARE MANY SUCH PEOPLE OUT THERE AND THEN WE'LL CONSIDER SOME OTHER I'M CAN A PHOENATIPIC EXAMPLES THOSE A GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE SOANY GOOD CLINATION IT COULD COULD HEAR THAT STORY AND THEN AND HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT IT T THAT THAT COULDEN WOULD HOPEFULLY BE HELPFUL  WITHOUT NECESSARILY REFERRING TO DRIVES I SO SO I THINK YOU CAN ANCER ANY SET OF ASSASSENS ANY EVALUATION ANY ATTEMPT AT UNDERSTANDING TO DRIVES BUT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT ASK THAT PERSON MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING HOW THEY SPEND THEIR TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT SOME ONE WHO'S NOT ENGETTING ENJOYMENT OR GRATIFICATION OUT OF ANYTHING RIGHT AND AND THAT THEN BECOMES OF INTEREST TO ME I IS IS THERE IS THERE SOMETHING THIS PERSON DOES ENJOY REYR SOMETHING THEY'D RATHER BE DOING LIKE DID THEY DID THEY GO TO COLLEGE AND TAKE ON A BUNCH OF LONS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS BETTER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT NOW THEY ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO DO RIGHT OR THAT OPPORTUNITY ISN'T THERE ANOTHER FRUSTRATE LIKE WHAT IS INSIDE THIS PERSON THAT MIGHT SEEM DIFFERENT THAN THAT AND AND AGAIN THE ANSWERS COULD BE COMPLICATED IT COULD BE MAYBE THAT PERSON ENJOYS WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT THE COST OF LIVING WHERE THEY ARE IS SO HIGH THAT THEY STILL FEEL MISERABLE THERE'S A SENSE OF PRIVATION AND THEN THAT GETS BACK MAP TO LIKE I DON'T NOT GET ANY PLEASURE OUT OF ANYTHING I SO THE ANSWER COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS YOU STRATEGIZED WITH HA PERSON OF YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DOES A PERSON LIKE THAT MOVE YOU ARE MOVE TO A DIFFERENT AREA SO SO H THERE'S SO MANY WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS IN SO MANY WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING THIS BUT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SOME ONE TO ME WHO WHO IT IS C AT REALLY COMPLAINING THAT NOTHING IS FEELING GOOD RIGHT NOTHING'S PROVIDING A SENSE OF AOF ENJOYMENT OR PLEASURE RIGHT SO I WOULD PROBABLY BE INTERESTED IN THAT FIRST AND THINK MAYBE THETHE PLEASURE DRIVE IS HIGHER THAN WHAT'S BEING FULFILLED RIGT MAYBE THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS IS LOW AND THAT'S AN ISSUE IN N OF ITSELF ALWE STOOD A LEARN THOSE THINGS RIGHT MAYBE THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS LOW AND THAT PERSON JUST PUT A LITTLE MORE ENERGY INTO IT RIGHT LIKE THEY COULD BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE RIGHT SO YOU TRY AND TO HOP THE PERSON UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE CHANGE AND AGAIN THAT UNDERSTANDING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANCHORED TO TO THE DRIVES BUT I DO BELIEVE THE DRIVES ARE AT THE ROOT OF ALL UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE IF YU SIT WITH THAT PERSON AND YOU TALK TO THAT PERSON THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS OUT OF BALANCE RI EITHER IN THETHE ACTUAL ARRAY OF THE DRIVES OR IN HOW THERE BEING BEING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE AGAIN FEEL A HIGH PLEASURE DRIVE FOR EXAMPLE AND IT'S NOT GRATIFIED RIGHT LIKE THAT REPRESENTS A PROBLEM IKNOW WHAT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN EXPERIENCE SOME PLEASURE OR CAN KEEP BUSY SAY FOR INSTANCE ON SOCIAL MEDEAR PLAING VIDIO GAMES AND I SHOULD ALSO SAY PERHAPS IT'S BRINGING THEM TO A PLACE OF PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT BUT IN SOME SENSE IT'S NOT REALLY GENERATIVE RIGHT YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO CAST JUDGMENT AND SAY THAT VIDIO GAMES AND SOCIAL MEDER ARE ALL WASTE OF TIME I MEAN I'M ON SOCIAL MEDIA TRYING TO PROVIDE VALUE TO PEOPLE AND LEARNINGS AND A MAN I DRIVE VALUE IN LEARNINGS FROM OTHER ACCOUNTS AS WELL BUT YOU THERE ARE THESE A MILESTONES IF YOU WILL IN LIFE I MEAN NOT THAT EVERYONE HAS TO YOU KNOW GO TO COLLEGE AND AN GET MARRIED A FAMILYMEN THERE ALLOWD DIFFERENT PATHS THROUGH LIFE THAT I WOULD CONSIDER SUCCESSFUL BUT IN SOME SENSE WE YOU KNOW THERE ARE MILESTONES LIKE WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD THERE'S AS PHENOMENO NOWADAYS OF A LOT OF A YOUNG PEOPLE SO CALED FAILURE TO LAUNCH MI THAT THEY'RE NOT LEAVING HOME OR THEY'RE NT FINDING A VOCATION AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT FEELING AS IF THEY'RE GOOD ANYTHING I O WHERE THEY HAVE THE SENSE THAT UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PYOU KNOW LIKE TOP ONE PERSENT IN SOMETHING IT'S NOT WORTH TRYING BUT THEY CAN STILL FIND A YOU KNOW WHAT MOST PEOPLE DESCRIBE AS PLEASURES LIKE THEY MIGHT HEY ENJOY FOOD I MAYBE LITTLE TOO MUCH A THEY ENJOY A I'LL CALL MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH THEY ENJOY SO CHREMEDIA OR VIYOU GAMES MAYBE LITTLE TOO MUCH I SAY A LITTLE TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT IT'S PROVIDING MORE OR LESS A AI SINK OR OR A RESERVOIR FOR THEIR AGGRESSIVE AND PLEASURE DRIVES THAT'S NOT MOVING THEM FORWARD IN THAT THE STANDARD MILESTONES OF LIVE I I I HEAR ABOUT THAT A LOT I I SEE THAT OR LOT  YOU KNOW IT SO IT'S AS SLIGHTLY MORE I'M COMPLEX A FINATYPE THAN DESCRIBE IONG FOR IS JUST SIMPLY THE AMOTIVATED OR NON MOTIVATED PERSON BUT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES ONE YET WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OF THAT AOF THE FIANTYPE IE JUST DESCRIBED  BECAUSE WERE UNIQUE RIT EACH PERSON IS UNIQUE OR THE WEEFIT CATEGORIES RIT SO THEIR CATEGORIES A PERSON THERE COULD FIT THAT COULD BE DIFFERENT FOR WHAT I'M SAYING  BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE TO SAT ON BALANCE RIG WHAT'S WHAT IS MOST PROMINENT I I THINK WHAT IS MOST PROMINENT IN THAT SITUATION IS THERE'S SOMETHING OUT OF BALANCE IN THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND WHAT O YOU SEE A LOT OF TIMES IS THE PERSON IS A GENERATIVE DRIVE IN THE THAT'S HIGHER THAN THEIR ABILITY TO TO REALIZE THAT DRIVE THE GENERATVE DRIVE THEN IS FRUSTRATED SO I GVE AN EXAMPLE IN O REAL TRUE STORY OF A PERSON WHO WORKED VERY VERY HARD GONE TO SCHOOL FOR A LONG TIME AND IT ACHIEVED A VERY HIGH PAING JOB AND THAT WAS THE GOALD RIGT IS A PRESTIDIOUS JOB IS A HIGH PANG JOB AND THE PERSON FOR A WHILE WAT WAS DOING QUITE WELL ADDED AND ITO THINGS WHET O RELATIVELY RAPIDLY AND N EGATIVE DIRECTIONS MAY BE FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE PERSONS DOING OQET THEN THE PERSON BECOMES VERY NEGLIGENT OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT WHEN THEY'RE NOT AT THE JOB SO THEN OTHER THE HOUSEIS OF MASS THINGS OR DIRTY THE PERSON IS WASTING TIME WITH THINGS SO THIS IS A PERSON WHO ENJOYS IT WASN'T EXACTLY VIDIOGAME TER LAS  ILET'S SAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT WELL ENJOYS THEM TO A CERTAIN DEGREE AND CAN REALLY GAIN PLEASURE AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE TIME SPENT RIGHT BESIDE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME RIGHT NOW WHAT WAS PLEASURABLE SAAS BECOMING A DISTRACTION MECHANISM RIGHT AND THAN WHAT THAT TRANSITION TO WAS OVERUSE OF ALCOHOL RGHT SO NOW YOU HAVE EITHER SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY DESTRUCTIVE AND WAS NEGATIVE TO JOB PERFORMANCE RIGHT TOWARDS THE PERSON THIS WASN'T A PERSON WHO AS DRINKING A LOT BEFORE AND THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS MISERABLE WHEN THEY WERE DRINKING OR THEY WERE SERT OF WASTING THEIR TIME RIGHT AND WERE AWARE OF ALL THIS WELL IT WAS A VERY CLEAR PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT PERSON HAD NO INTEREST IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING NONE WHATSOEVER IT FELT LIKE THE MAJORITY OF WAKING HOURS WERE SPENT IN AN AUTOMATON LIKE WAY BUT BEING AWAKE AND AWARE OF THE TEDIUM OF IT THE FROSTRATION OF IT AN NATIONAL SIDE SO THAT THEY  SUCH AS HAD VERY LITTLE A INTRINSIC CURIOSITY YOR DESIRE TO DO THE JOB THAT THEY WERE SEXIICAGLY DOING RIGHT WHICH COMES OUT ONLY AFTER EXPLORATION BECAUSE IT SEEMS  WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS PERSON AN TERSONASIC A JOB AND THER LIFE WAS GOING REALLY REALLY WELL AND AND THEY'RE DOING WELL FINANCIALLY AND YOU KNOW IS THIS PERSON TRYING TO NOW YOU KNOW OVERLY INDULGE THEMSELVES WHIELIT AS OUT WHY THEY'R DRINKING WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT AND WHAT YOUFEELS THAT THIS PERSON OF STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE AND WAS IT MET ONE LITTLE BIT BY WHAT HE WAS DOING WHICH WAS CREATING SUCH FRUSTRATION INSIDE THAT THE PERSON WAS EITHER TAKING HIMSELF ON LINE OR DOING SOMETHING THAT WAS PUNITIVE AND SELF INJURIOUS AND LIKE THIS IS A REALS URY THE THE PERSON EXCHANGE THAT JOB FOR A JOB THAT PAID A TENTH OF WHAT THE JOB THEY HAD PAID AND THE CHANGE IN THE PERSON'S LIFE WAS AMAZING LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW THE SKY COULD SMILE IGHT HE BECAME HAPPY HE LOVED WHAT HE WAS DOING HE SOLD A LARGER HOUSE BOUGHT A SMALLER HOUSE IT BEAUTIFULLY LIKE HE WAS HAPPY IGHT THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDED TO BE HAPPY BECAUSE THEN THE GENERATIVE DRIVING HIM HE LOVED WHAT HE WAS DOING AT GETS ENACTED IT GETS EXPRESS AND THEN OTHER OTHER THINGS CAN COME THAN INTO LINE RIGHT HE'S NOT BEING OVER AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS HIMSELF AND DRINKING TOO MUCH YOU KNOW BECAUSE HES SANG OR TO HELP WITH YOU TO THE WORLD AROUND HIM AND TO HIMSELF RIGHT HE'S NOT TAKING SOMETHING THAT SERVES A PURPOSE IN HIS LIFE LIKE AGAIN IF THE EXAMPLE HAD BEEN VIDIO GAMES IT WOULD BE LIKE A GREAT ENJOY DOING THAT EX AMOUNT OF TIME AND LITE GO DO THAT AND GET GRATIFICATION FROM IT AS OPPOSED TO THEN OVER RELYING ON IT AND THEN IT'S NOT PROVIDING GRATIFICATION BECOMES A DISTRACTION SO THOSE THINGS CAME BACK INTO BALANCE IN HIS LIFE BUT THERE HAD TO BE THE UNDERSTANDING AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THAT IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GENERATIVE DRIVE IN THEM THAT THEY FEEL IS FRUSTRATED BY A WORLD AROUND THEM THAT ISN'T CO OPERATING NOW DO I THINK WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IN CHANGE THAT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT PLACE YES BUT IT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT FIRST RIGHT CAUSE WHEN IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT ITS JUST THAT A LOT OF THE TIME RIGHT SO IT HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IS IT IN THAT PERSON AND THEN HOW DO YOU GO BACK TO THOSE PILLARS AND LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON THAT THE PERSON IS IN THAT PLACE BECAUSE THE WORLD CAN BRING US A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES RIGHT AND THAT PERSON WHO NOW IS SADDLED WITH A LOT MORE LOANS THEN THEY EXPECT LIK I'VE TREMENDOUS COMPASSION FOR THAT SYMPATHY FOR THAT LIK THAT'S REAL RIGHT SO PEOPLE CAN BE UP AGAINST A LOT OF THINGS AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THEM RIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT LIFE CAN'T BE OKEY  IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT BUT THE PERSON HAS TO FEEL THAT THERE'S SOME WAY TEF TO UNDERSTAND ENOUGH ABOUT THEMSELVES IDOCATE THIS IS WHA T THIS IS AND I CANT SEE WHAT THIS IS AND WHY AND HOW I'M HERE AND FROM THERE I CAN START TO PLOT AROL TO SOMETHING THAT IS BETTER BECAUSE YES WE HAVE OUR DIFFICULTIES AND WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF THEM I BUT ISN FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US IS NOT LIKE THEIR NOT SURMOUNTABLE WE HAVE TO JUST UNDERSTAND THEM AND LET'S SAY F THAT PERSON GOES AND SO I'M GONG TO GET SOME HELP AND THEY GO AND SOME ONE TOS O KER YOU YOU GET TEN SESSIONS OF COGNA TO BEHAVEROLFARA BEING TRYING LIKE HALGIN THAT PERSINE THINK DIFFERENTLY THEN THEY'LL FEEL DIFFERENTLY LOOK COGNI TO BEHAVRI FHERAPY HAS ITS PLACE IGHT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THAT RIGHTLY THAT PERSON EES UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT THEMSELVES NOT REDIRECT THEIR THOUGHTS TO BETTER PLACE RIGHT SO IF THE PERSINE GETS A REFLEX BECAUSE THAT REFLEXT WORKS WELL FOR THE SYSTEM RIGHT IT REFLEXT WORKS WELL FOR THIS SYSTEM THAT'S TREATING THAT PERSON FOR THE MEDICAL SYSTEM TE INSURANCE SYSTEM THAT PERSON ISNI'T HELPED ONE BIT I AND MAY BE A MEDICINE CAN HELP RIGHT MAYBE A MEDICINE HELP SUGGEST TAKE DOWN THE ANXIETY IN THE TENSION IN THE PERSON AND THE PERSON CAN SOT A THINK MORE ABOUT IT AND AND TRULY MEDICINE DID HELP THIS PERSON BECAUSE THE IDEA OF LEAVING THE JOB AN LEAVING THE PRESTIGE AND LEAVING THE MONEY IS THAT OCATED DO I COULD GENERATE A LOT OF ANXIETY AND IT HELP THE KIND OF BRING THE TEMPERATURE DOWN A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SO THAT HE COULD THINK ABOUT IT ENGAGE IN THERA BE ULTIMATELY NAVIGATE TO WHRE HE WANTED TO BE THEN WE GET BACK AWAY FROM THE MEDICINE SO LIKE MEDICINE HAS A ROLL BUT IT IF HE JUST GOT MEDICINE I MEAN WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITY WHAT THE ODS OF THAT HELPING  ZERO RIGHT IS IS IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE ANSWERS UNLESS SOMEHOW THE PERSON FEELS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND FIGURES IT OUT ON THEIR OWN IT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS RIGHTS O MEDICINE HAS ITS PLACE BUT A KIND OF THERAPY THAT RECOGNIZES TE LIMITATIONS OF MEDICINE IN MOST SITUATIONS AND IS DESIGND TO REALLY HELP THE PERSON UNDERSTANDLIKE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED  THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE IS A SPECTACULAR ONE BECAUSE SYOU MENTION MEDICATION HAD ITS PLACE PERHAPS EVEN REDIRECTION OF THOUGHT IN SOME SINES HADENS PLACE BECAUSE AS I RECALL IT UNDER THE THE PILLAR OF FUNCTION OF SELF IIN ONE OF THE THE THE KEY F ITEMS A ISSALIENCE YOU KNOW WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY WHAT OUR INTERNAL NARRATIVES ARE BUT A IN STAYING WITH TE EXAMPLE OF THIS INDIVIDUAL AGAIN AS A AS A PHENATYPIC A EXAMPLE FOR EVERYBODY TO TO LEARN SOMETHING FROM THE ASKING OF BETTER QUESTIONS ABOUT ONESELF AS REALLY WHAT LEADS TO THE UNDERSTANDING SO THAT LIKE BETTER FORMS OF INQUIRY RIKE THE TO ME THE THESE ARE THE THESE BETTER FORMS OF INQUIRY A BTTER QUESTIONS ARE REALLY THE A CARTY OF OSCULAR EXERCISE THE STRENGTH TRAINING THE FLEXIBILITY TRAINING THE MOBILITY TRAINING CORDINATION TRAINING OF PHYSICAL HEALTH JUST TRANSLATE TO TO MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT SO IT'S SO INTERESTING RIPIEG AS THINK ABOUT IT IN THE EXAMPLE I GAVE BOTH THE THE THERIPE PART FROM THROUGH THE SYSTEM RIGHT THAT THE SB T HAS A PLACE RIGHT AND THE MEDICINE PART ALSO HAW TO PLACE SO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS HAVE THE ROLE BUT IF WE BUILD THE WHOLE STORY A LIKE THIS IS WHAT THIS ISINESS IS HIGHER CAN BE HELPED AROUND THOSE THINGS WE DON'T HELP THAT PERSON AT ALL IN FACT WE ULTIMATELY IF YOU TAKE ON BALANCE YOU TAKE ALL COMERS WE END OF DOING HARM BUT IN SOME WAYS IFVI WE STAY WITH THE A THE ANALOGY OF PHYSICAL EALTHOU BE LIKE THE PERSON WHO WANTS TO GET IN SHAPE AND THAN THEY GET AA M NOT PICKING ON PELATON A AS A BRAND BUT YOUS A STATIONARY BIKE AND THEY THEY PEDDLE EVERY MORNING AND THEY LOSE WEIGHT THEIR BLOODPRESSURE GOES DOWN THEY'RE DOING BETTER BUT THEN AT SOME POINT IF WE WE KNOW FOR WITH CERTAINTY THAT IF YOU JUST DO THE SAME FORM OF EXERCISE OVER AND OVER AGAIN LIY SOONER OR LATER YOU GAN TO GET OVER USE INJURIES SO THATS LIKE THE LOWER BACK PIECE AND ANOTHER PIECE AND ANU BECOME OUT OF BALANCE I THERE'S JUST BUT YOU KNOW I GUESS THIS IS STEALING FROM THE LANC'S ARMSTRONG BOOK A BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE VERY DEVEN  YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE IT'S ABOUT THE ELEVATION OF HEARTWRIGHT IT'S ABOUT THE A WHATEVER OTHER HEALTHY ACTIVITIES GO ALONG WITH EXERCISING FOR SING IN THE MORNING AND THE ALL THE THINGS THA YOU'RE NOT DOING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ERCISING IN THE MORNING UM SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE THESE A BETTER LINES OF INQUIRY IS THE PATH TO A BETTER MENTAL HEALTH A BETTER LIFE A THAT SIT UNDER THESE PILLARS OF STRUCTURE ORSELF FUNCTION ORSELF ARE REALLY THE KEY IN THIS EXAMPLE RIGHT THE PARALLEL THAT YOU MADE IS EVEN MORE DRAMATIC  IT WOULDN'T BE H A THE STATIONARY BAG RIGHT BECAUSE THE STATIONARY BIKE IS ACHIEVING A LOT OF TENDS RIGHT IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE TELLING THE PERSON YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD WALK MORE BRISKLY WHEN YOU'RE GOING UPSTAIRS RILING THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE CHANGE RIGHT SO THE IDEA THAT SOME S B T SOME MEDICINE MAKE SENSE IT'S MORE LIKE THAT RIGHT IS NOT THAT WALKING WHERE BRISKLY UP THE STAIRS ISN'T A GOOD THING IT'S THAT WWE CAN'T BUILD THE STORY AROUND YOUR WHOLE HEALTH IS GOING TO CHANGE BASE UPON THAT AAND THEN THAT'S THIT'S A PROBLEM THAN IF THE PERSON THINKS JUST WALK MORE BRISKLY UP THE STAIRS AND YOU'LL BE HEALTHIER BECAUSE WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK NOW THEY'VE FAILED RIGHT AND THIS GETS USE A LOT IN MENTAL THAT PERSON FAILED THE STHERE BE FAILED THAT MEDICINE RIGHT AND AND GETS SO ALSO IRONIC BECAUSE THAT'S OFTEN WHAT THE PERSON INTERNALISES WELL THEY FAILED BECAUSE WE SET THEM UP ONE HUNDRED PER CENT FOR FAILURE RIGHT BECAUSE WE TOOK THINGS THAT HAVE THEIR ROLE AT LEAST POTENTIALLY HAVE THE ROLE AND WE BUILD THE WHOLE STORY AROUND THEM BECAUSE THAT STORY IS CONVENIENT FOR THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROVIDING THE CARE IFS PIT'S CONVENIENT FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IS CONVENIENT FOR THE INSURES SE B TEEP PACKAGES VERY NICELY AND YOU COULD SEE HOW IF YOU START CHANGING THOUGHTS AND HOW THEY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE EVEN YOU CAN GET SOME MOVEMENT ON THE SURFACE EVEN IF THERE'S NO MOVEMENT UNDERNEATH RIGHT AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING S B T IS BAD BUT TO SEE IT AS THE WHOLE ANSWER GUARANTEE'S FAILURE IN SO MANY SITUATIONS SAME THING WITH THE MEDICINE IF YOU BUILD THE WHOLE STORY JUST CAUSE IT'S CONVENIENT AND AND BY ENLARGE MEDICINES ARE CHEAPER THAN PEOPLE RIGHT SO SO YOU CAN PRESCRIBE MEDICINES VERY REFLECTIVELY PSYCHATEROUS WITH FIFTEEN MINUTES WITH TA PATIENT THAT THEY CAN'T THEN SEE BACK FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS LIKE HOW DOES THAT GO WELL THE ANSWER IS IT ONLY GOES WELL THE WAY OF BROKEN CLOCK IS RIHT A COUPLE OF TIMES YOU KNOW TWICE IT TWICE A DAY RIGHT I MEAN SOM LOOK SOMETIMES IT GOES WELL WHERE JUST SOMEHOW IT WORKS OUT IN THE THAT PERSON CAN DO A LITTLEBIT OF THERAPEIN FIFTEEN MINUTES AND CHOOSE THE RIGHT MEDICINES BUT BY ENLARGE WE DO THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THEYR CONVENIENT FOR THE SYSTEMS EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHY HE PEOPLE DON'T GET BETTER LIKHT LIKE WE THINK THEY WOULD THAT'S WHY THEY STAY IN SYSTEM THAT'S WHY THEY COME IN AND OUT OF EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO STOP THE DRUGS THAT END UP IN ONLY BEING STOP IT WHEN THE PERSON DIES LIKE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND WE DON'T STOP IT BECAUSE WE'RE COMING FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT IS SO LIMITD THAT'S NOT SAYING LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK CAN WE REALLY LIKE HELP SOME ONE CAN WE REALLY HELP THAT PERSON UNDERSTAND CAN WE HELP THAT PERSON MAKE CHANGE WHICH ULTIMATELY WOULD BE OF COURSE SO MUCH BETTER FOR THE PERSON AND SO MUCH BETTER FOR SOCIETY BUT IS ALSO BETTER IF WE JUST LOOK AT BOTTOM LINE DOLLARS AN SENSE IGHT BECAUSE THE SHORT TERM VIEW OF IT IS CHEAPER TO DAY TO AVE A PSYCHATRIS AT A FIFTEEN MENUTE APPOINTMENT REFLECTIVELY PRESCRIBE AN MEDICINE THAT IS CHEAPER TO DAY IS THAT CHEAPER A CROSS TIME WHEN THAT PERSON IS UTILIZING MORE RESOURCES OF THEIR IN AND OUT OF EMERGENCY ROOMS IT'S SO SHORT SIGHTED WITH WHICH FITS WITH MANY WAYS AND HOWR SOCIETY WORKS RIGHT THAT WE WANT GRATIFICATION WE WANT GRATIFICATION RAPIDLY THAT'S WHY A PERSON WOULD ACCEPT AT THEIR PROBLEMS COULD BE CHANGED BY MEDICINE BI BEK OND A CONDITION THAT WAY WELL  OF COURSE THER'S THE THE COST WE DON'T SEE WHICH IS THAT PERSON DOESN'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR GENERATIVE DRIVE AND SO THE AND THE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS INCALCULABLE RIGHT YES AND IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND WE LOOK AT THAT I THINK THAT WHAT WE WILL SEE IS THAT WE HAVE IT'S NOT QUITE THAT PAINTED OURSELVES INTO A CORNER BUST LIKE YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT IF IS A BEAUTIFUL TAPESTRY THAT'S THE SIZE OF THE WALL I THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT ONLY STANDING BACK FROM IT RIMINESS GOES BACK YOU KNOW I THINK ITCOUPLE THOUSAND YEARS TIT THIS IS SUIT OF THOUGHT AN IDEA BUT IF YOU COME UP TOO CLOSE TO IT AND YOU KEEP CAN'T SEE WHAT IT MEANS ANY MORE AND WE'RE UP SO CLOSE TO IT THAT WE'RE THINKING WELL H COULD HOW COULD ONE PERAMETER CHANGE AND YOU KNOW CAN CAN THIS PERSON GET AT FIFTEEN MINUTE VISIT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER RABIT THIS MEDICINE INSTEAD OF THAT AND THAN SLIKE OUR NOSES ARE RIGHT UP AGAINST THE TAPESTRY AND WE DON'T SEE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT BY INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE A LOT OF THE TIME AND WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT BY SOCIETY WHICH THEN IF YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT BY US IS ANY ONE OF US COULD BE IN THAT POSITION AND MANY OF US HAVE BEEN IN THAT POSITION BEING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS AND REALLY NEEDING HELP AND NEEDING TO UNDERSTAND SO ANY OF US CAN BE THERE SO IF WE'RE FAILING A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE AND WE'RE FAILING THE SOCIETY IT IS THE MATTER WHO WE ARE LISTENING TO THIS LIKE ULTIMATELY WE'RE FAILING OURSELVES I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR ATE SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY I'E SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT THE FACT THAT GETTING A QUALLITY NIGHT'S SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING WELL EVERYTHING GOES BETTER AND WHEN WE ARE NOT SLEEPING WELL OR ENOUGH EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE GETS FAR WORSE VERY QUICKLY ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT'S SLEEP AS TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOU NEED YOUR COOR BODY TEMPERATURE TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED YOU NEED YOUR COOR BODY TEMPERATURE TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES THAT ALL BECOMES VERY EASY WHEN USING AND ATE SLEEP MATTRESS COVER BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO PROGRAMM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AT THE BEGINNING M IT'LL END TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP I STARTED SLEEPING ON AN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER OVER TWO YEARS AGO AND IT IMMEDIATELY AND PERSISTENTLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND DEPTH OF MY SLEEP AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I WAKE UP FEELING FAR MORE REFRESHED I HAVE ENHANCED MOOD FOCUSS AN ALERTNESS THROUGHOUT THE DAY IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO SAVE UP TO A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U SSA CANADA U K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S THEREFORE TALK ABOUT WHAT DOES WORK YU AND AGAIN PLACING ON THE SHELF THE THE FACT THAT MEDICATIONS CAN HELP AND SE B T COGNO BEHAVIOUR  THERE WE CAN'T HELP BUT IT' THEY ARE JUST BUT TO COMPONENTS OF A MUCH LARGER PICTURE THE MAP THAT WE DESCRIBE BRIEFLY AT THE BEGINNING OF TO DAY'S EPISODE AND THAT IS BY THE WAY AVAILABLE AS A DONLOTABLE P D F IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS IF PEOPLE ON TO LOOK AT IT VISUALLY AND THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN A LOT OF DETAIL AND EPISODE ONE WHICH I HOPE PEOPLE WILL TAKE THE TIME TO LISTEN TO BECAUSE IT'S SO RICH WITH DEPTH OF UNDERSTANDING AND I'M CERTAIN EVERYONE WILL LEARN A TON ABOUT THEMSELVES AND OTHERS SIMPLY BY LISTENING TO YOUR WORDS IT IM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THAT THAT MAP PROVIDES ESSENTIALLY DESCRIPTION OF THE BINS THE CUPBOARDS TO LOOK IN O TO ARRIVE AT BETTER ANSWERS AND AND EVEN THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT ONE MIGHT ASK IF WE COULD JUST TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE CONTECTS OF THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE OF THIS PERSON WHO MADE THIS REALLY INCREDIBLE CHOICE TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS HIERPANE JOB IM YOU KNOW THEY WERE OVER INDULGING IN IN CERTAIN A MALADAPTED BEHAVIORS AND AGAIN WE WILL USE THIS EXAMPLE BUT IM THIS EXAMPLE IS BUT ONE OF AN INFINITE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THAT WE COULD USE OF THE PERSON WHO'SE YOU KNOW IN A STRUGGLE IHT THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WORKING FOR THEM AND THE'R ALSO NOT DOING THINGS THAT THEY KNOW THEY OUGHT TO BE DOING MOK IM THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR EOPLE TO TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE UM THERE GOAN T BE PEOPLE OUT THER THER THIN HE OUGHT LIKE THIS POOR GUY LIKE HE'S MAKING TONS OF MONEY POOR HIM YOU KNOW BUT YOU KNOW HE WAS EXPERIENCING DEEP E'S MOTHER LACK OF SATISFACTION SO IT COULD IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE REVERSE EXAMPLE LIKE THE PERSON ISN'T IN A JOB THAT THAT BRINGS ABOUT ENOUGH WEALTH FOR THEM AT A TO THRIVE RI CAUSE THE'RE FINANCIAL REALITIES TO LIFE UM SO HES JUST ONE EXAMPLE RIGHT RGHT UT IT'S A GOOD ONE I THINK BECAUSE THE PRISON LEFT THE MONEY RIGHT SO'S I WOT WOULD MAKE YOU LEAVE THAT RIGHTAN IS WHAT WL WOULD MAKE YOU LEVE AT AS IF YOU WERE MISERABLE IN THE SITUATION WITH THAT AND YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE SITUATION WITHOUT IT RIHT SO IT'S ABOUT LEAVING MISERY AND AND FINDING HAPPINESS THAT'S SO IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE WITH US A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR MIND SET DURING THOSE SESSIONS MEANING THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS YOU ASKD HIM ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SELF OR TO REVEAL THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SELF AND THE FUNCTION OF HIS SELF THAT ALOWD TH BOTH OF YOU TO EVENTUALLY SET HIM DOWN THIS A FAR BETTER COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT'S BETTER THAN MOVING AWAY FROM FRUSTRATION AND OVER INDULGENCE IN MALADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR TO DEEP SATISFACTION PIEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT AN TO BECOME A GENERATIVE HUMAN BEING RIGHT SO WE CAN LOOK IN EACH OF THOSE TEN CABINETS RIGHT SO LAS THAT WE LOOK IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND CABINET THERE'S NOT MUCH THERE RHT WHEN THE PERSON WAS GROWING UP IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HAVING MORE MONEY AND HAVING A JOB THAT IMPRESSED PEOPLE WAS WAS AN IMPORTANT THING HE INTERNALIZE IS SOME OF IT SO SOME OF IT'S UNCONSCIOUS BUT BY IN LOR SHE'S AWARE OF IT AND AN TA WAS REVEAL TO YOU HOW HYOU KNOW YOU WOULD ASK HIM A QUESTION ABOUT U YOU'NLY TELL ME ABOUT YOUR OUT BRINGING AND HE WOULD SAY YET LIKE YOU KNOW MONEY WAS IMPORT IN MY FAMILY BUT WE I ALWAYS FELT LIKE WE HAD YOU KNOW ENOUGH WHAT HE WASN'T SUPER WEALTH HY WOULD HAD ENOUGH AND SO WHEN YOU SAY THERE WASN'T A LOT THERE DO YOU MEAN THAT THERE WAS NO KIND OF LIKE EXMARKS THE SPOT OR LIKE IT LIKE BLINKING RED LIGHT LIKE WO THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY IN HIS UNCONSCIOUS MIND THAT'S IN HIS WAY IS IT TO HAVE THAT RIGHT IT WO MORE BECAUSE IT WAS CONSCIOUS RIGHT SO SO HE WAS AWARE THAT IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE BEAT INTO HIM RIGHT LIKE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO BE O CAT RIGHT IT IS S TO HAVE A PRECIDOUS JOB THAT MAKES A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT BUT HE'S AWARE OF IT IF HE WEREN'T AWARE OF IT WE HAVE TO BRING THAT TO LIGHT RIGHT BUT HE WAS AWARES THAT GOOK T HAS A BIG IMPACT ON ME IT MAKES IT HARD TO STEP AWAY LIKE I KNOW I DON'T REALLY CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT THE MONEY BUT I ALSO CAN DO YOU KNOW SURELY MONEY HE MUST I RUS SAY MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS BUT IT CERTAINLY CAN BUFFER CERTAIN STRESSERS IN LIFE RUNNY NOBODY WE CANHE SOMETIMES HE HEAR PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF MONEYSTHING LIKE MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS CAUS HE NON A LOT OF MISERABLE RICH PEOPLE BUT LIK YO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO HAVE A A TWO NIGHT NURSES TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY THAN TO BE THE PERSON WHO HAS TO STAY UP ALL MY TAKING CARE OF A TID ESPECIAL WERE A SINGLE MOTHER  VERSES OR A MOTHER THAT HAS A PARTNER WHO'S 'S WILLING TO PITCH IN  OI E JUST CAN'T CO BEAR AND WHY THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE IN THIS CASE WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT MONEY AS MONEY AS AN ENDPOINT RIGHT THE IDEA THAT NO MATTER NO MATTER WHAT  HOW OW SECURE AND SAFE LIKE IS MORE MONEY BETTER RIGHT AND HE AD AN INTRINSIC OVERVALUE OF THAT RIGHT SO SO IT MADE IT HARDER TO STEP AWAY FROM IT BECAUSE HE HE WAS OVERVALUING IT HE KNEW HE WAS OVER VALUING IT JUST IN ENOUGH ITSELF LITING FOR WHAT IT GETS YOU RIGHT BUT FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MEANING OF IT RIGHT THEN WE LOOK AT HIS DEFENSIVE STRUCTURES IF WE LOOK IN THAT CUPBOARD YEU SEE THAT THE THEY'VE REALLY SHIFTED RIGHT THEY SHIFTED FROM HEALTHY PLACES NOW THERE SORT OF TWISTED AND DISTORTED AND HE'S DOING A LOT OF DENIAL A LOT OF AVOIDANCE A LOT OF RATIONALIZATION RIGHT THA HE'S ENACTING A LOT OF AGGRESSION TOWARDS HIMSELF AND HE'S PROGRET HE'S HE'S DOING A LOT OF PROJECTING LADIES HE'S HARMING HIMSELF WITH THE AUCAL IS PUNISHING HIMSELF IK SO HIS DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE IT CAN BE HEALTHY WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE IT WAS HEALTHIER RIGHT BUT WITTHEN WE SEE THAT IT IS SO TWISTED  SO WE LEARN A LOT FROM THAT RIGHT A LOT IS CONSCIOUS IN THIS PERSON THE DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE CAN BE HEALTHY BECAUSE IT WAS HEALTHY BUT IT'S EVENTUALLY IT WAS HEALTHY WHAT WAS HEALTHY BEFORE I SEE IT WAS HEALTHY BEFORE SO YOU KNOW THAT IT CAN BE HEALTHY AGAIN RIGHT HE HAS IT IN HIM TO HAVE HEALTHY TO FENSE IS TAGEOUS SIGHT OF GETTING AWAY FROM HIM AS HE FELT LESS AND LESS SATISFIED WITH HIS JOB AND MORE AND MORE ANGRY WITH HEMSELF AND MORE MORE MISERABL  THIS IS A REALLY KEE POINT FOR ME AND EVERYONE ELSE TO UNDERSTAND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND FRIENDS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT I WOULD HEAR THIS LIKE I USED TO BE REALLY GOOD IT FITNESS OR I USED TO NOW IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY TIME SO ONE SAID YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD AVESEE ME IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE THE PERSON WHO LETS THEMSELV GO AN AN ARGUBLY IS VERY BUSY WITH WITH PROFESSIONAL DUTIES AND FAMILY DUTIES AND OUU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR TIME IS MORE COMPRESSED IM THAN IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT NONE THE LESS YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THESE SORTS OF TINGS ALL THE TIME LIKE I USED TO HAVE THIS SENSE LIKE I COULD DO THINGS OR THAT LIKE THINGS COULD WORK OUT OR THAT AND THAT IT'S AS IF THERE WAS A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THEMSELV THAT IS COMPLETELY ATROPHIED AND THE NEW VERSION OF THEMSELVE FOR THE THE LATER VERSION OF THEMSELVES RATHER IT JUST SIMPLY LIKE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT ANY MORE LI LAT IS ACT OF TRAMA YE RIGHT O  RIG WHETHER IT'S BIG TRAMA OR IT'S O A BIG ETHANT OR ITS MULTIBLE THINGS LIKE OH THA THE WORLDIS ISN'T REWARDING ME I'M TRYING THE WORLDS NOT REWARDING I'M TRYING THE WORLDS NOT REWARDING ME THAN PEOPLE BECOME DISPIRITED IT I DEMORALIZED SO SO  IT'S THE TRAMA OF THAT THAT TAKES AWAY THTHE SENSE IFSELF THE SENSE OF AGENCY LIKE I THOUGHT I COULD DO THINGS BEFORE NOW I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THINGS RIGHT BUT BUT NOTHING IS REALLY CHANGED IN ME I MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM RIGHT THAN IT'S A PROBLEM THE VAST MAJORITY OF TIMES IT'S BORN OF TRAMA IT IS THAT UM THE SURLY MEAN EARLY CHILD HOD TRAMA OR UM THIS WAS IT COULD BE LATER LIFE TRAMA I BEEN ONE O THE THING'S THAT I I LIKE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SO MUCH IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU THE PSYCHIATRIST IS HEARS I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WELL OR FEEL WELL AND AND THAT'S LIKE IT SOUNDS LIKE IS A A SIGNAL IT'S REALLY A BEACON OF HEALTH THAT STILL EXISTS IN THE PERSON BUT THAT THEY'RE OUT OF T OTCH WITH I THINK FOR FOR MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY THBUT THEMSELVES ARE PEOPLE WHO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY USED TO BE FUNCTIONAL AN SOME DOMAIN AND THEYRE NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL IN THAT DOMAIN ANY LONGER IT SOUNDS AS IF LIKE THINGS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN LIKE LIKE IS IS AS OF A PIECE OF THEM THAT WAS THAT WAS FUNCTIONING LIKE DRIFTED OUT OF THEIR BODY AND LEFT RIGHT BUT I LOVE THE OPTIMISM A RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK SO MUCH OF WHAT WERE INTERESTED COVERING TODAY IS NOT JUST WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND WHY BUT ALSO WHAT'S WORKING AND WHY AND WHAT USED TO WORK AND WHY AND AND THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WITHIN THESE CUPBOARDS THERE CAN BE THE DISCOVERY OF A PROBLEMS A CLEARLY THAT'S WHY ONE GOES TO THE CUPBOARDS RIGHT AS WE'RE DEFINING IT BUT THAT AM THERE'RE A LOT OF ANSWERS THERE ARE THE'RE REST THE INGREDIENTS FOR SUCCESS ALREADY EXISTS WITHIN US RIGHT RIGHT ESPECIALLY IF WE KNOW WE'VE HAD THAT ABILITY BEFORE RIGHT WAS WE KNOW THAT WE HAD IT WAS A THING ABOUT IN THIS MAN HE HE FELT THAT HE COULDN'T MAKE CHANGE LIKE NOW HE'S STOCK RIGHT III I GOT A LOT OF THINGS DONE I WAS ABLE TO TO GET MYSELF INTO THE SCHOOL AND ACHIEVE THIS AND YOU KNOW AND THEN GET THIS JOB LIKE HE COULD DO ALL THOSE THINGS BUT NOW HE FEELS LIKE HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO MAKE HIMSELF HAPPY SO IKE WE KNOW HE COULD DO THAT HE HAD A STRONG SENSE OF AGENCY HE DOESN'T NOW RIGHT AND AND LIKE PEOPLE OFTEN DO THAT THEY FEEL A SENSE OF LOSS LIKE NATURAL I 'VE HAD THIS HAPPEN IN MYSELF LIKE IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHINGS CUT OUT OF YOW AND IF SOMETHING HOLLOW I HAD THAT THING AND NOW I DON'T RIGHT HENCE THE UNBROKEN UNHOPELESS THE THINGS THAT WE HEARE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO THINK ABOUT THE SHIFT IN THIS PERSON SO WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON WHICH ISN'T THAT HARD TO DISCERN WE JUST PAY ATTENTION TO IT SO THAT IF WE RUN UP THE STRUCTURE OF SELF WE SAY LOOK I NOT A LOT OF IT IS RUDED IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT THAT THEREARE ARE PROBLEMS OF OVER VALUING CERTAIN THINGS BUT THEY'RE IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND HE KNOWS LIKE IN HIS HOUSEHOLD OVER DINNER IT WAS YOU KNOW DADERMOM A YOU KNOW O BEING PROUD OF OF SOME DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT I NEW I CHIEVES OIT O THAT NARRATIVE T EXISTS IN ANHES LIKE YILY LIKE MONEY WAS A BIG GDEAL IN MY FAMILY KIND OF THING  BY HE WY I'M NOT SEING AMBOUT MY FAMILY BUT RARELY REATHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MONEY THER ARE DISCUSSIONS AN OTHER THINGS OF COURSE BUT IN IN THIS HYPOTHETICAL HE KNOWS  NOT GRET A REAL PATIENT SORRY G HE KNOWS HE OVERVALUES IT RIGHT HE HE KNOWS IT INDEPENDENT OF WHAT MONEY BUYS AND WHAT HE NEEDS AND ALL THIKE HE JUST PUTS TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE IN MONEY AND HE KNOWS THAT RIGHT SOKA THEIR CONSCIOUS MIND ISSUES HE'S PRETTY AWARE OF THEM AND THE PRETTY CONOFSET IN HIM LIKE THOSE ORE THE ISSUES AND THERE THERE OKE WE LEARND THAT THEN WE GO LOOK AT HIS DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE BOY THAT'S VERY VERY HELPFUL TO TALK BUT WHI LIKE YOUAD A VERY HEALTHY DEFENSEOF STRUCTURE WHAT WERE DOING BEFORE LOT OF SUBLIMATION RIGHT HED YOU ISLAIN SUMBLIMITION IT TAKE ANXIETY TENTION SOMETHING SOMETHING NEGATIVE IN THESELF OR THER COULD BE NEGATIVE ANY CHANNEL TOWARDS SOMETHING POSITIVE READY CHANNEL THAT ENERGY TOWARDS LEARNING RIGHTY CHANNEL SOME OF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE RIGHT INTO SENSE OF AGENCY THAT HA GOT ACHIEVEMENTS O YOU LOOK IN SAID RIGHT THOSE YOU KNOW THAT A'M NET WORK RIGHT OF OF DEFENSE MECHANISM  COMES UP OUT OF IT UNCONSCIOUS MINE WAS LIKE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD RIGHT IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR LIGHT WAS COMING THROUGH IT AND A YOU KNOW IN A WAY THIT WASN'T DISTORTED AND NOW WE COAN LOOK A WHILE LIKE THAT THINGS ARE PRETTY DIFFERENT NOW RIGHT IS AS HE SANG NOW IT'S OCALIC WHAT IT WOULD HE MEAN A I SPENT TEN HOURS OF MY WEEK AND UTTERLY WASTING TIME AND WHAT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT RIGHT OR YO NO HE'S RATIONALIZING EVEN THAT HE LIKES TO DRINK WHEN HE DOESN'T BECAUSE HE SO MATTERED HIMSELF LIKE THE DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE NOW IS TWISTED RIGHT SO E HE SAY OKE WE THAT'S A BIG OBSERVATION RIGHT AND THEN THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT WE FIND A PERSON WHO'S PRETTY GOOD T FIGURING OUT AND UNDERSTANDING THINGS AND COMING RIGHT UP TO THE PRECIPICE OF CHANGE BUT IS A LONG HISTORY OF THAN DIFFICULTY MAKING THE CHANGE RIGHT I KNOW IT AND AMON THE VERGE OF IT BY I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO DO IT LIKE THAT'S IN HIS CHARACTER STRUCTURE BY THE WAYIS SUCH A COMMON TH HIM I MADE PEOPLE THAT NO BETTER KNOW THEY KNOW BETTER SOMETIMES YEU ALMOST HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER NOT IT'S LIKE UM IT'S LIKE A MEDICATION IN THE POCKET LIKE THEY COULD TAKE IT IF THEY WANTED TO THAT THAT MIGHT EVEN GIVE THEM SOME COMFORT BUT THEY JUST DON'T DO IT THEY JUST DON'T ENGAGE IN THE PROPER ACTIONS TO MOVE THEIR LIFE FROM ONE PLACE TO THE NEXT RIGHT AND IF WE LOOK THEN AT THE LEVEL OF STRIVINGS HE DOES KNOW WHAT HE WANTS LIKE HE HE WANTS A FEELING OF CONTENT MIT'S REALLY WHAT HE WANTED WAS A FEELING OF CONTENTMENT A FEELING OF IT I'M TAKING GOOD CARE OF MYSELF I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT'S A VALUE I'M ENJOING DOING IT A HE WANTED THOSE THINGS AND EVEN WHEN WE TALKED MORE HE HAD IDEAS OF WHAT JOBS WOULD DO THAT IN THE BEGINNING HE SAID HE HAD NO IDEAS WHAT HE REALLY MEANT THAT HE SAID TO ME BUT WAS ALSO SAYING TO HIMSELF AS I'VE NO IDEAS OF JOBS THAT WOULD MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR ME THAT PAY AS MUCH AS THE ONE I HAVE RIGHT SO BUT BUT WITHIN HIM WHICH WE GOT TO WERE WERE HE KNEW THAT THERE WERE JOBS IT WOULD MAKE HIM HAPPY HE JUST HAD TO GET OVER THAT THEY WERE LOWER PANG SO THINK OF WHAT WE LEARN ABOUT THAT IS NOTHING LOST IN THIS MAN THERE'S NOTHING CAUGT OUT OF HIM THAT HE'S NOT DAMAGE HE'S NOT HOPELESS AND NOW HE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT AND THAT HE UNDERSTAND ISELF ACTUALY PRETTY WELL RIGHT AND AND HIS CONSCIOUS MINE IS IS APPREHENDING PRETTY WELL WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHERE HE WANTS TO GO BUT BOY AS HE HASN'T TAKEN GOOD CARE OF HIMSELF THE DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE GETS ORT OF WARD AND THAT IT MAKES IT A LOT HARDER TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF ITS UCH MAKING OTHER PROBLEMS IN LIFE AND HE STARTS LIKE FEELING LOUSY ABOUT HIMSELF LIKE MAYBE I CAN'T DO MUCH OF ANYTHING RIGHT WHY BECAUSE WORK ISN'T GOING AS WELL BECAUSE HE'S DRINKING TOO MUCH AND IF WOLL PERFORMANCE GOES DOWN RIGHT SO WE CAN SEE THAT AN THAND YOU KNOW WHAT'S OF MOST INTEREST THERE IS THAT THERE'S A CHARACTER STRUCT U THAT CAN COME RIGHT UP TO THE PRECIPICE BUT NOT BUT NOT PULL TE TRIGGERS O TO SPEAK ON WHAT THE THINT THE THING THE PRERSON WANTS TO DO BECAUSE NOW WE START GETTING OH HEH AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON RIGHT AND THEN IF WE LOOK AT FUNCTION OF SELF ITS LOOK IN THOSE CABINETS TOO RIGHT TO HELP CAN BE MRE AWARE OF THERE'S AN EYE HERE WHICH HE WAS PRETTY WELL AWARE OF BUT NOT ENOUGH LIE THERE'S A PERSON HERE OM SHEPHERDING THROUGH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THE DAY RIGHT LIKE I AM AND I AND I'M AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF ME AND I CAN MAKE ME HAPPY WE CAN MAKE ME MISERABLE IT LET'S LET'S LET'S BE MORE AWARE OF THAT HOW DID YE GO ABOUT DOING THAT BECAUSE I FIND THIS THIS FIRST STEP WITHIN ADDRESSING THE FUNCTION OF SELF YOU KNOW SELF AWARENESS AND REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A THERE'S AN THERE'S AN EYE THERE'S A ME AND AM MOVING MYSELF THROUGH LIFE I FIND THIS TO BE SO INTERESTING AND ON THE ONE HAND KIND OF OBVIOUS LIKE AY THERE'S ITERS ME LIKE TANGIBLE THING YOU LOOK IN THE MARRY YOU SEE YOURSELF BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S A BIT ABSTRACT I THINK TO ME IN TO MANY PEOPLE OUFILIN HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT BUILDING UP A SENSE OF SELF IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES POSITIVE AGENCY IN THE WORLD IS IT TO TELL YOU KNOW WEEK HERE ALL THE TIME AT THESE LIKE AFFIRMATIONS AND I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE LOOK AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND SAY YOU ARE ENOUGH IN THESE AND I'M NOT MAKING FUN OF THESE PEOPLE RIGHTI SHALL HAVE MY OWN INTERNAL AMLIST THAT I I TELL MYSELF ON WAKING EVERY MORNING WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POSITIVE AFFIRMATION IS JUST ASHLLY DEFINING THE DIFFERENT ROLLS THAT I PLAY I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS USEFUL TO ME BUT I FIND IT INCREDIBLY USEFUL TO ME U IT REMINDS ME WHO I AM IT ALSO REMINDS  OR IT LEAST REASSURES ME THAT I DON'T HAVE AANY DIMENSOR YET AH SO O IYOU KNOW WE'LL SEE GOING FORWARD BUT AM HOPELY NOT BUT  YET LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS THIS LINE OF INQUIRY WITHIN THE THE CATEGORY OF SELF AWARENESS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER CHALLENGES AT THEY THEY MIGHT BE HAVING OR NOT HAVING WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE HIM WHAT YOU THINK THAT ACCOMPLISHES AT THE LEVEL OF SELF UNDERSTANDING AND AN AGENCY IN THE WORLD TO ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT THAT IS IN THIS OUT THE WORDS I WOULD USE BUTLIWHAT'S PERVADING A PERSON AND SO TO SET SET E SETIN STANG I WHICH YOU CAN DISCERN BY INQUIRY SOS FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE THE PERSON SO THERE'S A PERSON RIGHT WHO WOULD REALLY NOT THINK THIS IS OQUET RIGHT THIS PERSON TAKING A JOB AT TEN PER CENT OF THE PREVIOUS PAY IN THE JOB AS HAS LESS PRESTIGE RIGHT WAS A ERSON WHO WOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT AND VERY FAULTING OF THAT AND AND TALK TO THIS PERSON MY PATIENT THROUGH THE LENS OF IT HE SHOULD FEEL SHAME FOR THAT THAT PERSON'S NOT ALIVE THE PERSON IS NOT ALIVE SO ONE WAY OF LOOK AS WHAT MASTER ARE YOU SERVING RIGHT AND A LOT LIKE THE GIVEN SIKE THE AUTOMATICITY IN HIM WAS AS IF LIKE THAT PERSON WAS S OF ALIVE INSIDE OF HIM REALLY ISTELLING HIM LIKE HOLLUS WAS IN OUCETIC WHIS FIGHTING THAT HE WASN'T AWARE THAT HAY THAT SOME OTHER PERSON'S VOICE IT WAS IK ESA GOM VERY VERY CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS ACTUALLY HE WASN'T VERY CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS WAY WHEN HE STARTS FOCUSING ON THE EYE I WHAT I ACTUALLY THINK WUTOL ACTULLYU THNK I DON'T I DON'T CARE IF I MAKE NINEY PER CENT LESS LIKE I DON'T CARE MY NEITER MET I PUT SOME MONEY AWAY I WANT TO BE HAPPY I'M NOT CONFLICTED LIKE SO SO BUT IN ORDER TO GET THERE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AT THE EYE HOW MUCH IS THAT I AT SENTER STAGE RIGHT IIN ALL THAT I DON'T MEAN TO TET IN SOME WAY LIKE PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS OUT WER LIKE WE'RE ALL ACTING THROUGH THE LENS OF THE EYE NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE CHOOSING RIHT SO TO BE AWARE OF THAT AND DO I WANT TO BE IMPACTED BY THE OPINIONS OF THIS OTHER PERSON CAUSE I CAN LET SOME ONE ELSE'S OPINIONS VERY MUCH AND  WE ALL DO RIGHT VERY MUCH IMPACT MY THOUGHTS BUT I WANT A KIND DECIDE THAT DO I REALLY VALUE THAT PERSON'S OPINIONS I DON'T WANT THEM AUTOMATICALLY INSIDE MY HEAD TELLING ME HOW I FEEL ABOUT MYSELF I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE I KNOW COME TO ME IN A PLACE OF STRUGGLE EVEN O NOT A CLINICION AND AS I LISTEN TO WHAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH ITS SO CLEAR THAT THEY KNOW THE BEST ANSWER IN ROUT FORWARD BUT THAT THEIR DEALING WITH SOME INTERNAL OPPRESSIVE VOICE ABOUT WHETHER NOT THEY ARE A GOOD PERSON OR A BAD PERSON WHETHER NOT THE CHOICE THEY WANT TO MAKE IS REALLY A GOOD CHOI CE AT ALL I SOMETIMES THOSE VOICES ARE THE VOICES OF PARENTS UM IBE YOU KNOW IN THESE PARTICULAR EXAMPLES IT WERE THE VOICES OF AMPEERS AM AND SO I THINK O UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS GETTING REALLY FIRMLY RUTED IN WHO A PERSON IS FOR THEMSELVES AND WHAT THEY REALLY VALUE AND WHAT THEY WHAT THEY REALLY KNOW TO BE TRUE FOR THEMSELVES AND REALLY TRYING TO NOT A SURELY QUIET THOSE VOICES BUT SEE THOSE VOICES TRULY AS OTHER EVEN THOUGH THEY COME FROM WITH WITHIN THEIR HEAD YES AT RIGHT YES YES TO TO STOP AND THINK WHAT VOICES DO I WANT INSIDE SO SO MAYBE I WANT THE VOICE OF A KIND MENTOR WHO STILL HELD ME TO ACCOUNT ENO FOR A VERY HIGH STANDAR I SE GOOD VOICE TO HAVE INSIDE OF ME IO FEUROS EM I MY UC I NOT BE A GOOD VOICE IS I SAY A NOT SO KIND MEN TOR FOR WHOM YOU CAN NEVER DO ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH THAT'S NALSO BUT MAYBE YOU TAKE PART OF THAT NEW LEAF PART OF THAT BUT T THE EARLIER AND MORE FORMIDIVE THE VOICES ARE THE MORE THER IN OUR HEAD AUTOMATICALLY LI THINK THAT THAT MAN THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DEEPLY CONFLICTED ABSOLUTELY HUNDRED PER CENT E TELNT AND IN AS HE WAS RIGHT LIKE HIS EXPERIENCE WAS TO BE DEEPLY CONFLICTED BUT WHEN YOU GO IN AND DIG THE JAC IF HOU JUST DIG AND YOU AND YOU GET TO LIKE OKY THE EYE IS IN O ASSESS THIS THESE HES NOT CONFLICTED AT ALL I WHICH IS WHY THIF YOU'RE COMING UP THE FUNCTION OFSELF LATTER TATIN YOU LOOK AT DEFENCE MECHANISMS AN ACTION RIGHT AND WHAT'S ON TOP OF THAT SAILIN SO I NOWS WHEN YOU I CREATES AN IMMEDIACY RIGT SO DEFENSCE MECHANISMS AND ACTION SORT OF INFORME THE PROCESS AND SAY HAY THE DEFENCES ARE SHIFTING TO DENIAL ACTING OUT RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT SORTER GIVES US A TIME HORIZE AND LIKE THIS THINGS THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE OQUE RIGHT THAT IF HE KEPT DOWN THIS PATH WHAT WAS VERY CLEARLY GOING A HAPPIN YOU'LL HAVE TO ROLL TO TAKE FORWARD THAT MUCH TO SEE THAT HE'S IN THE LOSIST JOB RIGHT HE'S CAN FEEL VERY SHAMED OF THAT LIKE A BUNCH OF NEGATIVE THINGS OR GING TO HAPPEN SO I HELPS THE PERSON APPREHEND THAT LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERELIKE I'M CHANGING RIGHT BECAUSE IKE IN SOMEWAY I'M THINKING NOW THAT IT'S OKAY THAT I'M WASTING TEN HOURS ON SOMETHING THAT I COULD REALLY ENJOY IF I SPEND NINETY MINUTES ON IT LIKE I BAT WELL I'M KIND OF LOSING A LITTLE BIT A PERSPECTIVE THAT RIGHT SO IT IT ADDS A SENCE LIKE A FRAMES A SITUATION RIGHT AND THE SAILIENTS O COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON ON THIS DEFENSE MECHANISM IN ACTION OF ACTING OUT NOW I THINK A RECOVERED AN EPISODE ONE AND I'M SURE WILL COME UP SEVERAL TIMES MORE DURING TO DAY'S DISCUSSION ABOUT THINGS LIKE DENIAL PROJECTION DISPLACEMENT ET CETERA TH THOSE DEFENSE MECHANISMS AM SEEM AT THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DEFINITION BUT ACTING OUT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR MORE AND MORE ABOUT THESE DAYS LIKE THEIR ACTING OUT A UT WHAT IS ACTING OUT UM IS IT IS IT ACTING OUT OF SOME CONFLICT AM IS IT TRYING TO A YOU KNOW DEMOLISH A A STRUGGLE BY BY GOING AN DOING SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN THINK OF IT AS BUY AN LARGE AN UNHEALTHY MANIFESTATION OF A LOT OF AGGRESSION WHICH COULD BE A VERY HIGH AGGRESSIVE DRIVE OR AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THAT'S NOT TOO HIGH BUT IS THEN FURTHER I ITS POWERS FURTHER BY A NEGATIVE SITUATION I SAY LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE THE ACTING OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE INSIDE OF THIS PERSON IS HE WAS VERY VERY MAD RIGHT AND THIS ISN'T A PERSON WHO TO EXPRESS A LOT OF ANGER RIGHT SAY OR HAD OUTLETS FOR  RIGTY HE WASN'T GOING AN RUNNING TEN MILES OR RGHT  THIS WAS ALL INSIHT OF HIM HE WASN'T GETTING IT OUT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO WHAT HE SIRT'S DOING IS HE STARTS ACTING OUT THE ANGER NOW HE'S ANGRY AT THE WORLD AROUND HIM BECAUSE HE'S UNHAPPY IN IT AND IT'S NOT GIVING HIM MORE CHOICES NOW OF COURSE THIS IS ABOUT HIM AND NOT THE WORLD AROUND HIM RIGHT BUT BUT HE'S FEELING AN ANGER TOWARDS THE WORLD THAT WON'T CO OPERATE RIGHT AND HE'S ANGRY TOWARDS HIMSELF RIGHT BECAUSE IK HE CAN'T MAKE HIMSELF HAPPY LOOK LOOK AT ALL THIS LOOK AT ALL THAT HE DID AND LOOK HOW MISERABLE HE IS RIHT SO A WAY OF ACTING OUT THEN WWAS IS TE DRINKING RIGHT BECAUS A DRINK IS TO HELP WITH THE WORLD RIGHT YOU THINK I SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING AT NIGHT AND COMING TO WORK HONG OVER I I'LL DO IT ANYWAY RIGHT TO HELP WITH THE WORLD SO I AVE SNUBBING HIS NOSE AT THE WORLD RIGHT HE'S ALSO SNUBBING HIS NOSE AT HIM RIGHT TO HELP WITH ME RIGHT THE GUY WHO NOW DOESN'T COME ACROSS THE WAY HE DID BEFORE BECAUSE I'M SHOWING UP AT WORK NOT IN THE RESPONSIBLE WAY I SHOWED UP BEFORE BAN WETS A LITTLE DISHEVELLED FUNCTION IS LOWER TO HELP WITH ME RIGHT'SO FOR M SELF DENIGRATION LIKE LET PEOPLE THINK WORSE OF ME RIGHTCAUSE WHYT BECAUSE IM SO MAD AT MYSELF THAT I THINK IT'S JUSTIFIED RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE INVITING OF IF I IF I REALLY HAVE  EDDICTION PROMEM HERE I LOSE MY JOB IS LIKE FIND I DESERVE THAT TO RIGHT BECU THT THERE'S AN ACTING OUT AGAINST THE SELF THAT IF THE PERSON DOESN'T STOP AND LOOK AT THAT THAT CAN BECOME TRUE RIGHT CAUSE THAT PERSON DIDN'T REALLY WASN'T BUILT TO SAY TO HEL WITH THE WORLD AND WITH ME OR DO NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND IT WHAT'S TO HELP THE WITH THE WORLD MEAND IT ALSO MEANS TO HELP WITH ME AND IT'S NOTHING FOR THE WORLD OR ME RIGHT BUT HE WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE WE WED LOOK T LIKE WHAT WHAT'S SHIFTED IN YOU THIS A PERSON DID A LOT OF SUPBLEMATION BEFORE WHO NOW ALL THAT'S GOING INTO ACTING OUT SO THEY'RE NOT TAKING NEGATIVE ENERGY AND DOING SOMETHING GOOD WITH IT THER  THE TAKING NEGATIVE ENERGY IN DOING THINGS IT ARE BAD WITH IT WHY BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH IS A LOT OF NEGATIVE ENERGY IT'S OVERWHELMING EVERYTHING ELSE AND THEN IT'S GOING DOWN THESE PATHWAYS WHERE THE THE UNHEALTHY DEFENSES ARE ALWAYS BECKONING US SEND THE ENERGY DOWN HERE IT'S EASIER TO AVOID THAN IT IS TOFACE SOMETHING AND FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT IT'S EASIER TO JUST ACT OUT THAN IT IS TO HOLD WHAT'S INSIDE OF US AND THEN THINK ABOUT WHY IT'S THERE SO THE UNHEALTHY DEFENCES ARE BECKONING US AND FOR HIM TO SEE EYOU YOU HAVE HAD A HEALTHY DEFENSEIV STRUCTURE LIKE YOU CAN BE HEALTHY AGAIN YOU'RE NOT BROKEN RIGHT BUT TO ALSO SEE THE WAY THESE DEFENCES ARE GOING IS BRINGING REAL RISK TO YOU TOUR TO YOUR ABILITY OBE HAPPIER YOU GET FURTHER DOWN THE SHAME AND LOST PATH THAT CAN BE HARD SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PERSON TO GET BACK SO IT SETS THE STAGE ALIKE THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT WHAT THESE DEFENSES ARE HOW THEY'RE BEING ENACTED AND FOR HIM TO BEEBEISITA LIKE A THIS COULD BE HEALTHY BUT IT'S NOT NOW YET THES SUM SLOW AYOU KNOW DEGRADING FORMS OF ACTING OUT AND SELF SABATAGE AN SABATAGE OF OTHERS I I THINK ARE A PTHE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS ONES BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY'RE SLOW AND THEY THE SOMETIMES TE THE CHANGE IS IMPERCEPTIBLY SLOW AND THEN ONE DAY SOMEBODY ARRIVES AT A PLACE FORE AS HE SET YEOU KNOWN THE FOR SHE CAN'T GET BACK OR THAT  IT REQUIRES UM YOU 'RE GOING INTO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT ORE THINGS THAT REALLY  YOU KNOW BIG DEPARTURE YES UM EGEALERS IN ORDER TO GET BACK INTO LIFE AND U YEN I WOULD NEVER WISH FOR SOMEBODY TO CHOOSE TO ACT OUT BY DRIVING OFF A CLIFF INSTEAD BUT BUT THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF ACTING OUT THAT IMMEDIATELY WAKE PEOPLE UP UM BUT IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN SELECT THOSE THEY SELECT THESE MORE SUBTLE FORMS OF ACTING OUT WHERE THEY DON'T GET CAUGHT AND THEY WERE THEY WERE NO ONE'S CALLING THEM OUT ON ON IT BECAUSE YOU KOW THAT YOU KNOW PLENTY OF PEOPLE HAVE FIVE OR SIX DRINKS AT HAPPY HOUR RIGHT AS APPOST OF FIFTY YOU KNOW SO U SO IT'S ITSELF SLOW SELF SABATAGE I SUPPOSED TO IMMEDIATE SELF DESTRUCTION UM AND AGAIN WE'RE TELIG ABOUT ALCOHOL BUT WE TIK ABOUT FOOD VIDIO GAMES SOCIAL MEDIA UM AARGUING WITH SPOUS SOMMING ALL F THESE KINDS OF THINGS THAT BUILD UP OVER TIME TO EVENTUALLY DELIVER PEOPLE TO A PLACE OF OF REAL REAL PROBLEMS U I'CURIOUS FOR THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL YOU WORKED WITH SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED THEY THEY STARTED THIS PROCESS OF OF SELF INQUIRY AROUND SELF AWARENESS AND U DID YOU SEE THAT THE A SALIENTE THAT IS WHAT THEY PAID ATTENTION TO INTERNALLY IN EXTERNALLY IMMEDIATELY SHIFTED IN THE DEFENSE MECHANISM UM OF ACTING OUT IMIMMEDIATELY DISSOLVED AM IN WHAT WAS THE KIND OF COMTOUR IN TIME AND TIME COURSE IT THIS THE AS LESS SOSO WE'RE LOOKING IN THE CABINETS THERE'S A LOT IN THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND ACTION CABINET THERE'S NOT AS MUCH IN THE SALIENT'S CABINET BECAUSE THIS IS THE MAJOR THING ON HIS MIND I ABOVE ALL ELSE LIKE AN AN HE IS HAVING INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS ABOUT I AND HIS SELF TALK WAS ABOUT IT BUT WE KIND OF ARDY KNEW THAT YOU KNOW JUST LIKE WE KNEW WHIT WAS IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND SO YOU THINK WORES THE MONEY AT I IS NOT AS MUCH IN THAT REALM BECAUSE HE'S AWARE OF IT IF HE THOUGHT  I'M NOT THIS ISN'T BOTHERING ME VERY MUCH AN ANYTHING WHILE ALL HIS INTERNAL DIALOGUE IS ABOUT IT RIGHT THEY LIKE OKA THERE'S A WAT THERE'S A LOT TO ACHIEVE THERE BUT JUST AS HE BROUGHT A LOT THAT WAS UNCONSCIOUS INTO THE CONSCIOUS MIND WAS AWARE OF IT IM IT WAS SALIT THERE'S LESS TO DO THERE I BECAUSE THE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND AND CHANGE ARE NOT RESIDING SO MUCH THERE FOR PEOPLE THAT ER NO DOUBT EVERYONE AS EENG BOUT THEIR OWN INTERNAL PROCESSES AND 'M AND WHERE THEY COULD ASK BETTER QUESTIONS AND AND ARRIVE AT BETTER ANSWERS TO HELP THEMSELVES ALONG IM PERHAPS HE COULD A ELABORATE LO IT MORE ON THIS SALIENTS CUPBOARD UNDER FUNCTION OF SELF YO IT TO ME SALIENTS IS WHAT'S MOST APPARENT IM AN AND O AS YOU TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY AND AGAIN TO DAY YO THERE'S THIS INTERNAL NARRATIVE LIKE WHAT'S ON MY MIND OFTENER WHAT KIND OF JUMPS TO MIND I'M I'VE STARTED DOING THIS RECENTLY BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS HERE IM AND I'VE NOTICED THAT UNDER DIFFERENT STATES OF AROUSAL AND HERE I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SLEEPINESS VERSES ALERTNESS TYPE AROUSAL IK WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING OR WHEN I'M TIRED IN THE EVENING YOU KNOW WHERE MY MIND IS THAT WHERE IT DEFAULTS TO IM AND WHAT I'M PAYING ATTENTION TO THROUGHOUT THE DAY IM IS THAT YOU JUST ASKING MYSELF TO NOTICE AND I'VE CERTAINLY NOTICE OM SOME A SOME PATTERNS IM I FORINCE AS I'VE NOTICED AT ANY TIME IM MY OVER ALL STATE IS ELEVATED MORE ALERTNESS OR IN THE IDDLE VEX I MY MIND GOES TO OME I'M NOT SO PLEASANT THOUGHTS IM AND IT'S INTERESTING TO ME IT'S LIKE WHIL THIS IS STRONGLY CORRELATED WIS ST TES OF INTERNAL AROUSAL THAT ARE HEALTHY EXERCISE YOU A WITHIN LIMITED FRAME AS IS OR EXERCISES I IN GENERAL IF DONE IN A HEALTHY WAY IS HEALTHY IM AND WHEN I'M SLEEPY THOSE THOUGHTS NEVER COME ABOUT A WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING CERTAIN THOUGHTS TEND TO LEAP TO MIND OTHER THOUHTS NOWS THE SORT OF CATEGARIZATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF THOUGHTS DEPENDING ON MY INTERNAL STATE IS THAT THE SORT OF LINE OF INCRY THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE UM SUGGESTING OR DESCRIBING HERE YES AS ETIGES WED HALF THE PICTURE RICAUS HALF THE PICTURE WOULD BE WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOUR MIND IS TOOD OF AT REST RIGHT WHAT WHAT IS THEN STARTS PLAYING ITSELF RIGHT IN YOUR MIND THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS WHAT COMES TO THE FOR WHEN THER'S A LOT O COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION RIGHT SO I'MSEMAKING THIS UP BUT BUT THE IDEA THAT LIKE IF HE STUBBED HIS TOE REALLY BADLY HEED STILL BE THINKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT CAUS IT'S SO MUCH POWER NOW AGEN MAYBE IF COBITY IS A BADLY BROKEN BONE IS A LOT OF PAIN BUT HE SIN'T THINK OF THAT FIRSI BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF OTHER STIMULUS TO TO BE MORE SALIENT THAN THIS RIGHT SO YOU SO YOU CAN LIKE A WHAT'S COMING IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOUR MIND IS HOOD OF FREE AND OPEN THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT AND THEN WHAT'S WINNING OUT WHEN THERE'S  HIH ROUSAL STATE IN A LOT OF COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IM AGAIN I THINK A LONG WITH THIS UM SELF AWARENESS PIECE IM THE ASKING OF ONESELF ON BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MY MIND WHEN I'M INDIFFERENT DATES OR THROUGHOUT THE DAY IM AND AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING NOW ALSO INCLUDING WHEN M THERE OTHER THINGS AVAILABLE TO THINK ABOUT LIKE DOES THAT INCLUDE HOW OFTEN I'M DISTRACTED BY A PARTICULAR THOUGHT MY COMMING CHIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY MY MIND GOES FROM THE CONVERSATION I MIGHT BE IN TO SOMETHING ELSE ORIS YES DOES IT HIGH JACK YOUR ATTENTION YOU KNOW TIS ONE WAY PUTTING IN A LOT OF PEOPLE IM MENTION TO ME CHALLENGES WITH INTRUSIVE HOUGHTS M WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THOSE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS OR IS IT SIMPLY A MATTER OF PAYING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THERE THERE AND UM AND THEN THINKING ABOUT THAT THE ORIGINS OF THOSE THOUGHTS ABSOLUTELY ONE EX THAT WE COULD HAVE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS BECAUSE THERE'S TRAMA IN YOUR BACKGROUND MAY BE VERY CLEAR TRAMA THAT YOU'RE NOT FACING AN REGRET AND ADDRESSING THEN OV INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS A SAY I'M NOT SAFE LOOKI GO LOOK FOR WHAT'S STILL AN UNCONSCIOUS MORANDER WHEN IT COMES OUT A LITTLE BIT YOU PUT BACK INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND THAT WOULD BE IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT CCENARIA THAN LIKE IN THIS CASE THIS MAN WAS HAVING INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS ABOUT HIS JOP SITUATION IS OVER ALL SITUATION AND IT MADE SENSE THAT HE WAS HAVING THOSE INTRUSIVE THEY WERE MARKERS OF THE ACUITY OF IT I I LUKY YOU IVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OR SOMETHING VERY BAD IS CAN HAP AND SO THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THEREN HIS MADE SENSE I LIKE THIS IS NOT GOING WELL AND AN YOUR MIND IS IVE FORCING YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS BECAUSE TIME REALLY AV IS OF THE ESSENCE YOUR REAL RISK NOW SO INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS CAN BE ANYTHING FROM AS THEY OFTEN ARE THEY THENKME MARKERS OF SOMETHING THIS TRAMATIC SOMETHING IS ONDING NEATH THE SURFACE SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY BOTHERING US THAT WE SHOVE DOWN THAT'S MAKING GUILT SHAME DISTRESS OF ONABILITY THAT'S THAT'S VERY OFTEN THE CASE BUT SOMETIMES INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS ARE MARKE UBLIKE ALL RIGHT THAT'S A THING TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND ONCE WE IDENTIFY THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHT MENT HOW DO WE ERADICATE IT I MEAN HOW DO WE I WORK WITH IT I MEAN A WTALKING ABOUT TRAMA NOW IN O UM OF COURSE E MIGHT MAP BACK TO A CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE I'M SOME INTERNAL NARRATIVE BUT U IS THERE SOME ROD MAP FOR MOVING INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS FROM A PLACE OF INTRUSIVE IN DISTURBING TO SIMPLY THERAN KIND OF MEH UM I MEAN TO BE WONDERFUL TO IT A DELEATE SWITCH BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WORK LIKE THAT WIL IT LUS TAK IF WE COULD THIS EXAMPLE IT WHICH IS LITTLE BI DIFFERENT IF WE IF WE RUN THROUGH THIS EXAMPLE OF THE PERSON IN THE JOB BECAUSE THEN WWE SHOULD TALK ABOUT FROM A DRIVEN IN TRUSIVE THOUGHTS WHICH AS I IN MANY WAYS THE BIGGEST TOPIC ABOUT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS BUT THINK OF THAT THIS PERSON HERE IF WE GO UP FROM SALIENTS WE LOOK AT BEHAVIORIS RIGHT AND BEHAVIOUR ACTUALLY NOW IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT THIS PERSON IS DRINKING THEIRE STILL GOING TO THAT JOB THEY DON'T WANT THEYT HAVEN'T GONE AN INTERVIEW FOR THE JOBS THEY WANT RIGHT SO WE START LOOKING AT THE BEHAVIORS THAT ARE MAKING PROBLEMS THE CHANGES IN BEHAVIORS THAT COULD MAKE THINGS BETTER RIGHT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE ARRIVE AT STRIVINGS AND I THINK WHEN I'S TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURE OF SELF I THINK AT LEAST ONE TIME I MISS SPOKANS AD SAID STRIVING INSTEAD OF SELF AT THE TOP OF THESE PYRAMIDS SELF AND STRIVING HAVE A LOT OF OVERLAP RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GROWING A HEALTHY SELF RIGHT OUT OF  THE SUITOF TOP OF THE STRUCTURE OF SELF PYRAMID THEN THAT SELF AS GOING TO BE AWARE OF STRIVINGS AND AND IS CAN BE BETTER ABLE TO ENACK THEM SO IN O HIS HIS SENSI SELF WAS SHAKEN HERE BUT HE WAS AWARE OF THE STRIVINGS FOR A BETTER LIFE RIHT SO NOW LET'S THE ROAD MAP ITS INTERESTING MAKE AUS THE ROAD MAP IS HIS ROAD MAP RIGHT IF WE LOOK IN THOSE TEN CUPBORDS WE COME UP WITH A ROAD MAP AND AND A ROAD MAP DOESN'T HAVE A SPENDING VERY MUCH TIME IN LIKE UNCONSCIOUS LAND RIGHT BECAUSE IT HE ISN'T REALLY NEED THAT RIGHT IF WE LOOK AT WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE FOR HIM WHAT DID WE DO RIGHT WE REALLY CULTIVATED THE SELF AWARENESS THE EYE THAT IS MAKING DECISIONS FOR HIM WE LOOKED AT HOW HIS DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE HAD CHANGED AN THE THINGS HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE NOW AND THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE THERE BEFORE AND HOW COULD HE GET BACK SOME OF THAT HOW COULD HE TRAN BACK TOWARDS WHAT WAS WORKING BEFORCE WE START TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT AND THEN WE GO FROM THERE REALLY TO CHANGING BEHAVIORS O LIKE IT REQUIRES A BEHAVIORAL CHANGE WHICH IS NOT TO WALK UP TO THE PRECIPICE OF DOING THIS EACH DAY BUT TO ACTUALLY DO IT RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS VERY CLEAR ALL THE VEC ER SO TO SPEAK INSIDE OF WHO WERE POINTING TOWARDS DOING IT AND THAT THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THIS SELF BEING HEALTHIER THAT GARDEN GROWING ON TOP OF THE STRUCTURE AND THE STRIVINGS THAN BEING REALIZED SO FOR HIM THAT WAS THE ROAD MAP AND THE INTHE INTHE SALIENTS FOIT WASN'T REALLY PART OF IT BECAUSE THE INTRUSIVENESS THE SALIENCE BIAS INSIDE OF HIM MADE SENSE AND THAT LIKE OF COURSE IT WENT AWAY ONCE HE MADE THE DECISIONS RIGHT BECAUSE HTHE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS OF LIKE YOUIVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT OUS TO FIGURE THIS OUT R IIT WEREN'T THERE ANY MORE ALONG WITH THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS OF YOU'LL NEVER FIGURE THIS OUR LEG IT GOES AWAY BECAUSE HE MADE THE CHANGE BUT HE MADE THE CHANGE CAUSE WE LOOKED AT SELF AWARENESS WE STRENGTH AN SELF AWARENESS WE LOOKED AT DEFENCE MECHANISMS HOW THEY COULD BE VERSES HOW THEY ARE WE LOOKED AT THE BEHAVIORAL CHANGE WHICH WAS REALLY NECESSARY AND THEN ALSO REFERENCING A CHARACTER STRUCTURE THAT HAD HAS DIFFICULTY RIGHT COMING COMING ACROSS THE PRECIPICE RIGHT SO WE WE SELL GET US TA BASELONE CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM WE CANN'T UNDERSTAND THAT BUT HOW DO WE HELP HIM CHANGE THE BEHAVIORS ANYWAY WHEN HE DOES THAT THE SELF WAS IN A BETTER HAPPIER HEALTHIER PLACE THE STRIVINGS ARE REALIZED THIS PERSON THAT STOPS DRINKING IN THE WAY THEY WERE THEY START DOING THE THE ENJOYMENT ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE THEY START DOING THEM WITHIN REASONABLE BOUNDS AGAIN THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES PERSON SMILING THAT THE AN NOW THINK THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS MUCH MORE FULFILLED SO SO WHAT COMES ON TOP OF THOSE PILLARS RIT IS THAT PERSON IS A SENSE OF HUMILITY RIGHT EN NOUGH HUMILITY TO SOUND AND WALK AWAY FROM THIS JOB I DON'T IS OKAY THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE JOBBLES THANK COME CRAZY HOW COULD YOU LEAVE THAT AND AND LIKE E TRIGGUR SOMETHING IN ME IN SOME WAY LIKE IT'S OKA RELIC I DON'T I DON'T HAVE TO YOU KNOW I'M NOT OUT THERE FOR THAT I'M NOT OUT THERE FOR THE BIG THING THAT EVERYBODY IS IS GUIDING I CAN O THE HUMILITY TO GO TO THE JOB THAT I NO MAKES HE DIFFERENCE AND FEELS GOOD TO ME IGHT HE'S IMPOWER TO MAKE CHANGE HE'S WERN'T MOVING AWAY FROM DIS THE DISEMPOWERMENT TO THE ALCOHOL AND THE AVOID INCE IGHT SO THERE'S EMPOWERMENT IN HUMILITY AND AN ABS LY IF HE TALKED TO THAT PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT LOOKED SHORTLY ASE WAS ENACTING IT RIGHT GETTING JUST TO THE OTHER SIDE OF IT WHO WAS SO MUCH EMPOWERMENT AND SO MUCH HUMILITY WHICH WERE THEN BROUGHT TO BEAR THROUGH A SENSE OF AGENCY THAT MADE THE CHANGES RIGHT THAT CHANGE THE JOB THAT STOPPED DRINKING THE DEALT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT NEGATIVELY OF IT RIGHT THROUGH A SENSE OF GRATITUDE OF IT'S NOT AWFUL THAT I I ON GA TO GO MAKE LESS MONEY A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THAT TO HIM LIKE HOW COULD YOU DO IT WAS SO TERRIBLE IT I'S NOT TERRIBLE RIGHT I'M GRATEFUL IF YOU AR GON DOGAN GO MAKEIN AMAN OF MONEY THAT THAT'S ALL THAT I NEED RIGHT SO IT WAS LIKE THAT'S WHAT HELPS A PERSON DO THAT THING AND THAT'S ATURALLY TRUE RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WHAT MATTER TO HIM SO ENACTIVATED AND ACTIVE A VERB SENSE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUD THEN LEADS HIM TO THE PLACE WHERE THERE WAS AT PEACE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT HE WAS DELIGHTING IN THE JOB THAT HE CHOSE AND HIS GENERATIVE DRIBE WAS IN ACCORD WITH IT YOU KNOW THEN AN SHOULD WE WE STOPPED SOMEPONE WORKING TOGETHER HE DIDN'T NEED ME ANY MORE HE COULD LWAYS COME BACK BUT WOULDN'T NEED ME ANY MORE AND HE LOOK AT HOWER THOSE LAST SESSIONS A LOT OF THE LAST SESSIONS WERE HIM LIK IN AN EXCITED WAY TELLING ME WHAT HE WAS DOING RIGHTLY GONE AN WE DID THIS AN II DID THIS I FIGURED THIS ATLIC HE WAS SO HAPPY BAD IN YOU COULD SEE THAT MAN'S GENERATIVE DRIVE WHICH NATURALLY NATURALLY IS QUITE HIGH IN HIM BUT WAS BEING SQUELCHED RIGHT THAT BRINGS HIM OUT OF BALANCE NOW THE GENERATIVE JRIB WAS IN QUITE A GOOD PLACE AND HE HAD ENOUGH OF GRASSION OR ASSERTION RIGHT TO TO GO AND DO THAT JOB AND TO DO THAT WELL AND AND EVEN ENOUGH TO COUNTER ANYBODY WHO WOULD STILL KIND A RISE UP AND SAY THAT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA HE COULD COUNTER ALL THAT HE WAS GETTING PLEASURE FROM IT HE DIDN'T MEED TO SEE PLEASURE BY WHAT NOT EVEN PLEASURE BECAUSE ALCOHOL WAS PLEASURABLE NO PLEASURE BECAUSE HARMING HIMSELF AND SAYING TO HELP WITH YOU TO THE WORLD AND TO HIM WAS PLEASURABLE RIGHT S GETTING PLEASURE THAT WAY HE'S GETTING PLEASURE AND HEALTHIER WAYS TAKING CARE OF HIMSELF DOING THE JOB HE LOVES DOING HIS LEISURE ACTIVITY LIKE THE MAN COMES INTO BALANCE AND THEN LIKE LIFE IS GOOD AND WE SAY E KE COME BACK IN TO COUPLE OF MNTHS AND COMES BACK IN TO COUPLE OF MONTHS AND MAYME IN SIX MONTHS COMES ACK L MORE TIME I WON'L SEE HIM AGAIN THAT'S GREAT HE TOLD HE DOESN'T NEED ME AGAIN AND I ATROPHED RANK FROM HIS LIE GREAT THAT'S THAT'S THE SUCCESS NATA EVENTUALLY ARRIVED AT BEING TRULY WEALTHY  WITH ALL T WITH ALL THE COMPONENTS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND PECE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT THE AS YOU DESCRIBE HIS STORY WHICH IS A REMARKABLE ONE UM IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THE NARRATIVES THAT WE HEAR AS CHILDREN AND A BEING SO POWERFUL YES UM AND I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT RECEIVE SUCH DIRECT MESSAGES FROM THEIR MOTHER AND OUR FATHER LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO THIS YOU CANNOT DO THAT BUT OFTEN WE GET MESSAGES THROUGH OBSERVING AND OVERHEARING RIGHT UM THE WAY THAT OUR MOTHER TALKS ABOUT OUR FATHER WHEN HE'S OUT OF THE ROOM THE WAY THAT OUR FATHER TALKS ABOUT OR MOTHER WHEN SHE'S OUT OF THE ROOM AND SOME OF THIS COULD BE NON VERBAL LIKE A ROLLING OF THE EYES OR A UM SOMEBODY SAYING YES YES A GREEING AND THEN THEY WALK OUT ON THES YOU KNOW AND COME BLOWING IN THEM OFF REAT HIM AN KIDS IR WE ARE ALL SO AWARE AND INTEGRATING ALL OF THAT ALL THE TIME AND I I DO THINK THOSE MESSAGES GET WOVEN INTO US AT A VERY DEEP LEVEL AND THEN OF COURSE THERE THE UNCONSCIOUS NARRATIVES THAT WE BUILD UP AS WE GO THROUGH IN PARTICULAR I THINK ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I CAN STILL REMEMBER I A NEGATIVE COMMENT SOMEBODY MADE ABOUT A JACKET THAT I WAS WEARING LIKE THE THIRD OF THE FOURTH GRADE I FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE TAT HAPPEN THAT YEAR REMEMBER THAT YEND I'M NOT UM YOU KNOW I'M NOT INSECURE ABOUT THE CLOTHING THAT I PICK YOU KNOW I'MAN OBVIOUSLY IT'S IT'S THE BLACK A BUTTON DOWN SHIRT I'VE HAD SIMILAR SHIRT SINCE THE FIRST GRATE JUST KIDTING UM BUT YOU KNOW THAT BUT WE THE FACT THAT THAT'S IMBEDDED IN MY MEMORY SYSTEMS IS LIKE JISHIT SPEAKS TO THE SALIENTS OF OF NEGATIVE E OF INSULTS BASELY WAS 'N ITSULT A AND I'M SURE I'VE INSULT TED PLENTY KIDS AN COMING UP YOU KNOW AS AT TO NATURE AND AND BACK AND FORTH AND AM AND SO BUT THESE NARRATIVES GET SO DEEPLY IMBEDED AND THE IDEA THAT ONE COULD PICK A DIFFERENT PATH OF VOCATION OR LIKE YOUR MISS THE OPPORTUNITY BE TRULY HAPPY AT A DEEP LEVEL BASED ON THESE NARRATIVES I MEAN ON ONE HAND IT'S OBVIOUS ON THE OTHER HAND YOU JUST GO LIKE WO THIS IT THIS IS NOT GOOD THIS IS THAT THIS IS A FLAW IN THE IN THE DESIGN IT A AND YET YOU'RE GIVING US A ROAD MAP TO TO UNDERSTANDING AND AND TO A'M OVERCOMING IT RIGHT LAS THAT WE TAKE YOU AT YOUR EXAMPLES WE WE THE GREAT EXAMPLES HAND WE WE LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THE THE PERSON MAKING FUN OF THE COTE IN THIRD GRATE RIGHT WERESUMING IT HASN'T HARMED YOU IT HASN'T CHANGE A COURSE OF YOUR LIFE RIGHT WHAT IS IT TELL US IT SHOWS THAT NEGATIVE SIMULI ARE VERY SALIENT RIGHT I'M SURE YOU GOT OT A COMPLIMENTS AND THIRD GREAT TOO RIGHT BUT IT'S THE NEGATIVE THAT STANDS OUT WE JUST SHOWS THAT THERE'S A SAILIENTS BIS IN US TOWARDS THE NEGATIVE AND THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT SURVIVAL AND THREAT SENSING LIKE IN SOME WAYS I MAKE SENSE AND AROUND HUMAN SURVIVAL BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AROUND HUMAN TRAMA RIGHT SO THEN SO YOU'DE GIVEN THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT GET'S COMMUNICATE TO THE CHILD WHEN SAY MOTHER SAYS SOMETHING NEGATIVE ABOUT FATHER WHEN FATHER'S OUT OF THE ROOM FATHER SAYS SOMETHING A NEGAT ABOUT MOTHER WHEN MOTHER'S OUT OFT ROM JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE RIGHT SO CHILDREN BECAUSE THE THE COMPLEX COGNITIVE MECHANISMS HAVEN'T BEEN FORMED YET RIGHT THEN THE NATURAL WAY THAT THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS IS IN A SELF REPARENTIAL WAY RIGHT SO SO THE CHILD GENERALLY DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SAY LIKE OH MAMAN DAT AREN'T WILL YOU GETTING ALONG WELL IN IN THIS CERTAIN WAY SO WHEN DASNOT HERE MAM VENTS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIM BY SAY HE CHILD ISN'T THINKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT THEN WHAT THE CHILD WILL OFTEN INTERNAL ISES IS OKAY THERE'S ME AND THERE'S MAMANDAD AND MOM SAYS DAD AS BAD AND DADS AS MAM IS BAD AND I MUST BE BAD TOO RIGHT BECAUSE IN GENERAL IF YOUR PARENTS ARE BAD THEN THEN THE CHILD TAKES THAT ON THEMSELVES NOW AGAIN ON GIVING AS SIMPLE EXAMPLE AT I'M VERY MUCH EXTRAPILATING GET I MEAN TO IMAG IF THAT WERE VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE WHERE THE MOTHER AS HAPPENS RIGHT JOS TELLS TO CHILD HOW AWFUL THE FATHER IS AND THE FATHER DOES THE SAME YOU YOU NOT AT SOME ONES LOK CON TO COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT BEING LIKE YOU KNOW WHAMAYBE THEY'RE BOTH AWFUL BUT I'M NOT THAT'S NOT HOW THAT GOES RIGHT SO THE LESSONS THE THE TRAMATIC LESSONS OF CHILDHOOD GET INTERNALISE RIGHT AND THEY DON'T EVEN ALWAYS HAVE A SOLUTION STAY SO SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MAN WHO KNEW LIKE GOOK  YOU HIVE TO GO GET THIS JOB AND LIKE ALL THOSE THINGS HE INTERNALISE YOU MIGHT SAY WELL I MEAN HE GOT TO A GOOD PLACE FOR HIM RIGHT SO SO FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE AT LEAST IT WAS A PLACE TO GO RIGHT TO TO GO GO WORKCART GO SUCCEED GO CHECK THIS BOX YOU'VE BEEN TOLD YOUR SUPPOSE TO CHECK BUT OFTENTIMES THERE IS NO SOLUTION STAY SO HOW MANY CHILDREN MEANS IS TERRIBLE THAT THIS IS SUCH A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE WORK ADON'T PRACTITIONERS DO IS IS HELPING PEOPLE WHO HAS CHILDREN WE'RE TOLD ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT THEY WERE WORTHLESS INCAPABLE UM BAD RIGHT THAT GETS THAT GETS PUT INTO THE CHILD UNFORTUNATELY FAR FAR IFIMING ONE TIME ON THE PLANET IS TOO FREQUENT LETTLE AND HOW LON OFTEN THIS HAPPENS UM THAT EXAMPLE MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE COULD WE HAN THIS IS A QUESTION COULD COULD WE ADD TO THAT THE EXAMPLE WHEREBY THE CHILD OVER HEARS A AN EXAMPLES OF WHAT SAY MEN SHOULD BE LIKE OR WOMEN SHOULD BE LIKE LIKE THE YOU THINGS T IT'S NOT SO MUCH A LIKE YOU DID WRONG ANDREW OR YOU KNOW YOU DID WRONG PAUL LIKE WOR OR TELLING A THE DAR LIKE IT YOU SCREWED UP BUT BUT IT'S MORE A AGAIN NARRATIVES THAT WE OVER HERE OR EVEN APPARENT A SHOWING A DELIGHT OR EXCITEMENT ABOUT A CERTAIN FINATYPE IN THE WORLD LIKE A WILE LOOK AT THAT PERSON OR LOOK AT THEM LIKE LIKE T ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL RIGHT THAT THE YOUNG CHILD THINKS LIKE OCABLE THAN THAT'S THE EPIDOMY OF BEAUTY THROUGH THE LENDS OF THE PARENT OR GOSH LIKE THIS PERSON IYOU KNOW LIKE THEN THAT THAT CHILD INTERNALIZES THAT THIS IS THE EPIDOMY OF DISGUST WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AND I THINK CHILDREN ARE SO SAVY I WITHOUT REALIZING IT AS TY LIKE OK WILL THEN I GUESS YOU YOU MOVE TOWARD THAT AND YET AND YOU ASPIRE TO THAT AND YOU DEFLECT FROM THAT AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THESE TRAJECTORIES CAN BE SET VERY EARLY ON I MEAN THAT THESE ARE THE THESE ARE THE FORELANE HIGHWAYS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT AN EPISODE ONE WEARE JUST ROUTS OF NURRAL PROCESSING THAT CAN BRING US TO PUT CHOICES IN LIFE AND PLACES IN LIFES THAT OFTENTIMES YEEL LIKE I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THIS PATH ANY MORE AND AND SO THAT THE EXPLORATION OF OF EARLY NARRATIVES BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECTING A FIRST PERSON AND THIRD PERSON SEEM SO CRITICAL  HOW HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT THAT I MEAN CLEARLY WITH A TRAINCLINATION LIKE YOU I YOU WOULD GUIDE SOMEBODY THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT IF SOMEWADY WORD TO TRY AND DO THIS AND SOME SORT OF STRUCTURED WAY FOR THEMSELVES AN WHAT O THOSE LINES OF INQUIRY LOOK LIKE BECAUSE WE HAVE VAST NUMBER OF EXPERIENCES FROM CHILDHOOD BUT SOME MESSAGES ARE GOING TO BE MORE SALIENT THAN ASUR HY THAT REFLECT IT SELF SCRUTINY YOU CAN HELP US I THINK ITS IS A GREAT IDEA IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT AND AND WE WE DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO TY INSIDE AND WERE GUIDED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS INSIDE BUT THIS I THINK  SHOULD OVERSHADOW MANY IF NOT MOST OF ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS OF IKE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON INSIDE OF ME BECAUS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL COME THROUGH THAT AND DON'T LEARN RIHTS WH PERSON IS TOLD LIKE THIS IS WHAT BEAUTIFUL IS THIS IS WHAT SUCCESSFUL IS THIS IS WHAT GOOD ENOUGH LOOKS LIKE RIHT AND AND THAT PERSON MAY THROUGH ALL SORTS OF EXPERIENCES THER MAY BE OTHER PEOPLE IN THEIR LIVES WHO ARE MORE BALANCE BE ELBO ARRIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE AN THAT EVEN STILL SOMETIMES GOING THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT DEPENDING UPON AGE AND SITUATION AND KNOWING KA LIKE THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW MIH MY FATHER MOTHER THINKS LIKE THIS WHAT BEAUTY IS THIS IS WHAT SUCCESSES BUT IT'S ONE SET OF OPINIONS AND ES NOT A SET OF OPINIONS THAT ARE GOIN TO TO FINE MAY LIKE SOMETHIMES PEOPLE GET TO THAT PLACE BUT A LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T AND THEY CARRY THAT LESSON FORWARD AND THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF IT RIGHT SO THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY UNATTRACTIVE EVEN THOUGH OTHER PEOPLE RE GIVING THEM DIFFERENT SIGNALS THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY DUMB EVEN THOUGH OTHER PEOPLE ARE GIVING THEM DIFFERENT SIGNALS IN THEIR OWN GRADS AND THEIR OWN SUCCESS MAYBE GIVING THEM DIFFERENT SIGNALS RIGHT BUT THEY'RE NOT PUTTING THE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND THAT'S GIN A GENERATE TENSION RIGHT THAT MIGHT BE WHY THAT PERSON DOESN'T FOLLOW UP ON PETENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT THEY JUST DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH IN THE PERSONS VENTURICAN REJECT THEM BECAUSE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE RIGHT THEY  TAKING THAT WITH THEM IN THIS IN THIS EXAMPLE FROM I OLD DO RIGHT ORDTHER THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE JOB THAT IN OTHER WAYS IS LIKE REALLY GREAT RIGHT THEY THEY ENJOY THE WORK THEN GUR THY BUT DOESN'T PAY ENOUGH RIGHT WHY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME FALSE IDEA INSIDE OF WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO PAY RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT THE PARENTS SAID SO WAS BY SELF SCREWTINY LIKE WHAT ARE THE GIVENS AND I ALWAYS THINK THEY CO GOES BACK TO THE MATHMINER RIGHT IF YOU CAN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE GIVENTS RIGHT WHAT ARE YOU TAKING FOR GRANTED LIKE AL I KNOW THAT EVERY TIME I SEE AND NACT TATEX EQUALS FOR  REALLY MAYBE IN IT MAY BE WROTE DOWN FOR SOMEHOW BECAUSE YOU ARE THINKING OF FOR AT THE TIME AND EXACTLY IS A THREE RIHCELY JUST GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE TAKING FOR FOR GRANTED RIGHT IN A LOT THAN TIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE TERAPBY PROCESS AND HAN THAT'S WHEN THE PERSON CAN REALIZED O I'M SIMPLIFYING BUT FOR THE PERSON TO REALIZE LIKE OH THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD SO TO SPEAK IS A NATURAL VOICE THAT IS THE VOICE OF THIS PERSON RIGHT WHO WHO MAY NOT EVEN BE AROUND ANY MORE WHOSE OPINION DOESN'T MEAN AS TO ME WHAT IT DID BEFORE BUT THAT VOICE IS SAYING YOU'RE UNATTRACTIVE YOU'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH MONEY YOURE NOT GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT AND YOU KNOW IT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT RIGHT I DON'T THINK IT IDENTIFY THAT AND THEN YOU CAN THET DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE BUT YOU CAN GET IT OUT OF YOU BE GENERALLY DON'T GET IT OUT OF YOU UNLESS YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S THERE WHAT IS THE PROCE SS OF GETTING IT OUT IM BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE ALL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REMEMBER CERTAIN THINGS AND AND TO ARRIVE AT A PLACE WHERE WE CAN I'M UNDERSTAND O KAY I'M I'M TAKING FOR GRANTED THE FACT THAT THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD THAT SAYS BLANK I SEY I HAVE A BRIEF ANITO TO SAY ABOUT THIS IN THIS ISN'T THAT THE CONT  I HAVE A FRIEND THING THAT I LITERALLY HAVE A A A A FEMALE FRIEND WO THE OTHER DAY CALLE ME LAUGHING AND CRYING BECAUSE IM SHE'S BEENG AVICTED FROM HER HER APARTMENT AND SHE TOLD HER MOTHER ABOUT THIS OVER THE PHONE AND HER MOTHER'S RESPONSE WAS WELL AT LEAST YOU'RE THIN WHI LIKE T LEKEIT LIKE ND AND AND SHE WAS LAUGHING AND CRYING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT REFLECTED SO MUCH OF HER CHILDHOOD RIGHT RIGHT THEY LIVE NO OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HAVING A JOB HAVING APARTMENT ET CETERA LIKE YOU DON'T MATTERED IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS ABOUT ONE THING IT WAS ABOUT AS AA CERTAIN FORM OF AECETIC BEAUTY THAT I'M NOT EVEN SURE SHE SUBSCRIBES TO YOU KNOW SHE HAPPENS TO BE THIN RIGHT SO SO THE FACKE THEIR MOTHER WOULD WOULD LIFT THAT FROM THAT THE CONVERSATION THERE'S SUCH A  A DEPRIVATION OF OF OF SO MANY THINGS IN THAT IN THAT INTERACTION BUT BUT IT REALLY WASN'T ABOUT THAT INTERACTION IT WAS YOU KNOW THAT SHE WAS CALLING ME BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY ABOUT HER ENTIRE CHILDHOOD RIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT EQUIPPED TO DISSOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT IT WASN'T A REQUEST FOR MONEY OR ANYTHING ON THAT SORT IT WAS JUST WAS ALMOST LIKE THE THE HILARITY AND THE I'M AND THAT THE SADNESS OF THE WHOLE PICTURE RIGHT BUT AGAIN IT'S PEAKS TO T THESE NARRATIVES THAT WE INTERNALIZING THAT SOMETIMES SHOW UP IN IN VERY GLARING WAYS IN THE REAL WORLDS LIKE TO HEAR THAT I THINK WAS SHOCKING TO HER I THNK SHE NEEDED TO TELL ME TO LIKE IT LIKE AS THIS REAL BUT THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT THAT MESSAGE IT EXISTED IN HER HEAD FOR A LONG TIME ANYWAY IM THAT COAN BE VERY PIVITAL IF SHE REALIZES THAT RIGHT AND EVEN THE POWER OF THE HUMOR OF A THIS IS ABSURD RIGHT THAT COAN BE VERY POWERFUL IN IN CREATING CHANGE  THERE SOME VESTIGE OF THAT INSIDE OF HER RIGHT WERE LIKE SHE STILL B LEAVUES LIKE GO'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE I ACHIEVED ABY AND SEE BUT I DON'T LOOK LIKE ACT SHATEVER IT CAN AVERY MUCH OUT AS ERE'S A LOT OF POWER BEHIND REALIZING THAT ABSURDITY IF I GO MY THAT'S BAZARR LIKE SO BUT BUT WAT IS ANY THAT INSIDE OF ME AM I CARRYING SOME OF THAT WITH ME I'M ISN'T INCENTIVE FOR SELF SCRUTINY AND IT YOU THREW WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING CAUSE WHAT WHAT'S THE IDEAL AMOUNT OF THAT TO STILL BE IN HER ZERO SO IS AS ONE COMES TO REALIZE THE MESSAGES THEY'VE HEARD OR PERHAPS LIKE IN THIS CASE THAT THEY'RE STILL HEARING IS THE PROCESS OF OVERCOMING THOSE MESSAGES ANE REALLY ARRIVING AT THE SELF IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE ITS A TWO PART PROCESS AT LEAST TWO PART PROCESS ITS TO LOOK IN THE BEN OF WHAT ARE THE GIVENS WHATAE WHAT ARE WHAT AM I TAKING FOR GRANTED ABOUT THE INTERNAL NARRATIVES AND THINK ABOUT THEIR ORIGINS IN CHILDHOOD OR ELSEWHERE BUT THEN ALSO CULTIVATING THE SELF AWAREINESS PIECE THAT'S UNDER THE FUNCTION OF SELF LIKE WAI WHAT'S REALLY TRUE FOR ME AT THE LEVEL OF ME TH'S THAT THAT ISN'T THE AND THIS IS REALLY I THINK ABOUT SEPARATING OUT THE VOICES IN ONES HAD THESE INTERNALIZED NARRATIVES FROM THE PERSON THAT WE REALLY TRULY ARE BECAUSE THE IDEAS THAT THOSE TWO PILLARS AND ENCOMPASS EVERYTHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT RIGHT THAT THOSE THOSE TEN CUPBOARDS IN COMPASS EVERYTHING SO IT'S ALL THAT RIGHT THE PERSON WHOSE GOING AND LOOKING T THE GIVENS THEY'RE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MIGHT BE IN MY UNCONSCIOUS MIND THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF RIGHT AND  WELL THE YOU KNOW THE LAST TIME I GOT THIS BIG OF WORD AT WORK I THIS REFLECTS OF THOUGHT  LIKE BUT YOU'RE NOT THIN ENOUGH WELL WO RIGHT LIKE THERE COULD BE A PROCESS LIKE THAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF ME I DON'T WANT THAT GOING ON INSIDE OF ME RIGHT SO THE PROCOF TRY WHAT IS UNCONSCIOUS IN US THAT MAY BE CAUSING US HARM WHICH IS OFTEN WHERE THE THAT'S WHERE THE TROMA GOES RIGHT IT'S WAY IS WHERE THE CHILDHOOD TROMA SEATS ITSELF WHICH BRINGS US BACK AROUND TO THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS RIGHT INTRUSIVE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS AND NEGATIVE SELF DIALOGUE USUALLY DOES NOT MEAN WHAT IT MEANT TO THE MAN WHO NEED TO CHANGE JOBS RIGHT BECAUSE ECAUSE THERE THEY WERE THERE FOR GOOD REASON RIGHT THEN YO NEEDED TO MAKE CHANGE MORE OFTEN THERE THE THE THE VESTIGES THE HANG OVER THE LINGERING BADNESS OF SOME PRIOR TRAMA SO OFTEN TIMES WHEN YOU THINK  WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY ABOUT THE PERSON WHO WAS DRIVING IN THE CAR AN JUST TOLLING THEMSELVES OVER AND OVER THAT THEY WERE THAT THEYRE LOSER RIGHT AND THEN THEY THEY CAN'T ACHIEVE THE THINGS THAT THEY ACHIEVED WHEN THEY STOPPED TO DOING THAT I'M SIMPLIFYING A LITTLE BUT THAT'S THE BASICS OF IT RIGT BECAUSE THE THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHT'S THE SELF NARATIVE ALL THE NEGATIVITY IN US IS OFTEN COMING FROM PLACES THAT ARE IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT NOT ALWAYS BUT THIS IDEA THAT I DON'T THINK I'M GOOD ENOUGH IOM SAYING TO MYSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN LIKE WHILE LET'S GO BACK AND LOOK AT WI BECAUSE THE ANSWER TO THAT AND LIES IN A DIFFERENT PLACE AS JUST A DIFFERENT ROAD MAP RIGHT THE MEN WHO NEEDED TO CHANGE JOBS HAD A ROAD MAP THAT LIKE SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN THE I SELF AWARENESS IND THAN A KIND OF THAN IT WENT THROUGH SELF TO A DEFENCE MECHANISMS AN ACTION LAND AND IT SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH BEHAVIOR AND THEN IT GOT UP TO THE STRIVINGS THAT'S HIS THAT'S HIS ROAD MAP WHERE AS FOR SOME ONE WHOSE LABORING UNDER THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THE NEGATIVE SELF TALK THE AUTOMATICITY THE GIVENS OF THILDHOOD TRAMA THAN NEEDS TO GO TO A DIFFERENT PLACE WHEN OW WE'RE SPENDING TIME WITH IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S THERE FIGERING OUT WHAT'S THEIR BRINGING THINGS TO CONSCIOUSNESS RIGHT THAT PERSON SAY REALIZING MAYBE YOU KNOW YOUR FRIEND YOU HAD THIS REALIZATION OF LIKE ALL MY GOODNESS WE S A WOT TO THAT BRING SOMETHING TO THE CONSCIOUS MIND IN HER IF SO GREAT LET'S LOOK AT THAT AND LET'S LOOK A LOT AT IT AND LET'S LOOK A THEIR OTHER THINGS THERE TOO RIGHT ARE THER OTHER GIVENS RIGHT LET'S BRING THEM THE CONSCIOUS TO CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THEM WE CAN IDENTIFY THEM AND THEN LOOK AT HOW DOES THAT HOW DOS THAT RELATE TO DEFENSE MECHANISM IN CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND LIKE NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING A A PROCESS OF OF INTERESTED INQUIRY LIKE THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING A ME SHOULD BE INTERESTING TO THE PERSON DOING IT IT'S THEM RIGHT AND IT SHOULD BE INTERESTING TO THE PERSON DOING IT WITH THEM RIGHT AS IF YOU'RE ATHERAPIST IT IS NOT INTERESTING TO YOU NEED ANOTHER JOB RIGHT SO' YORE TALKING TO A FRIEND THAT IF ITS A FRIEND IS GOING TO BE INTERESTED SO THERE'S AN INTERESTED HONEST OPEN INQUIRY WITH THE IDEA OF HOMIC WEEN LET'S LEARN THINGS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AND EVEN THOSE WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND THE SELF DIALOGUE THAT'S GONE ON OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT DOESN'T GO AWAY EASILY BUT THAT DOESNIT MEAN IT DOESN'T ATROPHY OVER TIME AND GO AWAY OR THAT THE PERSON CAN HAVE THAT REFLECTIVE THOUGHT LIKE OH THERE'S THE THOUGHT AGAIN THAT I'M A LOSER OR THAT I SHOULD CUT MYSELF FOR I SHOULD DRINK OR WHATEVER IT IS LIKE I KNOW THAT THOUGHT APPEARS IN ME AUTOMATICALLY AT TIMES BECAUSE IT WAS IN MY HEAD FOR SO LONG BUT IT DOES NOT TELLING ME ANYTHING  IT IS AN AUTOMATIC THOUGHT THAT THING I SHOULD DRINGS AT TO ME ANYTHING RIGHT OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT LIKE O THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN HUMAN BEINGS LIKE THAT'S HOW THE SELF UNDERSTANDING BRINGS CHANGE IN US AND GETS US OVER THE BARRIERS IF I'VE BEEN TRYING THIS FOR AN WHAT MODERN MENTAL HEALTH A OT THEM TOS THINK I I TOOK THE SELECTS THAT I DID THE TEN SESSIONS OF SEVY TEELIK LIKE YOU KNOW I'M A FAILURE NOTHING WILL EVER GET BETTER YOU KNOW A DIFFERENT FRAMING THAT'S A DAY LIKE THIS CAN GET BETTER OVER TIME IN MY UNDERSTANDING IN MY EFFORTS MY THOUGHT REDIRECTION MY BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES ALL MAKES IT BETTER THAN THOSE THINGS I DON'T WANT IN MY HEAD THEY'RE GOING AWAY IT'S TAKEN TIME BUT THEY'RE GOING AWAY I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT ONE CAN HAVE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND THAT ONE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THOSE IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AND LOOK AT THEM AND NOT TRY AND PUSH THEM BACK DEEPER  YOU DON'T NOT TRYING TO RADICATE THEM I'M I'M FAMILIAR WITH HAVING INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS NOT ALL THE TIME BUT IT VERYS PERTS THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND I'M THE IDEA THAT ONE CAN JUST EXTINGUISH THEM AS IS A GREAT IDEA BUT THATS SIMPLY NOT THE WAY IT'S WORKED AT LEAST NOT FOR ME BUT I HAVE FOUND THAT IF I YOU'LL JUST OKAT THIS IS SPONTANEOUSLY COMING UP THROUGH THE NORL CIRCUITS OF MY SUBCONSCIENCE AND IND THEY'RE INTRUSIVE AND I DON'T LIKE THEM BUT I EVENTUALLY ARRIVE AT EXACTLY THE PLACE THAT YOU DESCRIBE WHICH IS THAT LIKE THERE'S NOTHING ACTIONABLE HERE LIKE IT'S JUST THEY GO FROM BEING U INTRUSIVE AND AND TROUBLING TO INTRUSIVE AND JUST KIND OF MILDLY IRRITATING TO INTRUSIVE AND LIKE OK YNOW II JUST OM A YOU KOW AN YESS I I GO THROUGH SOME REDIRECT LIKE TRYING REDIRECT MY ATTENTION FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN THEY'RE HAPPENING BUT I VENTUALLY JUST GET TO A PLACE WHERE IT LIKE O CASE JUST A BORING STORY OR OR OR BORING IMATERY THERE' THERE'S NOTHING THERE THERE'S OTHING THERE AND THEN AN THE THEY EVENTUALLY BREAK UP LIKE LIKE CLOUDS VE NOT ANT PROGIS TATING A WHILE BUT RIGHT OMS YOU TOOK THE ENERGY OUT OF THEM R YOU MADE THEM GO AWAY WHICH HAPPENED OVER TIME AND THAN THE ENERGY THAT WAS SO POWAB TOMS LESS AND LESS NLESS AND WHAT HAPPENS THEY DISSIPATE E ATROPHY AY THAT'S HOW THEY GO AWAY BECAUSE HERE'S NO MORE POWER THERE'S NO MORE POWER AN THET AND AND THAT REALLY IS THE WAY THAT WE MAKE CHANGE AND I THINK YOU KNOW YOUR EMPHASIS UPON THE FACT THAT IT TAKES TIME THE FACT THAT IT TAKES EFFORT THE FACT THAT IT ONLY GOES AWAY SLOWLY OVER TWENTY YEARS OF OF AT TIMES BEING A THERAPIST WHAT I'VE SEEN BE THE MOST DAUNTING THE THING THAT MAKES PEOPLE JUST GIVE UP AND GO AWAY AND GO BACK TO THE THINGS AT VERY BAD YOU'VE UP ON THEMSELVES OR THAT IT TAKES TIME AND YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE TWO WEEKS AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU'SE KIND OF LEADING YOU TO THINK THAT AND THEN YOU GO FOR HELP AND THE HELP KIND OF LEADS YOU TO THINK THAT WHETHER IT'S TWO WEEKS OR ITS TEN WEEKS IF IT'S GOING TO TAKE TWO YEARS YOU'EGING TO GO AWAY DISHEARTENED RY ORMAY BE MORE ANGRY AT YOURSELF  MAY BE DEMORALIZE SO WE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE TRUTH OF ALL THIS I TI PARALLEL TO YOUR STORY IN MY OWN LIFE FOR FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS I CARRIED A NEGATIVE VOICE INSIDE THERE'S ALWAYS WAITING FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING WRONG SO IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OFFER NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY NOW IT WOULD SAY LIKE THAT WASN'T GOOD OAUS SS SOMETHING NEGATIVE INSIDE TO ME ORE IT'S WAITING FOR M TO DROP SOMETHING AND SAY THI'M STUPID AND CLUMSY I WITH ME ALL THE TIME BUT OVER TIME THROUGH SELF REFLECTION THROUGH THERIPY LIKE THROUGH A LOT OF HARD WORK BUT A DESIRE FOR THINGS TO BE BETTER AND A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND IT I IT'S NOT THERE ANY MORE I MAD EVERY NOW AND THEN IT'LL RAISE ITS HEAD RIGHT I'LL I'LL DO SOMETHING REALLY I DROP TO CUP OF COFFEE HAVEN'T DONE IN TEN YEARS AND IT MADE A MEDICE AND NOW PEOPLE OF COMING TO CLEAN IT UP AND MAND THE VOICE CAME BACK RIGHT BUT I COULD RECOGNIZE IT I LIKE I REALLY FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS AND NOW IT GIVES THAT VOICE A CHANCE TO COME OUT BUT IT DOESN'T COME OUT MUCH ANY MORE WERETWAY I LIVED WITH IT FOR YEARS IT DOESN'T COME OUT WITE MUCH ANY MORE AND WHEN IT CAME OUT NOT THAT LONG AGO I I COULD RECOGNIZE LIKE I'M NOT HAPPY I DID THIS OF  ME HOPE CLEAN IT UP BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M AN IDIOT RIGHT SO SO THE VOICE IN MY HEAD CON JUST GO AWAYS IT'S AS AS IV BEEN HELPING IT TO DO FOR WUNCH A YEARS NOW YET I THINK ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTANDS THAT IT TAKES TIME BUT THAT WE CAN ALL POTENTIALLY ENGAGE IN RIGHT ACTIONS YOU KNOW MOVING TOWARDS STRIVINGS AND HOPEFULNESS AS WE COPE WITH THOSE AND TRYING TIMINISH THOSE INTERNAL NARRATIVES THOSE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS IT'S NOT AS IF DURING THE ENTIRE PROCESS YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T FUNCTION I MAN I THINK THAT THE A IT'S A COGNIVELY AND SOMETIMES EVEN PHYSICALLY DEMANDING TO DO BUT WE CAN STILL ENGAGE IN HEALTHY WAYS AND IN THE WORLD AND WE CAN I'M STILL TRYING A AVOID ACTING OUT AND AN AVOID UM FORMS OF DENIAL AND AND AS I SAY THIS I'M REALIZING THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE WISH FOR OR THE IMPULSE TO REALLY JUST SUPPRESS INTRUSIVE THOUGHT BORN OF TRAMA OR WHATEVER ELSE IT I'S REALLY FUTILE IT DOES NOT CON Y WITES IS NOT IN A WORK WE HAVE TO EMBRACE THESE NARRATIVES AND AND NOT EXPECT THEM TO DISAPPEAR IN A FINGER SNAP BUT BUT EMBRACE THEM AND LIKE SEE THEM AND LOOK AT THEM AND AND AND BE UNAFRAID TO LOOK AT THEM AND UM DISCOUNT WHERE THEY ARE ABSOLUTLY NOT TRUE UM I WULD SAY UNAFRAID TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT BECAUSE WE NUST UNDERSTAND MEANS WE MUST LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US WHEN I DIDN'T LIKE THAT VOICE BUT WAS AFRAID OF IT LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE ME WHAT IS TO SAY ABOUT ME AND I AND I'M DIRECTING AWAY FROM IT WHILE THAT'S WHY IT WAS WITH ME FIKE SEVERAL DECADES RIGHT BUT WHEN I START TO GO LOOK AT IT I CAN FIND AN ANSWER TO IT AND IT IYOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT PERSON BECAUSE ONE MIGHT PRESUME AND MAYBE PEOPLE LISTENING ARE PRESUMING THIS OR MAYME NOT BUT BUT E BUT A REASONABLE PRESUMPTION THAT MYT IS REFLECTIVELY HAPPEND IN A PERSON WOULD BE TO THINK THAT OH WHEN I WAS YOUNGER THE MESSAGING I WAS GETTING WAS IT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH WRIGHTE THAT'S WHY I CARRY WITH ME THAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT BUT'S NOT THAT SOMETIMES IT'S THE OPPOSITE THAT I WAS REWARDED A LOT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER FOR DOING THINGS IN AWAY EVERYONE THOUGHT WAS GREAT RIGHT LIKE GETTING GREAT GRADES AND BEING WELL BEHAVED NEW DOING ALL SO TO THINGS THAT BROUGHT A LOT A POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT TO ME BUT I NEVER HANDLED WELL THINGS IT FELL EVEN A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF THAT AND THEN IT WOULD EVOKE A LOT OF SHAME SO SO THE OPPRESSION INSIDE IS NOT COMING FROM DENEGRATION IS COMING FROM SOMETHING DIFFERENT RGHT WHICH IS WHICH IS ALSO WHY THIS IS NOT A SEARCH TO BLAME SOME ONE RIGHT BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING THE MESSAGE LIKE THEIR DOING THE BEST THEY CAN MEAN SOME ONE WHO SAYING TO A CHILD YOU'RE LOSER LIKE THAT'S NOT OQT RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT THAT'S NOT OQT BUT BUT THAT'S OFTED NOT HOW IT HAPPENS I CAN THAT THE PARENTLYUS IS COMMUNICATING THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT TTHAT EVERY TIME THEY'RE ADMIRING A CERTAIN LOVEL OF WEALTH FOR A CERTAIN KIND OF BEAUTY THOUR GIVING THAT MESSAGE THAT THE CHILD THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAT THAT OR ISNIT ENDS UP NOT MEATING THAT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT OR YOU KNOW ID LIKE MY MY PARENTS TRI TO NURTURE ME AND THE DID A GOOD JOB OF IT IN MANY WAYS AND TEACHERS DID A GOOD JOBUT SO THEY THEYD  REALIZING  THIS PERSONS CAN END UP YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF YEARS FOR NOW NOT THINKING ANYTHINGS GET A GOOD ENOUGH AND EV THEY DON'T KNOW THAT SO IT'S NOT A SEARCH FOR BLAME AND I THINK THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT  VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OFTEN PEOPLE DON'T WANT A LOOK INSIDE BECAUSE THEY THINK EITHER I'M GOING O FINE SOMETHING DRAMATICALLY WRONG WITH ME AND THE ANSWER I WOULD GIVE IS THERE'S ALMOST SURELY NOT SOMETHING DRAMATICALLY LONG WITH YOU IF YOU'RE HAVING THAT THOUGHT AND IF SOMEHOW THERE IS YOU'RE BETTER OFF LOOKING AT IT NOW THAN LATER RIGHT AND SO THAT'S PART OF IT THE OTHER PART IS THAT THAT PEOPLE BECOME WORRY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RUIN SOMETHING YOU KNOWN AN I LIKE MY PARENTS AND IF I GO LOOK AT THIS I'M GOOTED I'M GOO I'M GOING TO HATE THEM AN LIKE PEOPLE SAY SATHING TO THINK THINGS LIKE THAT AND THE IDEA THAT WE MAY GET DOWN TO SOMETHING THAT REALLY INVOLVE SOMEONE BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING BAD NOW THAT'S IF THAT'S THE TRUTH THE PERSONALRITY KNOWS THAT INSIDE THE VAST MAJORITY OF TIMES THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT FACING THAT BUT MOST OF THE TIME ALSO IT'S NOT THAT IS JUST LIKE COOKGAT THAT'S HOW LIFE EVOVED AND WHAT'S A PREDISPOSITION LIKE YOU KNOW I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO GET GOOD GRADES AND I HAVE A LOW THRESHOLD FOR SHAME AND PEOPLE REENFORCE ME AND AND LIKE AIK I CAN CANNOT UNDERSTAND THAT SO THEN I CAN GET CONTROL OVER IT IT'S NOT A SEARCH FOR ANGR FUSTRATION BLAME OF SELF OR OTHERS YE AN OFTENTIMES I I HEAR THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF UM DEALING WITH THESE DEEPER ISSUES ORE ADDRESSING THESE DEEPER ISSUES FOR FEAR THAT THEY'LL LOSE SAY THEYRE THEY'RE DRIVE RIGHT THAT THE THING THAT MAKES THEM SUCCESSFUL IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT ALLOWS THEM A PERHAPS EVEN TO AFFORD THERAPEOR AFFORD THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DRIVES THAT YOU REFER TO EARLIER THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IN THE PLEASURE DRIVE ARE SUCH CRITICAL NODES ER AIRY US TO LOOK FOR ALL OF US IN TERMS OF F YOU'RE NOT WHETHEROR NOT WE'RE DOING WELL OR LESS WELL ACCORDING TO SOME FEATURES THAT ARE PRETTY MUCH UNIVERSAL IN PEOPLE S I' SUALY WHAT I'M SAYING IS I'M AT LEAST BY MY UNDERSTANDING WE ALL HAE VE DRIVES TO SOME EXTENT OR ANOTHER AND TO E EXTENT THAT OUR AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS VERY HIGH AND PLEASURE DRIVE IS VERY HIGH AND BUTHE NOT IT'S POINTED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT CAN BE GENERATIVE IF IT'S NOT PERHAPS IT CAN UNDERMINE OUR GENERATOR DRIVE I VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW YOU'VE OBSERVED THE DIFFERENT O RANGES OF THESE DRIVES AND PEOPLE AND HOW THAT PREDICTS WEATHER OR NOT PEOPLE WILL DO OM MORE OR LESS WELL IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF LIFE SONCTUALLY HOW THE DIFFEN DRIVES PLAY OUT THINK THAT THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS WHERE THE DRIVES ARE AT SO TO SPEAK IN IN ANY OF US IS A COMBINATION OF NATURE AND NURTURE SO N THE NATURE PART TELLS US THE RANGE SO THAT THE DRIVE IS GOING TO BE BUT BECAUSE NURTURE MEANS SO MUCH TO HUMANS AS AS WE UNDERSTANDI FROM EPIGENETICS FROM FROM THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE WE SEE MORE AND MORE AND MORE HOW MUCH NURTURE MATTERS SO THE RANGE THAT'S DENOTED BY NATURE IS PROBABLY PRETTY BROAD WHEN WE WE SEE THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT AND THAT THE NURTURE LETS US THEN MOVE THAT DRIVE NOW SOMETIMES NURTURE THAT'S NOT GONE IN THE RIGHT PLACE CAN MOVE THE DRIVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION I BUT AS AS ADULTS AS PEOPLE WHO CAND TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES WHO CAN LEARN ABOUT OURSELVES WE CAN CHANGE WHERE THE DRIVES ARE SEATED IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A LOT OF CHANGES OF SELF OF SELF KNOWLEDGE AND HARD WORK AND BUT WE CAN DO IT WE CAN CHANGE THE THE SORT OF ARRAY OF HOW THOSE DRIVES ARE MANIFESTING THEMSELVES WITHIN US AND WE SEE THAT AND TAT'S PART OF THE HOPEFULNESS OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT MIT THAT WE SEE NOT JUST SURFACE CHANGES BUT WE CAN SEE CHANGES ON A DEEPER LEVEL SO ANIN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE THINGS ARE NOT FIXED ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME NATURAL ELEMENT OU KNOF SOME ONE WHO MAY HAVE A NATURAL SO OF LOW AGGRESSION OR LOW SELF ASSERTION A CASE CAN BE IN THE LOWER RANGE BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S LOCKED IN IT ANY ONE PARTICULAR POINT AND THAT THE PLACE THAT WE WANT TO BE WHAT IS THE PLACE THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE TH NGS THAT WE WANT THE THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS VERBS AND THE A THE SENSE OF WELL BEING AND ALL THAT SO THE THE IDEA IS THE STATE OF HEALTH AS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AS AS PROMINENT THATS ITS THE DOMINANT DRIVE AND THEN AGGRESSION AND PLEASURE WHICH IS STILL ACTIVE IN US BUT THEIR SUBSERVING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THAT'S THE STATE THAT WE WISH TO BE IN SO WHEN WE'RE ASESSING LOOKA WHY WHY S ER SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T FEEL O CAOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING OQU T THAN ONE WAY TO START IT IS TO LOOK AT OCATE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PERSON WHAT MAY BE OFF IN THE DRIVES THAT GIVES US A VERY STRONG IDEA OF OKA WHAT'S GOING ON AWAY OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON AS WE THEN GO AND LOOK IN THE TEN CUPBOARDS TO FIGURE OUT THE SPECIFIC LOOKAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON HERE THAT WE CAN THEN CHANGE BUT THE FRAMING OF WHAT'S GOING ON CAN COME THROUGH THE LENS OF LOOKING AT THE DRIVES AND HOW THEIR MANIFEST IN US WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WHEN THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS VERY HIGH AND THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS ALSO VERY HIGH SO IF THESE DRIVES ARE RUNNING TOO HIGH WHERE WE END UP AT IS IN A PLACE OF ENVY AN AN ENVY I AMOYS OR ON THE SOAP BOX ABOUT ENVY BECAUSE I THINK ENVY IS JUST SO WILDLY DESTRUCTIVE AND IF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS VERY HIGH SO THE PERSON SAY IN IN ONE WAY OF A ONE WAYS CAN MANIFEST ITSELF IS WANCE MORE AND MORE AND MORE A DOR NOT GETTING SATISFACTION FROM ANYTHING BUT THEY WANT MORE THAT MAY BE BECAUSE OF A STRONG VUNERABILITY INSIDE OF THEM SO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT MAP TO TO NARCICISM FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S  THERE COULD BE A STRONG AGGRESSIVE DRIVE TO GET MORE AND THAT LEADS TO SOMETHING THIT'S VERY UNHEALTHY SO THE IDEA THAT I WANT MORE I NEED MORE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH I CAN'T GET ENOUGH THAN FOSTER IS ENVY ITWHICH IS THE THE NOT THE DESIRE TO BE BETTER OR TO HAVE MORE BUT IT'S JUST THE DESIRE TO FEEL BETTER A OL THE SELF WHETHER THAT INVOLVES RAISING THE SELF UP OR BRINGING SOMEONE ELSE DOWN AS WHY ENVY IS DESTRUCTIVE SO VERY HIGH LEVELS OF AGGRESSION THAT ARE NOT TEMPERED FOR EXAMPLE BY A GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT THAT WOULD ALSO BE HIVE THAN CREATI CIRCUMSTANCE OF ENVY AND THE ENVY IS DESTRUCTIVE AND THE SAME HAPPENS IF THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS VERY VERY STRONG SO SO IF ONE CONTINUES TO WANT MORE PLEASURE SO I CAN'T FIND ANY SATISFACTION I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF I FEEL BERIFT IND SIDE RIGHT AND AND I SEE THAT A PLEASURE CAN MAKE ME FEEL BETTER BUT JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT RIGHT THAN IT FADES AWAY AND I WANT MORE OF IT I WANT MORE OF IT THAT ALSO CAN LEAD TO THE PLACE OF ENVY LIKE THAT'S THE OUTCOME SO IF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS RUNNING VERY HIGH OR THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS RUNNING VERY HIGH OR IF BOTH ARE RINNING VERY HIGH BUT IT ONLY TAKES WANE IT IN ORDER TO END UP IN A PLACE OF ENVY SO IF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO OVERCOME HOW HIGH THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS WHICH WOULD MEAN THAN THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE WOULD BE SUBLIMATED TOWARDS GOOD PRODUCTIVE THINGS WHO TAKE THE ENERGY AND PUT IT TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT IS GOODNESS BUT IF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS WAS WAY OUT THEIR HEAD OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT ENDS UP IN A PLACE OF ENVY AS DOES THE PLEASURE DRIVE IF I WANT MORE AND MORE AND MORE BUT I NEVER GET SATISFACTION FROM FROM ANYTHING IT NEVER BRINGS ME ANY SENSE OF GOODNESS THAT WHERE IT ENDS IS IN A PLACE OF OF VONABILITY AND RESENTMENT RIGTAS ENVY INVOLVES WANTING MORE RIGHT  AND AND ENVY IF WE LOOK AT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON ENVY UNDER THE SURFACE INVOLVES WANTING EVERYTHING RIGHT IF IF A PERSON IS AT THE OUTER LIMITS OF ENVY RIGHT WHICH IS WHY ENVY IS SO DESTRUCTIVE BECAUSE IF I CAN'T GET ENOUGH PLEASURE AND THERE'S SO MUCH AGGRESSION IN ME THAND I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL BETTER BUT WHAT I CENDO IS MAKE OTHER PEOPLE FEEL WORSE I WAN'T ASK YOU MORE ABOUT ENVY BUT FIRST I WANT TO ASK IS ONE WAY TO CHARACTERIZE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE OTHER DRIVES IS TO SAY THAT GENERATIVE DRIVES ARE PRO SOCIAL MEANING THEY TEND TO BRING ABOUT BENEVOLENT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE IN THE SENSE THAT SO PROCIA SOCIAL A AS CONSTRUCTIVE RIGHT AS AS INS IS BUILDING GOODNESS THAN YES BECAUSE IT'S THE DRIVE IN US THAT MAKES US ANE TO LOVE AND NURTURE THINGS RIGHT THAT MAKES US ONE A LEARN AND AND SOMETIMES LEARN TO MAKE BETTER IN THE WORLD OR LEARN FOR LEARNING'S SAKE THAT THER THAT THE DRIVE IS A DRIVE OF GOODNESS SO IF THE DRIVE IS THEN GOD ITCAN ENACT ITSELF IN THE WORLD AROUND US IT'S GOING TO BE PRO SOCIAL WTHWWE EXIST AS SOCIAL UNIT'S RIGHT O MEAN IF WE DECIDE WHY WANT TO BE AN ISLAND OFF SOMEWHERELI THAT'S NOT HEALTHY RIGHT WE EXIST IN SOCIAL UNITS FROM SMALL LIKE A NEWCLEAR FAMILY RIGHT TO A NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT ALL THE WAY UP TO NATIONS AND TOTO THE PLANET SO IF WE IF WE PERCEIVE THE TRUTH OF THAT THAT HAY THERE'S AN INTERDEPENDENCE BUT BETWEEN ME AND OTHERS AND AND I SEE THAT THEN THE DRIVE WILL LEAVE TO CHOICES AND BEHAVIORS THAT ARE SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTIVE EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT AGGRESSION AND YOU ARE CLEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT AGGRESSION DOES NOT NESARILY MEAN VIOLENT AGGRESSION A THAT THERE DIFFERENT FORMS OF AGGRESSION MCURIOUS IF YOU COULD GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU'VE OBSERVED AM PEOPLE WITH HIGH LEVELS OF AGGRESSION AND HIGH LEVELS OF PLEASURE DRIVE AS WELL BOTH MALE AND FEMALE AND YOU KNOW HEAR WITHOUT ON DEFAULTING DISTERIOTYPES I THINK LOT OF YOU UST DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE CLARIFIED WHAT AGGRESSION IS AN ISN'T INESS IN THE CONTECTS OF THIS CONVERSATION WE HEAR THE WORD AGGRESSION AND WE THINK A VERBAL ATTACK PHYSICAL ATTACK HOWEVER THE WAY YOUR DESCRIBING AGGRESSION AND THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE I HAVE A FEELING THAT YOUR REFERRING TO OTHER EXPRESSIONS OF AGRESSION AS WELL SO IF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS RUNNING TOO HIGH AND THAT CULD HAVE FAC TORS OF NATURE FACTORS OF NURTURE BY FACTORS OF THE SITUATION THE PERSON IS IN FACTORS OF THEIR WHOLE LIFE BUT IT ENDS UP AT THE MOMENT IN A PLACE THAT IS TOO HIGH THEN WHAT THAT PERSON IS DOING IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IS TO TRY AND EXERT AN UNHEALTHY LEVEL OF CONTROL AND THAT CAN BE DONE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IT CAN BE DONE IN THAT OVER WAY OF AF JIST INTIMIDATING PEOPLE RIGHT OF OF USING HARSH LANGUAGE FOR ITS PEOPLE CAN BE DONE BY MANIPULATING PEOPLE THIT CAN BE DONE THROUGH PASSIVE AGGRESSION THART THERE ALL SORTS OF WAYS THAT THE PERSON CAN TRY AN EXERT UNHEALTHY CONTROL BUT THAT'S WHERE WE END UP IF THERE'S TOO MUCH EXPRESSION OF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IN US THAT MAKE SENSE AND IT REMINDS ME OF AN EXAMPLE FOR MY OWN LIFE WHERE I FOR SOME I SHOULD SAY I'VE HAD ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY POSITIVE COLLABORATIONS AMONG MY COLLEAGUES AT STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE I  EVERY ONE OF THOSE COLLABORATIONS AS ENDED IN A PAPER THAT WE WERE ALL HAPPY WITH BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE RELATIONSHIPS GREW AND A WERE NOT DIMINISHED IGHT IM BUT I HAD ONE COLLABORATION WAS SOME ONE NOT TO BE NAMED WHERE UM IT WAS GOING VERY WELL BUT I HAD THE NEED TO RESCHEDUL AN APPOINTMENT A SO I SENT AHAD A NOTE ABOUT THE FACT THAT MY CARNEA DEALING WITH I HAD SOME OTHER THINGS I EXPLAINED WHY I NEED TO RESCADUAL THE APPOINTMENT IM AND DIDN'T RECEIVE A REPLY WHICH WAS A  UNUSUAL BUT THEN EVENTUALLY RECEIVED A REPLY THAT SAID UM WELL IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO PURSUE THIS COLLABORATION RESLICT THE FURTHEST THING FROM THE TRUTH RIGHT AND SO IKES U AND SO I EXPRESSED THAT AND THEN THE COLABORATION WAS REINSTATED BUT IT BROUGHT TO MIND SOME CONCERN FOR ME AM BECAUSE OF SORT OF EXTREME REACTION TO IN O SOMETHING A HAPPENS AMON ACADEMICS A  OR ANY ONE WE GET BUSY WITH THINGS COME UP IT WAS IMPORTANT ATTEND TO A THE CAR THAT IS AND THEN AT SOME POINT LATER UM THEY WERE LATE TO A NUMBER OF MEETINGS OQE NO BIDEAL R ACADEMICS WE THEND TO RUN LATE THAT'S TYPICAL OF MANY ACADEMICS UT THEN I WAS LATE ONCE TO A MEETING AND THE ESSENTIALLY LEFT AND WROTE ANYMEL THAT SAID SOMETHING OF THE SORT LIKE I'VE GOT MY OWN GREAT IDEAS SO I'M NO LONGER INTERESTED IN PURSUING THE COLLABORATE AND I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED RIGHT BECAUSE UAM THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY IN TERMS OF BUSINESS AND PREFASSORIAL SCHESULES AND ND THEREWERE OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVE POSTOCS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ND THERE WAS A GREAT PROJECT TO BE YOU NOT TO BE WORKED OUT SO I REMEMBER BEING DISAPPOINTED BUT ALSO REALLY CAN SURPRISE BUT THEN WHEN I MAPPED IT BACK TO THE EARLIER EXAMPLE OF THE RAK HARDS AND I THOUGHT WELL LI THAT THERE'S A REAL UMOR LACK OF ABILITY THI'S PERSON TO HANDLE DISAPPOINTMENT AND YET THEY'RE EXERTING OR DEMONSTRATING RATHER SOME O THE SAME BEHAVIOUR OF CASIONALLY RUNNING TARDY IN THESE KINDS OF THINGS AM AND I REMEMBER FEELING LIKE THOS PRETTY GRESSIVE IKE'S A RETTY AGGRASSIVE REACTION TO SOMETHING THAT EL COUD HAVEBEEN HANDLED WITH A CONVERSATION NOW I MUST SAY I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE COLABORATION DIDN'T PROCEED AND IT WENT ELSEWHERE AND  WORKED OUT GREAT AND THEY'RE DOING GREAT AND WE'RE DOING GREAT AND A NO HARD FEELINGS BUT AM IT STANDS OUT TO ME AS IT AS A PRETTY SALIENT EXAMPLE OF A GRESSION BUT NOT PLAYED OUT AT THE LEVEL OF YELLING OR ANYTHING THERE'S A HOSTIVITY IN THERE BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO KIND OF A A KIND OF ENTITLEMENT AND HERE OF COURSE I'M ONLY LOOKING AT THE OTHER PERSON'S BEHAVIOUR AND I SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE I REALIZE CANCELLING NOT GOOD BEING LATE NOT GOOD BUT LISTEN I'M A HUMAN BEING AND I YOU CAN'T AT ONCE YOU WERE LATE AS IS THIS IS  ADIT THIS IS INHABITUAL THIS IS HUMAN STUFF RIGHT RIGHT AND AND A LOT OF AM A LOT OF GOOD WORK HAD GONE INTO THE PROJECT I AND THERE WAS A COST WHERE A YOU KNOW A MOST MOST IMPORTANTLY THE POST OKS OFFERED BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T INVOLVED IN THESE INTER ACTIONS AT ALL AND AND YET THAT THE PROJECT HALTED AT THAT POINT AM SO TO ME THAT SEEMS LIKE AN EXAMPLE OF AM SOMEBODY WHO HAS A WELL TRONG AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND THAT'S CLEAR FROM THE THEYARE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN IN THE ACADEMIC DOMAIN I'M AN WHEN DISAPPOINTED YOU KDON'T LASHES BACK OR AS PASSIVE ONE OR ONE OR THE OTHER IS THAT IS IS THAT ONE WE'RE GETTING OUT HERE T I'M NOT SURPRISINGLY PERHAPS THAT THE PERSON RARELY PUBLISHES WITH OTHER PEOPLE RIGT OBIN THAT DOESN'T MAKE A VERY GOOD COLLABORATIVE PARTNER RIGHT AND IT IS TOLLY MAKE SENSIMENT IFTHINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR DESCRIBING HERE TWHICH IS SOME VOLNRABILITY IN THE PERSON THERE'S SOME WAY IN WHICH TE PERSON DOESN'T FEEL GOOD ENOUGH NO MATTER WHAT THIS PERSON IS ACHIEVED SO THEN THERE'S A SENSE OF OF THE NEED AND THE RIGHT TO OVER CONTROL SO WHEN YOU AGREE TO WORK TOGETHER YOU KNOWT YOU DIDN'T AGREE THAT I'LL NEVER HAVE TO CANCEL ANYTHING RIGHT UT BUT BUT THE THOUGHT WAS DIFFERENT THE FRAMING IS DIFFERENT ON THE ON THE OTHER HAND HAT NOW WE WE'VE WERE IN A WORK TOGETHER RIGHT SO I'M EXERTING SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER YOU RIGTNIGAN YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF IT RIGHT AND  MAY BE HE'S NOT AWARE OF IT IN THIS CASOR WAS ACHE OH T SO THAT WAS THINKING SOME ONE DIFFERENT BUT SHE HAS TO HAVE SOME DEFICITE HIMSELF THAT THAT RESULTS AND IN THE REFLECTIVE NEED TO OVER  CONTROL AND AND THINK ABOUT THE FIRST RESPONSE IS A NON RESPONSE RIGHT WHICH IS THAT S AGGRESSION WHICH JUS IS JUST PASSIVE AGGRESSION RIGHT THE THOUGHT WOULD BE WHET YOU YOUR WORRY SOMETHING TOSN'T FEEL GOOD IN YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T RESPOND WHICH WAS TRUE RIGHT YOUR EXPECTING A RESPONSE MAY BE DON'T KNOW DID YOU GET THE EMALE YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IS HE MAD SO AS SORT OF EFFECTIVE TO CREATE SOME CONSTERNATION AND SOME DISSETENCE IN YOU GT THEN ON TOP OF THAT THE PERSON IS WILLING TO POTENTIALLY AT THAT POINT SACRIFICE THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT TO THINK ABOUT AGGRESSION NOW IS NOT GOOD RIGHT THIS ACCESS AGGRESSION IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU IT IT ALSO IS CLEARLY ECLIPSING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE RIGHT IS IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS PERSON AND THE RESEARCH IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS PERSON AND THE POST OX IN THEIR LAG RGHT BUT BUT THE PERSON IS WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT IN THE SERVICE OF GRATIFYING THE ACCESS IN AGGRESSION NOW SO THEN YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT THEN TO O MADE AT OQUET RIGHT FOR THE SHORT TERM O KAT THN THE PERSON FEELS GRATIFIED LIKE WHETHER YOU APOLOGIZED OR NOT THEY TOOK IT AS YOU KNOW YOU'V TO SOME DEGREE BOWED DOWN BEFORE ME NOW LIKE IT'LL BE OQ FOR AT LEAST FOR THE SHORT TERM RIGHT BUT THEN THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS ACTUALLY DOES END THE COLLABORATION IHT SO THAT'S NOT GOOD RIGHT AND AND YOU SEY EVEN FROM A SELF SERVING PERSPECTIVE THAT PERSON WAS COLLABORATING WITH YOU FOR REASON RIGHT SHE SAW A BENEFIT TO THE SCIENCE THAT SHE'S VERY VERY INTERESTED IN THROUGH THE COLLABORATION WITH YOU BUT THEN LET THAT ALL GO RIGHT IN THE SERVICE OF WHAT IN IN THE SERVICE OF OF THE EGO RIGHT OF IT MIGHT YE I DON'T FEEL GOOD ENOUGH ABOUT MYSELF RIGHT THE RESPONSE TO THAT THEN IS IT IS A RESPONSIVE ENVY THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY THEN I WANT YOU TO RIGHT DON'T LIKE ANY THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT I DON'T CONTROL YOU AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO AND ULTIMATELY IT'S THAT ENVY THAT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE SO IT'S A SET BACK FOR THAT PERSON IT'S DESTRUCTIVE OF THE SCIENCE THAT PERSON WAS DOING IT'S DESTRUCTIVE OF THE SCIENCE THAT YOU WERE DOING SO ENVY IS DESTRUCTIVE AND HERE THE THE THE HIGH LEVEL OF AGGRESSION THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVES AT A VERY HIGH PLACE IT'S EXCEEDING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS'T HIGH ENOUGH EITHER ITIS NOT ENOUGH PLEASURE COMING FROM THE GREAT SCIENCE THAT'S BEING DONE RIGHT SO THEN THE PERSON IS APPROACHING THE WORLD THROUGH THE LENDS OF ENVY RIGHT THEY DON'T FEEL GOOD ENOUGH THEY WANT IT EXERT THAT AGGRESSION THROUGH OVER CONTROL AND WHAT THEY END UP DOING IS DESTRUCTIVE RIGHT AND IT'S VERY CLEARLY DISTRUCTS A GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S DESTRUCTIVE OF THE SCIENCE WHICH IS A OSTENSIBLY THE REASON THAT YOU'RE THERE RIGHT IT'S THE REASON YOU WERE THERE BUT SOME ONE WHO NEEDS TO EXERT OVER CONTROL IS THERE NOT JUST FOR THAT REASON AND THEN THE OTHER REASONS CAN TRUNK THE GENERATIVE REAS AND THAT THEY'RE THERE AND THAT'S HOW ENVY WHEN WHEN IT IS THE PRODUCT OF AGGRESSION OR PLEASURE SEEKING BEING TOO HIGH ALWAYS UNFAILINGLY CREATES DESTRUCTION AND HOW DIFFERENT IS THAT FROM AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS ACTIVE VERBS T THERE'S THERE'S A SENSE OF AGENCY BUT THE AGENCY ISN'T BEING EXACTLY ENACTED CAUSE IF TH AGENCIES BEING ENACTED IN THE SERVICE OF SCIENCE OR CAREER OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE THIT'S NOT THAT'S NOT GOING SO WELL RIGHT AND IN THE GRATITUDE PART ISN'T ACTIVE LIKE MY GOODNESS I'M I'M HERE IE HAT THIS GREAT CAREER I'VE DISCOVERING THINGS I GET TO SPEND MY LIFE AND SCIENCE I GET TO COLLABORATE WITH YOU LIKE THERE SO MANY THINGS TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IE POSTOX IN MY LAB RIGHT I GET TO NURTURE THEM BECAUSE I KNOW MORE AND I CAN GUIDE THAT THAT'S NOT LEADING RIGHT ENVY IS NOT THOSE THINGS WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THAT AT LEAST IN THIS REALM OF LIFE ALTHOUGH THIS OFTEN NOW THIS BLEEDS INTO OTHER REALMS OF LIFE WHAT YOU THE VAST MAJORITY OF TIMES YOU SEE IS SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT HAVE HAPPINESS RIGHT IN THE WAY THAT WERE THE HAPPINESS WITH THE QUOTETFAY THAT HAPPINESS IS TOU KNOW THE SENSE OF PEACE IGHT THE SENSE OF OF A WELL BEING RIGHT HIS THIS AT BEING ABLE TO DELIGHT IN THINGS CONTENTMENT RIGHT THE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THAT RIHT AND HERE IT'S INTERESTING RIGHT THIS PERSON GETS TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF ACADEMIA AND THEIR VERY SUCCESSFUL AND THEY HAVE A LAB OF THEIR OWN AND THEIR COLLABORATING YOU THINK THAT'S ALL GREAT RIGHT BUT NOT INSIDE OF THEM IT'S NOT BRING THEM THOSE THINGS IS EVIDENCE BY HOW THIS PERSON IS BEHAVING AND AND I WOULD BED ALMOST A HUNDRED PERCENT IF YOUS IT WAS THAT PERSON LIKE IN OTHER ASPECTS OF LIFE AT LEAST IN THE PROFESSIONAL REALM PROBABLY IN OTHERS TOO NO ONES CAN DESCRIBE A HAPPY PERSON SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID CAPTURES THIS INDIVIDUAL OM EXTREMELY WELL AND DOM IT ALSO REMINDS ME THAT SO MUCH OF THE WAY THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING THIS AGR ESSIVE DRIVE CAN ALSO BE OBSERVED PERHAPS IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE SHOW UP TO SOCIAL INTERACTIONS NOT NESARILY BIG INTERACTIONS MAY BE INTEREST INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHAT IM I'M THINKING OF HERE IS THAT THE PERSON MALE OR FEMALE WHO SHOWS UP AND AND JUST KIND OF TAKES OVER LIKE IKE TALKS THE WHOLE TIME AND TELLS STORIES I WENT TO A MEALE WT THE WHEN I A GRADUATE UNIVERSITY AND SOME ONE SHOWED UP FOR THE FIRST TIME UM T THIS MEAL A MEANING WE 'D NEVER MET THEM BEFORE AND JUST LIKE SAT DOWN AND JUST STARTED TELLING STORIES FLICKAND HOWER AND IT WAS INTERESTING PORTIONS OF IT WERE CAPTIVATING AND THEN AT SOME WHO I REALIZE LIKE THIS THIS IS EITHER TOTAL PATHOLOGY LIKE THIS PERSON AS IS CRAZY BUT THEY WEREN'T CRAZY OR UM THEY HAVE NO RECOGNITION THAT THEY'RE ABSORBING ALL THE OYGEN IN THE ROOM AS IT SOMETIMES DESCRIBE UM BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THEY HAD THIS NEED TO JUST CONTROL THEWHOLE ENVIRONMENT BY WAY OF SPEECH JUST LIKE YOU KNOW FIREHOSE STORIES UM AND I'VE SEEN THIS DETLYNG IN THE ACADEMIC REALM I'VE SEEN THIS IN THE NONACADEMIC REALM IN SOCIAL SETTINGS AND AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS PERHAPS WHY THIS PERSON DOES THIS OVER THESE PEOPLE DO THIS BUT WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING AS HOW PEOPLE REACT TO IT THET ON THE ONE HAND IT I THINK MOST PEOPLE FIND THAT KIND OF OBNOXIOUS BUT THERE ALSO SEEM TO BE PEOPLE WHO SEE THIS AS LIKE OH THAT PERSON AS A LOT OF AGENCY LIKE T AT THE'RE A LEADER LIKE THEY THEY ACTUALLY GRAB A LOT OF THE ANTENTION THAT THEY'RE SEAKING AND WE TEND TO VIEW THOSE PEOPLE AS KIND OF EMPOWERED I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT THEY'RE NECESSARILY EMPOWER BUT THAT PERHAPS I STEMS FROM THE FEELING THAT THE REST OF US I LIKE TO THINK HAVE WHICH IS SOME SENSE OF A SOCIAL ATIQUETTE WHERE THERE SOME GIVEN TAKE YOU KNOW YOU WALK INTO ROOM YOU KIND OF ASSESS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE CONTEXT HERE I THERE SOME LISTENING AS WELL AS SOME SPEAKING AH AND SO ON AND AND SO WHEN SOME ONE SHOWS UP IN KIND OF VIOLATES ALL THOSE RULES ON THE ONE HAND IT IT CAN BE OBNOXIOUS AN OVERTAKE EVE YTHING BUT S SA BEFORE I OTHER'S ALSO THIS THE SENSE A LIKE OLIKE THAT MUST BE NICE TO JUST BE ABLE TO LIKE BI BE AS ONE ONE FEELS AM AND SO I GET UM I'M DESCRIBING THIS NOT BECAUSE I I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD MMAKE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR EITHER WAY YOU DON'T BE REALLY ME CANNOT SAY ANYTHING THAT'S ON THEIR MIND OR OR JUST OVERTAKE BUT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT MIGHT BE AN EXPLORATION OF THE SUGGRESSIVE DRIVE UM AND IF SOME ONE I'S DOING THAT OR ARE THEY TRYING TO LIE MASKS SOMETHING ELSE U AND WHY DO PEOPLE REACT TO O THESE SEEMINGLY POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THIS WAY THESE THINGS HAPPENED IN THE WORLD AROUND US THERE INDEPENDENT OF THE SPECTRUM OF GENDER THE SPECTRUM OF INTELLIGENCE ACHIEVEMENT RIGHT THE THE THE'R HUMAN PROBLEMS SO A PERSON YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHETHER THAT PERSON HAS CHARACTER STRUCTURE PROBLEMS THAT THAT ARE PRESENT WITH THEM ACROSS TIME OR WHETHER THE'RE IN A CERTAIN PLACE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S IN LIFE OR TO DAY LIKE WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE UNDER PINNINGS BUT BUT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS IT'S A PRESENTATION OF NARCICISM I ANER NARCICISM IS ROOTED NOT IN CONFIDENCE NOT IN ARROGANCE RIGHT IT'S ROOTED IN VONERBILITY IT'S ROOTED AND I DON'T FEEL GOOD ENOUGH AND NARCCISM THEN THEN ENGAGES WITH THE WORLD THROUGH THE LENS OF ENVY SO NO ONE ELSE GETS TO HAVE ANY TIME NO ONE ELSE GETS TO SAY ANYTHING FUNNY NO ONE ELSE MAY BEGETS TO SAY ANYTHING AT ALL RIGHT THE THERE'S THERE'S A DOMINANCE OF THE ROOM RIGHT THERE'S A DOMINANCE OF THE ROOM THAT COMES THROUGH AN INABILITY TO TOLERATE THE BACK AND FORTH OF HUMAN INTERRACTIONS RIGHT HUMAN ENGAGEMENT SO THEN THAT PERSON BECOMES VERY DOMINANT AND WHY IS THAT BECAUSE WHEN THEY TELL A STORY AND THEY GET A LAUGH OR EVEN IT'S NOT THAT FUNNINISS TE FIFTEEN STORY BUT SOMEBODY SMILES A LITTLE BIT OR NOBODY SMILES THEY CAN PERCEIVE IN SIDE THAT LIKE I JUST DID THAT I SAID THAT AND MAYBE SOMEBODY RE PONDEDPOSITIVELY FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT FOR A SPLIT SECOND NOW THAT'S GONE AND THEY THEN YOU KNOW THAT THE NEXT THING COMES AND THE NEXT THING COMES BECAUSE BPEOPLE WHO ARE COMING AT THE WORLD THROUGH THE LENDS OF NARCICISM WHETHER IT'S JUST IN THAT PARTICULAR EVENT RIGHT OR IT'S A CROSS LIFE RIGHT ARE NEVER SATISFIED AND NOTHING EVER BRINGS ENOUGH GOODNESS NOTHING EVER BRINGS ENOUGH FEELING OF PLEASURE SO THE PERSON THEN WANTS MORE AND THAT'S HOW THE PERSON DOMINATES THE ROOM NOW THAT CAN BE VERY SEDUCTIVE RIGHT NARSISISTIC PEOPLE NOT ALWAYS BUT ARE OFTEN VERY SEDUCTIVE BECAUSE OF THAT APPEARANCE OF MASTERY RIGHT OF CONTROL SO THAT PERSON DID HAVE WWE COULD LOOK AT IT IN THE SHORT TERM AN SAY THAT PERSON HAD MASTERY OVER THE ROOM RGHT NO ONE SAID ANYTHING FOR AN HOUR BUT THEM RIGHT SO THEY HAD MASTERY OVER THE RIM TIT CONTROL OVER THE ROOM BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS EXERTING OVER CONTROL RIGHT IN THE SURTS LIKE YOUR PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH RIGHT THAT BUT BORROW A DOLLAR TO DAY TO PAY BACK A HUNDRED TO MORROW RIGHT BEAUSE THEY GOT TO CONTROL THAT ROOM BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE NOT EVERY ONE RIGHT SOME PEOPLE IS SEDUCED BY IT RIGHT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THAT SOMETHING IT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING SOMETHING THAT WASN'T MUTUAL THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE PERSON WANTES TO COLLABORATE WITH THAT PERSON EVEN BE IN THE SAME SPACE AS THAT PERSON RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S COUNTER PRODUCTIVE RIGHT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT COME UNDER THE SPELL SO TO SPEAK RIGT THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BROUGHT UNDER THE SPELL RIGHT THAT THEY'R LESS OBSERVING DYNAMIC YOU INTUITIVE INTROSPECTIVE THAT TH THE'R THE'R NOT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WANT IN A SENSE ON YOUR SIDE RIGHT THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE MOST VALUABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH EVEN AS FAULT PARTNERS HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH RIGHT THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PUT OFF BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG THEY KNOW IT THAT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD AND THEY MAP DO I WANT THAT FEELING MORE IN MY LIFE NO RIGHT SO THAT'S THTHE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE ASPECTS WOT THAT'S WHY NARSISM IS DESTRUCTIVE BE YOU MIGHTS L LOS NOTHING DESTRUCTIVE IN THAT YOU KNOW IN THA T INTERACTION BUT CAN YOU HAVE TO BE STANDING SO UP CLOSE TO IT THAT YOU DON'T SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE IS WHEN YOU STAND BACK FROM THAT THAT'S NOT A PERSON WHOS BY AND LARGE YOU KNOW YOU SEE THAT'S NOT A PRISONEWS INTERCONNECTED IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM HAS A GROUP OF GOOD SUPPORTED FRIENDS HAS A BUNCH OF COLLEAGUES WHERE THEY CANS OFE EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND AND YOKCAUSE ALL THAT SOCIAL DYNAMIC HAS TO HAPPEN IN THE REST OF LIFE SO YOU SEEN IS SITUATION THAT IS THAT IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE THAT IS DESTRUCTIVE AND YOU ALWAYS SEE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE ENACTING NARCISISM WHETHER IT'S OKE BUT MUCH ABOUT THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND FOR WHATEVER REASON LIKE I'M AN AN UNHEALTHY PLACE AND I'M ENACTING IT RIGHT NOW OR IF I'M ENACTING IT EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE BECAUSE IT'S IN MY CHARACTERSTRUCTURE AND I HAVEN'T RECOGNIZE AND AND CHANGE IT IT'S ALWAYS DESTRUCTIVE THE NARCISES THAT I'VE KNOWN AND OBSERVED ALMOST ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE A PARTNER WHO IM CLEARLY SUPPORTS THEIR NARCICISM EARLEAST DOESN'T SPEAK UP VERY MUCH AGAINST IT ALEAST NOT PUBLICLY AND NOT MUCH ELSE EXCEPT A PROFESSIONAL RULE IM IN FACT THERE'S ONE SCIENTISTS WHO I DID NOT WORK WITH WHO COMES TO MIND AN AND THE JOKE ABOUT HIM WAS ALWAYS THAT IM THIS PERSON WOULD TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES ENDLESSLY FOR THE FIRST HALF HOUR THAT YOU RUN INTO THEM AND SAY O KA WELL ENOUGH ABOUT ME WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT ME  IUM THIS PERSON MOVED TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY WITH THEIR PARTNER COMES BACK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE HAS ASSENTIALLY DONE NOTHING OVER THE LAST IM THE DECADOR SO CAN  LEFT THE FIELD AND IM ITS CONTHER THAT SECRETLY THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE FIELD A THERE WAS A ONE OTHER ANECDOTE ABOUT THIS PERSON I'M JUST II'M NOT PICKING ON THEM I'M JUST TRYING TO EXPLORE THAT TH THESE DIMENSIONS OF AGGRESSION AND AND AN LOW PLEASURE A DRIVE  AN ENVY IM AT LAD MEETINGS WHOSE IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT THEY THEY WOULD HOST A BASKETBALL GAME IM BUT IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT YOU IM DID NOT WANT A SCORE LIKE YOU KNOW ON THIS PERSON IIM BECAUSE YOU WOULD I BE ASKED TO LEAVE TH A LAB AND INDEED SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE ASKED TO LEAVE THE LABORATORY FOR HAVING MADE EMBARRASS THAT THE LAB HAD AT ONE OF THESE LAB EVENTS I BY PARTICIPATING IN EXACTLY THE EVENT THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE WAY IT WAS DESCRIBED AND DOING SOMETHING COMPETENT RIGHT SO I SO THAT THE GAME WAS ESSENTIALLY WAY FOR THE PERSON TO BUILD THEMSELVES UP AND THEY WERE A MEDIOCRE AT BEST BASKETBALL PLAYERS SO IT LIKE HERE'S THIS GAME WHERE EVERYONE'S EXPECTED TO PRETEND RIGHT AND I HAVE TO IMAGITE THAT PRETEND THAT THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY BETTER AT WHAT THEY DO THAN THEY ARE AND AND AND IN SOME WAYS LIS IT FEELS LIKE A LIKE A REPLICOFS OF HOWNOR SYSTEM SHOWS UP IN SO MANY OTHER AIRS OF LIFELY YOU SAID YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE RARELY SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO UM ARE ACTUALLY VERY BRIGHT ITSELF YOU KNOW UM A SELF EFFACING ET CETERA YOU KNOW WHO UM THEY TEND TO GATHER PEOPLE THAT JUST SUPPORT THEM WERE NO ONE AT ALL BECAUSE BECAUSE NO REASONABLY HEALTHY PERSON WOULD WE CHOOSE TO BE ROUND THAT RIGHT YOU  C BECAUSE THAT THAT GAME IS A METAPHOR FOR ALL OF LIFE FOR THAT PERSON IT'S SENDING THAT MESSAGE LIKE SEE THIS MESSAGE AND EXTRAPOLATED OUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE I WI WI AND WHAT IS SO WHAT'S THE METAR FOR WHAT TO COMMUNICATEG IS COMMUNICATING THAT YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING BETTER THAN I DO Y YOU DON'T RISE ABOVE ME INTERESTINGLY TAT YOU DON'T ARISE ABOVE ME IN ANY WHY YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW THINGS I DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T COUN DO ANYTHING BETTER THAN THAN THN I THAN I DO RIGHT OR I WILL BE DESTRUCTIVE TOWARDS YOU RIGHT IT'S IT'S FASCINATING MAKES I'S NOT ABOUT THE GAME RIGHT THETHE THE GAME IS A WAY OF OF OF COMMUNICATING THAT MESSAGE RI ANGN THE PERSON THAT EVEN THAT GOOD AT THE GAME LIKE WHY NOT CHOOSE SOMETHING YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT RIHT CAUSE IN THE THE MESSAGE IS NOT COMMUNICATED AS CLEARLY RIGHT THE WATIS THIS COM ITG IS UNCONSCIOUS LET'S CHOOSE SOMETHING ON KIND OF FAIR TO MIDDLING AT RIGHT AY THEY MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT NO ONE GETS TO BE BETTER OR I DO SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE TO THEM MAN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS AND AND IMAGINI SOMEONE IS THROWN OUT OF OF THE LAB RIGHT MEAN THAT THIS IS IN MANY WAYS O THE BIGGEST THING IN YOUR LIFE OR ONE OF THE BIGGEST H AS  ANTINGENERATIVE I'M AN READY THE COST OF THAT IN THE LARGER WORLD IS ONE LESS POTENTIALLY FANTASTIC SCIENTISTS RIGHT AND THAT'S THE BROADER THAT'S ALWAYS THE BROADER PICTURE BECAUSE THE NARSSIST IS STANDING VERY VERY CLOSE TO THE TAPESTRY RIGHT AND AS SO SO THE INTERACTION THERE IS I'M YOU HAVE SQUARED A BASKET WHEN I HAVE NOT RIGHT SO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EXCEED ME AND NOW I WILL GET RID OF YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE DANGEROUS TO HAVE AROUND RIGHT BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THE MESSAGE AND AND YOU MAY EXCEED ME AND OTHER WAYS AND ALSO I GEAN T FEEL BETTER BECAUSE I'VE THE POWER TO BE PUNATIVE RIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT'S WANTONLY PUNATIVE RIGHT AND UNCOMPLETELY UNJUSTIFY BUT I'VE THE POWER TO DO THAT AND IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL GOOD THAN TO PUSH YOU AWAY AND I NOTICE I CAN BE GOOD FOR YOU AND I'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT RIGHT BUT THAT DOESN'T LAST OF COURSE THIT'S WHY THE PERSON CONTINUES TO DO IT AND IT ALSO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL THAT THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR SCIENCE RIGHT OR MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME RIGHT IS A GRADUATE STUDEN N THAT LAB AS YOU DIDN'T SAY FIRE THE GRADUATES TO MAKE THE GRADUATESOON A LEAVE IF THE PERSON WASN'T GOOD NO IT'S MAKE THE GRADUATE SOON LEAVE NO MATTER WHAT SO THE PERSON IS DOING THINGS THAT ARE INJURIOUS TO THE SOCIETY AROUND US OBVIOUSLY TO THE SPECIFIC PERSON THEY'R TARGETING AND ALSO TO THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHERE IF YOU FOLLOW IF YOU FOLLOW ENVY AND YOUN YOU SEE I LEVELS OF IT IN SITUATIONS THAT ARE UNBOUNDED S LIKE THIS SITUATION IS UNBOUNDED IN THE SENSE OF THE PERSON CAN DO THAT THERE'S NO HIGHER AUTHORITY RIGHT RAHT LABS  NO THIS IS CHANGING AND BY THE WAY I SHOULD BACK UP A SECOND AND SAY THAT I DO BELIEVE AN IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THE MOST SCIENTISTS AND LABHEADS ARE IT NOT NARAISAS ARE QUITE KIND OUR BENEVOLENT EN THEY REAL OLD QUORK YOU WERE SCIENTISTS AFTER ALL BUT I'M BUT NOT NARSISIS I'M AT THE SAME TIME IT IS TR UE THAT FOR A LONG TIME LESS SO NOW LABORATORIES WERE SORT LIKE LITTLE FIEFTUMS THERE 'S VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT FROM THE UNIVERSITIES AND SO THE LAB YOU JOINED BECAME YOUR ENTIRE WORLD AND LANDSCAPE RIGHT AND THERE WAS SOME EXPLOITATION BY NARSISISTIC LABHEADS FOR SURE UM YAS YOU SAID IT WAS UNBOUNDED RIGHT LIKE TERE WAS NO OVERSIGHT WHEREAS THIS WOULD BE MUCH HARDER TO RECREATE TO DAY IF SOME ONE E WANTED TO AND I THINK THAT'S WHY BY ALMOST EVERYONE LISTENING TO THIS WELL IT WILL RESINATE WITH THEM WEY'LL FIND SOME FAMILIARITY BECAUSE YOU SEE THIS YOU CAN SEE THIS IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE'S A BOUNDED GROUP OF PEOPLE WRIGHTS US JUST A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN SITUATION AND THAT'S WHO THEY ARE BUT THE AUTHORITY OF THE PERSON LEADING THE GROUP IS UNBOUNDED SO THERE'S A SITUATION WHERE IF THAT PERSON HAS NARCISTIC TENDENCIS AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS TOO HIGH PLEASURE DRIVE IS HIGH BUT NOT BEING MET IF ALL THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE THIS COME TO LIGHT WHICH IS WHY THE DESTRUCTION VARIES BASED UPON THE DESTRUCTION THAT'S PERMISSIBLE WITH IN THE FRAME WORK RIGHT SO HERE THAT THIS PERSON WASN'T IN LIKE FIRE EVERYONE IN THEIR LAB RIGHT SO IN A SENSE THEY COULD ONLY DAMAGE THEIR LABS SO MUCH ALTHOUGH MAYBE IF YOU DAMAGE YOUR LABS SO MUCH YOU DON'T GET FUNDING YOU ANADVERTANLY SINK YOURSELF RIGHT SO SO EVEN THERE THAT PERSON COULD BRING ABOUT THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE OTHER END WHERE IT'S TRULY UNBOUNDED LIKE IKE IN THE SENSE OF WAR RIHT IF SOMEONE WHO HAD WHO CAN CONTROL A MACHINE OF WAR WHO WHO THEN HAS EVERYTHING RIGHT LIKE OK WHAT THEY NEED RIGHT WELL THEY NEED SOMETHING THEY DON'T HAVE NEVER WILL GET SO SO NOW THEY START IN ACTING WAR AND WAR IS DESTRUCTIVE RIGHTN YOU THINK ALL THAT PERSON WANT SOMETHING AND HOW MANY TIMES TOS TO SOMEONE STARTLE WOR RIGHT THAT'S THIS CLEARLY AN UNJUSTIFIED WATRIGHTS O WAR BECAUSE THEY THEY WANT SOMETHING THEN THEY GET SOMETHING IN THEY'RE SATISFIED  THAT THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES RIGHT THEN THEY GET SOMETHING AT THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED AND THEY WANT MORE SO IN INDISCUSSIONS AT TIMES ABOUT NARCICISM AND ENVY AND AND HOW THAT CAN PLAY OUT ON THE THE WORLD STAGE SO SOMETIMES YOULL HUGE EVENTS IN HUMAN HISTORY WILL COME UP AND PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WILL WLL BRING UP AT OFF HITLER AND AND THEY DO THAT HE ITLERE WANTED THINGS WANTED THINGS KNO THAT THETHE UNBOUND NRCICISM THE UNBOUND ENVY WANTED DESTRUCTION RIGHT THIS IS A PERSON WHO IF THINGS IT CONTINUED TO GO AS THIS PERSON INTENDED RIGHT THERE WOULD HAE BEEN NO ONE LEFT ON EARTH BUT HIM BECAUSE THE PROCESS IS NOTHING BUT DESTRUCTIVE WHICH IS WHY AFTER THE FACT IS INCALCULABLE HUMAN CARNAGE RIGHT AND HE HIMSELF WAS AMONG THE INCALCULABLE HUMAN CARNAGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ENDPOINT OF NARCICISM THAT'S THE OF NARCESISM ON A BROAD STAGE RATE THAT'S THE ENPOINT OF ENVY AT ITS HIGHEST MAGNITUDE HEN WE SEE TAT AS EXAMPLES WHETHER WE SEE ON THE SMALLER STAGE OF THE LAB RIGHT RIGHT AHEAD THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING OR ON THE LARGER STAGE OF OF UNBOUNDED WAR WE END UP WITH DESTRUCTION LIKE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TIME THAT'S THE FINAL COMMON PATHWAY FOR ALL THAT  ARE THERE'S SOME CONSISTENT THEMES OF CHILDHOOD THAT LEAD SOMEBODY TO BECOME A NARSISIS AND IN ADDITION TO THAT I'M CURIOUS WHETHER NOT NARCISIS EVER HAVE INSIGHT WHETHER NOT IF OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE TEN CUPBOARDS UNDER THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF WHETHER OR NOT THEY EVENTUALLY SEE INSIDE THOSE CUPBOARDS ANGO ON MY GOODNESS I'VE GOT THIS A SELF THAT'S CLEARLY OVER INFLATED AND I'VE GOT THESE DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND I'M SO ENVIOUS IN THE AND AND MODIFY THEIR BEHAVIOR OR WHETHER NOT THE NARSIS ARE IMMUNED FROM A CONSTRUCTIVE SELF REFLECTION WITH THE DANO THAT THE FIRST PART IS IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF NARCICISM IT MAY BE ALL F IT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IS IS ROOTED IN THE CHILDHOOD TRAMA OF NOT FEELING GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT WHICH IS NOT AN EXCUSE  FOR PEOPLE DOING DOING AWFUL THINGS IT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SAYING WERE TRYING OF AN EXPLANATORY MECHANISM RIGHT WITWHICH WHICH GOES BACK TO FORMITY OF LIFE EXPERIENCES AND NOT FEELING GOOD ENOUGH WHETHER IT WAS BECAUSE THAT PERSON WAS DIRECTLY DENIGRATED OR THAT PERSON WASN'T DENIGRATED BUT COULD NEVER WORK HARD ENOUGH NEVER COULD COULD BE ENOUGH TO TO TO GET A APPROVAL RIGHT A GET IT'S NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT IF HUMAN BEINGS ARE COMPLICATED BUT IF YOU GO AND LOOK YOU SEE THAT THAT THET WAS NEVER A STATE LIKE ALL I FEEL GOOD ENOUGH ABOUT MYSELF RIHT AND IF THERE'S NEVER A STATE OF I FEEL GOOD ENOUGH ABOUT MYSELF BECAUSE SOME ONE AS TOLD ME THAT AND GIVEN ME THE PADDE ON THE HEAD OR GIVEN ME DEPOSITIVE COMET YOU CAN SEE HOW IN A CERTAIN SUCH A NATURAL LAY OF THE LAN GENETICALLY AND AN INCONCENT WITH IT WITH OTHER EXPERIENCES THAT PERSON CAN GET TO ADULTHOOD WITH WITH A LOT OF AGGRESSION IN THEM AND NEVER HAVING EXPERIENCED I'M GOOD ENOUGH AT STILL RUNNING ALONG INSIDE OF THEM AND THEN THE'RE ENACTING THAT AGGRESSION IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM THAT'S MOST COMMONLY WHAT WE SEE AND BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH DEEP VONERABILITY AND SUCH DEEP INSECURITY THEN PEOPLE IS A PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM FULL BLOWN NARICISM NARCICISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER SO INACTION OF ENVY ON ON THE HIGHEST LEVELS THAT IS THERE'S SO DEFEND THERE'S SO TRONGLY DEFENDED IN AN UNHEALTHY MANNER FROM SEEING THEIR OWN BONE RABILITY THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET THAT PERSON TO COME AROUND AND SAY CAY LET LET'S LOOK IN THOSE TEN CUBERS WITHIN THE FIELD PEOPLE OFTEN TALK ABOUT TREATING NARSICISTIC PEOPLE THEY TALK ABOUT IT ASIN A NIHILISTIC WAY AND AND HOM JUSTLY VERY EXPERIENCED PEOPLE SAY OH THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT THAT NEVER GETS BETTER NOW I'M NOT A BELIEVER IN FAIR PUTE NIHILISM I THINK THAT YES IT IS IT IS THE NORM THAT THAT PERSON JUST CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER TO GO LOOK AT THAT THING THEY'RE SO DEFENDED AGAINST IT THEY'RE SO AFRAID OF IT RIGHT THEY WON'T LOOK ANYWHERE NEAR IT SO THEY'RE LOOKING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION IND TEIR FURTHERING ALL THAT UNHEALTH IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT THAT IT'S ALWAYS THAT WAY AND ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS I HAVE WORKED WITH SINGG IN A WITNESS NARSECISTIC PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE CHANGES NOW IT'S USUALLY IN THE CONTACT OF SOMETHING VERY EXTREME THAT CAUSES THEM TO DO THAT SO SOMEONE WHO'LL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO FAMILY MEMBERS THEY WANT TO SEE OR TO FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT THEY  NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES AFLOOT IS THINGS THAT OFTEN ARE THAT DRAMATIC IS NOT ALWAYS THAT BUT WE CAN SEE THAT IN THOSE KIND OF EXTENUATING SITUATIONS WHERE THE THE PROBLEM IS SO BIG THE ENVY IS SO HIGH IM BUT THE MOTIVATION FOR CHANGES VERY VERY HIGH BECAUSE SENSE UN THE CARRIDAN STICK MODEL THE STICK HERE IS VERY VERY STRONG THAT IF A PERSON THEN GOES AND DOES THAT YOU YOU CAN SEE CHANGE INSIDE OF THEM SO WERE NEVER IN A PLACE OF A FARAPEUTIC NITALISM BUT THEBUT THE THE BARRIERS TO THAT ARE VERY VERY HIGH BECAUSE  THE SELF IS SO WOUNDED THAT THE PERSON IS PROTECTING THAT SELVES SO STRONGLY THAT'S WHY THE NARCESISM AND ENVY ARE SO FULL BLOWN AND IT'S HARD TO GET THAT PERSON TO GO BACK AND LOOK BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE THEY SOME WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IT SEEMS THAT IT'S A VERY LOW PROBABILITY THAT A NONCLINITION COULD CHANGE A NARSESSIS LIKE IN OTHER WORDS IF ONE IS ENGAGING IN THE WORLD WITH TA NARSESIS AM BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PRESUME LEAR THEY JUST FIND THEMSELVES IN THAT PLACE AM WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT PERSON THERE'S VERY LITTLE IF ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO CHANGE THE NARSESSIS BEHAVIOUR AT WORK AM PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAME WORK IF THEY  FOR BECAUSE OF COURSE IF THE NARSIS CAN'T OFTEN DO IT FOR THEMSELVES WITH THE HELP OF A SKILLCLINITION WHAT WHY WOULD AN WHY WOULD ANY ONE ELSE BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE WERE COMING AT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS RIGHT AND THAT TRUTH BRINGS WITH IT HOPEFULNESS I IT BRINGS WITH IT HOPEFULNESS THAT PEOPLE CAN CHANGE AND HOW PEOPLE CAN CHANGE AND AND AND I AM A HUNDRED PERCENTIT ALL FOR THAT IT'S THE WAY TO LOOK AT OURSELVES RIGHT BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THERE ARE ASPECTS OF PATHOLOGY THAT THAT REQUIRE CLINICAL TREATMENT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND SAYING IT THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE AND THERE'S A DEEP PROBLEM HERE AND THAT WE HAVE TO COME OUT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF HOW CAN YOU HELP THAT PROBLEM ND THERE'S A SCIENCE BEHIND THIS TOO OF WHAT LEVEL OF CLINICAL CARE FOR EXAMPLE IT IS MOST LIKELY TO BE HELPFUL TO SOME ONE LIKE THIS AND IT'S NOT AN INDIVIDUAL CLINITION EVEN RIGHT IT'S A TEAM OF PEOPLE WHO WORK THROUGH DIFFERENT MODALITIES YOU CONSIDER WRAP AROUND THAT PERSON SO IT'S NOT JUST A LEVEL OF CLINICAL CARE IS NEEDED BUT IT'S A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF CLINICAL CARE AND THAT IN GENERAL IS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE GET AT NARCISIS N AS NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT BUT THAT'S THE VASMAJORITY OF TIME SO WHAT CAN THEN THE PERSON DO RIGHT A PERSON CANNOT BE A TEAM OF CLINISTIONS RIGHT WHAT THAT PERSON CAN DO ONE CHOICES TO DISENGAGE IHT BUT DISENGAGEMENT CAN COME WITH THE PROMISE OF RE ENGAGEMENT RIGHT MANY MANY TIMES I'VE WORKED WITH PEOPLE AND PRACTISED IN REHEARSE WITH THEM LIKE OOKING WHAT MIGHT YOU SAY TO SOMEONE ALONG THE LINES OF YOU KNOW I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR A LONG TIME WHERE I CARE ABOUT YOU OR I LOVE YOU BUT WHATEVER THEY MAY SAY TO LEAD IN BUT I I CAN'T BE WITH YOU I CAN'T BE AROUND YOU A THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THAT THAT MAKES IT NOT O CAY FOR ME DOESN'T FEEL O KAY IMPRESON MAY BE SAYS THING LOOKING A REGRESSIVE OR DEMEANING OR WHATEVER IT IS WER MAY BE THEY JUST SAY JUST DOESN'T FEEL O K CAN'T HAVE IT AND AND THEN T THE THE NEED TO STEP AWAY FROM THE PERSON BUT  LOOK IF YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP RIGHT IF YOU TOOK BETTER CARE OF YOURSELF IN WAYS IT WOULD WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU AND FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAN OF COURSE I'D WANT TO BE IN YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT'S A DISENGAGEMENT CAN COME YOU KNOW WITH THAT'S AM ENCOURAGEMENT RIGHT TO THE PERSON BUT BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER YOU HAVE TO SET BOUNDARIES WHICH IS A CA I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PERSON SO DEAL WITH THEM A LITTLE BIT UM OR I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PERSON SO I WON'T RIGHT OR I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THIS PERSON O HAVE TO TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TO ME BUT ULTIMATELY SOME FORM OF STRONG BOUNDARIES OR DISENGAGEMENT IS THAT'S THE RESPONSE THAT THAT THAT THAT'S THE SELF CARE RESPONSE RIGHT FOR THE PERSON WISE WHOSE WITH THE NARCISIS WHAT ARE SOME OTHER WAYS THAT THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND PLEASURE DRIVE ENGENERATIVE DRIVE FOR THAT MATTER PLAY OUT FOR INSTANCE WE TALKED ABOUT THE FORMER PATIENT OF YOURS TO EVENTUALLY SWITCH DIBS UM CLEARLY HOW TO GENERATIVE DRIVE WITHIN HIM BUT WAS BEING BLOCKED BY A NUMBER OF CHOICES ROOTED AND NARRATIVES THAT ORIGINATED IN CHILDHOOD ET CETERA WE TALKED ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH AGGRESSIVE DRIVE HIG DEGREE OF PLEASURE DRIVE BUT A VERY DIMINISHED CAPACITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE AND THEREFORE A LOT OF ENVY AND THE DESTRUCTION THAT COMES WITH ENVY S WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER VARIATIONS ON THESE DRIVES AND AS YOU OBSERVE THEM IN YOUR CLINICAL PRACTICE OVER ALL FRAMING IS WE WANT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE TO BE THE ONE THAT'S DETERMINIST IGHT IT'S THE ONE WITH THE STRONGEST INFLUENCE SO WE WANTED D WE WANT A NURTURE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IN US AND IN OTHERS AND AND IT MAKE SEN TRUST A TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT WE'VE LOOKED AT HOW DO THINGS GET OUT OF BALANCE RIGHT AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT IF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE OR THE PLEASURE DRIVE WHAT IF THEY'RE TOO HIGH RIGHT AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT OFTEN NOT ALWAYS WHAT CAN BE DRIVING THEM TO BE SO HIGH OR THINGS THAT AREN'T HEALTHY IN US THE AN THE HIGHER THEY GET THE HARDER IT IS TO GRATIFY THEM SO WE END UP WITH THAT PROBLEM OF ENVY BUT WE CAN BE OUT OF BALANCE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOO RIGHT WHERE WHERE THE PERSON DOES NOT DOES NOT EXPERIENCE ADABILITY TO I'M ENGAGED WITH THE WORLD AROUND THEM RIGHT THEY THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE ANYTHING FOR THE BETTER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THEMSELVES AND IF THEY'RE NOT DOING MUCH AN FEEL THAT THEY CAN DO MUCH AND EN AND ALSO NOT RECEIVING PLEASURE FROM THINGS THERE'S NO GRATIFICATION FROM THE THINGS AT PERSON IS DOING LIKE WE SEE SITUATIONS LIKE THIS TOO WITH THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THE PLEASURE DRIVE OR BOTH AND THEN WE ND UP NOT AT ENVY BECAUSE ENVY IS THE SIDE OF EXCESS BUT WE END UP AT DEMORALIZATION ON THE LOWER SIDE DEMORALIZATION IT IS NOT A SPECIFIC PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS WHO CAN PREDISPOSED TO PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS LIKE THE BIOCHEMICAL ABNORMALITY OF DEPRESSION BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS NOT A PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS RIHT LIKE ENVY IS NOT A PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOS IS LIKE IT'S IT'S A THING THAGHT THEY CAN BE EXPERIENCE THAT CAN LEAD TO DIAGNOSES THE SAME THING WITH DEMORALIZATION IF YOU DON'T FEEL THAT YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO ANYTHING RIGHT AN YOU'RE NOT ENJOYING ANYTHING OR FEELING GRATIFICATION FROM ANYTHING THAN THAT POOL IS GAN WENT OUT THAT'S GOING TO BE A DEMORALIZED PERSON THE SAME WAY OF COURSE WE KNOW AN EXPERIMENTS WHEN NO THE THE IF WE HAVE A A RAT GOING FOR FOOD IF LIKE IF YOU DO IT ENOUGH WHEN THE RAT GOES FOR THE FOOD YOU TAKE THE FOOD AWAY THE RAT STOPS TRYING AND I EARNET HELPLESS RIGT AND NOW RIGHT THAT EXISTS IN US TOO AND IT COMES ALONG WITH ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS AS BEING NOT RATS RIGHT WE HAVE A HOLD MUCH OF THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT OF  MI GI'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH OF NOTHING WILL EVER BE OKAY AND NOW SO DEMORALIZATION THEN IS IS IT CAN BE VERY VERY STRONG IN TAKING A PERSON AW AY FROM THE OTHER THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO SEE I EITHER BECAUSE THAT PERSON HAS THE ESSENTIALLY LEARNET HELPLESSNESS RAY AND ALL THE THINGS THE COMPLICATED THINGS INSIDE OF US THAT CAN COME ALONG WITH THAT WOR THE PERSON ISN'T GAINING PLEASURE FROM ANYTHING SO WHEN WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BE OUT OF BALANCE  WE THINK OK A AGGRESSION AND PLEASURE DRIVE IF IF ONE OR THE OTHER OR BOTH IS TOO HIGH WE END UP AT ENVY AND IF ONE OR THE OTHER OR BOTH ARE TOO LOW WE END UP WITH DEMORALIZATION AND YOU CAN TAKE ALMOST ANY SCENARIO IT COULD BE A SCENARIO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT REALLY NOT GOING WELL FOR A PERSON NOT A CLINICAL SCENARIO IT'S A THING IN A PERSON'S LIFE OR WE CAN TAKE CLINICAL SCENARIOS AND THE VAST MAJORITY OU KNOW OUTSIDE OF OUTLIERS LIKE A HEAD INJRY FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN TAKE THOSE SCENARIOS AND WE CAN LOOK AT IT IN THAT WAY AND WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AT LEAST WE CAN UNDERSTAND AND NOT THAT WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK IN THE TEN CUPBOARDS OF THE TWO PILLARS WE CAN THEN HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF OKE WHAT IS GOING ON WE KNOW THE BASIC PICTURE AND HOW THINGS ARE NOT IN I IN THE BALANCE WE WANT THEM IN NOW WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT ENOUGH TO GO BACK AND THEN LOOK IN THOSE TEN CUPBOARDS AND AND I BELIEVE THAT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING EXCEPT THOSE BIOLOGICAL OUTLIERS LIKE A HEAD INJRY FITS IN TO THAT HURISTIC WHICH IS WHY WE CAN USE IT TO UNDERSTAND WE CAN USE IT TO HELP WE CAN USE IT TO MAKE CHANGE WHAT A POWERFUL LENDS TO THINK ABOUT AND EXPLORE THE SELF AND WERE THINGS ARE WORKING FOR US AND WER THINGS ARE POSSIBLY NOT WORKING FOR US IF I ARE ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE WANTED TO GET SOME READ ON ASSESS THEIR LEVEL OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND THEIR LEVEL OF PLEASURE DRIVE IND THEIR ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE WHAT SORTS OF QUESTIONS WOULD ONE ASK YOU KNOW ON FOR INSTANCE A IS IT A QUESTION OF HOW DRIVEN AM I A HOW HOW MUCH GET UP AND GO DO I HAVE A HOW MUCH PLEASURE DO I A EXPERIENCE FROM AN INTERACTION WITH A POPPY AN INTERRACTION WITH FOOD A IS IT TOO MUCH MIHT LIKE DOES A DRAW ME OFF COURSE ARE THOSE THE SORTS OF VERY SIMPLE BUT I'M PERHAPS ALSO VERY INFORMATIVE QUESTIONS THAT WE COULD START TO USE TO PROBE AR PSYCHE YE I THINK YES BUT I WOULD COME TOP DOWN IGHT SO IF IF THE GOAL OF HEALTH IS THAT AGGRESSION AND PLEASURE THOSE DRIVES AR SUBSERVING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND START TO LOOK THERE RIGHT IF A PERSON CAN TAKE AN HONEST INVENTORY OF SELF LIKE WHAT KIND OF FORCE AND MY BEING IN THE WORLD AROUND ME AND AND THAT COULD MEAN FOR EXAMPLE WHAT KIND OF FORCE AM I BEING IN MY FAMILY I AM I DENEGRATING TO THE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOME AFRAID OF ME WHAWILL KIND OF FORCE MY BEING A FORCE FOR GOOD MY BOLSTERINGLY ET PEOPLE CAN'T ALWAYS SEE THAT IN THEMSELVES AND TAKE STOCK OF THEMSELVES BUT HAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SITUATION WHEN WE THINK A PERSON CAN LIKE THEY CAN BRING TO BEAR WHOM I BEING IN THE WORLD IN OTHER WAYS THINK OF THE EXAMPLE OF THE PERSON WHO NEEDED TO LEAVE THE JOB WHO WHO COULD LOOK AT THAT AND SAY SAY KNOW I'M NOT YOU KNOW I'M NOT BEING GENERATIVE IN THE WORLD IN THE WAY I WANT TOM 'M SON NOT DOING MY JOB AS WELL AS I WOULD WANT TO ON MAKING MY OWN LIFE WORSE RIGHT SO SO THAT PERSON COULD THEN SEE THAT'S OUT OF BALANCE OR IN ANOTHER WAY A PERSON MIGHT SEE KNOW A LOT OF WHAT I'M DOING IS ISELF SERVING OR MAY BE DESTRUCTIVE I CU BE PEOPLE CAN REALIZE THAT RIGHT SO YOU CAN REALIZE BY TAKING AN INVENTORY IFSELF IS IS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WHAT'S DETERMINISTIC IN ME AND AGAIN NOT ALWAYS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROCESS OF EXPLORATION IF THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES IF YOU SAY E'M TRYING TO BE THE BEST PERSON THAT I CAN AND I THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE OVER WHOM I HAVE ANY AUTHORITY RIGHT AND INLIKE I TRY TO BE REASONABLE AND I TRY TO BE FAIR AND I TRY TO BE CIRCUMSPECT AND YOU I TRYAND THINKING SOMEBONE ELSE'S SHOES AN ME NOW I OU NOWI SOMETIMES I HAVE TO SET BOUNDRY'S R EXPECTATIONS OR EVEN PUNISHMENT RIGHT BUT BUT I'M MI CAREFUL ABOUT HOW I'M DOING THAT AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT PERFECT AND I GET THINGS WRONG AT TIMES BUT YOU KNOW I ANT DO THING ON CONTRIBUTING TO THE WORLD I'M DOING WHATEVER I TAKE ON YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I CAN DO IT ON PRODUCTIVE IT WERE I YOU KNOW MYT MI COULD YOU DO AN O Q OR MY FRIENDS OR O OR DOING ALL RIGHT WHATEVER IT IS THAT IF WE CAN COME UP WITH THAT THAN THAN WE GESS AT OK EXHALE LITTLE  LIKE RE IN A GOOD PLACE RIGHT IT DOESN'T MEAN EVERYTHING IS OFTIABLE OF COURSE OR THEN GO LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE WHICH MI MEAN O HOW ASSERT OF AM I RIGHT AM I THE KIND OF PERSON WHO COMES UP TO THE PRECIPICE BUT DOES IT MAKE THE DECISION AM I THE KIND OF PERSON WOS LITTLE TOO ASSERTED AND SOMETIMES I'M SOT OF WALKING ON PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT LIKE A PERSON CAN GO LOOK AT THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE WITHIN THEM WERE PLEASURE SEEKING MY DOING THINGS IT BRING ME GRATIFICATION RIGHT AM I ENGAGING WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND ME IN A WAY THAT BRINGS THE GRATIFICATION THAT ONE MIGHT ONE MIGHT WISH FOR RIGHT SO IF IT'S IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS THERE ROMANCE LIKE ARE WE BEING NICE TO ONE ANOTHER RIGHT SO SO YE CAN GO AND LOOK AT THAT AND SAY AM I GETTING GRATIFICATION FROM THE THINGS I'M DOING RI AM I IN IT MI TAKING THIS WHEEVER THIS DRIVE IS WITHIN ME AND TRYING DISSATISFIED IN REASONABLE HEALTHY WAYS THAT ARE ALSO GOOD FOR OTHERS AND WE'RE BACK TO THE GENERATIVE DRIVE SO THAT'S ONE WAY OF COMING AT IT AND IT'S THE WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BECAUSE NOW WHAT WE TRY TO DO NEXT AND WHAT CAN WE MAKE THINGS BETTER RIKON WE OPTIMIZE THINGS OO AY THINGS ARE OQ RIGHT BUT CAN WE MAKE THEM BETTER BUT LET'S SAY WE SEE THAT THE THETHE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS NOT WINNING THE DAY RIGHT AND PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT THE K I'M SEEKING PLEASURE I IS WHY GOT FOR EXAMPLE I HERE OVER AND OVER TIT'S WHAT THAT'S WH I GOT ADDICTED TO THIS SUBSTANCE IN NOW IS NOT PROVIDING ANY PLEASURE TO ME IS NOW MAKING ME MISERABLE RGHT BUT BUT BUT I WANTED WHAT IT WAS GIVING ME AGAIN THIS DOES IT MEAN THAT THE PERSON IN IT JUST WANTS HAVE THE WORLD'S BEST TIME RIGHT IT MAY MEAN THAT THE'RE REALLY SUFFERING A LOT RIGHT AND THE PLEASURE THAT THAT DRUG GAVE THEM WAS SOME RELIEF FROM PAIN THIS IS HOW MANY MANY PEOPLE THE TRAGICALLY  ENDED UP BECOMING ADDICTED TO AND DYING FROM OPIATES RIGHT BECAUSE IT SAY THET OPIATE AFTER THE SURGERY OR THE OPIATE AFTER THE INJURY THEN IS SOOTHING SOMETHING RIGHT AND IT SOOTHING SOMETHING BECAUSE THA PERSON FEELS LESS BAD ABOUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF THEM HEARE THIS ALL THE TIME THAT THAT THAN FOLSTERS ADDICTION SO SO THAT PERSON LOOKING FOR PLEASURE THAT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WHERE WE WOULD SAY SOME LIGHT HEARTED MANNER THAT PERSON TOOK CHANCES WITH THEIR LIFE I MEAN SOMETIMES WILL SEE THAT BUT BUT MORE AND MORE WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THAN IS RELIEF FROM SUFFERING RIGHTBUT WE CAN GET TO THAT POINT WHERE WERE WE CAN ASCERTAIN FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT THE PLEASURE SEEKING IS IS TOO MUCH AND IF PLEASURE SEEKING AND AGGRESSION OR TOO MUCH WEWE WE BECOME AWARE OF DISSATISFACTION RIGHT IF YOUR IF YOU ARE LYING TOO MUCH ON A GRESSION I ALWAYS WANT MY WAY IT'S NOT ALWAYS GONG A HAPPEN RIGHT OR I ALWAYS WANT THAT PLEASURABLE THING I AWAYS WANT TO FEEL BETTER ITHAT A ALSO DOESN'T HAPPEN RIGHT SO SO THEN THAT CAN GUIDE US TOWARDS BEING AWARE OF WHERE THOSE DRIVES AND IF THE DRIVES ARE HIGH  BUT HOW MUCH I DISSENENCE IS CREATED BY THTHE WHAT'S ACTUALLY COMING OF THE DRIVE RIGHT VERSES A LEVEL TO DRIVE IS TAT SO SO I GUESS IT'S A LONG WAY OF SAYING YES TO YOUR QUESTION BUT I WOULD SO TO COME TOP DOWN BECAUSE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS SO IMPORTANT AND IT DOES GAIT GATE FORWARD I CANT AWERE ARE WE AT YOU KNOW IN THE SPECTURE MOF LIKE HOW HEALTHY AM I OR ARE THEIRE ELEMENTS OF ONHEALTH I WANT A KIND O GO AFTER OR YOU KNOW MY SEEING THINGS IN MYSELF THAT REALLY SAY THINGS IT ARE UNHEALTHY ARE REALLY DOMINATING MY LIFE ARE DETERMINESTIC LIKE ADDICTION YOU KNOW WE JUST JUST ONE EXAMPLE YOU NOW DICTION THINGS IT ARE SELF DESTRUCTIVE RIGHT BECAUSE THEN THAT'S A PLACE TO THEN LOOK AT IT MORE O THE CLINICAL ANDS I MAYBE I WON'T JUST TALK TO ANTRUST AT OTHER YOU KNOW WHEREAN GO WE GET A BOOK BUT MAYBE I SHOULD IT MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE A CLINICAL CARE OF THE EXAMPLE OF A DICTION IS VERY POTENT A AND IT ALSO BRINGS TO MIND THE PERHAPS U LESS APPARENTLY DANGEROUS SITUATION BUT ONE THAT I THINK IS REALLY COMMON WHERE PEOPLE HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THEY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PLEASURE DRIVE BUT THERE'S A KIND OF A PASSIVITY AND DRAINING OUT OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WERE COMPETING OUT OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA A AND THE REASON I I BRING THIS UP AS AGAIN NOT BECAUSE I DISLIKE SOCIAL MEDIA I RELY ON AN YOU SOCIAL MEDIA FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING EXTENSIVELY REALLY BUT IN GOING BACK TO THE PILLARS THAT UNDER LIVE WHETHER OR NOT WE ACHIEVE AN EXPERIENCE AGENCY GRATITUDE PECE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT WITHIN THE PILLAR OF FUNCTION OF SELF THERE'S THIS THING SALIENCE YOU KNOW AND WHAT WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA DOES SEEM TO ME  A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE NEVER BEFORE OBSERVED IN HUMAN EVOLUTION WHERE YOU HAVE A NEAR INFINITE NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTS AVAILABLE TO YOU AND WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS AN A MOVY IS WORTH A BILLIAN PICTURES WHEN IT COMES TO DRAWING OUR ATTENTION M YOU JUST LOOK T YOU GIVE A YOUNG CHILD EVEN AN INFANT AND I PAD I MEAN THAT KID IS IN THE TUNNEL I DON'T NECERILY THINK THAT'S A BAD THING AND THE COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER SCREENS ARE GOING TO BE A PART OF THEIR LIVES NOW AND FOREVER PRESUMABLY BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO UM PERHAPS HAVE THE PROPENSITY FOR A STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE BUT BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAVE A PROPENCY FOR A A PLEASURE DRIVE THEY WAKE UP THEY PICK UP THE PHONE ITLOOK AT THE PHONE YOU KNOW SOMETHING CAPTIVATES THEIR ATTENTION THAN THEYRE THINKING ABOUT THAT IT MIGHT BE I'M SOMETHING THAT BRIN GS THEM DELIGHT BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT AT SOMETHING THAT BRINGS THEM EITHER MILD IRRITATION OR WHERE MILD ENTERTAINMENTS UM MAYBE EVEN INTENSE ENTERTAINMENT FOR A SHORT WHILE BUT VERY QUICKLY MINUTES AN HOURS GO BY IN WHICH WE ARE NOT ENGAGING IN THE WORLD UNLESS WE ARE POSTING VALUABLE CONTENT UM AND SO SOCIAL MEDIA IS A BIT OF IT OF A DRAIN ON THESE DRIVES OND LY IT TAPS INTO THESE DRIVES IN VERY STRONG WAYS AND ALL ONE HAS TO DO IS OBSERVED THE BEHAVIOUR OF PEOPLE IN PUBLIC SPACES NOW I INERPORT A UM ON TRAINS UM EVEN IN THEIR CARS AND APEOPLE ARE SENTIALLY WATCHING T V ALL DAY LONG AND AND IT DOES IT DOES CONCERN ME AND AND I I RAISE IT BECAUSE UM I FEEL LIKE IT IT CAN DISDRACT FROM OUR GENERATIVE DRIVE IN A WAY THAT U IT DOESN'T ESSERELY SPEAK TO ANY KIND OF LIKE DEEP CHARACTER FLAW OR ANY KIND OF SUBCONSCIOUS NARRATIVE BUT JUST AT THAT SALIENTS UM COPBORD A IS IS WHAT CLEARLY SOMETHING WITHIN THAT SALIENTS CUPBOARD IS IS HAPPENING THAT'S UM UNPRECEDENTED UM AND VERY VERY POWERFUL AND POTENTIALLY QUITE DESTRUCTIVE I THINK TO UNDERSTAND THIS I WOULD A CITE DISBELIEF II BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF UNDERAPPRECIATING THE POWER OF THE DISCOVERIES THAT ARE THEN IN THEIR OWN HANDS SO WE DISCOVER GUNPOWDER HOW LONG INTO AR SHOOTING EACH OTHER I WE DISCOVER NEWCLYEFICIENT I NOW ARE WE GOING TO DESTROY THE PLANET I SO SOCIAL MEDIA SINCE IT'S A DISCOVERY TO THINK THAT COMES FROM WHAT WE'VE FIGURED OUT AS HUMANS THAT NOW IS THERE IN IN FRONT OF US AND BIG POWERFUL DISCOVERIES DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT I GUNPOWDER IS VERY POWERFUL AND IF PEOPLE NEED TO HUNT IN ORDER TO SURVIVE BE GUNPOWDER CAN HELP THEM HUNT WITHOUT GETTING HURT AND WE BE MORE SUCCESSFUL RIHT NEWCLYERFISIEN  HAS PROVIDED SOME GOOD THINGS TO HUMANITY BUT IT CAN ALSO DIS RUY HUMANITY SO THI THINK THE SAME IS TRUE HERE THAT WHATWHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SOMETHING OF IMMENSE POWER AND YOU CAN SEE HOW  IF IT GETS OUT A BALANCE SO TO LET'S USE THE SAILING SO LET'S SAY THE SOCIAL MEDIA IS TOO SALIENT RIGHT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A PROBLEM RIGHT IF IT'S TOO SERIENT IN THE SENSE THAT THE PERSON IS ALWAYS LOOKING AT THINGSTHAT DON'T MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT WELL THAT'S NOT GOINGTO GO WELL AND THAT'S GOING EFFECT WHAT'S IN THOSE OTHER IT TEN CUPBOARDS RIGHT AND WHAT IS BUILT ON TOP OF IT SO THEN IT GETS INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS MINE LIKE OH I THOUGHT I WAS GOOD ENOUGH UNTO LIKE NOW LOOKING AT ALL THE SOCIAL MEDIA AND I REALIZE I'M NOT I MEAN THIS IS PEOPLE WHO DO TREAT TINS YOU KNO OFTEN TALK ABOUT THIS THAT YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT OUDIDN' OFTEN SEE BEFORE WHERE A PERSON WHO MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH A LOT OF FORMED OF YEARS THINKING LIKE LIKE OH HOW I LOOK IS OQ FOR EXAMPLE THEN IS BOMBARDING THEMSELVES WITH SOCIAL MEDIA THAT TELLS THEM HOW THEY LOOK IS NOT OK AND THEN THAT CHANGES ABSOLUTELY OR PERHAPS SOCIAL ME IS JUST SIMPLY ABSORBING A TON OF TIME AND ENERGY BUT MOSTLY TIME THAT COULD BE DEVOTED TO TO A GENERATIVE FORCE RIGHT THAT'S IT THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF ITS TO THING ABAT THE EXAMPLE OF THE PERSON WHO I KNOW IT WASN'T SOCIAL MEDA BUT WE'RE SAND WOAT IF IT WERE SOCIAL MEDIA THAT INSTEAD OF NINETY MINUTES A DAY YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S EIGHT HOURS CAUSE THERE'S AN ANALOGUE THERE RIGHT ONLY SEE A LOT OF THIS AND IT'S TAKING SOMETHING THAT THAT CAN BE GOOD RIGHT AND CAN ANDY SINCE IND SAID YOU COULD EVEN SHOULD BE GOOD LIKE THERE'S ENOUGH OUT THERE RIGHT IN TERMS OF LEARNING AND BOLSTERING THAT LIKE WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE GOOD RIGHT BUT IT'S NOT GOOD BECAUSE THE DEFENCE IS THEN SHIFF LIKE IF YOR IF YOU WERE LYING ON IT TEN HOURS A DAY THERE AS TO BE SOME DENIAL RIGHT THUE THE'RE OTHER THINGS TO DO IN THE WORLD THERE HAS TO BE SOME AVOIDANCE RAS TO BE SOME RATIONALIZATIONLY SOMETHING IS GOING ON THERE THAT'S NOT HEALTHY SO IF YOU TELL ME THIS PERSON IS UTILIZING SOCIAL MEDIA TEN HOURS A DAY THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THINGS THAT MAKE THEM FEEL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES ARE JUST DOING IT THEN AND I THINK LOOKI SOMETHING IS IS OUT A BAL S NOT MAY BE THAT THAT THAT PERSONS DEFENCES ARE AT A BALANCE SO THINK ABOUT THE EXAMPLE OF THE PERSON ERE THE JOB THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAN THEIR DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE CHANGES THEN THE THING THAT WAS GOOD FOR THEM THEY RELY ON TOO MUCH AND NOW BECOME SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THAT RIGHT SO THEN YOU GO AND LOOK AT WHAT ELSE IS OUT OF BALANCE HERE RIGT WHAT ELSE IS IS IS DRIVING SO MAYBE IT'S BEING DRIVEN BY THE CHANGE IN DEFENCE MACHNISMS ET CETERA MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT THAT THIS PERSON JUST KIND OF HABITUATED TO DOING MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE OF IT AND THEN YOU WOULD COME OUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY OF OKE CAN YOU CAN YOU SLOWLY BUT SURELY DO LESS YOU KNOW REPLACE THAT THE TIME WITH THINGS THAT WERE GOOD BEFORE CUL YOU COULD THEN BACK THAT PERSON OU TO WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE BUT YOU'RE NOT GIN A BACK THE PERSON OU TO WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE IF IT'S BEING DRIVEN BY SOMETHING ELSE SO WE AGAIN COME TO THE CURIOSITY YOU TELL ME THAT PERSON IS ON SOCIAL MEDI FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY I'M CURIOUS RAY I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF THOSE DRIVES RIGHT YOUYOU'VE JUST TOLD ME A VERY POWERFUL POINT ABOUT SALIENTS THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A GOOD ONE SO ALREADY YOU GIVEIM ME CLUES ABOUT WHERE THE DRIVES ARE BY WHICH MES WHERES THAT PERSON AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN ALL THOSE CABINETS THAN YOU GIVE MORE INFORMATION I SIT IN TALK WITH THE PERSON NOW YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT IS TAE LAY OF THE LAND HERE AND HOW DO WE GO ABOUT MAKING IT BETTER I LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE FORT TO ALL BECAUSE IT'S PROSOCIAL IT BRINGS ABOUT GREAT THINGS FOR US AND RFOR THE WORLD THAN MEAN WHAT IS BETTER THAN PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE REMIND OURSELVES OF THOSE AR ACTIVE PHRASES ORE THOSE THOSE CAN BE ACHIEVED IN EXPERIENCE INSIDE OF ACTION IT'S NOT JUST SITTING LEVITATING NAVAL GAZING THAT SORT OF THINGS IT'S NOT ENLIGHTENMENT RIGHT ITS PIECE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT UM VERY BIG DIFFERENCE THERE VERY BY DIFFERENC YES ONE OF THE OTHER REASONS I LOVE THIS CONCEPT OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE SO MUCH IS ALSO BECAUSE IT IS A VERB STATE IT HAS TO DO WITH CREATING THINGS IN US AND IN THE WORLD IN CULTIVATING OUR EXPERIENCE OF THINGS AND AND WHAT WE DO IN WHAT WE SAY AND HOW WE RESPOND TO WHAT OTHERS DO AND SAY AND I ALSO LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S DISTINCT FROM THE WAY THAT WE'RE NORMALLY TAUGHT TO THINK ABOUT PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING ERE BEING A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL WHULD SHOULD USUALLY CENTERS AROUND A DISCUSSION OF GOALS AND VALUES AND YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT AM I TRYNA FOCUS ON AND AND YET WHAT SORTS OF PEOPLE DO I WANT ENGAGE WITH IN THE WORLD AND CERTAINLY ALL OF THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT GOALS AND WHO YOU ENGAGE WITH BUT I THINK FOR MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE MUCH OF THEIR TIME IS SPENT THINKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE HOW HEALTHY ARE WERE UNHEALTHY ARE THE PEOPLE THEIR DATING OR THEIR FRIENDS OR WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN TWO FAMILY MEMBERS YOU KNOW WHICH COURSE S FINE TO THINK ABOUT BUT A LOT OF EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON LIKE OUR ASSESSMENTS OF OTHERS AND HOW THOSE ARE IMPACTING US I'M AND IN SOME CASES PEOPLE DEFAULTS TO JUST THING ABOUT OTHERS AND THEIR PROBLEMS AND SEEING THEIR PROBLEMS AND WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A PROCESS OF INTROSPECTION AND INQUIRY THAT'S VERY STRUCTURED AND AS IT'S BEEN LAID OUT BY YOU YOU KNOW THESE TWO PILLARS STRUCTURE OF SELF FUNCTION OF SELF WITH THESE TEN CUPBOARDS IM THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE A LOT OF CUPBOARDS BUT S WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIRST EPISODE ALL OF THAT FLOWS UP TO THESE VERY SIMPLE RIGHT IDEALS AND CONCEPTS AND ACTION STATES AND WAYS OF BEING AND TO ME THERE'S NOTHING MORE POWERFUL THEN THE STATEMENT THAT WHAT WE ARE ALL SEEKING ARE STATES OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE BECAUSE AGAIN TO GO BACK TO THE ANALOGY OF PHYSICAL FITNESS THERE ARE NOT AN INFINITE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PHYSICAL STATES OR STATES OF FITNESS THAT ONE IM CAN SEEK THER ENDURANCE THEIR STRENGTH REFLEXIBILITY THERE'S DYNAMIC MOVEMENT THERE'S NOW EXPLOSIVENESS THERE SPEED THETHER BUNCH OF EN O SUBTLETIES TO IT BUT YOU'RE IT REALLY SEEMS THAT THE PSYCHE OURSELVES AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH IS REALLY TRACTABLE IF WE TURN THE LENDS AND WE LOOK INWARD YES YES I THINK THAT IT'S UPON A VERY VERY IMPORTANT POINTS WE TALK ABOUT UNDERSTANDING ONESELF AND THE PROCESS OF CHANGE AND I WOULD DESCRIBE THAT AS RATIONAL ASPIRATION SO LETS USE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH EXAMPLE I IF IF I THINK OQ I WANT TO BE HEALTHIERE YOUKNOW I WANT TO HAVE MORE STRENGTH I WANT O HAVE MORE ENDURANCE AND I MIGHT EVEN HAVE IDEAS OF WHAT THAT WOULD BE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO RUN A CERTAIN DISTANCE IN A CERTAIN TIME LIFT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT I'VE AN IDEA OF WHAT THAT IS BUT RATIONAL ASPIRATION IS ROOTED IN OUR PRESENT LIK I'M AWARE THAT THERE'S A ME NOW THAT THAT THAT LIKE ISN'T IN THAT STATE AND I'M AWARE THAT THERE'S HTHINGS AT I'M GOING TO DO TO GET TO THAT STATE AND I'M NOT THAT DREADING THEM IGOLL ATHETHER'LL BE DIFFICULT RIGHT BUT THAT'S O QUET I CAN DO DIFFICULT THINGS I CAN TAKE PRIDE IN DOING DIFFICULT THINGS AND THAT'S HOW WE ALL ACHIEVE THINGS SO I SEE MYSELF IN THE PRESENT ASE OF COURSE GOALS ARE GOOD AND THAT THAT'S TRUE AS LONG AS WE'RE STILL LIVING OUR LIVES IN THE PRESENT BECAUSE OTHERWISE GOALS JUST BECOME FANTASIES OR THINGS WE WANT A WANT TO POSSESS SO IF I'M AWARE OF THE STATE OF PHYSICAL HEALTH I'M IN RIGHT NOW AND I'M AWARE OF THE STATE OF PHYSICAL HALTH I WANT TO BE IN AND I KNOW THERE'S A MUNCH PATHWAYS I CULD TAKE TO GET THERE BUT I'VE TO THINK ABOUT AT BOUT IT FIGURE IT OUT DO THOSE THINGS AND THAT I'M GING TO NAVIGATE MYSELF THERE THAT'S HOW THE WHOLE PROCESS IS GOOD I DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT MYSELF NOW I RECOGNIZE SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE I'M NOT SAYING OR YOU WILL LOSER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS RIH I FEEL GI FEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF NOW I RECOGNIZE THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A PROCESS A PROCESS OF CROSS TIME A CROSS EFFORT THAT'S GON NAVIGATE ME THERE THAN WANT I GET THERE I FEEL GOOD ABOUT BEING THERE IT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT IF I THINK I WANT THAT I WANT TO POSSESS IN A SENTENSE RIGHT I WANT T POSSESS THE ABILITY TO RUN A CERTAIN DISTANCE IN A CERTAIN TIME I JUST WANT THE THING I'M COVETOUS OF THE THING RIGHT THAT IS NOT GOOD RIGHT IS A PERSON THEN OFTEN IS DENEGRATING TO THE CELF NOT ALWAYS BY THIS SEMOTIVATION TO GO OUT AND GET THAT THING THAT'S BETTER AND AND THER THE'RE REALLY IM LAMENTING THE PROCESS OF GETTING THOUGH THEY JUST WANT SOMETHING IS AN END POINT AND THAT DOESNIT MAKE FOR HAPPINESS IT DOES IT MAKE FOR EVEN TE THE HUMILITY AND HUMILITY IN ACTION THE GRATITUDE RIGHT OF THE HUMILITY AS I CAN'T JUST DO THAT OVERNIGHT I'M GAN TO HAVE TO WORK HARD PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK HARD I'M NO DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY ELSE I'M NOT SPECIAL I GOT TO GET IN THERE AND WORK AIN USE THE ELBOW GREASE AND AND I'LL GET HEALTHIER LIKE ALL OF THAT IS GOOD THAT I JUST WANT TO POSSESS SOMETHING IS NOT GOOD AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE IN INSENARIOS LIKE THIS THEY MIGHT LI GO THROUGH MAYBE IN AN UNTHINKING WAY OR THEY'RE GUTTING IT OUT WHERE THEY GOIN TO GET THAT THING RIGHT BUT THEN NOTHING IS NOT ENOUGH RIGHT AND THEY WANT MORE NDNO THERE'S NOT IS NOTHING WRONG WITH WANTING MORE IF IT'S IF IT'S THE HEALTHY ANACTION OF SELF RIT IN IN TO NOW MAP MY WAY THIS FEELS BETTER I WANT TE MAP MYSELF FROM HERE TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF BETTER PHYSICAL FITNESS THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN I JUST WANT THAT THING BECAUSE IN IF I GET IT IT WON'T BE GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT IT DOESN'T MAKE ME HAPPY IT DOESN'T SATISFY ME AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THE UNHEALTHY STATE OF JUST WANTING THINGS TO POSSESS THEM AND THEN WE DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEM WHICH IS EVEN OF THE THOUGHT OF IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE IF YOU GIVE A PERSON SOMETHING THOL RESENT YOU FOR IT RIGHT AGAIN WUD IT THAT WERE WERE PAINTING IN IT ISTOT A CERTAIN WAY THE CONTEXT OF THAT STATEMENT WHICH I USED TO HEAR YOU KNOW A LOT EVEN WHEN I WAS YOUNGER THE PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT RIGHT AND WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO GET AT RIGHT WHAT THEY WERE GETTING AT IS IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD IF YOU DIDN'T WORK FOR SOMETHING RILIC IF YOU NEEDN'T WORK VERY HARD AND YOU HAD A SEE BUT I GIVE YOU AN EGG OR SOMEBODY GIVES ME AN EGG RIGHT I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT GOOD I KNOW THAT I GOT THE THING I GOT THE A AND I MIGHT FEEL HAPPY IN THE MOMENT CAUSE I WANTED THAT THING BUT THERE'S NO REAL PLEASURE IN IT THERE'S NO F SATISFACTION THERE'S NO CONTENT WET THRE'S NO SENSE OF SELF THERE'S NOTHING GENERATIVE I DADN'T WORK HARD ENOUGH TO GO FROM A SEA TO ANAY RIGHT SO IT'S THAT THAT AND THAT REALLY BRINGS US BACK TO TO THE SELF THAT WE'RE GROWING ON TOP OF YU KNOW OF THE STRUCTURE RIGHT AND HOW THAT HOW THAT SELF IS FUNCTIONING I HOW IT'S STRIVING BECAUSE NOW WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT STRIVINGS AND IF I GOING TO STRIVE FOR SOMETHING IN WORK HART TO GET IT WILL I GET THE GOOD FEELING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND NOW WE'RE WE'RE LIVING IN THE GENERATIVE SPACE WELL I LOVE THE STRUCTURE OF WHAT YOU'VE LAID OUT AGAIN THINK YOU THE PILLARS OF STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF WITH TEN CUPBOARDS BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM THAT WHEN EXPLORED CAN SEEM A LO BIT COMPLEX BUT THERE REALLY SOME VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD TYPES OF INQUIRY THAT ANY ONE CAN GO ABOUT ABOUT SELF AWARENESS AND ADDRESS PODENTIAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS WHAT WE'RE CONSCIOUS OF MAY BE WHAT WE'RE NOT CONSCIOUS OF LOOK AT OUR BEHAVIORS AN OUR STRIVINGS AND HOW THAT FLOWS UP TO THESE SIMPLE IDEALS AGAIN OF EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENCY IN DRATITUDE AS VERBS AND THEN FROM THAT PIECE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT AND THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WHICH GOSHI I THERE EVER WAS A A MORE POWERFUL CONCEPT AND SOMETHING TO STRIVE FOR I I I DON'T THINK IT EXISTS BECAUSE SOM THE GENEROVE DRIVE IS AT IS EXTRAORDINARY AND IN THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS IT PLACE OUT AND IT SEEMS ALWAYS POSITIVELY RIGHT UM AND OF COURSE THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THE PLEASURE DRIVE EXISTS O VARYING EXTENSE IN ALL OF US BUT U CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO OVERCOME THE GENER OFE DRIVE IF WE'RE GOING TO TO REALLY THRIVE SO EM SO THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH FOR THIS FRAME WORK AND AGAIN TO REMIND PEOPLE LISTENING AND WATCHING THAT OF THIS FRAMEWORK IS IS

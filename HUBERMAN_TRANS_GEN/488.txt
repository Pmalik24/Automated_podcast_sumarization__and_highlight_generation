WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAONANS  A SCIENCE SCIENCE BASE TO S RIN THE I MANDRHUBERMEN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NAUROBOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE'RE TALKING ALL ABOUT GOALS AND THE SCIENCE OF GOAL SETTING AND ACHIEVING YOUR GOALS IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON THE INTERNED AND IN GOOKS AND SO FORTH ABOUT HOW TO SET GOALS AND ASSESS YOUR PROGRESS TOWARDS GOALS AND UPDATE YOURE GOALS AND SO FORTH IN FACT THERE'S SO MANY PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT INCLUDE SO MANY DIFFERENT ACRONYMS THAT IT CAN BE A LOBIT OVERWHELMING TO DAY'S CONVERSATION ABOUT GOALS IS GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT INDEED WE ARE GOING TIONT TALK ABOUT SETTING GOALS WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO ASSESS PROGRESS TOWARDS GOALS AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT GOAL EXECUTION HOWEVER WE ARE GOING TO DO ALL OF THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF NAURO SCIENCE BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE NOT HUNDREDS OR DOZENS OR EVEN SEVERAL NAURO CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT CONTROL GOAL SETTING AND MOVEMENT TOWARD YOUR GOALS THERE IS ONE AND WHILE IT INCLUDES MANY DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS THAT ONE CIRCUIT IS THE SAME CIRCUIT THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR PURSUING ALL GOALS AND IT RELATES TO SOME VERY BASIC NEUROCHEMICAL MECHANISMS THAT ARE UNDERSTOOD SO WHILE THERE'S A WEALTH OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT GOALS AND GOAL SETTING AND BGAL ACHIEVEMENT AND SO FORTH THERE'S COMPARATIVELY LITTLE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE NAURO SCIENCE OF GOAL SETTING AND GOAL ACHIEVEMENT SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOIN O FOCUS ON TODAY I PROMISE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE NAURO SCIENCE WE'REGOING O TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT OF THE PSYCHOLOGY AND HOW THE NAURO SCIENCE RELATES TO WHAT'S KNOWN IN THE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE AND WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH SEVERAL IN FACT FOUR SPECIFIC PROTOCALS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR GOAL SETTING GOAL ASESSMENT AND GOAL EXECUTION IN AN ONGOING BASIS REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR PERSONAL GOALS HAPPEN TO BE BEFORE WE DIVE INTO OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT GOALS AND GOAL SETING AND GOAL ACHIEVEMENT LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME RECENT SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTING AND ACTIONABLE FOR MANY OF YOU OUT THERE IN EARLIER PODCASTS WE TALKED ABOUT NAURO PLASTICITY WHICH IS THE BRAINSABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE IN FACT NEURO PLASTICITY UNDERLIES ALL FORMS OF LEARNING WHETHER NOT'S LANGUAGE LEARNING OR LEARNING MUSIC OR MATH OR PHYSICAL SKILL ALL FORMS OF LEARNING IN VOLVE THE REORGANIZATION OF CONNECTIONS IN THE NERVOUS SISTEM THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD AND BODY ONE OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES OF NAURO PLASTICITY IS THIS NOTION OF MAKING ERRORS AS A GOOD THING TOWARD NAURO PLASTICITY IS A LUBIC COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TELLS US IS THAT WHENEVER WE'RE TRING TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW IF WE MAKE AN ERROR WE KNOW IT FEELS FRUSTRATING BUT THAT STATE OF FRUSTRATION ACTUALLY CUSE UP PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS TO BE MORE ALERT SO THAT ON SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO LEARN THAT THING WE HAVE A HEIGHTEND LEVEL OF FOCUS AND A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF LEARNING THE NEW SKILL REGARDLESS OF WHAT TH T SKILL IS NOW TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE IN VARIOUS EPISODES AS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO EMBRACE ERRORS OR PURSUE ERRORS NOT AS THEIR OWN ENGOAL BUT ERRORS AS AN ENTRY POINT FOR MAKING THE BRAIN MORE PLASTIC AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT REALLY MAKE SENSE WHY WOULD THE BRAIN CHANGE AT ALL IF IT'S PERFORMING EVERYTHING PERFECTLY WHEN YOU MAKE ERRORS WELL IN THE IMMEDIATE SECONDS AND MINUTES AFTER THOSE ERRORS YOU ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO LEARN A COMMON QUESTION I GET HOWEVER IS WHAT SHOULD BE THE RATE OF ERRORS WHICH IS REALLY JUST A WAY OF SAYING HOW HARD SHOULD THE GIVEN TASK BE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN OR PERFORM AND IT TURNS OUT THERE'S AN ANSWER THERE'S A RECENT PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISH IN A GREAT JOURNAL NATURE COMMUNICATIONS THIS IS A PAPER A LAST AUTHOR JONATHAN COEN AND THE PAPERIS ENTITLED THE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT RULE FOR OPTIMAL LEARNING THIS PAPER WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE BY A LINK IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS BUT BASICALLY WHAT THIS PAPER SHOWS IS THAT WHEN TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW YOU WANT TO MAKE THE DIFFICULTY OF WHAT YOURE TRYING TO LEARN SUCH THAT YOU ARE GETTING THINGS RIGHT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TIME THAT YOU'RE MAKING ERRS ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE TIME AND THE REASON I LIKE THIS PAPER IS IT REALLY POINT SPECIFICALLY TO SOME PROTOCALS THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY O K YOU WANT AS SET HIGH GOAL YOU WANT TO TRYING TO CHIEVE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY LOFTY BE DONT WANT TO MAKE THE GOAL SO LOFTY THAT YOU DON'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS AT ALL OTHER PEOPLE SAY YOU REALLY WANT TO START WITH REALLY SMALL GOALS AND MAKE THINGS VERY VERY INCREMENTAL ONLY SET OUT TO DO THINGS THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH AND THAT WILL FEED BACK ON YOUR SELF ESTEEM AND ALL THESE POSITIVE FEE BACK LOOPES AND THEN YOU KNOW LAYER BY LAYER LAYER BY LAYER YOUILL VENTUALLY GET WHAT YOU WANT TO GO WHAT TURNS OUT THAT NEITHER IS TRUE YOU NEED TO SET THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY SUCH THAT YOU'R MAKING ERRORS ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE TIME AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE TIME BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO O FIGUR PROOTOCALLS FOR SPORT OR LANGUAGE OR MATH OR ANYTHING ELSE WHERE YOUR GOING TO HAVE EXACTLY FIFTEEN PER CENT ERRORS SO ANYWAY THIS PAPER THE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT RULE FOR OPTIMAL LEARNING AGAIN WE WILL SUPPLY THE LINK BUT IT REALLY POINTS THE IDEA OF MAKING THINGS PRETTY HARD BUT NOT SO HARD THAT YOU'R FAILING EVERY ATTEMPT OR EVEN HALF OF THE ATTEMPTS FAILING ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE TIME SEEMS OPTIMAL FOR LEARNING HOPEULY THAT INFORMATION WILL BE USEFUL TO ANY OF YOU THAT ARE TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHING FULLY IT WILL ALSO BE USEFUL TO THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE TEACHING KIDS OR OTHER ADULTS IF YOUR TEACHING KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP THE STUDENTS REACHING FOR HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS OF PRERFICIENCY IN WHATEVER THAT IS THAT YOUR TEACHING AND THAT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE TIME THEY SHOULD BE FAILING IF IT GETS TO TWENTY PER CENT THAT'S PROBABLY OKE IF THEY START FAILING ABOUT HALF THE TIME THAN PROBABLY WHAT THE'RE TRYING TO LEARN IS TOO DIFFICULT FOR THEM AT THAT POINT NOW OF COURSE THIS IS GOING TO BE CONTROL BY ALL SORTS OF EXTERNAL FACTORS LIKE WHETHER NOT THEY SLEPT WELL THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH A NOT YOU SLEP WELL THE NIGHT BEFORE IN YOURE BEING CLEAR IN YOUR INSTRUCTIONS A TO THEM ET CETERA BUT I THINK THE FIFTEEN PER CENT RULE AS WE MAY CALL IT IS A GOOD METRIC TO AIM FOR AND AT CONSERVE BOTH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AND OTHER WORDS IT CAN SERVE BOTH THOSE TEACHING AND THOSE THAT ARE LEARNING BEFORE WEU BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHISIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC

KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH

SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEI'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOT COM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND IN PARTICULAR THE BIOLOGY AND NEURAL SCIENCE OF SETTING AND ACHIEVING GOALS SETTING AN ACHIEVING GOALS IS NOT A UNIQUELY HUMAN ENDEAVOR OTHER ANIMALS SET AND ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE GOALS A HONEY BE ATTEMPTS TO COLLECT HONEY AND BRING IT BACK TO THE HIVE A URBIVOR WILL GO OUT AND FORAGE FOR PLANTS AND WILL ALSO HAVE A NEED TO REPRODUCE IT SOME POINT IN ITS LIFE SO WILL NEED TO FIND A MATE AND MAYBE EVEN RAISE THE YOUNG DEPENDING ON WHAT SPECIES THAT IS PREDITORS WILL HAVE TO HUNT AND KILL AND EAT THEIR FOOD AND THEY HAVE TO AVOID GETTING INJURED IN THAT PROCESS THEY ELSO HAVE TO RAISE YOUNG ET CETERA SO HUMANS ARE AMONG THE OTHER ANIMALS OR WE COULD SAY THE ANIMALS ARE AMONG US IN THE NEED TO SET GOALS AND TO MAKE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THOSE GALS NOW WHY DO I EMPHASIZE THIS COMMONALITY OF PROCESS THE REASON I EMPHASIZE THIS COMMONALITY OF PROCESS IS THAT IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS ONE BASIC SYSTEM BY WHICH ALL ANIMALS INCLUDING HUMANS SET AN ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE GOALS NOW HUMANS ARE UNIQUE IN OUR ABILITY TO ORIENT OUR MIND TOWARD IMMEDIATE GOALS MODERATELY TERMED GOALS MEANING THINGS THAT MIGHT EXIST ON THE SCALE OF A WEAKUE OR A MONTH OR EVEN A YEAR AND VERY LONG TERM GOALS LIKE A LIFETIME GOAL OR A GOAL THAT LASTS A DECADE OR TAKES A DECADE TO ACHIEVE THAT'S WHAT MAKES US UNIQUE AND OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE MIND SET OR R THE THINKING OR THE EMOTIONS OF OTHER ANIMALS BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT COMMON NURL CIRCUITS MEANING BRAIN AREAS THAT AR PRESENT IN ANIMAL SPECIES AND IN HUMANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ORIENTING ORE THINKING AND OUR ACTION TOWARD PARTICULAR GOALS ANOTHER THING THAT'S REALLY UNIQUE ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE MULTIPLE GOALS INTERACTING AT ONCE SO FOR INSTANCE WE PROBABLY ALL HAVE FITNESS GOALS GOALS IN RELATIONSHIPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS FRIENDSHIPS AND ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIPS AS WELL AS MAYBE SCLASTIC GOALS MAYBE MAYBE ARE IN SCHOOL YOUR PURSUING SOME KIND OF LEARNING OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT OR AND OR YOU HAVE BUSINESS GOALS OR FINANCIAL GOALS WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE MULTIPLE GOALS AT ONCE ANOTHER ANIMALS DO THIS BUT HUMANS ARE UNIQUE IN THE ABILITY TO JUGGLE A LOT OF GOALS AND A SHALLY ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES IN PURSUING GOALS IS THAT GOAL PURSUIT OFTEN INTERRACTS MEANING IF YOU CAN SPEND ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF YOUR TIND CHASING ONE PARTICULAR GOAL THAT MIGHT BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR THAT GOAL BUT THEN WE TEND TO FALL BACK ON SOME OF OUR OTHER GOALS AH YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT IF YOUR WORKING VERY VERY HARD ON YOUR SOLLY FOCUSSD ON BUSINESS OFTEN YOUR HEALTH WILL SUFFER IF YOUR SOLELY FOCUSTD ON YOUR HEALTH OFTEN OTHER THINGS WILL SUFFER AND SO WE HAVE TO JUGGLE BOTH OUR GOAL SETTING AND OUR GOAL PURSUITS AND TODAYS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO WORK WITH WHAT COULD VERY WELL BE CALL THESE INTER LEAVING GOALS BY FOCUSING ON A COMMON PRACTISE ER COMMON SET OF MECHANISMS THAT ARE PRESENT IN ALL ASPECTS OF GOAL SEEKING WHAT IS THAT PROCESS WHAT TURNS OUT IT'S A NURL CIRCUIT A NURL CIRCUIT IS SIMPLY A COLLECTION OF BRAIN AREAS THAT WHEN ACTIVE IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENTS GIVE RISE TO A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR OR PERCEPTION SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU FEEL HALF BY IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BRAIN AREA THATS THE HAPPY BRAIN AREA THAT IS ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE RATHER IT'S GOING TO INVOLVE NUMEROUS BRAIN AREAS BEING ACTIVE IN CONCERT AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE KEYS ON A PIANO TOGETHER PLAYED IN THE APPROPRIATE SEQUENTS REPRESENT A PARTICULAR SONG YOU WOULD NEVER SAY THAT ONE KEY ON THE PIANO REPRESENTS THAT SONMG BUT THAT KEY IS NECESSARY SIMILARLY IN THE BRAIN WE CAN SAY THAT A BRAIN AREA MIGHT BE NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO GIVE US A PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE OR GENERATE O PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GOAL SEEKING AND THE PURSUIT OF GOALS OF ANY KIND IN THE BRAIN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE GOAL IS IT INVOLVES A COMMON SET OF NERL CIRCUITS AND THE NERAL CIRCUIT THAT I LIKE TO ORIENT US TOWARD TO DAY AND WEILL RETURN TO IT A FEW TIMES INVOLVES LEARNING A COUPLE OF NAMES BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT MEMORIZING THESE JUST MORE IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC OF HOW IT'S PUT TOGETHER AND I WILL EXPLAIN THAT AND MAKE IT VERY CLEAR IF YOU WANT TO LEARN THE NAMES THATS GREAT ONE OF THE RAIN AREAS IS THE SO CALLED AMIGDOLA THE IMIGULA'S MOST OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH FEAR S YOU MIGHT SAY WHILE HOW IS THAT INVOLVED IN GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR WELL A LOT OF OUR GOAL DIRECTEID BEHAVIOR IS TO AVOID PUNISHMENTS INCLUDING THINGS LIKE EMBARRASSMEN OR FINANCIAL RUIN OR THINGS OF THAT SORT AND SO THE IMIGDULA AND SOME SENSE OF ANXXIETY OR FEAR IS ACTUALLY BUILT IN TO THE CIRCUITS THAT GENERATE GOAL SEEKING AND OUR MOTIVATION TO PURSUIT GOALS THE OTHER AREAS ARE THE SO CALED VENCIAL STRIATUM THE STRIATUM IS PART OF WHAT'S CALLED THE BAZIL GANGLIA THE BAZI GANGLIA IS A NERAL CIRCUIT THAT CAN VERY SIMPLY BE DESCRIBED AS A NERAL CIRCUIT THAT HELPS US GENERATE GO MEANING THE INITIATION OF ACTION AND NO GO THE PREVENTION OF ACTION TYPE SENAREOS LET ME MAKE THAT EVEN SIMPLER THE VENTUAL STRIATUM IS PART OF THE TIN CALLED THE BAZIO GANGLIAT THE BAZO GANGLIA HAS SORT OF TWO CIRCUITS WITHIN IT ONE CIRCUIT IS INVOLVED IN GETTING US TO DO THINGS LIKE I'M GOIN TO GET UP TO MORROW AND O'MEN A RUN FIVE MILES FIRST THING IN THE MORNING ON'T NO HOWMASHICAN TO DO THAT BHUT I'M JUSUSING S AN EXAMPLE ANOTHER CIRCUIT WITHIN THE BAZO GANGLE IS A NOGO CIRCUIT IS SO ONE THAT SAYS NO I'M NOT GOING TO GO FOR THE SECOND COKI OR THE THIRD COOKI I'M NOT GOING TO EAT THAT AND THEN THE GO CIRCUIT WOULD BE THE ONE THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR INSTEAD EATING SOMETHING ELSE OCASE WE HAVE GO AND NOGO CIRCUITS WITHIN THE BAZIL GANGLEAS WE GET A MIGDOLA STHINK OF HIS CONIFER AND ANXIETY AND AVOIDANCE WE'VE GOT THE BAZIL GANGLIO WHICH ARE FOR INITIATING ACTION AND PREVENTING ACTION AND THEN THERE IS THE SO CALLED QUARTEX THE QUARTEX OF THE OUTER SHELL OF THE BRAIN AND THEIR TWO SUBREGIONS OF THE QUARTEX THAT ARE INVOLVED IN GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR ONE IS THE LATERAL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX PREFRONTOL QUARTEX IS INVOLVED IN SO CALLED EXECUTIVE FUNCTION THINGS LIKE PLANNING THINKING ABOUT THINGS UNDER DIFFERENT TIME SCALES ON NOT JUST WHAT WE WANT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM BUT WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY AND HOW OUR ACTIONS CURRENTLY ARGAN A RELATE TO THE FUTURE AND THE SO CALLED ORBIDO FRONTOL QUARTEX HORBIDO FRONT OF QUARTEX HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS BUT ONE OF THE KEY FUNCTIONS OF THE ORBITOR FRONTAL QUARTECX ITS IS INVOLVED IN NESHING SOME EMOTIONALITY WITH OUR CURRENT STATE OF PROGRESS AND COMPARING THAT EMOTIONALITY TO WHERE WE IT MIGHT BE WHEN WE OR CLOSER TO A GOAL OKE SO THEIRE BASELY FOUR AREAS ONE INVOLVED IN ANXIETY ONE INVOLVED IN EMOTION ONE INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND ANOTHER INVOLVED IN THIS GO NOGOAL ACTION SO THAT'S A BUNCH OF DETAIL BUT IF I WANTED TO MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE FOR EVERYONE I WOULD SAY THERE ARE FOUR AREAS ONE IS IN AREA ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND FEAR SEE AMAGULLA THE SECOND IS INVOLVED IN ACTION AND INACTION REMEMBER GO AND NOGO SO THAT'S THE BASOGANGLIA THE OTHER ONE IS INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND THINKING ACROSS DIFFERENT TIMESCALES SO THAT'S LATERAL PEFRONTAL QUARTE AND THEN THE FOURTH ONE IS INVOLVED IN EMOTIONALITY WHERE WE SIT EMOTIONALLY AT PRESENT COMPARED TO WHERE WE THINK WE WILL BE EMOTIONALLY WHEN WE REACH SOME PARTICULAR GAL AND THAT'S THE ORBIT OR FRONTAL QUARTEX OKE AGAIN YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ALL THOSE NAMES YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ALL THE DETAILS JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESSIES THAT LEAD US TOWARD PARTICULAR GOALS AND HAVE US UPDATE OUR GOAL SEEKING ET CETERA ONE KEY THING AS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE GOAL IS THE SAME CRCUITS ARE INVOAL SO WHETHER NOT YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD A COMPANINE THAT'STHE BUILDING NOLLOR COMPANY THAT'S CONNAGRE PUBLIC ORR YOUR THINKING ABOUT PLANNING A CRAFTS DAY AT HOME WITH THE KIDS OR FOR YOURSELF OR YOUR THING ABOUT WHAT MOVI TAGO SEE GOALS GOAL SEEKING AND ASSESSING PROGRESS TOWARDS GOALS ALL INVOALL THE EXACT SAME NERAL CIRCUITS IS REALY REMARKABLE THALSO VERY CONVENIENT FOR OUR DISCUSSION TODAY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THESE CIRCUITS CAN BASICALLY BE BOILED DOWN TO TWO PARTICULAR THINGS THE FIRST IS VALUE INFORMATION TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER R NOT SOMETHING IS REALLY WORTH PURSUING OR NOT SO PLACING O VALUE ON A PARTICULAR GOL THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THIS NERAL CIRCUIT IS ASSOCIATED WITH ACTION WHICH ACTIONS TO TAKE AND WHICH ACTIONS NOT TO TAKE GIVEN THE VALUE OF A PARTICULAR GOAL IN A GIVEN MOMENTS TIME ONE SAY THAT AGAIN THE OTHER COMPONET OF THE CIRCUIT IS INVOLVED IN ACTION WHETHER NOT YOU SHOULD ACT OR SHOULD NOT ACT BASED ON YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE VALUE OF A GOAL AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME AND I YOU'REGOIN TO HEAR ME SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THIS EPISODE THE VALUE INFORMATION ABOUT A GOAL IS SO KEY HER'S WHY THERE IS BASICALLY ONE NEURAL TRANSMITTER OR RATHER NEUROMODULATOR SYSTEM THAT GOVERNS OUR GOAL SETTING GOAL ASSESSMENT INGOAL PURSUIT AND THAT IS THE NEUROMODULATOR DOPOMINE DOPOMIN IS THE COMMON CURRENCY BY WHICH WE ASSESS OUR PROGRESS TOWARD PARTICULAR THINGS OF PARTICULAR VALUE IN FACT DOPAMINE IS THE WAY THAT WE ASSESS VALUE OF OUR PURSUITS AND SO WE TAKE A MOMENT AND WE SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GOAL SETTING THINGS THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD A BIT MORE ABOUT ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF GOALS ARE GOOD AND HAW TO SET GOALS AND HOW TO CATEGRIZE GOALS I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW DOPAMINE COULD POSSIBLY BE INVOLVED IN THESE DIFFERENT PROCESSES AND THE REASON I WANT YOU TO DO THIS IS THAT ALL OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GOAL SETTING IN GOAL PURSUIT IS WONDERFUL BECAUSE IT PLACES THINGS INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IT ALLOWS US TO PARSE OUR THINKING AND ORGANIZE OUR THINKING BUT WHAT'S NOT OFTEN SEE IN FACT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY LITERATURE OUT THERE SCIENTIFIC OR LITERATURE IN THE POPULAR PRESS ARE IN POPULAR BOOKS IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE UNDERLYING NAUROBIOLOGY CAN BE LAIRED ON TOP OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GOAL SETTING TO ALLOW US TO SET AND PURSUE OUR GOALS MORE EFFECTIVELY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOIN TO DO TO DAY WE ARE EVENTUALLY GOING TO ARRIVE AT A SET OF FOUR PRACTICES THAT WHEN PERFORMED ON A REGULAR BASIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO ASSESS WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THIS NEXT PARTICULAR ACTION STEP HOW WORTH WHILE IS IT TO TO BEHAVIOUR AVERSIS BEHAVIOUR BE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OR PARTICULAR GOAL IF ANY OF THIS IS VAGUE NOW I'M GOING TO MAKE IT ALL VERY CLEAR FOR YOU YOU'RE GOING TO COME AWAY WITH SOME VERY SPECIFIC LISTS OF TAKE AWAYS THAT YOU CAN PUT DOWN ON PAPER IF YOU LIKE AND THAT YOU CAN USE TO SET GOALS ASESS GOALS AND EXECUTE GOALS MORE EFFECTIVELY USING THE NORRW SCIENCE OF THE CIRCUITS I JUST DESCRIBED AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE NARMODULATOR DOPOME LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GOAL SETTING IN GOAL PURSUIT THIS IS AN ENORMOUS LITERATURE MEANING THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ABOUT THE TOPIC OF GOAL SETTING AND GOAL PURSUIT ALSO A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET ABOUT GOAL PURSUIT AND IN LOOKING OVER THIS INFORMATION ONE COMES TO APPRECIATE PRETTY QUICKLY THAT ACRONYMS ARE A BIG THING ACRONYMS SEEM TO DOMINATE THE AREA OF GOAL SETTING ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THINGS IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR BUT ALSO IN THE RELATIONSHIP SECTOR NOW ACRNYMS ARE WONDERFUL THEY ALLOW US TO ORGANIZE OUR THINKING INTO LISS AND CONCEPTIALLY THEY CAN BE VERY USEFUL BUT AS I MOVED THROUGH THIS LITERATURE I START TO SEE SOME REDUNDANT THEMES AND SO WHAT IHAVE ATTEMPTED TO DO IS DISTILL OUT THE REDUNDANT THEMES THAT REGARDLESS OF THE PERSON TEACHING OR THE SCIENTIFIC LABORATORY THAT HAPPEN TO COME UP WITH UM THESE ACRONYMS THAT THEY BOIL DOWN TO SOME COMMON FEATURES SO THET'S TALK ABOUT THAT LITERATURE AND I THINK WE'LL COME AWAY WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF SOME BASIC ELEMENTS THAT ARE COMMON TO ALL GOALS NOW THE MODERN SCIENCE OR THE MODERN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE OF CHINA UNDERSTAND GOAL SETTING AND PURSUIT AS SHE DATES BACK TO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT MEMBERS OF OUR SPECIES WERE FOCUST ON GOAL SETTING IN GAL PURSUIT LONG BEFORE THIS SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE EMERGED IT JUST STANDS TO REASON THAT SINCE THE HUMAN BRAIN HASN'T EVOLVE THAT MUCH WE DON'T THING IN THE LAST TEN THOUSAND YEARS THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS THEY JUST DIDN'T GET THEM DOWN NTO PAPERS THAT WE CAN AVALUATE ON PUBMET AND SO FORTH BUT NOW WE CAN SO WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE PAPERS ND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT ACRANYMS ABOUND IN THE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE ABOUT GOAL SETTING IN GOAL PURSUIT SO FOR INSTANCE YHOU HEARABOUT A THE WORK OF A LOCK AN SMALL FOR INSTANCE THES OF THE LAST NAMES OF A VARIOUS A RESEARTURES THE SO CALLED A B C METHOD THAT A GOAL SHOULD BE ACHIEVABLE IT SHOULD BE BELIEVABLE AND THAT THE PERSEON BE COMMITTED IT SORT OF OBVIOUS ONE TO HEAR BUT THE A B C METHOD THEN PEOPLE CAME ALONG AND EXPANDED ON THAT THEY TALK ABOU THE SO CALLED SMART METHOD SMART BEING ANOTHER ACRNYM THAT IT BE SPECIFIC THAT THE GOAL BE MEASURABLE THAT THE GOAL BE ATTAINABLE THAT THE GOAL BE REALISTIC AND THAT IT BE TIMEBOUND MEANG THAT YOU SET A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH A GIVEN GOAL SHOULD BE PERFORMED AND THEN PEOPLE COME ALONG AND MODIFY THESE THIS IS TWAY THAT PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH IS DONE I 'M NOT LAUGHING AT IT I'M JUST CHUCKLING BECAUSE OMETHIT SEEMS LIKE THE ACARNYMS GET LONGER AND LONGER AND LONGER AM THEY DEVELOPED THE SMART UR APPROACH ADDING IN E ARE TO THE ACRONYM SMART TO ESEM A ART E ARE THEY ADDED ETHICAL AND REWARDING WHICH FORTUNATELY O ARE GOOD THINGS I BELIEVE ETHICAL AND REWARDING A WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN WELL WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT ANY KIND OF GOAL PURSUIT ANY KIND OF GOAL SETTING REALLY HAS TO INVOLVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATES AND NERAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I VIEW THIS LITERATURE WHY WOULD I DO THAT WELL WHATS THING ABOUT THE VERY MODERN VERSION OF THE KIND OF ACRANYMS THAT I TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO DATING BACK TO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND EXTENDING INTO THE NINETEEN NINETIES YOU CAN FIND BEAUTIFUL TALKS ON LINE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED WITH SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES AND GREATEST HYGH PERFORMERS OUT THERE TO ACHIEVE INCREDIBLE THINGS AND THEY WILL TALK ABOUT GENERATING A SORT OF OBJECTIVE MINE SET FOR GOAL SETTING THEYLL TALK ABOUT GOALS NEEDING TO BE SIGNIFICANT AS TO BE A BIG GOAL THAT HAS TO BE CONCRETE E HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DSCRIBE WHAT THE GOAL IS IT HAS TO BE ACTION ORIENTED HAS TO BE INSPIRATIONAL HAS TO BE TIME BOUND YOU HAVE TO HAVE REASONABLE REALISTIC VERIFIABLE MEASURES YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY UP THE ANTI IF IT STRYING TO SOUND REPETITIVE IT'S BECAUSE IT IS REPETITIVE THERE ARE BASIDLY ONLY THREE OR FOUR ELEMENTS TO GOAL SETTING IN GOAL PURSUIT BASICALLY AN INDIVIDUAL OR SET OF INDIVIDUALS HAS TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC THING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ATTAIN IN SOME  COMMUNITIES THA TALK ABOUT KNOWING WHAT RIGHT LOOKS LIKE MEANING BE BEING ABLE TO DEFINE A VERY SPECIFIC GOAL YOU CAN'T JUST SAY YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE A CHAMPION ATHLETE YOU HAVE TO SAY WHAT SPORT AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PATH TO THAT IS SO ANY BIG GOAL OF COURSE IS BROKEN UP INTO A SERIES OF SMALLER GOALS BUT THE WHOLE THING STARTS WITH THINKING ABOUT THE END IN MIND AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHETHER NOT VISUALIZATION OF THE END IN MINE IS ACTUALLY BENEFICIAL OR DETRIMENTAL TO ACHIEVING GOALSARS ACTUALY GREAT NERAL SCIENCE IN PSY CHOLOGY DATA ON THAT NOW SO I MENTION ALL THESE ACRNYMS NOT AS AN ATTEMPT TO DESPARAGE THEM I THINK THEY'RE WONDERFUL AND I MENTION ALL THAT PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE N OT IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISPARAGE IT BUT RATHER TOLD JUST SAY THAT GOAL SETTING IS THE FIRST STEP A SESSMENT OF WHAT WHETHER NOT ONE IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THOSE GOALS IS A SECOND BUT NECESSARY STEP AND THEN THERE'S THE BUSINESS OF GOAL EXECUTION AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE NARL CIRCUIT COMPONENTS REMEMBER THIS NERL CIRCUIT INVOLVING THOSE FOUR THINGS EARLYER THE MIGLASTRIDUM OVER FRONT OF QUARTEX AND THE PREFRONTOQUARTEX THEY WORK TOGETHER TO DIVIDE THE WHOLE PROCESS AS I MENTION BEFORE INTO TWO GENERAL CATEGORIES THE FIRST IS ASSESSING VALUE KNOWING WHETHER NOT WHERE ONE IS THAT ONE GIVEN MOMENT RELATES TO SOME EXTERNAL THING ARE THINGS GOING WELL OR A THINGS GOING POORLY AND KNOWING HOW TO GAUGE THAT ACCURATELY AND THEN ACTION STEPS GOES AND NOW GOES DO MORE OF THIS DO LESS OF THAT DO THIS DON'T DO THAT ET CETERA SO NOW WE ARE GOIN TO SHIFT BACK TO THE NARROW SCIENCE AND WE'RE IN A TALK ABOUT THE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE INFORMATION I JUST DESCRIBE BECAUSE I'VE GOVING YOU A LOT OF KIND OF ACADEMIC INFORMATION AND AS WE DO THIS INLIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU'VE EITHER ACCOMPLISHED OR THAT YOU LIKE TO ACCOMPLISH GOING FORWARD BECAUSE AS WE DO THIS WE CAN BUILD TOWARDS A SET OF PROTOCALS THAT AT THE END YOU'LL BE ABLE TO VERY QUICKLY PLUG IN YOUR PARTICULAR GOALS AND A ROUTE TO THOSE PARTICULAR GOALS THAT'S GROUNDED IN THE SCIENCE THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN ALLOWING YOU TO REACH THOSE GOALS MORE QUICKLY AND WITH INDEED LESS EFFORT IN FACT LET'S START WITH A TOOL NOW BECAUSE AS WE MOVE THROUGH ALL THIS INFORMATION I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING AWAY WITH SOME PRACTICAL THINGS THAT THEY CAN IMPLEMENT AND INDEED SOMETHINGS THAT YOU CAN EVEN DO DURING THE COURSE OF LISTENING TO OR WATCHING THIS PODCAST THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERRY PERSONAL SPACE AND EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE PERRY PERSONAL SPACE IS ALL THE SPACE LITERALLY THAT WITHIN SIDE YOUR BODY THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN AND IN YOUR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT PRRY PERSONAL SPACE IS A KEY CONCEPT IN NARROW SCIENCE BECAUSE YOU HAVE PARTICULAR NARRL CIRCUITS AND PARTICULAR CHEMICALS THAT ARE GEARED TOWARD WHAT ARE ALLED CONSUMATORY BEHAVIORS MEANING USING THINGS IN CONSUMING THINGS AND ENJOYING THINGS THAT ARE IN YOUR IMMEDIATE PERRY PERSONAL SPACE LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THIS FOR MYSELF JUST TO MAKE IT CONCRETE YOU CAN IMAGINE SIMILAR EXAMPLES FOR YOURSELF RIGHT NOW WITHIN MY CURRENT PERRY PERSONAL SPACE IS MY INTERROCEPTION MY UNDERSTANDING OR PERCEPTION OF MY INTERNAL BODY SO HOW QUICKLY ON BREATHING MY HEART RAITE THE FEELINGS ON THE SURFACE OF MY SKIN ET CETERA BUT ALSO WITHIN THE CONFINES OF MY PERRY PERSONAL SPACE IS THIS COFFEE MUG THAT IF YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS YOU CAN'T SEE THIS BUT I'M LIFTIN LIFTING UP A COFFEE MYGAMATACE US OF ACOFFEE IT'S A CONSUMATORY BEHAVIOR I HAVE THE COFFEE I DON'T HAVE TO DO MUCH OR MODE OF ATE MUCH TO GET IT I HAVE OTHER THINGS HERE APENDSINCAPUTER ET CETERA O KE SO THINGS IN YOUR PERRY PERSONAL SPACE AND CONSUMING THOSE THINGS IS GENERALLY GOVERNED BY A SET OF NEROCHEMICALS TH AT CENTERE AROUND THE NEUROMODULATOR CERATONAN AND THEIRE A FEW OTHERS AS WELL THINGS LIKE OXITOSIN BUT MAINLY CERETONA CONTRAST THAT WITH THE SO CALLED EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE IS EVERYTHING BEYOND THE CONFINES OF MY REACH ITWOULD BE SOMETHING IN THE NEXT ROOM IT WILD BE SOMETHING DOWN THE STREET IT WILD BE SMETHING AT SOME OTHER LOCATION IN SPACE AND TIME AND THE NEUR MODULATORS AN NEUROCHEMICALS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KIND OF THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE ARE DISTINCT FROM THE NARROW CHEMICALS AND NUROMODULATORS THAT INVOLVED IN THINKING ABOUT OR MAKING ACTIONS TOWARDS THE PERRY PERSONAL SPACE AND THE MOLECULE THAT'S MOST ASSOCIATED WITH THINKING ABOUT OR ORIENTING TOWARD THE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE AGAIN THINGS BEYOND THE CONFINES OF MY SKIN OR YOUR SKIN IS DOPAMY AND THIS IS A VITALLY IMPORTANT CONCEPT UNDERSTAND WHEN YOUR SETTING GOALS AND SEEKING GOALS IF WE ARE TO BE GOOD AT GOAL SEEKING IF WE ARE TO BE GOOD AT SETTING GOALS AND ACSESSING GOALS IF WE ARE TO ACHIIVE OUR GOALS WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TOGGAL BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERRY PERSONAL SPACE WHAT WE HAVE AND HOW WE FEEL IN THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT AND OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE AND OUR ABILITY TO MOVE INTO THAT EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE AND A SIMPLE WAY TO CONCEIVE OF ALL THIS IS THAT WE EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS IN THE PERRY PERSONAL SPACE WE AVALUATE HOW WE FEEL ABOUT SOME PURSUIT EVEN IF WE HAVE AN INITIATED THAT PURSUIT YET HOW WE FEEL ABOUT A PARTICULAR GOAL IS TRULY A FEELING THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN THE HERE AND NOW EVEN THOUGH THE GOAL IS IN THE FUTURE IF WE ARE GOING TO EVALUATE WHETHER NOT WE MADE PROGRESS TO DAY OR YESTERDAY OR NOT THAT'S IN AVALUATION OF HOW WE FEEL IN THE IMMEDIATE PERRY PERSONAL SPACE HOWEVER MOVING TOWARD ANY GOAL INVOLVES ORIENTING OUR THINKING TOWARDS THE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE AND AS WE GO THROUGH TO DAY'S EPISODE I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU A TECHNIQUE OR RATHER A NEURO SINS BASE TOOL THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUALLY TRANSITION BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE PERRY PERSONAL SPACE IN THE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE IN A WAY THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO UP DATE AND EVALUATE AND BETTER EXECUTE YOUR GOAL SEEKING THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS LIKE OTHER ANIMALS HAVE TO MAKE AVALUATIONS ABOUT WHETHER NOT THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK HOWEVER THE IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT HUMANS IN PARTICULAR CAN DO THIS OVER DIFFERENT TIME SCALES WE DON'T JUST PURSUE FOOD CAUSE WE ARE HUNGRY WE PERESURE PURSUE FOOD SCUSE ME FOR A PARTICULAR MEAL THAT WE MIGHT BE HAVING WITH PEOPLE TOMORROW RIGHT WE CAN MODULATE THE TIME SCALE IN AWAY THE OTHER ANIMAL STONT THAT'S HOW WE ADJUST OUR GOAL SEEKING TO DIFFERENT TIMESKILLS AND IN ADDITION TO THAT HUMANS ARE EX QUISITELY GOOD ATBIASING OUR BEHAVIOR TOWARD PARTICULAR GOALS OVER VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF MISSTAKES OUT THERE IN FACT THINGS THAT ARE OUTRIGHT WRONG IN THE LITERATURE N IND PARTICULAR AND THE INERNET AND IN THE CONDWELNESS AND FITNESS AND COGNIVE FITNESS SPACE THAT SEND PEOPLE DOWN THE WRONG PATH AND THOSE THINGS WE WILL TALK ABOUT IN FEW MINUTES BUT THINGS LIKE VISUALIZATION THAT VISUALIZATION AND VISUALIZATION OF THIS BIG GOAL IS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS IN FACT THAT'S NOT THE CASE THERE'S A MUCH BETTER APPROACH TO DOING ALL THIS SO NOW I'D LIKE TO SHIFTEARS TOWARDS TALKING ABOUT A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE GET BADLY WRONG IN SETTING AND ASSESSING AND EXECUTING GOALS THIS IS BASED ON PUREVIEWED RESEARCH SO I THINK IT'S VERY SOLID I KNOW IT IS VERY SOLID AND IT RUNS COUNTER TO WHAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN TAUGHT LET'S START WITH A SIMPLE ONE WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT MULTI TASKING IS BAD WE'VE HEAR MULTITASKING AS BAD IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR FOCUS IF YOU WON'T ACHIEVE ANYTHING YOU ON'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING YOU SHOULD NOT MULTI TASK WELL TURNS OUT THAT'S WRONG TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS A ROLL FOR MULTI TASKING BUT THE MULTI TASKING HAS TO BE PLACED AT A PARTICULAR TIME WITHIN YOUR GOAL SEEKING BEHAVIOUR IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE REALLY NICE STUDIES DONE AT CARDIC CARNEGI MELLON UNIVERSITY  THE DABISH LAB I VALUATED HOW LONG PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO FOCUS IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS HOW LONG THEY ARE ABLE TO STAY CONCENTRATED ON THEIR WORK AND IT TURNS OUT THAT NUMBER IS EXSEEDINGLY LOW TURNS OUT THAT MOST PEOPLE WHETHER NOT THEY'RE DOING COMPUTER WORK OR WHETHER NOT THEY'RE DOING WRITING OR ACCOUNTING WORK OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT CAN HOLD THEIR ATTENTION FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES AT A TIME BEFORE THEY SHIFT THEIR ATTENTION OFF THAT'S RIDICULOUSLY LOW WHEN YOU FIRST HEAR IT BUT THAT PROBABLY REFLECTS A BASIC STATE OF BRAIN FUNCTION THAT HEARKENS BACK TO A TIME WHEN WE WERE HUNTER GATHERS I DOUBT THAT WE WERE MAINTAINING FOCUS SOLIDLY FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS UNLESS WE WERE UNDER SOME PARTICULAR THREAT OR SOME IN SOME PARTICULAR CRISIS RATHER YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE COLLECTED SEEDS AND NOUTS AND BERRIES FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES AND THEN PROWE HE STOOD UP LOOKED AROUND AND THEN KEPT GOING ONGAY OR THAT THEY WERE HUNTING ANIMALS OR IN SOME SORT OF PURSUIT FISHING ET CETERA AND FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS AND EVERY THREE MINUTES ORTOL THEY MIGHT HAVE LOOKED UP AND YOU KNOW THAY CAN LOOK OF THE SKY OR LOOKD AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT ON OTHER PEOPLE WERE THERE OR NOT THERE ET CETERA IT ALL STANDS TO REASON THAT THAT WILL BE THE CASE AGAIN THE NURL CIRCUITS HAVENANT INVOLVED MUCH NOW MULTI TASKING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A VERY INTERESTING PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNATURE WHEN WE MULTI TASK WHEN WE JUMP BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THINGS THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF THE NARROW TRANSMITTER ALSO SOME NOES CALLED THE NURROMAGULATER BUT BASELY SAME THING FOR SAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION THERE'S AN INCREASE IN THE NURRO TRANSMITTER EPINEFEREN WHICH IS A DRENALINE AND SO THERE REALLY NICE STUDIES NOW POINT TO THE FACT THAT DOING A BIT OF MULTI TASKING PRIOR TO JUMPING INTO SOME FOCUS GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR WITHEN ITS MENTAL BEHAVIOR OR PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR CAN ACTUALLY BE USEFUL BECAUSE IT GETS US INTO ACTION SO WE'VE ALL BEEN TOLD THAT MULTITASKING IS TERRIBLE BUT IF YOU FOR INSTANCE FIND YOURSELF CLEANING UP YOUR HOUSE AND ALSO CHECKING YOUR PHONE AND DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS RIGHT AT THE POINT WHERE YOU SHOULD BE SITTING DOWN TO RIGHT OR DO SOME FOCUSD WORK IT PROBABLY REFLECT SOME ADAPTOVE MECHANISM WHERE YOU USE ACTION AND SOMEWHAT VARIED MULTITASKING ACTION IN ORDER TO GENERATE A DRENDALIN IN YOUR SYSTEM BECAUSE A DRENDALIN JUST GETS YOU INTO ACTION NOW THAT'S GREAT BUT YOU DON'T WANT A MULTI TASK THROUGHOUT ANY KIND OF GOAL SEEKING OR GOAL PURSUIT BEHAVIOR BECAUSE WHAT'S ALSO VERY CLEAR ANDWE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN EXQUISITE DEPTH TO DAY IS THAT VISUAL FOCUS AND IN PARTICULAR CONTRACTING YOUR VISUAL WINDOW BRINGING THE APERTURE OF WHAT YOU SEE TO A VERY FINE POINT CAN ABSOLUTELY INCREASE YOUR CLARITY OF GOAL SEEKING AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WILL PURSUE YOUR GOALS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLEBIT BEFORE IN THE PODCAS IS A WAY OF INCREASING FOCUS FOR ANY KIND OF PURSUIT I'VE TALKED ABOUT A PRACTIS WHEREBY YOU CAN LITERALLY LOOK AT A DOT OR A LINE PLACED ON A WALL OR ON YOUR COMPUTOR IN FRONT OF YOU FIRST THIRTY TO SIXTY SECONDS AND THEN MOVING INTO SOME DEDICATED WORK WHERE YOU NEED TO FOCUS AND INDEED JUST LOOKING AT NARROW PIECE OF THE VISUAL WORLD A SMALL PIECE OF THE VISUAL WORLD FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME IN FORCING YOURSELF TO HOLD THAT GAZE ON THAT LOCATION AS BEST YOU CAN CAN INCREASE YOUR LEVEL OF COGNAT OF ATTENTION IN YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND STAY FOCUS AND THIS IS NOT MAGIC IT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT MOST OF YOUR COGNITION FOLLOWS YOUR VISUAL PURCEPTION FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE LOW VISION OR NO VISION MEANING YOUR BLIND OR YOU HAVE TROUBLE SEENG MY LAVE DOES A LOT OF WORK WITH A PEOPLE WHO ARE LOVISH IN NOVISION THEY TEND TO USE THEIR AUDITORY SYSTEM THEIR HEARING AS A WAY TO ANCHOR THEIR ATTENTION TO PARTICULAR THINGS OKAY BUT MOST PEOPLE OUT THEIR CANCEE AND SEE PRETTY WELL AND VISUAL FOCUS IS THE WAY TO DO THAT NOW EARLY ER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS NOTION OF PERRY PERSONAL SPACE FORSIS EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE AND I'M JUST GOING A SEED A LITLABIT OF THE LATER CONVERSATION BY SAYING THAT WHEN WE FOCUS ON AN EXTERNAL POINT WE ARE IN A PROCESS OF EXTRAOCEPTION IS THE FOCUS ON THE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE NOT THE PERRY PERSONAL SPACE SO WHEN WE FOCUS ON SOMETHING SAY A LINE ON THE WALL FOR THIRTY SIXTY SECONDS OR AT OUR COMPUTER FOR THIRTY SIXTY SECONDS AND JUST LOOK AT IT AND THEN MOVE INTO ANY KIND OF ACTION WHETHER NON ITS WORK ACTION OR PHYSICAL ACTION WE ARE AT ITS VERY CORE WE ARE ENGAGING IN THIS PURSUIT OF EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE WE ARE PLACING OUR FOCUS OUTSIDE OUR BODY AND THEREFORE WE ARE PLACING THE BRAIN INTO GOAL PURSUIT MODE WORK AT M OI OU IN PARTICULAR IN THE LABORATORY OF A A PHENOMENAL RESEARCH FOR IN THEIR PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT  BY THE NAME OF EMILY BALSETTUS BE A L C E T I S EMILY BALSETTUS HAS DONE REALLY NICE WORK ON THIS THEY'VE DONE IS THEY HAD PEOPLE FOCUSS THEIR VISUAL ATTENTION ON A GOAL LINE OF SOME SORT AND THEND TO ENGAGE IN SOME SORT OF BEHAVIOR THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF EFFRT THE'VE ONE A LOT OF DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS LIKE THIS BUT I'LL JUST EXPLAIN ONE THEY ALWAYS INCLUDE A CONTROL GROUP WEAR PEOPLE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PHYSICAL EFFORT OR MENTAL EFFORT BUT THEY DON'T FOCUSS THEIR ATTENTION JUST ON ONE LOCATION THE LONG ASHORT OF THESE STUDIES IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO FOCUSS THEIR ATTENTION ON ONE LOCATION LIKE A GOAL LINE THEY ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IN REACHING THOSE GOALS AND THEY ACHIEVE THEM WITH THE PERCEPTION THAT THEY EXPENDED LESS EFFORT WI'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF ONE PARTICULARLY NICE STUDY FROM THE BALSETTUS LAB SO THIS PARTICULAR STUDY INVOLVES PHYSICAL EXERCISE ALTHOUGH IS I MENTION BEFORE THEY'VE DONE SIMILAR STUDIES LOOKING AT COGNITIVE TYPE WORK AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY HAD A GROUP OF PEOPLE EXERCISE WEARING FIFTEEN POUND ANKGOAL WEIGHTS AND THEY HAD TO BASICALLY MOVE A CERTAIN DISTANCE OR RUN A CERTAIN TIS TO REACH A GOAL LINE ONE GROUP WAS FOCUSD ON THE GOAL LINE VISUALLY FOCUSED ON THE GAL LINE THE OTHER GROUP WAS NOT TOLD TO VISUALLY FOCUS ON THE GOAL LINE AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE GROUP THAT FOCUSSED ON THE GOAL LINE IT WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE REACHING THAT GOAL WITH SEVENTEEN PERCENT LESS EFFORT THEY MEASURED EFFORT AND THAT HE GOT THEIR TWENTY THREE PER CENT QUICKER THAT'S A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE RIGHT SO SAME DISTANCE TRAVELLED WITH SAME WORK LOAD BECAUSE EVERYONE'S WEARING THESE SAME FIFTEEN POUND WEIGHTS ON THEIR ANKLES ONE GROUP IS SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE GOAL LINE THE OTHER GROUP IS NOT TOLD TO LOOK AT THE GOAL LINE SIMPLY BY LOOKING AT THE GOAL LINE DOES SOMETHING TO THE PSYCHOLOGY AND END PHYSIOLOGY OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO MOVE FORWARD WITH LESS PERCEIVED EFFORT AND TO DO IT MORE QUICKLY THAT'S REMARKABLE RIGHT AND IN THIS CASE THE FOCUSED ON THE GOAL LINE BUT IN A FEW MOMENTS WILL TALK ABOUT HOW ONE CAN USE UP DATING OF GOAL LINE SO INCREMENTAL GALINE STARTING WITH AN INTERMEDIATE GOAL AND THEN EXTENDING THE GOAL LINE FURTHER AND FURTHER BUT JUST SIT BACK FOR SECOND AND THINK ABOUT THAT JUST BY CHANGING WEAR A PERSON LOOKS THEY CHANGE THEIR PERCIEVED EFFORT AND THEIR ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE QUICKLY THAN A GROUP THAT IS NOT DELIBERATELY FOCASSING THEIR VISUAL ATTENTION ON ONE LOCATION THAT'S INCREDIBLE AND IT'S SO INCREDIBLE IN FACT YOU MIGHT SAY  HOW COAL THAT POSSIBLY BE WHAT TURNS OUT IT HAS A VERY SPECIFIC UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGICAL REASON AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH CHANGES IN OUR SO CALLED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAN ASPECTS OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT PREPARE US FOR READINESS AND ACTION OR THAT PREPARE US FOR RESTING AND RELAXING SO WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT FOCUSING ONE'S VISUAL ATTENTION AT A GIVEN LOCATION WHAT TURNS OUT THAT WE HAVE TWO BRANCHES OF OUR VISUAL SYSTEM SO VISUAL INFORMATION ALL COMES IN THROUGH OUR EYES BUT THEN THIY CAN HEAD DOWN TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS ONE PATHWAY IS ENGAGE WHEN OUR VISION IS BROUGHT TO A COMMON POINT WHENE WE CALL A VERGENCIYE MOVEMENT SO FOR FOCUSSING VERY INTENSELY ON A GIVEN POINT REGARDLESS OF HOW FAR AWAY FROM US THAT POINT IS ARE VISUAL SYSTEM ENGAGES A CERTAIN SET OF NURON'S NURL CIRCUITS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN RESOLVING FINE DETAIL AND THAT CAN EVALUATE SMALL CHANGES OVER SMALL PERIODS OF TIME JUST THINK OFIT IS A VERY DETAILED CAMERA OF THE VISUAL WORLD INTEND TO BE VERY RESTRICTED THE OTHER PATHWAY THROUGH THE VISUAL SYSTEM IS A SO CALL MAGNO CELLAR PATHWAY AND THIS IS A PATHWAY THAT'S INVOLVED IN TAKING IN GLOBAL INFORMATION ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AROUND US MOVEMENT OF THINGS TO ARE RIGHT MOVEMENT OF THINGS TO OUR LEFT THINGS ARE HAPPENING DOWN ON THE GROUND AND ALL AROUND US AND THAT PATHWAY INVOLVES A SORT OF RELAXATION IF YOU WILL OF THE NERRL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ALERTNESS AND ATTENTION WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET YOUARE NOT THINKING ABOUT MUCH PROVIDEDG YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE YOU'RE OT FOCUSSING ON ONE LOCATION YOURE MORE LESSIN TAT RELAXED STATE COMPARED TO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PARTICULAR SIGNE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BOSS OR A TRAIN THAT'S COMING OR A PARTICULAR PRERSON AND THAT SHOULD ANHERENTLY MAKE SENSE WHEN YOUR LEVEL OF ATTENSION AND ALERTNESS GOES OUT THI SORT OF A SMALL BUT PERCEPTIBLE INCREASE IN YOUR LEVEL OF A ROUSAL IT'S NOT REALLY STRESS NECESSARILY BUT A ROUSAL OF ALERTNESS AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE VISUAL SYSTEM A COMPLISHES THIS INCREASE IN ALERTNESS BY COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND THE SYSTEM THAT DELIVERS BLOOD AND NEUTRIENCE AND OXYGEN TO THE REST OF THE TISSUES IN YOUR BODY SO IT'S TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT WHAT FOCUSSING OUR VISION ON A PARTICULAR LOCATION DOES BECAUSE IN THE STUDY FROM THE BALCETTIS LAB WHAT THEY FOUND WAS FOCUSSING ON A GOL LINE ALLOWS PEOPLE TO MOVE MORE EFFECTIVELY TOWARD THAT GOAL THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN LAVERAGE IN ALL ASPECTS OF ALL GOAL PURSUITS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR LOCATION BELIEVE IT ARE NOT THERE'S AN INCREASE IN A PARTICULAR FEATURE OF OUR BLOOD PRESSURE NOW YOUR BODY HAS OF COURSE ARTERY'S VEINS AND CAPILARIES AND YOUR HEART POMPS BLOOD FIRST TO THE ARTERIES AND THEN TO THE OTHER A COMPONENTS OF OURVASCULAR SYSTEM AND WE HAVE SO CALLED BLOOD PRESSURE MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS JUST HOW MUCH THE FLUID VOLUME IS PRESSING ON THOSE ARTERIES VEINS AND CAPLARIES S YOU CAN IMAGINE A PIPE WITH VERY LITTLE FLUID MOVING THROUGH IT THAT'S LOW PRESSURE YOU HAVE A PIPE WITH A LOT OF FLUID MOVING THROUGH IT THAT'S EVEN MORE PRESSURE YOU HAVE A PIPE WITH A LOT OF VERY VISCOUS MEANING VERY KIND OF A STICKY THICK STUFF MOVING FOR T THAT'S EVEN MORE PRESSURE WE HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOU'VE PROBLY HAD YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURED THERE'S ALWAYS TWO NUMBERS RIGHT YOUHAVE A TOP NUMBER WHICH IS THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND THEN YOU THERE'S THE BOTTOM NUMBER BELOW THE LINE WHICH IS THE DIOSTOLIC PRESSURE SO THE IMPORTAN THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE WILL RISE WHEN YOUR HEART BEATS BECAUSE THERE'S MORE FLUID MOVING THROUGH THOSE PIPES THAT ARE YOUR ARTERIES YOUR VEINS IN YOUR CAPLARIES AND THAT TOP NUMBER IS CALLED THE SISTOL OR THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE BECAUSE THAT'S THE PRESSURE AT THE TIME WHEN YOUR HEART CONTRACTS O SO THE TOP NUMBER WHICH NORMALLY IF YOU HAVE A HEALTHY BLOOD PRESSURE IS SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF NINETY TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLIMETERS OF MERCURY MILLIMERES AF MERCURIES JUST THE WAY THAT PRESSURE IS MEASURED THAT T OP NUMBER YOUR SYST YOUR SYSTOLE YOUR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE IS WHAT'S MEASURED WHEN THE HEART CONTRAC OK SO THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE WHEN THERE'S A HEART BEAT AND ITS MOVING THROUGH YOUR ASCULATURE NOW BETWEEN BEATS RIGHT THE HEART BEATS BUT THEN IT RELACES YOUR BLOOD PRESSURES CAN A DROP TO A LOWER VALUE RIGHT BECAUSE FLUID ISNIT BEING PUMPED THROUGH THE SYSTEM AT THOSE MOMENTS AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM VALUE THE DIOSTLIC PRESSURE AND TYPICALLY FOR HEALTHY PEOPLE THAT'S GOING TO BE SIXTY TO EIGHTY MILIMETERS OF MERCURY SO YOU MIGHT HEAR ABOUT A NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE BEING ABOUT AGAIN THIS IS AN A PROXIMATE A HUNDRE AND TWENTY OVER EIGHTY WHAT THAT MEANS IS AT THE POINT WHERE BLOOD WAS BEING PUMPED THROUGH E YOUR ARTERIES IN VAINS BOUM THAT IT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILIMETERS OF MERCURY BUT THEN WHEN THE HEART RELAXES FOR A SECOND BEFORE THE NEXT BEAT THEN IT DROPS TO EIGHTY OCASO THERE'S HIGH PRESSURE LOW PRESSURE HIGH PRESSURE LOW PRESSURE THIS THE FLUIT IS BEING PUMPED THROUGH THE SYSTEM AN WHY AM I TELLING YOU ALL THIS WHAT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE NOURAL CIRCUITS THAT LINK YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND FOCUSING ON A PARTICULAR POINT WITH THAT TOP NUMBER THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND WHEN YOU FOCUS YOUR EYES ON A PARTICULAR LOCATION THAT SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE GOES UP AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE CORDINATED WITH IT IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT START RELEASING A DRENALINE LOW AMOUNTS OVER DRENALIN IN MOST CASES AND THAT A DRENALIN FURTHER READIES YOUR BODY FOR ACTION SO BRINGING OUR VISUAL FOCUST O PARTICULAR LOCATION DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS TO THE BRAIN AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF THE BODY TO PREPARE IT TO PLACE IT INTO A STATE OF READINESS THAT MAKES US MORE LIKELY TO LEAN INTO OUR GOALS INTO ACTION AND IF WE STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT THAS THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE THE BRAIN AND BODY NEED TO BE CORDINATED WE CAN'T JUST THINK ABOUT A GOAL IN FACT A DEER OR A LION CAN'T JUST THINK ABOUT A GOAL IT HAS TO THINK ABOUT A GOAL AND THEN HAS TO FEEL SOME SORT OF ACTIVATION ENERGY SOME WILLINGNESS OR DESIRE TO MOVE FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF THAT GOAL SO IMAGINING A GOAL HAS TO BE COUPLED TO THE PHYSICAL PURSUIT OF THE GOAL SO OUR VISUAL SYSTEM IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY BRINGS TOGETHER A FOCUS LITERALLY OF VISUAL FOCUSTS ON A PARTICULAR POINT OUTSIDE US THEN IT RECRUITS AND INCREASE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE WHICH CREATES A SYSTEMIC A BODY WIDE AND BRAIN WIDE INCREASE IN FUAL UTILIZATION IN OXYGEN AVAILABILITY IN OUR WILLINGNESS TO MOVE FORWARD AS A BODY AS A WHOLE COHERENT SYSTEM AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO NAURO TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS LIKE APINEPRONIS AS WE WILL SOON SEE DOPOMINE THAT GET RECRUITED AS WELL TO PLACE US INTO A CONTINUAL MODE OF ACTION THIS TO ME IS A REMARKABLE FEATURE OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY AND IT GETS RIGHT TO THE POINT OF SOME OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON THT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WAS JUST RECALL WHAT SOME OF THOSE ARE WON'T LIST THEM ALL BUT YOU KNOW A GOAL HAS TO BE SIGNIFICANT THEY SAY OCHA ALL THE PSYCHOLOGISTS ALL THE POPULAR STULFALINES HAS TO BE SIG NIFICANT HAS TO BE INSPIRATIONAL AND HAS TO BE ACTION ORIENTED OCASE SO LET SAY YOU LOOK OUT INTO THE LANDSCAPE OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU WHETHER NOT'S JUST IN YOUR MIND OR YOU LOOK AT A SPECIFIC POINT YOU SAY AH I WANT TO GO TO THAT PARTICULAR RESTAURANT TO EAT THAT PARTICULAR FOOD AND YOU ORIENT TOWARDS IT AND YOU MOVE TOWARDS ED THIS IS THE WAY THAT YOUR BRAIN AMBODY ARE CORDINATING THEIR ACTIONS TOGETHER CONVERSELY WHEN OUR VISUAL SYSTEM IS IN A MODE OF LOOKING AT EVERYTHING WHEN THE APERTURE OF OUR VISUAL SYSTEM IS VERY BROAD WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ALSO A REDUCTION IN OUR GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOUR AND A REDUCTION IN THE SOSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE IT'S AS IF ARE PERY PERSONAL SPACE IS SUFFICIENT WE DON'T NEED TO GET BEYOND OUR CURRENT STATE WE'RE NOT ORIENTED TOWARD ANY ONE THING IN PARTICULAR OCASE SO I'VE NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF THE PSYCHOLOGY AND SOME OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGY NOW I'D LIKE TO MESH THIS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ACTUAL SPECIFIC GOAL SETTING AND GOAL PURSUIT BECAUSE WHAT MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY THING ING THIS OKA THAT SOME PHYSIOLOGY EITHER SOME PSYCHOLOGY BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY APPLY THIS TOWARD SETTING AND ACHIEVING GOALS WELL YOU DO THAT BY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR MENTAL FRAME AND YOUR ATTENTION ARE ALWAYS EITHER POSITION TO YOUR PERY PERSONAL SPACE FOCUSED ON YOUR IMMEDIATE POSSESSIONS AND STATE OR TOWARDS THINGS OUTSIDE YOU BUT THAT YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DYNAMICALLY TRAVEL BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THOSE AND SO NEXT WORE OIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE LITERATURE SAYS ABOUT THINGS LIKE VISUALIZATION IMMEDIATE AND INTERMEDIATE GOALS LONG TERM GOALS AND HOW TO BEST ACHIEVE THOSE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE SPECIFICALLY INTO THE PROTOCOLS THAT YOU CAN USE T'S A PROTOCALL THAT IAVE SPECIFICALLY DEVELOPED FOR YOU THE LISTENERS IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE ALL THE SCIENCE INTO A BEST PRACTICE THAT YOU CAN DO ANY TIME ANY PLACE TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS SPECIFICALLY THAT YOU WANT TO PURSUI AND THE BEST ROUTE TO PURSUE AND ACHIEVE THAT GOAL FOCUASSING OUR VISUAL ATTENTION ON ONE PARTICULAR POINT IS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE FOR ALL TYPES OF GOAL PURSUIT AND IF YOU LIKE TO READ SOME OF THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OR READ A REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT HAVE LOOKED IT HOW NARROWING ONE'S VISUAL ATTENTION CAN REALLY ENHANTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PURSUING GOALS I'LL PUT A LINK TO THIS STUDY THE TITLE OF A STUDY IS KEEPING THE GOAL IN SIGHT TESTING THE INFLUENCE OF NARROWED VISUAL TTENTION ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND THIS IS A PAPER FROM EMILYBALL SETIS'S LAB FOCUSIS MAINLY ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES BUT IT MENTION SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL  THIS IS A A ARTICLE PUBLISH IN PERSONALITY IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOTY BULLITAN AND TWENTY TWENTY TO ITS RECENT AH IT'S EEEXCEPTIONAL PAPER IN MY OPINION REALLY GETS TO THE HEART OF HOW ALL THIS WORKS AN SOM AN EXAMPLES OF WHERE IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED SO LET'S APPLY THIS VISUAL TOOL IN A VERY SIMPLE WAY TO ANY TYPE OF GOAL THAT YOU WANT TA PURSUE IF YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT GOAL YOU WANT TO PURSUE MAY BE IT'S A WORK OUT MAY BE IT'S A COGNIVE WORK OF SOME PARTICULAR SORT AGAIN THE PROCESS OF VERY SIMPLE YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUSS YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION ON ONE POINT BEYOND YOUR PERY PERSONAL SPACE O IT COUL BE ON YOUR COMPUTER COULD BE ON THE WALL IT COULD BE A HORIZON IT COULD E AT A AT A DISTANCE AND YOU CAN A FOCUSS YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION THERE AND WITH SOME EFFORT YOU CAN HOLD YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION FOR THIRTY TO SIXTY SECONDS YOU MIGHT BLINK THAT'S O K BUT YOUR OING TO TRY AND HOLD YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION THERE SO NO MOVING YOUR HEAD AROUND I'M NO DIVERTING YOUR ATTENTION TO OTHER LOCATIONS SOME PEOPLE WILL FIND IT VERY EASY TO DO OTHER PEOPLE  FIND IT QUITE HARD YOUR MIND MAY DRIFT COGNIVELY THAT'S O K BUT TRY AND BRING YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION TO THAT COMMON POINT SEVERAL EPISODES AGO I TALKED ABOUT HOW THEIR ACTUALY STUDIES LOOKING AT DEVELOPING THIS KIND OF TRAINING IN STUDENTS FOR AHTY HT AND THE DATE ON THAT ARE ACTUALLY QUITE ENCOURAGING SO FOR PEOPLE W HAV A D HT AND FOCUS ISSUES AND ATTENTIONAL ISSUES THIS CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T THIS CAN ALSO BE EFFECTIVE AGAIN IT PLACES YOUR BRAIN AND BODY INTO A STATE OF READINESS AND THEN THE IDEA IS TO MOVE INTO THE PARTICULAR ACTIONS THAT BRING YOU CLOSER TO YOUR GOAL GE WE HAVEN'T YET TALKED ABOUT HOW TO SET GOALS AND HOW TO ASSESS PROGRESS THIS IS SIMPLY HOW TO PURSUE GOALS OK BUT THE VISUAL COMPONENT IS IMPORTAT IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND HARNESSING YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION TO A NARROW POINT IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET YOUR BRAIN AND BODY INTO A MODE OF ACTION TO PURSU WHATEVER GOAL IT IS YOUR TRYING TO PURSUT THAT PRACTICE IS IN START CONTRAST TO MOULTI TASKING WHERE BY DEFINITION YOUR ATTENTION IS MOVING FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO PLACE RIGHT I MENTION THAT MULTI TASKING CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN GETTING YOUR SYSTEM INTO SOMEWHAT OF AN INCREASE LEVEL OF ACTIV ACTIVATION SO THA YOU CAN PURSUE A MORE FOCUSSED GOAL BUT THE VISUAL ATTENTION TO A PARTICULAR POINT IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO BRING YOUR SYSTEM INTO A STATE OF READINESS AND ACTION FOR GOAL PURSUIT THERE'S ANOTHER REALLY INTERESTING WAY THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM TOWARD LONG TERM GOALS THE BALSET A SLAP HAS ALSO DONE SOME REALLY INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS LOOKING AT PEOPLES ABILITY TO SET AND STICK TO LONG TERM GOALS AND THE LONG TERM GOAL THAT THEY LOOKED AT WAS ONE RELATED TO SAVING MONEY FOR LATER IN LIFE THIS IS ONLY A LOT OF PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH THE LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME INVESTING MONEY OR SAVING MONEY FOR LATER IN LIFE SIMPLY BECAUSE AS HUMAN BEINGS WE VARY IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN LATER HERE'S ALSO A PHENOMENON I'F SO CALLED DELAYED DISCOUNTING DELAY DISCOUNTING IS THE FACT THAT GOALS BECOME LESS REWARDING WHEN THEY EXIST FURTHER OUT IN THE FUTURE HOW YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCE THIS WALKING PAST A DONA CH I LOVE DONAS JUS CAN ADMIT IT OVER AND OVER AGOWN THIS BUT I LOVE THE SMELL OF THE MELL OF THE TASTE OF THEM I TRY TO EAT THEM CAUSE I'M TOLD THERE NOT THAT GOOD FOR MEAN INDEED I I DON'T THINK THEY ARE I OCCASIONALLY KAVE AND I EAT ONE OR MANY BUT IN GENERAL I TRY NOT TO CAVE TO THE IMMEDIATELY REWARDING PROPERTIES OF THE SMELL ON THE TASTE OF THE DO IT BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IF YOU SMELL A DONAT OR YOU SMELL A WONDERFUL PIECE OF FOOD IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM IT BRINGS YOUR LEVEL OF FOCUS YOUR MENTAL FOCUS TO THE IMMEDIATE PHASE AND IT FEELS VERY REWARDING LIKE IF YOU HAD IT NOW IT WOULD JUST BE SO GOOD BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY EXTEND THAT REWARD OUT TO TO MORROW OR THE NEXT ANYTHING ARE YOU KNOW OM TO DAY HAPPENS TO BE A SATURDAY THAT WERE ACCORDING BUT OOUKNO ON TUESDAY MORNING I'M GN TO GET A DOUGHNA IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME VALUE BECAUSE THE REWARD SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK AS WELL FOR LONG TERM GOALS IT IS NOT AS AS SALIENT IT'S NOT AS TANGIBLE A GOAL ESPECIALY FOR SOMETHING LIKE A DOUGHNA WHEREAS THE KINDS OF GOALS THAT WORK WHEN YOU PLACE THEM OUT INTO THE LONGER TERM AND CAN CREATE A HEIGHTEN SENSE OF MOTIVATION TEN TO BE THINGS THAT ARE MUCH MORE REWARDING TO US SO DELAY DISCOUNTING SIMPLY SAYS THAT THE FURTHER OUT IN TIME THAT A IVEN GOAL IS THE LESS EFFECTIVE THAT REWARD WILL BE IN MOTIV ATING ONE'S BEHAVIOR AND INDEED YOU SEE THIS WITH SAVING MONEY FOR RETIREMENT YOU SEE THIS WITH ALL SORTS OF LONG TERM INVESTMENT THE BAUSET ASLAB THEREFORE DID AN EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY LOOKED AT PEOPLE'S TENDENCY TO SAVE MONEY FOR LATER IN LIFE BUT THE GROUPS THAT THEY CREATED IN THE STUDY WERE REALLY INTERESTING THEY HAD ONE GROUP IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS OLDER AND THEN TO INVEST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY ACCORDING TO WHATEVER IT IS THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD NEED AND THEY MEASURE THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAD SET ASIDE AND SAVED FOR LATER IN LIFE THE OTHER GROUP ACTUALLY VIEWED PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES SO PICTURE IMAGES OF THEMSELVES THAT WERE ARTIFICIALLY IDIGILLY AGE SO THAT THEY COULD SEE THEMSELVES THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS INTO THE FUTURE AND IT TURNS OUT THAT PEOPLE IN THAT SECOND GROUP SIMPLY BY PERCEIVING THEIR OWN IMAGE IN THE FUTURE INVESTED FAR MORE MONEY INTO LATER LIFE I THEY SET ASIDE MORE MONEY SOMEHOW IBRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THEIR IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE AND THE LONGER ARK TOWARD WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE IN THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS SO VERY POWERFUL RESULT IN MY OPINION BECAUSE WHAT IT SAYS AGAIN IS THAT OUR VISUAL PERCEPTION OF THE FUTURE OR OUR VISUAL PERCEPTION OF THE PRESENT IS WHAT ALLOWS US TO ANCHOR OR GOAL DIRECTED SYSTEMS AND OUR MOTIVATION TO TAKE ON THINGS THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM MIGHT NOT SEEM THAT USEFUL SO YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF A VARIATIONS ON THIS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT EVERY TIME I WANT A DOUGHNA I'D SEE A VISION OF MYSELF OR AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL PICTURE OF MYSELF OM AS A CONSEQUENCE OF AD HAVING EATEN MANY DOUGHNAS EVERY DAY FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS I DON'T KNOWAT THAT IMAGE WE LOOK LIKE AS I'VE NEVER SEEN IT A THAT'S NOT AN EXPERMENT THAT NECESSARILY NEED TO DO BECASE I'M NOT THAT MOTIVE ITYDOUGNATS BUT I HAVE TO CONFESS YOU KNOW I SOMEBODY WHO I THINK I'M PRETTY GOOD AT MANAGING RESOURCES BUT I THINK IF I WERE TO SEE AN IMAGE OF MYSELFE AT SEVENTY OR SEVENTY FIVE THERE SO MANY THINGS ARE ASSOCIATE WITH VISUAL IMAGES LIKE WHAT OUR BODY MUST FEEL LIKE WHAT ARE NEEDS ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE LIKE IN THAT STATE OR IN THAT AGE WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WE MAY OR MAY NOT STILL BE ABLE TO DO AT THAT AGE AND THAT ANCHORS BACK TO IMMEDIATE GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIORS SUCH AS SETTING ASIDE MONEY FOR RETIREMENT SUCH AS INVESTING IN ONE'S HEALTH PRACTICES AND INDEED THERE'S A STUDY THAT HAS LOOKED AT HOW PEOPLE WILL INVEST IN EXERCISE AND HEALTHY EATING IF THEY JUST THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE AND WHAT THEY MIGHT BE LIKE IN THE FUTURE VERSES SEEING IMAGES OF THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE IF THEY WERE TO GO DOWN A HEALTHY OR UNHEALTHY ROUTE SO AGAIN THE POINT IS THAT THE VISUAL SYSTEM WHAT WE SEE IS PRINCIPALLY IMPORTANT IN DEFINDING WHAT WE DO IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM EVEN IF WHAT WE SEE RELATES TO SOMETHING IN THE FAR OFF DISTANCE I THINK THESE ARE PHENOMENAL STUDIES AND THEY GET RIGHT DOWN TO AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT'S BEEN KICKED AROUND OVER AND OVER IN THE LITERATURE AND IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT GOAL SEEKING WHICH IS VISUALIATION WE HEARE KEEP THE BIG GOAL IN MINE FOCUS ON THE BIG GOAL SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS WHAT IS THE SCIENCE SAY ABOUT VISUALIZING BIG GOALS IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOIS INTEREST IN BUSINESS OR A LET'S AT YOUR FOCUST ON RELATIONSHIP IS THINKING ABOUT THE PERFECT RELATIONSHIP AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND THE THE FAMILY THAT YOU WOULD HAVEAND WHERE YOU WOULD LIVE IS THAT EFFECTIVE IN GENERATING THE KINDS OF BEHAVIORS THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO THAT IS IT EFFECTIVE TO THINK ABOUT THE BIG WIN AT THE END WHAT TURNS OUT IT IS BUT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL WITH WHEN AND HOW YOU IMPLEMENT THAT VISUALIZATION CAUSE IF YOU DO IT CORRECTLY IT CAN REALLY SERVE YOUR GOAL SEEKING WELL AND IF YOU DO IT INCORRECTLY IT CAN UNDERMINE THE ENTIRE PROCESS SO DOES VISUALIZATION WORK WELL TURNS OUT THAT VISUALIZATION OF THE BIG WIN THE ENGOALSO THE SUPERBL WIN OR EIGHT GOALD METALS IN THE OLYMPICS OR GRAGUATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF YOUR CHOICE OR MAKING A CERTAI AMOUNT OF MONEY OR FINDING THE PARTNER OF YOUR CHOICE ET CETERA THAT VISUALIZATION IS EFFECTIVE IN GETTING THE GOAL PURSUIT PROCESS STARTED BUT IT ACTUALLY IS A PRETTY LOUSY AND MAY BEVEN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WAY OF MAINTAINING PURSUIT OF THAT GOAL MEANING CONTINUING TO ENGAGE THE SORT OF ACTIONS THAT ARE GOINGTO GET YOU TO EVENTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT GOAL I THINK THIS A GOIG TO BE SURPRISING TO PEOPL AT FIRST BUT IF WE THINK BACK TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTEM IT WILL MAKE SENSE GOOD SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE WHERE PEOPLE ARE TOLD TO IMAGINE OR EVEN SCRIPT OUT THEIR LONG TERM VISION AND GOAL FOR THEMSELVES WHAT IS THE BIG GOAL AND IT THERE TAUGHT TO OR TOLD TO IMAGINE IT WITH A RICH AMOUNT OF DETAIL TO THINK TAT HOW IT'S CAN A FEEL IN THEIR BODY AN THE BIG WIND AND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU MEASURE PEOPLE'S BLOOD PRESSURE OR OTHER MATRICS OF PHYSIOLOGY YOU SEE IN INCREASE IN THAT SOSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE THEREIS AN KIND OF A RAMPING UP OF THE READINESS AND EXCITEMENT FOR THAT GOAL BUT THAT INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE QUICKLY WAINS AND OVER TIME THAT VISUAL OF THE LONG TERM GOAL BECOMES A POOR THING TO RELY ON IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE ACTIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO REACH THAT GOAL IN FACT THERE'S A MUCH BETTER WAY TO MAINTAIN ON GOING ACTION TOWARD A GOAL THAT ALSO INVOLVES HIS UALIZATION BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S NOT ABOUT VISUALIZING SUCCESS IT'S ABOUT VISUALIZING FAILURE THE BALSETTU SLAB AND OTHER LABS HAVE LOOKED AT WHETHER NOT PEOPLE MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD GOALS OF DIFFERENT TYPES WHETHER R NOT THERE THINKING ABOUT THE GOAL THE THING ABOUT THAT GOAL LINE AND WHAT THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THAT LONG TURN GOAL AND ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS ASSOCIATE WITH IT OR WHETHEROR NOT THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY COULD FAIL AND ROUTE TO THAT GOAL  THIS IS NOT TYPICALLY WHAT WE ARE ENCOURAGE TO DO TYPICALLY WE ARE TOLD DON'T IMAGINE FAILURE PUSH FAILURE OUT OF YOUR MIND ONLY FO CASON SUCCESS YOU KNOW FAKAT TILL YOU MAKE IT OR IS A FHRASE THAT I ABSOLUTELY HATE AFRANKLY BECAUSE IM CLEAR WITH THAT MEANS AND ATS IM CLEAR WHAT THE ETHICAL FORM OF THAT IS I THINK IT MEANS CONTINUE DESPITE ANY ANXIETY OR FEAR THAT THINGS WON'T WORK OUT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WHAT THE BALSETTU SLAB AND OTHER LAPS HAVE SHOWN IS THAT THERE'S A NEAR DOUBLING NEAR DOUBLING IN THE PROBABILITY OF REACHING ONE'S GOAL IF YOU FOCUS ROUROUTINELY ON FORESHADOWING FAILURE YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS COULD FAIL IF YOU TAKE ACTION A OR YOU TAKE ACTION BE AND INSTEAD THEREFORE YOU TAKE ACTION SE YOU'RE SPESS TO THINK ABOUT HOW THINGS COULD FAIL IF YOU DON'T GET UP AND RUN EACH MORNING IF YOUR GOAL IS SAY A FITNESS GOAL SO LET'S IT USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I REALIZE PEOPLEL ARE IN PURSUIT OF MANY THINGS NOT JUST FITNESS FITNESS GOALS AND PHYSICAL GOALS ARE A VERY CONCRETE THING THAT WE CAN ALL GET ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT AS THEYARE RELATED TO ACTIONS LET'S SAY SOMEBODY IS THEY SETS A GOAL OF RUNNING FIVE MILES FOUR TIMES A WEEK MINIMUM AND AS MANY AS SEVEN FOUR TIMES WEETMENTMUN BE FOUR AT A M CAN A PREVIOUS POD CAST ON HABITS I TALKED ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF NONSIR SETTING SPECIFIC TIMES THAT ONE WILL DO THINGS BUT SETTING TIME GBLOCKS THAT ONE WILL DO THINGS YOU SAY BEFORE AIHT A M YOU CAN RUN FIVE MILES AND THAT'S CAN O HAPPAN UP TO SEVEN DAYS A WEEK  ONE VERSION OF THIS WOULD BE OK SIT BACK IN A CHAIR AND THINK ABOUT HOW GREAT YOU'RE GING TO FEEL IN LOOK IF YOU'RE DOING THIS EVERY DAY HOW YOUR HEALTH IS GOING TO IMPROVE HOW EVERYTHING'S GOINGTO YOUR BLOOD MARKERS OF LIPIDS AT CETER ARE GOING TO IMPROVE OKAY FINE THAT'S THE VISUALIZATION GOAL OF VISUALIZING THE EN POINT TURNS OUT THAT IS FAR LESS EFFECTIVE AND MAY BE EVEN COUNTER PRODUCTIVE COMPARED TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S CON TO HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T DO THIS THE NEGATIVE HEALTH OUT COMES THAT ORE GOING TOR CUR THE DISAPPOINTMENT YOU'RE GONG TO HAVE IN YOURSELF THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL SEVEN THIRTY THAT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR MANY PEOPLE TO RUN FIVE MILES YOU GORE TO PUT ON YOUR SHOES AS TO BE POURING RAIN OR EVEN HAILING OR SNOWING OUTSIDE AND NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING OUTSIDE UNLESS YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOSE PARTICULARLY MOTIVATED TO DO THAT OK SO FOURESHADOWING FAILURE TURNS OUT TO BE THE BEST WAY TO MODE OF EIGHT TOWARD GOAL PURSUIT IN FACT AS I MENTION BEFORE THERE'S IN NEAR DOUBLING IN THE LIKELIHOD THAT PEOPLE WILL REACH GOALS OF ANY KIND WHEN THEY'RE CONSTANTLY THINKING ABOUT HOW BAD IT'S GOING TO BE IF THEY FAIL IF WE THINK BACK TO THE NERL CIRCUIT ASSOCIATED WITH A SESSING VALUE IN OUR GOAL PURSUITS THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE THE EMIGDOLA THAT CENTERE OF THE BRAIN THAT'S IN VOLD AN ANXIETY AND F EARE AND WORRY WELL THE IMIGDOLA IS ONE OF THE FOUR COR COMPONENTS OF OUR GOAL SETTING AND GOAL PURSUIT CIRCUITRY AND THERE'S NO BI PASSING THAT THERE IS NO ONE LISTENING TO THIS OR WATCHING THIS WHOSE IMIDOLA IS NOT INVOLVED IN THEIR GOAL SETTING AND GOAL PURSUIT BEHAVIOR AND SO WHILE I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT ALL YOU SHOUL THINK ABOUT IS RAINBOWS AND PUPPIES AND ALL THE WONDERFUL REWARDING THINGS THAT ORN TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS THE TRUTH IS YOU SHOULD BE THINKING MAINLY ABOUT HOW BAD IT'S REALLY GOING TO GET IF YOU DON'T DO IT HOW DISAPPOINTING YOURSELF YOURE GIN A FEEL HOW IT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT YOU IF NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM IN THE LONG TERM IF INDEED YOUR GOAL IS TO REACH YOUR GOAL SO I WANT O EMPHASIZE THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO FLAGULATE THEMSELVES I'M ENCOURAGING PEOPL TOO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND IT TURNS OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS BY FOR SHADOWING FAILURE AND THE MORE SPECIFIC YOU CAN GET BY RITING DOWN OR THINKING ABOUT OUR TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD IT WILL BE IF YOU DON'T ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT ALMOST CERTAINLY HAS TO DO WITH INCREASES IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND INCREASES IN READINESS IN YOUR SYSTEM WHEN YOU IMAGINE FAILURE THE BRAIN AND BODY ARE MUCH BETTER AT MOVING AWAY FROM FEARFUL THINGS THAN TOWARDS THINGS WE WANT I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT WASN'T THE CASE BUT THERE IS A TRUE A SYMMETRY IN THE WAY WE ARE BUILT IN FACT THE BRAIN AND BODY CAN ENGAGE IN WHAT'S CALLED ONE TRIAL LEARNING WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS WE EAT OF FOOD THAT MAKES A SICK WE HAVE AN INTERACTION WITH A PERSON OR PLACE THAT WE REALLY DON'T LIKE IT ONLY TAKES ONE TRIAL TO READ ONE EVENT ONE TIME TO REORIENT OR REWIRE OUR NURL CIRCUITRY SO THAT WE HAVE A BIAS TOWARD MOVING AWAY FROM THAT THING IN THE FUTURE WHEN THINGS GO WELL UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T OFTEN OCCUR IF THINGS GO REALLY REALLY WELL IT MIGHT ORIENT OUR BRAIN ENBODY TOWARD WANTING MORE OF THAT THING AND WILL HAVE NERRL CIRCUITRY CHANGES THAT WILL LEAD US TO ENGAGE IN THAT PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR OR INTERACTION AGAIN BUT IT IS NEVER AS EFFECTIVE AS THESE AVOIDANT CIRCUITS SO AGAIN FORESHADOW FAILURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO VISUALIZE IN A POSITIVE WAY DO THAT AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF SOME GOAL PURSUIT MAY BE INTERMITTENTLY EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU IMAGINE THE BIG WIN OF IU O SCORING PERFECT ON EXAM OR WINNING THE CHAMPIONSHIP OR THE GREAT RELATIONSHIP BUT MOST OF THE TIME IF YOU WANT OF BE EFFECTIVE YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSSING ON AVOIDING FAILURE AND YOU SHOULD BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THOSE FAILURES WOULD LOOK LIKE IN FEEL LIKE NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT GOAL SETTING GOING BACK TO THAT PROMINENT LITERATURE THE PSYCHOLOGY AND POPULAR LITERATURE AGAIN CAN HERE SOME OF THESE THEME START TO EDMERGE THE GOAL SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT WE ARE TOLD IT SHOULD BE INSPIRATIONAL IT SHOULD BE AGRESSIVE YET REALISTIC WELL O KE THAT'S ALL FINE AND GOOD BUT LET'S GET SEMI QUANTITATIVE ABOUT THIS LET'S AT LEAST GET BIOLOGICAL ABOUT THIS HOW INSPIRATIONAL DOESNIT NEED TO BE IS DOES IT NEED TO BE THE KIND OF THING THAT IS SO INSPIRING TO ME THAT I CAN'T SLEEP AT ALL WITHOUT ONE BE GOOD BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND I KNOW MANY YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY MANY MANY TIMES BEFORE REGULAR DEEP SLEEP EIGHTY PER CENT OR MORE OF THE NIGHTS THAT YOU GO TO SLEEP IS GOING TO BE CRUCIAL TO YOUR COGNIVE AND MENTAL FUNCTIONING IN YOUR BILITY ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS IN A LONG TERM THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR SO IT'S HOW TO BE INSPIRATIONAL AND EXCITING BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY LOOK LIKE AND WHAT IS THAT CORRESPOND TO AND HOW TO WE ACTUALY MAKE THAT HAPPEN WELL ONCE AGAIN THERE IS A MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT THE REAL DATAS SHOW AND WHAT WERE MOST OFTEN TOALD TURNS OUT THAT AGAIN WORK IN BALSETASLAB BUT ALSO OTHER LABORATORIES HAS A A DRESSED WEATHER R NOT THE PROBABILITY OF ACHIEVING A GOAL GOES UP OR DOWN DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT ONE VISUALIZES OR SETS A GOAL THAT IS EASY MODERATE OR IMPOSSIBLE CAN IMPOSSIBLE GOAL WOULD BE FOR INSTANCE IF I SAY YOU KNOW I'M GOINGTO JUMP FROM MY FRONT DRIVEWAY ALL THE WAY UP TO THE ROAD THE ROADS QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY IT'S MORE THAN TWENTY MEATORS AWAY IS JUST NOC KCIN IT HAPPENS NI CN HAPPEN THIS LIFETIME AS NI HAPIN ANY OTHER LIFETIME NOT UNLESS IT INVOLVE SOME ELABORATE TECHNOLOGY THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF A JETPACK OR SOMETHING THAT IT'S JUST NOC KIN IT HAPPEN RIGHT AN EASY GOAL WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE CAN YOU JUMP OR COULD I JUMP N OA TOO FEET IN FRONT OF ME OBVIOUSLY YES OR CAN NOW MUSING A TRIVIAL EXAMPLE HERE BUT THIS COULD BE TRANSLATED TO ANY KIND OF GOAL SCHOOL GOAL PHYSICAL GOAL ET CETERA TURNS OUT THAT WHEN PEOPLE SET GOALS WHETHER NOT THEY ARE NUTRITIONAL GOALS EAT MORE OF THIS OR EAT LESS OF THAT WITH ANOTHER FITNESS GOALS IN A RUN MORE LIFT MORE SOME OTHER GOAL SWIM LESS SWIM MORE WHATEVER IT IS THEIR GAL HAPPENS TO BE SOME LEARNING GOAL SOME RELATIONSHIP GOAL SOME ATTEMPT TO MODIFY THEIR BEHAVIOR TURNS OUT THAT IF THE GOAL IS TOO EASY IT'S TOO WITHIN REACE IT DOESN'T RECRUIT ENOUGH OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TO MAKE PURSUIT OF THAT GOAL LIKELY NOW THAT MIGHT BE SURPRISING AT LEAST IT WAS SURPRISING TO ME YOU THINK WAL SOMETHING IS REALLY REALLY EASY IR AS A VERY LOW BAR TO ACHIEVE IT PEOPLE PROBABLY MORE LIKELY TO DO IT BUT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WHEN WE HEAR THAT A GOAL NEEDS TO BE INSPIRATIONAL WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE HEAR THAT SOMETHING'S TOO EASY TO RECRUIT OUR ACTION WHAT WE MEAN WELL THALSETASLAB MEASURED SOSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND FOUND THAT WHEN GOALS WERE TOO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO ATTAIN THEY DIDN'T GET THAT INCREASE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND RECRUITMENT OF THE OTHER NURL AND VASCULAR SYSTEMS MEANING THE BLOOD SYSTEMS AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WOULD PLACE THEM INTO ON GOING EFFORT AND SO THEY QUICKLY GAVE UP ALSO IF A GOAL WAS TOO LOFTY IF IT WAS TOO FAR FROM THEIR CURRENT ABILITIES IT DIDN'T RECRUIT ENOUGH SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE EVEN IF PEOPLE COULD GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING MENTALLY IT SIMPLY DIDN'T PLACE THEIR BODY INTO A STATE OF READINESS BECAUSE THEY IT WASN'T TANGIBLE THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY PERHAPS REALLY ACHIEVE IT SO IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN GOALS WERE MODERATE WHEN THEY WERE JUST OUTSIDE OF ONE'S IMMEDIATE ABILITIES OR THAT ONE FELT THAT YET THAT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT BUT IT'S WITHIN RANGE OR MAYBE IN RANGE LIKE MAYBE I CAN DO IT MAYBE I CANT THEN THERE WAS A NEAR DOUBLIN G OF THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE GOOD SENSE IT DIDN'T GO INTO THE UNHEALTHY RANGE AND AY DOUBLING OR MORE OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WOULD ENGAGE ING THE ONGOING PURSUIT OF THAT PARTICULAR GOAL SO HERE WOR TI AM A GOAL SETTING WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS SET GOALS THT ARE REALISTIC BUT THAT AREN'T SO REALISTIC THAT THEY'RE EASY THE GOALS NEED TO BE REALISTIC AND TRULY CHALLENGING DON'T SET GOALS THAT ARE SO CHALLENGING AND SO LOFTY THAT THEY CRASH THAT BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AND MAKE YOU OR ANY ONE FEEL UNMOTIVATED IN HEARING THIS IT MAKE SENSE BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE PREDICTED IT HAD THEY NOT DONE THIS VERY CONTROLLED STUDY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE LOFTIER THE GOAL THE BIGGER THE GOAL THE MORE THAT IT RECRUITS THE AUTONOMIC A SYSTEM AND THE MORE THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO LEAN INTO THE ENERGY AND EFFORT TO PURSUE AND ATTAIN THAT GOAL I ALSO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THA IF A GOAL IS REALLY EASY TO ACHIEVE THAT IT WOULD ENGAGE THE SYSTEMS OF ACTION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE WOULD SORT OF GET INTO MOTION AND PURSUE THAT GOAL BUT NEITHER IS THE CASE AGAIN SET GOALS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE BUT THAT ARE NOT SO LOFTY THAT THEY COLLAPSE YOUR SYSTEM AND THAT YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED AND THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT HOW WE PURCEIVE A GOAL WHETHER NOT WE THINK ITS WITHIN REACH OR NOT OF COURSE WILL VARY DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT WE ARE RESTED DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT OTHER ASPECTS OR OF OUR LIFE OR GOING WELL AND WE CAN THINK THAT WE ARE HOT ON THE HEELS OF A LIFETIME GOAL AND EVERYTHING'S GOING WELL AND THEN THERE'LL BE SOME CRISIS INTERPERSONAL CRISIS OR THERE'LL BE A HEALTH CRISIS AND YHER'LL BE SHUT DOWN AND THEN THAT GOAL SEEMS VERY VERY HARD TO ATTAIN SO WE WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO UPDATE GOALS UNDER DIFFERENT CONTECTS IN A FEW MINUTES BUT OF COURSE THIS IS GING TO BE AN AVERAGING THIS IS IN SOMETHING THAT YOU DO JUST ONCE BUT THE TAKE AWAY AGAIN IS VERY SIMPLE SET GOALS THAT ARE MODERATELY HARD TO HARD BUT NOT SO HARD NOR SO EASY THAT THEY DON'T ENGAGE YOUR BRAIN IN BODY PROPERLY MODERATE GOALS ARE BEST IF YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS NOW I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THREE PARTICULAREAS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY THAT POINT TO GOAL PURSUIT GOALAS ESSMENT AND GOAL ACHIEVEMENT PREVIOUSLY I TOLD YOU THAT IT'S GREAT TO FORESHADOW FAILURE THAT THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO GET YOUR SYSTEM INTO A STATE OF ACTIVATION I ALSO TOLD YOU THAT YOU WANT US SAT GOALS THAT ARE CHALLENGING BUT POSSIBLE AND AGAIN HERE ON PARAPHRASING FROM THE WORK OF EMILY BELLSET US OR ON TO BE VERY CLEAR THERE ARE FEW OTHER THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO IN ORDER TO BIAS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WILL SUCCEED IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS FIRST OF ALL LIMIT YOUR OPTIONS TRYING TO PURSUE TOO MANY GOALS AT ONCE CAN DEFINITELY BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE NOW I REALIZE THAT LIFE IS COMPLICATED WE ALL HAVE MULTIPLE GOALS THAT WERE TRYING TO PURSUE BUT IF WE HAVE PARTICULAR GOALS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO NOCK AT DISTRACTED BY OTHER GOALS AND MANY PEOPLE RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM SO SETTING ONE OR TWO OR MAYBE THREE MAJOR GOALS FOR A GIVEN YEAR IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE AND IS ACTALLY GING TO BE CHALLENGING FOR MOST PEOPLE OF COURSE WE HAVE DAILY GOALS AND MONTHLY GOALS AND YEARLY GOALS BUT IF WE HAVE BIG LOFTY GOALS WE NEED O BE CAREFUL NOT TO CONTAMINATE OUR MENTAL SPACE AND OUR VISUAL SPACE WITH TOO MANY GOALS AND WHY DO I SAY VISUAL GOALS WELL WHAT VERIOUS DEPARTMENT STORES AND SUPERMARKETS HAVE DISCOVERED IS THAT THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF THINGS IN OUR VISUAL ATTENTION THE MORE THAT WE CAN DRAW OR ATTENTION AND OUR GOALS OFF A LINE OF PURSUIT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL LET STING ABOUT IN THE PRACTICAL CONTECTS THIS AS ACTUALLY BEEN DONE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT IF THEY STOCK THEIR SHELVES CHALK OF BLOCK WITH MANY MANY OPTIONS OF FOOD OR CLOTHING ITEMS OR OBJECTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT PEOPLE SIMPLY BUY MORE STUFF PEOPLE ARE VERY PRONE TO ORIENTING THEIR ATTENTION TO WHATEVERS IN FRONT OF THEM YOU PUT A LOT OF STUFF IN FRONT OF THEM THEIR ATTENTION DRIFTS YOU PUT FEWER THINGS IN FRONT OF THEM THEIR ATTENTION IS MORE NARROW IN A LATER EPISODE WE'LL TALK ABOUT DESIGNING A WORK SPACE THAT'S OPTIMIZED ON THE BASIS OF THIS IT DOESN'T MEAN BEING IN AUR ROOM WITH NOTHING EXCEPT JUST YOUR DESK IN A COMPUTER DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT SPARSE BUT VISUAL SPARSENESS ACTUALLY CAN HELP US ORIENT OUR FOCUS AN OUR BEHAVIOR WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN OUR VISUAL ENVIRONMENT OR LOT OF THINGS IN OUR COGNIVE ENVIRONMENT IT'S THE SAME THING AND SO F YOU'RE GOING TO TRY IN PURSUE A FITNESS GOAL OF RELATIONSHIP GOAL AND ACADEMIC GOAL AND A LONG TERM LIFE FINANCIAL GOAL ALL AT ONCE THAT'S FOUR THINGS AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW YOU TO ISOLATE THOSE GOALS IN A VERY RIGID WAY AND IF YOU DO HAVE MULTIBL INTERLEAVING GOALS AND OVERLAPPING GOALS AND SIMULTANEOUS GOALS IN IF YEW MINUTES WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT A PROCESS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM TO A LINE TOWARDS EACH OF THOSE GOALS SEQUENTIALLY IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE THEM SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT SPECIFICITY OF GOALS WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT THE MORE SPECIFIC O GOAL IS AND THE MORE SPECIFIC WE ARE ABOUT WHEN AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO EXECUTE THAT GOAL THE HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND INDEED THAT'S THE CASE BUT THEREIS AN ADDITIONAL FEATURE THAT'S NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED THAT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT AND IN FACT MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN HAVING A SPECIFIC TIME OF DAY OR SPECIFIC END POINT IN MIND THE REALLY NICE STUDY THAT WAS DONE LOOKING AT RECYCLING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A NUMBER OF GROUPS BUSINESS IS HOUSEHOLDS AND INDIVIDUALS ARE TRYING TO DO MORE OF THEY'RE TRYING TO LOWER CARBON FOOTPRINT OR CONTRIBUTE TO OM THE WORLD IN SOME GENERAL WAY BY THROWING AWAY FEWER THINGS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE RECYCLE SO THIS HAS BEEN STUDIED AN THE CONTECTS OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENT WHERE A BUSINESS DECIDES AND LETS EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A GREATER EFFORT TOWARD RECYCLING CANS OR BOTTLES OR BOTTLES IN CANS ET CETERA AND THEN THE WAY THESE STUDIES WERE DONE IS THAT THE GANITORIAL STAFF WAS SWOPPED OUT TEMPORARILY F OR RECEARCHERS THAT ACTUALLY MEASURED THE NUMBER OF RECYCLABLE ITEMS THAT SHOWED UP IN THE TRASH AND NOT IN THE RECYCLE AS A FUNCTION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TRASH WHATE I SAY THE FUNCTION TOAL MOUND TRASH WHAT'S A WAY OF CONTROLLING FOR OM DIFFERENCES IN BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION FROM ONE WEEK THE NEXT ANYWAY THE POINT IS THEY WERE ABLE TO VERY CAREFULLY MEASURE HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE RECYCLING BEFORE AND AFTER THIS CALL TO ACTION TO RECYCLE MORE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS IF THEY SAID WE ARE GOING TO TRY IN RECYCLE MORE TRY NOT TO PUT CANS AND BOTTLES IN THE TRASH THERE OF COURSE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN RECYCLING BUT IT WAS PRETTY MODEST WHEREAS WHEN THERE WAS A VERY CONCRETE PLAN AND EVERYONE KNEW WAT THAT CONCRETE PLAN WAS FOR INSTANCE TO PLACE ALL BOTTLES AND CANS INTO THE RECYCLE NOT THE TRASH OR TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TRASH BY FIFTY PERCENT OR TO ELIMINATE ALL RECYCLABLE ITEMS FROM THE TRASH SO WHEN THEY MADE IT VERY CONCRETE EXACLY WHAT THE ACTION STEPS WERE THERE WAS A REMARKABLE I MAN CLOSE TO A HUNDREDFOLD OR MORE IMPROVEMENT IN RECYCLING BEHAVIOR THAT LASTED MANY MONTHS AFTER THIS CALL TO ACTION WAS MADE THE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD IT MEANS THAT HAVING A CONCRETE PLAN IS ESCENTIAL YOU CAN'T JUST SAY I' MEN TO BECOME A BETTER RECYCLER OR I MEN TO DO THINGS THAT ARE BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR I MEAN TO BECOME MORE PHYSICALLY FIT IT HAS TO BE A SPECIFIC SET OF ACTION STEPS THAT GET RIGHT DOWN TO DETAILS ABOUT WHAT SUCCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE DESCRIBED AS WHAT DOES RIGHT LOOK LIKE WHAT IS THE ACTUAL OUTCOME THAT ONE WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE IN TERMS OF ACTION STEPS SO NOT IN A CERLY FEELING STATES IT WASN'T THAT THEY ALL SAT AROUNDS THAT HOW GREAT WORLD EN A FEEL ABOUT OURSELVES IN THE WORLD WHEN WE COMPLISH THIS GOAL IT WAS VERY CONCRETE STATEMENTS VERY CONCRETE PLANS ABOUT ACTION STEPS THAT WOULD DELIVER ONE TO ONE'S GOAL SOMEWHAT STRAIGHTFORWARD AND AN INTUITIVE BUT NONE THE LESS WORTH WHILE IT IT WHAT IT SUGGESTS IS THAT FOR ALL OF US IF WE HAVE CERTAIN GOALS THT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE WE NEED TO BE EXQUISITELY DETAILED ABOUT WHAT THE ACTION STEPS ARE THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AND TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE THOSE ACTION STEPS SO THAT WE HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF MEETING THOSE ACTION STEPS SOME OF YOU MAY BE ASKING HOW OFTEN SHOULD ONE ASSESS PROGRESS WELL THAT OF COURSE WILL DEPEND ON THE GIVEN GOAL THAT YOUR TRYING TO PURSUE BUT IN THE STUDIES THAT I'VE BEEN REFERRING TO HEAR THE A CESSIMENT OF PROGRESS AND THE UPDATING OF CONCRETE PLANS WAS DONE WEAKLY SO IT SEEMS IKE WEAKLY IS A GOOD STARTING PLACE TO ADDRESS HOW WELL ONE PERFORMED IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK AND THEN BASED ON THAT PERFORMANCE THO UPDATE THE ACTION PLAN FOWARD THE UPCOMING WEEK SO WEAKLY SEEMS LIKE A GOOLD SOLID RULE OF THUMB FOR SETTING PARTICULAR ACTION GOALS AND ASCESSING ONE'S PROGRESS TOWARDS THE IMMEDIATE AND LONGER TERM GOALS ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT GOALS AND GOAL PURSUIT WOULD BE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MOLECULE DOPAMINE DOPAMINE IS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS THE MOLECULE OF PLEASURE AND REWARD BUT ACTUALLY IT IS THE MOLECULE OF MOTIVATION THIS IS BEST ILLUSTRATED BY A CLASSIC SET OF STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN BOTH ANIMALS AND IN HUMANS THE ANIMAL STUDY CAN BE DESCRIBED THE FOLLOWING WAY TWO RATS EACH IN A SEPARATE CAGE YOU CAN PROVIDE THOSE RATS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO INDULGE IN SOMETHING THAT THEY LIKE LIKE FOOD OR MATING OR HEAT IF ITS COLD IN THE ENVIRONMENT OR A COOL SPOT IN THE CAGE IF ITS WARM IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO FORTH IN WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT RATS WILL VERY READILY APPROACH THE REWARDING THING THEY WILL MATE THEY WILL EAT THEY WILL PURSUE SOMETHING THAT IS OF PLEASURE NOW IF YOU ARE TO TAKE ONE OF THOSE RATS AND DEPLETE ITS DOPAMI NURONS YOU CAN ELIMINATE ITS DOPAMINURONS OR BLOCK DOPAMING IN THE BRAIN WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THOSE ANIMALS WILL STILL ENJOY PLEASURE THEY WILL CONSUME THE FOOD THEY WILL MATE ET CETERA HOWEVER THEIR MOTIVATION TO ACHIEVE PLEASURE IS VASTLY REDUCED IN FACT IF YOU PLACE THE ITEM OF PLEASURE THE MATE THE FOOD ET CETERA EVEN JUST ONE RAT'S LENGTH AWAY FROM THAT RAT THE RAT WITHOUT DOPAMINE WILL NOT EVEN MOVE ONE LENGTH OF ITS OWN BODY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT PLEASURE AND THERE ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING EXPERIMENTS IN HUMANS THAT MIMIC THAT RESULT VERY ACCURATELY THERE ARE CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN HUMANS WHERE THERE IS A DEPLETION OF DOPAMINE IN WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE DEPLETION OF DOPAMINE DOES NOT INHIBIT AN ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE NECESSARILY IT INHIBITS AN ABILITY TO PURSUE OR GO THROUGH THE SERIES OF ACTION STEPS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PLEASURE SO DOPAMINE REALLY SITS AT THE HEART OF OUR MOTIVATIONAL STATE TO SEEK OUT GOALS AND TO SEEK PLEASURE AND THIS IS TRUE FOR IMMEDIATE GOALS THAT TAKE PLACE WITHIN A TIME FRAME OF MINUTES OR A TIE RAME OF A DAY OR THE TIEFRAME OF A WEEK OR THE TIMEFRAME OF A LIFETIME DOPAMINE IS THE COMMON CURRENCY BY WHICH WE PURSUE GOALS NOW DOPAMI DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE VERY INTERESTING I AM GAN DESCRIBE A FEW OF THEM AS THEY RELATE TO GOALL SEEKING BEHAVIORE FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE OF HOW OUR BRAIN RELEASES AND USES DOPAMINE THAT'S CALLED REWARD PREDICTION ERROR AND THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT DOPAMINE REWARD PREDICTION ERROR IS THAT DOPAMINE IS RELEASED IN THE GREATEST AMOUNT AND PLACE US AS INTO A GREATER STATE OF MOTIVATION WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT'S POSITIVE AND NOVEL NOW AN IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT DOPAMIE IS THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS RELEASED ON THE SAME SCHEDUAL THERE COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT DOPAMINE IS RELEASED AND WHEN IT IS RELEASED RELATIVE TO YOUR ANTICIPATION OF A REWARD IS KEY IF YOU DON'T EXPECT SOMETHING POSITIVE TO HAPPEN IT IS GOING ABOUT YOUR DAY AND SOMETHING POSITIVE HAPPENS DOPOMINE AND A LOT OF DOPOMINE IS RELEASED I HAD THIS HAPPENED REASENTLY I HAD NO IDEA THAT I WAS GOING TO BE RECEIVING SOMETHING IN THE MAL BUT I WENT TO THE MAL I LOOKED IN THE MAL AND I GOT SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE AND OUS REALLY REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS IS A REAL EVENT THAT HAPPENED JUST TODAY HOWEVER IF WE ANTICIPATE SOMETHING POSITIVE IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEN THAT THING HAPPENS WE EXPERIENCE DOPOMINE AS PART OF THE ANTICIPATION SO EVEN BEFORE WE GET THE REWARD THERE'S AN INCREASE IN DOPOMINE IT'S NOT AS HIGH AS IT WOULD BE IF SOMETHING REALLY NOVEL AND UNEXPECTED AND POSITIVE HAPPEN BUT WE DO GET AN INCREASE IN DOOMINE AND THEN WHEN WE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THE REWARD WE EXPERIENCE THE POSITIVE THING THERE'S A SMALLER INCREASE IN DOPOMINE OCASO AGAIN THE BIGGEST INCREASES IN DOPOMIN ARE RESPONSE TO THINGS THAT OR POSITIVE AND UNEXPECTED LESSER DOPOMINE IS RELEASED WHEN WE ANTICIPATE SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS YES WE GET SOME DOPOMINE AND WE ALSO GET SOME DOPOMING WHEN THE POSITIVE THING HAPPENS THINK ABOUT ANTICIPATING A GREAT MEAL WITH FRIENDS WE HAVE SOME DOPAMING CHURNING FRIENDS COME OVER THEN WE HAVE THE MEAL AND WE ALSO GET SOME DOPOMIN FROM THAT BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS WE WOULD IF IT AT ALL HAPPEND AS A PART OF A BIGS APPRISE THEN THERE'S ALSO THE CASE IN WHICH WE PREDICT THAT SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS THERE'S AN INCREASE IN DOPOMING JUST AS IT WAS BEFORE BUT THEN IF THAT THING DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR INSTANCE OUR FRIENDS DON'T SHOW UP FOR DINNER THEN THERE'S A DROP IN DOPOMING BELOW OUR INITIAL BASE LINE THAT DROP IN DOPOMINE IS THE CHEMICAL ESSENCE OF WHAT WE CALL THIS APPOINTMENT NOW THIS DOPOMINE REWARD PREDICTION ERROR AS IT'S CALLED CAN BE LEVERAGED TOWARD TRYING TO REACH OUR GOALS BECAUSE IT TELLS US WHERE WE SHOULD SET OUR MILESTONES WE CAN'T BE IN A MODE OF SIMPLY BEING FOCUSED ON THE FINISHED LINE VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO THAT OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN A WAY THAT'S EFFECTIVE NOW EARLIER I TALKED ABOUT A STUDY WHERE PEOPLE WERE FOCUSSED ON A FINISHD LINE VISUALLY AND THEY WERE MOVING THROUGH SPACE WITH THESE ANKLE WAITS ON BUT THAT WAS A VERY SHORT TERM GOAL OCHAESO IF A GOAL IS WITHIN YOU KNOW MINUTES OR MAYBE EVEN WITHIN AN HOUR ORIS IN WITH OUR MEDIATE VISUALS OF ENVIRONMENT MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT BUT MOST GOALS OF THE SORT THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE PURSUING FITNESS GLLS ACADEMIC GULLS BUSINESS GULLS RELATIONSHIP GULLS ET CETERA INVOLVE SOME MILESTONES SO UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT REWARD PREDICTION ERR WE CAN MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT WERE TO PLACE THE MILESTONES HOW FAR OUT IN THE FUTURE TO PLACE MILESTONES SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW OFTEN OR AT WHAT INTERVALS SHOULD ONE ASSESS PROGRESS AND IT TURNS OUT THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE BUT THAT THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE IT OBJECTIVE NOW IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE OF THE UVEMAN LABPODCASS I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THE GREAT ROBERT'S APPOLSKI AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN CAN SUBJECTIVELY CHANGE WHETHER NOT A GIVEN BEHAVIOR OR EXPERIENC IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE AND THE EXAMPLE THAT ROBERT GAVE AS A REALLY PHENOMENAL ONE IT'S A A STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE IN RATS AND ALSO IN HUMANS WHERE IT TOOK A RAT THEY HAD A RAT RUN ON A RUNNING REAL RATS TURNS OUT LIKE TO RUN ON RUNNING WHEELS AND THE BLOOD PRESSURE OF THAT ANIMAL THE HEALTH METRICS FOR THAT ANIMAL THE LIPID PROFILES MANY MANY THINGS IMPROVED O GAY THE RAT WAS EXERCISING AND IT GOT HEALTHIER AND PRESUME LE GOT HAPPIER WE DON'T KNOW WE COULD HAVE ASKED IT BUT WE WOULDN'T KNOW DOES'T KNW HOW TO TELL US BUT WE CAN MEASURE BLOODLIPIDS WE CAN MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND INDEED WHEN THAT RAT EXERCISED OR WHEN PEOPLE EXERCISE THEY GENERALLY GET HEALTHIER EXCEPT IN THAT PARTICULAR EXPERIMENT THEY HAD ANOTHER ANIMAL WHERE EVERY TIME RAT NUMBER ONE RAN RAT NUMBER TO WAS FORCED TO RUN IT WAS ON A RUNNING WHEEL AND IT WAS FORCED TO RUN NOT BECAUSE IT WANTED TO BUT BECAUSE IT WAS FORCED TO AND WHAT WAS REMARKABLE IS THAT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF BEING FORCED TO DO SOMETHING WE'RE IN THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AS THEY WERE WHEN THOSE SAME BEHAVIORS WERE UNDERTAKEN VOLUNTARILY IN OTHER WORDS THE RAT THAT WAS CHOOSING TO RUN GOT HEALTHIER AND THE RAT THAT WAS FORCED TO RUN BECAME UNHEALTHY BLOOD PRESSURER WENT UP IN A DIRECTION THAT WASN'T EFFECTIVE AND USEFUL BLOODLIP HAS GOT WORSE STRESSHARMONS WENT UP ET CETERA ET CETERA AND YOU SEE THE SAME THING IN HUMANS NOW WHAT THIS SAYS IS THAT OUR SUBJECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHY WE ARE DOING SOMETHING IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE EFFECTS THAT WE WILL GET FROM THAT BEHAVIOR AND INDEED THE EFFECTS OF THAT BEHAVIOR WILL HAVE ON US SO THIS HAS TO MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FIRST OF ALL INTERMS OF REWARD SCHEDULES WE CAN DECIDE TO USE ANY REWARD SCHEDUAL THAT WE WANT FOR A GIVEN BEHAVIOR WE CAN DECIDE THAT THE MILESTONES FOR A LET'S SAY A PLAN OF GETTING IN REALLY TERRIFIC PARTY OF ASCULAR SHAPE OVER THE NEXT YEAR WE CAN DECIDE TO ASCESS EVERY DAY AND ASK OURSELVES HOW GOOD WAS OUR PROGRESS AND IF WE MADE PROGRESS THAN WERE CAN REWARD OURSELVES WE COULD DO THAT EVERY THIRD DAY WE COULD DO IT EVERY WEEK WE COULD DO IT EVERY FIVE MINUTES IF WE ACTULLY HAVE THE TIME TO DO THAT THE REWARD SCHEDUAL THE DOPEMING SYSTEM IS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS THESE SO CALL TOP DOWN EFFECTS OF WHEN WE DECIDE THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR US IF WE ANALYZE IT ON A GIVEN TIME FRAME WELL THEN IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR US SO WHAT I SUGGEST PEOPLE DO IS PICK A PARTICULAR INTERVAL AT WHICH THEY ARE GOING TO ASSESS PROGRESS AND IF YOU'VE BEEN MAKING REGULAR PROGRESS TOWARDS A GOAL THAT YOU REWARD YOURSELF AND THE REWARD INDEED IS ALL COGNITIVE IT'S ALL MENTAL ITS TELLING YOURSELF YES I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK NOW SOME PEOPLE SAY WAIT BUT I WANT TO NO EXACTLY HOW OFTEN I SHOULD DO THAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT AT AN INTERVAL THAT YOU CAN MAINTAIN CONSISTENTLY OKAESA YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REWARD YOURSELF EVERY MINUTE  WERE EVERY STEP OF EVERY JOG THAT YOU TAKE UNLESS YOU CAN DO IT EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY STEP OF EVERY JOG THAT YOU TAKE FOR THAT REASON I THINK THAT MUT THAT DAILY OR IDEALLY WEEKLY ASSESSMENTS ARE G OING TO BE BEST I THINK THAT CHECKING IN AT THE END OF A WEEK LOOKING BACK ON THE PREVIOUS WEEK AND ASSESSING HOW WELL YOU PERFORMED IN PURSUIT OF A GIVEN GOAL HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK YOU RAN OR HOW MANY TIMES YOU STUDIED OR HOW MANY TIMES YOU DID SOMETHING HAT YOU WANTED TO DO OR AVOIDED SOMETHING TAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO I THINK THAT TO REASONABLE AND TRACTABLE SCHADULE TO ASSESS ONCE A WEEK SO THAT'S ONE POINT THAT PICK A MILESTONE THAT YOU CAN MAINTAIN CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE PURSUIT OF A GOAL THE SECOND THING IS THAT THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS THAT WERE DESCRIBED BY THAT SUPOLSKY STUDY OR THAT SUPULSKY DESCRIBED RATHER OR ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR ALL ASPECTS OF GOAL SEEKING BEHAVIOR WE CANNOT UNDER ESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM AND OUR SENSE OF WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK IS UNDER OUR COGNATIVE CONTROL IF WE CONSTANTLY PLACE OURSELF INTO A MODE OF THINKING THAT WE ARE FAILING WELL THEN INDEED WE ARE NOT GOING TO TURN OUT MUCH DOPAMI NOW EARLIER I SAID WE NEED TO PREDICT AND VISUALIZE FAILURE BUT THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING AS THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES AS FAILING WE NEED TO PREDICT WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE IF WE FAILED BUT THEN IN COUNTERING THAT AND IN BEHAVING IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THINKING IN A CERTAIN WAY IND PURSUING OUR GOALS IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY MAY BE CHECKING IN ON THAT EACH WEEK WE DEFINITELY NEED TO REWARD OURSELFS COGNITIVELY FOR THE CORRECT AND SUCCESSFUL PURSUIT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT ANTICIPATE AND THINK ABOUT FAILURE AS A MECHANISM OF GENERATING MOTIVATION AND INDEED FEAR AND ANXIETY SO THAT YOU LEAN INTO THE CORRECT BEHAVIORS AND YOU LEAN AWAY FROM THE INCORRECT BEHAVIORS TO REACH YOUR GOAL BUT THEN WEAKLY OR SO WHATEVER YOU CAN MAINTAIN CONSYSTENTLY YOU ABSOLUTELY WANT TO REWARD YOURSELF COGNIVELY BY TELLING YOURSELF I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK I GOT ANOTHER WEEK WHERE I ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER IT IS THAT I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH A CONCRETE EXAMPLE THAT I'M FOLLOWING NOW AS THIS HUNDRE AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED MINUTES OF ZONE TWO CARDIO PER WEEK BECAUSE THAT SHOWN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN INPROVING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH METRICS SO ONCE A WEK ALL CHECKEN WITH MYSELF IF I REACH THAT HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO HUNT TO TWO HUNDRED MENUTE THRESHOLD THEN I'LL REWARD MYSELF SIMPLY BY CHECKING OFF ABOXION SAYING OKE I'M ON TRACK I'M ON TRACK UM ON TRACK THIS DOPAMINE SYSTEM IS CRITICAL TO RE UP TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE ARE ON TRACK IF INDEED WE ARE E ON TRACK BECAUSE DOPAMINE ITSELF PROVIDES A STATE OF MOTIVATION AND READINESS TO CONTINUE IN THE REGULAR PURSUIT OF OUR GOALS DOPAMINE THE MOLECULE IS ACTUALLY USED TO MANUFACTURE EPINEFRAN IN NORAPANEFRAN WHICH ARE OTHER MOLECULES IN OUR BRAIN AN BODY WHICH PUT US INTO THAT READINESS AND ACTION STATE THEY ARE ACTUALLY THE MOLECULES THAT HELP GENERATE THAT INCREASE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE THAT PUT IT PUTS US INTO A STATE OF READINESS SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT DOPAMINE AS A SELF AMPLIFYING SYSTEM PROVIDED THAT YOU ARE  LEVERAGING THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM ON A CONSYSTENT SCHADULE NOW BY ALSO FOLLOWING A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE OF SELF REWARD YOU SET YOURSELF UP FOR ANY POSITIVE UNANTICIPATED REWARDS THAT MAY HAPPEN SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOUARE CHECKING IN WITH YOURSELF WEAKLY TELLING YOURSELF THAT YOU'R DOING WELL IF INDEED YOU ARE AND THEN OUT OF NOWHERE FOR INSTANCE YOU'RE OUT ON A RUN OR YOURE DOING SOMETHING I AMUSING FITNESS AS EXAMPLE BY YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING YOU FIND YORSELF PERFORMING PARTICULARLY WELL THAT'S A UNEXPECTED DOPAMIE REWARD THAT WILL FURTHER AMPLIFY THE SYSTEM NOW KNOW MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVING HEARD ME TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE BEFORE WORRY WELL CAN I RELEASE TOO MUCH DOPAMINE AND THEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM WILL CRASH AND THEN I'LL RUN OUT O MOTIVATION IN GENERAL THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN UNLESS PEOPLE ARE USING FARMACOLOGY SUPPLEMENTS OR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR ELICIT DRUGS TO INCREASED DOPAMINE THIS IS WHY I'M A BIG FAN OF THINGS LIKE COLD SHOWERS AND COLD WATER EXPOSURE WAS WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO LONG LASTING TOO POINT FIVE EX INCREASES IN DOPAMIE OR IN SOME CASES SUPPLEMENTATION WITH THINGS LIKE ALTIRASINE WHICH OUR CRECURSERS TO DOPAMINE OR IN SOME CASES CAFINE WHICH CAN INCREASED THE NUMBER OF DOPAMINE RECEPTORS THAT WE HAVE SO THAT WHATEVER DOPIN WE HAVE FLOATING AROUND CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN ACTIVATING THESE MODEOFATIONAL STATES BUT THINGS THAT REALLY INCREASE DOPAMINE AND THEN CAUSE IT TO CRASH CAN BE PROBLEMATIC ONE WAY TO CONCEIVE OF DOPAMINE IS AS A SORT OF DOPAMINE WAVEPOOL YOU PROBLISING THESE WAVEPOOLS WHERE SOME PRESSURER IS PUSHED INTO THE POOL THAN YOU GET THESE WAVES GOING IF THOSE WAVES ARE CONSISTENT ENOUGH BUT THAT AND THE'RE OF HIGH ENOUGH AMPLITUDE THE WAVES CAN CONTINUE TO GO UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN BUT IF IT'S A GIANT WAVE IF YOU GET A HUGE BLAST OF DOPAMINE WELL THEN A BUNCH OF THE WATER SLOSHES OUT OF THE WAVEPOOL AND THEN YOU BASIDLY HAVE TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF RESET THAT DOPAMINE LEVEL THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN ADDICTION AND WHEN PEOPLE START PUSHING IN A LOT OF A DRUGS OR OTHER THINGS INTO THE SYSTEM THAT INCREASE DOPAMINE TOO MUCH SO TO DAY WE'VE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BEEN TALKING ABOUT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS IT IS POSSIBLE TO INCORPORATE SUPPLEMENT SEND THINGS TO THAT SORT THAT CAN INCREASED DOPAMINE AS A WAY TO GETTING INTO ON GOING MOTIVATIONAL STATES BUT I CAUTION PEOPLE IN ABOUT RELYING ON THOSE TOO MUCH REALLY WHAT YOU WANT IS YOU WANT A SITUATION WHERE YOUR OWN POSITIVE FEED BACK YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ARE REACHING THE MILESTONES THAT YOU'VE SET OUT FOR YOURSELF THAT YOU'R ACHIEVING THOSE AND THAT IS WHAT'S CAUSING THESE WAVES ARE THESE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THAT WILL FURTHER AMPLIFY YOUR MODE OFATIONAL STATES ANOTHER VERY INTERESTING ASPECT OF DOPAMINE THAT I'VE NOT TALKED ABOUT AT ALL ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE IS ACTUALLY HOW THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM INTERACTS WITH THE VISUAL SYSTEM WEV TALKED A LOUT ABOUT HOW HARNESSING YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION TO A PARTICULAR POINT IS GRAT AND CAN HELP SERVE YOURE ABILITY TO BOTH SET AND ACHIEVE GOALS REALLY WONDERFUL WORK THAT WAS DONE BY WOLFROM SHOALTS WHOSE ONE OF THE GREAT PIONEERS IN THIS AREA OF DOPAMINE AND DOPAMINE REWARD PREDICTIONERY SHOWED THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT OF NORMAL LEVELS OF DOPAMINE THEIRE VISUAL SEARCH MEANIY HOW THEY SCANDIVISUAL ENVIRONMENTS TENDS TO BE PRETTY CONSTRAINED THEY MIGHT MOVE THEIR EYES AROUND O PARTICULAR VISUAL VIRONMENT SEARCHING SOMEWHAT FOR PEOPLE THAT LACK DOPOMNE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT OF THEIR EYES THEY DON'T ACTUALLY TEND TO LOOK VERY FAR INTO THE HORIZON THERE DON'T HAVE THAT VERY FOCUS VIRGENCS POINT THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF AI GUESS FOR LACK OF A BETTER PHRASIC AN EY OF THE TIGER FOCUS ON A GOAL RATHER THEIR I MOVEMENTS ARE DEPLEATED AND THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY EVALUATING HORIZONS OFTEN THEIR FUTURE THEY'RE NOT FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE EXTRA EXTRAPERSONAL SPACE AND THIS ACTALLY CAN BE RESTORED IN SOME OF THESE TOOK PLACE IN PARKINS IN SPATIONS AND OTHER PEOPLE OF DOPOMINE TO PLEADED THAT WHEN DOPAMIN IS RESTORED PHARMICALOGICALLY THEIR VISUAL FOCUS IS RE ENHANCED AGAIN NOW THERE ARE LOT OF DETAILS TO THE STUDY THAT DON'T MAT PERFECTLY ON TO EVERYTHING THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT BUT THE POINT IS THIS WHEN WE ARE FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR POINT IN VISUAL SPACE OR IS PARTICULAR GOAL OR HORIZON ALL THOSE SYSTEMS ARE BLOOD PRESSURE EPINEFERAN END INDEED DOPAMINE GET RECRUITED TO PUT US INTO A STATE OF READINESS AND WILLINGNESS TO GO PURSUE THINGS IN THAT EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE WHEN OUR VISUAL ATTENTION IS VERY DIFFUSE ALL OF THAT RELAXES AND WE TEND TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE STAYING IN THE PLACE THAT WE ARE IN OUR PERIPERSONAL SPACE AND THE EFFECT WORKS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOO WHEN DOPAMINE IS INCREASED ARE VISUAL ATTENTION FOR PARTICULAR THINGS OUT IN SPACE INCREASE SO THE WAY IT WORKS IS RECIPROCAL WHEN WE USE OUR VISUAL SYSTEM IN A PARTICULAR WAY BRING IT TO A POINT OF FOCUS IT RECRUITS CHEMICAL AND NURAL SYSTEMS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT PUT US INTO A STATE OF READINESS IN PURSUIT AND WHEN WE INCREASE CERTAIN CHEMICALS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY LIKE EPANEFERAND LIKE DOPOMINE THEN WE ALSO ALLOW OUR VISUAL SYSTEM TO BE IN A STATE OF LOOKING OUT AT PARTICULAR LOCATIONS IN OUR VISUAL WORLD SO THE SYSTEM WORKS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND SOME PEOPLE LEVERAGE THIS BY USING THINGS LIKE KAFFINE OR TAKING THNGS LIKE ELTIRICINE TO INCREASE DOPOMINE AND AGAIN IT WORKS BOTH WAYS THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG WAY TO DO IT I AM A PARTICULAR FAN OF USING BEHAVIORAL TOOLS ALWAYS PRIOR TOO USING SUPPLEMENTATION OR ANY KINDS OF OTHER TOOLS BECAUSE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS HAVE A VERY UNIQUE FEATURE THAT SUPPLEMENTATION AND OTHER CHEMICAL TOOLS DON'T WHICH IS THAT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS USED OVER TIME ENGAGE NERAL PLASTICITY AS WE START TO PRACTISE USING OUR VISUAL SYSTEM TO HARNESS OUR ATTENTION TO PARTICULAR LOCATIONS AND IN THAT WAY MOVE TOWARD PARTICULAR GOALS WE GET BETTER AN BETTER AT USING THOSE SYSTEMS IN FACT THE SYSTEMS FOR FOCUS AND MOTIVATION THEMSELVES HAVE PLASTICITYE TO WE GET BETTER AT BEING MOTIVATED IN FOCUS WHEN WE PLACE OUR VISUAL ATTENTION AT A GIVEN LOCATION USING CHEMICAL ASSYSTANCE OF A SAFE KIND OF COURSE CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BUT THINGS LIKE ELTIRISINE OR CAFFINE ORE THOSE COMBINED YES IT WILL INCREASE DOPOMINE AN WILL INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN VISUAL FOCUS SOMEWHAT BUT THOSE COMPOUNDS ALONE DON'T MODIFY THE CIRCUITRIES IN THE WAY THAT WE WANT SO I ALWAYS SAY BEHAVIORAL TOOLS FIRST THEN NUTRITIONAL TOOLS THEN SUPPLEMENTATION TOOLS AND HAND IF IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU IN SAFE MAY BE YOU ADVANCED INTO SOME OF THE OTHER MORE SOPHISTICATED TOOLS I'D LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY RECAP WHAT I'VE COVERED UP UNTIL NOW AND AGAIN EMPHASIZED THAT MUCH OF WHAT I'VE COVERED HAS BEEN BASED ON THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF EMILY BALSET US AND COLLEAGUES YO HOPE TO GET HER AS A GUEST ON THE PODCAST BY THE WAY FIRST OF ALL SET GOALS THAT ARE CHALLENGING BUT POSSIBLE THOSE MODERATE GOALS NOT SUPEREASY NOT SUPERDIFFICUL BUT MODERATE LY CHALLENGING GOALS SEEM TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN MOVING PEOPLE TOWARDS THEIR GOALS OVER THE SHORT AND LONG TERM SECOND PLAN CONCRETELY YOU NEED A CONCRETE SET OF ACTIONS THAT YOU'RE GON TO FOLLOW IN ORDER TO REACH YOUR GOALS THIRD FORESHADOW FAILURE THIS IS A SOMEWHAT SURPRISING ONE TO ME I WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED THAT IMAGINING SUCCESS IS THE WAY TO GO IT TURNS OUT THAT IMAGINING SUCCESS IN VISUALIZING SUCCESS CAN BE USEFUL AT THE OUTSET OF A GOAL AND MAY BE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IN PURSUIT OF THAT GOAL BUT THAT IT'S NOT TERRIFIC FOR PUTTING YOU IN CONSTANT PURSUIT OF THAT GOAL RATHER FORESHADOWING FAILURE VISUALIZING FAILURE IN ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT IT'S GOING TO BRING SEEMS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN THAT MAPS VERY WELL TO WHAT'S KNOWN ABOUT THE NARL CIRCUITRY IN THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE EMIGDULA FOCIS ON PARTICULAR VISUAL POINTS AS A WAY TO HARNESS YOUR ATTENTION AND TO REMOVE DISTRACTORS REMOVING DISTRACTORS IN GETTING YOUR BODY AND BRAIN INTO A MODE OF ACTIVATION GETTING THAT HEALTHY INCREASE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE THAT PUTS YOU IN TO FORWARD MOTION TOWARDS YOUR GOALS IS ABSOLUTELY KEY SO THAT'S A BRIEF SUMMARY OF WHAT I'VE COVERED UP UNTIL NOW THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TOO OF COURSE THE DOPEMINE SYSTEM MEN THE POWER OF SUBJECTIVE TOP DOWN CONTROL IN REGULATING THAT DOPENINE SYSTEM BUT I WANT TO BE SURE TO INCLUDE A TOOL THAT'S BEEN ESPECIALLY POWERFUL FOR ME THAT'S GROUNDED IN THE NARRO SCIENCE TO SEARCH AND IN THE PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND AS I DESCRIBE THIS TOOL NEXT I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE WAYS IN WHICH IT MESHES NICELY WITH THE WORK THAT EMIL BALSET US AND COLEAGUES HAVE DONE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE PERSONALLY BEEN DOING FOR MANY YEARS BASED AN MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND THE UNDERSTANDING THAT INDEED WE CAN MOVE OUR COGNITION AND OUR PERCEPTION FROM A PLACE OF INTERROCEPTION AND FOCUSING ON OUR PERRY PERSONAL SPACE THAT SPACE WITHIN US IN IMMEDIATELY AROUND US AND ON THE THINGS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE TO US THAT WE CAN SHIFT FROM THAT MODE TO THIS MODE OF EXTROCEPTION OF FOCUSING ON THINGS OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF OUR SKIND AND THAT ARE BEYOND OUR REACH THAT ARE LITERALLY GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOURS IN GOAL DIRECTED THOUGHTS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THT IN THE PAST I AVE TALKED ABUT A LITTLE BIT IHAVE TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED SPACE TIME BRIDGING IN IT WE HAVEN'T TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE TIME DOMAIN OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM TO DAY BUT SPACE TIME BRIDGING IS SIMPLY AWAY OF USING ONE'S VISUAL SYSTEM TO FOCUS ON THE PERRY PERSONAL SPACE AND IN TERRECEPTION AND THEN GRADUALLY IN A DELIBERATE WAY STEPPING ONE'S FOCUS INTO THE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE AND THEN BACK TO THE PERY PERSONAL SPACE IN A WAY THAT GIVES YOU A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND CONTROL OVER THAT ABILITY IN YOUR DAILY LIFE SO I'M IN THE FIRST DESCRIBE THE TOOL AND THEN I WILL EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE UNDERLYING SCIENCE AND THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM HERE'S HOLL YOU WOULD DO THIS YOU COULD DO THIS INDOORS OR OUTDOORS ALTHOUGH IDEALLY YOU WOULD DO IT IN A LOCATION WHERE YOU COULD VIEW A HORIZON IT CULD BE THROUGH WINDOW OR IDEALLY OUTDOORS WITHOUT A WINDOW COULD BE DONE ANY TIME OF DAY AT NIGHT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING BUT IT GOES THE FOLLOWING WAY YOU FIRST YOU IS YOU WOULD CLOSE YOUR EYES THIS COULD BE DONE SEADER STANDING BUT YOU WOULD CLOSE YOUR EYES AND YOU WOULD FOCUS AS MUCH OF YOUR ATTENTION INCLUDING YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION ON YOUR INNER LANDSCAPE ON YOUR INTERROCEPTION SO THAT WOULD BE YOUR BREATHING YOUR HEART RAT MAY BEVEN THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN BUT REALLY FOCUSSING INTERNALLY NOW HOW CAN YOU FOCUS YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION INTERNALLY IF YOUR EYES ARECLOSE WELL YOU DO THAT BY IMAGINING YOUR INNER LANDSCAPE OCHA SO YOU DNOVT TO IMAGINE YOUR HEART BEATING AND SO FORTH BUT WHAT YOUR TRYING TO DO IS A LIMINATE PERCEPTION OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD YOUR LIMINATING EXTEIR ASTEPTION AND YOUR FOCUSSING ALL OF YOUR COGNIVE ATTENTION AND YOUR PERCEPTIAL ATTENTION ON WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF YOUR SKIN OR AT THE LEVEL OF THE SURFAS OF YOUR SKIN AND INSIDE YOUR BODY AND YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR A DURATION OF A PROXIMATELY THREE SLOW BREATHS OC SO CLOSE YOUR EYES YOU WOULD DO BREATH ONE BREATH TOO AND BREATH THREE CONCENTRATING ALL YOURATTENTION ON Y U INTERNAL LANDSCAPE THEN YOU WOULD OPEN YOUR EYES AND YOU WOULD FOCUSS YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION ON SOME AREA ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR BODY SO FOR ME THE WAY THAT I TYPICALLY DO THIS WILL BE TO FOCUS ON SAY THE PALM OF MY HAND SWHILE FOCUS MY VISUAL ATTENTION ON THE PALL MY HEN AND I THEN DO THREE BREATHS AGAIN FOCUSING ON MY INTERNAL STATE BUT NOW I'M SPLITTING OUT A LITTLE BIT OF MY ATTENTION FROM INTERROCEPTION TO EXTRAROCEPTION FOCUSSING ON SOMETHING OUTSIDE ME THE RATIO OR THE SPLIT OF ATTENTION IS ABOUT NINETY TEN ABOUT NINETY PER CENT OF MY ATTENTION IS FOCUSED INTERNALLY BUT I'M ALSO FOCUSSING SOME OF MY ATTENTION EXTERNALLY MOST PEOPLE CAN O THIS PRETTY EASILY THEN THERE'S A THIRD WHAT I CALL STATION I NOW MOVE MY VISUAL ATTENTION TO OUTSIDE MY BODY TO SOME LOCATION IN THE ROOM OR IF I 'M OUTSIDE IN THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT SOMETHING IN THE RANGE OF FIVE TO FIFTEEN FEET AWAY AND I'M TRYING TO MOVE NINETY PERCENT OF MY ATTENTION TO THAT EXTERNAL OBJECT SO NOW I'M REALLY BIASING MY PERCEPTION AND MY ATTENTION TOWARDS EXTEROCEPTION AS I BREATHE ON PAYING ATTENTION TO THOSE THREE BREATHS SO THAT'S WHY THERERE STILL TEN PERCENT THAT'S FOCUSSED ON MY INTERNAL LANDSCAPE BECAUSE I WANT O PAY ATTENTION OF THOSE THREE BREATHS BUT I'M FOCUSSING AS MUCH OF MY ATTENTION A OUTSIDE OF MYSELF MAINTAINING JUST A LITTLE BIT ON MY INTERNAL STATES I CAN MEASURE THE CADENCE OF THOSE THREE BREATHS THEN I MOVE MY VISUAL ATTENTION TO YET ANOTHER STATION WHICH IS FURTHER AWAY TYPICALLY A HORIZON OR SOMETHING AS FAR OFF IN THE DISTANCE AS I CAN POSSIBLY SEE AGAIN FOR THE DURATION OF THREE BREATHS AND AT THAT POINT I'M TRYING MY VERY BEST TO MOVE NINETY NINE IF NOT A HUNDRED PER CENT OF MY ATTENTION TO THAT EXTERNAL LOCATION AND THEND WHAT I TYPICALLY WILL DO IS I WILL TRY AND EXPAND BOTH MY VISION AND MY COGNITION TO A MUCH BROADERS HERE THIS IS THAT MAGNACELLAR VISION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHERE I'M NOT FOCUSING ON A PARTICULAR LOCATION ON THE HORIZON I'M TRYING TO DILATE THE APERTURE OF MY FIELD OF EWSO I CAN SEE AS MUCH OF THE VISUAL LANDSCAPE AS I'MIN AS POSSIBLE IF YOU'RE IN AN INTERNAL ON EXCUSE ME IF YOU ARE IN INDOORS THEN THAT MIGHT BE THE SEALING THE WALLS AND THE FLOOR OF THE ENVIRONMEN YOURIN IF YOUR OUT DOORS IT WOULD BE TO EXPAND YOUR VISUAL FOCUS AS BROADLY AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN AGAIN FOR THE DURATION OF THREE BREATHS THEN I WOULD RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO MY INTERNAL LANDSCAPE I WOULD CLOSE MY EYES AND I WOULD DO THREE MORE BREATHS FOCUSSING ENTIRELY ON MY INTERROCEPTION ON MY INTERNAL LANDSCAPE OR WHAT WE CALL BEFORE IT MY PERY PERSONAL SPACE AND I WOULD THEN REPEAT THAT PERRY PERSONAL SPACE  HUNDRED PER CENT FOCUSED ON MY HAND NINETY PER CENT TEN PER CENT ON MY PERRY PERSONAL SPACE FOR MY INTERNAL LANDSCAPE STEPPING OUT TO ANOTHER LOCATION WHERE IT'S MOSTLY EXTEROCEPTION MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF OF RECOGNITION OF MY INTERNAL SCAPE THEN TO THE HORIZON THEN TO THIS BROADER VISUAL SPHERE THAN BACK INTO MY BODY AND I WOULD WORK THROUGH EACH OF THOSE STATIONS MAY BE TWO OR THREE TIMES THE ENTIRE THING TAKES ABOUT NINETY SECONDS TO THREE MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW MANY BREATHS YOU DO I SAID THREE BUT YOU COULD DO ONE OR TEN IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER OR IT'S ALSO CAN TO DEPEND ON FOR INSTANCE HOW SLOWLY YOUR BREATHING CAUSE YOU AR BREATHING MIGHT BE FASTER THAN MINE OR ISE FERSA WHAT IS ALL OF THIS DOING WHY DO I CALL THE SPACE TIME BRIDGING AND WISEST USEFUL FOR GOAL SETTING THE REASON I CALL IT SPACE TIME BRIDGING IS THAT THE VISUAL SYSTEM IS NOT JUST ABOUT ANALYZING SPACE IT'S ACTUALLY HOW WE BATCH TIME ITS HOW WE CARVE UP TIME AND THE SIMPLE WAY TO STATE THIS IS THAT WHEN WE FOCUS OUR VISUAL ATTENTION ON A VERY NARROW POINT THAT'S CLOSE TO OUR BODY AND OUR IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE WE TEND TO SLICE UP TIME VERY FINELY WE ARE FOCUSED ON OUR BREATHING WERE FOCUSSED ON OUR HEART BEATS IN FACT OUR BREATHING AND OUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE AND OUR HEART BEATS BECOME THE SORT OF SECOND HAND IF YOU WILL ON OUR EXPERIENCE WE ARE CARVING UP TIME ACCORDING TO OUR IMMEDIATE PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE WHEREAS WHEN WE FOCUSS OUR VISUAL ATTENTION OUTSIDE OUR BODY NOT ONLY DO WE ENGAGE THAT EXTERACEPTIVE EXTRA PERSONAL SPACE SYSTEM AND WE STARE TO ENGAGE THE DOPOMING SYSTEM THE GOAL DIRECTED SYSTEM BUT WE ALSO START BATCHING TIME DIFFERENTLY WHEN WE FOCUS OUR VISUAL SYSTEM INTO A BROADER SPHERE OF SPACE OR INTO A SPACE BEYOND THE CONFINES OF OUR SCIN WE START CARVING UP TIME OUR FRAME RATE CHANGES NOW THIS IS USEFUL IN THE CONTEXT OF GOAL SETTING GOAL ASSESSMENT AN GOAL PURSUIT BECAUSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY FEW ISOLATED EXAMPLES ALMOST ALL GOALS INVOLVE SETTING SOME GOAL THAT'S OFTEN THE FUTURE AND THEN CARVING UP THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THAT GOAL INTO MILESTONES THAT RANGE IN DURATION AND THE REWARDS EVEN IF WE TRYING JUST MAKE THEM EVERY WEEK ARE GOING TO COME AT SOME UNEXPECTED INTERVALS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY CAN BE HELPFUL FOR REENFORCING BEHAVIOR INTERMIT REWARD THAT'S INTERMITTENT AND RANDOM IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE REWARD SCHEDUAL WE KNOW BUT THE PROBLEM IS ALWAYS HOW DO WE KEEP OUR COGNITION IN LINE WITH THE LONG TERM GOAL WHILE ALSO BEING FOCUST ON THESE MORE IMMEDIATE GOALS AND SO THIS PARTICULAR PRACTICE THAT I CALL SPACETIME BRIDGING BUT WE CAN GIVE IT A DIFFERENT NAME I'M SURE THEYAR BETTER NAMES WHEN WE CAN SUGGEST SOME IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOU TOB THAT ARE MORE ACCURATE OR MORE A MAP TO IT BETTER BUT THIS BEHAVIOR OR THIS PRACTISE RATHER IS TEACHING US TO USE OUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND THEREBY OUR COGNIVE SYSTEM AND THEREBY OUR REWARD SYSTEMS TO ORIENT TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN SPACE AND THEREFORE T DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN TIME AND THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF GOAL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF SETTING A GOAL IT'S ABOUT THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT THEN IT'S ABOUT SETTING MILESTONES THAT ARE INTERMEDIATE TO THAT GOAL THEN IT'S ABOUT ASSESSING WHEATHER NOT YOUR REACHING THOSE MILESTONES AND THEN IT'S OF COURSE ABOUT UPDATING YOUR GOALS IF YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR GOALS ALL OF THAT IS AN ENORMOUSLY CONFUSING BATCH OF CHALLENGES IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ALL AT ONCE BUT IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN INTO THESE ELEMENTS THAT THE VISUAL SYSTEM CAN HELP YOU FIND AND MOVE TOWARDS THOSE MILESTONES I THINK THERE'S AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT AND THAT YOUR CONTROL OVER YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IS INDEED YOURS THAT YOU CAN DELIBERATELY SET IT TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND THEN YOU MAKE A PRACTICE OF STEPPING THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT STATIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS AGAIN I DO THIS EACH MORNING I DO THIS ONCE A DAY HOME RARELY HAVE I DONE IT TWICE A DAY RARELY HAVE I MISSE TA DAY BUT BY DOING THAT YOU CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN TEACHING THE SYSTEMS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE RELATED TO GOAL SETTING OFR REWARD TO MAP TO DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES SO IE FOUND THIS TO BE A VERY EFFECTIVE PROTOCAL THE BALSETTUS WORK HAS MAINLY FOCUSED ON VISUAL TOOLS THAT ARE OF A SINGLE HORIZON HEREON TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE WHAT I CALL STATIONS OR HORIZONS BUT WHAT'S VERY CLEAR IS THAT AN ABILITY TO MOVE FROM DIFFERENT VISUAL STATIONS AND TO DO THAT IN IT DELIBERATE WAY IN A FOCUSSED AND CONSCIOUS WAY CLEARLY MAPS TO AN ABILITY TO CONCEIVE OF DIFFERENT GOALS OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME AND I DO BELIEVE CAN BE GREATLY BENEFICIAL IN ALLOWING ONE TO SET PARTICULAR GOALS AND THEN MOVE THROUGH THE MILESTONES TO THOSE GOALS AND TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE ONES PURSUIT AND REWARD IN REACHING THOSE MILESTONES AND EVENTUALLY THE OVER ALL GOAL PER USUAL COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL TO DAY WE TALKED ABOUT SOMEOF THE NERROW SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY AND POPULAR UNDERSTANDING OF GOAL SEEKING BEHAVIOR HOW TO ASSESS GOALS ET CETERA ICH ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF EMILY BALSETTUS AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AND TE HER WORK ON THE USE OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM TO BETTER ACHIEVE GOALS AND INDEED THINGS LIKE VISUALIZATION AND WHY FORECASTING FAILURE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FORECASTING SUCCESS AS CONTER INTUITIVEIS THAT MIGHT SEEM OUTS WITH THE DATA POINT TO AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SETTING CONCRETE PLANS AND REALLY WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHAT INTERVALS AT WHICH TO ASSESS PROGRESS AND WHAT INTERVALS AT WHICH TO ASSESS REWARD AND HOW THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM IS INVOLLF AND IN ADDITION I DESCRIBE TO THIS PRACTICE THAT ONE CAN INCORPORATE AS A DAILY OR SEMI DAILY PRACTISE OF SO CALLED SPACETIME BRIDGING OF USING THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND YOURE ABILITY TO DELIBERATELY STEP YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM FROM STATIONS THAT ARE WITHIN YOUR BODIES SO CALL PERY PERSONAL OR INTERACEPTIVE SPACE OUT INTO THE WORLD FURTHER AND FURTHER AND THAN BACK AGAIN IN SEQUENTS AS A WAY TO HARNESS AND CULTIVATE AND BUILD UP THESE SYSTEMS THAT LINK VISION SPACE TIME REWARD SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH ULTIMATELY AS YOU SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS THERE ARE GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF BASIC STEPS THAT EVERYONE WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW YOU HAVE TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY WHAT THE LONG ARCHING ULTIMATE GOAL IS YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE MILESTONES WILL BE YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ALL OF THEM AT THE OUTSET BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SOME IDEA ABOUT THE INTERVALS AT WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO SET THOSE MILESTONES AND SET YOUR REWARD SCHEDUAL FOR ASSESSING PROGRESS IN TO THOSE MILESTONES IN YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL MY HOPE IS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THESE TOOLS IF NOT ALL OF THEM PERHAPS JUST ONE OF THEM OR TWO OF THEM IN PURSUIT OF WHATEVER PARTICULAR GOALS YOU HAPPEN TO BE FOCASTONE AT THIS POINT AND IN THE FUTURE IF YOUR ENJOYING AND OR

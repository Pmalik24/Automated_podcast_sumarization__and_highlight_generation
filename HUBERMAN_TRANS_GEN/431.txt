WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAPONPENCE A SCIENTS SCIENC SPACE TO S FOR    I MAY DRUHUBERMEN AND AM A PROFESSOR OF NOUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING SUPPLEMENTS WER MORE SPECIFICALLY A RATIONAL GUIDE TO SUPPLEMENTATION NOW TO BE FORTHRIGHT I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT A FAN OF THE WORD SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE IT STEMS FROM THIS IDEA THAT ALL SUPPLEMENTS ARE SOMEHOW FOOD SUPPLEMENTS OR DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE FOR WHAT ONE COULD OTHERWISE GET FROM FOOD AND THAT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE MANY SUPPLEMENTS ARE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE EXTREMELY EFFICACIOUS FOR INSTANCE FOR ENHANCING SLEEP OR FOR ENHANCING HORMON FUNCTION OR FOR ENHANCING FOCUS AND MANY OF THOSE COMPOUNDS ARE SIMPLY NOT FOUND IN FOOD OR ARE NOT FOUND IN ENOUGH ABUNDANCE IN FOOD TO HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT NOW THAT RAISES THE ISSUE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THESE COMPOUNDS ARE GOOD TO TAKE SAFE TO TAKE AND WHETHR OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR US AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE SUPPLEMENTS CAN EITHER BE GOOD FOR US OR DANGEROUS FOR US DEPENDING ON DOSAGE SORCING ET CETERA BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND A RATIONAL GUIDE TO SUPPLEMENTATION AS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS AND WE NEED TO SET ASIDE TDHE IDEA THAT ALL NON PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS THAT FALL UNDER THIS UMBRELA TERM SUPPLEMENTS ARE SIMPLY THINGS THAT COULD BE EXTRACTED FROM FOOD BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T EITHER IN JUST ENOUGH FOR THOSE FOODS OR PAY A NUT F ATTENTION TO THEIR DIET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THEM IN FACT DURING TO DAYS EPISODE I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN ANSWER IN ORDER TO DECIDE WHETHEROR NOT YOU SHOULD BE TAKING ANY SO CALLED SUPPLEMENTS OR NOT AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD BE TAKING ONE TYPE OF SUPPLEMENT OR ANOTHER TYPE OF SUPPLEMENT MORE OR LESS THAN THE OTHER IAM ALSO GOING TO DISCUSS SAFETY OF COURSE AND I WILL DISCUSS COST BECAUSE OBVIOUSLE MONITARY COST IS A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR MOST IF NOT EVERYBODY CONSIDERING THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTS DURING TO DAYS EPISODE I WILL ALSO DISCUSS WHICH SPECIFIC SUPPLEMENTS ARE OPPLEMAL FOR ACHIEVING SPECIFIC END POINTS SUCH AS IMPROVE SLEEP SUCH AS IMPROVED FOCUS AND SUCH AS IMPROVED HORMON FUNCTION AMONG OTHER THINGS I PLAN TO COVER THE FULL RANGE OF WHAT ARE REFERRED TO IS SUPPLEMENTS INCLUDING SO CALLED FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGN TO ACT AS A SORT OF INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT MIGHT EXIST WITHIN YOUR DIET ALL THE WAY UP TO VERY TARGETED OUTCOME SUPPLEMENTSING COMPOUNDS THAT IS COMPOUNDS THAT ARE NON PRESCRIPTION THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE VERY SPECIFIC AND POINTS SUCH AS ENHANCED FOCUS OVER THE NEXT FOR TO SIX HOURS OF PHYSICAL WORK OR MENTAL WORK SO ON AND SO FORTH AND TO COVER EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN THAT AS WELL AND I PROMISE TO COVER HOW SUPPLEMENTS INTERACT WITH OTHER THINGS SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL TOOLS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHEN SUPPLEMENTS MIGHT BE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHEN SUPPLEMENTS CAN SERVE AS AN AUGMENT TO ALREADY EXCELLENT NUTRICION AND PRESCRIPT ION PROTOCALS AND EVERY FEATURE OF SUPPLEMENTS AS IT RELATES TO MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU SHOULD BE ARMED WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AS THEY MENTION BEFOR THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DEVELOP THE MOST BIOLOGICALLY EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENT REGIMENT FOR YOU AND OF COURSE I WANT TOING KNOWLEDGE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OR DOSAGES OF A GIVEN SUPPLEMENT OR SUPPLEMENTS THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO TAKE COULD BE ZERO THERE ARE SUCH INDIVIDUALS BUT THAT MANY PEOPLE CANINFACT ARRIVE TREMENOUS BENEFIT FROM SUPPLEMENTS IN A WAY THAT CAN BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN TRYING TO OBTAIN THE SAME NON PRESCRIPTION NUTRIENTS FROM FOOD AS WEHEAD INTO TODAY'S CONVERSATION I WANT TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT NOT JUST AS IT RELATES TO SUPPLEMENTS BUT AS IT RELATES TO ALL ASPECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE AND THAT IS I TAKE THE STANCS THAT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THAT IS SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE AND SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT WE AVOID FORM THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE SO THINGS LIKE VIEWING MORNING SUNLIGHT AND EXERCISE ARE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THEY DON'T REQUIRE THE INGESTION OF ANYTHING WITHIN THE REALM OF BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THERE ARE ALSO SOME DONTS OR DO NOTS THAT CAN GREATLY ENHANTS OUR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE SUCH AS AVOIDING BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FORIM OR AVOIDING CAFFINE TOO LATE IN THE AFTERNOON BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU CAN AFFALL A SLEEP AFTER INJESTING CAFINE AN THE LATE AFTERNOON WE KNOW IT DISRUPTS THE ARCHITECTURE OF YOUR SLEEP IN WAYS THAT GREATLY DIMINISH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PE FORMANCE THL FOLLOWING DAY FORM INSTANCE SO BEHAVIORAL TOOLS FORM THE FOUNDATIONAL LAYER OF ALL TOOLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE SECOND TO THAT I WOULD SAY THE NEXT LAYER IS IN FACT NUTRITION NO AMOUNT OF SUPPLEMENTATION OR NON PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS OR PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS FOR THAT MATTER CANNEVER COMPENSATE FOR POOR NUTRITION AT LEAST NOT FOR VERY LONG GI SO THIS IS A KEY POINT EVEN THOUGH MANY SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT SIMPLY FOOD SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE FOR ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD OTHERWISE GET FROM FOOD THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT YOU CAN LIVE ON SUPPLEMENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU COULD LIVE ON WAV PROTENE AND FISH OIL A CAPSOLS AND VITEMIN CAP SOOLS OR TABLETS FOR A SHORT WHILE BUT BEFORE LONG YOUD EITHER ON SUPFFER FROM BORDUM A TO THE AXENTHY DO ANT TO GO BACK TO FOOD OR SOME OTHER DEFICIENCY WOULD SHOW UP I THINK IT'S THE RARE INDIVIDUAL THAT TRAES O SURRIVE ENTIRELY ON FOOD SUPPLEMENTS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT MOST EVERYBODY AND I WOULD HOPE EVERYBODY IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THEIR NUTRITION SO I WOULD PLACE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS DUS AND DO KNOTS AS LAYER ONE THE DEEPEST LAYER THE BED ROCK OF ALL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AN PERFORMANCE ON TOP OF THAT I WOULD PLACE NUTRITION AND OF COURSE THAT'S GOING TO MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A HUGE ARRAY OF DIFFERENT FOOD CHOICES AND NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMS NUTRITION IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT FOR MACRONUTRIENTS FOR STORAGE OF ENERGY IN THE FORM OF GLICAGIN FATS AND PHOSORCRETIN STORES AND SO FORTH BUT ALSO FOR OBTAINING BASIC NEUTRIANS VIDEMENS MINERALS AND MICHRO NUTRANCE ICAS SO WE'VE GOT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NUTRITIONAL TOOLS THEN ON TOP OF THAT I WOULD PLACE WHAT IS TYPICALLY CALLED SUPPLEMENTATION ALTHOUGH TO DAY I'M TRYING TO EXPAND THAT WORD TO INCLUDE NOTJIOUS THINGS AT COMPENSATE FOR FOOD DEFICIENCIES OR THAT ARE LAYERED ON TOP OF FOOD AS A WAY TO ENHANCE THE MOUNT OF NUTRIANS THAT YOU COULD GET FROM FOOD BUT AS I MENTION BEFORE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE NON PRESCRIPTION THAT CAN BE FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND MANY OF WHICH ARE NOT AVAILABLENE FOOD SO I WOU PLACE SUPPLEMENTATION WRITE ON TOP OF NUTRITION THEN PASS THAT I WOULD SA PRESRIPTION DRUGS OBVIOUSLY PRESCRIBED FROM A BOARD CERTIFIED MDY CAN SERVE OF VERY VITAL PURPOSE IN THE TREATMENT OR AUGMENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE COL SO SOME PEOPLE DO IN FACT NEED PRESCRIPTION ANTATO PRESSENCE OTHER PEOPLE DO NOT SOME PEOPLE DO IN FACT NEED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR ATTENTION DEPHISAT HYPORACTIVITY DISORDER OR SLEEP RELATE DISORDERS SO ON AND SO FORTH THE WHOLE ISSO OF WEATHER NOT THERE IS IN OVER PRESCRIPTION EPIDEMIC OR NOT OM IS A SEPARATE CONVERSATION FOR A SEPARATE PODCASTS I WOULD ARGUE THAT MANY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DO IN FACT SAVE LIVES THIS INCLUDES THE CATEGORY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO STATINS AND CARDIVASCULAR HEALTH RELATED TO ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS EVEN SLEEP DISORDERS AND INSOMNIAND ARCHALEPSY AND SO FORTH THAT SAID THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN EITHER REDUCE THEIR DOSAGEES OF PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS OR CAN REPLACE THOSE PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS WITH QUALITY BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION BUT THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE THE ONLY ROUTE BY WHICH PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THE MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE COLS THAT THEY WISH TO ACHIEVE SO I WOULD PLACE THAT AS THE FOURTH LAYER IN THE STACK OF LAYERS DIRECTED TOWARDS MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE SO JUST TO LIST OFF AGAIN I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT BEHAVIORS DUES AND DO NOT FORM THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH PERFORMANCE NEXT IN LINE WOULD BE NUTRITION THAT IS THE SPECIFIC FOODS WE EAT THE AMOUNT THAT WE EAT THE COMMINATIONS OF FOODS THAT WE EAT IN A GIVEN SITTING AND THE TIMING IN WHICH WE EAT OUR FOOD THEN ON TOP OF THAT I WOULD PLACE SUPPLEMENTATION THE TOPIC OF TO DAY'S EPISODE AND FINALLY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS S IN OF COURSE ALL OF THESE THINGS INTERRACT IN IMPORTANT IN AND INTERESTING WAYS MANY OF WHICH INTERACTIONS WE WILL ISCUSS DURING TO DAY'S PODCAST AS WE DRILL INTO THE TOPIC OF SUPPLEMENTATION DEVELOPING A RATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCALL AND ONE THAT IS MOST BIOLOGICALLY AND COUST EFFECTIVE BEFORE MOVING FURTHER INTO TO DAY'S EPISODE I WANT TO EMPHISIZE AT VERY IM PORTANT POINT WHICH IS THAT I AM NOT A PHYSICION THAT IS I'M NOT A CLINITION SO I DO NOT PRESCRIBE ANYTHING NOR AM I GOING TO DO THAT TODAY I'M A PROFESSOR I REVIEW THE RESEARCH LITERATURE I DESCRIBE TOOLS GLEANED FROM THE RESEPT LITERATURE AND DEVELOPED FROM THE RESEARCH LITERATURE SO I PROFESS MANY THINGS BUT I DO NOT PRESCRIBE ANYTHING IN I THINK ITS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT ANY TIME YOU ARE THINKING OF ADDING OR SUBTRACTING ANY BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALLS NEUTRITIONAL PROTOCALLS SUPPLEMENTATION BASE PROTOCALLS AND CERTAINLY PRESCRIPTION DRUG BASE PROTOCALLS FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE THAT YOU CONSULT A TRUSTED BORD CERTOFIED PHYSICION THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL I DON'T SAY THAT MERELY TO PROTECT ME I MAINLY SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF TO DAY'S EPISODE IS NOT GOING TO BE THAT YOU DISCOVER ONE PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENTS OR CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTS OR BLEND OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT IS GOING TO TRANSFORM YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE NO THE PURPOSE OF TO DAY'S EPISODE IS FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU HAVE NEEDS THAT CAN BE MET BY SUPPLEMENTATION BETTER THAN ANY OTHER APPROACH AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW TO THINK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION THAT IS HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND HOW THOSE INTERACT WITH YOUR NUTRITION AND YOUR BEHAVIORS SO THAT YOU CAN MAXIMISE YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS THAT WE HAVE THIS WORD SUPPLEMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTATION BUT THAT MEANS MANY MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IT MEANS VITEMENS IT MEEANS MINERALS IT MEANS ADAPTGENS MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DONLY MANOW WHAT AN ADAPTAGIN REALLY IS AND IN FACT MANY PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT ADAPTAGENS NEVER ACTUALLY DEFINE WHAT AN ADAPTAGIN IS OR TS DESIGN FOR OR THE FACT THAT MANY ADAPTAGENS ARE ALSO USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS REALLY ABOUT YOU LEARNING HOW TO THINK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD LEARN TO THINK ABOUT NUTRITION OR EXERCISE OR ANYTHING RELATED TO BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH FOR THAT MATTER IN A WAY THAT LETS YOU NAVIGATE THIS VAST SPACE THAT WE CALL SUPPLEMENTATION AND DEVELOP PROTOCALLS THAT ARE OPTIMUL FOR YOU AND INDEED IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT THE IDEAL DOSAGE OF A GIVEN SUPPLEMENT FOR YOU IS ZERO MILIGRAMS FOR INSTANCE IF I ASK YOU ARE YOU SLEEPING DEEPLY AND ENOUGH EACH NIGHT DO YOU FEEL RESTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY MAY BE NEED A SHORT NAP AND THAT'S IT OR MAY BEYOU DON'T AND YOU SAY YES I FEEL GREAT I SLEEP GREAT I WAKE UP FEELING GREAT I ONLY NEED A SHORT NAP OR NO NAP DURING THE DAY TO FEEL RESTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY WELL THEN THERE'S REALLY NO DISCUSSION ABOUT SLEEP SUPPLEMENTATION TO BE HAD BETWEEN YOU AND ME HOWEVER IF YOU ARE NOT SLEEPING WELL THEN A BIG DISCUSSION OPENS UP AS TO WHAT THE REASONS ARE AS IT RELATE TO NUTRITION OR WHEN YOUR EXERCISING OUR INJESTING CAFFINE IN OTHER WORDS NO DISCUSSION ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION CAN BE HAD IN AVACUUM RATHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN A LARGER CONTECT SO TODAY YOU CAN A LEARN HOW TO PLACE THE DISCUSSION AND THIN KING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION IN A LARGER CONTEXT ANYTHING ABOUT HOW SPECIFIC SUPPLEMENT THAT IS SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS AND COMMENATIONS OF INGREDIENTS CAN INDEED BE USED TO BUFFER AND SUPPORT YOUR OVER ALL HEALTH END LEAD YOU TO SPECIFIC HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE T EMPHASISE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSERS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE SELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCES ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TELECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDR MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THATS DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTATION AND HOW TO DEVELOP A RATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY EMERGED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IS THAT SUPPLEMENTS AND THERE I'M REFERRING TO NON PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS DESIGN TO AUGMENT NUTRITION PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALS HAVE EMERGED AS A MAIN STAY WITHIN THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUT ALSO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FOCUSSED ON DEVELOPING MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE FOR THEIR PATIENTS AND THEIR ATHLETES AND FOR THE EVERYDAY PERSON ESPECIALLY WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO A DISCUSSION ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS WOULD MAINLY TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NECHE COMMUNITIES OF HEALTH FOOD STORES OR OF PARTICULAR ATHLETES BUT NOWADAYS I THINK ALMOST EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT YES INDEED THERE ARE STANDARD VIDEMEN SUPPLEMENTS BUT THAT THERE ARE ALSO SUPPLEMENTS SUCH AS VITEMEND THREE WHICH AURE DESIGND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF HORMONES IN THEIR BLOOD STREAM BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT BE GETTING ENOUGH SUNSHINE ALTHOUGH I'LL BE VERY CLEAR OVER AND OVER THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE THAT THERE IS NO PILL REPLACEMENT FOR SUNSHINE NOR IS THERE AE PILL REPLACEMENT OR FOOD REPLACEMENT FOR THAT MATTER FOR EXERCISE OR FOR SOCIAL CONNECTION OR FOR SLEEP OR FOR SIMPLY GETTING SMARTER AGAIN THERE IS NO PILL THAT'S GOING TO REPLACE EXCELLENT BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALS IN FACT A PHYSICIAN FRIEND OF MINE HAS A GREAT SAYING THAT I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD KEEP IN MIND AS WE WADE INTO THIS CONVERSATION WHICH IS THAT BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY STILL REQUIRES BETTER LIVING  I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PHRASE TO KEEP IN MINE WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE OPTUMAL SUPPLEMENTATION OR PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROTOCAL FOR YOU SO WHAT IS AN IDEAL SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCAL WELL I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND ASK WHAT ARE DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENTS DESIGNED TO DO FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS THESE ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNE TO ESTABLISH A FOUNDATION OR PROVIDE INSURANCE ALONG WITH YOUR NUTRITIONAL INTAKE TO INSURE THAT YOUR GETTING ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO HAVE A BASIC LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE NOW THIS IS THE ONE CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTS FOR WHICH I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE AND IN FACT ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE MULTIPLE INGREDIENTS IN A GIVEN SUPPLEMENT THROUGHOUT THE REST OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ADVANTAGE OF MAINLY FOCUSING ON TAKING SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS WHAT WERE MAINLY TALKING ABOUT ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CONTAIN VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES YOU MIGHT HAVE FROM DIET OR FROM LACK OF ADEQUATE DIET HOW WOULD SUCH A LACK OF VITEMEN AND MINERAL AND TAKE ARISE WELL FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR SOMEBODY THAT PRACTISES INTERMITTENT FASTING OR OTHER COMPONENTS OF FASTING OR FEUR SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT GET ENOUGH VITEMENTS AND MINERALS FROM VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND GRAINS AND MEATS WELL THEN TAKING A SUPPLEMENT THAT CAN ACT AS A INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST ANY VITEMEN  MINERAL DEFICIENCIES IN MANY WAYS CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS ALTHOUGH I WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE A SAFETY CONCERNS IN JUST A FEW MINUTES NOW I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS SOON AS WE TALK ABOUT VITENMEN MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS THE SCEPTICS IMMEDIATELY RAISE THEIR HANDS AND SAY ALL THAT VITEMEN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS DO IS GIVE YOU VERY EXPENSIVE URINE AND THERE THE SCEPTICS ARE REFERRING TO THE FACT THE REALITY THAT WHEN YOU INJEST HIGH LEVELS OF WATER SOLUBLE VITEMENT O THINK VITEMEN SEA AND SOME OF THE OTHER VITEMENS THAT INDEED YOU WILL EXCRETE THEM IN YOUR URINE HOWEVER IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH OF THE WATER SOLUBLE VITEMENTS FROM THEIR FOODS AND IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE AND IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT INJESTING HIGHER THAN NEEDED AMOUNTS OF MOST WATER SOLUBLE VOT VIEMENTS PROVIDED THOSE LEVELS AREN'T EXCEEDINGLY HIGH IS OR AT LEAST WE SHOULD SAY CAN BE SAFE AND AGAIN THIS IS PROVIDED THAT THE LEVELS THAT THEIR INJESTING ARE NOT EXCEEDINGLY HIGH SO THE TYPICAL VITEMAND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT IS INDEED GOING TO COVER ANY GAPS ARE DEFICIENCIES THAT MIGHT ARISE IN THE WATER SOLUBLE VITEMENS FROM YOUR FOOD AND TAKE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE GETTING ENOUGH OF THE WATER SOLUBLE VITEMENTS FROM THEIR FOOD IF THEY ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO A COUPLE OF THINGS AND THOSE THINGS ARE VERY SIMPLE TO LAY OUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT OUARE A VEGAN OF EGETARIAN A MORE TRADITIONAL OMNIVORE EATING FROM BOTH ANIMAL BASED AND PLANT BASE SOURCES GRAINS ET CETERA OR EVEN IF YOU ARE IN THE PURE CARNIVORE OR STRICT I GUESS IT'S CALL THE LIONDIETWORDS JUST MEAT AND SALT REGARDLESS OF WHAT TYPOF NUTRICION YOU FOLLOW YOU WILL GET VITEMENTS AN MINERALS BUT YOU'LL GET MORE OR FEWER OF THEM DEPENDING ON THE NUTRICIONAL PROGRAM YOU FOLLOW AND OF COURSE DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN AND HOW MUCH YOU EAT THAT'S A SORT OF OBVIOUS MOST PEOPLE WHO TAKE A VITEMIN MINERAL SUPPLEMENT WILL INDEED EXCRETE A LOT OF THE WATER SOLUBLE VITEMENS THEY WILL RETAIN THE FAT SOLUBLE VITEMENTS AND THERE AGAIN THE SCEPTICS WILL RAISE THEIR HANDS AND SAY YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE HIGH LEVELS OF FAT SOLUBLE VITEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE STORED IN YOUR SYSTEM POTENTIALLY TO LEVELS THAT ARE DANGEROUS AGAIN PROVIDED THAT VITEMIN MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT TAKING IN EXCESS IT'S UNLIKELY THAT YOUARE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A BUILD UP OF THE FAT SOLUBLE VITEMENTS IN YOUR SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE A PROBLEM SO THAT RAISES A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU NEED TASK DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A VITEMIN MINERAL SUPPLEMENT WELL THE ANSWER TO THAT WILL BE HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL BUT YOU REALLY JUST NEED TO ADDRESS TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL IS THE COST WITHIN THE RANGE THAT YOU CAN AFFORD AND WANT TO PAY OFTENTIMES THESE VITEMINMINERAL SUPPLEMENTS CAN BE QUITE INEXPENSIVE BUT SOME OF THEM CAN BE QUITE EXPENSIVE AND YOU CAN SEE THE FULL RANGE OF WONES THAT ARE PENNIES PER DAY ALL THE WAY UP TO MANY DOLLARS ARE TENS OF DOLLARS PER DAY BECAUSE OF WHAT ARE REPORTED TO BE VARIATIONS IN QUOLITY AN SOURCING AND SO FORTH I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY REAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF THE WATER SOLUBLE AND FAT SOLUBLE VITEMENS FOUND IN THE LESS EXPENSIVVERSES THE MORE EXPENSIVE VITEMIN MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS MORE TYPICALLY THE COST SCALES WITH THE DOSAGES OF THESE DIFFERENT VITEMENTS IN MINERALS AND AS BOULD PROBABLY BE EXPECTED THE MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN AND SOURCE VIEMENTS AND MINERALS TEND TO BE IN LOWER QUANTITIES IN THE LESS EXPENSIVE VERSIONTS OF VITEMIN MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS THAS THIS KIND OF OBVIOUS YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF CAN YOU AFFORD IT FINANCIALLY AND THEN YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF ARE YOU ABLE TO REGULARLY INJEST ENOUGH FOODS WITH ENOUGH VARIETY TO COVER YOUR VITEMIN MINERAL NEEDS JUST FROM FOOD AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE AN IMMEDIATE YES THEY ARE CAREFUL TO GET ENOUGH OF THE FOODS THAT ALLOW THEM TO OBTAIN THEIR VITEMEN AN MINERAL QUOTA AND FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS THE ANSWER WILL BE NO I WOULD SAY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE EXTREMELY PHYSICALLY AND OR MENTALLY ACTIVE AND FOR PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS ARE FALLOWING A INTERMITTAN FASTING SCHEDUAL SO THEY ARE NOT INJESTING A LOT OF FOOD IN GENERAL OR RESTRICTING THEIR FOOD INTAKE TO SPECIFIC TIMES OF DAY WILL THEN A VITEMINMINERAL SUPPLEMENT LIKELY MAKE SENSE FOR THEM HOWEVER IT'S GOING O BE VERY IMPORTANT TO INJEST THAT VITEMIN MINERAL SUPPLEMENT WITH FOOD AND IDEALLY EARLY IN THE DAY SO THAT CAN SET UP A LOBIT OF A CHALENGE FOR THE INTERMITTAN FASTERS WHO ARE RESTRICTIN TEIR FEEDING WINDOW TO LATE IN THE DAY WHY DO I SAY THIS WILL MANY OF THE WATER SOLUBLE VITEMENTS IN PARTICULAR THE BEE VITEMENS NEED TO BE INJESTED WITH FOOD BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY CAN CAUSE SOME STOMACH UPSET AND AGAIN THERE'S ARRANGE THER ARE SOME PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF CAN TAKE BE VITEMENTS ON AN EMPTY STOMAC AN FEEL FINE OTHER PEOPLE FEEL REALLY LOWSY WHEN THEY TAKE BE VITEMENS THERE RE FEW OTHER THINGS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT LATER I'M NAMELY ZINC AND COINS IM CUTEN THAT REALLY SHOULD ALSO BE TAKEN WITH FOOD BUT THE BEST TIME TO TAKE A VITEM IN MINERAL SUPPLEMENT IS WITH FOOD AND I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE A VITEMAN MINERAL SUPPLEMENT THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE IT WITH FOOD AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE DOSAGES OF VITEMENTS AND MINERALS FROM SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEEDINGLY HIGH FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE IS THE BUILD UP OF FAT SOLIBLE VITEMENTSTHAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE OTHER REASON IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE TEND TO TAKE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF VITEMENS AND MINERALS FROM SUPPLEMENTS THEY TEND TO SPEND LESS TIME AND FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT THEIR OPTIMIZING THEIR NUTRITION OR AT LEAST TRYING TO GET THEIR NUTRITION RIGHT WHAT DO I MEAN BY GETTING THEIR NUTRITION RIGHT WELL I THINK REGARDLESS OF WEATHER NOT YOURE KEYTO OMNIVOR CARNIVORE VEGEN OR ANY OTHER NUTRITIONAL PLAN THE KEY THING IS TO GET MOST THAT IS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY PER CENT OF YOUR FOODS OR MORE FROM NON PROCESS OR MENIMOLY PROCESS SOURCES I THINK THERE IS AGREEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD THAT MOST PEOPLE SHOULD AVOID HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS HILY PROCES FOODS ARE GIG TO BE FOODS WITH VERY LONG INGREDIENT LISTS THAT HAVE VERY LONG SHELF LIVES SO THIS OFTEN INCLUDES SNACK FOODS IT DOES INCLUDE SNACK FOODS LIKE SHIPS ET CETERA PASTRIES THAT CONSID ON THE SHELF ALONG TIME BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE CANSOUPS AN NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OTHER FOODS THAT HAVE MANY MANY INGREDIENTS PRESERVATIVES MOST PEOPLE WOULD DO WELL TO AVOID THOSE KINDS OF FOODS AND FOCUS MOST OF TEIR INTAKE ON THINGS THAT ARE NON PROCESS OF THESE WOULD BE THINGS LIKE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES YOU KNOWS THAT THE NON PROCESS FOODS WILL TEND TO HAVE VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE OR REQUIRE REFRIDURATION AN SOME CASES SUCH AS MEAT EGGS ET CETERA OR MINIMILY PROCESS FOODS SUCH AS ONT RICE AND OBIALS AND PROCES BEANS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BEANS OFTENTIMES CAN BE COMPLETELY ON PROCESSES WELL OF COURSE THIS IS TOO GENERAL CATEGORIES UNPROCESS AND MINLMY PROCESS THAT SHOULD MAKE UP ABOUT EIGTY PER CENT OR MORE OF YOUR FOOD IN TAKE IFOUR GOAL IS HEALTH AN OBTAINING ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF VITEMENS ANDMINERALS THE SOLL ALL FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS INCLUDE OF COURSE VITEMEN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS BUT HAS EXPANDED OVER THE LAST DECATE OR MORE TO ALSO INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTS THAT HAVE VITEMENS AND MINERALS BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE DIGESTIVE ENZIMES AND AGAIN HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE WHERE INDEED YOU CAN GET DIGESTIVE ENZIMES FROM FOODS FOR INSTANCE EATING A BIT OF PAPIA OR EVEN A A BIT OF PINE APPLE CAN ASSIST IN THE DIGESTION OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF MACRINUTIANS BECAUSE THESE ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING ENZIMES THAT HELP DIGEST THINGS LIKE CARBOHYDRATES FATS AND PROTINES AND THERE ARE OTHER FOOD BASE SOURCES OF ENZIMES YOURE WELCOME TO LOK THOSE UP ON LINE IF FJUST PUT FOOD BASE SOURCES OF ENZIMES AND OU'LL FIND THOSE BUT NOWADAY S A LOT OF THE FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS WILL INCLOD PAP PAN OR THEY WILLINCLUDE DIFFERENT WLI PASES OR ANY TIME YOU HER THE WORD ASTES BY THE WAY T MEANS A AT ENZIN MANANZIM DESIGN TO BREAK DOWN OR TO CATALI SOME SORT OF REACTION  MIOLOGY AND A NUTRITION IN PARTICULAR SO YOU CAN FINDS FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT INCLUDE VITEMENS AND MINERALS AND DIGESTIVE ENZIMES AND NOWADAYS MORE AND MORE THE QUALITY FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS ARE ALSO INCLUDING THINGS LIKE ADAPTAGENS AND HERE THE NAME ADAPTAGENS ITHE SORT OF VAGUE AND IT INDEED HAS NO SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL DEFINITION THIS IS SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION IS THAT COMPANIES AND INDEED PODCASTS CAN TALK ABOUT ADAPTAGENS WITHOUT ACTUALLY DEFINING WHAT IN ADAPTAGON IS IN AN OPERATIONAL WAY WHEN WE SAY OPERATIONAL WHAT WE MEAN IS ADEFINITION THAT EVERY ONE IN A GIVEN ARENA OR SPACE RESEARCH FOR INSTANCE CAN AGREE ON SO THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ADAPTAGENIC EFFECTS OF A GIVEN COMPOUND WHERE LL TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THINGS WELL FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS NOWADAYS INCLUDE VITEMENTS MINERALS DIGESTIVE ENZIMES AND THE SO CALL THA DAPTAGENS AND THE ADAPTAGENS BROADLY SPEAKING ARE THOUGHT TO IMPROVE THE BODY IN BRAINS OF BILL ABILITY TO BUFFER AGAINST VARIOUS STRESSERS SO THESE CAN BE THINGS LIKE HERBS LIKE ASHUOGONDA THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE CORTESALL LEVELS AND THAT SENSE ASHOGONDA IS IN ADAPTAGEN BUT ASHROGONDA HAS OTHER EFFECTS RELATED TO HORMONAUGMENTATION IN BOTH THE TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND MAY BEVEN THE THIEROD PATHAS WILL TALK ABOUT THE SOLIBIT LATER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS FOR HORMON AUGMENTATION SO FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS HAS REALLY EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A LOT OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF NUTRIENTS AND MICRONUTRIANS VITEMENS AND MINERALS DIGESTIVE ENZIN DESIN TO ACHIEVE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF A FACTS AGAIN THIS IS THE ONE CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTATION WHERE I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO EXPLORE MOULTY INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S OFTEN INCLUDED IN THESE SO CALED FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS OR PROBIATICS OR PREBIOTICS WHICH ARE DESIGN TO AGMENT AND SUPPORT THE SO CALL GOT MICROBIUM THE GOT MICROBIUM IS THE COLLECTION OF TRILIANS OF LITTLE MICROBACTERIA THAT EXIST IN ALL OF US THEY MAINLY EXIST IN THE MUCUS MEMBRANE LINED TISSUES OF THE BODY SO THAT WOULD BE OUR NASAL PASSAGES YOUR MOUTH THE VIGINA THE EURETHRA AND THE GOT THE WHOLE WAY FROM YOUR MOUTH ALL THE WAY OUT THE OTHER END SO NOCIOUS YOUR STOMACH TRILIANS OF BACTERIA LIVE THERE TRILIANS OF MICROBACTERIA ALSO LIVE ON YOUR SKIN IN FACT EVERY TIME YOU SHAKE SO ONE'S HAND YOURE EXCHANGING MICROBACTERIA THESE MICROBACTERIA OFTEN ARE HEALTHY FOR US GOOD FOR US THEY SUPPORT A HUGE NUMBER OF POSITIVE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS BUT THERE ARE OTHER MICROBACTERIA THAT LIVE IN OUR GUT AND ELSEWHERE ON THOSE MUCUSLINE TISSUES THAT CAN BE DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR US THAT CAN HARM OUR HEALTH AGROWING IDEA O THESE DAYS BASED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LABORATORIES WORK INCLUDING THE LABORATORY OF MY UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR AT STAMFORD DOCTOR JUSTIN SONUMBERG WHO'SE BEEN AGEST ON THIS PODCAST IS THAT HAVING A GREAT DIVERSITY A RANGE OF MICROBIODA AT THE AS THEYR CALLED MICRO BIOM MICROBIODA AND THESE MICROBACTERIA ARE ALL SENTURY REFERRING TO THE SAME THING THE MICROBUM AS THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF THESE MICROBACTERIA BUT HAVING A LOT OF DIFFERENT  SO CALLED SPECIES OF THESE MICROBACTERIA IS KNOWN TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION HORMONE FUNCTION IT SUPPORTS THE SO CALLED GOT BRAIN ACIS THAT'S IM PORTANT FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING MOOD AND MOTIVATION ACTUALY SUPPORTS THUPPRODUCTION OF NUR TRANSMITTERS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT CAN HELP TO BE MOTIVATED ELEVATED MOOD SUPPORT THE GENERAL FUNCTION OF NERONS WELL NOT SUPPRISINGLY THERE ARE WAYS TO SUPPORT THE GOT MICROBIOM IN THEIR WAYS TO HARM THE GOT MICROBIAMO REFERRED TO THE PODCAST EPISODE WE DID WITH JUST IN SONOBERG CON FIND THAT IT HUBERMAN LABDOCOM IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ALL THE DIFFENT WAYS YOU CAN SUPPORT YOUR GOT MICROBIOM BUT FORSAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION I WANT EMPHASIZED THAT SOME OF THOSE METHODS OF SUPPORTING THE GOT MICROBIOM ARE THROUG THE DIRECT CONSUNCTION OF PARTICULAR FOODS AND THEIR TWO CATEGORIES OF FOODS THAT IF YOURE GETTING ENOUGH OF THEM IT'S LIKELY THAT YOU'RE GOT MICROBIOM IS DIVERSE AND IS GOING TO SUPPORT ALL THOSE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS I JUST LISTED OFF AND OTHER FUNCTIONS AS WELL THE TWO SORCES OF GOT MI GOBIODA SUPPORTING FOODS ARE LOW SUGAR FERMENTED FOOD SO THESE WOULD BE THINGS LIKE SOUR CAU KIMCHI A GRGREEKYOGAR AGAIN LOW SUGAR GREKYOGAR OM COMBOUCHA IN PARTICULAR AS A DRINK A THINGS LIKE KEEFER THERE ARE BUNCH OF OTHER VARIETIES OF FORMENTED FOODS DIFFERENT CULTURES AT DIFFERENT FERMENTED FOOD SO JAPANESE NOTO IS A ANOTHER SOURCE OF OF FERMENT THAT IS VERY GOOD FOR THE GOMICROBIOM AND WORK FROM JUST IN SONENBERG LAB AND CLOSE BY LABS AT STAMPHRED SCHOOL MEDICINE HAVE SHOWN THAT IF PEOPLE IN JEST FOR SERVINGS TO DAY OF THESE LOW SUGAR FRMENTED FOODS IT GREATLY IMPROVES THE FUNCTION OF THE GOTMICROBIOM AND IN PARTICULAR ENHANCES THE FUNCTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND IT REDUCES THE SO CALLED IN FLAMATOME IT REDUCES INFLAMMATION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY IN THE WAYS THAT ARE HELPFUL AND EFFECTIVE FOR BRAIN AND BODY THAT IS MENTAL HEALF PHYSICAL HEATH IN PERFORMANCE SO THERE ARE WAYS TO SUPPORT YOUR GOTMICROBIOM STRICTLY FROM FOOD BUT ICHICOME HAS NO SUPPRISE THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT INJESTING FOR SERVING TO DAY OF FERMENTED FOODS HOPFULLY THE'RE GETTING EN OG FIBR ESPECIALLY PREBIOTIC FIBR WHICH IS ONE OTHER WAY TO SUPPORT THE GOT MICROBIOM ALTHOUGH THE STUDIES FROM JUST IN SONONBERG S LAB POINT TO THE FACT THAT FIBR IN TAKE ITSELF WAS NOT DIRECTLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GTMICROBIOM IN EVERYBODY IT WAS IN SOME INDIVIDUALS BUT NOT IN OTHERS IN SOME HAD NO EFFECT AND IN OTHER INDIVIDUALS IT ACTUALLY MADE THE CATEGORY OR I SHOULD SAY THE  A RAY OF INFLAMATOME MARKERS WORSE IT ACTUALLY LED TO MORE INFLAMMATION SO THAT S NOT TO SAY THAT FIBRS BAD IN FACT IN THE EPISODE THAT WE DID WITH DOCTRO LANE NORTON HE DISCUSSD THE MANY BENEFITS OF G TING ENA FIBRE THERE ARE LOTTER REASONS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD GET ENOUGH FIBRE IN THEIR DIET BUT AT LEAST FOR SUPPORTING THE GOT MICROBIOM FOR SERVINGS TO DAY OF LOST SUGAR FORMENTED FOODS SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THE GOT MICROBIUM THROUGH THE INTAKE OF NUTRITION AGAIN MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT ACHIEVING THAT AND THEREFORE THESE FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN BE JUST VIDEMENMEN MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS OR COLD BE VITEMENAN MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS PLUS DIGESTIVE ENZIMES OR BOTH OF THOSE THINGS PLUS ADAPTIGENS NOW ALSO TEND TO INCLUDE PREBIOTICS AND PROBIOICS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE PROLIFERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF ENOUGH GOT MICROBIODA IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE GOT MICROBIOM AND THE GOT BRAIN AXIS NOW BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GOT MICROBIUMAN BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR THE GOT MICROBIUM IN THE FORM OF LOW SUGAR FORMENTED FOODS AND PREBIOTIC FIBRE FROM THEIR DIET I THINK PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHEATHER NOT IT INCLUDES VITEMENS AND MINERALS ADAPTAGINS IND DIGESTIVE ENZIMES IS SOME WAY TO SUPPORT THE GOT MICROBIOM NOW THIS GETS INTO A WHOLE DIMENSION OF OF CATEGORIES OF PREBOTIC AND PROBIOTIC CAPSULS AND ONE NEEDS TO BE VERY CAREFUL THERE I DO ONE TO SAY THAT MOST OF THE PRBOTIC AND PROBIOTIC CAPSULS THAT YOU CAN BUY FOR SOFALL ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THE BEST ONES ARE GOING TO BE REFRIGERATER TO REQUIRE REFRIGERATION JUST AS DO ANY GOOD LOW SUGAR FORMENTED FOODS BY THE WAY SO FOR INSTANCE PICKLES ARE A LOW SUGAR FORMENTED FOOD THAT CAN SUPPORT THE GOT MICROBIUM BUT IF YOUR BUYING PICKLES FROM THE SECTION AND OF THE GROCERY STOREWHERE THEY THE PICKLES ARE NOT REFRIGERATED WELL THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE GOT MICROBIUM SUPPORTING EFFECTS FROM THOSE PICKLES SOR FUNNY OR EVEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION TUCKING UP PICKLES BUT THE REALITY AS THEY CAN GREATLY ENHANCE THE MICROBIOTA IF YOU ARE GETTING PICKLES THAT ARE AND REQUIRE REFRIGERATION AND INCLUDE THE BRINE WHICH IS THE THE LIQUID AROUM THEM THE SAME IS TRUE FOR SOURCROT NONROFRAGERADE SOUERCRUT IS NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR GOTMICROBIUM IT WILL SUPPLY SOME OTHER THINGS PERHAPS BUT IS NOT ON SUPPORT YOUR GO MICROBIMENT HAS TO BE THE REFRIGERATE DIVERSIONS FOR THE REASON THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH FOOD BASED SUPPORT FOR THE GOT MICROBIUM AND BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GOT MICROBUM ONE OF THE KEY CATEGORIES OF FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CREATE SUPPORT FOR THE MICROBIUM THROUGH PREBIOTICS OR PROBOTICS AGAIN THEY TEND TO BE THE REFRIGERATED VARIETIES OF THE ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK THOSE ALSO TEN TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND THERE ARE SOME EVIDENCE THAT TAKING EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF PREBIOTICS AND PROBIOTICS THAT IS TYPICAL OF THESE CAPSAL FORMS OF PREBOTICS AND PROBIOTICS IF THEY'RE TAKEN ON GOING NOT FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME BUT IF THEYRE TAKEN ON GOING CAN LEAD TO SOME ISSUES LIKE BRAIN FALG THERE IS A NICE LITERATURE ON THIS THAT AND A GROWING ONE AT THAT SO MY SUGGESTION IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TAKE SUPPLEMENTS TO SUPPORT THE MI CROBIOM THAT THOSE SUPPLEMENTS INCLUDE LOW ENOUGH LEVELS THAT IS SMALL ENOUGH AMOUNTS OF PREBOTICS AND PROBOTICS THAT YOU DON'T START TO VENTURE INTO THE REALM OF BRAIN PHOG AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT COAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH TAKING TOO MUCH PREBOTIC AND PROBIOTIC IN THE FORM OF SUPPLEMENTS I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL F YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLTIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOD IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTIS AN ATHLETIC GRENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTAGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE GRIPE IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN SDOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEYL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIND THAT THATHLETIC GREEN DOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THRE KA TO THE OTHER CATEGORY FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS ARE THOSE ADAPTAGENS THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER ADAPTIGENS AGAIN BEING A VERY POORLY DEFINE CATEGORY BUT THESE ARE TYPICALLY MICRO NUTRIENTS HERBS SOMETIMES THEY GO INTO THE MUSHROOM CATEGORY IN THESE ARE NON A PSYCHADELIC MUSHROOMS THAT PROVIDE EITHER SOME BOFFERING TO THE STRA SYSTEM BY REDUCING CORTISAL TYPICALLY OR THAT ARE THOUGHT TO OR KNOWN TO BASED ON RESEARCH STUDIES TO ENHANCE THINGS LIKE BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN OR TO ENHANC SOME ASPECT OF COGNIVE FUNCTION BY WAY OF ENHANCING NEURO TRANSMITTER FUNCTION THIS CATEGORY OF SO CALLED ADAPTIGENS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE WILL GET BACK TO THE SYLOBIT LATER THE REASON I MENTION IT NOW IS THAT IT IS INDEED HARD TO GET THE SO CALLED ADAPTIGENS IN SUFFICIENT CONCENTRATIONS FROM FOOD BASED SOURCES  HAVE TO ASSUME THAT MOST PEOPLE AREN'T OUT THEIRE COLLECTING CHOGA MUSHROOM OR THE ASHUAGON TO HERBS AND THEN COMBINING THEM WITH THEIR SALIDS THEIR FOODS AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS ADAPTAGIN CATEGORY FITS INTO FOUNDATIONAL NOW THIS OPENS UP THE CATEGORY OF FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE BROAD SPECTRUM THAT IS THAT INCLUDE VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT HAVE DIGESTIVE ENZIMES THAT HAVE ADAPTIGENS AND THAT ALSO HAVE PREBIOTICS AND PROBIOTICS AT THE APPROPRIATE DOSAGES THIS IS ONE REASON WHY AM A BIG FAN OF SUPPLEMENTS LIKE ATHLETIC GREENS WHICH IS MANY IF YOU KNOW A SPONSE OR THIS PODCAST AND DOES REALLY NICELY COVER ALL F THESE CATEGORIES OF FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION BUT I DO ONE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A WAY TO FOCUS ON ATHLETIC GREEN SPECIFICALLY THERE ARE OTHER CATEGORIES AND BRANDS OF EXCELLENT FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT COVER THESE CATEGORIES OF VITEMENS AND MINERALS PROBIOTICS PREBOTICS DIGESTIVE END TIMES AN ADAPTAGENS IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THAT ATHLETIC GREENS IS THE ONE THAT I DISCOVERED AND THAT WORKS BEST FOR ME AND THAT MANY PEOPLE FIND WORKS REALLY WELL FOR THEM SO THIS IS WHY WHEN PEOPLE APPROACH ME AND THEY ASK ME AS THEY OFTEN DO VERY VERY OFTEN DO I SHOULD SAY IF I'M ONLY GOING TO TAKE ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT SUPPLEMENT SHOULD I TAKE RATHER THAN JUST GIVE THEM ONE SPECIF ICGANCER I ACTUALLY ASK THEM THREE QUESTIONS FIRST QUESTION I ASK THEM IS HOW WELL ARE YOU SLEEPING AT NIGHT ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP ARE YOU WAKING UP FEELING RESTED BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT THAT OPENS UP A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF INTERACTIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AND DISCUSSIONS AROUND WHAT SORTS OF THINGS THEY NEED TO DO AND POSSIBLY TAKE IN ORDER TO GET THEIR SLEEP RIGHT BECAUSE SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WE WILL HAVE THAT DISCUSSION A LOBIT LATER IN THIS EPISODE THE SECOND QUESTION I ASKE THEM IS HOW'S YOUR NUTRITION THAT IS ARE YOU EATING REGULARLY HAVE YOU FOUND THE COMMINATION OF MACRO NEUTREENTS OR WHICH DIET IS RIGHT FOR YOU DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH VIDEMENS MINERALS HAS YOUR DIGESTION WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND THEN THE THIRD THING THAT I ASK WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY HAS TEN DOLLARS A MONTH TOTAL TO SPEND ON SUPPLEMENTS VERSEES A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TO SPEND ON SUPPLEMENTS TOTAL WELL THEN THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD AS TO WHAT SUPPLEMENTS THEY SHOULD TAKE NOW ONCE THOSE THREE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED ASSUMING THAT SOMEBODY IS ABLE TO SPEND ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE ON SUPPLEMENTS PER MONTH THEN MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THEY NOT FOCUS ON ANY SPECIFIC SUPPLEMENTS DIRECTED TOWARD SLEEP OR TOWARD FOCUS OR HORMONAUGMENTATION BUT RATHER THAT THEY FOCUS ON BUFFERING AND ENHANCING THEIR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION ADAPTAGENS PROBOTICS PREBOTICS AND DIGESTIVE END ZIMES BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE FACT THAT IF THEY DO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RAISE THE TIDE ON ALL THE BIOLOGICAL AN ORGAN SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOINGT LEAD TO ENHANCED MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE INCLUDING SLEEP SO THIS IS ONE REASON WHY IF PEOPLE SAY WELL IF I CAN ONLY TAKE ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT SHOULD I TAKE I SAY WELL WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET IF THEY SAY THEY CAN MEET THAT HUNDRED DOLLAR THRESHOLD PER MONTH THEN MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE ATHLETIC GREENS OR SOMETHING LIKE IT OR THAT THEY INVEST THE TIME AND ENERGY TO GO FIND THE VARIOUS COMMINATIONS OF VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND PROBIOTICS AND PREPIOTICS AND ADAPTIGENS AND SO FORTH IN INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS THAT THEY CAN THEN TAKE IN COMMINATION IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR FOUNDATIONAL NEEDS BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN DOING ALL THAT HOMEWORK AND LEG WORK TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE DOSAGES ARE THAT'S ONE REASON WHY INDEED I HAVE TAKEN ATHLETI GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I LIKE IT IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER I HAVE MORE ENERGY I SLEEP BETTER MY DIGESTION IS CERTAINLY BETTER IN ITS SUPPORTS TIK OT MY CROBI I DO THAT FOR THAT REASON BUT AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE OTHER GREAT SOURCES OF ALL THE RELEVANT THINGS WITHIN THOSE FOUNDATIONAL FORMULAS THAT ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAINS SO IT CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY ROUTE TO COVERING YOUR FOUNDATIONAL HEALTH NEEDS THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO THAT NOW IF SOMEBODY HAS A BUDGET LOWER THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH TO SPEND ON FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION WELL THEN THEIR COUPLE OF DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD NOW IF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY HAVE TO DEVOTE TO FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION IS ZERO OF COURSE RESPECT THAT AND THEN IT BECOMES A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF FOODS AND PATTERNS OF FOODIEN TAKE ARE GOING TO BEST SUPPORT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE NOW IF SOMEBODY HAS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ZERO DOLLARS AND FIFTY DOLLARS TO SPEND ON SUPPLEMENTATION FORSAKE OF THIS THING WERE CALLING FOUNDATIONAL HEALTH PER MONTH WELL THEN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENT DISCUSSION ARISES AND WILL HAVE THAT IN A MOMENT BUT THE SORT OF CLOSE THE CONVERSATION ON FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION YEND THAT MEANS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ITS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS SOMETIMES THATS ONE VITEMENT AN MINERAL SUPPLEMENT IT MEANS DIGESTIVE ENZIMES THAT COULD BE ITS OWN SUPPLEMENT OR IN FOMDATION IN VIDEMENS MERALS IT MEANS OFTEN NOT ALWAYS ADAPTAGENS THINGS LIKE OSHUAGONDA DIFFERENT ON PLANT BASE AND MUSHROOM BASED FORMULATIONS THAT CAN BUFFER STRESS AND PROVIDE OTHER BRAIN ANBODY SUPPORT AND IT OFTEN ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS BUT SHOULD I BELIEVE INCLUDE THE PROBIOTICS AND PREBOTICS OR ANYTHING THAT SUPPORTS HEALTHY GOT MY CROBIOM ONCE AGAIN I THINK A BROAD SPECTRUM SUPPLEMENT THAT HAS MANY MANY INGREDIENTS OF HIGH QUALITY THAT COVERS ALL THESE BASES IS GOING TO BE THE BEST ROUT TO INSURING FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION IS COVERED AND I DO THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE STARTING PLACE FOR ANY AND ALL SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMENTS I'LL SEY THAT ONCE AGAIN I THINK COVERING YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NEEDS IN THE REALM OF VITEMENTS MINERALS PROBATIC DIGESTIVE EN TIMES AND ADAPTIGENS IS GOING TO GIVE YOU THE MOST BENEFIT BY COST AND THE MOST BENEFIT ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF BRAIN EMBODY SYSTEMS THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO FEEL BETTER OVER ALL SLEEP BETTER OVER ALL FOCUS BETTER OVER ALL AND SUPPORT ALL THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN YOUR BRAIN ANBODY THAT ARE GIN ALLOW YOU TO BE AT YOUR BEST WILL OF COURSE ALSO PAYING CAREFUL ATTENTION TO YOUR NUTRISION BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CANNOT ABANDON NUTRICION AGAIN BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY STILL REQUIRES BETTER LIVING SO NOW THAT WE'VE HADE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION AND AGAIN HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT THAT'S THE ONE CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTATION WHERE MOULTI INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS MAKE THE MOST SENSE I'D LIKE TO NOW SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATION SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNE TO ACHIEVE SPECIFIC AND POINTS AND HERE AGAIN RATHER THAN FOCUS ON SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS TO ACHIEVE SPECIFICTC IM POINTS BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THAT ALREADY IN EPISODES RELATE TO SLEEP AND FOCUS ET CETERA I'D LIKE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND FOCUS ON THEM LARGER THEME OF TO DAY'S EPISODE WHICH IS HOW TO THINK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION IN A RATIONAL COST EFFECTIVE IN BIOLOGICALLY EFFECTIVE WAY FOR EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES AND THE THREE CATEGORIES THAT I 'M GOING TO COVER OR SLEEP HORMON SUPPORT AND COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT AND FOCUS COGNUMEN HANCEMEN IN FOCUS BEING THE FINAL THIRD CATEGORY LET'S TALK ABOUT SLEEP AND THE RATIONAL APPROACH TO THINKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION FOR SLEEP AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS EPISODE AND ON MANY PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THIS PODCAST SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE YOU MIGHT BE SOMEBODY WHO CAN DO IN ALL NIGHT OR AND FEEL OCAY THE NEXT DAY OR MAYBE EVEN GREAT BUT MOST EVERYBODY ONCE THEY START TO HAVE MINIMAL SLEEP FOR ONE OR TWO NIGHTS IN THE FORM A BROKEN SLEEP POOR SLEEP NOT ENOUGH SLEEP OR SLEEPING AT THE WRONG TIME OF NIGHT THERE IS SUCH A THING OR DAY THEY START TO SUFFER THEIR MOOD STARTS TO SUFFER THEIR COGNATIVE CLARITY AND PERFORMANCE TARTS TO SUFFER THEIRE MENTAL HEALTH CAN SUFFER SEVERELY AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE DEFINIELY SUFFERS HORMON SUFFER EVERYTHING SUFFERS CONVER SLEEP WHEN PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING WELL THAT IS DEEPLY END EN NOUGH EIGHTY POR SEND OF THE NIGHTS OF THEIR LIFE MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE ALL FLOURISH AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE START TO BE ALMOST AMAZED AT HOW WELL THEY'RE DOING IN VARIOUS DOMAINS OF LIFE THAT PREVIOUS SLY THEY MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH SO SLEEP ISS FUNDAMENTAL UT'S THAT'S TO STABLISHED WHEN THING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION FOR SLEEP WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONE FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOULD ASK YOURSELF HOW WELL THAT IS HOW DEEPLY AND HOW MUCH YOU SLEEPING PER NIGHT ASSUMING YOUR SOMEBODY WHO CAN FALL ASLEEP EASILY STAY SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT WAKE UP FEELING RELATIVELY RESTED MAY BE LITTLE GROGGY AND THEN CAN MOVE ABOUT YOUR DAY WITH PLENTY OF ENERGY AND FOCUS YOU'RE NOT FALLING ASLEEP IN CLASS OR IT WERE OR BEHIND THE WHEEL WHEREIS A PASSENGER ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WELL THEN YOUR PROBABLY GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP AND BY THE WAY IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL TO REQUIRE ANYWHERE FROM A TEN MINUTE TO A NINETY MINUTE NAP IN THE AFTERNOON FOR SOME PEOPLE IF YOU'RE NOT A NAPPER NO BEG DEAL IT'S KNOWN THAT NAPS CAN DISTRUPT NIGHT TIME SLEEP BUT PROVIDED THAT THERE EARLY ENOUGH IN THE DAY IF YOU TAKE A NAP AND YOU ARE STILL ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT THEN NAPS ARE FINE FOR YOU IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T LIKE NAPS AS YOU WAKE UP GROGGY OR GRUMPY WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS TO CERTAIN PEOPLE THEN DON'T NAP YOU CERTAINLY DO NOT NEED TO NAP BUT IF YOU'RE FEELING ENERGETIC THROUGHOUT THE DAY CHANCES ARE YOU'R GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE OF COURSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH SLEEP EITHER FALLING ASLEEP STAYING ASLEEP OR THEIRE NOT FEELING ALERT ENOUGH DURING THE DAY OR ALL OF THE ABOVE AND THEN TOT MAKE SENSE TO STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT SUPPLEMENTATION CAN PROVIDE IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO IS NOT SLEEPING ENOUGH OR WELL ENOUGH AT NIGHT THAT YOU ARE SUFFERING DURING THE DAY IN WHATEVER WAY MILD TO SEVERE THEIR TWO QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ASK YOURSELF FIRST OF ALL ARE YOU IN GESTING CAFFINE AFTER TO P M IF THE ANSWER IS YES YOU WANT TO LIMIT OR ELIMINATE CAFFINE AFTER TWO P M MAY BEV EN PUSH IT BACK TO NOON OR EARLIER I KNOW THAT CAN BE EXCRUCIATING FOR SOME FOLKS BUT I CAN REALLY HELP WITH YOUR ABILITY TO FALL AND STAY ASLEEP AT NIGHT SECOND THING IS MOST PEOPLE WOULD DO WELL TO AVOID FOOD WITHIN THE TWO HOURS PRIOR TO BEDTIME BUT OF COURSE YOU DON'T ONE TO BE SO HUNGRY THAT YOU CAN'T FALL ASLEEP SO THOSE ARE THE A NUTRICIAN AN BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO CONSIDER IF YOU ARE NOT IN JESTING KAFFINE TWO P M OR ONWARDS AND YOU ARE NOT EATING EXCESSIVELY IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO BEDTIME OR WITHIN THE TWO HOURS PRIOR TO BEDTIME AND YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP WELL THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN SUPPORT YOUR SLEEP AND WEVE TALKED ABOUT THESE IN THE PERFECT SLEEP EPISODE AND IN THE EPISODE WITH OUR GESTS EXPERT MAT WALKER FROM UNIVERSIY CALFORNIA BIRKLY END IN THE MASTER YOUR SLEEP EVISOE AND WE HAVE A TOOL KIT FOR SLEEP YOU CAN ACTS USS ZERO COST BY GOING HEERIN LAVDOT CAMMAN GOING TO THE MEN YOU GO T NEW SLITTER N COFIND THAT TOOL KIT YOU SIGN UPT FOR OTHER FREE TOOL KITS LIKE IT BUT THE POINT HERE IS NOT TO GO SYSTEMATICALLY THROUGH EACH OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT IS BENEFICIAL OR HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR SLEEP BUT RATHER TO A DRESS SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF SLEEP THAT CAN SUFFER AND WHY AND HOW CERTAIN PATTERNS OF SUPPLEMENTATION CAN SUPPORT OR ELLEVIATE THOSE PAIN POINTS IF FOR INSTANCE YOURE SOMEBODY WHO FALLS ASLEEP JUST FINE BUT WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AROUND TWO OR THREE A M OR ANY TIME FOR THAT MATTER AND HAS TROUBLE FALLING BACK ASLEEP THEIR TWO CATEGORIES OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THE FIRST IS MYOAN OCITAL TIPICALLY TAKEN AS NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF MAYO AN OCITA MYOAN OCITAL CAN HELP SHORT IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TAKES TO FALL BACK ASLEEP IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT MYOAN OCITAL HAS OTHER BENEFICIAL USES AS WELL FOR MOOD AT CETERA IF YOU LIKE TO SEE MANY OF THE DIFFERENT EFFECTS THAT HAVE BEN EXPLORT IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE FROM MYON OCITAL YOU CAN GO TO EXAMINE DOCK COMMENTS AND EXCELLENT SIT NOTCUST FOR IN NOCITAL BUT FOR ALL SUPPLEMENTS FOR THAT MATTER TALKS BUT THE HUMAN EFFECT MA TRICKS THAT IS THE DIFFERENT AFFECTS OF DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENT COMPOUNDS ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HORMON BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS WEAK HAS LINK TO STUDIES AND SO ON AGAIN ITS EXAMINEDOK COMMAMAZING WEBSITE WONDERFUL WEBSITE PROVIDED SUCH A RICH RESOURCE FOR ME AN FOR YOU MANY MANY OTHER PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT WAKE UP BECAUSE THEIR DREAMS ARE VERY INTENSE OR THEY WERE HAVING DREAMS THAT WERE SO VIVID THAT SUDDENLY THEY WERE JOLTED FROM THEIR DREAMS THOSE PEOPLE WOULD DO WELL TO AVOID CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS SO IN A MOMEN I'LL TALK ABOUT THE VALUE OF A SUPPLEMENT CALLED FHEANINE FOR FALLING ASLEEP BUT FHEANINE WHICH TYPICALLY IS TAKEN IN DOSAGES ANYWHERE FROM ONE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS DEPENDING ON ODY WAIT AND EXPERIENCE AND WHAT YOU FIND TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR YOU MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE FOR YOU WELL THE INIUN CAN BE GREAT FOR MANY PEOPLE BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXCESSIVELY VIVID DREAMS THOSE EXCESSIVELY VIVID DREAMS CAN LEAD TO IMMEDIATE WAKING AND SOMETIMES A LIMIT OF ANXIETY UPON WAKING IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT SO SOME PEOPLE WHO WAKE UP IN THE MILLE THE NIGHT SO JOLTED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY OUT OF SLEEP BECAUSE OF THEIR INTENSE DREAMS WOULD DO WELL TO AVOID THENIAN SUPPLEMENTATION TALKES ABOUT THIS A BIT BEFORE BUT AND SOMETHING THAT I THINK A LOT OF NIGHT TIME MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WAKERS MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH AND WOULD WANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT WAKING UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT OR NOT HAVING EXCESSIVELY VIVID DREAMS BUT ARE HAVING TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP TWO SUPPLEMENTS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR SHORTENING THE TRANSITION TIME TO SLEEP IN ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EASINTO SLEEP MORE READILY AND THOSE ARE MAGNESIUM THREE INATE WHICH IS INTERCHANGEABLE WITH MAGNESIUM BISSGLICENATE MGNESIUM BISC LICENATE AND MAGNESIUM THREE INATE BOTH HAVE TRANSPORTER SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO READILY CROSS THE BLUBRING BARRIER AND THEY LEAD TO A MILD FORM OF DROWSINESS MILD IN THE SENSE THAT IS NOT GOING TO PREVENT YOU FROM OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR KIND OF ANY ON CONDITIONS UNDER EMERGENCY THAT MIGHT ARISE IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT OR IF THEY DID ARISER IN THEMILL NIGHT YOU STILL BE ABLE TO FUNCTION SO AS NOLKE ASLEEPING PILL BUT PEOPLE WHO TAKE THOSE OFTEN FIND THAT THEIR TRANSITION TIME INTO SLEEP IS MUCH FASTER IN THEIR SLEEP IS ALSO MUCH DEEPER INCIDENTALLY THOSE SUPPLEMENTS ALSO THOUGHT TO BE USEFUL FOR COGNATIVE SUPPORT AND NURO PROTECTION ALTHOUGH THEIRE'S LESS DATA ON THAT IS THAT'S FOR FALLING SLEEP THAT'S ONE CATEGORY EITHER MAGNESIUM MAGNESIUM THREE NATE OR BISCLICIN IT WOULD BE INTERCHANGEABLE FOR ASSISTING THE TRANSITION TIME INTO SLEEP AND THEN THE OTHER SETTLEMENT IS APIGEN AND A P I G E AN IEN APIGENAN WHICH IS A DERIVIT OF CAMUMEAL IVE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN VARIOUS PODCASTS BEFOR ALSO ACTS AS A BIT OF A ANXIETY LOWERING COMPOUND WHICH IS ESSENTIAL PRIOR TO SLEEP FOR PEOPLE TO ESSENSHALLY TURN OFF THEIR THINKING OR TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RUMINATING AND PROBLEM SOLVING AND FUTURE ANTICIPATION TAT THEIR DOING WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT FOR FALLING ASLEEP SO WHAT'S THE RATIONAL APPROACH TO SUPPLEMENTING IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FALL ASLEEP MORE QUICKLY AND STAY ASLEEP WELL WOULD YOU IMMEDIATELY TAKE MAGNESIUM THREE NATE AN APIGENAN TOGETHER WOR THAT DEPENDS IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET AND YOU JUST SIMPLY ONE A FALL ASLEEP QUICKER AND YOU DON'T CARE WHICH OF THOSE TWO INGREDIENTSIS GOING TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR YOU WOR THEN YOU COULD TRY ONE FOR INSTANCE MAGNESIUM THREE INATE AND TRY IT FOR PERHAPS A WEEK AND SEE HOW THAT AFFECTS YOUR LATENCY TO SLEEP TIME THAT IS SOW QUICKLE FALL ASLEEP OR YOU TRY APIGENAN IN THE FIRST WEEK OR YOU COULD COMBINE THEM BOTH OR YOU COULD TRY MAGNESIUM THREE NAHTE FOR WEEK THAN SWITCH TO ONLY APPIGENAN FOR A WEEK AND EVALUATE WHICH ONE WORKS BETTER FOR YOU IF NEITHER WORKS FOR YOU I DO RECOMMEND TRYING THE COMMINATION TOGETHER AGAIN THIS IS JUST THE WAY THAT ANY S IENTIST WOULD DESIGN AN EXPERIMENT TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHICH VARIABLES THAT IS WHICH INGREDIENTS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE RESULT THAT YOU WANT AS APPOSE TO JUST LUMPING THEM TOGETHER ANDTAKING THEM THAT SAID A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT EXCELLENT SLEEP SO BADLY THAT THEY JUST SAY OKHAIM JUST GOIN TO TAKE MAGNESIUM THREE NATE IMAN TAKE UP AGEIN AND OMEN TO TIKE THEANINE IF MY DREAMS ARE TOO VIVID AND I'M WAKING UP INTHE MILL THE NIGHT FROM EXCESSIVELY VIVID DREAMS I'LL DROP THE THEANINE AND MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY DERIVE GREAT BENEFIT FROM THAT APPROACH BUT BECAUSE TODAY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MOST RATIONAL COST EFFECTIVE AND BIOLOGICALLY EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO SUPPLEMENTATION IF YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING AS WELL AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO OR IF YOU WANT TO EXPLORE WHAT SLEEPING EVEN MORE DEEPLY MIGHT DO FOR YOUR MENTAL HEAL PHYSICAL HEALTH AN PERFORMANCE WILL THEN TO MAKE SENSE TO THINK ABOUT THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS FOR FALLING ASLEEP VERSES REMAINING ASLEEP WHAT TO INCLUDE WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE AND TO DO THAT SYSTEMATICALLY AND AGAIN I THINK ONE WEEK'S TIME OF TAKING SOMETHING PROVIDED IT DOESN'T INDUCE ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS IGHT IF SOMETHNG INDUCES A NEGATIVE EFFACT I RECOMMEND CEASING TAKING IT IMMEDIATELY BUT IF SOMETHING DOES NOT PRODUCE ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAN I THINK YOU WANT TO TRY A SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATION FOR ABOWT A WEEK WHILE NOT VARYING ANYTHING ELSE NOT CHANGING ANYTHING ELSE IN YOUR OVER ALL PROTOCALSE OF NUTRITION OR SUPPLEMENTATION IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CLAMP EVERYTHING PERFECTLY FROM WEEK TO WEEK BUT YOUT DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE DRAMATICALLY AND JUST ADD THAT SUPPLEMENT FOR A GIVEN WEEK SEE HOW IT BENEFITS YOUR SLEEP MAY BE ADD IN A SECLENTS SECOND SUPPLEMENT IF YOU LIKE OR RATHER SWAP AND TRY A DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENT FOR A WEEK AND THEN SEE WHAT WORKS BEST AND SEE IF THE COMMINATION WORKS EVEN BETTER NOW I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS EXCEEDINGLY BASIC BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE DO MOST PEOPLE EITHER DECIDE THEY HAVE THE BUDGET AND THE INTEREST IN JUST IMPROVING THEIR SLEEP ACROSS THE BOARD AND THEY DON'T CARE WHAT INGREDIENT IS PROVIDING THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT OR THEY SIMPLY TRY SOMETHING AND DECIDE OH WELL IT DIDN'T WORK FOR MEIENT SO I'M NOT ON A TRY ANYTHING ELSE SUPPLEMENTS DON'T WORK FOR ME OR MAGNESIUM DOESN'T WORK FOR ME OR AM YOU KNOW I WONKE UP IN THE MILL THE IGHT FROM VIVID DREAMS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING MORE OF A SHOCK UN APPROACH WITHOUT TEASING OUT THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES IN FACT T IF THRE'S AN OVERIDING THEME OF TO DAY'S CONVERSATION IT'S REALLY ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO ISILY VARIABLES IN THE REALM OF SUPPLEMENTATION BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO THAT AND ONCE YOU START TO DEVELOP THAT INTUITIONERS OR SENSITIVITY OF SORTS TO HOW DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS IMPACT YOU IT IS AN ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL STANDS TO HAVE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR COSTS LIMITED YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO FIND THE THINGS THAT WORK PARTICULARLY POORLY FOR YOU AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE THINGS THAT WORK PARTICULARLY WELL FOR YOU TOWARD YOUR GOLES ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION FOR SLEEP I FEEL HAS TO INCLUDE A DISCUSSION ABOUT MELETONAN I'VE TALKED ABOUT MELETONAN BEFORE OR NUMEROUS PODCASTS MINE AND OTHERS AND I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN I AM NOT A PHANA MELETONAN FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS MALTONEIS A HORMONE KNOWN TO INDUCE SLEEPINESS BUT NOT KEEP US ASLEEP SO OFTEN TINHS PEOPLE TAKE MLATONI AND FALL DEEPLY SLEEP AND THEN AWAKE UP AND HAVE TROUBLE FALLING BACK OF SLEEP THE OTHER REASON IS THAT MELATONAN SUPPLEMENTS ALMOST ALWAYS INCLUDE LEVELS OF MELATONIAN OR MOUNTS A MELATONAN THAT FAR FAR EXCEED THE NORMAL BIOLOGICAL LEVELS ARE SO CALLED INDOGINOUS LEVELS OF MELATONAN THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY PRODUCE AND YES IT'S TRUE THAT AS WE AGE ROULD PRODUCE LESS MELATONAN BUT MELATONAN AS A HORMONE ALSO IMPACTS OTHER HORMONE SYSTEMS IN PARTICULAR THE REPRODUCTIVE HORMONE ACESS TO SOCERONE ESTERGEN ET CETERA JUST NOT TO SAY THATIF YOU'VE BEEN TAKING MELATONE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU'VE DESTRUPTED YOUR FERTILITY OR THOSE HORMONE AXIS BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU'VE DISTRUPTED THEM SOME WHAT AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT MELATONAN CAN IMPACT NOT JUST SLEEP BUT OTHER SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY IT CAN BE USEFUL FOR JET LAG AND FOR OCCASIONAL USE BUT THERE ALSO I WANT TO A VOICE A MESSAGE OF CAUTION THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES EXPLORING THE DOSAGES OF MELATONAN CONTAINED IN VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS AND WHETHER OR NOT WHAT'S LISTED ON THE BOTTLE MATCHES WHAT'S ACTUALLY CONTAINED IN THOSE FORMULATIONS AND DESPITE THOSE FORMULATIONS COMING FROM QUITE RELIABLE COTANQUOTE OR THOUGHT TO BE RELIABLE SOURCES WAS FOUND THAT THESE SUPPLEMENTS CONTAIN ANYWHERE FROM FIFTEEN PER CENT OF WHAT'S THOUGHT TO BE OR IS TOLD TO BE IN THOSE SUPPLEMENTS OR MANY TIMES MORE MELATONAN THAN IS LISTED ON THE BOTTLE SO THE DOSAGING DOES NOT SEEM TO BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S OFTEN LESTED ON THE BOTTLE THIS IS EVEN TRUE WITHIN SOME OF THE MORE REPUTABLE BRANDS SO THAT'S OF OF REAL CONCERN SO WE NEED TA HIGHLIKE MELATONAN AS PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT'S ONLY USED OCCASIONALLY YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT DOSAGES FOR MELATONAN USE FOR JET LAG AT CETERA GO TO EXAMINE DOT COM THERE SOME EXCELLENT OM REFERENCES TO STUDIES THERE JUST PUT MELATONAN IN THE SEARCH FUNCTION ILLTILL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MELATONAN BUT NOW YOU KNOWN MY STANCE ON MELATONAN ONE QUESTION I OFTEN GET ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION FOR SLEEP IS DOES IT CREATE A DEPENDENCY THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION TO ASK THINK MOST PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT EVEN FEAR RELYING ON SOMETHING SO HEAVILY THAT IF THEY DID NOT HAVE IT FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT THEY COULDN'T SLEEP IN MY EXPERIENCE THERE IS NO PROBLEM FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP IN THE ABSENCE OF A SUPPLEMENT FOR SLEEP EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN TAKING THAT SUPPLEMENT FOR SLEEP CONSISTENTLY SEVENDAYS A WEEK FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS MAY BE E YEARS ON END I CONFESS THAT I OCCASIONALLY FALL ASLEEP HAVING NOT TAKEN MY PRESLEEP SUPPLEMENTS AND I HAPPEN TO TAKE MANESIUM THREE AND EIGH THENING AND APAGENAN I ALSO TAKE A NOCITOL O IT GREATLY ENHANCES MY SLEEP AND THERE BENIGHTS WHEN I FALL ASLEEP NOT HAVING TAKEN ANY OF THOSE THINGS AND I'VE SLEPT FINE THAT SAID IF I WERE TO EXPLORE MULTIPLE NIGHTS OF TRYING TO SLEEP WITHOUT THAT SUPPLEMENTATION I FIND THAT MY SLEEP IS NOT AS GOOD I'M STILL ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP BUT THE DEPTH OF MY SLEEP AND THE DURATION OF MY SLEEP IS NOT AS GOOD AS WHEN I 'M SUPPLEMENTING SO I THINK THAT'S REFRESHING NEWS AT LEAST TO ME THAT THERE ISN'T A DEPENDENCE ON THESE SUPPLEMENTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP IT'S NOT THE SAME SORT OF DEPENDENCE THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCS FROM THINGS LIKE SLEEPING PILLS THAT SAID ANY COMPOUND ANY COMPOUND CAN CREATE A PLUCEBO TYPE OF FACT WHERE WE THINK WE NEED SOMETHING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A CERTAIN EFFACT IM WE HAD A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST SOME TIME AGO IM DOCTOR ALLYCROME WOS A PROFESSOR AT STAMFORD AND WORKS ON THESE MIND SET EFFACTS BELEEF EFFACTS AND PLASEBO EFFECTS AND PLUSEBO EFFECTS CAN BE VERY REAL A AND IN SOME SENSE DOVE TAIL WITH ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT DEPENDENCE MEANING IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO LOVES YOUR SLEEP SUPPLEMENTS AND SLEEPS GREAT WITH THEM AND UONE NIGHT YOU DISCOVER YOU DON'T HAVE THEM OR YOU CAN'T ACCISS EM FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT CAN CREATE A LOWLE BIT OF AN ANXIETY AROUND THE IDEA THAT OWING IN THEIR ABSENCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP AND THAT'S A SORT OF A PLUCEBO EFFECT IN REVERSE IF YOU WILL BECAUSE WHAT IT SUGGESTS IS THAT THERE'S A  EMOTIONAL AR A COGNATIVE ASSOCIATION WHITH TAKING THESE THINGS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SLEEP WELL I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE EXPLORE THIS ISSUE OF DEPENDENCY AND PLUSEBO EFFECTS FOR SLEEP SUPPLEMENTS ON THEIR OWN AND UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH THERE'S NOTHING PRESSING THE NEXT DAY THAT IS YOU DON' HAVE EVERY PRESENTATION ET CETERA SO WHAT I RECOMMEND IS THAT EVERY TWO WEEKS OR SO MAY BE EVERY MONTH OR SO TAKE ONE NIGHT OFF COMPLETELY FROM ALL YOUR SLEEP SUPPLEMENTS OR LEAVE OUT ONE SLEEP SUPPLEMENT TRY TO UNDERSTAND TO WHAT EXTENT YOU MIGHT HAVE ESTABLISHED A DEPENDENCY EITHER REAL OR PLUCEBO BASED ON THESE SLEEP SUPPLEMENTS AND AGAIN I SUGGEST DOING THIS ON PERHAPS A FRIDAY NIGHT SO THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A WEEKEN THE NEXT DAYS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK IF PERHAPS YOU DON'T SLEEP WELL THINK WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE FIND AND THAT'S IN THE ABSENCE OF TAKING YOUR SUPPLEMENT STACK FOR SLEEP ONE NIGHT YOU'RE STILGEN A SLEEP JUST FINE NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT THESE SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY WORKING UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS WHERE YOU'RE TAKING THEM EACH NIGHT NO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT MANY OF THESE THINGS MAGNESIUMS IN PARTICULAR CAN BUILD UP IN THE BODY AND BRAIN IN A WAY THAT CAN BE BENEFICIAL AND WHAT PROBABLY EXPLAINS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN STILL SLEEP IF YOU MISS A NIGHT OF TAKING THEM IS THAT THE NOURAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN TURNING OFF THINKING OR NOT THINKING AND INFALLING ASLEEP THOSE NOURAL CIRCUITS UNDERGO WHAT'S CALLED PLASTICITY IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU GET BETTER AT FALLING IN STAYING A SLEEP OVER TIME EVEN IF YOU GOT BETTER AT THAT THROUGH THE ASSISTANCE OR WITH THE ASTSISTANCE OF SOME SUPPLEMENT OR COMMINATION OF SUPPLEMENTS WELL THEN THOSE CIRCUITS ARE STILL GOING TO FUNCTION JUST FINE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF NOT TAKING THE SUPPLEMENTS JUST ONTS WE'LL GET BACK INTO THIS CONVERSATION A LOABIT LATER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COGNATIVE ENHANCEMENT IN FOCUS THE SAME STOR RY THERE WHERE INDEED THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE IN STIMULANT FORM AND AND NON STIMULANT FORM THAT CAN ENHANCE COGNIVABILITY IN FOCUS BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU BECOME SO DEPENDENT ON THOSE THAT YOU CAN'T FOCUS UNLESS YOU TAKE THEM THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN MULTIBL TIMES OVER SO AGAIN TO ANSWER THE QUESTION IS THERE A DEPENDENCY ESTABLISHED BY TAKING SUPPLEMENTS FOR SLEEP THE SHORT ANSWER IS NOW WITH THE COBYACHT THAT PLOCIBO EFFECTS AND BELIEF EFFECTS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE AT PLAY WHETHER NOT YOU TALKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR EVEN BEHAVOR O PROTOCALS FOR THAT MATTER THE NEXT CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTATION THAT AD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS HORMON SUPPORT IMPROVING OR SO CALLED OPTIMIZING YOUR HORMONS IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WE'VE DONE MULTIPLE EPISODES ABOUT HORMONS IN CLUDING TESTOSTRON AND ESTEROGEN FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND FOR PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT AGES V ALSO HAD EPISODES ON FIRID HORMON GROWTH HORMON AND SO ON YOU CAN FIND ALL THOSE THAT HUBRON LABDOC COMIN FACT YOU CAN GO TO THE HUBERMAN LABDOC COM WEB SIGT THERE'S A SEARCH FUNCTION WE CAN JUST PUT IN A KEYWARD AND IT WILL TAKE YOU TO ALL THE EPISODES AND SPECIFIC TIME POINTS WHERE THAT TOPIC HAPPENS TO BE COVERED NOW HORMON HEALTH IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC TO DISCUSS IN THE CONTECTS OF SUPPLEMENTATION BECAUSE INDEED THERE ARE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE NON PRESCRIPTION BASE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN IMPROVE HORMON FUNCTION AGAIN ANY TIME WE ARE DISCUSSING A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH OR PERFORMANTS WE NEED TO START WITH A MENTION OF THE FEW BEHAVIORAL TOOLS  NUTRICION BASE TOOLS OR AT LEAST SOME TOP CONTOUR COVERAGE OF THOSE IN A WAY THAT FRAMES UP THE DISCUSSION ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION APPROPRIATELY SO IN THE CONTECTS OF HORMON SUPPORT AN AUGMENTATION EN OPTIMIZATION IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING ADEQUATE CALORIES FROM HIGH QUALITY SOURCES HORMONS LIKE TESTOSTERON AND ESTEROGEN WILL SUPFER THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WOMEN WILL STOP HAVING THEIR PERIODS IF THEY'RE NOT INGESTING ENOUGH CALORIES THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TESTOSTERON LEVELS WILL DROP IF PEOPLE ARE NOT INGESTING NOUGH CALORIES IN FACT ON THE EPISODE WITH EXPERT GUEST AND MEDICAL DOCTOR PETERATEA HE DESCRIBED HOW SEX HORMON BINING GLOBULANE THIS IS A AAPPROACHING THAT'S PRESENT IN MALES AND FEMALES THAT BINDS TO TESTOSTRON AND OTHER HORMONS AND PREVENTS IT FROM BEING IN ITS FREE FORM WHICH IS THE MORE ACTIVE FORM WELL INSOLEN WHICH OF COURSE HAS GOING TO INCREASE AFTER THE INGESTION OF CARBOHYDRATES IN PARTICULAR INSOLEN ACTUALLY INHIBITS OR REDUCESEXHORMON BINING GLOBULANE THIS MEANS IS THAT FOR YOU INTERMITTEN FASTERS OR PEOPLE THAT ARE INGESTING VERY FEW CARBOHYDRATES OR AF VERY LOW BLOOD LUCOS OR PERHAPS ARE TAKING THINGS LIKE MET FORMEN OR BERBERING WHICH IS A SUPPLEMENT BASED A APPROACH TO REDUCING BLOOD GLUCOS WELL YOUR SEX HORMON BINING GLOBULANE IS GOING TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY CONVERSELY IF YOU ARE EATING ENOUGH CALORIES IN THE FORM OF FOODS THAT ALLOW YOUR INSOLENT TO BE A BIT HIRER NOT EXCESSIVELY HIGH WE HOPE BUT IT A BIT HIGHER WELL THEN SEX HORMOMONIN GLOBULAN WILL GO DOWN AND FRE TESTOSTROM WILL GO UP SO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT HORMONES SUPPORT AND AUGMENTATION HAS TO INCLUDE SOME NOD TOARD OR UNDERSTANDING THE FACT THAT NUTRITION AND THE WAY THAT NUTRITION IMPACTS HORMONS AND THE WAY THAT HORMON SUCH AS INSOLENT IN PACT OTHER HORMONES SUCH AS FRE TESTOSTERON THAT ALL HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IS NOT THE TOPIC OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I REMIND EVERYBODY THAT NUTRITION MATTERS FOR GENERAL HORMON STATUS IT'S ALSO IMPORTAN T REMEMBER THAT BEHAVIORS MATTER FOR HORMON STATUS GETTING MORNING SUNLIGHT INCREASES CORTISALL LEVELS CORTIS ALL LEVELS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ELEVATED EARLY IN THE DAY FOR FOCUS AND ALERTNESS AND FROM UNFUNCTION AND TO MAKE SURE THAT CORTES ALL LEVELS ARE LO AT NIGHT AND THEREBY LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMON AND TESTOSTRON WHICH IS SECRETED MAINLY IN THE EARLY MORNING CAN BE ELEVATED AT NIGHT AND IN THE EARLY MORNING SO GTTING MORNING SUNLIGHT GETTING STRENUOUS EXERCISE IN THE FORM OF BOTH CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE BUT ALSO RELATIVELY SHORT MEANING AN HOUR OR LESS BOUTS OF INTENSE RESISTANCE TRAINING A FEW TIMES PER WEEK CAN ALSO DRAMATTICALLY ALTOR HORMON PROPHILES IN FACT IN THE EPISODE THAT WE DID WITH DOCTOR DUNKAN FRENCH AGAIN YOU FIND THAT EPISODE AT HURMAN LABDACOM HE DESCRIBE A VERY STRENUOUS BUT STILL BRIEF TWO DAY A WEEK PROTO CALL OF USING RESISTANCE TRAINING SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE TESTSTRON AND FRETESTOSTRON AND GROWTHORMON AND SO ON SO NUTRITION MATTERS EXERCISE MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO INCREASING SUPPORTING OR AUGMENTING DIFFERENT HORMONES AND THAT'S JUST THE DISCUSSION ABOUT TESTOSTROND FRETESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN THEREIS ALSO THE VAST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIROD HORMN AT CETERA AGAIN WE COVERED ALL THOSE TOPICS AND PREVIOUS EPISODES BUT ONCE THOSE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS ARE IN PLACE ONCE YOUR DOING THE RIGHT THINGS AND YOUR AVOIDING THE WRONG THINGS DOING THE RIGHT THINGS TO SUPPORT YOUR ORMONS AND AVOIDING THE THINGS THAT DIMINISH HORMONS IN THE WAYS THAT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL ONCE YOUR NUTRITION IS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT YOUR ORMONS THEN IT MAKE SENSE TO TURN AND CONSIDER WHAT SUPPLEMENTS CAN SUPPORT HORMONES BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU WANT TO GET YOUR BEHAVIORS AND YOUR NUTRITION CORRECT BEFORE YOU STARE THINKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION FOR HORMONS GAN I'LL REPEAT THAT GET YOUR NUTRITION AND YOUR BEHAVIORS CORRECT FORSAKE OF HORMONS AND FOR OTHER HEALTH PURPOSES BEFORE YOU START THINKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION FOR HORMONS AND CERTAINLY BEFORE YOU STARTHING ABOUT PRESCRIPTION BASE APPROACHES TO IMPROVING HORMONS ONCE ALL OF THOSE OTHER ELEMENTS ARE IN PLACE THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF AUGMENTING HORMONES COME IN TWO FORMS ONE ARE BROAD BAND SUPPORT FOR MULTIBLE HORMONES AND THEN THE OTHERS ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE DESIND TO INCREASE WHEN SOME CASES DECREASE SPECIF IC HORMONS ARE HORMON PATHWAYS SO LET'S CONSIDER EACH OF THOSE IN TANDUM THERE ARE ARE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS THINGS LIKE SHILAGI FOR INSTANCE SOMETHING FROM IRVADIC MEDICINE WHICH MAY MAINLY A HAS THE ACT OF INGREDIENT FOLVIC ACID WHICH IS KNOWN TO FOR INSTANCE INCREASE THINGS LIKE EFFISATE PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE WHICH IN WOMEN IS GOING TO INCREASE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF EGROWTH HENCE THE NAME PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMON A ITS GONTO STIMULATE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF FERTILITY ITS PRO FERTILE AND IN MALES CAN MAKE AFOR MORE SPERM PRODUCTION OR MORE MOTILE SPERM EFFISAGEES ALSO GOING TO INDIRECTLY INCREASE TESTASTRONAN MALES ITS KNOWN TO INCREASE LEBIDO IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES SO THINGS LIKE SHILAGI CAN INDEED AUGMENT MULTIPLE HORMONES AND SUPPORT MULTIPLE HORMON SYSTEMS GENERALLY IN THE DIRECTION OF PRO FERTILITY PRO LEBIDO AND INCREASING ESTROGEN AND TESTASTRUM NOW THERE ARE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS SUCH AS ASHUAGANDA THAT ALSO FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY OF AFFECTING MULTIBLE HORMONS ASCHUAGONDA IS A VERY POTENT SUPPLEMENT IN TERMS OF REDUSING CORTIZAL LEVELS IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE TESTASTRON LEVELS BUT PROBABLY INDIRECTLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE CORTIZAL AN TESTASTRON SORT OF EXISTS ON A SEA SAW IN TERMS OF PATHWAYS THERE ARE SEPARATE PATHWAYS BUT THOSE PATHWAYS INTERACT ENOUGH THAT WHEN CORTIZAL IS LOWERED IN GENERAL TESTASTRON TENDS TO INCREASE NOW IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WIT CERTAIN HORMONS LIKE ASHWAGANDA THAT YOU DON'T TAKE THEM FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AT A TIME AT HYDOSAGES IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE OF THE SPECIFICS AROUND ASHUAGANDA AND HOW LONG TO TAKE IT HOW TO CYCULATE ET CETERA PLE SEE OUR EPISODE ON MASTER STRESS PLEASE ALSO SEE THE EXAMINED O COMWEB SITE AND PUT IN ASHUAGONDA IT WILL GET INTO SOME OF THAT DESCRIPTION BUT SHILAGI ASHUAGANDA AND THINGS FOR INSTANCE LIKE EL CARNATINE A SUPPLEMENT THAT WE OFTEN DISCUSS IN TERMS OF FERTILITY BECAUSE IT CAN INDEED IMPROVE SPERMERS MOTILITY AND QUALITY AND EGQUALITY SO ITS PRO FERTILE COMPOUND BUT IT ALSO IMPACTS O VARIOUS MIGHTACONDREAL PATHWAY SO ITS HAVING A MORE INDIRECT EFFECT ON HORMONES THERE ARE MANY OTHER COMPOUNDS PRESENT AND AVAILABLE SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE PRURPORTED TO BE PRO HORMON SUPPORT IN PARTICULAR FOR TESTASTRONOR ESTROGEN FERTILITY AND LEBIDO THERE IS A DESCRIPTION FOR INSTANCE OF THINGS LIKE MACHO ROOT MACHA ROOT CAN INCREASE LBIDO ITS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN WOMEN BUT IN MEN AS WELL AND IN ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM LOWERED LEBIDO DUE TO INTAKE OF ESES ARISE SELECTIVE CERATON AND REUPTAKE IN HIBITERS FOR WHATEVER EASAN ECESSORIZER USED TO TREAT OSEEDY ITHER USED TO TREAT DEPRESSION ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS MAKHA ROOT CAN BE IN MANY INSTANCE IS EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING LEBIDO IT DOES THAT HOWEVER THROUGH AUGMENTATION OF DOPOMING RELATED PATHWAYS AND SOME OF THE HORMON PATHWAYS UPSTREAM OF TESTSTRON AND E STROGEN THE REPORTS THAT MACAT INCREASES TESTASTRON A ARE SOMEWHAT SCANT AND A LITTLEBIT WEAK TO BE HONEST SO IT'S HAVING THESE INDIRECT EFFECTS THAT MAY IMPACT TESTASTRON DOWNSTREAM SO CANNOT PUT MACA ALONGSIDE ASCHUOGANDA ALONGSIDE SHILOGY AS SUPPLEMENTS THAT AR IMPACTIMULTIBLORMON PATHWAYS TOWARD INCREASE LEBIDO INCREASE FERTILITY INCREASE TESTASTRONOR ESTROGEN LIKELY THROUGH INDIRECT PATHWAYS NOW WITH ALL THAT SAID LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT WORK MORE DIRECTLY ON SPECIFIC HORMON PATHWAYS AIMED AT ACHIEVING MORE SPECIFIC GOALS SUCH AS ELEVATED TESTASTRON OR ELEVATED FREE TESTASTRON OR ELEVATED GROWTH HORMON FOR THAT MATTER AND ELEVATED THIRORTHORMON I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT GROWTH HORMON FIRST BECAUSE IT'S ESHY A PRETTY SHORT DISCUSSION FIRST OF ALL THE BEST WAY TO AUGMENT GROWTH HORMON IS TO GET QUALITY DEEP SLEEP ESPECIALLY THE SLEEP THAT OCCURS IN THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR HOURS OF THE NIGHT IS WHEN GROWTH HORMON IS RELEASED AND IT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL TO AVOID COLORICIN TAKE IN THE TWO HOURS PRECEDING SLEEP AGAIN DON'T GO TO BED SO HUNGRY THAT YOU WAKE UP AN HOUR OR AN HOUR AND HALFHLATER OR YOU HAVE TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP BUT AVOIDING FOOD INTAKE IN THE TO HOURS PRIOR TO SLEEP AND CERTAINLY AVOIDING ALKOHOL AND CANABUS IS GOING TO FACILITATE GROWTH HORMON RELEASE IN THE FIRST HOURS OF SLEEP MANY PEOPLE USE INTERMITAN FASTING OR EVEN LONGER PERIODS OF FASTING TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS I LEARN FROM AN EXPERT GUEST DOCTOR CALGELETTE WHOSE A MEDICAL DOCTOR ON THIS PODCAST IS THAT INDEED WHILE LENGTHIER FASTS OR INTERMITTIN FASTING CAN INCREASE GROWTHORMON LEVELS VERY SUBSTANTIALLY IT HAS INDIRECT EFFECTS ON THE GENETIC PATHWAYS AND THE RECEPTORS FOR GROWTH HORMON THAT ACTUALLY ARE DETRIMENTAL FOR THE FUNCTION OF GROWTH HORMON SO AVOIDING FOOD FOR THE TWO HOURS PRIOR TO BEDTIME IS A GOOD IDEA IF YOU AVOID FOOD FOR LONGER THAT'S JUST GOING TO ASSIST EVEN MORE CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO HURT IN TERMS OF GROWTH HORMON RELEASE BUT EXTENDED FAST SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING GROWTH HORMON ARE NOT REALLY LOGICAL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BROADER EFFECTS OF EXTENDED FAST THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT EXTENDED FASTING IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR SOME PEOPLE IT CAN BE IN CERTAIN INSTANCES OR THAT INTERMITEN FASTED SO CALL TIME ORSTERCTIV FEEDING IS NOT BENEFICIAL FOR  SOME PEOPLE IT CAN BE HERE I'M ONLY REFERRING TO THE EFFECTS OR THIS CASE THE LACK OF EFFECTS OF INTERMITTENT FASTING TIME RESTRICTEV FEEDING ON GROWTH HORMON SPECIFICALLY NOW IN TERMS OF SUPPLEMENTS TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON THERE ARE VERY FEW SUPPLEMENTS THATHAVE BEEN SHOWN TO AUGMENT THIS PATHWAY THERE IS SOME IDEA THAT ARGENINE SUPPLEMENTATION PRIOR TO BEDTIME CAN FURTHER ELEVATE LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMON ESPECIALLY WHEN FASTED THAT LITERATURE IS RATHER WEAK TO BE HONEST I ENCURGE YOU TO GO TO EXAMINED OT COM IF YOU ON APPERUSE THOSE PARTICULAR STUDIES REALLY THESE THINGS THAT INCREASE GROWTH HORMON VERY POTENTLY FALL OUTSIDE THE REALM OF SUPPLEMENTATION THEY INCLUDE EXERCISE AGAIN LOOK AT THE DUNKEN FRENCH EPISODE OR IN THE CILE GOU LET EPISODE ON OPTIMIZING HORMONS FIN MALES AND PARTICULAR BUT THIS ALSO PRERTAINS THE FEMALES THAT AVOIDING FOOD TWO HOURS PRIVOR TO BEDTIME REALLY CAN BOOST GROWTH HORMON SIGNIFICANTLY IN SLEEP BEYOND WHAT IT WOULD BE OTHERWISE BUT IT'S REALLY ONLY ONCE YOU GET INTO THE REALM OF PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS THINGS LIKE PEPTIDES LIKE SARMORELLAN AH WHICH INCREASE IGIEF ON AND GROWTH HORMON THINGS LIKE GROWTHORMON ITSELF BY PRESCRIPTION O IF AND ONLY IF ITS PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR OF COURSE AND IS SAFE FOR YOU THAT'S WHEN YOU START GETTING INTO REALLY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON NOT A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS OUT THERE TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON POTENTLY NOW IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY WHEN YOU START THINKING ABOUT IN TALKING ABOUT TESTOSTRON AND FREE TESTOSTRON AND LUTINIZING HORMON LUINIZING HORMON IS RELEASED FROM THE PETUITARY WHICH IS THIS GLAND NOT FAR FROM THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH AND IT'S NEAR BY NEIGHBOR THE HYPOTHALMUS IS A COLLECTION OF NURONS THAT SITS ABOVE THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH AND TALKS TO THE PETUITARY TALKS TO IT THROUGH NURAL CONNECTIONS AND HORMON BASE CONNECTIONS THERE IS A HORMONE CALLED G N R H GANATITROP AN RELEASING HORMON THAT IS RELEASED FROM THE HYPOTHALMUS INTO THE PETUITARY ITS STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF LUTINIZING HORMON OR L H WHICH THAN TRAVELS IN THE BLOOD STREAM TO IMPACT MULTIPLE TISSUES IN THE BODY BUT MAINLY THE OVERY AN FEMALES IN THE TESTES AN MALES TO STIMULATE ESTROGEN PRODUCTION AND TESTOSTRON PRODUCTION THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN POTENTLY INCREASE G AND R H AND OR LUTINIZING A HORMON AND THEN INDIRECTLY INCREASE TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND I WAS LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE TESTSTRON AN ESTROGEN ARE PRESENT IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES AND BOTH ARE IMPORTANT FOR THINGS LIKE LIBIDO MUSCLE GROWTH AND SO ON LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT OH IN MALES YOU NOT HAVING VERY HIGH TESTOSTRON AND LOW ESTEROGEN IS ACTUALLY IDEAL IT'S ACTUALLY NOT IDEAL IF YOU WANTO KEEP YOUR LIBIDO ANYTHING THAT LOWERS YOUR ESTROGEN TOO FAR IS GOING TO REDUSE YOUR LEBIDO YOU DONT WANT ESTROGEN TOO HIGH BUT YOU ALSO DO NOT WANT IT TOO LOW SO SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN TICKLE THIS PATHWAY OR ACTUALLY CAN ACT AS A BIT MORE OF A DIRECTED HAMMER ON THIS LUTNIZING HORMON PATHWAY MAY ALSO IM PAGIAN OR H AR THINGS LIKE FIDOGIA AGRASTUS THIS IS IN HERB THAT I'VE TALKS ABOUT BEFORE IN THE PODCAST THAT WHEN TAKEN AT DOSAGES OF SIX HUNDERMELEGRAMS PER DAY MANY PEOPLE NOT ALL REPORT ELEVATED LEVELS OF LEBIDO ELEVATED SPERM PRODUCTION ELEVATED TESTOSTRON IN SOME CASES ELEVATED ESTROGEN A BUNCH OF HORMONE'S DOWN STREAM OF LUTINIZING HORMON NOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE A FIDOGIOGRASTUS RESPONDER OR A NONRESPONDER THERES SIMPLY NO WAY TO KNOW EXCEPT BY TRYING IT IF YOU ARE GOING TO GO DOWN THIS ROUT THEIRE TWO VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE LITERATURE ON THE FACT THAT FIDOGIAGRASTUS CAN BE TOXIC T O TESTICULAR CELLS AND PERHAPS OTHER CELLS WHEN TAKEN AT VERY HYGH DOSAGES SO OBEYING THE PARTICULAR DOSAGES OF FIDOGI AGRESTUS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED ON VARIOUS PRODUCT LABELS AND CYCLING FIDOGIA AGRETUS CAN BE IMPORTANT SOME PEOPLE NEED TO CYCLE IT EIGHT WEEKS ON TWO WEEKS OFF OTHER PEOPLE OFP FOR TWELVE WEEKS ON A MONTH OFF I KNOW A YOUFEOL WHO HAVE TAKEN IT CONTINUOUSLY WITH NO ISSUES BUT I DO WANT TO SUGGEST CAUTION WHEN TAKING FIDOGI AGRESTUS THE CAUTIONARY NOTES ARE STAY WITHIN THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE RANGES YOU CAN GO LOWER BUT CERTAINLY DON'T GO HIGHER AND I THINK IT IS WISE TO CYCLE EVERY EIGHT WEEKS OR SO TO COME OFF IT FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN GOING BACK ON IF THAT'S YOUR CHOICE IF YOU FEEL IT BENEFITED YOU WER TAKING IT FOR TWELVE WEEK PERIODS OF TIME AND THEN CYCLING OFF FOR FULL MONTH BEFORE REPEATING AGAIN THE BEST WAY TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT FIDOGIA OR ANY OF THESE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS IS IMPACTING YOUR HORMON LEVELS IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WANT AND NOT IMPACTING YOUR HORMON LEVELS OR OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR BIALGUASTHA YOU DON'T WANT IS FROM A BLOOD TEST THERE IS SIMPLY NO BETTER TOOL TO A VALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THESE SUPPLEMENTS ARE WORKING TO SUPPORT YOUR HORMONES IN THE WAYS THAT YOU WANT AND NOT CAUSING ISSUES EXCEPT TO TAKE A BLOOD TEST THIS PODCAST HAS INSIDE TRACTER AS A SPONSOR THAT CAN DO IN HOME BLOOD TASTS AND GIVE YOU BLOOD PANELS THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF BLOOD TESTS THAT ARE QUITE GOOD AS WELL OF COURSE AND IN THE FIRST EPISODE OF THE HUVEMAN LABPODCAST THAT I DID WITH DOCTOR CALGOLETT AGAIN A MEDICAL DOCTOR EXPERT IN HORMONES DIOBEDIS AND VERYUSOTHER ASPECTS OF MEDICINE HE DESCRIBED AND IT IS TIME STAMPED HOW TO STAND THE BEST PROBABILITY OF GETTING YOUR INSURANCE TO COVER A BLOOD TEST HOW TO TALK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT GETTING A HORMON PANEL AND SO ON S I'LL REFER YOU TO THAT EPISODE FOR THAT BUT BLOOD TESTS ARE GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT I RECOMMEND TAKING THEM BEFOR ADDING IN ANY SUPPLEMENT TO INCREASE HORMONES OF ANY KIND OR DECREESE ORMONES OF ANY KIND FOR THAT MATTER AND THEN AGAIN AFTER ABOUT FOR TO EIGHT WEEKS OF TAKING THAT PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVALUATE WHETHER NOT AT WORKED AND WHETHER NOT IT HAD ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO AVOID I ALSO WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THE DOSAGE CONVERSATION THA WE HAD EARLIER JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A RECOMMENDED DOSAGE OF FIDOGIA AGRESTUS OF SAY SIX HUNDRE MILIGRAMS PER DAY FIRST OF ALL THAT IS NOT AN INVITATION TO TAKE TWICE AS MUCH AND EXPECT TWICE THE PAUSIVE EFFECTS THAT IS NOT A GOOD APPROACH ESPECIALLY WITH SOMETHING LIKE FIDOGIA AGRESTUS WHICH CAN AT HYDOSAGES BE TOXIC BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO PERHAPS CONSIDER TAKING A LOWER DOSAGE AND SEING HOW THAT AFFECTS YOUR HORMONES THAT APPROACH REQUIRES A BIT MORE PATIENCE I KNOW MOST PEOPLE OR THING I WANT THE EFFECT AND I WANT IT NOW BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN THINKING ABOUT EXERCISE ONR NUTRITIAN OR SUPPLEMENTATION TO REALLY PLAY THE LONG GAME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO WORK FOR YOU IN THE IMMEDIATE END IN THE LONG TERM AND TO EASE INTO ANY KIND OF SUPPLEMENT REGIMENE FOR INSTANCE BY T AKING ONE THING AT A TIME VERYING ONE SUPPLEMENT OUT AN ONE SUPPLEMENT IN STARTING AT MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSE AND BUILD UP YOUR PROTOCALS OVER A YEAR OR SEVERAL YEARS IT REALLY CAN BE BENEFICIAL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF I STARTED EXPLORING THE SUPPLEMENT SPACE AND TAKING DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENTS IN DIFFERENT COMMINATION AND ALONE VALUATING WHICH ONE'S WORKED AND DID NOT WORK FOR ME  SOME WERE ABSOLLY DREADFUL FOR ME I AVE TONS OF STORIES ABOUT SUPPLEMENT FAILS SOME OF WHICH WERE JUST KIND OF INOCUOUS THE MEANTING THEY WERE WASTE O MONEY WHICH ISN'T ANOCUOUS BUT AT LEAST IT WAS IN DETRIMENTAL TO MY HEALTH OTHER SUPPLEMENTS WHICH FORTUNATELY DON'T EXIST ON THE ARKET ANY MORE A I THINK ACTUALLY A WERE QUITE DANGEROUS AND I FEEL LUCKY THAT I DID NOT EXPERIENCE EVEN GREATER NEGATIVE EFFECTS FROM THEM OTHER SUPPLEMENTS HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUSLY USEFUL FOR ME AN FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR THINGS LIKE SLEEP AND HORMONES SUPPORT FOCUS AND SO ON SO FIDOGIA AGRASSUS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A SUPPLEMENT THAT IS KNOWN TO HAVE POTENT EFFECTS BUT YOU NEED TO APPROACH IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE A I WOULD SAY RESPECT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DOSAGE RANGES IN WHICH IT WORKS A HAVE TO BE KEPT PRETTY NARROW WITHOUT CAUSING ISSUES IT DOES INCREASE LUTINIZING HORMONE AND THEREBY TESTOSTERON AN ESTROGEN SO IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHOS ALREADY EXCESSIVELY HIGH IN ONE OR THE OTHER IT'S GOING O BE VERY HARD TO JUST DIRECT IT TO ONLY TESTOSTRONER ONLY ESTROGEN NOW THE TOPIC OF TO DAY'S EPISODE IS NOT ABOUT FIDOGIA AGGRESSAS PER SAY I HIGHLIGT IT BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE MORE POTENT SUPPLEMENTS FORSAKE OF HORMON AUGMENTATION BUT IT'S STILL FAIRLY BROAD BAND IT'S A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC THEN SOMETHING LIKE SHILOGY BUT IT'S STILL FAIRLY BROAD BAND IN TERMS OF HITTING MULTIPLE AND POINT HORMONS TESTSTRON AN ESTROGEN AND MAY BE SOME OTHER HORMONES AS WELL THERE ARE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS IN PARTICULAR TONGOT ALI WHICH IS KNOWN TO FOR INSTANCE INCREASE LIBIDO WHETHER NOT IT DOES THAT BY WAY OF AUGMENTING DOPOMIN RELATED PATHWAYS OR TESTOSTERON PATHWAYS STILL IS 'N CLEAR IT IS KNOWN TO INCREASE FREE TESTOSTERON BY REDUCING SEXHORMONBINING GLOBULEN TONGAALI CAN BE BENEFICIAL BOTH FOR MEN AND FOR WOMEN IN DOSAGES ANYWHERE FROM TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY SO THERE I WOULD SAY SCALE ACCORDING TO BODY SIZE ALTHOUGH START WITH THE MINIMUM AMOUNT AND FIND THE MINMAL EFFECTIVE DOSE FOR YOU AGAIN BLOOD WORK IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DETERMIN WHAT'S WORKING ARE NOT WORKING AT THE LEVEL OF OBJECTIVE NUMBERS BUT SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE MATTERS TOO YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE IT AT FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS FOR FOUR WEEKS AND YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY EFFECT YOU MIGHT TRY T AT SIX HUNDR MILIGRAMS BUT NOT HIGHER AND IF YOU STILL DON'T SEE AN EFFECT WILL THEN  DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE WORKED FOR YOU OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCED DRAMATIC EFFECTS FROM THINGS LIKE FIDOGIA AND TONGAALI WHY WOULD THAT BE THE CASE WELL FYOU LOOK TO THE SCIENTIFIC LERSIURE WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE STUDIES THAT REPORT THE BIGGEST EFFECTS OF ANY SUPPLEMENT USUALLY START WITH A POPULATION THAT SOMEHOW DIMINISHED OR BACK ON ITS HEELS IN ONE PARTICULAR DIMENTION SO FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THAT ARE HYPOGANATL THAT ARE NOT MAKING ENOUGH TESTOSTRONE OR FREE TESTOSTRON INFACT OR LEVELS ARE VERY VERY LOW THEIR SUBCLINICAL OFF RANGE IN TERMS OF THE CHARKS BELOW THE NORMAL WELL THOSE PEOPLE WHEN THEY TAKE SUPPLEMENTS LIKE TONGA ALI FIDOGIA TEND TO EXPERIENCE GREATER EFFECTS BECAUSE THEIRE STARTING FROM A LOWER LEVEL THAN PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS ARE CLOSE TO THE OPTIMA LEVELS ACHIEVED THROUGH EITHER GE GENETICS EXERCISE NUTRITION OR SOME COMBINATION OF THOSE THET'S AN IMPORTAN THING TO THINK ABOUT THESE ARE CALLED FLOOR EFFECTS AND SEALING EFFECTS SEALING EFFECTS ARE FOR INSTANCE IF AN INDIVIDUAL ALREADY HAS VERY HIGH TESTASTRON AN FREE TESTASTRON AND THEY TAKE A SUPPLEMENT TO INCREASE IT FURTHER THEY MIGHT NOT SEE ANY INCREASE WHEREAS SOMEBODY WHO SITS MORE IN THE MIDDLE TO LOW RANGE STANDS TO EXPERIENCE OF MUCH GREATER INCREASE IN FACT ONE INDIVIDUAL I KNOW WHO TOOK TONGA ALI ADMITTEDLY ON MY RECOMMENDATION HIS TESTASTRON WAS INITIALLY VERY LOW AND HE WAS HAVING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS HE DID BLOOD WORK HE THAT'S HOW HE KNEW IT WAS LOW AND HE THEN TOOK TONGAALI AND FIDOGIA IN COMMINATION IS HE DECIDE HE JUST WANTED RESULTS THAT HE DIDN'T CARE WHICH WHAT WHICH THING WAS GOING TO GIVEN THE RESULTS ANHY EXPERIENCE BIG INCREASES IN TESTOSTRON THIS WOULD BE A NOT FREE BUT TOTAL TESTASTRON OF HE EXPERIENCE AS MUCH AS SIX HUNDRED NANIGRAMS PRODEST LEADER INCREASE FROM WHERE HE WAS BEFORE WHICH IS VERY DRAMATIC WAS A NEAR TRIPLING OF WHERE HIS A TESTOSTRON HAS STARTED OFF TO WHERE HE ENDED UP I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S EVER DONE THE EXPERIMENT OF REMOVING FIDOGIAR TONGOT TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE IT WAS AND THIS IS WHY MANY PEOPLE JUST TAKE THEM IN COMBINATION AND IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET FOR IT IN YOU ARE INTERESTING JUST FINDING WHAT WORKS BUT NOT ISOLATING WHAT WORKS AT THE LEVEL SINGLE INGREDIENTS THAT WOULD BE THE PROACH I RECOMMEND HOWEVER AGAIN I THINK MOST PEOPLL DO WELL TO FIGROUT WHICH SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS ARE GIN A WORK BEST FOR THEM BY ISOLATING THE VARIABLES THE WAY OF DESCRIBED REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE TO MY KNOWLEDGE TONGAALI DOES NOT NEED TO BE CYCLED MAY NEED ON'T HAVE TO TAKE PERIODS OF TIME OFF FROM IT ASHOULD NOTE THAT THE EFFECTS OF TONGAALI CAN TAKE A LOBIT LONGER TO EXPERIENCE SO PERHAPS BLOODWORK SHOULD BE DONE GHT TO TWELVE WEEKS AFTER INITIATING THE TONGA ALI PROTOCOL A SUPPOSED TO EARLIER AND IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE SORT OF CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ON LIBIDO AND THAT POINTS TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ITS HAVING SOMEIMPACKTD ON NURL PATHWAYS AS SUPPOSED TO HORMON PATHWA TORMON PATHWAYS CAN BE SLOW BUT IN GENERAL NURL PATHWAYS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO EXPLAIN SLOW RISEING SHIFTS IN ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ASPECT THAT THEN REMAIN STABLE OVER TIME SO THE EXACT EFFECTS OF TONGAALI AND WHERE MEANING WHERE THEY ARISE IN THE BRAINBODY AREN'T KNOWN I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO A REALLY BEAUTIFUL REVIEWARTICLE THAT COVERS THE LITERATURE ON TONGANALI THIS CAME OUT FAIRLY RECENTLY ANTHAT I AVE REVIEWED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER  EMDIES IN A MEDICAL ERE MEDICINE RELATED PODCASTERS IT'S A REALLY NICE REVIEW OR PROVIDELING TO THAT GIVES A SURVEY OF TONGALI WHAT PEOPLE ARE DISCOVERING WHAT THEYR FINDING WAT THE ARE NOT FINDING AND SO FORTH AS A FINAL NOTE ON SUPPLEMENTS FOR HORMON AUGMENTATION AND SUPPLEMENTATION ONE IT MAKE A BRIEF MENTION OF SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO FEMALE HEALTH WHICH IS OF COURSE THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ACROSS THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE DIFFEREN HORMONES AR PRESENT DFENT LEVELS FOLICAL STIMULA HORMONE IS VERY HIGH DURING THE SOCLE FALICULAR PHASE RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR LUDIAL PHASE WE HAVE AN ENTIRE EPISODE COMING UP ABOUT FEMALE HORMONES AND HORMON HEALTH THAT WILL COVER THIS WE ALSO COVERED A LOBIT OF THIS IN THE OTHER EPISODES ON O TUSTOSTRON AN ESTROGEN BUT THE POINT I LIKE TO MAKE NOW IS THAT FOR WOMEN THEY SHOULD FULLY EXPECT THAT CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS NOT ALL BUT CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY IMPACT DIFFERENT HORMONES WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT EFFACTS MAY BEVEN OPPOSITE EFFECTS AT DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND FOR THAT REASON I BELIEVE IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE TIGHT CONTROL OVER DOSAGE AND INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS IN YOUR SUPPLEMENT REGIMENT SO FOR INSTANCE OF YOUR SUMBODY WHO TAKE SHELOGI AND I KNOW MANY WOMEN WHO TAKE SHILOGY OR TONGA ALI FOR INSTANCE OR MACA AND YOU FIND THAT IT REALLY SERVES YOU WELL THAT IS IT PROVIDES THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS THAT YOU WANT AN ENJOY AT CERTAIN PHASES OF YOUR MENSTRUAL CYCLE BUT AT OTHER PHASES OF YOUR MENSTRUAL CYCLE IT FEELS LIKE TOO MUCH OR IT ACTUALLY CONSTRUCT TO GIVE YOU NEGATIVE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL EFFECTS WILL THEN OBVIOUSLY HAVING CONTROL OVER THOSE SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO THAT YOU CAN TITRATE THE DOSAGE OR INCREASE THE DOSAGE AS THE CASE MAY BE OR CEASE TAKING THOSE THINGS ENTIRELY AT CERTAIN PHASES OF YOUR MENSTRUAL CYCLE LET'S NOT SAY THAT SOME WOMEN CAN'T JUST CONTINUOUSLY TAKE THESE SUPPLEMENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCL SOME CAN BUT SOME FIND THAT THAT MAKES THEM VERY UN COMFORTABLE OR THAT THEY WOULD DO WELL TO ALTER DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS THE IFERENT PHASES OF THEIR CYCLE SO AGAIND THE SPEAKS TO THE CRITICAL IMPORTANTS OF SINGLE INGREDIENT CONTROL DOSAGE CONTROL AND THE ABILITY TO CEASE TAKING INDIVIDUAL OR MULTIBLE INGREDIENTS ACCORDING TO THE BACKDROP OF YOUR HEALTH GENERALLY AND OBVIOUSLY THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS A PROFOUND SHIFT IN THE HORMON AND THUS THE ENTIREBOBIOLOGICAL IND CYCHOLOGICAL MLU THAT EXIST IN THE BODY AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE ISSUE OF BIRTH CONTROL AND WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE TAKING HORMON BASEBIRTH CONTROL CERTAIN FORMS OF HORMONBATES BIRTH CONTROL AND WOMEN INVOLVE TONICALLY ELEVATING THAT MEANS CONSISTENTLY ELEVATING ESTROGEN THAT CERTAINLY GOING TO REDUCE THE FLUCTUATIONS AND THUS THE PROBABILITY THAT CERTAIN HORMNS AND HORMON PATHWAYS WILL CHANGE ACROSS THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE BUT NOT ELIMINATE ALTOGETHER ALSO THERE'S THE KEY ISSUE OF FERTILITY IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES ONE IMPORTANT NOTE EVEN TOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EPISODE ABOUT FERTILITY WERE CAN TO HAVE ONE SOON BUT THE IMPORTNT POINT ABOUT FERTILITY IS THAT THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS NOT JUST SHELOGY BUT THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENT PROTOCALS SUCH AS AL CARNATINE AND PARTICULAR INJECTABLE EL CARNATINE WHICH DOES REQUIRE PRESCRIPTION AT LEAST IN THE UESBUT ALSO ORLY INGESTEDEL CARNATINE THAT CAN IMPROVE SPERM HEALTH AND MOTILITY AND G HEALTHON MOTILITY I MENTIONED THAT EARLIER BUT IF COUPLES ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT IS A SUPPLEMENT DIRECTED TOWARD SPIRM AND OR EGG HEALTH THAT YOU ALSO CONSIDER HOW THAT INTERFASES WITH SOME OF THE OTHER HORMON BASE COMPOUNDS THAT IS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT YOU MAY BE TAKING THIS IS TRUE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IVIAF IN BE TROFERALIZATION OR NOT AGAIN THAT ENTIRE DISCUSSION WILL BE HANDLED IN OUR EPISODE ON FERTILITY AND ON FEMALE HORMON HEALTH AND WE ALREADY DID THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR CALGULET ON MAL HORMON HEALTH OPTIMIZATION THE NEXT CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTATION THAT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS IS SUPPLEMENTS RELATED TO COGNITIVE AND HANCEMENT AND FOCUS AND HERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY USEFUL STRATEGIES THAT ONE COULD TAKE I LIKE TO DIVIDE THIS CONVERSATION INTO TO GENERAL ATEGORIES OF SUPPLEMENTS TO ADDRESS COGNATE OF ENHANCEMENT IN FOCUS THE FIRST CATEGORY ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT INCREASE ENERGY BY WAY OF STIMULENT PROPERTIES SO THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THESE IS KAFFINE KAFFINE IS OF COURSE A MOLECULE THAT CAN INCREASE LEVELS OF ALERTNESS IT ALSO CAN INCREASE LEVELS OF FOCUS PROVIDED THAT DOSAGES ARE IN THE APPROPRIATE RANGE THE APPROPRIATE RANGE IN MOST CASES GOING TO BE ONE TO THREE MELEGRAMS POR KILEGRAMA BODYWEIGHT TAKE IN THIRTY MINUTES OR SO BEFORE ANY KIND OF MENTAL OR PHYS ICAL ENDEAVOR WE DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT KAFFNE WHERE YOU CAN LEARN LOTS OF FACTS ABOUT KAFFINE HOW BEST TO UTILIZE KAFFNE AND INDEED I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A FEW OF THOSE NOW TURNS OUT THAT IF YOUR REGULAR KAFFINE USER YOU CAN STILL DERIVE THE COGNITIVE ENHANCING AND FOCUS ENHANCING EFFECTS OF KAFFINE IF YOU INJEST KAFFINE EVERY DAY BUT IF YOU WERE TO TAKE TWO DAYS OFF FROM KAFFINE COMPLETELY AND RIGHT NOW I HEAR ALL THE KAFFINATICS OUT THERE O JUST KONT OF CRINGING AT THE IDEA AND THEN TAKE KAFFINE IN THE THIRTY MINUTES PRIOR TO SOME ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT EVENT PHYSICAL OR MENTAL EVENT WERE REALLY NEED TOF FOCUS AND BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THAT FOCUS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IT WOULD HAVE AN EVEN GREATER EFFECT THAN IT NORMALLY WOULD BUT SINCE MOST PEOPLE ARE TAKING KAFFINE IN A KIND OF ON GOING REGULAR WAY I JUST ONE EMPHASIZE THAT IT STILL HAS PRO COGNITIVE AND PRO FOCUS AF FACTS EVEN OF ITS TAKEN EVERY DAY OR EVEN MULTIPLE TIMES PERDAY AGAIN A CAUTIONARY NOTE DON'T DRIN KAFINE TOO LATE IN THE DAY PAST TWO PIMAC AN REALLY START TO IMPEDE A YOUR SLEEP AT NIGHT EVEN IF YOU CAN FALL SLEEP AT NIGHT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THAT SLEEP IS NOT GOING TO BE GREAT IF YOUR INJESTING KAFFINE IN THE PRECEDING EIGHT TO TEN AND EVEN TWELVE HOURS AND THAT ACTUALLY RAISES ANOTHER TEN GENTIAL BUT STILL IMPORTANT POINTS I'M GOING TO MAKE IT N THEN GET BACK TO SUPPLEMENTS WHICH IS THE BEST COGNATIVE AN HANCER THAT YOU WILL EVER TAKE IS A REALLY GOOD NIGHT SLEEP OF SUFFICIENT DURATION O KA SO SLEEP IS GOING TO BE THE BETEROCH OF YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND REMEMBER THINGS IN FACT ITS DURING SLEEP THAT NERAL CONNECTIONS REMODEL SO COLD NERRO PLASTICITY SASIALLY NOT WHEN YOU TRI YOUR LEARNING BUT IT'S WHEN YOU CONSOLIDATE AND REINFORCE LEARNING AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT RELATE TO COGNIVIN HANCEMENT IN FOCUS YOUR THING OF COURSE IS THAT YOUR GOING TO NEED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF NEUTRITION YOU DON'T WANT TO BE OVERLY HUNGRY OR IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO FOCUS NOR DO YOU WANT TO BE OVERLOADED WITH KALORIES OR A VOLUME OF FOOD OR HAVE YOUR BLOOD LUCOS TO BE SO HIGH THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU SLEEPY THERE'S A REASON WHY WHEN DISCUSSING STRAS AND THE SO CALLED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THE PHRASE REST AND DIGEST COMES INTO PLAY REST AND DIGEST AS THE NAME IMPLIES RELATES TO THE FACK THAT WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF FOOD IN ARE GOT IT TENDS TO MAKE US SLEEPY IN OTHER WORDS IT S HARD FOR US TO FOCUS AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO MAINTAIN COGNIVITTENTION AND REMEMBER THINGS ET CETERA SO THERE BUNCH OF BEHAVIOURABLE TOOLS FOR ENHANCING FOCUS DID ENTIRE EPISODE ON ENHANCING FOCUS IT DOES TOUCH ON SUPPLEMENTATION AGAIN YAN FIND LINXS TO THAT IN ALL FORMATS AT HUBERAN LABDAT CAM WE ALSO HAVE A NEWS LETTER RELATED TO THIS TOPIC ALSO AT UBERMAN LABDACOM AT ZERO COST WITH ALL OF THAT SAID AND IN PARTICULAR THE HIGHLIGHT ABOUT SLEEP BEING THE BEST WAY TO ENHANCE YOUR COGNIVE ABILITIES AND FOCUS ANY TIME ERE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS FOR ENHANCING COGNIVABILITY IN FOCUS A MAJOR KATEGORY OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTS IS GOING TO FALL IN TO THE STIMULANT KATEGORY AND THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE MOST OFTEN KAFFINE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF STIMULANTS NOCK IN A TOUCH ON THOSE FOR THE MOMENT JUST TALK ABOUT KAFFINE WHEN PEOPLE HEAR KAFFINE THEY THINK A WHILE I CAN JUST DRINK COFFEINE INDEED THAT'S A GREAT SOURCE OF KAFFINE SO AS YERBAMATE I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE TO AM IF YOU NUSE YOUR BAMATE FOR WHATEVER PURPOS KAFFINE OR OTHERWISE THAT YOU AVOID THE SMOKED VERSIONS OF YEURBOMATE AM THE ARE CARSONAGENIC THAT IS THE SMOKED VERSIONS OR CARCONAGENIC AN  AND TO I CONSUME THE NON SMOKED A VARIETIES AM INSTEAD THE IMPORTANTING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT KAFFINE IS THAT WHILE IT CAN BE INGESTED IN THE FORM OF A DRINK OR AN ENERGY DRINK TO YOUR COFFEE IT CAN ALSO BE INGESTED AS A PURE SUPPLEMENT THAT IS THER ARE KAFFINE SUPPLEMENTS AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE INCLUDING A VERY VERY PROMINENT POD KASTER WHOSE NAME I WON'T MENTION WHO DRINKS ERBALTEA BUT TAKES A ONE HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED MELIGRAM TABLET OF KAFFIN WITH THE ERBALTY SO IN THAT CASE IT IS NO LONGER ERBALTY IT IS KAFFINATED ERBALTY WHEN YOU TAKE KAFFINE IN PILL FORM IT TENDS TO HAVE A MUCH MORE POTENT AND LONG LASTING EFFECT THAN WHEN YOU TAKE KAFFINE IN THE FORM OF COFFEE OR TEA IT'S ACTUALLY A WORLD APART IN TERMS OF IT'S EFFECTS AND IF YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIENCE THIS BEFORE I IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO EXPLORE IT MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHNG YOU WANT TO EXPLORE IN PARTICULAR YOUR SOMEBODY WHO EXPERIENCES ANXIETY OR PANIC ATTACKS BE VERY CAREFUL WITH YOUR IN TAKE OF KAFFINE AGAIN SEE THE EPISODE OF THE HUBERMAN LAPAKAS ALL ABOUT KAFFINE FOR MORE ON THAT BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT EVEN HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF KAFIN IN TABLET FORM I SUPOSE IT COULD BE IN CASIL FORMAS WELL BUT IN ITS PURE FORM LEADS TO MUCH GREATER ENHANCEMENT OF ALERTNESS AND FOCUS THEN DOES OFTEN THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT OR EVEN TWICE THE AMOUNT OF CAFINE CONTAINED IN COFFEE OR T NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN COFFEE AND T SO HERE I'M NOT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO BECOME RELIANT ON KAFINE CAPSULS OR ON CAIN TABLETS BUT IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE ALERTNES AND FOCUS KAFINE IS A POTENT WAY TO DO THAT IT WORKS THE OTHER CATEGORY OF STIMULANT THAT CAN WORK IN TERMS OF ENHANCING ALERTNESS IN FOCUS ARE GOING TO BE THINGS THAT INCREASE A DERENOLAN IN SOME OTHER WAY OR EPINEFERAN AS IT ALSO CALLE THE DENLAN EPIN EFERENT SAME THING IN SOME OTHER WAY THAT ARE GOING TO TUCHIN TO OR AGMENT THE SO CALLED ADRONERGIC AND ADRENALAN SYSTEMS AND THERE ARE THINGS LIKE YO HIMBINE AND DIFFERENT FORMS OF YOHIMBINE LIKE ALFAOHIMBINE OM THEIR MULTIPLE FORMS OF THESE THINGS NOW I WOULD GO TO EXAMINED OT CALM TO EXPLORE THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF OHIMBINE ABOUT TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO YOHIMBINE WAS MARKETOD PRIMARILY AS A PROLIBIDO AND PRO ERECTAL AGENT TURNS OUT IT HAS VERY LOW EFFICACY FOR BOTH OF THOSE THINGS BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN FORMS OF YOHIMBINE THAT ACT AS STIMULENTS THAT AR EFFECTIVE AND ARE SEPARATE FROM THOSE CLAIMS AND PATHWAYS ONE PARTICULAR FORM IS CALLED ALFA YOHIMBINE IT SOMETIMES GOES BY THE NAME RAWOLSIN AND THAT SPELLED AR A U U O L E C I AN E AGAIN THAT ALFAYOHIMBNE AND IT'S USED AS A STIMULANT OFTEN TO ALSO PROMOTE FATLOSS AND ALERTNESS HAVE TO SAY THAT IT'S A VERY POTENT AN SOMEWHAT AM PRECARIUS SUPPLEMENT SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A LOT OF ANXIETY ON IT THAT COULD ALSO BE BECAUSE THEY TEND TO TAKE IT AM ON EITHER AN EMPTY STOMACH OR IN COMMINATION WITH SUBCOLORIC DIETS IT'S A IT SORT OF GETTING OUT ON THE EDGE OF THINGS THAT O FOR SOME PEOPLE CAN WORK NOT SO WELL FOR OTHER PEOPLE AM THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY FIND IT TO BE A VERY EFFECTIVE STIMULANT IN GENERAL IN TERMS OF SUPPLEMENT BASED APPROACHES TO INCREASE COGNATIVE FUNCTION AND FOCUS KAFFIN EITHER IN COFFEE OR T FORM OR IN TABLET OR CAPSIL FORM BUT AT LOWER DOSAGES THAN YOU WOULD FIND IN CCOFFEEAN T I THINK HIS ACTUALYA REASONABLE WAY TO EXPLORE STIMULANT BASED APPROACHES RENHANCING COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND FOCUS I MENTION ALL THAT NOT BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU PROBABLY ALREADY DIDN'T KNOW THAT KAFFIN CAN ENHANCE ALERTNESS AND FOCUS MOST PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW THAT AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUT RATHER AS A CONTRAST POINT FOR THE OTHER SUPPLEMENT BASED APPROACH FOR INCREASING COGNA FUNCTION AND FOCUS WHICH IS TO INCREASE CERTAIN NARROW TRANSMITTER PATHWAYS THAT ARE NOT STIMULANT BASED SO FOR INSTANCES ALFAG P C WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A COLINE DONER ACIN THE PAHWAYS RELATE TO THE NEURMODULATOR A CEETAL COLING AND CAN ENHANCE FOCUS SO A DOSAGES OF ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF FOCUS FOR SAKE OF MENTAL WORK OR PHYSICAL WORK THE HALF LIFE OF ALPHAG P C IS ABOUT FOR TO SIX HOURS SO ITS RELATIVELY SHORT LASTING ALTHOUGH YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO TAKE IT RIGHT BEFORE BED I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT IT IS NOT A STIMULANT IT TENDS TO ENHANCE FOCUS BY AUGMENTING A SETO COLING AND A SEATO COALING PATHWAYS SPECIFICALLY NOW IT DOES CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF AN INCREASE IN ALERTNESS SO SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY PERCEIVE IT SUBJECTIVELY AS AN INCREASE IN OVERALL STIMULATION BUT IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A KAFINE TYPE STIMULANT SO FOR INSTANCE THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO SIX UNDR MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C TAKEIN ALONE WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE MORE FOCUS BUT DOES INTEND TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GITTERY OR OVER STIMULATED SIMILARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEENE OF SOMETHING LIKE AL TYROSINE WHICH IS AN MENOACID PRECURSOR TO DOPOMINE A DIFFERENT NEUROMODULATOR TAKEN ALONE OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH AGAIN I BELIEVE IN SEPARATING THESE THINGS OUT BY PRODUCT BUT YOU SUPOSE YOU COULD TAKE ALPHAG P C AND ALTIRACINE TOGETHER IF YOU HAD ALREADY TRY THEM SEPARATELY INE DECIDE THEY WORKED WELL FOR YOU THEY DECIDED COMBINE THEM WHAT PEOPLE TEND TO EXPERIENCES THAT THE COLINERGIC STIMULATION FROM ALPHAGY P C AND THE DOPOMENERGIC STIMULATION FROM ALL TIRASINE OR SIMPLY ALTYROSINE ALONE OR ALPHAGY P C ALONE LEADS TO INCREASE LEVELS OF FOCUS WITHOUT THE CON OF OVERALL FEELINGS OF STIMULANT BASED ALERTNESS THAT ONE WOULD EXPERIENCE WITH KAFINE AND INDEED OR I SHOULD SAY OF COURSE THERE ARE PRODUCTS OUT THERE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT COMBINE ALL THREE OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER KAFNED ALPHAG P C AND ALTIRASINE A AND WHILE I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT'S A GOOD OR A BAD THING I WOULD SUGGESTS THAT ANY TIME YOU START TO EXPLORE THE COGNATIVE ENHANCING EFFECTS AND THE FOCS INHANCING EFFECTS OF ANY SUPPLEMENT THAT YOU ASK WHICH ONES ARE STIMULANT SOFERENC AS KAFINE AND ALPHA HIMBIANE WHICH ONES TEND TO TAP MOREINTON REMODULATOR SYSTEMS LIKE ALPHAG P C AND ALTIRASINE AND TO SEPARATE THOSE OUT CONCEPTIALLY BECAUSE WHEREAS THINGS LIKE ALPA O HIMBIN ING KAFINE WILL MOSTLY SERVE THE ROLL OF INCREASING LEVELS OF ALERTNESS BUT NOT TIGHTENING YOUR FOCUS THINGS LIKE ALPHAGY P C AND ALTIRASINE TEND TO SERVE THE ROLL OF LESS ELEVATION AND ALERTNESS BUT MORE TIGHTENING OF FOCUS AND THIS OF COURSE IS WHY PEOPLE OFTEN STACK THESE AND TAKE THEM IN COMMINATION SBUT THING IT'S O VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION THAT MOST PEOPLE AREN'T AWARE OF AND I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE STIMULANT BASED APPROACH OR THE NERMODULATOR BASED APPROACH IS BETTER OR WORSE THEY ARE SIMPLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE THEM SEPARATELY IF INDEED YOUREGONG TO EXPLORE ANY OF THEM BE FOR YOU WOULD START TO COMBINE THEM IN A SINGLE FORMULA AGAIND INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS ORE GOINGTO BE THE WAY TO GO INTERMS A FIGURING OUT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU IF ANYTHING SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND THAT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF CAFINE OR EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF ALPHAG P C RAL TIRACINE JUST PLACES THEM INTO A STATE OF MIND AND OR BODY THAT JUST UNCOMFORTABLE AND NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE KIND OF WORK THAT THEY WANT TO DO WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE SUR TO MYSELF REGULARLY RELY ON TAKING THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C IT TURNS OUT MORE THAN THAT CAND OF DOESN'T WORK FOR ME OR OR IT TENDS TO SEND MY MINE DOWN A PATHWAY THAT I DON'T LIKE TO BE IN FOR A SAKE OF COGNVE WORK BUT I WILL ROUTINELY TAKE THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C PRIOR TO SOME COGNIVE WORK OR PRIOR TO A WORK OUT I DO OFTEN COMBINE THAT WITH SOME CAFINE NOT IN CAPSIL OR PIL FORM BUT RATHER IN THE FORM OF CUP OF COFFEE OR YOUR BOMATE AND IT TURNS OUT THAT FOR ME JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ELTIRASINE O SOMETHING THAT WORKS VERY POWERFULLY TO ELEVATE MY LEVEL OF FOCUS BUT THAT I TEND TO CRASH PRETTY HARD AFTERWARD AND SO I TEND TO AIR AWAY FROM ELTIRASENE BUT SOME PEOPLE TOLERATE IT REALLY WELL AND ACTUALY REALLY LIKE IT I RELY ON SOMETHING ELSE FOR DOPOMIANE AUGMENTATION WHICH IS ON FENALE EPHILAMING WHICH I THE LOBIT MORE SHORT LASTING AGAIN I ARRIVED AT THESE PROTOCOLS FOR MYSELF BY MIXING IN MATCHING BUT MOSTLY BYU TRYING INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS ALONE BEFORE BINING THEM INTO ANY IN A SORT OF COCKTAIL BEFORE TAKING THEM BEFORE A WORK OUT OR BEFORE A COGNATIVE WORK BOUT AND I SUGGEST THAT YOU EXPLORE THEM IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO DELIVER YOU TO THE BEST POSSIBLE PROTOCALS FOR YOU WHICH ONLY YOU CAN DETERMINE AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN SUPPORT COGNATIVE FUNCTION AND FOCUS BUT THAT ALSO TOUCH ON OTHER GENERAL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO BRAIN AND BODY HEALF SUCH AS METABOLIC HEALTH MOOD ET CETERA AND THE ONE THAT COMES TO MIND HERE ARE THE OMEGA THREE FATIACIDS I'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT A MAGA THREE FADIACIDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF FOODS THOU FOR INSTANCE FATIOCIAN FISH ON THEIR CERTAIN PLANT BASE SOURCES FOR THESE AS WELL TERN ALGIES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT TOUCHE ON THIS IN THE EPISODES ON DEPRESSION THAT I'VE DONE BUT THIS TOPIC MAINLY COMES UP AROUND THE ISSUE OF FISH OIL FISH OIL CAPSILS AND LIQUID AND THIS IS A DISCUSSION I THINK IS WORTH HAVING EARLY ON IN THE EPISODE WE TALK ABOUT FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTS THAT INCLUDE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS WE TOUCH ON THE IDEA THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE THE BUTGET TO TAKE ONE SUCH A PRODUCT OR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT COMBINE ALL THOSE INGREDIENTS I SHOULD SAY THAT FOR THOSE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING A SUPPLEMENT BUT HAVE A LOWER BUDGET THAN WOULD ALLOW FOR TAKING ONE OF THOSE A GENERAL CATEGORIES OF OF SUPPLEMENTS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER FOR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION THAT COMBINES EVERYTHING VITEMENTS MINERALS PROBATICS PRUBATICS ABDAPTUGENS DIGESTIVE ENDS ON S I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN GREATLY ENHANCE THE PROBABILITY OF OFFSETTING DEPRESSION AND MAYBE EVEN IMPROVE MOOD DIRECTLY R INDIRECTLY THEREIS EVIDENCE FOR WHAT AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND OR OFFSET THE AMOUNT OF INTON TO PRESENT MEDICATION THE PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE THAT ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATED AND IMPROVE METABOLIC FUNCTION PARTY OF ASCULAR FUNCTION AND ALSO INHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DO FOCUST WORK AND HERE I'M REFERRING TO THE SO CALED AMEGA THREE ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS AN PRORTUE THE OMEGA THREE FORM OF THE ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS THERE'S NOW A LOT OF DATA SHOWING THAT INJESTING ONE TO THREE GRAHMS OF E P A IN PARTICULAR IN THE FORM OF EITHER FISIA OL CAPSLES OR LIQUID CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH AND CAN ENHANCE FOCUS AND COGNAIVABILITY THIS IS A SPECIALLY TRUE IN DEVELOPING BRAINS AND THEREIS ACTUALLY AN EXTENSIVE DATE OUT OF A LABORATORY UNIVERSY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA TALKING ABOUT HOW MOTHERS WHO SUPPLEMENT OMAGA THREE IS IN PARTICULAR THE E P AS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO NEED TO GET THE D A CHS THAT LEADS TO GREATER BRAINWEIGHTS AND HEALTH OF OFFSPRING IS SOMETHING WEILL DEFLY EXPLORE IN IF YOUTURE EPISODE LIKELY WITH AN EXPERT GUEST WHOS DOING THAT WORK IN THAT LABORATORY AT YOU C SANTABARBARA THE POINT HERE IS THAT IF SOMEBODY HAS A LIMITED BUDGET TO PURCHASE SUPPLEMENTS AND CANNOT AFFORD A FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENT AND THE SORT THAT WE TALKE ABOUT EARLIER ATHLETIC GREENS OR SIMILAR BUT THEY DO HAVE A BUDGET THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PURCHASE A HIGH QUALITY OMEGA THREE FATIACID FICIAL THAT AND TO INJEST IT IN QUANTITY SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO GET ABOVE THAT ONE GRAM OF E P A PER DAY AGAIN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRODUCT LABELS YOULL OFTEN SEE YOU KNOW FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR SIXTEEN HUNDRED A MILIGRAMS OF ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS BUT THE KEY IS YOU GET ABOVE THAT ONE GRAM OF E P A PER DAY THRESHALD THAN AS HIGHEST THREE GRAMS PER DAY WE HAD A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST DOCTOR RONDO PATRIC WHO TAKES ANYWHERE FROM I BELIEVE THREED OF FOUR MAYBE VEN MORE GRAHAMS OF E P A PER DAY FOR VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING SOME OF THE REASONS WERE DISCUSSING NOW BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO DISCUSSING SOME OF THE MORE GLOBAL THENES RELATED TO DEVELOPING A RATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCALL I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON THIS VAST CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTATION THAT INCLUDES FOOD BASED OR FOOD MIMIC TYPE SUPPLEMENTS SO THIS WOULD BE FOR INSTANCE WAY PROTINES A OR MILK PROTINES OR EGPROTINESE OR PLANT PROTINES THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT IN AN OF ITSELF DESERVES AN ENTIRE EPISODE IF YOU WANT UNDERSTAND WHICH TYPES OF PROTINE AND SOURCE OF PROTINES ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST BIAVAILABLE THE BEST FOR PROTINE SYNTHESIS FOR RECOVERY FROM EXERCISE BUILDING MUSCLE ET CETERA I'D LIKE TO REFER YOU TO A SEGMENT WITHIN THE EPISODE THA DID WITH DOCTOR LANE NORTON WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT TOTAL PROTINE NEEDS PER DAY IT'S A BOUT ONE GRAHAM PER POUND OF BODYWEIGHT PER DAY FOR MOST PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THERE SOME VARIATION DEPENDING ON ACTIVITY ET CETERA AND THE QUALITY OF SOURCING OF THOSE VARIOUS PROTINES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT OF COURSE LEADS TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE QUALITY AND TYPE OF PROTINE THAT WOULD  PRESENT IN A SUPPLEMENT LIKE A WAY PROTINE SUPPLEMENT ARE CASINE WHICH IS A MILK PROTINE BASE SUPPLEMENT THAT DISCUSSION IS SEGMENTED IN TIMESTAMPED IN THE EPISODE HI DO WITH THEM YOU CAN FINATE HUBERMEN LABDOT COM THE ASHY POINTED TO SOME INTERESTING DATA ON POTATO PROTINE AS PERHAPS BEING A GREAT PLANT BASE SUBSTITUTE FOR THOSE THAT DON'T WANT TO TAKE WAYBASE PROTINE BUT THE FACT THAT WAYBASE PROTINES CAN BE VERY USEFUL FOR GETTING TOO AND ABOVE A PROTINE THRESHOLD FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS NOT JUST REMUSCLE BUILDING ALTHOUGH IT'S GREAT FOR THAT BUT FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL AND THAT'S BUT ONE CATEGORY OF FOOD BASED OR FOOD MIMIC TYPE SUPPLEMENTS THERE ARE FOR INSTANCE BRANCH CHINAMENO ACIDS THERE ARE FOR INSTANCE GREEN TEA SUPPLEMENTS THERE IS A HUGE LANDSCAPE OF THIS FAR TOO MUCH FOR US TO GET INTO IN ANY KIND OF  REASONABLE DETAIL BUT I DO ON ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THOSE ALL EXIST THE KEYTHING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WHILE THEY CAN SERVE A GREAT ROLL IN PROVIDING REPLACEMENT FOR MEALS THAT YOU PERHAPS COULDN'T HAVE CONSUMED OTHERWISE AND WHILE THEY OFTEN ARE VERY CONVENIENT BECAUE YOU CAN DRINK AS SUPPOSE TO EAT YOUR CALLERIES I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT GETTING SOME SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF UNUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS IS GOING TO BE USEFUL FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS IN PARTICULAR THE FIBRE THAT COMES ALONG WITH IT THE BULK OF THE FOOD THAT TENDS TO MAKE US FEEL SATED AND OF COURSE AM THE FACT THAT A LOT OF VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE CONTAINED WITHIN FOODS AS WELL AS ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS IN FOODS LIKE ANIMAL BASE PROTINES ARE NOT GOING TO BE PRESIDTS IN MOST IF NOT ALL OF THOSE CAN A FOOD MIMIC TYPE POWDERS AND REPLASEMENTS FOR FOOD ANOTHER POINT IS THIS QRUESSION ABOUT AGE RELATED EFFECTS SO FOR INSTANCE SHOULD KIDS BE TAKING SUPPLEMENTS WELL I MENTIONE EARLIER THAT THERE SOME EVIDENCE THAT MAKING SURE THAT KIDS ARE GETTING ENOUGH O MAGA THREE FATIACIDS CAN BE BENEFICIAL THEY CERTAINLY COULD GET THOSE FROM FOOD BASE SOURCES JUST LOOK UP ON LINE FOOD BASE SOURCES OF A MEGOTHRE FADIACIDS AND EPAS AND YOU'LL SEE LISTS THERE SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE TO SUPPLEMENT ON TOP OF THAT A IN PARTICULAR IN KIDS THAT ARE DEVELOPING VERY QUICKLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEIR CONSUMING ENOUGH EPAS FROM FOOD SOME PARENTS CHOOSE TO SUPPLEMENT ON TOP OF THAT I AM PERSONALLY NOT A FAN OF CHILDREN TAKING MELATONAN FOR THE REASON THAT MELETONE IS ALREADY CHRONICALLY ELEVATED IN KIDS AND TEREIS A GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE THAT MELETONE AND SUPPLEMENTATION IN KIDS CAN BE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL I DO'T WANT A CREATE ALARM AMONG THOSE WHO ALREADY BEEN TAKING IT OR GIVING IT TO THEIR KIDS OR THAT GAVE IT TO THEIR KIDS IN THE PASS BUT I DO THINK THAT MELETONA IN PARTICULAR SHOULD BE APPROACHED WITH A LOT OF CAUTION ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE ISSUE OF WHETHER NOT ALL THESE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSE WHETHER OR NOT KIDS CAN TAKE THEM SAFELY AND AGAIN IT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL I WOULD SAY Y THAT FOR THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT RELATE TO HORMON AUGMENTATION AND SUPPORT UNLESS YOUR PHYSICIAN ABORD CERTIFIED EMDY SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDS THEM I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST AVOIDING INTAKE OF THOSE THINGS UNTIL AT LEAST AFTER PUBERTY AND PROBABLY IN TO THE LATEENS AND EARLY TWENTIES BECAUSE THE BODY AND BRAIN ARE STILL DEVELOPING AND HORMONE SYSTEMS ARE STILL ACTIVE EVEN THOUGH PUBERTY MAY HAPPEN BETWEEN AGES YOU KNOW ELEVEN IN FOURTEEN OR EVEN FIFTEEN PUBERITY CAN BE A LONG LASTING EVENT WITH A LONG TAPER AND TAIL ON IT SO YOU WONTO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT AM AUGMENTING HORMONES AM IN YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTATION UNLESS A PHYSICION IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH YOU OR RATHER YOU WITH THEM AND THEN IN AGES OF SAY TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD TWENTY FOUR AND OLDER I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR FIFTIES OR SIXTIES WOULD HAVE ANY DIFFERENT PROTOCALLS THAN PEOPLE IN THEIR THIRTIES AND FORTIES EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE DOMAIN OF COGNATIVE ENHANCEMENT WHERE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE AGAIND MIGHT PROVIDED IT CAN BE DONE SAFELY AND WITH THE CONSULT OF A PHYSICIAN IT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE APPROACHING THEIR LATER YEARS TO CONSIDER INCREASING DOSAGES OR THE VARIETY OF THINGS AND APPROACHES THAT THEY TAKE FOR COGNAIVE ENHANCEMENT BECAUSE AGE RELAD COGNITIVE DECLINE IS A REALITY THERE IS NO PERSON THAT ESCAPES THAT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER NOT THE SLOPE OF THAT DECLINE IS VERY STEEP OR VERY SHALLOW AND OF COURSE HIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO RAISE THE POINT THAT I MADE MUCH EARLIER AND THAT I'LL MAKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE IT REALLY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT TO TO DAYS DISCUSSION WHICH IS THAT BEHAVIOURS BOTH EXERCISE SLEEP MAKING SURE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO LIGHT GETTING SUFFICIENT SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY IF YOU CAN AND LIMITING YOUR VIEWING OF BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IN THE LATE EVENING AND E SPECIALLY BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN PM AN FOR AAM THINGS OF THAT SORT ALL THE DUEWS AND DON'TS AND OF COURSE CARDVASCULAR EXERCISE AND RESISTANCE TRAINING EXERCISE AND MAY BEVE FLEXIBILITY TRAINING EXERCISE TOPICS WEVE COVERED EXTENSIVELY ON THIS PODCAST AND FOR WHICH WE'LL SOON HAVE A SPECIAL SERIES ERRING WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALPIN THAT GETS INTO A LOT OF DETAIL AND PROTOCAL DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU CAN ALL EMPLOY ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AT EVERY AGE CERTAINLY PASSPUBERTY IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE CARTY OF ASCULAR FUNCTION IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE FOCUS AND EVERY ASPECT THAT WE REALLY ALL STAND TO AND WANT TO ENHANCE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION SO AGAIN GET YOUR SLEEP RIGHT DO THAT BY GETTNG YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO LIGHT RIGHT GET YOUR EXERCISE RIGHT QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION RIGHT AND THEN OFCORSERS THAT LANDSCAPE OF NUTRITION THT WE TALKED ABOUT EXTENSIVELY EARLIER IN FOR WHICH WE HAVE OTHER EPISODES THAT REALLY DIVE DEEP INCLUDING THAT EPISODE OR I SHOULD SAY IN PARTICULAR THAT EPISODE WITH DOCTOR LANE NORTON WHERE WE REALLY TOOK A FULL SURVEY OF THE LANDSCAPE OF NUTRITION EVERYTHING FROM PROTENE NEEDS VIDEMEN'S MINERALS FIBERE MICROBIOMITS A DEEP DEEP DISCUSSION WITH A L OT OF ACTION WILL TAKE AWAYS IF YOUARE CURIOUS ABOUT NUTRITION AND IN PARTICULAR FO YOUR A VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN OR CARNIVORE BASE BUT EVEN FOR THE MORE COMMON OMNIVORES SUCH AS MYSELF I FOUND THAT TO BE AN INCREDIBLE LEARNING JOURNEY THANKS TO DOCTOR LANE NORTON TO SO MUCH ON USEFUL KNOWLEDGE IN THAT EPISODE IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT NUTRITION THE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THE NUTRITIONAL TOOLS ARE REALLY GOING TO SERVE AS THE PRIMARY TO LAYERS UPON WHICH YOUR SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCOLS ARE GOING TO REST AND AGAIN I WANT EMPHASIZE THAT YOUR SUPPLEMENTTATION PROTOCOL MAY BE ZERO SUPPLEMENTS IT COULD INCLUDE NO SUPPLEMENTS WHATSOEVER AND THAT WULD BE PERFECTLY FINE PROVIDED THAT YOURS SLEEPING AS WELL AS YOU WANT TO A NEED TO YOU'RE ABLE TO FOCUS AND WORK AS WELL AS YOU WANT TO ANEED TO YOU'RE ABLE TO PERFORM PHYSICALLY AS WELL AS YOU WANT TO ANEED TO AN YOU FEEL THAT YOUR HORMONS AND RELATED FUNCTIONS ARE WHERE YOU WANT THEM HOWEVER FOR MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING MOST EVERYTHING RIGHT THEY WANT TO EXPLORE HOW THEY CAN MAKE THINGS LIKE THEIR SLEEP THEIR FOCUS THEIRE HORMON FUNCTION EVEN BETTER AND THATS WHERE SUPPLEMENTATION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND WHEN I SAY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I MEAN IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO EXPLORE IN A RATIONAL AND REGIMENTED WAY THEIR COUPLE OF BIG THEMES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A FEW TIMES DURING TO DAY'S PODCASTHA LIKE TO REITERATE NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CRUCIAL TO DEVELOPING A RATIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL THE MOST IMPORTAN OF WHICH IS UNLESS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUNTATIONAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS COVERAGE OF VIDEMENS MINERALS DIGESTIVE ENZIMES PROBIOTICS PREBIATICS AND ADAPTIGENS WE SHOULD REALLY BE FOCUSING ON SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT INCLUDE ALL THOSE THINGS I JUST LISTED OFF ALL COMBINED IN ONE SUPPLEMENT ARE FINE I SIMPLY DON'T SEE ANY OTHER PRACTICAL OR REASONABLE WAY TO GET EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS THROUGH SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS HOWEVER WHEN YOU WANT A START THINKING ABOUT AND ACTUALLY PRACTICALLY EXPLORING AS LIKE SUPPLEMENTATION FOR SLEEP OR HORM ON HEALTH OR COGNIFUNCTION THE SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS ARE GOINGTO GIVE YOU THE MOST POWER AND CONTROL THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN FIND THE MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSES THAT YOU CAN RULE OUT THINGS THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE FOR YOU OR THAT MAY BE DETRIMENTAL FOR YOU IN WHATEVER FASHION AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS IT'S ALSO ABOUT A RIVING AT SMALL KITS OR COCKTAILS OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT YOU CAN REALLY MANAGE IN WORK WITH THAT YOU'RE NOT DEPENDENT ON BUT THAT YOU REALLY FEEL CAN AUGMENT THE VARIOUS ACPECTS OF YOUR HEALTH THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ABOUT EVEN THOUGH WE HAD COVERAGE OF SPECIFIC SUPPLEMENTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN THESE DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE TO DAY'S EPISODE AS REALLY GEARED TOWARD GIVING YOU RESOURCES AND A FRAME WORK TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO APPROCH SUPPLEMENTATION HOW TO NAVIGATE STICKING POINTS AND PAIN POINTS AND SUPPLEMENTATION HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMEN WITHOUT SPENDING AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE FINANCES TO ALLOW FOR A LOT OF EXPLORATION OF SUPPLEMENTS HOW TO NARROW IN ON THE MOST EFFECTIVE SUPPLE ENTS THE MOST QUICKLY AND DERIVE ALL THE BENEFITS THAT YOU CAN FROM THEM AND AS A FINAL POINT THAT IS REDUNDANT WITH A FEW OF THE THEMES WE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY BUT THAT I DON'T THINK I EVER REALLY EXPLICITLY STATED IS THAT WHILE THE WORD SUPPLEMENT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THESE COMPOUNDS AR SOMETHING JUST TO ADD ON TOPOF OR COMPENSATE FOR DEFICIENCIES IN NUTRICION OR OTHER AREAS OF YOUR LIFE MANY OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY QUITE POTENT COMPOUNDS THESE ARE POTENT NON PRESCRIPTION MOLECULES THAT REALLY CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE IN TERMS OF EURABILITY TO THINK MORE CLEARLY SLEEP BETTER SUPPORT YOUR HORMON FUNCTION BUT AS ALWAYS THEY ARE JUST ONE ELEMENT WITHIN AN EKO SYSTEM OF OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS YOUR BEHAVIORS WHICH INCLUDES DUSON DONTS SUCH AS YOUR NUTRICION MAYBE EVEN SUCH AS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT YOU ALSO MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE TAKING OR HOPING TO BE TAKING LESS OF OR I'M REMOVING COMPLETELY AGAIN THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN DISCUSSION WITH PHYSICIANS IF YO'RE GOIN TO DO IT AT ALL BUT THE REAL POINT HERE IS THAT WHAT WE CALL SUPPLEMENTS ARE ACTUALLY A POWERFUL GEAR WITHIN A LARGER SYSTEM AIMED AT EACH IN EVERY ONE OF US CUSTOMIZING TOOLS FOR OUR MENTAL PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANTS IF YOU'RE LEARNING

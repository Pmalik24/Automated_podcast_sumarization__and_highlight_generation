WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLASCIENCE SCIENCE PACETOI MANDUR HUBERMEN AND O'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NEURO SCIENCE OF FEAR WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT TRAMA AND POST DRAMATIC STRESS DISORDERS THE NOURO SCIENCE OF FEAR HAS A LONG HISTORY IN BIOLOGY AND IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY HOWEVER IVE THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE FIELD OF NEUROL SCIENCE HAS SHED LIGHT ON NOT JUST THE NOURAL CIRCUITS MEANING THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL THE FEAR RESPONSE AND THE WAYS THAT IT DOES IT BUT SOME IMPORTANT WAYS TO EXTINGUISH FEARS USING BEHAVIORALTHERAPES DRUG THERAPES AND WHAT WE CALL BRAIN MACHINE INTERFASES TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE AND YOU ARE GOING TO COME AWAY WITH BOTH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIOLOGY OF FEAR AND TRAMA AS WELL AS MANY PRACTICAL TOOLS TO CONFRONT FEAR AND TRMA IN FACT WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS ONE VERY RECENTLY PUBLISH STUDY IN WHICH FIVE MINUTES A DAY OF DELIBERATE EXPOSURE TO STRESS WAS SHOWN TO ELLEVIATE LONG STANDING DEPRESSIVE AND FEAR RELATED SYMPTOMS WE WILL GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT STUDY AND THE PROTOCALL THAT EMERGES FROM THAT STUDY A LITTLE LATER IN THE PODCAST BUT IT STANDS AS A REALLY IMPORTANT SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVE EXAMPLE OF HOW STRESS ITSELF CAN BE USED TO COMBAT FEAR TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHERE WE ARE GOING I'LL JUST LAY OUT THE FRAMEWORK FOR TO DAY'S PODCAST FIRST I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF FEAR AND TRAMA LITERALLY THE CELLS AN CIRCUITS AND CONNECTIONS IN THE BODY AND CHEMICALS IN THE BODY THAT GIVE RISE TO THE SO CALLED FEAR RESPONSE AND WHY SOME TIMES BUT NOT ALWAYS FEAR CAN TURN INTO TRAMA I WILL ALSO DESCRIBE THE BIOLOGY OF HOW FEAR IS UNLEARNED OR WHAT WE CALL EXTINGUISHED AND THERE TOO YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME SERIOUS SURPRISES YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN FOR INSTANCE THAT WE CAN'T JUST ELIMINATE FEARS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO REPLACE FEARS WITH A NEW POSITIVE EVENT AND AGAIN THERE ARE TOOLS WITH WHICH TO DO THAT ND I'LL TEACH YOU THOSE TOOLS TO DAY BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE IN SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS LETIC GREENS AS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE ODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AN TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRITIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH ARE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOT MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSERTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITH OUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LLGIVE YOU FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR  TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION END THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN ND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEIRE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN SO WHAT IS FEAR FEAR FALLS INTO A CATEGORY OF NERVOUS SYSTEM PHENOMENON THAT WE CAN RELIABLY CALL AND EMOTION AND IT IS HOTLY DEBATED NOWADAYS AND IT'S BEEN HOTLY DEBATED REALLY FOR CENTURIES WHAT AN EMOTION IS AND WHAT AN EMOTION ISN'T NOW THAT'S NOT A DEBATE THAT I WANT TO GET INTO TO DAY ITHINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT EMOTIONS INCLUDE RESPONSES WITHIN OUR BODY QUICKENING HEART RAY CHANGES IN BLOOD FLOW THINGS THAT WE EXPERIENCE AS A WARMING OR A COOLING OF OUR SKIN BUT THAT THERE'S ALSO A COGNAT OF COMPONENT THERE THOUGHTS THEIR MEMORIES THERE'S ALL SORTS OF STUFF THAT GOES ON IN OUR MIND END IN OUR BODY THAT TOGETHER WE CALL AN EMOTION AND THERE'S A VAST AMOUNT OF INTEREST AND LITERATURE DEVOTED TO TRY N T UNDERSTAND HOW MANY DIFFERENT EMOTIONS THERE ARE HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE EMOTIONS AND THAT CERTAINLY A TOPIC THAT WE WILL EMBRACE IN A FUTURE PODCAST EPISODE BUT TO DAY I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT FEAR AS A RESPONSE BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FEAR AS A PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND AS A COGNITIVE RESPONSE THEN WE CAN GET DOWN TO SOME VERY CONCRETE MECHANISMS AND SOME VERY CONCRETE AND PRACTICAL TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED TO DEAL WITH FEAR WHEN FEAR IS NOT WANTED SO LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT WHAT FEAR ISN'T MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH STRESS BOTH AS A CONCEPT AND AS AN EXPERIENCE STRESS IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE IT INVOLVES QUICKENING OF THE HEART RATE TYPICALLY QUICKENING OF BREATHING BLOOD FLOW GETTING SHUTTLED TO CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY AND NOT TO OTHERS IT CAN CREATE A HYPER VIGILANCE OR IN AWARENESS TYPICALLY THAT AWARENESS IS NARROWER LITERALLY NARROWER IN SPACE LIKE A SODOSTRAW VIEW OF THE WORLD THEN WHEN WE ARE RELAXED AND IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT WE CANNOT HAVE FEAR WITHOUT HAVING SEVERAL IF NOT ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE STRESS RESPONSE HOWEVER WE CAN HAVE STRESS WITHOUT HAVING FEAR LIKEWISE PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE PHRASE AN OR THE WORD RATHER ANXIETY ANXIETY TENDS TO BE STRESS ABOUT SOME FUTURE EVENT ALTHOUGH CAN ME ANOTHER THINGS AS WELL WE CAN'T REALLY HAVE FEAR WITHOUT SEEING OR OBSERVING OR EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF ANXIETY BUT WE CAN HAVE ANXIETY WITHOUT HAVING FEAR SO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO REALISE IS THAT FEAR IS BUILT UP FROM CERTAIN BASIC ELEMENTS THAT INCLUDE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND THEN THERE IS TRAMA AND TRAMA ALSO REQUIRES A SPECIFIC WHAT WE WILL CALL OPERATIONAL DEFINITION AND OPERATIONAL DEFINITION IS JUST A DEFINITION THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE A CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE BOTH AGREE ON OR MOSTLY GREE ON WHAT THE MEANING OF A GIVEN WORD IS IT MAKES CONVERSATIONS MUCH EASIER IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE IF WE ALL HAD OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR MORE THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT THERE BE A FEWER MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND ARGUMENTS AND WE'D ALL A MOVE A LOT FURTHER AS A SPECIES BUT THAT'S ANOTHER TOPIC ENTIRELY THE OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TRAMA IS THAT SOME FEAR TOOK PLACE WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES STRESS AND ANXIETY AND THAT FEAR SOMEHOW GETS IMBEDDED ORE ACTIVATED IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SUCH THAT IT SHOWS UP AT TIMES WHEN IT'S MAL ADAPTID MEANING THAT FEAR DOESN'T SERVE US WELL AND IT GETS REACTIVATED AT VARIOUS TIMES LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING THAT SCARED YOU BUT YOU SUDDENLY HAVE WHAT FEELS LIKE A PANIC ATTACK IN YOUR INDEEP FEAR WELL THAT'S POST DRAMATIC STRESS THAT'S POST DRAMATIC FEAR SO I DONT WAN TO GET BOG DOWN TOO MUCH IN THE NOMIN CLATURE BUT WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS BUILDING UP A SORT OF A SERIES OF LAYERS WHERE STRESS AND ANXIETY FORM THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING FEAR AND TRAMA AND THEND THERE ARE OTHER PHRASES OUT THERE THAT WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIMENSION N THINGS LIKE PHOBIAS AND PANIC ATTACKS PANIC ATTACKS ARE THE EXPERIENCE OF EXTREME FEAR BUT WITHOUT ANY FEAR INDUCING STIMULUS SOTZ KIND OF LIKE TROMA AND A PHOBIA TENDS TO BE EXTREME FEAR OF SOMETHING SPECIFIC FEAR OF SPIDERS FEAR OF HEIGHTS FEAR OF FLYING FEAR OF DYING THESE KINDS OF THINGS  THE REASON FOR LAYING ALL THAT OUT THERE IS NOT TO CREATE A WORD SOUP TO CONFUSE US RATHER IT IS TO SYMPLIFY THE ISSUE BECAUSE NOW THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PHRASES TO DESCRIBE THIS THING THAT WE CALL FEAR AND IN RELATED PHENOMENA WE CAN STARTE JUST FOCUS ON TWO OF THESE ISSUES FEAR AND TROMA AS IT RELATES TO SPESIFIC BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES SPECIFIC COGNITIVE PROCESSES AND WE CONSTRUCT TO DISECT HOW FEARS ARE FORMED HOW FEARS ARE UNFORMED AND HOW NEW MEMORIES CAN COME TO REPLACE PREVIOUSLY FEARFUL EXPERIENCES SO IN THIS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A COMMON LANGUAGE AROUND FEAR AND TROMA I WANT TO POINT OUT AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AUTONOMIC AROUSAL RELATES TO THIS ASPECT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WE CALL THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AUTONOMIC MEANS AUTOMATIC THAT SOMEWHAT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE THERE ARE ASPECTS OF YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT YOU CAN CONTROL BUT YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROLS THINGS LIKE DIGESTION EURINATION SEXUAL BEHAVIOR STRESS WHEN YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE WHEN YOU WANT TO BE ASLEEP IT BASICALLY HAS TO BRANCHES TO IT TWO BRANCHES MEANING TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ONE IS THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SYMPATHY HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH INCREASING ALERTNESS THINK OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AS THE ALERTNESS NERVOUS SYSTEM IT'S WHAT RAMPS UP YOUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS RAMPS UP YOUR LEVELS OF VIGILANCE THINK ABOUT IT AS THE EXCELERATOR ON YOUR ALERTNESS AND ATTENTION THE OTHER BRANCH OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THE SO CALLED PARISYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM I KNOW THAT'S A MOUTHFUL THE PARISYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ARE THE CELLS AND NEURONS AND CHEMICALS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE CALMINC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO SYMPATHETIC IS ALERTING PARISYMPATHETIC IS CALMING AND IN ACSYS SORT OF A C SAW TO ADJUST YOUR OVER ALL LEVEL OF ALERTNESS SO FOR INSTANCE RIGHT NOW I'M ALERT BUT I FEEL PRETTY CALM I'M NOT READY TO GO TO SLEEP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE ANYAT A NAP I'M ALERT BUT I'M CALM I'M NOT IN A STATE OF STRESS OR PANIC SO THAT C SAW WE COULD A IMAGINE IS MORE OR LESS LEVEL MAY BE IT'S TILTED UP A LITTLE BIT A TO THE SIDE OF INCREASE SYMPATHETIC OR ALERTNES A RATHER THAN PARISYMPATHETIC BECAUSE I FEEL WIDE AWAKE IF I WERE SLEEPY THE OPPOSITE WOULD BE TRUE THE PARISYMPATHETIC SIDE WOULD BE INCREASED RELATIVES OF THE SYMPATHETIC SIDE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT ONE OF THE MAIN ASPECTS IS IN ASPECT THAT'S GOING TO COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO DAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS IT'S CALLED THE H P A AXIS THE H P  AXIS STANDS FOR HYPOTHLEMIC PETUITARY A DRENAL AXIS THE HYPOTHALEMUS IS A COLLECTION OF NURONES IT'S AN AIR OF YOUR BRAIN REAL ESTATE THAT'S DEEP IN THE BRAIN AT THE BASE OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTAINS MANY MANY DIFFERENT AREAS THAT CONTROL THINGS LIKE TEMPERATURE AND DESIRE TO HAVE SEX DESIRE TO EAT THE THIRST A IT ALSO CONTROLS A THE DESIRE TO NOT MAT HAVE SEX NOT EAT NOT DRINK MORE WATER OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF FLUID SO IT HAS ACCELERATORS EMBREAKS IN THEIR AS WELL THE HYPOTHALEMUS CONNEX TO THE SO CALL PETUITARY THE PETUITARY LIVES CLOSE TO THE ROOF FOR YOUR MOUTH IT RELEASES HORMONES INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM AND SO THE HYPOTHALEMUS HAS ITS ABILITY TO TRIGGER THE RELEASE OR PREVENT THE RELEASE OF PARTICULAR HORMONES LIKE CORTISAL OR THE HORMONES THAT GO STIMULATE OVERIES TO PRODUCE ESTROGEN OR TESTS TO PRODUCE TESTASTERONE OR A DRENALS TO PRODUCE A DRENALINE AND SPEAKING OF THE ADRENALS THAT A AND THE H P  ARE THE ADRINALS YOU HAVE TWO GLANDS AT SIT ABOVE YOUR KIDNEYS IN YOUR LOWER BACK THEY RECEIVE SIGNALS BY WAY OF NERVE CELLS NURONS AND BY WAY OF HORMONES AND OTHER THINGS RELEASED FROM THE BRAIN AND ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY AND THEY RELEASE DIFFERENT HORMONES AND OTHER TYPES OF CHEMICALS INTO THE BODY AND THE TWO MAIN ONES THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TO DAY ARE A DRENALINE ALSO CALLED EPINEPHRAN AND CORTISAL BOTH OF THOSE ARE SO CALLED STRESS HORMONES BUT THEYARE NOT ALWAYS INVOLVED IN STRESS THERE ALSO INVOLVED IN WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AH WHEN YOU ARRIVE A WHEN YOU SCUSE ME WHEN YOU RISE FROM SLEEP AND SO THIS H P A AXIS SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF IN THE FOLLOWING WAY THE H P  AXIS INCLUDES A PIECE OF THE BRAIN THE HYPOTHALEMUS THE PETUITARY AND THE ADDRINAL SO IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THREE PART SYSTEM THAT CAN USE YOUR BRAIN TO ALERT OR WAKE UP YOUR BODY AND PREPARE IT FOR ACTION AND IT CAN DO THAT IN THE SHORT TERM BY TRIGGERING THE RELEASE OF HORMONES AND CHEMICALS THAT MAKE YOU A ALERT AND READY TO GO RIGHT AWAY AND BY TRIGGERING THE RELEASE OF NOR TRANSMITTERS AND HORMONES AND OTHER CHEMICALS THAT GIVE THAT ALERTNESS A VERY LONG TAIL A VERY LONG LATENCY BEFORE IT SHUTS OFF AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE OF THE HALMARKS OF FEAR AND ONE OF THE HOLMARKS OF TRAMA IS THAT THEY INVOLVE FER RESPONSES THAT ARE LONG LASTING EVEN IF THOSE FEAR FULL E THENTS THE EVENTS IN THE WORLD THAT TRIGGER THE H P A AXIS CAN BE VERY BRIEF LIKE A CAR THAT ALMOST HITS YOU AS YOU STEP OFF THE CURB OR SOMETHING A GUNSHOT THAT GOES OFF SUDDENLY AND IT'S JUST A VERY QUICK LIKE OU FIVE HUNDRED MILLISECOND ARE ONE SECOND EVENT THE FER RESPONSE CAND REVERBERATE THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM BECAUSE THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS H P  AXIS HAVE A FAST COMPONENT AND A LONGER LASTING COMPONENT AND THE LONGER LASTING COMPONENT CAN ACTUALLY CHAIN NGE NOT JUST THE CONNEXTIONS OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND THE WAY THAT AURE ORGAN'S WORK LIKE A HEART AND THE WAY THAT WE BREATHE IT ACTUALLY CAN FEED BACK TO THE BRAIN AND LITERALLY CONTROLLED GEN EXPRESSION WHICH CAN TAKE MANY DAYS AND BUILD OUT NEW CIRCUITS AND NEW CHEMICALS THAT CAN IMBED FEAR IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THAT MIGHT SOUND VERY DEPRESSING BUT THERE'S A REASON AND THERE'S AN ADAPT OF REASON WHY THERE'S THE SLOW AND FAS PHASE OF THE H PA AXES IND THE THE FEAR RESPONSE AND FORTUNATELY THAT GENE EXPRESSION AND THE LONG ARC OF THE FEAR RESPONSE THE WAY IT KIND OF LIVES IN OUR SYSTEM KINA LIKE A A PHANTOM IN SOME WAYS CAN ALSO BE LAVERAGE TO UNDO THE FEAR RESPONSE TO EXTINGUISH THE FEAR RESPONSE AND REPLACE IT WITH NON FEARFUL ASSOCIATIONS SO LET'S DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE NARRL CIRCUITS AND BIOLOGY OF FEAR BECAUSE IN DOING THAT WE CAN START TO REVEAL THE LOGIC OF HOW TO ATTACK FER IF THAT'S THE GOAL WE CAN'T REALLY HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT FEAR WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE FAMOUS AMIGDULA FAMOUS BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE BY NOW HAVE HEARD OF THE IMIGDULA AMIGDULA MEANS ALMOND IT'S AN LMON SHAPED STRUCTURE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAINS YOU HAVE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE YOUR BRAIN IN ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE YOUR BRAIN THE IMIGDULA IS PART OF WHAT WE CAN CALL THE THREAT REFLEX AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CONCEPTIALIZE FEAR AS INCLUDING A REFLEX SO MUCH AS YOU HAVE REFLEXES THAT CAUSE YOU TO LIFT YOUR FOOT UP IF YOU ARE TO STEP ON SOMETHING SHARP YOU LITEALLY HAVE A A REFLEXTS WITHIN YOUR SPINAL CORD THAT CAUSES YOU TO LIFT UP ONE FOOT AND EXTEND THE OTHER ONE TOWARD THE GROUND LEV ERE NOT ITS THAT YOU ALWAYS THINK THAT YOU STEP ON SOMETHING SHARP YOU PULL YOUR FOOT UP BUT YOU ACHALY STEP ON SOMETHING SHARP YOU PULL YOUR FOOT UP AND IN PULLING IT UP THERE'S ANOTHER REFLEXT THAT'S ACTIVATED THAT AS YOU EXTEND YOUR OTHER LEGS SO THAT YOU DON'T FALL OVER SIMILARLY IN THE PROCESS OF EXPERIENCING FEAR YOU HAVE A REFLEX FOR PARTICULAR EVENTS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THAT REFLEX INVOLVES THINGS LIKE QUICKENING OF YOUR HART RATE HYPER VIGILANCE AH YOUR TENTIONAL SYSTEMS POP ON AM INCREASED ABILITY TO ACCESS A ENERGY STORES FOR MOVEMENT AND THOUGHT AND SO FORTH BUT JUST LIKE THAT STEP ON THE TACK REFLEX EXAMPLE ALL OF THE NARRL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING CALM WITH BEING ABLE TO GO TO SLEEP WITH BEING ABLE TO VISUALIZE THE FULL PICTURE OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT LITERALLY TO SEE YOUR ENTIRE ENVIRONMENT OR TO HEAR OTHER THINGS AROUND YOU ALL OF THOSE GET SHUT DOWN WHEN THE SO CALLED THREAT REFLEX GETS ACTIVATED AND THE IMIGDULA IS PART OF THE THREAT REFLECT SO MUCH SO THAT WE CAN REALLY SAY THAT IT'S THE FINAL COMMON PATHWAY THROUGH WHICH THE THREAT REFLEX FLOWS IN OTHER WORDS THE IMIGDULA IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE THREAT RESPONSE BUT THE THREAT REFLEX AND THE THREAT RESPONSE IS KIND OF A DUMB RESPONSE IT'S NOT A SOPHISTIC ATED THING ITS VERY GENERIC AND THIS IS ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT POINT ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF THE FEAR SYSTEM IS THAT ITS VERY GENERALIZABLE IT'S NOT DESIGNED FOR YOU TO BE AFRAID OF ANY ONE THING SURE THERE ARE SOME DEBATES AND PROBABLY SOME A GOOD DATA OUT THERE THAT SUPPORT THE FACT THAT HUMAN BABIES ARE INATELY MEANING REQUIRES NO LEARNING INNATELY AFRAID OF CERTAIN THINGS LIKE HEIGHTS OR SNAKES OR SPIDERS THERE'S DEBATE ABOUT THIS AND THE DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW THE QUALITY OF THE EXPERIMENT ET CETERA BUT THE REAL CAPACITY OF THE FEAR SYSTEM IS THAT WE CAN BECOME AFRAID OF ANYTHING PROVIDED THAT THIS THREAT SYSTEM IS ACTIVE ATED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME EXTERNAL EXPERIENCE SO THE WAY I LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE EMIGDULA IS NOT AS A FEER CENTERE BUT THAT IT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE THREAT REFLEX I'D LIKE YOU TO ALSO INTERNALIZE THE IDEA THAT THE THREAT REFLEX INVOLVES THIS ACTIVATION OF CERTAIN SYSTEMS AND SUPPRESSION OF ALL THE SYSTEMS FOR CALMING THE PAR SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM AND NOW I AM GOING TO DESCRIBE THE WAY THAT INFORMATION FLOWS INTO AND THROUGH THIS THREAT REFLEX AND IN DOING THAT IT WILL REVEAL HOW SPECIFIC THINGS LIKE A SPIDER LIKE A SNAKE LIKE A PHYSICAL TROMA LIKE A CAR ACCIDENT LIKE A FEAR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING WHATEVER HAPPENS TO SCARE YOU OR SCARCE SOMEBODY HOW THAT GETS ATTACHED TO THIS REFLEX BECAUSE THIS REFLEX IS VERY GENERIC IT DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO BE AFRAID OF IT ONLY KNOWS HOW TO CREATE THIS SENSATION THIS INTERNAL LANDSCAPE TAT WE THINK OF AS PERE SO WHILE THE EMIGDULA MIGHT LOOK LIKE AN OMEND ITS ACTUALLY PART OF A MUCH BIGER COMPLEX OR COLLECTION OF NURANS CALLED THE EMIGDULOID COMPLEX THAT COMPLEX HAS ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE TO FOURTEEN AREAS DEPENDING ON WHOSE A WHICH NERANATOMIST IS NAMING THINGS IN CARVING IT UP A INERA SCIENCE AND IN MUCH ABIOLOGY A WE LIKE TO JOKE THAT THERE ARE LUMPERS AND THERE ARE SPLITTERS SO SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DRAW BOUNDARIES BETWEEN EVERY LITTLE DISTINCT DIFFERENCE AND SHEY ALL WITHOUTS A SEPARATE ARE AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE LUMPERS THEY SAY WELL LESSAND YOU KNOW WHY COMPLICATE THINGS LESS LUMP THOSE TOGETHER I'M NEITHER A LUMPER NOR A SPLITTER AM I'M SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN I THINK THE NUMBER A TWELVE IT IS A GOOD NUMBER IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE EMIGDULA WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT TO US WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THE EMIGDULA IS NOT JUST A AREA FOR THREAT IT'S AN AREA FOR GENERATIN THREAT REFLEXES THAT INTEGRATES LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION SO FOR THE THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT TO KNOW I MAN TO IVE YOU SOME NAME SOME NOMING CLATURE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T YOU CAN TUN OUT FOR THIS BUT BASICALLY INFORMATION FROM OUR MEMORY SYSTEMS LIKE THE HYPPOCAMPUS AND FROM OUR CENSORY SYSTEMS OUR EYES OUR YEARS ARE KNOWS OUR MOUTH ET CETERA SO TASTE INFORMATION VISION A AAUDITORY INFORMATION TUCH ET CETERA FLOW INTO THE SO CALLED LATERAL PORTION OF THE EMIGDULA FLOWS INTO OR THE AMIGDULOID COMPLEX IT FLOWS INTO THE LATERAL PORTION AND THEN THERE ARE MULTIBLE OUTPUTS FROM THE EMIGDUL AND THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THE OUTPUTS OF THE IMIGDOLA HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS BUT THEIR TWO MAIN PATHWADS ONE INVOLVES THE HYPOTHALEMUS WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT BEFORE THIS COLLECTION OF NURONS THAT CONTROL LOT OF OUR PRIMITIVE DRIVES FOR O FOR SEX FOR FOOD FOR THIRST AND FOR FOR WARMTH ET CETERA AND IT ALSO FEEDS OUT TO AR DRENALS THOSE GLANDS TAT YOU LEARN TO ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO TO CREATE A SENSE OF ALERTNESS AND ACTION IT ALSO FEEDS OUT WHAT I MEAN BY FEEDS OUT BY THE WAY IS THERE ARE NURONS THAT SEND WIRES WE CALL THOSE WIRES ACS ONS CONNECTIONS WHERE THEY CAN RELEASE CHEMICALS AND TRIGGER THE ACTIVATION OF DIFFER BRAINAIRIES SO IT FEEDS OUT TO OTHER BRAN AREAS SUCH AS THE P A G P  G IS VERY INTERESTING FOR OUR DISCUSSION TODAY IT'S THE PERI AQUODUCTAL GRAY THE PERIAQUODUCTAL GRAY CONTAINS NURONS THAT CAN TRIGGER FREEZING CAN TRIGGER THE A SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE FAWNING RESPONSE ON WHICH IS KIND OF AN APPEASING RESPONSE TO TRAMATIC EVENTS BUT SOME PEOPLE OUTRIGHT FREEZE IN RESPONSE TO FEAR WE'VE HEARD OF FIGHT OR FLIGHT AND INDEED THE PATHWAY THAT I'M DESCRIBING CAN CREATE A SENSE OF FIGHT AND A CAUSE PEOPLE TO WANT TO LEAN IN IN AN AGGRESSIVE WAY TO COMBAT THINGS THAT THEYARE AFRAID OF OR FLIGHT TO RUN AWAY A ESSENTIALLY TO AVOID BY MOBILIZING THE THING THATS THAT THEY FEEL THER THREATENED BY NOW EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME THREAT SOME OF THE THAT HAS SAY A FEAR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING A MIGHT HESITATE OR MOVE AWAY FROM APODIUM OR HESITATE OR MOVE AWAY FROM RAISING THEIR HAND A IF RAISING THEIR HAND MENT THAT THEY MIGHT BE CALLED ON AND AND WOULD BE PUBLIC SPEAKING SO THERE'S FIGHT AND FLIGHT BUT THERE IS ALSO THE FREEZE RESPONSE AND THE FREEZE RESPONSE S CONTROL BY NUMBER BRAIN CENTERS BUT THE PERIAQUODUCTAL GRAY THE P A G IS CENTRAL FOR THE FREEZE RESPONSE AND NURONS THERE ALSO CREATE WHAT ARE CALLED INDOGENOUS OPIOIDS MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE OPIOID CRISIS WHICH IS A A CRISIS OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION GIVEN OUT TOO BROADLY FOR PEOPLE TO DONEEDA WHO ARE BECOME ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS A THOSE ARE ECOGENOUS OPIOIDS BUT OPINDOGENOUS OPIOIDS OR CHEMICALS RELEASED FROM NURONS IN THE P A G AND FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY THEY GIVE US A SENSE OF NUMBING THEY AHI NUMUS AGAINST PAIN AND YOU CAN IMAGIN WHY BIOLOGY WOULD BE ORGANIZED THIS WAY A THREAT OCCURS OR SOMETHING THAT WE PERCEIVE AS A THREAT WERE AFRAID OF IT AND A NATURAL ANALGESIC IS RELEASED INTO OUR BODY BECAUSE THERE'S LIKELY TO BE AN INTERACTION THAT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THAT'S PHYSICALLY UNCOMFORTABLE SONCE THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN INDOGENOUS RELEASE OF THESE A OPIOIDS AND THAT'S OCCURRING IN THE P A G THE OTHER AREA AND AGAIN SORRY TO TO LITTER THE CONVERSATION WITH THESE A NAMES OF STRUCTURES BUT SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO A ENJOYED KNOWING THESE STRUCTURES IT YOUR FINE IF YOU DISUNDERSTAND WIT THE STRUCTURES DO A IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE NAMES THAT'S FINED BUT THE OTHER STRUCTURE IS THE LOCUST SERULIOUS THE LOCUST SERULIOUS CREATES A SENSE OF AROUSAL BY RELEASING A DRENALINE APANEPHRAN AND NORAPINAFROMN A RELATED CHEMICAL INTO THE BRAIN SOBASICALLY THE ACTIVATION OF THE OF THE EMIGDELOID COMPLEX COULD BE FROM ANY NUMBER OF DIFFEREN THINGS A MEMORY OF SOMETHING FEARFUL AND ACTUAL SENSORY EXPERIENCE OF SOMETHING THAT'S FEARFUL AND BUT THEN THE THE FEUR RESPONSE ITSELF IS TAKING PART BECAUSE OF THE THREAT REFLEX GETS ACTIVATED AND THAT THREAT REFLEX THEN SENDS A WHOLE SET OF OTHER FUNCTIONS INTO ACTION FREEZING ACTIVATION OF THE DRENALS ACTIVATION LOCUS SERULIAS FOR AROUSAL AND ALERTNESS ACTIVATION OF THIS OF INDOGENOUS PAIN SYSTEM OR ANTI PAIN SYSTEM IN THE P  G THAT'S ONE PATHWAY OUT OF THE IMAGDULA THE OTHER PATHWAY OUT OF THE IMAGDILA IS TO A VERY INTERESTING AREA THAT TYPICALLIES ASSOCIATED WITH REWARD AND EVEN ADDICTION SO THIS MIGHT COME AS A SURPRIZE TO MANY OF YOU IN FACT ME AS A SURPRISE TO ME I REMEMBER WHEN THESE DATO REPUBLISH BUT THE THE EMIGDALOID COMPLEX ACTUALLY PROJECTS TO AREAS OF THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM THE SO CALLED NUCLEUS ACCUMBENTS THE MESOLYMBIC REWARD PATHWAY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT I WANT TO LOOK THAT UP OR THAT REMEMBER FROM THE DOPOMINE EPISODES WE HAVE PATHWAYS IN OUR BRAIN THEIR ASSOCIATED WITH PURSUIT MOTIVATION AND REWARD AND THE NURMOGULATOR DOPOMINE IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT FEELING OF CRAVING PURSUIT AND REWARD AND THIS THREAT CENTER IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND ACTIVATE THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM AND LATER YOU WILL REALIZE WHY THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WHY YOU CAN LEVERAGE THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO WIRE IN NEW MEMORIES TO REPLACE FEARFUL ONES SO I'VE BEEN HITTING YOU WITH A LOT OF NAMES OF THINGS BUT FOR THE MOMENT EVEN IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ALL THE NURO SCIENCE NAMES AND STRUCTURES AND SO FORTH I LIKE YOU TO JUST CONCEPTIALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A CIRCUIT IN YOUR BRAIN MEANING A SET OF CELLS AND CONNECTIONS THAT ARE ARRANGED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY YOU HAVE A THREAT REFLEX THAT CAN BE ACTIVATED AT ANY TIME VERY EASILY BUT WHAT ACTIVATES THAT THREAT REFLEX CAN DEPEND ON TWO THINGS ONE ARE PRIOR MEMORIES COMING FROM BRAINARIES THA ARE INVOLVED IN STORAGE OR MEMORIES WAR IT CAN BE IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCES THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THE NOW OCASO WERE SOMETHING FEARFUL TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW YOUR THREAT REFLEX COULD BE ACTIVATED WERE YOU TO REMEMBER SOMETHING VERY SCARY THAT HAPPENEDYOU IN THE PAST YOUR THREAT REFLEX COULD BE ACTIVATED AND THAT THREAT REFLEX CIRCUIT HAS TWO MAJOR OUTPUTS ONE OF THE MAJOR OUTPUTS IS TO AREAS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE THREAT RESPONSE FREEZING PAIN MANAGEMENT O AND ALERTNESS AND THE OTHER MAJOR OUTPUT IS TO AREAS INVOLVED IN REWARD MOTIVATION AND REINFORCEMENT K THERE'S A FOURTH COMPONENT AND I PROMISES IS THE LAST COMPONENT THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN TO THIS PICTURE OF THE NURL CIRCUITS FOR FEAR AND THIS IS A CIRCUIT THAT INVOLVES IN AREA OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND SOME OF ITS SUBDIVISION SO LITERALLY IN THE FRONT AND IT'S INVOLVED IN WHAT WE CALL TOPDOWN PROCESSING TOP DOWN PROCESSING IS THE WAY THAT YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAIN CAND CONTROL OR SUPPRESS A REFLEX A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE STEP ON THE TACK EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE BEFORE SO WHEN YOU STEP ON ATTACK YOU IMMEDIATELY PULL UP YOUR FOOT AND YOU EXTEND THE OTHER LEG THAT'S THE THE REFLEXT THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM INJURING YOURSELF AND FROM FALLING OVER HOWEVER IF YOU WANTED NOT THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO BUT IF YOU WANTED YOU COULD FOR INSTANCE PLACE YOUR FOOT ON TO ATTACK AND DECIDE NOT TO PULL YOUR FOOT AWAY IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND AGAIN I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO THAT BUT YOU COULD OVERRIDE THAT REFLEX THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF REFLEXES LIKE FOR INSTANCE GETTING INTO COLD WATER MOST PEOPLE WILL START TO A YOU KNOW HUDDLE THEIR BODY MOST PEOPLE WON'T WANT AGAIN TO THE COLD WATER MANY PEOPLEW JUMP OUT BUT ALL OF THAT IS REFLEXIVE AND SHOULD YOU WANT TO YOU COULD OVERRIDE THAT REFLEX THROUGH TOPDOWN PROCESSING YOU COULD TELL YOURSELF O I HEARD ON A PREVIOUS UPERMAN LAMPODCAST AR ON AN INSTGAMPOST THAT COLD WATER EXPOSURE CAN BE BENEFICIAL FROM A TABOLISM AND RAZILIANS AT CETERA INDEED IT CAN AND YOU CAN DECIDE TO GET INTO THE WATER AND TO STRETCH OUT YOUR BODY NOT TO HUDDLE AND YOU CAN FIGHT THOSE REFLEXES  THE FIGHTING OF REFLEX IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH TOPDOWN PROCESSING LARGELY THROUGH THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS YOU PROVIDE A NARRATIVE YOU TELL YOURSELF I WANT TO DO THIS OR I SHOULD DO THIS OR EVEN THOUGH I DON'T WANT TO I'M GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY SO TOP DOWN PROCESSING IS NOT JUST FOR GETTING INTO COLD WATER AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T FOR OVERRIDING REFLEXES THAT CAN DAMAGE US LIKE A STEPPING ON THE TAC EXAMPLE IT IS THE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN OVERRIDE ANY NUMBER OF INTERNAL REFLEXES INCLUDING THE THREAT REFLEX AND THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS BY GIVING A NEW STORY OR A NEW NARRATIVE TO THIS EXPERIENCE THAT WECALL THREAT AND YOU KNOW THE THREAT RESPONSE THE THREAT RESPONSES QUICKENING OF THE HARTRATE QUICKENING IN THE BREATHING WE DON'T GENERALLY LIKE THE FEELING OF A DRENALINE IN OUR SYSTEM SOME PEOPLE ARE SO CALL THE DRENALINE  JUNKEYS AND THEY GET A MIXTURE OF DOPAMIN AND A DRENALIN FROM CERTAIN HIGH INTENSITY EVENTS A I CONFESS IN IT YOU KNOWN PREVIOUS ASPECTS OF MY LIFE I I TENDED TO LIKE A DRENALINE  I DON'T THINK I WAS A YOU KNOW AT THE EXTREME OF THRILL SEEKING BUT I'M SOMEBODY THAT FOR INSTANSE I I TEND TO LIKE A I LIKE ROLLAR COSTERS I'VE DONE YOU KNOW VARIOUS THINGS WHERE I 'M FAMILIAR WITH AN I ENJOY H THE SENSATION OF A DRENALINE IN MY BODY BUT I ENJOY IT BECAUSE OF THE ALERTNESS THAT IT BRINGS IN THE HYPERICUITY THAT IT BRINGS MANY PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT WAY IN FACT I MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE SENSATION OF A LOT OF A DRENALINE IN THEIR SYSTEM IT MAKES THEM FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND OUT OF CONTROL WE WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT A DRENALIN AN A DRENLIN JUNKEYS AND A DRENALIN AVERSIVES A IN THE FUTURE BUT THE THREAT REFLEX INEVITABLY INVOLVES THE RELEASE OF A DREN NOLIN INTO THE SYSTEM AND THEN IT BECOMES A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU REMAIN STILL MOVE FORWARD OR RETREAT FROM THAT A DRENOLIN EXPERIENCE AND WHEN I SAY THE ITERNAL EXPERIENCE I MEAN THE THREAT REFLECTS SO THESFORTH COMPONENT OF FEAR IS REALLY OUR ABILITY TO ATTACH NARRATIVE TO ATTACH MEANING AND TO ATTACH PURPOSE TO WHAT IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS AND PURPOSES A GENERIC RESPONSE THERE'S NO NEGOTIATING WHAT FEAR FEELS LIKE THERE'S ONLY NEGOTIATING WHAT IT MEANS THERE'S ONLY NEGOTIATING WHETHER OR NOT YOU PERSIST WHETHER NOT YOU PAUSE OR WHETHER NOT YOU RETREAT SO THIS IS USUALLY THE POINT IN THE PODCAST WHERE I THINK PEOPLE START ASKING O K WHILE THERE'S THE BIOLOGY THERE'S THE MECHANISM THERE'S THE LOGIC HOW DO I ELIMINATE FEAR WELL AH IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE ALTHOUGH BY UNDERSTANDING THE LOGIC IN THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE CIRCUITS ARE BUILT WE CAN EVENTUALLY GET TO THAT PLACE I DO WANT TO PLANTS A FLAG AROUND A PARTICULAR TYPE OF TOOL OR A LOGICAL FRAME WORK AROUND A PARTICULAR SET OF TOOLS RATHER THAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OUT THROUGH THIS EPISODE AND BASED ON WHAT YOU NOW KNOW THAT THE THREAT REFLECTS GETS IN PUT END HAS OUTPUTS END ITS SUBJECT TO THESE TOP DOWN PROCESSING EVENTS THESE NARRATIVES YOU SHOULD BE ASKING YOURSELF WHAT SORT OF NARRATIVE SHOULD I APPLY TO ELIMINATE FEAR WELL FIRSTLES TAKE A STEP BACK AND IT JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITY WHICH IS THAT FEAR IS IN SOME CASES AN ADAPTIVE RESPONSE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE ELIMINATING FEARS THAT CAN GET THEM INJURED OR KILLT RIGHT THE REASON THAT THE FEAR THREAT RESPONSE AND REFLEXT EXISTS AT ALL IS TO HELP US FROM DYING TO HELP US FROM MAKING REALLY BAD DECISIONS IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT A NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPENED US THAT ARE NOT LEFAL THAT DON'T HARM US BUT THAT HARM US FROM THE INSIDE AND I THINK THAT O AND HERE ON BORROWING LANGUAGE A FROM AN EXCELLENT RESEARCH OR  WHO'S DONE IMPORTANT WORK IN THIS AREA AT HARVARD HIS NAME IS DOCTOR CARRY WRESTLER HE'S BOTH A MEDICAL DOCTOR AND A PIC SO AN EMTY P HE'S THE CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER OF MC CLEAN HOSPITAL HE'S A PROFESSOR OF SYCHITRY HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HE'S DONE EXTENSIVE AND IMPORTANT WORK ON FEAR I AM GOING TO REFER BAC TO DOCTOR WRESTLERS WORK SEVERAL TIMES DURING THIS PODCAST INCLUDING IMPORTANT AND SUPERINTERESTING WORK ON TRANSGENERATIONAL PASSAGE OR TRAMA A HE'S A ABSOLUTELY WORLD CLASS BIOLOGIST ABSOLUTELY WORLD CLASSICLINITION AND DOCTOR WRESTLER HAS DESCRIBED FEAR BEFORE AS CONTAINING A HISTORICAL COMPONENT SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT A READINESS FOR THINGS THAT MIGHT INJURE US OR KILL US IN THE IMMEDIATE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT ALSO PROTECTING US FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF OUR IMPORTANT NEED AND ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND WHAT HE DESCRIBES ARE M MEMORIES AS PROTECTIVE OR MEMORIES AS DANGEROUS YOU  SOME MEMORIES EVEN IF THEY EVOCASENSE OF FEAR IN US OR PROTECTIVE THEY PROTECT US FROM MAKING BAD MISTAKES THAT COULD GET US INJURED AR KILLED OR PUT US INTO REALLY HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OTHER MEMORIES ARE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY CREATE US SEND IN US OF DISCOMFORT AND THEY TO DELIMIT OUR BEHAVIOR IN WAYS THAT ARE MALADAPTIVE THAT PREVENT US FROM HAVING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS TO OTHERS HEALTHY JOB RELATIONSHIPS HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP T OURSELVES FRANKLY SO THIS LANGUAGE OF MEMORIES AS PROTECTIVE OR MEMORIES AS DANGEROUS IN THE CONTECTS OF FEAR A IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT I SAID IT'S REALLY A SOMETHING THAT I LIFTED FROM A DOCTOR WRESTLER ONE OF IS A MANY IMPRESSIVE A LECTURES AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF FEAR BECAUSE MUCH OF THE FEAR SYSTEM IS A MEMORY SYSTEM IS DESIGN TO IMBED A MEMORY OF CERTAIN PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES IN US SUCH THAT THE THREAT REFLECT IS ACTIVATED IN THE ANTICIPATION OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OK SO LET'S TALK FOR SECOND ABOUT HOW CERTAIN MEMORIES GET ATTACHED TO THIS FEAR SYSTEM AND THIS BRINGS US TO A BEAUTIFUL AND INDEED NO BELL PRIZE WINNING ASPECT OF BIOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY WHICH IS PAVALOVI AND CONDITIONING MANY OF YOU ARE POBLY FAMILIAR WITH PAVLOV'S DOGS AND THE FAMOUS PAVALOVIAN A CONDITION EXPERIMENTS A THEY GI SOMETHING LIKE THIS A IN A FEW AND PAVLOV DO THESE EXPERIMENTS AND RING A BELL A A DOG DOESN'T DO MUCH IN RESPONSE TO A BELL IT MIGHT ATTEND TO IT BUT IT DOESN'T SALIVATE TYPICALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE BELL HOWEVER IF YOU PARE THE RINGING OF A BELL WITH A PRESENTATION OF FOOD ENOUGH TIMES THE DOG WILL SALIVATE IN RESPONSE TO THE FOOD EVENTUALLYOU TAKE AWAY THE FOOD YOU JUST RING THE BELL AND THE DOG WILL SALIVATE IN RESPONSE TO THE BELL  SO IN THE CONTECT OF SO CALL PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING THESE THINGS HAVE NAMES LIKE CONDITION STIMULUS AND UN CONDITION AND STIMULUS AND RESPONSES PEOPLE OFTEN GET THESE MIXED UP IN A CAN BE LOW COMFUSING BUT I 'M JUST CON TO MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE FOR YOU THE UNCONDITION STIMULUS IS THE THING THAT EVOKES A RESPONSE UNCONDITIONALLY SO FOOD IS THE UNCONDITION STIMULUS IN EXAMPLE I JUST GAVE A FOOTSHOCK OR A LOUD BANG WOULD BE THE UN CONDITION STIMULUS IN A FOR INSTANCAN EXPERIMENT GEARE TOWARD EXPLORING FEAR THAT UNCONDITIONS TO MIS IS UNCONDITIONAL IT UNCONDITIONALLY EVOKES A STARTLE OR IN THE CASE OF FOOD SALIVATING THE BELL IN THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE IS WHAT WE CALL THE CONDITIONED STIMULUS OR THE CONDITIONING STIMULUS SOMETIMES PEOPLE MIX THESE UP THE CONDITION STIMULUS IS PARED WITH THE THING THAT NATURALLY CREATES A RESPONSE AND THEN EVENTUALLY THE CONDITION STIMULUS CREATES THE RESPONSE ITSELF YOU MAY THINK WELL THAT JUS SEEMS YOU KNOW ENDLESSLY BORING AND SIMPLE BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY THE WAY THAT ARE FIERCE SYSTEMS WORK EXCEPT UNLIKE PAVALOV'S DOGS YOU DON'T NEED MANY MANY PARRINGS OF A BELL WITH SOME UNCONDITION STIMULUS IN ORDER TO GET A RESPONSE YOU CAN GET WHAT'S CALLED ONE TRIAL LEARNING AND IN THIS CIRCUIT THAT INVOLVES THE IMIGDALA THE THREAT REFLEX THAN ALL THIS OTHER OF YOU KNOW STUFF THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER THE SYSTEM IS SET UP FOR LEARNING IT'S SET UP TO CREATE MEMORIES AND TO ANTICIPATE PROBLEMS IT'S A VERY GOOD SYSTEM BECAUSE IT WAS DESIGN TO KEEP US SAFE AND SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE ONE INTENSE EXPERIENCE ONE BURN ONE BAD BREAK UP ONE BAD EXPERIENCE PUBLIC SPEAKING ONE BAD EXPERIENCE WITH SOMEBODY'S PET SNAKE OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE CAN CAUSE INTENSE FEAR IN THE MOMENT A LONG REVERBATORY EXPERIENCE OF FEAR LIKE TROUBLE SLEEPING THAT NIGHT IN THE FOLLOWING NIGHT MEMORIES OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT ARE TROUBLING PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES EIRE TROUBLING ESSENTIALLY IT GETS WIRED IN AS A FEAR WITH ONE TRIAL WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER FORMS OF NEROL PLASTICITY NOR PLASTICITY OF COURSE JUST BEING THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE OTHER FORMS OF NERROL PLASISY LIKE LEARNING A LANGUAGE LEARNING A LEARNING MUSIC O LEARNING MATH THEY THOSE TAKE A WHILE WE DON'T GENERALLY GET ONE TRIAL LEARNING TO POSITIVE OR NEUTRAL EXPERIENCES WE GET ONE TRIAL LEARNING TO NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES SO THERES IS A SYMMETRY AND HOW WE'RE WIRED SO NOW YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW CLASSICAL CONDITIONING AS IT'S CALLED OCCURS YOU GO TO GIVE A PIANO RECITAL AS A KID YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU FREEZ UP AND ITS HORRIBLY EMBARRASSING AND EVEN IF YOU JUST FREES UP FOR A FEW SECONDS THE HEART RATE INCREASE AND THE PERSPIRING THE SWEATING AND THE A AND THE SHAME THAT YOU FEEL LEADS YOU TO WANT TO AVOID PLAYING INSTRUMENTS OR PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF OF A YOU KNOW PERFORMANCES FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME UNLESS YOU DO SOMETHING TO OVERCOME IT THAT'S ONE TRIAL LEARNING SOME PEOPLE IT TENDS TO BE MORE AN ACCUMULATION OF EXPERIENCES THEY HAVE A BAD RELATIONSHIP THAT LASTS AN ENTIRE SUMMER AND ENTIRE YEAR OR GOD FORBID A DECADE AND THEN THEY HAVE WHAT THEY FEEL IS OF A GENERAL SENSE OF FEAR ABOUT CLOSENESS TO OTHERS AND ATTACHMENT THESE ARE COMMON FEARS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE FEARS CAN BE IN THE SHORT TERM FEARS CAN BE IN THE LONG TERM THEY CAN BE IN THE MEDIUM TERM AGAIN THE FEAR SYSTEM IS VERY GUNERIC IT'S WIRED TO INCLUDE MEMORIES THAT ARE VERY ACUTE THAT HAPPEN WITHIN A MOMENT OR THAT INCLUDE MANY MANY EVENTS AN LONG PERIODS OF TIME THAT KIND OF FUNDL INTO A GENERAL SENSE OF YOU KNOW RELATIONSHIPS ARE BAD OR OF THIS PARTICULAR CITY OR LOCATION IS BAD SO THERE'S A KEY WHAT WE CALL TEMPORAL COMPONENT THERE'S A COMPONENT OF THE FEAR SYSTEM BEING ABLE TO BATCH LO MANY EVENTS IN TIME AND CREATE ONE SPECIFIC FEAR OR TAKE ONE VERY SPECIFIC ISOLATED INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED VERY BRIEFLY AND CREATE ONE VERY LARGE GENE NAL SENSE OF FEARS AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF OF THE LATTER A JUST A TO CON FLESH THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT I HAD A FRIEND COME VISIT MEAN SAN FRANCISCO SOME YEARS AGO AND THEIR CAR GOT BROKEN INTO ON FORTUNATE FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO IN IN THE MILL THEDAY NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING OR CAR IN SAN FRANCISCO THEYL BREAKIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY DOESN'T MATTER POLICE CAN BE HAVING COFFEE RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM ILL STILL DO IT FOR REASONS WE COULD DISCUSS THIS IS A PROBLEM THEY GOT THEIR BELONGINGS TAKEN AND THEY DECIDED THEY WERE NEVER COMING BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT THAT FOREVER COLORED THERE VIEW OF THE CITY WHICH I YOU KNOW FRANKLY UNDERSTANDING THE FIERSISTEM I CAN UNDERSTAND WE CAN HAVE ISOLATED INCIDENTS THAT WICK OUT TO BROAD DECISIONS ABOUT ENTIRE PLACES OR WE CAN HAVE MANY EXPERIENCES THAT FUNDAL INTO VERY SPECIFIC ISOLATED FEARS ABOUT PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES PLACES AND THINKS SO I LIKE TO TINK THAT BY NOW YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLI THE THREAT REFLEX THE FEAR RESPONSE AND HOW WE HAVE TOP DOWN CONTROL MEANING WE CAN ATTACH A NARRATIVE TO THE FEAR RESPONSE AND THAT THE FEAR RESPONSE CAN BE LEARNED IN ASSOCIATION WITH PARTICULAR EVENTS I HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT HOW THE LEARNING OCCURS SO I JUST WANE TO TAKE A MOMENT AND DESCRIBE THAT BECAUSE IT LEADS RIGHT INTO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO ELIMINATE FEARS AND INDEED HOW TO REPLACE FEARS WITH MORE POSITIVE EXPERIENCES THERE'S A PROCESS IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WE CALL NURROPLASTICITY NEROPLASTISY BROADLY DEFINED IS THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE BUT AD A CELLLAR LEVEL THAT OCCURS THROUGH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT MECHANISMS ONE OF THE MAIN MECHANISM SYST SOME THAT CALL LONG TERM POTENTIATION LONG TUR POTENTIATION INVOLVES THE STRENGTHENING OF PARTICULAR CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURONS THE CONNECTION SIGHTES BETWEEN NURONS WE CALL SCYNAPSES ACHALY TACHNICALLY SYNAPSES ARE THE GAPS BETWEEN THOSE CONNECTIONS BUT NONE THE LESS SYNAPSES ARE THE POINT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NURONS AND THOSE CAN BE STRENGTHEN SO THAT CERTAIN NURONS CAN TALK TO OTHER NURONS MORE ROBUSTLY THEN THEY HAPPEN TO BEFOR AND ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR EVENT THE THE CAR THE SNAKE THE PUBLIC SPEAKING THE THE TROM O THE HORRIBLE EXPERIENTS WIRING IN TO THE FIER SYSTEM WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A CHANGE IN SCYNAPTIC STRENGTHS WERE TALKING ABOUT NURONS THAT PREVIOUSLY DID NOT COMMUNICATE WELL COMMUNICATING VERY WELL IT'S LIKE GOING FROM A A OLD SCHOOL DIAL UP CONNECTION OR EVEN AN OLD SCHOOL TELEPHONE CONNECTION OR MORSE CODE CONNECTION OF COMMUNICATION TO HIGH SPEEDY THERN ET I'VE HAD TO A FIVEG CONNECTION IT GETS FASTER IT GETS MORE ROBUST IN ITS VERY VERY CLEAR THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET LONG TURM POTENTIATION AND LONG TURN POTENTIATION INVOLVES A COUPLE OF CELIAR MECHANISMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE RELEVANT TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT TREATMENTS TO UNDO FEAR AND I'LL JUST THROW OUT A COUPLE OF THE NAMES OF SOME OF THOSE CELLILAR ELEMENTS RIGHT NOW THE MAIN ONE IS THE SO CALLED N M D A RECEPTOR N METHELD ASPERTATE RECEPTOR AND WHAT THIS IS IS THIS IS A LITTLE DOCKING SIGHT LIKE A LITTLE PARKING SLOT ON A NURON AND WHEN A NURON GETS ACTIVATED VERY STRONGLY LIKE FROM AN INTENSE EVENT AN E EXAMPLE MY FRIEND THE INTENSE EVENT A ALMOST CERTAINLY ACTIVATED ENEM D A RECEPTORS RELATED TO THEIR CONCEPT OF PROTECTING THEIR PROPERTY IN THEIR CARS A THIS THE BREAK IN TO THEIR CAR CAUSE THE ENM D A RECEPTOR TO BE ACTIVATED NORMALLY THAT ENM DA RECEPTOR IS NOT EASILY ACTIVATING WHEN IT IS ACTIVATED IT SETS OFF A CASCADE A SERIES OF SIGNALS WITHIN THOSE NURONS THAT CHANGE THOSE NURONS IT CHANGES THE GENES THEY EXPRESS IT SHUTTLES MORE PARKING SPOTS TO THE SURFACE OF THOSE CELLS SO THAT THE COMMUNICATION TO THOSE CELLS BECOMES EASIER IT BECOMES FASTER AND SO THE WAY TO THING ABOUT THE ENEM D A RECEPTOR IS ITS USED SOMETIMES AT FOR NORMAL THINGS THAT WE DO EVERY DAY MAKING CUPS OF COFFEE AND THNGS LIKE THAT BUT ITS OFTEN USED FOR LEARNING ITS USED FOR CREATING ASNEW ASSOCIATIONS IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SO THE ACTIVATION OF THE ENEM D A RECEPTOR AND EL T P AND IT INVOLVES SOME OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF LIKE BRAIN DRIVE NEUTROPIC FACTORS AND CALCIUM ENTRY THINGS THAT WE CAN LEAVE FOR A DISCUSSION FOR FUTURE TIME BUT BASICALLY A WHOLE CASCADE OF EVENTS HAPPEN WITHIN CELLS THAT THEN MAKE JUST EVEN THE MERE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING OR SOME BODY OR SOME A VENT THAT HAPPEN ABLE TO ACTIVATE THAT THAT THREAT REFLEX OKE SO LONG TERN PROTENTIATION IS ONE OF THE MAIN MECHANISMS BY WHICH WE TAKE FORMALLY INOCUOUS OR IRRELEVANT EVENTS AND WE MAKE THEM SCERY WE MAKE THEM TRAMATIC ARE NURONS HAVE MECHANISMS TO DO THIS NOW FORTUNATELY THE ENM D A RECEPTOR AND LONGTERN POTENTIATION CAN ALSO RUN THE WHOLE SYSTEM AN REVERSE YOU CAN GET WHAT'S CALLED LONG TERM DEPRESSION AND THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DEPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH LOW MOOD OVERE TALKING ABOUT IS A WEAKENING OF CONNECTIONS YOU CAN GO FROM HAVING A VERY HIGH SPEYTHER NECT CONNECTION BETWEEN NURONS SO TO SPEAK TO A CONNECTION THAT'S MORE LIKE MORSE CODE OR IS LIKE A POOR DIALEPT CONNECTION ARE REALLY WEAK SIGNAL AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENING WHEN YOU EXTINGUISH A FEAR WHEN YOU UNLEARN A FEAR SO NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THERAPIES THAT ARE CARRIED OUT IN HUMANS THAT ALLOW FEARS TO BE UNDONE THAT ALLOW TRAMAS TO BE REVERSED SUCH THAT PEOPLE NO LONGER FEEL BAD ABOUT A PARTICULAR PERSON PLACE OR THING EITHER REAL INTERACTIONS WITH THAT PERSON PLACE OR THING OR IMAGINE INTERACTIONS WITH THAT PERSON PLACE OR THING THAT PROCESS AS I JUST MENTION ALSO INVOLVES THINGS LIKE THE ENEMDY A RECEPTOR BUT RATHER THAN STRENGTHENING THE THE CONNECTIONS THE FIRST THING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS THERE NEEDS TO BE A WEAKENING OF CONNECTIONS THAT ASSOCIATE THAN THE PER SIN PLACE OR THING WITH THAT THREAT REFLEX SUBSEQUENT TO THAT WE WILL SEE THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRENGTHENING OF SOME NEW EXPERIENTS THAT'S POSITIVE A THIS IS A KEY ELEMENT OF WHERE WE ARE HEADED CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK TO SIMPLY EXTINGUISH A FEAR ONE NEEDS TO EXTINGUISH A FEAR AND OR TRAMA AND REPLACE THAT FEARFUL OR TRAMATIC MEMORY OR IDEA OR RESPONSE WITH A POSITIVE RESPONSE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S RARELY DISCUSSE BOTH IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE BUT CERTAINLY IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION AROUND FEAR AND TRAMA THERES IS IDEA THAT WE CAN EXTINGUISH FEARS WE CAN REWIRE OURSELVES WE CAN ELIMINATE OUR TRAMAS AND INDEED WE CAN BUT THAT PROCESS HAS TO INVOLVE NOT JUST BECOMING COMFORTABLE WITH A PARTICULAR FEARFULL OF ENTEROTRMA BUT ALSO ATTACHING A NEW POSITIVE EXPERIENTS TO THAT FEAR PREVIOUSLY FEARFUL OR TRAMATIC EVENT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES OUT THERE THAT ARE IN CLINICAL USE TO TRY AN ALLEVIATE FEAR AND TRAMA AND INDEED PITISTI POSTRAMATIC STRESS DISORDER YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISING TO LEARN THAT MANY OF THOSE TREATMENTS SUCH AS ESCESS ARISE THE SELECTIVE CERETONE AN REUPTAKEN HIBITORS THINGS LIKE PROSAC AND SO LOFT AND SIMILAR ANOTHER ANTODEPRESSENTS OR THINGS LIKE BENSODIAZOPINES WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY LIKE PAIN KILLERS THEY THEY CREATE A ELEVATION IN CERTAIN TRANSMITTERS IN THE BRAIN LIKE GABA AMONG OTHERS THEY CAN HAVE A PAIN A RELIEVING EFFECT A THEY ARE GENERALLY HOWEVER CONSIDERED ANXILIOTICS THEY REDUCE ANXIETY AM AND EVEN ANTICYCOTIC DRUGS OR BATEA BLOCKERS SOMETIMES CALLED ADRONERGIC BLOCKERS DRUGS THAT ARE DESIGN TO PREVENT THE HEART FROM BEETING TOO FAST OR FTO REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE TO REDUCE SOME ELEMENTS OF THAT HYPOTHLEMIC PETUITARY ACESS RESPONSE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SOME DEGREE OF RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND FEAR AND PETIAST IN TAKING THESE VARIOUS COMPOUNDS INDEED THAT'S WHY THEYRE PRESCRIBE SO BROADLY BUT YOU MAY FIND IT INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT NONE OF THOSE CURRENT TREATMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NEROBIOLOGY OF FEAR AT LEAST NOT DIRECTLY RIHT PEOPLE THAT TAKE US US ARISE OFTENTIMES WILL EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN ANXIETY DEPENDS ON THE DOSAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL OF COURSE RITING Y HAVE TO WORK WITH HE DOCTOR A PSYCHATRIS TO TO DETERMINE WETHERE NOT THEIR RIGHT FOR YOU IN THE CORRECTDOSAGE IF THEY ARE RIGHT FOR YOU BUT THAT MODULATION OF ANXIETY CAN INDIRECTLY REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ONE WILL HAVE A PANIC ATTACK OR EXPERIENCE OF FEAR OR AND INTENSE EXPERIENCE OF FEAR RELIVING OF A TRAM BUT THE ESCESS ARISE THEMSELVES ARE NOT PLUGGING INTOS SOME SPECIFIC MECHANISM RELATED TO HOW FEAR COMES AB OUT IN THE SYSTEM IT'S AN INDIRECT SUPPORT THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THE GOAL OF MODERN PSYCHIETRY AND THE GOAL OF MODERN BIOLOGY IS TO PROVIDE MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING THAT LEADS TO TREATMENTS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT OTE ORE THE SORTS OF TREATMENTS THAT TAP INTO THE VERY FIER CIRCUITS THAT WE DESCRIBED BEFORE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MEMORIES ATTACHED TO A GERNERIC THREAT REREFLECTS AND RESPONSE AND THE THREAT REFLECTS RESPONSE CAN BE LINKED UP WITH THE DOPAMIN SYSTEM AND CAN WE LINKED UP WITH OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PAIN RELIEF AND ANXIETY AND SO FORTH AND SO THAT BRINGS US TO WHICH TREATMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FEAR CIRCUITRY AND THE CIRCUITRY RELATED TO TRAMA AND THE PRIMARY ONE TO BEGIN WITH IS THE SO CALLED BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES NOW OFTENTIMES WE ALL WISH I THINK FROM TIME TO TIME THAT THERE'S SOME SPECIFIC PILL THAT WE CAN TAKE OR THERE SOME MACHINE OR DIVICE THA WE CAN PLUCG OUR FINGER INTO OR THAT WE CAN I YUN'T PUT ON A HEADSET AND ALLOF A SUDDEN WE JUST REWIRE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM FEAR IS GONE TRAMAS GONE BUT IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY AND WHEN WE THINK OF LANGUAGE AND NARRATIVE AS A TOOL IN TO REWIRE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN COMPARISON TO THOSE KINDS OF IDEAS ABOUT PILLS AND MACHINES AND POTIONS IT STARTS TO SEEME A LITLEBAT WEAK RIGHT IF WE JUST THINK OH WELL HOW COULD TALKING ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT A WE RESPOND TO SOMETHING BUT ACTUALLY THERE THREE FORMS OF THERAPY THAT PURELY THROUGH THE USE OF LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE VERY STRONG POSITIVE IMPACT MEANING REDUCE FEARS AND TRAMAS AND THOSE THREE ARE PROLONGED EXPOSURE THERAPY COGNIVE PROCESSING OR CP T AND COGNIVE BEHAVIOR LTHERAPY AND I NOT GIN TO GO INTO THE ENTIRE LITERATURE AROUND PROLONGED EXPOSURE COGNAV PRO SYSTING AND COGNA BEHAVIORLTHERAPY BUT I WILL JUST ILLUSTRATE THE CENTRAL THEME THAT ALLOWS THEM TO WORK NOW REMEMBER THAT THE CIRCUIT FOR FEAR THE CIRCUIT FOR TRAMA INVOLVES THIS GENERIC REFLEX AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE TOP DOWN ELEMENTS COMING FROM THE FOREBRAIN IT'S VERY CLEAR BECAUSE IT'S BEEN MEASURED THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF ANXIETY THET PURE PHYSIOLOGICAL ANXIETY RESPONSE OF QUICKENING OF HEART RATE FLUSHING OF THE SKIN A SOMETIMES QUAKING OF THE HANDS THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF FEAR OVER TIME WHEN PEOPLE RECOUNT OR RETAIL THEIR TRAMA THAT THE FIRST TIME THEY DO THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S RECOUNTED IN A LOT OF DETAIL THERE IS A TREMENDOUS ANXIETY RESPONSE SOMETIMES EVEN AS GREAT OR GREATER THAN THE ACTUAL EXPOSURE TO THE FEARFUL EVENT OR TRAMA AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS DONE WITH A CLENISION PRESENT BECAUSE IT IS VERY TRAMATIC TO THE PERSON THEI'RE LITERALLY RELIVING THE TRAMA IN FULL RICH DETAIL AND THEY ARE EN COURAGE TO PROVIDE FULL RICH DETAIL THEY ARE O FTEN ENCOURAGE TO SPEAKIN COMPLETE SENTENCES TO FLESH OUT DETAILS ABOUT HOW THEY FELT IN INSIDE TO FLESH OUT DETAILS ABOUT THEIR MEMORIES GOING INTO THIS TRAMATIC OR FEARFUL EVENT GOING THROUGH IT AND AFTER REALLY A DIGGING IN TO ALL THE NUANTS AND CONTOURS OF THESE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCES BUT WHAT'S REMARKABLE IS THAT IN THE SECOND AND THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH RETELLING OF THESE TRAMATIC OR FEARFUL EVENTS THAT ANXIETY RESPONSE IN THE THE AMOUNT OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE I SHOULD SAY THAT THE AMPLITUDE OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE BECOMES PROGRESSIVELY DIMINISHED WITH EACH RETELLING NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE SAYING WELL DA YOU KNOW IT TELL ISTORY ENOUGH TIMES A YOU KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY WEARS OFF JUST LIKE CAN BE WATCH A MOVING ENOUGH TIMES IF YOU HEAR THE SAME JOKE ENOUGH TIMES EVENTUALLY IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME IMPACT BUT THAT MEAN BE THE CASE RIGHT YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT THIS HIGH IMPLITUDE ANXIETY RESPONSE THIS HIGH IMPLITUDE ACTIVATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IN RETELLING WOULD ACTUALLY CREATE A EVEN DEEPER ROUTED FEAR RESPONSE IN TRAMA BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS AND EVERY CLINITION I SPOKE TO IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS EPISODE WHICH INCLUDE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIS PSYCHIATRICS AND PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WORK ON THE FIARCE SYSTEMATA AT A BIOLOGICAL LEVEL SAID THE EXACT SAME THING WHICH IS THAT A DETAILED RECOUNTING OF THE TRAMATIC AND FEARFUL EVENTS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO GET THE POSIVE EFFECTS OF PROLONGED EXPOSURE COGNICE PROCESSING AND COGNAIVE BEHAVIORALTHERAPY AGAIN THIS HAS TO BE DONE WITH THE APPROPRIATE SUPPORT SESIN SOMETHING THAT OM SHOULD BE TAKEN LIGHTLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS WE MENTION BEFORE THE FEAR RESPONSE CAN HAVE A VERY LONG LASTING A CONTOUR TO IT PEOPLE CAN I SOMETIMES HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND AFTERWARDS WILL TALK ABOUT SLEEP IN AL BIT BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE RETELLING IS IMPORTANT IN THE IDEA HERE IS TO TAKE WHAT WAS A TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY TROUBLING MEANING PHYSIOLOGICALLY TROUBLING PSYCHOLOGICALLY TROUBLING STORY AND TURN IT INTO WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A BORING BAD STORY OKA IT NEVER REALLY BECOMES A GOOD STORY AT THIS POINT IN THE TREATMENT PROCESS THAT WERE DESCRIBING SO A TERRIBLE EVENT IS A TERRIBLE EVENT PERIOD BUT THEREIS A WAY IN WHICH THE RETELLING OF THAT EVENT STARTS TO UNCOUBLE THE THREAT REFLEX FROM THE NARRATIVE AND WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE RETELLING INDETAIL OF THESE TRAMATIC EVENTS OF THESE FEARFUL EVENTS THE THREAT REFLEX IS ACTIVATED AT A PROGRESSIVELY LOWER AND LOWER AMPLITUDE SUCH THAT EVENTUALLY IT JUST BECOMES A REALLY BAD REALLY BORING STORY NOW THAT'S ONE PART OF THE PROCESS OF GETTING OVER A FEARCE WHAT WE CALL FEAR EXTINCTION AND WE CAN BRING OURSELVES BACK TO OUR EARLIER EXAMPLE OF PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING BECAUSE MANY STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE BOTH IN ANIMALS AND INHUMANS SHOWING THAT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU PARE A TONE IN A ABELL OR A BUZZER WITH A FOOTSHOCK THAT AN ANIMAL OR A PERSON WILL BRACE THEMSELVES FOR THE FOOTSHOCK EVENTUALLY YOU CAN JUST GIVE THE BELL OR TONE AND THE PERSON WILL EXPERIENCE THAT SAME FREEZING UP OR THE SAME FIGHT OR FLIGHT OR FREESE RESPONSE SO THEY CONDITION THAT BUT IF YOU GIVE THE TONE OR THE BELL OVER AND OVER AND THEREIS NO FOOTSHOCK THERE'S NO PAIN AND IN HUMAN SIST SOMETIMES ONE WITH FOOTSHOCK SOMETIMES A BELIEVE OR NOT WITH MILE BURN THER EVEN SOME STUDIES AS OLDER STUDIES YOU CAN DO THOSE NOW NOR WOULD YOU WANT TO BUT EVENTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THE TONE THE THE BELL NO LONGER EVOKES THAT RESPONSE OCASO YOU SEE THIS AS A A A REVERSAL OF THE CLASSICAL CONDITIONING AND WE CALL THAT REVERSAL EXTINCTION SO THE RETELLING OF THIS TRAMATIC OR FEEL FEAR FOR NARRATIVE EXCUSE ME FEARFUL NARRATIVE IS ESSENTIALLY AN EXTINCTION PROCESS NOW HOW IS THIS DONE ONE CAN DO THIS IN ATHERAPIS OFFICE FACE TO FACE THAT SOMETIMES DONE IT'S SOMETIMES DONE IN GROUP TYPE SETTINGS WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY STAND UP OR SIT IN FRONT OF A A GROUP SMALL OR LARGE AND RECOUNT IN DETAIL THEIR TRAMATIC EXPERIENCE IT SOMETIMES DONE BY PEOPLE WRITING OUT THE EXPERIENCE IN DETAIL AND WHICH ONE OF THESE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE ISN'T REALLY CLEAR THE LITERATURE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT A FEELING OF TRUST OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THE CLINITION OR THE PERSON AND THE GROUP IS ESSENTIAL SOME PEOPLE DON'T ACTSES TO BECAUSE A FINANCES OR OTHER LIMITATIONS TOO THERAPY OF THAT SORT IN THAT CASE JOURNALING IN DETAIL A HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE ALTHOUGH AGAIN I I WANT A CAUTION PEOPLE ABOUT REACTIVATING TRAMAS A WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE KINDS OF A SOCIAL SUPPORT THEY MIGHT NEED AROUND THAT REACTIVATION ND WE WILL TALKOLOBIT LATER ABOUT SOME OF THE CHEMICALS INVOLVED IN SOCIAL SUPPORT IN WHY THOSE HELP EXTINGUISH FEARS SO THE THING TO IMBED IN YOUR MIND IS THAT RECOGNITION OF THE EARLY TRAMATIC OR FEARFUL EVENT IN DETAIL OVER AND OVER IS KEY TO FORMING A NEW NON TRAMATIC ASSOCIATION WITH THAT EVENT OR PERSON SO THAT'S PART ONE YOU NEED TO DIMINISH THE OLD EXPERIENCE AND WHEN I SAY DIMINISH I MEAN REDUCE THE AMPLITUDE OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE NOW THIS IS JUST BUT ONE APPROACH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT OTHER APPROACHES TO ELIMINATING FEAR AND TRAMA AS WE GO FORWARD BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT DIMINISHING THE AMPLITUDE OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE IS THE FIRST STEP SO IT'S LIKE A CLEARING AWAY OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE PERSON PLACE OR THING AND THAT THREAT REFLECTS BUT EVEN AFTER THAT'S OCCURRED THERE IS AN SSENTIAL NEED TO RELEARN A NEW NARRATIVE WY IS THEIRE ESSENTIAL NEED TO RELEARN A NEW NARRATIVE OR CREATE A NEW ASSOCIATION WELL THAT HAS TO DO WITH THAT FEAR REFLECT CIRCUITRY AS YOU RECALL THEIR OUTPUTS TO AREAS US OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH DOPOMINE RELEASE AND REENFORCEMENT AND THAT WE NOW KNOW OFFERS THE CAPACITY FOR THESE FIER CIRCUITS IN THESE CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE TRAMA TO BE MAPPED ON TO NEW EXPERIENCES THAT ARE OF POSITIVE ASSOCIATION SO I'M GOING TO GIVE A KIND OF BASIC EXAMPLE IT'S A IT'S A KIND OF A SILLY EXAMPLE BUT A I'M GIVING IT AS A TEMPLET FOR WHAT COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFERENT EXAMPLES EXAMPLE I'LL GIVE IS LET SAY A A KID IS BIKING TO A PLAY SOKER SOKER PRACTICE AND THEY GET INTO A BAD CAR ACCIDENT TERRIBLE THING TO HAPPEN BUT THEY SURVIVE THEY RECOVER AND SOMEHOW AND WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY CERTAIN FEAR MEMORIES GET WIRAD IN MORE BROADLY OR MORE NARROWLY A SOMEHOW THIS KID JUST DOESIN WANT A BICYCLE ANY MORE AND THEY ACTUALY DON'TLY WANT TO PLAC SPORTS AND THEY ASHALLY JUST DON'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE THEIR KIND OF ISOLATING AND NOT INTERACTING WITH FRIENDS VERY MUCH AT ALL IT'S A PRETTY BROAD RESPONSE IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY SOME KIDS I WOULD JUST YOU DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT TA CYCLE ANY MORE DOWN THAT PARTICULAR STREET WELL THE PROCESS OF RETELLING THE NARRATIVE TO A CLINITION WOULD ALLOW AN EXTINCTION OF THE FEAR RESPONSE RIGHT SO A REDUCTION IN THE HEART RATE OF REDUCTION IN THE NARROWING A FOCUSE OR REDUCTION IN ALL THE THINGS THAT WE CONSIDER FEAR BUT A REALLY GOOD COGNA BEHAVIOURAL THERAPIST OR SOMEBODY THAT UNDERSTANDS THE NEROU SCIENCE OF FEAR AND TRAMA WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT SUFFICIONT THAT'S WHAT I'SREALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THIS CHILD THIS HYPOTHETICAL CHILD RELEARN A NEW NARRATIVE THAT THEY DON'T JUST MANAGE TO BITE TO SOKER PRACTICE OR MANAGE TO SPEND TIME WITH FRIENDS BUT THAT THEY ACTUALLY START WIRING IN NEW POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH BIKING TO PRACTICE WITH PLAYING SOKER WITH SOCIAL EVENTS AND AND THIS IS THE SOMEWHAT SURPRISING FEATURE OF THIS AND THAT THEY LINK THAT BACK TO THAT EARLY TRAMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT IT'S NOT JOUS THAT THEIRE REPLACING A BAD EXPERIENCE AND MEMORY WITH A GOOD EXPERIENCE IN MEMORY BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY HOLDING IN MIND IN THESE TOP DOWN NARRATIVE CIRCUITS IF YOU WILL THEY'RE HOLDING IN MIND A I'M NOT JUST BIKING TO SOKER PRACTICE I'M ACTUALLY BIKING SOCER PRACTICE AND I'M ENJOYING IT DESPITE THE FACT THAT I WAS IN A BAD CAR ACCIDENT DESPITE THE FACT THAT TWO MONTHS AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO OR MABE EVHEN TEN YEARS AGO I COULDN'T EVEN LEAVE MY ROOMOR I DIDN'T WANT TO ASSOCIE WITH ANYBODY SO THE BUILDING UP OF THE POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS ARE KEY AND THE LINKING OF THOSE POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE EARLIER TRAMATIC EVENT IS KEY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON THE TOP DOWN CIRCUITURY Y FROM THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX TO THIS THREAT REFLEX CIRCUIT IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER CONNECTIONS IN THAT CIRCUIT THE OTHER CONNECTIONS IN THAT CIRCUIT ARE WHAT WE CALL GLUDOMATURGIC AND EXCITATORY THEY ARE ALL ABOUT ACTIVATING OTHER NONS LIKE A CHAIN RYACTION ONE DRON ACTIVATES THE NEXT ACTIVATES THE NEXT LIKE DOMINOS FALLING THESE TOP DOWN CIRCUITS THAT FEED INTO THE THREAT REFLEX AND ALL ITS PARTS IS WHAT WE CALL INHIBATORY IT TENDS TO PREVENT ACTIVATION OF THOSE GIVEN CIRCUITRIES IT TENDS TO PREVENT ACTIVATION OF THE THREAT REFLEX SO IT'S ACTING AS A BREAK AND SO WHEN WE THINK OF POSITIVE EXPERIENCES BEING ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FORGETTING THAT THE CAR ACCIDENT WAS HORRIBLE OR FORGETTING THAT THE ASSAULT WAS ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ATTACHING A NEW POSITIVE MEMORY TO THE CIRCUITRY SO THAT THE PREVIOUS FEAR RESPONSE IS FAR LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR AND THAT IT REMAINS EXTINGUISHED SO JUST TO MAKE SURE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THERE'S A FIRST STEP WHICH INVOLVES RETELLING AND RELIVING IN ORDER TO EXTINGUISH THE FEAR IN THE TROMA TO REDUCE THE AMPLITUDE OF THE RESPONSE THEN THERE'S THE NEED TO REPLACE WERE ATTACH POSITIVE EXPERIENCES TO THE EARLIER WHAT WOULD BE TRAMATIC RESPONSE THE EXTINCTION HAS TO GO FIRST THIS IS KEY YOU CANT SIMPLY SAY OH YOU KNOW THE CAR ACCENT WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD THING BECAUSE I STATE HOMOLATE THAT THAT YEAR AND I GOT TO STUDY YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF THAT AND THAT COULD ALSOT BE TRUE BUT THAT WON'T NECESSARILY AND PROBABLY WON'T ELIMINATE THE FEAR OR THE TRAMATIC ASSOCIATION OF THE CAR ACCIDENT AND AGAIN IMUSING CAR ACCENT AS IT AS A GENERAL A EXAMPLER GENARIC EXAMPLE HERE OCAY SO THERE'S THE THREE PART PROCESS ONE DIMINISH THE OLD EXPERIENCE THROUGH REPETITIVE NARRATIVE AND ALMOST INEVITABLY THE INITIAL REPETITION OF THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY HIGH AMPLITUDE AND A QUITE TROUBLING BUT OVER TIME IT WILL REDUCE RIGHT YOURTURNING THE TERRIBLE REALLY UPSETTING STORY INTO A TERRIBLE BORING STORY THAT'S THE EXTINCTION PROCESS THEN THERE'S A RELEARNING OF A NEW NARRATIVE THAT INCLUDE SOME SORT OF SENSE OF REWARD AND THAT SENSE OF REWARD HAS TO BE TACT BACK ON TO THE TRAMATIC EVENT OR WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY A TRAMATIC EVENT AND THAT IS ALL THROUGH NARRATIVE ITS ALL THROUGH COGNITION AND I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT OFTENTIMES I THINK WE TEND TO UNDER VALUE THE IMPORTANCE OF RATIONALIZATION AND OF STORY AND OF NARRATIVE BUT THE PREFRONTAL PARTEX IS THIS AMAZING CAPACITY OF OUR BRAIN REAL ESTATE TO CREATE MEANING TO ATTACH MEANING AND PURPOSE TO THINGS THAT OTHERWISE AR JUST REFLECTIVE AND IN THE EXAMPLE OF A NICE BATHETS IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TRIVIAL IN THE EXAMPLE OF THE KID WITH THE CAR ACCEN IT BECOMES A LITTLE MORE A RELEVANT AND IN HE EXAMPLE OF THINGS LIKE PEOPLE A SURVIVING YOU KNOW A GENICIDE OR ATTACHING STORIES OF YOU KNOW OF GREAT VICTORY TO WHAT WERE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OF AS STORIES OF GREAT LOSS OF TIME OF PEOPL OF ANY NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PROCESS OF NARRATIVE IS ONE OF THE MAJOR WAYS THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN REWIRES ITSELF NARRATIVE SHOULD NOT BE UNDERVALUED AS A TOOL FOR RELIEVING FEAR AND TRAMA IN FACT NARRATIVE IS ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST POTENT WAYS THAT WE CAN REWIRE OUR FEAR CIRCUITRY AND THAT INDEED WE CAN FORM COMPLETELY NEW RELATIONSHIPS TO THINGS OVER TIME SO BASICALLY NARRATIVE SHOULD NOT BE UNDERVALUED AS A TOOL TO REWIRE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT IT HAS TO BE ENGAGED IN THE CORRECT SEQUENTE AND THAT CORRECT SEQUENCE IS FIRST EXTINCTION THEN RELEARNING A NEW NARRATIVE WITH POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS AND ATTACHING THOSE POSIVE ASSOCIATIONS TO THE FORMERLY TRAMATIC OR FEARFUL EVENT NOW I MENTION PROLONGED EXPOSURE THERABE COGNINT PROCESSING AND COGNINT BEHAVORAL THERAPY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE SEEKING RELIEF FROM A FEAR AND DRAMATIC EVENTS  YOU CAN LOOK UP A LICENSE CLINITIONS THAT CAN CARRY OUT A THOSE ONE OR SEVERAL OF THOSE TYPES OF THERAPIES I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT OTHER FORMS OF THERAPY ONE OF THE ONES THAT COMES UP A LOT IS SO CALLED E M D R I MOVEMENT TO SENSESATION REPROCESSING I DEVELOPED BY FRIENSEN SHIPERO I NNATIES A I MOENT TO SENSESATION REPROCESSING INVOLVES MOVING THE EYES SIDE TO SIDE WHILE RECOUNTING A TRMATIC OR FEARFUL NARRATIVE TYPICALLY WITH A ACCLINITION PRESENT AM WHY WOITD THAT WORK WELL A BASICALLY A WHEN I FIRST LHEARD ABOUT E M D AR A FROM MY STANCE AS A VISION SCIENTIST I THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING WAS CENECRAZYAND HALF BAKED FRANKLY I HEARD THESE THEORIES THAT OH IT A RECREATES A THE I MOVEMENTS IN RAPID IVE MOVEMENT SLEEP OR REMSLEEP A AND THAT'S COMPLETELY FALSE IT IT DOES NOT A I HEARD THE ARGUMENTS A E M D AR A ACTIVATES BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN WHICH I GUESS HYPOTHETICALLY WAS IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE IMPORTANT SOMEHOW A AND FRANKLY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT E M D AR ACUVATES BOTH SIDES OF THE BRAIN IN A WAY THAT'S BENEFICIAL I MEAN BY LOOKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT BY NOCULAR VISUAL CIRCUITS ARE ORGANIZED IT WILL DO THAT BUT IT NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO ME WHY M T AR WOULD WORK UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN A I SAW BECAUSE I REVIEWED A NO FEWER THAN FIVE PAPERS SOME IN ANIMAL MODELS OTHERS IN HUMANS A LOOKING AT LATERAL I MOVEMENTS MEANING I MOVES FROM SIDE TO SIDE WITH EYES OPEN NOT EYES UP OR DOWN AND WHAT WAS OBSERVED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS IN ALL OF THEM ACTUALLY  ALL FIVE OF THOSE PAPERS WAS A A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN THE ACTIVATION AN ACTUALLY AN INHIBITION A SUPPRESSION OF THE FEAR OR THREAT REFLECT CIRCUITRY WHICH WAS A JAW DROPPER FOR ME I THOUGHT WOW IS SHE WAS A JAW DROPPER I WIDENER FOR ME I THOUGHT OMAGUNIS MAYBE THIS  MD AR STUFF WORKS ACCORDING TO SOME MECHANISM AT MAY BE THIS IS THE MECHANISM AND INDEED MANY LABORATORIES NOT MIND BUT MANY LABORATORIES ARE NOW PURSUING THAT IDEA AND ITS LOOKING VERY LIKELY A WHY WITD THAT HAPPEN WELL JUST VERY BRIEFLY A LATERALIZED I MOVEMENTS OF THE SORT THAT I'M DESCRIBING AND UMOVING A HAND LIKE THIS BUT ALL TOS DO WITH MY EYES EVEN THE YOU KNOW A ITS  EMBARRASSING TO DO THAT CAUSE I KNOW IT LOOKS STRANGE I DON'T MIND CASA I'M DOING M D' AR AND A  M D' AR REDUCES ACTIVATION OF THE A MIGDULA AND RELATED CIRCUITRIES WHICH REDUCES ANXIETY AND REDUCES THE AMPLITUDE OF THE THREAT REFLEX REDUCES SYMPATHETIC AUTONOMIC AROUSAL IN OTHER WORDS WE FEEL CALMER OR WE FEEL LESS ALERT LESS DRESSED WHEN MOVING OUR EYES FROM SIDE ASIDE AND THE THE JUST SO STORY ABOUT THIS IS THAT A THESE ORE THE SORTS OF I MOVEMENTS THAT WE DO WHEN WE ARE EMBULATING MOVING THROUGH SPACE THROUGH SOME SORT OF SELF GENERATED MOTION AND ONE CAN MAKE UP A A PRETTY REASONABLE A STORY A IN THE EVOLUTIONARY CONTACTS ARE ETHOLOGICAL CONTACT THAT FORWARD MOVEMENT AND FEAR AR GENERALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT GENERALLY A FEAR RESPONSE INVOLVES A FREEZING OR RETREATING SOME PEOPLE WILL ADVANCE BUT THATS USUALLY A TRAINED ADVANCE IN RESPONSE TO FEAR SO FIRST RESPONDERS AND SO FORTH MOST PEOPLE FREEZE OR RETREAT WHEN THEY ARE AFRAID FORWARD MOVEMENT GENERATES THESE I MOVEMENTS IT DOES SEEM TO A SUPPRESS ACTIVATION OF THIS THREAT REFLAXT IN THE IMIGDOLAN PARTICULAR SO FOR THE MANY E M D R PRACTICIONERS OUT THERE THESE PAPERS I THINK ARE ARE GREAT A CELEBRATION AND I THINK THERE IS NOW INCREASING A EXCITEMENT ABOUT E M D R IN THE PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL COMMUNITY A FOR ITS UTILITY FOR TREATING FEAR TRAM AN PITIESTI HOWEVER I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT IN DISCUSSING TE M D' AR WITH VARIOUS COLLEAGUES OF MIND AT STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE I WAS TOLD THAT E M D R HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL IN PARTICULAR FOR SINGLE EVENT TYPE TRAMAS OR FEARFUL EXPERIENCES NOT SO MUCH FOR A RERELIEVING THE TRAMA OR FEELINGS OF FEAR ASSOCIATED FOR INSTANCE WITH AN ENTIRE BAD MARRIAGE OR IN ENTIRE CHILDHOOD BUT MORE FOR SINGLE A MORE ACUTE EVENTS THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED WITHIN A VERY CAND OF BRIEF NARRATIVE A BRIEF NOT NSILLY IN TIME BUT BUT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE CAR ACCIDENT THE BAD INTERACTION WITH ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL THE ASSAULT GOD FORBID THESE SORTS OF THINGS AND I REALIZE WERE DOWN IN THE THE A IN THE WEEDS OF TOPICS THAT ARE UNPLEASANT AD AND A OUKNOI SO I HAVE GREAT SENSITIVITY TO THAT BUT I THINK ITS ALSO IMPORETHAT WE BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT TROMATIZE PEOPLE SO IS  M D R USEFUL WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT WORKS FOR THESE SINGLE A EVENT OR KIND OF CO STRAINED EVENT TYPE TRAMAS THAT PEOPLE CAN DESCRIBE WHILE MOVING THEIR EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE GENERALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF A CLINITION HOWEVER IF WE THINK BACK TO THE MODEL OF HOW YOU EXTNGUISH AND THEN REPLACE A TRAMA OR FEAR REMEMBER IF TO DIMINISH THE OLD EXPERIENCE THE MPLITUDE OF THAT YOU NEED TO THAT'S THE EXTINGUISH PORTION THEN YOU NEED TO RELEARN A NEW NARRATIVE AN ATTACH REWARD TO THE OLD TRAMATIC EVENT E M D AR ONLY REALLY TAPS INTO THE EXTINCTION OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THE OLD EXPERIENCE I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE  M DAR PRACTITIONERS OUT THERE THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT THE ATTACHING OF THE NEW NARRATIVE AND REWARD BUT THERE I HAVE HEARD LESS AND IAVE SEEN FEWER OF PUE REVIEWED PAPERS ON THAT SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS LOGICALLY LET'S SAY AND INDEED IT'S THE CASE THAT OF SITTING DOWN IN A CHAIR MOVING EYE SIDE TO SIDE DELIBERATELY FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME REDUCES ACTIVATION OF THE THREAT REFLECTS I OR THE THE PATIENT OM IN THIS CASE RECITES OR REPEATS OVER AND OVER THE TRAMATIC OF ENT OR THE FEARFUL EVENT I'M DOING THAT IN THE PRESENCE OF A LOWER AMPLITUDE RESPONSE REMEMBER BACK TO WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE RE TELLING WORKS BEST IF THE FIRST TIME IT'S DONE THERE'S A HUGE AMPLITUDE RESPONSE AND THEN WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE REPEAT THAT RERESPONSE THE THREAT RESPONSE GETS LOWER AND LOWER WITH THE M D ARE YOUR SORT OF SHORT CIRCUITING CAN A SNEAKING AROUND THE CORNER OF THAT HIGH IMPLITUDE RESPONSE AND SO YOU ITS TAKING A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT APPROACH OF TRYING TO EXTINGUISH THE BAD FEELINGS IN BODY IN MIND ASSOCIATE WITH AN EXPERIENCE BY REDUCING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE SO IT SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT AND AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND  M D'AR PRACTITIONERS PLEASE CORRECT ME BUT AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE ISN'T AN ACTIVE COMPONENT TO E M DIAR OF RELEARNING A NEW NARRATIVE AN ATTACHING REWARD NOW REWARD AND ATTACHING REWARD REQUIRES A SOMEWHAT HIGH AMPLITUDE SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL IT REQUIRES A FEELING OF A VICTORY WHICH IS AROUSAL OKAITS POSIVE AROUSAL NOT NEGATIVE ROUSAL BUT IT IS AROUSAL SO I'M NOT FOCASSING ON THIS TO TRYING DIMINISH THE A POTENTIAL IMPACTOF  MDIAR I KNOW MANY PEOPLE OF A ACHIEVE GREAT RELIEF FROM I M DIAR BUT IT DOESN'T TAP IN TO ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE EXTINCTION AND RELEARNING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY AND THEREFORE I THINK ON ITS OWN AT LEAST IN MANY CASES IS UNLIKELY TO BE A COMPLETE THERAPY FOR FEAR AND TRAMA IF THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO'VE HAD TERRIFIC RESULTS OF THE M DIAR PLEASE LET US KNOW IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOU TWO WOULD BE THE IDEAL PLACE IF YOU'VE HAD BAD EXPERIENCES WITH AN I M DAR OR IT DIDN'T WORK FOR YOU ALSO LET US KNOW I THINK THAT E M DAR PRACTITIONERS LIKE MOST PRACTITIONERS IN THE PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SPACE ARE EAGER TO EXPAND THEIR PRACTICES IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE EFFECTIVE RATHER THAN CLINGING A A ARDENTLY TO SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS IS IN COMPLETER THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL SO I THINK THEY WOULD APPRECIATE THAT FE BACK AS WOULD I SO AS I MENTION BEFORE MOST OF THESE CERAPIES ARE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A A A SKILLED OFTEN A ONE WOULD HOPE A CREDENTIAL CLINITION A THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER THE DONT OF ACCESS TO THAT OR WHO ARE WORKING THROUGH STUFF THEY HAVE THINGS IN THEIR PAST THAT ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO THEM AND IAM AWARE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE WORKING THROUGH THOSE THINGS THROUGH JOURNALING THROUGH TALKING TO A FRIEND A THROUGH ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT S ARE NONTRADITIONAL APPROACHES ONE THING THAT REALLY PRETAINS TO EVERYBODY WHOSE WORKING THROUGH FEAR AND TRAMA OF ANY KIND IS THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL CONNECTION AS IT RELATES TO THE CHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND THE NORL CIRCUITS ASSOCIATED WITH FEAR AND TRAMA AND THIS IS A EMERGING LITERATURE IN NERAL SCIENCE THAT IS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL ONE BECAUSE IT'S A VERY CONSERVED BIOLOGY WE SEE IT BELIEVE AR NOT IN FLIES IN FRUITFLIES ACOMMONLY USE MODEL SYSTEM IN MICE AND INDEED IN HUMANS AS WELL AND THIS IS THE WORK OF DAVID ANDERSON'S GROUP AT CALTAC OF AGAIN OF DOCTOR WRESTLERS GROUP AT HARVARD MEDICAL END ELSEWHERE OF COURSE AND THIS IS THE WORK AS IT RELATES TO TACICINAN TACICINAN IS A VERY INTERESTING MOLECULE IN OUR BRAIN AND IT TURNS OUT THE TACICINAN IS ACTIVATED IN NURONS OF WHAT'S CALLED THE SENTIAL AMIGDULA AND SOME NEAR BY STRUCTURES SO REALLY SMACDAB WITHIN THE MIDDLE OF THIS THREAT REFLEX VERY SOON AFTER SOME TRAMATIC OR FEAR INDUCING EVENT OCCURS AND IT ACTUALLY SETS IN MOTION A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESTION AND POTENTIATION MEANING LONG TURNPOTENTIATION ACTIVATION OF AN EMDY A RECEPTORS AND SO ON IN THE CIRCUITS THAT REENFORCE THAT FEARFUL OR TRAMATIC EXPERIENCE NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT TACHICINAN IS ALSO THAT IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO LOW TO MODERATE LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND EVEN AND OF A GRESSION OF IRRITABILITY TACTIC KININ LEVELS ARE FURTHER INCREASE BY SOCIAL ISOLATION AND THAT SOCIAL ISOLATION IS OFTENTIMES WHAT CAN EXASCERBATE PRE EXISTING TRAMAS OR FEARFUL EVENTS AND IN A KIND OF BEAUTIFUL SYMETRY TO THAT KIND OF DARKEN DEPRESSING STORY SOCIAL CONNECTION WITH PEOPLE THAT WE TRUST AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DIRECT PHYSICAL CONTACT BUT JUST SOCIAL CONNECTION CONVERSING WITH SHARING A MEAL WITH IT COULD BE PHYSICAL TOUCH IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE THOSE SORTS OF CONNECTIONS ACTUALLY SERVE TO REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OR EVEN THE LEVELS OF TACIKINAN SO THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS THAT TRAMA IS TRAMATIC IN AN OF ITSELF FEARFUL EVENTS ARE HARD IN OF THEMSELVES AND IF PEOPLE ARE WORKING THROUGH THEM EITHER THROUGH CLINICAL WORK OR THROUGH INDIVIDUAL WORK IT IS IMPORTANT AND AN IDEALLY ONE WOULD STILL BE TRYING TO ACCESS SOCIAL CONNECTION OUTSIDE OF THAT SPECIFIC WORK RELATED TO THE TRAMA NOW IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE OUTSIDE OF THAT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE A YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH A CLINITION OR THERAPISTS TO THE POINT WHERE THERE'S REAL TRUST AND YOU FEEL A SOCIAL CONNECTION WITH THEM WONDERFUL BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY HAVE A MORE A TRANSACTIONAL A RELATIONSHIP TO THE I M D AR E M D R PRACTITIONER OR TO THEIR THERAPIST A OR THEIRE WORKING THROUGH THINGS ON THEIR OWN AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT REGULAR SOCIAL CONNECTION TRUSTING SOCIAL CONNECTION OF ANY KIND IS GOING TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THAT PROCESS AND SO THIS IS NOT AND OF JUST HANDUAVY A NEW AG STUFF LIKE O YOU KNOW YOU NEED SOCIAL CONNECTION THERE'S A ACTUAL NEURO CHEMICAL BASIS FOR SOCIAL ISOLATION THAT HAS AN AMPLIFYING EFFECT ON FEAR IN TRAMA AND THERE IS A NOR CHEMICAL BASIS FOR THE RELIEF FROM FEAR AND TRAMA AND ISOLATION AND IN THE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE ONE IS WORKING THROUGH THESE TRAMAS AND FEARS VERY INTENSELY IN A VERY DEDICATED WAY BUT THEN IS ALSO ENGAGING IN THE SORTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO DIMINISH THE AMOUNT OF TACIKINAN AND GOING TO SUPPRESS THOSE VERY CIRCUITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AMPLIFIED SO NEXT THIT LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME REALLY INTERESTING AND ALMOST KIND OF ERE SCIENTIFIC TFINDINGS AND THAT'S THE TRANSGENERATIONAL PASSAGE OF TRAMA OR PREDISPOSITION TO FEAR AND TRAMA THIS IS A  SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THAT'S BEEN DEBATED MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST REALLY FIFTY PLUS YEARS BUT IN MORE RECENT STUDIES HAVE REALLY PROVEN THAT WE IS HUMANS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO INHERIT A PREDISPOSITION TO TRAMA OR FEAR NOW THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE WILL BECOME TRAMATIZED OR EXPERIENCE EXTREME FEAR JUST BECAUSE OUR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS EXPERIENCE THAT IT'S A PREDISPOSITION IT'S A BIAS LET ME EXPLAIN THE PAPERS THAT FOCUS ON THIS FRILOBIT AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR EACH OF US ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PAPERS IN THIS AREA COMES TO US FROM SOEWHANE I MENTION EARLIER DOCTOR CARRY RESLER AT HARVARD AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS A SOCIATION OF F K B FIVE POLYMORPHISMS AND CHILDHOOD ABUSE WITH RISK OF POSTDRAMATIC STRESS DISTORDER SYMPTOMS AND ADULTS AND THERE ARE OTHER PAPERS AS WELL ANOTHER ONE FROM THE RESTOR LAVE FIRST AUTHOR BRIND S D I A S PARENTAL OLD FACTORY EXPERIENCE INFLUENCES BEHAVIOR AND NERAL STRUCTURE IND SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS AMEN A SUMMARIZE THESE PAPERS IN THEIR GENERAL CON TOUR AND PAPERS RELATED TO THEM ALTHOUGH FEEL FREE TO LOOK UP THE PAPERS I I JUST DESCRIBE WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THEM IN THE CAPTION IF YOU LIKE TO GO FURTHER BUT BASICALLY THESE EXPLORATIONS INVOLVE LOOKING AT THE HISTORIES OF HUMAN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD TRAMA OR ABUSE OF SOME KIND IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND THEN LOOKING AT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FEAR AND PTST TYPE SYMPTOMOLOGY IN THEIR OFFSPRING AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY IDENTIFIED IS THAT INDEED IF YOU HAD A PARENT AND THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A KIND OF ABIAS TOARD AN EFFECT WHERE IF THE FATHER HAD ABUSE O AND ITS SEVERE ABUSE OR MODERATE MODERATE ABUSE THAT ABUSE CAUSES A CHANGE IN HISTENETICS IN HIS SPERM THAT CAN BE PASSED ON TO OFFSPRING SUCH THAT THE OFFSPRING HAVE A LOWER THRESHOLD TO DEVELOP TRAMA OR EXTREME FEAR TO CERTAIN TYPES OF EVENTS NOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT PREDISPOSITION OR BIS IS NOT NECESSARILY TO THE SAME SORTS OF EVENTS IS NOT THAT THE ABUSE ITSELF GETS PASSED FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT IT'S A PREDISPOSITION AND THE THE TITLE OF THAT PAPER MENTION F K B FIVE SCUSE ME F  B P FIVE POLYMORPHISMS AND THE F K B P FIVE POLYMORPHISM MAPS TO A LOCATION IN THE GEKNOWN THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOCAL GLUTOCORTICOID SYSTEM WITH CORTESALL RELEASE SO THE PREDISPOSITION THAT ONE MIGHT INHERENT FROM HAVING A PARENT FATHER OR MOTHER BUT STRONGER TENDENCY TO INHERIT IT FROM THE FATHER WHO EXPERIENCED ABUSE IS ONE IN WHICH THE GLUCOCORTICOID SYSTEM THE CORDISOLL SYSTEM AND THAT H P A AXIS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE HYPOTHELEMIC PATUITARY A DRENAL AXIS IS SENSITIZED OR REACTIVE IN A WAY THAT SETS A LOWER THRESHOLD TO BECOME TRAMATIZED OR VERY AFRAID OF CERTAIN TYPES OF EVENTS BUT IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF ABUSE THAT THE PARENT EXPERIENCE NOW THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES OUT THERE I WILL HEAR THAT THERE'S PASSAGE OR TRANSGENERATIONAL PASSAGE OF ACTUAL TRAMA THE SPECIFIC TRAMA NOW THAT COULD BE THROUGH NARRATIVE TELLING YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY COME IS EXPOSED TO A LOT OF NARRATIVE ABOUT THEIR PARENTS TRAMA IN ONE FORMER ANOTHER IT MAY BE THAT THEY START TO INTERNALIZE SOME OF THAT TRAMA AND THERE COULD BE BECAUSE WE OBSEE CAN'T RULE IT OUT THERE COULD BE SOME OTHER SIGNATURES OF PRIOR SPECIFIC TRAMAS THEY GET PASED ON TO OFFSPRING BUT MORE LIKELY AND CERTAINLY WHAT THESE DATA ABOUT THESE POLYMORPHISMS POINT TO IS THAT WHAT GETS PASSED ON IS A PROPENSITY FOR THE THREAT REFLEX TO GET ACTIVATED AND ATTACHED TO A WIDER VARIETY OR TO LESS INTENTS TYPES OF IMPUTS AND EXPERIENCES AND THE IMPORTANT POINT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS THAT ITS NOT SOME MAGICAL MYSTERIOUS AND MYSTICAL THING THAT'S BEING TRANSPLANTED FROM PARENT TO CHILD ITS A GENE OR ITS A MODIFICATION IN ASET OF GENES THAT GIVES A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF RESPONSIVITY TO FEARFUL TYPE EVENTS OR EVEN A HEIGHT LEVEL OF RESPONSIVITY SUCH THAT THINGS THAT WOULDN'T BE FEAR INDUCING OR TROM INDUCING TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS CAN TRIGGER FEAR IN TROAMA IN THESE CHILDREN THAT INHERIT THIS PARTICULAR GENE NOW THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY ARE FATED TO FOREVER BE TROMATIZED OR LIVE IN FEAR SIMPLY NOT THE CASE ITS JUST A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU HAD A PARENT OR PARENTS THAT WERE TROMATIZED OR NOT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE AT LEAST AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THAT THE TREATMENTS FOR TROMA SHOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT I AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE AREN'T GENE THERAPEES CURRENTLY AIMED AT THESE PARTICULAR VARIANCE LIKE F C B P FIVE AND SO FORTH THAT COULD REVERSE THOSE PARTICULAR A GENETIC UNDERPINNINGS OF THE TROMA PREDISPOSITION SO THIS TRENSGENERATIONAL PASSAGE OF TRAMA THINK IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING IN LARGE PART BECAUSE IT BRINGS US BACK TO THE PS IDEA THAT THE THREAT REFLEX IS PART OF A LARGER SENSORY SYSTEM YOU KNOW NORMALLY WE THINK OF SEEING AS A SENSORY SYSTEM OR HERING IS A SENSORY SYSTEM BUT THE THREAT DETECTION AND THREAT LEARNING SYSTEM THE FEAR LEARNING SYSTEM IS IN MANY WAYS A SENSRY SYSTEM IS JUST A SENSORY SYSTEM THAT IS VERY GENERIC IN ITS RESPONSE THAT GENERIC RESPONSE AGAIN IS GOOD BECAUSE IT ALLOWS REFLEXIBILITY BUT ITS BAD BECAUSE IT REDUCES SPECIFICITY RIHT WE CAN ESSENTIALLY BECOME FEARFUL OR TROMATIZED BY ANYTHING IF THE CIRCI GETS ACTAVATED AND THESE PARTICULAR CHILDREN INHERIT A PREDISPOSITION FOR MORE THINGS AND LESS INTENSE THINGS TO TROMATIZE THEM IN A FEW MINUTES WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS INCLUDING SOME REALLY NEW EXCITING PROTOCALLS FOR DEALING WITH FEAR IN TROAMA BUT FOR A FEW MINUTES I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE DRUG TREATMENTS THAT ARE STARTING TO EMERGE AS PATENTIAL THERAPUTICS IN PARTICULAR FOR P TSD THE TWO DRUG TREATMENTS I'D LIKE TO PHOCUS ON ARE CEDEMINE ASSISTED PSYCHOTHERAPY AND M D  MA ASSISTED PSYCHOTHERAPY CURRENTLY CEDEMENE ASISTED PSYCHOTHERAPY IS LEGAL IT IS APPROVED PROVIDED IT IS PRESCRIBED BY BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICION IN THE UNITED STATES IAM NOT CERTAIN ABOUT OTHER AREAS OF THE WORLD M D  MA ALSO SOMETIMES CALLED ECSTASY A THERAPY IS IN CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE UAS IT IS STILL AN ILLEGAL DRUG TO POSSESS OR TO SELL OND BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT HOWEVER M D  MA IS BEING EXPLORED AS A POTENTIAL THERAPUTI C FOR PTISTI AND OTHER FORMS OF TRAMA AND OF COURSE EDEMINE AND M DIMA ARE ALSO BOTH BEING EXPLORED FOR CRONIC DEPRESSION EATING DISORDERS IN THE NUMBER OF OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS BUT FOR THE MOMENT I JUST LIKE TO TOUCH ON KEDEMINE AND M DIAMA AS THEY RELATE TO THE FIER CIRCUITRY AND TRAMA CIRCUITRY THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED IN THE EARLY PART OF THE EPISODE AND THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE BECAUSE I THINK THAT IN VIEWING THEM THROUGH THAT LENDS WE CAN GAIN SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO HOW THEY MIGHT BE PROVIDING THE SORTS OF RELIEF THAT SOME OF THE EARLY CLINICAL STUDIES ARE STARTING TO POINT TO KEDEMINE IS A DISSOCIATIVE AN AESTHETIC ASRITE IS A DISSOCIATIVE AN AESTHETIC ITS MAIN FUNCTION IS TO CREATE A STATE OF DISSOCIATION  IVE NEVER TAKEN KEDEMINE PERSONALLY SO I CAN'T DESCRIBE THE THE EXPERIENCE OF IT BUT A A COLLEAGUE OF MIND IN PSYCHIETRY A SHARED THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH A PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE OF IT AS MAKING THAT PATIENT FEEL AS IF QUOTE THEY WERE GETTING OUT OF THE COCKPIT OF A PLAIN BUT THAT THEY WERE OBSERVING THEMSELVES DOING IT AND THIS WAS OF COURSE JURING A A APPROVED THEIREPUT ECCESSION THAT THEY WERE DOING THIS AND THEY WERE IN SOME SORT OF INTENSE OVISUALIZATION ABOUT A DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE THEY WERE DESCRIBING SOME OF THEIR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS THE TRAMA AND THE NARRATIVE THAT THEY BASICALLY CREATED OR TOOK AWAY FROM THIS AND THAT WAS RELATE TO ME WAS ONE IN WHICH THE PATIENT FELT LIKE THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN BODY BUT THEY WERE ALSO VIEWING THEIR OWN BODY FROM THE OUTSIDE SO DISSOCIATIVE IN OTHER WORDS A AGAIN I'VE NEVER HAD THIS EXPERIENCE SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE A WITH KEDEMINE OR A THROUGH OTHER MEANS BUT WE MIGHT ONT TOD JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT KEDEMINE ACTUALLY DOES AND WHAT DISSOCIATION ACTUALLY DOES AT THE LEVEL OF NARAL CIRCUITS AND FOR THAT AND WE CAN LOOK TO THIS REALLY BEAUTIFUL PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED BY MY COLLEAGUES CARL DYCEROTH IN PSYCHIETRY A ROBERT MILANCA ALSO IN PCSYCHOTRY LEGION LOW ALSO A AT STAMFORD A THEY PARED UP OR TEEMED UP RATHER AM TO EXPLORE HOW STEMIC KEDAEMINE AA JUST CIRCUITRIES IN THE BRAIN AND WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WAS THAT A IT CHANGES THE RHYTHM OF CORTICAL ACTIVITY A IN CERTAIN LAYERS OF THE QUARTEX THE QUARTEX IS LIKE A LAYERED SANDWICH ON THE CORTICSCORTS BEING THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN A AND THERE IS A PARTICULAR RHYTHM ONE TE THREE HURTS RHYTHM ONE OF THREE HURTS JUST MEANS A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY OF ELECTRIC ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THIS CASE IN THESE LAYER FIVE NARONS OF RETROSPLENIAL QUARTEXS SO YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW A MUCH ABOUT RETROSPLINIAL QUARTAX OR A ONE O THREE HURTS RHYTHMS I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO JUST TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS THAT THERE IS NOW STARTING TO BE AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DRUGS LIKE KEDEMINE WORK TO CREATE THIS SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE A THAT THIS PATIENT AND OTHER PATIENTS DESCR IBE AS DISSOCIATION O YOU KNOW DISSOCIATION IN IN ITS ESSENCE IS REALLY ABOUT NOT FEELING WHAT'S HAPPENING IT'S ABOUT VIEWING WHAT'S HAPPENING FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN WHAT NORMALLY A ONE WOULD VIEW THAT EXPERIENCES TROM AND SO IF WE AN APPLUG THAT GENERAL NOTION OF DISSOCIATION AN CEDEMIN INDUCED DISSOCIATION INTO THE CIRCUIT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHERE WE HAVE THIS THREAT REFLECT INVOLVING THE IMIGDULA THESE OUTPUTS FOR FREEZING OR FOR REWARD IN THE ACCUMBANS AN WE'VE GOT THIS PREFRONTAL NARRATIVE COMING DOWN OM AS TOPDOWN PROCESSING IT BRINGS US RIGHT TO THAT PREFRONTAL CORTICAL IMPUT TO THE THREAT SYSTEM AND THAT NARRATIVE WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE IN MY REVIEW OF THE PAPER I JUST DESCRIBED PLUSA A REVIEW ON HOWCEDAMENE ASSYSTED A TRAMA RELIEF MIGHT WORK IS THAT IT SOMEHOW ALLOWS THE PATIONT THE INDIVIDUAL TO RECOUNT O THEIR TRAMA WHILE FEELING EITHER NONE OR A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES THAT THEY EXPERIENCED IN THE ACTUAL TRAMA OR FEARFUL EXPERIENCE SO IT'S A REMAPPING OF NEW ON TO OLD A NEW MEANING NEW FEELINGS ON TO OLD FEELINGS WHILSTING IN THE EXACT SAME NARRATIVE SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE EEM DIARE OF SUPPRESSING THE THREAT REFLECTS BUT IT SEEMS TO BRING IN A A REPLACEMENT OF PREVIOUS EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES ANSENSATIONS IN THE BODY WITH NEW ONES AND SO IN THAT WAY WE CAN SORT OF VIEW OR WE CAN TRY IN VIEW CEDAMINE ASSISTED PSYCHOTHERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRAMA AS BRINGING TOGETHER THE THRE ELEMENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE YOU WANT TO DIMINISH THE INTENSITY THE POTENCY OF THE OLD ORIGINAL TRAMA EXPERIENCE OR FEAR EXPERIENCE SO THAT SEEMS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THIS DISSOCIATION AND MAY BE THROUGH THE KIND OF ENAESTHETIC COMPONENT SO ITS A REDUCTION IN PAIN IN THE BODY A DISSOCIATION A KIND OF OBSERVING OF THE SELF THAT LEADS TO THE EXTINCTION OF THE TRAMA AND THE FEAR BUT THEN THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE AN AUTOMATIC OR CONT OF BUILT IN RELEARNING OF A NEW NARRATIVE AND NEW SET OF EXPERIENCES WHICH IS THE NEXT STEP OF THAT WE DESCRIBED EARLIER SO I IS AN INTRIGUING THERAPY IT'S ONE THAT'S A REALLY CATCHING ON AND THEIR MANY MANY CLENICS AROUND THE UES THAT ARE NOW DOING IT O WHETHER NOT IT TURNS OUT TO BE THE ULTIMATE TREATMENT FOR A TRAMA AND FOR FEAR IISN'T CLEAR MY COLLEAGUES INPSYCHIOTRY TELL ME THAT THAT'S UNLIKELY ALTHOUGH IT DOES SEEM TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING TRAMA OR HAVE EXISTING TRAMAS AND FEAR THAT ARE COUPLED WITH DEPRESSIVE SYMPTEMS BECAUSE THE DATA ON CEDAMINE AND DEPRESSION SEEMS TO BE QUITE STROMG ONOWLETS TALK ABOUT EM DIAMA EMDIAMA ALSO SOMETIMES CALLED ECSTASY OR MULLI OF IN IT'S RECREATIONAL FORM IS A POWERFUL SYNTHETIC DROGU O THAT AT LEAST AS FAR AS WE KNOW CREATES A STATE IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER CHEMICAL STATE IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THATS NORMALLY EXPERIENCE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT WELL WE HAVE SEVERAL NAURMODULATOR SYSTEMS IN OUR BODY NOR MODULATORS ARE CHEMICALS THAT CHANGE THE LIKELYHOOD THAT CERTAIN NERAL CIRCUITS WILL BE ACTIVE MEANING THEY CAN MAKE IT VERY LIKELY THAT CERTAIN CIRCUITS WILL BE ACTIVE AND MAKE IT VERY UNLIKELY THAT OTHER NERAL CIRCUITS WILL BE ACTIVE GOOD EXAMPLES OF NAUROMODULATORS ARE DOPOMINE CERATONIN A SEETOCOLINE NOR APINEFERAN THESE TEND TO WORK ON DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT THEY TEND TO BE ACTIVATED A MORE LESS IN PARALLEL T YOU CAN HAVE DOPOMINE RELEASED IN YOUR BRAINE AND ALSO NOR APINEFERAN A CAN AF CERATONA RELEASED IN YOUR BRAIN AND ALSO A SETOCOLINE SO IT'S NOT AN ALL OR NON KIND OF THING BUT THE DEGREES TO WHICH THESE THINGS ARE ACTIVATED TENDE TO VARY AND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SEA SAW TYPE A A PHENOMENON WITH DOPOMINE AND CERATONAN DOPOMINE MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVATINGE NERAL CIRCUIT S RELATED TO MOTIVATION CRAVING IN REWARD AND CERATONAN MORE TYPICALLY ACTIVATED IN RESPONSE TO A SITUATIONS OR CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE ARE VERY HAPPY ND CONTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE SO DOPOMINE IS MORE ABOUT PURSUING AND SEEKING CRETODAN IS MORE ABOUT A KIND OF A PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION WITH RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN ARE IMMEDIATE SPHERE THEY DON'T TEND TO A CERATONAN DOES INTEND TO PLACE THE BRAIN AND BODY INTO A MODE OF ACTION QUITE AS MUCH AS DOPOMINE DOES MORE OR LESS M DI MA IS A UNIQUE COMPOUND IN THAT IT LEADS TO VERY LARGE INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF BOTH DOPOMIN AND CERATONAN IN THE BRAIN AND BODY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THAT'S A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT A IS JUST SIMPLY NOT SEEN UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS FROM A SUBJECTIVE STANDPOINT PEOPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF M DIMA IN THE THERAPEUTIC SETTING TEND TO REPORT IMMENSE FEELINGS OF CONNECTION OR RESONENCE WITH PEOPLE OR EVEN THINGS WITH MUSIC WITH OBJECTS O CERTAINLY IF ITS A BEING DONE CONCHUNCTION WITH A FAMILY MEMBER OR PARTNER OR WITH A ATHERAPIS THEY WILL FEEL EXTREMELY CONNECTED TO THAT PERSON THEYWILL FEEL A VERY CLOSE UNDERSTANDING AND ASSOCIATION OFTENTIMES THAT GOES BEYOND WORDS A THERE IS A CHEMICAL REASON FOR THAT A IT TURNS OUT THAT M DI MA CAUSES MASSIVE RELEASE OF OXYTOSIN THIS NEROPEPTIDE THAT SASSOCIATE WITH PERABONDING AND WITH BONDING GENERALLY THE OXYTOSAN SYSTEM AND THE CERATONEN SYSTEM ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO ONE ANOTHER A IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND THEY TEND TO BE CO RELEASED OFTEN A AT THE SAME TIMES TAN BY THE SAME SORTS OF EVENTS SO M DI MA A IS ONE MECHANISM BY WHICH OXYTOSIN IS RELEASED IN THESE ENOMASSIVE AMOUNTS AND I SHOULD JUST RELAY SOME OF THE A LEVELS OF OXYTOSIN BECAUSE THER THE REALLY QUITE STRIKING GIVES A A KIND OF A A MORE VIVID PICTURE OF WHY IT IS THAT M D M A WOULD MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SO ASSOCIATED IN A POSITIVE WAY WITH THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO THEM WHILE THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DRUG SO THE PAPER RELATED TO THIS SIDE LIKE THE HIGHLIGHT IS IN THE JOURNAL PSYCHO NEURO ENDER CHRONOLOGY THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS PLASMA OXYTOSAN CONCENTRATIONS FOLLOWING MDY M A OR INTRONASAL OXYTOSIN IN HUMANS AND A JUST REMARKABLY M D M A INCREASED PLASMA OXYTOSIN LEVELS TO EIGHTY THREE POINT SEVEN THIS IS AN AVERAGE EIGHTY THREE POINT SEVEN PECIGRAM'S PERMIL LEADER ABOUT NINETY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MINUTES INTO THE M D MA SESSION COMPARED TO A TYPICAL LEVEL OF EIGHTEEN POINT SIX SO THIS IS A MASSIVE INCREASE IN OXYTOSIN AND I THINK THAT MASSIVE INCREASE IN OXYTOSIN IS PART OF THE REASON WHY PEOPLE HAVE THESE A FEELINGS OF CLOSE RESONENCE IN ASSOCIATION NOW THE DOPOMINE INCREASES ARE GENERALLY WHAT LEAD TO THE FEELINGS OF EUPHORIA INSIDE OF THE M D M A SESSION AND THEN THE CERETONIAN INCREASES IT IS THOUGHT OR WHAT LEAD TO THE FEELINGS OF SAFETY AND COMFORT SO AGAIN A VERY UNUSUAL CHEMICAL COCTAIL THAT WOULD NEVER BE SEEN AT LEAST NOT AT THIS AMPLITUDE A UNERANY NORMAL CONDITIONS A OUTSIDE OF AN M D M A CLINICAL PCYCLOF THER REPUTIC SESSION WHY WOULH THIS STATE OF MIND IN BODY BE POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRAMA WELL INDEED IT IS REVEALING ITSELF TO BE USEFUL FOR THE TREATMENT TRAMA AGAIN THESE ARE LEGAL CLENICAL TRIALS WHERE PEOPLE ARE A DOING THIS IN DISCOVERING THIS WHAT IT SEEMS TO ALLOW IS A VERY FAST RELEARNING OR A NEW ASSOCIATIONS TO BE TACKED ON TO THE PREVIOUSLY TRAMATIC EXPERIENCE SO AGAIN IT BRINGS US BACK TO THE SAME MODEL OF HOW PEOPLE EXTINGUISH FEARS IN TRAMAS AND REPLACE THEM WITH NEW EXPERIENCES WHEN THERE IS NO DRUG TREATMENT INVOLVED THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIMINISHING OF THE OLD EXPERIENCE MEANING AN EXTINCTION AND THEN A RELEARNING OF A NEW NARRATIVE WHAT THE CHEMICAL MILIEU OF M D M A SEEMS TO BE DOING IS CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THAT TO HAPPEN VERY FAST WITHOUT THE NEED FOR MANY REPETITIONS OF THE ORIGINAL TRAMA AND RELIVING OF THE ORIGINAL TRAMA PROBABLY BECAUSE THE RELIVING OF IT INSIDE OF ONE OF THESE M M A SESSIONS IS VERY ACUTE VERY INTENSE PLOS IT SEEMS TO BE OFFERING THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTINGUISH AND REWRITE IN OR WRITE IN A NEW NARRATIVE ASSOCIATE WITH THAT TRAMA VERY QUICKLY AS WELL SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT TREATMENTS LIKE M D M A THAT ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THESE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE MAGIC POTIONS IF YOU WILL THAT ALLOW ACCESS TO A PARTICULAR PROCESS THAT WOULD OTHERW IES NOT BE EXCESSIBLE IT'S MORE THAT THE TYPICAL PROCESS OF TRAMA AND FEAR REDUCTION THAT'S CARRIED OUT IN THINGS LIKE PROLONGED EXPOSURE COGNA PROCESS IN COGNA BEHAVIORAL THEREPY SEEMS TO BE COMPACTED INTO A MUCH SHORTER SESSION AND THAT SESSION IS PERFORMED AT A MUCH HIGHER INTENSITY HIER INTENSITY BECAUSE THE CHEMICAL OF MILIEU OF THE BRAIN IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AMIN THE A EXPERIENCE OF M D MA IS ONE IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE A VERY HEIGHTENED SENSE OF UFOR A VERY HEIGHTENED SENSE OF CONNECTION SO THAS POSITIVE EXPERIENCES ARE ESSENTIALLY PRIME TO BE WRITTEN IN AND OVER THE TRAMATIC EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVELS OF CEREPONENT IN THE SYSTEM AND PROUDLY OXITOSIN IS WELL THERE'S A SAFETY THAT'S WRITTEN INTO THE SITUATION THAT ALLOWS PEOPL TO LEAN INTO PERHAPS NARRATIVES OR COMPONENTS OF NARRATIVES THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE HOLDING BACK FROM SO THESE ARE POWERFUL COMPOUNDS AND I THINK THE FUTURE OF M DI AMA ASSYSTED PSYCHOTHERAPE FOR A TRAMA IN PARTICULAR IS SHO IS HOLDING GREAT PROMISE AS OF NOW MEANING AT THE TIME OF THE RECORDING THIS PONCAST AGAIN I WANDER REITERATE THAT THESE ARE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE BEING DONE LEGALLY THESE DRUGS ARE STILL ELEGAL TO POSSESS OR CELL A OUTSIDE OF CLINICAL TRIALS A DOING THE SORT OF THING IS THE UPUNISHABLE A BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THE F T A AND SOME OF THE RELATED BODIES A THAT ARE THAT CONTROL THESE SORTS OF THINGS OR EYES OPEN TO THE STUFF AND I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS THINGS LIKE M DI AMA AND CERTAINLY CEDAMIN AS ALREADY O IN WIDESPREAD USE WITHIN THE PSYCHIATRIC COMMUNITY AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING A LOT MORE OF THAT ONE THING WE HAVE NOT TOUCHED ON YET IS HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOURE TROMATIZED HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAV CHRONIC FEAR OR A DIBILITATING FEAR NOW MUCH OF THE PSYCHIATRIC COMMUNITY FOCUS IS ON HOW MANY OTHER PROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW TROUBLE SLEEPING A TROUBLE EATING TROUBLE MAINTAINING QUALITY WORK OR SCHOOLWORK AND SO FORTH AND ALL OF THOSE ARE CERTAINLY VERY VALID CRITERIA NECESSARY CRITERIOR FOR DETERMINING WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY MEETS A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OR NOT BUT THERE'S A BIOLOGICAL COMPONENT THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL ASSESS FOR OURSELVES AND THAT'S ONE OF INTERRECEPTIVE VERSES EXTERECEPTIVE BALANCE AND THAT SOUNDS CONFUSING BUT ITS ACTULY REALLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND WE CAN FOCUS OUR PERCEPTION ON THE EXTERNAL WORLD EVENTS GOING ON AROUND US BEYOND THE CONFONDS OF OUR SKIN OR WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR SKIN A FOCUS AND A PERCEPTION ON THE EXTERNAL WORLD IS WHAT'S CALLED IN EXTEROCEPTION AND A FOCUS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE US IS INTEROCEPTION AND WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BUILD MENTAL APPRASAL INTO THAT RIGHT I CAN FOR INSTANCE STOP FOR A MOMENT AND ASSESS HOW MY STOMIC FEELS HOW HUNGRY I FEEL HOW QUICK MY HEART IS BEATING SOME PEOPLE BY THE WAY ARE MUCH BETTER AT SENSING WHETHER R NOT THEIR HEART IS BEATING AT A PARTICULAR RATE AND OTHERS NOT SO MUCH SOME PEOPLE CAN ACHY COUNT THEIR HEART BEATS WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE THEIR PULSE BY PRPLACING PRESSURE ON THEIR RIST OR THEIR NECK SOME PEOPLE CAN'T ANOTHER WHIRD SOME PEOPLE HAVE VERY HIGH INTERRACEPTIVE AWARENESS AND OTHER PEOPLE LESS SO THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF FEAR AN TRAMA RELATES TO TAKING EXTERNAL EXPERIENCES AND FUNNLING THOSE EXPERIENCES INTO THIS THING THAT I'M CALLING A THREAT REFLEX OR THE FEAR CIRCUITRY A RECENT PAPER PUBLISH IN THE JERNAL SCIENCE SO ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR JOURNAL SCIENCE NATURE AND SELL BEING THE APEX JOURNALS OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING GETS AT THIS ISSUE OF WERE IN OUR MIND AND HOW DO WE ASCESS WHETHER NOT WHAT WE ARE FEELING INTERNALLY IS REASONABLE GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON EXTERNALLY AND IT'S O REALLY FASCINATING STUDY I'M JUST GON HIGH LIGHT A LITTLE BIT OF IT AFOR YOU AN THEN I'LL TOUCH ON SOME OF THE RELEVANT ASPECTS AND HOW THAT CAN BE ADOPTED INTO A PRACTICE TO A SESS AND REDUCE FEAR AND ANXIETY THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER PUBLISHD JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO IN SCIENCE IS FEAR BALANCE IS MAINTAINED BY BODILY FEED BACK TO THE INSULAR QUARTEX IN MICE WE'VE NOT TALKED TOO MUCH ABOUT THE INSULA ALSO CALL THE INSULAR QUARTAX THIS IS A BRAINARY THAT MY LAVE AS WORKED ON AND OTHER LABS HAVE WORKED ON IT'S A BRAINAREA THAT HAS WITHIN IT A MAP OF OUR INTERNAL INTERACEPTIVE LANDSCAPE IT'S A MAP OF OUR INTERNAL BODILY SENSATIONS AND SO REALLY INTERESTING STRUCTURE SO THE WAY THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IS THAT SUBJECTS WERE TAUGHT OR CONDITION TO A PARTICULAR DANGER SIGNAL THROUGH REPEATED PRESENTATION OF A SOUND WITH A FOOTSHOCK SO THERE'S A SOUND AND THERE'S A FOOTSHOCK AND AS YOU KNOW FROM OUR EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT PAVALOVIAN LEARNING CONDITIONS STIMULAN UNCONDITIONS STIMULLY EVENTUALLY THE SOUND ALONE COMES TO EVOKE THE FEAR RESPONSE AND THAT'S JUST CLASSIC CLASSICAL CONDITIONING THE INSULA IS THIS BRAIN AREA THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH DETERMINING WHETHER NOT ONE'S INTERNAL SENSATIONS GOT HEART LONGS ET CETERA OUR REASONABLE OR NOT GIVEN THE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES IT CAN EVEN MEASURE OR IS ASSOCIATE WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ARE CALLED ATRIAL BARRL RECEPTORS THESE ARE BLOOD PRESSUR CENSOR SO PLEVE OR NOT WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR PULSERATE INCREASES YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR STRESSED OUT YOUR ATRAL BARREL RECEPTORS ARE SENDING A SIGNAL TO YOUR INSOLAR QUARTEX IN YOUR INSULAR QUARTIX AS SAYING WHILE I AM REALLY STREST OUT MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS UP LYE YOU DON'T ACT YOU HAVE TO MEASURE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH A COUGH YOUR INSULA AS DOING IT FOR YOU IT'S NOT GETTING A QUANITATIVE READOUBT BUT IT'S GETTING A QUALITATIVE READOUT THE MAIN EFFECT OF INHIBITING OR REDUCING THE AC IVITY OF THE INSULA WAS THAT THE INTENSITY OF AN OUTSIDE WORLD EXPERIENCE LED TO A RANGE OF DIFFERENT INTERNAL EFFECTS IN OTHER WORDS FOR MOST PEOPLE A MILD SHOCK WOULD INDUCE A MILD INCREASE IN HEART RATE A MILD INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE WHREAS AN INTENSE SHOCK TO THE SKIN WOULD LEAD TO A BIG INCREASE IN HEART RATE AND A BIG INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE TURNS OUT THE INSULA IS IMPORTANT FOR ESTABLISHING THAT MATCH OF INTENSITY AND WHEN THE INSULA IS INHIBITED WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT A MILD SHOCK CAN CREATE A BIG INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND THAT CAN BE MAINTAINED SUCH THAT ANYTHING THAT'S PARED WITH THAT SHOCK LIKE A BELL OR OR A A TONE WOULD LEAD TO A BIG INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN EXAMPLES OF THIS IN THE REAL WORLD MAYBE THIS IS EVEN YOU SOME PEOPLE OUR VERY JUMPY IN RESPONSE TO JUST EVEN SMALL CHANGES IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT SO OF SOMEBODY'S WORKING AND YOU WALK IN AND YOU SAY HILLO AND THE AND THE KTHEIR JUMPY THEY HAVE A ALOW THRESHOLD TO A BIG ANXIETY OR FEAR RESPONSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE REALLY CALL I RECALL MY MY BULL DOG INFORTENG HE PASSED AWAY BUT BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY IF YOU WALKED IN THE ROOM AND YOU SAID HAKE OSTELLO HE MIGHT TURN HIS EYES IN YOUR DIRECTION HE ADD A VERY HIGH THRESHOLD TO RESPOND HE WAS PRETTY LOW ANXIETY ANIMAL LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT YOU COME UP BEHIND SO WHEN YOU SAY HILLO AND THEY JUST TURN AROUND REAL SLOW OR THEY MIGHT TURN AROUND AT NORMAL SPENCE A HILLO WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE JUMP OUT OF THEIR SEAT THE INSULA SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED IN CALIBRATING HOW BIG OR HIGH HOW HIGH AMPLITUDE A GIVEN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE IS SO IT'S PARRING THE INTERNAL LANDSCAPE WITH THE EXTERNAL WORLD AND THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE JUST A MECHANISTIC BUT NONACTIONABLE POINT BUT WHAT YOU'LL SEE FROM THE NEXT STUDY THAT I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE IS THAT RECALIBRATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUTSIDE EVENTS AN INTERNAL RESPONSIS WHICH IS THE JOB OF THE INSULA IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S UNDER OUR CONTROL AND THROUG A VERY SIMPLE VERY SHORT PROTOCALL WE CAN ACTUALLY RECALIBRATE THAT SYSTEM SO MUCH SO THAT WE CAN POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FEAR INTRAMA THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN RESPONSE TO A MEMORY OR TO A REAL EVENT AND THE ENTIRE PROCESS CAN OCCUR VERY QUICKLY SOM REALLY EXCITED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS NEXT STUDY FOR NUMBER REASONS FIRST OF ALL IT'S EXTREMELY RECENT SECOND OF ALL ITS VERY WELL GROUNDED IN OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS OF STRESS TRAMA AND PITIAST AND UNLEARNING OF STRESSTRAMA AMD PITAST AND THIRD IT POINTS TO A ACTIONABLE PROTOCALL THAT WHILE CERTAINLY IS NOT THE ONLY APPROACH THAT I THINK PEOPLE COULD OR SHOULD TAKE FOR FEAR TRAMA AND PITIAST IS ONE THAT I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE HIM PLEMENTED INTO THE CLINICAL SETTING VERY SOON IF IT'S NOT HAPPENING ALREADY NOW  THERE'S A FOURTH REASON ON VERY INTERESTED IN IT WHICH IS THAT MY LAB WORKS ON STRESS STRESS RELIEF AN TOOLS FOR A MANAGING SLEEP AND IMPROVING FOCUS ET CETERA AND ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF THE STUDIES WE'VE BEEN A DOING LATELY IS VERY BRIEF FIVE MINUTES A DAY INTERVENTIONS OF THE SORT THAT WERE WAS USED IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY ALTHOUGH I SHOULD EMPASIZE ID NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS PARTICULAR STUDY NOW THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN AND ANIMAL MODEL IN MICE THE WORK IN MY LABORATORY FOCUSIS ON HUMAN SUBJECTS BUT THE SIMILARITIES OF THE STRESS SYSTEM AT LEAST AT THE LEVEL THAT IT WAS EXPLORED IN THE STUDY I THINK HAVE GREAT RELEVANTS MAY BE EVEN DIRECT RELEVANTS UT TO HUMANS SO THE TITLE OF THIS STUDY IS REPEATED EXPOSURE WITH SHORT TERM BEHAVIORAL STRESS RESOLVES PRE EXISTING STRESS INDUCED DEPRESSIVE LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE AGAIN THE STUDY WAS IN MCE AND BASELY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY STRESSED OUT MICE GOT THEM DEPRESSED AND YOU ASHLY CAN DO THAT IN AMOUSE A USING A RESTRAINT PROTOCAL AND THAT'S A LONG LASTING RESTRAINT PROTOCAL OF FIFTEEN MINUTES OR MORE MICE DON'T LIKE IT YOU DO IT OFTEN ENOUGH THEY STOP WORKING SO HARD IN  THEIR LIFE IN THEIR MOUTE LIFE TO GAIN FOOD TO GAIN MATES A THEY SHOW DEPRESSIVE SYMPTEMS AND NUMBER OF LEVELS THEY SHOW ELEVATED LUCOCORTOQUOITES YOU SEE THE SAME THING IN HUMANS OF ICHRONIC STRESS IN HUMANS A LASTING IN A WEEKS OR MORE DOES THE SAME EXACT THING SO AGAIN A VERY CLOSE MATCH HERE OMIN TERMS OF MECHANISM OVER ALL AND THEN WHAT THEY DID WAS A VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE THING RATHER THAN GIVE THESE ANIMALS A STRESS RELIEF AT THE LEVEL OF YOU KNOW REDUCING THEIR ANXIETY WITH BENZODIAZOPENS OR GIVING THEM A NICE LITTLE MOUSE VACATION OR WER ENHANCED IN A ERE ENRICHED ENVIRONMENT THINGS THAVE BEEN DONE IN A LOT OF PREVIOUS STUDIES WHAT THEY DID AS THEY SUBJECTED THEM TO FIVE MINUTES TO DAY OF INTENSE STRESS BUT ONLY FIVE MINUTES A DAY AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS MIRACULOUSLY BUT ALSO VERY CONVINCINGLY DAILY SHORT BOUBTS OF INTENSE STRESS ACTUALLY UNDID REVERSED THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS AND IT DID THIS AT THE LEVEL OF LUCOCORTOCOIDS OF HORMONES OF NOR TRANSMITTERS AND NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFERENT MECHANISMS NOW I FIND THIS VERY EXCITING FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE MY LABORATORY IN COLLABORATION WITH DAVID SPEAKLES LABORATORY ARE ASSOCIATURE OF PSYCOTRATE STAMFORD BEEN EXPLORING HOW FIVE MINUTE TA DAY RESPIRATION PROTOCALS CAN ALLEVIATE STRESS AND WHILE THOSE DATE ARE NOT YET PUBLISHED A THEY ARE AT THE STAGE WHERE I'M COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT THEM AND WE ARE SEEN THEM VERY IMPRESSIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON STRESS REDUCTION NOT JUST FROM RESPIRATION PROTOCALS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO CALM THEMSELVES BUT ALSO RESPIRATION PROTOCALS THAT BRING PEOPLE INTO A HEIGHTENE STATE OF AUTONOMIC SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL A C A STRESS AS MY COLLIGUE DOCTOR DAVID'S BEGLE E'S AN EMDY PSYCATRIST AND PCT LIKES TO SAY WHEN IT COMES TO TRAMA ANXIETY AND PT ST AND THE TREATMENT OF TROM ANXIETY IN P T ST IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE THAT YOU ARE IN OR THAT YOU GO INTO IT'S HOW YOU GOT THERE AND WHETHER NOT YOU HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT AND THIS BRINGS US RIGHT BACK TO THOSE TOP DOWN MECHANISMS AND THE NARRATIVE AROUND WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING INTERNALLY SO LET'S THEZUME OUT AND I'LL EXPLAIN HOW THIS WORKS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT WE HAVE THIS BRAIN STRUCTURE CALLED THE INSULA WE TALKED BY THE INSUL A FEW MINUTES AGO THE INSULA IS CALIBRATING HOW WE FEEL INTERNALLY VERSES WHAT'S GOING ON EXTERNALLY IT'S INVOLVED IN SETTING WHETHER NOT WHAT WE ARE FEELING IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT CAN GENERATE THREAT RESPONSES END IN THE CASE OF TROMAP T ST AN EXTREME STRESS CRONIC STRESS THAT SYSTEM GETS RAMPED UP SO THAT IT TAKES VERY LITTLE MAYBEVEN JUST A MEMORY OR MAYBE VEN A AN ASSOCIATION THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF YOU KNOW OUR LOCATION TRIGGER SOMETHING WER NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT AND WE START EXPERIENCING THAT SYMPTOMOLOGY HOW DO WE RECALIBRATE THE SYSTEM WELL MOST OF THE APPROACHES THAT ARE OUT THERE INVOLVING DRUG TREATMENTS TYPICAL DRUG TREATMENTS WOULD INVOLVE SUPPRESSING THE LEVEL OF INTERNAL AROUSAL JUST TRYN TO BRING THAT DOWN NOW SOME OF THOSE STRUG TREATMENTS WORK BUT OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S PROBABLY NOT SURPRISING THAT THEY DON'T BECAUSE BY TAKING A DRUG THAT JUST LOWERS YOUR ANXIETY OVER ALL YOURE CREATING A DIFFERENT SORT OF MISCALIBRATION OF THE SYSTEM SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN HUMAN SUBJECTS IS HAVING THEM DO EITHER BREATHING PROTOCALS THAT COMTHEM AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS IN A MOMENT OR DOING BREATHING PROTOCALS THAT INCREASE THE LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND SEEING HOW THAT IMPACTS THEIR RESPONSE DISTRESS OVER ALL NOT JUST DURING THAT PARTICULAR BREATHING PROTOCOL SO THE CALMING PROTOCOL THAT THAT WE USE INVOLVES THES OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE HI'VE TALKED ABOUT THESE UM PREVIOUSLY ON THE PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE BUT IF UM YOU JUST NEED A REMINDER IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT THERE'S A PATTERN OF BREATHING THAT WE ALL DO IN SLEEP WHEN OUR CARBONDOXIDE LEVELS IN OUR BLOODSTREAM GET TOO HIGH AND WE DO THIS WHEN WE GET CLOSTROPHOBIC MEANING WE DO IT REFLECTIVELY AND THAT'S A DOUBLE INHAIL THROUGH THE NOSE FOLLOWED BY A LONG EXHAILS SO IT'S AND YES THET INHALES SHOULD BE THROUGH THE NOSE AND YAST THE EXHAILES SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE MOUTH IDEALLY SO IT'S A BIG FILLING OF THE LUNGS THROUGH TWO BREATHS BACK TO BACK IN INHALES EVEN IF YOU COU DON'T LE SNEAK IN A LITTLE AIR ON THAT SECOND ONE NO TALKING IF YOU GING TO DO A RIGHT AND THEN A LONG EXHAIL WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO OFFLOATD A LOT OF CARBONOXIDE IN THE EXILE AND WE HAVE PEOPLE DOING THAT IN REAL TIME ANYTIME THEY EXPERIENCE STRESS BUT THE PARTICULAR BREATHING PROTOCOL THAT WE BEEN GIVING HUMAN SUBJECTS IS FOR THEM TO DO THE THE REPEATED SIC WHAT WE CALL SICLIC SIING SO DOUBL LINHALE EXILE DUBLINHAL EXILE DUBLIN HAL EXELE REPEATEDLY FOR FIVE MINUTES WHICH ASUE A PRETTY LONG TIME TO REPEAT THAT BUT YOU CAN DO IT PRETTY SLOWLY AND PEOPLE REPORT AND THE DATEA POINT TO THE FACK THAT IT'S VERY CALMING PEOPLE FEEL MORE RELAXED AFTERWARDS AND THAT RELAXATION WIKS OUT INTO OTHER OF ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE NOW WE DID NOT LOOK AT STRESS AND TROMA IN THAT CONDITION WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER CONDITION WHERE PEOPLE DO WHAT'S CALLED SYCLIC HY PREVENTILATION WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT AND CREATES A VERY DIFFERENT INTERNAL STATE AND IS SOMEWHAT STRESSFUL ITS FIVE MINUTES A DAY OF STRESS MUCH LIKE THE STUDY THAT I JUST JUST DESCRIBE AND INVOLVES BASICALLY DOING THIS OF WHAT I'LL DO IN A MOMENT OF FOR FIVE MINUTES WHICH IS I PEROVENTILATING WHICH IS    BUT NOT CONTINUOUSLY FOR THE FIVE MINUTES BECAUS OF MANY PEOPLE WOULD PASS OUT OR FEEL EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE IT INVOLVES INHALE EXILE INHALE EXIL VERY DEEP INHAL THROUGH THE NOSE EXSEL THROUGH THE MOUTH AND THEN EVERY TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREATHS OR SO DOING A FULL EXILE AND HOLDING ONE'S BREATH LUNGS EMPTY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MAY BE THIRTY MAY BEVEN SIXTY SECONDS AND THEN CONTINUING UNTIL FIVE MINUTES IS UP SUBJECTS REPORT AND AR DATA INDICATE THAT PEOPLE FEEL A HEIGHTEND LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUS ON FACT I CAN FEEL IT RIGHT NOW EVEN FROM THAT VERY BRIEF A SYCLIC HYPEROVENTILATION BOUT I JUST DID YOU FEEL A HEATING UP YOU FEEL A OF O SOME PEOPLE PERSPIRE SOME PYOU WLL GET WIDE EYED SOME PEOPLE FEEL AGITATED THAT'S A DRENOLINE BEING RELEASED INTO YOUR SYSTEM NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING EVERYONE RUN OUT AND DO THIS AND IF YOU EVER PREDISPOSITION TO PANIC ATTACK OR ANXIETY ATTACKS PLEASE DON'T DO THIS BECAUSE IT IS VERY STIMULATING AND CAN TRIGGER THOSE SORTS OF ATTACKS BUT THIS FIVE MINUTE A DAY PROTOCAL OF SICLIC HIBEROVINTILATION DOES LEAD TO BIG INCREASES ANONONOMIC ROUSAL SO ITIS IT'S STRESSFUL IN AIR QUOTES BUT TO BRING US BACK TO THE O MY COLLEAGUE DAVIDSPEAGLES O QUOTE IT REALLY WAS HIM THAT SAID IT NOT ME IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE STATE THAT YOU'RE IN IT'S ABOUT THE STATE THAT YOU'RE IN PLUS HOW YOU GOT THERE AND WHETHER NOT YOU DIRECTED ENTRY INTO THAT STATE AND THAT POINT OF THAT ONE DIRECTS THEIR OWN ENTRY INTO A STATE DELIBERATELY IS REALLY KEY AND I THINK HAS AN IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR WEATHER OR NOT THEIR STRESS RELIEF AND FEAR RELIEF AND TROMER RELIEF FROM BRINGING ONESELF INTO A STATE OF INCREASED AUTONOMIC AROUSAL WHY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THAT FEAR AND TROMICIRCUITRY IS ORGANIZED IF YOU RECALL IT'S GOT THESE COMPONENTS OF HOW EXTERNAL EVENTS CAN TRIGGER AND INTERNAL STRESS RESPONSE AND FEAR RESPONSE AND TROMA RESPONSE BUT THERE'S THAT TOP DOWN PREFRONTAL COMPONENT THAT CAN INHIBIT CERTAIN COMASPECTS OF THAT FEAR AND THREAT CIRCUITRY NOW EARLIER WE RE TALKING ABOUT THAT PREFRONTAL CIRCUIT BEING ENGAGED THROUGH NARRATIVE THROUGH SELF DIRECTED DELIBERATE NARRATIVE IT'S THE PERSON DELIBERATELY RETELLING THE STORY HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DELIBERATE REACTIVATION OF THE SENSATIONS IN THE BODY SO WHERE I THINK THIS IS ALL GOING MEANING WHERE MY LABORATORY IN THE SPEAGAL LABORATORY AND OTHER LABORATORIES OUT THERE AR TAKING THIS IS YOU CAN IMAGIN A VERY BRIEF FIVE MINUTES A DAY TWO WEEKS WAS THE TIME THAT THEY DID THIS FOR FIVE MINTS A DAY FOR TWO WEEKS INTERVENTION IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH THE SUPPORT OF A CLINITION WE WOULD HOPE WOULD DELIBERATELY INDUCE A PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE THAT'S VERY STRESSFUL MI NOT SHYING AWAY FROM THE STRESS RESPONSE BUT INCREASING THEIR OWN STRESS RESPONSE DELIBERATELY AND MAY BE INCONJUNCTION WITH RECOUNTING THE TRAMATIC OR FEARFUL CIRCUMSTANCE THIS IS FAR AND AWAY DIFFERENT THAN THE KIND OF STATE OF MIND AND BODY THAT WOULD COME ABOUT IN ACEDAMINE ASSISTED TRAMAN DU PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION OR A EMDIAMA ASSISTED TRAMA PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION OR IN A NEVER PURELY NARRATIVE BASED PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION AIMED AT ALLEVIATING FEAR OR TRMA THE REASON I LIKE THESE SORTS OF INTERVENTIONS IS THAT A THEY ARE VERY LOW COST OR EVEN ZERO COST RIGHT ONE COULD YOU COULD IMAGION I'M DOING THIS WHILE JOURNALANG OR A WHILE RECOUNTING A PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE AGAIN THEIRE VERY COMPACT FIVE MINUTES A DAY FOR TWO WEEKS IS WHAT WAS DONE IN THIS PARTICULAR MOUSE STUDY WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT TRANSLATES DIRECTLY TO THE HUMAN STUDY OR NOT WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT IF THEY USED A LONGER DAILY BOUTS OF STRESS LIKE FIFTEEN MINUTES TO DAY THAT ACTUALLY EXASCERBATED THE TRAMA AND EXASCERBATED THE FEAR SO ONE HAS TO BE VERY CAREFUL STRESS AND DELIBERATE ENTRY INTO STRESS AND SELF STRESSING ARE VERY POTENT TOOLS THEIR VERY SHARP BLADES THAT IT DOES APPEAR OR IT'S LIKELY CAND HOW BALLEVIATE TRAMA AND FEAR BUT HOW LONG TO DO THIS EXACTLY WHAT THE PROTOCAL SHOULD BE AS STILL SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CULTIVATED I KNOW THERE CAN BE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT NONE THE LESS OURE GOING TO WON TO EXPERIMENT WITH SOME OF THIS I WILL SAY THAT I DO NOT THINK IT MATTERS HOW ONE GETS INTO THAT STRESSE STATE PROVIDED IT IS SELF DIRECTED AND THAT THEREFORE COULD BE CULCHAWER IT COULD BE ICE BATH IT COULD BE O ANYTHING THAT INDUCES AN ACUTE MEANING A SUDDEN ONSET OM OF A DRENNOLIN AND IS SELF DIRECTED THAT'S REALLY THE KEY FEATURE HERE SOME VERY EXCITED ABOUT THESE DATA BOTH THE FIVE MINN INTERVENTION DATA FROM THE ANIMAL STUDY THE WORK THAT'S ON GOING IN MY LABORATORY IN DOCTOR SPEAGLES LABORATORY AND THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE ON THE INSULA BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WERE STARTING TO SEE NOW IS A PICTURE OF FEAR AND TRAMA AMPITIASTI THAT HAS THI SENSORY COMPONENT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AROUND US THIS INTERNAL AND TERACEPTIVE COMPONENT YOU KNOW HOW APPROPRIATE ARE THE SIGNALS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN MY BODY I MENLETS FACE IT  YOU ALMOST GET BY A CAR IN YOUR HEART RAD IS YIN A HUNDRED FORTY BEATS PER SECOND AND THAT LAST FOR A LITTLE WHILE IN YOUR STRESSED OUT YOU DON'T GET THE BEST NIGHT SLEEP THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL THAT MEANS YOUHAVE A HEALTHY FIERC SYSTEM IF THAT PERSISTS IN YOURS DEALING WITH A LOT OF ISSUES A WEEK LATER SIX WEEKS LATER TO YEARS LATER THEN IT'S MOVED INTO THE REALM OF TRAMA AND PITIISTI SO WE NEED TO ALWAYS BE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE CIRCUITRY I DO THINK THAT DELIBERATE SELF DIRECTED ENTRY INTO THESE SHORT BOUTS OF STRESS IS A VERY PROMISING APPROACH AND IT'S ONE THAT IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EXPERIMENT I JUST AGAIN ON A CAUTION PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY OR PANIC DISORDERS BE VERY CAUTIOUS PROBABLY DON'T DO IT IDEALLY YOU WOULD DO THIS INCONJUNCTION WITH SUPPORT FROM A CLINITION BUT I AM ALSO WARE THAT THERE ARE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE DEALING WITH TRAMA AND DEALING WITH POSTRAMATIC STRESS OF VARIOUS KINDS AND THAT THEIR DESPERATE FOR A VARIOUS SELF DIRECTED INTERVENTION APPROACHES SO JUST VERY BRIEFLY I WANT A TOUCH ON SOME OF THE LIFE STYLE AND SUPPLEMENTATION FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT THINGS LIKE FEAR AND TRAMA AND GETTING OVER FEAR AND TRAMA TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE ALL CANOND SHOULD DO TO SUPPORT OUR OVER ALL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND THESE ARE THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS OF QUALITY NUTRITION WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU A QUALITY SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS AMPLE SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS WE HAVE AN EPISODED ON HOW TO MASTER SLEEP IN BAT WIAFOUR EPISODES THAT YOU CAN GO TO HUBERMAN LABDO CALM OR ELSEWHERE AND SCROLL DOWN AND AM YOU CAN FIND THOSE EPISODES IN ORDER TO GET YOUR SLEEP REALLY DILED IN AS THEY SAY IF YOURE SLEEPING REGULARLY AND FOR SUFFICIENT DURATION ALL OF THE SYSTEMS OF YOUR FEAR CIRCUITRY ARE GOING TO FUNCTION BETTER MAINLY BECAUSE THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BECOMES VERY DISREGULATED WHEN WE ARE NOT GETTING GOOD SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS DISREGULATED MEANS THAT OUT OF NOWHERE WE CAN HAVE A HIGHER PROPENSITY TO HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION OR WE CAN FEEL REALLY TIRED AND WIRED YOU THAT SEESAW THAT IT ASCRIBED EARLIER OF ALERTNESS AND CALMNESS OF SYMPATHETIC AND PARIS SYMPATHETIC IN THAT ANALOGY WE CAN IMAGINE THAT SEASAW HAS A HAS A HINGE AND THAT HINGE CAN NEITHER BE TOO TIGHT NOR TO LOOSE IF IT'S TOO TIGHT YOU CAN GET LOCKED INTO CRONIC ACTIVATION OF ALERTNESS OR CHRONIC FATIGUE IF IT'S TO LOOSE YOUR BOUNCING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND YOU MIGHT BEEL TIRED AND WIRED ONE MOMENT AND THEN YOU KNOW REALLY HYPER ALERT SLEEP RESETS THAT BALANCES AND RESETS THAT HINGE TO THE APPROPRIATE TIGHTNESS IF YOU WILL SO THAT ALL THESE CIRCUITS AND NOT JUST THE CIRCUITS RELATED TO FEAR BUT ALSO THE CIRCUITS RELATE TO COGNITION CLEAR THINKING TO BE ABLE TO A SPELL OUT VERY CLEAR DETAILED NARRATIVES TO FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN CONTROL YOU ARE DELIBERATELY BRINGING YOURSELF INTO THESE PROTOCALLS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU INTEND TO USE ALL OF THAT FUNCTIONS MUST MUCH BETTER WHEN YOUR SLEEPING WELL AND EATING WELL WE TALKED ABOUT SOCIAL CONNECTION THOSE ARE ALL INDIRECT SUPPORTS OF TROMER RELIEF AND OF GETTING OVER FEAR BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL O CAY I THINK OF THEM SORT OF LIKE THE TIDE A WHEN THE TIDE IS HIGH ENOUGH A BOAT CAN LEAVE HARBOR AND IF THE TIDE IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH THAN THAT BOAT IS GOING TO BE STRANDED ON SHORE AND IN THIS ANALOGY THE BOAT STRANDED ON SHORE IS YOUR ATTEMPT OR ANYBODIES ATTEMPT TO TRY AND WORK THROUGH SOMETHING VERY HARD TO DO WHEN WE'RE SLEEP DEPRIVED VERY HARD TO DO WHEN WE'RE NOT A FED ENOUGH OR FED THE PROPER FOODS A FOR YOU AND THAT'S A HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL THING AND SOCIAL CONNECTION AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER CREATES A GENERAL SENSE OF SUPPORT FOR THE ABILITY TO MOVE THROUGH THINGS BUT ALSO CHEMICAL SUPPORT AT THE LEVEL OF SUPPRESSING TACTIKINAN O CASE OF THOSE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY KEY BUT THEY ARE INDIRECT I JUST ONE OF BRIEFLY MENTION A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT SOME PEOPLE FIND GREAT BENEFIT FROM IN THE SUPPLEMENTATION REALM AS IT RELATES TO ANXIETY STRESS FEAR AND PITIAST BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AGAIN THESE ARE SOMEWHAT INDIRECT IN THEIR SUPPORT AND MOST OF THEM FOCUS ON REDUCING ANXIETY OVER ALL A THE TWO THAT I WANT A FOCUSON ARE TWO THAT HAVE NEVER TALKED ABOUT ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE A BECAUSE OV DON PODCASTS BEFORE ON STRESS IN MANAGING STRESS IN THE KIND OF SHORTER TERM SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR CHORGONDA IN A PREVIOUS PODCAST CHECK OUT THE THE PODCAST ON ON STRESS IF A IF YOUREINTERESTED IN A HOW THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT AS WELL AS OTHER TOOLS BUT THE TWO ARE INTERESTING ONES A THE FIRST ONE IS SAFFRON OF ALL THINGS A BUT IT THERE ARE TWELVE STUDIES BELIEVE OR NOT THAT EARLY INGESTED SAFFRON AT THIRTY MELIGRAMS A SEEMS TO BE A RELIABLE DOSE FOR REDUCING ANXIETY A ON THE STANDARD INVENTORIES THE HAMILTON ANXIETY RATING SCALE FOR THOSE WE THAT WONT TO KNOW AND THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS AND THESE WERE CARRIED OUT IN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE SUBJECTS ALWAYS HERE UM ONLY REFERRING TO HUMAN STUDIES A SEVERAL OF THESE WERE DOUBLE BLIND STUDIES THERES A A METANALYSIS OF THE A POSITIVE EFFECTS  MEANING A ANXXILIOTIC EFFECTS ANXIETY REDUCING EFFECTS THAT IS OF THINGS LIKE SAFFRON DEFFULLY AF TO CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR MAKE SURE ITS RIHTE FOR YOU BUT THET THE FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE A A FACTS WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT A GIVEN THAT THESE ARE LEGAL OVER THE COUNTER A SUBSTANCES AGAIN CHECK WITH A DOCTOR THE OTHER ONE IS A NOCITAL A A NOCITAL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO CREATE A VERY NOTABLE DECREASE IN ANXIETY SYMPTOMS A IT'S A FAIRLY HIGH DOSE THAT'S USE BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT A THE POTENCY OF THIS EFFECT IS ON PAR WITH MANY OF THE PRESCRIPTION AND TO DEPRESSENCE THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE A THESE STUDIES AGAIN ARE DOUBLE BLIND STUDIES THAT A ALL SHOWED DECREASES IN ANXIETY ON THESE WERE DONE IN MALES AND FEMALES THE AGE RANGES VERY BROAD WHICH IS GREAT EIGHTEEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SIXTY FOR AACROSS THE STUDIES THAT I LOOKED AT A ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT A THE DOSAGES ARE QUITE HIGH EIGHTEEN GRAMS OOF A NOCITAL TAKEN FOR A FULL MONTH AND IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME M FOR THESE A SYMPTEMS OF ANXIETY TO A TO TO BE IMPROVED A THE LOW DOSE RANGE WAS YOU KNOW ABOUT TWELVE GRAMS OF A NOCITAL SO AS HIGHA EIGHTEEN AS LOW AS TWELVE GRAMS A BUT THEN AGAIN PRETTY IMPRESSIVE RESULTS CONSIDERING THAT THESE ARE OVER THE COUNTER A SUPPLEMENT SUPPLEMENT COMPOUNDS A THERE'S EVEN SOME EVIDENCE I SHOULD JUST MENSION THAT THE ANOCITALS ALSO USEFOR FOR THINGS LIKE A OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER WE WILL DO A FULL EPISODE ON OS D IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT A BUT IN THE MEANTIME NOCITAL DOES SEEM TO HAVE SOME PAUSIVE EFFECTS ON A ANXIETY AND THEREFORE MIGHT PROVIDE A CAND OF SUPPORTIVE INDIRECT EFFECT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH TRAMA AND PIT ST NOW THE QUESTION IS WHEN WOULD YOU TAKE IT WELL BY THE LOGIC OF WHAT WE SPELLED OUT TO DAY YOU PROBABLY WOULD NOT WANT TO TAKE IT DURING A SESTION OR PRIOR TO A SESTION WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO AMPLIFY THE INTENSITY OF AN EXPERIENCE IN THE RECOUNTING OF IT EXPERIENCE IN EFFORTS TO EVENTUALLY EXTINGUISH THAT EXPERIENCE RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT A DRUG OR A COMPOUND OF ANY KIND PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR SUPPLEMENT OR ANY OF ANY KIND INTO YOUR SYSTEM YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY SHORT CIRCUITING THE EXEXTINGUISHING EFFECT RIGHT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE DOING THIS OUTSIDE OF THAT SESSION AS A WAY TO CAN BRING YOUR SYSTEM BACK TO BASELINE PERHAPTS A SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THESE SORTS OF THINGS YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT THEM LOGICALLY ND THIS ALSO REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING OUT THERE TO SELF MEDICATE OVER USE OV ALCAL OR OTHER SUBSTANCES TO TRYING CALM THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY HAVE FEAR ANXIETY IN PT ST ARE ACTUALLY DRIVING THAT FEAR ANXIETY IMPETIOSTY DEEPER INTO THEIR SYSTEM OR AT LEAST IS NOT ALLOWING IT TO RELIEVE ITSELF THROUGH ANY ATTEMPTS TO RECOUNT OR OR REPLAY IN USING THESE TOPDOUN NARRATIVE CIRCUITS OR OTHER APPROACHES AND THE LAST COMPOUND I WANT A MENTION IS A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE IT'S NEITHER IN ANXILIOTIC NOR IS IT SOMETHING THAT INCREASES OVER ALL LEVELS OF STRESS AND ALERTNESS BUT IT HAS SOME KIND OF MDI MA ISH LIKE CONTOUR TO IT IT DOES NOT PRODUCE AS FAR AS WE KNOW THE SAME MENTAL EFFACTS OR PHYSICAL EFFECTS AS EMDIA MAY BY ANY STRETCH A BUT THAT'S THE SUBSTANCE THEM REFERRING TO RATHER IS KAVA KAVA A HAS BEEN SHOWN IN EIGHT STUDIES TO HAVE A VERY POTENT EFFECT ON REDUSING ANXIETY BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT KAVA IS THAT KAVA FUNCTIONS BY INCREASING GABA THIS INHIBITORY NURRO TRANSMITTER IN THE BRAIN REMEMBER GABA IS THE INHIBITORY NURR TRANSMITTERS THAT IS USE THAT'S EMPLOYED BY THE VERY NURONS IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS THAT SERVE TO INHIBIT THE THREAT REFLEX SO IT SEEMS TO INCREASE GABA BUT ALSO INCREASES DOPAMY AND THAT'S A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL COMPOUND I AM NOT AWARE OF MANY COMPOUNDS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE GABA AN INCREASE DOPAMINE AND AS YOU RECALL THAT THREAT REFLEX HAS OUTPUTS THAT TAPPEN TO THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM NOW THAT'S A YOU KNOW A BIG LEAP TO GO FROM A COMPOUND THAT INCREASES GAVAN DOPAMEN AND LOOK AT A CIRCUIT A SPELLED OUT ON PAPER IN FRONT OF US AND SAILE WITH THEIRS GAVAN DOPIMEN IN THE CIRCUIT AND THEREFORE THIS IS A GOOD COMPOUND TO TAKE BUT THE EFFECTS OF KAVA IN HUMAN STUDIES ARE PRETTY INTERESTING AS IT RELATES TO ANXIETY STRESS PETIASTY AND FEAR AM I'M NOT CAN SUMRISE ALL OF THESE BECAUSE THER THEIR EIGHT STUDIES  THAT I'M AWARE OF A BUT I'LL JUST MENTION AGAIN THESE ARE DOUBLE BLIND STUDIES SO THE TRIALD DESIGN IS SOLID THE AGE RANGES ARE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTEEN TO SIXTY FOR WHICH THIS NICE BROAD AGE RANGE THE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS IS IS QUITE HIGH BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AM NO SIGNS OF A HAHEPADATOXIC A SIGNAL SO MEANING A LIVERTOXICITY ALTHOUGH OF COURSE CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT AM AFTER A PERIOD OF ABOUT THREE WEEKS OF TREATMENT WITH ANYWHERE FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MELIGRAMS AM OF WHAT ARE CALLED ACTIVE KAVA LACTONES OCASO THEIRS THEIR DOSAGES THAT RELATE TO THAT KAVA SO A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF EXTRACT OF CAVA IS A KIND OF A REASONABLE TYPICAL DOSE IN THESE STUDIES BUT THAT SPELLS OUT TO AM A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF KAVA LACTONE SO YOU HAVET TO KIND OF A BOIL DOWN TO WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATES DOSAGE AM AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S EXTREMELY BROAD YOU'LL SEE EVIDENCE OF FIFTY MELIGRAMS ILS THE EVIDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS COUN ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT EACH OF THESE STUDIES ALONE AND TOGETHER POINT TO THE FACT THAT KAVA DOES SEEM TO PRODUCE A VERY POTENT ANCILIOTIC AND GENERAL A KIND OF IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND REDUCTION IN GENERALIZED ANXIETY A ACROSS THE BOARD SO IT'S AN INTERESTING COMPOUND I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY TRIED ANY OF THE COMPOUNDS I JUST MENTIONE A KAVA SAFRON A OR A NICITAL A SO I CAN'T REPORT ON THEM PERSONALLY I JUST KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST ARE INTERESTED IN SUPPLEMENTS AND LEGAL OVER THE COUNTER APPROACHES A TO THEIR BIOLOGY AN PSYCHOLOGY AND SO THAT'S WHY MENTION THEM THOSE WETE THE THREE FOR WHICH I FOUND THE MOST CONVINCING EVIDENCE AND THE LARGEST BULK OF EVIDENCE SO IF YOU INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THOSE PROCEED WITH CAUTION BUT AM THEY DO SEEM QUITE INTERESTING SO TODAY WE'VE REVIEWED A LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN AN BODY THAT UNDERLIE THE FEAR RESPONSE AND THAT GIVE RISE TO CHRONIC FEAR AND IN SOME CASES TO TRMA AND PETIASTI WE ALSO TOUCHED ON A LARGE VARIETY OF APPROACHES TO DEALING WITH FEAR TRAMA AND PETIASTI THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OUT THERE I ALSO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE EMERGING THEMES FOR INSTANCE THIS SHORT FIVE MINUTE A DAY DELIBERATE SELF DIRECTED STRESS OF ANY KIND THROUGH RESPIRATION OR OTHER OTHER APPROACHES OF INCREASING A DRANALINE AS AN APPROACH THAT MIGHT BE VIABLE SHOULD EMICIZE MIGHT BEVIABLE FOR ENHANCING THE SPEED OR THE POTENCY OF TREATMENTS TO REDUCE FEAR OR ELIMINATE TRAMA MOST IMPORTANT I BELIEVE IS TO UNDERSTAND AND REALLY THINK ABOUT THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE FEAR AND PITIASTI BECAUSE IN DOING THAT EACH OF US ALL OF US CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF TREATMENTS AND APPROACHES MAKE THE MOST SENSE FOR THEM I ALSO HOPE THAT IT WILL HELP PEOPLE LEAN IN TO CERTAIN PRACTICES INVOLVING RE EXPOSURE PROVIDED THAT'S DONE IN A SUPPORT OF ENVIRONMENT RE EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN TRAMATIC EVENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO EXTINGUISH THAT OBVIOUSLY YO WANT TO DO THAT SAFELY MEANING PSYCHOLOGICALLY SAFELY AND PHYSICALLY SAFELY THEIRE GREAT PRACTITIONERS OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT WORK THERE ALSO NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE I AM CERTAIN THAT ARE CARRYING CERTAIN TRAMAS OR CERTAIN FEARS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ALLEVIATE THAT ARE NOT IN THE EXTREME CLINICAL REALM AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY I TOUCHED ON A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING SOME SELF DIRECTED PRACTICES THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL AND REASONABLE FOR THEM TO EXPLORE I REALIZE WE COVERED A LOT OF INFORMATION TO DAY IF YOU'RE ENJOYING AND OR LEARNING FROM

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LACONCAS  A SCIENCE SCIENCE SPACE TOS FRLIFE I MANDER HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMALGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR MAYA SCHANCARR DOCTOR MAYA SCHANCARR IS A COGNIVE SCIENTIST WHO DID HER UNDERGRADUATE TRAINING AT YALE UNIVERSITY HER P H D THESIS AT OXFORD AS A ROAD SCHOLAR AND A POSTDOCTOR OLFELLOWSHIP ALSO IN COGNIVE SCIENCE AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY DOCTOR SCHANCARR ALSO SERVED AS A SENIOR ADVISER TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND SHE FOUNDIT AND SERVED AS THE CHAIR OF THE WHITE HOUSE BEHAVORAL SCIENCE T DOCTOR SCHANCARR IS ALSO THE HOST OF HER OWN PODCAST ENTITLED A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS AND INDEED DOCTOR SHANCARR HERSELF IS NO STRANGER TO HAVING TO MAKE MAJOR CHANGES TO ONE'S LIFE PLANS AS YOU'LL LEARN TO DAY PRIOR TO ALL THOSE INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT DOCTOR CHANCARR HAS ACHIEVED SHE WAS A STUDENT AT THE JULIARD CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC PREPARING HER LIFE TO BE COME A PROFESSIONAL CONCERT VIOLINIST BUT AS YOU'LL ALSO SOON LEARN SHE THEN EXPERIENCED A CAREER DEVASTATING INJURY FORCING HERSELF TO HAVE TO REFRAME EVERYTHING ABOUT HER LIFE PLANS AND HER OWN IDENTITY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE TALK ABOUT TO DAY WE TALK ABOUT IDENTITY DOCTUSS DOCTOR SCHANCARR'S PRIOR AND CURRENT IDENTITIES BUT OF COURSE YOUR IDENTITY WE POSE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS GEAR TOWARD GETTING YOU TO ASK WHO AM I REALLY DO MY GOALS A LINE WITH WHO I AM AND WHAT I WANT DOCTOR CHANCARR SHARES WITH US THE RESEARCH ON IDENTITY GOALS MOTIVATION AND PLANS AS WELL AS MANY PRACTICAL TOOLS TO ANSWER THOSE KEY QUESTIONS THAT GUIDE US DOWN EITHER THE CORRECT OR INCORRECT TRAJECTORIES IN LIFE SHE SHARES WITH US FOR INSTANCE HOW TO ASSESS ON PAPER GOALS OF THE SORT THAT YOU OULD SEE ON A C V SO WHICH SCHOOL WHICH JOB WHICH SALARY WHICH SPOUS ET CETERA ET CETERA AND HOW TO RELATE THOSE TO THE DEEPER FEELINGS THAT RELATE TO ONE'S ABILITY TO CONTIN NEWLY PURSUE A GIVEN GOAL KNOWING THAT IT'S THE RIGHT GOAL FOR US WE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF FEELINGS WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT TELL US AND WHEN THEY SHOULD OR SHANOT SERVE AS A COMPASS FOR GUIDING OUR EVERY DAY AND LONGER TERM DECISIONS BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL REALIZE THAT DOCTOR SCHANCARR IS ESSENTIALLY HANDING YOU A SCIENCE SUPPORTED ROAD MAP FOR HOW TO DETERMINE AN ACCESS YOUR IDENTITY AND GOALS AND HOW ONE INFLUENCES THE OTHER THAT IS HOW YOUR IDENTITY INFLUENCES YOUR GOALS AND HOW YOUR GOALS INFLUENCES YOUR IDENTITY IN BECOMING THE PERSON THAT YOU WANT TO BE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE OF THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS MAWE NEWE VENISON MAW NEWE VENISON IS THE MOST NEUTRIANT DENSE AND DELICIOUS RED MEAT AVAILABLE I'VE SPOKEN BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST IN SOLO EPISODES END WITH GUESS ABOUT THE NEED TO GET APPROXIMATELY ONE GRAM OF HIGH QUALITY PROTEINE PER POUND OF BODY WEIGHT EACH DAY FOR OPTIMAL NUTRITION THER'RE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT ONE CAN DO THAT BUT A KEY THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT BY INJESTING EXCESSIVE CALORIES MWE NEWE VENISON HAS THE HIGHEST DENSITY OF QUALITY PROTEINE PER CALORY AND IT ACHIEVES THAT IN DELICIOUS THINGS LIKE GROUND MEATS TENISON STAKES JERKY AND BONEBROTH I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE GROUND VENISON I MAKE THOSE INTO VENISON BURGERS PROBABLY FIVE TIMES A WEEK OR MORE I ALSO LIKE THE JERKY FOR ITS CONVENIENCE SPECIALLY WHEN I'M TRAVELLING ARE A ESPECIALLY BUSY WITH WORK AND KNOW THAT I'M GETTING AN EXTREMELY NEUTRIENT DENSE HIGH QUALITY SOURCE OF PROTINE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY MWE NEWE VENISON YOU CAN GO TO MAWE NEWE VENISON DOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMAN AND GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER AGAIN THAT'S MAWE NEWE VENISON DOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO A BY EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING WELL END ENOUGH EVERYTHING IN LIFE GOES MUCH BETTER AND WHEN WE AREN'T SLEEPING WELL OR LONG ENOUGH THINGS IN LIFE GET WORSE WE KNOW THAT FROM DATA WE ALL KNOW THAT FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL THINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT NEEDS TO BE SUCH THAT YOUR COOR BODY TEMPERTURE DROPS BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP AND THEN INCREASE BY ONE TO THREE DEGREES IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED IN THE MORNING WITH EIGHT SLEEP SMART MATTRESS COVERS YOU CAN PROGRAM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT SO THAT IT'S IDEALLY MATCH TO YOUR TEMPERATURE NEEDS I STARTED SLEEPING ON IN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT IS COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE QUALITY OF THE SLEEP THAT I GET SO MUCH SO THAT I ACTUALLY LOATHE TRAVELLING BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY IGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER WHEN I TRAVEL IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL SAVE UP TO A HUNDRED N FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U SA CANIDA U C SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR MYA SCHANCAR WELCOME SO HAPPIERE HERE AN FANTER WHAT'S GRATE E HERE I'VE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IDENTITY ABOUT GOALS AND MOTIVATION AND ABOUT CHANGE IN GENERAL BUT I'D LIKE TO START OFF WITH IDENTITY AND  LIKE TO DIVIDED INTO TWO SEGMENTS THE FIRST IS HOW WE FORM AN IDENTITY AND YOU KNOWT WE'LL GET INTO YOUR STORY N I HOPE BIT OR MORE OF DETAIL BUT WHEN WE'RE YOUNGER WE TEN T ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT OURSELVES BUT ALSO ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND US WE WANT A LEARN WHAT OUR PARENTS DO FOR A LIVING AH WHAT THE WORKERS ON THE STREET ARE DOING THAT FOR ET CETERA HOW MUCH OF OUR EARLY IDENTITY DO YOU THINKT IS FORMED BY OBSERVATION OF WHAT WE ARE DOING VERSES OBSERVATION AND LABELS OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AROUND US AN CLOSESTUS YET IT'S A GREAT QUESTION UM I THINK A LOT OF IT IS FASED ON WHAT WE SEE AROUND US AND WHAT WE SEE A IS DEEMED SUCCESSFUL AND AND SOCIETY PRIVILEGES AND THERE'S A CONCEPT CALLED IDENTITY FOR CLOSURE WERE ACTUALLY WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU'RE OBSERVING WHAT YOUR PARENTS ARE DOING OR WHAT YOU'RE PURE GROUP IS DOING THEY IMPOSE THEIR OWN STRUCTURES ON YOU AND SO WHAT THAT CAN DO IS IT CAN REALLY LIMIT YOUR MIND SET IN TERMS OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE IN WHAT IT IS TAT YOU'R CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING AND SO OFTEN TIMES WHEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IDENTITY FOR CLOSURE THEY HAVE TO TAKE A LOT OF ACTIVE STEPS TO OVERCOME WHATEVER BIACIES OR LIMITATIONS THEY EXPERIENCED AS A YOUNG PERSON U'M GIVEN WHAT THEY WERE PROJECTED TO DO OR BELIEVE RIGHT I'M SO IDENTITY YOU KNOW CAN BE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO CAN ALSO BE ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN THE WORLD RIGHT AND SO A LOT OF THOSE BELIEFE SYSTEMS ARE ALSO PASSED ON YOU INHERRIT BELIFT SYSTEMS FROM THE PEOPLE UM THAT SURROUND YOU WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED IT'S THAT WE WE TEND TO PUT A HUGE CREMIUM ON WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO WE TENDED TO FINE OURSELVES BY WHAT WE DO AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IN THE QUESTIONS WE ASKE YOUNG CHILDREN WHAT DO YOU WANT O VIE WHEN YOU GROW UP RIGHT WE NEVER SAY WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP WHAT CIND A PERSON DO WANT TO BE WHN YOU GROW UP WE SAY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT KIND OF MIND SET IS THAT WE END OF ANCHORING OUR IDENTITIES VERY FIRMLY TO WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO AND I CERTAINLY YOU NR TAK YOU WERE ALLUDING TO MY PERSONAL STORY RIGHT I STARTED PLAYING THE VIOLIN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID SIX YEARS OLD BECAME ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED AND FOR THE LARGE PART OF MY CHILDHOOD I WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST A VIOLINIST I MEAN IF IAD MET YOU IF F YOU LIKE HEY ANDREW I'M A VIOLINIST AND THEN THE SECOND UP WOULD BE I'M MY THAT'S HOW TETHERED MY IDENTITY WAS TO TO BEING A VIOLINIST AND THEN FAST FORWARD TO WHAT I'M ATENATUR OUN OVE THESE HUGE DREAMS OF OF GOING PRO AND AND BECOMING OU NO YET JUST LIKE A HOPEFULLY A PROFESSIONAL VIOLINIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND THEN I TEAR ATTENDED IN MY HAND MY DREAMS AND OVERNIGHT AND SUDDENLY THERE'S THIS PROFOUND LOSS OF IDENTITY BECAUSE WHAT I HADN'T REALIZED IS THAT IN LOSING THE VIOLIN SURE I WAS LOSING THE ABILITY TO PLAY THE INSTRUMENT BUT I WAS ACTUALLY LOSING A HUGE CART OF WHO I WAS AND THAT WAS SO DESTABLIZING AND SO DISORIENTING FOR ME BECAUSE WHEN YOU DEFINE YOURSELF BY THE WHAT THEN AS SOON AS THE WHAT GOES AWAY YOU'RE LIKE OH MA GOSH WHO THEL AM I RIGHT WHAT DO I DO WHUT WHAT VALUE DO I BRING TO THE WORLD AND WHAT I EXPERIENCED AT THE TIME IS KNOWN IN A COGNIT OF SCIENCE AS IDENTITY PARALYSIS AH MAYBE YOU FELT THIS WAY DURING VARIOUS TRANSITIONS IN YOUR LIFE BUT BASICALLY WHO YOU ARE IN WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT IS SUDDENLY CALLED INTO QUESTION AND YOU END OT FEELING REALLY STUCK RIGHT YOU YOU DON'T SEE YOU DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO IMAGIN WHAT A FUTURE COULD LOOK LIKE AND I CERTAINLY FELL PRAY TO IDENTITY PARALYSIS AND IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO CONNIVE FIGURE OUT WHAT MY PATH WOULD LOOK LIKE MOVING FORWARD BUT I LEARNE TO REALLY VALUABLE LESSON FROM THAT VERY FORMITIVE EXPERIENCE I HAVE THE CHANGE ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT I SHOULD DEFIND MYSELF AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH I I DON'T THINK OUR DESIRE IS HUMANS TO HAVE IDENTITIES IS GOING ANYWHERE WE'RE NOTC YOUALL TO DISPOSE OF IDENTITIES AND WE SHOULDN'T BECAUSE OUR SELF IDENTITIES BRING US SO MUCH MEANING AND PURPOSE IN OUR LIVES RIGHT YOU'RE A PODCASTER I'M A PODCASTER YOU'RE A SCIENTISTS I'M A SCIENTIST THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY REALLY HELPFUL AND MOTIVATING SO WE DON'T WANT TO DO AWAY WITH IDENTITIES ALTOGETHER BUT WHAT WE CAN BE MORE PARTICULAR ABOUT IS WHAT WE ANCHOR ARE IDENTITIES TOO AND I HAVE LEARNED IN MY ADULT LIFE TO ANCHOR MY IDENTITY TO WHY I DO THE THINGS I DO RATHER THAN WHAT I DO AND I FOUND THIS TO BE A MUCH MORE DURABLE RELIABLE RELATIONSHIP SO TO MAKE THIS CONCRETE LESSING ABY THE VIOLIN WRIT A SURE I LOVED PLAYING I LOVED HOW MUSIC SOUNDED AI LOVE THE WAY THE VIOLIN FELT AM BUT WHEN I STRIPPED AWAY ALL THE SUPERFICIAL FEATURES OF THE VIOLIN WHAT I REALLY REALLY LOVED AND WAS SO DRAWN TO AS A YOUNG CHILD AM WAS THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION THAT I COULD FORM THROUGH MY MUSIC SO THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH MY ORCHESTRA MATES MY CHAMBER MUSICIAN FRIENS A PLAYING A SOLO AND AND PERFORMING IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE AND IN IDEALLY WE ALL FEEL SOMETHING NEW THAT WE HAVEN'T FELT BEFORE I'M USE KIND OF AND INTOXICATING FEELING WHEN YOURE LITTLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INSPIRE NEW FEELINGS IN PEOPLE RIGHT AND I WAS SO DRAWN TO HUMAN CONNECTION AND WHEN I REALIZED THAT HUMAN CONNECTION WAS AT THE HEART OF WHAT IT IS THAT DRIVES ME AS A PERSON RIGHT LIKE WHAT LIGHTS ME IVE EVERY SINGLE DAY IS A DESIRE TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PSYCHOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR MIND'S WORK THEN WHEN THE VIOLIN WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME EVEN INTRBS THE NARRATIVE I TELL MYSELF ABOUT MY LIFE I COULD STILL FIND THAT SAME CORE UNDERLYING FEATURE ELSEWHERE AND I HAD BEEN AVIL TO RGHT I FOUND IT A AS AN ECADEMIC AS A COGNENT OF SCIENTIST WHO STUDIES THE SCIENCE OF CONNECTION AND IN EMOTION A I SEEN IT I SEE NE CONNECTION PLAY OUT IN THE IN THE WORK THAT I DID IN PUBLIC POLICY WHEN I WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE OBVIOUSLY WITH MY PODCAST A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS YOU'RE FORMING THESE INTIMATE CONNECTIONS OF PEOPLE EVERY DAY AND SO EVEN THOUGH IT FEELS IN MY LIFE LIKE I'VE DONE SUCH DISPERATE THINGS RIGHT THERE ACTUALLY IS A POWERFUL THROUGH LINE A THAT CONNECTS ALL OF THEM AND THAT IS MY DESIRE TO CONNECT EMOTIONALLY AND SO WHAT I WOULD RECONNHEN TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING ESESPECIALLY IF IN THEREIN THE THROWS OF CHANGE IN THEIR FEELING TE STABLIZED BY THAT THREAT TO IDENTITY THAT LOSS OF IDENTITY IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THERE THROUGH INETS IT LIKE WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING FEATURES OF THE THINGS THAT YOU USED TO DO THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY LOKE AND CAN YOU FIND THE EXPRESSION IN THAT ELSEWHERE I LOVE THAT AND I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS A THE FIRST ONE RELATES BACK TO CHILDHOOD IDENTITIES AND HOW WE OFTEN CAN PROJECT ON TO CHILDREN WHAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO BECOME A I SEE THAT IS MOSTLY BENEVOLENT YOU KNOW YOU A YOU OBSERVE A CHILD PLAYING WITH TRUCKS IN THE SAND BOX AND AND WE SAY  OH YOU KNOW THERE CAN BECOME A CONTRACTOR AM WE TEND TO PROJECT A ROLLS THAT ARE FAIRLY HIGH OUP THE WITHIN OCCUPATION HIERCHY I AN WE WAS FOR LIKE ANY PARENTS YOU KNOW YO YOU WISH FOR THE THE BEST POSSIBLE LIFE FOR YOUR KITS AM BUT I CONSEE THAT THE PERILS OF DOING THAT UM IF THEN IT STARTS TO THINK WILE THAT'S WHAT I'M BOUND TO BECOME BECAUSE I IT IS RESTRICTIVE I ALSO IMFASCINATED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN WE ARE ADOLESCENSE AND TEENS THERE'S A TENDENCY TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT IDENTITY LIKE WHO AM I I DON'T KNOW MANY FORTY YEAR OLD THAT'S  WHO AM I AT UNA AT ONE'S CORE ONE'S ESSENCE AND WE MIGHT CHANGE CAREERS CHANGE RELATIONSHIPS CHANGE GEOGRAPHIES YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE BRAIN IN THOSE ADOLESCENT AND TEEN YEARS THAT FORCES THIS QUESTION OF SELF OF O KNOW WHO AM I AND TEAN AGORS ANE NOTORIOUS FOR TRYING ON DIFFERENT UNIFORMS DIFFERENT FRIEND GROUPS DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS AS A WAY TO SORT THAT OUT SOMETIMES IN WAYS THAT SUPPORT THEM INAN SOMETIMES AWAYS THAT ACT AS PITFALLS M SOME CURIOUS ABOUT A WHAT'S KNOWN ABOUT HOW WE DEVELOP OUR OWN IDENTITY  FROM THE INSIDE OUT AS WELL AS FROM THE OUTSIDE AND YADOW IT'S I THAT THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING INSULSES A MAN VERY CURIOUS ABOUT AND MAN WE KNOW FROM NARASIENCE RESEARCH THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT THE BRAIN UNDERGOES DURING PUBERTY AND THER PERIODS OF ADOLESCENCE AND AND THE PRIMARY CHANGE THAT WE SEE IS A DESIRE FOR INDEPENDENCE AND SO ONE REASON WHY WE SEE TEA NATURES GRAFFLING WITH THIS QUESTION OF WHO I AM IS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BREAKING FROM THESE STRUCTURES THAT THEY GREW UP AROUND RIGHT THE IMPOSED STRUCTURES RIGHT THE IDENTITY FORECLOSURE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCE AND OUR STARTING TO FIGURE OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ARE WANTING TO ASK THE QUESTION FOR THE FIRST TIME WHO DO I WANT TO BE WHAT DO I WANT TO DO OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEMS THAT I'VE GROWN NOTHIN AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY WE FIND THAT DURING TEAN AH YEARS A THIS THIS SORT OF QUESTION IS ASKED MORE COMMONLY A I THINK THAT ONE CHALLENGE THAT A WE CAN BECAN FACE CAUS YOU YOUYOU SAID THIS ONE WORD THAT REALLY CALLE MY ATTENTION WHICH WAS WHAT'S MY ESSENCE AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I STUDIED AS A CALGNUOF SCIENTIST IS THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WHAT'S CALLED ESSENTIALISM SO OUR UNDERLYING BELIEF THAT THERE ARE ESSENTIAL QUALITIES TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IMMUTABLE N THERE'S LOTS OF STUDIES WITH YOU KNOW YOUNG CHILDREN DULLS SHOWING THAT WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE DO HAVE THESE ESSENCES RIGHT AND U'M CLEAR WHAT THAT EVEN MEANS FROM ININ METAPHYSICAL SENSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD EVEN MEAN A BUT I THINK THE THE CHALLENGE IN BELIEVING THAT WE HAVE ESSENCES IS THAT IT LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THESE TRULY IMMUTABLE STATES ABOUT OURSELVES THAT ARE THAT WE'RE INCAPABLE OF CHANGING AND I THINK THIS CAN GIVE RISE TO FEELINGS OF SHAME FOR EXAMPLES SO WHAT IS SHAME SHAME IS NOT THE FEELING OH I DID SOMETHING THAD SHAME IS THE FEELING I AM THAD RIGHT IT'S NOT THAT I LOST AT SOMETHING I FAILED AT SOMETHING IT'S THAT I'M A LOSER I'M A FAILURE AND SO THE PROBLEM WHEN WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE ESSENCE PEACE IS THAT IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE KIND OF MALUABLE WAY OF THINKING THAT ACTUALLY THERE MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING THATS SO DEFINING ABOUT YOU THAT YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF CHANGING AS HUMANS MAYBE ALL WE ARE COLLE CTIONS A BEHAVIORS AND THOUGHTS RIGHT AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO IT THAN THAT AND I FIND THAT WAY OF THINKING OF IT MORE FREEING WHEN IT COMES TO WHO WE ARE BECAUSE I THINK IT ALLOWS FOR I THINK IT A LOWS US TO CULTIVATE MORE OVER GROWTH MINDS SAT I THINK IT PREVENTS US FROM ENGAGING IN THESE VERY HARMFUL SELF NARRATIVES THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE ABOUT THEMSELVES I MEAN PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ISN'T IN HERE PODCAS OUR SELF CRITICAL I'VE A VERY SELF CRITICAL PERSON WER WE LISTEN TO THIS BEGS A GONE TO IMPROVE EN ON THE STAND OF YOUR SHOC AS I WANT TO BE BETTER AND I WANT TO IMPROVE THAT THAT ALSO IS OFTEN ACCOMPANIE VY A LOT OF SELF BRATING AND QUESTIONING HIMSELF RIGHT AND SO AM YE I THINK I'VE JUST TRIED TO HAVE A SLIGHTLY MORE CAPICIOUS UNDERSTANDING OF A WHO I AM AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THERE MIGHT NOT REALLY BE THESE ESSENTIAL FEATURES THAT ARE THT ARE ANEEDAFLE I DONT IF YOU RESINATE WITH THIS NOTION LIKE THE ESSENT LIKE THE DESIRE TO FEEL THAT WE HAVE ESSENCES YE I I USE THE WORD ESSENCE WITHOUT THINKING I'M TOO CAREFULLY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT BUT W I WHAT I A WHAT I TRYING TO SAY WHEN I SAID ESSENCE UM IS YOU KNOW AS A CHILD A I DID CERTAIN THINGS AND ENJOYED SOME OF THEM DIDN'T ENJOY OTHERS AND I REALLY DISLIKED OTHERS UM A A VERY FAMOUS NORL SCIENTIST WHOS AT CALTAC MAY MARCAS MISTER PEOPLE LITERALLY REFER TO M AS THE GREAT MARCUS MISTER ONCE SAID AND ICE TOLLY SUBSCRIBE TO THE FACT THAT NORL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN I BASICALLY DIVIDE OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCE ALONG THE DIMENSIONS OF YUM YUCH AND ME THERE'S NOT A LOT OF IN BETWEEN YERI BECAUSE THE CIRCUITS ALTIMATELY HAVE TO DRIVE EITHER FORWARD MOVEMENT TOWARD MORE YEI UM APPETITIVE BEHAVIOURS AS INNERD SPEAK OR AVERSIVE  A LEANING OUT I DON'T WANT THAT OR JUST KIND OF A A A NEUTRAL RESPONSE A YOMYA CAN ME YA SEEMS TO BE THE UM THE TRINARY A RESPONSE AND THERE IS THIS COMPONENT OF CHILDHOOD I THINK WHERE WE ARE FORGING NATURALLY USING OUR SENSES DO EXPERIENCING YUMG YACH SAND MEZ AND HEARING YUNG YUCHS AND MEZ FROM OUR PARENTS THAT'S GOOD THAT'S BAD THAT'S WHATEVERNCE NEUTRAL BUT AT SOME POINT I CERTAINLY AVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE AND IAVE OBSERVED OTHERS I THINK HAVING THE EXPERIENCE OF FEELING SOMETHING THAT'S ON A DIFFERENT DIMENSION ENTIRELY WHICH IS THE NOTION OF DELIGHT WHICH IS THAT IT IT FORFILS YOUR BODY WITH A SENSE OF SO MUCH YUM THAT IT GIVES YOU ENERGY TO DO SO MUCH MORE OF IT IN A WAY THAT THAT IS AM ALMOST ON A DIFFERENT PLAN AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE IN O SPIRITUAL OR METAPHYSICAL ABOUT IT BUT IT FEELS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT REPRESENTS BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT AM THAT PIECE THAT PERHAPS EVEN AS A SCIENTIS I DON'T RELIEV MEAN TO ASSIGN A NERL CIRCUIT TO UM SO DO YOU THINK WHAT YOUR DESCRIBING IN PART IS THE FEELING OF AWE LIKE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DELIGHT DO YOU THINK PART OF IT IS IS A FEELING OF AWE HEL LIKE THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO NEW YORK CITY IS A SIX YEAR OLD KID I REMEMBER THINKING IN I STILL FEEL EVERY TIME I I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PLACE SUCCESS IT'S LIKE A IT'S LIKE A HUMAN TROPICAL REEF LIKE EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK THEIRE'S LIFE SO THAT WAS THAT WAS AWE AND DELIGHT ALTHOUGH I SAW SOMETHINGS THIS WAS NEW YORK IN THE SEVENTIES AND THERE AS SANDINGS LIKE TIME SQUARE IN THE SAVNITY TER IT IF ANYONE SEEM THAT SHOW THE DEUCES I MENCE LIKE IT LOOKD LIKE THAT IT WAS ESPECIALY AS A YOUNG KID WOS CAN AVERSIVE YA UM SO WASN'T ALWAYS ADED AT BUT THE DELIGHT OF FOR ME WAS IN LEARNING UN CERTAIN ANIMALS IN CERTAIN THINGS FOR YOU AS THE VIOLIN AND AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I AND AWE BY THE WAY I MEAN IT CAN BE AVERSE THE VRIGHT SO ADED MEN IT NECESSARILY I THINK IN THE WESTERN WORLD WE THINK OF ONSFYING EXPERIENCEAS AS FAVING A POSITIVE EMOTIONAL VEILANCE BUT THEY CAN ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL VAILENCE SO ON THE TWO CRITERIA FOR A SATISFYING IN AW INSPIRING EXPERIENCE AN IN HA LOT OF THIS WORK COMES FROM DOCR CALTNER ARNOARICALLY YA IS AN ONE THERE SHOULD BE SOME ELEMENT OF PERCEIVED VASTNESS AH THIS IS ALL ROUGH THIS IS ALL REFERENCE DEPENDENCE AS ALL TASE ON YOUR OWN FRAME OF MIND I ON THAT THERE IS THIS SENSIVE LIKE MISTERY AND WONDER AT JUST HOW VAST EITHER THE PHYSICAL APPARATUSES WRIGHT LIKE TIME SQUARECIS MASSIVE OU NO SET OF BUILDINGS AND IT KIND OF OVERWHELMS YOUR SENSES BECAUSE OF ALL THE LIFES AND SOUNDS THAT ARE HITTING A YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IN YOUR AUDITORY SYSTEM U THERE'S ALSO CONSEPTUAL VASTNESS SO WE CAN FEEL AL WHEN WE UM FEEL THE DELIGHT OF A NEW SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY RIGHT OR IN MY CASE LIKE FOR THE FIRST TIME READING A BOOK ABOUT HOW THE MINE WORKS I JUST REMEMBER MARVELING AT THIS ORGAN AND JUST BEING COMPLETELY IN ALE OF HOW IT WORKS UM AND THEN THE SECOND CRITERIA FOR AN AW INSPIRING EXPERIENCE WAT I WHICH I THINK MIGHT HAVE EEN MET AS WELL WHEN YOU WERE IN WHEN WHEN YOU WERE I NEW YORK IS WHAT'S CALLED A NEED FOR ACCOMMODATION SO IT'S JUST A FANCY WAY OF SAYING THAT WE'VE A CERTAIN MENTAL MODEL OF THE WORLD AN TIFICALLY IN THE CRESENCE OF ALL WE NEED TO A SIMILATE THIS NEW INFORMATION WITH OUR EXISTING MODEL CAUS IT CHALLENGES IT IN SOME WAY AND UM IT MAKES US IT ACTUALLY LEADS US TO HAVE MORE OPEN MINDS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WE REALIZE WEET A SECOND M I'VE THIS EXISTING VISION LIKE WHAT THE WORLD IS LIKE AND NOW 'N EXPERIENCING THIS NEW THING AND I NEED A KIND OF MAKE IT WORK AND  INTIGRATE IT WITH MY EXISTING UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD AND THAT'S THE MINE BLOWING PART OF IT RIGHT U BUT I ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I REMEMBER MY CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE KIND OF MERRORING YOUR EXPERIENCE IN NEW YORK WAS I WAS UM I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD AND MEVE ELEVEN YEARS OLD I WAS AT A SUMMER MUSIC CAMP IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT I HAD MY DISMAN WICH IS HOW HE LISTENED TO THINGS BACK IN THE DAY O I HAD A SIDY AN THERE UM IT WAS THE BATOVEN VIOLEN CONCHERITO BY ONSOPHY MUTR AND I WAS I WAS LIKE I WAS SO YOUNG ANDREW SO I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW IT IS THAT I FELT SOMETHING THAT WAS SO POW POWERFUL AND SO TRANSCENDENT BUT I REMEMBER LISTENING TO THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THIS VIOLENG CANCHERITO AND IT CONSUMED ME I MEAN I FELT CHILLS UP AND DOWN MY SPINE MY HEART WOULD RACE ALONG WITH THE MELODY IT FELT OTHER WORLDLY RIHT AND I THINK THAT WAS KIND OFUT YOUARE GETTING UP BEFOR WER ITS LIKE ITS  THIS ALTERED STATE OF MIND AND I WHAT I THE LANGUAGE I USE SINCE TO CODE THAT EXPERIENCEIS THAT IT WAS AN AWINS FIRING EXPERIENCE LETHING BOTH THINGS HAPPENED RIGHT I I WASULSE I WAS IN I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE VASTNESS OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT ALSO S SENT ME THROUGH TIME IN THIS INTERESTING WAY YOU KNOW BACK TO LIK THE TIMETIME OF TAY TOVEN WRITES TO THE VASTNESS CAN EXISTS ALONG A TEMPORAL HORIZON AND THEN THE NEED FOR ACCOMMODATION WHICH WAS YOU NOW I IDN'T STUDIED COGNAT SCIENCE AT THIS POINTS I M EVER THINKING I CANNOT BELIEVE A COLLECTION OF MUSICAL NOTES ARRANGED JUST SO CAN MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY AND THAT IF YOU WERE TO TWIK IT JUST LIGHTLY JUST LIKE TAKE THE E FLAT MOVE IT DOWN THETON THISTREAVD LITTLEOF IT EMOTIONAL RESIDENCE COMPLETELY GONE FROM THE PASSAGE AND THERE WIS JUST SOMETHING SO SIMPLE AND MAGICAL ABOUT THAT REALIZATION SO AND MI RESINATE WITH WITH THIS KIND OF DELIGHT AN AWE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU DESCRIBED YE I'M SO GLAD YOU YOU DESCRIBE IT THAT WAY YOU KNON O THISISN'T A DISCUSSION ABOUT MY EXPERENCE BUT FOR ME I REALIZE NOW THAT NEW YORK WAS AWE INSPIRING I'M PRIOR TO THAT THE ONLY THING SIMILAR WAS DISCOVERING ANIMAL SPECIALIZATION SOMETHING I'M STILL FASTENING BY THE SENSORY SYSTEMS OF ANIMALS AND HOW THEY EXPERIENCED THE WORLD AND HOW HUMAN'S EXPERIENCED THE WORLD AND THEN ULTIMATELY IT WAS WELL THET I WENT IT SCAPE WORING IN THAT WHOLE LANDSCAPE AND THEN EVENTUALLY INTO E NUR SCIENCE Y THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW YORK EXPERIENCE OF AWE AND I DO THINK THAT'S WHAT IT WAS AND BIOLOGY ANIMALS AND EVENTUALLY NURRO SCIENCE YIS THAT LIKE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH MUSIC AND REALIZING THAT THE MOVEMENT OF A NOTE COULD CHANGE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY WHEN IT CAME TO LEARNING ABOUT BIOLOGY AND NUR SCIENCE I FELT NOT JUST AWE BUT A SENSE OF DELIGHT IN THAT I FELT THERE WAS A PLACE FOR ME THERE YAND WHAT  WI AM OUT OF WHAT YOU JUST AST ATA I REALLY REALLY UM RESINATED IN TERMS OF THIS MOVING OF A NOTE BECAUSE IT TOOK SOMETHING FROM A PASSIVE EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE OF THAT'S THIS INCREDIBLE THING OVER THERE LIKE NEW YORK CITY A BUT I DIDN'T SEE MYSELF HAVING ANY KIND OF UM VERB STATE WITHIN IT THAT WOULD CHANGE IT OR ALTER IT HOW IT IS OR FOR ME WHEREAS WITH MUSIC FOR YOUR I THINK NURROW SCINS WHEN I REALIZE THAT YOU COULD DO EXPERIMENTS YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO SOME SORT OF MANIPULATION AND THROUGH THAT HOPEFULLY UNVEIL SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN WORKS I THOUGHT THERE'S A PLACE FOR ME HERE AND SO I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE A THE EXPERIENCE OF SOMETHING JUST JUS FROM A RAW SENSORY PERSPECTIVE MUSIC OR ANIMALS OR NURRO SCINS IN THE EXAMPLES WERE USING HERE UTHEN REALIZING THAT THERE'S A VERB STATE OF SELF LIKE THAT I COULD ENACT SOMETHING WITHIN IT THAT COULD GIVE ME MORE OF THAT WHEREAS I THINK WHEN AS YOUNG KID NEW YORK CITY I I JUST IDNT FEEL ANYWHAY THAT I COULD PLUG INTO IT EXCEPT IN A PASSIVE WAY AUS IT'S THE DIFERENCE BETWEEN A KID WHO THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MADE WHO SEES A GAME OF SOCKER FOOTBALL OR BASEBALL OR WATCHES THE OLYNTIC IN GOS THAT IS AMAZING AND THE KID THAT SAYS I MONT AGO DO THAT IN FACT I COULD DO THAT AND I COULD MAY THE DO THAT EVEN BETTER OR EVEN HALF AS WELL AND SO UM THE DELIGHTS I THINK IS IN THE POSSIBILITY OF OF ENGAGEMENT OF I AND AND UMFASCINATED YOU KNOW FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A TROMATHERAPIS HE ISN'T HE'S NOT A NURROW SCIN TO SEE AL IY SAYS H YOUR NOUNS ARE JUST VERY SLOW VERBS BUT VERBS ARE FAR MORE EXCITING BECAUSE THEY CREATE THIS ANTICIPATORY ACTIVITY ANYWAY UM I OT I LOVED BEFORE YOU MOVE ON FROM THAT I LOVE THE YOU SAID OT IT AIS YOUR HELPING ME REALIZE SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT IT HOW I SAW MY ROLE AS THE VIOLENTESK AND IN IDIT YOU NOW I NEVER GET A MODIFY THE NOTES ON THE PAGE BECAUSE I AS LAN GANATHE FAITHFUL TO WHIT FATOVAN WROTE THIS IS WHAT MADE YOU A GREAT MAGICIAN IN ME A IT BY THE WAY I WAS A FAILED VIOLIN THEN'T HOLD ME OUT OF IT BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORS DOGS HOWL  I WAS IN SZUKI I WAS  WAS SO TERRIBLE AT IT THAT THEY LEARLY MADE ME STOP LING MUS JUST JUST TO PROTECT THE NAMER THAT'S A DORABLE AND WEU WILL TALK ABOUT THE SIENCE AN QUITTIC MAY BE LATER WHEN I WATHER GREAT HOICE FOR YOU UM I I BUT WHAT I'M REALIZING IS THAT THERE WAS THAT ELEMENT OF DEFINING SELF THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF THE INSTRUMENT AND UM I SAW A PLACE FOR MYSELF EXACTLY LIKE YOU DID WHERE I THOUGHT I DECIDE HOW THIS PHRASE UNFOLDS I DECIDE HOW MUCH FERBRADO I USE I DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT THE ANGLING OF MY BOU IS AND THE CADENCE IN THE PASING AND THE EMOTION THAT I BRING TO THE EXPERIENCE AND WHEN YOU SEE IT PLACE FOR YOURSELF AND THAT TAKES AN ALL INSPIRING EXPERIENCE AND THEN TRANT AND ACTUALLY THERE'S A TRANSLATION PROCESS WHERE YOU BECOME SOMETHING BIGGER THAN WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD BE NASHES SO INTERESTING YOU MENTIONE THIS ENTERY BECAUSE I I' BEEN CHATTING RECENTLY WITH THE GUY NAMED REGINALD DWAIN BETS AND HE SPENT NINE YEARS IN PRISON AH AND HE'S NOW A INTERNATUONALLY RENOUNED SCHOLAR SO AH HE COMMITTED A CARJACKING WHEN HE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD UM AND THAN WENT TO IN ADULT PRISON FOR NINE YEARS AND AS A FIFTEEN RESI AS HE JUST TURNED SIXTEEN BY THE TIME HE GOT HIS SENTENCE YE I WAS TORTALLY WILD AND UM HE HE ACTUALLY TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THERE WAS HIS UNDERGROUND LIBRARY IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE COULD BE IN THE PRISON WHAT IDENTITY HE COULD TAKE ON UM WHEN EVERY ONE SEEMED TO BE DEFINED BY WHAT CRIME THEY HAD COMMITTED RIGHT TFELT LIKE HIS IMAGINATION WAS SO LIMITED TO TO IT IN TALK ABOUT IDENTITY PRALSIS RIGHTE AND MEAN LIKE YOU'RE DENIED ALL YOUR BASIC FREEDOMS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WRITES YOU REALLY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMAGINE WHAT MORE HE COULD BE SO ONE DAY HE GETS A BOOK I CALLED THE BLACK POETS AND IN IN THE BOOK HE READ A POEM BY ETRIGE NIGHT WHOAD ALSO SPENT TIME IN PRISON AD WRITTEN THIS INCRE TABLY STIRRING POEM ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I HE GOES BY DWAN BUT WHET DWAN SHARED WITH ME IS HE SAID I WAS IN I WAS AWE INSPIRED BY WHAT I WAS READING BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT HAPPENED IN READING THAT BOOK AND UNDERSTANDING THE AUTHOR'S HISTORY IS THAT IT GAVE ME SOMETHING TO BE I SAW A PLACE FOR MYSELF IN THIS WORLD AND HE BE HE WROTE I MEAN HE WAS SO PROLIFIC HE BROTE LIKE A THOUSAND POEMS IN THE YEAR AFTER HE STUMBLED UPON THIS BOOK AND HE ENDED UP WINNING TH MIC ARTHUR GENIUS A WORD HE WENT TO YE LOSCHALA MUSHES JUST CRUSHED IT EVER SINCE IM I THINK HE SOMEWHAT UPON A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS AH THERE'S AN FASCINATING SCIENCE OF AWE AND ALL THE BENEFITS IT CAN CONFERRED TO OUR WELL BEING BUT IT CAN ALSO SERVE AS AN ENTRY POINT TO HELPING TO DEFINE OUR IDENTITIES IN NEW PLACES AND I JUST LOVE THAT I THINK THATS IT IS A WONDERFUL WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW WOULDN'T WE SEE OURSELVES IM ENTERING THE SCEER OF EXPERIENCE THAT IM THIS CONIS EVOKING AH I DI THINK IT SOMETHING ABOUT IT CONVERTS TO THIS DELIGHT TELL THOUG I'VE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LANGUAGE IS INSUFFICIENT TO DESCRIBE A LOT OF WHAT WERE REFERRING TO WRIT YAS IT THE YOU KNOW I' THE EVEN THE MOST REDUCTIONOUS LANGUAGE OF VIOLOGY IM CAN'T GRAB THE I'M HIGHER ORDER EMOTIONS AN COMPLEXITY NOT YET ANYWAY WE JUST DON'T HAVE AT I LANGUAGE FOR IT I'M I'D LIKE TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE VIOLIN I NOT JUST CAUSE I'V FAILED MISERABLY AT THE VIOLIN BUT I SHULD I'VE FIGURED OUT FOR THE EARLY ON I WASN'T GOING TO BE A MUSICIAN II STILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOABILITY TO READ MUSIC I CAN MEMORIZE LYRICS VER EASILY BUT AND I LOVE MUSIC A MOUN OF CLASSICAL MUSIC IM AS WELL AS OTHER FORMS OF MUSIC BUT ZERO MUSICAL TOLN YOU ON THE OTHER HAND IM GOT QUITE GOOD AT VIOLIN IM IT WAS INTERESTING FOR ME TO LEARN THAT THE VIOLIN WAS A BIT OF A REBELLIOUS CHOICE FOR YOUE GIVEN YOUR YOUR FAMILY HISTORY AND YOU AN I DO BOT SHARE THIS TIME FAIRLY UNUSUAL A FACT THAT BOTH OF OUR FATHERS AR THEORETICAL PHYSICIS SO DID YOU FEEL PRESSURE TO BE A SCIENTIST OR SOMETHING ELSE IN BEING A MUSICIAN AM WAS THAT INITIALLY LOOKED AT AS YOU KNO ROUT TO POVERTY OR EROR A BAD CHOICE OR WERE YOUR PARENTS A BIT MORE CAUTIOUS LIKE OH OH CA THAT THAT'S CRAPA MAY ME MAKE THAT A SUPPLEMENT TO YOUR OTHER STUDIES AND PURSUITS YES O I'M THE YOUNGEST OF FOUR KIDS AND CANISTERIA TYPICALLY MY THREE OLDER SIBLINGS FOR TOTAL MATHWISIS THEY WER TAKING THE ESSAY TOOU WIN THEY WERE HER WHEN THEY WERE VERY YOUNG THEY WERE SO TALENTED N BUT I THINK ONE ANTAGONIST TO SOME OF THOSE CULTURAL FORCES AS THAT MY MAM WHEN SHE HAD GROWN UP IN INDIA HAV FELT VERY STIFLED BY HER ENVIRONMENT LIKE AS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS VERY CAPABLE AND VERY SMART AND SHE MAD JURED IN PHYSICS OM SHE WAS MOSTLY YOU KNOW KEPT TO THE SPACES OF DOMESTIC TORES OCCASIONAL SINGING LESSONS OM BUT MOSTLY HER JOB WAS LIKE DEAR HOMEWORK AND THEN HELP WITH COOKING RIT IN CLEANING AND WHAT NOT AND SO WHEN SHE MOVED TO THIS COUNTRY WITH MY DAD IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AM SHE WAS ACTULLY VERY EXCITED SHE WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD BY THE WAYS O ONCE VORY SHORT SHE'D MET MY DAD TWENTY DAYS FRIAR DID THEYR GETTING MARRIED SO AS AN ARRANGE MEETING AND ON MY DAD IS A DOING A HIS POSTOCK AT HARVARED IN PHYSICS AT THE SOCIETY OF FELLOWS AND MY MOM DISJOINS HIM AFTER A WINTER BREAK AH IN THE DOOR OF AN EVERANS LIKE CAME AN HOW WAS YOUR BREAK AND THIS Y I WENT SNOWBORDING AND I WENT WHATEVER TTTAHO AND MY DAS LI I GOT MARRIED AND SO O THIS NEW COUPLE ARRIVES AND MY MM WAS SO LONELY IN THIS COUNTRY AN MEAN THIS WAS BEFORE YOU COULD TEXT OR PARENTS OVER SEAS OR USA WHAT'S AT GROUP SOC SHE COULD ONLY HANDWRITE LETTERS TO HER FAMILY BACK HOME AND HERD HER GOAL WAS YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO CRADE A LITTLE ARMY AROUND ME IN THE FORM OF CHILDREN SO SHE HAD FOUR KIDS AND SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY INTENS ON A SPOSING US TO AS MANY EXTRA CIRCULAR ACTIVITIES AS SHE COULD SO I TOO OLDER BROTHERS AND I'VE AN OLDER SISTER ESPECIALLY HER GIRLS SHE SAID YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AM YOUD  LIT LAY THE LAND WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG BUT WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING THAT YOUR PASSIONATE ABOUT I REALLY WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLOR IT SO I THINK I REALLY BENEFITED FROM THE FACT THAT SHE HAD BEEN DENIED THAT KIND OF EXPOSURE AND THE ABILITY TO PURSUE WHOR HER DREAMS ARTISTIC OR OTHERWISE AND SO SHE WAS REALY HELL TAN ON MAKING SURE AH THAT WEK KIDS WERE ABL TO I THINK THEY WERE I MEAN Y OLDER THREE CIBLINGS PLAYED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SO LIKE CLARENET TRUMPET FLUTE I THINK THEY WERE SURPRISED BY MY AFFINITY FOR IT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS SIX MY MAM BROUGHT DOWN MY GRANDMOTHER'S VIOLIN FROM THE ATTICS AND MY GRANDMOTHER HAD PLAYED INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC THAT'S WORK SHE WERE YOR SITTING CROSS LIKE IT ON THE FLOOR IN YOUR VIOLINDS FACING THE GROUND IT'S A VERY VEDIFFERENT STYLE OF MUSIC AM THAT AS LIKE A PARTING GIFT MY GRANDMOTHER GIVEN IT TO MY MAM AND SAID HE BRING THIS WITH YOU TO THE US SO SHE OPEN THE INSTRUMENT THAT DAY AND I JUST INSTANTLY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AND AM I ASKED VERY QUICKLY FOR A QUARTERS SIZE VIOLIN OF MY OWN AND WHILE MY PARENTS HAD TO NUDCH ME TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY REALLY NEVER HAD TO PUSH ME TO PRACTICE WHICH FELT EXTRAORDINARY THE TIME LIKE O AT CLEARLY THE VIOLIN IS SOMETHING THAT MYA HAS INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR BECAUSE HOW IS IT THAT WERE NOT ASKING HER YOU HAFTER PRACTICE ALL THE TIME A SIMILAR TO YOU ACTUALLY ANDREW I NEVER TO THIS DAY I'VE A REALLY HARD TIME READING MUSIC SO I NEVER I WAS A TERRIBLE SIGHT READER I I COULDN'T IF YOU PUT A PIECE OF MUSIC IN FRONT OF ME I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TELL YOU PROBABLY WHAT IT WOULD SOUND LIKE TO DAY I LEARNED ENTIRELY BY EAR SO I STARTED WITH THE SUZUKI METHOD WHICH AS YOU KNOW AS ENTIRELY BY EAR AND THAN AM I HAD IN EXTREMELY VERY KIND ALSO BUT VERY INEXPERIENCED TEACHER I WAS HIS FIRST STUDENT AH MY MAMM WENT BACK STAGE AT A SYNPHONY CONCERT IN YOU HAVEN WHICH IS WHERE I GREW UP AND JUST ASKED THE CONCERT MASTER LIKE HAY WILL YOU TEACH MY DAUGHTER AND HE'S LIKE SURE NEVER TAUGHT ANY ONE BEFOR R IF I I'LL GIVE THE TO GO AND SO WE JUST MADE THINGS UP ALONG THE WAY I MEAN HE WOULD PLAY STUFF AND I WOULD MINTI GET AND I WOULD LET MY EMOTIONS AND MY YOU KNOW WHATEVOR INNATE MUSICALITY GUIDE ME AND I EVENTUALLY I MAY THINK WHAT THAT DID ACTUALYS FOR LHY INTERESTING FROM A SKILL BUILDING PERSPECTIVE MY TECHNIQUE ABSOLUTELY SUFFERED IN THE LONG TERM FROM NOT HAVING A MORE STRUCTURE AT APPROACH BUT I WAS ABLE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS ENDEAVOR MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN OTHER KIDS WHO HAD DRILL SERGEANTS THAT WERE FORCING THAT TO LIKE PRACTISE THEIR SCALES EVERY DAY AND PRACTISE A TUS AND NOT STUFF IS SO BORRING RIGHT NDWHEN YOURE LITTLE KIDUS ON A BANG YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE WALL WHEN YOU'RE PUT IT AGAINST THAT WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH SO MANY BARRIERS TO ACT THE ENJOYING THE FUN PARTS TO DIRACT YOU PLAYING THE PIECES SO THE ONE KIND OF FUN AF SIDE ABOUT MY MUSICAL JERTY AS I GOT TO JUMP STRAIGHT TO THE FUN STUFF AND I THINK THAT HELP ME CULTIVATE A MUCH MORE NATURAL LOVE F THE INSTRUMENT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING  G ONE DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSOR IN THE PODCAST  G ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT'S DESIGNED TO ME ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATION OL NUTRITION NEEDS OF COURSE I TRY TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THROUGH WHOLE FOOD SOURCES THAT INCLUDE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS EVERY DAY BUT OFTEN TIMES I SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH SERVINGS BUT WITH A G ONE I'M SURE TO GET ENOUGH VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED AND IT ALSO CONTAINS A DAPTIGENCE TO HELP BUFFER STRESS SIMPLY PUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I TAKE A G ONE I HAVE MORE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND I SLEEP BETTER AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO TASTE GRIGHT FOR ALL THESE REASONS WHENEVER I'M ASKED IF YOU COULD TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT WOULD IT BE I ANSWER AG ONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY AG ONE GO TO DRINK G ONE DOCKCALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER FROM NOW UNTIL AUGUST TWELVE TWENTY TWENTY THREE A G ONE IS GIVING AWAY TEN FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUTS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO AGAIN IF YOU GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOCCALM SLASH HUBERMEN YOU CAN CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF TEN FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO THE INTRINSIC MOTIVATION PART IS SO KEY I'VE TALKED A FEW TIMES BEFORE ON THE PODCAST ABOUT THIS I THINK NOW FAMOUS STUDY THAT WAS DONE AT ON BEING NURSERY SCULL AT STAMFORD WHERE THEY OBSERVED WHAT KITS DID DURING FREE TIME AND THEN THEY REWARDED THEM OR DIDN'T REWARD THEM AND THEN THEY LATER REMOVE THE REWARDS AND THE ESSENTIAL TAKE AWAY IS THAT A RECEIVING REWARDS FOR SOMETHING THAT A CHILD WAS INITIALLY INTRINSICALLY MOTIV AID TO DO UNDER MINE SOME OF THAT INTRINSIC MOTIVATION SO I HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER NOT UM THE FACT THAT YOUR PARENTS NEITHER ENCOURAGE NOR DISCOURAGE YOUR VIOLIN PLAYING MIGHT HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO FULLY EXPRESS IN AND LEAN INTO YOUR INTRINSIC OMOTIVATION I SUPPOSE TO A FOR INSTANCE IN MY CASE UM THERE IS A WE ARE DISTANTLY RELATED NOT CLOSERLY BUT THERE IS A GREAT VIOLINIST BY THE NAME OF BRONASLAW HUBERMAN WHO HAS A STREET NAMED AFTER HIM IN ISRAEL IF THERE'S A FAMOUS OR OMAND INSTIME PLAYING VIOLIN TOGETHER AND I WAS TOLD ABOUT THAT EARLY ON AND WHEN I FAILED TO PLAY WELL AFTER A COUPLE OF PRACTICES I WAS CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS NOWAY IWAS CAN A LIVE UP TO IT AND I QUIT T T HI A HI AITS HI AANES THAT RAL MOVELS THAT I ANN DELIKE ON AMLY AT TURNS OUT I ANBUT EXACTLY AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE OPPORTUNITY IN UM IN KIDS LEANING IN TO IT AND ADULTS PROBABLY LEANING INTO THE SENSORY EXPERIENCE OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND NOT PUTTING THAT UP AGAINST SOME BENCH MARK AND I WORRY ABOUT THAT TO DAY SO MUCH WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND WITH VIDIO GAMES WERE IN AVIDIO GAME ERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING BEING DONE AT THE VERY HIGHEST LEVEL OFTEN BY A SOME ONE QUITE YOUNG IT WERE EARLY IN THEIR CAREER TO THE POINT WERE CAN BE LOVET OVERWHELMING AND I THINK IN THEN WE START MEASURING OURSELVES AGAINST YOU KNOW METRICS THAT ARE NOT ABOUT HAT THE EXPERIENCE UM THAT SAID UM YOUR PARENTS WHATEVER THEY DID ITWORKED OUT WELL ENOUGH THAT YOU BECAME VERY PROFESSIEN RIGHT YOU SUCCEEDED IN GETTING INTO JULIARD WHICH IS AT LEAST FOR MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE MOST COMPETITIVE U MUSIC PREPARATORY IS THAT HOW YOU REFERD TO IT UM THAT ONE CAN POSSIBLY GO TO UM AND SO AT THAT POINT HAD YOUR IDENTITY MERGED WITH THE BEHAVIOUR AND WERE YOU STILL ENJOYING YOURSELF UP INTO THE POINT WE HAD THIS INJURY THEY WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT YE I WAS STILL ENJOYING MYSELF UM AROUND THE TIME WHEN WHEN I OWDITION FOR JULIARD IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID WHICH WASE EVERYTHING WAS KIND OF BEATING MY EXPECTATIONS AND MY PARENTS EXPECTATIONS OFF UNTI THIS POINT RIGHT WHICH IS THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY AND SO IT ALL JUST FELT LIKE I SING ON THE CAKE WELL AUR KIDS FOUND SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY LOVE U THIS IS GREAT WRIGHT IT HI GED SOMETIMES TAKE YOU YEARS DECATES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU LOVE WHAT YOUR PASSION ABOUT AND I THINK WE GO THROUGH THIS RERNUAL PROCESS OFTEN IN OUR LIVES RIGHT I'VE HAD TO HAVE MOMENTS IN LIFE ORN LIKE WHAT DO I LIKE AGAIN WHAT DO I LOVE AGAIN IT SETS OT ALSO T ONE TIME EXPERIENCE IM BUT THERE WAS THERE WAS KIND OF THERE IS A THRILLING ASPECT TO MY MUSICAL LIFE WHEN I WAS YOUNG WHICH IS AGAIN EVERYTHING KIND OF FELT LIS LIKE BONIS UM SO ONES ONE STORY LOVE SHARING IS ABOUT HOW I EVEN GOT INTO JULIARD IN THE FIRST PLACE UM MY PARENTS YOU KNOW SO MY DAS A THEORETICAL PHYSISI PHYSISIS AS HE MENTION MY MAM HELP'S IMMIGRANTS GET GREEN CARS TO STUDYIN THIS COUNTRY NEITHER OF THEM HAD EXPOSURE TO THE CLASSICAL MUSIC SPHERE WRIGHT SO THER LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF TIGER PARENTS LIKE EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO BE TIGER PARENTS THEY WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO DETI FARENTS IN THIS DOVAIN BECAUSE THEY LACKED THE CONNECTIONS AH AND LIKE THE WHEREWITH ALL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO TO TO GO PRO AND AND TO ACCESS THE BEST TEACHERS ARE WHATEVER SO MY MAM WHOIS A VERY FEARLESS PERSON BY NATURE SHE KNEW THAT AT SOME POINT MY PASSION FOR THE VIOLIN WITH SURPASSING HER ABILITY TO LIKE CONNECT ME WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES AND SO ONE WEEK AN WE WERE IN NEW YORK ONSFIRING NEW YORK AND I HAD MY VIOLIN WITH ME CAUSE I HAD ANOTHER AWDITION AND WE WER JUST WALKING BY JULIARC THE BUILDING AND MY MAM WAS JUST EAGER FOR ME TO SEE IT FROM THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE IT'S JUST REALLY COOL AS A KID RIGHTS LIKE ALL YOUR MUSICAL IDOLS WENT TO THIS PLACE I JUST WANTED TO SEE AND LIKE IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR PEARL LIN TO GO IN AND OUT A MADORY TO GO IN AND OUT AS YOIOMA WRIGHT LIKE IS SO EXCITING AND AS FOR PASSING THE ENTRANCE MY MAM LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS UM HEY WHY DON'T WE JUST GO IN AS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I SHE'S LIKE CHU JUST GO IN MUCH WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN AND I'M LIKE AM SECURITY GUARDS AND LIKE A LOT OF OTHER TERRIBLE THINGS MAHAM RIGHT  THAT I HAD A USEFUL ENTHUSIASM THAT LIKE PROPELLED ME INTO THE BUILDING THAT DAY SHE STRIKES UP A CONVERSATION WITH A FELLOW STUDENT AN HERMAM FINDS OUT THAT SHE'S STUDYING WITH LIKE A TOP TEACHER AT JULIARD I AS A WE CAN GET AN INTRODUCTION WITHIN AN HOUR I MODITIONING FOR THIS TEACHER ON THE SPOT RITE NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS GOD HATEN I UM YA HE TELLS ME A HE HAS WHAT OEVERTUE AS A LIKE MOU DED ENTHUSIASM ABOUT MY PLAYING DOESN'T THIY I'M GREAT BUT SEE SOMETHING LIKE YOU TOLD ME LATER LIKE MY PERSONALITY MY ENTHUSIASM SO AGOT THE PERSONALITY CARD COMING OUT OF THAT MUSIC ADDITION GREAT UM AND WHAT HE DID AS HE SAID LOOK I'M WITH YOU I DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE READY YOU WOULD NOT GET INTO JULIARD IF YOU OUGHT DITION TO DAY HOWEVER I TAKE RESIDENCE AT A SUMMER MUSIC PROGRAM IN COLORADO IF YOU COME THERE FOR FIVE WEEKS WE CAN DO IN INTENSE BOOT CAMP WHERE I TRY TO SKILL YOU OF AND GET YOU TO LEARN LIKE YOUR FIRST SCALE IN YOUR FIRST AE HUD WHICH YOU'LL MEED TO PASS THE JULIARD ADITION AND ALSO MABE HELEFULLY GET YOU TO LIKE READ MUSIC A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU CAN WRITE NOW AND I WENT TO THAT SUMMER CAMP AND I WORKED MY BUT OFF I MEAN YOU'RE ALSO IN THIS INCREDIBLY INTENSIVE ENVIRONMENT WERE EVERY ONE YOUR AGE IS THERE AN THEY'RE ALL PRACTISING LIKE THEIR AGE EQUIVALENTS RIT A INCS I FELT VERY INSPIRED BY THAT AND I ENDED OF GETTING INTO JULIARD IN THE FALL AND IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL REMINDER THAT YOU KNOW WHEN OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT SERVED ON A SILVER PLATTER FOR YOU YOU JUST HAD TO HAVE THIS KIND OF IMAGINE TIVE COURAGE AND WHAT MY MAM HAD THAT DAY RIT TO FIGURE OUT A PATH FROM PO Y A NADA POINT THE SHE REALLY JUST LIKE CREATED A PLATE FOR ME AND SAID LIKE O QE LIKE YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THIS THING FOR GINGTO GET YOU IN FRONT OF THIS TEACHER AND THAT'S A LESSON I USE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN I FELT LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING COOL I COULD BE DOING THE OPPORTUNITY DID NOT EXIST AM SOFOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE THE THE JOB THAT I WANTED WHICH WAS AH TO BE A PRACTITIONER OF THE HEVRAL SCIENCE DID NOT EXIST AND SO I SENT COLLY MELLS AND I PITCH THEM ON THE IDEA OF CREATING A NEW PHYSICIAN FOR A BEHEVREAL SCIENCE ADVISER AND THEN I SAID HEY BY THE WAY IF YOU CREATE THIS PHYSICIAN COULD YOU LIKE ALSO CONSIDER HIRING ME TO PLAY THAT JOB OVE KNOW I HAD NO PUBLIC POLICY EXPERIENCE AND I'VE BEEN AN ACADEMIC AH FOR THE TIREDY OF MY DULT LIFE AND YOU NOW THEY SAID YES AND SO IT'S IT'S JUST IT IT WAS SUCH AN ENERGIZING LESSON TO LEARN AS A YOUNG KID WHICH IS LIKE YOU CAN DO THE COLD CALL OFTENTIMES THERE IS FEW CONSEQUENCES YOU'LL JUST GET REJECTED AN THAT'S TRULY THE WORST THING THATS CAN HAPPEN BUT IT'S ONE THING TO BE TOLD THAT AS ANOTHER THING TO HAVE LIVED THE EXPERIENCE OUT IN TO SEE HOW AMAZING AH THE AFTERMATH CAN BE AND THAT'S THE THAT'S WHAT I GOT TO EXPERIENCEAS YOUNG KID SO AMAZING AND AM SO LET'S ALL EXPRESS SOME THANKS TO YOUR MOM FOR BARTING N E DOOR AH AND TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAD THE AGENCY TO TO DO THE ODDITION ON THE SPOT I THINK A LOT OF KIDS AN ADULTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU I'M NOT READY NOT GOING TO DO THIS BUT IT IT TAKES IT AM CERTAIN GUMPTION TO JUST DO IT RIGHT AN AND ALSO TO INTEGRATE THE FEED BACK AND THEN I'M CURES ABOUT THIS CAMP YA I WENT TO A FEU CAMPS OF DIFFERENT TYPES I'M CRASHED A YEW CAMPS SUCH A DIFFERENT STORY TURNS OT IF YOU SHOW UP YOU N GET BY FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE THEY REALIZEG  I WN ANI ANI THAT THI'S AE WHOLE OTHER SAYS STORY THER I WAT OM BUT I'M CURIOUS YOU KNOW YOUR YOURE AMONG VERY DRIVEN IM MAYBE EVEN OBSESSIVE KIDS YE I'M WERE THEY NICE TO ONE ANOTHER AM DO YOU RECALL THE KID THAT WAS THE BEST AAN ME UALLY THAT THERE YOU GO HII INCREDIBLE OH MY G REMEMBER THESE N TON PRODIGY I I BRISTLE WHEN PEOPLE SAY LIKE OH MUT LIKE MYA WAS A YOUNG VIOLIN PRODIGY AND LIKE NO I WASN'T AND THERE'S NO FALSE HUMILITY AND MY SAYING THAT I JUST ACTUALLY SAW WHAT PRODIGIES WERE LIKE AND I WAS NOT ONE OF THEM I MEAN TRULY JUST TALK ABOUT AW INSPIRING AND LIKE HOW IS IT THAT MUSIC COMES SO EFFORTLESSLY TO RACHEL I FEEL LIKE SHE I FEEL SHE WAS BORN WITH A VIOLIN IN HER HANDS VAND THAT'S HOW IT FELT WHENEVER I WATCHED HER PLAY AND IT'S A DOUBLE LEDGE SORT ON THE ONE HAND YOU DRIVED YOUR DERIVING INSPIRATION FROM THE INCREDIBLE TALENT YOU SEE AROUND YOU ON THE OTHER HAND YOU FEEL DEMORALIZED SO OFTEN BECAUSE YOUERE RUNNING UP AGAINST WHATEVER OUT LIMITATIONS EXISTS WHEN IT COMES HERE NATURAL TALENT AND YOUR WORK ETHIC LIKE AT THE END OF THE DAY I WAS NEVER THE HARDEST WORKING VIOLINIST MY MAM INSISTED THAT WE WERE WELL ROUND A KIDS I PLAYED SOCKER ALL THROUGH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I OUDITION FOR THE SCHOOL PLAY A REALLY ROSY I DID ART CLASSES LIKE IT WAS JUST REALLY IMPORTANT O UKNOW BOTH MY PARENTS I THINK THAT WE HAD JUST LIKE RELATIVELY NORMAL LIVES AND I WAS STUDDING ALONGSIDE KIDS WHO HAD LITERALLY LEFT HALF THEIR FAMILIES BEHIND IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY HAD MOVED WITH ONE PARENT TO A STUDIO APARTMEN IN MANHATTON OR IN COLORADO FOR THIS CAMP AND WERE DEVOTING THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO THIS PURSUIT AND SO I FELT LIKE AM I WAS I WAS JUST SUPER ENVIOUS KID LIKE I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING AROUND BEING LIKE I SUCK IN THEIR GRAT RIGHT WE TALKED ABOUT LIKE HAVING A SELF CRITICAL PERSONALITY I GI A LOT OING A LOT OF KIDS FEEL THAT WAY Y WERE I THING AT THAT AGE AND THE SOMETIMES EXTENDS INTO ADULTHOD UM WE HAVE THIS TENDENCY TO TRUN THE FUN BENTH MARKS OF WHERE WE ARE YE YOU KNOW AND AND SOMETIMES THAT'S BOT YOU NO TURNS INTO A HIERARCHICAL THINGS OF MANS VERY LA ATERALAGE BUT TURN A FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU AREN THE LANDSCAPE WITH THINGS IS SUNDGENCE A FUNDAMENTAL THE TEA NAGE EXPERIENCE YIM ON UNIVERSE SHRINKS TOO RIGHT SO LIKE YOU'RE NO LONGER GETTING ACCESS TO WHAT THE AVERAGE KID VIOLINA SOUNDS LIKE I'M EU'RE IN THE ELEETE OF THE ELEETE AND SO IT'S SO INTIMIDATING AND I OFTEN FELT I FELT LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IS ESPECIALLY WHEN I BECAME THE TEA NATURE SUH TWO THINGS HAPPENED WHEN I BECAME A TEA NATURE THE FIRST IS THAT MY VIOLIN LIFE JOST STARTED TO SPEED FOR IT SO A IT'S OT PERLMAN INVITING ME TO BE HIS PRIVATE MY LIND STUDENT YOU KNOW CONSIDER THE BEST VIOLINISTS IN THE WORLD IT WAS US N INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE I FELT SO OVERWHELMED EVEN BY THE OPPORTUNITY I'D ALSO STUMBLED UPON EMPTY VE AND WAS LIKE TO IVEN WANTED TO CLASSCHAL MUSIC LIKE BRITNEY SPHERES IS DOING LICH CHOOLERS THANKS T T IE LI WAS MY VERSION OF LIKE TEA NAGE REBELLIOND WAS COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL AND WHAT I SHOULDHAVE EEN PRACTISING WATCHING EMTEETY A BUT THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED IS Y WENT THROUGH THE NATURAL TEAN AGE PROCESS WHICH AS I BECAME VERY SELF CONSCIOUS AM I BECAME MORE INSECURE I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO I WAS WHO I AM AND I THINK THAT WAS THE PERIOD OF MY LIFE MY MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS WHEN I WAS THE LEAST HAPPY AS A VIOLINESS SO I DESCRIBED TO YOU EARLIER THAT INCREDIBLY AWE INSPIRING EXPERIENCE OF LISTENING TO I THE VATOF AN VIOLEN CONCHERITO AND IT FEELING OTHER WORLDLY AND FEELING LIKE I COULD SEE A WORLD BEYOND MY OWN PERSONAL WANTS AND NEEDS AND DESIRES RIAD IT REALLY MADE ME FEEL SMALL AGAINST THE BACKDRUP OF THIS MAGNIFICENT WORLD AND I LIKED THAT FEELING OF SMALLNESS AND WHEN I WAS IN MY TEAN AGE YEARS YOU KNOW WERE ALL IN THIS HIGHLY NARSISISTIC STATE OF MIND WERE LIKE CONSUMED WITH OURSELVES AND HOW WE FEEL AND I JUST I JUST FELT LIKE I GAVE SOME OF MY WORST PERFORMANCES WHEN I WAS A TEA NATURE AND I OFTEN FOUND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT AM YOUKNOW THESE PRESSURE COOKER ENVIRONMENTS MY BEST PERFORMANCEERS WERE ACTUALLY JUST TO THE PUBLIC MY WORST PERFORMANCES WERE WHEN I WAS IN MY LITTLE STUDIO HAVING TO PLAY FOR MY PIERS LIKE THAT JUST SOUPD ALL THE JOY OUT FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS YES JUS LIKE REALLY TOUGH ON MYSELF AND I I LOST THAT WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE I LOST TOUCH WITH WHAT IT IS THAT I LOVED ABOUT MUSIC AND ON OF COURSE THERE'S AN EBEN FLOW I HAD MAGICAL EXPERIENCES PLYING THE VIOLEN WHEN I WAS HIGH SCHOOLERE BUT I JUST THINKING YOU WERE TO DO LIKE THE AVERAGE OF JOY LIKE PREE TWELVE AND THEN POST TWELVE THE AVERAGE JOY WAS MUCH HIGHER I A FORITY CAME INTO NATER THE OTHERS THERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO EXTRAPLAY FROM THAT I I REALLY FEEL THAT WHEN WE GET INTO A MODE OF TRYING TO HITMILESTONES THAT ARE EXTRANSIC THAT IT REALLY CAN UNDER MINE ART ARE LOVE OF YA OF WHAT WE'RE DOING BUT THAT IF WE KEEP GOING AND WE CAN REFRAME WHAT THOSE EXTERNAL REWARDS ARE AN IN PART BY JUST REALIZING THAT THEY ARE SO TRANSIENT COMPARED TO THE THE DELIGHT THAT WE CAN EXPERIENCE WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I DON'T THINK OF DELIGHT AS SOMETHING THAT THE WELLS UP AN OSTEN AND AND THEN DISSIPATES I THINK OF IT IS SOMETHING THAT CHANGES OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT GIVES US ACCESS TO NEW ABILITIES I REALLY DO I MADE BEING A FACTS O MUMBER IT STAMFORD IT YEN YOU LOOKE O YERE LEFT YOU LOOK HERE RIOTENCE LIKE I LITERALLY IN THE BUILDING I MAN I'VE GOT NOBLE PRIZE WENT OR BELON ME LIKE THE PEOPLE BY A MCARTHUROWORD WINNER'S ALL  PLACE LIKE EVERYORE YOU TURN AND THESE PEOPLE DO OTHER THINGS TO SO LIKE YOU NO OA AL ALSO D ONE ATHLETES ANDTHEYVE GOT FIVE KIDS AND ALL THEIR KIDS SEEM TO BE DOING GREAT AN LIKE WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE AND IT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT TO UM TO JUST SHRINK YOUR SPERES LIKE WHAT'S YOU KNOW ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THEU ARNUS KEEP GOING AN NOT PAY ATTENTION BUT IT'S HARD TO DO NOT BY WAY OF COMPARISON CAUSE ACTUALLY GET EXCITED ABOUT BEING INIMMERSED IN A GROUP OF WEVERONS DOING WELL I DO THINK BEING AMONG ALL THESE OTHER INCREDIBLY TALENTED AND DRIVEN ALTHOUGH YOU YOU CAREFULLY SAID AND IMPORTANTLY SAID RATHER THAT YOU DID NOT SEE YOURSELF AS TALENTED IT'S VERY CLEARLY OF A TON OF GRIT AND AND HARD WORK CLEARLY WENT INTO IT I THINK THAT WERE TALENT CAN BE  BIT MISLEADING SO UM WE WANT OT O UNDERSCORE THE FACT E'VE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD UM BUT I THINK THAT IT'S A TOUGH THING YOU KNOW I IT'S HARD FOR US TO DEVELOP MUCH AN ISOLATION AND IT'S ALSO HARD FOR US TO A MISTAKE CONNECTED TO THE SOURCE YE I LERNT WERE EXACT AND THAT'S A WORD THAT I STOLE FROM A A FORMER GUEST ON THIS PODCAST AN AND A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE HIS UM THE GREAT RICK REUBEN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MUSIC YE I SIR ROCKERONE O TATITEBALE HE GIS AT OUT THE SOURCE YOU KNOW UM SO THEREIS SO MANY DIFFERENT UM TRAILS WE COULD GO DOWN HERE JUST ONE THING BRIEFLY IS I I U AGAIN COMPLETELY MISERABLE A AT MUSIC BUT I ONCE SAWT YOU SUCK PROMAN IN THE IN THE IRREPORT WITH HIS FAMILY I WAS WITH MY FATHER WHO'S A HUGE CLASSICAL MUSANA AND WE WATCHED HIM AND HE SAID WATCH AND WHO TURNS OUT HE WAS GETTING ON TO OURPLANE HE SAT IN FIRST CLASS NEXT TO HIS I PRESUME STRATEBERY SMILIN HIS VIOLIN GOT A FIRST CLASS HE GOT A FIRST CLASS HE IN HIS FAMILY SAT ACROSS FROM IM IN MY DAD SAID HIS VIOLIN IS SO IMPORTANT THAT I GETS ITS OWN FIRST CLASS HE I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT UM VRS N IN ANY EVENT UM I THINK JUST ONE THING TO YOUR TOUR POINT UM ONE REFLECTION I'VE HAD IT AND THIS KIND IT GOES BACK TO THIS QUESTION OF IDENTITY RIGHT WHICH IS WHEN YOU ARE IN THESE VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND AGAT I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING ARE IN VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS UM YOU FEEL THAT SO MUCH CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU A JUST IN TERMS OF MENTAL WEALL BEING BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE WORLD THROUGH A COMPARATIVE LENS WRIGT YOUR YER BENCH MARKING YOURSELF AS YOU SAI LIKE THIS VENCH MARGAN WHERE DO I FALL ON THE CONTINUAN OF YOU KNOW MEDIOGRE DE GRATE I DON'T KNOW AND YESTERDAYI I I DID IT HAD A TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE THAT US CAN SENT ME BACK ET CETER ET CETERA UM I HAVE FOUND THAT WHEN I'VE ANCHORED WHEN I REANCHOR MYSELF TO IT YOU KNOWT WHAT RICK REBEN REFERRED TO IS THE SOURCE AND IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS UM O MUSIC OR OTHER PURSUITS THAT REALLY ENERGIZES ME IT FEELS LIKE IM ACTUALLY INSOLATED FROM A LOT OF THE EXTR ARNAL NOISE AND I BRING A LOT MORE CLARITY AND FOCUSS TO THE WORK THAT I DO EVERYDAY SO THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I THINK TO FIND ME AS A PERSON A AT LEAST RIGHT NOW WRIGHT I ALLOW FOR THAT VALUABILITY A ONE IS THAT I'M A DEEPLY CURIOUS PERSON AND THE SECOND IS THAT I REALLY RELISH GETTING BETTER AT THINGS I LOVE SEEING PROGRESS INTERNALLY AND IN MY VIOLIN LIFE A NO ONE COULD TAKE THOSE TWO THINGS AWAY FROM ME IN MY CURRENT LIFE AM AS A COGNIT OF SCIENTISTS AS A PODCASTER LIKE YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE THOSE FROM ME LIKE NO ONE CAN TAKE THOSE THAT JOY FROM ME AND IT FEELS PROTECTIVE IN A REALLY IMPORTANT WAY WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN I I PORSE I MEAN JUST LIKE YOU I MEAN I SEE THE LABOUR OF LOVE THAT YOU PUT INTO THE HUVOURAN LAPPOCAST IT'S EXTRAORDINARY I POK I PUT SO MUCH TIME AN ENERGY AND THOUGHTFULNESS AND LOVE INTO MAKING A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS BUT AT THE END OF A DAY WHEN YOU PUT THE EPISODE OUT INTO THE WORLD LIKE YOU JUST DON'T GET TO CONTROL WHAT THE REACTION IS RIGHT YOUR FAVOURITE EPISODE MIGHT NOT BE EVERY ONE ELSE'S FAVORITE EPISODE AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIGHT BUT WHAT I FOUND IS THAT IF I REALLY RELISH THE PROCESS OF MAKING THE EPISODE WRIT FED THAT CURIOSITY AND I GOT BETTER AS AN INTERVIEWER I GOT BETTER AS A THINKER I GOT MORE CLARITY ON A TOPIC THAT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT I MEAN ITJUST IT GIVES ME A FOUNDATION THAT FEELS REALLY STURDY YOU KNOWHAT I MEAN  JUST THE A WELL THOSE THINGS ARE INTRINSIC TO YOU AND THE THEY ARE A I GUST NOW WERE ESUUSING O NOMONCLATURE BUT THEY'RE NOT WELL WE CALL DOMAIN SPECIFIC LIKE THE CURIOSITY THAT THE DESIRE FOR PROGRESS THROUGH EFFORT AND THROUGH A FOCUS A THOSE ARE MUSIC A THEY'RE NOT MUSIC IRRELEVANT BUT THEIR MUSIC INDEPENDENT AM AND IN THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS ME TO A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF YOUR WORK AND AND YOUR LIFE WARK WHICH IS A THIST NOTION OF RECREATING AND REFINDING IDENTITY IN NEW ENDEAVORS SO I IF I UNDERSTAND U'N CRECTLY AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL EMBELLISH ON THIS AM YOU HAD THE UNFORTUNATE PERHAPS UNUNFORTUNATE I A EXPERIENCE OF PLAYING THE VIOLIN AND THEN INJURING YOUR FINGER VERY BADLY TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS AT LEAST FOR YOUR MUSIC CAREER CAREER ENDING ASSENTLY AND THAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE HOWLD I WAS FIFTEEN SO GIVEN HOW MUCH OF YOUR IDENTITY AND AN ENERGY WAS A PUT IN TO VIOLIN THAT THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING AND YET YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY A I DUNLESS THEY RECREATED YOURSELF BECAUSE I LIKE THE IDEA THAT THIS ESSENCE WITHIN YOU A HAS MANY OPPORTUNITIES INFORMS AND I LIKE IT AS AN EXAMPLE FOR EVERYBODY HAVING SOME ESSENCE OF MANY THINGS THAT COULD GIVE THEM DELIGHT AM AND THAT IT 'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE FEELINGS ASSOCIATED WITH A GIVEN CHOICE OF OCCUPATION OR HOBBY YOUR BEHAVIOR OR PERHAPS RELATIONSHIP MIGHT RELATIONSHIPS AND SOMETIMES BY DECISION DEATH OR OTHERWISE YANO AND PEOPLE ARE DEVASTATED THEIR IDENTITIES ARE COMPLETELY AT LEAST IN THEIR MINDS OBLITERATED AND THEN PEOPLE HAVE THIS AMAZING ABILITY A RECREATE THEMSELVES AND NEW CIRCUMSTANCES SO F YOU COULD TAKE US BACK TO THE TIME WHEN YOURE FIFTEEN YOU HAVE THIS INJURY WHAT WAS YOUR INITIAL MIND SET IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AFTER THAT E AND THEN IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU LINK THAT UP TO SOME OF THE WHAT I SEE AS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND NOT JUST WHO THEY ARE BUT HADI IDENTIFY THE COMPONENTS WHO THEY ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE TRULY INDOMITABLE THAT THEY THAT JUST CANNOT GO AWAY YE LIKE YOUR DRIVE FOR CURIOSITY  AND HARD WOR A HUMAN CONNECTION YET AM YET IN IN THE DAYS IN WEEKS AND MONTHS AND YEAR AFTER I I FELT TERRIBLE IT WAS AWFUL BECAUSE AM I DON'T I THINK IN MY CASE ALL SAY YO JUST WHEN IURICATE IS REALLY LIKE BUVILY AND ENERGETIC T JUST KIND OF MOVE FORWARD AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS THINK ABOUT HOW IDENTITY TOFINDING THE THING YOU'RE DOING IS YOU JUST DO IT AND SO IT'S IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING I THINK IN LOSING THE VIOLIN THAT'S ACTUALLY WHEN IT BECAME SO SALIENT TO ME HOW MUCH THE INSTRUMENT HAD MEANT TO ME AND AND HAD TO FIND WHO I WAS AND SO I I FELT A DAMPENING OF SOME OF MY MORE ORGANIC TRAITS LIKE I WAS LESS CURIOUS FOR A LONG TIME COULD AT IMN INTERRUPT YOU ON APRPIST I APOLOGIZED BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND I'M NOT UPOOGICK AS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID IN A PRIOR DISCUSSION THAT JUST KEEPS RINGING IN MY MIND WHICH IS AT YOUR BODY AND YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTUALLY GREW UP AROUND THE VIOLIN EAT THAKE THAT TO ME WICH JUS I I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT STATEMENT I WONTT ALSO THANK YOU FOR IT BECAUSE THAT TO ME IS PERHAPS THE MOST PROFOUND WAY TO DESCRIBE A AN EXPERIENCE OF IDENTITY IS THAT YOUR YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY ISN'T GOWING UP WITH SOMETHING OR ALONG SIDE IT BUT THAT MUCH LIKE A AA RELATIONSHIP O OF A HUMAN KIND HUMAN HUMAN KIND THAT YOUR BODY IS ACTUALLY DEVELOPING AROUND THIS OBJECT IT ABSOLUTELY DEVELOPED AROUND THE ERGONOMICS OF PLAYING THE VIOLIN SO TO THIS DAY MY RIGHT SHOULDER IS SLIGHTLY ELEVATED TO MY LATA RELATIVE TO MY LEFT BECAUSEOF ALL THE HOURS I SPENT DOING THIS IT MAKES STRENGTH TRAINING REALLY ANNOYING BES I ALWAYS HAVE THE SLIGHT ON BALANCE AND I HAVE A LIGHT SCOLIOSIS AND MY FINE AS WELL ALSO FROM THIS POSTUR AND IM YET FEELS INTIMATE IN A WAY IT'S LIKE WELL THAT THE SHAPE OF MY BODY RIGHT LIKE MY ARCHITECTURE WAS DEFINED BY THIS INSTRUMENT AND SO IT IT'S LEFT IN UNDENOT IT'S LIKE A IT'S LEFT TITS INDELIBLE YOU KNOW IT HAS I ITS LOVE IS LIKE IMPRINT ON ME THAT WILL NEVER GO AWAY AND I'M I THINK THAT A LOT OF US FEEL THIS THIS DISORIENTATION RIGHTS SO IT'S MIGHT NOT E THAT YOU LOST THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING YOU LOVE IT COULD BE THAT YOU LOST SOME ONE THAT YOU LOVE RIGHT IT COULD BE THAT YOU UM YOU LOST YOUR MOJO DEVER  THERE'S SO MANY TYPES OF LOSS AND SO MANY KINDS OF GRIEF WE ALL EXPERIENCE AS HUMAN BEINGS AND I THINK IN ALL THOSE CASES AGAIN IT REALLY FEELS LIKE THE RUG HAS BEEN PULLED OUT FROM UNDER YOU BECAUSE THIS THING THAT GAVE YOU SO MUCH MEETING AND SO MUCH PURPOSE AND SO MUCH ENERGY IN LIFE NO LONGER EXISTS AND SO I THINK FOR FOR A WHILE YET I FELT KIND OF LIKE LOST AT SEE AND UM I ASSUMED I'LL NEVER FIND ANYTHING THAT I'M AS PASSIONATE ABOUT AND UM I THN WHAT MY DAD DID FOR ME AT THAT TIME SO YOUKNO THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS SO HE'S AN ACADAMTIC AND HE SAID I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST READ A LOT S LIKE READ A BUNCH OF STUFF AND UM I WAS LIKE O QE I MEAN I'M SOS TO BE IN CHINA THIS SUMMER TOURING WITH MY CLASS MATES I AM AT HOME IN CONNETIGATE MY PARENTS A PERUSING THEIR BOOKSHELVS SO LIKE SLIGHTLY LEST COOL SUMMER SITUATION THAT YOU KNOT LOT OF TIME ON MY HANDS AS I WASN'T I WASN'T IN SHENGHAI UMS I STARTED YOU KNOW PRUSING THE BOOKSHELF AND THEN I CAME ACROSS THIS POP SCIENCE BOOK CALLED THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT BY STEPHEN PINKER AND A THAT WAS A TURNING POINT FOR ME I MEAN I WAS I WAS HEADED TO COLLEGE MAY BE LATER THAT YER AH I OPENED UP THIS BOOK AND IT DETAILED ARE MARVELOUS ABILITY TO COMPREHEND AND PRODUCED LANGUAGE AND UP UNTIL THIS POINT IN MY LIFE ID COMPLETELY TAKEN LANGUAGE ABILITIES FOR GRANTED JUST LIKE SOMETHING THAT I DID AN IAT JUST LIKE KIND OF LEARNED IT ALONG THE WAY AND WHEN PINKER PULLED THE CURTAIN BACK AN REVEALED HOW SOTPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX THE COGNATAND MACHINERY IS THAT'S OPERATING THE BEHIND THE SCENES THAT GIVES RISE TO LANGUAGE MY MIND WAS TRULY BLOWN I WAS LIKE WOW I I NEVER THOUGHT OF AT IT SOMETHING BE WITH THREE YEAR O AS NOT LIKE WE SIT DOWN WAT THEM WERE LIKE THIS IS A GERAN THIS IS A PASSPART WHATEVER THEY DON'T THEY JUST LEARN BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE KIND OF LIGHTS WHICH IS IN THEIR BRAIN THAT ARE YOU KNOW ACTUDATED ON AND OFF DEPENDING OT WHAT LANGUAGES ARE LEARNING AND IT WAS SO FASCINATING TO LEARN ABOUT LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT ABOUT NEURW LINGUISTICS OM ABOUT SYNTAX AND SYNANTICS AND AND SO I I JUST REMEMBER THINKIN LANGUAGES FASCINATING COGNITION IS FASCINATING AND I'M ALLSO NOW WONDERING ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE RIGHT SO THIS IS WHAT'S INVOLVED IN LANGUAGE WAT'S INVOLVED IN OM YOU'RE THE COMPLEX NATHOQUATIONS ARE DADS DO RIGHT LIKE WHAT'S INVOLVED IN IM WWHA WHAT'S THE MENTAL PROCESSING BEHIND AND YOU DISCOVERY OR AN INSITER AND A HAMOMENT OR FALLING IN LOVE OR FALLING OUT OF LOVE ND E IT JUST IT JUST LIT UP MY IMAGINATION AN VERY SIMILAR TO YOU AND YOUR I LOVE THAT WE HAVE THIS CONNECTION YOU SAIY WHEN YOU LEARNED ABOUT LIKE NAURO BIOLOGY IN NAUROW SCIENCE YOU YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A PLACE FOR YOURSELF IN THERE AND I REMEMBER READING THIS BOOK AND BECAUSE IT WAS A POP SCIENCE BOOK AND I LOVE POP SCIENCE BOOKS CA SAND IES NOW EVEN IF THEY DON'T FULLY DO JUSTICE TO THE SCIENCE THEY CAN TAKE SOME ONE WHO'SE NEVER HAD ANY EXPOSURE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER AND IT'S IT'S THRILLING TO LEARN ABOUT THE THING RIGHT I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTIN THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT I OPENED UP AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNAT OF SCIENCE TEXT BOOK KT WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE SAME INFECT ON TE SO LIKE SHOUT OUT POPSIE S EVERYWHERE THANK YOU FOR SAYING  AND AN  ON HERE I'LL JUST THANK YOU BECAUSE I THINK THAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN ECADEMIC SCIENCE AS STAMFORD AND ELSEWERE FEEL THAT WAY BUT I THINK MANY DON'T THEY THINK OF IT IS QUOTE DUMBING DOWN OF THINGS BUT I'LL TELL YOU UM RARELY IF EVER DOS SOMEBODY JUST WANDERING TO A UNIVERSY CLASS ROOMIN HERE A LECTURE ON AIDEN IM  MAYBE F YOUR MAM WAS A HELMS YOU I WOD YOUR MALMS EVERYWHERE AR RIHT AND UM WHAT BUT I THINK IT'S UM I ACTUALLY I'LL I'LL GO STEP FURTHER AND I'L IL A DO THIS SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO AND TAT THESE ARE NOT YOUR WORDS THES ARE M IND I THINK THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY IT A PRETTY INTENSE ARROGANCE TO THE IDEA WITHIN THE A ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THAT POP SCIENCE BOOKS WHILE THEY MIGHT NOT BE EXHAUSTIVE PROVIDED THEIR ACCURATE AND THEIRE MAKING ATTEMPT TO EDUCATE AND DRAW PEOPLE IN FROM ALL SECTORS YE A AMEN TO THAT I JUST CAN'T HERE A COUNTER ARGUMENT IN MY HEAD OR ELSEWHERE WHERE THAT'S NOT ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT A PEOPLE CAN DO SO A REGARDLESS OF A YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S MOTIVATIONS FOR PICKING HEM UP IN THE FIRST PLACE I MN THEY BROUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO THE THE CURIOSITY AND DELIGHT THAT IS SCIENCE OR MUSIC OR YOU KOW I THINK THAT WE THE MORSE A POSITIVE BENEVOLENT YOU KNOW SAFE SENSORY EXPERIENCES THAT WE CAN EXPOSE YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE GREATER PROBABLY THAT WERE GOING TO FLESH OUT THOSE PROFESSIONS WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF DIVERSE MINDS OR GAN HAVE THE BEST IDEAS I MEANTS REALLY I I THINK THAT THERE IS A TON OF FORESIGHT IN WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING THAT THE PICKING UP A BOOK IS NOW WHAT YOURE ALSO NOW I PICHTY IN IT OMING IN COGNA SCIENCE AND E DID OU POSTAC AT STAND FOR AM YOUR SCIENCIST A PRESUME BECAUSE YEU WENT INTO THE BOOKSHELF AND PICKED UP THAT BOOK HUNDRED PERCENT AN I I THINK IT WAS IT WAS ALSO ROLE MOVELE FOR ME BECAUSE MY DAD DISLIKE BEING IN A VERY VERY TECHNICAL FEEL SPENT A LARGE PART OF HIS CAREER ACTUALLY WORKING ON THE TRANSLATION OF COMPLEX SUBJECTS AN TRYING TO CONVAD THEM TO GENERAL AUDIENCES AN I LOVED WITNESSINNESS CAUS IF I YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THEORETICAL PHYSIPHYSICS TO A GENERAL AUDIENCE I MEAN WILE THAT'S A MASTERFUL PERCY RY FINEMEN RICHARD FON YAVERIGEAR FIND MEN EXACTLY NO ONE THAT REALLY KNOWS WHAT FIMEN DID FOR HIS NOBLE PRIZE WORK EXCEPT PHYSICIS YOU KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE YES WHAT WHAT WAS FINDMENS NO WELL WHERN THE LIKE I DON'T AT O O O O LAAS DOES ANY BOUT BIRDS AND TASTINOME AND NOW IT'S LESS INTERESTING THAN YOU KNOW QUANTO MECHANICS WEALIA AND I AND AT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I LOVE YOU REMENLAD THAT I I JUST LOVE THE WORK YOU DO IS THAT YOU ARE TAKING A CONCEPTS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN INACCESSIBLE TO THE AVERAGE PERSON AND YOUR MAKING SCIENCE ACCESSIBLE AND I FEEL SO MUCH GRATITUDE TO EVERY SCIENTIST OUT THERE EVERY RESEARCHER OUT THERE WHO THINKS THAT IT'S WORTH THEIR TIME TO BE A PRACTITIONER OF OF THEIR WORK AM BECAUSE ULTIMATELY AND YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MANY LIVES YOUARE CHANGING THROUGH THE SHOW BY TRYING TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THESE MORE COMPLICATED THINGS INTO AM INTO CONCEPTS OT PEOPLE CAN YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND A RELATE TO AND ACTUALLY ACT ON AND A IT ALL SURMISED ME KNOW AN PART OF MY JOB WHEN I WAS IN WHEN I WAS IN THE ABOMA ADMINISTRATION WAS TRANSLATING INSIGHTS FROM BEHAVIOURALE SCIENCE FROM COGMENTOF SCIENCE INTO INTERVENTIONS THAT MY GOVERNMENT AGENTS E COLLAGUES HAD IMPLEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN'S AFFAIRS IN THE IN A DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DEPARTMEN OF EDUCATION AND THAT SAME TRANSLATION PROCESS WIS PART OF THAT EFFORT TO AND I I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD TO DO WELL I RESPECT IT SO MUCH I RESPECT POP SCIENCE WRITERS WHO DO A GOOD JOBS SO MUCH AM AND YA I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL SERVICE THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND THEIR TIME WRITING THESE BOOKS THEY COULD JUST PUBLISH MORE RESEARCH PAPER IS THAT IT WHICH IS THE CURRENCY THAT ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS CARE ABOUT AND SO I SEE IT IS JUST LIKE A PUBLIC GOOD WHAT THEY'RE DOING N I DO TOO AND RET THACK AT

CENT OFF SO I WANTED AM GO BACK TO THIS THINJURY TO SUMMER AT HOME TO DISCOVERY OF SOMETHING NEW T WAS IT AT THAT POINT THAT YOU REALIZED AH THE FEELING OF EXCITEMENT THAT I'M GETTING FROM LEARNING ABOUT NERLINGUISTIX AND RELATED TOPICS IS SOMEHOW SIMILAR TO THE EXCITEMENT THAT I WAS FEELING ABOUT THE VIOLIN OR MAYBE EVEN SUPERSEDED THAT EXCITEMENT A MEAN AT WHAT POINT DID WERE YOU ABLE TO MAKE THE PIVOT WITH CONFIDENCE THAT YON THIS THIS IS THE NEUTRAJECTORY YAN AND AN IMPORTANT UM COMPONET OF THAT THAT I LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IS YOU ALSO HAD TO CUT TIES WITH THE PAST SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HARD TO DO I MAN I GO UP WITH A NUMBER OF KITS WHO BECAME VERY SUCCESSFUL TEEN ATHLETES REALLY AND SOME OF THEM ONCE THEY SEASE TO KEEP UP OR AT AN INJURY OR SOMETHING THEIR IDENTITY STAYED ATTACHED TO THE PAST IN A WAY THAT DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO MOVE FORWARD FORTUNATELY MANY OF THEM I'M DID FIND NEW IDENTITIES IN BUSINESS OR IN OTHER ENDEAVORS IM SOME BECAME QUITE SUCCESSFUL BUT I'VE I'V IS SEEM VERY OFTEN THAT WHEN PEOPLE ACHIEVE EARLY SUCCESS AND THEN THEY HIT A CLIFF THAT IT'S VERY HARD FOR THEM TO PART WITH THAT FORMER IDENTITY THIR'S ONE OF THE PERILS OF EARLY SUCCESS YE AN I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IT SUPERCEDIV THE EXCITEMENT THAT I HAD AT THE VIOLIN I WOULD SAY THE QUALITY THE EXCITEMENT FELT VERY DIFFERENT AND THAT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO CONVEY CAUSE I THINK WHEN SOME ONE LOSES THE ABILITY TO HAVE A PASSION THE'R SEEKING EXACTLY THE SAME CENSORY EXPERIENCE EXACTLY THE SAME HIGH THAT THEY EXPERIENCED THE FIRST TIME AROUND AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY HIGH BAR AND SOMETIMES IT'S HE MORE OF AN APPLES AND ORANGE'S TYPED SITUATION SO WITH THE VIOLIN THERE WAS A REALLY DEEP CENSORY ASPECT TO THE EXPERIENCE I MEAN I I FELT THINGS RIHT YOU'RE PLAYING AND THEN YOUR FEELING THINGS EMOTIONALLY AND IT IT ALL FELT SUPERVICERAL AND THAT WAS WHERE THE PASSION EMERGE FROM IT WAS JUST JUST LIKE VERY VICERAL FEELING OF LIKE THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND AWESOM AND I LOVE IT WITH THE COGNIT OF SCIENCE STUFF MI MY INTELLECTUAL BRAIN WAS DELIGHTED AND JUST LIKE A DIFFERENT EXPRESSION OF PASSION RIGHT I I THINK THE BIG PRESSURE TASK WAS NOT IF I HELD MYSELF TO THE BARB DO I LOVE THIS AS MUCH AS THE VIOLIN THERE'S NO WAY THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO PURSUE ANYTHING AT THAT POINT SO INSTEAD I I REALLY THINK THE QUESTION I ASK MYSELF AT THAT TIME WHICH WAS A SERVICE TO ME IND IN MY MORE COMPROMISED PSYCHOLOGY WAS AM I CURIOUS ENOUGH ABOUT THIS THING TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT DO I WANT TO LEARN MORE AND I FOUND NATURALLY THREE DAYS LATER I WENT TO THE A LIBRARY AND I GOT ANOTHER BOOK ON THE COGDIT A SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE AND THEN I GOT A BOOK ON THE SCIENCE OF DECISION MAKING SO I WAS THERE WAS CURIOSITY AND HONESTLY THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED THAT WAS THE LITTLE SEED LING THAT I NEEDED TO SEE IF IT COULD GO SOMEWHERE MORE AM I TOOK AT AS A VERY STRONG SIGNAL LIKE I CARE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS AND I DON'T CARE TO LEARN ABOUT EVERYTHING RIGHT AND AM I REMEMBER PERUSING THE COARSE BOOK A OF MY OF MY UNDERGRAT INSTITUTION AND THEY HAD A COGNIT OFE SCIENCE MAJOR WHICH WAS AWESOM BECAUSE NOT ALL SCHOOLS HAD ONE AT THE TIME IS A VERY NEW MAJOR AS INTERDISCIPLINARY YOU APPROAC QUESTIONS OF THE MIND FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVE SO ON FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF NARROW SCIENCE LINGUISTICS PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AM COMPUTER SCIENCE AM AN ANTHROPOLOGY WRITE SEOR JUST LIKE A BUNCHER TO FRIEND DISCIPLINES AND BUT THAT WAS WHEN I THAW O I CAN AT LEAST SEE IF I CAN GET INTO THIS MAJOR MEVER AS LIKE HE SELECTED MAJ A  SELECTIVE ASI FREAKED OUT OF COURSE AND HAD SUPERIMPOSTORS INTERUM IS LIKE I'VE NOT GOIN TO GET IN TO THE PROGRAMM OF IT THINKFULLY I GOT IN AND I THINK THAT'S YAH THAT'S WHERE I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT LIKE THIS LITTLE SEEDLING OF CURIOSITY TO AM TO THE ACTUAL PURSUIT OF THE THING RIGHT AND AND THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TRANSLATION BECAUSE THERE CAN OFTEN BE A MISMATCH YOU'RE REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING BUT YOUE SHE HATE THE PROCESS RIGHT LIK YOU HATE THE ACTUAL WORK THAT'S INVOLVED AND GETTING BETTER AT IT AN I WAS LUCKY IN MY UNDERGROD BECAUSE I TOUGHT MY WAY MY MOM STYLE BARGING INTO CLASSES THAT LIKE REALLY WOULD ONLY ACCEPTINO SENIORS OUR URGENIORS THAT I WAS LIKE IVE REFRESH LOWLY FRESHMEN LIKE ACCEPT ME A AND I WAS ABLE TO RUN EXPERIMENTS ON ADULSAN I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD DE LIKE TO BE A RESEARCHER TO ASK NOVEL QUESTIONS AND TO GET THE DELIGHT THAT YUTHAT YOU FEEL RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE IN A LAD IND YOU'R ACTUALLY TESTING OUT NEW HYPOTHESES AND SO IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I SAW THAT I NOT ONLY WAS EXCITED BUT THAT I COULD ACTUALLY ENJOY PARTS OF THE PROCESS OF GETTING BETTER I LOVE YOUR DESCRIPTION OF CURIOSITY BECAUSE IT MAKES ME THINK THAT IN SOME WAY HAS SOMETHING O DO WITH A DEEP MOTIVATION AND DESIRE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S AN EXTRA WHAT'S AROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO THE OUTCOME THE CURIOSITY IS REALY JUST TRYNE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THERE I SUPPOSE TO HOPING THAT SOMETHING SPECIFIC IS THERE AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE SURPRISES OR MORE ECITING THAN OUR PREDICTIONS AM TI THINK THE QUO WAS AN ASALLY FROM DOROTHY PARKER I THINK THIS IS DEBATED BY THING IT WAS EM OH I THE CURE FR BORDOM IS CURIOS CITY THERE IS NO CURE FOR CURIOSITY O I THTHIN O YOU  HADN'T HEARD THAT I BELIEVE IT WAS DORNG  HARKER IM SOMETIMES MISATTRIBUTED TO A AGATHETRISTY BUT THING IS DOROTHY PARKER AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CURIOSITY THAT WHEN IT'S GENUINE IT'S SELF AMPLIFYING IT'S AN UPWARD SPIRAL BECAUSE IT THERE IS NO ENDPOINT RIHTOM THAT'S ONE OF THAT THAT THAT THE THINGS THAT YOU LEARN EARLY IN SCIENCES YOU KNOW MU LEARN YOU TUST HYPOTHESES YOU GET ANSWERS AND YOU GET MORE QUESTIONS AN FOR HYPOTHESES AND YOU DO THAT TILL YOU DIE BANS I C AND THAT CAN BE A LITTLE BUT DARK BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS A JOURNEY THAT AT IT'S JUST SO MUCH FUN ALONG THE WAY IF YOUR JUST REALLY INTEREST IN KNOWING WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE WITHOUT GETTING TO ATTACH TO THE ANSWERS IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT TO EVEN AS I'M DESCRIBING NOW THAT JUST CAN JUST FILL FILL YOU UP AND IT PROVIDES MORE ENERGY FOR THE NEXT ROUND AN THE NAXED ROUND AND THAT REALLY CAME THROUGH IN YOUR DESCRIPTION OF OF COGNE SCIENCE I ALSO FIND IT INTERESTING THAT YOU COULDN'T READ SHEET MUSIC AT LEAST NOT VERY WELL YOU WERE SO DEEPLY IM IMMERSED IN AN ENDEAVOUR VIOLIN PLAYING THAT IS NOT OF VERBAL LANGUAGE AND THEN YOU WENT INTO A FIELD THAT'S ABOUT IN LAN ORINITIALLY YOURE YOU WERE SPARKED AN INTEREST IN A FIELD THROUGH AN UNDERSTANDING A VERBAL LANGUAGE AND EARLIER YOU SAID THAT THAT THE THING THAT BRIDGE IS THE VIOLIN AN THIS WHAT CAME NEXT AS AS A PASSION IN PURSUIT WAS THIS DESIRE FOR HUMAN CONNECTION AT WHAT POINT DID YOU REALIZE THAT AND AND HERE I JUST I DO WANT O EMPHASIZE THAT ET WERE TALKING OUT YOUR STORY I HOPE I I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE ARE STRYING TO THINK ABOUT YOU WHAT AR THAT THE INTRINSIC POINTS OF MOTIVATION FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE YOU KNOW ASKING THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT I I HOPE EVERYONE IS ASKING YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS IT REALLY THAT MOTIV ITS ME TO LOVE THIS AND TO SEE A PLACE FOR MYSELF IN THAT IM S THOSE ARE ULTIMLATING THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT E VERYONE SHOULD AND CAN ASK YE I AM IT TOOK ME A REALLY LONG TIME ITS ACTUALLY ONLY BEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT I'VE DISCOVERED THIS AH I DISCOVERED THIS AS A RESULT OF CREATING A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLAN SO I AM MY DESIRE TO CREATE THE SHOW UM CAME FROM A VERY PERSONAL PLACE WHICH IS THAT I'M TERRIFIED OF CHANGE SO EVEN THOUH I'VE HAD THESE FORMITIVE EXPERIENCES WOULD CHANGE I'M A CREATURE OF HABIT AM I'M WILLING TO CHANGE MY HABITS FOR EXAMPLE I NOW TAKE HAFEN NINETY MINUTES AFTER I GET UP HOWS E WORTI FORY VERY WELL AND  TO DAY I HAVEINEVENT DELIHTFUL A WELL THERE SHOULD I LIKE TOTING  I LIKE TO THINK THE PEOPLE FOR THEMSELVES SOMEFLEXIBILITY IF YOU HAD A RUN IDEAR OF WHEN A NITA SIXTY A NIDEAR THE OCCASIONAL  OU A YOU KNOW WITHIN THIRTY MEN IF YE IF YOU HAVE TO BUT NOBODY'S PERFECT NOW NOR SHOULD MY SIMENCS YOUDENTS IM WILLIY NO THING MHEY HAVE  FT I'M A CREATURE OF HABIR AND I THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS WHY WE IS HUMANS AM ARE SCARED OF CHANGE AND I THINK ONE OF THEM WHICH IS INCREDIBLY RELATABLE IS THAT U'M CHANGES FILLED WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND WE HATE UNCERTAINTY WE WILL GO TO IRRATIONAL LENKHS TO AVOID UNCERTAINTY SO ONE MY FAVORITE STUDIES COMING OUT OF A COGNI SCIENCES IS ONE INVOLVING ELECTRIC SHOCKS AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE ARE FAR MORE STRESSED WHEN THEY'RE TOLD THEY HAVE A FIFTY PER CENT CHANCE OF GETTING AN ELECTRIC SHOCK THAN WHEN THEY'RE TOLD THEY HAVE A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CHANCE OF GETTING AN ELECTRIC SHOCK SO WE WOULD RATHER BE SURE CERTAIN THAT A BAD THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN THAN TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANY FEELINGS OF UNCERTAINTY AND AMFIGUITY I I SAT RESULT II I LOVELY BROUGHT OF THEIR RESULT IT'S STILL IS BEWILDERING TO ME  NOWN YOU THINK ABOUT IT A HUNDRED PER CENT TRIAL TO TRIAL SHOCK YOUD MEAN SO JUST YOU HAVE TO TAKE ON THE C BRING IT JUST JUST BRING IT ON CANIMENTALITY BUT IF YOU DID THAT FOR EVERY TRIAL N THEN HALF OF THE TRIALS YOU DON'T GET SHOCKE O 'D GET THE THE WE KNOW THERE'S A DOBLEMEN RELEASE FROM THE LACK OF PUNISHMENT AM SO THE STRATED THE IDEAL STRAGI IS THE SAME AND YET SOMEHOW PEOPLE ARE OVERSE TO THE UNCERTAINTYA WE JUST WE DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY EVEN THOUGH AGAIN THE UNCERTAINTY IS WHAT DRIVES THAT DOB MEAN FIRST WRIHT AND AND YET WWE BRISTLE CERTAINLY M AT AT THAT AT THAT UNCERTAINTY AND SO I I DEFINITELY AND LIKE A PLEASE SATISQO EVERYONE WE LOVE THE SATIS CO EVEN WHEN THE STATUST GUO HAS BEEN SUBOTIMA ANDREW IV BEEN FINE WITH THE STATUST CLOTE SO PART OF IT CAME FROM MY DESIRE TO FIGURE OUT OWAT HOW IS IT LIKE A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANTS RIGHT IN MARRIS SCIENCE AND STORY TELLING TO HELP US FIGURE OUT STRATEGIES FOR BETTER MANAGING CHANGE SO I WANTED TO FIGURE OUT HOW ARE PEOPLE COMING TO TERMS WITH UNCERTAINTY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALIZED AM I LEARN FROM I A THE GUESS WHEM MI SHOWIN ALSO THE SCIENTISTS WHERE'S THIS CONCEPT CALLED COGNITVE CLOSURE AND IT IS THE NEED TO ARRIVE AT CLEAR DEFINITIVE ANSWERS TO THINKS E IT SPACILY OPPOSITE OF THIS OPEN ENDED CURIOSITY THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE WHICH'IS THE COGNIT OF CLOSURE YOU HAVE A NED TO YOU YOU AREN'T INDIFFERENT TO WORDS WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE YOU AREN'T INDIFFERENT TOWARDS WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE YOU CARE ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT MICRO MANAGING EVERY PART OF THE CURIOUS PROCESS FROM POINTATI POINT THE AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT WHEN WE REDUCE OURE NEED FOR COGNITIVE CLOSURE RIGHT WHEN WE WECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE OPEN TO THE UNBIDDEN RIGHT LIKE TO MYSTERY AM MORE OPEN TO ALL IN SPIRING EXPERIENCES WE CAN EXPERIENCE HUGE BOOSE IN WELL BEING AH AND WE CAN BECOME A LOT MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF CHANGE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M WORKING ON WHICH IS LIKE OKAY MAYBE I CAN REDUCE MY NEED FOR FOR COGNITIVE CLOSURE AND THE OTHER THING AM THAT I AM STARTING TO APPRECIATE IS ONE REASON THAT WE WE KIND OF WE GET CHANGE WRONG AND WE MAY BE FEARIT MORE THAN WE SHOULD IS THAT WHEN WE ANTICIPATE WHAT A CHANGE WILL BE LIKE IN THE FUTURE WE TEND TO IMAGINE HOW OUR PRESENT DAY SELLS WILL RESPOND TO THAT FUTURE CHANGE WRITE SO SO MUST LIDE A MAGIC MERITS MAYA AND PRESENT DAY GOING THROUGH THIS MERROR COMES OT THE OTHER SIDE TWO YEARS FOR NOW SHEIS THE ONE WHO'S OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES OF A DIAGNOSIS OR SOME OTHER LIFE CHANGED AND WHAT WE FORGET IS THAT THE BIG CHANGES IN OUR LIVES CAN CHANGE US IN PRETTY PROFOUND WAYS RIGHT AND WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AND AND WE ALL FALL PREY TO THE SOLUTION SO'S CALL THE END OF HISTORY ILLUSION SO THIS IS WORKD BY DAN GILBERT AND BASELY WHAT IT SAYS IS WE FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE CHANGED CONSIDERABLY IN THE PAST SO YOU THINK BACK TO YOUR SCAPE BOAR DAYS RIGHT I THINK BACK TO MY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS AND I THINK O MY GOSH OF COURSE I'VE CHANGED LIKE I WOULD BE ENVARIOUS SOLICIT ANY INTERVIEW I GAVE WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER RIGHT LIKE WHAT WERE THE THOUGHTS I WAS EVEN THINKING SO WE WILL SEE IT ABSOLUTELY WE WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT TEN YEARS AGO TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE AND PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY CONVINCE THAT WHO WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN THIS MOMENT IS THE PERSON THAT'S HERE TO STAY AND THAT CAN LEAD US ASTRAY WHEN IT COMES TO THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WILL RESPOND TO CHANGE BECAUSE WE FORGET THAT THERE'S ACTUALY A LOT OF WIGGLEROOM AROUN WHO WE BECOME AND TO YOUR POINT I MADE I LOVE THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT CURIOSITY WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE WANT TO BE CURIOUS NOT JUST ABOUT THE THINGS WE DO WE WANT TO BE CURIOUS ABOUT OURSELVES ONE HUGE LESSON THAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THE INTERVIEWS THAT 'VE HAD ON A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS IS THAT I NEED TO CONSTANTLY BE AUDITING MYSELF THROUGH MY CHANGE EXPERIENCE TO FIGURE OUT HOW I HAVE CHANGED BECAUSE WHEN WE EXPERIENCE CHANGE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUE RIT SO LET'S SAY I GET A PROMOTION OR I ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP OR I LEAVE A RELATIONSHIP OR SOME OTHER AGAIN NARROW SLICE OF MY LIFE IS ALTERED WE CAN THINK OF THAT CHANGE IS HAPPENING IN EVA CKOU RIGHT AS BEING CONFINED TO JUST THE UNIQUE AREA OF OUR LIFE THAT THAT LITTLE THAT CHANGE EXISTEM BUT OF COURSE WE ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX CREATURES OURE PSYCHOLOGIES AND CREDIBLY COMPLEX WE LIVE IN THESE REMARKABLY COMPLEX EKO SYSTEMS CHANGE IN ONE AREA OF OUR LIFE WILL INEVITABLY HAVE SPILL OVER EFFECTS INTO ALL OTHER PARTS OF OUR LIVES IN WAYS THAT ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND SO YOU KNOW WE I THINK A LOT OF YOUR LISTENERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE RESEARCHOING WORE WERE REALLY BAD COGNATOF FORECASTORS OR IT WE'RE BAD IC PREDICTING WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE US HAPPY WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE US SAD HOW LONG WE'RE GING TO BE SAD HOW LONG WE'RE GOINGTO BE HAPPY WAT ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS THAT WE FORGET THAT WE ARE A DYNAMIC ENTITY THAT MIGHT CHANGE IS WELLH RIGHT THAT OUR PREFERENCES MIGHT CHANGE OUR CHOICE SETS MIGHT CHANGE WE MIGHT CHANGE IN THESE REALLY PROFOUND WAYS THAT WE NOWT REALIZE AND AM I THINK THERE'S AN INSPIRING MESSAGE COMING OUT OF THIS WHICH IS ONE LIKE WHAT WERE CAPABLE OF RIGHT NOW REALLY MIGHT NOT BE WHAT WERE CAPABLE OF LATER AM AND WHAT I'VE FOUND IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ISINTERESTIN WHAT IT COMES TO OUR SELF PERCEPTION BECAUSE WE HAVE A FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE ON WHO WE ARE WE TEND TO THINK THAT WE HAVE A VERY A COMPREHENSIVE LIKE VERIDICAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHO WE ARE RI LOOK I'VE A PRETTY GOOD GRASP OF WHO I MY I AM AND WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF AND WHAT I VALUE N AND WHAT MY IDENTITY IS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THAT UNDERSTANDING IS BASED ON THE RANDOM SET OF DATA POINTS THAT I'VE HAPPENED TO COLLECT OVER THE COURSE OF Y LIFETIME BASED ON THE RANDOM SET OF EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES AND FAILURES AND SUCCESSES THAT I'VE HAPPEN TO HAVE RIGHT AND AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AM THERE'S A SALIENCE TO THE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES OFTEN FOR OE REASONS THAT MAKE SENSE ACCORDING TO NERVOUS SYSTEMS THAT WON'T O KEEP US SAY ET CETERA BUT FRENCS YOU REMEMBER THA TNAME OF THIS CHILD PRONVERYLYLYSURELY MY SISTER STILL TALKS ABOUT I WON'T SAY HER NAMES BECAUSE IT WE KNOW THAT THEE PEOPLE ARE STILL AROUND FORTUNATELY AM THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE THE A GIRLS IN JUNOR HIGH SCHOOL THAT PARTICULARLY POPULAR AND PERHAPS NOT IN LA HALINRHAPS  AIN DA A FOR ARE THEY OTARE THEY NICE TO BE NT S YO FOR NICE THAN A THERE'S A LOT OF WEB SEARCHING NOWADAYS FOR WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE UP TO NOW ANYWAY A THAT NOT BY ANY THIS IS IANHAVE A SISTER WE OCCASIONALLY TOUCHHIM TO THIS AS SHES TO INGRATE FORTUNATELY SO AM THE OTHERS AND THERE'S A SAILINCE TO THE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES BUT BUT I THINK WHAT AM HERING AN I TOLLY AGREE WITH IS THAT AN WE'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETE OR AT LEAST ADEQUATE SELF KNOWLEDGE BUT THAT WE LIKELY DON'T AND AND SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN GET A BETTER DATA ON OURSELVES AN WAYS THAT CAN HELP US IS THAT THROUGH AM THE APPLICATION OF MENTORSHIP IS IT ASKING PEOPLE FOR AN HONEST ASSESSMENT OF US AM WITH OF OF COURSE THE WILLINGNESS TO HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY AM YOUWET WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THE I LOVE ZERO COST BEHAVIORAL BUT AM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ZERO COS BEHAVIORAL SOURCES THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE AROUND THEM IN ORDER TO ASSES WHAT I THINK AR REALLY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS YES IT IS TRUE THERE'S TOO AM INFORMATION A SYMMETRIES LET' SAY THAT WE'E TRYING TO SAL FOR RIGHTS A TWO AREAS WERE WE MIGHT NOT HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF WHO WE ARE FOR ONE OF TWO REASON SO ONE AS THAT A WE HAVE AN INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF WHO WE ARE TOS PACE ON THE RANDOM SET OF EXPERIENCES AND THE SECOND IS THAT GOING THROUGH THIS BIG CHANGE ACTUALLY ALTERS US IN SOME WAY AND PAY SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO SALL FOR THE ATIN THE SECOND PROBLEMS ACTUALLY EASIER TO SALV FOR AND THAT WE OFTEN JUST DON'E EVEN KNO TO LOOK INWHERE T STIRRING IF TIG CHANGE TO SEE HOW WE'VE CHANGED BECAUSE WE THINK OH ALL JUST PAY ATTENTION TO HOW I'M PERFORMING AT WORK IS THAT WAS THE NEW VARIABLE THAT WAS THROWN INTO MY LIFE AND WE FORGET TO EVALUEATE OTHER PARTS OF OUR LIVES LIKE WHAT INPACT HAS AS HOWT O MY RELATIONSHIP WHAT IN PACTISAS HAD ON MY OVER ALL WELL BEING RIGHT AND MY DIFFERENT DO I'VE A DIFFERENT SET OF PREFERENCES DO I CARE ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS SO IN THE SECOND CATEGORY BECOME VERY INQUISITIVE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE OVER A LONGER TIME FRAM AND ASSUME THAT IT'S NOT A STATIC STATE WHEN IT COMES TO THE FIRST A BUCKET WHICH IS HOW DO WE DEVELOP A MORE COMPLETE AND RICH ON RICH ER UNDERSTANDING OFSELF I'M I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT SURROUNDING YOURSELF WITH A DIVERSE SET OF PEOPLE PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T NATURALLY GRAVITATE TOWORDS I THINK THE SOLVES FOR A BUNCH OF SOCIAL ILLS WHICH IS THAT AGAIN WE TEND TO LIVE IN OUR SYLOS RIGHT AND WERE REALLY AVERSE TO TALKING O PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW BUT I WILL TELL YOU AT TIMES I'VE LEARNED THE MOST ABOUT MYSELF I'VE LEARNED THE MOST ABOUT MY WEAKNESSES AND SOMETIMES MY STRENGTHS FROM TALKING WITH SOMEONE THAT I VEHAMENTLY DISAGREE WITH AND IT'S A REALLY HARD THING TO DOU IT'S VERY PAINFUL BUT IN TERMS OF LIKE AND DEFYING EXPERIENCES GO IT'S THROUGH THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT I ALMOST SEE THIS LIKE MERE REFLECTED BACK ON ME RIGHT LIKE WELL I'M MUCH MORE AWARE OF HOW I'M COMING ACROSS TO THAT PERSON CAUSE THEY DISAGREE WITH ME ABOUT SOMETHING OR THEY'RE NOT SOMEWHAT I WOULD NORMALLY FRATENIZED WITH AND IM IT'S JUST BREAD MORE SELF AWARENESS IN ME AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY SEEK OUT CONNECTIONS IN UNCOMFORTABLE SPACES BECAUSE A THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO FILL IN AT LEAST SOME OF THE GAPS NOW SOME OF THE GAPS WILL TRULY ONLY BE REVEALED TO YOU BECAUSE OF LIFE EXPERIENCES SO I'M THINKING IN MY OWN LIFE SO I I THOUGHT I GRIEVED IN A VERY PARTICULAR KIND OF WAY AND THEN DURING COVED MY HUSBAND AND I EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE PREGNANCY LOSSES WITH OUR SIRGIT IM AND I FOUND MYSELF GRIEVING IN A WAY THAT WAS COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO ME I DON'T THINK TALKING ANYONE WOULD HAVE REVEALED TO ME THATI WAS AGRIEVE IN THIS VERY IN THIS WAY WER AND USUALLY I WOULD REACH OUT TO PEOPLE THAN I WOULD WANT TO STAY CONNECT AND I BECAME SO SHUT OFF AND CLOSHES OFF AN I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO ANY ONE FOR DAYS AFTER THE LOSSES I WAS SO DISORIENTED THERE I LEARNED OH ACTUALLY IM YOU CAN RESPONDED TO DIVERSE SET OF WAYS TO GREE RIGHT LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE A SIN GULAR EXPERIENCE WITH GRIEF BUT I MIGHT AVE ONLY LEARNED THAT FROM THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF CONFRONTING IT THAT SAID I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE IN TRYING TO FILL IN GAPS AND KNOWLEDGE OR A SELF AWARENESS THROUGH THESE MORE IU OW QUITIDIAN CONVERSATIONS YOU HAVE WITH PEOPLE I LOVE LOVE LOVE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT DELIBERATELY PLACING ONESELF INTO ENVIRONMENTS WHERE WE RECEIVE CRIDICAL FEED BACK FROM PEOPLE THAT WE VIEW IS QUITE DISPERATE FROM US AT WEASTANT TERMS OF OUR EXPERIENCE OF THEM YOU KNOW IT'SBRT IT WAS THE GREAT CALL DICER OFF ANOTHER A INCREDIBLY CCOMPLISHING OUR SCIENTIST AM HAPPEN TO BE CCALL YOU MON IT IT A STAMFORD WHO IS SECHITRISAND HE SAID YOU KNOW WE THINK WE KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL BUT WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL UNLESS WE ASKED THEM IN FACT MOST IST I'MWILLINY AND REALLY KNOW HOW WE FEEL  WERE NOT VERY GOOD ENGAGING OUR OWN EMOTION SO CREDIT TO QUARREL FOR MAKING THAT STATEMENT BUT WITD THAT SAID I THINK GETTING A SENSE OF HOW OTHER PEOPLE SEE US AND DISAGREEMENT IN PARTICULAR AM CAN BE INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE I JUST N MA SAY ONE OTHER POINT ON THIS WHICH AS I THINK GETTING FEE BACK FROM OTHERS ALMUST GET TO BAD RAUT THESE DAYS IN SOCIETY BECAUSE IT'S LIKE YOU SHOULD ONLY CARE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE INSIDE WHO  KNOW YOURSELF TO BE AND I'N LIKE DUED WE ARE SOCIAL CREATURES AND ABSOLUTELY MATTERS HOW I COME OFF TO OTHERS I I THINK AT SHOULD BE A HUE I HUGE PART OF MY SELF IDENTITY SHOULD BE HOW I INTACT OTHERS AND I I I THINK WE SHOULD BE SHAMELESS ABOUT INTEGRATING THAT INTO OUR UNDERSTANDING OFSELF IF I FEEL LIKE I'M AN EXCELLENT PERSON INSIDE AND I'M REGULARLY WOUNDING THE PEOPLE AROUND ME THAT MATTERS THAT'S RELEVANT TH HOW I SEE MYSELF AND SO I DO WORRY SOMETIMES AT THE CURRENT THE CURRENT CULTURAL CLIMATE THAT WE'RE PUSHING OURSELFES SO MUCH TOWARDS THE SPACE OF LIFE ALL THAT MATTERS IS AUTHENTICITY IN BEING YOURSELF FIRST FELF SOMETIMES YOURSELF ISN'T OUSOM YOU MIGHT WONT ACTUALLY OPTIMIZE LIKE CHANGE ON BIDTINGS ABOUT YOURSELF TO BE BETTER I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING AND THEN SECOND YOU YOU IT'S A KATY CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK USUALLY THEIR GREAT BAROMETER A THING THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE AWARE AT IN CEMT TE ENTACTOR HATING THE ITS NOTE ALIKE BE A LOBVIEST FOR CARRYING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK TO FOR A MOMENT I AGREE OF THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SAY THE END OF EVERY EPISODE THAT I DO READ ALL THE COMMENTS ON YOU TOO UM YOU MIG THINK I WAS RAISED IN AN CULTURE AN ACADEMIC CULTURE WHERE FEED BACK ON LECTURES YOUR STUDENT FEED BACK WAS CRITICAL I MEAN IT IS IMPORTANT I BELIEVE TO BE A SELECTIVE FILTER BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW WHEN IN THE OLD DAYS WILL SAY THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAP THE STATEMENTS TO THE GRADE THAT THE STUDENT RECEIVED YOU CAN NO LONGER DO THIS SO YOU WOULD OFTEN SEE THAT SOME THERE WORSE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE WORSE I I FEED BACK WE HA A REMEN FIRE EXACTLY AND THEN YOUD LOOK AT THEIR GRADE AND YOU SAY WHILE  OKA THIS HELP US EXPLAIN AND YET UM IT WAS ALSO IMPORTANT T UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT COULD HAVE REPRESENTED SOME FAILINGS ON MY PART YE UM AN A CLASSROM IS BUT ONE ENVIRONMENT I THINK THE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT IS WHERE THIS GETS TRICKY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT UM WE ALL DIFFER IN OUR CAPACITY TO RECEIVE CRITICAL FEED BACK AND SOMETIMES THAT THE HARSHNESS OF ONE FORM OF FEED BACK SENDS PEOPLE YOU KNOW OF FEELING YOU KNO BACK ON THEIR HEELS ERE FEELING YOU KNOW EVEN EGO OR EMOTIONALLY INJURED IN WAYS THAT THEY ASHALL FEELS THE TRAMATIC AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A UM  A AWAY TO GAUGE AWE KNOW IN APPROPRIATE WHEN WE SEE IT WE KNOW APPROPRIATE WHEN WE SEE IT BUT ALL THE STUFFING BETWEEN CAUSE ITS ON A CONTINUE UM REALLY IS UM IS WHERE IT GETS TRICKY I I CERTAINLY THINK INDEGRATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT BE RIGHT WHAT IS IT THAT THEY THEY SAY IN UM CERTAIN FORMS OF PERSONAL DEVELEMENTS LIKE YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY'S COMING AT YOU WITH AN ARGUMENT ABOUT YOU THE BEST STATE OF MINE YOU COULD HAVE AS YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT BECAUSE THAT LETS YOU HOLD YOUR GROUND A BIT IT'S IT STILL MAINTAINS ABOUNDARY BUT YOU'RE NOT SAYING YOU'RE RIGHT AND YOU'RE NOT SAYING YOU'RE WRONG YET YOUR SER ON YOUR IN I IN A KIND OF A FLAT FOOTED STANCE WHERE YOU COULD MOVE EITHER WAY AND I LIKE THAT THIS IDEA WLE THEY MIGHT BE RIGHT AND THEN YOU CAN SAY NOW WHY YOUR YES BUT IN ANY CASE I I JUST WANT TO THROW OUT BOTH HANDS IN IN EM AND AS MANY VOTAS I ICAN AS ONE INDIVIDUAL TO SAY YES I TOTALLY AGREE MORE UM MORE DIRECT FEED BACK AND DISAGREEMENT IS GREAT YE'S WONDERFUL AND I THINK IN SCIENCE YOUR USED TO PEOPLE SAYING UM HARSH THINGS ABOUT YOUR WORK UNTILL THEY EVENTUALO SAY  DAY CAN'T OLISH YER OR THAT I GRT UP IN THE CULTURE OF SCAVE WORDING WORE LIKE NOTHINGS GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN OCCASIONALLY SOMETHING'S GOOD UM AND IN THE LANDSCAPE OF PODCASTING UM I THINK THE COMMON SECTION IS IS A GREAT WAY TO I GET FEE BACK THATS WHY I CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE FEE BACK SONCE LIKE YOU DO US WHYA I THINK YOU KNOW I I TRI TO JUST EVERY ENDEAVOR THAT I PURSUE I TRY TO APPROACH WITH A LOT OF HUMILITY AND I THINK IF I WERE TO DESCRIBE YOU NO'T AT WORK RIGHT I I LEAD THIS TEAM AND I I THINK IF YOU WERE TO ASK PEOPLE UM WHAT MY DEFINING TRADE IS AS A LEADER IT' AC SHL NOT LIKE STRONG CONVICTIONS IT'S ACTUALLY A WILLINGNESS TO UP DATE HER OPINIONS ON THINGS HER VELIST SYSTEMS HER STRATEGY BASED ON IN COMING INFORMATION I REALLY REALLY PRIDE MYSELF ON HAVING A FLEXIBLE MIND SET ABOUT STUFF AND NOT BEING STUBBORN THIS IS TRUE IN MY MARRIAGE RIGHT LIKE MY HUSBAND JIMMY AND I REALLY PRIDE OURSELVES IN LIKE YOU KNOW SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SOMEWHAT YOU JUST SHARED I'M CHANGING MY MIND LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT AND I'M WRONG RIGHT AND IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY START TO VALUE THAT IF YOU COULD SARD TO SEE THAT IS TA A VIRTUOUS QUALITY UM I THINK HISTORICALLY RIGHT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LEADERSHIP WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVING ARE INCREDIBLY RESOLUTE IN THEIR CONVICTIONS BUT THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THE SPACE TO AGAIN BASION UP DAY  YOU KNOW OF DATE YOUR MINDS THAT WHEN YOU GET NEW INFORMATION OR YOU REALIZE THAT YOU ERRED IN SOME WAY AND TURMS THE LOGIC THAT YOU USED OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND I'V BEAN EXTREMELY INTENTIONAL IN EVERY SPHERE THAT I WORKED END TO HAVE THIS VERY OPEN MINDED TO BE VERY OPEN TO CRITICAL FEE BACK IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I TAKE EVERY PIECE OF FEE BACK A PAY OBVIOUSLY I HAVE SOME CRITERA USE TO DECIDE WHETHER IT'S MEANINGFUL FEE BACK OR IS NOT MEANING FULFE BACK RIGHT BUT THE LOCUST OF MY PRIDE IS NOT IN HAVE IT BEING WRIT OR HAVING THE STRONG CONVICTION IT IS ACTUALLY IN MY WILLINGNESS TO HAVE A A MORE DYNAMIC STATE OF MINE REGARDING LAWS OFDISHIES MAYBE THAT MAYBE THAT'S JUST WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SCIENTISTS RIGHT LIK YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO UPDATE IN THE FACE OF NEW INFORMATION I AM NODDING FOR THOSE ARE LISTENING I'M JUST NODDING AND THINKING YES YES AND AND MORE YES BECAUSE I THINK THAT UM WE ALL NEED MORE OF THAT AS INDIVIDUALS AND IF WE CAN'T GET IT FROM OUR WORK SETTING YOUR GROUP SETTING SOMETIMES ASKING A FRIEND CAN BE EXTREMELY USIE A FRIEND HE HAPPENS TO BE A PROFESSOR HE UNIVERSY BACKEAST I WON'T EMBARRASS HIM BY WHY A DISCLOSING WHERE HE'S AT BUT I RECALL AS A A JUNIOR FACLTY MEMBER BECAUSE HE KNOWS ME WELL HIS FE YEARS BEHIND ME IN OUR CREARTORY JECTORIES BUT ASKING HIM FOR AN HONEST ASSASSMEN I ASKED FOR THE MOST BRUTALLY HONEST ASSASSMENT ME THAT HE COULD GIVE AND SOME OF IT STONG SOME OF IT DONG HE WAS O AE RELATING SOME WAYS IN WHICH I SHOW UP AS A FRIEND IND A SUPERPRESENT THAN I HAVE TIS TENCY UM PRETTY INTERVERTED ALL DISAPPEAR FOR LONG PERIDES OF TIME IN COLLEGE THEY CALL BE DARK CAUS I SHOW IT PARTIES I BE THEN THAN I DISAPFLECT TWO WEEKS AND ISAPPE IN MY BOOKS SAY HOW TO PEOPLE JUST KEEP GOING NA SERVE IN AND OUT OF CONNECTION I I'VE WORKED HARD TO TO CHANGE THAT OVER THE YEARS IT UM I THINK I HAVE BUT WHO KNOWS IM IN ANY EVENT A A FRIEND WHO KNOWS US WELL THAT YOU INSIST ON I DON'T GIVE ANY COMPLIMENTS HE KNOW JUST GIVE ME THE HARSH STUFF I THAT CAN BE VERY USEFUL IT NEVEREMINDS ME SOME RESEARCH AN BY EATHEN CROSS IF HE LOOKS THAT HOW WE CAN TAME OUR MENTAL CHATTER AND AM IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE FRIEND AVAILABLE TO YOU THERE IS A REALLY EASY DISTANCIN TECHNIQUE THAT YOU AN YOUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE THROES OF OUR PROBLEM YOU ARE TRYING TO ACTIVELY REREFRAME SOMETHING OR MAYBE SEE WHERE YOUR BLIND SPOTS ARE AND THAT'S BY THINKING ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM FROM A THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE VERSES OF FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE SO YOU PLAY THE ROLE OF SOME ONE WHO'S GIVING ADVICE TO A FRIEND IN YOUR HEAD BUT THAT FRIEND IS ACTUALLY YOU AND IT ACTUALLY PROMOTE SOME DEGREE OF OBJECTIVITY AND LIKE EMOTIONAL DISTANCE FROUM AGAIN THAT TAT FUZZY HAZY SET OF FEELINGS THAT YOU HAVE AROUND THE EMOTION WAT YOUR TRIN LIKE GET RID OF THAT PEACE SO THAT YOU CAN BRING UM A SLIGHTLY MORE SOBER  RECOMMENDATION OF THE SITUATIONS O THAT CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL AND THEN OM THE OTHER THING TO DO IS I THINK WHEN WE ARE WHEN WE'RE FACING CHALLENGE IS WE WE'RE GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME WE DO HAVE AN INSTINCT TO WANT TO VENT RIGHT IN AGAIN IN THIS AIR OF ULNOBILITY AND WHAT NOT WE'RE TOLD LIKE YES SHARE EVERYTHING THAT'S ON YOUR MIND IT CAN ACTUALLY BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO VENT AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE VENTING ABOUT A HARD SITUATION THAT YOURE GOING THROUGH OR SOMETHING HAT YOUR FRUSTRATED ABOUT WITH YOURSELF UM TYPICALLY THE PERSON YOU'VE INVITED INTO THE CONVERSATION THEY'RE A NICE EMPATHETIC PERSON THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER AND SO WHAT WHAT DO THEY DO THEY OFFER EMOTIONAL BALM IN THE SITUATION  OH MY GOD THAT DOES SOUND TERRIBLE YOU WERE SO WRONGED I'M SO SORRY YOU WENT THROUGH THAT INSTEAD OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF WHAT YOTHEN CALLS LIKE A COGNITIVE ADVISER WHICH IS ACTIVELY TRYING TO CHALLENGE THE NARRATIVE YOU'R TELLING ABOUT YOUR SITUATION ACTIVELY TRYING TO GET YOU TO UM QUESTION WHETHER THE WAY YOU'RE FORTRAYING THE SITUATION IS ACCURATE AND ACTUAVELY TRYING TO GET YOU TO REFRAME ASPECTS OF THE SITUATION AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT VENTING WHEN IT COMES TOGAIN FEELING IN THOSE BLIND SPOTS ABOUT OURSELVES YOU YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL YOUR FRIEND AT THE OUTSET LIKE YOUR YOU EVEN SAID LAY OFF THE YOU'RE THE NICE STUFF I JUST WANT TO HEAR THE HARD STUFF YOU WANT YOU WANT TO TELL YOUR FRIEND AT THE BEGINNING LOOK AND HAVING THIS CHALLENGE WITH MY CHOLIGUE AT WORK FOR THE SKY THE GIMS GAVE ME A REALLY TOUGH TIME AND AN ALWHAT'S GOING ON I MEAN TO HAVE HERE HERE'S THE SEREUS OF SITUATION RATHER THAN TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE SITUATION I WANT YOU TO ACTIVELY FIND HOLES POKE HOLES IN THE WAY THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS THING S THAT I CAN TRY AND FIND SOME REFRAMING STRATEGIES TO SEE THE SITUATION FROM A DIFFERENT VANTAGE PLOIN SO THESE ARE ALL CALLED DISTANCING TACTINGS FOR T THIRD PERSON PERSONS PERST PERSON AND ACTUALLY THRE SOME REALLY INTERESTING NAUROW SCIENCE A RESEARCH SHOWING THAT WHEN WE YOU OUR PROBLEMS THAN OURE OURSELVES FROM A THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE O YOURE AL ACTIVITY IN AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH HOSTILITY AND A GRASSION ACTUALLY DECREASE AH INSTAID I CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW RESOLVING INTERPERSONAL CONFLACT OR TRYING TO SEE WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG I LOVE THESE EXAMPLES BECAUSE ESPECIALLY THE ONE WERE ONE DOESNIT ON THEIR OWN IT TRULY DOESN'T REQUIRE ANYTHING A SON DONT DY INTERVERTED ANTERTO NOT EVNIS YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO THE PARTY AND O EVERYONE YNE I DON'T I GOT BACK THEN IT WOUD HAVE BEEN THERE WERE NO SELF ONSPUT A OR SMART FONS RATHER BUT YE WAS A BIT OF GHOSTING AI WAS JUST I MIGHT MY I CAN RESET WITH SMALL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT IM CLOSE TO BUT UM YOU KNOW I I FOUND AT THAT TIME I NEED TO TO GO INTO AN ISOLATED SPACE TO DO WHAT I NEED TO DO TO RESET MYSELF EM BUT I REALIZE THERE CERTAIN FORMS OF COMMUNICATION THER STILL REQUIRED WHY 'M ALIVE YE I STILL GET THAT I STILL GAT THIS FOR MY MOTHER AT ONCE MORE LOOK YOU KNOW IF IF YOU DON'T REACH OUT NOT ONLY DO I NOT KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU BUT I ALSO DON'T KNOW IF YOUR OQET SOMETHING I'M A GROWN MAN OF COURSE I ONT NONT AND I AND THAT I OF COURSE USE THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSE AT ANY SON OR CHILD COULD GIVE WHICH S LESTEN' IT IS ONLY HAPPENTO ME LIKE SOME ONE LIKE THE POLICE WOULD CONTACT YOU ORE LI NOW THAT THE HOSPITAL CONJECT WHICH IS NOT REASSURING SO KIDS EVERYWHERE CALL YOU TER OR FATHER ANDE I KNOW I KNOWSON COLLAR AT VAN AN I N V STILL WORKING ON IT  UM IT IS A WORK IN PROGUSS HUM VENTING IT I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS UP YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE THESE BUZZ WORDS NOW IN AUTHENTICITY UM YOU KNOW I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN FORMS OF COMMUNICATION THAT THAT CAN BE A INJURIOUS TO PEOPLE AND YET I THINK HAVING SOME INTERNAL BUFFERS TO TO THAT ALL THAT IN COMING STUFF I MEE IS IMPORTANT AND YOU CAN'T BEYOND LINE AND I THINK EVERYONE IS PRETTY MUCH ARNALYING THESE DAYS AM WITHOUT HAVING SOME POLICIES FOR ONESELF AND HOW YOU GAN A DEAL WITH THE STUFF HOW AM I GING TO BE A SELECTIVE FILTER II THINK KNOWING THE ENDS OF THE CONTINUAL LIKE YOU KNOW THIS IS CLEARLY AM BENEVOLENT KIND DISCOURSE THIS IS CLEARLY BAD AMEN A BLOCK THIS ORE GET RIDOF IT BUT THEN WITHIN THAT MIDDLE RANGE HAVING SOME RULES AND POLICIES FOR HAW TO FILTER IT A NEITHER BY TIME OF DAY THAT YOU LOOK AT IT OR GETTING IN PUT A BUT CONSIDERING THE YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE TRUE IT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE A WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW YOU WERE TALKING THAT MEMORY AND HOW WE TEND TO OVERWEIGHT NEGATIVE A EXPERIENCES AND I DIDFIND MYSELF LIKE A SI GIV THE SPEECH IN OF HIS POSTED AND I I I WAS LOOKING AT THE COMMENTS AND I LITERALLY LIKE ANY TIME MY BRAIN COATED A COMMONIST POSITIVE A JUST GIPPED RIGHT PASTIT  WAS I WAS LITERALLY JUST SEARCHING FOR THE NEGATIVE STUFF AS AS IF IT AS IF THE POSIT HIS GENERIC AND THE NEGATIVE AS IS SOMEHOW GENUINE YES WEN I HAD TO MAKE IT A MENTAL I TO MAKE A MENTAL NOTE HEY IT'SO CATE AN MARINY IN THE THE THE MESSAGES THAT ARE SAYING THAT I REALLY HELPED THEM IN SOME WAY AND THEY ARE REANLY ENJOY AT THE THING AND THET YOU WULD AGAIN FOR SELF CRITICAL PEOPLE I THINK IT TAKES AN EXTRA STAP TO REMIND YOURSELF TO ALLSO READ THE GOOD STUFF  AND TO ALLOW THAT STUFF TO COUNT TO WELL WE DIDN'T EPISODE ON GRATITUDE AN ONE OF THE A BIG SURPRISES THAT CAME TO ME IN RESEARCHING FOR THAT EPISODE WAS AT A THE BEST EVIDENCE FOR GRATITUDE HAVING POSIVE EFFECTS ON NARRL CIRCUITRY NOR CHEMISTRY COMES FROM WHEN WE RECEIVE GRATITUDE I SUPPOSED TO GIVE GRATITUDE THIS IS WHAT'S OFTEN LOST IN TI ISCUSHING ABOUT GRATITUDE SO ALL THE MORE INCENTIVE TO GIVE GRATITUDE AND AND TO BE AWARE OF WHEN IT'S COMING YOUR WAY AND INTERNALIZE IT A THERE IS A SMALL CATEGORY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE I THINK HOPEFULLY SMALL THAT IM SO A BASK IN POSITIVE A FEED BACK THAT IT AMPLIFIES THEIR NARCISISM BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU ARE NOT HO ONE OF THE PEOPLE SO YUS ZERO MINEST ONE RISK O OF THAT HAPPENING UM I WANT TO TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT GOALS AS IT RELATES TO MONIVATION U BECAUSE YIU'VE DONE THAT YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF A IMPORTANT A WORK AND AND WHAT I CONCIEDEREIS ORGANIZATION OF THIS  WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A PRETTY COMPLEX SPACEION WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO MOST PEOPLE THAN BEING MOTIVATED AND FOCUSSED AND EXCITED HOPEFULLY ON ON ENDEAVORS THAT THEY ENJOY AND THAT INSPIRE TELIGHT BUT TELL US ABOUT WHAT CANNOT JUST INITIATE BUT WHAT CAN SUSTAIN MONIVATION A BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT THE DOPEMING SYSTEM ON THIS POD CAST MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT THAT'S A PRETTY REDUCTIONIST WAY TO LOOK AT IT AND YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT I I'VE REALLY BENEFITED FROM LEARNING A BIT ABOUT YES SO WHEN IT COMES TO GOALS I MEAN IT'S FIR SOME GORN TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEREIS TWO PARTS OF A GOAL A PASE SO THERE'S THE WAY THAT WE DEFINE THE GOAL AND THEN THERE'S THE WAY THAT WE PURSUE THE GOAL AND I THINK WE TEND TO OVERLOOK THE FIRST CATEGORY HOW WE DEFINE THE GOAL BECAUSE OFTENTIMES OUR GOAL SEEN LIKE THEY SHOULD BE SO OBVIOUS TO US RIGHT I WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT I WANT TO AVOID SLEEPING LATES THAT I GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP I WNT TO BUILD MUSCLE MASS RIGHT LIKE THESE ARE THINGS SUCH A SEEN LIKE THEY SHOULD JUST BE INTUITIVE RIGHT BUT WHAT RESEARCH IN BEHAVRAL SCINE SHOWS AS THAT NOT ALL GOAL FRAMES ARE MADE EQUAL IN FACT REALLY SMALL TWEEKS TO THE WAY THAT WE FRAME OUR GOALS CAN HAVE AN OUTSIZED IMPACT ON WHETHER OR NOT WERE A SUCCESSFUL AT REACHING THECKOAL ON SO ONE SUCH FRAMING IS WHETHER YOU FRAME YOUR GOALS AND TURNS OF AN APPROACH ORIENTATION OR AN AVOIDANCE ORIENTATION SO WE TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS SO N APPROACH ORIENTATION WOULD BE I WANT TO EAT HEALTHIER FOUITS RIGHT AVOIDANCE WOULD BE I WANT TO AVOID UNHEALTHY OCAS SO IN THE CONTECTS WOF SAY YOUR SOCIAL LIFE APPROACH SOULD BE I WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP I WANT TO ENTER A RELATIONSHIP AVOIDANCE WOULD BE I WANT TO AVOID FEELING LONELINESS IF I WANT O VOID FEELING A ISOLATED NOW THE REASON WHY THESE TWO FRAMES ARE IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER IS THAT THEY CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON OUR MOTIVATIONAL STATE AND THEY CAN ALSO HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE THAT WE HAVE TO SUCCESS IN FAILURE IN THESE DOMAINS SO WHAT WE TEND TO FIND IS THAT WHEN YOU FRAME SOMETHING IN AN APPROACH ORIENTATION WAY AM WHEN YOU SUCCEED THAT SUCCESS IS MET WITH FEELINGS OF PRIDE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT WE FIND THAT IT LEADS TO ABOOSTAN MOTIVATION BOOSTS ENDURANCE IT BURST BOOST PERSEVERANCE EH WHEN YOU FRAME SOMETHING IN TERMS OF AVOIDANCE SUCCESS IS MET WITH FEELINGS OF CALM AND RELIEF SO CUN IT LIKE A OH WIFE THE FOREHEAD LIKE THANK GOODNESS I AVOIDED THAT CALAMITOUS OUTCOME OR THANK GOODNESS I AVOID DOING THAT REALLY BAD THING BACT TO NEUTRAL YE EXACTLY AND SO IT IS FINE TO FRAME GOALS AND TERMS OF AVOIDANCE AND ACTUALLY SOMETIMES IS JUST PERSONALITY DEPENDENT LIKE SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE DRIVEN BY FEAR OR THEY NEED A LOT MORE URGENCY TO DRIVE THEM BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE APPROACH ORIENTATION IS ON AVERAGE MORE MOTIVATED AND SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK OF REFRAMING YOUR GOAL IN TERMS OF APPROACH VERSES AVOIDED THE OTHER ADVANTAGE TO APPROACH IS THAT WHEN YOU FRAME SOMETHING IS AVOIDI RIGHT I WANT TO AVOID DOING EX I WANT AVOID DOING WHY IT'S REALLY HARD A MEASURE SUCCESS RIGHT IT'S LIKE ARE YOU REALLY TRACKING EVERY TIME YOURE TEMPTED BY THE CHALCATIVE COOKIE AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY EAT IT THAT'S REALLY HARD A MEASURE RIGHT AND WE DO BETTER WHEN WE CAN MEASURE SUCCESS AND FAILURE RIGHT IT'S MUCH EASIER TO TRACK THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU APPROACH A SALAD RIGHT YOU APPROACH SOMETHING THAT'S HEALTHY AND SO ANYWAY SO IT' IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY GT THIS REALLY SUBTLE SHIFT AND WE SEE THIS ACROSS THIS THE THE BORD AN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE CAN HAVE SUCH A BEING IMPACT ON ON BEHAVIOR AND AM ON THIS FRAMING THING ALL DESHERE ONE LITTLE ANECDOTE FROM MY TIME WORKING IN GOVERNMENT SO WE WERE TRYING A MOD IV ATE VETERANS TO SIGN UP FOR A AM EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMMES SO THIS IS AFTER THEIR YEARS OF SERVICE AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BENEFIT THAT THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS FOR FREE BECAUSE THE TRANSITION FROM MILITARY TO CIVILIAN LIFE CAN BE VERY FRAUT WITH A LOT OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL OBSTAL OBSTACLES AND SO I REMEMBER THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN'S AFFAIRS THEY HAD ALMOST NO MONEY TO TO FUN AN MARKETING PROGRAM AROUND THIS THEY SAID MYA AND TEAM WEVE GOT ONE EMEL THET WERE GEN A SEND TO THETS AND LIKE HAVE AT IT OF THAT'S ALL WE'RE WORKING WITH AND MY TEAMATES AND I ENDED UP CHANGING JUST ONE WORD IN THIS EMAIL MESSAGE INSTEAD OF TELLING THATS THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAMM WE SIMPLY REMINDED THEM THAT THEY HAD EARNED IT THROUGH THEIR YEARS OF SERVICE AND THAT ONE WORD CHANGE LED TO A NINE PER CENT INCREASE AND ACCESS TO THE BENEFIT AND IT'S AM IT'S BASE IN A PSYCHOLOGICAL A PRINCIPLE CALLD THE ENDOWN THENT EFFACT WHICH SAYS TAT WE VALUE THINGS MORE WHEN WE OWN THEM OR IN THIS CCASE HAVE EARNED THEM ANSO I SHARE THIS EXAMPLE ONLY TO SAY LIKE THAT IS SUCH A SMALL CHANGE RIGHT AM BUT WE WE JUST KNOW THAT AGAIN THESE SMALL LITTLE TWEEKS IN THE WAY THAT WE TALK TO OURSELVES AWAY THAT WE FRAME OUR GOALS CAN HAVE A REALLY BIG INFACT ON OUR BEHAVIOR I'M FASCINATED BY THAT RESULT A SOME PEOPLE HEARING IT MIGHT THINK O CIN TIN PERCENT TIS THAT REALLY THAT GREAT BUT I MENT A ONE WORD CHANGE IN E UM AND THE SCALE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WRIGHT ONIN F ATY GRNIZATION HOR HORATO AR TO A ARE YOU THAT HE THINGS A CHANGE QUICKLY IN BIG ORGANIZATIONS A DISCUSSION FOR ANOTHER TIME UM BUT ELITUBLE VERSES EARNED A AGAIN A COME BACK TO THIS POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT WORDS LIKE EARNED THAT INVOKE OVERB STATE WITHIN US THAT MAKES US MORE ACTION ORIENTED UM SIMILAR TO BEING ABLE TO SEE OURSELVES IN SOME LANDSCAPE THAT CAN EVOKE DELIGHT  AW A SUPPOSED TO JUST SEEN THE LANDSCAPE THAT EVOKES DELIGHT OR AWE UM I'M REALLY HUNG UP ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK UM ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES IT SEEMS FOR BEHAVIOR AL CHANGE IS THAT MOST PEOPLE DO WAIT FOR THE THE STICK AS OPPOSED TO FEELING INTO THE CURRATE SO DO SPIAR UM I MEAN ILL YOU HAVE TO DO AS LOOK AT THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HEALTH RELATED UM ISSUES FOR WHICH THERE'S NOW A LOT OF ACTIVE DEBATE IS IT GENETICALLY DETERMINED OR IT SIR AND SETTING ALL THAT ASIDE IT'S JUST VERY CLEAR THAT THEIR NUMBER OF BEHAVIORAL THINGS SOME LIGHT SLEEP EXERCISE SOCIAL CONNECTION NUTRICION U AMONG AMONG THEM THAT THERE'S NO PILL FOR THERE'S NO INJECTION FOR THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REPLACEMENT FOR SO GETTING PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IS HARD YES TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEIR CAPABLE SOMETIMES HELPS BUT DOESN'T SEEM SUFFICIENT SO WHAT WHAT ARE SOME MORE OF THESE A VERB STATES THAT PEOPLE UM YOU THINK CAN INTERNALIZE THAT GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THE REAL SENSE OF POSSIBILITY AND GET THEM CHANGING THEIR BEHAVIOR YET AN BEHAVIOUR CHANGES VERY HARD I SOMETIMES BRISTLE AT SOME OF THE LIKE HACKS THAT I SEE ON LINE THE LIKE DON'T THINKG THIS LOT OF EVIDENCE SET SUPPORTS THAT THIS WORK SO UM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SHARING TO DAY IS ATY BACK BY YOUR REALLY HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH AN ONE O MY FRIENDS AND UM A NANTORIS IELLAT FISHBOLK AS IN A LOT OF THIS WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO ON GOLD SETTING INMODIVATION UM A CA COUPLE OF THESE THINGS FOR PEOPLE TO CONSIDER AND BY THE WAY I LOVE THE SFACES BECAUSE I'M APSTS OF GOLDS RIGHT SO I LOVE GETTING BETTER AT THINGS AT I I'V EEN USING ALL OF THESE INSIGHTS AN MY OWN LIFE SO IT IS TRULY A DELIGHT TO GET TO SHARE SIDEBORE I'M IMPORTANSI WIID ARE YOU YOU MA LIYOU LIT LESE ATA YOU DON'T JUST RESEARCH IT YOU LOYES IT'S IT'S TOTALLY MESEARCH FOR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT IM SO A WHO SETS THE GOALD MATTERS SO A LOT OF US WORK WITH COACHES TRAINERS MENTORS BOSSES THAT'S GREAT IT'S REALLY REALLY HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES TO BRING STRUCTURE TO OUR GOALS TO PUSH US ALONG TO MOTIVATE US BUT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE SETTING OUR GOALS SETTING OUR TARGETS FOR US IT UNDERMINES A REALLY VALUABLE SOURCE OF MOTIVATION WHICH IS BEING IN THE DRIVER SEAT WE LOVE STEERING IN OUR LIVES WE LOVE FEELING AGENCY WE LOVE RECRUTING OUR OWN AGENCY WHEN IT COMES TO ACHIEVING OUR GOALS AND SO N UNO WE TUCKED ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WILL GO TO IRRATIONAL LENGTHS TO AVOID A FEELING UNCERTAINTY PEOPLE ALSO GO TO A RATIONAL LENGTHS TO PRESERVE THEIR AGENCY IN CONTROL OVER AU SITUATION SO THERE'S SOME REALLY INTERESTING RESEARCH THAT'S COME OUT JUST IN THE LAST FOW YEARS SHOWING THAT HUMANS PREFER TO USE THEIR JUDGMENT OVER AN ALGAR THEM THAT THEY KNOW PERFORMS BETTER THAN THEIR JUDGMEN BUT DID NOT INVOLVE THEM OE ANDTHEYRE MUCH MORE SATISFIED WIT THE OUTCOMES WHAT WHEN IT'S THEM THAT'S IN THE DRIVER SEAT RIGHT AND SO UM WHAT THIS MEANS I THINK IN EVERYDAY CONTECT IS NOT TO DO AWAY WITH LIKE TRAINERS AND COACHES AND WHT NOT EVERY TRAINER AN COACH IS LISTENING DON'T HATE ME OHEY YOUR YOU'RE STICKING AROUND BUT WHAT THEY CAN'T DO AS THEY CAN BUILD SOME SOMETHING OF A CHOICE SET INTO YOUR DATEDAY PROGRAMMING RIGHT SO LET'S SAY THAT AT WORK YOU HAVE A CERTAIN SKILL THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD AS FOR SET OF OPTIONS TO THUSE FROM OWN THE TARGETS MORE YOU WILL SEE A BOOSTON MOTIVATION LET'S TAY YA'RE WORKING OUT WIT THE TRAINER THEY'RE LIKE IT'S LEGDAY OE I'MNTO OWN SOME MY TARGETS RIGHT ARE WEGIG TO GO HEAVY CART ON DEAD LIVES ARE WE TO GO AT HART OF SQUATS WHATEVER IT IS AND SO BUILD SOME AGENCY INTO THE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE NOTHING SUPPLANTS THAT KIND OF INTRINSIC DRIVE AN THE FEEL ING THAT YOU OWN THE SICCASS OR THE FAILURE UM THAT AGAIN I I THINK YOUUR EARLIER POINT WILVER REALLY TRYING TO DO WITH SOME OF THESE BEHAVIAL INSIGHTS IS CAPITALIZE IN OUR NATURAL STATE AS UMANS RIGHT LIKE WHAT DRIVES US AND IT TURNS OUT WE REALLY LOVE BHEING IN CONTROL WELLWHY DON'T WE MONOPOLIZE ON THAT WHEN IT COMES TO A OUR GOL FORSY RIGHTS OR TRYIN TO FIGURE OUT THOSE AREAS THE PSYCHOLOGY THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE  FANTASTIC THE WORD AGENCY IS SOKEY HERE I THINK IN IT EXPLAINS THAT EARLIER RESULT THE SHOCK EXPERIMENT PEOPLE HAVING AGENCY OVER ONE HUNDRED THEIRE RESPONSE TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME AT LEAST IT'S IT'S GIVING THEM SOME SENSE OF CONTROL IN MITIGATING IT WEREAS WHEN IF WHEN IT'S AT RANDOM FIFTY FIFTY YE IV OR RATHER WHEN IT'S RANDOM FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TRIALS THAN UM EVEN THOUGH THE OUTCOME IS BETTER ON THE WHOLE IT'S IT'S PERCEIVED SOMEHOW AS A REDUCTION AND AGENCY UM THERE'S SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL THERE FOR SHORT WHEN I STARTED MY LABORATORY IN IT THERE WAS UM IN ADDITIONAL PRESSURE TO PUBLISH PAPERS THIS AS BEFORE GETTING TENURE I USED TO ASK STUDENTS IN POSTOCKS WHEN THE THE PAPER WOULD BE READY AND THEN FINALLY I STOPPED ASKING AN JUST SAID WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHEN THE DEAD LINE N AS YES AND NOT A SINGLE ONE FAILED OR RATHER I SHOULD PUT IT IN THE PASI LIGHT EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY SUCCEEDED IN BEATING THERE ASTIMAT IM BECAUSE THEY WERE IN CONTROL OF THAT IN POINT SO IT WAS AM AT TIMES A CHALLENGING FOR ME YOU KNOW BUT THEY THEY SAT A DATE AND THEN IF AND ALSO BY THE WY THEY NEED TO EXTEND THAT DATE OUTWARD WE DID THAT WAS THEIR CHOICE I SAID THEY NEED MORE TIME E THAT THE RULE IN SCIENCE THAT I THINK APPLIES A LOT OF PLACES I ALWAYS LIKE THE PHRASE UM AS FAST AS I CAREFULLY CAN BECAUSE YOU DONT WANT A RUSH ARIGHTY BU  BUT THAT SENSE OF AGENCY I LIKE TO THINK TRANSLATED TO U MORE A JOY FOR THEM IT CERTAINLY THERE WAS A LOT OF PRODUCTIVITY FROM THEM D THE AND THERE MIGHT BE LISTENING TO THISTEN SO THEY CAN PUT IN THE COMMENTS WHETHER NOT IAM TELLING THE TRUTH RE THERE ALL I MOST OFOFER PROFESSORS NOW WHAT AV WRONG IM YEE HAVE SUCCEEDED UT THEY ALWAYS EXCEEN THE QUESTIONS WHETHER NOT I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT MY ADVISER IS ALWAYS SAID  ON THE BESTHING YOU CAN DO AS SUPPORT YOUR STUDENTS IN POST OXTION AN JUST GET AT THEIR WAY BECAUSE THE REALLY GOOD ONES AR YO CAN'T CONTROL TEM YOU'RE JUST YOU JUST TRYING ON NOT SCREW THINGS OUT FOR TE GIVE NOW THEREIS NOT AN INTENTICMINATION A CURIOUS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LONE PURSUITS AND GROUP PURSUES CAUSE I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT GROUPS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TALK ABOUT AM GROUPS THINK ALTHOUGH THAT HAS SUCH A NEGATIVE CONNETATION BUT THE WAY THAT WE TEND TO A AN OF A REVERT TO THE MEAN WHEN IT COMES TO I WERE THINKING IN OUR OPINIONS AND CERTAINLY ARE AM EXPLANATIONS OF WHOSE RIGHT IN WHS WRONG WHEN WE ARE IN A COLLECTION OF LIKE MINDED PEOPLE YE THIS COULD ALSO BE YOU KNOW PHRAISED AS WONE ARE THE DANGERS OF BEING AMONG LIKE MINDED A AND AND THEN WELL RELATE THAT BACK TO MOTIVATION BUT WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF BEING AMONG LIKE MINDED PEOPLE YE ANMYOU WILL IN THE CONTECT OF GOALS AND MOTIVATION IT CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL TO BE IN THE CONTECTS OF LIKE MINDED PEOPLE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE OFTEN DON'T SEE FAILURE UP CLOSE WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE PURSUING THEIR GOALS BUT IF WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE WHOSE VALUES WE SHARE WHO HAVE A SIMILAR COMMITMENT TO DOING SOMETHING AND WE SEE UP CLOSE THAT THEY SOMETIMES HAVE THOSE DAYS WHERE THEY FAIL OR WE HAVE THE VULNERABILITY TO SHOW WHEN WE FAILED THAT CONNECTALLY INCREASE OUR RESOLVE THAT THE GOALS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE ARE ACTUALLY POSSIBLE E I THINK THE DANGER OF BEING IN THE THE LIKE MINDED FACES IS AROUND HOW LIMITS YOUR YOURE FRAME OF MIND RIGHT SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONVICTIONS YOU HAVE AROUND YOUR POINTS OF VIEW IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS TO ONLY THE IN THE IN THE ECHO CHAMBER AND AGAIN CAUSE I WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE STRATEGIES TO CHALLENGE THE WAY OF THINKING WITHOUT THEM HAVING THE SOCIALIZE FOR ALL THE INTERVERTS OUT THE RE LOT O COMPASSION  I  ID INTERVERT TENDENCIES SO I GET IT ON ONE HELFUL THOUGHT EXPERIMENT YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE MAY BE OUR SPENDING A LITTLE BAT TOO MUCH TIME AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST REENFORCING WHATEVER FEW POINTS YOU HAVE IS TO ASK HOW YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM IN YOUR YOUR IDEAS AND YOUR OPINIONS OF THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD YOU BEEN BORN DURING A DIFFERENT TIME PERIOD AND IN A DIFFERENT FAMILY OR CULTURAL LANDSCAPE AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT COMES TO OUR VIEW POINTS IS THAT THEY BECOME SO TETHERED TO OUR IDENTITIES THAT WE FEEL LIKE IF WE WERE TO JEDICINE A CERTAIN BELIEF OR VALUE WE WOULD BE JEDISINING OURSELFES AND THAT FEELS WAY TOO THREATENING ITS WAY TO DESTABALIZING TO ENGAGE IN THAT BUT THE MINUTE YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT WULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TO  TO HAVE BEEN BORN IN A DIFFERENT FAMILY WITH DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS BELIEF SYSTEM WITH A DIFFERENT VALUE SYSTEM ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU TRANSPORT YOUR SAME SELF RIGHTAM STILLMAYA INTO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT ND YOU START TO SEE HOW NON PRECIOUS SOME OF YOUR BELIEFS ARE RIGHT LEBUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SACRED QUALITY THAT YOU THOUGHT THAT THEY DID AND SO YOU MIGHT BE MORE OPEN TO CHANGING YOUR MIND MORE OPEN AND RECEPTIVE TO CHALLENGING YOUR OWN POINTS OF VIEW IF YOU ENGAGE IN THAT THAT POT EXPERIMENT I RECALL YOU DISCUSSING A DESCRIPTION OF PEOPLE WATCHING A GAME OF SPORT THAT INVOLVE THAD CALLS YEA I CONTROVERSAL REFOR YUON RRSON AFER HE CALLS UM YEF YOU CAN SHARE WITH US O TA ABOUT THAT RESULTAS I WHEN IT REALLY INTERESTING ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE UM THE EXPERIMENTORS CAN SWAP THE IDENTITIES OF THE TEAMS IN INTHEORY AND THEN UM WELL THEY SICALLY WHAT PEOPLE COME TO REALIZES THAT OUR PERCEPTION OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS STRONGLY INFORMED BY THE GROUP THAT WE SEE OURSELVES IN AND OFTTO OUR OWN DETRIMENT ABSOLUTELY YAT SO THIS IS A STUDY FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND INTO YOUR POINT YOU KNOW WE TEND TO THINK OPAY WERE HUMAN BEINGS WERE REALLY ENLIGHTENED WERE MAKING DECISIONS AND WHERE AH ENGAGING IN JUDGMENTS OF THINGS BASED ON DATA AN EVIDENCE AND FACT AN YOU KNOW SURELY MY VISUAL SYSTEM WOULDN'T LIE TO ME SO WHATEVER I PERCEIVE IS GOING TO BE TRUE AN VERITICAL VERTICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD AND LIKE NOT TRUE OKA A LOT OF ARE UM BELIEF AND THESE ARE THESE ARE STRONG BELIEFS IN MEN AGAIN THET THERE WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE FACT ABOUT THE WORLD IS IN FORMED BY OUR GROUP MEMBERSHIP SO IN THE STUDY U LOYAL A FANS OF TWO OPPOSING FOOTBALL TEAMS WATCH THESE CONTROVERSAL A PLAYES RIHT SO WERE THE REFERI MADE A CALL AND THEY WEREN'T QUITE CERTAIN IF IT WAS LIKE IN OR OUT LET'S SAY AND UM DEPENDING ON YOUR LOYALTY TO THE TEAM TO WHATEVER SPORTS TEAM RIGHT WHICHEVER SIDE YOU WERE ON YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FAVOR CALLS THAT WERE MADE ON YOUR TEAMS UM NIN YOR IN YOUR TAMS FAVOR AN YOU KNOW WE YOU ASK PEOPLE COMING OUT OF A STUDY LIKE THIS IT'S NOT LIKE YE I KNEW I WAS BIASED LIKE I KNEW THAT I WAS BASING MY JUDGMENT OF THESE REFERI CALLS BASED ON MY AFFILIATION AN MY LOVE OF IF TEAM ACS OR TEAM WHY UM YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT YOU THINK YOU WERE AN ARBITER OF TRUTH IN THE SITUATION YOU'RE JUST RECALLING WHAT YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM SAW AND I THINK THAT SHOWS HOW POWERFUL THESE SOCIAL FORCES ARE HOW POWERFUL OUR GROUP OF FILIATIONS ARE BECAUSE IT CAN TRULY CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU SEA STUFF RIGHT OF COURSE IT CAN THEN TRANSFORM THE WAY THAT YOU THINK OF THAT STUFF UM AND SO THAT TO ME IS A POWERFUL REMINDER THAT WHEN WE ARE IN DISAGREEMENT WITH SOME ONE ELSE UM AND WE JUST TRYD TO BEBARD THEM WITH FACTS RIGHT AND YOU'RE SCIENTISTS RIGHT SO WITH YOUR HEARING SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING IN YOUR LIKE A THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT ACCURATE THAT'S NOT TRUE YOUR YOU'R INSTINCT PROBABLIES SAY BUT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY THE PURE VEU JOURNAL ARTICLE FROM PUG THAT THA DOES NOT RIGHT AN BUT WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE THAT ACTUALLY A LARGE PART OF OUR BELIEF SYSTEM A EMERGES FROM THE GROUPS TAT WE IDENTIFY WITH IT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S AN INSPIRING LESSON THAT COMES FROM THAT SO WE SHOULDN'T BE TOO DISHEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT THIS IS TRUE BUT IT HELPS AROUND AT OUR UNDER STANDING WHY IT IS THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE THE THINGS THEY DO AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE MORE RESOURCES AT HAND TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN CHANGE THEIR MINDS RIGHT SO ONE OF THE GUIDES THAT I INTERVIEW O MY PODCAST A HIS NAME IS DARELL DAVIS HE'S A BLACK DA'S MUSICIAN AND A HE WAS CONFRONTED BY A MEMBER OF THE CUCCLUS CLAN AT ONE OF HIS PERFORMANCES AND IT LED TALK ABOUT A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS I MEAN HE JUST WENT ON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LIFE PATH AND ENDED AP AM CONVINCING DOZENS OF PEOPLE TO LIEVE WHITE SUPREMACY GROUPS INCLUDING THE CUCLUS CLAN AND AM YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO DARRELL AND HIS APPROACH WILL ONE HE RECRUITED PEOPLE'S AGENCY SO HE NEVER IMPLIED TO THEM OH I'M TRYING TO CHANGE THEIR MIND AM HE INSPIRED HE ALWAYS SAYS LIKE I DIDN'T CONVINCE THEM MIA THEY CONVINCE THEMSELVES TO CHANGE THEIR MIND SO HE RECRUITED THEIR AGENCY A BUT HE ALSO TRIED HIS ABSOLUTE HARDEST TO NOT QUESTION THEIR FUNDAMENTAL AND UNDERLYING HUMANITY WRIGHT SO HE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND LIKE WHY ARE YOU PARTED THIS GROUP THIS VILE TETRIOLIC GROUP AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD SHARE WILL YOU KNOW IT'S A FAMILY TRADITION THING MY FATHER WAS IN THE CLAN THE GRANDFATHERS IN THE CLAN LOOK NONE OF THIS EXCUSES BEING IN A HATE GROUP OHEH BUT IT LEAST GAVE DARRELL AND UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THE THE FACTORS THAT WERE PUSHING THEM TOWARDS THE GROUP SO THAT HE MIGHT OFFER THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY THAT SENSIVE BELONGING SOMEWHERE ELSE MAYBE OUTSIDE OF A HATE GROUP RIGHT BUT IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY JUST FIGHTING OVER FACTS OVER WHETHER AFRICAN AMERICANS SHOULD BE TREATED A EQUAL TO EVERYONE ELSE THAN HE WOULD HAVE LOST THAT THAT A ARGUMENT BECAUSE HE WAS' EVEN FIGHTING WITH THE RIGHT CURRENCY WRITE WHAT WAS RELEVANT SO A WHAT WAS SO A THIS IS MY IT WAS THE FIRST EPISODE OF A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS WE EVER RELEASED AND CONTINUES TO ME MY FAVORITE BECAUSE WHAT WAS SO THRILLING ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW IS THAT THE STRATEGIES DARRELL USED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS AGAIN IF THESE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED HORRIFIC VIEWS WERE TOTALLY CORROBERATED BY THE SCIENCE OF HOW HE CHANGE PEOPLE'S MINDS SO HE DIDN'T USE A LOT OF REALLY EFFECTIE STRATEGIES JUST INTUITIVELY BUT HE'S JUST A MASTER MIND THE HEVRIAL SCIENCIST JUST BY VIRTUE OF WHO HE IS AM BUT HE HE SHOWED GENUINE CURIOSITY AH FOR WHY IT IS THEY BELIEVE WHAT THEY DID WHICH IS AGAIN EXTREMELY HARDENS I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE EQUANIMITY TO SHOW GENUINE CURIOSITY FOR WHY SOME ONE IS IN THE CUCLUX'S PLAN BUT HE SHOWED THAT CURIOSITY HE INCREASED ON THE HIS QUESTION TO STATEMENT RATIO SINCE REALLY IMPORTINT TO ASK PEOPLE A LOT OF QUESTIONS  AND THEN AND THEN HE WOULD ASK PEOPLE AM A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS WELL WHAT IN THEORY COULD CHANGE YOUR MIND LIK WHAT EVIDENCE WOULD I HAVE TO GIVE YOU IN ORDER TO CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT EXQUIRSY AND THE REASON THAT I LOVE ASKING THAT QUESTION IS THAT IT CPREASE SUPPOSS THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO BE WILLING TO CHANGE THEIR MIND IN THE FACE OF NEW INFORMATION SO THIS HEARKENS BACK TO THE CONVERSATION OR HAVING EARLIER ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A VALUABLE SAY OF MINE OF BEING WILLING TO UPDATE IN THE FACE OF NEW INFAL NOW IF THE PERSON I RESPONSE SAYS LITERALLY NOTHING WILL CHANGE MY MIND LOOK IT WILL THEN YOU KNOTICE NOT WORTH YOUR TIME TO HAVE THE DISAGREEMENT WITH THEM BUT IF THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT AND SAY WELL MAYBE I WOULD CHANGE MY MIND ON VACSINES IF YOU WERE TO TELL ME EXQUIRSY MAYBE I WOUL CHANGE MY MINDS ON MY MIND ON EMIGRATION REFORM IF YOU WERE TELL ME YOU KNOW THIS OR THAT NOW YOU HAVE AN IN RIGHT BUT YOU DO NEED TO GET THEM INTO THE STATE OF MIND WHERE THEY THINK YET I GUESS IN THEORY I COULD CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THIS THING THAT I FEEL ABSOLUTY RESOLUTE ABOUT I'VE NEVER WORKED IN PUBLIC POLICY AM BAT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT WHERE I SEE FAILURES AND MASS OF YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY OR EDUCATIONAL POLICY ALMOST ALWAYS THERE SEEMS TO BE A FAILURE OF EVEN INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT MOTIVATES THE OTHER SIDES POSITION AND THIS IS WHERE I JUST THIS ACTUALLY GETS ME AM FRUSTRATE TO THE POINT OF MOTIVATED WHERE IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU'RE WRONG YOU'R WRONG KNOW THIS KNOW THAT  TO THE POINT OF IT'S ALMOST MADDENING AND FAR MORE SELDOM A DO WE SEE PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW O KA IMEN A THIRD PERSON MYSELF FOR I MOEN T PUT MYSELF ON THE OTHER PERSON SHOOES AND SAY TYOU WHY MIGHT THEY FEEL THAT WAY WHY WOULD THIS PERSON BE LISTENING TO THIS INDIVIDUAL AS OPPOSED TO THIS PUBLIC HEALTH AT A INDIVIDUAL AND LOOK YOU KNOW WITHOUT TAKING ANY STANDS ON THIS CAUSE IS MUCH BIGGER CONVERSATION THAN WE WANT TO HAVE RIGHT NOW I COULD LOOK AT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS THAT JUST COMPLETELY FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THE OTHER SIDES POSITION AND VICE VERSA AND THAT TO ME JUST SAYS IT'S A COMMUNICATION FAILURE A AND I I'LL TAKE THIS OUT OF THE A COVI PANDEMIC AM DISCUSSION AS IT'S NORMALLY HAD AND SAY THAT YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO REALLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT STILL TWENTY TWENTY THREE A LANDSCAPE THERE WERE SO MANY MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN 'S WRIGT EVERYBODY I REGARDLESS OF WHERE PEOPLE WERE ON THE VACSINE TO BATE NAS DE BATE LOCKED DOWN TEBATE REGARDLESS OF ANY OF THAT EVERY ONE STRESS LEVEL WAS ELEVATED E AND THERE WERE VERY VERY FEW AM TOP DOWN FROM AT THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTS DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HAW TO MAINTAIN CIRCATIAN RHYTHM AND SLEEP HEALTH HOW TO MAINTAIN HEALTH IN GENERAL IN THAT LANDSCAPE AND THAT FOR FOR ME WAS JUST REALLY SHOCKING IT WAS ALSO ONE O THE REASONS WHY WE LAUNCH THE POD CAST FRANKLY AS THAT I REALLY FEEL THAT THE TOOLS WERE NEEDED BY EVERYBODY AND SHOULD BE ZERO COST TO EVERYBODY BUT WHAT WAS CLEAR IS THERE WAS SO MUCH POINTING OF FINGERS AND NAME CALLING AND AND VIOLENCE EVEND THAT NO ONE WAS SAYING LIKE WHY WOULD PEOPLE FEEL THIS WAY WHY WOULD PEOPLE TRUST THESE SOURCES AS OPPOSED TO THESE SOURCES AND WE CAN ONLY CONCLUDE IF WE'RE GOOD SCIENTISTS THAT AM THE THE THE LANDSCAPE WAS INEFFECTIVE RIGHT LAS  IN EFFECT AND IT CONTINUES A MANY IF YOU GO IF YOU HAVE THE UM THE DESIRE TO TAKE A REDUCTION IN DOPEMING BY GOING ON TWITTER AND FOLLOWING THIS BACK AND FORTH A CONTINUES TO DAY IT'S IT'S PRETTY UGLY STILL NONE OF IT SEEMS REALLY SOLUTIONARY AND THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE OUT THERGH WHER TRY TO MAKE IT SOLUTION ORY INTED BUT UM NOT REALLY AND SO II DON'T WANT O AMEO GOING TO THE DARK ASPECTS HERE BUT BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE AM THIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHY OTHERS MIGHT FEEL THE OPPOSITE OF HOW WE FEEL IS A VERY RARE QUALITY AND THIS GENTLEMAN DARELL WHAT WAS ISLAN ARELL DAVIS I THINK II'VE SEEN A NUMBER THINGS WITH HIM ITSELF AND AN HE'S OBSY EXTRAORDINARY UM BUT WE CALL IN THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE HIM WERE EXCEEDINGLY RARE SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO CULTIVATE THAT KIND OF MIND SAA BECAUSE I'M NOT POINTING FINGERS HERE A ANYTHING WE ALL HAVE THIS DEFAULT TENDENCY TO GATHER EVIDENCE THE WAY THAT WE GATHER EVIDENCE DRAW CONCLUSIONS AND THEN STAND OUR GROUND AND I THINK IT'S DETRIMENTAL TA TO EVERYONE SO YOU'RE MAKING ME REFLECT ON PROBABLY THE GREATEST GIFT THAT BEING A COGNAT OF SCIENTIST HAS GIVEN ME IN MY LIFE AM OBVIOUSLY ITS PET MY CURIOSITY HADS BEEN DELIGHT TO STUDY THINGS AND LEARN THINGS FOR THE GREATEST GIFT IT IS GIVEN ME IS EMPATHY TOWORDS PEOPLE IT IS THE GREATEST DRIVER AF HUMAN EMPATHY TO LEARN HOW OUR MINES WORK AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT PARTLY THAT'S WHY I STARTED A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS WE HAVE STORY EPISODES WERE YOU HEARE FROM PEOPLE LIKE DARRELL BUT I ENTERVIES SCIENTIST FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD ABOUT THEIR AREAS VEX FORTICE AND I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT HOW THE MINE WORKS THE MORE WE LEARN FROM MY FEEL THE COGNA SCIENCE BUT HOW WE'D MAKE DECISIONS HOW WE DEVELOP OUR ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS ABOUT THE WORLD HOW WE COME TO BE THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE THE MORE WE CAN BRIDGE THESE EMPTITY GAFTS AND IT'S BEEN PROFOUND FOR ME I MEAN I FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN STEEPED IN THIS LITERATURE FOR DECATES NOW MY HOPE IS TO INVITE PEOPLE INTO THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT WHY PEOPL ARE THE WAY THEY ARE THE MORE EMPITHY YOU CAN EXTEND AND THE MORE NOT EVEN SAY YOU GOT IT YOU NEED TO EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH NOT SAYING THAT YOU NEED TO COMPROMISE YOUR OWN BELIEF SYSTEM BUT AT LEAST YOU SEE THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN ENTRY POINT A REASON TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THIS PERSON WHO BELIEVES THINGS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM YOU AND I WE TALKED ABOUT GRATITUDE ABIT IN THIS CONVERSATION I FEEL IMMENSE GRATITUDE THAT I HAVE A POSTURE OF EMPATHY AS I MOVE AROUND IN THIS WORLD BECAUSE I REGLIN I HAVE I HAVE STRONG BELIEFS ON THINGS I CARE A LOT I CARE ABOUT REDUCING HUMAN SUFFERING AND THAT I MEED SOMEONE WHOM I THINK IS PRO APOLICY THAT PROMOTES HUMAN SUFFERING AND OF COURSE THE VITERAL HUMAN INSTINCT DISLIKE TOHEW WITH YOU IN YOUR VIEW POINT THIS IS HORRIBLE THIS IS INTOLERABLE BUT BECAUSE I HAVE THIS COGNIT OF SCIENCE HAD ON IT ALLOWS ME TO WALK AROUND WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW POINT AND I REALLY FEEL THN IAM A BETTER PERSON AS A RESULT OF THAT AND I AND IAVE HEARD FROM LISTENERS OF A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS WHEN THEY LISTEN TO THESE SCIENCE EPISODES WHE THERE'S THE SCIENCE OF LONELINESS THE SCIENCE AND EMPATHY THE SCIENCE OF MEDITATION LIKE I TRY TO BRING THIS EMPATHETIC SPEND TO TO UNDERSTANDING AGAIN NARROW SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY THEY HAVE FOUND THAT THEY ARE KINDER TO OTHERS AND SO THAT'S AS HARBLY THE BEST FEE BACK THAT I'VE EVER RECEIVED ON THE SHOW IS LIKE PEOPLE ARE LIKE I'M A NICER PERSON TO OTHER PEOPLE NOW ESPECIALY THE ONCE I DON'T AGREE WITH AM PRESUMELY TO THEMSELVES AS WELL IMAN I KNO A YOU'VE BROUGHT UP THE TOPIC OF EMPATHEOUS AWAY TO PREVENT BURN OUT RIGHT THAT I'M IN HEREN NOT TO STRIE MA JOB BURN OUT OR TIME OUT THE BURN OUT THAT IS EREN'TO LIKE ANY LONG  TERM PURSUIT THAT'S CHALLENGING RAISING HEADS O BEING IN A FAMILY WHAT IS THE GREAT ROM DOT QUOTE YOU NO THINK YOUR ENLIGHTENED GO SPEND A WEEK WITH YOUR PARENT OIA A YOU KNOW LIKE NO MATTER HOW LIK AND YOU ARE LIKIN I I I HAS ALWAYS JI REMIND MYSELF  OF MY FNTE ANDOF MY PARENTS BUT WHEN YOU KNOW YOU IJUJUST O COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WHAT TH I AM SHIFT TO  HAD ALSO KIND TO ONES SELF AN N I THINK THERE'S STORTING TO BE SOME GOOD NARROW SCIENCE THAT THE MECHANISTIC LEVEL OF OF EMPATHY AM CLEARLY IT EMPATHY IS NOT THE DEFAULT STATE FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CULTIVATE AS A PRACTICE AND TAT WE CAN CULTIVATE IS A PRACTICE ALONG THE LINES OF EMPATHY BUT ALSO RETURNING TO A TOPIC THAT WE OPEN TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WITH UM YOU KNOW WE BUILD THESE NARRATIVES ABOUT OURSELVES STARTING IN ADOLESCENCE MAY BEVEN EARLIER AND THROUGH OUR TENIERS THAN WE HAVE VARIOUS EXPERIENCES BUT I'M CURES HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD NARRATIVES ABOUT OURSELVES AND THE ROLE OF NARRATIVE YOU KNOW THAT THE I STATEMENTS TH I AM STATEMENT  UM AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU AND WE SHOULD ALL SPEND SOME TIME YOU'N DOING THAS OMMING THESE DAYS SE ON PEOPLE EXERCISE AS WE KNOW IT'S GOOD FOR US PEOPLE GET SOME LIKE ASE THEY KNOW IT'S GREAT FOR THEM AM THAT PEOPLE PERHAPS OF A MEDITATION PRACTICE OR THERE BE PRACTICE ARE JOURNALING PRACTICE BUT HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO EVOLVE OUR NARRATIVES ABOUT SELF IN A WAY THAT PROMOTES SOME ARE ALL OF THE THINGS HAT WEVE BEEN TALKING ON TO DAY YES SO EMPATHY'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK U WE HAVE LOT OF MIS CONCEPTIONS ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE MIS CONCEPTIONS ABOUT HOW EMPATHETICAL WE ACTUALLY ARE I WOULD ARGUE PEOPLE ARE MORE EMPATHETIC THAN THEY THINK AND WHEN WE TELL YOU I SO THIS COMES FROM RESEARCH BY MY MY FRIEND AN NELSOKY AT STAMFORD AM THERE'S THREE DISTINCT TYPES OF EMPATHY WHY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT SO THE FIRST KIND IS EMOTIONAL EMPATHY AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT FEELS VERY INTUITIVE TO MUS SO IT'S THIS VICERABL REACTION I HAVE WE TELL ME THAT YOU'VE HAD A REALLY HARD TIME MY EYES START TO WELL OF S I I CAN TRULY FEEL YOUR PAIN AND A I JUST FEEL WHAT YOU FEEL OHE AND TAT TIPICALLY IS THE IS WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY THINK OF EMPATHY PERIOD THEY OVERLOOK TWO OTHER TYPES OF EMPATHY THE SECOND TYPE IS CALLED COGNITIVE EMPATHY THIS IS THE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY DIAGNOSES WHAT IT IS HT'S CAUSING YOU DISTRESS IN THIS MOMENT AND WHAT IT IS THAT I COULD OFFER UP TO YOU TO TRY TO HELP AMELIORATE SOME OF YOUR SUFFERING THE THIRD KIND IS CALLED IMPATHIC CONCERN OR IT'S KNOWN AS COMPASSION AS WELL WHICH IS THE ACTUAL DESIRE TO HELP YOU DESIRE TO HELP ANOTHER PERSON AND WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ABOUT THESE THREE TYPES OF EMPATHY IS THAT THEY DON'T QUARRELATE WITH EM PEOPLE YOU CAN BE REALLY HIGH IN THE EMOTIONAL EMPATHY SCALE RIGHT YOU CAN HAVE TEARS STREAMING DOWN YOUR FACE AS YOU HEAR ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS DIVORCE BUT YOU MIGHT BE REALLY BAD AT DIAGNOSING WHAT IT IS THAT'S CAUSING THEM DISTRESS YOU MIGHT BE REALLY BAD AT ACTUALY OFFERING UP AM A SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEM OR YOU MIGHT LACK THE WILL RIGHT LIKE IF YOUR SOCIAPATHY YOU MIHT JUST NOT HAVE THE WILL TO HELP SOME ONE RIGHT AN AM WHAT'S SO INTERESTING IS THAT I THINK IN OUR SOCIETY IN THIS THIS RELATES BACK TO IDENTITYAN AND AND THE LABELS WE GIVE OURSELVES I THINK OUR SOCIETY PUTS A HUGE PREMIUM ON EMOTIONAL EMPATHY AND WE DISCOUNT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT VISERAL RESPONSE AND WE JUST IMMEDIATELY SAY OH THEY'RE NOT EMPATHETIC AND THIS HAPPENS FROM THE TIME THAT WERE REALLY LITTLE BY THE WAY LIKE THE KID WHOSE CRYING ON THE PLAYGROUND COMFORTING THEIR FRIEND RIGHTS E'RE LIKE WHILE THAT THAT KIDS GOT A TON OF EMPATHIA MY OLDER KID DOESN'T SEEM TO RALLY CARE ABOUT PEOPLE BUT THEY MIGHT EXCEL IN COGNITIVE EMPATHY THEY MIGHT EXCEL WHEN IT COMES TO COMPASS IMPATHIC CONCERN SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH YEUMEAL ON A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS IS YOU KNOW MAYBE WE OUGHT TO THNK ABOUT EMPATHY LANGUAGES IN THE SAME WAY WE THINK ABOUT LOVE LANGUAGES PEOPLE AVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF EXPRESSING THEIR EMPATHY AND WE OUGHT TO VALUE THEM EQUALLY AND AM THAT'S BEEN WONDERFUL BECAUSE I THINK EVEN IN THE PASS LIKE I WOULD HAVE HAD A REALLY HARD SITUATION MIGHT GO TO ONE OF MY FRIENDS AND THEY JUST SEEM LIKE A LITTLEOF IT MORE STOIC AND I'M LIKE YOU CAN GIVE A SHIT WHY DO YOU NOT CARE AS MUCH AS I WANT YOU TO CARE IT TURNS OUT THEIR FANTASTIC AT WANTING TO HELP ME AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME AND AM I LOVE THE IDEA OF GIVING A LITTLE MORE LOVE TO THOSE SECOND TWO BUCKETS BEAUSE I HINK IT ALLOW US TO BETTER RECRUIT MORE EMPATY FROM OTHERS AND ALSO TO SEE OURSELVES DIFFERENTLY TO MAYBE FOR THOSE PEOPLE AT THARE HO ARE LIKE A NOT A VERY EMPATHETIC PERSON YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE MORE EMPATHETIC THAN YOU THINK I THES SECOND THING I WANTED TO SHARE IS ABOUT BURN OUT WRIGHTS YOU TALK A ITTL ABOUT ABOUT BURN OUT PEOPLE WHO RATE REALLY HIGH ON THE EMOTIONAL EMPATHY'S SCALE TEND TO EXPERIENCE BURN OUT AT HIGHER RATE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS FIRST RESPONDERS ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU FEEL EMOTIONAL EMPATHY AS YOU ARE YOURE YOURE CARRYING THE BURDEN OF THE OTHER PERSON'S PAINS YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE HOW THAT CAN DEPLEATE YOU AND I THINK THE INSTINCT THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE'RE EMPATHETIC IS TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M JUST BEN A SHUT MYSELF OFF I HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE IN TWENTY TWENTY I WAS LIKE THERE'S TOO MUCH BAD STUFF HAPPENING AROUND ME LIKE I PREFER TO JUST NOT FEEL THINGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO I TRYD TO CLOSE MYSELF OFF FROM NATURAL EMOTIONAL REACTIONS I WOULD HAVE TO THINGS BUT WHAT GEMIALS A RESEARCH SHOWS IS THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO IF YOU CULTIVATE COGNITIVE EMPATHY AND IMPATHIC CONCERN THOSE CAN NACTUALLY BE PROTECTIVE AGAINST BURN OUT SO YU DON'T HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH EMPATHY ALTOGETHER YOU JUST HAVE TO SHIFT GEARS AND BE MORE SELECTED ABOUT THE KIND AND EMPATHY THAT YOU'RE INVESTING IN SO I LOVE THIS RESEARCH COULD GET IT JUST LIKE OPENS YOUR MIND UP TO THIS WHOLE WORLD OF EMPATHY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS MORETS LIKE THE SINGULAR CONCEPT AND ALLOWS THERE TO BE A LITLEA BIT MORE GRACEFACE I LOVE THE IDEA THAT THERE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF EMPATHY IT WILL ALSO AR ME WITH A RESPONSE WI EVER IPATHETICALLY SO ONE SAYS I DON'T FEEL LIKE YOUR REALLY FEELING WHAT I'M FEELING IN THEREFOR YOU'RE NOT IMPATHIC TO MY EXPERIENCE I I I BUT WHERE I RATE ON THESE SCALES ISN'T IMPORTANT BUT UM THIS NO CHOCOGNEIVFE EMPATHY I THING IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IMPROUDLY ONE THAT MOST FEELL HAVEN'T HEARD OF I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT UM BUT I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT REALLY DOES SUXGIST ON THAT IT'S AT LEAST A YOU MIGHT HAVE IT IN SPAN I I DON'T KNOW THOW N I'D AV TO ASK THE PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME BUT BUT THAT IT IS AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS THE EMOTIONAL EMPE ATY BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THERE IS SOMETHING THAT UM I UNFORTUNATELY UM PUSHED US PAST TOO QUICKLY THAT I WANT TO RETURN TO BECAUSE I THINK IT SOMETHING THAT UM SO MANY PEOPLE CARE ABOUT AND LIVE WITH EACH DAY WHICH IS THIS ISSU CHALLENGES WITH ON GOING ONTOVATION AND FORGET I FOR FOR UM NOW I'M NOT THAT AN O EN A NAT I'M NOTHIN A NA A'M SOR YUNPING A ACT TO THIS BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT I I PULLED US OFF TO ANOTHER TOPIC BUT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE MIDDLE PROBLEM BE Y AN IT'S AND IT'S TOO IMPORTANT TO UM TO NOT RETURN TO YAS SO U TELLS SAWOUT THE MIDDLE PROBLEM AN HOW WE CAN OVERCOME THE MIDDLE PRAND AND BEFORE IT YOU THAT YOU MIND IF I GIVE JUST A COUPLE SHORT STRATEGIES AROUND GOALL SETTING I JUS ON TO MAKTURY ROUND OUT THAT SEC AND NOT ONLY WOULD I CNOT MIND I I I'D BE DELI IT'S NONT TO MAKES SURE AGAIN I YER SHARE SHARE THE WISDOM THAT'S HELL AY SO MUCH IN MY PERSONAL LIFE O AY SO  AND  I'LL TRY TO BE FAST SO THE EARTHTA IT IS TAKE YOUR T U BUT I YOUPLL HAVE THESE GULLS TO RE TRY T IO GOT TO GET THEM GOT THE OUT RUNNING M SO THE FIRST IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE SO WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT APPROACH FOR VERSES AVOIDANT GULLS RIGHT WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WHO SECS THE GAL MATTERS AND HOW IF IT'S YOU IT'S BETTER RIGHT IF YOU HAVE SOME OWNERSHIP OVER YOUR TARGETS THE THIRD THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOURE SETTING GOALS WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SAME PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE AS THE ONE YOU'LL BE IN WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY PURSUING THE GUAL M BECAUSE WE TEND TO HAVE WHAT ARE KNOWN AS THIS IS AGAIN IOLET FISH BOX FOR WE TENT TO HAVE EMPITY GAPS BETWEEN OUR PRESENT DAY SELVES IN OUR FUTURE SELVES AND THAT EMPITY GAP CAN LEAD US TO BE VERY COMPASSIONATE TO WORDS FOUR PIM ON SUNDAY WASHING T D MYA RIGHT AND SIX A M MYA WHO I HOPE IS GOING TO BE GAT THE GIM LIKE IN A CRUT KILLING HERSELF WITH A REALLY HIGH AND TESSY INTERVALS SET OR WHAT NOT AND SO IF IF IT IS FOUR PIAM ON SUNDAY PROLLING OUT THE BEST TIME FOR YOU TO SAY OM EN TO GO TO THE GIM EVERY DAY SIX A M IF YOU ACTUALLY ARE AT THE GIM AT SIX A M AND YOU ARE FEELING VICERILY THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PAIN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN OF HAVING GOTTEN UP REALLY EARLY TO DO THE WORK OUT THEN IT'S REASONABLE FOR YOU TO SET THAT GOAL BUT IT'S KIND OF THE OPPOSITE IFE LIKE THEY SAY LIKE DON'T GO TO SUPER MARKET HUNGRY RIGHT ACTUALLYN THIS SITUATION YOU WANT TO BE IN EXACTLY THE SAME PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SAT YOU'LL BE IN WHEN YOU'RE IN GOAL PURSUIT IT'LL MAKE IT MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT YOU SET REASONABLE GOALS AND YOU ACTUALLYOU REACH TEM THE SECOND THING I'M THAT YOU MIGHTWANT TO THINK ABOUT IS SO DONT NOW THAT YOU ENTER BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M THE GOAL PUREST BY NATURE SO WHEN I SET A GOAL THE MINUTE I LIKE FALL OFF EVEN SLIGHTLY THE GOAL IS GONE FOR ME OEY AND I'M LIKE AH I MESST UP LIKE LET'S START FROM THE BEGINNING LETS START FROM SCRATCH AND YOUD A NEW GOAL LIKE I'VE ALREADY I'VE ALEADY MASSTOP AND IT IESN'T MATTER SIGHT I FEEL LIKE UNLESS I I I ACHIEVE PERFECTION IN ACHIEVING MY GOALS I GET VERY FRUSTRATE AND I JUST FALL OFF THE WAGON COMPLETELY SO ONE THING THAT RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN IS THAT IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO BUILD IN WHAT'S CALLED AN EMERGENCY RESERVE INTO YOUR GOAL SETTING EARLY SLACK IS ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING IT SO LET'S SAY I HAVE A GOAL I WANT O GO TO THE GIM EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS MONTH IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL TO GIVE YOURSELF AND YOU'RE NOT GOING SOFT ON YOURSELF I PROMISE TO GIVE YOURSELF FOR EXAMPLE THREE GET A A JAIL FREE CARDS THREE DAYS WHERE FOR WHATEVER REASON IT'S O KAY THAT YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE GIM YOU GOT SICK YOU BE OF KIDS WHO GOT SICK YOU'RE JUST NOT FEELING MOTIVATED IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WITH THE REASON IS YOU DIN'T GO T THE GIM BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU'RE STILL UNTRACK TO ACHIEVING YOUR GOAL EVEN IF YOU MISS THOSE THREE DAYS BECAUSE YOU BUILT THEM INTO THE SYSTEM AN THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY ABOUT AM SETTING THE GOAL IS TO TRY TO CAPITALIZE ON A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THE FRESH START EFFECT SO THIS IS WORKD BY MY FRIEND KATY MILKMEN SHE'S A PROFESSOR AT WHARTON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SO WHAT SHE'S FOUND IS THAT IN OUR LIVES WE HAVE THESE BIG MILESTONE MOMENTS WHERE WE BREAK FROM THE PAST AND WHE'RE ENTERING A NEW FUTURE OHE THIS MIGHT BE MOVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT COULD BE GETTING A NEW JOB IT COULD BE GETTING MERRIED IT COULD BE WHATEVER OHEY BUT IT FEELS LIKE A BIG CHANGE AND THAT'S A WONDERFUL MOMENT TO TRY TO INTRODUCE A NEW SET OF PATTERNS INTO YOUR LIFE IN PART BECAUSE AGAIN AM YOU HAVE A BREAKAN IDENTITY BUT TOO IT'S REALLY EASY TO INTRODUCE NEW HABITS WHEN A LOT OF YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT SO I TAKE A NEW JOB ALL THE SUN IOFE A NEW OUT TO WORK PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA DID NOT INTRODUCE A PASTRY STOP EVERY TIME I GO TO WORK IS I NO LONGER AND PASSING BY THAT VAGARY EVERY MORNING AM SEE ONE TO CAPITALIZE ON FRESH STARTS OF THAT KIND THERE'S ALSO A MORE ARBITRARY FREST STARTS THAT EXISTS FOR ALL OF US AND THIS IS IN THE FORMENT THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEARS OF CHRIST NEER'S RESOLUTIONS THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING EVEN THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK CAN BE VERY MOTIVATING BECAUSE WE ALL LIKE CLEAN SLIHTS WE LIKE A WIPEEN AWAY THE PAST WE LIKE EMBARKING ON A NEW FUTURE A THAT'S THAT'S CLEAN A FAILURE AND STUMBLING AND WHAT NOT AND SO THAT CAN BE EARLY POWERFUL MOTIVATOR I LOVE THESE SUGGESTIONS A BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE LIKE A CLEAN START THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT WHO KNOWS WHY BUT I THINK IT' IT'S A A UNIVERSAL TRAIT AM AND PERHAPS SHORTENING THE TIME DOMAIN OVER WHICH WE THINK ABOUT OUR GULLS AND SUCCESS IN FAILURE COULD HELP I CAN  JUST SAY YOU NOVE THE CLEAN START IS THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE THIS MORNING WASN'T YEU O DIDN'T GO SO WELL YEI D NOT I SURRENDER THE WHOLE WEEK TO RTYOU VESTEP ON A MONDAY MORNING THAT'S FOR IDEA I'M SENSING THE PERFECTIONISTIN YOU AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S IT'S A CONTINUUM YOS SOME PEOPLE I DON'T AM UNLESS A SUFFER FROM PERFECTIONISM TAS I THINK IT'S IT'S A GREAT ATTRIBUTE IN CERTAIN DOMAINS AND  CAN BE CHALLENGING IN OTHERS BUT A I LOVE THE IDEA OF A HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF GRACE AM WITH ONE'S GULLS AND ALSO WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER OF MAKING THE CURAT COMPELLING YOU KNOW A NOT SO MUCH FOCASSING ON JUST THE STICK A MAKING THE CARET MORE COMPELLING AM SO MUCH THERE WHAT ABOUT THE MIDDLE PROBLEM YES A MCAUSE I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE A DU TEND TO GO GO HARD OUT TO DA AS IT WERE AN THAN PEOPLE DROP OFF YE SO YET ALL THE SEFF WE TALKED ABOUT SO FAR AS BEEN AROUND DEFINDING THE GOAL AND NOW WE NED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE SUSTAIN OUR MOTIVATION TO PURSUIT A GAL AND THIS CAN BE SUPERHARD IM IT AGAIN BEHAVIOUR CHANGE IS EXCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY HARD TO SUSTAIN IM SO THE MIDDLE PROBLEM SO THE MIDDLE PROBLEM FERST TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE STABLE AMOUNTS OF MOTIVATION OVER THE COURSE OF GOAL PURSUIT WE TEND TO HAVE A BOOSTON MOTIVATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PURSUIT WE ALL FEEL THIS VISERLY RIGHT I'VE DECIDED I'M GET DO INERINFASTING OR I'M GOINGTO MAKE SURE I LOOK AT YOU KOW THE SUN EVERY MORNING THE FIRST MOMENT THAT I GET UT OR WHAT WHATEVER THE GOAL IS IN THAT FIRST DAY YOU ARE SO MOTIVATED TO GET IT DONE RIGHT INFACT THE FIRST FEW DAYS THE FIRST FEW WEEKS IM AND THEN YOU EXPERIENCE A A BOOSE IN MOTIATION A HIGHER AMOUNT OF MOTIVATION TOWARDS THE END OF THE GOAL I'M SO WE EXPERIENCE AT THE END OF A GOAL WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE GOAL GRADIENT EFFECT SO WE TEND TO EXPERIENCE MONOTONIC INCREASES IN MOTIVATION THE CLOSER WE ARE TO THE FINISH LINE SO WE MIGHT EVEN SEE IN MARITHON RUNNERS RIGHT THEIR LIKE GO CAN I ONLY HAVE THIS REMAINING PART TO GO I CAN EXPEND ALL MY ENERGY NOW TO TRY TO GET OVER THE FINISH LINE THERE'S A LULL THOUGH IN MOTIVATION IN THE MIDDLE OF GOAL PURSUIT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO GET AHEAD OF WE WANT A SALVE FOR NOW OBVIOUSLY WE CANNOT ELIMINATE MIDDLES MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE MIDDLES SO WHAT DO WE DO WILL WE DO SOMETHING THAT YOU AREADY ALLUDED TO WHICH IS ACTUALLY SHORT IN THE TIME DURATION OF OUR GOALS SO RATHER THAN SETTING AN ANNUAL GOAL RIGHT LET'S SAY THAT IT'S THE NEW YEAR YOU'RE INSPIRED TO TRY TO MAKE TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE BEST YEAR EVER BUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS WHEN YOU SET IN ANNUAL GOAL NOW YOUR MIDDLE IS MONTHS LONG SE'RE GAN EXPERIENCE THAT DE CREASE IN MOTIVATION FOR A HEALTHY TRUNK OF THE YEAR WHICH IS NOT IDEAL IF YOU SET A WEEKLY GOAL BY CONTRAST ALL OF TH SUN YOUR MIDDLES A LOT SHORTER RIGHT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOUR DEALING WITH LIKE A FEW DAYS MAYBE A DAY OR TO AND SO YOU WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF OF THE DURATION A OF THE GOALL ANOTHER THING THAT CAN HELP ON KEEP MOTIVATION HIGH IS TO DO OUT WHEN MY FRIEND KATY MILKMAN CALLS TEMPTATION BUNDLING SO THIS IS NUBER ONE THEN THE MIGHT GO TO STRATEGY FOR HAVING DONE EVERY UNPLEASANT ACTIVITY IN MY LIFE THAT I'VE HAD TO DO OEH FOLDING LAUNDRY DOING THE DISHES I SHOULD REALLY LIKE WORKING OUT LIKE YOU DO SO I DON'T NEED AS MUCH MOTIVATION BUT SOMETIMES I STOLL NEE FOR HIGH INTENSITY DAYS I DO NEED THE MOTIVATION TO DO LIKE THTHE HARD CARDIO SO TO GET ON TO GET ON ON INTO WORKING OUT IN THAT WAY IM SO WHAT IS TEMPTATION BUNDLING YOU'RE PAIRING AN UNPLEASANT ACTIVITY LIKE FOLDING LAUNDRY DOING DISHES TAKING OUT THE TRASH WITH AN IMMEDIATELY REWARDING ENJOYABLE ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE LISTENING TO YOUR FAVORITE POD CASTS WHICH ARE OF COURSE THE HUBORMEN LAV IN OUS LIGKE CHANGE OF PLANS OBVIOUSLY AH IT COULD BE LISTENING TO YOUR FAVORITE POP MUSIC BUT THE REALLY CRITICLE PIECE OF THE TEMPTATION BUNDLING IS THAT YOU HAVE TO FOREGO THE INDULGENCE OF ENJOYING THAT REWARDING ACTIVITY IN ALL OTHER SPACES OF YOUR LIFE SO FOR EXAMPLE A'M FOR ME I FEEL LIKE A GOOD POP SONG I HAVE LIKE TWENTY FIVE REALLY GOOD LISTENS AND THEN A KIND OF BECOMES OLD HAT SO THAT JUST LIKE YOU KNOW THE EXCITEMENT OF THE SONG WEARS WEARS OFF A BIT SO THERE'VE BEEN TIMES WERE ALL BE LIKE COOKING WITH MY HUSBAND AND HE'S LIKE HAY WHY DON'T WE PLAY AH YOU KNOW YOU LOVE CASEY MUST RAYS WHILE WE PLAY THAT ALVAM AND I'M LIKE NONENA NO THAT'S AT ALAM I CAN ONLY LISTEN TO WHEN I'M LIKE LIFTING WEIGHTS MANTAIN TE OUSEYET TO MAINTAIN THE BOTEN SEET RIGHT YOU DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO GET THE JOY AND EDIFICATION F THE HUBORMN LAG WHEN YOU'RE NOT TAKING A WALK AND GETTING EXPOSURE O THAT MORNING SUNLIGHT AND YOU KNOW IT'S SUCH A SIMPLE STRATEGY WHEN YO THINK ABOUT IT BUT I HAVE FOUND MYSELF LOOKING FORWARD TO REALLY ANNOYING TASS THAT I HAVE TO GET DONE BECAUSE I KNOW I'M GITGTO GET THE ENJOYMENT OF SOMETHING REALLY FUN THAT ACCOMPANIES IT E TASTIC IS IT IMPORTANT THAT THE THING THAT ONE ENJOYS BE DONE SIMULTANEOUSLY YE F LING LONDRY WHILE WATCHING THE A FLIX THING OR UM LISTENING TO A PARTICULAR PIECE OFMUSIC YET YOU WANT THEM TO COEXISTS BECAUSE THEN AGAIN YOU GET THAT IMMEDIATELYER MOST OF THE TIME THE THINGS THAT WE LAMENT DOING HAVE REALLY POSITIVE LONG TERMS OUTCOMES RIGHT IF I'M YOU KNOW IN THE HABIT OF KEEPING MY HOUSE CLEAN THERE'S LONG TER BENEFITS OF THE HABIT OF EXERCISING OR EATING HEALTHILY THERE'S LONGTURN BENEFITS BUT I DON'T OFTEN FEEL THE REWARDS IN REAL TIME SO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS GIVE YOURSELF THAT RUSH OF JOY AND EXCITEMENT THAT ACCOMPANIES THE IMMEDIATELY REWARDING ACTIVITY SO THAT IN YOUR MIND EVEN JUST LIKE NARROWLY THE TWO THINGS ARE COEXISTING WEL IT BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH FIRM GROUNDING IN THE ERBIALGY OF REWARD AND AVERSION AND HAW TO OVERCOME AVERSION UM THERE'S DEEP NUROU SIENC AROUND TESS BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD IT PRESENTED THAT WAY SO YE UM THANK YOU FOR THOSE INCREDIBLY CLEAR ANACTIONABLE A TOOLS FROMODIVATION BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLES STRUGGLE WITH THA YE AND I HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME AND I THINK YOU KNOT YOU TALKED ABOUT AVERSION AND ACTUAY THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT RETURNING TO OUR GOALS WHICH IS OFTEN THE HARD THANGS TO YOU DO IT ON E MONDAY AND YOU HAVE THAT SAME GOL ON A TUESDAY ANDTHEN ON A WEDESDAY ON THURSDAY AND BY THURSDAY YOUR KIND OF LIKE ON MY GOT IT WAS SO HARD THE FIRST FEW DAYS TOR REALLY WANT TO GO BACK AND DO THAT O DO THE SAME WORK OUT ON THE THURSDAY UM WHAT'S REALLY HELPFUL HERE TO AVOID SOME OF THAT AVERSION IS TO BE MINDFUL OF THE UM THE WAY IN WHICH OUR MINDS PROCESS MEMORY SO WHEN WE REFLECT BACK ON HOW MUCH WE ENJOYED OR DIDN'T ENJOY IN EXPERIENCE WE DON'T GIVE EQUAL WIGHT TO EVERY MOMENT EACH MOMEN DOESN'T GET UNIFORM WEIGHT INSTEAD WE TEND TO I'M GIVE MORE WEIGHT TO WHAT'S CALLED THE PIQUE OF THE EXPERIENCE SO THE EXPERIENCE THAT WAS MOST EMOTIONALLY INTENSE THE PART OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT WAS THE MOST E MOTIONALLY INTENSE AND THE END OF THE EXPERIENCE SO THIS IS A THIS IS WORKED ONE BY A NOBLE LAURIAT CONNAMEN A DANIEL CONNAMENN AND HIS CLABORATOR I MUSTVIRSKY SO THE PIQUE END RULE IS WHAT THIS IS CALLED SE YOU PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT ON AGAIN THAT REALLY EMOTIONALLY INTENSE MOMENT OF TH EXPERIENCE IN THE END NOW RESEARCHES HAVE STUDIED THIS IN THE CONTEXTS OF LOTS OF UNPLEASANT ACTIVITIES SO IN SOME STUDIES PEOPLE ARE ARE FORCE TO PLUNGE SUBMERGE THEIR HANDS AND LIKE ICE COLD WATER OR THEY LOOKED AT COLONOSOTIES FOR EXAMPLE HOW UNPLEASANT THOSE ARE AND AH WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT THIS IS SO INTERESTING SO I AM NIRTING AT A LITTLEFIXA I JUST LIKE THINK THAT THIS FIELD IS SO COOL O NEER NEVIN OWT IS IN JUST AT ALREADY IT IS ENCOURAGE THA SAY O  AST I HAVING A MOMENT IT COGITIVE SCIENCE A TOT THIS IS SUCH COAL RESEARTS WHAT THESE RESEARCHERS THAT IS SO CLEVER IF YOU A LONGGATE THE UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE B A COUPLE MINUTES LET'S SAY SO THE HANDS IN FREESING COLD ICE WATER OR THE COLONOSCOVY BUT YOU MAKE THOSE LAST FEW MINUTES OF THE UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE SLIGHTLY LESS UNPLEASANT THEN THE END OF THE EXPERIENCE WOULD OTHERWISE ADVINT RIGHT HAD YOU JUST ENDED THE COLONOS CO BE PROCEDURE AS PLANN HAD YOU JUST TAKEN A THE HANDS WRIT OUT THE OUTICE BUCKET BY FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER BY A DEGREE OR EASE YOUR IMAGINATIONS WHATEVER THEYS EHUUMAY E CALLIN US HERE WE LES THERE THERE THERE ARE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE PAIN CAN BE LESS FOSITION EVERYWHERE KNOW THEM BUT WE AT WHAT WE ARE WE HERBLIANDA UBUGISES COULD DO THE METAL WORK OF FIGURING OUT WITH THE ALONANDAL UGULOGICAL A WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT PEOPLE LOOK BACK ON THE EXPERIENCE MORE FAVORABLY THEYAVE A MORE POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF THE EXPERIENCE NOW AGAIN THIS IS WHAT SO MIRACULOUS ABOUT THIS FINDING THE OVERALL DURATION OF THE UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN EXTENDED THERE ARE MORE MINUTES OF OVERALL SUFFERING RIGHT BUT THE LAST FEW MINUTES ARE LESS BAD TAN THEY WULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE AND SO PEOPLE ARE THEY VIEW THE EXPERIENCE MORE FAVORABLY IN THE CASE THE COLONOSES OBIES THEY WERE ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO RETURN FOR FOLLOW AT VISITS FOR FOR THEIR ANNUAL CHECK UPS A AND SO WHAT IS THIS MEAN OF DAILY LIFE BUT WHAT IT CAN MEAN IS LET' SAY YOU ARE LIKE LITERALLY KILLING YOURSELF AT THE GEN OO CAT YOU HAVE THE HARDEST WORK OUT THAT YOU'VE EVER HAD TACK ON A FEW MINUTES TO THE END OF THE WORK OUT THAT OURE STILL UNPLEASANT SEE YOUR SO CODINNG CODING THAT AS BEING PART OF THE UNPLEASANT WORKING OUT EXPERIENCE BUT ARE LITTLE BIT LESS INTENSE AND LESS PAINFUL THEN THE WORK OUT AND WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT BE MORE LIKELY TO RETURN AND ACTUALLY DO THAT THE HARDWORK OUT CAN WE ALSO SAY OF SOMEBODY REALLY ENJOY THEIR TRAINING THAT THE OPPOSITE WOULD BE EFFECTIVE AS WELL THAT PERHAPS I THEY REALLY WANT TO PUSH IT HARD AT THE END BEGAUSE THAT SIS SENCATION THAT THEY PARTICULARLY ENJOY THAT THAT COULD SERVE PRSUNELY THE MEMORY SYSTEMS IN THE REWARD SYSTEMS OF THE BRAINS SUCH THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO RETURN TO THE WORK OUT ABSOLUTE YOU RAISE A FANTASTIC POINT WHICH IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ENJOYMENT IN THESE CONTACTS IT IS ALL SUBJECTID SO I ISH LO CIN TO LOVE THE FEELING LIKE AND WOULD A DIE BECAUSE MY HEART IS IT A RASINGS SOIN FOR EVER YOUS THAT IAVE JUST WIRE TO LOVE EXERCISES RIGHT AND ON I LOVE A HARDSFREND TRAIDING WORK OUT RIGHT AND SO FOR ME WHAT ENJOING MENT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AT THE END IS LIKE REALLY REALLY REALLY INTENSE RIGHT THAT MIGHT BE WHAT BRINGS ME BACK BUT IN OTHER DOMAINS ABSOLUTELY NOT LIKE COLONOSKETY'S SITUATION I DO NOT WANT THE TO BE AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE AND SO THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER DOMAINS IN LIFE WHERE HE JUST TACK ON A FEW OF THE FEW MINUTES ON TO SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY TEDIOUS ARE REALLY HARD OR REALLY PAINFUL IT CAN MAKE YOU MORE LIKELY TO CONMIT TO IT LATER BUT IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT IN ALL OF THESE STUDIES IT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER WHO THE PERSON IS AND WHAT THEIR NATURAL PSYCHOLOGY IS LIKEN FOR EVERYONE LISTENING YOU WANT A TAILOR THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON THERE CERTAIN LIFE DEMANDS THAT I FIND ENCREDIBLY AVERSITE SO I'M GOING TO USE THIS APPROACH FOR THOSE I'M ALSO GOING TO I USE THEM IN THE CONTECT OF THINGS I REALLY ENJOY BECAUSE AM IF ONE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO FURTHER REENFORCE THE THINGS THAT BRING USTOY WHY WHY WOULDN'T WE HAVE TOREALY O FANTASTIC RECOMMENDATIONS SO NI COULD ASK YOU A THOUSAND MORE QUESTION AND M I HOPE IS THAT YOU'LL COME BACK SO THAT I GAN OW YO THOSE THOUSAND PLUS MORE QUESTIONS I HAVE TO SAY IT IS EXCEEDINGLY RARE THAT I TALK TO SOMEBODY EITHER ON THE PODCAST OR ELSEWHERE FRANKLY IN MY LIFE THAT HAS SUCH A INCREDIBLY WHY BREADTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND YET HAS SO MUCH DEPTHS OF KNOWLEDGE AS WELL IT'S CLEAR THAT YOUR MANY EXPERIENCES THROUGH

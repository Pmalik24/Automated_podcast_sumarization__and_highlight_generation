WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAPONTENS NTIS A SCIENCE SCIENCE PASES TO  I AM INDRUHUBERMEN AND O'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS SALT ALSO REFER TO AS SODIUM MOST OF US THINK OF SALT AS SOMETHING THAT WE PUT ON IN IN OUR FOOD MAY BE SOMETHING TO AVOID MAY BE SOME OF YOU ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET MORE SALT SOME OF YOURE TYING TO GET LESS SALT WE ALL SEEM TO ASSOCIATE SALT WITH THINGS LIKE BLOOD PRESSURE AT CETERA TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN A DIFFERENT SET OF AVENUES RELATE TOD TO SALT WE WILL CERTAINLY COVER HOW SALT REGULATES BLOOD PRESSURE WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN REGULATES OUR APPETITE FOR SALT OR OUR AVERSION FOR SALT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW OUR SENSING OF SALTY TASTES ACTUALLY MEDIATES HOW MUCH SUGAR WE CRAVE AND WHETHER NOT WE INJEST MORE OR LESS SUGAR THAN WE ACTUALLY NEED WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN TO DAY IS THAT THE SO CALLED SALT SYSTEM MEANING THE SELLS AND CONNECTIONS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT MEDIATE SALT CRAVING AND AVOIDANCE OUR REGULATING MANY MANY ASPECTS OF OUR HEALTH AND OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM IN VARIOUS CONTECTS THINGS LIKE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE THINGS LIKE COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT AGING AND DOMENSIA AND AVOIDING AGING IN DEMENSIA AND WHAT ROLL SALT AND SALT AVOIDANCE MIGHT PLAY IN THAT WE ARE GOING TO TOUCH ON SOME THEMES THAT FOR SOME OF YOU MIGHT SEEM CONTROVERSIAL AND INDEED IF THEY ARE CONTROVERSAL I W'LL BE SURE TO HIGHLIGHT THEM AS SUCH I'M GEIN TO COVER A LOT OF NEW DATA THAT POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY I WON'T EMPHASIZE THE POSSIBILITY THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE MORE SALT MIGHT HELP THEM IN TERMS OF HEALTH COGNITIVE IN BODILY FUNCTIONING AND FOR OTHER PEOPLE LESS SALT IS GOING TO BE BETTER EM N TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE VARIOUS PERAMETERS ARE I'M NE GIVEIN SOME GUID LINES THAT IN CONCERT WITH YOU ARE PHYSICIAN WHO SHOULD ABSOLUTELY TALK TO BEFORE ADDING OR CHANGING ANYTHING TO YOUR DIET OR SUPPLEMENTATION RECUME CAN HELP YOU ARRIVE AT A SALT IN TAKE THAT'S GOING TO OPTIMIZE YOUR MENTAL PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE SO WEIN TO COVER NEURBIOLOGY WERE OING TO COVER HORMON BIOLOGY WERE IN TALK ABOUT LIVER FUNCTION WE'RE GOINGTO TALK ABOUT KIDNEY FUNCTION AND OF COURSE BRAIN FUNCTION I'M EXCITED TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU TO DAY I'M CERTAIN AGN COME AWAY WITH A LOT OF INFORMATIAN AND ACTIONABLE ITEMS BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THE TOPIC OF TO DAY'S EPISODE  ON A HIGH LIGHT OF REALLY EXCITING NEW STUDY THIS IS A STUDY FROM DIEGO BEHORSES SLAB AT DUKE UNIVERSITY THE MORES LAV STUDIES INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE GUT AND THE BRAIN AND HAS MADE SOME INCREDIBLE DISCOVERIES OF THESE SO CALLED NEUROPOD SELLS NEUROPOD CELLS AURE NURONS NERVE CELLS THAT RESIDE IN OUR GUT AND THAT DETECT THINGS LIKE FATYACIDS AND MENO ACIDS AND SOME NEUROPOD SELLS SENSE SUGAR PREVIOUS WORK FROM THIS LABORATORY HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN WE INJEST SUGAR THESE NEUROPOD SELLS RESPOND TO THAT SUGAR AND SEND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS UP A LOW WIRE THAT WE CALL AN ACTS ON THROUGH THE VAGUEST NER FOR THOSE WHO E THEY WANT TO KNOW AND INTO THE BRAIN AND THROUGH SUBSEQUENT STATIONS OF NERL PROCESSING EVOKE THE RELEASE OF DOPOMIE DOPOMINE IS A MOLECULE KNOWN TO PROMOTE CRAVING AND MOTIVATION AND INDEED ACTION AND WHAT THESE NEUROPOD CELLS THAT SENT SUGAR ARE THOUGHT TO DO IS TO PROMOTE SEEKING AND CONSUMPTION EATING OF MORE SUGARY FOODS NOW THE INCREDIBLE THING IS THAT IT'S ALL SUBCONSCIOUS THIS IS A TASTE SYSTEM IN THE GUT THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO YOUR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS NOW OF COURSE WHEN YOU INJUST SWEET FOODS YOU TASTE THEM ON YOUR MOUTH TOO AND SO PART OF THE REASON TAT YOU CRAVE SWEET FOODS PERHAPS IS BECAUSE THEY TASTE GOOD TO YOU AND THE OTHER REASON IS THAT THESE NEUROPOD CELLS ARE DRIVING A CHEMICAL CRAVING BELOW YOUR CONSCIOUS DETECTION SO THERE REALLY TWO SYSTEMS YOUR GUT IS SENSING AT A SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL WHAT'S IN IT AND SENDING SIGNALS TO YOUR BRAIN THAT WORK IN CONCERT IN PARALLEL WITH THE SIGNALS COMING FROM YOUR MOUTH AND YOUR ICPERIENCE OF THE TASTE OF THE FOOD NOW THAT ALONE IS INCREDIBLE AND HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MANY IMPORTANT LANDMARK PAPERS OVER THE LAST DECAT OR SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THE SYSTEM WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THINGS LIKE HIDDEN SUGARS WHEN NOWADAYS IN A LOT OF PROCESS FOODS THERE PUTTING HIDDN SUGARS I THEY'RE PUTTING A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAUSE YOUR GUT TO SEND SIGNALS TO YOUR BRAIN THAT MAKE YOU CRAVE MORE OF THOSE FOODS SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT REALLY LOVE SUGAR JUST UNDERSTAND ITS NOT JUST ABOUT HOW THAT SUGAR TASTES THE NEW STUDY FROM THE BORHES LAB DESERVES ATTENSION I BELIEVE THIS IS A PAPER PUBLISH JUST RECENTLY FEBRUARY TWENTY FIFTH THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN NATURE NEROL SCIENCE AND EXCELLENT JOURNAL AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS THE PREFERENCE FOR SUGAR OVER SWEETENER DEPENDS ON A GUT SENSE AR CELL THE BORER'S LAB IS NOW DISCOVERED A NEUROPOD CELL MEANING A CATEGORY OF NURONS THAT CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SWEET THINGS IN THE GUT THAT CONTAIN CALLORIES FOR INSTANCE SUGAR AND THINGS IN THE GUT THAT ARE SWEET BUT DO NOT CONTAIN CALORIES ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS LIKE ASPERTAIN SUCRELOS AND SO FORTH THERE ARE ALSO OF COURSE NONARTIFICIAL NON COLORIC SWEETENERS LIKE STEVIA MONFRUID ET CETERA THEY DID NOT EXPLORE THE FULL GALLERY OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS WHAT THEY DID FIND HOWEVER OUGHT TO PERTAIN TO ALL FORMS OF SWEET NON COLORIC SUBSTANCES WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WAS THAT THERE IS A SIGNATURE PATTERN OF SIGNALS SENT FROM THE GUT TO THE BRAIN WHEN WE INJEST ARTIFICIAL OR NONCOLORIC SWEETENERS THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT AT A SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL THE GUT CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SWEET THINGS THAT CONTAIN CALORIES AND SWEET THINGS THAT DO NOT NOW WHAT THE DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCES OF THIS THENSING IS OR WHAT THEY ARE ISN'T YET CLEAR NOW I BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THESE KINDS OF STUDIES FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS FIRST OF ALL ITS IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT YOU CRAVE MEANING THE FOOD YOU CRAVE IN THE DRINKS YOU CRA VE IS IN PART DUE TO YOUR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE OF THE TASTE OF THOSE THINGS BUT ALSO DUE TO BIO CHEMICAL AND NURAL EVENTS THAT START IN THE BODY AND INPINGE ON YOUR BRAIN AND CAUSE YOU TO SEEK OUT CERTAIN THINGS EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW WHY YOUR SEEKING OUT MORE SUGAR YOU FIND THEUR CRAVING A LOT OF SUGAR OR YOUR CRAVING A LOT OF FOODS WITH ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHY NOW ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THEMSELVES ARE A SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC I WANT TO HIGH LIKE THAT SOME MONTHS BACK I DESCRIBED O STUDY FROM YELE UNIVERSITY ABOUT HOW ONE CONCONDITION THE INSOLENT SYSTEM INSOLENT IS INVOLVED IN MOBILIZING A BLOOD SUGAR AND SO FORTH IN THE BODY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AND I DESCRIBE SOME STUDIES THAT WERE DONE FROM YELE UNIVERSIY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE LOOKING AT HOW ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS CAN ACTUALLY EVOKE AN INSOLENT RESPONSE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS NOW A COUPLE OF TEATHINGS I GOT A LA BIT OF PUSH BACK AFTER COVERING THUS STUDIES AND I ENCOURAGE PUSH BACK ALL THE TIME IT'S YOU KNOW PUSH BACK AS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT FORCES ALL OF US TO DRILL DEEPER INTO A TOPIC I WANT TO BE CLEAR FIRST OF ALL I AM NOT ONE TO DEMONIZE ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS THERE IS EVIDENCE IN ANIMAL MODELS IN ANIMAL MODELS THAT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS CAN DISTROP THE GOTMACROBAYOM BUT THOSE WERE FAIRLY HIGH DOSES OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS AND IT'S UNCLEAR OF THE SAME THING PERTAINS TO HUMANS STILL UNCLEAR I SHOULD SAY HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED THOROUGHLY SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE TASTE OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS SOME PEOPLE DO SOME PEOPLE FIND THAT THEY REALLY HELP THEM AVOID EXCESSIVE CLORIC AN TAKE SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE AND YET I SHOULD EMPHASIZED THEIR STILL ISN'T EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN ADJUST THE INSOLENT RESPONSE IN ALL PEOPLE A ISONE REPEET THAT THREE TIMES SO THAT A PEOPLE ARE CLEAR ON THAT FACT WHAT THESE NEW DATA EMPHASIZE HOWEVER IS THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AR CONSUMED AT THE LEVEL OF THE GUT OR I SHOULD SAY REGISTERED AT THE LEVEL OF THE GUT AND HOW THAT CHANGEIS BRAIN FUNCTION BECAUSE ONE THING THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH HEN THAT MANY PEOPLE REPORT IS THAT WHEN Y THEY FIRST TASTE ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS THEY TASTE SORT OF NOT RIGHT TO THEM THEY DON'T LIKE THE TASTE BUT OVERTIME THEY ACTUALLY START TO CRAVE THAT TASTE I'VE EXPERIENCE THIS I USED TO DRINK A LOT OF DIET SODAS WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL SO TO BE ASPERTAIN AND I FOUND THAT I WOULD NEAT I ACTUALLY NEEDED THEM NOW MAYBE WAS THE CAFFINE MAY BE I DISLIKE THE SWEET TASTE OF THE CARBONATION WE ACTUALLY HAVE  I A DRIVE FOR CARBONATION WHICH IS HE TOPIC OF A FUTURE EPISODE BUT WHEN I FINALLY QUIT THEM FOR REASONS THAT WERE INDEPENDENT OF ANY FEAR OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS I FOUND THAT I DIDN'T LIKE THE TASTE NOWADAYS I ONLY OCCASIONALLY DRINK A DIET SODA I USUALLY DO THAT FOMONA PLAIN AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AVAILABLE TO ME SO I DON'T DEMONIZE THEM I MIGHT A DRINK ONE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE NO BIG DEAL I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR I CONSUME STEVIA AN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT A SUPPLEMENTS AND FOODS THAT I CONSUME STEVIA OF COURSE IS A PLANT BASTE NON COLORIC SWEETNER SO I MYSELF CONSUME ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS MANY PEOPLE HATE THEM MANY PEOPLE LIKE THEM AND FIND THEM USEFUL FOR THEIR NUTRICION AND IN FACT TO KEEP THEIR CLOR CAN TAKE IN ARRANGE THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM AND MANY PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THEM AND SOMEWHAT WEARY OF THEM AND YET CONTINUE TO CONSUME THEM IN SMALL AMOUNTS I THINK MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT MANY FOOD MANUFACTURERS PUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS SUCH AS SUCROLOS ET CETERA INTO FOODS AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN UNCLEAR AS TO WHY THEY MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT AND YET WE KNOW THAT THE SWEET TASTE CONSUMPTION EVEN IF IT DOESN'T CONTAIN CALORIES CAN DRIVE MORE CRAVING OF SWEET FOOD SO THERE MAY BE A LOGIC OR A STRATEGY TO WHY THEY DO THAT AGAIN A TOPIC FOR EXPLORATION ON TO DAY'S PODCAST AND IN FUTURE PODCAST BECAUSE WHERE WERE HEADED TO DAY IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW SALT AND SALT SENSING BOTH CONSCIOUSLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY CAN ADJUST OUR CRAVING FOR OTHER THINGS LIKE SUGAR AND WATER AND SO ON SO I WANT A HIHLIKE THIS BEAUTIFUL WORK FROM THE BOREAS LAB WILL PUT A LINK TO THE STUDY I WANT TO OPEN THIS AS A CHAPTER FOR FURTHER EXPLORATION I LIKE TO THINK THAT THE LISTENERS IS OF THIS PODCAST ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS WHERE WE HAVE ANSWERS BUT ARE ALSO I WOULD HOPE EXCITED ABOUT SOME OF THE NEW AND EMERGING THEMES IN WHAT WE CALLED NUTRICIONAL NEUROBIOLOGY AND INDEED THE BOHORS LAB REALLY STANDS AS ONE OF THE PREMER LABORATORIES OUT THERE THAT'S LOOKING AT HOW FOODS AS CONSUMED IN THE GUT ARE MODIFYING OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THE FOODS WE CRAVE AND HOW WE UTILIZE THOSE FOODS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARAT FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCINES RELAT TE TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ATHLETIC GREENS LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OURE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUT MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK AM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER HE'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATAD NOW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT IN VITEMIND THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARTYVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIEFREY TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THREE K TO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NONE OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T THAT MEANS IT HAS SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM SO CALED ELECTROLITES WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR NORONAL FUNCTION AND A LOT OF OTHER BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AS I MENTION ON THE PODCAS BEFORE I'M A FAN OF SALT I BELIEVE IN INJESTING APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF SALT AND BY APPROPRIATE I MEAN DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND BLOOD PRESSURE HAPPENS TO BE WHAT YOUR ACTIVITY LEVELS ARE HOW MUCH YOU SWEAT WHAT YOUR COGNIVE AND PHYSICAL DEMANDS ARE TO DAY ORGAN A TALK ABOUT HOW TO DETERMINE WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO STAY ON TOP OF MY HYDRATION AND AS YOU'LL ALSO LEARN ABOUT TO DAY SALT AND WATER IN TAKE AND HYDRATION ARE INTIMATELY RELATED WITH ELEMENT I'M SURE TO GET THE POTASSIUM THE SODIUM AND THE MAGNESIUM THAT I NEED AND I DO THAT IN A GREAT TASTING DRINK AND AS I MENTION BEFORE IT HAS NO SUGAR IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT DOK CAM THAT DRINK EL M ND T DOC CM SLASH HUBERMAN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PAC YOU ONLY COVER THE COST OF SHIPPING OTHERWISE ITS COMPLETELY FREE AGAIND THAT' DRINK ELEMENT EL M ND T DOC CAM SLASH HUBERMAN TO CLAIM A FREE SAPLE PACK OF ELEMENT OKE LET'S TALK ABOUT SALT SALT HAS MANY MANY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN THE BRAIN AN BODY FOR INSTANCE IT REGULATES FLUID BALANCE HOW MUCH FLUID YOU DESIRE AND HOW MUCH FLUID YOU EXCREET IT ALSO REGULATES YOUR DESIRE FOR SALT IT SALF MEANING YOUR SALT APPETITE YOU HAVE A HOMEOSTATICALLY DRIVEN SALT APPETITE I'LL TALK ABOUT THE MECHANISMS TO DAY MAKE THEM ALL VERY CLEAR WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU CRAVE SALTY THINGS BEVERAGISM FOODS WHEN YOUR SALT STORES ARE LOW AND YOU TEND TO AVOID SALTY BEVERAGISM FOODS WHEN YOUR SALT STORES ARE HIGH ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU WILL CONTINUE TOCRAVE SALT EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T NEED SALT OR INDEED EVEN IF YOU NEED TO ELIMINATE SALT FROM YOUR SYSTEM SALT ALSO REGULATES YOUR APPETITE FOR OTHER NUTREANTS INGS LIKE SUGAR INGS LIKE CARBOHYDRATES AND TO DAY WILL EXPLORE ALL OF THAT TECHNICALLY SALT IS A MINERAL AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT WHEN I SAY SALT I AM INDEED REFERRING TO SODIUM IN MOST CASES ALTHOUGH I WILL BE CLEAR TO DISTINGUISH SALT FROM SODIA MEANING FOR TABLE SALT FROM SODIUM MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS BUT ONE GRAHAM OF TABLE SALT CONTAINS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILIGRAMS OF SODIUM SO TECHNICALLY WE SHOULD BE TALKING BOUT SODIUM TODAY AND NOT SALT I WILL USE THEM INTERCHANGEABLY UNLESS I'M REFERRING TO SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS OR IDEAS ABOUT TRYING TO DEFINE YOUR IDEAL SALT ACAE SODIUM INTAKE OCHASO THIS IS IMPORTANT I THINK RIGHT OFF THEBAT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THEMSELVES INTO A PLACE OF CONFUSION AND POTECH EVEN TO A PLACE OF TROUBLE BY THINKING THAT TABLE SALT IN GRAHAMS ALWAYS EQUATES TO SODIUM IN GRAHAMS IN THAT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE THE NURAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH WE REGULATE ARE SALT APPETITE AND THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN AN BODY INTERACT IN THE CONTEXT OF SALT SEEKING SALT AVOIDANCE HOW TO DETERMINE WHEN WE NEED MORE SALT WHEN WE NEED LESS SALT WELL TALK ABA KIDNEY FUNCTION WELGET INTO ALL OF IT AND WE'REGOING TO DO IT VERY SYSTEMATICALLY SO LET'S START IN THE BRAIN WE ALL HARBOR SMALL SETS OF NURONS WE CALL THESE SETS OF NURON'S NEUCLYI MEANING CLUSTERS OF NURONS THAT SINCE THE LEVELS OF SALT IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THERE ARE COUPLE BRAIN REGIONS THAT DO THIS AND THESE BRAIN REGIONS ARE VERY VERY SPECIAL SPECIAL BECAUSE THEY LACK BIOLOGICAL FENCES AROUND THEM THE OTHER BRAIN AREAS HAVE AND THE THOSE FENCES R ITIOUS A THAT FENCE GOES BY A PARTICULAR NAME AND THAT NAME IS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER OR B B B MOST SUBSTANCES THAT ARE CIRCULATING AROUND IN YOUR BODY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR LARGE MOLECULES CAN'T JUST PASS INTO THE BRAIN THE BRAIN IS A PRIVILEGED ORGAN IN THIS SENSE THERE A COUPLE O OTHER ORGANS THAT ARE PRIVILEGED AND THAT HAVE VERY STRICT BARRIERS VERY PARTICULAR FENCES IF YOU WILL THOSE OTHER ORGANS INCLUDE THNGS LIKE THE OVERIES AND TESTIES AND THAT MAKES SETS FOR THE FALLING REASON FIRST OF ALL THE BRAIN AT LEAST MOST OF THE BRAIN CANNOT REGENERATE AFTER INJURY YOU JUST SIMPLY CAN'T REPLACE BRAIN CELLS AFTER INJURY I KNOW PEOPLE GET REALLY EXCITED ABOUT NUROGENESISTS THE BIRTH OF NEW NURONS AND INDEED NURGENESIS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN ANIMAL MODELS AND TO SOME EXTENT IT EXISTS IN HUMANS IN A FEW PLACES FOR INSTANCE THE OFACTORY BULB WHERE NURONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETECTING ODERANTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR SMELL THAT IS AND IN THE LITTLE SUBREGION OF THE HYPPOCAMPUS OF MEMORY ARIA THERE'S PROBABLY SOME NUROGENESIS BUT THE BULK OF REALLY GOOD DATA OUT THERAE POINT TO THE FACT THAT IN HUMANS THERE'S NOT MUCH TURN OVER OF NURONS BWHUT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE NURONS YOU'RE BORN WITH ARE THE ONES THAT YOUR GOING TO BE USING MOST IF NOT ALL OF YOUR LIFE IN FACT YOU'RE BORN WITH MANY MORE NURONS THAN YOU'LL HAVE LATER AND THERE'S A PROCESS OF NATURALLY OCCURRING SELL DEATH CALLED A POPTOSIS THAT OCCURS DURING DEVELOPMENT SO YOU ACTUALLY ARE BORN WITH MANY MORE NURONS AN YOU HAVE LATER IN LIFE AND THAT'S THE REFLECTION OF A NORMAL HEALTHY PROCESS OF NERVE SELL ELIMINATION THE ESTIMATES VARY BUT ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW A THIRD TO MAY BE EVEN A HALF OR EVEN TWO THIRDS OF NURONS DEPENDING ON THE BRAIN ARRAGES CAN A TIE ACROSS DEVELOPMENT THETE MIGHT SOUND TERRIBLE BUT THAT'S ASHALLY ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU GO FROM BEING COUNT OF LIKE A OLD POTATO BUG FLOPPING AROUND HELPLESSLY IN YOUR CRIB TO BEING AN ORGANISM THAT CAN WALK AND TALK AND ARTICULATE AND A CALCULATE MATH OR DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING SO THE BRAIN HAS A SET OF ELEMENTS THESE NERVE CELLS AND OTHER CELLS AND IT NEEDS TO USE THOSE FOR THE ENTIRE LIFE SPAN SO HAVING A B B B A BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AROUND THE BRAIN IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THE OVERIES AND TESTES HAVE A BARRIER FOR WE ASSUME THE REASON THAT THEY CONTAIN THE GUNETIC MATERIAL BY WHICH WE CAN PASS O N ARGENES TO OUR OFFSPRING PROGENY MEANING MAKE CHILDREN AND THOSE CHILDREN WILL HAVE ORGENES AR AT LEAST HALF OF THEM THE OTHER HALF FROM THE PARTNER OF COURSE IF THE CELLS WITHIN THE OVERIES ANTESTES ARE MUTATED WELL THEN YOU CAN GET MUTATIONS AND OFFSPRINGS SO THAT'S VERY COSTLY IN THE EVOLUTIONARY SENS SO IT MAKESENS THAT YOUD HAVE A BARRIER FROM THE BLOOD SO IF YOU INJEST WHAT'S CALED THA MUTIGIN IF YOU INJUST SOMETHING THAT CAN MUTATE THE GENES OF OF CELLS EU CAN IMAGINE WHY THERE WOULD BE A PREMIUM ON NOT ALLOWING THOSE MUTIGENS TO GET INTO THE BRAIN THE OVERIES OF THE TESTIES  SO THE BRAIN HAS THIS BBBE THIS BLOOD BRING BARRIER AROUND IT WHICH MAKES IT VERY VERY HARD FOR SUBSTANCES TO PASS INTO THE BRAIN UNLESS THOSE SUBSTANCES ARE VERY SMALL OR THOSE SUBSTANCES AND MOLECULES A ARE CRITICALLY REQUIRED FOR BRAIN FUNCTION HOWEVER THERE ARE COUPLE OF REGIONS IN THE BRAIN THAT HAVE A FENCE AROUND THEM BUT THAT FENCEIS WEAKER CA IT SORT F LIKE GOING FROM A REALLY BIG WALL THICK A ELECTRONIC TWENTY FOUR HOURS SURVEILANCE FENCE WHERE NOTHING CAN PASS THROUGH EXCEPT ONLY THE EXCLUSIVE CARGO THAT'S ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH TO HAVING A LITTLE CYCLONE FENCE WITH A OCUPLE HOLES IN ET ARY  THAT KIND OF A PICKET FENSE THAT'S FALLING OVER AND SUBSTANCES CAN MOVE FREELY IN FROM THE BLOOD CIRCULATING IN THE BODY INTO THE BRAIN AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT MONITOR SALT BALANCE AND OTHER FEATURES OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE BODY AT THE LEVEL OF WHAT WE CALL OZMOLARITY AT THE CONCENTRATION OF SALT RESIDE IN THESE LITTLE SETS OF NURONS THAT SIT JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THESE WEAK FENCES AND THE MOST IMPORTANT AND FAMOUS OF THESE FOR TS SAKE OF TO DAYS CONVERSATION IS ONE CALLED OVI ELTI OVIELTY STANDS FOR THE ORGANUM VASCULOSUM OF THE LATERAL TERMINALIS HINT IS WHAT'S CALLED A CIRCUM VENTRICULAR ORGAN WHY CIRCUMVENTRICULAR WELL NOT TO BOG YOU DOWN WITH NEURANANOMY BUT YOUR BRAIN IS A BIG SQUISHY MASS OF NURONS AND OTHER SELTYPES BUT IT HAS TO BE NOURISHED AND THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THAT BRAIN THERE IS A TUBE THERE'S A HOLLOW THAT CREATE SPACES IN THOSE SPACES ARE CALLED VENTRICALS THE VENTRICLS ARE SPACES IN WHICH CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID CIRCULATES AND IT NOURISHES THE BRAIN IT DOES A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL THE CIRCUM VENTRICULAR ORGANS ARE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE NEAR THAT CIRCULATING FLUID AND THAT CIRCULATING FLUID HAS ACCESS TO THE BLOOD STREAM AN THE LOODSTREAM HAS ACCESS TO IT AND THE STRUCTURE THAT ARE REFERRING TO OVI ELTY ORGANOBASCULOSUME OF THE LATERAL TERMINALIS HAS NURONS THAT CONSENSE THE CONTHE CONTENTS OF THE BLOOD AND TO SOME EXTENT THE CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID THERE ARE COUPLE OTHER BRAINARIEAS THAT CAN DO THIS AS WELL THEY GO ALSO BY THE NAME OF CIRCUMVENTRICULAR ORGANS AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THE NAMES OF SOME OF THOSE OTHER AIRS BUT FOR TO DAY AND I THINK FOR SAKE OF MOST OF THE DISCUSSION UNDERSTAND THAT THE OVIALTY IS SPECIALS WHY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THIS THICK BARRIER FENCE WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A BAD THING AND YET IT'S A TERRIFIC BORDER DETECTOR THE NURONS IN THAT REGION ARE ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S PASSING THROUGH IN THE BLOODSTREAM AND CANDETECT FOR INSTANCE IF THE LEVELS OF SODIUM IN THE BLOOD STREAM OR TOO LOW IF THE LEVEL OF BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE BODY IS TOO LOWER TOO HIGH AND THEN THE OVIALTY CAN SEND SIGNALS TO OTHER BRAIN AREAS AND THEN THOSE OTHER BRAIN AREAS CAN DO THINGS LIKE RELEASE HORMONES THAT CAN GO AND ACT ON TISSUES IN WHAT WE CALL THE PARIPHERY IN THE BODY AND FOR INSTANCE HAVE THE KIDNEYS SECRET MORE URINE TO GET RID OF SALT THAT'S EXCESSIVE SALT IN THE BODY OR HAVE THE KINNES HOLD ON TO OURIN TO HOLD ON TO WHATEVER WATER OR FLUID THAT ONE MIGHT NEED SO BEFORE I GO ANY DEEPER INTO THIS PATHWAY JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE OVIALT HAS A VERY LIMITED BARRIER IT CAN DETECT THINGS IN THE BLOOD STREAM AND THIS INCREDIBLE AREA OF THE BRAIN ALMOST SINGLE HANDEDLY SETS OFF THE CASCADES OF THINGS THAT ALLOW YOU TO REGULATE YOUR SALT BALANCE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL NOT JUST FOR YOUR ABILITY TO THING CAN FOR YOUR NURANCE TO WORK BUT INDEED FOR ALL OF LIFE IF THE OVIALTY DOESN'T FUNCTION CORRECTLY OUR EFFECTIVELY DEAD OR DEAD SOON SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BRAIN REGION SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF THE OVIALTE AND FLESH OUT SOME OF THE OTHER ASPECTS OF ITS CIRCUITRY OF ITS COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER BRAIN AREAS AND WITH THE BODY IN THE CONTICTS OF SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH WHICH IS THIRST AV YOUR WONDER JUST WHY YOU GET THIRSTY WELL IT'S BECAUSE NURONS IN YOUR OVIAL TE ARE DETECTING CHANGES IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM WHICH DETECT GLOBAL CHANGES WITHIN YOUR BODY AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT YOUR OVIALTY SETS OFF CERTAIN EVENTS WITHIN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT MAKE YOU EITHER WANT TO DRINK MORE FLUID OR TO STOP DRINKING FLUID THEIR TWO MAIN KINDS OF THIRST THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED OSMODIC THIRST AND THE SECOND IS CALLED HYPO VOLEMIC THIRST OSMODIC THIRST HAS TO DO WITH HE CONCENTRATION OF SALT IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM SO LET' SAY YOU INJEST SOMETHING VERY VERY SALTY LET SAY YOU INJEST IU KNOW A BIG BAG OF I ID CONFESS AN ON EAT THESE VERY OFTEN BUT I REALLY LIKE THOSE KETTLE POTATOCHIPS AND THEIR PRETTY SALTY OUT OF NEVER ACTUALLY MEASURED HOW MUCH SODIUMIS IN THEM SURE THE INFORMATIONS HARE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE FROM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN DOING SO I'LL JUST DOWN ABAG OF THOSE THINGS AND I REALLY LIKE THEM IN THEIR VERY SALTY BUT THEY ALMOST ALWAYS MAKE ME FEEL THIRSTY AND THE REASON IS THAT BY EATING THOSE I'VE INJESTED A LOT OF SODIA AGAIN NOT A FREQUENT OCCURRENCE FOR ME BUT HAPPENS EVERY NOW AND AGAIN AND I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH SHAME ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THING I HAVE A PRETTY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP TO FOOD AND I ENJOY THEM AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL DRIVE SALT LEVELS UP IN MY BLOOD STREAM AND THAT WILL CAUSE ME TO BE THIRSTY BUT WHY WHY BECAUSE NURONS IN THE OVIALTY COME IN TO MAIN VARIETIES ONE VARIETY SENSES THE OSMALARITY OF THE BLOOD THAT GETTING ACROSS THAT WEAK LITTLE FENCE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND WHEN THE OSMILARITY MEANING THE SALT CONCENTRATION THE BLOOD IS HIGH IT ACTIVATES THE SPECIFIC NURONS IN THE OVIALTI AND BY ACTIVATES I MEAN IT CAUSES THEM TO SEND ELECTRICAL POTENTIALS LITERALLY SEND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO OTHER BRAINAREAS AND THOSE OTHER BRAINAREAS INSPIRE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DOWNSTREAM EVENTS TO WHAT ARE THOSE OTHER BRIN AREAS WILE THE OVIALTI SIGNALS TO AN AREA CALLED THE SUPEROPTIC NUCLEUS THE NAME AND WHY ITS CALLE THE SUPEROPTAN NUCLEUS IS NOT NECESSARILY IMPORTANT IT ALSO SIGNALS TO THE SO CALED PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS ANOTHER NUCLEUS THAT SITS NEAR THE VENTRICALS AND COMMONITER THE QUALITIES THE CHEMICAL QUALITIES OF THE SREBROSPINAL FLUID AS WELL AS PROBABLY THE BLOOD STREAM IS WELL AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE THAT COMMUNICATION IS THAT A PARTICULAR HORMON IS EVENTUALLY RELEASED FROM THE POSTERIOR PETUITARY NOW THE PETUITARY IS A GLAND THAT SITS NEAR THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH IT RELEASES ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE GROWTH HORMON AND LUTINIZING HORMON LUTINIZING HORMON WILL STIMULATE THINGS LIKE ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON APRODUCTION AND RELEASE FROM THE OVERIESANTESTES AND SO ON THE PETUITARY HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT COMPARTMENTS AND FUNCTIONS BUT WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT THE PETUITRY IS THAT CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE PETUITARY ACTUALLY CONTAINED THE ACTS ONS THE WIRES OF NURONS AND THE NURONS RESIDE IN THE BRAIN AND SO THE SUPEROPTIC NUCLEUS GETS A SIGNAL FROM THE OVIALTE THE SIGNAL IS PURELY IN THE FORM OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY REMEMBER NURONS AREN'T TALKING IN ONE ANOTHER ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE THNOT SAYING STAY THERE'S YOU KNOW TOO MUCH SALT IN THE BLOOD STREAM LHAT'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ALL THEY RECEIVE ARE ARE SO CALLED ACTION PEDENTIAL WAVES OFELECTRICITY THE NURONS IN THE SUPEROPTIC NUCLEUS THEN RELEASE THEIR OWN ELECTRICAL SIGNALS WITHIN THE PETUITARY AND SOME OF THOSE NURONS AND NEAR BY NURONS ARE CAPABLE OF RELEASING HORMONS AS WELL AS ELECTRICAL SIGNALS SO FROM THE PRUTUITARY THERE'S A HORMONAL SIGNAL THAT'S RELEASE CALLED VAZOPRESSIN VESOPRESSAN ALSO GOES BY THE NAME ANTIDIARATIC HORMON AND ANTIDIRETIC HORMON HAS THE CAPACITY TO EITHER RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF URINE THAT WE SECRETE OR WHEN THAT SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF URONE THAT WE SECRETE SO THERE'S A COMPLICATED SET OF CASCADES THAT'S EVOKED BY HAVING HIGH SALT CONCENTRATION IN THE BLOOD THERE'S ALSO COMPLICATED SED OF CASCADES THAT ARE EVOKED BY HAVING LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF SODIUM IN THE BLOOD BUT THE PATHWAY IS NONE THE LESS THE SAME IT'S OVIALTI IS DETECTING THOSE OSMILARITY CHANGES COMMUNICATING TO THE SUPEROPTIC INCLEAS SUPEROTIC NULES IS EITHER CAUSING THE RELEASE OF OR IS RELEASING TES OPPRESS AND ANTIDAERATIC HORMON OR THAT SYSTEM IS SHUT OFF SO THAT THE ANTYDIARETIC HORMON IS NOT SECRETED WHICH WOULD ALLOW URIN TO FLOW MORE FREELY RIPE ANTITERETIC MEANS ANTI RELEASE OF URINE AND BY SHUTTING THAT OFF YOU ARE GOING TO CAUSE THE RELEAE OF URINE YOUR SORT OF ALLOWING A SYSTEM TO FLOW SO TO SPEAK THE SECOND CATEGORY OF THIRST IS HYPOVOLEMIC THIRST HYPOVOLEMIC THIRST OCCURS WHEN THEREIS A DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE OCH SO THE OVIAL TA AS I MENTION BEFORE CONSENTS OSMOLARITY BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT HAS THESE NURONS THAT CAN DETECT HOW MUCH SAULT IS IN THE BLOODSTREAM BUT THE OVALTY ALSO HARBORS NERONS THAT ARE OF THE BARRO RECEPTOR MECHANO RECEPTOR CATEGORY NOW MORE ON BARRO RECEPTORS AND MECHANO RECEPTORS LATER BUT BARRO RECEPTORS ARE ESSENTIALLY A RECEPTER A MEANING A PROTINE THAT IN A CELL THAT RESPONDS TO CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE SO THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE DECREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU LOSE A LOT OF BLOOD RIHT IF YOUR BLEEDING QUITE A LOT OR IN SOME CASES IF YOU VOMIT QUITE A LOT OR IF YOU HAVE EXTENSIVE DIARHOEA OR ANY COMMINATION OF THOSE AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN REDUCE BLOOD VOLUME AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE LATER BUT IN THE CLASSIC CASE OF HYPOVOLEMIC THIRST ONE IS SIMPLY LOSING BLOOD AND THEREFORE BLOOD PRESSURE GOES DOWN O VERY SIMPLE THE TO IMAGINE YOUR MONUE OF THESE PYPES WHICH ARE THE ARTERIES VEINS AND CAPLARIES AND WHEN YOU LOSE SOME BLOOD VOLUME THE PRESSURE IN THOSE ARTERIES VEINS AN CAPULARIES GOES DOWN OVIAL T HAS NURONS THAT CONSENTS THAT REDUCTION IN BLOOD PRESSURE BECAUSE OFTHE REDUCT BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF BARRER RECEPTORS IN OVIALTY THEREARE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ALSO PLAY IN TO THE RESPONSE TO WHAT WE CALL HYPOVOLEMIC THIRST FOR INSTANCE THE KIDNY WILL SECRETE SOMETHING CALLED RENIN RENNIN WILL ACTIVATE SOMETHING CALLED ANGIOTENSIN TO FROM THE LUNGS OF ALL THINGS AMAZING AN ANGIOTENDS INTO ITSELF CAN ACT ON OVIALT ORGANOBASCLOS ON THELATERAL TERMINALS WHICH IN TURN WILL CREATE THIRST OCHA SO IN BOTH CASES RIGTE THE OSMOLARITY SENSING SYSTEM MEANING OSMODIC THIRST AND IN HYPOVOLEMIC THIRST WHERE BLOOD PRESSURE HAS DROPPED THE END RESULT IS A DESIRE TO DRINK MORE AND THAT DESIRE TO DRINK MORE COMES TO A VARIETY OF PATHWAYS THAT ARE BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT INCLUDE VESA PRESSENT AND DON'T INCLUDE VESA PRESSENT BUT I THINK FOR JUST SAKE OF GENERAL EXAMPLE AND EVEN FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T HAVE ANY BIOLOGY BACKGROUND OF PHYSIOLOGY BACKGROUND JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR TWO MAIN TYPES OF THIRST BOTH TYPES OF THIRST OSM OSMODIC THIRST AND HYPOVOLEMIC THIRST ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SEEKING WATER BUT THEY ALSO ARE ABOUT SEEKING SALT IN VERY GENERAL TERMS SALT A CASSODIUM CAN HELP RETAIN WATER NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SALT ALWAYS RETAINS WATER IF YOU HAVE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF SALT WHILL YOU RETAIN EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF WATER WELL SORT OF AS WILL SOON LEARN IT'S ALT CONTEXTUAL BUT FOR MOST CASES WE CAN SAY THAT BY HAVING SALT IN OUR SYSTEM OUR BRAIN IN OUR BODY CAN FUNCTION NORMALLY PROVIDED THE LEVELS OF SALT ARE ADEQUATE AND NOT TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW AND THIRST WHILE WE OFTEN THINK OF IT IS JUST A WAY TO BRING FLUID INTO OUR BODY IS DESIGN AS A KIND OF A IN TERRECEPTIVE PERCEPTION WHAT I MEAN BY THAT AND TERRECEPTION AS MANY OF YOU KNOW NOW FROM LESSING THIS PODCAS IS A PAYING OF ATTENTION OR OR A RECOGNITION RATHER A CONSCIOUS RECOGNITION OFE THE EVENTS GOING ON WITHIN OUR BODY SO WHEN WE ARE THIRSTY IT'S A CERTAIN FORM OF INTERRECEPTION WE OWE I I NEED SOMETHING OR I CRAVE SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED BUT WHEN YOU ARE THIRSTY YOUARE NOT JUST SEEKING WATER YOUR ALSO SEEKING TO BALANCE YOUR OSMOLARITY WHICH MEANS YOU MAY BE SEEKING SALTY FLUIDS OR FOODS IN SOME CASES YOU'LL TRY NG TO COMPLISH US BY EATING OR IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID OR YOU WILL BE INSPIRED TO AVOID SALTY FLUIDS AND FOODS BUT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND SODIUM AND ITS ROLLS IN THE BODY YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIRST AND IF YOU WANT UNDERSTAND THIRST YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW FLUID BALANCE IS REGULATING THE BODY THAT'S NOT SURPRISING IT ALL BUT SODIUM AND WATER WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO GENERATE WHAT WE CALL THIR SODIUM WATER WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO EITHER RETAIN WATER OR INSPIRE US TO LET GO OF WATER TO URINITE SO BEFORE WE CAN DIVE INTO THE SPECIFIC SURROUND SALT AND HOW TO USALT FOR PERFORMANCE AND VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS AND THINGS TO AVOID WE NEED TO DRILL LITTLE BUT DEEPER INTO THIS FLUID BALANCE MECHANISM IN THE BODY AND FOR THAT REASON WE HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION TO THE KIDNEY THE KIDNEY IS AN INCREDIBLE ORGAN AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT INNEY IS SO AMAZING IS THAT IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH RETAINING HOLDING ON TO OR ALLOWING THE RELEASE OF VARIOUS SUBSTANCES FROM THE BODY SUBSTANCES LIKE GLUCOS OR MENO ACIDS YOUREA YEURIC ACID SALT POTASCIUM MAGNESIUM IT'S BASICALLY A FILTER BUT IT'S A VERY VERY INTELLIGENT FILTER IINTELLIGENT MEANING IT DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN MIND BUT THE WAY IT WORKS IS IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL BASICALLY BLOOD ENTERS THE KIDNEY AND IT GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF TUBES WHICH ARE ARRANGED INTO LOOPS IF YOU WANT TO LOOK MORE INTO THIS THERES THE THE BEAUTIFUL LOOP OF HENLEA AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE KIDNEY DESIGN THAT ALLOW CERTAIN SUBSTANCES TO BE RETAINED AN OTHER SUBSTANCES TO BE RELEASED DEPENDING ON HOW CONSTAN TRATED THOSE SUBSTANCES ARE IN THE BLOOD THE KIDNEY RESPONDS TO A NUMBER OF HORMONAL SIGNALS INCLUDING VESOPRESSON IN ORDER TO FOR INSTANCE ANTIDIRATICORMON IN ORDER TO HOLD ON TO MORE FLUID IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY NEED AND IT RESPONDS TO OTHER HORMONAL SIGNALS AS WELL SO IT'S A PRETTY COMPLEX ORGAN NONE THE LESS THERE'S A KEY POINT WHICH I ALREADY MENTIOND THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THIS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT I LIKE TO TELL KIDS WHEN I MEET THEM PROVIDED THAT THERE AF APPROPRIATE AGE I'LL SAY A HEOFTENTIMES IF IT KIDS LEARN I'M A SCIENTIST THE'LL THE LASKA HE QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING RELATE THO SCIENCE AND HOPEFULLY FOR MY SAKE GET SOMETHING ABUT NURRO SCIENCE A BUT ONE THING THAT I'LL TELL KIDS I'LL SAY YOU KNOW DO YOU KNOW THAT YUR OUR URINE YOUR PE IS ACTUALLY FILTERED BLOOD AND OCCASIONALLY THAT WILL REALLY TERRIFY A KID BUT ON THAT ALSO OCCASIONALY REALLY TERRIFIES AN ADULT ABUT INDEED YOUR URN IS FILTERED BLOOD ITS SE BLOOD GETS INTO THE KIDNEY THE KIDNEYS CAN A FILTER OUT CERTAIN THINGS CERTAIN THINGS R CAN BE ALLOWED TO PASS THROUGH AND OTHERS ARE NOT Q SO THE WAY THE KIDNEY IS DESIGNED IS THAT ABOUT NINETY PER CENT OF THE STUFF THAT'S ABSORBED FROM THE BLOOD IS GOING TO BE ABSORBED EARLY IN THIS SERIES OF TUBES AND ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGES GOING TO BE REGULATED OR WORKED OUT AS YOU GET INTO WHAT'S CALLED THE DISTAL KIDNEY DISTALL JUST MEANS THE FURTH THE FURTHEST PART AWAY OQ THE PROXIMAL IS UP CLOSE I'M SO LIKE YOUR SHOULDER IS PROXIMAL TO YOUR MIDLINE OF YOUR BODY AND YOUR HAND IS DISTAL SO IN BIOLOGICAL TRM TO HEAR ABOUT PROXIMAL DISTAL WHICH ODUCE MEANS NEAR OR FAR FROM SOJUST TO GIVE A REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE LET' SAY THAT YOU ARE VERY LOW ON FLUID YOU HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TO DRINK IN A WHILE MABE YOUR WALKING ROUND ON A HOT DAY CHANCES ARE THAT THE NURONS IN YOUR OVI L T WILL SENSE THE INCREASE IN OSMILARITY RIGHT THE CONCENTRATION OF SALT IS GOING TO BE INCREASED RELATIVE TO THE FLUID VOLUME THAT'S CIRCULATING THIS OF COURSE ASSUMES THAT YOU HAVEN'T EXCREETED A LOT OF SODIUM FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER BUT THAT INCREASE IN OSMILARITIES DETECTED BY THE OVLT THE OVLT IS GOING TO SIGNAL A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CASKADES THROUGH THE SUPEROPTECT INCLEATS ET CETERA AND THEN VEZO PRESSIN IS GOING TO BE RELEASED INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND VEZA PRESSON AGAIN ALSO CALLED ANTITIARETIC HORMON IS GOING TO ACT ON THE KIDNEY AND CHANGE THE KIDNEYS FUNCTION IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS SOME MECHANICAL SOME CHEMICAL OQ IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR KIDNEY DOES NOT RELEASE MUCH WATER DOESN'T MAKE YOU WANT TO YEUR IN ATE AND IN FACT EVEN IF YOU WOULD TRY TO YEUR IN ATE YOUR BODIES GOIN A TEND TO HOLD ON TO ITS FLUID STORES IT'S A VERY SIMPLE STRAIGHT FOR IT EXAMPLE WE CAN ALSO GIVE THE OTHER EXAMPLE WHEREBY IF YOU ARE INJESTING A LOT A LOT A LOT OF WATER AND IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY HOT DAY NOR NOT SWEATING VERY MUCH MUST ASSUME YOUR SALTAN TAKE IS CONSTANTORS OR IS LOW FOR WHATEVER REASON WELL THEN THE OSMOLARITY THE SAL CONCENTRATION IN YOUR BLOOD IS GOING TO BE LOWER YOUR OVIALTE WILL DETECT THAT BECAUSE OF THESE OZMO SIN SING NURONT IN YOUROVIALTE YOUR OVIALTEE WILL FAIL TO SIGNAL TO THE SUPEROPTIC NUCLEUS AND THERE WILL NOT BE THE RELEASE OF VESOPPRESSIN ANTIDERETIC HORMON AND YOU CAN EXCRET A ALL THE WATER THAT O YOUR BODY WANTS TO EXTRET MEANING YOU'LL BE ABLE TO URINATE THERE'S NO HOLDING ON TO WATER AT THE LEVEL OF THE KIDNEY I GET VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLES BUT HOPEFULLY TO ILLUSTRATES HOW EVENTS WITHIN THE BLOOD MEANING THE CONCENTRATION OF SALT RELATIVE THAT THE AMOUNT OF FLUID RIT THAT'S WHAT OSMOLARITY IS IS DETECTED BY THE OVIALTE THE BRAIN THEN COMMUNICATES TO THE PETUITARY THE PATUITARY SENDS A HORMONE OUT IN THE BLOOD AND THE HORMON ACTS ON THE KIDNEY TO EITHER HOLD ON TO OR LET GO OF FLUID MEANING TO PREVENT YOU FROM WANTING TO URINATE OR FROM STIMULATING YOU TO WANT TO URINETE VERY VERY SIMPLE KIND OF YES NO TYPE SITUATION HERE THERE'S A LOT OF NUANTS TO THIS IN REALITY THEIR A LOT OF OTHER HORMONS IN HIS PATHWAY BUT I THINK FOR LEAST THE STAGE OF THE DISCUSSION THIS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT A MOLECULE WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT TO DAY VESOPPRESSIN WAS ALSO MENTIONE ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE OF THE HUBROANE LADPOD CAS BUT IN A VERY DIFFERENT CONTEXT MOLECUE ON REFERRING TO HIS VESOPPRESSIN AND MENTION IT'S A HORMON INVOLVED IN ANTI DIORESIS MEANING PREVENTING URINATION IT'S AN ANTIDIARETIC BUT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT TES OPPRESSING IN TE CONTET OF DESIRE LOVE AND ATTACHMENT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE CONTET OF MONOGAMY AND NONMONOGAMY IN A SPECIES OF ANIMAL CALLED THE PRAIRIEVOL YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT  THAT EPISODE I BELIEVE A VESOPPRESSIN AND THE NONMONOGAMIS A PRAIRIE VOLS ARE A MENTIONED IN THE TIMESTAMPS OR SHOULD BE EASY TO FINE TES OPPRESSIN IS MADE AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAINLY THE SUPEROPTIC NUCLEUS AND INDEED IT'S ALSO INVOLVED IN ASPECTS OF SECTUAL BEHAVIOR AND MADING NOW IT DOES THAT THROUGH MECHANISMS THAT ARE DISTINCT FROM IT'S ANTIDIRETIC EFFECTS IN FACT THERE ARE PEOPLE AND WHO TAKE VESOPPRESSIN AS AN APHRODESIAC NOW I'M CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING PEOPLE DO THAT BUT I AVE ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD THAT THE MOMENT I TALK ABOUT VESOPPRESSIND SOME ONE IN THE COMMENS AS CAN SAY WHAT D YOU THINK ABOUT VESOPPRESSIN NASAL SPRAYS IN THIS KOND OFTHING ESOPRESSIN END INDEED OXY TOSIN ANOTHER A HORMON THAT'S INVOLVED IN PERABONDING AND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF BRAIN ANDBODY FUNCTION ARE AVAILABLE AS A NASAL SPRAYS AH THAT CAN GET UP INTO THE DEEP RECESSES OF THE BRAIN AND CAN IMPACT SOME OF THESE COR WHAT WE CALL HYPOTHALAMIC FUNCTIONS THESE PRIMITIVE DRIVES AND HYPOTHLAMIC FUNCTIONS I WOULD ENCOURAGE A LOT OF CAUTION ON MAY BE EVEN EXTREME CAUTION IN RECREATIONAL USE OF THINGS LIKE VESOPRESSIN AND OXYTOSIN LESS YOU ARE WORKING WITH EMDY AND EMDY ESCUSE ME AND THEY PRESCRIBE ETER THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THESE ARE POWERFUL HORMONES THAT HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND BODY THE WAY THAT THEYS OPPRESSEN MEANING ANTIDIARRETIC HORMONE PREVENTS THE RELEASE OF FLUID AS URINE FROM THE BODY IS PRETTY INTERESTING IT ACTS DIRECTLY ON THE KIDNEY SO AS I MENTION BEFORE BLOOD FLOWS INTO THE KIDNEY A NUMBER OF THINGS ARE RETAINED IN THE EARLY PART OF THE IDNEY THEYS OPPRESSIN ACTS AT A FAIRLY DISTAL MEANING N OUM AND AND GAME A PART OF THE OF THE LOOPS OF TUBES THROUGH THE KIDNEY AND IT INCREASES THE PERMEABILITY OF THOSE TUBES IN OTHER WORDS IT MAKE SURE THAT THE FLUID THAT WOULD OTHERWISE PASS INTO A COLLECTING DUCT AN THAN GO OUT TO THE BLATTER NEVER ACTUALLY MAKES IT TO THE BLADER I POINT THIS OUT BECAUSE WHAT ANTIDIARETIC FORMONE DOES AS IT PREVENTS THE BLATTER FROM FILLING AT ALL IT'S NOT AS IF IT LOCKS FLUID IN THE BLATTER AND PREVENTS YOU FROM URINATING I THINK THE WAY IVE BEEN DESCRIBING THE GS UP UNTIL NOW THE WAY YOU'LL HEREABOUT ANTIDIARETIC HORMENT MIGHT SOUND LIKE IT AND A LOCKS UP THE BLADTER PREVENTS YOU FROM BEING ABLE THE URINATE BE HOVE A FULL BLADTTER THAT'LL BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS IT ACTUALLY CAUSES THE TUBES HEADED TOWARDS THE BLATTER FROM THE KIDNEY TO BECOME PERMIABLE MEANING TO A LOW FLUID TO GO BACK INTO THE BLOOD STREAM INTO THE REST OF THE BODY SO THAT FLUID NEVER ACTUALLY FILLS THE BLATTER ANSO YOU NEVER FEEL THE URGE TO URINATE NOW THIS IS AN EPISODE ABOUT SALT A KEYTHING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE KIDNEY IS THAT THE KIDNEY USES SODIUM IN ORDER TO CONSERVE WATER WHICH HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT SODIUM CAN ACTUALLY HOLD WATER PUT DIFFERENTLY WATER TENDS TO FOLLOW SODIUM SO WHERE WE HAVE SODIUM WE TEND TO HAVE WATER AND SODIUM WHEN IT'S CONCENTRATED CAN HOLD ON TO WATER AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS THAT THE KIDNEY HOLDS ON TO WATER IN THE BODY AND AS WILL SOON LEARN IT IS THERE IS NO SIMPLE AND DIRECT FORMULA TO SAY FOR INSTANCE OKAY IF SALT LEVELS ARE HIGH A LOT OF WATER IS RETAINED AND IF SALT LEVELS ARE LOW A LOT OF WATER IS RELEASED ON THE ONE HAND THAT KAN BE TRUE BUT IT'S ALSO THE CASE BECAUSE THESE SYSTEMS ARE HOMEOSTATIC MEANING THAT ALWAYS SEEKING BALANCE BOTH WITHIN SYSTEM WITHIN THE SALT SYSTEM AND BETWEEN SYSTEMS THE SALT AND WATER SYSTEM IT'S ALSO THE CASE OFTEN THAT IF WE HAVE ENOUGH SODIUM WELL THEN WE CAN SECRETE SODIUM AND SOME WATER WILL FOLLOW OR IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SODIUM THEND YES INDEED BECAUSE WE'RE NOT HOLDING ON TO WATER MORE FLUID CAN BE EXCRETED BUT IF THAT CONDITION OF LOSODIUM LASTS LONG ENOUGH THAN WE START TO RETAIN WATER BECAUSE THE BODY RECOGNIZES AH SALT IS LOW AND WATERIS BEING EXCRETED AND EVENTUALLY A SYSTEM WILL KICK IN TO RETAIN WATER SO I'D LOVE TO GIVE YOU A SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE YES OR NO ANSER FOR LOSODIUM HIGHSODIUM MOTERATE SODIUM AND WATER BALANCE BUT IT'S ALL CONTEXTUAL ND WHEN I SAY CONTEXTRUAL I MEAN IT WILL DEPEND ON BLOOD PRESSURE HYGH PROTENSION PREHY PROTENSION IF THAT'S THERE MAY BE NORMAL TENSION HORMON LEVELS EXERCISE ET CETERA ET CETERA A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW COMPLICATED THIS CONNOLBY IS ONE THAT SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH IT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN THAT DURING CERTAIN PHASES OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHEN ESTEROGEN AND PROGESTERONE AND OTHER HORMONES ARE FLUCTUATING THAT WATER CAN BE RETAINED IN THE BODY THERE'S IT'S WHAT'S CALLED EDIMAR OR A SWELLING SOMETIMES SO THE THE COMMON ASSUMPTION AND INDEED IT CAN BE TRUE THAT WHEN ESTEROGEN LEVELS ARE HIGH THERE'S WATER RETENSION IN THE BODY ALSO IN MALS IF ESTEROGEN LEVELS ARE HIGH THERE CAN BE WATER RETENSION THE BODY THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY A ATHLEDES AND IN PRETYLAR BODY BUILDERS WHO TAKE ANABOLIC STEROIDS LIKE TESTOCTEROM WHICH CAN BE CONVERTED INTO ESTEROGENS SOMETIMES THEY'LL LOOK THEY'L WALK AROUND THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WERE PARTIALLY INFLATED THEY LOOK LIKE THEYRE GEN A POP AND ITS IN ITS IT LOOKS LIKE A SWELLING OF THE SKIN NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE LARGE MUSCLES AND THATS NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN WATER RETENSION DU TO TESTOSTERONE CONVERSION INTO ESTROGEN NOW THAT ALL SOUNDS CONSISTENT RIGHT ESTEROGEN LEVELS FLUCTUATED IN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IN MAILS WHERE THERE'S AN INCREASE IN ESTEROGEN THERE'S PRETENSION OF WATER BUT ACTUALLY ESTROGEN ACTS AS A DIARATIC SO ONE WOULD THINK OCATE WHEN ESTROGEN LEVELS GO UP THERE SHOULD BE A LOT OF FLUID EXCRETED BUT I BRING UP THIS EXAMPLE TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED IN DYNAMIC BALANCE BETWEEN HORMONES AND SALT AND FLUID YOU CAN'T DRAW ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP THERE AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND WE CAN USE THAT NOT AS A WAY TO FURTHER COMPLICATE THINGS BUT IS AWAY TO UNDERSTAND UNDER WHICH CONTECTS LESS SO DO YOU MEN TAKE OR MORE SO DO YOU MEN TAKE CAN BE BENEFICIAL SO THAT'SWHAW I LIKE TO TURN OUR ITTENSION NOW SO HOW MUCH SALT DO WE NEED AND WHAT CAN WE TRUST IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GUIDE OUR INGESTION OF SALT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAVE PREHY PROTENSION OR HYGH PRETENSION YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE PREHY PROTENSION OR HYG PROTENSION YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE NORMAL TENSION MEANING NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE EVERY ONE SHOULD KNOW THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE THE ABSOLLY CRUCIAL MEASUREMENT THAT HAS A LOT OF IMPACT ON YOUR IMMEDIATE LONGTERN HEALTH OUT COMES IT INFORMS A LOT ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO SHOULD YOU BE DOING MORE CARTOR OF ASCULAR EXERCISE SHOULD YOU BE INJUSTING MORE OR LESS SALT SHOULD YOU BE ADJUSTING ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE FACTORS YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IS I CAN'T GIVE A A ONE'SEYES FITS ALL RECOMMENDATION AND INDEED I'M NOT CAN TO GIVE MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS I'M SIMPLY GEN SPELL OUT WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THE RESEARCH WHICH HOLFULLY WILL POINT YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF FIGURING OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU IN TERMS OF SALT AND INDEED FLUID INTAKE THERE IS A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT EVERYBODY IS CONSUMING TOO MUCH SALT AND I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF QUALITY PAPERS THAT POINT TO THE FACT TH HAT A QUOTIN QUOTE HIGH SALT DIET CAN BE BAD FOR VARIOUS ORGANS AND TISSUES IN THE BODY INCLUDING THE BRAIN IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT BECAUSE FLUID BALANCE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF CELLS IS CRUCHALT NOT JUST FOR YOUR HEART AND FOR YOUR LUNGS AND FOR YOUR LIVER AND FOR ALL THE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY BUT ALSO FOR YOUR BRAIN THAT IF THE SALT CONCENTRATION INSIDE OF CELLS IN YOUR BRAIN GO BECOMES TOO HIGH NURONCS SUFFER MIGHT THEY WILL DRAW FLUID INTO THOSE CELLS BECAUSE WATER TONS TO FOLLOW SALT AS I MENTION BEFORE AND THOSE SELLS CAN SWELL YOU CAN LITERALLY GET SWELLING OF BRAIN TISSUE CONVERSELY IF SALT LEVELS ARE TOO LOW INSIDE OF CELLS IN ANY TISSUE OF THE BODY BUT IN THE BRAIN INCLUDED THEND THE CELLS OF THE BODY AND BRAIN CAN SHRINK BECAUSE WATER IS PULLED INTO THE EXTRA CELLERR SPACE AWAY FROM CELLS AND INDEED UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS BRAIN FUNCTION CAN SUFFER AND INDEED THE OVER ALL HEALTH OF THE BRAIN CAN SUFFER SO THERE ARE MANY REPORTS OUT THERE INDICATING BOTH AN EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND TO SOME EXTENT IN HUMANS THAT OVER CONSUMPTION OF SALT IS BAD FOR BRAIN FUNCTION AND LONGEVITY AND YET THERE IS ALSO DECENT EVIDENCE IN BOTH ANIMAL MODELS AND HUMANS THAT IF SALT CONSUMPTION IS TOO LOW THEN BRAIN HEALTH AND LONGEVITY WILL SUFFER AS WILL OTHER ORGANS AND TISSUES OF THE BODY SO LIKE MOST THINGS INMOLOGY YOU DON'T WANT THINGS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW NOW I WOULD SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDIES OUT THERE POINT TO THE FACT THAT A HIGH SALT DIET IS DETRIMENTAL TOF BRAIN HEALTH AND FUNCTION MOST OF THE STUDIES HAVE FOCUSSED ON THAT ASPECT OF SALT BALANCE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES ON BRAIN FUNCTION ONE CRITICAL ISSUE WITH MANY OF THOSE STUDIES HOWEVER IS THAT THE HIGH SALT DIET IS OFTEN COUPLED TO OTHER ELEMENTS OF DIET THAT ARE ALSO ONHEALTHY THINGS LIKE EXCESSIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF CARBOHYDRATES OR FATS OR COMMINATIONS OF CARBOHYDRATES AND FATS AND SO WHILE I KNOW THERE MANY BURNING QUESTIONS OUT THERE ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT ONE NEEDS IF THEY ARE ON A LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIET OR IF THEY ARE FASTING OR IF THEY ARE ON A VIGAN DIET THERE HAVE SIMPLY NOT BEEN MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE LOW MOTERATE AND HIGH SALT CONDITIONS ON A BACK DROP OF VERY CONTROLLED NUTRITION AND THAT'S PROBABLY REFLECTIVE OF FACT THAT THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF VERY WELL CONTROLLED NUTRITION STUDIES OUT THERE THERE ARE SOME OF COURSE BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO ADHERE TO NUTRITIONAL PLANS IN A VERY STRICT WAY AND TO DO THAT FOR SUFFICIENT PERIODS OF TIME THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT THE VARIOUS HEALTH OUTCOMES TO OCCUR NONE THE LESS THERE SOME INTERESTING REPORTS THAT INDICATE THAT THE AMOUNT OF SAL LT IN TAKE CAN INDEED PREDICT HEALTH OUTCOMES OR WHAT WE CALL HAZARDOUS EVENTS I THINGS ALIKE CARTY VASCULAR EVENTS AND STROKE AND SO FORTH AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT INDEED A LOWER NOT SING LOW MI BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WANT YOUR DIET TO BE TRULY LOW IN ANYTHING EXCEPT PERHAPS POISON BUT A LOWER SALT DIET CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THESE SO CALLED HAZARDOUS EVENTS BUT IT'S A SOMEWHAT OF A SHALLOW YOU SHAPED FUNCTION SUCH THAT YESS INDEED A HIGH SALT IN TAKE CAN BE VERY DETRIMENTAL FOR YOUR HEALTH BOTH IN TERMS OF CARTY VASCULAR EVENTS STROKE AND AND OTHER DILITERIOUS HEALTH EVENTS BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE THAT ACTUALLY SITS QUITE TO THE RIGHT MEANING HIGHER THAN WHAT IS TYPICALLY RECOMMENDED FOR SALT AND TAKE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THESE HAZARDOUS EVENTS AT LEAST SOME REPORTS POINT TO THAT AND SO I WONE EMPHASIZE WHAT ONE OF THOSE PARTICULAR REPORTS SAYS AND I ALSO ONE TO BE SURE TO COUNTER IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONTECTS AT THAT STUDY WAS SED IN BECAUSE AGAIN MY GOLL HERE IS NOT TO GIVE YOU A STRICT RSET OF RECOMMENDATIONS AT ALL IS TO POINT YOU TO THE LITERATURE TRY NO MAKE THAT LIRATURE IS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE AND ALLOW YOU TO EVALUATE FOR YOURSELF I DON'T YOU SAY THAT TO PROTECT US I SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU BECAUSE INDEED YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTH IN YOUR HEALTH CHOICES SO THE PAPER THAT I AM REFERRING TO THE VERY INTERESTING ONE WE OF COURSE NEVER WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON ANY ONE REPORT BUT THIS IS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE TITLE OF THE THE PAPER IS URINARY SODIUM AND POTASSIUM EXCRETION AND A RISC OF CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS WE HAVE NOT TALKED MUCH ABOUT POTASSIUM YET BUT SODYMIN POTASSIUM TEND TO WORK IN CONCERT IN THE BRAIN EMBODY IN ORDER TO REGULATE VARIOUS PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND HEALTH AND WILL TALK MORE ABOUT POTASSUMUS TIME GOES ON THE KEY PLOT OR SEIT OF DATA IN THIS STUDY A FOR THOSE WHO DO WANT TO LOOK IT UP WE WILL LINK TO IT NTHERE ALLOT OF DATA IN HERE IT BUT IS FIGURE ONE WHICH IS BASICALLY EVALUATING THE AMOUNT OF URINARY EXCRETION OF SODIUM WHICH IS A SOMEWHAT INDIRECT BUT NONE THE LESS VALUABLE MEASURE OF HOW MUCH SODIUM PEOPLE WERE INGESTING AND PLOTTED AGAINST THAT IS WHAT THEY CALL THE HAZARD RATIO AND THE HAZARD RATIO POINTS TO A THE COMPOSIT OF CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH STROKE MIROCARDIAL IN FACTION AND AN EMPARCT IS AN INJURY AND HOSPILIZATION FOR CONGESSIVE HEART FAILURE AND WHAT IT POINTS TO IS THE FACT THAT THE HAZARD RATIO IS LOW ISH AT SODYMIXCRETION OF ABOUT TWO GRAHAMS PER DAY BUT THEN CONTINUES TO GO DOWN UNTIL ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE TO FIVE GRAHAMS PERD AY THAT REMEMBER THIS AS SODIUMICSCRETION SO IT'S REFLECTIVE OF HOW MUCH SODIUM WAS IN THE BODY WHICH IS REFLECTIVE OF HOW MUCH SODIUM WAS INGESTED AND THEN THE HAZARD RATIO INCREASES FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY A VERY A STEEP SLOPE HEADING ANYWHERE FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT TO TEN AND OUTTOWARDS YOU KNOW TWELVE GRAMS OF SODIUM EXCRETION PER DAY SO THE SIMPLEST WAY TO INTERPRET THESE DATA ARE THAT AT FAIRLY LOW LEVELS OF SODIUM MEANING IT ABOUT TWO GRAMS PER DAY YOU RUN FEWER HEALTH RISKS BUT THE NUMBER OF RISK CONTINUES TO DECLINE AS YOU MOVE TOWARDS FOUR AND FIVE GRAMS PER DAY AND THEN AS YOU INCREASE YOUR SALT IN TAKE FURTHER THEND THE RISK DRAMATICALLY INCREASES SO NO STUDY IS WHOLLY NOR IS ANY FIGURE IN ANY STUDY OR ANY COLLECTION OF STUDIES WHOLLY RATHER WE ALWAYS WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT THE BULK OF DATA IN A PARTICULAR FIELD REVEAL NONE THE LESS I THINK THAT THE PLOT THAT WE DESCRIBED MEANING THE THE GRAFTTHAT WE DESCRIBED AS PRETTY INTERESTING IN LIGHT OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AMERICANS WHICH ARE WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE CONSUME NO MORE THAN TWO POINT THREE GRAMS MEANING TWENTY THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF SODIUM PER DAY THAT'S ABOUT HALF A TEASPOON OF SALT PER DAY NOW MOST PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY CONSUMING MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE INJESTING PROCESS FOODS AND PROCESS FOODS TEN TO HAVE MORE SALT IN THEM THE NON PROCESS FOODS NOW OF COURSE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE RIGHT SEE SALT IS NOT A PROCESS FOOD IN MOST CASES OF AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ON PROCESS FOODS THAT CAN BE HIGH IN SODIUM BUT PROCESS FOODS IN PARTICULAR AND HAVE ALOTO SODIUM YOU CAN SEE THIS SIMPLY BY LOOKING AT THE PACKAGING OF ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FOODS BUT IF WE ARE TO TAKE THIS NUMBER OF TWO POINT THREE GRAHMS THAT'S THE THE RECOMMENDED CUT OFF FOR INGESTION OF SODIUM IT ACTUALLY FALLS AND A PORTION OF THE CURVE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A MOMENT AGO THAT INDEED IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW HAZARD OUT LO LOW INCIDENTS OF HAZARD IS OUTCOMES CARDVASCULAR VENT STROKE ET CETERA BUT THE INJEST ACCORDING TO THAT PLOT THE INGESTION OF FOUR OR FIVE GRAMS OF SODIUM ALMOST DOUBLE OR MORE SODIUM THAN IS CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED IS ASSOCIATE WITH EVEN LOWER NUMBERS OF OF HAZARDOUS EVENTS SO WE NEAD TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND WE NEED TO EXPLORE IT IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER STUDIES OF COURSE AND WE NEED TO AVALUATE T IN TERMS OF THIS THING THAT WE'VE BEEN GOING BACK TO AGAIN AND AGAIN WHICH IS CONTEXT RIGHT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS OF TWO POINT THREE GRAM PER DAY CUT OFF IS IN THE CONTEXT OF A LANDSCAPE WHERE SOME PEOPLE DO INDEED HAVE HY PERETENSION OR PREHYPERETENSION THE INCIDENTS OF HIGH PRETENSION AS GONE UP DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS AND SEEMS TO CONTINUE TO GO UP WHETHER OR NOT THATS BECAUSE OF INCREASE SALT INTAKE OR WHETHER NOTS BECAUSE OF INCREASE SALT IN TAKE AND OTHER THINGS SUCH AS HIGHLY PROCESSFOODS THAT ISN'T CLEAR AGAIN POINTING TO THE THE CHALLENGE IN DOING THESE EPI DEMEOLOGICAL STUDIES AND REALLY PARSING WHAT ASPECTS OF A CHANG IN A SOME HALTHMETRIC IS DUE TO FOR INSTANCE THE INGESTION OF MORE SUGAR'S VERSES MORE SALTS OR SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE INGESTION MORE SALTS IT'S A COMPLICATED ALMOST BARBED WIRE TOPIC BY NOW BUT WE CAN START TO PULL APART THAT BARBED WIRE TANGLE AND START TO A VALUATE SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER CONDITIONS THAT EXIST OUT THERE MAY BE FOR YOU THAT ACTUALLY WARRANT MORE SODIAMEN TAKE IM WHERE MORE SODIUM AND TAKE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE BENEFICIAL SO AGAIN I WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR LOOD PRESSURE IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR YOUR PREPIDE PRETENSIVE YOU SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT DOING ANYTHING THAT INCREASES YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND AS ALWAYS YOU WANT IT OF COURSE TALKET YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT DOING ANYTHING THAT COULD ADJUST YOUR HEALTH IN ANY DIRECTION BUT NONE THE LESS THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT PAPERS THAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN RECENT YEARS I WANT OF POINT TO ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR THIS IS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL AUTOMNOMIC NORO SCIENCE BASIC AND CLINICAL BECAUSE THIS PAPER LIKE SEVERAL OTHER PAPERS ASK THE QUESTION AND INDEED THEY ASKED THE QUESTION IN THE TITLE ITS A REVIEW DIETARY SODIUM AND HEALTH HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH FOR THOSE WITH ORTHOSTATIC DISORDERS NOW ORTHOSTATIC DISORDERS COME IN A BUNCH OF DIFFENTVARIETIES AND WEREGONG TO TALK ABOUT THOSE IN A MOMENT BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAVE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE I PEOPLE THAT GET DIZZY WHEN THEY STAND UP PEOPLE THAT ARE FEELING CHRONICALLY FATIGUED AND IN SOME CASES NOT ALL THOSE GROUPS CANNECTUALLY BENEFIT FROM INCREASING THEIR SODIA MEN TAKE SEVERAL EPISODES TO GO ON THE HUBORAN LAPACAS I GAVE IT WHAT IT JUST CLEARLY WHAT WE CALL ANECDATA WHICH IS NOT EVEN REALLY DATAS JUST ANECDOTAL DATA OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS ALWAYS FEELING HUNGRY AND CRAVING SUGAR AND BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY ALSO HAD LOW BLOOD PRESSURE I HAD THEM TALK TO A PHYSICION AND THEY GOT PERMISSION TO TRY A LOMINY EXPERIMENT ON THEMSELVES AND SO THEY DID AND THAT MANY EXPERIMENT WAS ANY TIME THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE CRAVING SUGAR OR THEY WERE FEELING A LIGHT HEADED AND DIZZY RATHER THAN REACHING FOR SOMETHING WITH COLORIC AN TAKE THEY TOOK A LITTLA BIT OF SEESALT A LITTLE PINCH OF SEASALT AND PUT IT INTO SOME WATER AND DRANK IT OR IN A THE CASE OF THIS INDIVIDUAL THY WOULD ASHLY TAKE A LITTLE SESALT PACKET AND HEY OULD SHUGES DOWN AS SEESALT PACKET AND FOR THEM THAT PROVIDED TREMENDOUS RELIEF FOR THEIR DIZZINESS BUT THAT OF COURSE WAS IN THE CONTECT OF SOMEWHAT ABNORMALLY LOW BLOOD PRESSURE SO I DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE ALONE IN THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THEIR SUFFER FROM A LOW PLOOD PRESSURE CONDITION MANY PEOPLE OUT THEIR SUFFER FROM A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE CONDITION SO KNOW YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND UNDERSTAND THAT BLOOD PRESSURE IN PART IS REGULATED BY YOU RSODIA MEN TAKE AND YOUR SODIUM BALANCE WHY WELL BECAUSE OF THE OSMILARITY OF BLOOD THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHERE IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN CONCENTRATION OF SODIUM MEANING SUFFICIENT SODIUM IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM THAT WILL TEND TO DRAW WATER INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND ESSENTIALLY THE PIPES THAT ARE YOUR CAPALARIES ARTERIES AND AND VEINS WILL BE FULL THE BLOOD PRESSURE WILL GET UP TO YOUR HEAD WHEREAS SOME PEOPLE THEIR LOOD PRESSURE IS LOW BECAUSE THE OSMILARITY OF THEIR BLOOD IS LOW AND THAT CAN HAVE A NUMBER OF DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCES I SHOULD ALSO MENTION IT CAN BE THE CONSEQUENTS ITSELF OF CHALLENGE IS OR OR EVEN DEPHISITS AND KIDNEY FUNCTION BUT ALL OF THESE ORGANS ARE WORKING TOGETHER SO THE ENCOURAGEMENT HERE IS NOT NECESSARILY TO INGESTS MORE SODIUM IS TO KNOW YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND TO ADDRESS WEATHER NOT IN INCREASE IN SODY MEN TAKE WOULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IN A WAY THAT COULD RELIEVE SOME OF THE DIZZINESS AND OTHER SYMPTOMS OF THINGS LIKE ORTHOSTATIC DISORDERS BUT OF COURSE TO DO THAT IN A SAFE CONTEXT AND TO NEVER PLAY GAMES WITH YOUR BLOOD SUGAR OR YOUR BLOOD OSMILARITY THAT COULD SET YOUR SYSTEM DOWN A CASCADE IF NEGATIVE EVENTS LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FOR PEOPLE THAT SUFFER FROM ORTHOSTATIC DISORDERS LIKE ORTHOSTATIC HYPO MEANING TOO LOW TENSION ORTHOSTATC HYPROTENSION POSTERAL TACIC CARDIA CYNDRUM SOME TIMES REFER TO AS POTS P O T S OR IDIOPATHIC ORTHOSTATIC TACIC CARDIA AND SYNCOPE THESE HAVE INCREDIBLY ELABORATE NAMES THOSE GROUPS ARE OFTEN TOLD TO INCREASE THEIR SALT IN TAKE IN ORDER TO COMBAT THEIR SYMPTOMS THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HY PROTENSION RECOMMENDS ANYWHERE FROM SIX THOUSAND TO TEN THOUSAND THESE ARE VERY HIGH LEVELS SO THIS IS SIX GRAMS TO TEN GRAMS OF SALT PER DAY KEEPING IN MIND AGAIN THAT SALT IS NOT THE SAME AS SODIUMS O THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED TO FOUR THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF SODIUM PER DAY GANNOT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS AND GET MORE OF THE CITATIONS I I'LL REFER YOU BACK TO THIS A STUDY ON DIETARY SODIUM AND HEALTH HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH FOR THOSE OF THORTHOSTATIC DITORS WE WILL PUT A LINK TO THIS IN THE THE CAPTION SHOWNOTES SO THAT'S NONCIOUS IN THE OU AS THE SALT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CANADIAN CARTY OF ASCLER SOCIETY ARE TEN THOUSAND MELIGRAMS OF SALT PERDASO FOUR GRAMS OF SODIUM IS WHAT THAT EQUATES TO AND ON AND ON AND ON FOUR THINGS LIKE POTS FOR THESE POSTERAL CYNDRUMS THAT RESULT FROM OR I SHOULD SAY FROM THESE CYNDRUMS THAT INVOLVE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE WHEN PEOPLE STAND UP OR IN CERTAIN POSTURES SO I POINT OUT THIS PAPER AND I POINT OUT THESE HIGHER SALT RECOMMENDATIONS TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT CONTEXT IS VITAL RIGHT THAT PEOPLE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE ARE GOING TO NEED CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF SALT INTAKE PEOPLE WITH LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE AND MAYBE WITH SOME OF THESE POSTURAL ORTHOSTATIC SYNDRUMS ARE GOING TO NEED HIGHER MOUNTS OF SALT AND FOR MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO EVALUATE HOW MUCH SALT INT AKE IS GOING TO ALLOW YOUR BRAIN AND BODY TO FUNCTION OPTIMALLY AND THERE ARE SOME FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD WAYS TO EXPLORE THAT AND THERE SOME WAYS TO EXPLORE THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIRST AND SALT APPETITE THAT CAN MAKE THAT EXPLORATION ONE IN WHICH IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A CONSTANT WANDERING AROUND IN THE DARK AND WHERE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU FOR MOST PEOPLE A MODER INCREASE IN SALT IN TAKE IS NOT GOING TO BE DETRIMENTAL PROVIDED THAT YOU CONSUME ENOUGH FLUIDS IN PARTICULAR WATER I MEANING IF YOU HAPPEN TO OVER EAT SALT A BIT YOU WILL GET THIRSTY YOU WILL INGEST MORE WATER AND YOU WILL EXCRETE THE EXCESSODIUM THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE BODY CAN STORE SODIUM IN VARIOUS ORGANS THAT STORAGE OF SODIUM MAY OR MAY NOT BE A DETRIMENTAL THING IN GENERAL ECCESS STORAGE OF SODIUM AND TISSUES IN ORGANS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY IS NOT THOUGHT TO BE GOOD FOR LONG TURM HEALTH SO EATING MUCH MORE SODIUM THAN YOU NEED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IS INDEED BAD FOR YOU EARLIER I MENTION THAT SALT AND YOUR HUNGER AND THIRST FOR SALT IS HOMIOSTATICALLY REGULATED A INDEED THAT'S THE CASE MUCH LIKE TEMPERATURE IS HOMEOSTATICALLY REGULATED WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO IT IF YOUR SALT LEVELS ARE LOW YOU WILL TEND TO CRAVE SALT AND SALTY BEVERAGES AND SALTY FOODS AND IN MOST CASES YOU SHOULD PROBABLY FOLLOW THAT CRAVING PROVIDED THOSE SALTY BEVERAGES AND SALTY FOODS ARE NOT BRINGING IN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS OR ANYTHING IDEALY THAT'S BAD FOR YOU SO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WHETHER NOT YOUR VIGAN VEGETARIAN CARNIVOR OMNIVOIR THAT WE SHOULD ALL TRY TO LIMIT OUR INGESTION A PROCESS FOODS I MY READ OF THE LITERATURE IS THAT SURE SOME PROCESS FOODS ARE ACCEPTABLE FOR US AND AREN'TGOIN TO KILL US OUTRIGHT BUT THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD EATING FEWER PROCESS FOODS IS JUST GOING TO BE A GOOD THING TO DO SO FOLLOWING YOUR SALT HUNGER AND THIRST IN MOST CASES IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL PROVIDED THAT IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF EATING HEALTHY NON PROCESS FOODS ON WHATEVER BACKDROP OF NUTRITIONAL NDIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS IS RIGHT FOR YOU I SIMPLY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT TO EAT AND WHAT NOT TO EAT BECAUSE I ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE VIGANS BECAUSE OF ETHICAL REASONS RELATED TO ANIMALS OR SOME PEOPLE ARE VIGANS BECAUSE OF YOU DON'T REASONS RELATED TO A THE CLIMATE AND AND THE ENVIRONMENT OTHER PEOPLE AM DO IT FOR SPECIFIC HEALTH REASONS LIKEWISE I KNOW PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT EAT MEAT AND AVOID VEGETABLES BELIEVEIT OR NOT AND I KNOW PEOPLE THAT EAT BOTH AND THEY DO THIS OFTEN EACH I SHOULD SAY ALL SIHTING LITERATURE THAT SUPPORTS THEIR PARTICULAR CAMP IN THEIR PARTICULAR VIEW IT'S NOT A TER RATORY I WANT TO GET INTO BUT WITH RESPECT TO SALT IN TAKE AND THE FACT THAT HOME THAT SALT IN TAKE IS HOMIOSTATICALLY REGULATED IT IS THE CASE THAT IF YOUR CRAVING SALT YOU PROBABLY NEED IT SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE SWEATING EXCESSIVELY OR EVEN IF YOUARE IN A VERY HOT ENVIRONMENT A AND YOU'RE NOT EXERCISING IN YOUR JUST LOSING A YOUR LOSING WATER AND SALT FROM YOUR SYSTEM REMEMBER ALSO THAT YOU CAN BE IN A VERY COLD ENVIRONMENT VERY COLD DRY ENVIRONMENTS OFTEN GO TOGETHER AND YOU CAN BE LOSING A LOT OF FLUIDS FROM YOUR BODY AND YOU WILL CRAVE FLUIDS AND SALT EVEN THOUGH IT'S COLD AND YOUR NOT ASHY A PERYOU NOTICEABLY PERSPIRING SO IF YOUR EXERCISING LOT OF YOUR PARTICULAR COLD DRY ENVIRONMENT OR PARTICULAR HOT ENVIRONMENT YOU OUGHT TO BE IN JASTING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF SALT AND FLUID A RULE OF THUMB FOR EXERCISE BASED REPLENISHMENT OF FLUID A COMES FROM WHAT I A SOME EPISODES BACK REFERRED TO AS THE GALPIN EQUATION A THE GALOPIN EQUATION A I NAMED IT ILL THE AFTER ANDEGALPIN AND I THINK  THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE ATTRIBUTION THERE A ANDY GALLOPIN IS AN EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGIST AT A CALSTATE FULLERTON I BELIEVE A AND HE'IS GOING TO BE A POTCAST GAST HERE ON THE HUBERING LAPODCASSTIES IN EXCEPTIONAL MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGIST HE ALSO LIVES IN THE PRACTICAL REALM WHERE HE GIVES RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT A EXERCISE TO EXPERT ATHLETES AS WELL AS THE EVERYDAY PERSON SO THE GALOPIN EQUATION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE LOSE ABOUT ONE TO FIVE POUNDS OF WATER PER HOUR WHICH CAN DEFINITELY IMPACKT ARE MENTAL CAPASCITY AND OUR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND THE REASON THAT LOSS OF WATER FROM OUR SYSTEM IMPATSMENTAL PASSING PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH LITERALLY THE CHANGES IN THE VOLUME OF THOSE CELLS THE SISE OF THOSE CELLS BASED ON HOW MUCH SODIM IS CONTAINED IN OR OUTSIDE THOSE SELVS AND SOMETHING THAT I H'VE ALLUDED TO BEFORE ON THE PODCAST AND I'LL TALK ABOUT MORE A IN A MOMENT WHICH IS THAT NURONS SIGNAL TO ONE ANOTHER BY WAY OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH SOMETHING ALL THE ACTION POTENTIAL AND THAT ACTUUL REQUIRES SODIUM AND POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM SO THE GALOPIN EQUATION SUGGESTS THAT WE START EXERCISE HYDRATED WITH ELECTROLITES NOT JUST WITH WATER SO THAT MEANS WATER THAT HAS SOME SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM THEIR SIMPL LOW COSTWAYS TO DO THAT WILL TALK ABOUT AND THE FORMULA FOR HYDRATION THE SOCAL GALPAN EQUASION IS YOUR BODY WEIGHT IN POUNDS DIVIDED BY THIRTY EQUALS THE OUNCES OF FLUID YOU SHOULD DRINK EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT MAY TURN OUT TO BE MORE FLUID THAN YOU CAN COMFORTABLY CONSUME  DURING THE ACTIVITY THAT YOUR PERFORMING NOW THE GALOPIN EQUATION IS MAINLY DESIGN FOR EXERCISE BUT I THINK IS ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD RULE OF THUMB FOR ANY TIME THAT YOU NEED TO ENGAGE MENTAL CAPACITY NOTJUST PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE YOUR BODYWEIGHT INPOUNDS DIVIDED BY THIRTY EQUAL THE ATHE OUNCES OF FLUID YOU SHOULD DRINK EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN YOU HAVE TO INJEST IT EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES ON THE DOT AND I THINK MANY ACTIVITIES PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO COGNIVE ACTIVITIES LIKE ZUME MEETINGS OR IN PERSON MEETINGS OR LECTURING OR RUNNING OR CYCLING ARE GOING TO MAKE IT COMPLICATED TO INJEST THE APPROPRITE AMOUNT OF FLUID EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES ON THE DOT I'M NOT GIN TO SPEAK FOR ANDY FOR DOCTOR GALOPIN BUT I THINK HE WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT THESE ARE AVERAGES TO SHOOT FOR AND THAT UNLESS YOUR HYPER NERADIC THE IDEA IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOURE ENTERING THE ACTIVITY COGNITIVE OR OR PHYSICAL SUFFICIENTLY HYDRATED AND THAT THROUGHOUT THAT ACTIVITY YOUR HYDRATING REGULARLY AND IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY UNDER HYDRATING BUT NOTJUST UNDER HYDRATING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF NOT INJESTING ENOUGH WATER THAT THEE PROBABLY NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTROLITES AS WELL SODIAN PATASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM SO I'VE SAID TWO SOMEWHAT CONTRADICTORY THINGS ON THE ONE HAND I SAID FOLLOW YOUR SALT APPETITE FOLLOW YOUR SALT THIRST IF YOUR CRAVING SALT IN JEST SOME SALT UNTIL YOU STOP CRAVING THE SALT ON THE OTHER HAND IAVE GIVEN YOU THIS ON FAIRLY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THE GALPANEQUATION THAT YOU SHOULD INJEST YOUR BODY WEIGHTIN POUNDSED ABOUT ED BY THIRTY THAT'S HOW MANY OUNCES OF FLUID YOU SHOULD DRINK EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES WHICH I'M GUESSING FOR MOST PEOPLE IS GOING O BE MORE FLUID THAN THEIR CURRENTLY DRINKING ON AVERAGE AND SO HOW COULD IT BE THAT YOU CAN HAVE A RECOMMENDATION FOR WHAT'S OPTIMAL THAT'S DIFFERENT THAND THE AMOUNT THAT YOU WOULD REFLECTIVELY DRINK AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THE HORMONE SYSTEMS LIKE THES APRESS AN ANTIDEERATIC HORMON OTHER HORMONES LIKE ALDOSTERONE AND A LOT OF THE NURAL AND HORMONAL SIGNALS THAT GOVERN SALT AND WATER BALANCE ARE FAIRLY SLOW TO KICK IN SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU EAT A FAIRLY SALTY MEAL AND YOU SENSE THAT SALT YOU'LL PROBABLY MEANING YOU DETECTED AND PERCEIVE IT BECAUSE THE FOO TASTE SALTY YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO DRINK A FAIR AMOUNT OF FLUID WITH IT WHEREAS IF SOME OF THE SALT IS DISGUISED BY OTHER FLAVOR SOMETHING THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NURL REPRESENTATION OF THINGS LIKE SALTY AND SWEET WELL THEN YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE THAT SOMETHING SALTY AND THEN A FEW MINUTES OR HOURS AFTER INJESTING THAT MEAL YOU MIGHT FEEL VERY VERY TIRED YOU MIGHT EVEN WONDER WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BECAUSE OF SOME BLOOD SUGAR EFFECT  MAYBE IT'S A CRASHIAN BLOOD SUGAR YOU MIGHT THINK AM OR SOMETHING ELSE RELATED TO THAT MEAL OR MAYBE YOU THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUN OR SOME OTHER EVENT IN YOUR LIFE BUT ACTUALLY WHAT YOU WHAT HAS HAPPEN AS YOUR DEHYDRATED BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THAT YOU NEEDED TO DRINK MORE FLUIDS SO I WANT OF ACKNOWLEDGE THE A THE CONTRADICTION IN THE IDEA THAT EVERYTHIN IS HOMEOSTATICALLY REGULATED AND THEREFORE YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT YOU NEED AND THE COUNTER AR UMENT THAT I YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THESE STRICT RECOMMENDATIONS IS AS H GAN TO BE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN AND OF COURSE YOUR BODY AND BRING CAN START TO ADAPT TO CERTAIN LEVELS OF SALT INTAKE THERE'S A NOW FAIRLY A FAMOUS STUDY A THAT WAS DONE IN GERMANY WHICH LOOKED AT DIFFERENT PHASES OF SALT INTAKE MEANING THEY HAD SUBJECTS IN JEST EITHER TWELVE GRAMS OF SALT PER DAY OR NINE GRAMS PER DAY OR SIX GRAMS PER DAKE FOR FAIRLY LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND THEY COLLECTED YOUREIN FOR TESTING THIS IS ETUA VERY CONTROLLED STUDY IM JUST CAN A PARAPHRASE FROM THE A NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH A REPORT ON THE STUDY BECAUSE AM THEY DID A VERY NICE RIGHT UP OF IT A AND THEY SAY THAT YOU KNOW A BIG SURPRISE OF THESE RESALTS IS THAT WHATEVER THE LEVEL OF SALT THAT WAS CONSUMED SODIUM WAS STORED END RELEASED FROM THE SUBJECT'S BODIES IN FAIRLY REGULAR WEAKLY AND MONTHLY PATTERNS MEANING PEOPLE TENDED TO ADAPT TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SALT INTAKE AND THEND LED TO A FAIRLY CONSTANT AMOUNT OF SALT RETENSION AND YOURE IN FLUID EXCRETION AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE VARIOUS HORMONES LIKE ALDOSTRON WHICH REGULATE SODIUMIX CRETION FROM THE KIDNEY AND LUCCOCORTICOIDS WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT MORE IN A MOMENT WHICH HELP REGULATE METAVLS AN LUCOCORTICQUOIDS ARE A RELEASED FROM THE ADRENAL GLANDS WHICH RIDE THE TOP THE KIDNEYS AND THEREIS A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STRESS SYSTEM GLUCCOCORTIQUOIDS AND THE SALT SYSTEM SO THE THE REASON WHY YOUR SALT APPETITE ISN'T A PERFECT REDOUBT OF HOW MUCH SALT YOU SHOULD INJEST AND WHY IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO FOLLOW SOME OF TESE FORMULAS LIKE THE GALPANEQUATION ESPECIALLY IF YOUARE ENGAGING AN EXERCISE WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO BE PERSPIRING OF COURSE IS THAT YOUR BODY WILL TEND TO ADAPT TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SALT IN TAKE OVER TIME AND THEN YOUR APPETITE FOR SALT WON'T NECESSARILY BE THE BEST INDICATION OF HOW MUCH SALT YOU SHOULD IN JEST OR AVOID BEFORE I MOVE ON I WANT TO REALLY RE EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT INSIDE OF THE GALPAN EQUASION THERE IS THAT MENTION OF EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES AND PEOPLE HAVE COME BACK TO ME AGAIN AND AGAIN ABOUT THE SAYING I CAN'T DRINK THAT MUCH WATER EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IT'S TOO MUCH A VOLUME OF FLUID IN MY STOMACH I CAN'T RUN WITH THAT AT CETERA REMEMBER THESE ARE AVERAGES SO THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO AVERAGE AROUND OF PARTICULAR ACTIVITY THESE ARE NOT STRICT RECOMMENDATIONS WHERE A BUZZER GOES OFF IN EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES YOU HAFTER CHUG THAT EXACT AMOUNT OF ELECTROLITE CONTAINING SOLUTION ANOTHER KEY FEATURE OF THE STUDY  THAT I WAS REFERRING TO BEFORE OF WHICH INCIDENTLY WAS PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL CLINICAL INVESTIGATION IS THAT THE BODY REGULATES IT SALT AND WATER BALANCE NOT JUST BY CRETING SODIUM I BUT BY RETAINING O RELEASING WATER AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SODIM AND WATER THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE AND THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MECHANISM THEY STATE HERE ON PARIPHRASING IS THAT THE LONG TERN MAINTENANCE OF BODY FLUIDS IS DEPENDENT IS NOT AS DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL WATER AS ONCE BELIEVED RIT WHAT THIS SYSTEM PROBABLY EVOLVED TO DO WHAS TO ADJUST TE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SODIUM AVAIL OF BILITY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT RAISES A REALLY KEY ELEMENT OF SALT AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN HUMAN HISTORY IN HUMAN EVOLUTION AND HUMAN HEALTH EVEN TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS AND THEIR SEVERAL VERY GOOD BOOKS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SALT YOU KNOWS SALT WAS THAT WAS A VERY VALUABLE AND HEAVILY SAUGHT AFTER SUBSTANCE THROUGHOUT MUCH OF HUMAN HISTORY SO MUCH SO THAT THEIR ACTUALLY WRITTEN REPORTS OF PEOPLE BEING PAID FOR LABOR IN THE FORM OF SALT AND YW SALT AT WHEN IT SCARCE COULD HAS BEEN QUITE EXPENSIVE IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE WORLD ESPECIALLY REGIONS LOCATED FURTHER AWAY FROM THE SEA AND A A FRIEND OF MINE WHO A HAS DEEP ROOTS WITHIN THE CULINARY COMMUNITY TOLD ME ABOUT TRAVELING TO A TO SOME SOMEWHAT IMPOVERISHED AREAS OF OF EUROPE SOME YEARS AGO AND GOING INTO HOMES WHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KITCHEN TABLE THERE WAS A A FISH A SALTY FISH HANGING FROM A THREAD A ABOVE THE TABLE AND THAT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF TABLE SALT THE COMMON PRACTICE WAS TO TAKE ANY FOOD THAT NEEDED SOME SALT FOR ADDITIONAL FLAVORING AND ASHALLY RUB THAT FOOD ON THIS SALTY FISH OR TO SQUEEZE THE FISH A BIT ON TO A ON TO THE FOOD SUBSTANCE IN ORDER TO GET SALT FROM IT SO YOU KNOW THAT'S A VERY A CON  EXTREME EXAMPLE NOWDAYS WE CAN OFE TAKE SALT FOR GRANTED AND A MOT MOST OF THE DISCUSSION OUT THERE IS ABOUT EXCESS SALT BUT AS I POINTING OUT THAT YOU KNOW SALT FOR A LONG TIME HAS A BEEN A VERY SAUGHT AFTER COMMODITY AND ONE THAT PEOPLE REALLY CHERISHED FOR THEIR HEALTH IN THE EPISODE THAT I DID ON METABOLISM I TALKED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SALT AND IODINE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN IODINE AND WHETHER NO IODIE SALT OR NONIODIZE SALT IS BEST OR REQUIRED A ID INCOURGE YOU TO LISTEN TO THAT EPISODE WHICH WAS ABOUT AGAIN METABOLISM A SOME PEOPLE MAY NEED MORE IODINE INTAKE SOME PEOPLE PERHAPS DO NOT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EVEN WANT IN JUST THINGS LIKE CELP SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT SO A PLEASE LISTEN TO THAT EPISODE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE IODINE ASPECTS OF SALT WHICH HAVE DIRECT IMPACT ON THIEROID HARMON AND THIEROID FUNCTION WHICH OF COURSE RELATES TO METABOLISM NOW DAYS THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN AND EVEN A KIND OF PROLIFERATION OF A WHAT I CALL FANCY SALTS SO WHETHER NOT YOU SHOULD BEIN JUSTING SEA SALTS OR COMMON WHETHER NOT COMMON TABLE SALT WILL SUFFIT A WILL SUFFICE IN MOST CASES A FOR WHAT WERE DISCUSSING HERE COMMON TABLE SALT IS FINE A BUT I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT SEA SALT OFTEN CONTAINS OTHER MINERALS WHICH CAN BE VERY USEFUL AND WE WILL DO ENTIRE EPISODES ON THOSE OTHER MINERAL SO SEA SALT CAN CONTAIN A YOU KNOW IT DOZENS OR MORE OF MINERAL SOME OF WHICH CAN BE QUITE VALUABLE TO OUR HEALTH OTHERS OF WHICH ARE ARE LESS LESS IMPORTANT AT ONLY NEED TO BE CONSUMED IN TRACE AMOUNTS BUT YOU RE NOT GOING TO GET MANY MINERALS IF ANY FROM COMMON TABLE SALT AND THAT'S WHY IN ADDITION TO THE PRETTY COLORS AND PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE REPORT THAT THEY ACTUALLY TASTE ETER ASOME OF THESE OF SO CALLED FANCY SALTS OR SEA SALTS YOU MIGHT WANT A CONSUME A A MORE ADVANCED FORM OF SALT IF YOU WILL ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSEITS ACTUALLY THE MORE PRIMITIVE A FORM OF SALT OF ITS ACTUALY THE ONE THAT COMES FROM THE OCEAN SO WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT HOW EXCESSALT IS BAT FOR BLOOD PRESSURE DAMAGE THE HEART THE BRAIN ET CETERA I DO ON TO GIVE SOME VOICE TO SITUATIONS WHERE TOO LITTLE SALT CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE PROBLEMS AND THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SWITHOUT GETTING INTO EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF DETAIL THE KIDNEYS AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ARE GOING TO REGULATE SALT AND FLUID BALANCE THE A DREMAL GLANDS WHICH RIDE ATOPT THE CYDNES ARE GOING TO MAKE LUCOCORDICOIDS LIKE ALDOSTRONE AND THOSE ARE GOING TO DIRECTLY INPACT THINGS LIKE FLUID BALANCE AND IN PART THEY DO THAT BY REGULATING HOW MUCH CRAVING FOR AND TOLERANCE OF SALTY SOLUTIONS A WE HAVE AND O THERE SOME REALLY NICE STUDIES THAT HAVE LOOKED AT SO CALLED A DREMELECTIMES NOW THIS AN EXTREME CASE AND ITS TYPICALLY DONE IN ANIMAL MODELS BUT IT ILLUSTRATES THE ROLL OF THE ADRENALS IN SALT PREFERENCE BASICALLY WHEN THE GLUCOCORDICOID SYSTEM MEANING THE RELEASE OF THESE PARTICULAR HORMONS FROM THE ADRENAL GLANDS IS ELIMINATED BY A DREAMALECTINMY ECTOMY MEANS REMOVAL THEN THE THRESHOLD FOR WHAT'S CONSIDER TOO SALTY REALLY SHIFTS OCHA SO TYPICALLY WHEN THE ADDREMALS ARE INTACT A ANIMAL ARE A HUMAN WILL PREFER A MILDLY SALTY TO MODERATELY SALTY SOLUTION IF GIVEN A CHOICE AND THAT SOME POINT ITS SO SALTY THAT IT IS FEELS AVERS IF IT JUST LIKE TAKING A GULP OF SEA WATER IS ALMOST ALWAYS A VERSE IF I CANTHING OF AN INSTANCE WHERE IT'S NOT A VERSE IF IN ACTUALLY DRINKING SEA WATER CAN KILL YOU BECAUSE OF THE HIGH OSMOLARITY OF SEA WATER HE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO DRINK SEA WATER UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE THE ADREMALS ARE MISSING ANIMALS AN HUMANS WILL TEND TO PREFER A HIGHER SODIUM CONCENTRATION FLUID AND THEY WILL BE WILLING TO TOLERATE IN JESTING VERY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF SODIUM NOW THAT'S A VERY CRUDE EXPERIMENT AND NOT ONE THAT YOU WANT TO DO I PROMISE YOU BUT I MENTION IT BECAUSE IT ILLUSTRATES THE VERY DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STRESS SYSTEM WHICH IS THE GLUCCOCORTICOID SYSTEM AND THE SALT CRAVING SYSTEM AND THIS AHI MAKE SENSE EARLIER AS WE RETOGNAHYPOVOLEMIC THIRST WHEN THERE'S A LOSS OF BLOOD PRESSURE FROM USUALLY DU TO A LOSS OF BLOOD FROM THE BODY THERE IS A SALT CRAVING IN ORDER TO BRING THAT BLOOD VOLUME BACK UP BECAUSE BY INJESTING SALT YOU BRING FLUID INTO THE BLOOD STREAM YOURE INCREASING THAT BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOU CAN RESTORE THE BLOOD THAT'S LOST NOW THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES WHERE IF SODIUM LEVELS GET TOO LOW IN THE BLOOD STREAM EITHER BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE INJESTING TO LITTLE SALT OR THEY ARE INJESTING TOO MUCH WATER AND THEREFORE EXCREETING TOO MUCH SALT THAT IT CAN CAUSE STRESS AND ANXIETY THERE' SOME REALLY NICE DATA THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT LOW DIETARY SODIUM CAN ACTUALLY EXASCERBATE ANXIETY IN ANIMAL MODELS AND TO SOME EXTENT THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR THIS IN HUMANS AS WELL AND THAT SHOULD NOT COME AS A SURPRISE THE WHOLE BASIS FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ADRENAL SYSTEM THESE GLUCOCORTICOIDES THINGS LIKE ALDOSTRONE AND THE CRAVING FOR SODIUM IS THAT THE STRESS SYSTEM IS A GENERIC SYSTEM DESIGNE TO DEAL WITH VARIOUS CHALLENGES TO THE ORGANISM TO YOU OR TO ME OR TO AN ANIMAL AND THOSE CHALLENGES CAN ARRIVE IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS THET CAN BE AN INFECTION IT CAN BE FAMINE IT CAN BE LACK OF WATER AND SO ON BUT IN GENERAL THE STRESS RESPONSE IS ONE OF ELEVATED HEARTRATE ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE AND AN ABILITY TO MAINTAIN MOVEMENT AND RESISTANCE TO THAT CHALLENGE I IE SAID THIS BEFORE BUT I'LL EMPHASIZE IT AGAIN THERE'S THIS COMMON MIS PERCEPTION THAT STRESS MAKES US SICK AND INDEED IF STRESS LAST TOO LONG IT HAS A NUMBER OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR HEALTH BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IF WE'RE PUSHING PUSHING PUSHING WERE STUDYING OR TAKING CARE OF SOMEBODY OR TRAVELING LIKE CRAZY WE DON'T TEND TO GET SICK UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS BUT AS SOON AS WE STOP AS SOON AS WE REDUCE HAR DRENAL AN OUTPUT AS SOON AS WE REDUCE OUR GLUCOCORTICUOITE OUTPUT FROM OUR DREANALS THEN WE WILL GET SICK THAT'S A VERY COMMON OCCURRENTS AND IT'S BECAUSE STRESS ACTUALLY ACTIVATES ARMIAN SYSTEM IN THE SHORT TERM SO I'D LIKE TO A TRYING TO SPELL THIS MITH THAT STRESS ACHALLY SUPPRESSES THE UMIAN SYSTEM AT LEAST NOT IN THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TRUM STRESS DIFFERENT ISSUE YOU DON'T WANT LONG TERM ON GOING STRESS SMUSCHLY OF SEVERAL WEEKS OR MORE NONE THE LESS IT MAKE SENSE THAT BRINGING SODIUM INTO THE BODY WOULD BE AT LEAST ONE WAY THAT WE WOULD BE WIRE TO COUNTERACT OR TO A RESIST STRESS ORES I STRESSERS BEING THE THINGS ON THE OUTSIDE COMING AT US SO IT CAN BE STRESTFUL RELATIONSHIPS STRESSFUL JOB SITUATION AGAIN INFECTION AND SO ON IT'S CLEAR FROM A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT IF SODIUM LEVELS ARE TOO LOW THAT OUR ABILITY TO MEET STRESS CHALLENGES IS IMPAIRED NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO PLACE YOUR SDIMEN TAKE COSMICALLY HIGH BUT IT DOES POINT TO THE FACT THAT IF YOUR FEELING ANXIOUS PERHAPS FROM LOW BLOOD PRESSURE WHICH CAN ALSO GIVE SEMTEMS OF ANXIETY AS WE TALKD ABOUT BEFORE BUT EVEN IF ITS INDEPENDENT OF LOW BLOOD PRESSURE THAT SLIGHTLY INCREASING SODIUMEN TAKE GAIND I WOULD INCOURAGE PEOPLE DO THIS NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF PROCESS FOODS AND DRINKS BUT IDEALLY IN THE FORM OF MAYBE A LOW BIT OF OF SEA SALT AND WATER OR SALTING ONE'S FOOD A LOBIT MORE THAT THAT CAN STABLE EYES BLOOD PRESSURE AND ONE'S ABILITY TO LEAN INTO STRESSERS IN CHALLENGES AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE ASSUM OM THAT ADDING SALT IS ALWAYS BAD WHEN IN FACT THAT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE THERE ARE CONDITIONS SUCH AS WHEN WE ARE UNDER STRESS CHALLENGE WHEN THERE IS A NATURAL CRAVING FOR MORE SODIUM AND THAT NATURAL CRAVING FOR MORE SODIUM IS HARD WIRED INTO US AS A WAY TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO KNOW WHETHER NOT PEOPLE OUT THERE SPECIALY THE LISTENERS OF THIS PODCASTS ARE GETTING TOO MUCH JUST ENOUGH OR TOO LITTLE SODIUM SO I CAN'T KNOW THAT I'M SHOUTING INTO A TUNNEL HERE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH SODIUM YURE INGESTING BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME FOR MOST PEOPLE ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT HIGH PRETENSIVE PREHIE PRETENSIVE THERE SOME WIGAL ROOM TO EXPLORE WHETHER MORE INTAKE OF SODIUM COULD ACTUALLY BE BENEFICIAL FOR SUPPRESSING SOME OF THE ANXIETY RESPONSES THAT THEY MIGHT FEEL UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS AGAIN MORE STUDIES NEED TO BE DONE IS CERTAINLY MORE STUDIES AN HUMANS NEED TO BE DONE BUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRESS AND SODIUM IN TAKE IN THE FACT THAT ADDITIONAL SODIUM IN TAKE MAY BE BENEFICIAL AND INDEED IS NATURALLY STIMULATED BY STRESS SHOULDN'T BE NECESSARILY LOOKED AS A PATHOLOGICAL EVENT I KNOW WHEN SOME PEOPLE GET STRESS THEY CRAVE SALTY FOODS THAT ACTUALLY HARD WIRED BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENO THAT YOU SEE NOTJUST INHUMANS BUT IN ANIMALS BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY PRIMITIVE MECHANISM WHEREBY YOUR BODY IS PREPARING TO MEET ANY ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN STRESSERS NOW WE CAN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT SODIUM WITHOUT HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OTHER ELECTROLITES MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM MAGNESIUM IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH IN AN AN EXTENSIVE ENOUGH TOPIC THAT WE SHOULD PRABALY DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE JUST ON MAGNESIUM FOR PURPOSES TODAY'S DISCUSSION I JUST WILL BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME OF THE FORMS OF MAGNESIUM THAT WE DISCUSSED ON THE PODCAST BEFORE IN DIFFERENT CONTECTS ONE EMPHASIZE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY GETTING ENOUGH MAGNESIUM IN THEIR DIET THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO SUPPLEMENT MAGNESIUM SOME PEOPLE HOWEVER OPT TO SUPPLEMENT MAGNESIUM IN WAYS THAT CAN SUPPORT THEM AND THEREARE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF MAGNESIUM AND JUST IN VERY BRIEF PASSING I'LL JUST SAY THAT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOU CAN REDUCE MUSCLE SORENESS FROM EXERCISE BY INGESTION OF MAGNESIUM MALETE AMAL A T E I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT MAGNESIUM THREE INATE T H ARE E N O A T E MAGNESIUM THREE NATE FORSAKE OF PROMOTING THE TRANSITION INTO SLEEP AND FOR DEPTH OF SLEEP AND PERHAPS AGAIN HIGHLIGHTED PERHAPS CANS WRITE NOW INCE MAINLY ANIMAL STUDIES AND ON GOING HUMAN STUDIES BUT THE DATA ARNOLIN PERHAPS MAGNESIUM THREE INNATE CAN BE USED AS A WAY TO SUPPORT COGNIVE FUNCTION AND LONGEVITY THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR JACK FELDMAN FROM USIOLE TYPICALLY MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATE IS TAKN THIRTY A SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE BEDTIME IN ORDER TO INCURGE SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO OURG NORAL THAT WORK NEWS LETTER AND LOOK FOR THE ONE ON SLEEP AND YOU CAN SEE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR I SHOULD SAY THE THE A OPTIONS FOR THAT BECAUSE AGAIN YOU SHOULD ALWAYS A CHECK WITH YOUR PHYSICION THOSE ARE STRICT ACROSS THE BOARD RECOMMENDITIONS AND THEN THERE R OTHER FORMS OF MAGNESIUM MAGNESIUM BISGLICINATE WHICH IS SOME ONE OF ALL TERNATIVE TO THREE IN ETE A NOT KNOWN TO HAVE CYGNIV ENHANCING EFFECTS BUT A SEEMS AT LEAST ON PAR WITH MAGNESIUM THREE IN ETE IN TERMS OF PROMOTING TRANSITION INTO IN DEPTH OF SLEEP AND SO ON THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF MAGNESIUM MAGNESIUM CITRATE WHICH A HAS OTHER FUNCTIONS ACTUALLY MAGNESIUM CITRATE IS A IS A FAIRLY EFFECTIVE A LAXITIVE AM A NOT KNOWN TO PROMOTE SLEEP AND THINGS THAT SORT SO A LOT OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF MAGNESIUM AND THEIR STILL OTHER FORMS OUT THERE MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH MAGNESIUM MANY PEOPLE ARE O CA SO THAT'S MAGNESIUM ANY TIME WERE TALKING ABOUT SODIUM BALANCE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION POTASSIUM BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE KIDNEY WORKS AND THE WAY THAT SODIUM BALANCE IS REGULATED BOTH IN THE BODY IN THE BRAIN IS THAT SODIMAN POTASSIUM ARE WORKING IN CLOSE CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER THERE RA LOT OF DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT RATIOS OUT THERE AND THEY RANGE WIDELY FROM TWO TO ONE RATIO OF POTASSIUM TO SODIUM I'VE HEARD IT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOO I HAVE HEARD A TWO TO ONE SODIUM TO POTASSIUM A THE RECMENDATIONS VARY ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS PODCASS FOR INSTANCE ELEMENT SH HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS EPISODE IN BEFORE THE RATIO THERE IS A GRAM OF SODIUM TO TWO HUNDRED MELIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM SIXTY MELIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM THERE THEY AVEOPTED FOR A A A FIVE TO ONE RATIO OF SODIUM TO POTASSIUM AND OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE OUHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN HYDRATION ELECTROLIKE FORMULAS THOUGH PUT SEE SALT IN SOME WATER MAYBE EVEN IN JUST A POTASSIUM TABLET IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT AND IMPORTANT CONTECTTUAL ELEMENT IS YOUR DIET SO FOR INSTANCE CARBOHYDRATES HOLD WATER IN THE BODY SO REGARDLESSOF HOW MUCH SALT AND HOW MUCH FLUIDYOR IN JESTING IF YOURE NJUSTIN CARBOHYDRATE AND YOU DRINK FLUIDS WATER SOME OF THAT FLUIDIS CAN BE RETAINED IN THE BODY NOW FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE FOLLOWING LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIETS ONE OF THE MOST IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF A LOWCARBORHYDRATE DIET IS THAT YOU'RE GOING ESCREETE MORE WATER AND SO UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS YOUARE ALSO GOING TO LOSE NOT JUST WATER BUT YOU'LL PROBABLY ALSO LOSE SODIUM IN POTASSIUM AND SO SOME PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE IN FACT FIND THAT WHEN THEY ARE IN A LOWER OR LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIET THEN THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE GETTING ENOUGH SODIUM AND ENOUGH POTASSIUM AND SOME PEOPLE DO THAT BY TAKING NINETY NINE MILIGRAM POTASSIUM TABLETS EVERY TIME THEY EAT SOME PEOPLE DO THAT BY INJESTING MORE FOODS THAT CONTAIN POTASSIUM A AND OF COURSE SOME PEOPL WHO ARE ON LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIETS DO IN JEST VEGETABLES YOU KNOW OR OTHER FORMS OF A FOOD THAT THAT CARRY ALONG WITH THEM POTASSIUM SO IT'S QUITE VARIABLE FROM PERSON TO PERSON AM YOU CAN IMAGINE IF CARBOHYDRATE HOLDS WATER WATER AND SALT BALANCE AN POTASSIUM GO HAND IN HAND AND HAND THAT IF YOU ARE ON A LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIET THAT YOU MIGNE TO ADJUST YOUR SALT INT I IN POTASSIUM AND CONVERSELY THAT IF YOUR ON A CARBOHYDRATE RICH DIET OR A MOTERATE CARBOHYDRA DIET THAN YOU MAY NEED TO IN JUST LESS SODIUM AND LESS POTASSIUM AND IN FACT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER IS PROBABLY COMING IN THROUGH THE FOODS YOU EAT AS WELL SO I DON'T SAY ALL THIS TO CONFUSE YOU AGAIN I SAY THIS BECAUSE IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CONTECT I'L GIVE YET ANOTHER CONTECTS THAT I THINK ITS FAIRLY COMMON NOWADAYS WHICH IS MANY PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING A PATTERN OF EATING THAT MORE OR LESS RESEMBLES INTERMITTIN FASTING OR AT LEAST TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING SO THEIR EATING BETWEEN PARTICULAR FEEDING WINDOWS AND THEN IN THE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCLE NOT JUST SLEEP BUT DURING SRMEN PARTS OF THEIR WAKING CYCLE THERE ALSO ACTIVELY AVOIDING FOOD A BANKING ON I THINK A EITHER THE POSSIBLE ON SAY POSSIBLE LONGEVITY PROMOTING EFFACTS OF INTERITAIN FASTING OR AND OR I SHOULD SAY THEY ARE BANKING ON THE FACT THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE NOT EATING IS EASIER THAN PORTION CONTROL FOR CERTAIN PARTS OF THE DAY AND SO THEY FIND IT BENEFICIAL TO LIMITED CALORIES OVER ALL A TO A GIVEN AMOUNT DEPENDING ON WHAT THEIR GOALS ARE BY NOT CONSUMING FOOD FOR CERTAIN PERIODS OF THE DAY BUT USUALLY DURING THOSE PERIODS OF DAY THEYARE CONSUMING FLUIDS AND OFTENTIMES THOSE FLUIDS INCLUDE NOT JUST WATER BUT CAFFINE AND CAFFINE IS A DIORATIC IT ACTUALLY CAUSES THE EXCRETION OF FLUIDS FROM THE BODY IN PART BECAUSE IT CAUSES THE EXCRETION OF SODIUM ALL OF THAT TO SAY THAT IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO FOR INSTANCE EATS YOUR FIRST MEAL AROUND NOON OR ONE OR TWO P M AND YOUR FASTING FOR THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY AND YOUR DRINKING COFFEE OR TEA OR AND OR INJESTING A LOT OF WATER YOU ARE GOING TO BE EXCREDING SODIUM ALONG WITH THAT WATER AND SO MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FIND THAT IT'S USEFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM DRINKING CAFFINE DURING THAT SO CALLED FASTING OR A YOU KNOW NON FOOD IN TAKE PART OF THE OF TIME OR STRICTED FEEDING THAT IAM MAKING SURE TO GET ENOUGH SALT EITHER IN THE FORM OF SOMETHING LIKE ELEMENT A AN ELECTRO LIKE DRINK OR PUTTING SOME SEASALT INTO SOME WATER OR CERTAINLY ANY TIME ONE IS IN JESTING CAFFINE REPLACING SOME OF THE LOST WATER BY INCREASING ONE'S WATER INTAKE THERE 'S SOME SIMPLE RULES OF THUMB AROUND THIS THAT I THINK CAN GET MOST PEOPLE A INTO A PLACE WHERE THEIR A MORE COMFORTABLE AND FUNCTIONING BETTER WHICH IS FOR EVERY AUNCE OF COFFEE OR TEA THAT YOU DRINK ISHOUS A CAFFINATED COFFEEOR TEA THAT YOU DRINK THAT YOU CONSUME ONE AND A HALF TIMES AS MUCH WATER SO THET SAY YOU HAVE YOU KNOW AN EIGHT ALENCE COFFEE OU NO TRINE DRINK ABOUT YOU DON'T T TO BE EXACT BETRINE DRINKIN ABOUT A TWELVE OUNCE GLASS OF WATER AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT A TINY BIT OF SODIUM INTO THAT BY TINY BIT I JUS MEAN A TINY PINCH OF SODIUM CAUSE REMEMBER EVEN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF SODIUM IN TAKE OVER ALL THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SODIUM CONTAINED IN SALT IS SUFFICIENTLY HIGH THAT EVEN JUST EN A QUARTER TEASPOON IS GOIN REALLY START TO MOVE THAT NUMBER UP TOWARDS THAT RANGE A THAT STILL WITHIN THE SAFE RANGE BUT YOU CAN IF YOU KEEP DOING THAT ALL DAY LONG OR VERY QUICKLY GIN AG T INTO THAT EXCESS OF SALT IN TAKE RANGE THAT IS DILITERIOUS FOR HEALTH SO AGAIN IF YOUR CONSUMING MORE CAFINIOAR GOING TO BE EXCREETING WATER AND SALT AND POTASSIUM AND SO YOU CAN HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO BRING WATER SALT AN POTASSIUM BACK IN AGAIN THIS HAS TO BE EVALUATED FOR EACH OF YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS IF YOU'RE EXERCISING FAST IT AND YOUR DOING THAT AFTER DRINKING CAFFINE THEND BEFORE DURING AND CERTAINLY AFTER EXERCISE YOUR GOTO ON TO REPLENISH THE FLUIDS AND ELECTROLITES THAT YOU LOST INCLUDING SODIUM SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THIS ALL STARTS TO BECOME PRETTY DIZZYING AND YET IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DOZIN WE CAN PROVIDE SOME USEFUL RANGES THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE WILL WORK AND SO LET'S TALK ABUT WITH THOSE RANGES ARE AND IM ONE A POINT YOU TO A RESOURCE THAT EXPLORES WHAT THOSE RANGES ARE IN THESE VARIOUS CONTECTS OF NUTRITION EXERCISE AND SO ON THE RESOURCE IS A BOOK THAT WAS AUTHORED BY DOCTOR JAMES D NICOLANTONIO A HE'S NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR HE'S A A SCIENTISTS A TO IS CARDYOFASCULAR A PHYSIOLOGY AS WELL I BELIEVE IS A DOCTOR OF PHARMACI AND THE TITLE OF THE BOOK IS THE SALT FIX THE SALT FIXES AN INTERESTING READ BECAUSE IT POINTS TO FIRST OF ALL THE HISTORY OF SALT A IN SOCIETY AND AS IT RELATES TO HEALTH IT ACTUALLY EMPHASIZES SOME OF THE MAJOR MISSTEPS MAYBEVEN PRETTY DRASTIC ERRORS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO INTERPRET A THE ROLL THAT SALT HAS IN VARIOUS A DISEASES AND EMPHASIZES SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH PERHAPS INCREASING SALT CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND I THINK IT STRIKES A PRETTY NICE BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT'S COMMONLY KNOWN ABOUT SALT AND WHAT I BELIEVE OUGHT TO BE KNOWN ABOUT SALT OR AT LEAST TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION YE THEY THE BOOK DOES PROVIDE CERTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS A AND I TUALLY REACH OUT TO THE AUTHOR I HAVE NEVER MET HIM IN PERSON OR TALKED HIM DIRECTLY AAND I ASKED HIM A OUTRIGHT AI SAID HOW MUCH SALT A DOYOU RECOMMEND PEOPLE TAKE ON AVERAGE AND A HE GAVE OF COURSE THE APPROPRIATE CAVIATS ABOUT PREHI PRETENSION HIH PRETENSION ET CETERA BUT MADE A RECOMMENDATION WHICH UM I'LL JUST SHARE WITH YOU AND AND IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE A SUPPORT FOR THIS RECOMMENDATION YOU CAN CHECK OUT HIS BOOK THE THE RECOMMENDATION HE MADE WAS ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE GRAHAMS OF SALT TO DAY WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THREE POINT TO TO FOUR POINT EIGHT GRAHAMS OF SODIUM SO GOING BACK TO THE CURRENT A RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE TWO POINT THREE GRAHMS OF SODIM PERDAY THIS IS ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TIMES TO YOU DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SODIUM THAT'S CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED A IN MOST CIRCLES AND WHAT THIS CORRESPONDS TO IS ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TO TO TEASPOONS OF SALT PER DAY TO ARRIVE AT THAT THREE POINT TO TOFOR POINTING GRAHMS OF SODIUM AGAIN S THE RECOMMENDATION  THAT WAS PASSED ALONG A FOR MOST PEOPLE MOST CONDITIONS BARRING YOU KNOW A SPECIFIC HEALTH A HEALTHIS SHUES NOW WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING AS HE POINTED TO A SODIUM TOF POTASSIUM RATIO WHICH IS A FOUR GRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND HE ALSO MENTION FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM AND POINTED OUT AND I GENERALLY AGREE HERE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE DEFICIENT IN MAGNESIUM SO AGAIN O THAT WAS A THREE POINT TWO TO FOUR POINTT GRAMS OF SODIUM FOUR GRAHMS OF POTASSIUM YOU MIGHT THINK WELE GACHETZA ONE AND HALF TO TWO TIMES THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATION BUT WE CAN GO BACK TO THAT STUDY THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE EPISODE THAT TWO THOUSAND ELEVENTH STUDY ARE DESCRIBED THIS OF SORT OF A JASHAPED CURVE IN WHICH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OCCURRENTS OF THESE NEGATIVE HEALTH EVENTS THEY WERE FAIRLY LOW AT LOWSODIUMEN TAKE LOWER STILL AT SLIGHTLY HIHER SODIMEN TAKE MUCH IN LINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE MADE A THAT WERE THAT OF DOCTOR A DE NICOLANTONIO ON PASSED ALONG TO ME AND THEN THEY INCREASE CRITE THOSE TALT A RISKINCREASE QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY AS ONE MOVES OUTPAST YOU KNOW SIX CRAMS OF SODIUM SEVENGRAMS OF SODIUM PREDAY THAT'S WHEN THINGS A REALLY DO SEEM TO GET HAZARDOUS A AND REALLY IT MAKE SENSE I THINK GIVEN THAT CONSENSUS AROUND THIS TO REALLY AVOID VERY HIGH SALT INTAKE SO THE SALT FIX DESCRIBES THE RASIONAL BEHIND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ESALT FIX ALSO DESCRIBES IN ANQUITE O BEAUTIFUL DETAIL THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SALT IN TAKE POTASSIUMEN TAKE AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE SUGAR CONSUMPTION SYSTEM I'D LIKE TO PICK UP ON THIS IDEA OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SALT AND SUGAR BECAUSE I THINK THAT ONE KEY ASPECT OF THE WAY THAT SALT CAN WORK AND CAN BENEFIT US ORK AND HARM US HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT SODIUM AND SUGAR ARE REGULATED AND ACTUALLY PERCEIVED BY THE BRAIN AND HOW UNDER CONDITIONS OF CERTAIN LEVELS OF SODIUMEN TAKE WE MIGHT BE INSPIRED TO SEEK MORE SUGAR OR TO CRAVE SWEETS MORE OR LESS SALP UNTIL NOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SALT AS A SUBSTANCE AND A WAY TO REGULATE FLUID BALANCE AND BLOOD VOLUME AND SO ON WEVEN TALKED A LOT ABOUT SALT AS A TASTE OR THE TASTE OF THINGS THAT ARE SALTY AND YET WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SALT PRECEPTERS MEANING NURONS THET FIRE ACTION POTENTIALS WHEN SALTY SUBSTANCES ARE DETECTED MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE HAVE SWEET DETECTORS AND BITTER DETECTORS AND WE HAVE DETECTORS OF MAMI THE SAVORY FLAVOR ON OUR TONGUE AND EARLIER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE I TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SWEET RECEPTORS NURONS THAT RESPOND TO THE PRESENCE OF SUGAR OR EVEN NON COLORIC SWEET THINGS IN THE GOT IN THAT SIGNALS UP TO THE BRAIN THROUGH THE VAGUEST NERVE AND THOSE SIGNALS CONVERGE ON PATHWAYS T RELATE TO DOPOMINE AND SO ON WELL WE ALSO HAVE SALT CENSORS AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS HROUGHOUT OUR DIGESTIVE TRACT ALTHOUGH THAT THE SENSATION IN THE TASTE OF SALT ASHALLY EXERTS A VERY ROBUST EFFECT ON CERTAIN AREA S OF THE BRAIN THAT CAN EITHER MAKE US CRAVE MORE OR SATE MEANING FULFIL OUR DESIRE FOR SALT AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WY THIS WOULD BE IMPORTANT YOUR BRAIN ACTUALY HAS TO REGISTER WHETHER NOT YOUR BRINGING IN SALT IN ORDER TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE GOING TO CRAVE SALT MORE OR NOT AND BEAUTIFUL WORK THAT'AS BEEN DONE BY THE ZUKER LAB ZE CATEYAR SOKUR LAB AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS MANY OTHER LABS HAVE USED IMAGING TECHNIQUES AND OTHER TECHNIQUES SUCH AS MOLECULAR BIOLOGY TO DEFINE THESE SO CALL PARALLEL PATHWAYS PARALLEL MEANING PATHWAYS THAT REPRESENT SWEET OR THE PRESENCE OF SWEET TASTES IN THE MOUTH AN GUT PARALLEL PATHWAYS MEANING NURAL CIRCUITS THAT REPRESENT THE PRESENCE OF SALTY TASTES IN THE MOUTH AND GUT AND SO ON AND THAT THOSE GO INTO THE BRAIN MOVE UP THROUGH BRAINS STEMCENTERS AND UP TO THE NEO QUARTEX INDEED WHERE SEET OF OUR CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION IS TO GIVE US A SENSE AND A PERCEPTION OF THE COMPONENTS OF TE FOODS THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE INJESTING AND A SENSE IN A PERCEPTION OF THE FLUIDS AND THE COMPONENTS OF THOSE FLUIDS THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE INJESTING NOW PARALLEL PATHWAYS AS I'M DESCRIBE IN THEM ARE A FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE OF EVERY SENSORY SYSTEM NOT JUST THE TASTE SYSTEM BUT ALSO THE VISUAL SYSTEM WEV PARALLEL PATHWAYS FOR PERCEIVING DARK OBJECTS OR TOS LIGHT OBJECTS FOR PERCEIVING RED VERSES GREEN ET CETERA THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE OF HOW WE ARE BUILT AND HOW OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS AND IN THE TASTE SYSTEM MUCH LIKE IN THESE OTHER SYSTEMS THESE PATHWAYS ARE INDEED PARALLEL BUT THEY CONVERGE IN THAT CAN INFLUENTS ONE ANOTHER AND I THINK THE SIMPLEST WAY TO PUT THIS IS IN THE CONTEXT FIRST OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM WHEREBY YOURABILITY TO DETECT THE COLOR RED HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR EYE THAT ABSORB LONG WAVE LENGTHS OF LIGHT THAT WE CALL REDS RED WAVE LENGTHS OF LIGHT WHICH ARE LONGER WAVE LENGTHS THAN SAY BLUE LIGHT TO SHORTER WAVELING BUT IT IS REALLY THE COMPARISON OF THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF THE NURONS THAT ABSORB RED LIGHT WITH THE ACTIVITY OF THE NURONS THAT ABSORB GREEN LIGHT WHICH ACTUALLY GIVES YOU THE PERCEPTION OF RED THAT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE COUNTER INTUITIVE IBUT INDEED ITS NOT IT'S ACTUALLY BECAUSE SOMETHING IS RED AND HAS LESS GREENNESS THAT WE PERCEIVE IT AS MORE RED THAN THE GREEN AND THIS IS ACTUALLY THE WAY THAT YOUR ENTIRE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS IS THAT WE AREN'T REALLY GOOD AT A VALUATING ABSOLUTE LEVELS OF ANYTHING IN THE CONTECT OF PERCEPTION ITS ONLY BY COMPARISON AND ACTUALY THERE'S A FUN EXPERIMENT THAT YOU CAN DO I THINK YOU PROBABLY FIND EASILY ON LINE YOU COULD ALSO DO THIS EXPERIMENT AT HOME YOU CAN STARE AT SOMETHING THAT'S RED OR GREEN FOR THAT MATTER FOR A WHILE SO YOU MAKE AN ACTIVE UM DECISION TO NOT BLINK AND TO STARE AT SOMETHING THAT'S RED AND THEN YOU LOOK AWAY FROM THAT THING IN YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE A GREEN AFTER IMAGE OF THAT RED OBJECT CONVERSELY IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT'S GREEN FROWHON YOU STERATAN YOU LOOK AWAY YUL YOU WILL SEE THE RED AFTER IMAGE OF THAT THING NOW THE TASTE SYSTEM DOESN'T HAVE QUITE THE SAME AFTER TASTE A TYPE EFFECT A BUT NONE THE LESS THE PATHWAYS THE PARALLEL PATHWAYS FOR SALTY IN THE PARALLEL PATHWAYS FOR SWEET AND BITTER AND SO ON CAN ACTUALLY INTERRACT AND THIS HAS IMPORTANT RELEVANTS IN THE CONTECT OF FOOD CHOICES AND SUGAR RAVING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMMON PLACE NOWADAYS IS IN MANY PROCESS FOODS THERE IS A BUSINESS LITERALLY A BUSINESS OF PUTTING SO CALLED HIDDEN SUGARS AND THESE HIDDEN SUGARS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN THE FORM OF COLORIC SUGARS THERE SOMETIMES IN THE FORM OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERSE INTO VARIOUS FOODS AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL WHY WOULD THEY PUT MORE SUGAR INTO A FOOD AND THEN DISGUISE THE SUGARY TASTE GIVEN THAT SWEET TASTES OFTEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO EAT MORE OF THESE THINGS WELL IT'S AWAY ACTUALLY OF BY PASSING SOME OF THE HOMIOSTATIC MECHANISMS FOR SWEET UNOW EVEN THOUGH WE MIGHT THINK THAT THE MORE SWEET STUFF WE EAT THE MORE SWEET STUFF WE CRAVE INGENERAL PEOPLE HAVE A THRESHOLD WHEREBY THEY SAYK HAVE HAD ENOUGH A SUGARY STUFF YOU CAN ACTUALLY A EXPERIENCES IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IS REALLY REALLY SWEET TAKE A LITTLE SIP OF A WATER WITH A LABIT OF LEMON JUCIN IT OR VINEGAR AND IT WILL QUICKLY QUENCH THAT OVERLY SWEET SENSATION OR PERCEPTION IT WILL DISAPPEAR ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THERE'S ACTLY A PRACTICE IN A FANCY MEALS OF CLEANSING THE PALATE THROUGH THE INGESTION OF DIFFERENT FOODS AND THAT'S THE SAME IDEA THAT YOUR CLEANSING THE POTYRACHY NEUTRALIZING THE PREVIOUS TASTES SO THAT THEY CAN BRING YET ANOTHER DISH TO OVER INDULGE YOU A INDECADENCE AND SO FORTH SO THESE CENSORY SYSTEMS INTERACT IN THE WAY BY PUTTING SUGARS INTO FOODS AND HIDING THE SUGARY TASTE OF THOSE FOODS THOSE FOODS EVEN IF THEY CONTAIN ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS CAN ACTIVATE THE SORTS OF NURANS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNIN OF TE EPISODE LIKE THE NURROPOD CELLS THAT WILL THEN SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN TO RELEASE MORE DOPAME TO MAKE YOU CRAVE MORE OF THAT FOOD WHEREAS HAD YOU BEEN ABLE TO PERCEEVE THE TRUE SWEETNESS OF THAT FOOD YOU MIGHT HAVE CONSUMED LESSEN INDEED THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS SO THESE HIDDEN SUGARS ARE KIND OF DIABOLICAL WHY AM I TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS IN THE CONTECTS OF AN EPISODE ON SALT WELL AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY NOTICE A LOT OF FOODS OUT THERE CONTAIN A SALTY SWEET COMBINATION AND IT THAT COMMINATION OF SALTY AND SWEET WHICH CAN ACTUALLY LEAD YOU TO CONSUME MORE OF THE SALTY SWEET FOOD THAN YOU WOULD HAVE IF IT HAD JUST BEEN SWEET OR IT HAD JUST BEEN SALTY AND THAT'S BECAUSE BOTH SWEET TASTE AND SALTY TASTES HAVE A HOMIOSTATIC BALANCE SO IF YOU INJUST SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY SALTY PRETTY SOON YOUR APPETITE FOR SALTY FOODS WILL BE REDUCED BUT IF YOU MASK SOME OF THAT WITH SWEET WELL BECAUSE OF THE A INTERACTIONS OF THESE PARALLEL PATHWAYS YOU SOMEWHAT SHUT DOWN YOUR PERCEPTION OF HOW MUCH SALT YOU'RE INJESTING OR CONVERSELY BY INJESTING SOME SALT WITH SWEET FOODS YOU MASK SOME OF THE SEETNESS OF THE SWEET FOODS THAT YOU'RE TASTING AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO I NDULGE IN THOSE FOODS SO SALTY SWEET INTERACTIONS A CAN BE VERY DIABOLICAL AND CAN ALSO BE VERY TASTY THEY CAN BE VERY DIABOLICAL IN TERMS OF INSPIRING YOU TO EAT MORE OF A PARTICULAR FOOD THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE IF YOU WERE JUST FOLLOWING YOUR HOMEOSTATIC SALT OR YOUR HOMEOSTATIC SUGAR BALANCE SYSTEMS AND THE BEAUTIFUL IMAGING WORK THAT 'S BEEN DONE BY THE ZUCR LAV AN OTHER LAVS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO REVEAL HOW SOME OF THIS MIGHT WORK BY SHOWING FOR INSTANCE THAT A CERTAIN A ONSOMBOLE MEANING A CERTAIN GROUP OF NURANS IS ACTIVATED BY A SWEET TASTE AND A NOT OVERLAPPING DISTINCT SET OF NURONS JUST NEARBY SITTING YOU KNOW CHEEK TO JOWL WITH THOSE OTHER NARANS WOULD BE ACTIVATED BY SALTY TASTES AND YET OTHERS BY BITTER TASTE AT CETERA SO THERES A SEPARATE MAP OF THESE DIFFERENT PARALLEL PATHWAYS BUT THAT WHEN FOODS OR FLUIDS ARE INJESTED THAT ARE BOTH SALTY AND SWEET YOU GET A YET ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ON SOMBLE OF NURNS ACTIVATED SO YOUR BRAIN EVERWHETHER NOT ITS FOR YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM OR YOUR AUDITORY SYSTEM OR YOUR TASTE SYSTEM HAS A WAY OF REPRESENTING THE PURE FORM OF TASTE SALTY SWEET VETTER ET CETERA AND HAS A WAY OF REPRESENTING THEIR COMMINATIONS AND FOOD MANUFACTURERS HAVE AVE EXPLOITED THIS UM TO LARGE DEGREE I MENTION ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS LOOKING TOO EXPLORE EITHER INCREASING OR DECREASING YOUR SODIUMEN TAKE FOR HEALTH BENEFITS FOR PERFORMANCE BENEFITS IN MANY WAYS IT IS USEFUL TO DO THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF A FAIRLY PURE MEANING UNPROCESSED FOOD IN TAKE BACKGROUND WHETHER OR NOT THATS KITO CARNIVOR OMNIVOR A INTERMEN FASTING OR WHAT HAVE YOU IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BUT THE CLOSER THAT FOODS ARE TO THEIR BASIC FORM AND TASTE MEANING NOT COMLARGE COMMINATIONS OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF INGREDIENTS ET CERTAINLY AVOIDING HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS THE MORE QUICKLY YOUARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HONIAN ON YOUR SPECIFIC SALT APPETITE AND SALT NEEDS WHICH AS OF A POINT OUT NUMEROUS TIMESTHROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE ARE GOINGTO VERY FROM PERSON TO PERSON DEPENDING ON NUTRICION DEPENDING ON ACTIVITY DEPENDING ON HORMON STATUS OR EVEN PORTION OF YOUR MENSTRAL CYCLE FOR THAT MATTER SO IF YOU WANT A HOME IN ON THE APPROPRIAT AMOUNT OF SODIUM FOR YOU YES BLOOD PRESSURE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT METRIC TO PAY ATTENTION TO AS YOU GO ALONG AND THE PARAMETERS FOR HEALTHY BLOOD PRESSURE ARRANGES ARE READILY AVAILABLE ON LINES SO LHET YOU REFER TO THOSE OM IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THOSE FOR YOURSELF BUT IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT INCREASING YOUR SALT AN TAKE MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL FOR A FOR INSTANCE FOR REDUSING ANXIETY A BIT OR FOR INCREASING BLOOD PRESSURE TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE POSTRAL CYNDRUMS WHERE YOU GET DIZZY ET CETERA FOR IMPROVING SPORTS PERFORMANCE OR COGNIIVE PERFORMANCE I CAN ONLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO THIS IN A IN A FAIRLY CLEAN CONTEXT WHERE YOU'ARE NOT TRYING TO DO THIS BY INJESTING A BUNCH OF SALTY FOODS OR SALTY SWEET FOODS ET CETERA AND INDEED MANY PEOPLE FIND AND IT'S A REVIEWED A BIT AND SOME OF THE DATE ARE REVIEWED IN THE BOOK THE SALT FIX THAT WHEN PEOPLE INCREASE THEIR SALT AN TAKE IN THEY BACK DROP OF RELATIVELY UNPROCESS FOODS THAT SUGAR CRAVINGS CAN INDEED BE VASTLY REDUCED AND THAT MAKES SENSE GIVEN THE WAY THAT THESE NURAL PATHWAYS FOR SULTY AND SWEET INTERACT NOW THUS FAR I'VE ALREADY COVERED QUITE A LOT OF MATERIAL BUT I WOULD BE COMPLETELY REMISS IF I DIDN'T EMPHASIZE THE CRUCIAL ROLE THAT SODIUM PLAYS IN THE WAY THAT NURONS FUNCTION IN FACT SODIUM IS ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT ALLOWS NURONS TO FUNCTION AT ALL AND THAT'S BY WAY OF ENGAGING WHAT WE CALL THE ACTION POTENTIAL THE ACTION POTENTIAL IS THE FIRING OF ELECTRICELECTIVITY BY NURONS NURONS CAN ENGAGE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THEY HAVE GRATED POTENTIALS THEY HAVE GAP JUNCTIONS THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE OF DIFFERENT ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIES OF NURONS THAT I DON'T WANT TO GOING TO JUST YET LEAST NOT IN THIS EPISODE BUT THE ACTION POTENTIAL IS THE FUNDAMENTAL WAY IN WHICH NURONS COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER THEYRE SOMETIMES CALLED SPIKES JUST COME NOMING CLATURE THA NU A SCIENTISTS USE I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE ACTION POTENTIAL AND THE ROLL THAT SODIUM PLAYS AND THIS WILL INVOLVE A LITTLE BIT A CHEMISTRY BUT I PROMISE IT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO ANY ONE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHEMISTRY OR A PHYSIC'S BACKGROUND OR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY BACKGROUND NURONS HAVE AN INSIDE IN AN OUTSIDE AND INSIDE ARE THINGS LIKE THER GENETIC MATERIAL THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF THINGS FLOATING AROUND IN THERE THAT ALLOW THOSE SELLS TO FUNCTION AND THEY TEND AVE THIS WIRE EXTENDING OUT OF THEM SOMETIMES A VERY LONG WIRESOME TAS A SHORT ONE THAT WE CALL THE ACTS ON AND AT THE END OF THAT WIRE THAT ACTS ON THEY RELEASE LITTLE PACKETS OF CHEMICALS THAT EITHER CAUSE THE NEXT NURON TO FIRE ACTION POTENTIALS OR PREVENT THE NECTIONERON FROM FIRING ACTION POTENTIAL SO THEY CAN VOMIT OUT THESE LITTLE PACKETS OF OF CHEMICALS THAT EITHER INSPIRE OR SUPPRESS ACTION POTENTIALS IN OTHER NURONS THE WAY THAT THAT WHOLE PROCESS OCCURS IS THAT A GIVEN NURON NEEDS TO CHANGE ITS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITYES SO NORMALLY NURONS ARE HANGING OUT AND THEY HAVE WHAT WE CALL A NEGATIVE CHARGE AND THEY REASON THEY HAVE A NEGATIVE CHARGE IS THAT THE INSIDE OF THE CELL HAS THINGS FLOATING AROUND IN IT LIKE POTASSIUM A LITTLE BIT OF SODIUM AND SOME STUFF LIKE CHLORIDE THESE ARE LITERALLY JUST JUST IMAGINE THESE AS LITTLE LITTLE BOLLS OF STUFF AND IF THEY HAVE A NEGATIVE CHARGE ON THEM THAN THE INSIDE OF THE CELLARS CAN ATTEND TO BE MORE NEGATIVE AN OUTSIDE OF THE CELL IT TURNS OUT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT'S POSIIVELY CHARGE AND ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS IN CREATING THAT POSIVE CHARGE IS SODIUM SODIUM CARRIES A POSITIVE CHARGE SO YOU HAVE NURONS THAT YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE FORSAKE OF THIS A DISCUSSION YOU JUST IMAGINE AS A SPHERE WITH WIRE STICKING OUT OF IT THEY A YOU PUTTAL MINESS ON THE INS IDE FOR NEGATIVE YOU PUT WILL PLUSS ON THE OUTSIDE FOR POSITIVE AND WHEN THAT NURON IS STIMULATED BY ANOTHER NURON IF THE STIMULATION THE ELECTRICAL STIMULATION IS SUFFICIENTLY HIGH MEANING ANUGH LITTLE PACKETS OF NER TRANSMITTER HAVE BEEN VOMITED ON TO ITS SURFACE AT SUFFICIENT CONCENTRATION WHAT HAPPENS IS LITTLE PORS LITTLE SPACES LITTLE GAPS OPEN UP IN THE MEMBRANE OF THAT CELL THAT SEPARATES THE INSIDE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND BECAUSE IT'S POSITIVE THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE CHARGE OUTSIDE AND THERE'S LOT A NEGATIVE INSIDE IT'S LIKE A BOLDER RUNNING DOWN HILL ALL THE STUFF TENDS TO RUSH DOWN HILL IT TRIES TO CREATE EVEN AMOUNTS OF CHARGEOTS NEGATIVE ON THE INSIDE POSIM ON THE OUTSIDE AND WHAT HAPPENS IS SODIUM RUSHES INTO THE CELL CARRYING A LOT OF CHARGE INTO THE CELL AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE CHARGE OF THAT CELL GOES FROM NEGATIVE ACTUALLY VERY NEGATIVE TO QUITE POSITIVE AND IF IT HITS A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF POSITIVE CHARGE BECAUSE OF ALL THE SODIUMINS GOING INTO THE THE CELL THEND IT FIRES WHAT'S CALLED AN ACTION POTENTIAL AND IT VOMITS OUT ITS OWN SET OF CHEMICALS ON TO THE NEXT NERON AND SO IT SETS OFF A CHAIN OF ONE NURON GOES FROM NEGATIVE POSITIVE PLH VOMITS OUT CHEMICALS ONDER THE NEXT ONE THE NEXT ONE THE NEXT NURON THAT BINDS TO RECEPTORS OR ENTERS THE CELL AND THAT CELL GOES FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE CHARGE BA VOMITS IT'S CONTENTS ON TO THE NEXTEL AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SODIUM RUSHING INTO THE CELL THEREFORE IS THE WAY THAT THE ACTION POTENTIAL IS STIMULATED INOTHER WORD SODIUM IS THE WAY THAT NURON'S COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER THE NURONS DON'T STAY IN A POSITIVE CHARGE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD JUST KEEP VOMITING OUT THEIR CONTENTS BUT THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN SOME OF THAT IN THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO PREPARING TO DO IT THE NEXT TIME IN THE NEXT TIME BY RESTING A BIT AND TURNS OUT THAT THE WAY THEY RESTORE THEIR CHARGE IS BY PUSHING THAT SODIUM BACK OUT OF THE CELL THER MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO DO THAT THINGS LIKE THE SO CALLED SODIUM POTASSIUM PUMP THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE LEVELS OF A POTASSIUM ACROSS THE CELL MEMBRANE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH IF YOU WANT O LOOK AT A DEMONSTRATION THIS YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN PUT INTO WEBBROWSER  THE AT YOUKNOW THE ACTION POTENTIAL YOU'LL FIND SOME BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTIONS THERE AND YOU TOBE AND ELSEWHERE MAYBE SOME TIME ON A INSTERAM I'LL DO A DESCRIPTION WITH A DIAGRAM CAUSE I REALIZE NUMBER PEOPLE ARE JUST LISTENING TO THIS I CAN'T DO THAT HERE I WON'T DO THAT HERE CAUSE I WANT EVERY ONE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF MATERIAL REGARDLESSOF WITH ANOTHEIR WATCHING AND WERE LISTENING TO THIS BUT THE POINT ID LIKE TO MAKE AT LEAST AS IT RELATES TO THIS EPISODE ON SALT IS THAT HAVING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF SALT IN YOUR SYSTEM ALLOWS YOUR BRAIN TO FUNCTION ALLOWS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO FUNCTION AT ALL AGAIN THIS IS THE MO'S BASIC ASPECT OF NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION AND THERE A R CASES WEAR THIS WHOLE SYSTEM GETS DISRUPTED AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE TOPIC OF SODIUM AND WATER BALANCE S MANY VIEU HAVE PROBABLY HERD BUT HOPEFULLY IF YOU HAVEN'T YOU'LL TAKE THIS MESSAGE SERIOUSLY IF YOU DRINK TOO MUCH WATER ESPECIALY IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU CAN ACTUALLY KILL YOURSELF I AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IF YOU INJEST A LOT OF WATER IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SOMETHING ALLE HYPERNATREMIUM YOU WILL EXCRETE A LOT OF SODIUM VERY QUICKLY AND YOURABILITY TO REGULATE KINEY FUNCTION WILL BE DISRUPTED BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT YOUR BRAIN CAN ACTUALLY STOP FUNCTIONING SO PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY CONSUMED WATER TO EXCESS ESPECIALLY AFTER SPORTS EVENTS AND SO FORTH AND IF THAT WATER DOESN'T CONTAIN SUFFICIENT ELECTROLYTES YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN NURONS ABILITY TO FUNCTION AT ALL BY DISRUPTING THIS BALANCE OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM AND THE AMOUNT OF EXERCELER SODIUM AND NURON'S ABILITY TO SIGNAL TO ONE ANOTHER THROUGH ACTION POTENTIALS AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTION POTENTIALS ENOUGH THEY ARE THE WAY THAT I CAN LIFT MY PEN RIGHT NOW THEY THE WAY THAT I CAN SPEAK THER THE WAY THAT YOU BREATHE THEY LITERALLY CONTROL ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION NOW  TAKES QUITE A LOT OF WATER IN TAKE BEFORE YOU EXSCREET ENOUGH SODIUM THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS GOIN TO SHUT DOWN D I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT SIMPLY BY INGESTING MORE SODIUM YOUR NURONS WILL WORK BETTER BUT IT ABSOLUTLY IS THE CASE THAT IF YOU DON'T INGEST ENOUGH SODIUM THAT YOUR NURANS WON'T FUNCTION AS WELL AS THEY COULD AND THAT IF YOUR SODIUM LEVELS ARE MADE TOO LOW BY HEMORHAGE OR BY INJESTING SO MUCH WATER FLUID THAT YOU EXSCRETE EXCESS AMOUNTS OF SODIUM OR THROUGH ANY OTHER MECHANISM THAT IS THEN INDEED YOUR NURONS WON'T BE ABLE TO FIRE ACTION POTENTIALS AND YOUR BRAIN AN NERVOUS SYSTEM SIMPLY WON'T WORK AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY DEHYDRATION LEADS TO CONFUSION AND DIZZINESS AND LACK OF CORDINATION AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS A BIT AND THE EPISODE ON ENDURANCE BUT THERE ARE INSTANCESM WHICH YOU KNOW COMPETIVE ATHLETES HAVE COME INTO THE STADIUM TO FINISH A FINAL LAP OF A LONG ENDURANCE RACE AND ARE COMPLETE DISORIENTED AND ACTION CAN'T FIND THEIR WAY TO THE FINISH LINE YOU KNOW IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE HON OF A SILY AN A CRAZY EXAMPLE BUT THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE HAVING SEVERE MENTAL ISSUES AND PHYSICAL ISSUES POST EXERCISE WHEN THAT AEXERCISE INVOLVED A TON OF SWEATING OR HOT ENVIRONMENTS OR INSUFFICIENT INGESTION OF FLUIDS AND ELECTROLITES BECAUSE INFLUDED IN THA ELECTRA LIKE FORMULA OF COURSE IS SODIUM ANT AS YOU JUST LEARN SODIUM IS ABSOLUTE CRUCIAL FOR NURONS TO FUNCTION SO TO BRIEFLY RECAP SOME OF WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN MONITORS THE AMOUNT OF SALT IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND HOW THAT RELATES TO THIRST AND THE DRIVE TO CONSUME MORE FLUID AND OR SALTY FLUIDS ALSO STALK TO LITWL BIT ABOUT THE HORMONES THAT COME FROM THE BRAIN AND OPERATED THE LEVEL OF THE KIDNEY IN ORDER TO EITHER RE TAIN OR ALOW WATER TO LEAVE YOUR SYSTEM TALKD TO LUIBIT ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF THE KIDNE ITSELF A BEAUTIFUL ORGAN WE TALKED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SALT INTAKE AND VARIOUS HEALTH PERAMETERS AND HOW A PARTICULAR RANGE OF SALT IN TAKE MIGHT BE OPTIMAL DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THAT RANGE AS BEENG CONSUMED MEANING DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOUR HYPROTENSIVE PREHY PROTENSIVE OR NORMAL TENTION WE TALKED ABOUT FLUID INTAKE AND ELECTROLIT INTAKES SO SO THE IN PENTASSIUM MAGNESIUM IN THE CONTEXT OF ATHLETIC OR SPORTS PERFORMANCE BUT ALSO INTERMS OF MAINTAINING COGNAVE FUNCTION TUCK BY THE GALPAN EQUATION WHICH YOU CULD EASILY ADAPT TO YOUR BODYWAIGTE INTO YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES OF COURSE ADJUSTING THE AMOUNT OF FLUID AND ELECTROLITE INTAKE UPWARDS IF YOURE EXERCISING OR WORKING IN VERY HOT ENVIRONMENTS DOWNWARDS MAY BE IF YOUR LESS HOT ENVIRONMENTS FOR YOUR SWEATING LESS AND SO ON WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STRESS SYSTEM AND THE SALT CRAVING SYSTEM AND WHY THOSE TWO SYSTEMS INTERACT AND WHY FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO MAY SUFFER A BIT FROM ANXIETY OR UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS INCREASING SALT IN TAKE PROVIDED S DONE THROUGH HEALTHY MEANS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE BENEFICIAL WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT CONDITIONS IN WHICH INCREASING SALT IN TAKE MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL FOR OFFSETTING LOW BLOOD PRESSURE AND SOME OF THESE POSTURAL SYNDRUMS THAT CAN LEAD PEOPLE TO DIZZINESS AND SO FORTH THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE EXPLORED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND OF COURSE HAVE TO BE EXPLORED WITH THE SUPPORT OF YOUR DOCTOR I MENTION THE SALT FIX WHICH I THINK IS AN INTERESTING REED KEEPING IN MIND THAT ALLOTT OF THE INFORMATION AND THERE RUNS COUNTER TO THE TYPICAL NARRATIVE THAT YOU HEAR AROUND SALT BUT NONE THE LESS HAS SOME VERY INTERESTING POINTS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER AND OF CERTAINLY WILL BROUGD IN YOUR VIEW OF THE HISTORY OF AND THE APPLICATIONS OF SALT AS IT RELATES TO A GREAT NUMBER OF HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE METRICS WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE PERCEPTION OF SALT MEANING THE PERCEPTION OF SALTY TASTES AND HOW THE PERCEPTION OF SALTY TASTE AND THE PERCEPTION OF OTHER TASTE LIKE SWEET CAN INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER TO DRIVE THINGS LIKE INCREASED SUGAR IN TAKE WHEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT AND INDEED HOW THE COMMINATION OF SALTING AN SWEET TASTES CAND BISE YOU TOWARDS CRAVING MORE FOR INSTANCE PROCESS FOODS AND WHY THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING TO AVOID AND OF COURSE WE TALKED ABOUT SALT AND ITS CRITICAL ROLE IN THE ACTION POTENTIAL THE FUNDAMENTAL WAY IN WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AT ALL SO MI HOPE FOR YOU IN LISTENING TO THIS EPISODE IS THAT YOU CONSIDER A QUESTION AND THAT QUESTION IS WHAT SALT IN TAKE IS BEST FOR YOU AND THAT YOU PLACE THAT QUESTION IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR FLUID INTAKE YOU PLACE THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DIET YOUR FOLLOWING THE AMOUNT OF CAFFIN YOU MIGHT BE INJESTING AND THE DIRETIC EFFECTS OF CAFFINE AND CRUCIALLY THAT YOU PLACE THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ELECTROLITES MORE GENERALLY MEANING SODIUM PATACIUM AND MAGNESIUM SOME DAY THERE WILL BE AN ONLINE PROGRAM OR AN AP I IMAGINE WHERE ONE COULD PUT A PUNCH OF DIFFERENT PARAMETERS IN ABOUT YOU KNOW THEIR PARTICULAR HEALTH STATAS I THEIR PARTICULAR DIET THEIR PARTICULAR EXERCISE AT CETERA MAYBE T WOULD ALL BE RUN BY A I ALGARITHEM OR SOMETHING WHERE IT WOULD MONITOR ALL THAT FOR US AND THEN IT WOULD SPIT OUT FOR US A PRECISE AMOUNT OF SODIUM THAT WE SHOULD TAKE IN EACH DAY UNFORTUNATELY NO SUCH TOOL OR DEVICE EXISTS RIGHT NOW AND SO ALL OF US HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTAIN OF SODA MEN TAKE FOR OURSELVES AND THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN THESE UNDER THESE CONTEXTUAL CONSIDERATIONS WHO KNOWS MAY BE ONE OF YOU WILL DESIGN SUCH AN AP OR SUCH A DEVICIHE I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IF NOTHING ELSE TO DAY'S DISCUSSION OUGHT TO ILLUMINATE THE FACT THAT SOME STRICT RECOMMENDATION OF SALT IN TAKE CANNOT BE MADE UNIVERSALLY ACROSS THE BOARD FOR EVERYBODY THERE'S A SIMPLY NO WAY THAT COULD BE THAT COULD BE DONE AND YET I THINK MOST OF WHAT WEV LEARNED ABOUT SALT IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSIONS AROUND HEALTH ARE THAT AT ITS THIS EVIL SUBSTANCE NOTHING COAN BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SUBSTANCE OUR PHYSIOLOGY ITS DEPENDENT ON IT OUR COGNITION IS DEPEND ON DEPENDENT ON IT INDEED OUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN OUR PERFORMANCE IN ESSENTIALLY ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE IS DEPENDENT ON IT AND I HOPE IHAVE BEEN ABLE TO ILLUMINATE SOME OF THE BEAUTIFUL WAYS IN WHICH THE BRAIN AND THE BODILY ORGANS INTERACT IN ORDER TO HELP US REGULATE THIS THING THAT WE CALL SODIUM BALANTS AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NURUNS IN OUR BRAIN THAT ARE BOTH TUNED TO THE LEVELS OF SALT IN OUR BODY AND POSITION IN A LOCATION N IN THE BRAIN THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DETECT THE LEVELS OF SALT IN OUR BODY AND TO DRIVE THE INTAKE OF MORE OR LESS SALT AND MORE OR LESS FLUID AND OTHER ELECTROLITES RELEGIOUS POINTS TO THE BEAUTY OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ALL EVOLVED THAT ALLOWS US TO INTERACT WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS ACCORDING TO THE CONTECT OF OUR DAILY AN ON GOING LIFE IF YOUR LEARNING FROM AND OR

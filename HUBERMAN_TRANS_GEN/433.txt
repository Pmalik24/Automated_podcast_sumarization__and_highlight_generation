WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAPODCA SCIENCE SCIENCEPACETO R ING I'M ANDREW HUBERMEN AND OR PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS JOCKO WILLINK JOKO WILLINK IS A RETIRED NAVY SEAL AND AUTHOR OF NUMEROUS IMPORTANT BOOKS ON LEADERSHIP AND TEAM DYNAMICS AND THE HOST OF THE JOCCO PODCAST DURING HIS TWENTY YEAR CAREER WITH THE US NAVY JOKO SERVED WITH SEAL TEAM THREE AS COMMANDER OF TASK UNIC BRUISER IN RHOMADIIRAC AND ELSEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE LEAST AS WELL AS DEPLOYMENTS IN ASIA AND EUROPE AFTER RETIRING FROM THE NAVY JOKO USED HIS EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE GLEANED FROM HIS TIME IN THE SEAL TEAMS AS A WAY TO DEVELOP TOOLS THAT ANYBODY CAN USE TO DEVELOP THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS BOTH FOR LEADING THEMSELVES AND FOR LEADING OTHERS THAT TOOK THE FORM OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT BOOKS THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND IS ENTITLED EXTREME OWNERSHIP HOW U S NAVY SEALS LEAD AND WIN HE IS ALSO AUTHORED SEVERAL BOOKS FOR KIDS ABOUT LEADERSHIP PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND HOW TO NAVIGATE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF LIFE I'VE READ BOTH EXTREME OWNERSHIP AND THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR KID AND I FOUND THEM TO BE IMMENSELY USEFUL IN TERMS OF ACTIONABLE IMFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF ONE SELF AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE WORKPLACE TYPICALLY GUESS ON THE HUBRMAN LABPODCAST ARE SCIENTISTS AND OR CLINITIONS IT WAS SOME TIME AGO THAT I WAS A GUEST ON THE JOCO PODCAST AND DURING THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION ON HIS PODCAST WE QUICKLY REALIZE THAT MANY OF THE SCIENCE SPACE TOOLS THAT MY LABORATORY HAS FOCUSSED ON AND THAT I'VE USED OVER THE YEARS AND SHARED ON THE HUBERUMAN LAB PODCAST HAD DIRECT OVERLAP AND PARALLEL WITH MANY OF THE TOOLS THAT JOKO AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SEAL TEAMS HAD ARRIVED AT INDEPENDENTLY THAT IS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNDERLYING SCIENCE AND IN FACT HE HAD MANY MORE TOOLS THAT HE HAD INCORPORATED DURING HIS YEARS IN THE SEAL TEAMS AS WELL AS IN BUSINESS LEADERSHIP IN FAMILY AND ELSEWHERE IN LIFE THAT I QUICKLY REALIZE IT WOULD BE AN ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE CONVERSATION TO HAVE HIM ON THIS PODCAST IN ORDER TO SHARE THOSE TOOLS WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE WE DISCUSSED NUMEROUS TOOLS THAT JOCO HAS TAUGHT AND USED OVER THE YEARS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONTECTS INCLUDING TOOLS FOR GENERATING MORE PHYSICAL ENERGY AND FOR GENERATING MORE FOCUS AND COGNITIVE ENERGY AND FOR NAVIGATING STICKING POINTS THAT IS HOW TO DEAL WITH LACK OF MOTIVATION HOW TO DEAL WITH DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIPS IN THE WORK PLACE AND ELSEWHERE ND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW TO THINK ABOUT AND NAVIGATE THE SELF IN FACT WE SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS NOTION OF THE SELF AND ONCE SELF IDENTITY AND HOW SELF IDENTITY PLAYS INTO OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIONS OF SPECIFIC TYPES CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME WHERE IT CAN HOLD US BAC HOW TO GAIN BETTER PERSPECTIVE ND HOW TO HELP OTHERS GAIN BETTER PERSPECTIVE SO THAT WE CAN WORK BETTER WITH THEM AND THEM WITH US WE ALSO GO DEEP INTO THE LIKELY SCIENTIFIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING WHY THE TOOLS THAT JOCO TEACHES AND USES ARE SO EFFECTIVE IN FACT ONETHING THAT YOU'LL IMMEDIATELY NOTICE IS THAT JOKO WAS WRITING THINGS DOWN AND I WAS WRITING THINGS DOWN THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION AND THAT JUST REFLECTS THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT JUST AN IMMENSELY POWERFUL TEACHER HE'S ALSO A PRACTITIONER AND AN AVID LEARNER HE'S ALWAYS SEEKING KNOWLEDGE SO WE KICK BACK AND FORTH OUR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT LIKELY DOES AND DOES NOT UNDERLY DIFFERENT TOOLS IN TECHNIQUES FOCASSING OF COURSE MOSTLY ON WHAT WORKS IN THE PRACTICAL SENSE IN THE WORLD WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE THANKS TO JOCO'S IMMENSE GENEROSITY AND CURIOSITY YOU WILL COME AWAY WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF TOOLS AND MUCH RICHER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO NAVIGATE AND INHANTS MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE BEFORE YOU BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH

THANKSTRAVEMYMAN I'M SUPEREXCITED AND SUPERHAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE IM GLAD TO BE HERE I KNOW THAT YOU AND I DID FIVE AND A HALF HOURS ON MY PODCAST SO ASCHEDUL IS CLEAR LET'S GO LET'S GO AND ACTUALLY AND PEOPLE W SEE THE JOCO GO DRINKS A THIS IS NOT SOME SORT OF PROMOTIONAL BY ME BUT THESE ARE THAT THE ENERGY DRINKS I DRINKS O THIS COULD BE I CALLED THE BRING YOUR OWN GO HODCAST AM IT IS THE ENERGY DRINK I DRINK AND NO I'M NOT TOLD TO PROMOTE THAT OR PAID TO PROMOTE THAT JUST THE ONE THAT I DRINK SO THERE OGO IM NOPUN INTENDED I WAS JUST SAYING TO OUR PRODUCER A MOMENT AGO THAT RARELY DO I SIT DOWN INTO A P ODCAST OR SOMEBODY THAT SKILLED IN PODCASTING LEK REEMEN WOULD BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT I'VE HAD ON THIS PODCAST IMBLYVE WHO'S ALSO OF PODCASTER SINCE YOU'RE A PODCAST R MANY OTHER THINGS I CONFESS ONM A LITTLE BUT INTIMIDATED WELL IT'S A WEIRD THING TO ACTUALLY CALL A SKILL BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT I JUST KIND OF START OF DOIN IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST KIND OF START OF DOING IT' SOMETHING THAT LECKS JUST KIND OF START OF DOING AND I NEVER PRACTISED IT I DIDN'T SIT DOWN BEFORE MY FIRST PODCAST AND THINK ABOUT HOW I SHOULD DELIVER THINGS I JUST KIND OF DID IT SO MAYBE IT'S US LOCK MORE THAN SKILL WELL YOU AND I I SHOULD GO BACK FURTHER THAN THAT CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD ON YOUR PODCAST THINK IT MIGHT AVE BEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND YOU WERE ON THE TIM FARREST PODCAST AND THE TIME I WAS LIVING WITH MY GIRL FRIEND WEHAD MOVED FROM SANDIAGO TO THE BAAREA RE LIVING THIS LITTLE TINY APARTMENT AND A BASEMEN IN OKLIN TRIND TO SAVE UP BY A PLACE BUT RENT OF PLACE THAT WAS DECENT TO LIVE IN AND WE BOTH KNEW A LOT OF TEAM GUIS SHEU KNEW MORE CIM GUIS THAN I DID IN SANDIEGO A DAYTED A FEW TIS TO BE DIRECT I'M GREAT WOMAN DOS GAS WERE COOL TO ME IMOSTLY AND IM IREMEMBER WHEN I SAW THE PHOTO ON THE TOP CARD FOR TIM'S PODCAST WOAS IT WAS YOUR FACE I SAID DO YOU KNOW THIS GY FROM SANDION SHE AS NOTE BUT IF YOU HAD TO DRAW A NAVY SEAL THAT'S WHAT YOU DRAW SO I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU EMBODY THE'RE NOTION OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS SOME OF WHICH YOU TALK ABOUT BUT SOME OF WHICH WHEN YOU OPEN UP A BIT AND REALLY GET SPECIFIC ABOUT WORK IN THE MILITARY AND WORK IN DAILY LIFE AND WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU BUT REALLY WHAT IS TO BE A HUMAN BEING SOME IMPORTANT CONTRADICTIONS ALSO REMURGED RIGHT IVESEE DISCIPLINE AS A FHENE THAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH YOU IT IN MY VIEW AND I THINK IN THE VIEW OF A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU EMBODY DISCIPLINE SO TO DAY I DEAFLY WANT O TALK ABOUT ROUTINES BUT ALSO MIND SETS BUT ALSO THINGS THAT YOU DO AND WAYS IT YOU APPROACH THINGS THAT MIGHT I'M NOT CONTRADICT BUT NOT BE SO OBVIOUS TO PEOPLE MIGHT IM BE A LUBIT COUNTER INTOITIVE AND IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS YOUR LIFE IN DITION O RUNNING BUSINESS IS YOU'R A FAMILY MAN YOU'VE CHILDREN AND MARRIED A LONG TIME AND IT'S YEU HVE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE FROM DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF LIFE SO WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO DIVE INTO ALL OF THEM OVER THE NEXT TWENTY SIX HOURS LET'S DIVE GREAT I'M FASCINATED BY THIS IDEA OF SENSE OF SELF I FEEL LIKE ALL OF US CAN LOOK BACK TO A TIME EARLY IN LIFE WHEN WE FIRST HAD SOME EXPERIENCE I' COULD BE I IN ART CLASS COULD BE FISHING COULD BE SPORT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I'M WHAT THE EXACT EXPERIENCE WAS BUT WHERE WE FIRST REALIZE THAT THER'RE REALLY COOL THINGS IN THE WORLD LIKE SOMETHING I TURNED US ON AT THE LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT OR MAYBE SCARED US OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION OF SUCH AN EVENT MAY BE NOT THE FIRST ONE BUT YOU VE REMEMBER HEARING OR SEEING SOMETHING AS A YOUNG KID AND MAYBEU COULD TELL US HOW YOUNG AND JUST THINKING YOUMORE OF THAT PLEASE  A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS ALONG TH THIS LINE OF LIKE WHEN WAS THERE A MOMENT RIGHT WHEN WAS THERE A MOMENT THAT YOU REALIZED DISCIPLINE OR WHEN WAS THERE A MOMENT YOU REALIZED LEADERSHIPPER WHEN WAS THERE A MOMENT YOU REALIZED DETACHMENT KIND OF LIKE THE QUESTIONER WHEN WHEN WAS THERE A MOMENT YOU REALIZED FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY SAYING IT I'M A PERSON RIHTE UM UP MAMA I'M A PERSON WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS AND I CAN MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND FOR ME ALL THOS ANSWERS ARE USUALLY FAIRLY GRADUALE YOU KNOW THERE'S LIKE A LITTLE THING THAT INDICATES YOU GET A CLUE AND THEN YOU MOVE A TLA BIT FURTHER DOWN THAT ROAD THAN YOU GET ANOTHER CLUE AND YOU MOVE A ITLA BIT FURTHER DOWN THAT ROAD ANDYOU GET ANOTHER CLUE A SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY FOR ME LIFE WAS LIKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID I WAS KIND OF SLOWLY DISCOVERING THAT I WAS A PERSON I WAS A HUMAN I REMEMBER U MY MOM TOOK ME SHOPPING I I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD AND I NEEDED TO GET PANTS FOR SCHOOL AND MY MOM TOOK ME SHOPPING AND WHEN I WENT TO INTO THE STORE THERE WAS A GIRL THAT WAS I N'T KNOW WHA THE'RE CALLED IN A STORE A RETAL SALES GIRL SHE'S PROBLY ABOUT SIXTEEN AND I STARTED CHATTING HER UP RIGHT AND AND I KIND OF RECOGNIZE IT A LITTLE BIT BUT I SORT OF DIDN'T TO AND I JUST WAS CHATIN OF THIS GIRL AND I WAS MAKING A LAUGH I WAS HAPVEN A GOOD TIME WITH THE WHOLE THING AND YOU' T PUTTIN ON THE PANTS AND SPINNING AROUND LIKE AND SHE WAS LAUGHING AND I REMEMBER EN WE LEFT THE STORE WITH THE PANTS AND MY MOM WAS SORT OF TALKING TO ME ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHAT WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO TO THAT GIRL IAS I WAS THINKING MYSELF WELL I KIND OF LIKE O THAT GIRL SHE WAS PRETTY I WHY THAT POPPED INTO MY HEAD BUT I JUST REMEMPERTHINGIN EY BEN THERE'S THE WHOLE WORLD OUT THERE AND I LET'S GO MAKE IT HAPPEN Y IT'S A GREAT STORY CAUSE IT I THINK IT REALLY SPEAKSIS A THING THAT YOU MENTION WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE FIRST START TO RALIZE WE HAVE A SENSE OF SELF IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH CAUSING EFFECT ON THE WORLD LIKE WE CAN HAVE AN IMPACT IN SOME WAY ONT ON THINGS OUTSIDE OF US OUTSIDE OF OUR HOME YOI LATELYHA BIN READING A LOT OF PSYCHOLOGY AND I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO SOME MERE CONTENT AND I I DEUST LEY WANT TO TALK YOU ABOUT A STUDY THAT YOU COVERED I RELATE TO THESE I'M IT'S A BRUTAL EXPERIMENT WITH THESE KIDS THAT EITHER HAD STUTTER OR DIDN'T HAVE STUTTER I WANT TO GET INTO TA LOBIT LATER BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE AN HOW A WE RECEIVED FEE BACK AND GIVE E BACK HAS A BIG IMPACT BUT I THINK SOME OF THAT HAPPENED JUST IN  OWN RELATIONSHIP TO THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT THE OLD A HUNGARIAN PSYCHOLOGISTS I'M LEARNING HAV THIS IDEA OF TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE THEY LERALLY THOGHT THERE WERE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE THERE ARE GENERATORS AND PROJECTORS AND GENERATORS ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE THEY REALIZE THEY CAN IMPACT OTHER PEOPLE POSITIVELY NEGATIVELY AND THEY THEY WONT CREATE THINGS IN THE WORLD THEY WANT TO GENERATE STUFF AND I CA WHILE I CAN ACHA BUILD STUFF AND BREAK STUFF AND BLOW STUFF UP MAYBE BUT ALSO YOU KNOW HELP THINGS AND AND THEN THEY'RE THESE PROJECTORS THAT LIKE TO JUST KIND OF REFLECT ON WHAT THEY SEE AND THEY MADE THE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT I THINK THAT IT'S NOT THE GENERATORS ARE GOOD IN PROJECTORS ARE BAD THE WORLD NEEDS BOTH THAT THEY REALLY WORK IN A KIND OF SYMBIOTIC WAY BUT YOUR STORY CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A GENERATOR WHICH IS THAT BY DOING CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN HAVE AN IMPACK AND IT FEEDS BACK TO YOU AND IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY RECEIVE SOMETHING FROM IT AS WELL YE AND WHERE THIS ALL CAME TO FRUITION AS I AS I NOW PIECE TOGETHER AS YOURE TALKING THROUGH THE STUFF LOOK WHEN I JOIN THE MILITARY YOU JOIN THE MILITARY AND YOU GET A BLANK SLAT SO NO ONE CARES WHERE YOU CAME FROM NO ONE CARES WHAT YOU DID YOU WERE THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM CAP ON THE SOCRATINE KDOWN CARES DON CARES WHAT YOUR GRADES WERE NO ONE CARES WHAT YOU GOT ON THE ESSAY TEAS OR AND DON'T CARES ABOUT ANYTHING YOU'RE A BLANK SLATE AND THEN WITH THAT BLANK SLATE IT IS HEY IF YOU DO THIS THING IF YOU PERFORM THIS TASK AND YOU PERFORM IT WELL YOUILL GET RECOGNITION YOU ILL GET YOU'LL HOPEFULLY GET MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR OWN DESTINY WHICH IS THE ULTIMATE IN COMPENSATION FOR FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR OWN DESTINY IS THE ULTIMATE COMPENSATION YOU DON'T YOU AND I WERE TALKING BEFORE IT RECORD LIKE YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD BUT IF YOU DON'T CONTROL WHAT YOU'RE DOING EVERY DAY OR AT LEAST YOU DON'T CONTROL MOST OF WHAT YO'RE DOING TIS THAN IT'S NOT WORTH IT THE RECENT PEOPLE TRYIN MAKE MONEY SO THEY CAN HAVE MORE AUTONOMY IN THEIR LIFE AND SO IN THE MILITARY IT BECOMES VERY CLEAR AN IT BECAME VERY CLEAR TO ME VERY QUICKLY THAT IF I PERFORMED WELL I ACTUALLY GOT A LOT MORE FREEDOM WITH WHAT I DID EVEN IN BOOT CAMP YOU KNOW IF YOU PASS AN INSPECTION IN BOOT CAMP YOU DON'T HAVE TO REDO YOU'RE LOCKER OR YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE YOUR BED AGAIN BECAUSE YOU DID IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME AND SO YU HAVE AN EXTRA FIFTEEN MINUTES AND AND SO FOR ME REALLY THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO REALIZE OH WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW ISN'T GOITO IMPACT NOT ONLY WHAT'S CAN HAPPENTO BE IN THE NEXT HOUR BUT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS AND I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST MISS THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE'RE GROWING UP AND I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR CHALLENGEES AND TRIBULATIONS AS YOU WERE GROWING UP BECAUSE YOU DIDN' REALIZE OH WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS GAN EFFACT WHERE I'M GIN TO BE IN THE FUTURE AND IT DIDN'T CAPPEN UNTIL YOU WERE OUT A HIGH SCHOO WHEN YOU WENT TO YUN YOUR COLLEGE AND YOU LIKE IL WAIHT A SECOND I CAN ACTILLY PUT MY LIFE TOGETHER IN A POSITIVE WAY WHEN YOU'RE FOURTEEN YOU'RE THINKING HAYWONOMEN TO DO TOMORROW THAT'S PISTICALLY FUTURE OPERATIONS OR OTTEIN ON ATOUR HEADS TO MORR ORT AND I'S LIKE WEARES WHERE MI CAN GET THE SELLAR BE WISH CURVES IN MIG IN AHEAD SCAPE WORDING AND WHERE WE DON'T PLAY THE DIO GAMES TO NIGHT OR WHAT GIRLS ARE GENTO HANG OUT THAT WAS KIND OF THE MIND SAT IT FOR YE AND THEN AT SOME POINT YOU YOU LEARNED AND SO DID I OH THE WAY THE THE THE ACTIONS THAT I TAKE NOW OR EITHER GINGTO POSITIVELY IMPACK MY FUTURE F THERE CAN NEGTIVELY AND PACK MY FUTURE AND THE THE THE MORE I FOCASSED ON DOING THINGS HARE NOT POSITIVELY IM PACK MY FUTURE THE BETTER MY LIFE BECAME I THINK THAT'S A VERY HUGE LESSON TO LEARN THAT I KNOW I DIDN'T FIGURE OUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME AT THE IDEA O INVESTMENTS IN WITHDRAWLS RUNDERSTANDING THAT EARLY IN LIFE INTERMS OF HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND INTELLECTUAL BEHAVIORS AND AND YOUR POIN ABOUT THE MILITARIES ARE REALLY INTERESTING WHEN I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE MILITARY THAT WAY THAT THERE'S IS BLANK SLATE WHEN YOU GET IN THERE A AND BEFORE WE STARTED WE'RE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE KINDS OF MINDSETS AND PEOPLE THAT THE MILITARY ATTRACTS AND A LEFEU TO ELABORATE ON THAT AGAIN YOU MENTION ON SOMETHING INTERESTING THIS S NOTION OF GARRISON INTERESTING WORD IN ITS OWN RIGHT AM WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO YOU THING TO MILITARY ATTRACTS AND THEN WITHIN THE MILITARY YOU START TO SEE SOME KIND OF PREDICTABLE BIFRICATIONS WHERE CERTAIN PEOPLE GO DOWN ONE TRACK AND OTHER PEOPLE GO DOWN ANOTHER I'VE A FEW FRIENDS FROM THE SEAL TEAMS IS AS WE BOTH KNOW AND I'VE HEARD SOMETIMES ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICERS AND ENLISTED GUISE THIS KIND OF THING BUT MAYBE THIS QUESTION O'M ASKING IS WERE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL OF MILITARY AND FOR A REALLY FOR PEOPLE LISTENING WHETHER NOT THEY ARE INTERESTIN MILITARY OR NOT FOR THEIR OWN FOR THEIR OWN LIFE I THN THERE'S AN INTERESTING LESS IN THIS IDEA WHO IS ATTRACTED TO THE MILITARIES IT LIKE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO IN STILL ORDER ON THEMSELVES OR IS IT PEOPLE ANT AN STIL ORDER ON OTHER PEOPLE WE'RE BOTH YOTHER'S THERE'S A A REALLY GOOD BOOK AND I DID I AINT UP DOING ABOUT FOUR PODCASTS ON THIS BOOK WHICH IS CALLED THE PSYCHOLOGY OF  MILITARY INCOMPETENCE WHEN I FIRST SAW THON A MANZING TITLE I KNOWN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT TITLE I THOUGHT TO MYSELF ALL YOU KNOW THIS IS SOME SOME ACADEMIC THAT'S GOING TO LOOK AT THE MILITARY AN BASH IT AND BUT I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH IN IT TURNED OUT WIT THE GUI THAT HAD WRITTEN THE BOOK I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME OR NOW YOU WAS A GUIDE THAT HAD SERVED IN WORLDWARD TO WAS WOUNDED AN MING THE SGUY HAD THIS COUND ER SO WA YO WARE TALKING ABOUT AND IT'S REALLY AN OBVIOUS CONCEPT ONT YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND HIS BASE THE BASIC PREMISIS THIS THE MILITARY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IT'S THIS ORDERLY PLACE IT'S A PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING HAS A PLACE IT'S A A PLACE WHERE IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN RANK ON YOUR SHOULDER YOU WILL COMMAND RESPACT AND PEOPLE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE SO IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE AN AUTHORITARY IN MIND SET FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT O JUST HAT DON'T DON'T DON'T QUESTION WHAT I'M SAYING JUST SHUT UP ANDOWHAT I TELL YOU DO THERES PEOPLE THAT LOVE THAT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT WANT TO LIVE LIKE THAT YOU'VE WORKED FOR THEM I'VE WORKED FOR THEM WE'VE WE'VE EXPERIENCE THAT THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT OUR L TS THAT AUTHORITARY MINDS THAT THAT JUST WANT TO BARK ORDERS AND HAVE PEOPLE LISTEN TO THEM AND SO WHEN THEY WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE FOURTEEN YEARS OLD OR SIXTEEN YEARS OLD OR EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD THEY LOOK AT THE MILITARY AND THEY SEE A UNIFORM AND THEY SAY PEOPLE SALUTING AND THEY SEE ORDERS BEING CARRIED OUT AND THEY THINK THAT'S WHERE I AM GOING TO GO AND I CAN GET THE RESPECT ATITE TO SERVE AND THE MILITARY CERTAINLY ATTRACTS PEOPLE LIKE THAT AND THOSE PEOPLER THAT HAVE THAT HIGHLY DISCIPLINED AND ORDERLY MIND SET CAN DO WELL INSIDE THE MILITARY ESPECIALLY IN GARRISON AND I HAD TO WEE GAN WE'RE TOK ABOUT THIS EARLY OF THE WORD GARRISON I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CIVILIAN EQUIVALENT TO THIS WORD BUT IT BASICALLY MEANS THE NON COMBAT SITUATION SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT ON THE PARADE FIELD WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SCHOOLING WHERE THERE'S NO COMBAT INVOLVED WHEN YOU'RE MARCHING LIKE THOSE KIND OF THINGS WWE CALL THAT GARRISON IT'S IN THE REAR IT'S NOT IN COMBAT AND THE PEOPLE WITH AN AUTHORITARY MINDS THAT ACTUALLY DO PRETTY WELL IN GARRISON SITUATIONS WHY BECAUSE THINGS ARE ORDERLY AND YOU CAN PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU DO GET A CERTAIN ISSUE OF GEAR AND THAT GEARIS GOING TO BE DELIVERED ON TIME AND YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT THIS NUMBER OF ROUNDS DOWN AT THE RANGE AND EVERYTHING IS GOING TO GO ACCORDING TO PLAN THAT'S WHAT GARRISON IS AND SO THOSE PEOPLE JOIN THE MILITARY THEIR ATTRACTIV THAT AND THEYAN'T UP DOING WELL IN PEACE TIME NOW UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM COMBAT IS A LOT DIFFERENT NOTHING GOES THE WAY IT SPOSE TO GO THE BULLETS DON'T GET DELIVER ON TIME THE ENEMY HAS A VOTE ON THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING TO UNFOLD AND YOU WENT UP IN COMBAT IN BEING VERY CHAOTIC SITUATIONS SO THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT THRIVES IN COMBAT HAS A MORE OPEN MIND HAS A MORE FLEXIBLE MIND IS PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE IN PUT THAT THE'RE RECEIVING A SUPPOSE THE SOME ONE OF THE AUTHORITAR MINDSTHAT THEY DON'T LISTEN ANYBODY ELSE THEY  MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND THEY BARK ORDERS WITH SOME ONE THAT HAS A MORE OPEN MIND SET THEY'RE LISTENING THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING IN PUT THEY'RE EVOLVING THEY'RE PLAN AND THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE EXCELL IN A COMBAT SITUATION NOW UNFORTUNATELY AND'S A SORT OF THE STEREOTYPE TOO YOU TAKE THAT THAT DOG OF WAR AND YOU PUT HIM BACK INTO A GARRISON INVIROMENT HE DOESN'T DO WELL RIGHT HE'S NOT SHOWING UP ON TIME FROM THE INSPECTION HE DOESNT HAVE HIS HE DOESN'T GET GEN GET HIS HAIR CUT HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS WEAPON CLEAN THE WAY IT'XPPOSE TO BE CLEAN CAUSE HE'S GOT HIS WEAPON READY FOR COMBAT NOT READY FOR INSPECTION AND AND SO YOU GET THIS THERE THERE ARE THES TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE AND OF COURSE WITH THOSE TWO DIFERENT TYPES PEOPLE TOS DEGREES GOING ONE DIRECT IONOTHER BUT WHAT YOU HOPE FOR IS SOME ONE THAT CAN PLAY THE GAME ON THE GARRISON SIDE AND YET WHEN IT COMES TIME TO GOINTO COMBAT THEY CAN ALSO OPEN THEIR MIND BE FLEXIBLE BE CREATIVE THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IS YOU WANT SOME ONE THAT IS TVERY GOOD AT SOLVING PROBLEMS AND TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A CREATIVE OPEN MIND TO FIGURE HOW WEREGNGTO DO WITH SOMETHING SO I THINK THAT'S A STEREO TYPE THE STEREO TYPE IS THAT EVERYONE IN THE MILITARY IS SORT OF ROBOTIC AND FALLING INTO THE HIERARCHY AND WE BARK ORDERS AND PEOPLE FALL ORDERS AND THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF TRUTH TO IT BUT IS NOT THE WHOLE TRUTH AND CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT IT HISTORY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT EXCELL AND COMBAT ARE THE PEOPLE THAT MAY BE HAVE A LITTLA BIT OF A REBELLIOUS STREEK PEOPLE THAT HAVE ATHAT THAT ARE JUST MORE CREATIVE AND MORE OPEN MINDED SOME OF MY FRIENDS FROM THE SEAL TEAMS A WILL SOMETIMES THROW OUT STEREATYPES ABOUT THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS IN THE MILITARY IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW ARFORCE TYPES ARE ONE WAY AND MARINES ARE ONE WAY AND O NAVY IS ONE WAY ARMYIS A CERTAIN WAY LIKE SORT OF A GENERAL CONTOUR PERSONALLY OR IS THAT JUST KIND OF INSIDE BALL JOKING AROUND IT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOTH I MEAN CERTAINLY THE MARINE CORPS IS STEEPED IN TRADITION AND YOU  IF YOU IF YOU MAKE A GUESS AT WHAT A MARINE WENT WEN IF YOU MEET OR IF YOU HAD A HAD TO GUESS WHAT A MARINES ON TO BE LIKE YOU YOU PROGING ME PRETTY CLOSE I MEAN MARINES HAVE A INCREDIBLE PROGRAMME TO IN DOCTRINEATE THEYRE PEOPLE INTO THE CULTURE OF THE MRINCOR AND THE MRINCOR HASN'T INCREDIBLY STRONG CULTURE O POWERFUL CULTURE I LOVE THE RINCRIVE WORK WITH THE RINKCOR A TON AND THEY'RE OUTSTANDING AS A GENERALITY CERTAINLY YOU COULD MAKE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE MARINE'S GENERAL TA NOW DAS TI MEAN THAT EVERYMERINEISTHE SAME NOW ABSOLY NOT SAMETHING WITH THE ARMY SAMETHING WITH THE AIRFORCE SAMETHING WITH THE NAVY YOU'VE GOT THESE KIN OF STEREO TYPES THAT EXIST FOR REASON A YOU NOIT'S INTERESTING TO IT'S ONE OF MY FRIENDS NAMED BEN MILIGAN WROTE WROTE AN INCREDIBLE BOOK CALLED BY WATER BENEATH THE WALLS WHICH I'VE GIVEN HIM A HUGE HOSTLE ABOUT BECAUS ITS THE WORST TITLE OF ALL TIME BUT IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY THE BEST BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT THE SEAL TEAMS HISTORY AND WHERE THE SEAL TEAMS CAME FROM AND AND IT'S INTERESTING IT SOMETHING THAT I HAD HEARD FROM A SEAL OFFICER THAT HAD GIVEN A SPEECH YEARS AGO IT IS CHANGE COMMAND WHAT HE SAID WAS HEY LISTEN YOU WAS TRYING TO EMPHASIZE WHY THE SEAL TEAMS WERE GOOD AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID WAS YOU KNOW IN IN THE ARMY YOUE TALKING ISTORICALLY WHO'S HAY IN THE ARMY IF YOU START TO LOSE A BATTLE YOU CAN JUST RETREAT RUN AWAY IN THE NAVY TRADITIONALLY WE'RE FIGHTING ON BOARD A SHIP AND IF THAT SHIP IF WE CAN'T RUN AWAY WE'RE FIGHTING IF WE LOSE WE DIE SO SEALS CAN'T QUIT THIS SORT OF THIS YOU KNOW LITTLE OVER THE TOP EXPRESSION BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THAT LITLE BIT FURTHER WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE NAVY IF YOURE YOUN IF WE WERE IN THE NAVY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO ON DEPLOYMENT YOU WOULD TAKE YOUR SHIP AND YOU WOULD SAIL SOMEWHERE AND YOU WOULN'T BE ABLE TO TALK TO MEANYG MORESO YOU WOULD HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS YOU ERE TRYING TO COMPLISH AND DIN'T YOU GO OUT THERE AND MAKE IT HAPPEN THAT'S DECENTRALIZED COMMAND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EXIST IN THE SEAL TEAMS WITHOUT QUESTION VERY DECENTIRALIZED COMMAND AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ONE THE ABSOLUTE STRENGTHS OF THE SAL TEMS IS YOU'VE GOT LEADERS AT EVERY LEVEL INSIDE THE ORGAIZATION THAT IF THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY FUT NOT TOLD WHAT TO DO THERE CAN A GO AKA I DON'T HAVE BEEN TOLD WITL DO BOMICA FIGURED OUT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THE SEL TEAMES WE DON'T WE ALSO WE HAVE MORE DOCTRINE NOW BUT WHEN I CAME IN THE SEAL TEMES THERE WAS NO DOCTRINE WAS ALL WORD OF MOUT AND SO THE ARMY IN THE RINKQUAR IF YOU HAVE TO CONDUCT AN AMBUSH YOU CAN PULL OUT O MANUEL AND YOU CAN LOOK UP HOW TO CONDUCT AN AMBUSH PLATOONE AMBUSH OW TO CONDUCTIT AND IT'S ALL WRITTEN VERY CLEAR AND AR GREAT DOCUNESSITS THE FEM SEVEN TACK EIGHT INFANTRY PLATUNE IN SQUAT I THINK IT'S THE IS THE ARMY DOCTRINE  SILL NERNS IN YOUR HYPPOCAMPUS FIRING AND YES IT'S IMBEDDED IND THERE FOREVER AND IT'S A AREAT MANUEL AND YOU CAN PULL THAT THING OUT AND YOU HAVE A PLACE TO START FROM IN THE SEAL TEAMS WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT AT ALL SO YOU WOULD HEAR FROM YOUR PLOTUNE CHIEF THIS IS HOW YOU CONDOCTRINE I AMBUSH AND HE HAD HEARD IT FROM HIS POTUNE CHIEF WHO HEARD IT FROM HIS POTUNE CHIEF WHO HEARD IT FROM HIS POTUNE CHIEF AND OPPORTUNE CHIEF WAS IN VE ATNOUT SO ITS GETTIN PASS DOWN BUT YOU CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO IT AND YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN ALTER THE PLAND A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE HEY THE TERRANE IS DIFFERENT OR HEY THE THE THE NIGHT VISION WE NOW HAVE SO THERE'S CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOCTRINE SO NOT HAVING ANY DOCTRINE IN MANY WAYS IS A STRENGTH ALSO IT CAN BE A WEAKNESS BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT A NEW PLATOUN COMMANDER THAT'S NEVER DONE A A AN AMBUSH BEFORE AND HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS DOING IS PLATUNE CHIEF HAS BEEN OUT OF LUTE FOR A LONG TIME AND HE DOES NOW WHAT HE'S DOING THERE'S NO WAY THER'S NO REFERENCE SO THERE'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKESS IS JUST LIKE ANY CHARACTERISTIC RIGHT EVERYBODY'S CHARACTERISIC YOUVE GOT STRENGTHAND YOU'VE GOT WEAKNESSES AND YOUR WEAKNESSES CAN BE STRENGTHTHAN YOU STRENGTH AN BE WEAKNESSES BUT TO GET BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION ARE THERE STEREO TYPES INSIDE OF EACH OF THE MILITARY BRANCES SURE BUT ARE THERE OUTLIERS IN EACH OF THE MILITARY BRANCHES THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER FOR PEOPLE TIS SAYING THIS WHO ARE NOT IN THE MILITARY MAYBE HAVE SOME MILITARY LINEYAGE IN THEIR FAMILY OR NOT BUT WHO WANT TO UNDERSTAND A  BUT BETTER ABOUT HOW STRUCTURE AND LACK OF STRUCTURE CAN BOAST SUPPORT BEING EFFECTIVE IN IN LIFE IN RELATIONSHIPS IN DAILY LIFE IN FITNESS IN BUSINESS IN SCHOOL I THING GOESE OF THE BIG DOMAINS IN CREATIVE ENDEAVORS THING NOLD BE USEFUL FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU IN PARTICULAR BALANCE DISCIPLINE INSTRUCTURE WITH DARE I SAY LACK OF DISCIPLINE INSTRUCTURE WOML YOU CAN ACTYYU TOS SAY THE WORD FREEDOM RIGHTCAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT TURNS OYE OR MADE EVEN PLAY IOU KNOW I BRING THIS UP IN PART BECAUSE I'VE SEEN SOME POST THAT YOU PUT UP OF YOU YOU'LL PLAINLAY GUITAR WITH FRIENDS OR MUSIC ONE OF THEM WAS ATTRIBUTE TO SU ONE WHO I EITHER WAS KILLED IN COMBATER IT PASSED AWAY SO YOU' THESE MOMENTS OF CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES AR WORKING TOGETHER BUT SOMETIMES ARE IN RELAXATION AND PLAY IN THESE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK IT AS A REALLY IMPORTANT POST FOR PEOPLE TO SEE THAT WHILE JOCKA WILLING KICKS BACK WITH A GUITAR NOT TRING TO TAKE OVER STAGES MAYBE YOU ARE MAYBE OF A PLAN THEN ING CAN DO YOU PILY BE THE ONE BUT WHAT IS THE BALANCE FOR YOU IN TERMS OF STRUCTURE AND LACK OF STRUCTURE AND I'M NOT AN ASK FOR YOUR DAILY ROUTINE WE KNOW THAT YOU GET UP EARLY YOU TRAIN BUT I DO AVE SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL IN PUTTING SOME MEAT ON THE THE KIND OF A THE NOTIONS ABOUT YOU AND AGAIN THIS ISN'T A PICKING TO YOUR LIFE BUT MORE TO TO GRAB WHA IT'S TO PICK INTO YOUR LIFE THE SO A QUESTION I ASKED YOU IN THE LOBBY AS IT'S ONE THAT YOU KNO HAVING SEEN IOUR CONTENT FOR A LONG TIME AND REALLY BENEFITED FROM IT I WAS CURIOUS YOU GET UP EARLY AT ABOUT FOR THIRTY TRAIN EVERY MORNING HOW LONG DO YOU TRAIN FOR AND IS THERE ANY GLOBAL STRUCTURE TO THAT AND OF COURSE EVERYONE NEEDS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BUT DOU IS IT LIKE WAIT TRAINING ONE DAY CARTIO TRAINING THE NEXT DAY OR YOU COMBINING THE AS ALWAYS AN HOURAS IT ALWAYS HALF AN HOUR I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR YOU WITH THE COF YAHT THAT EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS LEVELS OF YOU BACKGROUND ET CETERA BUT I'M INTENSELY CURIOUS ABOUT THIS AND I CERTAIN I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE SO YOU WANT TALK ABOUT WAIT LIFTING OR ROCK AND ROLL ON THE GUITAR I WANT TO TALK ABOUT EM LET'S YOUR LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOST STRUCTURED FIRST PARTY YOUR DAY AND THENLESS I'V BUT THE LEAST STRUCTURE PARTY YOUR DAY A LEAST OF THE PARTHY YOU CAN SHARE WITH THE WITH THE WORLD YET I WAKING UP EARLY AND I'M GOING TO WORK OUT AND DEPENDING ON WHAT'S GOING ON THAT DAY IF I HAVE AN EARLY FLIGHT I MIGHT WORK OUT FOR EIGHT MINUTES RIGHT I'M MIGHT GOING AND DO TWO THOUSAND METERS ON THE ROLLER GET GET A SWEAT GOING HARD AS I CAN AND THEN I'M DONE AND CAUSE I GOT T GO CATCH A FLIGHT SO THAT COULD BE HAPPENING MAYBE I'M SUPPOSED TO GO SURFING IN THE MORNING I WAKE UP THE WAVES ARE TERRIBLE AND SO NOW I'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO IF I'D PLANNED OUT YOU KNOW TO BE SERFING FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS AND NOW I'M NOCK TO GO SURFRING STON TO GO I'M TO GO LIFT THAN UNDER GO PLAYING THE JIM AND DO A BUNCH OF STUFF I MUS SPEND TWO OR THREE HOURS AN HER I LOVE DOING THAT SO THE WORK OUT COULD BE ANYWHERE BETWEEN WHAT I TO SAY EIGHT MINUTES AND THREE HOURS AND IT COULD BE ANYTHING I BETWEEN I I FULLY ENJOY THE THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF WORKING OUT SO IF I HAVE MORE TIME TO SPEND IN THE JIM I'LL SPEND IT I REMEMBER MY DAD SAYING AT ONE POINT IF I RETIRED I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I I I'LL THINK MYSELF OR YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW YOUR IF I DIDN'T HAVE AYTHING TO DO I'D SPEND SIX HOURS DAY IN THE JIM I'T SPEEN FOUR HOURS DOING YOU GITTO LIKE I COULD FILL MY DAY I COULD FILL EVERY DAY WITH JUST PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THINGS THAT I JUST LIKE DOING BUT THAT'S SO WAKE UP EARLY GET A SWAT GOING AND DO I LIFT YES DO I DO CARDIO YES DO I RUN YES O A SPRINT YES DO I LIFT HEAVY WAIGHTS YES THROU I SRING CATTLEBELLS YAS I AH I DO EVERYTHING AND AND ANYTHING AND I ENJOY ALL OF IT AND I'M NOT REALLY GOOD ANY OF IT THEY ARE NOT I'M NOT REALLY GOOD AT ANY ONE ASPECT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY I I THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE INFINITELY BETTER ME IN EVERY ASPECT OF AND AM MOT TOS TALK ABOUT OTHISGIES A WORLD CLASSLENON AND THERE'S LIKE A GUINDIN FRED DOWN THE GIM THAT CONDE LIF MORE THAN ME THERE'S A GUY WHEN I WAS IT FILTIN TOO THRE WAS A GUY WHO IS IWE FIVE SEVEN AND HE LOOK KIND OF SHOBBY AND HE WAS OLDER THAN ME AND HE COULD RUN FASTER THAN ME HE COULD BENCH MORE THEN OSGIS ER AT THERE IT WAS E SO BOTHERSOM YET THERE OUT THERE THEY IT THEY GOT SOME ENGINE IN THER RELATED TO SOMETHING A I DO THINK THER GENETIC DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF PEOPLES RASILIENTS AND WORK OUT BUT EVEN JIS GRIP STRENGTH IS HIGHLY UM HIHLY SUBJECT IS LIKE GENETIC INFLUENCE IS MAXIMUM GRIP STRENGTH BUT OF COURSE THERE'S A HUGE RANGE IN WHAT PEOPLE CAN DEVELOP BUT A GUARENTEE YOUR GRIP STRENGTH IS IS GREATER THAN MINE UEM PEOPLE AST ME THIS ALL THE TIME WHO OULD WIN N ARM WRESTLING BETWEN YOUR JOCGL MY JOCCO WHO AN INTRIGES OF JOCCO UNINISALON A TECHNIQUE AN ARM WRESTLING  I HAVE TO IMAGINE THEIRE PUTTING THEIR BODY BEHIND THE WEAS THERE'S ACTORS THA LIKE THERE'S LEGITIMATE TACHNIQUE IN AR WRESTLING THERE R FOR ME YET YET THERE'S NO LIKE IF WE COULD BRING A FEMALE ARM WRESTLING HERE THAT KNOWS HOW ARM WRESTLE BECAUSE I'M N A HAR ARM WRESTLE EITHER AND SHE WOULD BE BOTH OF US A BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A LOT MORE TACHNIQUE AN ARM WRESTLING THAN YOU KNOW THEN MOST PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THERE'S ALL THESE LITTLE GAMES THAT ARE GOING ON THERE'S ALL THIS LITTLE ARM POSITION THAT YOU GET SO JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IT'S TACHNIUEERE'S A LOT OF TECHNIQUE AN ARM WRESTLING LAT'S GOOD TO KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT ARM WRESTLING I THINK WE ALL START OFF WITH SOME GENETIC PREDIIUSPOSITIONS BOTH GOOD AND BAD FOR DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEN THERE'S AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE'S A HUGE RANGE BASE THROUGH NARRAL PLASTICITY AND MUSTLE ADAPTATION AT CETERA IN WHAT WE CAN OBTAIN SO NEVER ON GENETIC PREDISPOSITION A SERVE AS A BARRIER NO ONE KNOWS ALSO WHAT THE UPPER LIMITS OF ANY OF THESE THINGS ARE AND SOME OF THE BEST EXAMPLES WE KNOW FROM SPORTING CERTAINLY FROM ACED AMIA OUR PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEY WERE AT A DISADVANTAGE AND JUST WORKE TENTIMES HARDER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE THEY HAD AN AX TO GRIND WITH THEIR GUNETIC DISADVANTAGE WHICH IS REALLY COOLID AT THE FACE OF IT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED AG ONE IS A VITIMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATION ON NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THERE SPONSORING THE POD CAST THERE IS MY STORRY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE OUTHLTIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME IN THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OR GOD IS VERY IMPORTANT ATS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WIH THE BRAIN THE MUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIATICS ANATHLETIC GRENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITIO N I LET IT GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATION AL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE RIGHT IF YOU LIKE TO TRY OTH LET IT GREENS YOU CAN GO TO A LETT IT GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUMERMAN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP OUT LET TIT GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AND THE CAR ON THE PLAN ET CETERA AND THEY'L GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEM IN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S A LET IT GREENSTOCK CAM SLASH HUMERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YOUR SUPPLY OF VITE HIM IN D THREE K TO SO YOU GET YOU GET THE TRAINING AND DO TRACK YOUR TRAINING AND IN A DETAILED WAY AR YOU KEEP AT TRACK O LIFTS AND I SI RIGHT DOWN WHAT I DO AND I'LL RIGHT DOWN II RIGHT DOWN WHAT I DO EVERYDAY AND THAT WAY I CAN GO BACK AND SAY WHAT WAS I DOIN BACK THAN CAUSE I MIGHT GO THROUGH SOME PHASE WHERE I'M TRYING TO DO MORE POLUPS OR I'M TRYING TO DEAD LIFT MORE AND I'M TRYING OR WHAT T WHATEVER THE WHATEVER THE THING IS I'LL GO BACK INTO GOTHE THET BOARD OF DED LIFTING AFTER WHILE LET'S FACE IT IF YOU JUST WANT TO BE A GOOD DEAD LIFTER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THAT FAST RIGHT YOU'RE YOU'RE GINGTO BE SLOW ON LONG RUNS SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TOO DEEP INTO DEAD LIFTING ANDYOU'LT ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE SO GOOD AT LONG RUNS THAT YOU CAN'T DEAD LIFT YOU KNOW GO A GOOD A MO WAI SO I GOT TO GO THROUGH PHASES NDNOT GETTINTO SOMETH FOR A WHILE NOT GETTINTO SOMETHING ELSE SO I DO LOG DOWN WHAT I'M DOING SO I CAN LOOK BACK AND SAY OH DAN YOU KNOW I I'M I'M NOTTEVEN CLOSE TO STRONGERS I USE TO BE ME TO GET BACK TO THAT I'M FASTENING BY THE CONCEPT OF ENERGY THINKS WHEN THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECTS AN ALL ABIOLOGEOL O PSYCHOLOGY AND ALL OF LIFE AND WHAT WHEN I SAY ENERGY I MEAN IM THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BEING BACK ON YOUR HEELS FLATFOOTED AND FORWARD CENTER OF MASS YOU KNOW AND I GET THE IMPRESSION AND I THINK EVERYONE GETS THE IMPRESSION TYOU'RE SOMEBODY WITH A LOT OF ENERGY AND I WONDER WHETHER OR NOT YOU WAKE UP WITH A LOT OF ENERGY AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO BURN IT OFF WITH THIS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND AND WORK AND OTHER DEMANDS IN YOUR LIFE WHERE DO YOU FIND THAT YOU WAKE UP AND YOUR ENERGY IS KIND OF NEUTRAL AND EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GIVES YOU ENERGY AS I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THA KEA THINGS OUT THERE I THINK THAT ACTS AS A BARRIER FOR PEOPLE DOING MORE WITH THEIR BODY BECAUSE THEY MAYBE THEY DN'T WANT TIRE THEMSELVES OUT OR MAY THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO BEGIN WITH IT'S ALSO FEEDS INTO THIS IDEA THAT OWYOU KNOW SOMEPEOPLE TO HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY THEYE REALLY PHYSICAL AND OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T SO ON BUT JU SAY ON MOST DAYS YOU WAKE UP FEELING LIKE YOU WANT TO BURN OFF ENERGY BUILD ENERGY WHAT IS EXERCISE MEAN TO YOU AND THER MAY WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF UNDERLYING STUFF GOING ON THIRCS I THINK BOTH MY FIND AND INTERESTING I WOULD SAY IT'S BOTH RIGHT THERE'S NOWAY ACOSIDERAN SAY OH YE EVERY DAY THAT ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF AND I'M LIKE OH YE LET'S ROCK AND O O CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE IT'S ALSO CERTAINLY NOP THE CASE AT EVERY DOW WY O GOD NOT AGET NOW I THAT' SAY MOST THE TIME THERE LARM CROCK GOES OFF AND I DON'T THINK UBUNCH LIKE WHEN MY LAR COCK GOES OFF I I CON'T I I DON'T THINK UBUNCH I DON'T DEBATE WITH MYSELF NOT NEGOTIATING I I JUST THING GOES OFF AND I'M DOI IN WHAT I'M SORSE TO DO SORT OF ROBOTIC NOW THIS THIS MUCH I CAN'T SAY WHEN YOU GO AND WORK OUT YOUR CAN FEEL BETTER YOU WI'LL GET ENERGY FROM WORKING OUT YOU THAT IS THAT IS A GUARANTY IF YOU GO WORK OUT YN FEEL BETTER IF YOU GO BREAK A SWIGGER CAN FEEL BETTER YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE ENERGY FROM IT AND LOOK YOU GOT A GO REALLY REALLY HORRD TO WERE NOW YOU FEEL MORE TIRED WHEN YOU'RE DONE AND EVEN THAT A'M YOU CON TA GO PCYCHO I'LL DO THAT OCCASIONALLY BUT I DON'T DO THAT ON A DAILY BASIS YOU'LL AT THE END OF A DAY IF I WAKE UP LIFT RUN SIRF AND THEN I DO YOU GET THROUGH THE AFTERNOON LIKE AT THE END OF THAT DAY I'M TIRED AND I FEEL TIRED ABUT NORMAL DAY WORKING OUT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER GE DEFINILT GIVES YOU DEFINILI GIVES ME ENERGY I SHOULD SAY CAUSE I GESS I MOT EVERYBODY NOWIT'S I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE LEARNING FROM CIRCADEAN BIOLOGY IN A TIME OF DAY EFFECTS AND SUNLIGHT ALL THAT STUFF THAT WE TUCK BY N OUR PODCAST THAT YOU'VE DONE INTUITIVELY RIGHT THIS WHAL WE HAVE RI RES CANTERAS THE LAST TIME WE HAD A CONVERSATION IS THAT SO MANY THE THINGS THAT SCIENCE IS TELLING US TO DO AN THAT WE EMPHASISE ON THE PODCAST THIS PODCST YOU'VE BEEN DOING ORRE BUILT INTO MILITARY SCHEDULES AND ONE OF THEM AS THIS NOTION OF WAKING UP EARLY AND GETTING PHYSICAL EARLY IN THE DAY AND I SUPOSE IF WE WERE TO JUST THROW ONE BLANKET RULE ON THE TABLE TO ENCOMPASS THE BROADEST NUMBER OF THEMES IT'S THAT ONCE EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE EACH AND ALL GET A BIG INCREASE IN THIS RELEASE OF THE ONE ONE CARTIS ALL WHICHEVERONE SAYS O CARTS ALL IT'S TERRIBLE YOU KNOW IS CAN BURN YOU OUT A DREAN OLL BURN OUT ALL THAT STUFF BUT IT'S A NON NEGOTIABLE PEAK AND YOU WANT IT TO ARRIVE EARLY IN THE DAY AND VIEWING SUNLIGHT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CALFENE AND IN PARTICULAR INTENSE EXERCISE ALL AMPLIFY THAT CORTIS ALL PEAK IN FACT I THINK IT'S THE NUMBERS I'M SEEING IS JUST SUNLIGHT BIEWING GIVES YOU A FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE AN THAT COURSE ALL EXERCISE ON TOP OF THAT ANOTHER FIFTEY TO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE IS TIS HUGE RELEASE IN THIS WORMONE THAT EVERYONE THINKS IT'S TERRIBLE BUT ACTUALLY SETS AS HUGE WAVE IN MOTION FOR THE REST OF THE DAY WHICH GIVES YOU MORE ENERGY HIGER LEVELS OF IMMUNE FUNCTION MORE FOLK ET ET CETERA AND DOES INDEED AS YOU MENTION IN YOUR EXAMPLE OF YOUR DAILY LIFE SETS A TIME OR SO THAT ABOUT FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN HOURS LATER YOU'RE SLEEPY WHICH UST WHAT YOU WANT FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN HOURS LATER UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE RUNNING VAMPIRESHIFTS IN THE MILITARIOR YORON SHIFT WORK BUT MOST PEOPLE AREN'T OF COURSE SO I THINK THE IDEA THAT MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE GIVES US ENERGY I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT IDEA AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WAS FRANKLY I WAS HOPING YOUR ANSWER WOULD BE THAT AS OPPOSED TO THAT YOU KNOW YOU WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND YOU JUST WANTER JUST ATTACK THE WORLD BEC'S YOU HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY GETTING OUT OF BED BECAUSE FRANKLY I NEVER FEELD BUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER AFTER I TRAIN ALWAYS ND OF COURSE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I CRASH IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON IF I TRAIN REALLY REALLY HARD BUT USUALLY THAT'S WHEN I I OVER CALF AND AIT TO AN OUTRAGEOUS DEGREE AND THEN I DON'T NOURISH AFTER WERE I OVER NOURISH SO THIS IS THE OTHER THING THAT EATING THE WHOLE REST IN DIGESTING THE DIGEST WORD IN THERE IS MEANT TO FOR IT'STHERE FOR REASON WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE EAT A REALLY BIG MEAL WE AC SUAL NEAD TO SLOW DOWN SO I HATE TO GET INTO DAILY SCHEDULES AT THE LEVEL NIT PAKING AN NUTRITION IS ABOUT THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC ON THE INNER NECT A BUT D YOU NOURISH AFTER YOU TRAIN AND IF YOU DO DO YOU DO IT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T LIKE LOOK ON MOSTLY FULL OR ON FOR YOU THIN EIT REALLY NOURISH YOURSELF OR YOU FIND THAT EATING SLOWS YOU DOWN I FIND THAT EATING SLOWS ME DOWN AND I WOULD SAY AGAIN THI IT'S WEIRD HOW SOME OF THIS STUFF IS LIKE THE MAME'S I GOT IN THE HABIT OF WAKIN UP EARLY AND WORKING OUT IS CAUS IF YOU DO IT BEFORE ANYONE ELSE IS AWAKE THAN THE CAMP BOTHER YOU WEN YOU CAN GET STUFFED ON RIGHT YOU GO TO SEAL TEAM AND YOU GET THERE BEFORE ANY EELSE IS THERE NO ONE CAN SAY HAY CAN YOU HELP US WITH US HAY NO ONE SENT YOU ANY MEALS YOU GET YOU GET THAT TIME YOU GET IT DONE AND AND AN IT'S YOURS RIGHT I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE ON MY PON CAST AN I DON'T WEAR SOM GLASSES WHEN I RUN IN THE MORNING BECAUSE I SWEAT AND IT FILLS MY SUN GLASSES IT'S NOT BECAUSE I WANT O LET THE YOU VE LIGHT INTO MY EYES THAT'S NOT CORUS ALL E RIGHT NOUT FOR THE CUORTERS ALL I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT'S COOL THAT I KNOW IT NOW BUT I JUST DID IT BECAUSE I DON'T LI HAVE T SWEAT IN MY SOME GLASSES CAN'T SEE SO I JUST RUN WITHOUT AM PUT A HOUT ON UT AS FAR AS EATING I DO'T LIKE TO DO PHYSICALLY ACT IVE THINGS WITH FOOD MY STOMACH THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS YE ME AND SO I DON'T WANT IT AND WHAT REALLY KEEPS THAT IN LINE FROR ME IS I'M DOOING YOU YOT TO AN AFTERNOON AND SO IF I'M EATIN A BIG LUNCH BY THE TIME THE AFTERNOON ROLLS ROUND I'M KIND OF I GOT FOOD IN MY GUD AND I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT FEELING SO NO I DON'T EAT A BIG MEAL UNTIL I'M KIND OF DONE WITH THE PHYSICAL STUFF FOR THE DAY WHICH IS USUALLY AT NIGHT SIX SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHICH I GUESS THERE SOME BAD THINGS ABOUT THAT I EAT TOO ATE WELL THE DATA SAY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE YOW THITS GAT WE CAN GO DOWN AROUT O WHR THIS AND THEN SOMEBONES ON TO PULL UP SOME LITTLE CLINICAL STUDY AND THE ANOTHER ON THE COUNTERS THAT AND I THINK THE DATAS SENTIALLY SAY THAT HAVING A REGULAR MEAL SCHADUEL THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT WHATEVER THAT MEANS FOR YOU AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BE ACTIVE IN FOCAST WHEN YEU NEED TO BE ACTIVE IN FOCUS THAT'S THE IDEAL SCHADU I WHEN I'M WORKING WITH CLIENTS IC AR THE LEADERS OF CONSULT TI COMPANY THAT'S LON'T FROMT WHEN I'M GOING TO WORK WITH A CLIENT I'M NOT EATI ECAUSE BECAUSE THERE CAN BE ASKED ME QUESTIONS WERE TO BE DIVING INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE THEIR BUSINESS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON IT'S A LOT OF COGNITIVE WORK SO I'M NOT EATEN FOR PODCAST I'M NOT ET BEFORE A POTCAST TO PERFORMER O GOING O'POCT GOTSOM NOT EAT CAUSE I DON'T WANTO HAVE A BUNCH OF FOOD O MY STOMACH I WANT O YOU DN'T YOU GET A CERTAIN LEVEL OF MENTAL CLARITY WHEN YOU HAVENT EATEN A BUNCH OF FOOD SO GOONE OUT ON MISSIONS I NEVER WOULD EAT BEFORE I GO O OUT ON A MESSION I WOULD EAT WHEN I COME HOME YOU GET HOME FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THREE O'CLOCK IN TH ORNING FROM DOING OPERATION COOL THAT I'LL EAT CAUSE IN A MENT I'M IN A DOI BE BRIEF FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES CLEAN WEAPONS AND THEN YOU'D A BIG MEAL  GO TO SLEEP COOL YET I DON'T WANT TO HAVE FOOD IN MY STOMACH WHEN I'VE GOT A PERFORM OR EXECUTE ANYTHING SO AGAIN I THINK THAT'S JUST KIND OF A FLUKE THAT I ENDED UP LIVING LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S CINDHOW I LIVE TE FORTUNATE FLUE FOR ALL OF US BECAUSE ABECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU ENBODY AND WHAT YOU DO I THINK CENTERS ROUND THIS IDEA OF DISCIPLINE OF COURSE BUT ALSO ENERGY IT'S IT'S UM IT'S THE INTUITIVE SENSE I GET ABOUT WHY PEOPLE ARE SO DRAWN TO YOUR MESSAGING AND WHAT YOU DO AND HOW YOU DO IT ENERGY WE KNOW OF COURSE IS COLORIC ENERGY I THINK THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE DEFAULT TO THEY GO THAT HOW MANY YOU KNOW CALLORIES ARE ENERGY AND HOW MANY CALORIES IN THAT YOU NEED CALORIES TO FUEL THINGS BUT THE ENERGY THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING I THINK IT'S THE ONE THAT WELL IT REALLY MAPS TO EASTERN TRADITIONS MORE DIRECTLY THOL YENIN YANTHING YENANYEN I WAS GET THAT WRONG SO WHICH IS THE NOTION OF NURL ENERGY AND SO THERE'S A PARTICULAR CLUSTER OF CHEMICALS IN US AS A FANCY NAME CALL THE CATACOLA MEANS BUT THAT'S DOPAMENE A PENAFFERON WHICH IS A DRENTLEMANE AND NOR UP AN EFFORT AND THEN YOU'VE GOT COURTUS ALL AND THOSE FOR HANG OUT TOGETHER AND BASICALLY GIVE US ENOUGH ENERGY TO RUN OUR BRAIN AND BODY FOR FIFTY DAYS FIFTY DAYS SO THE I DEA THA YOU HAVE TO EAT BEFORE YOU TRAIN SURE FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT MIGHT WORK BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT I THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZES THAT ANY TIME WORE OU TAKING IN COLORIC ENERGY IT TAKES NURL ENERGY IN ORDER TO DIGEST THAT AND PUT IT INTO STORAGE AND SO THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE YOUR DAY OF YET I ALSO DON'T EAT BEFORE I TRAIN LIKE A HYDRATE IN CAFANYE I HAVE BEEN DRINKING THESE BEFORE I TRAIN I HAVE TO LIMIT MYSELF TO TUB CORK CAUSE OTHERWISE ARE LIKE LICAN ALREADY QUAKING A LITTLE IT AAM  THE SECOND ONE BUT IAVE A PRETTY HIGH CAFY IN TOLERANCE SO I LIKE TO TRAIN FASTED ALSO AND THEN I FIND IT GIVES ME ENERGY BUT THEN THE MOMENT THAT I EAT A MEAL THAT'S A LITTLE TOO LARGE ALL THE SUDDEN I'M I'M OUT OF ENERGY AND WHAT'S THE DEAL THIS CALORIES OR ENERGY REUSO US TO HAVE ENERGY IN ORDER TO THINK AND MOVE AND I THINK I THINK A LOT OF THE WORLD HAS THIS BACKWARDS AND THIS ISN'T A PUSH FOR INTERMITTAN FASTING OR ANY PARTICULAR STYLE OF EATING REALLY I DON'T CARE OF PEOPLE ARE CARNIVOROVIN DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHATEVER WORKS I HAPPEN TO BE AN OMNIBORE BUT I THINK IT ONCE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THA ENERGY TO DO THINGS IS NURL AND YET OF COURSE IT RELIES ON HAVING GLIKE AGIN AND ALL THE STUFF ROUND BUT NURL ENERGY IS WHAT'S REALLY ABOUT THEN YOUR SCHADUL AND THE WAY YOU FUNCTION AND THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE YOUR SCADL REALLY MAKES A HUN OF SENSE SO YOU DESCRIBED GETTING UP AND LIFTING RUNNING SURFPING ENJUGITU IN THE SAME DAY SO ON A DAY LIKE THAT YOU'RE HYDRATIN CORRECT OH YO NOTLIT IS THAT'S VITAL AND I KNOW IN THE TEAMS IN THE SEAL TEAMS THERE'S A LOT DISCUSSION ABOUT HYDRATION AS IMPORTANTEVEN THOUGH YOU IES I KNOWIS MUST BE ABLE LIKE EAT SAND AND SURVIVE ON SUNLIGHT AND DIRT AND LIKE DRINK YOUR OWN BLODY YOU KNOW IT'S HYDRATIONS COULD TAKE IN SERIOUSLY RIGHT Y ANAN DIFFERENT PEOPLE NEED DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF HYDRATION AND I UNFORSUNURS WONG I ALWAYS NEED TO BRING  WATER WATER IN THE FIELD WHICH SOCKED CAS WATER'S HEAVY AND I HAVE FRIENDS ONE OF MY FRIENDS TONY BE T F TONY YOU GO IN THE FIELD WITH LIKE A CANO COPE AND HAGIN AND COFFEE IN HIS CAN D  GOK LIKE THREE STRAT DAYS ASERTERATE DESERT RAT MAN YOU COU JISSURVIVE AND I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE TO B BRING ITS ON A WATER NIG I SWEAT A TON WHEN I WORK OUT OR WHEN I'M DOING ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES PHYSICAL PHYSICAL OUT PUT I'M GT A I SWEAT ATONE SO I'VE TOR DERN'T DRINK A LOUT OF WATER FOR SURE BUT NOT EVONES THE SAME NOW YE I THINK IF MOST PEOPLE FOCAS MORE ON HYDRATION AND MOVEMENT THEY WOULD FIND THEY HAVE TWO I'M AN A VENTURE GUESS HERES IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC STUDY BUT TO TO FOUR TIMES MORE ENERGY THAN IF THEY FOCUSSED ON COLORIC ENERGY IN WHAT TO EAT YET I THINK THE COOL THING ABOUT THIS YOU'RE USIN THE TERM ENERGY AND WHAT'S COOL ABOUT THIS IS YOU OR I I CREATE ENERGY RIGHT I CREATE ENERGY BY LIKE I SAID BY GOING TO THE BY GOING LIFTING IN THE MORNING BY GOING AND DOING BURP YOU GO TO BERPIES YOU GO TO A HUNDRED PERPES LIKE YOU'RE CREATING ENRGY YOU'RE GOING TO BE TIRED YOU CNO BE SWEADING BUT YOU JUST CREATED ENERGY SO THAT'S STUFF IS ITS TOLLY TRUN GOT THERE'S NEUROW SCIENCE TO BACK IT UP I ACHALYTHING ABOUT DEVOTING SOME OF MY LAP TO THIS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES ANOTHER A FAMILIAR TERRITORY FOR YOU IS COLD WATER YIN NOWADAYS THERE'S A LOT ABOUT ICE BAS AND COLD BATHS AND SHOWERS AND ALL THAT AND IWAYS LIKELY TO SAY IT LISTEN IT'S ALL JUST A RELIABLE SOURCE OF INDUCING A DRENALINE RELEASE AND YOU GET OUT OF A COLD SHOWER YOU HAVE MORE ENERGY AND THAT ENERGY COULDNT HAVE BEEN COLORIC ENERGY IT'S A DRENALINE AND I YOU KNOW AGAIN I'M  IT'S FAIR TO SAY I'M UPSESSED BY THE IDEAS OF IDENTITY WHICH IS LOW BIT HOW WE STARTED OFF AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO IT AND ENERGY I FEEL LIKE IDENTITY AND ENERGY CAN ACCOUNT FOR SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF WHAT IT IS TO YOU KNOW LIVE A GOOD LIFE IF YOU CAN MASTER THOSE BECAUSE THEN IT ALL SEEMS TO FALL INTO BINS IT'S LIKE OF COURSE YOU NEED SLEEP WHY WE'LL TO RESTORE YOUR NEURL ENERGY RIGHT AT SOME POINT YOU JUST FADE OUT OF NARAL ENERGY IF YOU DON'T SLEEP SO SLEEP THEN FALLS INTO A PARTICULAR BIN WITH A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ND THEN EXERCISE BECOMES NOT AWAITS LIKE BURN ENERGY BUT AS YOU SET TO CREATE ENERGY WE AVE SHARE STRYING UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME FOR SECOND ON SOME NAROW SCIENCE I WE DIDN'T TALK BY THIS LAST TIME WE HAVE NARL CRCUITS THAT CONTROLL DELIBERATE ACTION WE HAVE NARL CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL DELIVERATE ACTIONS THAT WE FORGET THAT WE'RE DOING LIKE WALKING AND THEN WE HAVE NARRL CIRCUITS WHICH ARE CALLED CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS AND THESE ARE THE UNERAL CIRCUITS THAT LOVE TO JUST WORK ON THEIR OWN AND IN THE BACKGROUND JUS CUN A HUM IN THE BACKGROUND AND TAKE CARE OF ALL THE STUFF LIKE HEART BEAT BREATHING AND MOVEMENT THAT IS REPETITIVE LIKE IF YOU YOU'RE JUST MARCHING AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO A JUST YOUR CASANS MUCH OR MAE YOUR HIKING EVEN AND STEP IN THIS ROCK THAT ROCK ONCE SO CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS GET GOING IT'S VERY AUTOMATIC AND WE KNOW THAT ONCE SO CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS GET GOING THERE'S THE RELEASE OF THOSE CATACOLA MEANES THOSE THREE OR FOUR MOLECULES THAT THEN FEED ALL THE OTHER NAURAL SYSTEMS THE COLLNREMODULAYERS FOR REASON CAUSE THEY SET THE GAIN HIGHER SEND YOU GO OUT FOR A RUN OR A JOG OR A HIKE OR SOMETHING AND WHERE YOU PEDDLE OR YOU ROW AND THEN YOU'RE WHOLE SYSTEM IS IS AT A HIGHER AR P M SO WHEN YOU SAY CREATE ENERGY NOUR SCIENCES ARE STRYINNERS SHIM WHAT THAT IS REPETITIVE MOVEMENT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FORGET THE MOTOR COMMANDS THAT AE REQUIRED TO GENERATE THAT MOVENT YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT YOUR ROAS STROKE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT THINKING MUCH YOU COME OFF OF THAT AND YOU NOW AR SET AT A HIGHER AR P M TO DO MORE DELIBERATE STUFF AND NONE OF THIS AGAIN INVOLVED LIKE EATING ANOUGH PROBHYDRATES ARE MAKING SURE YOU HA ENOUGH KEYTONES ORE ENOUGH PROTIN LIK ITS LIKE OU GOT PLENTY OF THAT STUFF PROVIDE YOU NOURISH AT SOME POINT EVERY TWENTY FOR HOURS OR SO SO WE WEANT I THINK WE KNOW TE LOBIT ABOUT THE SCIENCE BEHIND JOCKO WILLINKS SCHEDUL NOW UM BUT I WILL ASK THIS ARE THERE CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE LIKE WEIGHT LIFTING VERSES CARDIO THAT YOU FIND GIVE YOU AN ESPECIALLY BIG BOOST IN WHAT WERE CALLING ENERGY AN HERE THIS COULD BE COGNATE OF ENERGY COULD BE PHYSICAL IN TO PUT A A READINESS FOR THE NEXT THING AT FIRST I GOT A BACK YOU UP ON THIS I'T OF BACKING UP YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE SCIENCE SO YOU'VER GIVER ROCK MARCH LIKE PUT ON A HEAVY WEIGHT AND YET OFF YU THEREYOU SORRY INTERRUPT YEA PETEROTEA GOT ME INTO THIS HE GOT INTO DOING A LONG SUNDAY INSTEAD OF A LONG SUNDAY RUN THROWING ON A LIGHT WEIGHT VESS OR A RUCK AND GOING OFF LIKE THREE HOURS AND THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES I FIND IALWAYS WANT TO GO FASTER AND GET IT OVER WITH BUT THEN I'VE LEARNED THAT THE REAL PAIN IN IT SETS IN AROUND AN HOUR AND THEN THE BEAUTY SETS IN AROUND NINETY MINUTES REY LIKE I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY ALL NIGHT AND I NEVER WON TO STOP SEE THAT'S WHEN YOU WERE DESCRIBING HOW THIS CHEMICAL THESE CHEMICALS GET RELEASED AND ONCE YOU'RE IN THAT AUTOMATIC MODE CAUSE IN THE SEAL TEAMS YOU'RE DOING MARITIME OPERATIONS FOR A MONTH AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOME IT KILL HOUSE SHOOTING AND YOU'RE NOT CARING TO MUNCH AWAIGHT AND E YOU GO OUT TO THE DESERT AND NOW YOU'RE PUTIN ON  EIGHTY POUNDS AND YOU'RE GOING ON LIKE DAY ON YOU GET OUT THER'RE GOING EIGHTY POUND ROCK MARCH AND THE FIRST FREEK AND SEVENTEEN MINUTES THE FIRST TWENTY THREE MINUTES JUST SUCK THEY JUST SUCK AND WHAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AS BY THE TIME I WAS YOU KNOW TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD ABOUT OA TIS GING O SOCK FOR SEVENTEEN MINUTES AND MINUTES OR CAN TO BE I'MAN TO BE A ROWE OT AND IT DOESN'T MATTER ANY MONE I CAN JUST KEEP GOING FOR EVER SO ITS AT'S SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHAT I EXPERIENCE MY BASICALLY MY WHOLE DON'T LIFE THERE'S GOIN TO BE A LITTLE BRAKING PERIOD MENTALLY WRWHERE YOU THINK OF THIS TOTALLY SOCKS AND THEN YOU JUST CAN KEEP GOING FOR A REALLY REALLY LONG TIME AND IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL TO YOUR QUESTION OF IS THERE ANY FORM OF EXERCISE THAT GIVES ME THAT ENERGYBOOK I I WOULD HAVE TO SAY LIKE THE THE HIGH INTENSITY SORT OF ANNA ROBIC BLAST YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S ON THE BIKER ON THE ROW OR OR YOUR SWIING TO CATTLE BELL HARD SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT LAST TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY TO YOUD' PEIK MY MENTALITY FOR THE DAY DO YOU DO THE COLD WATER THING IMAND YOU DISCERNLY TOA LOT OF IN BUDS AMID YOU YOU FORCE YOURSELF INTO COLD WATER IVING MYVEI'VE A COLD BATH ON MY HOUSE AND I GET IN EVERYDAY  HALLONG YO SPENDING IN THER USUALLY AROUND FIVE MINUTES FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOU TRAIN WE'RE AFTER NOIN AFTER SO THES SOME I HAVEN'T PLAYED WITH YET AND YOR ME I'M LIKE I'M LIKE SUCH A I I DON'T LIKE TO MAKE A BUNCH OF EFFORT FOR SOMETHING SO FOR ME GOING DOWNSTAIRS GETT INTO ICE TUB AND I GUESS YOU ONLY NEED TO DO IT BEFORE YOU WORK OUT Y ONLY GO MINUTE RIGHT DO MINUTES A THREE JOE AND I'VE BEEN TEXING BACK I' FORTH ABOU THIS THERE'S A LAB AT STAMFORD CRAG HELLER'S LAB THAT WORKS ON COLD IN PERFORMANCE AND THE ATHLETES THAT STAMFORD MAINLY THE THE CROSS COUNTRY TEAM IN THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS ARE DOING COLD BEFORE THEI'R TRAINING BECAUSE OF THE HUGE INCREASE HUGE LONG LASTING INCREASE IN DOPAMEN AND A DRENALIN THAT 'CAUSED BY THAT THEY'RE FINDING IT INCREASES PERFORMANCE MAINLY BY WAKING PEOPLE UP AGAIN THE FO IT CREATES ENERGY IS AND STUDENTS YOU NEVER ON THINGS SO LIKE O ATHLETES ARE ALL SUPERMOTIV ATED THIS IS NO PICK AGAIN STAMFORD ATHLETES IN PARTICULAR A LOT OF ATHLETES ARE EXCELLENT TO WHAT THEY DO BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY LAZY WHEN THEY'RE NOT TRAINING THIS IS TRUE NOT ALL ATHLETES BUT A LOT OF ATHLETES AR AND SO THE REALLY GOOD AT RESTING AND RECOVERING SO THEY CAN TRAIN MORE BUT A LOT OF ATHLETES HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING IN TO INTO GEAR TO TO TRAIN EVERY DAY AND THE COLD IS A GREAT STIMULUS RIGHT IT'S A FORCE IT'S LIKE A FORESHOT OF THE SPRESSO CONSTIMULUS WITHOUT ALL THE JITTERS I THINK MAYBE GOING THERE FOR A MINUTE WOULD BE COOL BEFORE WORK OUT I WE'LL SAY THIS SO I HAD I HAD LIKE A LONG WORK OUT AND IT WAS A SATURDAY WHICH MEANS ON SATURDAY I DO TO JIS THROUGH KIND OF IN THE MORNING ROUND TEN O'CLOCK AND I HAVE LIKE A LONG WORK OUT WENT FOR A LONG RUN IT WAS HOT AND I JUST GOT IN THE ICE BATH AND A SATN THERE FOR LIKE SEVEN MINUTES LIKE THE DEEP CHILL I GOT OUT THEN I WENT RIGHT TO DEDUCE TO MY FELT AWFUL I FELT ABSOLUTE AWFUL LIKE I COLD AND IT TO ME N EXTR THREE ROUNDS TO GET WARMED UP AGAIN SO THAT KINDRY LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH FOR TREE WORK ICING BUT I WAN T TRY THAT SHORT O'LL TALK IN ANOTHER FRONT OF MY  LIKE O NO ONLY GO A MINUTE BEFORE MY OT OF THAT A TRO IF IT'S REALLY COLD A THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTEIS GING TO GET YOU THE THIS BIG RELEASE IN A DRENNAL IND AND AND DOPAMEN ACTUALLY ONE TIME I DID TRY TO KNOW THE YUM THE THE CHAMBER THAT BLAST COLD ARON YOU THE CRIO THE OTHER CRY WHEN I DID THAT FOR FOR LIKE A MINUTE OR WHENEVER AND THAT DID MAKE ME FEEL THREE WORK OUT PRETTY GOOD YET I THINK THAT THE THE WHOLE NOTION OF COLD FOR MATABLISM MEANO PEOPLE SAY WELL IT'S NOT THAT THEY GIV AN INCREASIN METABILIS   AS FAR AS I'M CONCERND THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE COLD FOR MOST PEOPLE IS GOING TO BE THE DISCIPLINE OF DOING IT THE SENSE OF RESILIENCE THAT YOU CAN BUILD UP OVER TIME JUST BEING FAMILIAR WITH HAVING IN THE DRENDLIN IN YOUR SYSTEM AND THEN THE FACT THAT THE DOBAMING INCREASES ARE HUGE AND LONG LASTING AN THEY LIKE TWO POINT FIVE ACS INCREASES AT THERE'S A COLLIGA IND AT STAMFORD ON OLEMPCY RUNS OUR DUAL DIGNOSIS A DICTION CLINETT SHOEULD A PATIENT GETTING OFF COCAN EDICTION WHO DESIDE TO USE COLD ICE BATHS AS A WAY TO ACCONT OF ASSIST HIMSELF ALONG THE WAY YOU KNOW IT WASN'T GET DOPAMEN FROM COQANING MORE SO YOU'DSIDE TO GET IT FROM THE ICE BATH THE DIFFERENCE IS IS COQANG AS YOU THE SHARP E INCREASES AND THE DECREASES THE DROP YOU WAY BELOW BASE LINE SO WHAT IF PEOPLE DO THEY GO SEEK MORE CROCANE IT'S REALLY PERNICIOUS THAT WAY WHEREAS THE ICE BATH AND AND COL CHOWERS WILL GIVE THIS LONG AR CLASTING TWO TO THREE HOURS OR MORE AND THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING TO TREASURE YOU KNOW THE IDEA THT YOU CAN BASILY SAVE ON YOUR HEATING BILL YOU KNOW GIVE YOURSELF THIS HUGE DOPO MEAN INCREASE AND I THINK EVERYTHING POINTS THE FACT THAT IT'S HEALTHY AND GOOD BUT I MEAN OBVIOUSY IT'S WORKING FOR YOU TO DO AFTER YOUR TRAINING I THINK ALL THE THE GIMERATS WHO WANT MORE HYPERTROPHY YOURE TRYIN TO GET AN EXTRAYOU KNOW EIGHTH OF AN INCH ON THEIR TRYSEPER WHATEVER THEY FREAK OUT CAUSE THEY HEAR THAT IT CAN INHIBIT HYPERTROPHY UM AND THEN FOR WHATEVER REASON TERE IS THIS AT SORM I DOING IT WRONG WELL I MEAN GET CLEARLY YOUR YOU'RE DOING NO YOU'RE NOT I YOUR I DON'T THING YOUR HYPERTROPHY IS SUFFERING I ACTUALLY AM OF THE MIND THAT IF YOU'R TRAINING REALLY HARD SURE GETTING IN THE COLD AFTERWARDS MIGHT BLUNT SOME HYPERTROPHY THAT IS WHAT THE DATA TELL US ANY GALLOPINS KIND THE EXPERTE ON THAT LITERATURE BUT FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW ANY ONE THAT TRAINS REALLY HARD WITH THE WEIGHTS AND THEY GETS INTO THE COLD THAT LOOKS LIKE THEIR SUFFERING FROM HYPERTROPHY I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HOWEVER WHO LOVE TO POINT FINGERS AT AND POKET COLD EXPOSURE THISE SEEMS TO BE A BIG THING ON SOCIAR M E OF PEOPLO DON'T LIKE THE COLD LOVE TO POINT OUT THE STUDIES SHOWING THAT THE COLD SCREWS UP EVERYTHING UM AND MOST OF THEM LOOK LIKE THEY NEED A FEW SETS IN THE GIM A TO ME AND  YOU KNOW O FEEL COHA POKAT THEM CAUSE I FEELIKE ALL OF THESE ARE JUST TOOLS RIGHT AND IM IN ANY CASE I I'M A BIG FAN OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE MOSTLY FOR THE NUURAL EFFACTS AGAIN I'M OBSESSING OVER THIS CONCEPT OF ENERGY AND IT' SOMETHING THAT I I CAN'T HELP BUT ASK IS THAT IT IS THE COGNATIVE SIDE OF THIS IN THE KIND OF THE THE EFFECTS OF WINNING AND LOSAND SO YOU OBVOUSLY HAVE A LOT OF DEPLOYMENTS U AND A LOT OF WINS WHATEVER IN THE CONTECTS THAT MEN IT KILL THE TARGET CAPTURE THE CAPTURE THE HOSTAGE CETERA AND THEN UM AS IS THE CASE WITH WAR UM THEREE BEEN SOME CASES OF LOSSES RIGHT YOU'VE LOST PEOPLE UM MAYBE THERE WERE TARGETS THAT WEREN'T ACCOMPLISHED RIGHT THIS KIND OF THING YOU'VE POSTED ABOUT THESE AND TESE ARE ALWAYS UM  YOU KNOW THINGS THAT ARE HARD TO SEE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU POST ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE LOST RIGHT BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THESE PEOPLE SERVE BUT SECOND OF ALL THAT THINGS DON'T ALWAYS WORK OUT THE WAY THAT WEWE WANT ED SOMETIMES TO REALLY CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES THERE'S A THEORY AND BIOLOGY THAT WHEN WE WIN WE SOMEHOW GET MORE ENERGY TO WIN MORE THROUGH THE RELEASE OF NO SURPRISE DOPAMEN AND SOME RELATED MOLECULES IN IN FACT TESTOSTERONE IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IS ANOTHER CLOSE COUSIN OF THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM AFSHU RELEASED FROM THE SAME GENERAL OR THE THE PATTERNS OF RELEASE ARE FROM THE SAME GENERAL AREAS IN THE BRAIN BELIEVE IT ARE NOT AND BODY BUT WHEN WE WIN WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN KEEP GOING IREYOU LOOK AT THE TEAM THAT WINS IN'TS LIKE THEY'LL PLAY ANOTHER GAME THE SUPERABLE WINNERS ARE YOU MAGINE THEIRE JUMPIN UP AND DOWN AND THEY COULD PROD PLAY ANOTHER SUPERBOLE LOSING WE KNOW CAN SURE CAN DROP THINGS LIKE TESTOSTERONE AND DOPA MEAN FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME BUT WHEN YOU WERE IN THE TEAMS WHAT WAS YOUR OBSERVATION ABOUT HOW WINNING AND LOSING WOULD IMPACK PEOPLE IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM IN OTHER WORDS WOULD YOU OBSERVE PEOPLE THAT HAD A QUICK RESET BUTTON AND COULD YOU SAY THAT WAS TERRIBLE AND THEN TRANSMUTE I GUESS I'M GETTING INTOTO THE AT THE THE EASTERN LANGUAGE NOUT CONVERT THAT INTO ENERGY TO GO DO BETTER THE NEXT TIME RES WE ALSO SEE PEOPLE MILITARY AND IN THE CIVILIAN WORLD THAT A LOSS IN PARTICULAR SEVERE LOSSES THASELY SET THEM DOWN THE PATH OF LIKE LESS ENERGY CERTAINLY IS IN LESS CALLORIES IN THAT MOST OF TIME IS THE OTHER WAY THEY START CONSUMING MORE CALLORIESAN THAT DOESN'T GET THEM GOING SO AGAIN THIS NOTION OF ENERGY AND OM ASKING WINDSVERSES LOSSES WHAT DID YOU OBSERVE AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LEADERSHIP AND MAY BE MORE IMPORTANTLY FROM THE PROSPECTIVE YOURSELF HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THAT HOW DO YOU CALIBRATE WINDS AND LOSSES HOW DO YOU TRANSMUT LOSSES INTO ENERGY THESE WINDS WE KNOW CONVERT TO ENERGY BUT LOSSES OFTENTIMES CAN SAP OUR ENERGY WAY WAY DOWN I THINK TO START WITH I THINK THAT THE SELECTION PROCESS TO GET INTO THE SEAL TEAMS IS GOING TO WEED OUT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT CAN'T RECOVER VERY QUICKLY FROM SOMETHING BAT SO YOU PROBABLY HEARD THESE TYPE OF STORIES BEFORE THE KID THAT WAS THE STAR OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM THE STAR OF THE BASKETBALL TEAM THE CAPTAIN OF THIS THE CAPTAIN OF THAT HE'S BEEN WINNING HIS WHOLE LIFE HE GOES TO BUDS AND HE QUITS BECAUSE IN BUDS YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOKINGTO WIN EVERYTHING THEY'RE GING TO FIND WHAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT AND THEY'RE GOING TO EXPLOIT THAT AND YOU'RE GING TO LOSE THIS WHAT HAPPENS SO A LOT OF GUYES THAT MAY LOSE AND IT DISRUPS THEY'RE THEY'RE MOTE OV ATION THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST GOING TO QUIT AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU GET THIS MASSIVE ATRICION RAY WITH GUYES THAT ARE STUDS I MEAN WERE TALKING A DIVISION ONE ATHLETES DIVISION ONE AFWIC DIVISION ONE RESTLERS DIVISION ONE FOOTBALLPLAYERS DIVISION ONE RUNNERS AND SWIMMERS THEY ALL COME TO BUDS THEY ALL QUIT NOT ALL FO QUIT BUT THEY'RE'S PLENTY OF EXAMPLES OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF COLLEGIAN AFH WE IN SPORTS THAT TRANSLATE VERY WELL TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN IN BASIC SEAL TRAINING AND THEY QUIT AND SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOSE THY DON'T N HOW TO RECOVER FROM A LOSS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST SO SO I THINK ALREADY AND ONCE YOU GET TO A SEAL TEAM YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE GENERALLY SPEAKING GOIN TO BE PRETTY RESILIAN WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH A LOSS NOW O THAT I 'M USE GET USE YOU TALK ABOUT LOSING PEOPLE YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH THIS GU YOU MEET THIS GUY AND SEAL TRAINING HAY THE SGUY SEEMS LIKE A STUD O HE JUST GOIN TO QUIT AND AND YOU'RE GONG TO LOSE FIVE SIX SEVEN PEOPLE EIGHT PEOPLE PEOPLE QUIT SO FASHIONN KEEP TRACK OF EM SO YEARS GAN A LOSE YOURE'S GOING TO GET USED TO IT SO THERE'S THAT NOW ONCE YOU'RE IN THE TEAMS AND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT US NOW YOU START TAKING MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT LOSTAN I LHOSE NARRATIOU LOSE OF WONE YOUR FRIENDS AND THERE'S WHAT FROM A LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVE YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO SO WHEN YOU'RE IT A LEADER IN ANY ORGANIZATION YOU'RE BASICALY IN CHARGE OF THE MOB WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THEIR MORAL IS THEY'RE THEY'RE A MOB AND THEY FEED OFF WEACH OTHER JUST LIKE A MOB RITING IN THE STREETS CAN ALL WE CAN BREAK THIS WHENDLLIS BREAK ALL THE WINDOWS AND THNTHEY MOVE THIS MOB MENTALITY AND THAT HAPPENS WITH MORAL INSIDE OF A TEAM AND YOU AS A LEADER CAN'T GET CAUGHT UP WITH THE MOB YOU CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN YOU HAVE TO DETACH YOURSELF FROM THE MOB MENTALLY SO THAT YOU DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THEYIR EMOTIONS AND THEYR MORAL BECAUSE IF YOU GET CAUGHT UP IN THEIR EMOTIONS AN YOU G CAUGHT UP IN MIRAT THEIR MORAL YOU CAN'T CORRECT IT SO WE GO OUT ON A MISSION THE MISSION GOES GREAT WE GET DO A GUN FLIGHT KILL A COUP OF BAD GUIVES EVERY ONE'S O KAY HIVE FIVES EVERY ONE'S FEELING GREAT YOU COME BACK TO BASE HEY WE DON'T NEED O DEE BRIEF THAT WAS PERFECT HEY WE DON'T NEED TO GETER GEAR YOU KNOW A MAINTAIN WE CAN JUST GO TO BED WEAT WE'RE ALSOM THAT'S WHEN THE LEADER HAS TO SAY OH WE'VE GOT THE MOB AND THE MOB IS BECOMING SLIGHTLY ARROGANT HEGES RE'LL QUICK THAT WAS A GOOD OB BUT THERE' SOME THINGS WE COULDN'T PROVE BUT YOU GOT A BRAING THAT MOB BACK AND BRING THEM BACK TO CENTERLINE SAME THING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION YOU GOT OR N OPERATION IT DOESN'T GO WELE YOU GOT AN OPERATION YOU TAKE CASUALTIES NOW YOU COME BACK TO BASE YOU SEE GUYS MOPING AROUND YOU SEE THAT THE SPIRIT STARTIN TO BREAK AND SAME THING IF YOU IF YOU'RE PART OF THAT MOB YOU'LL BE YOU'LL BE WITH THEM YOUR MIRAL WILL BE BREAKING YOUR SPIRIT WE BREAKING YOU EVER LOOK N  OH I SEE WHAT'S HAPENING HEGES LISTEN UP THAT WAS TOUGH DIDN'T GO THE WAY WE WANTED IT TO GO WE NEED TO LEARN SOME LESSONS HE'RE SOME THINGS I CAN DO BETTER WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNE TO GO OUT AND AVENGE OUR BROTHER ON THE BATTLEFIELD WHAT CAN WE DO TO MOVE THIS THING FOR IT SO AS A LEADER WENT COMES TO WINNING AND LOSING YOU'RE GENERALLY GOING TO BE THE PERSON COUNTERING WHAT THE MOB MENTALITY IS CAUSE WHEN TE MOB STARTS WINNING THEY WANT TO KEEP WINNING AND THEY MIGHT GET ARROGANT WHEN THE MOB IS LOSING THEY MIGHT START TO LOSE MORE BECAUSE THE'RE ATTITUDE GOES DOWN THE DRAIN SO THAT'S WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO FROM A LEADERSHIP RESPECTIVE FOR FOR ME PERSONALLY I THINK I KNOW WHAT I DID WHEN WHEN I LOST GUYSES WAS FOCUS ON ARE I WE NEED WE NEED TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE WE NEEDNT'T MOVE THE MORN VUL LOSS AND THEN WE NEED TO GO TO WORK WE NEED TO GET ER GEAR BACK ON WED TO LOCK AN THOTOR WEAPONS WE NEED TO GET BACK OUT THERE I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED DO YOUNO SO OFTEN THE BEST WAY TO CONTEND WITH WITH PROBLEMS WITH ISSUES WITH ADVERSITY IS ACTION I'S BY TAKING ACTION THE MORE YOU SIT AND THE MORE YOU WAIT AND THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND WITH THAT ADVERSITY WITH THE UPPER HAND INSIDE YOUR HEAD THET THE WORSE IT'S GOING TO GET SO FOR ME ALWAYS TAKING ACTION MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HUGE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOME MAMMITH YOU KNOW OF TRIUMPH THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO AND GO IN PURSUE BUT IF YOU SAY HEYLISS'N THIS WHAT HAPPEN DIDN'T GO THE WAY YO WANTED IT TOO WERE'T GET ER GER BACK ON WERE TO GO BACK OUT WE'RE TO WERE TO WOING TO DO THIS OTHER MISSION AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I THINK I THINK TAKING ACTION AND IT'S IN IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE TOO YOU KNOW SOMETHING DOESN'T GO THE WAY YOU WANTED IT TO GO YOU DIDN'T GET THO JOB YOU WANTED YOU 'T GET THE HIGHER YOU N GET THE PROMOTION YOU CAN GO HOME AND SIT THERE IN AND AND DWELL ON IT THAT'S NOT GET YOU INY PROGRESS OR YOU SAY OK GAT YOU KNOW WHAT ME DO QUICK ANALISIS WHY DIDN'T GET THAT PROMOTION OH IT'S CAUSE I DIDN'T GET THIS QUALIFICATION OR I HEADN'T JUMP THROUGH THIS GAIT OOK EC WHAT DON'TYOU LETT LEMMIT LEM ME LOOK IN T HOW TO HOW O I GET TO JUMPTHROUGH THAT GATE SO NEXT TIME I WOLL GET TO PROMOTION YOUSTARE TAKING ACTION SO ACTION FOR ME IS A CURE FOR A LOT OF PROMS THAT WE HAVEIN LIFE LOVE THIS BECAUSE THE IMAGE THAT'S SURISING MY MIND I'M I'LL SHARE IT WITH YOU AND TELL ME WHERE IT AGREES WITH IN MAY BE VIOLET'S WHAT YOU'R WHEN YOU TELL ME BUT WHAT I WET'S IMAGINING IN WHEN YOUR TIME AT LEADERSHIP IN THE MOB IS YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF CANDLES BUT NOT WAX CANDLES THESE ARE OIL CANDLES YOU HING ABOUT A WINDS HE YOU I COUN BE AN OP GO OUT IN WEN IT COUN BE A TEAM IT CON BE AN INDIVIDUAL TAKING IN EXAMINE THE GET IN A PLAS SO IT IT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THERE THE RIDING HIVE IN THOSE WINDS WE KNOW CRANK UP THOSE CATACOLAMENS AND IT'S AS IF THE INTENSITY THAT FLAME STARTS GOING UP AS A CONSEQUENCE THAT'S NATURAL BUT THE OIL IN THE CANDLE IS CONTINUING TO BURN DOWN LIKE YOU NEED TO CELEBRATE WINDS BUT YOU'RE BURNING THAT OIL AND SO WE'R REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS HOW TO MODERATE AND THEN WECLAIM ENERGY AND I WAS IMAGINEIG YOU IS THE LEADER WHO'S LIKE A CAGEES GREAT BUT LISTEN YOU'RE BURNING THAT OIL RIGHT THAT OIL IS WHAT YOU GOT YOU THE WIN LET'S NOT JUST CLAMP IT LIKE WE CAN UNO DO IF YO IF YOU THIS BOMBSIN YOU KNOW MAY BE CELEBRATE IN SOME OTHER WAYS BUT THEN LET'S REAT LET'S TAKE THE ENERGY WE GOT AND PUT IT TO THE NEXT THING RATHER THAN JUST GO CRAZY DRUG'S OF ABUSE IN PARTICULAR DRUGS THAT TAPPING THE DOPENING SYSTEM NAMELY COCANIN AND FEDAMINE AND JUST CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO AVOID THIS IT WE'RE BEING TRUE TO THE BIOLOGY THE THE ENERGY THE DOPAMEN SYSTEM WAS DESIGN FOR FORAGING FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS FOOD SO PEOPLE THAT OVERINDULGE FOOD OR SEEK OUT FOOD SAXS PEOPLE THAT OVERINDULGE IN THESE THINGS THEY Y THOSE THINGS AND AGAIN THIS SORT  LEANS TO EASTERN PHILOSOPHY A BIT BUT THERE'S WESTERN OR ASCIENCE OR NORSCIENCE WICH OU TO SAY TO SUPPORT IT YOU START TO DEPLETE THESE DOPEMING SYSTEMS THE BASE LINE STARTS TO DROP AND SO 'M IMAGINING THAT THE LEADER YOU IN THIS CASE IS SAYING LIKE LISTEN LET'S TON IT DOWN USE THE ENERGY THAT WE'VE GAINED AND PUT IT TO GOOD USE RATHER THAN JUST BURN IT UP AN JOYING IT AND THEN OF COURSE WENT AFTER A LOSS WHEN THE'SE I SORT THINK OF THE CANDLES GOING DIMMER AND THE BUT THE OIL RESERVE IS STILL THERE AN I'SAK HOW DO YOU START TO TAP BACK INTO THE OIL RESERVE WELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE SHY RAMP THE CANDLE UP AGAIN YOU CAN'T JUST SIT THERE WAITING FOR THE YOU KNOW THE A THE INTENSITY THE FLAME TO COME BACK YOUES SHOEU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN SO MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE BEST ANALGY CAUSE IT LACKD SORT OF LIKE THE EXACTLY WHAT IS THAT THE PERSON TURNING THE INTENSITY UP AND DOWN ON THESE CANDLES BUT THAT'S WHAT COMES TO MINE AND IN EASTERN TRADITIONS THERE'S THIS IDE A CHEE OF ENERGY ENERGY TO FIGHT ENERGY TO SEEK MATES ENERGY TO SEEK FOOD ENERGY FOR SACS ENERGY TO FOR ALL OF IT IS THE SAME ENERGY AND I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE ENERGY THAT THEYRE REFERRING TO ARE THESE CATACOLOMENS I REALLY DO NOW THERE'RE OTHER ENERGY SYSTEMS TOO RELATING TO CHILD RWEARING PERABOND ING OXY TOSE AND ALL THE KIND OF LIKE FUZZY WARM STFF THAT'S SUPERIMPORTANT AND WHEN WE WOULDN'TEXIST AS A SPECIES THE WAY WE DO IF IF WE DIDN'T HONOR THAT ENERGY SYSTEM ALSO AND THAT ENERGY SYSTEM THAT WE NORMALLY THINK OF AS LOVE AS UPPOSED TO FORWARD CENTER OF MASS SENERGIZES WITH THIS SYSTEM NIGHTLY WHEN YOU'RE R WORKING WITH IN TRAINING WITH AND A PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE THIS COULD BE YOUR YOUR BROTHERS YOUR SYSTERS WHATEVER YOUR FAMILY THERE IS I THINK THERE'S AN AMPLIFYING EFFECT ON THIS WHOLE THING RIGHT IF IS JUST FOR MORE DOPA MEN JUST FOR MORE MONEY JUST FOR MORE WINDS JUST FOR MORE TROPHI'S I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS IS INSIDE WHEN I WAS A KID I HAD THIS WEIRD EXPERIENCE WHERE TONY HAWKED DAD RESCUED ME FROM A SCAPEWARD CONTEST IN WIND OF VISTA THE LINVIS TO BOYS UP EVERYONE ELSE LEFT I WAS LEFT THERE ALONE I WAS FOURTEEN CAUSE MY HOME LIFE OT THAT TIME ET CETERA AND HE WAS LIKE WHERE YOU AN O LAMAN TAKE THE BUST O LANCASTER I KNOW THIS GUYNINAS LIKE NON O YOU'RE COME INTO OUR HOUSE ZERGASE WE TOOK ME A TONY'S HOUSE AND I WENT INTO TONY'S ROOM THAT HE'D GROWN UP IN TONY LIVED IN FALVRIC AT THAT TIME AND THE ROOM WASN'T FILLED WITH TROPHYES THE ROOM WAS TROPHIES AND I REMEMBER JUST THINKING LIKE WHOLLY CANLIKE AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT A HEALTHY PERSON TONY TURNED OUT TO BE TO HAPPENED THE BLESS TO KNOWIMA LIL BIT IT'S AMAZING CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAD THOSE TROPHIES WHATEVER DOMAIN OF LIFE THEY CONVERTED ALL THAT INTO WASOD JUST BURN THE OIL DOWN IN THEIR CANDLE HE'S A GUY WHO'S STILL GOING IN HIS FIFTIES RIGHT SO AMMIT THAT'S A LITTLE SIDE STORY BUT I THINK THIS NOTION OF ENERGY TO ME IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS YOU SAID WHEN WE MOVE TOWARD ACTION AND WE COMPLETE SOMETHING THE OILIN THAT CANDLE STARTS TO GET REPLENISHED AND THE FLAME BURNS HOTTER WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I'M VERY INTERESTED A THIS NOW AND I DN'T NOW IF THERE'S THERE'S ALREADY BEEN MEASURED OR NOT BUT WHAT ESSENTIALY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT IS A CONFIDENCE LOVEL RIGHT SO IF I GO OUT AND WIN I FEEL GOOD ABOUT AND IT ET LET'S AM DONA JUGISYTURNIMENT AND THE FIRST MATCH I WAT THEN I  SUBMIT THE GUYAND THIRTY'S TAKEN DOWN SEMIT HIM EN THERTY SECONDS I'M FEELING GOOD I'M FEELING LIKE CONFIDENT RIGHT SO WHAT IS THAT MEAN MY DOPAMEAN IS UP CAUSE I GOT THAT VICTIM MY TASTOSTEROMS UP CAUSE I GOT THAT VICTORY MY CONFIDENCE IS UP CAUSE I GOT THAT VICTORY SAME THING OTHER DIRECTION IF I GO OUT FIRST MATCH AND I LOSE TO SOMEBODY MI DOPAMEN GOES DOWN THAT CHEMICAL THING GOES DOWN MY CONFIDENCE GOES DOWN AND WHAT WHAT I HAVE TO DO AS I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE BECAUSE IF I GET OVERIF I WIN THAT FIRST MATCH WIN THE SECOND I SOME ONE ON TO KILL THIS NEX SKY AND I GO OUT ON SLOPPY AND I DON'T CARE THAT'S WHEN I GET CAUGHT IF I GET TOLD IF I LACK CONFIDENCE I GO UP THIN THERE'S NOTHING EY'LL DO TO BEAT THIS GOD IS GING O BE HORRIBLE OF COURSE I'M GING TO GET SMASHED SO IT'S IT'S A SIMILAR THING THAT WERE' TALKING HAT I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH IF YOU START MEASURING CAUSE IF THEY SAY HAY IF YOU WIN YOUR TASTOSTRAM GOES UPRIGHT AND THEN IF YOU WIN MORE YOUR TESTAOSTROM GOES UP ON YOUR DOPE ME GOES UPHI YOUR CONFIDENCE IS GOING UP BUT YOU CAN GET TO A POINT WHERE YOUR CONFIDENCE IS TOO HIGH AND NOW YOU'RE GETTING SLOPPY AND I Y DON'T CARE AND IT YOURE YOU MENTION COKANE YOU YOU SEE LIKE VIDIOS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ALL COKED UP AND T I CAN JUST THEY THEY THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING ALL PULLIVER CONFIDENT RIGHT THEY'RE OVER THEY THINK THEY CAN KICK YOUR ASCAL I THAT THAT'S LIKE TOO MUCH DOPA MEN TOO MUCH E GO TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE THE OTHER SIDE F THE SPECTRUM IS SOME ONE THAT'S ON SOME KIND OF DOWNER DRUG AND THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN DO ANYTHING THEY'RE LATHARGIC THEIR CONFIDENCE IS LOW AND THEY'RE JUST DEPRESSED SO THERE'S AN INTERESTING TYIN BETWEEN DOPA MEN E GO CONFIDENCE AND PROBABLY TASTOSTERON THAT YOU GET FROM WINNING AND FROM LOSING AND ONCE AGAIN AS A LEADER FROM A LEADERSHIP PRESPECTIVE YOU CAN'T GET WRAPPED UP IN THAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T GET WRAPPED UP IN THAT YOU HAVE TO DETACH FROM T YOU HAVE TO BEAL TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND THEN IF YOU'RE GOOD EVEN AS A COMPETITOR YOU'LL SAY OH HAVE THAT LAST MATCH WAS EASY BUT I NEED TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT MATCH I CAN'T BRING OVER CONFIDENCE LOOK I DONT WANT A LACK TO CONFIDENCE IT'S A BALANCE RIGHT IT'S THAT IT'S THAT FLAME ON THE OIL BURNING LAMP THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THAT STEADY FLAME YOU DON'T WANT TOO MUCH GOING TO BURN OUT CONTROL YOU DN'T WANT TOO LITTLE THE FLAMAL GO OUT YET REALLIERE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS NOTION THAT THE SOME THESE OLDER HUNGARIAN PSYCHOLOGISTS HAD WHICH THE NOTHO OF GENERATORS VIRSES PROJECTORS AND THEIR IDEA AS THAT PEOPLE SO DIVIDE INTO THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN THE WORLD NEEDS BOTH IT'S NOT A THAT ONE IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER BUT THE WORLD ABSOLUTELY NEEDS BOTH AND THERE IS IS IDEA NOW THEYSE ON SOME NARROW SCIENCE AND SOME OTHER SYCHOLOGY THAT I'VE BEEN LATHING IN TO WHICH IS THAT GENERATORS KNOW HOW TO TAPPEN TO THIS SYSTEM AND THEY LOVE THIS SYSTEM I THINK THAT'S YOUR STORY ABOUT BEING TAKEN A SHOP FOR PANCE THAND IT TURNS OUT TO BE A TRIP TO SHOP FOR IT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES FOR YOU RIGHT A REALLY TELLING EXPERIENCE I HAVING IT HAVING AN ACTION EFFECT ON THE WORLD AND SOMETHING COMETHING BACK TO YOU THAT STILL SITS WITH YOU INSIDE IN FACT THERE'S A DON'T A MEAN CIRCUIT THEY ARE STILL RELATED TO THIS YOU KNOW YOUNG WOMEN OR THEN YOUNG WOMAN AT THAT TIME SOME PEOPLE ARE GENERATORS AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE MORE TUNE TO THIS DOPAMEAN SYSTEM AND SO AS WERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I'M GUESSING THAT ABOUT THE ESTIMATE IS THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING YET I GET IT MORE WORKOUTSIS GINGTO GIVME MORE ENERGY I NEED TO DO MORE OF THAT I NEED TO WHEN I'M BACK ON MY HEELS I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE THINGS I CAN COMPLETE ET CETERA AND THEN THE OTHER FORTY FIVE PER CENT OR SO THIRTY FIVE PER CENT MIGHT BE SAYING HOW REALLY GET IT NOW THE IDEAS THAT THE PROJECTORS CAN TAPPEN TO TE SAME CIRCUITS EVERYONE HAS THESE CATECOLAMEAN CIRCUITS DOPAMING ET CETERA BUT THAT THEY TEND TO BE MORE OF OBSERVERS IN THE WORLD AND THEY LIKE BEING PARTNERED WITHIN SIMBIOTIC WITH THESE PEOPLE NOW THIS STARTS TO TAKE ON KIND OF LIKE STERA TYPICAL MASCULINE FEMININE THINGS BUT THIS EXISTS ON BOTH SIDES IT REALLY DOES THERE MIGHT BE SOME BIASES RIGHT BY BIOLOGICAL SECTS THERE MAY NOT BE RIGHT WE COULD ARGUE THAT IT'S POBY AN ARGUMENT HEY'LL GET US INTO MORE TROUBLE THAN TO ANSWERS IT DOESN'TREALLY MATTER THE POINT IS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO BE IN THE COMPANY OF PEOPLE WINNING BECAUSE THEY FEEL GOOD TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE WINNING THEY LIKE TO BE A SUPPORT STAFF THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD OTHER PEOPLE WOULD RATHER STICK HOT FORKS IN THEIR EYES THEN NOT BE THE PERSON ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVITY MAY'M NOT EVERY ACTIVITY BUT THE ACTIVITY SO WHICH TIME IT H GENERATORS IN THE PROJECTORS I THINK THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF MODERATING THESE SYSTEMS IT'S SO KEY I MEAN IT'S KEY TO HAVE A LONG ARCH IN A CAREER PATH MILITARY SCIENCE OR OTHERWISE I THINK IT'S KEY AN EVERY DOMAIN OF LIFE AND I THINK FOR ME ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED BOTH THE HARDWAY AND I'VE ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE POSIVE EXPERIENCE OF I THINK IN RELATIONSHIPS THAS CON BE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT ALSO FRIENDSHIPS AND IN FAMILY THE'RE BECAUSE THERE ARE GENERATORS AND PROJECTORS ALMOST ALWAYS IN THOSE KIND OF SIMBIOTIC RELATION CUT A YOW ROMANTIC COUPLE OR A FAMILY THAT YOU KNOW SOME KIDS ARE MORE GENERATOR SOME OR MORE PROJECTORS JUST BY BY SOMETHING WHO KNOWS MAYBEIT'S HARD WIRED MAY BE NOT AS THE LEADER OF YOUR FAMILY I'MEN ASS ONE OF THE TWO LEADERS BUT AS A LEADER IN YOUR FAMILY IN I CAN MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS HERE AS THE LEADER YOUR FAMILY AND ALSO AS A FATHER IN PARTICULAR HOW DO YOU APPLY THESE SAME SORTS OF IDEAS WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR KID IS GONE OF DOWN BECAUS 'SHARD TO BE OF FOURTEEN YEAR OLD OR BECAUSE IT WAS A BAD DAY OR WHEN THEY'RE UP RIGHT I THINK THE UPSTATES ARE AS INTERESTING AS THE DOWN STATES LIKE YES LIKE GOT THE DEGREE GOT THE WIND HOW MUCH DO YOU LET THEM CELEBRATE BEFORE YOU LIKE HAYLISTEN YOU KNOW YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF ANOTHER COUPLE MILLY LEADERS OF OIL IN YOUR CANDLE WE CAN DO WITH THAT YOU CAN BURN IT ERE YOUGAN A SAVE IT FOR THE NEXT THINGS YOU CAN CLIMB THE STAIRCASE WELL CLEARLY IT'S A VERY SIMILAR THING TO WHAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW IF YOUR KID IS DOING WELL AND AND WINS THE RESTLING TOURNAMENT AND IS LIKE I WANT THE RESTING TOURNAMENT AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THEY WANT TO EAT IF TRIPLE CHEES PETES HENRY THEY WENE TO GO CRAZY AND YOU AS A LEADER AND AS A AND AS A PARENT AND AS A FRIEND NEED TO SAY AMAN I MEAN YOU DID GOOD THAT WAS OSSIP YET A GREAT DAY BUT LET'S SHORT THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NEXT WEEK TO HOW BUT WE JUST HAVE A FEW SLICES TO PETES AT RIGHT AS A REWARD SO THIS IS THIS THE SAME IN ANY SITUATION THAT YOU COULD BE IN INTERACTING WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS YOU WANT TO BE THE PERSE IN THAT KIND OF MODUATES THE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE EGO OR THE WAY YOU PUT IT YOU KNOW THE DOPA MEAN AND AND THE CELEBRATORY ACTIVITIES SO NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE AND AND THIS GOES WITH YOURSELF AS WELL YOU KNOW YOU YOU DO SOMETHING YOU HAVE A SUCCESS AND YOU SAY AL THAT THAT THAT'S GREAT A BUT ALL GLORY IS FLEETING AND I NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK AND YOU LOOK AND DO PEOPLE GO TOO FAR WITHOUT SOMETIMES YES ABSOLUTELY SOMETIMES PEOPLE THEY THEY DON'T STOP AND CELEBRATE IT ALL AND THOSE THE KIND OF PEOPLE I THINK THEY GET BURNED OUT EVENTUALLY BECAUSE THEY NEVER SAY HEY THAT WAS OSSOM WE HAD A BIG WENT COOL HIGH FIVE THEY DON'T EVEN SAY THAT SO I THINK YOU DON'T AS A LEADER AS A FRIEND AS A PARENT AS A SPOUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO MODULATE THAT HELP MODULATE THAT DON'T SHUT IT DOWN YOU NOW YOUR KID WALKS OFF THE RESTLING MAT WIFOR A HIG FIVE AND YOU SAY YOU COULD ONE BY MORE NO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT OR YOUR KID WALKS OFF THE MAT AFTER LOSING YOU SAY YOU GOT WHEN YO DESERVE NOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE THE COUNTER THE COUNTER WEIGHT TO THE EMOTIONS THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE AND AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB AS A LEADERAS A FRIEND AS A SPOUSE WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB AS A COUNTERWEIGHT THEY THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT YOU WANT A YOU WANT TO PROVIDE SOME BALANCE FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T GET OUT O CONTROL AND YOU YOU NOTICE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A DOWNFALL IT'S NORMALLY BECAUSE THEY'VE SURROUNDED THEMSELVES WITH PEOPLE THAT THERE'S NO COUNT ER TOO THERE'S NO COUNTER BALANCE YOU KNOW YIF YOU WERE MY BEST FRIEND AN I YOU I WENT OUT DRINKING LAST NIGHTAD HAD A GREAT TIME AND PARTIED ALL NIGHT AND MET A GIRL AN YOU'RE LIKE HA YALLIT'S DO TOAGAINST NIGHT EVENTUALLY WHERE WE GING TO BE WORKING O BE IN THE GUTTER SOMEWHERE BUT IF YOU SAY HEY YOU THAT WAS OSSOM BUT DON REMEMBER WE GOT SCHOOL ON MONDAY RIGHT AD YOU KINT O PULL ME BACK THAT'S WE WE GOT A FINE BALANCE IN LIFE AND OURSELVES AND IN AND WE GOT AS MUCH WE CAN'T PROVIDE BALANCE FOR OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MOTIONAL AND E ET CAUGHT UP IN WHAT THEYRE DOING AND YOU WANT IT YOU WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE BALANCED THINK ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE ARE REALLY DRAWN TO YOUR MESSAGE AND I PUT MYSELF IN THAT CATEGORY AND I MERRY TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS A VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE FROM ME DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT THE CONTOUR WAS BUT WAS THINGS WERE WERE WORKING BUT THEY WEREN'T WORKING THE WAY I WANTED THEM TOO AND I REMEMBER ARRIVING AT YOUR CONDENT FIRST THROUGH THE TEMFARRS PODCAST THEN JOCK BUT THEN THEA A VENTUR THE JOCKA WILLING PODCAST UM JO ROGU AN PODCAST OS A BE TO ONE'S AT COLICE INTRODUCE ME TO YOU IN YOUR CONTENT NOTAS REALLY A CASE OF AT THE TIME I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT WE'RE DOING SIMILAR THINGS TO ME OR THAT MATCHED MY DAILY ROUTINES IN A WAY THAT IM YOU KNOW I COULD KIND O SENERGIZE WITH IN THIS WAY I THINK ONE REASON WHY YOU ARE SO HELPFUL TO PEOPLE IS THAT NOT EVERYBODY HAS THESE FRIENDS YOU KNOW SOM YOU CAN HAVE THE FRIEND THAT'S LIKE LET'S GO OUT AND TIE ONE ON AGAIN LOT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT FRIEND OR THEY HVE A FRIEND BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY CLOSE WITH THAT PERSON THERE' SOME IDEAS NOWADAYS ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE EIGHTY PRECENT A MALES DON'T HVE A CLOSE FRIEND THAT THEY COOK I DON'T KNOW IM MEAN I'M GUESSING GIRLS AND WOMEN FEEL THE SAME TO YOU KNOW THAT T A LOTSTUFF IS SUPERFICIAL AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNICATION BU NOT A LOT OF CONNECTION IGHT AND SO I THINK THAT YOU AND A FEW OTHER PEOPLE IN THE LET'S CALL IT SOCIAL MEDIA PUBLIC FACE PUBLIC FACING SPACE SERVE AS ARCHITYPES OF LIKE THE FRIEND THAT'S GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE UP GREAT BUT LET'S CLAMP IT AFTER A WHILE OR THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOWN LET'S GET GOING AND HEAR'S HOW YOU GET GOING AND SO I DO WANT A HIGH LIKE THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S BUT ONE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOUR MESSAGE AND THE MESSAGE OF SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THEIR TRYING TO DO SOMILAR THINGS BUT YOU IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE YES YOU HAV THIS MILITARY BACKGROUND VERY INTENSE MILITARY BACKGROUND WAR TIME BACKGROUND BUT ALSO YOU BRING IT INTO THE DAILY ROUTINES THAT CERTAINLY APPLIED EVERYBODY YOU KNOW MOST EVERYBODY CAN ACTS US NON HE DID WATER MI ONE WOULD HOPE A THERE'S ANOTHER DIMENSION TO THIS THAT I WANT TO JUST BRING UP AND GET YOUR REFLECTIONS ON AS IT RELATES TO MILITARY WORK SCHOOL RELATIONSHIP FAMILY ET CETERA WHICH IS THIS SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTOITIVE IDEA BUT THEM ONCE YOU HEAR IT IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE WHICH IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CATACOLA MEANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DRIVE AND THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY ABOUT WHEN WE'RE FORWARD CENTERE OF MASS AND WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE LEVEL THE INTENSIY O THE CANDLE ON THE LEVEL OF THE OIL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE ACTUALLY MAP TOO EXACTLY WE COULD PROBLY FIGURED OUT AN WE REALLY PARSTIT BUT THAT'S THE THEAT THE IDEA HERE THE ANALOGY IN A KIND OF SURPRISING WAY WE KNOW THAT FOR SURE ONE WAY TO RESTORE LEVELS OF MOTIVATION DRIVE ENTHUSIASM AND TO SOME DEGREE CONFIDENCE THAT THINGS COULD BE DIFFERENT IS THROUGH DEEP REST THINGS LIKE SLEEP RIGHT WHEN THINGS ARE REALLY REALLY HARD WHEN KIDS ARE JUST LIKE TH THEY'RE LIKE FALLIN O PART YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE YOU PUT HIM TO SLEEP THEY WAKE UP AND THEY LIKE DELIGHTFUL THAT IT RUNG AROUND THE PAJAMAS WHEN THE'RE LITTLE AND A TEEN AGER WAKES UP AFTER A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP THEY MIGHT BE A LIKE SURLY BUT WE'RE BACK ADULTS ARE LIKE THIS THE WORLD IS FALLING APART GO TO SLEEP MAKE UP OH I MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THIS KIND OF MIND SET SO SLEEP AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS WE KNOW THAT PLAY THE SORT OF THAT THE KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OR MENTAL ACTIVITY WHERE IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE COM EDITIVE BUT THE STAKES ARE LOW AND IT'S REALLY MORE ABOUT CONNECTION WITH THE ACTIVITY OR CONNECTION WITH SOMEBODY ELSE LIKE WE'RE GOING TO PLAY A GAME OF WHATEVER YOU KOW WON'T PLAY JUST WITH LAKKASO KICK MY ASKED WHEN TOU JID DO WITH ETHER Y YOU'L BEAT ME UP BOTH OF YOU KINDLY BUT YOU'LL DO IT BUT YOU KNOW LIKE A REAR TO PLAY A GAME IT'S JUST USLY HOW WE MIGHT BE LOO COMPETIVE BUT THE STAKES ARE LOW RIGHT WE KNOW THAT PLAY AND SOCIAL CONNECTION AND SLEEP ARE BASICALLY THE RESERV WAR WIT THE LOCATION THAT YOU GO TO REFILL THE OIL IN THE CANDLE EVERY SINGLE TIME AND SO FOR YOU WHERE DO THOSE THINGS PLAY INTO YOUR ROUTINE YOUN YOU MENTINING CAN GO HORRID ALL DAY AND THEN IN THE EVENING IS IT DINNER WITH FAMILY TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE AT HOME AND WHAT'S THAT LOOK LIKE I KNOW WHE'RE CON A PARSING AND I DON'T WANT O CARVE INTO YOUR YOU'N YOU'R PERSONAL LIFE TOO DEEPLY OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE BOUNDARIES THERE BUT WAS THAT LOOK LIKE IS IT EVERYONE AT THE TABLE PHONES AWAY AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DAY WORS IT YOU KNOW YET SURE WITH US A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AS I THINK IT ISN'T IMPORTANT A CONTOUR TO WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT MOST PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE A WINDOW INTO YES SO O FIRST OF ALL 'MIN JUST THE REFILLING THE TANK WITH GAMES I MEAN THAT'S WOR JUGITUAS I YOU'RE GING O GO AND YO'E N HAVE SOCIAL CONNECTION WITH PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT TALK TO PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO JOKE ABOUT WHATEVER THAN YOUE GINGTO ROLL YOU'N HAVE A GOOD TIME ROLLING YOURE INTO GET ALL SWEAT ON YOU'RE ON TO FEEL GOOD THAN YRE GING O HIGE FIVE LIKE THERE'S HUGE THAT THAT'S THERE AND YOU'RE BRAIN IS KIND OF OFF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING YOU GET TO AT A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT CAN BE THINKING ANY MORE SINTHING WITH SURFING YOU GO SURFING AND YOU YOU CATCH A WAVE EM IN YOU'R YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT OH I NEED TO PUT MY BALANCE OVER YOURE NOW IT'S HAPPENING IN YOU'RE HAVING GOOD TIME SO I WOULD SAY THAT RESTORATION FOR ME COMES FROM THOSE TWO THINGS FOR SURE ANDTHENYOUHVMING MY MY WIFE AND MY KIDS WHEN I GET HOME IN ENENT MY KIDS ARE OLDER

THINGS I'VE SEEN OF YOU AND IT GETS ME BACK TO THIS THING THAT CAME UP A THE BEGINNING I'D REALLY LIKE TO RE TURN TO IS THAT YOU SEEM TO HAVE A VERY STRONG SENSE OF CONTECT AND SELF I TO SAY IT I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST EM I HERE TO PLAY ONE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED WAS THAT OCE IN ONE CONTAECT YOU KNOW T MADE SENSE TO BE STRAIGHT EDGE YOU MENTION MINOR THROUGAT GREAT BAND STRAIGHT EDGE BAND BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO YOUN YOU RUN AROUND WITH YOUR FRIENDS THEN AND IT MADE SENSE TO BE YOU KNOW WITHOUT A'LCALL OR DRUGS ARE ANTHNG AT THAT STAGE AND THAN YOU GET INTO ANOTHER CONTACT IT'S LIKE OQE I CAN DO THIS I CAN DRINK AND STILL PERFORM WELL AND DO ALL THINGS THAT NEED TO DO AND THN WHEN THAT CLOSE IS OUT I'MINE I WHEN TO DO SOMETHING ELSE AND SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND OF A CAMELION RIGHT THEY THEY'RE SWITCHING THEMSELVES DEPENDING ON THE CONTACT THAN THEY'RE KIND OF  GETTING ACCENTS WHEN THERE IN ONE LOCATION OR ANOTHER BUT THAT'S NOT YOU IT ALL I GET I CAN TELL WITH WITH CERTAINTY THAT'S NOT YOU AD ALL THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A VERY STRONG SENSE OF SELF SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE A SENSE OF SELF THAT'S FIRM WE CAN GO INTO DIFFERENT CONTACT WE CAN EVEN CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR BUT WE DON'T LOSE WHO WE ARE WHICH MEANS WE CAN ALWAYS RE TURN TO THAT THE IMAGE OF MY MINE IS LIKE I I'VE DONE AN ELUBITOUS CUPIDIVING NOT A LOT BUT THEY'RE DURING SOME OF THE MORE ADVANCE TRAINING FOR OSSIDE THIS WASN'T SEAL TRAINING IT OF COURSE WAS EAN A FOLLOWING A LINE IN THE DARK LIKE A NIGHT DIVE N YOU'RE FALLING A LINE AND YOU KNOW SONE AS YOU'RE NAVIGATING WITH TOOLS BUT SOMETHING YOU'RE FOLLOWING A LINE UNDER WATER AND THIS IDEA THAT LIKE YOU CAN LET GO OT THAT LINE BUT YT YOU REMEMBER WHER IT IS YIN CAN RE TURN TO IT THAT'S COND OF HOW I IMAGINE THE SENSE OF SELF BECAUSE IN DIFFERENT CONTECTS MOST HEALTHY PEOPLE MODIFY THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT WE ACT DIFFERENTLY AT A WEDDING OR A FU NERAL THAN WE DO IN CLASS OR WITHAUT YOU KNOW WITH OUR FRIENDS OF COURSE IMPORTANT PART OF BEING A HUMAN FUNCTION OF HUMAN SO SEEMS TO ME THAT FROM A PRETTY EARLY STAGE YOU HAD PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF SELF NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SIT IN YOUR ROOM AND MEDITATE ON LIKE WHO IS JOCKA WILLINCON LIKE TOUCH THAT THAT THAT CENTRAL CORRD OF SELF I'M GUESSING YOU DON'T BUT AS I SAY THIS I HAVE TO ASK WAS THERE SOMETHING IN YOUR UP BRINGING YOUR PARENTS OR SO OR WAS IT JUST KIND OF HOW YOU ALWAYS MAGINE YOURSELF AS LIKE YE THIS IS WHO I AM LIKE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AROUND ME LIKE I KIND OF KNOW WHO I AM EVEN IF I'M ENGAGING IN SOME OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT I MIGHTNOT DO IN ANOTHER CONTENTLY I KNOW WHO I AM CAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE A VERY FIRM SENSE OF SELF OR THER SENSE OF SELF IS SO RIGID THAT THEY CAN ONLY OPERATE IN THIS LIKE NARROW TRENCH OF ONE DOMAIN OF LIFE AND THEY AND A VERY VERY ISOLATED I'D LOOKE FOR YOU TO CANT A SHARE WITH US WHAT YOUR RECOLLECTIONS ARE A COUND LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU REALIZED I'M NI LIKE YEL LIKE I'M GOOD IN A BUNCH O IFFERENT PLACES I'M SAFE FOR I'M WHATEVER CAUSE I THINGS IS ALSO RELATES TO CONFIDENCE YOU KNOW I'M GLAD YOU  ARE GIVING ME THE BENEFIT THE DOUBT ON GOING IN THE TEAMS AND AND BEIN LIKE A MAN LOOKS LIKE GO TO DRINK IN AND I HAVEN'T REALLY DRANK BEFORE AND SEEMS LIKE THESE GOES ER HAVEN'T A GOOD TIME WIT TO HAVE O GOD TIME WITH THESE GUIES AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I DID RIGHT AM AS FAR AS AND YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT NOW AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME YOU KNOW I LOOK AT ALCOHOL NOW AS JUST I'VE SEEN SO I'VE SEEN IT DESTROY SO MANY PEOPLE THAT I'VE NOW KIND OF LOOK AT IN GO MAN I DON'T I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD DRINK U AND LOOK I GET IT I'M I'M KIND EXAMPLE IC I USED TO DRINK AND GO I'T HAVE A GOOD TIME AD IT WASN'T AT PING OF DEAL TO NEGATIVELY IMPACK ME IN SOME DRAMATIC WAY BUT I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS THAT IT IS HORRIBLE FOR IT IS ALL BUT RUINED THEIR LIVES AND YOU KNOW IT'S TOTALLY LEGAL WHICH IS KIND OF BAZAAR AM SO I THINK THAT FIGURING THAT OUT WHEN I LOOK BACK IN IT AND THE COLTURE IN THE SEAL TEAMS WAS FEIRY THERE WAS VERY ALCOHOL CENTRIC AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE IUN ALL THAT YOU GOT LIKE IT JUST LIKE A FRATERNITY IS ALCOHOL CENTRIC OR A OR A A FOOTBALL TEAM IS OW COULD YOU GET A MUNCH OF YOUNG DUDE THAT AR GOIT TO DRINK AND HAVE A GOOD TIME SO IT JUST SORT OF A A YOUNG DO'D KIND OF THING AND UNFORTUNATELY IIT ENDS UP RUINING A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEY MAKE BAD DECISIONS IN TO DO STUPID THINGS AND IT IS NOT GOOD AND I THINK THE CULTURES MOVING AWAY FROM THAT A LITTLE BITINES SEAL TEAMS UM YOU KNON'T MI MY ALCOHOL BRIEF USED TO SAY U NICELY TO TELL MY GIS IF YOU GO OUT YOU GULD O DO I YOU GET PUT IN JAIL FOR A FIGT YOU GET HURT BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING DRUNK YOU JUST DID ALKITIS JOB FOR THEM YOU JUST DID ALKOTTAS IT THEY WANT TO TAKE YOU OFF THE BATTLE FIELD AND YOU JUST TOOK YOURSELF OFF ABOUT FWIL YOU CAN'T GONT APPOYMENT NOW AND AD THAT WOULD ALWAYS HIT GUIS ND I THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THE SEAL TEAMS KIND OF LEANING IN THAT DIRECTION MORE REALIZING THE NEGATIVE NEGATIVITY OF ALCOHOL I WISH I WOULD HAVE REALIZE THAT EARLIER I WISH I WOULD AVE BE A BETTER LEADER AND RECOGNIZE THAT AN EARLIER STAGE AND RECOGNIZE THAT JUST BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF GETTING AWAY WITH IT MEANING IT DIDN'T REALLY I DIDN'T  DIDN'T WAKE UP TIE ONE OF O THATTER CAN WECD GET TR I NEVER I NEVER Y HAD THAT FEELING I WISH I WOULDNAT REALIZE THAT THERE'S OTHER GUISE IT DO AND YOU KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE THAT CAN OPERATE AND BE FUNCTIONAL AND IT DOESN'T BEALLY IM PACK THEIR LIVES BUT THE'S LOT PEOPLE IT DON'T AND I DON'T THINK IT'SO WORK THE DICE ROLL TO TO START DRINKING I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH THE DET'S WHAT WHAT HE GET OUT OF IT SO I THINK THAT OVER ALL THAT'S WHY IF YOU WHEN I THINK ABOUT ALCOHLEGES THINK ABOUT ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE LIVES THAT IT'S RUINED ND I DON'T LIKE IT AND I WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PROBABLY NOT GOOD AND WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS AND UNFORCING I DIDN'T AND I TRYING CONVEY THAT MESSAGE AS MUCH AS I CAN NOW AND IT DID BRING ME BACK TO MY ROOTS BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID IT WAS LIKE ALCOHOL IS WEAK AND YOU LOOK AT THESE GUIS THEY THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE ACTING LIKE IDIOTS I'M NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THAT AND SO YOU KNOW AS I GOT OLDER ONCE I GOT AL THE SILTIMES I KIND OF WENT BACK TO THAT A AS FAR AS KIND OF WEAR I BECAME ME I I JUST ACTUALLY HAVE TO KIND ON GIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO THE MUSIC THAT I GREW UP LISTENING TO AND THE ATTITUDE THAT WE HAD BACK THEN LISTENING TO HARDCORN MUSIC BEING ABLE TO STAND UP AGAINST WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WERE SAYING WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT SCENE AND THE WHOLE DI WY NATURE OF IT HEY WE WEAKNES DO THIS OURSELVES WEKJUST MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR OURSELVES WE DON'T NEED ANY WE DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE WE CAN DO THIS AND THAT HARD COR ATTITUDE AN STICKING BY YOUR FRIENDS AND STANDING UP AND GETTIN FIGHTING LIKE THAT'SWHAT YOU'RE GING TO DO THAT'S KIND OF MY ATTITUDE AND I GOT INTERVIEWED FOR A SO DOCUMENTARY THAT THEY'RE MAKING ABOUT HARDLY FLANT AGAIN AND AND THE CROMAGS AND YOU KNOW   WHEN WHEN I WAS A KID AND ACTILLY THROUGH MY WHOLE LIFE LIKE THAT WAS THAT THAT MUSIC IS THE SOUND TRACK OF MY LIFE AND SO I ALWAYS WOULD HAVE THAT MUSIC RUNNING IN MY HEAD BUT TO YOUR QUESTION I HAD SOMETHING IN ME THAT WHEN I HEARD THAT MUSIC FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS LIKE ULKA THAT HER IT IS YOU DON'T HEAR IT IS THIS IS YOU KNOW I HEAR THE BEADLES I HEAR THE GRATEFUL DEAD I HEAR THE ROLLING STONES I HEAR THE WHOEVER AND YOU GO OKI HIT'S FIME BUT WHEN I HEARD HARDCORN MUSIC FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I HEARD THE CROW MAGS I HEARD O NOSTIC FROM I HEARD A BAD BRAINS I THOUGHT IT WAS THAT WAS JUST LIKE IT WAS PART OF ME ALREADY AND THEN IT WAS THE ATTITUDE AND ANDAGAN YOU CAN LISTEN TOF MY PODCAS WITH HARLY FLAND AGAIN THE WAY I'VE YEWED HARLY FLANTING IN THE WAY I'VE VIEWED THE CROW MAGS WAS NOT THE WAY THEY ACTUALLY WORK I' BEAN YOU DO HARLY WAS DOING DRUGS I' ME HORRIBLE DRUGS USE ON HAIRN EVERYTHING ELSE BUT HIS IMAGE WAS WAS LIKE STRAIGHT EDGED KIND OF SPIRITS WILL THEY HAD ALL THAT STUFF GOING ON AND I THOUGHT O KABLE THAT'S WITHOUT I HDIDN'T KNO I MIKE A KID LIVING IN THE WOODS AND CONNECTICUT I I'VE JUST CAN  HEARING WHAT I'M HEARING HE LISTEN TO THE LYRICS LISTEN TOE LYRICS OF MINER THREAT LISTEN TO LYRICS AND YOU OK THI STUFF I AGREE WITH THE STUFF AND I I JUST THINK THAT THAT KIND OF KIND OF SET MY MY KND OF SAID A DAT UM IN MY HEAD OF BEING O K WITH BEING OUTSIDE BEING O K WITH SAYING NO BEING O K WITH BEING REBEL BEING O K WITH NOT GOING ALONG WITH WHAT EVERY ONE ELSE IS DOING AND THAT KAME THI BECAME VERY IMPORTANT WHEN I WAS IN THE MILITARY AND I LOOKED IT WHAT LEADERSHIP MIGHT BE TELLING ME TO DO AND MIGHT THINK MYSELF HAY THAT DOESN'THING LIKE A GOOD IDEA AND HAVING THE THE WEREWITH ALL TO SAY HAYBOSS ON NOT SHOW THIS A GOD IDEA NOT TO BE A JERK ABOUT IT BUT JUST TO SAY THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY TO GET THE STONE WOULD YOU THINK OF THIS OR HABOSS CAN ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THAT SO I I THINK IF I HAD TO TRACE IT BACK YOU KNOW HAVING BLACK FLAG MY WAR SIDE TOO ON MY RECORD PLAYER FOR LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF STRAIGHT THAT'S GOIN TO LEV E MARK  AND I THINK IT LEFT THE MARK ON ME I LOVE WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND WHEN I SAY LOVE I REALLY MEAN IT BECAUSE AS WE BOTH KNOW WE SHARE A COMMON LOVE FOR SERTAIN MUSIC IN PARTICULAR MINOR THREATANS SONE STUFF FROM THE PUNKOK SEENG IN PARTICULAR FOR ME THE NORTH EAST PUNKCROK SEEING THE BRUISERS Y I'LL BARR FROM THE BRUISERS NOW PEOPLE KNOWM AS THE LEAST IN FOR THE DROPTIC MURFHYS WE COR THAT'S THE BREWS AND WE WE WE RUN THE RISK OF GOING DEEP DOWN A RABIT HULL OF OF MUSIC THAT MOST PEOPLE MAYRE MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH TETHOUGH MUST PEOPLE HEAR THE DROP CAKES BUT I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YOU I MEAN I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME HEARING STIFF LO FINGERS OR RANCID AND EVEEN BAUNCING SOULS I FOR NEW JERS NOT EVEN BAUNCING SO SORRY SIR IT'S ARRY BEHIND I GREGG LIKE NO THEL BALLANCING SOULS AN GOING YES THAT THAT'S ME THAT'S IT KBUT AS YOU SAID IT WAS ALREADY KIND OF IN YOU IT'S LIKE A RECOGNITION AND I BRING THIS UP AND I WANT A HIGH LIGHT ITN NOT BECAUSE WE SHARE THIS ALTHOUGH I DO FIND THAT TO BE AN AMAZING KINSHIP THAT WE FELT RIGHT AWAY AND WAS LIKE WE PROBLY RIFF FOR TWENTY FIVE HOURS JUST ON THAT BUT IT BRINGS HIM BACK THIS IDEA THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT MY IDEA I SHU THE FIRST TIME I HEARD ABOUT IT WAS FROM ROBERT GREEN WHO WROTE THE BOOK MASTERY AND I'M SOME IMPORTANT WRITINGS YOU KNOW I VERY WHAT WAS IT I THINK IT WASLY FORGET HOW MANY LAWS OF POWER BUT THOSE BOOKS ROBER BE MASTERY'S ACTULY A BOOK THAT I HIGHL Y RECOMMEND PEOPLE READ BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT MENTORSHIP IN FINDING MENTORS AN THE FACT THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BREAK UP AND MOVE ON FROM MENTORS AND THAT MENTORS AREN'T ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW OR THAT KNOW US ET CETERA AMAZING BOOK REALLY A BUT HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON I EVER HEARD DESCRIBE THIS IDEA THAT IF WE THINK BACK LONG ENOUGH THERE'S SOME SEED MOMENT IT WAS SHOPPING FOR THE PANTS TAT SOMETHING IT WAS BUT ALSO MUSIC WHERE YOU SEE SOMETHING AN IT S LIKE YES THAT'S ME AND I'M NAT AND THEN THAT BECOMES A SORT OF SOUND TRACK OR VISUAL IMAGE OR SOMETHING FOR YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CARRY FOR IT WITH YOU THE NURROW SCIENTISTS AND ME WANTS TO SAY THAT THAT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE REALLY TAP IN TO THIS DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT IS UNIQUE TO US BECAUSE EVERY CHILD RESPONSE TO FOOD WITH A LOWL BIT OF DON'T BEMAN WHEN WE'RE HUNGRY RESPONSE TO WARMTH WHEN WE'RE COLD RESPONSE TO AT WARM A DRY DIPER AFTER WE JUST WET OURSELVES WHICH WE ALL DID YOU KNOW I NOT MAYBE JOCKA YOU CHANGE YOUR OWN DIPERS AH BUT I'M GUESSING IT SOE ONE CHANGE YOUR DIVER AT ONE POINT NOT AN IMAGE PATH WE NEED O GO DOWN BUT THE IDEAS THAT WE ALL HAVE THESE UNIVERSAL SOURCES OF KIND OF HAVING OUR NEEDS MET GOING FROM DISCOMFORT TO COMFORT AND BACK AGAIN WHICH IS BASICALLY CHILDHOOD BUT AT SOME POINT SOMETHING COMES ALONG THAT WE REALLY FEEL AS UNIQUE TO US AND IT MAYBE THE THING THAT EVERYONE ELSE LIKES MAYBE IT'S TOP FORTY OR WHATEVER IT IS MAYBE 'S THE SHOE THAT EVERYONE'S WEARING AND IT THAT SEEMS GOOD BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND OF TEN OR TWENTY OR MABE EVEN A HUNDRED N EIGHTY DEGREES OFF FROM WHAT EVERYONE ELSE LIKES IN THE LIKE THAT THING IS WHAT'S REALLY COOL AND IT'S A FELT THING AND SO ALONG THE LINES OF FELT THINGS AS OPPOSE TO THINGS THAT EVERY ONE VALUES WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES OF MOTIVATION AND I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT SOME OF THEM ARE INTERNAL WE COUL POINT AHEAD OR WE COULD POINT O HEART DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BUT LIKE WHEN YOU THINK OF SOURCES OF MOTIVATION DO YOU HAVE A PALATE OF THEM THAT YOU CAN DIP IN TO DO YOU EVEN FEEL THE NEED TO DIP INTO THEM OR AS IT REALLY JUST ALL ABOUT ACTION STEPS THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY OR IF I CAN EVEN VENTURE UNTO T THE SOMEWHAT YOU KNOW HARDER STORIES THAT I'VE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT YOU SOMETIMES THINK BACK AND IT LISTEN OMIN A DO THIS BECAUSE YOUR BUNCH A GUIES THAT OR DEAD NOW THAT CAN'T AND SOMEMON TO DO IT BECAUSE I CAN WHAT ARE YOUR WHAT ARE THE PAINTS ON YOUR MOTIVATION PALITE IF YOU WILL WELL YOU PRO YOU PROBABLY HEARD ME SAR THAT MOT MOTIVATION ISN'T SOMETHING THAT I AM GOING TO COUNT ON BECAUSE IT'S JUST AN A MOTION THAT'S CAN TA COMMON GO AND IT'S JUST LIKE FEELING HAPPY YOU FEEL HAPPIER ANT NOW MAYBEFEEL HAPPY IN FIFTY MINUTES YOU FEEL SAD NOW MAYBE FEEL HAVN FIFTY MINUTES FEEL MOTIVE ADER RIGHT NOW YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL MOTIVATING FIFTY MINUTES THEREFORE I CAN'T RELY ON IT SO I'M NOT GOING TO PUT ANY N ICIN PUT ANY MONEY ON JUST BEING MOTIVATED BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME SO THE DAILY ACTIONS THAT I TAKE AREN'T FROM MOTIVATION THERE THEY'RE JUST FROM DISCIPLINE LIKE  LEKE I SAID EARLIER IRE NOT GONG TO GET UP AND GO THROUGH SOME BIG DEBATE ABOUT WELL RELASH YOU I REALLY FEEL LIKE DOING THIS NOW I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING BUT HIS MATTER SOMPS CAN TO GO DO IT NOW IF WE START TO LOOK AT SORT OF A BROADER MOVEMENT THROUGH LIFE AND CONTINUING TO TRY AND MOVE FORWARD AND MOVE ON YOU KNOW A MY BUDY SEFF DIED AND HE WAS THA DEALT U PO TUNE COMMANDER IN TASKING TO BRUISER AND HE HE DIED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND HE WAS AN A PARISHUT ACCIDENT AND IT WAS IT WAS I MEAN IT'S DEAFILY UNEXPECTED A AND AN ALSO HE'D ALREADY BEEN THROUGH MULTIPLE DEPLOYMENTS A WAS WITH WITH US WITH ME IN THE BATTLE OR MODY HE THEN WENT BACK IN OSOTTER CITY IN AND LED A TON OF VERY DANGEROUS OPERATIONS AND THEN HE DID OTHER DEPLOYMENTS AND WAS KIND OF DONE WITH HIS DEPLOYMENTS CON A DONE AND NOW HE'S JUST TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE'S GIN A RETIRE AND HE'S A COUPLE YEARS AWAY FROM RETIREMENT AND YOU KNOW I'M TALKING ABOUT PAY WORKING TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN AND IT ALL SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ON A PRETTYGOOD PATH TO JUST MOVE FORWARD AND THEN HE ENDS UP DYING IN IN A INA PARASHUTE ACCONN AND HE'S A GUY THAT YOU KNOW WAS REALLY JUST KIND AT YOUYOYOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO REPLACE AND HE A ANY YOU KEE CAN'T THERE'S A UNIQUENESS TO HIM THAT IS YOU'RE NOT GAN TIFIND AND AU NI'VE GOT SOME STUFF THAT HE WROTE HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE WRITER AND I'LL LIKE TRYIN WRITE SOMETHING LIKE HIM I CAN'T WE CAN'T DO IT CAUSE HE HAD A BIGGER VOCABULARY AND A MORE ARTICULATE WAY OF WRITING AND SO I CAN'T WRITE ANYTHING AS WELL AS HE WROTE HE WAS INCREDIBLE AT GUITAR HE PLAYED GUITAR PLAYED YOU CALAILY LIKE SICK  LIKE AN INCREDIBLE AT PLAYING GUITAR AND HE'S A TOTAL KNUCKLE DRAGGER LIKE A TOTAL MEET HEAD KNUCKLE DRAGGER YOU KNOW HIS NICKNAME WAS UNFROZEN CAVE MAN BECAUSE HE JUST HE JUST A YOU KNO LOOK LIKE A BIG CAVE MAN AND YET HE SPOKE FRENCH AND YOU KNOW COULD RECITE FRENCH POETRY AND WAS REALLY GOOD AT LEARNING LANGUAGES AND HE WAS AN ARTIST AND HE HAD YOU WHAT SENSENESIGIA IS YOU KNOW THAT IS EMERGING OF THE SEN SISCIPE WE THEY CAN SEE COLORS AND SO HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS OTHER I SEE COLORS OUT MOST PEOPLE CAN SEE COLORS I SORRY THAT CAN HEAR COLORS AND UM AND CAN ASSOCIATE PARTICULAR COLORS WITH SOUNDLY LIKE I PERTULAR KEYS ON THE PIANO IT'S IT SU IT'S PRETTY RARE YET SOMEPEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE IT BUT TRUE SIN AS THEGICS AR PRETTY RARE BUT UM THEY DON'T HAVE TO FIGHTE FOR THIS TRAITE AJUS KIND OF EMERGES FOR THEM HE DIDN'T KNOW IT BUT ONE DAY HE WAS TANKING ME AND HE WAS EMBARRASSED TO TELL ME HE'S LIKE YOU KNOW WIT'S WEIRDESS OU WHEN I WHEN I THINK OF NUMBERS I I HAVE COLORS IN MY HEAD AND AND I GO WHATD YEU MEAN HN' HE SAYS HOLLOW WAS ZERO AND I REMEMBER SEVEN IS YELLOW DON'TREMEMBER ANY OTHER BUT HE HE JUST RATTLED OFF LIKE ONE TO THREE FOR FIVES OR SEVEN EIGHT NINE YOU KOW HE SAYS YOU KNOW HOLLOW WHITE CLEAR ALL O E KNO JUST RATTLED OFF THESE COLORS SO HE HAD THIS THIS HE HAD THAT SENCETION AND IT GAVE HIM SOME KIND OF WEIRD ABILITY TO MEMORIZE NUMBERS SO YOU KNOW HE'D BEING A BAR AND TALK TO SOME GIRL AND HE SAIY WHAT YOUR NUMBER AND HE WOULD JUST NEVE KNOW IT FOR TWO YEARS HE WOULD JUST KNOW IT AND THAT ALSO MADE HIM INCREDIBLY GOOD AT PLAYING GITAR BECAUSE NOW LIKE THE SCALE AND THE FRET BOARD OF A CUITAR AS THIS IT'S A MATHEMATICAL THING THAT HE HAS ALL IN THIS WEIRD THIS WEIRD COLORATION SCENARIO GOING ON SO THERE'S SO HE'S THIS GUY AND YOU KNOW AN AND VERY A VERY EMOTIONAL GUY A VERY EMOTIONAL GUY WHO WOULD YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I WAS TALKING EARLIER ABOUT BEING A BALANCE FOR SOME ONE I HAD TO BALANCE THIS DUDOU ON A DAILY BASE IS SOMETIMES YOU KNOW HE'D BE SO MAD ABOUT SOMETHING YOU ONE ONE DAY I HATE THE TEAMS I A ALWAYS GUYSE AND ID SAY IN I'D GET A MAN AND THE NEXT DAY ILE NEVER GETTING OUT OF THE TEAN NOW HE  HE WOULD OSCILLATE THAT THAT AND I WOULD TELL HIM HAY YOUR HAYBRO YOU'R OSCILLATING AGAIN AND JUST W WOULD DO ANYTHING AND HE AND HE LOVED HIS GUYSE AND WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HIS GUYSE AND UM SO WHEN HE GUIED YOU KNOW WHERE I WHEREAT IS WEREAT IS IT'S NOT AS FUNERAL

WHO WORKS WITH US AT AS ON FRONT HOURS WITH US IN REMODIAND WAS VERY CLOSE TO SATH AN AND WEIR LIKE EVERY ONE KIND OF CLEARED OUT FOR US AND UM WE WE GO IN THERE AND I THINK J P GAVE HIM J P HAD ONE OOSE MEMORIAL BRACELETS WITH GUY'S NAMES ON IT THAT IT DIED IN J P A GAVE THAT TO HIM AND THINK LAFE GAVE HIM SOME SIRF WAXCAUS ALSO SOUTH WAS A WAS A SURFER AND UM AND I GAVE  SA HIS BLACK BELT CAUSE

HAVE THEY WINL'L HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GET UP IN THE MORNING SO THAT'S WHAT IT IS MAAM I WON'T FAIL TOS GAS THANKS FOR SHAREIN THAT IM YE HINK OT ANYONE LESS IN THIS FEELS WHAT I FEEL RIGHT NOW WHICH IS IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE THE DEPTH OF EMOTION FOR PEOPLE THAT WE CARE ABOUT AND LOSE IS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH OUR LOVE FOR THEM THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION ABOUT IT IT THE GRIEF AND LOVE ARE SO AND INTSIMATELY TIED THEYV THERE DIRECT REFLECTION OF ONE ANOTHER AND I YOU KNOT I HESITATE TO GOT A STAY ON HARD THEMES BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT M FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS LAST TIME WE SPOKE WHIT WAS IN YOUR OFFICE AND IM YOUR PODCAST AND AFTER WE WRAPPED UT WHWE STARTED TALKING ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WE KNOW AND SOMETHINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND CONT AS SPOOLED INTO SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THINGS THAD HAPPENED AND NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND CIVILIAN CULTURE AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SO PERPLEXING I THINK TO PEOPLE I INCLUDING ME BUT MAYBE WITH TIME LESS SO AND T AT THIS ITION CAME UP LAST NIGHT IN DISCUSSION I'M AT HOME CAUSE OF SOME RECENT EVENTS NOT CLOSE TOMME BUT SHIS THAT Y SOME PEOPLE GO THROUGH THINGS WHERE THERE'S LOSS THEY GO THROUGH LIFE IN THERE'S HARDSHIP IT MUST PEOPLE EXPERINC SOME HARDSHIP CERTAINLY SOME MORE THAN OTHERS AND EVERY ONE'S IN A WHILE AND FAR TOO OFTEN AND EVEN IN THE SEALTIN COMMUNITY AND EVEN IN THE VARIES COMMUNIES WITHIN THE SEALTING COMMUNITY WHERE ONE WOULD NEVER EXPECT IT MIT THESE A HIGHLY TRAIN TIGHT COMMUNITY HARD GUIDES RIGHT THAT'S THE LANGUAGE SOME WE SOMETIMES HERE BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT THEYUSR PEOPLE OFTEN TH HAVE TREMENDOUS EMOTIONAL DEPTH AND I'M SO GLAD T YOU BROUGHT THAT OP CAUSE I THINK WE AH YOU KNOW HE SOMETIMES THINK OF HIS MOTION AS WEAKNESS BUT YOU'RE THERE WAS A TIME NOT LONG AGO FORTY FIFTY YEARS AGO WHERE EMOTIONS LIKE JEALOUSY AND INTENSE HE THINK THE CHARACTER SUNNY AND THE GODFATHER LIKE HEU WILL GET SO PISTE YOU FARY IT ON FIST RIGHT THAS PRETTY EMOTIONAL RESPONSE UM WHERE INTENSITY AN EMOTION WERE KIND OF INTERCHANGEABLE WORDS RIGHT AT SOME LEVEL COM TO BE DIRECT THERE'VE BEEN LIKE EYES COME OUT THE SEAL TAMS IV BEEN SURPRISED TO HEAR THEY KILL THEMSELVES AND YESTERDAY THERE WAS A MAJOR SUICIDE I DIDN'T KNOW THIS SGYDE AND PRESUME WEAS HE FOLLOWED EACH OTHER ON SOCIAN MEOU BUT T I ADMITTEDLY WAS NOT CLOSE TO HIM TO KNOW HIM DO' KNOW HIM AT ALL IN FACT THES NAME WAS TWITCH OR SOMETHING IN USE THE SKY WAS A YOUS A A PUBLIC FACING FIGURE BUT LISTEN HAPPENS ALL TOO OFTEN AND IT EVEN HAPPENS IN FORMER OPERATORS AND SUICIDE SOMETHING THAT FASCINATES ME AND INTRIGUES ME AND SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME BECAUSE FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT MAPIT TO ANY SPECIFIC THING IN THE BRAIN OR BODY THAT WERE AWARE OF AND YET MY I'VE HAD SEVERAL FRIENDS COMMITT SUICIDE HAD UNDERGRATIVISE HER CMMITED SUICIDE THE POINT IS NOT THEM WERE THEIRE STORY THE POINT IS WHAT IN THE WORLD DICTATES WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY WHO HAS A COMMUNITY WHO'S DOING WELL AND THEN LESS WELL THESIDES TO OFF THEMSELVES TO END THEIR OWN LIFE VERSES YOU KNOW DECIDE I'M AN A KEEP GOING AND THIS IS I'M RAISINGIS O THE QUESTION I WISH I HADN'NT ANSWER I YOU TOHAVE IDEAS LIKE OH IT'S TIME PERCEPTION YOU KNOW WHET THESE PEOPLE ARE SO MISEFEELING SO MISERABLE THAT THEY FEELS KAN TO GO ON FOREVER BUT THEN YOU START READING THE LITERATURE ON SUICIDE I'VE START TO GO INTO THIS IT FOR THOSE AOR YOU THAT CAN STOMACH IT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT TO RECOMMEND THIS MOVYN BUT I'M JUSCIN TO SAY IT EXISTS THEY MOVIN THE BRIDGE WHERE THEY FIXE THE CAMERA ON THE GOING GATE BRIDGE FOR A YEAR TURNS OUT ONE PERSON A DAY ON AVERAGE TRIES TO JUMP OFF THE TALK TO A GOID WHO SURVIVED IT BY THE WAY HE JUMPED OFF THE MOMENT HE WENT OFF THERE HE'VE THOUGHT I WISH I HADN'T DONE THAT HE SURVIVED HIS KID WITH BY POLER BY PULLER DISORDER SPECIALLY MAILS TWENTY TO THIRTY TIMES HIGHER INCIDENCES SUICIDE MASSIV YINCREASE THE POINT IS THAT THERE' SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE BRAIN WHERE' SOMEHOW PEOPLE ALSO WILL GET THE IDEA AND YOU HEAR THIS THAT THIS IS LIKE SOMETHING THEY'RE EXCITED TO DO WHERE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RIGHT THE WORLD SOMEHOW BY DOING THIS OR THAT SOMEHOW IT'S LIKE A GIFT TO THEMSELVES AGAIN I'M NOT ENCOURAGING ANYBODY DO THIS OWNRY VERY CLEAR BUT THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU HEAR AND SADLY YOUR COMMUNITY HAS LOST A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THROUGH SUICIDE AND YET THEY'RE LOT AG GUIYES THAT THRIVE AND SO MORE AS A TEMPLET FOR TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MENTAL HEALTH AND DEPRESSION IN SUISIDE WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHY SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO THRIVE AND SOME PEOPLE JUST GO ALL HE WAY DOWN CLEARLY THERE'S ATHAT'S A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION AND THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANSWERS IN I CERTAINLY AM NOT ONE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION HOWEVER U PROBABLY WHERE MY WHERE MY THOUGHT HAS GONE ON THIS LATELY BECAUSE ENOF I'VE KNOWN SOME GUYS TIT'VE KILLED THEMSELVES AND I'VE BEEND TOTALLY SHOCKED BUT AND JUST BEEN TALKET COMPLETELY IN TOLLY SHOCKED THAT GUYS THAT I KNEW KILLED HIMSELVES GUYS THAT Y YOU WOULD THINK OF THIS GUY WOULD WOULD NEVER DO THIS A MILLIONEARS AND THAT'S THE FEELING I'VE HAD A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF THE GUYS THAT I KNOW THAT HAVE KILLED HMSELVES I HAD AA WOMAN ON MY PODCAST NAME SARA WILKINSON AND SHE'S AN AWSOME WOMAN AND SHE WAS MARRIED TO A SEAL HIS NAME WAS CHAD I DIDN'T KNOW IM UM HE KILLED HIMSELF HE AND AND TO HEAR HER DESCRIBE THE STORIE THUT THE SHOCKING THING ABOUT THE STORY IS THAT THE GUY THAT SHE KNEW N THE GUY THAT SHE MARRIED WAS NOT THE SAME GUY THAT KILLED HIMSELF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM THAT MADE HIM A DIFFERENT PERSON AND LOOK THE'RE THEY'RE GETTING ALL THIS INFORMATION NOW ABOUT C T AND THE THE THE BRAIN TRAMA THAT YOU GO THROUGH AND PEOPLE OR EXPOSED TO THAT AND I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN YOU GEORGE FORMAN HE SEEMS TOLALY NORMALINGA TO GO RIGHT AND MAHAMANALY NOT SO MUCH AND I'VE I'VE KNOWN FIGHTERS AND YOU CAN LOOK AT ANY NUMBER OF BOXERS THAT HAVE HAD A CAREER AND SOME OF THEM ARE FINE AND SOME OF THEM HAVE SOME REAL SIGNIFICANT WHAT IS A PUGILISTIC UM THERE'S IS PUGILISTIC CENTRIL RIGHT THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN PUNCHE TOO MUCH AND HAVE PROBLEMS SO DIFFERENT PEOPLE YOU CAN EXPOSE DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO BLAST BLAST IN PACT AND IS CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT IN PACT OVER TIME AND I THINK THAT  YOU KNOW AGAIN TO HEAR SARA EXPLAIN THAT STORY AND WHAT SHE SAW FROM HER HUSBAND AND HOW DIFFERENT HE WAS WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED COMPARED TO WHERE THEY ENDED UP IT'S TOLLY DIFFERENT IT'STOLLY DIFFERENT PERSON IM HAD ANOTHER A FRIEND OF MINE ON WHO NA MARKS COPONE AND HIS WIFE CAME ON WITH EM AND SHE SAID THE SAME THING LIKE THE GUY THAT SHE MARRIED WAS NOT THE SAME GUY THAT WAS READY TO KILLHIMSEFFIN AND HE DIDN'T THANKFULLY IF IT WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON AND IT'S NOT LOOK YOU KNOW IF THAT  GET YO FRED IS MARRIED TO SOME WOMAN AND FRED AN JESSI CA GROW APART OVER TUIME AN AND HE ANDS UP WITH SOME OTHER GIRL IT'S STILL THE SAME GUY RIGHT IS STILL THE SAME GUY THAT IS NOW TAT THEY GREW APART THEY'RE GETTIN TEFOREST WE GET IT BUT THE WAY THAT BOTH OF THEM DESCRIBE THEIR HUSBANDS AS BEING DIFFERENT PEOPLE IT THAT'S WHAT'S STUCK WITH ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SO I YOU KNOW AGAIN I'M I'M THROWING THIS OUT THERE ONLY BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I'VE OBSERVED THROUGH THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOWT AND AND SEEING AND HEARING THOSE STORIES OF PEOPLE BEING TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND AND I'VE KNOWN A FEW PEOPLE WONE MY FRIENDS DAVE KILLED HIMSELF A NEVER I NEVER WOULD A GUESS N MILLIONEARS THAT DAVE WOULD KILL HIMSELF IT JUST  IT DOESN'T COMPUTE IT DOESN'T COMPUTE AND SO MY SUSPICION IS THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING GOING ON MECHANICALLY OR CAMICALLY WITH THE BRAIN THAT CAUSES THEM TO GET INTO A MODE WERE TTHEY'RE DEPRESSMT DON'T SEE A WAY OUT AND THAT'S THE WAY THEY FEEL NOW AND AGAIN WHAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS AS WE AREN TO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE SELECTION THE SELECTION PROCESS WEED'S OUT GUYS THAT A'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOSS AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET GET UP AAIN NO YOU'VE GOT SEALS STEALS CAN TAKE A LOSS AND GET BACK UP AGAIN THAT'S WHAT YOU LEARN HOW TO DOIN BIT R THAT'S WHAT YOU YOU'N'T LEARN HOW TO DO YOU YOU HAVE IT ANIF YOU MAKE IT THOUGH THAT TRAINING YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY TO TAKE A LSS ARE I COOL SHAKE IT OFF GET BACK UP KEEP GOING THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT YOU SO NOW YOU'VE GOT GUS THAT ARE TAKING A LOSS NEY DON'T SEE AWAY OUT ANY MORE IN FACT TO SUCH A POINT THAT THEY'E GING TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES IT'S O I MY SUSPICION ISNAT SOME POINT THE'REGING TO FIGURE OUT THAT THAT THIS EXPOSURE TO EXYOU KNOW TO THE ADRENALIN THE EXPLOSE EXPLOSIONS ALL THE TIME AND MEAND YOU GO OUT TO ARRANGE JUST JUST IN IN PEACE TIME YOU GOT TO ARRANGE AND YOU SHOOT TO KARL GOSTOFV AND YOU'RE ARRANGE SAFETY OFFICERS SO YOU GO OUT THERE WITH EVERY GUY THAT SHOOTIN A KARGUSTOFF TO BIG GIANT LIKE BAZOKA LOOKING WEAPON AND EVERY TIME YOU SHOOT IT KIND OF RATTLES YOUR CAGE A LITTLE BIT WOLF YOU'RE A RANGE SAFETY OFFICER AND YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOURE GIN TO WATCH EVERY ONE IN THE PLATUNE SHOOT THREE OF THOSE IT'S CON TO HAVE IMPACT THEN YOU GO RSEAS AND YOU'RE BREECURE OR YOU'RE PART OF A BREECH TEAM I'MIN OT A TIME WHE'RE ONE OF MY GUYS WHEAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING AN ASSAULT ON A COMPOUND I'M ON THE LADDER LIKE MOST BUILDINGS IN A RACK HAVE A WALL AROUND EM SO THE WAY WE WOULD C NDUCK THESE RATES PUT THE LADDER UP YOU THE ASSAULT THE BREACH TEAM WOULD CLIMB OVER THE LADDER AND I WOULD GO RIGHT BEHIND THE BREACH TEAM AND I WOULD STAND ON THE LADDER SO I'M LOOKING AT THE BUILDING OBSERVING MAKING SOR THRES NO ONE WAKING UP MAKES THERE'S NO THREATS AND THEN AS I'M WATCHING THIS GUY IN PARTICULAR HE PUTS THE BREACH ON THE DOOR EXPLOSIVE BREACH SO HE'S GON A BELOW THE DOOR UP HE'S GOT HIS LITTLE TEAM WITH HIM HE HE PUTS THE BREACH ON THE DOOR HE STARTS TO BACK AWAY AND THRE'S LIKE AN OBSTACLE ARE WAS LIKE A FRECAN TABLE OR A LONG CHAIR SOMETHING HE COULDN'T GET AROUND IT HOMS AT IT'S DARK MME IT'S THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT'S TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND I'M LIKE ALL ONE WHR E'S GOIN TO DO A SEEM KIND OF STUCK FOR A SECOND AND I JUST EHIM LAY DOWN AND I'M LIKE OH HE'S HE'S GOING TO TAKE THIS THING AND SURE ENOUGH YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR FEET AWAY FROM THIS BREACH POINT HE LAYS DOWN AND JUST CLACKS OFF THIS EXPLOSIVE CHARGE AND I JUMP OVER WALL AND AS I'M GOING IN I TUNIP YOU DON'T GET THE REST OF PLETUNE TO GOIN COMMENCE US ASSAULT I LOOK AT HIM HE'S Y YOU LOOK LIKE HE JUST GOT YOU KNOW HIDDN'T HAD OF THE BASEBALL BAT IN GUESS WHAT HE DID THE NEXT NIGHT ANOTHER BREACH ON ANOTHER TARGET GUESS WE DO THE NEXT NIGHT ANOTHER BREACH ON ANOTHER TARGET SO YOU GET GUISE THAT HAVE THAT EXPOSURE WHICH IS I MEAN EVERY SEALS EATING A BREACH I MA'T YOU'RE EATIN FLASH BANGS YOU'RE EATING BREACHES YOU'RE SHOOTING FIFTY COWS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE EATIN SOME SOME TROMATIC BRAIN INJURY BUT THEN YOU YOU MUST HAVE SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF GENETIC A PROPENSITY TO HAVE THIS NEGATIVE THING HAPPEN AND AND I I CAN ONLY GUESS MAN THAT THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU KNOW WE WOULDN'T BE HEREIN SO MANY OF THESE STORIES AND ND OF COURSE WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE SEOL THINGS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE MILITARY RIT LARGE WHICH IS IN THE SAME EXACT BOAT I'M ALSO NERVOUS ABOUT THE SOCIAL CONTAGION OF SUICIDE WITHIN THE VETERAN COMMUNITY I I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THAT IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IT MAKES ME APPREHENSIVE ABOUT TALKING ABOUT IT BUT I OBVIOUSLY OUG TALKD ABOUT A HAD PEOPLE ON MY PONCAST TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS UM BUT I I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT SOCIAL CONTAGION OF MAN YOU KNOW FRED DIDN IT YOU KNOW HE GOT ALL THIS ATTENTION AND HE DOES'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANYTHING ANY MORE I'M GOING TO DO IT TOO THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME LEVEL OF THAT GOING ON AS WELL SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A HORRIBLE SITUATION YET THE SOCIAL CONTAGION PIRES ONE THAT HITS HOME FROM A DIFFERENT DIMENSION THE HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO WHICH IS NAME ISNAN IMPORTANT BY GUN HIGH SCHOGU AN N GUN HIGH SCHOOL IS FAMOUS FOR BEING ONE OF THE BETTER PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS NOT THAT I ATTENDED AS MUCH AS I SHOULD OF I TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE CURBS IN THE PARKING LOT THAT I COULD TELL YOU BUT THE CLASSES I TOOK AND THAT'S JUST NOT INCURGING PEOPLE TO NOT ATTEND HIGHSCHOOL PLEASE DO IT TOOK A LOT OF REALLY HARD WORK TO CLIMB BACK UP TO WHERE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN WHEN I GRADUATE BUT E HAS AN INFAMOUS REPRETATE REPUTATION I SAY A REPUTATION AS AN INFAMOUS SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE HIGH SUICIDE RATES I ANY THE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THERE'S A TRAIN TRACKS THAT RUN THROUGH TOWN AND THAT BTHERE WAS A KIND OF A CONTAGIEN OF CUSES THROWN THEMSELVES ON THE TRAIN TRACKS THIS WAS HAPPENING A LOT THIS AS WRITTEN UP IN VERIOUS NEWSPAPERS AT CETERA FORTUNATELY T SEEMS TO HAVE DIE DOWN AGAIN I'M ALSO HESITATA I TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO SPARK THIS BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT LACK OF ABILITY TO SEE INTO A FUTURE OBVIOUSLY OR THE FUTURE THAT PEOPLE EVRE SEEING INTO IS SO DARK THAT SOMEHOW THEY LOSE TOUCH WITH THE IDEA THAT EMOTIONS COME AND GO YOU SEIT IT ABOUT EMOTION ABOUT MOTIVATION HEMOTIONS COMIND GO BUT SOME HOUT PEOPLE LOSE TOUCH WITH THAT AND THEN I I WILL VENTURE A GUESS AND HERE I'M HOPING SOMEONE TO IN A FIGURE THE SOUD AT SOME POINT S WE CAN HAVE A MORE CONCRETE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MECHANISMS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING ABOUT IDENTITY ABOUT UM LOSS OF A PLACE TO PUT ONE'S ENERGY IU SOME SOMETHING USEFUL IN THE WORLD AN OT IF YOU'RE GENERA YOU WOR YOU'RE TALKING BOUT HERE AGUISES THAT THAT ARE GENERATORS RIGHT THEY ARE NOT PROJECTORS THEY'RE GENERATORS THEY THEY LIVE TO HAVE IT AFFECTIVE ACTION ON THE WORLD FOR GOOD AND THEN AND O KILLING THEMSELVES IN YOUTH IT'S A LOTLE MORE COMPLICATED TO PUT PUT A FINGER ON YOU KNOW CAUS WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE WE ASSUME DEPRESSION BUT THEN IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT SUICIDE THERE'S ALSO THIS KIND OF LIKE EXCITEMENT OF FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE ABOUT SOLVING SOMETHING THAT SEEMED UNSOLVABLE ANY OTHER WAY AND AGAIN I'M NOT CERTAINLY NOT ENCOURAGING THIS A STRONGLY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE OBVIOUSLY BUT SOMETHING ABOUT TIME IN THE LOSS OF PERCEPTION ABOUT TIME AND ONE THING THAT WE KNOW FOR SURE HERE WE CAN REALLY HANG OUR HAT ON SOMETHING IS THAT IF YOU DO THE FERENZICS ON SOMEBODY THAT WAS SUICIDEALL ATTEMPTED OR TOOK THEIR LIFE IN THE PRECEDING DAYS AND WEEKS THE'RE SLEEP WAKE SCHEDULE WAS COMPLETELY WACKED THEY THEY EXIT THE NORMAL ROUTINE OF MOST PEOPLE THEY ISOLATE THROUGH INVERSIONS OF TIME AND I DO WONDER SOMETIMES WHETHERE NOT THE VAMPIRESHIFS AS THERE SOMETIMES CALL THE NIGHT TIME EMPLOYMENTS AND THE BACK AND FORTHHEMAND THAT'S A LOT FOR A SYSTEMTY A NA SHIFT WORKERS KILL THEMSELVES FAR MORE THAN ON SHIFT WORKERS I'M SO I DO THINK THERE'S SOMETHING THERE AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING EVERYONE EEDS TO BE IN BED BY NINE AND UP BY FORE AND NO ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD BE A GREAT SCHEDULE FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME UNIVERSAL LAWS OF WHAT MAKES THE HUMAN BODY AND BRAIN HEALTHY AND IF YOU VIOLATE THOSE LAWS LONG ENOUGH WE SEE TO ER WITH DESRUPTION IN YOUR SCHEDULS YOU RUN THE RISK ESPECIAL IF THERE'S A PREDISPOSITION THERE AND THEN OTHER FACTORS START TO LAYER IN AYET I I AND I OUGHT HAVE TO APOLOGIZE CAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY REAL ANSWERS OR MORE BIOLOGY OR PSYCHOLOGY TO FIRMLY THROW OUT THIS EXCEPT THE THE WARNING FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE BYPOLER AND KNOW SOMEBODY WITH BYPOLER THEY ARE TWENTY TO THIRTY TIMES MORE LIKELY TO KILL THEMSELFS AND MAILS AND PARTICULAR MORE LIKELY TO USE I METHODS THAT WILL KILL THEM THE FIRST TIME AS SUPPOSE TO SURVIVE THERE'S A BIG A SEX DIFFERENCE THIR THE THEYOU THROW ALKOHOLL IND THEIR TOO IM YOU KNO A AND MARKES HAS RUN IN ORGANIZATION NOW WHERE THEY'RE TAKING THEY'RE TAKIN FATS DOWN TO DO THE PSYCHODELIC IM WIT A CAL A JOURNEY YOUR TAT THIS IS BETTER IN SELITIONS YET I I THERE A GREAT ORGANIZATION YE AND I SHOULD MEN TO VERY BY PARTIS AN ORGANIZATION I WENT ATTENDEN ONE EVENT AT ON CORNADO AND THEY WERE PEOPLE FROM THE FAR LEFT THE FAR RIGHT POLITICIONS AND EVERYTHNG IN BETWEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW CRITICAL THIS IS THERE'S NOT A POLITICAL ISSUSS A IS A MENTAL HEALTH IS YOU YE AND EVEN WHEN I REFLECTED ON MARKAS TALKING TO ME YOU WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW YE'S KIND OF IN THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL PARDF LHY DOWNWARD SPITAL HE'S DRINKING EVERYDAY AND U'M THINKING MYSELF MAN LIKE I DIDN'T THINK OF IT DURING THE SHOW I KIND WAS THINKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS HOW'S THINKING MAN LIKE YOU DRINK IF YO'R DRINKING ALL THE TIME YOU'RE ON A DOWNWARD SPIRAL LIKE THAT'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD JUST STOP LET'S STOP THAT IMMEDIATELY SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT ALT THAN I I THINK WHEN WE THAT'S ANOTHER SIGN FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN IF SOME ONE'S SELF MEDICATING WITH ALCOHOL IT'S IT' IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE NOT A GOOD PLACE THEY'RE NOT A GOOD PLACE IN THA THEY COULD PROBALY OU SOME HOLP I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING IT AGAIN WE DID THIS EPISODE ON ALCAL I WENT INTO TOTALLY OPEN MINDED I'V NEVER BEEN A BIG DRINKER I'VE HAD I CAN DRINK OR NOT DRINK WAS NEVER REALLY INTO DRUGS UM AT ALL YOU'VE DABLE A LI BIT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER EVER GRAT IT FRANKLY BRAIN IS PLASTIC EARLY ON I DIDN'T NEED THAT NEVER DID HARD DRUGS NEVER TOUCHED COQANE AND FE AMEANOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO IM AND IF I HAD I WOULD SAY RIGHT I AN COMFORTABLE ENOUGH IN MY POSITION LIFE THAT IF I HAD I'D CERTAINLY SAY BUT I THINK THAT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT ALCALLS BAD FOR US A CERTAINLY PASSE A CERTAIN YOUR TO DRINK WEEK LIMIT PEOPLE SPECIALY W THAT PROPENSITY FOR ALCALLISM OR WHO ARE DEALING WITH OTHER ISSUES THAT'S ESPECIALLY THAT CASE FOR NOT DRINKING I AND I GUESS THAT YOU KNOW WE GOT INTO SOME A HARD TERRITORY HERE BUT I I THINK IF THIS CONVERSATION CHUSE UP IN AWARINESS TO ANYBODY WHICH I HOPE IT WOULD IM EITHER PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THAT SPACE OF WONDERING IF THEY SHOULD CONTINUE OR NOT OR THAT KNOW SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE I DO THINK THAT THE TAKEAWAY IS VERY CLEAR WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE WAYS TO AVOID THESE TRAPS AND TO AVOID MAKING THESE TRAPS WORSE AND I THINK WE REGULAR SLY WAKES SCADUALS UNDERSTANDING THAT AND I WROTE THIS DOWN THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE PARTICULAR HAVE SAID SEVERAL TIMES THY RATHER THAN LOOKING FOR SOURCES OF THINGS OUTSIDE YOU LIKE A JOB OR RELATIONSBUT WHICH ARE ALL GREAT UM BUT AS SOURCES OF ENERGY YOUR MOTIVATION OR INSPIRATION TO USE ACTION AS POSITIVE ACTION AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY I THINK IS IT JUST A IF I WOULD IK COUD LIKE PUT THAT UP ON A BILL BOARD IN TIME SQUARE I WOULD RIGHT AND I PUT YOUR NAME NEXT TO IT UM WHICH IS THAT ACTION IS A POSITIVE ACTION IS A SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT THEN YOU CAN RECYCLE INTO MORE THINGS I THINK YE GOING BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTALS I YE AN AND POSITIVE ACTION IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO CONTEND WITH SOMETHING WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF RIGHT STEP INTO IT MOVE TOWARDS IT THAT THAT'S HOW YOU'RE IN TA SOLVE THAT PROM YOU DON'T YOU DON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS BY RUNNING AWAY FROM THEM YOU SOLVE THEM BY MOVING TOWARDS THEM AND FIGURE NOT WHAT'S GOING ON AND AND I ME OW CAULSE OBVIOUSLY A CLEAR WAY TO AVOID THE PROBLEM AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT FOUR HOURS AND YOU WAKE UP IN THAT PROMISE STILL THERE AND THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT GOOD BUT YEN WE'VE GOT U SOME KIND OF A PROBLEM AND LISTEN THEN WE CAUN GET GO DOWN THE WHOLE PATH OF TALKING ABOUT THE INDIRECT APPROACH WHICH IS A THEORY OF COMBAT WHICH I COMPLETELY BELIEVE IN BUT IT ALSO APPLIES TO YOU INTERACTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SOME OTHER PERSON TO THINK MISTER PLAGGOT I DON'T PROM OF T ANDREOM TO GO CONFRONT HIM ON IT AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE BESOLUTION IN FACT IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BESSOLUTION FOR ME TO GO CONFRONT YOU WITH THE PROBICAUS NOW E CAN HAVE A CONFONTATION IT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR ME TO TAKE AN INDIRECT APPROACH AND NOT CONFRONT YOU BUT INSAID ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S MAY BE ADJACENT TO THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE AND THEN EVENTUALLY THAT BUILDS OUR RELATIONSHIP TO A POINT WHERE YOU START TO RECOGNIZE OH I BET JOCKL FEELS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THING AND WE CAN MOVE TOWARDS A SOLUTION INSTEAD OF ME TRYING TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE WITH SOME TRUTH THAT I BELIEVE FIRST THE TRUTH THAT YOU BELIEVE NOW WE'RE ENGAGING COMBAT AND THAT'S BAT THERES CAN TO BE CAFIULETIES I'D RATHER TAKE AN INDIRECT APPROACH AND BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS IN A MORE POSITIVE WAY LOVE THAT AND I LOVE IT BECAUSE REALLY SPEAKS TO THE POWER OF THINKING CAREFULLY AND BEING PATIENT AN A LIL BIT SLOWER AT TIMES I ALSO HEARD YOU SAY SOMETHING EARLIER THAT STILL FLAGGING IN MY MIND WHICH IS YOU KNOW NOT THINKING TOO MUCH THINK SEEMS TO BE A TIME WHERE THINKING TOO MUCH IS VERY DANGEROUS AND AGAIN WE CAN KEEP THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH OR CAN EVEN JUST CALL WHAT IS MENTAL ILLNESS I THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREES SUICIDE IS SOME REFLECTION OF AN UNHEALTHY STATE WE CAN KEEP THAT IN THE BASHOP AS WE TALK ABYU THIS BUT THIS ISN'T NESERELY ONLY ABOUT THAT YOU SEEM TOHAVE AN ABILITY TO YOENGAGE IN THINGS WITHOUT THINKING TOO MUCH AND YET ALSO TO SIT BACK AND BE PRETTY A OBSERVANT AND YOU'VE TALK ABOUT THIRD PERSONING OF THE CELF I'D LOVE TO TALK A LO BIT MORE ABOUT THIS EVEN THOGH IT'S A TOPIC YOU DELVE IN TO BEFORE AND IN PARTICULAR THE TOPIC OF MEDITATION I'VE BEEN READING MORE ABOUT MEDITATION I'VE MEDITATED FOR DIFFERENT STRETCHES MY LIFE DIFFERENT MOUNTS OF TIME AND THEY'RE TOO BASIC FORMS OF MEDITATION THAT I ONLY RECENTLY LEARNED ABOUT ONE IS A FOCUSE ATTENTION MEDITATION YOUR SITTING CLOSINGYOU EYES FOCSING ON YOUR BREATH BODY BODY SURFACE OR EVEN A VISUAL TARGET IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND JUST FOCUS AND WE KNOW THAT THAT ENHANCES ONE'S ABILITY TO FOCUS YOU DO TOO LATE IN THE DAY IT ALSO ENHANCE YOUR ABILITY TO NOT FALL ASLEEP I WIT LOP YOU'L DON'T REALIZE THE MEDITATION TOO LATE IN THE DAY IF IT'S A FOCUSED MEDITATION YOU'RE JUST RAMPING UP THE ACTIVITY IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IT'S A GRE TOOL FOR AN GETTING BETTER IT FOCUSING BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THIS TYPE OF MEDITATION CALLED OPEN OBSERVER MEDITATION WERE YOU PURPOSELY DON'T INCLUDE A TARGET IN YOUR MIND OR IN YOUR VISION OR IN YOUR HEARING AND YOU JUST SIT THERE EYES CLOSED YOUR EYES OPEN AND YOU GO INTO A PLACE OF WHATEVER COMES UP WHBUT YOU DON'T HOVER THERE TOO LONG THE GOAL IS TO NOT HOVER ON ANY ONE THING WHICH SOUNDS LIKE DELIBERATE ATTENTION DEFAS IT DISORDER BUT IT'S AT SHY A PRETTY COOL METHOD IT TURNS OUT FOR RESTORING OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN FOCUS BUT ALSO FOR ONE PARTICULAR THING THAT YOU MENTIONED OURLIER WHICHES CREATIVITY IN CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING WHICH OF COURSE REQUIRES ACCESSING WAS YOU SAY MORE COLORS ON THE PALATE THAN YOUR VISION MIGHT BE ON REALIZING OTHERS ALSOALL THESE OTHER COLORS OVER HERE IN THE PARIFERY THAT I'M MISSING TO THE HIPER FOCUS DO YOU MEDITATE IF YOU DO MEDITATE IS IT MORE OF AN OPEN MONITERING OR A FOCUSED MEDITATION AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT KIND OF STANDARD MEDITATION ARE THERE TIMES THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY AND YOUR ROUTINE AND YOUR WEEK WHERE AS I'M DESCRIBING IN THIS IT MAPS TO SOMETHING THAT CON OF FEELS LIKE OPEN MONITERING OR FOCUSED MEDITATION YES OR NO I DON'T MEDITATE I HAVEN EVER I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER ACTUALLY MEDITATED FOR ONE SECOND IN MY LIFE AND I AND I REFUSE TO E IF NOT THAT AT ALL I DO I SAM HARRIS SENT ME IS AP AND HE AND WE'RE GOING TO UPON CAST IS I'V DO I'LL DO IT FOR TWO WEEKS AND WI'LL DO UPON CASTAN AND I'LL BE MORE ENLIGHTENED IND EVERYTHING AND I DIDNT EVEN GIVE SA HRRIS TO WEEKS YOU NO SO I STILL OH SAM HARRIS TWO WEEKS ON HIS AP OF MEDITATION SO WE CAN SEE HOW IT IMPACTS ME BUT NO I I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE I'VE NEVER TRIED TO DO IT AND THAT BEING SAID IF THE GOAL IS TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND DETACH FROM WHAT'S GOING ON I DO THAT ALL DAY EVERY DAY SO THEO THAT'S THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT SOMETHING I TRIED TO TEACH YOU I TRIED TO TEACH THE YOUNG SEAL LEADERS NOT TO GET CAUGHT UP AND WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THAT BUT TO TAKE A STEP BACK DETACHD FROM THE SITUATION DETACHED FROM THEIR EMOTIONS SEE MORE OF WHAT'S HAPPE YOU YOU YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEEING MORE COLORS OF THE PALATE WELL ON THE BATTLE FIELD I WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE MORE ANKLES MORE MANEUVERS MORE OPPORTUNITIES MORE OF WHAT THE ENEMY MIGHT DO MORE PERSPECTIVE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS TRIED TO ACHIEVE AND SO I I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY GOOD DISCUSSION ON MEDITATION CAUSE I HAVEN'T HAVEN'T TRIED IT NO APOLOGY NECESSARY BUT I WILL ASK WHEN YOU GO SURFING YOU'RE SITTING IN THE WATER WAITING FOR A WAVE ARE YOU FOCUST ON ONE PARTICULAR CATION ON THE HORIZON OR YOU CUT OF INCUNE OF I A OPEN MONERING JUST ENJOYING JUST BOUNCING UP AND DOWN IN THE WATER LIKE WHERE IS YOUR ATTENTION JURING ACTIVITIES LIKE THAT YE SO SURFING OFTENTIMES SURFING YOU YOU YOU YOUR MONKEY MIND THAN YOURE JOST NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING SAMETHING WITH YOU DID TO ALSO WITH SURFING YUNIN FOR WAITING FOR A WA 'VE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOUR MIND IS JUST GOING I MEAN IT'S IT'S IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE SOMETIMES AS YOU'RE SITTING THERE WAITING CAUSE YOU'RE JUST LOOKING OUT AT THE HORIZON AND YOUR YOU'R MIND  ME MY MIND I'M THINK AT BOM ALL KINDS I I I'VE TO COME I'VE TO COME HOME SOMETIMES IN MIKE WRITE NOTES BECAUSE I THOUGHT OF THIS I THOUGHT OF AN IDEA IV THOUHT OF A PRORSPECTIVE THAT HAPPENS TO BE A TRUDICT THROUGH THAT HAPPENS TO BE S TALKING TO PEOPLE WERE I SOME ONE'S TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING OF MIKE IGGN  AN IDEA WRIT I RRET THAT DOWN HAVE TO GO AND WRITE IT DOWN I'VE I HAVE NOTES IN MY PHONE YOU KNOW LIKE PAGES IN PAGES AND PAGES OF NOTES IN MY PHONE OF IDEAS THAT I HAD AND I RIGHTE HIM NOW YOU VOICE MEMO THINGS OO I TYPEEM I II ONLY NEED T A TYPE LIKE SEVEN WORDS ON ON AND THEN I HAVE THE WHOLE IDEAS IN MY HAD SO II PUT A LOT INTO THE NOTES IN MY PHONE AS WELL AND IT E PRODY LOOKS LIKE GIBBERISH TO A LOV HE WUTD I I GO BACK THROUGHIM WHEN HIM ON THE PLAIN SPECIALLY PROBLEMS I WAS CHALLENGED WITH TEN YEARS AGO OR SOMETHING N I LOOK I OWN I'MSTEAL WITH THE SAME THING DIFFERENCE AN SAME SAME ME RIGHT YOU THERE'S THAT WE HAD A A AMAZING PSYCHIATRIST ON THE SHO I BUT I'D LOVED IT TO HEAR A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWOU THE TWO OF YOU HIS NAME IS A PAULCONTIS TRAINED OT STAMFORD AND HARVOR'S A MAZING I UM I SHAL TALKS OPENLY ABOUT THE THE TRAGY THAT HIS BROTHER KILLED HIMSELF WHICH WAS WHAT DROVE HIM INTO PSYCHIATRY AND UH HE'S INTERESTING UI BECAUSE HE'S OBVIOUSY HIGHLY EDUCATED INCREDIBLY SMART YOU WROTE A BOOK ON TRAMA BUT HE HAS INCREDIBLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS OF PSYCHOLOGY INCLUDING NARCISISM SOCIO PATHHE HE'S WORKS IN A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING DOMAINS WITH INTERESTING PEOPLE THAT EVERYONE LISTING ON IS PACAS WOULD RECOGNIZE OF COURSE HE'S NOT IN REVEAL WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE BUT UM AND YOU KNOW HE TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN LOOK AT DIFFERENT PEOPLE BIT HE WAS ICTALY THE ONE THAT SHARED WITH ME THIS NOTION OF GENERATORS AND AND I'M PROJECTORS AND DIRECTI ME TOWARDS THAT LITERATURE BUT WHEN HE HIM ON THE POCASY YOU KNO HE TALKED A LO BIT ABOUT THAT'S TUT WHAT HE TALKE MOSTLY ABOUT TRAMA BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE'RE TLING ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THE WORLD AND DIFFERENT ARCHETYPES AND HOW YOU START LOOKING AT STORIES THROUGHOUT HISTORYAND YOU TRUSCING THE SAME THEMES OVER AND OVER RIGHT I'M WESTERNS YOU KNOW THIS IDEA A GUI RISE IN TO TOWN AND DOES SOME REPAIR WORK LIKE DEFEATS THE SINISTER PERSON OR THINGS THAT ARE IMPOSING ON THE TIN THAT RIDES TO THE NEXT TOWN IT'S ALWAYS LIKE AN ENDS WITH THA IT'S A GOING TO KEEP CONTINUING IN THE BUT THEN WE GOT TO THIS DISCUSSION OF RELATIONSHIP HE TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW HE SAID THIS ON THE PODCASTS OF A PATIENT WHO YOU KNOW SAID YOU KNOW I'VE UM I BEEN IN TEN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND HE'D SAY TO THAT PATIENT KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN ONE RELATIONSHIP TEN TIMES RIGHT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY IT'S ALL ABOUT YOURISH YOU RIGHT THAT'S I'M NOT YOU I'M NOT PERVOSELY DIDN'T POINT AT YOU FOR THOSE LISTENING UM AND I THINK THAT THOSE FEATURES OF OURSELVES THAT WE BRING FROM CONDITION O CONDITION CAN BE NEGATIVE OR THAT CAN BE PAUSE IVE ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING AND I HERE I'M NOT TRYING TO SOLVE A OR UNDERSTAND THE SEALTEAM COMMUNITY PER SAY BUT I THINK THEY REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT ARCHETYPE BECAUSE THEY ARE SELECTED FOR THIS ABILITY TO TAKE A HARD CONDITIONS AND A FAILURES AND TURN THEM INTO WINDS THAT'S ONE OF THE SELECTION CRIED TERIA SEEMS SEEMS TO BE THEY'RE FINDING WHO HAS THAT CAPABILITY I SEE A LOT OF AND HAPPEN TO KNOW IF YOU PEOPLE FROM THE SEAL TEAMS TO GET OUT AND DO REALLY WELL MELLY GREAT BUSINESS IS YOURE SHINING EXAMPLE THIS AND THEY HAVE A FAMILY AND YOU A GOT GERMAN SHEPERD TO YE WE'LL TALK ABOUT ANIMALS AND LOBT A DOG IS LIKE YOU SERVE AND YOU TRAIN AND LIKE I'M SURE YOU HAVE YOUR DARK PLACES DARK MOMENTS AND CHALLENGES LIKE ANYBODY ELSE BUT THINGS LOOK TO ME LIKE THE'R GOING PRETTY WELL AND THEN I ALSO KNOW PEOPLE IN THE SE FROM THE SEAL TEAMS OKET THEY DON'T GO DOWN THE PATH OF SUICIDE FORTUNATELY BUT IT SORT LIKE THEY DON'T DO AS WELL AS I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT PICKING ON THIS COMMUNITY I ALSO SEE THIS FROM PEOPLE WERE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES I KNOW KITS IT WE'RE PHENOMINAL IN HIGH SCHOOL I ME THESE WERE LIKE EARLY ADMISSION ALL THE IVILE SCHOOLS CAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HAPPEN IN THE TOWN THAT I GREW UP IN AND I LOOK AT THEM NOWN ON LIKE WHOW LIKE IH IT DIDN'T SOMEHOW IT'S NOT WORKING OUT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTNT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR THAT THAT YOU KNOW YES WINNING CREATES THE PROPENSITY FOR MORE WINNING TTHEN WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT IN A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRAINED TO SOLVE PROMS ADAPT AND MAKE THINGS WORK SOME PEOPLE FLOURISH OUTSIDE THE MILITARY AND SOME FLOURISH LASS AND SOME WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT REALLY YOU KNOW GO DOWN THAT THE DARK TRAPS WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S THE QUALITY THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE REALLY ADAPTABLE IN PARTICULAR CAUSE MOST OF US LIVE IN A LANDSCAPE WHERE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT US LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT GOOD IT WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT AND SOMETIMES THAT'S AN OUSET SOMETIMES IT'S NOT YOU SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY GOOD IT LIKE UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN ANIMAL AND WORKING WITH THAT SO AGAIN THIS IS A BROAD QUESTION WE'RE GOING VERY BROAD BAND HERE AN WE'LL GET NARROWER AND AGAIN IN IA BIT BUT ID LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON LIKE WHY IS IT HOW IS IT WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY THRIVES IN NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS I HAVE TO START OFF UT JUST BY SAYING  I WROTE A NOW AS YOU ARE TALKING I JUST PUT SEAL AND THEN I PUT THE NOT EQUALS SIGN YOU KNOW LIKE CAUSE YOU CAN'T SAY THAT A SEAL EQUALS ANYTHING BY EXCELLENT POINT IT IS I MEAN THERE'S GUISE THERE'S GUIES THEAT HAVE BEEN N THE SEAL THIMES THAT ARE ARE MURDERERS LIKE THERE'S LIKE REAL LIKE MURDER LIKE MURDERS I RAPIS AND MURDERERS THAT WENT THROUGH SEAL TRAINING RAPOUS MURDERS AND THEIR IMPRISON FOR RESTER LIVES LIKE THAT THAT'S OF THING THERE'S PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEN I THE SEAL TEAMS THAT  YOU KNOW IVE GOT KICK OUT OF SEAL TEAMS FOR DRUGS AND I MEAN YOU YOU NAME IT AND WE'VE GOT THAND WE'VE GOT GOT THAT ARE JUST LAZY IF WE GOT GUISE THAT IT JUST NPHYSICIANS YOU COULD SAY THIS ABOUT PHYSICIANS THE'RE BEEN SOCIOPATHIC AM YOU KNOW I SERIAL KILLER PHYSICIANS AND THEN THEY'RE ONES THAT ARE IN THERWRL COUNTRIES RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD WOULD NOT ACCEPT AT A BILLION DOLLARS TO STOP SERVING PEOPLE AT THE LEVEL OF THE BASIC MEDICINE THAT  THEY DESERVE SO THERE'S THE FY OTHERS THERE'S THE SEALS THAT GET OUT AND JUST VOLUNTEER TO GO HELP IN THE WORST PLACES IN THE WORLD SO YO'VE GOT A FULL SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE SO TO SAY A SEAL EQUALS SUCCESS AIN' ANY DOMAIN THE ONLY DO MAIN YOU CAN SAY THAT THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL AS THEY MAKE IT THROUGH BASIC EL TURNCAUSE GUYSE MAKE IT THOUGH BASIC SEU'L TAIN AN THE'RE NOT GOOD SEALS THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW SO YOU GET GUYS THAT MAKE IT THROUGH BASIC SEAL TRAINING AND THEY MAKE IT THROUGH SEAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING AND TMHEY MAKE IT TO A SEALTAM AND BAY GET KICKE OUT OF THE SELTINGS CAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOOD SEALS THEY WAN'T MEANT TO DO THAT JOB THAT HAPPENS SO ALL THEY'VE PROVIN BY MAKINGIT THROUGH BASIC HEAL TRAINING AS THEY CAN KIND OF SOCK IT UP FOR A WHILE AND THERE'S ALSO GUISE THAT MAKE IT THROUGH BASIC SEAL TRAINING CAUSE THEY LEARNED HOW TO MANEUVER THROUGH THE SYSTEM THEY LEARN WHAT TO DO IN WHAT THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS WEARN HOW THEY COULD SCAPE THOUGHTHIS THERE'S GUISE LIKE THAT IT'S IT'S NOT A HUGE NUMBER BUT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY THERE WE SEE THEM IN SCIENCE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT GO TO A LAB FIGURE OUT WHO THE DIRECTOR OF THE LAB IS AT THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND THIS IS ASHAL ON OF THE MORE DANGEROUS ASPECTS OF SCIENCE IT ASHALY NEGATIVELY IMPACKS ALL OF SOCIETY I'LL JUST SAY IT AND TANY SCIENTISTWILL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THEY FIND THE BIG FAMOUS LABS THEY FIGURE OUT WHO THAT LEADER OF TE LAB IS AND THEY GET THAT PERSON THE DATA THEY WANT THEY MIGHT NOT MAKE THE DATA UP BUT THEY WILL CERTAINLY DISCARD THE DATA THAT DON'T FIT BY THAT WHICH IS ONE WAY OF MAKING DATA UP BY EXCLUSION RIGHT IT'S NOT LITERALY LIKE PAINTING PICTURES OF CELLS THAT AREN'T THEIR SOMETHING BUT THAT APPENS A LOT AND THOSE PEOPLE OFTEN GO FAR THEY RARELY GO ALL THE WAY BECAUSE PRETTY SOON THEYR REPUTATION YOU KNOW EXPANS TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE GO LIKE YE I KNOWONE CAN REPEAT THAT RS ALL LIKE THAT BUT THESE PEOPLE SIT IN VERY HIGH POSITIONS NOT AT STAMFORD RIGHT I WILL SAY I DON'T KNONW ANY ON MY COLLEGUES AT STAMFORD T  THAT MEET THAT O THOSE CRITERIA BUT YOU SEE THEM AND YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY'R BASELY SOLVING A SOCIAL ENGINEERING THING THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE DOING IT IN SCIENCE NOW WHY ANYONE WOULD DO THAT IN SCIENCE I DON'T KNOW THESE YOU DON'T GET RICH IN SCIENCE HE CERTAINLY THEY GET FAMOUS BUT FOR WHATEVER ISON THEY FIGURED IT OUT THAT'S WHERE THEY'REGING TO DO IT ANI'M SURSY AND LAW FIRMS I'MSURE YOU SEE IN EVERY SINGLE THEM MAY HE R NOW YOU POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT TO THE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS TEY GRADUATE FROM IVY LEAGU SCHOMEN THEY DON'T DO WELL AND TO ME THAT'S H VERY SIMILAR TO SOME ONE THAT MIGHT MAKE IT O THE SEAL TEAMS DO WELL TE SEAL TEAMS AND THEN THEY GET OUT THEY DON'T DO WELL IT'S PROBABLY CAUSE WHAT I TALK ABOUT EARLIER WHENE WHEN I WANT TO NAVY BOOL CAMP HERE'S WHAT YOURE GOT TO DO IF YOU DO IT WELL YOU'LL BE REWARDED WELL IF YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL IN YOUR DAD YOUR MOMMINDAD SAY HEY YIF YU DO GOOD IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE GNG TO GET INTO THIS IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL AN YOU GET IN ATOUT IVY LEAGE SCH  HERE'SWHA YOU NEED TO DO IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU TO GET GOOD GRADES YOUD TO BE PART OF THE GLEEU CLUB YOU NEED IT WHATEVER THE THINGS ARE THAT YOU GOT O DO YOU GOT A SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OU GOT A O VOLUNTEER IN IN GUATA MOL IN THE SUMMER TIME YU GOT TO DO THESE THINGS THN YOU'LL GET INTO THE GOOD CAUSE WHENT YOU GET THE GOOD COLLEGE YOU GOT TO GET THIS DEGREE WENTEYOU GT THAT TO GREE SO THE THETHEY'VE HAD A PATH LAID OUT FOR THEM OF BOXES TO CHECK AND THEY GO IN CHECK THE BOXES TAND WHEN THEY GET DONE NO ONE HAS PUT ANY MORE BOXES OUT IN FRONT OF US THEY DON'T NOW WHAT TO DO AND THEND THAT CAN CERTAINLY HAPPEN FROM IN THE FROM SOME ONE IN THE SEAL THEAMES ORE SOMEONE IN THE MILITARY THAT WHAT THEYE BEEN HATE THIS IS YOUR MISSION THIS WHAT YOU GOT TO DO HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO DO WELL CHECK TE BOX CHECK THE BOX CHECK THE BOX CHECK TE BOX IN HIS TIME TO RETIRE AND THERE'S NO ONE PUTN A BOX IN FRONT O TO CHECK AND SO UNLESS SOME ONE IN O SOME GUISE GET OUT OF THE SEAL TEAMS ND THEY GO IN TO A BIG CORPORID STRUCTION THEY KICK ASS BECAUSETHE'RE SOME ON IN THE CORPORAT CORPORAT WORLD SAYING HEH HERE WHICH GOT TO DO NEXT AND THEY DO GREAT AND THAT'S SUPER GOOD FOR THEM AND THE ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE IT I'V TALK TO GUY THE OTHER DAY YOU'S LIKE A FOL ON IN A CORPORATION ES DOING A REAT JOB KEE HE LIKES WHAT HE'S DOING IT'S OSSUM SO BUT I THINK YOU GET SOME GUISE THAT THAT THEY THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE THE OPEN MIND TO SEE WHERE OPPORTUNITIES ARE AND THEYD YOUKNO ONE THING AS NICE ABOUT THE SEL TEAMS IS IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF YOU GET A LOT A FREEDOM O MANEUVERE RIGHT YOU CAN REALLY DO A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU KIND OF WANT TO DO AND SO WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE CORPORAT WORLD THEY DON'T SEE THAT THEY THINK A I NO I'M NOCKIN TO DO THAT BUT THEN HEY'RE NOT QUITE SURE O HOW TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP SO I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU MIGHT SEE SOME GUISE THAT AREN'T SUPERSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A MIND THAT'S OPEN TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES AND AND ALSO YOU GOT SOME GUISE THAT SUCCESS FOR THEM AS THE'RE CAN O HANG OUT WITH THER FAMILY AND THE'R GIN A YOU KNOW GETTING GOOD SHAPE AND THE'RE GONGTOE RUN SOME TRY OFF LANS OR COMPETIN CRO WHATEVER THEYR GOING TO DO THE'RE GON TOE GO DO IT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RELOOKING TO DO YOU OH WHICH IS WHICH IS ALSO OTUM GO TAKE TIME GO IN JOY YOUR FAMILY MAN YOU GAVE ENOUGH TO YOUR COUNTRY GO GO HANG OUT YOUR KIDS THAT'S SUCCESS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED TO I AGREE THERE I KNOW FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL LIVES BUT WHO HAVE VERY DIMINISHED PERSONAL LIVES AND IT IS NOT A PRETTY PICTURE YOU KNOW THEY YOU MENTION THE UM THE PARENT KIN O DRIVING THE KID DO THIS DO THAT IN THAT SENARIO I ISENSE TONES OF FEAR IT'S ALL ABOUT NOT BEING A FAILURE IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT LOVE OF YOUR CRAFT OR WHAT YOU ENJOY PRETTY EARLY MY SCIENCE CREER I I LEARNED THAT THE'RE SERTAINPEOPLE ARE JUST AMDISIOUS THEY'S LIKE TO WIN AND AY'S TO JOKE AROUND IT'S NOT POLITE BUT ISEEO YOU KNIGT WE SHOULD ALL JUST TELL THAT PERSON THAT LIKE I NEW COOL THING IS LIKE TRYIN UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGY OF LIKE AND I WO'LD SAY LIKE FEESEES OR SOMETHING AND THEY'D PROLLY WORK ON IT THEY'VE LIKE YEDS LIKE THE GRAYST THIN CAUSE THEY ASH YEY DON'T CARE WHAT THE'RE WORKING ON FOR THEM ITS JUST THE HUNT AND I LEARNE THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE LIKE THAT CAN SERVE AN IMPORTANT ROLL BECAUSE LIKE WEL THERE'S ASHY HOLE MICER BYM THEY'RE ASHLY LAVES OT DO WORK ON FEASES SO FORGIVE ME MY MICER COLLEGUSTHAT WORK O MICR BAMS BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST AMBITIOUS CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE YOU PUT A PROM IN FRONT OF THEM IT'S LIKE A DOG THOUGH JUST RETRIEVE IT'S LIKE O U GO AS OPPOSE TO LOVE OF RETRIEVING A FOR RETRIEVING SAKE ITS I YOU GIVE YOU GIVE IT THAT SAME DOG THE ANALTY HERE YOU GIVE THAT SAME DOG A HIH JUMP IN THA LIKE IN TO HIGH JUMPING RIT NOR WHATEVER IT IS OR DIV IN UNDER WATER BUT I THINK OF PEOPLE MORE LIKE ANIMALS AND MORE LIKE DIFFERENT DOG SPECIES LIKE WE AS YOUR CASE WAS WITH MUSIC PARTICULAR MUSIC AND COMMUNITIES OR EXAMPLE OF CHOPPING FOR THE PANTS AND THAT SPERINCE IT LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU TAPIN TO SOMETHING IT REALLY FEELS KIND OF UNIQUE TO YOU  LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING HERE TO BE ABLE TO FIND WORK THAT INCLUDES THAT BUT ALSO IS HARD AND ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO EVOLVE OVER TIME I MAN I THINK THAT'S HAT'S THE REAL THAT'S THE REAL GIFT THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE SEEKING AND OF COURSE THERE'S KNO SHORT CUT TO THAT EXCEPT PERHAPS ONE WHICH IS TO BE ABLE TO SENSE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMBITION AND THERE'S NO BETTER WORD FOR I LES JUST CALL WHAT IT IS WHICH IS LOVE LIKE I I LOVE THIS AND THE REASON I THINK THAT LOVE IS SO POWERFUL AND HEARE I'M SOUNDING LIKE LIKES FREEDMEAN BUT I DON'T MEAN INTERRELATIONAL LOVE I I REAN LIKE TORE OF THE BEING ABLE TO SENSE WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE IS THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TAP IN TO AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF THINGS THAT FEAR ALONE AN AMBITION ALONE AND JUST BEING HARD DRIVING PERSON ALONE WILL NOT ALLOW US TO TAP IN TO THINGS LIKE ADAPTIVENESS CREATIVITY AND THERE'S AND I THINK THERE'S A REALLY OBVIOUS REASON FOR IT WHICH IS THAT THE ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT OUR SPECIES IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE MORE OF OURSELVES HAN TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR YOUNG WHETHER NOT EVERY ONE HAS KIDS ARE NOT IS IRRELEVANT THE POINT IS THAT EVERY SPECIES NOT ONLY WANTS TO DO THAT BUT MEAN TO DO THAT AND THE FEELING OF LOVE IS REALLY WHAT ALLOWS US TO BE ADAPTABLE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT TRAINS UP ADAPTABILITY AS MUCH AS BEING AROUND KIDS YOU JUST HAVE TO BE ADAPTABLE RIGHT CAUSE THERE ONE MOMENT THER UP THAN THEY'RE DOWN THAN THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED SO YOU KNW YOU AND YOU SHARED REALLY IMPORTANT STORY ABOUT LOSS OF SOMEBODY THAT CLEARLY YOU LOVED AND THAT CLEARLY LOVED THE COMMUNITY HE WORKED IT WASN'T JUST THAT YOU GOS LOVED HIM ITS THAT HE GOT HE LOVED YOUGIZE AND I THINK THAT BEING ABLE TO TAP IN TO THESE FEELINGS OF LOVE FOR THINGS FOR PEOPLE AND FOR EXPERIENCES I THINK IS SO CRITICAL AND YOU KNOW I DON'T MEDITATE MUCH THESE DAYS BUT I HAVE HEARD OF THIS LIKE LOVE IN KINDNESS MEDITATION AND I WAS SOUND SO SOFT TO ME I IS THINKING LIKE GOSH WHAT IM MIS MUST DO THEN FLOAT LIKE LEVITATE AT THE END AND LIKE WEARE OF YOU KNOW MORE WHATEVER IT'S CAI'M NOW WHAT'S THE THING BUT I MY FRIEND AM WHO'M FORTUNATE TO CALL A FRIEND NOT TRYING TO NAMEDROP YOUR MOWN VERY FORTUNE CALL RICK RUBE IN THE MUSIC PRODUCER A FRIEND AND HE WAS THE ONE WHO START TURNING ME ON TO DIFFERENT FORMS OF MEDITATION ONCE I MENTION BEFORE IN THIS IDEA THAT THERE ARE FORMS OF MEDITATION WHICH PUT US IN TOUCH WITH WHAT HE CALLS THE SOURCE NOW THIS IS REALLY GETTING A LO MISTICAL BUT I THINK THIS ALL MAPS BAK TO THE SAME THING WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE SOURCES OF DOTA MEAN AND THE OTHER NARROW TRANSMITTERS IN US THAT GIVE US KIND OF A SUPERPOWER TO ADAPT TO ANYTHING AND I THINK IT'S AT LEAST INCLUDES LOVE BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST ADAPTABLE EMOTION BY DEFINITION BECAUSE OF WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR REVOLUTION SO THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS IN YOURSELF AND IN YOUR OBSERVATION OF PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE WORKED WITH DID YOU EVER SENSE THAT JUST BEING HARD DRIVING WAS KIND OF IT WAS GREAT BUT IT WAS LIMITING LIKE DID YU EVER SENSE THAT LIKE BY LIKING THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH YOU COULD PERFORM MUCH BETTER UM EVEN IF THEY PERHAPS WE'RE NOT AS HARD TO KIND OF BARRO THE THE COMMON PARREL ANSWE AROUND THIS THEY WEREN'T AS HARD AS EVERYBODY ELSE THAT BECAUSE YOU LIKE EACH OTHER SO SO MUCH THAT YOU CAN KIND O DO ANYTHING WELL IF YOU HAVE A TEAM OF TEN PEOPLE AND YOU ALL HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP AND YOU GET ALONG WELL AND YOU'RE GOING AGAINST MY TEAM AND WE ALL HATE EACH OTHER AND WHERE OSAN WENT THE TEAM THAT LOVES EACH OTHER IS GOINGTO WIN I WAS HOP IS IT'S NOT IN CLOSE IT'S NOT A MATT OF FACT IF YOU WORK FOR ME AND YOU DON'T LIKE ME WHAT WHATL KIND OF PERFORMANCE ARE YOUONG TO GIVE ME IT'S GIN TO BE TOUGH WHAT IF YOU LOVE ME AND I'VE LOOKED OUT FOR YOU AND I'VE DONE EVERYTHING FOR YOU AND I'VE TAKEN CARE OF YOU WHAT CON O PERFORMANCE OR YOUNGIV ME OF EVERYTHING OG I DIE FOR YOU SO YET YOU KNOW EARLIER YOU YOU ASKE ABOUT UM THE HUMAN ANIMAL AND HUMAN NATURE AND THIS IS PART OF LEADERSHIP I O ASK THIS QUESTION OVE DAY BY A AS WORKINGWITH A COMPANY AND THE GUY SAYS YOU KNOW HOW DO I IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SOME ONE THAT CAN EXECUTE AND HOW DO I IDENTIFY THOSE CHARACTERISTICS IN A PERSON SO THAT I CAN GET THOSE PEOPLE AN I SAID WELL FIRST OF ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS ARE F THE CHARACTERSTIC THAT EVERYBODY'S IN YOUR OBVIOUSLY SOME ONE THAT'S DRIVEN SOME THAT COMMUNICATE WELL SO AS CAN MAKE THINGS HAPPEN THESS IT THOS A PRETTY SIMPLEITO KNOW WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE HOW DO IDENTIFY IM IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE AS WELL I GIVE YOU A TASK I GIVE ANDREW TASK T'S PRETTY SIMPLE TASK IF YOU GET IT DONE COOL GIVE YOU L A BIT MORE COMPLEX TASK DO YOU GET IT DONE YESK I GIVE GIVE THE SAME TASK TO FRED HE DOESN'T GET IT DONE HE COMES BACK WITH H WUNCH OF QUESTIONS HE SLOW ROLLS IF YOU'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF EXCUSES IN PROMISE I GIVE YOU AN EVEN MORE COMPLEX TASK YOU COME BACK YOU GET IT DONE AND THEN I'M EIN A REALIZE OKE ANDREW'S A GUY AT THAT MAKES THINGS HAPPEN HE'S A GUY THAT CAN ACTUALLY EXECUTE ANY LITTLE BIT WHAT YOU SAID IN MIN THERE CERTAIN BREEDS OF DOGS BUT EVEN THAT IS IT TID THEM NOT AS AS AS DIFFERENT AS HUMAN BEINGS ARE RIGHT LIKE THERE AND THERE ARE SOME SO SO NOW THERE ARE SOME GUYES I'VE GOT ANDREW WHO WILL MAKE THINGS HAPPEN HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH ANDREW WHEN I SAY HEY ANDREW HERE'S THIS NEBULESS IDEA THAT I HAVE CAN YOU TURN THIS INTO A REALITY AND YOU'RE LIKE ITWERE TO START I'M NOT SURE WE YE WANT ME TO GO MEANWHILE I GAVE IT TO THE GUY THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANYTHING HAPPEN WITH SPECIFIC TASKIT I GAVE HIM AND HE COMES BACKAS AS  YOU MIT SAY HY I GOT THIS NEBULOUS IDEA CAN YOU SU YOU HEAS O YA AND ALL THE SUDDEN HE TAKES IT HE SAYS HAF FIGURED OT A WAY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME ONE THAT'S VERY GOOD AT EXECUTING BU THEY'RE NOT VERY CREATIVE I'M MIHT HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S VERY CREATIVE BUT THE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT EXECUTING SO WHAT' I DO I BUILD THE TEAM WHERE I'VE GOT AND YOUAND FRED AND THEY WORK TOGETHER AND FRED COMES UP WITH GOOD IDEAS AND WE BRING HIM TO ANDREW AND ANDRIGLES AND EXECUTES HIM SO THAT'S WHAT WERE DOING FROM A LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVE IS WEREH LETTING PEOPLE'S NATURE EXECUTE AND PURPL WERE PUTTING PEOPLE IN TO ROLLS WHERE' THEI'R NATURE IS BENEFICIAL I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE SOME ONE THAT'S SHY AND INTRAVERTED AN PUT HIM OUT IN A LEAD SAILS ROLL I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE SOMEBODY THAT'S BOISTEROUS AND EXTRAVERTED AND PUT THEM INTO A CUPICLE WHERE THEREGING TO BE LOOKING IN SPREADSHEETS ALL DAY CLEARLY I'M NOT GOINGTO DO THAT SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AS LEADERS IS WE HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE RIGHT ROLL AND WE PLACE THEM INTO THOSE ROLLS NOW DOES IT MEAN THAT I ABANDON ALL HOPE THAT THE GUY THAT'S AN INTRVER WILL EVER DEVELOP MORE COMMUNICATIONS GILLS NOW M SO CAN WORK WITH HIM AND OVER TIME WE'LL GET HIM A LITTLE BIT MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE SOMEBODY THAT'S A A TOTAL INTROVER AND TURN THEM INTO A LEAD SAILS GOD THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANY MORE THAN ON A CHANGE TIGER STRIPES SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE AS LEADER'S GOTE TO HELP PEOPLE FIND THE ROLL AND FIND THE THING THAT THEY'RE GOOD AT NOW DOES THAT MEAN IF I HAVE SOME ONE THAT LOVES THEIR JOB THEY'RE GOING TO DO BETTER AT IT ABSOLUTELY DOES IT MEAN THAT IF I HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S DRIVIN JUST BY ACHIEVEMENT THAT THE'RE GONGTO BE GOOD AT THEI'R JOB NO IN FACT BUT TH THEY CAN BE THERE'S GIN BE CERTAIN ROLLS I CAN PUT HIM IN RIGHT IF I'VE GOT SALES NOTER I NEEN TO HIT AND AND ANDREW SUPER INDA ACHIEVEMENT HE WHAT HE WANTS TO BE THE GOLDEN CHILD THO WANTS TO HAVE HIS PICTURE ON THE ON THE YOU KNOW MAGAZIAN THAT WE PUT OUT ABOUT OUR INDUSTRY COOL I CAN THROW THIS TASK AT YOU AND YET YOU'RE GOING TO GO AND GET IT THE PROBLEM IS IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S GING TO TAKE MORE PERSEVERANCE AND THE REWARD ISN'T THAT HIGH OR IT'S A LONG TERM GOAL YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT EYE FOR THE JOB SO LIKING YOU'RE JOB IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND IF YOU LOVE YOU'R JOB YOU GINGTO BE ABLE TO YOU CAN TO BE ABLE TO MOST LIKELY EXCELL AT IT NOW YOU COULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE PERSON THAT LOVES YOU'R JOB IS NOT GOOD AT IT THAT HAPPENS OCCASIONALLY TR I RECEEMES I I I TURRI TA YE VERY RARE IT RE MINDS ME OF YOUR SCAPEBOARDING CAREER YELOVES A P IS YOU JUST WOREN'T THAT GOOD I WASN'T  GOOD  T OHE KNO WHAT I LOVED MORE THAN SCAPEWOARDIN I LOVE THE COMMUNITY RIGHT I WAS IN I LOVE THE COMMUNITY I WAS IN AND I PUT ANY N I PROLY WOULDHAV GONE TO THE INDUSTRY SIDE OR WORK ON A COMPANY SIDE AND  NOT BEEN ON LESCAP ACTUAL SCAPEERS AT OR JUSTCAPE WORD FOR FUN SO THERE'S A GUY IN THE SCAPE WORK COMMUNIS NAMES JIM THEBO AN HE'SKI TAT THE I NOT SO HID IN SECRET IN IN THAT COMMUNITY HE'S IN AMAZING GUY AND HE'S SORT OF A EARLY ON LEFT PROFESSIONAL SCAPEWORDING TO RUN A COMPANY REAL DELOGHS O MUNCH OF OTHER COMPANIES HE'S AMAZING GOT AND HE TOLD ME THT WED BECOME FRIENDS RECENTLY HE SAID HE REALIZE HE WASN'T GOING BE ONE OF THE BIG GUISES BUTK HE KNEW HE WANT TO BE IN THES COMMUNY SO HE FOUND HIS PLACE AND I THINK EVERYONE IN SCAPE WARN LOOKS TO JIM AS LIKE THUG EY WHO CARE HE'S YOU KNOW HE CARIES HE TRULY CARES ABOUT THE SPORT AND ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND SO HE LEARNED TO KIND OF JUST WRAP HIS ARMS AND HIS HARTD AROUND THE WHOLE THING AND IT JUST WORKS AND SO I DO THING I'M EVERYONE HAS A CERTAIN PLACE I IN A COMMUNIYERN A TEAM I THINK THAT AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING THIS AFT TO IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE ARE LISTENING AND THINKING LIKE WHIL THIS TEAM THING IS AWSOM LIKE IT'S JUST AMAZING I WISH I HAD THAT AD I'M FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT IN MY PODCAST UP HAD THAT MY LAV AS CERTAINLY IN THE MY PODCAST TEAM OUT I I WOULD SAY THESE GUYS GO I GO LIKE I LIKE IT IT'S NOT JUST IT'S TE PEOPLE AT PRESSBUTTONS AROUND CIM AND TAKE PHOTOES LIKE THEY GO I GO LIKE THEY GO IT'S OVER AND I'M FINE WITH THAT I SHOULD LOVE THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S YESS IT'S ABOUT THE PODCAST BUT AND ABOUT THE IN FORMATION IN GETTING IT OUT THERE BUT IT'S AS MUCH ABOUT THE TEAM AND WORKING TOGETHER JUST LIKE IT WAS ESCAPE WORNING SO I HOLE FTHEM BETTER A PODCASSA WAS ESCAPE WHERE I KEF GETTING BROKE OFF AS THE SCAE WHERE TO SAY IN SCAPE WARING TOO OFTEN BUT I WONT TO ASK LIKE IN YOUR FAMILY LIFE DO YOU LOOK AT THAT AS A TEAM LIKE YOU THINK LIKE THIS IS MY TEAM AND THE'RE DIFFERENT AND HOW CAN WE SENNERGIZE AND YOU'VE GOT A LOOK AT EVERYTEAM LIKE THAT OTE OF THE STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IS OF THE TEAM AND WHO'SE CAN BE GOOD AT WHAT AND HOW DO YOU PUT PEOPLE IN POSITIONS WHERE THERE GING TO BE ABLE TO XCELL I MEAN WHAT'S A NAME TEBO IS A JIM THEBO JIM FHEBO YE IMAGINE IF HE HAD A MEN TOR THAT WAS ONLYA SAM LISTEN YOU GOT TO BE A PROSCATER THIS IS YOUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AND HE DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY HOU KNOW ANTMAN LIKE I'M NOT BACK I'M NOT GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH BUT I REALLY LOVE THIS INDUSTRY SO SO IT LUCKILY FOR HIM HE FIGURED THAT OUT AND YOU KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SUPER POWER OF BEING LIKE LOVING YOUR JOB THTHE ONE THING I CLAIM TO BE A SUPER POWER IS THE ABILITY O TAKE A STEP BACK IN DETATCH WHICH I GUESS IT'S GOING BACK TO YOUR MEDITATION THING BUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT YOUR LIFE AND SAY MAN I'V BEEN SCAPE BOARDING LONGER THAN THAT GUY AND HE'S BETTER THAN ME AND I' BEEN SCAPE BOADIN LONGER THAN THAT OF THE GUI AND HE'S BETTER THAN ME I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING THIS PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT JOB FOR ME WHAT COULD I DO WHET I COULD USE MY SKILL SET AND OBVIOUSLY HE HAD SOME MOTROPONORAL SPIRIT AN AND WAS ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT SO BEING ABLE TO BE A PART OF A TEAM AND IT IS GOES TO WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER ABOUT THE MOB BEING ABLE TO BE PART OF A TEAM PART OF THE MOB PART OF THE GANG BUT STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE A STEP BACK DETATCH FROM THAT AND A SESS WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR THIS TEAM TO MOVE FORWARD I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE THIS BRILLIANT IDEA THAT FROM NOW ON YOU'RE GING TO MAKE ALL OF YOUR POD CASTS ABOUT THE MILACULAR STRUCTURE OF WHATEVER AND YOU KNOW THE REST THE TEAM PROBLING TO PULL YOU ASIDE INSO HAYMAN LIKE I KNOW YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S ALLSOME BUT EVERYONE REALLY WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT THIS OTHER STUFF SO LET'S TIE IT IN TOGETHER LET'S EXPAND WHAT YOU THE SPECIFIC THAN YOU AONT TALK ABOUT SO BEING ABLE TO TAKE A STEP BACK DETATCH AND SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE TO ME IS THE TRUE SUPERPOWER OF LIFE OF LIFE AND IT'S IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS AND YOU KNOW THIS GOES BACK TO WHEN YOU TON'T SORT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING GOING THROUGH STRUGGLES IN LIFE RIGHT AND I'VE DESCRIBED THIS BEFORE AS YOUKOW IF I'M LOOKING AT YOU AND YOU'RE YOU'RE IN A BAD STATE RIGHT YOU'RE DEPRESSED YOU'RE SAD YOU'RE MOPING AROUND YOU'RE NOT GETTING NYTHING DONE AND I'M LOOKING AT YOU FROM THE OUTSIDE AND AND I'M THINKING FOR ME I SEE THIS STORM CLOUD AROUND YOUR HEAD RIGHT I SEE THE STORM CLOUD AROUND YOUR HEAD AND YOU'RE IN THERE AND ALL YOU SEE NO MATTER WHAT DIRECTION YOU LOOK IS STORM ALL YOU SEE IS DARKNESS I'M OUTSIDE I'M LOOKING ABOUT THE HAYMAN THAT'S GIT'S GOT A GREAT EDUCATION HE'S HEALTHY HE'S GOT A GOOD TEAM AROUND AND LIKE HE'S GOT ALL THESE THINGS GOING FOR HIM BUT YOU IN THAT STATE YOU LITERALLY CANNOT SEE ANYTHING BUT THE DARKNESS OF THE STORM AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO SCARY ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE ENTER THAT MODE IS YOU CAN LOOK I CAN LOOK AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE AND BE LIKE ANDREW YOU JUST GOT A MOVE LIKE FOUR FEE FORWARD AND YOU'RE GIN TO BE THROUGH THIS THING AND YET YOURE MIGHT HEAR ME SAY THAT YOU' ANO JOCK IM LOOKING HEAD THERE'S NOTHING BUT DARKNESS SO HELPING PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD TAKE ACTION AND BE ABLE TO GET THAT PERSPECTIVE DETACH AND GET OUTSIDE THEMSELVES GET OUTSIDE THEIR OWN HEADS YOURS TEN FARRIS THAT GET OUT YOUR HEAD GET INTO YOUR BODY THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT TAKE ACTION GO DO THINGS BUT IT'S IT'S VERY IT'S VERY SCARING I'M SURE YOU'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE WHERE OU'RE TALKING O SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE BALG DOWN IN WHATEVER PROBLEM IT IS WHATEVER STRESS THEY'RE UND ER AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT I'M GOING AYMAN IT'S GOIN TO BE O CAY LIKE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT WHATEVER THEY'RE WHATEVER IS BOTHERING THEM AND DRAGGIN THEM NOW YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE HEL LOT T TIME'S RELATIONSHIP RIGHT THE THE GIRL OF THE GUY THEY  THEY GOT DUMPED AND YOU GOT PAYMANT THAT PERSON WAS A DISASTER ANYWAYS YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT EM AND THEY CANNOT COMPUTE THAT THEY'RE STUCK THERE OR MAYBE IT'S THE SCHOOL THAT THEY DIDN'T GET INTO OR THE JOB THAT THEY DIDN'T GET AND THEY GET SO RAPPED UP AND THAT THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF THAT STORM AND IT'S IT'S SO IT'S SUCH A HELPLESS FEELING TO TO SIT THERE AND TELLSOME ONE HEY YOU YOU YOU YOUJUST MOVE A LITTLE BUT TOWARDS ME AND YOU'R IN A GE GET OUT OF THIS STORM AND IT'S SO MUCH EASIER SAID THAN DONE AND AND THAT'S WHY TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE IN TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE THAT SUPER POWER OF DETACHMENT WHERE THEY CAN TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE RIGHT MAN THAT THAT GIRL SHE SHE WASN'T WHO I REALLY THOUGHT SHE WAS I SHOULD MOVE ON YES BUT EASIER SAID THAN DONE AND THAT'S ONEOF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES I THINK THAT THAT WE HAVE AS FRIENDS AND IN PARENTS AND A TEAMATES IS HELPING PEOPLE LEARN TO DETACH LEARNED TO SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE LEARNE TO SEE THAT THE THE PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU'R WHOLE WORLD IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT BIG OF O DEAL YOU WHEN I WROTE I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT YOU KID'S BOOKS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TRIGGERED ME TO WRITE KID'S BOOKS IS REALIZING THAT YOU DON'T WHAT ONE DAY MY DAUGHTER CAME HOME I'S MY OLDEST DAUGHTER AND SHE CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND SHE'S LIKE I SHE SAYS I'M STUPID WHAT HE MEAN YOUR STUPID SHEI'M STUPID I'M DUMB WHY DO YOU THINK THAT KNOW IT WHAT EVER GRATE IT IS WHEN YOU'E MUST TO KNOW YOUR TIMES TABLES I DON'T KNOW MY TIMES TABLES I SU OH WELLHOW MUCH OF YOU STUDIED SHE KINNA GAVE ME THE THE THE CONFUSED LOOK WHT YOU WHWHATD HE MEAN STUDIED I SUD HAVE YOU STUDIED YET IF YOU MADE FLASHCARS TO TO LEARN THEM AND SHE DIDN'T SHE HADN'T SHE THOUGHT SHE SHOULD JUST KNOW THEM FROM YER TO TEACHHER WENE OVER WHAT THEY ARE NOW SHE YOU DON'T LIKE THAT SOME OTHER KIDS IN A CLASTID AND AND SO I'M SIT NICENIA COOL WLL JUST YOU KNOW WE'LL MAKE SOMEFLASHCARDS IF SHE MAKE FLASHCARD SHE LEARN HER TTELL TIMESTABLES AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND WE'RE GOOD BUT WHAT STRUCK ME WAS TO ME ALLS I OWNT O BID DEAL TO HER IT WAS HER WHOLE LIFE AND THEN I GOT TO SEE THAT WITH MY OTHER KIDS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING TO THEM IN THE RECESS YARD AND I LIKE ALL SCREW THAT KID DINN'T WIT THE THERE DON'T WORRY BOUT THEM BUT WHEN YOU'RE THAT'S THEIR WHOLE WORLD AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T ONLY APPLY TO KIDS YOU'D APPLIES TO DON'TS AS WELL AND THEY GET THIS PROBLEM IN THEIR WORLD THAT SEEM SO INSURMOUNTABLE AND SO MASSIVE BECAUSE THAT LITTLE EGO SYSTEM THAT THEIRE STUCKING IS THEIR WORLD AND THEY RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM IN THAT AND IT'S JUST RUPTIVE IN THAT WORLD AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF IT NOE  I DID A PODCAST TALKING ABOUT THESE EGO SYSTEMS AT PEOPLE GET INTO RIGHT ANDTHERE'S ALL THESE EGO SYSTEMS YEURN NEGO SYSTEM WE'RE WE'RE BOTH IN IT A SHARED EGO SYSTEM OF PODCASTING AND WE COULD BE LIKE ALL MY GOSH YOU LACXS JUST CAME OUT WITH A NEW PODCAST AND IT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST SUCCESS AND WHAT CAN I DO TO CATCH UP WITH WAX AND AND ALTHE SO I COULD GET REALLY BY YOU COULD GET RALY BY WE COULD BE BOTHERED BY THAT TO THINK MAN I'M A FAILURE MEANWHILE YOU THERE'S PEOPLE THAT DON'T LISTEN TO PODCAST US PEOPLE THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A PODCAST IS AND YET IT'S OUR WHOLE WORLD IF WE LET IT YOU'RE IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD HE YOU GO YOU YOU'RO PROFESSOR AT STAMPFORD WHICH IS A BIG DEAL IN THAT WORLD I KNOW PEOPLE THAT DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS THEY COULDN'T THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE STAMP FOR IT IS I GET THAT ALL A THE I DON'T KNOW WHISE THANFER THAT IIT'S NOBODY DEAL IN THE SUALTEM SAME THING SOMEBODY HAS A PROBLEM IN THE SEALTINS AND THEY THINK THIS IS THE WHOLE WORLD AND I BLEW IT AND AND NOW WHAT ARE THEY GOINGTO DO WHEN YOU'RE FACING A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN LIFE RELATIONSHIP A PROM WITH A JOB YOU GONT REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE IN ONE ECO SYSTEM AND IF YOU'RE STEP OUTSIDE OF THAT ECO SYSTEM NO ONE REALLY CARS AND YOU COULD GOG OVER TO OLD HEY TOTALLY DIFFERENT ECO SYSTEM AND AND FIND HAPPINESS THERE BUT AT LEAST OUTILIZE THAT TO GET OUT OF THAT STORM CROB THAT YOU'RE IN AND YOU'REGING TO FIND THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF LIGHT OUT THERE IN THE WORLD MOVE TOWARDS THAT AND IT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH BETTER SITUATION IN THE SPIRIT OF AUTHENTICITY EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING IT'S DIRECTLY HOME FOR ME YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF ME ARE I ACTUALLY TRY NOT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME THINKING ABOUT THAT AND JUST REALLY TRY AND STAY AND TOUCH WITH THE SOURCE AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE IN THE SNOTION THAT OUR LOVE OF THINGS IS WHAT CAN GENERATE ENERGY AND I TRY AND USE ACTION TO GENERATE ENERGY BUT ALSO I HAPPENED ALSO LOVE EXERCISE SO THAT'S AN EASY ONE THERE FOR ME BUT I TRY AND STAY IN THAT MODE BUT I'M TO BE QUITE HONEST I'VE SPENT MUCH OF MY ADULT LIFE AND PROBABLY TOO MUCH OF MY TEEN AGE LIFE AN TWENTIES WE'RE NOT QUITE IN ADULT RIGHT IN YOUR TWENTIES AT LEAST THAT I CERTAINLY WASN'T IN CHALLENGING RELATIONSHIPS THAT ADMITTEDLY WE'RE CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF MY ROLL IN THEM ALSO OF COURSE RIGHT AND EACH IN EVERY TIME I REMEMBER THINKING MOVING ON FROM THIS IS LIKE THIS INSURMOUNTABLE THING IN PART BECAUSE I 'M A CARETAKER AND I CARED AND YOU KNOW IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT ME AND A SELFISHNESS IT WAS ABOUT WANTING TO RIGHT ALL THE WRONGS OF THAT PERSONS PAST LIKE YOU NOV FOUND MYSELF TRYING TO BE A TIME MACHINE FOR PEOPLE IVE FOUND MYSELF TRYING TO FIX THEIR FAMILY LIVES I'VE FOUND MYSELF DOING ALL OF THAT AND ALSO IGNORING ALL THE THINGS I NEED TO FOCAS ON IN TERMS OF BETTERING MYSELF AND MAKING SHROW F SHOWING UP CORRECT AND ON AND ON AND I'M THERE ARE DATA IN THE WORLD OF IN THE FORM OF THESE PEOPLE THAT THAT KNOW ME VERY VERY WELL THAT I THINK WOULD SAY THAT IN A WHOLE LOT MORE RIGHT I'M THE POINT ISN'T THOSE SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT EACH IN EVERY TIME YOU KNOW SOME ONE WOULD COME ALONG AND SAY LIKE LISTEN IF THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR YOU IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THEM OR THIS IS A BAD SITUATION OR THIS ISN'T SERVING EITHER OF YOU WELL BUT I WAS LIKE MY OPICTHIS BIG AND TH NOT EVEN SO TO STROV YOU OF THE WORLD LIKE SAND SPECK OF THE WORLD AND TRYNG A SOLVE CAUSE THAT'S MY NATIAL I RESOLVE THAS IM ONE SOLVEIT O MANA SOLVE IT AND SOMETIMES THINGS WERE SOLVED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND SOMETIMES THEY WEREN'T AND I THINK ONE THING THAT JUST AS A CONFESSIONAL LIKE I WILL SAY I'M I COULD REALLY LEARN THE ART OF DETACHMENT I COULD REALLY LEARNED TO FOCUS ON THAT MORE IF THAT'S THE PROPER LANGUAGE WORT I THINK I'M PRETTY GOOD IT ADAPTING I THING 'M PRETTY GOOD AT FINDING GOOD PEOPLE AN CERTAINLY LOVE MY TEAM AN THIS AND THAT ALL FEELS LIKE NATURAL ENERGY ALTHOUH IT'S HARD WORK YOU LABIN IN THE PODCAST BUT I THINK THE THE SORT OF A TENDENCY THAT HAVE AS A PROBLEM SOLVER IS TO ASSUME THE EVERY PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED AND THERE FORE STAYING ON THIS PROBLEM UNTIL IT IS SOLVED IS THE ANSWER AND UM MAYBE THE ARTOF DETACHMENT IN GETTING SOME PERSPECTIVE WOULD HELP BECAUSE IF I LOOK BACK I CERTAINLY DON'T REGRET THE EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD BUT I WASTED FAR TOO MUCH TIME AND THAT FRANKLY HAVE PROBABLY WASTED FAR TOO MUCH OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TIME TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT COULD NOT BE SOLVED AND I THINK UM WITHOUT GOING INTO THIS IN ANY MORE DETAIL UM AND OF COURSE I YOU'RE NOT O YOU CAN SEND ME A BILL AT THE END BY THE WAY UM I THINK THI THI SOLESTIONS ARE FREEMAN YES SO I THINK THAT THEING A PROBLEM SOLVER'S GREAT BEING FORWARD CENTER MASSIS GREAT I THINK LEARNING THE SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AN BODY AND UNDERSTANDING PSYCHOLOGY AND IN LEARNING ABOUT ONESELF YOU KNOW THE ORACLE HAD IT RIGHT KNOW THYSELF IN WAYS THAT YOU CAN MANEUVR FUNCTIONALLY IN YOUR LIFE AND CAREER IN RELATIONSHIP AT CETERA GREAT BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO A DOWNSIDE TO BEING OVERLY FIXATED DOES IK MY BULLDOG COSTELLES BE LIKE CHEWING ON SOMETHING CHEWING US IN NEXT AN I KNOW YOS CHUN ON IS FOOT IN YOU'R LIKE HAY AND YOU'D HAFE LIKE RIP EM OFF AS OWN FOODNE B CASE THAT CHEW REFLECTS WAS JUST SO STRONG THAT SOMETIMES IT WOULD TURN ON HIMSELF THAT'S KINT O HOW HOW IT FEELS YEI WROTE A BOOK CALD LEADERS OC TRAVETY INTACTICS IN ONE OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WROTE ABOUT IN THAT BOOK IS LIKE UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S IMPORTANT WHAT'S NOT AND THIS IS VERY VERY SIMILAR WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING LOOKING AT A PROBLEM AND TAKIN STAP BACKING ON IT WELL E IS IS IMPORTANT OR NOT AND BE IS IT SOLVEABORE IS IT NT AND SEE WHAT'S THE OROWHI ON GETTING IT SOLVELEM LET'S THE EFFORTS CONG TO TAKE TO GET THIS PROBLSOLV AN HOWINS IS REALLYGAN T IMPACT MY WORLD AND MY LIFE IF I FOCUS ON IT SO KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING WHEN SOMETHING'S IMPORTANT OR NOT IS A VERY GOOD SKILL AND AGAIN IT'S A SKILL IT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO ATTACHMENT DETACHMENT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT RELATION IT'S NOTHING I EEN TOLLN PEOPLE ILY THE THE THE THE SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM IS NOT GOING O BE FOUND IN THE PROBLEM I'S NOT CANT BE FOUND IN THERE YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE PROBLEM SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT IT MAK AN ASSASSMENT AND YOU CAN ASSASS HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OR WHETHER YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLER NOT I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFE FOR A NOW ORIT SHROG MY SHOULDERS GOK BUT IT'S OOK O  SOME ONE SAYING THIS  RODER THAT CARRY ON NO FACTOR MOVE ON AND THEN OCCASIONALLY YOU GON'T OK IK THIS IS SOMETHING I NEEDTO CONTENT WITH THES SOMETHING YO DEAL WITH THIIS SOMETHING I NEED TO SHAPE OR A JOSTOR MOVE OR OR SOLVE TO USE TO USE YOUR WORD AN  REASON I LAFE WHEN I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE SPROBLEMS YOU HAVE TO GET IN THERE BUT IF YOU TAKE A STEP BACK YOU CAN USE LY SA O LITTLE ADJUSTMENT HERE LITTLE DJUSTMENT THERE AND THAT THINGS CAN A SORT ITSELF OUT SO DETACHMENT IS A SUPERPOWERMENT CERTAINLY IS AND IT'S CERTAINLY ONE THAT I NEEDS O FOCUS ON MORE I'M I'M GRATEFUL FOR A BRINGING THAT UP IS THIS IS THE A BIOLOGIST IN ME BUT IU A WHAT IS YOUR PROCESS FOR ENGAGING DETACHMENT OR FOR DISENGAGING IS IT A ACTIVE PROCESS RE YO YOU I 'M GET A DETACH FROM THIS IM WENE T PUT MYSELF IN A SITUATION THAT IS PULLING ON ME THERE'S IS GRAVITATIONAL FORCE AND I'M GETTING I CREATSOME IMAGRY IN MY MIND OF WALKING AWAY FROM IT DO I PHYSICALLY WALK AWAY FROM IT DO I OUT SORCE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHAT IT WHAT ARE SOME TOOLS FOR DETACHMENT THEO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU AND I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND T A PRACTICAL APPLICATION A LINE SO MY ORIGINAL EXPERIENCE WITH DETACHMENT WAS AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU NO I SAD A LOT OF TIME'S THINGS ARE JUST SMALL MOMENTS OVER TIME AND YOU MAKE A LITTLEADJUSTMENT THIS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS IN MY LIFE AND I WROTE ABOUT LEADERSHIP'STRAGING TACTICS WHERE I RECOGNIZED LIKE IN A MOMENT WHAT DETACHMENT WAS AND HOW HELPFUL IT WAS I'M ON AN OIL RIG DOING A TRAINING MISHION MY WHOLE PLATOON IS IN A SKIRMISH LINE LOOKING AT A A LARGE AREA OF THE OIL RIG THAT WERE SPPOSE TO BE CLEARING AGAIN THIT'S NOT COMBAT THIS IS IN THE NINETEES TERE'S NOTHING GONE ONWADS DOING TRAINING AND I'M STANDING IN A SKIRMISH LINE AND BY THE WAY I'M THE YOUNGEST AND MOST JUNIOR GUINE MIPLETUN AND I'M STANDING THERE LOOKING DOWN THE SIGHT OF MY WEAPON AND I'M WAITING FOR SOME ONE TO MAKE A CALL AND TELL US WHAT TO DO AND I WAIT FOR FIVE SECONDS AND I WAIT FOR TEN SECONDS AND I WAIT FOR TWENTY SECONDS O NO ONE SAYING ANYTHING AND WE'RE WAITING FOR EIG LEADER IN MY PLATOON TO TO MAKE A CALL TO TELL US WHAT TO DO TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND FINALLY AFTER LIKE THIRTY SECONDS WHICH SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE AND SO I TAKE A STEP LIKE A LIKE A A FOOT ONE FOOT STEP TWELVE INCHES I TAKE A STEP OFF THE SKIRMISH LINE I LOOK TO MY LEFT I LOOK TO MY RIGHT AND WHAT I SEE IS EVERY OTHER GUI IN MY PLATON IS STARING DOWN THEIR WEAPON STARING DOWN THE SIGHT OF THER WEAPON WHICH MEANS THERE FIELD OF VIEW IS TINY IT'S LIKE A TWENTY DEGREE FIELD OF YOU YOU'RE LOOKING DOWN THE THE SCOPE OF YOUR WEAPON ORE THE SIGTE OF YOUR WEAPON AND THAT'S HOW BIG TOERE FIELD OF YEWS TAT I'M LOOKING I'M THINKING OH THERE'S MY PLATON COMMANDER HE'S LOOKING DOWN THE SCOPE OF THE SIGHT OF HIS WEAPON THERE'S MY POTUN CHIEF HE'S LOOKING DWN THE SID O HIS WEAPON THRE'S MY LEADING PETTYOFFSOR HE'S LOOKING DOWN THE SIDE OF HIS WEAPON THERE'S MY SISTEM TUN COMMANDER HE'S LOOKING DON SO EVERY ONE IN THE POATONE IS LOOKING DON THE SIDE OF THEIR WEAPON WHICH MEANS THEY ALL HAVE A VERY NARROW FIELD DOVISION WEL WHN'T I TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK TO MY LEFT AND LOOK TO MY RIGHT GUESS WHAT KIN A FEELD O VISION I GOT I OT A MASSIVE ONE I CAN SEE THE WHOLE SCENE AND I CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE NEED TO DO AND AT THAT MOMENT LOOK AS A NEW GUY YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING AND I'M THINKING WELL BUT NO ONE ELSE IS SAYING ANYTHING SO I MUSTER UP ALL THE COURAGE I CAN AND I OPEN MY MOUTH AND I SAY HOLD LEFT CLEAR RIGHT WHICH IS A BASIC TACTICALL CALL NON'T NO NO THIS IS NOT A PATAN LEVEL GENIOUS MANEUVER IT JUST THE NORMAL CALL TO MAKING A SITUATION THAT WE WERE IN I SAY HOLD LEFT CLEAR RIGHT AND I'M EXPECTING TO GET KIND OF SLAP TOLD SHUT UP NEWGUY BUT INSTEAD EVERY ONE JUST REPEATS THE CALL HOLD LEFT CLEAR RIGHT HOLD LEFT CLEAR RIGHT AND THEY WE EXECUTE THE MANEUVER AND WE FINISH THE CLEARIENCE OF THIS OIL RIG AND WE'LL GET DONE WE GET THE THE TOP OF THE OIL RIG WHICH MEANS WE CLEAR THE HLE THING R ON THE HEELO DECK AT THE TOP AND WE GOIN TO DEBRI AND NOW I'M EXPECTING LOOK A NOW HEN TO GET TOLD AY WHAT WEEYOU DOING YOU CAN NED TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND INSTEAD THE POTUNE CHIEF GOES A HAY JOCK O GOOD CALL ON THE CELLAR DECK DOWN THERE AND I WAS KINDLIKE THAT'S RIGHT BUT THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF HOLL ON A SECOND WHY IF O'M THE YOUNGEST MOST JUNIOR GUY IN THIS PATOON WHY WAS I ABLE TO SEE WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND MAKE THAT CALL WHY DID THAT WHY DIT THAT JUST HAPPON AND THEN I REALIZED IT WAS CAUSE I T TOOK A STEP BACK TO OUSE A YOUR TURM I BROADENED MY FIELD OF VIEW WHICH ALLOWED ME TO THINK MORE CLEARLY CAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING HYPERFOLK IS TO NARROWLY FOCUST I BROADEN MY RANGE OF VISION I TOOK A BREATH BEFORE I MADE MY CALL RIGHT I AD TO TAKE MY U TAKE A A NICE BREATH TO TO SPEAK CLEARLY AND I REALIZED THAT TAKING A STEP BACK AND DETACHING I GOT TO SEE INFINITELY MORE THAN EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCE GUISE IN MY PATOON AND I STARTED DOING IT ALL THE TIME IN IT I STARTED DOING IT IN LAND WARFARE I STARTED DOING IT IN URBAN COMBAT I STARTED DOING IT IN ALL THESE TACTICAL TRAINING SNARISY JUS JUST TRAINING IS TE IGNS START A DOING THESE TRAINKSNERS AND IT ALWAYS ALLOWED ME TO SEE WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND THEN I STARTED DOING IT LIKE WHEN I WAS HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE AND HAVING A CONVERSATION MY PORTON CHIEF AN I CAN SEE IT HES START TO TURN A LITTLE RED IN THE FACE AND I WE  WER WE'RE ABOUT TO ARGUE ABOUT SOMETHING I SO O IT A SECOND I'ML TAKE A STEP BACK LOOKING VHOTE HE'S GETT MADRIGHT NOW AND HE'S THE POTOON CHIEF YOU BETTER JUST DOESCOLATE THIS THING REAL QUICK ND I A KNOW AT CHIEFE THAT SOUNDS GOO INE L TAKE A RELINEA  RELOOK AT THE PLAN OR WHATEVER AND SO I STARTED TO DO THIS KIND O WITH MY NORMAL LIFE WAS TON NOT GET WRAPPED UP IN MY OWN EMOTIONS NOT GET WRAPPED UP IN THE THE THE GUN FIGHT THAT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE NOT TO GET RAPPED UP IN THE DETAILS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT INSTEAD TAKE A STEP BACK DETACH LOOK AROUND AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE A BET MUCH MUCH BETTER DECISION AND IT'S NOT IT IT'S EXPENENTIAL YOU IF YOU'RE LOOKING DOWN THE SIGHTS YOUR WEAPON AND YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND YOU LOOK AROUND IT'S EXPENENTIAL HOW MUCH MORE YOU CAN SEE ELLISON IF YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON IN THE GUN FIGHT IT'S GON BE HARDER FOR YOU TO DO THAT CAUSD YOU GOT O BE FOCUSSED ON WHATEVER YOU'RE SHOOTING AT BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SIXTEEN GUYS OR TWENTY GUIES THE'RE ALL LOOKING THE SAME DIRECTION IT'S VERY EASY TO BE THE GUYTICOES ON TO TAKE A STEP BACK LOOK AROUND MAKE A CALL SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE MECHANICS WHEN I TEACH THIS TO PEOPLE NOW THE MECHANICS OF IT TAKE A STEP BACK LITERALLY YOU'RE AT YOU KNOW YOU AND I AR  A MEETING THERE'S BUNCH PEOPLE THE STARTS TO GET HEATED ARGUMENT I WILL LITERALLY PUSH MY CHAIR BACK AWAY FROM THE TABLE CHANGE MY PERSPECTED PERSPECTIVE OPEN WHY IN MY FIELD OF VIEW THE OTHERR THO THING LIKE ALL T IN IN THE SILTIMES YOU DON'T WANT O YOU DON'T WANT A SOUND PANIC ON THE RADIO FOR A COUPLE REASONS NUMBER ONE BECAUSE WHEN YOU PANIC ON THE RADIOTS CAN CAUSE OF THE PEOPLE TO PANIC NUMBER TWO IF YOU PANIC ON THE RADION YOU SOUND PANIC EVEH CON TO MAKE FNNY SO YOU RE DON' YOU GET BACK FOR THE MISSIONEVER T GO TOWAYE YOU SOUNDED LIKE A BABY OUT THERE SO WHAT WOULD I DO BEFORE I WOULD KEY UP MY RADIO TAKE A BREATH AND SO HERE I'M MANOUALLY SLOWING DOWN MY BREATH I'M BROADENING MY FIELD OF VIOU SO IF YOU'RE IN A MEETING OR YOU'RE IN A YOU KNO YOU'RE AT THE AT THE SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT AND SOME ONE STARTS TO YELL IT YOU TAKE A STEP BACK TAKE A BREATH BROADEN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW DETATCH FROM THOSE EMOTIONS THAT YOU'RE HAVENNG AND MAKE SOME SPACE AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW I GO THROUGH THE MECHANICS OF DETACHMENT NOW I CAN TELL YOU IT NOW I MEAN WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU DO THIS ALL THE TIME WHICH I KIND TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME I DON'T I DON'T  HAVE TO LIKE STEP BACK BUT WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO BE ALD TO TRY AND DO THIS ABSOLUTELY MAKE A AND NOT SAY IN HRE'S ANOTHER LIKE WEIRD LITTLE NEW ANTS THING LIFT YOUR CHIN UP AND PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN NOW THIS ISN'T NOT TA COMBATS SUCH A RASE NOT NOT TA FIGHT BUT HERE'S A THING WHEN WHEN WHEN I GET DEFENSIVE WHAT AM I GINGTO  RAISE MY HANDS UPAND PUT MY CHIN DOWN IT'S LIKE A FIGHTING MODE SO IF YOU AND I ARE HAVEN'T A DISCUSSION AND I'M STARTINGTO GET HEATED N O'M STARTIN TO LIKHE OH HE'S NOT LISTENING TO ME INSTEAD OF ME PUTTING MY CHIN DOWN AND AND PUT MY HANDS LIKE UP UP TO I CAN PUT HIM IN YOUR FACE A LITTLE BIT NO I SHAN'T TAKE A STEP BACK FROM SA PUT MY CHIN UP I CHANGES MY PERSPECTIVE A LTTA IT MORE CHANGES MY VISUILL PERSPECTIVE JUST BT E CHANGE IN THE ANGLE OF MY HEAD TAKE A STEP BACK PUT MY HANDS DOWN A NOPPING INTO DEFENSI I ACTUALLY WHEN O HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND IF I START LISTENING TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND NOT TALKING IT'S VERY HARD TO BE DETACHED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING 'S ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT YOU WANTED TO TATCH SHOT YOUR MOUTH SO I'M IN MEETINGS AN I IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES I'M RUNNING AB I HAVE A BUNCH NAT I OWN'T A BUNCH DIFFENT COMPANIES I'M IN A MEETING IN MY COMPANIES I'M NOT THE ONE THAT'S DOING ALL THE TALKINING IN FACT I'M DOING MOSTLY LISTENING WHEN I'M IN TASKU AT BRUISER MY ASKING IT I'M NOT SITTING THERE GIVING THE ENTIRE BRIEF NOW I'M LETTIN THE PORTUNE CHIEF IN THE POTUNE COMMANDERS GIVE THOSE BRIEFS IM NOT WHY I'M DETACHED I'M LISTENING TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY I'M MORE CAPABLE OF SEEING WHAT HOLDS THERE ARE IN THEIR PLANS BY NOT MOVING MY MOUTH NOT TALKING I'M LISTENING SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE METHODOLOGIES THAT I USE AN  I ADVISE PEOPLE TO USE IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY START DOWN THE PATHWAY OF BEING ABLE TO DETACH IN VARIOUS SEMARIOLS I LOVE IT AGAIN I'M SAYING I LOVE IT BECAUSE I DO LOVE IT AND THANK YOU I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL TECHNIQU WE'VE TALKED BEFORE IN YOUR PODCAS AN A SOME OF MY LISTENERS MAY BE NOT ALL AM THIS PODCAST WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN WE NARROWLY FOCUSS OUR GAZE ON ONE TARGET A NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPEND OUR VISUAL WORLD BECOMES CONSTRICTED OF COURSE BUT ALSO THAT WE START SLICING TIME MORE FINELY AND THE DOPAMIN SYSTEM TENDS TO START DOING A KIND OF  ANTICIPATION AND TRYING TO GUIDE AND DIRECT THINGS IN THAT NARROW TUNNEL OF VIEW RAS WHEN WE LITERALLY TAKE ON PANORAMIC VISIONS AND OTINO SILLY MOVING OUR HEAD AROUND ALTHOUGH ONE COULD ABROADENING OUR FIELD OF YIEW OR LOOKING A HORIZON SPECIALLY FOR WALKING BUT GAIN THAT KIND OF NOT KIND OF GETTING A BROADER FIELD OF VIEW WE SLICE TIME DIFFERENTLY THINGS DON'T FEEL AS IMPOSING ON US UM THIS IS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE UNDERLYING WHAT YOU' YOU'RE DESCRIBING AND I THINK IT'S AM IT GOES A STEP FURTHER BECAUSE IN THAT OPEN LARGER APERTURE OF VISUAL UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A OPEN LARGER WINDOW OF COGNITIFE UNDERSTANDING AND NEW OPTION STARTS A SURFACE RIGHT I MEAN I THINK THIS IS I'VE LONG BEEN FASTENING BY THE FACT THAT THIS I SHOULD BE I'LL TELL US THE REAL QUICK STORY I IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I WAS IM I WENT OVER TO SPAIN TO DO SOME MOUNTAINEERING WITH WHIM HOFF IF THIS WASN'T AS I WANTO PODCAST AT AND HAVE ANY SOCIAL MEYA JUST WENT OVER THERE AS I'D HARD THE SKY WHIM CONTACT IN THEM SOMEHOW ARRANGE A TRIP FOR MYSELF AND I WENT OVER THERE AND WE DID SOME CRAZY DANGEROUS MOUNTAINEERING THI NO BUSINESS DOING ALMOST RIPPED MY LEFT LEG OFF IN A STUNT THAT WAS ORGANIZED BY OTHERS THERE AT I NEVER SHOULD HAVE DONE IN ANY CASE ONE DAY ILOOK AND WOMENS LIKE CROUCHED ON THE GROUND NEXT TO LIKE A CURB IN THIS PARKING LOT BEFORE A HEIGHT HE'S DOWN THE N THE ROUND THE LITTLE STICK AND I WHAT AR YOU DOING HE'S LIKE LOOK DTHERE WERE AUNTS CLIMBING UP THIS THING IN HE'S LIKE THEIR MOUNTAINEERING THIS CURB AND NOT ON THISKY DIFFERENT RIGHT BUT THEN I REALIZED WE WERE ABOUT TO DO THE SAME THING UP THIS BIG FACE AND I THOUGHT WELL LAKE HE'S ABLE TO THINK AT THESE DIFFERENT SCALES AND SEE SIMILARI IS I LET LET'S PREK GO I WOULD HAVE NEVER STOP TO LOOK THERE AND I'LL I STILL REMEMBER IT RIGHT I WAS IT PROFOUND NO WAS IT INTERESTING YEIN THE SENSE THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING AT ALL SCALES ALL THE TIME AND WE WE THINK WE KNOW THE SCALE TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST AND I THIN IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN A GUN FIGHT LIKE THERE IS A SCALE THAT MATTERS MOST BUT NEW OPTIONS NEW PERSPECTIVES ACTUALLY COME FROM THAT BROADER FEELD OF YOU WISH IS WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AND LATER THAT DAY IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS GROUP GOING UP SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY CHALLENGED IN THE IN THE DECLIME AND WEN WENT BACK TO THIS EXAMPLE OF HOW THE ANTS WOULD STACK ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHERAND HE ISED AN ANALOGY FROM THAT TO HELP PEOPLE THROUGH THIS CLIME THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL POOL AT THE TOP ET CETER AT CETER ANYWAY I THINK THAT THESE EXAMPLES AM ARE IN FACT MEANINGFUL ESPECIALY THE ONES THAT YOU GAVE BECAUSE THEY DON'T JUST RELATE TO MILITARY EM YOU IMAGINE AROUND THE DINNER TABLE I'VE HAD THIS YOU KNOW GETS TER THERE AND PARTNERS THERE AND SO NIMES IT'S REALLY NICE TO SIT BACK AND JUST CA HERE IT ALL IN BASKIN IT ALL BUT OFTENTIMES LIKE NEW INFORMATION WILL SURFACE LIKE YE SAID YOU KNOW THIKE ALL I'M HEARING HIS WORRIES OUT OF THIS PERSONER THEY'RE NOT EVEN REALLY HERE THEY'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NEX NEXT TIME NEXT TIME NEXT TIME AND UNLIKE YOU REANCHOR PEOPLE LIKE HALIC MAYBE LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE OR SOMETIMES YEELAR HIPERFOLK IS ONE WONE'S HAPPENING THERE O THEY NEEN TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE I LOVE THIS I NEED TO PRACTISE DETACHMENT IN NUMBER DIFFERENT DOMAINS O MY LIFE I'M ONE THING THAT I I'M REALIZING AFTER HEARING YOU AM DESCRIBE THE PROCESS THEYRE REALLY NEED TO DO AS I NEED TO START TAKING IM SOME TIME AWAY FROM MY WORK MAYBEVEN ELIVIT OF TIME PARALLEL TO RELATIONSHIP TO SO GET PER BETTER PERSPECTIVE ON IT BECAUSE I THINK THE PROBLEM SOLVING NATURE AN US REALLY MAKES US MYOPIC REALLY MAKES US NEER SIDED YET'S A YOU SEE THIS A LOT I MEAN I I GET TO SEE THIS A LOT WE DO EVENTS WITH COMPANY'S BUSINESSES AND WE GO OFFSIGHT SOMEWHERE WERE THEY'RE DETACHED THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE THEY'RE DEFACT O DETACHED FROM THEY'RE DATEDAY BUSINESS YOU PULL SOME ONE OUT OFTHE BUSINESS FOR TWO DAYS AN ALL THE SUN THEY START SEEN THE SOLUTIONS BUT THEY NET THEY NEVER SEE THEM TE IT'S LOT HORDER FOR THEM TO SEE THEM WHEN THEY'RE IN THE FIRE FIGHT YOU GET THEM OUT OF THE FIRE FIGHT IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO SEE WHEN TE'RE IN THAT ACQUISITION AT THEY'RE DOING HOW WE GAN MERGE THESE TWO CULTURES THITSIS GING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BOM PULL EM OUT ARE I LET'S TALK ABOUT TWO CULTURES AND AND LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT POSSIBLE OUTCOMES ARE AND ALL THE O WHEN YOU GET THEM TO TAKE A STEP BACK THE THESE SOLUTIONS WILL APPEAR AND AND IT IS TRUE IN A GUN FIN OLLISAN IF IT'S A ONE ON ONE GONE FIGHT EVEN THEN BE ABILITY TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AROUND WOR USE YOUR PERFIAL VISION YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE IT'S EXPINENTIAL HOW MUCH EITING THAT'S WHY IT'S LIKE A SUPER POWER IT'S LIKE CHEATING IT'S IT'S LIKE CHEATING N I'S SPEAKING OF SETSTONE SETSTONE TOOK OVER A WE HE BECAME A TASKOU TO COMMANDER OR TROOP COMMANDER WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM ROMOTI AND SO NOW HE'S THE GYING CHARGEAN NOW I WAS

TRAINING EXERCISER FULL MISSION PROFASSOAT'S IKE A BIG FATE OPERATION THERE'S A FATE TARGET THERE'S FATE BAD GUYS WERE USING THESE LAZER THESE HIGH SPEED LAZER GUNS TO SHOOT AND WE'RE WORK IN OF STANDING ON THIS LITTLE BURN AND AT A CERTAIN POINT IN THE OPERATION HIS WHOLE TASK UNIT LIKE FORTY GUYES GETS PIN DOWN IN THIS LITTLE RAVINE AND SO WORST KIND OF STANDING IN THE RAVINE WITH THESE GUYS AND NO ONE'S MAKING ANY DECISIONS AND THE ENEMY WITH THESE LAZIER GUNS OUR STARTIN A MANEUVERANC STARTIN IT THEU'RE KILLING GUYES CAUSE HESE LAZER GUNS YOU CAN DUIE AND SETH LIKE ETS ME ON THE ARM IS A CAN I CANNOT TELL HIM WHAT TO DO AND I'LL LIKE NOT BUT LET HIM FINGURET OUT SO ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS PASS ANOTHER GUY GOT'S KILLED WITH LAZER HE GET'S ME A CONPROLL LET ME LET ME SAY SOME TO HIM AND I'LL LIKE NO LET LET HIM FIGUR IT OUT ANOTHER MINUTE GOES BY TWO MORE GUYS ARE NOW DEAD JUST LAZER DEAD BUT THEY'RE DEAD AND HE GETS ME AGAIN  HE'S LIKE PRO LET ME TELL HIM I GO IR GOAD TEL AND SO HE JUS CROUCH IS DOWN NEXT TO ONE THE GUSIN BANGS HIM ON ASTERD PEL RIGHT AND WHICH IS A AGAIN IT'S JUST A FUNDAMENTAL BASIC CALL AND THE GUY SHOUTS IT OUT BE'LL RIGHT AND THEY START PUNRINE IN ANOTHER MINUTE LATER THEY'RE ALL OUT OF THE KILLS ON AND EVERYTHING O KE AND THEN SETH LOOKS AT ME AN HE GOES MAN THIS IS SO EASY WAY UP HERE AND I SAID BRO LOOK IT WHERE WE ARE WE'RE IN THE RAVINE WITH THE GUYSE WE'RE NOW WE'RE ON A KNEE AND THE GUYS ARE LAYING DOWN BUT IT'S NOT THIS WE WEREN'T ON SOME ELEVATED POSITION AND I SAID HEY IT'S NOT THAT WHEN AN ELEVETY POSITION IT JUST THAT WE'RE DETACHED AND LOOKING AROUND HE GOES ON MY GOD AND I SAID HEY YOUR MEMBER WHEN YOU AND I WENT THROUGH THIS TRAINING AND HE GOES YANIGA THIS IS WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR ME ALL THE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY JUST LOOKING AROUND SO THAT'S WHY IT SEEMS LIKE A MAGIC POWER RIGHT IT'S LIKE A SUPERPOWER CAUSE YOU D SETS DOWN THERE WITH THIS GUN AND HES SHOOTING OM LIKE HEBRO MOVE YOUR GYS OVER THAT GO THAT RID'S IN RIGHT THEIR SUCH A CURITYPONT AND HE HOW DID HOW DI JOCKLO SEE THAT JOCKLE MUST BE ATTACKED CGENUS NOT AMOT ATACTICAL GENIUS I'M JUST TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING AROUND AND THIS AND LIKE YOU JUST SAID IT APPLIES TO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IF YOU'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER AND YOU START TO SEE THAT THEY'RE GETTING FRUSTRATED ABOUT SOMETHINGNOW LOOK IF YOU'RE IN THE CONVERSATION A HUNDRED PERCENT YOU'RE GING TO GET FRUSTRATED TOO YOU'RE GN TO GET FRUSTRATEIT THE'RE FRUSTRATED NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A YOU'VE GOT AN EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT GOING ON WHERE'S IF YOU TAKE AN TAKE A MENTAL STEP BACK AND THEY WAITED WHY THEY FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW OH BECAUSE I'M TRYING TOS SOLVE THEY'RE PROBLEEN REALLY WHAT THEY'R OOKING TO DO AS VENT OK AK GOT IT LET HIM THAN O CANC HEL THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND TO SAYI WELL THAT'S THE PROB HERE'S WHAT YOUS SHOULD DO CAS PEOPLEARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THAT SO YEAV IT'S THIS THING THIS ABILITY IS AND IT'S SMETHING THAT CAN ABSOLUTELY BE TRAINED AND THAT'S WHAT'S COOL ABOUT IT CAN ABSOLUTELY BE TRAINED IT'S NOT A NATURAL GIFT IT'S IT'S SOME PEOPLE WE BETTER AT IT THAN OTHERS BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TRAIN I USED TO SEE GUYES DEVELOP AND I SEE PEOPLE DEVELOPIN NOW IN THE BUSINESS WORLD WHERE THEY'LL THEY'LL REPORT BACK TO ME YOU KNOW HAT WE HAD A MEETING WITH THE UNION TODAY AND THE UNION STARTED ESCOLATING WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO AND I JUST TO I DETACHED AND WE ENDED UP DESCLATING IN NOW WE GOT A SOLUTION SO THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE SKILLSET THAT CAN THAT CAN BE LEARNED AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ESPECIALLY NICE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE LOOK IF YOU'RE VERY ARTICULATE BORN VERY SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN MORE ARTICULATE THAN OTHER PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN WITH ANABILITY O SIMPLE FY THINGS MORE THAN OTHERS AND YOU CAN TRAIN AND YOU CAN BECOME MORE ARTICULATE YOU CAN BECOME YOU CAN LEARN TO SIMPLIFY THINGS MORE AND SOME PEOPLE CAN BE NATURALLY GOOD A DETACHING BUT BUT EVERY ONE CAN GET BETTER OUT AND THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING ITE'S A BEAUTIFUL THING AND I'M HIGHLY INSENSIF EYES TO DO THIS I MIN THEIR AREAS OF MY LIFE THEY'RE GOING REALLY WELL THAT I ALSO WANT TO APPLY IT THERE I THINK THAT I'VE TENDED TO RELY ON PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME AS A WAY TO ACCESS THIS DETACHMENT UM I WILL BE VERY DIRECT IN SAING THAT YOU KNW I AM NOT THE LEADER OF MY PODCAST THERE IS A LEADER IT IS NOT ME I'M PART OF THE TEAM BUT IT IS NOT ME AND I OFTEN RELY ON HIS IM PUT U AND SOMETIMES THAT IN PUT IS SOLICITED AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ONE PLACE FOR INSTANCE WHERE YOU SEE PEOPLE GETTING REALLY MYOPIC IS ON SOCIAL MEDIA I'D UM AND YOU KNOW AND I'VE EXPERIENCE THIS UM YOU ID LOVE TO SAY THAT'M ALWAYS NON REACTIVE AND I THINK IN GENERAL I TAKE THE STANDE THAT IAVE FILTERS SO I HAVE I'VE FILTERS I I KNOW WHY I'M THERE RIGHT 'M INTERESTED IN BEING A TEACHER AND A GIVER AND INFORMING PEOPLE AND ABOUT THE BEAUTY AND UTILITY O BIOLOGY THAT'S WHA I SAY I'S NOT A MISSION STATEMENTS IT'S A FACT THAT'S WHAT I CARE ABOUT ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T FIT THROUGH THAT FILTER I REALLY HAVE ANY BUSINESS DOING BUT OCCASION I LIKTA YOU NON'L MAKE A JOE KIRSEY BUT OCCASIONALY SOMETHING COMES THROUGHING YOU AND I FIND MYSELF AN WAY A SECOND AND YOU GET SUCKED INTO THAT TUNNEL AND SOMETIMES IT'S OBSERVING OTHER PEOPLE AN TUNNELS AND WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN THE TUNNEL IT'S SO OBVIOUS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT YOU'RE WATCHING IN SOME CASES PEOPLE JUST DRAGGING THEIR LIVES AND SOME CAY OS SINKING THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS I MEAN THE FORMER CHAIR OF PSYCHIETRIATE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK MADE IN ABSOLUTELY FOOLISH TRULY INSENSEITIVE TOTALLY IN APPROPRIATE TWEAT THAT'S MY OPINION AND I THINK IT WAS THE OPINION OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT FIRED HIM FROM HIS JOB THIS PERSON WAS AT THE TAPECS OF HIS CAREER LOST HIS JOB FOR SAYING SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND IN RETROSPECT WAS LIKE SAID SOMETHING LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING YOU KNOW AND SO DIS GUISE A PSYCHIATRIST SO IS THAT HE LIVES IN T IN THE STUDY IN THE TREATMENT OF THE MIND IT WAS JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT EVERYONE I THINK IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO BE IMPULLED INTO THESE TUNNELS AND FORTUNATELY EVERYONE IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO LEARNING TO TEACH THEMSELVES HOW TO RACH THEMSELVES OUT OF IT SO I LOVE THIS IDEA OF A TEACHABLE SKILL I'M CERTAINLY GOIN A PRACTICE IT IN ONE ON ONE AND IN GROUP SITUATIONS AND AND INA VARIETY OF SITUATIONS I I THINK THAT THE TUNNEL IS HAS A A GRAVITATIONAL PULL AS I CAN ALLURE TO THAT TUNNEL AND THAT I ALWAYS JUST GO RIGHT BACK TO THE NOR CHEMISTRY I THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SOLVING A PROBLEM INSIDE OF A TUNNEL LIKE AN ANIMAL ON A CHASE YOU KNOW BUT AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW THAT ANIMAL COULD GET PICKED OFF BY A YOU KNOW RUN OVER BY A TRUCK BECAUSE IT WAS DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SITUATIONAL WARENESS I'M DEFFLING IN A PRACTICES THROUGH OPENING THE GAZE YOU KNOW AND EMBROADENING GAZE AND I THINK I ALSO DO FOR A A COUPLE DAYS OFF FROM THINGS TO JUST WALK AND THINK ABOUT WORK ON THESE RETREATS DO PEOPLE WORK ON WORK OR THEY JUST THERE TO DO OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S WHERE THE IDEAS SURFACE WE'LL DO A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH SO WE'LL DO SOME STUFF THAT IS FOCASTRONG WORK BUT THEN WILL PULL OUT AND DOCE THINGS THATARE COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO WORK TO FOR THAT VERY REASON WHETHER WE DO SOMETHING PHYSICAL WHETHER WE DO SOMETHING SOME KIND OF A MENTAL EXERCISE BUT WE DO THINGS THAT ARE COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THEIR WORK AND AND TAKE THOSE BREAKS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FREE THEIR MIND YOU KNOW WHAT BOTHERS YOU MOUT SOPHOMEDIA THIS IS WILL YOU SAY THAT THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT KIND OF LIKE MAKE YOU MAB IT MEAN NOT ME BUT YOU KNOW COULD OF COURSE OF COURSE LIKE AMHUMAN OU KNOW LITTLE THINGS LITTLE THINGS TREATMENT IT'S NOT THE THINGS THAT ARE OBVIOUS IS ASTUALLY NOT DIRECT CRITIQUE OF ME IT'S AM IT'S WHEN PEOPLE EXPLOIT MISUNDERSTANDINGS TO TRY AND CREATE A GREATER MISUNDERSTANDING THAT DOESN'T EXIST THAT'S WHAT GETS ME CAUSE TO A SCIENTIST THAT'S LIKE THE MOST IRRITATING THING I DO'T KNO WHAT THE ANALEGY WOULD BE IN THE SEAL TEAMS BUT IT'S LIKE SOME ONE LIKE HIH JACKING SOMETHING THAT LIKE THEY DIDN'T MEAN THAT BUT THEN THEY COND OF THIY THEY DISTORT THE ARGUMENT THE WORD GASLIGTING GETS THROWN AROUND A LOT NOW LOT OF BE BLASHLLY THINK THAT ANY TIME SOMEONE STATES A BOUNDARY LIKE NOW I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S GASLYING TRUST ME THO PSYCHIATRICE WHO WERE ALL PROFESSIONALLY TREING TELL ME THAT IS NOT GASLIGHT GESS THING'S A VERY PARTICULAR THING WERE YOU I'M TRYING TO ALTER SOME ONE'S REALITY IN A VERY ACTIVE ALMOST LIKE SOCIAPATHIC WAY AM SO I JUST THAT'S A EDITORIALIZING RIGHT THERE WHAT BOTHERS ME IS WHEN PEOPLE A HIH JACK AM YOU KNOW SOME TIME SOME ONE IN A IN AN ARGUMENT ISN'T A SOPHISTICATED WITH THEIR LANGUAGE O SOMEBODY ELSE O SOME ONE WILL HIGH JACK THAT LACK OF SOPHISTICATION AND TRYING TO FLIP THEM ON THEIR BACK THAT SORT OF THIN NG REALLY GETS UNDER MY SKIN BECAUSE I FEEL THAT TREATES A UNNECESSARY DIVIDE UM THERE A FEW OTHER THINGS BUT YOU KNOW I I WAYS JOKIN MY LAB AND 'LL SARING AT AN I'VE THREE THOUSAND PEPIES BUT I 'LSE AVE LIKE THREE THOUSAND FLAWS TO MATCH EACH ONE OF THOSE HES YE I WHENEVER I'M IN THIS IS NOT JUST SOCIAL MEDIA BUT IT'S JUST LIFE YOU KNOW WHAN SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT ME YOURE TOO ME THAT I DON'T LIKE WHAT I REALIZED YEARS AGO IS I THE REASON I DON'T LIKE IS CAUSE THERE'S SOME TRUTH IN WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO SAY EITHER TO YOURSELF IF YOU'RE BY YOURSELF OR TO THEM IS TO SAY YO YU YE YET YEUN YOU'RE RIGHT I I AM KIND OF A KNOCKLAD SOMETIMES OR YE YOU'RE RIGHT I SOMETIMES YO JUMPED A CONCLUSION TOR YET Y YOU'RE RIGHT I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT THAT AND THAT IS JUST SO MUCH MORE LIBERATAT LIBERATING AND HEALTHY THEN SAYING YOU N KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OR KNOW I DON'T IT JUST GOING INTO THAT DEFENCIVE MODE AND AND TRYING TO CLOSE YOUR MIND AND SET O OPENG YOUR MIND UP TO LISTEN WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO SAY AND SA WHAT'S A GOOD POINT IM YOU'RE YOU'RE SPOT ON WITHOUT ONE NEXT QUESTION NEXT COMMADE LAT'S GO ONE THING I APPRECIATED ABOUT YOU ON SOCIA MEDYAS THE TE UM LIMITED NUMBER OF WORDS IN EACH OF YOUR RESPSTHATIT'S A GRATING AT FOR A SING YOU TO BE EFFICHENT AND CONCISE ICTUALLY S IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE IT ALSO FORCES YOU TO BE UM PRECISE AT LEAST ABOUT CATEGORY YOU'RE RIGHT I THING THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT WELL THERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE SO I WAS ON SOCIAL ON TWITTER THE OTHER DAY SINCE TWITTERS GETTING GETTING KIND OF GETTING A LOT OF GIN A LOT OF A TRACTION RIGHT NOW AS LOT OF MAYHAM GONE ON ITTHE OTHER HADON'T FT AND SOMEBODY ASKED ME SOMEBODY THAT HAM GOING TO BOOT CAMP SOON WHAT ADVICED YOU HAVE FOR ME AND I WROTE BACK ENJOY BON'T AND LIKE YOU SAID I MEAN IT'S TWITTER I'M RESPONDING TO BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE CHIMED IN AND SAID YOU DON'T MIGHT IS WELL NOT EVEN ANSWER JOCCO THAT'S NOT HELPING THI GY AT ALL ANT LOOK LITELY AT YOUR FACE FEAUSE YOU DON'T WANCHIN YOUR FACE JUST GOT A LITTLE BIT MAT RIGHT YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OFENSIVE FOR ME YIWELL I THINK THAT'S MY NATURE I DON'T LIKE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE SORT ATTACKD AN THING THAT'S LIKE MY NIGHT HAD A SPLIT SACKING OF WHO THE HELLS ISGY AND I SAID YOU NOWHAT HE'S RIGHT AND THEN I TWEAT IT AGAIN BACK THI US IT'S SORRY MAN YOU'RE RIGHT WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID WAS HEY READ THE BOOK LEADERSHIP STRAGETY IN TACTICS  IT'S A GOOD BOOK FOR SOME ONE THAT IS GOING TO BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S GOING O BE CHALLENGING AND WE'RE GING TO BE FACED WITH LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES AND ENJOY BOOT CAMP BECAUSE IF YOUR MIND SAID IS THIS IS SOCKS AND THIS IS TERRIBLE YOU'RE IT'S GOING TO BE TERRIBLE AND IT'S GON TO SOCK AND IF YOU GO WITH A MIND SAID OF HEY THIS IS A COOL EXPERIENCE AND I SHOULD ENJOY IT YOURE CAN HAVE A MUCH BETTER TIME THAT'S MY FULL ANCE SURE I'M STRITING TO AND IT'S PERFECTLY FINE LIKE THAT I WAS RIGHT TO CRUTIQUE ME AND HE WAS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT AND THERE AS A BUCH WHAT'SH FUNNY AS I PUNCH ALLTHER PEOPLE CAME TO MY DEFENCE I THISGUY THAT'S REALLY GREAND IT SO SO BUT MY POINT IS INSTEAD OF ME GETTING DEFENSIVE AND CRAZY AND LETTING IT TRI ME CRAZY OPEN MY MIND A LITTLE BIT LISTEN WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY EXCEPT THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME LEVEL OF TRUTH IN IT AND THERE WAS I GAVE A GUY A A VERY VERY TURSE RESPONSE AND I COULD AVE EXPANDED ONTO MORE AND I DID NOBODY GEAL GOOD TIMES I A FEW MINUTES AGO THINKING MYSELF WONDER WHERE YOUR MIND IS THAT LIKE IN THE FEW MOMENTS BEFORE YOU FALL ASLEEP LIKE ARE YOU ABLE TO MAKE YOURSELF GO MINE BLANK IM PRETTY EASILY IT' SOMETHING I'VE BEEN PRACTISING MORE BECAUSE I TEND TO AGAIN ROOM AND I LIKE TO DRILL INTO PROMS OBVIOUSLY YIT YESTERI DID A SOLA APOSODE WHICH WHEN WE DO THOSE ERE USUALLY ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TWENTY HOURS OF PRAB AND THEN THE RECORDINGS I WON'T SAY HOW LONG THEY TAKE BUT  BUT I LOVE GOING INTO THE TUNNEL RIGHTE THE TUNNEL IS LIKE THE THAT'S WHERE THE JUICE IS FOR ME AND FINDING THE STRUCTURE AND I HAVE THE BENEFIT OF AMAZING PRODUCER HELSE ME SORT THROUGH IT AND BUT A KIND LIE CAME OUT O THING AND THEN WHEN HOME COULDN'T EAT SOS I DO'T WANT DINNER AND THEN US EXPLAINING A CALL I HAD WITH A COLLY THE OTHER DAY AND YO MIG I SHE MIKE COFFRIN CHOSE JUS SLIKE YOUN LIKE I CAY LIKE I'M GOING TO SLEEP AND IWS LIKE UP AND LIK THINGIU TAXTAING LIKE THINKING WRITING NOTS OWN I THOUGHT A MAN LI 'M LIKE COSTELLO LIKE CHEWING ON THE STICK AND LIY THEY HEWIN INTO MY POT I NEEN'T I NEEDT SLEEP NEED TO GO TO SLEEP SO I THINK I'VE A A BIT OF A HARDER TIME DISENGAGING CLEARLY AAND I'M THIS IS WHY NEVER TOUCHED COCANOR INFED OF ME BECAUSE I THINK THAT SOME OF US HAVE A A LOVE OF THE DOPA MEAN CIRCUITRY THAT I ALWAYS SENSE IF I WERE TO HAVE TRIED DRUGS LIKE THAT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE UM THE THING THAT WOULD LIKE HIT MY NARRL CIRCUITS JUST RIGHT YOU'RE SOME DO TIME BUT I'LL CALL THAT WAY AVE READ BOOKS BY ALCOHOLICS LIKE THE OOK DRY AND FYEW OTHER UM RICHROLL TALKS ABOUT THIS THAT HE DRANK I'LL CALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CAUSU IT WAS LIKE THIS A LIXTUR THAT FILLED HIS BODY THAT MADE HIM FEEL RIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT'S NOT HOW I FEEL AFTER A COUPLE OF JINGSTHAT IT ALL O RELAXED BUT I CAD DO WITHOUT IT BUT THIS DRILLING INTO SOMETHING IS REALLY THAT'S MY UM I GUESS MAY BE THAT'S MI I DON'T THINK ITS THE SUPERPOWER BUT I HAVE SOME SOME STRENGTH THERE BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO THE THING THAT CUT THAT CAN CUT ON THE OTHER SIDE YOUN YOU STARTED OFF THIS CONVERSATION EARLY YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU'R GETTING UP IN THE MORNING NDO YOU  GET UP AND YOU HAVE THESE NOULS ABOUT TO GO DOWN THE PATH OF LIKE IT'S AT NIGHT TIME WHEN I'M TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP AND I HAVE SOME RANDOM THOUGHT ABOUT SOME THING THAT THAT CAN BE A HARD FOR I HAVE A A VISUAL THING THAT'S GOINE ON IT SEEMS IKE COME ON A ROLAR COASTER AND I'M GOING IN LIKE A NEW IDEA COMES IN I'M JUST LIKE ON THIS AWSUM RIDE AND I GET'S NOCK AN STOP AND I CAN'T I DON'T NO HOW TO STOP THAT  OH NO I BEEN I THINK IT IT GOES WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY DRIVEN AND AND LIKE TO MASTER DIFFERENT CRAFTS I HAVE A COLLEAGUE IS NAMEIS CARLDICE SEROUT THES BYO ENGINEERI AS FIVE CHILDREN AND HE'S A PSYCHATRAS HE'S LIKE AN INCREDIT LIKE ONE THESE PEOPLE I DOES A TAUN VERY LIKELY WILL WIN THE NOBLE PRIZE HOM ME'S AN AMAZING SCIENTISTS AMAZING GI AND HE DOES THIS PRACTICE THAT HE DOES IS NOT A MEDITATION WHICH HE SITS FOR AN HOUR LATE AT NIGHT AFTER HIS KIDS A GONE TO SLEEP AND HE FORCES HIMSELF FORCES HIMSELF TO THINK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES WITH PUNCTUATION ABOUT SOME PROBLEM I TRIED DOING THAT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND AND I FELL OFF BUT IT'S A SOMETHING THAT HE'S CULTIVATED AND HIMSELF WHICH HELPS HIM IN HIS CAREER RIGHT I DON'T THINK THATS THIS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING I RECKOMMEND IF I DID THAT AT ONE OR TWO IN THE MORNING I KNOWBE BAD FOR MY SLEEP BECAUSE FALLING ASLEEP ASHER REQUIRES DRIFTING INTO THESE KIND OF LIMINAL STATES SO ON OTHER REASONS WHY I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF THINGS LIKE NON SLEEP DEEP REAST T OR THESE YOGAN NEEDRO PRACTICES WHICH ARE BASELY BODY SKANS WERE YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN TO DETACH FROM THE SENSORY WORLD UM AND THEI'RE VERY EFFECTIVE IT A IT CERTAINLY FOR ME THEY'VE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT TEACHING ME TO HAVE TURN OFF THINKING WHICH IS A INTERESTING NOTION IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT I LIKE THE IDEA OF OF DETACHMENT BY STEPPING BACK AND GETTING PERSPECTIVE MY MY FATHER IS MUCH BETTER AT THAT HE'S A VERY CALM GUY AND IN THE WORLD OF CONFRONTATION I ALWAYS KNEW WHENE ELLS A KID HE WOULD BLANK WHICH YE MENT LIKE SOME WAS GING A HAPN LIKE IL WAS GOIN TO GET IT AND UM NOW BUT I'VE ALWAYS DOES HE CAN CONTROL HIS HIS RESPONSES HIS BEHAVIOR UM OTHERS OF US IN THE FAMILY YOU KNOW THE SIDE FROM NEW JERSEY WERE MORE LIKE GO TO LOGER HEADS SII DON'T KNOW THIS RAISE IS A QUESTION I THINK IT'S A ONE THAT I AND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE I TALK TO HIN ANTICIPATION IS FODCASTS WERE ASKING YOU MI THINK ONE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEN IN THE SEAL TEAMS UM AND YOU IN PARTICULAR ARE THAT I THINK EVERYBODY NOT JUST MALES BUT FEMALES TO I THINK EVERYBODY AND WANTS TO KNOW LIKE THEIRE CALIBRATION POINT ON THEIR LEVEL OF TOUGHNESS I THINK PEOPLE WONDER YOU KNO I THINK WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BUDS AND ALL THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEELE WONDER WOULD I MAKE IT THROUGH I I'VE CERTAINLY WONDERED AT I'VEN'T SPEND HOURS ON IT I WENT MY PATH I'M HAPPY FOR THE PATH I WENT UM BUT I THINK PEOPLE WONDER LIKE DO I HAVE THIS THING THAT SUPPOSEDLY BUDS SELECTS FOR AND IF I DON'T AT HOW TOUGH AM I OR NOT TOUGH AM I I THNK THAT WE ALL CAN LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLEPHYSICALLY AND I'M NOT SOMEBODY THAT DOES A LOT OF THIS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY OBSESS BY THIS LIKE ALL THAT PERSON HAT LIKE AN AIN'T PACK WITH A LIKE VAINS LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT ME BUT I UNDERSTAND SOME POPLE DO THAT EVEN TO THE POINT OF MYTHOLOGY BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WONDER HOW RESILIENT AM I HWAND THEY CAN LOOK TO EXPERIENCES THAT THEY'VE SURVIVED AND SAY I MADE IT THROUGH WERE I' RESILLIN TOR NOT BUT IS THERE A WAY THAT A WE CAN I CERTAINLY THAT WE CAN TRAIN IT BY DOING HARD THINGS COLD SHOWERS HIS KINDING ARE LIKE SMALL EXAMPLES OF THOSE BUT D OU THINK IT'S AN EVEN AN IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK AND IF IT IS YOU KNOW HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT THINKING LIKE WERE WEAR IT LIKE HOW RAZILIENT AMA SHOULD WE PUT OURSELF INTO SITUATIONS OF DISCOMFORT JUST TO TEST THAT AS I WILL SAY I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK TO STEAL TEAMS AND TINGUIS IN PARTICULAR AS HAVE A A A CALIBRATION POINT LIKE UGET THEY KNOW HOW TO DO HARD THINGS AT THEY WERE SELECTED FOR THE ABILITY TO CARRY LOGS AND GETTING A COLD WATER OVER AND OVER AND ROLL IN THE SAND AND GO WITHOUT SLEEP FOR A WEEK OR SO LIKE BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WHEN THEY WERE ON DEMPLOYMENTS IT'S CLEARLY A PRESSURE TAST FOR SOMETHING ELSE YET IT'S A STRANGE STRANGE THING THE BASIC UNDERWATER DEMOLITION SEAL TRAINING AND QUITE FRANKLY GOING AND GETTIN WET AND COLD AND BEING MISERABLE IS IS ACTUALLY NOTHING A COMPARED TO LIKE BEING ON DEPLOYMENT AND A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT I USE TO COMPARE THIS TO IS A WHEN I WAS ON DEPLOYNMENT AND TWO THOUSAND SIX IN REMODI THERE WAS A AS YOU WERE AS YOU WERE DRIVING OFF BASE TO GO TO THE CITY TO GO INTO THE CITY AN CONDUCT OPERATIONS AS YOU DROVE OUT OF THE COMPOUND ON YOUR RIGHT WAS THIS AREA THAT WAS CALLED THE VEHICLE GRAVEYARD IN THE VEHICLE GRAVEYARD WAS EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS PROBABLY SEVENTY FIVE OR A HUNDRED VEHICLES THAT WERE BLOWN UP DESTROYED BURNED AM IN VERIOUS TWISTED CONDITIONS THAT HAD BEEN DRAGGED BACK THROUGH THE CITY AND PUT INTO THIS VEHICLE GRAVEYARD AND AS YOU DROVE BY THAT VEHICLE GRAVEYARD YOU KNOW WITHOUT QUESTION THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE TWISTED VEHICLES REPRESENTED ONE TO THREE FOR FIVE AMERICAN CASUALTIES WOUNDED HORRIBLY WOUNDED KILLED IN THERE YOU ARE IN VEHICLE ABOUT TO ROLL OUT INTO THAT CITY WHERE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT CAN EASILY BE YOU IN THE NEXT THREE MINUTES AND YOU'R GING TO DO THAT TO DAY YOU CAN DO THAT TOMORROW YOU DO THAT THE NEXT DAY IN THE DAY AFTER THAT IN THE DAY AFTER THAT THAT COMPARED TO AND BY THE WAY THIS ISN'T JOUS SEALS THAT ARE DOING THAT THIS IS MARINSIS IS THE ARMY GUISAR OVER THERE THIS IS WHAT EVERY ONE IS DOING AND THEY DO IT THEY DO IT UM YOUS I TALK ABOUT MARKLEY USE ONE OF MY GUIS FIRT SEAL KILLED IN MY RACKAN HERE WAS THE LEAD TURRIT GUNNER IN THE LEAD HUMVY AND LIKE CAN FEE IT N OM IF YOU WERE THE POINT MAN OF YET NOMF YOURE UP L AN INFANTRY PATROL YOU APPOINTMAN OF GET O'M YOUR AT RISK BUBY TRAPS AMBUSH SO THEY ROTATED YOU OUT YOUN ENOUGH TO STAY UP THERE ALL ALL THE TIME YOUD DO AN HOUR UP WITH THE AS POINTMAN TO GET SOME ONE ELSE UP THERE AND THAT GUY THE LEED TURRET GUNNER IN THE IN A HUMVY COLUM OF FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX VEHICLES F YOU HIT AN IETE THAT'S THE VEHICLE IT'S CAN HIT IT IGHT IF YOU CULD GOINTO AN AMBUSH THAT'S THE GUYD THAT'S ON TO TO HITS THE GUY THAT'S STANDING UP IN A FIFTY CALIBER TURRET THAT'S THE GUYD THAT'S GON TO DIE ND MARK WAS IT YOU NOT US A NEW GU SO HE'S HE'S IN THAT LEAD TURRET FIFTY COW AND HE NEVER ASKED TO GET ROTATED OUT AND I'M HOIS A VERY LIKE TO SAY VERY HE WAS EXTREMELY CARISMATIC FUNNY GREGARIOUS A COMMEDIENT AND YOU WE GOT ALL KINDS OF STORIES ABOUT MARK BUT ONE OF EM OU A WEWERE IN VAGUUS AND WE'RE ALL GAMBLING AND LIKE I COME DOWN FROM MY HOTEL ROOM AN LIKE I SEE MARK ACROSS THE ACROSS THE HE'S PLAYIN BACK JACK AND WE SEES ME EGLES HAY SIR WHEN OR THE NEW CATLACKS COMING OUT LIKE HE'S JUST BLIGHTEN UP EVERYBODY IM JUST HAVING A FANTASTIC TIME BUT IEMEMER ONE NIGHT YO KNOW HE'S GETING READY TO ROLL OUT AND IF

KNOW LIKE THAT WAS HIS ATTITUDE AND HE'S A GUYDIS GAN TA DRY BY THAT VEHICLE GRAVEYARD DRIVE RIGHT OUT ON THAT CITY ND HE'S CAN DO THE NEXT DAY IN THE DAY AFTER THAT ON THE DAY AFTER THAT SO AND AND LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHAT THE ARMY GUYS ARE DOING THAT'SWHAT THE RINCORGUIS ARE DOING THEY'RE DOING IT AND SO AS MUCH AS THE MITHOLOGY AROUND BASIC SEAL TRAINING GOES UM TO ME THAT'S THAT THAT THAT EXPERIENCEIN COMBAT AND WHAT GUYS DO IS INFINITELY HARDER AND INFILLY MORE IMPORTANT UM NOW ALL THAT BEING SAID BASC SEAL TRAINING AS I ISIT IS THE IS A VERY STRANGE LABORATORY FOR HUMAN BEINGS IT IS A VERY STRANGE LABORATORY FOR HUMAN BEINGS AND IT'S AID H I IT'S IT'S KIND OF CRAZY THE WAY IT WORKS IT'S VERY IT'S IT'S OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUT THERE'S NO LIKE O I WOULDN'T PUT MONEY YOU COULD PUT ODDS ON SOMEBODY MAKING IT THROUGH YOU KNOW LIKE HAY THAT GUY SEEMS LIKE SOME BE GOOD TO GO BUT I WOULDN'T PUT A BUNCH OF MONEY ON IT I AND I WOULDN'T TAKE LIKE A HUNDRED PER CENT I WOULDN'T NEVER TAKE HON TO PRESENT BAT ON ANYBODY CAUSE THE'S NO ONE THAT'S HONOR PRESENTT GING TO MAKE IT TROUGH THAT TRAINING AND THERE'S THERE'S JUST BRAND M YOURE SOME PEOPLE SEE IT'S WALT IT'S CAUSE YOUR WIFE THERE'S PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT THOUR SHEEL TRAINING CAUSE THEI'RE EXCRL FRIEND SAID THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT THERE'S SOME OTHER GUY THAT MAKES IT THROUGH BECAUSE THEY PROMISED GOD THAT THEY WOULD MAKE IT THERE'S SOME OTHER GUY THAT MAKE IT THROUGH BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE'RE DAD SAID THEY CON NAV THERE'S LIKE EVERY ONE THES EXAMPLES YOUCAN COME UP WITH AND AND IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR SOME RANDOM DO TO MAKE IT THROUGH AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR PEDIGRE IS DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM THERE'S GUISES FROM IOWA THERE'S GUYSES FROM FLORIDA THERE'S GUIE FROM WHEREVER THAT MAKE IT AND THERE'S GUYS FROM MY WHEN THERE'S GUS FRM FLORDA THER'S GUIS FROM WHEREVER THEY DON'T MAKE IT GEUIS FROM FARMS GUSE FROM SILVER SPOON IN THEIR MOUTH AND YOU JUST CAN'T PREDICT IT AND I I MEAN TO HAS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT HOW BAD YOU ACTUALLY WANTO DO IT THAT'S IT'S IT'S A STRANGE THING AND I WOULDN'T YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T TRY IN YOU OF I WAS IN THE WORLD IF I DIDN'T DO THAT TRAINING I WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO FORGOT IF I COULD MAKE OERE NOT CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW TYOU DON'T KNOW THE VERY STRANGE THING AND IT'S AND IT'S SO MYTHICAL ALMOST RIGHT NOW RIGHT IT'S MYTHICAL THAT HOW HARD IT IS AND IS NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE MAKE IT THROUGH MAN ITS FIFTEEN PER CENT YE NOW YOU HAVE FROM ALL THE FOLKS THAT I'VE TALK TO THERE GONE THROUGH BEEN INSTRUCTOR'S THERE SOME WE BOTH KNOW IM SEEM THAT THAT FIFTEEN PER CENT NUMBER IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE AS LONG AS THEY KEEP THE THE PROCESS THE SAME THAT JUST SEEMS AT ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM THAT CAN PERHAPS GROW DURING THAT TRAINING BUT THAT THIS IT IS BEING IDENTIFIED AND SELECT IT FOR RATHER THAN SOMEHOW BEING BUILT UP ACROSS AT LEAST THAT FASE THE EARLY PHASES OF TRAINING AND THEN AT SOME POINT THEY BUILD ON THAT CAPACITY AND YOU KNOW THIS GETS TO THIS REALLY SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE FRANKLY LIKE ARE PEOPLE WIRE DIFFERENTLY AND LISTEN IE STARTED OFF IN NURAL DEVELOPMENT AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE SOME UNIVERSAL PROPERTIES IF OF NURAL DEVELOPMENT IN ALL SURVIVING HUMAN LIKE THAT YOURE GING TO BREATHE WITHOUT HAVING TOTHINK ABOUT AT YOUR HARTS CAN BE WITHOUT HAVING TA THINK ABOUT IT BUT BEYOND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION AND NATURAL LEVELS OF DOPENING AND CERETONE AND UM I STHERE'S NATURE PLAYS A POWERFUL ROLE AND NURTURE AND WHAT'S INTERESTING THOUGH AS WE CAN'T ALWAYS PREDICT FROM PARENTS WHAT NATURE IS GOING TO DO RECENTLY WE HAD SOONE ON THE PODCASTS I N THE CIDE FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO IT IF IF I PERHAPS YOU WILL IF I CEND IT TO YOU IS A TI'VE TALKS ABOUT INHERITABLE ACQUIRED TRAITS YOU DON'T EXPECT THT BECAUSE YOU WORK OUT THAT YOUR GRAND KIDS WILL BE MORE MUSCULAR AND HAVE BETTER ENDURANCE BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME EVIDENCE THAT THAT MAY BE THE CASE AND YU KNOL HOW COULD THAT BE WE GOT TWO KINDS OF SELLS IN YOUR BODY IT TURNS OUT YOUAVE WHAT CALL SEMMATIC CELLS WHICH ARE ALVENLN OF THE GERM CELLS WHICH ARE YOUR SPERM AND YOUR WIFE'S EGGS WELL WHY WOULDN'T THE DEANA OF THE SPERM CELLS IN THE EXCELLS BE MODIFIABLE BY EXPERIENCE IF ALL THE OTHER CELLS AREN'N IT TURNS OUT THERE SOME EVIDENCE THAT NAMEIT'S NOT THE DEANA BUT THAT THE ARE INA ARE THINK ABOUT THAT THAT MEANS THAT WHETHER AND WE KNOWN THIS THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN IN A FAMINE SEVERAL GENERATIONS LATER THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR BLOODSHRUT OF REGULATION IN THEIR GREAT GRAND HITS SO THE IDEA THAT EXPERIENCE AND ACQUIRED TRAITS CAN CHANGE US AS ACTUALLY HAS SOME VALIDITY AN NO YOU KNOW AND AND IT AND THIS GETS INTO REALLY COMPLICATE THINGS TAT BE WELL THIS IS LIKE THE DRAFT T HEAD TOLIKES CRAIN IT'S NECK AND THEN GETE BIRTH TO LONGER NECTURE HAVSENCE LIKE WILL NOT EXACTLY BUT ALSO NOT ENTIRELY UNTRUE EITHER SO I LOVE THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE INHERITED TRAITS AND THAT THERE ARE THAT NATURE AND NURTURE PLAY AROLE BUT THAT HARD WORK MAY ACTUALLY TRANSMIT ACROSS GENERATIONS THE OTHERE'S IN SEAL TRAINING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE KID'S THAT COME THROUGH THAT THAT CALL LEGACIES WHICH MEANS THAT THEY HAVE A DAD I THINK IT I DAD BROTHER WHATEVER AND THEY DO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF MAKING IT BUT IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE CHANCE AT ALL AN IT REAT MY PERSONAL PITIN IS LIKE I THINK A LEGACY KID WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF MA IT JUST DO TO THE THANKSGIVING DINNER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AIF YOU DON'T YET IF YOU'RE EVEN INVITED WHICH YOU MIGHT BE ON YOUR OWN A BUT YET TIT SO THAT THERE'S MAY BE THERE SOMETHING THROUGH THAT AS WELL BUT I THINK THAT'S JUST MORE THE THE PRESSURE THAT SOME ONE MUST FEEL LIKE HAY THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO BE ALLOWED BACK IN MY HOME IF I DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH THIS TRAINING SO OCAN HAVE TO JISGO HAD AND SUCK IT UP BUT NOT EVERYONE MAKES IT AND IM IT'S IT'S A BUMMER  WHEN THAT WHEN THAT DOES OCCUR WELL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT GOING THROUGH SEAL TRAINING OR WHO MISS THE OPPORTUNITY OR WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON DO YOU THINK THERE'S VALUE TO DOING THINGS EACH DAY THAT SUCK A LITTLE BIT OR FROM TIME TIME DOING SOMETHING THAT'S YOU DON'T PUTS ONE END TO A STATE OF DELIBERATE A DISCOMEFOR HUNDR PERCENT I MEAN HUNDR PERCENT I MEAN EVEN YOU IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOURSELF YOUVE GOT A YOU GOT A IMPOSE SOME DISCIPLIINESELF RIGHT IF IF YOU WANT TO GET STRONGER YOU'VE GOT A DO THINGS THAT REQUIRE STRENGTH IF YOU WANT A BETOFF FOR YOU GOT A DO THINGS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO BE TOUGHER I THINK THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT PORT DOES THAT MEAN DOING THINGS THAT ARE NOT PLEASURABLE SO FOR INSTANCE IM YOU NAVE DONE SOME LONG PODCASTS AND NA A FEW WEEKS AGO IDEA A SERIES WE WERE DOING A SERIES O ANY GALLOPIN O ALL THAT EXERCISE AND EXERCISECISE AND WE DID SIX PODCASTS IN THAT WE MUST HAVE EVER DONE WHICH MAY DOING FOR OR FIVE THE NEXT WEEK NOT SO BAD BUT I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT AND I LOVE EVERY SECOND OF PODCASTING AND SO IT DIDN'T SUCK BUT IT BUILTS UP A GREATER CAPASTITY IGESS I'M ASKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THINGS THAT REALLY FEEL LIKE A SPLINTER IS THERE ANY VALUE TO THAT IM BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE I KNOW SOME OF THEM ARE FORMER TEAM G THE ART TEAM GUISES HE DON'T SAY FORMITY MAS IT THEY WERE UM OUT THEY'RE OUT OF THE TEAMS NOW BUT THEY'RE TEAM GIS FOR EVER WHO SEEM TO NOT BE RATTLED BY LITTLE THINGS THOSE GUYSE IN PARTICULAR THEY THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE RATTLE BY LITTLE THINGS THEN I KNOW PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THEY UM THEY GET THE WRONG SIZED COFFEE TO COFSHOP AND THEY DISSOLVE INTO A PUDDLE OF FEERS SO THERE DOEST SEEM TO BE SOMETHING TO THIS HULL LIKE MENTAL RAZILIENTS THING AND FLEXIBILITY THING U AND I I TRY AND DO SOMETHING THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE UM TO ME ABOUT ONCE A WEEK SOME THE E REALLY DON'T LIKE UM IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THAT IS BUT I TRY AND DO SOMETHING THAT' SOUND LIKE UNPLEASANT UM OR DO SOMETHING IN A WAY THAT'S UNPLEASANT GUESS THE EXAMPLE  GETTING INTO THE COLD WATER THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND MAKING THAT DECISION FROM UNDER THE BLANKET'S IS A ROUGH ONE FOR ME UM BUT THEN IT GETS EASIER AND THEN YOU WONDER IS IT STILL SERVING THE PURPOSE THAT IT'S BUILDING ME UP SO SHOULD PEOPLE SEEK TRULY LIKE BAD EXPERIENCE IS PROVIDED THAT THEY'RE DONE IN A SAFE WAY I THINK THAT YOUR GOING O JUST LIKE YOU WOULD DEVELOP YOUR LEGS BY DOING SQUOTS AND YOU WOULD DEVELOP YOURVBACK BY DOING PULLOPS I THINK YOU WOULD DEVELOP YOUR RAZILIENCY BY DOING REPETITIONS OF THINGS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO BE TOUGHER THAT ACTUALOQUET GOOD TOIT THEND THE REASON I ASK TIS IS BECAUSE I THING A LOT OF YOU'LL THINK W I WORK OUT EVERY DAY BUT I BUT THEN YOU PROVE THEM ALLOPEN TE'RE LIKE BUT I LOVE EXERCISE AND THE WELL THEN THAT DOESN'T QUITE QUALIFY AS SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU TOUGHER RIGHT OR THEY THINK O THE LAST RAPS OF A SET ARE REALLY TOUGH BUT IF YOU LOVE HITTING FAILURE ON A SET CAUSE THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I SEEK IN THE GIM I LOVE THAT ASPECT OF THE TRAINING THAT'S I SO WHERE I KNOW I'M GETTING BETTER IT NO LONGER SERVICES RAZILIENT TRAINING IT MORGIS SERVICE AS TRAINING UM N YES I THINK THAT THE POINT IS CLEAR AND APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT SOMETHING THIS IS CAN A SEEM LIKE A A TOTAL DIVERGENCE BUT IT'S NOT WHICH IS ANIMALS TBECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE A LOVE OF MINE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE ANIMAL KINGDOM IND PLACING HUMANS INTO THE ANIMAL KINGDOM SECOND WHALL I KNOW YOU'RE A HUNTER UM AND ALSO I KNOW YOU OWN DOGS AND THE QUESTION I HAVE IS DO YOU EVER LOOK AT PEOPLE OR DID YOU EVER WORK IN TEAMS OF OF GUYSE WHEN YOU'RE ON ACTIVE DUTY GAVE SEE THAT THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU NAW YOU MENTION BEFORE THIS PERSONS REALLY GET A PROBLEMS ALL IN THIS PERSONS A LITTLE BIT MORE UM CREATIVE YOEVER WONDER WHETHER NOT PEOPLE  OF EMBODY DIFFERENT ON OF ANIMAL ARCHETYPES THAS I DO WELL THAT THAT THING WHERE PEOPLE SAY THAT DOGS OR OWNERS LOOK LIKE THEIR DOGS DOGS WIN REN YOUR OWNERS I THINK THAT'S I'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF ICYOUAN GOIN INTER DAT AND FIND A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES OF DOGS THAT LOOK LIKE THEIR OWNERS AND OWNERS THAT LOOK LIKE THEIR DOGS SO I THINK THAT'S TRUE AND I THINK AH YOU DON'T BY MY DOGS ARE WSOM AND DON'T TELL ME ABOUT YOU'RE DONG WISNONDOGS MY DOGS AE GERMAN SHEPERD IS NAME IS ODEN AND HE'S UNALSOME DOG YOUE NOWLIKE AM AND HESHE'S GOT A PERSONALG GUTS O EASY IT GOT AN INTERESTING PERSONALITY SO LIKE HE DOESN'T LIKE TO A LIKE CUDDLE RIGHT LIKE MY KIDS  WE LI GO WE DOESN'T LIKE TO CUDDLE NOW EVEN YOU KNOW WHEN WE GO TO BED AT NIGHT HE GOES TO YOUR FOUR FEET AWAY FROM THE FOOT OF MY BED EVEN IF ILES LIKE HATE JUMP UP OU 'VE TOLD HIM JUMP UP IN HERE YOU KNOW WE WANT O PET YOU HE'LL JUMP UP IN THERE AND HE JUST LIKE KIND OT GOES IN THAT LOW CROUCH POSITION AND THEN SORT OF WAITS UNTIL I SAY FREE DOG AND THEN HE GOES BACK DOWN HE GOES FOR FEET AWAY FRM THE FOOT THE BED IND SIT TERE CAUSE HE'S THAT'S HIS THAT'S HIS PERSONALITY IS TWO PROTECT AND SAT SECURITY AND DO HIS JOB AND AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S LIKE AND SO YOU KNOWN YOU'VE GOT OTHER DOGS THAT ARE YOO THITHEY NOT IT THEY'RE TO TILLY DIFFERENT MINDS THAT SO YHE HAVE DOGS HAVE DEFINITE PERSONALITIES AND AND LOOK I ALSO HAVE AIT IT'S NOT ALLGENETIC SO TWO OF MY FRIENDS A GOT DOGS THAT WERE BROTHERS WHEN THEY CALLED DO GO ARGENTINOS YOU KNOW WHAT IS OGAS THE OTHERS ARE HARD TO GET IN YOU ASK THERE NOT AND IT IT MAG NOT EVEN BE LEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES SO DON'T TELL ME O THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT THAT I CARE BUT I LIKE LAYOU WHERE THEY ARE YET BUT THESE TWO GUYS AND THOSE TWO GUYS HAD DIFFERENT PERSONLITIES B ONE GUY IS VERY HAPPY GLUCKY LIKE TO SMOKE POT LIKES TO HANG OUT VERY JUST THE CHILL KIND O PLAYFUL GUY THE OTHER GUYS NOT HES THE OPPOSITE IN EVERY CATEGORY SO AND THEY BOTH GOT THESE DOGS AND YOU FAST FORIT FAST FORD LIKE A YEAR THE DOG THAT WAS OWNED BY THE PLAYFUL GUY HIS DOG WAS JUST A BIG PUPPY LAKIN A YOU KNOW JUS WAGIN THE TAIL THE OTHER DOG YOU HAD TO KEEP IT IN A CAGE OR IT WOULD MURDER EVERYTHING INSIGHT AND IND THESE DOGS WERE BROTHERS FROM THE SAME LITTER AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY OPPOSITE AND SO I THINK IT HAS MORE ALOT MORE TO DO WIH WITH NURTURE THEN IT DOES TO DO WITH NATURE BUT THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOULS I MEAN MOUTS HAVE A PERSONALITY THAT IS VERY DISTINCT COMPARED TO A GERMAN SHEPHERD NOW LOOK THERE'S OUTLYING MOUTHS THERE'S OUTLYING GERMAN SHEPHERDS THERE'S OUTLYING WHAT YOU KNOW YOU NAME WHATEVER KIND OF GOLDEN RETRIEVER WHATEVER DOG IS KNOWN FOR BEING MORE PLAYFUL LIKE YOU YOU GET AROUND THE MUTH MOTHS AR MOUS ARE MOUTHS AND THEY'RE THAT W IF YOU BEEN AROUND MUTHS BEFORE O OH O THE BELGIAN MOU YI A FEW OF EM THATMY NEIGHBOR HAS ONE AND THAT THING UM THUT IS NOT TERRIBLY FRIENDLY BUT IT'S IT'S A SECURITY DOGS I DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE DOS THEM YET THET THE'RE I KNOW THE THEY USE HIM FOR WORK IN THE TEAMS AND I'VE HEARD THAT YOU HOUVHT TO KEEP A CLOSE I ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM ECAUSE IF YOU GET LACXS ABOUT IT THEY'LL BITE YOU THE THAT TRUE THE FIRST TIME I SAW ONE A WE WERE DOING LIKE A A DRILL WITH USING DOGS FOR THE FIRST TIME INTH ONE OF THE TEAMGO DOG HANDERS CAME OUT AND SO WE HIT THIS TARGET BUILDING AND YOU KNOW T THETHET KIND OF PREBRIEF DO A HA GET THIS TARGET BUILDING AND THIS GUIES CAN BE A RUNNER O SQUIRGER AND AND SO THE WE PULL UP IN THE HUMVIES ASALTIN JUMPS OUT I'M KIND OF  STAYIN EXTERNAL CON O CON ONE SEE HIT'S CAN HAPPEN SO THE SQUARDER GOES RUNNING OFF AND THE DOG HANDLER LIKE WHATEVER TRACKS HIS DOG ON THIS GUY AND THEN RELEASEIS IT GIVES HIM WHATEVER COMMANDS YOU KNOW HOWUT WHATEVER THE COMMANDS ARE THAT THING IS LIKE TOLDLY PRIMED LIKE AIN'T UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN YOUR LIFE IT IS JUST CRIME ETS TRACKIN THAT GUY HE HITS THAT RELEASE ON THAT LEASH AND THAT THING TAKES OFF AT A THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR IT JUMPS LIKE I'M NOT KITTING FIFTEEN FEET MAYBE TEN FEET IN THE AIR AWAY AND YUST CHOMPS ON TO THIS DUE TO DUTE GOES DOWN IT WAS FREEKING ALL I'VE SEEN SOVIDIOS TAS A MALINOIS I GUESS I DIDN'TFOR FORGEVING HAS BEFRI TON KNW YOUR FRIENDSHIP BUT MAUTHS MAT A BELGIAM MALNOIS THOSE DOS LIKE RUNNING UP TREE JUMPING OVER LITTLE LO RIVERS IOUT THA IT'S CRAESY INCREDIBLY POWERFUL ANIMALS YE WELL THE IDEA THAT PEP YOU KNOW THAT THEY MIMIC THEIR OWNERS HAS ME ILLITT CONCERNING AS MY LAST DOG HAD TO PUT HIM DOWN AS MY BULL DOG COSTOLS A BULL DOG MASTIFF I GOT HIM BECAUSE I WENT TO PICK OUT A POPPY BASICALLY AND THERE WARE AID OF THESE BULL DOGS ALL TEM RUNNING AROUND AND THEN THERE'S ONE IN THE BACKGROUND JUS EATING OUT OF ALL OF THEIR BOWLS AND I'LS LIKE I ON THAT ONE YOU KNOW HIG BULL DOG BIGGEST ONE IN THE LITTER LAZIEST CREATURE NOT JIS DOG THE LAZIEST CREATURE THAT EVER EXISTED BUT IF YOU NEED TO ACTIV EIGHT HE WOULD HE WAS JUST VERY EFFICIENT WITH HIS ENERGY ANYNOW I DON'T THINK I HAVE A BULL DOG PERSONALITY AND THAT'S WHY GOUTUM TO GON BALANCE ME OUT YOU KNOW IM NEVER RETRIEVED NEVER DID ANYTHING A STOLE AND DESTROYED EVERY TOY AT EVERY DOG PARK IN SANDIAGO WHO'S KONT OF FAMOUS THERE YOU KNOW I HAD TO BRING AFIVE DOLLAR BILLS TO PAY PEOPLE FOR ALL THE BALLS AND THINGS HE WOULD DESTROY SO AND WHEN MY APOLOGIES TOLD THE DOG OWNERS NOT REALLY I AM MISS HIM DID YOU TRAIN YOUR DOG OR DID SOME HEN ELSEON EUSE I DI IT WAS HE TRAIN TO BE A SECURITY DOG OR A CONT OF FAMILY DOG OR IT US CON OF A MIXTURE YOU N I MEAN THE TRUE WORKING DOGS UM UNLESS YOU UNLESS YOU HAVE THE TIME AND EFFORTO PUT IN TO HIM OR YOU BUY HIM THAT WAY A YOUYOU DON'T LIKE YOU DON'T WANT ONE OF THOSE DOGS THAT I WESE JUST DESCRIBING IN YOUR HOUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT FOR A HOUSE UM UNLESS THERE'S LIKE THERE'S THAT LEVEL MY DOGS NOT THAT LEVEL A HE'S ALSOME DID YOU APPLY SOME OF THE SAME A PRINCIPLES THAT YOU USEIN A LEADERSHIP OF HUMANS WITH YOUR DOG YE THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILAR PRINCIPLES BUT THERE'S ALSO YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE SOME DIFFERENCEAS THERES LIKE THE'RE THE'RE THEIR PACK ANIMALS RIGHT AND THEY RESPOND TO YOU KNON THTHE PACK LEADER IS FANTO YOU KNOW MY MY DOG OBEYS ME AS IF IT'S THE COMMAND OF GOD AND MY WIFE HE'S KIND OF LIKE MAYBE I'LL DO WHAT YOU SAY SO THE THEY KICK UP ON THAKATASTOV DOGS ARE VERY INTUITIVE I LOVE THIS IDEA THAT I'V TOLD EARLY ON THAT THEY CAN FEEL YOUR EMOTIONS I THINK THEY ACTUALLY CAN SENSE HOW WE FEEL NOT JUST BY THE INTONATION OF OUR VOICE BUT I HOPE SOME DAY SOME ONE WILL FIGURE OUT IN ANONEVASESIVE WAKE AS ON LIKE THE IDEA OF PEOPLE DOING EXPERIMENTS ON DOGS IN INVASIVE WAY CON'T LIKE WHAT THEY'RE PICKING UP ON LIKE FRINCES WE KNOW THAT SHARKS ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY IN THE LATERAL LINE OF FISH AT LOT FISH HAVE THESE UM THESE STRETCHES OF NER ONS THEY CALL THE LATERAL LINE THAT ALOWED THEM TO SCHOOL ANDKNOW THE DISTANCE TO DIFFERENT THINGS AND BE ABLE STEER ROUND QUARREL THEY FEEL PROXIMITY YIT BE CON'T LIKE IF YOU'RE TURNING GOING TO AND THEY CAN EVEN RECOGNIZE SPECIFIC LATERAL LINE OM SIGNATURES TO BE LIKE YOU AND MARKLEY WALKINGTHE OTHE THROUGH THE DARK BUT MAYBE PEOPLE SIFT AROUND E YOURE LIKE YOU DO'T HAE TO LOOK AT THAT'S MARK YOU CON'D OF LEARN HIM IN TO LIKE A FISH CAN DO THAT SHARKS CAN SENSE WHETHER NOT THE LATERAL LINE IS IS UM HUT SAY VIBRING BUT FIRING AT OF PARTICULAR FREQUENCY TO KNOW OH THAT FISH IS LIKE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER THAN THE REST I MEAN THET YOU KNON'T HUNTING ANIMALS JUST THEY DEVELOP THESE INCREDIBLE SENSES AND UM I THINK HUMANS HAVE SOME OF THESE KIND OF SENSES IND MORE RUDIMENTARY WAVE WE'RE JUST NOT FORCE TO USE THEM UNLESS OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE BECOME A HUNTER OF ANIMALS ARE A HUNTER OF HUMANS AND YOU TAP INTO THESE NERAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE VERY PRIMITIVE AND HARD WIRED IN EVERYBODY BUT OF COURSE THEY'RE HONED IN IN M IN WARRIORS UM WHEN I COULD SPIRAL OFF INTO ANIMAL BIOLOGY IN A WAYS THAT I TRULY WOULD TAKE US TWENTY SIX HOURS I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT UM I'M ALMOST HASN'TIN TO ASK THIS QUESTION BUT UM IM CAN AT DO IT ANYWAY MANY TIMES ON LINE YOU ARE ASKED WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL RUN FOR OFFICE AND I WANT TO SAY THAT I HIT'S A TRUE COMPLIMENT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE ASKING JUST O CIND OF ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES I THINK THAT UM THIS COUNTRY CERTAINLY IN A LOT OF THE WORLD IS DESPERATE FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF LEADERS AND PEOPLE TO HAVE EXPERIENCE IN HIRISK HIG CONSEQUENCE CHAOTIC SITUATIONS AND HAVE SHOWN PROWESS AT LEADERSHIP IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS AN UM YOU ARE CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS UM AND SO THEY ASKED FOR THAT REASON AMONG OTHERS AND I'VE HEARD YOU GIVE YOUR ANSWER YOU CAN REPEAT IT AGAIN HERE BUT AS A MORE BROAD THEME THAT I THINK OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN DO YOU THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CRITERIA OR IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE  PEOPLE AND POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP WHO HAD WARTIME EXPERIENCE U AND YOU THINK TH A SOME OF THE SHIFTS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF M PATTERNS OF LEADERSHIP OVER THE LAST LESS JUST MAKE IT REAL BROAD SO THAT THIS ISN'T EVE RELATE TO ANY PARTICULAR PERSON OR STRETCH OF OF HISTERY BUT OVER THE LAST LESS JUST TAY TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'M REFLECTIV HAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF THAT AT LEAST AT THE TOP TEARS OF LEADERSHIP YOU I THINK IT BE EXCELLENT IF  PEOPLE MEADEF IF THE PRESIDENT HAD MILITARY EXPERIENCE FOR SURE I THINK THAT THEN THEY UNDERSTAND THE WITH THE WAY THE MILITARY WORKS BETTER I'M THEY UNDERSTAND THAT EACH ES CIVILIANS THAT CONTROL THE MILITARY CAUSE LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE AT A CIFLIANS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ENS CONTROL THE MILITARY A ND I THINK THAT YOU DO GET TO APPRECIATE WHAT WAR AXTUALLY IS AND WHAT THE COSTS ARE I THINK THAT A YOU'VE I'VE I'VE SEEN IN THE SAME VAIN OF PEOPLE ASKING ME TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE I'VE HEARD YOU DON'T SEEN COMMENT SAYING OH THAT'S WHAT WE NEED ANOTHER WARM A A WAR MONGER IN IN OFFICE AND I'VL RESPONDED A FEW OF THOSE I THINK IF THERE'S ANY IF THERE'S ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT WAR IT'S PEOPLE THAUT HAVE SEEN IT PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHAT THE SACRIFICES ARE AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT BEING IN THE MILITARY PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER SO YET I THINK IT BE A GREAT QUALIFICATION I DON'T THINK IT'S MANDITORY MEAN CLEARLY IT'S NOT WITHAT A MUNCH OF PRESIDENTS THAT HAVEN'T EVER SERVED ANYTHING REALLY WETE HAD A MUNCH OF PRESENCE THAT HAVEN'T EVER SERVED ANYTHING BUT THEMSELVES 'M SO YET HOPEFULLY WILL GET SOME MORE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY SOME COMBAT EXPERIENCE WOULD BE ESPECIALLY NICE AND TI'LL BE GOOD IN MY OPINION WELL I'M CERTAINLY NOT ONE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO AND I'M CERTAINLY NOTHCAN TELL YOU WHAT TO DO BUT SHOULD YOU EVER CHOOSE TO RUN I WOULD CERTAINLY IM BE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT AND AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT IM WITH THAT STATED A I HOPE PEOPLE DO HEAR WHAT YOU J SAID I SHARE THAT SENTIMENT IM PEOPLE WHO HAVE LED OTHERS BESIDES THEMSELVES I THINK IS IS THE KEY STATEMENT THERE YET  I'D LOOK I JUST I'VE IE FRIENDS AT ER POLITICIANS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND IT LOOKS MISERABLE TO ME I DON'T LIKE I DON'T LIKE WHAT I GOOD FOR THEM I'M HAPPY THAT THE'RE IN THEIR TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE I'M AND AND I GUESS THIS IS ME BEING SELFISH OF MESANT LOOK I DONN'T THINK I COULD STOMACH THAT AND I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNO RIGHT NOW I'M YOU I'M TRYING TO HELP OUT LIKE FOR INSINCE YERE WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY GOT THE LEADERS AF CONSULTING IT ACIAL ON FRONT WHICH CAN TO HELP BUSINESSIS GROW I'VE GOT ORIGIN YOU ESSAY WERE BRINGING MANUFACTURING BACK TO AMERICA WE'VE GOT HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE HERE IN AMERICA WORKING AND GROWING THAT BUSINESS A OBVIOUSLY SUPPLEMENCE TO EVERYTHING THAT I'M DOING HERE RIGHT NOW IS TO E TRYIN MOVE THE NEEDLE WITH WITH AMERICA BRINGING MANUFACTURING BACK HELPING THE ECONOMY AS MUCH AS A CAN RIHT NOW SO THAT'S IT'S KIND OF ONE O'M DOING RIGHT NOW AN END YOU KNOW MY STANDARD ANSWER WHICH YOU ALLUDED TO AS IF THINGS GOT BAD ENOUGH YOU KNOW THEN I WOULD I WOULD DO WHAT I HAD TO DO BUT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE APPRECIATE MY LEVEL OF BAD I'M TALKING REAL A SO IT'S NOT THERE YET AND HOPE WE NEVER WILL GET THERE I'D I'D RATHER OBSERF AND HANG OU MY FRIENDS AND AND HANG L MY FAMILY THEN DO THAT AND HOPEFULLY AMERICA CAN CAN FINED SOME LEVEL OF BALANCE YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WERE HAVING IT NOW AND A LOT OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT BUT SPECIFICALLY THINK YOU TALK ABOUT A SOCIAL MEDIAS NOT VERY GOOD FOR POLITICAL BALANCE IT'S IT'S EXACTLY HORRIBLE FOUR POLITICAL BALANCE AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH JUST A WAY THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAD A LOT IT HAS TO DO WITHE EGO AS WELL BECAUSE I DON'T EVERY ONE WHO ADMIT THAT I'M WRONG ABOUT ANYTHING AND IF IF I CAN FIND SOMETHING THAT I THINK YOU MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT IT'S SO SATISFYIND TO MY EGO TO JUST CALL YOU OUT ON THAT THING AND ATTACK YOU AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW NOW THAT BEING SAID ALSO I ALSO USUALLY SAY THIS AS WELL I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRYALL THE TIME I WORK WITH COMPANIES OF ALL SIZES WORK WITH PEOPLE IN EVERY DIFFERENT INDUSTRY AND THE'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT SITTING ROUND ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT WOULD THE POT THE POLITICAL SCENERY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HEY HOW CAN WE GROWR BUSINESS HOW CAN WE TAKE CARE OF OUR WORKERS HOW CAN WE TAKE CARE OF OUR CLIENTS HOW CAN WE TAKE OUR OUR CUSTOMER THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE FOCUSSED ON AND WHEN YOU JUMP ON SOCIAL MEDIA YO YOU CAN GET SUCKED IN TO THE POLITICAL SCENE VERY EASILY AND THAT BEING SAID ALSO WE DO HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE YOU YOU KNO WE A CITIZENS HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT AMERICA STAYS ON THE ON THE CORRECT PATH WITHIN THE GARDRAILS OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS BASED ON SO WE YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION IM BUT I WILL BE DOING MY PART AS A CIVILIAN UNTIL THERE'S TOTAL MAHAM AND CHAOS IN THE STREETS THEN I'LL PROBABLY JUST BE A BENEVOLENT DICTATOR THAT TAKES OVER O BE AN INTERESTING OMUT HEY

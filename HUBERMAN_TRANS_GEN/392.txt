WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAPPONCENS WDISCUSS SCIENCE SCIENC PAC TO S FORLIFE I MAND YOUR HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NAUROBIOLOGY AND OPTOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING GROWTH MIND SET GROWTH MIND SET IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND POWERFUL CONCEPTS IN ALL OF PSYCHOLOGY GROWTH MINDSET IS ESSENTIALLY AWAY OF EMBRACING CHALLENGE AND THINKING ABOUT YOUR BODILY AND BRAINS RESPONSE TO CHALLENGE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO OPTIMIZE YOUR PERFORMANCE GROWTH MIN SET CONSISTS OF MANY THINGS WHICH WE WILL DISCUSS TO DAY AND OF COURSE WE WILL DISCUSS HOW TO IMPLEMENT GROWTH MINE SET BUT SOME OF THE KEY FEATURES OF GROWTH MIND SET ARE DEVELOPING IN ABILITY TO DISTANCE YOUR IDENTITY FROM THE CHALLENGE YOU HAPPEN TO BE EMBRACING NOW THAT MIG COME AS A BIT OF A SURPRISE TO MANY OF YOU FOR INSTANCE WE GROW UP HEARING WE HOPE FROM TIME TO TIME THAT WE ARE SMART THAT WE ARE TALENTED THAT WE ARE GOOD ATHLETE THAT WE ARE GOOD ARTIST YOU KNOW WE LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE GOOD AT SOMETHING OR PERHAPS MANYTHINGS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE KIND OF PRAISE OR FEED BACK THAT WE RECEIVE THAT ATTACHES OUR IDENTITY TO PERFORMANCE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERMINE OUR PERFORMANCE AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR PEOPLE THAT PERFORM WELL IN THEIR ENDEAVORS THAT'S RIGHT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO PERFORMS WELL IN SCHOOL OR ATHLETICS OR MUSIC AND YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU ARE VERY SMART THAT YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT STUDENT THAT YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT ATHLETE OR THAT YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT MUSICIAN YOU HAVE MUCH TO LOSE IF YOU AT ANY MOMENT DO NOT PERFORM WELL AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR IDENTITY HAS BEEN INTEGRATED WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVELY GROWTH MINDS ET IS THE PROCESS OF DISTANCING YOUR IDENTITY FROM PERFORMANCE AND RATHER ATTACHING YOUR IDENTITY AND YOUR EFFORTS AND YOUR SENSE OF MOTIVATION TO EFFORT ITSELF AND TO THE PROCESS OF ENJOYING LEARNING AND GETTING BETTER AT LEARNING ANYTHING SO TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS WHAT GROWTH MIND SET IS AND WHAT IT ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN DISCUSSED IN TERMS THAT FRANKLY ARE NOT ACCURATE TO THE SCIENCE WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER MIND SET WHICH IS THE STRESS IS ENHANCING MINE SET THAT IT TURNS OUT CAN ACT SYNERGISTICALLY WITH GROWTH MIND SET SUCH THAT WHEN YOU COMBINE GROWTH MIND SET WITH THE STRESS IS ENHANCING MINE SET YOU AND ANY ONE IT'S BEEN SHOWN CAN IT VASTLY IMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE IN ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING SO TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL OF COURSE EXPLORE THE CLASSIC WORK OF CAROLL DWEK WHO WAS REALLY THE FOUNDER OF THE GROWTH MINE SET FIELD AS WELL AS SOME OF THE NEWER RESEARCH FROM PEOPLE LIKE DAVID YEGER ALY CRUM AND OTHERS WHO HAVE EXPLORED HOW GROWTH MIND SET AND STRESSES AN HANCING MIN SETS CAN BE APPLIED BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND REALLY IN PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS BY THE ENDIDAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE A RICH UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENCE AS WELL AS MANY TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY IN EVERYDAY LIFE IN ESSENTIALLY ANY ENDEAVOR BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS EIHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY THERE'S ABSOLUTE NO QUESTION THAT SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING WELL AND WERE SLEEPING LONG ENOUGH EVERYTHING IN OUR DAILY LIFE GOES THAT MUCH BETTER NOW A KEY COMPONENT TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR COR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES CONVERSELY IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED YOUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVERS YOU CAN COOL OR HEAT YOUR MATTRESS AT THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF YOUR NIGHT IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE YOUR NIGHT SLEEP I START SLEEPING ON AN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND IT HAS DRAMMATICALLY IMPROVE THE SLEEP THAT I GET EACH IN EVERY NIG IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND SAVE UP TO A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U SSA CANADA U K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ROCA ROCA MAKES EYEGLASSES AND SUNGLASSES THAT ARE OF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY I'VE SPENT A LIFETIME WORKING ON THE BIOLOGY THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM HAS TO CONTEND WITH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE CLEARLY ROCA UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THOSE CHALLENGES AT THE LEVEL OF THE EYE AND THE VISUAL SYSTEM WITHIN THE BRAIN AND HAVE DESIGNE THEIR EYEGLASSES AND SUN GLASSES SO THAT NO MATTER WHAT ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE IN YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE WITH CRYSTAL CLARITY ORIGINALLY THEIR GLASSES WERE DESIGNED FOR SPORTS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE ALL OF THEIR GLASSES ARE EXTREMELY LIGHT WEIGHT AND AS WELL THEY WON'T SLIP OFF YOUR FACE EVEN IF YOU GET SWEATY HOWEVER TO SPITE BEING DESIGNED IN ISSIALLY FOR PERFORMANCE ROCA EYEGLASSES AND SON GLASSES INCLUDE A LOT OF DIFFERENT STYLES THAT RESIGNED FOR YOU TO WEAR TO WORK OR OUT TO DINNER AS WELL AS THE WHAT I CALL THE SIDEBOARD STYLE THE DESIGNE FOR CYCLING ET SCETERA IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ROCA EYEGLASSES AR SUNGLASSES GO TO ROCA THAT'S R O K A DOCK CAM AND ENTER THE CODE HUBERMEN TO SAVE TWENTY PER CENT OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER AGAIN THAT'S ROCA AR O K A DOC CAM AND ENTER THE CODE HUBERMEN AT CHECKOUT LET'S TALK ABOUT GROWTH MIN SET GROWTH MINE SET AS THE NAME SUGGESTS ITIS THE IDEA THAT WE CAN GET BETTER AT THINGS THAT IS THAT OUR ABILITIES ARE NOT FIXED BUT RATHER THAT OUR ABILITIES ARE MALLEABLE AND AT THE CORE OF GROWTH MINE SET IS THE IDEA THAT OUR BRAINS CAN CHANGE AND INDEED THEY CAN WE REFER TO THAT ABILITY AS NERRO PLASTICITY OR THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE I'VE DONE SEVERAL EPISODES ABOUT NERRO PLASTICITY SO THAT'S A TOPIC UNTO ITSELF BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT NEURO PLASTICITY BRAIN CHANGE CAN OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LIFE SPEN IT IS FAR MORE ROBASS TO EARLY IN LIFE FROM BIRTH UNTIL ABOUT AGE TWENTY FI I'VE NERROL PLASTICITY IS SORT OF THE DEFAULT PROCESS OUR BRAIN IS BEING SHAPED BY OUR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES BUT CERTAINLY FROM AGE TWENTY FIVE AND ONWARD AND CERTAINLY WELL INTO PEOPLE'S NINETIES EVEN IT'S BEEN SHOWN THE BRAIN CAN CHANGE IF WE WANT IT TO IT CAN CHANGE FOR THE WORSE OF COURSE THROUGH INJURY OR DISEASE THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT IT ALSO CAN CHANGE FOR THE BETTER THROUGH DELIBERATE FOCUS BOUTS OF LEARNING WE CAN LEARN NEW LANGUAGES WE CAN LEARN ART WE CAN LEARN MUSIC WE CAN GET SMARTER WE CAN GET BETTER AT ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING IF WE DEVOTE OUR ATTENTIONAL RESOURCES TO LEARNING THOSE THINGS SO REALLY ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT GROWTH MIN SET HAS AS A SUBTEXT A DISCUSSION ABOUT NARROW PLASTICITY ALTHOUGH TO DAY WE AREN'T GOING TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON NERROW PLASTICITY MEANING WE AREN'T GOING TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE NARL CIRCUIT AND NERRW CHEMICAL CHANGES THAT UNDER LIE NERROL PLASTICITY BECAUSE I'VE COVERED THOSE ON PREVIOUS EPISODES TALK ABOUT THEM A LITTLE BIT TO DAY BUT WE ARE MAINLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DATA THE STUDIES FROM THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY APPLYING GROWTH MINE SET IN AND OUT OF THE CLASS ROOM IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS EVERY DAY TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO ENHANCE GROWTH MINE SET FOR YOURSELF AND PERHAPS FOR THOSE AROUND YOU IF YOU CARED TO TEACH GROWTH MINE SET WHICH AS YOU'LL LEARN LATER TURNS OUT TO BE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO REINFORCE YOUR OWN GROWTH MINE SET AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO APPLY THOSE TOOLS IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT DOMAINS MUSICAL ATHLETIC INTELLECTUAL AND ON AND ON NO DISCUSSION OF GROWTH MINE SET WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT MENTIONING THAT GROWTH MINE SET IS THE BRAIN CHILD OF MY COLLEAGUE CAROL DUECKIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY TODAY YOU'LL LEARN HOW SHE DISCOVERED GROWTH MINE SET AND YOU WILL LEARN HOW OTHERS HAVE TAKEN THAT DISCOVERY AND EXPANDED UPON IT AND ESPECIALLY ITS APPLICATION IN AND OUT OF THE CLASS ROOM TO START OFF OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT GROWTH MINE SET HOWEVER WE NEED TO DEFINE WHAT A MINE SET IS I THINK MOST OF US THINK WE KNOW WHAT A MINE SET IS WE THINK OH IT'S KIND OF A A MENTAL STANCE WHERE YOU KNOW WE ARE POSITIVE OR WE ARE NEGATIVE OR WE BELIEVE SOMETHING OR WE DON'T BELIEVE SOMETHING BUT A MIND SET ACTUALLY HAS A VERY SPECIFIC DEFINITION AND HERE I'M REFERRING TO THE DEFINITION PROVIDED BY DOCTOR ALYCRUM ALLYCRUM IS ALSO PROFESSOR PSYCHOLOGY AT STAMFORD SHE RUNS HER OWN LABORATORY WORKING ON STRESS RELATED MIND SETS AND OTHER MIND SETS SHE'S ECTULLY BEEN A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST PREVIOUSLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU LISTEN TO THAT EPISODE IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DOCTOR CRUM DEFINES O MIND SET AS QUOTE A MENTAL FRAME OR LENS THAT SELECTIVELY ORGANIZES AND IN CODES INFORMATION AND I THINK THE KEY THING TO HIGHLIGHT THERE IS ORGANIZES INFORMATION BECAUSE AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING BOMBARDED WITH INFORMATION FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD SENSORY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR VISUAL SYSTEM WHAT WE'RE HEARING WHAT WE'RE SEEING WHAT WE'RE FEELING WE ARE ALSO BOMBARDED WITH INTERNAL SENSATIONS OF HOW FULL OR EMPTY OUR GOTFIELS ARE WE HUNGRY ARE WE TIRED ARE WE ANXIOUS ARE WE CALM ET CETERA SO TONSANTONS OF INFORMATION FUNDLING INTO OUR BRAIN AND MIND SETS REALLY HELP US ORGANIZE THAT INFORMATION SUCH THAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT OTHERS AND WE RESPOND TO CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT OTHERS AY SO HERE I'M NOT TRING TO PUT ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE ON SOMETHING SIMPLE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT COMPLEX I'M TRYING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF LANGUAGE THAT IS THAT A MIND SET DOES MANYTHINGS BUT IT MAINLY ORGANIZES INFORMATION I'LL ADD TO THAT FOR SPECIFIC ACTIONS OR INACTIONS IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO SIMPLIFY OUR WORLD IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE CERTAIN CHOICES AND DO AWAY WITH THINKING ABOUT AND ACTING ON OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION THE OTHER THING ABOUT MIN SETS IS THAT THEY INCLUDE INTIRE NARRATIVES AND MOST OF THE TIME WE AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF HOW THOSE NARRATIVES ARE OPERATING MEANING WE DON'T WALK AROUND LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WORLD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET BETTER AT FITNESS OR A SPORT OR MUSIC OR ARITHMATIC OR LANGUAGEIS OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER THINKING O K WHAT IS MY MENTAL FRAMER LENDS THAT SELECTIVELY ORGANIZES AND INCODES INFORMATION WE DON'T DO THAT INSTEAD WHAT WE HAVE ARE STORIES AND THOSE STORIES ARE USUALLY ATTACHED TO OUR SENSE OF IDENTITY LIKE I'LL JUST USE MYSELF FOR INSTANCE I DO NOT THINK OF MYSELF AS A GOOD MUSICIAN IN FACT I CAN'T READ MUSIC I'M TERRIBLE AT PLAYING INSTRUMENTS I LIKE LISTENING TO MUSIC BUT I CONSIDER MYSELF A TERRIBLE MUSICIAN RIGHT I'VE REALLY A SIGNED OF VALUE OR I'VE ASSIGNED MY VALUE TO MUSIC AND MY RELATIONSHIP TO MUSIC MIGHT WE TEND TO DO THAT WE CAN ALSODOIT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION RIT IVE RUNNING A LABORATORY FOR A LONG TIME N IN SCIENCE FOR YOU ENCLOSE TO THREE DECADES SOV YOU ASK ME YOU KNOW DO I FEEL PROFICIENT AT SCIENCE AC A AM PROFICIENT SCIENCE I KNOW HOW TO DO EXPERIMENT SET UP EXPERIMENTS RIGHT RESEARCH PAPERS RIGHT GRANTS ET CETERA I'M PRETTY GOOD AT IT RIGHT WE TEND TO DECIDE IF WE ARE GOOD OR BAD AT THINGS AND WE TEND TO INTEGRATE THOSE WITH OUR IDENTITY SOMEWHAT OR A LOT DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW WE'RE PROFESSIONAL OR AMATEUR OR HOW MUCH WENGAGIN AN ACTIVITY THE POINT BEING THAT MIND SETS INCLUDE ALL OF THESE NARRATIVES AND OFTEN THOSE NARRATIVES ARE VISIBLE TO US IF WE THINK ABOUT THEM BUT MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD MEANING SCHOOL WORK RELATIONSHIPS AND ALL OUR ENDEAVORS WITHOUT A LOT OF CAREFUL THOUGHT ABOUT THE NARRATIVES WE CARRY AND THE BEAUTY OF GROWTH MINE SET IS THAT IT FORCES US TO STEP BACK AND ASK OURSELF SOME SIMPLE QUESTIONS THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT YOU COULD ASK YOURSELF RIGHT NOW IN FACT A HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO COULD ASK YOURSELF FOR INSTANCE WHAT HAVE I BEEN TOLD I'M REALLY GOOD AT SHOULD ALSO ASK YOURSELF WHAT HAVE I BEEN TOLD I'M REALLY POOR AT THAT I'M JUST NOT GOOD AT WHAT HAVE I TOLD MY SELF I'M REALLY GOOD AT AND WHAT HAVE I TOLD MYSELF I'M REALLY BAD AT AND THEN A SECOND SET OF QUESTIONS IS WHAT AM I GOOD AT AND WHY DID IT COME NATURALLY TO ME DID I APPLY MYSELF FOR MANY YEARS MEANING DID I APPLY LOT OF EFFORT TO LEARNING THAT THING OR PERHAPS BOTH RIGHT AND THEN IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO ASK YOURSELF WHY AM I NOT GOOD AT OTHER THINGS IS IT SIMPLY BECAUSE YOUE NEVER APPLIED YOURSELF AT THOSE THINGS OR IS IT BECAUSE YOU TRIED AND HAD AN EARLY FAILURE OR PERHAPS YOU TRIED AND TRIED AND TRIED FOR MANY YEARS AND YOU CONTINUED TO FAIL AT THAT THING OR YOU JUST DIDN'T REACH A LEVEL OF PROFICIENCY THAT MADE YOU WANT TO PURSUE IT FURTHER EN ASKING YOURSELFS THOSE QUESTIONS YOU ARE ASKING YOURSELF NOT JUST WHAT YOU'R GOOD AT AN BAD AT AND WHY YOU SHOULD ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT WEAR THE MESSAGES OF BEING GOOD AT SOMETHING OR BEING BAD AT SOMETHING ARRIVED FROM DID THEY ARRIVE FROM OUTSIDE YOU MEANING FROM YOUR PARENTS FROM YOUR COACHES FROM YOUR TEACHERS OR WAS IT THE CASE THAT TESPITE A LOT OF POSITIVE FEE BACK YEUCH SORT OF DECIDED YOU WEREN'T GOOD AT SOMETHING OR CONVERSELY WAS IT THE CASE THAT DOSPITE A LOT OF NEGATIVE FEE BACK THAT YU WOULD NEVER BE GOOD AT SOMETHING OR THAT YOU WEREN'T GOOD AT SOMETHING THAT YOU CONTINUE TO PERSIST BECAUE THEYRE CERTAINLY PEOPLE LIKE THAT THE MORE NEGATIVE FEE BACK THEY GET THE MORE THEY DIG THEIR HEELS IN TO PROVE THEMSELVES AS CAPABLE OF BECOMING GOOD AT SOMETHING SO I DO RECOMMEND AS WE MARCH FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS WHAT AM I GOOD AT WHAT AM I BAD AT WHY AM I GOOD AT THOSE THINGS WHY AM I BAD AT THOSE THINGS AND ASK YOURSELF TO WHAT EXTENT YOUR LABELS THAT IS YOUR IDENTITY IS ATTACHED TO THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE GOOD AT OR BAD AT AND THE REASON I'D LIKE YOU TO ASK YOURSELF THOSE QUESTIONS IS THAT NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME RESEARCH FROM DOCTOR CARROLL DRUCK'S LABORATORY THAT WAS REALLY THE SEED OF THE ENTIRE FIELD OF GROWTH MINE SET IT RELATES TO A SPECIFIC SET OF EXPERIMENTS THAT REALLY SHOW THAT THE SPECIFIC FEED BACK WE GET MEANING WHETHER OR NOT WE GET FEED BACK THAT IS ATTACHED TO OUR IDENTITY LIKE A LABEL LIKE SMART OR GREAT ATHLETE OR TALENTED SENDS US DOWN A VERY DIFFERENT PATH OF PERFORMANCE IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN AS COMPARED TO WHETHER NOT WE RECEIVE FEE BACK THAT'S BASED ON EFFORT MEANING YOU TRIED REALLY HARD OR YOU REALLY SEEM TO APPLY YOURSELF UNDER CONDICIONS WHERE YOU'RE GETTING THE RIGHT ANSWER OVER TIME BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY REFUSE TO QUIT HOSE ARE TWO VERY DIVERGENT SETS OF FEED BACK AND AS YOU'LL LEARN IN A MOMENT THE SORTS OF FEED BACK THAT WE GET ESPECIALLY EARLY IN LIFE OR EARLY IN AN ENDEAVOR SO THIS DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO YOUNG KIDS THAS SUPPLIES TO ADULTS TO OR TAKING ON A NEW SKILL OR R TRYING TO EXPAND ON AN EXISTING SKILL THOSE TO DIVERGENT FORMS OF FEED BACK GET INTEGRATED INTO OUR CORPS BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT WE THINK IS POSSIBLE FOR US IN A GIVEN ENDEAVOR AND THE GREAT NEWS IS WE CAN ALSO MODIFY THOSE CORD BELIEFS SIMPLY BY CHANGING THE FEED BACK THAT WE GIVE OURSELVES THE RESEARCH PAPER I LIKE TO DISCUSS BRIEFLY THAT BEAUTIFULLY EMBODIES THE RUNWAY THAT LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF GROWTH MINE SET IS A PAPER FROM DOCTOR CARRLDUEC AS WELL AS HER COLLEAGUE A CLOTDY AMULER AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER ESSENTIALLY SES AT ALL THE TITLE IS PRAISE FOR INTELLIGENCE CAN UNDERMINE CHILDREN'S MOTIVATION AND PERFORMANCE THAT SHOULD BE SURPRISING THAT PRAISE FOR INTELLIGENCE CAN UNDERMINE MOTIVATION AND PERFORMANCE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE PROBABLY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU TELL A CHILD OR AN ADULT THAT THEY'E REALLY GOOD AT SOMETHING AND YOU'RE GENUINE ABOUT THAT FEED BACK MEANING THEI'RE PERFORMING WELL AND YOUS AT GREAT YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL YOU'RE SO SMART YOU'RE SO TALENTED THAT THEIRE PERFORMANCE WOULD CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THAT IT WOULD BOLSTER THEIR MOTIVATION TO ENGAGE IN THAT ACTIVITY WHICH HOPEFULLY THEY ENJOY BUT REGARDLESS PROVIDED THAT IT'S A SAFE ACTIVITY IT'S EDUCATIONAL WHAT HAVE YOU THAT IT WOULD SERVE TO ENCOURAGE THEM I THE KID THINKS NOT ONLY AM I ENGAGING THIS ACTIVITY BUT I'M GETTING POSITIVE FEED BACK PRESUME LY FROM PEOPLE THAT I CAREABOUT OR WHOSE OPINION I CARE ABOUT WOULDD THAT SERVE TO ELEVATE PERFORMANCE IT DOES NOT IN FACT THE EXACT OPPOSITE HAPPEN SOLDIES GIVE YOU A FEW OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM THIS STUDY THE WAY IT WAS DONE IS VERY INTERESTING THEY ESSENTIALLY GAVE FEED BACK ABOUT PERFORMANCE THAT WAS LINKED UP WITH A CHILD'S INTELLIGENCE TELLING KID THEIR SMART THEIR TALENTED TH AT THEY CAN LEARN THINGS REALLY EASILY UM OR THAT THEIR VERY GOOD AT LEARNING THIS SORT OF THING AND THEY CALLED THAT INTELLIGENCE FEED BACK OR THEY GAVE THEM WHAT WAS CALLED EFFORT FEED BACK THE SIMPLE WAY TO THINK ABOUT EFFORT FEEDBACK IS THAT IT'S MORE ATTACHED TO VERBS AS OPPOSED TO LABELS SO EFFORT FEED BACK CONSIST OF THINGS LIKE YOU TRIED REALLY HARD ON THAT PROBLEM IT WAS GREAT THE WAY THAT YOU APPLIED EFFORT IT WAS GREAT THE WAY TAT YOU PERSISTED IT WAS GREAT THE WAY THAT EVEN WHEN YOU GOT THE WRONG ANSWER YOU SPEND TEN MINUTES THINKING ABOUT IT AND THEN YOU TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN OR IN SOME CASES EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER TELLING THEM WELL EVEN THOUG YOUDN'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER IT'S REALLY TERRIFIC THAT YOU CONTINUED TO TRY OCASSO INTELLIGENCE FEED BACK WAS THE SORT OF FEED BACK THAT WAS TIED TO LABELS OF IDENTITY THINGS LIKE SMART TALENTED ET CETERA WHEREAS EFFORT FEED BACK WAS TIED TO VERBS CHOICES BEHAVIOAL AND COGNIM CHOICES THAT CHILDREN MADE IN AN EFFORT TO LEARN OR GET BETTER ET SOMETHING SO IN THIS STUDY WHICH INCLUDED OVER A HUNDRED CHILDREN THEY EITHER GOT THE INTELLIGENCE TYPE FEED BACK OR THE EFFORT TIGHT FEED BACK OR THERE WAS A CONTROL GROUP THAT DIDN'T GET EITHER THE INTELLIGENCE OR THE EFFORT TIGHT FEED BACK AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT NUMBER DIFFERENT OUTCOMES O ALL JUST A HIGHLIGHT OF FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT THEY FOUND FIRST OF ALL THE KIDS THAT GOT THE INTELLIGENCE BACE FEED BACK WHEN THEY WERE THEN LATER OFFERED PROBLEM SETS THAT WERE EITHER CHALLENGING OR WERE OF THE SORT THAT THEY KNEW THEY COULD PERFORM WELL ON THEY TENDED TO SELECT PROBLEMS THAT THEY KNEW THEY COULD PERFORM WELL ON THESE WERE WHAT WERE REFERRED TO AS PERFORMANT SCHOOLS IN OTHER WORDS THEY PICKED PROBLEMS THAT ALLOWED THEM TO CONTINUE TO GET THE PRAISE THAT THEY RECEIVED PREVIOUSLY ABOUT BEING SMART OR TALENTED WHEREAS THE KIDS THEY GOT FEED BACK ABOUT THEIR STRONG EFFORT WHEN LATER PRESENTED WITH PROBLEMS THAT WERE EITHER EASY OR HARD MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY PICKED THE HARDER PROBLEMS THAT STOOD TO TEACH THEM MORE SO THAT'S STRIKING IT SAYS THAT IF YOU TELL A KID THAT THEIR SMART OR TALENTED AND THAT'S THE REASON W Y THEY PERFORM WELL WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES THEY ARE LIKELY TO GO WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CHALLENGE SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THAT PRAISE OR FEED BACK WHEREAS IF YOU RECEIVE PRAISE AND FEED BACK FOR YOUR STRONG EFFORT THEN LATER YOU TEND TO PICK ENVIRONMENTS PROBLEMS ATS ET CETERA THAT ALLOW YOU TO EXERT THE VERY EFFORT THAY GOT YOU THE PRAISE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO IN BOTH CASES THESE CHILDREN ARE ESSENTIALLY ATTACHED TO THE PRAISE RIGHT IN SOME SENSE I MEAN WE LIKE TO THINK THAT THEY ENJOY THESE ACTIVITIES IN THEIR BENEFITING FROM THEM AS WELL BUT IN BOTH CASES THE PRAISE REALLY SERVES TO REENFORCE A CERTAIN PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR BUT IN THE CASE OF GIVING INTELLIGENCE FEED BACK THE KIDS ARE REALLY JUST TRYING TO REENFORCE BEING TOLD THAT THEIR SMARTER CHALLENTED AS OPPOSED TO REENFORCING THE ENGAGEMENT IN THE ACTIVITY THAT GOT THEM THE PRAISE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THE CONVERSE IS ALSO TRUE WHEN KIDS ARE TOLD HEY YOU REALLY TRIED HARD AND THAT'S GREAT OR I LIKE HOW YOU PERSISTED OR YOUR SO PERSISTENT I CAN REALLY SEE HOW PERSISTENT YOU ARE IN TRYING TO GET THE RIGHT ANSWER EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER WELL THEN WHEN YOU PRESENT THOSE KIDS WITH ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THEY WORK VERY HARD TO STAY IN CHALLENGE AND GUESS WHAT NO SURPRISE THE KIDS THAT ARE REWARDED FOR EFFORT AND THAT CONTINUE TO PICK HARDER PROBLEMS OUT PERFORM THE KIDS THAT ARE GIVEN THE INTELLIGENCE PRISE AND FEED BACK BY A LARGE MARGIN SO WHAT IS THIS TELL US THIS TELLS US THAT THE NARRATIVES THAT WE HEAR FROM OTHERS OF COURSE REENFORCE CERTAIN PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR WHAT ELSE DOES THIS TELL US THIS TELLS US THAT IF YOURE APPARENTER TEACHER YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT GIVING FEED BACK TO A CHILD THAT IS ATTACHED TO THEIR IDENTITY AROUND AND ENDEAVOR ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE PERFORMING WELL AT THAT ENDEAVOR RIGHT OF COURSE IF CHILD IS NOT PERFORMING WELL AT SOMETHING YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM THAT THE'R STUPID RIGHT YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE DEFICIENT RIGHT BUT THAT'S A RARE OCCURRENCE IN THE CLASSROM ONE WOULD HOPE THAT'S A RARE OCCURRENCE ON THE FIELD ONE WOULD HOPE BUT WHAT'S V ERY COMMON VERY VERY COMMON IS THAT WHEN WE SEE CHILDREN OR ADULTS PERFORMING WELL WE TEND TO GIVE THEM IDENTITY LABELS AS A WAY TO TRY IND REINFORCE WHATEVER BEHAVIOR WE OBSERVE AND WE LIKE NOW THE OTHER THING THEY LOOKED AT IN THE STUDY BESIDES WHETHER NOT THESE KIDS WOULD PICK HARD OR EASIER CHALLENGES DOWN THE LINE WERE THE ACTUAL RAW PERFORMANCE ON COGNATIVE PROBLEMS AND THESE DATE I MUST SAY ARE JUST SO INTERESTING THEY TOOK THE KIDS AND THEY GAVE THEM ALL THE SAME PROBLEM SETS AND ALL THE KIDS ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER NOT THEY WERE GETTING INTELLIGENCE PRAISE OR EFFORT PRAISE WHERE THEY WERE IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE PERFORMING MORE OR LESS THE SAME WAY THEY WERE GETTING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS RIGHT SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS WRONG THEN THEY GAVE THEM PRAISE AFTER THEY COMPLETED THOSE PROBLEMS THEY EITHER GOT INTELLIGENCE PRAISE YOU'RE SO SMART YOURE SO TALENTED OR THEY GOT EFFORT PRAISE YOU TRIED SO HARD YOU REALLY PERSISTED THAT FANTASTIC THEN LATER THEY GAVE THEM ANOTHER SET OF PROBLEMS AND THEY LOOKED AT PERFORMANCE NOW REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME AROUND ALL THE KIDS GOT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS RIGHT IN SOME O THE QUESTIONS WRONG SO THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT FOR EVERYBODY WHAT THEY FOUND WAS ABSOLUTELY STRIKING THE KIDS THAT WERE IN THE CONTROL GROUP SO THEY DIDN'T GET ANY SPECIFIC FORM OF PRAISE THEY PERFORM MORE OR LESS THE SAME WAY AS THEY DID BEFORE SO IF THEY WERE GETTING TELL ME FIVE PER CENT OF THE ANSWERS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME THEY GOT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE ANSWERS RIGHT THE SECOND TIME TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WRONG IN BOTH CASES THE IDS THAT WERE IN THE INTELLIGENCE PRAISE GROUP THE YOU'RE SO SMART YOU'RE SO TALENTED PRAISE GROUP THEIR PERFORMANCE WENT DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY WHEREAS THE KIDS THAT WERE IN THE EFFORT PRAISE GROUP THEIR PERFORMANCE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY O CASE SO THIS IS A BY DIRECTIONAL EFFECT WERE GIVING INTELLIGENCE PRAISE REDUCES PERFORMANCE AND GIVING EFFORT PRAISE IMPROVES PERFORMANCE WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY STRIKING AND TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW WHICH IS IF YOUR APPARENT YOUR TEACHER AND OF COURSE AS WE ALL GIVE OURSELVES FEED BACK REWARDING YOURSELF FOR EFFORT IS THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE REWARDING YOURSELF BASED ON IDENTITY LABELS SO SMART SO TALENTED YOUR GREAT ATHLETE ET CETERA ALL THAT STAREIN THE MIRROR AND DO SELF AFFIRMATION STUFF CAN ACTUALLY UNDER MINE PERFORMANCE AND IN FACT IT DOES UNDER MINE PERFORMANE IT MAY NOT DO IT RIGHT AWAY BUT EVENTUALLY IT DOES AND IN A MOMENT I'LL EXPLAIN WHY THE OTHER THING THE STUDY LOOKED AT THAT I JUST HAVE TO MENTION IS THIS NOTION OF PERSISTENCE SO REMEMBER EARLIER I SAID THAT THE KIDS THAT GOT INTELLIGENCE PRAISE TENDED TO PICK EASIER PROBLEMS DOWN THE LINE WHEREAS THE KIDS THAT GOT EFFORT PRAISE TENDED TO PICK HARDER PROBLEMS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE KIDS THAT GOT INTELLIGENCE PRAISE ALSO TENDED TO TAKE ON FEWER PROBLEMS OVER ALL THEY TENDED TO LIMIT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT THEY ENGAGED IN WHEREAS THE KIDS THAT GOT THE EFFORT PRAISE THAT YOU WORK SO HARD YOU'RE SO DETERMINED THAT WAS SO IMPRESSIVE HOW YOU'VE JUST KEPT GOING EVEN WHEN YOU GOT SOME ANSWERS WRONG THOSE KID'S NOT ONLY OPTED FOR HARDER CHALLENGES THEY NOT ONLY PERFORMED BETTER BUT THEY ALSO TOOK ON MANY MORE CHALLENGES SO THESE DATA REALLY MAKE CLEAR THAT THE EFFORT PRAISE IS THE WAY TO GO NOW I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT DON'T REWARD THE PERSON REWARD THE EFFORT REWARD THE VERBS AS I'M REFERRING TO IT BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY RARE TAT WE HEAR EFFORT REWARDED IN EVERY DAY SETTINGS AND IT IS VERY COMMON FOR US TO OVER HEAR INTELLIGENCE PRAISE OR TALENT PRAISE YOU NOW KID COMES HOME WITH A TROPHY AND WE TLL THEM YOUR GREAT ATHLETE KID COMES HOME WITH A GREAT REPORT CARDING  YOU'RE SO SMART CONGRATULATIONS A KID COME HOME WITH SOME SORT OF WIN IN THEIR WORLD AND WE TEND TO GIVE THEM A LABEL BECAUSE WE LIKE TO THINK THAT THAT LABEL WILL GET INTERNALIZED AND THEY'LL START TO VIEW THEMSELVES AS A WINNER WE TELL THEM YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU'RE WINNER YOU'R WINNER AND OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL CHILDREN OR YOURSELF OR ANY OTHER ADULT YOU'RE A LOSER RIGHT WE DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT YOU DN'T WANT TO UNDER MINE PERFORMANCE THAT WAY BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR BASED ON THIS FOR SEARCH AND A LOT OF OTHER PAPERS SIMILAR TO IT THAT WE ALL HAVE A GIANT BL INE SPOT SITTING IN OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL FIELD WHEN WE ARE GETTING IN RECEIVING PRAISE THAT REALLY IT IS THE SORT OF PRAISE THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE VERY EFFORTS THAT LED TO THE RESULTS THAT WILL LEAD TO EVEN IMPROVED RESULTS OVER TIME O CAS O THIS PAPER IS REALLY TRULY IMPORTANT IT'S A LANDMARK PAPER IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY MOTIVATION LEARNING IN PERFORMANCE AND THAT'S WHY I'M DISCUSSING IT IN SUCH DETAIL HERE BUT IT ACTUALLY INCLUDES ONE ADDITIONAL PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT I ALSO THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT AND THAT IS THE TENDENCY FOR CHILDREN WHO GET INTELLIGENCE PRAISE TO MISREPRESENT THEIR PERFORMANCE ON SUBSEQUENT EFFORTS WHAT I MEAN BY THAT BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING IS IN THIS PAPER THEY HAVE THE CHILDREN PERFORM ON A GIVEN TASK AND THEN THEY EITHER GOT INTELLIGENCE PRAISE YOUR SO SMART YOUR SOTALENTED OR EFFORT PRAISE YOU WORK SO HARD YOUR SO DILIGENT YOU KEPT GOING EVEN WHEN YOU WERE FACED WITH RESULTS YOU DIDN'T LIKE AND THEN THEY HAVE THEM DO A SERIES OF OTHER TASKS AND THEN REPORT THEIR RESULTS TO OTHER KIDS ND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT CHILDREN WHO GET INTELLIGENCE PRAISE WHEN THEY NEED TO REPORT THEIR SCORES EITHER BY WALKING UP TO THE BOARD AND PUTTING A LITTLE MARK WHERE THEIR PARTICULAR SCORE IS OR TELLING ANOTHER STUDENT WHETHEIR SCORE WAS OR EVEN WRITING IT DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER COVERTLY SO THATIT'S NOT VISIBLY BEING COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER SCORES THE KIDS THAT GOT INTELLIGENCE PRAISE TEND TO LIE ABOUT THEIR SCORE AND AS YOU COULD IMAGINE THEY TEND TO LIE IN THE DIRECTION OF MAKING THEMSELVES APPEAR AS HAVING PERFORMED BETTER THAN THEY ACTUALLY DID SO THIS IS A PRETTY SINISTER ASPECT OF INTELLIGENCE PRAISE THAT WE DON'T OFTEN HEREABOUT EVEN IF YOU'VE HEARD TELLING A PERSON THAT THEY ARE SMART OR TALENTED CAN ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE PERFORMANCE RARELY IF EVER DO WE HEAR THAT TELLING SOME ONE THAT THEIR SMARTER TALENTED CAN INCREASE THE PROBABILITY THAT THAT PERSON IS GOING TO MISREPRESENT THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S TRUE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THEY PERFORM PRETTY WELL OR NOT IN THE PAST AD YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT THE K DS THAT WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE INTELLIGENT THAT THEIR TALENTED THAT THOSE KIDS YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE DOING WELL AND THEN SUDDENLY DID POORLY THAT THEY SLITHE THE SCORE UP A LITTLE BIT WE DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO DO THAT BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW A YOUNG KID MIGHT DO THAT TO CONT OF PRESERVE THEIR EGO BUT NOW IN SOME CASES THESE KIDS ARE ALREADY PERFORMING PRETTY WELL THEY'RE NOT GETING A HUNDRED PER CENT BUT THE PERFORMING IN THE TOP BRACKET AND YET IF THEY RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE PRAISE THEYRE STILL MORE LIKELY TO LIE ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE INCREASING IT FURTHER STILL WHEREAS THE KIDS THAT RECEIVED THE EFFORT PRAISE DO NO SUCH THING THEY FAITHFULLY REPRERSENT THEIR PERFORMANCE AND AS I MENTION BEFORE FOR MANY REASONS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES MEANING THE MECHANISMS AND WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN THE HEADS OF THESE KIDS THAT GET EFFORT PRAISE THEIR PERFORMING BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE SO JUST TO ILLUSTRATE HOW IMPORTANT THE FINDINGS IN THE STUDY REALLY ARE THE PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BUT JUST TWO YEARS PRIOR IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THERE WAS A SURVEY OF PARENTS ASKING TO WHAT EXTENT YOU BELIEVE THAT INTELLIGENCE IS FIXED AND EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT ANSWERED THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT INTELLIGENCE WAS FIXED THAT MEANS THEY BELIEVE THAT THE BRAIN WAS SORT OF A VESSEL OF FIXED SIZE THAT OF COURSE WHEN WE'RE BORNE INTO TE WORLD IS KIND OF EMPTY WE DON'T HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE BUT THAT THE JOB OF SCHOOLING WAS TO TEACH KIDS THINGS AND REVEAL AN INTELLIGENCE CAPACITY THAT WAS INNATE AND THAT COULDN'T BE INCREASED UPON WHEREAS NOWADAYS WE REALLY UNDERSTAND MAINLY THROUGH OUR DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF NERAL PLASTICITY AND HOW THE BRAIN LEARNS THAT INDEED THE BRAIN CAN LEARN AND THAT INTELLIGENCE IS NOT FIXED HOWEVER IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN THESE STUDIES WERE DONE MOST PEOPLE WERE OF THE CORPE BELIEF THAT INTELLIGENCE IS FIXED THAT IT CANNOT BE IMPROVED UPON AND THESE RESULTS REALLY DRIVE HOME THE FACT THAT THE TYPE OF FEED BACK WE GET ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE EVEN WHEN OUR PERFORMANCE IS GOOD CAN UNDERMINE OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR IF WE RECEIVE FEE BACK OF THE EFFORT PRAISED TYPE THOUGH YOU TRIED SO HARD YOU'RE SO PERSISTENT TYPE THAT OUR ABILITIES CAN INDEED IMPROVE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY INTELLIGENCE TEST IFYOU LOOK AT AR STANDARD I CUTEST OR YOU YOU'LL GO WAY OUT ONTO THE OTHER END OF THE CONTINUAL IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE TESSING YOU LOOK AT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT ANY ONE AN EVERY ONE CAN IMPROVE THEIR SCORES ON THOSE EXAMS AND IN FACT CAN IMPROVE THE VERIOUS ASPECTS OF INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE IN FACT THER ARE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE THROUGH DEDICATED EFFORT SO THIS PAPER WAS REALLY AHEAD OF ITS TIME AND IT'S REALLY WHAT SEEDED THE ENTIRE FIELD OF GROWTH MINE SET AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT IS SO NOW I'D LIKE TO SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO NOT JUST HOW GETTING ONE FORM OF PRAISE OR ANOTHER FORM OF PRAISE CAN DIMINISH OR ENHANSE PERFORMANCE BUT REALLY TO AN ASK WHY THAT WOULD BE HOW THAT IS BECAUSE IN THAT UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A VERY SIMPLE SET OF TOOLS OF NARRATIVES THAT YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF WERE THAT YOU CAN TELL A CHILD AS THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO LEARN THAT CAN GREATLY ENHANCE YOUR OR THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER HOWEVER I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE LISTENING TO THIS WITH AN I TOWARD THE TOOLS MEANING YOU ONT TO KNOW WHAT THE TOOLS ARE THAT YOU CAN IMPLEMENT WHELL EARLIER I HAD YOU ASK SOME QUESTIONS WHAT YOU GOOD AT WHAT IF YOU BEEN TOLD YOUR GOOD AT AND HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT BEING GOOD AT THOSE THINGS I ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU BEEN TOLD YOUR BAT AT OR LESS GOOD AT AND WHAT YOU TELL YOURSELF YOUR BAD AT AND LESS GOOD AT AND HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THAT CONCLUSION RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE YOU TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT IS YOUR TYPICAL NARRATIVE WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGING IN THINGS THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE GOOD AT AND WHAT IS YOUR TYPICAL NARRATIVE MEANING YOUR INTERNAL DIALOGUE IN YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGING IN THINGS THAT YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT OR I YOU'RE NOT ENGAGING IN THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ENGAGING IN THOSE THINGS AND THE TOOL THAT'S VERY EFFECTIVE TO APPLY EVEN JUST IN YOUR OWN MIND IS TO START SHIFTING YOUR NARRATIVE FROM THOSE PERFORMANCE NARRATIVES OF BEING REALLY GOOD AT SOMETHING OR BAD AT SOMETHING WHICH ARE IN FAIRNESS ARE THE LABELS I'M USING HERE BUT THAT'S FOR SAKE OF DISCUSSION AND CLARITY AND TO START TO SHIFT  THOSE NARRATIVES TOWARDS EFFORT RELATED NARRATIVES SALL USE MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE I'M PRETTY GOOD AT LEARNING AND REMEMBERING THINGS COGNITIVE INFORMATION I'M PRETTY TERRIBLE AT PLAYING MUSIC IN FACT I'M DOWNRIGHT TERRIBLE IF I WERE TO STEP BACK FROM THOSE TWO STATEMENTS I COULD TAKE AN INTELLIGENCE TYPE PRAISE NARRATIVE AND TELL MYSELF O K I'M UM I HAVE A GREAT MEMORY RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S A INTELLIGENCE PRAISE TYPE NARRATIVE OR I COULD TELL MYSELF THE TRUTH WHICH IS I TEND TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH INFORMATION IN DIFFERENT FORMS I LISTEN TO IT I READ IT I WRITE IT DOWN I HIGH LIGHT IT I PUT IT UP ON A WHITEBOARD I TELL MYSELF THAT INFORMATION AGAIN IN MY HEAD I THINK ABOUT IT IN DIFFERENT CONTECTS I TELL OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT IT THAT'S HOW I DEVELOPED A GOOD MEMORY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF INFORMATION AND THAT STILL HOW I CONTINUE TO BUILD MY MEMORY AND MY INFORMATION BANK IN MY HEAD TO THIS DAY IT'S NOT BECAUSE I HAVE A QUOTIN QGREAT MEMORY IT'S BECAUSE I ENGAGE IN CERTAIN VERB PROCESSES TO BUILD UP THAT MEMORY K I CAN ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE THAT'S CALLED THE NEGATIVE STATEMENT I AM A BISMAL AT MUSIC WHICH FRANKLY AS A FAIR STATEMENT AND I COULD SAY O K I'M JUST A TERRIBLE MUSICIAN I HAVE NO MUSICAL SENSE I'VE NO MUSICAL ABILITY THOSE ARE LABELS OF THE INTELLIGENCE TYPE LABELS OR I COULD LOOK AT THE VERBS THIS IS ALSO TRUE IAVE NEVER REALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO LEARN AN INSTRUMENT I FAILED EARLY ON AT LEAST IN MY MIND I FAILED TO GET THE RESULTS I WANTED AND SO I STOPPED PLAYING I MADE THE DOG NEXT DOOR HOWL WHICH BY THE WAY I DID SO I STOP PLAYING I CEASED THE EFFORT PROCESS AND SO IN LOOKING AT IT THROUGH THAT LENDS YES I'M A TERRIBLE MUSICIAN BUT I'M A TERRIBLE MUSICIAN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING NEVER REALLY ENGAGED IN THE TYPES OF BEHAVIORS AND EFFORT OVER TIME THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ME TO BE ANYTHING BUT A TERRIBLE MUSICIAN NOW I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO DO THIS EXERCISE SIMPLY AS A WAY TO PUFF YOURSELF UP ABOUT THE THINGS YOU'RE GOOD AT AND REWARD YOURSELF FOR ALL THE EFFORT THAT WENT INTO IT NOR AM I ASKING YOU TO LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT AND TRING TO TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE SHAME AND BLAME ALTHOUGHTHAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING AS WELL THAT LED TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT THESE THINGS THE REASON I'M REQUESTING THAT YOU ASK THOSE QUESTIONS OF YOURSELF IS THAT THEY CAN START TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE ACTUAL TOOLS AND HOW THOSE TOOLS ARE IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO GET BETTER AT THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO GET BETTER AT AND AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND TO NOT SET YOURSELF UP FOR GETTING WORSE AT THE THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY THINK YOU'RE GOOD AT BECAUSE AS WELL SOON TALK ABOUT WHEN WE ATTACH PERFORMANCE LABELS TO THINGS THAT WE ARE REALLY GOOD AT WE INTERNALIZE THAT SENSE OF SELF I'M GOOD AT THIS PARTICULAR THING IN MY CASE IF I GAVE A PEFORMANCE LABEL OR AN INTELLIGENCE LABEL IT WOULD BE OF THE SORT O CAY HAVE A GREAT MEMORY BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOME ONE GIVES THEMSELVES OR HEARS OF PERFORMANCE OR INTELLIGENCE LABEL AROUND SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE GOOD AT AND THEN HAS AN ERROR OR HAS A PERIOD WHERE THEY'RE NOT THAT GOOD AT SOMETHING WELL IF YOU INTERNALIZED A SENSE OF IDENTITY AROUND PERFORMING WELL AT THAT THING AND THEN AT SOME POINT YOU DON'T PERFORM WELL YOU WILL ALSO ATTACH YOUR IDENTITY TO THAT DIMINISHED PERFORMANCE WHEREAS IF YOU ATTACH EFFORT VERBS TO WHY YOU GOT GOOD AT SOMETHING AS WELL AS WHY YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT SOMETHING WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WHY DO I SAY THAT WELL WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EFFORT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERBS THAT IS INHERENT TO YOU IF YOU DID IT IN ONE CONTEXT YOU CAN DO IT IN ANOTHER WHEREAS ABILITY AND PERFORMANCE IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT IF YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY YOU ARE BY DEFAULT A GOOD MUSICIAN THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE BUT IN MY CASE CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THE POINT BEING THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE EFFORT PROCESSES THAT YOU'VE ENGAGED BEFORE AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CONTINUE TO GET BETTER IN A GIVEN DOMAIN EVEN WHEN OR PERHAPS WE SHOULD SAY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU STOP GETTING THE RESULTS YOU WANT OR YOU START GETTING POOR RESULTS AND THAT EFFORT PROCESS OF PRACTICING A OT MANY REPETITIONS ANALYZING WHY YOU DIDN'T GET SOMETHING RIGHT THAT CAN BE ENGAGE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ENDEAVORS A CROSS DOMAINS AS WE SAY SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT VERBS LIKE EFFORT OR PERSISTENCE OR PRACTISING A LOT OR ANALYZING ERRORS AND WHY YOU DID SOMETHING IN CORRECTLY AND THEN GETTING BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AS IT'S CALLED WHEN YOU START TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SUCCESS IS IN YOUR FAILURES THROUGH THOSE LENSES THROUGH THE LENS OF VERBS THEN YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT CENTRAL TO WHO YOU ARE IT'S HOW YOU'RE WIRED IT'S MACHINERY THAT EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BODY THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE THAT TIME AND ANY TIME AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING A G ONE DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSERING THE POD CAST A G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT'S DESIGNED TO ME ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS OF COURSE I TRY TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF VITEMENS AND MINERALS THROUGH WHOLE FOOD SOURCES THAT INCLUDE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS EVERY DAY BUT OFTENTIMES I SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH SERVINGS BUT WITH A G ONE I'M SURE TO GET ENOUGH VITEMENS AND MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED END IT ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTAGENS TO HELP BUFFER STRESS SIMPLY PUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I TAKE A G ONE I HAVE MORE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND I SLEEP BETTER AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO TASTE GRIGHT FOR ALL THESE REASONS WHENEVER I'M ASKED IF YOU COULD TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT WOULD IT BE I ANSWER A G ONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY AG ONE GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER FROM NOW UNTIL AUGUST TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY THREE A G ONE IS GIVING AWAY TEN FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUTS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE  TO AGAIN IF YOU GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN YOU CAN CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF TEN FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUTS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THRE K TO O CASESO I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT COGNITIVE OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSIES AND THE BASIC TAK HOME IS THAT LABELS OF INTELLIGENCE LABELS OF IDENTITY UNDERMINE PERFORMANCE AND A STRIKING ASPECT OF THAT BY THE WAY WHICH I FAIL TO MENTION EARLIER BUT I SHOULD HAVE IS THAT IF WE RECEIVE THOSE LABELS OF BEING A HIGH PERFORMER SMART TALENTED ET CETERA EITHER BEFOR OR AFTEOR A GIVEN TASK OR GAME OR EXAM IT' STILL HAS A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT IN BOTH CASES MEANING YOU TELL SOME ONE HEADING INTO SOMETHING YOU ARE A GREAT ATHLET YOU ARE SO SMART YOU'RE GING TO DO SO WELL ON THIS EXAM YOU UNDERMINE THEIR PERFORMANCE OR IF THEY TAKE THE EXAM AND AFTERWARDS BEFORE YOU SEE THEIR SCORES OR EVEN AFTER THE SCORE LET'S SAY THEY GET AN A PLOTS THEY GET EVERYTHING PERFECT AND YOU SAY YU ARE SO SMART YOU ARE SO TALENTED YOU ARE UNDERMINING THEIR PERFORMANCE ON THE NEXT EXAM THAT'S HOW STRIKING THESE RESULTS ARE AND AGAIN THEYVE BEEN SHOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS AND ADULTS CONVERSELY IT'S STRIKING HOW POWERFUL THE EFFORT ABELS CAN BE AT IMPROVING PERFORMANCE CONVERSELY AND FORTUNATELY THE SAME IS TRUE FOR EFFORT BASE PRAISE SO IF BEFORE A KID OR ADULT HEADS INTO A COMPETITION OR EXAM OR PREPARATION FOR A COMPETITION AND EXAM YOU SAY KNOW IT I KNOW YOU TO BE A REALLY DEDICATED WORKER YOU REALLY PERSIST YOU KNOW HOW TO DO HARD THINGS YOU REALLY DIG YOUR HEELS WHEN IT GETS HARD AND YOU OVERCOME CHALLENGES IF YOU DO THAT BE FOR THAT CHILD OR ADULT HEADS INTO CHALLENGE THEY WILL PERFORM BETTER AND IF AFTER AN EXAMER PERFORMANCE OR PRACTICE WHATEVER THE EFFORT HAPPENS TO BE YOU TELL THEM YOU REALLY WORKED HARD I LOVE THE WAY THAT EVEN WHEN YOU KNOW YOU GOT KICKED IN THE CHIN AND YOU'R LIMPING ALONG THERE AND YOUR HURT YOU CONTINUED TO PLAY OR EVEN WHEN YOU KNOW EVERYONE ELSE WHENT TO SLEEP AND YOU CONTINUE TO STUDY ALTHOUGH BY THE WAY I DO INCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ET ENOUGH SLEEP THERE ARE TIMES IN WHICH LET'S FACE IT THE PERSON WHO STAYS UP LATE A STUDYING PROVIDE THEY GET ENOUGH SLEEP THEY ARE GETTING THE EXTRA HOURS AND RIGHT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT KIT IN COLLEGE OR TRYED TO BE THAT KITD IN COLLEGE IF YOU REWARD EFFORT AFTER THE EFFORT YOU ALSO SET THE MIND THE BRAIN OF THAT CHILD OR ADULT UP TO PROVIDE MORE EFFORT TO FUTUR R ENDEAVORS SO IT'S VERY CLEAR DOESN'T MATTER IF THE TIMING OF THE PRAISE COMES BEFORE OR AFTER A GIVEN DOUBT OF EFFORT OR PERFORMANCE YOU GIVE IDENTITY PRAISE BEFORE PERFORMANCE DIMINISHES YOU GIVE IDENTITY PRAISE AFTER SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE DIMINISHES YOU GIVE EFFORT PRAISE BEFORE PERFORMANCE GOES UP YOU GIVE EFFORT PRAISE AFTER PERFORMANCE GOES UP SO I KNOW I SOUND A LOWBIT LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT WE HEAR SO OFTEN ABOUT GROWTH MINE SAID ABOUT GIVING THE RIGHT FORM OF PRAISE BUT IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT WE ARE TOLD WHEN TO GIVE THAT PRAISE AND THE SHORT ANSWER OF COURSE IS DOESN'T MATTER IN FACT WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE STRIVING TO GIVE OTHERS AND OURSELVES PRAISE THAT IS CORRECTLY ATTACHED TO GENUINE EFFORT AND THAT WORD CORRECTLY IS IMPORTANT HERE I'M NOT SAYING YOU NON TAKE A KID WHO PERFORMD POORLY ON AXAM BECAUSE THEY CAN LOAFT OR THE KID THAT WAS JUST SHUFFLING THEIR FEET OUT ON THE SOKRAFIELDS EH GRAY YOU KNOW YOU YOU WORK SO HARD WHEN THEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE BEING LIED TO WERE WHEN WE'RE LYING TO OURSELVES BUT THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A SENSE OF CONTROL NOT A SENSE OF LACK OF CONTROL BECAUSE ULTIMATELY EFFORT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTROL IN FACT WHENEVER I HEAR THE TERM CONTROL WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL I GET A LITTLE BIT NAUSEATED AND A LITTLE B IRRITATED TO BECAUSE IT'S NEVER CLEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE REFERRING TO WHEN THEY SAY CNTROL WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CON CONTROL WHAT'S THE THING THAT WE ALL REALLY CAN CONTROL IT'S OUR LEVEL OF PERSISTENCE AND OUR LEVEL OF EFFORT AND OF COURSE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH THAT PERSISTENCE IND EFFORT CAN BE HARDER IN CERTAIN CERCUMSTANCES AND FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE CERTAINLY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND AT THE END OF OUR LIFE REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT YU REALLY TRULY CAN CONTROL IS WHERE YOU PLACE YOUR ATTENTION AND WHERE YOU PLACE YOUR EFFORT THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT ARE REALLY INHERIT TO YOU AND YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM NO ONE CAN DO THE EFFORT FOR US NO ONE CAN DIRECT OUR ATTENTION FOR US THINGS AN PEOPLE CAN TRY AND DIVERT OR DISTRACT OUR ATTENTION AND OUR R EFFORT BUT ULTIMATELY EFFORT AND ATTENTION THAT IS INTRINSIC MOTIVATION COME AS THE NAME SUGGESTS DIRECTLY FROM US O CASEO IT'S CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A STRIKING SET OF RESULTS IN THE LITERATURE AND AGAIN MAJOR HAT TIP TO CARROLL DUECK AN HER COLLEAGUES FOR MAKING THIS DISCOVERY RIGHT IT IS WHAT EVENTUALLY LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF GROWTH MIND SET AND IT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY BUILDING UP TO HERE O CASE O THIS EARLY WORK FROM DWACKEN COLLEAGUES AND BY EARLY I MEAN LATE NINETIES RIGHT IS REALLY SPECTACULAR IT REALLY TRANSFORM THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT EDUCATION AND LEARNING IN GENERAL AND INFACNORAL PLASTICITY BUT WHAT IT DIDN'T ANSWER IS WHY YOU KNOW WHY IS IT THAT EFFORT PRAISE LEADS TO BETTER PERFORMANCE AND INTELLIGENCE PRAISE IDENTITY PRAISE LEADS TO DIMINISH PERFORMANCE AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ANSWER RESIDES IN HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO ERRORS HOW THEY RESPOND TO FEED BACK THAT THEY DID NOT WANT AND THERE'S A REALLY NI STUDY THAT LOOKED AT THIS MECHANISTICALLY IN THE BRAIN TO ASK WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE HOOD ANDING WITHIN THE BRAIN WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONE MIND SET OR ANOTHER ADOPT A GROWTH MIND SET THAT IS THE IDEA THAT IF THEY ENGAGE AN EFFORT THAT THEY CAN GET BETTER AT THINGS OR IF THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A FIXED MIN SET THIS IDEA THAT IF THEY'RE NOT PERFORMING WELL IT MUST BE BECAUSE THEY JUST SIMPLY CAN'T PERFORM WHELE THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR THE ABILITY TO PERFORM WELL SO THE STUDY I'M REFERRING TO IS A STUDY FIRST AUTHOR MANGLES LASTD AUTHOR NO SURPRISE CARROLL DUEK AND IT'S ENTITLED WHY DO BELIEFS ABOUT INTELLIGENCE INFLUENCE LEARNING SUCCESS A SOCIAL COGNITIVE NERW SCIENCE MODEL I'M NOT COGOING TO ALL THE DETAILS OF THE STUDY BUT THE STUDY USED WHATS CALED E R PES A VENT RELATED POTENTIALS EVENT REALLY A POTENTIALS OR MEASURED BY PUTTING A CAP ON THE SKULL THA HAS A BUNCH OF ELECTRODES BUT THEY DON'T PENETRATE THE SKULL THEY'RE PICKING UP ELECTRICAL POTENTIALS THAT CORRELATE WITH SHIFTS IN BRAIN ACTIVITY NOW AN ADVANTAGE OF TE R PES IS THAT IT'S PRETTY NON INVASIVE ETHEMAN DO IT ON BABIES YOU DON'T HAVE TO CUT INTO THE SKULL YOU AFTER REMOVE ANY SKIN AS YOU WOULD IF YOU I WE'RE GOING TO YOU DO'T PUT ELECTROTES DOWN INTO THE BRAIN A WHICH ESSENTIALY IS NER A SURGERY AND IT'S NOT AS DISRUPTIVE AS BEING PUT IN TO A FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC IMAGING MACHINE WHERE YOU'RE PUT INTO A TUBE AND YOU HAVE TO LIE MOTIONLESS FOR AN HOUR OR MORE ACTUALLY WAS IN IT EMORI MACHINE NOT FOR ANY CLINICAL REASON BUT JUST AS A DIAGNOSTIC SCAN RECENTLY AND NOWADAYS THEY ALLOW YOU TO WATCH NET FLICKS IN THERE DO SOMETHING BUT YOU HAVE TO STAY VERY VERY STILL SO IT'S HARD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DO THAT BUT IT CAN BE DONE YOU NEEDED TO BE DONE YOU DO IT BUT E ARE PEAS ARE GREAT BECAUS PEOPLE CAN COME INTO THE LABORATORY PUT ON THIS SKULL CAP SCAN THIS FUNNY THING OR IT LOOKS FUNNY WITH ALL THES WIRES COMING OUT OF IT AND YOU CAN GET A FAIRLY GOOD MEASURE OF GLOBAL LEVELS OF ACTIVITY ACROSS THE BRAIN YOU CAN'T REALLY PIN POINT FINE STRUCTURES AND YOU CAN'T LOOK AT BRAIN ACTIVITY DEEP IN THE BRAIN THAT'S PROBABLY THE MAJOR DRAWBACK OF LOOKING ATHEASY AR PEAS BUT YOU CAN SEE GLOBAL SHIFTS AND ACTIVITY ACROSS THE BRAIN AND THE OTHER ADVANTAGE IS YOU CAN DO THAT WHILE PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TASSS THYOU CAN MOVE AROUND A LOT WHEREAS WHEN YOU'RE IN AN EMORI MACHINERY IN THAT LITTLE TUBE YOU CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH SO THIS STUDY HAD PEOPLE EQUIPPED WITH THESE SKULL CAPS LOOKS LIKE A COME LIKE A HOODIE WITH A BUNCH OF WIRES COMING OUT OF IT AND THEY HAD THEM PLAY A GAME BASICALLY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY WERE ASKED QUESTIONS ES ER TRIVIATYPE QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT'S THE CAPITAL OF AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIANS YOURE NO ALLOW T ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD TRY AND THEN HERE ON PARAPHRASING PEOPLE INDICATED THEIR CONFIDENCE IN HOW ACCURATE THEY WERE WITH A RESPONSE OCH SO HYASKE HIM A QUESTION LIKE WHAT'S A CAPITAL OF AUSTRALIA THE PERSON WOULD ANSWER AND THEN THEY SAY HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU ON A SCALE OF SAY ONE TO TEN THAT YOU GOT THE ANSWER CORRECT AND THEN THEY WERE GIVEN TWO PIECES OF FEED BACK AND THE FIRST PIECE OF FEE BACK PROVIDED INFORMATION ONLY ABOUT THEIR RESPONSE ACCURACY WERE THEY RIGHT OR WERE THEY NOT RIGHT AND THEN THE SECOND FEED BACK WAS THEY GOT THE CORRECT ANSWER SO THIS IS A PRETTY CLEVER EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN BECAUSE IT ALLOWED THE RESEARCHERS TO LOOK AT PEOPLES THINKING AS THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE RIGHT ANSWER THEN COMPARE THAT TO HOW CONFIDENT THEY WERE THAT THEY HAD THE RIGHT ANSWER T YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT IF SOME ONE WAS REALLY CONFIDENT LIKE YOU YOU ASKED ME WHAT'S YOUR NAME AND I SAY ANDREW WHAT'S MY CONFIDENCE THAT AH MY NAME IS ANDREW SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT JUST GETTING ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT WHEREAS IF YOU ASKED ME UM I WAS CONFRONTED THIS THE OTHER DAY AH IN YOUR PHYSIC'S CLASS WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT THE RIGHT HAND RULE WHICH IS IF YOU'RE LISTENING DON'T DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT JUST WHEN YOU PUT OUT YOUR A INDEX FINGER YOUR MIDDLE FINGER IN YOUR THUMB WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND IN THE RIGHT HAND RULE IS THE MAGNETIC FIELD THE THE MIDDLE FINGER THE INDEX FINGER THE THUMB AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IT'S A PRETTY SURE THAT IT'S THE THE MAGNETIC FEELD IS THE THE MIDDLE FINGER THAT'S THE VECTOR OF THE MIDDLE FINGER AH BUT HOW CONFIDENT AM I IN THIS RESULT I DON'T KNO MAY BE FIFTY PER CENT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE LOOKED AT THE STUFF AND I SHOULD KNOW THIS BUT I HAVEN'T LOOKED ATSO FIFTY PER CENT WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS WHILE RECORDING BRAIN ACTIVITY YOU'RE GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION YOU'RE LOOKING AT ACCURACY YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING AT CONFIDENCE YOU'RELOOKING AT LACK OF CONFIDENCE AND YOU CAN CORRELATE THAT WITH DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY NOW THEY HAD ESSENTIALLY TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN THE STUDY ONE GROUP HAD AN INTELLIGENCE MIND SET THEY BLIEVED INTELLIGENCE WAS MORE OR LESS FIXED THE OTHER HAD WHAT WE CALL GROWTH MINES THAID THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH EFFORT THAT INTELLIGENCE WAS MALLUABLE THAT PEOPLE COULD LEARN NEW INFORMATION INCLUDING THEMSELVES THEY COULD LEARN NOW INFORMATION AND YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT THESE TWO GROUPS WOULD SHOW DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY IN RESPONSE TO GETTING THINGS RIGHT OR WRONG WHILE THE BRAIN WAS BEING IMAGE BUT IN FACT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THERE'S A CERTAIN WAVE FORM OF ACTIVITY THE NAME ISN'T REALLY INFORMADY CALL IT THE P THREE WAVE IN THESE ARP EXPERIMENTS PETHREE WAVE IS A CERTAIN PATTERN OF ACTIVITY THAT EMERGED JURING THE PRESENTATION TO THE SUBJECT THAT THEY GOTTEN SOMETHING WRONG SO THE P THREE WAVE ITS JUST A LITTLE BLIP IN NURAL ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN CORRELATED WITH WHEN PEOPLE WERE TOLD NOPE YOU GOT THAT ONE WRONG AND WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE P THREE THIS LET'S JUST CALLED IN ARROR SIGNAL CAUS IT CORRELATED WITH THE AIROR SIGNAL THIS NOPE YOU GOT IT WRONG SIGNAL IN THE BRAIN THAT SIGNAL WAS LARGER IN PEOPLE WITH A FIXED MIND SET AS OPPOSED TO IN PEOPLE WITH THE GROWTH MIND SET NOW WHAT WAS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING IS THAT THE LOCATION OF THAT ACTIVITY WAS ABOVE A BRAIN AREA CALLED THE INTERIOR SINGULA QUARTEX THE A C C THE ENTER SINGULA QUARTEX IS A STRUCTURE INVOLVED IN MANY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN THE BRAIN BUT ONE OF ITS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IS THAT IN THE FRONT OF THE A C C WHAT WE CALLED THE ROSTRIL OR ANTERIOR A C C ACTIVITY THERE TENDS TO CORRELATE WITH EMOTIONAL RESPONSES IT TENDS TO CORRELATE WITH OUR INTERNAL SENSE SO CALLED IN TERROCEPTION WHEREAS IN THE DORSAL A C C MEAN THE TOP OF THE A C C ACTIVITY THERE TENDS TO CORRELATE WITH COGNITIVE INFORMATION AND COGNITIVE APPRASAL MEANING THIS STRUCTURE HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS BUT IT'S GOT A LITTLE AREA WITHIN IT THAT TENDS TO BE MORE RELATED TO OUR EMOTIONAL OR SOMMATIC RESPONSAS TO THINGS AND IT'S GOT ANOTHER AREA INSIDE OF IT THE TENSIMY WAR RELATED TO OUR THINKING OUR COGNITION AND WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT IN THE GROUP THAT HAD THE FIXED MIND SET WHEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY GOT SOMETHING WRONG THEIRE TENDED TO BE A GREATER SIGNAL IN THAT ROSTRIL OR ANTEROR A C C MEANING THEY HAD A BIGGER EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO IT OR AT LEAST THE NURAL ACTIVITY SUGGESTED THAT WHEREAS PEOPLE WITH A GROWTH MIND SET WHEN PRESENTED WITH N YOU GOT SOMETHING WRONG THE ERROR SIGNAL THE ERROR SIGNAL WITHIN THEIR BRAIN TENDED TO RESIDE OR EVEN TO SHIFT TOWARD AREAS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIV APPRASAL AND SO THE CONCLUSION OF THIS STUDY AS WELL AS OTHER STUDIES USING FUNCTIONAL MAG NETIC RESONENCE IMAGING THAT HAVE LOOKED AT SIMILAR TASKS IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A GROWTH MIND SET AND THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEY GOT SOMETHING WRONG RATHER THAN JUST FEEL IT AS A SOMATIC RESPONSE OR AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE THEY TEND TO APPRAISE IT THEY TEND TO DIRECT THEIR ATTENTIONAL RESOURCES TOWARD TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ERROR WAS AND WHY THEY GOT THAT ERROR AND THIS I BELIEVE IS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A FIXED MIND SET AND A GROWTH MIND SET BECAUSE PERHAPS YOU'VE SEEN THESE LISTS THESE O SIDE BY SIDE LISTS THAT NO FIXED MIND SET VERSE IS A GROWTH MIND SET YOUW FIXED MIND SET IS ONE IN WHICH YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK SMART THAT YOU'RE NOT SO FOCUED ON EFFORT THAT YOUR RESPONSE TO SET BAXES TO GIVE UP YOU KNOW AND YOUR ACADEMIC AND OTHER FORMS OF PERFORMANCE TENDS TO BE LOW WHEREAS IN A GROWTH MIND SET YOURE GOALD TENDS TO BE TO LEARN YOU TEND TO VALUE EFFORT MORE YOU TEND A RESPOND TO SET BACKS BY WORKING HARDER AND YOUR PERFORMANCE IS HIGHER AND I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT OF THESE LISTS THESE LISTS AR IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HELP US ORGANIZE OUR INFORMATION AND DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A FIXED VERSES GROWTH MIND SET BUT THEY DON'T TELL US WHY FOCUSSING ON EFFORT AND ENGAGING MORE EFFORT WOULD ACTUALLY TRANSLATE INTO HIGHER PERFORMANCE FOR INSTANCE YOU COULD IMAGINEASON AREO WHERE THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS TRUE RIGHT WE COULD MAKE UP A JUST SO STORY WHERE IF YOUR IDENTITY IS SO RIGIDLY FIXED TO HIGH PERFORMANCE YOU'RE LIKELY TO OUTWORK EVERYBODY THAT SEEMS LIKE A WLOGICAL CONCLUSION AS WELL BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT PLAYS OUT IT'S WHEN YOUR IDENTITY IS ATTACHED TO YOUR SENSE OF ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ONGOING EFFORT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE SIGNALS THAT YOUR GETTING THINGS WRONG OR NOT PERFORMING WELL THAT IS TIE TO ELEVATE IT PERFORMANCE AND THE STUDY USING ARPEAS TELLS US THAT'S LIKELY TO BE THE CASE BECAUSE OF HOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GROWTH MIND SET FOCUSS THEIR ATTENTION WHEN THEI'RE TOLD NOPE YOU GOT THAT WRONG OR WHEN PEOPLE THINK THEY GOT SOMETHING RIGHT I THEY GIVE AN ANSWER AND THEY SAY WHAT'S YOUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL THEY SAY NINETY PER CENT MAY NINETY NINE PERS TIT MADE EVEN A HUNDRPER SET IT'S WRONG PEOPLE WO HAVE A FIED MIND SET FOCUS ON THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO THAT MORE OF THEIR BRAIN RESOURCES ARE DEVOTED TO AH I GOT IT WRONG I THOUGHT I GOT IT RIGHT THEN THE PEOPLE HAVE A GROWTH MIND SET WHO ARE THINKING WAI O K THEN WHAT WAS THAT ANSWER AND HOW COULD I POSSIBLY GET THAT ANSWER WRONG I'M GOING TO FIGURE THAT OUT  NOW AS YOU'R HEARING THIS YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING OH NO I'M SOMEBODY WHO REFLECTIVELY GETS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I GET SOMETHING WRONG WELL FORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THAT HUNDRED MILL SECONDS TO FIVE SECONDS AFTER YOU'RE TOLD SOMETHING IS WRONG YOU CAN SHIFT FROM A FIXED MIND SET TO A GROWTH MIND SET RESPONSE IN FACT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT WE ALL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO IMPLEMENT WE ALL SUFFER FROM FIXED MIND SET ALL SUFFER FROM FIXED MIND SET IN CERTAIN ENDEAVORS AND WHEN WE GET THINGS WRONG ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE SOME EMBARRASSMENT OR SHAME WHICH OFTEN ACCOMPANIES WHEN WE THINK WE WERE VERY RIGHT WERE CONVINCED WE'RE RIGHT THAT FIXED MIN SET CAN REALLY HIGH JACK OUR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS IF WE THINK OK I'MN A STEP BACK FROM THAT AND OM JUST THINK ABOUT THE ERROR I'M A THINK ABOUT WHAT LED TO THE ERROR AND I'MUST START DEVOTING MY ATTENTIONAL RESOURCES TO THAT PROCESS THAT PROCESS ITSELF CAN BE BUILT UP OVER TIME SUCH THAT WE START TO OUT WAY THE FIXED MIN SET WITH GROWTH MIND SET SIMPLY BY DEVOTING OUR ATTENTIONAL RESOURCES TO THE ERROR ACKNOWLEDGING IT HAPPENED MAYBE FEELING SOMETHING ABOUT IT MAY BE NOT IT'S REALLY HARD TO CONTROL OUR FEELINGS WHAT WE CAN CONTROL AS I MENTION BEFORE IS OUR EFFORT IN OUR ATTENTION SO FOCUSSING OUR ATTENTION ON WHY WE GOT SOMETHING WRONG AND REALLY DIGGING INTO THAT THAT'S GROWTH MIND SET IN ACTION SO YOU'LL NOTICE AS WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MORE MECHANISTIC UNDER PINNINGS OF GROWTH MINE SET IS THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS AS MUCH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT EGO PROTECTION WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IDENTITY NOW ALL THOSE THINGS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THINGS LIKE EGO PROTECTION AND IDENTITY IS THAT WHEN WE ARE FACED WITH RESULTS THAT WE DON'T WANT AND WE ARE FACED WITH THOSE RESULTS IN A REAL WORLD CONTEXTS WE'RE NOT GETTING THE RESULTS WE WANT IN SCHOOL IN WORK IN ATHLETICS IN RELATIONSHIPS ET CETERA WE HEAR O THESE MESSAGES AND WE TRY TO FOR INSTANCE YOUT SET OUR EGO ASIDE OR YOU KNOW NOT ATTACH OUR IDENTITY SO MUCH I TO WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD AND IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD BECAUSE STATEMENTS LIKE SET YOUR EGO ASIDE OR DON'T ATTACH YOURSELF TO IT SO MUCH ORE WONDERFUL ASPIRATIONS BUT THERE'S NO ACTUAL PROCESS THAT ONE CAN GO THROUGH BY ONES SELF THAT ALLOWS YOU TO IMMEDIATELY DISENTANGLE YOURSELF FROM YOUR EGO RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF EGO DISOLUTION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE EPISODE WITH ROBIN CARDART HARRIS BUT NONE OF THAT WAS DIRECTED AT SPECIFIC CHALLENGES THAT ONE IS UNDERTAKING IN REAL TIME RIGHT SO WHEN YOU'RE FACED WITH RESULTS THAT YOU DON'T LIKE YOU CAN'T SIMPLY STEP BACK NOR SHOULD YOU EXPRECT YOURSELF TO BE ABLLE STEP BACK AND SAY OH I'M I'M NOT GONG TO GET UPSET ABOUT THIS ERRA RIGHT IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE WHY YOU WOULD GET UPSET ABOUT NOT GETTING THE RESULTS THAT YOU WANT HOWEVER ONCE YOU START TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE MECHANISTIC UNDERPINNINGS OF WHAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO RESCUE YOUR PERFORMANCE THAT IS TO START FOCUSING ON THOSE ERRORS FROM A MORE COGNITIVE AND A SLIGHT LESS EMOTIONAL STANCE OR EVEN A COMMINATION OF EMOTIONAL AND COGNATIVE RIGHT BECAUSE VERY HARD TO SUPPRESS OUR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO SOMETHING BUT OFTENTIMES WE CAN ENHANCE OUR ATTENTIONAL OR COGNITIVE RESPONSE TO SOMETHING IN PARALLEL WITH THAT AND IN DOING SO WE CAN KIND OF ROB SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE AND WHEN WE DO THAT SORT OF THING IT'S HARD AND AIN'T TIME WE DO HARD THINGS WE GENERALLY WANT TO KNOW THAT THE DOING OF THOSE HARD THINGS IS WORKING THAT IT'S IN SERVICE TO SOMETHING AND THE STUDY I JUST REVIEWED AS WELL AS WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEXT REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT BUILDING UP A PRACTICE A CAPACITY OF FOCUSING ON ONE'S EFFORT ON FOCUSING ON THE ERRORS ONE MADE FROM A COGNATIVE STANDPOINT AND REALLY TRIN UNDERSTAND WHAT LED TO THOSE ERRORS IS THE BASIS IT'S THE CORNER STONE OF BUILDING UP GROWTH MINE SET IT DOES HOWEVER REQUIRE THAT WE DON'T JUST TELL OURSELVES TO FOCUS AW N EFFORT AND THE ERRORS AND ANALYZING THOSE ERRORS IT ALSO REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL PIECE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DONETO TALK ABOUT NOW I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKERS A PERSONALIZED NUTRITIAN PLATFORM THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDI AN E TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU MEET YOUR HEALTH GOALS I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THE IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TUST HOWEVER WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TUSTS OUT THERE YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT BLOOD LIPPITS ABOUT HORMONES AND SO ON BUT YOU DON'T KNOWHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WITH INSIDE TRACKR THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR DATA THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE LIPITS WHAT THOSE HORMONE LEVELS ET CETERA MEAN AND BEHAVIORAL SUPPLEMENT NUTRICIAN ANOTHER PROTOCALS TO ADJUST THOSE NUMBERS TO BRING THEM INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE IDEAL FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH INSIDE TRACKERS ULTIMATE PLAN NOW INCLUDES MEASURES OF BOTH APO B AND OF INSOLENT WHICH ARE KEY INDICATORS OF CARTYOFASCULAR HEALTH AND ENERGY REGULATION IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRAC INSIDE TRACKER YOU CAN VISIT INSIDE TRACKER DO COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACKERS PLANS AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKER DOT COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF O CASO BY NOW I LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT GROWTH MINE SET IS AND WHAT DIFFERENTIATES IT FROM A FIXED MINE SET HOWEVER JUST UNDERSTANDING WHAT GROWTH MINE SET IS AND HAVING A DESIRE TO IMPLEMENT IT END A BIT OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT TURNS OUT TO BE NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIONT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL PIECE THAT WE NEED TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT ADDITIONAL PIECE IS VERY STRAIGHTFOR IR TO UNDERSTAND IF WESUME OUT AND WE START TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT GROWTH MIN ND SET IS REALLY A WAY OF CONNECTING MOTIVATION TO COGNITION IT'S TAKING THIS THING THAT WE CALL MOTIVATION WHICH IS OF COURSE WHAT WE ALL WANT WE ALL WNT TO BE MOTIVATED WE ALL WANT TO BE EFFORT DRIVEN ET CETERA AND WE TAKE MOTIVATION AND WE TIE IT TO A SET OF SPECIFIC THOUGHTS OR THOUGHT PROCESSES THAT WE CAN CONTROL THAT IS FAR IN AWAY DIFFERENT THAN LOOKING AT MOTIVATION SIMPLY AS AN EMOTIONAL OR ANINTERNAL STATE OF QUOTINFEELING MOTIVATED AND IN FACT THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF DEFAULT TO WE WANT A FEEL MOTIVATEDT SO FORTUNATELY WE TRY AND GET GOOD SLEEP WHICH IS ESSENTIAL THAT REALY HELPS FOR DAYTIME MOOD FOCUS AN ALERTNESS AND THEREBY MOTIVATION WE HYDRATE WE EXERCISE WE MIGHT EVEN DRINK KAFFINE AS A WAY TO INCREASE OUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND MOTIVATION AND ALL OF THAT IS FINING GOOD IN FACT ALL F THAT IS ENCOURAGED ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT THE KAFFINE PART IS OPTIONAL BUT ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS ARE ENCOURAGED TOWARD MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE AND MOTIVATION BUT WHAT GROWTH MINDS TAIT IS REALLY ABOUT IS ITS TAKING THIS THING THAT WE CALL MOTIVATION AND IT'S SAYING O KE WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF THOUGHTS AND ACTUALLY THE SPECIFIC THOUGHTS THE SPECIFIC COGNITIVE PROCESSES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO FEEL MORE MOTIVATED ESPECIALLY UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE WE FEEL SOMETHING AS HARD WHERE WE ARE NOT GETTING THE RESULTS WE WANT AND IN ORDER TO MASTER THAT PROCESS WE NEED TO EMBRACE ANOTHER MIND SET THAT'S RIGHT IN ORDER TO ACCESS GROWTH MIND SET IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT ERRORS AND WE NEED TO OVERCOME ERRORS AND WE NEED TO DEVOTE OUR ATTENTION TO ERRORS AND WE NEED TO DEVOTE OUR ATTENTION TO REFRAMING WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR HEAD WHEN WE'RE FEELING NOT MOTIVATED ET CETERA AND ALL O THAT IS REALLY HARD TO DO FROM A PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL STANDPOINT BUT THERE'S THIS ADDITIONAL MIND SET WHICH HAS TO DO WITH OUR MIND SET AROUND STRESS AND FRUSTRATION ITSELF THAT CAN ALLOW US TO ACCESS GROWTH MIND SET FAR MORE EASILY AND THIS MIND SET AROUND STRASS ACTUALLY HAS A AIM IT'S CALLED THE STRESS IS ENHANCING MIND SET AND THERE'S A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TO INCREASE YOUR STRESS IS ENHANCING MIND SET SO FOR SO ON A STEP BACK AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERSON WHO REALLY MADE SOME OF THE KEY FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERIES IN THIS AREA THAT WE CALL STRESSES ENHANCING MINE SETS AND THAT'S DOCTOR ALEA SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS DOCTOR ALLY CRUM SHE'S A TENURED PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT STAMFORD SHE ALSO'S A FORMER DIVISION ONE ATHLETE AND A LICENSE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST SHE'S A ABSOLUTE PENAM AND I PROMISE YOU THAT SHE IS SO SUCCESSFUL IN ALL THOSE CATEGORIES BY WAY OF IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF EFFORT IN ADDITION TO THAT SHE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE AN INCREDIBLY KIND PERSON IN GENEROUS PERSON SHE WAS A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST PREVIOUSLY YOU CAN FIND THAT EPISODE IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS OR BY GOINGTO HUBERMAN LABDOCK COMMAN SIMPLY SEARCHING FOR MIND SET CRUM SEE ARE YOU M HER PERSONAL STORY AND HER WORK AND THE TOOL SHE OFFERS ARE ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR HOWEVER YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO THAT EPISODE JUST YET I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE TOOLS NOW AND I'M IN TO TALK ABOUT HOW USING THOSE TOOLS CAN ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS GROWTH MIND SET AND THEN I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE COMMINATION OF APPLYING A STRESSES ENHANCING MIN SET WITH A GROWTH MINE SET ACTS ENERGISTICALLY TO EVEN FURTHER IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN THE STRESSES ENHANCING MIN SET IS THE OUTGROWTH OF MANY DIFFERENT STUDIES AND NOT JUST FROM DOCTOR ALLYCRUM BUT FROM OTHERS AS WELL BUT FOR THE TIME BEING I WANT A FOCUS ON ONE PAPER IN WHICH DOCTOR CRUM WAS THE FIRST AUTHOR SO THIS WORK WAS DONE BEFORE SHE ARRIVED AT STAMFORD THE PAPER'S ENTITLED RETHINKING STRESS THE ROLL OF MINE SETS IN DETERMINING THE STRESS RESPONSE AND THE KEY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS PAPER IS THAT HOW WE THINK ABOUT STRESS IMPACTS HOW WE REACT TO STRESS SO MUCH SO IN FACT THAT WHAT THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE GIVEN EVEN JUST A SHORT TUTORIAL ABOUT SOME OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF STRESS ON LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE AND THEIR PHYSIOLOGY AND THEIR HEALTH THEY EXPERIENCE AL LOT OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF STRESS WHEN THEY ARE PUT INTO A STRESSFUL CIRCUMSTANCE CONVERSELY IF PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE ENHANCING ASPECTS OF STRESS THEN THOSE PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT WHEN THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH STRESS IN A LEARNING OR OTHER PERFORMANCE TYPE ENVIRONMANCE SO WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS NOT THE PLACIBO EFFECT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE ARE ALSO NOT TALKING ABOUT LYING TO PEOPLE IN ORDER TO SHIFT THEIR RESPONSE TO STRESS WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS TWO DIFFERENT CONDITIONS ONE CONDITION WHERE PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO INFORMATION THAT IS TRUE ABOUT HOW STRESS CAN DIMINISH PERFORMANCE AND ANOTHER CONDITION IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO INFORMATION THAT IS ALSO TRUE ABOUT HOW STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE NOW YOU MIGHT BE SAYING HOW CAN IT BE TRUE THAT STRESSES BOTH PERFORMANCE DIMINISHING AND STRESSES PERFORMANCE ENHANCING AND AH THEREIN LIES THE KEY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS PAPER IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU BELIEVE ABOUT STRESS IN FACT A DIFFERENT WAY TO UMBRELLA THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION IS TO SAY THAT HOW YOU THINK ABOUT STRESS IMPACTS THE STRESS RESPONSE IN PROFOUND WAYS SO THIS PAPER RETHINKING STRESS THE ROLL OF MINE SETS IN DETERMINING STRESS DID A VERY SIMPLE SET OF MANIPULATIONS THEY HAD PEOPLE IN ONE GROUP LISTEN TO A LECTURE THAT EFFECTIVELY WITH TITLED QUOTE THE EFFECTS OF STRESS ARE NEGATIVE AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED AND THAT LECTURE INCLUDED INFORMATION ABOUT HOW STRESS DIMINISHES PERFORMANCE AND HOW IT CAN DIMINISH HEALTH AND VITALITY LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE PRODUCTIVITY IT INCREASES UNCERTAINTY ET CETERA AN ALL F THAT INFORMATION IS TRUE A SEPARATE GROUP LISTEN TO A LECTURE ENTITLED QUOTE EXPERIENCING STRESS IMPROVES HEALTH AN VITALITY AND AGAIN THAT INFORMATION IS TRUE NOW I REALIZE THAT SOME OF YOU ARE PROBLY STILL ASKING HOW CAN IT BE THAT STRESS DIMINISHES HEALTH IN PERFORMANCE AND STRESS ALSO ENHANCES HEALTH IN PEFORMANCE AND THE ANSWER LIES IN TWO THINGS ONE THE LEVEL OF STRESS AND THEREFORE THE LEVEL OF RMONES THAT ARE RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO THAT STRESS THE DURATION OVER WHICH THE STRESS RESPONSE OCCURS BUT THE KEY VARIABLE HERE IS THAT OUR COGNITIVE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT STRESS DOES IMPACTS WHETHER OR NOT OUR PHYSIOLOGY GOES DOWN THE DIRECTION OF DIBILITATING OR ENHANCING EFFECTS OF STRESS C SO WE'VE GOT A CONDITION HERE WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING INFORMED VERY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT STRESS DOES IN ONE CASE IT'S THE STRESS IS BAD MESSAGE IN THE OTHER CASE ITS THE STRESS IS GOOD MESSAGE AND THERE RE MANY DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS WITHIN THIS PAPER BUT ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING ONES I BELIEVE IS WHERE THEY LOOKED AT WORK PERFORMANCE BOTH IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE OF WHAT THEY CALL SOFT TASKS SO THESE ARE SOMEWHAT EASIER TASS AS WELL AS HARD TASKS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GROUP THAT WAS GIVEN INFORMATION ABOUT HOW STRESS DIMINISHES PERFORMANCE IN THE SOFT TASKS C SO THE SOMEWHAT EASY TASK YOU DON'T SEE MUCH CHANGE IN THEIR PERFORMANCE AS YOU COMPARE THE BEFORE THE LEARNING ABOUT STRESSES DIMINISHING TO AFTER THE LEARNING WHEREAS THE PEOPLE WHO LEARN THAT STRESSES ENHANCING ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN WORK PERFORMANCE EVEN THOUGH THE CHALLENGE THAT THEIR FASING ISN'T THAT GREAT SO AGAIN WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT LEARNING THAT STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE BY PROVIDING PEOPLE TRUE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE CAN INCREASE PERFORMANCE EVEN IN THE CONTECTS OF STUFF THAT'S NOT THAT HARD NOT THAT STRESSFUL EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT PERFORMANCE ON TASKS THAT ARE CONSIDERED HARD AND YOU COMPARE THE STRESSES DIMINISHING GROUP MEANING THE GROUP THAT WAS TAUGHT THAT STRESSES DIMINISHING AND COMPARE THAT TO THE STRESSES ENHANCING GROUP YOU SEE A REALLY DIVERGENT RESPONSE THE PEOPLE THAT LEARN THAT STRESS DIMINISHES PERFORMANCE DID NOT IMPROVE AT ALL WHEREAS THE PEOPLE THAT LEARN THAT STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE ENHANCE THEIR PERFORMANCE SIGNIFICANTLY A KEEP IN MIND ALL THEY ARE DOING IS LEARNING THAT STRESS CAN ENHANCE THEIR PERFORMANCE AND THEN THEY'RE GIVEN THE TASK AND THEIR PERFORMING BETTER SO THAT'S PRETTY SPECTACULAR RIGHT THERE'S NO TRAINING SESSION THAT THEY WE NTIN DID THEY DIDN'T PRACTISE THESE ITEMS THAT THEY WERE BEING TESTED ON IN BETWEEN THEY WEREN'T GIVEN A BUNCH OF YOU KNOW DRILLS TO DO AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO DO IT THEY JUST HEARD ATUTORIAL ABOUT HOW STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE AND THAT I BELIEVE IS REMARKABLE BECAUSE WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT OUR COGNATE OF APPRAISAL ABOUT STRESS WHICH WE ALL ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE IN LIFE RIGHT ELEVATE AT HEARTRATE NARROWING O VISUAL FOCUS YOU KNOW SHIFTING OF BLOOD AWAY FROM THE PARIPERY ALL OF THES THINGS ARE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE STRESS RESPONSE THAT WE LEARN ESPECIALLY THIS DAY IN AGE CAUSE IT'S TALKED ABOUT A LOT IN POPULAR CULTURE THAT OH OU N ALL THESE MECHANISMS WERE PUT IN TO US IN ORDER FOR US TO GET AWAY FROM THE SABRE TOO TIGER OR THE OR THE LINE THAT'S TRYIN TO EAT US LET'S BE FAIR THE SRESS RESPONSE IS THERE FOR A LOT OF REASONS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF SABR TO TIGERS IND LIONS IV IN THIS KIND OF A STORY THAT WE MAKE UP THE STRESS RESPONSE IS INHARRENT NOT JUST TO US BUT TO OTHER SPECIES AS A WAY TO MOBILIZE US EITHER AWAY FROM THINGS OR TOARD THINGS RIGHT WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A STRESS RESPONSE IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN ADAPTIVE CHALLENGE YES IT'S TRUE THAT HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO THOSE ADAPTIVE CHALLENGES PROBABLY INVOLVED HUNTING BUT THEY PROBABLY INVOLVED SOCIAL CHALLENGES AS WELL DO YOU THINK IT WAS YOU KNOW EASY FOR CAVE MEN AND WOMEN TO ENGAGE SOCIALLY IN YOU DON'T CONE TO SETTLE OUT THEIR ROMANTIC INTERACTIONS ET CETERA DOYOU THINK IT WAS EASY FOR THEM TO RAISE CHILDREN KNOW OF COURSE NOT THE STRESS RESPONSEIS THERE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS NOT JUST TO GET AWAY FROM CREDITORS THE REALLY EXCITING THING THAT'S BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF ALYCRUM'S WORK AND OTHER WORK IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES IS THAT THE STRESS RESPONSE IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE STRESS RESPONSE DEPENDS ON WEATHER NOT YOU BELIEVE THE SENSATIONS THAT YOURE EXPERIENCING ELEVATED HEARTRATE NARROWING OVISUAL FOCUS ET CETERA ARE SERVING TO ENHANCE YOUR PERFORMANCE OR DIMINISH YOUR PERFORMANCE AND THIS STUDY REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT JUST LEARNING THAT IT CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE KEN ENHANE PERFORMANCE NOW I KNOW A NOW MER OF VIOUWOR PROBABLY SAYING WEIGHT BUT STRESS DUESN'T FEEL GOOD RIGHT AND OFTENTIMES WE EXPERIENCE STRESS UNDER CONDITIONS WER E WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN OR GET GOOD AT SOMETHING OR LISTEN BETTER OR DO SOMETHING AND IT ACTUALLY IS DIMINISHING PERFORMANCE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STUDY AND STUDIES LIKE IT ARE NOT SAYING THAT STRESS BECOMES PLEASANT AS A SENSATION IN THE BODY NORS IT SAYING THAT IT ALWAYS LEADS TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT'S TO TAKE O MESSAGE SOMETIMES IT DOES IT CAN AS WAS DEMONSTRATED IN THIS RESEARCH PAPER BUT OFTENTIMES AS WE KNOW STRESS DIMINISHES OUR PERFORMANCE IT TAKES US AWAY FROM THE LANDMARKS WE WANT A HIT IT TAKES US AWAY FROM THE GRADES WE WANT TO GET IT TAKES US AWAY FROM QUOT QO SHOWING UP HOW WE WANT TO RIGHT NO ONE WANTS TO HAVE THE BLOTCHY SKIN AND THE SWEATING AND THE QUAKING OF VOICE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO PUBLIC SPEAKING AND THINGS OF THAT SORT NO ONE WANTS ANY OF THAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT LEARNING THAT STRESS IS A WAY OF MOBILIZING RESOURCES IN THE BODY DOES TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT ALLOWS US TO DAMPIN OR ADJUST THE STRESS RESPONSE IN REAL TIME AND IT ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTIN THAT THAT STRESS RESPONSE HEIGHTENS OUR LEVEL OF FOCUS IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING WRONG IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE CORRECTION TO THOSE ERRORS IN THE FUTURE SO IF YOU THINK BACK TO THAT STUDY THAT E RP STUDY WHERE THEY MEASURED BRAIN ACTIVITY AND THEY LOOKED AT PEOPLE AT A FIXED MIND SET VERSES PEOPLE AT A GROWTH MIND SET AND THE PEOPLE HAD A GROWTH MIND SET WERE PAYING MORE COGNITIVE ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING DURING ERRORS AND AFTER ERRORS WELL THIS STRESSES ENHANCING MIND SET IS VERY POWERFUL BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS IT SHIFTS ONE'S ATTENTION AWAY FROM KIND OF SOMATIC EXPERIENCE OF OMIGANIS MY HEART RATE IS ELEVATEUM SWEATING A'MD QUAKING AND SOUND TERRIBLE I FEEL TERRIBLE I LOOK TERRIBLE ET CETERA TO A MODE OF ALLICATING MORE OF OUR THINKING TOWARD ANALYZING WHY THINGS MIGHT BE GOING WRONG AND SOMETHING ELSE POWERFUL HAPPENS WHEN WE EMBRACE A STRESSES ENHANCING MIND SEID AS WELL WHEN WE EMBRACE A STRESSES ENHANCING MIND SET IT TURNS OUT THAT SOME OF THE VERY PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT WE CALL QUOTIN QUO STRESS SHIFT IN IMPORTANT WAYS SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE THE DURATION OVER WHICH THE STRESS HORMON CORTIS ALL IS RELEASED AND IN FACT I DONLY MERELY WANT TO CALL AT A STRESS HORMON BECAUSE CORTISALL DOES SO MANY OTHER THINGS AS WELL AND IT'S NOT BAD YOU NEED CORTISAL BELIEVING YOU WANT CORTIS ALSPECIALLY RELEASED EARLY IN THE DAY IN IN RESPONSE TO ACUTE STRESSERS WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IS FOR CORTISAL TO STAY ELEVATED FOR LONG LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND YOU ESPECIALLY DON'T WANT IT TO INTERFERE WITH YOUR SLEEP E SO MUCH SO THAT I THINK AT TIMES I WONDER WHETHER NOT OUR PHILOSOPHY ON STRESS SHOULD BE THAT STRESS IS FANTASTIC FOR US EXCEPT WHEN IT INTERFERES WITH OUR SLEEP ITAND WHEN STRESS BECOMES TERRIBLE FOR US AS WHEN IT STRARTS TO BE CHRONICALLY ELEVATED AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT STARTS TO INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO SLEEP WELL ENOUGH AND LONG ENOUGH OK SO THE POINT HERE IS THAT WHEN WE EMBRACE A STRESS IS ENHANCING MIND SET WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE SHORTER DURATION RELEASE OF CORTESAL WE ARE ALSO ABLE TO ENGAGE WHAT'S CALLED INCREASED STROKE VOLUME UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS THIS GETS A LITTLE BUT TECHNICAL BUT THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD THAT YOUR HEART CAN PUMP WITH EACH BEAT TURNS OUT TO BE A KEY METRIC OF STRESS WHEN WE ARE VERY STRESSED EVEN THOUGH WE NEED TO MOBILIZE A LOT OF RESOURCES SOMEWHAT PARADOXICALLY OUR TOTAL STROKE VOLUME CAN ACTUALLY BE REDUCED AND WE TEND TO SHUTTLE BLOOD IN OTHER RESOURCES TOWARDS THE CORE OF OUR BODY AND TOWARDS MAJOR LIMBS AND AWAY FROM THINGS LIKE OUR BRAIN IN OUR PERIPHERY SO ONE OF THE KEY MEASURES OF HOWA STRESS RESPONSE COTICL IS GOING IS HOW MUCH PARIFERAL BLOOD FLOW THERE IS AND WHEN WE ARE MORE RELAXED UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS THERE TENDS TO BE MORE PERIFERAL BLOOD FLOW HEN WE ARE MORE ANXIOUS MORE PANICD UNDER CONDITIONS OF TRESS PERIFERAL BLOOD FLOW IS LOWER AND IN A REMARKABLE SET OF EXPERIMENTS ALLYCRUM AND COLLEAGUES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN WE ARE JUST TAUGHT THAT STRESS CAN BE ENHANCING AND THEN WE ARE PLACED INTO A STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT EITHER BECAUSE WE ARE IMAGINING STRESS OR WE ARE EXPERIENCING REAL STRESS AND THEN OUR PHYSIOLOGY IS MEA SURED WHAT IS OBSERVED IS THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BLOOD THAT THE HEART CAN PUMP WITH EACH BEAT IS ACTUALLY INCREASE PERFERAL BLOOD FLOW INCREASES AND OURABILITY TO MAINTAIN COGNITION TO THINK CLEARLY UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS INCREASES AND AGAIN THE ONLY MANIPULATION HERE IS A TUTORIAL ABOUT HOW STRESS CAN BE ENHANCING WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW IN FACT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT PERHAPS HAVE HEARD STRESS REDUCES TO STOSTRONE LEVELS STRESS REDUCES ESTERGEN LEVELS ET CETERA THAT'S TRUE IT IS ALSO TRUE BY THE WAY THAT WHEN YOU ARE INFORMED ABOUT HOW STRESS CAN BE ENHANCING OF PERFORMANCE IT BECOMES ANABOLIC THAT'S RIGHT IT ACTUALLY CAN LEAD TO DEPLOYMENT OF ANDROGENS AN ESTEROGENS THINGS THAT MANY NOT ALL PEOPLE DESIRE TO HAVE INCREASED OR CERTAINLY DESIRE TO NOT HAVE DIMINISH BELOW THEIR NORMAL BASE LINE SO THERE'S A LOT OF FALSE STORIES OUT THERE ABOUT STRESS NOT FALSE BECAUSE WHAT YOUR HEARING IS WRONG BECAUSE INDEED CHRONIC STRESS CHRONICALLY ELEVATED QUARTES ALL CAN REDUCE TOSTOSTRON REDUCE ESTERGEN DIMINISH SLEEP DIMINISH A MUNITY ET CETERA BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT STRESS UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE ONE BELIEVES THAT STRESS CAN BE ENHANCING CAN BE ANABLIC IT CAN BE PRO TESTOSTRONE PROHESTEROGEN IT CAN BE PRO QUARTIS ALL REGULATION AND WAYS THAT ALLOW YOU TO FOCUSS YOUR COGNITION AND SO ON AND SO FORTH NOW THAT'S EXCITING BUT I DO REALIZE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE IT MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY VAGUE TO MAKE YOU WONDER WELL HOW DO I KNOW IF I'M GETTING THE RIGHT RESPONSE FROM STRSS OF THE WRONG RESPONSE AND THE SIMPLE ANSWER THERE IS THE MORE THAT YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT HOW STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE AND THE MORE THAT YOU PLACE YOURSELF INTO SAFE I WANT O UNDERSCORT SAFE YET STRESSFUL ADAPTOVE CIRCUMSTANCES THESE ARE GOIN TO BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU STAND TO LEARN OR GROW IN SOME POSITIVE WAY NOT CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU STAND TO HURT YOURSELF OR OTHERS OF COURSE THE MORE THAT YOU CAN PLACE YOURSELF INTO CONDITIONS OF STRESS AND THEN TO COGNITIVELY JUST TELL YOURSELF OD THIS ELEVATED HEARTRATE THIS A QUAKING OF MY HANDS THIS YOU SWEATING ET CETERA THIS IS MY BODY MOBILIZING RESOURCES AND THE MORE THT YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY AFFORDING YOU AN ADVANTAGE IN BEING ABLE TO ALLICATE YOUR ATTENTION TO SPECIFIC THINGS MAYBE WHY YOU MADE AN ERROR AND ANALYZING THAT OR MAYBE WHY YOU SUCCEEDED AT SOMETHING AND THINKING ABOUT THE STEPS THAT LED TO THAT SUCCESS THE MORE THAT YOU CAN LINK THAT BACK TO THE PROCESSES THAT ARE TAKING YOU IN THE DIRECTIONS THAT YOU DO AND DON'T WANT TO GO AND THINKING ABOUT THEM BECAUSE INDEED THAT'S WHAT STRESS CAN ALLOW YOU TO DO THE MORE THAT YU ARE SHIFTING YOUR MIND AWAY FROM THINKING ABOUT JUST THE RAW UNCOMFORTABLE SENSATIONS OF STRESS YOU'RE PUTTING A COGNATIVE APPRASAL ON A PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT STRESS IN A WAY THAT IS CHANGING WHAT THAT STRESS IS DOING AND YOU'RE TAKING YOUR BRAIN AND BODY FROM A NEGATIVE STATE JUST TO PUT A LLE BIT OF SUBJECT TIVE VEILANCE ON IT NEGATIVE RIGHT NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THE BAD STRESS RESPONSE TO A POSITIVE STATE AND WHEN YOU DEVELOP A STRESSES ENHANCING MIND SET YOU NOT ONLY ARE GOING TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS BUT YOU ARE ALSO DEVELOPING THE PERFECT TOOL TO PLUG INTO THE WHOLE PROCESS OF BUILDING UP YOUR GROWTH MIND SET IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THOSE TWO THINGS GROWTH MIND SET AND STRESSES EN HANCING MINDS ET TO SINERGIZE AND TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM AND THAT'S NOT JUST A STATEMENT THAN I'M MAKING THAT'S WHAT THE RESEARCH TELLS US SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT RESEARCH SO NOW LIKE TO SHIFT OUR DISCUSSION TO SOME VERY RECENT FINDINGS ABOUT GROWTH MIND SET AND HOW GROWTH MIND SET COMBINED WITH THE STRESSES ENHANCING MIND SET CAN POWERFULLY CHANGE OUTCOMES FOR THE BETTER AND CAN DO SO IN A HUGE VARIETY OF REAL WORLD CONTECTS AND THE WORK THAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THE WORK OF A PERSONNAME DAVID YAGER DOCTOR DAVID YAGGER IS A PROFESSOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTIN HE DID HIS GRADUATE WORK WITH CARROLL DWACKET STAMFORD AND HE NOW AS HIS OWN LABORATORY AN AUSTEN AND BOTH WHEN HE WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT WITH CAROL END IN HIS OWN LABORATORY HE'S BEEN DOING VERY IMPRESSIVE LARGE SCALE STUDIES MEANING MANY THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS SO THAT ITSELF IS IMPORTANT AND USING SUBJECTS FROM DIVERSE AREAS RURAL URBAN ET CETERA DIFFRENT LEVELS OF AFFLUENCE LACK OF AFFLUENCE AND FRONTING ESSENTIALLY THAT WHEN STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT ABOUT O GROWTH MINE SET WHAT IT IS HOW IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A FIXED MINE SET AND WHEN THOSE SAME STUDENTS ARE ALSO TAUGHT ABOUT WHAT A STRESSES ENHANCING MINE SET IS AND CULTIVATING THAT AGAIND SIMPLY THROUGH INFORMATIONAL TUTORIAL WATCHING A VIT ABOUT GROWTH MIN SET WATCHING A VITY ABOUT STRESSES ENHANING MINE SETS AND THEN CONFRONTED WITH STRESS CONFRONTED WITH TESTS CONFRONTED WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO EMBRACE HARD CHALLENGES OR EASIER PATHS ACROSS THE BOARD THE RESULTS SHOW UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AS STUDENTS WHO ARE TAUGHT ABOUT A GROWTH MINE SET AND ARE TAUGHT THAT STRESSES ENHANCING PERFORM BETTER NOW YET YER AND COLLEAGUES HAVE SHOWN THAT ACROSS A HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS IN FACT THERE'S A PAPER PUBLISHED QUITE RECENTLY THIS WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN THE JOURNAL NATURE SA PEX JOURNAL PUBLISHES A FULL ARTICLE IN NATURE AND SCIENCE AND ELSEWHERE THEY HAVE LETTERS AND SHORTER FOREMATS LIKE REPORTS AND THEN THERE ARE THE ARTICLES WHICH CORRESPOND TO MAJOR MAJOR FINDING SO THEY PUBLISHED A THE FOLLOWING RESULTS AS AN ARTICLE IN NATURE IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS A SYNERGISTIC MIND SETS INTERVENTION PROTECTS ADOLESCENCE FROM STRESS AND WHAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ABOUT THIS PAPER IS THAT IT INCLUDES A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS SO FOR INSTANCE THEY LOOKED AT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO SIMPLY ANTICIPATED A STRESSFUL EVENT AND HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED ON GROWTH MINE SET OR STRESSES ENHANCING MIND SET OR BOTH OR CONTROL CONDITIONS WHERE THEY WEREN'T INFORMED OF THOSE MINE SETS RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS IMPORT TO HAVE CONTROL EXPERIMENTS WHERE YOU'RE GTTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BUT IT'S NOT THUS SAYIN NG INFORMATION AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT ANTICIPATORY STRESS RIGHT THE STRESS THAT WE FEEL IN ANTICIPATION OF SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS REDUCED WHEN WE ARE EDUCATED ABOUT GROWTH MINE SET AND WE ARE EDUCATED ABOUT ASTRESSES ENHANCING MINE SET AND THE BASIS TAKE AWAY FROM THAT EXPERIMENT WAS YES INDEED BEING EDUCATED ON WHAT A GROWTH MIN SET IS AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM A FIXED MIND SET WHICH YOU NOW HAVE BEEN EDUCATED ON DEFINITELY BUFFERS YOU AGAINST STRESS IN ADDITION BEING EDUCATED ON HOUSE STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE CAN BUFFER YOU AGAINST ANTICIPATORY STRESS BUT IT IS CLEARLY THE CASE THAT WHEN ONE IS EDUCATED ON BOTH OF THOSE THINGS GROWTH MIND SET END STRESSES AND HANCING MINE SETS THAT ONE OBSERVES THE GREATEST BUFFERING OR OFFSET OF THE STRESS RESPONSE IN WAYS THAT CAN IMPROVE PERFORMANCE NOW THAT IS BUT ONE EXPERIMENT OF THE SIX YES SIX EXPERIMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS SINGLE PAPER NOW I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THOSE SIX EXPERIMENTES IN DETAIL AND JUST AS A SIDE NO DOUBT OF INVITED DOCTOR DAVID YAGER TO BE A GUESSED ON THIS PODCAST AND HE HAS AGREED SO WHEN HEIS A GUESED ON THIS PODCASTS I'M SURE HE WILL DETAIL ALL THE INTRICACIES OF THOSE EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO INFORM US ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS DONE IN HOW SO THAT WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT INFORMATION BUT JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ANOTHER EXPERIMENT IN THIS PAPER USE WHAT WAS CALLED THE TRAIRE SOCIAL STRESS TEST AND THE REASON I AM GOING TO HIGH LIKE THIS A LITTLE BIT IS BECAUSE I THINK IT RELATES TO A LOT OF THINGS THAT MANY OF US HAVE EXPERIENCE AND THAT WILL EXPERIENCS THAT ARE CONSIDERED STRESSFUL AND OF COURSE WE WOULD ALL LIKE WAYS TO BUFFER OURSELVES AGAINST STRESS AND OR LEVERAGE THAT STRESS TO IMPROVE OUR PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS ADOPT A GROWTH MINE SET SO THE TIRE SOCIAL STRESS TRESS IS A AN A STANDARD MODE OF STRESSING PEOPLE OUT IN THE LABORATORY OR IN THE CLASS ROOM WHERE BUSILY A SUBJECT COMES IN YOU TELL THEM TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME THEN YOU MEASURE THEIR STRESS RESPONSE AT REST LOOKING AT THEIR HEART RAT THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE YOU MIGHT HAVE THEM SPIT INTO A LITLE TOBE AND USE THAT SUL LIVA TO MEASURE CORTUS ALL THAT'S HOW YOU MEASURE CARTUS ALL THEN YOU'RE GOING TO TELL THEM THAT THEYRE GOING TO PREPARE A SPEECH FOR PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF A SMALL GROUP OF ACTUAL PEOPLE THEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO DELIVER THAT SPEECH IN FRONT OF THAT AUDIENCE JURING THAT SPEECH SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OBSERVING IT ARE GIVING FEED BACK LIKE FROWNS CROSSED ARMS ET CETERA THEN THERE'S A POP QUIZ WHERE THEY GET A HARD ARITHMETIC TEST IN FRONT OF THAT AUDIENCE AND WHEN THEY GET ANSWERS WRONG THEY'RE TOLD THEIR WRONG IN FRONT OF THAT AUDIENCE THIS ALL MIGHT SEEM KIND OF PLAYFUL AND SILLY TO YOU BUT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT EXPERIENCES AS PLAYFUL AND SILLY ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO GOES INTO ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS AS A SUBJECT FEEL SOME LEVEL OF STRESS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DON'T LIKE PUBLIC SPEAKING ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DON'T SEE THEMSELVES AS VERY PROFICIENT IN ARITHMETIC WHERE THEY DON'T LIKE TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS IN REAL TIME IN FRONT OF PEOPLEWE CAN SEEL THIS WAY WOULD BE STRESSFUL AND ALL THE WHILE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIVITY ARE BEING MEASURED PERIFERAL BLOODFLOW THE THING WE TALKE ABOUT EARLIER AMONG THOSE WHAT I JUST STRIBED IS PRETTY EXTENSIVE BUT I PROVIDE ALL THAT IS A BACK DROP SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPEN BEFORE WHICH WAS PEOPLE WERE SIMPLY EDUCATED ON GROWTH MIND SET HOW IT DIFFERS FROM FIXED MIND SET AND OR STRESS AND HANCIS PERFORMANCE MIND SET OR NOT SO BASILY WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A CONDITION IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE JUST GETTING INFORMATION RIGHT THERE'S NO PILL THERE'S NO TREAD MILL THERE'S NO GOING HOME AND DOING A BUNCH OF PROBLEM SETS AND WHAT THEY OBSERVE IN THIS EXPERIMENT AND ALL THE OTHER EXPERIMENTS  CONTAINED WITHIN THIS QUITE MASSIVE PAPER IS THAT THE MERE LEARNING ABOUT GROWTH MINE SET AND STRESSES EN HANCING MIND SETS ALLOWS THESE STUDENTS TO SHIFT THEIR PHYSIOLOGY SO INHANCE PERFERAL BLOOD FLOW CHANGES IN HORMON SECRETION LIKE CARTUS ALL AND SHIFTS IN THEIRE PSYCHOLOGY SUCH THAT WHEN THEY FEEL STRESSED THEY START TO SEE THAT AND EXPERIENCE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHALLENGE AND TO LEAN INTO THAT CHALLENGE AND WHERE THEY ARE TOLD THAT THEY GOT THE WRONG ANSWER WHERE THEY ARE TOLD THAT THEY ARE NOT PERFORMING WELL THEY ARE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND TO ALICATE THEIR MENTAL RESOURCES SUCH THAT THAT THEY DO START TO PERFORM BETTER AND THE MAJOR TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY IS THAT ACROSS THE BOARD IN ALL SIX EXPERIMENTS AN IMAGINE STRESS IN REAL STRESS LABORATORY STRESS ACTUAL CLASSFROM STRESS AND INEMBRACING FUTURE CHALLENGES JUST THE LEARNING ABOUT WHAT STRESS CAN ENHANCE YOUR PERFORMANCE MINE SET IS A LOUD STUDENTS TO DO JUST THAT NOW ANOTHER REALLY INTERESTING FEATURE OF THIS STUDY PUT OUT BY YGRAN COLLEAGUES WAS THAT THE INTERVENTIONS WERE ONE TIME AND RELATIVELY BRIEF OR WE COULD EVEN SAY EXTREMELY BRIEF WHEREAS A LOT OF PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS HAD LOOKED AT GROWTHMINE SET INTERVENTIONS THAT WERE ON THE ORDER OF IN A FOUR TO SIX TO EIGHT TUTORIALS LASTING ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY MINUTES TO AN HOUR EACH THIS EXPERIMENT EMPLOYED JUST ONE THIRTY MINUTE INTERVENTION SO WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THESE RESULTS AND READ THE PAPER I GOT VERY EXCITED I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS THIS MAGIC INTERVENTION EXACTLY AND I'M SURE YOU'RE THINKING THE SAME SO I CONTACTED DOCTOR YEGER AND HE WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO PROVIDE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S CONTAINED WITHIN THE TORTORIAL SO THAT I COULD GIVE YOU THOSE EXAMPLES IN REAL TIME DURING THIS EPISODE SO BASICALLY THE TUTORIAL STARTS OFF WITH A QUESTION ABOUT STRESS IT ACTALY HAS A LITTLE FIELD WHERE YOU CAN FILL IN IN ANSWER TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTION CAN YOU RECALL A TIME WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE STRESS AND WHAT WAS THAT STRESS RELATED TO AND HERE ON PERAPHRASING SO WHAT I PUT IN RESPONSE TO THIS CAUSE I ACTUALLY FILLED OUT  THE FORM ITSELF WAS WHEN I WAS A POSTSTOC WHICH BY THE WAY IS THE FOR A SIX YAR PERIOD OF TIME THAT COMES AFTER YOUR PIAGETY TRAINING I WROTE WHEN I WAS A POST STOC I WAS UNDER A LOT OF COMPETITIVE PRESSURE TO TRY AND FINISH MY PROJECTS I WAS WORKING UNDER A DIMINISHED INCOME MEANING I WAS CANIN PAID VERY MUCH RELATIVE TO THE COST OF LIVING IN THE AREI LIVED AT THE TIME AND I WAS ALSO SOCIALLY ISOLATED FROM A LOT OF MY FRIENDS THAT PREVIOUSLY HI HAD LIVED VERY CLOSE TO THAT WAS A STRESSFUL TIME THAT I COULD RECALL IN FACT NO OTHER TIME IN MY LIFE AS I RECALL WAS AS STRESSFUL AS BEING A POSTOCH WHICH DOES NOT TO SAY THAT I DIDN'T ENJOY BEING A POSTOCH I DELIGHTED IN DOING THE SCIENCE I DID AND BEING SURROUNDED BY THE PEOPLE I WAS SURROUNDED BY BUT IT WAS VERY VERY STRESSFUL FOR THOSE AND ADDITIONAL REASONS SO THAT'S HOW THIS TUTORIAL STARTS OFF AND I BELIEVE THAT THE REASON THAT THEY ASKED THAT QUESTION OF TE BEGIN OF THE TUTORAL IS THE KIND OF CEW UP COGNITIVE MECHANISMS THAT SURROUND ONE'S OWN UNDERSTANDING OF STRESS AND THEN AS YOU CLICK THROUGH THE TUTORIAL IT STARTS TO EXPLAIN OF ALL THINGS NEURO SCIENCE IN NEURO PLASTICITY IT SAYS RESEARCH FROM NOROW SCIENCE TELLS US THAT THROUGH EFFORT OUR BRAIN CAN CHANGE IT CAN FORM NEW CONNECTIONS THAT WE CALL SYNNAPSES SO COURSE I WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ALL THAT INFORMATION I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION IT ALSO SAYS THINGS LIKE AND HERE I'M READING DIRECTLY FROM THE TUTORIAL DIFFICULTY STRUGGLE AND FRUSTRATION WHEN YOU'RE LEARNING SOMETHING ARE NOT SIGNS THAT YOU'VE REACHD YOUR LIMITS THERE SIGNS THAT YOU'RE EXPANDING YOUR LIMITS GET THEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT FIELD AND IT SAYS LET'S HERE FROM A SCIENTIST RETRISESMAN IS ONE OF THE TOP CALCULOUS PROFESSORS HERE'S WHAT HE TELLS US STUDENTS ON THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS QU EVERYONE IN THIS CLASS WILL STRUGGLE NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE FLYING AT YOU THAT YOU CANNOT ANSWER AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE STRESS AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT STRESS YOU'LL THINK IT MEANS OH NO I DON'T BELONG HERE BUT IN FACT THAT STRESS IS AN INDICATOR THAT YOU'RE UNDERSTANDING IS DEEPENING IT'S NOT A SCIGN THAT YOU'RE NOT LEARNING IT'S A SIGN THAT YOU ARE LEARNING O CA SO I COULD READ THIS ENTIRE TUTORIAL FOR YOU BUT THAT WOULD TAKE UP FAR TOO MUCH OF OUR TIME BUT I THINK YOU GET THE ESSENCE OF IT WHICH IS THAT WITH EACH SLIDE WITHIN THE TUTORIAL YOU'R BEING TOLD THAT THE THING THAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY FEEL NEGATIVE BECAUSE IT MEAN 'S NEGATIVE THINGS YOU'RE NOT LEARNING YOU'RE SUFFERING YOU'RE SUFFERING HEALTHWISE YOU'R SUFFERING PERFORMANCE WISE IS REAPPRAISED ITS TELLING YOU NO THE FRUSTRATION THE AGITATION THE THOUGHT THAT YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE AND YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE OF GETTING BETTER IT'S ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE SO WHAT THIS TUTORIAL REALLY IS IS ITS AN INFORMATION BASE TUTORIAL TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE BRAINS CAPACITY O CHANGE IT GIVES YOU SOME TRUE BY THE WAY MECHANISTIC INFORMATION ABOUT HOSSINAPSES CAN CHANGE AND BRAIN CIRCUITS CAN CHANGE CAUSE INDEED THEY CAN END ITS TELLING YOU THAT THE NEGATIVE SOMATIC BODILY AND COGNITIVE THOUGHT BASED EXPERIENCES OF STRESS THAT THOSE REPRESENT YOU GETTING BETTER THAT SIMPLY WHAT IT IS AND DESPITE IT BEING SIMPLE IN ITS SPECIFIC MESSAGE THAT MESSAGE TURNS OUT TO BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL HOW CAN WE SAY THAT ITS TRULY POWERFUL WELL WE COULD TURN TO ESSENTIALLY ANY PAGE IN THIS STUDY THAT YEGGER AND COLLEAGUES DID AND SEE THAT FOR INSTANCE THE INTERVENTION AGAIN THIS IS THE COMMINATION OF LEARNING ABOUT GROWTH MINE SET END LEARNING THAT STRESS CAN BE PERFORMANCE IN HANCING LED TO FORTY PER CENT IMPROVEMENT IN RESELF REGARD SO SELF REGARD IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MEASURED WE CAN HAVE VERY NEGATIVE OR VERY POSITIVE SELF REGARD FORTY PER CENT IMPROVEMENTS AND SELF REGARD THERE WAS A FORTEEN PER CENT IMPROVEMENT IN PASSING OF COURSES THAT WERE OF THE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TYPE AND THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PASSING OF COURSES THAT WERE LESS CHALLENGING IN ADITION THAT PEOPLE WHO WATCH AND ENGAGED IN THIS THIRTY MENUTE TUTORIAL ALSO TOOK ON ADDITIONAL HARD CHALLEGES IN THE FUTURE LONG AFTER THE INTERVENTION HAD CEASED NOW THERE ARE NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES OF THE DAVIDYEGGER WORK THAT I THINK ARE A SPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER BUT RATHER THAN GOING TO THE SPECIFICS OF THOSE EXPERIMENTS I'M GOING TO FRAME THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF SOME VERY SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT I'VE SPELLED OUT FOR SAKE OF THIS EPISODE BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THAT YOU CAN USE IN ORDER TO BUILD A GROWTH MINE SET END IN ORDER TO BUILD THE STRESS ENHANCE IS PERFORMANCE MIND SET NOW IN SOME SENSE ALL OF OUR DISCUSSION DURING THIS EPISODE UP UNTIL NOW HAS SERVED AS A TUTORIAL ABOUT GROWTH MIND SET AND ABOUT STRESS ENHANCE IS PERFORMANCE AND HOW THOSE TWO THINGS CAN BE COMBINED IN ORDER TO GET A SYNERGISTIC POSITIVE EFFACT NONE THE LESS I DO THINK THAT IT'S USEFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN THINKING ABOUT COGNITIVE TOOLS WHICH ARE OFTEN LESS CONCRETE AND AM CLEAR TO PEOPLE HOW THEY CAN IMPLEMENT THEM COMPARED TO SAY EXERCISE TOOLS LIKE YOU KNOW GET TOMEN HUNDRED MINUTES OF ZON TO CARDIO PER WEEK OR GET SIX SETS OF RESISTANCE EXERCISE PERMAJOR MUSSE GRUP AREK ET CETERA ALL OF THAT STUFF IN THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN IS VERY CONCRETE WHEREAS STUFF THAT RELATES TO TOOLS IN THE COGNITIVE DOMAIN SOMETIMES CAN FEEL A LITTLE ABSTRACT SO FOR THAT REASON I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND LIST OFF SOME OF THE KEY ELEMENTS TO BUILDING UP A GROWTH MIND SET AND A STRESS ENHANCE IS PERFORMANCE MIND SET THAT ARE GLEAND FROM THE LITERATURE THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT NOW AND RELATED LITERATURE THE FIRST TOOL IS THAT WHENEVER POSSIBLE IF BOTH THE TEACHER AND THE STUDENT CAN ADOPT A GROWTH MIND SET AND A STRESS ENHANCE IS PERFORMANCE MIND SET THAT'S THE BESS CASE CENARIO THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE CLASS ROOM AND IT'S BEEN SHOWN IN OTHER CONTEXTS AS WELL AND AGAIN IT SIMPLY MEANS LEARNING ABOUT WHAT GROWTH MINE SET IS AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM FIXED MIND SET IT ALSO IDEALLY MEANS LEARNING HOW STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE NOW IF THAT MEANS SPENDING SOME TIME WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD AROUND DOCTOR ALEA CRUM'S DATA THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT ALSO MEANS JUST THINKING ABOUT THE STRESS RESPONSE AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT STRESS RESPONSE INDEED IS MOBILIZING RESOURCES ITS FOCUSSING YOUR VISION MORE NARROWLY RIGHT YUS SO LOSE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES AND YET THAT ALLOWS YOU TO REALLY ANALYZE CAREFULLY WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU CHOOSE TO FOCUSS YOUR ATTENTION ON WELL THEN THAT'S GOIN G TO BE PERFORMANCE ENHANCING AGAIN THESE TOOLS ARE PURELY COGNITIVE BUT THEY ARE WELL SUPPORTED BY THE DATA AND THE DATE ALSO TELL USE THAT WHEN TEACHERS AND STUDENTS BOTH ADOPT THIS MIND SET THE TEACHERS ARE VIEWING THE STUDENTS AS LESS FIXED IN THEIR ABILITIES AND THE STUDENTS ARE VIEWING THEMSELVES AS LESS FIXED IN THEIR ABILITIES THE NEXT TOOL WHICH IS A REALLY FUNDAMENTAL ONE TO EVERYTHING WERE TALKING BOUT WAS ACTUALLY MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WHICH IS WHENEVER GIVING PRAISE OR GIVING FEED BACK OF ANY KIND TO OTHERS OR TO YOURSELF PERHAPS EVEN ESPECIALLY TO YOURSELF MAKE THE EFFORT TO MAKE THACT FEED BACK ABOUT VERBS NOT LABELS O K TO REALLY THINK ABOUT PRASING OR IN SOME CASES MAY BE GIVING FEED BACK ABOUT HOW EFFORT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT IDEALLY YOU'RE SAYING GREAT EFFORT IT WAS GREAT THAT WHEN YOU MISSED THAT SHOT ON GOAL THAT YOU RAN BACK TO YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD IT WAS GREAT THAT WHEN YOU DIDN'T PERFORM WELL ON THAT MATHEXAM THAT YOU WENT BACK TO THOSE PROBLEM SETS AND THAT YOU CONVERSED WITH OTHER STUDENTS ABOUT WHY THEY HAD PERFORMED A CERTAIN WAY AND YOU REALLY DUG THROUGH IT AND FIGURED OUT WHY YOU GOT THINGS WRONG NOW A KEY ASPECT OF THIS TOOL OF FOCUSING ON VERBS NOT LABELS IS THAT IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO DO THIS WHEN YOU'VE PERFORMED WELL I TALKED ABOUT THE REASONS ALITLEBIT EARLIER BUT I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH WHEN YOU'VE PERFORMED WELL IF YOU TELL YOURSELF OR YOU TELL SOMEBODY ELSE THAT THEY'RE JUST A GREAT ATHLETE THEY'RE JUST A GREAT STUDENT THEIR TALENTED THEIR BRILLIANT I PROMISE YOU YOU ARE UNDERMINING THEIR FUTURE PERFORMANCE WHEN THEY INEVITABLY ENCOUNTER CHALLENGE IF HOWEVER YOU GIVE YOURSELF FOR THE OTHER PERSON FEED BACK THAT'S REALLY GROUNDED IN EFFORT IN PERSISTENTS IN PROBLEM SOLVING YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION NOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE FEED BACK ABOUT ERRORS EITHER TO YOURSELF OR TO SOMEBODY ELSE THE QUESTION REALLY IS DO YOU PAINT THAT WITH ROSE COLORED GLASSES DO YOU TRY AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THE ERRORS WEREN'T THAT T BAD THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHATEARE THEY SAY PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A PIG WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS LOOKING AT THOSE ERRORS AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT LED UP TO THOSE ERRORS AND TRYING TO PUT MORE OF OUR COGNITIVE ATTENTION ON THE VERBS THE THINGS THAT LED TO THOSE ERRORS AND LESS OF OUR ATTENTION ON THE IMMOTIONS RELATED TO THOSE ERRORS WE REALLY NEED TO BE ANALYTIC ABOUT THOSE ERRORS AND ADMITTEDLY WE OFTEN NEED TO TAKE A DAY OR TWO ERE MAYBE EVEN LONGER BEFORE WE CAN DO THAT PROCESS EFFECTIVELY RIGHT NOTHING THAT I'VE SAID THUS FAR HAS SAID THAT WE HAVE TO DO ALL THIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER AN ERROR WERE IMMEDIATELY AFTER A POOR PERFORMANCE SOMETIMES WE ARE SO CAUGHT UP IN THE EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE OF HAVING PERFORMED NOT AS WELL AS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY THAT WE CAN ALICATE OUR MENTAL RESOURCES TOWARD ERROR ANALYSIS IDEALLY WE CAN BUT OFTENTIMES WE CAN'T SO WE HAVE TO BE OU OF THEY SAY GENTLE WITH OURSELVES AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO MOVE THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND THEN GET BACK TO ERROR ANALYSIS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY KEY BUT WE REALLY WANT A FOCUS ON THE VERBS LEADING TO THOSE ERRORS NOT PUTTING LABELS ON THE STUPID RIDICULOUS SILLY FILL IN YOUR BLANK WITH WHATEVER NEGATIVE LABEL YOU MIGHT HAPPEN TO COME UP WITH SO VERBS VERBS VERBS FOR ANALYZE WHY WE DID WELL AND VERBS VERBS VERBS FOR ANALYZING WHY WE DID POORLY NOW YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT A FEW MINUTES AGO I MENTION THAT OFTEN TIMES ITS BENEFICIAL THAT WHEN WE MAKE ERRORS THAT WE SEEK OUT OTHERS WHO EITHER PERFORMED WELL IDEALLY BUT ALSO THOSE WHO PERFORMED POORLY IN ORDER TO GET SOME UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY WE DID NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS WE WANTED AND THAT RAISES ANOTHER KEY TOOL THERE ARE A LOT OF DATANOW TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE KEY WAYS TO ANALYZE OUR ERRORS IS TO GET HELP YEND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY DIFFERENTIATES THE HIGH PERFORMERS FROM THE LOW PERFORMERS OVER TIME AND YES THERE I JUST USED TO LABEL I GUESS I COULD HAVE SAID THE HIGH EFFORT WHICH LEADS TO PERFORMANCE PEOPLE VERSES THE LOW EFFORT WHICH LEADS THE LOW PERFORMANCE PEOPLE BUT IN ANY CASE YOU GET THE IDEA PEOPLE WHO PERFORM WELL OVER TIME REGARDLESS OF LABELS THAT WE PLACE ON THEM TEND TO BE PEOPLE WHO SEEK HELP IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DIDN'T PERFORM WELL SO THIS IS A CORE COMPONENT OF NOT JUST TRYING AND BUILDING A GROWTH MINE SET BUT REALLY SOLIDIFYING A GROWTH MIN SET AND A STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE MIND SET SO SEEK HELP FROM OTHERS IN UNDERSTANDING WHERE YOU DIDN'T PERFORM AS WELL AS YOU LIKE AND I WOULD SAY SEEK IN PUT FROM OTHERS AS TO WHAT WERE THE VERBS THAT YOU THINK MIGHT HAVE LED TO YOUR HEIGHTEN PERFORMANCE BECAUSE WE LIKE TO THINK THAT WE HAVE REALLY GOOD OPTECTS ON WHY WE DID WELL O YA IS BECAUSE I SPENT EXT NUMBER OF OURS PRACTICING BUT OFTENTIMES THOSE AROUND US HAVE ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVES THAT WE CAN'T ACCESS AND LEARNING ABOUT THOSE PERSPECTIVES OF WHY WE P PERFORMED POORLY ABUT ALSO WHY WE PERFORMED WELL IN THE CONTEXTS OF THESE VERBS NOT LABELS IS ALSO TREMENDOUSLY BENEFICIAL THE OTHER THING THAT'S CLEAR FROM THE LITERATURE ON GROWTH MINE SET AND STRESSCAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE MIND SET IS THAT ALL OF THAT STUFF ALL THOSE TUTORIALS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS EMBRACE THOSE MIN SETS NOW THAT'S A WONDERFUL SITUATION IF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ARE BOTH AVAILABLE AND WILLING TO LEARN THOSE MIN SETS HOWEVER FOR MANY OF US WE DON'T HAVE A TEACHER WE DON'T HAVE A MENTOR WERE DOING ALL OF THIS ON OUR OWN AND SO WHAT'S FORTUNATE IS THAT THERE ARE ALSO DATA IN THE LITERATURE SHOWING THAT UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE EITHER THE TEACHER OR THE MENTOR IS NOT THERE OR IS NOT EMBRACING A GROWTH MINE SET OR STRESS ENHANCE ITS PERFORMANCE MIND SET WE ACTUALLY CONSERVE AS OUR OWN TEACHER BY USING A SIMPLE TOOL AND THE SIMPLE TOOL THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE SAME TOOL THAT WAS USED IN ONE OF THE YAGER STUDIES IS TO TAKE MAYBE A THREE BY FIVE CARD OR AN AIHT AND HALF BY LEAVEN SHEET OF PAPER AND WRITE OUT A LETTER AS IF YOURE WRITING A LETTER TO THE NEXT PERSON COMING ALONG TRYING TO GET GOOD AT THE HING THAT YOURE TRYING TO GET GOOD AT AND EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT GROWTH MIND SAID IS AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM A FIXED MIND SET EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THE STRESS ENHANCE ITS PERFORMANCE MIND SAID IS HOW TO ADOPT IT AND HOW IT CAN AMPLIFY PERFORMANCE THAT SIMPLE EXERCISE OF WRITING A LETTER WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY TO ONESELF BUT YOUR SORT OF PRETENDING THAT THE LETTERS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE YOU COULD AND PERHAPS SHOULD GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE O THEY CAN BENEFIT THAT SIMPLE EXERCISE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE ONE'S OWN PERFORMANCE AND TO DO SO IN DRAMATIC WAYS NONCIOUS IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM BUT ALSO IN THE FUTURE NOW THE FINAL TOOL I LIKE TO SHARE IS ONE THAT I'VE COME UP WITH BUT IT'S ONE THATS REALLY GROUNDED IN THE NARROW SCIENCE OF NARROW PLASTICITY AND BELIEVE OR NOT THAT'S GROUNDED IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY AND THAT IS TO REFRAIME THIS IDEA THAT THE MIND IS LIKE A MUSCLE I KNOW WE HEAR THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE MIND IS LIKE A MUSCLE YOU KNOW YOU EXERCISE A MUSCLE THAT GET STRONGER YOU EXERCISE YOUR MIND YOU PUT IT THROUGH SOME STRAIN AND YOU CAN LEARN THOSE STATEMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY TRUE BUT THIS STATEMENT THAT THE MIND IS LIKE A MUSCLE THAT ANALOGY FALL SHORT I BELIEVE IN AN IMPORTANT WAY THAT CAN LEAD A LOT OF PEOPLE ASTRAY WHEN THEY TRY ANO EMBRACE GROWTH MIND SET AND THE STRESS ENHANCE ITS PERFORMANCE MIND SET AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE WITH WEIGHTS OR RESISTANCE TRAINING OF ANY KIND WHETHER NOT ITS BODY WEIGHT OR MACHINES OR FREE WEIGHTS HAS AN INCREDIBLE PROPERTY TO IT IN THAT IT INCREASES BLOOD FLOW TO THE MUSCLES THAT WERE TRAINING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES RESISTANCE TRAINING FROM OTHER FORMS OF TRAINING LIKE LONG DISTANCE RUNNING WHEN WE TRAIN OUR MUSCLES WITH RESISTANCE THE BLOOD FLOW INTO THAT MUSCLE THE SO CALLED PUMP GIVES US A SORT OF A HINT OR A WINDOW OF THE GROWTH OF THAT MUSCLE THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR IF WE ALLOW THAT MUSCLE TO RECOVER AFTER THAT RESISTANCE TRAINING IN OTHER WORDS RESISTANCE TRAINING PROVIDES US A KIND OF HINT OF THE RESULTS WE ARE LIKELY TO GET SO WHEN WE HEAR THE ANALOGY THAT THE MIND IS LIKE A MUSCLE I THINK IT FALLS SHORT BECAUSE WHEN WE STRAIN TO LEARN SOMETHING WITH OUR MIND WE DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO FEEL WHAT IT IS TO PERFORM MUCH BETTER AS WE ARE TRYING TO LEARN THAT THING ACTUALLY QUITE THE CONTRARY IN FACT MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO DAY IS THE FACT THAT THE STRESS AND STRAIN AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IS SO REFLEXIVELY FELT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR DIMINISH PERFORMANCES WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN IS ACTUALLY THE TRIGGER FOR INVOKING THE LEARNING ITSELF SO WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THAT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT WHEN WE GO IN TO LEARN A LANGUAGE OR A NEW SKILL OR MATHEMATICS OR SOMETHING NEW THAT FOR A MOMENT WE ARE FLUENT ARE PARTIALLY FLUENT AND THEN WE LOSE THAT ABILITY WHEN WE WALK OUT OF THE CLASS ROOM OR THE TUTORIAL THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT THEN THE GIM WHERE YOU GO AND YOU LIFT WATS ARE YOU USE RESISTANCE TRAINING OF ANY KIND AND YOU GET THI SORT OF WINDOW AND TO OH THIS IS WHAT THE MUSCLE WILL FEEL LIKE AND LOOK LIKE WHEN IT'S LARGER SO THE MIND IS LIKE A MUSCLE ANALOGY SORT OF WORKS IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU PROPERLY STRESS A MUSCLE USING RESISTANCE TRAINING AND THEN YOU GIVE IT AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF TIME TO RECOVER IT INDEED WILL GET BIGGER AND STRONGER AND IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN YOU GO INTO TRY AND LEARN SOMETHING IF YOU PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE STRESS WHICH IS HITTING THAT POINT WHERE YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANING THE INFORMATION IT'S NOT SINKING IN AND YOU GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME TO RECOVER WHICH REQUIRE SLEEP BY THE WAY THEN YOU'LL LEARN THAT NEW INFORMATION OVER TIME BUT WHERE THE MIND IS LIKE A MUSCLE ANALOGY REALLY FALLS AWAY I BELIEVE IS THAT THE MIND IS NOT LIKE A MUSCLE BECAUSE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO EXPERIENCE THE GOOD GROWTH THAT YOU'RE SEEKING AS YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN IT RATHER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TALKI ABOUT TO DAY IS ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO EXPERIENCE THE STRAIN OF TRYING TO LEARN THE AGITATION OF TRYING TO LEARN AS THE LEARNING PROCESS ITSELF AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WHILE YOU MIGHT FEEL BACK ON YOUR HEELS A LITTLE OR A LOT DURING THAT PROCESS THAT YOU MIG T AND IN FACT VERY LIKELY ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE ALL THE CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH STRESS ELEVATED HEART RATE FRUSTRATION YOU KNOW MAE EVEN HEADACHE OR STRAIN A DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING FOK US ET CETERA THAT IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY CREATING THE SPECIFIC NEUROCHEMICAL AND NEURAL CIRCUIT CONDITIONS TO INVOKE LEARNING WELL THEN THAT LEARNING WILL OCCUR SO IN SOME WAYS OF BETTER ANALOGY WOULD BE IF IT WERE THE CASE THAT WHEN YOU DO RESISTANCE TRAINING THAT YOUR MUSCLES ACTUALLY GOT SMALLER DURING THE TRAINING AND THEN REBOUNDED TO BEING EVEN BIGGER THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE TRAINING THAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE ANALOGY FOR THE MIND IS LIKE A MUSCLE I SAY ALL THIS BECAUSE YES ADOPTING A GROWTH MINE SET IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE ADOPTING A STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE MINE SET IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE AND EVEN MORE VALUABLE IS COMBINING THOSE TWO MINE SETS BECAUSE THEY DO INDEED IMPROVE PERFORMANCE SENERGISTICALLY HOWEVER NONE OF THIS PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO BE REFLECTIVE FOR MOST PEOPL PERHAPS FOR ANYBODY AND THE PROCESS OF BUILDING UP THESE MIN SETS INVOLVES ANOTHER MIN SET WHICH IS THE ONE THAT EMBRELLAS THEM ALL OR GATHERS THEM ALLTOGETHER AND MAKES THEM REALLY WORK WHICH IS THE IDEA THAT MINE SETS ARE INDEED POWERFUL THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE A REAL EFFECT AND THAT WHILE THEY DO TAKE TIME TO CULTIVATE THEY CAN BE CULTIVATED THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME TODAY FOR OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT GROWTH MINE SET WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO CULTIVATE A GROWTH MINE SET AS WELL AS THE RELATED STRESS CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE MIND SET WHICH CAN ALSO BE CULTIVATED
